Mr.
Vavasor
and
His
Daughter

<EOS>
whether
or
no
,
she
,
whom
you
be
to
forgive
,
if
you
can
,
do
or
do
not
belong
to
the
Upper
Ten
thousand
of
this
our
english
world
,
I
be
not
prepared
to
say
with
any
strength
of
affirmation
.
<EOS>
by
blood
she
be
connect
with
big
people
,
 
distantly
connect
with
some
very
big
people
indeed
,
people
who
belong
to
the
Upper
Ten
hundred
if
there
be
any
such
division
;
but
of
these
very
big
relation
she
have
know
and
see
little
,
and
they
have
care
as
little
for
her
.
<EOS>
Her
grandfather
,
Squire
Vavasor
of
Vavasor
Hall
,
in
Westmoreland
,
be
a
country
gentleman
,
possess
some
thousand
a
year
at
the
outside
,
and
he
therefore
never
come
up
to
London
,
and
have
no
ambition
to
have
himself
number
as
one
in
any
exclusive
set
.
<EOS>
a
hot
-
headed
,
ignorant
,
honest
old
gentleman
,
he
live
ever
at
Vavasor
Hall
,
declare
to
any
who
would
listen
to
him
,
that
the
country
be
go
to
the
mischief
,
and
congratulate
himself
that
at
any
rate
,
in
his
county
,
parliamentary
reform
have
be
powerless
to
alter
the
old
political
arrangement
.
<EOS>
Alice
Vavasor
,
whose
offence
against
the
world
I
be
to
tell
you
,
and
if
possible
to
excuse
,
be
the
daughter
of
his
young
son
;
and
as
her
father
,
John
Vavasor
,
have
do
nothing
to
raise
the
family
name
to
eminence
,
Alice
could
not
lay
claim
to
any
high
position
from
her
birth
as
a
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
have
come
up
to
London
early
in
life
as
a
barrister
,
and
have
fail
.
<EOS>
He
have
fail
at
least
in
attain
either
much
wealth
or
much
repute
,
though
he
have
succeed
in
earning
,
or
perhaps
I
may
better
say
,
in
obtain
,
a
livelihood
.
<EOS>
He
have
marry
a
lady
somewhat
old
than
himself
,
who
be
in
possession
of
four
hundred
a
year
,
and
who
be
relate
to
those
big
people
to
whom
I
have
allude
.
<EOS>
who
these
be
and
the
special
nature
of
the
relationship
,
I
shall
be
call
upon
to
explain
hereafter
,
but
at
present
it
will
suffice
to
say
that
Alice
Macleod
give
great
offence
to
all
her
friend
by
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
,
however
,
give
them
much
time
for
the
indulgence
of
their
anger
.
<EOS>
have
give
birth
to
a
daughter
within
twelve
month
of
her
marriage
,
she
die
,
leave
in
abeyance
that
question
as
to
whether
the
fault
of
her
marriage
should
or
should
not
be
pardon
by
her
family
.
  
<EOS>
when
a
man
marry
an
heiress
for
her
money
,
if
that
money
be
within
her
own
control
,
as
be
the
case
with
Miss
Macleod
's
fortune
,
it
be
generally
well
for
the
speculating
lover
that
the
lady
's
friend
should
quarrel
with
him
and
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
thereby
drive
to
throw
herself
entirely
into
the
gentleman
's
arm
,
and
he
thus
become
possess
of
the
wife
and
the
money
without
the
abominable
nuisance
of
stringent
settlement
.
<EOS>
but
the
Macleods
,
though
they
quarrel
with
Alice
,
do
not
quarrel
with
her
_
<EOS>
à
l'outrance
_
.
<EOS>
They
snub
herself
and
her
choose
husband
;
but
they
do
not
so
far
separate
themselves
from
her
and
her
affair
as
to
give
up
the
charge
of
her
possession
.
<EOS>
Her
four
hundred
a
year
be
settle
very
closely
on
herself
and
on
her
child
,
without
even
a
life
interest
have
be
give
to
Mr.
Vavasor
,
and
therefore
when
she
die
the
mother
's
fortune
become
the
property
of
the
little
baby
.
<EOS>
but
,
under
these
circumstance
,
the
big
people
do
not
refuse
to
interest
themselves
to
some
extent
on
behalf
of
the
father
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
that
any
actual
agreement
or
compact
be
make
between
Mr.
Vavasor
and
the
macleod
;
but
it
come
to
be
understand
between
them
that
if
he
make
no
demand
upon
them
for
his
daughter
's
money
,
and
allow
them
to
have
charge
of
her
education
,
they
would
do
something
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
practise
barrister
,
though
his
practice
have
never
amount
to
much
;
and
a
practise
barrister
be
always
suppose
to
be
capable
of
fill
any
situation
which
may
come
his
way
.
<EOS>
two
year
after
his
wife
's
death
Mr.
Vavasor
be
appoint
assistant
commissioner
in
some
office
which
have
to
do
with
insolvent
,
and
which
be
abolish
three
year
after
his
appointment
.
<EOS>
It
be
at
first
thought
that
he
would
keep
his
eight
hundred
a
year
for
life
and
be
require
to
do
nothing
for
it
;
but
a
wretched
cheesepare
Whig
government
,
as
John
Vavasor
call
it
when
describe
the
circumstance
of
the
arrangement
to
his
father
,
down
in
Westmoreland
,
would
not
permit
this
;
it
give
him
the
option
of
take
four
hundred
a
year
for
do
nothing
,
or
of
keep
his
whole
income
and
attend
three
day
a
week
for
three
hour
a
day
during
term
time
,
at
a
miserable
dingy
little
office
near
Chancery
Lane
,
where
his
duty
would
consist
in
sign
his
name
to
account
which
he
never
read
,
and
at
which
he
be
never
suppose
even
to
look
.
<EOS>
He
have
sulkily
elect
to
keep
the
money
,
and
this
signing
have
be
now
for
nearly
twenty
year
the
business
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
consider
himself
to
be
a
very
hardly
-
use
man
.
<EOS>
one
Lord
Chancellor
after
another
he
petition
,
beg
that
he
may
be
relieve
from
the
cruelty
of
his
position
,
and
allow
to
take
his
salary
without
do
anything
in
return
for
it
.
<EOS>
the
amount
of
work
which
he
do
perform
be
certainly
a
minimum
of
labour
.
<EOS>
term
time
,
as
term
be
count
in
Mr.
Vavasor
's
office
,
hardly
comprise
half
the
year
,
and
the
hour
of
weekly
attendance
do
not
do
more
than
make
one
day
's
work
a
week
for
a
working
man
;
but
Mr.
Vavasor
have
be
appoint
an
assistant
commissioner
,
and
with
every
Lord
Chancellor
he
argue
that
all
Westminster
Hall
,
and
Lincoln
's
Inn
to
boot
,
have
no
right
to
call
upon
him
to
degrade
himself
by
sign
his
name
to
account
.
<EOS>
in
answer
to
every
memorial
he
be
offer
the
alternative
of
freedom
with
half
his
income
;
and
so
the
thing
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
there
can
,
however
,
be
no
doubt
that
Mr.
Vavasor
be
well
off
and
happier
with
his
almost
nominal
employment
than
he
would
have
be
without
it
.
<EOS>
He
always
argue
that
it
keep
him
in
London
;
but
he
would
undoubtedly
have
live
in
London
with
or
without
his
official
occupation
.
<EOS>
He
have
become
so
habituated
to
London
life
in
a
small
way
,
before
the
choice
of
leave
London
be
open
to
him
,
that
nothing
would
have
keep
him
long
away
from
it
.
<EOS>
after
his
wife
's
death
he
dine
at
his
club
every
day
on
which
a
dinner
be
not
give
to
him
by
some
friend
elsewhere
,
and
be
rarely
happy
except
when
so
dine
.
<EOS>
They
who
have
see
him
scan
the
steward
's
list
of
dish
,
and
give
the
necessary
order
for
his
own
and
his
friend
's
dinner
,
at
about
half
past
four
in
the
afternoon
,
have
see
John
Vavasor
at
the
only
moment
of
the
day
at
which
he
be
ever
much
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
all
other
thing
be
light
and
easy
to
him
,
 
to
be
take
easily
and
to
be
dismiss
easily
.
<EOS>
even
the
eating
of
the
dinner
call
forth
from
him
no
special
sign
of
energy
.
<EOS>
sometimes
a
frown
will
gather
on
his
brow
as
he
taste
the
first
half
glass
from
his
bottle
of
claret
;
but
as
a
rule
that
which
he
have
prepare
for
himself
with
so
much
elaborate
care
,
be
consume
with
only
pleasant
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
now
and
again
it
will
happen
that
the
cook
be
treacherous
even
to
him
,
and
then
he
can
hit
hard
;
but
in
hit
he
be
quiet
,
and
strike
with
a
smile
on
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
such
have
be
Mr.
Vavasor
's
pursuit
and
pleasure
in
life
up
to
the
time
at
which
my
story
commence
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
not
allow
the
reader
to
suppose
that
he
be
a
man
without
good
quality
.
<EOS>
have
he
when
young
possess
the
gift
of
industry
I
think
that
he
may
have
shine
in
his
profession
,
and
have
be
well
speak
of
and
esteem
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
he
be
a
discontented
man
,
but
nevertheless
he
be
popular
,
and
to
some
extent
esteem
.
<EOS>
He
be
liberal
as
far
as
his
mean
would
permit
;
he
be
a
man
of
his
word
;
and
he
understand
well
that
code
of
by
-
law
which
be
presume
to
constitute
the
character
of
a
gentleman
in
his
circle
.
<EOS>
He
know
how
to
carry
himself
well
among
man
,
and
understand
thoroughly
what
may
be
say
,
and
what
may
not
;
what
may
be
do
among
those
with
whom
he
live
,
and
what
should
be
leave
undone
.
<EOS>
by
nature
,
too
,
he
be
kindly
disposed
,
love
many
person
a
little
if
he
love
few
or
none
passionately
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
at
the
age
of
fifty
,
he
be
a
handsome
man
,
with
a
fine
forehead
,
round
which
the
hair
and
beard
be
only
begin
to
show
itself
to
be
grey
.
<EOS>
He
stand
well
,
with
a
large
person
,
only
now
begin
to
become
corpulent
.
<EOS>
His
eye
be
bright
and
grey
,
and
his
mouth
and
chin
be
sharply
cut
,
and
tell
of
gentle
birth
.
<EOS>
Most
man
who
know
John
Vavasor
well
,
declare
it
to
be
a
pity
that
he
should
spend
his
time
in
sign
account
in
Chancery
Lane
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
say
that
Alice
Vavasor
's
big
relative
care
but
little
for
her
in
her
early
year
;
but
I
have
also
say
that
they
be
careful
to
undertake
the
charge
of
her
education
,
and
I
must
explain
away
this
little
discrepancy
.
<EOS>
the
big
of
these
big
people
have
hardly
hear
of
her
;
but
there
be
a
certain
Lady
Macleod
,
not
very
big
herself
,
but
,
as
it
be
,
hang
on
to
the
skirt
of
those
who
be
so
,
who
care
very
much
for
Alice
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
widow
of
a
Sir
Archibald
Macleod
,
K.C.B.
,
who
have
be
a
soldier
,
she
herself
have
also
be
a
Macleod
by
birth
;
and
for
very
many
year
past
 
from
a
time
previous
to
the
birth
of
Alice
Vavasor
 
<EOS>
she
have
live
at
Cheltenham
,
make
short
sojourn
in
London
during
the
spring
,
when
the
content
of
her
limited
purse
would
admit
of
her
do
so
.
<EOS>
of
old
Lady
Macleod
I
think
I
may
say
that
she
be
a
good
woman
;
 
that
she
be
a
good
woman
,
though
subject
to
two
of
the
most
serious
drawback
to
goodness
which
can
afflict
a
lady
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
calvinistic
Sabbatarian
in
religion
,
and
in
worldly
matter
she
be
a
devout
believer
in
the
high
rank
of
her
noble
relative
.
<EOS>
She
could
almost
worship
a
youthful
marquis
,
though
he
live
a
life
that
would
disgrace
a
heathen
among
heathen
;
and
she
could
and
do
,
in
her
own
mind
,
condemn
crowd
of
commonplace
man
and
woman
to
all
eternal
torment
of
which
her
imagination
could
conceive
,
because
they
listen
to
profane
music
in
a
park
on
Sunday
.
<EOS>
yet
she
be
a
good
woman
.
<EOS>
out
of
her
small
mean
she
give
much
away
.
<EOS>
She
owe
no
man
anything
.
<EOS>
She
strove
to
love
her
neighbour
.
<EOS>
She
bear
much
pain
with
calm
unspeaking
endurance
,
and
she
live
in
trust
of
a
well
world
.
<EOS>
Alice
Vavasor
,
who
be
after
all
only
her
cousin
,
she
love
with
an
exceed
love
,
and
yet
Alice
have
do
very
much
to
extinguish
such
love
.
<EOS>
alice
,
in
the
year
of
her
childhood
,
have
be
bring
up
by
Lady
Macleod
;
at
the
age
of
twelve
she
have
be
send
to
a
school
at
Aix
-
la
-
Chapelle
,
 
a
comitatus
of
her
relative
have
agree
that
such
be
to
be
her
fate
,
much
in
opposition
to
Lady
Macleod
's
judgement
;
at
nineteen
she
have
return
to
Cheltenham
,
and
after
remain
there
for
little
more
than
a
year
,
have
express
her
unwillingness
to
remain
longer
with
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
She
could
sympathize
neither
with
her
relative
's
fault
or
virtue
.
<EOS>
She
make
an
arrangement
,
therefore
,
with
her
father
,
that
they
two
would
keep
house
together
in
London
,
and
so
they
have
live
for
the
last
five
year
;
 
for
Alice
Vavasor
when
she
will
be
introduce
to
the
reader
have
already
pass
her
twenty
-
fourth
birthday
.
  
<EOS>
Their
mode
of
life
have
be
singular
and
certainly
not
in
all
respect
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
alice
when
she
be
twenty
-
one
have
the
full
command
of
her
own
fortune
;
and
when
she
induce
her
father
,
who
for
the
last
fifteen
year
have
live
in
lodging
,
to
take
a
small
house
in
Queen
Anne
Street
,
of
course
she
offer
to
incur
a
portion
of
the
expense
.
<EOS>
He
have
warn
her
that
his
habit
be
not
those
of
a
domestic
man
,
but
he
have
be
content
simply
so
to
warn
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
feel
it
to
be
his
duty
to
decline
the
arrangement
because
he
know
himself
to
be
unable
to
give
to
his
child
all
that
attention
which
a
widow
father
under
such
circumstance
should
pay
to
an
only
daughter
.
<EOS>
the
house
have
be
take
,
and
Alice
and
he
have
live
together
,
but
their
life
have
be
quite
apart
.
<EOS>
for
a
short
time
,
for
a
month
or
two
,
he
have
strive
to
dine
at
home
and
even
to
remain
at
home
through
the
evening
;
but
the
work
have
be
too
hard
for
him
<EOS>
and
he
have
utterly
break
down
.
<EOS>
He
have
say
to
her
and
to
himself
that
his
health
would
fail
him
under
the
effect
of
so
great
a
change
make
so
late
in
life
,
and
I
be
not
sure
that
he
have
not
speak
truly
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
the
effort
have
be
abandon
,
and
Mr.
Vavasor
now
never
dine
at
home
.
<EOS>
nor
do
he
and
his
daughter
ever
dine
out
together
.
<EOS>
Their
joint
mean
do
not
admit
of
their
give
dinner
,
and
therefore
they
could
not
make
their
joint
way
in
the
same
circle
.
<EOS>
It
thus
come
to
pass
that
they
live
apart
,
 
quite
apart
.
<EOS>
They
see
each
other
,
probably
daily
;
but
they
do
little
more
than
see
each
other
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
even
breakfast
together
,
and
after
three
o'clock
in
the
day
Mr.
Vavasor
be
never
to
be
find
in
his
own
house
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Vavasor
have
make
for
herself
a
certain
footing
in
society
,
though
I
be
dispose
to
doubt
her
right
to
be
consider
as
hold
a
place
among
the
Upper
Ten
thousand
.
<EOS>
two
class
of
people
she
have
choose
to
avoid
,
have
be
drive
to
such
avoiding
by
her
aunt
's
preference
;
marquise
and
such
-
like
,
whether
wicked
or
otherwise
,
she
have
eschew
,
and
have
eschew
likewise
all
Low
Church
tendency
.
<EOS>
the
eschewing
of
marquise
be
not
generally
very
difficult
.
<EOS>
young
lady
live
with
their
father
on
very
moderate
income
in
or
about
Queen
Anne
Street
be
not
usually
much
troubled
on
that
matter
.
<EOS>
nor
can
I
say
that
Miss
Vavasor
be
so
troubled
.
<EOS>
but
with
her
there
be
a
certain
definite
thing
to
be
do
towards
such
eschewal
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
by
no
mean
avoid
her
noble
relative
,
nor
do
she
at
all
avoid
Alice
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
when
in
London
she
be
persevere
in
her
visit
to
Queen
Anne
Street
,
though
she
consider
herself
,
nobody
know
why
,
not
to
be
on
speak
term
with
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
and
she
strove
hard
to
produce
an
intimacy
between
Alice
and
her
noble
relative
 
such
an
intimacy
as
that
which
she
herself
enjoy
;
 
an
intimacy
which
give
her
a
footing
in
their
house
but
no
footing
in
their
heart
,
or
even
in
their
habit
.
<EOS>
but
all
this
Alice
decline
with
as
much
consistency
as
she
do
those
other
struggle
which
her
old
cousin
make
on
her
behalf
,
 
strong
,
never
-
flag
,
but
ever
-
fail
effort
to
induce
the
girl
to
go
to
such
place
of
worship
as
Lady
Macleod
herself
frequent
.
  
<EOS>
a
few
word
must
be
say
as
to
Alice
Vavasor
's
person
;
one
fact
also
must
be
tell
,
and
then
,
I
believe
,
I
may
start
upon
my
story
.
<EOS>
as
regard
her
character
,
I
will
leave
it
to
be
read
in
the
story
itself
.
<EOS>
the
reader
already
know
that
she
appear
upon
the
scene
at
no
very
early
age
,
and
the
mode
of
her
life
have
perhaps
give
to
her
an
appearance
of
more
year
than
those
which
she
really
possess
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
her
face
be
old
,
but
that
there
be
nothing
that
be
girlish
in
her
manner
.
<EOS>
Her
demeanour
be
as
staid
,
and
her
voice
as
self
-
possess
as
though
she
have
already
be
ten
year
marry
.
<EOS>
in
person
she
be
tall
and
well
make
,
rather
large
in
her
neck
and
shoulder
,
as
be
all
the
vavasor
,
but
by
no
means
fat
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
be
brown
,
but
very
dark
,
and
she
wear
it
rather
lower
upon
her
forehead
than
be
customary
at
the
present
day
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
,
too
,
be
dark
,
though
they
be
not
black
,
and
her
complexion
,
though
not
quite
that
of
a
brunette
,
be
far
away
from
be
fair
.
<EOS>
Her
nose
be
somewhat
broad
,
and
_
retroussé
_
too
,
but
to
my
thinking
it
be
a
charming
nose
,
full
of
character
,
and
give
to
her
face
at
time
a
look
of
pleasant
humour
,
which
it
would
otherwise
have
lack
.
<EOS>
Her
mouth
be
large
,
and
full
of
character
,
and
her
chin
oval
,
dimple
,
and
finely
chisel
,
like
her
father
's
.
<EOS>
I
beg
you
,
in
take
her
for
all
in
all
,
to
admit
that
she
be
a
fine
,
handsome
,
high
-
spirited
young
woman
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
for
my
fact
.
<EOS>
at
the
time
of
which
I
be
write
she
be
already
engage
to
be
marry
.
   
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
the
house
in
Queen
Anne
Street
be
a
pleasant
house
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
speak
of
the
material
house
,
make
up
of
the
wall
and
furniture
,
and
not
of
any
pleasantness
or
unpleasantness
supply
by
the
inmate
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
small
house
on
the
south
side
of
the
street
,
squeeze
in
between
two
large
mansion
which
seem
to
crush
it
,
and
by
which
its
fair
proportion
of
doorstep
and
area
be
in
truth
curtail
.
<EOS>
the
stair
be
narrow
;
the
dining
-
room
be
dark
,
and
possess
none
of
those
appearance
of
plenteous
hospitality
which
a
dining
-
room
should
have
.
<EOS>
but
all
this
would
have
be
as
nothing
if
the
drawing
-
room
have
be
pretty
as
it
be
the
bounden
duty
of
all
drawing
-
room
to
be
.
<EOS>
but
Alice
Vavasor
's
drawing
-
room
be
not
pretty
.
<EOS>
Her
father
have
have
the
care
of
furnish
the
house
,
and
he
have
intrust
the
duty
to
a
tradesman
who
have
choose
green
paper
,
a
green
carpet
,
green
curtain
,
and
green
damask
chair
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
green
damask
sofa
,
and
two
green
arm
-
chair
opposite
to
each
other
at
the
two
side
of
the
fireplace
.
<EOS>
the
room
be
altogether
green
,
and
be
not
enticing
.
<EOS>
in
shape
it
be
nearly
square
,
the
very
small
back
room
on
the
same
floor
not
have
be
,
as
be
usual
,
add
to
it
.
<EOS>
this
have
be
fit
up
as
a
"
study
"
for
Mr.
Vavasor
,
and
be
very
rarely
use
for
any
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
Most
of
us
know
when
we
enter
a
drawing
-
room
whether
it
be
a
pretty
room
or
no
;
but
how
few
of
us
know
how
to
make
a
drawing
-
room
pretty
!
<EOS>
there
have
come
up
in
London
in
these
latter
day
a
form
of
room
so
monstrously
ugly
that
I
will
venture
to
say
that
no
other
people
on
earth
but
Londoners
would
put
up
with
it
.
<EOS>
londoner
,
as
a
rule
,
take
their
house
as
they
can
get
them
,
look
only
to
situation
,
size
,
and
price
.
<EOS>
what
Grecian
,
<EOS>
what
Roman
,
<EOS>
what
Turk
,
what
Italian
would
endure
,
or
would
ever
have
endure
,
to
use
a
room
with
a
monstrous
cantle
in
the
form
of
a
parallelogram
cut
sheerly
out
of
one
corner
of
it
?
<EOS>
this
be
the
shape
of
room
we
have
now
adopt
,
 
or
rather
which
the
builder
have
adopt
for
us
,
 
in
order
to
throw
the
whole
first
floor
into
one
apartment
which
may
be
presume
to
have
noble
dimension
,
 
with
such
drawback
from
it
as
the
necessity
of
the
staircase
may
require
.
<EOS>
a
sharp
unadorned
corner
project
itself
into
these
would
-
be
noble
dimension
,
and
as
ugly
a
form
of
chamber
be
produce
as
any
upon
which
the
eye
can
look
.
<EOS>
I
would
say
more
on
the
subject
if
I
dare
to
do
so
here
,
but
I
be
bind
now
to
confine
myself
to
Miss
Vavasor
's
room
.
<EOS>
the
monstrous
deformity
of
which
I
have
speak
be
not
know
when
that
house
in
Queen
Anne
Street
be
build
.
<EOS>
there
be
to
be
find
no
such
abomination
of
shape
in
the
building
of
our
ancestor
,
 
not
even
in
the
day
of
George
the
Second
.
<EOS>
but
yet
the
drawing
-
room
of
which
I
speak
be
ugly
,
and
Alice
know
that
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
it
be
ugly
,
and
she
would
greatly
have
like
to
banish
the
green
sofa
,
to
have
re
-
paper
the
wall
,
and
to
have
hang
up
curtain
with
a
dash
of
pink
through
them
.
<EOS>
with
the
green
carpet
she
would
have
be
content
.
<EOS>
but
her
father
be
an
extravagant
man
;
and
from
the
day
on
which
she
have
come
of
age
she
have
determine
that
it
be
her
special
duty
to
avoid
extravagance
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
ugly
room
I
ever
see
in
my
life
,
"
her
father
once
say
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
very
pretty
,
"
Alice
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
half
with
you
in
the
expense
of
redo
it
,
"
say
Mr.
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
not
that
be
extravagant
,
papa
?
<EOS>
the
thing
have
not
be
here
quite
four
year
yet
.
"
  
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Vavasor
have
shrug
his
shoulder
and
say
nothing
more
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
little
to
him
whether
the
drawing
-
room
in
Queen
Anne
Street
be
ugly
or
pretty
.
<EOS>
He
be
on
the
committee
of
his
club
,
and
he
take
care
that
the
furniture
there
should
be
in
all
respect
comfortable
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
June
;
and
that
month
Lady
Macleod
be
in
the
habit
of
spend
among
her
noble
relative
in
London
when
she
have
succeed
in
make
both
end
so
far
overlap
each
other
at
Cheltenham
as
to
give
her
the
fifty
pound
necessary
for
this
purpose
.
<EOS>
for
though
she
spend
her
month
in
London
among
her
noble
friend
,
it
must
not
be
suppose
that
her
noble
friend
give
her
bed
or
board
.
<EOS>
They
sometimes
give
her
tea
,
such
as
it
be
,
and
once
or
twice
in
the
month
they
give
the
old
lady
a
second
-
rate
dinner
.
<EOS>
on
these
occasion
she
hire
a
little
parlour
and
bedroom
behind
it
in
King
Street
,
Saint
James
's
,
and
live
a
hot
,
uncomfortable
life
,
go
about
at
night
to
gathering
of
fashionable
people
of
which
she
in
her
heart
disapprove
,
seek
for
smile
which
seldom
come
to
her
,
and
which
she
excuse
herself
for
desire
because
they
be
the
smile
of
her
kith
and
her
kin
,
tell
herself
always
that
she
make
this
vain
journey
to
the
modern
Babylon
for
the
good
of
Alice
Vavasor
,
and
tell
herself
as
often
that
she
now
make
it
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
on
the
occasion
of
her
precede
visit
she
have
remind
herself
that
she
be
then
seventy
-
five
year
old
,
and
have
swear
to
herself
that
she
would
come
to
London
no
more
;
but
here
she
be
again
in
London
,
have
justify
the
journey
to
herself
on
the
plea
that
there
be
circumstance
in
Alice
's
engagement
which
make
it
desirable
that
she
should
for
a
while
be
near
her
niece
.
<EOS>
Her
niece
,
as
she
think
,
be
hardly
manage
her
own
affair
discreetly
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
aunt
,
"
say
Alice
,
as
the
old
lady
walk
into
the
drawing
-
room
one
morning
at
eleven
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Alice
always
call
Lady
Macleod
her
aunt
,
though
,
as
have
be
before
explain
,
there
be
no
such
close
connexion
between
them
.
<EOS>
during
Lady
Macleod
's
sojourn
in
London
these
morning
visit
be
make
almost
every
day
.
<EOS>
Alice
never
deny
herself
,
and
even
make
a
point
of
remain
at
home
to
receive
them
unless
she
have
previously
explain
that
she
would
be
out
;
but
I
be
not
prepared
to
say
that
they
be
,
of
their
own
nature
,
agreeable
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
mind
shut
the
window
,
my
dear
?
"
say
Lady
Macleod
,
seat
herself
stiffly
on
one
of
the
small
ugly
green
chair
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
educate
at
a
time
when
easy
-
chair
be
consider
vicious
,
and
among
people
who
regard
all
easy
posture
as
be
so
;
and
she
could
still
boast
,
at
seventy
-
six
,
that
she
never
lean
back
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Would
you
mind
shut
the
window

<EOS>
I
be
so
warm

I
be
afraid
of

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
mean
to

that
you
have
walk
from
King

say
Alice

do

she
be

"
indeed
I
do

every
step
of
the
way

<EOS>
cab
be
so
ruinous

<EOS>
It
be
a
most
unfortunate
thing
;
they
always
say
it
be
just
over
the
two
mile
here
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
a
word
of
it

because
I
be
only
a
little
more
than
the
half

hour
walk
it
;
and
those
man
will
say
anything
.
<EOS>
but
how
can
I
prove
it
,
you
know

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
really

it
be
too
far
for
you
to
walk
when
it
be
so
warm

<EOS>

but
what
can
I
do
,
my

<EOS>
I
must
come
,
when
I
have
specially
come
up
to
London
to
see
you

<EOS>
I
shall
have
a
cab
back
again
,
because
it
will
be
hot
then

and
dear
Lady
Midlothian
have
promise
to
send
her
carriage
at
three
to
take
me
to
the
concert

<EOS>
I
do
so
wish
you

Alice

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
out

the

without

It

the

My

I

I

but
neither

I
do
not

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
sort
of
people

not

to
call

if
you
will
think
of
it

how
could
they
do
it
with
all
the
demand
they
have
on
their
time

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My

I
would
not
interfere
with
their
time
for
world

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nobody
can
say
of
me
,
<EOS>
I
be
sure
,
that
I
run
after
great
people
or
rich
people
.
<EOS>
It
do
happen
that
some
of
the
near
relation
I
have
,
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
may
say
the
near
relation
,
 
be
people
of
high
rank
;
and
I
do
not
see
that
I
be
bind
to
turn
away
from
my
own
flesh
and
blood
because
of
that
,
particularly
when
they
be
always
so
anxious
to
keep
up
the
connexion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
only
speak
of
myself
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
different
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
know
them
all
your
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
how
be
you
to
know
them
if
you
will
not
begin
?
<EOS>
Lady
Midlothian
say
to
me
only
yesterday
that
she
be
glad
to
hear
that
you
be
go
to
be
marry
so
respectably
,
and
then
 
"
  
"
upon
my
word
I
be
very
much
oblige
to
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
she
consider
that
she
marry
respectably
when
she
take
Lord
Midlothian
?
"
  
<EOS>
now
Lady
Midlothian
have
be
unfortunate
in
her
marriage
,
have
unite
herself
to
a
man
of
bad
character
,
who
have
use
her
ill
,
and
from
whom
she
have
now
be
for
some
year
separate
.
<EOS>
Alice
may
have
spare
her
allusion
to
this
misfortune
when
speak
of
the
countess
to
the
cousin
who
be
so
fond
of
her
,
but
she
be
anger
by
the
application
of
that
odious
word
respectable
to
her
own
prospect
;
and
perhaps
the
more
angered
as
she
be
somewhat
inclined
to
feel
that
the
epithet
do
suit
her
own
position
.
<EOS>
Her
engagement
,
she
have
sometimes
tell
herself
,
be
very
respectable
,
and
have
as
often
tell
herself
that
it
lack
other
attraction
which
it
should
have
possess
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
quite
pleased
with
herself
in
have
accept
John
Grey
,
 
or
rather
perhaps
be
not
satisfied
with
herself
in
have
love
him
.
<EOS>
in
her
many
thought
on
the
subject
,
she
always
admit
to
herself
that
she
have
accept
him
simply
because
she
love
him
;
 
that
she
have
give
her
quick
assent
to
his
quick
proposal
simply
because
he
have
win
her
heart
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
sometimes
almost
angry
with
herself
that
she
have
permit
her
heart
to
be
thus
easily
take
from
her
,
and
have
rebuke
herself
for
her
girlish
facility
.
<EOS>
but
the
marriage
would
be
at
any
rate
respectable
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
be
a
man
of
high
character
,
of
good
though
moderate
mean
;
he
be
,
too
,
well
educated
,
of
good
birth
,
a
gentleman
,
and
a
man
of
talent
.
<EOS>
no
one
could
deny
that
the
marriage
would
be
highly
respectable
,
and
her
father
have
be
more
than
satisfied
.
<EOS>
why
Miss
Vavasor
herself
be
not
quite
satisfied
will
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
in
time
make
itself
appear
.
<EOS>
in
the
meanwhile
it
can
be
understand
that
Lady
Midlothian
's
praise
would
gall
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
do
not
be
uncharitable
,
"
say
Lady
Macleod
severely
.
<EOS>
"
whatever
may
have
be
Lady
Midlothian
's
misfortune
<EOS>
no
one
can
say
they
have
result
from
her
own
fault
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
they
can
,
aunt
,
if
she
marry
a
man
whom
she
know
to
be
a
scapegrace
because
he
be
very
rich
and
an
earl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
the
daughter
of
a
nobleman
herself
,
and
only
married
in
her
own
degree
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
want
to
discuss
that
.
<EOS>
She
mean
to
be
good
-
natured
when
she
mention
your
marriage
,
and
you
should
take
it
as
it
be
mean
.
<EOS>
after
all
she
be
only
your
mother
's
second
cousin
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
dear
aunt
,
I
make
no
claim
on
her
cousinship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
she
admit
the
claim
,
and
be
quite
anxious
that
you
should
know
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
at
the
trouble
to
find
out
everything
about
Mr.
Grey
,
and
tell
me
that
nothing
could
be
more
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
I
be
very
much
oblige
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
be
a
woman
of
much
patience
,
and
possess
also
of
considerable
perseverance
.
<EOS>
for
another
half
-
hour
she
go
on
expatiate
on
the
advantage
which
would
accrue
to
Alice
as
a
married
woman
from
an
acquaintance
with
her
noble
relative
,
and
endeavour
to
persuade
her
that
no
well
opportunity
than
the
present
would
present
itself
.
<EOS>
there
would
be
a
place
in
Lady
Midlothian
's
carriage
,
as
none
other
of
the
daughter
be
go
but
Lady
Jane
.
<EOS>
Lady
Midlothian
would
take
it
quite
as
a
compliment
,
and
a
concert
be
not
like
a
ball
or
any
customary
party
.
<EOS>
an
unmarried
girl
may
very
properly
go
to
a
concert
under
such
circumstance
as
now
exist
without
any
special
invitation
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
ought
to
have
know
her
adopted
niece
better
.
<EOS>
Alice
be
immoveable
.
<EOS>
as
a
matter
of
course
she
be
immoveable
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
have
seldom
be
able
to
persuade
her
to
anything
,
and
ought
to
have
be
well
sure
that
,
of
all
thing
,
she
could
not
have
persuade
her
to
this
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
at
last
,
they
come
to
another
subject
,
as
to
which
Lady
Macleod
declare
that
she
have
specially
come
on
this
special
morning
,
forgetting
,
probably
,
that
she
have
already
make
the
same
assertion
with
reference
to
the
concert
.
<EOS>
but
in
truth
the
last
assertion
be
the
correct
one
,
and
on
that
other
subject
she
have
be
hurry
on
to
say
more
than
she
mean
by
the
eagerness
of
the
moment
.
<EOS>
all
the
morning
she
have
be
full
of
the
matter
on
which
she
be
now
about
to
speak
.
<EOS>
She
have
discuss
it
quite
at
length
with
Lady
Midlothian
;
 
though
she
be
by
no
mean
prepared
to
tell
Alice
Vavasor
that
any
such
discussion
have
take
place
.
<EOS>
from
the
concert
,
and
the
effect
which
Lady
Midlothian
's
countenance
may
have
upon
Mr.
Grey
's
future
welfare
,
she
get
herself
by
degree
round
to
a
projected
swiss
tour
which
Alice
be
about
to
make
.
<EOS>
of
this
swiss
tour
she
have
hear
before
,
but
have
not
hear
who
be
to
be
Miss
Vavasor
's
companion
until
Lady
Midlothian
have
tell
her
.
<EOS>
how
it
have
come
to
pass
that
Lady
Midlothian
have
interest
herself
so
much
in
the
concern
of
a
person
whom
she
do
not
know
,
and
on
whom
she
in
her
greatness
could
not
be
expect
to
call
,
I
can
not
say
;
but
from
some
quarter
she
have
learn
who
be
the
propose
companion
of
Alice
Vavasor
's
tour
,
and
she
have
tell
Lady
Macleod
that
she
do
not
at
all
approve
of
the
arrangement
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
when
do
you
go
,
Alice
?
"
say
Lady
Macleod
.
  
<EOS>
"
early
in
July
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
very
hot
,
but
Kate
must
be
back
by
the
middle
of
August
.
"
<EOS>
Kate
Vavasor
be
Alice
's
first
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
<EOS>
Kate
be
to
go
with
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
she
be
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
go
alone
,
or
with
no
one
but
George
.
<EOS>
indeed
it
be
Kate
who
make
up
the
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
could
not
go
alone
with
George
,
"
say
Lady
Macleod
,
very
grimly
.
<EOS>
now
George
Vavasor
be
Kate
's
brother
,
and
be
therefore
also
first
cousin
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
He
be
heir
to
the
old
squire
down
in
Westmoreland
,
with
whom
Kate
live
,
their
father
be
dead
.
<EOS>
nothing
,
it
would
seem
,
could
be
more
rational
than
that
Alice
should
go
to
Switzerland
with
her
cousin
;
but
Lady
Macleod
be
clearly
not
of
this
opinion
;
she
look
very
grim
as
she
make
this
allusion
to
cousin
George
,
and
seem
to
be
prepare
herself
for
a
fight
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
exactly
what
I
say
,
"
answer
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
he
be
simply
go
as
an
escort
to
me
and
Kate
,
as
we
do
not
like
the
rôle
of
unprotected
female
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
good
-
natured
of
him
,
see
how
much
his
time
be
take
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
never
do
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
because
you
do
not
know
him
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
certainly
I
do
not
know
him
.
<EOS>
"
She
do
not
add
that
she
have
no
wish
to
know
Mr.
George
Vavasor
,
but
she
look
it
.
"
<EOS>
and
have
your
father
be
tell
that
he
be
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
he
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
 
"
Lady
Macleod
hesitate
a
little
before
she
go
on
,
and
then
finish
her
question
with
a
little
spasmodic
assumption
of
courage
.
"
<EOS>
and
do
Mr.
Grey
know
that
he
be
go
?
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
remain
silent
for
a
full
minute
before
she
answer
this
question
,
during
which
Lady
Macleod
sit
watch
her
grimly
,
with
her
eye
very
intent
upon
her
niece
's
face
.
<EOS>
if
she
suppose
such
silence
to
have
be
in
any
degree
produce
by
shame
in
answer
the
question
,
she
be
much
mistaken
.
<EOS>
but
it
may
be
doubt
whether
she
understand
the
character
of
the
girl
whom
she
think
she
know
so
well
,
and
it
be
probable
that
she
do
make
such
mistake
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
tell
you
simply
that
he
do
,
"
say
Alice
at
last
,
"
see
that
I
write
to
him
yesterday
,
let
him
know
that
such
be
our
arrangement
;
but
I
feel
that
I
should
not
thus
answer
the
question
you
mean
to
ask
.
<EOS>
You
want
to
know
whether
Mr.
Grey
will
approve
of
it
.
<EOS>
as
I
only
write
yesterday
of
course
I
have
not
hear
,
and
therefore
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
say
this
,
aunt
,
that
much
as
I
may
regret
his
disapproval
,
it
would
make
no
change
in
my
plan
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
it
not
?
<EOS>
then
I
must
tell
you
,
you
be
very
wrong
.
<EOS>
It
ought
to
make
a
change
.
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
the
disapproval
of
the
man
you
be
go
to
marry
make
no
change
in
your
plan
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
in
that
matter
.
<EOS>
come
,
aunt
,
if
we
must
discuss
this
matter
<EOS>
let
us
do
it
at
any
rate
fairly
.
<EOS>
in
an
ordinary
way
,
if
Mr.
Grey
have
ask
me
to
give
up
for
any
reason
my
trip
altogether
,
I
should
have
give
it
up
certainly
,
as
I
would
give
up
any
other
indifferent
project
at
the
request
of
so
dear
a
friend
,
 
a
friend
with
whom
I
be
<EOS>
so
 
so
 
so
closely
connected
.
<EOS>
but
if
he
ask
me
not
to
travel
with
my
cousin
George
,
I
should
refuse
him
absolutely
,
without
a
word
of
parley
on
the
subject
,
simply
because
of
the
nature
and
closeness
of
my
connection
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
understand
what
I
mean
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
do
.
<EOS>
You
mean
that
you
would
refuse
to
obey
him
on
the
very
subject
on
which
he
have
a
right
to
claim
your
obedience
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
no
right
to
claim
my
obedience
on
any
subject
,
"
say
Alice
;
and
as
she
speak
Aunt
Macleod
jump
up
with
a
little
start
at
the
vehemence
of
the
word
,
and
of
the
tone
in
which
they
be
express
.
<EOS>
She
have
hear
that
tone
before
,
and
may
have
be
use
to
it
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
the
little
jump
be
involuntary
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
present
he
have
no
right
to
my
obedience
on
any
subject
,
but
least
of
all
on
that
,
"
say
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
advice
he
may
give
me
,
but
I
be
quite
sure
he
will
not
ask
for
obedience
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
if
he
advise
you
you
will
slight
his
advice
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
if
he
tell
me
that
I
have
well
not
travel
with
my
cousin
George
I
shall
certainly
not
take
his
advice
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
I
should
be
careful
to
let
him
know
how
much
I
be
offend
by
any
such
counsel
from
him
.
<EOS>
It
would
show
a
littleness
on
his
part
,
and
a
suspicion
of
which
I
can
not
suppose
him
to
be
capable
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
,
as
she
say
this
,
get
up
from
her
seat
and
walk
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
finish
she
stand
at
one
of
the
window
with
her
back
to
her
visitor
.
<EOS>
there
be
silence
between
them
for
a
minute
or
two
,
during
which
Lady
Macleod
be
deeply
consider
how
best
she
may
speak
the
terrible
word
,
which
,
as
Alice
's
near
female
relative
,
she
feel
herself
bind
to
utter
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
collect
her
thought
and
her
courage
,
and
speak
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Alice
,
I
need
hardly
say
that
if
you
have
a
mother
live
,
or
any
person
with
you
fill
the
place
of
a
mother
,
I
should
not
interfere
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
Aunt
Macleod
,
if
you
think
I
be
wrong
you
have
quite
a
right
to
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
think
you
be
wrong
,
 
very
wrong
,
indeed
;
and
if
you
persist
in
this
I
be
afraid
I
must
say
that
I
shall
think
you
wicke

<EOS>
of
course
Mr.
Grey
can
not
like
you
to
travel
with
George
Vavasor

and
why
not
,

She
speak
with

upon

dear
aunt

you
must
excuse
me
if
I
say
that
I
can
not
discuss
George
Vavasor

mode
of
life
.
<EOS>
if
I

you
would
have
a
perfect
right
to
discuss
it

because
of
your

a
cousin

as
I

we
have
better
say
nothing
about
him

"
  
<EOS>

shake
her
head

<EOS>
She
do
not
like
to

anything
against
Mr.

before
his
daughter

but
the
shaking
of
her
head
be
intend
to
signify
that
Mr.

's
assent
in
such
a

be
worth
nothing

"
I
can
only
say
again

"
say
Lady
Macleod

that
I
think
Mr.
Grey
will
be
displeased
,
 
and
that
he
will
have
very
great
cause
for
displeasure

and
I
think
,
moreover
,
that
his
approbation
ought
to
be
your
chief
study

I
believe
,
my
dear
,
I
will
ask
you
to
let
Jane
get
me
a
cab
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
have
a
bit
too
much
time
to
dress
for
the
concert

"
  
<EOS>
Alice
simply
ring
the
bell
,
and
say
no
further
word
on
the
subject
which
they
have
be
discuss
.
<EOS>
when
Lady
Macleod
get
up
to
go
away
,
Alice
kiss
her
,
as
be
customary
with
them
,
and
the
old
lady
as
she
go
utter
her
customary
valediction
.
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you

my
dear

<EOS>
good
-
bye

<EOS>
I
will
come
to

morrow
if
I
can

"
there
be
therefore
no
quarrel
between
them
.
<EOS>
but
both
of
them
feel
that
word
have
be
speak
which
must
probably
lead
to
some
diminution
of
their
past
intimacy
.
  
<EOS>
when
Lady
Macleod
have
go
Alice
sit
alone
for
an
hour
thinking
of
what
have
pass
between
them
,
 
think
rather
of
those
two
man
,
the
worthy
man
and
the
wild
man
,
whose
name
have
be
mention
in
close
connection
with
herself
.
<EOS>
John
Grey
be
a
worthy
man
,
a
man
worthy
at
all
point
,
as
far
as
she
know
him
.
<EOS>
She
tell
herself
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
and
she
tell
herself
,
also
,
that
her
cousin
George
be
wild
,
 
very
wild
.
<EOS>
and
yet
her
thought
be
,
I
fear
,
on
the
whole
more
kindly
towards
her
cousin
than
towards
her
lover
.
<EOS>
She
have
declare
to
her
aunt
that
John
Grey
would
be
incapable
of
such
suspicion
as
would
be
show
by
any
objection
on
his
part
to
the
arrangement
make
for
the
tour
.
<EOS>
She
have
say
so
,
and
have
so
believe
;
and
yet
she
continue
to
brood
over
the
position
which
her
affair
would
take
,
if
he
do
make
the
objection
which
Lady
Macleod
anticipate
.
<EOS>
She
tell
herself
over
and
over
again
,
that
under
such
circumstance
she
would
not
give
way
an
inch
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
free
to
go
,
"
she
say
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
do
not
trust
me
he
be
quite
free
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
almost
be
say
that
she
come
at
last
to
anticipate
from
her
lover
that
very
answer
to
her
own
letter
which
she
have
declare
him
to
be
incapable
of
make
.
   
<EOS>
John
Grey
,
the
Worthy
Man
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
's
answer
to
Alice
Vavasor
's
letter
,
which
be
duly
send
by
return
of
post
and
duly
receive
on
the
morning
after
Lady
Macleod
's
visit
,
may
perhaps
be
take
as
give
a
sample
of
his
worthiness
.
<EOS>
It
be
date
from
Nethercoats
,
a
small
country
-
house
in
Cambridgeshire
which
belong
to
him
,
at
which
he
already
spend
much
of
his
time
,
and
at
which
he
intend
to
live
altogether
after
his
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
Nethercoats
,
June
,
186
 
.
  
<EOS>
dearest
alice
,
  
<EOS>
I
be
glad
you
have
settle
your
affair
,
 
foreign
affair
,
I
mean
,
 
so
much
to
your
mind
.
<EOS>
as
to
your
home
affair
they
be
not
,
to
my
thinking
,
quite
so
satisfactorily
arrange
.
<EOS>
but
as
I
be
a
party
interested
in
the
latter
<EOS>
my
opinion
may
perhaps
have
an
undue
bias
.
<EOS>
touch
the
tour
,
I
quite
agree
with
you
that
you
and
Kate
would
have
be
uncomfortable
alone
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
fine
theory
,
that
of
woman
be
able
to
get
along
without
man
as
well
as
with
them
;
but
,
like
other
fine
theory
,
it
will
be
find
very
troublesome
by
those
who
first
put
it
in
practice
.
<EOS>
gloved
hand
,
petticoat
,
feminine
softness
,
and
the
general
homage
pay
to
beauty
,
all
stand
in
the
way
of
success
.
<EOS>
these
thing
may
perhaps
some
day
be
get
rid
of
,
and
possibly
with
advantage
;
but
while
young
lady
be
still
encumber
with
them
a
male
companion
will
always
be
find
to
be
a
comfort
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
quite
know
whether
your
cousin
George
be
the
good
possible
knight
you
may
have
choose
.
<EOS>
I
should
consider
myself
to
be
infinitely
preferable
,
have
my
go
be
upon
the
card
.
<EOS>
be
you
in
danger
of
meet
Paynim
foe
,
he
,
no
doubt
,
would
kill
them
off
much
quicker
than
I
could
do
,
and
would
be
much
more
serviceable
in
liberate
you
from
the
dungeon
of
oppressor
,
or
even
from
stray
tiger
in
the
swiss
forest
.
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
his
be
punctual
with
the
luggage
.
<EOS>
He
will
want
you
or
Kate
to
keep
the
account
,
if
any
be
keep
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
slow
in
get
you
glass
of
water
at
the
railway
station
,
and
will
always
keep
you
wait
at
breakfast
.
<EOS>
I
hold
that
a
man
with
two
lady
on
a
tour
should
be
an
absolute
slave
to
them
,
or
they
will
not
fully
enjoy
themselves
.
<EOS>
He
should
simply
be
an
upper
servant
,
with
the
privilege
of
sit
at
the
same
table
with
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
I
have
my
doubt
as
to
whether
your
cousin
be
fit
for
the
place
;
but
,
as
to
myself
,
it
be
just
the
thing
that
I
be
make
for
.
<EOS>
luckily
,
however
,
neither
you
nor
Kate
be
without
will
of
your
own
,
and
perhaps
you
may
be
able
to
reduce
Mr.
Vavasor
to
obedience
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
home
affair
I
have
very
little
to
say
here
,
 
in
this
letter
.
<EOS>
I
shall
of
course
run
up
and
see
you
before
you
start
,
and
shall
probably
stay
a
week
in
town
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
ought
not
to
do
so
,
as
it
will
be
a
week
of
idleness
,
and
yet
not
a
week
of
happiness
.
<EOS>
I
would
sooner
have
an
hour
with
you
in
the
country
than
a
whole
day
in
London
.
<EOS>
and
I
always
feel
in
town
that
I
have
too
much
to
do
to
allow
of
my
do
anything
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
sheer
idleness
I
could
enjoy
it
,
but
it
be
a
feverish
idleness
,
in
which
one
be
drive
here
and
there
,
expect
some
gratification
which
not
only
never
come
,
but
which
never
even
begin
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
will
,
however
,
undergo
a
week
of
it
,
 
say
the
last
seven
day
of
this
month
,
and
shall
trust
to
you
to
recompense
me
by
as
much
of
yourself
as
your
town
doing
will
permit
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
again
as
to
those
home
affair
.
<EOS>
if
I
say
nothing
now
I
believe
you
will
understand
why
I
refrain
.
<EOS>
You
have
cunningly
just
leave
me
to
imply
,
from
what
you
say
,
that
all
my
argument
have
be
of
no
avail
;
but
you
do
not
answer
them
,
or
even
tell
me
that
you
have
decide
.
<EOS>
I
shall
therefore
imply
nothing
,
and
still
trust
to
my
personal
eloquence
for
success
.
<EOS>
or
rather
not
trust
,
 
not
trust
,
but
hope
.
  
<EOS>
the
garden
be
go
on
very
well
.
<EOS>
We
be
rather
short
of
water
,
and
therefore
not
quite
as
bright
as
I
have
hope
;
but
we
be
prepare
with
untire
industry
for
future
brightness
.
<EOS>
Your
command
have
be
obey
in
all
thing
,
and
Morrison
always
say
"
the
mistress
do
not
mean
this
,
"
or
"
the
mistress
do
intend
that
.
"
<EOS>
God
bless
the
mistress
be
what
I
now
say
,
and
send
her
home
,
to
her
own
home
,
to
her
flower
,
and
her
fruit
,
and
her
house
,
and
her
husband
,
as
soon
as
may
be
,
with
no
more
of
these
delay
which
be
to
me
so
grievous
,
and
which
seem
to
me
to
be
so
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
that
be
my
prayer
.
  
<EOS>
yours
ever
and
always
,

G.

"
I
do
not
give
command
,
"
Alice
say
to
herself
,
as
she
sit
with
the
letter
at
her
solitary
breakfast
-
table
.
"
<EOS>
He
ask
me
how
I
like
the
thing
,
and
of
course
I
be
oblige
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
seem
to
care
,
even
if
I
do
not
care
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
such
be
her
first
thought
as
she
put
the
letter
back
into
its
envelope
,
after
read
it
the
second
time
.
<EOS>
when
she
open
it
,
which
she
do
quickly
,
not
pause
a
moment
lest
she
should
suspect
herself
of
fear
to
see
what
may
be
its
content
,
her
mind
be
full
of
that
rebuke
which
her
aunt
have
anticipate
,
and
which
she
have
almost
teach
herself
to
expect
.
<EOS>
She
have
tear
the
letter
open
rapidly
,
and
have
dash
at
its
content
with
quick
eye
.
<EOS>
in
half
a
moment
she
have
see
what
be
the
nature
of
the
reply
respect
the
propose
companion
of
her
tour
,
and
then
she
have
complete
her
reading
slowly
enough
.
"
<EOS>
no
;
I
give
no
command
,
"
she
repeat
to
herself
,
as
though
she
may
thereby
absolve
herself
from
blame
in
reference
to
some
possible
future
accusation
,
which
may
perhaps
be
bring
against
her
under
certain
circumstance
which
she
be
contemplate
.
  
<EOS>
then
she
consider
the
letter
bit
by
bit
,
take
it
backwards
,
and
sip
her
tea
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
amidst
her
thought
.
<EOS>
no
;
she
have
no
home
,
no
house
,
there
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
husband
;
 
not
as
yet
.
<EOS>
He
speak
of
their
engagement
as
though
it
be
a
betrothal
,
as
betrothal
use
to
be
of
yore
;
as
though
they
be
already
in
some
sort
married
.
<EOS>
such
betrothal
be
not
make
now
-
a
-
day
.
<EOS>
there
still
remain
,
both
to
him
and
to
her
,
a
certain
liberty
of
extricate
themselves
from
this
engagement
.
<EOS>
Should
he
come
to
her
and
say
that
he
find
that
their
contemplate
marriage
would
not
make
him
happy
<EOS>
,
would
not
she
release
him
without
a
word
of
reproach
?
<EOS>
Would
not
she
regard
him
as
much
more
honourable
in
do
so
than
in
adhere
to
a
marriage
which
be
distasteful
to
him
?
<EOS>
and
if
she
would
so
judge
him
,
 
judge
him
and
certainly
acquit
him
,
<EOS>
be
it
not
reasonable
that
she
under
similar
circumstance
should
expect
a
similar
acquittal
?
<EOS>
then
she
declare
to
herself
that
she
carry
on
this
argument
within
her
own
breast
simply
as
an
argument
,
induce
to
do
so
by
that
assertion
on
his
part
that
he
be
already
her
husband
,
 
that
his
house
be
even
now
her
home
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
intention
of
use
that
power
which
be
still
hers
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
wish
to
go
back
from
her
pledged
word
.
<EOS>
She
think
that
she
have
no
such
wish
.
<EOS>
She
love
him
much
,
and
admire
him
even
more
than
she
love
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
noble
,
generous
,
clever
,
good
,
 
so
good
as
to
be
almost
perfect
;
nay
,
for
aught
she
know
he
be
perfect
.
<EOS>
Would
that
he
have
some
fault
!
<EOS>
Would
that
he
have
!
<EOS>
Would
that
he
have
!
<EOS>
how
could
she
,
full
of
fault
as
she
know
herself
to
be
,
 
how
could
she
hope
to
make
happy
a
man
perfect
as
he
be
!
<EOS>
but
then
there
would
be
no
doubt
as
to
her
present
duty
.
<EOS>
She
love
him
,
and
that
be
everything
.
<EOS>
have
tell
him
that
she
love
him
,
and
have
on
that
score
accept
his
love
,
nothing
but
a
change
in
her
heart
towards
him
could
justify
her
in
seek
to
break
the
bond
which
bind
them
together
.
<EOS>
She
do
love
him
,
and
she
love
him
only
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
have
once
love
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
yes
,
truly
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
in
her
thought
she
do
not
now
deny
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
love
him
,
and
be
torment
by
a
feeling
that
she
have
have
a
more
full
delight
in
that
love
than
in
this
other
that
have
spring
up
subsequently
.
<EOS>
She
have
tell
herself
that
this
have
come
of
her
youth
;
 
that
love
at
twenty
be
sweet
than
it
could
be
afterwards
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
something
of
rapture
in
that
early
dream
which
could
never
be
repeat
,
 
which
could
never
live
,
indeed
,
except
in
a
dream
.
<EOS>
now
,
now
that
she
be
old
and
perhaps
wise
,
love
mean
a
partnership
,
in
which
each
partner
would
be
honest
to
the
other
,
in
which
each
would
wish
and
strive
for
the
other
's
welfare
,
so
that
thus
their
joint
welfare
may
be
insure
.
<EOS>
then
,
in
those
early
girlish
day
,
it
have
mean
a
total
abnegation
of
self
.
<EOS>
the
one
be
of
earth
,
and
therefore
possible
.
<EOS>
the
other
have
be
a
ray
from
heaven
,
 
and
impossible
,
except
in
a
dream
.
  
<EOS>
and
she
have
be
mistake
in
her
first
love
.
<EOS>
She
admit
that
frankly
.
<EOS>
He
whom
she
have
worship
have
be
an
idol
of
clay
,
and
she
know
that
it
be
well
for
her
to
have
abandon
that
idolatry
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
only
be
untrue
to
her
,
but
,
bad
than
that
,
have
be
false
in
excuse
his
untruth
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
only
promise
falsely
,
but
have
make
such
promise
with
a
deliberate
,
premeditated
falsehood
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
be
selfish
,
coldly
selfish
,
weigh
the
value
of
his
own
low
lust
against
that
of
her
holy
love
.
<EOS>
She
have
know
this
,
and
have
part
from
him
with
an
oath
to
herself
that
no
promise
contrition
on
his
part
should
ever
bring
them
again
together
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
pardon
him
as
a
man
,
though
never
as
a
lover
,
and
have
bid
him
welcome
again
as
a
cousin
and
as
her
friend
's
brother
.
<EOS>
She
have
again
become
very
anxious
as
to
his
career
,
not
hide
her
regard
,
but
profess
that
anxiety
aloud
.
<EOS>
She
know
him
to
be
clever
,
ambitious
,
bold
,
 
and
<EOS>
she
believe
even
yet
,
in
spite
of
her
own
experience
,
that
he
may
not
be
bad
at
heart
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
she
tell
herself
that
in
truth
she
love
the
man
to
whom
her
troth
be
plight
,
I
fear
that
she
almost
think
more
of
that
other
man
from
whom
she
have
tear
herself
asunder
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
he
find
himself
unhappy
in
London
?
<EOS>
"
she
say
,
as
she
go
back
to
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
why
should
he
pretend
to
condemn
the
very
place
which
most
man
find
the
fit
for
all
their
energy
?
<EOS>
be
I
a
man
,
no
earthly
consideration
should
induce
me
to
live
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
It
be
odd
how
we
differ
in
all
thing
.
<EOS>
however
brilliant
may
be
his
own
light
,
he
would
be
content
to
hide
it
under
a
bushel
!
"
  
<EOS>
and
at
last
she
recur
to
that
matter
as
to
which
she
have
be
so
anxious
when
she
first
open
her
lover
's
letter
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
remember
how
assure
she
have
express
herself
that
Mr.
Grey
would
not
condescend
to
object
to
her
travel
with
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
so
condescend
.
<EOS>
He
have
write
on
the
matter
with
a
pleasant
joke
,
like
a
gentleman
as
he
be
,
disdain
to
allude
to
the
past
passage
in
the
life
of
her
whom
he
love
,
abstain
even
from
express
anything
that
may
be
take
as
a
permission
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
in
Alice
's
word
,
as
she
tell
him
of
their
propose
plan
,
a
something
that
have
betray
a
tremor
in
her
thought
.
<EOS>
She
have
studiously
strive
so
to
frame
her
phrase
that
her
tale
may
be
tell
as
any
other
simple
statement
,
 
as
though
there
have
be
no
tremble
in
her
mind
as
she
write
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
fail
,
and
she
know
that
she
have
fail
.
<EOS>
She
have
fail
;
and
he
have
read
all
her
effort
and
all
her
failure
.
<EOS>
She
be
quite
conscious
of
this
;
she
feel
it
thoroughly
;
and
she
know
that
he
be
noble
and
a
gentleman
to
the
last
drop
of
his
blood
.
<EOS>
and
yet
 
yet
 
yet
there
be
almost
a
feeling
of
disappointment
in
that
he
have
not
write
such
a
letter
as
Lady
Macleod
have
anticipate
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
next
week
Lady
Macleod
still
come
almost
daily
to
Queen
Anne
Street
,
but
nothing
further
be
say
between
her
and
Miss
Vavasor
as
to
the
swiss
tour
;
nor
be
any
question
ask
about
Mr.
Grey
's
opinion
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
the
old
lady
of
course
discover
that
there
be
no
quarrel
,
or
,
as
she
believe
,
any
probability
of
a
quarrel
;
and
with
that
she
be
oblige
to
be
content
.
<EOS>
nor
do
she
again
on
this
occasion
attempt
to
take
Alice
to
Lady
Midlothian
's
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
their
usual
subject
of
conversation
be
almost
abandon
,
and
Lady
Macleod
's
visit
,
though
they
be
as
constant
as
heretofore
,
be
not
so
long
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
dare
to
talk
about
Mr.
Grey
,
and
because
she
do
not
so
dare
,
be
determine
to
regard
herself
as
in
a
degree
ill
-
use
.
<EOS>
so
she
be
silent
,
reserved
,
and
fretful
.
<EOS>
at
length
come
the
last
day
of
her
London
season
,
and
her
last
visit
to
her
niece
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
come
because
it
be
my
last
day
,
"
say
Lady
Macleod
;
"
but
really
I
be
so
hurried
,
and
have
so
many
thing
to
do
,
that
I
hardly
know
how
to
manage
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
kind
,
"
say
Alice
,
give
her
aunt
an
affectionate
squeeze
of
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
keep
the
cab
,
so
I
can
just
stay
twenty
-
five
minute
.
<EOS>
I
have
mark
the
time
accurately
,
but
I
know
the
man
will
swear
it
be
over
the
half
-
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
have
no
more
trouble
about
cabs
,
aunt
,
when
you
be
back
in
Cheltenham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
fly
be
bad
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
I
really
think
they
be
bad
.
<EOS>
I
pay
the
bill
every
month
,
but
they
have
always
one
down
that
I
do
not
have
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
regular
practice
,
for
I
have
have
them
from
all
the
man
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
hard
enough
to
find
honest
man
anywhere
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
or
honest
woman
either
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
of
Mrs.
Green
want
to
charge
me
for
an
extra
week
,
because
she
say
I
do
not
give
her
notice
till
Tuesday
morning
?
<EOS>
I
will
not
pay
her
,
and
she
may
stop
my
thing
if
she
dare
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
come
up
to
London
again
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
aunt
,
do
not
say
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
say
it
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
what
should
an
old
woman
like
me
do
,
trail
up
to
town
every
year
,
merely
because
it
be
what
people
choose
to
call
the
season
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
to
see
your
friend
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
age
do
not
matter
when
a
person
's
health
be
so
good
as
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
know
what
I
suffer
from
lumbago
,
 
though
I
must
say
come
to
London
always
do
cure
that
for
the
time
.
<EOS>
but
as
for
friend
 
!
<EOS>
well
,
I
suppose
one
have
no
right
to
complain
when
one
get
to
be
as
old
as
I
be
;
but
I
declare
I
believe
that
those
I
love
best
would
sooner
be
without
me
than
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
me
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
my
dear
,
I
do
not
mean
you
.
<EOS>
of
course
my
life
would
have
be
very
different
if
you
could
have
consent
to
remain
with
me
till
you
be
married
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
mean
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
I
mean
any
one

<EOS>
You
should
not
mind
what
an
old
woman
like
me
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
be
a
little
melancholy
because
you
be
go
away
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
why
I
stay
the
last
week
.
<EOS>
I
do
say
to
Lady
Midlothian
that
I
think
I
should
go
on
the
20th
;
and
,
though
I
know
that
she
know
that
I
really
do
not
go
,
she
have
not
once
send
to
me
since
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
they
have
be
out
every
night
;
but
I
think
she
may
have
ask
me
to
come
and
lunch
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
very
lonely
dining
by
myself
in
lodging
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
yet
you
never
will
come
and
dine
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
my
dear
;
no
.
<EOS>
but
we
will
not
talk
about
that
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
one
word
more
to
say
.
<EOS>
let
me
see
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
six
minute
to
stay
.
<EOS>
I
have
make
up
my
mind
that
I
will
never
come
up
to
town
again
,
 
except
for
one
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
what
be
that
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
,
as
she
ask
the
question
,
well
know
what
that
one
thing
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
come
for
your
marriage
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
I
do
hope
you
will
not
keep
me
long
wait
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
make
any
promise
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
knowing
when
that
may
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
should
there
be
no
knowing
?
<EOS>
I
always
think
that
when
a
girl
be
once
engage
the
sooner
<EOS>
she
be
marry
the
well
.
<EOS>
there
may
be
reason
for
delay
on
the
gentleman
's
part

"
  
<EOS>
"
there
very
often
be
,
you
know
,
"
  
"
but
,
Alice
,
you
do
not
mean
to
say
that
Mr.
Grey
be
put
it
off
?
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
be
silent
for
a
moment
,
during
which
Lady
Macleod
's
face
assume
a
look
of
almost
tragic
horror
.
<EOS>
be
there
something
wrong
on
Mr.
Grey
's
side
of
which
she
be
altogether
unaware
?
<EOS>
Alice
,
though
for
a
second
or
two
she
have
be
guilty
of
a
slight
playful
deceit
,
be
too
honest
to
allow
the
impression
to
remain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
aunt

she
say
;
"
Mr.
Grey
be
not
put
it
off

It
have
be
leave
to
me
to
fix
the
time

"
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
do
not
you
fix
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
such
a
serious
thing
!
<EOS>
after
all
it
be
not
more
than
four
month
yet
since
I
 
I
accept
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
there
have
be
any
delay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"

you
may
fix
the
time
now
,
if
he
wish
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
perhaps
I
shall
,
 
some
day
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
think
about
it
,
and
you
must
not
drive
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
should
have
some
one
to
advise
you
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
that
be
just
it
.
<EOS>
People
always
do
seem
to
think
it
so
terrible
that
a
girl
should
have
her
own
way
in
anything
.
<EOS>
She
must
not
like
any
one
at
first
;
and
then
,
when
she
do
like
some
one
,
she
must
marry
him
directly
<EOS>
she
be
bidden
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
much
of
my
own
way
at
present
;
but
you
see
,
when
I
be
married
I
shall
not
have
it
at
all
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
wonder
that
I
should
not
be
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
advocate
anything
like
hurry
,
my
dear

but
,
goodness
gracious
me
!
<EOS>
I
have
be
here
twenty
-
eight
minute
,
and
that
horrid
man
will
impose
upon
me
.
<EOS>
good
-
bye
<EOS>
;
God
bless
you
!
<EOS>
mind
you
write

"
<EOS>
and
Lady
Macleod
hurry
out
of
the
room
more
intent
at
the
present
moment
upon
save
her
sixpence
than
she
be
on
any
other
matter
whatsoever
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
John
Grey
come
up
to
town
,
arrive
a
day
or
two
after
the
time
that
he
have
fix
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
,
perhaps
,
improbable
that
Alice
have
use
some
diplomatic
skill
in
prevent
a
meeting
between
Lady
Macleod
and
her
lover
.
<EOS>
They
both
be
very
anxious
to
obtain
the
same
object
,
and
Alice
be
to
some

Lady
Macleod

John
Grey
put
their
force
together
<EOS>
she
may
have
find
herself
unable
to
resist
their
joint
endeavour

She
be
resolve
that
she
would
not
at
any
rate
name
any
day
for
her
marriage
before
her
return
from
Switzerland
;
and
she
may
therefore
have
think
it
wise
to
keep
Mr.
Grey
in
the
country
till
after
Lady
Macleod
have
go
,
even
though
she
thereby
cut
down
the
time
of
his
sojourn
in
London
to
four
day

<EOS>
on
the
occasion
of
that
visit
Mr.
Vavasor
do

memorable
thing

He
dine
at
home
with

welcome
his

son

<EOS>
He
dine
at
home

and
ask
,
or
rather
assented
to
Alice
's
asking
,
George
and
Kate
Vavasor
to
join
the
dinner

<EOS>
"
what
an
auspicious

the

nuptial

Kate

with
her
little
sarcastic
smile

"
<EOS>
Uncle
John
dine
at
home
,
and
Mr.
Grey
join
in
the
dissipation
of
a
dinner
-
party
.
<EOS>
We
shall
all
be
change
soon
,
I
suppose
,
and
George
and
I
will
take
to
keep
a
little
cottage
in
the
country

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Kate

"

Alice
,
angrily
,
"
I
think
you
be
about
the
most
unjust
person
I
ever
meet
.
<EOS>
I
would
forgive
your
raillery
,
however
painful
it
may
be
,
if
it
be
only
fair
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
to
whom
be
it
unfair
on
the
present
occasion
;
 
to
your
father
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
intend
for
him

"
  
<EOS>
"
to
yourself

<EOS>
"
I
care
nothing
as
to
myself
;
you
know
that
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
it
must
have
be
unfair
to
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
;
it
be
Mr.
Grey
whom
you
mean
to
attack
.
<EOS>
if
I
can
forgive
him
for
not
care
for
society
,
surely
you
may
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
exactly
;
<EOS>
but
that
be
just
what
you
can
not
do
,
<EOS>
my
dear
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
forgive
him
.
<EOS>
if
you
do
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
I
should
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
and
if
you
choose
to
bid
me
hold
my
tongue
I
will
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
but
when
you
tell
me
all
your
own
thought
about
this
thing
you
can
hardly
expect
but
that
I
should
let
you
know
mine
in
return
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
particular
;
and
if
you
be
ready
for
a
little
good
,
wholesome
,
useful
hypocrisy
,
I
will
not
balk
you
.
<EOS>
I
may
not
be
quite
so
dishonest
as
you
call
me
,
but
I
be
not
so
wed
to
truth
<EOS>
but
what
I
can
look
,
and
act
,
and
speak
a
few
falsehood
if
you
wish
it

<EOS>
only
let
us
understand
each

<EOS>
"
You
know
I
wish
for
no
falsehood

Kate

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
be
very
hard
to
understand
what
you
do

<EOS>
I
know
that
for
the
last
year
or
two
I
have
be
try
to
find
out
your
wish

and
,
upon
my
word
,
my
success
have
be
very
indifferent
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
wish
to
marry
Mr.
Grey
,
but
I
be
by
no
means
certain
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
last
thing
on
earth
you
would
wish
would
be
to
marry
George
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
very
last
.
<EOS>
You
be
right
there
at
any
rate

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
 
!
<EOS>
sometimes
you
drive
me
too
hard
;
you
do
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
You
make
me
doubt
whether
I
hate
or
love
you
most

<EOS>
know
what
my
feeling
be
about
George
,
I
can
not
understand
how
you
can
bring
yourself
to
speak
of
him
to
me
with
such
contempt

"
<EOS>
Kate
Vavasor
,
as
she
speak
these
word
,
leave
the
room
with
a
quick
step
,
and
hurry
up
to
her
own
chamber
.
<EOS>
there
Alice
find
her
in
tear
,
and
be
drive
by
her
friend
's
real
grief
into
the
expression
of
an
apology
,
which
she
know
be
not
properly
due
from
her
.
<EOS>
Kate
be
acquaint
with
all
the
circumstance
of
that
old
affair
between
her
brother
and
Alice
.
<EOS>
She
have
give
in
her
adhesion
to
the
propriety
of
what
Alice
have
do
.
<EOS>
She
have
allow
that
her
brother
George
's
behaviour
have
be
such
as
to
make
any
engagement
between
them
impossible
.
<EOS>
the
fault
,
therefore
,
have
be
her
in
make
any
reference
to
the
question
of
such
a
marriage
.
<EOS>
nor
have
it
be
by
any
mean
her
first
fault
of
the
same
kind
.
<EOS>
till
Alice
have
become
engage
to
Mr.
Grey
<EOS>
she
have
speak
of
George
only
as
her
brother
,
or
as
her
friend
's
cousin
,
but
now
she
be
constantly
make
allusion
to
those
past
occurrence
,
which
all
of
them
should
have
strive
to
forget
.
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
be
not
Lady
Macleod
right
in
say
that
George
Vavasor
should
not
have
be
accept
as
a
companion
for
the
swiss
tour
?
  
<EOS>
the
little
dinner
-
party
go
off
very
quietly
;
and
if
no
other
ground
exist
for
charge
Mr.
Grey
with
London
dissipation
than
what
that
afford
,
he
be
accuse
most
unjustly
.
<EOS>
the
two
young
man
have
never
before
meet
each
other
;
and
Vavasor
have
go
to
his
uncle
's
house
,
prepare
not
only
to
dislike
but
to
despise
his
successor
in
Alice
's
favour
.
<EOS>
but
in
this
he
be
either
disappointed
or
gratify
,
as
the
case
may
be
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
plenty
to
say
for
himself
,
"
he
say
to
Kate
on
his
way
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
;
he
can
talk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
he
do
not
talk
like
a
prig
either
,
which
be
what
I
expect
.
<EOS>
He
be
uncommonly
handsome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
man
never
see
that
in
each
other
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
it
in
any
man

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
in
every
animal
 
in
man

woman

horse
,
dog
,

even
pig
.
<EOS>
I
like
to
look
on
handsome
thing

I
think
people
always
do
who
be
ugly
themselves
.

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
you
be
go
into
rapture
in
favour
of
John
Grey

"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
be
not
.
<EOS>
I
very
seldom
go
into
rapture
about
anything
.
<EOS>
but
he
talk
in
the
way
I
like
a
man
to
talk
.
<EOS>
how
he
bowl
my
uncle
over
about
those
actor
;
and
yet
if
my
uncle
know
anything
about
anything
it
be
about
the
stage
twenty
year
ago
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
more
say
then
about
John
Grey
;
but
Kate
understand
her
brother
well
enough
to
be
aware
that
this
praise
mean
very
little
.
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
speak
sometimes
from
his
heart
,
and
do
so
more
frequently
to
his
sister
than
to
any
one
else
;
but
his
word
come
generally
from
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
day
after
the
little
dinner
in
Queen
Anne
Street
,
John
Grey
come
to
say
good
-
bye
to
his
betrothed
;
 
for
his
betroth
<EOS>
she
certainly
be
,
in
spite
of
those
very
poor
argument
which
she
have
use
in
try
to
convince
herself
that
she
be
still
free
if
she
wish
to
claim
her
freedom
.
<EOS>
though
he
have
be
constantly
with
Alice
during
the
last
three
day
,
he
have
not
hitherto
say
anything
as
to
the
day
of
their
marriage
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
constantly
with
her
alone
,
sit
for
hour
in
that
ugly
green
drawing
-
room
,
but
he
have
never
touch
the
subject
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
her
much
of
Switzerland
,
which
she
have
never
yet
see
but
which
he
know
well
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
her
much
of
his
garden
and
house
,
whither
<EOS>
she
have
once
go
with
her
father
,
whilst
pay
a
visit
nominally
to
the
college
at
Cambridge
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
talk
of
various
matter
,
matter
bear
in
no
immediate
way
upon
his
own
or
her
affair
;
for
Mr.
Grey
be
a
man
who
know
well
how
to
make
word
pleasant
;
but
previous
to
this
last
moment
he
have
say
nothing
on
that
subject
on
which
he
be
so
intent
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Alice
,
"
he
say
,
when
the
last
hour
have
come
,
"
and
about
that
question
of
home
affair
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
us
finish
off
the
foreign
affair
first

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

you
have
not

but
we
have
have
the
discussion
.

be
there
any
reason

this
thing
settle
.

<EOS>
"
no
;
no
special
reason

"
  
<EOS>
"
then
why
not

it
be
fix
?
<EOS>
do
you
fear
come

<EOS>
"
no

I
can
not

no

I
do

I
love
you
too
entirely
for
that

"
<EOS>
My

<EOS>
and
now
he
pass
his
arm
round
her
waist
as
they
stand
near
the
empty
fireplace
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
if
you
love
me
 
"
  
"
I
do
love
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
why
should
you
not

to
come
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
wish
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
wish
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Alice
,
you
must
have
wish
it
altogether
when
you
consent
to
be
my
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
person
may
wish
for
a
thing
altogether
,

yet
not

for
it

"
instantly
!
<EOS>
come
;
I
have
not
be
hard
on
you

<EOS>
this
be
still
June

<EOS>
Will
you
say
the
middle
of
September
,
and
we
shall
still
be
in
time
for
warm
pleasant
day
among
the
lake
?
<EOS>
be
that
ask
for
too
much
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
ask
for
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
but
it
be
,
love
.
<EOS>
grant
it
,
and
I
will
swear
that
you
have
grant
me
everything
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
silent
,
have
thing
to
say
but
not
know
in
what
word
to
put
them
.
<EOS>
now
that
he
be
with
her
she
could
not
say
the
thing
which
she
have
tell
herself
that
she
would
utter
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
hint
to
him
that
his
view
of
life
be
so
unlike
her
own
,
that
there
could
be
no
chance
of
happiness
between
them
,
unless
each
could
strive
to
lean
somewhat
towards
the
other
.
<EOS>
no
man
could
be
more
gracious
in
word
and
manner
than
John
Grey
;
no
man
more
chivalrous
in
his
carriage
towards
a
woman
;
but
he
always
speak
and
act
as
though
there
could
be
no
question
that
his
manner
of
life
be
to
be
adopt
,
without
a
word
or
thought
of
doubt
,
by
his
wife
.
<EOS>
when
two
come
together
,
why
should
not
each
yield
something
,
and
each
claim
something
?
<EOS>
this
she
have
mean
to
say
to
him
on
this
day
;
but
now
that
he
be
with
her
she
could
not
say
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
John
,
"
she
say
at
last
,
"
do
not
press
me
about
this
till
I
return
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
then
you
will
say
the
time
be
short
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
short
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
answer
you
now
;
 
indeed
,
I
can
not

<EOS>
that
be
I
can
not
answer
in
the
affirmative

<EOS>
It
be
such
a
solemn
thing

"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
it
ever
be
less
solemn
,
dear

"
  
"
never
,
I
hope
never
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
press
her
further
then
,
but
kiss
her
and
bade
her
farewell
.
   
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
,
the
Wild
Man
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
no
doubt
be
understand
that
George
Vavasor
do
not
roam
about
in
the
wood
unshorn
,
or
wear
leathern
trapping
and
sandal
,
like
Robinson
Crusoe
,
instead
of
coat
and
trouser
.
<EOS>
His
wildness
be
of
another
kind
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
do
not
know
that
he
be
in
truth
at
all
wild
,
though
Lady
Macleod
have
call
him
so
,
and
Alice
have
assent
to
her
use
of
the
word
.
  
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
have
live
in
London
since
he
be
twenty
,
and
now
,
at
the
time
of
the
beginning
of
my
story
,
he
be
a
year
or
two
over
thirty
.
<EOS>
He
be
and
ever
have
be
the
heir
to
his
grandfather
's
estate
;
but
that
estate
be
small
,
and
when
George
first
come
to
London
his
father
be
a
strong
man
of
forty
,
with
as
much
promise
of
life
in
him
as
his
son
have
.
<EOS>
a
profession
have
therefore
be
absolutely
necessary
to
him
;
and
he
have
,
at
his
uncle
<EOS>
John
's
instance
,
be
place
in
the
office
of
a
parliamentary
land
agent
.
<EOS>
with
this
parliamentary
land
agent
he
have
quarrel
to
the
knife
,
but
not
before
he
have
by
his
talent
make
himself
so
useful
that
he
have
before
him
the
prospect
of
a
lucrative
partnership
in
the
business
.
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
have
many
fault
,
but
idleness
 
absolute
idleness
 
be
not
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
He
would
occasionally
postpone
his
work
to
pleasure
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
at
Newmarket
when
he
should
have
be
at
Whitehall
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
usual
with
him
to
be
in
bed
when
he
should
be
at
his
desk
,
and
when
he
be
at
his
desk
he
do
not
whittle
his
ruler
,
or
pick
his
tooth
,
or
clip
his
nail
.
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
his
friend
be
pleased
with
the
first
five
year
of
his
life
in
London
 
in
spite
of
his
have
be
find
to
be
in
debt
on
more
than
one
occasion
.
<EOS>
but
his
debt
have
be
pay
;
and
all
be
go
on
swimmingly
,
when
one
day
he
knock
down
the
parliamentary
agent
with
a
blow
between
the
eye
,
and
then
there
be
an
end
of
that
.
<EOS>
He
himself
be
will
not
to
say
that
he
have
know
very
well
what
he
be
about
,
that
it
have
behove
him
to
knock
down
the
man
who
be
to
have
be
his
partner
,
and
that
he
regret
nothing
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
the
deed
be
look
upon
with
approve
eye
by
many
man
of
good
standing
,
 
or
,
at
any
rate
,
sufficient
standing
to
help
George
to
another
position
;
and
within
six
week
of
the
time
of
his
leave
the
office
at
Whitehall
,
he
have
become
a
partner
in
an
establish
firm
of
wine
merchant
.
<EOS>
a
great
-
aunt
have
just
then
leave
him
a
couple
of
thousand
pound
,
which
no
doubt
assist
him
in
his
view
with
the
wine
merchant
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
employment
he
remain
for
another
period
of
five
year
,
and
be
suppose
by
all
his
friend
to
be
do
very
well
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
he
do
not
do
badly
,
only
that
he
do
not
do
well
enough
to
satisfy
himself
.
<EOS>
He
be
ambitious
of
make
the
house
to
which
he
belong
the
first
house
in
the
trade
in
London
,
and
scare
his
partner
by
the
boldness
and
extent
of
his
view
.
<EOS>
He
himself
declare
that
if
they
would
only
have
go
along
with
him
he
would
have
make
them
prince
in
the
wine
market
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
man
either
of
more
prudence
or
of
less
audacity
than
he
,
and
they
decline
to
walk
in
his
course
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
the
five
year
Vavasor
leave
the
house
,
not
have
knock
any
one
down
on
this
occasion
,
and
take
with
him
a
very
nice
sum
of
money
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
last
of
these
five
year
have
certainly
be
the
good
period
of
his
life
,
for
he
have
really
work
very
hard
,
like
a
man
,
give
up
all
pleasure
that
take
time
from
him
,
 
and
give
up
also
most
pleasure
which
be
dangerous
on
account
of
their
costliness
.
<EOS>
He
go
to
no
race
,
play
no
billiard
,
and
speak
of
Cremorne
as
a
childish
thing
,
which
he
have
abandon
now
that
he
be
no
longer
a
child
.
<EOS>
It
be
during
these
two
year
that
he
have
have
his
love
passage
with
his
cousin
;
and
it
must
be
presume
that
he
have
,
at
any
rate
,
intend
at
one
time
to
settle
himself
respectably
as
a
married
man
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
however
,
behave
very
badly
to
Alice
,
and
the
match
have
be
break
off
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
also
during
the
last
two
year
quarrel
with
his
grandfather
.
<EOS>
He
have
wish
to
raise
a
sum
of
money
on
the
Vavasor
estate
,
which
,
as
it
be
unentaile
,
he
could
only
do
with
his
grandfather
's
concurrence
.
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
would
not
hear
of
it
,
 
would
listen
with
no
patience
to
the
proposition
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
that
George
attempt
to
make
the
squire
understand
that
the
wine
business
be
go
on
very
well
,
that
he
himself
owe
no
man
anything
,
that
everything
with
him
be
flourish
;
 
but
that
his
trade
may
be
extend
indefinitely
by
the
use
of
a
few
thousand
pound
at
moderate
interest
.
<EOS>
Old
Mr.
Vavasor
be
furious
.
<EOS>
no
document
and
no
assurance
could
make
him
lay
aside
a
belief
that
the
wine
merchant
,
and
the
business
,
and
his
grandson
be
all
ruin
and
ruinous
together
.
<EOS>
no
one
but
a
ruin
man
would
attempt
to
raise
money
on
the
family
estate
!
<EOS>
so
they
have
quarrel
,
and
have
never
speak
or
see
each
other
since
.
"
<EOS>
He
shall
have
the
estate
for
his
life
,
"
the
squire
say
to
his
son
John
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
I
have
a
right
to
leave
it
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
It
never
have
be
leave
away
from
the
heir
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
tie
it
up
so
that
he
shall
not
cut
a
tree
on
it
.
"
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
perhaps
think
that
the
old
rule
of
primogeniture
may
under
such
circumstance
have
be
judiciously
abandon
 
in
this
one
instance
,
in
his
own
favour
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
say
so
.
<EOS>
nor
would
he
have
say
it
have
there
be
a
chance
of
his
do
so
with
success
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
from
whom
no
very
noble
deed
could
be
expect
;
but
he
be
also
one
who
would
do
no
ignoble
deed
.
  
<EOS>
after
that
George
Vavasor
have
become
a
stockbroker
,
and
a
stockbroker
he
be
now
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
twelve
month
after
his
leave
the
wine
business
,
 
the
same
be
the
first
year
after
his
breach
with
Alice
,
 
he
have
go
back
greatly
in
the
estimation
of
man
.
<EOS>
He
have
live
in
open
defiance
of
decency
.
<EOS>
He
have
spend
much
money
and
have
apparently
make
none
,
and
have
be
,
as
all
his
friend
declare
,
on
the
high
road
to
ruin
.
<EOS>
Aunt
Macleod
have
take
her
judgement
from
this
period
of
his
life
when
she
have
speak
of
him
as
a
man
who
never
do
anything
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
come
forth
again
suddenly
as
a
working
man
;
and
now
they
who
profess
to
know
,
declare
that
he
be
by
no
means
poor
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
the
City
every
day
;
and
during
the
last
two
year
have
earn
the
character
of
a
shrewd
fellow
who
know
what
he
be
about
,
who
may
not
perhaps
be
very
mealy
-
mouthed
in
affair
of
business
,
but
who
be
fairly
and
decently
honourable
in
his
money
transaction
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
he
stand
well
on
"
change
.
  
<EOS>
and
during
these
two
year
he
have
stand
a
contest
for
a
seat
in
Parliament
,
have
strive
to
represent
the
metropolitan
borough
of
Chelsea
,
on
the
extremely
radical
interest
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
he
have
fail
,
and
that
he
have
spend
a
considerable
sum
of
money
in
the
contest
.
<EOS>
"
where
on
earth
do
your
nephew
get
his
money
?
<EOS>
"
man
say
to
John
Vavasor
at
his
club
.
"
<EOS>
upon
my
word
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
He
do
not
get
it
from
me
,
and
I
be
sure
he
do
not
get
it
from
my
father
.
"
<EOS>
but
George
Vavasor
,
though
he
fail
at
Chelsea
,
do
not
spend
his
money
altogether
fruitlessly
.
<EOS>
He
gain
reputation
by
the
struggle
,
and
man
come
to
speak
of
him
as
though
he
be
one
who
would
do
something
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
stockbroker
,
a
thorough
-
go
Radical
,
and
yet
he
be
the
heir
to
a
fine
estate
,
which
have
come
down
from
father
to
son
for
four
hundred
year
!
<EOS>
there
be
something
captivate
about
his
history
and
adventure
,
especially
as
just
at
the
time
of
the
election
he
become
engaged
to
an
heiress
,
who
die
a
month
before
the
marriage
should
have
take
place
.
<EOS>
She
die
without
a
will
,
and
her
money
all
go
to
some
third
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
bear
this
last
disappointment
like
a
man
,
and
it
be
at
this
time
that
he
again
become
fully
reconcile
to
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
previous
to
this
they
have
meet
;
and
Alice
,
at
her
cousin
<EOS>
Kate
's
instigation
,
have
induce
her
father
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
but
at
first
there
have
be
no
renewal
of
real
friendship
.
<EOS>
Alice
have
give
her
cordial
assent
to
her
cousin
's
marriage
with
the
heiress
,
Miss
Grant
,
tell
Kate
that
such
an
engagement
be
the
very
thing
to
put
him
thoroughly
on
his
foot
.
<EOS>
and
then
she
have
be
much
pleased
by
his
spirit
at
that
Chelsea
election
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
grand
of
him
,
be
not
it
?
"
say
Kate
,
her
eye
brim
full
of
tear
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
spirited
,
"
say
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
know
all
,
you
would
say
so
.
<EOS>
They
could
get
no
one
else
to
stand
but
that
Mr.
Travers
,
and
he
would
not
come
forward
,
unless
they
would
guarantee
all
his
expense
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
do
not
cost
George
much
,
"
say
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
It
do
,
though
;
nearly
all
he
have
get
.
<EOS>
but
what
matter
?
<EOS>
money
's
nothing
to
him
,
except
for
its
use
.
<EOS>
My
own
little
mite
be
my
own
now
,
and
he
shall
have
every
farthing
of
it
for
the
next
election
,
even
though
I
should
go
out
as
a
housemaid
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
"
there
must
have
be
something
great
about
George
Vavasor
,
or
he
would
not
have
be
so
idolize
by
such
a
girl
as
his
sister
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
early
in
the
present
spring
,
before
the
arrangement
for
the
swiss
journey
be
make
,
George
Vavasor
have
speak
to
Alice
about
that
intend
marriage
which
have
be
break
off
by
the
lady
's
death
.
<EOS>
He
be
sit
one
evening
with
his
cousin
in
the
drawing
-
room
in
Queen
Anne
Street
,
wait
for
Kate
,
who
be
to
join
him
there
before
go
to
some
party
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
Kate
have
have
a
hint
from
her
brother
to
be
late
!
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
the
two
be
together
for
an
hour
,
and
the
talk
have
be
all
about
himself
.
<EOS>
He
have
congratulate
her
on
her
engagement
with
Mr.
Grey
,
which
have
just
become
known
to
him
,
and
have
then
speak
of
his
own
last
intend
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
grieve
for
her

he
say
,
"
greatly

<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
you
do

George

yes

I
do

for
her

herself

<EOS>
of
course
the
world
have
give
me
credit
for
lament
the
loss
of
her
money
.
<EOS>
but
the
truth
be
,
that
as
regard
both
herself
and
her
money
,
it
be
much
well
for
me
that
we
be
never
married

do
you

yes

so

no

she
be
at

It

four
thousand

goodness
know
whether
I

I

certainly
spend
it

<EOS>
Alice
do
not
quite
understand
him
,
and
perhaps
he
do
not
intend
that
she
should
.
<EOS>
perhaps
his
object
be
to
mystify
her
imagination
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
understand
him
,
but
I
fear
that
she
admire
the
kind
of
courage
which
he
profess
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
not
only
profess
it
:
in
that
matter
of
the
past
election
he
have
certainly
practise
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
talking
of
beauty
to
his
sister
he
have
speak
of
himself
as
be
ugly
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
generally
have
be
call
ugly
by
woman
,
have
not
one
side
of
his
face
be
dreadfully
scar
by
a
cicatrice
,
which
in
healing
,
have
leave
a
dark
indent
line
down
from
his
left
eye
to
his
low
jaw
.
<EOS>
that
black
ravine
run
through
his
cheek
be
certainly
ugly
.
<EOS>
on
some
occasion
,
when
he
be
angry
or
disappointed
,
it
be
very
hideous
;
for
he
would
so
contort
his
face
that
the
scar
would
,
as
it
be
,
stretch
itself
out
,
reveal
all
its
horror
,
and
his
countenance
would
become
all
scar
.

<EOS>
He
look
at
me
like
the
devil
himself
 
make
the
hole
in

gape
at
me

the
old
squire
have
say
to
John
Vavasor
in
describe
the
interview
in
which
the
grandson
have
try
to
bully
his
grandfather
into
assent
to
his
own
view
about
the
mortgage
.
<EOS>
but
in
other
respect
George
's
face
be
not
ugly
,
and
may
have
be
think
handsome
by
many
woman
.
<EOS>
His
hair
be
black
,
and
be
part
in
the
front
.
<EOS>
His
forehead
,
though
low
,
be
broad
.
<EOS>
His
eye
be
dark
and
bright
,
and
his
eyebrow
be
very
full
,
and
perfectly
black
.
<EOS>
at
those
period
of
his
anger
,
all
his
face
which
be
not
scar
,
be
eye
and
eyebrow
.
<EOS>
He
wear
a
thick
black
moustache
,
which
cover
his
mouth
,
but
no
whisker
.
<EOS>
People
say
of
him
that
he
be
so
proud
of
his
wound
that
he
would
not
grow
a
hair
to
cover
it
.
<EOS>
the
fact
,
however
,
be
that
no
whisker
could
be
make
to
come
sufficiently
forward
to
be
of
service
,
and
therefore
he
wear
none
.
  
<EOS>
the
story
of
that
wound
should
be
tell
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
yet
hardly
more
than
a
boy
,
before
he
have
come
up
to
London
,
he
be
live
in
a
house
in
the
country
which
his

at

time
his

be
absent
,
and
he
and
his

only
be
in
the
house
with
the
maid

servant

<EOS>
His
sister
have
a
few
jewel
in
her
room
,
and
an
exaggerated
report
of
them
have
come
to
the
ear
of
certain
enterprising
burglar

<EOS>
a
small

in

at
the

witching
hour
of

a

creep
up

,
in

unarmed

George

fly
at
the

<EOS>
two
hour
elapse
before
the
horror

stricken
woman
of
the
house
could
bring
man

the
place

George

face
have
then
be
rip

downward

with

chisel

but
the
man
be
dead
.
<EOS>
George
have
wrench
from
him
his
own
tool
,
and
have
first
jabbed
him
all
over
with
insufficient
wound
,
have
at
last
drive
the
steel
through
his
windpipe

<EOS>
the
small
boy
escape
,
carry
with
him
two
shilling

threepence

Kate

<EOS>
George
Vavasor
be
rather
low
in
stature
,
but
well
make
,
with
small
hand
and
foot
,
but
broad
in
the
chest
and
strong
in
the
loin
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
fine
horseman
and
a
hard
rider
;
and
man
who
have
know
him
well
say
that
he
could
fence
and
shoot
with
a
pistol
as
few
man
care
to
do
in
these
peaceable
day
.
<EOS>
since
volunteering
have
come
up
,
he
have
become
a
captain
of
volunteer
,
and
have
win
prize
with
his
rifle
at
Wimbledon
.
  
<EOS>
such
have
be
the
life
of
George
Vavasor
,
and
such
be
his
character
,
and
such
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
have
always
live
alone
in
London
,
and
do
so
at
present

just
now
his

much
with
him

Kate

in

<EOS>
on
the
evening
before
they
start
for

,
George

Kate
walk
from
Queen
Anne
Street
,
where
they
have
be
dine
with

<EOS>
everything
have
be
settle
about

hour
of
starting

and
route
as

<EOS>
that
portion
of
Mr.

allude
to

<EOS>
"
I
will
endeavour

as

the
breakfast

I
can
only

you

me
to
severe
trial

early
hour

<EOS>
the
brother
and

walk
through
two
or
three
street
in
silence
,
and
then
Kate
ask
a
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
George
,
I
wonder
what
your
wish
really
be
about
Alice
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
she
should
not
want
her
breakfast
too
early

we
be
away

that
mean
that

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

it

not

then
it

to
hold
yours

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
not
that
either

<EOS>

then
what
do
it
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
I
have
no
fix
wish
on
the
subject

she
will
marry
this
man
John

then
no

will
hear
another
word
about
her

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

She
will
no

,
if
you

probably
she
will
whether
you

not

if
you
wish
to
interfere

She

yes

she

more

would

very
small
chance

off

It
be
true
that
I

from
Switzerland

should
find
such

Ludgate

now

a

more

<EOS>
the
Vavasors
be
not
very
energetic
on
their
tour
.
<EOS>
as
George
have
say
,
they
have
go
out
for
pleasure
and
not
for
work
.
<EOS>
They
go
direct
to
Interlaken
and
then
hang
about
between
that
place
and
Grindelwald
and
Lauterbrunnen
,
It
delight
him
to
sit
still
on
some
outer
bench
,
look
at
the
mountain
,
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
,
and
it
seem
to
delight
them
to
be
with
him

<EOS>
much
that
Mr.

prophesy
have
come
true

"
what
fine
fellow
those
Alpine

man
think
themselves

he
say
on

and
how
thoroughly
they
despise
the
sort

enjoyment
I
get
from

they

I
do

Alice

they
be
mistaken

he
continue
.
<EOS>
"
They
rob
the
mountain
of
their
poetry
,
which
be
or
should
be
their
great
charm
.
<EOS>
Mont
Blanc
can
have
no
mystery
for
a
man
who
have
be
up
it
half
a
dozen
time
.
<EOS>
It
be
like
get
behind
the
scene
at
a
ballet
,
or
make
a
conjuror
explain
his
trick
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
be
the
exercise
nothing
?
"
say
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
the
exercise
be
very
fine
;
 
but
that
avoid
the
question

<EOS>
"
  
"
and
they
all
botanize
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>

I
do
not

it

<EOS>
I
believe
that
the
most
of
them
simply
walk
up
the
mountain
and
down
again
.
<EOS>
but
if
they
do
,
that
avoid
the
question
also
.
<EOS>
the
poetry
and
mystery
of
the
mountain
be
lose
to
those
who
make
themselves
familiar
with
their
detail
,
not
the
less
because
such
familiarity
may
have
useful
result
.
<EOS>
in
this
world
thing
be
beautiful
only
because
they
be
not
quite
see
,
or
not
perfectly
understand
.
<EOS>
poetry
be
precious
chiefly
because
it
suggest
more
than
it
declare
.
<EOS>
look
in
there
,
through
that
valley
,
where
you
just
see
the
distant
little
peak
at
the
end
.
<EOS>
be
you
not
dream
of
the
unknown
beautiful
world
that
exist
up
there
;
 
beautiful
,
as
heaven
be
beautiful
,
because
you
know
nothing
of
the
reality
?
<EOS>
if
you
make
your
way
up
there
and
back
to
-
morrow
,
and
find
out
all
about
it
,
do
you
mean
to
say
that
it
will
be
as
beautiful
to
you
when
you
come
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
I
think
it
would
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
have
no
poetry
in
you
.
<EOS>
now
I
be
make
up
of
poetry
.
<EOS>
"
after
that
they
begin
to
laugh
at
him
and
be
very
happy
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
that
Mr.
Grey
be
right
in
answer
Alice
's
letter
as
he
do
;
but
I
think
that
Lady
Macleod
be
also
right
in
say
that
Alice
should
not
have
go
to
Switzerland
in
company
with
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
a
peculiar
familiarity
spring
up
,
which
,
have
all
its
circumstance
be
know
to
Mr.
Grey
,
would
not
have
entirely
satisfy
him
,
even
though
no
word
be
say
which
may
in
itself
have
displease
him
.
<EOS>
during
the
first
week
of
their
travel
<EOS>
no
word
be
say
which
would
have
displease
him
;
but
at
last
,
when
the
time
for
their
return
be
draw
nigh
,
when
their
happiness
be
nearly
over
,
and
that
feeling
of
melancholy
be
come
on
them
which
always
pervade
the
last
hour
of
any
period
that
have
be
pleasant
,
 
then
word
become
soft
than
they
have
be
,
and
reference
be
make
to
old
day
,
 
allusion
which
never
should
have
be
permit
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
have
be
very
happy
,
 
more
happy
perhaps
in
that
she
have
be
a
joint
minister
with
Kate
to
her
cousin
George
's
idle
fantasy
,
than
she
would
have
be
hurry
about
with
him
as
her
slave
.
<EOS>
They
have
tacitly
agree
to
spoil
him
with
comfort
;
and
girl
be
always
happy
in
spoil
some
man
than
in
be
spoil
by
man
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
take
it
all
well
,
do
his
despotism
pleasantly
,
exact
much
,
but
exact
nothing
that
be
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
be
amusing
always
,
as
Alice
think
without
any
effort
.
<EOS>
but
man
and
woman
,
when
they
show
themselves
at
their
good
,
seldom
do
so
without
an
effort
.
<EOS>
if
the
object
be
near
the
heart
the
effort
will
be
pleasant
to
him
who
make
it
,
and
if
it
be
make
well
,
it
will
be
hide
;
but
,
not
the
less
,
will
the
effort
be
there
.
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
have
on
the
present
occasion
do
his
very
good
to
please
his
cousin

<EOS>
They
be
sit
at
Basle

evening

loud

It

and
now
you

It

no

you

out

I
believe
girl
always
think
that
a
bachelor

London
have
the
happy
of
all
life

<EOS>
It
be
because
they
think
so
that
they
generally
want
to
put
an
end
to
the
man
's
condition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

It
be
envy
that
make

It

with

<EOS>
a

whatever

you

I

down

very
soon

<EOS>
Alice
and
George
be
leave
together
sit
in
the
balcony
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
alone
together
before
many
time
since
their
travel
have
commence
;
but
they
both
of
them
feel
that
there
be
something
to
them
in
the
present
moment
different
from
any
other
period
of
their
journey
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
that
each
feel
to
be
sweet
,
undefinable
,
and
dangerous
.
<EOS>
Alice
have
know
that
it
would
be
well
for
her
to
go
up
-
stair
with
Kate
;
but
Kate
's
answer
have
be
of
such
a
nature
that
have
she
go
she
would
have
show
that
she
have
some
special
reason
for
go
.
<EOS>
why
should
she
show
such
a
need
?
<EOS>
or
why
,
indeed
,
should
she
entertain
it
?
  
<EOS>
Alice
be
seat
quite
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
,
and
Kate
's
chair
be
at
her
foot
in
the
corner
.
<EOS>
when
Alice
and
Kate
have
seat
themselves
,
the
waiter
have
bring
a
small
table
for
the
coffee
-
cup
,
and
George
have
place
his
chair
on
the
other
side
of
that
.
<EOS>
so
that
Alice
be
,
as
it
be
,
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
slip
away
without
some
special
preparation
for
go
,
and
Kate
have
so
place
her
chair
in
leave
,
that
she
must
actually
have
ask
George
to
move
it
before
she
could
escape
.
<EOS>
but
why
should
she
wish
to
escape
?
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
lovely
and
enticing
than
the
scene
before
her
.
<EOS>
the
night
have
come
on
,
with
quick
but
still
unperceived
approach
,
as
it
do
in
those
part
;
for
the
twilight
there
be
not
prolong
as
it
be
with
us
more
northern
folk
.
<EOS>
the
night
have
come
on
,
but
there
be
a
rise
moon
,
which
just
suffice
to
give
a
sheen
to
the
water
beneath
her
.
<EOS>
the
air
be
deliciously
soft
;
 
of
that
softness
which
produce
no
sensation
either
of
warmth
or
cold
,
but
which
just
seem
to
touch
one
with
love
tenderness
,
as
though
the
unseen
spirit
of
the
air
kiss
one
's
forehead
as
they
pass
on
their
wing
.
<EOS>
the
Rhine
be
run
at
her
foot
,
so
near
,
that
in
the
soft
half
light
it
seem
as
though
she
may
step
into
its
ripple
.
<EOS>
the
Rhine
be
run
by
with
that
delicious
sound
of
rapidly
move
water
,
that
fresh
refreshing
gurgle
of
the
river
,
which
be
so
delicious
to
the
ear
at
all
time
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
talk
,
it
wrap
up
your
speech
,
keep
it
for
yourself
,
make
it
difficult
neither
to
her
who
listen
nor
to
him
who
speak
.
<EOS>
if
you
would
sleep
,
it
be
of
all
lullaby
the
sweetest
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
alone
and
would
think
,
it
aid
all
your
thought
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
alone
,
and
,
alas
!
<EOS>
would
not
think
,
 
if
thinking
be
too
painful
,
 
it
will
dispel
your
sorrow
,
and
give
the
comfort
which
music
alone
can
give
.
<EOS>
Alice
feel
that
the
air
kiss
her
,
that
the
river
sing
for
her
its
sweetest
song
,
that
the
moon
shine
for
her
with
its
soft
light
,
 
that
light
which
lend
the
poetry
of
half
-
develop
beauty
to
everything
that
it
touch
.
<EOS>
why
should
she
leave
it
?
  
<EOS>
nothing
be
say
for
some
minute
after
Kate
's
departure
,
and
Alice
be
begin
to
shake
from
her
that
half
feeling
of
danger
which
have
come
over
her
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
have
sit
back
in
his
chair
,
lean
against
the
house
,
with
his
foot
raise
upon
a
stool
;
his
arm
be
fold
across
his
breast
,
and
he
seem
to
have
divide
himself
between
his
thought
and
his
cigar
.
<EOS>
Alice
be
look
full
upon
the
river
,
and
her
thought
have
stray
away
to
her
future
home
among
John
Grey
's
flower
-
bed
and
shrub
;
but
<EOS>
the
river
,
though
it
sing
to
her
pleasantly
,
seem
to
sing
a
song
of
other
thing
than
such
a
home
as
that
,
 
a
song
full
of
mystery
,
as
be
all
river
song
when
one
try
to
understand
their
word

<EOS>
"
when

George
at

I

at
Nethercoats

I

no

on

I
do
not

of

gentleman
in
his

that
is
,
if
he
can
keep
it
up

chronic
poverty

Mr.

you

;
 
that
be
if
my
untoward
fate
do
not
induce
him
to
cut
my
acquaintance
;
 
but
as
for
friendship
,
that
will
be
over
when
you
and
I
shall
have
part
next
Thursday
evening
at
London
Bridge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
George
,
do
not
say
so
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
why
on
Thursday
?
<EOS>
do
you
mean
that
you
will
not
come
to
Queen
Anne
Street
any
more
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
that
be
what
I
do
mean
.
<EOS>
this
trip
of
our
have
be
very
successful
,
Kate
say
.
<EOS>
perhaps
Kate
know
nothing
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
have
be
very
pleasant
,
 
at
least
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
the
pleasure
have
have
no
drawback
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
none
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
have
be
very
pleasant
to
me
,
also
;
 
but
the
pleasure
have
have
its
alloy
.
<EOS>
alice
,
I
have
nothing
to
ask
from
you
,
 
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
anything
that
you
should
ask
,
I
would
do
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
ask
;
 
nothing
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
one
word
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
George
,
do
not
say
it
.
<EOS>
let
me
go
up
-
stair
.
<EOS>
let
me
go
to
Kate
.
"
  
"
certainly
;
if
you
wish
it
you
shall
go
.
"
<EOS>
He
still
hold
his
foot
against
the
chair
which
bar
her
passage
,
and
do
not
attempt
to
rise
as
he
must
have
do
to
make
way
for
her
passage
out
.
"
<EOS>
certainly
you
shall
go
to
Kate
,
if
you
refuse
to
hear
me
.
<EOS>
but
after
all
that
have
pass
between
us
,
after
these
six
week
of
intimate
companionship
,
I
think
you
ought
to
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
that
I
have
nothing
to
ask
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
go
to
make
love
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
have
commence
some
attempt
to
rise
,
but
she
have
again
settle
herself
in
her
chair
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
when
he
pause
for
a
moment
,
she
make
no
further
sign
that
she
wish
to
escape
,
nor
do
she
say
a
word
to
intimate
her
further
wish
that
he
should
be
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
go
to
make
love
to
you
,
"
he
say
again
.
"
<EOS>
as
for
make
love
,
as
the
word
go
,
that
must
be
over
between
you
and
me
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
make
and
mar
,
and
can
not
be
remake
.
<EOS>
It
may
exist
,
or
it
may
have
be
expel
;
but
where
it
do
not
exist
,
it
will
never
be
bring
back
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
should
not
be
speak
of
between
you
and
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
,
no
doubt
,
any
proper
-
going
duenna
would
say
,
and
so
,
too
,
little
child
should
be
tell
;
but
between
you
and
me
there
can
be
no
necessity
for
falsehood
.
<EOS>
We
have
grow
beyond
our
sugar
-
toothed
age
,
and
be
now
man
and
woman
.
<EOS>
I
perfectly
understand
your
breaking
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
understand
you
,
and
in
spite
of
my
sorrow
know
that
you
be
right
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
go
to
accuse
or
to
defend
myself
;
but
I
know
that
you
be
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
let
there
be
no
more
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
there
must
be
more
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
you
when
you
accept
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
against
him
I
have
not
a
whisper
to
make
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
perfect
for
aught
I
know
.
<EOS>
but
,
know
you
as
I
think
I
do
,
I
could
not
understand
your
loving
such
a
man
as
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
though
one
who
have
live
on
brandy
should
take
himself
suddenly
to
a
milk
diet
,
 
and
enjoy
the
change
!
<EOS>
a
milk
diet
be
no
doubt
the
good
.
<EOS>
but
man
who
have
live
on
brandy
can
not
make
those
change
very
suddenly
.
<EOS>
They
perish
in
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
always
,
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
do
with
month
of
agony
;
 
but
there
be
no
such
agony
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
can
tell
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
tell
me
the
cure
be
make
.
<EOS>
I
think
so
,
and
therefore
think
that
I
should
find
you
change
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
you
,
who
have
be
all
fire
,
would
now
have
turn
yourself
into
soft
-
flow
milk
and
honey
,
and
have
become
fit
for
the
life
in
store
for
you
.
<EOS>
with
such
a
one
I
may
have
travel
from
Moscow
to
Malta
without
danger
.
<EOS>
the
woman
fit
to
be
John
Grey
's
wife
<EOS>
would
certainly
do
me
no
harm
,
 
could
not
touch
my
happiness
.
<EOS>
I
may
have
love
her
once
,
 
may
still
love
the
memory
of
what
she
have
be
;
but
her
,
in
her
new
form
,
after
her
new
birth
,
 
such
a
one
as
that
,
Alice
,
could
be
nothing
to
me
.
<EOS>
do
not
mistake
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
enough
of
wisdom
in
me
to
know
how
much
well
,
ay
,
and
happy
a
woman
she
may
be
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
I
think
you
have
descend
in
the
scale
;
but
I
give
you
credit
for
virtue
which
you
have
not
acquire
.
<EOS>
alice
,
that
wholesome
diet
of
which
I
speak
be
not
your
diet
.
<EOS>
You
would
starve
on
it
,
and
perish
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
speak
with
great
energy
,
but
still
in
a
low
voice
,
have
turn
full
round
upon
the
table
,
with
both
his
arm
upon
it
,
and
his
face
stretch
out
far
over
towards
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
look
full
at
him
;
and
,
as
I
have
say
before
,
that
scar
and
his
gloomy
eye
and
thick
eyebrow
seem
to
make
up
the
whole
of
his
face
.
<EOS>
but
the
scar
have
never
be
ugly
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
know
the
story
,
and
when
he
be
her
lover
she
have
take
pride
in
the
mark
of
the
wound
.
<EOS>
She
look
at
him
,
but
though
he
pause
she
do
not
speak
.
<EOS>
the
music
of
the
river
be
still
in
her
ear
,
and
there
come
upon
her
a
struggle
as
though
she
be
strive
to
understand
its
song
.
<EOS>
be
the
water
also
tell
her
of
the
mistake
she
have
make
in
accept
Mr.
Grey
as
her
husband
?
<EOS>
what
her
cousin
be
now
tell
her
,
 
be
it
not
a
repetition
of
word
which
she
have
speak
to
herself
hundred
of
time
during
the
last
two
month
?
<EOS>
be
she
not
tell
herself
daily
,
 
hourly
,
 
always
,
 
in
every
thought
of
her
life
,
that
in
accept
Mr.
Grey
she
have
assume
herself
to
be
mistress
of
virtue
which
she
do
not
possess
?
<EOS>
have
she
not
,
in
truth
,
riot
upon
brandy
,
till
the
innocence
of
milk
be
unfitted
for
her
?
<EOS>
this
man
now
come
and
rudely
tell
her
all
this
,
 
but
do
he
not
tell
her
the
truth
?
<EOS>
She
sit
silent
and
convict
;
only
gaze
into
his
face
when
his
speech
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
learn
this
since
we
have
be
again
together
,
Alice
;
and
find
you
,
not
the
angel
I
have
suppose
,
find
you
to
be
the
same
woman
I
have
once
love
,
 
the
safety
that
I
anticipate
have
not
fall
to
my
lot
.
<EOS>
that
be
all

<EOS>
here
be
Kate

and
now
we
will
go
for
our
walk

<EOS>
the
Bridge
over
the
Rhine
.
 
<EOS>
"
George
,
"
say
Kate

speak
before
she
quite
get
up
to
them
,
"
will
you
tell
me
whether
you
have
be
prepare
all
your
thing
for
an
open
sale
by
auction
?
<EOS>
"
then
she
steal
a
look
at
Alice
,
and
have
learn
from
that
glance
that
something
have
occur
which
prevent
Alice
from
join
her
in
her
raillery
,
she
go
on
with
it
herself
rapidly
,
as
though
to
cover
Alice
's
confusion
,
and
give
her
time
to
rally
before
they
should
all
move
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Would
you
believe
it
?
<EOS>
he
have
three
razor
lay
out
on
his
table
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
a
man
must
shave
,
 
even
at
Basle
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
not
with
three
razor
at
once
;
and
three
hair
-
brush
,
and
half
a
dozen
toothbrush
,
and
a
small
collection
of
comb
,
and
four
or
five
little
glass
bottle
,
look
as
though
they
contain
poison
,
 
all
with
silver
top
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
suppose
you
desire
to
startle
the
weak
mind
of
the
chambermaid
.
<EOS>
I
have
put
them
all
up
;
but
remember
this
,
if
they
be
take
out
again
you
be
responsible
.
<EOS>
and
I
will
not
put
up
your
boot
,
George
.
<EOS>
what
can
you
have
want
with
three
pair
of
boot
at
Basle
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
when
you
have
complete
the
list
of
my
wardrobe
we
will
go
out
upon
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
that
is
,
if
Alice
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
I
shall
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
come
along
then
,
"
say
Kate
.
<EOS>
and
so
they
move
away
.
<EOS>
when
they
get
upon
the
bridge
Alice
and
Kate
be
together
,
while
George
stroll
behind
them
,
close
to
them
,
but
not
take
any
part
in
their
conversation
,
 
as
though
he
have
merely
go
with
them
as
an
escort
.
<EOS>
Kate
seem
to
be
perfectly
content
with
this
arrangement
,
chatter
to
Alice
,
so
that
she
may
show
that
there
be
nothing
serious
on
the
mind
of
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
It
need
hardly
be
say
that
Alice
at
this
time
make
no
appeal
to
George
to
join
them
.
<EOS>
He
follow
them
at
their
heel
,
with
his
hand
behind
his
back
,
look
down
upon
the
pavement
and
simply
wait
upon
their
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
,
"
say
Kate
,
"
I
have
a
very
great
mind
to
run
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
do
you
want
to
run
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
;
 
that
would
not
much
signify
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
would
go
to
the
little
inn
at
Handek
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
lonely
place
,
where
nobody
would
hear
of
me
,
 
and
I
should
have
the
waterfall
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
they
would
want
to
have
their
bill
pay
.
<EOS>
that
would
be
the
bad
of
it

"
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
run
away
just
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
,
because
you
would
not
like
go
home
with
George
alone
,
 
<EOS>
and
I
suppose
he
would
be
bind
to
look
after
me
,
as
he
be
do
now
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
he
think
of
have
to
walk
over
the
bridge
after
us
girl
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
would
be
in
that
place
down
there
drink
beer
,
if
we
be
not
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
he
want
to
go
,
I
dare
say
he
would
,
in
spite
of
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
ungrateful
of
you
,
for
I
be
sure
we
have
never
be
keep
in
a
moment
by
his
fail
us
.
<EOS>
but
as
I
be
say
,
I
do
dread
go
home
.
<EOS>
You
be
go
to
John
Grey
,
which
may
be
pleasant
enough
;
but
I
be
go
 
to
Aunt
Greenow
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
your
own
choice

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
it
be
not

<EOS>
I
have
not
any
choice
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
may
refuse
to
speak
to
Aunt
Greenow
,
and
nobody
could
make
me
;
 
but
practically
I
have
not
any
choice
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
fancy
a
month
at
Yarmouth
with
no
companion
but
such
a
woman
as
that
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
mind
it
.
<EOS>
Aunt
Greenow
always
seem
to
me
to
be
a
very
good
sort
of
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
may
be
a
good
woman
,
but
I
must
say
I
think
she
be
of
a
bad
sort
.
<EOS>
You
have
never
hear
her
talk
about
her
husband
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
never
;
I
think
she
do
cry
a
little
the
first
day
she
come
to
Queen
Anne
Street
,
but
that
be
not
unnatural
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
thirty
year
old
than
herself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
still
he
be
her
husband
.
<EOS>
and
even
if
her
tear
be
assume
,
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
what
be
a
woman
to
do
?
<EOS>
of
course
she
be
wrong
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
She
be
thirty
-
five
,
and
have
nothing
,
while
he
be
sixty
-
five
,
and
be
very
rich
.
<EOS>
accord
to
all
account
she
make
him
a
very
good
wife
,
and
now
that
she
be
get
all
his
money
,
you
would
not
have
her
go
about
laugh
within
three
month
of
his
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
would
not
have
her
laugh
;
but
neither
would
I
have
her
cry
.
<EOS>
and
she
be
quite
right
to
wear
weed
;
but
she
nee
not
be
so
very
outrageous
in
the
depth
of
her
hem
,
or
so
very
careful
that
her
cap
be
become
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
will
be
wear
out
by
their
double
service
.
<EOS>
They
be
always
red
with
weeping
,
and
yet
she
be
ready
every
minute
with
a
full
battery
of
execution
for
any
man
that
she
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
why
have
you
consent
to
go
to
Yarmouth
with
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
just
because
she
be
get
forty
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Greenow
have
leave
her
with
a
bare
maintenance
I
do
not
suppose
I
should
ever
have
hold
out
my
hand
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
be
as
bad
as
she
be

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
quite
as
bad
;
 
and
that
be
<EOS>
what
make
me
want
to
run
away
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
my
own
fault
altogether
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
fault
of
the
world
at
large
.
<EOS>
do
anybody
ever
drop
their
rich
relative
?
<EOS>
when
she
propose
to
take
me
to
Yarmouth
,
be
not
it
natural
that
the
squire
should
ask
me
to
go
?
<EOS>
when
I
tell
George
,
be
not
it
natural
that
he
should
say
,
"
oh
,
go
by
all
mean
.
<EOS>
She
be
get
forty
thousand
pound
!
<EOS>
"
one
can
not
pretend
to
be
wise
or
well
than
one
's
relative
.
<EOS>
and
after
all
what
can
I
expect
from
her
money
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
a
halfpenny
.
<EOS>
I
be
nearly
thirty
<EOS>
and
she
be
only
forty
,
and
of
course
she
will
marry
again
.
<EOS>
I
will
say
of
myself
,
too
,
that
no
person
live
care
less
for
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
no
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yet
one
stick
to
one
's
rich
relative
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
way
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
she
pause
a
moment
.
"
<EOS>
but
shall
I
tell
you
,
Alice
,
why
I
do
stick
to
her
?
<EOS>
perhaps
you
will
think
the
object
as
mean
as
though
I
want
her
money
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
be
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
it
be
on
the
card
that
she
may
help
George
in
his
career
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
money
,
but
he
may
.
<EOS>
and
for
such
purpose
as
his
,
I
think
it
fair
that
all
the
family
should
contribute
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
that
he
would
make
a
name
for
himself
in
Parliament
;
and
if
I
have
my
way
I
would
spend
every
shilling
of
Vavasor
money
in
put
him
there
.
<EOS>
when
I
tell
the
squire
<EOS>
so
I
think
he
would
have
eat
me
.
<EOS>
I
really
do
think
he
would
have
turn
me
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
serve
you
right
too
after
what
have
happen
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
.
<EOS>
let
him
turn
me
out
.
<EOS>
I
be
determine
he
should
know
what
I
think
.
<EOS>
He
swear
at
me
;
and
then
he
be
so
unhappy
at
what
he
have
do
that
he
come
and
kiss
me
that
night
in
my
bedroom
,
and
give
me
a
ten
-
pound
note
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
I
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
I
send
it
as
a
contribution
to
the
next
election
and
George
have
it
now
lock
up
in
a
box
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
tell
him
that
I
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
then
they
stop
and
lean
for
a
while
over
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
"
come
here
,
George
,
"
say
Kate
;
and
she
make
room
for
him
between
herself
and
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
Would
not
you
like
to
be
swim
down
there
as
those
boy
be
do
when
we
go
out
into
the
balcony
?
<EOS>
the
water
look
so
enticing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
I
should
;
 
unless
it
may
be
a
pleasant
way
of
swimming
into
the
next
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
so
like
to
feel
myself
go
with
the
stream
,
"
say
Kate
;
"
particularly
by
this
light
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
fancy
in
the
least
that
I
should
be
drown
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
fancy
anything
else
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
so
pleasant
to
feel
the
water
glide
along
one
's
limb
,
and
to
be
carry
away
headlong
,
 
know
that
you
be
on
the
direct
road
to
Rotterdam
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
and
so
arrive
there
without
your
clothe
,
"

George
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
would
be
bring
after
in
a
boat
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
see
that
those
boy
have
a
boat
with
them
?
<EOS>
but
if
I
live
here
,
I
would
never
do
it
except
by
moonlight
.
<EOS>
the
water
look
so
clear
and
bright
now
,
and
the
rushing
sound
of
it
be
so
soft
!
<EOS>
the
sea
at
Yarmouth
will
not
be
anything
like
that
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
neither
of
them
any
longer
answer
her
,
and
yet
she
go
on
talk
about
the
river
,
and
their
aunt
,
and
her
prospect
at
Yarmouth
.
<EOS>
neither
of
them
answer
her
,
and
yet
it
seem
that
they
have
not
a
word
to
say
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
but
still
they
stand
there
look
down
upon
the
river
,
and
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
Kate
's
voice
be
to
be
hear
,
prevent
the
feeling
which
may
otherwise
have
arise
that
their
heart
be
too
full
for
speech
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
Alice
seem
to
shiver
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
slight
trembling
in
her
arm
,
which
George
feel
rather
than
see
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
cold
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
let
us
go
in

<EOS>
I
think
you
shiver
with
the
night
air
.

<EOS>
"
It
be
not
that
.
<EOS>
I
be
think
of
something
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
ever
think
of
thing
that
make
you
shiver
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
do
,
very
often
;
 
so
often
that
I
have
to
do
my
shivering
inwardly
.
<EOS>
otherwise
people
would
think
I
have
the
palsy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
thing
of
moment
,
"
say
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
little
bit
of
thing
make
me
do
it
;
 
perhaps
a
word
that
I
say
and
ought
not
to
have
say
ten
year
ago
;
 
the
most
ordinary
little
mistake
,
even
my
own
past
thought
to
myself
about
the
mere
trifle
.
<EOS>
They
be
always
make
me
shiver

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
because
you
have
commit
any
murder
then
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;

it
be
my
conscience
all
the

"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
I
be
not
so
good
as
you

I
doubt
it

not
my
conscience
at
all

<EOS>
when
I
think
of
a
chance
I
have
let
go
by
,
as
I
have
thousand
,
then
it
be
that
I
shiver
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
tell
you
,
I
shiver
inwardly
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
in
one
long
shiver
ever
since
we
come
out
because
of
one
chance
that
I
let
go
by
.
<EOS>
come
,
we
will
go
in
.
<EOS>
We
have
to
be
up
at
five
o'clock
,
and
now
it
be
eleven
.
<EOS>
I
will
do
the
rest
of
my
shivering
in
bed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
tired
of
be
out
?

say
Kate
,
when
the
other
two
begin
to
move
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
tired
of
be
out
,

George
remind
me
that
we
have
to
be
up
at
five
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
George
would
hold
his
tongue

<EOS>
We
can
not
come
to
the
bridge
at
Basle
every
night
in
our
life
.
<EOS>
if
one
find
oneself
at
the
top
of
Sinai

I
be
afraid
the
first
feeling
would
be
one
of
fear
lest
one
would
not
be
down
in
time
to
dress
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
be
you
aware
,
George
,
that
the
king
of
river
be
run
beneath
your
foot
,

that
the
moon
be
shine
with
a
brilliance
you
never

at
home

<EOS>
"
I
will
stay
here
all
night

put
off

-
morrow

George

Our
money
would
not
hold
out

Kate

<EOS>
"
do
not
talk
about
Sinai
any
more
after
that
,
"
say
he
,
"
but
let
's
go
in
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
walk
across
the
bridge
back
to
the
hotel
in
the
same
manner
as
before
,
the
two
girl
go
together
with
the
young
man
after
them
,
and
so
they
go
up
the
front
step
of
the
hotel
,
through
the
hall
,

on
to
the
stair
.
<EOS>
here
George
hand
Alice
her
candle
,
and
as
he
do
so
he
whisper
a
few
word
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
My
shivering
fit
have
to
come
yet
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
will
last
me
the
whole
night

<EOS>
"
She
would
have
give
much
to
be
able
to
answer
him
lightly
,
as
though
what
he
have
say
have
mean
nothing
;
 
but
she
could
not
do
it
;
the
light
speech
would
not
come
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
conscious
of
all
this
,
and
go
away
to
her
own
room
without
answer
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
here
she
sit
down
at
the
window
look
out
upon
the
river
till
Kate
should
join
her
.
<EOS>
Their
room
open
through
from
one
to
the
other
,
and
she
would
not
begin
her
packing
till
her
cousin
should
come
.
  
<EOS>

Kate
have
go
with
her
brother
,
promising
,
as
she
do
so
,
that
she
would
be
back
in
half
a
minute

that
half
minute
be
protract
beyond
half
an
hour

"
if

will
take
my
advice

Kate

at
last

up
with
her
candle
in

hand

will
ask
her

plain
word

give
you
another
chance

it
to

most
powerful
feeling

in

that

out

tell
him
,

there
be
nothing

so
much

Alice
would
not
consent

about
two
they
get
into
bed

punctually
at
six
they
be
at

station

do
not

door

passage

"
I
shall
only
yawn

however

they
be
in
time

mean
abroad
that

at

station
half
an
hour

train
start

two
day

night

road
from
Basle
to
London

during
those
two
day
and
night
neither

speak

Alice

marriage

be
any

make

Greenow

remain
only
three
day
in

during

three
day
she
be
not
much
with

I
be

,
body
and
soul

for
the
next
six
week

,
when

do
come
to
Queen
Anne
Street
on
the
morning
after
her
arrival

she
be
exigeant

manner
I
can
not
at
all
explain
to
you

must
not
be
surprised
if
I
do
not
even
write
a
line
.
<EOS>
I
have
escape
by
stealth
now
.
<EOS>
She
go
up
-
stair
to
try
on
some
new
weed
for
the
seaside
,
and
then
I
bolt
.
<EOS>
"
She
do
not
say
a
word
about
George
;
nor
during
those
three
day
,
nor
for
some
day
afterwards
,
do
George
show
himself
.
<EOS>
as
it
turn
out
afterwards
,
he
have
go
off
to
Scotland
,
and
have
remain
a
week
among
the
grouse
.
<EOS>
thus
,
at
least
,
he
have
account
for
himself
and
his
movement
;
but
all
George
Vavasor
's
friend
know
that
his
going
out
and
coming
in
be
seldom
account
for
openly
like
those
of
other
man
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
perhaps
be
as
well
to
say
a
few
word
about
Mrs.
Greenow
before
we
go
with
her
to
Yarmouth
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
be
the
only
daughter
and
the
young
child
of
the
old
squire
at
Vavasor
Hall
.
<EOS>
She
be
just
ten
year
young
than
her
brother
John
,
and
I
be
inclined
to
think
that
she
be
almost
justified
in
her
repeat
assertion
that
the
difference
be
much
great
than
ten
year
,
by
the
freshness
of
her
colour
,
and
by
the
general
juvenility
of
her
appearance
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
do
not
look
forty
,
and
who
can
expect
a
woman
to
proclaim
herself
to
be
old
than
her
look
?
<EOS>
in
early
life
she
have
be
take
from
her
father
's
house
,
and
have
live
with
relative
in
one
of
the
large
town
in
the
north
of
England
.
<EOS>
It
be
certain
she
have
not
be
quite
successful
as
a
girl
.
<EOS>
though
she
have
enjoy
the
name
of
be
a
beauty
,
she
have
not
the
usual
success
which
come
from
such
repute
.
<EOS>
at
thirty
-
four
she
be
still
unmarried
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
moreover
,
acquire
the
character
of
be
a
flirt
;
and
I
fear
that
the
story
which
be
tell
of
her
,
though
doubtless
more
than
half
false
,
have
in
them
sufficient
of
truth
to
justify
the
character
.
<EOS>
now
this
be
very
sad
,
see
that
Arabella
Vavasor
have
no
fortune
,
and
that
she
have
offend
her
father
and
brother
by
decline
to
comply
with
their
advice
at
certain
period
of
her
career
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
indeed
,
considerable
trouble
in
the
mind
of
the
various
male
vavasor
with
reference
to
Arabella
,
when
tiding
suddenly
reach
the
Hall
that
she
be
go
to
be
marry
to
an
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
marry
to
the
old
man
;
and
the
marriage
fortunately
turn
out
satisfactorily
,
at
any
rate
for
the
old
man
and
for
her
family
.
<EOS>
the
Vavasors
be
relieve
from
all
further
trouble
,
and
be
as
much
surprised
as
gratify
when
they
hear
that
she
do
her
duty
well
in
her
new
position
.
<EOS>
Arabella
have
long
be
a
thorn
in
their
side
,
never
have
really
do
anything
which
they
could
pronounce
to
be
absolutely
wrong
,
but
always
give
them
cause
for
fear
.
<EOS>
now
they
fear
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
be
a
retire
merchant
,
very
rich
,
not
very
strong
in
health
,
and
devote
to
his
bride
.
<EOS>
Rumours
soon
make
their
way
to
Vavasor
Hall
,
and
to
Queen
Anne
Street
,
that
Mrs.
Greenow
be
quite
a
pattern
wife
,
and
that
Mr.
Greenow
consider
himself
to
be
the
happy
old
man
in
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
and
now
in
her
prosperity
she
quite
forgave
the
former
slight
which
have
be
put
upon
her
by
her
relative
.
<EOS>
She
write
to
her
dear
niece
Alice
,
and
to
her
dear
niece
Kate
,
and
send
little
present
to
her
father
.
<EOS>
on
one
occasion
she
take
her
husband
to
Vavasor
Hall
,
and
there
be
a
regular
renewal
of
all
the
old
family
feeling
.
<EOS>
Arabella
's
husband
be
an
old
man
,
and
be
very
old
for
his
age
;
but
the
whole
thing
be
quite
respectable
,
and
there
be
,
at
any
rate
,
no
doubt
about
the
money
.
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Greenow
die
;
and
the
widow
,
have
prove
the
will
,
come

why
not
go
to
Yarmouth
with
her
for
a
month

"
George
have
say
to
Kate

"
of
course
it
will
be
a
bore

with
forty
thousand

have
a
right
to
claim
attention

"
<EOS>
Kate
acknowledge
the
truth
of
the
argument
and
agree
to
go
to
Yarmouth
for
a
month

<EOS>
Your
aunt
Arabella
have
show
herself
to
be
a
very
sensible
woman
,
"
the
old
squire
have
write
;
"
much
more
sensible
than
anybody
think
her
before
her
marriage

<EOS>
of
course
you
should
go
with
her
if
she
ask
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
aunt
,
uncle
,
or
cousin
,
in
the
uncontrolled
possession
of
forty
thousand
pound
be
ever
unpopular
in
the
family
?
  
<EOS>
Yarmouth
be
not
a
very
prepossessing
place
to
the
eye
.
<EOS>
to
my
eye
,
at
any
rate
,
it
be
not
so
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
old
town
with
which
summer
visitor
have
little
or
nothing
to
do
;
and
there
be
the
new
house
down
by
the
sea
-
side
,
to
which
,
at
any
rate
,
belong
the
full
advantage
of
sea
air
.
<EOS>
a
kind
of
esplanade
run
for
nearly
a
mile
along
the
sand
,
and
there
be
build
,
or
in
the
course
of
building
,
row
of
house
appropriate
to
summer
visitor
all
look
out
upon
the
sea
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
beauty
unless
the
yellow
sandy
sea
can
be
call
beautiful
.
<EOS>
the
coast
be
low
and
straight
,
and
the
east
wind
blow
full
upon
it
.
<EOS>
but
the
place
be
healthy
;
and
Mrs.
Greenow
be
probably
right
in
think
that
she
may
there
revive
some
portion
of
the
health
which
she
have
lose
in
watch
beside
the
couch
of
her
depart
lord
.
  
<EOS>
"
Omnibus
;
 
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
Jeannette
,
get
me
a
fly
.
<EOS>
"
these
be
the
first
word
Mrs.
Greenow
speak
as
she
put
her
foot
upon
the
platform
at
the
Yarmouth
station
.
<EOS>
Her
maid
's
name
be
Jenny
;
but
Kate
have
already
find
,
somewhat
to
her
dismay
,
that
order
have
be
issue
before
they
leave
London
that
the
girl
be
henceforth
to
be
call
Jeannette
.
<EOS>
Kate
have
also
already
find
that
her
aunt
could
be
imperious
;
but
this
taste
for
masterdom
have
not
show
itself
so
plainly
in
London
as
it
do
from
the
moment
that
the
train
have
leave
the
station
at
Shoreditch
.
<EOS>
in
London
Mrs.
Greenow
have
be
among
Londoners
,
and
her
career
have
hitherto
be
provincial
.
<EOS>
Her
spirit
,
no
doubt
,
have
be
somewhat
cow
by
the
novelty
of
her
position
.
<EOS>
but
when
she
feel
herself
to
be
once
beyond
the
stone
as
the
saying
use
to
be
,
she
be
herself
again
;
and
at
Ipswich
she
have
order
Jeannette
to
get
her
a
glass
of
sherry
with
an
air
which
have
create
a
good
deal
of
attention
among
the
guard
and
porter
.
  
<EOS>
the
fly
be
procure
;
and
with
considerable
exertion
<EOS>
all
Mrs.
Greenow
's
box
,
together
with
the
more
moderate
belonging
of
her
niece
and
maid
,
be
stow
on
the
top
of
it
,
round
upon
the
driver
's
body
on
the
coach
box
,
on
the
maid
's
lap
,
and
I
fear
in
Kate
's
also
,
and
upon
the
vacant
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
large
house
in
Montpelier
Parade

"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
all
large

madam

the
driver

Mrs.
Greenow

<EOS>
"
They
be
much

the

<EOS>
"
then
Mrs.
Jones

Mrs.

<EOS>
"

I
be
particularly
tell
it

<EOS>
"
I
know
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jones
's
well

say
the
driver
,
<EOS>
and
away
they
go
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jones
's
house
be
handsome
and
comfortable
;
but
I
fear
Mrs.
Greenow
's
satisfaction
in
this
respect
be
impair
by
her
disappointment
in
find
that
it
be
not
perceptibly
big
than
those
to
the
right
and
leave
of
her
.
<EOS>
Her
ambition
in
this
and
in
other
similar
matter
would
have
amuse
Kate
greatly
have
she
be
a
bystander
,
and
not
one
of
her
aunt
's
party
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
be
good
-
natured
,
liberal
,
and
not
by
nature
selfish
;
but
she
be
determine
not
to
waste
the
good
thing
which
fortune
have
give
,
and
desire
that
all
the
world
should
see
that
she
have
forty
thousand
pound
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
and
in
do
this
she
be
repress
by
no
feeling
of
false
shame
.
<EOS>
She
never
hesitate
in
her
demand
through
bashfulness
.
<EOS>
She
call
aloud
for
such
comfort
and
grandeur
as
Yarmouth
could
afford
her
,
and
be
well
pleased
that
all
around
should
hear
her
calling
.
<EOS>
join
to
all
this
be
her
uncontrolled
grief
for
her
husband
's
death
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Greenow

oh

<EOS>
when

this
she

She

take
a

as
she

she

not

why

<EOS>
the
next
day
be
Sunday
;
and
it
be
beautiful
to
see
how
Mrs.
Greenow
go
to
church
in
all
the
glory
of
widowhood
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
great
unpacking
after
that
banquet
on
the
sweetbread
,
and
all
her
funereal
millinery
have
be
display
before
Kate
's
wonder
eye
.
<EOS>
the
charm
of
the
woman
be
in
this
,
 
that
she
be
not
in
the
least
ashamed
of
anything
that
she
do
.
<EOS>
She
turn
over
all
her
wardrobe
of
mourning
,
show
the
richness
of
each
article
,
the
stiffness
of
the
crape
,
the
fineness
of
the
cambric
,
the
breadth
of
the
frill
,
 
tell
the
price
of
each
to
a
shilling
,
while
she
explain
how
the
whole
have
be
amass
without
any
consideration
of
expense
.
<EOS>
this
she
do
with
all
the
pride
of
a
young
bride
when
she
show
the
glory
of
her
trousseau
to
the
friend
of
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
Jeannette
stand
by
the
while
,
remove
one
thing
and
exhibit
another
.
<EOS>
now
and
again
through
the
performance
,
Mrs.
Greenow
would
rest
a
while
from
her
employment
,
and
address
the
shade
of
the
depart
one
in
term
of
most
endearing
affection
.
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
this
Mrs.
Jones
come
in
;
but
the
widow
be
not
a
whit
abash
by
the
presence
of
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
peace
be
to
his
mane

"
<EOS>
she
say
at
last
,
as
she
carefully
fold
up
a
huge
black
crape
mantilla
.
<EOS>
She
make
,
however
,
but
one
syllable
of
the
classical
word
,
and
Mrs.
Jones
think
that
her
lodger
have
address
herself
to
the
mortal
"
remain

of
her
deceased
lord
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
leave
her
uncommon
well
off

I
suppose
,
"
say
Mrs.
Jones
to
Jeannette
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
say
that
,
madam

<EOS>
It
be
more
nor

hundred
thousand
of

"
  
<EOS>
"
no
!
"

of
sterling

madam

indeed
it
be
;
 
to
my
knowledge

"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
she
have
a
carriage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
she
do
;
 
but
a
lady
can
not
bring
her
carriage
down
to
the
sea
when
she
be
only
just
bury
her
husband
as
one
may
say
.
<EOS>
what
have
folk
say
if
they
see
her
in
her
own
carriage
?
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
because
she
can
not
afford
it
,
Mrs.
Jones
.
<EOS>
and
now
we
be
talk
of
it
<EOS>
you
must
order
a
fly
for
church
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
,
that
will
look
private
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
She
say
I
be
to
get
a
man
that
have
a
livery
coat
and
glove
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
man
with
the
coat
and
glove
be
procure
;
and
Mrs.
Greenow
's
entry
into
church
make
quite
a
sensation
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
thoughtfulness
about
her
<EOS>
which
alone
show
that
she
be
a
woman
of
no
ordinary
power
.
<EOS>
She
foresee
all
necessity
,
and
make
provision
for
all
emergency
.
<EOS>
another
would
not
have
secure
an
eligible
sitting
,
and
be
at
home
in
Yarmouth
church
,
till
half
the
period
of
her
sojourn
there
be
over
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Greenow
have
do
it
all
.
<EOS>
She
walk
up
the
middle
aisle
with
as
much
self
-
possession
as
though
the
chancel
have
belong
to
her
family
for
year
;
and
the
respectable
pew
-
opener
absolutely
desert
two
or
three
old
lady
whom
she
be
attend
,
to
show
Mrs.
Greenow
into
her
seat
.
<EOS>
when
seat
,
she
be
the
cynosure
of
all
eye
.
<EOS>
Kate
Vavasor
become
immediately
aware
that
a
great
sensation
have
be
occasion
by
their
entrance
,
and
equally
aware
that
none
of
it
be
due
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
regret
to
say
that
this
feeling
continue
to
show
itself
throughout
the
whole
service
.
<EOS>
how
many
lady
of
forty
go
to
church
without
attract
the
least
attention
!
<EOS>
but
it
be
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
every
person
in
that
church
have
look
at
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
there
be
present
there
a
single
married
lady
who
,
on
leave
the
building
,
do
not
speak
to
her
husband
of
the
widow
.
<EOS>
there
have
prevail
during
the
whole
two
hour
a
general
though
unexpresse
conviction
that
something
worthy
of
remark
have
happen
that
morning
.
<EOS>
It
have
an
effect
even
upon
the
curate
's
reading
;
and
the
incumbent
,
while
preach
his
sermon
,
could
not
keep
his
eye
off
that
wonderful
bonnet
and
veil
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
next
morning
,
before
eleven
,
Mrs.
Greenow
's
name
be
put
down
at
the
Assembly
Room
.
<EOS>
"
I
need
hardly
say
that
in
my
present
condition
I
care
nothing
for
these
thing
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
would
sooner
be
alone
.
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
Kate
,
I
know
what
I
owe
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Kate
,
with
less
intelligence
than
may
have
be
expect
from
one
so
clever
,
begin
to
assure
her
aunt
that
she
require
no
society
;
and
that
,
come
thus
with
her
to
the
seaside
in
the
early
day
of
her
widowhood
,
she
have
be
well
aware
that
they
would
live
retire
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Greenow
soon
put
her
down
,
and
do
so
without
the
slight
feeling
of
shame
or
annoyance
on
her
own
part
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
"
she
say
,
"
in
this
matter
you
must
let
me
do
what
I
know
to
be
right

<EOS>
I
should
consider
myself
to
be
very
selfish
if
I
allow
my
grief
to
interfere
with
your
amusement

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
aunt

I
do
not
care
for
such
amusement

that
be
nonsense

my
dear

<EOS>
You
ought
to
care
for

how

you
to
settle
yourself
in

if
you
do
not

<EOS>
"
My

I
be
settle

<EOS>
"
settle

say
Mrs.
Greenow
,
astound
,
as
though
there
must
have
be
some
hide
marriage
of
which
she
have
not
hear
.
<EOS>
"
but
that
be
nonsense

<EOS>
of
course
you
be
not
settle

and
how
be
you
to
be
,
if
I
allow
you
to
shut
yourself
up
in
such
a
place
as
this
,
 
just
where
a
girl
have
a
chance
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
that
Kate
try
to
stop
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
easy
to
stop
Mrs.
Greenow
when
she
be
support
by
the
full
assurance
of
be
mistress
of
the
place
and
of
the
occasion

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no

my
dear

I
know
very
well
what
I
owe
to
you

and
I
shall
do
my
duty

<EOS>
as
I
say
before

society
can
have
no
charm
now
for
such
a

I

all
that
social

My
heart
be
desolate

must
remain
so

<EOS>
but
I
be
not
go
to
immolate
you
on
the
altar
of
my
grief

I
shall
force
myself
to
go
out

,
dear

the

will
think
it

so
odd

Mrs.

remark

perhaps
have
be
make
by

People

no

do
remind

Greenow

Mrs.

numerous

come

be
astonish
to
find

many

She
be
indeed
so
bewilder
by

somebody

Mrs.

could
smile
from
beneath

most
bewitching

"
upon
my
word
then
she
be
really
handsome
,
"
Kate
write
one
day
to
Alice

<EOS>
but
she
could
also
frown
,
and
know
well
how
to
put
aside

,
if
need

to
reprobate
any

Captain

indeed

I
do
not
believe
he
be
a

at
all

<EOS>
at
any
rate
he
have
sell
out
,
and
the
tradesman
have
have
a
scramble
for
the
money
.
<EOS>
He
be
only
a
lieutenant
when
the
97th
be
in

I
be
sure
he
be
never
have
a

everybody
here
seem
to

perhaps
they
do
not

much
of
him

I
do

the
idea

have
the
impudence

not

"
I
know
more
than
you
think

my
dear

It
be
my
business

how
could
I
tell
whose
attention
you
should
receive

you

not

I
do

<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
that
Kate
rebel
,
or
attempt
to
rebel
against
this
more
than
maternal
care
.
<EOS>
She
tell
her
aunt
that
she
be
now
nearly
thirty
,
and
that
she
have
manage
her
own
affair
,
at
any
rate
with
safety
,
for
the
last
ten
year
;
 
but
it
be
to
no
purpose

<EOS>
Kate
would
get
angry
;
but
Mrs.
Greenow
never
become
angry
.
<EOS>
Kate
would
be
quite
in
earnest
;
but
Mrs.
Greenow
would
push
aside
all
that
her
niece
say
as
though
it
be
worth
nothing
.
<EOS>
Kate
be
an
unmarried
woman
with
a
very
small
fortune
,
and
therefore
,
of
course
,
be
desirous
of
be
marry
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
.
<EOS>
It
be
natural
that
she
should
deny
that
it
be
so
,
especially
at
this
early
date
in
their
mutual
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
when
the
niece
come
to
know
her
aunt
more
intimately
,
there
may
be
confidence
between
them
,
and
then
they
would
do
better
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Greenow
would
spare
neither
herself
nor
her
purse
on
Kate
's
behalf
,
and
she
would
be
a
dragon
of
watchfulness
in
protect
her
from
the
evil
desire
of
such
useless
man
as
Captain
Bellfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
declare
,

Kate

I
do
not

say
one
morning

her

they
sit
together
over
a
late
breakfast

They
have
fall
into
luxurious

I
be
afraid
it
be
past
eleven
o'clock

although
the
breakfast
thing
be
still
on
the
table

Kate
would
usually
bathe
before
breakfast

Mrs.

be
never
out
of
her
room
till
half
-
past
ten

"
I
like
the
morning
for
contemplation

she
once

when

great

it
be
so
much
more

be
a

pick
up

Kate

<EOS>
then
she
subside
into
her
novel
,
while
Mrs.
Greenow
busy
herself
about
the
good
thing
for
the
picnic
.
<EOS>
in
truth
,
the
aunt
do
not
understand
the
niece
.
<EOS>
whatsoever
may
be
the
fault
of
Kate
Vavasor
,
an
unmaidenly
desire
of
catch
a
husband
for
herself
be
certainly
not
one
of
them
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
 
<EOS>
Yarmouth
be
not
a
happy
place
for
a
picnic
.
<EOS>
a
picnic
should
be
hold
among
green
thing
.
<EOS>
green
turf
be
absolutely
an
essential
.
<EOS>
there
should
be
tree
,
broken
ground
,
small
path
,
thicket
,
and
hide
recess
.
<EOS>
there
should
,
if
possible
,
be
rock
,
old
timber
,
moss
,
and
bramble
.
<EOS>
there
should
certainly
be
hill
and
dale
,
 
on
a
small
scale
;
and
above
all
,
there
should
be
run
water
.
<EOS>
there
should
be
no
expanse
.
<EOS>
Jones
should
not
be
able
to
see
all
Greene
's
movement
,
nor
should
Augusta
always
have
her
eye
upon
her
sister
Jane
.
<EOS>
but
the
spot
choose
for
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
picnic
at
Yarmouth
have
none
of
the
virtue
above
describe
.
<EOS>
It
be
on
the
seashore
.
<EOS>
nothing
be
visible
from
the
site
but
sand
and
sea
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
tree
there
and
nothing
green
;
 
neither
be
there
any
running
water
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
long
,
dry
,
flat
strand
;
there
be
an
old
boat
half
turn
over
,
under
which
it
be
propose
to
dine
;
and
in
addition
to
this
,
bench
,
board
,
and
some
amount
of
canvas
for
shelter
be
provide
by
the
liberality
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
therefore
it
be
call
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
picnic
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
to
be
a
marine
picnic
,
and
therefore
the
essential
attribute
of
other
picnic
be
not
require
.
<EOS>
the
idea
have
come
from
some
boat
expedition
,
in
which
mackerel
have
be
catch
,
and
during
which
food
have
be
eat
,
not
altogether
comfortably
,
in
the
boat
.
<EOS>
then
a
thought
have
suggest
itself
to
Captain
Bellfield
that
they
may
land
and
eat
their
food
,
and
his
friend
Mr.
Cheesacre
have
promise
his
substantial
aid
.
<EOS>
a
lady
have
surmise
that
Ormesby
sand
would
be
the
very
place
for
dance
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
They
may
"
dance
on
the
sand
,
"
she
say
,
"
and
yet
no
footing
see
.
"
<EOS>
and
so
the
thing
have
progress
,
and
the
picnic
be
inaugurate
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
picnic
undoubtedly
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
be
to
supply
the
boat
,
the
wine
,
the
cigar
,
the
music
,
and
the
carpenter
's
work
necessary
for
the
turning
of
the
old
boat
into
a
banqueting
saloon
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Greenow
have
promise
to
provide
the
eatable
,
and
enjoy
as
much
of
the
_
éclat
_
as
the
master
of
the
festival
.
<EOS>
She
have
know
Mr.
Cheesacre
now
for
ten
day
and
be
quite
intimate
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
stout
,
florid
man
,
of
about
forty
-
five
,
a
bachelor
,
apparently
much
attach
to
lady
"
society
,
bear
no
sign
of
age
except
that
he
be
rather
bald
,
and
that
grey
hair
have
mix
themselves
with
his
whisker
,
very
fond
of
his
farming
,
and
yet
somewhat
ashamed
of
it
when
he
find
himself
in
what
he
consider
to
be
polite
circle
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
,
moreover
,
a
little
inclined
to
seek
the
honour
which
come
from
a
well
-
fill
and
liberally
-
open
purse
.
<EOS>
He
like
to
give
a
man
a
dinner
and
then
to
boast
of
the
dinner
he
have
give
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
proud
when
he
could
talk
of
have
mount
,
for
a
day
's
hunting
,
any
man
who
may
be
suppose
to
be
of
high
rank
than
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
Grimsby
with
me
the
other
day
,
 
the
son
of
old
Grimsby
of
Hatherwick
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
bless
if
he
do
not
stake
my
bay
mare
.
<EOS>
but
what
matter
?
<EOS>
I
mount
him
again
the
next
day
just
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
some
people
think
he
be
soft
,
for
it
be
very
well
known
throughout
Norfolk
that
young
Grimsby
would
take
a
mount
wherever
he
could
get
it
.
<EOS>
in
these
day
Mrs.
Greenow
have
become
intimate
with
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
and
have
already
learn
that
he
be
the
undoubted
owner
of
his
own
acre
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
not
do
for
me
,
"
she
have
say
to
him
,
"
to
be
put
myself
forward
,
as
if
I
be
give
a
party
myself
,
or
anything
of
that
sort
;
 
would
it
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
perhaps
not
.
<EOS>
but
you
may
come
with
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
will
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
for
that
dear
girl
's
sake
.
<EOS>
I
should
never
forgive
myself
if
I
debar
her
from
all
the
pleasure
of
youth
,
because
of
my
sorrow
.
<EOS>
I
need
hardly
say
that
at
such
a
time
as
this
nothing
of
that
sort
can
give
me
any
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
,
"
say
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
with
solemn
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
quite
out
of
the
question
.
"
and
Mrs.
Greenow
wipe
away
her
tear
.
<EOS>
"
for
though
as
regard
age
I
may
dance
on
the
sand
as
merrily
as
the
good
of
them
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
I
be
sure
you
could
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
a
woman
to
enjoy
herself
if
her
heart
lie
bury
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
will
not
be
<EOS>
so
always
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
shake
her
head
to
show
that
she
hardly
know
how
to
answer
such
a
question
.
<EOS>
probably
it
would
be
so
always
;
 
but
she
do
not
wish
to
put
a
damper
on
the
present
occasion
by
make
so
sad
a
declaration
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
as
I
be
say
,
"
continue
she
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
and
I
do
it
between
us
will
not
that
be
the
sure
way
of
have
it
come
off
nicely
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
think
that
it
would
be
the
good
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
exactly
so
;
 
I
will
do
the
meat
and
pastry
and
fruit
,
and
you
shall
do
the
boat
and
the
wine
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
the
music
,
"
say
Cheesacre
,
"
and
the
expense
at
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
He
do
not
choose
that
any
part
of
his
outlay
should
go
unnoticed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
half
in
all
that
if
you
like
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Cheesacre
have
decline
this
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
begrudge
the
expense
,
but
only
wish
that
it
should
be
recognise
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
"
continue
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
mean
to
send
the
music
;
I
do
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
hear
of
it
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
mention
it
now
,
because
I
be
think
of
get
Blowehard
to
come
.
<EOS>
that
other
man
,
Flutey
,
would
not
do
at
all
out
in
the
open
air
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
Blowehard
,
"
say
Mr.
Cheesacre
;
and
it
be
Blowehard
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
like
to
have
her
own
way
in
these
little
thing
,
though
her
heart
do
lie
bury
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
morning
of
the
picnic
Mr.
Cheesacre
come
down
to
Montpelier
Parade
with
Captain
Bellfield
,
whose
linen
on
that
occasion
certainly
give
no
outward
sign
of
any
quarrel
between
him
and
his
washerwoman
.
<EOS>
He
be
get
up
wonderfully
,
and
be
prepare
at
all
point
for
the
day
's
work
.
<EOS>
He
have
on
a
pseudo
-
sailor
's
jacket
,
very
liberally
ornament
with
brass
button
,
which
display
with
great
judgement
the
exquisite
shape
of
his
pseudo
-
sailor
's
duck
trouser
.
<EOS>
beneath
them
there
be
a
pair
of
very
shiny
patent
-
leather
shoe
,
well
adapt
for
dance
on
the
sand
,
presume
him
to
be
anxious
of
do
so
,
as
Venus
offer
to
do
,
without
leave
any
footmark
.
<EOS>
His
waistcoat
be
of
a
delicate
white
fabric
,
ornament
with
very
many
gilt
button
.
<EOS>
He
have
bejewel
stud
in
his
shirt
,
and
yellow
kid
glove
on
his
hand
;
have
,
of
course
,
another
pair
in
his
pocket
for
the
necessity
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
His
array
be
quite
perfect
,
and
have
stricken
dismay
into
the
heart
of
his
friend
Cheesacre
,
when
he
join
that
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
well
-
make
man
,
nearly
six
foot
high
,
with
dark
hair
,
dark
whisker
,
and
dark
moustache
,
nearly
black
,
but
of
that
suspicious
hue
which
to
the
observant
beholder
seem
always
to
tell
a
tale
of
the
hairdresser
's
shop
.
<EOS>
He
be
handsome
,
too
,
with
well
-
arrange
feature
,
 
but
carry
,
perhaps
,
in
his
nose
some
first
symptom
of
the
effect
of
midnight
amusement
.
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
however
,
he
be
a
nice
man
to
look
at
 
for
those
who
like
to
look
on
nice
man
of
that
kind
.
  
<EOS>
cheesacre
,
too
,
have
adopt
something
of
a
sailor
's
garb
.
<EOS>
He
have
on
a
jacket
of
a
rough
sort
,
come
down
much
low
than
that
of
the
captain
,
be
much
loose
,
and
perhaps
somewhat
more
like
a
garment
which
a
possible
seaman
may
possibly
wear
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
disgusted
with
himself
the
moment
that
he
see
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
His
heart
have
be
faint
,
and
he
have
not
dare
to
ornament
himself
boldly
as
his
friend
have
do
.
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
guss
,
you
be
a
swell
,
"
he
exclaim
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
explain
that
Captain
Bellfield
have
be
christen
Gustavus
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
much
about
that
,
"
say
the
captain
;
"
my
fellow
send
me
this
toggery
,
and
say
that
it
be
the
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
I
will
change
with
you
if
you
like
it
.
"
<EOS>
but
Cheesacre
could
not
have
wear
that
jacket
,
and
he
walk
on
,
hate
himself
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
be
remember
that
Mrs.
Greenow
have
speak
with
considerable
severity
of
Captain
Bellfield
's
pretension
when
discuss
his
character
with
her
niece
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
on
the
present
occasion
she
receive
him
with
most
gracious
smile
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
her
estimate
of
his
character
have
be
alter
,
or
that
she
be
make
sacrifice
of
her
own
feeling
in
consideration
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
who
be
know
to
be
the
captain
's
intimate
friend
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
smile
for
both
of
them
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
wondrous
power
of
smile
;
and
could
,
upon
occasion
,
give
sign
of
peculiar
favour
to
half
a
dozen
different
gentleman
in
as
many
minute
.
<EOS>
They
find
her
in
the
midst
of
hamper
which
be
not
yet
wholly
pack
,
while
Mrs.
Jones
,
Jeannette
,
and
the
cook
of
the
household
move
around
her
,
on
the
outside
of
the
circle
,
minister
to
her
want
.
<EOS>
She
have
in
her
hand
an
outspread
clean
napkin
,
and
she
wear
fasten
round
her
dress
a
huge
coarse
apron
,
that
she
may
thus
be
protect
from
some
possible
ebullition
of
gravy
,
or
escape
of
salad
mixture
,
or
cream
;
but
in
other
respect
she
be
clothe
in
the
full
honour
of
widowhood
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
mitigate
her
weed
by
half
an
inch
.
<EOS>
She
have
scorn
to
make
any
compromise
between
the
world
of
pleasure
and
the
world
of
woe
.
<EOS>
there
she
be
,
a
widow
,
declare
by
herself
to
be
of
four
month
"
standing
,
with
a
bury
heart
,
make
ready
a
dainty
banquet
with
skill
and
liberality
.
<EOS>
She
be
ready
on
the
instant
to
sit
down
upon
the
basket
in
which
the
grouse
pie
have
be
just
carefully
inhume
,
and
talk
about
her
sainted
lamb
with
a
deluge
of
tear
.
<EOS>
if
anybody
do
not
like
it
,
that
person
 
may
do
the
other
thing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
and
Captain
Bellfield
think
that
they
do
like
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
if
you
have
not
catch
me
before
I
have
half
do
!
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
,
I
hope
you
think
my
apron
become
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
everything
that
you
wear
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
be
always
become
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
talk
in
that
way
when
you
know
 
;
but
never
mind
 
we
will
think
of
nothing
sad
to
-
day
if
we
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
Will
we
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
<EOS>
no
<EOS>
;
I
should
think
not
;
 
unless
it
should
come
on
to
rain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
rain
 
we
will
not
think
of
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
but
,
by
the
by
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
I
and
my
niece
do
mean
to
send
out
a
few
thing
,
just
in
a
bag
you
know
,
so
that
we
may
tidy
ourselves
up
a
little
after
the
sea
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
it
mention
,
because
if
it
get
about
among
the
other
lady
,
they
would
think
we
want
to
make
a
dressing
of
it
;
 
and
there
would
not
be
room
for
them
all
;
would
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
there
would
not
,
"
say
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
who
have
be
out
on
the
previous
evening
,
inspect
,
and
perhaps
limit
,
the
carpenter
in
their
work
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
just
it
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
but
there
will
not
be
any
harm
,
will
there
,
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
in
Jeanette
be
go
out
with
our
thing
?
<EOS>
She
will
ride
in
the
cart
,
you
know
,
with
the
eatable
.
<EOS>
I
know
Jeannette
be
a
friend
of
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
delighted
to
have
Jeanette
,
"
say
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
"
thank
ye
,
sir
,
"
say
Jeannette
,
with
a
curtsey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jeannette
,
do
not
you
let
Mr.
Cheesacre
turn
your
head
;
and
mind
you
behave
yourself
and
be
useful
.
<EOS>
well
;
let
me
see
;
 
what
else
be
there
?
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jones
,
you
may
as
well
give
me
that
ham
now
.
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
,
hand
it
over
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
put
it
into
the
basket
,
because
you
would
turn
it
the
wrong
side
down
.
<EOS>
there
now
,
if
you
have
not
nearly
make
me
upset
the
apricot
pie
.
"
<EOS>
then
,
in
the
transfer
of
the
dish
between
the
captain
and
the
widow
,
there
occur
some
little
innocent
by
-
play
,
which
seem
to
give
offence
to
Mr.
Cheesacre
;
so
that
that
gentleman
turn
his
back
upon
the
hamper
and
take
a
step
away
towards
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
see
the
thing
at
a
glance
,
and
immediately
apply
herself
to
cure
the
wound
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
"
say
she
,
"
Kate
would
not
come
down
because
she
do
not
choose
that
you
should
see
her
with
an
apron
on
over
her
frock
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
do
not
know
why
Miss
Vavasor
should
care
about
my
see
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
nor
I
either
.
<EOS>
that
be
just
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
do
step
up
into
the
drawing
-
room
;
you
will
find
her
there
,
and
you
can
make
her
answer
for
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
not
come
down
for
me
,
"
say
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
stir
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
be
not
willing
to
leave
his
friend
with
the
widow
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
the
last
of
the
dish
be
pack
and
Mrs.
Greenow
go
up
-
stair
with
the
two
gentleman
.
<EOS>
there
they
find
Kate
and
two
or
three
other
lady
who
have
promise
to
embark
under
the
protection
of
Mrs.
Greenow
's
wing
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
two
Miss
Fairstairs
,
whom
Mrs.
Greenow
have
especially
patronize
,
and
who
repay
that
lady
for
her
kindness
by
an
amount
of
outspoken
eulogy
which
startle
Kate
by
its
audacity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
dear
aunt
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fanny
Fairstairs
have
say
on
come
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
I
ever
come
across
a
woman
with
such
genuine
milk
of
human
kindness
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nor
with
so
much
true
wit
,
"
say
her
sister
Charlotte
,
 
who
have
be
call
Charlie
on
the
sand
of
Yarmouth
for
the
last
twelve
year
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
widow
come
into
the
room
,
they
fly
at
her
and
devour
her
with
kiss
,
and
swear
that
they
have
never
see
her
look
so
well
.
<EOS>
but
as
the
bright
new
glove
which
both
the
girl
wear
have
be
present
from
Mrs.
Greenow
,
they
certainly
do
owe
her
some
affection
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
many
lady
who
would
venture
to
bestow
such
gift
upon
their
friend
after
so
very
short
an
acquaintance
;
but
Mrs.
Greenow
have
a
power
that
be
quite
her
own
in
such
matter
.
<EOS>
She
be
already
on
a
very
confidential
footing
with
the
Miss
Fairstairs
,
and
have
give
them
much
useful
advice
as
to
their
future
prospect
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
be
there
a
Mrs.
Green
,
whose
husband
be
first
-
lieutenant
on
board
a
man
-
of
-
war
on
the
West
Indian
Station
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Green
be
a
quiet
,
ladylike
little
woman
,
rather
pretty
,
very
silent
,
and
,
as
one
would
have
think
,
hardly
adapt
for
the
special
intimacy
of
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Greenow
have
find
out
that
she
be
alone
,
not
very
rich
,
and
in
want
of
the
solace
of
society
.
<EOS>
therefore
she
have
,
from
sheer
good
-
nature
,
force
herself
upon
Mrs.
Green
,
and
<EOS>
Mrs.
Green
,
with
much
trepidation
,
have
consent
to
be
take
to
the
picnic
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
your
husband
would
like
it
,
"
Mrs.
Greenow
have
say
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
hope
I
may
live
to
tell
him
that
I
make
you
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
come
in
also
a
brother
of
the
Fairstairs
girl
,
Joe
Fairstairs
,
a
lanky
,
useless
,
idle
young
man
,
young
than
them
,
who
be
suppose
to
earn
his
bread
in
an
attorney
's
office
at
Norwich
,
or
rather
to
be
prepare
to
earn
it
at
some
future
time
,
and
who
be
a
heavy
burden
upon
all
his
friend
.
<EOS>
"
We
tell
Joe
to
come
to
the
house
,
"
say
Fanny
to
the
widow
,
apologetically
,
"
because
we
think
he
may
be
useful
in
carry
down
the
cloak
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
smile
graciously
upon
Joe
,
and
assure
him
that
she
be
charm
to
see
him
,
without
any
reference
to
such
service
as
those
mention
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
they
start
.
<EOS>
when
they
get
to
the
door
both
Cheesacre
and
the

make
an
attempt
to
get
possession
of
the
widow
's
arm

<EOS>
but
she
have
it
all
arrange
.
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
find
himself
constrain
to
attend
to
Mrs.
Green
,
while
Mr.
Cheesacre
walk
down
to
the
beach
beside
Kate
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
your
arm
,
Mr.
Joe
,
"
say
the
widow
,
"
and
the
girl
shall
come
with
us
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
when
they
get
to
the
boat
,
round
which
the
other
comer
to
the
picnic
be
already
assemble
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
 
although
both
the
boat
be
for
the
day
his
own
,
 
find
himself
separate
from
the
widow
.
<EOS>
He
get
into
that
which
contain
Kate
Vavasor
,
and
be
shove
off
from
the
beach
while
he
see
Captain
Bellfield
arrange
Mrs.
Greenow
's
drapery
.
<EOS>
He
have
declare
to
himself
that
it
should
be
otherwise
;
and
that
as
he
have
to
pay
the
piper
,
the
piper
should
play
as
he
like
it
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Greenow
with
a
word
or
two
have
settle
it
all
,
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
have
find
himself
to
be
powerless
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
absurd
Bellfield
look
in
that
jacket
,
do
not
he
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
to
Kate
,
as
he
take
his
seat
in
the
boat
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
so
very
pretty
and
become
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
hate
Captain
Bellfield
,
and
regret
more
than
ever
that
he
have
not
do
something
for
his
own
personal
adornment
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
endure
to
think
that
his
friend
,
who
pay
for
nothing
,
should
carry
away
the
honour
of
the
morning
and
defraud
him
of
the
delight
which
should
justly
belong
to
him
,
"
It
may
be
become
,
"
say
Cheesacre
;
"
but
do
not
you
think
it
be
awfully
extravagant
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
to
that
I
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
You
see
I
do
not
at
all
know
what
be
the
price
of
a
jacket
cover
all
over
with
little
brass
button
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
the
waistcoat
,
Miss
Vavasor
!
"
say
Cheesacre
,
almost
solemnly
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
waistcoat
I
should
think
must
have
be
expensive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
dreadful
!
<EOS>
and
he
be
get
nothing
,
Miss
Vavasor
;
literally
nothing
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
"
 
<EOS>
and
he
reduce
his
voice
to
a
whisper
as
he
make
this
communication
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
lend
him
twenty
pound
the
day
before
yesterday
;
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
mention
it
again
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
because
,
as
you
be
see
a
good
deal
of
him
just
now
,
I
think
it
right
that
you
should
know
on
what
sort
of
a
footing
he
stand
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
fair
,
they
say
,
in
love
and
war
,
and
this
small
breach
of
confidence
be
,
we
must
presume
,
a
love
stratagem
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
He
be
at
this
time
smitten
with
the
charm
both
of
the
widow
and
of
the
niece
,
and
he
constantly
find
that
the
captain
be
interfere
with
him
on
whichever
side
he
turn
himself
.
<EOS>
on
the
present
occasion
he
have
desire
to
take
the
widow
for
his
share
,
and
be
,
upon
the
whole
,
inclined
to
think
that
the
widow
be
the
more
worthy
of
his
attention
.
<EOS>
He
have
make
certain
little
inquiry
within
the
last
day
or
two
,
the
answer
to
which
have
be
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
these
he
have
by
no
mean
communicate
to
his
friend
,
to
whom
,
indeed
,
he
have
express
an
opinion
that
Mrs.
Greenow
be
after
all
only
a
flash
in
the
pan
.
<EOS>
"
She
do
very
well
pour
passer
le
temps
,
"
the
captain
have
answer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
have
not
quite
understand
the
exact
gist
of
the
captain
's
meaning
,
but
have
feel
certain
that
his
friend
be
play
him
false
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
it
to
be
mention
again
,
Miss
Vavasor

"
he
continue
.
  
<EOS>
"
such
thing
should
not
be
mention
at
all
,
"
Kate
reply
,
have
be
anger
at
the
insinuation
that
the
nature
of
Captain
Bellfield
's
footing
could
be
a
matter
of
any
moment
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
they
should
not
;
and
therefore
I
know
that
I
be
quite
safe
with
you
,
Miss
Vavasor

<EOS>
He
be
a
very
pleasant
fellow
,
very
;
and
have
see
the
world
,
 
uncommon
;
but
he
be
well
for
eat
and
drink
with
than
he
be
for
buy

sell
with
,
as
we
say
in
Norfolk

do
you
like
Norfolk
,
Miss
Vavasor

I
never

only
see
Yarmouth

<EOS>
"
a
nice
place
,
Yarmouth
,
very
;
but
you
should
come
up
and
see
our
land

I
suppose
you
do
not

that
we
feed
one

third
of
England
during
the
winter
month

dear
me
!

<EOS>
"
We
do
,
though
;
nobody
know
what
a
county
Norfolk
be
.
<EOS>
take
it
altogether
,
include
the
game
you
know
,
and
Lord
Nelson
,
and
its
watering
-
place
and
the
rest
of
it
,
I
do
not

there
be
a
county
in
England
to
beat
it

<EOS>
fancy
feed
one

third
of
all
England

Wales

with
bread

do
you
mean
,

those
sort
of
thing
?

<EOS>
"
beef
!
"
say
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
and
in
his
patriotic
energy
he
repeat
the
word
aloud
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
beef
!
<EOS>
yes
indeed
;
but
if
you
be
to
tell
them
that
in
London
they
would
not
believe
you
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
you
should
certainly
come
down
and
see
our
land
.
<EOS>
the
7.45
A.M.
train
would
take
you
through
Norwich
to
my
door
,
as
one
may
say
,
and
you
would
be
back
by
the
6.22
P.M.
<EOS>
"
in
this
way
he
bring
himself
back
again
into
good
-
humour
,
feeling
,
that
in
the
absence
of
the
widow
,
he
could
not
do
better
than
make
progress
with
the
niece
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
Mrs.
Greenow
and
the
captain
be
get
on
very
comfortably
in
the
other
boat
.
<EOS>
"
take
an
oar
,
captain
,
"
one
of
the
man
have
say
to
him
as
soon
as
he

"
the
good
thing
as
the
bo'san

to
pipe

the
man
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
be
behind
in
that
either
,
"

the
captain
;

so
they
all
go
on
swimmingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
fine
generous
fellow
your
friend
,
Mr.

be
!

say
the
widow

<EOS>
"
yes
,
he
be
;
he
be
a
capital
fellow

<EOS>
some
of
these
Norfolk
farmer
be
no
end
of
good
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
suppose
he
be
something
more
than
a
common
farmer
.
<EOS>
He
be
visit
by
the
people
about
where
he
live
,
be
not
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
in
a
sort
of
a
way
.
<EOS>
the
county
people
,
you
know
,
keep
themselves
very
much
to
themselves
.

<EOS>
"
that
be
of
course

his
house

he
have
a
good

of
place
,
have
not
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
;
 
a
very
good
house
;
 
a
little
too
near
to
the
horse
-
pond
for
my
taste
.
<EOS>
but
when
a
man
get
his
money
out
of
the
till
,
he
must
not
be
ashamed
of
the
counter
;
 
must
he
,
Mrs.
Greenow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
he
could
live
like
a
gentleman
if
he
let
his
own
land
,
could
not
he
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
depend
upon
how
a
gentleman
wish
to
live
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
the
privacy
of
their
conversation
be
interrupt
by
an
exclamation
from
a
young
lady
to
the
effect
that
Charlie
Fairstairs
be
become
sick
.
<EOS>
this
Charlie
stoutly
deny
,
and
prove
the
truth
of
her
assertion
by
her
behaviour
.
<EOS>
soon
after
this
they
complete
their
marine
adventure
,
and
prepare
to
land
close
to
the
spot
at
which
the
banquet
be
prepare
.
   
<EOS>
the
Rivals
.
 
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
pretence
of
fishing
,
but
no
fish
have
be
catch
.
<EOS>
It
be
soon
find
that
such
an
amusement
would
interfere
with
the
lady
"
dress
,
and
the
affair
have
become
too
serious
to
allow
of
any
trivial
interruption
.
<EOS>
"
I
really
think
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
"
an
anxious
mother
have
say
,
"
that
you
would
better
give
it
up
.
<EOS>
the
water
off
the
nasty
cord
have
get
all
over
Maria
's
dress
,
already
.
<EOS>
"
Maria
make
a
faint
protest
that
it
do
not
signify
in
the
least
;
but
the
fishing
be
give
up
,
 
not
without
an
inward
feeling
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
that
if
Maria
choose
to
come
out
with
him
in
his
boat
,
have
be
invite
especially
to
fish
,
she
ought
to
have
put
up
with
the
natural
result
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
people
who
like
to
take
everything
and
never
like
to
give
anything
,
"
he
say
to
Kate
afterwards
,
as
he
be
walk
up
with
her
to
the
picnic
dinner
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
unreasonable
and
unjust
.
<EOS>
the
girl
have
grace
his
party
with
their
good
hat
and
freshest
muslin
,
not
that
they
may
see
him
catch
a
mackerel
,
but
that
they
may
flirt
and
dance
to
the
good
advantage
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
suppose
that
any
girl
will
like
to
be
drench
with
sea
-
water
when
she
have
take
so
much
trouble
with
her
starch
,
"
say
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
then
she
should
not
come
fish
,
"
say
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
I
hate
such
air
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
when
they
arrive
at
the
old
boat
,
Mrs.
Greenow
shine
forth
pre
-
eminently
as
the
mistress
of
the
occasion
,
altogether
overshadow
Mr.
Cheesacre
by
the
extent
of
her
authority
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
contest
for
supremacy
between
them
,
invisible
to
the
eye
of
the
multitude
;
but
Mr.
Cheesacre
in
such
a
matter
have
not
a
chance
against
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
I
be
dispose
to
think
that
she
would
have
reign
even
though
she
have
not
contribute
to
the
eatable
;
but
with
that
point
in
her
favour
,
she
be
able
to
make
herself
supreme
.
<EOS>
Jeannette
,
too
,
be
her
servant
,
which
be
a
great
thing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
soon
give
way
;
and
though
he
bustle
about
and
be
conspicuous
,
he
bustle
about
in
obedience
to
order
receive
,
and
become
a
head
servant
.
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
also
make
himself
useful
,
but
he
drive
Mr.
Cheesacre
into
paroxysm
of
suppress
anger
by
give
direction
,
and
by
have
those
direction
obey
.
<EOS>
a
man
to
whom
he
have
lend
twenty
pound
the
day
before
yesterday
,
and
who
have
not
contribute
so
much
as
a
bottle
of
champagne
!
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
to
dine
at
four
,
and
now
it
be
half
-
past
three
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
,
address
herself
to
the
multitude
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
to
begin
to
dance
at
six
,
"
say
an
eager
young
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
Maria
,
hold
your
tongue
,
"
say
the
young
lady
's
mother

<EOS>
"
yes
,
we
will
dine
at
four

say
Mr.
Cheesacre

<EOS>
"
and
as
for
the
music
,
I
have
order
it
to
be
here
punctual
at
half
-
past
five

We
be
to
have
three
horn
,
cymbal
,
triangle
,
and
a
drum

"
  
<EOS>

how
very
nice
;
be
not
it
,
Mrs.
Greenow
?
"
say
Charlie
Fairstairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
suppose
we
begin
to
unpack
,
"
say
Captain
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
"
half
the
fun
be
in
arrange
the
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
dear
,
yes
;
more
than
half
,
"
say
Fanny
Fairstairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bellfield
,
do
not
mind
about
the
hamper
,
"
say
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
wine
be
a
ticklish
thing
to
handle
,
and
there
be
my
man
there
to
manage
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
odd
if
I
do
not
know
more
about
wine
than
the
boot
from
the
hotel
,
"
say
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
this
allusion
to
the
boot
almost
cow
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
and
make
him
turn
away
,
leave
Bellfield
with
the
widow
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
unpacking
,
during
which
Captain
Bellfield
and
Mrs.
Greenow
constantly
have
their
head
in
the
same
hamper
.
<EOS>
I
by
no
means
intend
to
insinuate
that
there
be
anything
wrong
in
this
.
<EOS>
People
engage
together
in
unpack
pie
and
cold
chicken
must
have
their
head
in
the
same
hamper
.
<EOS>
but
a
great
intimacy
be
thereby
produce
,
and
the
widow
seem
to
have
lay
aside
altogether
that
prejudice
of
hers
with
reference
to
the
washerwoman
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
long
table
place
on
the
sand
,
shelter
by
the
upturned
boat
from
the
land
side
,
but
open
towards
the
sea
,
and
over
this
,
support
on
pole
,
there
be
an
awning
.
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
the
arrangement
be
not
an
uncomfortable
one
for
people
who
have
select
so
very
uncomfortable
a
dining
-
room
as
the
sand
of
the
sea
-
shore
.
<EOS>
much
be
certainly
due
to
Mr.
Cheesacre
for
the
expenditure
he
have
incur
,
 
and
something
perhaps
to
Captain
Bellfield
for
his
ingenuity
in
have
suggest
it
.
  
<EOS>
now
come
the
placing
of
the
guest
for
dinner
,
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
make
another
great
effort
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
,
"
he
say
,
aloud
,
"
<EOS>
Bellfield
and
<EOS>
I
will
take
the
two
end
of
the
table
,
and
Mrs.
Greenow
shall
sit
at
my
right
hand
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
not
only
boldly
do
,
but
there
be
a
propriety
in
it
which
at
first
sight
seem
to
be
irresistible
.
<EOS>
much
as
he
have
hate
and
do
hate
the
captain
,
he
have
skilfully
make
the
proposition
in
such
a
way
as
to
flatter
him
,
and
it
seem
for
a
few
moment
as
though
he
be
go
to
have
it
all
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
but
Captain
Bellfield
be
not
a
man
to
submit
to
defeat
in
such
a
matter
as
this
without
an
effort
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
that
will
do
,
"
say
he
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
give
the
dinner
,
and
Cheesacre
give
the
wine
.
<EOS>
We
must
have
them
at
the
two
end
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
Mrs.
Greenow
will
not
refuse
to
allow
me
to
hand
her
to
the
place
which
belong
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
will
sit
at
her
right
hand
and
be
her
minister
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
do
not
refuse
,
 
and
so
the
matter
be
adjust
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
take
his
seat
in
despair
.
<EOS>
It
be
nothing
to
him
that
he
have
Kate
Vavasor
at
his
left
hand
.
<EOS>
He
like
talk
to
Kate
very
well
,
but
he
could
not
enjoy
that
pleasure
while
Captain
Bellfield
be
in
the
very
act
of
make
progress
with
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
one
would
think
that
he
have
give
it
himself
;
would
not
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
to
Maria
's
mother
,
who
sit
at
his
right
hand
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
do
not
in
the
least
understand
him
.
"
<EOS>
give
what
?
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
the
music
and
the
wine
and
all
the
rest
of
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
people
full
of
that
kind
of
impudence
.
<EOS>
how
they
manage
to
carry
it
on
without
ever
pay
a
shilling
,
I
never
could
tell
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
have
to
pay
my
way
,
and
something
over
and
beyond
generally
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Maria
's
mother
say
,
"
yes
,
indeed
.
"
<EOS>
She
have
other
daughter
there
besides
Maria
,
and
be
look
down
the
table
to
see
whether
they
be
judiciously
place
.
<EOS>
Her
beauty
,
her
young
one
,
Ophelia
,
be
sit
next
to
that
ne'er
-
do
-
well
Joe
Fairstairs
,
and
this
make
her
unhappy
.
<EOS>
"
Ophelia
,
my
dear
,
you
be
dreadfully
in
the
draught
;
there
be
a
seat
up
here
,
just
opposite
,
where
you
will
be
more
comfortable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
draught
here
,
mamma
,
"
say
Ophelia
,
without
the
slight
sign
of
move
.
<EOS>
perhaps
Ophelia
like
the
society
of
that
lanky
,
idle
,
useless
young
man
.
  
<EOS>
the
mirth
of
the
table
certainly
come
from
Mrs.
Greenow
's
end
.
<EOS>
the
widow
have
hardly
take
her
place
before
she
get
up
again
and
change
with
the
captain
.
<EOS>
It
be
find
that
the
captain
could
better
carve
the
great
grouse
pie
from
the
end
than
from
the
side
.
<EOS>
Cheesacre
,
when
he
see
this
,
absolutely
throw
down
his
knife
and
fork
violently
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
be
anything
the
matter
?
"
say
Maria
's
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
matter
!
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
then
he
shake
his
head
in
grief
of
heart
and
vexation
of
spirit
,
and
resume
his
knife
and
fork
.
<EOS>
Kate
watch
it
all
,
and
be
greatly
amuse
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
see
a
man
so
nearly
break
-
hearted
,
"
she
say
,
in
her
letter
to
Alice
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
"
eleven
,
thirteen
,
eighteen
,
twenty
-
one
,
"
say
Cheesacre
to
himself
,
reckon
up
in
his
misery
the
number
of
pound
sterling
which
he
would
have
to
pay
for
be
ill
-
treat
in
this
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
lady
and
gentleman
,
"
say
Captain
Bellfield
,
as
soon
as
the
eating
be
over
,
"
if
I
may
be
permit
to
get
upon
my
leg
for
two
minute
,
I
be
go
to
propose
a
toast
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
real
patron
of
the
feast
have
actually
not
yet
swallow
his
last
bit
of
cheese
.
<EOS>
the
thing
be
indecent
in
the
violence
of
its
injustice
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
please
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
"
say
the
patron
,
indifferent
to
the
cheese
in
his
throat
,
"
I
will
propose
the
toast
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
nothing
on
earth
could
be
well
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
say
the
captain
,
"
and
I
be
sure
I
should
be
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
take
the
job
out
of
the
hand
of
one
who
would
do
it
so
much
well
than
I
can
;
but
as
it
be
your
health
that
we
be
go
to
drink
,
I
really
do
not
see
how
you
be
to
do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Cheesacre
grunt
and
sit
down
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
could
not
propose
his
own
health
,
nor
do
he
complain
of
the
honour
that
be
to
be
do
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
proper
that
his
health
should
be
drunk
,
and
he
have
now
to
think
of
the
word
in
which
he
would
return
thank
.
<EOS>
but
the
extent
of
his
horror
may
be
imagine
when
Bellfield
get
up
and
make
a
most
brilliant
speech
in
praise
of
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
for
full
five
minute
he
go
on
without
mention
the
name
of
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
yarmouth
,
he
say
,
have
never
in
his
day
be
so
blessed
as
it
have
be
this
year
by
the
presence
of
the
lady
who
be
now
with
them
.
<EOS>
She
have
come
among
them
,
he
declare
,
forgetful
of
herself
and
of
her
great
sorrow
,
with
the
sole
desire
of
add
something
to
the
happiness
of
other
.
<EOS>
then
Mrs.
Greenow
have
take
out
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
sweep
back
the
broad
ribbon
of
her
cap
over
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
altogether
the
scene
be
very
affecting
,
and
Cheesacre
be
drive
to
madness
.
<EOS>
They
be
the
very
word
that
he
have
intend
to
speak
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
all
this
kind
of
thing
,
"
he
say
to
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
so
fulsome
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
after
-
dinner
speech
never
mean
anything
,
"
say
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
when
Bellfield
have
come
to
an
end
of
praise
Mrs.
Greenow
,
he
tell
the
guest
that
he
wish
to
join
his
friend
Mr.
Cheesacre
in
the
toast
,
the
more
so
as
it
could
hardly
be
hope
that
Mrs.
Greenow
would
herself
rise
to
return
thank
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
well
fellow
than
his
friend
Cheesacre
,
whom
he
have
know
for
he
would
not
say
how
many
year
.
<EOS>
He
be
quite
sure
they
would
all
have
the
most
sincere
pleasure
in
join
the
health
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
with
that
of
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
a
clattering
of
glass
and
a
murmuring
of
health
,
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
slowly
get
upon
his
leg
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
much
oblige
to
this
company
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
to
my
friend
Bellfield
,
who
really
be
,
 
<EOS>
but
perhaps
that
do
not
signify
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
the
great
pleasure
in
get
up
this
little
thing
,
and
I
would
make
up
my
mind
to
propose
Mrs.
Greenow
's
health
;
but
,
h'm
,
ha
,
no
doubt
it
have
be
in
well
hand
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
consider
all
thing
,
Bellfield
may
have
wait
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
with
such
a
subject
on
my
hand
,
I
could
not
wait
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
interrupt
you
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
and
<EOS>
perhaps
you
will
let
me
go
on
without
interrupt
me
.
<EOS>
We
have
all
drunk
Mrs.
Greenow
's
health
,
and
I
be
sure
she
be
very
much
oblige
.
<EOS>
so
be
I
for
the
honour
you
have
do
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
take
some
trouble
in
get
up
this
little
thing
,
and
I
hope
you
like
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
somebody
say
something
about
liberality
.
<EOS>
I
beg
to
assure
you
that
I
do
not
think
of
that
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
somebody
must
pay
for
these
sort
of
thing
,
and
I
be
always
very
glad
to
take
my
turn
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
Bellfield
will
give
us
the
next
picnic
,
and
if
he
will
appoint
a
day
before
the
end
of
the
month
,
I
shall
be
happy
to
be
one
of
the
party
.
"
<EOS>
then
he
sit
down
with
some
inward
satisfaction
,
fully
convinced
that
he
have
give
his
enemy
a
fatal
blow
.
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
on
earth
would
give
me
so
much
pleasure
,
"
say
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
after
that
he
turn
again
to
Mrs.
Greenow
and
go
on
with
his
private
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
more
speak
,
nor
be
there
much
time
for
other
after
-
dinner
ceremony
.
<EOS>
the
three
horn
,
the
cymbal
,
the
triangle
,
and
the
drum
be
soon
hear
tuning
-
up
behind
the
banqueting
-
hall
,
and
the
lady
go
to
the
further
end
of
the
old
boat
to
make
their
preparation
for
the
dance
.
<EOS>
then
it
be
that
the
thoughtful
care
of
Mrs.
Greenow
,
in
have
send
Jeannette
with
brush
,
comb
,
clean
handkerchief
,
and
other
little
knick
-
knackerie
,
become
so
apparent
.
<EOS>
It
be
say
that
the
widow
herself
actually
change
her
cap
,
 
which
be
consider
by
some
to
be
very
unfair
,
as
there
have
be
an
understanding
that
there
should
be
no
dressing
.
<EOS>
on
such
occasion
lady
be
generally
willing
to
forego
the
advantage
of
dress
on
the
condition
that
other
lady
shall
forego
the
same
advantage
;
but
when
this
compact
be
break
by
any
special
lady
,
the
treason
be
think
to
be
very
treacherous
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
though
a
fencer
should
remove
the
button
from
the
end
of
his
foil
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Greenow
be
so
good
-
natured
in
tender
the
service
of
Jeannette
to
all
the
young
lady
,
and
be
so
willing
to
share
with
other
those
good
thing
of
the
toilet
which
her
care
have
provide
,
that
her
cap
be
forgive
her
by
the
most
of
those
present
.
  
<EOS>
when
lady
have
make
up
their
mind
to
dance
they
will
dance
let
the
circumstance
of
the
moment
be
ever
so
antagonistic
to
that
exercise
.
<EOS>
a
ploughed
field
in
February
would
not
be
too
wet
,
nor
the
side
of
a
house
too
uneven
.
<EOS>
in
honest
truth
the
sand
of
the
seashore
be
not
adapt
for
the
exercise
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
very
well
for
Venus
to
make
the
promise
,
but
when
make
it
she
know
that
Adonis
would
not
keep
her
to
her
word
.
<EOS>
let
any
lightest
-
limbe
nymph
try
it
,
and
she
will
find
that
she
leave
most
palpable
footing
.
<EOS>
the
sand
in
question
be
doubtless
compact
,
firm
,
and
sufficiently
moist
to
make
walk
on
them
comfortable
;
but
they
ruffle
themselves
most
uncomfortably
under
the
unwonted
pressure
to
which
they
be
subject
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
our
friend
do
dance
on
the
sand
;
finding
,
however
,
that
quadrille
and
Sir
Roger
de
Coverley
suit
them
better
than
polkas
and
waltz
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
my
friend
,
no
,
"
Mrs.
Greenow
say
to
Mr.
Cheesacre
when
that
gentleman
endeavour
to
persuade
her
to
stand
up
;
"
Kate
will
be
delighted
I
be
sure
to
join
you
,
 
<EOS>
but
as
for
me
,
you
must
excuse
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Cheesacre
be
not
incline
at
that
moment
to
ask
Kate
Vavasor
to
dance
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
possess
by
an
undefined
idea
that
Kate
have
snub
him
,
and
as
Kate
's
fortune
be
,
as
he
say
,
literally
nothing
,
he
be
not
at
all
dispose
to
court
her
favour
at
the
expense
of
such
suffering
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
quite
sure
that
I
will
dance
myself
,
"
say
he
,
seat
himself
in
a
corner
of
the
tent
by
Mrs.
Greenow
's
side
.
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
at
that
moment
be
see
lead
Miss
Vavasor
away
to
a
new
place
on
the
sand
,
whither
he
be
follow
by
a
score
of
dancer
;
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
see
that
now
at
last
he
may
reap
the
reward
for
which
he
have
labour
.
<EOS>
He
be
alone
with
the
widow
,
and
have
be
make
bold
by
wine
,
have
an
opportunity
of
fight
his
battle
,
than
which
none
better
could
ever
be
find
.
<EOS>
He
be
himself
by
no
mean
a
poor
man
,
and
he
despise
poverty
in
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
that
there
should
be
poor
gentry
,
in
order
that
they
may
act
as
satellite
to
those
who
,
like
himself
,
have
money
.
<EOS>
as
to
Mrs.
Greenow
's
money
,
there
be
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
He
know
it
all
to
a
fraction
.
<EOS>
She
have
spread
for
herself
,
or
some
one
else
have
spread
for
her
,
a
report
that
her
wealth
be
almost
unlimited
;
but
the
forty
thousand
pound
be
a
fact
,
and
any
such
innocent
fault
as
that
little
fiction
may
well
be
forgive
to
a
woman
endorse
with
such
substantial
virtue
.
<EOS>
and
she
be
handsome
too
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
as
he
regard
her
mature
charm
,
sometimes
feel
that
he
should
have
be
smite
even
without
the
forty
thousand
pound
.
"
<EOS>
by
George
!
<EOS>
there
be
flesh
and
blood
,
"
he
have
once
say
to
his
friend
Bellfield
before
he
have
begin
to
suspect
that
man
's
treachery
.
<EOS>
His
admiration
must
then
have
be
sincere
,
for
at
that
time
the
forty
thousand
pound
be
not
an
ascertained
fact
.
<EOS>
look
at
the
matter
in
all
its
bearing
Mr.
Cheesacre
think
that
he
could
not
do
better
.
<EOS>
His
wooing
should
be
fair
,
honest
,
and
above
board
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
thriving
man
,
and
what
may
not
they
two
do
in
Norfolk
if
they
put
their
wealth
together
?
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
you
should
join
them
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
;
"
they
will
not
half
enjoy
themselves
without
you
.
<EOS>
Kate
will
think
that
you
mean
to
neglect
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
dance
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,

you

better
able

do
it

<EOS>
I
do
not

I

,
mind
you

some
of

be
bad
off

Mr.

as

firm
standing
in

become
impetuous
in
the
energy

the
moment

bring
down

powerfully
on

slight
table

them

the
whole
fabric
rattle

the

resound

the
noise
he
have
make
seem
to
assist
him
.
<EOS>

It

all
my

Mrs.

half

then
he
stretch
out

there
be
not

Mrs.

<EOS>
just
at
this
moment
Maria

mother
step
in
under

It
be
most
inopportune
.
<EOS>
Mr.

feel
that
he
be
progress
well
,

be
conscious
that
he
have
get
safely
over
those
fence
in
the
race

his
bashfulness
would
naturally
make
difficult
to
him

He
know
that
he
have
do
this
under
the
influence
of
the
champagne

be
aware
that
it
may
not
be
easy
to
procure
again
a
combination
of
circumstance
that
would
be
so
beneficial
to
him

but
now
he
be
interrupt
just
as
he
be
expect
success

<EOS>
He
be
interrupted
,
and
feel
himself
to
be
look
like
a
guilty
creature
under
the
eye
of
the
strange
lady
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
a
word
to
say
;
but
draw
himself
suddenly
a
foot
and
half
away
from
the
widow
's
side
,
sit
there
confess
his
guilt
in
his
face

<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
feel
no
guilt

afraid

<EOS>
the
attitude
be
justify

the
tune

there

no
reason

a

on

should
have
any
special
termination
in

it
must
have
in

under

the
erratic
step

the
distant
dancer

Mr.

Mr.
Cheesacre
,
good
night

<EOS>
indeed
you
shall

not

<EOS>
"
there
be
that
in
her
voice
which
induce
Mr.
Cheesacre
to
obey
her

which
make
Captain
Bellfield
aware
that
he
would

injure
his

well
,
Kate
,
what
do
you
think
of
the
day
?
<EOS>
"
the
aunt
say
when
she
be
alone
with
her
niece

<EOS>
"
I
never
think
much
about
such
day
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
very
well
,
but
I
fear
I
have
not
the
temperament
fit
for
enjoy
the
fun
.
<EOS>
I
envy
Ophelia
Walker
because
she
make
herself
thoroughly
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
like
to
see
girl
enjoy
themselves
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
I
do
,
indeed
;
 
and
young
man
too
.
<EOS>
It
seem
so
natural
;
why
should
not
young
people
flirt
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
or
old
people
either
for
the
matter
of
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
or
old
people
either
,
 
if
they
do
not
do
any
harm
to
anybody
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
what
it
be
,
Kate
;
people
have
become
so
very
virtuous
,
that
they
be
drive
into
all
manner
of
abominable
resource
for
amusement
and
occupation
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
son
and
daughter
<EOS>
I
should
think
a
little
flirt
the
very
good
thing
for
them
as
a
safety
valve
.
<EOS>
when
people
get
to
be
old
,
there
be
a
difficulty
.
<EOS>
They
want
to
flirt
with
the
young
people
and
the
young
people
do
not
want
them
.
<EOS>
if
the
old
people
would
be
content
to
flirt
together
,
I
do
not
see
why
they
should
ever
give
it
up
;
 
till
they
be
oblige
to
give
up
every
thing
,
and
go
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
that
be
Mrs.
Greenow
's
doctrine
on
the
subject
of
flirtation
.
   
<EOS>
Nethercoats
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
leave
Mrs.
Greenow
with
her
niece
and
two
sister
at
Yarmouth
,
and
return
by
stage
to
London
,
will
call
upon
Mr.
Grey
at
his
place
in
Cambridgeshire
as
we
pass
by
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
be
concede
by
all
the
other
county
,
that
Cambridgeshire
possess
few
rural
beauty
than
any
other
county
in
England
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
flat
;
it
be
not
well
timbere
;
the
river
be
merely
dike
;
and
in
a
very
large
portion
of
the
county
the
farm
and
field
be
divide
simply
by
ditch
 
not
by
hedgerow
.
<EOS>
such
arrangement
be
,
no
doubt
,
well
adapt
for
agricultural
purpose
,
but
be
not
conducive
to
rural
beauty
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
's
residence
be
situate
in
a
part
of
Cambridgeshire
in
which
the
above
-
name
characteristic
be
very
much
mark
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
Isle
of
Ely
,
some
few
mile
distant
from
the
cathedral
town
,
on
the
side
of
a
long
straight
road
,
which
run
through
the
field
for
mile
without
even
a
bush
to
cheer
it
.
<EOS>
the
name
of
his
place
be
Nethercoats
,
and
here
he
live
generally
throughout
the
year
,
and
here
he
intend
to
live
throughout
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
His
father
have
hold
a
prebendal
stall
at
Ely
in
time
when
prebendal
stall
be
worth
more
than
they
be
at
present
,
and
have
also
be
possess
of
a
living
in
the
neighbourhood
,
have
amass
a
considerable
sum
of
money
.
<EOS>
with
this
he
have
during
his
life
purchase
the
property
of
Nethercoats
,
and
have
build
on
it
the
house
in
which
his
son
now
live
.
<EOS>
He
have
marry
late
in
life
,
and
have
lose
his
wife
soon
after
the
birth
of
an
only
child
.
<EOS>
the
house
have
be
build
in
his
own
parish
,
and
his
wife
have
live
there
for
a
few
month
and
have
die
there
.
<EOS>
but
after
that
event
the
old
clergyman
have
go
back
to
his
residence
in
the
close
at
Ely
,
and
there
John
Grey
have
have
the
home
of
his
youth
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
bring
up
under
his
father
's
eye
,
have
be
send
to
no
public
school
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
go
to
Cambridge
,
have
take
college
honour
,
and
have
then
,
his
father
die
exactly
at
this
time
,
decline
to
accept
a
fellowship
.
<EOS>
His
father
have
leave
to
him
an
income
of
some
fifteen
hundred
a
year
,
and
with
this
he
sit
himself
down
,
near
to
his
college
friend
,
near
also
to
the
old
cathedral
which
he
love
,
in
the
house
which
his
father
have
build
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
Nethercoats
possess
no
beauty
of
scenery
,
though
the
country
around
it
be
in
truth
as
uninteresting
as
any
country
could
be
,
it
have
many
delight
of
its
own
.
<EOS>
the
house
itself
be
as
excellent
a
residence
for
a
country
gentleman
of
small
mean
as
taste
and
skill
together
could
construct
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
pretty
room
be
ever
see
than
the
drawing
-
room
,
the
library
,
and
the
dining
-
room
at
Nethercoats
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
on
the
ground
-
floor
,
and
all
open
out
on
to
the
garden
and
lawn
.
<EOS>
the
library
,
which
be
the
large
of
the
three
,
be
a
handsome
chamber
,
and
so
fill
as
to
make
it
well
known
in
the
University
as
one
of
the
good
private
collection
in
that
part
of
England
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
the
garden
of
Nethercoats
constitute
its
great
glory
.
<EOS>
They
be
spacious
and
excellently
keep
up
,
and
have
be
originally
lay
out
with
that
knowledge
of
gardening
without
which
no
garden
,
merely
as
a
garden
,
can
be
effective
.
<EOS>
and
such
,
of
necessity
,
be
the
garden
of
Nethercoats
.
<EOS>
fine
single
forest
tree
there
be
none
there
,
nor
be
it
possible
that
there
should
have
be
any
such
.
<EOS>
nor
could
there
be
a
clear
ripple
stream
with
steep
green
bank
,
and
broken
rock
lie
about
its
bed
.
<EOS>
such
beauty
be
beauty
of
landscape
,
and
do
not
of
their
nature
belong
to
a
garden
.
<EOS>
but
the
shrub
of
Nethercoats
be
of
the
rare
kind
,
and
have
be
long
enough
in
their
present
place
to
have
reach
the
period
of
their
beauty
.
<EOS>
nothing
have
be
spare
that
a
garden
could
want
.
<EOS>
the
fruit
-
tree
be
perfect
in
their
kind
,
and
the
glass
-
house
be
so
good
and
so
extensive
that
John
Grey
in
his
prudence
<EOS>
be
some
time
tempt
to
think
that
he
have
too
much
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
understand
that
there
be
no
ground
,
accord
to
the
meaning
usually
give
to
that
word
,
belong
to
the
house
at
Nethercoats
.
<EOS>
between
the
garden
and
the
public
road
there
be
a
paddock
belong
to
the
house
,
along
the
side
of
which
,
but
divide
from
it
by
a
hedge
and
shrubbery
,
run
the
private
carriageway
up
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
this
sweep
through
the
small
front
flower
-
garden
,
divide
it
equally
;
but
the
lawn
and
indeed
the
whole
of
that
which
make
the
beauty
of
the
place
lie
on
the
back
of
the
house
,
on
which
side
open
the
window
from
the
three
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
down
on
the
public
road
there
stand
a
lodge
at
which
live
one
of
the
gardener
.
<EOS>
there
be
another
field
of
some
six
or
seven
acre
,
to
which
there
be
a
gate
from
the
corner
of
the
front
paddock
,
and
which
go
round
two
side
of
the
garden
.
<EOS>
this
be
Nethercoats
,
and
the
whole
estate
cover
about
twelve
acre
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
place
for
much
bachelor
enjoyment
of
that
sort
generally
popular
with
bachelor
;
nevertheless
Mr.
Grey
have
be
constant
in
his
residence
there
for
the
seven
year
which
have
now
elapse
since
he
have
leave
his
college
.
<EOS>
His
easy
access
to
Cambridge
have
probably
do
much
to
mitigate
what
may
otherwise
have
be
the
too
great
tedium
of
his
life
;
and
he
have
,
prompt
thereto
by
early
association
,
find
most
of
his
society
in
the
close
of
Ely
Cathedral
.
<EOS>
but
,
with
all
the
delight
he
could
derive
from
these
two
source
,
there
have
still
be
many
solitary
hour
in
his
life
,
and
he
have
gradually
learn
to
feel
that
he
of
all
man
want
a
companion
in
his
home
.
  
<EOS>
His
visit
to
London
have
generally
be
short
and
far
between
,
occasion
probably
by
some
need
in
the
library
,
or
by
the
necessity
of
some
slight
literary
transaction
with
the
editor
or
publisher
of
a
periodical
.
<EOS>
in
one
of
these
visit
he
have
meet
Alice
Vavasor
,
and
have
remain
in
Town
,
 
I
will
not
say
till
Alice
have
promise
to
share
his
home
in
Cambridgeshire
,
but
so
long
that
he
have
resolve
before
he
go
that
he
would
ask
her
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
have
ask
her
,
and
we
know
that
he
have
be
successful
.
<EOS>
He
have
obtain
her
promise
,
and
from
that
moment
all
his
life
have
be
change
for
him
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
at
Nethercoats
his
little
smoking
-
room
,
his
book
,
and
his
plant
have
be
everything
to
him
.
<EOS>
now
he
begin
to
surround
himself
with
an
infinity
of
feminine
belonging
,
and
to
promise
himself
an
infinity
of
feminine
blessing
,
wonder
much
that
he
should
have
be
content
to
pass
so
long
a
portion
of
his
life
in
the
dull
seclusion
which
he
have
endure
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
by
nature
an
impatient
man
;
but
now
he
become
impatient
,
long
for
the
fruition
of
his
new
idea
of
happiness
,
 
longing
to
have
that
as
his
own
which
he
certainly
love
beyond
all
else
in
the
world
,
and
which
,
perhaps
,
be
all
he
have
ever
love
with
the
perfect
love
of
equality
.
<EOS>
but
though
impatient
,
and
fully
aware
of
his
own
impatience
,
he
acknowledge
to
himself
that
Alice
could
not
be
expect
to
share
it
.
<EOS>
He
could
plan
nothing
now
,
 
could
have
no
pleasure
in
life
that
she
be
not
expect
to
share
.
<EOS>
but
as
yet
it
could
not
be
so
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
her
house
in
London
,
her
town
society
,
and
her
father
.
<EOS>
and
,
inasmuch
as
the
change
for
her
would
be
much
great
than
it
would
be
for
him
<EOS>
,
it
be
natural
that
she
should
require
some
small
delay
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
press
her
.
<EOS>
at
least
he
have
not
press
her
with
that
eager
pressure
which
a
girl
must
resist
with
something
of
the
opposition
of
a
contest
,
if
she
resist
it
at
all
.
<EOS>
but
in
truth
his
impatience
be
now
wax
strong
,
and
during
the
absence
in
Switzerland
of
which
we
have
speak
,
he
resolve
that
a
marriage
very
late
in
the
autumn
,
 
that
a
marriage
even
in
winter
,
would
be
well
than
a
marriage
postpone
till
the
following
year
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
yet
late
in
August
when
the
party
return
from
their
tour
.
<EOS>
Would
not
a
further
delay
of
two
month
suffice
for
his
bride
?
  
<EOS>
Alice
have
write
to
him
occasionally
from
Switzerland
,
and
her
first
two
letter
have
be
very
charming
.
<EOS>
They
have
refer
almost
exclusively
to
the
tour
,
and
have
be
make
pleasant
with
some
slightly
coloured
account
of
George
Vavasor
's
idleness
,
and
of
Kate
's
obedience
to
her
brother
's
behest
.
<EOS>
Alice
have
never
write
much
of
love
in
her
love
-
letter
,
and
Grey
be
well
enough
content
with
her
style
,
though
it
be
not
impassione
.
<EOS>
as
for
doubt
her
love
,
it
be
not
in
the
heart
of
the
man
to
do
so
after
it
have
be
once
assure
to
him
by
her
word
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
so
slightly
respect
himself
or
her
as
to
leave
room
for
such
a
doubt
in
his
bosom
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
who
could
never
have
suggest
to
himself
that
a
woman
love
him
till
the
fact
be
there
before
him
;
but
who
have
ascertain
,
as
he
may
think
,
the
fact
,
could
never
suggest
to
himself
that
her
love
would
fail
him
.
<EOS>
Her
first
two
letter
from
Switzerland
have
be
very
pleasant
;
but
after
that
there
have
seem
to
have
creep
over
her
a
melancholy
which
she
unconsciously
transfer
to
her
word
,
and
which
he
could
not
but
taste
in
them
,
 
at
first
unconsciously
,
also
,
but
soon
with
so
plain
a
flavour
that
he
recognise
it
,
and
make
it
a
matter
of
mental
inquiry
.
<EOS>
during
the
three
or
four
last
day
of
the
journey
,
while
they
be
at
Basle
and
on
their
way
home
,
she
have
not
write
.
<EOS>
but
she
do
write
on
the
day
after
her
arrival
,
have
then
receive
from
Mr.
Grey
a
letter
,
in
which
he
tell
her
how
very
much
she
would
add
to
his
happiness
if
she
would
now
agree
that
their
marriage
should
not
be
postpone
beyond
the
end
of
October
.
<EOS>
this
letter
she
find
in
her
room
on
her
return
,
and
this
she
answer
at
once
.
<EOS>
and
she
answer
it
in
such
word
that
Mr.
Grey
resolve
that
he
would
at
once
go
to
her
in
London
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
her
letter
at
length
,
as
I
shall
then
be
best
able
to
proceed
with
my
story
quickly
.

DEAREST
JOHN
,
    
<EOS>
We
reach
home
yesterday
tired
enough
,
as
we
come
through
from
Paris
without
stop
.
<EOS>
I
may
indeed
say
that
we
come
through
from
Strasbourg
,
as
we
only
sleep
in
Paris
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
Strasbourg
.
<EOS>
a
steeple
,
after
all
,
be
not
everything
,
and
put
the
steeple
aside
,
I
do
not
think
the
style
be
good
.
<EOS>
but
the
hotel
be
uncomfortable
,
which
go
for
so
much
;
 
and
then
we
be
saturate
with
beauty
of
a
well
kind
.
  
<EOS>
I
get
your
letter
<EOS>
directly
I
come
in
last
night
,
and
I
suppose
I
have
well
dash
at
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
would
so
willingly
delay
do
so
,
say
nice
little
thing
the
while
,
do
I
not
know
that
this
would
be
mere
cowardice
.
<EOS>
whatever
happen
I
will
not
be
a
coward
,
and
therefore
I
will
tell
you
at
once
that
I
can
not
let
you
hope
that
we
should
be
marry
this
year
.
<EOS>
of
course
you
will
ask
me
why
,
as
you
have
a
right
to
do
,
and
of
course
I
be
bind
to
answer
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
I
can
give
any
answer
with
which
you
will
not
have
a
right
to
complain
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
so
,
I
can
only
ask
your
pardon
for
the
injury
I
be
do
you
.
  
<EOS>
marriage
be
a
great
change
in
life
,
 
much
great
to
me
than
to
you
,
who
will
remain
in
your
old
house
,
will
keep
your
old
pursuit
,
will
still
be
your
own
master
,
and
will
change
in
nothing
,
 
except
in
this
,
that
you
will
have
a
companion
who
probably
may
not
be
all
that
you
expect
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
change
everything
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
to
me
as
though
I
be
pass
through
a
grave
to
a
new
world
.
<EOS>
I
shall
see
nothing
that
I
have
be
accustom
to
see
,
and
must
abandon
all
the
way
of
life
that
I
have
hitherto
adopt
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
should
have
think
of
this
before
I
accept
you
;
and
I
do
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
make
up
my
mind
that
,
as
I
truly
love
you
,
I
would
risk
the
change
;
 
that
I
would
risk
it
for
your
sake
and
for
mine
,
hope
that
I
may
add
something
to
your
happiness
,
and
that
I
may
secure
my
own
.
<EOS>
Dear
John
,
do
not
suppose
that
I
despair
that
it
may
be
so
;
but
,
indeed
,
you
must
not
hurry
me
.
<EOS>
I
must
tune
myself
to
the
change
that
I
have
to
make
.
<EOS>
what
if
I
should
wake
some
morning
after
six
month
live
with
you
,
and
tell
you
that
the
quiet
of
your
home
be
make
me
mad
?
  
<EOS>
You
must
not
ask
me
again
till
the
winter
shall
have
pass
away
.
<EOS>
if
in
the
meantime
I
shall
find
that
I
have
be
wrong
,
I
will
humbly
confess
that
I
have
wrong
you
,
and
ask
you
to
forgive
me
.
<EOS>
and
I
will
freely
admit
this
.
<EOS>
if
the
delay
which
I
now
purpose
be
so
contrary
to
your
own
plan
as
to
make
your
marriage
,
under
such
circumstance
,
not
that
which
you
have
expect
,
I
know
that
you
be
free
to
tell
me
so
,
and
to
say
that
our
engagement
shall
be
over
.
<EOS>
I
be
well
aware
that
I
can
have
no
right
to
bind
you
to
a
marriage
at
one
period
which
you
have
only
contemplate
as
to
take
place
at
another
period
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
may
promise
that
I
will
obey
any
wish
you
may
express
in
anything
,
 
except
in
that
one
thing
which
you
urge
in
your
last
letter
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
be
go
down
to
Yarmouth
with
Mrs.
Greenow
,
and
I
shall
see
no
more
of
her
probably
till
next
year
,
as
she
will
be
due
in
Westmoreland
after
that
.
<EOS>
George
leave
me
at
the
door
when
he
bring
me
home
,
and
declare
that
he
intend
to
vanish
out
of
London
.
<EOS>
whether
in
town
or
out
,
he
be
never
to
be
see
at
this
period
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
Papa
offer
to
go
to
ramsgate
for
a
fortnight
,
but
he
look
so
wretched
when
he
make
the
offer
,
that
I
shall
not
have
the
heart
to
hold
him
to
it
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
very
much
want
me
to
go
to
Cheltenham
.
<EOS>
I
very
much
want
not
to
go
,
simply
because
I
can
never
agree
with
her
about
anything
;
but
it
will
probably
end
in
my
go
there
for
a
week
or
two
.
<EOS>
over
and
beyond
that
,
I
have
no
prospect
before
Christmas
which
be
not
purely
domestic
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
project
that
we
shall
all
eat
our
Christmas
dinner
at
Vavasor
Hall
,
 
of
course
not
include
George
,
 
but
<EOS>
this
project
be
quite
in
the
cloud
,
and
,
as
far
as
I
be
concerned
,
will
remain
there
.
  
<EOS>
Dear
John
,
let
me
hear
that
this
letter
do
not
make
you
unhappy
.
  
<EOS>
most
affectionately
yours
,
  
ALICE
VAVASOR
.
  
<EOS>
at
Nethercoats
,
the
post
be
bring
in
at
breakfast
-
time
,
and
Mr.
Grey
be
sit
with
his
tea
and
egg
before
him
,
when
he
read
Alice
's
letter
.
<EOS>
He
read
it
twice
before
he
begin
to
think
what
he
would
do
in
regard
to
it
,
and
then
refer
to
one
or
two
other
which
he
have
receive
from
Switzerland
,
 
read
them
also
very
carefully
.
<EOS>
after
that
,
he
take
up
the
slouch
hat
which
he
have
be
wear
in
the
garden
before
he
be
call
to
his
breakfast
,
and
,
with
the
letter
in
his
hand
,
saunter
down
among
the
shrub
and
lawn
.
  
<EOS>
He
know
,
he
think
he
know
,
that
there
be
more
in
Alice
's
mind
than
a
mere
wish
for
delay
.
<EOS>
there
be
more
in
it
than
that
hesitation
to
take
at
once
a
step
which
she
really
desire
to
take
,
if
not
now
,
then
after
some
short
interval
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
she
be
unhappy
,
and
unhappy
because
she
distrust
the
result
of
her
marriage
;
but
it
never
for
a
moment
occur
to
him
that
,
therefore
,
the
engagement
between
them
should
be
break
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
he
love
her
too
well
to
allow
of
his
admit
such
an
idea
without
terrible
sorrow
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
constant
,
firm
man
,
somewhat
reserved
,
and
unwilling
to
make
new
acquaintance
,
and
,
therefore
,
specially
unwilling
to
break
away
from
those
which
he
have
make
.
<EOS>
undoubtedly
,
have
he
satisfy
himself
that
Alice
's
happiness
demand
such
a
sacrifice
of
himself
,
he
would
have
make
it
,
and
make
it
without
a
word
of
complaint
.
<EOS>
the
blow
would
not
have
prostrate
him
,
but
the
bruise
would
have
remain
on
his
heart
,
indelible
,
not
to
be
heal
but
by
death
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
submit
,
and
no
man
would
have
see
that
he
have
be
injure
.
<EOS>
but
it
do
not
once
occur
to
him
that
such
a
proceeding
on
his
part
would
be
beneficial
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
without
be
aware
of
it
,
he
reckon
himself
to
be
the
noble
creature
of
the
two
,
and
now
think
of
her
as
of
one
wound
,
and
want
a
cure
.
<EOS>
some
weakness
have
fall
on
her
,
and
strength
must
be
give
to
her
from
another
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
in
the
least
doubt
her
love
,
but
he
know
that
she
have
be
associate
,
for
a
few
week
past
,
with
two
person
whose
daily
conversation
would
be
prone
to
weaken
the
tone
of
her
mind
.
<EOS>
He
no
more
thought
of
give
her
up
than
a
man
think
of
have
his
leg
cut
off
because
he
have
sprain
his
sinew
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
up
to
town
and
see
her
,
and
would
not
even
yet
abandon
all
hope
that
she
may
be
find
sit
at
his
board
when
Christmas
should
come
.
<EOS>
by
that
day
's
post
he
write
a
short
note
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
dearest
Alice
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
have
resolve
to
go
to
London
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
with
you
in
the
evening
at
eight
,
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yours
,
J.
G.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
more
in
the
letter
than
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
"
she
say
,
when
she
receive
it
,
"
I
must
dare
to
tell
him
the
whole
truth
.
"
   
<EOS>
John
Grey
go
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
and
what
be
the
whole
truth
?
<EOS>
Alice
Vavasor
,
when
she
declare
to
herself
that
she
must
tell
her
lover
the
whole
truth
,
be
express
to
herself
her
intention
of
put
an
end
to
her
engagement
with
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
She
be
acknowledge
that
that
which
have
to
be
tell
be
not
compatible
with
the
love
and
perfect
faith
which
she
owe
to
the
man
who
be
her
affiance
husband
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
why
should
it
be
so
?
<EOS>
She
do
not
intend
to
tell
him
that
she
have
be
false
in
her
love
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
her
heart
have
again
veer
itself
round
and
give
itself
to
that
wild
cousin
of
her
.
<EOS>
though
she
may
feel
herself
constrain
to
part
from
John
Grey
,
George
Vavasor
could
never
be
her
husband
.
<EOS>
of
that
she
assure
herself
fifty
time
during
the
two
day
'
grace
which
have
be
allow
her
.
<EOS>
nay
,
she
go
farther
than
that
with
herself
,
and
pronounce
a
verdict
against
any
marriage
as
possible
to
her
if
she
now
decide
against
this
marriage
which
have
for
some
month
past
be
regard
as
fix
by
herself
and
all
her
friend
.
  
<EOS>
People
often
say
that
marriage
be
an
important
thing
,
and
should
be
much
thought
of
in
advance
,
and
marry
people
be
caution
that
there
be
many
who
marry
in
haste
and
repent
at
leisure
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
,
however
,
that
marriage
may
not
be
ponder
over
too
much
;
nor
do
I
feel
certain
that
the
leisurely
repentance
do
not
as
often
follow
the
leisurely
marriage
as
it
do
the
rapid
one
.
<EOS>
that
some
repent
no
one
can
doubt
;
but
I
be
incline
to
believe
that
most
man
and
woman
take
their
lot
as
they
find
them
,
marry
as
the
bird
do
by
force
of
nature
,
and
go
on
with
their
mate
with
a
general
,
though
not
perhaps
an
undisturbed
satisfaction
,
feel
inwardly
assure
that
Providence
,
if
it
have
not
do
the
very
good
for
them
,
have
do
for
them
as
well
as
they
could
do
for
themselves
with
all
the
thought
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
a
woman
can
assure
to
herself
,
by
her
own
prudence
and
taste
,
a
good
husband
any
more
than
she
can
add
two
cubit
to
her
stature
;
but
husband
have
be
make
to
be
decently
good
,
 
and
wife
too
,
for
the
most
part
,
in
our
country
,
 
so
that
the
thing
do
not
require
quite
so
much
thinking
as
some
people
say
.
  
<EOS>
that
Alice
Vavasor
have
think
too
much
about
it
,
I
feel
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
She
have
go
on
thinking
of
it
till
she
have
fill
herself
with
a
cloud
of
doubt
which
even
the
sunshine
of
love
be
unable
to
drive
from
her
heaven
.
<EOS>
that
a
girl
should
really
love
the
man
she
intend
to
marry
,
 
that
,
at
any
rate
,
may
be
admit
.
<EOS>
but
love
generally
come
easily
enough
.
<EOS>
with
all
her
doubt
Alice
never
doubt
her
love
for
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
nor
do
she
doubt
his
character
,
nor
his
temper
,
nor
his
mean
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
go
on
thinking
of
the
matter
till
her
mind
have
become
fill
with
some
undefined
idea
of
the
importance
to
her
of
her
own
life
.
<EOS>
what
should
a
woman
do
with
her
life
?
<EOS>
there
have
arise
round
her
a
flock
of
learned
lady
ask
that
question
,
to
whom
it
seem
that
the
proper
answer
have
never
yet
occur
.
<EOS>
fall
in
love
,
marry
the
man
,
have
two
child
,
and
live
happy
ever
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
maintain
that
answer
have
as
much
wisdom
in
it
as
any
other
that
can
be
give
;
 
or
perhaps
more
.
<EOS>
the
advice
contain
in
it
can
not
,
perhaps
,
always
be
follow
to
the
letter
;
but
neither
can
the
advice
of
the
other
kind
,
which
be
give
by
the
flock
of
learned
lady
who
ask
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
a
woman
's
life
be
important
to
her
,
 
as
be
that
of
a
man
to
him
,
 
not
chiefly
in
regard
to
that
which
she
shall
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
the
chief
thing
for
her
to
look
to
be
the
manner
in
which
that
something
shall
be
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
moment
to
a
young
man
when
enter
life
to
decide
whether
he
shall
make
hat
or
shoe
;
but
not
of
half
the
moment
that
will
be
that
other
decision
,
whether
he
shall
make
good
shoe
or
bad
.
<EOS>
and
so
with
a
woman
;
 
if
she
shall
have
recognise
the
necessity
of
truth
and
honesty
for
the
purpose
of
her
life
,
I
do
not
know
that
she
nee
ask
herself
many
question
as
to
what
she
will
do
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
Vavasor
be
ever
ask
herself
that
question
,
and
have
by
degree
fill
herself
with
a
vague
idea
that
there
be
a
something
to
be
do
;
a
something
over
and
beyond
,
or
perhaps
altogether
beside
that
marry
and
have
two
child
;
 
if
she
only
know
what
it
be
.
<EOS>
She
have
fill
herself
,
or
have
be
fill
by
her
cousin
,
with
an
undefined
ambition
that
make
her
restless
without
give
her
any
real
food
for
her
mind
.
<EOS>
when
she
tell
herself
that
she
would
have
no
scope
for
action
in
that
life
in
Cambridgeshire
which
Mr.
Grey
be
prepare
for
her
,
she
do
not
herself
know
what
she
mean
by
action
.
<EOS>
have
any
one
accuse
her
of
be
afraid
to
separate
herself
from
London
society
,
she
would
have
declare
that
she
go
very
little
into
society
and
dislike
that
little
.
<EOS>
have
it
be
whisper
to
her
that
she
love
the
neighbourhood
of
the
shop
,
she
would
have
scorn
the
whisperer
.
<EOS>
have
it
be
suggest
that
the
continue
rattle
of
the
big
city
be
necessary
to
her
happiness
,
she
would
have
declare
that
she
and
her
father
have
pick
out
for
their
residence
the
quiet
street
in
London
because
she
could
not
bear
noise
;
 
and
yet
she
tell
herself
that
she
fear
to
be
take
into
the
desolate
calmness
of
Cambridgeshire
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
do
contrive
to
find
any
answer
to
that
question
as
to
what
she
should
do
with
her
life
,
 
or
rather
what
she
would
wish
to
do
with
it
if
she
be
a
free
agent
,
it
be
generally
of
a
political
nature
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
so
far
advanced
as
to
think
that
woman
should
be
lawyer
and
doctor
,
or
to
wish
that
she
may
have
the
privilege
of
the
franchise
for
herself
;
but
she
have
undoubtedly
a
hankering
after
some
second
-
hand
political
manoeuvering
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
like
,
I
think
,
to
have
be
the
wife
of
the
leader
of
a
radical
opposition
,
in
the
time
when
such
man
be
put
into
prison
,
and
to
have
keep
up
for
him
his
seditious
correspondence
while
he
lie
in
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
carry
the
answer
to
him
inside
her
stay
,
 
and
have
make
long
journey
down
into
northern
part
without
any
money
,
if
the
cause
require
it
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
like
to
have
around
her
ardent
spirit
,
male
or
female
,
who
would
have
talk
of
"
the
cause
,
"
and
have
keep
alive
in
her
some
flame
of
political
fire
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
she
have
no
cause
.
<EOS>
Her
father
's
political
view
be
very
mild
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
's
be
deadly
conservative
.
<EOS>
Kate
Vavasor
be
an
aspire
Radical
just
now
,
because
her
brother
be
in
the
same
line
;
but
during
the
year
of
the
love
-
passage
between
George
and
Alice
,
George
Vavasor
's
politic
have
be
as
conservative
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
become
a
Radical
till
he
have
quarrel
with
his
grandfather
.
<EOS>
now
,
indeed
,
he
be
possess
of
very
advanced
view
,
 
view
with
which
Alice
feel
that
she
could
sympathize
.
<EOS>
but
what
would
be
the
use
of
sympathize
down
in
Cambridgeshire
?
<EOS>
John
Grey
have
,
so
to
speak
,
no
politic
.
<EOS>
He
have
decide
view
as
to
the
treatment
which
the
roman
Senate
receive
from
Augustus
,
and
have
even
discuss
with
Alice
the
conduct
of
the
girondist
at
the
time
of
Robespierre
's
triumph
;
but
for
Manchester
and
its
care
he
have
no
apparent
solicitude
,
and
have
declare
to
Alice
that
he
would
not
accept
a
seat
in
the
British
House
of
Commons
if
it
be
offer
to
him
free
of
expense
.
<EOS>
what
political
enthusiasm
could
she
indulge
with
such
a
companion
down
in
Cambridgeshire
?
  
<EOS>
She
think
too
much
of
all
this
,
 
and
be
,
if
I
may
say
,
over
-
prudent
in
calculate
the
chance
of
her
happiness
and
of
his
.
<EOS>
for
,
to
give
her
credit
for
what
be
her
due
,
she
be
quite
as
anxious
on
the
latter
head
as
on
the
former
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
for
the
roman
Senate
,
"
she
would
say
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
much
for
the
girondist
.
<EOS>
how
be
I
to
talk
to
him
day
after
day
,
night
after
night
,
when
we
shall
be
alone
together
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
no
doubt
her
tour
in
Switzerland
with
her
cousin
have
have
some
effect
in
make
such
thought
strong
now
than
they
have
ever
be
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
again
learn
to
love
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
She
be
as
firmly
sure
as
ever
that
she
could
never
love
him
more
.
<EOS>
He
have
insult
her
love
;
and
though
she
have
forgive
him
and
again
enrol
him
among
her
dear
friend
,
she
could
never
again
feel
for
him
that
passion
which
a
woman
mean
when
she
acknowledge
that
she
be
in
love
.
<EOS>
that
,
as
regard
her
and
George
Vavasor
,
be
over
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
there
have
be
a
something
of
romance
during
those
day
in
Switzerland
which
she
fear
she
would
regret
when
she
find
herself
settle
at
Nethercoats
.
<EOS>
She
envy
Kate
.
<EOS>
Kate
could
,
as
his
sister
,
attach
herself
on
to
George
's
political
career
,
and
obtain
from
it
all
that
excitement
of
life
which
Alice
desire
for
herself
.
<EOS>
Alice
could
not
love
her
cousin
and
marry
him
;
but
she
feel
that
if
she
could
do
so
without
impropriety
she
would
like
to
stick
close
to
him
like
another
sister
,
to
spend
her
money
in
aid
his
career
in
Parliament
as
Kate
would
do
,
and
trust
herself
and
her
career
into
the
boat
which
he
be
to
command
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
love
her
cousin
;
but
she
still
believe
in
him
,
 
with
a
faith
which
he
certainly
do
not
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
two
day
pass
over
her
,
her
mind
grow
more
and
more
fixed
as
to
its
purpose
.
<EOS>
She
would
tell
Mr.
Grey
that
she
be
not
fit
to
be
his
wife
 
<EOS>
and
she
would
beg
him
to
pardon
her
and
to
leave
her
.
<EOS>
It
never
occur
to
her
that
perhaps
he
may
refuse
to
let
her
go
.
<EOS>
She
feel
quite
sure
that
she
would
be
free
as
soon
as
she
have
speak
the
word
which
she
intend
to
speak
.
<EOS>
if
she
could
speak
it
with
decision
she
would
be
free
,
and
to
attain
that
decision
she
would
school
herself
with
her
utmost
strength
.
<EOS>
at
one
moment
she
think
of
tell
all
to
her
father
and
of
beg
him
to
break
the
matter
to
Mr.
Grey
;
but
she
know
that
her
father
would
not
understand
her
,
and
that
he
would
be
very
hostile
to
her
,
 
say
hard
,
uncomfortable
word
,
which
would
probably
be
spare
if
the
thing
be
do
before
he
be
inform
.
<EOS>
nor
would
she
write
to
Kate
,
whose
letter
to
her
at
this
time
be
full
of
wit
at
the
expense
of
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
She
would
tell
Kate
as
soon
as
the
thing
be
do
,
but
not
before
.
<EOS>
that
Kate
would
sympathize
with
her
,
she
be
quite
certain
.
  
<EOS>
so
the
two
day
pass
by
and
the
time
come
at
which
John
Grey
be
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
as
the
minute
hand
on
the
drawing
-
room
clock
come
round
to
the
full
hour
,
she
feel
that
her
heart
be
beat
with
a
violence
which
she
could
not
repress
.
<EOS>
the
thing
seem
to
her
to
assume
big
dimension
than
it
have
hitherto
do
.
<EOS>
She
begin
to
be
aware
that
she
be
about
to
be
guilty
of
a
great
iniquity
,
when
it
be
too
late
for
her
to
change
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
resolve
that
she
would
,
on
the
moment
,
change
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
believe
that
she
could
never
pardon
herself
such
weakness
.
<EOS>
but
yet
she
feel
herself
to
be
aware
that
her
purpose
be
wicked
.
<EOS>
when
the
knock
at
the
door
be
at
last
hear
she
tremble
and
fear
that
she
would
almost
be
unable
to
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
may
it
be
possible
that
there
should
yet
be
a
reprieve
for
her
?
<EOS>
no
;
it
be
his
step
on
the
stair
,
and
there
he
be
in
the
room
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
he
say
,
come
to
her
.
<EOS>
His
smile
be
sweet
and
loving
as
it
ever
be
,
and
his
voice
have
its
usual
manly
,
genial
,
love
tone
.
<EOS>
as
he
walk
across
the
room
Alice
feel
that
he
be
a
man
of
whom
a
wife
may
be
very
proud
.
<EOS>
He
be
tall
and
very
handsome
,
with
brown
hair
,
with
bright
blue
eye
,
and
a
mouth
like
a
god
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
beauty
of
his
mouth
,
 
beauty
which
comprise
firmness
within
itself
,
that
make
Alice
afraid
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
still
dress
in
his
morning
clothe
;
but
he
be
a
man
who
always
seem
to
be
well
dressed
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
he
say
,
advance
across
the
room
,
and
before
she
know
how
to
stop
herself
or
him
,
he
have
take
her
in
his
arm
and
kiss
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
immediately
begin
about
the
letter
,
but
place
her
upon
the
sofa
,
seat
himself
by
her
side
,
and
look
into
her
face
with
love
eye
,
 
not
as
though
to
scrutinize
what
may
be
amiss
there
,
but
as
though
determine
to
enjoy
to
the
full
his
privilege
as
a
lover
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
reproach
at
any
rate
in
his
countenance
;
 
none
as
yet
;
nor
do
it
seem
that
he
think
that
he
have
any
cause
for
fear
.
<EOS>
They
sit
in
this
way
for
a
moment
or
two
in
silence
,
and
during
those
moment
Alice
be
summon
up
her
courage
to
speak
.
<EOS>
the
palpitation
at
her
heart
be
already
go
,
and
she
be
determine
that
she
would
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
though
I
be
very
glad
to
see
you
,
"
she
say
,
at
last
,
"
I
be
sorry
that
my
letter
should
have
give
you
the
trouble
of
this
journey
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
trouble
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
nay
,
you
ought
to
know
that
it
be
no
trouble
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
enough
to
do
down
at
Nethercoats
to
make
the
running
up
to
you
at
any
time
an
unpleasant
excitement
.
<EOS>
so

swiss
journey

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

<EOS>
this
she

in
that
tone
of
voice
which
clearly
imply
that
the
speaker
be
not

of
the
word

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
Kate

now

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"

her
aunt

at
the
seaside
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so

;
 
and

cousin
George
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
know
much
of
George

movement
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
in
Town
,
but
I
have
not
see
him
since
I
come
back

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
ah

<EOS>
that

the
way

in
London
.
<EOS>
unless
circumstance
bring
them
together
,
they
be
in
fact
further
apart
than
if
they
live
fifty
mile
asunder
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
and
he
manage
to
get
through
all
the
trouble
without
lose
your
luggage
for
you
very
often
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
to
say
that
we
do
not
lose
his
,
that
would
be
nearer
the
mark
.
<EOS>
but
,
John
,
you
have
come
up
to
London
in
this
sudden
way
to
speak
to
me
about
my
letter
to
you

"
  
<EOS>
"

so
.
<EOS>

I
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
think
much
,
since
,
of
what
I
then
write
,
very
much
,
 
very
much
,
indeed
;
and
I
have
learn
to
feel
sure
that
we
have
well
 
"
  
"
stop
,
Alice
;
stop
a
moment
,
love
.
<EOS>
do
not
speak
hurriedly
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
you
what
I
learn
from
your
letter
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
;
tell
me
,
if
you
think
it
better
that
you
should
do
so
.
"
  
"
perhaps
it
may
be
well
.
<EOS>
I
learn
,
love
,
that
something
have
be
say
or
do
during
your
journey
,
 
or
perhaps
only
something
think
,
that
have
make
you
melancholy
,
and
fill
your
mind
for
a
while
with
those
unsubstantial
and
indefinable
regret
for
the
past
which
we
be
all
apt
to
feel
at
certain
moment
of
our
life
.
<EOS>
there
be
few
of
us
who
do
not
encounter
,
now
and
again
,
some
of
that
irrational
spirit
of
sadness
which
,
when
over
-
indulge
,
drive
man
to
madness
and
self
-
destruction
.
<EOS>
I
use
to
know
well
what
it
be
before
I
know
you
;
but
since
I
have
have
the
hope
of
have
you
in
my
house
,
I
have
banish
it
utterly
.
<EOS>
in
that
I
think
I
have
be
strong
than
you
.
<EOS>
do
not
speak
under
the
influence
of
that
spirit
till
you
have
think
whether
you
,
too
,
can
not
banish
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
try
,
and
it
will
not
be
banish

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

try
again

<EOS>
It
be
a
damned
spirit
,
and
belong
neither

do
not

to
me
the
word

wrestle
with
it
manfully

can
read
your
mind

tell
me
that
I
may
return
to
Cambridgeshire
,
and
again
plead
my
cause
for
an
early
marriage
from
thence

<EOS>
I
will
not
take
such
speech
from
you
to
mean
more
than

"
  
<EOS>
She
sit
quiet
,
look
at
him
 
look
full
into
his
face
.
<EOS>
She
have
in
nowise
change
her
mind

but
after
such
word
from
him
,
she
do
not
know
how
to
declare
to
him
her
resolution
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
his
manner
that
awe
her
,
 
and
something
also
that
soften
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
tell
me

that
I
may
see
you

Pronounce
a

<EOS>
"
no

I
can
not

she
say
.
<EOS>
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
,
as
she
speak
,
be
different
to
any
tone
that
he
have
hear
before
from
her
mouth

<EOS>
"
be
that
melancholy
fiend
too
strong
for
you

<EOS>
He
smile
as
he
say
this
,
and
as
he
smile
,
he
take
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
attempt
to
withdraw
it
,
but
sit
by
him
in
a
strange
calmness
,
look
straight
before
her
into
the
middle
of
the
room

"
You
have
not
struggle
with
it

wicked
one

I
would

that
is

good

;
and
then
I
would
bid
her
ask
his
pardon
humbly
on
her
knee
.
<EOS>
"
as
she
say
this
,
she
sink
before
him
on
to
the
floor
,
and
look
up
into
his
face
with
an
expression
of
sad
contrition
which
almost
draw
him
from
his
purposed
firmness
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
purpose
to
be
firm
,
 
to
yield
to
her
in
nothing
,
resolve
to
treat
all
that
she
may
say
as
the
hallucination
of
a
sickened
imagination
,
 
as
the
effect
of
absolute
want
of
health
,
for
which
some
change
in
her
mode
of
life
would
be
the
good
cure
.
<EOS>
She
may
bid
him
begone
in
what
language
she
would
.
<EOS>
He
know
well
that
such
be
her
intention
.
<EOS>
but
he
would
not
allow
a
word
come
from
her
in
such
a
way
to
disturb
arrangement
make
for
the
happiness
of
their
joint
life
.
<EOS>
as
a
loving
husband
would
treat
a
wife
,
who
,
in
some
exceptionable
moment
of
a
melancholy
malady
,
should
declare
herself
unable
to
remain
longer
in
her
home
,
so
would
he
treat
her
.
<EOS>
as
for
accept
what
she
may
say
as
his
dismissal
,
he
would
as
soon
think
of
take
the
fruit
-
tree
from
the
southern
wall
because
the
sun
sometimes
shine
from
the
north
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
treat
either
his
interest
or
her
so
lightly
as
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
if
he
grant
no
such
pardon
,
Alice
?
<EOS>
I
will
grant
none
such
.
<EOS>
You

then
he
put
his
hand
upon
her
hair

as
though
he
would
caress
her

<EOS>
He
shake
his
head
and
still
smile
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
the
imperturbed
security
of
his
manner
which
almost
make
her
angry
with
him
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
though
he
assume
so
great
a
superiority
that
he
feel
himself
able
to
treat
any
resolve
of
her
as
the
petulance
of
a
child
.
<EOS>
and
though
he
speak
in
strong
language
of
his
love
,
and
of
his
longing
that
she
should
come
to
him
,
yet
he
be
so
well
able
to
command
his
feeling
,
that
he
show
no
sign
of
grief
at
the
communication
she
have
make
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
doubt
his
love
,
but
she
believe
him
to
be
so
much
the
master
of
his
love
,
 
as
he
be
the
master
of
everything
else
,
that
her
separation
from
him
would
cause
him
no
uncontrollable
grief
.
<EOS>
in
that
she
utterly
fail
to
understand
his
character
.
<EOS>
have
she
know
him
better
,
she
may
have
be
sure
that
such
a
separation
now
would
with
him
have
carry
its
mark
to
the
grave
.
<EOS>
Should
he
submit
to
her
decision
,
he
would
go
home
and
settle
himself
to
his
book
the
next
day
;
but
on
no
follow
day
would
he
be
again
capable
of
walk
forth
among
his
flower
with
an
easy
heart
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
strong
,
constant
man
,
perhaps
over
-
conscious
of
his
own
strength
;
but
then
his
strength
be
great
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
perfect
!
"
<EOS>
Alice
have
say
to
herself
often
.
<EOS>
"
oh
that
he
be
less
perfect
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
stay
with
her
long
after
the
last
word
that
have
be
record
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
"
he
say
,
as
for
a
moment
he
hold
her
hand
at
parting
,
"

well

no

no

I
advise

your

doubtless
you

why

it

shade
too
good

well

I

always

that
myself

tired

no

Nethercoats
early

good
night

<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor

as
he
go
up
to
his
bedroom

feel
sure
that
there
have
be
something
wrong
between
his

lover

I
do

to
himself

be
so
terribly
conceited

<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
how
he
go
on
about
Charles
Kemble
,
and
what
a
fool
he
make
of
himself

"
  
<EOS>
Alice
,
before
she
go
to
bed
,
sit
down
and
write
a
letter
to
her
cousin
Kate
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
George
Vavasor
at
Home
.
 
<EOS>
It
can
not
perhaps
fairly
be
say
that
George
Vavasor
be
an
unhospitable
man
,
see
that
it
be
his
custom
to
entertain
his
friend
occasionally
at
Greenwich
,
Richmond
,
or
such
place
;
and
he
would
now
and
again
have
a
friend
to
dine
with
him
at
his
club
.
<EOS>
but
he
never
give
breakfast
,
dinner
,
or
supper
under
his
own
roof
.
<EOS>
during
a
short
period
of
his
wine
-
sell
career
,
at
which
time
he
have
occupy
handsome
room
over
his
place
of
business
in
New
Burlington
Street
,
he
have
preside
at
certain
feast
give
to
customer
or
expectant
customer
by
the
firm
;
but
he
have
not
find
this
employment
to
his
taste
,
and
have
soon
relinquish
it
to
one
of
the
other
partner
.
<EOS>
since
that
he
have
live
in
lodging
in
Cecil
Street
,
 
down
at
the
bottom
of
that
retire
nook
,
near
to
the
river
and
away
from
the
Strand
.
<EOS>
here
he
have
simply
two
room
on
the
first
floor
,
and
hither
his
friend
come
to
him
very
rarely
.
<EOS>
They
come
very
rarely
on
any
account
.
<EOS>
a
stray
man
may
now
and
then
pass
an
hour
with
him
here
;
but
on
such
occasion
the
chance
be
that
the
visit
have
some
reference
,
near
or
distant
,
to
affair
of
business
.
<EOS>
eating
or
drink
there
be
never
any
to
be
find
here
by
the
most
intimate
of
his
ally
.
<EOS>
His
lodging
be
his
private
retreat
,
and
they
be
so
private
that
<EOS>
but
few
of
his
friend
know
where
he
live
.
  
<EOS>
and
have
it
be
possible
<EOS>
he
would
have
wish
that
no
one
should
have
know
his
whereabouts
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
aware
that
he
have
any
special
reason
for
this
peculiarity
,
or
that
there
be
anything
about
his
mode
of
life
that
require
hiding
;
but
he
be
a
man
who
have
always
live
as
though
secrecy
in
certain
matter
may
at
any
time
become
useful
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
mode
of
dress
himself
when
he
go
out
at
night
that
make
it
almost
impossible
that
any
one
should
recognise
him
.
<EOS>
the
people
at
his
lodging
do
not
even
know
that
he
have
relative
,
and
his
near
relative
hardly
know
that
he
have
lodging
.
<EOS>
even
Kate
have
never
be
at
the
room
in
Cecil
Street
,
and
address
all
her
letter
to
his
place
of
business
or
his
club
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
who
would
bear
no
inquiry
into
himself
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
be
out
of
view
for
a
month
,
and
his
friend
ask
him
where
he
have
be
,
he
always
answer
the
question
falsely
,
or
leave
it
unanswered
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
man
of
whom
everybody
know
all
about
all
their
belonging
;
 
as
to
whom
everybody
know
where
they
live
,
whither
they
go
<EOS>
,
what
be
their
mean
,
and
how
they
spend
it
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
other
of
whom
no
man
know
anything
,
and
George
Vavasor
be
such
a
one
.
<EOS>
for
myself
I
like
the
open
babbler
the
good
.
<EOS>
babbling
may
be
a
weakness
,
but
to
my
thinking
mystery
be
a
vice
.
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
also
maintain
another
little
establishment
,
down
in
Oxfordshire
;
but
the
two
establishment
do
not
even
know
of
each
other
's
existence
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
third
,
too
,
very
closely
hide
from
the
world
's
eye
,
which
shall
be
nameless
;
but
of
the
establishment
in
Oxfordshire
he
do
sometimes
speak
,
in
very
humble
word
,
among
his
friend
.
<EOS>
when
he
find
himself
among
hunt
man
,
he
would
speak
of
his
two
nag
at
Roebury
,
say
that
he
have
never
yet
be
able
to
mount
a
regular
hunting
stable
,
and
that
he
suppose
he
never
would
;
but
that
there
be
at
Roebury
two
indifferent
beast
of
his
if
any
one
choose
to
buy
them
.
<EOS>
and
man
very
often
do
buy
Vavasor
's
horse
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
on
them
they
always
go
well
and
sell
themselves
readily
.
<EOS>
and
though
he
thus
speak
of
two
,
and
perhaps
do
not
keep
more
during
the
summer
,
he
always
seem
to
have
horse
enough
when
he
be
down
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
no
one
even
know
George
Vavasor
not
to
hunt
because
he
be
short
of
stuff
.
<EOS>
and
here
,
at
Roebury
,
he
keep
a
trusty
servant
,
an
ancient
groom
with
two
little
bushy
grey
eye
which
look
as
though
they
could
see
through
a
stable
door
.
<EOS>
many
be
the
long
whispering
which
George
and
Bat
Smithers
carry
on
at
the
stable
door
,
in
the
very
back
depth
of
the
yard
attach
to
the
hunting
inn
at
Roebury
.
<EOS>
Bat
regard
his
master
as
a
man
wholly
devoted
to
horse
,
but
often
wonder
why
he
be
not
more
regular
in
his
sojourning
in
Oxfordshire
.
<EOS>
of
any
other
portion
of
his
master
's
life
Bat
know
nothing
.
<EOS>
Bat
could
give
the
address
of
his
master
's
club
in
London
,
but
he
could
give
no
other
address
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
Vavasor
's
private
lodging
be
so
very
private
,
he
have
,
nevertheless
,
take
some
trouble
in
adorn
them
.
<EOS>
the
furniture
in
the
sitting
-
room
be
very
neat
,
and
the
book
-
shelf
be
fill
with
volume
that
shine
with
gilding
on
their
back
.
<EOS>
the
inkstand
,
the
paper
-
weight
,
the
envelope
case
on
his
writing
-
table
be
all
handsome
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
single
good
portrait
of
a
woman
's
head
hang
on
one
of
his
wall
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
special
place
adapt
for
his
pistol
,
other
for
his
foil
,
and
again
another
for
his
whip
.
<EOS>
the
room
be
as
pretty
a
bachelor
's
room
as
you
would
wish
to
enter
,
but
you
may
see
,
by
the
position
of
the
single
easy
-
chair
that
be
bring
forward
,
that
it
be
seldom
appropriate
to
the
comfort
of
more
than
one
person
.
<EOS>
here
he
sit
lounge
over
his
breakfast
,
late
on
a
Sunday
morning
in
September
,
when
all
the
world
be
out
of
town
.
<EOS>
He
be
read
a
letter
which
have
just
be
bring
down
to
him
from
his
club
.
<EOS>
though
the
writer
of
it
be
his
sister
Kate
,
she
have
not
be
privilege
to
address
it
to
his
private
lodging
.
<EOS>
He
read
it
very
quickly
,
run
rapidly
over
its
content
,
and
then
throw
it
aside
from
him
as
though
it
be
of
no
moment
,
keep
,
however
,
an
enclosure
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
and
yet
the
letter
be
of
much
moment
,
and
make
him
think
deeply
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
do
it
at
all
,
"
say
he
,
"
it
would
be
more
with
the
object
of
cut
him
out
than
with
any
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
reader
will
hardly
require
to
be
tell
that
the
him
in
question
be
John
Grey
,
and
that
Kate
's
letter
be
one
instigate
her
brother
to
renew
his
love
affair
with
Alice
.
<EOS>
and
Vavasor
be
in
truth
well
inclined
to
renew
it
,
and
would
have
begin
the
renew
it
at
once
,
have
he
not
doubt
his
power
with
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
indeed
it
have
be
see
that
he
have
already
attempt
some
commencement
of
such
renewal
at
Basle
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
Kate
more
than
once
that
Alice
's
fortune
be
not
much
,
and
that
her
beauty
be
past
its
prime
;
and
he
would
no
doubt
repeat
the
same
objection
to
his
sister
with
some
pretence
of
disinclination
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
his
custom
to
show
his
hand
to
the
player
at
any
game
that
he
play
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
,
in
truth
,
very
anxious
to
obtain
from
Alice
a
second
promise
of
her
hand
.
<EOS>
how
soon
after
that
he
may
marry
her
,
would
be
another
question
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
not
Alice
's
beauty
that
he
covet
,
nor
yet
her
money
exclusively
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
he
think
her
very
beautiful
,
and
be
fully
aware
that
her
money
would
be
of
great
service
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
I
believe
that
he
be
true
in
that
word
that
he
speak
to
himself
,
and
that
his
chief
attraction
be
the
delight
which
he
would
have
in
rob
Mr.
Grey
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Alice
have
once
be
his
love
,
have
cling
to
his
side
,
have
whisper
love
to
him
,
and
he
have
enough
of
the
weakness
of
humanity
in
him
to
feel
the
soreness
arise
from
her
affection
for
another
.
<EOS>
when
she
break
away
from
him
he
have
acknowledge
that
he
have
be
wrong
,
and
when
,
since
her
engagement
with
Mr.
Grey
,
he
have
congratulate
her
,
he
have
tell
her
in
his
quiet
,
half
-
whisper
,
impressive
word
how
right
she
be
;
but
not
the
less
,
therefore
,
do
he
feel
himself
hurt
that
John
Grey
should
be
her
lover
.
<EOS>
and
when
he
have
meet
this
man
he
have
speak
well
of
him
to
his
sister
,
say
that
he
be
a
gentleman
,
a
scholar
,
and
a
man
of
part
;
but
not
the
less
have
he
hate
him
from
the
first
moment
of
his
see
him
.
<EOS>
such
hatred
under
such
circumstance
be
almost
pardonable
.
<EOS>
but
George
Vavasor
,
when
he
hate
,
be
apt
to
follow
up
his
hatred
with
injury
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
violently
dislike
a
man
and
yet
not
wish
to
do
him
any
harm
.
<EOS>
at
present
,
as
he
sit
lounge
in
his
chair
,
he
think
that
he
would
like
to
marry
his
cousin
Alice
;
but
he
be
quite
sure
that
he
would
like
to
be
the
mean
of
put
a
stop
to
the
propose
marriage
between
Alice
and
John
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
have
be
very
false
to
her
friend
,
and
have
send
up
to
her
brother
the
very
letter
which
Alice
have
write
to
her
after
that
meeting
in
Queen
Anne
Street
which
be
describe
in
the
last
chapter
,
 
or
rather
a
portion
of
it
,
for
with
the
reserve
common
to
woman
she
have
keep
back
the
other
half
.
<EOS>
Alice
have
declare
to
herself
that
she
would
be
sure
of
her
cousin
's
sympathy
,
and
have
write
out
all
her
heart
on
the
matter
,
as
be
her
<EOS>
will
not
when
write
to
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
but
you
must
understand
,
"
she
write
,
"
that
all
that
I
say
to
him
go
with
him
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
have
determine
to
make
him
know
that
everything
between
us
must
be
over
,
but
I
fail
.
<EOS>
I
find
that
I
have
no
word
at
command
,
but
that
he
be
able
to
talk
to
me
as
though
I
be
a
child
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
that
I
be
sick
and
full
of
phantasy
,
and
bade
me
change
the
air
.
<EOS>
as
he
speak
in
this
way
,
I
could
not
help
feel
how
right
he
be
to
use
me
so
;
but
I
feel
also
that
he
,
in
his
mighty
superiority
,
could
never
be
a
fitting
husband
for
a
creature
so
inferior
to
him
as
I
be
.
<EOS>
though
I
altogether
fail
to
make
him
understand
that
it
be
so
,
every
moment
that
we
be
together
make
me
more
fixed
in
my
resolution
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
letter
from
Alice
to
Kate
,
Vavasor
read
over
and
over
again
,
though
Kate
's
letter
to
himself
,
which
be
the
long
one
,
he
have
throw
aside
after
the
first
glance
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
that
he
could
learn
from
that
.
<EOS>
He
be
as
good
a
judge
of
the
manner
in
which
he
would
play
his
own
game
as
Kate
could
be
;
but
in
this
matter
he
be
to
learn
how
he
would
play
his
game
from
a
knowledge
of
the
other
girl
's
mind
.
<EOS>
"
She
will
never
marry
him
,
at
any
rate
,
"
he
say
to
himself
,
"
and
she
be
right
.
<EOS>
He
would
make
an
upper
servant
of
her
;
very
respectable
,
no
doubt
,
but
still
only
an
upper
servant
.
<EOS>
now
with
me
;
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
hardly
know
what
I
should
make
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
of
myself
as
a
man
married
.
<EOS>
"
then
he
throw
her
letter
after
Kate
's
,
and
betook
himself
to
his
newspaper
and
his
cigar
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
two
hour
after
this
,
and
he
still
wear
his
dressing
-
gown
,
and
he
be
still
lounge
in
his
easy
-
chair
,
when
the
waiting
-
maid
at
the
lodging
bring
him
up
word
that
a
gentleman
wish
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
keep
no
servant
of
his
own
except
that
confidential
groom
down
at
Bicester
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
rule
with
him
that
people
could
be
better
serve
and
cheap
serve
by
other
people
's
servant
than
by
their
own
.
<EOS>
even
in
the
stable
at
Bicester
<EOS>
the
innkeeper
have
to
find
what
assistance
be
want
,
and
charge
for
it
in
the
bill
.
<EOS>
and
George
Vavasor
be
no
Sybarite
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
deem
it
impracticable
to
put
on
his
own
trouser
without
have
a
man
stand
at
his
foot
to
hold
up
the
leg
of
the
garment
.
<EOS>
a
valet
about
a
man
know
a
great
deal
of
a
man
's
way
,
and
therefore
George
have
no
valet
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
gentleman
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
to
the
girl
.
<EOS>
"
do
the
gentleman
look
like
a
public
-
house
keeper
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
think
he
do
,
"
say
the
girl
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
show
him
up
,
"
say
George
.
  
<EOS>
and
the
gentleman
be
a
public
-
house
keeper
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
be
pretty
sure
of
his
visitor
before
he
desire
the
servant
to
give
him
entrance
.
<EOS>
It
be
Mr.
Grimes
from
the
"
Handsome
Man
"
public
-
house
and
tavern
,
in
the
Brompton
Road
,
and
he
have
come
by
appointment
to
have
a
little
conversation
with
Mr.
Vavasor
on
matter
political
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grimes
be
a
man
who
know
that
business
be
business
,
and
as
such
have
some
considerable
weight
in
his
own
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
with
him
politic
be
business
,
as
well
as
beer
,
and
omnibus
-
horse
,
and
foreign
wine
;
 
in
the
fabrication
of
which
latter
article
<EOS>
Mr.
Grimes
be
suppose
to
have
an
extended
experience
.
<EOS>
to
such
as
him
,
when
intent
on
business
,
Mr.
Vavasor
be
not
averse
to
make
known
the
secret
of
his
lodging
-
house
;
and
now
,
when
the
idle
of
London
world
be
either
at
morning
church
or
still
in
bed
,
Mr.
Grimes
have
come
out
by
appointment
to
do
a
little
political
business
with
the
lately
-
reject
member
for
the
Chelsea
Districts
.
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
have
be
,
as
I
have
say
,
lately
reject
,
and
the
new
member
who
have
beat
him
at
the
hustings
have
sit
now
for
one
session
in
parliament
.
<EOS>
under
his
present
reign
he
be
destine
to
the
honour
of
one
other
session
,
and
then
the
period
of
his
exist
glory
,
 
for
which
he
be
say
to
have
pay
nearly
six
thousand
pound
,
 
would
be
over
.
<EOS>
but
he
may
be
elect
again
,
perhaps
for
a
full
period
of
six
session
;
and
it
may
be
hope
that
this
second
election
would
be
conduct
on
more
economical
principle
.
<EOS>
to
this
,
the
economical
view
of
the
matter
,
Mr.
Grimes
be
very
much
opposed
,
and
be
now
wait
upon
George
Vavasor
in
Cecil
Street
,
chiefly
with
the
object
of
oppose
the
new
member
's
wish
on
this
head
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
Mr.
Grimes
be
personally
an
advocate
for
the
return
of
Mr.
Vavasor
,
and
would
do
all
in
his
power
to
prevent
the
re
-
election
of
the
young
Lord
Kilfenora
,
whose
father
,
the
Marquis
of
Bunratty
,
<EOS>
have
scatter
that
six
thousand
pound
among
the
elector
and
non
-
elector
of
Chelsea
;
but
his
main
object
be
that
money
should
be
spend
.
"
<EOS>
"
tain't
altogether
for
myself
,
"
he
say
to
a
confidential
friend
in
the
same
way
of
business
;
"
I
do
not
get
so
much
on
it
.
<EOS>
perhaps
sometimes
not
none
.
<EOS>
May
be
<EOS>
I
have
a
bill
agin
some
of
those
gent
not
pay
this
werry
moment
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
the
game
<EOS>
I
look
to
.
<EOS>
if
the
game
die
away
,
it
will
never
be
get
up
again
;
 
never
.
<EOS>
who
will
care
about
election
then
?
<EOS>
Anybody'd
go
and
get
hisself
elect
<EOS>
if
we
be
to
let
the
game
go
by
!
"
<EOS>
and
so
,
that
the
game
may
not
go
by
,
Mr.
Grimes
be
now
present
in
Mr.
George
Vavasor
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
Mr.
Grimes
,
"
say
George
,
"
how
be
you
this
morning
?
<EOS>
sit
down
,
Mr.
Grimes
.
<EOS>
if
every
man
be
as
punctual
as
you
be
,
the
world
would
go
like
clock

work
;
would
not
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
business
be
business
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
"
say
the
publican
,
after
have
make
his
salute
,
and
have
take
his
chair
with
some
little
show
of
mock
modesty
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
my
maxim
.
<EOS>
if
I
do
not
stick
to
that
,
nothing
would
not
ever
stick
to
me
;
and
nothing
do
not
much
as
it
be
.
<EOS>
Times
be
very
bad
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
they
be
.
<EOS>
They
be
always
bad
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
Devil
make
for
,
except
that
they
should
be
bad
?
<EOS>
but
I
should
have
think
you
publican
be
the
last
man
who
ought
to
complain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
love
you
,
Mr.
Vavasor
;
why
,
I
suppose
of
all
the
man
as
be
put
upon

we
be
put
upon
the
bad
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
good
of
drawing
of
beer
,
if
the
more
you
draw
the
more
you
do
not
make

<EOS>
yesterday
as
ever
be
be
Saturday
,
and
we
draw
three
pound
ten
and
nine

<EOS>
what
will
that
come
to
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
when
you
reckon
it
up
with
the
brewer

why

it
be
a
next
to
nothing

You
know

You

there
be
a
risk
in
all
these
thing

be
not
there
,
Mr.
Vavasor
?
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
see
you
a
Parliament
gent
;
I
should
indeed
.
<EOS>
You
would
be
a
credit
to
the
district

I
really
think
you
would

"
  
<EOS>

I
be
much
oblige
by

good
opinion

Mr.

George

"
when
I
see
a

forward
I
know
whether

<EOS>
I
say
you
be
fit

<EOS>
but
Lord
love
you

Mr.

it
be
a
thing
a
gentleman
always
have
to
pay
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
enough
;
a
deal
more
than
it
be
worth

generally

"
a
thing
's
worth
what
it
fetch

I
be
worth
what
I
will
fetch

that
be
the
long
and
the
short
of
it

<EOS>
I
want
to
have
my
balance
<EOS>
,
that
be
the
truth

<EOS>
It
be
the
odd
money
in
a
man
's
bill

always
carry
the
profit
.
<EOS>
You
ask
Mr.
Scruby
else
;
 
only
with
a
lawyer
<EOS>
it
be
all
profit
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
what
you
know
about
it

if
you
cut
off
a
man
's
odd
money
,
"
continue
the

"
you
break
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
would
almost
sooner
have
that
and
leave
the
other
standing
.
<EOS>
He
would
call
the
hundred
capital
,
and
if
he
lose
them
at
last
,
why
he
would
put
it
down
as
be
in
the
way
of
trade
.
<EOS>
but
the
odd
money
;
 
he
look
at
that
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
as
in
a
manner
the
very
sweat
of
his
brow
,
the
work
of
his
own
hand
;
that
be
what
go
to
his
family
,
and
keep
the
pot
a
boiling
down

stair

<EOS>
never
stop
a
man
's
odd
money
,
Mr.

that
is
,
unless
he
come
it
very
strong
indeed

<EOS>

what
be
it
you
want
now
?
"

Scruby

<EOS>
"
I
want
ninety

two
pound
thirteen

fourpence

Mr.

will
go

at
all

it
be
quite
time

it
be
indeed
,
Mr.

<EOS>
"
  
"
and
what
you
mean
us
to
understand
be
,
that
you
will
not
begin
at
all
without
your
money

the
lawyer

that
be
about
it

take
a
fifty

Grimes

<EOS>

fifty

George

<EOS>
not

fifty

Mr.

It
be
the
odd
money
that
I
want

<EOS>
I
do
not
mind
the
thirteen
and
four
,
because
that
be
neither
here
nor
there
among
friend
,
but
if
I
do
not
get
all
them
<EOS>
ninety
-
two
pound
<EOS>
I
should
be
a
break
-
hearted
man
;
I
should
indeed
,
Mr.

<EOS>
I
could
not
go
about
your
work
for
next
year
so
as
to
do
you
justice
among
the
elector

<EOS>
I
could
not
indeed

<EOS>
"
You
would
better
give
him
a
bill
for
ninety
pound
at
three
month
,
Mr.

have
no
doubt
he
have
get
a
stamp
in

that
I
have
,
Mr.

there
be

a

a
thing
that
often
turn
up
convenient
with
gent
as
mean
business
like
Mr.

you

you
must
make
it
ninety

two

you
must
indeed
,
Mr.

<EOS>
and
do
make
it
two
month
if
you
can
,
Mr.

;
they
do
charge
so
unconscionable
on
ninety
day
at
them
branch
bank
;
they
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
and
Mr.
Scruby
,
between
them
,
yield
at
last
,
so
far
as
to
allow
the
bill
to
be
draw
for
ninety
-
two
pound
,
but
they
be
stanch
as
to
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
if
it
must
be
,
it
must
,
"
say
the
publican
,
with
a
deep
sigh
,
as
he
fold
up
the
paper
and
put
it
into
the
pocket
of
a
huge
case
which
he
carry
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
now
,
gent
,
I
will
tell
you
what
it
be
.
<EOS>
We
will
make
safe
work
of
this
here
next
election
.
<EOS>
We
know
what
be
to
be
our
little
game
in
time
,
and
if
we
do
not
go
in
and
win
,
my
name
be
not
Jacob
Grimes
,
and
I
be
not
the
landlord
of
the
"
Handsome
Man

<EOS>
"
as
you
gent
have
perhaps
get
something
to
say
among
yourself
,
I
will
make
so
bold
as
to
wish
you
good
morning

"
<EOS>
so
,
with
that
,
Mr.
Grimes
lift
his
hat
from
the
floor
,
and
bow
himself
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
could
not
have
do
it
cheap

you

the
lawyer

as
soon
as
the
sound
of
the
closing
front
door
have
be
hear
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
not
;
but
what
a
thief
the
man
be
!
<EOS>
I
remember
your
tell
me
that
the

be
about
the
most
preposterous
you
have
ever
see

<EOS>
"
so
it
be
,
and
if
we
have
not
want
him
again
of
course
we
should
not
have
pay
him
.
<EOS>

we
will
have
it
all
off
his
next
account

Mr.

every

of
it

all

<EOS>

true

if
you
look
at
it
in

light

it

quite
true

you
see
we
can
not
do
without
him

<EOS>
if
he
have
not
get
your
bill

he
would
have
go
over
to
the
other
fellow
before
the
week
be
over
;
and
the
bad
of
it
would
have
be
that
he
know
our
hand
.
<EOS>
look
at
it
all
round
you
have
get
him
cheap
,
Mr.
Vavasor
;
 
you
have
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
look
at
it
all
round
be
just
what
I
do
not
like
,
Mr.
Scruby
,
but
if
a
man
will
have
a
whistle
,
he
must
pay
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
do
it
cheap
for
any
of
these
metropolitan
seat
;
you
can
not
,
indeed
,
Mr.
Vavasor

<EOS>
that
is
,
a
new
man
can
not
.
<EOS>
when
you
have
be
in
four

five

Duncombe

why
then
,
of
course
,
you
may
snap
your
finger
at
such
man

the
Chelsea
district
be
not
dear

<EOS>
I
do
not
call
them
by
any

<EOS>
now

so
be

It

nasty

only
that
I

I
could
tell
you

ah
!
<EOS>
the
game
be
hardly
worth
the

I

<EOS>

that
depend
on
what
way
you
choose

<EOS>
a

a
great
thing
to
a
man

want
to
make
his

to
me

I
will
not

you

<EOS>
with
that

he
get
up
and
bow
the
attorney
out
of
the
room

with
just
a
little
more
ceremony
than
he
have
show
to
the
publican

Vavasor

take
out

book
from
his

an
entry

<EOS>
Kate
Vavasor
have
send
to

only
the
first
half

her
cousin

letter

that
half
in

Alice
have

to
describe
what
have
take
place
between
her

<EOS>
in

Kate
have
be
a
wicked
traitor

a
traitor
to
that
feminine
faith
against
which
treason
on
the
part
of
one
woman
be
always
unpardonable
in
the

treason
would

portion

in
that
Alice
have
speak
of
George
Vavasor
himself

but
even
of
this
treason
,
Kate
would
,
I
think
,
have
be
guilty
,
have
the
word
which
Alice
write
be
of
a
nature
to
serve
her
own
purpose
if
read
by
her
brother
.
<EOS>
but
they
have
not
be
of
this
nature

<EOS>
They
have
speak
of
George
as
a
man
with
whom
any
close
connection
than
that
which
exist
at
present
be
impossible
,
and
have
be
write
with
the

of
beg
Kate
to
desist
from

futile
attempt
in

direction

<EOS>
"
I

myself

you

this

the

Kate
have
say

she
read

She
be
obstinately
persistent

she
be

unscrupulous

she
be
not

<EOS>
many
year

she
have
make
up
her
mind
that
George

Alice

man

such
a

would
be
good

almost
bring
about

have
then
be
hinder
altogether

she
have
forgive
him
this
sin

she

forgive
many
other

She
answer
Alice

a
pleasant

gossip

how
difficult
it
be
to
deal

therefore
I
sit
down
to
answer

fear

trembling

should
say
a

too
much

thereby
drive

not

quite
enough

fail

how
can
I
not
be
glad
?
<EOS>
It
be
no
use
say
that
he
be
good
and
noble
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
deny
it
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
not
suit
to
you
,
and
his
life
would
have
make
you
wretched
.
<EOS>
ergo
,
I
rejoice
.
<EOS>
and
as
you
be
the
dear
friend
I
have
,
of
course
I
rejoice
mightily
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
understand
accurately
the
sort
of
way
in
which
the
interview
go
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
have
the
good
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
see
him
so
plainly
as
he
stand
up
in
unruffled
self
-
possession
,
ignore
all
that
you
say
,
suggest
that
you
be
feverish
or
perhaps
bilious
,
wave
his
hand
over
you
a
little
,
as
though
that
may
possibly
do
you
some
small
good
,
and
then
take
his
leave
with
an
assurance
that
it
would
be
all
right
as
soon
as
the
wind
change
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
be
very
noble
in
him
,
not
take
you
at
your
word
,
and
give
you
,
as
it
be
,
another
chance
;
but
there
be
a
kind
of
nobility
which
be
almost
too
great
for
this
world
.
<EOS>
I
think
very
well
of
you
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
as
woman
go
,
but
I
do
not
think
well
enough
of
you
to
believe
that
you
be
fit
to
be
Mr.
John
Grey
's
wife
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
I
be
very
glad
.
<EOS>
You
have
know
my
mind
from
the
first
to
the
last
,
and
,
therefore
,
what
would
be
the
good
of
my
mincing
matter
?
<EOS>
no
woman
wish
her
dear
friend
to
marry
a
man
to
whom
she
herself
be
antipathetic
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
be
as
much
lose
to
me
,
have
you
become
Mrs.
Grey
of
Nethercoats
,
Cambridgeshire
,
as
though
you
have
go
to
heaven
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
but
what
Nethercoats
may
be
a
kind
of
heaven
,
 
but
then
one
do
not
wish
one
's
friend
that
distant
sort
of
happiness
.
<EOS>
a
flat
Eden
I
can
fancy
it
,
hem
in
by
broad
dyke
,
in
which
cream
and
egg
be
very
plentiful
,
where
an
Adam
and
an
Eve
may
drink
the
choice
tea
out
of
the
fine
china
,
with
toast
butter
to
perfection
,
from
year
's
end
to
year
's
end
;
into
which
no
money
trouble
would
ever
find
their
way
,
nor
yet
any
naughty
novel
.
<EOS>
but
such
an
Eden
be
not
tempting
to
me
,
nor
,
as
I
think
,
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
can
fancy
you
stretch
your
poor
neck
over
the
dyke
,
long
to
fly
away
that
you
may
cease
to
be
at
rest
,
but
know
that
the
matrimonial
dragon
be
too
strong
for
any
such
flight
.
<EOS>
if
ever
bird
bang
his
wing
to
piece
against
gilded
bar
,
you
would
have
bang
yours
to
piece
in
that
cage
.
  
<EOS>
You
say
that
you
have
fail
to
make
him
understand
that
the
matter
be
settle
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
say
that
of
course
it
be
settle
,
and
that
he
must
be
make
to
understand
it
.
<EOS>
You
owe
it
to
him
now
to
put
him
out
of
all
doubt
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
I
suppose
,
accessible
to
the
word
of
a
mortal
,
god
though
he
be
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
fear
about
this
,
for
,
after
all
,
you
have
as
much
firmness
about
you
as
most
people
;
 
perhaps
as
much
as
he
have
at
bottom
,
though
you
may
not
have
so
many
occasion
to
show
it
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
that
other
matter
I
can
only
say
that
you
shall
be
oblige
,
as
far
as
it
be
in
my
power
to
obey
you
.
<EOS>
for
what
may
come
out
from
me
by
word
of
mouth
when
we
be
together
,
I
will
not
answer
with
certainty
.
<EOS>
but
my
pen
be
under
well
control
,
and
it
shall
not
write
the
offending
name
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
I
must
tell
you
a
little
about
myself
;
 
or
rather
<EOS>
,
I
be
incline
to
spin
a
yarn
,
and
tell
you
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
I
have
get
such
a
lover
!
<EOS>
but
I
do
describe
him
before
.
<EOS>
of
course
it
be
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
to
say
he
have
not
declare
himself
,
I
should
hardly
give
you
a
fair
idea
of
my
success
.
<EOS>
and
yet
he
have
not
declare
himself
,
 
and
,
which
be
bad
,
be
very
anxious
to
marry
a
rival
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
strong
point
in
my
favour
that
my
rival
want
him
to
take
me
,
and
that
he
will
assuredly
be
drive
to
make
me
an
offer
sooner
or
later
,
in
obedience
to
her
order
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
be
my
rival
,
and
I
do
not
feel
the
least
doubt
as
to
his
have
offer
to
her
half
a
dozen
time
.
<EOS>
but
then
she
have
another
lover
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
and
I
see
that
she
prefer
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
penniless
scamp
and
look
as
though
he
drink
.
<EOS>
He
paint
his
whisker
too
,
which
I
do
not
like
;
and
,
be
forty
,
try
to
look
like
twenty
-
five
.
<EOS>
otherwise
he
be
agreeable
enough
,
and
I
rather
approve
of
my
aunt
's
taste
in
prefer
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
my
lover
have
solid
attraction
,
and
allure
me
on
by
a
description
of
the
fat
cattle
which
he
send
to
market
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
of
substance
,
and
should
I
ever
become
Mrs.
Cheesacre
<EOS>
,
I
have
reason
to
think
that
I
shall
not
be
leave
in
want
.
<EOS>
We
go
up
to
his
place
on
a
visit
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
Oileymead
be
the
name
of
my
future
home
;
 
not
so
pretty
as
Nethercoats
,
be
it
?
<EOS>
and
we
have
such
a
time
there
!
<EOS>
We
reach
the
place
at
ten
and
leave
it
at
four
,
and
he
manage
to
give
us
three
meal
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
we
have
before
our
eye
at
different
time
every
bit
of
china
,
delf
,
glass
,
and
plate
in
the
establishment
.
<EOS>
He
make
us
go
into
the
cellar
,
and
tell
us
how
much
wine
he
have
get
there
,
and
how
much
beer
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
pay
for
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
every
bottle
of
it
,
"
he
say
,
turn
round
to
my
aunt
,
with
a
pathetic
earnestness
,
for
which
I
have
hardly
give
him
credit
.
<EOS>
"
everything
in
this
house
be
my
own
;
it
be
all
pay
for
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
call
anything
a
man
's
own
till
it
be
pay
for
.
<EOS>
now
that
jacket
that
Bellfield
swell
about
with
on
the
sand
at
Yarmouth
,
 
<EOS>
that
be
not
his
own
,
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
not
like
to
be
either
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
wink
his
eye
as
though
bid
my
aunt
to
think
of
that
before
she
encourage
such
a
lover
as
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
He
take
us
into
every
bedroom
,
and
disclose
to
us
all
the
glory
of
his
upper
chamber
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
do
you
good
to
see
him
lift
the
counterpane
,
and
bid
my
aunt
feel
the
texture
of
the
blanket
!
<EOS>
and
then
to
see
her
turn
round
to
me
and
say
:
 
"
Kate
,
it
be
simply
the
best
-
furnished
house
I
ever
go
over
in
my
life
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
do
seem
very
comfortable
,
"
say
I.
"
comfortable
!
"
<EOS>
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
I
do
not
think
there
be
<EOS>
anybody
can
say
that
Oileymead
be
not
comfortable
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
so
think
of
you
and
Nethercoats
.
<EOS>
the
attraction
be
the
same
;
 
only
in
the
one
place
you
would
have
a
god
for
your
keeper
,
and
in
the
other
a
brute
.
<EOS>
for
myself
,
if
ever
I
be
to
have
a
keeper
at
all
,
I
shall
prefer
a
man
.
<EOS>
but
when
we
get
to
the
farmyard
his
eloquence
reach
the
high
pitch
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
say
he
,
"
look
at
that
,
"
and
he
point
to
heap
of
manure
raise
like
the
street
of
a
little
city
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
look
at
that
!
"
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
great
deal
,
"
say
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
more
muck
upon
this
place
here
than
any
farmer
in
Norfolk
,
gentle
or
simple
;
I
do
not
care
who
the
other
be
.
"
<EOS>
only
fancy
,
Alice
<EOS>
;
it
may
all
be
mine
;
the
blanket
,
the
wine
,
the
muck
,
and
the
rest
of
it
.
<EOS>
so
my
aunt
assure
me
when
we
get
home
that
evening
.
<EOS>
when
I
remark
that
the
wealth
have
be
exhibit
to
her
and
not
to
me
,
she
do
not
affect
to
deny
it
,
but
treat
that
as
a
matter
of
no
moment
.
"
<EOS>
He
want
a
wife
,
my
dear
,
"
she
say
,
"
and
you
may
pick
him
up
to
-
morrow
by
put
out
your
hand
.
<EOS>
"
when
I
remark
that
his
mind
seem
to
be
intent
on
low
thing
,
and
specially
name
the
muck
,
she
only
laugh
at
me
.
<EOS>
"
money
be
never
dirty
,
"
she
say
,
"
nor
yet
what
make
money
.
"
<EOS>
She
talk
of
take
lodging
in
Norwich
for
the
winter
,
say
that
in
her
widowed
state
she
will
be
as
well
there
as
anywhere
else
,
and
she
want
me
to
stay
with
her
up
to
Christmas
.
<EOS>
indeed
she
first
propose
the
Norwich
plan
on
the
ground
that
it
may
be
useful
to
me
,
 
with
a
view
to
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
of
course
;
but
I
fancy
that
she
be
unwilling
to
tear
herself
away
from
Captain
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
to
Norwich
she
will
go
,
and
I
have
promise
not
to
leave
her
before
the
second
week
in
November
.
<EOS>
with
all
her
absurdity
I
like
her
.
<EOS>
Her
fault
be
terrible
fault
,
but
she
have
not
the
fault
of
hide
them
by
falsehood
.
<EOS>
She
be
never
stupid
,
and
she
be
very
good
-
natured
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
allow
me
to
equip
myself
from
head
to
foot
at
her
expense
,
if
I
would
have
accept
her
liberality
,
and
absolutely
offer
to
give
me
my
trousseau
if
I
would
marry
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
I
live
in
the
hope
that
you
will
come
down
to
the
old
place
at
Christmas
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
offend
you
more
than
I
can
help
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
he
will
not
be
there
.
<EOS>
and
if
I
do
not
see
you
there
,
where
be
I
to
see
you
?
<EOS>
if
I
be
you
I
would
certainly
not
go
to
Cheltenham
.
<EOS>
You
be
never
happy
there
.
  
<EOS>
do
you
ever
dream
of
the
river
at
Basle
?
<EOS>
I
do
;
 
so
often
.
  
<EOS>
most
affectionately
yours
,
  
KATE
VAVASOR
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
have
almost
lose
the
sensation
create
by
the
former
portion
of
Kate
's
letter
by
the
fun
of
the
latter
,
before
she
have
quite
make
that
sensation
her
own
.
<EOS>
the
picture
of
the
Cambridgeshire
Eden
would
have
displease
her
have
she
dwelt
upon
it
,
and
the
allusion
to
the
cream
and
toast
would
have
have
the
very
opposite
effect
to
that
which
Kate
have
intend
.
<EOS>
perhaps
Kate
have
feel
this
,
and
have
therefore
merge
it
all
in
her
story
about
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
to
Cheltenham
,
"
she
say
to
herself
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
recommend
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
his
wife
;
 
but
,
till
we
have
part
altogether
,
I
will
show
him
that
I
think
well
of
his
advice
.
<EOS>
"
that
same
afternoon
she
tell
her
father
that
she
would
go
to
Lady
Macleod
's
at
Cheltenham
before
the
end
of
the
month
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
in
truth
,
prompt
to
this
by
a
resolution
,
of
which
she
be
herself
hardly
conscious
,
that
she
would
not
at
this
period
of
her
life
be
in
any
way
guide
by
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
have
make
up
her
mind
about
Mr.
Grey
,
it
be
right
that
she
should
let
her
cousin
know
her
purpose
;
but
she
would
never
be
drive
to
confess
to
herself
that
Kate
have
influence
her
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
She
would
go
to
Cheltenham
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
would
no
doubt
vex
her
by
hourly
solicitation
that
the
match
may
be
renew
;
but
,
if
she
know
herself
,
she
have
strength
to
withstand
Lady
Macleod
.
  
<EOS>
She
receive
one
letter
from
Mr.
Grey
before
the
time
come
for
her
departure
,
and
she
answer
it
,
tell
him
of
her
intention
;
 
tell
him
also
that
she
now
feel
herself
bind
to
explain
to
her
father
her
present
position
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
this
,
"
she
say
,
"
in
consequence
of
what
you
say
to
me
on
the
matter
.
<EOS>
My
father
will
know
it
to
-
morrow
,
and
on
the
follow
morning
I
shall
start
for
Cheltenham
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
from
Lady
Macleod
and
she
expect
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
on
the
follow
morning
she
do
tell
her
father
,
stand
by
him
as
he
sit
at
his
breakfast
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
put
down
his
tea
-
cup
and
look
up
into
her
face
;
"
what
!
<EOS>
not
marry
John
Grey
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
papa
;
I
know
how
strange
you
must
think
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
say
that
there
have
be
no
quarrel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
there
have
be
no
quarrel
.
<EOS>
by
degree
I
have
learn
to
feel
that
I
should
not
make
him
happy
as
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
d
 
<EOS>
---
d
nonsense
,
"
say
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
now
such
an
expression
as
this
from
him
,
address
to
his
daughter
,
show
that
he
be
very
deeply
move
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
papa
!
<EOS>
do
not
talk
to
me
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
.
<EOS>
I
never
hear
such
trash
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
if
he
come
to
me
I
shall
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
not
make
him
happy
!
<EOS>
why
can
not
you
make
him
happy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
not
suited
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
be
the
matter
with
him
?
<EOS>
He
be
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
he
be
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
a
man
of
honour
,
and
with
good
mean
,
and
with
all
that
knowledge
and
reading
which
you
profess
to
like
.
<EOS>
look
here
,
Alice
;
I
be
not
go
to
interfere
,
nor
shall
I
attempt
to
make
you
marry
anyone
.
<EOS>
You
be
your
own
mistress
as
far
as
that
be
concern
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
hope
,
for
your
sake
and
for
mine
,
 
I
do
hope
that
there
be
nothing
again
between
you
and
your
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
your
go
abroad
with
him
,
though
I
do
not
choose
to
interrupt
your
plan
by
say
so
.
<EOS>
but
if
there
be
anything
of
that
kind
go
on
,
I
should
be
bind
to
tell
you
that
your
cousin
's
position
at
present
be
not
a
good
one
.
<EOS>
man
do
not
speak
well
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
between
us
,
papa
;
but
if
there
be
,
man
speak
ill
of
him
would
not
deter
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
man
speak
well
of
Mr.
Grey
will
not
do
the
other
thing
.
<EOS>
I
know
very
well
that
woman
can
be
obstinate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
come
to
this
resolution
without
think
much
about
it
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
.
<EOS>
well
;
 
I
can
not
say
anything
more
.
<EOS>
You
be
your
own
mistress
,
and
your
fortune
be
in
your
own
keeping
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
make
you
marry
John
Grey
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
very
foolish
,
and
if
he
come
to
me
I
shall
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
You
be
go
down
to
Cheltenham
,
be
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
papa
;
I
have
promise
Lady
Macleod
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
.
<EOS>
I
would
sooner
it
should
be
you
than
me
;
that
be
all
I
can
say
.
<EOS>
"
then
he
take
up
his
newspaper
,
thereby
show
that
he
have
nothing
further
to
say
on
the
matter
,
and
Alice
leave
him
alone
.
  
<EOS>
the
whole
thing
be
so
vexatious
that
even
Mr.
Vavasor
be
disturb
by
it
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
not
term
time
he
have
no
signing
to
do
in
Chancery
Lane
,
and
could
not
,
therefore
,
bury
his
unhappiness
in
his
daily
labour
,
 
or
rather
in
his
labour
that
be
by
no
means
daily
.
<EOS>
so
he
sit
at
home
till
four
o'clock
,
express
to
himself
in
various
phrase
his
wonder
that
"
any
man
alive
should
ever
rear
a
daughter
.
"
<EOS>
and
when
he
get
to
his
club
the
waiter
find
him
quite
unmanageable
about
his
dinner
,
which
he
eat
alone
,
reject
all
proposition
of
companionship
.
<EOS>
but
later
in
the
evening
he
regain
his
composure
over
a
glass
of
whiskey
-
toddy
and
a
cigar
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
get
her
own
money
,
"
he
say
to
himself
,
"
and
what
do
it
matter
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
she
will
marry
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
she
be
fool
enough
for
that
.
<EOS>
and
after
all
she
will
probably
make
it
up
again
with
John
Grey
.
"
<EOS>
and
in
this
way
he
determine
that
he
may
let
this
annoyance
run
off
him
,
and
that
he
need
not
as
a
father
take
the
trouble
of
any
interference
.
  
<EOS>
but
while
he
be
at
his
club
there
come
a
visitor
to
Queen
Anne
Street
,
and
that
visitor
be
the
dangerous
cousin
of
whom
,
accord
to
his
uncle
's
testimony
,
man
at
present
do
not
speak
well
.
<EOS>
Alice
have
not
see
him
since
they
have
part
on
the
day
of
their
arrival
in
London
,
 
nor
,
indeed
,
have
hear
of
his
whereabouts
.
<EOS>
in
the
consternation
of
her
mind
at
this
step
which
she
be
take
,
 
a
step
which
she
have
teach
herself
to
regard
as
essentially
her
duty
before
it
be
take
,
but
which
seem
to
herself
to
be
false
and
treacherous
<EOS>
the
moment
she
have
take
it
<EOS>
,
 
she
have
become
aware
that
she
have
be
wrong
to
travel
with
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
She
feel
sure
,
 
she
think
that
she
be
sure
,
 
that
her
do
so
<EOS>
have
in
nowise
affect
her
dealing
with
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
certain
,
 
<EOS>
she
think
that
she
be
certain
,
 
that
she
would
have
reject
him
just
the
same
<EOS>
have
she
never
go
to
Switzerland
.
<EOS>
but
every
one
would
say
of
her
that
her
journey
to
Switzerland
with
such
companion
have
produce
that
result
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
unlucky
and
she
be
sorry
for
it
,
and
she
now
wish
to
avoid
all
communication
with
her
cousin
till
this
affair
should
be
altogether
over
.
<EOS>
She
be
especially
unwilling
to
see
him
;
but
she
have
not
feel
it
necessary
to
give
any
special
injunction
as
to
his
admittance
;
and
now
,
before
she
have
time
to
think
of
it
,
 
on
the
eve
of
her
departure
for
Cheltenham
,
 
<EOS>
he
be
in
the
room
with
her
,
just
as
the
dusk
of
the
October
evening
be
come
on
.
<EOS>
She
be
sit
away
from
the
fire
,
almost
behind
the
window
-
curtain
,
think
of
John
Grey
and
very
unhappy
in
her
thought
,
when
George
Vavasor
be
announce
.
<EOS>
It
will
of
course
be
understand
that
Vavasor
have
at
this
time
receive
his
sister
's
letter
.
<EOS>
He
have
receive
it
,
and
have
have
time
to
consider
the
matter
since
the
Sunday
morning
on
which
we
see
him
in
his
own
room
in
Cecil
Street
.
<EOS>
"
She
can
turn
it
all
into
capital
to
-
morrow
,
if
she
please
,
"
he
have
say
to
himself
when
think
of
her
income
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
also
remind
himself
that
her
grandfather
would
probably
enable
him
to
settle
an
income
out
of
the
property
upon
Alice
,
in
the
event
of
their
be
marry
.
<EOS>
and
then
he
have
also
feel
that
he
could
have
no
great
triumph
than
"
walk
atop
of
John
Grey
,
"
as
he
call
it
.
<EOS>
His
return
for
the
Chelsea
Districts
would
hardly
be
sweet
to
him
than
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
think
I
have
vanish
out
of
the
world
,
"
say
George
,
come
up
to
her
with
his
extended
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
be
confused
,
and
hardly
know
how
to
address
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
somebody
tell
me
that
you
be
shoot
,
"
she
say
after
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
be
,
but
my
shooting
be
not
like
the
shooting
of
your
great
nimrod
,
 
man
who
be
hunter
upon
the
earth
.
<EOS>
two
day
among
the
grouse
and
two
more
among
the
partridge
be
about
the
extent
of
it
.
<EOS>
Capel
Court
be
the
preserve
in
which
I
be
usually
to
be
find
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
know
nothing
of
Capel
Court
,
and
say
,
"
<EOS>
oh
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
hear
from
Kate
?
"
George
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
once
or
twice
;
she
be
still
at
Yarmouth
with
Aunt
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
be
go
to
Norwich
,
as
she
say
.
<EOS>
Kate
seem
to
have
make
a
league
with
Aunt
Greenow
.
<EOS>
I
,
who
do
not
pretend
to
be
very
disintereste
in
money
matter
,
think
that
she
be
quite
right
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
Aunt
Greenow
may
marry
again
,
but
friend
with
forty
thousand
pound
be
always
agreeable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
that
Kate
think
much
of
that
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
so
much
as
she
ought
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
poor
Kate
be
not
a
rich
woman
,
or
,
I
fear
,
likely
to
become
one
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
seem
to
dream
of
get
marry
,
and
her
own
fortune
be
less
than
a
hundred
a
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
girl
who
never
dream
of
get
married
be
just
those
who
make
the
good
marriage
at
last
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
perhaps
so
,
<EOS>
but
I
wish
I
be
easy
about
Kate
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
good
sister
a
man
ever
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
she
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
have
do
nothing
for
her
as
yet
.
<EOS>
I
do
think
,
while
I
be
in
that
wine
business
,
that
I
could
have
do
anything
I
please
for
her
.
<EOS>
but
my
grandfather
's
obstinacy
put
me
out
of
that
;
and
now
I
be
begin
the
world
again
,
 
that
is
,
comparatively
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
you
think
I
be
wrong
in
try
to
get
into
Parliament
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
quite
right
.
<EOS>
I
admire
you
for
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
just
what
I
would
do
in
your
place
.
<EOS>
You
be
unmarried
,
and
have
a
right
to
run
the
risk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
to
hear
you
speak
like
that
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
He
have
now
manage
to
take
up
that
friendly
,
confidential
,
almost
affectionate
tone
of
talk
which
he
have
so
often
use
when
abroad
with
her
,
and
which
he
have
fail
to
assume
when
first
enter
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
have
never
say
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
have
not
I
?
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
heartily
like
that
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
people
abuse
me
;
 
<EOS>
my
own
people
,
my
grandfather
,
and
probably
your
father
,
 
say
that
I
be
reckless
and
the
rest
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
risk
everything
for
my
object
;
but
I
do
not
know
that
any
one
can
blame
me
,
 
unless
it
be
Kate
.
<EOS>
to
whom
else
do
I
owe
anything
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Kate
do
not
blame
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
she
sympathize
with
me
;
<EOS>
she
,
and
she
only
,
unless
it
be
you
.
"
<EOS>
then
he
pause
for
an
answer
,
but
she
make
him
none
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
be
brave
enough
to
give
me
her
hearty
sympathy
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
for
that
very
reason
I
ought
to
be
the
more
chary
in
endanger
the
only
support
that
she
be
like
to
have
.
<EOS>
what
be
ninety
pound
a
year
for
the
maintenance
of
a
single
lady
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
that
Kate
will
always
live
with
me
,
"
say
Alice
;
"
that
is
,
as
soon
as
she
have
lose
her
home
at
Vavasor
Hall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
be
very
crafty
and
have
lay
a
trap
for
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
lay
a
trap
for
her
,
and
she
have
fall
into
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
determine
not
to
be
induce
to
talk
of
herself
;
but
he
have
bring
the
thing
round
so
cunningly
that
the
word
be
out
of
her
mouth
before
she
remember
whither
they
would
lead
her
.
<EOS>
She
do
remember
this
as
she
be
speak
them
,
but
then
it
be
too
late
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
;
 
at
Nethercoats
?
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
neither
she
nor
I
doubt
your
love
,
but
few
man
would
like
such
an
intruder
as
that
into
their
household
,

of
all
man
Mr.
Grey

nature

would

it
the
least

be
not

Alice

"
ah
,
no
;
that
be
it
,
you
see

Kate
say
so
often
to
me
that
when
you
be
married
she
will
be
alone
in
the
world

<EOS>

I
do
not

myself
from
her

no

not
by
any
will
of
your
own

poor
Kate
!
<EOS>
You
can
not
be
surprised
that
she
should
think
of
your
marriage
with
dread
.

how
much
of
her
life
have
be
make
up
of
her
companionship
with
you
;
 
and
all
the
good
of
it
too
!
<EOS>
You
ought
not
to
be
angry
with
her
for
regard
your
withdrawal
into
Cambridgeshire
with
dismay
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
could
not
act
the
lie
which
now
seem
to
be
incumbent
on
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
let
him
talk
of
Nethercoats
as
though
it
be
to
be
her
future
home

<EOS>
She
make
the
struggle
,

that
she
could
not

it

She
be
unable
to
find
the
word
which
should
tell
no
lie
to
the
ear
,

which
should
yet
deceive
him

not
congratulate
you
?
"
<EOS>
to
this
she
answer
nothing
,
but
beat
with
her
foot
upon
the
floor
as
though
she
be
impatient
of
his
word
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
Alice
,
I
understand
.
<EOS>
You
be
angry
with
me
,
"
he
continue
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
yet
you
have
no
right
to
be
surprised
that
when
you
tell
me
this
I
should
think
of
all
that
pass
between
us
in
Switzerland
.
<EOS>
surely
the
cousin
who
be
with
you
then
have
a
right
to
say
what
he
think
of
this
change
in
your
life
;
at
any
rate
he
may
do
so
,
if
as
in
this
case
he
approve
altogether
of
what
you
be
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
of
your
approval
,
George
;
but
pray
let
that
be
an
end
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
that
the
two
sit
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
.
<EOS>
She
be
wait
for
him
to
go
,
but
she
could
not
bid
him
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
be
angry
with
herself
,
in
that
she
have
allow
herself
to
tell
him
of
her
alter
plan
,
and
she
be
angry
with
him
because
he
would
not
understand
that
she
ought
to
be
spare
all
conversation
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
so
she
sit
look
through
the
window
at
the
row
of
gaslight
as
they
be
be
light

he
remain
in
his
chair
with
his
elbow
on
the
table

his
head
rest
on
his
hand

<EOS>
"
do
you
remember
ask
me
whether
I
ever
shiver
,
"
he
say
at
last
;
"
 
whether
I
ever
think
of
thing
that
make
me
shiver

do
not
you
remember
;
on
the
bridge
at
Basle

"
yes

I
remember

"
  
<EOS>

well

Alice

one
cause
for
my
shivering

over

I
will
not

more
than
that
now

Shall
you
remain
long
at
Cheltenham

<EOS>
"
just
a

then
you
come

I

yes

"
  
<EOS>
as
he
go
he
take
her
hand
and
press
it
closely
between
his
own
.
<EOS>
in
those
day
when
they
be
lover
,
 
engaged
lover
,
a
close
,
long
-
continue
pressure
of
her
hand
have
be
his
most
eloquent
speech
of
love

<EOS>
He
have
not
be
give
to
many
kiss
,
 
not
even
to
many
word
of
love
.
<EOS>
but
he
would
take
her
hand
and
hold
it
,
even
as
he
look
away
from
her
,
and
she
remember
well
the
touch
of
his
palm
.
<EOS>
It
be
ever
cool
,
 
cool
,
and
with
a
surface
smooth
as
a
woman
's
,
 
a
small
hand
that
have
a
firm
grip
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
day
when
she
have
love
to
feel
that
her
own
be
within
it
,
when
she
trust
in
it
,
and
intend
that
it
should
be
her
staff
through
life
.
<EOS>
now
she
distrust
it
;
and
as
the
thought
of
the
old
day
come
upon
her
,
and
the
remembrance
of
that
touch
be
recall
,
she
draw
her
hand
away
rapidly
.
<EOS>
not
for
that
have
she
drive
from
her
as
honest
a
man
as
have
ever
wish
to
mate
with
a
woman
.
<EOS>
He
,
George
Vavasor
,
have
never
so
hold
her
hand
since
the
day
when
they
have
part
,
and
now
on
this
first
occasion
of
her
freedom
she
feel
it
again
.
<EOS>
what
do
he
think
of
her
?
<EOS>
do
he
suppose
that
she
could
transfer
her
love
in
that
way
,
as
a
flower
may
be
take
from
one
buttonhole
and
place
in
another
?
<EOS>
He
read
it
all
,
and
know
that
he
be
hurry
on
too
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
understand
well
,
"
he
say
in
a
whisper
,
"
what
your
present
feeling
be
;
but
I
do
not
think
you
will
be
really
angry
with
me
because
I
have
be
unable
to
repress
my
joy
at
what
I
can
not

regard
as
your
release

a
great
misfortune

<EOS>
then
he
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
My

"
<EOS>
she
say
,
seat
herself
on
the
chair
from
which
he
have
rise
.
<EOS>
"
My
release
from

misfortune
!
<EOS>
no

my
fall
from

oh

what
a

that

that
I

drive
him
away
from

"
<EOS>
Her
thought
travel
off
to
the
sweetness
of
that
home
at
Nethercoats
,
to
the
excellence
of
that
master
who
may
have
be
hers
;
and
then
in
an
agony
of
despair
she
tell
herself
that
she
have
be
an
idiot
and
a
fool
,
as
well
as
a
traitor
.
<EOS>
what
have
she
want
in
life
that
she
should
have
thus
quarrel
with
as
happy
a
lot
as
ever
have
be
offer
to
a
woman
?
<EOS>
have
she
not
be
mad
,
when
she
send
from
her
side
the
only
man
that
she
love
,
 
the
only
man
that
she
have
ever
truly
respect
?
<EOS>
for
hour
she
sit
there
,
all
alone
,
put
out
the
candle
which
the
servant
have
light
for
her
,
and
leave
untasted
the
tea
that
be
bring
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
poor
Alice
!
<EOS>
I
hope
that
she
may
be
forgive
.
<EOS>
It
be
her
special
fault
,
that
when
at
Rome
she
long
for
Tibur
,
and
when
at
Tibur
she
regret
Rome
.
<EOS>
not
that
her
cousin
George
be
to
be
take
as
represent
the
joy
of
the
great
capital
,
though
Mr.
Grey
may
be
presume
to
form
no
inconsiderable
part
of
the
promised
delight
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
now
that
she
have
sacrifice
her
Tibur
,
because
it
have
seem
to
her
that
the
sunny
quiet
of
its
pasture
lack
the
excitement
necessary
for
the
happiness
of
life
,
she
be
again
prepare
to
quarrel
with
the
heartlessness
of
Rome
,
and
already
be
again
sigh
for
the
tranquillity
of
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
sit
there
,
full
of
these
regret
,
she
declare
to
herself
that
she
would
wait
for
her
father
's
return
,
and
then
,
throw
herself
upon
his
love
and
upon
his
mercy
,
would
beg
him
to
go
to
Mr.
Grey
and
ask
for
pardon
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
very
humble
to
him
,
"
she
say
;
"
but
he
be
so
good
,
that
I
may
dare
to
be
humble
before
him
.
"
<EOS>
so
she
wait
for
her
father
.
<EOS>
She
wait
till
twelve
,
till
one
,
till
two
;
 
but
still
he
do
not
come
.
<EOS>
later
than
that
she
do
not
dare
to
wait
for
him
.
<EOS>
She
fear
to
trust
him
on
such
business
return
so
late
as
that
,
 
after
so
many
cigar
;
after
,
perhaps
,
some
superfluous
beaker
of
club
nectar
.
<EOS>
His
temper
at
such
a
moment
would
not
be
fit
for
such
work
as
hers
.
<EOS>
but
if
he
be
late
in
come
home
,
who
have
send
him
away
from
his
home
in
unhappiness
?
<EOS>
between
two
and
three
<EOS>
she
go
to
bed
,
and
on
the
follow
morning
she
leave
Queen
Anne
Street
for
the
Great
Western
Station
before
her
father
be
up
.
   
<EOS>
Paramount
Crescent
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
live
at
no
.
3
,
Paramount
Crescent
,
in
Cheltenham
,
where
she
occupy
a
very
handsome
first
-
floor
drawing
-
room
,
with
a
bedroom
behind
it
,
look
over
a
stable
-
yard
,
and
a
small
room
which
would
have
be
the
dressing
-
room
have
the
late
Sir
Archibald
be
alive
,
but
which
be
at
present
call
the
dining
-
room
:
and
in
it
Lady
Macleod
do
dine
whenever
her
large
room
be
to
be
use
for
any
purpose
of
evening
company
.
<EOS>
the
vicinity
of
the
stable
-
yard
be
not
regard
by
the
tenant
as
among
the
attraction
of
the
house
;
but
it
have
the
effect
of
lower
the
rent
,
and
Lady
Macleod
be
a
woman
who
regard
such
matter
.
<EOS>
Her
income
,
though
small
,
would
have
suffice
to
enable
her
to
live
remove
from
such
discomfort
;
but
she
be
one
of
those
woman
who
regard
it
as
a
duty
to
leave
something
behind
them
,
 
even
though
it
be
leave
to
those
who
do
not
at
all
want
it
;
and
Lady
Macleod
be
a
woman
who
wilfully
neglect
no
duty
.
<EOS>
so
she
pinch
herself
,
and
inhale
the
effluvia
of
the
stable
,
and
squabble
with
the
cabman
,
in
order
that
she
may
bequeath
a
thousand
pound
or
two
to
some
Lady
Midlothian
,
who
care
,
perhaps
,
little
for
her
,
and
would
hardly
thank
her
memory
for
the
money
.
  
<EOS>
have
Alice
consent
to
live
with
her
,
she
would
have
merge
that
duty
of
leave
money
behind
her
in
that
other
duty
of
find
a
home
for
her
adopt
niece
.
<EOS>
but
Alice
have
go
away
,
and
therefore
the
money
be
due
to
Lady
Midlothian
rather
than
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
saving
,
however
,
be
postpone
whenever
Alice
would
consent
to
visit
Cheltenham
;
and
a
bedroom
be
secure
for
her
which
do
not
look
out
over
the
stable
.
<EOS>
accommodation
be
also
find
for
her
maid
much
better
than
that
provide
for
Lady
Macleod
's
own
maid
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
hospitable
,
good
old
woman
,
painfully
struggle
to
do
the
good
she
could
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
that
she
be
such
a
bore
,
a
pity
that
she
be
so
hard
to
cabman
and
other
,
a
pity
that
she
suspect
all
tradesman
,
servant
,
and
people
generally
of
a
rank
of
life
inferior
to
her
own
,
a
pity
that
she
be
dispose
to
condemn
for
ever
and
ever
so
many
of
her
own
rank
because
they
play
card
on
week
day
,
and
do
not
go
to
church
on
Sundays
,
 
and
a
pity
,
as
I
think
above
all
,
that
while
she
be
so
suspicious
of
the
poor
she
be
so
lenient
to
the
vice
of
earls
,
earl
's
son
,
and
such
like
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
,
have
fully
consider
the
matter
,
have
think
it
most
prudent
to
tell
Lady
Macleod
by
letter
what
she
have
do
in
regard
to
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
many
objection
to
the
writing
of
such
a
letter
,
but
there
appear
to
be
strong
objection
to
that
tell
it
face
to
face
which
would
have
be
force
upon
her
<EOS>
have
she
not
write
.
<EOS>
there
would
in
such
case
have
arise
on
Lady
Macleod
's
countenance
a
sternness
of
rebuke
which
Alice
do
not
choose
to
encounter
.
<EOS>
the
same
sternness
of
rebuke
would
come
upon
the
countenance
on
receipt
of
the
write
information
;
but
it
would
come
in
its
most
aggravated
form
on
the
immediate
receipt
of
the
letter
,
and
some
of
its
bitterness
would
have
pass
away
before
Alice
's
arrival
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
Alice
be
right
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
for
both
party
that
any
great
offence
should
be
confess
by
letter
.
  
<EOS>
but
Alice
tremble
as
the
cab
draw
up
at
no
.
3
,
Paramount
Crescent
.
<EOS>
She
meet
her
aunt
,
as
be
usual
,
just
inside
the
drawing
-
room
door
,
and
she
see
at
once
that
if
any
bitterness
have
pass
away
from
that
face
,
the
original
bitterness
must
indeed
have
be
bitter
.
<EOS>
She
have
so
time
her
letter
that
Lady
Macleod
should
have
no
opportunity
of
answer
it
.
<EOS>
the
answer
be
write
there
in
the
mingled
anger
and
sorrow
of
those
austere
feature
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
as
she
take
her
niece
in
her
arm
and
kiss
her
;
"
oh
,
Alice
,
what
be
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
aunt
;
it
be
very
bad
,
I
know
,
"
and
poor
Alice
try
to
make
a
jest
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
young
lady
be
very
wicked
when
they
do
not
know
their
own
mind
.
<EOS>
but
if
they
have
not
know
them
and
have
be
wicke
,
what
can
they
do
but
repent
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Repent
!
"
say
Lady
Macleod
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
;
I
hope
you
will
repent
.
<EOS>
poor
Mr.
Grey
;
 
<EOS>
what
must
he
think
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
hope
,
aunt
,
that
he
will
not
think
of
it
at
all
for
very
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
nonsense
,
my
dear
,
of
course
he
will
think
of
it
,
and
of
course
you
will
marry
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
,
aunt
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
will
.
<EOS>
why
,
Alice
,
have
not
it
be
all
settle
among
family
?
<EOS>
Lady
Midlothian
know
all
the
particular
of
it
just
as
well
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
and
be
not
your
word
pledge
to
him
?
<EOS>
I
really
do
not
understand
what
you
mean
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
how
it
be
possible
you
should
go
back
.
<EOS>
gentleman
when
they
do
that
kind
of
thing
be
put
out
of
society
;
 
but
I
really
think
it
be
bad
in
a
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
they
may
if
they
please
put
me
out
of
society
;
 
only
that
I
do
not
know
that
I
be
particularly
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
the
wickedness
of
the
thing
,
Alice
!
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
when
you
talk
to
me
about
society

aunt
,
and
about
Lady
Midlothian

I
give
up
to
you
,
willingly
;
 
the
more
willingly
,
perhaps
,
because
I
do
not
care
much
for
one
or
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
here
Lady
Macleod
try
to
say
a
word
;
but
she
fail
,
and
Alice
go
on
,
boldly
look
up
into
her
aunt
's
face
,
which
become
a
shade
more
bitter
than
ever
.
"
<EOS>
but
when
you
tell
me
about
wickedness
and
my
conscience
,
then
I
must
be
my
own
judge
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
conscience
,
and
the
fear
of
commit
wickedness
,
that
have
make
me
do
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
submit
to
be
guide
by
your
elder
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
my
elder
in
such
a
matter
as
this
can
not
teach
me
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
right
that
I
should
go
to
a
man
's
house
and
be
his
wife
,
if
I
do
not
think
that
I
can
make
him
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
why
do
you
accept
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
I
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
go
to
defend
that
.
<EOS>
if
you
choose
to
scold
me
for
that
,
you
may
do
so
,
aunt
,
and
I
will
not
answer
you
.
<EOS>
but
as
to
marry
him
or
not
marry
him
now
,
 
as
to
that
,
I
must
judge
for
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pity
<EOS>
you
do
not
know
your
own
mind
earlier
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pity
,
 
a
great
pity
.
<EOS>
I
have
do
myself
an
injury
that
be
quite
irretrievable
;
 
I
know
that
,
and
be
prepared
to
bear
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
do
him
,
too
,
an
injustice
which
I
regret
with
my
whole
heart
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
excuse
myself
by
say
that
I
may
have
do
him
a
bad
injustice
.
"
  
<EOS>
all
this
be
say
at
the
very
moment
of
her
arrival
,
and
the
greeting
do
not
seem
to
promise
much
for
the
happiness
of
the
next
month
;
but
perhaps
it
be
well
for
them
both
that
the
attack
and
the
defence
should
thus
be
make
suddenly
,
at
their
first
meeting
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
to
pull
the
string
at
once
when
you
be
in
the
shower
-
bath
,
and
not
to
stand
shivering
,
think
of
the
inevitable
shock
which
you
can
only
postpone
for
a
few
minute
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
in
this
case
have
pull
the
string
,
and
thus
reap
the
advantage
of
her
alacrity
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
,
"
say
her
ladyship
,
"
I
suppose
you
will
like
to
go
up
-
stair
and
take
off
your
bonnet
.
<EOS>
Mary
shall
bring
you
some
tea
when
you
come
down
.
"
<EOS>
so
Alice
escape
,
and
when
she
return
to
the
comfort
of
her
cup
of
tea
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
the
fury
of
the
storm
have
pass
away
.
<EOS>
She
sit
talk
of
other
thing
till
dinner
;
and
though
Lady
Macleod
do
during
the
evening
make
one
allusion
to
"
poor
Mr.
Grey
,
"
the
subject
be
allow
to
drop
.
<EOS>
Alice
be
very
tender
as
to
her
aunt
's
ailment
,
be
more
than
ordinarily
attentive
to
the
long
list
of
Cheltenham
iniquitie
which
be
display
to
her
,
and
refrain
from
combat
any
of
her
aunt
's
religious
view
.
<EOS>
after
a
while
they
get
upon
the
subject
of
Aunt
Greenow
,
for
whose
name
Lady
Macleod
have
a
special
aversion
,
 
as
indeed
<EOS>
she
have
for
all
the
Vavasor
side
of
Alice
's
family
;
and
then
Alice
offer
to
read
,
and
do
read
to
her
aunt
many
page
out
of
one
of
those
terrible
book
of
wrath
,
which
from
time
to
time
come
forth
and
tell
us
that
there
be
no
hope
for
us
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
like
to
be
so
tell
;
and
as
she
now
,
poor
woman
,
could
not
read
at
night
herself
,
she
enjoy
her
evening
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
no
doubt
do
enjoy
her
niece
's
sojourn
at
Cheltenham
,
but
I
do
not
think
it
could
have
be
pleasant
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
on
the
second
day
nothing
be
say
about
Mr.
Grey
,
and
Alice
hope
that
by
her
continual
reading
in
the
book
of
wrath
<EOS>
her
aunt
's
heart
may
be
soften
towards
her
.
<EOS>
but
it
seem
that
Lady
Macleod
measure
the
period
of
respite
,
for
on
the
third
day
and
on
the
fifth
she
return
to
the
attack
.
"
<EOS>
do
John
Grey
still
wish
that
the
match
should
go
on
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
,
categorically
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
that
Alice
try
to
put
aside
the
question
,
and
beg
that
the
matter
may
not
be
discuss
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
insist
on
her
right
to
carry
on
the
examination
,
and
Alice
be
drive
to
acknowledge
that
she
believe
he
do
wish
it
.
<EOS>
She
could
hardly
say
otherwise
,
see
that
she
have
at
that
moment
a
letter
from
him
in
her
pocket
,
in
which
he
still
speak
of
his
engagement
as
be
absolutely
bind
on
him
,
and
express
a
hope
that
this
change
from
London
to
Cheltenham
would
bring
her
round
and
set
everything
to
right
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
do
,
in
a
fashion
,
wave
his
hand
over
her
,
as
Kate
have
say
of
him
.
<EOS>
this
letter
Alice
have
resolve
that
she
would
not
answer
.
<EOS>
He
would
probably
write
again
,
and
she
would
beg
him
to
desist
.
<EOS>
instead
of
Cheltenham
bring
her
round
,
Cheltenham
have
make
her
firm
than
ever
in
her
resolution
.
<EOS>
I
be
inclined
to
think
that
the
good
mode
of
bring
her
round
at
this
moment
would
have
be
a
course
of
visit
from
her
cousin
George
,
and
a
series
of
letter
from
her
cousin
Kate
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
's
injunction
would
certainly
not
bring
her
round
.
  
<EOS>
after
ten
day
,
ten
terrible
day
,
devote
to
discussion
on
matrimony
in
the
morning
,
and
to
the
book
of
wrath
in
the
evening
,
 
relieve
by
two
tea
-
party
,
in
which
the
sin
of
Cheltenham
be
discuss
at
length
,
 
Lady
Macleod
herself
get
a
letter
from
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
's
kind
compliment
to
Lady
Macleod
.
<EOS>
He
believe
that
Lady
Macleod
be
aware
of
the
circumstance
of
his
engagement
with
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
may
he
call
on
Miss
Vavasor
at
Lady
Macleod
's
house
in
Cheltenham
?
<EOS>
and
may
he
also
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
make
Lady
Macleod
's
acquaintance
?
<EOS>
Alice
have
be
in
the
room
when
her
aunt
receive
this
letter
,
but
her
aunt
have
say
nothing
,
and
Alice
have
not
know
from
whom
the
letter
have
come
.
<EOS>
when
her
aunt
creep
away
with
it
after
breakfast
she
have
suspect
nothing
,
and
have
never
imagine
that
Lady
Macleod
,
in
the
privacy
of
her
own
room
look
out
upon
the
stable
,
have
address
a
letter
to
Nethercoats
.
<EOS>
but
such
a
letter
have
be
address
to
Nethercoats
,
and
Mr.
Grey
have
be
inform
that
he
would
be
receive
in
Paramount
Crescent
with
great
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
have
even
indicate
the
day
on
which
he
would
come
,
and
on
the
morning
of
that
day
Lady
Macleod
have
preside
over
the
two
teacup
in
a
state
of
nervous
excitement
which
be
quite
visible
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
more
than
once
Alice
ask
little
question
,
not
suppose
that
she
be
specially
concerned
in
the
matter
which
have
cause
her
aunt
's
fidgety
restlessness
,
but
observe
it
so
plainly
that
it
be
almost
impossible
not
to
allude
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
the
matter
,
my
dear
,
at
all
,
"
at
last
Lady
Macleod
say
;
but
as
she
say
so
she
be
make
up
her
mind
that
the
moment
have
not
come
in
which
she
must
apprise
Alice
of
Mr.
Grey
's
intend
visit
.
<EOS>
as
Alice
have
question
her
at
the
breakfast
table
she
would
say
nothing
about
it
then
,
but
wait
till
the
teacup
be
withdraw
,
and
till
the
maid
have
give
her
last
officious
poke
to
the
fire
.
<EOS>
then
she
begin
.
<EOS>
She
have
Mr.
Grey
's
letter
in
her
pocket
,
and
as
she
prepare
herself
to
speak
,
she
pull
it
out
and
hold
it
on
the
little
table
before
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
<EOS>
,
"
she
say
,
"
I
expect
a
visitor
here
to
-
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
know
instantly
who
be
the
expected
visitor
.
<EOS>
probably
any
girl
under
such
circumstance
would
have
know
equally
well
.
"
<EOS>
a
visitor
,
aunt
,
"
she
say
,
and
manage
to
hide
her
knowledge
admirably
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Alice
a
visitor
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
tell
you
before
,
only
I
think
,
 
I
think
I
have
well
not
.
<EOS>
It
be
Mr.
 
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
aunt
!
<EOS>
be
he
come
to
see
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
;
 
he
be
desirous
no
doubt
of
see
you
more
especially
;
but
he
have
express
a
wish
to
make
my
acquaintance
,
which
I
can
not
,
under
the
circumstance
,
think
be
unnatural
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
Alice
,
he
must
want
to
talk
over
this
affair
with
your
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
have
spare
them
,
"
say
Alice
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
bring
his
letter
here
,
and
you
can
see
it
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
nicely
write
,
and
as
far
as
I
be
concerned
I
should
not
think
of
refuse
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
and
now
come
the
question
.
<EOS>
what
be
we
to
do
with
him
?
<EOS>
be
I
to
ask
him
to
dinner
?
<EOS>
I
take
it
for
grant
that
he
will
not
expect
me
to
offer
him
a
bed
,
as
he
know
that
I
live
in
lodging
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
no
,
aunt
;
he
certainly
will
not
expect
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
ought
I
to
ask
him
to
dinner
?
<EOS>
I
should
be
most
happy
to
entertain
him
,
though
you
know
how
very
scanty
<EOS>
my
mean
of
do
so
be
;
 
but
<EOS>
I
really
do
not
know
how
it
may
be
,
 
between
you
and
him
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
We
should
not
fight
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
suppose
not
;
 
but
if
you
can
not
be
affectionate
in
your
manner
to
him
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
will
not
answer
for
my
manner
,
aunt
;
but
you
may
be
sure
of
this
,
 
that
I
should
be
affectionate
in
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
shall
always
regard
him
as
a
dearly
love
friend
;
though
for
many
year
,
no
doubt
,
I
shall
be
unable
to
express
my
friendship
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
may
be
all
very
well
,
Alice
,
but
it
will
not
be
what
he
will
want
.
<EOS>
I
think
upon
the
whole
that
I
have
well
not
ask
him
to
dinner
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
not
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
period
of
the
day
in
which
any
special
constraint
among
people
be
more
disagreeable
than
at
any
other
time
,
and
then
at
dinner
the
servant
must
see
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
may
be
some
awkwardness
if
he
be
to
dine
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
think
there
would
,
"
say
Alice
,
anxious
to
have
the
subject
drop
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
will
not
think
that
I
be
inhospitable
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
so
happy
to
do
the
good
I
could
for
him
,
for
I
regard
him
,
Alice
,
quite
as
though
he
be
to
be
your
husband
.
<EOS>
and
when
anybody
at
all
connect
with
me
have
come
to
Cheltenham
<EOS>
I
always
have
ask
them
to
dine
,
and
then
I
have
Gubbins
's
man
to
come
and
wait
at
table
,
 
as
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
of
all
man
in
the
world
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
be
the
last
to
think
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
should
only
make
me
the
more
careful
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
it
would
perhaps
be
more
comfortable
if
he
be
to
come
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
much
more
comfortable
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
will
be
here
in
the
afternoon
,
before
dinner
,
and
we
have
better
wait
at
home
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
will
want
to
see
you
alone
,
and
therefore
I
will
retire
to
my
own
room
,
"
 
look
over
the
stable
!
<EOS>
dear
old
lady
.
<EOS>
"
but
if
you
wish
it
,
I
will
receive
him
first
 
<EOS>
and
then
Martha
,
"
 
<EOS>
Martha
be
Alice
's
maid
 
"
can
fetch
you
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
discussion
as
to
the
propriety
or
impropriety
of
give
her
lover
a
dinner
have
not
be
pleasant
to
Alice
,
but
,
nevertheless
,
when
it
be
over
she
feel
grateful
to
Lady
Macleod
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
attempt
in
the
arrangement
to
make
Mr.
Grey
's
visit
as
little
painful
as
possible
;
and
though
such
a
discussion
at
such
a
time
may
as
well
have
be
avoid
,
the
decision
to
which
her
ladyship
have
at
last
come
with
reference
both
to
the
dinner
and
the
management
of
the
visit
<EOS>
be
,
no
doubt
,
the
right
one
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
have
be
quite
correct
in
all
her
anticipation
.
<EOS>
at
three
o'clock
Mr.
Grey
be
announce
,
and
Lady
Macleod
,
alone
,
receive
him
in
her
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
have
intend
to
give
him
a
great
deal
of
good
advice
,
to
bid
him
still
keep
up
his
heart
and
as
it
be
hold
up
his
head
,
to
confess
to
him
how
very
badly
Alice
be
behave
,
and
to
express
her
entire
concurrence
with
that
theory
of
bodily
ailment
as
the
cause
and
origin
of
her
conduct
.
<EOS>
but
she
find
that
Mr.
Grey
be
a
man
to
whom
she
could
not
give
much
advice
.
<EOS>
It
be
he
who
do
the
speaking
at
this
conference
,
and
not
she
.
<EOS>
She
be
overawe
by
him
after
the
first
three
minute
.
<EOS>
indeed
her
first
glance
at
him
have
awe
her
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
handsome
,
 
and
<EOS>
then
,
in
his
beauty
,
he
have
so
quiet
and
almost
sadden
an
air
!
<EOS>
strange
to
say
that
after
she
have
see
him
,
Lady
Macleod
entertain
for
him
an
infinitely
high
admiration
than
before
,
and
yet
she
be
less
surprised
than
she
have
be
at
Alice
's
refusal
of
him
.
<EOS>
the
conference
be
very
short
;
and
Mr.
Grey
have
not
be
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
the
house
before
Martha
attend
upon
her
mistress
with
her
summon
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
be
ready
and
come
down
instantly
.
<EOS>
She
find
Mr.
Grey
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
room
wait
to
receive
her
,
and
the
look
of
majesty
which
have
cow
Lady
Macleod
have
go
from
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
receive
her
with
a
kind
smile
,
have
she
come
to
him
with
a
promise
that
she
would
at
this
meeting
name
the
day
for
their
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
at
any
rate
it
do
not
make
him
unhappy

she
say
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
angry
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
I
should
have
follow
you
all
the

to
see
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
certainly
;
not
angry
,
Mr.
Grey

<EOS>
all
anger
that
there
may
be
between
us
must
be
on
your
side

<EOS>
I
feel
that
thoroughly

then
there
shall

you

Your

You

yes

I
be
in
London
the
day

<EOS>

It
be
so
terrible
to
think
that
I

bring
upon
you
all
this
trouble

You
will
bring
upon
me
much
bad
trouble
than
that

I
have
not
now
come
down
here
to
tell
you
that

<EOS>
I
believe
that
accord
to
rule
in
such
matter
I
should
not

come
to
you
at
all

I
do
not

I
care
much
about
such
rule

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
I
that
have
break
all
rule

when
a
lady
tell
a
gentleman
that

do
not

more

oh

Mr.

I

you

I
be
glad
at
any
rate

hear
you
deny
it

but
you
will
understand
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
when
a
gentleman
get
his
dismissal
from
a
lady
he
should
accept
it
,
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
his
dismissal
under
such
circumstance

I
have

mine

I
can
not
lay
down
my
love
in
that
way

maintain
my
love

can
I
give
up
the
battle

<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
that
I
have
a
right
at
any
rate
to
know
something
of
your
coming

going
as
long

Alice

you

another

<EOS>

My
intention
be

keep
my

"
<EOS>
this
she
say
in
the
low
possible

almost
in

whisper

fix

injure

I
even
so
little
selfish
as
you
be

I
think

look

Her

confess

well

we
can

differ
,
Alice

<EOS>
in
that
we
do
differ

<EOS>
and
now
I
will
say
one
word
to
explain
why
I
have
come
here

<EOS>
if
I
be
to
write
to
you
against
your

it

seem

I
be
persecute
you

<EOS>
I
can
not
bring
myself
to
do
that
,
even
though
I
have
the
right
.
<EOS>
but
if
I
be
to
let
you
go
from
me
,
take
what
you
have
say
to
me

do
nothing
,
it

I

I

I
will
not

I
come
simply
to
tell
you
that
I
be
still
your
suitor

<EOS>
if
you
will
let
me
,
I
will
see
you
again
early
in
January

soon
as
you
have
return
to
town

You
will
hardly
refuse
to
see
me

no

;
"
I
can
not

see
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
it
shall
be
so
,
"
he
say
,
"
and
I
will
not
trouble
you
with
letter

will
I
trouble
you
longer
now
with
word

tell
your
aunt

I
have
say
what
I
come
to
say

that
I
give
her
my
kind
thank

"
<EOS>
then
he
take
her
hand
and
press
it
,
 
not
as
George
Vavasor
have
press
it
,
 
and
be
go
.
<EOS>
when
Lady
Macleod
return
,
she
find
that
the
question
of
the
evening
's
tea
arrangement
have
settle
itself
.
   
<EOS>
the
Roebury
Club
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
say
that
George
Vavasor
have
a
little
establishment
at
Roebury
,
down
in
Oxfordshire
,
and
thither
he
betake
himself
about
the
middle
of
November
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
long
know
in
this
county
,
and
whether
or
no
man
speak
well
of
him
as
a
man
of
business
in
London
,
man
speak
well
of
him
down
there
,
as
one
who
know
how
to
ride
to
hound
.
<EOS>
not
that
Vavasor
be
popular
among
fellow
-
sportsman
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
otherwise
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
man
that
make
himself
really
popular
in
any
social
meeting
of
man
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
himself
care
for
the
loose
little
talking
,
half
flat
and
half
sharp
,
of
man
when
they
meet
together
in
idleness
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
open
enough
in
his
nature
for
such
popularity
.
<EOS>
some
man
be
afraid
of
him
,
and
some
suspect
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
other
who
make
up
to
him
,
seek
his
intimacy
,
but
these
he
usually
snub
,
and
always
keep
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
though
he
have
indulge
in
all
the
ordinary
pleasure
of
young
man
,
he
have
never
be
a
jovial
man
.
<EOS>
in
his
conversation
with
man
he
always
seem
to
think
that
he
should
use
his
time
towards
serve
some
purpose
of
business
.
<EOS>
with
woman
he
be
quite
the
reverse
.
<EOS>
with
woman
he
could
be
happy
.
<EOS>
with
woman
he
could
really
associate
.
<EOS>
a
woman
he
could
really
love
;
 
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
whether
for
all
that
he
could
treat
a
woman
well
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
be
know
in
the
Oxfordshire
country
as
a
man
who
know
what
he
be
about
,
and
such
man
be
always
welcome
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
man
who
do
not
know
how
to
ride
that
be
make
uncomfortable
in
the
hunting
field
by
cold
look
or
express
censure
.
<EOS>
and
yet
it
be
very
rarely
that
such
man
do
any
real
harm
.
<EOS>
such
a
one
may
now
and
then
get
among
the
hound
or
override
the
hunt
,
but
it
be
not
often
so
.
<EOS>
many
such
complaint
be
make
;
but
in
truth
the
too
forward
man
,
who
press
the
dog
,
be
generally
one
who
can
ride
,
but
be
too
eager
or
too
selfish
to
keep
in
his
proper
place
.
<EOS>
the
bad
rider
,
like
the
bad
whist
player
,
pay
highly
for
what
he
do
not
enjoy
,
and
should
be
thank
.
<EOS>
but
at
both
game
he
get
cruelly
snub
.
<EOS>
at
both
game
George
Vavasor
be
great
and
he
never
get
snub
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
man
who
live
together
at
Roebury
in
a
kind
of
club
,
 
four
or
five
of
them
,
who
come
thither
from
London
,
run
backwards
and
forwards
as
hunting
arrangement
enable
them
to
do
so
,
 
a
brewer
or
two
and
a
banker
,
with
a
would
-
be
fast
attorney
,
a
sport
literary
gentleman
,
and
a
young
unmarried
Member
of
Parliament
who
have
no
particular
home
of
his
own
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
these
man
form
the
Roebury
Club
,
and
a
jolly
life
they
have
of
it
.
<EOS>
They
have
their
own
wine
closet
at
the
King
's
Head
,
 
or
Roebury
Inn
as
the
house
have
come
to
be
popularly
call
,
 
and
supply
their
own
game
.
<EOS>
the
landlord
find
everything
else
;
and
as
they
be
not
very
particular
about
their
bill
,
they
be
allow
to
do
pretty
much
as
they
like
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
They
be
rather
imperious
,
very
late
in
their
hour
,
sometimes
,
though
not
often
,
noisy
,
and
once
there
have
be
a
hasty
quarrel
which
have
make
the
landlord
in
his
anger
<EOS>
say
that
the
club
should
be
turn
out
of
his
house
.
<EOS>
but
they
pay
well
,
chaff
the
servant
much
oftener
than
they
bully
them
,
and
on
the
whole
be
very
popular
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
club
Vavasor
do
not
belong
,
allege
that
he
could
not
afford
to
live
at
their
pace
,
and
alleging
,
also
,
that
his
stay
at
Roebury
be
not
long
enough
to
make
him
a
desirable
member
.
<EOS>
the
invitation
to
him
be
not
repeat
and
he
lodge
elsewhere
in
the
little
town
.
<EOS>
but
he
occasionally
go
in
of
an
evening
,
and
would
make
up
with
the
member
a
table
at
whist
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
come
down
to
Roebury
by
mail
train
,
ready
for
hunt
the
next
morning
,
and
walk
into
the
club
-
room
just
at
midnight
.
<EOS>
there
he
find
Maxwell
the
banker
,
Grindley
the
would
-
be
fast
attorney
,
and
Calder
Jones
the
Member
of
Parliament
,
play
dummy
.
<EOS>
neither
of
the
brewer
be
there
,
nor
be
the
sport
literary
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
be
Vavasor
,
"
say
Maxwell
,
"
and
now
we
will
not
play
this
blackguard
game
any
longer
.
<EOS>
somebody
tell
me
,
Vavasor
,
that
you
be
go
away
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
go
away
;
 
what
,
like
a
fox
?

<EOS>

I
do
not
know
what
it
be
;
that
something
have
happen
to
you
since
last
season

that
you
be
married
,
or
dead
,
or
go
abroad

<EOS>
by
George

I
have
lose
the
trick
after
all

<EOS>
I
hate
dummy
like
the

I
never
hold
a
card
in
dummy

<EOS>
yes
,
I
know
;
that
be
seven
point
on
each
side

<EOS>
Vavasor
,
come
and
cut
.
<EOS>
upon
my
word
if
any
one
have
ask
me
,
I
should
have
say
you
be
dead

you
see
,
nobody
ever

think
of
ask
you
anything

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
you
probably
mean
,
"
say
Grindley
,
"
be
that
Vavasor

Chelsea

February
;
but
you
have

Calder

I

have
a
rubber
.

"
  
<EOS>
They
play
till
three
and
Mr.
Calder
Jones
lose
a
good
deal
of
money
,
 
a
good
deal
of
money
in
a
little
way
,
for
they
never
play
above
ten

shill
point
,
and
no
bet
be
make
for
more
than
a
pound
or
two
.
<EOS>
but
Vavasor
be
the
winner
,
and
when
he
leave
the
room
he
become
the
subject
of
some
ill
-
natured
remark
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
he
like
come
in
here
,
"
say
Grindley
,
who
have
himself
be
the
man
to
invite
him
to
belong
to
the
club
,
and
who
have
at
one
time
indulge
the
ambition
of
an
intimacy
with
George
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
understand
it
,
"
say
Calder
Jones
,
who
be
a
little
bitter
about
his
money
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
last
year
he
seem
to
walk
in
just
when
he
like

as
though
he

He
be
a
bad

Grindley
;

he
be
so
uncommonly
dark

<EOS>
I
do
not
know
where
on

he
get
his
money
from

He
be
heir
to
some
small
property
in

he
lose

He

Grindley

perhaps
not

Grindems

he
can
not

We
have
ask

often

not

I
do

"
<EOS>
a
bystander
may
have
think
from
the
tone
of
Mr.
Maxwell
's
voice
that
he
be
allude
to
Mr.

himself
,
but
Mr.
Grindley
do
not

take
it
in

light
.

that

true

of
course
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
We
can
not

we
please

I
certainly
do

out

the
club
breakfast
the

morning
at
nine
o'clock

in
order
that
they
may
start
at
half

past
for
the
meet
at
Edgehill
.
<EOS>
Edgehill
be
twelve
mile
from
Roebury
,
and
the
hack
would
do
it
in
an
hour
and
a
half
,
 
or
perhaps
a
little
less
.
"
<EOS>
do
anybody
know
anything
about
that
brown
horse
of
Vavasor
's
?
"
say
Maxwell
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
him
come
into
the
yard
yesterday
with
that
old
groom
of
his
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
a
brown
horse
last
season
,
"
say
Grindley
;
 
"
a
little
thing
that
go
very
fast
,
but
be
not
quite
sound
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
mare
,
"

Maxwell
,

he
sell
her
to
Cinquebars
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
*
  
"
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
,
"
say
Calder
Jones
,
"
and
she
be
not
worth
the
odd
fifty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
win
seventy
with
her
at
Leamington
,
"
say
Maxwell
,
"
and
I
doubt
whether
he
would
take
his
money
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
be
cinquebar
come
down
here
this
year
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
say
Maxwell
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
good
fellow
in
the
world
,
but
he
can
not
ride
,
and
he
do
not
care
for
hunting
,
and
he
make
more
row
than
any
fellow
I
ever
meet
.
<EOS>
I
wish
some
fellow
could
tell
me
something
about
that
fellow
's
brown
horse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
never
buy
a
horse
of
Vavasor
's
if
I
be
you
,
"
say
Grindley
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
never
have
anything
that
be
all
right
all
round
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
who
have
?
"
say
Maxwell
,
as
he
take
into
his
plate
a
second
mutton
chop
,
which
have
just
be
bring
up
hot
into
the
room
especially
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
mistake
man
make
about
horse
,
and
that
be
why
there
be
so
much
cheating
.
<EOS>
I
never
ask
for
a
warranty
with
a
horse
,
and
do
not
very
often
have
a
horse
examine
.
<EOS>
yet
I
do
as
well
as
other
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
have
perfect
horse
any
more
than
you
can
perfect
man
,
or
perfect
woman
.
<EOS>
You
put
up
with
red
hair
,
or
bad
tooth
,
or
big
foot
,
 
or
sometimes
with
the
devil
of
a
voice
.
<EOS>
but
a
man
when
he
want
a
horse
will
not
put
up
with
anything
!
<EOS>
therefore
those
who
have
get
horse
to
sell
must
lie
.
<EOS>
when
I
go
into
the
market
with
three
hundred
pound
I
expect
a
perfect
animal
.
<EOS>
as
I
never
do
that
now
I
never
expect
a
perfect
animal
.
<EOS>
I
like
"
em
to
see
;
I
like
"
<EOS>
em
to
have
four
leg
;
and
I
like
"
em
to
have
a
little
wind

<EOS>
I
do
not
much
mind
anything
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
by
Jove
you
be
about
right
,
"
say
Calder
Jones
.
<EOS>
the
reader
will
therefore
readily
see
that
Mr.
Maxwell
the
banker
reign
as
king
in
that
club
.
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
have
send
two
horse
on
in
charge
of
Bat
Smithers
,
and
follow
on
a
pony
about
fourteen
hand
high
,
which
he
have
ride
as
a
cover
hack
for
the
last
four
year
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
start
till
near
ten
,
but
he
be
able
to
catch
Bat
with
his
two
horse
about
a
mile
and
a
half
on
that
side
of
Edgehill
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
you
manage
to
come
along
pretty
clean
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
master
ask
as
he
come
up
with
his
servant
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
the
most
beastly
road
in
all
England
,
"
say
Bat
,
who
always
find
fault
with
any
county
in
which
he
happen
to
be
locate
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
will
warrant
I
be
clean
than
most
on
"
em
.
<EOS>
what
for
any
county
should
make
such
road
as
them
<EOS>
I
never
could
tell
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
the
road
about
there
be
bad
,
certainly
;
 
very
bad
.
<EOS>
but
I
suppose
they
would
have
be
well
have
Providence
send
well
material
.
<EOS>
and
what
do
you
think
of
the
brown
horse
,
Bat
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
say
no
more
,
and
that
he
say
with
a
drawl
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
as
fine
an
animal
to
look
at
as
ever
<EOS>
I
put
my
eye
on
,
"
say
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
all
that
,
"
say
Bat
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
get
lot
of
pace
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
he
have
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
they
tell
me
you
can
not
beat
him
at
jump
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
They
can
mostly
do
that
,
sir
,
if
they
be
well
handle
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
he
be
a
deal
over
my
weight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
he
be
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
fourteen
stoner
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
or
fifteen
,
"
say
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
he
may
,
sir
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
know
what
a
"
orse
can
carry
till
he
be
try
.
"
  
<EOS>
George
ask
his
groom
no
more
question
,
but
feel
sure
that
he
have
better
sell
his
brown
horse
if
he
could
.
<EOS>
now
I
here
protest
that
there
be
nothing
specially
amiss
with
the
brown
horse
.
<EOS>
towards
the
end
of
the
precede
season
he
have
overreach
himself
and
have
be
lame
,
and
have
be
sell
by
some
owner
with
more
money
than
brain
who
have
not
care
to
wait
for
a
cure
.
<EOS>
then
there
have
go
with
him
a
bad
character
,
and
a
vague
suspicion
have
attach
itself
to
him
,
as
there
do
to
hundred
of
horse
which
be
very
good
animal
in
their
way
.
<EOS>
He
have
come
thus
to
Tattersall
's
,
and
Vavasor
have
buy
him
cheap
,
think
that
he
may
make
money
of
him
,
from
his
form
and
action
.
<EOS>
He
have
find
nothing
amiss
with
him
,
 
nor
,
indeed
,
have
Bat
Smithers
.
<EOS>
but
his
character
go
with
him
,
and
therefore
Bat
Smithers
think
it
well
to
be
know
.
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
know
as
much
of
horse
as
most
man
can
,
 
as
,
perhaps
,
as
any
man
can
who
be
not
a
dealer
,
or
a
veterinary
surgeon
;
but
he
,
like
all
man
,
doubt
his
own
knowledge
,
though
on
that
subject
he
would
never
admit
that
he
doubt
it
.
<EOS>
therefore
he
take
Bat
's
word
and
feel
sure
that
the
horse
be
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
a
run
from
the
big
wood
,
"
say
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
they
make
un
break
,
you
will
,
sir
,
"
say
Bat
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
any
rate
I
will
ride
the
brown
horse
,
"
say
George
.
<EOS>
then
,
as
soon
as
that
be
settle
between
them
,
the
Roebury
Club
overtake
them
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
now
a
rush
of
horse
on
the
road
altogether
,
and
they
be
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
Edgehill
church
,
close
to
which
be
the
meet
.
<EOS>
bat
with
his
two
hunter
fall
a
little
behind
,
and
the
other
trot
on
together
.
<EOS>
the
other
groom
with
their
animal
be
on
in
advance
,
and
be
by
this
time
employ
in
comb
out
forelock
,
and
rub
stirrup
leather
and
horse
"
leg
free
from
the
dirt
of
the
road
;
 
but
Bat
Smithers
be
like
his
master
,
and
do
not
congregate
much
with
other
man
,
and
Vavasor
be
sure
to
give
order
to
his
servant
different
from
the
order
give
by
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
well
mount
this
year
?
"
<EOS>
Maxwell
ask
of
George
Vavasor

<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
;
I
never
be
what
I
call
well
mount
yet

<EOS>
I
generally
have
one
horse
and
three
or
four
cripple
.
<EOS>
that
brown
horse
behind
there
be
pretty
good
,
I
believe

<EOS>

I
see
your

have
get
the
old
chestnut
mare
with
him

She
be
one
of
the
cripple

not
but
what
she
be
as
sound
as
a
bell
,
and
as
good
a
hunter
as
ever
I
wish
to
ride
;
but
she
make
a
little
noise
when
she
be
go

"
so
that
you
can
hear
her
three
field
off
,

Grindley

five

the
field
be
small
enough

your
ear
be
sharp
enough

Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
all
the
same
I
would
not
change
her
for
the
good
horse
I
ever
see
under
you

<EOS>
"
have
you
there

Grindems

say
Maxwell

<EOS>

no

Grindley

<EOS>
"

not

me
at
all

<EOS>
"
Your
horse

Grindley
,
be
always
up
to
all
the
work
they
have
to
do
,
"
say
George
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
know
what
any
man
want
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
again
,
Grindems
,
"

Maxwell
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
ride
against
him
any
day
,

Grindley

<EOS>
"
yes
;

against
a
brick
wall
either

have
you
again

Whereupon
Mr.
Grindley
trot
on
,
round
the
corner
by
the
church
,
and
into
the
field
in
which
the
hound
be
assemble
.
<EOS>
the
fire
have
become
too
hot
for
him
,
and
he
think
it
best
to
escape
.
<EOS>
have
it
be
Vavasor
alone
<EOS>
he
would
have
turn
upon
him
and
snarl
,
but
he
could
not
afford
to
exhibit
any
ill
temper
to
the
king
of
the
club
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grindley
be
not
popular
,
and
be
Maxwell
to
turn
openly
against
him
his
sport
life
down
at
Roebury
would
decidedly
be
a
failure
.
  
<EOS>
the
life
of
such
man

Mr.

,
 
man
who
be
tolerate
in
the
daily
society

<EOS>
and
yet
how
many
such
man
do
one
see
in
almost
every
set
?
<EOS>
why
Mr.
Grindley
should
have
be
inferior
to
Mr.
Maxwell
the
banker
,
or
to
Stone
,
or
to
Prettyman
who
be
brewer
,
or
even
to
Mr.
Pollock
<EOS>
the
heavy
-
weight
literary
gentleman
,
I
can
hardly
say
.
<EOS>
an
attorney
by
his
trade
be
at
any
rate
as
good
as
a
brewer
,
and
there
be
many
attorney
who
hold
their
head
high
anywhere
.
<EOS>
Grindley
be
a
rich
man
,
 
or
at
any
rate
rich
enough
for
the
life
he
lead
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
much
about
his
birth
,
but
I
believe
it
be
as
good
as
Maxwell
's
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
ignorant
,
or
a
fool
;
 
whereas
I
rather
think
Maxwell
be
a
fool
.
<EOS>
Grindley
have
make
his
own
way
in
the
world
,
but
Maxwell
would
certainly
not
have
make
himself
a
banker
if
his
father
have
not
be
a
banker
before
him
;
nor
could
the
bank
have
go
on
and
prosper
<EOS>
have
there
not
be
partner
there
who
be
well
man
of
business
than
our
friend
.
<EOS>
Grindley
know
that
he
have
a
well
intellect
than
Maxwell
;
and
yet
he
allow
Maxwell
to
snub
him
,
and
he
toady
Maxwell
in
return
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
on
the
score
of
ride
that
Maxwell
claim
and
hold
his
superiority
,
for
Grindley
do
not
want
pluck
,
and
every
one
know
that
Maxwell
have
live
freely
and
that
his
nerve
be
not
what
they
have
be
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
have
come
from
the
outward
look
of
the
man
,
from
the
form
of
each
,
from
the
gait
and
visage
which
in
one
be
good
and
in
the
other
insignificant
.
<EOS>
the
nature
of
such
dominion
of
man
over
man
be
very
singular
,
but
this
be
certain
that
when
once
obtain
in
manhood
it
may
be
easily
hold
.
  
<EOS>
among
boy
at
school
the
same
thing
be
even
more
conspicuous
,
because
boy
have
less
of
conscience
than
man
,
be
more
addicted
to
tyranny
,
and
when
weak
be
less
prone
to
feel
the
misery
and
disgrace
of
succumb
.
<EOS>
who
have
be
through
a
large
school
and
do
not
remember
the
Maxwells
and
Grindleys
,
 
the
tyrant
and
the
slave
,
 
those
who
domineer
and
those
who
submit
?
<EOS>
nor
be
it
,
even
then
,
personal
strength
,
nor
always
superior
courage
,
that
give
the
power
of
command
.
<EOS>
nor
be
it
intellect
,
or
thoughtfulness
,
nor
by
any
mean
such
quality
as
make
man
and
boy
lovable
.
<EOS>
It
be
say
by
many
who
have
have
to
deal
with
boy
,
that
certain
among
them
claim
and
obtain
ascendancy
by
the
spirit
within
them
;
but
I
doubt
whether
the
ascendancy
be
not
rather
thrust
on
them
than
claim
by
them
.
<EOS>
here
again
I
think
the
outward
gait
of
the
boy
go
far
towards
obtain
for
him
the
submission
of
his
fellow
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
tyrant
boy
do
not
become
the
tyrant
man
,
or
the
slave
boy
the
slave
man
,
because
the
outward
visage
,
that
have
be
noble
or
mean
in
the
one
,
change
and
become
so
often
mean
or
noble
in
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"

George

be
Pollock

say
Maxwell
,
as
he

into
the
field

a

London

so

"
<EOS>
Mr.
Pollock
be
the
heavy
-
weight
sporting
literary
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
Edgehill
.
 
<EOS>
of
all
sight
in
the
world
there
be
,
I
think
,
none
more
beautiful
than
that
of
a
pack
of
fox
-
hounds
seat
,
on
a
winter
morning
,
round
the
huntsman
,
if
the
place
of
meeting
have
be
choose
with
anything
of
artistic
skill
.
<EOS>
It
should
be
in
a
grassy
field
,
and
the
field
should
be
small
.
<EOS>
It
should
not
be
absolutely
away
from
all
building
,
and
the
hedgerow
should
not
have
be
clip
and
pare
,
and
make
straight
with
reference
to
modern
agricultural
economy
.
<EOS>
there
should
be
tree
near
,
and
the
ground
should
be
a
little
uneven
,
so
as
to
mark
some
certain
small
space
as
the
exact
spot
where
the
dog
and
servant
of
the
hunt
should
congregate
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
well
-
know
grand
meet
in
England
,
in
the
park
of
nobleman
,
before
their
house
,
or
even
on
what
be
call
their
lawn
;
but
these
magnificent
affair
have
but
little
of
the
beauty
of
which
I
speak
.
<EOS>
such
assembly
be
too
grand
and
too
ornate
,
and
,
moreover
,
much
too
far
remove
from
true
sporting
propriety
.
<EOS>
at
them
,
equipage
be
shine
,
and
lady
"
dress
be
gorgeous
,
and
crowd
of
tradesman
from
the
neighbouring
town
have
come
there
to
look
at
the
grand
folk
.
<EOS>
to
my
eye
there
be
nothing
beautiful
in
that
.
<EOS>
the
meet
I
speak
of
be
arrange
with
a
view
to
sport
,
but
the
accident
of
the
locality
may
make
it
the
pretty
thing
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
such
,
in
a
special
degree
,
be
the
case
at
Edgehill
.
<EOS>
at
Edgehill
the
whole
village
consist
of
three
or
four
cottage
;
but
there
be
a
small
old
church
,
with
an
old
grey
tower
,
and
a
narrow
,
green
,
almost
dark
,
churchyard
,
surround
by
elm
-
tree
.
<EOS>
the
road
from
Roebury
to
the
meet
pass
by
the
church
stile
,
and
turn
just
beyond
it
come
upon
the
gate
which
lead
into
the
little
field
in
which
the
hound
feel
themselves
as
much
at
home
as
in
their
kennel
.
<EOS>
there
may
be
six
or
seven
acre
in
the
field
,
which
be
long
and
narrow
,
so
that
the
huntsman
have
space
to
walk
leisurely
up
and
down
with
the
pack
cluster
round
him
,
when
he
consider
that
longer
sit
may
chill
them
.
<EOS>
the
church
tower
be
close
at
hand
,
visible
through
the
tree
,
and
the
field
itself
be
green
and
soft
,
though
never
splash
with
mud
or
heavy
with
hole
.
  
<EOS>
Edgehill
be
a
favourite
meet
in
that
country
,
partly
because
fox
be
very
abundant
in
the
great
wood
adjacent
,
partly
because
the
whole
country
around
be
grass
-
land
,
and
partly
,
no
doubt
,
from
the
sport
propensity
of
the
neighbouring
population
.
<EOS>
as
regard
my
own
taste
,
I
do
not
know
that
I
do
like
begin
a
day
with
a
great
wood
,
 
and
if
not
begin
it
,
certainly
not
end
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
hard
to
come
upon
the
cream
of
hunting
,
as
it
be
upon
the
cream
of
any
other
delight
.
<EOS>
who
can
always
drink
Lafitte
of
the
fine
,
can
always
talk
to
a
woman
who
be
both
beautiful
and
witty
,
or
can
always
find
the
right
spirit
in
the
poetry
he
read
?
<EOS>
a
man
have
usually
to
work
through
much
mud
before
he
get
his
nugget
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
certainly
in
hunting
,
and
a
big
wood
too
frequently
afflict
the
sportsman
,
as
the
mud
do
the
miner
.
<EOS>
the
small
gorse
cover
be
the
happy
,
much
-
envied
bit
of
ground
in
which
the
gold
be
sure
to
show
itself
readily
.
<EOS>
but
without
the
wood
the
gorse
would
not
hold
the
fox
,
and
without
the
mud
the
gold
would
not
have
find
its
resting
-
place
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
have
say
,
Edgehill
be
a
popular
meet
,
and
,
as
regard
the
meet
itself
,
be
eminently
picturesque
.
<EOS>
on
the
present
occasion
the
little
field
be
full
of
horseman
,
move
about
slowly
,
chat
together
,
smoke
cigar
,
get
off
from
their
hack
and
mount
their
hunter
,
give
order
to
their
servant
,
and
prepare
for
the
day
.
<EOS>
there
be
old
country
gentleman
there
,
greet
each
other
from
far
side
of
the
county
;
sport
farmer
who
love
to
find
themselves
alongside
their
landlord
,
and
to
feel
that
the
pleasure
of
the
country
be
common
to
both
;
man
down
from
town
,
like
our
friend
of
the
Roebury
club
,
who
make
hunt
their
choose
pleasure
,
and
who
form
,
in
number
,
perhaps
the
large
portion
of
the
field
;
officer
from
garrison
round
about
;
a
cloud
of
servant
,
and
a
few
nondescript
straggler
who
have
pick
up
horse
,
hither
and
thither
,
round
the
country
.
<EOS>
outside
the
gate
on
the
road
be
draw
up
a
variety
of
vehicle
,
open
carriage
,
dog
-
cart
,
gig
,
and
waggonette
,
in
some
few
of
which
be
seat
lady
who
have
come
over
to
see
the
meet
.
<EOS>
but
Edgehill
be
,
essentially
,
not
a
lady
'
meet
.
<EOS>
the
distance
to
it
be
long
,
and
the
ride
in
Cranby
Wood
 
<EOS>
the
big
wood
 
be
not
adapt
for
wheel
.
<EOS>
there
be
one
or
two
lady
on
horseback
,
as
be
always
the
case
;
but
Edgehill
be
not
a
place
popular
,
even
with
hunting
lady

<EOS>
one
carriage
,
that
of
the
old
master
of
the
hound
,
have
enter
the
sacred
precinct
of
the
field
,
and
from
this
the
old
baronet
be
just
descend
,
as
Maxwell
,
Calder
Jones
,
and
Vavasor
ride
into
the
field
.
  
<EOS>
"
I

you
well

Maxwell

greet
the

then
some

he

<EOS>
have
slowly
be
assist
up
on

he

he
trot
off
to
the
hound

while
all
the
farmer
round
him

their
hat
to
him

<EOS>
but
his
mind
be
laden
with
affair
of
import
,
and
he
notice
no
one

<EOS>
in
a
whispered
voice
he
give
his
instruction
to
his
huntsman
,
who
say
,
"
yes

"
"
no

say
Sir
William
aloud
to
some
one
near
him
,
as
the
huntsman
move
off
with
the
hound
.
<EOS>
Sir
William
know
the
man
well
enough
,
but
be
minded
to
punish
him
for
his
discourtesy

<EOS>
"
where
shall
we

Sir

Calder

in

be

"
<EOS>
how
the
mischief

say
Sir
William

with
an
oath

Calder
Jones
retire
unhappy
,

for
the
moment
altogether
silence

<EOS>
and
yet
Sir
William
be
the
most
popular
man
in
the
county
,
and
no
more
courteous
gentleman
ever
sit
at
the
bottom
of
his
own
table

<EOS>
a
mild
man
he
be
,
too
,
when
out
of
his
saddle
,
and
<EOS>
one
by
no
means
dispose
to
assume
special
supremacy

<EOS>
but
a
master
of
hound
,
if
he
have
long
hold
the
country
,
 
and
Sir
William
have
hold
his
for
more
than
thirty
year
,
 
obtain
a
power
which
that
of
no
other
potentate
can
equal
.
<EOS>
He
may
say
and
do
what
he
please
,
and
his
tyranny
be
always
respect

<EOS>
no
conspiracy
against
him
have
a
chance
of
success
;
no
sedition
will
meet
with
sympathy
;
 
that
is
,
if
he
be
successful
in
show
sport

<EOS>
if
a
man
be
swear
at
,
abuse
,
and
put
down
without
cause
,
let
him
bear
it
and
think
that
he
have
be
a
victim
for
the
public
good

<EOS>
and
let
him
never
be
angry
with
the
master
.
<EOS>
that
rough
tongue
be
the
necessity
of
the
master
's
position
.
<EOS>
They
use
to
say
that
no
captain
could
manage
a
ship
without
swear
at
his
man
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
the
captain
's
trouble
in
comparison
with
those
of
the
master
of
hound
?
<EOS>
the
captain
's
man
be
under
discipline
,
and
can
be
lock
up
,
flog
,
or
have
their
grog
stop
.
<EOS>
the
master
of
hound
can
not
stop
the
grog
of
any
offender
,
and
he
can
only
stop
the
tongue

sharp

two

It
be
nearly
twelve

then
for
an
hour
there
be
great
excitement
among

who
ride
up

hallooing

together
in
broad
spot

their

smoke
cigar

It

<EOS>
Grindley
be
again
go
to

but
be
on
this
time
save
by
the
appearance

huntsman

who
come
gallop
up
one
of

with
a
lot
of

He

off

<EOS>
Vavasor
change
his
horse
,
get
on
to
the
brown
one
,
and
give
up
his
chestnut
mare
to
Bat
Smithers
,
who
suggest
that
he
may
as
well
go
home
to
Roebury
now
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
give
him
no
answer
,
but
,
trot
on
to
the
point
where
the
ride
meet
,
stop
a
moment
and
listen
carefully
.
<EOS>
then
he
take
a
path
diverge
away
from
that
by
which
the
huntsman
and
the
crowd
of
horseman
have
go
,
and
make
the
good
of
his
way
through
the
wood
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
this
he
come
upon
Sir
William
,
who
,
with
no
one
near
him
but
his
servant
,
be
stand
in
the
pathway
of
a
little
hunting
-
gate

<EOS>
"
hold
hard
,

"
the

"
  
"
be
the

away

sir

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
good
of
that
if
we
can
not
get
the
hound
out
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
he
be
away
.
<EOS>
He
pass
out
where
I
be
stand
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
begin
to
blow
his
horn
lustily
,
and
by
degree
other
man
and
a
few
hound
come
down
the
ride
.
<EOS>
then
Tom
,
with
his
horse
almost
blow
,
make
his
appearance
outside
the
wood
,
and
soon
there
come
a
rush
of
man
,
nearly
on
the
top
of
one
another
,
push
on
,
not
know
whither
,
but
keenly
alive
to
the
fact
that
the
fox
have
at
last
consent
to
move
his
quarter
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
touch
his
hat
,
and
look
at
his
master
,
inquiringly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
go
for
Claydon
's
,
"
say
the
master
.
<EOS>
"
try
them
up
that
hedgerow
.
<EOS>
"
Tom
do
try
them
up
the
hedgerow
,
and
in
half
a
minute
the
hound
come
upon
the
scent
.
<EOS>
then
you
may
see
man
settle
their
hat
on
their
head
,
and
feel
their
foot
in
the
stirrup
.
<EOS>
the
moment
for
which
they
have
so
long
wait
have
come
,
and
yet
there
be
many
who
would
now
have
prefer
that
the
fox
should
be
head
back
into
cover
.
<EOS>
some
have
but
<EOS>
little
confidence
in
their
half
-
blow
horse
;
 
with
many
the
waiting
,
though
so
abused
and
anathematize
,
be
in
truth
more
to
their
taste
than
the
run
itself
;
 
with
other
the
excitement
have
go
by
,
and
a
gallop
over
a
field
or
two
be
necessary
before
it
would
be
restore
.
<EOS>
with
most
man
at
such
a
moment
there
be
a
little
nervousness
,
some
fear
of
make
a
bad
start
,
a
dread
lest
other
should
have
more
of
the
success
of
the
hunt
than
fall
to
them
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
great
rush
and
a
mighty
bustle
as
the
hound
make
out
their
game
,
and
Sir
William
feel
himself
call
upon
to
use
the
rough
side
of
his
tongue
to
more
than
one
delinquent
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
certain
sly
old
stager
may
be
see
turn
off
to
the
left
,
instead
of
follow
the
course
of
the
game
as
indicate
by
the
hound
.
<EOS>
They
be
man
who
have
feel
the
air
as
they
come
out
,
and
know
that
the
fox
must
soon
run
down
wind
,
whatever
he
may
do
for
the
first
half
mile
or
so
,
 
man
who
know
also
which
be
the
short
way
to
Claydon
's
by
the
road
.
<EOS>
ah
,
the
satisfaction
that
there
be
when
these
man
be
throw
out
,
and
their
dead
knowledge
prove
to
be
of
no
avail
!
<EOS>
if
a
fox
will
only
run
straight
,
head
from
the
cover
on
his
real
line
,
these
very
sagacious
gentleman
seldom
come
to
much
honour
and
glory
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
present
instance
the
beast
seem
determined
to
go
straight
enough
,
for
the
hound
run
the
scent
along
three
or
four
hedgerow
in
a
line
.
<EOS>
He
have
manage
to
get
for
himself
full
ten
minute
"
start
,
and
have
be
able
to
leave
the
cover
and
all
his
enemy
well
behind
him
before
he
bethink
himself
as
to
his
good
way
to
his
purposed
destination
.
<EOS>
and
here
,
from
field
to
field
,
there
be
little
hunting
-
gate
at
which
man
crowd
lustily
,
poke
and
shove
each
other
's
horse
,
and
hate
each
other
with
a
bitterness
of
hatred
which
be
,
I
think
,
know
nowhere
else
.
<EOS>
no
hunt
man
ever
want
to
jump
if
he
can
help
it
,
and
the
hedge
near
the
gate
be
not
alluring
.
<EOS>
a
few
there
be
who
make
line
for
themselves
,
take
the
next
field
to
the
right
,
or
scramble
through
the
corner
of
the
fence
while
the
rush
be
go
on
at
the
gate
;
and
among
these
be
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
He
never
ride
in
a
crowd
,
always
keep
himself
somewhat
away
from
man
as
well
as
hound
.
<EOS>
He
would
often
be
throw
out
,
and
then
man
would
hear
no
more
of
him
for
that
day
.
<EOS>
on
such
occasion
he
do
not
show
himself
,
as
other
man
do
,
twenty
minute
after
the
fox
have
be
kill
or
run
to
ground
,
 
but
betook
himself
home
by
himself
,
go
through
the
byeway
and
lane
,
thus
leave
no
report
of
his
failure
to
be
speak
of
by
his
compeer
.
  
<EOS>
as
long
as
the
line
of
gate
last
,
the
crowd
continue
as
thick
as
ever
,
and
the
good
man
be
he
whose
horse
could
shove
the
hardest
.
<EOS>
after
pass
some
four
or
five
field
in
this
way
they
come
out
upon
a
road
,
and
,
the
scent
hold
strong
,
the
dog
cross
it
without
any
demurring
.
<EOS>
then
come
doubt
into
the
mind
of
man
,
many
of
whom
,
before
they
would
venture
away
from
their
position
on
the
lane
,
narrowly
watch
the
lead
hound
to
see
whether
there
be
indication
of
a
turn
to
the
one
side
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
Sir
William
,
whose
seventy
odd
year
excuse
him
,
turn
sharp
to
the
left
,
know
that
he
could
make
Claydon
's
that
way
;
and
very
many
be
the
submissive
horseman
who
follow
him
;
a
few
take
the
road
to
the
right
,
have
in
their
mind
some
little
game
of
their
own
.
<EOS>
the
hard
rider
there
have
already
cross
from
the
road
into
the
country
,
and
be
go
well
to
the
hound
,
ignorant
,
some
of
them
,
of
the
brook
before
them
,
and
other
unheeding
.
<EOS>
foremost
among
these
be
Burgo
Fitzgerald
,
 
Burgo
Fitzgerald
,
whom
no
man
have
ever
know
to
crane
at
a
fence
,
or
to
hug
a
road
,
or
to
spare
his
own
neck
or
his
horse
be
.
<EOS>
and
yet
poor
Burgo
seldom
finish
well
,
 
come
to
repeat
grief
in
this
matter
of
his
hunting
,
as
he
do
so
constantly
in
other
matter
of
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
but
almost
neck
and
neck
with
Burgo
be
Pollock
,
the
sport
literary
gentleman
.
<EOS>
pollock
have
but
two
horse
to
his
stud
,
and
be
never
know
to
give
much
money
for
them
;
 
and
he
weigh
without
his
boot
,
fifteen
stone
!
<EOS>
no
one
ever
know
how
Pollock
do
it
;
 
more
especially
as
all
the
world
declare
that
he
be
as
ignorant
of
hunting
as
any
tailor
.
<EOS>
He
could
ride
,
or
when
he
could
not
ride
he
could
tumble
,
 
man
say
that
of
him
,
 
and
he
would
ride
as
long
as
the
beast
under
him
could
go
.
<EOS>
but
few
know
the
sad
misfortune
which
poor
Pollock
sometimes
encounter
;
 
the
muddy
ditch
in
which
he
be
leave
;
the
despair
with
which
he
would
stand
by
his
unfortunate
horse
when
the
poor
brute
could
no
longer
move
across
some
deep
-
ploughed
field
;
the
mile
that
he
would
walk
at
night
beside
a
tired
animal
,
as
he
make
his
way
slowly
back
to
Roebury
!
  
<EOS>
then
come
Tom
the
huntsman
,
with
Calder
Jones
close
to
him
,
and
Grindley
intent
on
win
his
sovereign
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
have
also
cross
the
road
somewhat
to
the
left
,
carry
with
him
one
or
two
who
know
that
he
be
a
safe
man
to
follow
.
<EOS>
Maxwell
have
be
ignominiously
turn
by
the
hedge
,
which
,
together
with
its
ditch
,
form
a
fence
such
as
all
man
do
not
love
at
the
beginning
of
a
run
.
<EOS>
He
have
turn
from
it
,
acknowledge
the
cause
.
<EOS>
"
by
George
!
"
say
he
,
"
that
be
too
big
for
me
yet
awhile
;
and
there
be
no
end
of
a
river
at
the
bottom
.
<EOS>
"
so
he
have
follow
the
master
down
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
all
those
whom
we
have
name
manage
to
get
over
the
brook
,
Pollock
's
horse
barely
contrive
to
get
up
his
hind
leg
from
the
broken
edge
of
the
bank
.
<EOS>
some
nag
refuse
it
,
and
their
rider
thus
lose
all
their
chance
of
sport
for
that
day
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
lot
of
man
who
hunt
.
<EOS>
a
man
pay
five
or
six
pound
for
his
day
's
amusement
,
and
it
be
ten
to
one
that
the
occurrence
of
the
day
disgust
rather
than
gratify
him
!
<EOS>
one
or
two
get
in
,
and
scramble
out
on
the
other
side
,
but
Tufto
Pearlings
,
the
Manchester
man
from
Friday
Street
,
stick
in
the
mud
at
the
bottom
,
and
could
not
get
his
mare
out
till
seven
man
have
come
with
rope
to
help
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
where
the
devil
be
my
fellow
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
pearling
ask
of
the
countryman
;
but
the
countryman
could
not
tell
him
that
"
his
fellow
"
with
his
second
horse
be
ride
the
hunt
with
great
satisfaction
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
find
that
his
horse
go
with
him
uncommonly
well
,
take
his
fence
almost
in
the
stride
of
his
gallop
,
and
give
unmistakeable
sign
of
good
condition
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
it
be
that
be
amiss
with
him
,
"
say
George
to
himself
,
resolve
,
however
,
that
he
would
sell
him
that
day
if
he
get
an
opportunity
.
<EOS>
Straight
go
the
line
of
the
fox
,
up
from
the
brook
,
and
Tom
begin
to
say
that
his
master
have
be
wrong
about
Claydon
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
we
now
?
"
say
Burgo
,
as
four
or
five
of
them
dash
through
the
open
gate
of
a
farmyard
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
Bulby
's
farm
,
"
say
Tom
,
"
and
we
be
go
right
away
for
Elmham
Wood
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Elmham
wood
be
d
 
---
,
"
say
a
stout
farmer
,
who
have
come
as
far
as
that
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
see
Elmham
Wood
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
know
good
,
"
say
Tom
;
and
then
they
be
through
the
yard
,
across
another
road
,
and
down
a
steep
ravine
by
the
side
of
a
little
copse
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
be
through
them
firs
,
any
way
,
"
say
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
to
him
,
Gaylass
!
"
<EOS>
then
up
they
go
the
other
side
of
the
ravine
,
and
see
the
body
of
the
hound
almost
a
field
before
them
at
the
top
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
 
that
take
some
of
the
wind
out
of
a
fellow
,
"
say
Pollock
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
mind
about
wind
now
,
"
say
Burgo
,
dash
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
not
the
pace
awful
,
come
up
to
that
farmhouse
?
"
say
Calder
Jones
,
look
round
to
see
if
Grindley
be
shake
off
.
<EOS>
but
Grindley
,
with
some
six
or
seven
other
,
be
still
there
.
<EOS>
and
there
,
also
,
always
in
the
next
field
to
the
left
,
be
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
He
have
speak
no
word
to
any
one
since
the
hunt
commence
,
nor
have
he
wish
to
speak
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
He
desire
to
sell
his
horse
,
 
and
he
desire
also
to
succeed
in
the
run
for
other
reason
than
that
,
though
I
think
he
would
have
find
it
difficult
to
define
them
.
  
<EOS>
now
they
have
open
grass
land
for
about
a
mile
,
but
with
very
heavy
fence
,
 
so
that
the
hound
gain
upon
them
a
little
,
and
Pollock
's
weight
begin
to
tell
.
<EOS>
the
huntsman
and
Burgo
be
lead
with
some
fortunate
county
gentleman
whose
good
star
have
bring
him
in
upon
them
at
the
farmyard
gate
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
injustice
of
such
accident
as
this
that
break
the
heart
of
a
man
who
have
honestly
go
through
all
the
heat
and
work
of
the
struggle
!
<EOS>
and
the
hound
have
veer
a
little
round
to
the
left
,
make
,
after
all
,
for
Claydon
's
.
<EOS>
"
darn
if
the
Squire
warn't
<EOS>
right
,
"
say
Tom
.
<EOS>
Sir
William
,
though
a
baronet
,
be
familiarly
call
the
Squire
throughout
the
hunt
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
not
go
for
Claydon
's
now
?
"
ask
Burgo
.
  
<EOS>
"
Them
be
Claydon
's
beech
we
see
over
there
,
"
say
Tom
.
"
<EOS>
"
tain't
often
the
Squire
's
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
they
come
to
a
little
double
rail
and
a
little
quick
-
set
hedge
.
<EOS>
a
double
rail
be
a
nasty
fence
always
if
it
have
be
make
any
way
strong
,
and
one
which
a
man
with
a
wife
and
a
family
be
justify
in
avoid
.
<EOS>
They
mostly
can
be
avoid
,
have
gate
;
and
this
could
have
be
avoid
.
<EOS>
but
Burgo
never
avoid
anything
,
and
go
over
it
beautifully
.
<EOS>
the
difficulty
be
to
be
discreet
when
the
man
before
one
have
be
indiscreet
.
<EOS>
Tom
go
for
the
gate
,
as
do
Pollock
,
who
know
that
he
could
have
no
chance
at
the
double
rail
.
<EOS>
but
Calder
Jones
come
to
infinite
grief
,
strike
the
top
bar
of
the
second
rail
,
and
go
head
-
foremost
out
of
his
saddle
,
as
though
throw
by
a
catapult
.
<EOS>
there
we
must
leave
him
.
<EOS>
Grindley
,
rejoice
greatly
at
this
discomfiture
,
make
for
the
gate
;
but
the
country
gentleman
with
the
fresh
horse
accomplish
the
rail
,
and
be
soon
alongside
of
Burgo
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
you
at
the
start
,
"
say
Burgo
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
do
not
see
you
,
"
say
the
country
gentleman
;
"
so
it
be
even
.
"
  
<EOS>
Burgo
do
not
see
the
thing
in
the
same
light
,
but
he
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
Grindley
and
Tom
be
soon
after
them
,
Tom
do
his
utmost
to
shake
off
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
pollock
be
come
on
also
;
but
the
pace
have
be
too
much
for
him
,
and
though
the
ground
ride
light
his
poor
beast
labour
and
grunt
sorely
.
<EOS>
the
hound
be
still
veer
somewhat
to
the
left
,
and
Burgo
,
jump
over
a
small
fence
into
the
same
field
with
them
,
see
that
there
be
a
horseman
ahead
of
him
.
<EOS>
this
be
George
Vavasor
,
who
be
go
well
,
without
any
symptom
of
distress
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
they
be
at
Claydon
's
,
have
run
over
some
seven
mile
of
ground
in
about
thirty
-
five
minute
.
<EOS>
to
those
who
do
not
know
what
hunting
be
,
this
pace
do
not
seem
very
extraordinary
;
but
it
have
be
quite
quick
enough
,
as
be
testify
by
the
horse
which
have
go
the
distance
.
<EOS>
Our
party
enter
Claydon
's
Park
at
back
,
through
a
gate
in
the
park
paling
that
be
open
on
hunt
day
;
but
a
much
more
numerous
lot
be
there
almost
as
soon
as
them
,
who
have
come
in
by
the
main
entrance
.
<EOS>
this
lot
be
head
by
Sir
William
,
and
our
friend
Maxwell
be
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
jolly
thing
so
far
,
"
say
Burgo
to
Maxwell
;
"
about
the
good
we
have
have
this
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
a
yard
of
it
,
"
say
Maxwell
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
nerve
to
get
off
the
first
road
,
and
I
have
not
be
off
it
ever
since
.
<EOS>
"
Maxwell
be
a
man
who
never
lie
about
his
hunting
,
or
have
the
slight
shame
in
ride
road
.
<EOS>
"
who
be
be
with
you
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
have
be
Tom
and
I
;
 
and
Calder
Jones
be
there
for
a
while
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
kill
himself
somewhere
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
pollock
,
and
your
friend
Grindley
,
and
a
chap
whose
name
I
do
not
know
who
drop
out
of
heaven
about
half
-
way
in
the
run
;
and
there
be
another
man
whose
back
I
see
just
now
;
there
he
be
,
 
by
heaven
,
it
be
Vavasor
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
he
be
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
hang
about
the
Claydon
cover
for
ten
minute
,
and
then
their
fox
go
off
again
,
 
their
fox
or
another
,
as
to
which
there
be
a
great
discussion
afterwards
;
but
he
who
would
have
suggest
the
idea
of
a
new
fox
to
Sir
William
would
have
be
a
bold
man
.
<EOS>
a
fox
,
however
,
go
off
,
turn
still
to
the
left
from
Claydon
's
towards
Roebury
.
<EOS>
those
ten
minute
have
bring
up
some
fifty
man
;
but
it
do
not
bring
up
Calder
Jones
nor
Tufto
Pearlings
,
nor
some
half
-
dozen
other
who
have
already
come
to
serious
misfortune
;
but
Grindley
be
there
,
very
triumphant
in
his
own
success
,
and
already
talk
of
Jones
's
sovereign
.
<EOS>
and
Pollock
be
there
also
,
thankful
for
the
ten
minute
"
law
,
and
trust
that
wind
may
be
give
to
his
horse
to
finish
the
run
triumphantly
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
pace
on
leave
Claydon
's
be
well
than
ever
.
<EOS>
this
may
have
come
from
the
fact
that
the
scent
be
keen
,
as
they
get
out
so
close
upon
their
game
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
they
must
have
change
their
fox
.
<EOS>
Maxwell
,
who
see
him
go
,
swear
that
he
be
fresh
and
clean
.
<EOS>
Burgo
say
that
he
know
it
to
be
the
same
fox
,
but
give
no
reason
.
"
<EOS>
same
fox
!
<EOS>
in
course
it
be
;
why
should
not
it
be
the
same
?
"
say
Tom
.
<EOS>
the
country
gentleman
who
have
drop
from
heaven
be
quite
sure
that
they
have
change
,
and
so
be
most
of
those
who
have
ride
the
road
.
<EOS>
pollock
confine
himself
to
hope
that
he
may
soon
be
kill
,
and
that
thus
his
triumph
for
the
day
may
be
assure
.
  
<EOS>
on
they
go
,
and
the
pace
soon
become
too
good
for
the
poor
author
.
<EOS>
His
horse
at
last
refuse
a
little
hedge
,
and
there
be
not
another
trot
to
be
get
out
of
him
.
<EOS>
that
night
Pollock
turn
up
at
Roebury
about
nine
o'clock
,
very
hungry
,
 
and
it
be
know
that
his
animal
be
alive
;
 
but
the
poor
horse
eat
not
a
grain
of
oats
that
night
,
nor
on
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
have
again
take
a
line
to
himself
,
on
this
occasion
a
little
to
the
right
of
the
meet
;
but
Maxwell
follow
him
and
ride
close
with
him
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
burgo
for
a
while
still
lead
the
body
of
the
field
,
incur
at
first
much
condemnation
from
Sir
William
,
 
nominally
for
hurry
on
among
the
hound
,
but
in
truth
because
he
get
before
Sir
William
himself
.
<EOS>
during
this
latter
part
of
the
run
Sir
William
stick
to
the
hound
in
spite
of
his
seventy
odd
year
.
<EOS>
go
down
into
Marham
Bottom
,
some
four
or
five
be
leave
behind
,
for
they
fear
the
soft
ground
near
the
river
,
and
do
not
know
the
pass
through
it
.
<EOS>
but
Sir
William
know
it
,
and
those
who
remain
close
to
him
get
over
that
trouble
.
<EOS>
Burgo
,
who
would
still
lead
,
nearly
founder
in
the
bog
;
 
but
he
be
light
,
and
his
horse
pull
him
through
,
 
leave
a
fore
-
shoe
in
the
mud
.
<EOS>
after
that
Burgo
be
content
to
give
Sir
William
the
lead
.
  
<EOS>
then
they
come
up
by
Marham
Pits
to
Cleshey
Small
Wood
,
which
they
pass
without
hang
there
a
minute
,
and
over
the
grass
land
of
Cleshey
Farm
.
<EOS>
here
Vavasor
and
Maxwell
join
the
other
,
have
gain
some
three
hundred
yard
in
distance
by
their
course
,
but
have
be
force
to
jump
the
Marham
Stream
which
Sir
William
have
ford
.
<EOS>
the
pace
now
be
as
good
as
the
horse
could
make
it
,
 
and
perhaps
something
well
as
regard
some
of
them
.
<EOS>
Sir
William
's
servant
have
be
with
him
,
and
he
have
get
his
second
horse
at
Claydon
's
;
Maxwell
have
be
equally
fortunate
;
Tom
's
second
horse
have
not
come
up
,
and
his
beast
be
in
great
distress
;
Grindley
have
remain
behind
at
Marham
Bottom
,
be
content
perhaps
with
have
beat
Calder
Jones
,
 
from
whom
by
-
the
-
by
I
may
here
declare
that
he
never
get
his
sovereign
.
<EOS>
Burgo
,
Vavasor
,
and
the
country
gentleman
still
hold
on
;
but
it
be
devoutly
desire
by
all
of
them
that
the
fox
may
soon
come
to
the
end
of
his
tether
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
that
intense
longing
that
the
fox
may
fail
,
when
the
failing
of
the
horse
begin
to
make
themselves
know
,
 
and
<EOS>
the
consciousness
come
on
that
all
that
one
have
do
will
go
for
nothing
unless
the
thing
can
be
bring
to
a
close
in
a
field
or
two
!
<EOS>
so
far
you
have
triumph
,
leave
score
of
man
behind
;
but
of
what
good
be
all
that
,
if
you
also
be
to
be
leave
behind
at
the
last
?
  
<EOS>
It
be
manifest
now
to
all
who
know
the
country
that
the
fox
be
make
for
Thornden
Deer
Park
,
but
Thornden
Deer
Park
be
still
two
mile
ahead
of
them
,
and
the
hound
be
so
near
to
their
game
that
the
poor
beast
could
hardly
hope
to
live
till
he
get
there
.
<EOS>
He
have
try
a
well
-
know
drain
near
Cleshey
Farm
House
;
but
it
have
be
inhospitably
,
nay
cruelly
,
close
against
him
.
<EOS>
soon
after
that
he
throw
himself
down
in
a
ditch
,
and
the
eager
hound
overrun
him
,
give
him
a
moment
's
law
,
 
and
give
also
a
moment
's
law
to
horse
that
want
it
as
badly
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
about
do
for
,
"
say
Burgo
to
Maxwell
.
"
<EOS>
luckily
for
you
,
"
say
Maxwell
,
"
the
fox
be
much
in
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
the
fox
have
still
more
power
leave
in
him
than
poor
Burgo
Fitzgerald
's
horse
.
<EOS>
He
gain
a
minute
's
check
and
then
he
start
again
,
be
view
away
by
Sir
William
himself
.
<EOS>
the
country
gentleman
of
whom
mention
have
be
make
also
view
him
,
and
holloa'd
as
he
do
so
:
"
yoick
,
tally
;
go
away
!
"
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
man
!

<EOS>
"
do
you
suppose
I

"
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
country
gentleman
retreat
,
and
become
less
conspicuous
than
he
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
away
they
go
again
,
off
Cleshey
and
into
Thornden
parish
,
on
the
land
of
Sorrel
Farm
,
 
a
spot
well
to
be
remember
by
one
or
two
ever
afterwards
.
<EOS>
here
Sir
William
make
for
a
gate
which
take
him
a
little
out
of
the
line
,
but
Maxwell
and
Burgo
Fitzgerald
,
follow
by
Vavasor
,
go
straight
ahead
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
huge
ditch
and
boundary
bank
there
which
Sir
William
have
know
and
have
avoid
.
<EOS>
Maxwell
,
whose
pluck
have
return
to
him
at
last
,
take
it
well
.
<EOS>
His
horse
be
comparatively
fresh
and
make
nothing
of
it
.
<EOS>
then
come
poor
Burgo
!
<EOS>
oh
,
Burgo
,
hadst
thou
not
have
be
a
very
child
,
thou
shouldst
have
know
that
now
,
at
this
time
of
the
day
,
 
after
all
that
thy
gallant
horse
have
do
for
thee
,
 
it
be
impossible
to
thee
or
him
.
<EOS>
but
when
do
Burgo
Fitzgerald
know
anything
?
<EOS>
He
ride
at
the
bank
as
though
it
have
be
the
first
fence
of
the
day
,
strike
his
poor
beast
with
his
spur
,
as
though
muscle
,
strength
,
and
new
power
could
be
impart
by
their
rowel
.
<EOS>
the
animal
rise
at
the
bank
and
in
some
way
get
upon
it
,
scramble
as
he
strike
it
with
his
chest
,
and
then
fall
headlong
into
the
ditch
at
the
other
side
,
a
confuse
mass
of
head
,
limb
,
and
body
.
<EOS>
His
career
be
at
an
end
,
and
he
have
break
his
heart
!
<EOS>
poor
noble
beast
,
noble
in
vain
!
<EOS>
to
his
very
last
gasp
he
have
do
his
good
,
and
have
deserve
that
he
should
have
be
in
well
hand
.
<EOS>
His
master
's
ignorance
have
kill
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
man
who
never
know
how
little
a
horse
can
do
,
 
or
how
much
!
  
<EOS>
there
be
to
some
extent
a
gap
in
the
fence
when
Maxwell
have
first
ride
it
and
Burgo
have
follow
him
;
a
gap
,
or
break
in
the
hedge
at
the
top
,
indicate
plainly
the
place
at
which
a
horse
could
best
get
over
.
<EOS>
to
this
spot
Vavasor
follow
,
and
be
on
the
bank
at
Burgo
's
heel
before
he
know
what
have
happen
.
<EOS>
but
the
man
have
get
away
and
only
the
horse
lie
there
in
the
ditch
.
<EOS>
"
be
you
hurt
?
"
say
Vavasor
;
"
can
I
do
anything
?
"
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
stop
,
"
if
you
can
find
a
chap
just
send
him
to
me
,
"
say
Burgo
in
a
melancholy
tone
.
<EOS>
then
he
sit
down
,
with
his
foot
in
the
ditch
,
and
look
at
the
carcase
of
his
horse
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
more
need
of
jump
that
day
.
<EOS>
the
way
be
open
into
the
next
field
,
 
a
turnip
field
,
 
and
there
amidst
the
crisp
break
turnip
-
top
,
with
the
breath
of
his
enemy
hot
upon
him
,
with
their
sharp
tooth
at
his
entrail
,
bite
at
them
impotently
in
the
agony
of
his
death
struggle
,
poor
Reynard
finish
his
career
.
<EOS>
Maxwell
be
certainly
the
first
there
,
 
but
Sir
William
and
George
Vavasor
be
close
upon
him
.
<EOS>
that
take
of
brush
of
which
we
use
to
hear
be
a
little
out
of
fashion
;
but
if
such
honour
be
due
to
any
one
it
be
due
to
Vavasor
,
for
he
and
he
only
have
ride
the
hunt
throughout
.
<EOS>
but
he
claim
no
honour
,
and
none
be
specially
give
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
and
Maxwell
ride
homeward
together
,
have
send
assistance
to
poor
Burgo
Fitzgerald
;
and
as
they
go
along
the
road
,
say
but
little
to
each
other
,
Maxwell
,
in
a
very
indifferent
voice
,
ask
him
a
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
want
for
that
horse
,
Vavasor
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
hundred
and
fifty
,
"
say
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
mine
,
"
say
Maxwell
.
<EOS>
so
the
brown
horse
be
sell
for
about
half
his
value
,
because
he
have
bring
with
him
a
bad
character

<EOS>
Burgo
Fitzgerald
,
of
whose
hunting
experience
something
have
be
tell
in
the
last
chapter
,
be
a
young
man
bear
in
the
purple
of
the
english
aristocracy
.
<EOS>
He
be
relate
to
half
the
duke
in
the
kingdom
,
and
have
three
countess
for
his
aunt
.
<EOS>
when
he
come
of
age
he
be
master
of
a
sufficient
fortune
to
make
it
quite
out
of
the
question
that
he
should
be
ask
to
earn
his
bread
;
and
though
that
,
and
other
windfall
that
have
come
to
him
,
have
long
since
be
spend
,
no
one
have
ever
make
to
him
so
ridiculous
a
proposition
as
that
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
thirty
,
and
for
some
year
past
have
be
know
to
be
much
bad
than
penniless
;
but
still
he
live
on
in
the
same
circle
,
still
sleep
softly
and
drank
of
the
good
,
and
go
about
with
his
valet
and
his
groom
and
his
horse
,
and
fare
sumptuously
every
day
.
<EOS>
some
people
say
the
countess
do
it
for
him
,
and
some
say
that
it
be
the
duke
;
 
while
other
,
again
,
declare
that
the
Jews
be
his
most
generous
friend
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
he
still
seem
to
live
as
he
have
always
live
,
set
tradesman
at
defiance
,
and
laugh
to
scorn
all
the
rule
which
regulate
the
life
of
other
man
.
  
<EOS>
about
eighteen
month
before
the
time
of
which
I
be
now
speak
,
a
great
chance
have
come
in
this
young
man
's
way
,
and
he
have
almost
succeed
in
make
himself
one
of
the
rich
man
in
England
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
then
a
great
heiress
in
the
land
,
on
whom
the
property
of
half
-
a
-
dozen
ancient
family
have
concentrate
;
and
Burgo
,
who
in
spite
of
his
iniquity
still
keep
his
position
in
the
drawing
-
room
of
the
great
,
have
almost
succeed
in
obtain
the
hand
and
the
wealth
,
 
as
people
still
say
that
he
have
obtain
the
heart
,
 
of
the
Lady
Glencora
M'Cluskie
.
<EOS>
but
sundry
mighty
magnate
,
drive
almost
to
despair
at
the
prospect
of
such
a
sacrifice
,
have
sagaciously
put
their
head
together
,
and
the
result
have
be
that
the
Lady
Glencora
have
hear
reason
.
<EOS>
She
have
listen
,
 
with
many
haughty
tossing
indeed
of
her
proud
little
head
,
with
many
throbbing
of
her
passionate
young
heart
;
but
in
the
end
she
listen
and
hear
reason
.
<EOS>
She
see
Burgo
,
for
the
last
time
,
and
tell
him
that
she
be
the
promised
bride
of
Plantagenet
Palliser
,
nephew
and
heir
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
bear
it
like
a
man
,
 
never
have
groan
openly
,
or
quiver
once
before
any
comrade
at
the
name
of
the
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
She
have
marry
Mr.
Palliser
at
St.
George
's
Square
,
and
on
the
morning
of
the
marriage
he
have
hang
about
his
club
door
in
Pall
Mall
,
listen
to
the
bell
,
and
say
a
word
or
two
about
the
wedding
,
with
admirable
courage
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
for
him
a
great
chance
,
 
and
he
have
lose
it
.
<EOS>
who
can
say
,
too
,
that
his
only
regret
be
for
the
money
?
<EOS>
He
have
speak
once
of
it
to
a
married
sister
of
his
,
in
whose
house
he
have
first
meet
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
marry
now
,
 
that
be
all

he
say
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
go
about
,
live
his
old
reckless
life
,
with
the
same
recklessness
as
ever
.
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
those
young
man
with
dark
hair
and
blue
eye
,
 
who
wear
no
beard
,
and
be
certainly
among
the
handsome
of
all
God
's
creature
.
<EOS>
no
more
handsome
man
than
Burgo
Fitzgerald
live
in
his
day
;
and
this
merit
at
any
rate
be
his
,
 
that
he
think
nothing
of
his
own
beauty
.
<EOS>
but
he
live
ever
without
conscience
,
without
purpose
,
 
with
no
idea
that
it
behove
him
as
a
man
to
do
anything
but
eat
and
drink
,
 
or
ride
well
to
hound
till
some
poor
brute
,
much
noble
than
himself
,
perish
beneath
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
chiefly
concern
our
story
at
this
present
time
because
the
Lady
Glencora
who
have
love
him
,
 
and
would
have
marry
<EOS>
him
have
not
those
sagacious
head
prevent
it
<EOS>
,
 
be
a
cousin
of
Alice
Vavasor
's
.
<EOS>
She
be
among
those
very
great
relation
with
whom
Alice
be
connect
by
her
mother
's
side
,
 
be
indeed
so
near
to
Lady
Macleod
,
that
she
be
first
cousin
to
that
lady
,
only
once
remove
.
<EOS>
Lady
Midlothian
be
aunt
to
the
Lady
Glencora
,
and
our
Alice
may
have
call
cousin
,
and
not
be
forbid
,
with
the
old
Lord
of
the
Isles
,
Lady
Glencora
's
father
,
 
who
be
dead
,
however
,
some
time
previous
to
that
affair
with
Burgo
,
 
and
with
the
Marquis
of
Auld
Reekie
,
who
be
Lady
Glencora
's
uncle
,
and
have
be
her
guardian
.
<EOS>
but
Alice
have
keep
herself
aloof
from
her
grand
relation
on
her
mother
's
side
,
choose
rather
to
hold
herself
as
belong
to
those
who
be
her
father
's
kindre
.
<EOS>
with
Lady
Glencora
,
however
,
she
have
for
a
short
time
 
for
some
week
or
ten
day
,
 
be
on
term
of
almost
affectionate
intimacy
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
then
,
when
the
wayward
heiress
with
the
bright
waving
lock
have
be
most
strongly
minded
to
give
herself
and
her
wealth
to
Burgo
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
Burgo
have
have
money
dealing
with
George
Vavasor
,
and
know
him
,
 
know
him
intimately
,
and
have
learn
the
fact
of
his
cousinship
between
the
heiress
and
his
friend
's
cousin
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
in
the
agony
of
those
week
in
which
the
sagacious
head
be
resist
her
love
,
Lady
Glencora
come
to
her
cousin
in
Queen
Anne
Street
,
and
tell
Alice
all
that
tale
.
"
<EOS>
be
Alice
,
"
she
ask
,
"
afraid
of
the
marquise
and
the
countess
,
or
of
all
the
rank
and
all
the
money
which
they
boast
?
"
<EOS>
Alice
answer
that
she
be
not
at
all
afraid
of
them
.
"
<EOS>
then
would
she
permit
Lady
Glencora
and
Burgo
to
see
each
other
in
the
drawing
-
room
at
Queen
Anne
Street
,
just
once
!
"
<EOS>
just
once
,
 
so
that
they
may
arrange
that
little
plan
of
an
elopement
.
<EOS>
but
Alice
could
not
do
that
for
her
newly
find
cousin
.
<EOS>
She
endeavour
to
explain
that
it
be
not
the
dignity
of
the
sagacious
head
which
stand
in
her
way
,
but
her
woman
's
feeling
of
what
be
right
and
wrong
in
such
a
matter
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
I
not
marry
him
?
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
with
her
eye
flash
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
my
equal
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
explain
that
she
have
no
word
to
say
against
such
a
marriage
.
<EOS>
She
counsel
her
cousin
to
be
true
to
her
love
if
her
love
be
in
itself
true
.
<EOS>
but
she
,
an
unmarried
woman
,
who
have
hitherto
not
know
her
cousin
,
may
not
give
such
help
as
that
!
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
not
help
me
,
I
be
helpless
!
"
say
the
Lady
Glencora
,
and
then
she
kneel
at
Alice
's
knee
and
throw
her
wavy
lock
abroad
on
Alice
's
lap
.
<EOS>
"
how
shall
I
bribe
you
?
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
next
to
him
I
will
love
you
better
than
all
the
world
.
"
<EOS>
but
Alice
,
though
she
kiss
the
fair
forehead
and
own
that
such
reward
would
be
worth
much
to
her
,
could
not
take
any
bribe
for
such
a
cause
.
<EOS>
then
Lady
Glencora
have
be
angry
with
her
,
call
her
heartless
,
and
threaten
her
that
she
too
may
have
sorrow
of
her
own
and
want
assistance
.
<EOS>
Alice
tell
nothing
of
her
own
tale
,
 
how
she
have
love
her
cousin
and
have
be
force
to
give
him
up
,
but
say
what
kind
word
she
could
,
and
she
of
the
wave
hair
and
light
blue
eye
have
be
pacify
.
<EOS>
then
she
have
come
again
,
 
have
come
daily
while
the
sagacious
head
be
at
work
,
 
and
Alice
in
her
trouble
have
be
a
comfort
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
sagacious
head
be
victorious
,
as
we
know
,
and
Lady
Glencora
M'Cluskie
become
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
with
all
the
propriety
in
the
world
,
instead
of
become
wife
to
poor
Burgo
,
with
all
imaginable
impropriety
.
<EOS>
and
then
she
write
a
letter
to
Alice
,
very
short
and
rather
sad
;
but
still
with
a
certain
sweetness
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
She
have
be
counsel
that
it
be
not
fitting
for
her
to
love
as
she
have
think
to
love
,
and
she
have
resolve
to
give
up
her
dream
.
<EOS>
Her
cousin
Alice
,
she
know
,
would
respect
her
secret
.
<EOS>
She
be
go
to
become
the
wife
of
the
good
man
<EOS>
,
she
think
,
in
all
the
world
;
and
it
should
be
the
one
care
of
her
life
to
make
him
happy
.
"
<EOS>
She
say
not
a
word
in
all
her
letter
of
love
this
newly
find
lord
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
to
be
marry
at
once
.
<EOS>
Would
Alice
be
one
among
the
bevy
of
bridesmaid
who
be
to
grace
the
ceremony
?
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
wish
her
joy
heartily
,
 
"
heartily
,
"
she
say
,
but
have
decline
that
office
of
bridesmaid
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
wish
to
undergo
the
cold
look
of
the
Lady
Julias
and
Lady
Janes
who
all
would
know
each
other
,
but
none
of
whom
would
know
her
.
<EOS>
so
she
send
her
cousin
a
little
ring
,
and
ask
her
to
keep
it
amidst
all
the
wealthy
tribute
of
marriage
gift
which
would
be
pour
forth
at
her
foot
.
  
<EOS>
from
that
time
to
this
present
Alice
have
hear
no
more
of
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
marry
late
in
the
precede
season
and
have
go
away
with
Mr.
Palliser
,
spend
her
honeymoon
amidst
the
softness
of
some
italian
lake
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
return
to
England
till
the
time
have
come
for
them
to
encounter
the
magnificent
Christmas
festivity
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
uncle
,
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
Gatherum
Castle
,
the
vast
palace
which
the
Duke
have
build
at
a
cost
of
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
million
,
be
open
,
as
it
have
never
be
open
before
;
 
for
the
Duke
's
heir
have
marry
to
the
Duke
's
liking
,
and
the
Duke
be
a
man
who
could
do
such
thing
handsomely
when
he
be
well
pleased
.
<EOS>
then
there
have
be
a
throng
of
bridal
guest
,
and
a
succession
of
bridal
gaiety
which
have
continue
themselves
even
past
the
time
at
which
Mr.
Palliser
be
due
at
Westminster
;
 
and
Mr.
Palliser
be
a
legislator
who
serve
his
country
with
the
utmost
assiduity
.
<EOS>
so
the
London
season
commence
,
progress
,
and
be
consume
;
and
still
Alice
hear
nothing
more
of
her
friend
and
cousin
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
have
trouble
her
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
a
chance
circumstance
,
the
story
of
which
she
have
tell
to
no
one
,
have
give
her
a
short
intimacy
with
this
fair
child
of
the
gold
mine
,
but
she
have
feel
that
they
two
could
not
live
together
in
habit
of
much
intimacy
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
when
think
of
the
young
bride
,
only
think
of
that
wild
love
episode
in
the
girl
's
life
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
strange
to
her
that
she
should
in
one
week
have
listen
to
the
most
passionate
protestation
from
her
friend
of
love
for
one
man
,
and
then
have
be
tell
in
the
next
that
another
man
be
to
be
her
friend
's
husband
!
<EOS>
but
she
reflect
that
her
own
career
be
much
the
same
,
 
only
with
the
interval
of
some
long
time
.
  
<EOS>
but
her
own
career
be
not
the
same
.
<EOS>
Glencora
have
marry
Mr.
Palliser
,
 
have
marry
him
without
pause
to
doubt
;
 
but
Alice
have
go
on
doubt
till
at
last
<EOS>
she
have
resolve
that
she
would
not
marry
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
She
think
of
this
much
in
those
day
at
Cheltenham
,
and
wonder
often
whether
Glencora
live
with
her
husband
in
the
full
happiness
of
conjugal
love
.
  
<EOS>
one
morning
,
about
three
day
after
Mr.
Grey
's
visit
,
there
come
to
her
two
letter
,
as
to
neither
of
which
do
she
know
the
writer
by
the
handwriting
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
have
tell
her
,
 
with
some
hesitation
,
indeed
,
for
Lady
Macleod
be
afraid
of
her
,
 
but
have
tell
her
,
nevertheless
,
more
than
once
,
that
those
noble
relative
have
hear
of
the
treatment
to
which
Mr.
Grey
be
be
subject
,
and
have
express
their
great
sorrow
,
 
if
not
dismay
or
almost
anger
.
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
,
indeed
,
have
go
as
far
as
she
dare
,
and
may
have
go
further
without
any
sacrifice
of
truth
.
<EOS>
Lady
Midlothian
have
say
that
it
would
be
disgraceful
to
the
family
,
and
Lady
Glencora
's
aunt
,
the
Marchioness
of
Auld
Reekie
,
have
demand
to
be
tell
what
it
be
the
girl
want
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
letter
come
Lady
Macleod
be
not
present
,
and
I
be
dispose
to
think
that
one
of
them
have
be
write
by
concerted
arrangement
with
her
.
<EOS>
but
if
so
she
have
not
dare
to
watch
the
immediate
effect
of
her
own
projectile
.
<EOS>
this
one
be
from
Lady
Midlothian
.
<EOS>
of
the
other
Lady
Macleod
certainly
know
nothing
,
though
it
also
have
spring
out
of
the
discussion
which
have
take
place
as
to
Alice
's
sin
in
the
Auld
Reekie
-
Midlothian
set
.
<EOS>
this
other
letter
be
from
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
Alice
open
the
two
,
one
without
read
the
other
,
very
slowly
.
<EOS>
Lady
Midlothian
's
be
the
first
open
,
and
then
come
a
spot
of
anger
on
Alice
's
cheek
as
she
see
the
signature
,
and
catch
a
word
or
two
as
she
allow
her
eye
to
glance
down
the
page
.
<EOS>
then
she
open
the
other
,
which
be
short
,
and
when
she
see
her
cousin
's
signature
,
"
Glencora
Palliser
,
"
she
read
that
letter
first
,
 
read
it
twice
before
she
go
back
to
the
disagreeable
task
of
peruse
Lady
Midlothian
's
lecture
.
<EOS>
the
reader
shall
have
both
the
letter
,
but
that
from
the
Countess
shall
have
precedence
.

<EOS>
my
dear
MISS
VAVASOR
,
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
pleasure
of
know
you
personally
,
though
I
have
hear
of
you
very
often
from
our
dear
mutual
friend
and
relative
Lady
Macleod
,
with
whom
I
understand
that
you
be
at
present
on
a
visit
.
<EOS>
Your
grandmother

the
mother
's
side
,
 
Lady
Flora
Macleod
,
and
my
mother
the
Countess

sister
;
and
though
circumstance
since
that
have
prevent
our
see
so
much
of
each
other
as
be
desirable
,
I
have
always
remember
the
connection
,
and
have
ever
regard
you
as
one
in
whose
welfare
I
be
bind
by
tie
of
blood
to
take
a
warm
interest
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
since
that
!
"
 
<EOS>
what
do
she
mean
by
"
since
that
'
?
"
say
Alice
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
She
have
never
set
eye
on
me
at
all
.
<EOS>
why
do
she
talk
of
not
have
see
as
much
of
me
as
be
desirable
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
learn
with
great
gratification
that
you
be
go
to
be
marry
to
a
most
worthy
gentleman
,
Mr.
John
Grey
of
Nethercoats
,
in
Cambridgeshire
.
<EOS>
when
I
first
hear
this
I
make
it
my
business
to
institute
some
inquiry
,
and
I
be
heartily
glad
to
find
that
your
choice
have
do
you
so
much
credit
.
<EOS>
[
if
the
reader
have
read
Alice
's
character
as
I
have
mean
it
should
be
read
,
it
will
thoroughly
be
understand
that
this
be
wormwood
to
her
.
]
<EOS>
I
be
inform
that
Mr.
Grey
be
in
every
respect
a
gentleman
,
 
that
he
be
a
man
of
most
excellent
habit
,
and
one
to
whom
any
young
woman
could
commit
her
future
happiness
with
security
,
that
his
mean
be
very
good
for
his
position
,
and
that
there
be
no
possible
objection
to
such
a
marriage
.
<EOS>
all
this
give
great
satisfaction
to
me
,
in
which
I
be
join
by
the
Marchioness
of
Auld
Reekie
,
who
be
connect
with
you
almost
as
nearly
as
I
be
,
and
who
,
I
can
assure
you
,
feel
a
considerable
interest
in
your
welfare
.
<EOS>
I
be
stay
with
her
now
,
and
in
all
that
I
say
,
she
agree
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
feel
then
how
dreadfully
we
be
dismay
when
we
be
tell
by
dear
Lady
Macleod
that
you
have
tell
Mr.
Grey
that
you
intend
to
change
your
mind
!
<EOS>
My
dear
Miss
Vavasor
,
can
this
be
true
?
<EOS>
there
be
thing
in
which
a
young
lady
have
no
right
to
change
her
mind
after
it
have
be
once
make
up
;
and
certainly
when
a
young
lady
have
accept
a
gentleman
,
that
be
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
legally
make
you
become
his
wife
,
but
he
have
a
right
to
claim
you
before
God
and
man
.
<EOS>
have
you
consider
that
he
have
probably
furnish
his
house
in
consequence
of
his
intended
marriage
,
 
and
perhaps
in
compliance
with
your
own
especial
wish
?
<EOS>
[
I
think
that
Lady
Macleod
must
have
tell
the
Countess
something
that
she
have
hear
about
the
garden
.
]
<EOS>
have
you
reflect
that
he
have
of
course
tell
all
his
friend
?
<EOS>
have
you
any
reason
to
give
?
<EOS>
I
be
tell
,
none
!
<EOS>
nothing
should
ever
be
do
without
a
reason
;
much
less
such
a
thing
as
this
in
which
your
own
interest
and
,
I
may
say
,
respectability
be
involve
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
think
of
this
before
you
persist
in
destroy
your
own
happiness
and
perhaps
that
of
a
very
worthy
man
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
hear
,
some
year
ago
,
when
you
be
much
young
,
that
you
have
become
imprudently
attach
in
another
direction
 
with
a
gentleman
with
none
of
those
quality
to
recommend
him
which
speak
so
highly
for
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
It
would
grieve
me
very
much
,
as
it
would
also
the
Marchioness
,
who
in
this
matter
think
exactly
as
I
do
,
if
I
be
lead
to
suppose
that
your
rejection
of
Mr.
Grey
have
be
cause
by
_
any
renewal
of
that
project
_
.
<EOS>
nothing
,
my
dear
Miss
Vavasor
,
could
be
more
unfortunate
,
 
and
I
may
almost
add
a
strong
word
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
advise
that
a
line
from
me
as
represent
your
poor
mother
's
family
,
especially
as
I
have
at
the
present
moment
the
opportunity
of
express
Lady
<EOS>
Auld
Reekie
's
sentiment
as
well
as
my
own
,
may
be
of
service
.
<EOS>
I
implore
you
,
my
dear
Miss
Vavasor
,
to
remember
what
you
owe
to
God
and
man
,
and
to
carry
out
an
engagement
make
by
yourself
,
that
be
in
all
respect
comme
il
faut
,
and
which
will
give
entire
satisfaction
to
your
friend
and
relative
.
  
<EOS>
MARGARET
M.
MIDLOTHIAN
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
that
Lady
Macleod
have
be
wrong
in
supposing
that
this
could
do
any
good
.
<EOS>
She
should
have
know
Alice
better
;
and
should
also
have
know
the
world
better
.
<EOS>
but
her
own
reverence
for
her
own
noble
relative
be
so
great
that
she
could
not
understand
,
even
yet
,
that
all
such
feeling
be
want
to
her
niece
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
her
impossible
that
the
expressed
opinion
of
such
an
one
as
the
Countess
of
Midlothian
,
own
her
relationship
and
solicitude
,
and
condescend
at
the
same
time
to
express
friendship
,
 
she
could
not
,
I
say
,
understand
that
the
voice
of
such
an
one
,
so
speak
,
should
have
no
weight
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
that
she
have
be
quite
right
in
keep
out
of
Alice
's
way
at
the
moment
of
the
arrival
of
the
letter
.
<EOS>
Alice
read
it
,
slowly
,
and
then
replace
it
in
its
envelope
,
lean
back
quietly
in
her
chair
,
 
with
her
eye
fix
upon
the
teapot
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
however
,
the
other
letter
on
which
to
occupy
her
mind
,
and
thus
relieve
her
from
the
effect
of
too
deep
an
animosity
against
the
Countess
.
  
<EOS>
the
Lady
Glencora
's
letter
be
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
Matching
Priory
,
Thursday
.
  
<EOS>
dear
COUSIN
,
  
<EOS>
I
have
just
come
home
from
Scotland
,
where
they
have
be
tell
me
something
of
your
little
trouble
.
<EOS>
I
have
little
trouble
once
too
,
and
you
be
so
good
to
me
!
<EOS>
Will
you
come
to
us
here
for
a
few
week
?
<EOS>
We
shall
be
here
till
Christmas
-
time
,
when
we
go
somewhere
else
.
<EOS>
I
have
tell
my
husband
that
you
be
a
great
friend
of
mine
as
well
as
a
cousin
,
and
that
he
must
be
good
to
you
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
quiet
,
and
work
very
hard
at
politic
;
but
I
think
you
will
like
him
.
<EOS>
do
come
!
<EOS>
there
will
be
a
good
many
people
here
,
so
that
you
will
not
find
it
dull
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
name
the
day
we
will
send
the
carriage
for
you
at
Matching
Station
,
and
I
dare
say
I
can
manage
to
come
myself
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
affectionately
,
  
G.
PALLISER
.
  
<EOS>
P.S.
<EOS>
I
know
what
will
be
in
your
mind
.
<EOS>
You
will
say
,
why
do
not
she
come
to
me
in
London
?
<EOS>
She
know
the
way
to
Queen
Anne
Street
well
enough
.
<EOS>
dear
Alice
,
do
not
say
that
.
<EOS>
believe
me
,
I
have
much
to
do
and
think
of
in
London
.
<EOS>
and
if
I
be
wrong
,
yet
you
will
forgive
me
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
say
I
be
to
give
you
his
love
,
 
as
be
a
cousin
,
 
and
say
that
you
must
come
!
  
<EOS>
this
letter
be
certainly
well
than
the
other
,
but
Alice
,
on
read
it
,
come
to
a
resolve
that
she
would
not
accept
the
invitation
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
even
that
allusion
to
her
little
trouble
jar
upon
her
feeling
;
and
then
she
think
that
her
rejection
of
Mr.
Grey
could
be
no
special
reason
why
she
should
go
to
Matching
Priory
.
<EOS>
be
it
not
very
possible
that
she
have
be
invite
that
she
may
meet
Lady
Midlothian
there
,
and
encounter
all
the
strength
of
a
personal
battery
from
the
Countess
?
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
's
letter
she
would
of
course
answer
,
but
to
Lady
Midlothian
she
would
not
condescend
to
make
any
reply
whatever
.
  
<EOS>
about
eleven
o'clock
Lady
Macleod
come
down
to
her
.
<EOS>
for
half
-
an
-
hour
or
so
Alice
say
nothing
;
nor
do
Lady
Macleod
ask
any
question
.
<EOS>
She
look
inquisitively
at
Alice
,
eye
the
letter
which
be
lie
by
the
side
of
her
niece
's
workbasket
,
but
she
say
no
word
about
Mr.
Grey
or
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
at
last
Alice
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aunt
,
"
she
say
,
"
I
have
have
a
letter
this
morning
from
your
friend
,
Lady
Midlothian
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
my
cousin
,
Alice
;
and
your
as
much
as
mine
.
"
  
"
Your
cousin
then
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
of
more
moment
that
she
be
your
friend
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
be
not
mine
,
nor
can
her
cousinship
afford
any
justification
for
her
interfere
in
my
affair
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Alice
,
 
from
her
position
 
"
  
"
Her
position
can
be
nothing
to
me
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
submit
to
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
her
letter
,
which
you
can
read
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
after
that
you
may
burn
it
.
<EOS>
I
need
hardly
say
that
I
shall
not
answer
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
what
be
I
to
say
to
her
,
Alice
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
nothing
from
me
,
aunt
;
 
from
yourself
,
whatever
you
please
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
then
there
be
silence
between
them
for
a
few
minute
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
have
have
another
letter
,
from
Lady
Glencora
,
who
marry
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
whom
I
know
in
London
last
spring
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
have
that
offend
you
,
too
?
"
  
"
no
,
there
be
no
offence
in
that
.
<EOS>
She
ask
me
to
go
and
see
her
at
Matching
Priory
,
her
husband
's
house
;
but
I
shall
not
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
at
last
Alice
agree
to
pay
this
visit
,
and
it
may
be
as
well
to
explain
here
how
she
be
bring
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
write
to
Lady
Glencora
,
decline
,
and
explain
frankly
that
she
do
decline
,
because
she
think
it
probable
that
she
may
there
meet
Lady
Midlothian
.
<EOS>
Lady
Midlothian
,
she
say
,
have
interfere
very
unwarrantably
in
her
affair
,
and
she
do
not
wish
to
make
her
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
to
this
Lady
Glencora
reply
,
post
haste
,
that
she
have
intend
no
such
horrid
treachery
as
that
for
Alice
;
that
neither
would
Lady
Midlothian
be
there
,
nor
any
of
that
set
;
by
which
Alice
know
that
Lady
Glencora
refer
specially
to
her
aunt
the
Marchioness
;
that
no
one
would
be
at
match
who
could
torment
Alice
,
either
with
right
or
without
it
,
"
except
so
far
as
I
myself
may
do
so
,
"
Lady
Glencora
say
;
and
then
she
name
an
early
day
in
November
,
at
which
she
would
herself
undertake
to
meet
Alice
at
the
Matching
Station
.
<EOS>
on
receipt
of
this
letter
,
Alice
,
after
two
day
'
doubt
,
accept
the
invitation
.
   
<EOS>
Tribute
from
Oileymead
.
 
<EOS>
Kate
Vavasor
,
in
write
to
her
cousin
Alice
,
feel
some
little
difficulty
in
excuse
herself
for
remain
in
Norfolk
with
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
She
have
laugh
at
Mrs.
Greenow
before
she
go
to
Yarmouth
,
and
have
laugh
at
herself
for
go
there
.
<EOS>
and
in
all
her
letter
since
,
she
have
speak
of
her
aunt
as
a
silly
,
vain
,
worldly
woman
,
weep
crocodile
tear
,
for
an
old
husband
whose
death
have
release
her
from
the
tedium
of
his
company
,
and
spread
lur
to
catch
new
lover
.
<EOS>
but
yet
she
agree
to
stay
with
her
aunt
,
and
remain
with
her
in
lodging
at
Norwich
for
a
month
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Greenow
have
about
her
something
more
than
Kate
have
acknowledge
when
she
first
attempt
to
read
her
aunt
's
character
.
<EOS>
She
be
clever
,
and
in
her
own
way
persuasive
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
generous
,
and
possess
a
certain
power
of
make
herself
pleasant
to
those
around
her
.
<EOS>
in
ask
Kate
to
stay
with
her
she
have
so
ask
as
to
make
it
appear
that
Kate
be
to
confer
the
favour
.
<EOS>
She
have
tell
her
niece
that
she
be
all
alone
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
money
,
"
she
have
say
,
with
more
appearance
of
true
feeling
than
Kate
have
observe
before
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
money
,
but
I
have
nothing
else
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
home
.
<EOS>
why
should
I
not
remain
here
in
Norfolk
,
where
I
know
a
few
people
?
<EOS>
if
you
will
say
that
you
will
go
anywhere
else
with
me
,
I
will
go
to
any
place
you
will
name
.
<EOS>
"
Kate
have
believe
this
to
be
hardly
true
.
<EOS>
She
have
feel
sure
that
her
aunt
wish
to
remain
in
the
neighbourhood
of
her
seaside
admirer
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
she
have
yield
,
and
at
the
end
of
October
the
two
lady
,
with
Jeannette
,
settle
themselves
in
comfortable
lodging
within
the
precinct
of
the
Close
at
Norwich
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Greenow
at
this
time
have
be
dead
very
nearly
six
month
,
but
his
widow
make
some
mistake
in
her
date
and
appear
to
think
that
the
interval
have
be
long
.
<EOS>
on
the
day
of
their
arrival
at
Norwich
it
be
evident
that
this
error
have
confirm
itself
in
her
mind
.
"
<EOS>
only
think
,
"
she
say
,
as
she
unpack
a
little
miniature
of
the
depart
one
,
and
sit
with
it
for
a
moment
in
her
hand
,
as
she
press
her
handkerchief
to
her
eye
,
"
only
think
,
that
it
be
barely
nine
month
since
he
be
with
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
six
,
you
mean
,
aunt
,
"
say
Kate
,
unadvisedly
.
  
<EOS>
"
only
nine
month
"
repeat
Mrs.
Greenow
,
as
though
she
have
not
hear
her
niece
.
"
<EOS>
only
nine
month
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
after
that
Kate
attempt
to
correct
no
more
such
error
.
<EOS>
"
It
happen
in
May
,
Miss
,
"
Jeannette
say
afterwards
to
Miss
Vavasor
,
"
and
that
,
as
we
reckon
,
it
will
be
just
a
twelvemonth
come
Christmas
.
"
<EOS>
but
Kate
pay
no
attention
to
this
.
  
<EOS>
and
Jeannette
be
very
ungrateful
,
and
certainly
should
have
indulge
herself
in
no
such
sarcasm
.
<EOS>
when
Mrs.
Greenow
make
a
slight
change
in
her
mourning
,
which
she
do
on
her
arrival
at
Norwich
,
use
a
little
lace
among
her
crape
,
Jeannette
reap
a
rich
harvest
in
gift
of
clothe
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
know
well
enough
that
she
expect
more
from
a
servant
than
mere
service
;
 
that
she
want
loyalty
,
discretion
,
and
perhaps
sometimes
a
little
secrecy
;
 
and
as
she
pay
for
these
thing
,
she
should
have
have
them
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
undertake
to
stay
a
month
with
her
aunt
at
Norwich
,
and
Mrs.
Greenow
undertake
that
Mr.
Cheesacre
should
declare
himself
as
Kate
's
lover
,
before
the
expiration
of
the
month
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
that
Kate
protest
that
she
want
no
such
lover
,
and
that
she
would
certainly
reject
him
if
he
come
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
very
well
,
my
dear
,
"
Aunt
Greenow
would
say
.
<EOS>
"
a
girl
must
settle
herself
some
day
,
you
know
;
 
and
you
would
have
it
all
your
own
way
at
Oileymead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
the
offer
certainly
show
much
generosity
on
the
part
of
Aunt
Greenow
,
inasmuch
as
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
attention
be
apparently
pay
to
herself
rather
than
to
her
niece
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
be
very
attentive
.
<EOS>
He
have
take
the
lodging
in
the
close
,
and
have
send
over
fowl
and
cream
from
Oileymead
,
and
have
call
on
the
morning
after
their
arrival
;
but
in
all
his
attention
he
distinguish
the
aunt
more
particularly
than
the
niece
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
all
for
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
Miss
,
"
say
Jeannette
once
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Captain
be
perhaps
the
nicerer
-
look
gentleman
,
and
he
be
not
so
podgy
like
;
but
what
be
good
look
if
a
gentleman
have
not
get
nothing
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
abide
anything
that
be
poor
;
neither
can
not
Missus
.
"
<EOS>
from
which
it
be
evident
that
Jeannette
give
Miss
Vavasor
no
credit
in
have
Mr.
Cheesacre
in
her
train
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
be
also
at
Norwich
,
have
obtain
some
quasi
-
military
employment
there
in
the
matter
of
drill
volunteer
.
<EOS>
certain
capacity
in
that
line
it
may
be
suppose
that
he
possess
,
and
,
as
his
friend
Cheesacre
say
of
him
,
he
be
go
to
earn
an
honest
penny
once
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
the
Captain
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
have
make
up
any
little
difference
that
have
exist
between
them
at
Yarmouth
,
and
be
close
ally
again
when
they
leave
that
place
.
<EOS>
some
little
compact
on
matter
of
business
must
have
be
arrange
between
them
,
 
for
the
Captain
<EOS>
be
in
fund
again
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
fund
again
through
the
liberality
of
his
friend
,
 
and
no
payment
of
former
loan
have
be
make
,
nor
have
there
be
any
speech
of
such
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
have
draw
his
purse
-
string
liberally
,
and
have
declare
that
if
all
go
well
the
hospitality
of
Oileymead
should
not
be
want
during
the
winter
.
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
have
nod
his
head
and
declare
that
all
should
go
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
see
much
of
the
Captain
,
I
suppose
,
"
say
Mr.
Cheesacre
to
Mrs.
Greenow
on
the
morning
of
the
day
after
her
arrival
at
Norwich
.
<EOS>
He
have
come
across
the
whole
way
from
Oileymead
to
ask
her
if
she
find
herself
comfortable
,
 
and
perhaps
with
an
eye
to
the
Norwich
market
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
He
now
wear
a
pair
of
black
riding
boot
over
his
trouser
,
and
a
round
top
hat
,
and
look
much
more
at
home
than
he
have
do
by
the
seaside
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
much
,
I
dare
say
,
"
say
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
tell
me
that
he
must
be
on
duty
ten
or
twelve
hour
a
day
.
<EOS>
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
deuced
good
thing
for
him
,
and
he
ought
to
be
very
much
oblige
to
me
for
put
him
in
the
way
of
get
it
.
<EOS>
but
he
tell
me
to
tell
you
that
if
he
do
not
call
,
you
be
not
to
be
angry
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
;
 
I
shall
remember
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
if
he
do
not
work
now
he
must
come
to
grief
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
get
a
shilling
that
he
can
call
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
not
he
really
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
a
shilling
,
Mrs.
Greenow
;
 
and
then
he
be
awfully
in
debt
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
bad
fellow
,
you
know
,
only
there
be
no
trust
him
for
anything
.
"
<EOS>
then
after
a
few
further
inquiry
that
be
almost
tender
,
and
a
promise
of
further
supply
from
the
dairy
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
take
his
leave
,
almost
forget
to
ask
after
Miss
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
he
leave
the
house
he
have
a
word
to
say
to
Jeannette
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
here
,
have
he
,
Jenny
?
"
<EOS>
"
We
have
not
see
a
sight
of
him
yet
,
sir
,
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
think
it
a
little
odd
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Cheesacre
give
the
girl
half
-
a
-
crown
,
and
go
his
way
.
<EOS>
Jeannette
,
I
think
,
must
have
forget
that
the
Captain
have
look
in
after
leave
his
military
duty
on
the
precede
evening
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
's
ten
or
twelve
hour
of
daily
work
be
perform
,
no
doubt
,
at
irregular
interval
,
 
some
day
late
and
some
day
early
,
 
for
he
may
be
see
about
Norwich
almost
at
all
time
,
during
the
early
part
of
that
November
;
 
and
he
may
be
very
often
see
go
into
the
close
.
<EOS>
in
Norwich
there
be
two
weekly
market
-
day
,
but
on
those
day
the
Captain
be
no
doubt
keep
more
entirely
to
his
military
employment
,
for
at
such
time
he
never
be
see
near
the
Close
.
<EOS>
now
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
visit
to
the
town
be
generally
make
on
market
-
day
,
and
so
it
happen
that
they
do
not
meet
.
<EOS>
on
such
occasion
Mr.
Cheesacre
always
be
drive
to
Mrs.
Greenow
's
door
in
a
cab
,
 
for
he
would
come
into
town
by
railway
,
 
and
he
would
deposit
a
basket
bear
the
rich
produce
of
his
dairy
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
that
Mrs.
Greenow
protest
against
these
gift
,
 
for
she
do
protest
and
declare
that
if
they
be
continue
,
they
would
be
send
back
.
<EOS>
They
be
,
however
,
continue
,
and
Mrs.
Greenow
be
at
her
wit
"
end
about
them
.
<EOS>
cheesacre
would
not
come
up
with
them
;
but
leave
them
,
would
go
about
his
business
,
and
would
return
to
see
the
lady
.
<EOS>
on
such
occasion
he
would
be
very
particular
in
get
his
basket
from
Jeannette
.
<EOS>
as
he
do
so
he
would
generally
ask
some
question
about
the
Captain
,
and
Jeannette
would
give
him
answer
confidentially
,
 
so
that
there
be
a
strong
friendship
between
these
two
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
I
to
do
about
it
?
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
,
as
Kate
come
into
the
sit
-
room
one
morning
,
and
see
on
the
table
a
small
hamper
line
with
a
clean
cloth
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
as
much
as
Jeannette
have
be
able
to
carry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
it
be
,
madam
,
 
quite
;
and
I
be
strong
in
the
arm
,
too
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
I
to
do
,
Kate
?
<EOS>
He
be
such
a
good
creature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
he
do
admire
you
both
so
much
,
"
say
Jeannette
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
do
not
want
to
offend
him
for
many
reason
,
"
say
the
aunt
,
look
knowingly
at
her
niece
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
anything
about
your
reason
,
aunt
,
but
if
I
be
you
,
I
should
leave
the
basket
just
as
it
be
till
he
come
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
you
mind
see
him
yourself
,
Kate
,
and
explain
to
him
that
it
will
not
do
to
get
on
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
would
not
mind
tell
him
that
if
he
will
promise
not
to
bring
any
more
,
you
will
not
object
to
take
this
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
indeed
,
aunt
,
I
can
not
do
that
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
bring
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Kate
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
nonsense
,
aunt
;
 
I
will
not
have
you
say
so
;
 
before
Jeannette
,
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
for
both
,
madam
;
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
and
there
certainly
be
not
any
cream
to
be
buy
like
it
in
Norwich
:
 
nor
yet
egg
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
there
be
in
the
basket
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
widow
lift
up
the
corner
of
the
cloth
.
<EOS>
"
I
declare
if
there
be
not
a
turkey

"
I

so
silly

<EOS>
on
the
present
occasion
Mrs.
Greenow
undertake
that
she
would
see
the
generous
gentleman
,
and
endeavour
to
stop
the
supply
from
his
farmyard
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
understand
that
he
would
call
about
four
o'clock
,
when
his
business
in
the
town
would
be
over
;
and
that
he
would
bring
with
him
a
little
boy
,
who
would
carry
away
the
basket
.
<EOS>
at
that
hour
Kate
of
course
be
absent
,
and
the
widow
receive
Mr.

alone
.
<EOS>
the
basket
and
cloth
be
there
,
in
the
sitting
-
room

and
on
the
table
be
lay

the
rich
thing
which
it
have
contain
;
 
the
turkey
poult
first
,
on
a
dish
provide
in
the
lodging
-
house
,
then
a
dozen
fresh
egg
in
a
soup
plate
,
then
the
cream
in
a
little
tin
can
,
which
,
for
the
last
fortnight
,
have
pass
regularly
between
Oileymead
and
the
house
in
the
Close
,
and
as
to
which
Mr.
Cheesacre
be
very
pointed
in
his
inquiry
with
Jeannette
.
<EOS>
then
behind
the
cream
there
be
two
or
three
head
of
broccoli
,
and
a
stick
of
celery
as
thick
as
a
man
's
wrist
.
<EOS>
altogether
the
tribute
be
a
very
comfortable
assistance
to
the
housekeeping
of
a
lady
live
in
a
small
way
in
lodging
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
when
he
see
the
array
on
the
long
sofa
-
table
,
know
that
he
be
to
prepare
himself
for
some
resistance
;
but
that
resistance
would
give
him
,
he
think
,
an
opportunity
of
say
a
few
word
that
he
be
desirous
of
speak
,
and
he
do
not
altogether
regret
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
just
call
in
,
"
he
say
,
"
to
see
how
you
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
not
likely
to
starve
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
,
point
to
the
delicacy
from
Oileymead
.
  
<EOS>
"
just
a
few
trifle
that
my
old
woman
ask
me
to
bring
in
,
"
say
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
She
insist
on
put
them
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
your
old
woman
be
by
far
too
magnificent
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
She
really
frighten
Kate
and
me
out
of
our
wit

"
  
Mr.
Cheesacre
have
no
wish
that
Miss
Vavasor
's
name
should
be
bring
into
play
upon
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
Mrs.

"
say
he
,
"
there
be
no

I

<EOS>

but
I

great
deal

I
can
assure

<EOS>
do
you

this
morning

<EOS>
when

will
be

liberal

their
liberality
must
be
repress
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
have
I
be
too
liberal
,
Mrs.
Greenow
?
<EOS>
what
be
a
young
turkey
and
a
stick
of
celery
when
a
man
be
willing
to
give
everything
that
he
have
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
get
a
great
deal
more
in
the
world
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
than
you
would
like
to
part
with
.
<EOS>
but
we
will
not
talk
of
that
,
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
when
shall
we
talk
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
really
have
anything
to
say
,
you
have
by
far
well
speak
to
Kate
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Greenow
,
you
mistake
me
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
you
mistake
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
just
at
this
moment
,
as
he
be
draw
close
to
the
widow
,
she
hear
,
or
fancy
that
she
hear
,
Jeannette
's
step
,
and
,
go
to

<EOS>
Jeannette
do

and
then

<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr.

"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
have
not

"
say
Mr.

.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
oblige
me
and
Kate
,
I
know

and
,
Jeannette
,
tell
Miss
Vavasor
that
I
be
ready
to
walk
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Cheesacre
know
that
he
could
not
say
those
few
word
on
that
occasion
;
and
as
the
hour
of
his
train
be
near
,
he
take
his
departure
,
and
go
out
of
the
Close
,
follow
by
the
little
boy
,
carry
the
basket
,
the
cloth
,
and
the
tin
can
.
   
<EOS>
which
Shall
It
be
?
 
<EOS>
the
next
day
be
Sunday
,
and
it
be
well
know
at
the
lodging
-
house
in
the
close
that
Mr.
Cheesacre
would
not
be
see
there
then
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
have
specially
warn
him
that
she
be
not
fond
of
Sunday
visitor
,
fear
that
otherwise
he
may
find
it
convenient
to
give
them
too
much
of
his
society
on
that
idle
day
.
<EOS>
in
the
morning
the
aunt
and
niece
both
go
to
the
Cathedral
,
and
then
at
three
o'clock
they
dine
.
<EOS>
but
on
this
occasion
they
do
not
dine
alone
.
<EOS>
Charlie
Fairstairs
,
who
,
with
her
family
,
have
come
home
from
Yarmouth
,
have
be
ask
to
join
them
;
and
in
order
that
Charlie
may
not
feel
it
dull
,
Mrs.
Greenow
have
,
with
her
usual
good
-
nature
,
invite
Captain
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
a
very
nice
little
dinner
they
have
.
<EOS>
the
captain
carve
the
turkey
,
give
due
honour
to
Mr.
Cheesacre
as
he
do
so
;
and
when
he
nibble
his
celery
with
his
cheese
,
he
be
prettily
jocose
about
the
richness
of
the
farmyard
at
Oileymead
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
the
most
generous
man
I
ever
meet
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
he
be
,
"
say
Captain
Bellfield
,
"
and
we
will
drink
his
health
.
<EOS>
poor
old
cheesy
!
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
pity
he
should
not
get
himself
a
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
any
man
more
calculated
to
make
a
young
woman
happy
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
"
say
Miss
Fairstairs
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
tell
that
his
house
and
all
about
it
be
quite
beautiful
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
especially
the
straw
-
yard
and
the
horse
-
pond
,
"
say
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
and
then
they
drink
the
health
of
their
absent
friend
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
arrange
that
the
lady
should
go
to
church
in
the
evening
,
and
it
be
think
that
Captain
Bellfield
would
,
perhaps
,
accompany
them
;
but
when
the
time
for
starting
come
,
Kate
and
Charlie
be
ready
,
but
the
widow
be
not
,
and
she
remain
,
 
in
order
,
as
she
afterwards
explain
to
Kate
,
that
Captain
Bellfield
may
not
seem
to
be
turn
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
have
make
no
offer
churchward
,
and
,
 
"
poor
man
,
"
as
Mrs.
Greenow
say
in
her
little
explanation
,
"
if
I
have
not
let
him
stay
there
,
he
would
have
have
no
rest
-
place
for
the
sole
of
his
foot
,
but
some
horrid
barrack
-
room
!
"
<EOS>
therefore
the
captain
be
allow
to
find
a
resting
-
place
in
Mrs.
Greenow
's
drawing
-
room
;
but
on
the
return
of
the
young
lady
from
church
,
he
be
not
there
,
and
the
widow
be
alone
,
"
look
back
,
"
she
say
,
"
to
thing
that
be
go
;
 
that
be
go
.
<EOS>
but
come
,
dear
<EOS>
,
I
be
not
go
to
make
you
melancholy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
they
have
tea
,
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
cream
be
use
with
liberality
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
have
not
allow
the
opportunity
to
slip
idly
from
his
hand
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
after
the
young
lady
have
go
,
he
say
little
or
nothing
,
but
sit
with
a
wine
-
glass
before
him
,
which
once
or
twice
he
fill
from
the
decanter
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
the
wine
be
not
very
good
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
but
one
can
not
get
good
wine
in
lodging
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
think
very
much
about
it
,
Mrs.
Greenow
;
that
be
the
truth
,
"
say
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
the
wine
be
very
good
of
its
kind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
there
be
another
period
of
silence
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
find
it
rather
dull
,
live
in
lodging
;
do
not
you
?
"
ask
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
quite
what
you
mean
by
dull
,
Captain
Bellfield
;
but
a
woman
circumstance
as
I
be
,
can
not
find
her
life
very
gay
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
full
twelvemonth
yet
since
I
lose
all
that
make
life
desirable
,
and
sometimes
I
wonder
at
myself
for
hold
up
as
well
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
wicked
to
give
way
to
grief
too
much
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
what
my
dear
Kate
always
say
to
me
,
and
I
be
sure
I
do
my
good
to
overcome
it
.
<EOS>
"
upon
this
soft
tear
trickle
down
her
cheek
,
show
in
their
course
that
she
at
any
rate
use
no
paint
in
produce
that
freshness
of
colour
which
be
one
of
her
great
charm
.
<EOS>
then
she
press
her
handkerchief
to
her
eye
,
and
remove
it
,
smile
faintly
on
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
intend
to
treat
you
to
such
a
scene
as
this

Captain
Bellfield

"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
on

Mrs.
Greenow

I
desire
so
much
,
as
permission
to
dry
those
tear

"
  
"
time
alone
can
do
that
,
Captain
Bellfield
;
 
time
alone
.
"
  
<EOS>

but
can
not
time
be
aid
by
love

friendship
and
affection
?

"
  
"
<EOS>
by
friendship
,
yes

<EOS>
what
would
life
be
worth
without
the
solace
of
friendship

<EOS>
"
  
"
and
how
much
well
be
the
warm
glow
of
love

"
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
,
as
he
ask
this
question
,
deliberately
get
up
,
and
move
his
chair
over
to
the
widow
's
side
.
<EOS>
but
the
widow
as
deliberately
change
her
position
to
the
corner
of
a
sofa

<EOS>
the
Captain
do
not

how

<EOS>
he
say
again
,
content
himself
with
look
into
her
face
with
all
his
eye

<EOS>
He
have
hope
that
he
would
have
be
able
to
press
her
hand
by
this
time

<EOS>

He

send
up
a

to

<EOS>
He
have
not
get
on

round
top
hat

and
as
he
do
wear
a
new

coat

have
his
left
hand
thrust
into
a
kid
glove

Jeannette
be

business
of
some
kind

<EOS>
with
new
boot

creak
loudly
,
he
walk
up
into

there
he

<EOS>
"

It

good
of

as
for
that
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
do
not
see
why
you

scruple
about

that
will
be
over

to
this
the
widow
make
no

she
look
very
sweetly
on
him
as
she
bid
him
sit
down

<EOS>
He
do
sit
down
;

first
he
put
his
hat
and
stick
carefully
away
in
one
corner

then
he
pull
off
his
glove
 
somewhat
laboriously

warm

He

clearly
prepared

there
come
from
his
lock
an
ambrosial
perfume

of
marrow

oil

and
there
be
a
fix
propriety
of
position
of
every
hair
of
his
whisker

which
indicate
very
plainly
that
he
have
be
at
a
hairdresser
's
shop

he
leave

market

nor
do
I
believe
that
he
have
wear
that
coat
when
he
come
to

door
earlier
in
the
morning

if
I
be

you
ever
see
in
your
life
,
 
just
like
one
that
the
lady
of
the
Lord
Lieutenant
drive
about
in
always
.
<EOS>
that
be
what
you
must
say
.
<EOS>
come
,
Mrs.
Greenow
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
you
do
not
know
what
it
be
to
have
bury
the
pride
of
your
youth
hardly
yet
twelve
month
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
have
bury
him
,
and
there
let
there
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
Your
sit
here
all
alone
,
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
,
will
not
bring
him
back
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
for
him
;
I
be
indeed
.
<EOS>
poor
Greenow
!
<EOS>
but
what
more
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
do
more
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
I
can
mourn
for
him
in
solitude
and
in
silence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
no
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of
it
,
 
break
your
heart
for
nothing
,
 
and
my
heart
too
.
<EOS>
You
never
think
of
that
.
"
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
speak
in
a
tone
that
be
full
of
reproach
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
but
it
can
be
.
<EOS>
come
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
We
understand
each
other
well
enough
now
,
surely
.
<EOS>
come
,
dear
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
approach
her
as
though
to
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
.
<EOS>
but
at
that
moment
there
come
a
knock
at
the
door
,
and
Jeannette
,
enter
the
room
,
tell
her
mistress
that
Captain
Bellfield
be
below
and
want
to
know
whether
he
could
see
her
for
a
minute
on
particular
business
.
  
<EOS>
"
show
Captain
Bellfield
up
,
certainly
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
D

Captain
Bellfield
!
"
say
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
   
<EOS>
Alice
be
teach
to
grow
Upwards
,
towards
the
light
.
 
<EOS>
before
the
day
come
on
which
Alice
be
to
go
to
Matching
Priory
,
she
have
often
regret
that
she
have
be
induce
to
make
the
promise
,
and
yet
she
have
as
often
resolve
that
there
be
no
possible
reason
why
she
should
not
go
to
Matching
Priory
.
<EOS>
but
she
fear
this
commencement
of
a
close
connection
with
her
great
relation
.
<EOS>
She
have
tell
herself
so
often
that
she
be
quite
separate
from
them
,
that
the
slight
accident
of
blood
in
no
way
tie
her
to
them
or
them
to
her
,
 
<EOS>
this
lesson
have
be
so
thoroughly
teach
to
her
by
the
injudicious
attempt
of
Lady
Macleod
to
teach
an
opposite
lesson
,
that
she
do
not
like
the
idea
of
put
aside
the
effect
of
that
teaching
.
<EOS>
and
perhaps
she
be
a
little
afraid
of
the
great
folk
whom
she
may
probably
meet
at
her
cousin
's
house
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
herself
she
have
like
,
 
and
have
love
too
with
that
momentary
love
which
certain
circumstance
of
our
life
will
sometimes
produce
,
a
love
which
be
strong
while
it
last
,
but
which
can
be
lay
down
when
the
need
of
it
be
pass
.
<EOS>
She
have
like
and
love
Lady
Glencora
,
and
have
in
no
degree
be
afraid
of
her
during
those
strange
visiting
in
Queen
Anne
Street
;
 
but
she
be
by
no
means
sure
that
she
should
like
Lady
Glencora
in
the
midst
of
her
grandeur
and
surround
by
the
pomp
of
her
rank
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
no
other
friend
or
acquaintance
in
that
house
,
and
fear
that
she
may
find
herself
desolate
,
cold
,
and
wound
in
her
pride
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
trick
into
the
visit
,
too
,
or
rather
have
trick
herself
into
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
sure
that
there
have
be
a
joint
scheme
between
her
cousin
and
Lady
Midlothian
,
and
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
repudiate
it
in
her
letter
to
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
but
there
have
be
no
such
scheme
;
she
have
wrong
Lady
Glencora
,
and
have
therefore
be
unable
to
resist
her
second
request
.
<EOS>
but
she
feel
unhappy
,
fear
that
she
would
be
out
of
her
element
,
and
more
than
once
half
make
up
her
mind
to
excuse
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Her
aunt
have
,
from
the
first
,
think
well
of
her
go
,
believe
that
it
may
probably
be
the
mean
of
reconcile
her
to
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
it
be
a
step
altogether
in
the
right
direction
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
would
,
if
she
live
,
become
a
Duchess
,
and
as
she
be
decidedly
Alice
's
cousin
,
of
course
Alice
should
go
to
her
house
when
invite
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
acknowledge
that
Lady
Macleod
be
not
selfish
in
her
worship
of
rank
.
<EOS>
She
have
play
out
her
game
in
life
,
and
there
be
no
probability
that
she
would
live
to
be
call
cousin
by
a
Duchess
of
omnium
.
<EOS>
She
bid
<EOS>
Alice
go
to
Matching
Priory
,
simply
because
she
love
her
niece
,
and
therefore
wish
her
to
live
in
the
good
and
most
eligible
way
within
her
reach
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
owe
it
as
a
duty
to
your
family
to
go
,
"
say
Lady
Macleod
.
  
<EOS>
what
further
correspondence
about
her
affair
have
pass
between
Lady
Macleod
and
Lady
Midlothian
Alice
never
know
.
<EOS>
She
steadily
refuse
all
entreaty
make
that
she
would
answer
the
Countess
's
letter
,
and
at
last
threaten
her
aunt
that
if
the
request
be
further
urge
she
would
answer
it
,
 
tell
Lady
Midlothian
that
she
have
be
very
impertinent
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
become
a
very
old
woman
,
Alice
,
"
the
poor
lady
say
,
piteously
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
suppose
I
have
well
not
interfere
any
further
.
<EOS>
whatever
I
have
say
I
have
always
mean
to
be
for
your
good
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
Alice
get
up
,
and
kiss
her
aunt
,
try
to
explain
to
her
that
she
resent
no
interference
from
her
,
and
feel
grateful
for
all
that
she
both
say
and
do
;
but
that
she
could
not
endure
meddle
from
people
whom
she
do
not
know
,
and
who
think
themselves
entitled
to
meddle
by
their
rank
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
because
they
be
cousin
as
well
,
"
say
Lady
Macleod
,
in
a
softly
sad
,
apologetic
voice
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
leave
Cheltenham
about
the
middle
of
November
on
her
road
to
Matching
Priory
.
<EOS>
She
be
to
sleep
in
London
one
night
,
and
go
down
to
match
in
Yorkshire
with
her
maid
on
the
follow
day
.
<EOS>
Her
father
undertake
to
meet
her
at
the
Great
Western
Station
,
and
to
take
her
on
the
following
morning
to
the
Great
Northern
.
<EOS>
He
say
nothing
in
his
letter
about
dining
with
her
,
but
when
he
meet
her
,
mutter
something
about
an
engagement
,
and
take
her
home
graciously
promise
that
he
would
breakfast
with
her
on
the
following
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
you
be
go
,
Alice
,
"
he
say
when
they
be
in
the
cab
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
papa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
?
 
<EOS>
because
I
think
it
be
the
proper
thing
to
do
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
have
never
say
much
to
you
about
these
people
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
connect
with
me
,
and
I
know
that
they
hate
the
name
of
Vavasor
;
 
not
but
what
the
name
be
a
deal
old
than
any
of
theirs
,
and
the
family
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
therefore
I
do
not
understand
why
you
think
I
be
specially
right
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
to
say
I
be
specially
wrong
,
I
should
be
less
surprised
,
and
of
course
I
should
not
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
go
by
all
mean
.
<EOS>
rank
and
wealth
be
advantage
,
let
anybody
say
what
they
will
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
why
else
do
everybody
want
to
get
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
shall
not
get
them
by
go
to
Matching
Priory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
get
part
of
their
value
.
<EOS>
take
them
as
a
whole
,
the
nobility
of
England
be
pleasant
acquaintance
to
have
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
run
after
them
very
much
myself
,
though
I
marry
,
as
I
may
say
,
among
them
.
<EOS>
that
very
thing
rather
stand
in
my
way
than
otherwise
.
<EOS>
but
you
may
be
sure
of
this
,
that
man
and
woman
ought
to
grow
,
like
plant
,
upwards
.
<EOS>
everybody
should
endeavour
to
stand
as
well
as
he
can
in
the
world
,
and
if
I
have
a
choice
of
acquaintance
between
a
sugar
-
baker
and
a
peer
,
I
should
prefer
the
peer
,
 
unless
,
indeed
,
the
sugar
-
baker
have
something
very
strong
on
his
side
to
offer
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
call
that
tuft
-
hunt
,
and
it
do
not
necessitate
toadying
.
<EOS>
It
be
simply
grow
up
,
towards
the
light
,
as
the
tree
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
listen
to
her
father
's
worldly
wisdom
with
a
smile
,
but
she
do
not
attempt
to
answer
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
seldom
,
indeed
,
that
he
take
upon
himself
the
labour
of
lecture
her
,
or
that
he
give
her
even
as
much
counsel
as
he
have
give
now
.
"
<EOS>
well
,
papa
,
I
hope
I
shall
find
myself
grow
towards
the
light
,
"
she
say
as
she
get
out
of
the
cab
.
<EOS>
then
he
have
not
enter
the
house
,
but
have
take
the
cab
on
with
him
to
his
club
.
  
<EOS>
on
her
table
Alice
find
a
note
from
her
cousin
George
.
<EOS>
"
I
hear
you
be
go
down
to
the
Pallisers
at
Matching
Priory
to
-
morrow
,
and
as
I
shall
be
glad
to
say
one
word
to
you
<EOS>
before
you
go
,
will
you
let
me
see
you
this
evening
,
 
say
at
nine
?
 
<EOS>
G.
V.
<EOS>
"
She
feel
immediately
that
she
could
not
help
see
him
,
but
she
greatly
regret
the
necessity
.
<EOS>
She
wish
that
she
have
go
directly
from
Cheltenham
to
the
North
,
 
regardless
even
of
those
change
of
wardrobe
which
her
purposed
visit
require
.
<EOS>
then
she
set
herself
to
consider
.
<EOS>
how
have
George
hear
of
her
visit
to
the
Priory
,
and
how
have
he
learn
the
precise
evening
which
she
would
pass
in
London
?
<EOS>
why
should
he
be
so
intent
on
watch
all
her
movement
as
it
seem
that
he
be
?
<EOS>
as
to
see
him
she
have
no
alternative
,
so
she
complete
her
arrangement
for
her
journey
before
nine
,
and
then
await
him
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
you
be
go
to
Matching
Priory
,
"
be
the
first
word
he
say
.
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
may
have
teach
her
to
grow
towards
the
light
,
if
she
have
ask
him
for
his
reason
;
 
but
this
she
do
not
do
just
then
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
learn
that
I
be
go
?
<EOS>
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
it
from
a
friend
of
mine

<EOS>
well
;
 
from
Burgo
Fitzgerald

you
must
know

"
<EOS>
from
Mr.
Fitzgerald
?
<EOS>
"
say
Alice
,
in
profound
astonishment
:
"
how
could
Mr.
Fitzgerald
have
hear
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
more
than
I
know
,
Alice

not
directly
from
Lady
Glencora

I
should
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
that
would
be
impossible
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
quite
so
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
keep
up
her
intimacy
with
Burgo
's
sister
,
and
perhaps
it
get
round
to
him
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
he
tell
you
also
that
I
be
go
to

morrow

<EOS>
He
must
have
know
all
about
it
very
accurately
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
then
I
ask
Kate
,
and
Kate
tell
me
when
you
be
go
.
<EOS>
yes
;
I
know
.
<EOS>
Kate
have
be
wrong
,
have
not
she
?
<EOS>
Kate
be
caution
,
no
doubt
,
to
say
nothing
about
your
coming
and
going
to
so
inconsiderable
a
person
as
myself
.
<EOS>
but
you
must
not
be
down
upon
Kate
.
<EOS>
She
never
mention
it
till
I
show
by
my
question
to
her
that
I
know
all
about
your
journey
to
Matching
.
<EOS>
I
own
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
why
it
should
be
necessary
to
keep
me
so
much
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
feel
that
she
be
blush
.
<EOS>
the
caution
have
be
give
to
Kate
because
Kate
still
transgress
in
her
letter
,
by
say
little
word
about
her
brother
.
<EOS>
and
Alice
do
not
even
now
believe
Kate
to
have
be
false
to
her
;
but
she
see
that
she
herself
have
be
imprudent
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
understand
it
,

continue
George
,
speak
without
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
be
but
the
other
day
that
we
be
such
dear
friend

<EOS>
do
you
remember
the
balcony
at
Basle
?
<EOS>
and
now
it
seem
that
we
be
quite
estranged

nay
,
bad
than
estranged
;
that
I
be
,
as
it

under
some
ban

<EOS>
have
I
do
anything

nothing

boldly

Alice
sit
silent

not

what
to

charge
bring

that

allow
his
question
to
pass
without
an
answer

<EOS>
but
Vavasor
be
not
so
complaisant
.
<EOS>
"
if
there
be
any
reason
,
Alice
,
I
think
that
I
have
a
right
to
ask
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
for
a
few
second
she
do
not
speak
a
word
,
but
sit
consider
.
<EOS>
He
also
remain
silent
with
his
eye
fix
upon
her
.
<EOS>
She
look
at
him
and
see
nothing
but
his
scar
,
 
nothing
but
his
scar
and
the
brightness
of
his
eye
,
which
be
almost
fierce
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
he
be
in
earnest
,
and
therefore
resolve
that
she
would
be
in
earnest
also
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
you
have
such
a
right
,
"
she
say
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
let
me
exercise
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
you
have
such
a
right
,
but
I
think
also
that
you
be
ungenerous
to
exercise
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
understand
that
.
<EOS>
by
heaven
,
Alice
,
I
can
not
be
leave
in
this
suspense
!
<EOS>
if
I
have
do
anything
to
offend
you
,
perhaps
I
can
remove
the
offence
by
apology
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
do
nothing
to
offend
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
or
if
there
be
any
cause
why
our
friendship
should
be
drop
,
 
why
we
should
be
on
a
different
footing
to
each
other
in
London
than
we
be
in
Switzerland
<EOS>
,
I
may
acknowledge
it
,
if
it
be
explain
to
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
put
up
with
the
doubt
,
when
I
be
tell
that
I
have
a
right
to
demand
its
solution
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
be
frank
with
you

George

my
being
so
will

as
you
may
guess
,
be
very
painful
.

<EOS>
She
pause
again
,
look
at
him
to
see
if
yet
he
would
spare
her
;
but
he
be
all
scar
and
eye
as
before
,
and
there
be
no
mercy
in
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
sister
,
George

have
think
that
my
parting
with
Mr.
Grey
may
lead
to
a
renewal
of
a
purpose
of
marriage
between
you
and
me
.
<EOS>
You
know
her
eagerness
,

will
understand
that
it
may
have
be
necessary
that
I
should
require
silence
from
her
on
that
head

You
ought

understand
it
all

I
then
be
be
punish
for
her
sin

he
say
;

suddenly
the
scar
on
his
face
be
heal
up
again
,

there
be
something
of
the
old
pleasantness
in
his
eye

<EOS>

I
have
say
nothing

sin

find

after

short
pause

You

honest

extend
his

yes

certainly

speak
doubtingly

indecision

no

daily

this
other
subject

this
visit
to
matching

surely
I
may
speak
of
that

there
be
something
now
in
his
voice
so
bright

feel
the
influence
of
it

answer
him
cheerfully

with

yes

with
Mr.

You
must
read
all
the

oh
,
George

"
  
<EOS>

I
be
quite
in

<EOS>
that
is
,
not
in
earnest
about
the
blue
book
,
as
you
would
not
have
time
;

about
Mr.
Palliser

<EOS>
He
will
be
the
new
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
without
a
doubt

"
Will
he
indeed
?
<EOS>
but
why
should
I
make
a
bosom
friend
of
the
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer

<EOS>
I
do
not
want
any
public
money

I
do

my

do
not
you
see

<EOS>

no

I
do

I
be
sure
I
hope
you
will
.

"

and
if
I
do
,
of
course
it
will
be
my
game
to
support
the
ministry

rather
the
new
ministry
;
for
of
course
there
will
be
change
.

I
hope

not

I

may
be
change
altogether

"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
that
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
well
as
a
dream
;

there
be
no
such
man
as
you
want
to
see
,
 
man
really
from
the
people
,
 
strong
enough
to
take
high
office
.
<EOS>
a
man
can
not
drive
four
horse
because
he
be
a
philanthropist
,
 
or
rather
a
philhorseophist
,
and
be
desirous
that
the
team
should
be
drive
without
any
hurt
to
them
.
<EOS>
a
man
can
not
govern
well
,
simply
because
he
be
genuinely
anxious
that
man
should
be
well
govern
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
will
there
never
be
any
such
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
say
that
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mind
confess
to
you
that
it
be
my
ambition
to
be
such
a
one
myself
.
<EOS>
but
a
child
must
crawl
before
he
can
walk
.
<EOS>
such
a
one
as
I
,
hope
to
do
something
in
politic
,
must
spare
no
chance
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
something
to
me
that
Mr.
Palliser
should
become
the
friend
of
any
dear
friend
of
mine

of
a
dear
friend
bear
the

name

<EOS>

I
be
afraid

George

you
will
find
me
a
bad
hand
at

They
say
he
be
lead
immensely
by
his

be
very
clever

this

Alice

worthless

do
you

in
answer
to
which
Alice
shake
her
head
;

,
nevertheless
,
she
feel
in
some
way
pleased

flattered

<EOS>
George
leave
her
without

a
word
more
about
her
marriage
prospect
past

go
to

glad

Dandy
and
Flirt

<EOS>
Alice
reach
the
Matching
Road
Station
about
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
without
adventure
,
and
immediately
on
the
stopping
of
the
train
become
aware
that
all
trouble
be
off
her
own
hand
.
<EOS>
a
servant
in
livery
come
to
the
open
window
,
and
touch
his
hat
to
her
,
inquire
if
she
be
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
then
her
dressing
-
bag
and
shawl
and
cloak
be
take
from
her
,
and
she
be
convey
through
the
station
by
the
station
-
master
on
one
side
of
her
,
the
footman
on
the
other
,
and
by
the
railway
porter
behind
.
<EOS>
She
instantly
perceive
that
she
have
become
possessed
of
great
privilege
by
belong
even
for
a
time
to
Matching
Priory
,
and
that
she
be
essentially
grow
upwards
towards
the
light
.
  
<EOS>
outside
,
on
the
broad
drive
before
the
little
station
,
she
see
an
omnibus
that
be
go
to
the
small
town
of
Matching
,
intend
for
people
who
have
not
grow
upwards
as
have
be
her
lot
;
and
she
see
also
a
light
stylish
-
look
cart
which
she
would
have
call
a
Whitechapel
<EOS>
have
she
be
properly
instruct
in
such
matter
,
and
a
little
low
open
carriage
with
two
beautiful
small
horse
,
in
which
be
sit
a
lady
envelop
in
fur
.
<EOS>
of
course
this
be
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
another
servant
be
stand
on
the
ground
,
hold
the
horse
of
the
carriage

the
cart

"
dear
Alice
,
I
be
so
glad
you
have
come

a
voice
from
the
fur
.
<EOS>
"
look
here
,
dear
;
your
maid
can
go
in
the
dog
-
cart
with
your
thing
,

it
be
not
a
dog
-
cart
,
but
Lady
Glencora
know
no
better
;

she
will
be
quite
comfortable
there
;

do
you
get
in
here

you
very
cold

oh
,
no

not
cold
at
all

it
be
awfully
cold

You
have
be
in
the
stuffy
carriage
,

you
will
find
it
cold
enough
out
here

I
can
tell
you
.

"
oh
!
Lady
Glencora
,
I
be
so
sorry
that
I
have
bring
you
out
on
such
a
morning

say
Alice
,
get
in
and
take
the
place

assign
her
next
to
the
charioteer

"
what
nonsense
!
<EOS>
sorry
!

why
I
have
look
forward
to
meet
you
all
alone

ever
since
I
know
you
be
come

<EOS>
if
it
have
snow
all
the
morning
I
should
have
come
just
the
same
.
<EOS>
I
drive
out
almost
every
day
when
I
be
down
here
,
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
when
the
house
be
not
too
crowded
,
or
I
can
make
an
excuse
.
<EOS>
wrap
these
thing
over
you
;
there
be
plenty
of
them
.
<EOS>
You
shall
drive
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
however
,
decline
the
driving
,
express
her
gratitude
in
what
prettiest
word
she
could
find
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
drive
better
than
anything
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
do
not
like
lady
to
hunt
,
and
of
course
it
would
not
do
as
he
do
not
hunt
himself
.
<EOS>
I
do
ride
,
but
he
never
get
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
I
almost
fancy
I
should
like
to
drive
four
-
in
-
hand
,
 
<EOS>
only
I
know
I
should
be
afraid
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
It
would
look
very
terrible
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
would
not
it
?
<EOS>
the
look
would
be
the
bad
of
it
;
as
it
be
all
the
world
over
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
wish
there
be
no
such
thing
as
look
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
anything
improper
,
you
know
;
only
one
do
get
so
hamper
,
right
and
leave
,
for
fear
of
Mrs.
Grundy
.
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
go
straight
,
and
get
along
pretty
well
on
the
whole
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
Baker
,
you
must
put
Dandy
in
the
bar
;
he
pull
so
,
go
home
,
that
I
can
not
hold
him
in
the
check

<EOS>
She
stop
the
horse
,
and
Baker
,
a
very
completely
-
get
-
up
groom
of
some
forty
year
of
age
,
who
sit
behind
,
get
down
and
put
the
impetuous
Dandy
"
in
the
bar

thereby
change
the
rein
,
so
that
the
curb
be
bring
to
bear
on
him

Flirt

continue
Lady
Glencora

speak
to

<EOS>
be
not
they
a
beautiful
match
?
<EOS>
the
Duke

them
to
me

them
himself

do
you
ever

never

He
will
not
be
here
before
Christmas

you
shall
be
introduce
some
day
in
London

He
be
an
excellent
creature

I
be
a
great
pet
of
his
;
though
,
after
all
,
I
never
speak
half
a
dozen
word
to
him
when
I
see
him

He
be
one
of
those
people

never
talk

I
be
one
of
those
who
like
talk

as
you
will
find
out

think
it
run
in
family

the
Pallisers
be
non
-
talker

<EOS>
that
do
not
mean
that
they
be
not
speaker
,
for
Mr.
Palliser
have
plenty
to
say
in
the
House
,
and
they
declare
that
he
be
one
of
the
few
public
man
who
have
get
lung
enough
to
make
a
financial
statement
without
break
down

"
  
<EOS>
Alice
be
aware
that
she
have
as
yet
hardly
speak
herself
,
and
begin
to
bethink
herself
that
she
do
not
know
what
to
say
.
<EOS>
have
Lady
Glencora
pause
on
the
subject
of
Dandy
and
Flirt
,
she
may
have
manage
to
be
enthusiastic
about
the
horse
,
but
she
could
not
discuss
freely
the
general
silence
of
the
Palliser
family
,
nor
the
excellent
lung
,
as
regard
public
purpose
,
of
the
one
who
be
the
husband
of
her
present
friend
.
<EOS>
so
she
ask
how

it

Matching
Priory

"
You

me
already

I

Glencora

I
do
not

that
,
"
say
Alice

<EOS>
"
I
delight
in
the
drive

<EOS>
but
somehow
one
expect
Matching
Station
to
be
near
Matching
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
yes
;
that
be
a
great
cheat
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
Matching
Station
at
all
but
Matching
Road
Station
,
and
it
be
eight
mile
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
bore
,
for
though
the
omnibus
bring
our
parcel
,
we
have
to
be
constantly
send
over
,
and
it
be
very
expensive
,
I
can
assure
you
.
<EOS>
I
want
Mr.
Palliser
to
have
a
branch
,
but
he
say
he
would
have
to
take
all
the
share
himself
,
and
that
would
cost
more
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
be
there
a
town
at
Matching
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
a
little
bit
of
a
place
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
round
by
it
if
you
like
,
and
in
at
the
further
gate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
!
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
but
I
should
like
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
borough
once
,
and
belong
to
the
Duke
;
but
they
put
it
out
at
the
Reform
Bill
.
<EOS>
They
make
some
kind
of
bargain
;
 
he
be
to
keep
either
Silverbridge
or
Matching
,
but
not
both
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
sit
for
Silverbridge
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
choose
Silverbridge
,
 
or
rather
his
father
do
,
as
he
be
then
go
to
build
his
great
place
in
Barsetshire
;
 
that
be
near
Silverbridge
.
<EOS>
but
the
Matching
people
have
not
forgive
him
yet
.
<EOS>
He
be
sit
for
match
himself
when
the
Reform
Bill
pass
.
<EOS>
then
his
father
die
,
and
he
have
not
live
there
much
since
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
deal
nice
place
than
Gatherum
Castle
,
only
not
half
so
grand
.
<EOS>
I
hate
grandeur
;
do
not
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
try
much
of
it

you
have

come
now

that
be
not
fair

you

I

under

<EOS>

I

all
about

such
terrible

down
in
Scotland

I
have
hear
of
him
before

"
<EOS>
these
last
word
Lady
Glencora
speak
in
a
low
voice
and
in
an
altered
tone
,
 
slowly
,
as
though
she
be
think
of
something
that
pain
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
from
Burgo
Fitzgerald
that
she
have
hear
of
George
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
do
not
know
what
to
say
.
<EOS>
She
find
it
impossible
to
discuss
all
the
most
secret
and
deep
of
her
feeling
out
in
that
open
carriage
,
perhaps
in
the
hearing
of
the
servant
behind
,
on
this
her
first
meeting
with
her
cousin
,
 
of
whom
,
in
fact
,
she
know
very
little
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
intend
to
discuss
these
thing
at
all
,
and
certainly
not
in
such
a
manner
as
this
.
<EOS>
so
she
remain
silent
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
beginning
of
the
park
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
point
to
a
grand
old
ruin
of
an
oak
tree
,
which
stand
on
the
wide
margin
of
the
road
,
outside
the
rounded
corner
of
the
park
paling
,
prop
up
with
a
skeleton
of
support
stick
all
round
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
that
be
match
oak
,
under
which
Coeur
de
Lion
or
Edward
the
Third
<EOS>
,
I
forget
which
,
be
meet
by
Sir
Guy
de
Palisere
as
he
come
from
the
war
,
or
from
hunting
,
or
something
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
king
,
you
know
,
who
have
be
fight
or
whatever
it
be
,
and
Sir
Guy
entertain
him
when
he
be
very
tired
.
<EOS>
Jeffrey
Palliser
,
who
be
my
husband
's
cousin
,
say
that
old
Sir
Guy
luckily
pull
out
his
brandy
-
flask
.
<EOS>
but
the
king
immediately
give
him
all
the
land
of
Matching
,
 
only
there
be
a
priory
then
and
a
lot
of
monk
,
and
I
do
not
quite
understand
how
that
be
.
<EOS>
but
I
know
one
of
the
young
brother
always
use
to
be
abbot
and
sit
in
the
House
of
Lords
.
<EOS>
and
the
king
give
him
Littlebury
at
the
same
time
,
which
be
about
seven
mile
away
from
here
.
<EOS>
as
Jeffrey
Palliser
say
,
it
be
a
great
deal
of
money
for
a
pull
at
his
flask
.
<EOS>
Jeffrey
Palliser
be
here
now
,
and
I
hope
you
will
like
him
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
no
child
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
be
not
to
marry
again
,
Jeffrey
would
be
the
heir
.
"
<EOS>
and
here
again
her
voice
be
low
and
slow
,
and
altogether
change
in
its
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
that
be
the
way
most
of
the
old
family
get
their
estate
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
either
so
,
or
by
robbery
.
<EOS>
many
of
them
be
terrible
thief
,
my
dear
,
and
I
dare
say
Sir
Guy
be
no
well
than
he
should
be
.
<EOS>
but
since
that
they
have
always
call
some
of
the
Pallisers
Plantagenet
.
<EOS>
My
husband
's
name
be
Plantagenet

<EOS>
the
Duke
be
call
George
Plantagenet
,
and
the
king
be
his
godfather
.
<EOS>
the
queen
be
my
godmother
,
I
believe
,
but
I
do
not
know
that
I
be
much
the
well
for
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
use
in
godfather
and
godmother
;
 
do
you
think
there
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
much
as
it
be
manage
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
have
a
child
,
 
oh
,
Alice

it
be
a
dreadful
thing
not
to
have
a
child
when
so
much
depend
on
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
be
such
a
short
time
marry
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
well
;
I
can
see
it
in
his
eye
when
he
ask
me
question
;
but
I
do
not
think
he
would
say
an
unkind
word
,
not
if
his
own
position
depend
on
it
.
<EOS>
ah
,
well
;
this
be
Matching
.
<EOS>
that
other
gate
we
pass
,
where
Dandy
want
to
turn
in
,
 
<EOS>
that
be
where
we
usually
go
up
,
but
I
have
bring
you
round
to
show
you
the
town
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
inn
,
 
whoever
can
possibly
come
to
stay
there
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
;
I
never
see
anybody
go
in
or
out
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
baker
who
bake
our
bread
,
 
we
bake
it
at
the
house
at
first
,
but
nobody
could
eat
it
;
and
I
know
that
that
man
there
mend
Mr.
Palliser
's
shoe
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
particular
about
his
shoe
.
<EOS>
We
shall
see
the
church
as
we
go
in
at
the
other
gate
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
park
,
and
be
very
pretty
,
 
but
not
half
so
pretty
as
the
priory
ruin
close
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
the
ruin
be
our
great
lion
.
<EOS>
I
do
so
love
to
wander
about
them
at
moonlight
.
<EOS>
I
often
think
of
you
when
I
do
;
I
do
not
know
why
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
know
why
,
and
I
will
tell
you
some
day
.
<EOS>
come
,
Miss
Flirt
!
"
  
<EOS>
as
they
drive
up
through
the
park
,
Lady
Glencora
point
out
first
the
church
<EOS>
and
then
the
ruin
,
through
the
midst
of
which
the
road
run
,
<EOS>
and
then
they
be
at
once
before
the
front
door
.
<EOS>
the
corner
of
the
modern
house
come
within
two
hundred
yard
of
the
gateway
of
the
old
priory
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
large
building
,
very
pretty
,
with
two
long
front
;
but
it
be
no
more
than
a
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
palace
,
nor
a
castle
,
nor
be
it
hardly
to
be
call
a
mansion
.
<EOS>
It
be
build
with
gable
roof
,
four
of
which
form
the
side
from
which
the
window
of
the
drawing
-
room
open
out
upon
a
lawn
which
separate
the
house
from
the
old
ruin
,
and
which
indeed
surround
the
ruin
,
and
go
inside
them
,
form
the
present
flooring
of
the
old
chapel
,
and
the
old
refectory
,
and
the
old
cloister
.
<EOS>
much
of
the
cloister
indeed
be
stand
,
and
there
the
stone
pavement
remain
;
but
the
square
of
the
cloister
be
all
turfed
,
and
in
the
middle
of
it
stand
a
large
modern
stone
vase
,
out
of
the
broad
basin
of
which
hang
flower
creeper
and
green
tendril
.
  
<EOS>
as
Lady
Glencora
drive
up
to
the
door
,
a
gentleman
,
who
have
hear
the
sound
of
the
wheel
,
come
forth
to
meet
them
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
Mr.
Palliser

say
she
;
"
that
show
that
you
be
an
honoured
guest
,
for
you
may
be
sure
that
he
be
hard
at
work

would
not

come
out
for
anybody
else

here
be
Miss
Vavasor

Alice

my
husband

"
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Palliser
put
forth
his
hand
and
help
her
out
of
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
have
not
find
it
very
cold
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
winter
have
come
upon
us
quite
suddenly
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
say
nothing
more
to
her
than
this
,
till
he
meet
her
again
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
tall
thin
man
,
apparently
not
more
than
thirty
year
of
age
,
look
in
all
respect
like
a
gentleman
,
but
with
nothing
in
his
appearance
that
be
remarkable
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
face
that
you
may
see
and
forget
,
and
see
again
and
forget
again
;
and
yet
when
you
look
at
it
and
pull
it
to
piece
,
you
find
that
it
be
a
fairly
good
face
,
show
intellect
in
the
forehead
,
and
much
character
in
the
mouth
.
<EOS>
the
eye
too
,
though
not
to
be
call
bright
,
have
always
something
to
say
for
themselves
,
look
as
though
they
have
a
real
meaning
.
<EOS>
but
the
outline
of
the
face
be
almost
insignificant
,
be
too
thin
;
and
he
wear
no
beard
to
give
it
character
.
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
Mr.
Palliser
be
a
man
who
have
never
think
of
assist
his
position
in
the
world
by
his
outward
appearance
.
<EOS>
not
to
be
look
at
,
but
to
be
read
about
in
the
newspaper
,
be
his
ambition
.
<EOS>
man
say
that
he
be
to
be
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
and
no
one
thought
of
suggest
that
the
insignificance
of
his
face
would
stand
in
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
the
people
all
out
?
"
<EOS>
his
wife
ask
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
man
have
not
come
in
from
shooting
;
 
at
least
I
think
not
;
 
and
some
of
the
lady
be
drive
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
not
see
anybody
since
you
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
have
not
.
<EOS>
He
never
have
time
,
Alice
,
to
see
any
one
.
<EOS>
but
we
will
go
up
-
stair
,
dear
.
<EOS>
I
tell
them
to
let
us
have
tea
in
my
dressing
-
room
,
as
I
think
you
would
like
that
well
than
go
into
the
drawing
-
room
before
you
have
take
off
your
thing
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
famish
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
then
you
can
come
down
,
or
if
you
want
to
avoid
two
dressing
you
can
sit
over
the
fire
up

stair
till
dinner

time

<EOS>
so
say
she
skip
up

stair
and
Alice
follow
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
be
my
dressing

here

your
room
all

opposite

<EOS>
You
look
out
into
the
park

<EOS>
It
be
pretty
,
be
not
it
?
<EOS>
but
come
into
my
dressing
-
room
,
and
see
the
ruin
out
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
follow
Lady
Glencora
across
the
passage
into
what
she
call
her
dressing
-
room
,
and
there
find
herself
surround
by
an
infinitude
of
feminine
luxury
.
<EOS>
the
prettiest
of
table
be
there
;
 
the
easy
of
chair
;
 
the
most
costly
of
cabinet
;
 
the
quaintest
of
old
china
ornament
.
<EOS>
It
be
bright
with
the
gay
colour
,
 
make
pleasant
to
the
eye
with
the
binding
of
many
book
,
have
nymph
paint
on
the
ceiling
and
little
Cupids
on
the
door

<EOS>
"
be
not
it
pretty
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
turn
quickly
on
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
I
call
it
my
dressing
-
room
because
in
that
way
I
can
keep
people
out
of
it

but
I
have
my
brush
and
soap
in
a
little
closet
there
,
and
my
clothe

my
clothe

everywhere

I

there

We
dine
at
eight

"
  
<EOS>
Alice
decide
that
she
would
stay
in
her
own
room
till
dinner
time
,
and
be
take
there
by
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
She
find
her
maid
unpack
her
clothe
,
and
for
a
while
employ
herself
in
assist
at
the
work
;
but
that
be
soon
do
,
and
then
she
be
leave
alone
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
feel
so
strange
,
madam
,
among
all
those
people
down

stair
,
"
say
the
girl
.
<EOS>
"
They
all
seem
to
look
at

I

You
will
get
over

soon

Jane

<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
shall
;

you
see
,
they
be
all
like
know
each
other
,
miss

"
  
<EOS>
Alice
,
when
she
sit
down
alone
,
feel
herself
to
be
very
much
in
the
same
condition
as
her
maid
.
<EOS>
what
would
the
Duchess
of
St.
Bungay
or
Mr.
Jeffrey
Palliser
,
 
who
himself
may
live
to
be
a
duke
if
thing
go
well
for
him
,
 
care
for
her
?
<EOS>
as
to
Mr.
Palliser
,
the
master
of
the
house
,
it
be
already
evident
to
her
that
he
would
not
put
himself
out
of
his
way
for
her
.
<EOS>
have
she
not
do
wrong
to
come
there
?
<EOS>
if
it
be
possible
for
her
to
fly
away
,
back
to
the
dullness
of
Queen
Anne
Street
,
or
even
to
the
preaching
of
Lady
Macleod
,
would
she
not
do
so
immediately
?
<EOS>
what
business
have
she
<EOS>
,
 
she
ask
herself
,
 
to
come
to
such
a
house
as
that
?
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
be
very
kind
to
her
,
but
frighten
her
even
by
her
kindness
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
she
be
aware
that
Lady
Glencora
could
not
devote
herself
especially
to
any
such
guest
as
she
be
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
must
of
course
look
after
her
duchess
,
and
do
pretty
,
as
she
call
it
,
to
her
husband
's
important
political
alliance
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
she
begin
to
think
about
Lady
Glencora
herself
.
<EOS>
what
a
strange
,
weird
nature
she
be
,
 
with
her
round
blue
eye
and
wavy
hair
,
look
sometimes
like
a
child
and
sometimes
almost
like
an
old
woman
!
<EOS>
and
how
she
talk
!
<EOS>
what
thing
she
say
,
and
what
terrible
foreboding
she
utter
of
strange
thing
that
she
mean
to
say
!
<EOS>
why
have
she
at
their
first
meeting
make
that
allusion
to
the
mode
of
her
own
betrothal
,
 
and
then
,
check
herself
for
speak
of
it
<EOS>
so
soon
,
almost
declare
that
she
mean
to
speak
more
of
it
hereafter
?
<EOS>
"
She
should
never
mention
it
to
any
one
,
"
say
Alice
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
if
her
lot
in
life
have
not
satisfy
her
,
there
be
so
much
the
more
reason
why
she
should
not
mention
it
.
"
<EOS>
then
Alice
protest
to
herself
that
no
father
,
no
aunt
,
no
Lady
Midlothian
should
persuade
her
into
a
marriage
of
which
she
fear
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Glencora
have
make
for
herself
excuse
which
be
not
altogether
untrue
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
very
young
,
and
have
be
terribly
weight
with
her
wealth
.
  
<EOS>
and
it
seem
to
Alice
that
her
cousin
have
tell
her
everything
in
that
hour
and
a
half
that
they
have
be
together
.
<EOS>
She
have
give
a
whole
history
of
her
husband
and
of
herself
.
<EOS>
She
have
say
how
indifferent
he
be
to
her
pleasure
,
and
how
vainly
she
strove
to
interest
herself
in
his
pursuit
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
as
yet
,
she
be
childless
and
without
prospect
of
a
child
,
when
,
as
she
herself
have
say
,
 
"
so
much
depend
on
it
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
strange
to
Alice
that
all
this
should
have
be
already
tell
to
her
.
<EOS>
and
why
should
Lady
Glencora
think
of
Alice
when
she
walk
out
among
the
priory
ruin
by
moonlight
?
  
<EOS>
the
two
hour
seem
to
her
very
long
,
 
as
though
she
be
pass
her
time
in
absolute
seclusion
at
Matching
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
do
not
dare
to
go
down
-
stair
.
<EOS>
but
at
last
her
maid
come
to
dress
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
get
on
below
,
Jane
?
"
<EOS>
her
mistress
ask
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
miss
,
they
be
uncommon
civil
,
and
I
do
not
think
after
all
it
will
be
so
bad
.
<EOS>
We
have
our
tea
very
comfortable
in
the
housekeeper
's
room
.
<EOS>
there
be
five
or
six
of
us
altogether
,
all
ladies"-maid
,
miss
;
and
there
be
nothing
on
earth
to
do
all
the
day
long
,
only
sit
and
do
a
little
needlework
over
the
fire
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
few
minute
before
eight
Lady
Glencora
knock
at
Alice
's
door
,
and
take
her
arm
to
lead
her
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Alice
see
that
she
be
magnificently
dress
,
with
an
enormous
expanse
of
robe
,
and
that
her
lock
have
be
so
manage
that
no
one
could
suspect
the
presence
of
a
grey
hair
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
with
all
her
magnificence
,
she
look
almost
a
child
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
let
me
see
,
"
she
say
,
as
they
go
down
-
stair
together
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
Jeffrey
to
take
you
in
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
be
about
the
easy
young
man
we
have
here
.
<EOS>
He
rather
turn
up
his
nose
at
everything
,
but
that
do
not
make
him
the
less
agreeable
;
do
it
,
dear
?
 
unless
he
turn
up
his
nose
at
you
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
perhaps
he
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
he
will
not
do
that
.
<EOS>
that
would
be
uncourteous
,
 
and
he
be
the
most
courteous
man
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
there
be
nobody
here
,
you
see
,
"
she
say
as
they
enter
the
room
,
"
and
I
do
not
suppose
there
would
be
.
<EOS>
It
be
always
proper
to
be
first
in
one
's
own
house
.
<EOS>
I
do
so
try
to
be
proper
,
 
and
it
be
such
trouble
.
<EOS>
talk
of
people
earn
their
bread
,
Alice
;
 
I
be
sure
I
earn
mine
.
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
 
<EOS>
what
fun
it
would
be
to
be
sit
somewhere
in
Asia
,
eat
a
chicken
with
one
's
finger
,
and
light
a
big
fire
outside
one
's
tent
to
keep
off
the
lion
and
tiger
.
<EOS>
fancy
your
be
on
one
side
of
the
fire
and
the
lion
and
tiger
on
the
other
,
grin
at
you
through
the
flame
!
"
<EOS>
then
Lady
Glencora
strove
to
look
like
a
lion
,
and
grin
at
herself
in
the
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
sort
of
grin
would
not
frighten
me
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
not
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
read
about
it
in
that
woman
's
travel
.
<EOS>
oh
,
here
they
be
,
and
I
must
not
make
any
more
face
.
<EOS>
Duchess
,
do
come
to
the
fire
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
get
warm
again
.
<EOS>
this
be
my
cousin
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
Duchess
make
a
stiff
little
bow
of
condescension
,
and
then
declare
that
she
be
charmingly
warm
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
how
you
manage
in
your
house
,
but
the
staircase
be
so
comfortable
.
<EOS>
now
at
Longroyston
we
have
take
all
the
trouble
in
the
world
,
 
put
down
hot
-
water
pipe
all
over
the
house
,
and
everything
else
that
could
be
think
of
,
and
yet
,
you
can
not
move
about
the
place
without
meet
with
draught
at
every
corner
of
the
passage
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Duchess
speak
with
an
enormous
emphasis
on
every
other
word
,
sometimes
put
so
great
a
stress
on
some
special
syllable
,
as
almost
to
bring
her
voice
to
a
whistle
.
<EOS>
this
she
have
do
with
the
word
"
pipe
"
to
a
great
degree
,
 
so
that
Alice
never
afterwards
forget
the
hot
-
water
pipe
of
Longroyston
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
tell
Lady
Glencora
,
Miss
Palliser
,
that
I
never
know
a
house
so
warm
as
this
,
 
or
,
I
be
sorry
to
say
,
"
 
and
here
the
emphasis
be
very
strong
on
the
word
<EOS>
sorry
,
 
"
so
cold
as
Longroyston
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
tone
in
which
Longroyston
be
uttered
would
almost
have
draw
tear
from
a
critical
audience
in
the
pit
of
a
playhouse
.
<EOS>
the
Duchess
be
a
woman
of
about
forty
,
very
handsome
,
but
with
no
meaning
in
her
beauty
,
carry
a
good
fix
colour
in
her
face
,
which
do
not
look
like
paint
,
but
which
probably
have
receive
some
little
assistance
from
art
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
well
-
build
,
sizeable
woman
,
with
good
proportion
and
fine
health
,
 
but
a
fool
.
<EOS>
She
have
address
herself
to
one
Miss
Palliser
;
but
two
Miss
Pallisers
,
cousin
of
Plantagenet
Palliser
,
have
enter
the
room
at
the
same
time
,
of
whom
I
may
say
,
whatever
other
trait
of
character
they
may
have
possess
,
that
at
any
rate
they
be
not
fool
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
always
easy
to
warm
a
small
house
like
this
,
"
say
Miss
Palliser
,
whose
christian
name
,
unfortunately
for
her
,
be
Iphigenia
Theodata
,
and
who
by
her
cousin
and
sister
be
call
iphy
 
"
<EOS>
and
I
suppose
equally
difficult
to
warm
a
large
one
such
as
Longroyston
.
<EOS>
"
the
other
Miss
Palliser
have
be
christen
Euphemia
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
get
no
pipe
,
Duchess
,
at
any
rate
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
;
and
Alice
,
as
she
sit
listen
,
think
she
discern
in
Lady
Glencora
's
pronunciation
of
the
word
pipe
an
almost
hide
imitation
of
the
Duchess
's
whistle
.
<EOS>
It
must
have
be
so
,
for
at
the
moment
Lady
Glencora
's
eye
meet
Alice
's
for
an
instant
,
and
be
then
withdraw
,
so
that
Alice
be
compel
to
think
that
her
friend
and
cousin
be
not
always
quite
successful
in
those
struggle
she
make
to
be
proper
.
  
<EOS>
then
the
gentleman
come
in
one
after
another
,
and
other
lady
,
till
about
thirty
people
be
assemble
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
come
up
and
speak
another
word
to
Alice
in
a
kind
voice
,
 
mean
to
express
some
sense
of
connection
if
not
cousinship
.

Alice

who
have
already
begin
to
feel
desolate

be
grateful
,

make
up
her

Jeffrey

<EOS>
dinner
at
Matching
Priory

Alice
find
herself
seat
near
to
Lady
Glencora
's
end
of
the

,
in

of
her
resolution
to
like
Mr.

she
be
not

that
such
an
arrangement
have
be

Mr.

have
take
the
Duchess
out
to
dinner

to
be
as
far
remove
as

from
her
Grace

<EOS>
She
find
herself
seat
between
her
bespoken
friend
Jeffrey

the
Duke

as
soon
as
she
be
seat
Lady
Glencora
introduce
her
to
her
second
neighbour

My

a
terrible
Radical

oh
,
indeed
;
I
be
glad
of
that

We
be
sadly
in

perhaps
I
may
be
able
to
gain
one
now

<EOS>
Alice
thought
of
her

instead
of

be
sit
next
to
the

St.

I
be
afraid
I
never

You
shall
lead
me
at

no

not

there
be
nothing
I

do
you

<EOS>
I
do
not

<EOS>
I
have

Alice

almost
tremble
at

put
the
question
.

"
well
;
no
,
I
have
not
.

I
suppose
that
be
the
crux
.

the
ballot
have
never
be
seriously
bring
before
any
House
in
which
I
have
sit
.
<EOS>
I
hate
it
with
so
keen
a
private
hatred

that
I
doubt
whether
I
could
vote
for
it

<EOS>

the
Radicals
love
it

Alice

Palliser
,
"

the
Duke

speak
loudly
from
his
end

I
be
tell
you
can
never

entitle
to
call
yourself

you

vote
for

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
to
be
call
a
Radical

Mr.

to

call
anything
at
all

"
except
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
in
a
low
voice

and
that
be
about
the
fine
ambition
by
which
a
man
can
be
move
,

the
Duke

<EOS>
"
the
man
who
can
manage

then
that

drop

the

eat

"
I
be

commission

amuse
you

Mr.

when
I
undertake
the

I
have
no

I
do
nothing

Mr.

it

have
not

thank
God
,
they
can
not
do
much
in
that
way

not
directly
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
only
think
where
we
should
be
if
we
have
a
feminine
House
of
Commons
,
with
feminine
debate
,
carry
on
,
of
course

with

My

Phemy

would

be
member

You
do
not
know
them
yet

<EOS>
"
no
;
not
yet
.
<EOS>
be
they
politician
?
"
  
"
not
especially
.
<EOS>
They
have
their
tendency
,
which
be
decidedly
liberal
.
<EOS>
there
have
never
be
a
Tory
Palliser
know
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
too
clever
to
give
themselves
up
to
anything
in
which
they
can
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
be
woman
they
live
a
depressed
life
,
devote
themselves
to
literature
,
fine
art
,
social
economy
,
and
the
abstract
science
.
<EOS>
They
write
wonderful
letter
;
but
I
believe
their
correspondence
list
be
quite
full
,
so
that
you
have
no
chance
at
present
of
get
on
either
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
slight
pretension

ask
for
such
an
honour

"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
if
you
mean
because
you

They
do
not

all
seek
people
of
note

their
correspondent

<EOS>
free
communication
with
all
the
world
be
their
motto
,
and
Rowland
Hill
be
the
god
they
worship

<EOS>
only
they
have
be
force
to
guard
themselves
against
too
great
an
accession
of
paper

be
you
fond

yes

I
like
get
them
better

I
shrewdly
suspect
they
do

half
what
they
get

be
it
possible
any
one
should
go
through
two
sheet
of
paper
fill
by
our
friend

Duchess
there

<EOS>
no

their
delight
be
in
writing

<EOS>
They
sit
each
at
her
desk
after
breakfast
,

go
on
till
lunch

<EOS>
there
be
a
little
rivalry
between
them

not
express
to
each
other
,

visible
to
their
friend

<EOS>
iphy
certainly
do
get
off
the
great
number
,

I
be
tell
crosse
quite
as
often
as
Phemy

then
she
have
the
advantage
of
a
bolder
and
large
hand

do
they
write

you

oh
,
dear
<EOS>
no

<EOS>
I
do
not

do
not

family
affair

such
topic

<EOS>
architecture
go
a
long
way
with

whether

<EOS>
iphy
have
certain

take
up

of

time

she
acknowledge
she
do

you
be

american

<EOS>
I
do
hate
the
Americans

It
be
the
only
strong
political
feeling
I
have

go
there
once

find
I
could
not

with
them
on
any
term

they
please
themselves
.

I
do
not

they
be
to
be
hate

they
do
not
live
after
our
fashion

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
;
it
be
jealousy
of
course

<EOS>
I
know
that

I
do
not
come
across
a
cab
-
driver
who
be
not
a

better
educate

I
be

as
for
their

they
know
everything

I
hate

I
intend
to
hate
them

You
have
not
be
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
no
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
make
bold
to
say
that
any
english
lady
who
spend
a
month
with
them
and
do
not
hate
them
would
have
very
singular
taste
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
they
will
eat
each
other
up
,
and
then
there
will
come
an
entirely
new
set
of
people
of
a
different
sort
.
<EOS>
I
always
regard
the
States
as
a
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
,
prosper
in
wickedness
,
on
which
fire
and
brimstone
be
sure
to
fall
sooner

later

I
think
that
be
wicked

I
be
wicked

Topsy
use

you
hunt

<EOS>
yes

I
be
stay

do
you
ride

no

I

do
you
drive

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

I
do
not
drive
either

"
  
<EOS>
"
then
what
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
sit
at
home
,
and
 
"
  
"
mend
your
stocking
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
do
not
do
that
,
because
it
be
disagreeable
;
but
I
do
work
a
good
deal
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
have
amuse
myself
by
read
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
;
they
never
do
that
here
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
that
there
be
a
library
,

the
clue
to
it
have
be
lose
,
and
nobody
now
know
the
way

<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
in
library
.
<EOS>
nobody
ever
go
into
a
library
to
read
,
any
more
than
you
would
into
a
larder
to
eat
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
this
difference
;
 
the
food
you
consume
do
come
out
of
the
larder
,
but
the
book
you
read
never
come
out
of
the
library
.
<EOS>
"
  
"

Mudie
's
,
"

Alice

<EOS>
"
ah
,
yes
;
he
be
the
great
librarian
.
<EOS>

you
mean
to
read
all
the
time
you
be
here
,
Miss
Vavasor

I
mean
to
walk
about
the
priory
ruin
sometimes

then
you
must
go
by
moonlight
,
and
I
will
go
with
you
.
<EOS>
only
be
not
it
rather
late
in
the
year
for
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
it
be
,
 
for
you
,
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
the
Duke
speak
to
her
again
,
and
she
find
that
she
get
on
very
well
during
dinner
.
<EOS>
but
she
could
not
but
feel
angry
with
herself
in
that
she
have
any
fear
on
the
subject
;
 
and
yet
she
could
not
divest
herself
of
that
fear
.
<EOS>
She
acknowledge
to
herself
that
she
be
conscious
of
a
certain
inferiority
to
Lady
Glencora
and
to
Mr.
Jeffrey
Palliser
,
which
almost
make
her
unhappy
.
<EOS>
as
regard
the
Duke
on
the
other
side
of
her
,
she
have
no
such
feeling
.
<EOS>
He
be
old
enough
to
be
her
father
,
and
be
a
Cabinet
Minister
;
therefore
he
be
entitle
to
her
reverence
.
<EOS>
but
how
be
it
that
she
could
not
help
accept
the
other
people
<EOS>
round
her
as
be
indeed
superior
to
herself
?
<EOS>
be
she
really
learn
to
believe
that
she
could
grow
upwards
by
their
sunlight
?

"
Jeffrey
be
a
pleasant
fellow

he
not

back
through
the
billiard

room
to

very
pleasant

a
little
sarcastic

soon

yourself
able

the

warm

her
emphasis
on
the

one

other

then
we
have
better
keep
continually
move

Mrs.

a
literary
lady

have
be
very
handsome

still
very
clever

the

me
tremble
in
every
limb
when
Mrs.
Sparkes
attack
her
,
"
Lady
Glencora
say
to
Alice
in
Alice
's
own
room
that
night
,
"
for
I
know
she
will
tell
the
Duke
;
and
he
will
tell
that
tall
man
with
red
hair
whom
you
see
stand
about
,
and
the
tall
man
with
red
hair
will
tell
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
then
I
shall
catch
it
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
who
be
the
tall
man
with
red
hair
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
political
link
between
the
Duke
and
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
His
name
be
Bott
,
and
he
be
a
Member
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
should
he
interfere
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
be
his
business
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
quite
understand
all
the
in
and
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
be
to
be
one
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
private
secretary
if
he
become
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
do
not
tell
;
 
<EOS>
only
I
think
he
do
all
the
same
.
<EOS>
He
always
call
me
Lady
Glen
-
cowrer
.
<EOS>
He
come
out
of
Lancashire
,
and
make
calico
as
long
as
he
could
get
any
cotton
.
<EOS>
"
but
this
happen
in
the
bedroom
,
and
we
must
go
back
for
a
while
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
the
Duchess
have
make
no
answer
to
Mrs.
Sparkes
,
and
<EOS>
so
nothing
further
be
say
about
the
warmth
.
<EOS>
nor
,
indeed
,
be
there
any
conversation
that
be
comfortably
general
.
<EOS>
the
number
of
lady
in
the
room
be
too
great
for
that
,
and
lady
do
not
divide
themselves
nicely
into
small
party
,
as
man
and
woman
do
when
they
be
mixed
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
behave
pretty
by
tell
the
Duchess
all
about
her
pet
pheasant
;
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
tell
ill
-
natured
tale
of
some
one
to
Miss
Euphemia
Palliser
;
one
of
the
Duchess
's
daughter
walk
off
to
a
distant
piano
with
an
admire
friend
and
touch
a
few
note
;
while
Iphigenia
Palliser
boldly
take
up
a
book
,
and
place
herself
at
a
table
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
who
be
sit
opposite
to
Lady
Glencora
,
begin
to
speculate
whether
she
may
do
the
same
;
but
her
courage
fail
her
,
and
she
sit
on
,
tell
herself
that
she
be
out
of
her
element
.
"
<EOS>
Alice
Vavasor
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
after
a
while
,
suddenly
,
and
in
a
somewhat
loud
voice
,
"
can
you
play
billiard
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Alice
,
rather
startled
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
shall
learn
to
-
night
,
and
if
nobody
else
will
teach
you
,
you
shall
be
my
pupil
.
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
Lady
Glencora
ring
the
bell
and
order
that
the
billiard
-
table
may
be
get
ready
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
play
,
Duchess
,
of
course
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
so
nice
and
warm
,
that
I
think
I
will
,
"
say
the
Duchess
;
but
as
she
speak
she
look
suspiciously
to
that
part
of
the
room
where
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
be
sit
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
us
all
play
,
"
say
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
,
"
and
then
it
will
be
nice
,
 
and
perhaps
warm
,
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
gentleman
join
them
just
as
they
be
settle
themselves
round
the
table
,
and
as
many
of
them
stay
there
,
the
billiard
-
room
become
full
.
<EOS>
Alice
have
first
a
cue
put
into
her
hand
,
and
make
nothing
of
that
be
permit
to
play
with
a
mace
.
<EOS>
the
duty
of
instruct
her
devolved
on
Jeffrey
Palliser
,
and
the
next
hour
pass
pleasantly
;
 
not
so
pleasantly
,
she
think
afterwards
,
as
do
some
of
those
hour
in
Switzerland
when
her
cousin
be
with
her
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
she
could
get
more
out
of
her
life
with
such
associate
as
them
,
than
she
could
with
any
of
these
people
at
Matching
.
<EOS>
She
feel
quite
sure
of
that
;
 
though
Jeffrey
Palliser
do
take
great
trouble
to
teach
her
the
game
,
and
once
or
twice
make
her
laugh
heartily
by
quiz
the
Duchess
's
attitude
as
she
stand
up
to
make
her
stroke
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
play
billiard
,
"
say
Mrs.
Sparkes
,
on
one
of
these
occasion
;
"
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
say
you
be
come
to
play
,
"
say
the
Duchess
,
almost
majestically
,
and
with
a
tone
of
triumph
evidently
produce
by
her
own
success
.
  
<EOS>
"
only
to
see
your
grace
,
"
say
Mrs.
Sparkes
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
there
be
anything
more
to
see
in
me
than
in
anybody
else
,
"
say
the
Duchess
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
that
be
a
cannon
.
<EOS>
Will
you
mark
that
for
our
side
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
no
,
Duchess
,
you
hit
the
same
ball
twice
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
very
well
;
 
then
I
suppose
Miss
Vavasor
play
now
.
<EOS>
that
be
a
miss
.
<EOS>
Will
you
mark
that
,
if
you
please
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
latter
demand
be
make
with
great
stress
,
as
though
she
have
be
defraud
in
the
matter
of
the
cannon
,
and
be
obey
.
<EOS>
before
long
,
the
Duchess
,
with
her
partner
,
Lady
Glencora
,
win
the
game
,
 
which
fact
,
however
,
be
,
I
think
,
owe
rather
to
Alice
's
ignorance
than
to
her
grace
's
skill
.
<EOS>
the
Duchess
,
however
,
be
very
triumphant
,
and
make
her
way
back
into
the
drawing
-
room
with
a
step
which
seem
to
declare
loudly
that
she
have
trump
Mrs.
Sparkes
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
not
long
after
this
the
lady
go
up
-
stair
on
their
way
to
bed
.
<EOS>
many
of
them
,
perhaps
,
do
not
go
to
their
pillow
at
once
,
as
it
be
as
yet
not
eleven
o'clock
,
and
it
be
past
ten
when
they
all
come
down
to
breakfast
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
Alice
,
who
have
be
up
at
seven
,
do
not
go
to
bed
then
,
nor
for
the
next
two
hour
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
come
into
your
room
just
for
one
minute
,
"
Lady
Glencora
say
as
she
pass
on
from
the
door
to
her
own
room
;
and
in
about
five
minute
she
be
back
with
her
cousin
.
"
<EOS>
Would
you
mind
go
into
my
room
 
<EOS>
it
be
just
there
,
and
sit
with
Ellen
for
a
minute

"
<EOS>
this
Lady
Glencora
say
in
the
sweetest
possible
tone
to
the
girl
who
be
wait
on
Alice
;
and
then
,
when
they
be
alone
together
,
she
get
into
a
little
chair
by
the
fireside
and
prepare
herself
for
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
keep
you
up
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
while
I
tell
you
something

first
of
all
,
how
do
you
like
the
people
?
<EOS>
Will
you
be
able
to
be
comfortable
with
them
?
"
<EOS>
alice
of
course
say
that
she
think
she
would
;
and
then
there
come
that
little
discussion
in
which
the
duty
of
Mr.
Bott
,
the
man
with
the
red
hair
,
be
describe
.

some
twenty
minute

Alice
feel
sure
that
the
thing
to
be
tell
would
have
some
reference
to
Mr.

she
do
not

to

Mr.

hard

indeed

for

so
weight

so
small

Alice
begin
to

now
that
she

entice
to
Matching

get
up

yes

you
will
come

make
in
her
mind
a
sort
of
bargain

she
be
not

house
after
the
fashion
in

Lady

it
strike
her
at
once
that
this
be
unworthy

ungenerous

I
will
come

should
not
I

you
know
what
I
mean

We
shall
have
dinner

party

lot
of
people

we
shall
have
none

Alice

smile

and
therefore
there
be
so
much
more
excuse
for
your
coming

rather

mean
so
much
more
reason

get
over

now

then
she
smile

return
the
kiss
which
Alice
have
give
her

It
be
singular
to
see
her
standing
on

with

hair
push
back

her
ear
,
and
her
eye
red
with
tear
,
 
as
though
the
burden
of
the
magnificence
remain
to
her
after
its
purpose
be
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
declare
it
be
ever
so
much
past
twelve
.
<EOS>
good
night
,
now
,
dear
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
he
be
come
up
.
<EOS>
but
I
should
have
hear
his
step
if
he
have
.
<EOS>
He
never
tread
lightly
.
<EOS>
He
seldom
give
over
work
till
after
one
,
and
sometimes
go
on
till
three
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
only
thing
he
like
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
<EOS>
good
night
.
<EOS>
I
have
such
a
deal
more
to
say
to
you
;
and
Alice
,
you
must
tell
me
something
about
yourself
,
too
;
will
not
you
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
without
wait
for
an
answer
Lady
Glencora
go
,
leave
Alice
in
a
maze
of
bewilderment
.
<EOS>
She
could
hardly
believe
that
all
she
have
hear
,
and
all
she
have
do
,
have
happen
since
she
leave
Queen
Anne
Street
that
morning
.
   
<EOS>
three
politician
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
be
one
of
those
politician
in
possess
whom
England
have
perhaps
more
reason
to
be
proud
than
of
any
other
of
her
resource
,
and
who
,
as
a
body
,
give
to
her
that
exquisite
combination
of
conservatism
and
progress
which
be
her
present
strength
and
good
security
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
He
could
afford
to
learn
to
be
a
statesman
,
and
have
the
industry
want
for
such
training
.
<EOS>
He
be
bear
in
the
purple
,
noble
himself
,
and
heir
to
the
high
rank
as
well
as
one
of
the
great
fortune
of
the
country
,
already
very
rich
,
surround
by
all
the
temptation
of
luxury
and
pleasure
;
and
yet
he
devote
himself
to
work
with
the
grind
energy
of
a
young
penniless
barrister
labour
for
a
penniless
wife
,
and
do
so
without
any
motive
more
selfish
than
that
of
be
count
in
the
roll
of
the
public
servant
of
England
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
brilliant
man
,
and
understand
well
that
such
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
listen
to
in
the
House
,
as
the
phrase
go
;
but
he
be
listen
to
as
a
laborious
man
,
who
be
in
earnest
in
what
he
do
,
who
get
up
his
fact
with
accuracy
,
and
who
,
dull
though
he
be
,
be
worthy
of
confidence
.
<EOS>
and
he
be
very
dull
.
<EOS>
He
rather
pride
himself
on
be
dull
,
and
on
conquer
in
spite
of
his
dullness
.
<EOS>
He
never
allow
himself
a
joke
in
his
speech
,
nor
attempt
even
the
small
flourish
of
rhetoric
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
careful
in
his
language
,
labour
night
and
day
to
learn
to
express
himself
with
accuracy
,
with
no
needless
repetition
of
word
,
perspicuously
with
regard
to
the
special
object
he
may
have
in
view
.
<EOS>
He
have
teach
himself
to
believe
that
oratory
,
as
oratory
,
be
a
sin
against
that
honesty
in
politic
by
which
he
strove
to
guide
himself
.
<EOS>
He
desire
to
use
word
for
the
purpose
of
teach
thing
which
he
know
and
which
other
do
not
know
;
and
he
desire
also
to
be
honour
for
his
knowledge
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
no
desire
to
be
honour
for
the
language
in
which
his
knowledge
be
convey
.
<EOS>
He
be
an
upright
,
thin
,
laborious
man
;
who
by
his
part
alone
could
have
serve
no
political
party
materially
,
but
whose
part
be
sufficient
to
make
his
education
,
integrity
,
and
industry
useful
in
the
high
degree
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
trust
which
such
man
inspire
which
make
them
so
serviceable
;
 
trust
not
only
in
their
labour
,
 
for
any
man
rise
from
the
mass
of
the
people
may
be
equally
laborious
;
nor
yet
simply
in
their
honesty
and
patriotism
.
<EOS>
the
confidence
be
give
to
their
labour
,
honesty
,
and
patriotism
join
to
such
a
personal
stake
in
the
country
as
give
them
a
weight
and
ballast
which
no
politician
in
England
can
possess
without
it
.
  
<EOS>
if
he
be
dull
as
a
statesman
he
be
more
dull
in
private
life
,
and
it
may
be
imagine
that
such
a
woman
as
his
wife
would
find
some
difficulty
in
make
his
society
the
source
of
her
happiness
.
<EOS>
Their
marriage
,
in
a
point
of
view
regard
business
,
have
be
a
complete
success
,
 
and
a
success
,
too
,
when
on
the
one
side
,
that
of
Lady
Glencora
,
there
have
be
terrible
danger
of
shipwreck
,
and
when
on
his
side
also
there
have
be
some
little
fear
of
a
mishap
.
<EOS>
as
regard
her
it
have
be
tell
how
near
she
go
to
throw
herself
,
with
all
her
vast
wealth
,
into
the
arm
of
a
young
man
,
whom
no
father
,
no
guardian
could
have
regard
as
a
well
-
choose
husband
for
any
girl
;
 
one
who
as
yet
have
show
no
good
quality
,
who
have
be
a
spendthrift
,
unprinciple
,
and
debauch
.
<EOS>
alas
,
she
have
love
him
!
<EOS>
It
be
possible
that
her
love
and
her
wealth
may
have
turn
him
from
evil
to
good
.
<EOS>
but
who
would
have
venture
to
risk
her
,
 
I
will
not
say
her
and
her
vast
inheritance
,
 
on
such
a
chance
?
<EOS>
that
evil
,
however
,
have
be
prevent
,
and
those
about
her
have
manage
to
marry
her
to
a
young
man
,
very
steady
by
nature
,
with
worldly
prospect
as
brilliant
as
her
own
,
and
with
a
station
than
which
the
world
offer
nothing
high
.
<EOS>
His
little
threatened
mischance
,
 
a
pass
fancy
for
a
married
lady
who
be
too
wise
to
receive
vow
which
be
proffer
not
in
the
most
ardent
manner
,
 
have
,
from
special
reason
,
give
some
little
alarm
to
his
uncle
,
which
have
just
suffice
at
the
time
to
make
so
very
judicious
a
marriage
doubly
pleasant
to
that
noble
duke
,
so
that
all
thing
and
all
people
have
conspire
to
shower
substantial
comfort
on
the
head
of
this
couple
,
when
they
be
join
together
,
and
man
and
woman
have
not
yet
cease
to
declare
how
happy
be
both
in
the
accumulate
gift
of
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
and
as
regard
Mr.
Palliser
,
I
think
that
his
married
life
,
and
the
wife
,
whom
he
certainly
have
not
choose
,
but
who
have
drop
upon
him
,
suit
him
admirably
.
<EOS>
He
want
great
wealth
for
that
position
at
which
he
aim
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
rich
before
his
marriage
with
his
own
wealth
,
 
so
rich
that
he
could
throw
thousand
away
if
he
wish
it
;
but
for
him
and
his
career
be
need
that
colossal
wealth
which
would
make
man
talk
about
it
,
 
which
would
necessitate
an
expansive
expenditure
,
reach
far
and
wide
,
do
nothing
,
or
less
than
nothing
,
for
his
own
personal
comfort
,
but
give
to
him
at
once
that
rock
-
like
solidity
which
be
so
necessary
to
our
great
aristocratic
politician
.
<EOS>
and
his
wife
be
,
as
far
as
he
know
,
all
that
he
desire
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
dabble
much
in
the
fountain
of
Venus
,
though
he
have
forget
himself
once
,
and
sin
in
covet
another
man
's
wife
.
<EOS>
but
his
sin
then
have
hardly
pollute
his
natural
character
,
and
his
desire
have
be
of
a
kind
which
be
almost
more
gratified
in
its
disappointment
than
it
would
have
be
in
its
fruition
.
<EOS>
on
the
morning
after
the
lady
have
frown
on
him
he
have
tell
himself
that
he
be
very
well
out
of
that
trouble
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
it
would
never
be
for
him
to
hang
up
on
the
wall
of
a
temple
a
well
-
wear
lute
as
a
votive
offering
when
leave
the
pursuit
of
love
.
<EOS>
_
Idoneus
puelli
_
he
never
could
have
be
.
<EOS>
so
he
marry
Lady
Glencora
and
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
the
story
of
Burgo
Fitzgerald
be
tell
to
him
,
and
he
suppose
that
most
girl
have
some
such
story
to
tell
.
<EOS>
He
think
little
about
it
,
and
by
no
means
understand
her
when
she
say
to
him
,
with
all
the
impressiveness
which
she
could
throw
into
the
word
,
"
You
must
know
that
I
have
really
love
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
must
love
me
now
,
"
he
have
reply
with
a
smile
;
and
then
as
regard
his
mind
,
the
thing
be
over
.
<EOS>
and
since
his
marriage
he
have
think
that
thing
matrimonial
have
go
well
with
him
,
and
with
her
too
.
<EOS>
He
give
her
almost
unlimited
power
of
enjoy
her
money
,
and
interfere
but
little
in
her
way
of
life
.
<EOS>
sometimes
he
would
say
a
word
of
caution
to
her
with
reference
to
those
childish
way
which
hardly
become
the
dull
dignity
of
his
position
;
and
his
word
then
would
have
in
them
something
of
unintentional
severity
,
 
whether
instigated
or
not
by
the
red
-
haired
Radical
Member
of
Parliament
,
I
will
not
pretend
to
say
;
 
but
on
the
whole
he
be
content
and
love
his
wife
,
as
he
think
,
very
heartily
,
and
at
least
better
than
he
love
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
one
cause
of
unhappiness
,
or
rather
one
doubt
as
to
his
entire
good
fortune
,
be
begin
to
make
itself
feel
,
as
his
wife
have
to
her
sorrow
already
discover
.
<EOS>
He
have
hope
that
before
this
he
may
have
hear
that
she
would
give
him
a
child
.
<EOS>
but
the
day
be
young
yet
for
that
trouble
,
and
the
care
have
not
become
a
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
judicious
arrangement
as
to
property
,
this
well
-
order
alliance
between
family
,
have
not
perhaps
suit
her
as
well
as
it
have
suit
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
she
may
have
learn
to
forget
her
early
lover
,
or
to
look
back
upon
it
with
a
soft
melancholy
hardly
amount
to
regret
,
have
her
new
lord
be
more
tender
in
his
way
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
Lady
Glencora
's
heart
be
make
of
that
stern
stuff
which
refuse
to
change
its
impression
;
but
it
be
a
heart
,
and
it
require
food
.
<EOS>
to
love
and
fondle
someone
,
 
to
be
love
and
fondle
,
be
absolutely
necessary
to
her
happiness
.
<EOS>
She
want
the
little
daily
assurance
of
her
supremacy
in
the
man
's
feeling
,
the
constant
touch
of
love
,
half
accidental
half
contrive
,
the
pass
glance
of
the
eye
tell
perhaps
of
some
little
joke
understand
only
between
them
two
rather
than
of
love
,
the
softness
of
an
occasional
kiss
give
here
and
there
when
chance
may
bring
them
together
,
some
half
-
pretended
interest
in
her
little
doing
,
a
nod
,
a
wink
,
a
shake
of
the
head
,
or
even
a
pout
.
<EOS>
It
should
have
be
give
to
her
to
feed
upon
such
food
as
this
daily
,
and
then
she
would
have
forget
Burgo
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Palliser
understand
none
of
these
thing
;
and
therefore
the
image
of
Burgo
Fitzgerald
in
all
his
beauty
be
ever
before
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
but
not
the
less
be
Mr.
Palliser
<EOS>
a
prosperous
man
,
as
to
the
success
of
whose
career
few
who
know
him
have
much
doubt
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
write
in
the
book
of
his
destiny
that
he
would
have
to
pass
through
some
violent
domestic
trouble
,
some
ruin
in
the
hope
of
his
home
,
of
a
nature
to
destroy
then
and
for
ever
the
worldly
prospect
of
other
man
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
one
who
would
pass
through
such
violence
,
should
it
come
upon
him
,
without
much
scathe
.
<EOS>
to
lose
his
influence
with
his
party
would
be
bad
to
him
than
to
lose
his
wife
,
and
public
disgrace
would
hit
him
harder
than
private
dishonour
.
  
<EOS>
and
the
present
be
the
very
moment
in
which
success
be
,
as
be
say
,
come
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
already
hold
laborious
office
under
the
Crown
,
but
have
never
sit
in
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
He
have
work
much
harder
than
Cabinet
Ministers
generally
work
,
 
but
hitherto
have
work
without
any
reward
that
be
worth
his
have
.
<EOS>
for
the
stipend
which
he
have
receive
have
be
nothing
to
him
,
 
as
the
great
stipend
which
he
would
receive
,
if
his
hope
be
true
,
would
also
be
nothing
to
him
.
<EOS>
to
have
ascendancy
over
other
man
,
to
be
know
by
his
countryman
as
one
of
their
real
ruler
,
to
have
an
actual
and
acknowledge
voice
in
the
management
of
nation
,
 
those
be
the
reward
for
which
he
look
;
and
now
in
truth
it
seem
as
though
they
be
come
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
but
know
that
the
exist
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
would
separate
himself
from
the
Government
,
carry
various
other
with
him
,
either
before
or
immediately
consequent
on
the
meeting
of
Parliament
;
 
and
it
be
all
but
know
,
also
,
that
Mr.
Palliser
would
fill
his
place
,
take
that
high
office
at
once
,
although
he
have
never
hitherto
sit
in
that
august
assembly
which
man
call
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
He
could
thus
afford
to
put
up
with
the
small
everyday
calamity
of
have
a
wife
who
love
another
man
better
than
she
love
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
presence
of
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
at
Matching
be
assume
to
be
a
sure
sign
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
come
triumph
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
be
a
statesman
of
a
very
different
class
,
but
he
also
have
be
eminently
successful
as
an
aristocratic
pillar
of
the
British
Constitutional
Republic
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
minister
of
very
many
year
"
standing
,
be
as
use
to
cabinet
sitting
as
other
man
be
to
their
own
armchair
;
but
he
have
never
be
a
hard
-
working
man
.
<EOS>
though
a
constant
politician
,
he
have
ever
take
politic
easy
whether
in
office
or
out
.
<EOS>
the
world
have
say
before
now
that
the
Duke
may
be
Premier
,
only
that
he
would
not
take
the
trouble
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
consult
by
a
very
distinguished
person
,
 
so
the
paper
have
say
more
than
once
,
 
as
to
the
making
of
Prime
Ministers
.
<EOS>
His
voice
in
council
be
esteem
to
be
very
great
.
<EOS>
He
be
regard
as
a
strong
rock
of
support
to
the
liberal
cause
,
and
yet
nobody
ever
know
what
he
do
;
nor
be
there
much
record
of
what
he
say
.
<EOS>
the
office
which
he
hold
,
or
have
hold
,
be
generally
those
to
which
no
very
arduous
duty
be
attach
.
<EOS>
in
severe
debate
he
never
take
upon
himself
the
brunt
of
opposition
oratory
.
<EOS>
what
he
say
in
the
House
be
generally
short
and
pleasant
,
 
with
some
slight
,
drolling
,
undercurrent
of
uninjurious
satire
run
through
it
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
a
walk
miracle
of
the
wisdom
of
common
sense
.
<EOS>
He
never
lose
his
temper
.
<EOS>
He
never
make
mistake
.
<EOS>
He
never
grow
either
hot
or
cold
in
a
cause
.
<EOS>
He
be
never
reckless
in
politic
,
and
never
cowardly
.
<EOS>
He
snub
no
man
,
and
take
snubbing
from
no
man
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
Knight
of
the
Garter
,
a
Lord
Lieutenant
of
his
county
,
and
at
sixty
-
two
have
his
digestion
unimpaired
and
his
estate
in
excellent
order
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
great
buyer
of
picture
,
which
,
perhaps
,
he
do
not
understand
,
and
a
great
collector
of
book
which
certainly
he
never
read
.
<EOS>
all
the
world
respect
him
,
and
he
be
a
man
to
whom
the
respect
of
all
the
world
be
as
the
breath
of
his
nostril
.
  
<EOS>
but
even
he
be
not
without
his
peacock
on
the
wall
,
his
skeleton
in
the
closet
,
his
thorn
in
his
side
;
though
the
peacock
do
not
scream
loud
,
the
skeleton
be
not
very
terrible
in
his
anatomical
arrangement
,
nor
be
the
thorn
likely
to
fester
to
a
gangrene
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
be
always
in
awe
about
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
ever
uneasy
about
his
wife
,
but
it
must
not
be
suppose
that
he
fear
the
machination
of
any
Burgo
Fitzgerald
as
be
destructive
of
his
domestic
comfort
.
<EOS>
the
Duchess
be
and
always
have
be
all
that
be
proper
.
<EOS>
lady
in
high
rank
,
when
gift
with
excel
beauty
,
have
often
be
make
the
mark
of
undeserved
calumny
;
 
but
no
breath
of
slander
have
ever
touch
her
name
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
any
man
alive
have
ever
have
the
courage
even
to
wink
at
her
since
the
Duke
have
first
call
her
his
own
.
<EOS>
nor
be
she
a
spendthrift
,
or
a
gambler
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
fast
in
her
taste
,
or
give
to
any
pursuit
that
be
objectionable
.
<EOS>
She
be
simply
a
fool
,
and
as
a
fool
be
ever
fear
that
she
be
the
mark
of
ridicule
.
<EOS>
in
all
such
misery
she
would
complain
sorrowfully
,
piteously
,
and
occasionally
very
angrily
,
to
her
dear
Duke
and
protector
;
till
sometimes
her
dear
Duke
do
not
quite
know
what
to
do
with
her
or
how
to
protect
her
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
suit
him
,
a
Knight
of
the
Garter
and
a
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
,
to
beg
mercy
for
that
poor
wife
of
his
from
such
a
one
as
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
;
nor
would
it
be
more
in
his
way
to
lodge
a
formal
complaint
against
that
lady
before
his
host
or
hostess
,
 
as
one
boy
at
school
may
sometimes
do
as
regard
another
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
do
not
like
the
people
,
my
dear
,
we
will
go
away
,
"
he
say
to
her
late
on
that
evening
of
which
we
have
speak
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
"
she
reply
,
"
I
do
not
wish
to
go
away
.
<EOS>
I
have
say
that
we
would
stay
till
December
,
and
Longroyston
will
not
be
ready
before
that
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
that
something
ought
to
be
do
to
silence
that
woman
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
accent
come
strong
upon
"
something
,
"
and
then
again
with
terrific
violence
upon
"
woman
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
Duke
do
not
know
how
to
silence
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
principle
of
his
life
never
to
be
angry
with
any
one
.
<EOS>
how
could
he
get
at
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
?
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
she
be
worth
your
attention
,
"
say
the
husband
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
very
well
,
Duke
,
"
say
the
wife
,
"
and
perhaps
she
be
not
.
<EOS>
but
I
find
her
in
this
house
,
and
I
do
not
like
to
be
laugh
at
.
<EOS>
I
think
Lady
Glencora
should
make
her
know
her
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lady
Glencora
be
very
young
,
my
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
about
be
so
very
young
,
"
say
the
Duchess
,
whose
ear
have
perhaps
catch
some
little
hint
of
poor
Lady
Glencora
's
almost
unintentional
mimicry
.
<EOS>
now
as
appeal
of
this
kind
be
be
make
frequently
to
the
Duke
,
and
as
he
be
often
drive
to
say
some
word
,
of
which
he
himself
hardly
approve
,
to
some
one
in
protection
of
his
Duchess
,
he
be
aware
that
the
matter
be
an
annoyance
,
and
at
time
almost
wish
that
her
grace
be
at
 
Longroyston
.
  
<EOS>
and
there
be
a
third
politician
stay
at
Matching
Priory
who
have
never
yet
rise
to
the
rank
of
a
statesman
,
but
who
have
his
hope
.
<EOS>
this
be
Mr.
Bott
,
the
member
for
St.
Helens
,
whom
Lady
Glencora
have
describe
as
a
man
who
stand
about
,
with
red
hair
,
 
and
perhaps
tell
tale
of
her
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
be
a
person
who
certainly
have
have
some
success
in
life
and
who
have
win
it
for
himself
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
very
young
,
be
at
this
time
only
just
on
the
right
side
of
fifty
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
enjoy
his
second
session
in
Parliament
,
have
be
return
as
a
pledge
disciple
of
the
Manchester
school
.
<EOS>
nor
have
he
apparently
be
false
to
his
pledge
.
<EOS>
at
St.
Helens
he
be
still
hold
to
be
a
good
man
and
true
.
<EOS>
but
they
who
sit
on
the
same
side
with
him
in
the
House
and
watch
his
political
manoeuvre
,
know
that
he
be
strive
hard
to
get
his
finger
into
the
public
pie
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
rich
man
,
though
he
have
make
calico
and
have
get
into
Parliament
.
<EOS>
and
though
he
claim
to
be
a
thoroughgoe
<EOS>
Radical
<EOS>
,
he
be
a
man
who
like
to
live
with
aristocrat
,
and
be
fond
of
listen
to
the
whisper
of
such
as
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
or
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
It
be
suppose
that
he
do
understand
something
of
finance
.
<EOS>
He
be
at
any
rate
great
in
figure
;
and
as
he
be
possess
of
much
industry
,
and
be
obedient
withal
,
he
be
a
man
who
may
make
himself
useful
to
a
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
ambitious
of
change
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
man
who
get
into
such
house
as
Matching
Priory
and
<EOS>
whose
presence
there
be
a
mystery
to
many
;
 
as
to
whom
the
lady
of
the
house
never
quite
understand
why
they
be
entertain
such
a
guest
.
"
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Bott
be
come
,
"
Mr.
Palliser
have
say
to
his
wife
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
!
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
have
answer
.
<EOS>
"
goodness
me
!
<EOS>
who
be
Mr.
Bott
?
"
<EOS>
"
He
be
member
for
St.
Helens
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
a
very
serviceable
man
in
his
way
.
"
<EOS>
"
and
what
be
I
to
do
with
him
?
"
ask
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
you
can
do
anything
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
who
have
a
great
deal
of
business
,
and
I
dare
say
he
will
spend
most
of
his
time
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
Mr.
Bott
arrive
.
<EOS>
but
though
a
huge
pile
of
letter
and
paper
come
to
him
every
morning
by
post
,
he
unfortunately
do
not
seem
to
spend
much
of
his
time
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
have
not
find
the
clue
to
that
lose
apartment
.
<EOS>
twice
he
go
out
shoot
,
but
as
on
the
first
day
he
shoot
the
keeper
,
and
on
the
second
very
nearly
shoot
the
Duke
,
he
give
that
up
.
<EOS>
hunt
he
decline
,
though
much
press
to
make
an
essay
in
that
art
by
Jeffrey
Palliser
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
spend
his
time
,
as
Lady
Glencora
say
,
in
stand
about
,
 
except
at
certain
time
when
he
be
closet
with
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
when
,
it
may
be
presume
,
he
make
himself
useful
.
<EOS>
on
such
day
he
would
be
see
at
the
hour
of
lunch
with
finger
much
stain
with
ink
,
and
it
be
generally
suppose
that
on
those
occasion
he
have
be
count
up
taxis
and
calculate
the
effect
of
great
financial
change
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
tall
,
wiry
,
strong
man
,
with
a
bald
head
and
bristly
red
beard
,
which
,
however
,
be
cut
off
from
his
upper
and
under
lip
.
<EOS>
this
be
unfortunate
,
as
have
he
hide
his
mouth
<EOS>
he
would
not
have
be
in
so
mark
a
degree
an
ugly
man
.
<EOS>
His
upper
lip
be
very
long
,
and
his
mouth
be
mean
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
find
that
without
the
help
of
a
razor
to
these
part
he
could
not
manage
his
soup
to
his
satisfaction
,
and
prefer
cleanliness
to
beauty
have
shave
himself
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
dislike
Mr.
Bott
so
much
,
"
Lady
Glencora
say
to
her
husband
,
"
if
he
do
not
rub
his
hand
and
smile
so
often
,
and
seem
to
be
go
to
say
something
when
he
really
be
not
go
to
say
anything
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
you
need
trouble
yourself
about
him
,
my
dear
,
"
Mr.
Palliser
have
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
when
he
look
at
me
in
that
way
,
I
can
not
help
stop
,
as
I
think
he
be
go
to
speak
;
and
then
he
always
say
,
"
Can
I
do
anything
for
you
,
Lady
Glen
-
cowrer
?
"
<EOS>
"
  
She
instantly
see
that
her
husband
do
not
like
this
.
"
do
not
be
angry
with
me
,
dear
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
admit
that
he
be
rather
a
bore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
at
all
angry
,
Glencora
,
"
say
the
husband
;
"
and
if
you
insist
upon
it
,
I
will
see
that
he
leave
;
 
and
in
such
case
will
of
course
never
ask
him
again
.
<EOS>
but
that
may
be
prejudicial
to
me
,
as
he
be
a
man
whom
I
trust
in
politic
,
and
who
may
perhaps
be
serviceable
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
of
course
Lady
Glencora
declare
that
Mr.
Bott
may
remain
as
long
as
he
and
her
husband
desire
,
and
of
course
she
mention
his
name
no
more
to
Mr.
Palliser
;
but
from
that
time
forth
she
regard
Mr.
Bott
as
an
enemy
,
and
feel
also
that
Mr.
Bott
regard
her
in
the
same
light
.
  
<EOS>
when
it
be
know
among
outside
politician
that
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
be
stay
at
Matching
Priory
,
outside
<EOS>
politician
become
more
sure
than
ever
that
Mr.
Palliser
would
be
the
new
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
<EOS>
the
old
minister
and
the
young
minister
be
of
course
arrange
matter
together
.
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
whether
Mr.
Palliser
and
the
Duke
ever
speak
on
any
such
topic
during
the
entire
visit
.
<EOS>
though
Mr.
Bott
be
occasionally
closet
with
Mr.
Palliser
,
the
Duke
never
trouble
himself
with
such
closeting
.
<EOS>
He
go
out
shoot
 
on
his
pony
,
read
his
newspaper
,
write
his
note
,
and
look
with
the
eye
of
a
connoisseur
over
all
Mr.
Palliser
's
farming
apparatus
.
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
have
a
good
man
,
I
should
say
,
"
say
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
hubbing
?
<EOS>
yes
;
 
he
be
a
legacy
from
my
uncle
when
he
give
me
up
the
Priory
.
"
<EOS>
"
a
very
good
man
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
will
not
make
it
pay
;
but
he
will
make
it
look
as
though
it
do
;
 
which
be
the
next
good
thing
.
<EOS>
I
could
never
get
rend
out
of
land
that
I
farm
myself
,
 
never
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
do
not
care
much
about
it
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
would
have
talk
to
him
by
the
hour
together
about
farming
have
Mr.
Palliser
be
so
minded
;
but
he
talk
to
him
very
little
about
politic
.
<EOS>
nor
during
the
whole
time
of
his
stay
at
Matching
do
the
Duke
make
any
other
allusion
to
Mr.
Palliser
's
hope
as
regard
the
ministry
,
than
that
in
which
he
have
tell
Lady
Glencora
at
the
dinner
-
table
that
her
husband
's
ambition
be
the
high
by
which
any
man
could
be
move
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Bott
be
sometimes
honour
by
a
few
word
with
the
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
muster
pretty
strong
,
your
grace
,
"
Mr.
Bott
have
say
to
him
one
day
before
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
depend
on
how
the
change
go
,
"
say
the
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
there
will
be
a
change
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
;
there
will
be
a
change
,
 
certainly
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
and
it
will
be
in
your
direction
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
in
Palliser
's
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
should
think
so
;
 
that
is
,
if
it
suit
him
.
<EOS>
by
-
the
-
by
,
Mr.
Bott
 
<EOS>
"
then
there
be
a
little
whisper
communication
,
in
which
perhaps
Mr.
Bott
be
undertake
some
commission
of
that
nature
which
Lady
Glencora
have
call
"
tell
.
"
   
<EOS>
in
which
much
of
the
history
of
the
Pallisers
be
tell
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
ten
day
Alice
find
herself
quite
comfortable
at
Matching
Priory
.
<EOS>
She
have
now
promise
to
remain
there
till
the
second
week
of
December
,
at
which
time
she
be
to
go
to
Vavasor
Hall
,
 
there
to
meet
her
father
and
Kate
.
<EOS>
the
Pallisers
be
to
pass
their
Christmas
with
the
Duke
of
Omnium
in
Barsetshire
.
<EOS>
"
We
always
be
to
do
that
,
"
say
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
state
occasion
at
Gatherum
Castle
,
but
it
only
last
for
one
week
.
<EOS>
then
we
go
somewhere
else

<EOS>
oh
dear
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
say
"
oh

<EOS>

"
because
 
;
I
do
not
think
I
mean
to
tell
you

then
I
be
sure
I
will
not
ask
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
so
like
you
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
be
as
firm
as
you
,
and
I
be
sure
I
will
not
tell
you
unless
you
do
ask
.
<EOS>
"
but
Alice
do
not
ask
,
and
it
be
not
long
before
Lady
Glencora
's
firmness
give
way
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
have
say
,
Alice
have
become
quite
comfortable
at
Matching
Priory
.
<EOS>
perhaps
she
be
already
grow
upwards
towards
the
light
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
she
could
listen
with
pleasure
to
the
few
word
the
Duke
would
say
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
even
chat
a
little
to
the
Duchess
,
 
so
that
her
grace
have
observe
to
Lady
Glencora
that
"
her
cousin
be
a
very
nice
person
,
 
a
very
nice
person
indeed
.
<EOS>
what
a
pity
it
be
that
she
have
be
so
ill
-
treat
by
that
gentleman
in
Oxfordshire
!
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
have
to
explain
that
the
gentleman
live
in
Cambridgeshire
,
and
that
he
,
at
any
rate
,
have
not
treat
anybody
ill
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
mean
that
she
 
jilt
him
?
"
say
the
Duchess
,
almost
whistle
,
and
open
her
eye
very
wide
.
<EOS>
"
dear
me
,
I
be
sorry
for
that
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
think
it
.
"
<EOS>
and
when
she
next
speak
to
Alice
she
assume
rather
a
severe
tone
of
emphasis
;
 
but
this
be
soon
abandon
when
Alice
listen
to
her
with
complacency
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
also
have
learn
to
ride
,
 
or
rather
have
resume
her
riding
,
which
for
year
have
be
abandon
.
<EOS>
Jeffrey
Palliser
have
be
her
squire
,
and
she
have
become
intimate
with
him
so
as
to
learn
to
quarrel
with
him
and
to
like
him
,
 
to
such
an
extent
that
Lady
Glencora
have
laughingly
tell
her
that
she
be
go
to
do
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
rather
think
not
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
have
think
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
who
ever
think
about
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
just
at
present
,
 
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
upon
my
word
it
would
be
very
nice
;
 
and
then
perhaps
some
day
you
would
be
the
Duchess
.
"
  
"
Glencora
,
do
not
talk
such
nonsense
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
those
be
the
speculation
which
people
make
.
<EOS>
only
I
should
spite
you
by
kill
myself
,
so
that
he
may
marry
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
say
such
horrid
thing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
shall
,
 
some
day
.
<EOS>
what
right
have
I
to
stand
in
his
way
?
<EOS>
He
speak
to
me
the
other
day
about
Jeffrey
's
altered
position
,
and
I
know
what
he
mean
;
 
or
rather
what
he
do
not
mean
to
say
,
but
what
he
think
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
not
kill
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
know
one
other
way
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
think
of
thing
which
should
never
be
in
your
thought
,
"
say
Alice
vehemently
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
you
no
trust
in
God
's
providence
?
<EOS>
can
not
you
accept
what
have
be
do
for
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
have
go
away
,
much
to
Lady
Glencora
's
delight
,
but
have
unfortunately
come
back
again
.
<EOS>
on
his
return
Alice
hear
more
of
the
feud
between
the
Duchess
and
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
tell
you
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
to
her
friend
;
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
tell
you
before
he
go
that
I
be
right
about
his
tale
-
bearing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
he
bear
tale
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
do
get
the
scolding
,
and
I
know
very
well
that
it
come
through
him
,
though
Mr.
Palliser
do
not
say
so
.
<EOS>
but
he
tell
me
that
the
Duchess
have
feel
herself
hurt
by
that
other
woman
's
way
of
talk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
not
your
fault
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
that
be
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
It
be
he
who
desire
me
to
ask
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
to
come
here
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
her
.
<EOS>
She
go
everywhere
,
and
it
be
think
a
catch
to
get
her
;
but
if
she
have
be
drown
in
the
Red
Sea
I
should
not
have
mind
.
<EOS>
when
I
tell
him
that
,
he
say
it
be
nonsense
,
 
which
of
course
it
be
;
and
then
he
say
I
ought
to
make
her
hold
her
tongue
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
say
I
could
not
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
would
not
care
for
me
.
<EOS>
if
she
quiz
me
,
myself
,
I
tell
him
that
I
could
take
care
of
myself
,
though
she
be
ten
time
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
,
and
have
write
fine
poetry
than
Tennyson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
fine
;
 
some
of
it
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
dare
say
!
<EOS>
I
know
a
great
deal
of
it
by
heart
,
only
I
would
not
give
her
the
pleasure
of
supposing
that
I
have
ever
think
so
much
about
her
poetry
.
<EOS>
and
then
I
tell
him
that
I
could
not
take
care
of
the
Duchess
,
 
and
he
tell
me
that
I
be
a
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
only
mean
that
in
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
a
child
;
I
know
that
.
<EOS>
why
do
not
he
marry
some
strong
-
minded
,
ferocious
woman
that
could
keep
his
house
in
order
,
and
frown
Mrs.
Sparkes
out
of
her
impudence
?
<EOS>
It
be
not
my
fault
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
tell
him
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
.
<EOS>
then
he
kiss
me
,
and
say
it
be
all
right
,
and
tell
me
that
I
should
grow
old
.
"
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Sparkes
will
grow
more
impudent
,
"
I
say
,
"
and
the
Duchess
more
silly
.
"
<EOS>
and
after
that
I
go
away
.
<EOS>
now
this
horrid
Mr.
Bott
have
come
back
again
,
and
only
that
it
would
be
mean
in
me
to
condescend
so
far
,
I
would
punish
him
.
<EOS>
He
grin
and
smile
at
me
,
and
rub
his
big
hand
more
than
ever
,
because
he
feel
that
he
have
behave
badly
.
<EOS>
be
it
not
horrid
to
have
to
live
in
the
house
with
such
people
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
you
need
mind
him
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
but
I
be
the
mistress
here
,
and
be
tell
that
I
be
to
entertain
the
people
.
<EOS>
fancy
entertain
the
Duchess
of
St.
Bungay
and
Mr.
Bott
!
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
have
now
become
so
intimate
with
Lady
Glencora
that
she
do
not
scruple
to
read
her
wise
lecture
,
 
tell
her
that
she
allow
herself
to
think
too
much
of
little
thing
,
 
and
too
much
also
of
some
big
thing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
regard
Mr.
Bott
,
"
say
Alice
,
"
I
think
you
should
bear
it
as
though
there
be
no
such
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
that
would
be
pretence
,
 
especially
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
it
would
not
be
pretence
;
it
would
be
the
reticence
which
all
woman
should
practise
,
 
and
you
,
in
your
position
,
more
almost
than
any
other
woman
.
"
<EOS>
then
Lady
Glencora
pout
,
tell
Alice
that
it
be
a
pity
she
have
not
marry
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
leave
her
.
  
<EOS>
that
evening
,
 
the
evening
of
Mr.
Bott
's
return
to
Matching
,
that
gentleman
find
a
place
near
to
Alice
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
He
have
often
come
up
to
her
,
rub
his
hand
together
,
and
say
little
word
,
as
though
there
be
some
reason
from
their
position
that
they
two
should
be
friend
.
<EOS>
Alice
have
perceive
this
,
and
have
endeavour
with
all
her
force
to
shake
him
off
;
but
he
be
a
man
,
who
if
he
understand
a
hint
,
never
take
it
.
<EOS>
a
cold
shoulder
be
nothing
to
him
,
if
he
want
to
gain
the
person
who
show
it
him
.
<EOS>
His
code
of
perseverance
teach
him
that
it
be
a
virtue
to
overcome
cold
shoulder
.
<EOS>
the
man
or
woman
who
receive
his
first
overture
with
grace
would
probably
be
one
on
whom
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
look
down
and
waste
no
further
time
;
whereas
he
or
she
who
could
afford
to
treat
him
with
disdain
would
no
doubt
be
worth
gain
.
<EOS>
such
man
as
Mr.
Bott
be
ever
gracious
to
cold
shoulder
.
<EOS>
the
cold
the
shoulder
,
the
more
gracious
be
the
Mr.
Botts
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
delightful
person
be
our
dear
friend
,
Lady
Glencora
!
"
say
Mr.
Bott
,
have
catch
Alice
in
a
position
from
which
she
could
not
readily
escape
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
have
half
a
mind
to
differ
,
or
to
make
any
remark
that
may
rid
her
from
Mr.
Bott
.
<EOS>
but
she
do
not
dare
to
say
a
word
that
may
seem
to
have
be
say
playfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
indeed
,
"
she
reply
.
<EOS>
"
how
very
cold
it
be
to
-
night
!
"
<EOS>
She
be
angry
with
herself
for
her
own
stupidity
as
soon
as
the
phrase
be
out
of
her
mouth
,
and
then
she
almost
laugh
as
she
think
of
the
Duchess
and
the
hot
-
water
pipe
at
Longroyston
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
it
be
cold
.
<EOS>
You
and
her
ladyship
be
great
friend
,
I
believe
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
She
be
my
cousin
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
yes
;
that
be
so
pleasant
.
<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
know
that
Mr.
Palliser
be
very
much
gratified
that
you
should
be
so
much
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
unbearable
.
<EOS>
Alice
could
not
quite
assume
sufficient
courage
to
get
up
from
her
chair
and
walk
away
from
him
,
and
yet
she
feel
that
she
must
escape
further
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
I
be
very
much
with
her
,
and
if
I
be
I
can
not
think
it
would
make
any
difference
to
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Bott
be
not
a
man
to
be
put
down
when
he
have
a
purpose
in
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
assure
you
that
those
be
his
sentiment
.
<EOS>
of
course
we
all
know
that
dear
Lady
Glencora
be
young
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
young
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Bott
,
I
really
would
rather
not
talk
about
my
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
dear
Miss
Vavasor
;
 
when
we
both
have
her
welfare
in
view
 
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
her
welfare
in
view
,
Mr.
Bott
;
not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
reason
why
I
should
.
<EOS>
You
must
excuse
me
if
I
say
I
can
not
talk
about
her
welfare
with
a
perfect
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
then
she
do
get
up
,
and
go
away
from
the
Member
of
Parliament
,
leave
him
rather
astonish
at
her
audacity
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
a
constant
man
,
and
his
inner
resolve
be
simply
to
the
effect
that
he
would
try
it
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
Jeffrey
Palliser
do
think
much
of
the
difference
between
his
present
position
and
that
which
would
have
be
his
have
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
be
the
happy
possessor
of
a
cradle
up
-
stair
with
a
boy
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
must
have
do
so
.
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
possible
that
any
man
should
not
be
alive
to
the
importance
of
such
a
chance
.
<EOS>
His
own
present
position
be
one
of
the
most
unfortunate
which
can
fall
to
the
lot
of
a
man
.
<EOS>
His
father
,
the
Duke
's
young
brother
,
have
leave
him
about
six
hundred
a
year
,
and
have
leave
him
also
a
taste
for
live
with
people
of
six
thousand
.
<EOS>
the
propriety
of
earn
his
bread
have
never
be
put
before
him
.
<EOS>
His
father
have
be
in
Parliament
,
and
have
be
the
most
favoured
son
of
the
old
Duke
,
who
for
some
year
before
his
death
have
never
speak
to
him
who
now
reign
over
the
house
of
the
Pallisers
.
<EOS>
Jeffrey
's
father
have
be
bring
up
at
Matching
Priory
as
scion
of
ducal
house
be
bring
up
,
and
on
the
old
man
's
death
have
be
possess
of
mean
sufficient
to
go
on
in
the
same
path
,
though
with
difficulty
.
<EOS>
His
brother
have
do
something
for
him
,
and
at
various
time
he
have
hold
some
place
near
the
throne
.
<EOS>
but
on
his
death
,
when
the
property
leave
behind
him
be
divide
between
his
son
and
three
daughter
,
Jeffrey
Palliser
become
possess
of
the
income
above
state
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
could
live
on
it
,
 
and
as
during
the
winter
month
of
the
year
a
home
be
find
for
him
free
of
cost
,
he
could
keep
hunter
,
and
live
as
rich
man
live
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
a
poor
,
embarrassed
man
,
without
prospect
,
 
until
this
fine
ducal
prospect
become
open
to
him
by
the
want
of
that
cradle
at
Matching
Priory
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
prospect
be
no
doubt
very
distant
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
may
yet
have
as
many
son
as
Hecuba
.
<EOS>
or
she
may
die
,
and
some
other
more
fortunate
lady
may
become
the
mother
of
his
cousin
's
heir
.
<EOS>
or
the
Duke
may
marry
and
have
a
son
.
<EOS>
and
,
moreover
,
his
cousin
be
only
one
year
old
than
himself
,
and
the
great
prize
,
if
it
come
his
way
,
may
not
come
for
forty
year
as
yet
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
his
hand
may
now
be
acceptable
in
quarter
where
it
would
certainly
be
reject
have
Lady
Glencora
possess
that
cradle
up
-
stair
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
but
suppose
that
he
must
have
make
some
calculation
of
this
nature
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pity
you
should
do
nothing
all
your
life
,
"
his
cousin
Plantagenet
say
to
him
one
morning
just
at
this
time
.
<EOS>
Jeffrey
have
seek
the
interview
in
his
cousin
's
room
,
and
I
fear
have
do
so
with
some
slight
request
for
ready
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
I
to
do
?
"
say
Jeffrey
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
any
rate
you
may
marry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
 
I
could
marry
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
man
so
poor
but
what
he
can
do
that
.
<EOS>
the
question
would
be
how
I
may
like
the
subsequent
starvation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
that
you
need
starve
.
<EOS>
though
your
own
fortune
be
small
,
it
be
something
,
 
and
many
girl
have
fortune
of
their
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jeffrey
think
of
Lady
Glencora
,
but
he
make
no
allusion
to
her
in
speech
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
I
be
very
good
at
that
kind
of
thing
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
when
the
father
and
mother
come
to
ask
of
my
house
and
my
home
<EOS>
I
should
break
down
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
it
as
praise
myself
;
 
indeed
,
quite
the
reverse
;
but
I
fear
I
have
not
a
mercenary
tendency

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
nonsense

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes

quite
so

<EOS>
I
admit
that

man
must
have
mercenary
tendency

they
would
not
have
bread

<EOS>
the
man
who
plough
that
he
may
live
do
so
because
he
,
luckily
,
have
a
mercenary
tendency
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
just
so
.
<EOS>
but
you
see
I
be
less
lucky
than
the
ploughman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
vulgar
error
so
vulgar
,
 
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
common
or
erroneous
,
as
that
by
which
man
have
be
teach
to

bad

<EOS>
a
desire
for
wealth
be
the
source
of
all
progress

<EOS>
civilization
come
from
what
man
call
greed

let
your

combine
with
honesty

they
can
not
take
you
astray

of

air

tone
of
wisdom
which
a
Chancellor

I

not

any

"
Would
you
like

occupy
a

in

yes

old

have
you
no

not
much

would
have
to

farmer
there

<EOS>
"
no

I
should
not

I
should
get
up
an
opposition

off

that
do
very
well

Jeffrey
,
if
a

can
get
into

capital
enough
to
wait
;

I
do
not

do
out
there

Would
you
like
to
go
into

<EOS>
"
what
;
here
?
<EOS>
of
course
I
should
.
<EOS>
only
I
should
be
sure

terribly

<EOS>
I
do
not

no

You

it
may
be
that

in
short

<EOS>
Hereupon
Jeffrey
mutter
something
as
to
the
small
probability
of
such
necessity
,

as
to
the
great
remoteness

any
result
even
if
it

so

that
be
all
true

heir

still
 
.

in
short
,
I
wish
you
would

something

you

about
it

some

speak

again

"
  
<EOS>
Jeffrey
,
as
he
leave
his
cousin
with
a
cheque
for
£
500
in
his
waist
-
coat
pocket
,
think
that
the
interview
which
have
at
one
time
take
important
dimension
,
have
not
be
conclude
altogether
satisfactorily
.
<EOS>
a
seat
in
Parliament
!
<EOS>
yes
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
if
his
cousin
would
so
far
use
his
political
,
monetary
,
or
ducal
interest
as
to
do
that
for
him
;
 
as
to
give
him
something
of
the
status
properly
belong
to
the
young
son
of
the
House
,
then
indeed
life
would
have
some
charm
for
him
!
<EOS>
but
as
for
the
farm
in
Scotland
,
or
a
desk
at
an
office
in
London
,
 
his
own
New
Zealand
plan
would
be
well
than
those
.
<EOS>
and
then
as
he
go
along
of
course
he
bethink
himself
that
it
may
be
his
lot
yet
to
die
,
and
at
least
to
be
bury
,
in
the
purple
,
as
a
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
if
so
,
certainly
it
would
be
his
duty
to
prepare
another
heir
,
and
leave
a
duke
behind
him
,
 
if
it
be
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
go
to
ride
with
us
after
lunch
?
"
say
Lady
Glencora
to
him
as
he
stroll
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Jeffrey
;
"
I
be
go
to
study
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
to
do
what
?
"

Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
study
;
 
or
rather
I
shall
spend
to
-
day
in
sit
down
and
consider
what
I
will
study
.
<EOS>
My
cousin
have
just
be
tell
me
that
I
ought
to
do
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
you
ought

say
Iphigenia
energetically
from
her
writing

desk
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
he
do
not
seem
to
have
any
clear
opinion
what
it
ought
to
be

<EOS>
You
see
there
can
not
be
two
chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sparkes
,
what
ought
a
young
man
like
me
to
set
about
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
go
into
Parliament
,
I
should
say
,
"
say
Mrs.
Sparkes
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
yes
;
exactly
.
<EOS>
He
have
some
notion
of
that
kind
,
too
,
but
he
do
not
name
any
particular
place
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
will
try
the
City
of
London
.
<EOS>
They
have
four
there
,
and
of
course
the
chance
of
get
in
would
thereby
be
double
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
commercial
man
be
generally
prefer
in
the
City
,
"
say
the
Duchess
,
take
a
strong
and
good
-
natured
interest
in
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Palliser
mean
to
make
a
fortune
in
trade
as
a
preliminary
,
"
say
Mrs.
Sparkes
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
he
mean
anything
of
the
kind
,
"
say
the
Duchess
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
any
rate
I
have
get
to
do
something
,
so
I
can
not
go
and
ride
,
"
say
Jeffrey
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
ought
to
do
something
,
"
say
Iphigenia
from
her
desk
.
  
<EOS>
twice
during
this
little
conversation
Lady
Glencora
have
look
up
,
catch
Alice
's
eye
,
and
Alice
have
well
know
what
she
have
mean
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
the
glance
have
say
,
"
Plantagenet
be
begin
to
take
an
interest
in
his
cousin
,
and
you
know
why
.
<EOS>
the
man
who
be
to
be
the
father
of
the
future
duke
must
not
be
allow
to
fritter
away
his
time
in
obscurity
.
<EOS>
have
I
that
cradle
up

stair
Jeffrey
may
be
as
idle
as
he
please
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
understand
it
well
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
Jeffrey
do
join
the
ride
party
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
a
man
like
me
to
do
who
want
to
do
something
?

he
say
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
Alice
be
quite
aware
that
Lady
Glencora
have
contrive
some
little
scheme
that
Mr.
Palliser
should
be
ride
next
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
like
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
therefore
have
no
objection
;
but
she
declare
to
herself
that
her
cousin
be
a
goose
for
her
pain

"
Mrs.
Sparkes
say
you
ought
to
go
into
Parliament

<EOS>
"
yes
;

the
dear
Duchess
would
perhaps
suggest
a
house
in
Belgrave
Square

I
want
to
hear
your
advice
now

can
only
say
ditto
to
Miss
Palliser

what
!

iphy
?
<EOS>
about
procrastination

more
of

the
well

a
very
good
thing
too

I
be
sure

Alice

only
it
depend
something
on
the
sort
of
wife
you
get

mean
,
of
course
,
how
much
money
she
have

"
not
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
look
at
it
from
my
cousin
's
point
of
view
,
I
suppose
that
it
be
the
only
important
point

<EOS>
who
be
there
come
up
this
year
,
 
in
the
way
of
heiress
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
I
do
not
know

<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
how
much
money
make
an
heiress
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
for
such
a
fellow
as
me
,
I
suppose
ten
thousand
pound
ought
to
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
not
much
,
"
say
Alice
,
who
have
exactly
that
amount
of
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
 
;
perhaps
that
be
too
moderate
.
<EOS>
but
the
low
one
go
in
the
money
speculation
,
the
great
would
be
the
number
to
choose
from
,
and
the
well
the
chance
of
get
something
decent
in
the
woman
herself
.
<EOS>
I
have
something
of
my
own
,
 
not
much
you
know
;
so
with
the
lady
's
ten
thousand
pound
we
may
be
able
to
live
,
 
in
some
second
-
rate
french
town
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
not
see
what
you
would
gain
by
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
people
here
would
have
get
rid
of
me

that
seem
to
be
the
great
thing

if
you
hear
of
any
girl
with
about
that
sum
,
moderately
good
-
look
,
not
too
young
so
that
she
may
know
something
of
the
world
,
decently
bear
,
and
able
to
read

write
,
perhaps
you
will
bear
me
in
mind

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
will
,

say
Alice
,
who
be
quite
aware
that
he
have
make
an
accurate
picture
of
her
own
position
.

when
I
meet
such
a
one
,
I
will
send
for
you
at
once

You
know
no

now

well

no

at

I
declare

do

could
do
anything
well

her
cousin
say
to
her
that
night
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
be
now
in
the
habit
of
have
Alice
with
her
in
what
she
call
her
dressing
-
room
every
evening
,
and
then
they
would
sit
till
the
small
hour
come
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
always
burn
the
midnight
oil
and
come
to
bed
with
the
owl
.
<EOS>
They
would
often
talk
of
him
and
his
prospect
till
Alice
have
perhaps
inspire
his
wife
with
more
of
interest
in
him
and
them
than
she
have
before
feel
.
<EOS>
and
Alice
have
manage
generally
to
drive
her
friend
away
from
those
topic
which
be
so
dangerous
,
 
those
allusion
to
her
childlessness
,
and
those
hint
that
Burgo
Fitzgerald
be
still
in
her
thought
.
<EOS>
and
sometimes
,
of
course
,
they
have
speak
of
Alice
's
own
prospect
,
till
she
get
into
a
way
of
tell
her
cousin
freely
all
that
she
feel
.
<EOS>
on
such
occasion
Lady
Glencora
would
always
tell
her
that
she
have
be
right
,
 
if
she
do
not
love
the
man
.
"
<EOS>
though
your
finger
be
put
out
for
the
ring
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
on
one
such
occasion
,
"
you
should
go
back
,
if
you
do
not
love
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
love
him
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
do
not
understand
it
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
;
and
,
in
truth
,
close
as
be
their
intimacy
,
they
do
not
perfectly
understand
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
but
on
this
occasion
they
be
speak
of
Jeffrey
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
I
declare
I
do
not
think
he
could
do
any
well
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
talk
such
nonsense
,
I
will
not
stay
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
should
it
be
nonsense
?
<EOS>
You
would
be
very
comfortable
with
your
joint
income
.
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
the
good
fellow
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
be
clear
that
he
like
you
;
and
then
we
should
be
so
near
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
Mr.
Palliser
would
do
something
for
him
if
he
marry
,
 
and
especially
if
I
ask

two

what
be
they

"
  
<EOS>
"
that
he

that
I
would
not
take
him
for

why
not

what

you

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
dislike
him
at
all

I
like
him
very
much
indeed

one
can
not
marry
all
the
people
one
like

<EOS>
"
but
what
reason
be
there
why
you
should
not
marry
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
chiefly
,
"
say
Alice
,
after
a
pause
;
"
that
I
have
just
separate
myself
from
a
man
whom
I
certainly
do
love
truly
,
and
that
I
can
not
transfer
my
affection
quite
so
quickly
as
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
word
be
out
of
her
mouth
she
know
that
they
should
not
have
be
speak
.
<EOS>
It
be
exactly
what
Glencora
have
do
.
<EOS>
She
have
love
a
man
and
have
separate
herself
from
him
and
have
marry
another
all
within
a
month
or
two
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
first
become
red
as
fire
over
her
whole
face
and
shoulder
,
and
Alice
afterwards
do
the
same
as
she
look
up
,
as
though
search
in
her
cousin
's
eye
for
pardon
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
an
unmaidenly
thing
to
do

certainly

say
Lady
Glencora
very
slowly
,

in
her
low
voice
.
"
<EOS>
nay
,
it
be
unwomanly
;

one
may
be
drive

one
may

so
drive

drive
out

oh
,
Glencora

I
do
do
it
suddenly

I
do
it
like

if
you

I
have
learn
to

so
dearly

then
you
be

only

can
not

it
possible

You

another

there

you

It
be
impossible

<EOS>
I
have
never

a

to
him

could
make
him

<EOS>
I
have
never
do
a
thing
for
him
that
can
make
him
love
me

<EOS>
the
mother
of
his

he
may
have
love

because
of
that

why
should
he
love
me

<EOS>
We
be
tell
to
marry
each
other

do
it

<EOS>
when
could
he
have
learn

,
Alice

he
require
no

either
to
take

I

Alice

of
little

at

Glencora

You

<EOS>
a
week
or
ten
day
after
this
,
Alice
,
when
she
come
down
to
the
breakfast
-
parlour
one
morning
,
find
herself
alone
with
Mr.
Bott

<EOS>
It
be
the
fashion
at
Matching
Priory
for
people
to
assemble
rather
late
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
the
nominal
hour
for
breakfast
be
ten
,
and
none
of
the
lady
of
the
party
be
ever
see
before
that
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
gentleman
would
breakfast
earlier
,
especially
on
hunt
morning
;
and
on
some
occasion
the
lady
,
when
they
come
together
,
would
find
themselves
altogether
desert
by
their
husband
and
brother
.
<EOS>
on
this
day
it
be
fate
that
Mr.
Bott
alone
should
represent
the
sterner
sex
,
and
when
Alice
enter
the
room
he
be
stand
on
the
rug
with
his
back
to
the
fire
,
wait
till
the
appearance
of
some
other
guest
should
give
him
the
sanction
necessary
for
the
commencement
of
his
morning
meal
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
when
she
see
him
,
would
have
retreat
have
it
be
possible
,
for
she
have
learn
to
dislike
him
greatly
,
and
be
,
indeed
,
almost
afraid
of
him
;
but
she
could
not
do
so
without
make
her
flight
too
conspicuous
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
intend
to
prolong
your
stay
here
,
Miss
Vavasor

say
Mr.

take
advantage
of
the
first
moment
at
which
she
look
up
from
a
letter

she
be
read

"
for
a
few
more

<EOS>
"
ah
 
I
be
glad
of

away
sooner

"
You
must
find

must
give

take

as

make
no

continue
 
<EOS>

I
always

never

any

I
always
say
to

nothing
can

I
do

do

drive

do
not

I
can
serve
my

better

keep
in
the

boat
with
him

as
long
as
it
will
hold

I
will
make

I

I
rather

I
know

no

Mr.

be
not

certainly
not

there
be
occasion

occasion

somewhat
elastic

I

Our

of

be
political

it
have
extend
beyond

pleasantly
social

very
pleasantly
social

I
need
not

very

with
all
the

resistance
at

She
frown
too

look
savagely

she
want

her
confusion
be
at

could
see

that
the
new
trouble

though
it
may
be
vexatious

be
no
great
calamity

"

come
here

It

take
me
away
three
day
earlier

"
  
<EOS>
upon
hear
this
Mr.
Palliser
look
very
serious
.
<EOS>
what
quarrel
could
miss
Vavasor
have
have
with
Lady
Midlothian
which
should
make
it
impossible
for
them
to
be
visitor
at
the
same
house
?
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
do
no
such
thing
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
be
coward
enough
to
run
away
from
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
,
Miss
Vavasor
,
that
we
can
hardly
bid
her
not
come
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
in
answer
to
this
,
Alice
protest
that
she
would
not
for
world
have
be
the
mean
of
keep
Lady
Midlothian
away
from
match
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
tell
you
,
Mr.
Palliser
,
that
I
have
never
see
Lady
Midlothian
,
though
she
be
my
far
-
away
cousin
.
<EOS>
nor
have
I
ever
quarrel
with
her
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
give
me
advice
by
letter
,
and
I
do
not
answer
her
because
I
think
she
have
no
business
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
away
,
not
because
I
be
afraid
of
her
,
but
because
,
after
what
have
pass
,
our
meeting
would
be
unpleasant
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
could
tell
her
that
Miss
Vavasor
be
here
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
then
she
nee
not
come
unless
she
please

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
matter
be
so
manage
at
last
that
Alice
find
herself
unable
to
leave
Matching
without
make
more
of
Lady
Midlothian
be
come
than
it
be
worth
.
<EOS>
It
would
undoubtedly
be
very
disagreeable
,
 
this
unexpected
meeting
with
her
relative
;
but
,
as
Lady
Glencora
say
,
Lady
Midlothian
would
not
eat
her
.
<EOS>
in
truth
,
she
feel
ashamed
of
herself
in
that
she
be
afraid
of
her
relative
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
she
be
afraid
of
her
.
<EOS>
so
much
she
be
force
to
admit
to
herself
.
<EOS>
but
she
resolve
at
last
that
she
would
not
let
her
drive
her
out
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
Mr.
Bott
an
admirer
of
your
cousin
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sparkes
say
that
evening
to
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
very
distant
one
I
should
think
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
goodness
gracious
!
<EOS>
"
exclaim
an
old
lady
who
have
be
rather
awe
by
Alice
's
intimacy
and
cousinship
with
Lady
Glencora
;
"
it
be
the
very
last
thing
I
should
have
dreamt
of

I
do
not

first

last
,
"

Mrs.

<EOS>
"
why
do
you
ask
?
"

Lady

<EOS>
"
do
not

that
I

whether
Miss
Vavasor

an
admirer
of
his
,
"
say
Mrs.
Sparkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
suspicion
of
that
nature

<EOS>
I
rather
think
that
when

play
Bacchus
she
play
Ariadne
,
with
full
intention
of
fly
from
him
in
earnest
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
be
Mr.
Bott
incline
to
play
Bacchus
?
"
ask
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
rather
think
he
be
this
morning
.
<EOS>
if
you
observe
,
he
have
something
of
a
godlike
and
triumphant
air
about
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
his
godship
will
triumph
there
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
think
she
would
be
throw
herself
very
much
away
,

the
old
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Vavasor
be
not
at
all
dispose
to
do
that

"
say
Mrs.
Sparkes

<EOS>
then
that
conversation
be
allow
to
drop
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
follow
Monday
,
Lady

.
<EOS>
the
carriage
be
send
to
meet
her
at
the
station
about
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
and
Alice
have
to
choose
whether
she
would
undergo
her
first
introduction
immediately
on
her
relative
's
arrival
,
or
whether
she
would
keep
herself
out
of
the
way
till
she
should
meet
her
in
the
drawing
-
room
before
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
receive
her
when
she
come
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
"
and
of
course
will
tell
her
that
you
be
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
,
that
will
be
good
;
and
 
;
dear
me
,
I
declare
I
do
not
know
how
to
manage
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
bring
her
to
you
in
my
room
if
you
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
that
would
be
too
solemn
,
"
say
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
that
would
make
her
understand
that
I
think
a
great
deal
about
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
we
will
let
thing
take
their
chance
,
and
you
shall
come
across
her
just
as
you
would

stranger

<EOS>
"
It
be
settle
at
last
that
this
would
be
the
well
course
,
but
that
Lady
Midlothian
be
to
be
inform
of
Alice
's
presence
at
the
Priory
as
soon
as
she
should

<EOS>
Alice

<EOS>
and

<EOS>
She

between
sixty
and
seventy

<EOS>
at
present
she
make
no
pretension
either
to
youth
or
beauty

as
some

"
<EOS>
Your

I

an

have
have

so
far
as
that
be
concern
,
much
cause
of
sorrow

but
she
do
not
say
so
.
<EOS>
She
be
think
altogether
of
Lady
Midlothian
's
letter
to
her
,
and
try
to
calculate
whether
or
no
it
would
be
well
for
her
to
rush
away
at
once
to
the
subject
.
<EOS>
that
Lady
Midlothian
would
mention
the
letter
,
Alice
feel
well
assured
;
and
when
could
it
be
better
mention
than
now
,
in
Glencora
's
presence
,
 
when
no
other
person
be
near
them
to
listen
to
her

<EOS>
"
You

I

feeling
,
however

as
she
speak
,
that
the
strength
of
her
resistance
to
the
old

be
begin
to
give
way

<EOS>
"
no

my

that
be
to
my
thinking
another
reason
why

Lady
Macleod

something
in

perhaps

rather

grey
eye

therefore
it
be
so
very
necessary

Alice

to

would
much

to
abandon

she
have
feel

it
would
be
cowardly
in

to
desert
Lady

<EOS>
there
have
not
arise
any

close

with
his
wife

She
would
have
wish

justify
this

confidence

almost
sure
that
Mr.

expect
her
to
do
so
in
this
instance

<EOS>
She
do
say
a
word

two

<EOS>
after

She
be
afraid
to
do
so

she
be
also
become
a

afraid

afraid

be
drive
some

either
to
throw

have
think
better

<EOS>
what
she
have
now
say
strike
Alice
as
be
vulgar
,
 
as
be
premeditate
vulgarity

her
annoyance
be
excessive

<EOS>
of
course
Mr.
Palliser
would
think
that
she
be
a
consent

make
to
him

"
go

<EOS>
no

go
on

there
can
be

do

Alice

think
of
this

whom
will
you
meet

would
suit
you
better

you
need
not
decide
now

You
need
not

a
word

leave
me
to
tell
him
,
that
if
it
be
to
be

at
all

it
can
not

different
from
any

It
make
you

up
tight

it

go
into

tell

wonder

annoyance

you

overcome

It
suit
me
that
we
should
go
to
Monkshade

it
do
not
suit
me
that
there
should
be
any
one

you
be
afraid
to
meet

Could
I
tell
him

here

know
what

loathe

I
loathe
the
thing
that
I

I
could
have
cling
to
the
outside

his
very
trapping

love
him
ten
time
well

myself

ill

treat
me

there
would
have
be
something
leave

win
even

with

what
be
I
to

<EOS>
Alice
have
no
doubt
as
to
what
her
cousin
should
do

<EOS>
She
should
be
true
to
her
marriage
-
vow
,
whether
that
vow
when
make
be
true
or
false
.
<EOS>
She
should
be
true
to
it
as
far
as
truth
would
now
carry
her
.
<EOS>
and
in
order
that
she
may
be
true
,
she
should
tell
her
husband
as
much
as
may
be
necessary
to
induce
him
to
spare
her
the
threaten
visit
to
Monkshade
.
<EOS>
all
that
she
say
to
Lady
Glencora
,
as
they
walk
slowly
across
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Glencora
be
more
occupied
with
her
own
thought
than
with
her
friend
's
advice
.
<EOS>
"
here
be
Jeffrey
!
"
<EOS>
she
say

<EOS>
"
what
an
unconscionable
time
we
have
keep
him

"
  
<EOS>
"
do
not

he
say

I

Lady
Glencora

now
we
will
go
round

long

frighten
those
two
delicious
old
duenna

<EOS>
these
last
word
be
say
as
it
be
in
a
whisper
to
Alice

they
be
so
whisper

there
be
no
real

keep
them
from
the
ear
of

Glencora

Alice
think

should
not

allow
the
word
duenna
to
have
pass
her
lip
in
speak
to
any
one
;
but
,
above
all
,
she
should
not
have
do
so
in
the
hearing
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
cousin

They
walk
<EOS>
all
round
the
ruin

on
a
raise
gravel

path

have
be
make
there

and
Alice
,
who
could
hardly
bring
herself
to
speak
,
 
so
full
be
her
mind
of
that
which
have
just
be
say
to
her
,
 
be
surprised
to
find
that
Glencora
could
go
on

in
her
usual
light
humour
,
chat
as
though
there
be
no
weight
within
her
to
depress
her
spirit

Alice
leave

to
remain
so
long
.
"
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Palliser
turn
away
,
and
walk
his
wife
off
,
take
no
notice
whatsoever
of
Miss
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
feel
the
slight
,
and
understand
it
all
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
her
plainly
enough
,
though
not
in
word
,
that
he
have
trust
his
wife
with
her
,
and
that
she
have
betray
the
trust
.
<EOS>
She
may
have
bring
Glencora
in
within
five
or
six
minute
,
instead
of
allow
her
to
remain
out
there
in
the
freezing
night
air
for
nearly
three
-
quarter
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
accusation
which
Mr.
Palliser
make
against
her
,
and
he
make
it
with
the
utmost
severity
.
<EOS>
He
ask
no
question
of
her
whether
she
be
cold
.
<EOS>
He
speak
no
word
to
her
,
nor
do
he
even
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
She
may
get
herself
away
to
her
bedroom
as
she
please
.
<EOS>
Alice
understand
all
this
completely
,
and
though
she
know
that
she
have
not
deserve
such
severity
,
she
be
not
incline
to
resent
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
so
much
in
Mr.
Palliser
's
position
that
be
to
be
pity
,
that
Alice
could
not
find
it
in
her
heart
to
be
angry
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
provoke
with
us
,
now
,
"
say
Jeffrey
Palliser
,
stand
with
her
for
a
moment
in
the
billiard
-
room
,
as
he
hand
her
a
candle
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
afraid
that
she
will
have
catch
cold
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
and
he
think
it
wrong
that
she
should
remain
out
at
night
so
long
.
<EOS>
You
can
easily
understand
,
Miss
Vavasor
,
that
he
have
not
much
sympathy
for
romance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
he
be
right
,
"
say
Alice
,
not
exactly
know
what
to
say
,
and
not
be
able
to
forget
what
have
be
say
about
herself
and
Jeffrey
Palliser
when
they
first
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
romance
usually
mean
nonsense

I
believe

that
be
not
Glencora

doctrine

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

no

she
be
young
than
I
be
.
<EOS>
My
foot
be
very
cold

Mr.
Palliser
,
and
I
think
I
will
go
up
to
my
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
night
,
"
say
Jeffrey
,
offer
her
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
so
hard
that
you
should
have
incur
his
displeasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
not

no

even
that

good

Mr.

<EOS>
"
as
it
be
the
last

may
I

good

I
shall
be
away
to

morrow
before
you
be
up

"
  
<EOS>
He
still
hold
her
hand
;
but
it
have
not
be
in
his
for
half
a
minute
,
and
she
have
think
nothing
of
that
,
nor
do
she
draw
it
away
even
now
suddenly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
"
say
she
,
"
Glencora
be
very
wrong
there
,
 
do
an
injury

certainly
not

<EOS>
"
good

<EOS>
have
it
not

for
this
folly
of
Glencora

,
our
acquaintance
would
have
be
very
pleasant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
to
me
it
have
be
very
pleasant
.
<EOS>
good
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
she
leave
him
,
and
go
up
alone
to
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
whether
or
no
other
guest
be
still
leave
in
the
drawing
-
room
she
do
not
know
;
but
she
have
see
that
Mr.
Palliser
take
his
wife
up
-
stair
,
and
therefore
she
consider
herself
right
in
presume
that
the
party
be
break
up
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
 
Plantagenet
Palliser
,
accord
to
all
rule
of
courtesy
should
have
say
a
word
to
her
as
he
go
;
but
,
as
I
have
say
before
,
Alice
be
dispose
to
overlook
his
want
of
civility
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
so
she
go
up
alone
to
her
room
,
and
be
very
glad
to
find
herself
able
to
get
close
to
a
good
fire
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
in
truth
,
very
cold
 
cold
to
her
bone
,
in
spite
of
what
Lady
Glencora
have
say
on
behalf
of
the
moonlight
.
<EOS>
They
two
have
be
stand
all
but
still
during
the
great
part
of
the
time
that
they
have
be
talk
,
and
Alice
,
as
she
sit
herself
down
,
find
that
her
foot
be
numb
with
the
damp
that
have
penetrate
through
her
boot
.
<EOS>
certainly
Mr.
Palliser
have
reason
to
be
angry
that
his
wife
should
have
remain
out
in
the
night
air
so
long
,
 
though
perhaps
not
with
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
she
begin
to
think
of
what
have
be
tell
her
;
and
to
try
to
think
of
what
,
under
such
circumstance
,
it
behove
her
to
do
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
doubt
that
Lady
Glencora
have
intend
to
declare
that
,
if
opportunity
offer
itself
,
she
would
leave
her
husband
,
and
put
herself
under
the
protection
of
Mr.
Fitzgerald
;
and
Alice
,
moreover
,
have
become
painfully
conscious
that
the
poor
delude
unreasone
creature
have
teach
herself
to
think
that
she
may
excuse
herself
for
this
sin
to
her
own
conscience
by
the
fact
that
she
be
childless
,
and
that
she
may
thus
give
to
the
man
who
have
marry
her
an
opportunity
of
seek
another
wife
who
may
give
him
an
heir
.
<EOS>
Alice
well
know
how
insufficient
such
an
excuse
would
be
even
to
the
wretched
woman
who
have
frame
it
for
herself
.
<EOS>
but
still
it
would
operate
,
 
manifestly
have
already
operate
,
on
her
mind
,
teach
her
to
hope
that
good
may
come
out
of
evil
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
who
be
perfectly
clearsighte
as
regard
her
cousin
,
however
much
impair
her
vision
may
have
be
with
reference
to
herself
,
see
nothing
but
absolute
ruin
,
ruin
of
the
bad
and
most
intolerable
description
,
in
the
plan
which
Lady
Glencora
seem
to
have
form
.
<EOS>
to
her
it
be
black
in
the
depth
of
hell
;
and
she
know
that
to
Glencora
<EOS>
also
it
be
black
.
<EOS>
"
I
loathe
myself
,
"
Glencora
have
say
,
"
and
the
thing
that
I
be
think
of
.
"
  
<EOS>
what
be
Alice
to
do
under
these
circumstance
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
she
be
aware
,
have
quarrel
with
her
;
for
in
his
silent
way
he
have
first
show
that
he
have
trust
her
as
his
wife
's
friend
;
and
then
,
on
this
evening
,
he
have
show
that
he
have
cease
to
trust
her
.
<EOS>
but
she
care
little
for
this
.
<EOS>
if
she
tell
him
that
she
wish
to
speak
to
him
,
he
would
listen
,
let
his
opinion
of
her
be
what
it
may
;
and
have
listen
he
would
surely
act
in
some
way
that
would
serve
to
save
his
wife
.
<EOS>
what
Mr.
Palliser
may
think
of
herself
,
Alice
care
but
little
.
  
<EOS>
but
then
there
come
to
her
an
idea
that
be
in
every
respect
feminine
,
 
that
in
such
a
matter
she
have
no
right
to
betray
her
friend
.
<EOS>
when
one
woman
tell
the
story
of
her
love
to
another
woman
,
the
confidant
always
feel
that
she
will
be
a
traitor
if
she
reveal
the
secret
.
<EOS>
have
Lady
Glencora
make
Alice
believe
that
she
meditate
murder
,
or
robbery
,
Alice
would
have
have
no
difficulty
in
tell
the
tale
,
and
thus
prevent
the
crime
.
<EOS>
but
now
she
hesitate
,
feel
that
she
would
disgrace
herself
by
betray
her
friend
.
<EOS>
and
,
after
all
,
be
it
not
more
than
probable
that
Glencora
have
no
intention
of
carry
out
a
threat
the
very
thought
of
which
must
be
terrible
to
herself
?
  
<EOS>
as
she
be
think
of
all
this
,
sit
in
her
dressing
-
gown
close
over
the
fire
,
there
come
a
loud
knock
at
the
door
,
which
,
as
she
have
turn
the
key
,
she
be
force
to
answer
in
person
.
<EOS>
She
open
the
door
,
and
there
be
Iphigenia
Palliser
,
Jeffrey
's
cousin
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
's
cousin
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Vavasor
,
"
she
say
,
"
I
know
that
I
be
take
a
great
liberty
,
but
may
I
come
into
your
room
for
a
few
minute
?
<EOS>
I
so
much
wish
to
speak
to
you
!
"
<EOS>
alice
of
course
bade
her
enter
,
and
place
a
chair
for
her
by
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
Vavasor
have
make
very
little
intimacy
with
either
of
the
two
Miss
Pallisers
.
<EOS>
It
have
seem
to
herself
as
though
there
have
be
two
party
in
the
house
,
and
that
she
have
belong
to
the
one
which
be
head
by
the
wife
,
whereas
the
Miss
Pallisers
have
be
naturally
attach
to
that
of
the
husband
.
<EOS>
these
lady
,
as
she
have
already
see
,
almost
idolize
their
cousin
;
and
though
Plantagenet
Palliser
have
till
lately
treat
Alice
with
the
great
personal
courtesy
,
there
have
be
no
intimacy
of
friendship
between
them
,
and
consequently
none
between
her
and
his
special
adherent
.
<EOS>
nor
be
either
of
these
lady
prone
to
sudden
friendship
with
such
a
one
as
Alice
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
a
sudden
friendship
,
with
a
snuffy
president
of
a
foreign
learn
society
,
with
some
personally
unknown
lady
employ
on
female
emigration
,
be
very
much
in
their
way
.
<EOS>
but
Alice
have
not
show
herself
to
be
useful
or
learn
,
and
her
special
intimacy
with
Lady
Glencora
have
mark
her
out
as
in
some
sort
separate
from
them
and
their
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
I
be
intrude
,
"
say
Miss
Palliser
,
as
though
she
be
almost
afraid
of
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
,
no
,
"
say
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
can
do
anything
for
you
I
shall
be
very
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
go
to
-
morrow
,
and
if
I
do
not
speak
to
you
now
I
should
have
no
other
opportunity
.
<EOS>
Glencora
seem
to
be
very
much
attach
to
you
,
and
we
all
think
it
so
good
a
thing
that
she
should
have
such
a
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
have
not
all
change
your
mind
,
"
say
Alice
,
with
a
faint
smile
,
think
as
she
speak
that
the
"
all
"
must
have
be
specially
intend
to
include
the
master
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
no
;
 
by
no
mean
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
that
.
<EOS>
My
cousin
,
Mr.
Palliser
,
I
mean
,
like
you
so
much
when
you
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
he
do
not
like
me
quite
so
much
now
,
because
I
go
out
in
the
moonlight
with
his
wife
.
<EOS>
be
not
that
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
;
 
no
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
intend
to
mention
that
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
him
certainly
since
you
come
in
,
 
just
for
a
minute
,
and
he
be
vexed
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
about
that
that
I
would
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
plainly
enough
that
he
be
angry
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
think
you
would
have
bring
her
in
earlier
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
should
he
think
that
I
can
manage
his
wife
?
<EOS>
She
be
the
mistress
out
there
as
she
be
in
here
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
have
be
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
not
that
it
signify
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
he
have
be
unreasonable
;
I
do
not
,
indeed
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
He
have
certainly
be
vex
.
<EOS>
sometimes
he
have
much
to
vex
him
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
Glencora
be
very
young
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
also
have
declare
that
Lady
Glencora
be
very
young
.
<EOS>
It
be
probable
,
therefore
,
that
that
special
phrase
have
be
use
in
some
discussion
among
Mr.
Palliser
's
party
as
to
Glencora
's
foible
.
<EOS>
so
think
Alice
as
the
remembrance
of
the
word
come
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
not
young
than
when
Mr.
Palliser
marry
her
,
"
Alice
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
that
if
a
man
marry
a
young
wife
he
must
put
up
with
the
trouble
.
<EOS>
that
be
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
but
their
age
,
in
truth
,
be
very
suitable
.
<EOS>
My
cousin
himself
be
not
yet
thirty
.
<EOS>
when
I
say
that
Glencora
be
young
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
mean
that
she
be
young
in
spirit
,
and
perhaps
in
conduct
,
than
he
have
expect
to
find
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
be
not
to
suppose
that
he
complain
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
He
be
much
too
proud
for
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
hope
so
,
"
say
Alice
,
think
of
Mr.
Bott
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
how
to
explain
to
you
what
I
wish
to
say
,
or
how
far
I
may
be
justify
in
supposing
that
you
will
believe
me
to
be
act
solely
on
Glencora
's
behalf
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
have
some
influence
with
her
;
 
and
I
know
no
one
else
that
have
any

"
  
<EOS>

I
know
it

still
there
be
the
fact

I
not
right

in
suppose
what
?

<EOS>
"
in

that

before
her
marriage
with
my
cousin
?
"
  
Alice
pause
a
moment
before
she
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
have
,
"
she
then
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
think
you
be
agree
,
with
her
other
relation
,
that
such
a
marriage
would
have
be
very
dreadful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
speak
of
the
matter
in
the
presence
of
any
relative
of
Glencora
's
.
<EOS>
You
must
understand
,
Miss
Palliser
,
that
though
I
be
her
far
-
away
cousin
,
I
do
not
even
know
her
near
connection
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
Lady
Midlothian
till
she
come
here
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
advise
her
to
abandon
Mr.
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
never
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
she
be
much
with
you
,
just
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
use
to
see
her
,
certainly
.
"
  
<EOS>
then
there
be
a
pause
,
and
Miss
Palliser
,
in
truth
,
scarcely
know
how
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
hardness
about
Alice
which
her
visitor
have
not
expect
,
 
an
unwillingness
to
speak
or
even
to
listen
,
which
make
Miss
Palliser
almost
wish
that
she
be
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
however
,
mention
Burgo
Fitzgerald
's
name
,
and
out
of
the
room
now
she
could
not
go
without
explain
why
she
have
do
so
.
<EOS>
but
at
this
point
Alice
come
suddenly
to
her
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
"
just
then
she
be
often
with
me
,
"
say
Alice
,
continue
her
reply
;
"
and
there
be
much
talk
between
us
about
Mr.
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
what
be
my
advice
then
can
be
of
little
matter
;
but
in
this
we
shall
be
both
agree
,
Miss
Palliser
,
that
Glencora
now
should
certainly
not
be
call
upon
to
be
in
his
company
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
tell
you
,
then
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
 
she
have
tell
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
he
be
to
be
at
Lady
Monk
's
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
tell
me
that
Mr.
Palliser
expect
her
to
meet
him
at
the
place
to
which
they
be
go
when
they
leave
the
Duke
's
,
and
that
she
think
it
hard
that
she
should
be
subject
to
such
a
trial
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
should
be
no
trial
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
it
be
otherwise
?
<EOS>
come
,
Miss
Palliser
;
if
you
be
her
friend
,
be
fair
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
her
friend
;
 
but
I
be
,
above
everything
,
my
cousin
's
friend
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
me
that
she
have
complain
of
have
to
meet
this
man
.
<EOS>
He
declare
that
it
should
be
nothing
to
her
,
and
that
the
fear
be
an
idle
folly
.
<EOS>
It
should
be
nothing
to
her
,
but
still
the
fear
may
not
be
idle
.
<EOS>
be
there
any
reason
,
 
any
real
reason
,
 
why
she
should
not
go
?
<EOS>
Miss
Vavasor
,
I
conjure
you
to
tell
me
,
 
even
though
in
do
so
you
must
cast
so
deep
reproach
upon
her
name
!
<EOS>
anything
will
be
well
than
utter
disgrace
and
sin
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
conceive
that
I
cast
no
reproach
upon
her
in
say
that
there
be
great
reason
why
she
should
not
go
to
Monkshade
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
there
be
absolute
ground
for
interference
?
<EOS>
I
must
tell
him
,
you
know
,
openly
what
he
would
have
to
fear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
 
nay
,
Miss
Palliser
,
I
know
,
 
that
there
be
ample
reason
why
you
should
save
her
from
be
take
to
Monkshade
,
if
you
have
the
power
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
do
it
,
or
attempt
to
do
it
,
by
tell
him
just
what
you
tell
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
tell
him
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
think
of
that
,
I
suppose
,
before
you
come
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
yes
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
I
have
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
I
have
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
believe
all
through
that
you
would
assure
me
that
there
be
no
danger
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
you
would
have
say
that
she
be
innocent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
she
be
innocent
,
"
say
Alice
,
rise
from
her
chair
,
as
though
she
may
thus
give
emphasis
to
word
which
she
hardly
dare
to
speak
above
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
innocent
.
<EOS>
who
accuse
her
of
guilt
?
<EOS>
You
ask
me
a
question
on
his
behalf
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
on
her
 
and
on
his
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
question
which
I
feel
myself
bind
to
answer
truly
,
 
to
answer
with
reference
to
the
welfare
of
them
both
;
but
I
will
not
have
it
say
that
I
accuse
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
attach
to
Mr.
Fitzgerald
when
your
cousin
marry
her
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
this
have
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
She
tell
him
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
in
a
worldly
point
of
view
her
marriage
with
Mr.
Fitzgerald
would
probably
have
be
very
imprudent
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
be
utterly
ruinous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
so
;
I
say
nothing
about
that
.
<EOS>
but
as
it
turn
out
,
she
give
up
her
own
wish
and
marry
your
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
about
her
own
wish
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
what
she
do
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
marry
Mr.
Fitzgerald
,
have
she
not
be
hinder
by
the
advice
of
those
around
her
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
suppose
that
she
have
forget
him
in
so
short
a
time
.
<EOS>
there
can
be
no
guilt
in
her
remembrance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
guilt
in
love
any
other
than
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
Miss
Palliser
,
it
be
her
marriage
that
be
guilty
,
and
not
her
love
.
<EOS>
but
all
that
be
do
and
past
.
<EOS>
It
should
be
your
cousin
's
object
to
teach
her
to
forget
Mr.
Fitzgerald
,
and
he
will
not
do
that
by
take
her
to
a
house
where
that
gentleman
be
stay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
say
so
much
to
you
herself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
I
need
declare
to
you
what
she
have
say
herself

<EOS>
You
have
ask
me
a
question
,
and
I
have
answer
it
,
and
I
be
thankful
to
you
for
have
ask
it

<EOS>
what
object
can
either
of
us
have
but
to
assist
her
in
her
position
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
to
save
him
from
dishonour
.
<EOS>
I
have
so
hope
that
this
be
simply
a
childish
dread
on
her
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
so
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
childish
dread
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
the
power
to
prevent
her
go
to
Lady
Monk
's
,
I
implore
you
to
use
it
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
will
ask
you
to
promise
me
that
you
will
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
after
what
you
have
say
,
I
have
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
exactly
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
either
for
his
sake
or
for
her
,
there
be
none
.
"
  
<EOS>
Thereupon
Miss
Palliser
get
up
,
and
wish
her
companion
good
night
,
take
her
departure
.
<EOS>
throughout
the
interview
there
have
be
no
cordiality
of
feeling
between
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
pretence
of
friendship
,
even
as
they
be
part
.
<EOS>
They
acknowledge
that
their
object
be
different
.
<EOS>
that
of
Alice
be
to
save
Lady
Glencora
from
ruin
.
<EOS>
that
of
Miss
Palliser
be
to
save
her
cousin
from
disgrace
,
 
with
perhaps
some
further
honest
desire
to
prevent
sorrow
and
sin
.
<EOS>
one
love
Lady
Glencora
,
and
the
other
clearly
do
not
love
her
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
Alice
feel
that
Miss
Palliser
,
in
come
to
her
,
have
act
well
,
and
that
to
herself
this
come
have
afford
immense
relief
.
<EOS>
some
step
would
now
be
take
to
prevent
that
meeting
which
she
have
so
deprecate
,
and
it
would
be
take
without
any
great
violation
of
confidence
on
her
part
.
<EOS>
She
have
say
nothing
as
to
which
Lady
Glencora
could
feel
herself
aggrieved
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
next
morning
she
be
down
in
the
breakfast
-
room
soon
after
nine
,
and
have
not
be
in
the
room
many
minute
before
Mr.
Palliser
enter
.
<EOS>
"
the
carriage
be
order
for
you
at
a
quarter
before
ten
,
"
he
say
,
"
and
I
have
come
down
to
give
you
your
breakfast
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
smile
on
his
face
as
he
speak
,
and
Alice
could
see
that
he
intend
to
make
himself
pleasant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
allow
me
to
give
you
yours
instead
?
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
but
as
it
happen
,
no
giving
on
either
side
be
need
,
as
Alice
's
breakfast
be
bring
to
her
separately
.
  
<EOS>
"
Glencora
bid
me
say
that
she
will
be
down
immediately
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
then
make
some
inquiry
with
reference
to
the
effect
of
last
night
's
imprudence
,
which
receive
only
a
half
-
pronounce
reply
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
be
willing
to
be
gracious
,
but
do
not
intend
to
be
understand
as
have
forgive
the
offence
.
<EOS>
the
Miss
Pallisers
then
come
in
together
,
and
after
them
Mr.
Bott
,
closely
follow
by
Mrs.
Marsham
,
and
all
of
them
make
inquiry
after
Lady
Glencora
,
as
though
it
be
to
be
suppose
that
she
may
probably
be
in
a
perilous
state
after
what
she
have
undergo
on
the
previous
evening
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
be
particularly
anxious
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
frost
be
so
uncommonly
severe
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
any
delicate
person
like
Lady
Glencora
must
have
suffer
in
remain
out
so
long
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
insinuation
that
Alice
be
not
a
delicate
person
and
that
,
as
regard
her
,
the
severity
of
the
frost
be
of
no
moment
,
be
very
open
,
and
be
duly
appreciate
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
be
aware
that
his
great
patron
have
in
some
sort
change
his
opinion
about
Miss
Vavasor
,
and
he
be
of
course
disposed
to
change
his
own
.
<EOS>
a
fortnight
since
Alice
may
have
be
as
delicate
as
she
please
in
Mr.
Bott
's
estimation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
do
not
consider
Lady
Glencora
delicate
,
"
say
Alice
to
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
not
robust
,
"
say
the
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
by
no
means
,
"
say
Mrs.
Marsham
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
no

say
Mr.
Bott

<EOS>
Alice
know
that
she
be
be
accuse
of
be
robust
herself
;
but
she
bear
it
in
silence
.
<EOS>
ploughboy
and
milkmaid
be
robust
,
and
the
accusation
be
a
heavy
one
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
however
,
think
that
she
would
not
have
mind
it
,
if
she
could
have
allow
herself
to
reply
;
but
this
at
the
moment
of
her
go
away
she
could
not
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
be
as
strong
as
the
rest
of
us
,
"
say
Iphigenia
Palliser
,
who
feel
that
after
last
night
she
owe
something
to
Miss
Vavasor

<EOS>
"
as
some
of
us
,

Mr.
Bott
,
determine
to
persevere
in
his
accusation
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
moment
Lady
Glencora
enter
,
and
encounter
the
eager
inquiry
of
her
two
duenna
.
<EOS>
these
,
however
,
she
quickly
put
aside
,
and
make
her
way
up
to
Alice

<EOS>
"
the
last
morning
have
come
,
then

"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes

he
say
it
coldly
;

Alice
begin
to
wish
that
she

never

<EOS>
"

be
so
place

she
could
see
Alice

She
make
a
slight
sign
with
her
head

as
much
as

nothing

<EOS>
on
the
night
before
Christmas
Eve
two
man
be
sit
together
in
George
Vavasor
's
room
in
Cecil
Street
.
<EOS>
It
be
past
twelve
o'clock
,
and
they
be
both
smoking
;
there
be
square
bottle
on
the
table
contain
spirit
,
with
hot
water
and
cold
water
in
jug
,
and
one
of
the
two
man
be
use
,
and
have
be
use
,
these
material
for
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
have
not
be
drink
,
nor
do
it
appear
as
though
he
intend
to
begin
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
weak
brandy
and
water
in
a
glass
by
his
side
,
but
there
it
have
remain
untouched
for
the
last
twenty
minute
.
<EOS>
His
companion
,
however
,
have
twice
in
that
time
replenish
his
beaker
,
and
be
now
puff
out
the
smoke
of
his
pipe
with
the
fury
of
a
steamer
's
funnel
when
she
have
not
yet
burn
the
black
off
her
last
instalment
of
fresh
coal
.
<EOS>
this
man
be
Burgo
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
He
be
as
handsome
as
ever
;
 
a
man
whom
neither
man
nor
woman
could
help
regard
as
a
thing
beautiful
to
behold
;
 
but
not
the
less
be
there
in
his
eye
and
cheek
a
look
of
haggard
dissipation
,
 
of
riotous
living
,
which
have
become
wearisome
,
by
its
continuance
,
even
to
himself
,
 
that
tell
to
all
who
see
him
much
of
the
history
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
Most
man
who
drink
at
night
,
and
be
out
till
cockcrow
do
deed
of
darkness
,
become
red
in
their
face
,
have
pimple
cheek
and
watery
eye
,
and
be
bloated
and
not
comfortable
to
be
see
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
kind
dispensation
of
Providence
who
thus
afford
to
such
sinner
a
visible
sign
,
to
be
see
day
by
day
,
of
the
injury
which
be
be
do
.
<EOS>
the
first
approach
of
a
carbuncle
on
the
nose
,
about
the
age
of
thirty
,
have
stop
many
a
man
from
drink
.
<EOS>
no
one
like
to
have
carbuncle
on
his
nose
,
or
to
appear
before
his
female
friend
with
eye
which
look
as
though
they
be
swim
in
grog
.
<EOS>
but
to
Burgo
Fitzgerald
Providence
in
her
anger
have
not
afford
this
protection
.
<EOS>
He
become
at
time
pale
,
sallow
,
worn
,
and
haggard
.
<EOS>
He
grow
thin
,
and
still
thin
.
<EOS>
at
time
he
have
be
ill
to
death
's
door
.
<EOS>
among
his
intimate
friend
there
be
those
who
hear
him
declare
frequently
that
his
liver
have
become
useless
to
him
;
and
that
,
as
for
gastric
juice
,
he
have
none
leave
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
still
his
beauty
remain
.
<EOS>
the
perfect
form
of
his
almost
god
-
like
face
be
the
same
as
ever
,
and
the
brightness
of
his
bright
blue
eye
be
never
quench
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
present
occasion
he
have
come
to
Vavasor
's
room
with
the
object
of
ask
from
him
certain
assistance
,
and
perhaps
also
some
amount
of
advice
.
<EOS>
but
as
regard
the
latter
article
he
be
,
I
think
,
in
the
state
of
most
man
when
they
seek
for
counsellor
who
shall
counsel
them
to
do
evil
.
<EOS>
advice
administer
in
accordance
with
his
own
view
would
give
him
comfortable
encouragement
,
but
advice
on
the
other
side
he
be
prepared
to
disregard
altogether
.
<EOS>
these
two
man
have
know
each
other
long
,
and
a
close
intimacy
have
exist
between
them
in
the
day
past
,
previous
to
Lady
Glencora
's
engagement
with
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
when
Lady
Glencora
endeavour
,
vainly
as
we
know
,
to
obtain
aid
from
Alice
Vavasor
,
Burgo
have
be
instigate
to
believe
that
Alice
's
cousin
may
assist
him
.
<EOS>
any
such
assistance
George
Vavasor
would
have
be
quite
ready
to
give
.
<EOS>
some
pecuniary
assistance
he
have
give
,
he
at
that
time
have
be
in
good
fund
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
have
for
a
moment
induce
Burgo
to
think
that
he
could
obtain
for
the
pair
the
use
of
the
house
in
Queen
Anne
Street
as
a
point
at
which
they
may
meet
,
and
from
whence
they
may
start
on
their
journey
of
love
.
<EOS>
all
that
be
over
.
<EOS>
those
hope
have
be
frustrate
,
and
Lady
Glencora
M'Cluskie
have
become
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
and
not
Lady
Glencora
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
but
now
other
hope
have
spring
up
,
and
Burgo
be
again
look
to
his
friend
for
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
she
would
,
"
Burgo
say
,
as
he
lift
the
glass
to
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
thing
of
that
sort
that
a
man
can
only
believe
,
 
perhaps
only
hope
,
 
till
he
have
try
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
she
be
not
happy
with
him
,
and
I
have
make
up
my
mind
that
I
will
at
least
ask
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
he
would
have
her
fortune
all
the
same
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
how
that
would
be
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
inquire
,
and
I
do
not
mean
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
do
not
expect
you
or
any
one
else
to
believe
me
,
but
her
money
have
no
bearing
on
the
question
now
.
<EOS>
Heaven
know
I
want
money
bad
enough
,
but
I
would
not
take
away
another
man
's
wife
for
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
mean
to
say
you
think
it
would
be
wicked
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
to
be
above
those
prejudice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
very
well
for
you
to
chaff
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
no
chaff
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
fairly
I
would
not
run
away
with
any
man
's
wife
.
<EOS>
I
have
an
old
-
fashioned
idea
that
when
a
man
have
get
a
wife
he
ought
to
be
allow
to
keep
her
.
<EOS>
public
opinion
,
I
know
,
be
against
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
run
away
with
my
wife
,
"
say
Burgo
,
with
emphasis
;
"
that
be
the
way
I
look
at
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
engage
to
me
first
;
and
she
really
love
me
,
while
she
never
care
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nevertheless
,
marriage
be
marriage
,
and
the
law
be
against
you
.
<EOS>
but
if
I
do
go
in
for
such
a
troublesome
job
at
all
,
I
certainly
should
keep
an
eye
upon
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
can
make
no
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
do
make
a
difference
,
I
suppose
,
when
you
first
think
of
marry
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
it
do
.
<EOS>
My
people
bring
us
together
because
she
have
a
large
fortune
and
I
have
none
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
in
the
world
about
that
.
<EOS>
and
I
will
tell
you
what
<EOS>
;
I
believe
that
old
harridan
of
an
aunt
of
mine
be
willing
to
do
the
same
thing
now
again
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
do
not
say
as
much
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
dare
do
that
,
but
I
do
believe
she
mean
it
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
where
she
expect
to
go
to
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
grateful
on
your
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
soul
I
hate
her
.
<EOS>
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
love
for
me
now
so
much
as
downright
malice
against
Palliser
,
because
he
baulk
her
project
before
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
wicked
old
woman
.
<EOS>
some
of
us
fellow
be
wicked
enough
 
you
and
I
for
instance
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
thank
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
,
however
,
that
I
be
qualified
to
run
in
a
curricle
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
we
be
angel
to
such
an
old
she
-
devil
as
that
.
<EOS>
You
may
believe
me
or
not
,
as
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
will
not
believe
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
say
I
do
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
truth
be
,
I
want
to
get
her
,
partly
because
I
love
her
;
but
chiefly
because
I
do
believe
in
my
heart
that
she
love
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
for
her
sake
then
!
<EOS>
You
be
ready
to
sacrifice
yourself
to
do
her
a
good
turn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
for
sacrifice
myself
,
that
be
do
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
man
utterly
ruin
and
would
cut
my
throat
to
-
morrow
for
the
sake
of
my
relation
,
if
I
care
enough
about
them
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
own
condition
pretty
well
.
<EOS>
I
have
make
a
shipwreck
of
everything
,
and
have
now
only
get
to
go
down
among
the
breaker
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
only
you
would
like
to
take
Lady
Glencora
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
by
heaven
!
<EOS>
but
sometimes
,
when
I
do
think
about
it
at
all
,
 
which
I
do
as
seldom
as
I
can
,
 
it
seem
to
me
that
I
may
still
become
a
different
fellow
if
it
be
possible
for
me
to
marry
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
marry
her
when
she
be
free
to
marry
any
one
and
when
her
money
be
her
own
,
it
may
have
be
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
would
be
quite
as
much
so
now
.
<EOS>
I
do
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
if
I
could
get
her
once
,
say
to
Italy
,
or
perhaps
to
Greece
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
could
treat
her
well
,
and
live
with
her
quietly
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
would
try
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
without
the
assistance
of
brandy

cigar

"

yes

and
without
any
money

"
  
"
with
only
a
little
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
laugh
at
me
;
but
I
make
picture
to
myself
of
a
sort
of
life
which
I
think
would
suit
us
,
and
be
very
different
from
this
hideous
way
of
living
,
with
which
I
have
become
so
sick
that
I
loathe
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

something
like
Juan

Pall

after
you

the

He
would
get
a
divorce

of
course
,

then
we
should

I
really
do
not
think
he
would
dislike
it

when
it
be
all
do

They
tell

he
do
not

You

do
more

once

for
about
two
minute

I
do
speak
to
her

what
do

She
say

fond

could
have
fall
at

foot

moment

do

Vavasor
pause
a
few
minute
.
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
she
be
fond
of
you

he
then
say
;
"
but
whether
she
have
pluck
for
such
a
thing
as
this
,
be
more
than
I
can
say
.
<EOS>
probably
she
have
not

if
she
have

probably
you
would
fail

carry
out
your
plan

<EOS>
"
I
must
get
a
little
money
first
,
"
say
Burgo

"
<EOS>
and
that
be
an
operation
which
no
doubt
you
find
more
difficult
every
day

as
you
grow
old
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seem
to
be
much
the

sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
I
go
to
Magruin
this
morning
.

He

fellow

live
out
near
Gray

"
just
beyond
the
Foundling
Hospital

<EOS>
I
go
to
him
,
and
he
be
quite
civil
about
it

<EOS>
He
say
I
owe
him
over
three
thousand
pound
,
but
that
do
not
seem
to
make
any
difference

"
  
<EOS>
"
how
much
do
you
ever
have
from
him
?
"
  
<EOS>

I
do
not
recollect
that
I
ever
absolutely
have
any

He
get
a

a
tailor

go
to
smash

he
keep
on
renew
that

it
grow
to

ever
so
many

I
think
he
do
once

me
have
twenty
-
four
pound
,

certainly
never
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
he
say
he
will
give
you
money
now
?

I
suppose
you
tell
him
why
you
want
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
name
her
,

I
tell
him
what
would

him
understand

I
hope
to
get
off
with
a
lady

have
a
lot
of
tin

ask
him
for

fifty

five
hundred

this
I
shall
go
off
the
hook
altogether
soon
;
and
if
I
be
dead
my
people
would
pay
my
debt
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
before
the
evening
be
over
Vavasor
promise
the
assistance
ask
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
be
lend
his
name
to
a
man
who
be
utterly
ruin
,
and
put
it
into
the
hand
of
another
man
who
be
absolutely
without
conscience
in
the
use
he
would
make
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
be
create
for
himself
trouble
,
and
in
all
probability
loss
,
which
he
be
ill
able
to
bear
.
<EOS>
but
the
thing
be
one
which
come
within
the
pale
of
his
law
.
<EOS>
such
assistance
as
that
he
may
ask
of
other
,
and
have
ask
and
receive
before
now
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
reckless
deed
on
his
part
,
but
then
all
his
doing
be
reckless
.
<EOS>
It
be
consonant
with
his
mode
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
would
,
old
fellow
,
"
say
Burgo
,
as
he
get
up
to
go
away
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
you
know
,
I
shall
pull
through
in
this
;
and
perhaps
,
after
all
,
some
part
of
her
fortune
will
come
with
her
.
<EOS>
if
so
you
will
be
all
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
may
.
<EOS>
but
look
here
,
Burgo
,
 
do
not
you
give
that
fellow
up
the
bill
till
you
have
get
the
money
into
your
fist
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
quite
easy
about
that
.
<EOS>
I
know
their
trick
.
<EOS>
He
and
I
will
go
to
the
bank
together
,
and
we
shall
squabble
there
at
the
door
about
four
or
five
<EOS>
odd
sovereign
<EOS>
,
 
and
at
last
I
shall
have
to
give
him
up
two
or
three
.
<EOS>
beastly
old
robber
!
<EOS>
I
declare
I
think
he
be
bad
than
I
be
myself
.
"
<EOS>
then
Burgo
Fitzgerald
take
a
little
more
brandy
and
water
and
go
away
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
live
at
this
time
in
the
house
of
one
of
his
relative
in
Cavendish
Square
,
north
of
Oxford
Street
.
<EOS>
His
uncle
and
his
aunt
,
and
all
those
who
be
his
natural
friend
,
have
cling
to
him
with
a
tenacity
that
be
surprising
;
for
he
have
never
be
true
to
any
of
them
,
and
do
not
even
pretend
to
like
them
.
<EOS>
His
father
,
with
whom
for
many
year
he
have
not
be
on
speak
term
,
be
now
dead
;
but
he
have
sister
whose
husband
would
still
open
their
house
to
him
,
either
in
London
or
in
the
country
;
 
would
open
their
house
to
him
,
and
lend
him
their
horse
,
and
provide
him
with
every
luxury
which
the
rich
enjoy
,
 
except
ready
money
.
<EOS>
when
the
uttermost
stress
of
pecuniary
embarrassment
would
come
upon
him
,
they
would
pay
something
to
stave
off
the
immediate
evil
.
<EOS>
and
so
Burgo
go
on
.
<EOS>
nobody
now
think
of
say
much
to
reproach
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
know
to
be
waste
of
word
,
and
trouble
in
vain
.
<EOS>
They
be
still
fond
of
him
because
he
be
beautiful
and
never
vain
of
his
beauty
;
 
because
in
the
midst
of
his
recklessness
there
be
always
about
him
a
certain
kindliness
which
make
him
pleasant
to
those
around
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
soft
and
gracious
with
child
,
and
would
be
very
courteous
to
his
lady
cousin
.
<EOS>
They
know
that
as
a
man
he
be
worthless
,
but
nevertheless
they
love
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
the
secret
of
it
be
chiefly
in
this
,
 
that
he
seem
to
think
so
little
of
himself
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
as
he
walk
home
in
the
middle
of
the
night
from
Cecil
Street
to
Cavendish
Square
he
do
think
much
of
himself
.
<EOS>
indeed
such
self
-
thought
come
naturally
to
all
man
,
be
their
outward
conduct
ever
so
reckless
.
<EOS>
every
man
to
himself
be
the
centre
of
the
whole
world
;
 
the
axle
on
which
it
all
turn
.
<EOS>
all
knowledge
be
but
his
own
perception
of
the
thing
around
him
.
<EOS>
all
love
,
and
care
for
other
,
and
solicitude
for
the
world
's
welfare
,
be
but
his
own
feeling
as
to
the
world
's
want
and
the
world
's
merit
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
play
his
part
as
a
centre
of
all
thing
very
badly
.
<EOS>
of
that
he
be
very
well
aware
.
<EOS>
He
have
sense
enough
to
know
that
it
should
be
a
man
's
lot
to
earn
his
bread
after
some
fashion
,
and
he
often
tell
himself
that
never
as
yet
have
he
earn
so
much
as
a
penny
roll
.
<EOS>
He
have
learn
to
comprehend
that
the
world
's
progress
depend
on
the
way
in
which
man
do
their
duty
by
each
other
,
 
that
the
progress
of
one
generation
depend
on
the
discharge
of
such
duty
by
that
which
precede
it
;
 
and
he
know
that
he
,
in
his
generation
,
have
do
nothing
to
promote
such
progress
.
<EOS>
He
thoroughly
despise
himself
,
 
if
there
may
be
any
good
in
that
!
<EOS>
but
on
such
occasion
as
these
,
when
the
wine
he
have
drunk
be
sufficient
only
to
drive
away
from
him
the
numbness
of
despair
,
when
he
be
all
alone
with
the
cold
night
air
upon
his
face
,
when
the
star
be
bright
above
him
and
the
world
around
him
be
almost
quiet
,
he
would
still
ask
himself
whether
there
may
not
yet
be
,
even
for
him
,
some
hope
of
a
redemption
,
 
some
chance
of
a
well
life
in
store
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
still
young
,
 
want
some
year
of
thirty
.
<EOS>
Could
there
be
,
even
for
him
,
some
mode
of
extrication
from
his
misery
?
  
<EOS>
We
know
what
be
the
mode
which
now
,
at
this
moment
,
be
suggest
itself
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
propose
to
himself
,
as
the
good
thing
that
he
could
do
,
to
take
away
another
man
's
wife
and
make
himself
happy
with
her
!
<EOS>
what
he
have
say
to
Vavasor
as
to
disregard
Lady
Glencora
's
money
have
be
perfectly
true
.
<EOS>
that
in
the
event
of
her
go
off
with
him
,
some
portion
of
her
enormous
wealth
would
still
cling
to
her
,
he
do
believe
.
<EOS>
see
that
she
have
no
child
he
could
not
understand
where
else
it
should
all
go
.
<EOS>
but
he
think
of
this
as
it
regard
her
,
not
as
it
regard
him
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
before
make
his
suit
to
her
,
 
<EOS>
a
suit
which
be
then
honourable
,
however
disadvantageous
it
may
have
seem
to
be
to
her
 
he
have
make
in
his
mind
certain
calculation
as
to
the
good
thing
which
would
result
to
him
if
he
be
successful
He
would
keep
hound
,
and
have
three
or
four
horse
every
day
for
his
own
riding
,
and
he
would
have
no
more
interview
with
Magruin
,
wait
in
that
rogue
's
dingy
back
parlour
for
many
a
weary
wretched
half
-
hour
,
till
the
rogue
should
be
pleased
to
show
himself
.
<EOS>
so
far
he
have
be
mercenary
;
but
he
have
learn
to
love
the
girl
,
and
to
care
more
for
her
than
for
her
money
,
and
when
the
day
of
disappointment
come
upon
him
,
 
the
day
on
which
she
have
tell
him
that
all
between
them
be
to
be
over
for
ever
,
 
he
have
,
for
a
few
hour
,
feel
the
loss
of
his
love
more
than
the
loss
of
his
money
.
  
<EOS>
then
he
have
have
no
further
hope
.
<EOS>
no
such
idea
as
that
which
now
fill
his
mind
have
then
come
upon
him
.
<EOS>
the
girl
have
go
from
him
and
marry
another
man
,
and
there
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
by
degree
tiding
have
reach
him
that
she
be
not
happy
,
 
reach
him
through
the
mouth
of
people
who
be
glad
to
exaggerate
all
that
they
have
hear
.
<EOS>
a
whole
tribe
of
his
female
relative
have
be
anxious
to
promote
his
marriage
with
Lady
Glencora
M'Cluskie
,
declare
that
,
after
all
that
be
come
and
go
,
Burgo
would
come
forth
from
his
trouble
as
a
man
of
great
wealth
.
<EOS>
so
great
be
the
wealth
of
the
heiress
that
it
may
withstand
even
his
propensity
for
spending
.
<EOS>
that
whole
tribe
have
be
bitterly
disappoint
;
and
when
they
hear
that
Mr.
Palliser
's
marriage
have
give
him
no
child
,
and
that
Lady
Glencora
be
unhappy
,
 
they
make
their
remark
in
triumph
rather
than
in
sorrow
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
they
look
forward
approvingly
to
such
a
step
as
that
which
Burgo
now
wish
to
take
,
 
though
as
regard
his
aunt
,
Lady
Monk
,
he
himself
have
accuse
her
;
but
they
whisper
that
such
thing
have
be
do
and
must
be
expect
,
when
marriage
be
make
up
as
have
be
that
marriage
between
Mr.
Palliser
and
his
bride
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
walk
on
,
think
of
his
project
,
he
strive
hard
to
cheat
himself
into
a
belief
that
he
would
do
a
good
thing
in
carry
Lady
Glencora
away
from
her
husband
.
<EOS>
bad
as
have
be
his
life
he
have
never
before
do
aught
so
bad
as
that
.
<EOS>
the
more
fix
his
intention
become
,
the
more
thoroughly
he
come
to
perceive
how
great
and
grievous
be
the
crime
which
he
contemplate
.
<EOS>
to
elope
with
another
man
's
wife
no
longer
appear
to
him
to
be
a
joke
at
which
such
man
as
he
may
smile
.
<EOS>
but
he
try
to
think
that
in
this
case
there
would
be
special
circumstance
which
would
almost
justify
him
,
and
also
her
.
<EOS>
They
have
love
each
other
and
have
swear
to
love
each
other
with
constancy
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
no
change
in
the
feeling
or
even
in
the
wish
of
either
of
them
.
<EOS>
but
cold
people
have
come
between
them
with
cold
calculation
,
and
have
separate
them
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
,
he
tell
himself
,
make
to
marry
a
man
she
do
not
love
.
<EOS>
if
they
two
love
each
other
truly
,
would
it
not
still
be
well
that
they
should
come
together
?
<EOS>
Would
not
the
sin
be
forgive
on
account
of
the
injustice
which
have
be
do
to
them
?
<EOS>
have
Mr.
Palliser
a
right
to
expect
more
from
a
wife
who
have
be
make
to
marry
him
without
love
him
?
<EOS>
then
he
revert
to
those
dream
of
a
life
of
love
,
in
some
sunny
country
,
of
which
he
have
speak
to
Vavasor
,
and
he
strove
to
nourish
them
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
have
laugh
at
him
,
talk
of
Juan
and
Haidée
.
<EOS>
but
Vavasor
,
he
say
to
himself
,
be
a
hard
cold
man
,
who
have
no
touch
of
romance
in
his
character
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
be
laugh
out
of
his
plan
by
such
as
he
,
 
nor
would
he
be
frighten
by
the
threat
of
any
Lambro
who
may
come
after
him
,
whether
he
may
come
in
the
guise
of
indignant
uncle
or
injure
husband
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
cross
from
Regent
Street
through
Hanover
Square
,
and
as
he
come
out
by
the
iron
gate
into
Oxford
Street
,
a
poor
wretched
girl
,
lightly
clothe
in
thin
raiment
,
into
whose
bone
the
sharp
freezing
air
be
penetrate
,
ask
him
for
money
.
<EOS>
Would
he
give
her
something
to
get
drink
,
so
that
for
a
moment
she
may
feel
the
warmth
of
her
life
renew
?
<EOS>
such
midnight
petition
be
common
enough
in
his
ear
,
and
he
be
pass
on
without
thinking
of
her
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
urgent
,
and
take
hold
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
for
love
of
God
,
"
she
say
,
"
if
it
be
only
a
penny
to
get
a
glass
of
gin
!
<EOS>
feel
my
hand
,
 
how
cold
it
be
.
"
<EOS>
and
she
strove
to
put
it
up
against
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
He
look
round
at
her
and
see
that
she
be
very
young
,
 
sixteen
,
perhaps
,
at
the
most
,
and
that
she
have
once
,
 
nay
very
lately
,
 
be
exquisitely
pretty
.
<EOS>
there
still
linger
about
her
eye
some
remain
of
that
look
of
perfect
innocency
and
pure
faith
which
have
be
her
not
more
than
twelve
month
since
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
at
midnight
,
in
the
middle
of
the
street
,
she
be
pray
for
a
pennyworth
of
gin
,
as
the
only
comfort
she
know
,
or
could
expect
!
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
cold
!
"
<EOS>
say
he
,
try
to
speak
to
her
cheerily
.
  
<EOS>
"
cold
!
"
say
she
,
repeat
the
word
,
and
strive
to
wrap
herself
closer
in
her
rag
,
as
she
shiver
 
"
oh
God
!
<EOS>
if
you
know
what
it
be
to
be
as
cold
as
I
be
!
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
in
the
world
,
 
not
one
penny
,
 
not
a
hole
to
lie
in
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
alike
then
,
"
say
Burgo
,
with
a
slight
low
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
I
also
have
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
be
poor
than
I
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
poor
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
say
.
<EOS>
and
then
she
look
up
into
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
gracious
;
how
beautiful
you
be
!
<EOS>
such
as
you
be
never
poor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
laugh
again
,
 
in
a
different
tone
.
<EOS>
He
always
laugh
when
any
one
tell
him
of
his
beauty
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
a
deal
poor
than
you
,
my
girl
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
have
thirty
thousand
pound
bad
than
nothing
.
<EOS>
but
come
along
,
and
I
will
get
you
something
to
eat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
?
"
say
she
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
then
look
up
at
him
again
,
she
exclaim
 
"
oh
,
you
be
so
handsome
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
her
to
a
public
-
house
and
give
her
bread
and
meat
and
beer
,
and
stand
by
her
while
she
eat
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
shy
with
him
then
,
and
would
fain
have
take
it
to
a
corner
by
herself
,
have
he
allow
her
.
<EOS>
He
perceive
this
,
and
turn
his
back
to
her
,
but
still
speak
to
her
a
word
or
two
as
she
eat
.
<EOS>
the
woman
at
the
bar
who
serve
him
look
at
him
wonderingly
,
stare
into
his
face
;
and
the
pot
-
boy
wake
himself
thoroughly
that
he
may
look
at
Burgo
;
and
the
waterman
from
the
cab
-
stand
stare
at
him
;
and
woman
who
come
in
for
gin
look
almost
lovingly
up
into
his
eye
.
<EOS>
He
regard
them
all
not
at
all
,
show
no
feeling
of
disgrace
at
his
position
,
and
no
desire
to
carry
himself
as
a
ruffler
.
<EOS>
He
quietly
pay
what
be
due
when
the
girl
have
finish
her
meal
,
and
then
walk
with
her
out
of
the
shop
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
,
"
say
he
,
"
what
must
I
do
with
you
?
<EOS>
if
I
give
you
a
shilling
can
you
get
a
bed
?
"
<EOS>
She
tell
him
that
she
could
get
a
bed
for
sixpence
.
"
<EOS>
then
keep
the
other
sixpence
for
your
breakfast
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
but
you
must
promise
me
that
you
will
buy
no
gin
to
-
night
.
"
<EOS>
She
promise
him
,
and
then
he
give
her
his
hand
as
he
wish
her
good
night
;
 
his
hand
,
which
it
have
be
the
dear
wish
of
Lady
Glencora
to
call
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
take
it
and
press
it
to
her
lip
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
may
once
see
you
again
,
"
she
say
,
"
because
you
be
so
good
and
so
beautiful
.
"
<EOS>
He
laugh
again
cheerily
,
and
walk
on
,
cross
the
street
towards
Cavendish
Square
.
<EOS>
She
stand
look
at
him
till
he
be
out
of
sight
,
and
then
as
she
move
away
,
 
let
us
hope
to
the
bed
which
his
bounty
have
provide
,
and
not
to
a
gin
-
shop
,
 
she
exclaim
to
herself
again
and
again
 
<EOS>
"
Gracious
,
how
beautiful
he
be
!
"
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
good
un
,
"
the
woman
at
the
public
-
house
have
say
as
soon
as
he
leave
it
;
"
but
,
my
!
<EOS>
do
you
ever
see
a
man
's
face
handsome
as
that
fellow
's
?
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Burgo
!
<EOS>
all
who
have
see
him
since
life
have
begin
with
him
have
love
him
and
strive
to
cherish
him
.
<EOS>
and
with
it
all
,
to
what
a
state
have
he
come
!
<EOS>
Poor
Burgo
!
<EOS>
have
his
eye
be
less
brightly
blue
,
and
his
face
less
godlike
in
form
,
it
may
be
that
thing
would
have
go
better
with
him
.
<EOS>
a
sweeter
-
temper
man
than
he
never
live
,
 
nor
one
who
be
of
a
kind
nature
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
he
have
barely
money
about
him
to
take
him
down
to
his
aunt
's
house
at
Monkshade
,
and
as
he
have
promise
to
be
there
before
Christmas
Day
,
he
be
bind
to
start
on
the
next
morning
,
before
help
from
Mr.
Magruin
be
possible
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
out
of
his
very
narrow
fund
he
have
give
half
a
crown
to
comfort
the
poor
creature
who
have
speak
to
him
in
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
contain
a
Love
letter
.
 
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
as
he
sit
alone
in
his
room
,
after
Fitzgerald
have
leave
him
,
begin
to
think
of
the
day
in
which
he
have
before
wish
to
assist
his
friend
in
his
view
with
reference
to
Lady
Glencora
;
 
or
rather
he
begin
to
think
of
Alice
's
behaviour
then
,
and
of
Alice
's
word
.
<EOS>
Alice
have
steadfastly
refuse
to
give
any
aid
.
<EOS>
no
less
likely
assistant
for
such
a
purpose
could
have
be
select
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
be
very
earnest
in
declare
that
it
be
Glencora
's
duty
to
stand
by
her
promise
to
Burgo
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
a
desperate
spendthrift
,
"
Kate
Vavasor
have
say
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
then
let
her
teach
him
to
be
otherwise
,
"
Alice
have
answer
.
<EOS>
"
that
may
have
be
a
good
reason
for
refuse
his
offer
when
he
first
make
it
;
but
it
can
be
no
excuse
for
untruth
,
now
that
she
have
tell
him
that
she
love
him
!
"
<EOS>
"
if
a
woman
,
"
she
have
say
again
,
"
will
not
venture
her
fortune
for
the
man
she
love
,
her
love
be
not
worth
have
.
<EOS>
"
all
this
George
Vavasor
remember
now
;
and
as
he
remember
it
he
ask
himself
whether
the
woman
that
have
once
love
him
would
venture
her
fortune
for
him
still
.
  
<EOS>
though
his
sister
have
press
him
on
the
subject
with
all
the
vehemence
that
she
could
use
,
he
have
hardly
hitherto
make
up
his
mind
that
he
really
desire
to
marry
Alice
.
<EOS>
there
have
grow
upon
him
lately
certain
bohemian
propensity
,
 
a
love
of
absolute
independence
in
his
thought
as
well
as
action
,
 
which
be
antagonistic
to
marriage
.
<EOS>
He
be
almost
inclined
to
think
that
marriage
be
an
old
-
fashioned
custom
,
fit
indeed
well
enough
for
the
usual
dull
life
of
the
world
at
large
,
 
as
many
man
both
in
heathen
and
in
christian
age
have
teach
themselves
to
think
of
religion
,
 
but
which
be
not
adapt
to
his
advanced
intelligence
.
<EOS>
if
he
love
any
woman
he
love
his
cousin
Alice
.
<EOS>
if
he
thoroughly
respect
any
woman
he
respect
her
.
<EOS>
but
that
idea
of
tie
himself
down
to
a
household
be
in
itself
distasteful
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
thing
terrible
to
think
of
,
"
he
once
say
to
a
congenial
friend
in
these
day
of
his
life
,
"
that
a
man
should
give
permission
to
a
priest
to
tie
him
to
another
human
being
like
a
siamese
twin
,
so
that
all
power
of
separate
and
solitary
action
should
be
take
from
him
for
ever
!
<EOS>
the
beast
of
the
field
do
not
treat
each
other
so
badly
.
<EOS>
They
neither
drink
themselves
drunk
,
nor
eat
themselves
stupid
;
 
nor
do
they
bind
themselves
together
in
a
union
which
both
would
have
to
hate
.
<EOS>
"
in
this
way
George
Vavasor
,
try
to
imitate
the
wisdom
of
the
brute
,
have
teach
himself
some
theory
of
a
peculiar
nature
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
as
he
think
of
Alice
Vavasor
on
this
occasion
,
he
begin
to
feel
that
if
a
siamese
twin
be
necessary
for
him
,
she
of
all
other
be
the
woman
to
whom
he
would
wish
to
be
so
bind
.
  
<EOS>
and
if
he
do
it
at
all
,
he
must
do
it
now
.
<EOS>
under
the
joint
instigation
of
himself
and
his
sister
,
 
as
he
think
,
and
perhaps
not
altogether
without
reason
,
 
she
have
break
her
engagement
with
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
that
she
would
renew
it
again
if
leave
to
herself
,
he
believe
probable
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
despite
that
advanced
intelligence
which
have
teach
him
to
regard
all
form
and
ceremony
with
the
eye
of
a
philosopher
,
he
have
still
enough
of
human
frailty
about
him
to
feel
keenly
alive
to
the
pleasure
of
take
from
John
Grey
the
prize
which
John
Grey
have
so
nearly
take
from
him
.
<EOS>
if
Alice
could
have
be
teach
to
think
as
he
do
as
to
the
absurdity
of
those
indissoluble
tie
,
that
would
have
be
well
.
<EOS>
but
nothing
would
have
be
more
impossible
than
the
teaching
of
such
a
lesson
to
his
cousin
Alice
.
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
be
a
man
of
courage
,
and
dare
do
most
thing
;
 
but
he
would
not
have
dare
to
commence
the
teaching
of
such
a
lesson
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
at
this
moment
,
what
be
his
outlook
into
life
generally
?
<EOS>
He
have
very
high
ambition
,
and
a
fair
hope
of
gratify
it
if
he
could
only
provide
that
thing
should
go
well
with
him
for
a
year
or
so
.
<EOS>
He
be
still
a
poor
man
,
have
be
once
nearly
a
rich
man
;
but
still
so
much
of
the
result
of
his
nearly
acquire
rich
remain
to
him
,
that
on
the
strength
of
them
he
may
probably
find
his
way
into
Parliament
.
<EOS>
He
have
pay
the
cost
of
the
last
attempt
,
and
may
,
in
a
great
degree
,
carry
on
this
present
attempt
on
credit
.
<EOS>
if
he
succeed
there
would
be
open
to
him
a
mode
of
life
,
agreeable
in
itself
,
and
honourable
among
man
.
<EOS>
but
how
be
he
to
bear
the
cost
of
this
for
the
next
year
,
or
the
next
two
year
?
<EOS>
His
grandfather
be
still
alive
,
and
would
probably
live
over
that
period
.
<EOS>
if
he
marry
Alice
he
would
do
so
with
no
idea
of
cheat
her
out
of
her
money
.
<EOS>
She
should
learn
,
 
nay
,
she
have
already
learn
from
his
own
lip
,
 
how
perilous
be
his
enterprise
.
<EOS>
but
he
know
her
to
be
a
woman
who
would
boldly
risk
all
in
money
,
though
no
consideration
would
induce
her
to
stir
a
hair
's
breadth
towards
danger
in
reputation
.
<EOS>
towards
teach
her
that
doctrine
at
which
I
have
hint
,
he
would
not
have
dare
to
make
an
attempt
;
but
he
feel
that
he
should
have
no
repugnance
to
tell
her
that
he
want
to
spend
all
her
money
in
the
first
year
or
two
of
their
married
life
!
  
<EOS>
He
be
still
in
his
arm
-
chair
,
think
of
all
this
,
with
that
small
untasted
modicum
of
brandy
and
water
beside
him
,
when
he
hear
some
distant
Lambeth
clock
strike
three
from
over
the
river
.
<EOS>
then
he
rise
from
his
seat
,
and
take
the
candle
in
his
hand
,
sit
himself
down
at
a
writing
-
desk
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
send
it
when
it
be
write
,
"
he
say
to
himself
,
"
and
the
chance
be
that
I
will
not
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
he
take
his
paper
,
and
write
as
follow
:
    
dear
ALICE
,
  
<EOS>
the
time
be
when
the
privilege
be
mine
of
begin
my
letter
to
you
with
a
warm
show
of
love
than
the
above
word
contain
,
 
when
I
may
and
do
call
you
dearest
;
but
I
lose
that
privilege
through
my
own
folly
,
and
since
that
it
have
be
accord
to
another
.
<EOS>
but
you
have
find
,
 
with
a
thorough
honesty
of
purpose
than
which
I
know
nothing
great
,
 
that
it
have
behove
you
to
withdraw
that
privilege
also
.
<EOS>
I
need
hardly
say
that
I
should
not
have
write
as
I
now
write
,
have
you
not
find
it
expedient
to
do
as
you
have
do
.
<EOS>
I
now
once
again
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
all
that
pass
in
those
old
day
,
 
of
all
the
selfish
folly
of
which
I
be
then
guilty
,
I
think
you
know
,
and
at
the
time
know
,
that
I
ever
love
you
.
<EOS>
I
claim
to
say
for
myself
that
my
love
to
you
be
true
from
first
to
last
,
and
I
claim
from
you
belief
for
that
statement
.
<EOS>
indeed
I
do
not
think
that
you
ever
doubt
my
love
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
when
you
tell
me
that
I
may
no
longer
hope
to
make
you
my
wife
,
I
have
no
word
of
remonstrance
that
I
could
utter
.
<EOS>
You
act
as
any
woman
would
act
whom
love
have
not
make
a
fool
.
<EOS>
then
come
the
episode
of
Mr.
Grey
;
and
bitter
as
have
be
my
feeling
whilst
that
engagement
last
,
I
never
make
any
attempt
to
come
between
you
and
the
life
you
have
choose
.
<EOS>
in
say
this
I
do
not
forget
the
word
which
I
speak
last
summer
at
Basle
,
when
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
you
still
intend
that
he
should
be
your
husband
.
<EOS>
but
what
I
say
then
be
nothing
to
that
which
,
with
much
violence
,
I
refrain
from
say
.
<EOS>
whether
you
remember
those
few
word
I
can
not
tell
;
but
certainly
you
would
not
have
remember
them
,
 
would
not
even
have
notice
them
,
 
have
your
heart
be
at
Nethercoats
.
  
<EOS>
but
all
this
be
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
be
now
again
a
free
woman
;
and
once
again
I
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
.
<EOS>
We
be
both
old
than
we
be
when
we
love
before
,
and
will
both
be
prone
to
think
of
marriage
in
a
somewhat
different
light
.
<EOS>
then
personal
love
for
each
other
be
most
in
our
thought
.
<EOS>
God
forbid
that
it
should
not
be
much
in
our
thought
now
!
<EOS>
perhaps
I
be
deceive
myself
in
say
that
it
be
not
even
now
strong
in
mine
than
any
other
consideration
.
<EOS>
but
we
have
both
reach
that
time
of
life
,
when
it
be
probable
that
in
any
proposition
of
marriage
we
should
think
more
of
our
adaptability
to
each
other
than
we
do
before
.
<EOS>
for
myself
I
know
that
there
be
much
in
my
character
and
disposition
to
make
me
unfit
to
marry
a
woman
of
the
common
stamp
.
<EOS>
You
know
my
mode
of
life
,
and
what
be
my
hope
and
my
chance
of
success
.
<EOS>
I
run
great
risk
of
fail
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
I
shall
encounter
ruin
where
I
look
for
reputation
and
a
career
of
honour
.
<EOS>
the
chance
be
perhaps
more
in
favour
of
ruin
than
of
success
.
<EOS>
but
,
whatever
may
be
the
chance
,
I
shall
go
on
as
long
as
any
means
of
carry
on
the
fight
be
at
my
disposal
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
my
wife
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
should
expect
to
use
your
money
,
if
it
be
need
,
in
struggle
to
obtain
a
seat
in
Parliament
and
a
hearing
there
.
<EOS>
I
will
hardly
stoop
to
tell
you
that
I
do
not
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
for
the
sake
of
this
aid
;
 
but
if
you
be
to
become
my
wife
I
should
expect
all
your
cooperation
;
 
with
your
money
,
possibly
,
but
certainly
with
your
warm
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
once
again
,
Alice
,
 
dear
Alice
,
will
you
be
my
wife
?
<EOS>
I
have
be
punish
,
and
I
have
kiss
the
rod
,
 
as
I
never
kiss
any
other
rod
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
accuse
my
love
.
<EOS>
since
the
time
in
which
I
may
sit
with
my
arm
round
your
waist
,
I
have
sit
with
<EOS>
it
round
no
other
waist
.
<EOS>
since
your
lip
be
mine
,
no
other
lip
have
be
dear
to
me
.
<EOS>
since
you
be
my
counsellor
,
I
have
have
no
other
counsellor
,
 
unless
it
be
poor
Kate
,
whose
wish
that
we
may
at
length
be
marry
be
second
in
earnestness
only
to
my
own
.
<EOS>
nor
do
I
think
you
will
doubt
my
repentance
.
<EOS>
such
repentance
indeed
claim
no
merit
,
as
it
have
be
the
natural
result
of
the
loss
which
I
have
suffer
.
<EOS>
Providence
have
hitherto
be
very
good
to
me
in
not
have
make
that
loss
irremediable
by
your
marriage
with
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
now
to
consider
the
matter
well
,
and
to
tell
me
whether
you
can
pardon
me
and
still
love
me
.
<EOS>
do
I
flatter
myself
when
I
feel
that
I
doubt
your
pardon
almost
more
than
I
doubt
your
love
?
  
<EOS>
think
of
this
thing
in
all
its
bearing
before
you
answer
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
anxious
that
you
should
think
of
it
that
I
will
not
expect
your
reply
till
this
day
week
.
<EOS>
It
can
hardly
be
your
desire
to
go
through
life
unmarried
.
<EOS>
I
should
say
that
it
must
be
essential
to
your
ambition
that
you
should
join
your
lot
to
that
of
some
man
the
nature
of
whose
aspiration
would
be
like
to
your
own
.
<EOS>
It
be
because
this
be
not
so
<EOS>
as
regard
him
whose
suit
you
have
accept
,
that
you
find
yourself
at
last
oblige
to
part
from
him
.
<EOS>
May
I
not
say
that
with
us
there
would
be
no
such
difference
?
<EOS>
It
be
because
I
believe
that
in
this
respect
we
be
fit
for
each
other
,
as
man
and
woman
seldom
be
fit
,
that
I
once
again
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
.
  
<EOS>
this
will
reach
you
at
Vavasor
,
where
you
will
now
be
with
the
old
squire
and
Kate
.
<EOS>
I
have
tell
her
nothing
of
my
purpose
in
write
this
letter
.
<EOS>
if
it
should
be
that
your
answer
be
such
as
I
desire
,
I
should
use
the
opportunity
of
our
re
-
engagement
to
endeavour
to
be
reconcile
to
my
grandfather
.
<EOS>
He
have
misunderstand
me
and
have
ill
-
use
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
ready
to
forgive
that
,
if
he
will
allow
me
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
in
such
case
you
and
Kate
would
arrange
that
,
and
I
would
,
if
possible
,
go
down
to
Vavasor
while
you
be
there
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
gallop
on
a
-
head
foolishly
in
thinking
of
this
,
and
be
count
up
my
wealth
while
the
crockery
in
my
basket
be
so
very
fragile
.
<EOS>
one
word
from
you
will
decide
whether
or
no
I
shall
ever
bring
it
into
market
.
  
<EOS>
if
that
word
be
to
be
adverse
do
not
say
anything
of
a
meeting
between
me
and
the
Squire
.
<EOS>
under
such
circumstance
it
would
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
but
,
oh
,
Alice
!
<EOS>
do
not
let
it
be
adverse
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
love
me
.
<EOS>
Your
woman
's
pride
towards
me
have
be
great
and
good
and
womanly
;
but
it
have
have
its
way
;
and
,
if
you
love
me
,
may
now
be
teach
to
succumb
.
  
<EOS>
Dear
Alice
,
will
you
be
my
wife
?
  
<EOS>
Yours
,
in
any
event
,
most

<EOS>
He

passionate

unreasone

specially
impatient

Bowness
and
Windermere
.
<EOS>
They
who
know
the
country
,
and
whose
leg
be
of
use
to
them
,
could
find
some
of
the
grand
scenery
in
England
within
reach
of
a
walk
from
Vavasor
Hall
;
but
to
other
the
place
be
very
desolate
.
<EOS>
for
myself
,
I
can
find
I
know
not
what
of
charm
in
wander
over
open
,
unadorned
moorland
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
more
in
the
softness
of
the
grass
to
the
foot
,
and
the
freshness
of
the
air
to
the
lung
,
than
in
anything
that
meet
the
eye
.
<EOS>
You
may
walk
for
mile
and
mile
to
the
north
-
east
,
or
east
,
or
south
-
east
of
Vavasor
without
meet
any
object
to
arrest
the
view
.
<EOS>
the
great
road
from
Lancaster
to
Carlisle
cross
the
outskirt
of
the
small
parish
about
a
mile
from
the
church
,
and
beyond
that
the
fell
seem
to
be
interminable
.
<EOS>
towards
the
north
it
rise
,
and
towards
the
south
it
fall
,
and
it
rise
and
fall
very
gradually
.
<EOS>
here
and
there
some
slight
appearance
of
a
valley
may
be
trace
which
have
be
form
by
the
action
of
the
water
;
but
such
breaking
of
ground
be
inconsiderable
,
and
do
not
suffice
to
interrupt
the
stern
sameness
of
the
everlasting
moorland
.
  
<EOS>
the
daily
life
at
Vavasor
be
melancholy
enough
for
such
a
one
as
the
Squire
's
son
,
who
regard
London
as
the
only
place
on
the
earth
's
surface
in
which
a
man
could
live
with
comfort
.
<EOS>
the
moor
offer
no
charm
to
him
.
<EOS>
nor
do
he
much
appreciate
the
homely
comfort
of
the
Hall
;
for
the
house
,
though
warm
,
be
old
-
fashioned
and
small
,
and
the
Squire
's
cook
be
nearly
as
old
as
the
Squire
himself
.
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
's
visit
to
Vavasor
be
always
visit
of
duty
rather
than
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
so
with
Alice
.
<EOS>
She
could
be
very
happy
there
with
Kate
;
for
,
like
herself
,
Kate
be
a
good
walker
and
love
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
Their
regard
for
each
other
have
grow
and
become
strong
because
they
have
go
together
o'er
river
and
moor
,
and
because
they
have
together
disregard
those
impediment
of
mud
and
wet
which
frighten
so
many
girl
away
from
the
beauty
of
nature
.
  
<EOS>
on
this
Christmas
Day
they
all
go
to
church
,
the
Squire
be
accompany
by
Alice
in
a
vehicle
which
in
Ireland
be
call
an
inside
jaunting
-
car
,
and
which
be
perhaps
the
most
uncomfortable
kind
of
vehicle
yet
invent
;
while
John
Vavasor
walk
with
his
niece
.
<EOS>
but
the
girl
have
arrange
that
immediately
after
church
they
would
start
for
a
walk
up
the
Beacon
Hill
,
across
the
fell
,
towards
Hawes
Water
.
<EOS>
They
always
dine
at
the
Hall
at
the
vexatious
hour
of
five
;
but
as
their
church
service
,
with
the
sacrament
include
,
would
be
complete
soon
after
twelve
,
and
as
lunch
be
a
meal
which
the
Squire
do
not
himself
attend
,
they
could
have
full
four
hour
for
their
excursion
.
<EOS>
this
have
all
be
plan
before
Alice
receive
her
letter
;
but
there
be
nothing
in
that
to
make
her
change
her
mind
about
the
walk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
my
dear
,
"
say
the
old
man
to
her
when
they
be
together
in
the
jaunting
-
car
,
"
you
ought
to
get
married
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Squire
be
hard
of
hear
,
and
under
any
circumstance
an
inside
jaunting
-
car
be
a
bad
place
for
conversation
,
as
your
tooth
be
nearly
shake
out
of
your
head
by
every
movement
which
the
horse
make
.
<EOS>
Alice
therefore
say
nothing
,
but
smile
faintly
,
in
reply
to
her
grandfather
.
<EOS>
on
return
from
church
he
insist
that
Alice
should
again
accompany
him
,
tell
her
specially
that
he
desire
to
speak
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
My
dear
child
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
have
be
think
a
great
deal
about
you
,
and
you
ought
to
get
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
perhaps
I
shall
some
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
if
you
quarrel
with
all
your
suitor
,
"
say
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
You
quarrel
with
your
cousin
George
,
and
now
you
have
quarrel
with
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
You
will
never
get
married
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
if
you
go
on
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
I
be
marry
more
than
Kate
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
oh
,
Kate
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
anybody
want
to
marry
Kate
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
think
of
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
if
you
do
not
get
marry
before
long
,
perhaps
you
will
never
get
marry
at
all
.
<EOS>
gentleman
will
not
stand
that
kind
of
thing
for
ever
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
two
girl
take
a
slice
of
cake
each
in
her
hand
,
and
start
on
their
walk
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
not
be
able
to
get
to
the
lake
,
"
say
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Alice
;
"
<EOS>
but
we
can
go
as
far
as
the
big
stone
on
Swindale
Fell
,
where
we
can
sit
down
and
see
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
remember
the
last
time
we
sit
there
?
"
say
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
nearly
three
year
ago
,
and
it
be
then
that
you
tell
me
that
all
be
to
be
over
between
you
and
George
.
<EOS>
do
you
remember
what
a
fool
I
be
,
and
how
I
scream
in
my
sorrow
?
<EOS>
I
sometimes
wonder
at
myself
and
my
own
folly
.
<EOS>
how
be
it
that
I
can
never
get
up
any
interest
about
my
own
belonging
?
<EOS>
and
then
we
get
soak
wet
through
come
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
that
very
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
how
dark
it
be
!
<EOS>
that
be
in
September
,
but
we
have
dine
early
.
<EOS>
if
we
go
as
far
as
Swindale
we
shall
have
<EOS>
it
very
dark
come
home
to
-
day
;
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
mind
that
through
the
Beacon
Wood
,
because
I
know
my
way
so
well
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
be
afraid
of
half
an
hour
's
dark
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
do
remember
that
day
.
<EOS>
well
;
it
be
all
for
the
good
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
and
now
I
must
read
you
my
aunt
's
letter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
,
while
they
be
still
in
the
wood
,
Kate
take
out
the
letter
from
her
aunt
and
read
it
,
while
they
still
walk
slowly
up
the
hill
.
<EOS>
It
seem
that
hitherto
neither
of
her
two
suitor
have
bring
the
widow
to
term
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
continue
to
write
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
as
though
that
gentleman
be
inconsolable
for
the
loss
of
Kate
,
and
give
her
niece
much
serious
advice
as
to
the
expedience
of
return
to
Norfolk
,
in
order
that
she
may
secure
so
eligible
a
husband
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
understand
all
the
time
,
Alice
,
"
say
Kate
,
pause
as
she
read
the
letter
,
"
that
the
dear
man
have
never
give
me
the
slight
ground
for
the
faint
hope
,
and
that
I
know
to
a
certainty
that
he
make
an
offer
to
her
twice
a
week
,
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
on
every
market
day
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
enjoy
half
the
joke
if
you
will
not
bear
that
in
mind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
promise
that
she
would
bear
it
all
in
mind
,
and
then
Kate
go
on
with
her
reading
.
<EOS>
poor
Bellfield
be
work
very
hard
at
his
drill
,
Mrs.
Greenow
go
on
to
say
;
so
hard
that
sometimes
she
really
think
the
fatigue
would
be
too
much
for
his
strength
.
<EOS>
He
would
come
in
sometimes
of
an
evening
and
just
take
a
cup
of
tea
;
 
generally
on
Mondays
and
Thursdays
.
<EOS>
"
these
be
not
market
day
at
Norwich
,
"
say
Kate
;
"
and
thus
unpleasant
meeting
be
avoid
.
"
<EOS>
"
He
come
in
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
and
take
a
little
tea
;
and
sometimes
I
think
that
he
will
faint
at
my
foot
.
"
<EOS>
"
that
he
kneel
there
on
every
occasion
,
"
say
Kate
,
"
and
repeat
his
offer
also
twice
a
week
,
I
have
not
the
least
doubt
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
will
she
accept
him
at
last
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
really
I
do
not
know
what
to
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
fancy
that
she
like
the
fun
of
the
thing
,
but
that
she
be
too
wide
-
awake
to
put
herself
in
any
man
's
power
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
she
lend
him
money
,
because
he
want
it
sadly
and
she
be
very
generous
.
<EOS>
She
give
him
money
,
I
feel
sure
,
but
take
his
receipt
on
stamped
paper
for
every
shilling
.
<EOS>
that
be
her
character
all
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
letter
then
go
on
to
say
that
the
writer
have
make
up
her
mind
to
remain
at
Norwich
certainly
through
the
winter
and
spring
,
and
that
she
be
anxiously
desirous
that
her
dear
Kate
should
go
back
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
come
and
have
one
other
look
at
Oileymead
,
"
say
the
letter
,
"
and
then
,
if
you
make
up
your
mind
that
you
do
not
like
it
or
him
,
I
will
not
ask
you
to
think
of
them
ever
again
.
<EOS>
I
believe
him
to
be
a
very
honest
fellow
.
"
<EOS>
"
do
you
ever
know
such
a
woman
?
"
say
Kate
;
"
with
all
her
fault
I
believe
she
would
go
through
fire
and
water
to
serve
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
would
lend
me
money
without
any
stamped
paper
.
"
<EOS>
then
Aunt
Greenow
's
letter
be
put
up
,
and
the
two
girl
have
come
out
upon
the
open
fall
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
delicious
afternoon
for
a
winter
's
walk
.
<EOS>
the
air
be
clear
and
cold
,
but
not
actually
frosty
.
<EOS>
the
ground
beneath
their
foot
be
dry
,
and
the
sky
,
though
not
bright
,
have
that
appearance
of
endure
weather
which
give
no
foreboding
of
rain
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
special
winter
's
light
,
which
be
very
clear
though
devoid
of
all
brilliancy
,
 
through
which
every
object
strike
upon
the
eye
with
well
-
mark
line
,
and
under
which
almost
all
form
of
nature
seem
graceful
to
the
sight
if
not
actually
beautiful
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
certain
melancholy
which
ever
accompany
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
light
of
the
afternoon
,
and
give
token
of
the
speedy
coming
of
the
early
twilight
.
<EOS>
It
tell
of
the
shortness
of
the
day
,
and
contain
even
in
its
clearness
a
promise
of
the
gloom
of
night
.
<EOS>
It
be
absolute
light
,
but
it
seem
to
contain
the
darkness
which
be
to
follow
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
it
be
ever
to
be
see
and
feel
so
plainly
as
on
the
wide
moorland
,
where
the
eye
stretch
away
over
mile
,
and
see
at
the
world
's
end
the
faint
low
line
of
distant
cloud
settle
themselves
upon
the
horizon
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
light
of
this
Christmas
afternoon
,
and
both
the
girl
have
feel
the
effect
of
it
before
they
reach
the
big
stone
on
Swindale
Fell
,
from
which
they
intend
to
look
down
upon
the
loveliness
of
Hawes
Water
.
<EOS>
as
they
go
up
through
the
wood
there
have
be
some
laughter
between
them
over
Aunt
Greenow
's
letter
;
and
they
have
discuss
almost
with
mirth
the
merit
of
Oileymead
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
;
but
as
they
get
further
on
to
the
fell
,
and
as
the
half
-
melancholy
wildness
of
the
place
strike
them
,
their
word
become
less
light
,
and
after
a
while
they
almost
cease
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
have
still
her
letter
in
her
pocket
.
<EOS>
She
have
place
it
there
when
she
come
down
to
breakfast
,
and
have
carry
it
with
her
since
.
<EOS>
She
have
come
to
no
resolution
as
yet
as
to
her
answer
to
it
,
nor
have
she
resolve
whether
or
no
she
would
show
it
to
Kate
.
<EOS>
Kate
have
ever
be
regard
by
her
as
her
steadfast
friend
.
<EOS>
in
all
these
affair
she
have
speak
openly
to
Kate
.
<EOS>
We
know
that
Kate
have
in
part
betray
her
,
but
Alice
suspect
no
such
treason
.
<EOS>
She
have
often
quarrel
with
Kate
;
but
she
have
quarrel
with
her
not
on
account
of
any
sin
against
the
faith
of
their
friendship
.
<EOS>
She
believe
in
her
cousin
perfectly
,
though
she
find
herself
often
call
upon
to
disagree
with
her
almost
violently
.
<EOS>
why
should
she
not
show
this
letter
to
Kate
,
and
discuss
it
in
all
its
bearing
before
she
reply
to
it
?
<EOS>
this
be
in
her
mind
as
she
walk
silently
along
over
the
fell
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
will
surmise
from
this
that
she
be
already
half
inclined
to
give
way
,
and
to
join
her
lot
to
that
of
her
cousin
George
.
<EOS>
alas
,
yes
!
<EOS>
the
reader
will
be
right
in
his
surmise
.
<EOS>
and
yet
it
be
not
her
love
for
the
man
that
prompt
her
to
run
so
terrible
a
risk
.
<EOS>
have
it
be
so
<EOS>
,
I
think
that
it
would
be
easy
to
forgive
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
begin
to
think
that
love
,
 
the
love
of
which
she
have
once
think
so
much
,
 
do
not
matter
.
<EOS>
of
what
use
be
it
,
and
to
what
have
it
lead
?
<EOS>
what
have
love
do
for
her
friend
Glencora
?
<EOS>
what
have
love
do
for
her
?
<EOS>
have
she
not
love
John
Grey
,
and
have
she
not
feel
that
with
all
her
love
life
with
him
would
have
be
distasteful
to
her
?
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
impossible
for
her
to
marry
a
man
whom
personally
she
dislike
;
but
she
like
her
cousin
George
,
 
well
enough
,
as
she
say
to
herself
almost
indifferently
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
it
be
a
grievous
task
to
her
in
these
day
,
 
this
have
to
do
something
with
her
life
.
<EOS>
be
it
not
all
vain
and
futile
?
<EOS>
as
for
that
girl
's
dream
of
the
joy
of
love
which
she
have
once
dream
,
 
that
have
go
from
her
slumber
,
never
to
return
.
<EOS>
how
may
she
best
make
herself
useful
,
 
useful
in
some
sort
that
may
gratify
her
ambition
;
 
that
be
now
the
question
which
seem
to
her
to
be
of
most
importance
.
  
<EOS>
Her
cousin
's
letter
to
her
have
be
very
crafty
.
<EOS>
He
have
study
the
whole
of
her
character
accurately
as
he
write
it
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
sit
down
to
write
it
<EOS>
he
have
be
indifferent
to
the
result
;
but
he
have
write
it
with
that
care
to
attain
success
which
a
man
use
when
he
be
anxious
not
to
fail
in
an
attempt
.
<EOS>
whether
or
no
he
care
to
marry
his
cousin
be
a
point
so
little
interesting
to
him
that
chance
may
decide
it
for
him
;
but
when
chance
have
decide
that
he
do
wish
it
,
it
be
necessary
for
his
honour
that
he
should
have
that
for
which
he
condescend
to
ask
.
  
<EOS>
His
letter
to
her
have
be
clever
and
very
crafty
.
<EOS>
"
at
any
rate
he
do
me
justice
,
"
she
say
to
herself
,
when
she
read
those
word
about
her
money
,
and
the
use
which
he
propose
to
make
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
welcome
to
it
all
if
it
will
help
him
in
his
career
,
whether
he
have
it
as
my
friend
or
as
my
husband
.
"
<EOS>
then
she
think
of
Kate
's
promise
of
her
little
mite
,
and
declare
to
herself
that
she
would
not
be
less
noble
than
her
cousin
Kate
.
<EOS>
and
would
it
not
be
well
that
she
should
be
the
mean
of
reconcile
George
to
his
grandfather
?
<EOS>
George
be
the
representative
of
the
family
,
 
of
a
family
so
old
that
no
one
now
know
which
have
first
take
the
ancient
titular
name
of
some
old
Saxon
landowner
,
 
the
parish
,
or
the
man
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
in
old
day
some
worthy
Vavaseurs
,
as
Chaucer
call
them
,
whose
rank
and
bearing
have
be
adopt
on
the
moorland
side
.
<EOS>
of
these
thing
Alice
think
much
,
and
feel
that
it
should
be
her
duty
so
to
act
,
that
future
vavasor
may
at
any
rate
not
be
less
in
the
world
than
they
who
have
pass
away
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
year
at
furth
,
George
Vavasor
must
be
Vavasor
of
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
right
that
she
should
help
him
to
make
that
position
honourable
?
  
<EOS>
They
walk
on
,
exchange
now
and
again
a
word
or
two
,
till
the
distant
Cumberland
mountain
begin
to
form
themselves
in
group
of
beauty
before
their
eye
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
Helvellyn
at
last
,
"
say
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
always
happy
when
I
see
that
.
"
<EOS>
"
and
be
not
that
Kidsty
Pike
?
"
ask
Alice
.
"
<EOS>
no
;
you
do
not
see
Kidsty
yet
.
<EOS>
but
you
will
when
you
get
up
to
the
bank
there
.
<EOS>
that
be
<EOS>
Scaw
Fell
on
the
left
;
 
the
round
distant
top
.
<EOS>
I
can
distinguish
it
,
though
I
doubt
whether
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
then
they
go
on
again
,
and
be
soon
at
the
bank
from
whence
the
sharp
top
of
the
mountain
which
Alice
have
name
be
visible
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
we
be
on
Swindale
,
and
in
five
minute
we
shall
get
to
the
stone
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
less
than
five
minute
they
be
there
;
and
then
,
but
not
till
then
,
the
beauty
of
the
little
lake
,
lie
down
below
them
in
the
quiet
bosom
of
the
hill
,
disclose
itself
.
<EOS>
a
lake
should
,
I
think
,
be
small
,
and
should
be
see
from
above
,
to
be
see
in
all
its
glory
.
<EOS>
the
distance
should
be
such
that
the
shadow
of
the
mountain
on
its
surface
may
just
be
trace
,
and
that
some
faint
idea
of
the
ripple
on
the
water
may
be
present
to
the
eye
.
<EOS>
and
the
form
of
the
lake
should
be
irregular
,
curve
round
from
its
base
among
the
low
hill
,
deep
and
still
deep
into
some
close
nook
up
among
the
mountain
from
which
its
head
water
spring
.
<EOS>
It
be
thus
that
a
lake
should
be
see
,
and
it
be
thus
that
Hawes
Water
be
see
by
them
from
the
flat
stone
on
the
side
of
Swindale
Fell
.
<EOS>
the
basin
of
the
lake
have
form
itself
into
the
shape
of
the
figure
of
3
,
and
the
top
section
of
the
figure
lie
embosome
among
the
very
wildest
of
the
Westmoreland
mountain
.
<EOS>
altogether
it
be
not
above
three
mile
long
,
and
every
point
of
it
be
to
be
see
from
the
spot
on
which
the
girl
sit
themselves
down
.
<EOS>
the
water
beneath
be
still
as
death
,
and
as
dark
,
 
and
look
almost
as
cold
.
<EOS>
but
the
slow
cloud
be
pass
over
it
,
and
the
shade
of
darkness
on
its
surface
change
themselves
with
gradual
change
.
<EOS>
and
though
no
movement
be
visible
,
there
be
ever
and
again
in
place
a
slight
sheen
upon
the
lake
,
which
indicate
the
ripple
make
by
the
breeze
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
I
have
come
here
,
"
say
Alice
,
seat
herself
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
bear
the
idea
of
come
to
Vavasor
without
see
one
of
the
lake
at
least
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
get
over
to
Windermere
one
day
,
"
say
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
we
shall
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
it
possible
that
I
should
stay
long
.
<EOS>
Kate
,
I
have
get
a
letter
to
show
you
.
"
<EOS>
and
there
be
that
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
which
instantly
put
Kate
upon
her
mettle
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
seat
herself
also
,
and
put
up
her
hand
for
the
letter
.
"
<EOS>
be
it
from
Mr.
Grey
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Alice
;
"
it
be
not
from
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
and
she
give
her
companion
the
paper
.
<EOS>
Kate
before
she
have
touch
it
have
see
that
it
be
from
her
brother
George
;
and
as
she
open
it
look
anxiously
into
Alice
's
face
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
he
offend
you
?
"
<EOS>
Kate
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
read
it
,
"
say
Alice
,
"
and
then
we
will
talk
of
it
afterwards
,
 
as
we
go
home
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
she
get
up
from
the
stone
and
walk
a
step
or
two
towards
the
brow
of
the
fell
,
and
stand
there
look
down
upon
the
lake
,
while
Kate
read
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
when
she
return
to
her
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
Alice
,
it
will
,
indeed
,
be
well
if
you
listen
to
him
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Alice
,
may
I
hope
?
<EOS>
Alice
,
my
own
Alice
,
my
darling
,
my
friend
!
<EOS>
say
that
it
shall
be
so
.
"
<EOS>
and
Kate
kneel
at
her
friend
's
foot
upon
the
heather
,
and
look
up
into
her
face
with
eye
full
of
tear
.
<EOS>
what
shall
we
say
of
a
woman
who
could
be
as
false
as
she
have
be
,
and
yet
could
be
so
true
?
  
<EOS>
Alice
make
no
immediate
answer
,
but
still
continue
to
gaze
down
over
her
friend
upon
the
lake
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
continue
Kate
,
"
I
do
not
think
I
should
be
make
so
happy
<EOS>
this
Christmas
Day
.
<EOS>
You
could
not
have
the
heart
to
bring
me
here
and
show
me
this
letter
in
this
way
,
and
bid
me
read
it
so
calmly
,
and
then
tell
me
that
it
be
all
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
no
;
you
could
not
do
that
?
<EOS>
alice
,
I
be
so
happy

<EOS>
I
will
so
love
this
place
.
<EOS>
I
hate
it
before

"
<EOS>
and
then
she
put
her
face
down
upon
the
boulder
-
stone
and
kiss
it
.
<EOS>
still
Alice
say
nothing
,
but
she
begin
to
feel
that
she
have
go
further
than
she
have
intend
.
<EOS>
It
be
almost
impossible
for
her
now
to
say
that
her
answer
to
George
must
be
a
refusal
.
  
<EOS>
then
Kate
again
go
on
speak
.
"
<EOS>
but
be
it
not
a
beautiful
letter
?
<EOS>
say
,
Alice
,
 
be
it
not
a
letter
of
which
if
you
be
his
brother
you
would
feel
proud
if
another
girl
have
show
it
to
you
?
<EOS>
I
do
feel
proud
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
he
be
a
man
with
a
manly
heart
and
manly
courage
,
who
will
yet
do
manly
thing
.
<EOS>
here
out
on
the
mountain
,
with
nobody
near
us
,
with
Nature
all
round
us
<EOS>
,
I
ask
you
on
your
solemn
word
as
a
woman
,
do
you
love
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
love
him
!
"

Alice

<EOS>
"
yes
;
 
love
him
:
as
a

should
love
her
husband

be
not
your

his

<EOS>
alice
,
there
need
be
no
lie
now

<EOS>
if
it
be
so
,
it
should
be
your
glory
to
say
so

here
,
to
me
,
as
you
hold
that
letter
in
your
hand

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
have
no
such
glory

Kate

I
have
ever
love
my
cousin

not
so
passionately
as
you
seem
to
think

then
there
can
be
no
passion
in
you

perhaps
not

Kate

<EOS>
I
would
sometimes
hope
that
it
be
so

come
;
we
shall
be
late
;

you
will
be
cold

there

I
would

here
all
night
to
be
sure

,
Alice

at
any

shall
tell
me
before
I
move
what
your

be

me
happy

so

why
not

on
such
a
subject

under
such
circumstance
a

must
resolve
at
the
first
moment

<EOS>
You
have
resolve
,
I
know
,
before
you
have
half
read
the
letter

,
perhaps
,
it
may
not
suit
you
to
say
so

You

quite
mistaken

come
along

walk

then
Kate
arise
,

they
turn
their
back
to
the
lake

begin
to
make
their
way
homeward

"
I
have
not
make
up
my
mind
as
to
what
answer
I
will
give
him

I
have
show
you
his
letter
in
order
that
I
may
have
some
one
with
whom
I
may
speak
openly
.
<EOS>
I
know
well
how
it
would
be

that
you

hurry
me
into
an
immediate
promise

<EOS>
"
no

no

;
I
want
nothing
of
the
kind

myself
the
comfort

your
friendship

no

Alice

I
will
not
hurry
you
.

I
will
do
nothing
that
you
do
not
wish

<EOS>
but
you
can
not
be
surprised
that
I
should
be
very
eager
.
<EOS>
have
it
not
be
the
longing
of
all
my
life
?
<EOS>
have
I
not
pass
my
time
plot
and
planning
and
thinking
of
it
till
I
have
have
time
to
think
of
nothing
else

do
you
know
what
I
suffer
when
,
through
George

fault

the
engagement
be
break
off

be
it
not
martyrdom
to
me

that
horrid
time
in
which
your
Crichton
from
Cambridgeshire
be
in
the
ascendant

I
not
suffer
the
torture
of
purgatory
while
that
go
on

yet
,
on
the
whole
,
do
I
not
bear
them
with
patience

<EOS>
and
,
now
,
can
you
be
surprised

I
be
wild
with
joy
when
I
begin
to
see
that
everything
will
be
as
I
wish

it
will
be

It
may
be
that
you
have
not
resolve
to
accept
him

<EOS>
but
you
would
have
resolve
to
refuse
him
instantly
have
<EOS>
that
be
your
destine
answer
to
his
letter

<EOS>
"
there
be
but
little
more
say
between
them
on
the
subject
as
they
be
pass
over
the
fell
,

when
they
be
go
down
the
path
through
the
Beacon
Wood

Kate
again
speak

at

not

my
answer
without
tell

you
will
let
me
see
it

<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"

Alice

"
I
will
not

that

if
it
be
unfavourable
I
will
show
it
you
.

"
then
I
shall
never
see
it

Kate

that
be
quite
enough
for
me

<EOS>
I
by
no

wish
to
criticise
the
love

sweet
word
in
which
you
tell
him
that
his
offence

all
forgive

I

how
sweet
they

oh

how
I

meet
them
at

glower
at
them
angrily
from
out
his
old
leonine
eye

the
roast
beef

already
roast

He

his
great
uncouth
silver
watch
in

be
always
a
quarter

too
fast

grandpapa
,
you
be
always
too
fast
,
"
say
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
be
always
too
slow
,
miss
,
"
say
the
hungry
old
squire
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
it
be
not
five
yet
.
<EOS>
be
it
,
Alice
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
how
long
be
you
go
to
be
dress
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
ten
minute
;
 
be
we
,
Alice
?
<EOS>
and
,
grandpapa
,
pray
do
not
wait
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
wait
!
<EOS>
that
be
what
they
always
say
,
"
he
mutter
,
peevishly
.
"
<EOS>
as
if
one
would
be
any
well
wait
for
them
after
the
meat
be
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
but
neither
Kate
nor
Alice
hear
this
,
as
they
be
already
in
their
room
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
more
be
say
that
evening
between
Alice
and
Kate
about
the
letter
;
but
Kate
,
as
she
wish
her
cousin
good
night
inside
her
bedroom
door
,
speak
to
her
just
one
word
 
<EOS>
"
pray
for
him
to
-
night
,
"
she
say
,
"
as
you
pray
for
those
you
love
best
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
make
no
answer
,
but
we
may
believe
that
she
do
as
she
be
desire
to
do
.
   
<EOS>
contain
an
answer
to
the
Love
Letter
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
have
have
a
week
allow
to
her
to
write
her
answer
;
but
she
send
it
off
before
the
full
week
be
past
.
<EOS>
"
why
should
I
keep
him
in
suspense
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
to
be
so
,
there
can
be
no
good
in
not
say
so
at
once
.
"
<EOS>
then
she
think
,
also
,
that
if
this
be
to
be
her
destiny
it
may
be
well
for
Mr.
Grey
that
all
his
doubt
on
the
matter
should
be
dispel
.
<EOS>
She
have
treat
him
badly
,
 
very
badly
.
<EOS>
She
have
so
injure
him
that
the
remembrance
of
the
injury
must
always
be
a
source
of
misery
to
her
;
but
she
owe
to
him
above
everything
to
let
him
know
what
be
her
intention
as
soon
as
they
be
settle
.
<EOS>
She
try
to
console
herself
by
think
that
the
wound
to
him
would
be
easy
to
cure
.
"
<EOS>
He
also
be
not
passionate
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
but
in
so
say
she
deceive
herself
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
in
whom
Love
could
be
very
passionate
;
 
and
be
,
moreover
,
one
in
whom
Love
could
hardly
be
renew
.
  
<EOS>
each
morning
Kate
ask
her
whether
her
answer
be
write
;
and
on
the
third
day
after
Christmas
,
just
before
dinner
,
Alice
say
that
she
have
write
it
,
and
that
it
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
not
post
-
day
,
"
say
Kate
;
 
for
the
post
illuminate
Vavasor
but
three
day
a
week
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
give
a
boy
sixpence
to
take
it
to
Shap
,
"
say
Alice
,
blush
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
have
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
ask
Kate
,
take
hold
of
the
other
's
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
keep
my
promise
,
"
say
Alice
;
"
and
do
you
keep
yours
by
ask
no
further
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
sister
,
 
my
own
sister
,
"
say
Kate
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
as
Alice
meet
her
embrace
,
there
be
no
longer
any
doubt
as
to
the
nature
of
the
reply
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
there
be
of
course
much
close
discussion
between
them
as
to
what
other
step
should
now
be
take
.
<EOS>
Kate
want
her
cousin
to
write
immediately
to
Mr.
Grey
,
and
be
somewhat
frightened
when
Alice
decline
to
do
so
till
she
have
receive
a
further
letter
from
George
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
propose
any
horrid
stipulation
to
him
?
"
exclaim
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
you
may
call
horrid
stipulation
,
"
say
Alice
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
My
condition
have
not
be
very
hard
,
and
I
do
not
think
you
would
have
disapprove
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
he
!
 
<EOS>
He
be
so
impetuous
!
<EOS>
Will
he
disapprove
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
tell
him
 
<EOS>
but
,
Kate
,
this
be
just
what
I
do
not
mean
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
there
be
secret
between
us
?
"
say
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
shall
be
none
,
then
.
<EOS>
I
have
tell
him
that
I
can
not
bring
myself
to
marry
him
instantly
;
 
that
he
must
allow
me
twelve
month
to
wear
off
,
if
I
can
in
that
time
,
much
of
sadness
and
of
self
-
reproach
which
have
fall
to
my
lot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
twelve
month
,
Alice
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
say
so
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
tell
him
also
that
if
he
wish
it
still
,
I
will
at
once
tell
papa
and
grandpapa
that
I
hold
myself
as
engage
to
him
,
so
that
he
may
know
that
I
bind
myself
to
him
as
far
as
it
be
possible
that
I
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
and
I
have
add
something
else
,
Kate
,
"
she
continue
to
say
after
a
slight
pause
,
 
"
something
else
which
I
can
tell
you
,
though
I
could
tell
it
to
no
other
person
.
<EOS>
I
can
tell
you
because
you
would
do
,
and
will
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
I
have
tell
him
that
any
portion
of
my
money
be
at
his
service
which
may
be
need
for
his
purpose
before
that
twelve
month
be
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Alice
!
<EOS>
no
;
 
no
.
<EOS>
You
shall
not
do
that
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
generous
.
"
<EOS>
and
Kate
perhaps
feel
at
the
moment
that
her
brother
be
a
man
to
whom
such
an
offer
could
hardly
be
make
with
safety
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
have
do
it
.
<EOS>
Mercury
,
with
sixpence
in
his
pocket
,
be
already
post
my
generosity
at
Shap
.
<EOS>
and
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
Kate
,
it
be
no
more
than
fair
.
<EOS>
He
have
honestly
tell
me
that
while
the
old
Squire
live
he
will
want
my
money
to
assist
him
in
a
career
of
which
I
do
much
more
than
approve
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
my
earnest
wish
to
see
him
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
It
will
now
be
the
most
earnest
desire
of
my
heart
;
 
the
one
thing
as
to
which
I
shall
feel
an
intense
anxiety
.
<EOS>
how
then
can
I
have
the
face
to
bid
him
<EOS>
wait
twelve
month
for
that
which
be
specially
need
in
six
month
"
time
?
<EOS>
It
would
be
like
the
workhouse
which
be
so
long
in
give
bread
,
that
in
the
mean
time
the
wretch
starve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
the
wretch
shall
not
starve
,
"
say
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
My
money
,
small
as
it
be
,
will
carry
him
over
this
bout
.
<EOS>
I
have
tell
him
that
he
shall
have
it
,
and
that
I
expect
him
to
spend
it
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
I
have
no
doubt
that
Aunt
Greenow
would
lend
me
what
he
want
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
should
not
wish
him
to
borrow
from
Aunt
Greenow
.
<EOS>
She
would
advance
him
the
money
,
as
you
say
,
upon
stamped
paper
,
and
then
talk
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
shall
have
mine
,
"
say
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
who
be
you
?
"
say
Alice
,
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
go
to
be
his
wife
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
shall
not
touch
your
money
till
you
be
his
wife
,
"
say
Kate
,
very
seriously
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
consent
to
change
your
mind
about
this
stupid
tedious
year
,
and
then
you
may
do
as
you
pleased
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
such
a
settlement
may
be
make
as
to
the
property
here
,
when
my
grandfather
hear
of
it
,
as
would
make
you
ultimately
safe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
you
think
I
care
to
be
ultimately
safe
,
as
you
call
it
?
<EOS>
Kate
,
my
dear
,
you
do
not
understand
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
not
.
<EOS>
and
yet
I
think
that
I
have
know
something
about
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
because
I
do
not
care
for
the
safety
of
which
you
speak
that
I
be
now
go
to
become
your
brother
's
wife
.
<EOS>
do
you
suppose
that
I
do
not
see
that
I
must
run
much
risk
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
prefer
the
excitement
of
London
to
the
tranquillity
,
may
I
say
,
of
Cambridgeshire
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
exactly
;
 
and
therefore
I
have
tell
George
that
he
shall
have
my
money
whenever
he
want
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Kate
be
very
persistent
in
her
objection
to
this
scheme
till
George
's
answer
come
.
<EOS>
His
answer
to
Alice
be
accompany
by
a
letter
to
his
sister
,
and
after
that
Kate
say
nothing
more
about
the
money
question
.
<EOS>
She
say
no
more
then
;
but
it
must
not
therefore
be
suppose
that
she
be
less
determined
than
she
have
be
that
no
part
of
Alice
's
fortune
should
be
sacrifice
to
her
brother
's
want
;
 
at
any
rate
before
Alice
should
become
her
brother
's
wife
.
<EOS>
but
her
brother
's
letter
for
the
moment
stop
her
mouth
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
necessary
that
she
should
speak
to
him
before
she
again
speak
to
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
in
what
word
Alice
have
write
her
assent
it
will
be
necessary
that
the
reader
should
know
,
in
order
that
something
may
be
understand
of
the
struggle
which
she
make
upon
the
occasion
;
but
they
shall
be
give
presently
,
when
I
come
to
speak
of
George
Vavasor
's
position
as
he
receive
them
.
<EOS>
George
's
reply
be
very
short
and
apparently
very
frank
.
<EOS>
He
deprecate
the
delay
of
twelve
month
,
and
still
hope
to
be
able
to
induce
her
to
be
more
lenient
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
advise
her
to
write
to
Mr.
Grey
at
once
,
 
and
as
regard
the
Squire
he
give
her
_
carte
<EOS>
blanche
_
to
act
as
she
please
.
<EOS>
if
the
Squire
require
any
kind
of
apology
,
expression
of
sorrow
,
 
and
ask
for
pardon
,
or
such
like
,
he
,
George
,
would
,
under
the
circumstance
as
they
now
exist
,
comply
with
the
requisition
most
willingly
.
<EOS>
He
would
regard
it
as
a
simple
form
,
make
necessary
by
his
come
marriage
.
<EOS>
as
to
Alice
's
money
,
he
thank
her
heartily
for
her
confidence
.
<EOS>
if
the
nature
of
his
come
contest
at
Chelsea
should
make
it
necessary
,
he
would
use
her
offer
as
frankly
as
it
have
be
make
.
<EOS>
such
be
his
letter
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
what
be
contain
in
his
letter
to
Kate
,
Alice
never
know
.
  
<EOS>
then
come
the
business
of
tell
this
new
love
tale
,
 
<EOS>
the
third
which
poor
Alice
have
be
force
to
tell
her
father
and
grandfather
;
 
and
a
grievous
task
it
be
.
<EOS>
in
this
matter
she
fear
her
father
much
more
than
her
grandfather
,
and
therefore
she
resolve
to
tell
her
grandfather
first
;
 
or
,
rather
,
she
determine
that
she
would
tell
the
Squire
,
and
that
in
the
mean
time
Kate
should
talk
to
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
Grandpapa
,
"
she
say
to
him
the
morning
after
she
have
receive
her
cousin
's
second
letter
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
be
in
the
habit
of
breakfast
alone
in
a
closet
of
his
own
,
which
be
call
his
dressing
-
room
,
but
in
which
he
keep
no
appurtenance
for
dressing
,
but
in
lieu
of
them
a
large
collection
of
old
spud
and
stick
and
horse'
-
bit
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
broken
spade
here
,
and
a
hoe
or
two
;
and
a
small
table
in
the
corner
be
cover
with
the
debris
of
tradesman
's
bill
from
Penrith
,
and
dirty
scrap
which
he
be
will
not
to
call
his
farm
account
.
 
<EOS>
"
Grandpapa
,
"
say
Alice
,
rush
away
at
once
into
the
middle
of
her
subject
,
"
you
tell
me
the
other
day
that
you
think
I
ought
to
be
 
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
I
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
well
,
yes
;
so
I
do
.
<EOS>
and
so
you
ought
;
 
I
mean
to
that
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
impossible
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
what
be
the
use
of
your
come
and
talk
to
me
about
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
this
make
Alice
's
task
not
very
easy
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
she
persevere
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
come
,
grandpapa
,
to
tell
you
of
another
engagement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
another
!
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
and
by
the
tone
of
his
voice
he
accuse
his
granddaughter
of
have
a
large
number
of
favour
suitor
than
ought
to
fall
to
the
lot
of
any
young
lady
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
hard
upon
her
,
but
still
she
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
"
say
she
,
"
that
some
year
ago
I
be
to
have
be
marry
to
my
cousin
George
;
"
 
and
then
she
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
the
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
remember
you
tell
me
then
that
you
be
much
pleased
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
be
.
<EOS>
George
be
do
well
then
;
or
,
 
which
be
more
likely
,
 
have
make
us
believe
that
he
be
do
well
.
<EOS>
have
you
make
it
up
with
him
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
that
be
the
meaning
of
your
jilt
Mr.
Grey
,
be
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
poor
Alice
!
<EOS>
It
be
hard
to
explain
how
heavy
a
blow
fall
upon
her
from
the
open
utterance
of
that
word
!
<EOS>
of
all
word
in
the
language
it
be
the
one
which
she
now
most
dreaded
.
<EOS>
She
have
call
herself
a
jilt
,
with
that
inaudible
voice
which
one
use
in
make
self
-
accusation
;
 
but
hitherto
no
lip
have
pronounce
the
odious
word
to
her
ear
.
<EOS>
poor
Alice
!
<EOS>
She
be
a
jilt
;
and
perhaps
it
may
have
be
well
that
the
old
man
should
tell
her
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
Grandpapa
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
;
and
there
be
that
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
which
somewhat
soften
the
Squire
's
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
,
I
do
not
want
to
be
ill
-
natured
.
<EOS>
so
you
be
go
at
last
to
marry
George
,
be
you
?
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
treat
you
well
;
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
do
your
father
approve
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
tell
you
first
,
sir
;
 
because
I
wish
to
obtain
your
consent
to
see
George
again
here
as
your
grandson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
never

say
the
old
man
,
snarl
;
 
"
never
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
he
have
be
wrong
,
he
will
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
he
have
be
wrong
!
<EOS>
do
not
he
want
to
squander
every
shilling
of
the
property
,
 
property
which
have
never
belong
to
him
;
 
property
which
I
could
give
to
Tom
,
Dick
,
or
Harry
to
-
morrow
,
if
I
like
?
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
be
wrong
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
defend
him
,
sir
;
 
but
I
think
that
,
perhaps
,
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
 
"
  
"
a
Tom
Fool
's
occasion
!
<EOS>
You
have
get
money
of
your
own
.
<EOS>
He
will
spend
all
that
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
will
be
less
likely
to
do
so
if
you
will
recognise
him
as
your
heir
.
<EOS>
pray
believe
,
sir
,
that
he
be
not
the
sort
of
man
that
he
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
must
be
a
very
clever
sort
of
man
,
I
think
,
when
he
have
talk
you
out
of
such
a
husband
as
John
Grey
.
<EOS>
It
be
astounding
to
me
,
 
with
that
ugly
mug
of
his
!
<EOS>
well
,
my
dear
,
if
your
father
approve
of
it
,
and
if
George
will
ask
my
pardon
,
 
but
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
he
ever
will
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
be
his
messenger
for
as
much
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
you
be
,
be
you
?
<EOS>
then
you
may
also
be
my
messenger
to
him
,
and
tell
him
that
,
for
your
sake
,
I
will
let
him
come
back
here
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
will
insult
me
the
first
day
;
but
I
will
try
and
put
up
with
it
,
 
for
your
sake
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
must
know
what
your
father
think
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
imagine
that
Kate
's
success
be
even
less
than
that
which
Alice
achieve
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
would
be
so
,
"
say
John
Vavasor
,
when
his
niece
first
tell
him
;
 
<EOS>
and
as
he
speak
he
strike
his
hand
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
all
along
how
it
would
be
.
"
  
"
and
why
should
it
not
be
so
,
Uncle
John
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
your
brother
,
and
I
will
not
tell
you
why
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
that
he
be
a
spendthrift
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
he
be
as
unsafe
a
man
as
ever
<EOS>
I
know
to
be
intrust
with
the
happiness
of
any
young
woman

<EOS>
that
be
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
hard
upon
him
,
uncle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
so
.
<EOS>
tell
Alice
this
from
me
,
 
that
as
I
have
never
yet
be
able
to
get
her
to
think
anything
of
my
opinion
,
I
do
not
at
all
expect
that
I
shall
be
able
to
induce
her
to
do
so
now
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
even
make
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
as
my
son
-
in
-
law
I
will
not
receive
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
tell
Alice
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
be
tell
her
father
's
message
;
but
Kate
in
tell
it
feel
no
deep
regret
.
<EOS>
She
well
know
that
Alice
would
not
be
turn
back
from
her
present
intention
by
her
father
's
wish
.
<EOS>
nor
would
it
have
be
very
reasonable
that
she
should
.
<EOS>
Her
father
have
for
many
year
relieve
himself
from
the
burden
of
a
father
's
care
,
and
now
have
hardly
the
right
to
claim
a
father
's
privilege
.
  
<EOS>
We
will
now
go
once
again
to
George
Vavasor
's
room
in
Cecil
Street
,
in
which
he
receive
Alice
's
letter
.
<EOS>
He
be
dress
when
it
be
first
bring
to
him
;
and
when
he
recognise
the
handwriting
he
put
it
down
on
his
toilet
table
unopened
.
<EOS>
He
put
it
down
,
and
go
on
brush
his
hair
,
as
though
he
be
determined
to
prove
to
himself
that
he
be
indifferent
as
to
the
tiding
which
it
may
contain
.
<EOS>
He
go
on
brush
his
hair
,
and
clean
his
tooth
,
and
tie
his
cravat
carefully
over
his
turn
-
down
collar
,
while
the
unopened
letter
lie
close
to
his
hand
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
be
think
of
it
,
 
<EOS>
of
course
he
be
anxious
,
 
<EOS>
of
course
his
eye
go
to
it
from
moment
to
moment
.
<EOS>
but
he
carry
it
with
him
into
the
sit
-
room
still
unopene
,
and
so
it
remain
until
after
the
girl
have
bring
him
his
tea
and
his
toast
.
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
"
say
he
,
as
he
throw
himself
into
his
arm
-
chair
,
"
let
us
see
what
the
girl
of
my
heart
say
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
the
girl
of
his
heart
say
to
him
as
follow
:
    
my
dear
george
,
  
<EOS>
I
feel
great
difficulty
in
answer
your
letter
.
<EOS>
Could
I
have
my
own
way
,
I
should
make
no
answer
to
it
at
present
,
but
leave
it
for
the
next
six
month
,
so
that
then
such
answer
may
hereafter
be
make
as
circumstance
should
seem
to
require
.
<EOS>
this
will
be
little
flattering
to
you
,
but
it
be
less
flattering
to
myself
.
<EOS>
whatever
answer
I
may
make
,
how
can
anything
in
this
affair
be
flattering
either
to
you
or
to
me
?
<EOS>
We
have
be
like
child
who
have
quarrel
over
our
game
of
play
,
till
now
,
at
the
close
of
our
little
day
of
pleasure
,
we
be
fain
to
meet
each
other
in
tear
,
and
acknowledge
that
we
have
look
for
delight
where
no
delight
be
to
be
find
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
,
who
be
here
,
talk
to
me
of
passionate
love
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
such
passion
leave
to
me
;
 
nor
,
as
I
think
,
to
you
either
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
now
be
possible
that
you
and
I
should
come
together
on
such
term
as
that
.
<EOS>
We
could
not
stand
up
together
as
man
and
wife
with
any
hope
of
a
happy
marriage
,
unless
we
have
both
agree
that
such
happiness
may
be
have
without
passionate
love
.
  
<EOS>
You
will
see
from
all
this
that
I
do
not
refuse
your
offer
.
<EOS>
without
passion
,
I
have
for
you
a
warm
affection
,
which
enable
me
to
take
a
lively
interest
in
your
career
than
in
any
other
of
the
matter
which
be
around
me
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
if
I
become
your
wife
that
interest
will
be
still
close
and
dearer
,
and
I
do
feel
that
I
can
take
in
it
that
concern
which
a
wife
should
have
in
her
husband
's
affair
.
  
<EOS>
if
it
suit
you
,
I
will
become
your
wife
;
 
but
it
can
not
be
quite
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
have
suffer
much
from
the
past
conflict
of
my
life
,
and
there
have
be
very
much
with
which
I
must
reproach
myself
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
have
behave
badly
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
have
to
undergo
the
doubly
bitter
self
-
accusation
of
have
behave
in
a
manner
which
the
world
will
call
unfeminine
.
<EOS>
You
must
understand
that
I
have
not
pass
through
this
unscathed
,
and
I
must
beg
you
to
allow
me
some
time
for
a
cure
.
<EOS>
a
perfect
cure
<EOS>
I
may
never
expect
,
but
I
think
that
in
twelve
month
from
this
time
I
may
so
far
have
recover
my
usual
spirit
and
ease
of
mind
as
to
enable
me
to
devote
myself
to
your
happiness
.
<EOS>
Dear
George
,
if
you
will
accept
me
under
such
circumstance
,
I
will
be
your
wife
,
and
will
endeavour
to
do
my
duty
by
you
faithfully
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
say
that
even
now
,
as
your
cousin
,
I
take
a
lively
interest
in
your
career
,
 
of
course
<EOS>
I
mean
your
career
as
a
politician
,
 
and
especially
in
your
hope
of
enter
Parliament
.
<EOS>
I
understand
,
accurately
as
I
think
,
what
you
have
say
about
my
fortune
,
and
I
perfectly
appreciate
your
truth
and
frankness
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
nothing
of
my
own
you
,
in
your
circumstance
,
could
not
possibly
take
me
as
your
wife
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
moreover
,
that
your
need
of
assistance
from
my
means
be
immediate
rather
than
prospective
.
<EOS>
My
money
may
be
absolutely
necessary
to
you
within
this
year
,
during
which
,
as
I
tell
you
most
truly
,
I
can
not
bring
myself
to
become
a
married
woman
.
<EOS>
but
my
money
shall
be
less
cross
-
grained
than
myself
.
<EOS>
You
will
take
it
as
frankly
as
I
mean
it
when
I
say
,
that
whatever
you
want
for
your
political
purpose
shall
be
forthcoming
at
your
slight
wish
.
<EOS>
Dear
George
,
let
me
have
the
honour
and
glory
of
marry
a
man
who
have
gain
a
seat
in
the
Parliament
of
Great
Britain
!
<EOS>
of
all
position
which
a
man
may
attain
that
,
to
me
,
be
the
grand
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
wait
for
a
further
letter
from
you
before
I
speak
either
to
my
father
or
to
my
grandfather
.
<EOS>
if
you
can
tell
me
that
you
accede
to
my
view
,
I
will
at
once
try
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
between
you
and
the
Squire
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
that
will
be
almost
easy
than
induce
my
father
to
look
with
favour
upon
our
marriage
.
<EOS>
but
I
need
hardly
say
that
should
either
one
or
the
other
oppose
it
,
 
or
should
both
do
so
,
 
that
would
not
turn
me
from
my
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
I
also
wait
for
your
answer
to
write
a
last
line
to
Mr.
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
Your
affectionate
cousin
,
  
ALICE
VAVASOR
.
  
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
when
he
have
read
the
letter
throw
it
carelessly
from
him
on
to
the
breakfast
table
,
and
begin
to
munch
his
toast
.
<EOS>
He
throw
it
carelessly
from
him
,
as
though
take
a
certain
pride
in
his
carelessness
.
"
<EOS>
very
well
,
"
say
he
;
"
so
be
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
probably
the
good
thing
that
I
could
do
,
whatever
the
effect
may
be
on
her
.
"
<EOS>
then
he
take
up
his
newspaper
.
<EOS>
but
before
the
day
be
over
he
have
make
many
plan
,
 
plan
make
almost
unconsciously
,
 
as
to
the
benefit
which
may
accrue
to
him
from
the
offer
which
she
have
make
of
her
money
.
<EOS>
and
before
night
he
have
write
that
reply
to
her
of
which
we
have
hear
the
content
;
and
have
write
also
to
his
sister
Kate
a
letter
,
of
which
Kate
have
keep
the
content
to
herself
.
   
<EOS>
Monkshade
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
first
of
the
new
year
come
round
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
be
not
keep
her
appointment
at
Lady
Monk
's
house
.
<EOS>
She
go
to
Gatherum
Castle
,
and
let
us
hope
that
she
enjoy
the
magnificent
Christmas
hospitality
of
the
Duke
;
but
when
the
time
come
for
move
on
to
Monkshade
,
she
be
indispose
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
go
thither
alone
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
return
to
Matching
and
remain
at
home
,
while
her
husband
be
away
,
in
company
with
the
two
Miss
Pallisers
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
tiding

Monkshade
that
Lady
Glencora
be
not
to

,
Burgo
Fitzgerald
be
already
there
,
arm
with
such
pecuniary
assistance
as
George
Vavasor
have
be
able
to
wrench
out
of
the
hand
of
Mr.
Magruin
.
<EOS>
"
Burgo
,
"
say
his
aunt
,
catch
him
one
morning
near
his
bedroom
door
as
he
be
about
to
go
down
-
stair
in
hunt
trim
,
"
Burgo
,
your
old
flame
,
Lady
Glencora
,
be
not
come
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Glencora
not
come
!
"
<EOS>
say
Burgo
,
betray
by
his
look
and
the
tone
of
his
voice
too
clearly
that
this
change
in
the
purpose
of
a
married
lady
be
to
him
of
more
importance
than
it
should
have
be
.
<EOS>
such
betrayal
,
however
,
to
Lady
Monk
be
not
perhaps
matter
of
much
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
;
she
be
not
come
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
matter
of
any
moment
to
you
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
by
heaven
,
it
be
,
"
say
he
,
put
his
hand
up
to
his
forehead
,
and
lean
back
against
the
wall
of
the
passage
as
though
in
despair
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
matter
of
moment
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
the
most
unfortunate
devil
that
ever
live
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fie
,
Burgo
,
fie
!
<EOS>
You
must
not
speak
in
that
way
of
a
married
woman
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
it
be
well
that
she
should
not
come
.
"
<EOS>
at
this
moment
another
man
boot
and
spur
come
down
the
passage
,
upon
whom
Lady
Monk
smile
sweetly
,
speak
some
pretty
little
word
as
he
pass
.
<EOS>
Burgo
speak
never
a
word
,
but
still
stand
lean
against
the
wall
,
with
his
hand
to
his
forehead
,
show
that
he
have
hear
something
which
have
move
him
greatly
.
<EOS>
"
come
back
into
your
room
,
Burgo
,
"
say
his
aunt
;
and
they
both
go
in
at
the
door
that
be
near
to
them
,
for
Lady
Monk
have
be
on
the
look

out
for
him
,
and
have
catch
him
as
soon
as
he
appear
in
the

if
this

you
would
not

I
suppose

<EOS>
I
think
it
best
to
tell
you
,
for
fear
you
should
show
any
special
sign
of
surprise
if
you
hear
of
it
first
in
public

<EOS>
It
be
very
weak
in
you
to
allow
yourself
to
feel
that
sort
of
regard
for
a
married
woman

if
you
can
not

yourself
I
shall
be
afraid

You
can

Nonsense

Burgo

do
you

breakfast

Lady
Monk
be
a
woman
now
about
fifty
year
of
age
,
who
have
be
a
great
beauty
,
and
who
be
still
handsome
in
her
advanced
age
.
<EOS>
Her
figure
be
very
good
.
<EOS>
She
be
tall
and
of
fine
proportion
,
though
by
no
mean
verge
to
that
state
of
body
which
our
excellent
american
friend
and
critic
Mr.
Hawthorne
have
describe
as
beefy
and
have
declare
to
be
the
general
condition
of
english
lady
of
Lady
Monk
's
age
.
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
be
not
beefy
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
comely
,
handsome
,
upright
,
dame
,
 
one
of
whom
,
as
regard
her
outward
appearance
,
England
may
be
proud
,
 
and
of
whom
Sir
Cosmo
Monk
be
very
proud
.
<EOS>
She
have
come
of
the
family
of
the
Worcestershire
Fitzgeralds
,
of
whom
it
use
to
be
say
that
there
never
be
one
who
be
not
beautiful
and
worthless
.
<EOS>
look
at
Lady
Monk
you
would
hardly
think
that
she
could
be
a
worthless
woman
;
but
there
be
one
or
two
who
profess
to
know
her
,
and
who
declare
that
she
be
a
true
scion
of
the
family
to
which
she
belong
;
 
that
even
her
husband
's
ample
fortune
have
suffer
from
her
extravagance
,
that
she
have
quarrel
with
her
only
son
,
and
have
succeed
in
marry
her
daughter
to
the
great
fool
in
the
peerage
.
<EOS>
She
have
strive
very
hard
to
bring
about
a
marriage
between
her
nephew
and
the
great
heiress
,
and
be
a
woman
not
likely
to
pardon
those
who
have
foil
her
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
moment
Burgo
feel
very
certain
that
his
aunt
be
aware
of
his
purpose
,
and
could
not
forgive
her
for
pretend
to
be
innocent
of
it
.
<EOS>
in
this
he
be
most
ungrateful
,
as
well
as
unreasonable
,
 
and
very
indiscreet
also
.
<EOS>
have
he
be
a
man
who
ever
reflect
he
must
have
know
that
such
a
woman
as
his
aunt
could
only
assist
him
as
long
as
she
may
be
presume
to
be
ignorant
of
his
intention
.
<EOS>
but
Burgo
never
reflect
.
<EOS>
the
Fitzgeralds
never
reflect
till
they
be
nearer
forty
than
thirty
,
and
then
people
begin
to
think
bad
of
them
than
they
have
think
before
.
  
<EOS>
when
Burgo
reach
the
dining

room
there
be
many
man
there
,
but
no

head
hale
man
of
about
sixty

be

huge

<EOS>
He
be
a
man
also
who
do
not
reflect
much
,
but
who
contrive
to
keep
straight
in
his
course
through
the
world
without
much
reflection
.
<EOS>
"
Palliser
be
come
without

"
he
say
in
his
loud
clear
voice
,
think
nothing

I

We

<EOS>
Sir

be
the

He
have
once

Treasury

and
have
since
always
speak
of
the
Whig
Government
as
though
he
himself
be
in
some
sort
a
part
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Burgo
,
do
you
hear
that
Palliser
be
come
without
his
wife
?
"
say
one
man
,
 
a
very
young
man
,
who
hardly
know
what
have
be
the
circumstance
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
the
other
,
when
they
see
Burgo
enter
,
have
be
silent
on
the
subject
of
Lady
Glencora

<EOS>
"
I
have
hear

and
be
d

d

Burgo

<EOS>
then
there
be
suddenly
a
silence
in
the
room
,
and
everyone
seem
to
attend
assiduously
to
his
breakfast
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
terrible
,
this
clear
expression
of
a
guilty
meaning
with
reference
to
the
wife
of
another
man
!
<EOS>
Burgo
regard
neither
his
plate
nor
his
cup
,
but
thrust
his
hand
into
his
breech
pocket
,
sit
back
in
his
chair
with
the
blackness
as
of
a
thunder
cloud
upon
his
brow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Burgo
,
you
have
well
eat
your
breakfast
,
"
say
Sir
Cosmo
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
any
breakfast
.
"
<EOS>
He
take
,
however
,
a
bit
of
toast
,
and
crumble
it
up
in
his
hand
as
he
put
a
morsel
into
his
mouth
,
go
away
to
the
sideboard
and
fill
for
himself
a
glass
of
cherry
brandy
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
do
not
eat
any
breakfast
the
less
of
that
you
take
the
well
,
"
say
Sir
Cosmo
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
all
right
now
,
"
say
he
,
and
come
back
to
the
table
,
go
through
some
form
of
make
a
meal
with
a
roll
and
a
cup
of
tea
.
  
<EOS>
They
who
be
then
present
use
afterwards
to
say
that
they
should
never
forget
that
breakfast
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
something
,
they
declare
,
in
the
tone
of
Burgo
's
voice
when
he
utter
his
curse
against
Mr.
Palliser
,
which
have
strike
them
all
with
dread
.
<EOS>
there
have
,
too
,
they
say
,
be
a
blackness
in
his
face
,
so
terrible
to
be
see
,
that
it
have
take
from
them
all
the
power
of
conversation
.
<EOS>
Sir
Cosmo
,
when
he
have
break
the
ominous
silence
,
have
do
so
with
a
manifest
struggle
.
<EOS>
the
loud
clatter
of
glass
with
which
Burgo
have
swallow
his
dram
,
as
though
resolve
to
show
that
he
be
regardless
who
may
know
that
he
be
drink
,
add
to
the
feeling
.
<EOS>
It
may
easily
be
understand
that
there
be
no
further
word
speak
at
that
breakfast
-
table
about
Planty
Pall
or
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
on
that
day
Burgo
Fitzgerald
startle
all
those
who
see
him
by
the
mad
way
in
which
he
ride
.
<EOS>
early
in
the
day
there
be
no
excuse
for
any
such
rashness
.
<EOS>
the
hound
go
from
wood
to
wood
,
and
man
go
in
troop
along
the
forest
side
as
they
do
on
such
occasion
.
<EOS>
but
Burgo
be
see
to
cram
his
horse
at
impracticable
place
,
and
to
ride
at
gate
and
rail
as
though
resolve
to
do
himself
and
his
uncle
's
<EOS>
stee
a
mischief
.
<EOS>
this
be
so
apparent
that
some
friend
speak
to
Sir
Cosmo
Monk
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
do
nothing
,
"
say
Sir
Cosmo
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
man
whom
no
one
's
word
will
control
.
<EOS>
something
have
ruffle
him
this
morning
,
and
he
must
run
his
chance
till
he
become
quiet
.
<EOS>
"
in
the
afternoon
there
be
a
good
run
,
and
Burgo
again
ride
as
hard
as
he
could
make
his
horse
carry
him
;
 
but
then
there
be
the
usual
excuse
for
hard
riding
;
and
such
riding
in
a
straight
run
be
not
dangerous
,
as
it
be
when
the
circumstance
of
the
occasion
do
not
warrant
it
,
but
<EOS>
,
be
that
as
it
may
,
Burgo
go
on
to
the
end
of
the
day
without
accident
,
and
as
he
go
home
,
assure
Sir
Cosmo
,
in
a
voice
which
be
almost
cheery
,
that
his
mare
Spinster
be
by
far
the
good
thing
in
the
Monkshade
stable
.
<EOS>
indeed
Spinster
make
quite
a
character
that
day
,
and
be
sell
at
the
end
of
the
season
for
three
hundred
guinea
on
the
strength
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
,
however
,
incline
to
believe
that
there
be
nothing
particular
about
the
mare
.
<EOS>
horse
always
catch
the
temperament
of
their
rider
,
and
when
a
man
wish
to
break
his
neck
,
he
will
generally
find
a
horse
willing
to
assist
him
in
appearance
,
but
able
to
save
him
in
the
performance
.
<EOS>
Burgo
,
at
any
rate
,
do
not
break
his
neck
,
and
appear
at
the
dinner
-
table
in
a
well
humour
than
that
which
he
have
display
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
day
appoint
Mr.
Palliser
reach
Monkshade
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
in
a
manner
,
canvass
for
the
support
of
the
Liberal
party
,
and
it
would
not
have
suit
him
to
show
any
indifference
to
the
invitation
of
so
influential
a
man
as
Sir
Cosmo
.
<EOS>
Sir
Cosmo
have
a
little
party
of
his
own
in
the
House
,
consist
of
four
or
five
other
respectable
country
gentleman
,
who
trouble
themselves
little
with
thinking
,
and
who
mostly
have
bald
head
.
<EOS>
Sir
Cosmo
be
a
man
with
whom
it
be
quite
necessary
that
such
an
aspirant
as
Mr.
Palliser
should
stand
well
,
and
therefore
Mr.
Palliser
come
to
Monkshade
,
although
Lady
Glencora
be
unable
to
accompany
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
so
sorry
,
"
say
Lady
Monk
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
be
look
forward
to
have
Lady
Glencora
with
us
beyond
everything
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
declare
that
Lady
Glencora
herself
be
overwhelmed
with
grief
in
that
she
should
have
be
debar
from
make
this
special
visit
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
however
,
be
so
unwell
at
Gatherum
,
the
anxious
husband
declare
,
as
to
make
it
unsafe
for
her
to
go
again
away
from
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
be
nothing
serious
,
"
say
Lady
Monk
,
with
a
look
of
grief
<EOS>
so
well
arrange
that
any
stranger
would
have
think
that
all
the
Pallisers
must
have
be
very
dear
to
her
heart
.
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Palliser
go
on
to
explain
that
Lady
Glencora
have
unfortunately
be
foolish
.
<EOS>
during
one
of
those
night
of
hard
frost
she
have
go
out
among
the
ruin
at
Matching
,
to
show
them
by
moonlight
to
a
friend
.
<EOS>
the
friend
have
thoughtlessly
,
foolishly
,
and
in
a
manner
which
Mr.
Palliser
declare
to
be
very
reprehensible
,
allow
Lady
Glencora
to
remain
among
the
ruin
till
she
have
catch
cold
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
very
wrong
!
"
say
Lady
Monk
with
considerable
emphasis
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
wrong
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
,
speak
of
poor
Alice
almost
maliciously
.
"
<EOS>
however
,
she
catch
a
cold
which
,
unfortunately
,
have
become
bad
at
my
uncle
's
,
and
so
I
be
oblige
to
take
her
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
perceive
that
Mr.
Palliser
have
in
truth
leave
his
wife
behind
because
he
believe
her
to
be
ill
,
and
not
because
he
be
afraid
of
Burgo
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
so
accomplish
a
woman
as
Lady
Monk
feel
no
doubt
that
the
wife
's
absence
be
cause
by
fear
of
the
lover
,
and
not
by
any
cold
catch
in
view
ruin
by
moonlight
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
to
be
deceive
in
such
a
matter
.
<EOS>
but
she
become
aware
that
Mr.
Palliser
have
be
deceive
.
<EOS>
as
she
be
right
in
this
we
must
go
back
for
a
moment
,
and
say
a
word
of
thing
as
they
go
on
at
match
after
Alice
Vavasor
have
leave
that
place
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
have
tell
Miss
Palliser
that
step
ought
to
be
take
,
whatever
may
be
their
cost
,
to
save
Lady
Glencora
from
the
peril
of
a
visit
to
Monkshade
.
<EOS>
to
this
Miss
Palliser
have
assent
,
and
,
when
she
leave
Alice
,
be
determined
to
tell
Mr.
Palliser
the
whole
story
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
time
for
do
so
have
come
,
her
courage
fail
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
find
word
in
which
to
warn
the
husband
that
his
wife
would
not
be
safe
in
the
company
of
her
old
lover
.
<EOS>
the
task
with
Lady
Glencora
herself
,
bad
as
that
would
be
,
may
be
easy
,
and
this
task
<EOS>
she
at
last
undertook
,
 
not
without
success
.
  
<EOS>
"
Glencora
,
"
she
say
,
when
she
find
a
fitting
opportunity
,
"
you
will
not
be
angry
,
I
hope
,
if
I
say
a
word
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
depend
very
much
upon
what
the
word
be
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
and
here
it
must
be
acknowledge
that
Mr.
Palliser
's
wife
have
not
do
much
to
ingratiate
herself
with
Mr.
Palliser
's
cousin
;
 
not
perhaps
so
much
as
she
should
have
do
,
see
that
she
find
them
in
her
husband
's
house
.
<EOS>
She
have
teach
herself
to
think
that
they
be
hard
,
stiff
,
and
too
proud
of
bear
the
name
of
Palliser
.
<EOS>
perhaps
some
little
attempt
may
have
be
make
by
one
or
both
of
them
to
teach
her
something
,
and
it
nee
hardly
be
say
that
such
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
a
husband
's
unmarried
female
relation
would
not
be
forgive
by
a
young
bride
.
<EOS>
She
have
undoubtedly
be
ungracious
,
and
of
this
Miss
Palliser
be
well
aware
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
 
the
word
shall
be
as
little
unpleasant
as
I
can
make
it
,
"
say
Miss
Palliser
,
already
appreciate
fully
the
difficulty
of
her
task

anything

unpleasant

let
us
have
it
over
at
once

You

Dear
Glencora

I

<EOS>
"
who

Lady

upon

very
sharply

"
nobody

not
in

sense
you

Plantagenet

not
a

Miss
Palliser

<EOS>
"
You
may
be
sure
that
he
would
not
utter
a
word
on
such
a
subject
to
anyone
unless
it
be
to
yourself

<EOS>
but
,
dear
Glencora
,
you
should
not
go
there
;
 
<EOS>
I
mean
it
in
all
kindness
and
love
,
 
I
do
indeed

say
this
she
offer
her
hand
to
Glencora

and
Glencora
take
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
do
,

say
she
in
a
low
voice

<EOS>
"
indeed
I
do

<EOS>
the

so
hard

cruel

I

he
may
care

"
  
<EOS>

It
be
not

I
do
not

Lady
Monk
be
my

once

I

I

It

he
will
not

you

<EOS>
"
I
have

so

You
will
hardly
believe
me

I
condescend
even
to
tell
him
why
I
think
it
better
to
remain
away

<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
in
answer
,
that
it
be
a
silly
folly
which
I
must
live
down

that

<EOS>
"
of
course
you
be
not
afraid

"
  
"
I
be
afraid

<EOS>
that
be
just
the
truth

I
be
afraid

what
can
I
do
more
than
I
have
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
very
terrible
to
Miss
Palliser
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
think
that
Lady
Glencora
would
say
so
much
,
and
she
feel
a
true
regret
in
have
be
make
to
hear
word
which
so
nearly
amount
to
a
confession
.
<EOS>
but
for
this
there
be
no
help
now
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
many
more
word
between
them
,
and
we
already
know
the
result
of
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
become
so
ill
from
the
effect
of
her
imprudent
linger
among
the
ruin
that
she
be
unable
to
go
to
Monkshade
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
remain
three
day
at
Monkshade
,
and
cement
his
political
alliance
with
Sir
Cosmo
much
in
the
same
way
as
he
have
before
do
with
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
.
<EOS>
there
be
little
or
nothing
say
about
politic
,
and
certainly
not
a
word
that
could
be
take
as
any
definite
party
understanding
between
the
man
;
but
they
sit
at
dinner
together
at
the
same
table
,
drink
a
glass
of
wine
or
two
out
of
the
same
decanter
,
and
drop
a
chance
word
now
and
again
about
the
next
session
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
anything
more
have
be
expect
either
by
Mr.
Palliser
or
by
Sir
Cosmo
;
but
it
seem
to
be
understand
when
Mr.
Palliser
go
away
that
Sir
Cosmo
be
of
opinion
that
that
young
scion
of
a
ducal
house
ought
to
become
the
future
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
in
the
Whig
Government
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
see
that
there
be
so
much
in
him
,
"
say
one
young
member
of
Parliament
to
Sir
Cosmo
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
rather
think
that
there
be
,
all
the
same
,
"
say
the
baronet
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
good
deal
in
him
,
I
believe
!
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
be
not
very
bright
,
but
I
do
not
know
that
we
want
brightness
.
<EOS>
a
bright
financier
be
the
most
dangerous
man
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
We
have
have
enough
of
that
already
.
<EOS>
give
me
sound
common
sense
,
with
just
enough
of
the
gab
in
a
man
to
enable
him
to
say
what
he
be
get
to
say
!
<EOS>
We
do
not
want
more
than
that
nowadays
.
"
<EOS>
from
which
it
become
evident
that
Sir
Cosmo
be
satisfied
with
the
new
political
candidate
for
high
place
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
take
an
occasion
to
introduce
Mr.
Palliser
to
Burgo
Fitzgerald
;
with
what
object
it
be
difficult
to
say
,
unless
she
be
anxious
to
make
mischief
between
the
man
.
<EOS>
Burgo
scowl
at
him
;
but
Mr.
Palliser
do
not
notice
the
scowl
,
and
put
out
his
hand
to
his
late
rival
most
affably
.
<EOS>
Burgo
be
force
to
take
it
,
and
as
he
do
so
make
a
little
speech
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
that
we
have
not
the
pleasure
of
see
Lady
Glencora
with
you
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
unfortunately
indispose
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
for
it
,
"
say
Burgo
 
"
very
sorry
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
then
he
turn
his
back
and
walk
away
.
<EOS>
the
few
word
he
have
speak
,
and
the
manner
in
which
he
have
carry
himself
,
have
be
such
as
to
make
all
those
around
them
notice
it
.
<EOS>
each
of
them
know
that
Lady
Glencora
's
name
should
not
have
be
in
Burgo
's
mouth
,
and
all
feel
a
fear
not
easily
to
be
define
that
something
terrible
would
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Palliser
himself
do
not
seem
to
notice
anything
,
or
to
fear
anything
;
and
nothing
terrible
do
come
of
it
during
that
visit
of
his
to
Monkshade
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
speak
to
His
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
Vavasor
return
to
London
with
her
father
,
leave
Kate
at
Vavasor
Hall
with
her
grandfather
.
<EOS>
the
journey
be
not
a
pleasant
one
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
know
that
it
be
his
duty
to
do
something
,
 
to
take
some
step
with
the
view
of
prevent
the
marriage
which
his
daughter
meditate
;
but
he
do
not
know
what
that
something
should
be
,
and
he
do
know
that
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
the
doing
of
it
would
be
thoroughly
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
when
they
start
from
Vavasor
he
have
as
yet
hardly
speak
to
her
a
word
upon
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
congratulate
you
,
"
he
have
simply
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
the
time
may
come
,
papa
,
when
you
will
,
"
Alice
have
answer
;
and
that
have
be
all
.
  
<EOS>
the
squire
have
promise
that
he
would
consent
to
a
reconciliation
with
his
grandson
,
if
Alice
's
father
would
express
himself
satisfied
with
the
propose
marriage
.
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
have
certainly
express
nothing
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
badly
of
him
,
"
he
have
say
,
speak
to
the
old
man
of
George
,
"
that
I
would
rather
know
that
almost
any
other
calamity
be
to
befall
her
,
than
that
she
should
be
unite
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
then
the
squire
,
with
his
usual
obstinacy
,
have
take
up
the
cudgel
on
behalf
of
his
grandson
;
and
have
try
to
prove
that
the
match
after
all
would
not
be
so
bad
in
its
result
as
his
son
seem
to
expect
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
do
very
well
for
the
property
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
settle
the
estate
on
their
eld
son
,
so
that
he
could
not
touch
it
;
and
I
do
not
see
why
he
should
not
reform
as
well
as
another
.
"
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
have
then
declare
that
George
be
thoroughly
bad
,
that
he
be
an
adventurer
;
that
he
believe
him
to
be
a
ruin
man
,
and
that
he
would
never
reform
.
<EOS>
the
squire
upon
this
have
wax
angry
,
and
in
this
way
George
obtain
aid
and
assistance
down
at
the
old
house
,
which
he
certainly
have
no
right
to
expect
.
<EOS>
when
Alice
wish
her
grandfather
good
-
bye
the
old
man
give
her
a
message
to
his
grandson
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
tell
him
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
I
will
never
see
him
again
unless
he
beg
my
pardon
for
his
personal
bad
conduct
to
me
,
but
that
if
he
marry
you
,
I
will
take
care
that
the
property
be
properly
settle
upon
his
child
and
yours
.
<EOS>
I
shall
always
be
glad
to
see
you
,
my
dear
;
and
for
your
sake
,
I
will
see
him
if
he
will
humble
himself
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
word
speak
then
about
her
father
's
consent
;
and
Alice
,
when
she
leave
Vavasor
,
feel
that
the
squire
be
rather
her
friend
than
her
enemy
in
regard
to
this
thing
which
she
contemplate
.
<EOS>
that
her
father
be
and
would
be
an
uncompromising
enemy
to
her
,
 
uncompromise
though
probably
not
energetical
,
 
<EOS>
she
be
well
aware
;
and
,
therefore
,
the
journey
up
to
London
be
not
comfortable
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
have
resolve
,
with
great
pain
to
herself
,
that
in
this
matter
she
owe
her
father
no
obedience
.
<EOS>
"
there
can
not
be
obedience
on
one
side
,
"
she
say
to
herself
,
"
without
protection
and
support
on
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
now
it
be
quite
true
that
John
Vavasor
have
do
little
in
the
way
of
support
or
protect
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
early
in
life
,
before
she
have
reside
under
the
same
roof
with
him
in
London
,
he
have
,
as
it
be
,
wash
his
hand
of
all
solicitude
regard
her
;
and
have
no
other
tie
of
family
,
have
fall
into
habit
of
life
which
make
it
almost
impossible
for
him
to
live
with
her
as
any
other
father
would
live
with
his
child
.
<EOS>
then
,
when
there
first
spring
up
between
them
that
manner
of
share
the
same
house
without
any
join
together
of
their
habit
of
life
,
he
have
excuse
himself
to
himself
by
say
that
Alice
be
unlike
other
girl
,
and
that
she
require
no
protection
.
<EOS>
Her
fortune
be
her
own
,
and
at
her
own
disposal
.
<EOS>
Her
character
be
such
that
she
show
no
inclination
to
throw
the
burden
of
such
disposal
on
her
father
's
shoulder
.
<EOS>
She
be
steady
,
too
,
and
give
to
no
pursuit
which
make
it
necessary
that
he
should
watch
closely
over
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
girl
,
he
think
,
who
could
do
as
well
without
surveillance
as
with
it
,
 
as
well
,
or
perhaps
well
.
<EOS>
so
it
have
come
to
pass
that
Alice
have
be
the
free
mistress
of
her
own
action
,
and
have
be
leave
to
make
the
most
she
could
of
her
own
hour
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
suppose
that
she
have
eat
her
lonely
dinner
in
Queen
Anne
Street
night
after
night
,
week
after
week
,
month
after
month
,
without
tell
herself
that
her
father
be
neglect
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
perceive
that
he
spend
every
evening
in
society
,
but
never
an
evening
in
her
society
,
without
feel
that
the
tie
between
her
<EOS>
and
him
be
not
the
strong
bond
which
usually
bind
a
father
to
his
child
.
<EOS>
She
be
well
aware
that
she
have
be
ill
-
use
in
be
thus
leave
desolate
in
her
home
.
<EOS>
She
have
utter
no
word
of
complaint
;
but
she
have
learn
,
without
be
aware
that
she
be
do
so
,
to
entertain
a
firm
resolve
that
her
father
should
not
guide
her
in
her
path
through
life
.
<EOS>
in
that
affair
of
John
Grey
they
have
both
for
a
time
think
alike
,
and
Mr.
Vavasor
have
believe
that
his
theory
with
reference
to
Alice
have
be
quite
correct
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
leave
to
herself
,
and
be
go
to
dispose
of
herself
in
a
way
than
which
nothing
could
be
more
eligible
.
<EOS>
but
evil
day
be
now
come
,
and
Mr.
Vavasor
,
as
he
travel
up
to
London
,
with
his
daughter
seat
opposite
to
him
in
the
railway
carriage
,
feel
that
now
,
at
last
,
he
must
interfere
.
<EOS>
in
part
of
the
journey
they
have
the
carriage
to
themselves
,
and
Mr.
Vavasor
think
that
he
would
begin
what
he
have
to
say
;
but
he
put
it
off
till
other
join
them
,
and
then
there
be
no
further
opportunity
for
such
conversation
as
that
which
would
be
necessary
between
them
.
<EOS>
They
reach
home
about
eight
in
the
evening
,
have
dine
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
"
She
will
be
tired
to
-
night
,
"
he
say
to
himself
,
as
he
go
off
to
his
club
,
"
and
I
will
speak
to
her
to
-
morrow
.
"
<EOS>
Alice
specially
feel
his
go
on
this
evening
.
<EOS>
when
two
person
have
together
the
tedium
of
such
a
journey
as
that
from
westmoreland
up
to
London
,
there
should
be
some
feeling
between
them
to
bind
them
together
while
enjoy
the
comfort
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
have
he
stay
and
sit
with
her
at
her
tea
-
table
,
Alice
would
at
any
rate
have
endeavour
to
be
soft
with
him
in
any
discussion
that
may
have
be
raise
;
but
he
go
away
from
her
at
once
,
leave
her
to
think
alone
over
the
peril
of
the
life
before
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
after
breakfast
to
-
morrow
,
"
he
say
as
he
go
out
.
<EOS>
Alice
answer
that
she
should
be
there
,
 
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
She
scorn
to
tell
him
that
she
be
always
there
,
 
always
alone
at
home
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
utter
a
word
of
complaint
,
and
she
would
not
begin
now
.
  
<EOS>
the
discussion
after
breakfast
the
next
day
be
commence
with
formal
and
almost
ceremonial
preparation
.
<EOS>
the
father
and
daughter
breakfast
together
,
with
the
knowledge
that
the
discussion
be

It
do
not
give
to
either
of
them
a
good
appetite

very
little

at
table

<EOS>
"
Will
you
come
up
-
stair
?
"
<EOS>
say
Alice
,
when
she
perceive
that
her
father
have
finish
his
tea
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
that
will
be
good
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
then
he
follow
her
into
the
drawing
-
room
in
which
the
fire
have
just
be
light
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
must
speak
to
you
about
this
engagement
of
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
will
not
you
sit
down
,
papa
?
<EOS>
It
do
look
so
dreadful
,
your
standing
up
over
one
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
He
have
place
himself
on
the
rug
with
his
back
to
the
incipient
fire
,
but
now
,
at
her
request
,
he
sit
himself
down
opposite
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
greatly
grieve
when
I
hear
of
this
at
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
that
you
should
be
grieve
,
papa

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
grieve
.
<EOS>
I
must
confess
that
I
never
could
understand
why
you
treat
Mr.
Grey
as
you
have
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
papa
,
that
be
do
and
past
.

pray
let
that
be
among
the
bygone
.

"
  
"
do
he
know
yet
of
your
engagement
with
your
cousin

<EOS>
"
He
will
know
it
by
this
time
to
-
morrow
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
beg
of
you
,
as
a
great
favour
,
to
postpone
your
letter
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
to
this
Alice
make
no
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
trouble
you
with
many
such
request
,
Alice

<EOS>
Will
you
tell
me
that
this
one
shall
be
grant
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
I
owe
it
to
him
as
an
imperative
duty
to
let
him
know
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
may
change
your
mind
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
find
that
this
be
hard
to
bear
and
hard
to
answer
;
but
there
be
a
certain
amount
of
truth
in
the
grievous
reproach
convey
in
her
father
's
word
,
which
make
her
bow
her
neck
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
right
to
say
that
it
be
impossible
,
"
she
reply
,
in
word
that
be
barely
audible
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
exactly
so
,
"
say
her
father
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
therefore
it
will
be
well
that
you
should
postpone
any
such
communication
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
for
how
long
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
till
you
and
I
shall
have
agree
together
that
he
should
be
tell
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
papa
;
I
will
not
consent
to
that
.
<EOS>
I
consider
myself
bind
to
let
him
know
the
truth
without
delay
.
<EOS>
I
have
do
him
a
great
injury
,
and
I
must
put
an
end
to
that
as
soon
as
possible

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
do
him
an
injury
certainly
,
my

a
very
great
injury
,
"
say
Mr.
Vavasor
,
go
away
from
his
object
about
the
propose
letter

and
I
believe
he
will
feel
it
as
such
to
the
last
day

this
go
on
.

<EOS>

sure

"

of
course
what
I
be
think
of
now
be
your
welfare

not
his

when
you
simply
tell
me
that
you

<EOS>
"
alice
winced
,
for
she
fear
to
hear
from
her
father
that
odious
word
which
her
grandfather
have
use
to
her
;
and
indeed
the
word
have
be
on
her
father
's
lip
,
but
he
have
refrain
and
spare
her
 
"
that
you
intend

break
your
engagement

Mr.
Grey

"
he
continue
,
"
I
say
little
or
nothing
to
you

<EOS>
I
would
not
ask
you
to
marry
any
man

even
though
you
have
yourself
promise
to
marry
him

<EOS>
but
when
you
tell
me
that
you

engage
to
your
cousin
George

the
matter
be
very
different
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
well
of
your
cousin

<EOS>
indeed
I
think
anything

well
of
him

<EOS>
It
be
my
duty
to
tell
you
that
the
world
speak
very
ill
of
him

<EOS>
He
pause
,
but
Alice
remain
silent
.
<EOS>
"
when
you
be
about
to
travel
with
him
,
"
he
continue
,
"
I
ought
perhaps
to
have
tell
you
the
same
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
wish
to
pain
you

his
sister
;
and
,
moreover
,
I
have
hear
bad
of
him
since
then
,
 
much
bad
than
I
have
hear
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
you
do
not
tell
me
before

I
think
you
may
spare
me
now

say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
my
dear
;
I
can
not
allow
you
to
sacrifice
yourself
without
tell
you
that
you

so

if
it
be

of
that
I

He
have
tell
me
so
himself
very
plainly

<EOS>
"
and
yet
you
will
marry
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
I
will
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
,
papa
,
that
there
be
a
great
deal
of
false
feeling
about
this
matter
of
money
in
marriage
,
 
or
rather
,
perhaps
,
a
great
deal
of
pretended
feeling
.
<EOS>
why
should
I
be
angry
with
a
man
for
wish
to
get
that
for
which
every
man
be
struggle
?
<EOS>
at
this
point
of
George
's
career
the
use
of
money
be
essential
to
him

<EOS>
He
could
not
marry
without
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
well
then
give
him
your
money
without
yourself

her
father

in
irony

Mr.
Vavasor

jump
up
from

You
mean

give
him
your
money

him

<EOS>
"
certainly
I
do
;

heaven

exclaim
Mr.

to
part
with
my
money
to
my
friend

she

<EOS>
"
It
be

kind
of
madness

not
a

Papa
,
pray
do
not

at
me
like
that
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
no
thought
of
marry
him
you
would
not
call
me
mad

I
lend
to
my
cousin
what
money
he
may
need
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
only
say
that
so
much
of
your
fortune

throw
away

it
be
not
much
that
would
be
an
end
of
it

I
would
sooner
see
you
surrender
to
him
the
half
of
all
you
have

without
any
engagement

marry
him

know

receive
a

you

prejudice

have
you
not

unworthy

you

<EOS>
"
We
be
both
young
,
then
,
"
say
Alice
,
speak
very
softly
,
but
very
seriously
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
both
much
young
then
,
and
look
at
life
with
other
eye
than
those
which
we
now
use
.
<EOS>
for
myself
I
expect
much
then
,
which
I
now
seem
hardly
to
regard
at
all
;
and
as
for
him
,
he
be
then
attach
to
pleasure
to
which
I
believe
he
have
now
learn
to
be
indifferent

<EOS>

Psha
!

the
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
speak
as
I
believe

continue
Alice

<EOS>
and
I
think
I
may
perhaps
know
more
of
his
manner
of
life
than
you
do
,
papa

<EOS>
but
I
be
prepared
to
run
risk
now
which
I
fear
before
.
<EOS>
even
though
he
be
all
that
you
think
him
to
be
,
I
would
still
endeavour
to
do
my
duty
to
him
,

to
bring
him
to
other
thing

<EOS>
"
what
be
it
you
expect
to
get
by

him

"
ask
Mr.

<EOS>
"
a
husband
whose
mode
of
thinking
be
congenial
to
my

answer
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
husband
who
propose
to
himself
a
career
in
life
with
which
I
can
sympathize
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
I
may
perhaps
help
my
cousin
in
the
career
which
he
have
choose
,
and
that
alone
be
a
great
reason
why
I
should
attempt
to
do
so
.

"
<EOS>
with
your
money
?
"
say
Mr.
Vavasor
with
a
sneer

<EOS>
"
partly
with
my
money
,
"
say
Alice
,
disdain
to
answer
the
sneer
.
<EOS>
"
though
it
be
only
with
my
money

even
that
would
be
something

"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Alice
,
as
your
father
,
I
can
only
implore
you
to
pause
before
you
commit
yourself
to
his
hand

<EOS>
if
he
demand
money
from
you
,
and
you
be
minded
to
give
it
to
him

let
him
have
it
in
moderation

<EOS>
anything
will
be
well
than
marry
him
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
can
not
hinder
you
;
you
be
as
much
your
own
mistress
as
I
be
my
own
master
,
 
or
rather
a
great
deal
more
,
as
my
income
depend
on
my
go
to
that
horrid
place
in
Chancery
Lane
.
<EOS>

yet
I
suppose
you
must
think
something
of
your
father
's
wish
and
your
father
's
opinion

<EOS>
It
will
not
be
pleasant
for
you
to
stand
at
the
altar
without
my
be
there
near
you

<EOS>
to
this
Alice
make
no
answer
;
but
she
tell
herself
that
it
have
not
be
pleasant
to
her
to
have
stand
at
so
many
place
during
the
last
four
year
,
 
and
to
have
find
herself
so
often
alone
,
 
without
her
father
be
near
to
her
.
<EOS>
that
have
be
his
fault
,
and
it
be
not
now
in
her
power
to
remedy
the
ill
-
effect
of
it

have
any
day
be
fix
between
you

ask

no

<EOS>

nothing
have
be

<EOS>
"
yes
;
something
have
be
say

I
have
tell
him
that
it
can
not
be
for
a
year
yet

<EOS>
It
be
because
I
tell
him
that
,
that
I
tell
him
also
that
he
should
have
my
money
when
he
want
it

not
all

it

Mr.

I
do
not
suppose
he
will
need
it
all

He
intend
to
stand
again
for
Chelsea

it
be
the
great
expense
of
the
election
which
make
him
want
money

You
be
not

suppose

have
ask

I
make
him
understand
that
I

quite
yet

offer
him
the
use

that
which
would

his
own
.

he
have
accept
it

He
answer
me
just

I
have
intend

when
the
need
come
he
would
take
me
at
my
word

then
,
Alice

I
will
tell
you

be
my

will
drain
you
of
every
shilling
of
your
money
,

when
that
be
go
,
there
will
be
no
more
hear
of
the
marriage

<EOS>
We
must
take
a
small
house
in
some
cheap
part
of
the
town
and
live
on
my
income
as
best
we
may
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
and
insure
my
life
,
so
that
you
may
not
absolutely
starve
when
I
die
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
say
this
,
Mr.
Vavasor
go
away
,
not
immediately
to
the
insurance
office
,
as
his
word
seem
to
imply
,
but
to
his
club
where
he
sit
alone
,
read
the
newspaper
,
very
gloomily
,
till
the
time
come
for
his
afternoon
rubber
of
whist
,
and
the
club
dinner
bill
for
the
day
be
bring
under
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
have
no
such
consolation
in
her
solitude
.
<EOS>
She
have
fight
her
battle
with
her
father
tolerably
well
,
but
she
be
now
call
upon
to
fight
a
battle
with
herself
,
which
be
one
much
more
difficult
to
win
.
<EOS>
be
her
cousin
,
her
betroth
as
she
now
must
regard
him
,
the
worthless
,
heartless
,
mercenary
rascal
which
her
father
paint
him
?
<EOS>
there
have
certainly
be
a
time
,
and
that
not
very
long
distant
,
in
which
Alice
herself
have
be
almost
constrain
so
to
regard
him
.
<EOS>
since
that
any
change
for
the
well
in
her
opinion
of
him
have
be
ground
on
evidence
give
either
by
himself
or
by
his
sister
Kate
.
<EOS>
He
have
do
nothing
to
inspire
her
with
any
confidence
,
unless
his
reckless
daring
in
come
forward
to
contest
a
seat
in
Parliament
could
be
regard
as
a
doing
of
something
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
own
himself
to
be
a
man
almost
penniless
;
he
have
speak
of
himself
as
be
utterly
reckless
,
 
as
be
one
whose
standing
in
the
world
be
and
must
continue
to
be
a
perch
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
,
from
which
any
accident
may
knock
him
headlong
.
<EOS>
Alice
believe
in
her
heart
that
this
last
profession
or
trade
to
which
he
have
apply
himself
,
be
become
as
nothing
to
him
,
 
that
he
receive
from
it
no
certain
income
;
 
no
income
that
a
man
could
make
to
appear
respectable
to
father
or
guardian
when
seek
a
girl
in
marriage
.
<EOS>
Her
father
declare
that
all
man
speak
badly
of
him
.
<EOS>
Alice
know
her
father
to
be
an
idle
man
,
a
man
give
to
pleasure
,
to
be
one
who
think
by
far
too
much
of
the
good
thing
of
the
world
;
but
she
have
never
find
him
to
be
either
false
or
malicious
.
<EOS>
His
unwonted
energy
in
this
matter
be
in
itself
evidence
that
he
believe
himself
to
be
right
in
what
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
to
tell
the
truth
,
Alice
be
frightened
at
what
she
have
do
,
and
almost
repent
of
it
already
.
<EOS>
Her
acceptance
of
her
cousin
's
offer
have
not
come
of
love
;
 
nor
have
it
,
in
truth
,
come
chiefly
of
ambition
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
so
much
ask
herself
why
she
should
do
this
thing
,
as
why
she
should
not
do
it
,
 
see
that
it
be
require
of
her
by
her
friend
.
<EOS>
what
after
all
do
it
matter
?
<EOS>
that
be
her
argument
with
herself
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
suppose
that
she
look
back
on
the
past
event
of
her
life
with
any
self
-
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
self
-
satisfaction
,
but
in
truth
there
be
more
self
-
reproach
than
she
deserve
.
<EOS>
as
a
girl
she
have
love
her
cousin
George
passionately
,
and
that
love
have
fail
her
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
tell
herself
that
she
have
be
wrong
when
she
give
him
up
,
but
she
think
herself
to
have
be
most
unfortunate
in
the
one
necessity
.
<EOS>
after
such
an
experience
as
that
,
would
it
not
have
be
well
for
her
to
have
remain
without
further
thought
of
marriage
?
  
<EOS>
then
come
that
terrible
episode
in
her
life
for
which
she
never
could
forgive
herself
.
<EOS>
She
have
accept
Mr.
Grey
because
she
like
him
and
honour
him
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
do
love
him
,
"
she
say
to
herself
,
now
on
this
morning
.
<EOS>
poor
,
wretched
,
heart
-
wrung
woman
!
<EOS>
as
she
sit
there
think
of
it
all
in
her
solitude
she
be
to
be
pity
at
any
rate
,
if
not
to
be
forgive
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
she
think
of
Nethercoats
,
with
its
quiet
life
,
its
garden
,
its
book
,
and
the
peaceful
affectionate
ascendancy
of
him
who
would
have
be
her
lord
and
master
,
her
feeling
be
very
different
from
those
which
have
induce
her
to
resolve
that
she
would
not
stoop
to
put
her
neck
beneath
that
yoke
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
have
be
well
for
her
to
have
a
master
who
by
his
wisdom
and
strength
could
save
her
from
such
wretched
doubting
as
these
?
<EOS>
but
she
have
refuse
to
bend
,
and
then
she
have
find
herself
desolate
and
alone
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
can
do
him
good
why
should
I
not
marry
him
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
that
feeling
have
be
the
chief
argument
which
have
induce
her
to
return
such
an
answer
as
she
have
send
to
her
cousin
.
"
<EOS>
for
myself
,
what
do
it
matter
?
<EOS>
as
to
this
life
of
mine
and
all
that
belong
to
it
,
why
should
I
regard
it
otherwise
than
to
make
it
of
some
service
to
some
one
who
be
dear
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
He
have
be
ever
dear
to
her
from
her
early
year
.
<EOS>
She
believe
in
his
intellect
,
even
if
she
could
not
believe
in
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
Kate
,
her
friend
,
long
for
this
thing
.
<EOS>
as
for
that
dream
of
love
,
it
mean
nothing
;
and
as
for
those
argument
of
prudence
,
 
that
cold
calculation
about
her
money
,
which
all
people
seem
to
expect
from
her
,
 
she
would
throw
it
to
the
wind
.
<EOS>
what
if
she
be
ruin
!
<EOS>
there
be
always
the
other
chance
.
<EOS>
She
may
save
him
from
ruin
,
and
help
him
to
honour
and
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
but
then
,
when
the
word
be
once
past
her
lip
,
there
return
to
her
that
true
woman
's
feeling
which
make
her
plead
for
a
long
day
,
 
which
make
her
feel
that
that
long
day
would
be
all
too
short
,
 
which
make
her
already
dread
the
coming
of
the
end
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
She
have
say
that
she
would
become
George
Vavasor
's
wife
,
but
she
wish
that
the
saying
so
may
be
the
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
when
he
come
to
her
to
embrace
her
how
should
she
receive
him
?
<EOS>
the
memory
of
John
Grey
's
last
kiss
still
linger
on
her
lip
.
<EOS>
She
have
tell
herself
that
she
scorn
the
delight
of
love
;
if
it
be
so
,
be
she
not
bind
to
keep
herself
far
from
them
;
if
it
be
so
,
 
would
not
her
cousin
's
kiss
pollute
her
?
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
as
my
father
say
,
"
she
think
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
that
he
want
my
money
only
;
if
so
,
let
him
have
it
.
<EOS>
surely
when
the
year
be
over
I
shall
know
.
<EOS>
"
then
a
plan
form
itself
in
her
head
,
which
she
do
not
make
willingly
,
with
any
voluntary
action
of
her
mind
,
 
but
which
come
upon
her
as
plan
do
come
,
 
and
recommend
itself
to
her
in
despite
of
herself
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
her
money
as
he
may
call
for
it
,
 
all
of
it
except
some
small
portion
of
her
income
,
which
may
suffice
to
keep
her
from
burden
her
father
.
<EOS>
then
,
if
he
be
content
,
he
should
go
free
,
without
reproach
,
and
there
should
be
an
end
of
all
question
of
marriage
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
as
she
think
of
this
,
and
mature
it
in
her
mind
,
the
door
open
,
and
the
servant
announce
her
cousin
George
.
   
<EOS>
passion
versus
Prudence
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
not
occur
to
Alice
that
her
accepted
lover
would
come
to
her
so
soon
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
tell
him
expressly
of
the
day
on
which
she
would
return
,
and
have
not
reflect
that
Kate
would
certainly
inform
him
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
think
so
much
of
the
distant
peril
of
this
engagement
,
that
this
peril
,
so
sure
to
come
upon
her
before
many
day
or
hour
could
pass
by
,
have
be
forget
.
<EOS>
when
the
name
strike
her
ear
,
and
George
's
step
be
hear
outside
on
the
landing
-
place
,
she
feel
the
blood
rush
violently
to
her
heart
,
and
she
jump
up
from
her
seat
panic
-
stricken
and
in
utter
dismay
.
<EOS>
how
should
she
receive
him
?
<EOS>
and
then
again
,
with
what
form
of
affection
would
she
be
accost
by
him
?
<EOS>
but
he
be
there
in
the
room
with
her
before
she
have
have
a
moment
allow
to
her
for
thought
.
  
<EOS>
She
hardly
venture
to
look
up
at
him
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
she
become
aware
that
there
be
something
in
his
appearance
and
dress
brighter
,
more
lover
-
like
,
perhaps
new
,
than
be
usual
with
him
.
<EOS>
this
in
itself
be
an
affliction
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
have
understand
that
such
an
engagement
as
theirs
not
only
do
not
require
,
but
absolutely
forbid
,
any
such
symptom
of
young
love
as
this
.
<EOS>
even
when
their
marriage
come
,
if
it
must
come
,
it
should
come
without
any
customary
sign
of
smartness
,
without
any
outward
mark
of
exaltation
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
very
good
in
him
to
have
remain
away
from
her
for
week
and
month
;
but
to
come
upon
her
thus
,
on
the
first
morning
of
her
return
,
be
a
cruelty
not
to
be
forgive
.
<EOS>
these
be
the
feeling
with
which
Alice
regard
her
betroth
when
he
come
to
see
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
say
he
,
come
up
to
her
with
his
extended
hand
,
 
"
Dearest
Alice
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
give
him
her
hand
,
and
mutter
some
word
which
be
inaudible
even
to
him
;
she
give
him
her
hand
,
and
immediately
endeavour
to
resume
it
,
but
he
hold
it
clench
within
his
own
,
and
she
feel
that
she
be
his
prisoner
.
<EOS>
He
be
stand
close
to
her
now
,
and
she
could
not
escape
from
him
.
<EOS>
She
be
tremble
with
fear
lest
bad
may
betide
her
even
than
this
.
<EOS>
She
have
promise
to
marry
him
,
and
now
she
be
cover
with
dismay
as
she
feel
rather
than
think
how
very
far
she
be
from
love
the
man
to
whom
she
have
give
this
promise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
be
a
man
once
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
now
that
I
can
tell
you
what
I
have
suffer
during
these
last
few
year
.
"
<EOS>
He
still
hold
her
hand
,
but
he
have
not
as
yet
attempt
any
close
embrace
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
she
be
stand
away
from
him
awkwardly
,
almost
show
her
repugnance
to
him
;
but
it
be
altogether
beyond
her
power
to
assume
an
attitude
of
ordinary
ease
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
he
continue
,
"
I
feel
that
I
be
a
strong
man
again
,
armed
to
meet
the
world
at
all
point
.
<EOS>
Will
you
not
let
me
thank
you
for
what
you
have
do
for
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
must
speak
to
him
!
<EOS>
though
the
doing
so
should
be
ever
so
painful
to
her
,
she
must
say
some
word
to
him
which
should
have
in
it
a
sound
of
kindness
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
it
be
his
undoubted
right
to
come
to
her
,
and
the
footing
on
which
he
assume
to
stand
be
simply
that
which
she
herself
have
give
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
his
fault
if
at
this
moment
he
inspire
her
with
disgust
rather
than
with
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
do
nothing
for
you
,
George
,
"
she
say
,
"
nothing
at
all
.
"
<EOS>
then
she
get
her
hand
away
from
him
,
and
retreat
back
to
a
sofa
where
she
seat
herself
,
leave
him
still
stand
in
the
space
before
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
that
you
may
do
much
for
yourself
be
my
great
hope
.
<EOS>
if
I
can
help
you
,
I
will
do
so
most
heartily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
she
become
thoroughly
ashamed
of
her
word
,
feel
that
she
be
at
once
offer
to
him
the
use
of
her
purse
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
will
help
me
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
full
of
plan
,
all
of
which
you
must
share
with
me
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
at
this
moment
,
my
one
great
plan
be
that
in
which
you
have
already
consent
to
be
my
partner
.
<EOS>
alice
,
you
be
my
wife
now
.
<EOS>
tell
me
that
it
will
make
you
happy
to
call
me
your
husband
.
"
  
<EOS>
not
for
world
could
she
have
say
so
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
It
be
ill
-
judge
in
him
to
press
her
thus
.
<EOS>
He
should
already
have
see
,
with
half
an
eye
,
that
no
such
triumph
as
that
which
he
now
demand
could
be
his
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
have
have
his
triumph
when
,
in
the
solitude
of
his
own
room
,
with
quiet
sarcasm
he
have
throw
on
one
side
of
him
the
letter
in
which
she
have
accept
him
,
as
though
the
matter
have
be
one
almost
indifferent
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
right
to
expect
the
double
triumph
.
<EOS>
then
he
have
frankly
tell
himself
that
her
money
would
be
useful
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
be
content
with
that
conviction
,
and
not
have
require
her
also
to
speak
to
him
soft
win
word
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
must
be
still
distant
,
George
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
suffer
so
much
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
it
have
be
my
fault
that
you
have
suffer
;
I
know
that
.
<EOS>
these
year
of
misery
have
be
my
doing
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
,
however
,
the
year
of
come
misery
that
be
the
most
to
be
dread
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
that
,
"
she
reply
,
"
nor
have
I
ever
think
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
myself
and
myself
only
to
blame
.
<EOS>
"
here
he
altogether
misunderstand
her
,
believe
her
to
mean
that
the
fault
for
which
she
blame
herself
have
be
commit
in
separate
herself
from
him
on
that
former
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
dear
,
let
bygone
be
bygone

<EOS>
"
  
"
bygone
will
not
be
bygone

<EOS>
It
may
be
well
for
people
to
say
so
,
but
it
be
never
true

<EOS>
one
may
as
well
say
so
to
one
's
body
as
to
one
's
heart

<EOS>
but
the
hair
will
grow
grey
,
and
the
heart
will
grow
cold

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
that
one
follow
upon
the
other

say
George
.
<EOS>
"
My
hair
be
grow
very
grey

and
to
show
that
it
be
so
,
he
lift
the
dark
lock
from
the
side
of
his
forehead
,
and
display
the
incipient
grizzling
of
the
hair
from
behind

"
if
grey
hair
make
an
old
man

Alice
,
you
will
marry
an
old

you

not

old

<EOS>
that
word

husband
,
"
which
her
cousin
have
twice
use
,
be
painful
to
Alice
's
ear
.
<EOS>
She
shrink
from
it
with
palpable
bodily
suffering
.
<EOS>
marry
an
old
husband
!
<EOS>
His
age
be
nothing
to
the
purpose
,
though
he
have
be
as
old
as
Enoch
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
again
oblige
to
answer
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
speak
of
my
own
heart

say
she
:

I
sometimes
feel

very
old

Alice

hardly

to
me

<EOS>
"
You
have
come
to
me
too
quickly
,
George
,
and
do
not
reflect
how
much
there
be
that
I
must
remember
.
<EOS>
You
have
say
that
bygone
should

them
be
so

far

me
a
few
month
in
which
I
may
learn
,
 
not
to
forget
them
,
for
that
will
be
impossible
,
 
but
to
abstain
from
speak
of
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
her
look
as
she
speak
,
and
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
that
be
very
sad
.
<EOS>
It
strike
him
forcibly
,
but
it
strike
him
with
anger
rather
than
with
sadness
.
<EOS>
doubtless
her
money
have
be
his
chief
object
when
he
offer
to
renew
his
engagement
with
her
.
<EOS>
doubtless
he
would
have
make
no
such
offer
<EOS>
have
she
be
penniless
,
or
even
have
his
own
need
be
less
pressing
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
desire
something
more
than
money
.
<EOS>
the
triumph
of
be
prefer
to
John
Grey
,
 
of
have
John
Grey
send
altogether
adrift
,
in
order
that
his
old
love
may
be
recover
,
would
have
be
too
costly
a
luxury
for
him
to
seek
,
have
he
not
in
seek
it
be
able
to
combine
prudence
with
the
luxury
.
<EOS>
but
though
his
prudence
have
be
undoubted
,
he
desire
the
luxury
also
.
<EOS>
It
be
on
a
calculation
of
the
combine
advantage
that
he
have
make
his
second
offer
to
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
as
he
would
by
no
mean
have
consent
to
proceed
with
the
arrangement
without
the
benefit
of
his
cousin
's
money
,
so
also
do
he
feel
unwilling
to
dispense
with
some
expression
of
her
love
for
him
,
which
would
be
to
him
triumphant
.
<EOS>
hitherto
in
their
present
interview
<EOS>
there
have
certainly
be
no
expression
of
her
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
he
say
,
"
your
greeting
to
me
be
hardly
all
that
I
have
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
not
?
"
say
she
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
George
,
I
be
sorry
that
you
should
be
disappointed
;
but
what
can
I
say
?
<EOS>
You
would
not
have
me
affect
a
lightness
of
spirit
which
I
do
not
feel
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
wish
,
"
say
he
,
very
slowly
,
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
wish
to
retract
your
letter
to
me
,
you
now
have
my
leave
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
what
an
opportunity
be
this
of
escape
!
<EOS>
but
she
have
not
the
courage
to
accept
it
.
<EOS>
what
girl
,
under
such
circumstance
,
would
have
have
such
courage
?
<EOS>
how
often
be
offer
make
to
us
which
we
would
almost
give
our
eye
to
accept
,
but
dare
not
accept
because
we
fear
the
countenance
of
the
offerer
?
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wish
to
retract
my
letter
,
"
say
she
,
speak
as
slowly
as
he
have
speak
;
"
but
I
wish
to
be
leave
awhile
,
that
I
may
recover
my
strength
of
mind
.
<EOS>
have
you
not
hear
doctor
say
,
that
muscle
which
have
be
strain
,
should
be
allow
rest
,
or
they
will
never
entirely
renew
their
tension
?
<EOS>
It
be
so
with
me
now
;
if
I
could
be
quiet
for
a
few
month
,
I
think
I
could
learn
to
face
the
future
with
a
well
courage
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
be
that
all
you
can
say
to
me
,
Alice
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
would
you
have
me
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
would
fain
hear
one
word
of
love
from
you
;
be
that
unreasonable
?
<EOS>
I
would
wish
to
know
from
your
own
lip
that
you
have
satisfaction
in
the
renew
prospect
of
our
union
;
be
that
too
ambitious
?
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
that
I
be
over
-
bold
in
press
my
suit
upon
you
again
;
but
as
you
accept
it
,
have
I
not
a
right
to
expect
that
you
should
show
me
that
you
have
be
happy
in
accept
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
she
have
not
be
happy
in
accept
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
happy
now
that
she
have
accept
it
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
show
to
him
any
sign
of
such
joy
as
that
which
he
desire
to
see
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
at
this
moment
,
she
fear
with
an
excessive
fear
that
there
would
come
some
demand
for
an
outward
demonstration
of
love
,
such
as
he
in
his
position
may
have
a
right
to
make
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
be
aware
that
this
may
be
prevent
only
by
such
demeanour
on
her
part
as
that
which
she
have
practise
,
and
she
could
not
,
therefore
,
be
stir
to
the
expression
of
any
word
of
affection
.
<EOS>
She
listen
to
his
appeal
,
and
when
it
be
finish
she
make
no
reply
.
<EOS>
if
he
choose
to
take
her
in
dudgeon
,
he
must
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
would
make
for
him
any
sacrifice
that
be
possible
to
her
,
but
this
sacrifice
be
not
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
have
not
a
word
to
say
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
<EOS>
She
look
up
at
him
,
and
see
that
the
cicature
on
his
face
be
become
ominous
;
his
eye
be
bent
upon
her
with
all
their
forbid
brilliance
,
and
he
be
assume
that
look
of
angry
audacity
which
be
so
peculiar
to
him
,
and
which
have
so
often
cow
those
with
whom
he
be
bring
in
contact
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
other
word
,
at
present
,
George
;
I
have
tell
you
that
I
be
not
at
ease
.
<EOS>
why
do
you
press
me
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
her
letter
to
him
in
the
breast
-
pocket
of
his
coat
,
and
his
hand
be
on
it
,
that
he
may
fling
it
back
to
her
,
and
tell
her
that
he
would
not
hold
her
to
be
his
promise
wife
under
such
circumstance
as
these
.
<EOS>
the
anger
which
would
have
induce
him
to
do
so
be
the
well
part
of
his
nature
.
<EOS>
three
or
four
year
since
,
this
well
part
would
have
prevail
,
and
he
would
have
give
way
to
his
rage
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
as
his
finger
play
upon
the
paper
,
he
remember
that
her
money
be
absolutely
essential
to
him
,
 
that
some
of
it
be
need
by
him
almost
instantly
,
 
that
on
this
very
morning
he
be
bind
to
go
where
money
would
be
demand
from
him
,
and
that
his
hope
with
regard
to
Chelsea
could
not
be
maintain
unless
he
be
able
to
make
some
substantial
promise
of
provide
fund
.
<EOS>
His
sister
Kate
's
fortune
be
just
two
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
that
,
and
no
more
,
be
now
the
capital
at
his
command
,
if
he
should
abandon
this
other
source
of
aid
.
<EOS>
even
that
must
go
,
if
all
other
source
should
fail
him
;
but
he
would
fain
have
that
untouched
,
if
it
be
possible
.
<EOS>
oh
,
that
that
old
man
in
Westmoreland
would
die
and
be
gather
to
his
father
,
now
that
he
be
full
of
year
and
ripe
for
the
sickle
!
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
sign
of
death
about
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
so
his
finger
release
their
hold
on
the
letter
,
and
he
stand
look
at
her
in
his
anger
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wish
me
then
to
go
from
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
be
angry
with
me
,
George
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
angry
!
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
to
be
angry
.
<EOS>
but
,
by
heaven
,
I
be
wrong
there
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
right
,
and
I
be
angry
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
owe
it
me
to
give
me
some
warm
welcome
.
<EOS>
be
it
to
be
thus
with
us
always
for
the
next
accurse
year
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
oh
,
George
!
"
  
"
to
me
it
will
be
accurse
.
<EOS>
but
be
it
to
be
thus
between
us
always
?
<EOS>
alice
,
I
have
love
you
above
all
woman

<EOS>
I
may
say
that
I
have
never
love
any
woman
but
you
;
and
yet
I
be
sometimes
drive
to
doubt
whether
you
have
a
heart
in
you
capable
of
love
.
<EOS>
after
all
that
have
pass
,
all
your
old
protestation
,
all
my
repentance
,
and
your
proffer
of
forgiveness
,
you
should
have
receive
me
with
open
arm
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
may
go
now
,
and
feel
that
I
have
be
kick
out
of
your
house
like
a
dog
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
speak
to
me
like
that
,
and
look
at
me
like
that
,
how
can
I
answer
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
no
answer
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
put
your
hand
in
mine
,
to
kiss
me
,
and
to
tell
me
that
you
be
once
more
my
own
.
<EOS>
alice
,
think
better
of
it
;
kiss
me
,
and
let
me
feel
my
arm
once
more
round
your
waist
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
shudder
as
she
sit
,
still
silent
,
on
her
seat
,
and
he
see
that
she
shudder
.
<EOS>
with
all
his
desire
for
her
money
,
 
his
instant
need
of
it
,
 
this
be
too
much
for
him
;
and
he
turn
upon
his
heel
,
and
leave
the
room
without
another
word
.
<EOS>
She
hear
his
quick
step
as
he
hurry
down
the
stair
,
but
she
do
not
rise
to
arrest
him
.
<EOS>
She
hear
the
door
slam
as
he
leave
the
house
,
but
still
she
do
not
move
from
her
seat
.
<EOS>
Her
immediate
desire
have
be
that
he
should
go
,
 
and
now
he
be
go
.
<EOS>
there
be
in
that
a
relief
which
almost
comfort
her
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
the
man
from
whom
,
within
the
last
few
day
,
she
have
accept
an
offer
of
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
George
,
when
he
leave
the
house
,
walk
hurriedly
into
Cavendish
Square
,
and
down
along
the
east
side
,
till
he
make
his
way
out
along
Princes
Street
,
into
the
Circus
in
Oxford
Street
.
<EOS>
close
to
him
there
,
in
Great
Marlborough
Street
,
be
the
house
of
his
parliamentary
attorney
,
Mr.
Scruby
,
on
whom
he
be
bind
to
call
on
that
morning
.
<EOS>
as
he
have
walk
away
from
Queen
Anne
Street
,
he
have
think
of
nothing
but
that
too
visible
shudder
which
his
cousin
Alice
have
be
unable
to
repress
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
feed
on
his
anger
,
and
indulge
it
,
tell
himself
at
one
moment
that
he
would
let
her
and
her
money
go
from
him
whither
they
list
,
 
and
make
inward
threat
in
the
next
that
the
time
should
come
in
which
he
would
punish
her
for
this
ill
-
usage
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
the
necessity
of
resolve
what
he
would
say
to
Mr.
Scruby
.
<EOS>
to
Mr.
Scruby
be
still
due
some
trifle
on
the
cost
of
the
last
election
;
but
even
if
this
be
pay
,
Mr.
Scruby
would
make
no
heavy
advance
towards
the
expense
of
the
next
election
.
<EOS>
whoever
may
come
out
at
the
end
of
such
affair
without
a
satisfactory
settlement
of
his
little
bill
,
as
have
for
a
while
be
the
case
with
Mr.
Grimes
,
from
the
"
Handsome
Man
,
"
 
and
as
,
indeed
,
still
be
the
case
with
him
,
as
that
note
of
hand
at
three
month
<EOS>
"
date
be
not
yet
pay
,
 
Mr.
Scruby
seldom
allow
himself
to
suffer
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
the
election
would
not
take
place
till
the
summer
;
but
there
be
preliminary
expense
which
need
ready
money
.
<EOS>
metropolitan
voter
,
as
Mr.
Scruby
often
declare
,
require
to
be
keep
in
good
humour
,
 
so
that
Mr.
Scruby
want
the
present
payment
of
some
five
hundred
pound
,
and
a
well
-
ground
assurance
that
he
would
be
put
in
full
fund
by
the
beginning
of
next
June
.
<EOS>
even
Mr.
Scruby
may
not
be
true
as
perfect
steel
,
if
he
think
that
his
candidate
at
the
last
moment
would
not
come
forth
properly
prepare
.
<EOS>
other
candidate
,
with
money
in
their
pocket
,
may
find
their
way
into
Mr.
Scruby
's
office
.
<EOS>
as
George
Vavasor
cross
Regent
Street
,
he
gulp
down
his
anger
,
and
apply
his
mind
to
business
.
<EOS>
Should
he
prepare
himself
to
give
order
that
Kate
's
little
property
should
be
sell
out
,
or
would
he
resolve
to
use
his
cousin
's
money
?
<EOS>
that
his
cousin
's
money
would
still
be
at
his
disposal
,
in
spite
of
the
stormy
mood
in
which
he
have
retreat
from
her
presence
,
he
feel
sure
;
but
the
asking
for
it
on
his
part
would
be
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
that
duty
he
must
entrust
to
Kate
.
<EOS>
but
as
he
reach
Mr.
Scruby
's
door
,
he
have
decide
that
for
such
purpose
as
those
now
in
hand
,
it
be
preferable
that
he
should
use
his
wife
's
fortune
.
<EOS>
It
be
thus
that
in
his
own
mind
he
word
the
phrase
,
and
make
for
himself
an
excuse
.
<EOS>
yes
;
 
he
would
use
his
wife
's
fortune
,
and
explain
to
Mr.
Scruby
that
he
would
be
justify
in
do
so
by
the
fact
that
his
own
heritage
would
be
settle
on
her
at
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
that
he
altogether
like
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
,
at
any
rate
as
yet
,
an
altogether
heartless
swindler
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
take
his
cousin
's
money
without
mean
,
 
without
think
that
he
mean
,
to
repay
her
in
full
all
that
he
take
.
<EOS>
Her
behaviour
to
him
this
very
morning
have
no
doubt
make
the
affair
more
difficult
to
his
mind
,
and
more
unpleasant
than
it
would
have
be
have
she
smile
on
him
;
but
even
as
it
be
,
he
manage
to
assure
himself
that
he
be
do
her
no
wrong
,
and
with
this
self
-
assurance
he
enter
Mr.
Scruby
's
office
.
  
<EOS>
the
clerk
in
the
outer
office
be
very
civil
to
him
,
and
undertake
to
promise
him
that
he
should
not
be
keep
wait
an
instant
.
<EOS>
there
be
four
gentleman
in
the
little
parlour
,
they
say
,
wait
to
see
Mr.
Scruby
,
but
there
they
should
remain
till
Mr.
Vavasor
's
interview
be
over
.
<EOS>
one
gentleman
,
as
it
seem
,
be
even
turn
out
to
make
way
for
him
;
for
as
George
be
usher
into
the
lawyer
's
room
,
a
little
man
,
look
very
meek
,
be
hurry
away
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
wait
,
Smithers
,
"
say
Mr.
Scruby
,
speak
from
within
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
be
very
long
.
"
Vavasor
apologize
to
his
agent
for
the
injury
he
be
do
Smithers
;
but
Mr.
Scruby
explain
that
he
be
only
a
poor
devil
of
a
printer
,
look
for
payment
of
his
little
account
.
<EOS>
He
have
print
and
post
30,000
placard
for
one
of
the
late
Marylebone
candidate
,
and
find
some
difficulty
in
get
his
money
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
when
they
be
in
a
small
way
of
business
,
it
ruin
them
,
"
say
Scruby
.
<EOS>
"
now
that
poor
devil
,
 
he
have
not
have
a
shilling
of
his
money
yet
,
and
the
great
part
have
be
pay
out
of
his
pocket
to
the
poster
.
<EOS>
It
be
hard
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
comfort
Vavasor
when
he
thus
hear
that
there
be
other
who
be
more
backward
in
their
payment
,
even
than
himself
,
and
make
him
reflect
that
a
long
credit
than
have
yet
be
achieve
by
him
,
may
perhaps
be
within
his
reach
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
astonish
how
much
a
man
may
get
do
for
him
,
"
say
he
,
"
without
pay
anything
for
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
that
be
true
.
<EOS>
so
he
may
,
if
he
know
how
to
go
about
it
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
do
pay
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
he
do
it
through
the
nose
;
 
cent
.
<EOS>
per
cent
.
<EOS>
,
and
bad
,
for
all
his
former
shortcoming
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
many
there
be
who
never
pay
at
all
,
"
say
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Mr.
Vavasor
;
 
that
be
true
,
too
.
<EOS>
but
see
what
a
life
they
lead
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
pleasant
thing
to
be
afraid
of
come
into
your
agent
's
office
;
not
what
you
would
like
,
Mr.
Vavasor
;
 
not
if
I
know
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
be
afraid
of
meet
anyone
yet
,
"
say
Vavasor
;
"
but
I
do
not
know
what
I
may
come
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nor
never
will
,
I
will
go
bail
.
<EOS>
but
,
Lord
love
you
,
I
could
tell
you
such
tale
!
<EOS>
I
have
have
Members
of
Parliament
,
past
,
present
,
and
future
,
almost
down
on
their
knee
to
me
in
this
little
room
.
<EOS>
It
be
about
a
month
or
six
week
before
the
election
come
on
when
they
be
at
their
bad
.
<EOS>
there
be
so
much
you
see
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
for
which
a
gentleman
must
pay
ready
money
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
like
a
business
in
which
a
lawyer
be
suppose
to
find
the
capital
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
money
enough
to
pay
out
of
my
own
pocket
all
the
cost
of
all
the
metropolitan
gentleman
for
whom
I
act
,
why
,
I
could
live
on
the
interest
without
any
trouble
,
and
go
into
Parliament
myself
like
a
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
perfectly
understand
that
Mr.
Scruby
be
explain
to
him
,
with
what
good
attempt
at
delicacy
he
could
make
,
that
fund
for
the
expense
of
the
Chelsea
election
be
not
to
be
forthcoming
from
the
Great
Marlborough
Street
establishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
but
you
do
do
it
sometimes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
never
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
"
say
Mr.
Scruby
,
very
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
a
rule
,
never
.
<EOS>
I
may
advance
the
money
,
on
interest
,
of
course
,
when
I
receive
a
guarantee
from
the
candidate
's
father
,
or
from
six
or
seven
among
the
committee
,
who
must
all
be
very
substantial
,
 
very
substantial
indeed
.
<EOS>
but
in
a
general
way
I
do
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
my
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
do
;

at
any
rate
I
do
not
want
you
to
do
it
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
sure
you
do
not
,
"
say
Mr.
Scruby
,
with
a
bright
tone
of
voice
than
that
he
have
just
be
use
.
<EOS>

I
never

you
do

Mr.

Lord
bless
you
,
Mr.

<EOS>
,
I
know
the
difference
between
gentleman
as
soon
as
I
see
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
they
go
to
business
,
and
Vavasor
become
aware
that
it
would
be
think
convenient
that
he
should
lodge
with
Mr.
Scruby
,
to
his
own
account
,
a
sum
not
less
than
six
hundred
pound
within
the
next
week
,
and
it
would
be
also
necessary
that
he
should
provide
for
take
up
that
bill
,
amount
to
ninety
-
two
pound
,
which
he
have
give
to
the
landlord
of
the
"
Handsome
Man
.
<EOS>
"
in
short
,
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
borrow
a
thousand
pound
from
Alice
,
and
as
he
do
not
wish
that
the
family
attorney
of
the
Vavasors
should
be
employ
to
raise
it
,
he
communicate
to
Mr.
Scruby
as
much
of
his
plan
as
be
necessary
,
 
feel
more
hesitation
in
do
it
than
may
have
be
expect
from
him
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
do
so
,
he
be
very
intent
on
explain
also
that
the
money
take
from
his
cousin
,
and
future
bride
,
would
be
repay
to
her
out
of
the
property
in
Westmoreland
,
which
be
,
 
<EOS>
do
he
say
settle
on
himself
?
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
he
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
;
 
a
family
arrangement
,
"
say
Mr.
Scruby
,
as
he
congratulate
him
on
his
propose
marriage
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
do
not
care
a
straw
from
what
source
the
necessary
fund
may
be
draw
.
   
<EOS>
John
Grey
go
a
second
time
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
early
in
that
conversation
which
Mr.
Vavasor
have
with
his
daughter
,
and
which
be
record
a
few
page
back
,
he
implore
her
to
pause
a
while
before
she
inform
Mr.
Grey
of
her
engagement
with
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
nothing
,
however
,
on
that
point
have
be
settle
between
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
have
wish
her
to
say
that
she
would
not
write
till
he
should
have
assent
to
her
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
have
decline
to
bind
herself
in
this
way
,
and
then
they
have
go
off
to
other
thing
;
 
to
George
Vavasor
's
character
and
the
disposition
of
her
money
.
<EOS>
alice
,
however
,
have
feel
herself
bind
not
to
write
to
Mr.
Grey
quite
at
once
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
when
her
cousin
leave
her
she
have
no
appetite
for
write
such
a
letter
as
her
be
to
be
.
<EOS>
a
day
or
two
pass
by
her
in
this
way
,
and
nothing
more
be
say
by
her
or
her
father
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
the
middle
of
January
,
and
the
reader
may
remember
that
Mr.
Grey
have
promise
that
he
would
come
to
her
in
London
in
that
month
,
as
soon
as
he
should
know
that
she
have
return
from
Westmoreland
.
<EOS>
She
must
at
any
rate
do
something
to
prevent
that
visit
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
would
not
come
without
give
her
notice
.
<EOS>
She
know
enough
of
the
habit
of
the
man
to
be
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
but
she
desire
that
her
letter
to
him
should
be
in
time
to
prevent
his
to
her
;
so
when
those
few
day
be
go
,
she
sit
down
to
write
without
speak
to
her
father
again
upon
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
terrible
job
;
 
perhaps
the
most
difficult
of
all
the
difficult
task
which
her
adverse
fate
have
impose
upon
her
.
<EOS>
She
find
when
she
do
attempt
it
,
that
she
could
have
do
it
better
if
she
have
do
it
at
the
moment
when
she
be
write
the
other
letter
to
her
cousin
George
.
<EOS>
then
Kate
have
be
near
her
,
and
she
have
be
comfort
by
Kate
's
affectionate
happiness
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
strengthen
at
that
moment
by
a
feeling
that
she
be
do
the
good
in
her
power
,
if
not
for
herself
,
at
any
rate
for
other
.
<EOS>
all
that
comfort
and
all
that
strength
have
leave
her
now
.
<EOS>
the
atmosphere
of
the
fell
have
buoy
her
up
,
and
now
the
thick
air
of
London
depress
her
.
<EOS>
She
sit
for
hour
with
the
pen
in
her
hand
,
and
could
not
write
the
letter
.
<EOS>
She
let
a
day
go
by
and
a
night
,
and
still
it
be
not
write
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
know
herself
in
her
unnatural
weakness
.
<EOS>
as
the
mental
photograph
of
the
two
man
force
themselves
upon
her
,
she
could
not
force
herself
to
forget
those
word
 
<EOS>
"
look
here
,
upon
this
picture
 
and
on
this
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
be
it
that
she
now
know
how
great
be
the
difference
between
the
two
man
,
<EOS>
how
immense
the
pre
-
eminence
of
him
whom
she
have
reject
;
 
and
that
she
have
not
before
be
able
to
see
this
on
any
of
those
many
previous
occasion
on
which
she
have
compare
the
two
together
?
<EOS>
as
she
think
of
her
cousin
<EOS>
George
's
face
when
he
leave
her
room
a
few
day
since
,
and
remember
Mr.
Grey
's
countenance
when
last
he
hold
her
hand
at
Cheltenham
,
the
quiet
dignity
of
his
beauty
which
would
submit
to
show
no
consciousness
of
injury
<EOS>
,
she
could
not
but
tell
herself
that
when
Paradise
have
be
open
to
her
,
she
have
declare
herself
to
be
fit
only
for
Pandemonium
.
<EOS>
in
that
be
her
chief
misery
;
that
now
,
 
now
when
it
be
too
late
,
 
she
could
look
at
it
aright
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
letter
must
be
write
,
and
on
the
second
day
she
declare
to
herself
that
she
would
not
rise
from
her
chair
till
it
be
do
.
<EOS>
the
letter
be
write
on
that
day
and
be
post
.
<EOS>
I
will
now
ask
the
reader
to
go
down
with
me
to
Nethercoats
that
we
may
be
present
with
John
Grey
when
he
receive
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
sit
at
breakfast
in
his
study
there
,
and
opposite
to
him
,
lounge
in
an
arm
-
chair
,
with
a
_
Quarterly
_
<EOS>
in
his
hand
,
be
the
most
intimate
of
his
friend
,
Frank
Seward
,
a
fellow
of
the
college
to
which
they
have
both
belong
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Seward
be
a
clergyman
,
and
the
tutor
of
his
college
,
and
a
man
who
work
very
hard
at
Cambridge
.
<EOS>
in
the
day
of
his
leisure
he
spend
much
of
his
time
at
Nethercoats
,
and
he
be
the
only
man
to
whom
Grey
have
tell
anything
of
his
love
for
Alice
and
of
his
disappointment
.
<EOS>
even
to
Seward
he
have
not
tell
the
whole
story
.
<EOS>
He
have
at
first
inform
his
friend
that
he
be
engage
to
be
marry
,
and
as
he
have
tell
this
as
no
secret
,
 
have
even
say
that
he
hate
secret
on
such
matter
,
 
<EOS>
the
engagement
have
be
mention
in
the
common
room
of
their
college
,
and
man
at
Cambridge
know
that
Mr.
Grey
be
go
to
take
to
himself
a
wife
.
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Seward
have
be
tell
that
trouble
have
come
,
and
that
it
be
not
improbable
that
there
would
be
no
such
marriage
.
<EOS>
even
when
say
this
Mr.
Grey
tell
none
of
the
particular
,
though
he
own
to
his
friend
that
a
heavy
blow
have
strike
him
.
<EOS>
His
intimacy
with
Seward
be
of
that
thorough
kind
which
be
engender
only
out
of
such
young
and
lasting
friendship
as
have
exist
between
them
;
but
even
to
such
a
friend
as
this
Mr.
Grey
could
not
open
his
whole
heart
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
to
a
friend
who
should
also
be
his
wife
that
he
could
do
that
,
 
as
he
himself
thoroughly
understand
.
<EOS>
He
have
feel
that
such
a
friend
be
want
to
him
,
and
he
have
make
the
attempt
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
speak
of
this
as
yet
,
"
he
have
say
to
Mr.
Seward
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
when
the
matter
be
settle
,
those
few
people
who
know
me
must
know
it
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
there
may
be
a
doubt
as
yet
,
and
as
long
as
there
be
a
doubt
,
it
be
well
that
it
should
not
be
discuss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
say
no
more
than
this
,
 
have
impute
no
blame
to
Alice
,
 
have
tell
none
of
the
circumstance
;
but
Seward
have
know
that
the
girl
have
jilt
his
friend
,
and
have
make
up
his
mind
that
she
must
be
heartless
and
false
.
<EOS>
He
have
know
also
that
his
friend
would
never
look
for
any
other
such
companion
for
his
home
.
  
<EOS>
letter
be
bring
to
each
of
them
on
this
morning
,
and
Seward
's
attention
be
of
course
occupy
by
those
which
he
receive
.
<EOS>
Grey
,
as
soon
as
the
envelope
have
touch
his
hand
,
become
aware
that
one
of
them
be
from
Alice
,
and
this
he
at
once
open
.
<EOS>
He
do
it
very
calmly
,
but
without
any
of
that
bravado
of
indifference
with
which
George
Vavasor
have
receive
Alice
's
letter
from
Westmoreland
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
right
that
I
should
tell
you
at
once
,
"
say
Alice
,
rush
into
the
middle
of
her
subject
without
even
the
formality
of
the
customary
address
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
right
that
I
should
tell
you
at
once
that
 
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
the
difficulty
which
she
have
encounter
when
her
word
have
carry
her
as
far
as
this
!
 
<EOS>
"
that
my
cousin
,
George
Vavasor
,
have
repeat
to
me
his
offer
of
marriage
,
and
that
I
have
accept
it
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
chiefly
in
order
that
I
may
save
you
from
the
trouble
which
you
purpose
to
take
when
I
last
see
you
at
Cheltenham
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
tell
you
any
of
the
circumstance
of
this
engagement
,
because
I
have
no
right
to
presume
that
you
will
care
to
hear
them
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
dare
to
ask
you
to
believe
of
me
that
in
all
that
I
have
do
,
I
have
endeavour
to
act
with
truth
and
honesty

that
I
have
be
very
ignorant
,
foolish

what
you
will
<EOS>
that
be
bad

<EOS>
I
know
well
;
otherwise
there
could
not
have
be
so
much
in
the
last
few
year
of
my
life
on
which
I
be
utterly
ashamed
to
look
back
.

for
the
injury
that
I
have
do
you
,
I
can
only
express
deep
contrition

ALICE
VAVASOR
.
<EOS>
"
She
have
torment
herself
in
write
this
,
 
have
so
nearly
drive
herself
distract
with
attempt
which
she
have
destroy
,
that
she
would
not
even
read

herself
these
last

"
<EOS>
He
will
know
it
,
and
that
be
all
that
be
necessary
,
"
she
say
to
herself
as
she
send
the
letter
away
from
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
read
it
twice
over
,
leave
the
other
letter
unnotice
on
the
table
by
his
tea
-
cup
.
<EOS>
He
read
it
twice
over
,
and
the
work
of
read
it
be
one
to
him
of
intense
agony
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
he
have
feed
himself
with
hope
.
<EOS>
that
Alice
should
have
be
bring
to
think
of
her
engagement
with
him
in
a
spirit
of
doubt
and
with
a
mind
<EOS>
so
troubled
,
that
she
have
be
incline
to
attempt
an
escape
from
it
,
have
be
very
grievous
to
him
;
but
it
have
be
in
his
mind
a
fantasy
,
a
morbid
fear
of
himself
,
which
may
be
cure
by
time
.
<EOS>
He
,
at
any
rate
,
would
give
all
his
energy
towards
achieve
such
a
cure
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
one
thing
,
however
,
which
he
most
fear
;
 
which
he
have
chiefly
fear
,
though
he
have
forbid
himself
to
think
that
it
could
be
probable
,
and
this
thing
have
now
happen
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
ever
dislike
and
fear
George
Vavasor
;
 
not
from
any
effect
which
the
man
have
upon
himself
,
for
as
we
know
his
acquaintance
with
Vavasor
be
of
the
slight
;
 
but
he
have
fear
and
dislike
his
influence
upon
Alice
.
<EOS>
He
have
also
fear
the
influence
of
her
cousin
Kate
.
<EOS>
to
have
caution
Alice
against
her
cousin
would
have
be
to
him
impossible
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
his
nature
to
express
suspicion
to
one
he
love
.
<EOS>
be
the
tone
of
that
letter
remember
in
which
he
have
answer
Alice
when
she
inform
him
that
her
cousin
George
be
to
go
with
Kate
and
her
to
Switzerland
?
<EOS>
He
have
write
,
with
a
pleasant
joke
,
word
which
Alice
have
be
able
to
read
with
some
little
feeling
of
triumph
to
her
two
friend
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
so
write
because
he
like
what
he
know
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
He
dislike
all
that
he
know
of
him
.
<EOS>
but
it
have
not
be
possible
for
him
to
show
that
he
distrust
the
prudence
of
her
,
whom
,
as
his
future
wife
,
he
be
prepared
to
trust
in
all
thing
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
say
that
he
read
Alice
's
letter
with
an
agony
of
sorrow
<EOS>
;
as
he
sit
with
it
in
his
hand
he
suffer
as
,
probably
,
he
have
never
suffer
before
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
nothing
in
his
countenance
to
show
that
he
be
in
pain
.
<EOS>
Seward
have
receive
some
long
epistle
,
cross
from
end
to
end
,
 
indicative
,
I
should
say
,
of
a
not
far
distant
termination
to
that
college
tutorship
,
 
and
be
read
it
with
placid
contentment
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
occur
to
him
to
look
across
at
Grey
,
but
have
he
do
so
,
I
doubt
whether
he
would
have
see
anything
to
attract
his
attention
.
<EOS>
but
Grey
,
though
he
be
wound
,
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
dismay
.
<EOS>
there
be
less
hope
now
than
before
,
but
there
may
still
be
hope
;
 
hope
for
her
,
even
though
there
may
be
none
for
him
.
<EOS>
tiding
have
reach
his
ear
also
as
to
George
Vavasor
,
which
have
teach
him
to
believe
that
the
man
be
needy
,
reckless
,
and
on
the
brink
of
ruin
.
<EOS>
such
a
marriage
to
Alice
Vavasor
would
be
altogether
ruinous
.
<EOS>
whatever
may
be
his
own
ultimate
fate
he
would
still
seek
to
save
her
from
that
.
<EOS>
Her
cousin
,
doubtless
,
want
her
money
.
<EOS>
may
it
not
be
possible
that
he
would
be
satisfied
with
her
money
,
and
that
thus
the
woman
may
be
save
?
  
<EOS>
"
seward
,
"
he
say
at
last
,
address
his
friend
,
who
have
not
yet
come
to
the
end
of
the
last
cross
page
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
there
anything
wrong
?
"
say
Seward
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
;
 
yes
;
there
be
something
a
little
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
fear
I
must
leave
you
,
and
go
up
to
town
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nobody
ill
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
nobody
be
ill
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
go
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bole
will
take
care
of
you
,
and
you
must
not
be
angry
with
me
for
leave
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Seward
assure
him
that
he
would
not
be
in
the
least
angry
,
and
that
he
be
thoroughly
conversant
with
the
capability
and
good
intention
of
Mrs.
Bole
the
housekeeper
;
but
add
,
that
as
he
be
so
near
his
own
college
,
he
would
of
course
go
back
to
Cambridge
.
<EOS>
He
long
to
say
some
word
as
to
the
purpose
of
Grey
's
threatened
journey
;
to
make
some
inquiry
as
to
this
new
trouble
;
but
he
know
that
Grey
be
a
man
who
do
not
well
bear
close
inquiry
,
and
he
be
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
not
stay
here
?
"
say
Grey
,
after
a
minute
's
pause
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
,
old
fellow
;
I
do
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
tone
of
special
affection
in
his
voice
which
strike
Seward
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
can
be
of
the
slight
service
or
comfort
to
you
,
I
will
of
course
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grey
again
sit
silent
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
;
I
do
,
indeed
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
.
"
<EOS>
and
again
there
be
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
get
a
letter
here
from
 
Miss
Vavasor
,
"
say
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
hope
that
 
"
  
"
no
;
 
it
do
not
bring
good
news
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
I
can
tell
it
you
all
.
<EOS>
I
would
if
I
could
,
but
the
whole
story
be
one
not
to
be
tell
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
I
should
leave
false
impression
.
<EOS>
there
be
thing
which
a
man
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
there
be
,
"
say
Seward
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
you
know
it
all
as
I
know
it
;
but
that
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
there
be
thing
which
happen
in
a
day
which
it
would
take
a
lifetime
to
explain
.
<EOS>
"
then
there
be
another
pause
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
bad
news
this
morning
,
and
I
must
go
up
to
London
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
into
Ely
so
as
to
be
there
by
twelve
;
and
if
you
will
,
you
shall
drive
me
over
.
<EOS>
I
may
be
back
in
a
day
;
certainly
in
less
than
a
week
;
but
it
will
be
a
comfort
to
me
to
know
that
I
shall
find
you
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
matter
be
so
arrange
,
and
at
eleven
they
start
.
<EOS>
during
the
first
two
mile
not
a
word
be
speak
between
them
.
"
<EOS>
seward
,
"
Grey
say
at
last
,
"
if
I
fail
in
what
I
be
go
to
attempt
,
it
be
probable
that
you
will
never
hear
Alice
Vavasor
's
name
mention
by
me
again
;
but
I
want
you
always
to
bear
this
in
mind
;
 
that
at
no
moment
have
my
opinion
of
her
ever
be
change
,
nor
must
you
in
such
case
imagine
from
my
silence
that
it
have
change
.
<EOS>
do
you
understand
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
to
my
thinking
she
be
the
fine
of
God
's
creature
that
I
have
know
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
in
her
future
life
she
will
be
sever
from
me
altogether
;
but
I
shall
not
,
therefore
,
think
the
less
well
of
her
;
and
I
wish
that
you
,
as
my
friend
,
should
know
that
I
so
esteem
her
,
even
though
her
name
should
never
be
mention
between
us
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Seward
,
in
some
few
word
,
assure
him
that
it
should
be
so
,
and
then
they
finish
their
journey
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
from
the
station
at
Ely
,
Grey
send
a
message
by
the
wire
up
to
John
Vavasor
,
say
that
he
would
call
on
him
that
afternoon
at
his
office
in
Chancery
Lane
.
<EOS>
the
chance
be
always
much
against
find
Mr.
Vavasor
at
his
office
;
but
on
this
occasion
the
telegram
do
reach
him
there
,
and
he
remain
till
the
unaccustomed
hour
of
half
<EOS>
past
four
to
meet
the
man
who
be
to
have
be
his
son
-
in
-
law
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
hear
from
her
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
as
soon
as
Grey
enter
the
dingy
little
room
,
not
in
Chancery
Lane
,
but
in
its
neighbourhood
,
which
be
allocate
to
him
for
his
signing
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
 
say
Grey
;
"
she
have
write
to
me
.
"
  
"
and
tell
you
about
her
cousin
George
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
hinder
her
from
writing
,
but
she
be
very
wilful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
you
have
hinder
her
?
<EOS>
if
the
thing
be
to
be
tell
,
it
be
well
that
it
should
be
do
at
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
hope
that
there
may
be
an
escape
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
you
think
of
all
this
,
Grey
,
but
to
me
it
be
the
bitter
misfortune
that
I
have
know
.
<EOS>
and
I
have
have
some
bitter
thing
,
too
,
"
he
add
,
 
thinking
of
that
period
of
his
life
,
when
the
work
of
which
he
be
ashamed
be
first
ordain
as
his
future
task
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
escape
that
you
hope
?
"
ask
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
.
<EOS>
the
whole
thing
seem
to
me
to
be
so
mad
,
that
I
partly
trust
that
she
would
see
the
madness
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
whether
you
know
anything
of
my
nephew
George
?
"
ask
Mr.
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
little
,
"
say
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
him
to
be
utterly
an
adventurer
,
 
a
man
without
mean
and
without
principle
,
 
upon
the
whole
about
as
bad
a
man
as
you
may
meet
.
<EOS>
I
give
you
my
word
,
Grey
,
that
I
do
not
think
I
know
a
bad
man
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
marry
her
for
her
money
;
then
he
will
beggar
her
,
after
that
he
will
ill
-
treat
her
,
and
yet
what
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
prevent
the
marriage

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
how
,
my
dear
fellow
?
<EOS>
prevent
it
!
<EOS>
It
be
all
very
well
to
say
that
,

it
be
the
very
thing
I
want
to
do
.
<EOS>
but
how
be
I
to
prevent
it
?
<EOS>
She
be
as
much
her
own
master
as
you
be
yours
.
<EOS>
She
can
give
him
every
shilling
of
her
fortune
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
how
be
I
to
prevent
her
from
marry
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
her
give
him
every
shilling
of
her
fortune
to
-
morrow
,
"
say
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
be
she
to
do
then
?
"
ask
Mr.
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
 
then
,
 
then
,
 
then
let
her
come
to
me
,
"
say
John
Grey
;
and
as
he
speak
there
be
the
fragment
of
a
tear
in
his
eye
,
and
the
hint
of
quiver
in
his
voice
.
  
<EOS>
even
the
worldly
,
wear
-
out
,
unsympathetic
nature
of
John
Vavasor
be
strike
,
and
,
as
it
be
,
warm
by
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you

God
bless
you

my

I
heartily
wish
for
her
sake

I
could
look
forward
to
any
such
an
end
to
this
affair

"

why
not
look
forward
to
it

<EOS>
You
say
that

want
her
money

as

want
it

him
have

<EOS>
"
but
Grey
,
you
do
not
know
Alice
;
you
do
not
understand
my
girl

<EOS>
when
she
have
lose
her
fortune
nothing
would
induce
her
to
become
your
wife

"
  
<EOS>
"
leave
that
to
follow
as
it
may
,
"
say
John
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
Our
first
object
must
be
to
sever
her
from
a
man

who
be
,
as
you
say
,
himself
on
the
verge
of
ruin

who
would
certainly
make
her
wretched

<EOS>
I
be
here
now

not
because
I
wish
her
to
be
my

because
I
wish
that
she
should
not
become
the
wife
of
such
a
one
as

money

you
would
have
nothing
more
to

I
know
that
she
will
give
him
her
money

she
have
say
so
;

I
have
no
power
as
to
her
give
it
<EOS>

as
to
her
withholding
it

that
be
the
hardship
of
my
position

it
be
of
no
use

think
of
that
now

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
John
Grey
certainly
do
not
think
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
know
well
that
Alice
be
independent
,
and
that
she
be
not
inclined
to
give
up
that
independence
to
anyone
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
expect
that
her
father
would
be
able
to
do
much
towards
hinder
his
daughter
from
become
the
wife
of
George
Vavasor
,
but
he
have
wish
that
he
himself
and
her
father
should
be
in
accord
in
their
view
,
and
he
find
that
this
be
so
.
<EOS>
when
he
leave
Mr.
Vavasor
's
room
nothing
have
be
say
about
the
period
of
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
Grey
think
it
improbable
that
Alice
would
find
herself
able
to
give
herself
in
marriage
to
her
cousin
immediately
,
 
so
soon
after
her
breach
with
him
;
but
as
to
this
he
have
no
assurance
,
and
he
determine
to
have
the
fact
from
her
own
lip
,
if
she
would
see
him
.
<EOS>
so
he
write
to
her
,
name
a
day
on
which
he
would
call
upon
her
early
in
the
morning
;
and
have
receive
from
her
no
prohibition
,
he
be
in
Queen
Anne
Street
at
the
hour
appoint
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
conceive
a
scheme
which
he
have
not
make
known
to
Mr.
Vavasor
,
and
as
to
the
practicability
of
which
he
have
much
doubt
;
but
which
,
nevertheless
,
he
be
resolve
to
try
if
he
should
find
the
attempt
possible
.
<EOS>
He
himself
would
buy
off
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
He
have
ever
be
a
prudent
man
,
and
he
have
money
at
command
.
<EOS>
if
Vavasor
be
such
a
man
as
they
,
who
know
him
best
,
represent
him
,
such
a
purchase
may
be
possible
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
before
this
be
attempt
,
he
must
be
quite
sure
that
he
know
his
man
,
and
he
must
satisfy
himself
also
that
in
do
so
he
would
not
,
in
truth
,
add
to
Alice
's
misery
.
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
bring
himself
to
think
it
possible
that
she
do
,
in
truth
,
love
her
cousin
with
passionate
love
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
him
,
as
he
remember
what
Alice
have
be
to
himself
,
that
this
must
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
but
if
it
be
so
,
that
of
course
must
put
an
end
to
his
interference
.
<EOS>
He
think
that
if
he
see
her
he
may
learn
all
this
,
and
therefore
he
go
to
Queen
Anne
Street
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
he
must
come
if
he
will
,
"
she
say
to
herself
when
she
receive
his
note
.
<EOS>
"
It
can
make
no
matter
.
<EOS>
He
will
say
nothing
half
so
hard
to
me
as
what
I
say
to
myself
all
day
long
.
"
<EOS>
but
when
the
morning
come
,
and
the
hour
come
,
and
the
knock
at
the
door
for
which
her
ear
be
on
the
alert
,
her
heart
misgave
her
,
and
<EOS>
she
feel
that
the
present
moment
of
her
punishment
,
though
not
the
heavy
,
would
still
be
hard
to
bear
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
slowly
up
-
stair
,
 
his
step
be
ever
slow
,
 
and
gently
open
the
door
for
himself
.
<EOS>
then
,
before
he
even
look
at
her
,
he
close
it
again
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
to
explain
that
it
be
so
;
but
it
be
this
perfect
command
of
himself
at
all
season
which
have
in
part
make
Alice
afraid
of
him
,
and
drive
her
to
believe
that
they
be
not
fit
for
each
other
.
<EOS>
She
,
when
he
thus
turn
for
a
moment
from
her
,
and
then
walk
slowly
towards
her
,
stand
with
both
her
hand
lean
on
the
centre
table
of
the
room
,
and
with
her
eye
fix
upon
its
surface
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
he
say
,
walk
up
to
her
very
slowly
.
  
<EOS>
Her
whole
frame
shudder
as
she
hear
the
sweetness
of
his
voice
.
<EOS>
have
I
not
better
tell
the
truth
of
her
at
once
?
<EOS>
oh
,
if
she
could
only
have
be
his
again
!
<EOS>
what
madness
during
these
last
six
month
have
drive
her
to
such
a
plight
as
this
!
<EOS>
the
old
love
come
back
upon
her
.
<EOS>
nay
;
it
have
never
go
.
<EOS>
but
that
trust
in
his
love
return
to
her
,
 
that
trust
which
tell
her
that
such
love
and
such
worth
would
have
suffice
to
make
her
happy
.
<EOS>
but
this
confidence
in
him
be
worthless
now
!
<EOS>
even
though
he
should
desire
it
,
she
could
not
change
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
he
say
again
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
as
slowly
she
look
up
at
him
,
he
ask
her
for
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
give
it
me
,
"
he
say
,
"
as
to
an
old
friend
.
"
<EOS>
She
put
her
hand
in
his
hand
,
and
then
,
withdraw
it
,
feel
that
she
must
never
trust
herself
to
do
so
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
he
continue
,
"
I
do
not
expect
you
to
say
much
to
me
;
but
there
be
a
question
or
two
which
I
think
you
will
answer
.
<EOS>
have
a
day
be
fix
for
this
marriage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
it
be
in
a
month
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
;
 
not
for
a
year
,
"
she
reply
hurriedly
;
 
and
he
know
at
once
by
her
voice
that
she
already
dread
this
new
wedlock
.
<EOS>
whatever
of
anger
he
may
before
have
feel
for
her
be
banish
.
<EOS>
She
have
bring
herself
by
her
ill
-
judgement
,
 
by
her
ignorance
,
as
she
have
confess
,
 
to
a
sad
pass
;
but
he
believe
that
she
be
still
worthy
of
his
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
one
other
question
,
Alice
;
 
<EOS>
but
if
you
be
silent
,
I
will
not
ask
it
again
.
<EOS>
Can
you
tell
me
why
you
have
again
accept
your
cousin
's
offer
?
"
  
"
because
 
,
"
she
say
very
quickly
,
look
up
as
though
she
be
about
to
speak
with
all
her
old
courage
.
<EOS>
"
but
you
would
never
understand
me
,
"
she
say
,
 
"
and
there
can
be
no
reason
why
I
should
dare
to
hope
that
you
should
ever
think
well
of
me
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
know
that
there
be
no
love
,
 
<EOS>
no
love
for
that
man
to
whom
she
have
pledge
her
hand
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
,
on
the
other
hand
,
how
strong
,
how
unchanged
,
how
true
be
her
love
for
himself
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
of
himself
he
be
think
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
He
desire
to
learn
whether
she
would
suffer
,
if
by
any
scheme
he
may
succeed
in
break
off
this
marriage
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
ask
her
whether
she
be
to
be
marry
at
once
,
she
have
shudder
at
the
thought
.
<EOS>
when
he
ask
her
why
she
have
accept
her
cousin
,
she
have
falter
,
and
hint
at
some
excuse
which
he
may
fail
to
understand
.
<EOS>
have
she
love
George
Vavasor
,
he
could
have
understand
that
well
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
he
say
,
speak
still
very
slowly
,
"
nothing
have
ever
yet
be
do
which
need
to
a
certainty
separate
you
and
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
persistent
man
,
and
I
do
not
even
yet
give
up
all
hope
.
<EOS>
a
year
be
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
as
you
say
yourself
,
I
do
not
as
yet
quite
understand
you
.
<EOS>
but
,
Alice
,
 
and
I
think
that
the
position
in
which
we
stand
a
few
month
since
justify
me
in
say
so
without
offence
,
 
I
love
you
now
as
well
as
ever
,
and
should
thing
change
with
you
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
tell
you
with
how
much
joy
and
eagerness
I
should
take
you
back
to
my
bosom
.
<EOS>
My
heart
be
yours
now
as
it
have
be
since
I
know
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
then
he
again
just
touch
her
hand
,
and
leave
her
before
she
have
be
able
to
answer
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Tombe
's
Advice
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
sit
alone
for
an
hour
without
move
when
John
Grey
have
leave
her
,
and
the
last
word
which
he
have
utter
be
sound
in
her
ear
all
the
time
,
"
My
heart
be
still
yours
,
as
it
have
be
since
I
know
you
.
<EOS>
"
there
have
be
something
in
his
word
which
have
soothe
her
spirit
,
and
have
,
for
the
moment
,
almost
comfort
her
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
he
do
not
despise
her
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
speak
such
word
as
these
to
her
have
he
not
still
hold
her
high
in
his
esteem
.
<EOS>
Nay
;
 
have
he
not
even
declare
that
he
would
yet
take
her
as
his
own
if
she
would
come
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
you
with
how
much
joy
I
would
take
you
back
to
my
bosom
!
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
that
may
never
be
.
<EOS>
but
yet
the
assurance
have
be
sweet
to
her
;
 
dangerously
sweet
,
as
she
soon
tell
herself
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
she
have
lose
her
Eden
,
but
it
be
something
to
her
that
the
master
of
the
garden
have
not
himself
drive
her
forth
.
<EOS>
She
sit
there
,
think
of
her
fate
,
as
though
it
belong
to
some
other
one
,
 
not
to
herself
;
as
though
it
be
a
tale
that
she
have
read
.
<EOS>
Herself
she
have
shipwreck
altogether
;
but
though
she
may
sink
,
she
have
not
be
thrust
from
the
ship
by
hand
which
she
love
.
  
<EOS>
but
would
it
not
have
be
well
that
he
should
have
scorn
her
and
revile
her
?
<EOS>
have
he
be
able
to
do
so
<EOS>
,
he
at
least
would
have
escape
the
grief
of
disappointed
love
.
<EOS>
have
he
learn
to
despise
her
,
he
would
have
cease
to
regret
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
right
to
feel
consolation
in
the
fact
that
his
suffering
be
equal
to
her
own
.
<EOS>
but
when
she
think
of
this
,
she
tell
herself
that
it
could
not
be
that
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
,
she
say
,
not
passionate
by
nature
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
it
be
the
mistake
she
have
ever
make
when
sum
up
the
item
of
his
character
!
<EOS>
He
may
be
persistent
,
she
think
,
in
still
strive
to
do
that
upon
which
he
have
once
resolve
.
<EOS>
He
have
say
so
,
and
that
which
he
say
be
always
true
to
the
letter
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
when
this
thing
which
he
still
choose
to
pursue
should
have
be
put
absolutely
beyond
his
reach
,
he
would
not
allow
his
calm
bosom
to
be
harass
by
a
vain
regret
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
too
whole
at
every
point
,
 
<EOS>
so
Alice
tell
herself
,
 
to
allow
his
happiness
to
be
mar
by
such
an
accident
.
  
<EOS>
but
must
the
accident
occur
?
<EOS>
be
there
no
chance
that
he
may
be
save
,
even
from
such
trouble
as
may
follow
upon
such
a
loss
?
<EOS>
Could
it
not
be
possible
that
he
may
be
gratify
,
 
since
it
would
gratify
him
,
 
and
that
she
may
be
save
!
<EOS>
over
and
over
again
she
consider
this
,
 
but
always
as
though
it
be
another
woman
whom
she
would
fain
save
,
and
not
herself
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
know
that
her
own
fate
be
fix
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
mad
when
she
have
do
the
thing
,
but
the
thing
be
not
on
that
account
the
less
do
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
mad
when
she
have
trust
herself
abroad
with
two
person
,
both
of
whom
,
as
she
have
well
know
,
be
intent
on
wrench
her
happiness
from
out
of
her
grasp
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
mad
when
she
have
tell
herself
,
whilst
walk
over
the
Westmoreland
fell
,
that
after
all
she
may
as
well
marry
her
cousin
,
since
that
other
marriage
be
then
beyond
her
reach
!
<EOS>
Her
two
cousin
have
succeed
in
blight
all
the
hope
of
her
life
;
 
but
what
could
she
now
think
of
herself
in
that
she
have
be
so
weak
as
to
submit
to
such
usage
from
their
hand
?
<EOS>
alas
!
 
<EOS>
she
tell
herself
,
admit
in
her
misery
all
her
weakness
,
 
alas
<EOS>
,
she
have
no
mother
.
<EOS>
She
have
glory
in
her
independence
,
and
this
have
come
of
it
!
<EOS>
She
have
scorn
the
prudence
of
Lady
Macleod
,
and
her
scorn
have
bring
her
to
this
pass
!
  
<EOS>
be
she
to
give
herself
bodily
,
 
body
and
soul
,
as
she
say
aloud
in
her
solitary
agony
,
 
to
a
man
whom
she
do
not
love
?
<EOS>
Must
she
submit
to
his
caress
,
 
lie
on
his
bosom
,
 
turn
herself
warmly
to
his
kiss
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
"
she
say
,
"
no
,
"
 
speak
audibly
,
as
she
walk
about
the
room
;
"
no
;
 
<EOS>
it
be
not
in
my
bargain
;
I
never
mean
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
if
so
what
have
she
mean
;
 
what
have
be
her
dream
?
<EOS>
of
what
marriage
have
she
think
,
when
she
be
write
that
letter
back
to
George
Vavasor
?
<EOS>
how
be
I
to
analyse
her
mind
,
and
make
her
thought
and
feeling
intelligible
to
those
who
may
care
to
trouble
themselves
with
the
study
?
<EOS>
any
sacrifice
she
would
make
for
her
cousin
which
one
friend
could
make
for
another
.
<EOS>
She
would
fight
his
battle
with
her
money
,
with
her
word
,
with
her
sympathy
.
<EOS>
She
would
sit
with
him
if
he
need
it
,
and
speak
comfort
to
him
by
the
hour
.
<EOS>
His
disgrace
should
be
her
disgrace
;
 
his
glory
her
glory
;
 
his
pursuit
her
pursuit
.
<EOS>
be
not
that
the
marriage
to
which
she
have
consent
?
<EOS>
but
he
have
come
to
her
and
ask
her
for
a
kiss
,
and
she
have
shudder
before
him
,
when
he
make
the
demand
.
<EOS>
then
that
other
one
have
come
and
have
touch
her
hand
,
and
the
fibre
of
her
body
have
seem
to
melt
within
her
at
the
touch
,
so
that
she
could
have
fall
at
his
foot
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
do
very
wrong
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
she
have
do
wrong
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
she
have
sin
with
that
sin
which
specially
disgrace
a
woman
.
<EOS>
She
have
say
that
she
would
become
the
wife
of
a
man
to
whom
she
could
not
cleave
with
a
wife
's
love
;
and
,
mad
with
a
vile
ambition
,
she
have
give
up
the
man
for
whose
modest
love
<EOS>
her
heart
be
long
.
<EOS>
She
have
throw
off
from
her
that
wondrous
aroma
of
precious
delicacy
,
which
be
the
great
treasure
of
womanhood
.
<EOS>
She
have
sin
against
her
sex
;
and
,
in
an
agony
of
despair
,
as
she
crouch
down
upon
the
floor
with
her
head
against
her
chair
,
she
tell
herself
that
there
be
no
pardon
for
her

<EOS>
She
understand
it
now
,
and
know
that
she
could
not
forgive
herself
.
  
<EOS>
but
can
you
forgive
her
,
delicate
reader
?
<EOS>
or
be
I
ask
the
question
too
early
in
my
story
?
<EOS>
for
myself
,
I
have
forgive
her
.
<EOS>
the
story
of
the
struggle
have
be
present
to
my
mind
for
many
year
,
 
and
I
have
learn
to
think
that
even
this
offence
against
womanhood
may
,
with
deep
repentance
,
be
forgive
.
<EOS>
and
you
also
must
forgive
her
before
we
close
the
book
,
or
else
my
story
will
have
be
tell
amiss
.
  
<EOS>
but
let
us
own
that
she
have
sin
,
 
almost
damnably
,
almost
past
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
what
;
 
think
that
she
know
what
love
mean
,
and
not
know
which
of
two
she
love
!
<EOS>
what
;
 
doubt
,
of
two
man
for
whose
arm
she
long
,
of
which
the
kiss
would
be
sweet
to
bear
;
on
which
side
lie
the
modesty
of
her
maiden
love
!
<EOS>
faugh
!
<EOS>
She
have
submit
to
pollution
of
heart
and
feeling
before
she
have
bring
herself
to
such
a
pass
as
this
.
<EOS>
come
;
 
<EOS>
let
us
see
if
it
be
possible
that
she
may
be
cleanse
by
the
fire
of
her
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
I
to
do
?
"
<EOS>
She
pass
that
whole
day
in
ask
herself
that
question
.
<EOS>
She
be
herself
astounded
at
the
rapidity
with
which
the
conviction
have
force
itself
upon
her
that
a
marriage
with
her
cousin
would
be
to
her
almost
impossible
;
and
could
she
permit
it
to
be
say
of
her
that
she
have
thrice
in
her
career
<EOS>
jilt
a
promised
suitor
,
 
that
three
time
she
would
go
back
from
her
word
because
her
fancy
have
change
?
<EOS>
where
could
she
find
the
courage
to
tell
her
father
,
to
tell
Kate
,
to
tell
even
George
himself
,
that
her
purpose
be
again
alter
?
<EOS>
but
she
have
a
year
at
her
disposal
.
<EOS>
if
only
during
that
year
he
would
take
her
money
and
squander
it
,
and
then
require
nothing
further
of
her
hand
,
may
she
not
thus
escape
the
doom
before
her
?
<EOS>
may
it
not
be
possible
that
the
refusal
should
this
time
come
from
him
?
<EOS>
but
she
succeed
in
make
one
resolve
.
<EOS>
She
think
at
least
that
she
succeed
.
<EOS>
come
what
may
,
she
would
never
stand
with
him
at
the
altar
.
<EOS>
while
there
be
a
cliff
from
which
she
may
fall
,
water
that
would
cover
her
,
a
death
-
deal
grain
that
may
be
mix
in
her
cup
,
she
could
not
submit
herself
to
be
George
Vavasor
's
wife
.
<EOS>
to
no
ear
could
she
tell
of
this
resolve
.
<EOS>
to
no
friend
could
she
hint
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
She
owe
her
money
to
the
man
after
what
have
pass
between
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
right
to
count
upon
such
assistance
as
that
would
give
him
,
and
he
should
have
it
.
<EOS>
only
as
his
betroth
she
could
give
it
him
,
for
she
understand
well
that
if
there
be
any
breach
between
them
,
his
accepting
of
such
aid
would
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
her
money
,
and
then
,
when
the
day
come
,
some
escape
should
be
find
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
her
father
come
to
her
,
and
it
may
be
as
well
to
explain
that
Mr.
Grey
have
see
him
again
that
day
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
,
when
he
leave
Queen
Anne
Street
,
have
go
to
his
lawyer
,
and
from
thence
have
make
his
way
to
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
It
be
between
five
and
six
when
Mr.
Vavasor
come
back
to
his
house
,
and
he
then
find
his
daughter
sit
over
the
drawing
-
room
fire
,
without
light
,
in
the
gloom
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
have
return
with
Grey
to
the
lawyer
's
chamber
,
and
have
from
thence
come
direct
to
his
own
house
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
startle
at
the
precision
with
which
all
the
circumstance
of
his
daughter
's
position
have
be
explain
to
a
mild
-
eyed
old
gentleman
,
with
a
bald
head
,
who
carry
on
his
business
in
a
narrow
,
dark
,
clean
street
,
behind
doctor

Commons

<EOS>
Mr.
Tombe
be
his
name
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
;
"
Mr.
Grey
have
say
,
when
Mr.
Vavasor
have
ask
as
to
the
peculiar
nature
of
Mr.
Tombe
's
business
;
"
he
be
not
specially
an
ecclesiastical
lawyer
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
partner
at
Ely
,
and
be
always
employ
by
my
father
,
and
by
most
of
the
clergy
there
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Tombe
have
evince
no
surprise
,
no
dismay
,
and
certainly
no
mock
delicacy
,
when
the
whole
affair
be
under
discussion
.
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
be
to
get
present
money
,
but
,
 
if
it
could
be
so
arrange
 
from
John
Grey
's
store
rather
than
from
those
belong
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tombe
could
probably
arrange
that
with
Mr.
Vavasor
's
lawyer
,
who
would
no
doubt
be
able
to
make
difficulty
as
to
raise
ready
money
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tombe
would
be
able
to
raise
ready
money
without
difficulty
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
at
last
,
George
Vavasor
be
to
be
make
to
surrender
his
bride
,
take
or
have
take
the
price
of
his
bargain

<EOS>
John
Vavasor
sit
by
in
silence
as
the
arrangement
be
be
make
,
not
know
how
to
speak
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
money
with
which
to
give
assistance
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
to
understand
from
the
lady
's
father
,
"
Grey
say
to
the
lawyer
,
"
that
the
marriage
would
be
regard
by
him
with
as
much
dismay
as
by
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
;
 
it
would
be
ruinous
,
"
Mr.
Vavasor
have
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
you
see

<EOS>
Mr.

Mr.

on

be
not
such
as
we
believe
him
to

he
can
prove
it
by
his
conduct

<EOS>
if
he
be
worthy
of
her

he
can
then
take
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
merely
wish
to
open
her
eye

Mr.

say
the
mild

eyed
lawyer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish

the

He

so
the
interview
have
be

Mr.

<EOS>
alice

<EOS>
He
be
desirous
of
propitiate
her
;
but
be
at
the
same
time
desirous
of
carry
some
point
in
which
he
think
it
probable
that
she
would
oppose
him

<EOS>
"
well
;
my

I
do
not

no

I
think
there
be
no

indeed

I
can
hardly

so

I
have

<EOS>
I
can
only
say
that

have
not

me
yet

that
I
should
wish
to
oblige
him
whenever
he
may
do
so

to
what
extent

Alice

I

about
four
hundred

Heaven

then
he
explain
to
her
that
in

it
could

the
day

It

a
light

spirited

chatty

amusing
letter

intend
to
be
happy
in
its
tone
,
 
intend
to
have
a
flavour
of
happiness
,
but
just
fail
through
the
too
apparent
meaning
of
a
word
here
and
there

<EOS>
"
You
will
see
that
I
be
at
Matching

the

at

be
now

my

I
fear
not
so
profitably

she
would
induce
me
to

You

She

that
wicked
evening

<EOS>
I
go
there
alone
sometimes

fancy
that
I
hear
such
voice
from

see
such
face
through
the
broken
window
!
<EOS>
all
the

Pallisers
come

at

tell
me
that

there

window

Sir

I
tell

the

beautiful

up

London
early
in

session

<EOS>
when
George
Vavasor
leave
Mr.
Scruby
's
office
 
the
attentive
reader
will
remember
that
he
do
call
upon
Mr.
Scruby
,
the
Parliamentary
lawyer
,
and
there
recognise
the
necessity
of
put
himself
in
possession
of
a
small
sum
of
money
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
;
 
when
he
leave
the
attorney
's
office

he
be
well
aware
that
the
work
to
be
do
be
still

him

he
know
also
that
the
job
to
be
undertake

a
very
disagreeable
job

<EOS>
He
do
not
like
the
task

borrow
his

money

<EOS>
We
all

very
dirty

half
sovereign
with
scorn

get
it

apparent
confidence

almost
more
painful

never
will
pay
even
that
fellow
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
comfortless
unsatisfying
trade
,
that
of
live
upon
other
people
's
money
.
  
<EOS>
how
be
George
Vavasor
to
make
his
first
step
towards
get
his
hand
into
his
cousin
's
purse
?
<EOS>
He
have
go
to
her
ask
for
her
love
,
and
she
have
shudder
when
he
ask
her
.
<EOS>
that
have
be
the
commencement
of
their
life
under
their
new
engagement
.
<EOS>
He
know
very
well
that
the
money
would
be
forthcoming
when
he
demand
it
,
 
but
under
their
present
joint
circumstance
<EOS>
,
how
be
he
to
make
the
demand
?
<EOS>
if
he
write
to
her
,
should
he
simply
ask
for
money
,
and
make
no
allusion
to
his
love
?
<EOS>
if
he
go
to
her
in
person
,
should
he
make
his
visit
a
mere
visit
of
business
,
 
as
he
may
call
on
his
banker
?
  
<EOS>
He
resolve
at
last
that
Kate
should
do
the
work
for
him
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
have
feel
all
along
that
it
would
be
well
that
Kate
should
act
as
ambassador
between
him
and
Alice
in
money
matter
,
as
she
have
long
do
in
other
thing
.
<EOS>
He
could
talk
to
Kate
as
he
could
not
talk
to
Alice
;
 
and
then
,
between
the
woman
,
those
hard
money
necessity
would
be
soften
down
by
a
romantic
phraseology
which
he
would
not
himself
know
how
to
use
with
any
effect
.
<EOS>
He
make
up
his
mind
to
see
Kate
,
and
with
this
view
he
go
down
to
Westmoreland
;
and
take
himself
to
a
small
wayside
inn
at
Shap
among
the
fell
,
which
have
be
know
to
him
of
old
.
<EOS>
He
give
his
sister
notice
that
he
would
be
there
,
and
beg
her
to
come
over
to
him
as
early
as
she
may
find
it
possible
on
the
morning
after
his
arrival
.
<EOS>
He
himself
reach
the
place
late
in
the
evening
by
train
from
London
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
station
at
Shap
,
by
which
the
railway
company
no
doubt
conceive
that
it
have
confer
on
that
somewhat
rough
and
remote
locality
all
the
advantage
of
a
refined
civilization
;
but
I
doubt
whether
the
Shappites
have
be
thankful
for
the
favour
.
<EOS>
the
landlord
at
the
inn
,
for
one
,
be
not
thankful
.
<EOS>
Shap
have
be
a
place
owe
all
such
life
as
it
have
possess
to
coach
and
post
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
a
stage
on
the
high
road
from
Lancaster
to
Carlisle
,
and
though
it
lie
high
and
bleak
among
the
fell
,
and
be
a
cold
,
windy
,
thinly
-
populated
place
,
 
fill
all
traveller
with
thankfulness
that
they
have
not
be
make
Shappites
,
nevertheless
,
it
have
have
its
glory
in
its
coaching
and
posting
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
that
there
be
man
and
woman
who
look
back
with
a
fond
regret
to
the
palmy
day
of
Shap
.
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
reach
the
little
inn
about
nine
in
the
evening
on
a
night
that
be
pitchy
dark
,
and
in
a
wind
which
make
it
necessary
for
him
to
hold
his
hat
on
to
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
what
a
beastly
country
to
live
in
,
"
he
say
to
himself
,
resolve
that
he
would
certainly
sell
Vavasor
Hall
in
spite
of
all
family
association
,
if
ever
the
power
to
do
so
should
be
his
.
"
<EOS>
what
trash
it
be
,
"
he
say
,
"
hang
on
to
such
a
place
as
that
without
the
mean
of
live
like
a
gentleman
,
simply
because
one
's
ancestor
have
do
so
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
express
a
doubt
to
himself
whether
all
the
world
contain
a
more
ignorant
,
opinionated
,
useless
old
man
than
his
grandfather
,
 
or
,
in
short
,
a
great
fool
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Mr.
George
,
"
say
the
landlord
as
soon
as
he
see
him
,
"
a
sight
of
you
be
guid
for
sair
een
.
<EOS>
It
be
o'er
lang
since
you
have
be
<EOS>
doon
amang
the
fell
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
George
do
not
want
to
converse
with
the
innkeeper
,
or
to
explain
how
it
be
that
he
do
not
visit
Vavasor
Hall
.
<EOS>
the
innkeeper
,
no
doubt
,
know
all
about
it
,
 
know
that
the
grandfather
have
quarrel
with
his
grandson
,
and
know
the
reason
why
;
but
George
,
if
he
suspect
such
knowledge
,
do
not
choose
to
refer
to
it
.
<EOS>
so
he
simply
grunt
something
in
reply
,
and
get
himself
in
before
a
spark
of
fire
which
hardly
be
burn
in
a
public
room
with
a
sandy
floor
,
beg
that
the
little
sitting
-
room
up
-
stair
may
be
get
ready
for
him
.
<EOS>
there
he
pass
the
evening
in
solitude
,
give
no
encouragement
to
the
landlord
,
who
,
nevertheless
,
look
him
up
three
or
four
time
,
 
till
at
last
George
<EOS>
say
that
his
head
ache
,
and
that
he
would
wish
to
be
alone
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
always
one
of
them
cankery
chiel
as
never
have
a
kindly
word
for
man
nor
beast
,
"
say
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
"
seem
as
though
that
raw
slash
in
his
face
have
go
right
through
into
his
heart
.
"
<EOS>
after
that
George
be
leave
alone
,
and
sit
think
whether
it
would
not
be
well
to
ask
Alice
for
two
thousand
pound
at
once
,
 
so
as
to
save
him
from
the
disagreeable
necessity
of
a
second
borrowing
before
their
marriage
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
uneasy
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
have
flatter
himself
through
it
all
that
his
cousin
have
love
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
feel
sure
that
such
be
the
case
while
they
be
together
in
Switzerland
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
determine
to
give
up
John
Grey
,
of
course
he
have
tell
himself
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
at
once
answer
his
first
subsequent
overture
with
an
assent
,
he
have
of
course
be
certain
that
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
dark
,
selfish
,
and
even
dishonest
as
he
be
,
he
have
,
nevertheless
,
enjoy
something
of
a
lover
's
true
pleasure
in
believe
that
Alice
have
still
love
him
through
all
their
mischance
.
<EOS>
but
his
joy
have
<EOS>
in
a
moment
be
turn
into
gall
during
that
interview
in
Queen
Anne
Street
.
<EOS>
He
have
read
the
truth
at
a
glance
.
<EOS>
a
man
must
be
very
vain
,
or
else
very
little
use
to
such
matter
,
who
at
George
Vavasor
's
age
can
not
understand
the
feeling
with
which
a
woman
receive
him
.
<EOS>
when
Alice
contrive
as
she
have
do
to
escape
the
embrace
he
be
so
well
justified
in
ask
,
he
know
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
He
be
sore
at
heart
,
and
very
angry
withal
.
<EOS>
He
could
have
readily
spurn
her
from
him
,
and
reject
her
who
have
once
reject
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
do
so
have
not
his
need
for
her
money
restrain
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
man
who
could
deceive
himself
in
such
matter
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
this
be
so
,
and
he
tell
himself
that
he
be
a
rascal
.
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
Hall
be
,
by
the
road
,
about
five
mile
from
Shap
,
and
it
be
not
altogether
an
easy
task
for
Kate
to
get
over
to
the
village
without
inform
her
grandfather
that
the
visit
be
to
be
make
,
and
what
be
its
purport
.
<EOS>
She
could
,
indeed
,
walk
,
and
the
walk
would
not
be
so
long
as
that
she
have
take
with
Alice
to
Swindale
fall
;
 
but
walk
to
an
inn
on
a
high
road
,
be
not
the
same
thing
as
walk
to
a
point
on
a
hill
side
over
a
lake
.
<EOS>
have
she
be
dirty
,
draggle
,
and
wet
through
on
Swindale
<EOS>
fall
,
it
would
have
simply
be
matter
for
mirth
;
but
her
brother
she
know
would
not
have
like
to
see
her
enter
the
Lowther
arm
at
Shap
in
such
a
condition
.
<EOS>
It
,
therefore
,
become
necessary
that
she
should
ask
her
grandfather
to
lend
her
the
jaunting
car
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
do
you
want
to
go
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
sharply
.
<EOS>
in
such
establishment
as
that
at
Vavasor
Hall
the
family
horse
be
generally
use
for
double
duty
.
<EOS>
though
he
draw
the
lady
of
the
house
one
day
,
he
be
not
too
proud
to
draw
manure
on
the
next
.
<EOS>
and
it
will
always
be
find
that
the
master
of
the
house
give
a
great
preference
to
the
manure
over
the
lady
.
<EOS>
the
squire
at
Vavasor
have
come
to
do
so
to
such
an
extent
that
he
regard
any
application
for
the
animal
's
service
as
an
encroachment
.
  
<EOS>
"
only
to
Shap
,
grandpapa
.
"
  
"
to
Shap
!
<EOS>
what
on
earth
can
take
you
to
Shap
?
<EOS>
there
be
no
shop
at
Shap
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
go
to
do
shopping
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
some
one
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
whom
can
you
want
to
see
at
Shap
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
it
occur
to
Kate
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
that
she
may
as
well
tell
her
grandfather
the
fact
.
<EOS>
"
My
brother
have
come
down
,
"
she
say
;
"
and
be
at
the
inn
there
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
intend
to
tell
you
,
as
I
do
not
wish
to
mention
his
name
till
you
have
consent
to
receive
him
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
he
expect
to
come
here
now
;
 
do
he
?
"
say
the
squire
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
have
no
expectation
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
He
have
come
down
simply
to
see
me
;
 
about
business
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
business
!
<EOS>
what
business
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
want
to
get
your
money
from
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
with
reference
to
his
marriage
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
want
me
to
use
my
influence
with
Alice
that
it
may
not
be
delay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
look
here
,
Kate
;
if
ever
you
lend
him
your
money
,
or
any
of
it
,
 
that
is
,
of
the
principal
I
mean
,
 
I
will
never
speak
to
him
again
under
any
circumstance
.
<EOS>
and
more
than
that
!
<EOS>
look
here
,
Kate
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
all
that
have
past
and
go
,
the
property
will
become
his
for
his
life
when
I
die
,
 
unless
I
change
my
will
.
<EOS>
if
he
get
your
money
from
you
,
I
will
change
it
,
and
he
shall
not
be
a
shill
rich
at
my
death
than
he
be
now
.
<EOS>
You
can
have
the
horse
to
go
to
Shap
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
what
unlucky
chance
have
it
be
which
have
put
this
idea
into
the
old
squire
's
head
on
this
especial
morning
?
<EOS>
Kate
have
resolve
that
she
would
entreat
her
brother
to
make
use
of
her
little
fortune
.
<EOS>
She
fear
that
he
be
now
come
with
some
reference
to
his
cousin
's
money
,
 
that
something
be
to
be
do
to
enable
him
to
avail
himself
of
his
cousin
's
offer
;
and
Kate
,
almost
blush
in
the
solitude
of
her
chamber
at
the
thought
,
be
determine
that
her
brother
must
be
save
from
such
temptation
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
money
be
necessary
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
he
could
not
stand
a
second
contest
without
assistance
.
<EOS>
with
all
their
confidence
,
he
have
never
tell
her
much
of
his
pecuniary
circumstance
in
the
world
,
but
she
be
almost
sure
that
he
be
a
poor
man
.
<EOS>
He
have
say
as
much
as
that
to
her
,
and
in
his
letter
desire
her
to
come
to
him
at
Shap
,
he
have
insert
a
word
or
two
purposely
intend
to
prepare
her
mind
for
monetary
consideration
.
  
<EOS>
as
she
be
jog
along
over
the
rough
road
to
Shap
,
she
make
up
her
mind
that
Aunt
Greenow
would
be
the
proper
person
to
defray
the
expense
of
the
come
election
.
<EOS>
to
give
Kate
her
due
she
would
have
give
up
every
shilling
of
her
own
money
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
or
any
feeling
that
her
brother
would
be
wrong
to
accept
it
.
<EOS>
nor
would
she
,
perhaps
,
have
be
unalterably
oppose
to
his
take
Alice
's
money
,
have
Alice
simply
be
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
as
vavasor
they
be
bind
to
stand
by
the
future
head
of
the
family
in
an
attempt
which
be
to
be
make
,
as
she
feel
,
for
the
general
Vavasor
interest
.
<EOS>
but
she
could
not
endure
to
think
that
her
brother
should
take
the
money
of
the
girl
whom
he
be
engage
to
marry
.
<EOS>
Aunt
Greenow
's
money
she
think
be
fair
game
.
<EOS>
Aunt
Greenow
herself
have
make
various
liberal
offer
to
herself
which
Kate
have
decline
,
not
care
to
be
under
pecuniary
obligation
even
to
Aunt
Greenow
without
necessity
;
but
she
feel
that
for
such
a
purpose
as
her
brother
's
contest
,
she
nee
not
hesitate
to
ask
for
assistance
,
and
she
think
also
that
such
assistance
would
be
forthcoming
.
  
<EOS>
"
Grandpapa
know
that
you
be
here
,
George
,
"
say
Kate
,
when
their
first
greeting
be
over

"
the
deuce

<EOS>
and
why
do
you
tell
him
?
"
  
<EOS>

I
could
not

the
car
to
come
in
without

it

<EOS>
"
what
nonsense
!
<EOS>
as
if
you
could
not
have
make
any
excuse

I
be
particularly
anxious
that
he
should
not
guess
that
I
be
here

<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
that
it
can
make
any

George

I
see
that
it
can

a
very
great
difference

It
may
prevent
my
ever

able
to
get
near
him
again

coming

him
alter
his
will
,
and
leave
me
in
the
position
which
I
have
a
right
to
expect
,
would
take
more
time
than
the
whole
property
be
worth
.
<EOS>
and
he
would
endeavour
to
tie
me
down
in
some
way
I
could
not
stand
;
 
perhaps
ask
me
to
give
up
my
notion
for
go
into
Parliament
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
may
ask
you
,

he

not
make
it
ground
for
another
quarrel
,
if
you
refuse
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
so
unreasonable
and
ignorant
that
I
be
better
away
from
him

<EOS>
but
,
Kate
,
you
have
not

me
on
my
matrimonial
prospect

<EOS>

indeed
I
do
,
George

when
I

do
you

<EOS>
well

I

I
do
not

very
strong
congratulatory
tone

as

,
perhaps
it
may
be
as
well
for
all

that

about
the
good
that
can

for
it

<EOS>

oh
,
George

<EOS>

You
see
I
be
not
romantic

Kate

as
you
be

<EOS>
half
a
dozen

small
income

not

themselves

desirable

You

tell

want
some
money

day

for
immediate
use

I
have
none

whatever
I

yours

say
Kate
,
in
a
hesitating
voice
,
which
too
plainly
pronounce
her
misery
as
she
make
the
offer
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
refrain
herself
from
make
it
.
<EOS>
though
her
grandfather
's
threat
be
ring
in
her
ear
,
 
though
she
know
that
she
may
be
ruin
her
brother
by
propose
such
a
loan

she
have
no
alternative

<EOS>
when
her
brother
tell
her
of
his
want
of
money

she
could
not
abstain
from
tender
to
him
the
use
of
what
be
her
own

no
;
"

he
.

"
I
shall
not

I
shall
not

<EOS>
I
should
not

it
right

<EOS>
all
that
you
have
would
only
just
suffice
for
my
present
want
,

I
should
not
choose
to
make
you
a
beggar

there
would
,
moreover
,
be
a
difficulty
about
readjust
the
payment

"
  
<EOS>
"
there
would
be
no
difficulty

no

us
two

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not

it
right

therefore
let
there
be
an
end
of
it
,

say
George
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
have
in
it
something
of
magniloquence
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
you
wish
then
?
"
say
Kate
,
who
know
too
well
what
he
do
wish

<EOS>
"
I
will
explain
to
you
.
<EOS>
when
Alice
and
I
be
married
,
of
course
there
will
be
a
settlement
make
on
her
,
and
as
we
be
both
the
grandchild
of
the
old
squire
<EOS>
I
shall
propose
that
the
Vavasor
property
shall
be
her
for
life

event

her
outlive
me

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"

Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
if
this
be
do
,
there
can
be
no
harm
in
my
forestalling
some
of
her
property
,
which
,
under
the
circumstance
of
such
a
settlement
,
would
of
course
become
mine
when
we
be

the
squire
may
leave
the
property

whom

<EOS>
"
We
know
very
well
that
he
will
not
,
at
any
rate

leave
it
out
of
the
family

<EOS>
in
fact
,
he
would
only
be
too
glad
to
consent
to
such
an
agreement
as
that
I
have
propose
,
because
he
would
thereby
rob
me
of
all
power

the
matter

that
could
not

do
till
you
be

"
  
<EOS>

look
here

Kate

do
not
you
make
difficulty

<EOS>
and
now
,
as
he
look
at
her
,
the
cicature
on
his
face
seem
to
open
and
yawn
at
her
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
mean
to
say
that

do
say
so

I
will
go
back
to
London

<EOS>

I
would

anything

<EOS>

yes

anybody
could

as
much

an
offer

be
to
keep
to
yourself
the
power

decide
what
be
wrong

<EOS>
Will
you
write
to
Alice
,

well
still
,
go
to
her
,

explain
that
I
want
the
money

how
can
I
go

now

You
can
do
it
very
well

if
you
choose

if
that
be
too
much
,
then
write
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
will
come
much
well
from
you

from
me
;
write
to
her
,

explain
that
I
must
pay
in
advance
the
expense
of
this
contest
,

that
I
can
not
look
for
success
unless
I
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
the
demand
would
come
so
quick
on
me
;
but
they
know
that
I
be
not
a
man
of
capital
,

therefore
I
can
not
expect
them
to
carry
on
the
fight
for
me

know

money
be
sure

scruby
have
be
bite
two

practicable

allow

to
be

good
judge

what
I
ought
to
do

what
I
ought
not

Alice
herself
understand
the

perfectly

well

enough

awake

the
fact

ashamed

the
thing
he
be
about

do

so
much
ashamed

it

desirous

voice

want
you
to
write

at

sure

not

me

sacred

you
keep
it
for
read

I

it

I

do
so

at

you
come

to
beg

no

I

in
the
mood
I
be
in

I

I
will
tell

George

I
wonder
whether

occur

him

at

the

She
hesitate

almost
do

three

<EOS>
to
this
George
consent
as
though
he
be
yield
a
great
deal
;
and
Kate
,
with
a
sore
conscience
,
with
a
full
knowledge
that
she
be
undertake
to
do
wrong
,
promise
that
she
would
apply
to
Alice

thereupon
,
George
graciously
consent

proceed
to
his

put
together
his
clothe
with
a
view
to

visit

I
thank
Providence

Kate

that
circumstance

indeed
you

very
few
word

they
reach
the
old
lodge

Mr.

be
that

the

who
come
out

the
broken

It

equally
sincere

George
have
never

the

"
yes

go
in

the

very
angrily

<EOS>
"
go
in

"
  
<EOS>
George
go
in
,
shrug
his
shoulder
as
his
eye
meet
his
sister
's
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
this
fashion
that
the
reconciliation
take
place
between
Squire
Vavasor
and
his
heir
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
Hospitality
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
winter
wear
itself
away
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
happy
as
he
be
amidst
the
sport
of
Norfolk
,
and
prosperous
as
he
may
be
with
the
augean
spoil
of
Oileymead
,
fret
himself
with
an
intense
anxiety
to
bring
to
a
close
<EOS>
that
affair
which
he
have
on
his
hand
with
the
widow
Greenow
.
<EOS>
there
be
two
special
danger
which
disturb
him
.
<EOS>
She
would
give
herself
and
all
her
money
to
that
adventurer
,
Bellfield
;
or
else
she
would
spend
her
own
money
so
fast
before
he
get
hold
upon
it
,
that
the
prize
would
be
greatly
damage
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
 
---
if
she
have
not
be
and
set
up
a
carriage
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
to
himself
one
day
,
as
stand
on
the
pavement
of
Tombland
,
in
Norwich
,
he
see
Mrs.
Greenow
issue
forth
from
the
close
in
a
private
brougham
,
accompany
by
one
of
the
Fairstairs
girl
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
be
and
set
up
her
carriage
as
sure
as
my
name
's
Cheesacre
!
"
  
<EOS>
whatever
reason
he
may
have
to
fear
the
former
danger
,
we
may
declare
that
he
have
none
whatever
as
to
the
latter
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
know
what
she
be
do
with
her
money
as
well
as
any
lady
in
England
.
<EOS>
the
private
carriage
be
only
a
hire
brougham
take
by
the
month
,
and
as
to
that
boy
in
button
whom
she
have
lately
establish
,
why
should
she
not
keep
a
young
servant
,
and
call
him
a
page
,
if
it
give
her
any
comfort
to
do
so
?
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Cheesacre
have
also
know
that
she
have
lend
the
Fairstairs
family
fifty
pound
to
help
them
through
with
some
difficulty
which
Joe
have
encounter
with
the
Norwich
tradespeople
,
he
would
have
be
beside
himself
with
dismay
.
<EOS>
He
desire
to
obtain
the
prize
unmutilated
,
 
in
all
its
fair
proportion
.
<EOS>
any
such
clipping
he
regard
as
robbery
against
himself
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
fear
Bellfield
more
than
he
fear
the
brougham
.
<EOS>
that
all
be
fair
in
love
and
war
be
no
doubt
,
at
this
period
,
Captain
Bellfield
's
maxim
,
and
we
can
only
trust
that
he
find
in
it
some
consolation
,
or
ease
to
his
conscience
,
in
regard
to
the
monstrous
lie
which
he
tell
his
friend
.
<EOS>
in
war
,
no
doubt
,
all
stratagem
be
fair
.
<EOS>
the
one
general
be
quite
justified
in
make
the
other
believe
that
he
be
far
to
the
right
,
when
in
truth
he
be
turn
his
enemy
's
left
flank
.
<EOS>
if
successful
,
he
will
be
put
upon
a
pedestal
for
his
clever
deceit
,
and
crown
with
laurel
because
of
his
lie
.
<EOS>
if
Bellfield
could
only
be
successful
,
and
achieve
for
himself
the
mastery
over
those
forty
thousand
pound
,
the
world
would
forgive
him
and
place
,
on
his
brow
also
,
some
not
uncomfortable
crown
.
<EOS>
in
the
mean
time
,
his
stratagem
be
as
deep
and
his
lie
as
profound
as
those
of
any
general
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
suppose
that
Cheesacre
ever
believe
him
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
he
know
that
Bellfield
be
not
a
man
to
be
believe
in
any
way
.
<EOS>
have
he
not
be
live
on
lie
for
the
last
ten
year
?
<EOS>
but
then
a
man
may
lie
in
such
a
way
as
to
deceive
,
though
no
one
believe
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
be
keep
in
an
agony
of
doubt
while
Captain
Bellfield
occupy
his
lodging
in
Norwich
.
<EOS>
He
fee'd
Jeannette
liberally
.
<EOS>
He
even
fee'd
Charlie
Fairstairs
,
 
Miss
Fairstairs
<EOS>
I
mean
,
 
with
glove
,
and
chicken
from
Oileymead
,
so
that
he
may
know
whether
that
kite
flutter
about
his
dovecoat
,
and
of
what
nature
be
the
fluttering
.
<EOS>
He
go
even
further
than
this
,
and
fee'd
the
Captain
himself
,
 
bind
him
down
not
to
flutter
as
value
give
in
return
for
such
fee
.
<EOS>
He
attempt
even
to
fee
the
widow
,
 
caution
her
against
the
fluttering
,
as
he
tender
to
her
,
on
his
knee
,
a
brooch
as
big
as
a
breast
-
plate
.
<EOS>
She
wave
aside
the
breast
-
plate
,
declare
that
the
mourning
ring
which
contain
poor
Greenow
's
final
grey
lock
of
hair
,
be
the
last
article
from
a
jeweller
's
shop
which
should
ever
find
a
place
about
her
person
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
she
declare
that
Captain
Bellfield
be
nothing
to
her
;
Mr.
Cheesacre
nee
have
no
fear
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
she
add
,
neither
be
he
to
have
any
hope
.
<EOS>
Her
affection
be
all
bury
under
the
cold
sod
.
<EOS>
this
be
harass
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
though
no
absolute
satisfaction
be
to
be
attain
in
the
wooing
of
Mrs.
Greenow
,
there
be
a
pleasantness
in
the
occupation
which
ought
to
have
reconcile
her
suitor
to
their
destiny
.
<EOS>
with
most
lady
,
when
a
gentleman
have
be
on
his
knee
before
one
of
them
in
the
morning
,
with
outspoken
protestation
of
love
,
with
clearly
define
proffer
of
marriage
,
with
a
minute
inventory
of
the
offerer
's
worldly
wealth
,
 
down
even
to
the
"
mahogany
-
furniture
"
bed
-
chamber
,
as
be
the
case
with
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
and
when
all
these
overture
have
be
peremptorily
decline
,
 
a
gentleman
in
such
a
case
,
I
say
,
would
generally
feel
some
awkwardness
in
sit
down
to
tea
with
the
lady
at
the
close
of
such
a
performance
.
<EOS>
but
with
Mrs.
Greenow
there
be
no
such
awkwardness
.
<EOS>
after
an
hour
's
work
of
the
nature
above
describe
she
would
play
the
hostess
with
a
genial
hospitality
,
that
ease
off
all
the
annoyance
of
disappointment
;
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
evening
,
she
would
accept
a
squeeze
of
the
hand
,
a
good
,
palpable
,
long
-
protract
squeeze
,
with
that
sort
of
"
do
not
;
 
have
do
now
,
"
by
which
irish
young
lady
allure
their
lover
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
on
such
occasion
,
would
leave
the
close
,
swear
that
she
should
be
his
on
the
next
market
-
day
,
 
or
at
any
rate
,
on
the
next
Saturday
.
<EOS>
then
,
on
the
Monday
,
tiding
would
reach
him
that
Bellfield
have
pass
all
Sunday
afternoon
with
his
lady
-
love
,
 
Bellfield
,
to
whom
he
have
lend
five
pound
on
purpose
that
he
may
be
enable
to
spend
that
very
Sunday
with
some
officer
of
the
Suffolk
volunteer
at
Ipswich
.
<EOS>
and
hear
this
,
he
would
walk
out
among
those
rich
heap
,
at
the
back
of
his
farmyard
,
utter
deep
curse
against
the
falsehood
of
man
and
the
fickleness
of
woman
.
  
<EOS>
drive
to
despair
,
he
at
last
resolve
to
ask
Bellfield
to
come
to
Oileymead
for
a
month
.
<EOS>
that
drilling
at
Norwich
,
or
the
part
of
it
which
be
suppose
to
be
profitable
,
be
wear
itself
out
.
<EOS>
fund
be
low
with
the
Captain
,
 
as
he
do
not
scruple
to
tell
his
friend
Cheesacre
,
and
he
accept
the
invitation
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
mount
you
with
the
harrier
,
old
fellow
,
"
Cheesacre
have
say
;
"
and
give
you
a
little
shooting
.
<EOS>
only
I
will
not
have
you
go
out
when
I
be
not
with
you
.
"
<EOS>
Bellfield
agree
,
each
of
them
understand
the
nature
of
the
bargain
;
though
Bellfield
,
I
think
,
have
somewhat
the
clear
understanding
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
be
so
near
the
widow
as
he
have
be
at
Norwich
,
but
he
would
not
be
less
near
than
his
kind
host
.
<EOS>
and
his
host
would
no
doubt
watch
him
closely
;
 
but
then
he
also
could
watch
his
host
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
railway
station
not
two
mile
from
Oileymead
,
and
the
journey
thence
into
Norwich
be
one
of
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
would
doubtless
be
very
jealous
of
such
journey
,
but
with
all
his
jealousy
he
could
not
prevent
them
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
in
regard
to
this
arrangement
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
pay
the
piper
,
whereas
Captain
Bellfield
pay
nothing
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
sweet
to
him
if
he
could
carry
off
his
friend
's
prize
from
under
the
very
eave
of
his
friend
's
house
?
  
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Greenow
also
understand
the
arrangement
.
<EOS>
"
go
to
Oileymead
;
be
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
say
when
Captain
Bellfield
come
to
tell
her
of
his
departure
.
<EOS>
Charlie
Fairstairs
be
with
her
,
so
that
the
Captain
could
not
utilize
the
moment
in
any
special
way
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
quite
delightful
,
"
continue
the
widow
,
"
to
see
how
fond
you
two
gentleman
be
of
each

Charlie

pende
the

go
out

He
know
the
way

be

find
himself
leave
alone

he
much
surprised
when
he
learn
that
he
be
not
put
into
one
of

mahogany

chamber
,

into
a
back
room
look
over
the
farm

yard
in
which
there
be
no

<EOS>
the
Captain
have
already
endure
some
of
the
evil
of
poverty

could
have
put
up
with
this
easily
have
nothing

as
it

Cheesacre
bring

sulkily

"
of

you
will
do
very
well

It
be
the
warm
room
in

in
one
way

He
do
not
say
in
what
way
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
near
neighbourhood
of
the
stable
may
have
have
a
warming
effect
.
  
<EOS>
Bellfield
do
not
like
it
;
but
what
be
a
poor
man
to
do
under
such
circumstance
?
<EOS>
so
he
go
up
-
stair
and
wash
his
hand
before
dinner
in
the
room
without
a
fire
-
place
,
flatter
himself
that
he
would
yet
be
even
with
his
friend
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
They
dine
together
not
in
the
good
humour
,
and
after
dinner
they
sit
down
to
enjoy
themselves
with
pipe
and
brandy
and
water
.
<EOS>
Bellfield
,
have
a
taste
for
everything
that
be
expensive
,
would
have
prefer
cigar
;
but
his
friend
put
none
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
though
he
could
spend
his
money
liberally
when
occasion
require
such
spending
,
know
well
the
value
of
domestic
economy
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
go
to
put
himself
out
,
as
he
call
it
,
for
Bellfield
!
<EOS>
what
be
good
enough
for
himself
be
good
enough
for
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
beggar
,
you
know
;
just
a
regular
beggar
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
he
be
betray
into
say
to
Mrs.
Greenow
on
some
occasion
just
at
this
period
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
He
only
want
money
to
make
him
almost
perfect
,
"
Mrs.
Greenow
have
answer
;
 
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
have
feel
that
he
have
make
a
mistake
.
  
<EOS>
both
the
man
become
talkative
,
if
not
good
-
humour
,
under
the
effect
of
the
brandy
and
water
,
and
the
Captain
then
communicate
Mrs.
Greenow
's
invitation
to
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
He
have
have
his
doubt
as
to
the
propriety
of
do
so
,
 
think
that
perhaps
it
may
be
to
his
advantage
to
forget
the
message
.
<EOS>
but
he
reflect
that
he
be
at
any
rate
a
match
for
Cheesacre
when
they
be
present
together
,
and
finally
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
message
should
be
deliver
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
to
go
and
just
wish
her
goodbye
you
know
,
"
he
say
apologetically
,
as
he
finish
his
little
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
that
at
all
,
"
say
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
my
dear
fellow
,
how
foolishly
jealous
you
be
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
to
be
downright
uncivil
to
her
,
as
you
would
have
me
be
,
it
would
only
call
attention
to
the
thing

I
be
not

I
do

have
to
do
with
it

we
will
let
that
pass

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
have
a
great
deal
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
if
a
man
do
intend
to
marry
he
ought
to
have
thing
comfortable
about
him
;
unless
he
want
to
live
on
his

I
look
upon
as
about
the
mean

a

can
do

by
George

I
would
sooner
break
stone

that

<EOS>
this
be
hard
for
any

to
bear
,
 
even
for
Captain
Bellfield

he
do
bear
it

look
forward
to
revenge

there
be
no
please
you

know

he
.

"

there
be
the
fact
.
<EOS>
I
go
to
say
goodbye
to
her
,

she
ask
me
to
give
you
that
message
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
go

"
  
<EOS>
Cheesacre
sit
for
some
time
silent
,
blow
out
huge
cloud
of
smoke
while
he
meditate
a
little
plan

I
will
tell

will
go

Mrs.

shall
get
you
anything
you

I
will
stand
you

Captain
Bellfield
be
not

put
up
with
this

not

altogether
to
work

before

hide
it
away

not

<EOS>
how
you

hack
that
ham

he

if
you

you
would

in

<EOS>
"
this
be
very
bad

<EOS>
even
Bellfield
could
not
bear
it
with
equanimity
,
and
feel
unable
to
eat
the
ham
under
such
circumstance
,
make
his
breakfast
with
a
couple
of
fresh
egg

<EOS>
"
if
you

why
the
mischief
do
you
cut
it

Cheesacre

<EOS>
"
upon
my

,
Cheesacre

you
be

bad

who
want
your

You

<EOS>
"
no
I
do
not

anything

either
that
you

<EOS>
It
be
not
fair
to
ask
a
fellow
into
your
house
,
and
then
say
such
thing
to
him
as
that
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
not
what
I
have
be
accustom

either

I
can
tell
you
that

Mr.

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
bother
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
very
well
to
say
bother

I
choose
to
be
treat
like
a
gentleman
wherever
I
go

<EOS>
You

I
have
know
each
other
a
long
time

I
would
put
up

"
Can
you
pay
me
the
money
that
you
owe
me

Bellfield

"
say
Cheesacre
,
look
hard
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
can
not

"
say
Bellfield
;
"
not
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
eat
your
breakfast
,

hold
your

"
  
<EOS>
after
that
Captain
Bellfield
do
eat
his
breakfast
,
 
leave
the
ham
however
untouched
,
and
do
hold
his
tongue
,
vow
vengeance
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
but
the
two
man
go
into
Norwich
more
amicably
together
than
they
would
have
do
<EOS>
have
there
be
no
word
between

<EOS>
Cheesacre
feel
that
he
have
trespass
a
little
,
and
therefore
offer
the
Captain
a
cigar
as
he
seat
himself
in
the
cart
.
<EOS>
Bellfield
accept
the
offering
,
and
smoke
the
weed

peace

<EOS>
"
now

"

Cheesacre
,
as
he
drive
into

all

<EOS>

all
right

mind
this

Bellfield

"
  
<EOS>
in
this
instance
Captain
Bellfield
have
no
intention
to
deceive
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
think
it
probable
that
he
could
do
himself
any
good
by
philander
about
the
widow
early
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
engage
with
her
dinner
and
with
an
early
toilet
.
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
,
moreover
,
have
learn
from
experience
that
the
first
comer
have
not
always
an
advantage
in
lady
"
society
.
<EOS>
the
mind
of
a
woman
be
greedy
after
novelty
,
and
it
be
upon
the
stranger
,
or
upon
the
most
strange
of
her
slave
around
her

that
she
often
smile
the
sweetest

<EOS>
the
cathedral
clock
,
therefore
,
have
strike
four
before
Captain
Bellfield
ring
Mrs.
Greenow
's
bell
,
and
then
,
when
he
be
show
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
he
find
Cheesacre
there
alone
,
redolent
with
the
marrow
oil
,
and
beautiful
with
the
pink
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
not
you
see
her
yet
?
"
ask
the
Captain
almost
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
no

Cheesacre
sulkily
.
  
<EOS>
"
nor
yet
Charlie
Fairstairs

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
nobody
,
"
say
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
but
at
this
moment
he
be
compel
to
swallow
his
anger
,
as
Mrs.
Greenow
,
accompany
by
her
lady
guest
,
come
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
whoever
would
have
expect
two
gentleman
to
be
so
punctual
,
"
say
she
,
"
especially
on
market

day
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
market
-
day
make
no
difference
when
I
come
to
see
you
,
"
say
Cheesacre
,
put
his
good
foot
forward
,
while
Captain
Bellfield
content
himself
with
say
something
civil
to
Charlie
.
<EOS>
He
would
bide
his
time
and
ride
a
wait
race
.
  
<EOS>
the
widow
be
almost
gorgeous
in
her
weed
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
she
have
not
sin
in
her
dress
against
any
of
those
canon
which
the
semi
-
ecclesiastical
authority
on
widowhood
have
lay
down
as
to
the
outward
garment
fit
for
gentleman
's
relict
.
<EOS>
the
material
be
those
which
be
devoted
to
the
deep
conjugal
grief
.
<EOS>
as
regard
every
item
of
the
write
law
her
suttee
worship
be
carry
out
to
the
letter
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
widow
's
cap
,
generally
so
hideous
,
so
well
known
to
the
eye
of
all
man
,
so
odious
to
womanhood
.
<EOS>
let
us
hope
that
such
headgear
may
have
some
assuage
effect
on
the
depart
spirit
of
husband
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
dress
of
deep
,
cling
,
melancholy
crape
,
 
of
crape
which
become
so
brown
and
so
rusty
,
and
which
make
the
six
month
"
widow
seem
so
much
more
afflict
a
creature
than
she
whose
husband
be
just
go
,
and
whose
crape
be
therefore
new
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
trail
weeper
,
and
the
widow
's
kerchief
pin
close
round
her
neck
and
somewhat
tightly
over
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
that
of
genius
about
Mrs.
Greenow
,
that
she
have
turn
every
seeming
disadvantage
to
some
special
profit
,
and
have
so
dress
herself
that
though
she
have
obey
the
law
to
the
letter
,
she
have
throw
the
spirit
of
it
to
the
wind
.
<EOS>
Her
cap
sit
jauntily
on
her
head
,
and
show
just
so
much
of
her
rich
brown
hair
as
to
give
her
the
appearance
of
youth
which
she
desire
.
<EOS>
Cheesacre
have
blame
her
in
his
heart
for
her
private
carriage
,
but
she
spend
more
money
,
I
think
,
on
new
crape
than
she
do
on
her
brougham
.
<EOS>
It
never
become
brown
and
rusty
with
her
,
or
form
itself
into
old
lumpy
fold
,
or
shape
itself
round
her
like
a
grave
cloth
.
<EOS>
the
write
law
have
not
interdict
crinoline
,
and
she
loom
as
large
with
weed
,
which
with
her
be
not
sombre
,
as
she
would
do
with
her
silk
when
the
period
of
her
probation
should
be
over
.
<EOS>
Her
weeper
be
bright
with
newness
,
and
she
would
waft
them
aside
from
her
shoulder
with
an
air
which
turn
even
them
into
auxiliary
.
<EOS>
Her
kerchief
be
fasten
close
round
her
neck
and
close
over
her
bosom
;
but
Jeannette
well
know
what
she
be
do
as
she
fasten
it
,
 
and
so
do
Jeannette
's
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
would
still
talk
much
about
her
husband
,
declare
that
her
loss
be
as
fresh
to
her
wounded
heart
,
as
though
he
,
on
whom
all
her
happiness
have
rest
,
have
leave
her
only
yesterday
;
but
yet
she
mistake
her
date
,
frequently
refer
to
the
melancholy
circumstance
,
as
have
take
place
fifteen
month
ago
.
<EOS>
in
truth
,
however
,
Mr.
Greenow
have
be
alive
within
the
last
nine
month
,
 
as
everybody
around
her
knew
.
<EOS>
but
if
she
choose
to
forget
the
exact
day
,
why
should
her
friend
or
dependent
remind
her
of
it
?
<EOS>
no
friend
or
dependent
do
remind
her
of
it
,
and
Charlie
Fairstairs
speak
of
the
fifteen
month
with
bold
confidence
,
 
<EOS>
false
-
tongued
little
parasite
that
she
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
look
well
,
"
say
the
widow
,
in
answer
to
some
outspoken
compliment
from
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
be
well
enough
in
health
,
and
I
suppose
I
ought
to
be
thankful
that
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
have
bury
a
wife
whom
you
have
love
within
the
last
eighteen
month
,
you
would
have
become
as
indifferent
as
I
be
to
all
that
kind
of
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
be
married
yet
,
"
say
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
therefore
you
know
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
everything
in
the
world
be
gay
and
fresh
to
you
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
you
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
I
would
not
run
the
risk
.
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
worth
a
woman
's
while
,
and
I
suppose
not
a
man
's
.
<EOS>
the
suffering
be
too
great
!
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
she
press
her
handkerchief
to
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
mean
to
try
all
the
same
,
"
say
Cheesacre
,
look
the
lover
all
over
as
he
gaze
into
the
fair
one
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
that
you
may
be
successful
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
and
that
she
may
not
be
tear
away
from
you
early
in
life

<EOS>
be
dinner
ready

Jeannette

<EOS>
that
be
well
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
will
you
give
your
arm
to
Miss
Fairstairs
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
as
to
Mrs.
Greenow
's
correctness
.
<EOS>
as
Captain
Bellfield
hold
,
or
have
hold
,
her
Majesty
's
commission
,
he
be
clearly
entitled
to
take
the
mistress
of
the
festival
down
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
but
Cheesacre
would
not
look
at
it
in
this
light
.
<EOS>
He
would
only
remember
that
he
have
pay
for
the
Captain
's
food
for
some
time
past
,
that
the
Captain
have
be
bring
into
Norwich
in
his
gig
,
that
the
Captain
owe
him
money
,
and
ought
,
so
to
say
,
to
be
regard
as
his
property
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
I
pay
my
way
,
and
that
ought
to
give
a
man
high
station
than
be
a
beggarly
captain
,
 
which
I
do
not
believe
he
be
,
if
all
the
truth
be
know
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
thus
that
he
take
an
occasion
to
express
himself
to
Miss
Fairstairs
on
that
very
evening
.
"
<EOS>
military
rank

,
"
Miss
Fairstairs
have
reply
,
take
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
remark
as
a
direct
slight
upon
herself
.
<EOS>
He
have
take
her
down
to
dinner
,
and
have
then
come
to
her
complaining
that
he
have
be
injure
in
be
call
upon
to
do
so
!
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
a
magistrate
,
Mr.

,
you
would
have
rank

but
I
believe
you
be
not

"
<EOS>
Charlie
Fairstairs
know
well
what
she
be
about
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
have
strive
much
to
get
his
name
put
upon
the
commission
of

but
have
fail

scraggy
old

Cheesacre
say
to
himself
,
as
he
turn
away
from
her

<EOS>
but
Bellfield
gain
little
by
take
the
widow
down
.
<EOS>
He
and
Cheesacre
be
place
at
the
top
and
bottom
of
the
table
,
so
that
they
may
do
the
work
of

<EOS>
Mrs.

Jeannette
wait
at

nimbly

Mrs.

far
repressed
for

all
remembrance
of

enable

<EOS>
under

often

of

yard

on
drink
his

comfortably

seem
to
be
chuckle
with
glee

Cheesacre
be
so
astounded

so
lose

that
the

bribe
with

not

his

It

him
immediately

she
make
up
her
mind

cut
fatally

survivor

as
it
do
so
the
Captain
look
up

triumph

grey

looking

insignificant
old

mouth

another
widow

even
if

have
keep

over
silently

would
have
be
ashamed

show
it

<EOS>
have
you
ever
see
it

ask
Mrs.
Greenow

<EOS>
"
It
be
so
like
him

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
at
Yarmouth

very
sulkily
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
you
do
not
,
"
say
the
lady
with
some
dignity
,
and
not
a
little
of
rebuke
in
her
tone
;
"
simply
because
it
never
be
at
Yarmouth
.
<EOS>
a
large
one
you
may
have
see
,
which
I
always
keep
,
and
always
shall
keep
,
close
by
my
bedside

"
  
<EOS>
"
not
if
I
know
it
,
"
say
Captain
Bellfield
to
himself
.
<EOS>
then
the
widow
punish
Mr.
Cheesacre
for
his
sullenness
by
whisper
a
few
word
to
the
captain
;
and
Cheesacre
in
his
wrath
turn
to
Charlie
Fairstairs
.
<EOS>
then
it
be
that
he
spake
out
his
mind
about
the
Captain
's
rank
,
and
be
snub
by
Charlie
,
 
as
be
tell
a
page
or
two
back
.
  
<EOS>
after
that
,
coffee
be
bring
to
them
,
and
here
again
Cheesacre
in
his
ill
-
humour
allow
the
Captain
to
out
-
manoeuvre
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
Captain
who
put
the
sugar
into
the
cup
and
hand
them
round
.
<EOS>
He
even
hand
a
cup
to
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
"
none
for
me
,
Captain
Bellfield
;
many
thank
for
your
politeness
all
the
same
,
"
say
Mr.
Cheesacre
;
and
Mrs.
Greenow
know
from
the
tone
of
his
voice
that
there
have
be
a
quarrel
.
  
<EOS>
cheesacre
sit
then
in
his
gloom
,
have
resolve
upon
one
thing
,
 
or
,
I
may
perhaps
say
,
upon
two
thing
.
<EOS>
He
have
resolve
that
he
would
not
leave
the
room
that
evening
till
Bellfield
have
leave
it
;
and
that
he
would
get
a
final
answer
from
the
widow
,
if
not
that
night
,
 
for
he
think
it
very
possible
that
they
may
both
be
send
away
together
,
 
then
early
after
breakfast
on
the
following
morning
.
<EOS>
for
the
present
,
he
have
give
up
any
idea
of
turn
his
time
to
good
account
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
perhaps
a
coward
,
but
he
have
not
that
special
courage
which
enable
a
man
to
fight
well
under
adverse
circumstance
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
cow
by
the
unexpected
impertinence
of
his
rival
,
 
by
the
insolence
of
a
man
to
whom
he
think
that
he
have
obtain
the
power
of
be
always
himself
as
insolent
as
he
please
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
recover
his
ground
quickly
,
or
carry
himself
before
his
lady
's
eye
as
though
he
be
unconscious
of
the
wound
he
have
receive
.
<EOS>
so
he
sit
silent
,
while
Bellfield
be
discourse
fluently
.
<EOS>
He
sit
in
silence
,
comfort
himself
with
reflection
on
his
own
wealth
,
and
on
the
poverty
of
the
other
,
and
promise
himself
a
rich
harvest
of
revenge
when
the
moment
should
come
in
which
he
may
tell
Mrs.
Greenow
how
absolutely
that
man
be
a
beggar
,
a
swindler
,
and
a
rascal
.
  
<EOS>
and
he
be
astonish
when
an
opportunity
for
do
so
come
very
quickly
.
<EOS>
before
the
neighbour
clock
have
do
strike
seven
,
Bellfield
rise
from
his
chair
to
go
.
<EOS>
He
first
of
all
speak
a
word
of
farewell
to
Miss
Fairstairs
;
then
he
turn
to
his
late
host
;
"
good
night
,
Cheesacre
,
"
he
say
,
in
the
easy
tone
in
the
world
;
after
that
he
press
the
widow
's
hand
and
whisper
his
adieu
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
be
stay
at
Oileymead
?
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
come
from
there
this
morning
,
"
say
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
he
be
not
go
back
there
,
I
can
tell
you
,
"
say
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
indeed
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
;
"
I
hope
there
be
nothing
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
all
as
right
as
a
trivet
,

say
the
Captain
;
and
then
he
be
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
promise
mamma
that
I
would
be
home
by
seven
,
"
say
Charlie
Fairstairs
,
rise
from
her
chair
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
suppose
that
she
have
any
wish
to
oblige
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
and
therefore
this
movement
on
her
part
must
be
regard
simply
as
do
in
kindness
to
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
She
may
be
mistake
in
supposing
that
Mrs.
Greenow
would
desire
to
be
leave
alone
with
Mr.
Cheesacre
;
but
it
be
clear
to
her
that
in
this
way
she
could
give
no
offence
,
whereas
it
be
quite
possible
that
she
may
offend
by
remain
.
<EOS>
a
little
after
seven
Mr.
Cheesacre
find
himself
alone
with
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
to
find
,
"
say
she
,
gravely
,
"
that
you
two
have
quarrel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
say
he
,
jump
up
,
and
become
on
a
sudden
full
of
life

that
man
be
a
downright
swindler

<EOS>
"
He
be

<EOS>
He
will
tell
you
that

I
believe

prison
all
the
time

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Captain
have
be
arrest
,
I
think
twice
,
and
thus
Mr.
Cheesacre
justify
to
himself
this
assertion

<EOS>
"
I
doubt
whether
he
ever

fire

he
continue

<EOS>
"
He
be
none
the
bad
for
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
he
tell
such
lie
;
and
then
he
have
not
a
penny
in
the
world

<EOS>
how
much
do
you
suppose
he
owe
me
,
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
however
much
it
be
,
I
be
sure
you
be
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
well
;
 
yes
,
I
be
,
"
say
he
,
try
to
recover
himself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
when
I
ask
him
how
he
intend
to
pay
me
,
what
do
you
think

<EOS>
He
say

then

<EOS>
the
poor

be
dreadfully
crestfallen

so
much
so

as

drive
himself
home

console
himself
by
think
of
the
miserable
plight
in
which
Bellfield
would
find
himself
at
Norwich
,
with
no
possession

what
he
have
bring
into

town
that
day
in
a
small
bag

as
he
turn
in

Noble

<EOS>
George
Vavasor
remain
about
four
day
beneath
his
grandfather
's
roof
;
but
he
be
not
happy
there
himself
,
nor
do
he
contribute
to
the
happiness
of
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
He
remain
there
in
great
discomfort
so
long
,
be
unwilling
to
leave
till
an
answer
have
be
receive
to
the
request
make
to
Aunt
Greenow

in
order
that
he
may
insist
on
Kate
's
performance
of
her
promise
with
reference
to
Alice

if
that
answer

be
unfavourable

during

five
day
Kate
do
all
in
her
power
to
induce
her
brother
to
be
,
at
any
rate
,
kind
in
his
manner
towards
his
grandfather
,
but
it
be
in
vain
.
<EOS>
the
Squire
would
not
be
the
first
to
be
gracious
;
and
George
,
quite
as
obstinate
as
the
old
man
,
would
take
no
step
in
that
direction
till
encourage
to
do
so
by
graciousness
from
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
poor
Kate
entreat
each
of
them
to
begin

her
entreaty
be
of
no

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
an
ill

mannered
cub

him
into

do
not
mention
his
name
to
me
again
.

<EOS>
George
argue
the
matter
more
at
length
.
<EOS>
Kate
speak
to
him
of
his
own
interest
in
the
matter
,
urge
upon
him
that
he
may
,
by
such
conduct
,
drive
the
Squire
to
exclude
him
altogether
from
the
property
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
must
do
as
he
like
,
"
George

sulkily

<EOS>
"
but
for
Alice
's
sake
!
"
<EOS>
Kate
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
would
be
the
last
to
expect
me
to
submit
to
unreasonable
ill
-
usage
for
the
sake
of
money
.
<EOS>
as
regard
myself
,
I
confess
that
I
be
very
fond
of
money
and
be
not
particularly
squeamish
.
<EOS>
I
would
do
anything
that
a
man
can
do
to
secure
it
.
<EOS>
but
this
I
can
not
do
.
<EOS>
I
never
injure
him
,
and
I
never
ask
him
to
injure
himself
.
<EOS>
I
never
attempt
to
borrow
money
from
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
cost
him
a
shilling
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
in
the
wine
business
he
may
have
enable
me
to
make
a
large
fortune
simply
by
settle
on
me
then
the
reversion
of
property
which
,
when
he
die
,
ought
to
be
my
own
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
perversely
ignorant
that
he
would
make
no
inquiry
,
but
choose
to
think
that
I
be
ruin
myself
,
at
the
only
time
of
my
life
when
I
be
really
do
well

he

a
right

act

he

urge
Kate

certainly
he
have
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
no
right
to
resent
my
asking
such
a
favour
at
his
hand

<EOS>
He
be
an
ignorant
old
fool
not

do
it

I
should
never
have
quarrel
with
him
on
that
account

<EOS>
nature
make
him
a
fool

it
be
not
his
fault

but
I
can
not
bring
myself
to
kneel
in

dirt
before
him

because
I
ask
for
what
be
reasonable

<EOS>
the
two
man
say
very
little
to
each

They
be
never
alone
together
except
during
that
half
-
hour
after
dinner
in
which
they
be
suppose
to
drink
their
wine

<EOS>
the
old
Squire
always
take
three
glass
of
port
during
this
period
,
and
expect
that
his
grandson
would
take
three
with
him

<EOS>

George
would
drink
none
at
all

<EOS>
"
I
have

that
you

nothing

claret

the
Squire
,
in
a
tone
of
voice
that
be
certainly
not
conciliatory

<EOS>
"
I
mean
simply
what
I
say
,
"
say
George
 
"
that
I
have
give
up
drink
wine
after
dinner

<EOS>
"
the
old
man
could
not
openly
quarrel
with
his
heir
on
such
a
point
as
that
.
<EOS>
even
Mr.
Vavasor
could
not
tell
his
grandson
that
he
be
go
to
the
dog
because
he
have
become
temperate

but
,
nevertheless
,
there
be
offence
in
it

when
George
sit
perfectly
silent

look
at
the
fire
,
evidently
determine
to
make
no
attempt
at
conversation

the
offence

"
what

from
all
which

all
that

I
shall
know

well
what
to

<EOS>
of
course
she
do
not
persist
in
her
refusal
.
<EOS>
with
a
sorrowful
heart
,
and
with
finger
that
could
hardly
form
the
needful
letter
,
she
do
write
a
letter
to
her
cousin
,
which
explain
the
fact
 
that
George
Vavasor
immediately
want
a
thousand
pound
for
his
electioneer
purpose
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
stiff
,
uncomfortable
letter
,
unnatural
in
its
phraseology
,
tell
its
own
tale
of
grief
and
shame
.
<EOS>
Alice
understand
very
plainly
all
the
circumstance
under
which
it
be
write
,
but
she
send
back
word
to
Kate
at
once
,
undertake
that
the
money
should
be
forthcoming
;
and
she
write
again
before
the
end
of
January
,
say
that
the
sum
name
have
be
pay
to
George
's
credit
at
his
own
banker
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
have
take
immense
pride
in
the
renewal
of
the
match
between
her
brother
and
her
cousin
,
and
have
rejoice
in
it
greatly
as
be
her
own
work
.
<EOS>
but
all
that
pride
and
joy
be
now
over
.
<EOS>
She
could
no
longer
write
triumphant
note
to
Alice
,
speak
always
of
George
as
one
who
be
to
be
their
joint
hero
,
foretell
great
thing
of
his
career
in
Parliament
,
and
say
little
soft
thing
of
his
endure
love
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
longer
possible
to
her
now
to
write
of
George
at
all
,
and
it
be
equally
impossible
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
no
letter
pass
between
them
,
when
that
monetary
correspondence
be
over
,
up
to
the
end
of
the
winter
.
<EOS>
Kate
remain
down
in
Westmoreland
,
wretched
and
ill
at
ease
,
listen
to
hard
word
speak
by
her
grandfather
against
her
brother
,
and
feel
herself
unable
to
take
her
brother
's
part
as
she
have
be
will
not
to
do
in
other
time
.
  
<EOS>
George
return
to
town
at
the
end
of
those
four
day
,
and
find
that
the
thousand
pound
be
duly
place
to
his
credit
before
the
end
of
the
month
.
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
necessary
to
tell
the
reader
that
this
money
have
come
from
the
store
of
Mr.
Tombe
,
and
that
Mr.
Tombe
duly
debit
Mr.
Grey
with
the
amount
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
in
accordance
with
her
promise
,
have
tell
her
father
that
the
money
be
need
,
and
her
father
,
in
accordance
with
his
promise
,
have
procure
it
without
a
word
of
remonstrance
.
<EOS>
"
surely
I
must
sign
some
paper
,
"
Alice
have
say
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
be
content
when
her
father
tell
her
that
the
lawyer
would
manage
all
that
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
nearly
the
end
of
February
when
George
Vavasor
make
his
first
payment
to
Mr.
Scruby
on
behalf
of
the
come
election
;
and
when
he
call
at
Mr.
Scruby
's
office
with
this
object
,
he
receive
some
intelligence
which
surprise
him
not
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
hear
the
news
,
"
say
Scruby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
news
?
<EOS>
"
say
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
Marquis
be
as
nearly
off
the
hook
as
a
man
can
be
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
,
as
he
communicate
the
tiding
,
show
clearly
by
his
face
and
voice
that
they
be
suppose
to
be
of
very
great
importance
;
but
Vavasor
do
not
at
first
seem
to
be
as
much
interested
in
the
fate
of
"
the
Marquis
"
as
Scruby
have
intend
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
sorry
for
him
,
"
say
George
.
<EOS>
"
who
be
the
Marquis
?
<EOS>
there
will
be
sure
to
come
another
,
so
it
do
not
much
signify
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
will
come
another
,
and
that
be
just
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
Marquis
of
Bunratty
;
and
if
he
drop
,
our
young
Member
will
go
into
the
Upper
House
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
,
immediately
;
before
the
end
of
the
Session
?
"
<EOS>
George
,
of
course
,
know
well
enough
that
such
would
be
the
case
,
but
the
effect
which
this
event
would
have
upon
himself
now
strike
him
suddenly
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
,
"
say
Scruby
.
<EOS>
"
the
writ
would
be
out
immediately
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
enough
of
it
,
only
that
I
know
that
Travers
's
people
have
hear
of
it
before
us
,
and
that
they
be
ready
to
be
up
with
their
poster
<EOS>
directly
the
breath
be
out
of
the
Marquis
's
body
.
<EOS>
We
must
go
to
work
immediately
;
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
only
be
for
part
of
a
Session
,
"
say
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
just
so
,
"
say
Mr.
Scruby
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
then
there
will
be
the
cost
of
another
election
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
true
,
"
say
Mr.
Scruby
;
"
but
in
such
case
we
do
manage
to
make
it
come
a
little
cheap
.
<EOS>
if
you
lick
traver
now
,
it
may
be
that
you
will
have
a
walk
-
over
for
the
next
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
see
grime
?
"
ask
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
have
;
the
blackguard
!
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
open
his
house
on
Travers
's
side
.
<EOS>
He
come
to
me
as
bold
as
brass
,
and
tell
me
so
,
say
that
he
never
like
gentleman
who
keep
him
wait
for
his
odd
money
.
<EOS>
what
anger
me
be
that
he
ever
get
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
not
manage
it
very
well
,
certainly
,
"
say
Vavasor
,
look
nastily
at
the
attorney
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
not
help
those
little
accident
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
there
be
bad
accident
than
that
turn
up
almost
daily
in
my
business
.
<EOS>
You
may
think
yourself
almost
lucky
that
I
have
not
go
over
to
Travers
myself
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
Liberal
,
you
know
;
and
it
have
not
be
for
want
of
an
offer
,
I
can
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
be
incline
to
doubt
the
extent
of
his
luck
in
this
respect
,
and
be
almost
disposed
to
repent
of
his
Parliamentary
ambition
.
<EOS>
He
would
now
be
call
upon
to
spend
certainly
not
less
than
three
thousand
pound
of
his
cousin
's
money
on
the
chance
of
be
able
to
sit
in
Parliament
for
a
few
month
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
after
what
a
fashion
would
he
be
compel
to
negotiate
that
loan
!
<EOS>
He
may
,
to
be
sure
,
allow
the
remainder
of
this
session
to
run
,
and
stand
,
as
he
have
intend
,
at
the
general
election
;
but
he
know
that
if
he
now
allow
a
Liberal
to
win
the
seat
,
the
holder
of
the
seat
would
be
almost
sure
of
subsequent
success
.
<EOS>
He
must
either
fight
now
,
or
give
up
the
fight
altogether
;
and
he
be
a
man
who
do
not
love
to
abandon
any
contest
in
which
he
have
be
engage
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Squire
,
"
say
Scruby
,
"
how
be
it
to
be
?
"
<EOS>
and
Vavasor
feel
that
he
detect
in
the
man
's
voice
some
diminution
of
that
respect
with
which
he
have
hitherto
be
treat
as
a
pay
candidate
for
a
metropolitan
borough
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
lord
be
not
dead
yet
,
"
say
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
he
be
not
dead
yet
,
that
we
have
hear
;
but
it
will
not
do
for
us
to
wait
.
<EOS>
We
want
every
minute
of
time
that
we
can
get
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
any
hope
for
him
,
I
be
tell
.
<EOS>
It
be
gout
in
the
stomach
,
or
dropsy
at
the
heart
,
or
some
of
those
thing
that
make
a
fellow
safe
to
go
.
<EOS>

<EOS>

It
will
not

for
the
next
election

"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
ask
me
,
I
should
say
certainly
not
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
should
not
wish
to
have
to
conduct
it
under
such
circumstance
.
<EOS>
I
hate
a
fight
when
there
be
no
chance
of
success
.
<EOS>
I
grudge
spend
a
man
's
money
in
such
a
case
;
I
do
indeed
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
Grimes
's
go
over
will
not
make
much
difference
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
the
blackguard
!
<EOS>
He
will
take
a
hundred
and
fifty
vote
,
I
suppose
;
perhaps
more
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
not
much
in
such
a
constituency
as
the
Chelsea
district
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
traver
play
<EOS>
mean
at
the
last
election
,
and
that
will
be
against
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
the
Conservatives
will
have
a
candidate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
knowing
;
but
I
do
not
think
they
will
.
<EOS>
They
will
try
one
at
the
general
,
no
doubt
;
but
if
the
two
sit
member
can
pull
together
,
they
will
not
have
much
of
a
chance
.
"
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
find
himself
compel
to
say
that
he
would
stand
;
and
scruby
undertake
to
give
the
initiatory
order
at
once
,
not
wait
even
till
the
Marquis
should
be
dead
.
<EOS>
"
We
should
have
our
house
open
as
soon
as
theirs
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
deal
in
that
.
"
<EOS>
so
George
Vavasor
give
his
order
.
<EOS>
"
if
the
bad
come
to
the
bad
,
"
he
say
to
himself
,
"
I
can
always
cut
my
throat
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
he
walk
from
the
attorney
's
office
to
his
club
he
bethink
himself
that
that
may
not
unprobably
be
the
necessary
termination
of
his
career
.
<EOS>
everything
be
go
wrong
with
him
.
<EOS>
His
grandfather
,
who
be
eighty
year
of
age
,
would
not
die
,
 
appear
to
have
no
symptom
of
die
;
 
whereas
this
Marquis
,
who
be
not
yet
much
over
fifty
,
be
rush
headlong
out
of
the
world
,
simply
because
he
be
the
one
man
whose
continue
life
at
the
present
moment
would
be
serviceable
to
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
as
he
think
of
his
grandfather
he
almost
break
his
umbrella
by
the
vehemence
with
which
he
strike
it
against
the
pavement
.
<EOS>
what
right
could
an
ignorant
old
fool
like
that
have
to
live
for
ever
,
keep
the
possession
of
a
property
which
he
could
not
use
,
and
ruin
those
who
be
to
come
after
him
?
<EOS>
if
now
,
at
this
moment
,
that
wretche
place
down
in
Westmoreland
could
become

from

his

money

him
much
bitter
suffering

as
be
always
the
case
in

matter

the
thing
do
be
bad
than
the
doing
of
it

<EOS>
He
have
teach
himself
to
look
at
it
lightly
whilst
it
be
yet
unaccomplishe

he
could
not

Kate

It
would
have
be
well
for
him
to
take
her
money

<EOS>
any
money
would
have
be
well
than
that
upon
which
he
have
lay
his
sacrilegious
hand

<EOS>
if
he
could
have
cut
a
purse
,
after
the
old
fashion

the
stain

hardly
have
be

deep

<EOS>
in

indeed
,
after

he
do
not

try
to
persuade
himself
that

stay
away

coldness

but
,
in
truth
,
he
be
afraid
of
see
her

afraid

Parliament
Meets

<EOS>
Parliament
open
that
year
on
the
twelfth
of
February
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
be
one
of
the
first
Members
of
the
Lower
House
to
take
his
seat
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
generally
assert
through
the
country
,
during
the
last
week
,
that
the
exist
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
have
,
so
to
say
,
cease
to
exist
as
such
;
that
though
he
still
exist
to
the
outer
world
,
draw
his
salary
,
and
do
routine
work
,
 
if
a
man
so
big
can
have
any
routine
work
to
do
,
 
he
exist
no
longer
in
the
inner
world
of
the
cabinet
.
<EOS>
He
have
differ
,
man
say
,
with
his
friend
and
chief
,
the
Prime
Minister
,
as
to
the
expediency
of
repeal
what
be
leave
of
the
direct
taxis
of
the
country
,
and
be
prepared
to
launch
himself
into
opposition
with
his
small
bodyguard
of
follower
,
with
all
his
energy
and
with
all
his
venom
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
very
pleasant
in
the
close
,
bosom
friendship
,
and
bitter
,
uncompromising
animosity
,
of
these
human
god
,
 
of
these
human
being
who
would
be
god
be
they
not
shorn
so
short
of
their
divinity
in
that
matter
of
immortality
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
so
arrange
that
the
same
person
be
always
friend
,
and
the
same
person
be
always
enemy
,
as
use
to
be
the
case
among
the
dear
old
heathen
god
and
goddess
;
 
if
Parliament
be
an
Olympus
in
which
Juno
and
Venus
never
kiss
,
the
thing
would
not
be
nearly
so
interesting
.
<EOS>
but
in
this
Olympus
partner
be
change
,
the
divine
bosom
,
now
rabid
with
hatred
against
some
oppose
deity
,
suddenly
become
replete
with
love
towards
its
late
enemy
,
and
exciting
change
occur
which
give
to
the
whole
thing
all
the
keen
interest
of
a
sensational
novel
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
this
be
greatly
lessen
for
those
who
come
too
near
the
scene
of
action
.
<EOS>
member
of
Parliament
,
and
the
friend
of
Members
of
Parliament
,
be
apt
to
teach
themselves
that
it
mean
nothing
;
that
Lord
this
do
not
hate
Mr.
that
,
or
think
him
a
traitor
to
his
country
,
or
wish
to
crucify
him
;
and
that
Sir
John
of
the
Treasury
be
not
much
in
earnest
when
he
speak
of
his
noble
friend
at
the
"
Foreign
Office
"
as
a
god
to
whom
no
other
god
be
ever
comparable
in
honesty
,
discretion
,
patriotism
,
and
genius
.
<EOS>
but
the
outside
Briton
who
take
a
delight
in
politic
,
 
and
this
description
should
include
ninety
-
nine
educate
Englishmen
out
of
every
hundred
,
 
should
not
be
desirous
of
peep
behind
the
scene
.
<EOS>
no
beholder
at
any
theatre
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
It
be
good
to
believe
in
these
friendship
and
these
enmity
,
and
very
pleasant
to
watch
their
change
.
<EOS>
It
be
delightful
when
Oxford
embrace
Manchester
,
find
that
it
can
not
live
without
support
in
that
quarter
;
and
very
delightful
when
the
uncompromising
assailant
of
all
man
in
power
receive
the
legitimate
reward
of
his
energy
by
be
take
in
among
the
bosom
of
the
bless
.
  
<EOS>
but
although
the
outer
world
be
so
sure
that
the
exist
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
have
cease
to
exist
,
when
the
House
of
Commons
meet
that
gentleman
take
his
seat
on
the
Treasury
Bench
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
have
by
no
mean
give
a
general
support
to
the
Ministry
in
the
last
session
,
take
his
seat
on
the
same
side
of
the
House
indeed
,
but
low
down
,
and
near
to
the
cross
bench
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
sit
close
behind
him
,
and
man
know
that
Mr.
Bott
be
a
distinguished
member
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
party
,
whatever
that
party
may
be
.
<EOS>
Lord
Cinquebars
move
the
address
,
and
I
must
confess
that
he
do
it
very
lamely
.
<EOS>
He
be
once
accuse
by
Mr.
Maxwell
,
the
brewer
,
of
make
a
great
noise
in
the
hunting
-
field
.
<EOS>
the
accusation
could
not
be
repeat
as
to
his
performance
on
this
occasion
,
as
no
one
could
hear
a
word
that
he
say
.
<EOS>
the
address
be
second
by
Mr.
Loftus
Fitzhoward
,
a
nephew
of
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
,
who
speak
as
though
he
be
resolve
to
trump
poor
Lord
Cinquebars
in
every
sentence
which
he
pronounce
,
 
as
we
so
often
hear
the
second
clergyman
from
the
Communion
Table
trump
his
weary
predecessor
,
who
have
just
finish
the
Litany
not
in
the
clear
or
most
audible
voice
.
<EOS>
every
word
fall
from
Mr.
Fitzhoward
with
the
elaborate
accuracy
of
a
separate
pistol
-
shot
;
and
as
he
become
pleased
with
himself
in
his
progress
,
and
warm
with
his
work
,
he
accent
his
word
sharply
,
make
rhetorical
pause
,
even
move
his
hand
about
in
action
,
and
quite
disgust
his
own
party
,
who
have
be
very
well
satisfied
with
Lord
Cinquebars
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
rock
which
a
young
speaker
in
Parliament
should
avoid
,
but
no
rock
which
require
such
careful
avoiding
as
the
rock
of
eloquence
.
<EOS>
whatever
may
be
his
fault
,
let
him
at
least
avoid
eloquence
.
<EOS>
He
should
not
be
inaccurate
,
which
,
however
,
be
not
much
;
he
should
not
be
long
-
winded
,
which
be
a
good
deal
;
he
should
not
be
ill
-
temper
,
which
be
more
;
but
none
of
these
fault
be
so
damnable
as
eloquence
.
<EOS>
all
Mr.
Fitzhoward
's
friend
and
all
his
enemy
know
that
he
have
have
his
chance
,
and
that
he
have
throw
it
away
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
Queen
's
speech
there
have
be
some
very
lukewarm
allusion
to
remission
of
direct
taxation
.
<EOS>
this
remission
,
which
have
already
be
carry
so
far
,
should
be
carry
further
if
such
further
carrying
be
find
practicable
.
<EOS>
so
have
say
the
Queen
.
<EOS>
those
word
,
it
be
know
,
could
not
have
be
approve
of
by
the
energetic
and
still
exist
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
<EOS>
on
this
subject
the
mover
of
the
Address
say
never
a
word
,
and
the
seconder
only
a
word
or
two
.
<EOS>
what
they
have
say
have
,
of
course
,
be
lay
down
for
them
;
though
,
unfortunately
,
the
manner
of
say
could
not
be
so
easily
prescribe
.
<EOS>
then
there
arise
a
great
enemy
,
a
man
fluent
of
diction
,
apparently
with
deep
malice
at
his
heart
,
though
at
home
,
 
as
we
use
to
say
at
school
,
 
one
of
the
most
good
-
natured
fellow
in
the
world
;
one
ambitious
of
that
godship
which
a
seat
on
the
other
side
of
the
House
bestow
,
and
greedy
to
grasp
at
the
chance
which
this
disagreement
in
the
council
of
the
god
may
give
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
quite
content
,
he
say
,
to
vote
for
the
Address
,
as
,
he
believe
,
would
be
all
the
gentleman
on
his
side
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
no
one
could
suspect
them
or
him
of
give
a
factious
opposition
to
Government
.
<EOS>
have
they
not
bear
and
forborne
beyond
all
precedent
know
in
that
House
?
<EOS>
then
he
touch
lightly
,
and
almost
with
grace
to
his
opponent
,
on
many
subject
,
promise
support
,
and
barely
hint
that
they
be
totally
and
manifestly
wrong
in
all
thing
.
<EOS>
but
 
.
<EOS>
then
the
tone
of
his
voice
change
,
and
the
well
-
know
look
of
fury
be
assume
upon
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
then
great
jove
on
the
other
side
pull
his
hat
over
his
eye
,
and
smile
blandly
.
<EOS>
then
member
put
away
the
paper
they
have
be
read
for
a
moment
,
and
man
in
the
gallery
begin
to
listen
.
<EOS>
but
 
.
<EOS>
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
be
this
;
that
the
exist
Government
have
come
into
power
on
the
cry
of
a
reduction
of
taxation
,
and
now
they
be
go
to
shirk
the
responsibility
of
their
own
measure
.
<EOS>
They
be
go
to
shirk
the
responsibility
of
their
own
election
cry
,
although
it
be
know
that
their
own
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
be
prepared
to
carry
it
out
to
the
full
.
<EOS>
He
be
willing
to
carry
it
out
to
the
full
<EOS>
be
he
not
restrain
by
the
timidity
,
falsehood
,
and
treachery
of
his
colleague
,
of
whom
,
of
course
,
the
most
timid
,
the
most
false
,
and
the
most
treacherous
be
 
the
great
god
Jove
,
who
sit
blandly
smile
on
the
other
side
.
  
<EOS>
no
one
should
ever
go
near
the
House
of
Commons
who
wish
to
enjoy
all
this
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
manifestly
evident
that
neither
Jove
nor
any
of
his
satellite
care
twopence
for
what
the
irate
gentleman
be
say
;
nay
,
it
become
so
evident
that
,
in
spite
of
his
assume
fury
,
the
gentleman
be
not
irate
.
<EOS>
He
intend
to
communicate
his
look
of
anger
to
the
newspaper
report
of
his
speech
;
and
he
know
from
experience
that
he
could
succeed
in
that
.
<EOS>
and
man
walk
about
the
House
in
the
most
telling
moment
,
 
enemy
shake
hand
with
enemy
,
 
in
a
way
that
show
an
entire
absence
of
all
good
,
honest
hatred
among
them
.
<EOS>
but
the
gentleman
go
on
and
finish
his
speech
,
demand
at
last
,
in
direct
term
,
that
the
Treasury
Jove
should
state
plainly
to
the
House
who
be
to
be
,
and
who
be
not
to
be
,
the
bearer
of
the
purse
among
the
god
.
  
<EOS>
then
Treasury
Jove
get
up
smile
,
and
thank
his
enemy
for
the
cordiality
of
his
support
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
always
,
"
he
say
,
"
do
the
gentleman
's
party
justice
for
their
clemency
,
and
have
fear
no
opposition
from
them
;
and
he
be
glad
to
find
that
he
be
correct
in
his
anticipation
as
to
the
course
they
would
pursue
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
go
on
say
a
good
deal
about
home
matter
,
and
foreign
matter
,
prove
that
everything
be
right
,
just
as
easily
as
his
enemy
have
prove
that
everything
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
on
all
these
point
he
be
very
full
,
and
very
courteous
;
but
when
he
come
to
the
subject
of
taxation
,
he
simply
repeat
the
passage
from
the
Queen
's
speech
,
express
a
hope
that
his
right
honourable
friend
,
the
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
would
be
able
to
satisfy
the
judgement
of
the
House
,
and
the
wish
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
that
specially
personal
question
which
have
be
ask
he
do
not
answer
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
House
be
still
all
agog
,
as
be
the
crowded
gallery
.
<EOS>
the
energetic
and
still
exist
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
be
then
present
,
divide
only
by
one
little
thin
Secretary
of
State
from
Jove
himself
.
<EOS>
Would
he
get
up
and
declare
his
purpose
?
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
who
almost
always
do
get
up
when
an
opportunity
offer
itself
,
 
or
when
it
do
not
.
<EOS>
some
second
little
gun
be
fire
off
from
the
opposition
bench
,
and
then
there
be
a
pause
.
<EOS>
Would
the
purse
-
bearer
of
Olympus
rise
upon
his
wing
and
speak
his
mind
,
or
would
he
sit
in
silence
upon
his
cloud
?
<EOS>
there
be
a
general
call
for
the
purse
-
bearer
,
but
he
float
in
silence
,
and
be
inexplicable
.
<EOS>
the
purse
-
bearer
be
not
to
be
bully
into
any
sudden
reading
of
the
riddle
.
<EOS>
then
there
come
on
a
general
debate
about
money
matter
,
in
which
the
purse
-
bearer
do
say
a
few
word
,
but
he
say
nothing
as
to
the
great
question
at
issue
.
<EOS>
at
last
up
get
Mr.
Palliser
,
towards
the
close
of
the
evening
,
and
occupy
a
full
hour
in
explain
what
tax
the
Government
may
remit
with
safety
,
and
what
they
may
not
,
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
,
meanwhile
,
prompt
him
with
figure
from
behind
with
an
assiduity
that
be
almost
too
persistent
.
<EOS>
accord
to
Mr.
Palliser
,
the
word
use
in
the
Queen
's
speech
be
not
at
all
too
cautious
.
<EOS>
the
Members
go
out
gradually
,
and
the
House
become
very
thin
during
this
oration
;
but
the
newspaper
declare
,
next
morning
,
that
his
speech
have
be
the
speech
of
the
night
,
and
that
the
perspicuity
of
Mr.
Palliser
point
him
out
as
the
come
man
.
  
<EOS>
He
return
home
to
his
house
in
Park
Lane
quite
triumphant
after
his
success
,
and
find
Lady
Glencora
,
at
about
twelve
o'clock
,
sit
alone
.
<EOS>
She
have
arrive
in
town
on
that
day
,
have
come
up
at
her
own
request
,
instead
of
remain
at
Matching
Priory
till
after
Easter
,
as
he
have
propose
.
<EOS>
He
have
wish
her
to
stay
,
in
order
,
as
he
have
say
,
that
there
may
be
a
home
for
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
express
herself
unwilling
to
remain
without
him
,
explain
that
the
cousin
may
have
the
home
in
her
absence
,
as
well
as
they
could
in
her
presence
;
and
he
have
give
way
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
truth
,
she
have
learn
to
hate
her
cousin
iphy
Palliser
with
a
hatred
that
be
unreasonable
,
 
see
that
she
do
not
also
hate
Alice
Vavasor
,
who
have
do
as
much
to
merit
her
hatred
as
have
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
know
by
what
mean
her
absence
from
Monkshade
have
be
bring
about
.
<EOS>
Miss
Palliser
have
tell
her
all
that
have
pass
in
Alice
's
bedroom
on
the
last
night
of
Alice
's
stay
at
matching
,
and
have
,
by
so
do
,
contrive
to
prevent
the
visit
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
understand
well
all
that
Alice
have
say
:
and
yet
,
though
she
hate
Miss
Palliser
for
what
have
be
do
,
she
entertain
no
anger
against
Alice
.
<EOS>
of
course
Alice
would
have
prevent
that
visit
to
Monkshade
if
it
be
in
her
power
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
would
save
her
friend
.
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
Lady
Glencora
look
to
Alice
to
save
her
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
she
hate
Iphy
Palliser
for
engage
herself
in
the
same
business
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
look
to
Alice
to
save
her
,
and
yet
it
may
be
doubt
whether
she
do
,
in
truth
,
wish
to
be
save
.
  
<EOS>
while
she
be
at
Matching
,
and
before
Mr.
Palliser
have
return
from
Monkshade
,
a
letter
reach
her
,
by
what
mean
she
have
never
learn
.
<EOS>
"
a
letter
have
be
place
within
my
writing

she
say
to
her
maid
,
quite
openly
.
<EOS>
"
who
put
it
there
?
"
<EOS>
the
maid
have
declare
her
ignorance
in
a
manner
that
have
satisfied
Lady
Glencora
of
her
truth
.
<EOS>
"
if
such
a
thing
happen
again
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
"
I
shall
be
oblige
to
have
the
matter
investigate
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
allow
that
anything
should
be
put
into
my
room
surreptitiously
.
<EOS>
"
there
,
then
,
have
be
an
end
of
that
,
as
regard
any
step
take
by
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
the
letter
have
be
from
Burgo
Fitzgerald
,
and
have
contain
a
direct
proposal
that
she
should
go
off
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
at
Matching
,
"
the
letter
say
,
"
at
the
Inn
;
but
I
do
not
dare
to
show
myself
,
lest
I
should
do
you
an
injury
.
<EOS>
I
walk
round
the
house
yesterday
,
at
night
,
and
I
know
that
I
see
your
room
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
wrong
in
think
that
you
love
me
,
I
would
not
for
world
insult
you
by
my
presence
;
but
if
you
love
me
still
,
I
ask
you
to
throw
aside
from
you
that
fictitious
marriage
,
and
give
yourself
to
the
man
whom
,
if
you
love
him
,
you
should
regard
as
your
husband
.
<EOS>
"
there
have
be
more
of
it
,
but
it
have
be
to
the
same
effect
.
<EOS>
to
Lady
Glencora
it
have
seem
to
convey
an
assurance
of
devoted
love
,
 
of
that
love
which
,
in
former
day
,
her
friend
have
tell
her
be
not
within
the
compass
of
Burgo
's
nature
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
ask
her
to
meet
him
then
,
but
say
that
he
would
return
to
Matching
after
Parliament
be
meet
,
beg
her
to
let
him
have
some
mean
of
know
whether
her
heart
be
true
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
She
tell
no
one
of
the
letter
,
but
she
keep
it
,
and
read
it
over
and
over
again
in
the
silence
and
solitude
of
her
room
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
be
guilty
in
thus
read
it
,
 
even
in
keep
it
from
her
husband
's
knowledge
;
but
though
conscious
of
this
guilt
,
though
resolute
almost
in
its
commission
,
still
she
determine
not
to
remain
at
match
after
her
husband
's
departure
,
 
not
to
undergo
the
danger
of
remain
there
while
Burgo
Fitzgerald
should
be
in
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
analyse
her
own
wish
.
<EOS>
She
often
tell
herself
,
as
she
have
tell
Alice
,
that
it
would
be
well
for
them
all
that
she
should
go
away
;
that
in
throw
herself
even
to
the
dog
,
if
such
must
be
the
result
,
she
would
do
more
of
good
than
of
harm
.
<EOS>
She
declare
to
herself
,
in
the
most
passionate
word
she
could
use
,
that
she
love
this
man
with
all
her
heart
.
<EOS>
She
protest
that
the
fault
would
not
be
hers
,
but
theirs
,
who
have
force
her
to
marry
the
man
she
do
not
love
.
<EOS>
She
assure
herself
that
her
husband
have
no
affection
for
her
,
and
that
their
marriage
be
in
every
respect
prejudicial
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
recur
over
and
over
again
,
in
her
thought
,
to
her
own
childlessness
,
and
to
his
extreme
desire
for
an
heir
.
"
<EOS>
though
I
do
sacrifice
myself
,
"
she
would
say
,
"
I
shall
do
more
of
good
than
harm
,
and
I
can
not
be
more
wretched
than
I
be
now
.

<EOS>
but
yet
she
flee
to
London
because
she
fear
to
leave
herself
at
match
when
Burgo
Fitzgerald
should
be
there
.
<EOS>
She
send
no
answer
to
his
letter
.
<EOS>
She
make
no
preparation
for
go
with
him

<EOS>
She
long
to
see
Alice
,
to
whom
alone
,
since
her
marriage
,
have
she
ever
speak
of
her
love
,
and
intend
to
tell
her
the
whole
tale
of
that
letter
.
<EOS>
She
be
as
one
who
,
in
madness
,
be
resolute
to
throw
herself
from
a
precipice
,
but
to
whom
some
remnant
of
sanity
remain
which
force
her
to
seek
those
who
would
save
her
from
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
have
not
see
her
since
her
arrival
in
London
,
and
,
of
course
,
he
take
her
by
the
hand
and
kiss
her
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
the
embrace
of
a
brother
rather
than
of
a
lover
or
a
husband
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
with
her
full
woman
's
nature
,
understand
this
thoroughly
,
and
appreciate
by
instinct
the
true
bearing
of
every
touch
from
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
be
well

yes

quite
well

you

a
little
fatigued

no

they

<EOS>
"
no

they
do

people
during

House
of
Commons

I
fear
I
shall
never
make
you
a
politician

I
be
almost
afraid
you
never
will

I
be
not
the
less
anxious
for
your
success
,
since
you
wish
it
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
why
you
should
work
so
very
hard
;
but
,
as
you
like
it
,
I
be
as
anxious
as
anybody
can
be
that
you
should
triumph

<EOS>
"
yes

I
do
like
it

he
say
.

"
a
man
must
like
something

I
do
not
know
what
there
be
to
like
better
.
<EOS>
some
people
can
eat
and
drink
all
day

some
people
can
care
about
a
horse

<EOS>
I
can
do
neither

<EOS>
and
there
be
other
,
Lady
Glencora
think
,
who
could
love
to
lie
in
the
sun
,
and
could
look
up
into
the
eye
of
woman
,
and
seek
their
happiness
there
.
<EOS>
She
be
sure
,
at
any
rate
,
that
she
know
one
such
.
<EOS>
but
she
say
nothing
of
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
speak
for
a
moment
to
Lord
Brock
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brock
be
the
name
by
which
the
present
jove
of
the
Treasury
be
know
among
man

and
what
do
Lord
Brock
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
do
not
say
much
,
but
he
be
very
cordial
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
think
,
Plantagenet
,
that
he
could
appoint
you
if
he
please
?
<EOS>
do
not
he
do
it
all
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
in
one
sense
,
he
do
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
suppose
I
shall
ever
make
you
understand
.
"
<EOS>
He
endeavour
,
however
,
to
do
so
on
the
present
occasion
,
and
give
her
a
somewhat
long
lecture
on
the
working
of
the
British
Constitution
,
and
the
manner
in
which
british
politic

themselves

than
would

Lady

lustily

her
yawn

indeed

ignorant

this
be
too
much
for

be

necessary

decide
before

She
feel

be
hard

unreasonable

treat

see
Alice

I
wish
you
would
let

have
my
way

course
I

I
have
ask
you
this

then
he
leave
the
room

go
away
to
bed

<EOS>
but
Lady
Glencora
be
not
bring
to
repentance
by
her
husband
's
last
word
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
her
to
be
so
intolerably
cruel
,
this
demand
of
his
,
that
she
should
be
make
to
pass
the
whole
of
her
first
evening
in
town
with
an
old
woman
for
whom
it
be
impossible
that
she
should
entertain
the
slight
regard
,
that
she
resolve
upon
rebellion
.
<EOS>
have
he
positively
order
Mrs.
Marsham
,
she
would
have
send
for
that
lady
,
and
have
content
herself
with
endure
her
presence
in
disdainful
silence
;
but
Mr.
Palliser
have
not
give
any
order
.
<EOS>
He
have
make
a
request
,
and
a
request
,
from
its
very
nature
,
admit
of
no
obedience
.
<EOS>
the
compliance
with
a
request
must
be
voluntary
,
and
she
would
not
send
for
Mrs.

upon
compulsion
.
<EOS>
have
not
she
also
make
a
request
to
him

have
not
he
refuse
it

<EOS>
It
be
his
prerogative
,
undoubtedly
,
to
command
;
but
in
that
matter
of
request
she
have
a
right
to
expect
that
her
voice
should
be
as
potent
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
She
write
a
line
,
therefore
,
to
Alice
before
she
go
to
bed
,
beg
her
cousin
to
come
to
her
early
on
the
follow
day
,
so
that
they
may
go
out
together
,
and
then
afterwards
dine
in
company
with
Mr.
Bott
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
will
be
an
inducement
to
you
,
"
Lady
Glencora
say
,
"
because
your
generous
heart
will
feel
of
what
service
you
may
be
to
me
.
<EOS>
nobody
else
will
be
here
,
 
unless
,
indeed
,
Mrs.
Marsham
should
be
ask
,
unknown
to
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
then
she
sit
herself
down
to
think
,
 
to
think
especially
about
the
cruelty
of
husband
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
tell
over
and
over
again
,
in
the
day
before
her
marriage
,
that
Burgo
would
ill
-
use
her
if
he
become
her
husband
.
<EOS>
the
Marquis
of
Auld
Reekie
have
go
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
Burgo
may
probably
beat
her
.
<EOS>
but
what
hard
treatment
,
even
what
beating
,
could
be
so
unendurable
as
this
total
want
of
sympathy
,
as
this
deadness
in
life
,
which
her
present
lot
entail
upon
her
?
<EOS>
as
for
that
matter
of
beat
,
she
ridicule
the
idea
in
her
very
soul
.
<EOS>
She
sit
smile
at
the
absurdity
of
the
thing
as
she
think
of
the
beauty
of
Burgo
's
eye
,
of
the
softness
of
his
touch
,
of
the
loving
,
almost
worship
,
tone
of
his
voice
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
even
be
well
to
be
beat
by
him
than
to
have
politic
explain
to
her
at
one
o'clock
at
night
by
such
a
husband
as
Plantagenet
Palliser
?
<EOS>
the
British
Constitution
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
have
she
marry
Burgo
<EOS>
they
would
have
be
in
sunny
Italy
,
and
he
would
have
tell
her
some
other
tale
than
that
as
they
sit
together
under
the
pale
moonlight
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
little
water
-
colour
drawing
call
Raphael
and
Fornarina
,
and
she
be
infantine
enough
to
tell
herself
that
the
so
-
call
Raphael
be
like
her
Burgo
 
<EOS>
no
,
not
her
burgo
,
but
the
Burgo
that
be
not
her
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
all
the
romance
of
the
picture
she
may
have
enjoy
have
they
allow
her
to
dispose
as
she
have
wish
of
her
own
hand
.
<EOS>
She
may
have
sit
in
marble
balcony
,
while
the
vine
cluster
over
her
head
,
and
he
would
have
be
at
her
knee
,
hardly
speak
to
her
,
but
make
his
presence
feel
by
the
halo
of
its
divinity
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
call
upon
her
for
no
hard
reply
.
<EOS>
with
him
near
her
she
would
have
enjoy
the
soft
air
,
and
would
have
sit
happy
,
without
trouble
,
lap
in
the
delight
of
loving
.
<EOS>
It
be
thus
that
Fornarina
sit
.
<EOS>
and
why
should
not
such
a
lot
have
be
her
?
<EOS>
Her
Raphael
would
have
love
her
,
let
them
say
what
they
would
about
his
cruelty
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
,
wretched
,
overburthened
child
,
to
whom
the
common
lesson
of
life
have
not
yet
be
teach
,
and
who
have
now
fall
into
the
hand
of
one
who
be
so
ill
-
fit
to
teach
them
!
<EOS>
who
would
not
pity
her
?
<EOS>
who
could
say
that
the
fault
be
her
?
<EOS>
the
world
have
lade
her
with
wealth
till
she
have
have
no
limb
free
for
its
ordinary
use
,
and
then
have
turn
her
loose
to
run
her
race
!
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
write
to
your
cousin
?
"
<EOS>
her
husband
ask
her
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
His
voice
,
as
he
speak
,
clearly
show
that
his
anger
be
either
over
or
suppress
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
have
ask
her
to
come
and
drive
,
and
then
to
stay
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
I
shall
send
the
carriage
for
her
if
she
can
come
.
<EOS>
the
man
be
to
wait
for
an
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
very
well
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
,
mildly
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
after
a
short
pause
,
he
add
,
"
as
that
be
settle
,
perhaps
you
would
have
no
objection
to
ask
Mrs.
Marsham
also
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
will
not
she
probably
be
engage
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
think
not
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
and
then
he
add
,
be
ashamed
of
the
tinge
of
falsehood
of
which
he
would
otherwise
have
be
guilty
,
"
I
know
she
be
not
engage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
expect
to
come
,
then
?
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
ask
her
,
if
you
mean
that
,
Glencora
.
<EOS>
have
I
do
so
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
say
so
.
<EOS>
I
tell
her
that
I
do
not
know
what
your
engagement
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
write
to
her
,
if
you
please
,
"
say
the
wife
,
who
feel
that
she
could
hardly
refuse
any
longer
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
,
my
dear
!
"
say
the
husband
.
<EOS>
so
Lady
Glencora
do
write
to
Mrs.
Marsham
,
who
promise
to
come
,
 
as
do
also
Alice
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
would
,
at
any
rate
,
have
Alice
to
herself
for
some
hour
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
at
first
she
take
comfort
in
that
reflection
;
but
after
a
while
she
bethink
herself
that
she
would
not
know
what
to
tell
Alice
,
or
what
not
to
tell
.
<EOS>
do
she
mean
to
show
that
letter
to
her
cousin
?
<EOS>
if
she
do
show
it
,
then
,
 
so
she
argue
with
herself
,
 
she
must
bring
herself
to
endure
the
wretchedness
of
her
present
lot
,
and
must
give
up
for
ever
all
her
dream
about
Raphael
and
Fornarina
.
<EOS>
if
she
do
not
show
it
,
 
or
,
at
any
rate
,
tell
of
it
,
 
then
it
would
come
to
pass
that
she
would
leave
her
husband
under
the
protection
of
another
man
,
and
she
would
become
 
what
she
do
not
dare
to
name
even
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
declare
that
so
it
must
be
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
she
would
go
with
Burgo
,
should
he
ever
come
to
her
with
the
mean
of
go
at
his
and
her
instant
command
.
<EOS>
but
should
she
bring
herself
to
let
Alice
know
that
such
a
letter
have
be
convey
to
her
,
Burgo
would
never
have
such
power
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
the
story
of
a
case
of
abduction
in
which
a
man
be
try
for
his
life
,
and
be
acquit
,
because
the
lady
have
acquiesce
in
the
carrying
away
while
it
be
in
progress
.
<EOS>
She
have
,
as
she
herself
declare
,
armed
herself
with
a
sure
and
certain
charm
or
talisman
against
such
danger
,
which
she
keep
suspend
round
her
neck
;
but
whilst
she
be
in
the
post
-
chaise
she
open
the
window
and
throw
the
charm
from
her
,
no
longer
desire
,
as
the
learn
counsel
for
the
defence
efficiently
allege
,
to
be
keep
under
the
bond
of
such
protection
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
's
state
of
mind
be
,
in
its
nature
,
nearly
the
same
as
that
of
the
lady
in
the
post
-
chaise
.
<EOS>
whether
or
no
she
would
use
her
charm
,
she
have
not
yet
decide
,
but
the
power
of
do
so
be
still
hers
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
come
,
and
the
greeting
between
the
cousin
be
very
affectionate
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
receive
her
as
though
they
have
be
playmate
from
early
childhood
;
and
Alice
,
though
such
impulsive
love
be
not
natural
to
her
as
to
the
other
,
could
not
bring
herself
to
be
cold
to
one
who
be
so
warm
to
her
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
have
she
not
promise
her
love
in
that
meeting
at
Matching
Priory
in
which
her
cousin
have
tell
her
of
all
her
wretchedness
?
<EOS>
"
I
will
love
you
!
"
<EOS>
Alice
have
say
;
and
though
there
be
much
in
Lady
Glencora
that
she
could
not
approve
,
 
much
even
that
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
like
,
 
still
she
would
not
allow
her
heart
to
contradict
her
word
.
  
<EOS>
They
sit
so
long
over
the
fire
in
the
drawing
-
room
that
at
last
they
agree
that
the
driving
should
be
abandon
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
use
of
it
?
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
to
see
,
and
the
wind
be
as
cold
as
charity
.
<EOS>
We
be
much
more
comfortable
here
;
be
we
not
?
"
<EOS>
alice
quite
acquiesce
in
this
,
have
no
great
desire
to
be
drive
through
the
park
in
the
gloom
of
a
February
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
have
Dandy
and
Flirt
up
here
,
there
would
be
some
fun
in
it

Mr.
Palliser
do
not
wish
me
to
drive
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
would
be
dangerous

<EOS>
not
in

I

an
idea

fast

<EOS>

so
it
do

<EOS>
if
I
be

my
wife
to
drive
horse
about
London

why
not

just

what

the
harm

I
be
sure
they
would

Mr.

for
that

I
can
tell
you
something
else
he
do

He
do
not

<EOS>
She
have
be
a
true
wife
,
though
sometimes
too
strong
-
minded
,
and
a
painstaking
mother
,
whose
child
,
however
,
have
never
love
her
as
most
mother
like
to
be
love
.
  
<EOS>
the
catalogue
of
her
fault
must
be
quite
as
long
as
that
of
her
virtue
.
<EOS>
She
be
one
of
those
woman
who
be
ambitious
of
power
,
and
not
very
scrupulous
as
to
the
manner
in
which
they
obtain
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
hardhearte
,
and
capable
of
pursue
an
object
without
much
regard
to
the
injury
she
may
do
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
flatter
wealth
or
fawn
before
a
title
,
but
she
be
not
above
any
artifice
by
which
she
may
ingratiate
herself
with
those
whom
it
suit
her
purpose
to
conciliate
.
<EOS>
She
think
evil
rather
than
good
.
<EOS>
She
be
herself
untrue
in
action
,
if
not
absolutely
in
word
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
that
she
would
coin
lie
,
but
she
would
willingly
leave
false
impression
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
the
bosom
friend
,
and
in
many
thing
the
guide
in
life
,
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
mother
;
and
she
take
a
special
interest
in
Mr.
Palliser
's
welfare
.
<EOS>
when
he
marry
,
she
hear
the
story
of
the
love
of
Burgo
and
Lady
Glencora
;
and
though
she
think
well
of
the
money
,
she
be
not
dispose
to
think
very
well
of
the
bride
.
<EOS>
She
make
up
her
mind
that
the
young
lady
would
want
watch
,
and
she
be
of
opinion
that
no
one
would
be
so
well
able
to
watch
Lady
Glencora
as
herself
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
plainly
open
her
mind
on
this
matter
to
Mr.
Palliser
;
she
have
not
make
any
distinct
suggestion
to
him
that
she
would
act
as
Argus
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
would
have
reject
any
such
suggestion
,
and
Mrs.
Marsham
know
that
he
would
do
so
;
but
she
have
let
a
word
or
two
drop
,
hint
that
Lady
Glencora
be
very
young
,
 
hint
that
Lady
Glencora
's
manner
be
charm
in
their
childlike
simplicity
;
but
hinting
also
that
precaution
be
,
for
that
reason
,
the
more
necessary
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
suspect
nothing
as
to
Burgo
or
as
to
any
other
special
peril
,
whose
whole
disposition
be
void
of
suspicion
,
whose
dry
nature
realize
neither
the
delight
nor
the
danger
of
love
,
acknowledge
that
Glencora
be
young
.
<EOS>
He
especially
wish
that
she
should
be
discreet
and
matronly
;
he
fear
no
lover
,
but
he
fear
that
she
may
do
silly
thing
,
 
that
she
would
catch
cold
,
 
and
not
know
how
to
live
a
life
become
the
wife
of
a
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
<EOS>
therefore
he
submit
Glencora
,
 
and
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
himself
,
 
into
the
hand
of
Mrs.
Marsham
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
have
not
be
twenty
-
four
hour
in
the
house
with
this
lady
before
she
recognize
in
her
a
duenna
.
<EOS>
in
all
such
matter
no
one
could
be
quick
than
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
She
may
be
very
ignorant
about
the
British
Constitution
,
and
,
alas
!
<EOS>
very
ignorant
also
as
to
the
real
element
of
right
and
wrong
in
a
woman
's
conduct
,
but
she
be
no
fool
.
<EOS>
She
have
an
eye
that
could
see
,
and
an
ear
that
could
understand
,
and
an
abundance
of
that
feminine
instinct
which
teach
a
woman
to
know
her
friend
or
her
enemy
at
a
glance
,
at
a
touch
,
at
a
word
.
<EOS>
in
many
thing
Lady
Glencora
be
much
quick
,
much
more
clever
,
than
her
husband
,
though
he
be
to
be
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
and
though
she
do
know
nothing
of
the
Constitution
.
<EOS>
She
know
,
too
,
that
he
be
easily
to
be
deceive
,
 
that
though
his
intelligence
be
keen
,
his
instinct
be
dull
,
 
that
he
be
gift
with
no
fineness
of
touch
,
with
no
subtle
appreciation
of
the
character
of
man
and
woman
;
and
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
she
look
down
upon
him
for
his
obtusity
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
be
aware
that
Burgo
be
a
danger
to
be
avoid
;
and
he
should
have
be
aware
also
that
Mrs.
Marsham
be
a
duenna
not
to
be
employ
.
<EOS>
when
a
woman
know
that
she
be
guard
by
a
watch
-
dog
,
she
be
bind
to
deceive
her
Cerberus
,
if
it
be
possible
,
and
be
usually
not
ill
-
disposed
to
deceive
also
the
owner
of
Cerberus
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
feel
that
Mrs.
Marsham
be
her
Cerberus
,
and
she
be
heartily
resolve
that
if
she
be
to
be
keep
in
the
proper
line
at
all
,
she
would
not
be
so
keep
by
Mrs.
Marsham
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
rise
and
accept
Mrs.
Marsham
's
salutation
quite
as
coldly
as
it
have
be
give
,
and
from
that
time
forward
those
two
lady
be
enemy
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham
,
grope
quite
in
the
dark
,
partly
guess
that
Alice
have
in
some
way
interfere
to
prevent
Lady
Glencora
's
visit
to
Monkshade
,
and
,
though
such
prevention
be
,
no
doubt
,
good
in
that
lady
's
eye
,
she
resent
the
interference
.
<EOS>
She
have
make
up
her
mind
that
Alice
be
not
the
sort
of
friend
that
Lady
Glencora
should
have
about
her
.
<EOS>
Alice
recognize
and
accept
the
feud
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
may
find
you
at
home
,
"
say
Mrs.
Marsham
,
"
as
I
know
you
be
lazy
about
go
out
in
the
cold
,
 
unless
it
be
for
a
foolish
midnight
ramble
,
"
and
Mrs.
Marsham
shake
her
head
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
little
woman
,
with
sharp
small
eye
,
with
a
permanent
colour
in
her
face
,
and
two
short
,
crisp
,
grey
curl
at
each
side
of
her
face
;
always
well
dressed
,
always
in
good
health
,
and
,
as
Lady
Glencora
believe
,
altogether
incapable
of
fatigue
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
ramble
you
speak
of
be
very
wise
,
I
think
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
;
"
but
I
never
could
see
the
use
of
drive
about
in
London
in
the
middle
of
winter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
one
ought
to
go
out
of
the
house
every
day
,
"
say
Mrs.
Marsham
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
all
those
rule
.
<EOS>
do
not
you
,
Alice
?
<EOS>
"
Alice
do
not
hate
them
,
therefore
she
say
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Glencora
,
one
must
live
by
rule
in
this
life
.
<EOS>
You
may
as
well
say
that
you
hate
sit
down
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
do
,
very
often
;
almost
always
when
there
be
company
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
get
over
that
feeling
after
another
season
in
town
,
"
say
Mrs.
Marsham
,
pretend
to
suppose
that
Lady
Glencora
allude
to
some
remain
timidity
in
receive
her
own
guest
.
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
I
do
not
think
I
shall
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
thing
that
seem
always
to
be
get
more
grievous
,
instead
of
less
so
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
be
come
to
dine
here
to

night

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
mistake
the
meaning
of
this

<EOS>
there
be
no
pretend
even
to
mistake
it
.
<EOS>
now
,
Mrs.
Marsham
have
accept
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
from
Mr.
Bott
,
 
not
because
she
especially
like
him
,
but
in
compliance
with
the
apparent
necessity
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
position
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
have
make
good
his
ground
about
Mr.
Palliser
;
and
Mrs.
Marsham
,
as
she
be
not
strong
enough
to
turn
him
off
from
it
,
have
give
him
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
be
a
Member
of
Parliament
,

a
very
serviceable
friend
of
Mr.
Palliser

,
"

Mrs.

<EOS>
"
all
the

we

He

<EOS>
"
I

It
can
be

of
small
matter
to
you

Miss
Vavasor

Mrs.

you
will
not

of

very
small
moment

He

I

of
course
you
do
not

Mrs.

I
should
not

it

so
fully
employ
as
Mr.

employ
,
too
,
on

such
vast

would
have

I

I

She

You

the
morning

it
not

<EOS>
Poor

<EOS>
it
make
her
very
ill
;
so
much
so
,
that
she
could
not
go
to
Monkshade

as
she
particularly
wish
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
sad
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
be
very
delicate
,
 
very
delicate
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
We
,
who
have
the
privilege

be
near
her

ought
always
to
remember

I
suppose
you

I

be
very
sorry

Lady
Glencora

<EOS>
what
I
mean
be
,
not
robust

Miss

<EOS>
Her
general
organization
,
if
you
understand
me
,
be
exquisitely
delicate

<EOS>
one
can
see
that
,
I
think
,
in

eye

"
  
<EOS>
Alice
be
go
to
protest
that
she
have
never
see
it
at
all
,
when
Mr.
Palliser
enter
the
room
along
with
Mrs.
Marsham
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
gentleman
shake
hand
,
and
then
Mr.
Palliser
turn
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
She
perceive
at
once
by
his
face
that
she
be
unwelcome
,
and
wish
herself
away
from
his
house
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
all
very
well
for
Lady
Glencora
to
fight
with
Mrs.
Marsham
,
 
and
with
her
husband
,
too
,
in
regard
to
the
Marsham
persecution
,
 
but
there
could
be
no
reason
why
she
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
just
touch
her
hand
,
barely
close
his
thumb
upon
her
finger
,
and
ask
her
how
she
be
.
<EOS>
then
he
turn
away
from
her
side
of
the
fire
,
and
begin
talk
to
Mrs.
Marsham
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
there
be
that
in
his
face
and
in
his
manner
which
be
positively
offensive
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
make
no
allusion
to
his
former
acquaintance
with
her
,
 
speak
no
word
about
Matching
,
no
word
about
his
wife
,
as
he
would
naturally
have
do
to
his
wife
's
friend
.
<EOS>
Alice
feel
the
blood
mount
into
her
face
,
and
regret
greatly
that
she
have
ever
come
among
these
people
.
<EOS>
have
she
not
long
since
make
up
her
mind
that
she
would
avoid
her
great
relation
,
and
do
not
all
this
prove
that
it
would
have
be
well
for
her
to
have
cling
to
that
resolution
?
<EOS>
what
be
Lady
Glencora
to
her
that
she
should
submit
herself
to
be
treat
as
though
she
be
a
poor
companion
,
 
a
dependent
,
who
receive
a
salary
for
her
attendance
,
 
an
indigent
cousin
,
hang
on
to
the
bounty
of
her
rich
connection
?
<EOS>
Alice
be
proud
to
a
fault
.
<EOS>
She
have
nurse
her
pride
till
it
be
very
faulty
.
<EOS>
all
her
trouble
and
sorrow
in
life
have
come
from
an
overfed
craving
for
independence
.
<EOS>
why
,
then
,
should
she
submit
to
be
treat
with
open
want
of
courtesy
by
any
man
;
but
,
of
all
man
,
why
should
she
submit
to
it
from
such
a
one
as
Mr.
Palliser
,
 
the
heir
of
a
ducal
house
,
roll
in
wealth
,
and
magnificent
with
all
the
magnificence
of
british
pomp
and
pride
?
<EOS>
no
;
she
would
make
Lady
Glencora
understand
that
the
close
intimacy
of
daily
life
be
not
possible
to
them
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
declare
I
be
very
much
ashamed
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
as
she
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
apologize
to
you
,
Alice
,
for
it
be
you
who
keep
me
talk
;
but
I
do
beg
Mrs.
Marsham
's
pardon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham
be
all
smile
and
forgiveness
,
and
hope
that
Lady
Glencora
would
not
make
a
stranger
of
her
.
<EOS>
then
dinner
be
announce
,
and
Alice
have
to
walk
down
stair
by
herself
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
care
a
doit
for
that
,
but
there
have
be
a
disagreeable
little
contest
when
the
moment
come
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
have
wish
to
give
up
Mr.
Bott
to
her
cousin
,
but
Mr.
Bott
have
stick
manfully
to
Lady
Glencora
's
side
.
<EOS>
He
hope
to
take
Lady
Glencora
down
to
dinner
very
often
,
and
be
not
at
all
dispose
to
abate
his
privilege
.
  
<EOS>
during
dinner
-
time
Alice
say
very
little
,
nor
be
there
give
to
her
opportunity
of
say
much
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
but
think
of
the
day
of
her
first
arrival
at
Matching
Priory
,
when
she
have
sit
between
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
and
Jeffrey
Palliser
,
and
when
everybody
have
be
so
civil
to
her
!
<EOS>
She
now
occupy
one
side
of
the
table
by
herself
,
away
from
the
fire
,
where
she
feel
cold
and
desolate
in
the
gloom
of
the
large
half
-
light
room
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
occupy
himself
with
Mrs.
Marsham
,
who
talk
politic
to
him
;
and
Mr.
Bott
never
lose
a
moment
in
his
endeavour
to
say
some
civil
word
to
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
give
him
no
encouragement
;
but
she
hardly
dare
to
snub
him
openly
in
her
husband
's
immediate
presence
.
<EOS>
twenty
time
during
dinner
she
say
some
little
word
to
Alice
,
attempt
at
first
to
make
the
time
pleasant
,
and
then
,
when
the
matter
be
too
far
go
for
that
,
attempt
to
give
some
relief
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
of
no
avail
.
<EOS>
there
be
moment
in
which
conversation
seem
to
be
impossible
,
 
in
which
the
very
god
interfere
to
put
a
seal
upon
the
lip
of
the
unfortunate
one
.
<EOS>
It
be
such
a
moment
now
with
Alice
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
as
yet
be
use
to
snub
.
<EOS>
whatever
position
she
have
hitherto
hold
,
in
that
she
have
always
stand
foremost
,
 
much
more
so
than
have
be
good
for
her
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
go
to
Matching
,
she
have
tremble
for
her
position
;
but
there
all
have
go
well
with
her
;
there
Lady
Glencora
's
kindness
have
at
first
be
able
to
secure
for
her
a
reception
that
have
be
flattering
,
and
almost
better
than
flattering
.
<EOS>
Jeffrey
Palliser
have
be
her
friend
,
and
would
,
have
she
so
will
it
,
have
be
more
than
her
friend
.
<EOS>
but
now
she
feel
that
the
hall
of
the
Pallisers
be
too
cold
for
her
,
and
that
the
sooner
she
escape
from
their
gloom
and
hard
discourtesy
the
well
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham

when
the
three
lady
have
return
to
the
drawing
-
room
together
,
be
a
little
triumphant
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
have
put
Alice
down
;
and
with
the
energetic
prudence
of
a
good
general
who
know
that
he
should
follow
up
a
victory
,
let
the
cost
of
do
so
be
what
it
may
,
she
determine
to
keep
her
down
.
<EOS>
Alice
have
resolve
that
she
would
come
as
seldom
as
may
be
to
Mr.
Palliser
's
house
in
Park
Lane
.
<EOS>
that
resolution
on
her
part
be
in
close
accordance
with
Mrs.
Marsham
's
own
view

<EOS>
"

I

there
for

It
be
not
often
that
Lady
Glencora
make
any
allusion
to
her
own
property
,
or
allow
any
one
near
her
to
suppose
that
she
remember
the
fact

<EOS>
in
some
thing
her
taste
be
not
delicate
as
should
be
that
of

,
as
regard
her
money

no
woman
could
have
behave
with
great
reticence

a
purer
delicacy

now

when

"
what
can
he
do

"
say
Mr.
Bott
,
who
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
could
be
very
great
,
 
who
,
for
a
moment

could
almost
feel
that

become
a
leader
of

for
himself

some

institute
a
Bott
Ministry

"
what

<EOS>
You
will
very
shortly
see
what
he
can
do

<EOS>
He
can
make
himself
the
master
of
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
if
Lord
Brock
do
not
look
about
him
,
he
will
find
that
Mr.
Palliser
will
be
in
the
Cabinet
without
his
help

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not

that
the
Queen
will
send
for
Planty
Pall

say
the
young

<EOS>
"
I
mean
to

may
direct

Mr.

conceive
himself
to

gauge
the
very
depth
of

how

it
be

"

why

among

vote

though
it
must
be
presume
that
it

understand
by
some
portion
of
the
Chelsea
elector
,
it
be
perfectly
unintelligible
to
the
majority
of
those

read
it

<EOS>
His
special
acquaintance

his
general
enemy
call
him
Viscount
Riverbank
,

he
be
pester
on
all
side
by
question

Father
Thames

<EOS>
It
be
Mr.

who
invent
the
legend
,
and
who
give
George
Vavasor
an
infinity
of
trouble
by
the
invention

<EOS>
there
be
a
question
in
those
day
as
to

the

Parliament
up

the
remote
desolation

further
Pimlico

Mr.

recommend
the
come
Member
to
pledge
himself
that
he
would
have
the
work
carry
on
even
to
Battersea
Bridge

<EOS>
"
You
must

plead
Mr.

"
<EOS>
no

can
do
anything
without
a

<EOS>
and
it
should
be
local
;
 
that
be
to
say
,
if
you
have
anything
of
a
constituency
.
<EOS>
such
a
subject
as
that
,
if
it
be
well
worked
,
may
save
you
thousand
of

thousand
of

It
will
not

me
anything
at

I
take
it

it
may
secure
the

Mr.

afterwards
make
you
the
most
popular
metropolitan
Member
in
the
House

that

with

<EOS>
only
look
at

what

<EOS>
Mr.

almost
become
eloquent

explain
the
nature

a
good
parliamentary
subject

You
should
work
it
up

so

it

it
at

I

<EOS>
Vavasor
allow
Mr.

to
manage
the
matter
for
him
,

take
up
the
subject
of
the
River
Bank

be
carry
about

iron
shoulder

strap

and
huge
pasteboard
placard
six
foot
high
on
the
top
of
them

<EOS>
You
would
think
,
as
you
see
the
long
row
,
that
the
man
be
be
marshal
to
their
several
route
;
but
they
always
keep
together
 
four

twenty
at
the
heel

"
<EOS>
one
placard
at
a
time
would
strike
the
eye

Mr.

count
the
expense
up
to
himself

<EOS>
"
there
be
no
doubt

it

Mr.
Scruby
in
reply
.
<EOS>
"
one
placard
will
do
that

it
be
big
enough

then
side

<EOS>
the
same
word
repeat
in
column
down
the
whole

<EOS>
Vavasor
himself
declare
that
he
be
ashamed
to
walk
among
his

so
conspicuous
have
his
name
become

<EOS>
grime
see
it
,
and
be
dismay

<EOS>
at
first
,
Grimes
ridicule
the
cry
with
all
his
publican
's
wit
.
"
<EOS>
unless
he
mean
to
drown
hisself
in
the
Reach

it
be
hard
to
say
what
he
do
mean
by
all
that
gammon
about
the
River
Bank

"
say
Grimes
,
as
he
canvass
for
the
other
liberal
candidate

<EOS>
but
,
after
a
while
,
Grimes
be
drive
to
confess
that
Mr.

know
what
he
be
about
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
a
sharp

un
,
that
he

grime
in
the
inside
bar
of
the
"
Handsome

and
he
almost
regret
that
he
have
leave
the
leadership
of
Mr.

,
although
he
know
that
on
this
occasion
he
would
not

get
his
odd
money

<EOS>
George
Vavasor
,
with
much
labour
,
actually
do
get
up
the
subject
of
the
River
Bank
.
<EOS>
He
get
himself
introduce
to
man
belong
to
the
Metropolitan
Board
,
and
go
manfully
into
the
matter
of
pound
,
shilling
,
and
penny
.
<EOS>
He
be
able
even
to
work
himself
into
an
apparent
heat
when
he
be
tell
that
the
thing
be
out
of
the
question
;
and
soon
find
that
he
have
disciple
who
really
believe
in
him
.
<EOS>
if
he
could
have
bring
himself
to
believe
in
the
thing
,
 
if
he
could
have
be
induce
himself
to
care
whether
Chelsea
be
to
be
embank
or
no
,
the
work
would
not
have
be
so
difficult
to
him
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
it
would
have
do
good
to
him
,
if
to
no
one
else
.
<EOS>
but
such
belief
be
beyond
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
go
too
far
in
life
to
be
capable
of
believe
in
,
or
of
care
for
,
such
thing
.
<EOS>
He
be
ambitious
of
have
a
hand
in
the
government
of
his
country
,
but
he
be
not
capable
of
care
even
for
that
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
work
.
<EOS>
He
work
hard
,
and
speak
vehemently
,
and
promise
the
man
of
Chelsea
,
Pimlico
,
and
Brompton
that
the
path
of
London
westwards
have
hardly
commence
as
yet
.
<EOS>
Sloane
Street
should
be
the
new
Cheapside
.
<EOS>
square
should
arise
around
the
Chelsea
barrack
,
with
side
open
to
the
water
,
for
which
Belgravia
would
be
desert
.
<EOS>
there
should
be
palace
there
for
the
rich
,
because
the
rich
spend
their
rich
;
but
no
rich
man
's
palace
should
interfere
with
the
poor
man
be
right
to
the
River
Bank

<EOS>
three
million
and
a
half
should
be
spend
on

noble
street
to
be
construct
,
the
grand
pathway
that
the
world
should
ever
yet
have
see

three
million
and
a
half

draw
from

draw
from
anywhere
except
from

from
the
bloated
money

bag
of
the
City
Corporation
,
Vavasor
once
venture
to
declare
,
amidst
the
encourage
shout
of
the
man
of
Chelsea
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
be
force
to
own
that
his
pupil
work
the
subject
well
.
"
<EOS>
upon
my
word
,
that
be
uncommon
good
,
"
he
say
,
almost
pat
Vavasor
on
the
back
,
after
a
speech
in
which
he
have
vehemently
assert
that
his
ambition
to
represent
the
Chelsea
district
have
all
come
of
his
long
-
fix
idea
that
the
glory
of
future
London
would
be
bring
about
by
the
embankment
of
the
river
at
Chelsea
.
  
<EOS>
but
army
of
man
carry
big
board
,
and
public
-
house
open
at
every
corner
,
and
placard
in
which
the
letter
be
three
foot
long
,
cost
money
.
<EOS>
those
few
modest
hundred
which
Mr.
Scruby
have
already
receive
before
the
work
begin
,
have
be
pay
on
the
supposition
that
the
election
would
not
take
place
till
September
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
make
an
early
request
,
a
very
early
request
,
that
a
further
sum
of
fifteen
hundred
pound
should
be
place
in
his
hand
;
and
he
do
this
in
a
tone
which
clearly
signify
that
not
a
man
would
be
send
about
through
the
street
,
or
a
poster
put
upon
a
wall
,
till
this
request
have
be
concede
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
be
in
possession
of
two
very
distinct
manner
of
address
.
<EOS>
in
his
jovial
mood
,
when
he
be
instigate
his
client
to
fight
their
battle
well
,
it
may
almost
be
think
that
he
be
do
it
really
for
the
love
of
the
thing
;
and
some
client
,
so
think
,
have
believe
for
a
few
hour
that
scruby
,
in
his
jolly
,
passionate
eagerness
,
would
pour
out
his
own
money
like
dust
,
trust
implicitly
to
future
day
for
its
return
.
<EOS>
but
such
client
have
soon
encounter
Mr.
Scruby
's
other
manner
,
and
have
perceive
that
they
be
mistaken
.
  
<EOS>
the
thing
have
come
so
suddenly
upon
George
Vavasor
that
there
be
not
time
for
him
to
carry
on
his
further
operation
through
his
sister
.
<EOS>
have
he
write
to
Kate
,
 
<EOS>
let
him
have
write
in
<EOS>
what
language
he
would
,
 
she
would
have
first
rejoin
by
a
negative
,
and
there
would
have
be
a
correspondence
before
he
have
induce
her
to
comply
.
<EOS>
He
think
of
send
for
her
by
telegram
,
but
even
in
that
there
would
have
be
too
much
delay
.
<EOS>
He
resolve
,
therefore
,
to
make
his
application
to
Alice
himself
,
and
he
write
to
her
,
explain
his
condition
.
<EOS>
the
election
have
come
upon
him
quite
suddenly
,
as
she
know
,
he
say
.
<EOS>
He
want
two
thousand
pound
instantly
,
and
feel
little
scruple
in
ask
her
for
it
,
as
he
be
aware
that
the
old
Squire
would
be
only
too
glad
to
saddle
the
property
with
a
legacy
to
Alice
for
the
repayment
of
this
money
,
though
he
would
not
have
advance
a
shilling
himself
for
the
purpose
of
the
election
.
<EOS>
then
he
say
a
word
or
two
as
to
his
prolong
absence
from
Queen
Anne
Street
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
there
because
he
have
feel
,
from
her
manner
when
they
last
meet
,
that
she
would
for
a
while
prefer
to
be
leave
free
from
the
unavoidable
excitement
of
such
interview
.
<EOS>
but
should
he
be
triumphant
in
his
present
contest
,
he
should
go
to
her
to
share
his
triumph
with
her
;
or
,
should
he
fail
,
he
should
go
to
her
to
console
him
in
his
failure
.
  
<EOS>
within
three
day
he
hear
from
her
,
say
that
the
money
would
be
at
once
place
to
his
credit
.
<EOS>
She
send
him
also
her
candid
good
wish
for
success
in
his
enterprise
,
but
beyond
this
her
letter
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
word
of
love
,
 
no
word
of
welcome
,
 
no
expression
of
a
desire
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
as
he
perceive
all
this
in
the
reading
of
her
note
,
feel
a
triumph

She

use
him

her
coldness

there

comfort
in
revenge

<EOS>
"
It

to
himself

<EOS>
She
should
have
marry
me
at

she
say
she
would
do
so

and
then
it
would
have
be
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Tombe
have
communicate
with
John
Grey
on
the
matter
of
this
increase
demand
,
 
this
demand
which
Mr.
Tombe
begin
to
regard
as
carry
a
love
-
affair
rather
too
far
,
 
Grey
have
telegraph
back
that
Vavasor
's
demand
for
money
,
if
make
through
Mr.
John
Vavasor
,
be
to
be
honour
to
the
extent
of
five
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tombe
raise
his
eyebrow
,
and
reflect
that
some
man
be
very
foolish
.
<EOS>
but
John
Grey
's
money
matter
be
of
such
a
nature
as
to
make
Mr.
Tombe
know
that
he
must
do
as
he
be
bidden
;
and
the
money
be
pay
to
George
Vavasor
's
account
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
Kate
nothing
of
this
.
<EOS>
why
should
he
trouble
himself
to
do
so
?
<EOS>
indeed
,
at
this
time
he
write
no
letter
to
his
sister
,
though
she
twice
send
to
him
,
know
what
his
exigency
would
be
,
and
make
further
tender
of
her
own
money
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
reply
to
these
offer
without
tell
her
that
money
have
be
forthcoming
from
that
other
quarter
,
and
so
he
leave
them
unanswered
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
the
battle
go
on
gloriously
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Travers
,
the
other
liberal
candidate
,
spend
his
money
freely
,
 
or
else
some
other
person
do
so
on
his
behalf
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Scruby
mention
this
last
alternative
to
George
Vavasor
,
George
curse
his
own
luck
in
that
he
have
never
find
such
backer
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
call
a
man
half
a
Member
when
he
be
bring
in
like
that
,
"
say
Mr.
Scruby
,
comfort
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
can
not
do
what
he
like
with
his
vote

<EOS>
He
be
not
independent
.
<EOS>
You
never
hear
of
those
fellow
get
anything
good
.
<EOS>
pay
for
the
article
yourself
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
and
then
it
be
your
own
.
<EOS>
that
be
what
I
always
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Grimes
go
to
work
strenuously
,
almost
fiercely
,
in
the
opposite
interest
,
tell
all
that
he
know
,
and
perhaps
more
than
he
know
,
of
Vavasor
's
circumstance
.
<EOS>
He
be
at
work
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
,
not
only
in
his
own
neighbourhood
,
but
among
those
man
on
the
river
bank
of
whom
he
have
speak
so
much
in
his
interview
with
Vavasor
in
Cecil
Street
.
<EOS>
the
entire
vavasorian
army
with
its
placard
be
entirely
upset
on
more
than
one
occasion
,
and
be
once
absolutely
drive
ignominiously
into
the
river
mud
.
<EOS>
and
all
this
be
do
under
the
direction
of
Mr.
Grimes
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
himself
be
pelt
with
offal
from
the
sink
tide
,
so
that
the
very
name
of
the
River
Bank
become
odious
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
who
do
not
like
to
have
his
person
touch
,
and
when
they
hustle
him
he
become
angry
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
love
you
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
"
say
Scruby
,
"
that
be
nothing
!
<EOS>
I
have
have
a
candidate
<EOS>
so
maul
,
 
<EOS>
it
be
in
the
Hamlets
,
I
think
,
 
that
there
be
not
a
spot
on
him
that
be
not
paint
with
rotten
egg
.
<EOS>
the
smell
be
something
quite
awful
.
<EOS>
but
I
bring
him
in
,
through
it
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Scruby
at
last
do
as
much
for
George
Vavasor
as
he
have
do
for
the
hero
of
the
Hamlets
.
<EOS>
at
the
close
of
the
poll
Vavasor
's
name
stand
at
the
head
by
a
considerable
majority
,
and
scruby
comfort
him
by
say
that
traver
certainly
would
not
stand
the
expense
of
a
petition
,
as
the
seat
be
to
be
hold
only
for
a
few
month
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
have
do
it
very
cheap
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
"
say
Scruby
,
"
consider
that
the
seat
be
metropolitan
.
<EOS>
I
do
say
that
you
have
do
it
cheap
.
<EOS>
another
thousand
,
or
twelve
hundred
,
will
cover
everything
 
<EOS>
say
thirteen
,
perhaps
,
at
the
outside
.
<EOS>
and
when
you
shall
have
fight
the
battle
once
again
,
you
will
have
pay
your
footing
,
and
the
fellow
will
let
you
in
almost
for
nothing
after
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
further
sum
of
thirteen
hundred
pound
be
want
at
once
,
and
then
the
whole
thing
be
to
be
repeat
over
again
in
six
month
"
time
!
<EOS>
this
be
not
consolatory
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
there
be
a
triumph
in
the
thing
itself
which
George
Vavasor
be
man
enough
to
enjoy
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
something
to
have
sit
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
though
it
should
only
have
be
for
half
a
session
.
   
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
take
His
seat
.
 
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
's
feeling
of
triumph
be
not
unjustifiable
.
<EOS>
It
be
something
to
have
sit
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
though
it
have
be
but
for
one
session
!
<EOS>
there
be
on
the
left
-
hand
side
of
our
great
national
hall
,
 
on
the
left
-
hand
side
as
one
enter
it
,
and
opposite
to
the
door
lead
to
the
Law
Courts
,
 
a
pair
of
gilded
lamp
,
with
a
door
between
them
,
near
to
which
a
privileged
old
dame
sell
her
apple
and
her
orange
solely
,
as
I
presume
,
for
the
accommodation
of
the
Members
of
the
House
and
of
the
great
policeman
who
guard
the
pass
.
<EOS>
between
those
lamp
be
the
entrance
to
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
none
but
member
may
go
that
way

<EOS>
It
be
the
only
gate
before
which
I
have
ever
stand
fill
with
envy
,
 
sorrow
to
think
that
my
step
may
never
pass
under
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
portal
forbid
to
me
,
as
there
be
many
forbid
to
all
man
;
and
forbid
fruit
,
they
say
,
be
sweet
;
but
my
lip
have
water
after
no
other
fruit
but
that
which
grow
so
high
,
within
the
sweep
of
that
great
policeman
's
truncheon
.
  
<EOS>
ah
,
my
male
friend
and
reader
,
who
earnest
thy
bread
,
perhaps
,
as
a
country
vicar
;
or
sitt
,
may
-
be
,
at
some
weary
desk
in
Somerset
House
;
or
who
,
perhaps
,
rulest
the
yard
behind
the
Cheapside
counter
,
hast
thou
never
stand
there
and
long
,
 
<EOS>
hast
thou
never
confess
,
when
stand
there
,
that
Fate
have
be
unkind
to
thee
in
deny
thee
the
one
thing
that
thou
hast
want
?
<EOS>
I
have
do
so
;
and
as
my
slow
step
have
lead
me
up
that
more
than
royal
staircase
,
to
those
passage
and
hall
which
require
the
hallowing
breath
of
century
to
give
them
the
glory
in
british
eye
which
they
shall
one
day
possess
,
I
have
tell
myself
,
in
anger
and
in
grief
,
that
to
die
and
not
to
have
win
that
right
of
way
,
though
but
for
a
session
,
 
not
to
have
pass
by
the
narrow
entrance
through
those
lamp
,
 
be
to
die
and
not
to
have
do
that
which
it
most
become
an
Englishman
to
have
achieve
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
doubtless
,
some
who
come
out
by
that
road
,
the
loss
of
whose
society
be
not
to
be
regret
.
<EOS>
England
do
not
choose
her
six
hundred
and
fifty
-
four
good
man
.
<EOS>
one
comfort
one
's
self
,
sometimes
,
with
remember
that
.
<EOS>
the
George
Vavasors
,
the
Calder
Joneses
,
and
the
Botts
be
admit
.
<EOS>
dishonesty
,
ignorance
,
and
vulgarity
do
not
close
the
gate
of
that
heaven
against
aspirant
;
and
it
be
a
consolation
to
the
ambition
of
the
poor
to
know
that
the
ambition
of
the
rich
can
attain
that
glory
by
the
strength
of
its
rich
alone
.
<EOS>
but
though
England
do
not
send
thither
none
but
her
good
man
,
the
good
of
her
Commoners
do
find
their
way
there
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
high
and
most
legitimate
pride
of
an
Englishman
to
have
the
letter
M.P.
write
after
his
name
.
<EOS>
no
selection
from
the
alphabet
,
no
doctorship
,
no
fellowship
<EOS>
,
be
it
of
ever
so
learned
or
royal
a
society
,
no
knightship
,
 
not
though
it
be
of
the
Garter
,
 
confer
so
fair
an
honour
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
be
right
when
he
declare
that
this
country
be
govern
from
between
the
wall
of
that
House
,
though
the
truth
be
almost
defile
by
the
lip
which
utter
it
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
add
that
from
thence
flow
the
water
of
the
world
's
progress
,
 
the
full
fountain
of
advance
civilization
.
  
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
,
as
he
go
in
by
the
lamp
and
the
apple
-
stall
,
under
the
guardianship
of
Mr.
Bott
,
feel
all
the
pride
of
which
I
have
be
speak
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
quite
capable
of
feel
such
pride
as
it
should
be
feel
,
 
capable
,
in
certain
dreamy
moment
,
of
look
at
the
thing
with
pure
and
almost
noble
eye
;
of
understand
the
ambition
of
serve
with
truth
so
great
a
nation
as
that
which
fate
have
make
his
own
.
<EOS>
nature
,
I
think
,
have
so
fashioned
George
Vavasor
,
that
he
may
have
be
a
good
,
and
perhaps
a
great
man
;
whereas
Mr.
Bott
have
be
bear
small
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
have
educate
himself
to
badness
with
his
eye
open
.
<EOS>
He
have
know
what
be
wrong
,
and
have
do
it
,
have
teach
himself
to
think
that
bad
thing
be
good
.
<EOS>
but
poor
Mr.
Bott
have
mean
to
do
well
,
and
think
that
he
have
do
very
well
indeed
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
tuft
-
hunter
and
a
toady
,
but
he
do
not
know
that
he
be
do
amiss
in
seek
to
rise
by
tuft
-
hunt
and
toadying
.
<EOS>
He
be
both
mean
and
vain
,
both
a
bully
and
a
coward
,
and
in
politic
<EOS>
,
I
fear
,
quite
unscrupulous
in
spite
of
his
grand
dogmas
;
but
he
believe
that
he
be
progress
in
public
life
by
the
proper
and
usual
mean
,
and
be
trouble
by
no
idea
that
he
do
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
in
those
dreamy
moment
of
which
I
have
speak
,
would
sometimes
feel
tempt
to
cut
his
throat
and
put
an
end
to
himself
,
because
he
know
that
he
have
teach
himself
amiss
.
<EOS>
again
he
would
sadly
ask
himself
whether
it
be
yet
too
late
;
always
,
however
,
answer
himself
that
it
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
even
now
,
at
this
moment
,
as
he
go
in
between
the
lamp
,
and
feel
much
of
the
honest
pride
of
which
I
have
speak
,
he
tell
himself
that
it
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
what
could
he
do
now
,
hamper
by
such
a
debt
as
that
which
he
owe
to
his
cousin
,
and
with
the
knowledge
that
it
must
be
almost
indefinitely
increase
,
unless
he
mean
to
give
up
this
seat
in
Parliament
,
which
have
cost
him
so
dearly
,
almost
before
he
have
begin
to
enjoy
it
?
<EOS>
but
his
courage
be
good
,
and
he
be
able
to
resolve
that
he
would
go
on
with
the
business
that
he
have
in
hand
,
and
play
out
his
game
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
He
have
achieve
his
seat
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
be
so
far
successful
.
<EOS>
man
who
have
ever
be
gracious
to
him
be
now
more
gracious
than
ever
,
and
they
who
have
not
hitherto
treat
him
with
courtesy
,
now
begin
to
smile
and
to
be
very
civil
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
no
doubt
,
a
great
thing
to
have
the
privilege
of
that
entrance
between
the
lamp
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
have
the
new
Member
now
in
hand
,
not
because
there
have
be
any
old
friendship
between
them
,
but
Mr.
Bott
be
on
the
look
-
out
for
follower
,
and
Vavasor
be
on
the
look
-
out
for
a
party
.
<EOS>
a
man
get
no
great
thank
for
attach
himself
to
exist
power
.
<EOS>
Our
friend
may
have
enrol
himself
among
the
general
supporter
of
the
Government
without
attract
much
attention
.
<EOS>
He
would
in
such
case
have
be
at
the
bottom
of
a
long
list
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Palliser
be
a
rise
man
,
round
whom
,
almost
without
wish
of
his
own
,
a
party
be
form
itself
.
<EOS>
if
he
come
into
power
,
 
as
come
he
must
,
accord
to
Mr.
Bott
and
many
other
,
 
then
they
who
have
acknowledge
the
new
light
before
its
brightness
have
be
declare
,
may
expect
their
reward
.
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
as
he
pass
through
the
lobby
to
the
door
of
the
House
,
lean
on
Mr.
Bott
's
arm
,
be
very
silent
.
<EOS>
He
have
speak
but
little
since
they
have
leave
their
cab
in
Palace
Yard
,
and
be
not
very
well
pleased
by
the
garrulity
of
his
companion
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
sit
among
the
first
man
of
his
nation
,
and
to
take
his
chance
of
make
himself
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
He
believe
in
his
own
ability
;
he
believe
thoroughly
in
his
own
courage
;
but
he
do
not
believe
in
his
own
conduct
.
<EOS>
He
fear
that
he
have
do
,
 
fear
still
more
strongly
that
he
would
be
drive
to
do
,
 
that
which
would
shut
man
's
ear
against
his
word
,
and
would
banish
him
from
high
place
.
<EOS>
no
man
believe
in
himself
who
know
himself
to
be
a
rascal
,
however
great
may
be
his
talent
,
or
however
high
his
pluck
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
have
hear
a
debate
?
"
say
Mr.
Bott
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
answer
Vavasor
,
who
wish
to
remain
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
many
,
probably
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
have
hear
debate
from
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
now
you
will
hear
them
from
the
body
of
the
House
,
and
you
will
find
how
very
different
it
be
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
man
can
know
what
Parliament
be
who
have
never
have
a
seat
.
<EOS>
indeed
no
one
can
thoroughly
understand
the
British
Constitution
without
it
.
<EOS>
I
feel
,
very
early
in
life
,
that
that
should
be
my
line
;
and
though
it
be
hard
work
and
no
pay
,
I
mean
to
stick
to
it
.
<EOS>
how
do
,
Thompson
?
<EOS>
You
know
Vavasor
?
<EOS>
He
be
just
return
for
the
Chelsea
Districts
,
and
I
be
take
him
up
.
<EOS>
We
shall
not
divide
to
-
night
;
shall
we
?
<EOS>
look
!
<EOS>
there
be
<EOS>
Farringcourt
just
come
out
;
he
be
listen
to
better
than
any
man
in
the
House
now
,
but
he
will
borrow
half
-
a
-
crown
from
you
if
you
will
lend
him
one
.
<EOS>
how
d'ye
do
,
my
lord
?
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
the
pleasure
of
see
you
well
?
"
<EOS>
and
Bott
bow
low
to
a
lord
who
be
hurry
through
the
lobby
as
fast
as
his
shuffling
foot
would
carry
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
course
you
know
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
however
,
do
not
know
the
lord
in
question
,
and
be
oblige
to
say
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
be
up
to
all
these
thing
?
"
say
Bott
.
  
<EOS>
"
take
the
peerage
generally
,
I
be
not
up
to
it
,
"
say
Vavasor
,
with
a
curl
on
his
lip
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
ought
to
have
know
him
.
<EOS>
that
be
Viscount
Middlesex
;
he
have
get
something
on
to
-
night
about
the
Irish
Church
.
<EOS>
His
father
be
past
ninety
,
and
he
be
over
sixty
.
<EOS>
We
will
go
in
now
;
but
let
me
give
you
one
bit
of
advice
,
my
dear
fellow
 
do
not
think
of
speak
this
session
.
<EOS>
a
member
can
do
no
good
at
that
work
till
he
have
learn
something
of
the
form
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
the
form
of
the
House
be
everything
;
upon
my
word
they
be
.
<EOS>
this
be
Mr.
Vavasor
,
the
new
Member
for
the
Chelsea
Districts
.
"
  
<EOS>
Our
friend
be
thus
introduce
to
the
doorkeeper
,
who
smile
familiarly
,
and
seem
to
wink
his
eye
.
<EOS>
then
George
Vavasor
pass
through
into
the
House
itself
,
under
the
wing
of
Mr.
Bott
.
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
as
he
walk
up
the
House
to
the
Clerk
's
table
and
take
the
oath
and
then
walk
down
again
,
feel
himself
to
be
almost
take
aback
by
the
little
notice
which
be
accord
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
he
have
expect
to
create
a
sensation
,
or
that
he
have
for
a
moment
think
on
the
subject
,
but
the
thing
which
he
be
do
be
so
great
to
him
,
that
the
total
indifference
of
those
around
him
be
a
surprise
to
him
.
<EOS>
after
he
have
take
his
seat
,
a
few
man
come
up
by
degree
and
shake
hand
with
him
;
but
it
seem
,
as
they
do
so
,
merely
because
they
be
pass
that
way
.
<EOS>
He
be
anxious
not
to
sit
next
to
Mr.
Bott
,
but
he
find
himself
unable
to
avoid
this
contiguity
.
<EOS>
that
gentleman
stick
to
him
pertinaciously
,
give
him
direction
which
,
at
the
spur
of
the
moment
,
he
hardly
know
how
not
to
obey
.
<EOS>
so
he
find
himself
sit
behind
Mr.
Palliser
,
a
little
to
the
right
,
while
Mr.
Bott
occupy
the
ear
of
the
rise
man
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
debate
in
progress
,
but
it
seem
to
Vavasor
,
as
soon
as
he
be
able
to
become
critical
,
to
be
but
a
dull
affair
,
and
yet
the
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
be
on
his
leg
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
be
watch
him
as
a
cat
watch
a
mouse
.
<EOS>
the
speaker
be
full
of
figure
,
as
become
a
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
;
and
as
every
new
budget
of
them
fall
from
him
,
Mr.
Bott
,
with
audible
whisper
,
pour
into
the
ear
of
his
chief
certain
calculation
of
his
own
,
most
of
which
go
to
prove
that
the
financier
in
office
be
altogether
wrong
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
think
that
he
could
see
that
Mr.
Palliser
be
receive
more
of
his
assistance
than
be
palatable
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
listen
,
if
he
do
listen
,
without
make
any
sign
that
he
hear
,
and
would
occasionally
shake
his
head
with
symptom
of
impatience
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Bott
be
a
man
not
to
be
repress
by
a
trifle
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Palliser
shake
his
head
he
become
more
assiduous
than
ever
,
and
when
Mr.
Palliser
slightly
move
himself
to
the
left
,
he
boldly
follow
him
.
  
<EOS>
no
general
debate
arise
on
the
subject
which
the
Minister
have
in
hand
,
and
when
he
sit
down
,
Mr.
Palliser
would
not
get
up
,
though
Mr.
Bott
counsel
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
the
matter
be
over
for
the
night
,
and
the
time
have
arrive
for
Lord
Middlesex
.
<EOS>
that
nobleman
get
upon
his
foot
,
with
a
roll
of
paper
in
his
hand
,
and
be
proceed
to
address
the
House
on
certain
matter
of
church
reform
,
with
great
energy
;
but
,
alas
,
for
him
and
for
his
feeling
!
<EOS>
before
his
energy
have
get
itself
into
full
swing
,
the
member
be
swarm
away
through
the
door
like
a
flock
of
sheep
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
get
up
and
go
,
and
be
follow
at
once
by
Mr.
Bott
,
who
succeed
in
get
hold
of
his
arm
in
the
lobby
.
<EOS>
have
not
Mr.
Palliser
be
an
even
-
temper
,
calculate
man
,
with
a
mind
and
spirit
well
under
his
command
,
he
must
have
learn
to
hate
Mr.
Bott
before
this
time
.
<EOS>
away
stream
the
member
,
but
still
the
noble
lord
go
on
speak
,
struggle
hard
to
keep
up
his
fire
as
though
no
such
exodus
be
in
process
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
little
to
console
him
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
the
paper
would
not
report
one
sentence
in
twenty
of
those
he
utter
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
no
one
would
listen
to
him
willingly
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
have
work
for
week
and
month
to
get
up
his
fact
,
and
he
be
begin
to
know
that
he
have
work
in
vain
.
<EOS>
as
he
summon
courage
to
look
round
,
he
begin
to
fear
that
some
enemy
would
count
the
House
,
and
that
all
would
be
over
.
<EOS>
He
have
give
heart
and
soul
to
this
affair
.
<EOS>
His
cry
be
not
as
Vavasor
's
cry
about
the
River
Bank
.
<EOS>
He
believe
in
his
own
subject
with
a
great
faith
,
think
that
he
could
make
man
happy
and
better
,
and
bring
them
nearer
to
their
God
.
<EOS>
I
say
that
he
have
work
for
week
and
month
.
<EOS>
I
may
have
say
that
he
have
be
all
his
life
at
this
work
.
<EOS>
though
he
shuffle
with
his
foot
when
he
walk
,
and
knock
his
word
together
when
he
talk
,
he
be
an
earnest
man
,
mean
to
do
well
,
seek
no
other
reward
for
his
work
than
the
appreciation
of
those
whom
he
desire
to
serve
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
never
to
be
his
.
<EOS>
for
him
there
be
in
store
nothing
but
disappointment
.
<EOS>
and
yet
he
will
work
on
to
the
end
,
either
in
this
House
or
in
the
other
,
labour
wearily
,
without
visible
wage
of
any
kind
,
and
,
one
may
say
,
very
sadly
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
have
be
take
to
his
long
rest
,
man
will
acknowledge
that
he
have
do
something
,
and
there
will
be
leave
on
the
mind
of
those
who
shall
remember
him
a
conviction
that
he
serve
a
good
cause
diligently
,
and
not
altogether
inefficiently
.
<EOS>
invisible
be
his
wage
,
yet
in
some
coin
be
they
pay
.
<EOS>
Invisible
be
the
thing
he
do
,
and
yet
it
be
do
.
<EOS>
let
us
hope
that
some
sense
of
this
tardy
appreciation
may
soothe
his
spirit
beyond
the
grave
.
<EOS>
on
the
present
occasion
there
be
nothing
to
soothe
his
spirit
.
<EOS>
the
Speaker
sit
,
urbane
and
courteous
,
with
his
eye
turn
towards
the
unfortunate
orator
;
but
no
other
ear
in
the
House
seem
to
listen
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
corp
of
reporter
have
dwindle
down
to
two
,
and
they
use
their
pen
very
listlessly
,
take
down
here
a
sentence
and
there
a
sentence
,
know
that
their
work
be
naught
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
sit
it
out
to
the
last
,
as
it
teach
him
a
lesson
in
those
form
of
the
House
which
Mr.
Bott
have
truly
tell
him
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
learn
.
<EOS>
and
at
last
he
do
learn
the
form
of
a
"
count
-
out
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
some
one
from
a
back
seat
muttered
something
,
which
the
Speaker
understand
;
and
that
high
officer
,
have
have
his
attention
call
to
a
fact
of
which
he
would
never
have
take
cognizance
without
such
calling
,
do
count
the
House
,
and
find
that
it
contain
but
<EOS>
twenty
-
three
Members
,
he
put
an
end
to
his
own
labour
and
to
those
of
poor
Lord
Middlesex
.
<EOS>
with
what
feeling
that
noble
lord
must
have
take
himself
home
,
and
sit
himself
down
in
his
study
,
vainly
open
a
book
before
his
eye
,
can
we
not
all
imagine
?
<EOS>
a
man
he
be
with
ample
mean
,
with
child
who
would
do
honour
to
his
name
;
one
whose
wife
believe
in
him
,
if
no
one
else
would
do
so
;
a
man
,
let
us
say
,
with
a
clear
conscience
,
to
whom
all
good
thing
have
be
give
.
<EOS>
but
of
whom
now
be
he
think
with
envy
?
<EOS>
early
on
that
same
day
Farringcourt
have
speak
in
the
House
,
 
a
man
to
whom
no
one
would
lend
a
shilling
,
whom
the
privilege
of
that
House
keep
out
of
gaol
,
whose
word
no
man
believe
;
who
be
wifeless
,
childless
,
and
unloved
.
<EOS>
but
three
hundred
man
have
hang
listen
upon
his
word
.
<EOS>
when
he
laugh
in
his
speech
,
they
laugh
;
when
he
be
indignant
against
the
Minister
,
they
sit
breathless
,
as
the
Spaniard
sit
in
the
critical
moment
of
the
bull
-
killing
.
<EOS>
whichever
way
he
turn
himself
,
he
carry
them
with
him
.
<EOS>
crowd
of
member
flock
into
the
House
from
library
and
smoking
-
room
when
it
be
know
that
this
ne'er
-
do
-
well
be
on
his
leg
.
<EOS>
the
Strangers
"
Gallery
be
fill
to
overflow
.
<EOS>
the
reporter
turn
their
rapid
page
,
work
their
finger
wearily
till
the
sweat
drop
stand
upon
their
brow
.
<EOS>
and
as
the
Premier
be
attack
with
some
special
impetus
of
redouble
irony
,
man
declare
that
he
would
be
drive
to
enrol
the
speaker
among
his
colleague
,
in
spite
of
dishonoured
bill
and
evil
report
.
<EOS>
a
man
who
could
shake
the
thunderbolt
like
that
must
be
pay
to
shake
them
on
the
right
side
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
this
man
,
and
of
his
success
,
that
Lord
Middlesex
be
envious
,
as
he
sit
,
wretched
and
respectable
,
in
his
solitary
study
!
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
have
leave
the
House
with
Mr.
Palliser
;
and
Vavasor
,
after
the
count
-
out
,
be
able
to
walk
home
by
himself
,
and
think
of
the
position
which
he
have
achieve
.
<EOS>
He
tell
himself
over
and
over
again
that
he
have
do
a
great
thing
in
obtain
that
which
he
now
possess
,
and
he
endeavour
to
teach
himself
that
the
price
he
be
pay
for
it
be
not
too
dear
.
<EOS>
but
already
there
have
come
upon
him
something
of
that
feeling
,
 
that
terribly
human
feeling
,
 
which
deprive
every
prize
that
be
gain
of
half
its
value
.
<EOS>
the
mere
have
it
rob
the
diamond
of
its
purity
,
and
mix
vile
alloy
with
the
gold
.
<EOS>
Lord
Middlesex
,
as
he
have
flounder
on
into
terrible
disaster
,
have
not
be
a
subject
to
envy
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
nothing
of
brilliance
in
the
debate
,
and
the
member
have
loom
no
large
than
ordinary
man
at
ordinary
club
.
<EOS>
the
very
doorkeeper
have
hardly
treat
them
with
respect
.
<EOS>
the
great
man
with
whose
name
the
paper
be
fill
have
sit
silent
,
gloomy
,
and
apparently
idle
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
a
fair
opportunity
be
give
them
they
escape
out
of
the
House
,
as
boy
may
escape
from
school
.
<EOS>
everybody
have
rejoice
in
the
break
-
up
of
the
evening
,
except
that
one
poor
old
lord
who
have
work
so
hard
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
have
spend
everything
that
he
have
to
become
a
Member
of
that
House
,
and
now
,
as
he
go
alone
to
his
lodging
,
he
could
not
but
ask
himself
whether
the
thing
purchase
be
worth
the
purchase
-
money
.
  
<EOS>
but
his
courage
be
still
high
.
<EOS>
though
he
be
gloomy
,
and
almost
sad
,
he
know
that
he
could
trust
himself
to
fight
out
the
battle
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
on
the
morrow
he
would
go
to
Queen
Anne
Street
,
and
would
demand
sympathy
there
from
her
who
have
profess
to
sympathize
with
him
so
strongly
in
his
political
desire
.
<EOS>
with
her
,
at
any
rate
,
the
glory
of
his
Membership
would
not
be
dim
by
any
untoward
knowledge
of
the
reality
.
<EOS>
She
have
only
see
the
play
act
from
the
box
;
and
to
her
eye
the
dress
would
still
be
of
silk
velvet
,
and
the
sword
of
bright
steel
.
   
<EOS>
a
Love
Gift
.
 
<EOS>
when
Alice
hear
of
her
cousin
's
success
,
and
understand
that
he
be
actually
Member
of
Parliament
for
the
Chelsea
Districts
,
she
resolve
that
she
would
be
triumphant
.
<EOS>
She
have
sacrifice
nearly
everything
to
her
desire
for
his
success
in
public
life
,
and
now
that
he
have
achieve
the
first
great
step
towards
that
success
,
it
would
have
be
madness
on
her
part
to
decline
her
share
in
the
ovation
.
<EOS>
if
she
could
not
rejoice
in
that
,
what
source
of
joy
would
then
be
leave
for
her
?
<EOS>
She
have
promise
to
be
his
wife
,
and
at
present
she
be
under
the
bond
of
that
promise
.
<EOS>
She
have
so
promise
because
she
have
desire
to
identify
her
interest
with
his
,
 
because
she
wish
to
share
his
risk
,
to
assist
his
struggle
,
and
to
aid
him
in
his
public
career
.
<EOS>
She
have
do
all
this
,
and
he
have
be
successful
.
<EOS>
She
strove
,
therefore
,
to
be
triumphant
on
his
behalf
,
but
she
know
that
she
be
strive
ineffectually
.
<EOS>
She
have
make
a
mistake
,
and
the
day
be
come
in
which
she
would
have
to
own
to
herself
that
she
have
do
so
in
sackcloth
,
and
to
repent
with
ashe
.
  
<EOS>
but
yet
she
struggle
to
be
triumphant
.
<EOS>
the
tiding
be
first
bring
to
her
by
her
servant
,
and
then
she
at
once
sit
down
to
write
him
a
word
or
two
of
congratulation
.
<EOS>
but
she
find
the
task
more
difficult
than
she
have
expect
,
and
she
give
it
up
.
<EOS>
She
have
write
no
word
to
him
since
the
day
on
which
he
have
leave
her
almost
in
anger
,
and
now
she
do
not
know
how
she
be
to
address
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
wait
till
he
come
,
"
she
say
,
put
away
from
her
the
paper
and
pen
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
easy
to
speak
than
to
write
.
"
<EOS>
but
she
write
to
Kate
,
and
contrive
to
put
some
note
of
triumph
into
her
letter
.
<EOS>
Kate
have
write
to
her
at
length
,
fill
her
sheet
with
a
loud
pæan
of
sincere
rejoicing
.
<EOS>
to
Kate
,
down
in
Westmoreland
,
it
have
seem
that
her
brother
have
already
do
everything
.
<EOS>
He
have
already
tie
Fortune
to
his
chariot
wheel
.
<EOS>
He
have
make
the
great
leap
,
and
have
overcome
the
only
obstacle
that
Fate
have
place
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
in
her
great
joy
she
almost
forget
whence
have
come
the
money
with
which
the
contest
have
be
win
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
enthusiastic
in
many
thing
;
 
about
herself
she
be
never
so
;
but
now
she
be
elate
with
an
enthusiasm
which
seem
to
know
no
bound
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
proud
,
"
she
say
,
in
her
letter
to
Alice
.
"
<EOS>
no
other
thing
that
he
could
have
do
would
have
make
me
so
proud
of
him
.
<EOS>
have
the
Queen
send
for
him
and
make
him
an
earl
,
it
would
have
be
as
nothing
to
this
.
<EOS>
when
I
think
that
he
have
force
his
way
into
Parliament
without
any
great
friend
,
with
nothing
to
back
him
but
his
own
wit
"
 
<EOS>
she
have
,
in
truth
,
forget
Alice
's
money
as
she
write
;
 
"
that
he
have
achieve
his
triumph
in
the
metropolis
,
among
the
most
wealthy
and
most
fastidious
of
the
rich
city
in
the
world
,
I
do
feel
proud
of
my
brother
.
<EOS>
and
,
Alice
,
I
hope
that
you
be
proud
of
your
lover
.
"
<EOS>
poor
girl
!
<EOS>
one
can
not
but
like
her
pride
,
nay
,
almost
love
her
for
it
,
though
it
be
so
sorely
misplace
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
remember
that
she
have
know
nothing
of
Messrs.
Grimes
and
Scruby
,
and
the
River
Bank
,
and
that
the
mean
have
be
want
to
her
of
learn
the
principle
upon
which
some
metropolitan
election
be
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
,
Alice
,
I
hope
that
you
be
proud
of
your
lover
!
"
<EOS>
"
He
be
not
my
lover
,
"
Alice
say
to
herself
.
"
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
be
not
.
<EOS>
He
understand
it
,
though
she
may
not
.
"
<EOS>
and
if
not
your
lover
,
Alice
Vavasor
,
what
be
he
then
to
you
?
<EOS>
and
what
be
you
to
him
,
if
not
his
love
?
<EOS>
She
be
begin
to
understand
that
she
have
put
herself
in
the
way
of
utter
destruction
;
 
that
she
have
walk
to
the
brink
of
a
precipice
,
and
that
she
must
now
topple
over
it
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
not
my
lover
,
"
she
say
;
and
then
she
sit
silent
and
moody
,
and
it
take
her
hour
to
get
her
answer
write
to
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
same
afternoon
she
see
her
father
for
a
moment
or
two
.
"
<EOS>
so
George
have
get
himself
return
,
"
he
say
,
raise
his
eyebrow
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
he
have
be
successful
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
must
be
glad
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
I
be
not
.
<EOS>
He
have
buy
a
seat
for
three
month
;
and
with
whose
money
have
he
purchase
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
let
us
always
speak
of
money
,
papa
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
when
you
discuss
the
value
of
a
thing
just
purchase
,
you
must
mention
the
price
before
you
know
whether
the
purchaser
have
do
well
or
badly
.
<EOS>
They
have
let
him
in
for
his
money
because
there
be
only
a
few
month
leave
before
the
general
election
.
<EOS>
two
thousand
pound
he
have
have
<EOS>
,
I
believe
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
if
as
much
more
be
want
for
the
next
election
he
shall
have
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
my
dear
;
 
very
well
,
if
you
choose
to
make
a
beggar
of
yourself
,
I
can
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
shall
not
complain
though
he
should
spend
all
your
money
,
if
you
do
not
marry
him
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
answer
to
this
,
Alice
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
on
that
point
her
father
's
wish
be
fast
grow
to
be
identical
with
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
fairly
what
be
my
feeling
and
my
wish
,
"
he
continue
.
<EOS>
"
nothing
,
in
my
opinion
,
would
be
so
deplorable
and
ruinous
as
such
a
marriage
.
<EOS>
You
tell
me
that
you
have
make
up
your
mind
to
take
him
,
and
I
know
well
that
nothing
that
I
can
say
will
turn
you
.
<EOS>
but
I
believe
that
when
he
have
spend
all
your
money
he
will
not
take
you
,
and
that
thus
you
will
be
save
.
<EOS>
think
as
I
do
about
him
,
you
can
hardly
expect
that
I
should
triumph
because
he
have
get
himself
into
Parliament
with
your
money
!
"
  
<EOS>
then
he
leave
her
,
and
it
seem
to
Alice
that
he
have
be
very
cruel
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
little
,
she
think
,
nay
,
nothing
of
a
father
's
loving
tenderness
in
his
word
to
her
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
speak
to
her
differently
,
may
she
not
even
now
have
confess
everything
to
him
?
<EOS>
but
herein
Alice
accuse
him
wrongfully
.
<EOS>
tenderness
from
him
on
this
subject
have
,
we
may
say
,
become
impossible
.
<EOS>
She
have
make
it
impossible
.
<EOS>
nor
could
he
tell
her
the
extent
of
his
wish
without
damage
his
own
cause
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
let
her
know
that
all
that
be
do
be
so
do
with
the
view
of
drive
her
into
John
Grey
's
arm
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
word
be
those
for
a
father
to
speak
to
a
daughter
!
<EOS>
have
she
bring
herself
to
such
a
state
that
her
own
father
desire
to
see
her
desert
and
throw
aside
?
<EOS>
and
be
it
probable
that
this
wish
of
his
should
come
to
pass
?
<EOS>
as
to
that
,
Alice
have
already
make
up
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
think
that
she
have
make
up
her
mind
that
she
would
never
become
her
cousin
's
wife
.
<EOS>
It
need
not
her
father
's
wish
to
accomplish
her
salvation
,
if
her
salvation
lie
in
be
separate
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
next
morning
George
go
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
reader
will
,
perhaps
,
remember
their
last
interview
.
<EOS>
He
have
come
to
her
after
her
letter
to
him
from
Westmoreland
,
and
have
ask
her
to
seal
their
reconciliation
with
a
kiss
;
but
she
have
refuse
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
offer
to
embrace
her
,
and
she
have
shudder
before
him
,
fear
his
touch
,
tell
him
by
sign
much
more
clear
than
any
word
,
that
she
feel
for
him
none
of
the
love
of
a
woman
.
<EOS>
then
he
have
turn
from
her
in
anger
,
declare
to
her
honestly
that
he
be
angry
.
<EOS>
since
that
he
have
borrow
her
money
,
 
have
make
two
separate
assault
upon
her
purse
,
 
and
be
now
come
to
tell
her
of
the
result
.
<EOS>
how
be
he
to
address
her
?
<EOS>
I
beg
that
it
may
be
also
remember
that
he
be
not
a
man
to
forget
the
treatment
he
have
receive
.
<EOS>
when
he
enter
the
room
,
Alice
look
at
him
,
at
first
,
almost
furtively
.
<EOS>
She
be
afraid
of
him
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
confess
that
she
already
fear
him
.
<EOS>
have
there
be
in
the
man
anything
of
lofty
principle
he
may
still
have
make
her
his
slave
,
though
I
doubt
whether
he
could
ever
again
have
force
her
to
love
him
.
<EOS>
She
look
at
him
furtively
,
and
perceive
that
the
gash
on
his
face
be
nearly
close
.
<EOS>
the
mark
of
exist
anger
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
He
have
come
to
her
intending
to
be
gentle
,
if
it
may
be
possible
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
careful
in
his
dress
,
as
though
he
wish
to
try
once
again
if
the
rôle
of
lover
may
be
within
his
reach
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
be
the
first
to
speak
.
"
<EOS>
George
,
I
be
so
glad
that
you
have
succeed
!
<EOS>
I
wish
you
joy
with
my
whole
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
,
dear
.
<EOS>
but
before
I
say
another
word
,
let
me
acknowledge
my
debt
.
<EOS>
unless
you
have
aid
me
with
your
money
,
I
could
not
have
succeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
George
!
<EOS>
pray
do
not
speak
of
that
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
rather
speak
of
it
at
once
,
and
have
do
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
think
of
it
,
you
will
know
that
I
must
speak
of
it
sooner
or
later
.
"
<EOS>
He
smile
and
look
pleasant
,
as
he
use
to
do
in
those
swiss
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
speak
and
have
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
have
trust
me
in
thus
give
me
the
command
of
your
fortune
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
believe
that
you
have
.
<EOS>
I
need
hardly
say
that
I
could
not
have
stand
for
this
last
election
without
it
;
and
I
must
try
to
make
you
understand
that
if
I
have
not
come
forward
at
this
vacancy
,
I
should
have
stand
no
chance
for
the
next
;
otherwise
,
I
should
not
have
be
justify
in
pay
so
dearly
for
a
seat
for
one
session
.
<EOS>
You
can
understand
that
;
eh
,
Alice
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
think
so
?
  
<EOS>
"
anybody
,
even
your
father
,
would
tell
you
that
;
though
,
probably
,
he
regard
my
ambition
to
be
a
Member
of
Parliament
as
a
sign
of
downright
madness
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
oblige
to
stand
now
,
if
I
intend
to
go
on
with
it
,
as
that
old
lord
die
so
inopportunely
.
<EOS>
well
,
about
the
money
!
<EOS>
It
be
quite
upon
the
card
that
I
may
be
force
to
ask
for
another
loan
when
the
autumn
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
it
,
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thanks
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
and
now
I
will
tell
you
what
I
propose
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
I
have
be
reconcile
,
 
with
a
sort
of
reconciliation
,
 
to
my
grandfather
?
<EOS>
well
,
when
the
next
affair
be
over
,
I
propose
to
tell
him
exactly
how
you
and
I
then
stand
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
go
into
that
now
,
George
.
<EOS>
It
be
enough
for
you
at
present
to
be
assure
that
such
assistance
as
I
can
give
you
be
at
your
command
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
feel
the
full
joy
of
your
success
,
and
you
will
do
so
more
thoroughly
if
you
will
banish
all
these
money
trouble
from
your
mind
for
a
while
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
shall
,
at
any
rate
,
be
banish
while
I
be
with
you
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
there
;
let
them
go
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
lift
up
his
right
hand
,
and
blow
at
the
tip
of
his
finger
.
<EOS>
"
let
them
vanish
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
always
well
to
be
rid
of
such
trouble
for
a
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
well
to
be
rid
of
them
at
any
time
,
or
at
all
time
,
if
only
they
can
be
banish
without
danger
.
<EOS>
but
when
a
man
have
overuse
his
liver
till
it
will
not
act
for
him
any
longer
,
it
be
not
well
for
him
to
resolve
that
he
will
forget
the
weakness
of
his
organ
just
as
he
sit
down
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
pretty
bit
of
acting
,
that
of
Vavasor
's
,
when
he
blow
away
his
care
;
and
,
upon
the
whole
,
I
do
not
know
that
he
could
have
do
better
.
<EOS>
but
Alice
see
through
it
,
and
he
know
that
she
do
so
.
<EOS>
the
whole
thing
be
uncomfortable
to
him
,
except
the
fact
that
he
have
the
promise
of
her
further
money
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
intend
to
rest
satisfied
with
this
.
<EOS>
He
must
extract
from
her
some
meed
of
approbation
,
some
show
of
sympathy
,
some
spark
of
affection
,
true
or
pretend
,
in
order
that
he
may
at
least
affect
to
be
satisfied
,
and
be
enable
to
speak
of
the
future
without
open
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
how
could
even
he
take
her
money
from
her
,
unless
he
may
presume
that
he
stand
with
her
upon
some
ground
that
belong
mutually
to
them
both
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
take
my
seat
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
see
that
in
the
newspaper
.
<EOS>
My
acquaintance
among
member
of
Parliament
be
very
small
,
but
I
see
that
you
be
introduce
,
as
they
call
it
,
by
one
of
the
few
man
that
I
do
know
.
<EOS>
be
Mr.
Bott
a
friend
of
yours
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
 
certainly
not
a
friend
.
<EOS>
I
may
probably
have
to
act
with
him
in
public
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
that
be
just
what
they
say
of
Mr.
Palliser
when
they
feel
ashamed
of
his
have
such
a
man
as
his
guest
.
<EOS>
I
think
if
I
be
in
public
life
I
should

that

remain

make
him

tell

Alice

would
have

have
she
dare

no

sit
silent

turn
her
face
away

be
over

lose

here

to
that
other
episode

sum
it
all
up

your
conduct

at

loss

read
your
character

can
not

reading

first

well
enough

be

young
man

in

life
do
not
read
with
sufficient
clearness
that
sweetest
morsel

poetry

when
you
quarrel
with
me

judge
somewhat
harshly
of
my
offence

I
understand
that
also

for
it
be
the
custom
of
woman
to
be
hard
in
their
judgement
on
such
sin

I
hear
that

have
accept

offer
make
to
you

gentleman

how
natural
it
be
that
you
should
seek
some
cure
for
your
wound

understand
it

accuse
myself

you

drive
you

fatal
a
remedy

round
towards
him
sharply

she
be
go
to
interrupt
him

say
nothing

he
pause
for
her
to
speak

then
he
go
on

I
understand
it
well

I
hear
that
this
cure
have
be
too
much
for
you

by
heaven
,
yes
!

there
be
no
misunderstanding

mean
no
insult
to
the
man

I
upset
his
little
toy
just
now

have
not

he
would
make

here
she
look
at
him
again
,

meet
his
eye

She
look
at
him
with
something
of
his
own
fierceness
in
her
face

she
be
prepare
herself

nothing

moment

again
go
on

<EOS>
and
,
Alice
,
I
understand
it
also
when
you
again
consent
to
be
my
wife

<EOS>
I
think
that
I
still
understand
you
then

<EOS>
I
may
have
be
vain
to
think
so
,

surely
it
be
natural

I
believe
that
the
old
love
have
come
back
upon
you

again
warm
your
heart

think
that
it
have
be
cold
during
our
separation

I
be
pleased
to
think
so

be
that
unnatural

put
yourself
in
my
place

say
if
you
would
not

think
so

I
tell
myself
that
I
understand
you
then

I
tell
myself
that
in
all
that
you
have
do
you
have
act
as
a
true
,

good
,
and
love

I
think
of
you
much

I
see
that
your
conduct
,
as
a
whole
,
be
intelligible
and
become
.

"
<EOS>
the
last
word
grate
on
Alice

ear
,

she
show
her
anger
by
the
motion
of
her
foot
upon
the
floor

cousin
note
it
all
,

go
on
as

have
not
note
it

now
your
present
behaviour
make
all
the
rest
a
riddle
.
<EOS>
You
have
say
that
you
would
be
my
wife

declare
thereby
that
you
have
forgive
my
offence
,
and
,
as
I
suppose
,
reassure
me
of
your
love
;
and
yet
you
receive
me
with
all
imaginable
coldness

<EOS>
what
be
I
to
think
of
it
,
and
in
what
way
would
you
have
me
behave
to
you
?
<EOS>
when
last
I
be
here
I
ask
you
for
a
kiss
.
"
<EOS>
as
he
say
this
he
look
at
her
with
all
his
eye
,
with
his
mouth
just
open
,
so
as
to
show
the
edge
of
his
white
tooth
,
with
the
wound
down
his
face
all
wide
and
purple
.
<EOS>
the
last
word
come
with
a
stigmatizing
hiss
from
his
lip
.
<EOS>
though
she
do
not
essay
to
speak
,
he
pause
again
,
as
if
he
be
desirous
that
she
may
realize
the
full
purport
of
such
a
request
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
,
in
the
energy
of
his
speaking
,
a
touch
of
true
passion
have
come
upon
him
;
that
he
have
forget
his
rascaldom
,
and
his
need
of
her
money
,
and
that
he
be
punish
her
with
his
whole
power
of
his
vengeance
for
the
treatment
which
he
have
receive
from
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
for
a
kiss

you
be
to
be
my
wife

can
have
no
shame

grant
me
such
a
request

within
the
last
two
month
you
have
tell
me
that
you
would
marry
me

what
be
I
to
think
of
such
a
promise
if
you
deny
me
all
customary
sign
of
your
affection

"
then
he
pause
again
,
and
she
find
that
the
time
have
come
in
which
she
must
say
something
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
you
can
not
understand
,

she
say
,

that
I
have
suffer
much
.

be
that
to
be
my
answer

answer
you

Alice
,
do
not
be
untrue

know
what
answer
I
want

whether
my
want
it
be
unreasonable

"
no

ever
tell
me
that

be
untrue

she
say

<EOS>
"

do
know
what
it
be

desire

learn
that

truth

love
me

"
  
<EOS>
She
be
stand
up
,
and
so
be
he
also
,
<EOS>
but
still
she
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
have
in
his
hand
the
little
rule
which
she
have
tell
him
that
he
may
take
,
but
he
hold
it
as
though
in
doubt
what
he
would
do
with
it
.
"
<EOS>
well

Alice

I
to
hear
anything
from
you

<EOS>
"
there
,
then

be
your
gift

say
he
,
and
he
throw
the
rule
over
on
to
the
sofa
behind
her
.

there
be
the
trumpery
trinket
which
I
have
hope
you
would
have
wear
for

"
<EOS>
Whereupon
something
which
he
have
take
from
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
be
throw
violently
into
the
fender
,
beneath
the
fire
-
grate
.
<EOS>
He
then
walk
with
quick
step
to
the
door
;
but
when
his
hand
be
on
the
handle
,
he
turn
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
he
say
,
"
when
I
be
go
,
try
to
think
honestly
of
your
conduct
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
then
he
go
,
and
she
remain
still
,
till
she
hear
the
front
door
close
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
be
sure
that
he
be
go
,
her
first
movement
be
make
in
search
of
the
trinket
.
<EOS>
I
fear
that
this
be
not
dignified
on
her
part
;
but
I
think
that
it
be
natural
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
she
have
any
desire
for
the
jewel
,
or
any
curiosity
even
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
She
would
very
much
have
prefer
that
he
should
have
bring
nothing
of
the
kind
to
her
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
a
feminine
reluctance
that
anything
of
value
should
be
destroy
without
a
purpose
.
<EOS>
so
she
take
the
shovel
,
and
poke
among
the
ashe
,
and
find
the
ring
which
her
cousin
have
throw
there
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
valuable
ring
,
bear
a
ruby
on
it
between
two
small
diamond
.
<EOS>
such
at
least
,
she
become
aware
,
have
be
its
bearing
;
but
one
of
the
side
stone
have
be
knock
out
by
the
violence
with
which
the
ring
have
be
fling
.
<EOS>
She
search
even
for
this
,
scorch
her
face
and
eye
,
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
then
she
make
up
her
mind
that
the
diamond
should
be
lose
for
ever
,
and
that
it
should
go
out
among
the
cinder
into
the
huge
dust
-
heap
of
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
better
that
,
though
it
be
distasteful
to
her
feminine
economy
,
than
the
other
alternative
of
set
the
servant
to
search
,
and
thereby
tell
them
something
of
what
have
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
when
her
search
be
over
,
she
place
the
ring
on
the
mantelpiece
;
but
she
know
that
it
would
not
do
to
leave
it
there
,
 
so
she
fold
it
up
carefully
in
a
new
sheet
of
note
-
paper
,
and
put
it
in
the
drawer
of
her
desk
.
<EOS>
after
that
she
sit
herself
down
at
the
table
to
think
what
she
would
do
;
but
her
head
be
,
in
truth
,
rack
with
pain
,
and
on
that
occasion
she
could
bring
her
thought
to
no
conclusion
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
Disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
when
Mrs.
Greenow
be
leave
alone
in
her
lodging
,
after
the
little
entertainment
which
she
have
give
to
her
two
lover
,
she
sit
herself
down
to
think
seriously
over
her
affair
.
<EOS>
there
be
three
path
open
before
her
.
<EOS>
She
may
take
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
or
she
may
take
Captain
Bellfield
 
<EOS>
or
she
may
decide
that
she
would
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
either
of
them
in
the
way
of
courting
.
<EOS>
They
be
very
persistent
,
no
doubt
;
but
she
think
that
she
would
know
how
to
make
them
understand
her
,
if
she
should
really
make
up
her
mind
that
she
would
have
neither
one
nor
the
other
.
<EOS>
She
be
go
to
leave
Norwich
after
Easter
,
and
they
know
that
such
be
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
something
have
be
say
of
her
return
to
Yarmouth
in
the
summer
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
just
woman
at
heart
,
and
justice
require
that
each
of
them
should
know
what
be
to
be
his
prospect
if
she
do
so
return
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
good
deal
to
be
say
on
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
behalf
.
<EOS>
mahogany
-
furniture
bedroom
assist
one
's
comfort
in
this
life
;
and
heap
of
manure
,
though
they
be
not
brilliant
in
romance
,
be
very
efficacious
in
farming
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
by
no
mean
despise
these
thing
;
and
as
for
the
owner
of
them
,
though
she
see
that
there
be
much
amiss
in
his
character
,
she
think
that
his
little
foible
be
of
such
a
nature
that
she
,
as
his
wife
,
or
any
other
woman
of
spirit
,
may
be
able
to
repress
them
,
if
not
to
cure
them
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
already
marry
for
money
once
,
as
she
tell
herself
very
plainly
on
this
occasion
,
and
she
think
that
she
may
now
venture
on
a
little
love
.
<EOS>
Her
marriage
for
money
have
be
altogether
successful
.
<EOS>
the
nursing
of
old
Greenow
have
not
be
very
disagreeable
to
her
,
nor
have
it
take
longer
than
she
have
anticipate
.
<EOS>
She
have
now
get
all
the
reward
that
she
have
ever
promise
herself
,
and
she
really
do
feel
grateful
to
his
memory
.
<EOS>
I
almost
think
that
among
those
plentiful
tear
some
few
drop
belong
to
sincerity
.
<EOS>
She
be
essentially
a
happy
-
tempered
woman
,
bless
with
a
good
digestion
,
who
look
back
upon
her
past
life
with
contentment
,
and
forward
to
her
future
life
with
confidence
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
be
greedy
,
she
say
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
want
more
money
,
and
therefore
she
would
have
none
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
so
far
she
resolve
,
 
resolve
also
that
,
if
possible
,
the
mahogany
-
furniture
bedroom
should
be
keep
in
the
family
,
and
make
over
to
her
niece
,
Kate
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
but
should
she
marry
for
love
;
and
if
so
,
should
captain
Bellfield
be
the
man
?
<EOS>
strange
to
say
,
his
poverty
and
his
scampishness
and
his
lie
almost
recommend
him
to
her
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
it
be
not
of
those
thing
that
she
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
woman
's
true
belief
in
her
own
power
,
and
think
that
she
could
cure
them
,
 
as
far
as
they
need
cure
.
<EOS>
as
for
his
story
about
Inkerman
,
and
his
little
debt
,
she
care
nothing
about
that
.
<EOS>
She
also
have
her
Inkermans
,
and
be
quite
aware
that
she
make
as
good
use
of
them
as
the
Captain
do
of
his
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
the
debt
,
 
what
be
a
man
to
do
who
have
not
get
any
money
?
<EOS>
She
also
have
owe
for
her
glove
and
corset
in
the
ante
-
Greenow
day
of
her
adventure
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
this
danger
,
 
that
there
may
be
more
behind
of
which
she
have
never
hear
.
<EOS>
another
Mrs.
Bellfield
be
not
impossible
;
and
what
,
if
instead
of
be
a
real
captain
at
all
,
he
should
be
a
return
ticket
-
of
-
leave
man
!
<EOS>
such
thing
have
happen
.
<EOS>
Her
chief
security
be
in
this
,
 
that
Cheesacre
have
know
the
man
for
many
year
,
and
would
certainly
have
tell
anything
against
him
that
he
do
know
.
<EOS>
under
all
these
circumstance
,
she
could
not
quite
make
up
her
mind
either
for
or
against
Captain
Bellfield
.
  
<EOS>
between
nine
and
ten
in
the
evening
,
an
hour
or
so
after
Mr.
Cheesacre
have
leave
her
,
Jeannette
bring
to
her
some
arrowroot
with
a
little
sherry
in
it
.
<EOS>
She
usually
dine
early
,
and
it
be
her
habit
to
take
a
light
repast
before
she
retire
for
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jeannette
,
"
she
say
,
as
she
stir
the
lump
of
white
sugar
in
the
bowl
,
"
I
be
afraid
those
two
gentleman
have
quarrel

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
law
,
madam
,
in
course
they
have
!
<EOS>
how
be
they
to
help
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Jeannette
,
on
these
occasion
,
be
in
the
habit
of
stand
beside
the
chair
of
her
mistress
,
and
chat
with
her
;
and
then
,
if
the
chatting
be
much
prolong
,
she
would
gradually
sink
down
upon
the
corner
of
a
chair
herself
,
 
and
then
the
two
woman
would
be
very
comfortable
together
over
the
fire
<EOS>
,
Jeannette
never
forget
that
she
be
the
servant
,
and
Mrs.
Greenow
never
forget
that
she
be
the
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
should
they
quarrel
,
Jeannette
?
<EOS>
It
be
very
foolish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
about
be
foolish
,
madam

but
it
be
the
most
natural
thing
in
life

<EOS>
if
I
have
two
beaux
as
be
a
-
court
me
together
,
in
course
I
should
expect
as
they
would
punch
each
other
's
head

<EOS>
there
be
some
girl
<EOS>
do
it
a
purpose
,
because
they
like
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
one
at
a
time
's
<EOS>
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
be
a
young
thing
,
Jeannette

"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
madam
 
<EOS>
yes
;
I
be
young
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
say
but
<EOS>
what
I
have
have
a
beau
,
young
as
I
look
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
do
not
suppose
that
I
want
beaux
,
as
you
call
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
madam
,
as
you
want

em
exactly
.
<EOS>
that
be
as
may
be
.
<EOS>
there
they
be
;
and
if
they
be
to
blow
each
other
's
brain
out
in
the
gig
to
-
night
,
I
should
not
be
a
bit
surprised
for
one
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
will
not
quiet
them
at
Oileymead
to
-
night
,
if
brandy
-
and
-
water
do
not
do
it
.
"
<EOS>
as
she
say
this
,
Jeannette
slipt
into
her
chair
,
and
hold
up
her
hand
in
token
of
the
intensity
of
her
fear
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
silly
child
,
they
be
not
go
home
together
at
all
.
<EOS>
do
not
the
captain
go
away
first
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
Captain
do
go
away
first
,
certainly
;
but
I
think
perhaps
it
be
to
get
his
pistol
and
fight
thing
ready
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
will
not
fight

Jeannette

<EOS>
gentleman
have
give
over
fighting

"
have
they
,
madam

<EOS>
that
make
it
much
easy
for
lady
,
no
doubt

<EOS>
perhaps
them
peaceable
way
will
come
down
to
such
as
us
in
time

<EOS>
It
would
be
a
comfort
,
I
know
,
to
them
as
be
quiet
give
,
like
me
.
<EOS>
I
hate
to
see
man
knock
each
other
's
head
about
,
 
I
do

<EOS>
so
Mr.
Cheesacre
and
the
Captain
will
not
fight
,
madam
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
they
will
not

you
little
fool

you

<EOS>
"
dear

dear

I
be
so
sure
we
should
have
have
the
paper
all
full
of

perhaps
one
of

stretch
upon
his
bloody
bier

<EOS>
I
wonder
which
it
would
have
be
?
<EOS>
I
always
make
up
my
mind
that
the
Captain

not

wound

any

part

it
be
his
heart

<EOS>
"
well

I
do
not

what

there
be
some

about

<EOS>
"
why
,
about
you

madam

"
  
<EOS>
"
Jeannette
,
I
wonder
how
you
can
say
such
thing
;
as
if
I
,
in
my
position
,
have
ever
say
a
word
to
encourage
either
of
them

<EOS>
You
know
it
be
not
true
,
Jeannette
,
and
you
should
not
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
Mrs.
Greenow
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eye
,
and
Jeannette
,
probably
in
token
of
contrition
,
put
her
apron
to
hers
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
,
madam
,
no
lady
could
have
behave
better
through

you
have
do

goodness
know
you
have
be
try
hard

indeed
I
have

Jeannette

if
gentleman
will
make
fool
of
themselves

it
be
not
your

be
it

<EOS>

but
I
be
so
sorry

they
should
have
quarrel

They
be
such
dear

you
know

quite
all

when
you
have
settle

it

that
will
all
come
right
again

see
that
gentlefolk
like

have
give
up
fight

as
you
say

then
there
be
a
little
pause

I
suppose
,
madam

it
will
not
be
Mr.

<EOS>
to
be
sure

he
be
a
man

well

what
be
all
that

then
it
will
be

I
be
sure

for

I
have
always
think
the
Captain

the
nice
gentleman

have
always

you

he
will
be

plainly
ask

well

get

It
be

o'clock

I
hope
I
have
not

anything
amiss

rise
from

It

Mrs.

<EOS>
"
go
down
-
stair
and
finish
your
work
,
do
;
and
then
take
yourself
off
to
bed
.
<EOS>
next
week
we
shall
have
to
be
pack
up
,
and
there
will
be
all
my
thing
to
see
to
before
that
.
"
<EOS>
so
Jeannette
get
up
and
depart
,
and
after
some
few
further
thought
about
Captain
Bellfield
,
Mrs.
Greenow
herself
go
to
her
bedroom
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
when
he
drive
back
to
Oileymead
alone
from
Norwich
,
after
dine
with
Mrs.
Greenow
,
have
keep
himself
hot
,
and
almost
comfortable
,
with
passion
against
Bellfield
;
and
his
heat
,
if
not
his
comfort
,
have
be
sustain
by
his
see
the
Captain
,
with
his
portmanteau
,
escape
just
as
he
reach
his
own
homestead
.
<EOS>
but
early
on
the
follow
morning
his
mind
revert
to
Mrs.
Greenow
,
and
he
remember
,
with
anything
but
satisfaction
,
some
of
the
hard
thing
which
she
have
say
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
make
mistake
in
his
manner
of
woo
.
<EOS>
He
be
quite
aware
of
that
now
,
and
be
determine
that
they
should
be
rectify
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
She
have
rebuke
him
for
have
say
nothing
about
his
love
.
<EOS>
He
would
instantly
mend
that
fault
.
<EOS>
and
she
have
bid
him
not
to
be
so
communicative
about
his
wealth
.
<EOS>
henceforth
he
would
be
dumb
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
could
not
but
think
that
the
knowledge
of
his
circumstance
which
the
lady
already
possess
,
must
be
of
service
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
She
can
not
really
like
a
poor
beggarly
wretch
who
have
not
get
a
shilling
,
"
he
say
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
far
from
feel
that
the
battle
be
already
lose
.
<EOS>
Her
last
word
to
him
have
be
an
assurance
of
her
friendship
;
and
then
why
should
she
have
be
at
so
much
trouble
to
tell
him
the
way
in
which
he
ought
to
address
her
if
she
be
herself
indifferent
as
to
his
address
?
<EOS>
He
be
,
no
doubt
,
become
tired
of
his
courtship
,
and
heartily
wish
that
the
work
be
over
;
but
he
be
not
minded
to
give
it
up
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
prepare
himself
for
another
attack
,
and
take
himself
into
Norwich
without
seek
counsel
from
any
one
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
trust
himself
to
think
that
she
could
really
wish
to
refuse
him
after
all
the
encouragement
she
have
give
him
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
he
put
on
no
pink
shirt
or
shiny
boot
,
be
deter
from
do
so
by
a
remembrance
of
Captain
Bellfield
's
ridicule
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
dress
himself
with
considerable
care
.
<EOS>
He
clothe
his
nether
person
in
knickerbocker
,
with
tight
,
leathern
,
bright
-
coloured
gaiter
round
his
leg
,
be
conscious
of
certain
manly
grace
and
symmetrical
proportion
which
may
,
as
he
think
,
stand
him
in
good
stead
.
<EOS>
and
he
put
on
a
new
shooting
-
coat
,
the
button
on
which
be
elaborate
,
and
a
wonderful
waistcoat
work
over
with
fox
"
head
.
<EOS>
He
complete
his
toilet
with
a
round
,
low
-
crown
hat
,
with
dog's
-
skin
glove
,
and
a
cut
whip
.
<EOS>
thus
armed
he
go
forth
resolve
to
conquer
or
to
die
,
 
as
far
as
death
may
result
from
any
wound
which
Mrs.
Greenow
may
be
able
to
give
him
.
<EOS>
He
wait
,
on
this
occasion
,
for
the
coming
of
no
market
-
day
;
indeed
,
the
journey
into
the
city
be
altogether
special
,
and
he
be
desirous
that
she
should
know
that
such
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
He
drive
at
a
great
pace
into
the
inn
-
yard
,
throw
his
rein
to
the
ostler
,
take
just
one
glass
of
cherry
-
brandy
at
the
bar
,
and
then
march
off
across
the
market
-
place
to
the
close
,
with
quiet
and
decisive
step
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
that
you
,
Cheesacre
?
"
say
a
friendly
voice
,
in
one
of
the
narrow
street
.
<EOS>
"
who
expect
to
see
you
in
Norwich
on
a
Thursday
!
<EOS>
"
It
be
Grimsby
,
the
son
of
old
Grimsby
of
Hatherwich
,
a
country
gentleman
,
and
one
,
therefore
,
to
whom
Cheesacre
would
generally
pay
much
respect
;
but
on
this
occasion
he
do
not
even
pull
up
for
an
instant
,
or
moderate
his
pace
.
"
<EOS>
a
little
bit
of
private
business
,
"
he
say
,
and
march
onwards
with
his
head
towards
the
Close
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
go
to
be
afraid
of
a
woman
 
<EOS>
not
if
I
know
it
,
"
he
say
to
himself
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
at
a
certain
pastrycook
's
,
of
whose
shop
he
have
knowledge
,
he
pull
up
and
have
another
glass
of
cherry
-
brandy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Greenow

at
home
,
"
he
say
to
Jeannette
,
not
deign
to
ask
any
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
sir
;
she
be
at
home
,
"
say
Jeannette
,
conscious
that
some
occasion
have
arrive
;
and
in
another
second
he
be
in
the
presence
of
his
angel
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
whoever
expect
to
see
you
in
Norwich
on
a
Thursday
?
"
say
the
lady
,
as
she
welcome
him
,
use
almost
the
same
word
as
his
friend
have
do
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
why
should
not
he
come
into
Norwich
on
a
Thursday
,
as
well
as
any
one
else
?
<EOS>
do
they
suppose
that
he
be
tie
for
ever
to
his
plough
and
cart
?
<EOS>
He
be
minded
to
conduct
himself
with
a
little
spirit
on
this
occasion
,
and
to
improve
the
opinion
which
Mrs.
Greenow
have
form
about
him
.
<EOS>
on
this
account
he
answer
her
somewhat
boldly
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
knowing
when
I
may
be
in
Norwich
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
or
when
I
may
not

<EOS>
I
be
one
of
those
man
of
whom
nobody
know
anything
certain
,
except
that
I
pay
as
I
go
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
he
remember
that
he
be
not
to
make
any
more
boast
about
his
money
,
and
he
endeavour
to
cover
the
error
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
one
other
thing
they
may
all
know
if
they
please
,
but
we
will
not
say
what
that
be
just
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
will
not
you
sit
down
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
 
thank
you
,
 
I
will
sit
down
for
a
few
minute

Mrs.
Greenow

I
be
in
such
a

I
must
put
an
end

it

I
shall
be
go
mad

and
do
somebody
a
damage

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
dear

<EOS>
what
have
happen
to
you

<EOS>
You
be
go
out

and
Mrs.
Greenow
look
down
at
his
garment
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
I
be
not

<EOS>
I
put
on
these
thing
because
I
think
I
may
take
a
shot
as
I
come
along
.
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
do
it
,
and
then
I
would
not
take
them
off
again
.
<EOS>
what
do
it
matter
what
a
man
wear
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
in
the
least
,
so
long
as
he
be
decent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
be
always
that
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
dear
,
yes
.
<EOS>
More
than
that
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
I
consider
you
to
be
rather
gay
in
your
attire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
pretend
to
anything
of
that
kind
,
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
I
like
to
be
nice
,
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
.
<EOS>
there
be
people
who
think
that
because
a
man
farm
his
own
land
,
he
must
be
always
in
the
muck
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
case
,
of
course
,
with
those
who
have
to
make
their
rent
and
live
out
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
then
he
remember
that
he
be
again
tread
on
forbidden
ground
,
and
stop
himself
.
"
<EOS>
but
it
do
not
matter
what
a
man
wear
if
his
heart
be
not
easy
within
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
why
you
should
speak
in
that
way
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
;
but
it
be
what
I
have
feel
every
hour
since
 
since
Greenow
leave
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
be
rather
at
a
loss
to
know
how
he
should
begin
.
<EOS>
this
allusion
to
the
depart
one
do
not
at
all
assist
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
so
often
tell
the
widow
that
care
kill
a
cat
,
and
that
a
live
dog
be
well
than
a
dead
lion
;
and
have
find
so
little
efficacy
in
the
proverb
,
that
he
do
not
care
to
revert
to
them
.
<EOS>
He
be
aware
that
some
more
decide
method
of
proceeding
be
now
require
.
<EOS>
little
hint
at
love
-
making
have
be
all
very
well
in
the
early
day
of
their
acquaintance
;
but
there
must
be
something
more
than
little
hint
before
he
could
hope
to
bring
the
matter
to
a
favourable
conclusion
.
<EOS>
the
widow
herself
have
tell
him
that
he
ought
to
talk
about
love
;
and
he
have
take
two
glass
of
cherry
-
brandy
,
hope
that
they
may
enable
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
have
put
on
a
coat
with
brilliant
button
,
and
new
knickerbocker
,
in
order
that
he
may
be
master
of
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
be
resolve
to
call
a
spade
a
spade
,
and
to
speak
boldly
of
his
passion
;
but
how
be
he
to
begin
?
<EOS>
there
be
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
seat
in
a
chair
,
and
there
he
remain
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
,
while
she
smooth
her
eyebrow
with
her
handkerchief
after
her
last
slight
ebullition
of
grief
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
he
exclaim
at
last
,
jump
up
before
her
;
"
dear
Mrs.
Greenow
;
darle
Mrs.
Greenow
,
will
you
be
my
wife
?
<EOS>
there
!
<EOS>
I
have
say
it
at
last
,
and
I
mean
it
.
<EOS>
everything
that
I
have
get
shall
be
yours
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
speak
specially
of
my
hand
and
heart
.
<EOS>
as
for
love
;
 
oh
,
Arabella
,
if
you
only
know
me
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
there
be
a
man
in
Norfolk
better
able
to
love
a
woman
than
I
be
.
<EOS>
ever
since
I
first
see
you
at
Yarmouth
,
I
have
be
in
love
to
that
extent
that
I
have
not
know
what
I
have
be
about

if
you
will
ask
them
at
home
,
they
will
tell
you
that
I
have
not

able
to
look
after
anything
about
the
place

not
as
it
should
be
do
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
really
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
I
have
open
the
wage
book
half
a
dozen
time
since
last
July

have
that

can

about
anywhere

about
you

My
mind
be
make
up
;
I
will
not
stay
at
Oileymead
unless
you
will
come
and
be
its
mistress

"
  
<EOS>
"
not

at
Oileymead

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

indeed
.
<EOS>
I
will
let
the
place

go
and
travel
somewhere

<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of
my
hang
on
there
without
the
woman
of
my
heart

<EOS>
I
could
not
do
it
,
Mrs.
Greenow
;
I
could
not
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
have
get
everything
there
that
money
can
buy
,
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
all
of
no
use
to
a
man
that
be
in
love
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
I
have
come
quite
to
despise
money
and
stock
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
have
my
banker
's
book
home
these
last
three
month
.
<EOS>
only
think
of
that
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
how
can
I
help
you
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
just
say
one
word
,
and
the
thing'll
be
do
.
<EOS>
say
you
will
be
my
wife
?
<EOS>
I
will
be
so
good
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
as
for
your
fortune
,
I
do
not
care
that
for
it
!
<EOS>
I
be
not
like
somebody
else

it
be
yourself

I
want
.

You
shall
be
my
pet

and
my
poppet

and
my
dear
little
duck
all
the
day
of
your
life

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
;
it
can
not
be

"
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
not
?
<EOS>
look
here
,
Arabella
!
"
<EOS>
at
these
word
he
rise
from
his
chair
,
and
come
immediately
before
her
,
go
down
on
both
knee
so
close
to
her
as
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
her
escape
from
him
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
efficacy
of
the
cherry
-
brandy
.
<EOS>
there
he
be
,
well
down
on
his
knee
;
but
he
have
not
get
down
so
low
without
some
little
crack
and
strain
on
the
part
of
the
gaiter
with
which
his
leg
be
encompass
.
<EOS>
He
,
in
his
passion
,
have
probably
omit
to
notice
this
;
but
Mrs.
Greenow
,
who
be
more
cool
in
her
present
temperament
,
be
painfully
aware
that
he
may
not
be
able
to
rise
with
ease
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Cheesacre

do
not
make
a
fool
of
yourself

till
you
have
tell
me
that

you
will
remain
there

Whereupon

grasp
upon

hand
be
release

he
make
no
attempt
to
rise

<EOS>
"
I
never

there
be
somebody
come

"
  
<EOS>
but
Cheesacre
,
whose
sense
be
less
acute
than
the
lady
's
,
do
not
hear
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
get
up

say
he
,
"
till
you
have
bid
me
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
bid
you
play
the

get
away
from
my
knee
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
there
;
 
he
will
be
in
the
room
now
before
 
"
  
Cheesacre
now
do
hear
a
sound
of
step
,
and
the
door
be
open
while
he
make
his
first
futile
attempt
to
get
back
to
a
stand
position
.
<EOS>
the
door
be
open
,
and
Captain
Bellfield
enter
.
<EOS>
"
I
beg
ten
thousand
pardon
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
but
as
I
do
not
see
Jeannette
,
I
venture
to
come
in
.
<EOS>
May
I
venture
to
congratulate
my
friend
Cheesacre
on
his
success
?
"
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
Cheesacre
have
rise
;
but
he
have
do
so
slowly
,
and
with
evident
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
trouble
you
to
leave
the
room
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
particularly
engage
with
Mrs.
Greenow

as
any
gentleman
may
have
see

"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
not
the
slight
difficulty
in
see
it

old
fellow

"
say
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
wish
you
joy

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
trouble
you
to
leave

room

sir

Cheesacre
,
walk
up
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
if
Mrs.
Greenow
will
desire
me
to
do
so
,
"
say
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
then
Mrs.
Greenow
feel
herself
call
upon
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
I
must
beg
that
you
will
not
make
my
drawing
-
room
a
place
for
quarrel
.
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
,
lest
there
should
be
any
misconception
,
I
must
beg
you
to
understand
that
the
position
in
which
you
find
Mr.
Cheesacre
be
one
altogether
of
his
own
seeking
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
with
my
consent
that
he
be
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
easily
believe
that
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
say
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
care
what
you
believe
,
sir

"
say
Mr.

<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
!

gentleman
!
<EOS>

really
unkind

<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield

I
think
I
have
better
ask
you
to
withdraw
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
by
all
mean
,
"
say
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
it
be
absolutely
necessary
that
I
should
give
Mr.
Cheesacre
a
definite
answer
after
what
have
occur

"
of
course
,
"
say
Captain
Bellfield
,
prepare
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
another
opportunity
of
pay
my
respect
to
you

<EOS>
perhaps
I
may
be
allow
to
come
this
evening
?
"
  
<EOS>
to
this
Mrs.
Greenow
half
assent
with
an
uncertain
nod
,
and
then
the
Captain
go
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
door
be
close
behind
his
back
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
again
prepare
to
throw
himself
into
his
former
position
,
but
to
this
Mrs.
Greenow
decidedly
object
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
allow
to
go
down
again
,
there
be
no
know
what
force
may
be
necessary
to
raise
him
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
"
she
say
,
"
let
there
be
an
end
to
this
little
farce
between
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Farce
!
"
say
he
,
stand
with
his
hand
on
his
heart
,
and
his
leg
and
knickerbocker
well
display
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
certainly
either
a
farce
or
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
if
the
latter
,
 
and
<EOS>
I
have
be
at
all
to
blame
,
 
<EOS>
I
ask
your
pardon
most
sincerely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
be
Mrs.
Cheesacre
;
will
not
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
;
no
.
<EOS>
one
husband
be
enough
for
any
woman
,
and
mine
lie
bury
at
Birmingham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
damn
it
!
"
say
he
,
in
utter
disgust
at
this
further
reference
to
Mr.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
the
expression
,
at
such
a
moment
,
militate
against
courtesy
;
but
even
Mrs.
Greenow
herself
feel
that
the
poor
man
have
be
subject
to
provocation
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
us
part
friend
,
"
say
she
,
offer
him
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
turn
his
back
upon
her
,
for
there
be
something
in
his
eye
that
he
want
to
hide
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
he
really
do
love
her
,
and
that
at
this
moment
he
would
have
take
her
,
even
though
he
have
learn
that
her
fortune
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
not
give
me
your
hand
,
"
say
she
,
"
in
token
that
there
be
no
anger
between
us

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
think
about
it
again
 
do
!
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
if
there
be
anything
you
like
to
have
change

I
will
change
it
at
once

I
will
give
up
Oileymead
altogether

you
do
not
like

so
near
the
farm

yard

<EOS>
I
will
give
up
anything

so
I
will

<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
,
if
you
only
know
how
I

my

upon
it

"
<EOS>
and
now
,
though
his
back
be
turn
,
the
whimpering
of
his
voice
tell
plainly
that
tear
be
in
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
a
little
touched
.
<EOS>
no
woman
would
feel
disposed
to
marry
a
man
simply
because
he
cry
,
and
perhaps
few
woman
would
be
less
likely
to
give
way
to
such
tenderness
than
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
She
understand
man
and
woman
too
well
,
and
have
see
too
much
both
of
the
world
's
rough
side
and
of
its
smooth
side
to
fall
into
such
a
blunder
as
that
;
but
she
be
touch
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
friend
,
"
she
say
,
put
her
hand
upon
his
arm
,
"
think
no
more
of
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"

I
can
not

think
of
it

he
,
almost
blubber
in
his
earnestness
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
no

"
say
she
,
still
touch
him
with
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
how
can
you
bring
yourself
to
care
for
an
old
woman
like
me
,
when
so
many
pretty
young
lady
would
give
their
eye
to
get
a
kind
word
from
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
any
young
lady
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
Charlie
Fairstairs
,
who
would
make
as
good
a
wife
as
any
girl
I
know

<EOS>
"
  
"
Psha
!
<EOS>
Charlie
Fairstairs
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
very
idea
of
have
such
a
bride
palm
off
upon
him
do
something
to
restore
him
to
his
manly
courage
.
  
<EOS>

my
niece

have
a

little
fortune

be
as
accomplished

good

looking

"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
nothing
to
me

Mrs.
Greenow

<EOS>
"
that
be
because
you
never
ask
her
to
be
anything

if
I
get
her
to
come
back
to
Yarmouth
next
summer
,
will
you
think
about
it
?
<EOS>
You
want
a
wife
,
and
you
could
not
do
well
if
you
search
all
England
over

It
would
be
so
pleasant
for
us
to
be
such
near
friend

not
it

<EOS>
and
again
she
put
her
hand
upon
his
arm

<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Greenow

at

much
about

kind
 
<EOS>
I
do
not

really

<EOS>
I
hardly
know
what
to
do
with
myself
;
but
I
suppose
I
would
better
go
back
to
Oileymead
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
become
so
painfully
unconscious
of
his
new
coat
and
his
knickerbocker
that
it
be
impossible
not
to
pity
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
always
hate
the

he

"
always

pass
away

You
would
be

king
there
,
if
you
would
take
Kate
for
your
queen

you
do

Mrs.
Greenow
?

shall
I
do

yes

that

<EOS>
why

I

stay
with

half
my

nurse
the
child

"

about

then
he
hesitate
,

ask
him
of

nothing

very
well
say
that
when
a
man
be
court
a

he
should

<EOS>
to
this
he
make
no
reply

but
go
forth
from
the
house
,
and
get
his
gig
,
and
drive
himself
home
to
Oileymead

think
of
his
disappointment

bitterness

night

"

Her

be
very
bad
with
a
headache

"
Jeannette
say

<EOS>
preparation
for
Lady
Monk
's
Party
.
 
<EOS>
early
in
April
,
the
Easter
recess
be
all
over
,
Lady
Monk
give
a
grand
party
in
London
.
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
's
town
house
be
in
Gloucester
Square
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
large
mansion
,
and
Lady
Monk
's
party
in
London
be
know
to
be
very
great
affair
.
<EOS>
She
usually
give
two
or
three
in
the
season
,
and
spend
a
large
portion
of
her
time
and
energy
in
so
arrange
matter
that
her
party
should
be
successful
.
<EOS>
as
this
be
her
special
line
in
life
,
a
failure
would
have
be
very
distressing
to
her
;
 
and
we
may
also
say
very
disgraceful
,
take
into
consideration
,
as
we
should
do
in
form
our
judgement
on
the
subject
,
the
very
large
sum
of
Sir
Cosmo
's
money
which
she
spend
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
but
she
seldom
do
fail
.
<EOS>
She
know
how
to
select
her
day
,
so
as
not
to
fall
foul
of
other
event
.
<EOS>
It
seldom
happen
that
people
could
not
come
to
her
because
of
a
division
which
occupy
all
the
Members
of
Parliament
,
or
that
they
be
draw
away
by
the
superior
magnitude
of
some
other
attraction
in
the
world
of
fashion
.
<EOS>
this
giving
of
party
be
her
business
,
and
she
have
learn
it
thoroughly
.
<EOS>
She
work
at
it
harder
than
most
man
work
at
their
trade
,
and
let
us
hope
that
the
profit
be
consolatory
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
generally
acknowledge
to
be
the
proper
thing
to
go
to
Lady
Monk
's
party
.
<EOS>
there
be
certain
people
who
be
ask
,
and
who
go
as
a
matter
of
course
,
 
people
who
be
by
no
mean
on
intimate
term
with
Lady
Monk
,
or
with
Sir
Cosmo
;
but
they
be
people
to
have
whom
be
the
proper
thing
,
and
they
be
people
who
understand
that
to
go
to
Lady
Monk
's
be
the
proper
thing
for
them
.
<EOS>
the
Duchess
of
St.
Bungay
be
always
there
,
though
she
hate
Lady
Monk
,
and
Lady
Monk
always
abuse
her
;
but
a
card
be
send
to
the
Duchess
in
the
same
way
as
the
Lord
Mayor
invite
a
Cabinet
Minister
to
dinner
,
even
though
the
one
man
may
believe
the
other
to
be
a
thief

<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
be
generally
there
;

<EOS>
Lady
Monk
do
not
at
all
know
why
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
be
so
favour
by
the
world
;
but
there
be
the
fact
,
and
she
bow
to
it
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
another
set
,
the
member
of
which
be
or
be
not
invite
,
accord
to
circumstance
,
at
the
time
;
and
these
be
the
people
who
be
probably
the
most
legitimate
recipient
of
Lady
Monk
's
hospitality
.
<EOS>
old
family
friend
of
her
husband
be
among
the
number
.
<EOS>
let
the
tufton
come
in
April
,
and
perhaps
again
in
May
;
then
they
will
not
feel
their
exclusion
from
that
seventh
heaven
of
glory
,
 
the
great
culminating
crush
in
July
.
<EOS>
score
of
young

party
belong
to
this
set

the
mother

Lady

sister
and
cousin

<EOS>
They
accept
so
much
of
Lady
Monk
's
good
thing
as
she
vouchsafe
them
,
and
be
thankful
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
another
lot
,
which
generally
become
,
especially
on
that
great
July
occasion
,
the
most
numerous
of
the
three
.
<EOS>
It
comprise
all
those
who
make
strong
interest
to
obtain
admittance
within
her
ladyship
's
house
,
 
who
struggle
and
fight
almost
with
tooth
and
nail
to
get
invitation
.
<EOS>
against
these
people
Lady
Monk
carry
on
an
internecine
war
.
<EOS>
have
she
not
do
so
she
would
have
be
swamp
by
them
,
and
her
success
would
have
be
at
an
end
;
but
yet
she
never
dream
of
shut
her
door
against
them
altogether
,
or
of
say
boldly
that
none
such
should
hamper
her
staircase
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
she
must
yield
,
but
her
effort
be
make
to
yield
to
as
few
as
may
be
possible
.
<EOS>
when
she
be
first
tell
by
her
factotum
in
these
operation
that
Mr.
Bott
want
to
come
,
she
positively
decline
to
have
him
.
<EOS>
when
it
be
afterwards
intimate
to
her
that
the
Duchess
of
St.
Bungay
have
make
a
point
of
it
,
she
sneer
at
the
Duchess
,
and
do
not
even
then
yield
.
<EOS>
but
when
at
last
it
be
bring
home
to
her
understanding
that
Mr.
Palliser
wish
it
,
and
that
Mr.
Palliser
probably
would
not
come
himself
unless
his
wish
be
gratify
,
she
give
way
.
<EOS>
She
be
especially
anxious
that
Lady
Glencora
should
come
to
her
gathering
,
and
she
know
that
Lady
Glencora
could
not
be
have
without
Mr.
Palliser

<EOS>
It
be
very
much
desire
by
her
that
Lady
Glencora
should
be
there

Burgo

in
Gloucester
Square

much
to
the
annoyance
of
Sir

who
have
become
heartily
tired
of
his
nephew

<EOS>
the
aunt
and
the
nephew
have
be
closet
together
more
than
once
lately
,
and
perhaps
they
understand
each
other
better
now
than
they
have
do
down
at
Monkshade
.
<EOS>
the
aunt
have
hand
a
little
note
to
Burgo
,
which
he

You

I

after
what

right
to

<EOS>
Mr.

,
in
my
mind
,
behave
very
wrongly
in
step
in
between
you
and
 
you
and
such
a
fortune
as
her
,
in
that
way

<EOS>
He
can
not
expect
that
his

should
have
any
affection
for
him

<EOS>
there
be
nobody
alive
who
have
a
great
horror
of
anything
improper
in
married
woman
than
I
have

<EOS>
I
have
always
show
it

<EOS>
when

use
her
dreadfully

there

nothing

Colonel
Graham

<EOS>
one
can
not

particular
in

<EOS>

here
,
if
you

if

succeed

you

I
shall
always

no

there

Alice

in

one
do
not

to
be
follow
everywhere
by
a
policeman

even
though
one
be
not

and
then
,
the
devil
be
so
strong
within
me
,
that
I
should
like
to
dodge
the
policeman
.
<EOS>
I
can
fancy
a
woman
be
drive
to
do
wrong
simply
by
a
desire
to
show
her
policeman
that
she
can
be
too
many
for
him

"
  
<EOS>
"
Glencora
,
you
make

wretched

Will
you
go
with
me
,
then
,
so
that
I
may
have
a

of

<EOS>
He
ask
me
if
I
would
mind
take
Mrs.
Marsham
with
me
in
my
carriage

<EOS>
so
I
up
and
speak
,
very
boldly
,
like
the
proud
young
porter

and
tell
him
I
would
not

when
he
ask
why
not

I
say
that
I
prefer
take
a

a
young
friend

I

,
and
I
then
name
you

I
should
bring
one

the
other

be
he
angry

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

he
take
it
very
quietly
,
 
say
something
,
in
his
calm
way
,
about
hope
that
I
should
get
over
a
prejudice
against
one
of
his
early
and
dear
friend

<EOS>
He
twit
at
me
because
I
do
not
understand
Parliament
and
the
British
Constitution
,
but
<EOS>
I
know
more
of
them
than
he
do
about
a
woman

<EOS>
You
be
quite
sure
you
will
not
go
,
then
?
"
<EOS>
Alice
hesitate
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
do
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
;
and
there
be
an
amount
of
persuasion
in
her
accent
which
should
,
I
think
,
have
overcome
her
cousin
's
scruple
.
  
<EOS>
"
It

against

and
,
Glencora
,
I
be
not

myself

<EOS>
I
be
not
fit
for
party

<EOS>
I
sometimes
think
that
I
shall
never
go
into
society
again

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
nonsense
,
you
know

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
be
,
but
I
can
not

now

I
would
if
I
really
think
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
oh
,
very
well
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
interrupt
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
shall
get
through
it
.
<EOS>
if
he
ask
me
to
dance
,
I
shall
stand
up
with
him
,
just
as
though
I
have
never

him
before

"
<EOS>
then
she
remember
the
letter
in
her
pocket
,
 
remember
that
at
this
moment
she
bear
about
with
her
a
write
proposition
from
this
man
to
go
off
with
him
and
leave
her
husband
's
house
.
<EOS>
She
have
intend
to
show
it
to
Alice
on
this
occasion
;
but
as
Alice
have
refuse
her
request
,
she
be
glad
that
she
have
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
come
to
me
the
morning
after
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
as
she
go
.
<EOS>
this
Alice
promise
to
do
;
and
then
she
be
leave
alone
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
regret
,
 
regret
deeply
that
she
have
not
consent
to
go
with
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
of
what
importance
have
be
her
objection
when
compare
with
the
cause
for
which
her
presence
have
be
desire
?
<EOS>
doubtless
she
would
have
be
uncomfortable
at
Lady
Monk
's
house
;
but
could
she
not
have
bear
some
hour
or
two
of
discomfort
on
her
friend
's
behalf
?
<EOS>
but
,
in
truth
,
it
be
only
after
Lady
Glencora
have
leave
her
that
she
begin
to
understand
the
subject
fully
,
and
to
feel
that
she
may
possibly
have
be
of
service
in
a
great
danger
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
too
late
now
.
<EOS>
then
she
strove
to
comfort
herself
with
the
reflection
that
a
casual
meeting
at
an
evening
party
in
London
could
not
be
perilous
in
the
same
degree
as
a
prolong
sojourn
together
in
a
country
house
.
   
<EOS>
how
Lady
Glencora
go
to
Lady
Monk
's
Party
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
's
house
in
Gloucester
Square
be
admirably
well
adapt
for
the
giving
of
party
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
large
house
,
and
seem
to
the
eye
of
guest
to
be
much
large
than
it
be
.
<EOS>
the
hall
be
spacious
,
and
the
stair
go
up
in
the
centre
,
face
you
as
you
enter
the
inner
hall
.
<EOS>
round
the
top
of
the
stair
there
be
a
broad
gallery
,
with
an
ornamented
railing
,
and
from
this
open
the
door
into
the
three
reception
-
room
.
<EOS>
there
be
two
on
the
right
,
the
large
of
which
look
out
backwards
,
and
these
two
be
connect
by
an
archway
,
as
though
make
for
fold
-
door
;
but
the
door
,
I
believe
,
never
be
there
.
<EOS>
front
the
top
of
the
staircase
there
be
a
small
room
,
look
out
backwards
,
very
prettily
furnished
,
and
much
use
by
Lady
Monk
when
alone
.
<EOS>
It
be
here
that
Burgo
have
hold
that
conference
with
his
aunt
of
which
mention
have
be
make
.
<EOS>
below
stair
there
be
the
great
dining
-
room
,
on
which
,
on
these
occasion
,
a
huge
buffet
be
erect
for
refreshment
,
 
what
I
may
call
a
masculine
buffet
,
as
it
be
attend
by
butler
and
man
in
livery
,
 
and
there
be
a
small
room
look
out
into
the
square
,
in
which
there
be
a
feminine
battery
for
the
dispensing
of
tea
and
such
like
small
good
thing
,
and
from
which
female
aid
could
be
attain
for
the
arrangement
or
mending
of
dress
in
a
further
sanctum
within
it
.
<EOS>
for
such
purpose
as
that
now
on
foot
the
house
be
most
commodious
.
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
,
on
these
occasion
,
be
move
by
a
noble
ambition
to
do
something
different
from
that
do
by
her
neighbour
in
similar
circumstance
,
and
therefore
she
never
come
forward
to
receive
her
guest
.
<EOS>
She
ensconce
herself
,
early
in
the
evening
,
in
that
room
at
the
head
of
the
stair
,
and
there
they
who
choose
to
see
her
make
their
way
up
to
her
,
and
speak
their
little
speech
.
<EOS>
They
who
think
her
to
be
a
great
woman
,
 
and
many
people
do
think
her
to
be
great
,
 
be
will
not
to
declare
that
she
never
forget
those
who
do
come
,
or
those
who
do
not
.
<EOS>
and
even
they
who
desire
to
describe
her
as
little
,
 
for
even
Lady
Monk
have
enemy
,
 
would
hint
that
though
she
never
come
out
of
the
room
,
she
would
rise
from
her
chair
and
make
a
step
towards
the
door
whenever
any
name
very
high
in
fashionable
life
greet
her
ear
.
<EOS>
so
that
a
mighty
Cabinet
Minister
,
or
a
duchess
in
great
repute
,
or
any
special
wonder
of
the
season
,
could
not
fail
of
enter
her
precinct
and
be
see
there
for
a
few
moment
.
<EOS>
It
would
,
of
course
,
happen
that
the
doorway
of
her
chamber
would
become
block
;
but
there
be
precaution
take
to
avoid
this
inconvenience
as
far
as
possible
,
and
one
man
in
livery
be
employ
to
go
backwards
and
forwards
between
his
mistress
and
the
outer
world
,
so
as
to
keep
the
thread
of
a
passage
open
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
Lady
Monk
be
in
this
way
enable
to
rest
herself
during
her
labour
,
there
be
much
in
her
night
's
work
which
be
not
altogether
exhilarate
.
<EOS>
lady
would
come
into
her
small
room
and
sit
there
by
the
hour
,
with
whom
she
have
not
the
slight
wish
to
hold
conversation
.
<EOS>
the
Duchess
of
St.
Bungay
would
always
be
there
,
 
so
that
there
be
a
special
seat
in
one
corner
of
the
room
which
be
call
the
Duchess
"
stool
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
care
a
straw
about
her
,
"
Lady
Monk
have
be
hear
to
complain
,
"
if
she
would
talk
to
anybody
.
<EOS>
but
nobody
will
talk
to
her
,
and
then
she
listen
to
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
have
be
another
word
or
two
between
Burgo
Fitzgerald
and
his
aunt
before
the
evening
come
,
a
word
or
two
in
the
speaking
of
which
she
have
find
some
difficulty
.
<EOS>
She
be
prepare
with
the
money
,
 
with
that
two
hundred
pound
for
which
he
have
ask
,
 
obtain
with
what
wile
,
and
lie
,
and
baseness
of
subterfuge
I
need
not
stop
here
to
describe
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
by
no
mean
willing
to
give
this
over
into
her
nephew
's
hand
without
security
.
<EOS>
She
be
willing
to
advance
him
this
money
;
she
have
be
willing
even
to
go
through
unusual
dirt
to
get
it
for
him
;
but
she
be
desirous
that
he
should
have
it
only
for
a
certain
purpose
.
<EOS>
how
could
she
bind
him
down
to
spend
it
as
she
would
have
it
spend
?
<EOS>
Could
she
undertake
to
hand
it
to
him
as
soon
as
Lady
Glencora
should
be
in
his
power
?
<EOS>
even
though
she
could
have
bring
herself
to
say
as
much
,
 
and
I
think
she
may
also
have
do
so
after
what
she
have
say
,
 
she
could
not
have
carry
out
such
a
plan
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
the
want
would
be
instant
,
and
the
action
must
be
rapid
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
have
no
alternative
but
to
entrust
him
with
the
bank
-
note
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
Burgo
,
"
she
say
,
"
if
I
find
that
you
deceive
me
now
,
I
will
never
trust
you
again
.
"
<EOS>
"
all
right
,
"
say
Burgo
,
as
he
barely
count
the
money
before
he
thrust
it
into
his
breast
-
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
lend
to
you
for
a
certain
purpose
,
should
you
happen
to
want
it
,
"
she
say
,
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
happen
to
want
it
very
much
,
"
he
answer
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
dare
to
say
more
;
but
as
her
nephew
turn
away
from
her
with
a
step
that
be
quite
light
in
its
gaiety
,
she
almost
feel
that
she
be
already
cozen
.
<EOS>
let
Burgo
's
trouble
be
as
heavy
as
they
may
be
,
there
be
something
to
him
ecstatic
in
the
touch
of
ready
money
which
always
cure
them
for
the
moment
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
morning
of
Lady
Monk
's
party
a
few
very
uncomfortable
word
pass
between
Mr.
Palliser
and
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
cousin
be
not
go
,
then
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
be
not
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
can
give
Mrs.
Marsham
a
seat
in
your
carriage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
impossible
,
Plantagenet
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
tell
you
that
I
have
promise
my
cousin
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
can
take
three
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
can
not
,
 
unless
you
would
like
me
to
sit
out
with
the
coachman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
this
,
 
a
tone
of
loudness
,
a
touch
of
what
he
call
to
himself
vulgarity
,
 
which
make
him
very
angry
.
<EOS>
so
he
turn
away
from
her
,
and
look
as
black
as
a
thundercloud
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
,
Plantagenet
,
"
she
go
on
,
"
that
it
be
impossible
for
three
woman
dress
to
go
out
in
one
carriage
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
would
not
like
to
see
me
afterwards
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
have
say
anything
to
Lady
Jane
when
Miss
Vavasor
refuse
.
<EOS>
I
have
ask
you
before
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
have
tell
you
that
I
like
go
with
young
woman
,
and
not
with
old
one
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Glencora
,
I
wish
you
would
not
use
such
expression
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
not
the
long
and
the
short
?
<EOS>
It
be
good
English
.
<EOS>
quite
as
good
as
Mr.
Bott
's
,
when
he
say
in
the
House
the
other
night
that
the
Government
keep
their
account
in
a
higgledy
-
piggledy
way
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
I
have
be
study
the
debate
,
and
you
should
not
be
angry
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
angry
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
speak
like
a
child
to
say
so
.
<EOS>
then
,
I
suppose
,
the
carriage
must
go
for
Mrs.
Marsham
after
it
have
take
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
shall
go
before
.
<EOS>
Jane
will
not
be
in
a
hurry
,
and
I
be
sure
I
shall
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
think
you
very
uncivil
;
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
I
tell
her
that
she
could
go
with
you
when
I
hear
that
Miss
Vavasor
be
not
to
be
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
Plantagenet
,
you
should
not
have
tell
her
so
,
and
that
be
the
long
 
;
but
I
must
not
say
that
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
this
,
if
you
give
me
any
order
I
will
obey
them
,
 
as
far
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
if
I
can
not
I
will
say
so
.
<EOS>
but
if
I
be
leave
to
go
by
my
own
judgement
,
it
be
not
fair
that
I
should
be
scold
afterwards

<EOS>
"
I
have
never

you

yes

you
have

<EOS>
You
have
tell
me
that
I
be
uncivil

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
that
she
would

you
so

then

it

what

I
do
not

two
straw
about
it

She
may
have
the
carriage
to
herself
if
she
like
,
but
she
shall
not
have
me
in
it
,
 
not
unless
I
be
order
to
go
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
her
,
and
I
will
not
pretend
to
like
her
.
<EOS>
My
belief
be
that
she
follow
me
about
to
tell
you
if
she
think
that
I
do
wrong

odious
baboon
with
the
red
bristle

the

thing

"
  
<EOS>
Plantagenet
Palliser
be
strike
wild
with
dismay
.
<EOS>
He
understand
well
who
it
be
whom
his
wife
intend
to
describe
;
but
that
she
should
have
speak
of
any
man
as
a
baboon
with
red
bristle
,
be
terrible
to
his
mind
!
<EOS>
He
be
begin
to
think
that
he
hardly
know
how
to
manage
his
wife
.
<EOS>
and
the
picture
she
have
draw
be
very
distressing
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
mother
;
neither
have
he
;
and
he
have
wish
that
Mrs.
Marsham
should
give
to
her
some
of
that
matronly
assistance
and
guidance
which
a
mother
do
give
to
her
young
married
daughter
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
too
,
as
he
know
,
that
a
word
or
two
as
to
some
socially
domestic
matter
have
filter
through
to
him
from
Mr.
Bott
,
down
at
Matching
Priory
,
but
only
in
such
a
way
as
to
enable
him
to
see
what
counsel
it
be
needful
that
he
should
give
.
<EOS>
as
for
espionage
over
his
wife
,
 
no
man
could
despise
it
more
than
he
do
!
<EOS>
no
man
would
be
less
willing
to
resort
to
it
!
<EOS>
and
now
his
wife
be
accuse
him
of
keep
spy
,
both
male
and
female
.
  
<EOS>
"
Glencora
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
again
;
and
then
he
stop
,
not
know
what
to
say
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
my
dear
,
it
be
well
you
should
know
at
once
what
I
feel
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
I
be
very
good
;
indeed
I
dare
say
I
be
bad
enough
,
but
these
people
about
me
will
not
make
me
any
better
.
<EOS>
the
duenna
do
not
make
the

lady
worth
much

<EOS>
"
  
"
duenna
!
"
<EOS>
after
that
,
Lady
Glencora
sit
herself
down
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
stand
for
some
moment
look
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
end
in
his
make
her
a
long
speech
,
in
which
he
say
a
good
deal
of
his
own
justice
and
forbearance
,
and
something
also
of
her
frivolity
and
childishness
.
<EOS>
He
tell
her
that
his
only
complaint
of
her
be
that
she
be
too
young
,
and
,
as
he
do
so
,
she
make
a
little
grimace
,
 
not
to
him
,
but
to
herself
,
as
though
say
to
herself
that
that
be
all
he
know
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
notice
it
,
or
,
if
he
do
,
his
notice
do
not
stop
his
eloquence
.
<EOS>
He
assure
her
that
he
be
far
from
keep
any
watch
over
her
,
and
declare
that
she
have
altogether
mistake
Mrs.
Marsham
's
character
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
another
little
grimace
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
somebody
have
mistake
it
bad
than
I
have
,
"
the
grimace
say
.
<EOS>
of
the
bristly
baboon
he
condescend
to
say
nothing
,
and
he
wind
up
by
give
her
a
cold
kiss
,
and
say
that
he
would
meet
her
at
Lady
Monk
's
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
evening
come
,
 
or
rather
the
night
,
 
the
carriage
go
first
for
Mrs.
Marsham
,
and
have
deposit
her
at
Lady
Monk
's
,
go
back
to
Park
Lane
for
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
then
she
have
herself
drive
to
St.
James
's
Square
,
to
pick
up
Lady
Jane
,
so
that
altogether
the
coachman
and
horse
do
not
have
a
good
time
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
would
keep
a
separate
carriage
for
her
,
"
Lady
Glencora
say
to
her
cousin
Jane
,
 
have
perceive
that
her
servant
be
not
in
a
good
humour
.
"
<EOS>
that
would
be
expensive
,
"
say
Lady
Jane
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
it
would
be
expensive
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
condescend
to
make
any
remark
as
to
the
non
-
importance
of
such
expense
to
a
man
so
wealthy
as
her
husband
,
know
that
his
wealth
be
,
in
fact
,
her
.
<EOS>
never
to
him
or
to
any
other
,
 
not
even
to
herself
,
 
have
she
hint
that
much
be
due
to
her
because
she
have
be
magnificent
as
an
heiress
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
thing
about
this
woman
that
be
not
altogether
what
a
husband
may
wish
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
softly
delicate
in
all
her
way
;
but
in
disposition
and
temper
she
be
altogether
generous
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
she
be
at
all
point
a
lady
,
but
have
Fate
so
will
it
<EOS>
she
would
have
be
a
thorough
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham
be
by
no
mean
satisfied
with
the
way
in
which
she
be
treat
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
have
care
to
go
at
all
to
Lady
Monk
's
party
<EOS>
have
she
suppose
that
she
would
have
to
make
her
entry
there
alone
.
<EOS>
with
Lady
Glencora
she
would
have
seem
to
receive
some
of
that
homage
which
would
certainly
have
be
pay
to
her
companion
.
<EOS>
the
carriage
call
,
moreover
,
before
she
be
fully
ready
,
and
the
footman
,
as
he
stand
at
the
door
to
hand
her
in
,
have
be
very
sulky
.
<EOS>
She
understand
it
all
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
Lady
Glencora
have
positively
decline
her
companionship
;
and
if
she
resolve
to
be
revenge
,
such
resolution
on
her
part
be
only
natural
.
<EOS>
when
she
reach
Lady
Monk
's
house
,
she
have
to
make
her
way
up
stair
all
alone
.
<EOS>
the
servant
call
her
Mrs.
Marsh
,
and
under
that
name
she
get
pass
on
into
the
front
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
there
she
sit
down
,
not
have
see
Lady
Monk
,
and
meditate
over
her
injury
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
past
eleven
before
Lady
Glencora
arrive
,
and
Burgo
Fitzgerald
have
begin
to
think
that
his
evil
star
intend
that
he
should
never
see
her
again
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
wickedly
baulk
at
Monkshade
,
by
what
influence
he
have
never
yet
ascertain
;
and
now
he
think
that
the
same
influence
must
be
at
work
to
keep
her
again
away
from
his
aunt
's
house
.
<EOS>
He
have
settle
in
his
mind
no
accurate
plan
of
a
campaign
;
he
have
in
his
thought
no
fix
arrangement
by
which
he
may
do
the
thing
which
he
meditate
.
<EOS>
He
have
attempt
to
make
some
such
plan
;
but
,
as
be
the
case
with
all
man
to
whom
think
be
an
unusual
operation
,
conclude
at
last
that
he
have
better
leave
it
to
the
course
of
event
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
obviously
necessary
that
he
should
see
Lady
Glencora
before
the
course
of
event
could
be
make
to
do
anything
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
write
to
her
,
make
his
proposition
in
bold
term
,
and
he
feel
that
if
she
be
utterly
decide
against
him
,
her
anger
at
his
suggestion
,
or
at
least
her
refusal
,
would
have
be
make
known
to
him
in
some
way
.
<EOS>
Silence
do
not
absolutely
give
consent
,
but
it
seem
to
show
that
consent
be
not
impossible
.
<EOS>
from
ten
o'clock
to
past
eleven
he
stand
about
on
the
staircase
of
his
aunt
's
house
,
wait
for
the
name
which
he
be
desirous
of
hearing
,
and
which
he
almost
fear
to
hear
.
<EOS>
man
speak
to
him
,
and
woman
also
,
but
he
hardly
answer
.
<EOS>
His
aunt
once
call
him
into
her
room
,
and
with
a
cautionary
frown
on
her
brow
,
bade
him
go
dance
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
look
so
dreadfully
preoccupy
,
"
she
say
to
him
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
but
he
shake
his
head
at
her
,
almost
savagely
,
and
go
away
,
and
do
not
dance
.
<EOS>
dance
!
<EOS>
how
be
he
to
dance
with
such
an
enterprise
as
that
upon
his
mind
?
<EOS>
even
to
Burgo
Fitzgerald
the
task
of
run
away
with
another
man
's
wife
have
in
it
something
which
prevent
dancing
.
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
be
old
,
and
be
able
to
regulate
her
feeling
with
more
exactness
.
<EOS>
but
Burgo
,
though
he
could
not
dance
,
go
down
into
the
dining
-
room
and
drank
.
<EOS>
He
take
a
large
beer
-
glass
full
of
champagne
and
soon
after
that
another
.
<EOS>
the
drink
do
not
flush
his
cheek
or
make
his
forehead
red
,
or
bring
out
the
sweat
-
drop
on
his
brow
,
as
it
do
with
some
man
;
but
it
add
a
peculiar
brightness
to
his
blue
eye
.
<EOS>
It
be
by
the
light
of
his
eye
that
man
know
when
Burgo
have
be
drink
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
while
he
be
still
in
the
supper
room
,
he
hear
Lady
Glencora
's
name
announce
.
<EOS>
He
have
already
see
Mr.
Palliser
come
in
and
make
his
way
<EOS>
up
-
stair
some
quarter
of
an
hour
before
;
but
as
to
that
he
be
indifferent
.
<EOS>
He
have
know
that
the
husband
be
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
when
the
long
-
expect
name
reach
his
ear
,
his
heart
seem
to
jump
within
him
.
<EOS>
what
,
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
,
should
he
do
?
<EOS>
as
he
have
resolve
that
he
would
be
do
,
 
that
something
should
be
do
,
let
it
be
what
it
may
,
 
he
hurry
to
the
dining
-
room
door
,
and
be
just
in
time
to
see
and
be
see
as
Lady
Glencora
be
pass
up
the
stair
.
<EOS>
She
be
just
above
him
as
he
get
himself
out
into
the
hall
,
so
that
he
could
not
absolutely
greet
her
with
his
hand
;
but
he
look
up
at
her
,
and
catch
her
eye
.
<EOS>
He
look
up
,
and
move
his
hand
to
her
in
token
of
salutation
.
<EOS>
She
look
down
at
him
,
and
the
expression
of
her
face
alter
visibly
as
her
glance
meet
his
.
<EOS>
She
barely
bow
to
him
,
 
with
her
eye
rather
than
with
her
head
,
but
he
flatter
himself
that
there
be
,
at
any
rate
,
no
anger
in
her
countenance
.
<EOS>
how
beautiful
he
be
as
he
gaze
up
at
her
,
lean
against
the
wall
as
he
stand
,
and
watch
her
as
she
make
her
slow
way
up
the
stair
!
<EOS>
She
feel
that
his
eye
be
on
her
,
and
where
the
stair
turn
she
could
not
restrain
herself
from
one
other
glance
.
<EOS>
as
her
eye
fall
on
his
again
,
his
mouth
open
,
and
she
fancy
that
she
could
hear
the
faint
sigh
that
he
utter
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
glorious
mouth
,
such
as
the
old
sculptor
give
to
their
marble
god
!
<EOS>
and
Burgo
,
if
it
be
so
that
he
have
not
heart
enough
to
love
truly
,
could
look
as
though
he
love
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
him
deceit
,
 
or
what
man
call
act
.
<EOS>
the
expression
come
to
him
naturally
,
though
it
express
so
much
more
than
there
be
within
;
as
strong
word
come
to
some
man
who
have
no
knowledge
that
they
be
speak
strongly
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
Burgo
Fitzgerald
look
as
though
it
be
possible
that
he
may
die
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
be
meet
at
the
top
of
the
stair
by
Lady
Monk
,
who
come
out
to
her
,
almost
into
the
gallery
,
with
her
sweetest
smile
,
 
so
that
the
newly
-
arrive
guest
,
of
course
,
enter
into
the
small
room
.
<EOS>
there
sit
the
Duchess
of
St.
Bungay
on
her
stool
in
the
corner
,
and
there
,
next
to
the
Duchess
,
but
at
the
moment
engage
in
no
conversation
,
stand
Mr.
Bott
.
<EOS>
there
be
another
lady
there
,
who
stand
very
high
in
the
world
,
and
whom
Lady
Monk
be
very
glad
to
welcome
 
the
young
Marchioness
of
Hartletop
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
slight
mourning
;
for
her
father
-
in
-
law
,
the
late
Marquis
,
have
die
no
t
yet
quite
six
month
since
.
<EOS>
very
beautiful
she
be
,
and
one
whose
presence
at
their
house
lady
and
gentleman
prize
alike
.
<EOS>
She
never
say
silly
thing
,
like
the
Duchess
,
never
be
troublesome
as
to
people
's
conduct
to
her
,
be
always
gracious
,
yet
be
never
lead
away
into
intimacy
,
be
without
peer
the
best
-
dress
woman
in
London
,
and
yet
give
herself
no
air
;
 
<EOS>
and
then
she
be
so
exquisitely
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Her
smile
be
lovelines
itself
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
indeed
,
people
who
say
that
it
mean
nothing
;
but
then
,
what
should
the
smile
of
a
young
married
woman
mean
?
<EOS>
She
have
not
be
bear
in
the
purple
,
like
Lady
Glencora
,
her
father
be
a
country
clergyman
who
have
never
reach
a
high
grade
than
that
of
an
archdeacon
;
but
she
know
the
way
of
high
life
,
and
what
an
exigeant
husband
would
demand
of
her
,
much
well
than
poor
Glencora
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
speak
of
no
man
as
a
baboon
with
a
bristly
beard
.
<EOS>
She
never
talk
of
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
wander
out
o
'
night
in
winter
among
the
ruin
.
<EOS>
She
make
no
fast
friendship
with
lady
whom
her
lord
do
not
like
.
<EOS>
She
have
once
,
indeed
,
be
approach
by
a
lover
since
she
have
be
marry
,
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
himself
have
be
the
offender
,
 
<EOS>
but
she
have
turn
the
affair
to
infinite
credit
and
profit
,
have
gain
her
husband
's
close
confidence
by
tell
him
of
it
all
,
have
yet
not
bring
on
any
hostile
collision
,
and
have
even
dismiss
her
lover
without
annoy
him
.
<EOS>
but
then
Lady
Hartletop
be
a
miracle
of
a
woman
!
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
be
no
miracle
.
<EOS>
though
bear
in
the
purple
,
she
be
make
of
ordinary
flesh
and
blood
,
and
as
she
enter
Lady
Monk
's
little
room
,
hardly
know
how
to
recover
herself
sufficiently
for
the
purpose
of
ordinary
conversation

Dear
Lady
Glencora
,
do
come
in
for
a
moment
to
my
den
.
<EOS>
We
be
so
sorry
not
to
have
you
at
Monkshade
.
<EOS>
We
hear
such
terrible
thing
about
your
health
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
say
that
it
be
only
a
cold
,
 
a
bad
cold
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
;
we
hear
,
 
something
about
moonlight
and
ruin
.
<EOS>
so
like
you
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
love
that
sort
of
thing
,
above
all
people
;
but
it
do
not
do
;
do
it
?
<EOS>
circumstance
be
so
exacting
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
know
Lady
Hartletop
;
 
and
there
be
the
Duchess
of
St.
Bungay
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
be
here
five
minute
since
.
"
<EOS>
then
Lady
Monk
be
oblige
to
get
to
her
door
again
and
Lady
Glencora
find
herself
stand
close
to
Lady
Hartletop
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
see
Mr.
Palliser
just
pass
through
,
"
say
Lady
Hartletop
,
who
be
able
to
meet
and
speak
of
the
man
who
have
dare
to
approach
her
with
his
love
,
without
the
slight
nervousness
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
he
say
he
should
be
here
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
great
crowd
,
"
say
Lady
Hartletop
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
London
be
so
full
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
great
.
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
and
<EOS>
then
they
have
say
to
each
other
all
that
society
require
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
as
we
know
,
could
talk
with
imprudent
vehemence
by
the
hour
together
if
she
like
her
companion
;
but
the
other
lady
seldom
commit
herself
by
more
word
than
she
have
utter
now
,
 
unless
it
be
to
her
tirewoman
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
very
well
you
be
look
,
"
say
the
Duchess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
hear
you
have
be
so
ill
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
that
midnight
escapade
among
the
ruin
it
be
fate
that
Lady
Glencora
should
never
hear
the
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
d'ye
do
,
Lady
Glencowrer
?
"
sound
in
her
ear
,
and
there
be
a
great
red
paw
stick
out
for
her
to
take
.
<EOS>
but
after
what
have
pass
between
Lady
Glencora
and
her
husband
to
-
day
about
Mr.
Bott
,
she
be
determine
that
she
would
not
take
Mr.
Bott
's
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
you
,
Mr.
Bott
?
<EOS>
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
will
look
for
Mr.
Palliser
in
the
back
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Lady
Glencora
,
"
whisper
the
Duchess
,
in
an
ecstasy
of
agony
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
turn
and
bow
her
head
to
her
stout
friend
.
<EOS>
"
do
let
me
go
away
with
you
.
<EOS>
there
be
that
woman
,
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
,
come
,
and
you
know
how
I
hate
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
take
the
Duchess
under
her
wing
,
and
they
pass
into
the
large
room
together
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
I
think
,
more
than
probable
that
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
have
be
bring
in
by
Lady
Monk
as
the
only
way
of
remove
the
Duchess
from
her
stool
.
  
<EOS>
just
within
the
dancing
-
room
Lady
Glencora
find
her
husband
,
stand
in
a
corner
,
look
as
though
he
be
make
calculation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
away
,
"
say
he
,
come
up
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
only
just
come
because
I
say
I
would
.
<EOS>
Shall
you
be
late
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
;
I
suppose
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
you
dance
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
once
,
 
just
to
show
that
I
be
not
an
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
heat
yourself
.
<EOS>
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
he
go
,
and
in
the
crush
of
the
doorway
he
pass
Burgo
Fitzgerald
,
whose
eye
be
intently
fix
upon
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
look
at
Burgo
,
and
some
thought
of
that
young
man
's
former
hope
flash
across
his
mind
,
 
some
remembrance
,
too
,
of
a
caution
that
have
be
whisper
to
him
;
but
for
no
moment
do
a
suspicion
come
to
him
that
he
ought
to
stop
and
watch
by
his
wife
.
   
<EOS>
how
Lady
Glencora
come
back
from
Lady
Monk
's
Party
.
 
<EOS>
Burgo
Fitzgerald
remain
for
a
minute
or
two
lean
where
we
last
see
him
,
 
against
the
dining
-
room
wall
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
;
and
as
he
do
so
some
thought
that
be
almost
solemn
pass
across
his
mind
,
this
thing
that
he
be
about
to
do
,
or
to
attempt
,
 
be
it
in
itself
a
good
thing
,
and
would
it
be
good
for
her
whom
he
pretend
to
love
?
<EOS>
what
would
be
her
future
if
she
consent
now
to
go
with
him
,
and
to
divide
herself
from
her
husband
?
<EOS>
of
his
own
future
he
think
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
do
so
.
<EOS>
even
when
he
have
first
find
himself
attract
by
the
reputation
of
her
wealth
,
he
can
not
be
say
to
have
look
forward
in
any
prudential
way
to
come
year
.
<EOS>
His
desire
to
put
himself
in
possession
of
so
magnificent
a
fortune
have
simply
prompt
him
,
as
he
may
have
be
prompt
to
play
for
a
high
stake
at
a
gaming
-
table
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
during
these
moment
,
he
do
think
a
little
of
her
.
<EOS>
Would
she
be
happy
,
simply
because
he
love
her
,
when
all
woman
should
cease
to
acknowledge
her
;
when
man
would
regard
her
as
one
degraded
and
dishonour
;
when
society
should
be
close
against
her
;
when
she
would
be
drive
to
live
loudly
because
the
softness
and
grace
of
quiet
life
would
be
deny
to
her
?
<EOS>
Burgo
know
well
what
must
be
the
nature
of
such
a
woman
's
life
in
such
circumstance
.
<EOS>
Would
Glencora
be
happy
with
him
while
live
such
a
life
simply
because
he
love
her
?
<EOS>
and
,
under
such
circumstance
,
be
it
likely
that
he
would
continue
to
love
her
?
<EOS>
do
he
not
know
himself
to
be
the
most
inconstant
of
man
,
and
the
least
trustworthy
?
<EOS>
lean
thus
against
the
wall
at
the
bottom
of
the
stair
he
do
ask
himself
all
these
question
with
something
of
true
feeling
about
his
heart
,
and
almost
persuade
himself
that
he
have
better
take
his
hat
and
wander
forth
anywhere
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
It
matter
little
what
may
become
of
himself
.
<EOS>
if
he
could
drink
himself
out
of
the
world
,
it
may
be
an
end
of
thing
that
would
be
not
altogether
undesirable
.
  
<EOS>
but
then
the
remembrance
of
his
aunt
's
two
hundred
pound
come
upon
him
,
<EOS>
which
money
he
even
now
have
about
him
on
his
person
,
and
a
certain
idea
of
honour
tell
him
that
he
be
bind
to
do
that
for
which
the
money
have
be
give
to
him
.
<EOS>
as
to
tell
his
aunt
that
he
have
change
his
mind
,
and
,
therefore
,
refund
the
money
 
<EOS>
no
such
thought
as
that
be
possible
to
him
!
<EOS>
to
give
back
two
hundred
pound
entire
,
 
two
hundred
pound
which
be
already
within
his
clutch
,
be
not
within
the
compass
of
Burgo
's
generosity
.
<EOS>
remember
the
cash
,
he
tell
himself
that
hesitation
be
no
longer
possible
to
him
.
<EOS>
so
he
gather
himself
up
,
stretch
his
hand
over
his
head
,
utter
a
sigh
that
be
audible
to
all
around
him
,
and
take
himself
up
-
stair
.
  
<EOS>
He
look
in
at
his
aunt
's
room
,
and
then
he
see
her
and
be
see
by
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
Burgo
,
"
she
say
,
with
her
sweetest
smile
,
"
have
you
be
dance
?
"
<EOS>
He
turn
away
from
her
without
answer
her
,
mutter
something
between
his
tooth
about
a
cold
-
blooded
Jezebel
,
 
which
,
if
she
have
hear
it
,
would
have
make
her
think
him
the
most
ungrateful
of
man
.
<EOS>
but
she
do
not
hear
him
,
and
smile
still
as
he
go
away
,
say
something
to
Mrs.
Conway
Sparkes
as
to
the
great
change
for
the
well
which
have
take
place
in
her
nephew
's
conduct
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
knowing
who
may
not
reform
,
"
say
Mrs.
Sparkes
,
with
an
emphasis
which
seem
to
Lady
Monk
to
be
almost
uncourteous
.
  
<EOS>
Burgo
make
his
way
first
into
the
front
room
and
then
into
the
large
room
where
the
dancing
be
in
progress
,
and
there
he
see
Lady
Glencora
stand
up
in
a
quadrille
with
the
Marquis
of
Hartletop
.
<EOS>
Lord
Hartletop
be
a
man
not
much
more
give
to
conversation
than
his
wife
,
and
Lady
Glencora
seem
to
go
through
her
work
with
very
little
gratification
either
in
the
dancing
or
in
the
society
of
her
partner
.
<EOS>
She
be
simply
stand
up
to
dance
,
because
,
as
she
have
tell
Mr.
Palliser
,
lady
of
her
age
generally
do
stand
up
on
such
occasion
.
<EOS>
Burgo
watch
her
as
she
cross
and
re
-
cross
the
room
,
and
at
last
she
be
aware
of
his
presence
.
<EOS>
It
make
no
change
in
her
,
except
that
she
become
even
somewhat
less
animated
than
she
have
be
before
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
seem
to
see
him
,
nor
would
she
allow
herself
to
be
drive
into
a
pretence
of
a
conversation
with
her
partner
because
he
be
there
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
up
to
her
at
once
,
and
ask
her
to
waltz
,
"
Burgo
say
to
himself
,
as
soon
as
the
last
figure
of
the
quadrille
be
in
action
.
<EOS>
"
why
should
I
not
ask
her
as
well
as
any
other
woman
?
"
<EOS>
then
the
music
cease
,
and
after
a
minute
's
interval
Lord
Hartletop
take
away
his
partner
on
his
arm
into
another
room
.
<EOS>
Burgo
,
who
have
be
stand
near
the
door
,
follow
them
at
once
.
<EOS>
the
crowd
be
great
,
so
that
he
could
not
get
near
them
or
even
keep
them
in
sight
,
but
he
be
aware
of
the
way
in
which
they
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
five
minute
after
this
when
he
again
see
her
,
and
then
she
be
seat
on
a
cane
bench
in
the
gallery
,
and
an
old
woman
be
stand
close
to
her
,
talk
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
Mrs.
Marsham
caution
her
against
some
petty
imprudence
,
and
Lady
Glencora
be
tell
that
lady
that
she
need
no
such
advice
,
in
word
almost
as
curt
as
those
I
have
use
.
<EOS>
Lord
Hartletop
have
leave
her
,
feel
that
,
as
far
as
that
be
concern
,
he
have
do
his
duty
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
Burgo
know
nothing
of
Mrs.
Marsham
,
 
have
never
see
her
before
,
and
be
quite
unaware
that
she
have
any
special
connection
with
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
,
he
think
,
to
find
Lady
Glencora
in
a
well
position
for
his
purpose
,
so
he
make
his
way
up
to
her
through
the
crowd
,
and
mutter
some
slight
inaudible
word
,
offer
her
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
will
do
very
well
thank
you
,
Mrs.
Marsham
,
"
Lady
Glencora
say
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
"
pray
,
do
not
trouble
yourself
,
"
and
then
she
give
her
hand
to
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham
,
though
unknown
to
him
,
know
with
quite
sufficient
accuracy
who
he
be
,
and
all
his
history
,
as
far
as
it
concern
her
friend
's
wife
.
<EOS>
She
have
learn
the
whole
story
of
the
love
of
Burgo
and
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
though
Mr.
Palliser
have
never
mention
that
man
's
name
to
her
,
she
be
well
aware
that
her
duty
as
a
duenna
would
make
it
expedient
that
she
should
keep
a
doubly
wary
eye
upon
him
<EOS>
should
he
come
near
the
sheepfold
.
<EOS>
and
there
he
be
,
close
to
them
,
almost
lean
over
them
,
with
the
hand
of
his
late
lady
love
,
 
the
hand
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
wife
,
 
within
his
own
!
<EOS>
how
Lady
Glencora
may
have
carry
herself
at
this
moment
have
Mrs.
Marsham
not
be
there
,
it
be
bootless
now
to
surmise
;
but
it
may
be
well
understand
that
under
Mrs.
Marsham
's
immediate
eye
all
her
resolution
would
be
in
Burgo
's
favour
.
<EOS>
She
look
at
him
softly
and
kindly
,
and
though
she
utter
no
articulate
word
,
her
countenance
seem
to
show
that
the
meeting
be
not
unpleasant
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
waltz
?
<EOS>
"
say
Burgo
,
 
ask
it
not
at
all
as
though
it
be
a
special
favour
,
 
ask
it
exactly
as
he
may
have
do
<EOS>
have
they
be
in
the
habit
of
dance
with
each
other
every
other
night
for
the
last
three
month
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
Lady
Glencora
will
waltz
to
-
night
,
"
say
Mrs.
Marsham
,
very
stiffly
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
do
not
know
her
business
as
a
duenna
,
or
else
the
enormity
of
Burgo
's
proposition
have
strike
her
so
forcibly
as
to
take
away
from
her
all
her
presence
of
mind
.
<EOS>
otherwise
,
she
must
have
be
aware
that
such
an
answer
from
her
would
surely
drive
her
friend
's
wife
into
open
hostility
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
not
,
Mrs.
Marsham
?
"
say
Lady
Glencora
rise
from
her
seat
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
should
not
I
waltz
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
I
rather
think
I
shall
,
the
more
especially
as
Mr.
Fitzgerald
waltz
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
thereupon
she
put
her
hand
upon
Burgo
's
arm
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham
make
still
a
little
effort
,
 
a
little
effort
that
be
probably
involuntary
.
<EOS>
She
put
out
her
hand
,
and
lay
it
on
Lady
Glencora
's
left
shoulder
,
look
into
her
face
as
she
do
so
with
all
the
severity
of
caution
of
which
she
be
mistress
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
shake
her
duenna
off
angrily
.
<EOS>
whether
she
would
put
her
fate
into
the
hand
of
this
man
who
be
now
touch
her
,
or
whether
she
would
not
,
she
have
not
as
yet
decide
;
but
of
this
she
be
very
sure
,
that
nothing
say
or
do

<EOS>
some
whisper
have
come
to
her
that

,
as

,
the
woman
whom
he

<EOS>
there
be
a
rumour
about
that
he
still
have
some
hope
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham
have
never
believe
that
Mr.
Palliser
's
wife
would
really
be
false
to
her
vow
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
fear
of
any
such
catastrophe
as
a
positive
elopement
that
she
have
take
upon
herself
the
duty
of
duenna
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
would
,
no
doubt
,
require
to
be
press
down
into
that
decent
mould
which
it
would
become
the
wife
of
a
Mr.
Palliser
to
assume
as
her
form
;
and
this
press
down
,
and
<EOS>
this
moulding
,
Mrs.

think
that
she
could
accomplish
.
<EOS>
It
have
not
hitherto
occur
to
her
that
she
may
be
require
to
guard
Mr.
Palliser
from
positive
dishonour
;
but
now
 
now
she

know
what
to
think
about
it
.
<EOS>
what
should
she
do
?
<EOS>
to
whom
should
she
go
?
<EOS>
and
then
she
see
Mr.
Bott
loom
large
before
her
on
the
top
of
the
staircase
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
Lady

off
towards
the
dancer
,
lean
on
Burgo
's
arm
.
<EOS>
"
who
be
that
woman
?
"
say
Burgo
.
<EOS>
They
be
the
first
word
he
speak
to
her
,
though
since
he
have
last
see
her
he
have
write
to
her
that
letter
which
even
now
she
carry
about
her
.
<EOS>
His
voice
in
her
ear
sound
as
it
use

when
their
intimacy
have
be
close
,
and
question
such
as
that
he
have
ask
be
common
between
them
.
<EOS>
and
her
answer
be
of
the
same
nature
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
such
an
odious
woman
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
Her
name
be
Mrs.

;
she
be
my
bête
noire
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
they
be
actually
dance
,
whirl
round
the
room
together
,
before
a
word
have
be
say
of
that
which
be
Burgo
's
settled
purpose
,
and
which
at
some
moment
be
her
settle
purpose
also
.
  
<EOS>
Burgo
waltz
excellently
,
and
in
old
day
,
before
her
marriage
,
Lady
Glencora
have
be
passionately
fond
of
dance
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
give
herself
up
to
it
now
as
though
the
old
day
have
come
back
to
her
.
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
,
creep
to
the
intermediate
door
between
her
den
and
the
dancing
-
room
,
look
in
on
them
,
and
then
creep
back
again
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham
and
Mr.
Bott
stand
together
just
inside
the
other
door
,
near
to
the
staircase
,
look
on
also
 
in
horror
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
should
not
have
go
away
and
leave
her
,
"
say
Mr.
Bott
,
almost
hoarsely
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
who
could
have
think
it
?
"
say
Mrs.
Marsham
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
do
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
would
better
tell
him
?
"
say
Mr.
Bott
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
not
know
where
to
find
him
,
"
say
Mrs.
Marsham
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
now
at
once
,
"
say
Mr.
Bott
;
 
and
then
he
add
,
"
do
you
think
it
be
as
bad
as
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
to
think
,
"
say
Mrs.
Marsham
.
  
<EOS>
the
waltzer
go
on
till
they
be
stop
by
want
of
breath
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
much
out
of
practice
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
;
"
I
do
not
think
 
I
should
have
be
able
 
to
dance
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
she
put
up
her
face
,
and
slightly
open
her
mouth
,
and
stretch
her
nostril
,
 
as
lady
do
as
well
as
horse
when
the
running
have
be
severe
and
they
want
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
take
another
turn
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
presently
,
"
say
she
,
begin
to
have
some
thought
in
her
mind
as
to
whether
Mrs.
Marsham
be
watch
her
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
a
little
pause
,
after
which
he
speak
in
an
altered
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
it
put
you
in
mind
of
old
day
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
,
of
course
,
necessary
for
him
that
he
should
bring
her
to
some
thought
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
very
sweet
,
that
dance
with
her
,
as
they
use
to
dance
,
without
any
question
as
to
the
reason
why
it
be
so
;
that
sudden
fall
into
the
old
habit
,
as
though
everything
between
this
night
and
the
former
night
have
be
a
dream
;
but
this
would
not
further
his
view
.
<EOS>
the
opportunity
have
come
to
him
which
he
must
use
,
if
he
intend
ever
to
use
such
opportunity
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
two
hundred
pound
in
his
pocket
,
which
he
do
not
intend
to
give
back
.
<EOS>
"
do
it
put
you
in
mind
of
"
old
day
?
"
<EOS>
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
the
word
rouse
her
from
her
sleep
at
once
,
and
dissipate
her
dream
.
<EOS>
the
fact
all
rush
upon
her
in
an
instant
;
the
letter
in
her
pocket
;
the
request
which
she
have
make
to
Alice
,
that
Alice
may
be
induce
to
guard
her
from
this
danger
;
the
word
which
her
husband
have
speak
to
her
in
the
morning
,
and
her
anger
against
him
in
that
he
have
subject
her
to
the
eye
of
a
Mrs.
Marsham
;
her
own
unsettled
mind
 
quite
unsettled
whether
it
would
be
good
for
her
to
go
or
to
stay
!
<EOS>
It
all
come
upon
her
now
at
the
first
word
of
tenderness
which
Burgo
speak
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
often
be
say
of
woman
that
she
who
doubt
be
lose
,
 
so
often
that
they
who
say
it
now
,
say
it
simply
because
other
have
say
it
before
them
,
never
think
whether
or
no
there
be
any
truth
in
the
proverb
.
<EOS>
but
they
who
have
say
so
,
think
of
their
word
as
they
be
uttered
,
have
know
but
little
of
woman
.
<EOS>
woman
doubt
every
day
,
who
solve
their
doubt
at
last
on
the
right
side
,
drive
to
do
so
,
some
by
fear
,
more
by
conscience
,
but
most
of
them
by
that
half
-
prudential
,
half
-
unconscious
knowledge
of
what
be
fitting
,
useful
,
and
good
under
the
cirumstance
,
which
rarely
desert
either
man
or
woman
till
they
have
bring
themselves
to
the
Burgo
Fitzgerald
state
of
recklessness
.
<EOS>
man
when
they
have
fall
even
to
that
,
will
still
keep
up
some
outward
show
towards
the
world
;
but
woman
in
this
condition
defy
the
world
,
and
declare
themselves
to
be
child
of
perdition
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
be
doubt
sorely
;
but
,
though
doubt
,
she
be
not
as
yet
lose
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
it
put
you
in
mind
of
old
day
?
"
say
Burgo
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
drive
to
answer
,
and
she
know
that
much
would
be
decide
by
the
way
in
which
she
may
now
speak
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
talk
of
that
,
"
she
say
,
very
softly
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
not
?
"
<EOS>
and
now
his
tongue
be
unloose
,
so
that
he
begin
to
speak
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
May
I
not

<EOS>
and
why
not
?
<EOS>
They

happy
when

<EOS>
much
the
good

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
only

<EOS>
I
wish
I

of
your
heart

Cora

so
that
I
could
see
what
it
be

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
the
old
day
he
have
always
call
her
Cora
,
and
now
the
name
come
from
his
lip
upon
her
ear
as
a
thing
of
custom
,
cause
no
surprise
.
<EOS>
They
be
stand
back
,
behind
the
circle
,
almost
in
a
corner
,
and
Burgo
know
well
how
to
speak
at
such
moment
so
that
his
word
should
be
audible
to
none
but
her
whom
he
address
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
not
have
come

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
come
and
dance
<EOS>
,
"
she
say
;
"
I
see
a
pair
of
eye
look
at

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
pair
of
eye
which
Lady
Glencora
see
be
in
the
possession
of
Mr.
Bott
,
who
be
stand
alone
,
lean
against
the
side
of
the
doorway
,
every
now
and
then
raise
his
heel
from
the
ground
,
so
that
he
may
look
down
upon
the
sinner
as
from
a
vantage
ground
.
<EOS>
He
be
quite
alone
.
<EOS>
Mrs.

have
leave
him
,
and
have
get
herself
away
in
Lady
Glencora
's
own
carriage
to
Park
Lane
,
in
order
that
she
may
find
Mr.

there
,
if
by
chance

<EOS>
"
will

<EOS>
Mrs.

have
say
when
Mr.

this
line
of
conduct

<EOS>
"
there

Mr.

"
He

<EOS>
and
so
he
do
keep
his
eye
upon

.
  
<EOS>
again
they
go
round
the
room
,
 
or
that
small
portion
of
the

which
the

have
leave
to
the

as
though
they

Lady

She

"

in

<EOS>
She
do
not

<EOS>
perhaps
her
breath
do
not
return
to

as
rapidly
as
his

<EOS>
but
,
of
course
,
he
know
that

<EOS>
She
would
have
quickly

with
indifference

Lady

when

recover

She
would

ashamed

<EOS>
for
the
matter
of

if
he
press
her
on

,
she
could
bring
herself
to
tell
him
that
she
love
Burgo
Fitzgerald
much
more
easily
than
she
could
whisper
such
a
word
to
Burgo
himself

<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
's
eye
be
odious
to
her
as
they
watch
her

her
husband

glance
she
could

away

order
his
carriage
as
he
pass
through
the
hall

leave
Mr.
Bott
still
watch

door

<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
resolve
that
she
would
say
nothing
to
Burgo
while
her

<EOS>
there
be
a
touch
of
chivalry
in
his
leave
them
again
together
,
which
so
far
conquer
her
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
bade
her
<EOS>
leave
the
scarf

and
come
at
once
.
<EOS>
She
have
see
,
moreover
,
that
he
have
not

to
Mr.

and
be
thankful
to

also

<EOS>
Burgo
also
seem

do

I
hope

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
absolutely
decline
to
say
anything
on
the
subject
on

occasion

George
Vavasor

in
a
very
happy
mood
when
he
leave
Queen
Anne
Street
,
after
have
fling
his
gift
ring
under
the
grate
.
<EOS>
indeed
there
be
much
in
his
condition
,
as
connect
with
the
house
which
he
be
leave
,
which
could
not
but
make
him
unhappy
.
<EOS>
Alice
be
engage
to
be
his
wife
,
and
have
as
yet
say
nothing
to
show
that
she
meditate
any
breach
of
that
engagement
,
but
she
have
treat
him
in
a
way
which
make
him
long
to
throw
her
promise
in
her
tooth
.
<EOS>
He
be
a

whom
any
personal

from

be
unendurable

<EOS>
to
slight
from
man
,
unless
they
be
of
a
nature
to
provoke
offence

he
be
indifferent
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
man
live
for
whose
liking
or
disliking
George
Vavasor
care
anything
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
care
much
for
the
good
opinion
,
or
rather
for
the
personal
favour
,
of
any
woman
to
whom
he
have
endeavour
to
make
himself
agreeable
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
marry
you
,
"
Alice
have
say
to
him
,
 
not
in
word
,
but
in
act
and
look
,
which
be
plain
than
word
,
 
"
I
will
marry
you
for
certain
reason
of
my

which
in
my
present
condition
make
it
seem
that
that
arrangement
will
be
more
convenient
to
me
than
any
other
that
I
can
make
;
but
pray
understand
that
there
be
no

up
with
this

<EOS>
there
be
another
man
whom
I
love

only
,
for
those
reason
above
hint
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
care
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
thus
that
he
read
Alice
's
present
treatment
of
him
,
and
he
be
a
man
who
could
not
endure
this
treatment
with
ease
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
he
could
throw
his
ring
under
the
grate
in
his
passion
,
he
could
not
so
dispose
of
her
.
<EOS>
that
he
would
have
do
<EOS>
so
have
his
hand
be
free
<EOS>
,
we
need
not
doubt
.
<EOS>
and
he
would
have
be
clever
enough
to
do
so
in
some
manner
that
would
have
be
exquisitely
painful
to
Alice
,
willing
as
she
may
be
to
be
release
from
her
engagement
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
do
this
to
a
woman
whose
money
he
have
borrow
,
and
whose
money
he
could
not
repay
;
 
to
a
woman
,
more
of
whose
money
he
intend
to
borrow
immediately
.
<EOS>
as
to
that
latter
part
of
it
,
he
do
say
to
himself
over
and
over
again
,
that
he
would
have
no
more
of
it
.
<EOS>
as
he
leave
the
house
in
Queen
Anne
Street
,
on
that
occasion
,
he
swear
,
that
under
no
circumstance
would
he
be
indebted
to
her
for
another
shilling
.
<EOS>
but
before
he
have
reach
Great
Marlborough
Street
,
to
which
his
step
take
him
,
he
have
remind
himself
that
everything
depend
on
a
further
advance
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
Parliament
,
but
Parliament
would
be
dissolve
within
three
month
.
<EOS>
have
sacrifice
so
much
for
his
position
,
should
he
let
it
all
fall
from
him
now
,
 
now
,
when
success
seem
to
be
within
his
reach
?
<EOS>
that
wretche
old
man
in
Westmoreland
,
who
seem
gifted
almost
with
immortality
,
 
<EOS>
why
could
he
not
die
and
surrender
his
paltry
acre
to
one
who
could
use
them
?
<EOS>
He
turn
away
from
Regent
Street
into
Hanover
Square
before
he
cross
to
Great
Marlborough
Street
,
give
vent
to
his
passion
rather
than
arrange
his
thought
.
<EOS>
as
he
walk
the
four
side
of
the
square
he
consider
how
good
it
would
be
if
some
accident
should
befall
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
how
he
would
rejoice
be
he
to
hear
to
-
morrow
that
one
of
the
tree
of
the
"
accursed
place
,
"
have
fall
on
the
"
obstinate
old
idiot
,
"
and
put
an
end
to
him
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
he
meditate
the
murder
of
his
grandfather
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
firm
conviction
on
his
mind
,
as
he
think
of
all
this
,
that
such
a
deed
as
that
would
never
come
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
but
he
tell
himself
,
that
if
he
choose
to
make
the
attempt
,
he
would
certainly
be
able
to
carry
it
through
without
detection
.
<EOS>
then
he
remember
Rush
and
Palmer
 
the
openly
bold
murderer
and
the
secret
poisoner
.
<EOS>
both
of
them
,
in
Vavasor
's
estimation
,
be
great
man
.
<EOS>
He
have
often
say
so
in
company
.
<EOS>
He
have
declare
that
the
courage
of
Rush
have
never
be
surpass
.
"
<EOS>
think
of
him
,
"
he
would
say
with
admiration
,
"
walk
into
a
man
's
house
,
with
pistol
sufficient
to
shoot
every
one
there
,
and
do
it
as
though
he
be
kill
rat
!
<EOS>
what
be
Nelson
at
Trafalgar
to
that
?
<EOS>
Nelson
have
nothing
to
fear
!
"
<EOS>
and
of
Palmer
he
declare
that
he
be
a
man
of
genius
as
well
as
courage
.
<EOS>
He
have
"
look
the
whole
thing
in
the
face
,
"
Vavasor
would
say
,
"
and
tell
himself
that
all
scruple
and
squeamishness
be
bosh
,
 
child
's
tale
.
<EOS>
and
so
they
be
.
<EOS>
who
live
as
though
they
fear
either
heaven
or
hell
?
<EOS>
and
if
we
do
live
without
such
fear
or
respect
,
what
be
the
use
of
tell
lie
to
ourselves
?
<EOS>
to
throw
it
all
to
the
dog
,
as

<EOS>
Vavasor
walk
round
Hanover
Square
,
nurse
his
hatred
against
the
old
Squire
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
tell
himself
that
he
would
like
to
murder
his
grandfather
.
<EOS>
but
he
suggest
to
himself
,
that
if
he
desire
to
do
so
,
he
would
have
courage
enough
to
make
his
way
into
the
old
man
's
room
,
and
strangle
him
;
and
he
explain
to
himself
how
he
would
be
able
to
get
down
into
Westmoreland
without
the
world
know
that
he
have
be
there
,
 
how
he
would
find
an
entrance
into
the
house
by
a
window
with
which
he
be
acquaint
,
 
how
he
could
cause
the
man
to
die
as
though
,
those
around
him
should
think
,
it
be
apoplexy
,
 
<EOS>
he
,
George
Vavasor
,
have
read
something
on
that
subject
lately
.
<EOS>
all
this
he
consider
very
fully
,
walk
rapidly
round
Hanover
Square
more
than
once
or
twice
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
to
become
an
active
student
in
the
Rush
or
Palmer
school
,
he
would
so
study
the
matter
that
he
would
not
be
the
one
that
should
be
hang
.
<EOS>
He
think
that
he
could
,
so
far
,
trust
his
own
ingenuity
.
<EOS>
but
yet
he
do
not
meditate
murder
.
"
<EOS>
beastly
old
idiot
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
say
to
himself
,
"
he
must
have
his
chance
as
other
man
have
,
I
suppose
,
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
go
across
Regent
Street
to
Mr.

office
in
Great
Marlborough
Street

not
have
,
as
yet

come
to
any
positive
conclusion
as
to
what
he
would
do
in
reference
to
Alice

money

<EOS>
but
he
soon
find
himself
talk
to
Mr.

as
though
there
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
forthcoming

for
the

<EOS>
and
Mr.
Scruby
talk
to
him
very
plainly
,
as
though
those

must
be
forthcoming
before
long
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
stitch
in

save
nine

"
say
Mr.

,
mean
to
insinuate
that
a

in

may
have
the

effect

I
will
tell
you

it

They
be
talk

<EOS>
why
,
then
,
I
will
lump
the
two
bill
together
when
it
be
all
over

"
  
<EOS>
in
their
discussion
respect
money
Mr.
Scruby
injudiciously
mention
the
name
of
Mr.
Tombe
.
<EOS>
no
precise
caution
have
be
give
to
him
,
but
he
have
become
aware
that
the
matter
be
be
manage
through
an
agency
that
be
not
recognize
by
his
client
;
and
as
that
agency
be
simply
a
vehicle
of
money
which
find
its
way
into
Mr.
Scruby
's
pocket
,
he
should
have
hold
his
tongue
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Tombe
's
name
escape
from
him
,
and
Vavasor
immediately
question
him
.
<EOS>
scruby
,
who
do
not
often
make
such
blunder
,
readily
excuse
himself
,
shake
his
head
,
and
declare
that
the
name
have
fall
from
his
lip
instead
of
that
of
another
man
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
accept
the
excuse
without
further
notice
,
and
nothing
more
be
say
about
Mr.
Tombe
while
he
be
in
Mr.
Scruby
's
office
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
not
hear
the
name
in
vain
,
and
have
unfortunately
hear
it
before
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tombe
be
a
remarkable
man
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
He
wear
powder
to
his
hair
,
 
be
very
polite
in
his
bearing
,
 
be
somewhat
asthmatic
,
and
wheeze
in
his
talking
,
 
and
be
,
moreover
,
the
most
obedient
of
man
,
though
it
be
say
of
him
that
he
manage
the
whole
income
of
the
Ely
Chapter
just
as
he
please
.
<EOS>
be
in
these
way
a
man
of
note
,
John
Grey
have
speak
of
him
to
Alice
,
and
his
name
have
filter
through
Alice
and
her
cousin
Kate
to
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
George
seldom
forget
thing
or
name
,
and
when
he
hear
Mr.
Tombe
's
name
mention
in
connection
with
his
own
money
matter
,
he
remember
that
Mr.
Tombe
be
John
Grey
's
lawyer
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
could
escape
out
into
the
street
he
endeavour
to
put
all
these
thing
together
,
and
after
a
while
resolve
that
he
would
go
to
Mr.
Tombe
.
<EOS>
what
if
there
should
be
an
understanding
between
John
Grey
and
Alice
,
and
Mr.
Tombe
should
be
arrange
his
money
matter
for
him
!
<EOS>
Would
not
anything
be
well
than
this
,
 
even
that
little
tragedy
down
in
Westmoreland
,
for
which
his
ingenuity
and
courage
would
be
require
?
<EOS>
He
could
endure
to
borrow
money
from
Alice
.
<EOS>
He
may
even
endure
it
still
,
 
though
that
be
very
difficult
after
her
treatment
of
him
;
but
he
could
not
endure
to
be
the
recipient
of
John
Grey
's
money
.
<EOS>
by
heaven
,
no
!
<EOS>
and
as
he
get
into
a
cab
,
and
have
himself
drive
off
to
the
neighbourhood
of
doctor
"
Commons
,
he
give
himself
credit
for
much
fine
manly
feeling
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Tombe
's
chamber
be
find
without
difficulty
,
and
,
as
it
happen
,
Mr.
Tombe
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
the
lawyer
rise
from
his
chair
as
Vavasor
enter
,
and
bow
his
powdered
head
very
meekly
as
he
ask
his
visitor
to
sit
down
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
;
 
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
.
<EOS>
He
have
hear
the
name
.
<EOS>
yes
;
he
be
in
the
habit
of
act
for
his
very
old
friend
Mr.
John
Grey
.
<EOS>
He
have
act
for
Mr.
John
Grey
,
and
for
Mr.
John
Grey
's
father
,
 
he
or
his
partner
,
 
he
believe
he
may
say
,
for
about
half
a
century
.
<EOS>
there
could
not
be
a
nice
gentleman
than
Mr.
John
Grey
;
 
and
such
a
pretty
child
as
he
use
to
be
!
"
<EOS>
at
every
new
sentence
Mr.
Tombe
catch
his
poor
asthmatic
breath
,
and
bow
his
meek
old
head
,
and
rub
his
hand
together
as
though
he
hardly
dare
to
keep
his
seat
in
Vavasor
's
presence
without
the
support
of
some
such
motion
;
and
wheeze
apologetically
,
and
seem
to
ask
pardon
of
his
visitor
for
not
know
intuitively
what
be
the
nature
of
that
visitor
's
business
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
a
sly
old
fox
be
Mr.
Tombe
,
and
be
consider
all
this
time
how
much
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
tell
Mr.
Vavasor
,
and
how
much
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
conceal
.
<EOS>
"
the
fat
have
get
into
the
fire
,
"
as
he
tell
his
old
wife
when
he
get
home
that
evening
.
<EOS>
He
tell
his
old
wife
everything
,
and
I
do
not
know
that
any
of
his
client
be
the
bad
for
his
do
so
.
<EOS>
but
while
he
be
wheeze
,
and
coughing
,
and
apologize
,
he
make
up
his
mind
that
if
George
Vavasor
be
to
ask
him
certain
question
,
it
would
be
good
that
he
should
answer
them
truly
.
<EOS>
if
Vavasor
do
ask
those
question
,
he
would
probably
do
so
upon
certain
knowledge
,
and
if
so
,
why
,
in
that
case
,
lying
would
be
of
no
use
.
<EOS>
lie
would
not
put
the
fat
back
into
the
fry
pan
.
<EOS>
and
even
though
such
question
may
be
ask
without
any
absolute
knowledge
,
they
would
,
at
any
rate
,
show
that
the
questioner
have
the
mean
of
ascertain
the
truth
.
<EOS>
He
would
tell
as
little
as
he
could
;
but
he
decide
during
his
last
wheeze
,
that
he
could
not
lie
in
the
matter
with
any
chance
of
benefit
his
client
.
"
<EOS>
the
prettiest
child
I
ever
see
,
Mr.
Vavasor
!
"
say
Mr.
Tombe
,
and
then
he
cough
violently
.
<EOS>
some
people
who
know
Mr.
Tombe
declare
that
he
nurse
his
cough
.

Can

Mr.

we

that

for
up

he

take

<EOS>
what
occur
in
Suffolk
Street
,
Pall
Mall
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Tombe
have
gain
nothing
for
the
cause
by
his
crafty
silence
.
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
feel
perfectly
certain
,
as
he
walk
out
from
the
little
street
which
run
at
the
back
of
doctor
"
Commons
,
that
the
money
which
he
have
be
use
have
come
,
in
some
shape
,
through
the
hand
of
John
Grey
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
care
much
to
calculate
whether
the
payment
have
be
make
from
the
personal
fund
of
his
rival
,
or
whether
that
rival
have
be
employ
to
dispense
Alice
's
fortune
.
<EOS>
under
either
view
of
the
case
his
position
be
sufficiently
bitter
.
<EOS>
the
truth
never
for
a
moment
occur
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
never
dream
that
there
may
be
a
conspiracy
in
the
matter
,
of
which
Alice
be
as
ignorant
as
he
himself
have
be
.
<EOS>
He
never
reflect
that
his
uncle
John
,
together
with
John
,
the
lover
,
whom
he
so
hated
,
may
be
the
conspirator
.
<EOS>
to
him
it
seem
to
be
certain
that
Alice
and
Mr.
Grey
be
in
league
;
 
and
if
they
be
in
league
,
what
must
he
think
of
Alice
,
and
of
her
engagement
with
himself
!
  
<EOS>
there
be
man
who
rarely
think
well
of
woman
,
 
who
hardly
think
well
of
any
woman
.
<EOS>
They
put
their
mother
and
sister
into
the
background
,
 
as
though
they
belong
to
some
sex
or
race
apart
,
 
and
then
declare
to
themselves
and
to
their
friend
that
all
woman
be
false
,
 
that
no
woman
can
be
trust
unless
her
ugliness
protect
her
;
and
that
every
woman
may
be
attack
as
fairly
as
may
game
in
a
cover
,
or
deer
on
a
mountain
,
what
man
do
not
know
man
who
have
so
think
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
such
have
be
Vavasor
's
creed
,
 
not
entirely
such
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
period
of
his
life
when
he
have
believe
implicitly
in
his
cousin
Alice
;
 
but
then
there
have
be
other
moment
in
which
he
have
ridicule
himself
for
his
Quixotism
in
believe
in
any
woman
.
<EOS>
and
as
he
have
grow
old
the
moment
of
his
Quixotism
have
become
more
rare
.
<EOS>
there
would
have
be
no
such
Quixotism
leave
with
him
now
,
have
not
the
various
circumstance
which
I
have
attempt
to
describe
,
fill
him
,
during
the
last
twelve
month
,
with
a
renew
desire
to
marry
his
cousin
.
<EOS>
every
man
try
to
believe
in
the
honesty
of
his
future
wife
;
and
,
therefore
,
Vavasor
have
try
,
and
have
in
his
way
,
believe
.
<EOS>
He
have
flatter
himself
,
too
,
that
Alice
's
heart
have
,
in
truth
,
be
more
prone
to
him
than
to
that
other
suitor
.
<EOS>
Grey
,
as
he
think
,
have
be
accept
by
her
cold
prudence
;
but
he
think
,
also
,
that
she
have
find
her
prudence
to
be
too
cold
,
and
have
therefore
return
where
she
have
truly
love
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
though
he
do
not
love
much
himself
,
be
willing
enough
to
be
the
object
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
this
idea
of
his
,
however
,
have
be
greatly
shake
by
Alice
's
treatment
of
himself
personally
;
but
still
he
have
not
,
hitherto
,
believe
that
she
be
false
to
him
.
<EOS>
now
,
what
could
he
believe
of
her
?
<EOS>
what
be
there
within
the
compass
of
such
a
one
to
believe
?
<EOS>
as
he
walk
out
into
St.
Paul
's
Churchyard
he
call
her
by
every
name
which
be
most
offensive
to
a
woman
's
ear
.
<EOS>
He
hate
her
at
this
moment
with
even
a
more
bitter
hatred
than
that
which
he
feel
towards
John
Grey
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
deceive
him
with
unparalleled
hypocrisy
,
and
lie
to
him
and
to
his
sister
Kate
as
hardly
any
woman
have
ever
lie
before
.
<EOS>
or
could
it
be
that
Kate
,
also
,
be
lie
to
him
?
<EOS>
if
so
,
Kate
also
should
be
include
in
the
punishment
.
  
<EOS>
but
why
should
they
have
conspire
to
feed
him
with
these
money
?
<EOS>
there
have
be
no
deceit
,
at
any
rate
,
in
reference
to
the
pound
sterling
which
Scruby
have
already
swallow
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
supply
,
whatever
have
be
the
motive
of
the
supplier
;
and
he
have
no
doubt
that
more
would
be
supply
if
he
would
only
keep
himself
quiet
.
<EOS>
He
be
still
walk
westward
as
he
think
of
this
,
down
Ludgate
Hill
,
on
his
direct
line
towards
Suffolk
Street
;
and
he
try
to
persuade
himself
that
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
hide
his
wrath
till
after
provision
should
have
be
make
for
this
other
election
.
<EOS>
They
be
his
enemy
,
 
Alice
and
Mr.
Grey
,
 
and
why
should
he
keep
any
term
with
his
enemy
?
<EOS>
It
be
still
a
trouble
to
him
to
think
that
he
should
have
be
in
any
way
beholden
to
John
Grey
;
but
the
terrible
thing
have
be
do
,
the
evil
have
occur
.
<EOS>
what
would
he
gain
by
stay
his
hand
now
?
<EOS>
still
,
however
,
he
walk
on
quickly
along
Fleet
Street
,
and
along
the
Strand
,
and
be
already
cross
under
the
Picture
Galleries
towards
Pall
Mall
East
before
he
have
definitely
decide
what
step
he
would
take
on
this
very
day
.
<EOS>
exactly
at
the
corner
of
Suffolk
Street
he
meet
John
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Grey
,
"
he
say
,
stop
himself
suddenly
,
"
I
be
this
moment
go
to
call
on
you
at
your
lodging
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
at
my
lodging
,
be
you
?
<EOS>
Shall
I
return
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
please
,
"
say
Vavasor
,
lead
the
way
up
Suffolk
Street
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
no
other
greeting
than
this
between
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
himself
,
though
a
man
very
courteous
in
his
general
demeanour
,
would
probably
have
pass
Vavasor
in
the
street
with
no
more
than
the
bare
salutation
.
<EOS>
situate
as
they
be
towards
each
other
there
could
hardly
be
any
show
of
friendship
between
them
;
but
when
Vavasor
have
speak
to
him
,
he
have
dress
his
face
in
that
guise
of
civility
which
man
always
use
who
do
not
intend
to
be
offensive
;
 
but
Vavasor
dress
his
as
man
dress
theirs
who
do
mean
to
be
offensive
;
and
Mr.
Grey
have
thoroughly
appreciate
the
dressing
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
allow
me
,
I
have
the
key
,
"
say
Grey
.
<EOS>
then
they
both
enter
the
house
,
and
Vavasor
follow
his
host
up
-
stair
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
,
as
he
go
up
,
feel
almost
angry
with
himself
in
have
admit
his
enemy
into
his
lodging
.
<EOS>
He
be
sure
that
no
good
could
come
of
it
,
and
remember
,
when
it
be
too
late
,
that
he
may
easily
have
save
himself
from
give
the
invitation
while
he
be
still
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
there
they
be
,
however
,
together
in
the
sitting
-
room
,
and
Grey
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
listen
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
take
a
chair
,
Mr.
Vavasor
?
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Vavasor
;
"
I
will
stand
up
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
stand
up
,
hold
his
hat
behind
his
back
with
his
left
hand
,
with
his
right
leg
forward
,
and
the
thumb
of
his
right
hand
in
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
.
<EOS>
He
look
full
into
Grey
's
face
,
and
Grey
look
full
into
his
;
and
as
he
look
the
great
cicatrice
seem
to
open
itself
and
to
become
purple
with
fresh
blood
stain
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
here
from
Mr.
Tombe
's
office
in
the
City
,
"
say
Vavasor
,
"
to
ask
you
of
what
nature
have
be
the
interference
which
you
have
take
in
my
money
matter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
question
which
Mr.
Grey
could
not
answer
very
quickly
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
it
be
altogether
unexpected
;
in
the
next
place
he
do
not
know
what
Mr.
Tombe
have
tell
,
and
what
he
have
not
tell
;
and
then
,
before
he
reply
,
he
must
think
how
much
of
the
truth
he
be
bind
to
tell
in
answer
to
a
question
so
put
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
say
that
you
have
come
from
Mr.
Tombe
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
hear
me
say
so
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
here
direct
from
Mr.
Tombe
's
chamber
.
<EOS>
He
be
your
lawyer
,
I
believe
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
I
have
come
from
him
to
ask
you
what
interference
you
have
lately
take
in
my
money
matter
.
<EOS>
when
you
have
answer
that
,
I
shall
have
other
question
to
ask
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
have
it
occur
to
you
that
I
may
not
be
dispose
to
answer
question
so
ask
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
have
not
occur
to
me
to
think
that
you
will
prevaricate
.
<EOS>
if
there
have
be
no
such
interference
,
I
will
ask
your
pardon
,
and
go
away
;
but
if
there
have
be
such
interference
on
your
part
,
I
have
a
right
to
demand
that
you
shall
explain
to
me
its
nature
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grey
have
now
make
up
his
mind
that
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
tell
the
whole
story
,
 
better
not
only
for
himself
,
but
for
all
the
vavasor
,
include
this
angry
man
himself
.
<EOS>
the
angry
man
evidently
know
something
,
and
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
know
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
there
have
be
such
interference
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
if
you
choose
to
call
it
so
.
<EOS>
money
,
to
the
extent
of
two
thousand
pound
,
I
think
,
have
by
my
direction
be
pay
to
your
credit
by
Mr.
Tombe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Vavasor
,
take
his
right
hand
away
from
his
waistcoat
,
and
tap
the
round
table
with
his
finger
impatiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
how
to
explain
all
the
circumstance
under
which
this
have
be
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
not
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
you
must
explain
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grey
be
a
man
tranquil
in
temperament
,
very
little
prone
to
quarrel
,
with
perhaps
an
exaggerated
idea
of
the
evil
result
of
a
row
,
 
a
man
who
would
take
infinite
trouble
to
avoid
any
such
scene
as
that
which
now
seem
to
be
imminent
;
but
he
be
a
man
whose
courage
be
quite
as
high
as
that
of
his
opponent
.
<EOS>
to
bully
or
be
bully
be
alike
contrary
to
his
nature
.
<EOS>
It
be
clear
enough
now
that
Vavasor
intend
to
bully
him
,
and
he
make
up
his
mind
at
once
that
if
the
quarrel
be
force
upon
him
it
should
find
him
ready
to
take
his
own
part
.
<EOS>
"
My
difficulty
in
explain
it
come
from
consideration
for
you
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
beg
that
your
difficulty
will
cease
,
and
that
you
will
have
no
consideration
for
me
.
<EOS>
We
be
so
circumstanced
towards
each
other
that
any
consideration
must
be
humbug
and
nonsense
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
I
intend
to
have
none
for
you
.
<EOS>
now
,
let
me
know
why
you
have
meddle
with
my
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
may
,
perhaps
,
better
refer
you
to
your
uncle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
;
Mr.
Tombe
be
not
my
uncle
's
lawyer
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
never
hear
his
name
,
unless
he
hear
of
it
from
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
by
agreement
with
your
uncle
that
I
commission
Mr.
Tombe
to
raise
for
you
the
money
you
be
desirous
of
borrow
from
your
cousin
.
<EOS>
We
think
it
better
that
her
fortune
should
not
be
for
the
moment
disturb
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
have
you
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
why
should
you
have
do
it
?
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
I
do
not
believe
your
story
;
it
be
altogether
improbable
.
<EOS>
but
why
should
he
come
to
you
of
all
man
to
raise
money
on
his
daughter
's
behalf
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
unless
you
can
behave
yourself
with
more
discretion
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
you
must
leave
the
room
,
"
say
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
then
,
as
Vavasor
simply
sneer
at
him
,
but
speak
nothing
,
he
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
I
who
suggest
to
your
uncle
that
this
arrangement
should

sir

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
altogether
decline

with
you
Miss
Vavasor

present

future
position
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
by
heaven

then

you
shall
hear
me

it

<EOS>
She
be
engage
to
you

have
give
you
your
dismissal

you

anything

I
now

,
you
have
contrive
this
rascally
pettifog
way
of
obtain
power
over
her
income
.
<EOS>
the
money
shall
be
repay
at
once
,
with
any
interest
that
can
be
due
;
and
if
I
find
you
interfere
again
,
I
will
expose
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Vavasor
,
"
say
Grey
very
slowly
,
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
,
but
with
something
in
his
eye
which
would
have
tell
any
bystander
that
he
be
much
in
earnest
,
"
you
have
use
word
in
your
anger
which
I
can
not
allow
to
pass
.
<EOS>
You
must
recall
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
word
?
<EOS>
I
say
that
you
be
a
pettifogging
rascal
.
<EOS>
I
now
repeat
them
.
<EOS>
"
as
he
speak
he
put
on
his
hat
,
so
as
to
leave
both
his
hand
ready
for
action
if
action
should
be
require
.
  
<EOS>
Grey
be
much
the
large
man
and
much
the
strong
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
doubt
whether
he
know
himself
the
extent
of
his
own
strength
,
but
such
as
it
be
he
resolve
that
he
must
now
use
it
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
help
for
it
,
"
he
say
,
as
he
also
prepare
for
action
.
<EOS>
the
first
thing
he
do
be
to
open
the
door
,
and
as
he
do
so
he
become
conscious
that
his
mouth
be
full
of
blood
from
a
sharp
blow
upon
his
face
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
have
strike
him
with
his
fist
,
and
have
cut
his
lip
against
his
tooth
.
<EOS>
then
there
come
a
scramble
,
and
Grey
be
soon
aware
that
he
have
his
opponent
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
he
have
attempt
to
strike
a
blow
,
or
whether
he
have
so
much
as
clench
his
fist
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
have
strike
him
repeatedly
,
but
the
blow
have
fall
on
his
body
or
his
head
,
and
he
be
unconscious
of
them
.
<EOS>
He
have
but
one
object
now
in
his
mind
,
and
that
object
be
the
kick
his
assailant
down
the
stair
.
<EOS>
then
come
a
scramble
,
as
I
have
say
,
and
Grey
have
a
hold
of
the
small
man
by
the
nape
of
his
neck
.
<EOS>
so
hold
him
he
force
him
back
through
the
door
on
to
the
landing
,
and
there
succeed
in
push
him
down
the
first
flight
of
step
.
<EOS>
Grey
kick
at
him
as
he
go
,
but
the
kick
be
impotent
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
however
,
be
so
far
successful
that
he
have
thrust
his
enemy
out
of
the
room
,
and
have
the
satisfaction
of
see
him
sprawl
on
the
landing
-
place
.
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
when
he
raise
himself
,
prepared
to
make
another
rush
at
the
room
,
but
before
he
could
do
so
a
man
from
below
,
hear
the
noise
,
have
come
upon
him
and
interrupt
him
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Jones
,
"
say
Grey
,
speak
from
above
,
"
if
that
gentleman
do
not
leave
the
house
,
I
must
get
you
to
search
for
a
policeman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
though
the
lodging
-
house
man
have
hold
of
the
collar
of
his
coat
,
make
no
attempt
to
turn
upon
his
new
enemy
.
<EOS>
when
two
dog
be
fight
,
any
bystander
may
attempt
to
separate
them
with
impunity
.
<EOS>
the
brute
be
so
anxious
to
tear
each
other
that
they
have
no
energy
leave
for
other
purpose
.
<EOS>
It
never
occur
to
them
to
turn
their
tooth
upon
newcomer
in
the
quarrel
.
<EOS>
so
it
be
with
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
Jones
be
sufficient
to
prevent
his
further
attack
upon
the
foe
up
-
stair
,
and
therefore
he
have
no
alternative
but
to
relinquish
the
fight
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
all
about
,
sir
?
"
say
Jones
,
who
keep
a
tailor
's
establishment
,
and
,
as
a
tailor
,
be
something
of
a
fighting
man
himself
.
<EOS>
of
all
tradesman
in
London
<EOS>
the
tailor
be
,
no
doubt
,
the
most
combative
,
 
as
may
be
expect
from
the
necessity
which
lie
upon
them
of
live
down
the
general
bad
character
in
this
respect
which
the
world
have
wrongly
give
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
be
it
all
about
,
sir
?
"
say
Jones
,
still
hold
Vavasor
by
his
coat
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
man
have
ill
-
use
me
,
and
I
have
punish
him
;
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
much
about
punish
,
"
say
the
tailor
.
<EOS>
"
It
seem
to
me
he
pitch
you
down
pretty
clean
out
of
the
room
above
.
<EOS>
I
think
the
good
thing
you
can
do
now
be
to
walk
yourself
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
only
thing
that
Vavasor
could
do
,
and
he
do
walk
himself
off
.
<EOS>
He
walk
himself
off
,
and
go
home
to
his
own
lodging
in
Cecil
Street
,
that
he
may
smooth
his
feather
after
the
late
encounter
before
he
go
down
to
Westminster
to
take
his
seat
in
the
House
of
Commons
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
he
be
comfortable
when
he
get
there
,
or
that
he
feel
himself
very
well
able
to
fight
another
battle
that
night
on
behalf
of
the
River
Bank
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
hurt
,
but
he
have
be
worst
.
<EOS>
Grey
have
probably
receive
more
personal
damage
than
have
fall
to
his
share
;
but
Grey
have
succeed
in
expel
him
from
the
room
,
and
he
know
that
he
have
be
find
prostrate
on
the
landing
-
place
when
the
tailor
first
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
may
probably
have
get
over
the
annoyance
of
this
feeling
<EOS>
have
he
not
be
overwhelm
by
a
consciousness
that
everything
be
go
badly
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
already
begin
to
hate
his
seat
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
what
good
have
it
do
for
him
,
or
be
it
likely
to
do
for
him
?
<EOS>
He
find
himself
to
be
associate
there
with
Mr.
Bott
,
and
a
few
other
of
the
same
class
,
 
man
whom
he
despise
;
and
even
they
do
not
admit
him
among
them
without
a
certain
show
of
superiority
on
their
part
.
<EOS>
who
have
not
ascertain
by
his
own
experience
the
different
light
through
which
the
same
event
may
be
see
,
accord
to
the
success
,
or
want
of
success
,
which
pervade
the
atmosphere
at
the
moment
?
<EOS>
at
the
present
time
everything
be
unsuccessful
with
George
Vavasor
;
and
though
he
tell
himself
,
almost
from
hour
to
hour
,
that
he
would
go
on
with
the
thing
which
he
have
begin
,
 
that
he
would
persevere
in
Parliament
till
he
have
obtain
a
hearing
there
and
create
for
himself
success
,
he
could
not
himself
believe
in
the
promise
which
he
have
make
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
have
look
forward
to
his
entrance
into
that
Chamber
as
the
hour
of
his
triumph
;
but
he
have
enter
it
with
Mr.
Bott
,
and
there
have
be
no
triumph
to
him
in
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
have
swear
to
himself
that
when
there
he
would
find
man
to
hear
him
.
<EOS>
hitherto
,
indeed
,
he
could
not
accuse
himself
of
have
miss
his
opportunity
;
his
election
have
be
so
recent
that
he
could
hardly
yet
have
make
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
be
there
long
enough
to
learn
to
fancy
that
there
be
no
glory
in
attempt
.
<EOS>
this
art
of
speak
in
Parliament
,
which
have
appear
to
him
to
be
so
grand
,
seem
already
to
be
a
humdrum
,
homely
,
dull
affair
.
<EOS>
no
one
seem
to
listen
much
to
what
be
say
.
<EOS>
to
such
as
himself
,
 
member
without
an
acquire
name
,
 
man
do
not
seem
to
listen
at
all
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
have
once
,
in
his
hearing
,
speak
for
two
hour
together
,
and
all
the
House
have
treat
his
speech
with
respect
,
 
have
declare
that
it
be
useful
,
solid
,
conscientious
,
and
what
not
;
but
more
than
half
the
House
have
be
asleep
more
than
half
the
time
that
he
be
on
his
leg
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
have
not
as
yet
commence
his
career
as
an
orator
;
but
night
after
night
,
as
he
sit
there
,
the
chance
of
commence
it
with
brilliance
seem
to
be
further
from
him
,
and
still
further
.
<EOS>
two
thousand
pound
of
his
own
money
,
and
two
thousand
more
of
Alice
's
money
,
 
or
of
Mr.
Grey
's
,
 
<EOS>
he
have
already
spend
to
make
his
way
into
that
assembly
.
<EOS>
He
must
spend
,
at
any
rate
,
two
thousand
more
if
he
intend
that
his
career
should
be
prolong
beyond
a
three
month
'
sit
;
 
and
how
be
he
to
get
this
further
sum
after
what
have
take
place
to
-
day
?
  
<EOS>
He
would
get
it
.
<EOS>
that
be
his
resolve
as
he
walk
in
by
the
apple
-
woman
's
stall
,
under
the
shadow
of
the
great
policeman
,
and
between
the
two
august
lamp
.
<EOS>
He
would
get
it
;
 
as
long
as
Alice
have
a
pound
over
which
he
could
obtain
mastery
by
any
act
or
violence
within
his
compass
.
<EOS>
He
would
get
it
;
even
though
it
should
come
through
the
hand
of
John
Grey
and
Mr.
Tombe
.
<EOS>
He
would
get
it
;
though
in
do
so
he
may
destroy
his
cousin
Alice
and
ruin
his
sister
Kate
.
<EOS>
He
have
go
too
far
to
stick
at
any
scruple
.
<EOS>
have
he
not
often
declare
how
great
have
be
that
murderer
who
have
be
able
to
divest
himself
of
all
such
scruple
,
 
who
have
scour
his
bosom
free
from
all
fear
of
the
hereafter
,
and
,
as
regard
the
present
,
have
dare
to
trust
for
everything
to
success
?
<EOS>
He
would
go
to
Alice
and
demand
the
money
from
her
with
threat
,
and
with
that
violence
in
his
eye
which
he
know
so
well
how
to
assume
.
<EOS>
He
believe
that
when
he
so
demand
it
,
the
money
would
be
forthcoming
so
as
to
satisfy
,
at
any
rate
,
his
present
emergency
.
  
<EOS>
that
wretched
old
man
in
Westmoreland
!
<EOS>
if
he
would
but
die
,
there
may
yet
be
a
hope
remain
of
permanent
success
!
<EOS>
even
though
the
estate
may
be
entail
so
as
to
give
him
no
more
than
a
life
-
interest
,
still
money
may
be
raise
on
it
.
<EOS>
His
life
-
interest
in
it
would
be
worth
ten
or
twelve
year
<EOS>
"
purchase
.
<EOS>
He
have
an
idea
that
his
grandfather
have
not
as
yet
make
any
such
will
when
he
leave
the
place
in
Westmoreland
.
<EOS>
what
a
boon
it
would
be
if
death
could
be
make
to
overtake
the
old
man
before
he
do
so
!
<EOS>
on
this
very
night
he
walk
about
the
lobby
of
the
House
,
think
of
all
this
.
<EOS>
He
go
by
himself
from
room
to
room
,
roam
along
passage
,
sit
now
for
ten
minute
in
the
gallery
,
and
then
again
for
a
short
space
in
the
body
of
the
House
,
 
till
he
would
get
up
and
wander
again
out
into
the
lobby
,
impatient
of
the
neighbourhood
of
Mr.
Bott
.
<EOS>
certainly
just
at
this
time
he
feel
no
desire
to
bring
before
the
House
the
subject
of
the
River
Embankment
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
Mr.
Grey
much
happy
when
he
be
leave
alone
,
than
be
his
assailant
.
<EOS>
to
give
Vavasor
his
due
,
the
memory
of
the
affray
itself
do
not
long
trouble
him
much
.
<EOS>
the
success
between
the
combatant
have
be
nearly
equal
,
and
he
have
,
at
any
rate
,
speak
his
mind
freely
.
<EOS>
His
misery
have
come
from
other
source
.
<EOS>
but
the
reflection
that
he
have
be
concern
in
a
row
be
in
itself
enough
to
make
John
Grey
wretche
for
the
time
.
<EOS>
such
a
misfortune
have
never
hitherto
befall
him
.
<EOS>
in
all
his
dealing
with
man
word
have
be
sufficient
,
and
generally
word
of
courtesy
have
suffice
.
<EOS>
to
have
be
personally
engage
in
a
fighting
scramble
with
such
a
man
as
George
Vavasor
be
to
him
terrible
.
<EOS>
when
order
that
his
money
may
be
expend
with
the
possible
object
of
save
Alice
from
her
cousin
,
he
have
never
feel
a
moment
's
regret
;
he
have
never
think
that
he
be
do
more
than
circumstance
fairly
demand
of
him
.
<EOS>
but
now
he
be
almost
drive
to
utter
reproach
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Alice
!
<EOS>
that
this
thing
should
have
come
upon
me
through
thy
fault
!
"
  
<EOS>
when
Vavasor
be
lead
away
down
stair
by
the
tailor
,
and
Grey
find
that
no
more
actual
fighting
would
be
require
of
him
,
he
retire
into
his
bedroom
,
that
he
may
wash
his
mouth
and
free
himself
from
the
stain
of
the
combat
.
<EOS>
He
have
hear
the
front
door
close
,
and
know
that
the
miscreant
be
go
,
 
the
miscreant
who
have
disturb
his
quiet
.
<EOS>
then
he
begin
to
think
what
be
the
accusation
with
which
Vavasor
have
charge
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
tell
that
he
have
advanced
money
on
behalf
of
Alice
,
in
order
that
he
may
obtain
some
power
over
Alice
's
fortune
,
and
thus
revenge
himself
upon
Alice
for
her
treatment
of
him
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
damnably
false
than
this
accusation
.
<EOS>
of
that
he
be
well
aware
.
<EOS>
but
be
not
the
circumstance
of
a
nature
to
make
it
appear
that
the
accusation
be
true
?
<EOS>
security
for
the
money
advance
by
him
,
of
course
,
he
have
none
;
 
<EOS>
of
course
he
have
desire
none
;
 
of
course
the
money
have
be
give
out
of
his
own
pocket
with
the
sole
object
of
save
Alice
,
if
that
may
be
possible
;
but
of
all
those
who
may
hear
of
this
affair
,
how
many
would
know
or
even
guess
the
truth
?
  
<EOS>
while
he
be
in
this
wretched
state
of
mind
,
wash
his
mouth
,
and
disturb
his
spirit
,
Mr.
Jones
,
his
landlord
,
come
up
to
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Jones
have
know
him
for
some
year
,
and
entertain
a
most
profound
respect
for
his
character
.
<EOS>
a
rather
sport
man
than
otherwise
be
Mr.
Jones
.
<EOS>
His
father
have
be
a
tradesman
at
Cambridge
,
and
in
this
way
Jones
have
become
known
to
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
but
though
give
to
sport
,
by
which
he
mean
modern
prize
-
fighting
and
the
Epsom
course
on
the
Derby
day
,
Mr.
Jones
be
a
man
who
dearly

<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
,
with
his
property
at
Nethercoats
,
and
his
august
manner
,
and
his
reputation
at
Cambridge
,
be
a
most
respectable
lodger
,
and
Mr.
Jones
could
hardly
understand
how
any
one
could
presume
to
raise
his
hand
against
such
a
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
,
dear
,
sir
 
this
be
a
terrible
affair
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
as
he
make
his
way
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
disagreeable

certainly

Grey

yes

I

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well

yes

<EOS>
I
should
not

push
him
down

have
he
not

with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
have
the
police
after
him
if
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

"
  
<EOS>
"
or
we
may
manage
to
polish
him
off
in
any

you
know

"
  
<EOS>
It
be
some
time
before
Mr.
Grey
could
get
rid
of
the
tailor
,
but
he
do
so
at
last
without
have
tell
any
part
of
the
story
to
that
warlike
,
worthy
,
and
very
anxious
individual
.
   
<EOS>
the
last
will
of
the
Old
Squire
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
Kate
Vavasor
be
live
down
in
Westmoreland
,
with
no
other
society
than
that
of
her
grandfather
,
and
do
not
altogether
have
a
very
pleasant
life
of
it
.
<EOS>
George
have
be
apt
to
represent
the
old
man
to
himself
as
be
as
strong
as
an
old
tower
,
which
,
though
it
be
but
a
ruin
,
show
no
sign
of
fall
.
<EOS>
to
his
eye
the
Squire
have
always
seem
to
be
full
of
life
and
power
.
<EOS>
He
could
be
violent
on
occasion
,
and
be
hardly
ever
without
violence
in
his
eye
and
voice
.
<EOS>
but
George
's
opinion
be
form
by
his
wish
,
or
rather
by
the
reverse
of
his
wish
.
<EOS>
for
year
he
have
be
long
that
his
grandfather
should
die
,
 
have
be
accuse
Fate
of
gross
injustice
in
that
she
do
not
snap
the
thread
;
and
with
such
thought
in
his
mind
he
have
grudge
every
ounce
which
the
Squire
's
vigour
have
be
able
to
sustain
.
<EOS>
He
have
almost
teach
himself
to
believe
that
it
would
be
a
good
deed
to
squeeze
what
remain
of
life
out
of
that
violent
old
throat
.
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
the
ember
of
life
be
burn
low
;
and
have
George
know
all
the
truth
,
he
would
hardly
have
incline
his
mind
to
thought
of
murder
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
,
indeed
,
very
weak
with
age
,
and
totter
with
unsteady
step
on
the
brink
of
his
grave
,
though
he
would
still
come
down
early
from
his
room
,
and
would
,
if
possible
,
creep
out
about
the
garden
and
into
the
farmyard
.
<EOS>
He
would
still
sit
down
to
dinner
,
and
would
drink
his
allot
portion
of
port
wine
,
in
the
doctor
's
tooth
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
by
no
means
desire
to
rob
him
of
his
last
luxury
,
or
even
to
stint
his
quantity
;
but
he
recommend
certain
change
in
the
mode
and
time
of
take
it
.
<EOS>
against
this
,
however
,
the
old
Squire
indignantly
rebel
,
and
scold
Kate
almost
off
her
leg
when
she
attempt
to
enforce
the
doctor
's
order
.
<EOS>
"
what
the
mischief
do
it
signify
,
"
the
old
man
say
to
her
one
evening
;
 
"
what
difference
will
it
make
whether
I
be
dead
or
alive
,
unless
it
be
that
George
would
turn
you
out
of
the
house
<EOS>
directly
he
get
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
think
of
any
one
but
yourself
,
sir
,
"
say
Kate
,
with
a
tear
in
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
be
troubled
to
think
of
me
much
longer
,
"
say
the
Squire
;
and
then
he
gulp
down
the
remain
half
of
his
glass
of
wine
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
be
,
in
truth
,
very
good
to
him
.
<EOS>
woman
always
be
good
under
such
circumstance
;
and
Kate
Vavasor
be
one
who
would
certainly
stick
to
such
duty
as
now
fall
to
her
lot
.
<EOS>
She
be
eminently
true
and
loyal
to
her
friend
,
though
she
could
be
as
false
on
their
behalf
as
most
false
people
can
be
on
their
own
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
good
to
the
old
man
,
tend
all
his
want
,
take
his
violence
with
good
-
humour
rather
than
with
submission
,
not
oppose
him
with
direct
contradiction
when
he
abuse
his
grandson
,
but
say
little
word
to
mitigate
his
wrath
,
if
it
be
possible
.
<EOS>
at
such
time
the
Squire
would
tell
her
that
she
also
would
learn
to
know
her
brother
's
character
some
day
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
live
to
be
rob
by
him
,
and
turn
out
as
naked
as
you
be
bear
,
"
he
say
to
her
one
day
.
<EOS>
then
Kate
fire
up
and
declare
that
she
fully
trust
her
brother
's
love
.
<EOS>
whatever
fault
he
may
have
,
he
have
be
staunch
to
her
,
<EOS>
so
she
say
,
and
<EOS>
the
old
man
sneer
at
her
for
say
so
.
  
<EOS>
one
morning
,
soon
after
this
,
when
she
bring
him
up
to
his
bedroom
some
mixture
of
thin
porridge
,
which
he
still
endeavour
to
swallow
for
his
breakfast
,
he
bid
her
sit
down
,
and
begin
to
talk
to
her
about
the
property
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
be
a
fool
,
"
he
say
,
"
about
all
matter
of
business
;
 
more
of
a
fool
than
even
woman
generally
be
.
"
<EOS>
to
this
Kate
accede
with
a
little
smile
,
 
acknowledge
that
her
understanding
be
limited
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
see
Gogram
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
write
to
him
a
line
,
tell
him
to
come
here
to
-
day
,
 
he
or
one
of
his
man
,
 
and
send
it
at
once
by
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
Gogram
be
an
attorney
who
live
at
Penrith
,
and
who
be
never

to
Vavasor
Hall
unless
the
Squire
have
something
to
say
about
his
will
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
you
would
better
put
it
off
till
you
be
a
little
strong
?
"
say
Kate
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
Squire
fire
at
her
such
a
volley
of
oath
that
she
spring
off
the
chair
on
which
she
be
sit
,
and
dart
across
to
a
little
table
at
which
there
be
pen
and
ink
,
and
write
her
note
to
Mr.
Gogram
,
before
she
have
recover
from
the
shaking
which
the
battery
have
give
her
.
<EOS>
She
write
the
note
,
and
run
away
with
it
to
Peter
,
and
see
Peter
on
the
pony
on
his
way
to
Penrith
,
before
she
dare
to
return
to
her
grandfather
's
bedside
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
should
you
do
with
the
estate
if
I
leave
it
you
?
"
<EOS>
the
Squire
say
to
her
the
first
moment
she
be
again
back
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
question
she
could
not
answer
instantly
.
<EOS>
She
stand
by
his
bedside
for
a
while
thinking
,
 
hold
her
grandfather
's
hand
and
look
down
upon
the
bed
.
<EOS>
He
,
with
his
rough
watery
old
eye
,
be
gaze
up
into
her
face
,
as
though
he
be
try
to
read
her
thought
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
should
give
it
to
my
brother
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
be
d
 
---
if
I
will
leave
it
to
you
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
jump
now
,
though
he
have
swear
at
her
.
<EOS>
She
still
stand
,
hold
his
hand
softly
,
and
look
down
upon
the
bed
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
be
you
,
grandfather
,
"
she
say
almost
in
a
whisper
,
"
I
would
not
trust
myself
to
alter
family
arrangement
whilst
I
be
ill
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
would
advise
any
one
else
against
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
if
I
be
to
leave
it
to
Alice
,
she
would
give
it
to
him
too
,
"
he
say
,
speak
his
thought
out
loud
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
it
be
<EOS>
you
see
in
him
,
I
never
could
even
guess
.
<EOS>
He
be
as
ugly
as
a
baboon
,
with
his
scar
face
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
do
anything
to
show
himself
a
clever
fellow
.
<EOS>
Kate
,
give
me
some
of
that
bottle
the
man
send
.
"
<EOS>
Kate
hand
him
his
medicine
,
and
then
stand
again
by
his
bedside
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
do
he
get
the
money
to
pay
for
his
election
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Squire
ask
,
as
soon
as
he
have
swallow
the
draught
.
<EOS>
"
They
would
not
give
such
a
one
as
him
credit
a
yard
further
than
they
could
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
where
he
get
it
,
"
say
Kate
,
lie
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
not
have
yours
;
have
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
would
not
take
it
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
offer
it
to
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
he
have
not
have
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
a
penny
of
it
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
make
you
offer
it
to
him
after
what
I
say
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
it
be
my
own
,
"
say
Kate
,
stoutly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
the
big
idiot
that
ever
I
hear
of
,
and
you
will
know
it
yourself
some
day
.
<EOS>
go
away
now
,
and
let
me
know
when
Gogram
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
go
away
,
and
for
a
time
employ
herself
about
her
ordinary
household
work
.
<EOS>
then
she
sit
down
alone
in
the
dingy
old
dining
-
room
,
to
think
what
have
better
be
do
in
her
present
circumstance
.
<EOS>
the
carpet
of
the
room
be
wear
out
,
as
be
also
the
cover
of
the
old
chair
and
the
horsehair
sofa
which
be
never
move
from
its
accustomed
place
along
the
wall
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
comfortable
Squire
's
residence
,
this
old
house
at
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
in
the
last
twenty
year
no
money
have
be
spend
on
furniture
or
embellishment
,
and
for
the
last
ten
year
there
have
be
no
painting
,
either
inside
or
out
.
<EOS>
twenty
year
ago
the
Squire
have
be
an
embarrassed
man
,
and
have
take
a
turn
in
his
life
and
have
live
sparingly
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
say
that
he
have
become
a
miser
.
<EOS>
His
table
be
keep
plentifully
,
and
there
have
never
be
want
in
his
house
.
<EOS>
in
some
respect
,
too
,
he
have
behave
liberally
to
Kate
and
to
other
,
and
he
have
keep
up
the
timber
and
fence
on
the
property
.
<EOS>
but
the
house
have
become
wretched
in
its
dull
,
sombre
,
dirty
darkness
,
and
the
gardens
round
it
be
as
bad
.
  
<EOS>
what
ought
she
now
to
do
?
<EOS>
She
believe
that
her
grandfather
's
last
day
be
come
,
and
she
know
that
other
of
the
family
should
be
with
him
besides
herself
.
<EOS>
for
their
sake
,
for
his
,
and
for
her
own
,
it
would
be
proper
that
she
should
not
be
alone
there
when
he
die
.
<EOS>
but
for
whom
should
she
send
?
<EOS>
Her
brother
be
the
natural
heir
,
and
would
be
the
head
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
Her
duty
to
him
be
clear
,
and
the
more
so
as
her
grandfather
be
at
this
moment
speak
of
change
in
his
will
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
question
to
her
whether
George
's
presence
at
Vavasor
,
even
if
he
would
come
,
would
not
at
this
moment
do
more
harm
than
good
to
his
own
interest
.
<EOS>
It
would
make
some
prejudicial
change
in
the
old
man
's
will
more
probable
instead
of
less
so
.
<EOS>
George
would
not
become
soft
and
mild
-
spoken
even
by
a
death
-
bed
side
,
and
it
would
be
likely
enough
that
the
Squire
would
curse
his
heir
with
his
die
breath
.
<EOS>
She
may
send
for
her
uncle
John
;
but
if
she
do
so
without
tell
George
she
would
be
treat
George
unfairly
;
and
she
know
that
it
be
improbable
that
her
uncle
and
her
brother
should
act
together
in
anything
.
<EOS>
Her
aunt
Greenow
,
she
think
,
would
come
to
her
,
and
her
presence
would
not
influence
the
Squire
in
any
way
with
reference
to
the
property
.
<EOS>
so
she
make
up
her
mind
at
last
that
she
would
ask
her
aunt
to
come
to
Vavasor
,
and
that
she
would
tell
her
brother
accurately
all
that
she
could
tell
,
 
leave
him
to
come
or
stay
,
as
he
may
think
.
<EOS>
Alice
would
,
no
doubt
,
learn
all
the
fact
from
him
,
and
her
uncle
John
would
hear
them
from
Alice
.
<EOS>
then
they
could
do
as
they
please
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Mr.
Gogram
have
be
there
she
would
write
her
letter
,
and
they
should
be
send
over
to
Shap
early
on
the
follow
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gogram
come
and
be
closet
with
the
Squire
,
and
the
doctor
also
come
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
see
Kate
,
and
,
shake
his
head
,
tell
her
that
her
grandfather
be
sink
low
and
low
every
hour
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
infinitely
well
for
him
if
he
would
take
that
port
wine
at
four
dose
in
the
day
,
or
even
at
two
,
instead
of
take
it
all
together
.
<EOS>
Kate
promise
to
try
again
,
but
state
her
conviction
that
the
trial
would
be
useless
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
when
press
on
the
matter
,
say
that
his
patient
may
probably
live
a
week
,
not
improbably
a
fortnight
,
 
perhaps
a
month
,
if
he
would
be
obedient
,
 
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
Gogram
go
away
without
see
Kate
;
and
Kate
,
who
look
upon
a
will
as
an
awful
and
somewhat
tedious
ceremony
,
be
in
doubt
whether
her
grandfather
would
live
to
complete
any
new
operation
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
truth
,
the
will
have
be
make
and
sign
and
witness
,
 
the
parish
clerk
and
one
of
the
tenant
have
be
have
up
into
the
room
as
witness
.
<EOS>
Kate
know
that
the
man
have
be
there
,
but
still
do
not
think
that
a
new
will
have
be
perfect
.
  
<EOS>
that
evening
when
it
be
dusk
the
Squire
come
into
the
dining
-
room
,
have
be
shuffle
about
the
grand
sweep
before
the
house
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
the
day
be
cold
and
the
wind
bleak
,
but
still
he
would
go
out
,
and
Kate
have
wrap
him
up
carefully
in
muffler
and
great
-
coat
.
<EOS>
now
he
come
in
to
what
he
call
dinner
,
and
Kate
sit
down
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
drink
no
wine
that
day
,
although
she
have
bring
it
to
him
twice
during
the
morning
.
<EOS>
now
he
attempt
to
swallow
a
little
soup
,
but
fail
;
and
after
that
,
while
Kate
be
eat
her
bit
of
chicken
,
have
the
decanter
put
before
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
eat
,
and
I
suppose
it
will
not
hurt
you
if
I
take
my
wine
at
once
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
It
go
against
the
grain
with
him
,
even
yet
,
that
he
could
not
wait
till
the
cloth
be
go
from
the
table
,
but
his
impatience
for
the
only
sustenance
that
he
could
take
be
too
much
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
should
eat
something
,
sir
;
will
you
have
a
bit
of
toast
to
sop
in
your
wine
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
word
"
sop
"
be
badly
choose
,
and
make
the
old
Squire
angry
.
"
<EOS>
sop
toast
!
<EOS>
why
be
I
to
spoil
the
only
thing
I
can
enjoy
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
the
wine
would
do
you
more
good
if
you
would
take
something
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
!
<EOS>
nothing
will
do
me
any
good
any
more
.
<EOS>
as
for
eat
,
you
know
I
can
not
eat
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of
bother
me
?
"
<EOS>
then
he
fill
his
second
glass
,
and
pause
awhile
before
he
put
it
to
his
lip
.
<EOS>
He
never
exceed
four
glass
,
but
the
four
he
be
determine
that
he
would
have
,
as
long
as
he
could
lift
them
to
his
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
finish
,
or
pretend
to
finish
,
her
dinner
within
five
minute
,
in
order
that
the
table
may
be
make
to
look
comfortable
for
him
.
<EOS>
then
she
poke
the
fire
,
and
brush
up
the
hearth
,
and
close
the
old
curtain
with
her
own
hand
,
move
about
silently
.
<EOS>
as
she
move
his
eye
follow
her
,
and
when
she
come
behind
his
chair
,
and
push
the
decanter
a
little
more
within
his
reach
,
he
put
out
his
rough
,
hairy
hand
,
and
lay
it
upon
one
of
hers
which
she
have
rest
on
the
table
,
with
a
tenderness
that
be
unusual
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
good
girl
,
Kate
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
have
be
a
boy
,
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
have
,
I
should
not
,
perhaps
,
have
be
here
to
take
care
of
you
,
"
she
say
,
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
you
would
have
be
like
your
brother
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
think
there
could
have
be
two
so
bad
as
he

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh

grandfather
,
if
he
have
offend
you
,
you
should
try
to
forgive
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
try
to
forgive
him
!
<EOS>
how
often
have
I
forgive
him
without
any
try
?
<EOS>
why
do
he
come
down
here
the
other
day
,
and
insult
me
for
the
last
time
?
<EOS>
why
do
not
he
keep
away
,
as
I
have
bid
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
give
him
leave
to
see
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
give
him
leave
to
treat
me
like
that
.
<EOS>
never
mind
;
he
will
find
that
,
old
as
I
be
,
I
can
punish
an
insult
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
do
anything
,
sir
,
to
injure
him
?
"
say
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
make
another
will
,
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
do
you
suppose
I
have
that
man
here
all
the
way
from

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
not
do
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
it
be
do
.
<EOS>
if
I
leave
him
the
whole
property
it
would
be
go
in
two
year
"
time
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of
do
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
for
his
life
,
sir
!
<EOS>
You
have
promise
him
that
he
should
have
it
for
his
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
dare
you
tell
me
that
?
<EOS>
I
never
promise
him
.
<EOS>
as
my
heir
,
he
would
have
have
it
all
,
if
he
would
have
behave
himself
with
common
decency
.
<EOS>
even
though
I
dislike
him
,
as
I
always
have
do
,
he
should
have
have
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
have
take
it
from
him
altogether
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
answer
no
question
about
it
,
Kate
.
"
<EOS>
then
a
fit
of
coughing
come
upon
him
,
his
four
glass
of
wine
have
be
all
take
,
and
there
be
no
further
talk
about
business
.
<EOS>
during
the
evening
Kate
read
a
chapter
of
the
Bible
out
loud
.
<EOS>
but
the
Squire
be
very
impatient
under
the
reading
,
and
positively
refuse
permission
for
a
second
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
not
any
good
in
so
much
of
it
,
all
at
once
,
"
he
say
,
use
almost
exactly
the
same
word
which
Kate
have
use
to
him
about
the
port
wine
.
<EOS>
there
may
have
be
good
produce
by
the
small
quantity
to
which
he
listen
,
as
there
be
good
from
the
physic
which
child
take
with
wry
face
,
most
unwillingly
.
<EOS>
who
can
say
?
  
<EOS>
for
many
week
past
Kate
have
beg
her
uncle
to
allow
the
clergyman
of
Vavasor
to
come
to
him
;
but
he
have
positively
decline
.
<EOS>
the
vicar
be
a
young
man
to
whom
the
living
have
lately
be
give
by
the
Chancellor
,
and
he
have
commence
his
career
by
give
instant
offence
to
the
Squire
.
<EOS>
this
vicar
's
predecessor
have
be
an
old
man
,
almost
as
old
as
the
Squire
himself
,
and
have
hold
the
living
for
forty
year
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
a
Westmoreland
man
,
have
read
the
prayer
and
preach
his
one
Sunday
sermon
in
a
Westmoreland
dialect
,
get
through
the
whole
operation
rather
within
an
hour
and
a
quarter
.
<EOS>
He
have
trouble
none
of
his
parishioner
by
much
advice
,
and
have
be
meek
and
obedient
to
the
Squire
.
<EOS>
know
the
country
well
,
and
be
use
to
its
habit
,
he
have
live
,
and
be
charitable
too
,
on
the
proceed
of
his
living
,
which
have
never
reach
two
hundred
a
year
.
<EOS>
but
the
new
comer
be
a
close
-
fisted
man
,
with
high
idea
of
personal
comfort
,
who
find
it
necessary
to
make
every
penny
go
as
far
as
possible
,
who
make
up
in
preach
for
what
he
could
not
give
away
in
charity
;
who
establish
an
afternoon
service
,
and
who
have
rebuke
the
Squire
for
say
that
the
do
so
be
trash
and
nonsense
.
<EOS>
since
that
the
Squire
have
never
be
inside
the
church
,
except
on
the
occasion
of
Christmas
-
day
.
<EOS>
for
this
,
indeed
,
the
state
of
his
health
give
ample
excuse
;
but
he
have
positively
refuse
to
see
the
vicar
,
though
that
gentleman
have
assiduously
call
,
and
have
at
last
desire
the
servant
to
tell
the
clergyman
not
to
come
again
unless
he
be
send
for
.
<EOS>
Kate
's
task
be
,
therefore
,
difficult
,
both
as
regard
the
temporal
and
spiritual
want
of
her
grandfather
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
reading
be
finish
,
the
old
man
doze
in
his
chair
for
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
go
up
to
bed
before
the
enjoyment
of
that
luxury
.
<EOS>
He
be
daily
implore
to
do
so
,
because
that
sleep
in
the
chair
interfere
so
fatally
with
his
chance
of
sleep
in
bed
.
<EOS>
but
sleep
in
his
chair
he
would
and
do
.
<EOS>
then
he
wake
,
and
after
a
fit
of
coughing
,
be
induce
,
with
much
ill
-
humour
,
to
go
up
to
his
room
.
<EOS>
Kate
have
never
see
him
so
weak
.
<EOS>
He
be
hardly
able
,
even
with
her
assistance
and
that
of
the
old
servant
,
to
get
up
the
broad
stair
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
still
some
power
leave
to
him
for
violence
of
language
after
he
get
to
his
room
,
and
he
rate
Kate
and
the
old
woman
loudly
,
because
his
slipper
be
not
in
the
proper
place
.
<EOS>
"
Grandfather
,
"
say
Kate
,
"
would
you
like
me
to
stay
in
the
room
with
you
to
-
night
?
"
<EOS>
He
rate
her
again
for
this
proposition
,
and
then
,
with
assistance
from
the
nurse
,
he
be
get
into
bed
and
be
leave
alone
.
  
<EOS>
after
that
Kate
go
to
her
own
room
and
write
her
letter
.
<EOS>
the
first
she
write
be
to
her
aunt
Greenow
.
<EOS>
that
be
easily
enough
write
.
<EOS>
to
Mrs.
Greenow
it
be
not
necessary
that
she
should
say
anything
about
money
.
<EOS>
She
simply
state
her
belief
that
her
grandfather
's
last
day
be
near
at
hand
,
and
beg
her
aunt
to
come
and
pay
a
last
visit
to
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
a
great
comfort
to
me
in
my
distress
,
"
she
say
;
"
and
it
will
be
a
satisfaction
to
you
to
have
see
your
father
again
.
"
<EOS>
She
know
that
her
aunt
would
come
,
and
that
task
be
soon
do
.
  
<EOS>
but
her
letter
to
her
brother
be
much
more
difficult
.
<EOS>
what
should
she
tell
him
,
and
what
should
she
not
tell
him
?
<EOS>
She
begin
by
describe
her
grandfather
's
state
,
and
by
say
to
him
,
as
she
have
do
to
Mrs.
Greenow
,
that
she
believe
the
old
man
's
hour
be
well
-
nigh
come
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
She
tell
him
that
she
have
ask
her
aunt
to
come
to
her
;
"
not
,
"
she
say
,
"
that
I
think
her
come
will
be
of
material
service
,
but
I
feel
the
loneliness
of
the
house
will
be
too
much
for
me
at
such
a
time
.
<EOS>
I
must
leave
it
for
you
to
decide
,
"
she
say
,
"
whether
you
have
better
be
here
.
<EOS>
if
anything
should
happen
,
"
 
people
when
write
such
letter
be
always
afraid
to
speak
of
death
by
its
proper
name
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
send
you
a
message
,
and
no
doubt
you
would
come
at
once
.
"
<EOS>
then
come
the
question
of
the
will
.
<EOS>
have
it
not
occur
to
her
that
her
own
interest
be
involve
she
would
have
say
nothing
on
the
subject
;
but
she
fear
her
brother
,
 
fear
even
his
misconstruction
of
her
motive
,
even
though
she
be
willing
to
sacrifice
so
much
on
his
behalf
,
 
and
therefore
she
resolve
to
tell
him
all
that
she
know
.
<EOS>
He
may
turn
upon
her
hereafter
if
she
do
not
do
so
,
and
accuse
her
of
a
silence
which
have
be
prejudicial
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
so
she
tell
it
all
,
and
the
letter
become
long
in
the
telling
.
<EOS>
"
I
write
with
a
heavy
heart
,
"
she
say
,
"
because
I
know
it
will
be
a
great
blow
to
you
.
<EOS>
He
give
me
to
understand
that
in
this
will
he
leave
everything
away
from
you
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
declare
that
he
say
so
directly
.
<EOS>
indeed
I
can
not
remember
his
word
;
but
that
be
the
impression
he
leave
on
me
.
<EOS>
the
day
before
he
have
ask
me
what
I
should
do
if
he
give
me
the
estate
;
but
of
course
I
treat
that
as
a
joke
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
idea
what
he
put
into
his
will
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
even
attempt
to
guess
.
<EOS>
but
now
I
have
tell
you
all
that
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
the
letter
be
a
very
long
one
,
and
be
not
finish
till
late
;
but
when
it
be
complete
she
have
the
two

out
into
the
kitchen
,
as

<EOS>
early
on

and
at

and
at

<EOS>
then
he
have
seem
to
go
to

four
or
five
time
in
the
course
of
the
morning
<EOS>
Kate

into
the
room

but
her
grandfather
do
not
notice
her
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
fear
he
may
already
have
pass
away
,
and
she
put
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
down
his
arm
.
<EOS>
He
then
gently
touch
her
hand
with
his

plainly
that

,
but
conscious

<EOS>
She

which

and
the

<EOS>
She

<EOS>
at

but
she
see
word
in
it
that
make
her
wish
to
know
its
content
as
quickly
as
possible

<EOS>
but
she

.
<EOS>
at

,
even
though
the
circumstance
of
the
case
be
of
a
kind
to
create
no
agony
of
grief
.
<EOS>
the
old
man
who
have
just
pass
away
up
-
stair
be
fully
due
to
go
.
<EOS>
He
have
live
his
span
all
out
,
and
have
himself
know
that
to
die
be
the
one
thing
leave
for
him
to
do
.
<EOS>
Kate
also
have
expect
his
death
,
and
have
feel
that
the
time
have
come
in
which
it
would
be
foolish
even
to
wish
that
it
should
be
arrest
.
<EOS>
but
death
close
to
one
be
always
sad
as
it
be
solemn
.
  
<EOS>
and
she
be
quite
alone
at
Vavasor
Hall
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
acquaintance
within
some
mile
of
her
.
<EOS>
from
the
young
vicar
,
though
she
herself
have
not
quarrel
with
him
,
she
could
receive
no
comfort
,
as
she
hardly
know
him
;
nor
be
she
of
a
temperament
which
would
dispose
her
to
turn
to
a
clergyman
at
such
a
time
for
comfort
,
unless
to
one
who
may
have
be
an
old
friend
.
<EOS>
Her
aunt
and
brother
would
probably
both
come
to
her
,
but
they
could
hardly
be
with
her
for
a
day
or
two
,
and
during
that
day
or
two
it
would
be
needful
that
order
should
be
give
which
it
be
disagreeable
for
a
woman
to
have
to
give
.
<EOS>
the
servant
,
moreover
,
in
the
house
be
hardly
fit
to
assist
her
much
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
old
butler
,
or
footman
,
who
have
live
at
the
Hall
for
more
than
fifty
year
,
but
he
be
cripple
with
rheumatism
,
and
so
laden
with
malady
,
that
he
rarely
creep
out
of
his
own
room
.
<EOS>
He
be
simply
an
additional
burden
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
boy
who
have
lately
do
all
the
work
which
the
other
should
have
do
,
and
ever
so
much
more
beside
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
know
how
much
work
such
a
boy
will
do
when
properly
drill
,
and
he
be
now
Kate
's
good
minister
in
her
distress
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
old
nurse
,
 
but
she
have
be
simply
good
for
nursing
,
and
there
be
two
rough
Westmoreland
girl
who
call
themselves
cook
and
housemaid
.
  
<EOS>
on
that
first
evening
,
 
the
very
day
on
which
her
grandfather
have
die
,
 
Kate
would
have
be
more
comfortable
have
she
really
find
something
that
she
could
do
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
in
truth
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
hover
for
an
hour
or
two
in
and
out
of
the
room
,
conscious
of
the
letter
which
she
have
in
her
pocket
,
and
very
desirous
in
heart
of
read
it
,
but
restrain
by
a
feeling
that
at
such
a
moment
she
ought
to
think
only
of
the
dead
.
<EOS>
in
this
she
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
let
the
living
think
of
the
dead
,
when
their
thought
will
travel
that
way
whether
the
thinker
wish
it
or
no
.
<EOS>
Grief
take
up
because
grief
be
suppose
to
be
proper
,
be
only
one
degree
well
than
pretend
grief
.
<EOS>
when
one
see
it
,
one
can
not
but
think
of
the
lady
who
ask
her
friend
,
in
confidence
,
whether
hot
roast
fowl
and
bread
-
sauce
be
compatible
with
the
early
state
of
weed
;
or
of
that
other
lady
,
 
a
royal
lady
<EOS>
she
,
 
who
be
much
comfort
in
the
tedium
of
her
trouble
when
assure
by
one
of
the
lord
about
the
Court
that
piquet
be
mourn
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
late
at
night
,
near
eleven
,
before
Kate
take
out
her
letter
and
read
it
.
<EOS>
as
something
of
my
story
hang
upon
it
,
I
will
give
it
at
length
,
though
it
be
a
long
letter
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
write
with
great
struggle
,
and
with
many
tear
,
and
<EOS>
Kate
,
as
she
read
it
to
the
end
,
almost
forget
that
her
grandfather
be
lie
dead
in
the
room
above
her

<EOS>
DEAREST
KATE
,
  
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
how
to
write
to
you
 
what
I
have
to
tell
,
and
yet
I
must
tell
it
.
<EOS>
I
must
tell
it
to
you
,
but
I
shall
never
repeat
the
story
to
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
write
yesterday
,
when
it
occur
,
but
I
be
so
ill
that
I
feel
myself
unable
to
make
the
exertion
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
at
one
time
,
after
your
brother
have
leave
me
,
I
almost
doubt
whether
I
should
ever
be
able
to
collect
my
thought
again
.
<EOS>
My
dismay
be
at
first
<EOS>
so
great
that
my
reason
for
a
time
desert
me
,
and
I
could
only
sit
and
cry
like
an
idiot
.
  
<EOS>
Dear
Kate
,
I
hope
you
will
not
be
angry
with
me
for
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
endeavour
to
think
about
it
as
calmly
as
I
can
,
and
I
believe
that
I
have
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
the
fact
that
your
brother
have
quarrel
with
me
can
not
be
conceal
from
you
,
and
I
must
not
leave
him
to
tell
you
of
the
manner
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
come
to
me
yesterday
in
great
anger
.
<EOS>
His
anger
then
be
nothing
to
what
it
become
afterwards
;
but
even
when
he
first
come
in
he
be
full
of
wrath
.
<EOS>
He
stand
up
before
me
,
and
ask
me
how
it
have
come
to
pass
that
I
have
send
him
the
money
which
he
have
ask
of
me
through
the
hand
of
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
have
not
do
this
,
and
so
I
tell
him
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
have
speak
of
the
matter
to
no
one
but
papa
,
and
he
have
manage
it
for
me
.
<EOS>
even
now
I
know
nothing
of
it
,
and
as
I
have
not
yet
speak
to
papa
<EOS>
I
can
not
understand
it
.
<EOS>
George
at
once
tell
me
that
he
disbelieve
me
,
and
when
I
sit
quiet
under
this
insult
,
he
use
harsh
word
,
and
say
that
I
have
conspire
to
lower
him
before
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
ask
me
whether
I
love
him
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Kate
,
I
must
tell
it
you
all
,
though
it
be
dreadful
to
me
that
I
should
have
to
write
it
.
<EOS>
You
remember
how
it
come
to
pass
when
we
be
in
Westmoreland
together
at
Christmas
?
<EOS>
do
not
think
that
I
be
blame
you
,
but
I
be
very
rash
then
in
the
answer
which
I
make
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
I
could
be
useful
to
him
as
his
wife
,
and
I
have
tell
myself
that
it
would
be
good
that
I
should
be
of
use
in
some
way
.
<EOS>
when
he
ask
me
that
question
yesterday
,
I
sit
silent
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
how
could
I
have
answer
it
in
the
affirmative
,
when
he
have
just
use
such
language
to
me
,
 
while
he
be
stand
opposite
to
me
,
look
at
me
in
that
way
which
he
have
when
he
be
enrage
?
<EOS>
then
he
speak
again
and
demand
of
me
that
I
should
at
once
send
back
to
Mr.
Grey
all
present
of
his
which
I
have
keep
,
and
at
the
same
time
take
up
and
throw
across
the
table
on
to
the
sofa
near
me
,
a
little
paper
knife
which
Mr.
Grey
once
give
me
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
allow
myself
to
be
so
order
by
him
;
so
I
say
nothing
,
but
put
the
knife
back
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
He
then
take
it
again
and
throw
it
beneath
the
grate
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
right
to
look
upon
you
as
my
wife
,
"
he
say
,
"
and
,
as
such
,
I
will
not
allow
you
to
keep
that
man
's
thing
about
you
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
tell
him
then
that
I
should
never
become
his
wife
,
but
though
I
remember
many
of
his
word
,
I
remember
none
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
He
swear
,
I
know
,
with
a
great
oath
,
that
if
I
go
back
a
second
time
from
my
word
to
him
he
would
leave
me
no
peace
,
 
that
he
would
punish
me
for
my
perfidy
with
some
fearful
punishment
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Kate
,
I
can
not
tell
you
what
he
look
like
.
<EOS>
He
have
then
come
quite
close
to
me
,
and
I
know
that
I
tremble
before
him
as
though
he
be
go
to
strike
me
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
what
could
I
say
to
a
man
who
behave
to
me
in
such
a
manner
?
<EOS>
then
,
as
far
as
I
can
remember
it
,
he
sit
down
and
begin
to
talk
about
money
.
<EOS>
I
forget
what
he
say
at
first
,
but
I
know
that
I
assure
him
that
he
may
take
what
he
want
so
long
as
enough
be
leave
to
prevent
my
be
absolutely
a
burden
on
papa
.
<EOS>
"
that
,
madam
,
be
a
matter
of
course
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
I
remember
those
word
so
well
.
<EOS>
then
he
explain
that
after
what
have
pass
between
us
,
I
have
no
right
to
ruin
him
by
keep
back
from
him
money
which
have
be
promise
to
him
,
and
which
be
essential
to
his
success
.
<EOS>
in
this
,
dear
Kate
,
I
think
he
be
mainly
right
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
have
be
right
in
put
it
to
me
in
that
hard
,
cruel
manner
,
especially
as
I
have
never
refuse
anything
that
he
have
ask
of
me
in
respect
of
money
.
<EOS>
the
money
he
may
have
while
it
last
;
but
then
there
must
be
an
end
of
it
all
between
us
,
even
though
he
should
have
the
power
of
punish
me
,
as
he
say
he
will
do
.
<EOS>
punish
me
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
what
punishment
can
be
so
hard
as
that
which
he
have
already
inflict
?
  
<EOS>
He
then
desire
me
to
write
a
letter
to
him
which
he
may
show
to
the
lawyer
,
 
to
our
own
lawyer
,
I
think
he
mean
,
 
in
order
that
money
may
be
raise
to
pay
back
what
Mr.
Grey
have
advance
,
and
give
him
what
he
now
require
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
say
it
be
to
be
five
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
when
he
ask
this
I
do
not
move
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
be
unable
to
move
.
<EOS>
then
he
speak
very
loud
,
and
swear
at
me
again
,
and
bring
me
pen
and
ink
,
demand
that
I
should
write
the
letter
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
frightened
that
I
think
of
run
to
the
door
to
escape
,
and
I
would
have
do
so
<EOS>
have
I
not
distrust
my
own
power
.
<EOS>
have
it
be
to
save
my
life
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
write
the
letter
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
be
now
cry
,
 
at
any
rate
I
throw
myself
back
and
cover
my
face
with
my
hand
.
<EOS>
then
he
come
and
sit
by
me
,
and
take
hold
of
my
arm
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Kate
;
I
can
not
tell
it
you
all
.
<EOS>
He
put
his
mouth
close
to
my
ear
,
and
say
word
which
be
terrible
,
though
I
do
not
understand
them
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
it
be
he
say
,
but
he
be
threaten
me
with
his
anger
if
I
do
not
obey
him
.
<EOS>
before
he
leave
me
,
I
believe
I
find
my
voice
to
tell
him
that
he
should
certainly
have
the
money
which
he
require
.
<EOS>
and
so
he
shall
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
to
Mr.
Round
myself
,
and
insist
on
its
be
do
.
<EOS>
My
money
be
my
own
,
and
I
may
do
with
it
as
I
please
.
<EOS>
but
I
hope
,
 
I
be
oblige
to
hope
,
that
I
may
never
be
make
to
see
my
cousin
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
pretend
to
express
any
opinion
as
to
the
cause
of
all
this
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
possible
that
you
will
not
believe
all
I
say
,
 
that
you
will
think
that
I
be
mad
and
have
delude
myself
.
<EOS>
of
course
your
heart
will
prompt
you
to
accuse
me
rather
than
him
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
so
,
and
if
there
must
therefore
be
a
division
between
us
,
my
grief
will
be
greatly
increase
;
but
I
do
not
know
that
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
keep
all
this
back
from
you
.
<EOS>
He
have
cruelly
ill
-
use
me
and
insult
me
.
<EOS>
He
have
treat
me
as
I
should
have
think
no
man
could
have
treat
a
woman
.
<EOS>
as
regard
money
,
I
do
all
that
I
could
do
to
show
that
I
trust
him
thoroughly
,
and
my
confidence
have
only
lead
to
suspicion
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
he
understand
that
everything
must
be
over
between
us
;
but
,
if
not
,
I
must
ask
you
to
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
and
I
must
ask
you
to
explain
to
him
that
he
must
not
come
again
to
Queen
Anne
Street
.
<EOS>
if
he
do
,
nothing
shall
induce
me
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
tell
him
also
that
the
money
that
he
want
shall
assuredly
be
send
to
him
as
soon
as
I
can
make
Mr.
Round
get
it
.
  
<EOS>
Dearest
Kate
,
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
feel
for
me
.
<EOS>
if
you
do
not
answer
me
I
shall
presume
that
you
think
yourself
bind
to
support
his
side
,
and
to
believe
me
to
have
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
It
will
make
me
very
unhappy
;
but
I
shall
remember
that
you
be
his
sister
,
and
I
shall
not
be
angry
with
you
.
  
<EOS>
yours
always
affectionately
,
  
ALICE
VAVASOR
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
,
as
she
read
her
letter
through
,
at
first
quickly
,
and
then
very
slowly
,
come
by
degree
almost
to
forget
that
death
be
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
,
and
heart
,
and
brain
,
be
fill
with
thought
and
feeling
that
have
exclusive
reference
to
Alice
and
her
brother
,
and
at
last
she
find
herself
walk
the
room
with
quick
,
impetuous
step
,
while
her
blood
be
hot
with
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
all
her
sympathy
in
the
matter
be
with
Alice
.
<EOS>
It
never
occur
to
her
to
disbelieve
a
word
of
the
statement
make
to
her
,
or
to
suggest
to
herself
that
it
have
be
colour
by
any
fear
or
exaggeration
on
the
part
of
her
correspondent
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
Alice
be
true
.
<EOS>
and
,
moreover
,
much
as
she
love
her
brother
,
 
willing
as
she
have
be
and
would
still
be
to
risk
all
that
she
possess
,
and
herself
also
,
on
his
behalf
,
 
she
know
that
it
would
be
risk
and
not
trust
.
<EOS>
She
love
her
brother
,
such
love
have
come
to
her
by
nature
,
and
have
remain
with
her
from
of
old
;
and
in
his
intellect
she
still
believe
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
cease
to
have
belief
in
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
She
fear
everything
that
he
may
do
,
and
live
with
a
consciousness
that
though
she
be
willing
to
connect
all
her
own
fortune
with
his
,
she
have
much
reason
to
expect
that
she
may
encounter
ruin
in
do
so
.
<EOS>
Her
sin
have
be
in
this
,
 
that
she
have
be
anxious
to
subject
Alice
to
the
same
danger
,
 
that
she
have
intrigue
,
sometimes
very
meanly
,
to
bring
about
the
object
which
she
have
at
heart
,
 
that
she
have
use
all
her
craft
to
separate
Alice
from
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
may
be
allege
in
her
excuse
that
she
have
think
,
 
have
hope
rather
than
think
,
 
that
the
marriage
which
she
contemplate
would
change
much
in
her
brother
that
be
wrong
,
and
bring
him
into
a
mode
of
life
that
would
not
be
dangerous
.
<EOS>
may
<EOS>
not
she
and
Alice
together
so
work
upon
him
,
that
he
should
cease
to
stand
ever
on
the
brink
of
some
half
-
see
precipice
?
<EOS>
to
risk
herself
for
her
brother
be
noble
.
<EOS>
but
when
she
use
her
cunning
in
induce
her
cousin
to
share
that
risk
she
be
ignoble
.
<EOS>
of
this
she
have
herself
some
consciousness
,
as
she
walk
up
and
down
the
old
dining
-
room
at
midnight
,
hold
her
cousin
's
letter
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Her
cheek
become
tinge
with
shame
as
she
think
of
the
scene
which
Alice
have
describe
,
 
the
toy
throw
beneath
the
grate
,
the
loud
curse
,
the
whisper
threat
,
which
have
be
more
terrible
than
curse
,
the
demand
for
money
,
make
with
something
bad
than
a
cut
-
throat
's
violence
,
the
strong
man
's
hand
place
upon
the
woman
's
arm
in
anger
and
in
rage
,
those
eye
glare
,
and
the
gape
horror
of
that
still
raw
cicatrice
,
as
he
press
his
face
close
to
that
of
his
victim
!
<EOS>
not
for
a
moment
do
she
think
of
defend
him
.
<EOS>
She
accuse
him
to
herself
vehemently
of
a
sin
over
and
above
those
sin
which
have
fill
Alice
with
dismay
.
<EOS>
He
have
demand
money
from
the
girl
whom
he
intend
to
marry
!
<EOS>
accord
to
Kate
's
idea
,
nothing
could
excuse
or
palliate
this
sin
.
<EOS>
Alice
have
account
it
as
nothing
,
 
have
express
her
opinion
that
the
demand
be
reasonable
;
 
even
now
,
after
the
ill
-
usage
to
which
she
have
be
subject
,
she
have
declare
that
the
money
should
be
forthcoming
,
and
give
to
the
man
who
have
treat
her
so
shamefully
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
well
that
Alice
should
so
feel
and
so
act
,
but
it
behove
Kate
to
feel
and
act
very
differently
.
<EOS>
She
would
tell
her
brother
,
even
in
the
house
of
death
,
should
he
come
there
,
that
his
conduct
be
mean
and
unmanly
.
<EOS>
Kate
be
no
coward
.
<EOS>
She
declare
to
herself
that
she
would
do
this
even
though
he
should
threaten
her
with
all
his
fury
,
 
though
he
should
glare
upon
her
with
all
the
horror
of
his
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
one
o'clock
,
and
two
o'clock
,
still
find
her
in
the
dark
sombre
parlour
,
every
now
and
then
pace
the
floor
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
the
fire
have
go
out
,
and
,
though
it
be
now
the
middle
of
April
,
she
begin
to
feel
the
cold
.
<EOS>
but
she
would
not
go
to
bed
before
she
have
write
a
line
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
to
her
brother
a
message
by
telegraph
would
of
course
be
send
the
next
morning
;
as
also
would
she
send
a
message
to
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
but
to
Alice
she
would
write
,
though
it
may
be
but
a
line
.
<EOS>
cold
as
she
be
,
she
find
her
pen
and
paper
,
and
write
her
letter
that
night
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
short
.
"
<EOS>
dear
Alice
,
to

<EOS>
You

I
can
not
write

now
about

even
at
such
a
moment
as

,
that

<EOS>
I

I

<EOS>
I

as
I
have
write
to
her
before
,
see
that
I
want
the
comfort
of
have
her
here
.
<EOS>
Uncle
John
will
of
course
come
or
not
as
he
think
fitting
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
I
be
in
a
position
to
say
that
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
him
;
but
I
should
be
very
glad
.
<EOS>
He
and
you
will
know
that
I
can
,
as
yet
,
tell
you
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
the
lawyer

<EOS>
nothing

I
suppose
,
will
be

till
George

<EOS>
Your
own
cousin
and
friend
,
KATE
VAVASOR

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
then
she
add
a
line
below
,
"
My
own
Alice
,
 
<EOS>
if
you
will
let
me
,
you
shall
be
my
sister

"
  
<EOS>
Alice
,
when
she
receive
this
,
be
at
the
first
moment
so
much
strike
,
and
indeed
surprised
,
by
the
tiding
of
her
grandfather
's
death
,
that
she
be
force
,
in
spite
of
the
still
exist
violence
of
her
own
feeling
,
to
think
and
act
chiefly
with
reference
to
that
event
.
<EOS>
Her
father
have
not
then
leave
his
room
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
go
to
him
,
and
hand
him
Kate
's
letter
.
<EOS>
"
Papa

"
she
say
,
"

,
which
you
hardly
expect
yet
.
"
<EOS>
"
My
father

dead
,
"
say
John
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
Alice
give
him
Kate
's
letter
,
that
he
may
read
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
course
I
shall
go
down
,
"
he
say
,
as
he
come
to
that
part
in
which
Kate
have
speak
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
she
think
I
shall
not
follow
my
father
to
the
grave
,
because
I
dislike
her
brother
?
<EOS>
what
do
she
mean
by
say
that
there
shall
be
no
quarrel
between
you
and
her

"
<EOS>
"
I
will
explain
that
at
another
time
,
"
say
Alice
.
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
ask
no
further
question
then
,
but
declare
at
first
that
he
should
go
to
Westmoreland
on
the
follow
day
.
<EOS>
then
he
alter
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
by
the
mail
train
to
-
night
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
very
disagreeable
,
but
I
ought
to
be
there
when
the
will
be
open
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
very
little
more
say
in
Queen
Anne
Street
on
the
subject
till
the
evening
,
 
till
a
few
moment
before
Mr.
Vavasor
leave
his
house
.
<EOS>
He
indeed
have
think
nothing
more
about
that
quarrelling
,
or
rather
that
promise
that
there
should
be
no
quarrelling
,
between
the
girl
.
<EOS>
He
still
regard
his
nephew
George
as
the
man
who
,
unfortunately
,
be
to
be
his
son
-
in
-
law
,
and
now
,
during
this
tedious
sad
day
,
in
which
he
feel
himself
compel
to
remain
at
home
,
he
busy
his
mind
in
thinking
of
George
and
Alice
,
as
live
together
at
the
old
Hall
.
<EOS>
at
six
,
the

and
daughter

and
soon
after
dinner
Mr.

<EOS>
after

while

she
do
not

so
till
she

that
if
anything

<EOS>
"

say
her
father
,
with
uncontrolled
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
perhaps
say
that
he
have
quarrel
with

.
<EOS>
but
,
dear
papa
,
pray
do
not
question
me
at
present
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell

all
when

It
have

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not

it
to

in
a
hurry
like
this
.
<EOS>
papa
,
you
may
understand
something
of
the
shame
which
I
feel
,
and
you
should
not
question
me
now
.

"
  
"
<EOS>
and
John
Grey
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
different
in
regard
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
shoot
if
I
can
understand
you
.
<EOS>
George
,
you
know
,
have
have
two
thousand
pound
of
your
money
,
 
of
your
or
somebody
else
's
.
<EOS>
well
,
we
can
not
talk
about
it
now
,
as
I
must
be
off
.
<EOS>
think
as
I
do
of
George
,
I
be
glad
of
it
,
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
he
go
,
and
Alice
be
leave
alone
,
to
comfort
herself
as
best
she
may
by
her
own
reflection
.
  
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
have
receive
the
message
on
the
day
previous
to
that
on
which
Alice
's
letter
have
reach
her
,
but
it
have
not
come
to
him
till
late
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
go
down
by
the
mail
train
of
that
night
,
but
there
be
one
or
two
person
,
his
own
attorney
especially
,
whom
he
wish
to
see
before
the
reading
of
his
grandfather
's
will
.
<EOS>
He
remain
in
town
,
therefore
,
on
the
follow
day
,
and
go
down
by
the
same
train
as
that
which
take
his
uncle
.
<EOS>
walk
along
the
platform
,
look
for
a
seat
,
he
peer
into
a
carriage
and
meet
his
uncle
's
eye
.
<EOS>
the
two
see
each
other
,
but
do
not
speak
,
and
George
pass
on
to
another
carriage
.
<EOS>
on
the
following
morning
,
before
the
break
of
day
,
they
meet
again
in
the
refreshment
room
,
at
the
station
at
Lancaster
.
"
<EOS>
so
my
father
have
go
,
George
,
"
say
the
uncle
,
speak
to
the
nephew
.
<EOS>
They
must
go
to
the
same
house
,
and
Mr.
Vavasor
feel
that
it
would
be
well
that
they
should
be
on
speak
term
when
they
reach
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
"
say
George
;
"
he
have
go
at
last
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
we
shall
find
to
have
be
his
late
act
of
injustice
.
<EOS>
"
the
reader
will
remember
that
he
have
receive
Kate
's
first
letter
,
in
which
she
have
tell
him
of
the
Squire
's
altered
will
.
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
turn
away
disgusted
.
<EOS>
His
fine
feeling
be
perhaps
not
very
strong
,
but
he
have
no
thought
or
hope
in
reference
to
the
matter
which
be
mean
.
<EOS>
He
expect
nothing
himself
,
and
do
not
begrudge
his
nephew
the
inheritance
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
he
be
think
of
the
old
Squire
as
a
father
who
have
ever
be
kind
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
natural
that
George
should
have
no
such
old
affection
at
his
heart
,
but
it
be
unnatural
that
he
should
express
himself
as
he
have
do
at
such
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
the
uncle
turn
away
,
but
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
George
follow
him
with
a
little
proposition
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
not
get
any
conveyance
at
Shap
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
have
not
we
better
go
over
in
a
chaise
from
Kendal
?
"
<EOS>
to
this
the
uncle
assent
,
and
so
they
finish
their
journey
together
.
<EOS>
George
smoke
all
the
time
that
they
be
in
the
carriage
,
and
very
few
word
be
speak
.
<EOS>
as
they
drive
up
to
the
old
house
,
they
find
that
another
arrival
have
take
place
before
them
,
 
Mrs.
Greenow
have
reach
the
house
in
some
vehicle
from
the
Shap
station
.
<EOS>
She
have
come
across
from
Norwich
to
Manchester
,
where
she
have
join
the
train
which
have
bring
the
uncle
and
nephew
from
London
.
   
<EOS>
the
Will
.
 
<EOS>
the
coming
of
Mrs.
Greenow
at
this
very
moment
be
a
great
comfort
to
Kate
.
<EOS>
without
her
she
would
hardly
have
know
how
to
bear
herself
with
her
uncle
and
her
brother
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
they
be
all
restrain
by
something
of
the
courtesy
which
stranger
be
bind
to
show
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
George
have
never
see
his
aunt
since
he
be
a
child
,
and
some
sort
of
introduction
be
necessary
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
you
be
George
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
,
put
out
her
hand
and
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes

say
he

<EOS>
"

Mrs.
Greenow

<EOS>
"
It
be
quite
an
honour
to
the
family

so
proud
when
I

<EOS>
She
say
this
pleasantly
,
mean
it
to
be
take
for
truth
,
and
then
turn
away
to
her
brother
.
<EOS>
"
Papa

"
she
say
,
"
though
,
to

so
weak

to
have
be

indeed
?
<EOS>
dear
,
dear
!
<EOS>
He
seem
at
last
to
have
go
off
just
like
poor
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
here
she
put
her
handkerchief
up
to
her
face
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
do
not
know
Greenow
,
John
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
meet
him
once
,
"
say
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
he
be
not
to
be
know
and
understand
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
I
be
aware
there
be
a
little
prejudice
,
because
of
his
being
in
trade
,
but
we
will
not
talk
of
that
now
.
<EOS>
where
should
I
have
be
without
him
,
tradesman
or
no
tradesman
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
he
be
an
excellent
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
say
that
,
John
.
<EOS>
ah
,
well
!
<EOS>
we
can
not
keep
everything
in
this
life
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
,
perhaps
,
be
as
well
to
explain
now
that
Mrs.
Greenow
have
tell
Captain
Bellfield
at
their
last
meeting
before
she
leave
Norwich
,
that
,
under
certain
circumstance
,
if
he
behave
himself
well
,
there
may
possibly
be
grind
of
hope
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
Captain
Bellfield
have
immediately
go
to
the
good
tailor
in
that
city
,
have
tell
the
man
of
his
come
marriage
,
and
have
give
an
extensive
order
.
<EOS>
but
the
tailor
have
not
as
yet
supply
the
good
,
wait
for
more
credible
evidence
of
the
Captain
's
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
all
grass
of
the
field
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
,
lightly
brush
a
tear
from
her
eye
,
"
and
must
be
cut
down
and
put
into
the
oven
in
our
turn
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
brother
utter
a
slight
sympathetic
groan
,
shake
his
head
in
testimony
of
the
uncertainty
of
human
affair
,
and
then
say
that
he
would
go
out
and
look
about
the
place
.
<EOS>
George
,
in
the
meantime
,
have
ask
his
sister
to
show
him
his
room
,
and
the
two
be
already
together
up
-
stair
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
have
make
up
her
mind
that
she
would
say
nothing
about
Alice
at
the
present
moment
,
 
nothing
,
if
it
could
be
avoid
,
till
after
the
funeral
.
<EOS>
She
lead
the
way
up
-
stair
,
almost
tremble
with
fear
,
for
she
know
that
that
other
subject
of
the
will
would
also
give
rise
to
trouble
and
sorrow
,
 
perhaps
,
also
,
to
determine
quarrelling
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
have
bring
that
woman
here
?
<EOS>
"
be
the
first
question
that
George
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
her
to
come
,
"
say
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
do
you
ask
her
to
come
here
?
"
say
George
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
Kate
immediately
feel
that
he
be
speak
as
though
he
be
master
of
the
house
,
and
also
as
though
he
intend
to
be
master
of
her
.
<EOS>
as
regard
the
former
idea
,
she
have
no
objection
to
it
.
<EOS>
She
thoroughly
and
honestly
wish
that
he
may
be
the
master
;
and
though
she
fear
that
he
may
find
himself
mistaken
in
his
assumption
,
she
herself
be
not
dispose
to
deny
any
appearance
of
right
that
he
may
take
upon
himself
in
that
respect
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
already
begin
to
tell
herself
that
she
must
not
submit
herself
to
his
masterdom
.
<EOS>
She
have
gradually
so
teach
herself
since
he
have
compel
her
to
write
the
first
letter
in
which
Alice
have
be
ask
to
give
her
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
her
,
George
,
before
my
poor
grandfather
's
death
,
when
I
think
that
he
would
linger
perhaps
for
week
.
<EOS>
My
life
here
alone
with
him
,
without
any
other
woman
in
the
house
beside
the
servant
,
be
very
melancholy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
not
ask
Alice
to
come
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
could
not
have
come
,
"
say
Kate
,
after
a
short
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
why
she
should
not
have
come
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
have
that
woman
about
the
place
.
<EOS>
She
disgrace
herself
by
marry
a
blacksmith
 
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
George
,
it
be
you
yourself
who
advise
me
to
go
and
stay
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
very
different
thing
.
<EOS>
now
that
he
be
dead
,
and
she
be
get
his
money
,
it
be
all
very
well
that
you
should
go
to
her
occasionally
;
but
I
will
not
have
her
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
natural
that
she
should
come
to
her
father
's
house
at
her
father
's
death
-
bed
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
to
be
tell
that
thing
be
natural

It
always
mean
humbug

I
do
not
suppose
she
care
for
the
old
man
any
more
than
I
do

than
she
care
for
the
other
old
man
who
marry
her

<EOS>
People
be
such
intense
hypocrite
.
<EOS>
there
be
my
uncle
John
,
pull
a
long
face
because
he
have
come
into
this
house
,

he
will
pull
it
as
long

up
there

yet
for
the
last
twenty
year
there
be
nothing
on

so
much
hate

on

separate

there
have
come
upon
him
of
late
a
hard
ferocity

make
him
unendurable

carry
to
such
a
pitch
that
hatred

it

of
conventional

he
allow

control

Hall

the
morning
of

funeral

understand

her
nephew

bad
humour

call
him

poor
George

treat
all
his
incivility
to
herself
as
though
it
be
the
effect
of
his
grief

ask
him
question
about
Parliament
,
which
,
of
course
,
he
do
not
answer
,
and
tell
him
little
story
about
poor
dear
Greenow
,
not
heed
his
expression
of
unmistakable
disgust

<EOS>
the
two
day
at
last
go
by
,
and
the
hour
of
the
funeral
come
.

there
be
the
doctor
and
Gogram
,
and
the
uncle
and
the
nephew
,
to
follow
the
corpse
,
 
the
nephew
take
upon
himself
ostentatiously
<EOS>
the
foremost
place
,
as
though
he
could
thereby
help
to
maintain
his
pretension
as
heir
.
<EOS>
the
clergyman
meet
them
at
the
little
wicket
-
gate
of
the
churchyard
,
have
,
by
some
reasoning
,
which
we
hope
be
satisfactory
to
himself
,
overcome
a
resolution
which
he
at
first
form
,
that
he
would
not
read
the
burial
service
over
an
unrepentant
sinner
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
read
it
,
have
mention
his
scruple
to
none
but
one
confidential
clerical
friend
in
the
same
diocese

"
I
be
tell
that
you
have
get
my

him

"
I
have
it
in
my
pocket
,
"

Mr.
Gogram
,
"
and
purpose
to
read
it
as
soon
as
we
return
from
church

"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
usual
to
take
a
will
away
from
a
man
's
house
in
that
way
?
"
<EOS>
George
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
quite
usual
,
"

the
attorney
;
"
and
in
this
case
it
be
do
at
the
express
desire
of
the
testator
.

I
think
it
be
the
common
practice

John
Vavasor

<EOS>
George
upon
this
turn
round
at
his
uncle
as
though
about
to
attack
him
,
but
he
restrain
himself
and
say
nothing
,
though
he
show
his
tooth
.
  
<EOS>
the
funeral
be
very
plain
,
and
not
a
word
be
speak
by
George
Vavasor
during
the
journey
there
and
back
.
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
ask
a
few
question
of
the
doctor
as
to
the
last
week
of
his
father
's
life
;
and
it
be
incidentally
mention
,
both
by
the
doctor
and
by
the
attorney
,
that
the
old
Squire
's
intellect
have
remain
unimpaired
up
to
the
last
moment
that
he
have
be
see
by
either
of
them
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
Mr.

as

have
pull
a
document
out

"
Gentlemen

will
you

Mr.

<EOS>
John
Vavasor

sit
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
prefer
to
stand
here
,
"
say
George
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gogram
then
open
the
document
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
before
that
paper
be
read
,
"
say
George
,
"
I
think
it
right
to
say
a
few
word
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
it
contain
,
but
I
believe
it
to
have
be
execute
by
my
grandfather
only
an
hour
or
two
before
his
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
on
the
day
before
he
die
,
 
early
in
the
day
,
"
say
the
attorney
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
 
the
day
before
he
die
;
it
be
the
same
thing
,
 
while
he
be
die
,
in
fact
.
<EOS>
He
never
get
out
of
bed
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
not
in
bed
at
the
time
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
not
that
it
would
have
matter
if
he
have
be
.
<EOS>
and
he
come
down
to
dinner
on
that
day
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
,
however
,
why
you
make
these
observation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
listen
to
me
you
will
understand
.
<EOS>
I
make
them
because
I
deny
my
grandfather
's
fitness
to
make
a
will
in
the
last
moment
of
his
existence
,
and
at
such
an
age
.
<EOS>
I
see
him
a
few
week
ago
,
and
he
be
not
fit
to
be
trust
with
the
management
of
property
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
this
be
the
time
,
George
,
to
put
forward
such
objection
,
"
say
the
uncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
,
"
say
George
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
that
that
paper
purport
to
be
an
instrument
by
which
I
should
be
villanously
defraud
if
it
be
allow
to
be
hold
as
good
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
protest
against
it
now
,
and
shall
question
it
at
law
if
action
be
take
on
it
.
<EOS>
You
can
read
it
now
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
I
shall
read
,
"
say
Mr.
Gogram
;
"
and
I
say
that
it
be
as
valid
a
will
as
ever
a
man
sign
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
say
it
be
not
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
difference
between
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
will
be
read
amidst
sundry
interjection
and
expression
of
anger
from
George
,
which
it
be
not
necessary
to
repeat
.
<EOS>
nor
need
I
trouble
my
reader
with
the
will
at
length
.
<EOS>
It
begin
by
express
the
testator
's
great
desire
that
his
property
may
descend
in
his
own
family
,
and
that
the
house
may
be
hold
and
inhabit
by
some
one
bear
the
name
of
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
He
then
declare
that
he
feel
himself
oblige
to
pass
over
his
natural
heir
,
believe
that
the
property
would
not
be
safe
in
his
hand
;
he
therefore
leave
it
in
trust
to
his
son
John
Vavasor
,
whom
he
appoint
to
be
sole
executor
of
his
will
.
<EOS>
He
devise
it
to
George
's
eld
son
,
 
should
George
ever
marry
and
have
a
son
,
 
as
soon
as
he
may
reach
the
age
of
twenty
-
five
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
the
property
should
remain
in
the
hand
of
John
Vavasor
for
his
use
and
benefit
,
with
a
lien
on
it
of
five
hundred
a
year
to
be
pay
annually
to
his
granddaughter
Kate
.
<EOS>
in
the
event
of
George
have
no
son
,
the
property
be
to
go
to
the
eld
son
of
Kate
,
or
fail
that
to
the
eld
son
of
his
other
granddaughter
who
may
take
the
name
of
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
all
his
personal
property
he
leave
to
his
son
,
John
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
"
say
the
attorney
,
as
he
finish
his
reading
,
"
you
will
,
I
fear
,
get
very
little
by
that
latter
clause
.
<EOS>
the
estate
now
owe
nothing
;
but
I
doubt
whether
the
Squire
have
fifty
pound
in
his
banker
's
hand
when
he
die
,
and
the
value
of
the
property
about
the
place
be
very
small
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
unwilling
to
spend
anything
during
the
last
ten
year
,
but
have
pay
off
every
shilling
that
the
property
owe
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
as
I
suppose
,
"
say
George
.
<EOS>
His
voice
be
very
unpleasant
,
and
so
be
the
fire
of
his
eye
and
the
ghastly
rage
of
his
scar
face
.
<EOS>
"
the
old
man
have
endeavour
in
his
anger
to
rob
me
of
everything
because
I
would
not
obey
him
in
his
wickedness
when
I
be
here
with
him
a
short
while
before
he
die
.
<EOS>
such
a
will
as
that
can
stand
nowhere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
to
that
I
have
nothing
to
say
at
present
,
"
say
the
attorney
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
his
other
will
,
 
the
one
he
make
before
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
remember
rightly
we
execute
two
before
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
where
be
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
my
business
to
know
,
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
I
see
him
destroy
one
,
but
I
have
no
absolute
knowledge
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
other
,
I
can
say
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
do
you
mean
to
do
?
"
say
George
,
turn
to
his
uncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
!
<EOS>
I
shall
carry
out
the
will
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
Your
sister
be
the
person
chiefly
interested
under
it
.
<EOS>
She
get
five
hundred
a
year
for
her
life
;
and
if
she
marry
and
you
do
not
,
or
if
she
have
a
son
and
you
do
not
,
her
son
will
have
the
whole
property
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
George
stand
for
a
few
moment
think
.
<EOS>
may
it
not
be
possible
that
by
mean
of
Alice
and
Kate
together
,
 
by
marry
the
former
,
 
perhaps
,
he
may
still
obtain
possession
of
the
property
?
<EOS>
but
that
which
he
want
be
the
command
of
the
property
at
once
,
 
the
power
of
raise
money
upon
it
instantly
.
<EOS>
the
will
have
be
so
framed
as
to
make
that
impossible
in
any
way
.
<EOS>
Kate
's
share
in
it
have
not
be
leave
to
her
unconditionally
,
but
be
to
be
receive
even
by
her
through
the
hand
of
her
uncle
John
.
<EOS>
such
a
will
shut
him
out
from
all
his
hope
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
piece
of
d
 
---
roguery
,
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
by
that
,
sir
?
"
say
Gogram
,
turn
round
towards
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
exactly
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
piece
of
d

roguery

<EOS>
who
be
in
the
room
when
that
thing
be
write
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
signature
be
witness
by
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
do
not
ask
as
to
the
signature

<EOS>
who
be
in
the
room

the
thing
be
write
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
here
with
your
grandfather

"
<EOS>
and
no
one
else
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
no
one
else
.
<EOS>
the
presence
of
any
one
else
at
such
a
time
would
be
very
unusual
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
regard
the
document
simply
as
waste
paper
.
"
<EOS>
after
say
this
,
George
Vavasor
leave
the
room
,
and
slam
the
door
after
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
be
insult
in
such
a
way
before
,
"
say
the
attorney
,
almost
with
tear
in
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
disappointed
and
I
fear
a
ruin
man
,
"
say
John
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
you
need
regard
what
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
he
should
not
on
that
account
insult
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
do
my
duty
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
even
advise
his
grandfather
.
<EOS>
It
be
mean
on
his
part
and
unmanly
.
<EOS>
if
he
come
in
my
way
again
I
shall
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
probably
will
not
put
himself
in
your
way
again
,
Mr.
Gogram
.
"
  
<EOS>
then
the
attorney
go
,
have
suggest
to
Mr.
Vavasor
that
he
should
instruct
his
attorney
in
London
to
take
step
in
reference
to
the
proving
of
the
will
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
as
good
a
will
as
ever
be
make
,
"
say
Mr.
Gogram
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
can
set
that
aside
,
I
will
give
up
make
will
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
who
be
to
tell
Kate
?
<EOS>
that
be
John
Vavasor
's
first
thought
when
he
be
leave
alone
at
the
hall
-
door
,
after
see
the
lawyer
start
away
.
<EOS>
and
how
be
he
to
get
himself
back
to
London
without
further
quarrel
with
his
nephew
?
<EOS>
and
what
be
he
to
do
at
once
with
reference
to
the
immediate
duty
of
proprietorship
which
be
entail
upon
him
as
executor
?
<EOS>
It
be
by
no
means
improbable
,
as
he
think
,
that
George
may
assume
to
himself
the
position
of
master
of
the
house
;
that
he
may
demand
the
key
,
for
instance
,
which
no
doubt
be
in
Kate
's
hand
at
present
,
and
that
he
would
take
possession
with
violence
.
<EOS>
what
should
he
do
under
such
circumstance
?
<EOS>
It
be
clear
that
he
could
not
run
away
and
get
back
to
his
club
by
the
night
mail
train
.
<EOS>
He
have
duty
there
at
the
Hall
,
and
these
duty
be
of
a
nature
to
make
him
almost
regret
the
position
in
which
his
father
's
will
have
place
him
.
<EOS>
eventually
he
would
gain
some
considerable
increase
to
his
mean
,
but
the
immediate
effect
would
be
terribly
troublesome
.
<EOS>
as
he
look
up
at
the
melancholy
pine
which
be
slowly
wave
their
head
in
the
wind
before
the
door
he
declare
to
himself
that
he
would
sell
his
inheritance
and
his
executorship
very
cheaply
,
if
such
a
sale
be
possible
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
dining
-
room
he
find
his
sister
alone
.
"
<EOS>
well
,
John
,
"
say
she
;
"
<EOS>
well
?
<EOS>
how
be
it
leave
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
Kate
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
go
out
with
her
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
he
take
his
hat
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
.
<EOS>
He
ask
her
to
walk
,
and
she
go
with
him
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
I
suppose
,
he
will
tell
her
,
"
say
John
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
after
that
he
explain
the
circumstance
of
the
will
to
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
Bravo
,
"
exclaim
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
delighted
.
<EOS>
I
love
Kate
dearly
:
and
now
she
can
marry
almost
whom
she
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
another
walk
on
the
Fells
.
 
<EOS>
George
when
he
leave
the
room
in
which
he
have
insult
the
lawyer
,
go
immediately
across
to
the
parlour
in
which
his
aunt
and
sister
be
sit
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Kate
,
"
say
he
,
"
put
on
your
hat
and
come
and
walk
with
me

<EOS>
that
business
be
over
.
"
<EOS>
Kate
's
hat
and
shawl
be
in
the
room
,
and
they
be
out
of
the
house
together
within
a
minute
.
  
<EOS>
They
walk
down
the
carriage
-
road
,
through
the
desolate
,
untenanted
ground
,
to
the
gate
,
before
either
of
them
speak
a
word
.
<EOS>
Kate
be
wait
for
George
to
tell
her
of
the
will
,
but
do
not
dare
to
ask
any
question
.
<EOS>
George
intend
to
tell
her
of
the
will
,
but
be
not
disposed
to
do
so
without
some
preparation
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
thing
not
to
be
speak
of
open
-
mouthed
,
as
a
piece
of
ordinary
news
.
<EOS>
"
which
way
shall
we
go
?
"
say
Kate
,
as
soon
as
they
have
pass
through
the
old
rickety
gate
,
which
swing
at
the
entrance
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
up
across
the
fell
,
"
say
George
;
"
the
day
be
fine
,
and
I
want
to
get
away
from
my
uncle
for
a
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
turn
round
,
therefore
,
outside
the
hill
of
firs
,
and
lead
the
way
back
to
the
beacon
wood
through
which
she
and
Alice
have
walk
across
to
haweswater
upon
a
memorable
occasion
.
<EOS>
They
have
reach
the
top
of
the
beacon
hill
,
and
be
out
upon
the
Fell
,
before
George
have
begin
his
story
.
<EOS>
Kate
be
half
beside
herself
with
curiosity
,
but
still
she
be
afraid
to
ask
.
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
George
,
when
they
pause
a
moment
as
they
step
over
a
plank
that
cross
the
boundary
ditch
of
the
wood
:
"
do
not
you
want
to
know
what
that
dear
old
man
have
do
for
you
?
"
<EOS>
then
he
look
into
her
face
very
steadfastly
.
"
<EOS>
but
perhaps
you
know
already
,
"
he
add
.
<EOS>
He
have
come
out
determined
not
to
quarrel
with
his
sister
.
<EOS>
He
have
resolve
,
in
that
moment
of
thought
which
have
be
allow
to
him
,
that
his
good
hope
for
the
present
require
that
he
should
keep
himself
on
good
term
with
her
,
at
any
rate
till
he
have
settle
what
line
of
conduct
he
would
pursue
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
,
in
truth
,
so
sore
with
anger
and
disappointment
,
 
he
have
become
so
nearly
mad
with
that
continued
,
unappeased
wrath
in
which
he
now
indulge
against
all
the
world
,
that
he
could
not
refrain
himself
from
bitter
word
.
<EOS>
He
be
as
one
drive
by
the
Furies
,
and
be
no
longer
able
to
control
them
in
their
driving
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
of
it
,
"
say
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
I
know
I
should
have
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Your
question
be
unjust
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
begin
to
doubt
,
"
say
he
,
"
whether
a
man
can
be
safe
in
trust
any
one
.
<EOS>
My
grandfather
have
do
his
good
to
rob
me
of
the
property
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
that
I
fear
he
would
do
so
.

"
and
he
have
make
you
his
heir
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
you
.
"
  
<EOS>

He
tell
me
distinctly
that
he
would
not
do
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
he
have
,
I
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
George
,
I
shall
do
that
which
I
tell
him
I
should
do
in
the
event
of
his
make
such
a
will
;
for
he
ask
me
the
question
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
should
restore
the
estate
to
you
,
and
upon
that
he
swear
that
he
would
not
leave
it
to
me
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
what
a
fool
you
be
,
"
say
he
,
stop
her
in
the
pathway
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
an
ass
!
<EOS>
why
do
you
tell
him
that
?
<EOS>
You
know
that
he
would
not
,
on
that
account
,
do
justice
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
ask
me
,
George
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Psha
!
<EOS>
now
you
have
ruin
me
,
and
you
may
have
save
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
will
save
you
still
,
if
he
have
leave
the
estate
to
me

<EOS>
I
do
not
desire
to
take
it
from
you

<EOS>
as
God
in
heaven
see
me
,
I
have
never
cease
to
endeavour
to
protect
your
interest
here
at
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
I
will
sign
anything
necessary
to
make
over
my
right
in
the
property
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
then
they
walk
on
over
the
Fell
for
some
minute
without
speak
.
<EOS>
They
be
still
on
the
same
path
,
 
that
path
which
Kate
and
Alice
have
take
in
the
winter
,
 
and
<EOS>
now
poor
Kate
could
not
but
think
of
all
that
she
have
say
that
day
on
George
's
behalf
;
 
how
have
she
mingle
truth
and
falsehood
in
her
effort
to
raise
her
brother
's
character
in
her
cousin
's
eye
!
<EOS>
It
have
all
be
do
in
vain
.
<EOS>
at
this
very
moment
of
her
own
trouble
Kate
think
of
John
Grey
,
and
repent
of
what
she
have
do
.
<EOS>
Her
hope
in
that
direction
be
altogether
blast
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
her
brother
have
ill
-
treat
Alice
,
and
that
she
must
tell
him
so
if
Alice
's
name
be
mention
between
them
.
<EOS>
She
could
no
longer
worship
her
brother
,
and
hold
herself
at
his
command
in
all
thing
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
regard
the
property
to
which
he
be
naturally
the
heir
,
if
any
act
of
her
could
give
it
to
him
,
that
act
would
be
do
.
<EOS>
"
if
the
will
be
as
you
say
,
George
,
I
will
make
over
my
right
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
make
over
nothing
,
"
he
answer
.
<EOS>
"
the
old
robber
have
be
too
cunning
for
that
;
he

leave
it
all
in
the
hand
of

John

George

dead

of

he
be
dead

<EOS>
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
I
wish
he
have
be
dead
ten
year
ago
,
 
or
twenty
.
<EOS>
do
you
suppose
I
be
to
forgive
him
because
he
be
dead

<EOS>
I
will
heap
his
grave
with
curse
,
if
that
can
be
of
avail
to
punish
him

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
only
punish

way

I
will
punish
them

not
by

<EOS>
My
uncle
John
shall
have
such
a
life
of
it
for
the
next
year
or
two
that
he
shall
bitterly
regret
the
hour
in
which
he

step
between
me

not

down
here
for
at
Christmas

I

up

You

the
matter
rest

I
can
tell
you
.

You
will
have
to
prove
that

how
long
be
it

estate

Kate
think
for
a
moment
before

answer

"
It
be
only
two
day
before

rightly

you
must
remember
rightly

You

now
tell
me
this
honestly

condition
fit

"
why

what
reason
do
you
give

I
tell
him

He

me
a

this

I
do
not

that

nothing

she

,
stop

George

you

He
smile
,
 
with
a
slight
provoking
smile
that
pass
very
rapidly
from
his
face

the
meaning
of

to
be
read

calm
enough
to
read
it

the
meaning

well

never

about
that

he

him

weak

look
here

They
be
now
upon

side

than
three
mile
away

look
round

see

so

be
aware

itself
upon

being
of
importance

she
think
again

her
resolution

fight
with

in
so
many
word

would
not

him

his

face
be
ever

terrible

surely
her

do
her
no

though
he
should
do
so

though

should
take
her
roughly
by
the
arm

he
have
do
to
Alice

should
do
bad

she
would
fight
him

the
violence

<EOS>
then
he
push
her
from
him
with
great
violence
,
so
that
she
fall
heavily
upon
the
stony
ground
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
stop
to
help
her
up
,
or
even
to
look
at
her
as
she
lie
,
but
walk
away
across
the
heath
,
neither
take
the
track
on
towards
Haweswater
,
nor
return
by
the
path
which
have
bring
them
thither
.
<EOS>
He
go
away
northward
across
the
wild
fall
;
and
Kate
,
have
rise
up
and
seat
herself
on
a
small
cairn
of
stone
which
stand
there
,
watch
him
as
he
descend
the
slope
of
the
hill
till
he
be
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
run
,
but
he
seem
to
move
rapidly
,
and
he
never
once
turn
round
to
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
He
go
away
,
down
the
hill
northward
,
and
presently
the
curving
of
the
ground
hide
him
from
her
view
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
first
seat
herself
her
thought
have
be
altogether
of
him
.
<EOS>
She
have
fear
no
personal
injury
,
even
when
she
have
ask
him
whether
he
would
murder
her
.
<EOS>
Her
blood
have
be
hot
within
her
vein
,
and
her
heart
have
be
full
of
defiance
.
<EOS>
even
yet
she
fear
nothing
,
but
continue
to
think
of
him
and
his
misery
,
and
his
disgrace
.
<EOS>
that
he
be
go
for
ever
,
utterly
and
irretrievably
ruin
,
throw
out
,
as
it
be
,
beyond
the
pale
of
man
,
be
now
certain
to
her
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
the
brother
in
whom
she
have
believe
;
for
whom
she
have
not
only
be
willing
to
sacrifice
herself
,
but
for
whose
purpose
she
have
strive
to
sacrifice
her
cousin
!
<EOS>
what
would
he
do
now
?
<EOS>
as
he
pass
from
out
of
her
sight
down
the
hill
,
it
seem
to
her
as
though
he
be
rush
straight
into
some
hell
from
which
there
could
be
no
escape
.
  
<EOS>
She
know
that
her
arm
have
be
hurt
in
the
fall
,
but
for
a
while
she
would
not
move
it
or
feel
it
,
be
resolve
to
take
no
account
of
what
may
have
happen
to
herself
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
have
be
go
some
ten
minute
,
she
rise
to
her
foot
,
and
find
that
the
movement
pain
her
greatly
,
and
that
her
right
arm
be
powerless
,
she
put
up
her
left
hand
and
become
aware
that
the
bone
of
her
arm
be
break
below
the
elbow
.
<EOS>
Her
first
thought
be
give
to
the
tell
him
of
this
,
or
the
not
tell
,
when
she
should
meet
him
below
at
the
house
.
<EOS>
how
should
she
mention
the
accident
to
him
?
<EOS>
Should
she
lie
,
and
say
that
she
have
fall
as
she
come
down
the
hill
alone
?
<EOS>
of
course
he
would
not
believe
her
,
but
still
some
such
excuse
as
that
may
make
the
matter
easy
for
them
all
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
occur
to
her
that
she
may
not
see
him
again
at
all
that
day
;
and
that
,
as
far
as
he
be
concern
,
there
may
be
need
for
no
lie
.
  
<EOS>
She
start
off
to
walk
down
home
,
hold
her
right
arm
steadily
against
her
body
with
her
left
hand
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
must
give
some
account
of
herself
when
she
get
to
the
house
;
but
it
be
of
the
account
to
be
give
to
him
that
she
think
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
other
she
care
little
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
here
I
be
;
my
arm
be
break
;
and
you
have
better
send
for
a
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
that
would
be
sufficient
for
them
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
get
into
the
wood
the
path
be
very
dark
.
<EOS>
the
heaven
be
overcast
with
cloud
,
and
a
few
drop
begin
to
fall
.
<EOS>
then
the
rain
fall
faster
and
faster
,
and
before
she
have
go
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
the
beacon
hill
,
the
cloud
have
open
themselves
,
and
the
shower
have
become
a
storm
of
water
.
<EOS>
suffer
as
she
be
<EOS>
she
stand
up
for
a
few
moment
under
a
large
tree
,
take
the
excuse
of
the
rain
for
some
minute
of
delay
,
that
she
may
make
up
her
mind
as
to
what
she
would
say
.
<EOS>
then
it
occur
to
her
that
she
may
possibly
meet
him
again
before
she
reach
the
house
;
and
,
as
she
think
of
it
,
she
begin
for
the
first
time
to
fear
him
.
<EOS>
Would
he
come
out
upon
her
from
the
tree
and
really
kill
her
?
<EOS>
have
he
make
his
way
round
,
when
he
get
out
of
her
sight
,
that
he
may
fall
upon
her
suddenly
and
do
as
he
have
threaten
?
<EOS>
as
the
idea
come
upon
her
,
she
make
a
little
attempt
to
run
,
but
she
find
that
run
be
impracticable
from
the
pain
the
movement
cause
her
.
<EOS>
then
she
walk
on
through
the
hard
rain
,
steadily
hold
her
arm
against
her
side
,
but
still
look
every
moment
through
the
tree
on
the
side
from
which
George
may
be
expect
to
reach
her
.
<EOS>
but
no
one
come
near
her
on
her
way
homeward
.
<EOS>
have
she
be
calm
enough
to
think
of
the
nature
of
the
ground
,
she
may
have
know
that
he
could
not
have
return
upon
her
so
quickly
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
come
back
up
the
steep
hill
-
side
which
she
have
see
him
descend
.
<EOS>
no
;
 
he
have
go
away
altogether
,
across
the
fell
towards
Bampton
,
and
be
at
this
moment
vainly
button
his
coat
across
his
breast
,
in
his
unconscious
attempt
to
keep
out
the
wet
.
<EOS>
the
Fury
be
drive
him
on
,
and
he
himself
be
not
aware
whither
he
be
drive
.
  
<EOS>

without

It

when

o'clock

the
night
of

knock
at

<EOS>
there

<EOS>
Her

<EOS>
do
not
trouble
her
with
question
till
she
have
have
some
hour
"
sleep
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
"
then
the
doctor
go
,
and
John
Vavasor
be
leave
alone
,
stand
with
his
back
to
the
dining
-
room
fire
.
  
<EOS>
there
have
be
so
much
trouble
and
confusion
in
the
house
since
Kate
have
faint
,
almost
immediately
upon
her
reach
home
,
that
Mr.
Vavasor
have
not
yet
have
time
to
make
up
his
mind
as
to
the
nature
of
the
accident
which
have
occur
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
have
at
once
ascertain
that
the
bone
be
break
,
and
the
doctor
have
be
send
for
.
<EOS>
luckily
he
have
be
find
at
home
,
and
have
reach
the
Hall
a
little
before
ten
o'clock
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
as
soon
as
Kate
recover
her
sense
,
she
volunteer
her
account
of
what
have
occur
.
  
<EOS>
Her
brother
have
quarrel
with
her
about
the
will
,
she
say
,
and
have
leave
her
abruptly
on
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
She
have
fall
,
she
go
on
to
say
,
as
she
turn
from
him
,
and
have
at
once
find
that
she
have
hurt
herself
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
be
too
angry
with
him
to
let
him
know
it
;
and
,
indeed
,
she
have
not
know
the
extent
herself
till
he
have
pass
out
of
her
sight
.
<EOS>
this
be
her
story
;
and
there
be
nothing
in
it
that
be
false
by
the
letter
,
though
there
be
much
that
be
false
in
the
spirit
.
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
true
that
George
have
not
know
that
she
be
injure
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
she
have
ask
him
for
no
help
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
in
one
sense
,
that
she
have
fall
,
and
it
be
true
that
she
have
not
herself
know
how
severe
have
be
the
injury
do
to
her
till
he
have
go
beyond
the
reach
of
her
voice
.
<EOS>
but
she
repress
all
mention
of
his
violence
,
and
when
she
be
press
as
to
the
nature
of
the
quarrel
,
she
decline
to
speak
further
on
that
matter
.
  
<EOS>
neither
her
uncle
nor
her
aunt
believe
her
.
<EOS>
that
be
a
matter
of
course
,
and
she
know
that
they
do
not
believe
her
.
<EOS>
George
's
absence
,
their
recent
experience
of
his
mood
,
and
the
violence
by
which
her
arm
must
have
be
break
,
make
them
certain
that
Kate
have
more
to
tell
if
she
choose
to
tell
it
.
<EOS>
but
in
her
present
condition
they
could
not
question
her
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
do
ask
as
to
the
probability
of
her
nephew
's
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
tell
you
,
"
say
Kate
,
"
that
he
go
away
across
the
Fell
in
the
direction
of
Bampton
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
have
go
on
to
Penrith
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
angry
with
us
all
;
and
as
the
house
be
not
his
own
,
he
have
probably
resolve
that
he
will
not
stay
another
night
under
the
roof
.
<EOS>
but
,
who
can
say
?
<EOS>
He
be
not
in
his
sense
when
he
be
anger
.
"
  
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
,
as
he
stand
alone
after
the
doctor
's
departure
,
endeavour
to
ascertain
the
truth
by
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
"
he
say
to
himself
,
"
that
the
doctor
suspect
that
there
have
be
violence
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
from
his
tone
,
and
I
can
see
it
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
but
how
to
prove
it
?
<EOS>
and
would
there
be
good
in
prove
it
?
<EOS>
poor
girl
!
<EOS>
Will
it
not
be
well
for
her
to
let
it
pass
as
though
we
believe
her
story
?
"
<EOS>
He
make
up
his
mind
that
it
would
be
well
.
<EOS>
why
should
he
take
upon
himself
the
terrible
task
of
call
this
insane
relation
to
account
for
an
act
which
he
could
not
prove
?
<EOS>
the
will
itself
,
without
that
trouble
,
would
give
him
trouble
enough
.
<EOS>
then
he
begin
to
long
that
he
be
back
at
his
club
,
and
to
think
that
the
signing
-
room
in
Chancery
Lane
be
not
so
bad
.
<EOS>
and
so
he
go
up
to
his
bed
,
call
at
Kate
's
door
to
ask
after
the
patient
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
there
have
come
a
messenger
to
Mrs.
Greenow
,
who
have
station
herself
with
her
niece
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
girl
of
the
house
bring
up
a
scrap
of
paper
to
the
door
,
say
that
a
boy
have
bring
it
over
with
a
cart
from
Shap
,
and
that
it
be
intend
for
Miss
Vavasor
,
and
it
be
she
who
knock
at
the
sickroom
door
.
<EOS>
the
note
be
open
and
be
not
address
;
indeed
,
the
word
be
write
on
a
scrap
of
paper
that
be
crumple
up
rather
than
fold
,
and
be
as
follow
:
<EOS>
"
send
me
my
clothe
by
the
bearer
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
return
to
the
house
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
take
it
in
to
Kate
,
and
then
go
away
to
see
her
nephew
's
thing
duly
put
into
his
portmanteau
.
<EOS>
this
be
send
away
in
the
cart
,
and
Mr.
Vavasor
,
as
he
go
up
-
stair
,
be
tell
what
have
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
neither
on
that
night
or
on
the
follow
day
do
Mrs.
Greenow
ask
any
further
question
;
but
on
the
morning
after
that
,
when
the
doctor
have
leave
them
with
a
good
account
of
the
broken
limb
,
her
curiosity
would
brook
no
further
delay
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
indignation
as
well
as
curiosity
urge
her
on
.
<EOS>
in
disposition
she
be
less
easy
,
and
,
perhaps
,
less
selfish
,
than
her
brother
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
the
case
that
that
man
have
ill
-
treat
his
sister
,
she
would
have
sacrifice
much
to
bring
him
to
punishment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Kate
,
"
she
say
,
when
the
doctor
be
go
,
"
I
expect
that
you
will
tell
me
the
whole
truth
as
to
what
occur
between
you
and
your
brother
when
you
have
this
accident
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
tell
you
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
not
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
all
the
truth
I
mean
to
tell
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
He
have
quarrel
with
me
,
as
I
think
,
most
unnecessarily
,
but
you
do
not
suppose
that
I
be
go
to
give
an
exact
account
of
the
quarrel
?
<EOS>
We
be
both
wrong
,
probably
,
and
so
let
there
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
he
violent
to
you
when
he
quarrel
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
when
he
be
angry
he
be
always
violent
in
his
language
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
do
he
strike
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
dear
aunt
,
do
not
be
angry
with
me
if
I
say
that
I
will
not
be
cros
-
examined
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
answer
no
more
question
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
questioning
can
do
no
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
know
her
niece
well
enough
to
be
aware
that
nothing
more
would
be
tell
her
,
but
she
be
quite
sure
now
that
Kate
have
not
break
her
arm
by
a
simple
fall
.
<EOS>
She
be
certain
that
the
injury
have
come
from
positive
violence
.
<EOS>
have
it
not
be
so
,
Kate
would
not
have
content
herself
with
refuse
to
answer
the
last
question
that
have
be
ask
,
but
would
also
have
repel
the
charge
make
against
her
brother
with
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
it
your
own
way
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
;
"
but
let
me
just
tell
you
this
,
that
your
brother
George
have
better
keep
out
of
my
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
probable
that
he
will
,
"
say
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
especially
if
you
remain
here
to
nurse
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Kate
's
conduct
in
answer
all
the
question
make
to
her
be
not
difficult
,
but
she
find
that
there
be
much
difficulty
in
plan
her
own
future
behaviour
towards
her
own
brother
.
<EOS>
Must
she
abandon
him
altogether
from
henceforth
;
divide
herself
from
him
,
as
it
be
;
have
perfectly
separate
interest
,
and
interest
that
be
indeed
hostile
?
<EOS>
and
must
she
see
him
ruin
and
overwhelm
by
want
of
money
,
while
she
have
be
make
a
rich
woman
by
her
grandfather
's
will
?
<EOS>
It
will
be
remember
that
her
life
have
hitherto
be
devoted
to
him
;
that
all
her
scheme
and
plan
have
have
his
success
as
their
object
;
that
she
have
teach
herself
to
consider
it
to
be
her
duty
to
sacrifice
everything
to
his
welfare
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
sad
to
abandon
the
only
object
of
a
life
!
<EOS>
It
be
very
hard
to
tear
out
from
one
's
heart
and
fling
away
from
it
the
only
love
that
one
have
cherish
!
<EOS>
what
be
she
to
say
to
Alice
about
all
this
 
to
Alice
whom
she
have
cheat
of
a
husband
worthy
of
her
,
that
she
may
allure
her
into
the
arm
of
one
so
utterly
unworthy
?
<EOS>
luckily
for
Kate
,
her
accident
be
of
such
a
nature
that
any
writing
to
Alice
be
now
out
of
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
but
a
blow
!
<EOS>
what
woman
can
bear
a
blow
from
a
man
,
and
afterwards
return
to
him
with
love
?
<EOS>
a
wife
may
have
to
bear
it
and
to
return
.
<EOS>
and
she
may
return
with
that
sort
of
love
which
be
a
thing
of
custom
.
<EOS>
the
man
be
the
father
of
her
child
,
and
earn
the
bread
which
they
eat
and
which
she
eat
.
<EOS>
habit
and
the
way
of
the
world
require
that
she
should
be
careful
in
his
interest
,
and
that
she
should
live
with
him
in
what
amity
be
possible
to
them
.
<EOS>
but
as
for
love
,
 
all
that
we
mean
by
love
when
we
speak
of
it
and
write
of
it
,
 
a
blow
give
by
the
defender
to
the
defenceless
crush
it
all
!
<EOS>
a
woman
may
forgive
deceit
,
treachery
,
desertion
,
 
even
the
preference
give
to
a
rival
.
<EOS>
She
may
forgive
them
and
forget
them
;
but
I
do
not
think
that
a
woman
can
forget
a
blow
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
forgiveness
,
 
it
be
not
the
blow
that
she
can
not
forgive
,
but
the
meanness
of
spirit
that
make
it
possible
.
  
<EOS>
Kate
,
as
she
think
of
it
,
tell
herself
that
everything
in
life
be
over
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
long
fear
her
brother
's
nature
,
 
have
fear
that
he
be
hard
and
heartless
;
but
still
there
have
be
some
hope
with
her
fear
.
<EOS>
success
,
if
he
could
be
make
to
achieve
it
,
would
soften
him
,
and
then
all
may
be
right
.
<EOS>
but
now
all
be
wrong
,
and
she
know
that
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
compel
her
to
write
to
Alice
for
money
,
her
faith
in
him
have
almost
succumb
.
<EOS>
that
have
be
very
mean
,
and
the
meanness
have
shock
her
.
<EOS>
but
now
he
have
ask
her
to
perjure
herself
that
he
may
have
his
own
way
,
and
have
threaten
to
murder
her
,
and
have
raise
his
hand
against
her
because
she
have
refuse
to
obey
him
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
accuse
her
of
treachery
to
himself
,
 
have
accuse
her
of
premeditated
deceit
in
obtain
this
property
for
herself
!
  
<EOS>
"
but
he
do
not
believe
it
,
"
say
Kate
to
herself
.
"
<EOS>
He
say
that
because
he
think
it
would
vex
me
;
but
I
know
he
do
not
think
it
.
"
<EOS>
Kate
have
watch
her
brother
longing
for
money
all
his
life
,
 
have
thoroughly
understand
the
intensity
of
his
wish
for
it
,
 
the
agony
of
his
desire
.
<EOS>
but
so
far
removed
be
she
from
any
such
longing
on
her
own
account
,
that
she
could
not
believe
that
her
brother
would
in
his
heart
accuse
her
of
it
.
<EOS>
how
often
have
she
offer
to
give
him
,
on
the
instant
,
<EOS>
every
shilling
that
she
have
in
the
world
!
<EOS>
at
this
moment
she
resolve
,
in
her
mind
,
that
she
never
wish
to
see
him
more
;
but
even
now
,
have
it
be
practicable
,
she
would
have
make
over
to
him
,
without
any
drawback
,
all
her
interest
in
the
Vavasor
estate
.
  
<EOS>
but
any
such
making
over
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
John
Vavasor
remain
in
Westmoreland
for
a
week
,
and
during
that
time
many
discussion
be
,
of
course
,
hold
about
the
property
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Round
come
down
from
London
,
and
meet
Mr.
Gogram
at
Penrith
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
validity
of
the
will
Mr.
Round
say
that
there
be
no
shadow
of
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
so
an
agent
be
appoint
for
receive
the
rent
,
and
it
be
agree
that
the
old
Hall
should
be
let
in
six
month
from
that
date
.
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
Kate
be
to
remain
there
till
her
arm
should
become
strong
,
and
she
could
make
her
plan
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
Aunt
Greenow
promise
to
remain
at
the
Hall
for
the
present
,
and
offer
,
indeed
,
indefinite
service
for
the
future
,
as
though
she
be
quite
forgetful
of
Captain
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
she
be
not
forgetful
,
for
she
still
continue
to
speak
of
that
gentleman
to
Kate
,
as
though
he
be
Kate
's
suitor
.
<EOS>
but
she
do
not
now
press
upon
her
niece
the
acceptance
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
hand
as
an
absolute
duty
.
<EOS>
Kate
be
mistress
of
a
considerable
fortune
,
and
though
such
a
marriage
may
be
comfortable
,
it
be
no
longer
necessary
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
call
him
poor
Cheesacre
,
point
out
how
easily
he
may
be
manage
,
and
how
indubitable
be
his
possession
;
but
she
no
longer
speak
of
Kate
's
chance
in
the
marriage
market
as
desperate
,
even
though
she
should
decline
the
Cheesacre
alliance
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
young
woman
,
with
six
hundred
a
year

my
dear

may
do
pretty
nearly
what
she

aunt
Greenow

"
It

<EOS>
Kate
's
desire
be
that
Alice
should
come
down
to
her
for
a
while
in
Westmoreland
,
before
the
six
month
be
over
,
and
this
desire
she
mention
to
her
uncle
.
<EOS>
He
promise
to
carry
the
message
up
to
Alice
,
but
could
not
be
get
to
say
more
than
that
upon
the
subject
.
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Vavasor
go
away
,
leave
the
aunt
and
niece
together
at
the
Hall
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
on
earth
shall
we
do
if
that
wild
beast
show
himself
suddenly
among
us
woman
?
"
ask
Mrs.
Greenow
of
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
the
brother
could
only
say
,
"
that
he
hope
the
wild
beast
would
keep
his
distance
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
the
wild
beast
do
keep
his
distance
,
at
any
rate
as
long
as
Mrs.
Greenow
remain
at
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
We
will
now
go
back
to
the
wild
beast
,
and
tell
how
he
walk
across
the
mountain
,
in
the
rain
,
to
Bampton
,
a
little
village
at
the
foot
of
Haweswater
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
remember
that
after
he
have
strike
his
sister
,
he
turn
away
from
her
,
and
walk
with
quick
step
down
the
mountain
-
side
,
never
turn
back
to
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
find
himself
to
be
without
any
power
of
persuasion
over
her
,
as
regard
her
evidence
to
be
give
,
if
the
will
be
question
.
<EOS>
the
more
he
threaten
her
the
steady
she
have
be
in
assert
her
belief
in
her
grandfather
's
capacity
.
<EOS>
She
have
look
into
his
eye
and
defy
him
,
and
he
have
feel
himself
to
be
worst
.
<EOS>
what
be
he
to
do
?
<EOS>
in
truth
,
there
be
nothing
for
him
to
do
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
her
that
he
would
murder
her
;
and
in
the
state
of
mind
to
which
his
fury
have
drive
him
,
murder
have
suggest
itself
to
him
as
a
resource
to
which
he
may
apply
himself
.
<EOS>
but
what
could
he
gain
by
murder
her
,
 
or
,
at
any
rate
,
by
murder
her
then
,
out
on
the
mountain
-
side
?
<EOS>
nothing
but
a
hanging
!
<EOS>
there
would
be
no
gratification
even
to
his
revenge
.
<EOS>
if
,
indeed
,
he
have
murder
that
old
man
,
who
be
now
,
unfortunately
,
go
beyond
the
reach
of
murder
;
 
if
he
could
have
poison
the
old
man
's
cup
before
that
last
will
have
be
make
 
there
may
have
be
something
in
such
a
deed
!
<EOS>
but
he
have
merely
think
of
it
,
let
"
I
dare
not
wait
upon
I
would
"
 
as
he
now
tell
himself
,
with
much
self
-
reproach
.
<EOS>
nothing
be
to
be
get
by
kill
his
sister
.
<EOS>
so
he
restrain
himself
in
his
passion
,
and
walk
away
from
her
,
solitary
,
down
the
mountain
.
  
<EOS>
the
rain
soon
come
on
,
and
find
him
expose
on
the
hill
-
side
.
<EOS>
He
think
little
about
it
,
but
button
his
coat
,
as
I
have
say
before
,
and
strode
on
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
storm
of
rain
,
so
that
he
be
force
to
hold
his
head
to
one
side
,
as
it
hit
him
from
the
north
.
<EOS>
but
with
his
hand
to
his
hat
,
and
his
head
bent
against
the
wind
,
he
go
on
till
he
have
reach
the
valley
at
the
foot
,
and
find
that
the
track
by
which
he
have
be
lead
thither
have
become
a
road
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
know
the
mountain
round
the
Hall
as
Kate
have
know
them
,
and
be
not
aware
whither
he
be
go
.
<EOS>
on
one
thing
only
have
he
make
up
his
mind
since
he
have
leave
his
sister
,
and
that
be
that
he
would
not
return
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
could
do
nothing
there
to
serve
his
purpose
;
his
threat
would
be
vain
impotence
;
he
have
no
longer
any
friend
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
tell
himself
what
line
of
conduct
he
would
pursue
,
but
he
think
that
he
would
hurry
back
to
London
,
and
grasp
at
whatever
money
he
could
get
from
Alice
.
<EOS>
He
be
still
,
at
this
moment
,
a
Member
of
Parliament
;
and
as
the
rain
drench
him
through
and
through
,
he
endeavour
to
get
consolation
from
the
remembrance
of
that
fact
in
his
favour
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
get
near
the
village
he
overtake
a
shepherd
boy
come
down
from
the
hill
,
and
learn
his
whereabouts
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Baampton
,
"
say
the
boy
,
with
an
accent
that
be
almost
Scotch
,
when
he
be
ask
the
name
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
when
Vavasor
further
ask
whether
a
gig
be
keep
there
,
the
boy
simply
stare
at
him
,
not
know
a
gig
by
that
name
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
however
,
he
be
make
to
understand
the
nature
of
his
companion
's
want
,
and
express
his
belief
that
"
John
Applethwaite
,
up
at
the
Craigs
yon
,
have
get
a
mickle
cart
.
"
<EOS>
but
the
Craigs
be
a
farm
-
house
,
which
now
come
in
view
about
a
mile
off
,
up
across
the
valley
;
and
Vavasor
,
hope
that
he
may
still
find
a
speedy
conveyance
than
John
Applethwaite
's
mickle
cart
,
go
on
to
the
public
-
house
in
the
village
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
truth
,
neither
there
,
nor
yet
from
John
Applethwaite
,
to
whom
at
last
an
application
be
send
,
could
he
get
any
vehicle
;
and
between
six
and
seven
he
start
off
again
,
through
the
rain
,
to
make
his
weary
way
on
foot
to
Shap
.
<EOS>
the
distance
be
about
five
mile
,
and
the
little
byway
,
lie
between
wall
,
be
sticky
,
and
almost
glutinous
with
light
-
coloured
,
chalky
mud
.
<EOS>
before
he
start
he
take
a
glass
of
hot
rum
-
and
-
water
,
but
the
effect
of
that
soon
pass
away
from
him
,
and
then
he
become
cold
and
weak
than
he
have
be
before
.
  
<EOS>
wearily
and
wretchedly
he
plod
on
.
<EOS>
a
man
may
be
very
weary
in
such
a
walk
as
that
,
and
yet
be
by
no
mean
wretched
.
<EOS>
tired
,
hungry
,
cold
,
wet
,
and
nearly
penniless
,
I
have
sit
me
down
and
sleep
among
those
mountain
track
,
 
have
sleep
because
nature
refuse
to
allow
long
wakefulness
.
<EOS>
but
my
heart
have
be
as
light
as
my
purse
,
and
there
have
be
something
in
the
air
of
the
hill
that
make
me
buoyant
and
happy
in
the
midst
of
my
weariness
.
<EOS>
but
George
Vavasor
be
wretched
as
well
as
weary
,
and
every
step
that
he
take
,
plod
through
the
mud
,
be
a
new
misfortune
to
him
.
<EOS>
what
be
five
mile
of
a
walk
to
a
young
man
,
even
though
the
rain
be
fall
and
the
way
be
dirty
?
<EOS>
what
,
though
they
may
come
after
some
other
ten
that
he
have
already
traverse
on
his
foot
?
<EOS>
His
sister
Kate
would
have
think
nothing
of
the
distance
.
<EOS>
but
George
stop
on
his
way
from
time
to
time
,
lean
on
the
loose
wall
,
and
curse
the
misfortune
that
have
bring
him
to
such
a
pass
.
<EOS>
He
curse
his
grandfather
,
his
uncle
,
his
sister
,
his
cousin
,
and
himself
.
<EOS>
He
curse
the
place
in
which
his
forefather
have
live
,
and
he
curse
the
whole
county
.
<EOS>
He
curse
the
rain
,
and
the
wind
,
and
his
town
-
make
boot
,
which
would
not
keep
out
the
wet
slush
.
<EOS>
He
curse
the
light
as
it
fade
,
and
the
darkness
as
it
come
.
<EOS>
over
and
over
again
he
curse
the
will
that
have
rob
him
,
and
the
attorney
that
have
make
it
.
<EOS>
He
curse
the
mother
that
have
bear
him
and
the
father
that
have
leave
him
poor
.
<EOS>
He
think
of
Scruby
,
and
curse
him
,
think
how
that
money
would
be
again
require
of
him
by
that
stern
agent
.
<EOS>
He
curse
the
House
of
Commons
,
which
have
cost
him
so
much
,
and
the
greedy
elector
who
would
not
send
him
there
without
his
pay
for
it
.
<EOS>
He
curse
John
Grey
,
as
he
think
of
those
two
thousand
pound
,
with
double
curse
.
<EOS>
He
curse
this
world
,
and
all
world
beyond
;
and
thus
,
curse
everything
,
he
make
his
way
at
last
up
to
the
inn
at
Shap
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
nearly
nine
when
he
get
there
.
<EOS>
He
have
waste
over
an
hour
at
Bampton
in
his
endeavour
to
get
John
Applethwaite
's
cart
to
carry
him
on
,
and
he
have
be
two
hour
on
his
walk
from
Bampton
to
Shap
,
 
two
hour
amidst
his
cursing
.
<EOS>
He
order
supper
and
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
,
as
we
know
,
send
off
a
Mercury
for
his
clothe
.
<EOS>
but
the
Mercuries
of
Westmoreland
do
not
move
on
quick
wing
,
and
it
be
past
midnight
before
he
get
his
possession
.
<EOS>
during
all
this
time
he
have
,
by
no
mean
,
cease
from
cursing
,
but
continue
it
over
his
broil
ham
and
while
he
swallow
his
brandy
-
and
-
water
.
<EOS>
He
swear
aloud
,
so
that
the
red
-
armed
servant
at
the
inn
could
not
but
hear
him
,
that
those
thief
at
the
Hall
intend
to
rob
him
of
his
clothe
;
 
that
they
would
not
send
him
his
property
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
restrain
himself
,
though
he
know
that
every
word
he
utter
would
injure
his
cause
,
as
regard
the
property
in
Westmoreland
,
if
ever
he
could
make
a
cause
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
have
be
mad
to
strike
his
sister
,
and
curse
himself
for
his
madness
.
<EOS>
yet
he
could
not
restrain
himself
.
<EOS>
He
tell
himself
that
the
battle
for
him
be
over
,
and
he
think
of
poison
for
himself
.
<EOS>
He
think
of
poison
,
and
a
pistol
,
 
of
the
pistol
he
have
ever
load
at
home
,
each
with
six
shot
,
good
for
a
life
apiece
.
<EOS>
He
think
of
an
express
train
,
rush
along
at
its
full
career
,
and
of
the
instant
annihilation
which
it
would
produce
.
<EOS>
but
if
that
be
to
be
the
end
of
him
,
he
would
not
go
alone
.
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
why
should
he
go
alone
,
leave
those
pistol
ready
load
in
his
desk
?
<EOS>
among
them
they
have
bring
him
to
ruin
and
to
death
.
<EOS>
be
he
a
man
to
pardon
his
enemy
when
it
be
within
his
power
to
take
them
with
him
,
down
,
down
,
down
 
?
<EOS>
what
be
the
last
word
upon
his
impious
lip
,
as
with
bloodshot
eye
,
half
drunk
,
and
drive
by
the
Fury
,
he
take
himself
off
to
the
bed
prepared
for
him
,
curse
aloud
the
poor
red
-
haired
girl
as
he
go
,
I
may
not
utter
here
.
   
<EOS>
the
Pallisers
at
Breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
gentle
reader
,

you
remember
Lady
Monk

<EOS>
Mr.

<EOS>
He

Burgo
in
the
dining
-
room
,
under
the
argus
eye
of
the
constant
Bott
,
and
bear
her
away
home
.
<EOS>
Burgo

utterly
from
the
scene
,
and
Mr.
Bott
,
complain
inwardly
that
virtue
be
too
frequently
allow
to
be
its
own
reward
,
comfort
himself
with
champagne
,
and
then
walk
off
to
his
lodging
.
<EOS>
Lady

when
Mr.
Palliser
make
his
way
into
her
room
up

,
seek
his
wife

scarf
,
 
which
little
incident
,
also
,
the
reader
may
perhaps
remember
,
 
see
that
the
game
be
up
,
and
think
with
regret
of
the
loss
of
her
two
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
ending
of
Lady
Monk
's
party
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
on
her
journey
home
in
the
carriage
with
her
husband
,
have
openly
suggest
that
Mrs.
Marsham
have
go
to
Park
Lane
to
tell
of
her
doing
with
Burgo
,
and
have
declare
her
resolution
never
again
to
see
either
that
lady
or
Mr.
Bott
in
her
own
house
.
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
she
say
with
more
of
defiance
in
her
tone
than
Mr.
Palliser
have
ever
hitherto
hear
.
<EOS>
He
be
by
nature
less
ready
than
her
,
and
know
his
own
deficiency
in
that
respect
,
abstain
from
all
answer
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
during
that
drive
home
very
few
further
word
be
speak
between
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
breakfast
with
you
to

,
"
he
say
to
her
,
as
she
prepare
to
go
up
-

.
<EOS>
"
I

work
still
to

,
and
I
will
not
disturb
you
by
come
to
your
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
want
me
to
be
very
early
?
"
say
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
he
,
with
more
of
anger
in
his
voice
than
he
have
yet
show
.
<EOS>
"
what
hour
will
suit
you
?
<EOS>
I
must
say
something
of
what
have
occur
to
-
night
before
I
leave
you
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
you
can
have
get
to
say
about
to
-
night
,
but
I
will
be
down
by
half
-
past
eleven
,
if
that
will
do
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
say
that
he
would
make
it
do
,
and
then
they
part
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
have
play
her
part
very
well
before
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
have
decline
to
be
frighten
by
him
;
have
be
the
first
to
mention
Burgo
's
name
,
and
have
do
so
with
no
tremor
in
her
voice
,
and
have
boldly
declare
her
irreconcilable
enmity
to
the
male
and
female
duenna
who
have
dare
to
take
her
in
charge
.
<EOS>
while
she
be
in
the
carriage
with
her
husband
she
feel
some
triumph
in
her
own
strength
;
and
as
she
wish
him
good
night
on
the
staircase
,
and
slowly
walk
up
to
her
room
,
without
have
once
lower
her
eye
before
his
,
something
of
this
consciousness
of
triumph
still
support
her
.
<EOS>
and
even
while
her
maid
remain
with
her
she
hold
herself
up
,
as
it
be
,
inwardly
,
tell
herself
that
she
would
not
yield
,
 
that
she
would
not
be
cow
either
by
her
husband
or
by
his
spy
.
<EOS>
but
when
she
be
leave
alone
all
her
triumph
depart
from
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
bid
her
maid
go
while
she
be
still
sit
in
her
dressing
-
gown
;
and
when
the
girl
be
go
<EOS>
she
get
close
over
the
fire
,
sit
with
her
slipper
on
the
fender
,
with
her
elbow
on
her
knee
,
and
her
face
rest
on
her
hand
.
<EOS>
in
this
position
she
remain
for
an
hour
,
with
her
eye
fix
on
the
alter
shape
of
the
hot
coal
.
<EOS>
during
this
hour
her
spirit
be
by
no
means
defiant
,
and
her
thought
of
herself
anything
but
triumphant
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
and
Mrs.
Marsham
she
have
forget
altogether
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
they
be
but
buzzing
fly
,
who
annoy
her
by
their
presence
.
<EOS>
Should
she
choose
to
leave
her
husband
,
they
could
not
prevent
her
leave
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
her
husband
and
of
Burgo
that
she
be
think
,
 
weigh
them
one
against
the
other
,
and
connect
her
own
existence
with
theirs
,
not
as
expect
joy
or
the
comfort
of
love
from
either
of
them
,
but
with
an
assured
conviction
that
on
either
side
there
must
be
misery
for
her
.
<EOS>
but
of
that
shame
before
all
the
world
which
must
be
her
for
ever
,
should
she
break
her
vow
and
consent
to
live
with
a
man
who
be
not
her
husband
,
she
think
hardly
at
all
.
<EOS>
that
which
in
the
estimation
of
Alice
be
everything
,
to
her
,
at
this
moment
,
be
almost
nothing
.
<EOS>
for
herself
,
she
have
be
sacrifice
;
and
,
 
as
she
tell
herself
with
bitter
denunciation
against
herself
,
 
have
be
sacrifice
through
her
own
weakness
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
do
.
<EOS>
whatever
way
she
may
go
,
she
be
lose
.
<EOS>
They
have
marry
her
to
a
man
who
care
nothing
for
a
wife
,
nothing
for
any
woman
,
 
so
at
least
she
declare
to
herself
,
 
but
who
have
want
a
wife
that
he
may
have
an
heir
.
<EOS>
have
it
be
give
to
her
to
have
a
child
<EOS>
,
she
think
that
she
may
have
be
happy
,
 
sufficiently
happy
in
share
her
husband
's
joy
in
that
respect
.
<EOS>
but
everything
have
go
against
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
in
her
home
to
give
her
comfort
.
"
<EOS>
He
look
at
me
every
time
he
see
me
as
the
cause
of
his
misfortune
,
"
she
say
to
herself
.
<EOS>
of
her
husband
's
rank
,
of
the
future
possession
of
his
title
and
his
estate
,
she
think
much
.
<EOS>
but
of
her
own
wealth
she
think
nothing
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
occur
to
her
that
she
have
give
him
enough
in
that
respect
to
make
his
marriage
with
her
a
comfort
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
take
it
for
grant
that
that
marriage
be
now
one
distasteful
to
him
,
as
it
be
to
herself
,
and
that
he
would
eventually
be
the
gainer
if
she
should
so
conduct
herself
that
her
marriage
may
be
dissolve
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
Burgo
,
I
doubt
whether
she
deceive
herself
much
as
to
his
character
.
<EOS>
She
know
well
enough
that
he
be
a
man
infinitely
less
worthy
than
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
he
be
a
spendthrift
,
idle
,
give
to
bad
course
,
 
that
he
drink
,
that
he
gamble
,
that
he
live
the
life
of
the
loose
man
about
the
town
.
<EOS>
She
know
also
that
whatever
chance
she
may
have
have
to
redeem
him
,
have
she
marry
him
honestly
before
all
the
world
,
there
could
be
no
such
chance
if
she
go
to
him
as
his
mistress
,
abandon
her
husband
and
all
her
duty
,
and
make
herself
vile
in
the
eye
of
all
woman
.
<EOS>
Burgo
Fitzgerald
would
not
be
influence
for
good
by
such
a
woman
as
she
would
then
be
.
<EOS>
She
know
much
of
the
world
and
its
way
,
and
tell
herself
no
lie
about
this
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
have
say
before
,
she
do
not
count
herself
for
much
.
<EOS>
what
though
she
be
ruin
?
<EOS>
what
though
Burgo
be
false
,
mean
,
and
untrustworthy
?
<EOS>
She
love
him
,
and
he
be
the
only
man
she
ever
have
love
!
<EOS>
low
and
lower
<EOS>
she
crouch
before
the
fire
;
and
then
,
when
the
coal
be
no
longer
red
,
and
the
shape
alter
themselves
no
more
,
she
creep
into
bed
.
<EOS>
as
to
what
she
should
say
to
her
husband
on
the
follow
morning
,
 
she
have
not
yet
begin
to
think
of
that
.
  
<EOS>
exactly
at
half
-
past
eleven
she
enter
the
little
breakfast
parlour
which
look
out
over
the
park
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
prettiest
room
in
the
house
,
and
now
,
at
this
springtide
,
when
the
town
tree
be
put
out
their
early
green
,
and
be
fresh
and
bright
almost
as
country
tree
,
it
may
be
hard
to
find
a
pretty
chamber
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
be
there
already
,
sit
with
the
morning
paper
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
rise
when
she
enter
,
and
,
come
up
to
her
,
just
touch
her
with
his
lip
.
<EOS>
She
put
her
cheek
up
to
him
,
and
then
take
her
place
at
the
breakfast
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
any
headache
this
morning
?
"
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
then
he
take
his
tea
and
his
toast
,
speak
some
word
to
her
about
the
fineness
of
the
weather
,
tell
her
some
scrap
of
news
,
and
soon
return
to
the
absorb
interest
of
a
speech
make
by
the
leader
of
the
Opposition
in
the
House
of
Lords
.
<EOS>
the
speech
be
very
interesting
to
Mr.
Palliser
,
because
in
it
the
noble
lord
allude
to
a
break
-
up
in
the
present
Cabinet
,
as
to
which
the
rumour
be
,
he
say
,
so
rife
through
the
country
as
to
have
destroy
all
that
feeling
of
security
in
the
exist
government
which
the
country
so
much
value
and
desire
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
have
as
yet
hear
no
official
tiding
of
such
a
rupture
;
but
if
such
rupture
be
to
take
place
,
it
must
be
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
He
feel
himself
at
this
moment
to
be
full
of
politic
,
 
to
be
near
the
object
of
his
ambition
,
to
have
affair
upon
his
hand
which
require
all
his
attention
.
<EOS>
be
it
absolutely
incumbent
on
him
to
refer
again
to
the
incident
of
last
night
?
<EOS>
the
do
so
would
be
odious
to
him
.
<EOS>
the
remembrance
of
the
task
now
immediately
before
him
destroy
all
his
political
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
believe
that
his
wife
be
in
any
serious
danger
.
<EOS>
may
it
not
yet
be
possible
for
him
to
escape
from
the
annoyance
,
and
to
wash
his
mind
clean
of
all
suspicion
?
<EOS>
He
be
not
jealous
;
he
be
indeed
incapable
of
jealousy
.
<EOS>
He
know
what
it
would
be
to
be
dishonour
,
and
he
know
that
under
certain
circumstance
the
world
would
expect
him
to
exert
himself
in
a
certain
way
.
<EOS>
but
the
thing
that
he
have
now
to
do
be
a
great
trouble
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
rather
have
to
address
the
House
of
Commons
with
ten
column
of
figure
than
utter
a
word
of
remonstrance
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
defy
him
,
 
defy
him
by
say
that
she
would
see
his
friend
no
more
;
and
it
be
the
remembrance
of
this
,
as
he
sit
behind
his
newspaper
,
that
make
him
ultimately
feel
that
he
could
not
pass
in
silence
over
what
have
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
go
on
reading
,
or
pretend
to
read
,
as
long
as
the
continuance
of
the
breakfast
make
it
certain
that
his
wife
would
remain
with
him
.
<EOS>
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
he
say
some
word
to
her
of
what
he
be
read
,
endeavour
to
use
the
tone
of
voice
that
be
customary
to
him
in
his
domestic
teaching
of
politic
.
<EOS>
but
through
it
all
there
be
a
certain
hesitation
,
 
there
be
the
sure
sign
of
an
attempt
be
make
,
of
which
he
be
himself
conscious
,
and
which
she
understand
with
the
most
perfect
accuracy
.
<EOS>
He
be
defer
the
evil
moment
,
and
vainly
endeavour
to
make
himself
believe
that
he
be
comfortably
employ
the
while
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
newspaper
,
and
make
no
endeavour
to
deceive
herself
.
<EOS>
She
,
therefore
,
be
the
first
to
begin
the
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Plantagenet
,
"
she
say
,
"
you
tell
me
last
night
,
as
I
be
go
to
bed
,
that
you
have
something
to
say
about
Lady
Monk
's
party
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
down
the
newspaper
slowly
,
and
turn
towards
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
after
what
happen
,
I
believe
that
I
must
say
something
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
think
anything
,
pray
say
it
,
"
say
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
always
easy
for
a
man
to
show
what
he
think
by
what
he
say
,
"
he
reply
.
<EOS>
"
My
fear
be
that
you
should
suppose
me
to
think
more
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
for
that
reason
that
I
determine
to
sleep
on
it
before
I
speak
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
anybody
be
angry
with
me
<EOS>
I
would
much
<EOS>
rather
they
should
have
it
out
with
me
while
their
anger
be
hot
.
<EOS>
I
hate
cold
anger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
be
not
angry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
what
husband
always
say
when
they
be
go
to
scold
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
be
not
go
to
scold
.
<EOS>
I
be
only
go
to
advise
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
sooner
be
scold
.
<EOS>
advice
be
to
anger
just
what
cold
anger
be
to
hot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
my
dear
Glencora
,
surely
if
I
find
it
necessary
to
speak
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
to
stop
you
,
Plantagenet
.
<EOS>
pray
,
go
on
.
<EOS>
only
it
will
be
so
nice
to
have
it
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
now
more
than
ever
averse
to
the
task
before
him
.
<EOS>
husband
,
when
they
give
their
wife
a
talking
,
should
do
it
out
of
hand
,
utter
their
word
hard
,
sharp
,
and
quick
,
 
and
should
then
go
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
work
that
will
not
bear
a
preface
,
and
this
work
of
marital
fault
-
finding
be
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
be
already
begin
to
find
out
the
truth
of
this
.
<EOS>
"
Glencora
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
wish
you
to
be
serious
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
serious
,
"
she
reply
,
as
she
settle
herself
in
her
chair
with
an
air
of
mockery
,
while
her
eye
and
mouth
be
bright
and
eloquent
with
a
spirit
which
her
husband
do
not
love
to
see
.
<EOS>
poor
girl
!
<EOS>
there
be
seriousness
enough
in
store
for
her
before
she
would
be
able
to
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
be
serious
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
why
Mrs.
Marsham
come
here
from
Lady
Monk
's
last
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
do
.
<EOS>
She
come
to
tell
you
that
I
be
waltz
with
Burgo
Fitzgerald

<EOS>
You
may
as
well
ask
me
whether
I
know
why

at

glare
at

very

it
be
hard

upright

<EOS>
He
say
that
he
love
me
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
to
herself
,
"
but
he
do
not
know
what
love
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
she
be
quite
aware
that
he
have
behave
to
her
with
genuine
,
true
nobility
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
be
alone
and
certain
of
her
solitude
,
she
take
out
that
letter
from
her
pocket
,
and
tear
it
into
very
small
fragment
,
without
read
it
,
throw
the
piece
on
the
fire
.
<EOS>
as
she
do
so
,
her
mind
seem
to
be
fix
,
at
any
rate
,
to
one
thing
,
 
that
she
would
think
no
more
of
Burgo
Fitzgerald
as
her
future
master
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
however
,
that
she
have
arrive
at
so
much
certainty
as
this
,
at
that
moment
in
which
she
have
be
part
with
Burgo
Fitzgerald
,
in
Lady
Monk
's
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
have
have
courage
enough
,
 
or
shall
we
rather
say
sin
enough
,
 
to
think
of
go
with
him
,
 
to
tell
herself
that
she
would
do
so
;
to
put
herself
in
the
way
of
do
it
;
nay
,
she
have
have
enough
of
both
to
enable
her
to
tell
her
husband
that
she
have
resolve
that
it
would
be
good
for
her
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
neither
bold
enough
nor
wicked
enough
to
do
the
thing
.
<EOS>
as
she
have
say
of
her
own
idea
of
destroy
herself
,
 
she
do
not
dare
to
take
the
plunge
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
know
now
that
it
be
so
,
she
tear
up
the
letter
that
she
have
carry
so
long
,
and
burn
it
in
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
in
truth
tell
him
everything
,
believe
that
in
do
so
she
be
deliver
her
own
death
-
warrant
as
regard
her
future
position
in
his
house
.
<EOS>
She
have
do
this
,
not
hope
thereby
for
any
escape
;
not
with
any
purpose
as
regard
herself
,
but
simply
because
deceit
have
be
grievous
to
her
,
and
have
become
unendurable
as
soon
as
his
word
and
manner
have
in
them
any
feeling
of
kindness
.
<EOS>
but
her
confession
have
no
sooner
be
make
than
her
fault
have
be
forgive
.
<EOS>
She
have
tell
him
that
she
do
not
love
him
.
<EOS>
She
have
tell
him
,
even
,
that
she
have
think
of
leave
him
.
<EOS>
She
have
justify
by
her
own
word
any
treatment
of
his
,
however
harsh
,
which
he
may
choose
to
practise
.
<EOS>
but
the
result
have
be
 
the
immediate
result
 
that
he
have
be
more
tender
to
her
than
she
have
ever
remember
him
to
be
before
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
he
have
conquer
her
.
<EOS>
however
cold
and
heartless
his
home
may
be
to
her
,
it
must
be
her
home
now
.
<EOS>
there
could
be
no
further
thought
of
leave
him
.
<EOS>
She
have
go
out
into
the
tiltyard
and
have
tilt
with
him
,
and
he
have
be
the
victor
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
himself
have
not
time
for
much
thought
before
he
find
himself
closet
with
the
Duke
;
but
as
he
cross
the
hall
and
go
up
the
stair
,
a
thought
or
two
do
pass
quickly
across
his
mind
.
<EOS>
She
have
confess
to
him
,
and
he
have
forgive
her
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
feel
quite
sure
that
he
have
be
right
,
but
he
do
feel
quite
sure
that
the
thing
have
be
do
.
<EOS>
He
recognize
it
for
a
fact
that
,
as
regard
the
past
,
no
more
be
to
be
say
.
<EOS>
there
be
to
be
no
reproach
,
and
there
must
be
some
tacit
abandoning
of
Mrs.
Marsham
's
close
attendance
.
<EOS>
as
to
Mr.
Bott
;
 
he
have
begin
to
hate
Mr.
Bott
,
and
have
feel
cruelly
ungrateful
,
when
that
gentleman
endeavour
to
whisper
a
word
into
his
ear
as
he
pass
through
the
doorway
into
Lady
Monk
's
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
and
he
have
offer
to
go
abroad
,
 
to
go
abroad
and
leave
his
politic
,
and
his
ambition
,
and
his
come
honour
.
<EOS>
He
have
persist
in
his
offer
,
even
after
his
wife
have
suggest
to
him
that
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
be
now
in
the
house
with
the
object
of
offer
him
that
very
thing
for
which
he
have
so
long
!
<EOS>
as
he
think
of
this
his
heart
become
heavy
within
him
.
<EOS>
such
chance
,
 
so
he
tell
himself
,
 
do
not
come
twice
in
a
man
's
way
.
<EOS>
when
return
from
a
twelvemonth
's
residence
abroad
he
would
be
nobody
in
politic
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
lose
everything
for
which
he
have
be
work
all
his
life
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
a
man
of
his
word
,
and
as
he
open
the
library
door
he
be
resolute
,
 
<EOS>
he
think
that
he
could
be
resolute
in
adhere
to
his
promise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Duke
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
be
afraid
I
have
keep
you
wait
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
two
political
ally
shake
each
other
by
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
the
Duke
be
in
a
glow
of
delight
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
no
waiting
.
<EOS>
He
be
only
too
glad
to
find
his
friend
at
home
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
prepare
to
wait
,
even
if
Mr.
Palliser
have
be
out
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
suppose
you
guess
why
I
be
come
?
"
say
the
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
be
tell
than
have
to
guess
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
,
smile
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
but
the
smile
quickly
pass
off
his
face
as
he
remember
his
pledge
to
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
resign
at
last
.
<EOS>
what
be
say
in
the
Lords
last
night
make
it
necessary
that
he
should
do
so
,
or
that
Lord
Brock
should
declare
himself
able
to
support
him
through
thick
and
thin
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
can
tell
you
everything
now
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
go
,
or
I
must
have
do
so
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
I
do
not
like
him
in
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
I
admire
his
character
and
his
genius
,
but
I
think
him
the
most
dangerous
man
in
England
as
a
statesman
.
<EOS>
He
have
high
principle
,
 
the
very
high
;
but
they
be
so
high
as
to
be
out
of
sight
to
ordinary
eye
.
<EOS>
They
be
too
exalted
to
be
of
any
use
for
everyday
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
be
honest
as
the
sun
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
;
but
it
be
just
like
the
sun
's
honesty
,
 
of
a
kind
which
we
man
below
can
not
quite
understand
or
appreciate
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
instinct
in
politic
,
but
reach
his
conclusion
by
philosophical
deduction
.
<EOS>
now
,
in
politic
,
I
would
a
deal
soon
trust
to
instinct
than
to
calculation
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
may
probably
know
how
England
ought
to
be
govern
three
century
hence
better
than
any
man
live
,
but
of
the
proper
way
to
govern
it
now
,
I
think
he
know
less
.
<EOS>
brock
half
like
him
and
half
fear
him
.
<EOS>
He
like
the
support
of
his
eloquence
,
and
he
like
the
power
of
the
man
;
but
he
fear
his
restless
activity
,
and
thoroughly
dislike
his
philosophy
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
he
have
leave
us
,
and
I
be
here
to
ask
you
to
take
his
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
Duke
,
as
he
conclude
his
speech
,
be
quite
contented
,
and
almost
jovial
.
<EOS>
He
be
thoroughly
satisfied
with
the
new
political
arrangement
which
he
be
propose
.
<EOS>
He
regard
Mr.
Palliser
as
a
steady
,
practical
man
of
business
,
luckily
young
,
and
therefore
with
a
deal
of
work
in
him
,
belong
to
the
race
from
which
english
minister
ought
,
in
his
opinion
,
to
be
take
,
and
as
be
,
in
some
respect
,
his
own
pupil
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
the
first
to
declare
aloud
that
Plantagenet
Palliser
be
the
come
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
;
and
it
have
be
long
know
,
though
no
such
declaration
have
be
make
aloud
,
that
the
Duke
do
not
sit
comfortably
in
the
same
Cabinet
with
the
gentleman
who
have
now
resign
.
<EOS>
everything
have
now
go
as
the
Duke
wish
;
and
he
be
prepared
to
celebrate
some
little
ovation
with
his
young
friend
before
he
leave
the
house
in
Park
Lane
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
who
go
out
with
him
?
"
ask
Mr.
Palliser
,
put
off
the
evil
moment
of
his
own
decision
;
but
before
the
Duke
could
answer
him
,
he
have
remind
himself
that
under
his
present
circumstance
he
have
no
right
to
ask
such
a
question
.
<EOS>
His
own
decision
could
not
rest
upon
that
point
.
<EOS>
"
but
it
do
not
matter
,
"
he
say
;
"
I
be
afraid
I
must
decline
the
offer
you
bring
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
decline
it
!
"
say
the
Duke
,
who
could
not
have
be
more
surprised
have
his
friend
talk
of
decline
heaven
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
I
must
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Duke
have
now
rise
from
his
chair
,
and
be
stand
,
with
both
his
hand
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
all
his
contentment
,
all
his
joviality
,
have
vanish
.
<EOS>
His
fine
round
face
have
become
almost
ludicrously
long
;
his
eye
and
mouth
be
struggle
to
convey
reproach
,
and
the
reproach
be
almost
drown
in
vexation
.
<EOS>
ever
since
Parliament
have
meet
he
have
be
whisper
Mr.
Palliser
's
name
into
the
Prime
Minister
's
ear
,
and
now
 
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
,
and
would
not
,
believe
it
.
<EOS>
"
nonsense
,
Palliser
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
get
some
false
notion
into
your
head
.
<EOS>
there
can
be
no
possible
reason
why
you
should
not
join
us
.
<EOS>
Finespun
himself
will
support
us
,
at
any
rate
for
a
time
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Finespun
be
the
gentleman
whose
retirement
from
the
ministry
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
have
now
announce
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
nothing
of
that
kind
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
perhaps
feel
himself
quite
equal
to
the
duty
propose
to
him
,
even
though
Mr.
Finespun
should
not
support
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
nothing
of
that
kind
;
 
it
be
no
fear
of
that
sort
that
hinder
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
for
mercy
's
sake
,
what
be
it
?
<EOS>
My
dear
palliser
,
I
look
upon
you
as
be
as
sure
in
this
matter
as
myself
;
and
I
have
a
right
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
You
certainly
intend
to
join
us
a
month
ago
,
if
the
opportunity
offer
.
<EOS>
You
certainly
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
true
,
Duke
.
<EOS>
I
must
ask
you
to
listen
to
me
now
,
and
I
must
tell
you
what
I
would
not
willingly
tell
to
any
man
.
"
<EOS>
as
Mr.
Palliser
say
this
a
look
of
agony
come
over
his
face
.
<EOS>
there
be
man
who
can
talk
easily
of
all
their
most
inmost
matter
,
but
he
be
not
such
a
man
.
<EOS>
It
go
sorely
against
the
grain
with
him
to
speak
of
the
sorrow
of
his
home
,
even
to
such
a
friend
as
the
Duke
;
but
it
be
essentially
necessary
to
him
that
he
should
justify
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
"
say
the
Duke
,
"
I
can
not
understand
that
there
should
be
any
reason
strong
enough
to
make
you
throw
your
party
over

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
promise
to
take
my
wife
abroad

<EOS>
"
be
that
it
?
"
say
the
Duke
,
look
at
him
with
surprise
,
but
at
the
same
time
with
something
of
return
joviality
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
nobody
think
of
go
abroad
at
this
time
of
the
year

course

you
can
get
away
for
a
time
when
Parliament
break
up

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
have
promise
to
go
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
then
,
consider
your
position

you
have
make
a
promise

it
behove
you
to
break

I
be
sure
Lady
Glencora
will
see
it
in

light

You
do

<EOS>
a
certain
stiffness
of
demeanour

measure
propriety

much
at
variance
with
his
former
manner

upon

I
do

if
you
will
allow
me

have
tell
me
that

this
morning

make
me
feel

absence

requisite

Palliser

think
of

this
be
a
small
matter

I
would
not
press
you

a

have
public
duty

He
owe

"
  
<EOS>

of

not

may
be
absolve
from

absolve
me

happiness
demand
it

it

partly
my
fault

so

possible
that
I
should
speak
to
Lady
Glencora
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
could
be
of
no
avail
,
Duke
.
<EOS>
She
would
only
declare
,
at
the
first
word
,
that
she
would
remain
in
London
;
but
it
would
not
be
the
less
my
duty
on
that
account
to
take
her
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
;
I
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
such
an
opportunity
may
not
come
twice
in
a
man
's
life
.
<EOS>
and
at
your
age
too
!
<EOS>
You
be
throw
away
from
you
the
fine
political
position
that
the
world
can
offer
to
the
ambition
of
any
man
.
<EOS>
no
one
at
your
time
of
life
have
have
such
a
chance
within
my
memory
.
<EOS>
that
a
man
under
thirty
should
be
think
fit
to
be
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
and
should
refuse
it
,
 
because
he
want
to
take
his
wife
abroad
!
<EOS>
Palliser
,
if
she
be
die
,
you
should
remain
under
such
an
emergency
as
this
.
<EOS>
She
may
go
,
but
you
should
remain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
remain
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
in
his
chair
;
he
then
rise
and
walk
towards
the
window
,
as
he
speak
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
thing
bad
than
death
,
"
he
say
,
when
his
back
be
turn
.
<EOS>
His
voice
be
very
low
,
and
there
be
a
tear
in
his
eye
as
he
speak
them
;
the
word
be
indeed
whisper
,
but
the
Duke
hear
them
,
and
feel
that
he
could
not
press
him
any
more
on
the
subject
of
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
must
this
be
final
?
"
say
the
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
must
.
<EOS>
but
your
visit
here
have
come
so
quickly
on
my
resolution
to
go
abroad
,
 
which
,
in
truth
,
be
only
make
ten
minute
before
your
name
be
bring
to
me
,
 
that
I
believe
I
ought
to
ask
for
a
portion
of
those
twenty
-
four
hour
which
you
have
offer
me
.
<EOS>
a
small
portion
will
be
enough
.
<EOS>
Will
you
see
me
,
if
I
come
to
you
this
evening
,
say
at
eight
?
<EOS>
if
the
House
be
up
in
the
Lords
I
will
go
to
you
in
St.
James
's
Square
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
sit
after
eight
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
see
you
there
.
<EOS>
and
,
Duke
,
I
must
ask
you
to
think
of
me
in
this
matter
as
a
friend
should
think
,
and
not
as
though
we
be
bind
together
only
by
party
feeling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
 
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
tell
you
what
I
shall
never
whisper
to
any
one
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
know
that
you
be
safe
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
and
,
Duke
,
I
can
tell
you
that
the
sacrifice
to
me
will
be
almost
more
than
I
can
bear
.
<EOS>
this
thing
that
you
have
offer
me
to
-
day
be
the
only
thing
that
I
have
ever
covet
.
<EOS>
I
have
think
of
it
and
work
for
it
,
have
hope
and
despair
,
have
for
moment
be
vain
enough
to
think
that
it
be
within
my
strength
,
and
have
be
wretche
for
week
together
because
I
have
tell
myself
that
it
be
utterly
beyond
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
to
that
,
neither
Brock
nor
I
,
nor
any
of
us
,
have
any
doubt
.
<EOS>
Finespun
himself
say
that
you
be
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
much
oblige
to
them
.
<EOS>
but
I
say
all
this
simply
that
you
may
understand
how
imperative
be
the
duty
which
,
as
I
think
,
require
me
to
refuse
the
offer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
have
not
refuse
as
yet
,
"
say
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
wait
at
the
House
for
you
,
whether
they
be
sit
or
not
.
<EOS>
and
endeavour
to
join
us
.
<EOS>
do
the
good
you
can
.
<EOS>
I
will
say
nothing
as
to
that
duty
of
which
you
speak
;
but
if
it
can
be
make
compatible
with
your
public
service
,
pray
 
pray
let
it
be
do
.
<EOS>
remember
how
much
such
a
one
as
you
owe
to
his
country
.
"
<EOS>
then
the
Duke
go
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
be
alone
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
not
be
alone
before
since
the
revelation
which
have
be
make
to
him
by
his
wife
,
and
the
word
she
have
speak
be
still
sound
in
his
ear
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
love
Burgo
Fitzgerald
;
 
I
do
!
<EOS>
I
do
!
<EOS>
I
do
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
They
be
not
pleasant
word
for
a
young
husband
to
hear
.
<EOS>
man
there
be
,
no
doubt
,
whose
nature
would
make
them
more
miserable
under
the
infliction
than
it
have
make
Plantagenet
Palliser
.
<EOS>
He
be
calm
,
without
strong
passion
,
not
prone
to
give
to
word
a
strong
significance
than
they
should
bear
;
 
and
he
be
essentially
unsuspicious
.
<EOS>
never
for
a
moment
have
he
think
,
even
while
those
word
be
hiss
in
his
ear
,
that
his
wife
have
betray
his
honour
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
there
be
that
at
his
heart
,
as
he
remember
those
word
,
which
make
him
feel
that
the
world
be
almost
too
heavy
for
him
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
after
the
Duke
's
departure
he
think
more
of
his
wife
and
of
Burgo
Fitzgerald
than
he
do
of
Lord
Brock
and
Mr.
Finespun
.
<EOS>
but
of
this
he
be
aware
,
 
that
he
have
forgive
his
wife
;
that
he
have
put
his
arm
round
her
and
embrace
her
after
hear
her
confession
,
 
and
that
she
,
mutely
,
with
her
eye
,
have
promise
him
that
she
would
do
her
good
for
him
.
<EOS>
then
something
of
an
idea
of
love
come
across
his
heart
,
and
he
acknowledge
to
himself
that
he
have
marry
without
love
or
without
require
love
.
<EOS>
much
of
all
this
have
be
his
own
fault
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
have
not
the
whole
of
it
come
from
his
own
wrong
-
doing
?
<EOS>
He
acknowledge
that
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
 
now
he
love
her
.
<EOS>
He
feel
that
he
could
not
bear
to
part
with
her
,
even
if
there
be
no
question
of
public
scandal
,
or
of
disgrace
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
tear
inwardly
by
that
assertion
that
she
love
another
man
.
<EOS>
She
have
get
at
his
heart
-
string
at
last
.
<EOS>
there
be
man
who
may
love
their
wife
,
though
they
never
can
have
be
in
love
before
their
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
Duke
have
be
go
about
an
hour
,
and
when
,
under
ordinary
circumstance
,
it
would
have
be
his
time
to
go
down
to
the
House
,
he
take
his
hat
and
walk
into
the
Park
.
<EOS>
He
make
his
way
across
Hyde
Park
,
and
into
Kensington
Gardens
,
and
there
he
remain
for
an
hour
,
walk
up
and
down
beneath
the
elm
.
<EOS>
the
quidnuncs
of
the
town
,
who
chance
to
see
him
,
and
who
have
hear
something
of
the
political
movement
of
the
day
,
think
,
no
doubt
,
that
he
be
meditate
his
future
ministerial
career
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
not
be
there
long
before
he
have
resolve
that
no
ministerial
career
be
at
present
open
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
have
be
my
own
fault
,
"
he
say
,
as
he
return
to
his
house
,
"
and
with
God
's
help
I
will
mend
it
,
if
it
be
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
he
be
a
slow
man
,
and
he
do
not
go
off
instantly
to
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
He
have
give
himself
to
eight
o'clock
,
and
he
take
the
full
time
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
go
down
to
the
House
of
Commons
because
man
would
make
inquiry
of
him
which
he
would
find
it
difficult
to
answer
.
<EOS>
so
he
dine
at
home
,
alone
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
his
wife
that
he
would
see
her
at
nine
,
and
before
that
hour
he
would
not
go
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
sit
alone
till
it
be
time
for
him
to
get
into
his
brougham
,
and
think
it
all
over
.
<EOS>
that
seat
in
the
Cabinet
and
Chancellorship
of
the
Exchequer
,
which
he
have
so
infinitely
desire
,
be
already
do
with
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
about
that
.
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
well
for
him
not
to
have
marry
;
but
now
that
he
be
married
,
and
that
thing
have
bring
him
untowardly
to
this
pass
,
he
know
that
his
wife
's
safety
be
his
first
duty
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
go
through
Switzerland
,
"
he
say
to
himself
,
"
to
Baden
,
and
then
we
will
get
on
to
Florence
and
to
Rome
.
<EOS>
She
have
see
nothing
of
all
these
thing
yet
,
and
the
new
life
will
make
a
change
in
her
.
<EOS>
She
shall
have
her
own
friend
with
her
.
"
<EOS>
then
he
go
down
to
the
House
of
Lords
,
and
see
the
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Palliser
,
"
say
the
Duke
,
when
he
have
listen
to
him
,
"
<EOS>
of
course
I
can
not
argue
it
with
you
any
more
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
that
I
be
very
sorry
;
 
more
sorry
than
perhaps
you
will
believe
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
half
break
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Duke
's
voice
be
very
sad
,
and
it
may
almost
have
be
think
that
he
be
go
to
shed
a
tear
.
<EOS>
in
truth
he
dislike
Mr.
Finespun
with
the
strong
political
feeling
of
which
he
be
capable
,
and
have
attach
himself
to
Mr.
Palliser
almost
as
strongly
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
thousand
pity
!
<EOS>
how
hard
have
he
not
work
to
bring
about
this
arrangement
,
which
be
now
to
be
upset
because
a
woman
have
be
foolish
!
<EOS>
"
I
never
above
half
like
her
,
"
say
the
Duke
to
himself
,
think
perhaps
a
little
of
the
Duchess
's
complaint
of
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
to
Brock
at
once
,
"
he
say
aloud
,
"
and
tell
him
.
<EOS>
God
know
what
we
must
do
now

<EOS>
goodbye
!
<EOS>
good
-
bye
!
<EOS>
no
;
I
be
not
angry
.
<EOS>
there
shall
be
no
quarrel

but
I
be
very
sorry

"
in
this
way
the
two
politician
part
.
  
<EOS>
We
may
as
well
follow
this
political
movement
to
its
end
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
see
Lord
Brock
that
night
,
and
then
those
two
minister
send
for
another
minister
,
 
another
noble
Lord
,
a
man
of
great
experience
in
Cabinets
.
<EOS>
these
three
discuss
the
matter
together
,
and
on
the
follow
day
Lord
Brock
get
up
in
the
House
,
and
make
a
strong
speech
in
defence
of
his
colleague

Mr.
Finespun

<EOS>
to
the
end
of
the
Session
,
at
any
rate

Mr.
Finespun
keep
his
position
,

their

in
the
meantime
Mr.
Palliser
have
return
to
his
wife
,
and
tell
her
of
his
resolution
with
reference
to
their
tour
abroad

some
ten
or
twelve
day
after

to
London
from
Westmoreland
he

at

four
small
slip

the
third

be
come
on

and
money
be
already
be
spend
very
freely
among
the
man
of
the
River
Bank

<EOS>
so
,
at

,
Mr.

declare

<EOS>
Mr.
Grimes
,
of
the
"
Handsome
Man

have
show
sign
of
return
allegiance

but
Mr.
Grimes
could
not
afford
to
be
loyal
without
money

<EOS>
He
have
his
little
family
to
protect
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby

have
his
little
family

and
be
not
ashamed
to
use
it
on
this
occasion

<EOS>
"
I
be
a
family
man
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
and
therefore
I
never
run
any
risk
.
<EOS>
I
never
go
a
yard
further
than
I
can
see
my
way
back

<EOS>
"
this
he
have
say
in
answer
to
a
proposition
that
he
should
take
George
's
note
of
hand
for
the
expense
of
the
next
election
,
payable
in
three
month
"
time

<EOS>
"
It
be
so
very
hard
to
realize
,
"
say
George
,
"
immediately
upon
a
death
,
when
all
the
property
leave
be
real
property
.
"
<EOS>
"
very
hard
indeed
,
"
say
Mr.
Scruby
,
who
have
hear
with
accuracy
all
the
particular
of
the
old
Squire
's
will
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
understand
the
lawyer
,
curse
him
inwardly
,
and
suggest
to
himself
that
some
day
he
may
murder
Mr.
Scruby
as
well
as
John
Grey
,
 
and
perhaps
also
a
few
more
of
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
two
day
after
the
interview
in
which
his
own
note
of

upon
this
occasion
he

the
four
slip

Mr.

regard
them
with
attention
,
look
first
at
one
side
horizontally
,

then
at
the
other
side
perpendicularly

but
before
we
learn
the
judgement
pronounce
by
Mr.
Scruby
as
to
these
four
slip
of
paper
,
we
must
go
back
to
their
early
history

they
be
still

"

<EOS>
what
sort

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
miss

I
do
not

decent

look
at

"
  
<EOS>
Alice
Vavasor
have
no
desire
to
deny
herself
to
any
person
but
one
.
<EOS>
She
be
well
aware
that
the
gentleman
in
the
hall
could
not
be
her
cousin
George
,
and
therefore
she
do
not
refuse
to
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
him
come
up
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
think
,
Jane
,
you
ought
to
ask
him
his
name
.
<EOS>
"
Jane
do
ask
him
his
name
,
and
come
back
immediately
,
announce
Mr.
Levy

<EOS>
this
occur
immediately
after
the
return
of
Mr.
John
Vavasor
from
Westmoreland
.
<EOS>
He
have
reach
home
late
on
the
precede
evening
,
and
at
the
moment

in
his
dressing

room
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
get
up
to
receive
her
visitor
,
and
at
once
understand
the
tone
of
her
maid
's
voice
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Levy
be
certainly
not
a
gentleman
of
the
sort
to
which
she
have
be
most
accustomed
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
little
dark
man
,
with
sharp
eye
,
set
very
near
to
each
other
in
his
head
,
with
a
beak
nose
,
thick
at
the
bridge
,
and
a
black
moustache
,
but
no
other
beard
.
<EOS>
Alice
do
not
at
all
like
the
look
of
Mr.
Levy
,
but
she
stand
up
to
receive
him
,
make
him
a
little
bow
,
and
ask
him
to
sit
down
.
  
<EOS>
"

"
<EOS>
Alice
ask

<EOS>
"
well
,
miss
,
I
do
not
think
he
be
,
 
not
to
say

"
  
<EOS>
Alice
have
think
it
may
be
as
well
that
Mr.
Levy
should
know
that
there
be
a
gentleman
in
the
house
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have

Mr.

when

<EOS>
"
nothing

You

find
it
all

<EOS>
George
Vavasor
's
letter
to
his
cousin
be
as
follow
:
    
<EOS>
dear
alice
,
  
<EOS>
after
what
pass
between
us
when
I
last
see
you
<EOS>
I
think
that
on
my
return
from
Westmoreland
I
should
learn
that
you
have
pay
in
at
my
banker
"
the
money
that
I
require
.
<EOS>
but
I
find
that
this
be
not
so
;
and
of
course
I
excuse
you
,
because
woman
so
seldom
know
when
or
how
to
do
that
which
business
demand
of
them
.
<EOS>
You
have
,
no
doubt
,
hear
the
injustice
which
my
grandfather
have
do
me
,
and
will
probably
feel
as
indignant
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
only
mention
this
now
,
because
the
nature
of
his
will
make
it
more
than
ever
incumbent
on
you
that
you
should
be
true
to
your
pledge
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
till
there
shall
be
some
ground
for
a
well
understanding
between
us
,
 
and
this
I
do
not
doubt
will
come
,
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
wiser
not
to
call
,
myself
,
at
Queen
Anne
Street
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
send
my
confidential
clerk
with
four
bill
,
each
of
five
hundred
pound
,
draw
at
fourteen
day
"
date
,
across
which
I
will
get
you
to
write
your
name
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Levy
will
show
you
the
way
in
which
this
should
be
do
.
<EOS>
Your
name
must
come
under
the
word
"
accept
,
"
and
just
above
the
name
of
Messrs.
Drummonds
,
where
the
money
must
be
lie
ready
,
at
any
rate
,
not
later
than
Monday
fortnight
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
money
must
be
there
some
time
on
the
Saturday
.
<EOS>
They
know
you
so
well
at
Drummonds
"
that
you
will
not
object
to
call
on
the
Saturday
afternoon
,
and
ask
if
it
be
all
right
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
certainly
be
inconvenience
by
not
find
the
money
as
I
expect
on
my
return
to
town
.
<EOS>
if
these
bill
be
not
properly
provide
for
,
the
result
will
be
very
disastrous
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
feel
,
however
,
sure
that
this
will
be
do
,
both
for
your
own
sake
and
for
mine
.
  
<EOS>
affectionately
yours
,
  
GEORGE
VAVASOR
.
  
<EOS>
the
unparalleled
impudence
of
this
letter
have
the
effect
which
the
writer
have
intend
.
<EOS>
It
make
Alice
think
immediately
of
her
own
remissness
,
 
if
she
have
be
remiss
,
 
rather
than
of
the
enormity
of
his
claim
upon
her
.
<EOS>
the
decision
with
which
he
ask
for
her
money
,
without
any
pretence
at
an
excuse
on
his
part
,
do
for
the
time
induce
her
to
believe
that
she
have
no
alternative
but
to
give
it
to
him
,
and
that
she
have
be
wrong
in
delay
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
tell
him
that
he
should
have
it
,
and
she
ought
to
have
be
as
good
as
her
word
.
<EOS>
She
should
not
have
force
upon
him
the
necessity
of
demand
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
idea
of
sign
four
bill
be
terrible
to
her
,
and
she
feel
sure
that
she
ought
not
to
put
her
name
to
order
for
so
large
an
amount
and
then
intrust
them
to
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Levy
.
<EOS>
Her
father
be
in
the
house
,
and
she
may
have
ask
him
.
<EOS>
the
thought
that
she
would
do
so
of
course
occur
to
her
.
<EOS>
but
then
it
occur
to
her
also
that
be
she
to
speak
to
her
father
as
to
this
advancing
of
money
to
her
cousin
,
 
to
this
giving
of
money
,
<EOS>
for
she
now
well
understand
that
it
would
be
a
gift
;
 
be
she
to
consult
her
father
in
any
way
about
it
,
he
would
hinder
her
,
not
only
from
sign
the
bill
for
Mr.
Levy
,
but
,
as
far
as
he
could
do
so
,
from
keep
the
promise
make
to
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
She
be
resolve
that
George
should
have
the
money
,
and
she
know
that
she
could
give
it
to
him
in
spite
of
her
father
.
<EOS>
but
her
father
may
probably
be
able
to
delay
the
gift
,
and
thus
rob
it
of
its
chief
value
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
to
sign
the
bill
,
the
money
must
be
make
to
be
forthcoming
.
<EOS>
so
much
she
understand
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Levy
have
take
out
the
four
bill
from
the
same
case
,
and
have
place
them
on
the
table
before
him
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
have
explain
,
I
believe
,
miss
,
<EOS>
what
it
be
you
have
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
he
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
;
my
cousin
have
explain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
there
be
nothing
else
to
trouble
you
with
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
just
write
your
name
across
them
,
here
,
I
need
not
detain
you
by
stay
any
longer
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Levy
be
very
anxious
to
make
his
visit
as
short
as
possible
,
since
he
have
hear
that
Mr.
John
Vavasor
be
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
but
Alice
hesitate
.
<EOS>
two
thousand
pound
be
a
very
serious
sum
of
money
.
<EOS>
She
have
hear
much
of
sharper
,
and
think
that
she
ought
to
be
cautious
.
<EOS>
what
if
this
man
,
of
whom
she
have
never
before
hear
,
should
steal
the
bill
after
she
have
sign
them
?
<EOS>
She
look
again
at
her
cousin
's
letter
,
chiefly
with
the
object
of
gain
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
right
,
miss
,
"
say
Mr.
Levy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Could
you
not
leave
them
with
me
,
sir
?
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
;
not
very
well
,
miss
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
Mr.
Vavasor
have
explain
it
all
;
but
the
fact
be
,
he
must
have
them
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
He
have
get
a
heavy
sum
to
put
down
on
the
nail
about
this
here
election
,
and
if
it
be
not
down
to
-
day
,
them
on
whom
he
have
to
depend
will
be
all
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
sir
,
the
money
will
not
be
payable
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
if
I
understand
it
,
they
be
not
cheque
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
miss
,
no
;
they
be
not
cheque
.
<EOS>
but
your
name
,
miss
,
at
fourteen
day
,
be
the
same
as
ready
money
;
 
just
the
same
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
pause
,
and
while
she
pause
,
he
reach
a
pen
for
her
from
the
writing
-
table
,
and
then
she
sign
the
four
bill
as
he
hold
them
before
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
quick
enough
at
do
this
when
she
have
once
commence
the
work
.
<EOS>
Her
object
,
then
,
be
that
the
man
should
be
go
from
the
house
before
her
father
could
meet
him
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
the
four
bit
of
paper
which
George
Vavasor
tender
to
Mr.
Scruby
's
notice
on
the
occasion
which
we
have
now
in
hand
.
<EOS>
in
do
so
,
he
make
use
of
them
after
the
manner
of
a
grand
capitalist
,
who
know
that
he
may
assume
certain
air
as
he
allow
the
odour
of
the
sweetness
of
his
wealth
to
drop
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
insist
on
ready
money
,
with
your
d
 
---
suspicion
,
"
say
he
;
"
and
there
it
be
.
<EOS>
You
be
not
afraid
of
fourteen
day
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
fourteen
day
be
neither
here
nor
there
,
"
say
Mr.
Scruby
.
<EOS>
"
We
can
let
our
payment
stand
over
as
long
as
that
,
without
do
any
harm
.
<EOS>
I
will
send
one
of
my
man
down
to
Grimes
,
and
tell
him
I
can
not
see
him
,
till
,
 
<EOS>
let
me
see
,
"
and
he
look
at
one
of
the
bill
,
"
till
the
15th
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
exactly
what
George
Vavasor
want
.
<EOS>
He
be
desirous
that
the
bill
should
be
immediately
turn
into
money
,
so
that
the
necessity
of
force
payment
from
Alice
,
should
due
provision
for
the
bill
not
be
make
,
may
fall
into
other
hand
than
his
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
wait
till
the
15th
,
"
say
Scruby
,
as
he
hand
the
bit
of
paper
back
to
his
customer
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
want
a
thousand
,
you
say
?
"
say
George
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
thousand
to
begin
with
.
<EOS>
certainly
not
less
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
have
better
keep
two
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
 
no
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
the
use
of
that
.
<EOS>
You
have
better
collect
them
through
your
own
banker
,
and
let
me
have
a
cheque
on
the
15th
or
16th
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
cursed
suspicious
you
be
,
Scruby
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
be
not
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
a
bit
suspicious
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
deal
in
such
article
;
that
be
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
doubt
can
there
be
about
such
bill
as
those
?
<EOS>
everybody
know
that
my
cousin
have
a
considerable
fortune
,
altogether
at
her
own
disposal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
truth
be
,
Mr.
Vavasor
,
that
bill
with
lady
"
name
on
them
,
 
lady
who
be
no
way
connect
with
business
,
 
be
not
just
the
paper
that
people
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
on
earth
can
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
take
them
into
the
City
for
discount
,
and
see
if
the
banker
do
not
tell
you
the
same
.
<EOS>
They
may
be
do
,
of
course
,
upon
your
name
.
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
about
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
explain
to
you
the
nature
of
the
family
arrangement
,
but
I
can
not
do
that
to
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
do
not
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
not
.
<EOS>
the
time
be
so
short
that
it
do
not
signify
.
<EOS>
have
them
collect
through
your
own
banker
,
and
then
,
if
it
do
not
suit
you
to
call
,
send
me
a
cheque
for
a
thousand
pound
when
the
time
be
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Scruby
turn
to
some
paper
on
his
right
hand
,
as
though
the
interview
have
be
long
enough
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
look
at
him
angrily
,
open
his
wound
at
him
and
curse
him
inwardly
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
go
on
with
his
paper
,
by
no
mean
regard
either
the
wound
or
the
unspoken
curse
.
<EOS>
thereupon
Vavasor
get
up
and
go
away
without
any
word
of
farewell
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
walk
along
Great
Marlborough
Street
,
and
through
those
unalluring
street
which
surround
the
Soho
district
,
and
so
on
to
the
Strand
and
his
own
lodging
,
he
still
continue
to
think
of
some
wide
scheme
of
revenge
,
 
of
some
scheme
in
which
Mr.
Scruby
may
be
include
.
<EOS>
there
have
appear
something
latterly
in
Mr.
Scruby
's
manner
to
him
,
something
of
mingled
impatience
and
familiarity
,
which
make
him
feel
that
he
have
fall
in
the
attorney
's
estimation
.

It
be
not
that
the
lawyer
think
him
to
be
less
honourable
,
or
less
clever
,
than
he
have
before
think
him
;
but
that
the
man
be
like
a
rat
,
and
know
a
fall
house
by
the
instinct
that
be
in
him
.
<EOS>
so
George
Vavasor
curse
Mr.
Scruby
,
and
calculate
some
method
of
murder
him
without
detection
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
be
not
to
suppose
that
the
Member
for
the
Chelsea
Districts
have
,
in
truth
,
resolve
to
gratify
his
revenge
by
murder
,
 
by
murder
any
of
those
person
whom
he
hate
so
vigorously
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
,
himself
,
think
it
probable
that
he
would
become
a
murderer
.
<EOS>
but
he
receive
some
secret
satisfaction
in
allow
his
mind
to
dwell
upon
the
subject
,
and
in
make
those
calculation
.
<EOS>
He
reflect
that
it
would
not
do
to
take
off
Scruby
and
John
Grey
at
the
same
time
,
as
it
would
be
know
that
he
be
connect
with
both
of
them
;
unless
,
indeed
,
he
be
to
take
off
a
third
person
at
the
same
time
,
 
a
third
person
,
as
to
the
expediency
of
end
whose
career
he
make
his
calculation
quite
as
often
as
he
do
in
regard
to
any
of
those
person
whom
he
curse
so
often
.
<EOS>
It
need
hardly
be
explain
to
the
reader
that
this
third
person
be
the
sit
Member
for
the
Chelsea
Districts
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
be
himself
in
want
of
instant
ready
money
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
's
proposition
that
he
should
leave
the
four
bill
at
his
own
banker
"
,
to
be
collect
when
they
come
to
maturity
,
do
not
suit
him
.
<EOS>
He
doubt
much
,
also
,
whether
at
the
end
of
the
fourteen
day
the
money
would
be
forthcoming
.
<EOS>
Alice
would
be
drive
to
tell
her
father
,
in
order
that
the
money
may
be
procure
,
and
John
Vavasor
would
probably
succeed
in
put
impediment
in
the
way
of
the
payment
.
<EOS>
He
must
take
the
bill
into
the
City
,
and
do
the
good
there
that
he
could
with
them
.
<EOS>
He
be
too
late
for
this
to
-
day
,
and
therefore
he
go
to
his
lodging
,
and
then
down
to
the
House
.
<EOS>
in
the
House
he
sit
all
the
night
with
his
hat
over
his
eye

make
those
little
calculation
of
which
I

"

<EOS>
George
Vavasor
be
in
the

time
the
next
morning
,
but
he
find
that
the
City
do
not
look
with
favourable
eye
on
his
four
bill
.
<EOS>
the
City
take
them
up
,
first
horizontally
,
and
then
,
with
a
twist
of
its
hand
,
perpendicularly
,
and
look
at
them
with
distrustful
eye
.
<EOS>
the
City
repeat
the

,
Alice
Vavasor

as
though
it
be
not
esteem
a

<EOS>
the
City
suggest
that
as
the
time
be
so
short
,
the
holder
of
the
bill
would
be
wise
to
hold
them
till
he
could
collect
the
amount
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
clear
that
the
City
suspect
something
wrong
in
the
transaction
.
<EOS>
the
City
,
by
one
of
its
mouth
,
assert
plainly
that
lady
"
bill
never
mean
business
.
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
curse
the
city
,
and
make
his
calculation
about
murder
it
.
<EOS>
may
not
a
river
of
strychnine
be
turn
on
round
the
Exchange
about
luncheon
time

<EOS>
three
of
the

he
leave
at

with
his
own

for
collection
,

retain
the
fourth
in

intend
on

those
low
depth
of
the

<EOS>
again
,
on
the
next
day
,
he
go
to
work

succeed
to
some
extent

among

low
depth
he
find
a
capitalist
who
be
willing
to
advance
him
two
hundred

keep
that
fourth
bill

the
capitalist
be
to
have
forty
pound
for
the
transaction

and
George
curse
him
as
he
take
his
cheque

<EOS>
George
Vavasor
know
quite
enough
of
the

enable
him
to
understand
that
a

forty

I
have
sign

<EOS>
still
Mr.

make
no

<EOS>
"
Papa
,
if
you

Your

<EOS>
then
there
be
a
pause
for
a
moment
in
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
I
never
hear
of
such
a
thing
in

say
Mr.

"
I
never

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You

so
often
over

"
<EOS>
this
be
very
cruel
.
<EOS>
perhaps
she
have
deserve
the
reproach
,
but
still
it
be
very
cruel
.
<EOS>
the
blow
strike
her
with
such
force
that
she
stagger
under
it

<EOS>
tear
come
into
her

she
could
hardly

she
should
betray
herself
by
sob

<EOS>
"
I
know
that
I

"
I
must
go

myself

on

about
the
room

jingle
the
money
in
his
trouser
-
pocket

and
push
the
chair
about
as
he
chance
to
meet
them
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
he
make
a
compromise
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
would
take
a
day
to
think
whether
he
would
assist
her
in
get
the
money
,
and
communicate
his
decision
to
her
on
the
follow
morning
.
   
<EOS>
the
bill
be
make
all
right

<EOS>
Mr.

be
at
his

end
about
his
daughter

<EOS>
She
have
put
her
name
to
four
bill
for
five
hundred
pound
each
,
and
have
demand
from
him
,
almost
without
an
apology
,
his
aid
in
obtain
money
to
meet
them
.
<EOS>
and
she
may
put
her
name
to
any
other
number
of
bill
,
and
for
any
amount
!
<EOS>
there
be
no
know
how
a
man
ought
to
behave
to
such
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
her
money
,
"
the
father
say
to
himself
;
"
and
if
she
have
get
none
of
her
own
,
I
would
make
her
as
comfortable
as
I
could
with
my
own
income
.
<EOS>
but
to
see
her
throw
her
money
away
in
such
a
fashion
as
this
be
enough
to
break
a
man
's
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
go
to
his
office
in
Chancery
Lane
,
but
he
do
not
go
to
the
chamber
of
Mr.
Round
,
the
lawyer
.
<EOS>
instead
of
call
on
Mr.
Round
he
send
a
note
by
a
messenger
to
Suffolk
Street
,
and
the
answer
to
the
note
come
in
the
person
of
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
John
Grey
be
live
in
town
in
these
day
,
and
be
in
the
habit
of
see
Mr.
Vavasor
frequently
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
have
not
leave
London
since
the
memorable
occasion
on
which
he
have
pitch
his
rival
down
the
tailor
's
stair
at
his
lodging
.
<EOS>
He
have
make
himself
pretty
well
conversant
with
George
Vavasor
's
career
,
and
have
often
shudder
as
he
think
what
may
be
the
fate
of
any
girl
who
may
trust
herself
to
marry
such
a
man
as
that
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
be
at
home
when
Mr.
Vavasor
's
note
have
reach
his
lodging
,
and
have
instantly
walk
off
towards
Chancery
Lane
.
<EOS>
He
know
his
way
to
Mr.
Vavasor
's
signing
-
office
very
accurately
,
for
he
have
acquire
a
habit
of
call
there
,
and
of
talk
to
the
father
about
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
patient
,
persevere
man
,
confident
in
himself
,
and
apt
to
trust
that
he
would
accomplish
those
thing
which
he
attempt
,
though
he
be
hardly
himself
aware
of
any
such
aptitude
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
despair
as
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
and
though
he
have
openly
acknowledge
to
himself
that
she
have
be
very
foolish
,
 
or
rather
,
that
her
judgement
have
fail
her
,
 
he
have
never
in
truth
be
angry
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
look
upon
her
rejection
of
himself
,
and
her
subsequent
promise
to
her
cousin
,
as
the
effect
of
a
mental
hallucination
,
very
much
to
be
lament
,
 
to
be
weep
for
,
perhaps
,
through
a
whole
life
,
as
a
source
of
terrible
sorrow
to
himself
and
to
her
.
<EOS>
but
he
regard
it
all
as
a
disease
,
of
which
the
cure
be
yet
possible
,
 
as
a
disease
which
,
though
it
may
never
leave
the
patient
as
strong
as
she
be
before
,
may
still
leave
her
altogether
.
<EOS>
and
as
he
would
still
have
cling
to
his
love
have
she
be
attack
by
any
of
those
illness
for
which
doctor
have
well
-
know
name
,
so
would
he
cling
to
her
now
that
she
be
attack
by
a
malady
for
which
no
name
be
know
.
<EOS>
He
have
already
hear
from
Mr.
Vavasor
that
Alice
have
discover
how
impossible
it
be
that
she
should
marry
her
cousin
,
and
,
in
his
quiet
,
patient
,
endure
way
,
be
begin
to
feel
confident
that
he
would
,
at
last
,
carry
his
mistress
off
with
him
to
Nethercoats
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
a
melancholy
place
,
that
signing
-
office
,
in
which
Mr.
John
Vavasor
be
doom
to
spend
twelve
hour
a
week
,
during
every
term
time
,
of
his
existence
.
<EOS>
whether
any
man
could
really
pass
an
existence
of
work
in
such
a
workshop
,
and
not
have
go
mad
,
 
could
have
endure
to
work
there
for
seven
hour
a
day
,
every
week
-
day
of
his
life
,
I
be
not
prepared
to
say
.
<EOS>

without

any
slight
tick

I

that
Lord

mercifully

that
the

somewhat

with

<EOS>
the
building
in

Mr.

a

be
locate

of

side

in

be

<EOS>
It

very
ugly
,
have
about
it
that
air
of
importance
which
justify
a

assume
a
special
name
of
itself
.
<EOS>
this
building
be
call
the
Accountant

General

Record
Office
,
and
very
probably
,
in
the
gloom
of
its
dark
cellar
,
may
lie
to
this
day
the
record
of
the
expenditure
of
many
a
fair
property
which
have
get
itself
into
Chancery
,
and
have
never
get
itself
out
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
enter
by
a
dark
hall
,
the
door
of
which
be
never
close
;
and
which
,
have
another
door
at
its
further
end
lead
into
another
lane
,
have
become
itself
a
thoroughfare
.
<EOS>
but
the
passer
through
it
be
few
in
number
.
<EOS>
now
and
then
a
boy
may
be
see
there
carry
on
his
head
or
shoulder
a
huge
mass
of
paper
which
you
would
presume
to
be
account
,
or
some
clerk
employ
in
the
purlieu
of
Chancery
Lane
who
would
know
the
short
possible
way
from
the
chamber
of
some
one
attorney
to
those
of
some
other
.
<EOS>
but
this
hall
,
though
open
at
both
end
,
be
as
dark
as
Erebus
;
and
any
who
linger
in
it
would
soon
find
themselves
to
be
grow
damp
,
and
would
smell
mildew
,
and
would
become
naturally
affect
by
the
exhalation
arise
from
those
chancery
record
beneath
their
foot
.
  
<EOS>
up
the
stone
stair
,
from
this
hall
,
John
Grey
pass
to
Mr.
Vavasor
's
signing
-
room
.
<EOS>
the
stair
be
broad
,
and
almost
of
noble
proportion
,
but
the
darkness
and
gloom
which
hang
about
the
hall
,
hang
also
about
them
,
 
a
melancholy
set
of
stair
,
up
and
down
which
no
man
can
walk
with
cheerful
foot
.
<EOS>
here
he
come
upon
a
long
,
broad
passage
,
in
which
no
sound
be
,
at
first
,
to
be
hear
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
busy
noise
of
door
slam
,
no
rapid
sound
of
shoe
,
no
passing
to
and
fro
of
man
intent
on
their
daily
bread
.
<EOS>
pause
for
a
moment
,
that
he
may
look
round
about
him
and
realize
the
deathlike
stillness
of
the
whole
,
John
Grey
could
just
distinguish
the
heavy
breathing
of
a
man
,
thereby
learn
that
there
be
a
captive
in
,
at
any
rate
,
one
of
those
prison
on
each
side
of
him
.
<EOS>
as
he
draw
near
to
the
door
of
Mr.
Vavasor
's
chamber
he
know
that
the
breathing
come
from
thence
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
door
there
be
word
inscribe
,
which
be
just
legible
in
the
gloom
 
"
Signing
Room
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
how
John
Vavasor
do
hate
those
word
!
<EOS>
It
seem
to
him
that
they
have
be
place
there
with
the
express
object
of
declare
his
degradation
aloud
to
the
world
.
<EOS>
since
his
grandfather
's
will
have
be
read
to
him
he
have
almost
make
up
his
mind
to
go
down
those
melancholy
stair
for
the
last
time
,
to
shake
the
dust
off
his
foot
as
he
leave
the
Accountant
-
General
's
Record
Office
for
ever
,
and
content
himself
with
half
his
official
income
.
<EOS>
but
how
could
he
give
up
so
many
hundred
a
year
while
his
daughter
be
persist
in
throw
away
thousand
as
fast
as
,
or
faster
than
<EOS>
,
she
could
lay
her
hand
on
them
?
  
<EOS>
John
Grey
enter
the
room
and
find
Mr.
Vavasor
sit
all
alone
in
an
arm
-
chair
over
the
fire
.
<EOS>
I
rather
think
that
that
breathing
have
be
the
breathing
of
a
man
asleep
.
<EOS>
He
be
rest
himself
amidst
the
labour
of
his
signing
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
large
,
dull
room
,
which
could
not
have
be
paint
,
I
should
think
,
within
the
memory
of
man
,
look
out
backwards
into
some
court
.
<EOS>
the
black
wall
of
another
building
seem
to
stand
up
close
to
the
window
,
 
so
close
that
no
direct
ray
of
the
sun
ever
interrupt
the
signing

clerk
at
his
work
.
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
the
room
there
be
a
large
mahogany
-
table
,
on
which
lie
a
pile
of
huge
paper
.
<EOS>
across
the
top
of
them
there
be
place
a
bit
of
blotting
-
paper
,
with
a
quill
pen
,
the
two
only
tool
which
be
necessary
to
the
performance
of
the
signing
-
clerk
's
work
.
<EOS>
on
the
table
there
stand
a
row
of
official
book
,
place
lengthway
on
their
edge
:
the
"
Post
-
Office
Directory
,
"
the
"
Court
Circular
,
"
a
"
directory
to
the
Inns
of
Court
,
"
a
dusty
volume
of
Acts
of
Parliament
,
which
have
reference
to
chancery
account
,
 
a
volume
which
Mr.
Vavasor
never
open
;
and
there
be
some
other
;
but
there
be
no
book
there
in
which
any
christian
man
or
woman
could
take
delight
,
either
for
amusement
or
for
recreation
.
<EOS>
there
be
<EOS>
three
or
four
chair
round
the
wall
,
and
there
be
the
one
arm
-
chair
which
the
occupant
of
the
chamber
have
drag
away
from
its
sacred
place
to
the
hearth

rug
.
<EOS>
there
be
also
an
old
Turkey
carpet
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
other
furniture
there
be
none

<EOS>
Can
it
be
a
matter
of
surprise
to
any
one
that
Mr.
Vavasor
prefer
his
club
to
his
place
of
business
?
<EOS>
He
be
not
leave
quite
alone
in
this
deathlike
dungeon
.
<EOS>
attach
to
his
own
large
room
there
be
a
small
closet
,
in
which
sit
the
signing

a
lad
of
perhaps
seventeen

<EOS>
have
I
be
Mr.

<EOS>
I
should
have
swear
a

have
tell

join
his
youthful

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
Mr.

cry

It

It

cold

<EOS>
"
how

<EOS>
"
I
be
not
quite
sure
that
you

Grey

though
of

you
ought
to
do
so
better

"
  
<EOS>
"
nobody
can

the
angry

<EOS>
as
he
ask
the
question
there
come
a
red
spot
on
each
cheek
,
show
the
strong
mental
anxiety
which
have
prompt
it

<EOS>
"
no

I
believe
not

that

certainly
not
in
the

I
think
that

would
you
believe
it

she
have
give
him
her

at
two

He
send
to
her
only
this

be
fool
enough

such

<EOS>
the
shortness
of
the
date
at
which
the
bill
be
draw
seem
to
afflict
Mr.
Vavasor
almost
as
keenly
as
the
amount

then
he
describe

Grey

upon
my
word

I
do
not

My
belief

never

married

She
will
never
do
anything
like
any
other
woman

the
money
will
not
be
miss
by
me

Grey

a
smile

I
shall
make
her
pay

no

if

would
know
that
she

not
take

I
know
it

I
be
only

as
soon

I

certain

finally
certain

will
take

You

not

have
make

then
be
explain
to
her

follow
morning
the

the

do

abroad

He

Mr.

that
she
would

in
Park
Lane

<EOS>
Alice

They

Monk

I
sometimes

they
be
the
most
proper

reasonable

in

two

when
I
have

so
very
respectable

my
youth

of
course
you
will
understand
that
my
husband
be
to
take
us
.

<EOS>
"
but
Mr.

can
not
leave
London
at
this
time
of
the
year
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
just
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
leave
London
at
this
time
of
the
year

<EOS>
do
not
look
in
that
way
,
for
it
be
all
settle
.
<EOS>
whether
you
go
with
me

not
,
I
have
get
to
go
.
<EOS>
to
-
day
be
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
We
be
to
be
off
next
Tuesday
night
,
if
you
can
make
yourself
ready
.
<EOS>
We
shall
breakfast
in
Paris
on
Wednesday
morning
,
and
then
it
will
be
to
us
all
just
as
if
we
be
in
a
new
world
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
will
walk
up
and
down
the
new
court
of
the
Louvre
,

you
will
be
on
his
left
arm
,
and
I
shall
be
on
his
right
,
 
just
like
english
people
,
 
and
it
will
be
the
most
proper
thing
that
ever
be
see
in
life
.
<EOS>
then
we
shall
go
on
to
Basle
<EOS>
"
 
Alice
shudder
as
Basle
be
mention
,
think
of
the
balcony
over
the
river
 
"
and
so
to
Lucerne
 
.
<EOS>
but
no
;
that
be
the
first
plan
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
alter
it
.
<EOS>
He
spend
a
whole
day
up
here
with
map
and
Bradshaw
's
and
Murray
's
guide
-
book
,
and
he
scold
me
so
because
I
do
not
care
whether
we
go
first
to
Baden
or
to
some
other
place
.
<EOS>
how
could
I
care
?
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
would
go
anywhere
<EOS>
he
choose
to
take
me
.
<EOS>
then
he
tell
me
I
be
heartless
;
 
and
I
acknowledge
that
I
be
heartless
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
heartless
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
tell
me
something
I
do
not
know
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Cora
,
why
do
you
say
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
choose
to
contradict
my
husband
.
<EOS>
besides
,
it
be
true
.
<EOS>
then
he
throw
the
Bradshaw
away
,
and
all
the
map
fly
about
.
<EOS>
so
I
pick
them
up
again
,
and
say
we
would
go
to
Switzerland
first
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
would
settle
it
,
and
of
course
he
decide
on
stop
at
Baden
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
say
Jericho
,
it
would
have
be
the
same
thing
to
me
.
<EOS>
Would
not
you
like
to
go
to
Jericho
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
no
special
objection
to
Jericho
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
be
to
go
to
Baden
instead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
say
nothing
about
that
yet
.
<EOS>
but
you
have
not
tell
me
half
your
story
.
<EOS>
why
be
Mr.
Palliser
go
abroad
in
the
middle
of
Parliament
in
this
way
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
;
now
I
must
go
back
to
the
beginning
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
,
Alice
,
I
hardly
know
how
to
tell
you
;
not
that
I
mind
you
know
it
,
only
there
be
some
thing
that
will
not
get
themselves
tell
.
<EOS>
You
can
hardly
guess
what
it
be
that
he
be
give
up
.
<EOS>
You
must
swear
that
you
will
not
repeat
what
I
be
go
to
tell
you
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
a
person
apt
to
tell
secret
,

I
shall
not
swear
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
woman
you
be
for
discretion
!
<EOS>
it
be
you
that
ought
to
be
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
;
you
be
so
wise
.
<EOS>
only
you
have
not
bring
your
own
pig
to
the
good
market
,
after
all
.

<EOS>
"
never
mind
my
own
pig
now
,
Cora
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
mind
them
,
very
much
.
<EOS>
but
the
secret
be
this
.
<EOS>
They
have
ask
Mr.
Palliser
to
be
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
and
he
have
 
refuse
.
<EOS>
think
of
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
because
of
me
,
 
of
me
,
and
my
folly
,
and
wickedness
,
and
abomination
.
<EOS>
because
he
have
be
fool
enough
to
plague
himself
with
a
wife
 
he
who
of
all
man
ought
to
have
keep
himself
free
from
such
trouble
.
<EOS>
oh
,
he
have
be
so
good
!
<EOS>
It
be
almost
impossible
to
make
any
one
understand
it
.
<EOS>
if
you
could
know
how
he
have
long
for
this
office
;
 
how
he
have
work
for
it
day
and
night
,
wear
his
eye
out
with
figure
when
everybody
else
have
be
asleep
,
shut
himself
up
with
such
creature
as
Mr.
Bott
when
other
man
have
be
shoot
and
hunting
and
flirt
and
spend
their
money
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
a
slave
to
it
for
year
,
 
all
his
life
I
believe
,
 
in
order
that
he
may
sit
in
the
Cabinet
,
and
be
a
minister
and
a
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
<EOS>
He
have
hope
and
fear
,
and
have
be
,
I
believe
,
sometimes
half
-
mad
with
expectation
.
<EOS>
this
have
be
his
excitement
,
 
what
racing
and
gambling
be
to
other
man
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
the
place
be
there
,
ready
for
him
,
and
they
offer
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
They
beg
him
to
take
it
,
almost
on
their
knee
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
be
here
all
one
morning
about
it
;
but
Mr.
Palliser
send
him
away
,
and
refuse
the
place
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
over
now
,
and
the
other
man
,
whom
they
all
hate
so
much
,
be
to
remain
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
do
he
refuse
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
keep
on
tell
you
 
because
of
me
.
<EOS>
He
find
that
I
want
look
after
,
and
that
Mrs.
Marsham

Mr.
Bott
between
them
could
not
do
it

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Cora

<EOS>
how
can
you
talk
in
that
way
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
know
all
,
you
may
well
ask

I
could

<EOS>
You
remember
about
Lady
Monk
's
ball
,
that
you
would
not
go
to
,
 
as
you
ought
to
have
do
.

if
you
have
go
,
Mr.

would
have
be
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
at
this
minute
;
he
would
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
only
think
of
that
!
<EOS>
but
though
you
do
not
go
,
other
people
do
who
ought
to
have
remain
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
go
for
one
,
 
<EOS>
and
you
know
who
be
there
for
another

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
difference
could
that
make
to
you
?

say
Alice
,
angrily

It
may
have
make
a
great
deal
of
difference

,
for
the
matter
of
that
,
so
it
do
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
be
there
too

,
of
course
,
he
go
away
immediately

I
can
not

you
all
the
trouble
there
have
be
about
Mrs.
Marsham

whether
I
be
to
take
her
with
me

not

I
would
not

her

do
not
take
her

the
carriage
go
for
her
first

there
she
be
when
we
get
there

Mr.

there
too

wonder
whether
I

ever
make
you
understand
it
all

there
be
some
thing
I

there
they
both
be

me

look
at
me
the
whole

I
resolve
that
I

put
down

I
think

It

everybody
there

I
feel
myself
to
be
desperate

mad
,
like
a
wild
woman

there
I
be
,
go
round

round

round
with
the
only
man

I
ever
care
two
straws

It
seem
as

everything
have
be
a
dream

the
old
day

<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
how
well
I
remember
the
first
time
I
dance
with
him
,
 
at
his
aunt
's
house
in
Cavendish
Square
.
<EOS>
They
have
only
just
bring
me
out
in
London
then

I
think
that
he
be
a
god

I
know
well
enough
that
he
be
no
god
now

some
people
say
that
he
be
a
devil
,

he
be
like
Apollo
to
me

you
ever

so
beautiful

no

do

run
after

when

him
the

half
wild

catch
him

just

up
my

what

go
with

ask

a

that

it
would
have
be
my
own
destruction

<EOS>
I
be
not
such
a
fool
as
not
to
know
that
.
<EOS>
do
you
suppose
I
have
never
think
of
it
;
 
what
it
would
be
to
be
a
man
's
mistress
instead
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
not
I
should
be
a
thing
to
be
hate
and
despise
.
<EOS>
when
once
I
have
do
it
I
should
hate
and
despise
myself
.
<EOS>
I
should
feel
myself
to
be
loathsome
,
and
,
as
it
be
,
a
beast
among
woman
.
<EOS>
but
why
do
they
not
let
me
marry
him
,
instead
of
drive
me
to
this
?
<EOS>
and
though
I
may
have
destroy
myself
,
I
should
have
save
the
man
who
be
still
my
husband
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
I
tell
him
all
that
,
 
tell
him
that
if
I
have
go
away
with
Burgo
Fitzgerald
he
would
have
another
wife
,
and
would
have
child
,
and
would
 
?

<EOS>
"
You
tell
your
husband
that
you
have
think
of
leave
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
I
tell
him
everything
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
that
I
dearly
love
that
poor
fellow
,
for
whom
,
as
I
believe
,
nobody
else
on
earth
care
a
single
straw
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
do
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
you
what
he
say
,
only
that
we
be
all
to
go
to
Baden
together
,
and
then
to
Italy
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
seem
a
bit
angry
;
he
very
seldom
be
angry
,
unless
at
some
trumpery
thing
,
as
when
he
throw
the
book
away
.
<EOS>
and
when
I
tell
him
that
he
may
have
another
wife
and
a
child
,
he
put
his
arm
round
me
and
whisper
to
me
that
he
do
not
care
so
much
about
it
as
I
have
imagine
.
<EOS>
I
feel
more
like
love
him
at
that
moment
than
I
have
ever
do
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
must
be
fit
to
be
an
angel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
fit
to
be
a
cabinet
minister
,
<EOS>
which
,
I
be
quite
sure
,
he
would
like
much
better
.
<EOS>
and
now
you
know
everything
;
but
no
,
 
there
be
one
thing
you
do
not
know
yet
.
<EOS>
when
I
tell
you
that
,
you
will
want
to
make
him
an
archangel
or
a
prime
minister
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
go
abroad
,
"
he
say
,
 
and
remember
,
this
be
his
own
proposition
,
make
long
before
I
be
able
to
speak
a
word
;
 
"
We
will
go
abroad
,
and
you
shall
get
your
cousin
Alice
to
go
with
us
.
"
<EOS>
that
touch
me
more
than
anything
.
<EOS>
only
think
if
he
have
propose
Mrs.
Marsham
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
yet
he
do
not
like
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
wrong
there
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
no
question
of
like
or
of
disliking
.
<EOS>
He
think
you
would
be
a
kind
of
Mrs.
Marsham
,
and
when
you
be
not
,
but
go
out
flirt
among
the
ruin
with
Jeffrey
Palliser
,
instead
 
"
  
"
I
never
go
out
flirt
with
Jeffrey
Palliser
.
"
  
"
He
do
with
you
,
which
be
all
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
and
when
Plantagenet
know
of
that
,
 
for
,
of
course
,
Mr.
Bott
tell
him
 
"
  
"
Mr.
Bott
can
not
see
everything
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
those
man
do
.
<EOS>
the
bad
be
,
they
see
more
than
everything
.
<EOS>
but
,
at
any
rate
,
Mr.
Palliser
have
get
over
all
that
now
.
<EOS>
come
,
Alice
;
the
fact
of
the
offer
have
come
from
himself
should
disarm
you
of
any
such
objection
as
that
.
<EOS>
as
he
have
hold
out
his
hand
to
you
,
you
have
no
alternative
but
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
his
hand
willingly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
for
my
sake
you
will
go
with
us
?
<EOS>
He
understand
himself
that
I
be
not
fit
to
be
his
companion
,
and
to
have
no
companion
but
him
.
<EOS>
now
there
be
a
spirit
of
wisdom
about
you
that
will
do
for
him
,
and
a
spirit
of
folly
that
will
suit
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
manage
to
put
myself
on
a
par
with
a
girl
who
have
play
such
a
wild
game
with
her
lover
as
you
have
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
would
give
no
promise
then
.
<EOS>
Her
first
objection
be
that
she
have
undertake
to
go
down
to
Westmoreland
and
comfort
Kate
in
the
affliction
of
her
broken
arm
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
must
go
,
"
say
Alice
,
remember
how
necessary
it
be
that
she
should
plead
her
own
cause
with
George
Vavasor
's
sister
.
<EOS>
but
she
acknowledge
that
she
have
not
intend
to
stay
long
in
Westmoreland
,
probably
not
more
than
a
week
,
and
it
be
at
last
decide
that
the
Pallisers
should
postpone
their
journey
for
four
or
five
day
,
and
that
Alice
should
go
with
them
immediately
upon
her
return
from
Vavasor
Hall
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
objection
;
"
say
her
father
,
speak
with
that
voice
of
resignation
which
man
use
when
they
be
resolve
to
consider
themselves
injure
whatever
may
be
do
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
get
along
in
lodging
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
have
better
leave
the
house
,
as
you
have
give
away
so
much
of
your
own
fortune
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
do
not
think
it
worth
her
while
to
point
out
to
him
,
in
answer
to
this
,
that
her
contribution
to
their
joint
housekeeping
should
still
remain
the
same
as
ever
.
<EOS>
such
,
however
,
she
know
would
be
the
fact
,
and
she
know
also
that
she
would
find
her
father
in
the
old
house
when
she
return
from
her
travel
.
<EOS>
to
her
,
in
her
own
great
trouble
,
the
absence
from
London
would
be
as
serviceable
as
it
could
be
to
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
have
already
begin
to
feel
the
impossibility
of
stay
quietly
at
home
.
<EOS>
She
could
lecture
her
cousin
,
whose
fault
be
open
,
easy
to
be
define
,
and
almost
loud
in
their
nature
;
but
she
be
not
on
that
account
the
less
aware
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
she
too
have
cause
to
be
ashamed
of
herself
.
<EOS>
She
be
half
afraid
to
show
her
face
among
her
friend
,
and
weep
grievously
over
her
own
folly
.
<EOS>
those
cruel
word
of
her
father
ring
in
her
ear
constantly
:
 
"
thing
of
that
sort
be
so
often
over
with
you
.
"
<EOS>
the
reproach
,
though
cruel
,
be
true
,
and
what
reproach
more
galling
could
be
utter
to
an
unmarried
girl
such
as
be
Alice
Vavasor
?
<EOS>
She
have
feel
from
the
first
moment
in
which
the
proposition
be
make
to
her
,
that
it
would
be
well
that
she
should
for
a
while
leave
her
home
,
and
especially
that
drawing
-
room
in
Queen
Anne
Street
,
which
tell
her
so
many
tale
that
she
would
fain
forget
,
if
it
be
possible
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
would
not
allow
his
wife
to
remain
in
London
for
the
ten
or
twelve
day
which
must
yet
elapse
before
they
start
,
nor
could
he
send
her
into
the
country
alone
.
<EOS>
He
take
her
down
to
Matching
Priory
,
have
obtain
leave
to
be
absent
from
the
House
for
the
remainder
of
the
Session
,
and
remain
with
her
there
till
within
two
day
of
their
departure
.
<EOS>
that
week
down
at
Matching
,
as
she
afterwards
tell
Alice
,
be
very
terrible
.
<EOS>
He
never
speak
a
word
to
rebuke
her
.
<EOS>
He
never
hint
that
there
have
be
aught
in
her
conduct
of
which
he
have
cause
to
complain
.
<EOS>
He
treat
her
with
a
respect
that
be
perfect
,
and
indeed
with
more
outward
sign
of
affection
than
have
ever
be
customary
with
him
.
"
<EOS>
but
,
"
as
Lady
Glencora
afterwards
express
it
,
"
he
be
always
look
after
me
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
think
that
Burgo
Fitzgerald
have
hide
himself
among
the
ruin
,
"
she
say
once
to
Alice
.
"
<EOS>
He
never
suspect
me
,
I
be
sure
of
that
;
but
he
think
that
he
ought
to
look
after
me
.
"
<EOS>
and
Lady
Glencora
in
this
have
very
nearly
hit
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
have
resolve
,
from
that
hour
in
which
he
have
walk
out
among
the
elm
in
Kensington
Gardens
,
that
he
would
neither
suspect
his
wife
,
nor
treat
her
as
though
he
suspect
her
.
<EOS>
the
blame
have
be
his
,
perhaps
,
more
than
it
have
be
hers
.
<EOS>
so
much
he
have
acknowledge
to
himself
,
think
of
the
confession
she
have
make
to
him
before
their
marriage
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
manifestly
his
imperative
duty
,
 
his
duty
of
duty
,
 
to
save
her
from
that
pitfall
into
which
,
as
she
herself
have
tell
him
,
she
have
be
so
ready
to
fall
.
<EOS>
for
her
sake
and
for
his
this
must
be
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
duty
so
imperative
,
that
in
its
performance
he
have
find
himself
force
to
abandon
his
ambition
.
<EOS>
to
have
his
wife
take
from
him
would
be
terrible
,
but
the
have
it
say
all
over
the
world
that
such
a
misfortune
have
come
upon
him
would
be
almost
more
terrible
even
than
that
.
  
<EOS>
so
he
go
with
his
wife
hither
and
thither
,
down
at
Matching
,
allow
himself
to
be
drive
about
behind
Dandy
and
Flirt
.
<EOS>
He
himself
propose
these
little
excursion
.
<EOS>
They
be
tedious
to
him
,
but
doubly
tedious
to
his
wife
,
who
now
find
it
more
difficult
than
ever
to
talk
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
struggle
to
talk
,
and
he
struggle
to
talk
,
but
the
very
struggle
themselves
make
the
thing
impossible
.
<EOS>
He
sit
with
her
in
the
morning
,
and
he
sit
with
her
in
the
evening
;
he
breakfast
with
her
,
lunch
with
her
,
and
dine
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
go
to
bed
early
,
have
no
figure
which
now
claim
his
attention
.
<EOS>
and
so
the
week
at
last
wear
itself
away
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
him
yawn
sometimes
,
"
Lady
Glencora
say
afterwards
,
"
as
though
he
would
fall
in
piece
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr.
John
Grey
in
Queen
Anne
Street
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
be
resolve
that
she
would
keep
her
promise
to
Kate
,
and
pay
her
visit
to
Westmoreland
before
she
start
with
the
Pallisers
.
<EOS>
Kate
have
write
to
her
three
line
with
her
left
hand
,
beg
her
to
come
,
and
those
three
line
have
be
more
eloquent
than
anything
she
could
have
write
have
her
right
arm
be
uninjured
.
<EOS>
Alice
have
learn
something
of
the
truth
as
to
the
accident
from
her
father
;
or
,
rather
,
have
hear
her
father
's
surmise
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
She
have
hear
,
too
,
how
her
cousin
George
have
bear
himself
when
the
will
be
read
,
and
how
he
have
afterwards
disappear
,
never
show
himself
again
at
the
hall
.
<EOS>
after
all
that
have
pass
she
feel
that
she
owe
Kate
some
sympathy
.
<EOS>
Sympathy
may
,
no
doubt
,
be
convey
by
letter
;
but
there
be
thing
on
which
it
be
almost
impossible
for
any
writer
to
express
himself
with
adequate
feeling
;
and
there
be
thing
,
too
,
which
can
be
speak
,
but
which
can
not
be
write
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
though
the
journey
must
be
a
hurried
one
,
Alice
send
word
down
to
Westmoreland
that
she
be
to
be
expect
there
in
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
on
her
return
she
be
to
go
at
once
to
Park
Lane
,
and
sleep
there
for
the
two
night
which
would
intervene
before
the
departure
of
the
Pallisers
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
day
before
she
start
for
Westmoreland
her
father
come
to
her
in
the
middle
of
the
day
,
and
tell
her
that
John
Grey
be
go
to
dine
with
him
in
Queen
Anne
Street
on
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
-
day
,
papa
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
to

day
.
<EOS>
why
not
?
<EOS>
no
man
be
less
particular
as
to
what
he
eat
than
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
think
of
that
,
papa
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
Mr.
Vavasor
make
no
reply
,
but
stand
for
some
minute
look
out
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
then
he
prepare
to
leave
the
room
,
get
himself
first
as
far
as
the
table
,
where
he
lift
a
book
,
and
then
on
half
-
way
to
the
door
before
Alice
arrest
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
papa
,
you
and
Mr.
Grey
have
well
dine
alone
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
by
alone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
without
me
,
 
as
two
man
generally
like
to
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
want
that
I
should
have
ask
him
to
dine
at
the
club
,
"
say
Mr.
Vavasor
,
and
then
he
again
attempt
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
papa
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
if
you
mean
to
say
that
because
of
what
have
pass
you
object
to
meet
Mr.
Grey
<EOS>
,
I
can
only
tell
you
it
be
nonsense
,
 
confound
nonsense
.
<EOS>
if
he
choose
to
come
there
can
be
no
reason
why
you
should
not
receive
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
look
as
though
 
"
  
"
look
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
though
he
be
ask

my
guest

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
nonsense

<EOS>
I
see
him
yesterday
,
and
I
ask
him
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
see
him
again
to
-
day
,
and
he
say
he
would
come
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
such
a
fool
as
to
suppose
after
that
,
that
you
ask
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
not
that
I
ask
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
if
you
run
away
you
will
only
make
more
of
the
thing
than
it
be
worth
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
can
not
make
you
dine
with
me
if
you
do
not
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
do
not
like
it
,
but
,
after
some
consideration
,
she
think
that
she
may
be
open
to
the
imputation
of
have
make
more
of
the
thing
than
it
be
worth
if
she
run
away
,
as
her
father
call
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
go
to
leave
the
country
for
some
six
or
eight
month
,
 
perhaps
for
a
long
time
than
that
,
and
it
may
be
as
well
that
she
should
have
an
opportunity
of
tell
her
plan
to
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
She
could
do
it
,
she
think
,
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
him
understand
that
her
last
quarrel
with
George
Vavasor
be
not
suppose
to
alter
the
footing
on
which
she
stand
with
him
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
doubt
that
her
father
have
tell
everything
to
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
She
know
well
enough
what
her
father
's
wish
still
be
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
odd
that
he
should
be
ask
John
Grey
to
his
house
,
though
such
exercise
of
domestic
hospitality
be
very
unusual
with
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
 
so
she
declare
to
herself
,
 
such
little
attempt
on
his
part
would
be
altogether
throw
away
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
that
he
have
not
yet
learn
to
know
her
better
.
<EOS>
She
would
receive
Mr.
Grey
as
the
mistress
of
her
father
's
house
now
,
for
the
last
time
;
and
then
,
on
her
return
in
the
following
year
,
he
would
be
at
Nethercoats
,
and
the
whole
thing
would
be
over
.
  
<EOS>
She
dress
herself
very
plainly
,
simply
change
one
black
frock
for
another
,
and
then
sit
herself
in
her
drawing
-
room
await
the
two
gentleman
.
<EOS>
It
be
already
past
the
hour
of
dinner
before
her
father
come
up
-
stair
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
he
be
in
the
house
,
and
in
her
heart
she
accuse
him
of
keep
out
of
the
way
,
in
order
that
John
Grey
may
be
alone
with
her
.
<EOS>
whether
or
no
she
be
right
in
her
suspicion
John
Grey
do
not
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
offer
to
him
.
<EOS>
Her
father
come
up
first
,
and
have
seat
himself
silently
in
his
arm
-
chair
before
the
visitor
be
announce
.
  
<EOS>
as
Mr.
Grey
enter
the
room
Alice
know
that
she
be
flurry
,
but
still
she
manage
to
carry
herself
with
some
dignity
.
<EOS>
His
bearing
be
perfect
.
<EOS>
but
then
,
as
she
declare
to
herself
afterwards
,
no
possible
position
in
life
would
put
him
beside
himself
.
<EOS>
He
come
up
to
her
with
his
usual
quiet
smile
,
 
a
smile
that
be
genial
even
in
its
quietness
,
and
take
her
hand
.
<EOS>
He
take
it
fairly
and
fully
into
his
;
but
there
be
no
squeezing
,
no
special
pressure
,
no
love
-
making
.
<EOS>
and
when
he
speak
to
her
he
call
her
Alice
,
as
though
his
do
so
be
of
all
thing
the
most
simply
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
tell
-
tale
hesitation
in
his
voice
.
<EOS>
when
do
he
ever
hesitate
at
anything
?
<EOS>
"
I
hear
you
be
go
abroad
,
"
he
say
,
"
with
your
cousin
,
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Alice
;
"
I
be
go
with
them
for
a
long
tour
.
<EOS>
We
shall
not
return
,
I
fancy
,
till
the
end
of
next
winter
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
plan
of
that
sort
be
as
easily
break
as
they
be
make
,
"
say
her
father
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
be
your
own
mistress
;
and
I
advise
you
not
to
count
too
surely
upon
get
further
than
Baden
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
if
Mr.
Palliser
change
his
mind
of
course
I
shall
come
home
,
"
say
Alice
,
with
a
little
attempt
at
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
him
a
man
not
prone
to
change
,
"
say
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
but
all
London
be
talk
about
his
change
of
mind
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
They
say
at
the
club
that
he
may
have
be
in
the
Cabinet
if
he
would
,
but
that
he
have
take
up
this
idea
of
go
abroad
at
the
moment
when
he
be
want
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
his
wife
's
do
<EOS>
,
I
take
it
,
"
say
Mr.
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
bad
of
be
in
Parliament
,
"
say
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
a
man
can
not
do
anything
without
give
a
reason
for
it
.
<EOS>
there
must
be
man
for
public
life
,
of
course
;
but
,
upon
my
word
,
I
think
we
ought
to
be
very
much
oblige
to
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
,
as
she
take
her
old
lover
's
arm
,
and
walk
down
with
him
to
dinner
,
think
of
all
her
former
quarrel
with
him
on
this
very
subject
.
<EOS>
on
this
very
point
she
have
leave
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
argue
the
matter
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
ask
her
to
argue
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
condescend
so
far
as
that
.
<EOS>
have
he
do
so
<EOS>
,
she
think
that
she
would
have
bring
herself
to
think
as
he
think
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
strive
,
at
any
rate
,
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
but
she
could
not
become
unambitious
,
tranquil
,
fond
of
retirement
,
and
philosophic
,
without
an
argument
on
the
matter
,
 
without
be
allow
even
the
poor
grace
of
own
herself
to
be
convince
.
<EOS>
if
a
man
take
a
dog
with
him
from
the
country
up
to
town
,
the
dog
must
live
a
town
life
without
know
the
reason
why
;
 
must
live
a
town
life
or
die
a
town
death
.
<EOS>
but
a
woman
should
not
be
treat
like
a
dog
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
have
he
deign
to
discuss
it
with
me
!
"
<EOS>
Alice
have
so
often
say
.
<EOS>
"
but
,
no
;
he
will
read
his
book
,
and
I
be
to
go
there
to
fetch
him
his
slipper
,
and
make
his
tea
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
all
this
come
upon
her
again
as
she
walk
down
-
stair
by
his
side
;
and
with
it
there
come
a
consciousness
that
she
have
be
drive
by
this
usage
into
the
terrible
engagement
which
she
have
make
with
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
that
,
no
doubt
,
be
now
over
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
longer
to
her
any
question
of
her
marry
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
but
the
fact
that
she
have
be
mad
enough
to
think
and
talk
of
such
a
marriage
,
have
of
itself
be
enough
to
ruin
her
.
<EOS>
"
thing
of
that
sort
be
so
often
over
with
you
!
"
<EOS>
after
such
a
speech
as
that
to
her
from
her
father
,
Alice
tell
herself
that
there
could
be
no
more
"
thing
of
that
sort
"
for
her
.
<EOS>
but
all
her
misery
have
be
bring
about
by
this
scornful
superiority
to
the
ordinary
pursuit
of
the
world
,
 
this
look
down
upon
humanity
.
<EOS>
"
It
seem
to
me
,
"
she
say
,
very
quietly
,
while
her
hand
be
yet
upon
his
arm
,
"
that
your
pity
be
hardly
need
.
<EOS>
I
should
think
that
no
person
can
be
happy
than
those
whom
you
call

"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
"
that
be
our
old
quarrel

"
<EOS>
He
say
it
as
though
the
quarrel
have
simply
be
an
argument
between
them
,
or
a
dozen
argument
,
 
as
argument
do
come
up
between
friend
;
not
as
though
it
have
serve
to
separate
for
life
<EOS>
two
person
who
have
love
each
other
dearly
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
old
story
of
the
town
mouse
and
the
country
mouse
,
 
as
old
as
the
hill
.
<EOS>
mouse
may
be
civil
for
a
while
,
and
compliment
each
other
;
but
when
they
come
to
speak
their
mind
freely
,
each
like
his
own
life
best
.

<EOS>
She
say
nothing
more
at
the
moment
,
and
the
three
sit
down
to
their
small
dinner
-
table
.
<EOS>
It
be
astonishing
to
Alice
that
he
should
be
able
to
talk
in
this
way
,
to
hint
at
such
thing
,
to
allude
to
their
former
hope
and
present
condition
,
without
a
quiver
in
his
voice
,
or
,
as
far
as
she
could
perceive
,
without
any
feeling
in
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
say
her
father
,
"
I
can
not
compliment
your
cook
upon
her
soup
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
encourage
her
,
papa
,
by
eat
it
often
enough
.
<EOS>
and
then
you
only
tell
me
at
two
o'clock
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
a
cook
can
not
make
soup
between
two
and
seven

she
can
not
make
it
in
a
week

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
Mr.
Grey
will
excuse
it
,
"

Alice

"
be
not
it
good
?
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
say
that
it
be
,
because
I
should
be
pretend
to
have
an
opinion
;

I
should
not
have
find
out
anything
against
it
of
myself

"
  
<EOS>

where
do
you
dine
usually

now
you
be
in
London

Mr.
Vavasor
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
the
old
club

at
the
corner
of
Suffolk
Street

<EOS>
It
be
the
old
club
in
London
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
I
never
belong
to
any
other
,
and
therefore
can
not
compare
them
;
but
I
can
not
imagine
anything
much
nice

<EOS>
"
They
give
you
well
soup

our
?

Alice

<EOS>
"
You
have
an
excellent
cook
,
"
say
Mr.
Vavasor
,
with
great
gravity
;
"
one
of
the
good
second
-
class
cook
in
London

<EOS>
We
be
very
nearly
get
him
,
but
you
nick
him
just
in
time
.
<EOS>
I
know
him
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
great
deal
more
than
I
do
,
or
hope
to
do
.
<EOS>
there
be
another
branch
of
public
life
for
which
I
be
quite
unfitted
.
<EOS>
I
would
as
soon
be
call
on
to
choose
a
Prime
Minister
for
the
country
,
as
I
would
a
cook
for
a
club
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
would
,
"
say
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
there
may
be
as
many
as
a
dozen
cook
about
London
to
be
look
up

there
be
never
more
than
two
possible
Prime
Ministers
about

as
one
of
them
must
be
go
out
when
the
other
be
come
in
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
see
that
there
can
be
any
difficulty
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
now
-
a
-
day
,
people
do
their
politic
for
themselves
,
but
they
expect
to
have
their
dinner
cook
for
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
little
dinner
go
on
quietly
and
very
easily
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Vavasor
find
fault
with
nearly
everything
.
<EOS>
but
as
,
on
this
occasion
,
the
meat
and
the
drink
,
with
the
manner
of
the
eating
and
drink
,
do
not
constitute
the
difficulty
,
Alice
be
indifferent
to
her
father
's
censure
.
<EOS>
the
thing
need
be
that
she
and
Mr.
Grey
should
be
able
to
sit
together
at
the
same
table
without
apparent
consciousness
of
their
former
tie
.
<EOS>
Alice
feel
that
she
be
succeed
indifferently
well
while
she
be
put
in
little
mock
defence
for
the
cook
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
John
Grey
,
he
succeed
so
well
that
his
success
almost
make
Alice
angry
with
him
.
<EOS>
It
require
no
effort
with
him
at
all
to
be
successful
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
can
forget
all
that
have
pass
,
so
much
the
well
,
"
say
Alice
to
herself
when
she
get
up
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
then
she
sit
herself
down
on
the
sofa
,
and
cry
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
what
have
she
not
lose
!
<EOS>
have
any
woman
ever
be
so
mad

so
reckless

so
heartless
as
she
have
be
!

she
have
do
it
,
know
that
she
love
him
!
<EOS>
She
cry
bitterly
,
and
then
go
away
to
wash
her
eye
,
that
she
may
be
ready
to
give
him
his
coffee
when
he
should
come
up

stair

<EOS>
"
She
do
not
look
well

Grey
as
soon
as
she
have
leave
the
room

<EOS>
"
well
;
 
no
:
how
can
she
look
well
after
what
she
have
go
through

<EOS>
I
sometimes
think
,
that
of
all
the
people
I
ever
know
,
she
have
be
the
most
foolish
.
<EOS>
but
,
of
course
,
it
be
not
for
me

say
anything
against
my

of
all

not
to
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
that
you
could

would
make
any

sometimes
fancy

I

her
better
than
you

you

round
again

I
can
not

that
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
no
one
can
venture
to
say
whether
or
not
such
wound
as
her
may
be
cure
.
<EOS>
there
be
heart
and
body
so
organized
,
that
in
them
severe
wound
be
incurable
,
whereas
in
other
no
injury
seem
to
be
fatal
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
say
that
if
she
be
not
cure
it
shall
not
be
from
want
of
perseverance
on
my
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word

Grey

I
do

you
enough

I
do
not

indeed

me

course
it
be
not

<EOS>
I
know
that
well
enough

in
the
ordinary
way
of
the
world
no
father
would
think
of
thank
a
man
for
want
to
marry
his
daughter

but
thing
have
come
to
such
a
pass
with
us
,
that
,
by
George
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
feel
like
any
other
father

<EOS>
I
do
not
mind
say
anything
to
you

you
know

claret
be

you
may
as
well
take
another
glass

thank
you

I
should
have

that
that
be
rather
good
wine

now

It
be
not
just
the
thing

what
be
the
use
of
my
have
good
wine
here
,
when
nobody
come
to
drink
it
?
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
be
say
about
Alice
,
of
course
I
have
feel
all
this
thing
very
much
.
<EOS>
I
feel
as
though
I
be
responsible
,
and
yet
what
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
She
be
her
own
mistress
through
it
all

<EOS>
when
she
tell
me
she
be
go
to

horrible
miscreant

what
could
I
do

be
over

you

so

what
she
have
do
to
me

not
impair
her
goodness

I
do
not

you
have
ever
understand
how

all
this
have
be
a
matter
of
conscience
with
her

"
  
<EOS>
"
Conscience
!
"
say
the
angry
father
.
<EOS>
"
I
hate
such
conscience

I
like
the
conscience
that
make
a
girl
keep
her
word
,
and
not
bring
disgrace
upon
those
she
belong
to

I
shall
not

disgrace

quietly

"
if
she
will
come
and
be
my
wife

She
have
mean
to
do
right
,

have
endeavour

take
care
of
the
happiness
of
other
people

than
her

shall
not
be
at
all
afraid

mine

will
let
me

she
have
be
wound
sorely
,

it
must
take
time

"
and
,
in
the
meantime
,
what
be
we
to
do
when
she
tell
us
that
Mr.

want
another
remittance

something

from
all
this
it
will
be
see
that
Alice

father

her
lover
still
stand
together
on
confidential
term

not
easily

Mr.
Vavasor
bring
himself
to
speak
of
his
daughter
to
John
Grey

in
such
language

he
have
now
use
;
but
he
have
be
force
by
adverse
circumstance
to
pass
the
Rubicon
of
parental
delicacy

come
to
be
a
considerable
amount
of
confidence
between
the
aunt
and
the
niece
.
<EOS>
Kate
have
acknowledge
to
her
aunt
that
her
brother
have
behave
badly
,
 
very
badly
;
and
the
aunt
have
confess
to
the
niece
that
she
regard
Captain
Bellfield
as
a
fit
subject
for
compassion
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
he
be
violent
to
you
,
and
break
your
arm
?
<EOS>
I
always
know
it
be
so
,
"
Mrs.
Greenow
have
say
,
speak
with
reference
to
her
nephew
.
<EOS>
but
this
Kate
have
deny
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
"
say
she
;
"
that
be
an
accident
.
<EOS>
when
he
go
away
and
leave
me
,
he
know
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
and
if
he
have
break
both
my
arm
I
should
not
have
care
much
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
forgive
him
that
.
"
<EOS>
but
that
which
Kate
could
not
forgive
him
be
the
fault
which
she
have
herself
commit
.
<EOS>
for
his
sake
she
have
do
her
good
to
separate
Alice
and
John
Grey
,
and
George
have
show
himself
to
be
unworthy
of
the
kindness
of
her
treachery
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
give
all
I
have
in
the
world
to
bring
them
together
again
,
"
Kate
say
.
<EOS>
"
They
will
come
together
fast
enough
if
they
like
each
other
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
be
young
still
,
and
they
tell
me
she
be
as
good
look
as
ever
.
<EOS>
a
girl
with
her
money
will
not
have
far
to
seek
for
a
husband
,
even
if
this
paragon
from
Cambridgeshire
should
not
turn
up
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
Alice
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
but
I
know
what
young
woman
be
,
and
I
know
what
young
man
be
.
<EOS>
all
this
nonsense
about
her
cousin
George
,
 
what
difference
will
it
make
?
<EOS>
a
man
like
Mr.
Grey
will
not
care
about
that
,
 
especially
not
if
she
tell
him
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
My
belief
be
that
a
girl
can
have
anything
forgive
her
,
if
she
will
only
tell
it
herself
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
Kate
prefer
the
other
subject
,
and
<EOS>
so
,
I
think
,
do
Mrs.
Greenow
herself
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
my
dear
,
"
she
would
say
,
"
marriage
with
me
,
if
I
should
marry
again
,
would
be
a
very
different
thing
to
your
marriage
,
or
that
of
any
other
young
person
.
<EOS>
as
for
love
,
that
have
be
all
over
for
me
since
poor
Greenow
die
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
nothing
of
the
softness
of
affection
since
I
lay
him
in
his
cold
grave
,
and
never
can
again
.
"
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
,
"
<EOS>
I
say
to
him
,
"
if
you
be
to
kneel
at
my
foot
for
year
,
it
would
not
make
me
care
for
you
in
the
way
of
love
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
what
do
he
say
to
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
I
to
tell
you
what
he
say
?
<EOS>
He
talk
nonsense
about
my
beauty
,
as
all
the
man
do
.
<EOS>
if
a
woman
be
hump
-
backed
,
and
have
only
one
eye
,
they
would
not
be
ashamed
to
tell
her
she
be
a
Venus
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
aunt
,
you
be
a
handsome
woman
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
law
,
my
dear
,
as
if
I
do
not
understand
all
about
it
;
as
if
I
do
not
know
what
make
a
woman
run
after
?
<EOS>
It
be
not
beauty
,
 
and
it
be
not
money
altogether
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
woman
who
have
plenty
of
both
,
and
not
a
man
would
come
nigh
them
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
dare
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
of
them
,
a
man
would
as
soon
think
of
put
his
arm
round
a
poplar
tree
,
they
be
so
hard
and
so
stiff
.
<EOS>
You
know
you
be
a
little
that
way
yourself
,
Kate
,
and
<EOS>
I
have
always
tell
you
it
will
not
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
I
be
too
old
to
mend
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
,
if
you
will
only
set
your
wit
to
work
and
try
.
<EOS>
You
have
plenty
of
money
now
,
and
you
be
good
-
look
enough
,
too
,
when
you
take
the
trouble
to
get
yourself
up
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
say
before
,
it
be
not
that
that
be
want
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
stand
-
off
about
some
woman
,
 
what
the
man
call
a
"
nollimy
tangere
,
"
that
a
man
must
be
quite
a
furious
Orlando
to
attempt
to
get
the
well
of
it
.
<EOS>
They
look
as
though
matrimony
itself
be
improper
,
and
as
if
they
believe
that
little
baby
be
find
about
in
the
hedge
and
ditch
.
<EOS>
They
talk
of
woman
be
forward
!
<EOS>
there
be
some
of
them
a
deal
too
backward
,
accord
to
my
way
of
thinking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yours
be
a
comfortable
doctrine
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
just
what
I
want
it
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
want
thing
to
be
comfortable
.
<EOS>
why
should
not
thing
be
nice
about
one
when
one
be
get
the
mean
?
<EOS>
nobody
can
say
it
be
a
pleasant
thing
to
live
alone
.
<EOS>
I
always
think
that
man
in
the
song
hit
it
off
properly
.
<EOS>
You
remember
what
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
the
poker
and
tong
to
each
other
belong
.
"
<EOS>
so
they
do
,
and
that
should
be
the
way
with
man
and
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
the
poker
and
tong
have
but
a
bad
life
of
it
sometimes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
so
often
as
the
people
say
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
man
and
woman
be
not
like
lump
of
sugar
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
melt
because
the
water
be
sometimes
warm
.
<EOS>
now
,
if
I
do
take
Bellfield
,
 
and
I
really
think
I
shall
;
but
if
I
do
he
will
give
me
a
deal
of
trouble
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
will
.
<EOS>
He
will
always
be
want
my
money
,
and
,
of
course
,
he
will
get
more
than
he
ought
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
a
Solomon
,
nor
yet
a
Queen
of
Sheba
,
no
more
than
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
and
he
will
smoke
too
many
cigar
,
and
perhaps
drink
more
brandy
-
and
-
water
than
he
ought
.
<EOS>
and
he
will
be
make
eye
,
too
,
at
some
of
the
girl
who
will
be
fool
enough
to
let
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
dear
me
,
aunt
,
if
I
think
all
that
ill
of
him
,
I
be
sure
I
would
not
marry
him
;
 
especially
as
you
say
you
do
not
love
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
for
love
,
my
dear
,
that
be
go
,
 
clear
go
!
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
Mrs.
Greenow
put
up
her
handkerchief
to
her
eye
.
<EOS>
"
some
woman
can
love
twice
,
but
I
be
not
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
,
 
I
wish
I
could
!
"
<EOS>
these
last
word
be
speak
in
a
tone
of
solemn
regret
,
which
,
however
,
she
contrive
to
change
as
quickly
as
she
have
adopt
it
.
"
<EOS>
but
my
dear
,
marriage
be
a
comfortable
thing
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
though
the
captain
may
be
a
little
free
,
I
do
not
doubt
but
<EOS>
what
I
shall
get
the
upper
hand
with
him
at
last
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
stop
his
cigar
and
brandy
-
and
-
water
you
know
.
<EOS>
why
should
not
a
man
smoke
and
have
a
glass
,
if
he
do
not
make
a
beast
of
himself
?
<EOS>
I
like
to
see
a
man
enjoy
himself
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
"
she
add
,
speak
tenderly
of
her
absent
lover
,
"
I
do
think
he
be
fond
of
me
,
 
I
do
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
so
be
Mr.
Cheesacre
for
the
matter
of
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
poor
Cheesy
!
<EOS>
I
believe
he
be
,
though
he
do
talk
so
much
about
money
.
<EOS>
I
always
like
to
believe
the
good
I
can
of
them
.
<EOS>
but
then
there
be
no
poetry
about
Cheesy
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
about
say
it
now
,
as
you
have
quite
make
up
your
mind
not
to
have
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
quite

aunt

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
grandfather
's
will
do
make
a
difference
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
be
say
,
I
do
like
a
little
romance
about
them
,
 
just
a
sniff
,
as
I
call
it
,
of
the
rock
and
valley
.
<EOS>
one
know
that
it
do
not
mean
much
;
but
it
be
like
artificial
flower
,
 
it
give
a
little
colour
,
and
take
off
the
dowdiness
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
bread
-
and
-
cheese
be
the
real
thing
.
<EOS>
the
rock
and
valley
be
no
good
at
all
,
if
you
have
not
get
that
,
but
enough
be
as
good
as
a
feast
.
<EOS>
thank
to
dear
Greenow
,
"
 
here
the
handkerchief
be
again
use
 
"
thank
to
dear
Greenow
,
I
shall
never
want
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
shall
not
let
any
of
the
money
go
into
his
hand
,
 
the
Captain
's
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
I
know
a
trick
worth
two
of
that
,
my
dear

<EOS>
but
,
lord
love
you
!
<EOS>
I
have
enough
for
him
and
me

what
be
the
good
of
a
woman
's
want
to
keep
it
all
to
herself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
think
you
will
really
take
him
,

and
pay
his
washerwoman
's
bill
for
him

<EOS>
You
remember

you
tell
me

I
first
see
him

oh

yes

I
remember

if
he
can
not

be
not
that
so
much
more
of
a
reason
that
I
should

well

yes

I
will
take

is

must

chooser

"
  
<EOS>
in
this
way
the
aunt
and
niece
become
very
confidential
,
and
Mrs.
Greenow
whisper
into
Kate
's
ear
her
belief
that
Captain
Bellfield
may
possibly
make
his
way
across
the
country
to
Westmoreland
.

"
there
would
be
no
harm
in
offer
him
a
bed

would
there
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
ask
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
the
inn
at
Shap
be
a
long
way
off
for
morning
call
.
<EOS>
"
Kate
could
not
take
upon
herself
to
say
that
there
would
be
any
harm
,
but
she
do
not
like
the
idea
of
have
Captain
Bellfield
as
a
visitor
.
<EOS>
"
after
all
,
perhaps
he
may
not
come

"
say
the
widow
.
<EOS>

I
do
not
see
where
he
be
to

such
a
journey

quarrel
with
Mr.
Cheesacre

must
come

Vavasor
Hall

visit
have
be
complete

that
be
Kate
's
present
wish

so
much
she
venture
to
confide
to
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
but
there
seem
to
be
no
way
of
stop
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
in
the
least
know
where
he
be
,
my
dear
,
and
as
for
write
to
him
,
I
never
do
such
a
thing
in
my
life
,
and
I
should
not
know
how
to
begin
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
declare
that
she
have
not
positively
invite
the
Captain
;
but
on
this
point
Kate
hardly
give
full
credit
to
her
aunt
's
statement
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
arrive
,
and
,
for
a
day
or
two
,
the
three
lady
live
very
pleasantly
together
.
<EOS>
Kate
still
wear
her
arm
in
a
sling
;
but
she
be
able
to
walk
out
,
and
would
take
long
walk
in
spite
of
the
doctor
's
prohibition
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
they
go
up
on
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
all
the
walk
from
Vavasor
Hall
lead
to
the
mountain
,
unless
one
choose
to
take
the
road
to
Shap
.
<EOS>
but
they
go
up
,
across
the
beacon
hill
,
as
though
by
mutual
consent
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
question
ask
between
them
as
to
the
route
to
be
take
;
and
though
they
do
not
reach
the
stone
on
which
they
have
once
sit
look
over
upon
Haweswater
,
they
do
reach
the
spot
upon
which
Kate
have
encounter
her
accident
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
here
I
fall
,
"
she
say
;
"
and
the
last
I
see
of
him
be
his
back
,
as
he
make
his
way
down
into
the
valley
,
there
.
<EOS>
when
I
get
upon
my
leg
I
could
still
see
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
those
evening
when
the
cloud
be
dark
,
but
you
can
see
all
object
with
a
peculiar
clearness
through
the
air
.
<EOS>
I
stand
here
ever
so
long
,
hold
my
arm
,
and
watch
him
;
but
he
never
once
turn
to
look
back
at
me
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
Alice
,
I
fancy
that
I
shall
never
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
suppose
that
he
mean
to
quarrel
with
you
altogether
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
hardly
tell
you
what
I
mean
!
<EOS>
He
seem
to
me
to
be
go
away
from
me
,
as
though
he
go
into
another
world
.
<EOS>
His
figure
against
the
light
be
quite
clear
,
and
he
walk
quickly
,
and
on
he
go
,
till
the
slope
of
the
hill
hide
him
from
me
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
think
that
he
would
return
to
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
at
one
time
I
almost
fear
that
he
would
come
upon
me
through
the
wood
,
as
I
go
back
myself
.
<EOS>
but
yet
,
I
have
a
feeling
,
 
what
people
call
a
presentiment
,
that
I
should
never
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
never
write
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
not
a
word
.
<EOS>
You
must
remember
that
he

not
know
that
I
have
hurt
myself
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
he
will
not
write
,
and
I
be
sure
,
also
,
that
I
shall
not
.
<EOS>
if
he
want
money
I
would
send
it
to
him
,
but
I
would
not
write
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
he
will
always
want
money
,
Kate
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
he
will
.
<EOS>
if
you
could
know
what
I
suffer
when
he
make
me
write
that
letter
to
you
!
<EOS>
but
,
of
course
,
I
be
a
beast
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
ought
not
to
have
write
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
a
very
proper
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
mean
letter
.
<EOS>
the
whole
thing
be
mean
!
<EOS>
He
should
have
starve
in
the
street
before
he
have
take
your
money
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
give
up
Parliament
,
and
everything
else
!
<EOS>
I
have
doubt
much
about
him
before
,
but
it
be
that
which
first
turn
my
heart
against
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
begin
to
fear
that
he
be
not
such
a
man
as
I
have
always
think
him
,
 
as
I
have
speak
of
him
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
judge
of
him
for
myself
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
do
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
endeavour
to
make
you
judge
kindly
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
dear
!
<EOS>
we
have
both
suffer
for
him
;
you
more
than
I
,
perhaps
;
but
I
,
too
,
have
give
up
everything
for
him
.
<EOS>
My
whole
life
have
be
at
his
service
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
his
creature
,
to
do
his
bidding
,
just
as
he
may
tell
me
.
<EOS>
He
make
me
do
thing
that
I
know
to
be
wrong
,
 
<EOS>
thing
that
be
foreign
to
my
own
nature
;
and
yet
I
almost
worship
him
.
<EOS>
even
now
,
if
he
be
to
come
back
,
I
believe
that
I
should
forgive
him
everything
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
forgive
him
,
but
I
could
never
do
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
he
will
never
come
back
.
<EOS>
He
will
never
ask
us
to
forgive
him
,
or
even
wish
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
long
for
money
till
the
Devil
have
harden
his
heart
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
yet
how
tender
he
could
be
in
his
manner
when
he
choose
it
;
 
<EOS>
how
soft
he
could
make
his
word
and
his
look
!
<EOS>
do
you
remember
how
he
behave
to
us
in
Switzerland
?
<EOS>
do
you
remember
that
balcony
at
Basle
,
and
the
night
we
sit
there
,
when
the
boy
be
swim
down
the
river
?

<EOS>
"
yes

I
remember
.

"
  
"
so
do
I
!
<EOS>
so
do
I
!
<EOS>
alice
,
I
would
give
all
I
have
in

recall

journey

I
do

It
make
no

me

whether
I
stay
in
Westmoreland

abroad

I
must
have
find
out
that
my
god
be
make
of
brick
and
clay
instead
of
gold

there
be
no

"
I
be
not

Kate

you
be

proud
to
own
it

<EOS>

about
Mr.
Grey

would
have
happen

the

,

remain
at
home

"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
it
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
just
the

.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
more
than
this
say
between
them
about
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
even
to
her
cousin
,
Alice
could
not
bring
herself
to
talk
freely
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
She
would
never
allow
herself
to
think
,
for
a
moment
,
that
she
have
be
persuade
by
other
to
treat
him
as
she
have
treat
him
.
<EOS>
She
be
sure
that
she
have
act
on
her
own
conviction
of
what
be
right
and
wrong
;
and
now
,
though
she
have
begin
to
feel
that
she
have
be
wrong
,
she
would
hardly
confess
as
much
even
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
They
walk
back
,
down
the
hill
,
to
the
Hall
in
silence
for
the
great
part
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
once
or
twice
Kate
repeat
her
conviction
that
she
should
never
again
see
her
brother
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
may
happen
to
him
,
"
she
say
in
answer
to
her
cousin
's
question
;
"
but
when
he
be
pass
out
of
my
sight
into
the
valley
,
I
feel
that
I
be
look
at
him
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
simply
what
people
call
a
presentiment
,
"
Alice
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
exactly
so
;
and
presentiment
,
of
course
,
mean
nothing
,
"
say
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
then
they
walk
on
towards
the
house
without
further
speech
;
but
when
they
reach
the
end
of
the
little
path
which
lead
out
of
the
wood
,
on
to
the
gravelled
sweep
before
the
front
door
,
they
be
both
arrest
by
a
sight
that
meet
their
eye
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
man
stand
,
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
,
before
them
,
swinge
a
little
cane
,
and
look
about
him
up
at
the
wood
.
<EOS>
He
have
on
his
head
a
jaunty
little
straw
-
hat
,
and
he
wear
a
jacket
with
brass
button
,
and
white
trouser
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
nearly
the
middle
of
May
,
but
the
summer
do
not
come
to
Westmoreland
so
early
as
that
,
and
the
man
,
as
he
stand
there
look
about
him
,
seem
to
be
cold
and
almost
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
as
yet
see
the
two
girl
,
who
stand
at
the
end
of
the
walk
,
arrest
by
the
sight
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
who
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Alice
,
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Bellfield
,
"
say
Kate
,
speak
with
something
very
like
dismay
in
her
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
aunt
Greenow
's
Captain
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
aunt
Greenow
's
Captain
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
fear
this
,
and
now
,
what
on
earth
be
we
to
do
with
him
?
<EOS>
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
that
be
what
aunt
Greenow
call
a
sniff
of
the
rock
and
valley
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
begin
to
move
,
 
just
to
move
,
as
though
it
be
necessary
to
do
something
to
keep
the
life
in
his
limb
.
<EOS>
He
have
finish
his
cigar
,
and
look
at
the
end
of
it
with
manifest
regret
.
<EOS>
as
he
throw
it
away
among
a
tuft
of
shrub
his
eye
fall
upon
the
two
lady
,
and
he
utter
a
little
exclamation
.
<EOS>
then
he
come
forward
,
wave
his
little
straw
-
hat
in
his
hand
,
and
make
his
salutation
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Vavasor
,
I
be
delighted
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Miss
Alice
Vavasor
,
if
I
be
not
mistaken
?
<EOS>
I
have
be
commission
by
my
dear
friend
Mrs.
Greenow
to
go
out
and
seek
you
,
but
,
upon
my
word
,
the
wood
look
so
black
that
I
do
not
dare
to
venture
;
 
and
then
,
of
course
,
I
should
not
have
find
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Kate
put
out
her
left
hand
,
and
then
introduce
her
cousin
to
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
again
he
wave
his
little
straw
-
hat
,
and
strove
to
bear
himself
as
though
he
be
at
home
and
comfortable
.
<EOS>
but
he
fail
,
and
it
be
manifest
that
he
fail
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
the
Bellfield
who
have
conquer
Mr.
Cheesacre
on
the
sand
at
Yarmouth
,
though
he
wear
the
same
jacket
and
waistcoat
,
and
must
now
have
enjoy
the
internal
satisfaction
of
feeling
that
his
future
maintenance
in
life
be
assure
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
not
at
his
ease
.
<EOS>
His
courage
have
suffice
to
enable
him
to
follow
his
quarry
into
Westmoreland
,
but
it
do
not
suffice
to
make
him
comfortable
while
he
be
there
.
<EOS>
Kate
instantly
perceive
his
condition
,
and
wickedly
resolve
that
she
would
make
no
effort
to
assist
him
.
<EOS>
She
go
through
some
ceremony
of
introduction
,
and
then
express
her
surprise
at
see
him
so
far
north
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
he
;
"
I
be
a
little
surprised
myself
;
 
I
be
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
but
I
have
nothing
to
do
in
Norwich
,
 
literally
nothing
;
and
your
aunt
have
so
often
talk
to
me
of
the
beauty
of
this
place
,
"
 
and
he
wave
his
hand
round
at
the
old
house
and
the
dark
tree
<EOS>
,
 
"
that
I
think
I
would
take
the
liberty
of
pay
you
a
flying
visit
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
intrude
in
the
way
of
sleep
;
I
do
not
indeed
,
Miss
Vavasor
;
only
Mrs.
Greenow
have
be
so
kind
as
to
say
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
We
be
so
very
far
out
of
the
world
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
that
we
always
give
our
visitor
bed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
intend
it
;
I
do
not
indeed
,
miss
!
"
<EOS>
Poor
Captain
Bellfield
be
become
very
uneasy
in
his
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
just
put
my
bag
,
with
a
change
of
thing
,
into
the
gig
,
which
bring
me
over
,
not
know
quite
where
I
may
go
on
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
not
send
you
any
further
to
-
day
,
at
any
rate

say
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Greenow
have
be
very
kind
,
 
very
kind
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
She
have
ask
me
to
stay
till
 
Saturday
!
"
  
<EOS>
Kate
bite
her
lip
in
a
momentary
fit
of
anger
.
<EOS>
the
house
be
her
house
,
and
not
her
aunt
's
.
<EOS>
but
she
remember
that
her
aunt
have
be
kind
to
her
at
Norwich
and
at
Yarmouth
,
and
she
allow
this
feeling
to
die
away
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
you
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
three
woman
together
here
,
and
I
be
afraid
you
will
find
us
rather
dull
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
,
no
,
 
dull
with
you
!
<EOS>
that
would
be
impossible
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
how
have
you
leave
your
friend
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
quite
well
;
 
very
well
,
thank
you
.
<EOS>
that
be
to
say
,
I
have
not
see
him
much
lately
.
<EOS>
He
and
I
do
have
a
bit
of
a
breeze
,
you
know

<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
that
I
do
know

Captain
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
perhaps
,
you
have
hear
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
think
that
I
be
too
particular
in
a
certain
quarter
!
<EOS>
ha
 
ha
 
ha
 
ha
!
<EOS>
that
be
only
my
joke
,
you
know
,
lady
.

"
  
<EOS>
They
then
go
into
the
house
,
and
the
Captain
straggle
in
after
them
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
be
in
neither
of
the
two
sit
-
room
which
they
usually
occupy
.
<EOS>
She
,
too
,
have
be
drive
somewhat
out
of
the
ordinary
composure
of
her
manner
by
the
arrival
of
her
lover
,
 
even
though
she
have
expect
it
,
and
have
retire
to
her
room
,
think
that
she
have
better
see
Kate
in
private
before
they
meet
in
the
presence
of
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
have
see
my
aunt
since
you
have
be
here
?
"
say
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
dear
,
yes
.
<EOS>
I
see
her
,
and
she
suggest
that
I
have
better
walk
out
and
find
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
find
you
,
you
know
,
though
I
do
not
walk
very
far
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
have
you
see
your
room
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
 
yes
.
<EOS>
She
be
kind
enough
to
show
me
my
room
.
<EOS>
very
nice
indeed
,
thank
you
;
 
look
out
into
the
front
,
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
poor
fellow
be
no
doubt
think
how
much
better
be
his
lot
at
Vavasor
Hall
than
it
have
be
at
Oileymead
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
stay
long
,
Miss
Vavasor
,
 
only
just
a
night
or
so
;
but
I
do
want
to
see
your
aunt
again
,
 
and
you
,
too
,
upon
my
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
aunt
be
the
attraction
,
Captain
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
We
all
know
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
actually
simper
,
 
simper
like
a
young
girl
who
be
half
elated
and
half
ashamed
when
her
lover
be
throw
in
her
tooth
.
<EOS>
He
fidget
with
the
thing
on
the
table
,
and
move
himself
about
uneasily
from
one
leg
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
be
remember
that
though
he
have
contrive
to
bring
himself
to
Vavasor
Hall
he
have
not
money
enough
leave
to
take
him
back
to
Norwich
.
<EOS>
the
two
girl
leave
him
and
go
to
their
room
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
to
my
aunt
at
once
,
"
say
Kate
,
"
and
find
out
what
be
to
be
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
she
mean
to
marry
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
she
mean
to
marry
him
,
and
the
sooner
the
well
now
.
<EOS>
I
know
this
be
come
,
but
I
do
so
hope
it
would
not
be
while
you
be
here
.
<EOS>
It
make
me
feel
so
ashamed
of
myself
that
you
should
see
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Kate
boldly
knock
at
her
aunt
's
door
,
and
her
aunt
receive
her
with
a
conscious
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
wait
for
you
to
come

say
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
I

Captain
Bellfield
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
stupid
man
!
<EOS>
I
tell
him
to
take
himself
away
about
the
place
till
dinner
-
time
.
<EOS>
I
have
half
a
mind
to
send
him
back
to
Shap
at
once
;
 
upon
my
word
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
not
do
that
,
aunt
;
it
would
be
inhospitable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
he
be
such
an
oaf
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
understand
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
that
I
could
not
help
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
do
mean
to
 
to
marry
him
,
aunt
;
do
not
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Kate
,
I
really
think
I
do
.
<EOS>
why
should
not
I
?
<EOS>
It
be
a
lonely
sort
of
life
be
by
myself
;
and
,
upon
my
word
,
I
do
not
think
there
be
very
much
harm
in
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
say
anything
against
him
;
only
in
that
case
you
can
not
very
well
turn
him
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Could
not
I
,
though
?
<EOS>
I
could
in
a
minute
;
and
,
if
you
wish
it
,
you
shall
see
if
I
can
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
rock
and
valley
would
not
allow
that
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
very
well
for
you
to
laugh
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
if
laugh
would
break
my
bone
I
should
not
be
as
whole
as
I
be
now
.
<EOS>
I
may
have
have
Cheesacre
if
I
like
,
who
be
a
substantial
man
,
and
could
have
keep
a
carriage
for
me
;
but
it
be
the
rock
and
valley
that
prevent
that
;
 
and
perhaps
a
little
feeling
that
I
may
do
some
good
to
a
poor
fellow
who
have
nobody
in
the
world
to
look
after
him
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
,
as
she
say
this
,
put
her
handkerchief
up
to
her
eye
,
and
wipe
away
the
springing
moisture
.
<EOS>
tear
be
always
easy
with
her
,
but
on
this
occasion
Kate
almost
respect
her
tear
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
hope
you
will
be
happy
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
he
make
me
unhappy
he
shall
pay
for
it
;
"
and
Mrs.
Greenow
,
have
do
with
the
tear
,
shake
her
head
,
as
though
upon
this
occasion
she
quite
mean
all
that
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
at
dinner
they
be
not
very
comfortable
.
<EOS>
either
the
gloomy
air
of
the
place
and
the
neighbourhood
of
the
black
pine
have
depress
the
Captain
,
or
else
the
glorious
richness
of
the
prospect
before
him
have
make
him
thoughtful
.
<EOS>
He
have
lay
aside
the
jacket
with
the
brass
button
,
and
have
dress
himself
for
dinner
very
soberly
.
<EOS>
and
he
behave
himself
at
dinner
and
after
dinner
with
a
wonderful
sobriety
,
be
very
unlike
the
Captain
who
have
sit
at
the
head
of
the
table
at
Mrs.
Greenow
's
picnic
.
<EOS>
when
leave
to
himself
after
dinner
he
barely
swallow
two
glass
of
the
old
Squire
's
port
wine
before
he
saunter
out
into
the
garden
to
join
the
lady
,
whom
he
have
see
there
;
and
when
press
by
Kate
to
light
a
cigar
he
positively
decline
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
follow
morning
Mrs.
Greenow
have
recover
her
composure
,
but
Captain
Bellfield
be
still
in
a
rather
disturbed
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
his
effort
be
to
be
crown
with
success
,
and
that
he
be
sure
of
his
wife
,
but
he
do
not
know
how
the
preliminary
difficulty
be
to
be
overcome
,
and
he
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
himself
at
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
after
breakfast
he
fidget
about
in
the
parlour
,
be
unable
to
contrive
for
himself
a
mode
of
escape
,
and
be
absolutely
throw
upon
his
beam
-
end
when
the
widow
ask
him
what
he
mean
to
do
with
himself
between
that
and
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
would
better
take
a
walk
,
"
he
say
;
"
and
perhaps
the
young
lady
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
if
you
mean
my
two
niece
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
I
be
afraid
you
will
find
they
be
engage
.
<EOS>
but
if
I
be
not
too
old
to
walk
with
 
<EOS>
"
the
Captain
assure
her
that
she
be
just
of
the
proper
age
for
a
walk
companion
,
as
far
as
his
taste
go
,
and
then
attempt
some
apology
for
the
awkwardness
of
his
expression
,
at
which
the
three
woman
laugh
heartily
.
"
<EOS>
never
mind
,
Captain
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
have
our
walk
all
the
same
,
and
will
not
mind
those
young
girl
.
<EOS>
come
along
.
<EOS>
"
They
start
,
not
up
towards
the
mountain
,
as
Kate
always
do
when
she
walk
in
Westmoreland
,
but
mildly
,
and
at
a
gentle
pace
,
as
beseem
their
year
,
along
the
road
towards
Shap
.
<EOS>
the
Captain
politely
open
the
old
gate
for
the
widow
,
and
then
carefully
close
it
again
,
 
not
allow
it
to
swing
,
as
he
would
have
do
at
Yarmouth
.
<EOS>
then
he
trip
up
to
his
place
beside
her
,
suggest
his
arm
,
which
she
decline
,
and
walk
on
for
some
pace
in
silence
.
<EOS>
what
on
earth
be
he
to
say
to
her
?
<EOS>
He
have
do
his
love
-
make
successfully
,
and
what
be
he
to
do
next
?
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
They
be
walk
very
slowly
,
and
he
be
cut
the
weed
by
the
roadside
with
his
cane
.
<EOS>
He
know
by
her
voice
that
something
special
be
come
,
so
he
leave
the
weed
and
range
himself
close
up
alongside
of
her
.
"
<EOS>
well
,
Captain
Bellfield
,
 
<EOS>
so
I
suppose
I
be
to
be
good
-
natured
;
be
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Arabella
,
you
will
make
me
the
happy
man
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
fudge
.
<EOS>
"
She
would
have
say
,
"
all
rock
and
valley
,
"
only
he
would
not
have
understand
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
shall
make
you
respectable
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
certainly
.
<EOS>
I
quite
intend
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
great
thing
that
you
should
intend
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
be
go
to
make
a
fool
of
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
;
do
not

that

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
do
not

it
,
all
my
friend
will
say
it
for
me

<EOS>
It
be
lucky
for
you
that
I
do
not

care
what
people
say

<EOS>
"
  
"
It
be
lucky
;
 
I
know
that
I
be
lucky
.
<EOS>
the
very
first
day
I
see
you
<EOS>
I
think
what
a
happy
fellow
I
be
to
meet
you
.
<EOS>
then
,
of
course

I
be
only
think
of
your
beauty

as
we
be
to
be
man

as
well

<EOS>
"
at
this
moment
he
have
get
very
close
to
her
,
and
have
recover
something
of
his
usual
elasticity
;
but
she
would
not
allow
him
even
to
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
out
in
the
high
road
!
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
be
so
impertinent
,
 
and
so
foolish
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
as
well

just
once

"
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Bellfield
,
I
bring
you
out
here
not
for
such
fooling
as
that
,

in
order
that

may
have
a
little
chat
about
business
.
<EOS>
if
we
be
to
be
man
and
wife
,
as
you
say
,
we
ought
to
understand
on
what
footing
we
be
to
begin
together

<EOS>
I
be
afraid
your
own
private
mean
be
not
considerable

"
  
<EOS>
"
well

no
;
they
be
not

<EOS>
the
Captain
hesitate
,
and
poke
the
ground
with
his
cane
.
<EOS>
"
come
,
Captain
Bellfield

let
us
have
the
truth
at
once

shall
understand
each

"
<EOS>
the
Captain
still
hesitate
,
and
say
nothing

"
You
must
have
have
something
to
live
upon
,
I
suppose
?
"
suggest
the
widow
.
<EOS>
then
the
Captain
,
by
degree
,
tell
his
story
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
married
sister
by
whom
a
guinea

that
be
all

<EOS>
He

the
price
of
his
commission

<EOS>
He

two

<EOS>
the
tailor
at
Yarmouth
have

him
three

<EOS>
in
the
course
of
the
cross
-
examination

much
information
out
of
him
;
and
then
,
when
she
be
satisfied
that
she
have

,
not
exactly
all
the
truth
,
but
certain
indication
of
the
truth
<EOS>
,
she
forgive
him
all
his
offence
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
you
will
give
a
fellow
a
kiss
,
 
just
one
kiss
,
"
say
the
ecstatic
Captain
,
in
the
height
of
his
bliss

<EOS>
"
Hush

arm
before
the
first
kiss
of
permit

-
nuptial
love

be
exchange
.
<EOS>
the
scene
be
on
the
high
road
from
Shap
to
Vavasor
,
and
as
she
be
still
dress
in
all
the
sombre
habiliment
of
early
widowhood
,
and
as
neither
he
nor
his
sweetheart
be
under
forty
,
perhaps
it
be
as
well
that
they
be
not
catch
toy
together
in
so
very
public
a
place
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
only
just
in
time
to
escape
the
vigilant
eye
of
a
new
visitor
.
<EOS>
round
the
corner
of
the
road
,
at
a
sharp
trot
,
come
the
Shap
post
-
horse
,
with
the
Shap
gig
behind
him
,
 
the
same
gig
which
have
bring
Bellfield
to
Vavasor
on
the
previous
day
,
 
and
seat
in
the
gig
,
loom
large
,
with
his
eye
wide
awake
to
everything
round
him
,
be
 
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
sight
terrible
to
the
eye
of
Captain
Bellfield
,
and
by
no
means
welcome
to
those
of
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
as
regard
her
,
her
annoyance
have
chiefly
reference
to
her
two
niece
,
and
especially
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
how
be
she
to
account
for
this
second
lover
?
<EOS>
Kate
,
of
course
,
know
all
about
it
;
but
how
could
Alice
be
make
to
understand
that
she
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
be
not
to
blame
,
 
that
she
have
,
in
sober
truth
,
tell
this
ardent
gentleman
that
there
be
no
hope
for
him
?
<EOS>
and
even
as
to
Kate
,
 
Kate
,
whom
her
aunt
have
absurdly
choose
to
regard
as
the
object
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
pursuit
,
 
what
sort
of
a
welcome
would
she
extend
to
the
owner
of
Oileymead
?
<EOS>
before
the
wheel
have
stop
,
Mrs.
Greenow
have
begin
to
reflect
whether
it
may
be
possible
that
she
should
send
Mr.
Cheesacre
back
without
let
him
go
on
to
the
Hall
;
but
if
Mrs.
Greenow
be
dismay
,
what
be
the
feeling
of
the
Captain
?
<EOS>
for
he
be
aware
that
Cheesacre
know
that
of
him
which
he
have
not
tell
.
<EOS>
how
ardently
do
he
now
wish
that
he
have
sail
nearer
to
the
truth
in
give
in
the
schedule
of
his
debt
to
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
man
's
want
by
the
police
,
"
say
Cheesacre
,
speak
while
the
gig
be
still
in
motion
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
want
by
the
police
,
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
and
in
his
ardour
he
stand
up
in
the
gig
and
point
at
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
then
the
gig
stop
suddenly
,
and
he
fall
back
into
his
seat
in
his
effort
to
prevent
his
fall
forward
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
want
by
the
police
,
"
he
shout
out
again
,
as
soon
as
he
be
able
to
recover
his
voice
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
turn
pale
beneath
the
widow
's
veil
which
she
have
drop
.
<EOS>
what
may
not
her
Captain
have
do
?
<EOS>
He
may
have
procure
thing
,
to
be
send
to
him
,
out
of
shop
on
false
pretence
;
or
,
urge
on
by
want
and
famine
,
he
may
have
commit
 
forgery
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
my
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
and
drop
her
hand
from
his
arm
,
which
she
have
take
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
false
,
"
say
Bellfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
true
,
"
say
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
indict
you
for
slander
,
my
friend
,
"
say
Bellfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
pay
me
the
money
you
owe
me
,
"
say
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
swindler
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
care
little
as
to
her
lover
be
a
swindler
in
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
estimation
.
<EOS>
such
accusation
from
him
she
have
hear
before
.
<EOS>
but
she
do
care
very
much
as
to
this
mission
of
the
police
against
her
Captain
.
<EOS>
if
that

"
It

He

what

It

<EOS>
"

in
a
tone
of
voice
which

"
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
you
should
not
come
and
say
such
thing
;
 
you
should
not
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
Sheriff
's
officer
can
be
pay
,
and
there
be
an
end
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
indict
him
for
the
libel
 
<EOS>
I
will
,
as
sure
as
I
be
alive

say
Bellfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
"
say
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
make
a
fool
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
when
man
can
not
pay
their
way
they

put
up
with

thing
like
that

<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
where
be

go
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
to
Vavasor
Hall
,
on
purpose
to
caution
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
too
late
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
,
sink
behind
her
veil
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
have
not
be
and
marry
him
since
yesterday
?
<EOS>
He
only
have
twenty
-
four
hour

start
of
me
,
I
know

<EOS>
or
,
perhaps
,
you
have
it
do
clandestine
in
Norwich

<EOS>
oh
,
Mrs.
Greenow
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
get
out
of
the
gig
,
and
the
three
walk
back
towards
the
Hall
together
,
while
the
boy
drive
on
with
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
carpetbag
.
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
whether
we
can
welcome
you

<EOS>
there
be
other
visitor

and

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
one
to
intrude

<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
of
that

<EOS>
if
I

I
can
get
at
for
money

<EOS>
that
be
more
than
some
people
can
say

<EOS>
I
wonder
when
you
be
go
to
pay
me
what
you
owe
me
,
Lieutenant
Bellfield

"
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
the
widow
have
contrive
to
reconcile
the
two
man
before
she
reach
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
They
have
actually
shake
hand
,
and
the
lamb
Cheesacre
have
agree
to
lie
down
with
the
wolf
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
cheesacre
,
moreover
,
have
contrive
to
whisper
into
the
widow
's
ear
the
true
extent
of
his
errand
into
Westmoreland
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
he
do
not
do
altogether
in
Bellfield
's
hearing
.
<EOS>
when
Mrs.
Greenow
ascertain
that
there
be
something
to
be
say
,
she
make
no
scruple
in
send
her
betroth
away
from
her
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
throw
a
fellow
over
,
will
you
,
now
?
"
<EOS>
whisper
Bellfield
into
her
ear
as
he
go
.
<EOS>
She
merely
frown
at
him
,
and
bade
him
begone
,
so
that
the
walk
which
Mrs.
Greenow
begin
with
one
lover
she
end
in
company
with
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
Bellfield
,
who
be
send
on
to
the
house
,
find
Alice
and
Kate
survey
the
newly
arrive
carpet
bag

"
<EOS>
He
know

un

the
boy
who
have
drive
the
gig
,
point
to
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
belong
to
your
old
friend
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
"
say
Bellfield
to
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
have
he
come
too
?
"
say
Kate
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
shrug
his
shoulder
,
and
admit
that
it
be
hard
.
"
<EOS>
and
it
be
not
the
slight
use
,
"
say
he
,
"
not
the
least
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
He
never
have
a
chance
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
enough
of
the
rock
and
valley
about
him
,
be
there
,
Captain
Bellfield
?
"
say
Kate
.
<EOS>
but
Captain
Bellfield
understand
nothing
about
the
rock
and
valley
,
though
he
be
regard
by
certain
eye
as
be
both
a
rock
and
a
valley
himself
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
Cheesacre
be
tell
his
story
.
<EOS>
He
first
ask
,
in
a
melancholy
tone
,
whether
it
be
really
necessary
that
he
must
abandon
all
his
hope
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
not
go
to
say
anything
against
the
Captain
,
"
he
say
,
"
if
thing
be
really
fix
.
<EOS>
He
never
begrudge
any
man
his
chance
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
thing
be
really
fix
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
,
however
,
not
keep
himself
from
hint
that
Oileymead
be
a
substantial
home
,
and
that
Bellfield
have
not
as
much
as
a
straw
mattress
to
lie
upon
.
<EOS>
in
answer
to
this
Mrs.
Greenow
tell
him
that
there
be
so
much
more
reason
why
some
one
should
provide
the
poor
man
with
a
mattress
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
look
at
it
in
that
light
,
of
course
it
be
true
,
"
say
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
tell
him
that
she
do
look
at
it
in
that
light
.
"
<EOS>
then
I
have
do
about
that
,
"
say
Cheesacre
;
"
and
as
to
the
little
bit
of
money
he
owe
me
,
I
must
give
him
his
time
about
it
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Greenow
assure
him
that
it
should
be
pay
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
nuptial
benediction
have
be
say
over
them
.
<EOS>
She
offer
,
indeed
,
to
pay
it
at
once
if
he
be
in
distress
for
it
,
but
he
answer
contemptuously
that
he
never
be
in
distress
for
money
.
<EOS>
He
like
to
have
his
own
,
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
he
do
not
get
away
to
his
next
subject
quite
so
easily
as
he
wish
;
and
it
must
be
admit
that
there
be
a
difficulty
.
<EOS>
as
he
could
not
have
Mrs.
Greenow
he
would
be
content
to
put
up
with
Kate
for
his
wife
.
<EOS>
that
be
his
next
subject
.
<EOS>
rumour
as
to
the
old
Squire
's
will
have
no
doubt
reach
him
,
and
he
be
now
willing
to
take
advantage
of
that
assistance
which
Mrs.
Greenow
have
before
offer
him
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
the
time
have
come
in
which
he
ought
to
marry
;
of
that
he
be
aware
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
many
of
his
friend
in
Norfolk
that
Kate
Vavasor
have
throw
herself
at
his
head
,
and
very
probably
he
have
think
it
true
.
<EOS>
in
answer
to
all
his
love
speech
to
herself
,
the
aunt
have
always
tell
him
what
an
excellent
wife
her
niece
would
make
him
.
<EOS>
so
now
he
have
come
to
Westmoreland
with
this
second
string
to
his
bow
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
you
put
it
into
my
head
your
own
self
,
"
plead
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
,
now
?
"
  
"
but
thing
be
so
different
since
that
,
"
say
the
widow
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
different
?
<EOS>
I
be
not
different
.
<EOS>
there
be
Oileymead
just
where
it
always
be
,
and
the
owner
of
it
do
not
owe
a
shilling
to
any
man
.
<EOS>
how
be
thing
different
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
niece
have
inherit
property
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
be
that
to
make
a
change
?
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
,
who
would
have
think
to
find
you
mercenary
like
that
?
<EOS>
inherit
property
!
<EOS>
be
she
go
to
fle
a
man
over
because
of
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
endeavour
to
explain
to
him
that
her
niece
could
hardly
be
say
to
have
fling
him
over
,
and
at
last
pretend
to
become
angry
when
he
attempt
to
assert
his
position
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
I
be
quite
sure
she
never
give
you
a
word
of
encouragement
in
her
life
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
always
tell
me
I
may
have
her
for
the
asking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
I
tell
you
that
you
may
not
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
no
use
your
go
on
there
to
ask
her
,
for
she
will
only
send
you
away
with
an
answer
you
will
not
like
.
<EOS>
look
here
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
;
you
want
to
get
married
,
and
it
be
quite
time
you
should
.
<EOS>
there
be
my
dear
friend
Charlie
Fairstairs
.
<EOS>
how
could
you
get
a
well
wife
than
Charlie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Charlie
Fairstairs
!
<EOS>
"
say
Cheesacre
,
turn
up
his
nose
in
disgust
.
<EOS>
"
She
have
not
get
a
penny
,
nor
any
one
belong
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
man
who
marry
her
will
have
to
find
the
money
for
the
smock
she
stand
up
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
mercenary
now
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
?
<EOS>
do
you
go
home
and
think
of
it
;
and
if
you
will
marry
Charlie
,
I
will
go
to
your
wedding
.
<EOS>
You
shall
not
be
ashamed
of
her
clothing
.
<EOS>
I
will
see
to
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
be
now
close
to
the
gate
,
and
Cheesacre
pause
before
he
enter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
think
there
be
no
chance
at
all
for
me
,
then
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
there
be
none

<EOS>
I
have
hear
her
speak
about
it

"
  
<EOS>
"
somebody
else
,
perhaps
,
be
the
happy
man
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not

anything
about
that
,

I
know
that

you

I
like
farm
,
you
know
,
but
she
do
not

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
give
that
up

say
Cheesacre
readily
,
 
"
at
any
rate
,
for
a
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

no

no

it

do
no

believe
me
,
my

that
it
be
of
no
use

"
  
<EOS>
He
still
pause
at
the
gate
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
what
be
the
use
of
my
go
in
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
to
this
she
make
him
no
answer
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
pride
about
me

he
continue
,
"
that
I
do
not

I

Mr.

that
you
be
want
in

certainly

"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
go

<EOS>
perhaps
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
tell
the
boy
with
the
gig
to
come
after
me
?
<EOS>
that
be
six
pound
ten
it
will
have
cost
me
to
come
here

go
back

Bellfield
do
it
cheap

of
course
;
he
travel
second
class

I
hear
of
him

I
come
along

the
expense
do
not

to
you

Mr.

<EOS>
to
this
he
assent
,
and
then
take
his
leave
,
at
first
offer
his
hand
to
Mrs.
Greenow
with
an
air
of
offend
dignity
,
but
fall
back
almost
into
humility
during
the
performance
of
his
adieu
.
<EOS>
before
he
be
go
he
have
invite
her
to
bring
the
captain
to
Oileymead
when
she
be
married

have
beg
her
to
tell
Miss
Vavasor
how
happy
he
should
be
to
receive
her

and
Mr.

the
widow
,
as
he
walk
back
along
the
road
,
"
do
not

important
be
the
question

<EOS>
He
have
go
,

the
widow

<EOS>
Bellfield
be
so
relieved
that
he
could
not
restrain
his
joy

take
off
his
little
straw
hat
and
throw
it
up
into
the
air

Kate
's
satisfaction
be
almost
as
intense

I
be
so
glad

what
on

much

Kate
suggest
that
she
should
get
into

drive
after
him

He
be
not

been

take
hisself
off

suggest
the
boy
,
whose
face
become
very
dismal
as
the
terrible
idea
strike
him

<EOS>
but
,
with
juvenile
craft
,
he
put
his
hand
on
the
carpet

bag

and
find
that
it
do
not

stone

be
comfort

You
drive

you
will
find
him
on

road
to
Shap

Mrs.
Greenow

"
mind
you
give
him
my
love

the
Captain
in

I
hope
he
will
get
his
turnip
in
well

"
  
<EOS>
this
little
episode
go
far
to
break
the
day
,
and
do
more
than
anything
else
could
have
do
to
put
Captain
Bellfield
at
his
ease
.
<EOS>
It
create
a
little
joint
-
stock
fund
of
merriment
between
the
whole
party
,
which
be
very
much
need

<EOS>
the
absence
of
such
joint

stock
fund
be
always
feel
when
a
small
party
be
throw
together
without
such
assistance
.
<EOS>
some
bond
be
necessary
on
these
occasion

and
no
other
bond
be
so
easy
or
so
pleasant

<EOS>
now
,
when
the
Captain
find
himself
alone
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
Alice

he
have
plenty
of
subject
for
small

yes

indeed

Old

sort
of
fellow
at
bottom
;
 
awfully
fond
of
his
money
,
you
know
,
Miss
Vavasor
,
and
always
boast
about
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
that
be
not
pleasant
,
"
say
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
,
the
most
unpleasant
thing
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
I
hate
so
much
,
Miss
Vavasor
,
as
that
kind
of
talking
.
<EOS>
My
idea
be
this
,
 
when
a
man
have
lot
of
money
,
let
him
make
the
good
use
he
can
of
it
,
and
say
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
nobody
ever
hear
me
talk
about
my
money
.
"
<EOS>
He
know
that
Alice
know
that
he
be
a
pauper
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
have
the
satisfaction
of
speak
of
himself
as
though
he
be
not
a
pauper
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
way
the
afternoon
go
very
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
for
an
hour
before
dinner
Captain
Bellfield
be
have
into
the
drawing
-
room
and
be
talk
to
by
his
widow
on
matter
of
business
;
but
he
have
of
course
know
that
this
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
She
scold
him
soundly
about
those
sheriff
's
officer
.
<EOS>
why
have
he
not
tell
her
?
"
<EOS>
as
long
as
there
be
anything
keep
back
,
I
will
not
have
you
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
become
your
wife
till
I
be
quite
sure
there
be
not
a
penny
owe
that
be
not
show
in
the
list
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
I
think
he
do
tell
her
all
,
 
or
nearly
all
.
<EOS>
when
all
be
count
it
be
not
so
very
much
.
<EOS>
three
or
four
hundred
pound
would
make
him
a
new
man
,
and
what
be
such
a
sum
as
that
to
his
wealthy
widow
!
<EOS>
indeed
,
for
a
woman
want
a
husband
of
that
sort
,
Captain
Bellfield
be
a
safe
venture
than
would
be
a
man
of
a
high
standing
among
his
creditor
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
Bellfield
may
have
be
a
forger
,
or
a
thief
,
or
a
return
convict
,
 
but
then
his
debt
could
not
be
large
.
<EOS>
let
him
have
do
his
good
,
he
could
not
have
obtain
credit
for
a
thousand
pound
;
whereas
,
no
one
could
tell
the
liability
of
a
gentleman
of
high
standing
.
<EOS>
Burgo
Fitzgerald
be
a
gentleman
of
high
standing
,
and
his
creditor
would
have
swallow
up
every
shilling
that
Mrs.
Greenow
possess
;
but
with
Captain
Bellfield
she
be
comparatively
safe
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
I
think
that
she
be
lucky
in
her
choice
;
or
,
perhaps
,
I
may
more
truly
say
,
that
she
have
choose
with
prudence
.
<EOS>
He
be
no
forger
,
or
thief
 
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
;
nor
be
he
a
return
convict
.
<EOS>
He
be
simply
an
idle
scamp
,
who
have
hang
about
the
world
for
forty
year
,
do
nothing
,
without
principle
,
shameless
,
accustomed
to
eat
dirty
pudding
,
and
to
be
kick
 
morally
kick
 
by
such
man
as
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
moderate
in
his
greediness
,
and
possess
of
a
certain
appreciation
of
the
comfort
of
a
daily
dinner
,
which
may
possibly
suffice
to
keep
him
from
stray
very
wide
as
long
as
his
intend
wife
should
be
able
to
keep
the
purse
-
string
altogether
in
her
own
hand
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
I
say
that
Mrs.
Greenow
have
be
lucky
in
her
choice
,
and
not
altogether
without
prudence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
of
take
this
house
,
"
say
she
,
"
and
of
live
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
,
in
Westmoreland
!
"
say
the
Captain
,
with
something
of
dismay
in
his
tone
.
<EOS>
what
on
earth
would
he
do
with
himself
all
his
life
in
that
gloomy
place
!
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
in
Westmoreland
.
<EOS>
why
not
in
Westmoreland
as
well
as
anywhere
else
?
<EOS>
if
you
do
not
like
Westmoreland
,
it
be
not
too
late
yet
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
answer
to
this
the
poor
Captain
be
oblige
to
declare
that
he
have
no
objection
whatever
to
Westmoreland
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
talk
to
my
niece
about
it
,
"
continue
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
and
I
find
that
such
an
arrangement
can
be
make
very
conveniently
.
<EOS>
the
property
be
leave
between
her
and
her
uncle
,
 
the
father
of
my
other
niece
,
and
neither
of
them
want
to
live
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
will
not
you
be
rather
dull
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
could
go
to
Yarmouth
,
you
know
,
in
the
autumn
.
"
<EOS>
then
the
Captain
's
visage
become
somewhat
bright
again
.
"
<EOS>
and
perhaps
,
if
you
be
not
extravagant
,
we
could
manage
a
month
or
so
in
London
during
the
winter
,
just
to
see
the
play
and
do
a
little
shopping
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
the
Captain
's
face
become
very
bright
.
<EOS>
"
that
will
be
delightful
,
"
say
he
.
"
<EOS>
and
as
for
be
dull
,
"
say
the
widow
,
"
when
people
grow
old
they
must
be
dull
.
<EOS>
dancing
can
not
go
on
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
answer
to
this
the
widow
's
Captain
assure
the
widow
that
she
be
not
at
all
old
;
and
now
,
on
this
occasion
,
that
ceremony
come
off
successfully
which
have
be
interrupt
on
the
Shap
road
by
the
noise
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
wheel
.
<EOS>
"
there
go
my
cap
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
what
a
goose
you
be
!
<EOS>
what
will
Jeannette
say
?
"
<EOS>
"
Bother
Jeannette
,
"
say
the
Captain
in
his
bliss
.
<EOS>
"
She
can
do
another
cap
,
and
many
more
will
not
be
want
.
<EOS>
"
then
I
think
the
ceremony
be
repeat
.
  
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
the
Captain
's
visit
be
satisfactory
 
at
any
rate
to
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
everything
be
settle
.
<EOS>
He
be
to
go
away
on
Saturday
morning
,
and
remain
in
lodging
at
Penrith
till
the
wedding
,
which
they
agree
to
have
celebrate
at
Vavasor
Church
.
<EOS>
Kate
promise
to
be
the
solitary
bridesmaid
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
talk
of
send
for
Charlie
Fairstairs
,
but
the
idea
be
abandon
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
have
her
afterwards
,
"
say
the
widow
to
Kate
,
"
when
you
be
go
,
and
we
shall
want
her
more
.
<EOS>
and
I
will
get
Cheesacre
here
,
and
make
him
marry
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
good
in
pay
for
two
journey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Captain
be
to
be
allow
to
come
over
from
Penrith
twice
a
week
previous
to
his
marriage
;
or
perhaps
,
I
may
more
fairly
say
,
that
he
be
command
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
he
feel
when
Mrs.
Greenow
give
him
his
first
five
-
pound
note
,
and
tell
him
that
he
must
make
it
do
for
a
fortnight
?
 
<EOS>
whether
it
be
all
joy
,
or
whether
there
be
about
his
heart
any
touch
of
manly
regret
?
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Bellfield

of
Vavasor
Hall

<EOS>
It
do
not

badly

he
say
to
himself
,
as
he
travel
away
on

journey
to

Lady
Monk
's
Plan

<EOS>
on
the
night
of
Lady
Monk
's
party
,
Burgo
Fitzgerald
disappear
;
and
when
the
guest
be
go
and
the
room
be
empty
,
his
aunt
inquire
for
him
in
vain
.
<EOS>
the
old
butler
and
factotum
of
the

,
who
be
employ
by
Sir
Cosmo
to
put
out
the
lamp
and
to
see
that
he
be
not
rob
beyond
a
certain
point
on
these
occasion
of
his
wife
's
triumph
,
be
interrogate
by
his
mistress
,
and
say
that
he
think
Mr.
Burgo
have
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
herself
knock
at
her
nephew

door
,
when
she
go
up

stair
,
ascend
an
additional
flight
of
stair
with
her
weary
old
limb
in
order
that
she
may
do
so
;
she
even
open
the
door
and
see
the
careless
debris
of
his
toilet
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
go
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
perhaps
,
after
all
,
he
have
arrange
it
,
"
she
say
to
herself
,
as
she
go
down
to
her
own
room

<EOS>
but
Burgo
,
as
we
know
,
have
not
"
arrange
it
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
remember
that
when
Mr.
Palliser
come
back
to
his
wife
in
the
supper
-
room
at
Lady
Monk
's
,
bring
with
him
the
scarf
which
Lady
Glencora
have
leave
up
-
stair
,
Burgo
be
no
longer
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
have
become
well
aware
that
he
have
no
chance
leave
,
at
any
rate
for
that
night
.
<EOS>
the
poor
fool
,
act
upon
his
aunt
's
imply
advice
rather
than
his
own
hope
,
have
secure
a
post
-
chaise
,
and
station
it
in
Bruton
Street
,
some
five
minute
"
walk
from
his
aunt
's
house

<EOS>
and
he
have
purchase
feminine
wrapping
,
cloak
,
&
c.
 
thing
that
he
think
may
be
necessary
for
his
companion
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
too
,
order
room
at
the
new
hotel
near
the
Dover
Station
,
 
the
London
Bridge
Station
,
 
from
whence
be
to
start
on
the
follow
morning
a
train
to
catch
the
tidal
boat
for
Boulogne
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
dressing
-
bag
there
for
which
he
have
pay
twenty
-
five
guinea
out
of
his
aunt
's
money
,
not
have
be
able
to
induce
the
tradesman
to
grant
it
to
him
on
credit

and
there
be
other
thing
,
 
slipper

collar

stocking

handkerchief

what
else

may

<EOS>
poor

thoughtless
fool

<EOS>
the
butler
be
right
.
<EOS>
He
do
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
see
Lady
Glencora
take
to
her
carriage
from
some
back
hiding
-
place
in
the
hall
,
and
then
slip
out
,
unmindful
of
his
shine
boot
,
and
dress
coat
and
jewel
stud
.
<EOS>
He
take
a
Gibus
hat
,
 
his
own
,
or
that
of
some
other
unfortunate
,
 
and
slowly
make
his
way
down
to
the
place
in
Bruton
Street
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
carriage
and
pair
of
horse
,
all
in
readiness
;
and
the
driver
,
when
he
have
place
himself
by
the
door
of
the
vehicle
,
be
not
long
in
emerge
from
the
neighbour
public

"
all
ready

"
I

hoarsely
;

about

no

.
<EOS>
I
shall
want
them
and
another
carriage
in
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
he
give
the
man
half
a
sovereign
,
and
go
away
,
not
look
at
the
little
treasure
which
he
have
spend
so
much
of
his
money
in
select
for
his
love
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
go
,
the
waterman
and
the
driver
turn
them
over
with
careful
hand
and
gloat
eye
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
"
eiress
,
I
will
go
bail
,
"
say
the
waterman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
pretty
dear
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
her
parint
be
too
many
for
her
,
"
say
the
driver
.
<EOS>
but
neither
of
them
imagine
the
enormity
which
the
hirer
of
the
chaise
have
in
truth
contemplate
.
  
<EOS>
Burgo
from
thence
take
his
way
back
into
Grosvenor
Square
,
and
from
thence
down
Park
Street
,
and
through
a
narrow
passage
and
a
mews
which
there
be
in
those
part
,
into
Park
Lane
.
<EOS>
He
have
now
pass
the
position
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
house
,
have
come
out
on
Park
Lane
at
a
spot
nearer
to
piccadilly
;
but
he
retrace
his
step
,
walk
along
by
the
rail
of
the
Park
,
till
he
find
himself
opposite
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
then
he
stand
there
,
lean
back
upon
the
railing
,
and
look
up
at
Lady
Glencora
's
window
.
<EOS>
what
do
he
expect
to
see
?
<EOS>
or
be
he
,
in
truth
,
move
by
love
of
that
kind
which
can
take
joy
in
watch
the
slight
shadow
that
be
make
by
the
one
loved
object
,
 
<EOS>
that
may
be
make
by
her
,
or
,
by
some
violent
conjecture
of
the
mind
,
may
be
suppose
to
have
be
so
make
?
<EOS>
such
love
as
that
is
,
I
think
,
always
innocent
.
<EOS>
Burgo
Fitzgerald
do
not
love
like
that
.
<EOS>
I
almost
doubt
whether
he
can
be
say
to
have
love
at
all
.
<EOS>
there
be
in
his
breast
a
mixed
,
feverish
desire
,
which
he
take
no
trouble
to
analyse
.
<EOS>
He
want
money
.
<EOS>
He
want
the
thing
of
which
this
Palliser
have
rob
him
.
<EOS>
He
want
revenge
,
 
though
his
desire
for
that
be
not
a
burn
desire
.
<EOS>
and
among
other
thing
,
he
want
the
woman
's
beauty
of
the
woman
whom
he
covet
.
<EOS>
He
want
to
kiss
her
again
as
he
have
once
kiss
her
,
and
to
feel
that
she
be
soft
,
and
lovely
,
and
love
for
him
.
<EOS>
but
as
for
see
her
shadow
,
unless
its
movement
indicate
some
purpose
in
his
favour
,
 
I
do
not
think
that
he
care
much
about
that
.
  
<EOS>
and
why
then
be
he
there
?
<EOS>
because
in
his
unreasone
folly
he
do
not
know
what
step
to
take
,
or
what
step
not
to
take
.
<EOS>
there
be
man
whose
energy
hardly
ever
carry
them
beyond
look
for
the
thing
they
want
.
<EOS>
She
may
see
him
from
the
window
,
and
come
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
that
he
think
that
it
would
be
so
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
that
he
never
think
at
all
about
that
or
about
anything
.
<EOS>
if
you
lie
under
a
tree
,
and
open
your
mouth
,
a
plum
may
fall
into
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
probably
an
undefined
idea
of
some
such
chance
as
this
which
bring
him
against
the
railing
in
the
front
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
house
;
that
,
and
a
feeling
make
up
partly
of
despair
and
partly
of
linger
romance
that
he
be
well
there
,
out
in
the
night
air
,
under
the
gas
-
lamp
,
than
he
could
be
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
there
he
stand
and
look
,
and
curse
his
ill
-
luck
.
<EOS>
but
his
curse
have
none
of
the
bitterness
of
those
which
George
Vavasor
be
always
utter
.
<EOS>
through
it
all
there
remain
about
Burgo
one
honest
feeling
,
 
one
conviction
that
be
true
,
 
a
feeling
that
it
all
serve
him
right
,
and
that
he
have
well
,
perhaps
,
go
to
the
devil
at
once
,
and
give
nobody
any
more
trouble
.
<EOS>
if
he
love
no
one
sincerely
,
neither
do
he
hate
any
one
;
and
whenever
he
make
any
self
-
inquiry
into
his
own
circumstance
,
he
always
tell
himself
that
it
be
all
his
own
fault
.
<EOS>
when
he
curse
his
fate
,
he
only
do
so
because
cursing
be
so
easy
.
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
would
have
grind
his
victim
up
to
powder
if
he
know
how
;
but
Burgo
Fitzgerald
desire
to
hurt
no
one
.
  
<EOS>
there
he
stand
till
he
be
cold
,
and
then
,
as
the
plum
do
not
drop
into
his
mouth
,
he
move
on
.
<EOS>
He
go
up
into
Oxford
Street
,
and
walk
along
it
the
whole
distance
to
the
corner
of
Bond
Street
,
pass
by
Grosvenor
Square
,
to
which
he
intend
to
return
.
<EOS>
at
the
corner
of
Bond
Street
,
a
girl
take
hold
of
him
,
and
look
up
into
his
face
.
"
<EOS>
ah
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
"
I
see
you
once
before
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
see
the
most
miserable
devil
alive
,
"
say
Burgo
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
be
miserable
,
"
say
the
girl
.
<EOS>
"
what
make
you
miserable
?
<EOS>
You
have
plenty
of
money
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
have
,
"
say
Burgo
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
,
"
exclaim
the
girl
;
"
and
you
be
so
handsome
!
<EOS>
I
remember
you
.
<EOS>
You
give
me
supper
one
night
when
I
be
starve
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
hungry
now
.
<EOS>
Will
you
give
me
a
kiss
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
give
you
a
shilling
,
and
that
be
well
,
"
say
Burgo
.
<EOS>
"
but
give
me
a
kiss
too
,
"
say
the
girl
.
<EOS>
He
give
her
first
the
kiss
,
and
then
the
shilling
,
and
after
that
he
leave
her
and
pass
on
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
d
 
---
d
if
I
would
not
change
with
her
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
anything
really
ail
him
?
"
think
the
girl
.
"
<EOS>
He
say
he
be
wretched
before
.
<EOS>
Should
not
I
like
to
be
good
to
such
a
one
as
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Burgo
go
on
,
and
make
his
way
into
the
house
in
Grosvenor
Square
,
by
some
mean
probably
unknown
to
his
aunt
,
and
certainly
unknown
to
his
uncle
.
<EOS>
He
empty
his
pocket
as
he
get
into
bed
,
and
count
a
roll
of
note
which
he
have
keep
in
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
still
a
hundred
and
thirty
pound
leave
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
have
promise
that
she
would
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
She
have
say
as
much
as
that
quite
distinctly
.
<EOS>
but
what
use
would
there
be
in
that
if
all
his
money
should
then
be
go
?
<EOS>
He
know
that
the
keeping
of
money
in
his
pocket
be
to
him
quite
an
impossibility
.
<EOS>
then
he
think
of
his
aunt
.
<EOS>
what
should
he
say
to
his
aunt
if
he
see
her
in
the
course
of
the
coming
day
?
<EOS>
may
it
not
be
as
well
for
him
to
avoid
his
aunt
altogether
?
  
<EOS>
He
breakfast
up
-
stair
in
his
bedroom
,
 
in
the
bed
,
indeed
,
eat
a
small
paté
de
foie
gras
from
the
supper
-
table
,
as
he
read
a
french
novel
.
<EOS>
there
he
be
still
read
his
french
novel
in
bed
when
his
aunt
's
maid
come
to
him
,
say
that
his
aunt
wish
to
see
him
before
she
go
out
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
tell
me
,
Lucy
,
"
say
he
,
"
how
be
the
old
girl
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
as
cross
as
cross
,
Mr.
Burgo
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
shall
not
;
 
not
a
minute
longer
.
<EOS>
do
not
,
now
;
will
you
?
<EOS>
I
tell
you
she
be
wait
for
me
.
"
<EOS>
from
which
it
may
be
see
that
Lucy
share
the
general
feminine
feeling
in
favour
of
poor
Burgo
.
  
<EOS>
thus
summon
Burgo
apply
himself
to
his
toilet
;
but
as
he
do
so
,
he
recruit
his
energy
from
time
to
time
by
a
few
page
of
the
french
novel
,
and
also
by
small
dose
from
a
bottle
of
curaçoa
which
he
have
in
his
bedroom
.
<EOS>
He
be
utterly
a
pauper
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
pauper
poor
than
he
in
London
that
day
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
breakfast
on
paté
de
foie
gras
and
curaçoa
,
and
regard
those
dainty
very
much
as
other
man
regard
bread
and
cheese
and
beer
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
he
be
dress
at
the
summon
of
his
aunt
,
he
have
by
no
mean
make
up
his
mind
that
he
would
go
to
her
.
<EOS>
why
should
he
go
to
her
?
<EOS>
what
good
would
it
do
him
?
<EOS>
She
would
not
give
him
more
money
.
<EOS>
She
would
only
scold
him
for
his
misconduct
.
<EOS>
She
may
,
perhaps
,
turn
him
out
of
the
house
if
he
do
not
obey
her
,
 
or
attempt
to
do
so
;
but
she
would
be
much
more
likely
to
do
this
when
he
have
make
her
angry
by
contradict
her
.
<EOS>
in
neither
case
would
he
leave
the
house
,
even
though
its
further
use
be
positively
forbid
him
,
because
his
remain
there
be
convenient
;
but
as
he
could
gain
nothing
by
see
"
the
old
girl
,
"
as
he
have
call
her
,
he
resolve
to
escape
to
his
club
without
attend
to
her
summon
.
  
<EOS>
but
his
aunt
,
who
be
a
better
general
than
he
,
out
-
manoeuvre
him
.
<EOS>
He
creep
down
the
back
stair
;
but
as
he
could
not
quite
condescend
to
escape
through
the
area
,
he
be
force
to
emerge
upon
the
hall
,
and
here
his
aunt
pounce
upon
him
,
come
out
of
the
breakfast
-
parlour
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
Lucy
tell
you
that
I
want
to
see
you
?
"
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
ask
,
with
severity
in
her
voice
.
  
<EOS>
Burgo
reply
,
with
perfect
ease
,
that
he
be
go
out
just
to
have
his
hair
wash
and
brush
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
be
back
in
twenty
minute
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
energy
about
the
poor
fellow
,
unless
,
perhaps
,
when
he
be
hunt
;
but
he
possess
a
readiness
which
enable
him
to
lie
at
a
moment
's
notice
with
the
most
perfect
ease
.
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
do
not
believe
him
;
but
she
could
not
confute
him
,
and
therefore
she
let
the
lie
pass
.
  
<EOS>
"
never
mind
your
hair
now
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
come
in
here
for
a
few
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
there
be
no
way
of
escape
leave
to
him
,
he
follow
his
aunt
into
the
breakfast
-
parlour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Burgo
,
"
she
say
,
when
she
have
seat
herself
,
and
have
make
him
sit
in
a
chair
opposite
to
her
,
"
I
do
not
think
you
will
ever
do
any
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
much
think
I
shall

aunt

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
,
then
,
to
do
with
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
 
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
think
much
about
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
stay
here
in
this
house

<EOS>
Sir
Cosmo
be
speak
to
me
about
you
only
yesterday
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
quite
willing
to
go
down
to
Monkshade
,
if
Sir
Cosmo
like
it
better
;
 
that
is
,
when
the
season
be
a
little
more
through
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
not
have
you
at
Monkshade
.
<EOS>
He
will
not
let
you
go
there
again
.
<EOS>
and
he
will
not
have
you
here
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
you
be
turn
what
I

into
joke

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

indeed
,
aunt
,
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
you
be
;
 
you
know
you
be
.
<EOS>
You
be
the
most
ungrateful
,
heartless
creature
I
ever
meet
.
<EOS>
You
must
make
up
your
mind
to
leave
this
house
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
do
Sir
Cosmo
mean
that
I
should
go
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
to
the
workhouse
,
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
suppose
he
do
;
 
the
least
in
the
world
,
"
say
Burgo
,
open
his
eye
,
and
stretch
his
nostril
,
and
look
into
his
aunt
's
face
as
though
he
have
great
ground
for
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
turning
of
Burgo
out
of
the
house
be
not
Lady
Monk
's
immediate
purpose
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
he
would
hang
on
there
till
the
season
be
over
.
<EOS>
after
that
he
must
not
be
allow
to
return
again
,
unless
he
should
have
succeed
in
a
certain
enterprise
.
<EOS>
She
have
now
catch
him
in
order
that
she
may
learn
whether
there
be
any
possible
remain
chance
of
success
as
to
that
enterprise
.
<EOS>
so
she
receive
his
indignation
in
silence
,
and
begin
upon
another
subject
.
<EOS>
"
what
a
fool
you
make
of
yourself
last
night
,
Burgo
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
I
;
 
more
of
a
fool
than
usual
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
believe
that
you
will
never
be
serious
about
anything

<EOS>
why
do
you
go
on
waltz
in

way

every

I

<EOS>
"
look
here

I

for

no

You

you

You

just
able
to
amuse
itself
for
the
moment

never
can
think
of
anything
further

<EOS>
You
simply
disgrace
yourself
last
night
,

me
too

her
;

,
of
course
,
you
care
nothing
about
that

I
have
a

only
he

when

send
him
word
how
you

go
on

now
he
will
have
forgive
her

of
course

the
thing
will
be
all
over

<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
,
aunt

she
would
go
if

know
how

when
I
be
force
to
leave
her
last
night

she
promise
to
see
me
again

<EOS>
and
as
for
be
idle
,
and
not
do
anything
;
 
why
,
I
be
out
in
Park
Lane
last
night
,
after
you
be
in
bed

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
good
do
that
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
do
not
do
any
good
,
as
it
happen

<EOS>
but
a
fellow
can
only
try
.
<EOS>
I
believe
,
after
all
,
it
would
be
easy
down
in
the
country
,
 
especially
now
that
he
have
take
it
into
his
head
to
look
after
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
sit
silent
for
a
few
moment
,
and
then
she
say
in
a
low
voice
,
"
what
do
she
say
to
you
when
you
be
part
?
<EOS>
what
be
her
exact
word
?
"
<EOS>
She
,
at
any
rate
,
be
not
deficient
in
energy
.
<EOS>
She
be
anxious
enough
to
see
her
purpose
accomplish
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
conduct
the
matter
with
discretion
,
if
the
run
away
with
Mr.
Palliser
's
wife
could
,
in
very
fact
,
have
be
do
by
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
say
she
would
see
me
again
.
<EOS>
She
promise
it
twice
.
"
  
"
and
be
that
all
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
could
she
say
more
,
when
she
be
force
to
go
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
she
say
that
she
would
go
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
ask
her
,
 
half
a
dozen
time
,
and
she
do
not
once
refuse
.
<EOS>
I
know
she
mean
it
,
if
she
know
how
to
get
away
.
<EOS>
She
hate
him
;
 
I
be
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
a
woman
,
you
know

would
not
absolutely
say
that
she
would
go
,
till
she
be
go

"
  
<EOS>
"
if
she
really
mean
it
,
she
would
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
she
could
have
tell
me
plainer

<EOS>
She
say
she
would
see
me
again

<EOS>
She
say
that
twice
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
Lady
Monk
sit
silent
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
plan
in
her
head
,
 
a
plan
that
may
,
as
she
think
,
give
to
her
nephew
one
more
chance
.
<EOS>
but
she
hesitate
before
she
could
bring
herself
to
explain
it
in
detail
.
<EOS>
at
first
she
have
lend
a
little
aid
to
this
desire
abduction
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
wife
,
but
in
lend
it
have
say
no
word
upon
the
subject
.
<EOS>
during
the
last
season
she
have
succeed
in
get
Lady
Glencora
to
her
house
in
London
,
and
have
take
care
that
Burgo
should
meet
her
there
.
<EOS>
then
a
hint
or
two
have
be
speak
,
and
Lady
Glencora
have
be
ask
to
Monkshade
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
as
we
know
,
do
not
go
to
Monkshade
,
and
Lady
Monk
have
then
be
baffle
.
<EOS>
but
she
do
not
therefore
give
up
the
game
.
<EOS>
have
now
think
of
it
so
much
,
she
begin
to
speak
of
it
more
boldly
,
and
have
procure
money
for
her
nephew
that
he
may
thereby
be
enable
to
carry
off
the
woman
.
<EOS>
but
though
this
have
be
well
understand
between
them
,
though
word
have
be
speak
which
be
sufficiently
explicit
,
the
plan
have
not
be
openly
discuss
.
<EOS>
Lady
Monk
have
know
nothing
of
the
mode
in
which
Lady
Glencora
be
to
have
be
carry
off
after
her
party
,
nor
whither
<EOS>
she
be
to
have
be
take
.
<EOS>
but
now
,
 
now
she
must
arrange
it
herself
,
and
have
a
scheme
of
her
own
,
or
else
<EOS>
the
thing
must
fail
absolutely
.
<EOS>
even
she
be
almost
reluctant
to
speak
out
plainly
to
her
nephew
on
such
a
subject
.
<EOS>
what
if
he
should
be
false
to
her
,
and
tell
of
her
?
<EOS>
but
when
a
woman
have
make
such
scheme
,
nothing
distress
her
so
sadly
as
their
failure
.
<EOS>
She
would
risk
all
rather
than
that
Mr.
Palliser
should
keep
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
and
help
you
,
"
she
say
at
last
,
speak
hoarsely
,
almost
in
a
whisper
,
"
if
you
have
courage
to
make
an
attempt
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
courage
!
"
say
he
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
<EOS>
you
think
I
be
afraid
of
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
?
<EOS>
I
would
fight
him
,
 
or
all
the
Pallisers
,
one
after
another
,
if
it
would
do
any
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
fighting
!
<EOS>
there
be
no
fighting
want
,
as
you
know
well
enough
.
<EOS>
man
do
not
fight
nowadays
.
<EOS>
look
here
!
<EOS>
if
you
can
get
her
to
call
here
some
day
,
 
say
on
Thursday
,
at
three
o'clock
,
 
I
will
be
here
to
receive
her
;
and
instead
of
go
back
into
her
carriage
,
you
can
have
a
cab
for
her
somewhere
near
.
<EOS>
She
can
come
,
as
it
be
,
to
make
a
morning
call
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
cab
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
a
cab
will
not
kill
her
,
and
it
be
less
easily
follow
than
a
carriage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
where
shall
we
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
train
to
Southampton
at
four
,
and
the
boat
sail
for
Jersey
at
half
-
past
six
;
you
will
be
in
Jersey
the
next
morning
,
and
there
be
a
boat
go
on
to
St.
Malo
,
almost
at
once
.
<EOS>
You
can
go
direct
from
one
boat
to
the
other
,
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
if
she
have
strength
and
courage
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
after
that
,
who
will
say
that
Lady
Monk
be
not
a
devoted
aunt
?
  
<EOS>
"
that
would
do
excellently
well
,
"
say
the
enraptured
Burgo
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
have
difficulty
in
get
away
from
me
,
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
shall
say
nothing
about
it
,
and
shall
know
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
better
tell
her
coachman
to
drive
somewhere
to
pick
some
one
up
,
and
to
return
;
 
out
somewhere
to
Tyburnia
,
or
down
to
Pimlico
.
<EOS>
then
she
can
leave
me
,
and
go
out
on
foot
,
to
where
you
have
the
cab
.
<EOS>
She
can
tell
the
hall
-
porter
that
she
will
walk
to
her
carriage
.
<EOS>
do
you
understand
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Burgo
declare
that
he
do
understand
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
call
on
her
,
and
make
your
way
in
,
and
see
her
,
and
arrange
all
this
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
a
Thursday
,
because
of
the
boat
.
<EOS>
"
then
she
make
inquiry
about
his
money
,
and
take
from
him
the
note
which
he
have
,
promise
to
return
them
,
with
something
add
,
on
the
Thursday
morning
;
but
he
ask
,
with
a
little
whine
,
for
a
five
-
pound
note
,
and
get
it
.
<EOS>
Burgo
then
tell
her
about
the
travelling
-
bag
and
the
stocking
,
and
they
be
quite
pleasant
and
confidential
.
<EOS>
"
bid
her
come
in
a
stout
travelling
-
dress
,
"
say
Lady
Monk
.
<EOS>
"
She
can
wear
some
lace
or
something
over
it
,
so
that
the
servant
will
not
observe
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
no
notice
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
be
there
ever
such
an
aunt
?
  
<EOS>
after
this
,
Burgo
leave
his
aunt
,
and
go
away
to
his
club
,
in
a
state
of
most
happy
excitement
.
   
<EOS>
the
last
Kiss
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
,
on
her
return
from
Westmoreland
,
go
direct
to
Park
Lane
,
whither
Lady
Glencora
and
Mr.
Palliser
have
also
return
before
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
to
remain
with
them
in
London
one
entire
day
,
and
on
the
morning
after
that
they
be
to
start
for
Paris
.
<EOS>
She
find
Mr.
Palliser
in
close
attendance
upon
his
wife
.
<EOS>
not
that
there
be
anything
in
his
manner
which
at
all
imply
that
he
be
keep
watch
over
her
,
or
that
he
be
more
with
her
,
or
close
to
her
than
a
love
husband
may
wish
to
be
with
a
young
wife
;
but
the
mode
of
life
be
very
different
from
that
which
Alice
have
see
at
Matching
Priory
!
  
<EOS>
on
her
arrival
Mr.
Palliser
himself
receive
her
in
the
hall
,
and
take
her
up
to
his
wife
before
she
have
take
off
her
travel
hat
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
so
much
oblige
to
you
,
Miss
Vavasor
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
it
quite
as
deeply
as
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
"
she
say
;
"
it
be
I
that
be
under
obligation
to
you
for
take
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
merely
smile
,
and
shake
his
head
,
and
then
take
her
up
-
stair
.
<EOS>
on
the
stair
he
say
one
other
word
to
her
:
"
You
must
forgive
me
if
I
be
cross
to
you
<EOS>
that
night
she
go
out
among
the
ruin
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
mutter
something
,
 
some
little
fib
of
courtesy
as
to
the
matter
have
be
forget
,
or
never
borne
in
mind
;
and
then
they
go
on
to
Lady
Glencora
's
room
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
Alice
that
he
be
not
so
big
or
so
much
to
be
dread
as
when
she
have
see
him
at
Matching
.
<EOS>
His
descent
from
an
expectant
,
or
more
than
an
expectant
,
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
down
to
a
simple
,
attentive
husband
,
seem
to
affect
his
gait
,
his
voice
,
and
all
his
demeanour
.
<EOS>
when
he
receive
Alice
at
the
Priory
he
certainly
loom
before
her
as
something
great
,
whereas
now
his
greatness
seem
to
have
fall
from
him
.
<EOS>
We
must
own
that
this
be
hard
upon
him
,
see
that
the
deed
by
which
he
have
divest
himself
of
his
greatness
have
be
so
pure
and
good
!
  
<EOS>
"
dear
Alice
,
this
be
so
good
of
you
!
<EOS>
I
be
all
in
the
midst
of
packing
,
and
Plantagenet
be
help
me
.
"
<EOS>
Plantagenet
wince
a
little
under
this
,
as
the
hero
of
old
must
have
wince
when
he
be
find
with
the
distaff
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
have
relinquish
his
sword
of
state
for
the
distaff
which
he
have
assume
,
and
could
take
no
glory
in
the
change
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
too
,
in
his
wife
's
voice
the
slight
hint
of
mockery
,
which
,
slight
as
it
be
,
he
perhaps
think
she
may
have
spare
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
nothing
leave
to
pack
,
"
continue
Glencora
,
"
and
I
do
not
know
what
you
can
do
to
amuse
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
help
you
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
we
have
so
very
nearly
do
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
shall
have
to
pull
all
the
thing
out
,
and
put
them
up
again
,
or
we
shall
never
get
through
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
We
could
not
start
to
-
morrow
;
 
could
we
,
Plantagenet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
very
well
,
as
your
room
be
order
in
Paris
for
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
if
we
could
not
find
room
at
every
inn
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
man
be
so
particular
.
<EOS>
now
in
travel
I
should
like
never
to
order
room
,
 
never
to
know
where
I
be
go
or
when
I
be
go
,
and
to
carry
everything
I
want
in
a
market
-
basket
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
who
by
this
time
have
follow
her
friend
along
the
passage
to
her
bedroom
,
and
have
see
how
widely
the
package
be
spread
about
,
bethought
herself
that
the
market
-
basket
should
be
a
large
one
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
would
never
travel
among
Christians
.
<EOS>
Christians
be
so
slow
,
and
they
wear
chimney
-
pot
hat
everywhere
.
<EOS>
the
further
one
go
from
London
among
Christians
,
the
more
they
wear
chimney
-
pot
hat
.
<EOS>
I
want
Plantagenet
to
take
us
to
see
the
Kurds
,
but
he
will
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
that
would
be
fair
to
Miss
Vavasor
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
have
follow
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
put
the
blame
on
her
head
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
woman
have
always
pluck
for
anything
.
<EOS>
Would
not
you
like
to
see
a
live
Kurd
,
Alice
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
exactly
know
where
they
live
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
nor
I.
I
have
not
the
remote
idea
of
the
way
to
the
Kurds
.
<EOS>
You
see
my
joke
,
do
not
you
,
though
Plantagenet
do
not
?
<EOS>
but
one
know
that
they
be
Eastern
,
and
the
East
be
such
a
grand
idea
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
we
will
content
ourselves
with
Rome
,
or
perhaps
Naples
,
on
this
occasion
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
the
notion
of
Lady
Glencora
pack
anything
for
herself
be
as
good
a
joke
as
that
other
one
of
the
Kurds
and
whey
.
<EOS>
but
she
go
flit
about
from
room
to
room
,
declare
that
this
thing
must
be
take
,
and
that
other
,
till
the
market
-
basket
would
have
become
very
large
indeed
.
<EOS>
Alice
be
astonish
at
the
extent
of
the
preparation
,
and
the
sort
of
equipage
with
which
they
be
about
to
travel
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
be
take
her
own
carriage
.
<EOS>
"
not
that
I
shall
ever
use
it
,
"
she
say
to
Alice
,
"
but
he
insist
upon
it
,
to
show
that
I
be
not
suppose
to
be
take
away
in
disgrace
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
good
;
 
be
not
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
good
,
"
say
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
no
one
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
so
dull
!
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
fancy
that
all
husband
be
dull
from
the
nature
of
their
position

if
I
be
a
young
woman
's
husband

I
should
not

what
to

be
not
dull

"
  
<EOS>
two
woman
and
two
man
servant
be
to
be
take
.
<EOS>
Alice
have
receive
permission
to
bring
her
own
maid
 
"
or
a
dozen
,
if
you
want
them
,
"
Lady
Glencora
have
say
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
in
his
present
mood
would
think
nothing
too
much
to
do
for
you
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
to
ask
him
to
go
among
the
Kurds
,
he
would
go
at
once
;
 
or
on
to
Crim
Tartary
,
if
you
make
a
point
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
but
as
both
Lady
Glencora
's
servant
speak
French
,
and
as
her
own
do
not
,
Alice
trust
herself
in
that
respect
to
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
one
all
to
yourself
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
take
two
for
the
same
reason
that
I
take
the
carriage
,
 
just
as
you
let
a
child
go
out
in
her
good
frock
,
for
a
treat
,
after
you
have
scold
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
when
Alice
ask
why
it
be
suppose
that
Mr.
Palliser
be
so
specially
devoted
to
her
,
the
thing
be
explain
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
dear
,
I
have
tell
him
everything
.
<EOS>
I
always
do
tell
everything

<EOS>
nobody
can
say
I
be
not
candid

<EOS>
He
know
about
your
not
let
me
come
to
your
house
in
the
old
day
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Alice
!
 
<EOS>
you
be
wrong
then
;
I
shall
always
say
that
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
do
and
go
;
and
thing
that
be
do
and
go
shall
be
do
and
go
for
me

and
I
tell
him
all
that
you
say

about
<EOS>
you
know
what

<EOS>
I
have
have
nothing
else
to
do

make
confession
for
the
last
ten
day

when
a
woman
once
begin
,
the
more
she
confess
the
well

I
tell
him

you
refuse
Jeffrey

You
do
not

<EOS>
"
I
do
indeed

he
like
you
the
well
for
that

<EOS>
I
think
he
would
let
Jeffrey
marry
you
now
if
you
both
wish
it
;
 
and
then
,
<EOS>
oh
dear
!

supposing
that

adopt
it

Cora

when
we
once
get
to
Paris
.
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
<EOS>
you
should
not
grudge
me
my
little
naughtiness
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
so
proper
for
the
last
ten
day
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
I
get
into
a
way
of
drive
Dandy
and
Flirt
at
the
rate
of
six
mile
an
hour
,
till
I
be
sure
the
poor
beast
think
they
be
always
go
to
a
funeral
.
<EOS>
poor
dandy
and
poor
Flirt
!
<EOS>
I
shall
not
see
them
now
for
another
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
on
the
follow
morning
they
breakfast
early
,
because
Mr.
Palliser
have
get
into
an
early
habit
.
<EOS>
He
have
say
that
early
hour
would
be
good
for
them
.
"
<EOS>
but
he
never
tell
me
why
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
pleasant
when
people
be
travel
,
"
say
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
that
,
"
her
cousin
answer
;
"
but
we
be
all
to
be
such
particularly
good
child
.
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
fair
,
because
he
go
to
sleep
last
night
after
dinner
while
you
and
I
keep
ourselves
awake
:
but
we
need
not
do
that
another
night
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
after
breakfast
they
all
three
go
to
work
to
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
It
be
ludicrous
and
almost
painful
to
see
Mr.
Palliser
wander
about
and
count
the
box
,
as
though
he
could
do
any
good
by
that
.
<EOS>
at
this
special
crisis
of
his
life
he
hate
his
paper
and
figure
and
statistic
,
and
could
not
apply
himself
to
them
.
<EOS>
He
,
whose
application
have
be
so
unremitting
,
could
apply
himself
now
to
nothing
.
<EOS>
His
world
have
be
bring
to
an
abrupt
end
,
and
he
be
awkward
at
make
a
new
beginning
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
they
all
three
be
read
novel
before
one
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
and
Alice
have
determine
that
they
would
not
leave
the
house
throughout
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
nothing
have
be
say
about
it
,
but
I
regard
it
as
part
of
the
bond
that
I
be
not
to
go
out
anywhere
.
<EOS>
who
know
but
what
I
may
be
find
in
Gloucester
Square
?
<EOS>
"
there
be
,
however
,
no
absolute
necessity
that
Mr.
Palliser
should
remain
with
them
;
and
,
at
about
three
,
he
prepare
himself
for
a
solitary
walk
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
go
down
to
the
House
.
<EOS>
all
interest
in
the
House
be
over
with
him
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
Speaker
's
leave
to
absent
himself
for
the
season
.
<EOS>
nor
would
he
call
on
anyone
.
<EOS>
all
his
friend
know
,
or
believe
they
know
,
that
he
have
leave
town
.
<EOS>
His
death
and
burial
have
be
already
chronicle
,
and
be
he
now
to
reappear
,
he
could
reappear
only
as
a
ghost
.
<EOS>
He
be
be
talk
of
as
the
depart
one
;
 
or
rather
,
such
talk
on
all
side
have
now
come
nearly
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
the
poor
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
still
think
of
him
with
regret
when
more
than
ordinarily
annoy
by
some
special
grievance
come
to
him
from
Mr.
Finespun
;
but
even
the
Duke
have
become
almost
reconcile
to
the
present
order
of
thing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
know
better
than
to
disturb
all
this
by
show
himself
again
in
public
;
and
prepare
himself
,
therefore
,
to
take
another
walk
under
the
elm
in
Kensington
Gardens
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
his
hat
on
his
head
in
the
hall
,
and
be
in
the
act
of
put
on
his
glove
,
when
there
come
a
knock
at
the
front
door
.
<EOS>
the
hall
-
porter
be
there
,
a
stout
,
plethoric
personage
,
not
give
to
many
word
,
who
be
at
this
moment
stand
with
his
master
's
umbrella
in
his
hand
,
look
as
though
he
would
fain
be
of
some
use
to
somebody
,
if
any
such
utility
be
compatible
with
the
purpose
of
his
existence
.
<EOS>
now
have
come
this
knock
at
the
door
,
while
the
umbrella
be
still
in
his
hand
,
and
the
nature
of
his
visage
change
,
and
it
be
easy
to
see
that
he
be
oppress
by
the
temporary
multiplicity
of
his
duty
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
give
me
the
umbrella
,
John

"
say
Mr.

<EOS>
John
give
up

"
<EOS>
be
Lady
Glencora

home
?
"
ask
Burgo
,
before
he
have
see
the
husband
.
<EOS>
John
turn
a
dismayed
face
upon
his
master
,
as
though
he
know
that
the
comer
ought
not
to
be
make
a
morning
call
at
that
house
,
 
as
no
doubt
he
do
know
very
well
,
 
and
make
no
instant
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
be

say
Mr.

,
make
his
way
out
as
he
have
originally
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
the
servant
will
find
out
for
you
.
"
<EOS>
then
he
go
on
his
way
across
Park
Lane
and
into
the
Park
,
never
once
turn
back
his
face
to
see
whether
Burgo
have
effect
an
entrance
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
nor
do
he
return
a
minute
earlier
than
he
would
otherwise
have
do
.
<EOS>
after
all
,
there
be
something
chivalrous
about
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
Lady
Glencora
be
at
home
,
"
say
the
porter
,
not
stir
to
make
any
further
inquiry
.
<EOS>
It
be
no
business
of
his
if
Mr.
Palliser
choose
to
receive
such
a
guest

<EOS>
He
have
not

<EOS>
Burgo

"
  
<EOS>
Alice
be
dumbfound
,
and
know
not
how
to
speak
either
to
him
or
to
her
;
but
she
stand
with
her
eye
rivet
on
the
face
of
the
man
of
whom
she
have
hear
so
much
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
She

<EOS>
She
find
it
quite
impossible
to
speak
a
word
to
him
then
 
at
the
spur
of
the
moment
,
but
she
acknowledge
the
introduction
with
a

<EOS>
Poor
Burgo
also
find
it
difficult
enough
to
speak
.
<EOS>
what
could

say
?
<EOS>
His
cause
be
one
which
certainly
do
not
admit
of
be
plead
in
the
presence
of
a
strange
lady
;
and
he
may
have
know
from
the
moment
in
which
he
hear
Glencora
's
request
that
a
third
person
should
be
summon
to
their
meeting
 
and
probably
do
know
,
that
there
be
no
longer
any
hope
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
on
the
card
that
he
should
win
.
<EOS>
but
there
remain
one
thing
that
he
must
do
.
<EOS>
He
must
get
himself
out
of

how
be
he
to

that
?

in

Burgo
know
that
he
must
go
,
 
<EOS>
feel
that
he
must
skulk
away
as
best
he
may
,
and
perhaps
hear
a
low
titter
of
half
-
suppress
laughter
as
he
go
.
<EOS>
even
that
may
be
possible
.

He

turn
to

bow
again
very
slightly
to

He
be

He

from

he
not

over

press
her

stoop
over

then
he

out

down

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
do
at
once
as
his
wife
have
say
,
and
come
up
-
stair
to
the
little
front
room
,
as
soon
as
he
have
deposit
his
hat
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Alice
be
,
in
fact
,
in
doubt
what
she
should
do
,
as
to
mention
,
or
omit
to
mention
,
Mr.
Fitzgerald
's
name
.
<EOS>
in
an
ordinary
way
,
it
would
be
natural
that
she
should
name
any
visitor
who
have
call
,
and
she
specially
dislike
the
idea
of
remain
silent
because
that
visitor
have
come
as
the
lover
of
her
host
's
wife
.
<EOS>
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
she
owe
much
to
Lady
Glencora
;
and
there
be
no
imperative
reason
,
as
thing
have
go
,
why
she
should
make
mischief
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
further
danger
to
be
apprehend
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Palliser
at
once
put
an
end
to
her
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
have
a
visitor
here
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
him
as
I
go
out
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
meet
him
at
the
hall
door
.
<EOS>
He
,
of
course
,
be
wrong
to
come
here
;
 
so
wrong
,
that
he
deserve
punishment
,
if
there
be
any
punishment
for
such
offence
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
have
be
punish
,
I
think
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
as
for
Glencora
,
"
continue
Mr.
Palliser
,
without
any
apparent
notice
of
what
Alice
have
say
,
"
I
think
it
better
that
she
should
see
him
or
not
,
as
she
should
herself
decide
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
no
choice
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
as
it
turn
out
,
he
be
show
up
here
at
once
.
<EOS>
She
send
for
me
,
and
I
think
she
be
right
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Glencora
be
alone
when
he
come
in
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
for
a
minute
or
two
,
 
till
I
could
get
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
question
to
ask
about
it
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
,
after
wait
for
a
few
moment
.
<EOS>
He
have
probably
think
that
Alice
would
say
something
further
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
that
you
be
within
reach
of
her
,
as
otherwise
her
position
may
have
be
painful
.
<EOS>
for
her
,
and
for
me
perhaps
,
it
may
be
as
well
that
he
have
be
here
.
<EOS>
as
for
him
,
I
can
only
say
,
that
I
be
force
to
suppose
him
to
be
a
villain
.
<EOS>
what
a
man
do
when
drive
by
passion
,
I
can
forgive
;
but
that
he
should
deliberately
plan
scheme
to
ruin
both
her
and
me
,
be
what
I
can
hardly
understand
.
"
<EOS>
as
he
make
this
little
speech
I
wonder
whether
his
conscience
say
anything
to
him
about
Lady
Dumbello
,
and
a
certain
evening
in
his
own
life
,
on
which
he
have
venture
to
call
that
lady
,
Griselda
.
  
<EOS>
the
little
party
of
three
dine
together
very
quietly
,
and
after
dinner
they
all
go
to
work
with
their
novel
.
<EOS>
before
long
Alice
see
that
Mr.
Palliser
be
yawn
,
and
she
begin
to
understand
how
much
he
have
give
up
in
order
that
his
wife
may
be
secure
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
,
when
he
have
leave
the
room
for
a
few
minute
,
in
order
that
he
may
wake
himself
by
walk
about
the
house
,
that
Glencora
tell
Alice
of
his
yawning
down
at
Matching
.
<EOS>
"
I
use
to
think
that
he
would
fall
in
piece
.
<EOS>
what
be
we
to
do
about
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
seem
to
notice
it
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
very
well
,
"
say
the
other
;
"
but
he
will
set
us
off
yawn
as
bad
as
himself
,
and
then
he
will
notice
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
give
himself
up
to
politic
,
till
nothing
else
have
any
salt
in
it
leave
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
why
such
a
man
as
that
want
a
wife
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
very
hard
upon
him
,
Cora
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
be
his
wife
,
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
but
,
of
course
,
I
know
why
he
get
married
.
<EOS>
and
I
ought
to
feel
for
him
as
he
have
be
so
grievously
disappointed
.
"
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Palliser
have
walk
off
his
sleep
,
return
to
the
room
,
and
the
remainder
of
the
evening
be
pass
in
absolute
tranquillity
.
  
<EOS>
Burgo
Fitzgerald
,
when
he
leave
the
house
,
turn
back
into
Grosvenor
Square
,
not
know
,
at
first
,
whither
he
be
go
.
<EOS>
He
take
himself
as
far
as
his
uncle
's
door
,
and
then
,
have
pause
there
for
a
moment
,
hurry
on
.
<EOS>
for
half
an
hour
,
or
thereabout
,
something
like
true
feeling
be
at
work
within
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
have
once
more
pressed
to
his
bosom
the
woman
he
have
,
at
any
rate
,
think
that
he
have
love
.
<EOS>
He
have
have
his
arm
round
her
,
and
have
kiss
her
,
and
the
tone
with
which
she
have
call
him
by
his
name
be
still
ring
in
his
ear
,
"
Burgo
!
"
<EOS>
He
repeat
his
own
name
audibly
to
himself
,
as
though
in
this
way
he
could
recall
her
voice
.
<EOS>
He
comfort
himself
for
a
minute
with
the
conviction
that
she
love
him
.
<EOS>
He
feel
,
 
for
a
moment
,
 
that
he
could
live
on
such
consolation
as
that
!
<EOS>
but
among
mortal
there
could
,
in
truth
,
hardly
be
one
with
whom
such
consolation
would
go
a
short
way
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
who
require
to
have
such
comfort
back
by
patés
and
curaçoa
to
a
very
large
extent
,
and
now
it
may
be
doubt
whether
the
amount
of
patés
and
curaçoa
at
his
command
would
last
him
much
longer
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
not
go
in
and
tell
his
aunt
at
once
of
his
failure
,
as
he
could
gain
nothing
by
do
so
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
think
that
he
would
not
tell
his
aunt
at
all
.
<EOS>
so
he
turn
back
from
Grosvenor
Square
,
and
go
down
to
his
club
in
St.
James
's
Street
,
feel
that
billiard
and
brandy
-
and
-
water
might
,
for
the
present
,
be
the
good
restorative
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
he
go
back
,
he
blame
himself
very
greatly
in
the
matter
of
those
bank
-
note
which
he
have
allow
Lady
Monk
to
take
from
him
.
<EOS>
how
have
it
come
to
pass
that
he
have
be
such
a
dupe
in
her
hand
?
<EOS>
when
he
enter
his
club
in
St.
James
's
Street
his
mind
have
leave
Lady
Glencora
,
and
be
hard
at
work
consider
how
he
may
best
contrive
to
get
that
spoil
out
of
his
aunt
's
possession
.
   
<EOS>
from
London
to
Baden
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
following
morning
everybody
be
stir
by
time
at
Mr.
Palliser
's
house
in
Park
Lane
,
and
the
master
of
that
house
yawn
no
more
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
life
in
start
for
a
long
journey
,
and
the
life
be
the
strong
and
the
full
if
the
thing
and
people
to
be
carry
be
numerous
and
troublesome
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
be
a
little
troublesome
,
and
would
not
come
down
to
breakfast
in
time
.
<EOS>
when
rebuke
on
account
of
this
manifest
breach
of
engagement
,
she
assert
that
the
next
train
would
do
just
as
well
;
and
when
Mr.
Palliser
prove
to
her
,
with
much
trouble
,
that
the
next
train
could
not
enable
them
to
reach
Paris
on
that
day
,
she
declare
that
it
would
be
much
more
comfortable
to
take
a
week
in
go
than
to
hurry
over
the
ground
in
one
day
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
she
want
so
much
as
to
see
Folkestone
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
that
be
the
case
,
why
do
not
you
tell
me
so
before
?
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
,
in
his
gravest
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Richard
and
the
carriage
go
down
yesterday
,
and
be
already
on
board
the
packet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
if
Richard
and
the
carriage
be
already
on
board
the
packet
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
"
of
course
we
must
follow
them
,
and
we
must
put
off
the
glory
of
Folkestone
till
we
come
back
.
<EOS>
alice
,
have
not
you
observe
that
,
in
travel
,
you
be
always
drive
on
by
some
Richard
or
some
carriage
,
till
you
feel
that
you
be
a
slave
?
"
  
<EOS>
all
this
be
try
to
Mr.
Palliser
;
but
I
think
that
he
enjoy
it
,
nevertheless
,
and
that
he
be
happy
when
he
find
that
he
do
get
his
freight
off
from
the
Pimlico
Station
in
the
proper
train
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
Lady
Glencora
and
Alice
be
very
ill
cross
the
Channel
;
of
course
the
two
maid
be
bad
than
their
mistress
;
of
course
the
man
keep
out
of
their
master
's
way
when
they
be
want
,
and
drink
brandy
-
and
-
water
with
the
steward
down
-
stair
;
and
of
course
Lady
Glencora
declare
that
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
be
carry
beyond
Boulogne
that
day
;

<EOS>
have
Mr.
Palliser
become
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
as
he
have
once
hope
,
he
could
hardly
have
work
harder
than
he
do
work
.
<EOS>
It
be
he
who
find
out
which
carriage
have
be
take
for
them
,
and
who
put
,
with
his
own
hand
,
the
lady
"
dressing

case
and
cloak
on
to
the
seat
,
 
who
lay
out
the
novel
,
which
,
of
course
,
be
not
read
by
the
road
,
 
and
make
preparation
as
though
this
stage
of
their
journey
be
to
take
them
a
week
,
instead
of
five
hour
and
a
half
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
dear
!
<EOS>
how
I
have
sleep
!
"
say
Lady
Glencora

as
they

Paris

<EOS>
"
I
think
you
have
be
tolerably
comfortable
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
,
joyfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
since
we
get
out
of
that
horrid
boat
I
have
do
pretty
well
.
<EOS>
why
do
they
make
the
boat
so
nasty
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
they
do
it
on
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
difficult
to
make
them
nice
,
I
suppose
?
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
sea
that
make
them
uncomfortable

Mr.

<EOS>
"
never
mind
;
we
shall
not
have
any
more
of
it
for
twelve
month
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
We
can
get
to
the
Kurds
,
Alice
,
without
get
into
a
packet
again
.
<EOS>
that
,
to
my
way
of
thinking
,
be
the
great
comfort
of
the
Continent
.
<EOS>
one
can
go
everywhere
without
be
seasick

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
say
nothing

but
he
sigh
as
he
think
of
be
absent
for
a
whole
year
.
<EOS>
He
have
say
that
such
be
his
intention
,
and
would
not
at
once
go
back
from
what
he
himself
have
say
.
<EOS>
but
how
be
he
to
live
for
twelve
month
out
of
the
House
of
Commons
?
<EOS>
what
be
he
to
do
with
himself
,
with
his
intellect
and
his
energy
,
during
all
these
come
dreary
day
?
<EOS>
and
then
,
 
he
may
have
be
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
!
<EOS>
He
may
even
now
,
at
this
very
moment
,
have
be
upon
his
leg
,
make
a
financial
statement
of
six
hour
"
duration
,
to
the
delight
of
one
-
half
of
the
House
,
and
bewilderment
of
the
other
,
instead
of
drag
cloak
across
that
dingy
,
dull
,
dirty
waiting
-
room
at
the
Paris
Station
,
in
which
british
subject
be
keep
in
prison
while
their
box
be
be
tumble
out
of
the
carriage

<EOS>
"
but
we
be
not
to
stop
here
;
 
be
we
?
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
mournfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
dear
;
 
I
have
give
the
key
to
Richard
.
<EOS>
We
will
go
on
at
once

"
  
<EOS>
"
but
can
not
we
have
our
thing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
about
half
an
hour
,
"
plead
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
we
must
bear
it
,
Alice
?
"
say
Lady
Glencora
as
she
get
into
the
carriage
that
be
wait
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
think
of
the
last
time
in
which
she
have
be
in
that
room
,
 
when
George
and
Kate
have
be
with
her
,
 
and
the
two
girl
have
be
quite
content
to
wait
patiently
while
their
trunk
be
be
examine
.
<EOS>
but
Alice
be
now
travel
with
great
people
,
 
with
people
who
never
speak
of
their
wealth
,
or
seem
ever
to
think
of
it
,
but
who
show
their
consciousness
of
it
at
every
turn
of
their
life
.
<EOS>
"
after
all
,
"
Alice
have
say
to
herself
more
than
once
,
"
I
doubt
whether
the
burden
be
not
great
than
the
pleasure
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
stay
in
Paris
for
a
week
,
and
during
that
time
Alice
find
that
she
become
very
intimate
with
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
at
Matching
she
have
,
in
truth
,
see
but
little
of
him
,
and
have
know
nothing
.
<EOS>
now
she
begin
to
understand
his
character
,
and
learn
how
to
talk
to
him
,
She
allow
him
to
tell
her
of
thing
in
which
Lady
Glencora
resolutely
persist
in

no
interest

<EOS>
She
delight
him
by
write
down
in
a
little
pocket
-
book
the
number
of
egg
that
be
consume
in
Paris
every
day
,
whereas
Glencora
protest
that
the
information
be
worth
nothing
unless
her
husband
could
tell
her
how
many
of
the
egg
be
good
,
and
how
many
bad
.
<EOS>
and
Alice
be
glad
to
find
that
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
female
operative
be
employ
in
Paris
,
while
Lady
Glencora
say
it
be
a
great
shame
,
and
that
they
ought
all
to
have
husband
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Palliser
explain
that
that
be
impossible
,
because
of
the
redundancy
of
the
female
population
,
she
anger
him
very
much
by
assert
that
she
see
a
great
many
man
walk
about
who

she
be
quite
sure
,

<EOS>
"
I
do
so
wish
you
have
marry
him
!
"
<EOS>
Glencora
say
to
Alice
that
evening
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
always
have
have
a
pocket
-
book
ready
to
write
down
the
figure

and
you
would
have
pretend
to
care
about
the
egg
,
and
the
bottle
of
wine
,
and
the
rest
of
it
.
<EOS>
as
for
me

I
can
not
do
it

<EOS>
if
I
see
an
hungry
woman

I
can
give
her
my
money

if
she

I
can
nurse
her

I
hear
of

I
can
hate
him

I

better
make
up
our

a
month

You

look
at

there

I

Lady

"
I

one
of
the

have
in
the

go
on
with
the
card
,

have
call
the

four
more
piece
of
gold
up
to
that
which
Lady

have

down

cunningly
catch

,
and
,
with
all
the
courtesy
of
which
he
be
master
,
have
push
them
further
on
towards
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
suppose
herself
to
be
unknown
there
in
the
salon
,
but
no
doubt
all
the
croupier
and
half
the
company
know
well
enough
who
be
the
new
customer
at
the
table
.
<EOS>
there
be
still
the
space
open
,
near
to
which
she
stand
,
and
then
someone
motion
to
her
to
come
and
take
up
the
money
which
she
have
win
.
<EOS>
She
hesitate
,
and
then
the
croupier
ask
her
,
in
that
low
,
indifferent
voice
which
these
man
always
use
,
whether
she
desire
that
her
money
should
remain

<EOS>
She
nod
her
head
to
him

at
once
draw
the

back
again
to
the
spot

She
catch
hold

again

<EOS>
but
there
be
that
in
her
eye
which
tell
Alice
that
she
be
really
frightened
.
<EOS>
some
one
then
place
a
chair
for
her
at
the
table
,
and
in
her
confusion
,
not
know
what
she
be
to
do
,
she
seat
herself
.
<EOS>
"
come
away

"
say
Alice
,
take
hold

disregard
everything

her

in
the

whisper
her
word

and
then
I
will
come
away

"
<EOS>
the
croupier
again
ask
her
if

be

she
again
nod
her
head
.
<EOS>
everybody
at

table
be
now
look
at
her

<EOS>
the
woman
especially
be
stare
at
her
,
 
those
horrid
woman
with
vermilion
cheek
,
and
loud
bonnet
half
off
their
head
,
and
hard
,
shameless
eye
,
and
white
glove
,
which
,
when
take
off
in
the
ardour
of
the
game
,
disclose
dirty
hand
.
<EOS>
They
stare
at
her
with
that
fix
stare
which
such
woman
have
,
and
Alice
see
it
all
,
and
tremble
.

again
she

"

leave
it

"
I
can
not

"
say
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
do
,
there
will
be
a
fuss
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
the
next
time
.
<EOS>
"
what
she
say
be
,
of
course
,
in
English
,
and
be
probably
understand
by
no
one
near
her
;
but
it
be
easy
to
be
see
that
she
be
trouble
,
and
,
of
course
,
those
around
her
look
at
her
the
more
because
of
her
trouble
.
<EOS>
again
that
little
question
and
answer
go
on
between
her
and
the
croupier
,
and
on
this
occasion
the
money
be
pile
up
on
the
compartment
 
a
heap
of
gold
which
make
envious
the
heart
of
many
who
stand
around
there
.
<EOS>
Alice
have
now
both
her
hand
on
the
back
of
the
chair
,
need
support
.
<EOS>
if
the
devil
should
persist
,
and
increase
that
stock
of
gold
again
,
she
must
go
and
seek
for
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
She
know
not
what
else
to
do
.
<EOS>
She
understand
nothing
of
the
table
,
or
of
its
law
;
but
she
suppose
all
those
minister
of
the
game
to
be
thief
,
and
believe
that
all
villainous
contrivance
be
within
their
capacity
.
<EOS>
She
think
that
they
may
go
on
add
to
that
heap
so
long
as
Lady
Glencora
would
sit
there
,
presume
that
they
may
thus
get
her
into
their
clutch
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
she
do
not
sift
her
suspicion
.
<EOS>
who
do
at
such
moment
?
<EOS>
"
come
away
at
once
,
and
leave
it
,
"
she
say
,
"
or
I
shall
go
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
that
moment
the
croupier
rake
it
all
up
,
and
carry
it
all
away
;
but
Alice
do
not
see
that
this
have
be
do
.
<EOS>
a
hand
have
be
place
on
her
shoulder
,
and
as
she
turn
round
her
face
her
eye
meet
those
of
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
go
,
"
say
Glencora
,
laugh
.
<EOS>
and
now
she
,
turn
round
,
also
see
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
glad
that
you
be
come
,
"
say
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
bring
her
here
?
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
there
be
anger
in
his
tone
,
and
anger
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
He
take
his
wife
's
arm
upon
his
own
,
and
walk
away
quickly
,
while
Alice
follow
them
alone
.
<EOS>
He
go
off
at
once
,
down
the
front
step
of
the
building
,
towards
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
what
he
say
to
his
wife
,
Alice
do
not
hear
;
but
her
heart
be
swell
with
the
ill
-
usage
to
which
she
herself
be
subject
.
<EOS>
though
she
may
have
to
go
back
alone
to
England
,
she
would
tell
him
that
he
be
ill
-
treat
her
.
<EOS>
She
follow
him
on
,
up
into
their
drawing
-
room
,
and
there
he
stand
with
the
door
open
in
his
hand
for
her
,
while
Lady
Glencora
throw
herself
upon
a
sofa
,
and
burst
out
into
affected
laughter
.
<EOS>
"
here
be
a
piece
of
work
,
"
she
say
,
"
about
a
little
accident
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
an
accident

say
Mr.

<EOS>
"
yes

<EOS>
You
do
not
suppose
that
I
sit
down
there
mean
to
win
all
that
money
?
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
he
look
at
her
with
scorn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Palliser

say
Alice
,
"

this
evening

a
manner

It
be
clear

I
will
return

say
Glencora
,
jump
up
,

that

<EOS>
"
You

It

I
certainly

she
answer

"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
do

Mr.
Palliser

say
Alice
,
"
I
will
go
to
bed

<EOS>
You
can
think
over
all
this
at
night
,
 
and
so
can
I.
<EOS>
good
night
,
Glencora

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
Alice
take
her
candle
,
and
march
off
to
her
own
room
,
with
all
the
dignity
of
which
she
be
mistress
.
   
<EOS>
from
Baden
to
Lucerne
.
 
<EOS>
the
second
week
in
July
see
Mr.
Palliser
's
party
,
carriage
and
all
,
establish
at
Lucerne
,
in
Switzerland
,
safe
beyond
the
reach
of
the
german
gambling
table
.
<EOS>
Alice
Vavasor
be
still
with
them
;
and
the
reader
will
therefore
understand
that
that
quarrel
about
Lady
Glencora
's
wickedness
have
be
settle
without
any
rupture
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
settle
amicably
,
and
by
the
time
that
they
have
reach
Lucerne
,
Alice
be
incline
to
acknowledge
that
the
whole
thing
be
not
worth
notice
;
but
for
many
day
her
anger
against
Mr.
Palliser
have
not
be
remove
,
and
her
intimacy
with
him
have
be
much
check
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
a
month
since
the
occurrence
of
that
little
scene
in
the
salon
at
Baden
,
which
be
describe
in
the
last
chapter
,
 
since
Mr.
Palliser
have
march
off
with
his
wife
,
leave
Alice
to
follow
as
she
good
could
by
herself
.
<EOS>
after
that
,
as
the
reader
may
remember
,
he
have
almost
tell
her
that
she
be
to
be
blame
because
of
his
wife
's
indiscretion
;
and
when
she
have
declare
her
intention
of
leave
him
,
and
make
her
way
home
to
England
by
herself
,
he
have
answer
her
not
at
all
,
and
have
allow
her
to
go
off
to
her
own
room
under
the
full
ban
of
his
displeasure
.
<EOS>
since
that
he
have
make
no
apology
to
her
;
he
have
not
,
in
so
many
word
,
acknowledge
that
he
have
wrong
her
;
but
Alice
have
become
aware
that
he
intend
to
apologize
by
his
conduct
,
and
she
have
be
content
so
far
to
indulge
his
obstinacy
as
to
accept
this
conduct
on
his
part
in
lieu
of
any
outspoken
petition
for
pardon
.
<EOS>
the
acknowledgement
of
a
mistake
and
the
asking
for
grace
be
almost
too
much
for
any
woman
to
expect
from
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
early
on
the
morning
after
the
scene
in
question
,
Lady
Glencora
have
go
into
Alice
's
bedroom
,
and
have
find
her
cousin
in
her
dressing
-
gown
,
pack
up
her
thing
,
or
look
as
though
she
intend
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
such
a
fool
,
"
she
say
,
"
as
to
think
anything
of
what
occur
yesterday
?
<EOS>
"
Alice
assure
her
that
,
whether
fool
or
not
,
she
do
think
a
great
deal
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
in
point
of
fact
,
"
say
Alice
,
"
I
can
not
stand
it
.
<EOS>
He
expect
me
to
take
care
of
you
,
and
choose
to
show
himself
offend
if
you
do
not
do
just
what
he
think
proper
;
whereas
,
as
you
know
well
enough
,
I
have
not
the
slight
influence
over
you
.
<EOS>
"
all
these
position
Lady
Glencora
contradict
vigorously
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
Mr.
Palliser
have
be
wrong
in
walk
out
of
the
Assembly
Rooms
as
he
have
do
,
leave
Alice
behind
him
.
<EOS>
so
much
Lady
Glencora
admit
.
<EOS>
but
this
have
come
of
his
intense
anxiety
.
"
<EOS>
and
you
know
what
a
man
he
be
,
"
say
his
wife
 
<EOS>
"
how
stiff
,
and
hard
,
and
unpleasant
he
can
be
without
mean
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
reason
why
I
should
bear
his
unpleasantness
,
"
say
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
there
be
,
 
great
reason
.
<EOS>
You
be
to
do
it
for
the
sake
of
friendship
.
<EOS>
and
as
for
my
not
do
what
you
tell
me
,
you
know
that
be
not
true
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
I
not
beg
you
to
keep
away
from
the
table
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
you
do
,
and
of
course
I
be
naughty
;
but
that
be
only
once
.
<EOS>
alice
,
I
want
you
more
than
I
ever
want
you
before
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
you
more
now
,
but
you
must
stay
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
consent
to
come
down
to
breakfast
without
any
immediate
continuance
of
her
active
preparation
for
go
,
and
at
last
,
of
course
,
she
stay
.
<EOS>
when
she
enter
the
breakfast
-
room
Mr.
Palliser
come
up
to
her
,
and
offer
her
his
hand
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
alternative
but
to
take
it
,
and
then
seat
herself
.
<EOS>
that
there
be
an
intended
apology
in
the
manner
in
which
he
offer
her
toast
and
butter
,
she
be
convince
;
and
the
special
courtesy
with
which
he
hand
her
to
the
carriage
,
when
she
and
Lady
Glencora
go
out
for
their
drive
,
after
dinner
,
be
almost
as
good
as
a
petition
for
pardon
.
<EOS>
so
the
thing
go
on
,
and
by
degree
Mr.
Palliser
and
Miss
Vavasor
be
again
friend
.
  
<EOS>
but
Alice
never
know
in
what
way
the
matter
be
settle
between
Mr.
Palliser
and
his
wife
,
or
whether
there
be
any
such
settling
.
<EOS>
probably
there
be
none
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
course
,
he
understand
that
it
do
not
mean
anything
,
"
Lady
Glencora
have
say
.
<EOS>
"
He
know
that
I
do
not
want
to
gamble
.
"
<EOS>
but
let
that
be
as
it
may
,
their
sojourn
at
Baden
be
curtail
,
and
none
of
the
party
go
up
again
to
the
Assembly
Rooms
before
their
departure
.
  
<EOS>
before
establish
themselves
at
Lucerne
they
make
a
little
tour
round
by
the
Falls
of
the
Rhine
and
Zurich
.
<EOS>
in
their
preparation
for
this
journey
,
Alice
make
a
struggle
,
but
a
struggle
in
vain
,
to
avoid
a
passage
through
Basle
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
too
clear
to
her
that
Mr.
Palliser
be
determined
to
go
by
Basle
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
say
that
she
have
recollection
connect
with
that
place
which
would
make
a
return
to
it
unpleasant
to
her
.
<EOS>
if
she
could
have
say
as
much
,
even
to
Glencora
,
Mr.
Palliser
would
no
doubt
have
go
round
,
 
round
by
any
more
distant
route
that
may
have
be
necessary
to
avoid
that
eternal
gateway
into
Switzerland
.
<EOS>
but
she
could
not
say
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
averse
to
talk
about
herself
and
her
own
affair
,
even
with
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
of
course
Lady
Glencora
know
the
whole
story
of
Mr.
John
Grey
and
his
rejection
,
 
and
know
much
also
of
that
other
story
of
Mr.
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
and
,
of
course
,
like
all
Alice
's
friend
,
she
hate
George
Vavasor
,
and
be
prepared
to
receive
Mr.
John
Grey
with
open
arm
,
if
there
be
any
possibility
that
her
cousin
would
open
her
arm
to
him
also
.
<EOS>
but
Alice
be
so
stubborn
about
her
own
affair
that
her
friend
find
it
almost
impossible
to
speak
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
that
you
trouble
me
,
"
Alice
once
say
,
"
but
that
you
trouble
yourself
about
that
which
be
of
no
use
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
do
and
over
;
and
though
I
know
that
I
have
behave
badly
,
 
very
badly
,
 
yet
<EOS>
I
believe
that
everything
have
be
do
for
the
good
.
<EOS>
I
be
inclined
to
think
that
I
can
live
alone
,
or
perhaps
with
my
cousin
Kate
,
more
happily
than
I
could
with
any
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
such
nonsense
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
perhaps
so
;
but
,
at
any
rate
,
I
mean
to
try
.
<EOS>
We
Vavasors
do
not
seem
to
be
good
at
marrying
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
some
one
to
break
your
heart
for
you
;
that
be
what
you
want
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
in
say
this
she
know
but
little
of
the
state
of
her
friend
's
heart
,
and
perhaps
be
hardly
capable
of
understand
it
.
<EOS>
with
all
the
fuss
that
Lady
Glencora
make
to
herself
,
 
with
all
the
tear
that
she
have
shed
about
her
lost
lover
,
and
be
so
often
shed
,
 
with
all
her
continual
thinking
of
the
matter
,
she
have
never
love
Burgo
Fitzgerald
as
Alice
Vavasor
have
love
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
but
her
nature
be
altogether
different
to
that
of
Alice
.
<EOS>
love
with
her
have
in
it
a
gleam
of
poetry
,
a
spice
of
fun
,
a
touch
of
self
-
devotion
,
something
even
of
hero
-
worship
;
but
with
it
all
there
be
a
dash
of
devilry
,
and
an
aptitude
almost
for
wickedness
.
<EOS>
She
know
Burgo
Fitzgerald
to
be
a
scapegrace
,
and
she
like
him
the
well
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
She
despise
her
husband
because
he
have
no
vice
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
give
everything
she
have
to
Burgo
,
 
pour
her
wealth
upon
him
with
a
total
disregard
of
herself
,
have
she
be
allow
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
forgive
him
sin
after
sin
,
and
may
perhaps
have
bring
him
round
,
at
last
,
to
some
life
not
absolutely
reckless
and
wretched
.
<EOS>
but
in
all
that
she
may
have
do
,
there
would
have
be
no
thoughtfulness
,
 
no
true
care
either
for
him
or
for
herself
.
<EOS>
and
now
that
she
be
married
there
be
no
thoughtfulness
,
or
care
either
for
herself
or
for
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
be
ready
to
sacrifice
herself
for
him
,
if
any
sacrifice
may
be
require
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
believe
herself
to
be
unfit
for
him
,
and
would
have
submit
to
be
divorce
,
 
or
smother
out
of
the
way
,
for
the
matter
of
that
,
 
if
the
law
of
the
land
would
have
permit
it
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
never
for
a
moment
give
to
herself
the
task
of
think
what
conduct
on
her
part
may
be
the
good
for
his
welfare
.
  
<EOS>
but
Alice
's
love
have
be
altogether
of
another
kind
,
 
and
I
be
by
no
means
sure
that
it
be
better
suit
for
the
work
of
this
work
-
a
-
day
world
than
that
of
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
thoughtful
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
there
be
no
poetry
in
it
,
but
I
will
say
that
it
lack
romance
.
<EOS>
Its
poetry
be
too
hard
for
romance
.
<EOS>
there
be
certainly
in
it
neither
fun
nor
wickedness
;
nor
be
there
,
I
fear
,
so
large
a
proportion
of
hero
-
worship
as
there
always
should
be
in
a
girl
's
heart
when
she
give
it
away
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
in
it
an
amount
of
self
-
devotion
which
none
of
those
near
to
her
have
hitherto
understand
,
 
unless
it
be
that
one
to
whom
the
understanding
of
it
be
of
the
most
importance
.
<EOS>
in
all
the
trouble
of
her
love
,
of
her
engagement
,
and
her
broken
promise
,
she
have
think
more
of
other
than
of
herself
,
 
and
,
indeed
,
those
trouble
have
chiefly
come
from
that
self
-
devotion
.
<EOS>
She
have
leave
John
Grey
because
she
fear
that
she
would
do
him
no
good
as
his
wife
,
 
that
she
would
not
make
him
happy
;
and
she
have
afterwards
betroth
herself
for
a
second
time
to
her
cousin
,
because
she
believe
that
she
could
serve
him
by
marry
him
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
have
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
very
wrong
to
give
up
the
man
she
do
love
,
and
more
wrong
again
in
suggest
to
herself
the
possibility
of
marry
the
man
she
do
not
love
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
she
have
be
wrong
in
both
,
and
be
undergo
repentance
with
very
bitter
inward
sackcloth
.
<EOS>
but
she
say
little
of
all
this
even
to
her
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
They
go
to
Lucerne
by
Basle
,
and
put
up
at
the
big
hotel
with
the
balcony
over
the
Rhine
,
which
Alice
remember
so
well
.
<EOS>
on
the
first
evening
of
her
arrival
she
find
herself
again
look
down
upon
the
river
,
as
though
it
may
have
be
from
the
same
spot
which
she
have
occupy
together
with
George
and
Kate
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
truth
,
that
house
be
very
large
,
and
have
many
bedroom
over
the
water
.
<EOS>
who
have
ever
be
through
Basle
,
and
not
stand
in
one
of
them
,
look
down
upon
the
father
of
water
?
<EOS>
here
,
on
this
very
spot
,
in
one
of
these
balcony
,
be
bring
to
her
a
letter
from
her
cousin
Kate
,
which
be
fill
with
tiding
respect
her
cousin
George
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
bring
it
to
her
with
his
own
hand
,
and
she
have
no
other
alternative
but
to
read
it
in
his
presence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
George
have
lose
his
election
,
"
the
letter
begin
.
<EOS>
for
one
moment
Alice
think
of
her
money
,
and
the
vain
struggle
in
which
it
have
be
waste
.
<EOS>
for
one
moment
,
something
like
regret
for
the
futility
of
the
effort
she
have
make
come
upon
her
.
<EOS>
but
it
pass
away
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
worth
our
while
to
try
it
,
"
she
say
to
herself
,
and
then
go
on
with
her
letter
.
<EOS>
"
I
and
Aunt
Greenow
be
up
in
London
,
"
the
letter
go
on
to
say
,
"
and
have
just
hear
the
news
.
<EOS>
though
I
have
be
here
for
three
day
,
and
have
twice
send
word
to
him
to
say
so
,
he
have
not
be
near
me
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
good
that
he
should
stay
away
,
as
I
do
not
know
how
any
word
could
pass
between
us
that
would
be
pleasant
.
<EOS>
the
poll
be
finish
this
afternoon
,
and
he
lose
his
election
by
a
large
majority
.
<EOS>
there
be
five
candidate
altogether
for
the
two
seat
 
three
Liberals
,
and
two
conservative
.
<EOS>
the
other
two
Liberals
be
seat
,
and
he
be
the
last
of
the
five
.
<EOS>
I
continue
to
hear
tiding
about
him
from
day
to
day
,
 
or
rather
,
my
aunt
hear
them
and
tell
them
to
me
,
which
fill
me
full
of
fear
as
to
his
future
career
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
he
have
abandon
his
business
,
and
that
he
have
now
no
source
of
income
.
<EOS>
I
would
willingly
share
what
I
have
with
him
;
or
I
would
do
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
after
keep
back
enough
to
repay
you
gradually
what
he
owe
you
,
I
would
give
him
all
my
share
of
the
income
out
of
the
estate
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
do
this
while
we
be
presume
to
be
enemy
.
<EOS>
I
be
up
here
to
see
a
lawyer
as
to
some
step
which
he
be
take
to
upset
grandpapa
's
will
.
<EOS>
the
lawyer
say
that
it
be
all
nonsense
,
and
that
George
's
lawyer
be
not
really
in
earnest
;
but
I
can
not
do
anything
till
the
matter
be
settle
.
<EOS>
dear
Alice
,
though
so
much
of
your
money
be
for
a
time
go
,
I
be
bind
to
congratulate
you
on
your
safety
,
 
on
what
I
may
more
truly
call
your
escape
.
<EOS>
You
will
understand
what
my
own
feeling
must
be
in
write
this
,
after
all
that
I
do
to
bring
you
and
him
together
,
 
after
all
my
hope
and
ambition
respect
him
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
money
,
it
shall
be
repay
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
shall
ever
dare
to
indulge
in
any
strong
desire
again
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
will
forgive
me
the
injury
I
have
do
you
;
 
and
I
know
that
you
will
pity
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
here
to
see
the
London
lawyer
,
 
but
not
only
for
that
.
<EOS>
Aunt
Greenow
be
buy
her
wedding
clothe
,
and
Captain
Bellfield
be
in
lodging
near
to
us
,
also
buy
his
trousseau
;
or
,
as
I
should
more
properly
say
,
have
it
buy
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
hardly
in
a
mood
for
much
mirth
,
but
it
be
impossible
not
to
laugh
inwardly
when
she
discuss
before
me
the
state
of
his
wardrobe
,
and
propose
economical
arrangement
 
greatly
to
his
disgust
.
<EOS>
at
present
,
she
hold
him
very
tightly
in
hand
,
and
make
him
account
for
all
his
hour
as
well
as
all
his
money
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of
course
,
he
will
run
wild
<EOS>
directly
he
be
married
,
"
she
say
to
me
,
yesterday
;
"
and
,
of
course
,
there
will
always
be
a
fight
about
it
;
but
the
more
I
do
to
tame
him
now
,
the
less
wild
he
will
be
by
-
and
-
by
.
<EOS>
and
though
I
dare
say
,
I
shall
scold
him
sometimes
,
I
shall
never
quarrel
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
all
that
be
true
;
but
what
a
fool
she
be
to
trouble
herself
with
such
a
man
.
<EOS>
She
say
she
do
it
for
an
occupation
.
<EOS>
I
take
courage
to
tell
her
once
that
a
cage
tiger
would
give
her
as
much
to
do
,
and
be
less
dangerous
.
<EOS>
She
be
angry
at
this
,
and
answer
me
very
sharply
.
<EOS>
I
have
try
my
hand
on
a
tiger
,
she
say
,
and
have
feel
his
claws
.
<EOS>
She
choose
to
sacrifice
herself
,
 
if
a
sacrifice
it
be
to
be
,
 
when
some
good
result
may
be
possible
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
further
to

from

them
till
your

what
I
may
do

will
depend
entirely
upon
your
doing

I
feel
myself

solitary
being

I
never
think

the
death

be
such
a
loss
to
me
as
it
have
be

except
you
,
I
have
nothing
leave

,
as
regard
you

I
have
the
unpleasant
feeling
that
I
have
for
year

endeavour
to
do
you
the
bad
possible
injury
,
and
that
you
must
regard
me
as
an
enemy

you
have
escape

not

terrible
wound

<EOS>
Alice
be
always
anger
by
any
assumption
that
her
conduct
to
Mr.
Grey
have
be
affect
by
the
advice
or
influence
of
her
cousin
Kate
.
<EOS>
but
this
very
feeling
seem
to
preserve
Kate
from
the
bad
anger
,
which
may
have
be
arouse
against
her
,
have
Alice
acknowledge
the
injury
which
her
cousin
have
in
truth
do
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
undoubtedly
true
that
have
Alice
neither
see
nor
hear
from
Kate
during
the
progress
of
John
Grey
's
courtship
,
John
Grey
would
not
have
lose
his
wife

<EOS>
but
against
this
truth
Alice
be
always
protest
within
her
own
breast
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
weak
,
foolish
,
irresolute
,
 
and
have
finally
act
with
false
judgement
.
<EOS>
so
much
she
now
admit
to
herself
.
<EOS>
but
she
would
not
admit
that
any
other
woman
have
persuade
her
to
such
weakness

"
She
mistake
me
,
"
Alice
think
,
as
she
put
up
her
letter

"
She

<EOS>
Mr.

who
have
bring
her
the
letter

be
seat
in

while
Alice
have
be
read
,
have
almost
bury
himself
in
newspaper

He

five

I
!
<EOS>
yes
<EOS>
;
I
be
return

say
Mr.
Palliser

speak
with
something
like
disdain
in
his
voice
as
to
the
possibility
of
anybody
have
stand
with
a
chance
of
success
against
him
in
his
own
family
borough
.
<EOS>
for
a
full
appreciation
of
the
advantage
of
a
private
seat
in
the
House
of
Commons
let
us
always
go
to
those
great
Whig
family
who
be
mainly
instrumental
in
carry
the
Reform
Bill
.
<EOS>
the
house
of
Omnium
have
be
very
great
on
that
occasion
.
<EOS>
It
have
give
up
much
,
and
have
retain
for
family
use
simply
the
single
seat
at
Silverbridge

<EOS>
but
that
that
seat
should
be
seriously
dispute
hardly
suggest
itself
as
possible
to
the
mind
of
any
Palliser
.
<EOS>
the
Pallisers
and
the
other
great
Whig
family
have
be
right
in
this
.
<EOS>
They
have
keep
in
their
hand
,
as
reward
for
their
own
service
to
the
country
,
no
more
than
the
country
be
manifestly
willing
to
give
them
.
"

yes

I
have

so
I

can
afford

effectually
talk
down

constrain

abandon

do
this

easy

appreciate
the
advantage

"
then
there
be
nothing
more
say
about
Mr.
Bott
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
evening
,
and
while
they
be
still
sit
among
their
letter
and
newspaper
,
there
come
a
shout
along
the
water
,
and
the
noise
of
many
voice
from
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
suddenly
,
there
shoot
down
before
them
in
the
swift
run
stream
the
head
of
many
swimmer
in
the
river
,
and
with
the
swimmer
come
boat
carry
their
clothe
.
<EOS>
They
go
by
almost
like
a
glance
of
light
upon
the
water
,
so
rapid
be
the
course
of
the
current
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
shout
of
voice
,
 
the
quick
passage
of
the
boat
,
 
the
uprising
,
some
half
a
dozen
time
,
of
the
man
's
hand
above
the
surface
;
and
then
they
be
go
down
the
river
,
out
of
sight
,
 
like
morsel
of
wood
throw
into
a
cataract
,
which
be
bear
away
instantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
how
I
wish
I
could
do
that
!
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
seem
to
be
very
dangerous
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser

<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
how
they
can
stop
themselves
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
they
want
to
stop
themselves
?
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
think
how
cool
the
water
must
be
,
and
how
beautiful
to
be
carry
along
so
quickly
,
and
to
go
on
,
and
on
,
and
on
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
could
not
try
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
as
no
encouragement
be
give
to
this
proposition
,
Lady
Glencora
do
not
repeat
it
;
but
stand
lean
on
the
rail
of
the
balcony
,
and
look
enviously
down
upon
the
water
.
<EOS>
Alice
be
,
of
course
,
think
of
that
other
evening
,
when
perhaps
the
same
swimmer
have
come
down
under
the
bridge
and
before
the
balcony
,
and
where
George
Vavasor
be
sit
in
her
presence
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
I
think
,
on
that
evening
,
that
she
make
up
her
mind
to
separate
herself
from
Mr.
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
day
after
that
,
Mr.
Palliser
and
his
party
go
on
to
Lucerne
,
make
that
journey
,
as
I
have
say
,
by
slow
stage
;
take
Schaffhausen
and
Zurich
in
their
way
.
<EOS>
at
Lucerne
,
they
establish
themselves
for
some
time
,
occupy
nearly
a
dozen
room
in
the
great
hotel
which
overlook
the
lake
.
<EOS>
here
there
come
to
them
a
visitor
,
of
whose
arrival
I
will
speak
in
the
next
chapter
.
   
<EOS>
at
Lucerne
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
inclined
to
think
that
Mr.
Palliser
do
not
much
enjoy
this
part
of
his
tour
abroad
.
<EOS>
when
he
first
reach
Lucerne
there
be
no
one
there
with
whom
he
could
associate
pleasantly
,
nor
have
he
any
occupation
capable
of
make
his
time
run
easily
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
care
for
scenery
.
<EOS>
close
at
his
elbow
be
the
fine
to
be
have
in
Europe
;
but
it
be
nothing
to
him
.
<EOS>
have
he
be
simply
journey
through
Lucerne
at
the
proper
time
of
the
year
for
such
a
journey
,
when
the
business
of
the
Session
be
over
,
and
a
little
change
of
air
need
,
he
could
have
enjoy
the
thing
in
a
moderate
way
,
look
about
him
,
pass
on
,
and
know
that
it
be
good
for
him
to
be
there
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
none
of
that
passion
for
mountain
and
lake
,
none
of
that
positive
joy
in
the
heather
,
which
would
have
compensate
many
another
man
for
the
loss
of
all
that
Mr.
Palliser
be
lose
.
<EOS>
His
mind
be
ever
at
home
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
or
in
that
august
assembly
which
man
call
the
Cabinet
,
and
of
the
meeting
of
which
he
read
from
week
to
week
the
simple
record
.
<EOS>
Therein
be
mention
the
name
of
those
hero
to
whom
Fortune
have
be
so
much
kind
than
she
have
be
to
him
;
and
he
envy
them
.
<EOS>
He
take
short
,
solitary
walk
,
about
the
town
,
over
the
bridge
,
and
along
the
river
,
make
to
himself
the
speech
which
he
would
have
make
to
full
house
,
have
not
his
wife
bring
ruin
upon
all
his
hope
.
<EOS>
and
as
he
picture
to
himself
the
glorious
success
which
probably
never
would
have
be
his
have
he
remain
in
London
,
so
do
he
prophesy
to
himself
an
absolute
and
irremediable
downfall
from
all
political
power
as
the
result
of
his
absence
,
 
have
,
in
truth
,
no
sufficient
cause
for
such
despair
.
<EOS>
as
yet
,
he
be
barely
thirty
,
and
have
he
be
able
to
judge
his
own
case
as
keenly
as
he
could
have
judge
the
case
of
another
,
he
would
have
know
that
a
short
absence
may
probably
raise
his
value
in
the
estimation
of
other
rather
than
lower
it
.
<EOS>
but
his
personal
annoyance
be
too
great
to
allow
of
his
make
such
calculation
aright
.
<EOS>
so
he
become
fretful
and
unhappy
;
and
though
he
speak
no
word
of
rebuke
to
his
wife
,
though
he
never
hint
that
she
have
rob
him
of
his
glory
,
he
make
her
conscious
by
his
manner
that
she
have
bring
him
to
this
miserable
condition
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
herself
have
a
love
for
the
mountain
and
lake
,
but
it
be
a
love
of
that
kind
which
require
to
be
stimulate
by
society
,
and
which
be
keen
among
cold
chicken
,
picnic
-
pie
,
and
the
flying
of
champagne
cork
.
<EOS>
when
they
first
enter
Switzerland
she
be
very
enthusiastic
,
and
declare
her
intention
of
climb
up
all
the
mountain
,
and
go
through
all
the
pass
.
<EOS>
She
endeavour
to
induce
her
husband
to
promise
that
she
should
be
take
up
Mont
Blanc
.
<EOS>
and
I
think
she
would
have
carry
this
on
,
and
would
have
be
take
up
Mont
Blanc
,
have
Mr.
Palliser
's
aspiration
be
congenial
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
not
congenial
,
and
Lady
Glencora
soon
lose
all
her
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
by
the
time
that
they
be
settle
at
Lucerne
she
have
vote
the
mountain
to
be
bore
,
and
have
almost
learn
to
hate
the
lake
,
which
she
declare
always
make
her
wet
through
when
she
get
into
a
small
boat
,
and
sea
-
sick
when
she
put
her
foot
in
a
large
one
.
<EOS>
at
Lucerne
they
make
no
acquaintance
,
Mr.
Palliser
be
a
man
not
apt
to
new
friendship
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
even
dine
at
the
public
table
,
though
Lady
Glencora
have
express
a
wish
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
do
not
like
it
,
and
of
course
Lady
Glencora
give
way
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
moreover
,
some
marital
passage
which
be
not
pleasant
to
a
third
person
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
scold
each
other
;
but
Lady
Glencora
would
make
little
speech
of
which
her
husband
disapprove
.
<EOS>
She
would
purposely
irritate
him
by
continue
her
tone
of
badinage
,
and
then
Mr.
Palliser
would
become
fretful
,
and
would
look
as
though
the
care
of
the
world
be
too
many
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
,
therefore
,
say
that
Alice
have
much
to
make
the
first
period
of
her
sojourn
at
Lucerne
a
period
of
enjoyment
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
they
have
be
there
about
a
fortnight
,
a
stranger
arrive
,
whose
come
at
any
rate
lend
the
grace
of
some
excitement
to
their
life
.
<EOS>
Their
custom
be
to
breakfast
at
nine
,
 
or
as
near
nine
as
Lady
Glencora
could
be
induce
to
appear
,
 
and
then
Mr.
Palliser
would
read
till
three
.
<EOS>
at
that
hour
he
would
walk
forth
by
himself
,
after
have
hand
the
two
lady
into
their
carriage
,
and
they
would
be
drive
about
for
two
hour
.
<EOS>
"
how
I
do
hate
this
carriage
,
"
Lady
Glencora
say
one
day
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
so
wish
it
would
come
to
grief
,
and
be
break
to
piece
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
the
swiss
people
think
that
we
be
go
to
be
drive
about
here
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
moment
,
however
,
which
seem
to
indicate
that
Lady
Glencora
have
something
to
tell
her
cousin
,
which
,
if
tell
,
would
alter
the
monotony
of
their
life
.
<EOS>
Alice
,
however
,
would
not
press
her
for
her
secret
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
have
anything
to
tell
,
why
do
not
you
tell
it
?
"
<EOS>
Alice
once
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
so
hard
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
you
tell
me
very
often
,
"
Alice
reply
;
"
and
it
be
not
complimentary
.
<EOS>
but
hard
or
soft
,
I
will
not
make
a
petition
for
your
confidence
.
"
<EOS>
then
Lady
Glencora
say
something
savage
,
and
the
subject
be
drop
for
a
while
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
must
go
back
to
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
have
put
the
lady
into
their
carriage
,
and
be
stand
between
the
front
door
of
the
hotel
and
the
lake
on
a
certain
day
,
doubt
whether
he
would
walk
up
the
hill
to
the
left
or
turn
into
the
town
on
the
right
,
when
he
be
accost
by
an
english
gentleman
,
who
,
raise
his
hat
,
say
that
he
believe
that
he
speak
to
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
Mr.
Palliser
,
"
say
our
friend
,
very
courteously
,
return
the
salute
,
and
smile
as
he
speak
.
<EOS>
but
though
he
smile
,
and
though
he
be
courteous
,
and
though
he
raise
his
hat
,
there
be
something
in
his
look
and
voice
which
would
not
have
encourage
any
ordinary
stranger
to
persevere
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
be
not
a
man
with
whom
it
be
easy
to
open
an
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
name
be
John
Grey
,
"
say
the
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
then
the
smile
be
drop
,
the
look
of
extreme
courtesy
disappear
,
the
tone
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
voice
be
alter
,
and
he
put
out
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
know
enough
of
Mr.
John
Grey
's
history
to
be
aware
that
Mr.
John
Grey
be
a
man
with
whom
he
may
permit
himself
to
become
acquainted
.
<EOS>
after
the
interchange
of
a
very
few
word
,
the
two
man
start
off
for
a
walk
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
do
not
wish
to
meet
the
carriage
?
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
if
so
,
we
have
better
go
through
the
town
and
up
the
river
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
go
through
the
town
,
and
up
the
river
,
and
when
Mr.
Palliser
,
on
his
return
,
be
see
by
Alice
and
Lady
Glencora
,
he
be
alone
.
<EOS>
They
dine
together
,
and
nothing
be
say
.
<EOS>
together
they
saunter
out
in
the
evening
,
and
together
come
in
and
drank
their
tea
;
but
still
nothing
be
say
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
Alice
and
her
cousin
take
their
candle
from
Mr.
Palliser
's
hand
and
leave
the
sitting
-
room
for
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
as
soon
as
they
be
in
the
passage
together
,
"
I
have
be
die
for
this
time
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
speak
before
,
or
I
should
have
make
blunder
,
and
so
would
you
.
<EOS>
let
us
go
into
your
room
at
once
.
<EOS>
who
do
you
think
be
here
,
at
Lucerne
,
in
this
house
,
at
this
very
moment
?
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
know
at
once
who
it
be
.
<EOS>
She
know
,
immediately
,
that
Mr.
Grey
have
follow
her
,
though
no
word
have
be
write
to
her
or
speak
to
her
on
the
subject
since
that
day
on
which
he
himself
have
tell
her
that
they
would
meet
abroad
.
<EOS>
but
though
she
be
quite
sure
,
she
do
not
mention
his
name
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
who
be
it
,
Glencora
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
,
very
calmly
.
  
<EOS>
"
whom
in
all
the
world
would
you
best
like
to
see
?
"
say
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
cousin
Kate
,
certainly
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
it
be
not
your
cousin
Kate
.
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
believe
you
;
 
or
else
you
be
a
fool
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
be
accustomed
to
Lady
Glencora
's
mode
of
talking
,
and
therefore
do
not
think
much
of
this
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
be
a
fool
,
"
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
only
I
know
you
be
not
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
at
all
so
sure
as
to
your
be
no
hypocrite
.
<EOS>
the
person
I
mean
be
a
gentleman
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
show
a
little
excitement
,
at
any
rate
?
<EOS>
when
Plantagenet
tell
me
,
just
before
dinner
,
I
almost
jump
out
of
my
shoe
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
tell
you
himself
after
dinner
,
in
the
politest
way
in
the
world
,
no
doubt
,
and
just
as
the
servant
be
carry
away
the
apple
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
best
to
save
you
from
that
;
but
,
I
declare
,
I
believe
I
may
have
leave
him
to
do
it
;
it
would
have
have
no
effect
upon
you
.
<EOS>
who
be
it
that
have
come
,
do
you
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
know
now
,
"
say
Alice
,
very
calmly
,
"
that
Mr.
John
Grey
have
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Mr.
John
Grey
have
come
.
<EOS>
He
be
here
in
this
house
at
this
minute
;
 
or
,
more
probably
,
wait
outside
by
the
lake
till
he
shall
see
a
light
in
your
bedroom
.
"
<EOS>
then
Lady
Glencora
pause
for
a
moment
,
wait
that
Alice
may
say
something
.
<EOS>
but
Alice
say
nothing
.
"
<EOS>
well
?
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
rise
up
from
her
chair
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
?
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
nothing
to
say
?
<EOS>
be
it
the
same
to
you
as
though
Mr.
Smith
have
come
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
not
exactly
the
same
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
alive
to
the
importance
of
Mr.
Grey
's
arrival
,
and
shall
probably
lie
awake
all
night
think
about
it
,
 
if
it
will
do
you
any
good
to
know
that
;
but
I
do
not
feel
that
I
have
much
to
say
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
have
let
Mr.
Palliser
tell
you
,
in
an
ordinary
way
,
before
all
the
servant
.
<EOS>
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
not
have
make
much
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
the
least
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
you
ever
do
care
for
anybody
in
your
life
,
 
for
him
,
or
for
that
other
one
,
or
for
anybody
.
<EOS>
for
nobody
,
I
believe
;
 
except
your
cousin
Kate
.
<EOS>
still
water
,
they
say
,
run
deep
;
and
sometimes
I
think
your
water
run
too
deep
for
me
to
fathom
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
may
go
now
,
if
you
have
get
nothing
more
to
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
?
<EOS>
of
course
I
know
why
he
have
come
here
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
he
should
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
have
never
say
a
word
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
tell
me
he
should
come
,
and
I
think
it
better
not
to
say
a
word
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
may
change
his
mind
,
or
anything
may
happen
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
not
to
come
;
and
it
would
have
be
much
well
that
he
should
have
remain
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
;
 
why
;
 
why
would
it
be
well
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
his
be
here
will
do
no
good
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
good
!
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
impossible
but
that
it
should
do
all
the
good
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
look
here
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
if
you
do
not
altogether
make
it
up
with
him
before
to
-
morrow
evening
,
I
shall
believe
you
to
be
utterly
heartless
.
<EOS>
have
I
be
you
<EOS>
I
should
have
be
in
his
arm
before
this
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
now
,
and
leave
you
to
lie
awake
,
as
you
say
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
she
leave
the
room
,
but
return
in
a
moment
to
ask
another
question
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
Plantagenet
to
say
to
him
about
see
you
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
of
course
he
have
ask
permission
to
come
and
call
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
may
come
if
he
please
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
think
I
have
quarrel
with
him
,
or
would
refuse
to
see
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
may
we
ask
him
to
dine
with
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
make
up
a
picnic
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
he
be
to
be
regard
as
only
an
ordinary
person
.
<EOS>
well
;
 
good
night
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
you
,
that
be
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
doubt
whether
Alice
understand
herself
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
her
friend
be
go
,
she
put
out
her
candle
and
seat
herself
at
the
open
window
of
her
room
,
look
out
upon
the
moonlight
as
it
play
upon
the
lake
.
<EOS>
Would
he
be
there
,
think
of
her
,
look
up
,
perhaps
,
as
Glencora
have
hint
,
to
see
if
he
could
distinguish
her
light
among
the
hundred
that
would
be
flicker
across
the
long
front
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
so
,
at
any
rate
he
should
not
see
her
,
so
she
draw
the
curtain
,
and
sit
there
watch
the
lake
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
that
he
should
have
come
,
and
yet
she
love
him
dearly
for
come
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
that
he
should
have
come
,
as
his
come
could
lead
to
no
good
result
.
<EOS>
of
this
she
assure
herself
over
and
over
again
,
and
yet
she
hardly
know
why
she
be
so
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
Glencora
have
call
her
hard
;
but
her
conviction
on
that
matter
have
not
come
from
hardness
.
<EOS>
now
that
she
be
alone
,
her
heart
be
full
of
love
,
of
the
soft
romance
of
love
towards
this
man
;
and
yet
she
feel
that
she
ought
not
to
marry
him
,
even
though
he
may
still
be
willing
to
take
her
.
<EOS>
that
he
be
still
willing
to
take
her
,
that
he
desire
to
have
her
for
his
wife
in
spite
of
all
the
injury
she
have
do
him
,
there
could
be
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
why
else
have
he
follow
her
to
Switzerland
?
<EOS>
and
she
remember
,
now
at
this
moment
,
how
he
have
tell
her
at
Cheltenham
that
he
would
never
consider
her
to
be
lose
to
him
,
unless
she
should
,
in
truth
,
become
the
wife
of
another
man
.
<EOS>
why
,
then
,
should
it
not
be
as
he
wish
it
?
  
<EOS>
She
ask
herself
the
question
,
and
do
not
answer
it
;
but
still
she
feel
that
it
may
not
be
so
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
right
to
such
happiness
after
the
evil
that
she
have
do
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
drive
by
a
frenzy
to
do
that
which
she
herself
could
not
pardon
;
and
have
do
it
,
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
accept
the
position
which
should
have
be
the
reward
of
good
conduct
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
analyse
the
cause
which
make
her
feel
that
she
must
still
refuse
the
love
that
be
proffer
to
her
;
she
could
not
clearly
read
her
own
thought
;
but
the
cause
be
as
I
have
say
,
and
such
be
the
true
reading
of
her
thought
.
<EOS>
have
she
simply
refuse
his
hand
after
she
have
once
accept
it
,
 
have
she
refuse
it
,
and
then
again
change
her
mind
,
she
could
have
bring
herself
to
ask
him
to
forgive
her
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
do
so
much
more
than
this
,
and
so
much
bad
!
<EOS>
She
have
affiance
herself
to
another
man
since
she
have
belong
to
him
,
 
since
she
have
be
his
,
as
his
future
wife
.
<EOS>
what
must
he
not
think
of
her
,
and
what
not
suspect
?
<EOS>
then
she
remember
those
interview
which
she
have
have
with
her
cousin
since
she
have
write
to
him
,
accept
his
offer
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
be
with
her
in
Queen
Anne
Street
she
have
shrink
from
all
outward
sign
of
a
love
which
she
do
not
feel
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
no
caress
between
them
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
allow
him
to
touch
her
with
his
lip
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
impossible
that
the
nature
of
that
mad
engagement
between
her
and
her
cousin
George
should
ever
be
make
known
to
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
She
sit
there
wipe
the
tear
from
her
eye
as
she
look
for
his
figure
among
the
figure
by
the
lake
-
side
;
but
,
as
she
sit
there
,
she
promise
herself
no
happiness
from
his
coming
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
reader
,
can
you
forgive
her
in
that
she
have
sin
against
the
softness
of
her
feminine
nature
?
<EOS>
I
think
that
she
may
be
forgive
,
in
that
she
have
never
bring
herself
to
think
lightly
of
her
own
fault
.
  
<EOS>
if
he
be
there
,
by
the
lake
-
side
,
she
do
not
see
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
may
say
that
John
Grey
be
not
a
man
to
console
himself
in
his
love
by
look
up
at
his
lady
's
candle
.
<EOS>
He
be
one
who
be
capable
of
do
as
much
as
most
man
in
the
pursuit
of
his
love
,
 
as
he
prove
to
be
the
case
when
he
follow
Alice
to
Cheltenham
,
and
again
to
London
,
and
now
again
to
Lucerne
;
but
I
doubt
whether
a
glimmer
from
her
bedroom
-
window
,
have
it
be
unmistakably
her
own
glimmer
,
and
not
that
of
some
ugly
old
french
woman
who
may
chance
to
sleep
next
to
her
,
would
have
do
him
much
good
.
<EOS>
He
have
come
to
Lucerne
with
a
purpose
,
which
purpose
,
if
it
may
be
possible
,
he
mean
to
carry
out
;
but
I
think
he
be
already
in
bed
,
be
tired
with
long
travel
,
before
Lady
Glencora
have
leave
Alice
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
nothing
be
say
for
a
while
about
the
new
arrival
.
<EOS>
at
last
Mr.
Palliser
venture
to
speak
.
"
<EOS>
Glencora
have
tell
you
,
I
think
,
that
Mr.
Grey
be
here
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
be
an
old
friend
of
yours
,
I
believe
?
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
,
keep
her
countenance
as
well
as
she
be
able
,
say
Mr.
Grey
have
be
,
and
,
indeed
,
be
,
a
very
dear
friend
of
hers
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
know
the
whole
story
,
and
what
be
the
use
of
any
little
attempt
at
dissimulation
?
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
him
,
 
if
you
will
allow
me
?
<EOS>
"
she
go
on
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
Glencora
suggest
that
we
should
ask
him
to
dinner
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
;
and
then
that
matter
be
settle
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Grey
do
not
wait
till
dinner
-
time
to
see
Alice
.
<EOS>
early
in
the
morning
his
card
be
bring
up
,
and
Lady
Glencora
,
as
soon
as
she
see
the
name
,
immediately
run
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
you
need
not
go
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
shall
go
,
"
say
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
be
proper
on
these
occasion
,
if
you
do
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
she
go
,
whisk
herself
along
the
passage
with
a
little
run
;
and
Mr.
Grey
,
as
he
be
show
into
her
ladyship
's
usual
sitting
-
room
,
see
the
skirt
of
her
ladyship
's
dress
as
she
whisk
herself
off
towards
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
I
should
come
,
"
he
say
,
with
his
ordinary
sweet
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
that
I
should
follow
you
,
and
here
I
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
take
her
hand
,
and
hold
it
,
press
it
warmly
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
know
with
what
word
first
to
address
him
,
or
how
to
get
her
hand
back
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
to
see
you
,
 
as
an
old
friend
,
"
she
say
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
hope
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
;
 
you
hope
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
have
have
some
well
cause
for
travel
than
a
desire
to
see
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
dear
;
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
no
well
cause
,
and
,
indeed
,
none
other
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
on
purpose
to
see
you
;
and
have
Mr.
Palliser
take
you
off
to
Asia
or
Africa
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
should
have
feel
myself
compel
to
follow
him
.
<EOS>
You
know
why
I
follow
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
hardly
,
"
say
she
,
 
not
find
at
the
moment
any
other
word
that
she
could
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
because
I
love
you
.
<EOS>
You
see
what
a
plain
-
spoken
John
Bull
I
be
,
and
how
I
come
to
the
point
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
be
my
wife
;
and
they
say
that
perseverance
be
the
good
way
when
a
man
have
such
a
want
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ought
not
to
want
it
,
"
she
say
,
whisper
the
word
as
though
she
be
unable
to
speak
them
out
loud
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
and
why
should
I
not
want
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
fit
to
be
your
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
the
good
judge
of
that
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
You
have
to
make
up
your
mind
whether
I
be
fit
to
be
your
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
be
disgrace
if
you
be
to
take
me
,
after
all
that
have
pass
;
 
after
what
I
have
do
.
<EOS>
what
would
other
man
say
of
you
when
they
know
the
story
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
other
man
,
I
hope
,
would
be
just
enough
to
say
,
that
when
I
have
make
up
my
mind
,
I
be
tolerably
constant
in
keep
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
they
could
say
much
bad
of
me
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
would
say
that
you
have
be
jilt
,
and
have
forgive
the
jilt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
far
as
the
forgiveness
go
,
they
would
tell
the
truth
.
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
Alice
,
I
do
not
very
much
care
what
man
do
say
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
care
,
Mr.
Grey
;
 
and
though
you
may
forgive
me
,
I
can
not
forgive
myself
.
<EOS>
indeed
I
know
now
,
as
I
have
know
all
along
,
that
I
be
not
fit
to
be
your
wife
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
good
enough
.
<EOS>
and
I
have
do
that
which
make
me
feel
that
I
have
no
right
to
marry
anyone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
these
word
she
say
,
jerk
out
the
different
sentence
almost
in
convulsion
;
and
when
she
have
come
to
the
end
of
them
,
the
tear
be
stream
down
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
think
about
it
,
and
I
will
not

<EOS>
I
will
not
.
<EOS>
after
what
have
pass
,
I
know
that
it
will
be
well
,
 
more
seemly
,
that
I
should
remain
as
I
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
soon
after
that
she
leave
him
,
not
,
however
,
till
she
have
tell
him
that
she
would
meet
him
again
at
dinner
,
and
have
beg
him
to
treat
her
simply
as
a
friend
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
spite
of
everything
,
I
hope
that
we
may
always
be
friend
,
 
dear
friend
,

she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
we
may
,
"
he
answer
;
 
"
the
very
dear
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
leave
her
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
he
again
encounter
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
have
think
over
the
matter
since
his
interview
with
Alice
,
he
resolve
to
tell
his
whole
story
to
his
new
acquaintance
,
 
not
in
order
that
he
may
ask
for
counsel
from
him
,
for
in
this
matter
he
want
no
man
's
advice
,
 
but
that
he
may
get
some
assistance
.
<EOS>
so
the
two
man
walk
off
together
,
up
the
bank
of
the
clear
-
flow
Reuss
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
feel
the
comfort
of
have
a
companion
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
like
her
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
,
"
though
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
have
twice
be
very
angry
with
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
be
angry
with
her
,
"
say
the
lover
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
my
anger
be
in
both
instance
unjust
.
<EOS>
You
may
imagine
how
great
be
my
confidence
in
her
,
when
I
have
think
she
be
the
good
companion
my
wife
could
have
for
a
long
journey
,
take
under
circumstance
that
be
 
that
be
 
;
but
I
need
not
trouble
you
with
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
great
have
be
the
desolation
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
life
since
his
banishment
from
London
that
he
almost
feel
tempt
to
tell
the
story
of
his
trouble
to
this
absolute
stranger
.
<EOS>
but
he
bethink
himself
of
the
blood
of
the
Pallisers
,
and
refrain
.
<EOS>
there
be
comfort
which
royalty
may
never
enjoy
,
and
luxury
in
which
such
man
as
Plantagenet
Palliser
may
not
permit
themselves
to
indulge
.
  
<EOS>
"
about
her
and
her
character
I
have
no
doubt
in
the
world
,
"
say
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
in
all
that
she
have
do
I
think
that
I
have
see
her
motive
;
and
though
I
have
not
approve
of
them
,
I
have
always
know
them
to
be
pure
and
unselfish
.
<EOS>
She
have
do
nothing
that
I
do
not
forgive
as
soon
as
it
be
do
.
<EOS>
have
she
marry
that
man
,
I
should
have
forgive
her
even
that
,
 
though
I
should
have
know
that
all
her
future
life
be
destroy
,
and
much
of
mine
also
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
make
her
happy
if
she
will
marry
me
,
but
she
must
first
be
teach
to
forgive
herself
.
<EOS>
live
as
she
be
with
you
,
and
with
your
wife
,
she
may
,
perhaps
,
just
now
be
more
under
your
influence
and
your
wife
's
than
she
can
possibly
be
under
mine
.
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
,
Mr.
Palliser
promise
that
he
would
do
what
he
could
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
love
me
,
"
say
Mr.
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
say
that
he
be
sure
she
do
,
though
what
ground
he
have
for
such
assurance
<EOS>
I
be
quite
unable
to
surmise
.
<EOS>
He
be
probably
desirous
of
say
the
most
civil
thing
which
occur
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
little
dinner
-
party
that
evening
be
pleasant
enough
,
and
nothing
more
be
say
about
love
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
talk
nonsense
to
Mr.
Grey
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
contradict
all
the
nonsense
which
his
wife
talk
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
all
do
in
such
a
way
that
the
evening
pass
away
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
It
be
tacitly
admit
among
them
that
Mr.
Grey
be
to
be
allow
to
come
among
them
as
a
friend
,
and
Lady
Glencora
manage
to
say
one
word
to
him
aside
,
in
which
she
promise
to
give
him
her
most
cordial
cooperation
.
   
<EOS>
show
how
George
Vavasor
receive
a
visit
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
go
back
for
a
few
page
to
scene
which
happen
in
London
during
this
summer
,
so
that
the
reader
may
understand
Mr.
Grey
's
position
when
he
reach
Lucerne
.
<EOS>
He
have
undergo
another
quarrel
with
George
Vavasor
,
and
something
of
the
circumstance
of
that
quarrel
must
be
tell
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
already
say
that
George
Vavasor
lose
his
election
for
the
Chelsea
Districts
,
after
all
the
money
which
he
have
spend
,
 
money
which
he
have
be
so
ill
able
to
spend
,
and
on
which
he
have
lay
his
hand
in
a
manner
so
disreputable
!
<EOS>
He
have
receive
two
thousand
pound
from
the
bill
which
Alice
have
execute
on
his
behalf
,
 
or
rather
,
have
receive
the
full
value
of
three
out
of
the
four
bill
,
and
a
part
of
the
value
of
the
fourth
,
on
which
he
have
be
drive
to
raise
what
immediate
money
he
have
want
by
mean
of
a
Jew
bill
-
discounter
.
<EOS>
one
thousand
pound
he
have
pay
over
at
once
into
the
hand
of
Mr.
Scruby
,
his
Parliamentary
election
agent
,
towards
the
expense
of
his
election
;
and
when
the
day
of
polling
arrive
have
exactly
in
his
hand
the
sum
of
five
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
where
he
be
to
get
more
when
this
be
go
<EOS>
he
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
successful
,
 
if
the
enlighten
constituent
of
the
Chelsea
Districts
,
content
with
his
effort
on
behalf
of
the
River
Bank
,
should
again
send
him
to
Parliament
,
he
think
that
he
may
still
carry
on
the
war
.
<EOS>
a
sum
of
ready
money
he
would
have
in
hand
;
and
,
as
to
his
debt
,
he
would
be
grandly
indifferent
to
any
consideration
of
them
.
<EOS>
then
there
may
be
picking
in
the
way
of
a
Member
of
Parliament
of
his
calibre
.
<EOS>
company
,
 
mercantile
company
,
 
would
be
glad
to
have
him
as
a
director
,
pay
him
a
guinea
a
day
,
or
perhaps
more
,
for
his
hour
's
attendance
.
<EOS>
railway
in
want
of
vice
-
chairman
may
bid
for
his
service
;
and
in
the
City
he
may
turn
that
"
M.P.
"
which
belong
to
him
to
good
account
in
various
way
.
<EOS>
with
such
a
knowledge
of
the
City
world
as
he
possess
,
he
think
that
he
could
pick
up
a
living
in
London
,
if
only
he
could
retain
his
seat
in
Parliament
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
be
he
to
do
if
he
could
not
retain
it
?
<EOS>
no
sooner
have
Mr.
Scruby
get
the
thousand
pound
into
his
clutch
than
he
press
for
still
more
money
.
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
,
with
some
show
of
justice
on
his
side
,
point
out
to
this
all
-
devour
agent
that
the
sum
demand
have
already
be
pay
.
<EOS>
this
Mr.
Scruby
admit
,
declare
that
he
be
quite
prepared
to
go
on
without
any
further
immediate
remittance
,
although
by
do
so
may
subject
himself
to
considerable
risk
.
<EOS>
but
another
five
hundred
pound
,
pay
at
once
,
would
add
greatly
to
the
safety
of
the
seat
;
whereas
eight
hundred
judiciously
throw
in
at
the
present
moment
would
make
the
thing
quite
secure
.
<EOS>
but
Vavasor
swear
to
himself
that
he
would
not
part
with
another
shilling
.
<EOS>
never
have
he
feel
such
love
for
money
as
he
do
for
that
five
hundred
pound
which
he
now
hold
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
no
use
,
"
he
say
to
Mr.
Scruby
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
do
what
you
ask
,
and
would

<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
shrug
his

,
and
say
that
he
would
do

but

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
that

"
<EOS>
George
put
his
hand
upon
his
purse
,
and
acknowledge
to
himself
that
he
have
be
afraid
to
come
down
with
the
stumpy
.
  
<EOS>
for
the
last
five
day
of
the
affair
George
Vavasor
know
that
his
chance
be
go
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
's
face
,
manner
,
and
word
,
tell
the
result
of
the
election
as
plainly
as
any
subsequent
figure
could
do
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
absent
when
Vavasor
call
,
or
the
clerk
would
say
that
he
be
absent
.
<EOS>
He
would
answer
in
very
few
word
,
constantly
shrug
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
He
would
even
go
away
and
leave
the
anxious
candidate
while
he
be
in
the
middle
of
some
discussion
as
to
his
plan
.
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
see
that
Mr.
Scruby
no
longer
regard
him
as
a
successful
man
,
and
the
day
of
the
poll
show
very
plainly
how
right
Mr.
Scruby
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
George
Vavasor
be
reject
,
but
he
still
have
his
five
hundred
pound
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
be
subject
to
that
mortification
which
a
man
feel
when
he
reflect
that
some
little
additional
outlay
would
have
secure
his
object
.
<EOS>
whether
it
may
have
be
so
,
or
not
,
who
can
say
?
<EOS>
but
there
he
be
,
with
the
gateway
between
the
lamp
bar
against
him
,
ex
-
Member
of
Parliament
for
the
Chelsea
Districts
,
with
five
hundred
pound
in
his
pocket
,
and
little
or
nothing
else
that
he
could
call
his
own
.
<EOS>
what
be
he
to
do
with
himself
?
  
<EOS>
after
try
to
make
himself
hear
upon
the
husting
when
he
be
reject
,
and
pledge
himself
to
stand
again
at
the
next
election
,
he
go
home
to
his
lodging
in
Cecil
Street
,
and
endeavour
to
consider
calmly
his
position
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
He
have
lose
his
inheritance
.
<EOS>
He
have
abandon
one
profession
after
another
,
and
be
now
beyond
the
pale
of
another
chance
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
His
ambition
have
betray
him
,
and
there
be
no
longer
possible
to
him
any
hope
of
political
activity
.
<EOS>
He
have
estrange
from
himself
every
friend
that
he
have
ever
possess
.
<EOS>
He
have
drive
from
him
with
violence
the
devotion
even
of
his
sister
.
<EOS>
He
have
rob
the
girl
whom
he
intend
to
marry
of
her
money
,
and
have
so
insult
her
that
no
feeling
of
amity
between
them
be
any
longer
possible
.
<EOS>
He
have
nothing
now
but
himself
and
that
five
hundred
pound
,
which
he
still
hold
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
what
should
he
do
with
himself
and
his
money
?
<EOS>
He
think
over
it
all
with
outer
calmness
for
awhile
,
as
he
sit
there
in
his
arm
-
chair
.
  
<EOS>
from
the
moment
in
which
he
have
first
become
convinced
that
the
election
would
go
against
him
,
and
that
he
be
therefore
ruin
on
all
side
,
he
have
resolve
that
he
would
be
calm
amidst
his
ruin
.
<EOS>
sometimes
he
assume
a
little
smile
,
as
though
he
be
laugh
at
his
own
position
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
's
day
of
rejection
have
come
before
his
own
,
and
he
have
write
to
Mr.
Bott
a
drolle
note
of
consolation
and
mock
sympathy
.
<EOS>
He
have
shake
hand
with
Mr.
Scruby
,
and
have
poke
his
fun
at
the
agent
,
bid
him
be
sure
to
send
in
his
little
bill
soon
.
<EOS>
to
all
who
accost
him
,
he
reply
in
a
subrisive
tone
;
and
he
banter
Calder
Jones
,
whose
seat
be
quite
sure
,
till
Calder
Jones
begin
to
have
fear
that
be
quite
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
as
he
sit
himself
down
,
intend
to
come
to
some
final
decision
as
to
what
he
would
do
,
he
maintain
the
same
calmness
.
<EOS>
He
smile
in
the
same
way
,
though
there
be
no
one
there
to
see
the
smile
.
<EOS>
He
laugh
even
audibly
once
or
twice
,
as
he
vainly
endeavour
to
persuade
himself
that
he
be
able
to
regard
the
world
and
all
that
belong
to
it
as
a
bubble
.
  
<EOS>
there
come
to
him
a
moment
in
which
he
laugh
out
very
audibly
.
"
<EOS>
ha
!
ha
!
"
<EOS>
he
shout
,
rise
up
from
his
chair
,
and
he
walk
about
the
room
,
hold
a
large
paper
-
knife
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ha
!
ha
!
<EOS>
"
then
he
throw
the
knife
away
from
him
,
and
thrust
his
hand
into
his
trouser
-
pocket
,
laugh
again
 
"
<EOS>
ha
!
ha
!
"
<EOS>
He
stand
still
in
the
centre
of
the
room
,
and
the
laughter
be
very
plainly
visible
on
his
face
,
have
there
be
anybody
there
to
see
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
suddenly
there
be
a
change
upon
his
face
,
as
he
stand
there
all
alone
,
and
his
eye
become
fierce
,
and
the
cicatrice
that
mar
his
countenance
grow
to
be
red
and
ghastly
,
and
he
grin
with
his
tooth
,
and
he
clench
his
fist
as
he
still
hold
them
within
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
curse
him
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
out
loud
.
"
<EOS>
curse
him
,
now
and
for
ever
!
"
<EOS>
He
have
break
down
in
his
calmness
,
when
he
think
of
that
old
man
who
have
oppose
him
during
his
life
,
and
have
ruin
him
at
his
death
.
"
<EOS>
May
all
the
evil
which
the
dead
can
feel
cle
to
him
for
ever
and
ever
!
"
<EOS>
His
laughter
be
all
go
,
and
his
assume
tranquillity
have
desert
him
.
<EOS>
walk
across
the
room
,
he
strike
his
foot
against
a
chair
;
upon
this
,
he
take
the
chair
in
his
hand
,
and
throw
it
across
the
room
.
<EOS>
but
he
hardly
arrest
the
torrent
of
his
malediction
as
he
do
so
.
<EOS>
what
good
be
it
that
he
should
lie
to
himself
by
that
mock
tranquillity
,
or
that
false
laughter
?
<EOS>
He
lie
to
himself
no
longer
,
but
utter
a
song
of
despair
that
be
true
enough
.
<EOS>
what
should
he
do
?
<EOS>
where
should
he
go
?
<EOS>
from
what
fountain
should
he
attempt
to
draw
such
small
draught
of
the
water
of
comfort
as
may
support
him
at
the
present
moment
?
<EOS>
unless
a
man
have
some
such
fountain
to
which
he
can
turn
,
the
burden
of
life
can
not
be
bear
.
<EOS>
for
the
moment
,
Vavasor
try
to
find
such
fountain
in
a
bottle
of
brandy
which
stand
near
him
.
<EOS>
He
half
fill
a
tumbler
,
and
then
,
dash
some
water
on
it
,
swallow
it
greedily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
by

"
he
say
,
"
I
believe
it
be
the
good
thing
a
man
can
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
where
be
he
to
go
?
<EOS>
to
whom
be
he
to
turn
himself
?
<EOS>
He
go
to
a
high
desk
which
stand
in
one
corner
of
the
room
,
and
unlock
it
,
take
out
a
revolving
pistol
,
and
for
a
while
carry
it
about
with
him
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
turn
it
up
,
and
look
at
it
,
and
try
the
lock
,
and
snap
it
without
cap
,
to
see
that
the
barrel
go
round
fairly
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
beggarly
thing
to
do
,
"
he
say
,
and
then
he
turn
the
pistol
down
again
;
"
and
if
I
do
do
it
,
I
will
use
it
first
for
another
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
then
he
pour
out
for
himself
more
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
have
drunk
it
,
he
throw
himself
upon
the
sofa
,
and
seem
to
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
sleep
,
and
by
-
and
-
by
there
come
a
slight
single
knock
at
the
door
,
which
he
instantly
answer
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
answer
it
in
the
usual
way
by
bid
the
comer
to
come
in
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
who

"
<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
then
the
comer
attempt
to
enter
,
turn
the
handle
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
but
the
door
have
be
lock
,
and
the
key
be
on
Vavasor
's
side
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
who
be
there
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
again
,
speak
out
loudly
,
but
in
an
angry
voice
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
I
,
"
say
a
woman
's
voice
.
<EOS>
"
D
 
---
ation
!
"
say
George
Vavasor
.
  
<EOS>
the
woman
hear
him
,
but
she
make
no
sign
of
have
hear
him
.
<EOS>
She
simply
remain
stand
where
she
be
till
something
further
should
be
do
within
.
<EOS>
She
know
the
man
well
,
and
know
that
she
must
bide
his
time
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
patient
,
 
and
for
the
time
be
meek
,
though
it
may
be
that
there
would
come
an
end
to
her
meekness
.
<EOS>
Vavasor
,
when
he
have
hear
her
voice
,
and
know
who
be
there
,
have
again
throw
himself
on
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
there
flash
across
his
mind
another
thought
or
two
as
to
his
future
career
,
 
another
idea
about
the
pistol
,
which
still
lie
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
why
should
he
let
the
intruder
in
,
and
undergo
the
nuisance
of
a
disagreeable
interview
,
if
the
end
of
all
thing
may
come
in
time
to
save
him
from
such
trouble
?
<EOS>
there
he
lie
for
ten
minute
think
,
and
then
the
low
single
knock
be
hear
again
.
<EOS>
He
jump
upon
his
foot
,
and
his
eye
be
full
of
fire
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
it
be
useless
to
bid
her
go
and
leave
him
.
<EOS>
She
would
sit
there
,
if
it
be
through
the
whole
night
.
<EOS>
Should
he
open
the
door
and
strangle
her
,
and
pass
out
over
her
with
the
pistol
in
his
hand
,
so
that
he
may
make
that
other
reckoning
which
he
desire
to
accomplish
,
and
then
never
come
back
any
more
?
  
<EOS>
He
take
a
turn
through
the
room
,
and
then
walk
gently
up
to
the
door
,
and
undo
the
lock
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
open
the
door
,
nor
do
he
bid
his
visitor
enter
,
but
have
make
the
way
easy
for
her
if
she
choose
to
come
in
,
he
walk
back
to
the
sofa
and
throw
himself
on
it
again
.
<EOS>
as
he
do
so
,
he
pass
his
hand
across
the
table
so
as
to
bring
the
pistol
near
to
himself
at
the
place
where
he
would
be
lie
.
<EOS>
She
pause
a
moment
after
she
have
hear
the
sound
of
the
key
,
and
then
she
make
her
way
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
at
first
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
close
the
door
very
gently
,
and
then
,
look
around
,
come
up
to
the
foot
of
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
She
pause
a
moment
,
wait
for
him
to
address
her
;
but
as
he
say
nothing
,
but
lie
there
look
at
her
<EOS>
,
she
be
the
first
to
speak
.
"
<EOS>
George
,
"
she
say
,
"
what
be
I
to
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
a
woman
of
about
thirty
year
of
age
,
dress
poorly
,
in
old
garment
,
but
still
with
decency
,
and
with
some
attempt
at
feminine
prettiness
.
<EOS>
there
be
flower
in
the
bonnet
on
her
head
,
though
the
bonnet
have
that
unmistakable
look
of
age
which
be
quite
as
distress
to
bonnet
as
it
be
to
woman
,
and
the
flower
themselves
be
batter
and
fade
.
<EOS>
She
have
long
black
ringlet
on
each
cheek
,
hang
down
much
below
her
face
,
and
bring
forward
so
as
to
hide
in
some
degree
the
hollowness
of
her
jaw
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
have
a
peculiar
brightness
,
but
now
they
leave
on
those
who
look
at
her
cursorily
no
special
impression
as
to
their
colour
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
blue
,
 
that
dark
violet
blue
,
which
be
so
rare
,
but
be
sometimes
so
lovely
.
<EOS>
Her
forehead
be
narrow
,
her
mouth
be
small
,
and
her
lip
be
thin
;
but
her
nose
be
perfect
in
its
shape
,
and
,
by
the
delicacy
of
its
modelling
,
have
give
a
peculiar
grace
to
her
face
in
the
day
when
thing
have
go
well
with
her
,
when
her
cheek
have
be
full
with
youth
and
good
living
,
and
have
be
dimple
by
the
softness
of
love
and
mirth
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
dimple
there
now
,
and
all
the
softness
which
still
remain
be
that
softness
which
sorrow
and
continual
melancholy
give
to
suffer
woman
.
<EOS>
on
her
shoulder
she
wear
a
light
shawl
,
which
be

to
her
bosom
with
a
large
clasp
brooch
.
<EOS>
Her
fade
dress
be
support
by
a
wide
crinoline
,
but
the
under
garment
have
lose
all
the
grace
of
its
ancient
shape
,
and
now
tell
that
woman
's
tale
of
poverty
and
taste
for
dress
which
be
to
be
read
in
the
outward
garb
of
so
many
of
Eve
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
the
whole
story
be
tell
so
that
those
who
run
may
read
it
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
leave
her
home
this
afternoon
,
she
have
struggle
hard
to
dress
herself
so
that
something
of
the
charm
of
apparel
may
be
leave
to
her
;
but
she
have
know
of
her
own
failure
at
every
twist
that
she
have
give
to
her
gown
,
and
at
every
jerk
with
which
she
have
settle
her
shawl
.
<EOS>
She
have
despair
at
every
push
she
have
give
to
her
old
flower
,
vainly
strive
to
bring
them
back
to
their
old
form
;
but
still
she
have
persevere
.
<EOS>
with
long
tedious
care
she
have

the
old
glove
which
would
hardly
hold
her
finger

<EOS>
She
have
carefully

the
rag
of
her
sleeve
.
<EOS>
She
have

her
little
shrivel
collar
,

have
smooth
it
out
painfully
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
a
separate
grief
to
her
that
she
could
find
no
cuff
to
put
round
her
wrist
;
 
and
yet
she
know
that
no
cuff
could
have
avail
her
anything
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
avail
her
now
.
<EOS>
She
expect
nothing
from
her
visit
;
yet
she
have
come
forth
anxiously
,
and
would
have
wait
there
throughout
the
whole
night
have
access
to
his
room
be
debar
to
her

lie
there
with
his
face
turn
towards
her
,
the
window
be
at
her
back

he
could
see
her
very
plainly
.
<EOS>
He
see
and
appreciate
the
little
struggle
she
have
make
to
create
by
her
appearance
some
reminiscence
of
her
former
self
.
<EOS>
He
see
the
shine
coarseness
of
the
long
ringlet
which
have
once
be
soft
than
silk
.

He
see
the
sixpenny
brooch
on
her
bosom
where
he
have
once
place
a
jewel
,
the
price
of
which
would
now
have
be
important
to
him

it
all

there
for

read
it

little

finery

stand
look
at

with
his

thrust
deep
into

look
at

think
what
he
have
better
do
to
rid
himself
of
her
presence

if

even
quite
resolve
to
take
that
little
final
journey

which
we
have
speak

with
the
pistol
in
his
hand

why
should
he
not

leave
her
there

,
for

he
not

her
his

what

care

little
for

care
more

angry

then
his
mind
be

make
up
as
to
that
final
journey

therefore
he
desire
to
rid
himself

nuisance

as
badly
off

you

in

bad

probably

may
allow
myself
a
week

so
that
your
staying

do
no

then
she
rise

go

let

His
bantering
tone
,
in
speak
of
his
own
position
,
have
be
successful
.
<EOS>
It
have
cause
her
to
take
herself
off
quietly

She
know
enough
of
his
usual
manner
to
be
aware
that
his
threat
of
self
destruction
be
probably
unreal
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
what
he
have
say
have
create
some
feeling
in
her
heart

have
induce
her
to
yield
to
him

go
away

peace

pay
a
visit

nearly
seven
o'clock

evening

a
hot
,
July
evening

when
the
woman
go
from
Vavasor
's
room

leave
him
there
alone

<EOS>
It
be
necessary
that
he
should
immediately
do
something
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
he
must
dine
,
unless
he
mean
to
carry
out
his
threat
,
and
shoot
himself
at
once
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
no
such
intention
as
that
,
although
he
stand
for
some
minute
with
the
pistol
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
be
think
then
of
shoot
some
one
else
.

but
he
resolve
that
,
if
he
do
so
at
all
,
he
would
not
do
it
on
that
evening
,

he
lock
up
the
pistol
again
in
the
stand
desk

after
that
,
he
take
up
some
paper

They
contain
the

another
on
another
day
would
take
out
a
load
of

"
that
be

and
he
condemn

<EOS>
then

and
pack
up
two
portmanteaus
,
fold

"

very
day

<EOS>
"
It
may
be
possible
that
he
would
change
his
mind
;
but
as
he
would
desire
to
start
without
delay
,
if
he
do
go
,
he
would
pay

what
he

<EOS>
It
be
manifest
enough
that
he

<EOS>
then
he
laugh
in

,
shake

and
turn

quickly
on

,
walk
up

declare
in

hearing
,
 
as
I
be
in
the
habit
of
do
occasionally
behind
your

that
you
be
a
blackguard

to
spit
in

and
defy
you

I

<EOS>
"
nothing

Mr.

will
have
any

that
you
can

of
course

annoy
me

<EOS>

<EOS>

and
I
mean
to
annoy
you

too

before
I
have
do

Will
you
fight
me
?

fight
a
duel
with
you

with
pistol

certainly
not

I

look
here
,
Mr.

You
manage

worm
yourself
into
an
intimacy
with
my
cousin

Miss
Vavasor
,
and
to
become
engaged
to
her
.
<EOS>
when
she
find
out
what

how
paltry

vile

she
change

I

I
find
that
,
in
spite
of
all
that
she
have
say
to
you

which
be
enough
,
I
should
have
think

to
keep
any
man
of
spirit
out

you
still
persecute
her
by
go
to

force
yourself
upon
her
presence

<EOS>
now
,
I
give
you
two
alternative

<EOS>
You
shall
either
give

stop

have
courage
enough

fight
me

I
will
meet
you
in
any
country

<EOS>
I
will
fight
you
here
in
London

,
if
you
be
afraid

I
will
go
over

better

I
do
not

then
you
be
a

perhaps
I

your

give

the
option

behave
like
a
gentleman

you
have
refuse
it

<EOS>
now
,
look
here
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
here
with
arm
,
and
I
do
not
intend
to
leave
this
room
without
use
them
,
unless
you
will
promise
to
give
me
the
meeting
that
I
have
propose

"
<EOS>
and
he
take
the
pistol
out
of
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
that
you
be
go
to
murder
me
?
"
<EOS>
Grey
ask
.
<EOS>
there
be
two
window
in
the
room
,
and
he
have
be
sit
near
to
that
which
be
furthest
remove
from
the
fireplace
,
and
consequently
furthest
remove
from
the
bell
,
and
his
visitor
be
now
stand
immediately
between
him
and
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
have
to
think
what
step
he
may
best
take
,
and
to
act
upon
his
decision
instantly
.
<EOS>
He
be
by
no
mean
a
timid
man
,
and
be
one
,
moreover
,
very
little
prone
to
believe
in
extravagant
action
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
think
,
even
now
,
that
this
disappointed
,
ruin
man
have
come
there
with
any
intention
of
kill
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
know
that
a
pistol
in
the
hand
of
an
angry
man
be
dangerous
,
and
that
it
behove
him
to
do
his
good
to
rid
himself
of
the
nuisance
which
now
encumber
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
mean
that
you
be
go
to
murder
me
?
<EOS>
"
he
have
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
you
shall
not
leave
this
room
alive
unless
you
promise
to
meet
me
,
and
fight
it
out
.
"
<EOS>
upon
hear
this
,
Grey
turn
himself
towards
the
bell
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
move
a
step
,
I
will
fire
at
you
,
"
say
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
Grey
pause
a
moment
,
and
look
him
full
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
say
Vavasor
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
would
be
murder
,
"
say
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
think
that
you
will
frighten
me
by
ugly
word
,
"
say
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
beyond
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
Grey
have
stop
for
a
moment
to
fix
his
eye
on
the
other
man
's
face
;
but
it
be
only
for
a
moment
,
and
then
he
go
on
to
the
bell
.
<EOS>
He
have
see
that
the
pistol
be
point
at
himself
,
and
have
once
think
of
rush
across
the
room
at
his
adversary
,
calculate
that
a
shot
fire
at
him
as
he
do
so
may
miss
him
,
and
that
he
would
then
have
a
fair
chance
of
disarm
the
madman
.
<EOS>
but
his
chief
object
be
to
avoid
any
personal
conflict
,
to
escape
the
indignity
of
a
scramble
for
the
pistol
,
 
and
especially
to
escape
the
necessity
of
a
consequent
appearance
at
some
police
-
office
,
where
he
would
have
to
justify
himself
,
and
answer
the
question
of
a
lawyer
hire
to
cross
-
question
him
.
<EOS>
He
make
,
therefore
,
towards
the
bell
,
trust
that
Vavasor
would
not
fire
at
him
,
but
have
some
little
thought
also
as
to
the
danger
of
the
moment
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
everything
be
over
for
him
now
,
 
that
the
fatal
hour
have
come
,
and
that
eternity
be
close
upon
him
.
<EOS>
something
of
the
spirit
of
a
prayer
flash
across
his
mind
as
he
move
.
<EOS>
then
he
hear
the
click
of
the
pistol
's
hammer
as
it
fall
,
and
be
aware
that
his
eye
be
dazzle
,
though
he
be
unconscious
of
see
any
flame
.
<EOS>
He
feel
something
in
the
air
,
and
know
that
the
pistol
have
be
fire
;
 
but
he
do
not
know
whether
the
shot
have
strike
him
or
have
miss
him
.
<EOS>
His
hand
be
out
for
the
bell
-
handle
,
and
he
have
pull
it
,
before
he
be
sure
that
he
be
unhurt
.
  
<EOS>
"
D
 
---
ation
!
"
exclaim
the
murderer
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
pull
the
trigger
again
.
<EOS>
though
the
weapon
have
of
late
be
so
often
in
his
hand
,
he
forget
,
in
the
agitation
of
the
moment
,
that
his
missing
once
be
but
of
small
matter
if
he
choose
to
go
on
with
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
be
there
not
five
other
barrel
for
him
,
each
make
itself
ready
by
the
discharge
of
the
other
?
<EOS>
but
he
have
pause
,
forget
,
in
his
excitement
,
the
use
of
his
weapon
,
and
before
he
have
bethink
himself
that
the
man
be
still
in
his
power
,
he
hear
the
sound
of
the
bell
.
<EOS>
"
D
 
---
ation
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
.
<EOS>
then
he
turn
round
,
leave
the
room
,
hurry
down
the
stair
,
and
make
his
way
out
into
the
street
,
have
again
pass
the
girl
on
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
Grey
,
when
he
perceive
that
his
enemy
be
go
,
turn
round
to
look
for
the
bullet
or
its
mark
.
<EOS>
He
soon
find
the
little
hole
in
the
window
-
shutter
,
and
probe
it
with
the
point
of
his
pencil
,
come
upon
the
morsel
of
lead
which
may
now
just
as
readily
have
be
within
his
own
brain
.
<EOS>
there
he
leave
it
for
the
time
,
and
then
make
some
not
inaccurate
calculation
as
to
the
narrowness
of
his
own
escape
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
stand
directly
between
Vavasor
and
the
shutter
,
and
he
find
,
from
the
height
of
the
hole
,
that
the
shot
must
have
pass
close
beneath
his
ear
.
<EOS>
He
remember
to
have
hear
the
click
of
the
hammer
,
but
he
could
not
remember
the
sound
of
the
report
,
and
when
the
girl
enter
the
room
,
he
perceive
at
once
from
her
manner
that
she
be
unaware
that
firearm
have
be
use
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
that
gentleman
leave
the
house
?
"
<EOS>
Grey
ask
.
<EOS>
the
girl
say
that
he
have
leave
the
house
.
"
<EOS>
do
not
admit
him
again
,
"
say
he
;
 
"
that
be
,
if
you
can
avoid
it
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
be
not
in
his
right
sense
.
<EOS>
"
then
he
ask
for
Mr.
Jones
,
his
landlord
,
and
in
a
few
minute
the
pugilistic
tailor
be
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
during
those
few
minute
he
have
be
call
upon
to
resolve
what
he
would
do
now
.
<EOS>
Would
he
put
the
police
at
once
upon
the
track
of
the
murderer
,
who
be
,
as
he
remember
too
well
,
the
first
cousin
of
the
woman
whom
he
still
desire
to
make
his
wife
?
<EOS>
that
cross
-
examination
which
he
would
have
to
undergo
at
the
police
-
office
,
and
again
probably
in
an
assize
court
,
in
which
all
his
relation
with
the
Vavasor
family
would
be
make
public
,
be
very
vivid
to
his
imagination
.
<EOS>
that
he
be
call
upon
by
duty
to
do
something
he
feel
almost
assure
.
<EOS>
the
man
who
have
be
allow
to
make
such
an
attempt
once
with
impunity
,
may
probably
make
it
again
.
<EOS>
but
he
resolve
that
he
need
not
now
say
anything
about
the
pistol
to
the
pugilistic
tailor
,
unless
the
tailor
say
something
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Jones
,
"
he
say
,
"
that
man
whom
I
have
to
put
out
of
the
room
once
before
,
have
be
here
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
have
there
be
another
tussle
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
nothing
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
but
we
must
take
some
step
to
prevent
his
get
in
again
,
if
we
can
help
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jones
promise
his
aid
,
and
offer
to
go
at
once
to
the
police
.
<EOS>
to
this
,
however
,
Mr.
Grey
demur
,
say
that
he
should
himself
seek
assistance
from
some
magistrate
.
<EOS>
Jones
promise
to
be
very
vigilant
as
to
watch
the
door
;
and
then
John
Grey
sit
down
to
his
breakfast
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
think
much
of
what
have
occur
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
that
he
should
not
think
much
of
so
narrow
an
escape
.
<EOS>
He
have
probably
be
as
near
death
as
a
man
may
well
be
without
receive
any
injury
;
and
the
more
he
think
of
it
,
the
more
strongly
he
be
convince
that
he
could
not
allow
the
thing
to
pass
by
without
some
notice
,
or
some
precaution
as
to
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
at
eleven
o'clock
he
go
to
Scotland
Yard
,
and
see
some
officer
great
in
power
over
policeman
,
and
tell
him
all
the
circumstance
,
 
confidentially
.
<EOS>
the
powerful
officer
recommend
an
equally
confidential
reference
to
a
magistrate
;
and
towards
evening
a
very
confidential
policeman
in
plain
clothe
pay
a
visit
to
Vavasor
's
lodging
in
Cecil
Street
.
<EOS>
but
Vavasor
lodge
there
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bunsby
,
who
be
also
very
confidential
,
 
and
at
her
wit
'
end
because
she
could
not
learn
the
special
business
of
the
stranger
who
call
<EOS>
,
 
state
that
Mr.
George
Vavasor
leave
her
house
in
a
cab
at
ten
o'clock
that
morning
,
have
take
with
him
such
luggage
as
he
have
pack
,
and
have
go
,
"
she
be
afraid
,
for
good
,
"
as
Mrs.
Bunsby
express
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
go
for
good
,
and
at
the
moment
in
which
the
policeman
be
make
the
inquiry
in
Cecil
Street
,
be
lean
over
the
side
of
an
american
steamer
which
have
just
get
up
her
steam
and
weigh
her
anchor
in
the
Mersey
.
<EOS>
He
be
on
board
at
six
o'clock
,
and
it
be
not
till
the
next
day
that
the
cabman
be
trace
who
have
carry
him
to
Euston
Square
Station
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
it
be
soon
know
that
he
have
go
to
America
,
but
it
be
not
think
worth
while
to
take
any
further
step
towards
arrest
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
himself
be
decidedly
oppose
to
any
such
attempt
,
declare
his
opinion
that
his
own
evidence
would
be
insufficient
to
obtain
a
conviction
.
<EOS>
the
big
man
in
Scotland
Yard
be
loth
to
let
the
matter
drop
.
<EOS>
Their
mouth
water
after
the
job
,
and
they
have
very
numerous
and
very
confidential
interview
with
John
Grey
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
decide
that
nothing
should
be
do
.
"
<EOS>
pity
!
"
say
one
enterprise
superintendent
,
in
answer
to
the
condoling
of
a
brother
superintendent
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
pity
be
no
name
for
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
great
shame
as
ever
<EOS>
I
know
since
I
join
the
force
.
<EOS>
a
man
as
be
a
Member
of
Parliament
only
last
Session
,
 
as
belong
to
no
end
of
swell
club
,
a
gent
as
well
know
in
London
as
any
gent
about
the
town
!
<EOS>
and
I
would
have
have
him
back
in
three
month
,
as
sure
as
my
name
's
Walker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
that
superintendent
feel
that
his
profession
and
his
country
be
alike
disgrace
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
George
Vavasor
vanish
from
our
page
,
and
will
be
hear
of
no
more
.
<EOS>
Roebury
know
him
no
longer
,
nor
Pall
Mall
,
nor
the
Chelsea
Districts
.
<EOS>
His
disappearance
be
a
nine
day
"
wonder
,
but
the
world
at
large
know
nothing
of
the
circumstance
of
that
attempt
in
Suffolk
Street
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
himself
tell
the
story
to
no
one
,
till
he
tell
it
to
Mr.
Palliser
at
Lucerne
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scruby
complain
bitterly
of
the
way
in
which
Vavasor
have
rob
him
;
but
I
doubt
whether
scruby
,
in
truth
,
lose
much
by
the
transaction
.
<EOS>
to
Kate
,
down
in
Westmoreland
,
no
tiding
come
of
her
brother
,
and
her
sojourn
in
London
with
her
aunt
have
nearly
come
to
an
end
before
she
know
that
he
be
go
.
<EOS>
even
then
the
rumour
reach
her
through
Captain
Bellfield
,
and
she
learn
what
few
fact
she
know
from
Mrs.
Bunsby
in
Cecil
Street
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
always
mysterious
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
and
now
he
have
vanish
.
<EOS>
I
hate
mystery
,
and
,
as
for
myself
,
I
think
it
will
be
much
well
that
he
should
not
come
back
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
perhaps
Kate
be
of
the
same
opinion
,
but
,
if
so
,
she
keep
it
to
herself
.
   
<EOS>
in
which
come
tiding
of
great
moment
to
all
Pallisers
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
they
have
be
for
a
day
or
two
together
at
Lucerne
that
Mr.
Grey
tell
Mr.
Palliser
the
story
of
George
Vavasor
's
visit
to
him
in
Suffolk
Street
.
<EOS>
have
begin
the
history
of
his
connection
with
Alice
,
he
find
himself
oblige
to
go
with
it
to
the
end
,
and
as
he
describe
the
way
in
which
the
man
have
vanish
from
the
sight
of
all
who
have
know
him
,
 
that
he
have
in
truth
go
,
so
as
no
longer
to
be
a
cause
of
dread
,
he
could
not
without
dissimulation
,
keep
back
the
story
of
that
last
scene
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
try
to
murder
you
!
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
should
be
catch
and
,
 
and
 
"
Mr.
Palliser
hesitate
,
not
like
to
say
boldly
that
the
first
cousin
of
the
lady
who
be
now
live
with
him
ought
to
be
hang
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
well
as
it
be
,
"
say
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
actually
walk
into
your
room
in
the
day
time
,
and
fire
a
pistol
at
you
as
you
be
sit
at
your
breakfast
!
<EOS>
He
do
that
in
London
,
and
then
walk
off
and
go
abroad
,
as
though
he
have
nothing
to
fear
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
just
it
,
"
say
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
begin
to
think
that
something
ought
to
be
do
to
make
life
more
secure
in
the
metropolis
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
have
he
not
know
Mr.
Grey
,
or
be
accustomed
to
see
the
other
man
in
Parliament
,
he
would
not
have
think
so
much
about
it
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
almost
too
much
for
him
when
he
reflect
that
one
man
whom
he
now
call
his
friend
,
have
be
nearly
murder
in
daylight
,
in
the
heart
of
his
own
part
of
London
,
by
another
man
whom
he
have
reckon
among
his
Parliamentary
supporter
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
have
get
your
money
too
!
"
<EOS>
say
Palliser
,
put
all
the
circumstance
of
the
case
together
.
<EOS>
in
answer
to
this
Mr.
Grey
say
that
he
hope
the
loss
may
eventually
be
his
own
;
but
that
he
be
bind
to
regard
the
money
which
have
be
take
as
part
of
Miss
Vavasor
's
fortune
.
"
<EOS>
He
be
simply
the
great
miscreant
of
whom
I
ever
hear
in
my
life
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
wonder
be
that
Miss
Vavasor
should
ever
have
bring
herself
to
 
to
like
him
.
"
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Grey
apologize
for
Alice
,
explain
that
her
love
for
her
cousin
have
come
from
her
early
year
;
that
the
man
himself
be
clever
and
capable
of
assume
pleasant
way
,
and
that
he
have
not
be
wholly
bad
till
ruin
have
come
upon
him
.
"
<EOS>
He
attempt
public
life
and
make
himself
miserable
by
fail
,
as
most
man
do
who
make
that
attempt
,
"
say
Grey
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
statement
which
Mr.
Palliser
could
not
allow
to
pass
without
notice
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
two
man
get
away
from
George
Vavasor
and
their
own
individual
interest
,
and
go
on
seriously
discuss
the
merit
and
demerit
of
public
life
.
<EOS>
"
the
end
of
it
all
be
,
"
say
Grey
at
last
,
"
that
public
man
in
England
should
be
rich
like
you
,
and
not
poor
like
that
miserable
wretch
,
who
have
now
lose
everything
that
the
Fates
have
give
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
continue
to
live
at
Lucerne
in
this
way
for
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
,
though
he
be
not
unfrequently
alone
with
Alice
,
do
not
plead
his
suit
in
direct
word
;
but
continue
to
live
with
her
on
term
of
close
and
easy
friendship
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
her
that
her
cousin
have
leave
England
,
 
that
he
have
go
to
America
immediately
after
his
disappointment
in
regard
to
the
seat
in
Parliament
,
and
that
he
would
probably
not
return
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
George
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alice
have
say
;
"
he
be
a
man
very
much
to
be
pity
.
"
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
man
very
much
to
be
pity
,
"
Grey
have
reply
.
<EOS>
after
that
,
nothing
more
be
say
between
them
about
George
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
from
Lady
Glencora
Alice
do
hear
something
;
but
Lady
Glencora
herself
have
not
hear
the
whole
story
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
he
misbehave
himself
,
my
dear
,
"
Lady
Glencora
say
;
"
but
then
,
you
know
,
he
always
do
that
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
he
see
Mr.
Grey
and
insult
him
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
have
well
not
ask
anything
about
it
till
by
-
and
-
by
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
able
to
get
anything
out
of
him
then
.
<EOS>
"
in
answer
to
this
Alice
make
her
usual
protest
,
and
Lady
Glencora
,
as
be
customary
,
tell
her
that
she
be
a
fool
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
inclined
to
think
that
Mr.
Grey
know
what
he
be
about
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
once
scold
him
very
vehemently
for
not
bring
the
affair
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
go
on
to
Italy
before
it
be
settle
,
"
she
say
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
suppose
you
can
go
with
us
,
unless
it
be
settle
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
protest
that
he
have
no
intention
of
go
to
Italy
in
either
case
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
it
will
be
put
off
for
another
year
or
two
,
and
you
be
both
of
you
as
old
as
Adam
and
Eve
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
ancient
people
be
never
impatient
,
"
say
Grey
,
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
be
you
I
would
go
to
her
and
tell
her
,
roundly
,
that
she
should
marry
me
,
and
then
I
would
shake
her
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
to
scold
her
,
till
she
do
not
know
whether
she
stand
on
her
head
or
her
heel
,
she
would
come
to
reason
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
suppose
you
try
that
,
Lady
Glencora
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
.
<EOS>
It
be
she
that
always
scold
me
,
 
as
you
will
her
,
when
she
be
your
wife
.
<EOS>
You
and
Mr.
Palliser
be
very
much
alike
.
<EOS>
You
be
both
of
you
so
very
virtuous
that
no
woman
would
have
a
chance
of
pick
a
hole
in
your
coat
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
Lady
Glencora
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
Alice
would
,
no
doubt
,
have
submit
herself
patiently
to
her
lover
's
rebuke
,
and
would
have
confess
her
own
sin
towards
him
with
any
amount
of
self
-
accusation
that
he
may
have
require
;
but
she
would
not
,
on
that
account
,
have
be
more
willing
to
obey
him
in
that
one
point
,
as
to
which
he
now
require
present
obedience
.
<EOS>
He
understand
that
she
must
be
teach
to
forgive
herself
for
the
evil
she
have
do
,
 
to
forgive
herself
,
at
any
rate
in
part
,
 
before
she
could
be
induce
to
return
to
her
old
allegiance
to
him
.
<EOS>
thus
they
go
on
together
at
Lucerne
,
pass
quiet
,
idle
day
,
 
with
some
pretence
of
reading
,
with
a
considerable
amount
of
letter
-
writing
,
with
boat
excursion
and
pony
excursion
,
 
till
the
pony
excursion
come
to
a
sudden
end
by
mean
of
a
violent
edict
,
as
to
which
,
and
the
cause
of
it
,
a
word
or
two
must
be
say
just
now
.
<EOS>
during
these
day
of
the
boat
and
the
pony
,
the
carriage
which
Lady
Glencora
hate
so
vehemently
be
shut
up
in
limbo
,
and
thing
go
very
pleasantly
with
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
receive
political
letter
from
England
,
which
make
his
mouth
water
sadly
,
and
be
often
very
fidgety
.
<EOS>
Parliament
be
not
now
sit
,
and
the
Government
would
,
of
course
,
remain
intact
till
next
February
.
<EOS>
may
it
not
be
possible
that
when
the
rent
come
in
the
Cabinet
,
he
may
yet
be
present
at
the
darning
?
<EOS>
He
be
a
constant
man
,
and
have
once
declare
his
intention
of
be
absent
for
a
year
.
<EOS>
He
continue
to
speak
to
Grey
of
his
come
travel
,
as
though
it
be
impossible
that
they
should
be
over
until
after
the
next
Easter
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
sigh
for
Westminster
,
and
regret
the
blue
book
which
be
accumulate
themselves
at
Matching
;
 
till
on
a
sudden
,
there
come
to
him
tiding
which
upset
all
his
plan
,
which
route
the
pony
,
which
make
everything
impossible
,
which
make
the
Alps
impassable
and
the
railway
dangerous
,
which
drive
Burgo
Fitzgerald
out
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
head
,
and
so
confuse
him
that
he
could
no
longer
calculate
the
blunder
of
the
present
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
<EOS>
all
the
Palliser
world
be
about
to
be
move
from
its
low
depth
,
to
the
summit
of
its
high
mountain
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
have
whisper
into
her
husband
's
ear
that
she
think
it
probable
 
;
she
be
not
sure
;
 
she
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
and
then
she
burst
out
into
tear
on
his
bosom
as
he
sit
by
her
on
her
bedside
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
beside
himself
when
he
leave
her
,
which
he
do
with
the
primary
intention
of
telegraph
to
London
for
half
a
dozen
lead
physician
.
<EOS>
He
go
out
by
the
lake
side
,
and
walk
there
alone
for
ten
minute
in
a
state
of
almost
unconscious
exaltation
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
quite
remember
where
he
be
,
or
what
he
be
do
.
<EOS>
the
one
thing
in
the
world
which
he
have
lack
;
the
one
joy
which
he
have
want
so
much
,
and
which
be
so
common
among
man
,
be
come
to
him
also
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
it
be
to
him
as
though
each
hand
already
rest
on
the
fair
head
of
a
little
male
Palliser
,
of
whom
one
should
rule
in
the
hall
at
Gatherum
,
and
the
other
be
eloquent
among
the
Commons
of
England
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
 
for
the
last
eight
or
nine
month
,
since
his
first
hope
have
begin
to
fade
,
 
he
have
be
a
man
degrade
in
his
own
sight
amidst
all
his
honour
.
<EOS>
what
good
be
all
the
world
to
him
if
he
have
nothing
of
his
own
to
come
after
him
?
<EOS>
We
must
give
him
his
due
,
too
,
when
we
speak
of
this
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
have
wit
enough
to
hide
his
grief
from
his
wife
;
his
knowledge
of
woman
and
of
man
in
social
life
have
not
be
sufficient
to
teach
him
how
this
should
be
do
;
but
he
have
wish
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
willingly
rebuke
her
for
his
disappointment
,
either
by
a
glance
of
his
eye
,
or
a
tone
of
his
voice
;
and
now
he
have
already
forgive
everything
.
<EOS>
Burgo
Fitzgerald
be
a
myth
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Marsham
should
never
again
come
near
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bott
be
,
of
course
,
a
thing
abolish
;
 
he
have
not
even
have
the
sense
to
keep
his
seat
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
Dandy
and
Flirt
should
feed
on
gilded
corn
,
and
there
should
be
an
artificial
moon
always
ready
in
the
ruin
.
<EOS>
if
only
those
d
 
---
<EOS>
able
saddle
-
pony
of
Lucerne
have
not
come
across
his
wife
's
path
!
<EOS>
He
go
at
once
into
the
yard
and
order
that
the
pony
should
be
abolish
;
 
send
away
,
one
and
all
,
to
the
furth
confine
of
the
canton
;
and
then
he
himself
inspect
the
cushion
of
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
be
they
dry
?
<EOS>
as
it
be
August
in
those
day
,
and
August
in
Lucerne
be
a
warm
month
,
it
may
be
presume
that
they
be
dry
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
remember
that
he
have
promise
to
send
Alice
up
to
his
wife
,
and
he
hurry
back
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
be
alone
in
the
breakfast
-
room
,
wait
for
him
and
for
his
wife
.
<EOS>
in
these
day
,
Mr.
Grey
would
usually
join
them
at
dinner
;
but
he
seldom
see
them
before
eleven
or
twelve
o'clock
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
then
he
would
saunter
in
and
join
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
they
would
all
be
together
till
the
evening
.
<EOS>
when
the
expectant
father
of
embryo
duke
enter
the
room
,
Alice
perceive
at
once
that
some
matter
be
astir
.
<EOS>
His
manner
be
altogether
change
,
and
he
show
by
his
eye
that
he
be
eager
and
move
beyond
his
will
not
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
he
say
,
"
would
you
mind
go
up
to
Glencora
's
room
?
<EOS>
She
wish
to
speak
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
never
call
her
Alice
before
,
and
as
soon
as
the
word
be
speak
,
he
remember
himself
and
blush
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
not
ill
,
I
hope
?
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
she
be
not
ill
.
<EOS>
at
least
I
think
she
have
well
not
get
up
quite
yet
.
<EOS>
do
not
let
her
excite
herself
,
if
you
can
help
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
to
her
at
once
,
"
say
Alice
rise
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
much
oblige
to
you
;
 
but
,
Miss
Vavasor
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
call
me
Alice
just
now
,
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
I
take
it
as
a
great
compliment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
blush
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
I
?
<EOS>
very
well
.
<EOS>
then
I
will
do
it
again
 
if
you
will
let
me
.
<EOS>
but
,
if
you
please
,
do
be
as
calm
with
her
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
easily
excited
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
if
there
be
anything
she
fancy
,
we
will
take
care
to
get
it
for
her
;
but
she
must
be
keep
quiet
.
<EOS>
"
upon
this
Alice
leave
him
,
have
have
no
moment
of
time
to
guess
what
have
happen
,
or
be
about
to
happen
;
and
he
be
again
alone
,
contemplate
the
future
glory
of
his
house
.
<EOS>
have
he
a
thought
for
his
poor
cousin
Jeffrey
,
whose
nose
be
now
so
terribly
out
of
joint
?
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
His
thought
be
all
of
himself
,
and
the
good
thing
that
be
come
to
him
,
 
of
the
new
world
of
interest
that
be
be
open
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
well
to
him
,
this
,
than
be
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
<EOS>
He
would
rather
have
it
in
store
for
him
to
be
father
of
the
next
Duke
of
Omnium
,
than
make
half
a
dozen
consecutive
annual
speech
in
Parliament
as
to
the
way
and
mean
,
and
expenditure
of
the
british
nation
!
<EOS>
Could
it
be
possible
that
this
foreign
tour
have
produce
for
him
this
good
fortune
?
<EOS>
if
so
,
how
luckily
have
thing
turn
out
!
<EOS>
He
would
remember
even
that
ball
at
Lady
Monk
's
with
gratitude
.
<EOS>
perhaps
a
residence
abroad
would
be
good
for
Lady
Glencora
at
this
particular
period
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
if
so
,
abroad
she
should
certainly
live
.
<EOS>
before
resolve
,
however
,
on
anything
permanently
on
this
head
,
he
think
that
he
may
judiciously
consult
those
six
first
-
rate
London
physician
,
whom
,
in
the
first
moment
of
his
excitement
,
he
have
be
desirous
of
summon
to
Lucerne
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
Alice
have
go
up
to
the
bedroom
of
the
lady
who
be
now
to
be
the
subject
of
so
much
anxious
thought
.
<EOS>
when
she
enter
the
room
,
her
friend
be
up
and
in
her
dressing
-
gown
,
lie
on
a
sofa
which
stand
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Alice
,
I
be
so
glad
you
have
come
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
so
want
to
hear
your
voice
.
"
<EOS>
then
Alice
knelt
beside
her
,
and
ask
her
if
she
be
ill
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
not
tell
you
?
<EOS>
but
of
course
he
would
not
.
<EOS>
how
could
he
?
<EOS>
but
,
Alice
,
how
do
he
look
?
<EOS>
do
you
observe
anything
about
him
?
<EOS>
be
he
pleased
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
observe
something
,
and
I
think
he
be
pleased
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
it
?
<EOS>
He
call
me
Alice
.
<EOS>
and
seem
to
be
quite
unlike
himself
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
it
?
<EOS>
He
tell
me
that
I
be
to
come
to
you
instantly
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Alice
,
can
not
you
guess
?
<EOS>
"
then
suddenly
Alice
do
guess
the
secret
,
and
whisper
her
guess
into
Lady
Glencora
's
ear
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
be
so
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
they
will
do
.
<EOS>
They
will
kill
me
by
fuss
over
me
.
<EOS>
if
I
could
go
about
my
work
like
a
washerwoman
,
I
should
be
all
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
happy
,
"
she
say
,
some
two
or
three
hour
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
deny
that
I
be
very
happy
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
though
I
be
destine
to
bring
nothing
but
misery
to
everybody
,
and
I
use
to
wish
myself
dead
so
often
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
wish
myself
dead
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
all
have
to
go
home
,
I
suppose
?
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
say
so
;
 
but
he
seem
to
think
that
I
ought
not
to
travel
above
a
mile
and
a
half
a
day
.
<EOS>
when
I
talk
of
go
down
the
Rhine
in
one
of
the
steamer
,
I
think
he
would
have
go
into
a
fit
.
<EOS>
when
I
ask
him
why
,
he
give
me
such
a
look
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
will
make
a
goose
of
himself
;
 
and
he
will
make
geese
of
us
,
too
;
which
be
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
on
that
afternoon
,
as
they
be
walk
together
,
Mr.
Palliser
tell
the
important
secret
to
his
new
friend
,
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
talk
about
this
great
event
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
matter
,
you
see
,
of
such
immense
importance
to
me
,
"
Mr.
Palliser
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
it
be
,
"
say
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
every
man
feel
that
when
a
child
be
about
to
be
bear
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
but
this
do
not
at
all
satisfy
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
of
course
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
important
thing
to
everybody
;
 
very
important
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
but
,
when
a
man
 
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
Grey
,
I
do
not
think
a
man
be
a
bit
better
because
he
be
rich
,
or
because
he
have
a
title
;
nor
do
I
think
he
be
likely
to
be
in
any
degree
the
happy
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
sure
that
he
have
no
right
to
be
in
the
slight
degree
proud
of
that
which
he
have
have
no
hand
in
do
for
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
man
usually
be
very
proud
of
such
advantage
,
"
say
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
that
I
be
;
I
do
not
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
be
proud
of
some
thing
.
<EOS>
whenever
I
can
manage
to
carry
a
point
in
the
House
,
I
feel
very
proud
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
I
ever
knock
under
to
any
one
,
and
I
be
proud
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
perhaps
,
Mr.
Palliser
be
think
of
a
certain
time
when
his
uncle
the
Duke
have
threaten
him
,
and
he
have
not
give
way
to
the
Duke
's
threat
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
not
think
I
be
proud
because
chance
have
make
me
my
uncle
's
heir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
in
the
least
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
feel
that
a
son
to
me
be
of
more
importance
than
it
be
to
most
man
.
<EOS>
a
strong
anxiety
on
the
subject
,
be
,
I
think
,
more
excusable
in
me
than
it
may
be
in
another
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
I
quite
make
myself
understand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
!
<EOS>
when
there
be
a
dukedom
and
heaven
know
how
many
thousand
a
year
to
be
dispose
of
,
the
question
of
their
future
ownership
do
become
important
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
property
be
so
much
more
interesting
to
one
,
if
one
feel
that
all
one
do
to
it
be
do
for
one
's
own
son
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
yet
,
"
say
Grey
,
"
of
all
the
great
plunderer
of
property
throughout
Europe
,
the
Popes
have
be
the
most
greedy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
be
different
,
when
a
man
can
not
have
a
wife
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
from
all
this
it
may
be
see
that
Mr.
Palliser
and
Mr.
Grey
have
become
very
intimate
.
<EOS>
have
chance
bring
them
together
in
London
<EOS>
they
may
have
meet
a
score
of
time
before
Mr.
Palliser
would
have
think
of
do
more
than
bow
to
such
an
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
may
have
spend
week
at
Matching
,
without
have
achieve
anything
like
intimacy
with
its
noble
owner
.
<EOS>
but
thing
of
that
kind
progress
more
quickly
abroad
than
they
do
at
home
.
<EOS>
the
deck
of
an
ocean
steamer
be
perhaps
the
most
prolific
hotbed
of
the
growth
of
sudden
friendship
;
but
an
hotel
by
the
side
of
a
swiss
lake
do
almost
as
well
.
  
<EOS>
for
some
time
after
this
Lady
Glencora
's
conduct
be
frequently
so
indiscreet
as
to
drive
her
husband
almost
to
frenzy
.
<EOS>
on
the
very
day
after
the
news
have
be
communicate
to
him
,
she
propose
a
picnic
,
and
make
the
proposition
not
only
in
the
presence
of
Alice
,
but
in
that
of
Mr.
Grey
also
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
on
such
an
occasion
,
could
not
express
all
that
he
think
;
but
he
look
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
,
now
,
Plantagenet
?
"
say
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
,
"
say
he
;
 
"
nothing
.
<EOS>
never
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
shall
we
make
this
party
up
to
the
chapel
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
chapel
in
question
be
Tell
's
chapel
 
ever
so
far
up
the
lake
.
<EOS>
a
journey
in
a
steam
-
boat
would
have
be
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
!
"
say
he
,
shout
out
his
refusal
at
her
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
be
angry
about
it
,
"
say
she
;
 
as
though
he
could
have
fail
to
be
stir
by
such
a
proposition
at
such
a
time
.
<EOS>
on
another
occasion
she
return
from
an
evening
walk
,
show
on
her
face
some
sign
of
the
exercise
she
have
take
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
G
 
---
!
<EOS>
Glencora
,
"
say
he
,
"
do
you
mean
to
kill
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
want
her
to
eat
six
or
seven
time
a
day
;
and
always
tell
her
that
she
be
eat
too
much
,
remember
some
ancient
proverb
about
little
and
often
.
<EOS>
He
watch
her
now
as
closely
as
Mrs.
Marsham
and
Mr.
Bott
have
watch
her
before
;
and
she
always
know
that
he
be
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
make
the
matter
bad
by
continually
propose
to
do
thing
which
she
know
he
would
not
permit
,
in
order
that
she
may
enjoy
the
fun
of
see
his
agony
and
amazement
.
<EOS>
but
this
,
though
it
be
fun
to
her
at
the
moment
,
produce
anything
but
fun
,
as
its
general
result
.
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
Alice
,
I
think
this
will
kill
me
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
to
stir
out
of
the
house
now
,
unless
I
go
in
the
carriage
,
or
he
be
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
last
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
you
call
long
.
<EOS>
as
for
walk
with
him
,
it
be
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
He
go
about
a
mile
an
hour
.
<EOS>
and
then
he
make
me
look
so
much
like
a
fool
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
idea
that
he
would
be
such
an
old
coddle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
coddling
will
all
be
give
to
some
one
else
,
very
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
baby
could
possibly
live
through
it
,
if
you
mean
that
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
a
baby
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
suppose
there
will
be
one
,
by
-
and
-
by
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
be
a
fool
!
<EOS>
but
,
if
there
be
,
I
shall
take
that
matter
into
my
own
hand
.
<EOS>
He
can
do
what
he
please
with
me
,
and
I
can
not
help
myself
;
but
I
shall
not
let
him
or
anybody
do
what
they
please
with
my
baby
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
be
about
in
such
matter
a
great
deal
better
than
he
do
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
he
be
a
very
clever
man
in
Parliament
;
but
he
do
not
seem
to
me
to
understand
anything
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
be
make
some
very
wise
speech
in
answer
to
this
,
when
Lady
Glencora
interrupt
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Grey
would
not
make
himself
so
troublesome
,
I
be
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
Alice
hold
her
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
first
consternation
arise
from
the
news
have
somewhat
subside
,
 
say
in
a
fortnight
from
the
day
in
which
Mr.
Palliser
be
make
so
triumphant
,
 
and
when
tiding
have
be
duly
send
to
the
Duke
,
and
an
answer
from
his
grace
have
come
,
arrangement
be
make
for
the
return
of
the
party
to
England
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
's
reply
be
very
short
:
    
my
dear
plantagenet
,
 
<EOS>
give
my
kind
love
to
Glencora
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
a
boy
,
of
course
I
will
be
one
of
the
godfather
.
<EOS>
the
Prince
,
who
be
very
kind
,
will
perhaps
oblige
me
by
be
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
should
advise
you
to
return
as
soon
as
convenient
.
  
<EOS>
Your
affectionate
uncle
,
  
OMNIUM
.
  
<EOS>
that
be
the
letter
;
and
short
as
it
be
,
it
be
probably
the
long
that
Mr.
Palliser
have
ever
receive
from
the
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
great
trouble
about
the
mode
of
their
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
what
nonsense
,
"
say
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
let
us
get
into
an
express
train
,
and
go
right
through
to
London
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
look
at
her
with
a
countenance
full
of
rebuke
and
sorrow
.
<EOS>
He
be
always
so
look
at
her
now
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
mean
,
Plantagenet
,
that
we
be
to
be
drag
all
across
the
Continent
in
that
horrible
carriage
,
and
be
a
thousand
day
on
the
road
,
I
for
one
will
not
submit
to
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
have
never
tell
him
a
word
about
it
,
"
she
say
afterwards
to
Alice
.
"
<EOS>
He
would
never
have
find
it
out
himself
,
till
this
thing
be
all
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
do
at
last
consent
to
take
the
joint
opinion
of
a
swiss
doctor
and
an
English
one
who
be
settle
at
Berne
;
and
who
,
on
the
occasion
,
be
summon
to
Lucerne
.
<EOS>
They
suggest
the
railway
;
and
as
letter
arrive
for
Mr.
Palliser
,
 
medical
letter
,
 
in
which
the
same
opinion
be
broach
,
it
be
agree
,
at
last
,
that
they
should
return
by
railway
;
but
they
be
to
make
various
halt
on
the
road
,
stop
at
each
halt
-
place
for
a
day
.
<EOS>
the
first
be
,
of
course
,
Basle
,
and
from
Basle
they
be
to
go
on
to
Baden
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
particularly
want
to
see
Baden
again
,
"
Lady
Glencora
say
;
"
and
perhaps
I
may
be
able
to
get
back
my
napoleon
.
"
   
<EOS>
show
what
happen
in
the
Churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
these
arrangement
as
to
the
return
of
Mr.
Palliser
's
party
to
London
do
not
,
of
course
,
include
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
They
be
generally
discuss
in
Mr.
Grey
's
absence
,
and
communicate
to
him
by
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
we
shall
see
you
in
England
before
long
?
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
able
to
tell
you
that
before
you
go
,
"
say
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
not
but
that
in
any
event
I
shall
return
to
England
before
the
winter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
come
to
us
at
Matching
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
most
happy
to
have
you
.
<EOS>
say
that
you
will
come
for
the
first
fortnight
in
December
.
<EOS>
after
that
we
always
go
to
the
Duke
,
in
Barsetshire
.
<EOS>
though
,
by
-
the
-
by
,
I
do
not
suppose
we
shall
go
anywhere
this
year
,
"
Mr.
Palliser
add
,
interrupt
the
warmth
of
his
invitation
,
and
reflect
that
,
under
the
present
circumstance
,
perhaps
,
it
may
be
improper
to
have
any
guest
at
match
in
December
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
become
very
fond
of
Mr.
Grey
,
and
on
this
occasion
,
as
he
have
do
on
some
other
,
press
him
warmly
to
make
an
attempt
at
Parliament
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
nearly
so
difficult
as
you
think
,
"
say
he
,
when
Grey
declare
that
he
would
not
know
where
to
look
for
a
seat
.
<EOS>
"
see
the
man
that
get
in
.
<EOS>
there
be
Mr.
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
even
he
get
a
seat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
he
have
to
pay
for
it
very
dearly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
easily
find
some
quiet
little
borough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
quiet
little
borough
have
usually
get
their
own
quiet
little
member
,
"
say
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
fond
of
change
;
and
if
you
like
to
spend
a
thousand
pound
,
the
thing
be
not
difficult
.
<EOS>
I
will
put
you
in
the
way
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Grey
still
decline
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
man
prone
to
be
talk
out
of
his
own
way
of
life
,
and
the
very
fact
that
George
Vavasor
have
be
in
Parliament
would
of
itself
have
go
far
towards
prevent
any
attempt
on
his
part
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
Alice
have
also
want
him
to
go
into
public
life
,
but
he
have
put
aside
her
request
as
though
the
thing
be
quite
out
of
the
question
,
 
never
give
a
moment
to
its
consideration
.
<EOS>
have
she
ask
him
to
settle
himself
and
her
in
Central
Africa
,
his
manner
and
mode
of
refusal
would
have
be
the
same
.
<EOS>
It
be
this
immobility
on
his
part
,
 
this
absolute
want
of
any
of
the
weakness
of
indecision
,
which
have
frighten
her
,
and
drive
her
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
partly
aware
of
this
;
but
that
which
he
have
decline
to
do
at
her
solicitation
,
he
certainly
would
not
do
at
the
advice
of
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
so
it
be
that
he
argue
the
matter
with
himself
.
<EOS>
have
he
now
allow
himself
to
be
so
counsel
,
with
what
terrible
acknowledgement
of
his
own
fault
must
he
not
have
present
himself
before
Alice
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
book
,
then
,
will
be
your
object
in
life
?
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
they
will
be
my
aid
,
"
Grey
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
almost
doubt
whether
any
object
such
as
that
you
mean
be
necessary
for
life
,
or
even
expedient
.
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
that
if
a
man
can
so
train
himself
that
he
may
live
honestly
and
die
fearlessly
,
he
have
do
about
as
much
as
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
do
a
great
deal
,
certainly
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
be
not
ready
enough
to
carry
on
the
argument
as
he
may
have
do
<EOS>
have
more
time
be
give
to
him
to
consider
it
.
<EOS>
He
know
very
well
that
he
himself
be
work
for
other
,
and
not
for
himself
;
and
he
be
aware
,
though
he
have
not
analyse
his
own
conviction
on
the
matter
,
that
good
man
struggle
as
they
do
in
order
that
other
,
besides
themselves
,
may
live
honestly
,
and
,
if
possible
,
die
fearlessly
.
<EOS>
the
recluse
of
Nethercoats
have
think
much
more
about
all
this
than
the
rise
star
of
the
House
of
Commons
;
but
the
philosophy
of
the
rise
star
be
the
well
philosophy
of
the
two
,
though
he
be
by
far
the
less
brilliant
man
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
why
a
man
should
not
live
honestly
and
be
a
Member
of
Parliament
as
well
,
"
continue
Mr.
Palliser
,
when
he
have
be
silent
for
a
few
minute
.
  
<EOS>
"
nor
I
either
,
"
say
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
that
there
be
such
man
,
and
that
the
country
be
under
great
obligation
to
them
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
subject
to
temptation
which
a
prudent
man
like
myself
may
perhaps
do
well
to
avoid
.
"
<EOS>
but
though
he
speak
with
an
assure
tone
,
he
be
shake
,
and
almost
regret
that
he
do
not
accept
the
aid
which
be
offer
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
astonishing
how
strong
a
man
may
be
to
those
around
him
,
 
<EOS>
how
impregnable
may
be
his
exterior
,
while
within
he
feel
himself
to
be
as
weak
as
water
,
and
as
unstable
as
chaff
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
object
which
he
have
now
in
view
be
a
renewal
of
his
engagement
with
Alice
,
and
he
feel
that
he
must
obtain
an
answer
from
her
before
they
leave
Lucerne
.
<EOS>
if
she
still
persist
in
refuse
to
give
him
her
hand
,
it
would
not
be
consistent
with
his
dignity
as
a
man
to
continue
his
immediate
pursuit
of
her
any
longer
.
<EOS>
in
such
case
he
must
leave
her
,
and
see
what
future
time
may
bring
forth
.
<EOS>
He
believe
himself
to
be
aware
that
he
would
never
offer
his
love
to
another
woman
;
and
if
Alice
be
to
remain
single
,
he
may
try
again
,
after
the
lapse
of
a
year
or
two
.
<EOS>
but
if
he
fail
now
,
 
then
,
for
that
year
or
two
,
he
would
see
her
no
more
.
<EOS>
have
so
resolve
,
and
be
averse
to
anything
like
a
surprise
,
he
ask
her
,
as
he
leave
her
one
evening
,
whether
she
would
walk
with
him
on
the
following
morning
.
<EOS>
that
morning
would
be
the
morning
of
her
last
day
at
Lucerne
;
and
as
she
assent
she
know
well
what
be
to
come
.
<EOS>
She
say
nothing
to
Lady
Glencora
on
the
subject
,
but
allow
the
come
prospect
of
the
Palliser
family
to
form
the
sole
subject
of
their
conversation
that
night
,
as
it
have
do
on
every
night
since
the
great
news
have
become
known
.
<EOS>
They
be
always
together
for
an
hour
every
evening
before
Alice
be
allow
to
go
to
bed
,
and
during
this
hour
the
anxiety
of
the
future
father
and
mother
be
always
discuss
till
Alice
Vavasor
be
almost
tired
of
them
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
patient
with
her
friend
,
and
on
this
special
night
she
be
patient
as
ever
.
<EOS>
but
when
she
be
release
and
be
alone
,
she
make
a
great
endeavour
to
come
to
some
fix
resolution
as
to
what
she
would
do
on
the
morrow
,
 
some
resolution
which
should
be
absolutely
resolute
,
and
from
which
no
eloquence
on
the
part
of
any
one
should
move
her
.
<EOS>
but
such
resolution
be
not
easily
reach
,
and
Alice
labour
through
half
the
night
almost
in
vain
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
she
love
the
man
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
he
be
as
true
to
her
as
the
sun
be
true
to
the
earth
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
she
would
be
,
in
all
respect
,
safe
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
Lady
Glencora
would
be
delighted
,
and
her
father
gratify
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
the
countess
would
open
their
arm
to
her
,
 
though
I
doubt
whether
this
knowledge
be
in
itself
very
persuasive
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
by
such
a
marriage
she
would
gain
all
that
woman
generally
look
to
gain
when
they
give
themselves
away
.
<EOS>
but
,
nevertheless
,
as
far
as
she
could
decide
at
all
,
she
decide
against
her
lover
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
right
of
her
own
to
be
take
back
after
the
evil
that
she
have
do
,
and
she
do
not
choose
to
be
take
back
as
an
object
of
pity
and
forgiveness
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
you
go
?
"
say
her
cousin
,
when
she
come
in
with
her
hat
on
,
soon
after
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
to
walk
,
 
with
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
by
appointment
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
by
appointment
.
<EOS>
He
ask
me
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
it
be
all
settle
,
and
you
have
not
tell
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
all
that
be
settle
I
have
tell
you
very
often
.
<EOS>
He
ask
me
yesterday
to
walk
with
him
this
morning
,
and
I
could
not
well
refuse
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
should
you
have
wish
to
refuse
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
say
that
I
do
wish
it
.
<EOS>
but
I
hate
scene
,
and
I
think
it
would
have
be
pleasanter
for
us
to
have
part
without
any
occasion
for
special
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
alice
,
you
be
such
a
fool
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
you
tell
me
very
often
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
he
be
now
go
to
say
the
very
thing
that
he
have
come
all
this
way
for
the
purpose
of
say
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
wonderfully
slow
about
it
;
but
then
slow
as
he
be
,
you
be
slow
.
<EOS>
if
you
do
not
make
it
up
with
him
now
,
I
really
shall
think
you
be
very
wicked
.
<EOS>
I
be
become
like
Lady
Midlothian
;
 
I
can
not
understand
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
want
to
be
his
wife
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
he
want
to
be
your
husband
,
and
the
only
thing
that
keep
you
apart
be
your
obstinacy
,
 
just
because
you
have
say
you
would
not
have
him
.
<EOS>
My
belief
be
that
if
Lady
Midlothian
and
the
rest
of
us
be
to
pat
you
on
the
back
,
and
tell
you
how
right
you
be
,
you
would
ask
him
to
take
you
,
out
of
defiance
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
of
this
,
Alice
;
if
you
refuse
him
now
,
it
will
be
for
the
last
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
,
and
much
more
of
the
same
kind
<EOS>
,
she
bear
before
Mr.
Grey
come
to
take
her
,
and
she
answer
to
it
all
as
little
as
she
could
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
make
me
very
unhappy
,
Glencora
,
"
she
say
once
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
break
you
down
with
unhappiness
,
"
Lady
Glencora
answer
,
"
so
that
he
may
find
you
less
stiff
,
and
hard
,
and
unmanageable
.
"
<EOS>
directly
upon
that
he
come
in
,
look
as
though
he
have
no
business
on
hand
more
exciting
than
his
ordinary
morning
's
tranquil
employment
.
<EOS>
alice
at
once
get
up
to
start
with
him
.
"
<EOS>
so
you
and
Alice
be
go
to
make
your
adieux
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
do
sooner
or
later
,
"
say
Mr.
Grey
;
and
then
they
go
off
.
  
<EOS>
those
who
know
Lucerne
,
 
and
almost
everybody
now
do
know
Lucerne
,
 
will
remember
the
big
hotel
which
have
be
build
close
to
the
landing
-
pier
of
the
steamer
,
and
will
remember
also
the
church
that
stand
upon
a
little
hill
or
rise
ground
,
to
the
left
of
you
,
as
you
come
out
of
the
inn
upon
the
lake
.
<EOS>
the
church
be
immediately
over
the
lake
,
and
round
the
church
there
be
a
burying
-
ground
,
and
skirt
the
burying
-
ground
there
be
cloister
,
through
the
arch
and
aperture
of
which
they
who
walk
and
sit
there
look
down
immediately
upon
the
blue
water
,
and
across
the
water
upon
the
frown
menace
of
Mount
Pilate
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
the
pretty
spot
in
that
land
of
beauty
;
and
its
charm
be
to
my
feeling
enhance
by
the
sepulchral
monument
over
which
I
walk
,
and
by
which
I
be
surround
,
as
I
stand
there
.
<EOS>
up
here
,
into
these
cloister
,
Alice
and
John
Grey
go
together
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
he
have
form
any
purpose
of
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
would
have
go
without
question
in
any
direction
that
he
may
have
lead
her
.
<EOS>
the
distance
from
the
inn
up
to
the
church
-
gate
do
not
take
them
ten
minute
,
and
when
they
be
there
their
walk
be
over
.
<EOS>
but
the
place
be
solitary
,
and
they
be
alone
;
and
it
may
be
as
well
for
Mr.
Grey
to
speak
what
word
he
have
to
say
there
as
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
They
have
often
be
together
in
those
cloister
before
,
but
on
such
occasion
either
Mr.
Palliser
or
Lady
Glencora
have
be
with
them
.
<EOS>
on
their
slow
passage
up
the
hill
very
little
be
speak
,
and
that
little
be
of
no
moment
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
go
in
here
for
a
few
minute
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
prettiest
spot
about
Lucerne
,
and
we
do
not
know
when
we
may
see
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
they
go
in
,
and
sit
down
on
one
of
the
embrasure
that
open
from
the
cloister
over
the
lake
.
  
<EOS>
"
probably
never
again
,
"
say
Alice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
yet
I
have
be
here
now
two
year
run
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
shudder
as
she
remember
that
in
that
former
year
George
Vavasor
have
be
with
her
.
<EOS>
as
she
think
of
it
all
she
hate
herself
.
<EOS>
over
and
over
again
she
have
tell
herself
that
she
have
so
mismanage
the
latter
year
of
her
life
that
it
be
impossible
for
her
not
to
hate
herself
.
<EOS>
no
woman
have
a
clear
idea
of
feminine
constancy
than
she
have
,
and
no
woman
have
sin
against
that
idea
more
deeply
.
<EOS>
He
give
her
time
to
think
of
all
this
as
he
sit
there
look
down
upon
the
water
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
yet
I
would
sooner
live
in
Cambridgeshire
,
"
be
the
first
word
he
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
partly
because
all
beauty
be
best
enjoy
when
it
be
seek
for
with
some
trouble
and
difficulty
,
and
partly
because
such
beauty
,
and
the
romance
which
be
attach
to
it
,
should
not
make
up
the
staple
of
one
's
life
.
<EOS>
romance
,
if
it
be
to
come
at
all
,
should
always
come
by
fit
and
start
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
live
in
a
pretty
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
would
like
to
live
a
romantic
life
,
 
no
doubt
;
but
all
those
thing
lose
their
charm
if
they
be
make
common
.
<EOS>
when
a
man
have
to
go
to
Vienna
or
St.
Petersburg
two
or
three
time
a
month
,
you
do
not
suppose
he
enjoy
travel
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
all
the
same
,
I
should
like
to
live
in
a
pretty
country
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
want
you
to
come
and
live
in
a
very
ugly
country
.
<EOS>
"
then
he
pause
for
a
minute
or
two
,
not
look
at
her
,
but
gaze
still
on
the
mountain
opposite
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
speak
a
word
,
but
look
as
he
be
look
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
the
request
be
come
,
and
have
be
think
about
it
all
night
;
but
now
that
it
have
come
she
do
not
know
how
to
bear
herself
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think

"
he
go
on
to
say
,
"
that
you
would
let
that
consideration
stand
in
your
way

if
on
other
ground
you
be
willing

become
my
wife

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
consideration
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
because
Nethercoats
be
not
so
pretty
as
Lucerne

<EOS>
"
  
"
It
would
have
nothing

Alice

It

nothing

twelve
month

you

at

mine

It

They
do
not

I
have
<EOS>

one

I
could
speak

they
tell
me
that

I

be
to

unforgiven

I
think
you

foolish

misguided

lead
away
by
a
vain
ambition

that
in
the
difficulty
to

bring
you

you
endeavour
to
constrain
yourself
to
do
an
act

which
,
when
it
come
near

you

when
the
doing

now
,
as

speak
thus

she
turn
her
eye
upon
him

look
at

wonder

accurately

I
never

that
trouble

blind
you

awhile

You
have
drive
yourself
to
revolt
against

upon
that
your

misgave

you
say
to
yourself

how
you
may
throw
away
all
your

<EOS>
You
see

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

no

no

the
storm
pass
over

nothing

<EOS>
what

she
say
to
him

<EOS>
"
My

much
great

he
go
on

than
when

first
ask

I

You

<EOS>
then
he
stop
his
speech
,
and
wait
for
a
reply

but
Alice
sit
silent
beneath
his
gaze
,
with
her
eye
turn
upon
the
tombstone
beneath
her
foot
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
have
no
choice

to
yield

<EOS>
He
,
possess
of
power
and
force
infinitely
great
than
her
,
have
leave
her
no
alternative
but
to
be
happy
.
<EOS>
but
there
still
clung
to
her
what
I
fear
we
must
call
a
perverseness
of
obstinacy
,
a
desire
to
maintain
the
resolution
she
have
make
,
 
a
wish
that
she
may
be
allow
to
undergo
the
punishment
she
have
deserve
.
<EOS>
She
be
as
a
prisoner
who
would
fain
cling
to
his
prison
after
pardon
have
reach
him
,
because
he
be
conscious
that
the
pardon
be
undeserved
.
<EOS>
and
it
may
be
that
there
be
still
leave
within
her
bosom
some
remnant
of
that
feeling
of
rebellion
which
his
masterful
spirit
have
ever
produce
in
her
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
imperious
in
his
tranquillity
,
he
argue
his
question
of
love
with
such
a
manifest
preponderance
of
right
on
his
side
,
that
she
have
always
feel
that
to
yield
to
him
would
be
to
confess
the
omnipotence
of
his
power
.
<EOS>
She
know
now
that
she
must
yield
to
him
,
 
that
his
power
over
her
be
omnipotent
.
<EOS>
She
be
press
by
him
as
in
some
country
the
prisoner
be
press
by
the
judge
,
 
so
pressed
that
she
acknowledge
to
herself
silently
that
any
further
antagonism
to
him
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
the
word
which
she
have
to
speak
still
remain
unspoken
,
and
he
stand
over
her
,
wait
for
her
answer
.
<EOS>
then
slowly
he
sit
down
beside
her
,
and
gradually
he
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
.
<EOS>
She
shrink
from
him
,
back
against
the
stonework
of
the
embrasure
,
but
she
could
not
shrink
away
from
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
She
put
up
her
hand
to
impede
his
,
but
his
hand
,
like
his
character
and
his
word
,
be
full
of
power
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
impede
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
he
say
,
as
he
press
her
close
with
his
arm
,
"
the
battle
be
over
now
,

I
have
win
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
win
everything

she

whisper
to

shrink
from
his

<EOS>
"
in
win
you
I
have
win
everything

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
he
put
his
face
over
her
and
press
his
lip
to
hers
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
he
be
make
happy
when
he
know
that
no
other
touch
have
profane
those
lip
since
last
he
have
press
them

<EOS>
Rouge

<EOS>
Alice
insist
on
be
leave
up
in
the
churchyard
,
urge
that
she
want
to
"
think
about
it
all
,
"
but
,
in
truth
,
fear
that
she
may
not
be
able
to
carry
herself
well
,
if
she
be
to
walk
down
with
her
lover
to
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
to
this
he
make
no
objection
,
and
,
on
reach
the
inn
,
meet
Mr.
Palliser
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
be
already
inspect
the
arrangement
of
certain
large
trunk
which
have
be

down

stair
,
and
be

departure

<EOS>
He
be
go
about
the
house
,
with
a
nervous
solicitude
to
do
something
,
and
be
flatter
himself
that
he
be
of
use
.
<EOS>
as
he
could
not
be
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
and
as
,
by
the
nature
of
his
disposition
,
some
employment
be
necessary
to
him
,
he
be
look
to
the
cording
of
the
box
.
"
<EOS>
good
morning
!
<EOS>
good
morning
!

"
<EOS>
he
say
to
Grey
,
hardly
look
at
him
,
as
though
time
be
too
precious
with
him
to
allow
of
his
turn
his
eye
upon
his
friend
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
go
up
to
the
station
to
see
after
a
carriage
for
to

morrow
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
will
come
with
me
.
"
<EOS>
to
this
proposition
Mr.
Grey
assent
.
<EOS>
"
sometimes
,
you
know
,
"
continue
Mr.
Palliser
,
"
the
spring
of
the
carriage
be
so
very
rough
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
,
in
a
very
few
word
,
Mr.
Grey
tell
him
what
have
be
his
own
morning
's
work
.
<EOS>
He
hate
secret
and
secrecy
,
and
as
the
Pallisers
know
well
what
have
bring
him
upon
their
track
,
it
be
,
he
think
,
well
that
they
should
know
that
he
have
be
successful
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
congratulate
him
very
cordially
,
and
then
,
run
up
-
stair
for
his
glove
or
his
stick
,
or
,
more
probably
,
that
he
may
give
his
wife
one
other
caution
as
to
her
care
of
herself
,
he
tell
her
also
that
Alice
have
yield
at
last

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
of

she
have
,
"
say
Lady

<EOS>
"
I
really
do
not
think
she
would
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
because
you
do
not
understand
thing
of
that
sort

say
his

.
<EOS>
then
the
caution
be
repeat
,
the
mother
of
the
future
duke
be
kiss
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
go
off
on
his
mission
about
the
carriage
,
its
cushion
,
and
its
spring
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
their
walk
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
suggest
that
,
as
thing
be
settle
so
pleasantly
,
Mr.
Grey
may
as
well
return
with
them
to
England
,
and
to
this
suggestion
Mr.
Grey
assent
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
remain
alone
for
nearly
an
hour
,
look
out
upon
the
rough
side
and
gloomy
top
of
Mount
Pilate
.
<EOS>
no
one
disturb
her
in
the
churchyard
,
 
<EOS>
no
step
be
hear
along
the
tombstone
,
 
no
voice
sound
through
the
cloister
.
<EOS>
She
be
leave
in
perfect
solitude
to
think
of
the
past
,
and
form
her
plan
of
the
future
.
<EOS>
be
she
happy
<EOS>
,
now
that
the
manner
of
her
life
to
come
be
thus
settle
for
her
;
that
all
further
question
as
to
the
disposal
of
herself
be
take
out
of
her
hand
,
and
that
her
marriage
with
a
man
she
love
be
so
firmly
arrange
that
no
further
folly
of
her
own
could
disarrange
it
?
<EOS>
She
be
happy
,
though
she
be
slow
to
confess
her
happiness
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
be
happy
,
and
she
be
resolute
in
this
,
 
that
she
would
now
do
all
she
could
to
make
him
happy
also
.
<EOS>
and
there
must
now
,
she
acknowledge
,
be
an
end
to
her
pride
,
 
to
that
pride
which
have
hitherto
teach
her
to
think
that
she
could
more
wisely
follow
her
own
guidance
than
that
of
any
other
who
may
claim
to
guide
her
.
<EOS>
She
know
now
that
she
must
follow
his
guidance
.
<EOS>
She
have
find
her
master
,
as
we
sometimes
say
,
and
laugh
to
herself
with
a
little
inward
laughter
as
she
confess
that
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
She
be
from
henceforth
altogether
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
if
he
choose
to
tell
her
that
they
be
to
be
marry
at
Michaelmas
,
or
at
Christmas
,
or
on
Lady
Day
,
they
would
,
of
course
,
be
marry
accordingly
.
<EOS>
She
have
take
her
fling
at
have
her
own
will
,
and
she
and
all
her
friend
have
see
what
have
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
have
assume
the
command
of
the
ship
,
and
have
throw
it
upon
the
rock
,
and
she
feel
that
she
never
ought
to
take
the
captain
's
place
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
for
her
that
he
who
be
to
be
captain
be
one
whom
she
respect
as
thoroughly
as
she
love
him
.
  
<EOS>
She
would
write
to
her
father
at
once
,
 
to
her
father
and
Lady
Macleod
,
 
and
would
confess
everything
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
owe
it
to
them
that
they
should
be
tell
by
herself
that
they
have
be
right
and
that
she
have
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
hitherto
<EOS>
she
have
not
mention
to
either
of
them
the
fact
that
Mr.
Grey
be
with
them
in
Switzerland
.
<EOS>
and
,
then
,
what
must
she
do
as
to
Lady
Midlothian
?
<EOS>
as
to
Lady
Midlothian
,
she
would
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
Lady
Midlothian
,
of
course
,
would
triumph
;
 
would
jump
upon
her
,
as
Lady
Glencora
have
once
express
it
,
with
very
triumphant
heel
,
 
would
try
to
patronize
her
,
or
,
which
would
be
almost
bad
,
would
make
a
parade
of
her
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
but
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
Lady
Midlothian
,
unless
,
indeed
,
Mr.
Grey
should
order
it
.
<EOS>
then
she
laugh
at
herself
again
with
that
inward
laughter
,
and
,
rise
from
her
seat
,
proceed
to
walk
down
the
hill
to
the
hotel
.
  
<EOS>
"
vanquish
at
last
!
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
as
Alice
enter
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
vanquish
;
if
you
like
to
call
it
so
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
what
I
call
it
,
but
what
you
feel
it
,
"
say
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
think
that
I
do
not
know
you
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
you
regard
yourself
now
as
an
unfortunate
prisoner
,
 
as
a
captive
take
in
war
,
to
be
lead
away
in
triumph

without
any

<EOS>
I

you
triumph
in

on

at

me

something

it

I
do
wish
you
joy
all
the

and
you
may
say
what
you
please
.
<EOS>
He
have
get
you
in
his
power
now
,
and
I
do
not
think
even
you
can
go
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
shall
not
go
back
again

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
join
with
Lady
Midlothian
in
put
you
into
a
madhouse
,
if
you
do
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
so
glad
;
I
be
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
to
the
last
,
 
terribly
afraid
;
you
be
so
hard
and
so
proud
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
hard
to
me
,
dear
.
<EOS>
You
have
never
be
half
hard
enough
to
me
.
<EOS>
but
you
be
hard
to
yourself
,
and
,
upon
my
word
,
you
have
be
hard
to
him
.
<EOS>
what
a
deal
you
will
have
to
make
up
to
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
that
I
ought
to
stand
before
him
always
as
a
penitent
,
 
in
a
white
sheet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
like
it
better
,
I
dare
say
,
if
you
will
sit
upon
his
knee
.
<EOS>
some
penitent
do
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
and
how
happy
you
will
be
!
<EOS>
He
will
never
explain
the
sugar
-
duty
to
you
,
and
there
will
be
no
Mr.
Bott
at
Nethercoats

<EOS>
"
They
sit
together
the
whole
morning
,
 
while
Mr.
Palliser
be
see
to
the
spring
and
cushion
,
 
and
by
degree
Alice
begin
to
enjoy
her
happiness
.
<EOS>
as
she
do
so
her
friend
enjoy
it
with
her
,
and
at
last
they
have
something
of
the
comfort
and
excitement
which
such
an
occasion
should
give
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
,
Alice
;
you
shall
come
and
be
marry
at
Matching
,
in
August
,
or
perhaps
September
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
only
way
in
which
I
can
be
present
;
and
if
we
can
bespeak
some
sun
,
we
will
have
the
breakfast
out
in
the
ruin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
on
the
follow
morning
they
all
start
together
,
a
first
-
class
compartment
have
be
take
for
the
Palliser
family
,
and
a
second
-
class
compartment
close
to
them
for
the
Palliser
servant
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
as
he
slowly
hand
his
wife
in
,
be
a
triumphant
man
;
as
be
also
Mr.
Grey
,
as
he
hand
in
his
lady
-
love
,
though
,
in
a
manner
,
much
less
manifest
.
<EOS>
We
may
say
that
both
the
gentleman
have
be
very
fortunate
while
at
Lucerne
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
have
come
abroad
with
a
feeling
that
all
the
world
have
be
cut
from
under
his
foot
.
<EOS>
a
great
change
be
need
for
his
wife
,
and
he
have
acknowledge
at
once
that
everything
must
be
make
to
yield
to
that
necessity
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
have
his
reward
,
 
now
in
his
triumphant
return
.
<EOS>
terrible
trouble
have
afflict
him
as
he
go
,
which
seem
now
to
have
dissipate
themselves
altogether
.
<EOS>
when
he
think
of
Burgo
Fitzgerald
he
remember
him
only
as
a
poor
,
unfortunate
fellow
,
for
whom
he
should
be
glad
to
do
something
,
if
the
doing
of
anything
be
only
in
his
power
;
and
he
have
in
his
pocket
a
letter
which
he
have
that
morning
receive
from
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
,
mark
private
and
confidential
,
which
be
in
its
nature
very
private
and
confidential
,
and
in
which
he
be
tell
that
Lord
Brock
and
Mr.
Finespun
be
totally
at
variance
about
french
wine
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Finespun
want
to
do
something
,
now
in
the
recess
,
 
to
send
some
political
agent
over
to
France
,
 
to
which
Lord
Brock
would
not
agree
;
and
no
one
know
what
would
be
the
consequence
of
this
disagreement
.
<EOS>
here
may
be
another
chance
,
 
if
only
Mr.
Palliser
could
give
up
his
winter
in
Italy
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
as
he
take
his
place
opposite
his
wife
,
be
very
triumphant
.
  
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Grey
be
triumphant
,
as
he
place
himself
gently
in
his
seat
opposite
to
Alice
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
assume
no
right
,
as
he
take
that
position
apparently
because
it
be
the
one
which
come
naturally
to
his
lot
.
<EOS>
no
one
would
have
be
make
aware
that
Alice
be
his
own
simply
by
see
his
arrangement
for
her
comfort
.
<EOS>
He
make
no
loud
assertion
as
to
his
property
and
his
right
,
as
some
man
do
.
<EOS>
He
be
quiet
and
subdue
in
his
joy
,
but
not
the
less
be
he
triumphant
.
<EOS>
from
the
day
on
which
Alice
have
accept
his
first
offer
,
 
nay
,
from
an
early
day
than
that
;
from
the
day
on
which
he
have
first
resolve
to
make
it
,
down
to
the
present
hour
,
he
have
never
be
stir
from
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
by
every
word
that
he
have
say
,
and
by
every
act
that
he
have
do
,
he
have
show
himself
to
be
unmove
by
that
episode
in
their
joint
life
,
which
Alice
's
other
friend
have
regard
as
so
fatal
.
<EOS>
when
she
first
reject
him
,
he
would
not
take
his
rejection
.
<EOS>
when
she
tell
him
that
she
intend
to
marry
her
cousin
,
he
silently
decline
to
believe
that
such
marriage
would
ever
take
place
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
give
her
up
for
a
day
,
and
now
the
event
prove
that
he
have
be
right
.
<EOS>
Alice
be
happy
,
very
happy
;
but
she
be
still
disposed
to
regard
her
lover
as
Fate
,
and
her
happiness
as
an
enforced
necessity
.
  
<EOS>
They
stop
a
night
at
Basle
,
and
again
she
stand
upon
the
balcony
.
<EOS>
He
be
close
to
her
as
she
stand
there
,
 
so
close
that
,
put
out
her
hand
for
his
,
she
be
able
to
take
it
and
press
it
closely
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
think
of
something
,
Alice
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
here
,
"
she
say
 
"
here
,
on
this
very
balcony
,
that
I
first
rebel
against
you
,
and
now
you
have
bring
me
here
that
I
should
confess
and
submit
on
the
same
spot
.
<EOS>
I
do
confess
.
<EOS>
how
be
I
to
thank
you
for
forgive
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
on
the
follow
morning
they
go
on
to
Baden
-
Baden
,
and
there
they
stop
for
a
couple
of
day
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
have
positively
refuse
to
stop
a
day
at
Basle
,
make
so
many
objection
to
the
place
that
her
husband
have
at
last
yield
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
go
from
Vienna
to
London
without
feel
it
,
"
she
say
,
with
indignation
;
"
and
to
tell
me
that
I
can
not
do
two
easy
day
"
journey
run
!
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
have
be
afraid
to
be
imperious
,
and
therefore
,
immediately
on
his
arrival
at
one
of
the
station
in
Basle
,
he
have
post
across
the
town
,
in
the
heat
and
the
dust
,
to
look
after
the
cushion
and
the
spring
at
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
particular
favour
to
ask
of
you
,
"
Lady
Glencora
say
to
her
husband
,
as
soon
as
they
be
alone
together
in
their
room
at
Baden
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
declare
that
he
would
grant
her
any
particular
favour
,
 
only
premise
that
he
be
not
to
be
suppose
to
have
thereby
commit
himself
to
any
engagement
under
which
his
wife
should
have
authority
to
take
any
exertion
upon
herself
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
be
a
milkmaid
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
be
not
a
milkmaid
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
be
bring
up
like
a
milkmaid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
what
be
the
favour
?
<EOS>
if
she
would
only
ask
for
jewel
,
 
though
they
be
the
Grand
Duchess
's
diamond
eardrop
,
he
would
endeavour
to
get
them
for
her
.
<EOS>
if
she
would
have
quaff
molten
pearl
,
like
Cleopatra
,
he
would
have
procure
the
beverage
,
 
have
first
fortify
himself
with
a
medical
opinion
as
to
the
fitness
of
the
drink
for
a
lady
in
her
condition
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
expenditure
that
he
would
not
willingly
incur
for
her
,
nothing
costly
that
he
would
grudge
.
<EOS>
but
when
she
ask
for
a
favour
,
he
be
always
afraid
of
an
imprudence
.
<EOS>
very
possibly
she
may
want
to
drink
beer
in
an
open
garden
.
  
<EOS>
and
her
request
be
,
at
last
,
of
this
nature
:
"
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
take
me
up
to
the
gambling
-
room
!
"
<EOS>
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
gambling
-
room
!
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
in
dismay
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Plantagenet
;
the
gambling
-
room
.
<EOS>
if
you
have
be
with
me
before
,
I
should
not
have
make
a
fool
of
myself
by
put
my
piece
of
money
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
the
place
;
but
then
I
see
nothing
,
because
I
be
so
frightened
when
I
find
that
I
be
win
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
be
aware
that
all
the
world
of
Baden
,
 
or
rather
the
world
of
the
stranger
at
Baden
,
 
assemble
itself
in
those
salon
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
also
that
he
himself
be
curious
to
see
how
man
look
when
they
lose
their
own
money
,
or
win
that
of
other
.
<EOS>
He
know
how
a
Minister
look
when
he
lose
or
gain
a
tax
.
<EOS>
He
be
familiar
with
million
and
ten
of
million
in
a
committee
of
the
whole
House
.
<EOS>
He
know
the
excitement
of
a
near
division
upon
the
estimate
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
never
yet
see
a
poor
man
stake
his
last
napoleon
,
and
rake
back
from
off
the
table
a
small
hatful
of
gold
.
<EOS>
a
little
exercise
after
an
early
dinner
be
,
he
have
be
tell
,
good
for
his
wife
;
and
he
agree
therefore
that
,
on
their
second
evening
at
Baden
,
they
would
all
walk
up
and
see
the
play
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
shall
get
back
my
napoleon
,
"
say
Glencora
to
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
perhaps
I
shall
be
forgive
when
somebody
see
how
difficult
it
be
to
manage
you
,
"
say
Alice
,
look
at
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
not
in
earnest
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
,
almost
fear
the
result
of
the
experiment
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
They
start
together
,
Mr.
Palliser
with
his
wife
,
and
Mr.
Grey
with
Alice
on
his
arm
,
and
find
all
the
table
at
work
.
<EOS>
They
at
first
walk
through
the
different
room
,
whisper
to
each
other
their
comment
on
the
people
that
they
see
,
and
listen
to
the
quick
,
low
,
monotonous
word
of
the
croupier
as
they
arrange
and
preside
over
the
game
.
<EOS>
each
table
be
closely
surround
by
its
own
crowd
,
make
up
of
player
,
embryo
player
,
and
simple
looker
-
on
,
so
that
they
could
not
see
much
as
they
walk
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
enough
for
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
She
be
anxious
to
know
what
these
man
and
woman
be
do
,
 
to
see
whether
the
croupier
wear
horn
on
their
head
and
be
devil
indeed
,
 
to
behold
the
face
of
those
who
be
wretched
and
of
those
who
be
triumphant
,
 
to
know
how
the
thing
be
do
,
and
to
learn
something
of
that
lesson
in
life
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
let
us
stand
here
a
moment
,
"
she
say
to
her
husband
,
arrest
him
at
one
corner
of
the
table
which
have
the
great
crowd
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
able
to
see
in
a
few
minute
.
"
<EOS>
so
he
stand
with
her
there
,
give
way
to
Alice
,
who
go
in
front
with
his
wife
;
and
in
a
minute
or
two
an
aperture
be
make
,
so
that
they
could
all
see
the
marked
cloth
,
and
the
money
lie
about
,
and
the
rake
on
the
table
,
and
the
croupier
skilfully
deal
his
card
,
and
,
 
more
interesting
than
all
the
rest
,
the
face
of
those
who
be
play
.
<EOS>
Grey
look
on
,
over
Alice
's
shoulder
,
very
attentively
,
 
as
do
Palliser
also
,
 
but
both
of
them
keep
their
eye
upon
the
minister
of
the
work
.
<EOS>
Alice
and
Glencora
do
the
same
at
first
,
but
as
they
gain
courage
they
glance
round
upon
the
gambler
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
table
,
have
,
of
course
,
four
corner
,
and
<EOS>
at
the
corner
appropriate
by
them
they
be
partly
opposite
to
the
man
who
deal
the
card
.
<EOS>
the
corner
answer
to
theirs
at
the
other
end
be
the
part
of
the
table
most
remove
from
their
sight
,
and
that
on
which
their
eye
fall
last
.
<EOS>
as
Lady
Glencora
stand
she
could
hardly
see
,
 
indeed
,
at
first
she
could
not
see
,
 
one
or
two
who
be
congregate
at
this
spot
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
be
behind
her
,
could
not
see
them
at
all
.
<EOS>
but
to
Alice
,
 
and
to
Mr.
Grey
,
have
he
care
about
it
,
 
every
face
at
the
table
be
visible
except
the
face
of
those
who
be
immediately
close
to
them
.
<EOS>
before
long
Alice
's
attention
be
rivet
on
the
action
and
countenance
of
one
young
man
who
sit
at
that
other
corner
.
<EOS>
He
be
lean
,
at
first
listlessly
,
over
the
table
,
dress
in
a
velveteen
jacket
,
and
with
his
round
-
top
hat
bring
far
over
his
eye
,
so
that
she
could
not
fully
see
his
face
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
hardly
begin
to
observe
him
before
he
throw
back
his
hat
,
and
take
some
piece
of
gold
from
under
his
left
hand
,
which
lie
upon
the
table
,
push
three
or
four
of
them
on
to
one
of
the
division
mark
on
the
cloth
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
show
no
care
,
as
other
do
,
as
to
the
special
spot
which
they
should
occupy
.
<EOS>
many
be
very
particular
in
this
respect
,
place
their
venture
on
the
line
,
so
as
to
share
the
fortune
of
two
compartment
,
or
sometimes
of
four
;
or
they
divide
their
coin
,
take
three
or
four
number
,
select
the
number
with
almost
grotesque
attention
to
some
imagine
rule
of
their
own
.
<EOS>
but
this
man
let
his
gold
go
all
together
,
and
leave
it
where
his
half
-
stretch
rake
deposit
it
by
chance
.
<EOS>
Alice
could
not
but
look
at
his
face
.
<EOS>
His
eye
she
could
see
be
bloodshot
,
and
his
hair
,
when
he
push
back
his
hat
,
be
rough
and
dishevelled
;
but
still
there
be
that
in
his
face
which
no
woman
could
see
and
not
regard
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
face
which
at
once
prepossess
her
in
his
favour
,
 
as
it
have
always
prepossess
all
other
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
he
have
win
his
money
,
and
Alice
see
him
drag
it
in
as
lazily
as
he
have
push
it
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
see
that
little
Frenchman
?
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
He
have
just
make
half
a
napoleon
,
and
have
walk
off
with
it
.
<EOS>
be
not
it
interesting
?
<EOS>
I
could
stay
here
all
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
then
she
turn
round
to
whisper
something
to
her
husband
,
and
Alice
's
eye
again
fall
on
the
face
of
the
man
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
after
he
have
win
his
money
,
he
have
allow
the
game
to
go
on
for
a
turn
without
any
action
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
the
gold
again
go
under
his
hand
,
and
he
lounge
forward
with
his
hat
over
his
eye
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
croupier
have
say
a
word
,
as
though
call
his
attention
to
the
game
,
but
he
have
merely
shake
his
head
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
fate
of
the
next
turn
have
be
decide
,
he
again
rouse
himself
,
and
on
this
occasion
,
as
far
as
Alice
could
see
,
push
his
whole
stock
forward
with
the
rake
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
mass
of
gold
,
and
,
from
his
manner
of
place
it
,
all
may
see
that
he
leave
its
position
to
chance
.
<EOS>
one
piece
have
get
beyond
its
boundary
,
and
the
croupier
push
it
back
with
some
half
-
express
inquiry
as
to
his
correctness
.
<EOS>
"
all
right
,
"
say
a
voice
in
English
.
<EOS>
then
Lady
Glencora
start
and
clutch
Alice
's
arm
with
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
be
explain
to
Mr.

,
behind
them
,
something
about
german

as
connect
with
gambling

table
,
and
do
not
hear
the
voice
,
or
see
his
wife
's
motion
.
<EOS>
I
need
hardly
tell
the
reader
that
the
gambler
be
Burgo
Fitzgerald
.
  
<EOS>
but
Lady
Glencora
say
not
a
word
,
 
not
as
yet
.
<EOS>
She
look
forward
very
gently
,
but
still
with
eager
eye
,
till
she
could
just
see
the
face
she
know
so
well
.
<EOS>
His
hat
be
now
push
back
,
and
his
countenance
have
lose
its
listlessness
.
<EOS>
He
watch
narrowly
the
face
of
the
man
as
he
tell
out
the
amount
of
the
card
as
they
be
deal
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
try
to
hide
his
anxiety
,
and
when
,
after
the
telling
of
some
six
or
seven
card
,
he
hear
a
certain
number
name
,
and
a
certain
colour
call
,
he
make
some
exclamation
which
even
Glencora
could
not
hear
.
<EOS>
and
then
another
croupier
put
down
,
close
to
Burgo
's
money
,
certain
roll
of
gold
do
up
in
paper
,
and
also
certain
loose
napoleon
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
do

"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
take

"
say
Alice
,
not
at
all
know
the
cause
of
her
cousin
's
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
Burgo
have
pause
a
moment
,
and
then
prepare
to
rake
the
money
to
him
;
but
as
he
do
so
,
he
change
his
mind
,
and
push
it
all
back
again
,
 
now
,
on
this
occasion
,
be
very
careful
to
place
it
on
its
former
spot
.
<EOS>
both
Alice
and
Glencora
could
see
that
a
man
at
his
elbow
be
dissuade
him
,
 
have
even
attempt
to
stop
the
arm
which
hold
the
rake
.
<EOS>
but
Burgo
shake
him
off
,
speak
to
him
some
word
roughly
,
and
then
again
he
steady
the
roll
upon
their
appoint
place
.
<EOS>
the
croupier
who
have
pause
for
a
moment
now
go
on
quickly
with
his
card
,
and
in
two
minute
the
fate
of
Burgo
's
wealth
be
decide
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
draw
back
by
the
croupier
's
unimpassioned
rake
,
and
the
roll
of
gold
be
restore
to
the
tray
from
whence
they
have
be
take
.
  
<EOS>
Burgo
look
up
and
smile
at
them
all
round
the
table
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
most
of
those
who
stand
around
be
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
who
gather
eye
upon
him
wherever
he
may
be
,
or
whatever
he
be
do
;
and
it
have
be
clear
that
he
be
very
intent
upon
his
fortune
,
and
on
the
last
occasion
the
amount
stake
have
be
considerable
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
man
and
woman
be
look
at
him
,
and
therefore
he
smile
faintly
as
he
turn
his
eye
round
the
table
.
<EOS>
then
he
get
up
,
and
,
put
his
hand
in
his
trouser
pocket
,
whistle
as
he
walk
away
.
<EOS>
His
companion
follow
him
,
and
lay
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
;
but
Burgo
shake
him
off
,
and
would
not
turn
round
.
<EOS>
He
shake
him
off
,
and
walk
on
whistle

the
length
of
the
whole

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
Mr.

so
deep
into

that
he

<EOS>
"
Alice

to
misfortune
,
he
be
not
successful
in
his
attempt
to
bear
his
loss
with
a
show
of
indifference

<EOS>
the
motion
of
his
head
,
the
position
of
his
hand
,
the
tone
of
his
whistling
,
all
tell
the
tale
.
<EOS>
even
the
unimpassioned
croupier
furtively
cast
an
eye
after
him
,
and
a
very
big
Guard
,
in
a
cocked
hat
,
and
uniform
,
and
sword
,
who
hitherto
have
hardly
be

<EOS>
if
there
be
to
be
a
tragedy
at
these
place
,
 
and
tragedy
will
sometimes
occur

it
be
always
as
well
that
the
tragic
scene
should
be
as
far
remove
as
possible
from
the

in
order
that
the
public

Lady

Alice
have
leave
their

turn
round
upon

<EOS>
He

Burgo

perceive

walk
up

frequently
fancy

They
continue
to
walk
on
up

it

some
time

explain
to
his

that
the
order
have
be
give
,
in

peremptory
way

by
himself

he
be
anxious

His

sir

only
his
friend

<EOS>
that
is

I
be
the
head
Commissionaire

<EOS>
I
look
after
the
gentleman
who
sometimes
be
not
all
 
not
all
 
<EOS>
"
exactly
what
they
should
be
,
the
commissioner
intend
to
explain
;
and
Mr.
Palliser
understand
him
although
the
word
be
not
quite
speak
.
<EOS>
the
interview
be
end
by
Mr.
Palliser
take
the
name
of
the
hotel
,
and
promise
to
call
before
Mr.
Fitzgerald
should
be
up
in
the
morning
 
a
purposed
visit
,
which
we
need
not
regard
as
require
any
very
early
energy
on
Mr.
Palliser
's
part
,
when
we
remember
Burgo
's
own
programme
for
the
follow
day
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
receive
her
husband
that
night
with
infinite
anxiety
,
and
be
by
no
mean
satisfied
with
what
have
be
do
.
<EOS>
He
describe
to
her
as
accurately
as
he
could
the
nature
of
his
interview
with
Burgo
,
and
he
describe
to
her
also
his
other
interview
with
the
head
commissioner
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
;
he
will
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
;
when
she
hear
from
her
husband
<EOS>
the
man
's
surmise
that
perhaps
he
may
destroy
himself
.
"
<EOS>
He
will
;
he
will
;
and
if
he
do
,
how
can
you
expect
that
I
shall
bear
it
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
try
to
soothe
her
by
tell
her
of
his
promised
visit
to
the
landlord
;
and
Lady
Glencora
,
accept
this
as
something
,
strove
to
instigate
her
husband
to
some
lavish
expenditure
on
Burgo
's
behalf
.
<EOS>
"
there
can
be
no
reason
why
he
should
not
take
it
,
"
say
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
none
the
least
.
<EOS>
have
it
not
be
promise
to
him
?
<EOS>
have
he
not
a
right
to
it
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
subject
be
one
which
Mr.
Palliser
find
it
very
hard
to
discuss
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
tell
his
wife
that
Fitzgerald
ought
to
accept
his
bounty
;
but
he
assure
her
that
his
money
should
be
forthcoming
,
almost
to
any
extent
,
if
it
could
be
make
available
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
follow
morning
he
go
down
to
the
hotel
,
and
see
the
real
landlord
.
<EOS>
He
find
him
to
be
a
reasonable
,
tranquil
,
and
very
good
-
natured
man
,
 
who
be
possess
by
a
not
irrational
desire
that
his
customer
"
bill
should
be
pay
;
but
who
seem
to
be
much
less
eager
on
the
subject
than
be
english
landlord
in
general
.
<EOS>
His
chief
anxiety
seem
to
arise
from
the
great
difficulty
of
do
anything
with
the
gentleman
who
be
now
lie
in
his
bed
up
-
stair
.
"
<EOS>
have
he
have
any
breakfast
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
Breakfast
!
<EOS>
oh
yes
;
"
and
the
landlord
laugh
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
very
particular
in
the
order
he
have
give
.
<EOS>
He
have
desire
his
cutlet
to
be
dress
in
a
particular
way
,
 
with
a
great
deal
of
cayenne
pepper
,
and
they
have
be
so
dressed
.
<EOS>
He
have
order
a
bottle
of
Sauterne
;
but
the
landlord
have
think
,
or
the
head
-
waiter
act
for
him
have
think
,
that
a
bottle
of
ordinary
wine
of
the
country
would
do
as
well
.
<EOS>
the
bottle
of
ordinary
wine
of
the
country
have
just
that
moment
be
send
up
-
stair
.
  
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Palliser
sit
down
in
the
landlord
's
little
room
,
and
have
Burgo
Fitzgerald
's
bill
bring
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
may
venture
to
pay
it
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
as
monsieur
pleased
,
"
say
the
landlord
,
with
something
like
a
sparkle
in
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
Mr.
Palliser
to
do
?
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
whether
,
in
accordance
with
the
rule
of
the
world
in
which
he
live
,
he
ought
to
pay
it
,
or
ought
to
leave
it
;
and
certainly
the
landlord
could
not
tell
him
.
<EOS>
then
he
think
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
go
back
to
his
wife
without
have
do
something
;
so
,
as
a
first
measure
,
he
pay
the
bill
.
<EOS>
the
landlord
's
eye
glitter
,
and
he
receipt
it
in
the
most
becoming
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Should
he
now
send
up
the
bottle
of
Sauterne
?
"
 
<EOS>
but
to
this
Mr.
Palliser
demur
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
to
whom
should
the
receipted
bill
be
give
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
think
that
the
landlord
have
better
keep
it
himself
for
a
while
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
there
be
some
little
difficulty
?
"
suggest
the
landlord
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
acknowledge
that
there
be
a
little
difficulty
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
must
do
something
more
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
simply
pay
the
bill
and
go
away
.
<EOS>
that
would
not
satisfy
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
must
do
something
more
;
but
how
be
he
to
do
it
?
<EOS>
so
at
last
he
let
the
landlord
into
his
confidence
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
tell
the
whole
of
Burgo
's
past
history
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
tell
that
little
episode
in
Burgo
's
life
which
refer
to
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
make
the
landlord
understand
that
he
be
willing
to
administer
money
to
Mr.
Fitzgerald
,
if
only
it
could
only
be
administer
judiciously
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
keep
him
out
of
the
gambling
salon
,
you
know
,
sir
;
that
is
,
not
if
he
have
a
franc
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
to
that
the
landlord
be
very
confident
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
at
last
arrange
,
that
the
landlord
be
to
tell
Burgo
that
his
bill
do
not
signify
at
present
,
and
that
the
use
of
the
hotel
be
to
be
at
Burgo
's
command
for
the
next
three
month
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
be
to
have
notice
to
quit
.
<EOS>
no
money
be
to
be
advanced
to
him
;
 
but
the
landlord
,
even
in
this
respect
,
have
a
discretion
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
I
get
home
,
I
will
see
what
can
be
do
with
his
relation
there
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
then
he
go
home
and
tell
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
he
will
have
no
clothe
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
say
that
the
judicious
landlord
would
manage
that
also
;
and
in
that
way
Lady
Glencora
be
appease
,
 
appease
,
till
something
final
could
be
do
for
the
young
man
,
on
Mr.
Palliser
's
return
home
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Burgo
!
<EOS>
He
must
now
be
make
to
end
his
career
as
far
as
these
page
be
concerned
.
<EOS>
He
soon
find
that
something
have
be
do
for
him
at
the
hotel
,
and
no
doubt
he
must
have
make
some
guess
near
the
truth
.
<EOS>
the
discreet
landlord
tell
him
nothing
,
 
would
tell
him
nothing
;
but
that
his
bill
do
not
signify
as
yet
.
<EOS>
Burgo
,
think
about
it
,
resolve
to
write
about
it
in
an
indignant
strain
to
Mr.
Palliser
;
but
the
letter
do
not
get
itself
write
.
<EOS>
when
in
England
,
Mr.
Palliser
see
Sir
Cosmo
Monk
,
and
with
many
apology
,
tell
him
what
he
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
regret
it
,
"
say
Sir
Cosmo
,
in
anger
.
<EOS>
"
I
regret
it
;
not
for
the
money
's
sake
,
but
I
regret
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
amount
expend
,
be
however
repay
to
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
an
arrangement
be
make
for
remit
a
weekly
sum
of
fifteen
pound
to
Burgo
,
through
a
member
of
the
diplomatic
corp
,
as
long
as
he
should
remain
at
a
certain
small
german
town
which
be
indicate
,
and
in
which
there
be
no
public
gambling
-
table
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
express
herself
satisfied
for
the
present
;
but
I
must
doubt
whether
poor
Burgo
live
long
in
comfort
on
the
allowance
make
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
here
we
must
say
farewell
to
Burgo
Fitzgerald
.
   
<EOS>
the
Travellers
Return
Home
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
do
not
remain
long
in
Baden
after
the
payment
of
Burgo
's
bill
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
shall
not
throw
any
undeserved
discredit
on
his
courage
if
I
say
that
he
be
afraid
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
what
would
he
have
say
,
 
what
would
he
have
be
able
to
say
,
if
that
young
man
have
come
to
him
demand
an
explanation
?
<EOS>
so
he
hurry
away
to
Strasbourg
the
same
day
,
much
to
his
wife
's
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
the
journey
home
from
thence
be
not
mark
by
any
incident
.
<EOS>
gradually
Mr.
Palliser
become
a
little
more
lenient
to
his
wife
and
slightly
less
oppressive
in
his
caution
.
<EOS>
if
he
still
inquire
about
the
spring
of
the
carriage
,
he
do
so
in
silence
,
and
he
cease
to
enjoin
the
necessity
of
a
day
's
rest
after
each
day
's
journey
.
<EOS>
by
the
time
that
they
reach
Dover
he
have
become
so
used
to
his
wife
's
condition
that
he
make
but
<EOS>
little
fluttering
as
she
walk
out
of
the
boat
by
that
narrow
gangway
which
be
so
contrived
as
to
make
an
arrival
there
a
serious
inconvenience
to
a
lady
,
and
a
nuisance
even
to
a
man
.
<EOS>
He
be
somewhat
staggered
when
a
big
man
,
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
insist
on
open
the
little
basket
which
his
wife
carry
,
and
be
uncomfortable
when
oblige
to
stop
her
on
the
plank
while
he
give
up
the
ticket
which
he
think
have
be
already
surrender
;
but
he
be
become
use
to
his
position
,
and
bear
himself
like
a
man
.
  
<EOS>
during
their
journey
home
Mr.
Palliser
have
by
no
mean
keep
his
seat
opposite
to
Lady
Glencora
with
constancy
.
<EOS>
He
have
soon
find
that
it
be
easy
to
talk
to
Mr.
Grey
than
to
his
wife
,
and
,
consequently
,
the
two
lady
have
be
much
together
,
as
have
also
the
two
gentleman
.
<EOS>
what
the
lady
discuss
may
be
imagine
.
<EOS>
one
be
about
to
become
a
wife
and
the
other
a
mother
,
and
that
be
to
be
their
fate
after
each
have
make
up
her
mind
that
no
such
lot
be
to
be
hers
.
<EOS>
It
may
,
however
,
be
presume
that
for
every
one
word
that
Alice
speak
Lady
Glencora
speak
ten
.
<EOS>
the
two
man
,
throughout
these
day
of
close
intimacy
,
be
intent
upon
politic
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
who
may
be
regard
as
the
fox
who
have
lose
his
tail
,
 
the
tail
being
,
in
this
instance
,
the
comfort
of
domestic
privacy
,
 
be
eager
in
recommend
his
new
friend
to
cut
off
his
tail
also
.
"
<EOS>
Your
argument
would
be
very
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
if
man
be
to
be
content
to
live
for
themselves
only
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
argument
would
be
very
well
,
"
say
the
other
,
"
if
it
be
use
to
a
man
who
feel
that
he
could
do
good
to
other
by
go
into
public
life
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
wholly
inefficacious
if
it
recommend
public
life
simply
or
chiefly
because
a
man
may
gratify
his
own
ambition
by
public
service
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
there
be
personal
gratification
,
and
of
course
there
be
good
do
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
,
 
or
should
be
,
"
say
Mr.
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
exactly
;
and
the
two
thing
must
go
together
.
<EOS>
the
chief
gratification
come
from
the
feeling
that
you
be
of
use
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
you
feel
that
you
would
not
be
of
use
?
"
  
We
need
not
follow
the
argument
any
further
.
<EOS>
We
all
know
its
nature
,
and
what
between
two
such
man
would
be
say
on
both
side
.
<EOS>
We
all
know
that
neither
of
them
would
put
the
matter
altogether
in
a
true
light
.
<EOS>
man
never
can
do
so
in
word
,
let
the
light
within
themselves
be
ever
so
clear
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
any
man
yet
ever
have
such
a
gift
of
word
as
to
make
them
a
perfect
exponent
of
all
the
wisdom
within
him
.
<EOS>
but
the
effect
be
partly
that
which
the
weak
man
of
the
two
desire
,
 
the
weak
in
the
gift
of
nature
,
though
art
have
in
some
respect
make
him
strong
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
be
shake
in
his
quiescent
philosophy
,
and
startle
Alice
,
 
startle
her
as
much
as
he
delight
her
,
 
by
a
word
or
two
<EOS>
he
say
as
he
walk
with
her
in
the
court
of
the
Louvre
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
hollow
here
,
"
he
say
,
speak
of
french
politic
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
hollow
,
"
say
Alice
,
who
have
no
love
for
the
french
mode
of
carry
on
public
affair
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
all
mode
of
govern
this
seem
to
me
to
be
the
sure
of
come
to
a
downfall
.
<EOS>
man
be
tell
that
they
be
wise
enough
to
talk
,
but
not
wise
enough
to
have
any
power
of
action
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
though
man
be
caution
that
they
be
walk
through
gunpowder
,
and
that
no
fire
could
be
allow
them
,
but
be
at
the
same
time
enjoin
to
carry
lucifer
match
in
their
pocket
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
in
the
gunpowder
,
and
I
think
there
should
be
fire
,
and
plenty
of
it
;
but
if
I
do
not
want
the
fire
I
would
not
have
the
match
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
so
odd
to
hear
you
talk
politic
,
"
say
Alice
,
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
he
drop
the
subject
for
a
while
,
as
though
he
be
ashamed
of
it
,
but
in
a
very
few
minute
he
return
to
it
manfully
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
want
me
to
go
into
Parliament
.
"
<EOS>
upon
hear
this
Alice
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
be
afraid
to
speak
.
<EOS>
after
all
that
have
pass
she
feel
that
it
would
not
become
her
to
show
much
outward
joy
on
hear
such
a
proposition
,
so
speak
by
him
,
and
yet
she
could
say
nothing
without
some
sign
of
exultation
in
her
voice
.
<EOS>
so
she
walk
on
without
speak
,
and
be
conscious
that
her
finger
tremble
on
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
say
about
it

<EOS>
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
I
say
?
<EOS>
oh
,
John
,
what
right
can
I
have
to
say
anything
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
one
else
can
have
so
much
right
,
 
put
aside
of
course
myself
,
who
must
be
responsible
for
my
own
action
.
<EOS>
He
ask
me
whether
I
could
afford
it
,
and
he
seem
to
think
that
a
small
income
suffice
for
such
work
now
than
it
do
a
few
year
since
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
I
could
afford
it
,
if
I
could
get
a
seat
that
be
not
very
expensive
at
the
first
outset
.

He
could
help
me
there

<EOS>
"
on
that
point
,
of
course
,
I
can
have
no
opinion

<EOS>
"
  
"
no
;
not
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
I
believe
we
may
take
that
for
grant
.
<EOS>
live
in
London
for
four
or
five
month
in
the
year
may
be
manage
.
<EOS>
but
as
to
the
mode
of
life
!
"
  
then
Alice
be
unable
to
hold
her
tongue
longer
,
and
speak
out
her
thought
with
more
vehemence
than
discretion
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
he
combat
them
with
some
amount
of
opposition
.
<EOS>
He
seldom
allow
out
-
spoken
enthusiasm
to
pass
by
him
without
some
amount
of
hostility
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
not
so
perverse
as
to
be
drive
from
his
new
view
by
the
fact
that
Alice
approve
them
,
and
<EOS>
she
,
as
she
draw
near
home
,
be
able
to
think
that
the
only
flaw
in
his
character
be
in
process
of
be
cure
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
reach
London
they
all
separate
.
<EOS>
It
be
Mr.
Palliser
's
purpose
to
take
his
wife
down
to
match
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
.
<EOS>
London
be
at
this
time
nearly
empty
,
and
all
the
doing
of
the
season
be
over
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
the
first
week
of
August
,
and
as
Parliament
have
not
be
sit
for
nearly
two
month
,
the
town
look
as
it
usually
look
in
September
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
be
to
stay
but
one
day
in
Park
Lane
,
and
it
have
be
understand
between
her
and
Alice
that
they
be
not
to
see
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
odd
it
be
part
in
this
way
,
when
people
have
be
together
so
long
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
It
always
seem
as
though
there
have
be
a
separate
little
life
of
its
own
which
be
now
to
be
bring
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
Mr.
Grey
,
you
and
I
,
when
we
next
meet
,
will
be
far
too
distant
to
fight
with

<EOS>
"
I
hope
that
may
never
be
the
case
,
"
say
Mr.
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
nothing
would
prevent
his
fighting
;
would
it
Alice
?
<EOS>
but
,
remember
,
there
must
be
no
fighting
when
we
do
meet
next
,

that
must
be
in
September
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
with
all
my
heart
,
"
say
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
but
Alice
say
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
then
Mr.
Palliser
make
his
little
speech
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
,
"
he
say
,
as
he
give
his
hand
to
Miss
Vavasor
,
"
give
my
compliment
to
your
father
,
and
tell
him
that
I
shall
take
the
liberty
of
ask
him
to
come
down
to
match
for
the
early
shooting
in
September
,
and
that
I
shall
expect
him
to
bring
you
with
him
.
<EOS>
You
may
tell
him
also
that
he
will
have
to
stay
to
see
you
off
,
but
that
he
will
not
be
allow
to
take
you
away
.

<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
think
that
this
be
very
pretty
as
come
from
her
husband
,
and
so
she
tell
him
on
their
way
home
.
  
<EOS>
Alice
insist
on
go
to
Queen
Anne
Street
in
a
cab
by
herself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
have
offer
a
carriage
,
and
Mr.
Grey
,
of
course
,
offer
himself
as
a
protector
;
but
she
would
have
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
.
<EOS>
if
he
have
go
with
her
he
may
by
chance
have
meet
her
father
,
and
she
be
most
anxious
that
she
should
not
be
encumber
by
her
lover
's
presence
when
she
first
receive
her
father
's
congratulation
.
<EOS>
They
have
sleep
at
Dover
,
and
have
come
up
by
a
mid
-
day
train
.
<EOS>
when
she
reach
Queen
Anne
Street
,
the
house
be
desolate
,
and
she
may
therefore
have
allow
Mr.
Grey
to
attend
her
.
<EOS>
but
she
find
a
letter
wait
for
her
which
make
her
for
the
moment
forget
both
him
and
her
father

<EOS>
Lady

be
now
quite
happy

<EOS>
It
only
want
that
to
reconcile
me
to
my

through
it
all
that
my

be
happy

<EOS>
Will
she
forgive
me
if
I
say
that
I

"
<EOS>
the
letter
then
go
on
to
beg
Alice
to
come
to
Cheltenham
at
once

<EOS>
"
It
be
not
that
I

"
say
Lady
Macleod
,
"
though
you
will
find

much
altered

<EOS>
there
be
another

her
from
Kate

full

of

"
  
<EOS>
Alice
begin
to
think
that
her
hand
be
almost
too
full
.
<EOS>
if
she
herself
be
to
be
marry
in
September
,
even
by
the
end
of
September
,
her
hand
be
very
full
indeed
.
<EOS>
yet
she
do
not
know
how
to
refuse
any
of
the
request
make
to
her
.
<EOS>
as
to
Lady
Macleod
,
her
visit
to
her
be
a
duty
which
must
of
course
be
perform
at
once
.
<EOS>
She
would
stay
but
one
day
in
London
,
and
then
go
down
to
Cheltenham
.
<EOS>
have
resolve
upon
this
she
at
once
write
to
her
aunt
to
that
effect
.
<EOS>
as
to
that
other
affair
down
in
Westmoreland
,
she
sigh
as
she
think
of
it
,
but
she
fear
that
she
must
go
there
also

<EOS>
Kate
have
suffer
too
much
on

to
allow
of
her
feel
indifferent
to
such
a
request

<EOS>
then
her
father
come
in

"
I

with
an
apology

Alice
scorn
to
remind
him
that
she
herself

the
precise

the
train
by
which
they
have

that

have
give
three
thousand
pound

now
her

"
We
could
not

<EOS>
Alice
be
unable
to
say
anything
on
this
subject
to
her

to
herself
she
do
declare

It
may
make
some
difference

may
arrange
that
.

I
shall
not

not

there
be
a
forgiveness

it
be
rather
hard
to
get

say
Alice

<EOS>
there
be
something
say
then
as
to
the
necessity
of
look
for
pardon
beyond
this
world

which
I
need
not
here
repeat
.
<EOS>
to
all
her
old
friend

little
sermon
Alice
be
infinitely
more
attentive
than
have
be
her
will
not

so
that
Lady
Macleod
be
comfort
and
take
heart
of
grace
,
and
at
last
bring
forth
from
under
her
pillow
a
letter
from
the
Countess
of
Midlothian
,
which
she
have
receive
a
day
or
two
since

which
bear
upon
Alice

case

<EOS>
"
I
be
not
quite
sure
whether
I
would
show
it
you
,
"
say
Lady
Macleod
,
"
because
you
would
not
answer
her
when
she
write
to
you

<EOS>
but
when
I
be
go
,
as
I
shall
be
soon
,
she
will
be
the
near
relative
you
have
on
your

side

great
position

you

but
here
Alice
become
impatient
for
the
letter

<EOS>
Her
aunt
hand

<EOS>
dear
LADY
MACLEOD
,
    
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
hear
of
the
symptom
you
speak
about
.
<EOS>
I
strongly
advise
you
to
depend
chiefly
on
beef
-
tea
.
<EOS>
They
should
be
very
careful
to
send
it
up
quite
free
from
grease
,
and
it
should
not
be
too
strong
of
the
meat
.
<EOS>
there
should
be
no
vegetable
in
it
.
<EOS>

Alice

weary

so
much
forgiveness

tell
herself

read
the

Poor

the

move
her
shrivel
old

up

down
upon

finish
the
letter
without
further
remark

It
merely
go
on
to
say
how
happy
the
writer
would
be
to
know
something
of
her
cousin
as
Mrs.
Grey
,
as
also
to
know
something
of

both
Mr.

observe

invitation
apply
only
to
another

<EOS>
then
you
know
you
will
probably
have
child

think
what
a

it
will
be
for

You
should

<EOS>
Alice
remain
a
week
with
her
aunt

go
from
thence
direct
to
Westmoreland

<EOS>
some
order
as
to
bridal
preparation
<EOS>
we
must
presume
she
give
on
that
single
day
which
she
pass
in
London
.
<EOS>
much
advice
she
have
receive
on
this
head
from
Lady
Glencora

no
inconsiderable
amount
of
assistance
be
to
be
render
to
her
at
match
during
the
fortnight
she
would
remain
there
before

<EOS>
something
also
,
let
us
hope
,
she
may
do
at
Cheltenham
.
<EOS>
something
<EOS>
no
doubt
she
do
do
.
<EOS>
something
also
may
probably
be
achieve
among
the
wild
in
Westmoreland
,
but
that
something
would
necessarily
be
of
a
nature
not
require
fashionable
tradespeople

<EOS>
while
at
Cheltenham
,
she
determine
that
she
would
not

return
to
London
before

<EOS>
this
resolve
be
cause
by
a
very
urgent
letter
from
Mr.
Grey

and
by
another
,
almost
equally
urgent
,
from
Lady
Glencora

<EOS>
if
the
marriage
do
not
take
place
in
September
she
would
not

the

Mr.

's
Fate

<EOS>
It
must
be
acknowledge
that
Mrs.
Greenow
be
a
woman
of
great
resource
,
and
that
she
would
be
very
prudent
for
other
,
though
I
fear
the
verdict
of
those
who
know
her
must
go
against
her
in
regard
to
prudence
in
herself
.
<EOS>
Her
marriage
with
Captain
Bellfield
be
a
rash
act
,
 
certainly
a
rash
act
,
although
she
do
take
so
much
care
in
secure
the
payment
of
her
own
income
into
her
own
hand
;
but
the
manner
in
which
she
make
him
live
discreetly
for
some
month
previous
to
his
marriage
,
the
tact
with
which
she
renew
the
friendship
which
have
exist
between
him
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
and
the
skill
she
use
in
at
last
provide
Mr.
Cheesacre
with
a
wife
,
oblige
us
all
to
admit
that
,
as
a
general
,
she
have
great
power
.
  
<EOS>
when
Alice
reach
Vavasor
Hall
she
find
Charlie
Fairstairs
establish
there
on
a
long
visit
.
<EOS>
Charlie
and
Kate
be
to
be
the
two
bridesmaid
,
and
,
as
Kate
tell
her
cousin
in
their
first
confidential
intercourse
on
the
evening
of
Alice
's
arrival
,
there
be
already
great
hope
in
the
household
that
the
master
of
Oileymead
may
be
bring
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
Charlie
have
not
a
shilling
,
and
that
Mr.
Cheesacre
have
set
his
heart
on
marry
an
heiress
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
Miss
Fairstairs
have
always
stand
low
in
the
gentleman
's
estimation
,
as
be
connect
with
people
who
be
as
much
without
rank
and
fashion
as
they
be
without
money
,
and
that
the
gentleman
love
rank
and
fashion
dearly
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
Charlie
be
no
beauty
,
and
that
Cheesacre
have
an
eye
for
feminine
charm
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
he
have
despise
Charlie
,
and
have
speak
his
contempt
openly
;
 
that
he
have
see
the
girl
on
the
sand
at
Yarmouth
every
summer
for
the
last
ten
year
,
and
about
the
street
of
Norwich
every
winter
,
and
have
learn
to
regard
her
as
a
thing
poor
and
despicable
,
because
she
be
common
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
It
be
thus
that
the
Cheesacres
judge
of
people
.
<EOS>
but
in
spite
of
all
these
difficulty
Mrs.
Greenow
have
take
up
poor
Charlie
's
case
,
and
Kate
Vavasor
express
a
strong
opinion
that
her
aunt
would
win
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
have
she
do
to
the
man
?
"
<EOS>
Alice
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
coax
him
;
simply
that

<EOS>
She
have
make
herself
so
much
his
master
that
he
do
not
know
how
to
say
no
to
her

<EOS>
sometimes
I
have
think
that
he
may
possibly
run
away
,
but
I
have
abandon
that
fear
now
.
<EOS>
She
have
little
confidence
with
him
from
day
to
day
,
which
be
so
alluring
to
him
that
he
can
not
tear
himself
off
.
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
one
of
them
he
will
find
himself
engaged
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

,
the
unfortunate
girl
!
<EOS>
will
not
it
be
a
wretched
marriage
for
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all

She
will
make
him
a

good

He
be
one
of
those
man
to
whom
any
woman
,
after
a
little
time
,
will
come
to
be
the
same

<EOS>
He
will
be
rough
with
her
once
a
month
or
so
,
and
perhaps
tell
her
that
she
bring
no
money
with
her
;
but
that
will
not
break
any
bone
,
and
Charlie
will
know
how
to
fight
her
own
battle
.
<EOS>
She
will
save
his
money
if
she
bring
none
,
and
in
a
few
year
"
time
they
will
quite
understand
each
other

<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
and
Captain
Bellfield
be
at
this

live
in
lodging
together
,
at
Penrith
,
but
come
over
and
spend
every

at
Vavasor

eight

Mrs.

as
I
be

the

always
observe
that
when

can
create

he
invariably
be

every
word
that
she
speak
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
follow
day
the
two
gentleman
come
over
,
accord
to
custom
,
and
Alice
observe
that
Miss
Fairstairs
hardly
speak
to
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
indeed
her
manner
of
avoid
that
gentleman
be
so
very
marked
,
that
it
be
impossible
not
to
observe
it
.
<EOS>
They
drink
tea
out
of
door
,
and
when
Mr.
Cheesacre
on
one
occasion
saunter
across
towards
the
end
of
the
bench
on
which
Charlie
be
sit
,
Charlie
get
up
and
walk
away
.
<EOS>
and
in
stroll
about
the
place
afterwards
,
and
in
go
up
through
the
wood
,
she
be
at
great
pain
to
attach
herself
to
some
other
person
,
so
that
there
should
be
no
such
attaching
between
her
and
the
owner
of
Oileymead
.
<EOS>
at
one
time
Mr.
Cheesacre
do
get
close
up
to
her
and
speak
some
word
,
some
very
indifferent
word
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
be
be
cut
and
he
want
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
a
scene
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
sir
,
"
say
Charlie
,
again
move
away
with
excellent
dignity
,
and
she
at
once
attach
herself
to
Alice
who
be
close
by
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
have
just
come
home
from
Switzerland
,
"
say
Charlie
.
"
<EOS>
Beautiful
Switzerland
!
<EOS>
My
heart
pant
for
Switzerland
.
<EOS>
do
tell
me
something
about
Switzerland
!
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
have
hear
that
Alice
be
the
dear
friend
of
a
lady
who
would
probably
some
day
become
a
duchess
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
naturally
hold
her
in
awe
,
and
slink
away
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
Mrs.
Greenow
cling
lovingly
to
her
future
husband
,
and
the
effect
be
that
Mr.
Cheesacre
find
himself
to
be
very
much
alone
and
unhappy
.
<EOS>
He
have
generally
enjoy
these
day
at
Vavasor
Hall
,
have
find
himself
,
or
fancy
himself
,
to
be
the
dominant
spirit
there
.
<EOS>
that
Mrs.
Greenow
be
always
in
truth
the
dominant
spirit
I
need
hardly
say
;
but
she
know
how
to
make
a
companion
happy
,
and
well
also
how
to
make
him
wretched
.
<EOS>
on
the
whole
of
this
day
poor
Cheesacre
be
very
wretched
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
I
shall
go
there
any
more
,
"
he
say
to
Bellfield
,
as
he
drive
the
gig
back
to
Penrith
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
go
there
any
more
,
Cheesy
,
"
say
Bellfield
;
"
why
,
we
be
to
have
the
dinner
out
in
the
field
on
Friday
.
<EOS>
It
be
your
own
bespeak
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
yes
;
I
will
go
on
Friday
,
but
not
after
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
stop
and
see
me
turn
off
,
old
fellow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
use
?
<EOS>
You
will
get
your
wife
,
and
that
be
enough
for
you
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
that
since
that
girl
come
down
from
London
with
her
d
 
<EOS>
---
d
air
;
"
 
the
girl
from
London
with
the
air
be
poor
Alice
,
 
"
the
place
be
quite
change
.
<EOS>
I
be
bless
if
the
whole
thing
be
not
as
dark
as
ditch
-
water
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
plain
man
,
I
be
;
and
I
do
hate
your
swell
.
<EOS>
"
against
this
view
of
the
case
Captain
Bellfield
argue
stoutly
;
but
Cheesacre
have
be
offend
,
and
throughout
the
next
day
he
be
cross
and
touchy
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
play
billiard
,
and
on
one
occasion
hint
that
he
hope
he
should
get
that
money
soon
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
it
admirably
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
that
night
to
Charlie
Fairstairs
.
<EOS>
the
widow
be
now
on
term
almost
more
confidential
with
Miss
Fairstairs
than
with
her
own
niece
,
Kate
Vavasor
.
<EOS>
She
love
a
little
bit
of
intrigue
;
and
though
Kate
could
intrigue
,
as
we
have
see
in
this
story
,
Kate
would
not
join
her
aunt
's
intrigue
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
it
admirably
.
<EOS>
I
really
do
not
think
you
have
so
much
in
you

<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
do
not
know
,

say
Charlie
,
blush
at
the
praise

and
it
be
the
only
way

my
dear

the
only
way
,
I
mean
,
for
you
with
such
a
one
as
him
.
<EOS>
and
if
he
do
come
round
,
you
will
find
him
an
excellent
husband
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
he
care
for
me
a
bit

say
Charlie
whimpering
.
  
<EOS>
"
pooh
,
nonsense
!
<EOS>
girl
never
know
whether
man
care
for
them

not

<EOS>
if
he
ask
you
to
marry
him

will
not
that
be
a
sign
that

care
for

and
if

why
,
there
will
be
no
harm
do
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
if
he

it
be
his
money

begin
Charlie
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
do
not
talk
nonsense
,
Charlie
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
or
you
will
make
me
sick
.
<EOS>
of
course
it
be
his
money
,
more
or
less
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
mean
to
tell
me
you
would
go
and
fall
in
love
with
him
if
he
be
like
Bellfield
,
and
have
not
get
a
rap
?
<EOS>
I
can
afford
that
sort
of
thing
;
you
can
not
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
say
you
be
not
to
love
him
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
you
be
to
love
him
;
and
I
have
no
doubt
you
will
,
and
make
him
a
very
good
wife
.
<EOS>
I
always
think
that
worldliness
and
sentimentality
be
like
brandy
-
and
-
water
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
either
of
them
separately
,
but
take
together
<EOS>
they
make
a
very
nice
drink
.
<EOS>
I
like
them
warm
,
with
 
---
as
the
gentleman
say
.
<EOS>
"
to
this
little
lecture
Miss
Fairstairs
listen
with
dutiful
patience
,
and
when
it
be
over
she
say
nothing
more
of
her
outraged
affection
or
of
her
disregard
for
money
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
,
my
dear
,
mind
you
look
your
good
on
Friday
.
<EOS>
I
will
get
him
away
immediately
after
dinner
,
and
when
he
be
do
with
me
you
can
contrive
to
be
in
his
way
,
you
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
be
what
Kate
call
the
blank
day
at
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
the
lady
be
all
alone
,
and
devote
themselves
,
as
be
always
the
case
on
the
blank
day
,
to
millinery
and
household
care
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
,
as
have
before
be
state
,
have
take
a
lease
of
the
place
,
and
her
trouble
extend
beyond
her
mere
bridal
wardrobe
.
<EOS>
large
trunk
of
household
linen
have
arrive
,
and
all
this
linen
be
mark
with
the
name
of
Greenow
;
Greenow
,
5.58
;
Greenow
,
7.52
;
and
a
good
deal
have
to
be
do
before
this
ancient
wealth
of
housewifery
could
probably
be
convert
to
Bellfield
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
cut
out
the
piece
,
Jeannette
,
and
work
"
em
in
again
ever
so
carefully
,
"
say
the
widow
,
after
some
painful
consideration
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
always
show
,
"
say
Jeannette
,
shake
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
but
the
other
would
show
bad
,
"
say
the
widow
;
"
and
if
you
finedraw
it
,
not
one
person
in
ten
will
notice
it
.
<EOS>
We
would
always
put
them
on
with
the
name
to
the
foot
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
quite
true
that
Cheesacre
have
bespeak
the
dinner
out
in
the
field
,
although
no
doubt
he
think
he
have
do
so
.
<EOS>
the
little
treat
,
if
treat
<EOS>
it
be
,
have
all
be
arrange
by
Mrs.
Greenow
,
who
be
ever
ready
to
create
festivity
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
much
scope
for
a
picnic
here
.
<EOS>
besides
their
own
party
,
which
,
of
course
,
include
the
Captain
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
no
guest
could
be
catch
except
the
clergyman
;
 
that
low
-
church
clergyman
,
who
be
so
anxious
about
his
income
,
and
with
whom
the
old
Squire
have
quarrel
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
have
quickly
obtain
the
advantage
of
his
alliance
,
and
he
,
who
be
soon
to
perform
on
her
behalf
the
marriage
ceremony
,
have
promise
to
grace
this
little
festival
.
<EOS>
the
affair
simply
amount
to
this
,
that
they
be
to
eat
their
dinner
uncomfortably
in
the
field
instead
of
comfortably
in
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Greenow
know
that
Charlie
's
charm
would
be
much
strengthen
by
a
dinner
out
-
of
-
door
.
<EOS>
"
nothing
,
"
she
say
to
Kate
,
"
nothing
make
a
man
come
forward
so
well
as
put
him
altogether
out
of
his
usual
tack
.
<EOS>
a
man
who
would
not
think
of
such
a
thing
in
the
drawing
-
room
would
be
sure
to
make
an
offer
if
he
spend
an
evening
with
a
young
lady
down
-
stair
in
the
kitchen
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
two
o'clock
the
gig
from
Penrith
arrive
at
the
Hall
,
and
for
the
next
hour
both
Cheesacre
and
the
Captain
be
engage
in
prepare
the
table
and
carry
out
the
viand
.
<EOS>
the
Captain
and
Charlie
Fairstairs
be
go
to
lay
the
cloth
.
<EOS>
"
let
me
do
it
,
"
say
Cheesacre
take
it
out
of
the
Captain
's
hand
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
certainly
,
"
say
the
Captain
,
give
up
his
prize
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
would
do
it
much
well
,
"
say
Charlie
,
with
a
little
toss
of
her
head
;
"
he
be
as
good
as
a
married
man
,
and
they
always
do
these
thing
best
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
day
be
fine
,
and
although
the
shade
be
not
perfect
,
and
the
midge
be
troublesome
,
the
dinner
go
off
very
nicely
.
<EOS>
It
be
beautiful
to
see
how
well
Mrs.
Greenow
remember
herself
about
the
grace
,
see
that
the
clergyman
be
there
.
<EOS>
She
be
just
in
time
,
and
would
have
be
very
angry
with
herself
,
and
have
think
herself
awkward
,
have
she
forget
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
sit
on
her
right
hand
,
and
the
clergyman
on
her
left
,
and
she
hardly
speak
a
word
to
Bellfield
.
<EOS>
Her
sweetest
smile
be
all
give
to
Cheesacre
.
<EOS>
She
be
specially
anxious
to
keep
her
neighbour
,
the
parson
,
in
good
-
humour
,
and
therefore
illuminate
him
once
in
every
five
minute
with
a
pass
ray
,
but
the
full
splendour
of
her
light
be
pour
out
upon
Cheesacre
,
as
it
never
have
before
be
pour
.
<EOS>
how
she
do
flatter
him
,
and
with
what
a
capacious
gullet
do
he
swallow
her
flattery
!
<EOS>
Oileymead
be
the
only
paradise
she
have
ever
see
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
me
;
when
I
think
of
it
sometimes
,
 
but
never
mind
.
<EOS>
"
a
moment
come
to
him
when
he
think
that
even
yet
he
may
win
the
race
,
and
send
Bellfield
away
howl
into
outer
darkness
.
<EOS>
a
moment
come
to
him
,
and
the
widow
see
the
moment
well
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
have
do
for
the
good
,
"
say
she
,
"
and
therefore
I
shall
never
regret
it
;
at
any
rate
,
it
be
do
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
do
yet
,
"
say
he
plaintively
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
do
,
and
do
,
and
do
.
<EOS>
besides
,
a
man
in
your
position
in
the
county
should
always
marry
a
wife
young
than
yourself
,
 
a
good
deal
young
.
<EOS>
"
Cheesacre
do
not
understand
the
argument
,
but
he
like
the
allusion
to
his
position
in
the
county
,
and
he
perceive
that
it
be
too
late
for
any
change
in
the
present
arrangement
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
happy
;
and
all
that
feeling
of
animosity
to
Alice
have
vanish
from
his
breast
.
<EOS>
poor
Alice
!
<EOS>
she
,
at
any
rate
,
be
innocent
.
<EOS>
with
so
much
of
her
own
to
fill
her
mind
,
she
have
be
but
little
able
to
take
her
share
in
the
Greenow
festivity
;
and
we
may
safely
say
,
that
if
Mr.
Cheesacre
's
supremacy
be
on
any
occasion
attack
,
it
be
not
attack
by
her
.
<EOS>
His
supremacy
on
this
occasion
be
paramount
,
and
during
the
dinner
,
and
after
the
dinner
,
he
be
allow
to
give
his
order
to
Bellfield
in
a
manner
that
must
have
gratify
him
much
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
another
glass
of
champagne
with
me
,
my
friend
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
;
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
drink
the
other
glass
of
champagne
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
second
nor
the
third
that
he
have
take
.
  
<EOS>
after
dinner
they
start
off
for
a
ramble
through
the
field
,
and
Mrs.
Greenow
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
be
together
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
Charlie
Fairstairs
do
not
go
with
them
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
go
into
the
house
and
wash
her
face
,
and
brush
her
hair
,
and
settle
her
muslin
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
wonder
if
she
take
off
her
frock
and
iron
it
again
.
<EOS>
Captain
Bellfield
,
I
know
,
go
with
Alice
,
and
create
some
astonishment
by
assure
her
that
he
fully
mean
to
correct
the
error
of
his
way
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
it
be
,
"
he
say
,
"
to
be
connect
with
such
a
family
as
yours
,
Miss
Vavasor
.
"
<EOS>
He
too
have
hear
about
the
future
duchess
,
and
wish
to
be
on
his
good
behaviour
.
<EOS>
Kate
fall
to
the
lot
of
the
parson
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
the
last
time
we
shall
ever
be
together
in
this
way
,
"
say
the
widow
to
her
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
,
"
say
Cheesacre
;
"
I
hope
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
on
Wednesday
I
become
Mrs.
Bellfield
,
and
I
need
hardly
say
that
I
have
many
thing
to
think
of
before
that
;
but
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
I
hope
we
be
not
to
be
stranger
hereafter
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Cheesacre
say
that
he
hope
not
.
<EOS>
Oileymead
would
always
be
open
to
Captain
and
Mrs.
Bellfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
all
know
your

I

serious
in

They
return
to
the
field
in
which
they
have
dine

find
Charlie
under

tree

with
her
muslin
look
very
fresh

what

all

Charlie
do
not

reply
that
she
prefer
be
alone

<EOS>

I
have
tell

while
I
go
indoor
and
order
the
tea

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
necessary
to
put
the
bait
very
close
before
Cheesacre
's
eye
,
or
there
would
have
be
no
hope
that
he
may
take
it
.
<EOS>
the
bait
have
be
put
so
very
close
that
we
must
feel
sure
that
he
see
the
hook
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
fish
so
silly
that
they
will
take
the
bait
although
they
know
the
hook
be
there
.
<EOS>
Cheesacre
understand
it
all
.
<EOS>
many
thing
he
could
not
see
,
but
he
could
see
that
Mrs.
Greenow
be
try
to
catch
him
as
a
husband
for
Charlie
Fairstairs
;
and
he
know
also
that
he
have
always
despise
Charlie
,
and
that
no
worldly
advantage
whatever
would
accrue
to
him
by
a
marriage
with
such
a
girl
.
<EOS>
but
there
she
be
,
and
he
do
not
quite
know
how
to
avoid
it
.
<EOS>
She
do
look
rather
nice
in
her
clear
-
starched
muslin
frock
,
and
he
feel
that
he
should
like
to
kiss
her
.
<EOS>
He
nee
not
marry
her
because
he
kiss
her
.
<EOS>
the
champagne
which
have
create
the
desire
also
give
him
the
audacity
.
<EOS>
He
give
one
glance
around
him
to
see
that
he
be
not
observe
,
and
then
he
do
kiss
Charlie
Fairstairs
under
the
tree
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
"
say
Charlie
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
"
echo
a
laugh
voice
;
and
poor
Cheesacre
,
look
round
,
see
that
Mrs.
Greenow
,
who
ought
to
have
be
inside
the
house
look
after
the
boiling
water
,
be
move
about
for
some
unknown
reason
within
sight
of
the
spot
which
he
have
choose
for
his
dalliance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
"
say
Charlie
sob
,
"
how
dare
you
do
that
?
 
<EOS>
and
where
all
the
world
could
see
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
only
Mrs.
Greenow
,
"
say
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
will
she
think
of
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
you
 
she
will
not
think
anything
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
;
 
I
think
a
great
deal
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
to
do
,
I
do
not
;
 
I
do
not
.
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
Charlie
get
up
from
her
seat
under
the
tree
and
begin
to
move
away
slowly
.
<EOS>
cheesacre
think
about
it
for
a
moment
or
two
.
<EOS>
Should
he
follow
her
or
should
he
not
?
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
have
well
not
follow
her
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
she
be
bait
with
a
very
visible
hook
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
be
a
big
fish
for
whom
these
two
woman
be
angle
.
<EOS>
but
after
all
,
perhaps
it
would
not
do
him
much
harm
to
be
catch
.
<EOS>
so
he
get
up
and
follow
her
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
suppose
she
mean
to
take
the
way
towards
the
wood
,
 
towards
the
little
path
lead
to
the
old
summer
-
house
up
in
the
tree
.
<EOS>
She
be
too
much
beside
herself
to
know
where
she
be
go
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
the
path
she
do
take
,
and
before
long
she
and
Cheesacre
be
in
the
summerhouse
together
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
,
Sam
,
do
not
!
<EOS>
somebody
really
will
be
come
.
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
there
.
<EOS>
now
I
will
not
do
it
again
.
"
<EOS>
"
Twas
thus
she
speak
when
the
last
kiss
be
give
on
this
occasion
;
 
unless
there
may
have
be
one
or
two
later
in
the
evening
,
to
which
it
be
not
necessary
more
especially
to
allude
here
.
<EOS>
but
on
the
occasion
of
that
last
kiss
in
the
summer
-
house
Miss
Fairstairs
be
perfectly
justify
by
circumstance
,
for
she
be
then
the
promise
bride
of
Mr.
Cheesacre
.
  
<EOS>
but
how
be
he
to
get
down
again
among
his
friend
?
<EOS>
that
consideration
trouble
Mr.
Cheesacre
as
he
rise
from
his
happy
seat
after
that
last
embrace
.
<EOS>
He
have
promise
Charlie
,
and
perhaps
he
would
keep
his
promise
,
but
it
may
be
as
well
not
to
make
it
all
too
public
at
once
.
<EOS>
but
Charlie
be
not
go
to
be
throw
over
;
 
not
if
she
know
it
,
as
she
say
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
return
therefore
triumphantly
among
them
all
,
 
blush
indeed
,
and
with
her
eye
turn
away
,
and
her
hand
now
remain
upon
her
lover
's
arm
;
 
but
still
so
close
to
him
that
there
could
be
no
mistake
.
"
<EOS>
goodness
,
gracious
,
Charlie
!
<EOS>
where
have
you
and
Mr.
Cheesacre
be
?
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
.
<EOS>
"
We
get
up
into
the
wood
and
lose
ourselves
,
"
say
Charlie
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
indeed
,
"
say
Mrs.
Greenow
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
too
long
to
tell
now
,
in
these
last
page
of
our
story
,
how
Cheesacre
strove
to
escape
,
and
with
what
skill
Mrs.
Greenow
keep
him
to
his
bargain
.
<EOS>
I
hope
that
Charlie
Fairstairs
be
duly
grateful
.
<EOS>
before
that
evening
be
over
,
under
the
comfortable
influence
of
a
glass
of
hot
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
 
<EOS>
the
widow
have
,
I
think
,
herself
mix
the
second
glass
for
Mr.
Cheesacre
,
before
the
influence
become
sufficiently
comfortable
,
 
he
be
force
to
own
that
he
have
make
himself
the
happy
possessor
of
Charlie
Fairstairs
"
heart
and
hand
.
"
<EOS>
and
you
be
a
lucky
man
,
"
say
the
widow
with
enthusiasm
;
"
and
I
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
do
not
let
there
be
any
delay
now
,
because
a
good
thing
can
not
be
do
too
soon
.
"
<EOS>
and
indeed
,
before
that
night
be
over
,
Mrs.
Greenow
have
the
pair
together
in
her
own
presence
,
and
then
fix
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
fellow
ought
to
be
allow
to
turn
himself
,
"
Cheesacre
say
to
her
,
plead
for
himself
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
but
no
;
Mrs.
Greenow
would
give
him
no
such
mercy
.
<EOS>
She
know
to
what
a
man
turn
himself
may
probably
lead
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
woman
who
be
quite
in
earnest
when
she
go
to
work
,
and
I
hope
that
Miss
Fairstairs
be
grateful
.
<EOS>
then
,
in
that
presence
,
be
in
truth
the
last
kiss
give
on
that
eventful
evening
.
<EOS>
"
come
,

good

natured

the
widow

and
Charlie
be
good

<EOS>
"
It
be
to
be
as
soon
as
ever
we
come
back
from
our
trip

say
Mrs.
Greenow
to
Kate
,
the
next
day
,

and
I
be
lend
her
money
to
get
all
her
thing
at
once

He
shall
come
to
the
scratch
,
though
I
go
all
the
way
to
Norfolk
by
myself
and
fetch
him
by
his
ear

He
shall
come

as
sure

Greenow

Bellfield
,
as
it
will
be
then
,
you
know

and
I
should
not
wonder
if
she
do
have
to
go
to
Norfolk
,

say
Kate
to
her
cousin
.
<EOS>
that
event
,
however
,
can
not
be
absolutely
conclude
in
these
page
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
that
,
when
I
think
of
Mrs.
Greenow
's
force
of
character
and
warmth
of
friendship
,
I
feel
that
Miss
Fairstairs

prospect
stand
on
good
ground

<EOS>
Mrs.
Greenow
's
own
marriage
be
complete
with
perfect
success

<EOS>
She
take
Captain
Bellfield
for
well
or
for
bad
,
with
a
thorough
determination
to
make
the
good
of
his
bad
,
and
to
put
him
on
his
leg
,
if
any
such
putting
may
be
possible
.
<EOS>
He
,
at
any
rate
,
have
be
in
luck
.
<EOS>
if
any
possible
stroke
of
fortune
could
do
him
good
,
he
have
find
that
stroke
.
<EOS>
He
have
find
a
wife
who
could
forgive
all
his
past
offence
,
 
and
also
,
if
necessary
,
some
future
offence
;
who
have
money
enough
for
all
his
want
,
and
kindness
enough
to
gratify
them
,
and
who
have
,
moreover
,
 
which
for
the
Captain
be
the
most
important
,
 
strength
enough
to
keep
from
him
the
power
of
ruin
them
both
.

cause
for
nervousness
.
<EOS>
Kate
Vavasor
be
to
meet
Mr.
Grey
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey

now
stay
at
Matching
and
be
to
remain
there
until
a
week
of
his
marriage
.
<EOS>
He

return
to
Cambridgeshire
for
a
day
or
two
,
and
after
that
be
to
become
a
guest
at
the
rector
's
house
at
match
the
evening
before
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
"
why
not
let
him
come
here
at
once
?
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
have
say
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
such
nonsense
,
you
know
.
"
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Palliser
would
not
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
though
a
Radical
in
public
life
,
would
not
for
world
transgress
the
social
law
of
his
ancestor
;
and
so
the
matter
be
settle
.
<EOS>
Kate
on
this
very
day
of
her
arrival
at
Matching
would
thus
see
Mr.
Grey
for
the
first
time
,
and
she
could
not
but
feel
that
she
have
be
the
mean
of
do
Mr.
Grey
much
injury
.
<EOS>
She
have
moreover
something
,
 
not
much
indeed
,
but
still
something
,
 
of
that
feeling
which
make
the
Pallisers
terrible
to
the
imagination
,
because
of
their
rank
and
wealth
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
little
afraid
of
the
Pallisers
,
but
of
Mr.
Grey
<EOS>
she
be
very
much
afraid
.
<EOS>
and
Alice
also
be
not
at
her
ease
.
<EOS>
She
would
fain
have
prevent
so
very
quick
a
marriage
<EOS>
have
she
not
feel
that
now
,
 
after
all
the
trouble
that
she
have
cause
,
 
there
be
nothing
leave
for
her
but
to
do
as
other
wish
.
<EOS>
when
a
day
have
be
name
she
have
hardly
dare
to
demur
,
and
have
allow
Lady
Glencora
to
settle
everything
as
she
have
wish
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
only
the
suddenness
of
her
marriage
which
dismay
her
.
<EOS>
Its
nature
and
attribute
be
terrible
to
her
.
<EOS>
both
Lady
Midlothian
and
the
Marchioness
of
Auld
Reekie
be
come
.
<EOS>
when
this
be
tell
to
her
by
letter
<EOS>
she
have
no
means
of

"
<EOS>
Lady
Macleod
be
right
in
nearly
all
that
she
say
,
"
Lady
Glencora
have
write
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
you
need
not
be
such
a
fool
as
to
run
away
from
your
cousin
,
simply
because
they
have
handle
to
their
name

<EOS>
You
must
take
the
thing
as
it
come

"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
moreover
,
have
settle
for
her
the
list
of
bridesmaid
.
<EOS>
Alice
have
make
a
petition
that
she
may
be
allow
to
go
through
the
ceremony
with
only
one
,
 
with
none
but
Kate
to
back
her
.
<EOS>
but
she
ought
to
have
know
that
when
she
consent
to
be
marry
at
Matching
,
 
and
indeed
she
have
have
very
little
power
of
resist
that
proposition
,
 
all
such
question
would
be
decide
for
her
.
<EOS>
two
daughter
therefore
of
Lady
Midlothian
be
to
act
,
Lady
Jane
and
Lady
Mary
,
and
the
one
daughter
of
the
Marchioness

who
be
also
a
Lady
Jane

there
be
to
be
two
Miss
Howards
down
from
London
,
 
girl
who
be
know
both
to
Alice
and
to
Lady
Glencora
,
and
who
be
in
some
distant
way
connect
with
them
both
.
<EOS>
a
great
attempt
be
make
to
induce
the
two
Miss
Pallisers
to
join
the
bevy
,
but
they
have
frankly
plead
their
age
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
woman
should
stand
up
as
a

,
"
say
the
strong
-
minded
Sophy
,
"
who
do
not
mean
to
get
married
if
she
can
.
<EOS>
now
I
do
not
mean
to
get
married
,
and
I
will
not
put
myself
among
the
young
people
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
be
therefore
oblige
to
submit
to
do
the
work
with
only
six
.
<EOS>
but
she
swear
that
they
should
be
very
smart
.
<EOS>
She
be
to
give
all
the
dress
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
be
to
give
a
brooch
and
an
armlet
to
each
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
the
only
person
in
the
world
I
want
to
pet
,
except
yourself

"
Lady
Glencora
have
say
to
her
husband
,
and
he
have
answer
by
give
her
_
carte
blanche
_
as
regard
expense
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
be
very
terrible
to
Kate
,
who
have
not
much
feminine
taste
for
finery
.
<EOS>
of
the
dress
she
have
hear
,
 
of
the
dress
which
be
wait
at
match
to
be
make
up
after
her
arrival
,
 
though
as
yet
she
know
nothing
of
the
trinket
.
<EOS>
there
be
many
girl
who
could
submit
themselves
at
a
moment
to
the
kindness
of
such
a
woman
as
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
perhaps
most
girl
would
do
so
,
for
of
all
such
woman
in
the
world
,
Lady
Glencora
be
the
least
inclined
to
patronize
or
to
be
condescend
in
her
kindness
.
<EOS>
but
Kate
Vavasor
be
one
to
whom
such
submission
would
not
come
easily
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
be
out
of
this
boat
,
"
she
say
to
Alice
in
the
train
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
that
I
may
be
shipwreck
alone
!

<EOS>
"
no

there
can
be
no

the

You

sad
for

well

I

She
talk
even
of
get
out
at

station

return

would
have
do
so
have
not
Alice

it
impossible

the
evening

Alice
together

Alice
do
not

be
very
anxious

none

indeed

Mr.

such
a
row
about

Plantagenet

nearly
mad

I
never

him
so
disgusted

I
do

so

I

so
heartily
rejoice

how
I
love

I
could
not

wish
any
well
reward

either

Alice

who
have
personally
know
more
of
Mr.

of
Mrs.

say
that
she
could
not

be
sorry
for
the

She

otherwise
I

better
suited

the
good
be

that
Mr.
Bott

do
it

regain
his
footing
with
Mr.

I
be
sure
of
that

Plantagenet
will
never
speak

him
again

,
Alice

there
be
other

what
other
news

<EOS>
"
It
be
hardly
news

I
be
very
wicked

I
feel
sure
Mr.

know
all
about

not

you
must
not

<EOS>
I
believe
Mr.
Palliser
will
certainly
be
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
before
next
month

,
if
so

he
will
never

oh
,
yes

he
will
be
in
Parliament

I
do
not

<EOS>
there
be
a
man
go
out
for
the
county
,
 
for
Barsetshire
,
 
some
man
whom
the
Duke
use
to
favour
,
and
he
want
Plantagenet
to
come
in
for
that
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
understand
what
difference
it
make
.

<EOS>

he
will
be
in
the
Cabinet

yes

who
do
you
suppose

the
new
Member

I
can

mind
,
I
do
not

He
have
never
tell
me

<EOS>
but
he
tell
me
that
he
have
be
with
the
Duke
,
and
ask
the
Duke
to
let
Jeffrey
have
the
seat
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
become
as
black
as
thunder

and
say
that
Jeffrey
have
no
fortune

<EOS>
in
short
,
he
would
not
hear
of
it

<EOS>
poor
Jeffrey
!
<EOS>
we
must
try
to
do
something
for
him
,

I
really
do
not
know
how
.
<EOS>
then
the
Duke
say
,
that
Plantagenet
should
put
in
for
Silverbridge
some
friend
who
would
support
himself
;
and
I
fancy
,
 
mind
<EOS>
it
be
only
fancy
,
 
<EOS>

I
fancy
that
Plantagenet
mention
to
his
grace
 
one
Mr.

<EOS>
"
oh
,
Glencora

They
have
be
talk
together

<EOS>
sometimes
I
think
Mr.

be
bad
than
Plantagenet

when
Mr.
Grey
begin
to
say
something
the
other
night
in
the
drawing

room
about
sugar

I
know
it
be
all
up
with
you

He
will
be
a
financial
Secretary

you
see
if
he
be
not
;
or
a
lord
of
something
,
or
an
under
-
somebody
of
state
;
and
then
some
day
he
will
go
mad

either
because
he
do

because

do
not
get
into
the
Cabinet

<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
as
she
say
all
this

know
well
that
the
news
she
be
give
would
please
her
cousin
better
than
any
other
tiding
that
could
be
tell

<EOS>
by
degree
the
guest
come

<EOS>
the
two
Miss
Howards
be
the
first
,
and
they
express
themselves
as
delighted
with
Lady
Glencora
's
taste
and
with
Mr.
Palliser
's
munificence
,
 
for
at
that
time
the
brooch
and
armlet
have
be
produce
.
<EOS>
Kate
have
say
very
little
about
these
matter

the
Miss
Howards
be
loud
in
their
thank

they
be
good
-
humoured
,
merry
girl

and
the
house
be
pleasanter
after
their
arrival
than
it
have
be
before

then
come
the
dreaded
personage
,
 
the
guest
,
 
Lady
Midlothian
!
<EOS>
on
the
subject
of
Lady
Midlothian
Kate
have
really
become
curious
.

She
have
a
real
desire
to
see
the
face
and
gait
of
the
woman

to
hear
her
voice

Lady
Midlothian
come

with
her
come
Lady
Jane
and
Lady
Mary

<EOS>
I
be
by
no
means
sure
that
Lady
Jane
and
Lady
Mary
be
not
nearly
as
old
as
the
two
Miss
Pallisers
;
but
they
be
not
probably
so
fully
resolve
as
to
the
condition
of
their
future
mode
of
living
as
be
those
two
lady
,
and
if
so

they
be
not
wrong
to
shine
as
bridesmaid

<EOS>
with
them
Alice
have
make
some
slight
acquaintance
during
the
last
spring
in
London

and
as
they
be
now
to
attend
upon
her
as
the
bride
they
be
sufficiently
gracious

<EOS>
to
Kate
,
too

they
be
civil
enough
,
and
thing
,
in
public

go
on
very
pleasantly
at
Matching

it
,
"
Lady
Glencora
have
say
,
with
jocose
mournfulness
;
"
and
why
should
you
not
let
her
jump
upon
you
a
little
?
<EOS>
It
can
not
hurt
you
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
not
like
people
to
jump
upon
me
,
"
Alice
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
why
be
you
to
have
everything
just
as
you
like
it
?
<EOS>
You
be
so
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
think
how
I
have
be
jump
on
!
<EOS>
think
what
I
have
bear
from
them
!
<EOS>
if
you
know
the
thing
she
use
to
say
to
me
,
you
would
not
be
such
a
coward
.
<EOS>
I
be
send
down
to
her
for
a
week
,
and
have
no
power
of
help
myself
.
<EOS>
and
the
Marchioness
use
to
be
send
for
to
look
at
me
,
for
she
never
talk
.
<EOS>
She
use
to
look
at
me
,
and
groan
,
and
hold
up
her
hand
till
I
hate
her
the
bad
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
think
what
they
do
to
me
,
and
yet
they
be
my
dear
friend
now
.
<EOS>
why
should
you
escape
altogether
?
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
could
not
escape
altogether
,
and
therefore
be
closet
with
Lady
Midlothian
for
the
good
part
of
an
hour
.
"
<EOS>
do
Lady
Macleod
read
to
you
what
I
write
?
<EOS>
"
the
Countess
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
 
that
is
,
she
give
me
the
letter
to
read
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
hope
you
understand
me
,
Alice
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
I
suppose
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
suppose
so
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
if
you
only
suppose
so
I
shall
not
be
content
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
appreciate
my
feeling
towards
you
thoroughly
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
know
that
I
be
most
anxious
as
to
your
future
life
,
and
that
I
be
thoroughly
satisfied
with
the
step
you
be
now
take
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Countess
pause
,
but
Alice
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
Her
tongue
be
itch
to
tell
the
old
woman
that
she
care
nothing
for
this
expression
of
satisfaction
;
but
she
be
aware
that
she
have
do
much
that
be
deserve
of
punishment
,
and
resolve
to
take
this
as
part
of
her
penance
.
<EOS>
She
be
be
jump
upon
,
and
it
be
unpleasant
;
but
,
after
all
that
have
happen
,
it
be
only
fitting
that
she
should
undergo
much
unpleasantness
.
"
<EOS>
thoroughly
satisfied
,
"
continue
the
Countess
;
"
and
now
,
I
only
wish
to
refer
,
in
the
slight
manner
possible
,
to
what
take
place
between
us
when
we
be
both
of
us
under
this
roof
last
winter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
refer
to
it
at
all
,
Lady
Midlothian
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
I
think
it
may
do
good
,
and
because
I
can
not
make
you
understand
that
I
have
thoroughly
forgive
everything
,
unless
I
tell
you
that
I
have
forgive
that
also
.
<EOS>
on
that
occasion
I
have
come
all
the
way
from
Scotland
on
purpose
to
say
a
few
word
to
you
.

<EOS>
"
I
be
so
sorry
that
you
should
have
have
the
trouble

I
do
not
regret
it

Alice

<EOS>
I
never
do
regret
do
anything
which
I
believe
to
have
be
my
duty
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
know
how
far
what
I
say
then
may
have
operate
for
good
.
"
<EOS>
Alice
think
that
she
know
very
well
,
but
she
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
confess
that
what
I
then
understand
to
be
your
obstinacy
,
 
and
<EOS>
I
must
say
also
,
if
I
tell
the
truth
,
your
indifference
to
 
to
 
to
all
prudential
consideration
whatever
,
not
to
talk
of
appearance
and
decorum
,
and
I
may
say
,
anything
like
a
high
line
of
duty
or
moral
conduct
,
 
shock
me
very
much
.
<EOS>
It
do
,
indeed
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
take
it
altogether
,
I
do
not
know
that
I
be
ever
more
shocked
in
my
life

<EOS>
the
thing
be
so
inscrutable
!
"
<EOS>
here
Lady
Midlothian
hold
up
one
hand
in
a
manner
that
be
truly
impose
;
"
so
inscrutable
!
<EOS>
but
that
be
all
over
now

<EOS>
what
be
personally
offensive
to
myself
I
could
easily
forgive
,
and
I
do
forgive
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
think
of
it
any
more

"
<EOS>
here
Lady
Midlothian
put
up
both
her
hand
gently
,
as
though
waft
the
injury
away
into
the
air
.
<EOS>
"
but
what
I
wish
specially
to
say
to
you
be
this
;
your
own
conduct
be
forgive
also
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
here
she
pause
again
,
and
Alice
winced
.
<EOS>
who
be
this
dreadful
old
Countess
;
 
what
be
the
Countess
to
her
,
that
she
should
be
thus
torment
with
the
old
woman
's
forgiveness
?
<EOS>
John
Grey
have
forgive
her
,
and
of
external
forgiveness
that
be
enough
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
forgive
herself
,
 
would
never
forgive
herself
altogether
;
and
the
pardon
of
no
old
woman
in
England
could
assist
her
in
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
have
sin
,
but
she
have
not
sin
against
Lady
Midlothian
.
<EOS>
"
let
her
jump
upon
you
,
and
have
do
with
it
,
"
Lady
Glencora
have
say
.
<EOS>
She
have
resolve
that
it
should
be
so
,
but
it
be
very
hard
to
keep
her
resolution
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
Marchioness
and
I
have
talk
it
over
,
"
continue
Lady
Midlothian
,
"
and
she
have
ask
me
to
speak
for
both
her
and
myself
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
comfort
at
any
rate
in
that
,
think
Alice
,
who
have
never
yet
see
the
Marchioness
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
resolve
that
all
those
little
mistake
should
be
as
though
they
have
never
be
commit
.
<EOS>
We
shall
both
be
most
happy
to
receive
you
and
your
husband
,
who
be
,
I
must
say
,
one
of
the
most
gentlemanlike
look
man
I
ever
see
.
<EOS>
It
seem
that
he
and
Mr.
Palliser
be
on
most
friendly
,
 
I
may
say
,
most
confidential
term
,
and
that
must
be
quite
a
pleasure
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pleasure
to
him
,
which
be
more
to
the
purpose
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
"
exactly
so
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
my
dear
,
everything
be
forgive

shall
be
forget

<EOS>
come
and
give
me
a
kiss
,
and
let
me
wish
you
joy
.
<EOS>
"
Alice
do
as
she
be
bidden
,
and
accept
the
kiss
and
the
congratulation
,
and
a
little
box
of
jewellery
which
Lady
Midlothian
produce
from
out
of
her
pocket
.
"
the
diamond
be
from
the
Marchioness
,
my
dear
,
whose
mean
,
as
you
doubtless
be
aware
,
greatly
exceed
my
own
.
<EOS>
the
garnet
be
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
hope
they
may
both
be
wear
long
and
happily
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
which
be
the
bad
,
the
lecture
,
the
kiss
,
or
the
present
.
<EOS>
the
latter
she
would
have
decline
,
have
it
be
possible
;
but
it
be
not
possible
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
agree
to
be
marry
at
Matching
she
have
not
calculate
the
amount
of
punishment
which
would
thereby
be
inflict
on
her
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
that
,
though
she
bear
it
impatiently
,
she
be
aware
that
she
have
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
although
she
fret
herself
greatly
under
the
infliction
of
Lady
Midlothian
,
she
acknowledge
to
herself
,
even
at
the
time
,
that
she
deserve
all
the
lash
she
receive
.
<EOS>
She
have
make
a
fool
of
herself
in
her
vain
attempt
to
be
great
and
grander
than
other
girl
,
and
it
be
only
fair
that
her
folly
should
be
in
some
sort
punish
before
it
be
fully
pardon
.
<EOS>
John
Grey
punish
it
after
one
fashion
;
by
decline
to
allude
to
it
,
or
to
think
of
it
,
or
to
take
any
account
of
it
.
<EOS>
and
now
Lady
Midlothian
have
punish
it
after
another
fashion
,
and
Alice
go
out
of
the
Countess
's
presence
with
sundry
inward
exclamation
of
"
mea
culpa
,
"
and
with
many
unseen
beating
of
the
breast
.
  
<EOS>
two
day
before
the
ceremony
come
the
Marchioness
and
her
august
daughter
.
<EOS>
Her
Lady
Jane
be
much
more
august
than
the
other
Lady
Jane
;
 
very
much
more
august
indeed
.
<EOS>
She
have
very
long
flaxen
hair
,
and
very
light
blue
eye
,
which
she
do
not
move
frequently
,
and
she
speak
very
little
,
 
one
may
almost
say
not
at
all
,
and
she
never
seem
to
do
anything
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
very
august
,
and
be
,
as
all
the
world
know
,
engage
to
marry
the
Duke
of
Dumfriesshire
,
who
,
though
twice
her
own
age
,
be
as
yet
childless
,
as
soon
as
he
should
have
complete
his
mourning
for
his
first
wife
.
<EOS>
Kate
tell
her
cousin
that
she
do
not
at
all
know
how
she
should
ever
stand
up
as
one
in
a
group
with
so
august
a
person
as
this
Lady
Jane
,
and
Alice
herself
feel
that
such
an
attendant
would
quite
obliterate
her
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Jane
and
her
mother
be
both
harmless
.
<EOS>
the
Marchioness
never
speak
to
Kate
and
hardly
speak
to
Alice
,
and
the
Marchioness
's
Lady
Jane
be
quite
as
silent
as
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
morning
of
this
day
,
 
the
day
on
which
these
very
august
people
come
,
 
a
telegram
arrive
at
the
Priory
call
for
Mr.
Palliser
's
immediate
presence
in
London
.
<EOS>
He
come
to
Alice
full
of
regret
,
and
behave
himself
very
nicely
.
<EOS>
Alice
now
regard
him
quite
as
a
friend
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
understand
,
"
she
say
,
"
and
I
know
that
the
business
which
take
you
up
to
London
please
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
well
;
yes
;
 
it
do
please
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
,
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mind
say
so
to
you
.
<EOS>
but
it
do
not
please
me
to
think
that
I
shall
be
away
at
your
marriage
.
<EOS>
pray
make
your
father
understand
that
it
be
absolutely
unavoidable
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
see
him
,
of
course
,
when
I
come
back
.
<EOS>
and
I
shall
see
you
too
before
very
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
why
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
because
Mr.
Grey
must
be
at
Silverbridge
for
his
election
.
 
<EOS>
but
perhaps
I
ought
not
tell
you
his
secret
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
he
take
her
into
the
breakfast
-
parlour
and
show
her
his
present
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
service
of
Sèvres
china
,
 
very
precious
and
beautiful
.
<EOS>
"
I
get
you
these
thing
because
Grey
like
china
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
do
I
like
china
,
"
say
she
,
with
her
face
brighter
than
he
have
ever
yet
see
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
would
like
them
good
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
Alice
look
up
at
him
with
her
eye
full
of
tear
tell
him
that
she
do
like
them
best
;
and
then
,
as
he
wish
her
all
happiness
,
and
as
he
be
stoop
over
her
to
kiss
her
,
Lady
Glencora
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
pardon
,
"
say
she
,
"
<EOS>
I
be
just
one
minute
too
soon
;
be
I
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
have
them
send
here
and
unpack
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
,
"
though
I
tell
her
it
be
foolish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
I
would
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
everything
shall
be
unpack
and
show
.
<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
get
somebody
to
pack
them
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
much
of
the
wedding
tribute
have
already
be
deposit
with
the
china
,
and
among
other
thing
there
be
the
jewel
that
Lady
Midlothian
have
bring
.
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
her
ladyship
's
diamond
be
not
to
be
sneeze
at
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
for
diamond
,
"
say
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
then
Lady
Glencora
take
up
the
Countess
's
trinket
,
and
shake
her
head
and
turn
up
her
nose
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
wonderfully
comic
expression
on
her
face
as
she
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
me
they
be
just
as
good
as
the
other
,

Alice

<EOS>
"
to
me
they
be
not
,
then
,
"
say
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
diamond
be
diamond
,
and
garnet
be
garnet
;
and
I
be
not
so
romantic

but
what
I
know
the
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
on
the
evening
before
the
marriage
Alice
and
Lady
Glencora
walk
for
the
last
time
through
the
Priory
ruin
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
September
,
and
the
evening
be
still
long
,
so
that
the
lady
could
get
out
upon
the
lawn
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
whether
Lady
Glencora
would
have
be
allow
to
walk
through
the
ruin
so
late
as
half
-
past
eight
in
the
evening
if
her
husband
have
be
there
may
be
doubtful
,
but
her
husband
be
away
and
she
take
this
advantage
of
his
absence
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
remember
that
night
we
be
here
?
"

Lady
Glencora

when
shall
I
forget
it

how
be
it
possible

such
a
night
should
ever
be

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

I
shall
never

oh
dear

what
wonderful
thing
have
happen
since
that
!

do
you
ever
think
of
Jeffrey

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

course
I
think
of
him

him
so
much

hope
I
shall
see
him
some
day

and
he
like
you
too

young

what
be
more

young

at
one
time

not
in

way

You
have
do
much
well

as
poor
Jeffrey

chance

promotion
do
not

so
good
now

if
I
have
a

I
wonder
whether

will
hate
me

<EOS>
"
why
should
he
hate
you
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
help
it
,
you
know
,
if
he
do
.
<EOS>
only
think
what
it
be
to
Plantagenet
.
<EOS>
have
you
see
the
difference
it
make
in
him
already
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

of
course
it
make
a
difference
;
 
the
great
difference
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
think
what
it
will
be
to
me
,
Alice
.
<EOS>
I
use
to
lie
in
bed
and
wish
myself
dead
,
and
make
up
my
mind
to
drown
myself
,
 
if
I
could
only
dare
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
think
any
more
of
that
poor
fellow
now
.
<EOS>
"
then
she
tell
Alice
what
have
be
do
for
Burgo
;
how
his
uncle
have
pay
his
bill
once
again
,
and
have
agree
to
give
him
a
small
income
.
"
<EOS>
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
"
say
Lady
Glencora
,
"
it
will
not
do
more
than
buy
him
glove
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
marriage
be
magnificent
,
greatly
to
the
dismay
of
Alice
and
to
the
discomfort
of
Mr.
Vavasor
,
who
come
down
on
the
eve
of
the
ceremony
,
 
arrive
while
his
daughter
and
Lady
Glencora
be
in
the
ruin
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
seem
to
take
it
all
very
easily
,
and
,
as
Lady
Glencora
say
,
play
his
part
exactly
as
though
he
be
in
the
habit
of
be
marry
,
at
any
rate
,
once
a
year
.
<EOS>
"
nothing
on
earth
will
ever
put
him
out
,
so
you
need
not
try
,
my
dear
,
"
she
say
,
as
Alice
stand
with
her
a
moment
alone
in
the
dressing
-
room
up
-
stair
before
her
departure
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
,

say
Alice
,

therefore
I
shall
never
try

xxxxxxxxxx
   
<EOS>
the
Story
be
finish
within
the
hall
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
and
wife
be
duly
carry
away
from
Matching
Priory
by
post
horse
,
and
do
their
honeymoon
,
we
may
be
quite
sure
,
with
much
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
when
Alice
be
first
ask
where
she
would
go
,
she
simply
suggest
that
it
should
not
be
to
Switzerland
.
<EOS>
They
do
,
in
truth
,
go
by
slow
stage
to
Italy
,
to
Venice
,
Florence
,
and
on
to
Rome
;
but
such
have
not
be
their
intention
when
they
first
start
on
their
journey
.
<EOS>
at
that
time
Mr.
Grey
believe
that
he
would
be
want
again
in
England
,
down
at
Silverbridge
in
Barsetshire
,
very
shortly
.
<EOS>
but
before
he
have
marry
a
week
he
learn
that
all
that
be
to
be
postpone
.
<EOS>
the
cup
of
fruition
have
not
yet
reach
Mr.
Palliser
's
lip
.
<EOS>
"
there
will
be
no
vacancy
either
in
the
county
or
in
the
borough
till
Parliament
meet
.
<EOS>
"
that
have
be
the
message
send
by
Mr.
Palliser
to
Mr.
Grey
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
's
message
to
Alice
have
be
rather
more
full
,
have
occupy
three
page
of
note
paper
,
the
last
of
which
have
be
cross
,
but
I
do
not
know
that
it
be
more
explicit
.
<EOS>
She
have
abuse
Lord
Brock
,
have
abuse
Mr.
Finespun
,
and
have
abuse
all
public
thing
and
institution
,
because
the
arrangement
as
now
propose
would
be
very
comfortable
to
Alice
,
but
would
not
,
as
she
be
pleased
to
think
,
be
very
comfortable
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
go
to
Rome
and
see
everything
and
enjoy
yourself
,
which
I
be
not
allow
to
do
;
and
all
this
noise
and
bother
,
and
crowd
of
electioneering
,
will
take
place
down
in
Barsetshire
just
when
I
be
in
the
middle
of
all
my
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
many
very
long
letter
come
from
Lady
Glencora
to
Rome
during
the
winter
,
 
letter
which
Alice
enjoy
thoroughly
,
but
which
she
could
not
but
regard
as
be
very
indiscreet
.
<EOS>
the
Duke
be
at
the
Castle
during
the
Christmas
week
,
and
the
description
of
the
Duke
and
of
his
solicitude
as
to
his
heir
be
very
comic
.
"
<EOS>
He
come
and
bend
over
me
on
the
sofa
in
the
most
stupendous
way
,
as
though
a
woman
to
be
the
mother
of
his
heir
must
be
a
miracle
in
nature
.
<EOS>
He
be
quite
awful
when
he
say
a
word
or
two
,
and
more
awful
in
his
silence
.
<EOS>
the
devil
prompt
me
the
other
day
,
and
I
say
I
hope
it
would
be
a
girl
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
look
come
over
his
face
which
nearly
frighten
me
.
<EOS>
if
it
should
be
,
I
believe
he
will
turn
me
out
of
the
house
;
but
how
can
I
help
it
?
<EOS>
I
wish
you
be
go
to
have
a
baby
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
then
,
if
yours
be
a
boy
and
mine
a
girl
,
we
would
make
a
change
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
very
indiscreet
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
would
write
indiscreet
letter
like
this
,
which
Alice
could
not
show
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
thousand
pity
.
  
<EOS>
but
December
and
January
wear
themselves
away
,
and
the
time
come
in
which
the
Greys
be
bind
to
return
to
England

<EOS>
the
husband
have
very
fully
discuss
with
his
wife
that
matter
of
his
parliamentary
ambition

and
find
in
her
a
very
ready
listener
.
<EOS>
have
make
up
his
mind
to
do
this
thing
,
he
be
resolve
to
do
it
thoroughly
,
and
be
become
almost
as
full
of
politic
,
almost
as
much
devote
to
sugar
,
as
Mr.
Palliser
himself
.
<EOS>
He
at
any
rate
could
not
complain
that
his
wife
would
not
interest
herself
in
his
pursuit
.
<EOS>
then
,
as
they
return
,
come
letter
from
Lady
Glencora

write
as
her
trouble
grow
nigh

<EOS>
the

at
the

quite
early

his
scheme
of
finance
.
<EOS>
the
two
man
be
seat
together
in
an
open
carriage
,
and
be
be
whirl
along
by
four
horse
.
<EOS>
They
be
both
no
doubt
happy
in
their
ambition
,
but
I
think
that
of
the
two
,
Mr.
Palliser
show
his
triumph
the
most
.
<EOS>
not
that
he
speak
even
to
his
friend
a
word
that
be
triumphant
in
its
tone
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
thus
that
he
rejoice
.
<EOS>
He
be
by
nature
too
placid
for
that
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
nervousness
in
his
contentment
which
tell
the
tale
to
any
observer
who
may
know
how
to
read
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
will
like
it
,
"
he
say
to
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
like
it
as
you
do
,
"
Grey
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
not
;
 
why
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
the
first
place
,
I
have
not
begin
it
so
young
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
any
time
before
thirty
-
five
be
young
enough
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
for
useful
work
,
yes
,
 
but
hardly
for
enjoyment
in
the
thing
.
<EOS>
and
then
I
do
not
believe
it
all
as
you
do
.
<EOS>
to
you
the
british
House
of
Commons
be
everything
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
;
 
everything
,
"
say
Mr.
Palliser
with
unwonted
enthusiasm
;
 
"
everything
,
everything
.
<EOS>
that
and
the
Constitution
be
everything
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
so
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
but
it
will
be
.
<EOS>
if
you
really
take
to
the
work
,
and
put
yourself
into
harness
,
it
will
be
so
.
<EOS>
You
will
get
to
feel
it
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
the
man
who
be
count
by
his
colleague
as
number
one
on
the
Treasury
Bench
in
the
English
House
of
Commons
,
be
the
first
of
live
man
.
<EOS>
that
be
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
I
ever
say
it
before
;
but
that
be
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
who
be
the
second
;
 
the
purse
-
bearer
to
this
great
man
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
nothing
about
the
second
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
there
be
any
second
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
we
shall
find
Lady
Glencora
and
the
boy
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
then
arrive
at
the
side
entrance
to
the
Castle
,
and
Mr.
Grey
run
up
-
stair
to
his
wife
's
room
to
receive
her
congratulation
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
be
a
Member
of
Parliament
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
tell
me
so
,
but
I
do
not
know
whether
I
actually
be
one
till
I
have
take
the
oath
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
so
happy
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
position
in
the
world
so
glorious
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
pity
<EOS>
you
be
not
Mr.
Palliser
's
wife
.
<EOS>
that
be
just
what
he
have
be
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
John
,
I
be
so
happy
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
much
more
than
I
have
deserve
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
 
that
is
,
I
sometimes
think
 
"
  
"
think
what
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
nothing
that
I
have
ever
say
have
drive
you
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
do
more
than
that
,
dear
,
to
make
you
happy
,
"
he
say
,
as
he
put
his
arm
round
her
and
kiss
her
;
"
more
than
that
,
at
least
if
it
be
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
probably
my
reader
may
agree
with
Alice
,
that
in
the
final
adjustment
of
her
affair
she
have
receive
more
than
she
have
deserve
.
<EOS>
all
her
friend
,
except
her
husband
,
think
so
.
<EOS>
but
as
they
have
all
forgive
her
,
include
even
Lady
Midlothian
herself
,
I
hope
that
they
who
have
follow
her
story
to
its
close
will
not
be
less
generous
.
