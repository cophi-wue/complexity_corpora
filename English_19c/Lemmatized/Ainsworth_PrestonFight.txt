<EOS>
the

and
the

so
charming
that

determine
to
extend
his

along
the
bank
of
the
Tyne
as
soon
as
his

but
he
have
not
quit
the
avenue
when
a
horseman
enter

,
who
be
evidently
proceed
to
the

by
a
post

boy

dress
to
indicate
rank
.
<EOS>
He

.
<EOS>
but
he
ride
well
,
though

only
with
a
sorry
hack

and
have
a
military
bearing
.
<EOS>
in
age

could
not

twenty

if

<EOS>
He

rather
above
the
middle
height

<EOS>
on
see
the

the
stranger
immediately
slacken
his

ride
slowly
towards
them

Lord

gaze
at
him
in
astonishment

"
<EOS>
He
would
never
come
here
in
this
manner
,
and
without
give
us
some
notice
of
his
design
.
<EOS>
""'Tis
<EOS>
the
prince
,
I
repeat
,
"
cry
Derwentwater
;
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
be
mistake
.
<EOS>
but
the
great
caution
must
be
observe
,
or
the
post
-
boy
's
suspicion
may
be
arouse
.
<EOS>
"next
<EOS>
moment
the

up

salute

tell

the
stranger
from
his
likeness
to

at
a
little
distance
behind
them
.
<EOS>
the
meeting
be
so
cleverly
manage
that
the
groom
see
nothing
extraordinary
in
it
,
and
the
post

boy
be
completely
dupe
.
<EOS>
"I
never

hard
task
than

"
but
I
only
land
at
Sunderland
yesterday
,
and
come
on
betime
this
morning
.
<EOS>
do
not
imagine
I
be
come
to
summon
you
to
arm
,
though
my
partisan
in
Scotland
be
ready
to
rise

<EOS>
""Pacific

<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
purpose
be
to
obtain
an
interview
with
my
sister
,
Queen
Anne
;
and
if
I
succeed
,
I
believe
no
insurrection
will
be
necessary
,
for
I
be
persuade
she
will
agree
to
appoint
me
her
successor

<EOS>
You
must
accompany
me
to
London

cousin

<EOS>
""I
will
do
whatever
your

"
reply
Lord
Derwentwater
,
greatly
astonish
by
what
he
hear
.
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
my
duty
to
tell
you
that
you
will
run
great
risk
,
while
I
very
much
fear
you
will
not
accomplish
your
object
.
<EOS>
do
you
consult
the
queen
,
your
mother
,
before
set
out
on
this
expedition?""I
do
,
cousin
,
and
must
frankly
own
that
she
endeavour
to
dissuade
me
from
the
attempt
,
for
,
as
you
be
aware
,
her
majesty
deem
Anne
an
unnatural
daughter
,
and
destitute
of
all
feeling
for
the
brother
whose
throne
she
have
usurp
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
so
.
<EOS>
yet
,
cold
as
she
be
,
Anne
can
not
be
insensible
to
the
king
,
our
father
's
,
die
message
,
which
I
propose
to
deliver
to
her
.
<EOS>
""Nothing
will
move
her
,
sire
,
depend
upon
it
,
"
say
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
Queen
Anne
be
so
strongly
opposed
to
the
roman
catholic
religion
,
that
unless
your
majesty
will
consent
to
change
your
faith
she
will
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
your
entreaty
.
<EOS>
""we
shall
see
,
"
reply
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
.
<EOS>
"
at
all
event
,
I
shall
have
an
answer
from
her
own
lip
,
and
shall
then
know
how
to
act
.
<EOS>
as
I
have
just
tell
you
,
the
queen
,
my
mother
,
strove
to
combat
my
determination
,
but
,
find
I
be
not
to
be
shake
,
she
entreat
me
to
take
you
with
me
.
<EOS>
to
this
I
readily
agree
,
as
I
know
I
could
rely
on
your
devotion
.
<EOS>
I
embark
at
Dunkerque
without
a
single
attendant
,
and
in
this
disguise
,
and
land
yesterday
at
Sunderland
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
right
glad
I
be
to
welcome
your
majesty
to
Dilston
,
"
say
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
let
me
implore
you
to
change
your
plan
,
and
instead
of
supplicate
Queen
Anne
for
the
crown
,
that
of
right
belong
to
yourself
,
snatch
it
from
her
brow
!
<EOS>
Should
you
decide
thus
—
and
I
believe
it
will
be
for
the
good
—
I
will
undertake
,
within
a
week
,
to
raise
a
large
force

by

It

already

"CHAPTER
VAnna
Webb
and
Dorothy
ForsterHow
<EOS>
well
the
two
beauty
look
in
their
gay
riding-
dress
of
scarlet
and
blue
,
trim
with
gold
and
silver
lace
,
and
plume
hat
!
<EOS>
slight
and
graceful
in
figure
,
and
nearly
of
an
age
<EOS>
,
Anna
Webb
be
a
few
month
old
than
Dorothy
,
but
she
could
not
be
more
than
nineteen
.
<EOS>
Dorothy
have
cheek
like
a
blush
-
rose
,
tender
blue
eye
,
and
flaxen
tress
,
with
feature
that
could
not
be
call
regular
,
but
be
,
nevertheless
,
excessively
pretty
;
while
Anna
's
lock
be
of
a
raven
hue
,
her
eye
large
,
black
,
and
lustrous
,
and
fringe
with
silken
lash
,
her
tint
pale
,
yet
clear
,
and
her
face
classically
faultless
in
outline
.
<EOS>
if
the
palm
of
beauty
could
not
be
assign
to
Dorothy
,
it
must
be
own
that
she
have
a
more
agreeable
expression
than
Anna
,
whose
short
curl
upper
lip
give
her
a
somewhat
disdainful
look
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
both
lovely
creature
,
and
quite
enchant
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
,
as
he
first
behold
them
stand
near
a
marble
fountain
at
the
edge
of
the
large
,
smooth
-
shave
lawn
near
the
terrace
.
<EOS>
close

them

and
a
lofty

-
dress
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
few
patch
on
her
face
,
and
a
large
fan
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Lady
Webb
have
a
haughty
manner
,
and
do
not
forget
that
she
come
of
a
noble
family
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
Webb
,
who
pay
great
deference
to
his
lady
,
be
about
sixty
,
and
have
a
mark
countenance
,
dark
eye
,
and
a
large
aquiline
nose
.
<EOS>
His
bearing
be
soldierlike
,
which
be
not
to
be
wonder
at
,
since
he
have
serve
under
James
the
Second
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
nothing
military
in
his
attire
,
which
consist
of
a
square
-
cut
,
claret
-
colour
coat
,
richly
embroider
with
lace
,
and
lace
waistcoat
with
long
flap

,
a

by
his
side
,
and
a
well

powder
periwig
on
his
head
,
surmount
by
a
small
three

cornered
hat
.
<EOS>
He
carry
a
gold
-
head
clouded
cane
in
his
hand
,
and
occasionally
produce
a
very
handsome
gold
snuff
-
box
.
<EOS>
the
Webbs
be
strict
Roman
Catholics
,
and
devote
to
the
house
of
Stuart
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
Sir
John
have
follow
the
exile
monarch
for
a
short
time
to
Saint
Germains
.
<EOS>
Tom
Forster
,
who
be
talk
to
him
,
and
point
out
the
beauty
of
the
place
with
his
riding
-
whip
,
look
exactly
like
what
he
be
—
a
country
squire
,
who
ride
hard
,
live
well
,
and
drank
hard
.
<EOS>
in
age
,
he
could
not
be
more
than
seven
-
and
-
twenty
,
and
would
have
be
consider
very
good
-
look
if
the
hue
of
his
skin
have
not
be
somewhat
too
florid
.
<EOS>
decidedly
,
he
be
like
his
sister
,
if
a
rather
coarse
man
can
be
say
to
resemble
a
delicate
girl
.
<EOS>
no
one
have
well
horse
than
Tom
Forster
—
not
even
Lord
Derwentwater
—
no
one
have
well
claret
,
and
you
may
have
plenty
of
it
—
perhaps
,
rather
too
much
.
<EOS>
Tom
Forster
keep
a
pack
of
fox
-
hound
,
and
hunt
regularly
;
and
as
he
be
hospitable
,
jovial
,
and
good
-
humoured
,
he
be
exceedingly
popular
.
<EOS>
Dorothy
constantly
ride
to
hound
,
and
be
greatly
admire
for
courage
and
skill
,
for
she
often
gain
the
brush
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
we
have
endeavour
to
show
,
there
be
nothing
masculine
about
her
—
nothing
that
could
be
object
to
in
her
liveliness
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
her
presence
operate
as
a
restraint
upon
her
brother
's
guest
,
and
keep
them
within
bound
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
Webb
and
his
family
have
be
stay
for
some
little
time
at
Bamborough
Castle
,
and
have
be
delight
with
the
ancient
structure
,
which
,
whether
from
its
situation
on
a
lofty
and
almost
perpendicular
rock
,
overlook
the
Northern
Ocean
,
or
from
its
well
-
preserve
wall
and
square
massive
keep
,
may
be
justly
consider
one
of
the
grand
castle
in
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
another
opportunity
may
occur
for
describe
it
more
fully
.
<EOS>
meantime
,
we
may
say
that
Anna
Webb
,
who
be
of
a
somewhat
romantic
turn
,
have
be
especially
delight
with
the
place
.
<EOS>
She
remain
for
hour
upon
the
rampart
gaze
upon
the
sea
,
there
stud
with
island
,
and
have
even
mount
with
Dorothy
to
the
summit
of
the
keep
,
whence
Lindisfarne
and
its
ancient
church
could
be
clearly
descry
.
<EOS>
luckily
,
no
shipwreck
occur
at
the
time
on
that
dangerous
and
rock
-
bind
coast
,
so
that
she
be
spare
any
such
dreadful
sight
,
and
no
half
-
drown
mariner
be
bring
for
shelter
to
the
castle
.
<EOS>
though
Bamborough
Castle
belong
to
Mr.
Forster
,
he
do
not
inhabit
the
ancient
structure
.
<EOS>
His
residence
,
which
be
comparatively
modern
,
be
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
but
several
of
the
old
tower
be
furnish
,
and
in
one
of
these
Anna
and
Dorothy
be
lodge
,
at
the
particular
desire
of
the
former
,
who
thus
escape
the
racket
of
a
great
house
full
of
company
,
as
well
as
the
attention
of
the
host
,
who
have
fall
in
love
with
her
,
but
whom
she
could
not
tolerate
.
<EOS>
every
day
there
be
a
large
party
at
dinner
,
and
at
these
entertainment
Anna
be
force
to
be
present
,
but
she
be
always
glad
to
get
back
to
the
quiet
old
tower
.
<EOS>
one
day
,
an
important
visitor
unexpectedly
arrive
at
the
castle
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
Dorothy
have
describe
him
to
her
,
and
paint
him
in
glow
colour
,
she
be
prepare
for
a
very
distinguished
-
looking
personage
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
far
handsome
than
she
expect
,
and
she
be
greatly
strike
by
his
manner
as
well
as
by
his
personal
appearance
.
<EOS>
to
her
surprise
and
mortification
,
however
,
he
pay
her
very
little
attention
,
and
devote
himself
exclusively
to
Dorothy
,
next
to
whom
he
be
place
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
that
evening
there
be
card
and
music
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
beg
of
Dorothy
to
sing
,
and
she
readily
comply
,
and
charm
him
with
a
lively
ditty
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
do
Tom
Forster
come
up
,
and
make
his
sister
relinquish
her
place
at
the
harpsichord
to
Anna
.
<EOS>
pique
by
Lord
Derwentwater
's
indifference
,
and
really
possess
a
splendid
voice
,
Miss
Webb
exert
herself
to
the
utmost
.
<EOS>
never
have
she
sing
or
play
more
brilliantly
than
on
this
occasion
—
never
have
she
look
more
lovely
:
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
be
electrify
,
and
suddenly
conscious
of
her
transcendent
beauty
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
he
have
scarcely
observe
her
,
but
now
she
rivet
his
regard
.
<EOS>
warmly
applaud
her
performance
,
he
pray
her
to
repeat
it
.
<EOS>
instead
of
do
so
,
she
strike
up
a
little
French
lie
,
with
which
he
be
familiar
,
but
which
he
have
never
before
hear
sing
with
such
liveliness
and
spirit
.
<EOS>
at
Lady
Webb
's
instance
,
Anna
give
some
further
proof
of
her
extraordinary
vocal
power
.
<EOS>
Her
triumph
be
complete
.
<EOS>
She
feel
sure
she
have
captivate
the
young
earl
,
who
remain
by
her
side
during
the
remainder
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
indeed
she
fully
expect
a
proposal
on
the
morrow
—
but
when
the
morrow
come
,
Lord
Derwentwater
be
go
.
<EOS>
He
have
set
off
at
an
early
hour
,
long
before
she
and
Dorothy
come
from
the
tower
.
<EOS>
why
have
he
depart
so
suddenly
?
<EOS>
no
one
could
tell
.
<EOS>
Anna
be
greatly
put
out
;
but
she
be
not
half
so
much
disappointed
as
Lady
Webb
,
who
think
her
daughter
have
secure
a
great
prize
.
<EOS>
good
-
natured
Dorothy
have
manifest
no
resentment
at
be
cut
out
by
her
friend
.
<EOS>
Tom
Forster
have
feel
rather
jealous
,
but
as
he
really
have
receive
no
encouragement
from
Miss
Webb
,
he
could
not
complain
.
<EOS>
the
Webbs
remain
ten
day
longer
at
Bamborough
Castle
,
and
during
this
time
nothing
be
hear
of
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Webb
be
determine
not
to
give
him
up
without
another
effort
.
<EOS>
so
she
tell
Tom
Forster
that
she
should
like
immensely
to
see
Dilston
,
and
he
promise
to
take
them
all
there
,
on
their
return
to
Dorsetshire
.
<EOS>
the
plan
be
carry
out
,
as
we
have
show
.
<EOS>
some

horseback
,
some
in
Sir

great

by
an
immense
quantity
of

and
though
she

about
it

she
be

perhaps
,
best
pleased
with
the
mansion
itself
.
<EOS>
It
be
large
and
more
imposing
than
she
expect
,
and
she
again
think
what
a
fine
thing
it
would
be
to
be
mistress
of
such
a
splendid
place
.
<EOS>
Lady

be
just

fondly

<EOS>
Her

""With

<EOS>
"His

<EOS>
"that

consistent
with
the
noble
and
disintereste
character
you
have
give
him

"
say
Lady
Webb

<EOS>
"
but
I
should
have
think
,
"
she
add
,
glance
towards
Dorothy
,
"
that
a
very
charming
young

may
have

<EOS>
"
I
myself
should
have

well
pleased

I
do
not

""then
<EOS>
he

<EOS>
at
this
moment
Charles
Radclyffe
make
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
see
him
return
alone
,
Lady
Webb
and
her
daughter
begin
to
have
some
misgiving
,
but
they
be
quickly
set
at
rest
by
Charles
,
and
a
few
minute
later
his

<EOS>
Lord

he
leave
him
at

go
quickly
on
alone
to
welcome
his
visitor

<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
how
Anna

His

to
the
young

<EOS>
Dorothy
be
quite
easy
in
her
manner
,
and
shake
hand
with
him
warmly
,
but
Anna
courtesie
deeply
to
the
formal
bow
he
address
to
her
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
the
flush
on
her
cheek
betray
the
state
of
her
feeling

<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
could
not
fail
to
perceive
this
,

we
doubt
not
he
be

<EOS>
Sir

except
by
the
young
lady

both
of
whom
be
strike
by
his
manner

enter
into
conversation
with
him

<EOS>
They
soon
find
out
that
he
be
a
person
of
distinction
,
and
,
learn
that
he
have
only
just
come
from
France
,
feel
sure
he
must
be
a

from
the
Chevalier

him
about

an
interest

be
agreeable

"I

CHAPTER
VIIThe

though
somewhat
formally
lay
out

as
previously
mention
,
be
very
beautiful
,
and
be
just
then
in
perfection

<EOS>
the
prince

them
very
much
,
and
of
course
everybody
else
be
enchant
.
<EOS>
after
wander
about
for
some
time
—
now
stop
to
look
at
one
object
,
now
at
another
—
the
prince
walk
on
with
Lady
Webb
,
and
the
party
begin
to
disperse
,
move
about
in
different
direction
.
<EOS>
somehow
or
other
,
Lord
Derwentwater
find
himself
alone
with
Anna
.
<EOS>
He
look
about
for
Dorothy
,
but
she
be
a
long
way
off
with
Charles
Radclyffe
,
and
no
one
be
near
them
.
<EOS>
close
to
where
they
stand
be
a
rustic
bench
,
shade
by
a
tree
,
and
say
she
feel
a
little
fatigued
<EOS>
,
Anna
sit
down
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
could
not
do
otherwise
than
take
a
place
beside
her
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
say
what
thought
agitate
her
breast
,
but
she
feel
that
the
critical
moment
have
arrive
,
and
tremble
lest
any
interruption
should
occur
before
the
word
be
utter
that
may
decide
her
fate
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
look
at
the
lovely
parterre
of
flower
before
her
—
nor
listen
to
the
plashing
of
the
fountain
—
she
hear
nothing
—
see
nothing
.
<EOS>
but
the
accent
she
long
for
be
not
breathe
,
and
Lord
Derwentwater
remain
silent
.
<EOS>
why
do
he
not
speak?feare
the
moment
may
pass
,
she
raise
her
magnificent
eye
,
which
have
be
throw
upon
the
ground
,
and
fix
them
full
upon
him
.
<EOS>
though
he
speak
not
,
he
have
be
watch
her
,
and
the
glance
he
now
encounter
pierce
his
breast
.
<EOS>
how
much
be
convey
in
that
long
,
passionate
look
!
<EOS>
how
eloquent
be
the
earl
's
reply
!
<EOS>
an
instantaneous
revelation
be
make
to
each
of
the
state
of
the
other
's
heart
.
<EOS>
no
longer
any
doubt
.
<EOS>
He
know
she
love
him
.
<EOS>
She
feel
he
be
win
.
<EOS>
yet
,
as
if
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
,
he
take
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
withdraw
it
,
and
still
gaze
tenderly
at
her
,
he
say
in
a
low
voice
,
but
which
be
distinctly
audible:"Can
<EOS>
you
love
me
,
anna?"her
glance
become
even
more
passionate
,
as
she
answered:"i
can
—
I
do
.
<EOS>
""will
<EOS>
you
be
mine
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
demand
the
earl
,
pass
his
arm
round
her
waist
,
and
draw
her
towards
him
.
<EOS>
Her
reply
must
have
be
in
the
affirmative
,
yet
it
be
almost
stifle
by
the
kiss
imprint
on
her
lip
.
<EOS>
He
have
only
just
release
her
from
this
fond
embrace
,
when
they
become
conscious
that
they
be
not
unobserved
.
<EOS>
so
engross
be
they
by
each
other
that
they
have
not
hitherto
<EOS>
notice
the
prince
and
Lady
Webb
on
the
further
side
of
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
,
in
a
moment
,
decide
on
the
course
he
ought
to
pursue
.
<EOS>
"come
with
me
<EOS>
,
"
he
say
to
Anna
.
<EOS>
and
take
her
hand
,
he
lead
her
towards
her
mother
,
whose
feeling
of
pride
and
satisfaction
may
be
easily
imagine
when
the
announcement
be
make
,
and
her
consent
ask
to
their
union
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
ask
in
a
manner
that
do
not
belong
to
the
present
age
,
and
her
consent
be
give
with
equal
formality
,
and
accompany
by
a
blessing
.
<EOS>
as
they
arise
from
their
half
-
kneel
posture
,
the
prince
embrace
the
earl
,
and
say
to
him:"Accept
my
sincere
congratulation
,
cousin
.
<EOS>
lovelier
bride
you
could
not
have

,
and
in
every
other
respect
she
be
worthy
of
you

<EOS>
and
you

fair
damsel

"
he
add
to
Anna
,
who
blush
deeply
at
the
high
compliment
pay
her
,
"
you
may
likewise
be
heartily
congratulate
on
your
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
You
have
win
a
husband
as
noble
by
nature
as
he
be
by
birth
.
<EOS>
all
happiness
attend
you!"these
gracious
observation
produce
a
strong
effect
on
the
young
pair
to
whom
they
be
address
.
<EOS>
the
prince
do
not
,
however
,
tarry
for
their
thank
,
but
hasten
away
,
say
he
desire
to
be
first
to
communicate
the
joyful
intelligence
to
Sir
John
Webb
.
<EOS>
the
rest
of
the
party
be
assemble
on
the
terrace
,
and
when
they
see
the
prince
approach
,
and
notice
the
peculiar
expression
of
his
countenance
,
some
suspicion
of
the
truth
cross
them
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
,
therefore
,
be
not
surprised
,
though
secretly
enchant
,
when
a
sign
be
give
them
to
come
forward
,
and
on
obey
it
,
he
learn
from
his
highness
's
lip
what
have
occur
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
attempt
to
disguise
his
satisfaction
,
and
his
loud
exclamation
soon
let
the
rest
of
the
party
into
the
secret
.
<EOS>
that
the
news
be
perfectly
agreeable
to
all
the
other
can
not
be
assert
.
<EOS>
the
hope
of
Tom
Forster
and
his
charming
sister
be
annihilate
.
<EOS>
but
since
the
blow
have
fall
,
it
must
be
bear
.
<EOS>
so
they
conceal
their
disappointment
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
We
be
not
quite
sure
that
Charles
Radclyffe
be
anxious
that
the
earl
should
marry
,
as
his
own
position
in
the
house
may
be
change
by
the
event
—
but
at
all
event
,
he
look
pleased
.
<EOS>
and
Father
Norman
,
who
have
an
almost
paternal
affection
for
his
noble
patron
,
be
certainly
pleased
,
for
he
believe
Lord
Derwentwater
have
take
a
wise
step
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
Webb
,
who
have
be
make
the
happy
of
man
by
the
success
of
his
wife
's
scheme
,
hurry
off
to
embrace
his
daughter
and
the
earl
,
and
give
them
his
blessing
,
and
all
the
other
follow
to
witness
the
scene
.
<EOS>
again
certain
painful
feeling
be
stir
in
the
breast
of
Forster
and
his
sister
,
but
these
be
control
,
and
all
go
off
very
well
.
<EOS>
a
proposition
be
next
make
by
the
prince
,
that
meet
with
ready
acceptance
from
all
concern
.
<EOS>
It
be
that
the
earl
and
his
choose
bride
should
be
solemnly
contract
together
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
"lord
Derwentwater
and

bring
up
together
like

"
he
say
.

GRAND

that
day
in
the
great
banqueting-
hall
of
the
castle
,
at
which
the
prince
and
all
the
guest
assist
with
the
exception
of
her
,
whom
the
noble
host
would
have
prefer
to
all
the
other
.
<EOS>
be
tell
by
Lady
Webb
that
her
daughter
be
rather
overcome
by
the
excitement
of
the
morning
,
and
deem
it
good
to
keep
her
room
,
he
submit
to
the
disappointment
with
the
good
grace
he
could
.
<EOS>
the
dinner
be
magnificent
,
though
little
time
have
be
allow
for
its
preparation
.
<EOS>
still
,
with
the
resource
at
Lord
Derwentwater
's
command
,
a
great
deal
can
be
accomplish
.
<EOS>
the
prince
sit
on
the
right
of
the
earl
,
and
on
his
lordship
's
left
be
place
Lady
Webb
.
<EOS>
next
to
her
ladyship
be
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
and
next
to
the
prince
,
on
the
right
,
be
Sir
John
Webb
.
<EOS>
then
come
the
Squire
of
Bamborough
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
record
how
the
rest
of
the
company
be
place
,
but
we
must
mention
that
the
fair
Dorothy
be
not
very
far
from
Charles
Radclyffe
,
who
sit
at
the
foot
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
undoubtedly
,
the
party
lack
its
chief
attraction
—
at
least
in
the
eye
of
Lord
Derwentwater
—
but
he
be
so
much
occupy
by
the
prince
that
he
have
not
much
time
to
think
of
the
fair
absentee
;
and
besides
,
Lady
Webb
assure
him
that
there
be
not
the
slight
cause
for
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
be
in
high
spirit
.
<EOS>
no
contretemp
of
any
kind
have
occur
since
his
arrival
at
Dilston
.
<EOS>
all
the
guest
be
devoted
to
his
cause
,
and
some
of
them
be
his
warm
partisan
.
<EOS>
of
the
attachment
of
Sir
John
Webb
and
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
he
have
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
of
Forster
's
loyalty
he
be
not
quite
so
sure
,
and
he
therefore
pay
him
particular
attention
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
a
gracious
word
for
every
one
,
and
<EOS>
not
a
single
person
present
could
complain
that
the
prince
have
overlook
him
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
his
highness
take
care
to
make
it
understand
that
he
desire
his
presence
should
be
no
restraint
to
the
company
.
<EOS>
the
dinner
therefore
pass
off
admirably
,
and
as
the
wine
be
not
stint
,
and
bumper
be
quaff
accord
to
the
good
old
custom
,
the
enthusiasm
of
the
guest
rise
to
a
very
high
pitch
,
and
could
scarcely
be
repress
.
<EOS>
but
it
soon
find
vent
when
the
cloth
be
draw
,
and
glass
be
fill
to
the
brim
.
<EOS>
the
noble
host
arise
,
and
with
him
rise
every
guest
—
save
one
—
and
the
hall
ring
with
shout
of
"
long
live
King
James
the
Third
.
<EOS>
"Lady
<EOS>
Webb
and
Dorothy
then
disappear
,
and
all
the
servant
have
leave
the
room
,
except
Newbiggin
,
whose
discretion
could
be
rely
on
,
some
serious
discussion
take
place
.
<EOS>
as
yet
the
prince
have
not
make
know
his
design
of
seek
an
interview
with
the
queen
,
his
sister
;
and
it
be
now
,
at
his
highness
's
request
,
disclose
by
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
a
deep
silence
ensue
.
<EOS>
"It
appear
that
you
do
not
approve
my
plan
,
gentleman
,
"
remark
the
prince
,
after
a
short
pause
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
liege
,
"
reply
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
answer
for
the
other
,
"
we
all
hope
and
believe
that
you
be
come
to
call
us
to
arm
,
and
we
can
not
conceal
our
disappointment
when
we
find
that
,
instead
of
make
a
determined
attempt
to
recover
the
throne
,
which
we
be
persuade
would
be
successful
,
your
majesty
be
about
to
appeal
to
the
queen
,
who
have
no
sympathy
or
affection
for
you
,
and
be
hostile
to
our
religion
.
<EOS>
rest
assure
,
the
attempt
will
be
useless
,
if
it
do
not
lead
to
other
ill
consequence
.
<EOS>
abandon
it
,
therefore
,
I
pray
you
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
there
be
every
reason
to
believe
that
an
insurrection
in
your
majesty
's
favour
would
be
attend
with
success
.
<EOS>
that
we
be
fully
prepared
for
it
,
I
will
not
assert
.
<EOS>
but
a
very
short
time
will
enable
us
to
get
ready
a
sufficient
force
to
march
towards
London
,
and
we
shall
gather
strength
as
we
go
on
.
<EOS>
none
can
be
better
acquaint
with
the
feeling
of
the
country
than
myself
and
my
friend
,
who
have
visit
the
house
of
half
the
Jacobites
and
High
Church
Tories
in
the
North
of
England
,
and
I
can
state
positively
that
a
rise
would
be
hail
by
many
influential
person
with
the
great
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
Should
your
majesty
decide
on
lead
the
army
in
person
—
as
I
trust
you
will
—
thousand
will
flock
to
your
standard

morning
she
relate
the
mysterious

them
both

they
treat
it
very
lightly
,
though
neither
could
understand
how
the
taper
have
be
extinguish
.
<EOS>
all
the
rest
they
regard
as
the
effect

an
over

<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
one
could
have
enter
the
chapel
,
"
remark
the
priest

<EOS>
"
I
lock
the
door
,
and
take
the
key
with
me
.
<EOS>
however
,
you
must
dismiss
all
these
thought
from
your
mind
,
daughter

<EOS>
to

day
the
chapel
will
present
a
very
different
appearance
from
what
it
do
last
night

""Yes
<EOS>

it
will
be
the
scene
of
your
betrothal

"I

"It

Father
Norman

<EOS>
"
His
lordship
have
arrange
the
matter

<EOS>
the
prince
will
be
present

and
it
would
be
a
great
disappointment
to
the
household
to
be
deprive
of
the
sight
.
<EOS>
""It
would
also
be
a
great
disappointment
to
Sir
John
and
myself
,
"
observe
Lady
Webb
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
besides
,
there
be
several
guest
in
the
castle
who
ought
not
to
be
exclude
.
<EOS>
for
many
reason
,
therefore
,
there
must
be
no
change
in
the
plan
.
<EOS>
""don't
say
a
word
,
mamma
,
"
say
Anna
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
quite
convinced
.
<EOS>
My
objection
be
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
the
morning
be
delightful
,
and
a
walk
in
the
garden
will
set
me
quite
right
.
<EOS>
""You
will
find
Lord
Derwentwater
,
his
majesty
,
and
almost
all
the
company
assemble
on
the
lawn

Lady
Webb

<EOS>
"
come
,
I
will
take
you
thith

perhaps
,
Father
Norman
will
accompany
us

<EOS>
""With
the
great
pleasure

"
reply
the
priest
.
<EOS>
on
Anna
's
appearance
,
Lord
Derwentwater
,
who
be
stand
with
the
company
on
the
terrace
,
come
forward
to
meet
her
;
and
as
he
approach
,
he
remark
that
she
look
very
pale
.
<EOS>
this
do
not
detract
from
her
beauty
,
but
rather
give
interest
to
her
countenance
—
at
least
,
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
He
make
some
slight
allusion
to
the
circumstance
,
but
she
laugh
it
off
.
<EOS>
not
much
pass
between
them
,
for
the
prince
presently
come
up
to
offer
her
his
greeting
,
and
by
this
time
her
cheek
be
flush
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
news
for
you
,
fair
lady
,
"
say
his
highness
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
desire
to
be
the
first
to
communicate
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
rob
you
of
your
lover
,
so
you
may
rest
quite
easy
on
that
score
.
<EOS>
My
propose
journey
to
London
will
not
be
undertake
.
<EOS>
a
messenger
have
just
arrive
at
the
castle
bring
me
a
letter
from
the
Earl
of
Mar
,
Secretary
of
State
to
Queen
Anne
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
have
engage
that
I
should
see
the
queen
,
and
lead
me
to
hope
that
great
result
would
follow
from
the
interview
.
<EOS>
these
confident
expectation
be
now
at
an
end
,
and
my
project
must
be
give
up
.
<EOS>
Lord
Mar
write
that
the
queen
,
forgetful
of
her
promise
,
refuse
to
receive
me
,
and
that
if
I
should
present
myself
at
Saint
James
's
Palace
,
he
will
not
answer
for
my
safety
.
<EOS>
under
such
circumstance
,
it
would
be
madness
to
make
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
that
I
arrange
with
the
Earl
of
Mar
to
write
to
me
here
,
as
if
I
have
not
hear
from
him
,
I
should
have
start
on

journey

<EOS>
what
may
then
have
befall
me
<EOS>
I
know
not

<EOS>
perchance
,
imprisonment
in
the
Tower

in
the
hope
of
compel

relinquish
my
pretention
to

I

<EOS>
""your
<EOS>
majesty
need
not
give
us
that
assurance

cry
Anna

but
imprisonment
would
have
be
grievous

may

dishearten

""from

how
many

nothing

<EOS>
breakfast

the

withdraw
to
prepare
for
the
ceremony

to
take
place
in
the

while
the

again
walk
forth
on
the
terrace
,
in
company
with
Lord
Derwentwater

Sir

fresh
delight
at

<EOS>
Colonel
Oxburgh

his
companion

with
Tom
Forster
,
adjourn
to
the
stable
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
good
deal
of
conjecture
among
them
as
to
the
prince
's
plan
,
which
now
seem
quite
undecided
;
but
they
come
to
the
conclusion
that
no
rise
would
take
place
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
they
all
rejoice
that
the
hazardous
—
<EOS>
and
as
they
deem
it
,
useless
—
journey
to
London
have
be
abandon

<EOS>
"something
<EOS>
ought
to
be
do
,
"
cry
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
but
it
puzzle
me
to
say
what
.
<EOS>
""have
patience

"
say
Colonel
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
"
depend
upon
it
we
shall
not

<EOS>
His
majesty
will
be
force
to
make
a
move
of
some
kind

<EOS>
"Long
<EOS>
before
the
hour
appoint
for
the
betrothal
,
the
little
chapel

<EOS>
all
the
household
crave
permission
to
witness
the
ceremony

and
none
be
refuse

<EOS>
the
guest
enter
at
the

time

and
find
place
where
they
could
.
<EOS>
but
little
room
be
leave

as
may
be
imagine

when
all
these

<EOS>
in
the
large
pew
be
the
prince
with
Charles
Radclyffe
,
Mr.
Forster
and
his
sister
—
the
latter
look
bright
and
bloom
as
usual
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
be
stand
at
the
door
of
the
little
edifice
in
momentary
expectation
of
the
arrival
of
her
to
whom
he
be
about
to
be
affiance
.
<EOS>
She
come
,
lean
on
her
father
's
arm
,
and
attend
by
her
mother
—
not
deck
in
bridal
attire
—
not
drape
in
a
bridal
veil
—
for
such
adornment
would
have
be
unsuitable
to
the
occasion
,
but
array
in
a
charming
costume
of
azure
satin
and
lace
.
<EOS>
after
salutation
have
pass
,
Sir
John
Webb
consign
his
lovely
daughter
to
the
earl
,
and
follow
them
with
Lady
Webb
.
<EOS>
an
irrepressible
murmur
of
admiration
burst
forth
as
the
youthful
pair
move
towards
the
altar
,
where
they
immediately
knelt
down
,
and
a
group
be
form
behind
them
of
which
the
prince
be
the
principal
figure
—
his
highness
have
come
with
the
other
from
the
pew
.
<EOS>
not
till
a
prayer
be
recite
could
the
spectator
obtain
a
glimpse
of
the
scene
at
the
altar
,
and
if
this
be
quickly
hide
from
their
sight
they
hear
the
vow
pronounce
that
bind
the
pair
together
,
and
they
likewise
hear
Father
Norman
's
benediction
.
<EOS>
those
near
the
altar
see
the
earl
embrace
his
affiance
bride
as
they
rise
together
,
and
some
of
them
remark
that
she
look
strangely
pale
.
<EOS>
only
for
a
minute
,
for
her
colour
quickly
return
.
<EOS>
the
prince
,
however
,
notice
the
circumstance
,
and
so
do
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
but
both
attribute
it
to
deep
emotion
.
<EOS>
nothing
whatever
mar
the
ceremony
,
the
sole
fault
of
which
,
in
the
opinion
of
the
majority
of
those
present
,
be
that
it
be
too
brief
.
<EOS>
several
of
the
household
group
themselves
on
either
side
of
the
path
lead
to
the
gate
to
offer
their
good
wish
to
the
newly
-
affiance
pair
as
they
pass
by
.
<EOS>
among
these
be
old
Nicholas
Ribbleton
,
and
an
elderly
dame
who
,
like
himself
,
have
live
in
the
family
for
year
.
<EOS>
"Eh
!
<EOS>
she
be
a
bonnie
lass
!
"
<EOS>
cry
this
old
woman
,
after
scrutinise
her
sharply
.
"
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
if
she
will
make
his
lordship
happy
.
<EOS>
He
have
better
have
choose
Dorothy
Forster
.
<EOS>
""Why
,
what
ail
her
?
"
say
Ribbleton
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
can
not
exactly
tell
—
but
there
be
a
look
about
her
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
.
<EOS>
""well
,
it

too
late
to

observe
Ribbleton
.
<EOS>
"
the
troth

plight
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
that
be
the
bad
of
it
,
"
rejoin
the
old
woman
.
"
<EOS>
but
a
time
may
come
,
when
his
lordship
will
wish
what
be
do
be
undo
.
<EOS>
"This
be
the
only
discordant
note
utter
,
and
it
reach
no
other
ear
<EOS>
but
Ribbleton
's
,
and
him
<EOS>
it
make
angry
.
<EOS>
so
he
walk
off
,
and
leave
the
old
prophetess
of
ill
to
herself

<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
and
his
affiance
bride
do
not
stray
beyond
the
garden
,
and
seem
so
perfectly
happy
in
each
other
's
society
that
no
one
go
near
them
.
<EOS>
the
prince
explore
the
mysterious
glen
,
and
Charles
Radclyffe
act
as
his
guide
,
introduce
him
to
all
the
beauty
of
the
place
,
and
relate
all
the
legend
connect
with
it
.
<EOS>
a
large
party
accompany
his
highness
,
include
Lady
Webb
and
Dorothy
Forster
—
the
latter
of
whom
have
often
see
the
place
before
,
but
be
quite
as
much
enchant
with
it
as
ever
.
<EOS>
the
visit
to
this
picturesque
dell
,
which
have
be
previously
describe
,
occupy
some
time
,
for
there
be
a
great
deal
to
be
see
.
<EOS>
but
neither
the
prince
,
nor
any
of
those
with
him
,
be
aware
,
that
while
they
be
track
the
course
of
the
Devil
's
Water
over
its
rocky
channel
,
or
stand
near
the
pool
,
they
be
watch
by
a
person
conceal
amid
the
brushwood
on
its
bank
.
<EOS>
this
person
be
an
emissary
of
Sir
William
Lorraine
of
Bywell
Park
,
high
sheriff
of
the
county
,
and
a
strong
supporter
of
the
Government

<EOS>
that
very
morning
,
Sir
William
have
receive
the
astounding
information
that
the
Pretender
have
arrive
at
Dilston
Castle
,
and
that
a
rise
in
his
favour
be
imminent
among
the
gentleman
of
the
county
;
but
as
the
news
come
from
a
suspicious
source
,
the
high
sheriff
,
though
alarm
,
do
not
entirely
credit
it
,
and
before
take
any
active
measure
—
such
as
raise
a
posse
-
comitatus
,
or
call
out
the
militia
—
he
determine
to
send
a
couple
of
spy
to
Dilston
to
ascertain
the
truth
of
the
report
.
<EOS>
one
of
these
emissary
be
now

,
as
we
have
state
,
among
the
tree
overhang
the
glen
.
<EOS>
without
betray
himself
,
he
get
sufficiently
near
the
party
to
hear
their
discourse
,
and
soon
learn
enough
to
convince
him
that
the
plainly
attire
,
but
distinguish
-
look
young
man
,
whom
he
behold
,
and
to
whom
so
much
attention
be
pay
by
Charles
Radclyffe
and
the
rest
,
be
no
other
than
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
have
clearly
ascertain
this
point
,
he
steal
away
,
mount
his
horse
,
which
he
have
leave
in
a
thicket
near
the
moor
,
and
gallop
off
to
convey
the
important
information
to
Sir
William
Lorraine
.
<EOS>
on
reach
Bywell
Park

he
find
the
high

anxiously
expect
him
,
and
call
out:"i

I

<EOS>
to

I
will

"Hedgeley

<EOS>
Jesmond
have
correctly

when
he
tell
him
that
a

a
vast
deal
of
handsome
plate
be
display
at
the
banquet
,
which
be
far
more
agreeable

<EOS>
but
nearly
double

be
greatly
strike
by
the
impose

<EOS>
It

and
all
be
aware
that
a

—
but
no
importance

who
bow
reverently
as
he

,
and
everything
look
so
cheerful
and
comfortable
,
and
so
like
the
abode
of
a
country
squire
—
all
the
door
be
wide
open
—
there
be
so
many
dog
about
—
and
such
an
air
of
free
and
easy
hospitality
pervade
the
place
—
that
he
would
fain
have
take
up
his
quarter
there
,
have
it
be
judge
prudent
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
Forster
would
have
readily
accede
to
his
highness
's
wish
,
and
have
assign
him
the
good
room
in
the
mansion
,
but
Lord
Widdrington
and
Colonel
Oxburgh
declare
that
he
must
be
lodge
in
the
old
castle
.
<EOS>
there
he
may
sleep
in
security
—
surround
by
lofty
wall
,
and
protect
by

gate
.
<EOS>
in

Quite

,
the
chamber
within
which
be
comfortably

,
and
with
this
accommodation
he
be
very
well
content
.
<EOS>
as
a
guard
to
his
highness
,
it
be
next
arrange
that
Colonel
Oxburgh
should
occupy
the
low
chamber
of
the
same
tower
,
and
that
the
adjoining
fortification
should
be
tenant
by
Captain
Wogan
and
the
rest
of
the
troop
,
together
with
some
of
Mr.
Forster
's
retainer
on
whose
courage
and
fidelity
perfect
reliance
could
be
place

<EOS>
these

the
strength
of
its

the

tolerably
calm
,
the

the
precipitous
rock
on
which
the
edifice
be
rear

<EOS>
the
Farne
Islands
look
close

,
and
Holy

could
be

<EOS>
turn
from

,
the

here
they

by
the
butler

welcome
intelligence

<EOS>
though
it
be
judge
expedient
that
the
prince
should
lodge
within
the
castle
,
it
be
not
think
necessary
that
he
should
dine
there
.
<EOS>
"if

your
pleasure

highness
do
not
deem
that
necessary

in
quest
of
them

as
night

he
do

in

the

the

Lord

Lord

astonishment

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
come
that
to
pass?""you
shall
hear
,
"
she
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
leave
by
myself
for
a
short
time
near
the
castle
—
Lord
Derwentwater
have
ride
off
to
bring
me
another
horse
,
my
own
having
get
injure
by
a
fall
—
when
I
think
I
would
take
a
peep
at
the
ruin
which
be
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
foolishly
act
upon
the
impulse
,
I
fly
thither
—
mean
to
get
back
in
a
few
minute
—
and
never
stop
till
I
get
into
the
court
.
<EOS>
after
gaze
at
Queen
Margaret
's
Tower
and
Lilburne
's
Tower
,
I
look
round
the
wall
,
when
my
eye
fall
upon
a
cavity
at
a
little
distance
from
me
.
<EOS>
within
the
hollow
be
a
flight
of
step
,
lead
,
as
I
fancy
,
to
some
vault
or
dungeon
,
and
prompt
by
curiosity
,
I
hastily
descend
them
.
<EOS>
the
step
bring
me
to
an
arched
passage
,
and
still
under
the
influence
of
curiosity
I
venture
on
,
and
soon
find
that
other
passage
branch
off
on
the
right
and
leave
.
<EOS>
into
one
of
these
I
turn
and
advance
a
few
yard
,
and
inadvertently
step
forward
—
for
I
could
now
see
nothing
—
slip
down
a
rapid
descent
,
that
land
me
in
what
I
know
to
be
a
spacious
cavern
.
<EOS>
at
first
,
I
be
not
so
much
alarm
,
because
I
fancy
I
could
extricate
myself
from
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
remount
the
place
down
which
I
have
fall
,
and
be
now
greatly
frightened
,
I
endeavour
to
find
another
exit
.
<EOS>
but
the
attempt
be
fruitless
.
<EOS>
My
outstretched
hand
only
encounter
a
wall
of
rock
,
and
I
soon
become
so
perplexed
and
confuse
that
I
could
not
even
find
my
way
back
to
the
spot
I
have
just
quit
.
<EOS>
""a
terrible
position
to
be
place
in
!
"
exclaim
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
you
have
recover
so
soon
from
the
effect
of
the
fright
.
<EOS>
""I
think
I
should
have
sink
at
the
time

she
rejoin
.
"
<EOS>
but
fortunately
my
spirit
support
me
.
<EOS>
I
address
a
prayer
to
Saint
Anna
,
and
then
feel
easy
.
<EOS>
but
deliverance
do
not
come
so
soon
as
I
expect
,
and
there
be
an
interval
of
dreadful
suspense

<EOS>
You

long

she
add
to
Lord
Derwentwater

"
<EOS>

<EOS>
when
I

your
voice

I
know
I
be

<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
your
response

me
new
life

"
he
say
;
"
for
hope
be
almost
extinct
within
my

that
cavern

the
last

search

for

I
have
notice
the
stone
step

""I

""The

agreeable
one

say
Anna

it
have
test
his

affection

<EOS>
however

I
promise
to
be
more
careful
in

<EOS>
""yes

pretty
good
lesson

will
do
well

herself

from

rush
up

We

scarcely

circumstance
another

the
grand

drunk
at
Mr.

we
have
already

probably
not

be
amazed
by
the
multitude
of
sea

bird
that
cover
their
rock

precipice
,
and
occasionally
rise
in
cloud
,
utter
shriek

the

examine
the

bay
almost
shut
in

form
an
entrance
to
the

Island

he
observe
a
boat
come
forth
.
<EOS>
It
be
large
and
roomy
,
strongly
build
and
well
calculated
for
a
rough
sea
,
and
seem
to
contain
a
dozen
man
arm
with
musket
or
fowling
-
piece
.
<EOS>
the
appearance
of
this
boat
and
its
crew
excite
some
misgive
on
the
part
of
those
who
watch
it
,
especially
when
they
find
it
be
steer
direct
for
the

<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
be
prepare
to
descend
to
the
court

give
the
alarm
,
when
the
boat
,
which

now
get
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
shore

suddenly
change
its
course

turn
off
on

Its
movement
be
anxiously
watch

the
apprehension

it
go
on

and
after
round
Beadnell
Point
be
lose

the

breathe
more
freely

<EOS>
"I
think
those
man
be
about

he

it

""I

Lord

They
be
evidently
reconnoitre
the
place
,
but
something
cause
them
to
change
their
plan
,
and
steer
off
.
<EOS>
yet
a
rumour
that
your

here
can
scarcely
have
reach
yonder
remote

be
constantly

as
the

it
be
highly
probable
the
islander
have
hear
the
news
.
<EOS>
but
I
should
have
think
they
be
more
likely
to
aid
his

to
attack
him

<EOS>
""they

stimulate
by
the

be
that
as
it

I
be
glad
they
have
give
up
the

""We
may
have
another

it

Derwentwater

<EOS>
Sir
John

Lady

would
probably
pass
the
night
at
Morpeth
,
and
in
that
case
they
could
not
be
here
till
late
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"just
<EOS>
then
a
noise
be

at
the

roof

Lord

his
appearance

Mr.
Forster

Colonel
Oxburgh

<EOS>
everybody
seem
surprised
to
see
his

no

<EOS>
"What
!
<EOS>
so
soon

<EOS>
have
you

Lord

<EOS>
"
I
have
hire
a
sloop
now
in
Berwick
harbour

which
be
to

this
evening
for
London

<EOS>
but
I
have
induce
Captain

as
the
sloop
be

to
alter
his

<EOS>
in

he

<EOS>
""You

have
render
me
a
great

the

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
where
be
I
to

on
board
the
sloop?—at
Berwick?""No
,
my
liege

reply
Lord
Widdrington

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
since
there
be
almost
a
certainty
of
fine
weather
,
Captain
Hawker
will
weigh
anchor
at
nine
o'clock

and
fire
a
gun
to
let
you
know
when
he
get
off

"The

signify
his
approval

you

embark
immediately

Forster

<EOS>
again
the
prince
express
his
satisfaction
,
but
he
ask
Mr.
Forster
if
he
have
notice
the
boat
contain
the
armed
man
,
that
have
cross
the
Fairway
,
apparently
to
reconnoitre
the

<EOS>
"those

reply
the
squire

<EOS>
"
I
feel
sure
they
would
move
off

so
they

It

VIIIHow
the
Sheriff

in
the
morning

Captain
Wogan
with
his

Mr.

set
forth
on

to
patrol
the

themselves
at
various
point

<EOS>
They
do
not
return
till
late
in
the
afternoon

and
then
they
bring
no
alarm
intelligence
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
sign
whatever
of
the
approach
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
They
have
see
Sir
John
Webb
's
carriage
in
the
distance
,
but
it
come
on
so
slowly
that
they
have
not
wait
for
it

<EOS>
half
an
hour
afterwards
the

arrive

and
then
the

learn
what
have
happen
,
and
be
greatly
amuse
by
Sir
John
's
description
of
the
arrest
make
by

<EOS>
It
appear

to
Newcastle

where
the
mistake
be
quickly
discover

the
man
set
at

<EOS>
Sir

likewise
allow
to
proceed
on

<EOS>
"The

very
much
mortify
by
the
great
blunder

have
make

"
remark
Sir
John
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
not
think
he
will
give
up
the
pursuit

and
I
fear
your
majesty
may
expect
a
visit
from
him
at
Bamborough

<EOS>
""i

I
sincerely
trust
nothing

all
the

Dorothy

good
to
cheer
him

<EOS>
the
repast
be
about
half
over

when
a
servant
hastily
enter
the
room

and
inform
his
master
that
the
sheriff

a
large
posse

the
plan
previously
arrange

through
a
window

be
instantly
remove

and
the
vacancy
fill
up
.
<EOS>
all
this
be
the
work
of
a
few
moment
.
<EOS>
shortly
afterwards
,
the
sheriff
be
usher
into
the
room
,
and
seem
greatly
surprised
by
the
sight
of
so
large
a
party
,
for
which
he
be
evidently
unprepared

<EOS>
while
he
be
hesitate
what
to
do

Mr.

arise

and
greet
him
in
a
friendly

"We

at

from
Forster

next
his

Jesmond

at
the

time
as
his

wonder
what
would
happen
next

not
venture
to
interfere

<EOS>
"what
<EOS>
will
you
take
,
Sir

—
some
venison
?
<EOS>
there
be
a
fine
haunch
at
the
other
end

<EOS>
""You

to
take

Jesmond

<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
I
will
presently

reply
the

in

I
will
begin
with
the
venison

<EOS>
be
the
Pretender
here?""I

Sir

reply
the
official

look
round
inquisitively
at
the
guest

<EOS>
"
but
I
can
not
quite
distinguish
the
feature

person
at
the
bottom

<EOS>
stay
!
<EOS>
there
be
some
one
rather
like
him
next
to
Sir

Webb

<EOS>
""Be
<EOS>
quite
sure
you
be
right

say
the
sheriff

It
will
not
do
to
make
a
second
mistake
.
<EOS>
"meantime
<EOS>
,
the
venison
be
bring
,
and
prove
so
good
that
the
sheriff
make
no
objection
to
a
few
more
slice
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
he
very
readily
accept
Mr.
Forster
's
challenge
to
a
glass
of
claret
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
in
a
much
well
humour

partook
of
several
other
dish
,
and
repeatedly
empty
the
goblet
which
be
constantly
replenish
by
the
butler
.
<EOS>
the
generous
wine
do
its
duty
,
and
he
almost
forget
his
errand
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
one
now
to
remind
him
of
it
,
for
Jesmond
have
be
lure
to
the
sideboard
by
the
butler
,
and
a
flask
of
claret
proffer
him
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
decline
the
attention
.
<EOS>
since
his
chief
be
enjoy
himself
,
he
do
not
see
why
he
should
not
follow
his
example
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
merely
Mr.
Forster
who
be
attentive
in
the
extreme
to
his
unwelcome
guest

<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater

Lord
Widdrington
,
with
both
of
whom
<EOS>
Sir
William
Lorraine
be
well
acquaint
,
though
political
and
religious
difference
keep
them
apart
—
these
two
proud
noble
,
we
say
,
quite
unbent
,
and
be
excessively
complaisant
,
invite
him
to
take
wine
,
and
converse
very
familiarly
with
him
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
Webb
pursue
the
same
course
,
and
as
he
drink
a
glass
of
wine
with
the
sheriff
,
he
give
him
a
knowing
look
,
just
to
remind
him
of
the
recent
adventure
.
<EOS>
Sir
William
laugh
very
good
-
humouredly
.
<EOS>
thus
the
dinner
go
on
,
and
the
sheriff
become
yet
more
cheerful
,
as
be
naturally
to
be
expect
,
for
he
have
now
drink
a
good
deal
of
claret
.
<EOS>
with
the
removal
of
the
cloth
,
the
lady
disappear
,
for
they
know
what
be
likely
to
occur
,
and
then
an
immense
bowl
of
punch
be
place
before
the
host
for
the
delectation
of
such
as
prefer
that
pleasant
beverage
to
claret
.
<EOS>
unfortunately
for
himself
,
Sir
William
yield
to
the
seduction

<EOS>
at
that
precise
juncture
he
mean
to
have
assume
an
authoritative
air
,
preparatory
to
carry
out
the
business
that
bring
him
thither
;
but
a
bumper
of
punch
cause
him
to
postpone
it
to
a
later
moment
.
<EOS>
Jesmond
be
no
longer
there
to
watch
over
him
,
and
incite
him
by
his
observation
.
<EOS>
that
vigilant
official
have
be
take
to
the
butler
's
pantry
,
where
he
,
too
,
have
his
share
—
somewhat
more
than
his
share
of
a
strong
bowl
of
punch
.
<EOS>
Punch
be
his
weakness
,
as
well
as
that
of
the
sheriff
,
and
he
find
the
temptation
irresistible
.
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
suppose
that
while
their
leader
be
thus
care
for
,
the
yeoman
be
neglect

<EOS>
on
the
contrary
they

very
well
attend
to
.
<EOS>
They
be
tell
that
the
sheriff
have
order
them
to
dismount
,
and
they
very
readily
obey
.
<EOS>
Their
horse
be
accommodate
in
the
squire
's
roomy
stable
,
and
they
themselves
be
conduct
to
the
spacious
servant

hall
,
where
all
that

and
it

no

—
of
the
abundant
dinner

set
before
them

together
with
as
much
strong
ale
as
they
choose
to
drink
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
serve
with
punch
,
like
their
better
,
but
they
be
offer
usquebaugh
,
and
we
may
be
sure
they
do
not
refuse
the
stimulate
liquor
,
which
nearly
resemble

pretty
freely

They

He

<EOS>
in
two
hour

time
—
if
they

on
as
they
be
now
do
—
the
sheriff
and
his
party
will
be
quite
incapable
of
offer
any
opposition
to
your
majesty
's
departure
.
<EOS>
as
to
their
attack
the
castle
,
that
be
quite
out
of

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
good

to
well
account
than
on
the
present
occasion

<EOS>
I
own
I
doubt
the
success
of
the
scheme
,
but
I
do
not
know
the
habit
of
my
northumbrian
liege
so
well
as
Mr.
Forster
.
<EOS>
the
sheriff

<EOS>
""He

"after
<EOS>
a
little
further
discourse

they
come
forth
into
the
court
,
where
they
continue
till
such
time
as
it

to
grow
dark
,
when
they
mount
the
outer
wall
,
and
gaze
at
the
dusky
,
yet
glimmer
expanse
spread
out
before
them
.
<EOS>
the
tide
be
come
in
,
and
they
could
distinguish
the
white
line
form
by
the
wave
,
and
hear
their
sound
as
they
break
upon
the
shore
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
already

the
beacon

light
on
Prior
Castell

<EOS>
as
far
as
could
be
make
out
,
there

no

<EOS>
the
boat
destine
for
the

lie
upon
the
beach

could
be
easily
push
into
the
sea

and
two
man
be
stand
near

<EOS>
have
make
these
observation
,
the
prince
and
the
lady
with
him
return
to
the
basement
court
where
they
find
Lord

<EOS>
the
tiding
bring
by
the
two
noble
be
highly
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
no

now
of
any
interruption
from

<EOS>
He
be

a
second
bowl
of
punch
with
Mr.
Forster
,
and
when
that

<EOS>
His

Lord
Derwentwater

that
he
be
right
glad
to

from
it

<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
,
and
since
no
interference
could
be
expect
,
the
prince
determine
to
repair
at
once
to
the
beach
,
and
there
await

<EOS>
all

he
have

for

but
the

be
equally
desirous
to
attend
him
,
and
he
could
not

their

but
the
window
of
the
mansion

and
the

<EOS>
It

now
nearly
high

and
only
a
strip

It
have
be
arrange
that

should
accompany
the

to
the

<EOS>
accordingly
they
enter
the
boat
with
him

<EOS>
as
the
bark
quit

the

stand
up
to

row
by
two
strong
man

the
boat
make
good
way
towards
the
sloop

and
it
seem
would
soon
reach
her
,
when
an
unlooked
for
interruption
occur
.
<EOS>
a
dark
object
be
see
lie
directly
in
their
course
,
and
as
there
could
be
no
doubt
it
be
a
boat
,
much
large
than
their
own
,
they
turn
aside
to
avoid
it
.
<EOS>
as
they
do
so
,
the
large
boat
be
put
in
motion
,
with
the
evident
design
of
give
chase
,
while
a
loud
authoritative
voice
call
out
to
the
occupant
of
the
small
bark
to
stop
.
<EOS>
as
may
be
imagine
,
the
order
be
entirely
disregard
,
while
Lord
Widdrington
urge
the
oarsman
to
pull
their
hard
for
the
ship
,
and
they
make
such
exertion
that
they
appear
to
gain
upon
their
pursuer

<EOS>
of
the
purpose
of
the
latter
no
doubt
could
now
be
entertain
.
<EOS>
It
be
certain
they
be
endeavour
to
intercept
the
prince
's
flight
,
and
effect
his
capture
.
<EOS>
how
they
have
obtain
information
could
only
be
surmise
,
but
they
have
lay
their
plan
well
.
<EOS>
the
prince
's
companion
be
greatly
alarm
,
but
he
himself
maintain
perfect
composure
.
<EOS>
"'tis
<EOS>
the
boat
I
beheld
this
morning
from
the
castle
wall
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
sure
it
mean
mischief
,
though
Mr.
Forster
think
otherwise
.
<EOS>
the
man
within
it
be
armed
.
<EOS>
""Luckily
,
we
have
arm

"
say
Lord
Derwentwater
,
give
Lord
Widdrington
one
of
the
musket

keep
the
other
himself

<EOS>
"
Shall
we
use
them?""certainly
,
"
reply
the
prince

<EOS>
"
I
will
never
surrender
to
those
man
.
<EOS>
"a
conflict
,
indeed
,
appear
inevitable
,
if
they
be
overtaken
,
for
a
voice
call
out
from
the
large
boat:"stop
!
<EOS>
or
we
will
fire
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
no
notice
be
take
of
the
threat
,
except
that
the
rower
redouble
their
effort

a
shot
be
fire
,
and
a
bullet
whistle
past
the
prince

head
,
but
without
do
any
injury

<EOS>
exasperate
by
the
audacious
act
the
two
noble
discharge
their
musket
,
and
with
good
effect
,
as
be
show
by
the
outcry
that
follow
.
<EOS>
evidently
a
couple
of
man
be
wound
,
and
great
confusion
be
cause
among
the
rest
.
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
they
lose
way
,
and
the
distance
between
the
boat
be
perceptibly
increase
.
<EOS>
however
,
they
soon
recover
,
and
continue
the
chase
with
fresh
ardour

again
shout
to
the
fugitive
to
stop
.

"stand

off

"
what

you

by
molest
us
thus?""we
<EOS>
want
the
Pretender
,

will
have
him

"
rejoin
the
voice
that
have
first
speak
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
best
deliver
him
up
quietly
.
<EOS>
He
shall
not
escape
.
<EOS>
"though
<EOS>
very
well
inclined
to
answer
this
insolent
speech
by
a
shot
,
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
forbore
,
but
the
pursuer
again
fire
,
and
this
time
one
of
the
rower
be
hit
in
the
arm
,
so
that
he
could
not
pull
at
the
oar
,
whereupon
Lord
Widdrington
take
his
place
.
<EOS>
but
the
change
,
though
quickly
effect
,
cause
some
little
delay
,
and
the
pursuer
gain
upon
them
.
<EOS>
an
encounter
now
seem
imminent
,
and
since
the
prince
be
determine
not
to
yield
,
it
may
be
fraught
with
most
serious
consequence
.
<EOS>
to
avert
these
if
possible
,
Lord
Derwentwater
shout
lustily
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
captain
of
the
sloop
which
be
now
not
more
than
a
furlong
off

<EOS>
Captain
Hawker
be
already
on
the
alert

and
prepare
to
render
assistance
.
<EOS>
the
firing
have
show
him
the
relative
position
of
the
boat
,
and
comprehend
exactly
how
matter
stand
,
he
think
it
high
time
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
put
a
speaking
-
trumpet
,
therefore
,
to
his
mouth
,
he
roar
out:"Sheer
off
,
or
I
will
sink
you!"The
<EOS>
warning
reach
the
ear
for
which
it
be
intend

but
produce
no

<EOS>
the
man
go
on

as
boldly
as
ever
,
determine
not

<EOS>
however

they
be
speedily

for
Captain
Hawker
turn
a
swivel

gun
upon
them
,
and
send
a
shot
through
the
bottom
of
their
boat
,
which
begin
presently
to
fill

and
compel
them
to
look
to
their
own
safety

<EOS>
be
now
disembarrass
from
his
pursuer
,
the
prince
get
safely
on
board
the
sloop
,
after
take
an
affectionate
leave

<EOS>
Their
duty

<EOS>
during
the
latter
year
of
Anne
,
who
be
so
much
and
so
deservedly
beloved
by
the
people
,
the
Jacobites
have
remain
quiescent
,
believe
that
in
the
political
crisis
certain
to
arise
on
the
queen

death
,
the
Chevalier
de
Saint
George
would
be
call
to

<EOS>
disappoint
in
this
expectation
,
they
determine
not
to
tolerate
a
rule
adverse
to
the
religion
of

hateful

that
after
his
solemn
assurance
,
and
the
opportunity
he
have
take
to
do
everything
that
may
tend
to
benefit
the
Church
of
England
,
it
be
unjust
and
ungrateful
to
doubt
him
,
and
he
refuse
to
believe
that
the
people
could
be
so
far
mislead
by
false
representation
as
to
desire
to
place
a
Popish
Pretender

furthermore
,
the

have
engage
to
make
a
descent
upon
our
western
coast

with
a
large
force

<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
Duke
of
Berwick
's

would
counterbalance
that
of
Marlborough
,
"
say
the
Marquis

but
we
must
not
count
upon
the

neither
must
we
depend
upon
the
fleet

be
bring
by
Ormond

Bolingbroke

<EOS>
these
be
doubtful
.
<EOS>

we

confidently
rely

""have

as

be
more
influential

<EOS>
His
step
be
free
,
his
glance
pierce
,
<EOS>
his
muscular
power
prodigious
,
and
he
could
still
run
as
fleetly
,

endure
as
much
fatigue
as
the
young

his

<EOS>
His

the

expression
be
cautious

perhaps
crafty

sometimes
so

inspire
terror

on

his
habitual
sternness
disappear

bonhomie

rigorous
disciplinarian

always

<EOS>
His
enemy
say
that
the
brigadier
do
not
object
to
plunder

and
that
his
maxim
be
that
war
should
pay
its
own
expense

this
be
a
principle
pretty
generally

there

against

"If

for
your
express
order

I
would
have
shut

<EOS>
She
say
,

Squire

may
be
forty

perhaps

complexion
seem
to
indicate
that
he
drink
hard

his
countenance

the
colonel
he

command
a
regiment

the
colonel
immediately
arise
to
leave
the
table

and
Lord
Derwentwater
insist
that
the
squire
should
at
once
withdraw
the
offensive
observation
.

instead
of
do
so
,
the
squire
spring
from
his
chair
,
draw
his
sword
,
and
dare
Colonel
Oxburgh
to
meet
him
;

while
gesticulate
fiercely
he
fall
to
the

could
not

the

reluctantly
allow
the

only
consent
from
the
fear
of

Charles
Radclyffe
be
much
the
light
weight

though
undoubtedly
the

have
the
strong
horse

<EOS>
It
be
a

pretty
sight

to

they

call
to

neither

both
dash
headlong
down

all

they
would
come
roll

if
ever
Squire

apply
to
his

it
be
on
that
day

Charles
Radclyffe
appear
little
less
crazy

the
general
impression
be
that
both
would
break
their
neck

somehow

the
horse
keep
their
foot

I

<EOS>
leave
me
to
deal
with
him

<EOS>
let
the
man
conceal
themselves
behind
the

so
that
he
may
not
suspect
the
presence
of
so
large
a
party

"since
<EOS>
no
harm
could
be
do
by
humour
the
eccentric
squire

Lord
Derwentwater

Mr.

comply
with
his

as

ride
off
they
conceal
their

he

make
aware
by

post
there

<EOS>

this
discovery
do
not
prevent
him
from
go
on
,
as
he
have
no
idea
the
rebel

do
not
imagine
they
could
muster
more
than
a

CHAPTER
xiiwarkworth
castlenext
day
,
the
two
insurgent
chiefs
,
who
be
lodge
with
all
their
follower
in
Warkworth
Castle
,
be
join
by
Lord
Widdrington
with
thirty
horseman
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
would
have
bring
double
that
number
of
man
,
but
horse
and
equipment
for
them
be
want
.
<EOS>
plenty
of
raw
undisciplined
infantry
could
be
find
,
but
cavalry
be
require
.
<EOS>
on
the
whole
,
however
,
the
prospect
of
the
insurgent
be
very
encouraging
.
<EOS>
They
have
plenty
of
friend
at
Alnwick
and
Morpeth
,
and
an
insurrection
would
undoubtedly
have
take
place
in
Newcastle
,
have
it
not
be
check
by
the
sudden
arrival
of
Sir
Charles
Hotham
's
regiment
of
foot
from
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
from
account
receive
from
every
quarter
it
be
certain
that
the
whole
country
be
in
a
most
disturbed
state
,
and
reinforcement
,
though
on
a
somewhat
small
scale
,
be
constantly
arrive
.
<EOS>
the
insurgent
have
not
be
many
hour
in
Warkworth
when
their
number
be
augment
by
a
hundred
horse
.
<EOS>
immediately
on
the
arrival
of
Lord
Widdrington
at
Warkworth
,
the
first
business
of
the
insurgent
leader
be
to
collect
all
their
force
in
the
courtyard
of
the
castle
,
and
proclaim
King
James
.
<EOS>
a
large
concourse
likewise
assemble
,
and
great
enthusiasm
prevail
.
<EOS>
no
locality
could
have
be
better
choose
for
the
ceremonial
,
which
produce
a
very
striking
effect
,
and
no
ill
oman
attend
it
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
everything
appear
auspicious
.
<EOS>
the
day
be
fine
,
and
the
proud
old
castle
look
its
good
,
and
seem
to
smile
upon
the
scene
.
<EOS>
after
the
proclamation
have
be
make
—
amid
loud
flourish
of
trumpet
and
beat
of
drum
,
accompany
by
the
shout
of
the
assemblage
—
the
royal
banner
be
place
on
the
Lion
Tower
.
<EOS>
later
on
in
the
day
,
a
banquet
be
give
in
the
great
baronial
hall
in
the
keep
,
at
which
all
the
insurgent
officer
assist
.
<EOS>
the
entertainment
be
intend
to
celebrate
the
appointment
of
Mr.
Forster
as
General
of
the
northumbrian
force
,
which
have
take
place
that
day
at
the
recommendation
of
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
and
Lord
Widdrington
,
the
only
person
who
could
have
oppose
him
.
<EOS>
but
they
both
feel
that
the
commander
of
the
english
army
must
not
be
a
Roman
Catholic
,
and
therefore
withdraw
their
own
claim
,
and
support
the
High
Tory
squire
,
who
be
generally
very
popular
in
the
county
,
and
to
whom
objection
on
the
score
of
religion
could
not
be
raise
.
<EOS>
however
deficient
Mr.
Forster
may
be
in
military
knowledge
and
skill
,
it
be
think
he
would
be
save
from
any
grave
error
by
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
whom
he
propose
to
have
constantly
near
him
.
<EOS>
the
banquet
pass
off
very
well
,
and
the
good
feeling
towards
the
new
commander
be
manifest
on
all
hand
.
<EOS>
some
little
disturbance
be
make
by
the
Laird
of
Otterburn
,
but
it
be
quickly
set
right
,
and
General
Forster
put
more
constraint
upon
himself
than
he
have
be
accustom
to
do
in
former
day
at
Bamborough
.
<EOS>
next
day
,
the
castle
begin
to
assume
the
appearance
of
a
garrison
.
<EOS>
the
court
-
yard
be
fill
with
recruit
,
who
be
continually
arrive
,
and
Colonel
Oxburgh
and
Captain
Wogan
be
entirely
occupy
in
examine
them
.
<EOS>
as
much
discipline
as
possible
be
observe
,
but
in
the
present
state
of
thing
it
be
very
difficult
to
maintain
it
.
<EOS>
General
Forster
ride
to
Alnwick
,
accompany
by
Lord
Derwentwater
and
Lord
Widdrington
,
and
attend
by
a
strong
guard
,
and
bring
back
with
him
some
necessary
supply
.
<EOS>
on
his
return
he
be
welcome
by
the
arrival
of
a
troop
of
Scottish
cavalry
(
know
as
the
Merse
Troop
)
,
under
the
command
of
the
honourable
James
Hume
,
brother
to
the
Earl
of
Hume
.
<EOS>
this
be
one
of
the
five
troop
compose
the
division
of
South
Country
Scots
now
march
into
England
,
from
Moffat
in
Annandale
,
and
command
by
Lord
Kenmure
.
<EOS>
the
Merse
troop
,
it
appear
,
have
march
from
Jedburgh
,
over
a
mountainous
and
marshy
country
to
Rothbury
,
where
Captain
Hume
hear
of
Forster
and
Lord
Derwentwater
,
and
find
they
be
now
post
at
Warkworth
,
come
on
thither
.
<EOS>
behind
,
but
follow
the
same
route
,
be
the
four
other
troop
,
respectively
command
by
the
Honourable
Basil
Hamilton
of
Beldoun
,
the
Earl
of
Wintoun
,
Captain
James
Dalziel
,
brother
of
the
Earl
of
Carnwath
,
and
Captain
Lockhart
.
<EOS>
the
chief
command
of
the
South
Country
Scots
,
as
we
have
say
,
belong
to
Lord
Kenmure
.
<EOS>
the
Merse
troop
do
not
remain
long
at
Warkworth
,
but
after
confer
with
General
Forster
,
Captain
Hume
move
off
with
his
man
to
Felton
,
there
to
await
instruction
from
his
commander
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
agree
that
an
early
meeting
should
take
place
at
Rothbury
between
the
northumbrian
insurgent
and
the
battalion
of
the
South
Country
Scots
.
<EOS>
by
noon
next
day
,
so
many
reinforcement
have
arrive
that
General
Forster
find
himself
at
the
head
of
nearly
five
hundred
man
.
<EOS>
unfavourable
news
,
however
,
from
Newcastle
,
cause
Forster
to
postpone
his
meditated
attack
on
the
town
.
<EOS>
extraordinary
exertion
have
be
make
by
Sir
William
Lorraine
and
the
other
magistrate
,
who
have
raise
train
-
band
,
seize
and
imprison
all
the
Papists
,
and
shut
the
gate
.
<EOS>
furthermore
,
it
be
state
that
seven
hundred
of
the
inhabitant
have
form
themselves
into
a
company
of
volunteer
,
and
that
the
keelman
,
most
of
whom
be
Presbyterians
,
and
strongly
opposed
to
the
Stuarts
,
have
offer
an
additional
body
of
seven
hundred
man
.
<EOS>
but
by
far
the
most
alarming
piece
of
intelligence
be
,
that
General
Carpenter
have
be
send
by
Government
in
pursuit
of
the
rebel
,
with
three
regiment
of
dragoon
and
Sir
Charles
Hotham
's
regiment
of
foot
,
and
be
now
within
a
day
's
march
of
Newcastle
.
<EOS>
after
consultation
with
his
adviser
,
General
Forster
do
not
think
it
prudent
to
give
battle
to
Carpenter
till
he
could
be
certain
of
the
support
of
Lord
Kenmure
and
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
and
he
therefore
determine
to
move
to
Hexham
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
on
the
follow
day
,
he
march
with
his
whole
force
to
Morpeth
,
and
on
the
common
near
the
town

by
the
Merse
troop
.
<EOS>
learn
that
General
Carpenter
have
reach
Newcastle
,
he
continue
his
march
to
Hexham
.
<EOS>
not
without
great
reluctance
be
the
propose
attack
on
Newcastle
abandon
by
the
insurgent
,
for
have
they
gain
that
important
town

they
would

of

,
and
after
search
the
old
tower
and
some
other
place
,
bring
back
all
the
arm

could
find
.
<EOS>
a
very
important
matter
have
now
to
be
settle
,
which
have
already
be
too
long
defer
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
organisation
of
the
force
,
and
in
carry
out
this
necessary
measure
Colonel
Oxburgh
be
of
utmost
use
.
<EOS>
after
some
deliberation
it
be
decide
that
the
division
command
by
General
Forster
should
consist
of
five
troop
,
of
which
that

<EOS>
the

the

the
first

whom
have
be
a
contraband

of
great
daring
and
skill
,
and
the
other
a
border
farmer
,
who
have
be
employ
by
Forster
in
search
for
horse
and
arm
,
and
have
be
extraordinarily
successful
.
<EOS>
some
objection
be
make
to
these
two
person
on
the
score
of
position
,
but
it
be
urge
by
Forster
that
they
would
be
of
great
use
.
<EOS>
the
fifth

last
troop
be

Captain
Wogan
.
<EOS>
the
first

second
troop
be
compose
of
gentleman

who
be
quite
as
well
mount
and
well
armed
as
their
leader
.
<EOS>
many
of
them
have
thoroughbre
horse
—
much
better
adapt
for
speed
than
endurance
—
and
the
rest
be
provide
with
hunter
.
<EOS>
not
be
able
to
procure
military
saddle
,
they
be
oblige
to
content
themselves
with
those
in
ordinary
use
;
and
their
equipment
be
by
no
mean
complete
.
<EOS>
still
,
in
spite
of
these
drawback
,
they
present
a
very
gallant
appearance
when
draw
up
in
the
market

CHAPTER
<EOS>
XIVThe
Earl
's
brief
visit
to
dilstonafter
the
business
of
the
day
be
conclude
General
Forster
and
the
officer
sit
down
to
dinner
,
but
Lord
Derwentwater
excuse
himself
from
join
the
party
as
he
wish
to
ride
over
to
Dilston
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
take
a
servant
with
him
,
and
say
he
should
return
by
midnight
.
<EOS>
It
be
grow
dusk
as
he
ride
through
the
wood
that
skirt
his
domain
,
but
it
be
quite
light
enough
to
enable
him
to
distinguish
the
castle
.
<EOS>
His
heart
be
sad
as
he
gaze
at
it
,
for
he
feel
he
could
not
remain
there
.
<EOS>
the
place
seem
his
own
no
longer
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
strove
to
stifle
those
painful
feeling
,
and
they
soon
give
way
to
other
emotion
.
<EOS>
still
,
he
could
not
banish
the
notion
that
the
place
be
change
,
though
in
what
respect
he
could
scarcely
tell
,
for
a
groom
come
to
take
his
horse
,
and
Newbiggin
welcome
him
at
the
entrance
,
and
with
a
manifestation
of
delight
that
could
not
fail
to
touch
his
master
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
hope
your
lordship
be
come
to
remain
with
us
—
at
least
,
for
a
few
day
?
"
say
the
butler
.
<EOS>
"Alas
!
<EOS>
no
,
"
reply
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
return
to
Hexham
to
-
night
,
and
to-
morrow
morning
we
march
to
Rothbury
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
butler
look
quite
cast
down
.
<EOS>
"I
fear
Dilston
will
never
again
be
what
it
be
,
my
lord
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
how
I
wish
your
lordship
could
give
up
this
perilous
expedition
and
return
to
us
.
<EOS>
""that
be
impossible
,
Newbiggin
,
"
say
the
earl
,
scarcely
able
to
repress
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
on
now
.
<EOS>
but
where
be
the
countess?""she
be
here
,
"
cry
a
well
-
know
voice
.
<EOS>
and
next
moment
she
fly
towards
him
,
and
be
clasp
in
his
arm
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
questionable
whether
Lord
Derwentwater
's
brief
visit
to
his
mansion
be
not
productive
of
more
pain
to
him
than
pleasure
.
<EOS>
so
many
fresh
anxiety
be
arouse
that
they
mar
his
happiness
,
and
the
moment
fly
by
so
quickly
that
they
seem
go
ere
they
could
be
number
.
<EOS>
how
much
have
he
to
say
to
the
countess
!
<EOS>
and
yet
how
little
be
say
.
<EOS>
half
the
time
they
sit
together
they
be
silent
,
but
it
be
a
silence
more
eloquent
than
word
.
<EOS>
and
when
the
countess
speak
it
be
ever
to
incite
him
to
brave
deed
.
<EOS>
after
awhile
they
be
join
by
Dorothy
Forster
and
Father
Norman
,
and
then
the
conversation
turn
chiefly
on
the
incident
of
the
march
.
<EOS>
the
countess
and
Dorothy
still
believe
that
the
insurrection
would
be
successful
,
but
the
priest
be
less
hopeful
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
where
and
when
will
the
battle
be
fight
that
be
to
give
the
crown
to
King
James
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
Dorothy
.
<EOS>
"that
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
you
,
"
reply
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
not
think
it
will
be
fight
in
Scotland
,
though
we
shall
probably
march
there
to
meet
our
ally
.
<EOS>
however
,
a
few
day
may
decide
.
<EOS>
General
Carpenter
be
now
at
Newcastle
,
with
four
regiment
of
dragoon
,
and
we
have
yet
to
learn
his
plan
.
<EOS>
Should
he
not
find
out
we
have
fly
,
he
may
march
to
attack
us
at
Hexham
,
and
then
you
will
see
him
here
.
<EOS>
"Never
<EOS>
do
the
devout
Earl
of
Derwentwater
neglect
his
religious
duty
.
<EOS>
Mass
be
therefore
perform
at
the
little
chapel
before
his
departure
,
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
service
he
do
not
reenter
the
mansion
,
but
tenderly
embrace
the
countess
,
bade
farewell
to
her
and
Dorothy
,
and
mount
his
dapple
-
grey
steed
take
his
way
alone
through
the
wood
to
Hexham
.

of

'
foot
behind
him
.
<EOS>
not
for
a
moment
imagine
it
could

highly
probable

messenger
may
have
be
send
after
him
by
the
countess
,
he
halt
.
<EOS>
"Is

<EOS>
no
immediate
answer
be
return
,
his
suspicion

especially
as
he

hear
the
two
horseman
,
who
have
now
come
up
,
talk
together
in
a
low
tone
—
and
he

cry
the
earl

"
reply
the
man
who

his

"
and
as
such
be
bind
to

all

<EOS>
We

,
preparatory
to

Lord

CHAPTER
IIMackintosh
's
achievementsbefore
proceed
,
it
may
be
necessary
briefly
to
explain
what
the
brigadier
have
accomplish
since
he
quit
Perth
about
ten
day
previously
.
<EOS>
at
that
time
,
the
detachment
under
his
command
consist
of
six
regiment
,
and
with
a
number
of
gentleman
volunteer
form
a
total
of
two
thousand
five
hundred
man
.
<EOS>
the
brigadier
's
order
from
the
Earl
of
Mar
be
to
get
as
many
man
as
he
could
over
the
Firth
,
and
though
the
channel
be
defend
by
ship
of
war
,
smack
,
and
boat
fill
with
armed
man
,
Mackintosh
courageously
make
the
attempt
,
and
despite
all
the
exertion
of
the
cruiser
to
prevent
him
,
succeed
in
reach
the
East
lothian
coast
with
fifteen
hundred
man
—
the
Earl
of
Strathmore
's
battalion
be
force
back
and
compel
to
go
on
shore
on
the
Isle
of
<EOS>
May
this
be
the
exploit
to
which
Lord
Kenmure
have
refer
in
term
of
such
high
admiration
.
<EOS>
with
the
troop
he
have
thus
bring
across
the
Firth
,
the
brigadier
at
once
march
to
Haddington
,
where
he
be
invite
by
the
Scottish
Jacobites
to
make
an
attempt
on
Edinburgh
,
and
unhesitatingly
comply
with
the
request
.
<EOS>
He
advance
as
far
as
Jock
's
Lodge
,
but
not
meet
with
the
promised
support
,
he
turn
to
Leith
,
and
take
possession
of
a
partly
-
demolish
fort
,
build
by
Oliver
Cromwell
,
and
proceed
to
barricade
it
.
<EOS>
next
day
the
Duke
of
Argyle
,
who
have
hasten
from
stirle
to
the
protection
of
Edinburgh
,
summon
him
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
on
his
refusal
,
the
duke
threaten
to
bombard
the
fort
on
the
morrow
,
but
in
the
night
Mackintosh
withdraw
,
and
conduct
his
man
cautiously
along
the
sand
at
low
water
to
Seaton
House
—
a
castle
belong
to
Lord
Wintoun
.
<EOS>
here
he
post
himself
securely
with
his
force
,
and
laugh
at
the
threat
of
Lord
Torpichen
and
the
Earl
of
Rothes
,
who
come
from
Edinburgh
to
dislodge
him
with
two
hundred
dragoon
and
three
hundred
volunteer
.
<EOS>
at
Seaton
House
he
remain
for
a
couple
of
day
,
and
in
that
short
interval
store
it
with
provision
to
stand
a
siege
,
when
he
learn
that
the
South
Country
Scots
and
Northumbrians
have
rise
,
and
receive
an
express
from
Forster
pray
him
to
meet
him
at
Coldstream
or
Kelso
.
<EOS>
another
express
come
from
the
Earl
of
Mar
bid
him
march
south
,
and
join
the
english
insurgent
.
<EOS>
the
latter
order
could
not
be
disobey
,
and
he
therefore
quit
the
stronghold
he
have
gain
,
and
march
to
Longformacus
,
harass
in
the
rear
by
the
Government
troop
.
<EOS>
but
this
pursuit
do
not
prevent
him
from
plunder
the
house
of
Doctor
Sinclair
,
who
have
incur
the
animosity
of
the
Jacobites
by
shoot
young
Hepburn
of
Keith
.
<EOS>
continue
his
march
to
Dunse
,
the
brigadier
rest
there
for
a
day
,
proclaim
James
the
Third
,
collect
the
excise
due
,
and
receive
the
very
satisfactory
intelligence
that
Sir
William
Bennet
have
abandon
Kelso
.
<EOS>
no
longer
trouble
by
the
Government
troop
,
and
renovate
by
the
much
-
need
repose
,
he
march
on
next
day
to
Kelso
,
and
be
meet
at
Ednam
Bridge
,
as
we
have
relate
,
by
the
Lowlanders
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
main
incident
that
have
occur
during
Mackintosh
's
memorable
march
towards
the
south
.
<EOS>
He
have
prove
himself
a
thoroughly
good
soldier
,
equal
to
every
emergency
,
and
not
to
be
check
by
danger
or
difficulty
,
and
fully
deserve
the
encomium
pass
upon
him
by
Lord
Kenmure
.
<EOS>
as
the
Highlanders
enter
Kelso
,
with
bagpipe
play
,
colour
flying
,
and
drum
beat
,
the
inhabitant
flock
forth
to
gaze
at
them
,
and
be
greatly
strike
by
the
stalwart
appearance
and
martial
bearing
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
of
whose
doing
so
much
have
be
hear
,
excite
great
curiosity
,
and
the
tall
figure
,
strongly
marked
feature
,
and
athletic
limb
of
the
veteran
warrior
would
have
point
him
out
to
all
beholder
,
even
if
he
have
not
march
at
the
head
of
his
detachment
.
<EOS>
throughout
their
progress
neither
the
brigadier
nor
any
of
his
officer
have
mount
a
horse
,
but
march
on
foot
with
the
man
and
cross
all
river
in
their
Highland
garb
.
<EOS>
amongst
those
who
attract
most
attention
be
Lord
Charles
Murray
,
who
be
remarkable
for
his
graceful
person
and
good
look
.
<EOS>
Lord
Nairn
and
some
of
the
subaltern
officer
be
also
think
very
fine
man
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
Highlanders
generally
produce
a
favourable
impression
on
the
good
folk
of
Kelso
,
who
give
them
a
far
warm
welcome
than
they
have
accord
to
their
ally
.
<EOS>
the
junction
between
the
confederate
force
form
a
curious
and
interesting
scene
.
<EOS>
when
the
brigadier
first
beheld
the
northumbrian
detachment
draw
up
in
the
market
-
place
,
he
be
strike
by
the
handsome
show
make
by
both
horse
and
man
,
but
when
he
begin
to
scrutinise
them
,
he
quickly
change
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
"saul
<EOS>

<EOS>

will
never

"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
to
Lord
Charles

.
"
<EOS>
those

<EOS>

his

or
a

his
hand

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
They

get
basket

hilte
broad

like
our

saddle
wi

high
pommel
and
holster
,
and
as
to
those

I
should

them
across

<EOS>
""the

man
certainly
look
better
equipped
for
flight
than
for
attack
,
"
reply
Lord
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
but
we
must
not
judge
them
too
harshly

<EOS>
They

""vera

Lord

in
an
undertone

find
that

an

thousand

<EOS>
though

so
much
confidence

now
feel
in
Mackintosh

such
strong
hope

<EOS>
on

<EOS>
a
warm
tribute
be
pay
by
Lord

to
the
valour
and
skill
of
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
with
which
the
veteran
warrior
be
much
gratify

<EOS>
next
day
,
be
Sunday
,
great
discretion
have
to
be
use
by
the
leader
of
an
army
compose
of
Presbyterians
,
High
Church
Tories
,
and
Roman
Catholics
.
<EOS>
that
such
discordant
element
could
be
reconcile
—
even
for
a
brief
season
—
seem
impossible
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
by
the
judicious
management
of
Lord
Kenmure
,
who
retain
the
command
of
the
confederate
force
so
long
as
it
continue
in
Scotland
,
the
thing
be
accomplish
.
<EOS>
at
this
time
,
three
clergyman
be
attach
to
the
expedition
—
the
Reverend
William
Irvine
,
chaplain
to
the
Earl
of
Carnwath
,
an
Episcopalian
and
Nonjuror
—
the
Reverend
Robert
Patten
,
of
Allendale
,
who
belong
to
the
High
Church
,
and
have
just
be
appoint
chaplain
to
General
Forster
—
and
<EOS>
the
Reverend
Mr.
Buxton
,
likewise
a
Church
of
England
divine
,
who
may
be
consider
chaplain
to
the
entire
english
force
,
since
there
be
no
roman
catholic
priest
.
<EOS>
by
Lord
Kenmure
's
order
all
the
officer
and
man
attend
at
the
Great
Kirk
,
where
the
Church
of
England
service
be
perform
.
<EOS>
the
large
congregation
thus
assemble
present
an
extraordinary
sight
,
and
the
behaviour
of
the
man
be
extremely
decorous
—
that
of
the
Highlanders
especially
so
.
<EOS>
They
nearly
fill
the
body
of
the
sacred
edifice
,
and
listen
with
devout
attention
to
the
discourse
of
Mr.
Patten
,
who
take
for
his
text
,
"
<EOS>
the
right

it
to
the

<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
,
an

of
Highlanders

to

the

Nonjuror

who
treat
them
to
a
sermon
he
have
preach
to
Lord
Dundee
before
the
battle
of
Killiecrankie
.
<EOS>
It
be
think
that
this
fiery
sermon
be
give
in
deference
to
the
wish
of
Brigadier
Mackintosh
;
and
it
would
almost
seem
so
,
since
the
old
Highlander
listen
to
it
with
profound
attention
,
and
afterwards
express
his
satisfaction
to
the
preacher
.
<EOS>
a
very
favourable
impression
be
produce
on
the
Kelso
folk
by
the
exemplary
conduct
of
the
troop
on
the
Sabbath
;
but
they
be
not
quite
so
well
pleased
when
Mackintosh
next
morning
,
while
search
for
arm
,
discover
several
barrel
of
gunpowder
conceal
in
the
vault
of
the
kirk
,
and
swear
if
he
could
catch
the
traitor
who
have
place
them
there
,
he
would
hang
them
like
dog
.
<EOS>
the
brigadier
be
likewise
extraordinarily
active
in
forage
and
plunder
,
and
seize
all
the
public
revenue
without
scruple
.
<EOS>
under
other
circumstance
Lord
Derwentwater
would
have
enjoy
his
visit
to
Kelso
,
but
his
mind
be
so
troubled
,
that
even
Roxburgh
Castle
,
Floors
,
or
the
charming
view
of
the
Tweed
and
the
Teviot
afford
him
very
little
pleasure
.

His
heart
be
at

Kenmure
to
watch
the
movement
of
the
Government
troop
,
bring
word
that
General
Carpenter
have
reach
Wooler
with
a
force
of
nine
hundred
man
,
consist
of
Hotham
's
regiment
of
foot
,
and
three
regiment
of
dragoon
,
and
intend
next
day
to
attack
Kelso
.
<EOS>
on
receipt
of
this
important
intelligence
,
a
council
of
war
be
immediately
summon
,
which
be
attend
by
all
the
commander
and
officer
.
<EOS>
the
main
point
to
be
consider
be
whether
they
should
await
the
English
general
's
attack
at
Kelso
,
and
barricade
the
town
,
or
cross
the
Tweed
,
and
meet
him
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
be
decidedly
of
opinion
that
the
latter
course
should
be
adopt
,
and
maintain
that
their
force
be
double
that
of
Carpenter
,
<EOS>
the
result
of
an
engagement
could
not
be
doubtful
—
although
the
Government
general
possess
three
regiment
of
experienced
dragoon
.
<EOS>
but
his
advice
,
though
approve
by
General
Forster
and
the
english
officer
,
be
oppose
by
the
Earl
of
Wintoun
.
<EOS>
"as
<EOS>
Scotsmen
,
"
say
his
lordship
,
"
we
be
best
able
to
serve
the
king
's
cause
in
our
own
country
,
and
be
therefore
most
reluctant
to
cross
the
Border
.
<EOS>
be
it
not
so
?
"
<EOS>
he
add
,
appeal
to
his
compatriot
—
all
of
whom
assent
,
except
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
you
have
the
Earl
of
Mar
's
order
to
advance
,
"
remark
General
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
disobey
<EOS>
them?""the
<EOS>
earl
of
Mar
be
not
aware
of
our
exact
position
,
"
reply
Lord
Wintoun
,
"
or
his
order
would
be
countermand
.
<EOS>
at
present
,
all
communication
with
him
be
difficult
,
and
if
we
enter
England
it
will
be
entirely
cut
off
.
<EOS>
but
it
may
be
open
—
and
this
be
the
plan
of
operation
I
would
recommend
.
<EOS>
fall
back
to
the
north
-
west
,
attack
Dumfries
and
Glasgow
on
our
way
,
we
shall
be
able
to
join
the
Western
Clans
,
and
,
combine
with
them
,
can
either
cross
the
Firth
above
Stirling
,
or
proceed
as
the
Earl
of
Mar
may
direct
.
<EOS>
"This
proposition
be
manifestly
to
the
taste
of
the
scottish
leader
,
most
of
whom
signify
their
approval
of
it
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
why
throw
away
our
present
chance
?
"
cry
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
why
not
attack
Carpenter
when
we
can
do
so
with
every
advantage
?
<EOS>
from
the
report
just
receive
he
be
greatly
our
inferior
in
number
,
and
his
troop
be
exhaust
.
<EOS>
the
prestige
of
a
victory
would
be
of
immense
service
to
the
cause
.
<EOS>
""we
do
not
care
to
cross
the
Tweed
,
"
again
object
Lord
Wintoun
.
<EOS>
"if
you
will
not
cross
the
Tweed
,
my
lord
,
General
Carpenter
will
,
"
rejoin
Lord
Derwentwater
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"he
will
gain
little
by
the
movement
,
"
retort
Lord
Wintoun
.
<EOS>
"
He
will
find
Kelso
evacuate
,
and
will
not
dare
follow
us
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
this
the
sort
of
fighting
<EOS>
we
be
to
expect
?
"
cry
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
be
we
always
to
retreat
on
the
appearance
of
the
foe
?
<EOS>
We
Northumbrians
do
not
come
to
Scotland
to
join
the
Western
Clans
,
but
to
meet
our
brave
ally
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
who
be
pledge
to
march
with
us
to
London
,
and
we
claim
fulfilment
of
his
promise
.
<EOS>
as
to
General
Carpenter
,
if
our
ally
will
not
help
us
,
we
will
attack
him
alone
.
<EOS>
do
I
not
express
your
sentiment
,
general
?
<EOS>
"
he
add
to
Forster
.
<EOS>
"my
<EOS>
opinion
decidedly
be
,
that
Carpenter
ought
to
be
meet
by
the
whole
confederate
force
,
"
say
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
My
own
division
be
not
strong
enough
to
encounter
him

would
incur
certain
defeat

<EOS>
""again
,
I
say
,
the
Scots
will
not
cross
the
Tweed

"
remark
Lord
Wintoun
.
<EOS>
"
if

choose
to

we
may

we
can

"Lord

place
his

when
Lord
Derwentwater

he
will
regret

speak
thus
hastily

<EOS>
as

,
I
be

in

""We

somewhat
evasively

they
ride

the

Scots

up
on

in

have
halt
to

General

believe
he

these

""Captain

to

determine
to
reconnoitre

request
Captain

to
accompany
him

set
off
with
a
small
party

Yetholms

nothing
occur

be
on

come
within
a
couple
of
mile
of
Kirk

Yetholm
,
when
,
from
the
brow
of
a
hill
,
he
distinguish
their
vanguard

at
once
comprehend
that
a
part
of
the
force
,
if
not
the
whole
,
must
be
march
to
Kelso

<EOS>
satisfied
with
what
he
have
see
,
and
begin
to
be
of
opinion
that
General
Carpenter
would
not
have
be
so
easily
surprised

he
imagine
,
he
turn
back
,

ride
quickly

overtook
the

it
reach
Hawick

It
afterwards
appear

<EOS>

the
day
will
come

you

""Meantime

<EOS>
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
however
,
have
a
difficult
task
to
get
his
man
to
move
.
<EOS>
when
they
understand
it
be
decide
that
the
force
should
march
into
England
,
a
portion
of
the
Highlanders
again
rebel
,
and
refuse
to
proceed
further
.
<EOS>
once
more
the
brigadier
try
the
effect
of
persuasion
,
and
partly
by
promise
—
partly
by
threat
—
induce
the
man
to
follow
him
.
<EOS>
They
go
on
very
reluctantly
for
three
or
four
mile
,
till
they
draw
near
the
Esk
,
when
the
mutineer
separate
themselves
from
their
comrade
,
run
towards
the
river
,
with
the
intention
of
cross
it
and
fly
towards
Ecclefechan
.
<EOS>
but
the
brigadier
be
beforehand
with
them
,
and
plunge
into
the
stream
,
draw
his
sword
,
and
swear
he
would
cut
down
the
first
who
enter
the
water
.
<EOS>
His
aspect
be
so
grim
and
terrible
that
he
hold
them
in
check
for
a
few
minute
,
during
which
he
be
able
to
reassert
his
authority
,
and
eventually
he
succeed
in
drive
a
great
number
of
them
back
to
the
rank
.
<EOS>
the
confederate
force
halt
at
Langholm
,
but
do
not
rest
there
for
the
night
,
as
it
be
deem
advisable
by
the
scottish
leader
to
enter
England
without
delay
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
they
march
on
to
Longtown
,
in
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
on
that
very
day
,
Brigadier
Stanwix
,
Governor
of
Carlisle
,
with
sixty
militiaman
,
have
ride
over
to
Longtown
,
but
could
obtain
no
precise
information

the
movement
of
the
rebel
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
hear
of
at
Hawick
,
but
it
be
think
they
would
turn
to
the
west
,
and
cross
the
mountain
join
the
Earl
of
March
<EOS>
no
suspicion
be
entertain
that
they
be
march
into
England
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
as
we
have
show
,
their
own
plan
be
undecided
,
until
they
meet
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
General
Carpenter
likewise
be
mislead
by
the
intelligence
he
receive
,
and
follow
the
insurgent
no
further
than
Jedburgh
.
<EOS>
receive
no
further
tiding
,
and
be
in
great
want
of
forage
for
his
troop
,
he
then
return
to
Newcastle
.
<EOS>
thus
owe
to
a
variety
of
circumstance
,
the
rebel
gain
two
day
on
their
enemy
.
<EOS>
They
take
every
possible
precaution
to
prevent
their
arrival
at
Longtown
from
become
know
,
and
be
march
joyously
to
Brampton

in

—
a

news
of
their
victory
have
precede
them
,
and
dispose
the
inhabitant
—
many
of
whom
be
Jacobites
—
to
receive
them
cordially
.
<EOS>
even
by
the
lead
man
of
the
opposite
party
the
great
civility
be
show
them
.
<EOS>
in
anticipation
of
the
defeat
of
the
rebel
,
a
plentiful
supper
have
be
provide
at
the
principal
inn
for
the
Bishop
of
Carlisle
,
Lord

,
Sir
Christopher

,
and
their

<EOS>
to
this
supper
General
Forster
and
the
whole
of
the
insurgent
leader
—
except
those
absent
on
duty
—
sit
down
;
and
as
circumstance
give
peculiar
zest
to
the
entertainment
,
they
pass
the
merry
evening
they
have
do
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
the
party
sit
late
,
and
have
not
break
up
when
Colonel
Oxburgh
and
the
two
other
officer
return
.
<EOS>
some
arm
be
bring
from
Lowther
Castle
and
Edenhall
—
but
no
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Lord
Lowther
,
it
appear
,
have
flee
to
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
what
have
become
of
the
Bishop
of
Carlisle
and
Sir
Christopher
Musgrave
could
not
be
ascertain
.
<EOS>
General
Forster
be
greatly
disappointed
,
as
he
feel
that
the
capture
of
three
such
important
personage
—
or
even
one
of
them
—
would
have
give
him
great
credit
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
be
fain
to
be
content
with
the
success
he
have
achieve
.
<EOS>
next
day
,
the
general
perform
an
act
that
raise
him
considerably
in
the
estimation
of
the
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
have
find
out
that
some
High
Church
Tories
belong
to
his
own
division
intend
to
pull
down
,
or
burn
a
presbyterian
meeting
-
house
in
the
town
,
he
peremptorily
forbid
them
,
declare
he
would
punish
any
who
disobey
his
order
.
<EOS>
"I
will
never
sanction
religious
outrage
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
show
the
country
that
all
sect
can
live
tranquilly
together
.
<EOS>
My
maxim
be
toleration
.
<EOS>
though
I
differ
with
the
Presbyterians
,
I
will
,
on
no
account
,
allow
them
to
be
molest
.
<EOS>
"This
expression
,
which
be
repeat
,
do
him
great
service
.
<EOS>
during
their
stay
in
Penrith
,
the
insurgent
be
very
well
treat
,
and
make
many
friend
.
<EOS>
They
expect
to
be
join

several
important
Roman
Catholics

Castle

learn
to
their
dismay
that
they
have
all
be
arrest
by
the
Governor
of
Carlisle
,
and
secure
in
the
castle
.
<EOS>
before
quit
Penrith
,
they
collect
five
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
at
the
charming
town
of
Appleby
,
always
note
for
its
loyalty
,
they
be
very
well
receive
,
and
take
possession
of
the
church
and
castle
.
<EOS>
General
Forster
immediately
cause
James
the
Third
to
be
proclaim
,
and
so
much
enthusiasm
be
manifest
that
it
may
have
be
think
that
the
inhabitant
be
all
devote
to
the
Stuarts
.
<EOS>
gratify
by
their
reception
,
and
delight
by
the
beauty
of
the
town
,
the
insurgent
pass
their
time
very
pleasantly
,
and
be
reluctant
to
proceed
on
their
march
.
<EOS>
at

,
Mr.

a
relation
of
Sir

Graham
,
wish
to
effect
an
exchange
,
but
the
Governor
of

would
not
listen
to
the
proposal
.
<EOS>
several
person
,
suspect
of

,
be
seize

detain
,
and
an
impracticable
officer
be
confine
in
the
Moot
Hall
till
he
confess
where
the

money
be

.
<EOS>
Their
next
march
be
to
Kendal
,
where
General
Forster
be
quarter
at
the
house
of
Alderman
Simpson
,
in
Strickland
Gate

<EOS>
It
chance
that
his

,
Mrs.

,
be
stay
there
at
the
time
,
and
hear
this
the
general
desire
to
pay
his
respect

<EOS>
however
,
as
he

alarm
by
the
furious
expression
of
her
countenance
,
Forster
would
have
turn
back
,
but
she
command
him
to
stay
.
<EOS>
think
to
deprecate
her
wrath
,
the
general
express
his
great
pleasure
at
see
her
,
and
hope
she
be
quite
well

and
however
disagreeable
it
may
be
to
you
to
hear
it

I
must
say
that
I
look
upon
the
Elector
of
Hanover
as
a
usurper
,
and
I
shall
do
my
good
to
drive
him
from

""You

I
scarcely

CHAPTER
iiihornby
castlewhile
the
rest
of
the
force
proceed
to
Lancaster
,
shape
their
course
along
the
lovely
valley
of
the
Lune
,
and
keep
near
the
bank
of
the
river
,
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
with
a
party
of
horse
,
compose
entirely
of
gentleman
,
go
to
Hornby
Castle
for
the
purpose
of
arrest
its
owner
,
Colonel
Charteris
,
and
take
him
a
prisoner
to
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Charteris
,
condemn
to
deathless
infamy
by
Hogarth
,
belong
to
a
Scotch
family
,
and
have
render
himself
so
odious
to
his
countryman
by
his
vice
,
that
,
if
the
Highlanders
have
be
allow
to
visit
Hornby
Castle
,
they
would
undoubtedly
have
burn
it
to
the
ground
,
and
have
shoot
its
owner
if
they
have
catch
him
.
<EOS>
a
profligate
debauchee
of
the
bad
kind
,
Colonel
Charteris
be
also
one
of
the
mean
of
man
,
and
cunne
as
mean
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
very
rich
,
and
about
two
year
prior
to
the
date
of
our
story
,
he
have
purchase
Hornby
Castle
,
where
he
now
dwelt
,
from
the
Earl
of
Cardigan
,
for
fifteen
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
He
have
make
some
alteration
—
but
not
improvement
—
in
the
place
,
and
have
disfigure
the
old
keep
by
rear
a
watch
-
tower
on
its
summit
,
above
which
he
fix
a
great
gilt
eagle
.
<EOS>
from
its
bold
position
on
a
craggy
hill
,
the
side
of
which
be
clothe
with
timber
,
while
its
base
be
wash
by
the
river
Wenning
,
Hornby
Castle
,
before
its
partial
demolition
in
the
Civil
Wars
,
must
have
present
a
very
striking
appearance
.
<EOS>
the
ancient
part
of
the
structure
be
now
in
ruin
—
all
that
remain
of
it
be
a
few
picturesque
wall
overgrow
with
ivy
,
and
the
great
square
tower
,
to
which
allusion
have
just
be
make
.
<EOS>
adjoin
these
ruin
,
and
to
a
certain
degree
combine
with
them
,
be
a
large
modern
stone
mansion
,
in
front
of
which
a
steep
lawn
descend
,
between
avenue
of
timber
,
to
the
park
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
no
information
respect
Colonel
Charteris
could
be
obtain
at
the
pretty
little
village
of
Hornby
.
<EOS>
the
inhabitant
could
not
,
or
would
not
,
tell
whether
he
be
at
the
castle
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
therefore
,
in
a
state
of
the
utmost
uncertainty
that
Colonel
Oxburgh
and
his
troop
mount
the
steep
ascent
.
<EOS>
the
probability
,
indeed
,
seem
that
a
person
so
cautious
as
Colonel
Charteris
would
have
decamp
on
hear
that
the
insurgent
be
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
on
approach
the
castle
,
which
he
think
much
too
good
for
its
unworthy
owner
,
Colonel
Oxburgh
ride
up
to
the
principal
entrance
and
cause
the
bell
to
be
loudly
ring
.
<EOS>
hitherto
,
no
servant
have
appear
from
whom
inquiry
could
be
make
,
and
it
would
almost
seem
that
the
place
be
desert
.
<EOS>
the
summon
,
however
,
be
promptly
answer
by
a
porter
,
who
state
that
his
master
have
go
to
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
"Who
be
in
the
castle
,
then
?
"
demand
Colonel
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
"
take
care
you
do
not
deceive
me
,
fellow
.
<EOS>
""Only
<EOS>
Mr.
Bancroft
,
the
steward
,
and
two
old
woman
,
"
reply
the
porter
.
"
<EOS>
Colonel
Charteris
have
take
all
the
rest
of
the
servant
with
him
to
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
but
here
come
Mr.
Bancroft
.
<EOS>
"As
he
speak
,
a
singular

look
individual
make
his
appearance
,
and
descend
the

respectfully
salute
the

leader

<EOS>
Mr

high

He

a

the
visitor

<EOS>
"Colonel

Charteris

he

.
<EOS>
"
He
go
to
Lancaster
yesterday
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
I
have
just
hear

"
reply
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
you
must
excuse
me

Mr.
Bancroft

VHow
the
Prisoners
in
Lancaster
Castle
<EOS>
be
releasedFAR
from
present
a
stern
and
threatening
aspect
to
the
rebel
,
the
old
town
of
Lancaster
seem
to
smile
upon
them
as
they
approach
it
.
<EOS>
the
sun
shine
brightly
on
the
castle
hill
,
give
a
cheerful
air
to
the
ancient
fortress
that
crown
it
,
and
no
cannon
be
plant
at
its
wall
.
<EOS>
no
militia
,
no
dragoon
,
be
draw
to
dispute
the
passage
of
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
a
great
number
of
lady
and
gentleman
be
collect
there
,
mingle
with
the
townsfolk
—
most
of
whom
be
in
their
holiday
attire
—
to
give
them
welcome
.
<EOS>
head
by
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
,
mount
on
his
dapple
-
grey
steed
which
have
bear
him
well
throughout
the
whole
of
the
long
march
,
the
insurgent
come
joyously
on
,
and
be
receive
with
shout
by
the
concourse
assemble
at
the
foot
of
the
bridge
—
the
lady
wave
their
kerchief
enthusiastically
.
<EOS>
the
good
look
and
chivalrous
appearance
of
the
earl
be
well
calculated
to
impress
the
female
portion
of
the
beholder
,
who
manifest
their
admiration
in
the
way
we
have
state
.
<EOS>
ride
with
his
sword
unsheathed
,
Lord
Derwentwater
occasionally
bow
in
acknowledgment
of
the
attention
pay
him
.
<EOS>
close
behind
him
ride
his
brother
,
Charles
Radclyffe
,
and
Captain
Wogan
,
both
of
whom
be
think
handsome
man
,
but
nothing
compare
with
the
earl
,
who
captivate
all
the
lady
of
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
entirely
compose
of
gentleman
of
good
family
,
almost
all
of
them
young
,
very
well
dressed
,
and
extremely
well
mounted
,
and
of
course
not
have
at
all
the
air
of
common
soldier
,
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
's
regiment
cause
great
excitement
.
<EOS>
flatter
by
their
reception
,
these
young
gentleman
bow
to
the
lady
,
and
in
some
instance
persuade
themselves
that
their
salutation
be
return
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
may
have
be
so
,
since
it
be
certain
the
lady
be
not
displeased
.
<EOS>
General
Forster
be
not
so
much
admired
,
and
the
lady
declare
he
be
not
fit
to
have
the
command
of
such
an
army
;
but
they
praise
Lord
Widdrington
's
regiment
,
and
wonder
how
so
many
fine
young
man
could
have
be
get
together
.
<EOS>
the
scottish
noble
and
the
Lowland
corp
delight
them
,
but
they
be
quite
astounded
by
the
Highlanders
,
with
whose
picturesque
garb
they
be
not
familiar
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
help
contrast
these
fierce
-
look
savage
,
as
they
style
them
,
with
the
handsome
Englishmen
,
and
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
with
his
tall
,
stalwart
figure
and
grim
countenance
fill
them
with
terror
.
<EOS>
after
cross
the
bridge
without
any
other
interruption
,
except
the
very
agreeable
one
describe
,
the
insurgent
army
march
to
the
market
-
place
,
follow
by
an
immense
concourse
.
<EOS>
here
the
Highlanders
form
themselves
in
a
body
round
the
cross
,
and
the
whole
of
the
cavalry
,
have
their
sword
bare
,
draw
up
around
them
.
<EOS>
General
Forster
with

and
enter
the

great
care
in
a
small

<EOS>
suspect
that
the
man
's
design
be
to
afford
information
to
the
Government
,
Captain
Gordon
go
to
the
shop
as
soon
as
the

individual

<EOS>
interrogate
by
Captain

,
Hopkins

<EOS>
a

upon
the
lead
of
the

and

<EOS>
several

"CHAPTER

VILancashire
witchesnever
have
Lancaster

so
gay

during
its

<EOS>
instead
of
show
themselves
hostile
,
as
have

the
majority
of

prove
exceedingly
friendly

<EOS>
at

they

they

thus
enable
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the

<EOS>
as
these
young
trooper
could
not
be
distinguish
either
in
manner
or
attire
from
their
officer
,
they
be
frequently
question
as
to
their
actual
military
rank
,
and
give
something
like
the
follow
explanation
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
our
regiment
there
be
no
common
man
.
<EOS>
We
serve
as
gentleman
,
and
be
treat
like
gentleman
by
our
officer

<EOS>
but
though
we
consider
ourselves
quite
equal
to
our
leader
,
we
unhesitatingly
obey
them
.
<EOS>
by
us
the
word
of
command
be
never

.
<EOS>
though
most
of
us
have
groom

each
of

attend
to
his

horse

and
you

how
well
the
horse
look

in

<EOS>
We
be
never
out

<EOS>
We
take
the
rough
and
the
smooth
,
as
they
come
.
<EOS>
hitherto
,
we
have
have
plenty
of
rough
work
,
and
very
little
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
the
'
smooth
'
have
come
at
last
.
<EOS>
the
kindness
and
courtesy
of
the
gentleman
of
Lancaster
,
and
the
attention
show
us
by
the
lady
,
make
ample
amend
for
previous
hardship

<EOS>
"Such
be
the
account
of
themselves
give
by
the
handsome
young
trooper
,
and
listen
to
with
the
great
interest
by
the
lady
,
who
think
that
a
regiment
compose
entirely
of
gentleman
must
be
victorious
either
in
love
or
war
.
<EOS>
It
happen
,
singularly
enough
,
at
the
time
of
the
Jacobite
expedition
,
that
Lancaster
and
Preston
abound
in
pretty
girl
.
<EOS>
always
fame
for
the
beauty
and
fascination
of
the
fair
sex
—
who
have
be
designate
the
"
Lancashire
witch
"
—
the
whole
county
be
remarkably
rich
in
feminine
attraction
at
that
particular
juncture
.
<EOS>
of
the
Preston
belle
we
shall
speak
hereafter
.
<EOS>
for
the
present
,
we
must
confine
ourselves
to
the
beauty
of
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
if
we
say
there
be
a
hundred
really
handsome
young
woman
in
Lancaster
at
the
time
of
which
we
speak
,
we
should
be
under
the
mark
.
<EOS>
We
believe
there
be
double
the
number
,
and
they
be
all
as
gay
and
good

humoured
as
they
be
beautiful
.
<EOS>
since
we
can
not
describe
them
all
,
we
shall
select
three
of
the
most
attractive
—
namely
,
Dryope
Dutton

Nicola
Glasson

and
Aurelia

<EOS>

all

know
how
to
set
off
their
charm
to
advantage
by
dress

<EOS>
Dryope
Dutton
,
however
,
be
consider
the
pretty
girl
in
Lancaster
,
and
have
the
great
number
of
admirer
,
all
of
whom
be
send
about
their
business
on
the
arrival
of
the
rebel
army
,
their
place
be
immediately
fill
by
gallant
young
insurgent
.
<EOS>
none
of
her
new
suitor
be
discourage
by
Dryope
,
but
she
appear
to
have
a
decide
preference
for
Captain
Shaftoe
.
<EOS>
follow
Dryope
's
example
,
Nicola
and
Aurelia
,
dismiss
their
lover
,
and
lay
themselves
out
to
captivate
the
new
-
comer
,
in
which
design
they
be
eminently
successful
.
<EOS>
the
rest
of
the
pretty
girl
do
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
none
of
them
would
now
be
see
without
a
Jacobite
admirer
.
<EOS>
during
their
stay
at
Lancaster
nothing
be
think
of
but
flirt
by
the
amorous
youth
,
who
be
completely
enthral
by
their
lady
-
love
,
and
have
these
syren
desire
to
turn
them
from
their
cause
,
we
fear
they
may
have
succeed
.
<EOS>
luckily
,
all
the
girl
profess
themselves
ardent
Jacobites
,
and
if
they
fancy
their
lover
be
lukewarm
,
strenuously
urge
them
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
as
we
have
intimate
,
the
town
now
present
a
very
lively
appearance
.
<EOS>
not
only
be
the
terrace
near
the
castle
throng
with
handsome
young
trooper
and
charming
girl
;
but
when
the
promenade
be
over
,
the
company
wander
about
the
street
,
visit
the
market
-
place
,
the
town
-
hall
,
the
custom
-
house
,
the
quay
and
the
bridge
,
and
stroll
on
the
bank
of
the
Lune
.
<EOS>
on
Sunday
,
Saint
Mary
's
Church
be
crowd
by
the
same
young
lady
,
who
express
a
great
desire
to
hear
the
Reverend
Mr.
Paul
,
who
have
recently
join
the
expedition
,
read
prayer
,
and
Mr.
Patten
preach
;
but
it
may
be
doubt
whether
they
be
not
still
more
anxious
to
meet
their
admirer
.
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
may
,
when
the
service
be
over
,
the
lady
congregate
in
the
churchyard
,
and
each
fair
girl
be
escort
home
by
the
trooper
she
prefer
.
<EOS>
whether
all
this
flirting
be
approve
of
by
the
mamma
of
the
young
lady
in
question
we
will
not
pretend
to
say
.
<EOS>
no
effort
be
make
to
check
it
.
<EOS>
neither
do
the
officer
of
the
regiment
to
which
the
young
man
belong
interfere
—
<EOS>
well
know
interference
would
be
useless
—
so
it
go
on
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
the
day
of
parting
come
,
and
a
very
sad
day
it
be
both
for
the
enamoured
young

and
their
lady

<EOS>
how
many

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
"The

young

vow
they
be
an

<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
no

<EOS>
"
they
cry

<EOS>

We
will
always
remain
faithful
.
<EOS>
Preston
may
be
full
of
pretty
girl
—
as
they
say
it
be
—
but
they
will
have
no
attraction
for
us
.
<EOS>
""don't
<EOS>
be
surprised
if
we
come
to
look
after
you
,
"
say
Dryope
,
to
Captain
Shaftoe
;
"
and
if
we
find
you
false
and
forsworn?""How
<EOS>
can
you
suppose
I
could
be
false
to
you
,
sweetest
Dryope
?
"
say
Shaftoe
;
stop
her
mouth
with
a
kiss
.
<EOS>
"
think
it
not
.
<EOS>
but
I
fear
you
will
not
come
to
Preston
.
<EOS>
""Yes
<EOS>
,
I
will
—
<EOS>
if
I
can

that
I

"
she
rejoin

<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
I
will
only
bid
you
adieu
for
a
short
time
,
"
he
say
,
kiss
her
once
more
as
he
spring
to
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
many
more
parting
,
equally
tender
,
take
place
.
<EOS>
many
a
bright
eye
be
dim
,
as
the
regiment
to
which
the
handsome
trooper
belong
quit
Lancaster
,
and
take
the
road
to
Preston
.
<EOS>
full
of
sadness
be
the
young
man
as
they
look
back
at
the
fair
creature
they
be
leave
;
and
have
they
be
tell
at
the
moment
that
they
would
soon
forget
them
they
would
have
resent
the
imputation
.
<EOS>
We
shall
see
how
they
behave
at
Preston
.
<EOS>
in
quit
Lancaster
,
where
he
be
so
well
receive
,
and
where
he
be
constantly
receive
slight
accession
to
his
force
,
General
Forster
commit
a
grave
error
.
<EOS>
at
Lancaster
he
have
a
strong
castle
which
may
have
be
garrison
and
provision
,
and
could
certainly
have
be
hold
till
assistance
arrive
from
Scotland
;
while
not
far
from
the
town
be
a
seaport
whence
succour
could
be
obtain
from
France
.
<EOS>
these
advantage
be
point
out
to
him
by
Lord
Derwentwater
,
but
he
reply
that
his
object
in
march
to
Preston
be
to
secure
Warrington
Bridge
before
the
enemy
could
destroy
it
.
<EOS>
the
possession
of
this
bridge
,
he
think
,
would
give
him
both
Manchester
and
Liverpool
,
and
these
important
town
gain
,
the
whole
surround
country
would
flock
to
his
standard
.
<EOS>
in
vain
Lord
Derwentwater
show
him
the
difficulty
he
would
have
to
encounter
,
and
explain
that
the
inhabitant
of
Liverpool
be
decidedly
adverse
to
the
Jacobite
cause
.
<EOS>
a
totally
different
view
be
take
by
Lord
Widdrington
,
who
assure
the
general
he
may
depend
upon
receive
the
support
of
the
High
Church
Tories
of
Manchester
,
and
Mr.
Charles
Beswicke
,
who
have
just
arrive
from
that
town
,
confirm
the
idea
.
<EOS>
General
Forster
,
therefore
,
resolve
to
go
on
,
despite
Lord
Derwentwater
's
opposition
.
<EOS>
several
important
addition
,
as
we
have
just
state
,
have
be
make
to
the
rebel
force
.
<EOS>
amongst
these
be
five
gentleman
belong
to
some
of
the
old
and
most
distinguished
family
in
the
county
,
whose
adhesion
could
not
fail
to
be
serviceable
to
the
cause
.
<EOS>
They
be
Albert

,
John

,
Edward

who
likewise
join
at
Lancaster
,
be
son
of
the
Reverend
Charles
Beswicke
,
rector
of
Radcliffe
.
<EOS>
a
dull
and
gloomy
morning
harmonise
with
the
feeling
of
the
insurgent
as
they
quit
Lancaster
,
but
as
they
advance
on
their
march
the
day
improve
,
and
by
the
time
they
reach
Garstang
it
have
become
quite
fine
.
<EOS>
here
the
infantry
propose
to
halt
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
They
bring
with
them
the
six
piece
of
cannon
seize
on
board
the
Robert
,
and
likewise
some
cask
of
brandy
take
from

<EOS>
at
Garstang
,
Brigadier
Mackintosh
set
free
Christopher
Hopkins
,
who
have
be
hitherto
detain
a
prisoner
,
tell
him
if
he
again
fall
into
his
hand
,
he
would
shoot
him
.
<EOS>
long
before
the
cavalry
reach
Preston
they
come
in
sight
of
the
town
,
delightfully
situate
on
a
ridge
overlook
the
flat
district
they
be
traverse
,
and
the
aspect
of
the
town
be
so
cheerful
,
that
the
spirit
of
the
young
trooper
begin
to
revive
.
<EOS>
They
have
hear
much
of
the
beauty
of
the
lady
,
and
curiosity
to
behold
them
be
suddenly
awaken
in
their
breast
.
<EOS>
Could
they
compare
with
the
lovely
girl
they
have
leave
behind
?
<EOS>
that
be
a
question
which
would
very
soon
be
answer
.
<EOS>
the
young
trooper
now
become
impatient
to
get
to
Preston
,
and
wonder
whether
the
lady
would
come
forth
to
meet
them
as
have
be
the
case
at
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
in
this
respect
they
be
disappoint
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
lady
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
—
none
on
Friargate

—
but
in
the
market

an
agreeable

CHAPTER
<EOS>
IIHow
King
James
be
proclaim
for
the
last
TimeNEXT
morning
,
the
town
,
never
dull
,
present
a
gayer
appearance
than
usual
.
<EOS>
fortunately
,
the
weather
be
propitious
,
and
enable
the
lady
to
come
forth
and
see
the
troop
parade
.
<EOS>
after
this
pretty
sight
,
they
proceed
to
the
Lancaster
road
to
witness
the
entrance
of
the
Highlanders
,
whom
they
be
very
curious
to
see
.
<EOS>
They
laugh
a
great
deal
at
the
strange
dress
of
the
man
,
and
stop
their
ear
to
shut
out
the
shrill
sound
of
the
bagpipe
;
but
,
on
the
whole
,
they
be
pleased
.
<EOS>
as
be
the
case
wherever
he
go
,
Brigadier
Mackintosh
produce
a
strong
effect
upon
the
beholder
.
<EOS>
His
tall
martial
figure
rivet
their
regard
.
<EOS>
on
this
occasion
,
the
rigid
muscle
of
the
grim
old
warrior
's
countenance
be
somewhat
relaxed
,
and
he
even
attempt
to
smile
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
he
be
gratify
by
the
undisguised
admiration
of
the
Preston
beauty
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
fair
spectator
be
best
pleased
by
a
party
of
young
recruit
who
follow
the
Highlanders
.
<EOS>
raw
soldier
they
may
be
,
but
they
be
very
pretty
fellow
,
and
have
plenty
of
spirit
.

rather
below

,
but
remarkably
well

.
<EOS>
never
do
scarlet

,
lace
cock
-
hat
,
flaxen
wig
,
and
all
the
rest
of
their
accoutrement
find
more
graceful
wearer
.
<EOS>
red
and
white
cockade
show
they
be
english
recruit
—
the
Scots
be
distinguish
by
cockade
of
blue
and
white
.
<EOS>
all
carry
musket
,
except
the
captain
,
who
alone
have
a
draw
sword
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
have
be
choose
on
account
of
his
good
look
.
<EOS>
certainly
he
be
the
handsome
,
as
well
as
the
tall
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
the
whole
troop
present
a
very
animated
appearance
,
and
none
of
them
look
fatigue
by
the
march
.
<EOS>
highly
divert
by
the
notice
they
excite
,
they
ogle
the
lady
very
freely
,
and
occasionally
pay
them
a
pass
compliment
.
<EOS>
scarcely
know
what
to
think
of
these
singular
recruit
,
a
crowd
of
young
damsel
follow
them
,
laugh
and
jest
with
them
as
they
march
along
.
<EOS>
on
arrive
at
the
market
-
place
,
where
the
troop
be
assemble
to
proclaim
King
James
,
the
recruit
create
quite
a
sensation
—
especially
among
certain
young
gentleman
in
Lord
Derwentwater
's
regiment
,
who
stare
at
them
in
astonishment
,
and
could
scarcely
believe
their
eye
.
<EOS>
Their
perplexity
afford
the
recruit
great
amusement
,
but
they
pretend
not
to
recognise
them
,
and
do
not
return
their
sign
and
gesture
.
<EOS>
equally
astonished
be
Captain
Shaftoe
when
he
behold
the
troop
;
but
quickly
recover
himself
,
he
ride
up
to
General
Forster
and
obtain
his
permission
to
place
the
recruit
near
the
cross
.
<EOS>
for
this
service
he
receive
the
thank
of
the
handsome
young
captain
,
but
he
do
not
tarry
to
talk
to
him
then
,
or
ask
for
any
explanation
,
for
the
Highlanders
be
gather
around
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
well
than
the
position
thus
gain
by
the
recruit
,
for
they
be
close
to
General
Forster
and
the
english
and
scottish
noble
,
and
could
see
everything
.
<EOS>
what
be
more
,
they
themselves
could
be
see
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
they
be
conspicuous
object
in
the
picture
,
and
really
contribute
to
its
effect
.
<EOS>
station
elsewhere
,
they
would
have
be
lose
,
for
the
place
be
entirely
fill
with
the
military
and
the
townsfolk
.
<EOS>
when
the
proclamation
be
make
such
a
shout
arise
as
have
never
be
hear
in
that
place
before
.
<EOS>
Kerchiefs
be
wave
from
the
window
of
the
town
-
hall
,
which
be
garnish
with
fair
dame
,
and
a
host
of
gentleman
range
in
front
of
the
building
,
make
their
voice
hear
above
the
general
din
.
<EOS>
the
enthusiasm
pervade
all
class
,
and
a
more
exciting
scene
can
not
be
imagine
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
last
time
that
such
shout
be
hear
in
England
.
<EOS>
never
again
be
King
James
proclaim
by
the
insurgent
force
.

at

FORSTER
's
utter
incapacity
as
a
leader
have
now
become
manifest
to
all
.
<EOS>
He
drink
as
hard
during
the
march
,
as
he
have
be
accustom
to
do
at
Bamborough
,
and
after
these
potation
his
head
could
not
be
very
clear
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
have
it
not
be
for
Colonel
Oxburgh
,
who
act
for
him
,
many
ruinous
mistake
must
have
occur
.
<EOS>
remonstrance
,
however
,
be
useless
.
<EOS>
to
argue
with
him
only
make
him
more
determinately
obstinate
.
<EOS>
right
or
wrong
,
he
would
have
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
the
only
person
he
would
listen
to
be
Lord
Widdrington
,
who
know
how
to
humour
him
.
<EOS>
this
state
of
thing
at
head
-
quarter
fill
Lord
Derwentwater
with
the
gravest
apprehension
,
for
he
foresee
that
the
general
's
blundering
and
obstinacy
must
expose
them
to
a
chance
of
defeat
,
whenever
an
engagement
with
the
enemy
should
occur
.
<EOS>
but
Forster
's
indifference
to
the
danger
of
his
position
be
quite
as
remarkable
as
his
stupidity
.
<EOS>
although
inform
on
the
day
after
his
arrival
at
Preston
,
that
General
Wills
be
march
to
Wigan
with
several
regiment
of
dragoon
,
and
some
regiment
of
foot
,
he
refuse
to
believe
the
intelligence
,
and
take
no
pain
to
verify
it
.
<EOS>
neither
do
he
seem
willing
to
credit
the
report
that
General
Carpenter
be
march
against
him
from
Newcastle
.
<EOS>
so
delighted
be
he
with
Preston
,
with
his
quarter
,
with
the
hospitality
of
the
inhabitant
,
and
the
general
attraction
of
the
place
,
that
he
be
in
no
hurry
to
leave
.
<EOS>
like
the
gentleman
trooper
he
have
submit
to
feminine
fascination
,
and
short
as
have
be
his
stay
,
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
,
a
charming
young
widow
,
already
hold
him
in
thrall
.
<EOS>
It
seem
,
indeed
,
to
be
the
design
of
the
Preston
belle
to
captivate
all
the
insurgent
leader
,
and
many
a
tender
glance
be
throw
at
Lord
Derwentwater
by
some
of
the
fair
lady
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
proof
against
all
their
allurement
.
<EOS>
shortly
after
the
proclamation
have
take
place
,
when
the
crowd
disperse
,
and
the
soldier
have
return
to
their
quarter
,
two
lady
,
both
young
,
and
very
handsome
,
well
mount
,
habit
in
elegant
riding
-
dress
,
attend
by
an
elderly
personage
,
who
almost
look
like
a
priest
,
and
follow
by
a
middle-
aged
man
-
servant
and
a
couple
of
groom
,
each
have
a
valise
fasten
to
the
saddle
,
enter
Preston
by
the
avenue
connect
with
the
Lancaster
road
,
and
proceed
to
the
market
-
place
,
where
they
halt
to
make
inquiry
respect
Lord
Derwentwater
's
quarter
,
and
have
ascertain
that
he
occupy
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
's
house
in
Church
-
street
,
they
go
thither
.
<EOS>
these
lady
attract
considerable
attention
as
they
ride
along
,
but
no
one
could
tell
who
they
be
,
until
they
be
recognise
by
some
of
the
gentleman
soldier
,
as
the
Countess
of
Derwentwater
and
Miss
Forster
,
the
general
's
sister
.
<EOS>
It
be
conjecture
that
the
grave
-
looking
personage
who
ride
beside
them
may
be
Father
Norman
,
the
earl

chaplain
,
and
the
old
man

Mr.
Newbiggin

the
butler
at

<EOS>
when

of

it
cause
a
great
sensation
in
the

the

soon
reach
General
Forster

who
chance
to
be
walk
at
the
time
with
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
in
the
Fishergate
.
<EOS>
the
news
do
not
seem
altogether
agreeable
to
him
,
but
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
be
delighted
,
and
say
she
should
be
enchant
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
two
lady
;
whereupon
,
the
complaisant
general
offer
to
introduce
her
to
them
forthwith
,
and
beg
her
to
accompany
him
to
Lord
Derwentwater
's
quarter
,
where
it
be
certain
they
would
be
find

<EOS>
as
the

no

when
he
raise
his
eye

and
beheld
her
stand
beside
him

he
utter
a
cry
of
delight

spring
up

clasp
her

"How

We

just

so
we
rest
there

and
come

day
.
<EOS>
do
not

I

<EOS>
My

be
to
see

<EOS>
leave

<EOS>
there
be
plenty
of
faithful
servant
to
take
care
of
the

what
excellent

you
have
get

if

I

CHAPTER
VIThe

HallTHOUGH
little
time
have
be
allow
for
its
preparation
,
the
ball
at
the
town-
hall
be
really
very
brilliant
.
<EOS>
the
room
be
large
,
but
crowd
to
excess
,
and
space
could
with
difficulty
be
find
for
the
dancer
.
<EOS>
as
the
great
part
of
the
male
guest
be
military
,
their
varied
costume
add
materially
to
the
effect
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
the
leader
of
all
the
english
and
scottish
regiment
be
present
,
and
though
Brigadier
Mackintosh
rarely
appear
at
such
an
assembly
,
his
tall
figure
could
be
descry
amid
the
gay
throng
.
<EOS>
as
a
matter
of
course
,
General
Forster
be
there
—
<EOS>
in
fact
,
he
be
look
upon
as
the
most
important
guest
,
and
the
great
attention
be
pay
him
by
the
master
of
the
ceremony
and
the
steward
,
but
he
seem
entirely
engross
by
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
the
two
lady
who
attract
most
attention
by
their
beauty
and
grace
be
the
Countess
of
Derwentwater
and
Dorothy
Forster
.
<EOS>
both
look
charming
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
come
prepared
for
such
a
ball
,
but
their
dress
be
very
become
.
<EOS>
They
be
attend
by
Lord
Widdrington
,
Charles
Radclyffe
,
and
several
of
the
scottish
noble
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
be
not
very
far
off
,
but
he
be
engage
in
converse
with
Mr.
Townley
,
Mr.
Standish
,
and
Sir
Francis
Anderton
.
<EOS>
at
this
ball
all
the
beauty
of
Preston
be
display
,
and
no
town
in
the
county
—
perhaps
no
town
in
the
kingdom
—
could
have
make
such
a
display
.
<EOS>
the
Preston
lady
have
a
witchery
about
them
that
very
few
of
the
opposite
sex
could
resist
.
<EOS>
wherein
the
charm
consist
we
can
not
say
exactly
—
but
since
most
of
them
have
extremely
fine
eye
,
their
glance
may
have
have
something
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
may
,
the
effect
of
the
fascination
be
manifest
.
<EOS>
all
submit
to
the
influence
—
the
old
campaigner
as
well
as
the
young
recruit
.
<EOS>
every
damsel
appear
to
have
an
admirer
—
some
half
a
dozen
.
<EOS>
whatever
political
opinion
they
have
heretofore
entertain
,
the
lady
be
all
now
staunch
adherent
of
King
James
,
who
could
not
,
they
declare
,
be
better
represent
than
by
his
army
,
and
that
army
must
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
depart
.
<EOS>
so
far
from
desire
to
go
,
the
gallant
young
trooper
declare
they
should
like
to
remain
at
Preston
for
ever
.
<EOS>
at
the
special
request
of
Captain
Shaftoe
,
the
handsome
young
recruit
from
Lancaster
have
be
invite
,
and
they
cause
quite
as
great
a
sensation
as
they
have
do
on
their
arrival
at
the
town
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
difficulty
in
obtain
partner
,
for
all
the
young
lady
be
anxious
to
dance
with
them
,
and
it
must
be
own
that
they
dance
with
remarkable
spirit
and
grace
.
<EOS>
a
cotillon
in
which
they
figure
with
some
of
the
pretty
girl
in
the
room
,
be
the
great
success
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
"Who
<EOS>

those
smart
young
fellow
?
"
inquire
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
,
who
be
look
on
at
the
dance
with
General
Forster
.
<EOS>
"i

"
he
reply
.
<EOS>
"
They

by
Captain
Shaftoe

<EOS>
You

.
<EOS>
""They

charmingly
,
"
observe
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
but
they
look
like
woman
.
<EOS>
""they

be
woman

the
general
.

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
""And

disguise
,
I

very
much
mistaken
,
"
observe
Mrs.
Scarisbrick
.
<EOS>
the
music

strike
up
for
another
dance
the
young
spark
ought
to
have
surrender
their
partner
,
who
be
engage
three
or
four

instead
of
which
they
stand
up
with
them
again
—
a
course
of
proceeding
that
give
great
umbrage
to
the
claimant
;
and
in
a
few
minute
a
disturbance
arise
that
throw
the
whole
room
into
confusion
.
<EOS>
the
Lancaster
recruit
show
great
spirit
,
and
refuse
to
give
up
their
partner
,
defy
the
claimant
to
take
them
.
<EOS>
the
challenge

and
a
struggle

in
the
midst
of
which
scream

and
it
be

that
three
of
the
Lancashire

<EOS>
Their
sex
could

therefore

and
it
then
come
out

as
Mrs.
Scarisbrick

party
of
young

much
merriment

and
Captain
Shaftoe

a
good
deal
of
raillery

General

we
shall
repair
to
Wigan

and
see
what
General
Wills
be
about
.
<EOS>
Wigan
,
a
very
different
town
from
what
it
be
at
present
,
be
fill
with
soldier

<EOS>
besides
Sir
Henry

six
hundred

,
and
three
regiment
of
foot
,
respectively
command
by
Captains
Sabine
,
Fane
,
and
Preston
,
there
be
a
fine
regiment
of
horse
,
command
by
Colonel
Pitt
,
and
five
regiment
of
dragoon
,
command
by
Major
-
General
Wynn
,
Colonels
Honeywood
,
Dormer
,
Munden
,
and
Stanhope
.
<EOS>
whether
Wills
be
an
able
general
may
be
question
,
but
he
be
an
active
and
very
determined
man
.
<EOS>
strongly
build
and
well
make
,
he
have
a
military
bearing
,
and
a
stern
,
inflexible
countenance
.
<EOS>
obstinate
he
be
,
but
his
obstinacy
be
very
different
from
that
of
the
incompetent
Forster
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
turn
from
his
purpose
by
advice
,
but
his
plan
be
carefully
consider
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
constant
communication
with
General
Carpenter
,
but
feel
certain
he
could
defeat
the
rebel
unaide
,
his
great
desire
be
to
attack
them
before
Carpenter
come
up
,
so
that
he
may
gain
all
the
glory
of
the
victory
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
he
hurry
on
his
preparation
—
though
not
unduly
so
.
<EOS>
have
a
secret
correspondent
in
Preston
,
he
know
the
exact
number
of
the
force
,
and
be
also
aware
of
the
utter
incompetency
of
Forster
,
but
he
think
the
chief
command
may
be
take
,
at
the
last
moment
,
by
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
He
have
likewise
some
fear
of
Mackintosh
,
with
whose
valour
and
skill
he
be
well
acquaint
.
<EOS>
still
,
he
feel
sure
of
an
easy
conquest
,
and
be
impatient
to
achieve
it
.
<EOS>
while
General
Wills
be
arrange
his
plan
for
the
attack
,
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
come
into

they
be

He
then
go
forth
with
Sir

in

have
fix

clerical
appearance

he
have
a
brace

and
a

girt
by
his

<EOS>
General
Wills
could
not
help
smile
when
he
behold
him

<EOS>
still
he
perceive
at
a
glance
that
the
parson
would
prove
serviceable

he
therefore
give
him
a

the

the
result
,
however

of
the
impending
contest
seem
scarcely
doubtful

and
the
general
opinion
be
that
the

would
be
effectually
crush

<EOS>
confident
in
their

and
animate
by
their
officer

who
promise
them
an
easy
victory
over
the
insurgent
,
with
the
plunder
of
the
rich
town
of
Preston
,
the
king
's
soldier
be
in
excellent
spirit

<EOS>
nor
do
anything
occur
in

march
to
disquiet
them

<EOS>
the
morning
be
fine
and
the
road
in
tolerably
good
order
,
the
infantry
get
on
very
well
,
and
be
very
little

<EOS>
during
the

,
word
be
bring
to
General

by
a
scout
that
the
bridge

by
Colonel
John
Farquharson

Invercauld

with
a
hundred
pick

<EOS>
General
Forster
have
likewise
come
forth
to

,
and
have
be
see
with
a
party
of
horse
about
two
mile
south
of
the
bridge
,
on
the
Wigan
road
.
<EOS>
this
intelligence
do
not
seem
to
necessitate
any
alteration
in
General
Wills
's
plan
,
but
he
order
Lord
Forrester
and
Captain
Preston
to
halt
at
Walton
-
le
-
Dale
till
he
himself
should
come
up
.
<EOS>
after
this
short
halt
the
march
be
resume
,
and
on
arrive
at
Walton

le-
Dale
,
the
general
learn
that
Colonel
Farquharson
have
be
strengthen
by
three
hundred
man
send
to
support
him
by
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
under
the
impression
that
the
bridge
would
be
stoutly
defend
,
Wills
prepare
to
attack
it
with
Honeywood
's
brigade
,
but
what
be
his
surprise
,
on
arrive
at
the
spot
,
to
find
the
passage
entirely
unoccupied!what
have
become
of
Colonel
Farquharson
and
his
Highlanders
?
<EOS>
where
be
Lord
Derwentwater
's
three
hundred
man
?
<EOS>
not
one
of
them
be
to
be
see
.
<EOS>
though
there
be
nothing
to
impede
his
progress
,
Wills
hesitate
for
a
few
minute
,
suspect
some
stratagem
may
be
intend
.
<EOS>
He
then
ride
boldly
across
the
bridge
,
and
be
follow
by
his
whole
force
,
with
the
exception
of
the
militia
,
which
remain
on
the
south
bank
of
the
river
,
and
take
up
the
position
assign
.
<EOS>
after
cross
the
bridge
will
again
halt
before
enter
the
deep
lane
that
lead
to
the
town
,
and
think
the
hedge
may
be
line
,
he
cause
them
to
be
examine
,
but
no
skirmisher
could
be
discover
.
<EOS>
unable
,
otherwise
,
to
account
for
such
strange
neglect
of
all
precaution
,
he
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
rebel
must
have
abandon
the
town
,
and
commence
a
retreat
to
Scotland
.
<EOS>
Should
this
prove
to
be
the
case
,
it
would
be
a
great
disappointment
to
him
,
as
well
as
to
his
soldiery
,
since
it
would
deprive
him
of
victory
,
and
the
man
of
the
plunder
they
expect
to
obtain
.
<EOS>
however
,
his
alarm
be
quickly
dispel
.
<EOS>
a
prisoner
have
be
take
,
and
be
bring
before
him
.
<EOS>
the
man
have
refuse
to
answer
the
sergeant
who
first
interrogate
him
,
but
as
will
threaten
to
have
him
shoot
,
he
become
more
compliant
.
<EOS>
"where

"In

at

<EOS>
he
add
to
the

<EOS>
"In

the

.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
that
the
only
barrier?""No
,
there
be
three
other
.
<EOS>
all
the
entrance
to
the

be
barricade

<EOS>
""then
<EOS>
the
rebel
mean
to
defend
themselves
?
"
say
Wills
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
the
last
.
<EOS>
You
need
not

<EOS>
""if

so

""I

I
have

<EOS>
now
begone!"the
man
be
then
set
free
,
and
drive
towards
the
town
,
but
he
do
not
re-
enter
it
.
<EOS>
General
Wills
then
quit
the
lane
,
which
be
shut
in
,
as
we
have
say
,
by
high
hedge
,
and
lead
his
troop
to
some
field
on
the
left
that
command
a
full
view
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
how
peaceful
and
beautiful
it
look
!
<EOS>
even
the
stern
Wills
,
who
be
about
to
deliver
it
up
to
fire
and
sword
,
feel
a
certain
regret
at
the
thought
of
destroy
so
pleasant
a
place
.
<EOS>
very
few
evidence
of
preparation
on
the
part
of
the
insurgent
be
visible
,
the
barrier
and
intrenchment
be
all
in
the
interior
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
a
few
soldier
could
be
descry
at
the
outskirt
,
but
no
guard
be
place
at
the
extremity
of
the
avenue
.
<EOS>
will
quite
understand
what
this
mean
,
and
judge
correctly
that
the
house
on
either
side
of
the
street
must
be
fill
with
troop
ready
to
pour
a
murderous
fire
upon
the
assailant
as
they
enter
the
town
.
<EOS>
aware
that
cavalry
could
not
act
within
the
town
,
Wills
give
order
that
two
regiment
of
dragoon
should
dismount
,
when
the
attack
be
make
,
in
order
to
support
the
foot
.
<EOS>
His
first
business
,
however
,
be
to
dispose
his
man
so
as
to
prevent
the
rebel
from
sallye
forth
,
and
cut
off
their
retreat
in
case
they
should
make
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
this
done
,
he
order
two
attack
to
be
make
simultaneously
upon
the
town
;
one
by
Brigadier
Honeywood
from
the
Wigan
road
on
the
south
—
the
other
by
Brigadiers
Dormer
and
Munden
from
the
Lancaster
road
on
the
north
.
<EOS>
His
direction
be
thus
convey
to
Honeywood:"You
will
have
with
you
Preston
's
regiment
of

to
be
command
by
Lord
Forrester
,
likewise
two
hundred
and
fifty
dismount
dragoon
,
command
by
five

<EOS>
these
be
to
support
Preston

.
<EOS>
You
will
sustain
the
whole
with
your
regiment

<EOS>
""your
<EOS>
order
shall
be
obey

general
,
"
reply
Honeywood
.
<EOS>
will
then
give
similar
direction
to
Brigadiers
Dormer
and
Munden
,
tell
them
they
would
have
under
their
joint
command
three
hundred
dismount
dragoon

the
attack
on
the
Lancaster
avenue
,
which
would
be
sustain
by

<EOS>
then
address
the
brigadier
he
added,"Obtain
possession
of
the
end
of
the
town
as
speedily
as
may
be
,
and
set
fire
to
the
house
,
in
order
to
dislodge
the
rebel
,
who
no
doubt
occupy
them
.
<EOS>
next
make
lodgment
for
your
own
man
,
so
as
to
prevent
the
sallying
forth
of
the

upon
them
,
and
check
the
escape
of

enemy

<EOS>
""it

Brigadier
Dormer
.
<EOS>
"before
<EOS>
commence

,
however
,
I
shall
send
a
summon
of

<EOS>
"
but
I
do
not
think
he
will
comply
with
it

<EOS>
"scarcely

place
there
,
and
be
inform
by
Colonel
Farquharson
,
who
command
them
,
that
the
king
's
army
be
certainly
approach
.
<EOS>
still
doubt
,
the
general
ride
on
for
a
few
mile
further
,
when
he
descry
the
vanguard
of
the
enemy
,
and
quickly
turn
back
.
<EOS>
in
the
interval
the
Highlanders
have
leave
the
bridge
,
their
place
be
take
by
three
hundred
of
Lord
Derwentwater
's
man
,
under
the
command
of
Captain
Shaftoe
.
<EOS>
angry
that
this
change
should
have
be
make
without
his
sanction
,
Forster
order
Shaftoe
to
abandon
the
bridge
and
return
to
the
town
.
<EOS>
the
order
be
very
reluctantly
obey
.
<EOS>
Captain
Shaftoe
would
fain
have
proceed
to
Penwortham
to
dislodge
Parson
Woods
,
but
be
not
allow
.
<EOS>
immediately
on
his
return
to
the
town
,
General
Forster
summon
a
council
of
war
,
which
be
attend
by
all
the
english
and
scottish
leader
.
<EOS>
They
be
quite
alive
to
the
danger
of
their
position
,
and
evidently
have
very
little
reliance
either
on
the
judgment
or
skill
of
their
commander
.
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
the
advice
of
Brigadier
Mackintosh
be
urgently
request
by
Lord
Derwentwater
and
other
.
<EOS>
"You
have
great
military
experience
than
any
of
us
,
brigadier
,
"
say
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
what
plan
do
you
suggest?""will
you
follow
out
my
plan
,
if
I
offer
it
?
"
say
the
brigadier
.
<EOS>
"we
<EOS>
will
,
"
reply
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"
if
we
waste
time
in
discussion
,
the
enemy
will
be
upon
us
.
<EOS>
""aweel
,
then
,
"
say
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
useless
to
defend
the
bridge
,
since
the
river
be
fordable
in
many
place
,
nor
do
I
think
it
would
be
safe
to
risk
a
battle
outside
the
town
,
because
the
highlander
have
not
yet
learn
to
face
cavalry
.
<EOS>
nothing
frighten
them
so
much
as
a
charge
of
horse
.
<EOS>
for
this
reason
I
would
have
the
battle
take
place
within
the
town
,
where
the
cavalry
,
of
which
the
enemy
's
force
chiefly
consist
,
will
be
least
serviceable
,
and
where
the
Highlanders
will
fight
well
.
<EOS>
barricade
and
intrenchment
can
be
throw
up
in
different
part
of
the
street
so
as
to
impede
the
advance
of
the
enemy
,
and
a
destructive
fire
can
be
pour
upon
them
from
the
roof
and
window
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"All
<EOS>
approve
of
the
plan
,
except
Forster
,
and
he
be
overrule
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
many
barricade
shall
<EOS>
we
require?—and
where
do
you
propose
to
erect
them
?
"
say
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
"four
will
suffice
,
"
reply
the
brigadier
.
<EOS>
"
in
fact
,
we
have
not
time
to
form
more
.
<EOS>
the
first
shall
be
place
a
little
below
the
church
,
and
as
it
be
likely
to
be
the
chief
object
of
attack
,
I
will
take
the
command
of
it
myself
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
not

it
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
street
,
so
as
to
prevent
the
entrance
of

enemy

"
say
Forster
.
<EOS>
"There
be
so
many
lane
and
avenue
thereabout
that
I
should
require
more
man
than
I
possess
to
defend
the
post
,
"
reply
the
brigadier
.
<EOS>
"
the
second
barrier
will
be
best
place
,
in
my
opinion
,
at
the
back
of
the
house
now
occupy
by
Lord
Derwentwater
,
and
I
would
have
it
command
by
Lord
Charles
Murray

<EOS>
""I
accept

the
gallant
young
nobleman

"The
<EOS>
third
barrier

Lancaster

the

CHAPTER
iiwhat
<EOS>
the
Countess
and
Dorothy
beheld
from
the
summit
of
the
mansionno
position
in
the
town
,
except
,
perhaps
,
the
tower
of
the
church
,
command
so
good
a
view
of
the
proceeding
as
be
obtain
from
the
summit
of
this
lofty
mansion
.
<EOS>
part
of
the
roof
be
flat
,
and
protect
by
a
balustrade
,
and
it
be
here
that
the
countess
and
Dorothy
Forster
be
station
.
<EOS>
They
have
come
there
,
after
witness
the
completion
of
the
barricade
at
which
the
earl
have
assist
,
and
contemplate
the
scene
with
extraordinary
interest
.
<EOS>
from
this
spot
they
could
clearly
distinguish
the
movement
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
They
see
General
Wills
issue
from
the
Wigan
lane
with
his
infantry
and
cavalry
,
and
draw
up
in
the
field
to
survey
the
town
,
and
they
could
not
help
contrast
the
appearance
of
the
king
's
soldier
with
that
of
their
own
undisciplined
troop
.
<EOS>
after
a
time
,
they
see
two
brigade
of
horse
and
dragoon
move
off
towards
the
other
side
of
the
town
,
and
though
these
troop
soon
disappear
,
the
object
of
the
movement
be
clear
.
<EOS>
an
attack
be
about
to
be
make
on
the
Lancaster
avenue
.
<EOS>
nor
could
it
be
doubt
that
a
simultaneous
attack
would
be
make
on
the
south
by
the
force
leave
behind
.
<EOS>
this
conviction
send
a
thrill
of
terror
through
the
breast
of
the
two
lookers-
on
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
reassure
when
they
perceive
that
both
street
be
now
very
strongly
guard
—
that
the
trench
be
complete
and
cannon
mount
on
the
barricade
—
<EOS>
that
not
only
be
troop
thickly
plant
at
the
barrier
,
but
the
roof
and
window
of
all
the
house
be
occupy
by
highlander
and
other
soldier
—
that
the
churchyard
,
which
be
almost
opposite
them
,
be
full
of
troop
—
show
that
if
the
enemy
be
ready
to
make
the
attack
,
their
friend
be
prepare
for
a
gallant
defence
.
<EOS>
nor
be
this
all
.
<EOS>
look
towards
the
Broadway
at
the
back
of
the
garden
,
they
could
descry
the
barricade
command
by
Lord
Charles
Murray
,
and
see
that
it
be
guard
by
a
large
party
of
Highlanders
,
while
the
advanced
guard
of
northumbrian
gentleman
,
command
by
Captain
Wogan
,
could
likewise
be
see
post
at
the
end
of
a
narrow
street
at
the
left
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
all
the
approach
,
so
far
as
discernible
,
seem
well
protect
.
<EOS>
the
access
to
the
market
-
place
from
Church
-
street
be
block
up
by
cavalry
.
<EOS>
nor
could
they
entertain
any
doubt
that
the
preparation
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
be
equally
efficient
.
<EOS>
They
feel
sure
that
the
Lancaster
avenue
would
be
well
guard
by
Colonel
Mackintosh
and
the
Clan
Chattan
.
<EOS>
the
spectacle
thus
present

their
gaze

any
misgiving

I

It

from
its

it

<EOS>
from

post

observation
Captain

could
see
Brigadier

thereupon
Captain
Gordon
give
a
signal
to
the
Earl

who
immediately
put
himself
at
the
head
of

hundred
of
his

hasten
to
Lord
Charles
's
assistance

<EOS>
suddenly
appear
in
the
back
lane

and
flank
the

with
a
close
fire

the
earl
quickly
put
them
to
confusion
and
flight

,
while

the
dragoon
burst
open
the

drive
out
Captain

have

CHAPTER
VIIThe
Windmill
barricadewe
must
now
repair
to
the
Windmill
barricade
,
situate
at
the
end
of
the
Lancaster
road
,
and
command
by
Colonel
Mackintosh
,
kinsman
of
the
brigadier
.
<EOS>
Brigadier
Dormer
with
three
hundred
dismount
dragoon
attempt
to
approach
this
barricade
by
a
narrow
street
or
lane
call
the
Back
Wynd
,
but
they
be
thwart
in
their
design
by
the
vigilant
Highlanders
,
who
screen
by
garden
wall
,
hedge
,
and
ditch
,
kill
nearly
half
their
number
,
and
force
the
rest
to
retreat
.
<EOS>
a
direct
attack
be
then
make
on
the
barricade
,
but
with
no
well
success
.
<EOS>
the
Mackintoshes
prove
themselves
splendid
marksman
.
<EOS>
after
a
third
ineffectual
attack
by
a
back
road
,
during
which
he
again
sustain
considerable
loss
,
Brigadier
Dormer
order
Sergeant
Johnstone
and
Corporal
Marlow
,
with
a
score
of
Stanhope
's
dragoon
,
to
set
on
fire
all
the
house
and
outbuilding
.
<EOS>
while
see
the
order
execute
Brigadier
Dormer
be
shoot
in
the
leg
,
the
sergeant
and
corporal
be
kill
,
and
some
of
the
man
wound
,
but
the
work
of
destruction
proceed
—
and
the
house
and
cottage
be
burn
close
up
to
the
barricade
.
<EOS>
but
nothing
be
gain
.
<EOS>
the
valiant
Highland
chief
and
his
clansman
laugh
at
the
futile
attempt
to
drive
them
from
their
post
.
<EOS>
have
thus
take
a
survey
of
the
defence
of
the
town
,
it
will
be
see
that
they
be
all
intact
,
and
able
to
hold
out
.
<EOS>
but
the
besieger
be
under
the
impression
that
the
insurgent
would
attempt
to
cut
their
way
out
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
the
Lancaster
avenue
be
very
strongly
guard
.
<EOS>
an
express
have
be
send
by
Sir
Henry
Hoghton
to
General
Carpenter
,
who
have
reach
Clitheroe
,
to
inform
him
that
hostility
have
commence
,
and
it
be
therefore
certain
he
would
arrive
next
day
.
<EOS>
Should
this
news
reach
the
rebel
,
it
would
quicken
their
desire
to
escape
,
and
it
behove
the
besieger
to
be
doubly
vigilant
—
especially
on
the
north
side
of
the
town
,
where
the
exit
be
most
likely
to
be
make
.
<EOS>
several
hundred
of
the
king
's
troop
,
as
we
have
state
,
have
be
shoot
down
in
the
ineffectual
attack
on
the
barrier
.
<EOS>
among
the
wound
be
Major
Bland
and
Major
Lawson
,
and
,
as
we
have
just
mention
,
Brigadier
Dormer
be
slightly
hurt
.
<EOS>
Captain
Preston
expire
as
he
be
be
convey
to
the
White
Bull
,
where
all
the
wounded
insurgent
be
take
.
<EOS>
at
this
place
die
Colonel
Brereton
,
Mr.
Clifton
,
and
two
or
three
other
whose
name
be
not
record
.
<EOS>
when
Captain
Peter
Farquharson
,
of
Rochaley
,
whose
leg
have
be
badly
shatter
by
a
bullet
,
be
bring
in
by
half
a
dozen
highlander
,
and
lay
down
on
a
bench
,
he
call
for
brandy
for
the
man
,
and
take
a
glass
himself
,
said:"come

<EOS>
,
here

to
our

even
then
occasional

<EOS>
at
all
the

the
strict
watch
be
keep
to
prevent
surprise
.
<EOS>
the
churchyard
be
still
fill
with
troop
.
<EOS>
a
strange
and
terrible
light
be
afford
by
the
still
burn
house
,
and
as
these
fire
be
not
confine
to
one
quarter
,
but
could
be
see
at
different
point
,
it
appear
as
if
the
whole
town
be
burn
.
<EOS>
the
red
reflection
of
the
fire
in
the
adjacent
street
on
the
tower
and
window
of
the
church
produce
a
very
striking
effect
.
<EOS>
after
awhile
,
Brigadier
Honeywood
cause
the
window
of
the
two
large
mansion
,
just
mention
,
to

illumination
reveal
every
person
in
the
street

and
expose
them
to
the
musketeer
;
but
he
soon
find
this
tell
against
himself
,
for
the
marksman
be
quickly
discover
and
drive
from
their
position
,
while
the
window

break
by
shower
of
bullet
.
<EOS>
in
the
evening
a
council
of
war

at
the
Mitre

but
nothing
be
determine
upon
,
except
that
a
vigilant
watch
should
be
keep
throughout
the
night
,
and
a
determined
defence
maintain
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
General
Forster
take
very
little
part
in
the
discussion
,
and
complain
bitterly
that
Brigadier
Mackintosh
have
disobey
his
order
.
<EOS>
"i
suppose
it
be
through
my
fault
,
general
,
that
the

"
remark
the
brigadier

<EOS>
"undoubtedly

reply
Forster
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
then
,
I
will
repair
my
fault
,
"
say
Mackintosh
;
"
for
as
I
be
a
live
man
,
I
will
demolish
them

them
to
the

Mackintosh

"Let

us

I
pray

"
interpose
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
the
result
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
""so
confident
be
I
of
success
,
"
say
Mackintosh
,
"
that
I
be
about
to
write
to
the
Earl
of
Mar
that
I
expect
to
gain
a
victory
over
General
Wills
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
a
battle
be
imminent
between
his
lordship
and
the
Duke
of
Argyle
,
and
may
possibly
take
place
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
if
so
,
and
success
should
attend
our
arm
both
at
Stirling

Preston

the
Jacobite
cause
must

<EOS>
""Heaven

several

after
a

break
up

some
proceeding

trust
all
will
go
well
to

morrow

"
he
say
;
"
indeed
,
I
do
not
doubt
it
.
<EOS>
still
I
feel
the
great
anxiety
respect
the
countess

<EOS>
""I
do
not
wonder
at
it
,
my
lord
,
"
remark
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
just
as
anxious
about
my
sister
.
<EOS>
Would
we
could
get
them
both
safely
out
of
the
town
—
but
I
fear
it
be
impossible
to
do
so
now
,
since
all
the
avenue
be
guard

<EOS>
""I

insure

Fishergate
barrier

of
which
I

Douglas

<EOS>
"
I
will
conduct
them
to
the
ford

there
I
must
leave
them

<EOS>
""that
will
suffice

"
say
the
earl

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
shall

""And

"At

with

<EOS>
when
they
be
inform
of
the
arrangement
make
for
their
flight
,
the

seem
dissatisfied
rather
than
pleased

the
earl
be
quite
resolve
upon
their
departure
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
be
no
tell
what
the
morrow
may
bring
forth
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
and
if
fortune
should
prove
adverse
,
I
should
bitterly
reproach
myself
for
allow
you
to
remain

<EOS>
go
you
must

<EOS>
"All
arrangement
have
be
make
,
Dorothy
retire
,
and
the
earl

countess

leave
alone
together

<EOS>
for
some
minute
they
both
remain
silent

<EOS>
the
earl
then
spoke:"I
hope
we
may
meet
again
at
Dilston

in

day

"
he

<EOS>
"
but
I
have
great
misgiving

<EOS>
to

will
decide

<EOS>
We
shall
then
either
be
victorious
,
or
utterly
defeat
,
and
prisoner
,
for
we
be
shut
up
in
this
town

<EOS>
in
the
latter
event
I
well
know
what
my
fate
will
be
,
and
I
confess
that
I
can
not
shake
off
a
dread
presentiment
that
it
will
happen

<EOS>
""do
not

We

would

all
would
have

well

<EOS>
but
now
we
must
trust
to
chance

<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
Forster
have
betray
us
,
but
he
have
be
excessively
indiscreet
in

his

CHAPTER
IXThe
FordMIDNIGHT
have
come
.
<EOS>
very
dark
be
the
night
,
and
favourable
to
the
purpose
of
those
who
seek
to
fly
from
the
beleaguered
town
.
<EOS>
the
fire
in
the
burn
house
be
nearly
extinguish
,
but
the
course
of
the
conflagration
could
still
be
trace
by
a
red
glow
along
the
street
.
<EOS>
the
two
large
house
,
now
in
the
hand
of
the
king
's
force
,
be
no
longer
illuminate
,
but
look
sombre
and
threatening
—
the
approach
to
them
in
front
and
at
the
rear
being
strongly
guard
.
<EOS>
the
church
-
tower
could
be
indistinctly
see
in
the
gloom
,
and
a
close
survey
of
the
churchyard
would
have
show
that
it
be
fill
with
troop
who
be
rest
on
their
arm
,
to
be
ready
for
action
at
break
of
day
.
<EOS>
the
barrier
in
this
quarter
be
strongly
guard
by
the
Highlanders
,
many
of
whom
be
lie
on
their
plaid
beside
the
trench
while
their
comrade
keep
watch
.
<EOS>
throughout
the
town
it
be
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
at
the
Windmill
battery
,
where
Wynn
's
and
Pitt
's
regiment
be
post
,
so
as
completely
to
block
up
the
Lancaster
road
,
and
prevent
all
chance
of
escape
in
that
direction
,
the
brave
Clan
Chattan
be
gather
—
most
of
them
lie
on
the
ground
,
but
ready
to
spring
to
their
foot
on
the
slight
alarm
.
<EOS>
the
barrier
command
by
Lord
Charles
Murray
be
likewise
strongly
guard
,
and
by
a
vigilant
force
—
<EOS>
this
be
a
position
expose
to
much
peril
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
Fishergate
barricade
,
it
be
better
watch
by
the
defender
than
by
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
strange
to
say
,
the
outlet
connect
with
this
battery
,
and
which
lead
to
a
lane
communicate
with
a
ford
over
the
Ribble
,
be
not
block
up
like
the
other
avenue
.
<EOS>
three
squadron
of
horse
belong
to
Brigadier
Pitt
be
post
at
interval
in
the
field
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
—
Pitt
's
own
quarter
be
fix
at
a
large
farm
-
house
on
the
rise
of
the
hill
—
but
the
lane
we
have
mention
have
be
leave
unguarded
.
<EOS>
this
unaccountable
piece
of
negligence
have
be
accidentally
discover
by
Captain
Douglas
,
while
reconnoitre
the
road
.
<EOS>
still
,
he
have
not
venture
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
.
<EOS>
Midnight
have
just
toll
,
and
the
besiege
town
present
the
appearance
we
have
endeavour
to
describe
,
when
the
Countess
of
Derwentwater
embrace
her
lord
,
and
with
his
aid
mount
the
steed
that
be
wait
for
her
outside
the
Fishergate
barrier
.
<EOS>
"farewell
,
my
good
beloved
!
"
cry
the
earl
.
"
<EOS>
farewell
!
<EOS>
it
may
be
for
ever
!
<EOS>
To-
morrow
will
decide
my
fate
.
<EOS>
Should
the
bad
happen
,
be
sure
my
last
thought
will
be
of
you
.
<EOS>
""Farewell
,
my
dear
lord
!
<EOS>
"
she
cry
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
say
for
ever
!
<EOS>
for
I
be
certain
we
shall
meet
again!"Dorothy
<EOS>
be
already
on
horseback
,
and
beside
her
be
Charles
Radclyffe
,
who
be
resolve
to
see
them
safely
across
the
ford
.
<EOS>
We
have
already
mention
that
since
Dorothy
's
arrival
in
Preston
,
Charles
have
fall
desperately
in
love
with
her
;
but
owe
to
circumstance
,
they
have
be
little
together
,
and
now
they
be
compel
to
part
.
<EOS>
however
,
they
do
not
despair
of
an
early
meeting
.
<EOS>
in
attendance
on
the
lady
be
Father
Norman
and
Newbiggin
,
both
of
whom
be
well
mount
.
<EOS>
as
the
conductor
of
the
party
,
Captain
Douglas
ride
a
little
in
advance
—
but
the
countess
be
not
far
behind
him
.
<EOS>
almost
instantly
the
party
disappear
in
the
gloom
,
and
then
the
earl
listen
intently
for
any
sound
that
may
tell
how
they
get
on
;
but
nothing
to
occasion
alarm
be
hear
,
after
wait
for
a
few
minute
<EOS>
,
he
retire
—
though
with
a
sad
heart
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
party
proceed
in
the
order
describe
,
and
in
silence
.
<EOS>
if
a
word
be
exchange
by
Charles
Radclyffe
and
Dorothy
,
it
reach
no
other
ear
but
their
own
.
<EOS>
no
interruption
be
offer
as
they
ride
down
the
narrow
lane
,
and
even
a
gate
that
lead
to
a
field
skirt
the
river
seem
leave
purposely
open
.
<EOS>
here
Captain
Douglas
ride
alone
to
reconnoitre
,
but
return
almost
immediately
to
say
that
the
way
be
clear
.
<EOS>
during
his
brief
absence
,
the
countess
cast
a
look
back
at
the
hill
,
and
could
just
distinguish
the
dark
outline
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
here
and
there
,
it
could
be
see
from
the
reflection
that
a
house
be
still
burn
.
<EOS>
as
they
advance
,
a
slight
glimmer
show
that
the
river
be
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
before
descend
the
bank
,
Captain
Douglas
take
hold
of
the
countess
's
bridle
,
and
then
lead
her
horse
cautiously
into
the
water
.
<EOS>
His
example
be
follow
by
Charles
Radclyffe
,
and
the
two
lady
be
soon
cross
the
ford
.
<EOS>
evidently
the
river
be
not
very
deep
at
this
point
,
and
there
seem
nothing
to
occasion
uneasiness
,
when
the
figure
of
a
man
arm
with
a
musket
could
be
suddenly
descry
on
the
opposite
bank
.
<EOS>
as
will
be
surmise
,
this
be
no
other
than
Parson
Woods
of
Chowbent
,
who
have
undertake
to
watch
the
ford
.
<EOS>
"Stop
!
"
he
shout
in
a
loud
voice
,
"
you
can
not
pass
here
.
<EOS>
attempt
to
advance
further
,
and
I
shall
fire
upon
you
.
<EOS>
""look
to
yourself
,
friend
<EOS>
,
"
rejoin
Captain
Douglas
.
<EOS>
"
retire
at
once
,
or
I
will
send
a
bullet
through
your
head
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
draw
a
pistol
he
prepare
to
execute
his
threat
.
<EOS>
"Hold
!
"
say
the
countess
.
"
<EOS>
He
will
let
us
pass
,
when
he
know
we
be
lady
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
know
that
,
"
say
Parson
Woods
.
<EOS>
"
who
be
you?""Make
way
for
the
Countess
of
Derwentwater
and
Miss
Forster
,
"
cry
Captain
Douglas
,
think
to
overawe
him
.
<EOS>
precisely
the
contrary
effect
be
produce
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
do
Parson
Woods
hear
those
important
name
,
than
he
call
to
his
man
who
be
conceal
by
the
bank
behind
him:"Arise
,
and
follow
me

<EOS>
Heaven
have
deliver
into
our
hand

sister

<EOS>
come
with
me
,
I
say
,
that
we
may
prevent
the
flight
of
the
Countess
of
Derwentwater
and
Miss
Forster
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
dash
into
the
river
,
follow
by
his
man
,
and
though
Captain
Douglas
fire
at
him
,
he
be
not
harm
,
but
seize
the
countess
's
bridle
,
and
detain
her
;
while
Dorothy
be
capture
in
like
manner
by
some
of
his
man
,
despite
Charles
Radclyffe
's
resistance
.
<EOS>
what
may
have
ensue
it
be
impossible
to
say
,
since
Captain
Douglas
and
his
companion
be
compel
to
beat
a
hasty
retreat
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
party
of
Pitt
's
dragoon

<EOS>
Father
Norman
and
Newbiggin
offer
no
resistance

be
capture

certainly

of

and
defender

<EOS>
the
Highlanders
be
still
lie
stretch
on
their
plaid
near
the
barricade
;
but
the
great
part
of
the
troop
,
who
do
not
possess
the
hardihood
of
the
Scots
,
have
quit
the
churchyard
,
and
seek
shelter
in
sonic
of
the
adjacent
house
.
<EOS>
no
sign
of
movement
be
visible
in
the
two
large
house
in
possession
of
the
enemy
;
but
the
sentinel
be
at
their
post
,
and
no
doubt
the
man
could
be
summon
instantly
to
arm
.
<EOS>
the
street
present
a
ghastly
sight
—
the
dead
not
have
be
remove
,
and
the
ground
be
cover
with
blood
.
<EOS>
turn
from
this
painful
spectacle
he
survey
the
field
outside
the
town
,
but
could
not
perceive
that
any
change
have
be
make
in
the
disposition
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
a
mist
arise
from
the
marshy
ground
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
river
,
and
partially
conceal
the
militia
station
near
the
bridge
,
but
the
two
squadron
of
Pitt
's
dragoon
could
be
distinguish
in
the
field
.
<EOS>
whatever
may
be
the
design
of
the
enemy
,
it
seem
to
Captain
Gordon
that
no
immediate
attack
be
intend
.
<EOS>
but
while
he
continue
his
survey
,
and
carefully
reconnoitre
the
outskirt
of
the
town
,
he
perceive
some
dismounted
dragoon
creep
along
the
Wigan
lane
towards
the
town
.
<EOS>
watch
them
carefully
for
a
few
minute
,
during
which
it
get
light
,
he
find
their
number
increase
,
and
become
convinced
that
they
be
the
head
of
a
large
party
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
quickly
descend
from
the
tower
,
and
give
the
alarm
to
Brigadier
Mackintosh
,
whom
he
find
at
his
post
,
and
who
order
him
to
proceed
at
once
to
the
Fishergate
barrier
—
the
only
outlet
not
block
up
—
and
take
a
troop
of
horse
and
attack
them
.
<EOS>
Captain
Gordon
instantly
obey
—
nor
be
he

at
the
barrier
in
question
.

stout
borderer

,
be
quickly

<EOS>
a
horse

for
him
,
and
the
party
sally
forth
.
<EOS>
the
Wigan
lane
be
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
,
and
to
reach
it
they
have
to
cross
the
field
on
the
south
side
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
They
get
there
just
as
the
dragoon
have
quit
the
lane
,
but
have
not
form
,
and
immediately
charge
them
—
throw
them
into
confusion
by
the
suddenness
of
the
attack
.
<EOS>
the
conflict
only
last
for
a
few
minute
,
and
end
in
the
complete
rout
of
the
dragoon
,
several
of
whom

kill
,
include
the
captain
.
<EOS>
very
little
loss
be
sustain
by
the
insurgent
.
<EOS>
quite
surprised
with
what
he
have
do
,
and
fear
his
retreat
may
be
cut
off
if
he
attempt
pursuit
,
Captain
Gordon
gallop
back
as
hard
as
he
could
to
the
Fishergate
avenue

<EOS>
He
be
only
just
in

<EOS>
the
encounter
have
be

by
the
two

endeavour
to
intercept
him
,
but
he
and
the
borderer
be
safe
behind
the
barrier
before
either
could

<EOS>
Captain

great
credit
by
this
achievement
,
which
be

of

that
a
very
large
force
,
consist
of
more
than
two
thousand
horse
,
could
be

approach
from

.
<EOS>
no
doubt
could
be
entertain
that
this
force
belong
to
General
Carpenter
,
who
must
have
make
an
early
march
from
Clitheroe
in
order
to
effect
a
junction
with

all
be
now
consternation
among
the
besiege

who
feel
that
some
immediate
step
must
be
take
,
or
they
would
be
shut
in

<EOS>
Colonel
Mackintosh
propose
to
sally
forth
with
his
man
,
and
consult
the
brigadier
,
who
dissuade
him
from
the
attempt
,
declare
it
impracticable
.
<EOS>
as
usual
,
General
Forster
be
completely
undecided
.
<EOS>
half
an
hour
later
,
General
Carpenter

,
and
take
up
a
position
on
the

side
of

make
a
total
of
two
thousand
five
hundred
man

<EOS>
no
wonder
such
an
accession
of
force
should
have
utterly
extinguish
the
hope
of
the
insurgent
.
<EOS>
immediately
on
his
arrival
,
General
Carpenter
ride
up
an
eminence
,
and
be
look
at
the
Windmill
barricade
,
when
a
shot

fall
very
near

I

even
if
I

the
advantage

I
doubt
not
that
I
should
have
be

conclude
the
affair
to

<EOS>
the
rebel

I
be
bind
to
say
,
have
fight
very
bravely
,
and
have
make
a
very
gallant
defence

especially
the
Highlanders

I
have
determine

at

to
take
the

but
I
bow
to
your
experience
,
and
any
suggestion
you
may
offer
shall
be
immediately
adopt
.
<EOS>
before
the
decisive
attack
be
make
,
I
should
wish
you
to
survey
the
town
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
propose
to
do
so
<EOS>
,
"
reply
Carpenter
.
<EOS>
have
post
six
squadron
of
dragoon
under
the
command
of
Colonel
Churchill
to
prevent
any
attempt
at
flight
from
the
Windmill
barricade
,
General

the
south
side

<EOS>
They

attend
by

two
nobleman

on
the
way
they
meet
Sir

party
of

while
General

be
converse
with
Sir

Parson
Woods
and
a
dozen
of
his
man
come
up
from
the
ford
,
with
some
fugitive
insurgent
,
whom
they
have
just
capture
.
<EOS>
learn
from
Woods
that
constant
escape
be
take
place
from
the
Fishergate
avenue
,
General
Carpenter
give
order
that
the
outlet
should
be
effectually
block
up
without
delay

so
as
not
only
to
check
any
further
flight
,
but
prevent
supply
of
provision
from
be
bring
in
.
<EOS>
find
that
the
entrance
to
the
Churchgate
avenue
be
inconveniently
crowd
so
that
the
troop
could
not
act
,
Carpenter
make
a
different
disposition
of
the
troop
;
and
deem
it
probable
that
a
most
determined
attempt
at
escape
may
be
make
from
the
north
of
the
town
,
he
cause
this
outlet
to
be
still
more
strongly
guard
.
<EOS>
when
all
these
order
have
be
execute
,
and
every
outlet
be
block
up

CHAPTER
IIIGeneral
Forster

to
capitulatefrom
his
post
on
the
church
-
tower
,
Captain
Gordon
have
witness
these
proceeding
and
report
them
to
Brigadier
Mackintosh
.
<EOS>
though
not
dishearten
,
the
brave
old
Highlander
feel
that
the
situation
be
one
of
the
utmost
peril
,
and
could
perceive
only
one
way
of
extricate
himself
from
it
,
but
this
he
be
unwilling
to
adopt
,
unless
join
by
his
english
ally
,
and
he
feel
sure
that
Forster
have
not
resolution
enough
for
such
a
course
of
action
.
<EOS>
His
man
,
however
,
could
hardly
be
restrain
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
do
they
discover
that
they
be
pen
up
in
the
town
,
than
they
wish
to
sally
forth
,
sword
in
hand
,
and
cut
their
way
through
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
the
brigadier
tell
them
it
be
too
soon
—
that
they
must
wait
till
night
—
and
if
nothing
happen
in
the
interim
,
he
would
lead
them
forth
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Mackintosh
's
man
be
equally
impatient
,
and
though
they
see
the
squadron
of
dragoon
post
near
the
Lancaster
avenue
,
they
would
have
attempt
to
cut
a
passage
through
them
,
if
allow
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
a
conference
take
place
at
the
Mitre
between
General
Forster
,
the
Earl
of
Derwentwater
,
Lord
Widdrington
,
and
Colonel
Oxburgh
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
now
evident
that
the
town
be
completely
block
up
,
and
could
not
hold
out
long
,
it
be
necessary
that
some
term
of
surrender
should
immediately
be
make
.
<EOS>
Lord
Derwentwater
recommend
that
a
council
of
war
should
be
call
at
once
,
at
which
all
the
scottish
leader
should
assist
,
but
Forster
would
not
accede
to
the
proposition
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
Mackintosh
and
the
rest
be
consult
,
we
shall
never
be
able
to
make
good
term
with
Carpenter
and
Wills
,
"
say
Forster
.
<EOS>
"
let
them
treat
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
""but
<EOS>
it
will
not
be
fair
to
treat
without

the

"
say
Lord
Widdrington

<EOS>
"
Our
estate
I
fear
will
be
confiscate
,
but
we
must
make
an
effort
to
save
our
life

<EOS>
""i
fear
the
attempt
will
be
useless
,
"
say
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"
and
I
would
die
rather
than
do
aught
dishonourable
.
<EOS>
""There
be
nothing
dishonourable
in
what
I
propose
,
"
say
Forster
;
<EOS>
"
but
I
feel
certain
the
Scots
will
never
consent
to
a
surrender
.
<EOS>
""yes
,
they
would
consider
themselves
degrade
by
such
submission
,
"
say
Lord
Derwentwater
.
<EOS>
"If
they
choose
to
throw
away
their
life
<EOS>
they
must
do
so
,
"
say
Lord
Widdrington
.
<EOS>
"
but
do
not
let
us
act
thus
rashly
.
<EOS>
""I
be
acquaint
with
General
Wills

"

Colonel
Oxburgh
,
"
and
if
you
desire
it
,
I
will
propose
a
treaty
to
him

<EOS>

assure
,
I
will
assent
to
no
disgraceful
term

<EOS>
"Lord
Derwentwater
be
still
very
unwilling
that
the
step
should
be
take
without

he

at

to
the

many
of
the

apprehensive
that

sanguinary
conflict

<EOS>
in
the
opinion
of
these

the
Highlanders
would
not
submit
,
but
would
make
a
most
desperate
attempt
to
sally
forth
,
which
would
end
in

extermination

<EOS>
the

insurgent
have
make
up

with

do
not

all
be
settle

once
more

Captain

ascend
the

tower
at
break
of

look
around

<EOS>
the
besieger
have
draw
so
much
near

that
they

likewise
quit

of

have
retire
to
the

anxious
to
snatch
a
few
hour
'
rest
,
and
certain
they
would
be

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
the

could

offer
a
marked
contrast

formidable

feel
that

no

""'tis

idle

by
which
avenue
he
make
his

some
curiosity
at

"The

"
he

;
"
and
though
the

have
succumb
to
Wills

it
may
have
hold
out
for
another
day
—
perhaps
till
now

as
well
as
of
great
personal
attraction
,
resolve
to
make
an
attempt
to
liberate

she
find
a
place
of

,
where
the

till

and
dismiss

vehicle
.
<EOS>
She
be
accompany
by
two
female
attendant
,
and
seem
so
utterly
prostrate
by
grief
,
that
she
need
their
assistance
.
<EOS>
Her
attendant
wear
hood
and
cloak
,
but
not
in
such
a
manner
as
to
appear
like
a

<EOS>
the
earl
be
confine
in
a
distant
fortification
situate
in
the
north
-
west
angle
of
the
inner
ward
,
and
it
seem
certain
that
the
countess
would
never
have
get
there
without
support
.
<EOS>
a
sentinel
be
station
at
the
entrance
of
the
prison
-
lodging
,
but
as
the
party
be
precede
by
a
jailer
they
pass
without
question
.
<EOS>
when
the
massive
door
of
his
prison
-
chamber
be
unlock
,
Lord
Nithsdale
come
forth
from
a
small
inner
room
,
or
cell
,
and
perceive
his
wife
utter
a
cry
,
and
clasp
her
to
his

shortly
afterwards
,
the
jailer

<EOS>
She
tell

and
after
a
very
slight
scrutiny

suffer
her
to

<EOS>
but
this
active
confidante
have
stay
long
enough
to

herself
of
an
additional
dress
with
which
she
be

<EOS>
this

for
the

to

<EOS>
all
be
now
ready

it

to

forth
by

up
in

her

<EOS>
the

stony

by
so
much
grief

<EOS>
He
let
them

and

them
down
the
circular
stone

ivthe

important
escape
must
be
recount
.
<EOS>
in
this
case
the
noble
fugitive
be
indebte
entirely
to
his
own
exertion
for
deliverance
.
<EOS>
the
youth
of
the
Earl
of
Wintoun
be
pass
in
a
manner
that
may
have
give
him
extraordinary
notoriety
in
our
own
time
;
but
though
he
run
away
to
France
,
and
disappear
for
some
year
,
his
claim
to
the
title
be
never
dispute
.
<EOS>
incredible
as
it
may
seem
,
during
this
period
of
his
career
,
he
hire
himself
to
a
blacksmith
,
and
serve
as
a
mere
bellow
-
blower
for
some
year
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
he
acquire
considerable
mechanical
skill
,
which
be
subsequently
improve
,
when
he
abandon
the
hammer
and
the
forge
,
and
his
talent
now
stand
him
in
good
stead
.
<EOS>
He
be
imprison
in
the
upper
part
of
the
Hall
Tower
,
formerly
,
as
its
name
import
,
connect
with
the
old
palace
,
and
the
window
of
his
room
look
into
the
inner
and
outer
ward
.
<EOS>
these
window
be
strongly
grate
,
but
Lord
Wintoun
deride
this
obstacle
to
escape
.
<EOS>
carefully
conceal
about
his
person
,
he
have
a
couple
of
small
file
,
and
set
to
work
with
these
implement
,
he
so
nearly
cut
through
the
bar
,
that
he
could
immediately
remove
them
when
needful
.
<EOS>
the
main
difficulty
be
now
overcome
,
but
the
window
be
at
a
considerable
height
from
the
ground
;
and
,
moreover
,
there
be
sentinel
both
at
the
back
and
front
,
who
must
be
elude
before
an
escape
could
be
effect
.
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Wintoun
,
however
,
be
confident
in
his
own
ability
to
manage
the
matter
,
and
do
not
doubt
he
should
find
an
opportunity
of
get
off
.
<EOS>
the
opportunity
occur
.
<EOS>
during
the
day
a
fog
have
prevail
in
the
City
,
and
of
course
extend
to
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
be
thick
there
than
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
towards
night
the
vapour
increase
in
density
.
<EOS>
not
only
be
the
White
Tower
completely
hide
,
but
all
the
surround
building
be
obscure

<EOS>
the
sentinel
could
scarcely
be
distinguish
on
their
post
.
<EOS>
link
be
light
,
but
only
serve
to
make
the
darkness
more
palpable
.
<EOS>
when
the
fog
first
come
on
,
the
Earl
of
Wintoun
resolve
to
take
advantage
of
the
chance
thus
offer
him
,
but
he
wait
patiently
till
night
.
<EOS>
no
extra
precaution
seem
to
be
take
by
the
jailer
,
except
that
the
entrance
to
the
Hall
Tower
from
the
inner
ward
be
fasten
,
but
this
matter
little
,
since
the
fugitive
propose
to
descend
from
the
window
look
towards
the
outer
ward
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
have
the
jailer
pay
his
last
visit
for
the
night
than
the
earl
remove
the
bar
from
the
window
,
tie
a
couple
of
sheet
together
and
fasten
them
,
and
then
listen
intently
for
the
sound
of
the
sentinel
's
footstep
,
who
be
pace
to
and
fro
beneath
.
<EOS>
so
dark
be
it
that
Lord
Wintoun
could
not
see
the
man
,
but
he
could
hear
him
,
and
when
he
judge
by
the
sound
that
the
sentinel
be
at
the
great
distance
,
he
let
himself
down
as
quickly
and
noiselessly
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
a
sound
reach
the
man
's
ear
,
for
he
suddenly
halt
,
and
call
out
,
"
<EOS>
who
go
there?"but
receive
no
answer
,
and
hear
no
further
noise
,
he
do
not
think
it
needful
to
give
the
alarm
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
Earl
of
Wintoun
,
who
have
remain
perfectly
quiet
at
this
critical
juncture
,
now
steal
to
the
further
side
of
the
ward
,
and
creep
along
the
edge
of
the
wall
till
he
get
within
a
short
distance
of
the
Gate
Tower
.
<EOS>
here
fortune
favour
him

<EOS>
at
the
very
moment

just
come

the

mix
with
the
party
,
and
though
a
link
be
bring
,
he
escape
without
attract
the
warder
's
attention
.
<EOS>
but
another
portal
have
still
to
be
pass
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
bridge
,
and
as
Lord
Wintoun
be
march
towards
it
with
his
companion
,
he
feel
his
arm
grasp
,
while
a
voice
whisper
in
his
ear:"You

for

the

may
have

by
the

at

she

how

invite

They

when

to

some
very
fine
old
brandy

step
into
the
adjoin

to
fetch
the
bottle
.
<EOS>
apparently
he
could
not
find
what
he
seek
,
for
he
do
not
immediately
return
,
and
the
governor
,
feign
to
become
alarmed
,
go
to
look
after
him
.

the
