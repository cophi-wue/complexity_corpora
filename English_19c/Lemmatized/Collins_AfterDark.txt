PREFACE

<EOS>
I
have
take
some
pain
to
string
together
the
various
story
contain
in
this
volume
on
a
single
thread
of
interest
,
<EOS>
which
,
so
far
as
I
know
,
have
at
least
the
merit
of
not
have
be
use
before
.
 
<EOS>
the
page
entitle
"
Leah
's
Diary
"
be
,
however
,
intend
to
fulfill
another
purpose
besides
that
of
serve
as
the
frame
-
work
for
my
collection
of
tale
.
<EOS>
in
this
part
of
the
book
,
and
subsequently
in
the
prologue
to
the
story
,
it
have
be
my
object
to
give
the
reader
one
more
glimpse
at
that
artist
-
life
which
circumstance
have
afford
me
peculiar
opportunity
of
study
,
and
which
I
have
already
try
to
represent
,
under
another
aspect
,
in
my
fiction
,
"
hide
-
and
-
seek
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
time
I
wish
to
ask
some
sympathy
for
the
joy
and
sorrow
of
a
poor
travel
portrait
-
painter
 
present
from
his
wife
's
point
of
view
in
"
Leah
's
Diary
,
"
and
suppose
to
be
briefly
and
simply
narrate
by
himself
in
the
prologue
to
the
story
.
<EOS>
I
have
purposely
keep
these
two
portion
of
the
book
within
certain
limit
;
only
give
,
in
the
one
case
,
as
much
as
the
wife
may
naturally
write
in
her
diary
at
interval
of
household
leisure
;
and
,
in
the
other
,
as
much
as
a
modest
and
sensible
man
would
be
likely
to
say
about
himself
and
about
the
character
he
meet
with
in
his
wandering
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
so
fortunate
as
to
make
my
idea
intelligible
by
this
brief
and
simple
mode
of
treatment
,
and
if
I
have
,
at
the
same
time
,
achieve
the
necessary
object
of
gather
several
separate
story
together
as
neatly
-
fit
part
of
one
complete
whole
,
I
shall
have
succeed
in
a
design
which
I
have
for
some
time
past
be
very
anxious
creditably
to
fulfill
.
 
<EOS>
of
the
tale
themselves
,
take
individually
,
I
have
only
to
say
,
by
way
of
necessary
explanation
,
that
"
the
Lady
of
Glenwith
Grange
"
be
now
offer
to
the
reader
for
the
first
time
;
and
that
the
other
story
have
appear
in
the
column
of
Household
Words
.
<EOS>
My
good
thank
be
due
to
Mr.
Charles
Dickens
for
his
kindness
in
allow
me
to
set
them
in
their
present
frame
-
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
also
gratefully
acknowledge
an
obligation
of
another
kind
to
the
accomplished
artist
,
Mr.
W.
S.
Herrick
,
to
whom
I
be
indebted
for
the
curious
and
interesting
fact
on
which
the
tale
of
"
the
Terribly
Strange
Bed
"
and
"
the
Yellow
Mask
"
be
found
.
 
<EOS>
although
the
statement
may
appear
somewhat
superfluous
to
those
who
know
me
,
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
to
add
,
in
conclusion
,
that
these
story
be
entirely
of
my
own
imagining
,
constructing
,
and
writing
.
<EOS>
the
fact
that
the
event
of
some
of
my
tale
occur
on
foreign
ground
,
and
be
act
out
by
foreign
personage
,
appear
to
have
suggest
in
some
quarter
the
inference
that
the
story
themselves
may
be
of
foreign
origin
.
<EOS>
let
me
,
once
for
all
,
assure
any
reader
who
may
honor
me
with
their
attention
,
that
in
this
,
and
in
all
other
case
,
they
may
depend
on
the
genuineness
of
my
literary
offspring
.
<EOS>
the
little
child
of
my
brain
may
be
weakly
enough
,
and
may
be
sadly
in
want
of
a
help
hand
to
aid
them
in
their
first
attempt
at
walk
on
the
stage
of
this
great
world
;
but
,
at
any
rate
,
they
be
not
borrow
child
.
<EOS>
the
member
of
my
own
literary
family
be
indeed
increase
so
fast
as
to
render
the
very
idea
of
borrow
quite
out
of
the
question
,
and
to
suggest
serious
apprehension
that
I
may
not
have
do
add
to
the
large
book
-
population
,
on
my
own
sole
responsibility
,
even
yet
.

leaves
from
LEAH
's
DIARY
.
  
<EOS>
26th
February
,
1827
.
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
have
just
call
for
the
third
time
to
examine
my
husband
's
eye
.
<EOS>
thank
God
,
there
be
no
fear
at
present
of
my
poor
William
lose
his
sight
,
provide
he
can
be
prevail
on
to
attend
rigidly
to
the
medical
instruction
for
preserve
it
.
<EOS>
these
instruction
,
which
forbid
him
to
exercise
his
profession
for
the
next
six
month
at
least
,
be
,
in
our
case
,
very
hard
to
follow
.
<EOS>
They
will
but
too
probably
sentence
us
to
poverty
,
perhaps
to
actual
want
;
but
they
must
be
bear
resignedly
,
and
even
thankfully
,
see
that
my
husband
's
force
cessation
from
work
will
save
him
from
the
dreadful
affliction
of
loss
of
sight
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
answer
for
my
own
cheerfulness
and
endurance
,
now
that
we
know
the
bad
.
<EOS>
Can
I
answer
for
our
child
also
?
<EOS>
surely
I
can
,
when
there
be
only
two
of
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
sad
confession
to
make
,
but
now
,
for
the
first
time
since
my
marriage
,
I
feel
thankful
that
we
have
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
17th
.
 
<EOS>
a
dread
come
over
me
last
night
,
after
I
have
comfort
William
as
well
as
I
could
about
the
future
,
and
have
hear
him
fall
off
to
sleep
,
that
the
doctor
have
not
tell
us
the
bad
.
<EOS>
medical
man
do
sometimes
deceive
their
patient
,
from
what
have
always
seem
to
me
to
be
misdirect
kindness
of
heart
.
<EOS>
the
mere
suspicion
that
I
have
be
trifle
with
on
the
subject
of
my
husband
's
illness
,
cause
me
such
uneasiness
,
that
I
make
an
excuse
to
get
out
,
and
go
in
secret
to
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
fortunately
,
I
find
him
at
home
,
and
in
three
word
I
confess
to
him
the
object
of
my
visit
.
  
<EOS>
He
smile
,
and
say
I
may
make
myself
easy
;
he
have
tell
us
the
bad
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
that
bad
,
"
I
say
,
to
make
certain
,
"
be
,
that
for
the
next
six
month
my
husband
must
allow
his
eye
to
have
the
most
perfect
repose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
exactly
,
"
the
doctor
answer
.
<EOS>
"
mind
,
I
do
not
say
that
he
may
not
dispense
with
his
green
shade
,
indoor
,
for
an
hour
or
two
at
a
time
,
as
the
inflammation
get
subdue
.
<EOS>
but
I
do
most
positively
repeat
that
he
must
not
employ
his
eye
.
<EOS>
He
must
not
touch
a
brush
or
pencil
;
he
must
not
think
of
take
another
likeness
,
on
any
consideration
<EOS>
whatever
,
for
the
next
six
month
.
<EOS>
His
persisting
in
finish
those
two
portrait
,
at
the
time
when
his
eye
first
begin
to
fail
,
be
the
real
cause
of
all
the
bad
symptom
that
we
have
have
to
combat
ever
since
.
<EOS>
I
warn
him
(
if
you
remember
,
Mrs.
Kerby
?
)
<EOS>
when
he
first
come
to
practice
in
our
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
do
,
sir
,
"
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
but
what
be
a
poor
travel
portrait
-
painter
like
my
husband
,
who
live
by
take
likeness
first
in
one
place
and
then
in
another
,
to
do
?
<EOS>
Our
bread
depend
on
his
use
his
eye
,
at
the
very
time
when
you
warn
him
to
let
them
have
a
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
no
other
resource
?
<EOS>
no
money
but
the
money
Mr.
Kerby
can
get
by
portrait
-
painting
?
"
ask
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
none
,
"
I
answer
,
with
a
sinking
at
my
heart
as
I
think
of
his
bill
for
medical
attendance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
pardon
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
,
color
and
look
a
little
uneasy
,
"
or
,
rather
,
will
you
ascribe
it
to
the
friendly
interest
I
feel
in
you
,
if
I
ask
whether
Mr.
Kerby
realize
a
comfortable
income
by
the
practice
of
his
profession
?
<EOS>
do
not
,
"
he
go
on
anxiously
,
before
I
could
reply
 
"
pray
do
not
think
I
make
this
inquiry
from
a
motive
of
impertinent
curiosity
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
feel
quite
satisfied
that
he
could
have
no
improper
motive
for
ask
the
question
,
and
so
answer
it
at
once
plainly
and
truly
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
husband
make
but
a
small
income
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
famous
London
portrait
-
painter
get
great
price
from
their
sitter
;
but
poor
unknown
artist
,
who
only
travel
about
the
country
,
be
oblige
to
work
hard
and
be
content
with
very
small
gain
.
<EOS>
after
we
have
pay
all
that
we
owe
here
,
I
be
afraid
we
shall
have
little
enough
leave
to
retire
on
,
when
we
take
refuge
in
some
cheap
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
that
case
,
"
say
the
good
doctor
(
I
be
so
glad
and
proud
to
remember
that
I
always
like
him
from
the
first
!
)
,
"
in
that
case
,
do
not
make
yourself
anxious
about
my
bill
when
you
be
think
of
clear
off
your
debt
here
.
<EOS>
I
can
afford
to
wait
till
Mr.
Kerby
's
eye
be
well
again
,
and
I
shall
then
ask
him
for
a
likeness
of
my
little
daughter
.
<EOS>
by
that
arrangement
we
be
sure
to
be
both
quit
,
and
both
perfectly
satisfied
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
considerately
shake
hand
and
bade
me
farewell
before
I
could
say
half
the
grateful
word
to
him
that
be
on
my
lip
.
<EOS>
never
,
never
shall
I
forget
that
he
relieve
me
of
my
two
heavy
anxiety
at
the
most
anxious
time
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
the
merciful
,
warm
-
hearted
man
!
<EOS>
I
could
almost
have
kneel
down
and
kiss
his
doorstep
,
as
I
cross
it
on
my
way
home
.
  
<EOS>
18th
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
not
resolve
,
after
what
happen
yesterday
,
to
look
only
at
the
cheerful
side
of
thing
for
the
future
,
the
event
of
to
-
day
would
have
rob
me
of
all
my
courage
,
at
the
very
outset
of
our
trouble
.
<EOS>
first
,
there
be
the
casting
up
of
our
bill
,
and
the
discovery
,
when
the
amount
of
them
be
balance
against
all
the
money
we
have
save
up
,
that
we
shall
only
have
between
three
and
four
pound
leave
in
the
cash
-
box
,
after
we
have
get
out
of
debt
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
the
sad
necessity
of
write
letter
in
my
husband
's
name
to
the
rich
people
who
be
ready
to
employ
him
,
tell
them
of
the
affliction
that
have
overtake
him
,
and
of
the
impossibility
of
his
execute
their
order
for
portrait
for
the
next
six
month
to
come
.
<EOS>
and
,
lastly
,
there
be
the
heart
-
break
business
for
me
to
go
through
of
give
our
landlord
warning
,
just
as
we
have
get
comfortably
settle
in
our
new
abode
.
<EOS>
if
William
could
only
have
go
on
with
his
work
,
we
may
have
stop
in
this
town
,
and
in
these
clean
,
comfortable
lodging
for
at
least
three
or
four
month
.
<EOS>
We
have
never
have
the
use
of
a
nice
empty
garret
before
,
for
the
child
to
play
in
;
and
I
never
meet
with
any
landlady
so
pleasant
to
deal
with
in
the
kitchen
as
the
landlady
here
.
<EOS>
and
now
we
must
leave
all
this
comfort
and
happiness
,
and
go
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
where
.
<EOS>
William
,
in
his
bitterness
,
say
to
the
workhouse
;
but
that
shall
never
be
,
if
I
have
to
go
out
to
service
to
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
the
darkness
be
come
on
,
and
we
must
save
in
candle
,
or
I
could
write
much
more
.
<EOS>
ah
,
me
!
<EOS>
what
a
day
this
have
be
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
but
<EOS>
one
pleasant
moment
since
it
begin
;
and
that
be
in
the
morning
,
when
I
set
my
little
Emily
to
work
on
a
bead
purse
for
the
kind
doctor
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
My
child
,
young
as
she
be
,
be
wonderfully
neat
-
handed
at
string
bead
;
and
even
a
poor
little
empty
purse
as
a
token
of
our
gratitude
,
be
well
than
nothing
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
19th
.
 
<EOS>
a
visit
from
our
good
friend
 
our
only
friend
here
 
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
after
he
have
examine
William
's
eye
,
and
have
report
that
they
be
get
on
as
well
as
can
be
hope
at
present
,
he
ask
where
we
think
of
go
to
live
?
<EOS>
I
say
in
the
cheap
place
we
could
find
,
and
add
that
I
be
about
to
make
inquiry
in
the
by
-
street
of
the
town
that
very
day
.
<EOS>
"
put
off
those
inquiry
,
"
he
say
,
"
till
you
hear
from
me
again
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
now
to
see
a
patient
at
a
farmhouse
five
mile
off
.
<EOS>
(
You
need
not
look
at
the
child
,
Mrs.
Kerby
,
it
be
nothing
infectious
 
only
a
clumsy
lad
,
who
have
break
his
collarbone
by
a
fall
from
a
horse
.
)
<EOS>
They
receive
lodger
occasionally
at
the
farmhouse
,
and
I
know
no
reason
why
they
should
not
be
willing
to
receive
you
.
<EOS>
if
you
want
to
be
well
housed
and
well
feed
at
a
cheap
rate
,
and
if
you
like
the
society
of
honest
,
hearty
people
,
the
farm
of
Appletreewick
be
the
very
place
for
you
.
<EOS>
do
not
thank
me
till
you
know
whether
I
can
get
you
these
new
lodging
or
not
.
<EOS>
and
in
the
meantime
settle
all
your
business
affair
here
,
so
as
to
be
able
to
move
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
<EOS>
"
with
those
word
the
kind
-
hearted
gentleman
nod
and
go
out
.
<EOS>
pray
heaven
he
may
succeed
at
the
farmhouse
!
<EOS>
We
may
be
sure
of
the
child
's
health
,
at
least
,
if
we
live
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
talk
of
the
child
,
I
must
not
omit
to
record
that
Emily
have
nearly
do
one
end
of
the
bead
purse
already
.
  
<EOS>
20th
.
 
<EOS>
a
note
from
the
doctor
,
who
be
too
busy
to
call
.
<EOS>
such
good
news
!
<EOS>
They
will
give
us
two
bedroom
,
and
board
us
with
the
family
at
Appletreewick
for
seventeen
shilling
a
week
.
<EOS>
by
my
calculation
,
we
shall
have
three
pound
sixteen
shilling
leave

after
pay
what
we
owe
here

<EOS>
that
will
be
enough
,
at
the
outset
,
for
four
week
'
live
at
the
farmhouse
,
with
eight
shilling
to
spare
besides

<EOS>
by
embroidery

work
I
can
easily
make
nine
shilling
more
to
put
to
that
,
and
there
be
a
fifth
week
provide
for
.
<EOS>
surely
,
in
five
week

time
 
consider
the
number
of
thing
I
can
turn
my
hand
to
 
we
may
hit
on
some
plan
for
get
a
little
money
.
<EOS>
this
be
what
I
be
always
tell
my
husband
,
and
what
,
by
dint
of
constantly
repeat
it
,
I
be
get
to
believe
myself
.
<EOS>
William
,
as
be
but
natural
,
poor
fellow
,
do
not
take
so
lighthearted
view
of
the
future
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
He
say
that
the
prospect
of
sit
idle
and
be
keep
by
his
wife
for
month
to
come
,
be
something
more
wretched
and
hopeless
than
word
can
describe
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
raise
his
spirit
by
remind
him
of
his
year
of
honest
hard
work
for
me
and
the
child
,
and
of
the
doctor
's
assurance
that
his
eye
will
get
the
well
,
in
good
time
,
of
their
present
helpless
state
.
<EOS>
but
he
still
sigh
and
murmur
 
be
one
of
the
most
independent
and
high
spirited
of
man
 
about
live
a
burden
on
his
wife
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
answer
,
what
in
my
heart
of
heart
I
feel
,
that
I
take
him
for
Better
and
for
bad
;
that
I
have
have
many
year
of
the
Better
,
and
that
,
even
in
our
present
trouble
,
the
bad
show
no
sign
of
come
yet
!

the

<EOS>
a
busy
day

<EOS>
We
go
to
Appletreewick
to

<EOS>
pay
bill
and

up
.
<EOS>
all
poor
William
's
new
canvas
and
painting

thing
huddle
together
into
a
packing

case

<EOS>
He
look
so
sad
,
sit
silent
with
his
green
shade
on
,
while
his
old
familiar
working
material
be
disappear
around
him
,
as
if
he
and
they
be
never
to
come
together
again
,
that
the
tear
would
start
into
my
eye
,
though
I
be
sure
I
be
not
one
of
the
crying
sort
.
<EOS>
luckily
,
the
green
shade
keep
him
from
see
me
:
and
I
take
good
care
,
though
the
effort
nearly
choke
me
,
that
he
should
not
hear
I
be
cry
,
at
any
rate
.
  
<EOS>
the
bead
purse
be
do
.
<EOS>
how
be
we
to
get
the
steel
ring
and
tassel
for
it
?
<EOS>
I
be
not
justified
now
in
spend
sixpence
unnecessarily
,
even
for
the
good
of
purpose

<EOS>

<EOS>
23d

<EOS>
the
Farm
of
Appletreewick
.
 
<EOS>
too
tired
,
after
our
move
yesterday
,
to
write
a
word
in
my
diary
about
our
journey
to
this
delightful
place
.
<EOS>
but
now
that
we
be
begin
to
get
settle
,
I
can
manage
to
make
up
for
past
omission
.
  
<EOS>
My
first
occupation
on
the
morning
of
the
move
have
,
oddly
enough
,
nothing
to
do
with
our
departure
for
the
farmhouse
.
<EOS>
the
moment
breakfast
be
over
<EOS>
I
begin
the
day
by
make
Emily
as
smart
and
nice
-
looking
as
I
could
,
to
go
to
the
doctor
be
with
the
purse
.
<EOS>
She
have
her
good
silk
frock
on
,
show
the
mending
a
little
in
some
place
,
I
be
afraid
,
and
her
straw
hat
trim
with
my
bonnet
ribbon
.
<EOS>
Her
father
's
neck
-
scarf
,
turn
and
join
so
that
nobody
could
see
it
,
make
a
nice
mantilla
for
her
;
and
away
she
go
to
the
doctor
's
,
with
her
little
,
determined
step
,
and
the
purse
in
her
hand
(
such
a
pretty
hand
that
it
be
hardly
to
be
regret
<EOS>
I
have
no
glove
for
her
)
.
<EOS>
They
be
delight
with
the
purse
 
which
I
ought
to
mention
be
finish
with
some
white
bead
;
we
find
them
in
rummage
among
our
box
,
and
they
make
beautiful
ring
and
tassel
,
contrast
charmingly
with
the
blue
and
red
of
the
rest
of
the
purse
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
and
his
little
girl
be
,
as
I
have
say
,
delight
with
the
present
;
and
they
give
Emily
,
in
return
,
a
workbox
for
herself
,
and
a
box
of
sugar
-
plum
for
her
baby
sister
.
<EOS>
the
child
come
back
all
flush
with
the
pleasure
of
the
visit
,
and
quite
help
to
keep
up
her
father
's
spirit
with
talk
to
him
about
it
.
<EOS>
so
much
for
the
highly
interesting
history
of
the
bead
purse
.
  
<EOS>
toward
the
afternoon
the
light
cart
from
the
farmhouse
come
to
fetch
us
and
our
thing
to
Appletreewick
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
a
warm
spring
day
,
and
I
have
another
pang
to
bear
as
I
see
poor
William
help
into
the
cart
,
look
so
sickly
and
sad
,
with
his
miserable
green
shade
,
in
the
cheerful
sunlight
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
God
only
know
,
Leah
,
how
this
will
succeed
with
us
,
"
he
say
,
as
we
start
;
then
sigh
,
and
fall
silent
again
.
  
<EOS>
just
outside
the
town
the
doctor
meet
us
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
good
luck
go
with
you
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
,
swinge
his
stick
in
his
usual
hasty
way
;
"
I
shall
come
and
see
you
as
soon
as
you
be
all
settle
at
the
farmhouse
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
good
-
by
,
sir
,
"
say
Emily
,
struggle
up
with
all
her
might
among
the
bundle
in
the
bottom
of
the
cart
;
"
good
-
by
,
and
thank
you
again
for
the
work
-
box
and
the
sugar
-
plum
.
<EOS>
"
that
be
my
child
all
over
!
<EOS>
she
never
want
tell
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
kiss
his
hand
,
and
give
another
flourish
with
 
his
stick
.
<EOS>
so
we
part
.
  
<EOS>
how
I
should
have
enjoy
the
drive
if
William
could
only
have
look
,
as
I
do
,
at
the
young
fir
on
the
heath
bend
beneath
the
steady
breeze
;
at
the
shadow
fly
over
the
smooth
field
;
at
the
high
white
cloud
move
on
and
on
,
in
their
grand
airy
procession
over
the
gladsome
blue
sky
!
<EOS>
It
be
a
hilly
road
,
and
I
beg
the
lad
who
drive
us
not
to
press
the
horse
;
so
we
be
nearly
an
hour
,
at
our
slow
rate
of
go
,
before
we
draw
up
at
the
gate
of
Appletreewick
.
  
<EOS>
24th
February
to
2d
March
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
now
be
here
long
enough
to
know
something
of
the
place
and
the
people
.
<EOS>
first
,
as
to
the
place
:
where
the
farmhouse
now
be
,
there
be
once
a
famous
priory
.
<EOS>
the
tower
be
still
stand
,
and
the
great
room
where
the
monk
eat
and
drink
 
use
at
present
as
a
granary
.
<EOS>
the
house
itself
seem
to
have
be
tack
on
to
the
ruin
anyhow
.
<EOS>
no
two
room
in
it
be
on
the
same
level
.
<EOS>
the
child
do
nothing
but
tumble
about
the
passage
,
because
there
always
happen
to
be
a
step
up
or
down
,
just
at
the
dark
part
of
every
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
as
for
staircase
,
there
seem
to
me
to
be
one
for
each
bedroom
.
<EOS>
I
do
nothing
but
lose
my
way
 
and
the
farmer
say
,
drolle
,
that
he
must
have
sign
-
post
put
up
for
me
in
every
corner
of
the
house
from
top
to
bottom
.
<EOS>
on
the
ground
-
floor
,
besides
the
usual
domestic
office
,
we
have
the
good
parlor
 
a
dark
,
airless
,
expensively
furnished
solitude
,
never
invade
by
anybody
;
the
kitchen
,
and
a
kind
of
hall
,
with
a
fireplace
as
big
as
the
drawing
-
room
at
our
town
lodging
.
<EOS>
here
we
live
and
take
our
meal
;
here
the
child
can
racket
about
to
their
heart
'
content
;
here
the
dog
come
lumber
in
,
whenever
they
can
get
loose
;
here
wage
be
pay
,
visitor
be
receive
<EOS>
,
bacon
be
cure
,
cheese
be
taste
,
pipe
be
smoke
,
and
nap
be
take
every
evening
by
the
male
member
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
never
be
such
a
comfortable
,
friendly
dwelling
-
place
devise
as
this
hall
;
I
feel
already
as
if
half
my
life
have
be
pass
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
out
-
of
-
door
,
look
beyond
the
flower
-
garden
,
lawn
,
back
yard
,
pigeon
-
house
,
and
kitchen
-
gardens
<EOS>
,
we
be
surround
by
a
network
of
smooth
grazing
-
field
,
each
shut
off
from
the
other
by
its
neat
hedgerow
and
its
sturdy
gate
.
<EOS>
beyond
the
field
the
hill
seem
to
flow
away
gently
from
us
into
the
far
blue
distance
,
till
they
be
lose
in
the
bright
softness
of
the
sky
.
<EOS>
at
one
point
,
which
we
can
see
from
our
bedroom
window
,
they
dip
suddenly
into
the
plain
,
and
show
,
over
the
rich
marshy
flat
,
a
strip
of
distant
sea
 
<EOS>
a
strip
sometimes
blue
,
sometimes
gray
;
sometimes
,
when
the
sun
set
,
a
streak
of
fire
;
sometimes
,
on
showery
day
,
a
flash
of
silver
light
.
  
<EOS>
the
inhabitant
of
the
farmhouse
have
one
great
and
rare
merit
 
<EOS>
they
be
people
whom
you
can
make
friend
with
at
once
.
<EOS>
between
not
know
them
at
all
,
and
know
them
well
enough
to
shake
hand
at
first
sight
,
there
be
no
ceremonious
interval
or
formal
gradation
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
They
receive
us
,
on
our
arrival
,
exactly
as
if
we
be
old
friend
return
from
some
long
travel
expedition
.
<EOS>
before
we
have
be
ten
minute
in
the
hall
,
William
have
the
easy
chair
and
the
snug
corner
;
the
child
be
eat
bread
-
and
-
jam
on
the
window
-
seat
;
and
I
be
talk
to
the
farmer
's
wife
,
with
the
cat
on
my
lap
,
of
the
time
when
Emily
have
the
measle
.
  
<EOS>
the
family
number
seven
,
exclusive
of
the
indoor
servant
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
first
come
the
farmer
and
his
wife
 
<EOS>
he
be
a
tall
,
sturdy
,
loud
-
voiced
,
active
old
man
 
<EOS>
she
the
easy
,
plump
and
gay
woman
of
sixty
<EOS>
I
ever
meet
with
.
<EOS>
They
have
three
son
and
two
daughter
.
<EOS>
the
two
eld
of
the
young
man
be
employ
on
the
farm
;
the
third
be
a
sailor
,
and
be
make
holiday
-
time
of
it
just
now
at
Appletreewick
.
<EOS>
the
daughter
be
picture
of
health
and
freshness
.
<EOS>
I
have
but
one
complaint
to
make
against
them
 
<EOS>
they
be
begin
to
spoil
the
child
already
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
tranquil
place
,
and
among
these
genial
,
natural
people
,
how
happily
my
time
may
be
pass
,
be
it
not
for
the
saddening
sight
of
William
's
affliction
,
and
the
wear
uncertainty
of
how
we
be
to
provide
for
future
necessity
!
<EOS>
It
be
a
hard
thing
for
my
husband
and
me
,
after
have
have
the
day
make
pleasant
by
kind
word
and
friendly
office
,
to
feel
this
one
anxious
thought
always
force
itself
on
us
at
night
:
<EOS>
Shall
we
have
the
mean
of
stop
in
our
new
home
in
a
month
's
time
?
  
<EOS>
3d
.
 
<EOS>
a
rainy
day
;
the
child
difficult
to
manage
;
William
miserably
despondent
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
influence
me
,
or
perhaps
I
feel
my
little
trouble
with
the
child
more
than
usual
:
<EOS>
but
,
however
it
be
,
I
have
not
be
so
heavy
-
hearted
since
the
day
when
my
husband
first
put
on
the
green
shade
.
<EOS>
a
listless
,
hopeless
sensation
would
steal
over
me
;
but
why
write
about
it
?
<EOS>
well
to
try
and
forget
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
always
to
-
morrow
to
look
to
when
to
-
day
be
at
the
bad
.
  
<EOS>
4th
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
have
prove
worthy
of
the
faith
I
put
in
it
.
<EOS>
Sunshine
again
out
-
of
-
door
;
and
as
clear
and
true
a
reflection
of
it
in
my
own
heart
as
I
can
hope
to
have
just
at
this
time
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
that
month
,
that
one
poor
month
of
respite
!
<EOS>
what
be
we
to
do
at
the
end
of
the
month
?
  
<EOS>
5th
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
my
short
entry
for
yesterday
in
the
afternoon
just
before
tea
-
time
,
little
thinking
of
event
destine
to
happen
with
the
evening
that
would
be
really
worth
chronicle
,
for
the
sake
of
the
excellent
result
to
which
they
be
sure
to
lead
.
<EOS>
My
tendency
be
to
be
too
sanguine
about
everything
,
I
know
;
but
I
be
,
nevertheless
,
firmly
persuade
that
I
can
see
a
new
way
out
of
our
present
difficulty
 
a
way
of
get
money
enough
to
keep
us
all
in
comfort
at
the
farmhouse
until
William
's
eye
be
well
again
.
  
<EOS>
the
new
project
which
be
to
relieve
us
from
all
uncertainty
for
the
next
six
month
actually
originate
with
me
!
<EOS>
It
have
raise
me
many
inch
high
in
my
own
estimation
already
.
<EOS>
if
the
doctor
only
agree
with
my
view
of
the
case
when
he
come
to
-
morrow
,
William
will
allow
himself
to
be
persuade
,
I
know
;
and
then
let
them
say
what
they
please
,
I
will
answer
for
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
how
the
new
idea
first
find
its
way
into
my
head
:
  
<EOS>
We
have
just
do
tea
.
<EOS>
William
,
in
much
well
spirit
than
usual
,
be
talk
with
the
young
sailor
,
who
be
jocosely
call
here
by
the
very
ugly
name
of
"
foul
-
weather
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
farmer
and
his
two
eld
son
be
compose
themselves
on
the
oaken
settle
for
their
usual
nap
.
<EOS>
the
dame
be
knit
,
the
two
girl
be
begin
to
clear
the
tea
-
table
,
and
I
be
darn
the
child
's
sock
.
<EOS>
to
all
appearance
,
this
be
not
a
very
propitious
state
of
thing
for
the
creation
of
new
idea
,
and
yet
my
idea
grow
out
of
it
,
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
talk
with
my
husband
on
various
subject
connect
with
life
in
ship
,
the
young
sailor
begin
give
us
a
description
of
his
hammock
;
tell
us
how
it
be
sling
;
how
it
be
impossible
to
get
into
it
any
other
way
than
"
stern
foremost
"
(
whatever
that
may
mean
)
;
how
the
rolling
of
the
ship
make
it
rock
like
a
cradle
;
and
how
,
on
rough
night
,
it
sometimes
sway
to
and
fro
at
such
a
rate
as
to
bump
bodily
against
the
ship
's
side
and
wake
him
up
with
the
sensation
of
have
just
receive
a
punch
on
the
head
from
a
remarkably
hard
fist
.
<EOS>
hear
all
this
,
I
venture
to
suggest
that
it
must
be
an
immense
relief
to
him
to
sleep
on
shore
in
a
good
,
motionless
,
solid
four
-
post
bed
.
<EOS>
but
,
to
my
surprise
,
he
scoff
at
the
idea
;
say
he
never
sleep
comfortably
out
of
his
hammock
;
declare
that
he
quite
miss
his
occasional
punch
on
the
head
from
the
ship
's
side
;
and
end
by
give
a
most
comical
account
of
all
the
uncomfortable
sensation
he
feel
when
he
sleep
in
a
four
-
post
bed
.
<EOS>
the
odd
nature
of
one
of
the
young
sailor
's
objection
to
sleep
on
shore
remind
my
husband
(
as
indeed
it
do
me
too
)
of
the
terrible
story
of
a
bed
in
a
french
gambling
-
house
,
which
he
once
hear
from
a
gentleman
whose
likeness
he
take
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
laugh
at
me
,
"
say
honest
foul
-
weather
Dick
,
see
William
turn
toward
me
and
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
"
say
my
husband
;
"
that
last
objection
of
yours
to
the
four
-
post
bed
on
shore
seem
by
no
mean
ridiculous
to
me
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
I
once
know
a
gentleman
,
Dick
,
who
practically
realize
your
objection
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
excuse
me
,
sir
,
"
say
Dick
,
after
a
pause
,
and
with
an
appearance
of
great
bewilderment
and
curiosity
;
"
but
could
you
put
"
practically
realize
"
into
plain
English
,
so
that
a
poor
man
like
me
may
have
a
chance
of
understand
you
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
!
"
say
my
husband
,
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
I
once
know
a
gentleman
who
actually
see
and
feel
what
you
say
in
jest
you
be
afraid
of
see
and
feel
whenever
you
sleep
in
a
four
-
post
bed
.
<EOS>
do
you
understand
that
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
foul
-
weather
Dick
understand
it
perfectly
,
and
beg
with
great
eagerness
to
hear
what
the
gentleman
's
adventure
really
be
.
<EOS>
the
dame
,
who
have
be
listen
to
our
talk
,
back
her
son
's
petition
;
the
two
girl
sit
down
expectant
at
the
half
-
clear
tea
-
table
;
even
the
farmer
and
his
drowsy
son
rouse
themselves
lazily
on
the
settle
 
<EOS>
my
husband
see
that
he
stand
fairly
commit
to
the
relation
of
the
story
,
so
he
tell
it
without
more
ado
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
often
hear
him
relate
that
strange
adventure
<EOS>
(
William
be
the
good
teller
of
a
story
I
ever
meet
with
)
to
friend
of
all
rank
in
many
different
part
of
England
,
and
I
never
yet
know
it
fail
of
produce
an
effect
.
<EOS>
the
farmhouse
audience
be
,
I
may
almost
say
,
petrify
by
it
.
<EOS>
I
never
before
see
people
look
so
long
in
the
same
direction
,
and
sit
so
long
in
the
same
attitude
,
as
they
do
.
<EOS>
even
the
servant
steal
away
from
their
work
in
the
kitchen
,
and
,
unrebuked
by
master
or
mistress
,
stand
quite
spell
-
bind
in
the
doorway
to
listen
.
<EOS>
observe
all
this
in
silence
,
while
my
husband
be
go
on
with
his
narrative
,
the
thought
suddenly
flash
across
me
,
"
why
should
William
not
get
a
wide
audience
for
that
story
,
as
well
as
for
other
which
he
have
hear
from
time
to
time
from
his
sitter
,
and
which
he
have
hitherto
only
repeat
in
private
among
a
few
friend
?
<EOS>
People
tell
story
in
book
and
get
money
for
them
.
<EOS>
what
if
we
tell
our
story
in
a
book
?
<EOS>
and
what
if
the
book
sell
?
<EOS>
why
freedom
,
surely
,
from
the
one
great
anxiety
that
be
now
prey
on
us
!
<EOS>
money
enough
to
stop
at
the
farmhouse
till
William
's
eye
be
fit
for
work
again
!
<EOS>
"
I
almost
jump
up
from
my
chair
as
my
thought
go
on
shape
itself
in
this
manner
.
<EOS>
when
great
man
make
wonderful
discovery
,
do
they
feel
sensation
like
mine
,
I
wonder
?
<EOS>
be
Sir
Isaac
Newton
within
an
ace
of
skip
into
the
air
when
he
first
find
out
the
law
of
gravitation
?
<EOS>
do
Friar
Bacon
long
to
dance
when
he
light
the
match
and
hear
the
first
charge
of
gunpowder
in
the
world
go
off
with
a
bang
?
  
<EOS>
I
have
to
put
a
strong
constraint
on
myself
,
or
I
should
have
communicate
all
that
be
pass
in
my
mind
to
William
before
our
friend
at
the
farmhouse
.
<EOS>
but
I
know
it
be
good
to
wait
until
we
be
alone
,
and
I
do
wait
.
<EOS>
what
a
relief
it
be
when
we
all
get
up
at
last
to
say
good
-
night
!
  
<EOS>
the
moment
we
be
in
our
own
room
,
I
could
not
stop
to
take
so
much
as
a
pin
out
of
my
dress
before
I
begin
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
never
hear
you
tell
that
gambling
-
house
adventure
so
well
before
.
<EOS>
what
an
effect
it
have
upon
our
friend
!
<EOS>
what
an
effect
,
indeed
,
it
always
have
wherever
you
tell
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
so
far
he
do
not
seem
to
take
much
notice
.
<EOS>
He
just
nod
,
and
begin
to
pour
out
some
of
the
lotion
in
which
he
always
bathe
his
poor
eye
the
last
thing
at
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
as
for
that
,
William
,
"
I
go
on
,
"
all
your
story
seem
to
interest
people
.
<EOS>
what
a
number
you
have
pick
up
,
first
and
last
,
from
different
sitter
,
in
the
fifteen
year
of
your
practice
as
a
portrait
-
painter
!
<EOS>
have
you
any
idea
<EOS>
how
many
story
you
really
do
know
?
"
  
<EOS>
no
<EOS>
:
he
could
not
undertake
to
say
how
many
just
then
.
<EOS>
He
give
this
answer
in
a
very
indifferent
tone
,
dab
away
all
the
time
at
his
eye
with
the
sponge
and
lotion
.
<EOS>
He
do
it
so
awkwardly
and
roughly
,
as
it
seem
to
me
,
that
I
take
the
sponge
from
him
and
apply
the
lotion
tenderly
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
,
"
say
I
,
"
if
you
turn
over
one
of
your
story
carefully
in
your
mind
<EOS>
beforehand
 
say
the
one
you
tell
to
-
night
,
for
example
 
that
you
could
repeat
it
all
to
me
so
perfectly
and
deliberately
that
I
should
be
able
to
take
it
down
in
writing
from
your
lip
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
yes
:
of
course
he
could
.
<EOS>
but
why
ask
that
question
?
  
<EOS>
"
because
I
should
like
to
have
all
the
story
that
you
have
be
in
the
habit
of
relate
to
our
friend
set
down
fairly
in
writing
,
by
way
of
preserve
them
from
ever
be
forget
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Would
I
bathe
his
left
eye
now
,
because
that
feel
the
hot
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
I
begin
to
forbode
that
his
grow
indifference
to
what
I
be
say
would
soon
end
in
his
fairly
go
to
sleep
before
I
have
develop
my
new
idea
,
unless
I
take
some
mean
forthwith
of
stimulate
his
curiosity
,
or
,
in
other
word
,
of
wake
him
into
a
proper
state
of
astonishment
and
attention
.
<EOS>
"
William
,
"
say
I
,
without
another
syllable
of
preface
,
"
I
have
get
a
new
plan
for
find
all
the
money
we
want
for
our
expense
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
jerk
his
head
up
directly
,
and
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
what
plan
?
  
<EOS>
"
this
:
the
state
of
your
eye
prevent
you
for
the
present
from
follow
your
profession
as
an
artist
,
do
it
not
?
<EOS>
very
well
.
<EOS>
what
be
you
to
do
with
your
idle
time
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
turn
author
!
<EOS>
and
how
be
you
to
get
the
money
we
want
?
<EOS>
by
publish
a
book
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
gracious
,
Leah
!
<EOS>
be
you
out
of
your
sense
?
<EOS>
"
he
exclaim
.
  
<EOS>
I
put
my
arm
<EOS>
round
his
neck
and
sit
down
on
his
knee
(
the
course
I
always
take
when
I
want
to
persuade
him
to
anything
with
as
few
word
as
possible
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
William
,
listen
patiently
to
me
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
an
artist
lie
under
this
great
disadvantage
in
case
of
accident
 
<EOS>
his
talent
be
of
no
service
to
him
unless
he
can
use
his
eye
and
finger
.
<EOS>
an
author
,
on
the
other
hand
,
can
turn
his
talent
to
account
just
as
well
by
mean
of
other
people
's
eye
and
finger
as
by
mean
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
in
your
present
situation
,
therefore
,
you
have
nothing
for
it
,
as
I
say
before
,
but
to
turn
author
.
<EOS>
wait
!
<EOS>
and
hear
me
out
.
<EOS>
the
book
I
want
you
to
make
be
a
book
of
all
your
story
.
<EOS>
You
shall
repeat
them
,
and
I
will
write
them
down
from
your
dictation
.
<EOS>
Our
manuscript
shall
be
print
;
we
will
sell
the
book
to
the
public
,
and
so
support
ourselves
honorably
in
adversity
,
by
do
the
good
we
can
to
interest
and
amuse
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
while
I
be
say
all
this
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
in
a
very
excitable
manner
 
my
husband
look
,
as
our
young
sailor
-
friend
would
phrase
it
,
quite
take
aback
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
always
quick
at
contrive
,
Leah
,
"
he
say
;
"
but
how
in
the
world
come
you
to
think
of
this
plan
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
of
it
while
you
be
tell
them
the
gambling
-
house
adventure
downstairs
,
"
I
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
an
ingenious
idea
,
and
a
bold
idea
,
"
he
go
on
,
thoughtfully
.
"
<EOS>
but
it
be
one
thing
to
tell
a
story
to
a
circle
of
friend
,
and
another
thing
to
put
it
into
a
print
form
for
an
audience
of
stranger
.
<EOS>
consider
,
my
dear
,
that
we
be
neither

use

what
be
call
writing
for
the
press

"
  
<EOS>
"
very
true

I
,

nobody
be
use
to
it
when
they
first
begin
,
and
yet
plenty
of
people
have
try
the
hazardous
literary
experiment
successfully
.
<EOS>
besides
,
in
our
case
,
we
have
the
material
ready
to
our
hand
;
surely
we
can
succeed
in
shape
them
presentably
if
we
aim
at
nothing
but
the
simple
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
to
do
the
eloquent
description
and
the
striking
reflection
,
and
all
that
part
of
it
?

William
,
perplexedly
shake
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
nobody
!
"
<EOS>
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
eloquent
description
and
the
striking
reflection
be
just
the
part
of
a
story

book
that

<EOS>
whatever
we
do

let
us
not

it

so
much

sentence

come

I
continue
,
see
him
begin
to
shake
his
head
again

no
more
objection

William
<EOS>
,
I
be

certain

the
success

endure
them

still

readily
give
the
promise

all
I
want

have
show
that

He
rank
himself
entirely
on

half
do

not
so
much

cry

gayly

set
to

all
think
about
that
.
<EOS>
what
shall
it
be
?
<EOS>
eh
,
Mrs.
Kerby
,
what
shall
it
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
something
may
strike
us
after
we
have
fairly
set
to
work
,
"
my
husband
suggest
.
<EOS>
"
talk
of
work
,
"
he
continue
,
turn
to
me
,
"
how
be
you
to
find
time
,
<EOS>
Leah
,
with
your
nursery
occupation
,
for
write
down
all
the
story
as
I
tell
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
think
of
that
this
morning
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
I
shall
have
but
little
leisure
to
write
from
your
dictation
in
the
day
-
time
.
<EOS>
what
with
dress
and
wash
the
child
,
teach
them
,
give
them
their
meal
,
take
them
out
to
walk
,
and
keep
them
amuse
at
home
 
to
say
nothing
of
sit
sociably
at
work
with
the
dame
and
her
two
girl
in
the
afternoon
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
I
shall
have
few
opportunity
of
do
my
part
of
the
book
between
breakfast
and
tea
-
time
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
child
be
in
bed
,
and
the
farmer
and
his
family
be
read
or
doze
,
I
should
have
at
least
three
unoccupied
hour
to
spare
.
<EOS>
so
,
if
you
do
not
mind
put
off
our
working
-
time
till
after
dark
"
  
"
there
be
the
title
!
<EOS>
"
shout
the
doctor
,
jump
out
of
his
chair
as
if
he
have
be
shoot
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
?
"
cry
I
,
look
all
round
me
in
the
surprise
of
the
moment
,
as
if
I
have
expect
to
see
the
title
magically
inscribe
for
us
on
the
wall
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
your
last
word
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
rejoin
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
You
say
just
now
that
you
would
not
have
leisure
to
write
from
Mr.
Kerby
's
dictation
till
after
dark
.
<EOS>
what
can
we
do
better
than
name
the
book
after
the
time
when
the
book
be
write
?
<EOS>
call
it
boldly
,
after
dark
.
<EOS>
stop
!
<EOS>
before
anybody
say
a
word
for
or
against
it
,
let
us
see
how
the
name
look
on
paper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
open
my
writing
-
desk
in
a
great
flutter
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
select
the
large
sheet
of
paper
and
the
broadest
-
nib
pen
he
could
find
,
and
write
in
majestic
round
-
text
letter
,
with
alternate
thin
and
thick
stroke
beautiful
to
see
,
the
two
cabalistic
word
                       
after
DARK
.
  
<EOS>
We
all
three
lay
our
head
together
over
the
paper
,
and
in
breathless
silence
study
the
effect
of
the
round
-
text
:
<EOS>
William
raise
his
green
shade
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
,
and
actually
disobey
the
doctor
's
order
about
not
use
his
eye
,
in
the
doctor
's
own
presence
!
<EOS>
after
a
good
long
stare
,
we
look
round
solemnly
in
each
other
's
face
and
nod
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
whatever
on
the
subject
after
see
the
round
-
text
.
<EOS>
in
one
happy
moment
the
doctor
have
hit
on
the
right
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
write
the
title
-
page
,
"
say
our
good
friend
,
take
up
his
hat
to
go
.
"
<EOS>
and
now
I
leave
it
to
you
two
to
write
the
book
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
since
then
I
have
mend
four
pen
and
buy
a
quire
of
letter
-
paper
at
the
village
shop
.
<EOS>
William
be
to
ponder
well
over
his
story
in
the
daytime
,
so
as
to
be
quite
ready
for
me
"
after
dark
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
to
commence
our
new
occupation
this
evening
.
<EOS>
My
heart
beat
fast
and
my
eye
moisten
when
I
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
how
many
of
our
dear
interest
depend
upon
the
one
little
beginning
that
we
be
to
make
to
-
night
!
  
<EOS>
PROLOGUE
to
the
first
STORY
.
  
<EOS>
before
I
begin
,
by
the
aid
of
my
wife
's
patient
attention
and
ready
pen
,
to
relate
any
of
the
story
which
I
have
hear
at
various
time
from
person
whose
likeness
I
have
be
employ
to
take
,
it
will
not
be
amiss
if
I
try
to
secure
the
reader
's
interest
in
the
follow
page
,
by
briefly
explain
how
I
become
possessed
of
the
narrative
matter
which
they
contain
.
  
<EOS>
of
myself
I
have
nothing
to
say
,
but
that
I
have
follow
the
profession
of
a
travel
portrait
-
painter
for
the
last
fifteen
year
.
<EOS>
the
pursuit
of
my
calling
have
not
only
lead
me
all
through
England
,
but
have
take
me
twice
to
Scotland
,
and
once
to
Ireland
.
<EOS>
in
move
from
district
to
district
,
I
be
never
guide
beforehand
by
any
settle
plan
.
<EOS>
sometimes
the
letter
of
recommendation
which
I
get
from
person
who
be
satisfied
with
the
work
I
have
do
for
them
determine
the
direction
in
which
I
travel
.
<EOS>
sometimes
I
hear
of
a
new
neighborhood
in
which
there
be
no
resident
artist
of
ability
,
and
remove
thither
on
speculation
.
<EOS>
sometimes
my
friend
among
the
picture
-
dealer
say
a
good
word
on
my
behalf
to
their
rich
customer
,
and
so
pave
the
way
for
me
in
the
large
town
.
<EOS>
sometimes
my
prosperous
and
famous
brother
-
artist
,
hearing
of
small
commission
which
it
be
not
worth
their
while
to
accept
,
mention
my
name
,
and
procure
me
introduction
to
pleasant
country
house
.
<EOS>
thus
I
get
on
,
now
in
one
way
and
now
in
another
,
not
win
a
reputation
or
make
a
fortune
,
but
happy
,
perhaps
,
on
the
whole
,
than
many
man
who
have
get
both
the
one
and
the
other
.
<EOS>
so
,
at
least
,
I
try
to
think
now
,
though
I
start
in
my
youth
with
as
high
an
ambition
as
the
good
of
them
.
<EOS>
thank
God
,
it
be
not
my
business
here
to
speak
of
past
time
and
their
disappointment
.
<EOS>
a
twinge
of
the
old
hopeless
heartache
come
over
me
sometimes
still
,
when
I
think
of
my
student
day
.
  
<EOS>
one
peculiarity
of
my
present
way
of
life
be
,
that
it
bring
me
into
contact
with
all
sort
of
character
.
<EOS>
I
almost
feel
,
by
this
time
,
as
if
I
have
paint
every
civilized
variety
of
the
human
race
.
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
my
experience
of
the
world
,
rough
as
it
have
be
,
have
not
teach
me
to
think
unkindly
of
my
fellow
-
creature
.
<EOS>
I
have
certainly
receive
such
treatment
at
the
hand
of
some
of
my
sitter
as
I
could
not
describe
without
saddening
and
shock
any
kind
-
hearted
reader
;
but
,
take
one
year
and
one
place
with
another
,
I
have
cause
to
remember
with
gratitude
and
respect
 
sometimes
even
with
friendship
and
affection
 
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
numerous
person
who
have
employ
me
.
  
<EOS>
some
of
the
result
of
my
experience
be
curious
in
a
moral
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
for
example
,
I
have
find
woman
almost
uniformly
less
delicate
in
ask
me
about
my
term
,
and
less
generous
in
remunerate
me
for
my
service
,
than
man
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
man
,
within
my
knowledge
,
be
decidedly
vainer
of
their
personal
attraction
,
and
more
vexatiously
anxious
to
have
them
do
full
justice
to
on
canvas
,
than
woman
.
<EOS>
take
both
sex
together
,
I
have
find
young
people
,
for
the
most
part
,
more
gentle
,
more
reasonable
,
and
more
considerate
than
old
.
<EOS>
and
,
sum
up
,
in
a
general
way
,
my
experience
of
different
rank
(
which
extend
,
let
me
premise
,
all
the
way
down
from
peer
to
publican
)
,
I
have
meet
with
most
of
my
formal
and
ungracious
reception
among
rich
people
of
uncertain
social
standing
:
the
high
class
and
the
low
among
my
employer
almost
always
contrive
 
in
widely
different
way
,
of
course
,
to
make
me
feel
at
home
as
soon
as
I
enter
their
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
one
great
obstacle
that
I
have
to
contend
against
in
the
practice
of
my
profession
be
not
,
as
some
person
may
imagine
,
the
difficulty
of
make
my
sitter
keep
their
head
still
while
I
paint
them
,
but
the
difficulty
of
get
them
to
preserve
the
natural
look
and
the
every
-
day
peculiarity
of
dress
and
manner
.
<EOS>
People
will
assume
an
expression
,
will
brush
up
their
hair
,
will
correct
any
little
characteristic
carelessness
in
their
apparel
 
will
,
in
short
,
when
they
want
to
have
their
likeness
take
,
look
as
if
they
be
sit
for
their
picture
.
<EOS>
if
I
paint
them
,
under
these
artificial
circumstance
,
I
fail
of
course
to
present
them
in
their
habitual
aspect
;
and
my
portrait
,
as
a
necessary
consequence
,
disappoint
everybody
,
the
sitter
always
include
.
<EOS>
when
we
wish
to
judge
of
a
man
's
character
by
his
handwriting
,
we
want
his
customary
scrawl
dash
off
with
his
common
workaday
pen
,
not
his
good
small
-
text
,
trace
laboriously
with
the
fine
procurable
crow
-
quill
point
.
<EOS>
so
it
be
with
portrait
-
painting
,
which
be
,
after
all
,
nothing
but
a
right
reading
of
the
external
of
character
recognizably
present
to
the
view
of
other
.
  
<EOS>
experience
,
after
repeat
trial
,
have
prove
to
me
that
the
only
way
of
get
sitter
who
persist
in
assume
a
set
look
to
resume
their
habitual
expression
,
be
to
lead
them
into
talk
about
some
subject
in
which
they
be
greatly
interested
.
<EOS>
if
I
can
only
beguile
them
into
speak
earnestly
,
no
matter
on
what
topic
,
I
be
sure
of
recover
their
natural
expression
;
sure
of
see
all
the
little
precious
everyday
peculiarity
of
the
man
or
woman
peep
out
,
one
after
another
,
quite
unawares
.
<EOS>
the
long
,
maunder
story
about
nothing
,
the
wearisome
recital
of
petty
grievance
,
the
local
anecdote
unrelieve
by
the
faint
suspicion
of
anything
like
general
interest
,
which
I
have
be
condemn
to
hear
,
as
a
consequence
of
thaw
the
ice
off
the
feature
of
formal
sitter
by
the
method
just
describe
,
would
fill
hundred
of
volume
,
and
promote
the
repose
of
thousand
of
reader
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
if
I
have
suffer
under
the
tediousness
of
the
many
,
I
have
not
be
without
my
compensating
gain
from
the
wisdom
and
experience
of
the
few
.
<EOS>
to
some
of
my
sitter
I
have
be
indebte
for
information
which
have
enlarge
my
mind
 
to
some
for
advice
which
have
lighten
my
heart
 
to
some
for
narrative
of
strange
adventure
which
rivet
my
attention
at
the
time
,
which
have
serve
to
interest
and
amuse
my
fireside
circle
for
many
year
past
,
and
which
be
now
,
<EOS>
I
would
fain
hope
,
destine
to
make
kind
friend
for
me
among
a
wide
audience
than
any
that
I
have
yet
address
.
  
<EOS>
singularly
enough
,
almost
all
the
good
story
that
I
have
hear
from
my
sitter
have
be
tell
by
accident
.
<EOS>
I
only
remember
two
case
in
which
a
story
be
volunteer
to
me
,
and
,
although
I
have
often
try
the
experiment
,
I
can
not
call
to
mind
even
a
single
instance
in
which
lead
question
(
as
the
lawyer
call
them
)
on
my
part
,
address
to
a
sitter
,
ever
produce
any
result
worth
recording
.
<EOS>
over
and
over
again
,
I
have
be
disastrously
successful
in
encourage
dull
people
to
weary
me
.
<EOS>
but
the
clever
people
who
have
something
interesting
to
say
,
seem
,
so
far
as
I
have
observe
them
,
to
acknowledge
no
other
stimulant
than
chance
.
<EOS>
for
every
story
which
I
propose
include
in
the
present
collection
,
except
one
,
I
have
be
indebte
,
in
the
first
instance
,
to
the
capricious
influence
of
the
same
chance
.
<EOS>
something
my
sitter
have
see
about
me
,
something
I
have
remark
in
my
sitter
,
or
in
the
room
in
which
I
take
the
likeness
,
or
in
the
neighborhood
through
which
I
pass
on
my
way
to
work
,
have
suggest
the
necessary
association
,
or
have
start
the
right
train
of
recollection
,
and
then
the
story
appear
to
begin
of
its
own
accord
.
<EOS>
occasionally
the
most
casual
notice
,
on
my
part
,
of
some
very
unpromising
object
have
smooth
the
way
for
the
relation
of
a
long
and
interesting
narrative
.
<EOS>
I
first
hear
one
of
the
most
dramatic
of
the
story
that
will
be
present
in
this
book
,
merely
through
be
carelessly
inquisitive
to
know
the
history
of
a
stuff
poodle
-
dog
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
thus
not
without
reason
that
I
lie
some
stress
on
the
desirableness
of
preface
each
one
of
the
follow
narrative
by
a
brief
account
of
the
curious
manner
in
which
I
become
possessed
of
it
.
<EOS>
as
to
my
capacity
for
repeat
these
story
correctly
,
I
can
answer
for
it
that
my
memory
may
be
trust
.
<EOS>
I
may
claim
it
as
a
merit
,
because
it
be
after
all
a
mechanical
one
,
that
I
forget
nothing
,
and
that
I
can
call
long
-
pass
conversation
and
event
as
readily
to
my
recollection
as
if
they
have
happen
but
a
few
week
ago
.
<EOS>
of
two
thing
at
least
I
feel
tolerably
certain
beforehand
,
in
meditate
over
the
content
of
this
book
:
<EOS>
first
,
that
I
can
repeat
correctly
all
that
I
have
hear
;
and
,
secondly
,
that
I
have
never
miss
anything
worth
hearing
when
my
sitter
be
address
me
on
an
interesting
subject
.
<EOS>
although
I
can
not
take
the
lead
in
talk
while
I
be
engage
in
painting
,
I
can
listen
while
other
speak
,
and
work
all
the
well
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
so
much
in
the
way
of
general
preface
to
the
page
for
which
I
be
about
to
ask
the
reader
's
attention
.
<EOS>
let
me
now
advance
to
particular
,
and
describe
how
I
come
to
hear
the
first
story
in
the
present
collection
.
<EOS>
I
begin
with
it
because
it
be
the
story
that
I
have
oftenest
"
rehearse
,
"
to
borrow
a
phrase
from
the
stage
.
<EOS>
wherever
I
go
,
I
be
sooner
or
later
sure
to
tell
it
.
<EOS>
only
last
night
,
I
be
persuade
into
repeat
it
once
more
by
the
inhabitant
of
the
farmhouse
in
which
I
be
now
stay
.
  
<EOS>
not
many
year
ago
,
on
return
from
a
short
holiday
visit
to
a
friend
settle
in
Paris
,
I
find
professional
letter
await
me
at
my
agent
be
in
London
,
which
require
my
immediate
presence
in
Liverpool

<EOS>
without

to
unpack

I
proceed
by
the
first

and
,
call

<EOS>
I
be

in
high
spirit
,
and
be
just
leave
the
picture
-
dealer
's
shop
to
look
out
for
comfortable
lodging
,
when
I
be
meet
at
the
door
by
the
landlord
of
one
of
the
large
hotel
in
Liverpool
 
an
old
acquaintance
whom
I
have
know
as
manager
of
a
tavern
in
London
in
my
student
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Kerby

"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
,
in
great
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
an
unexpected
meeting
!
<EOS>
the
last
man
in
the
world
whom
I
expect
to
see
,
and
yet
the
very
man
whose
service
I
want
to
make
use
of
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
,
more
work
for
me
?
<EOS>
"
say
I
;
"
be
all
the
people
in
Liverpool
go
to
have
their
portrait
paint
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
know
of
one
,
"
reply
the
landlord
,
"
a
gentleman
stay
at
my
hotel
,
who
want
a
chalk
drawing
do
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
on
my
way
here
to
inquire
of
any
artist
whom
our
picture
-
deal
friend
could
recommend
.
<EOS>
how
glad
I
be
that
I
meet
you
before
I
have
commit
myself
to
employ
a
stranger
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
this
likeness
want
at
once
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
think
of
the
number
of
engagement
that
I
have
already
get
in
my
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
immediately
 
to
-
day
 
this
very
hour
,
if
possible
,
"
say
the
landlord
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Faulkner
,
the
gentleman
I
be
speak
of
,
be
to
have
sail
yesterday
for
the
Brazils
from
this
place
;
but
the
wind
shift
last
night
to
the
wrong
quarter
,
and
he
come
ashore
again
this
morning
.
<EOS>
He
may
of
course
be
detain
here
for
some
time
;
but
he
may
also
be
call
on
board
ship
at
half
an
hour
's
notice
,
if
the
wind
shift
back
again
in
the
right
direction
.
<EOS>
this
uncertainty
make
it
a
matter
of
importance
that
the
likeness
should
be
begin
immediately
.
<EOS>
undertake
it
if
you
possibly
can
,
for
Mr.
Faulkner
's
a
liberal
gentleman
,
who
be
sure
to
give
you
your
own
term
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
reflect
for
a
minute
or
two
.
<EOS>
the
portrait
be
only
want
in
chalk
,
and
would
not
take
long
;
besides
,
I
may
finish
it
in
the
evening
,
if
my
other
engagement
press
hard
upon
me
in
the
daytime
.
<EOS>
why
not
leave
my
luggage
at
the
picture
-
dealer
's
,
put
off
look
for
lodging
till
night
,
and
secure
the
new
commission
boldly
by
go
back
at
once
with
the
landlord
to
the
hotel
?
<EOS>
I
decide
on
follow
this
course
almost
as
soon
as
the
idea
occur
to
me
 
put
my
chalk
in
my
pocket
,
and
a
sheet
of
draw
paper
in
the
first
of
my
portfolio
that
come
to
hand
 
<EOS>
and
so
present
myself
before
Mr.
Faulkner
,
ready
to
take
his
likeness
,
literally
at
five
minute
'
notice
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
him
a
very
pleasant
,
intelligent
man
,
young
and
handsome
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
a
great
traveler
;
have
visit
all
the
wonder
of
the
East
;
and
be
now
about
to
explore
the
wild
of
the
vast
South
American
Continent
.
<EOS>
thus
much
he
tell
me
good
-
humoredly
and
unconstrainedly
while
I
be
prepare
my
drawing
material
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
have
put
him
in
the
right
light
and
position
,
and
have
seat
myself
opposite
to
him
,
he
change
the
subject
of
conversation
,
and
ask
me
,
a
little
confusedly
as
I
think
,
if
it
be
not
a
customary
practice
among
portrait
-
painter
to
gloss
over
the
fault
in
their
sitter
'
face
,
and
to
make
as
much
as
possible
of
any
good
point
which
their
feature
may
possess
.
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
"
I
answer
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
describe
the
whole
art
and
mystery
of
successful
portrait
-
painting
in
a
few
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
beg
,
then
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
you
will
depart
from
the
usual
practice
in
my
case
,
and
draw
me
with
all
my
defect
,
exactly
as
I
be
?
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
"
he
go
on
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
"
the
likeness
you
be
now
prepare
to
take
be
intend
for
my
mother
.
<EOS>
My
rove
disposition
make
me
a
great
anxiety
to
her
,
and
she
part
from
me
this
last
time
very
sadly
and
unwillingly
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
the
idea
come
into
my
head
,
but
it
strike
me
this
morning
that
I
could
not
better
employ
the
time
,
while
I
be
delay
here
on
shore
,
than
by
get
my
likeness
do
to
send
to
her
as
a
keepsake
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
portrait
of
me
since
I
be
a
child
,
and
she
be
sure
to
value
a
drawing
of
me
more
than
anything
else
I
could
send
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
only
trouble
you
with
this
explanation
to
prove
that
I
be
really
sincere
in
my
wish
to
be
draw
unflatteringly
,
exactly
as
I
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
secretly
respect
and
admire
him
for
what
he
have
just
say
,
I
promise
that
his
direction
should
be
implicitly
follow
,
and
begin
to
work
immediately
.
<EOS>
before
I
have
pursue
my
occupation
for
ten
minute
,
the
conversation
begin
to
flag
,
and
the
usual
obstacle
to
my
success
with
a
sitter
gradually
set
itself
up
between
us
.
<EOS>
quite
unconsciously
,
of
course
,
Mr.
Faulkner
stiffen
his
neck
,
shut
his
month
,
and
contract
his
eyebrow
 
evidently
under
the
impression
that
he
be
facilitate
the
process
of
take
his
portrait
by
make
his
face
as
like
a
lifeless
mask
as
possible
.
<EOS>
all
trace
of
his
natural
animate
expression
be
fast
disappearing
,
and
he
be
begin
to
change
into
a
heavy
and
rather
melancholy
-
looking
man
.
  
<EOS>
this
complete
alteration
be
of
no
great
consequence
so
long
as
I
be
only
engage
in
draw
the
outline
of
his
face
and
the
general
form
of
his
feature
.
<EOS>
I
accordingly
work
on
doggedly
for
more
than
an
hour
 
then
leave
off
to
point
my
chalk
again
,
and
to
give
my
sitter
a
few
minute
'
rest
.
<EOS>
thus
far
the
likeness
have
not
suffer
through
Mr.
Faulkner
's
unfortunate
notion
of
the
right
way
of
sit
for
his
portrait
;
but
the
time
of
difficulty
,
as
I
well
know
,
be
to
come
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
me
to
think
of
put
any
expression
into
the
drawing
unless
I
could
contrive
some
mean
,
when
he
resume
his
chair
,
of
make
him
look
like
himself
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
talk
to
him
about
foreign
part
,
"
think
I
,
"
and
try
if
I
can
not
make
him
forget
that
he
be
sit
for
his
picture
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
while
I
be
point
my
chalk
Mr.
Faulkner
be
walk
up
and
down
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
chance
to
see
the
portfolio
I
have
bring
with
me
lean
against
the
wall
,
and
ask
if
there
be
any
sketch
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
there
be
a
few
which
I
have
make
during
my
recent
stay
in
Paris
;
"
in
Paris
?
"
<EOS>
he
repeat
,
with
a
look
of
interest
;
"
may
I
see
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
give
him
the
permission
he
ask
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
sit
down
,
he
take
the
portfolio
on
his
knee
,
and
begin
to
look
through
it
.
<EOS>
He
turn
over
the
first
five
sketch
rapidly
enough
;
but
when
he
come
to
the
sixth
,
I
see
his
face
flush
directly
,
and
observe
that
he
take
the
drawing
out
of
the
portfolio
,
carry
it
to
the
window
,
and
remain
silently
absorb
in
the
contemplation
of
it
for
full
five
minute
.
<EOS>
after
that
,
he
turn
round
to
me
,
and
ask
very
anxiously
if
I
have
any
objection
to
part
with
that
sketch
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
least
interesting
drawing
of
the
collection
 
merely
a
view
in
one
of
the
street
run
by
the
back
of
the
house
in
the
Palais
Royal
.
<EOS>
some
four
or
five
of
these
house
be
comprise
in
the
view
,
which
be
of
no
particular
use
to
me
in
any
way
;
and
which
be
too
valueless
,
as
a
work
of
art
,
for
me
to
think
of
sell
it
.
<EOS>
I
beg
his
acceptance
of
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
He
thank
me
quite
warmly
;
and
then
,
see
that
I
look
a
little
surprised
at
the
odd
selection
he
have
make
from
my
sketch
<EOS>
,
laughingly
ask
me
if
I
could
guess
why
he
have
be
so
anxious
to
become
possess
of
the
view
which
I
have
give
him
?
  
<EOS>
"
probably
,
"
I
answer
,
"
there
be
some
remarkable
historical
association
connect
with
that
street
at
the
back
of
the
Palais
Royal
,
of
which
I
be
ignorant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Mr.
Faulkner
;
"
at
least
none
that
I
know
of
.
<EOS>
the
only
association
connect
with
the
place
in
my
mind
be
a
purely
personal
association
.
<EOS>
look
at
this
house
in
your
drawing
 
the
house
with
the
water
-
pipe
run
down
it
from
top
to
bottom
.
<EOS>
I
once
pass
a
night
there
 
a
night
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
to
the
day
of
my
death
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
some
awkward
travel
adventure
in
my
time
;
but
that
adventure
!
<EOS>
well
,
never
mind
,
suppose
we
begin
the
sitting
.
<EOS>
I
make
but
a
bad
return
for
your
kindness
in
give
me
the
sketch
by
thus
waste
your
time
in
mere
talk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
come
!
come
!
"
<EOS>
think
I
,
as
he
go
back
to
the
sitter
's
chair
,
"
I
shall
see
your
natural
expression
on
your
face
if
I
can
only
get
you
to
talk
about
that
adventure
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
easy
enough
to
lead
him
in
the
right
direction
.
<EOS>
at
the
first
hint
from
me
,
he
return
to
the
subject
of
the
house
in
the
back
street
.
<EOS>
without
,
I
hope
,
show
any
undue
curiosity
,
I
contrive
to
let
him
see
that
I
feel
a
deep
interest
in
everything
he
now
say
.
<EOS>
after
two
or
three
preliminary
hesitation
,
he
at
last
,
to
my
great
joy
,
fairly
start
on
the
narrative
of
his
adventure
.
<EOS>
in
the
interest
of
his
subject
he
soon
completely
forget
that
he
be
sit
for
his
portrait
 
the
very
expression
that
I
want
come
over
his
face
 
and
my
drawing
proceed
toward
completion
,
in
the
right
direction
,
and
to
the
good
purpose
.
<EOS>
at
every
fresh
touch
I
feel
more
and
more
certain
that
I
be
now
get
the
well
of
my
grand
difficulty
;
and
I
enjoy
the
additional
gratification
of
have
my
work
lighten
by
the
recital
of
a
true
story
,
which
possess
,
in
my
estimation
,
all
the
excitement
of
the
most
exciting
romance
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
as
I
recollect
it
,
be
how
Mr.
Faulkner
tell
me
his
adventure
:
  
<EOS>
the
traveler
'S
STORY
  
of
  
a
terribly
strange
bed
.
  
<EOS>
shortly
after
my
education
at
college
be
finish
,
I
happen
to
be
stay
at
Paris
with
an
english
friend
.
<EOS>
We
be
both
young
man
then
,
and
live
,
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
,
rather
a
wild
life
,
in
the
delightful
city
of
our
sojourn
.
<EOS>
one
night
we
be
idle
about
the
neighborhood
of
the
Palais
Royal
,
doubtful
to
what
amusement
<EOS>
we
should
next
betake
ourselves
.
<EOS>
My
friend
propose
a
visit
to
Frascati
's
;
but
his
suggestion
be
not
to
my
taste
.
<EOS>
I
know
Frascati
's
,
as
the
French
saying
be
,
by
heart
;
have
lose
and
win
plenty
of
five
-
franc
piece
there
,
merely
for
amusement
's
sake
,
until
it
be
amusement
no
longer
,
and
be
thoroughly
tired
,
in
fact
,
of
all
the
ghastly
respectability
of
such
a
social
anomaly
as
a
respectable
gambling
-
house
.
"
<EOS>
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
"
say
I
to
my
friend
,
"
let
us
go
somewhere
where
we
can
see
a
little
genuine
,
blackguard
,
poverty
-
stricken
gaming
with
no
false
gingerbread
glitter
throw
over
it
all
.
<EOS>
let
us
get
away
from
fashionable
Frascati
's
,
to
a
house
where
they
do
not
mind
let
in
a
man
with
a
ragged
coat
,
or
a
man
with
no
coat
,
ragged
or
otherwise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
say
my
friend
,
"
we
need
not
go
out
of
the
Palais
Royal
to
find
the
sort
of
company
you
want
.
<EOS>
here
be
the
place
just
before
us
;
as
blackguard
a
place
,
by
all
report
,
as
you
could
possibly
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
"
in
another
minute
we
arrive
at
the
door
,
and
enter
the
house
,
the
back
of
which
you
have
draw
in
your
sketch
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
get
upstairs
,
and
have
leave
our
hat
and
stick
with
the
doorkeeper
,
we
be
admit
into
the
chief
gambling
-
room
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
find
many
people
assemble
there
.
<EOS>
but
,
few
as
the
man
be
who
look
up
at
us
on
our
entrance
,
they
be
all
type
 
<EOS>
lamentably
true
type
 
of
their
respective
class
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
come
to
see
blackguard
;
but
these
man
be
something
bad
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
comic
side
,
more
or
less
appreciable
,
in
all
blackguardism
 
<EOS>
here
there
be
nothing
but
tragedy
 
mute
,
weird
tragedy
.
<EOS>
the
quiet
in
the
room
be
horrible
.
<EOS>
the
thin
,
haggard
,
long
-
haired
young
man
,
whose
sink
eye
fiercely
watch
the
turning
up
of
the
card
,
never
speak
;
the
flabby
,
fat
-
faced
,
pimply
player
,
who
prick
his
piece
of
pasteboard
perseveringly
,
to
register
how
often
black
won
,
and
how
often
red
 
never
speak

the
dirty

wrinkle
old
man

with
the
vulture
eye

who
have
lose

and
still
look
on
desperately
,
after
he
could
play
no
longer
 
never
speak
.
<EOS>
even
the
voice
of
the
croupier
sound
as
if
it
be
strangely
dull
and
thicken
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
I
have
enter
the
place
to
laugh
,
but
the
spectacle
before
me
be
something
to
weep
over
.
<EOS>
I
soon
find
it
necessary
to
take
refuge
in
excitement
from
the
depression
of
spirit
which
be
fast
steal
on
me
.
<EOS>
unfortunately
I
seek
the
near
excitement
,
by
go
to
the
table
and
beginning
to
play
.
<EOS>
still
more
unfortunately
,
as
the
event
will
show
,
I
win
 
win
prodigiously
;
win
incredibly
;
win
at
such
a
rate
that
the
regular
player
at
the
table
crowd
round
me
;
and
stare
at
my
stake
with
hungry
,
superstitious
eye
,
whisper
to
one
another
that
the
english
stranger
be
go
to
break
the
bank
.
  
<EOS>
the
game
be
Rouge
et
Noir
.
<EOS>
I
have
play
at
it
in
every
city
in
Europe
,
without
,
however
,
the
care
or
the
wish
to
study
the
Theory
of
Chances
 
that
philosopher
's
stone
of
all
gambler
!
<EOS>
and
a
gambler
,
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
,
I
have
never
be
.
<EOS>
I
be
heart
-
whole
from
the
corrode
passion
for
play
.
<EOS>
My
gaming
be
a
mere
idle
amusement
.
<EOS>
I
never
resort
to
it
by
necessity
,
because
I
never
know
what
it
be
to
want
money
.
<EOS>
I
never
practice
it
so
incessantly
as
to
lose
more
than
I
could
afford
,
or
to
gain
more
than
I
could
coolly
pocket
without
be
throw
off
my
balance
by
my
good
luck
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
have
hitherto
frequent
gambling
-
table
 
just
as
I
frequent
ball
-
room
and
opera
-
house
 
because
they
amuse
me
,
and
because
I
have
nothing
well
to
do
with
my
leisure
hour
.
  
<EOS>
but
on
this
occasion
it
be
very
different
 
now
,
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
,
I
feel
what
the
passion
for
play
really
be
.
<EOS>
My
success
first
bewilder
,
and
then
,
in
the
most
literal
meaning
of
the
word
,
intoxicate
me
.
<EOS>
incredible
as
it
may
appear
,
it
be
nevertheless
true
,
that
I
only
lose
when
I
attempt
to
estimate
chance
,
and
play
accord
to
previous
calculation
.
<EOS>
if
I
leave
everything
to
luck
,
and
stake
without
any
care
or
consideration
,
I
be
sure
to
win
 
to
win
in
the
face
of
every
recognize
probability
in
favor
of
the
bank
.
<EOS>
at
first
some
of
the
man
present
venture
their
money
safely
enough
on
my
color
;
but
I
speedily
increase
my
stake
to
sum
which
they
dare
not
risk
.
<EOS>
one
after
another
they
leave
off
playing
,
and
breathlessly
look
on
at
my
game
.
  
<EOS>
still
,
time
after
time
,
I
stake
higher
and
high
,
and
still
win
.
<EOS>
the
excitement
in
the
room
rise
to
fever
pitch
.
<EOS>
the
silence
be
interrupt
by
a
deep
-
muttered
chorus
of
oath
and
exclamation
in
different
language
,
every
time
the
gold
be
shovel
across
to
my
side
of
the
table
 
even
the
imperturbable
croupier
dash
his
rake
on
the
floor
in
a
(
French
)
fury
of
astonishment
at
my
success
.
<EOS>
but
one
man
present
preserve
his
self
-
possession
,
and
that
man
be
my
friend
.
<EOS>
He
come
to
my
side
,
and
whisper
in
English
,
beg
me
to
leave
the
place
,
satisfied
with
what
I
have
already
gain
.
<EOS>
I
must
do
him
the
justice
to
say
that
he
repeat
his
warning
and
entreatie
several
time
,
and
only
leave
me
and
go
away
after
I
have
reject
his
advice
<EOS>
(
I
be
to
all
intent
and
purpose
gamble
drunk
)
in
term
which
render
it
impossible
for
him
to
address
me
again
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
shortly
after
he
have
go
,
a
hoarse
voice
behind
me
cry
:
"
permit
me
,
my
dear
sir
 
<EOS>
permit
me
to
restore
to
their
proper
place
two
napoleon
which
you
have
drop
.
<EOS>
wonderful
luck
,
sir
!
<EOS>
I
pledge
you
my
word
of
honor
,
as
an
old
soldier
,
in
the
course
of
my
long
experience
in
this
sort
of
thing
,
I
never
see
such
luck
as
your
 
never

<EOS>
go
on
,
sir
 
Sacre

<EOS>
go
on
boldly
,
and
break
the
bank
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
turn
round
and
see
,
nod
and
smile
at
me
with
inveterate
civility
,
a
tall
man
,
dress
in
a
frog
and
braid
surtout
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
in
my
sense
,
I
should
have
consider
him
,
personally
,
as
be
rather
a
suspicious
speciman
of
an
old
soldier
.
<EOS>
He
have
goggling
,
bloodshot
eye
,
mangy
mustache
,
and
a
broken
nose
.
<EOS>
His
voice
betray
a
barrack
-
room
intonation
of
the
bad
order
,
and
he
have
the
dirty
pair
of
hand
I
ever
see
 
even
in
France
.
<EOS>
these
little
personal
peculiarity
exercise
,
however
,
no
repelling
influence
on
me
.
<EOS>
in
the
mad
excitement
,
the
reckless
triumph
of
that
moment
,
I
be
ready
to
"
fraternize
"
with
anybody
who
encourage
me
in
my
game
.
<EOS>
I
accept
the
old
soldier
's
offer
pinch
of
snuff
;
clap
him
on
the
back
,
and
swear
he
be
the
honest
fellow
in
the
world
 
<EOS>
the
most
glorious
relic
of
the
Grand
Army
that
I
have
ever
meet
with
.
<EOS>
"

"
<EOS>
cry
my
military
friend
,
snap
his
finger
in
ecstasy
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>

<EOS>
and
I
do
go
on
 
<EOS>
go
on
at
such
a
rate
,
that
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
the
croupier

out
,
"

the

tie

"
  
<EOS>
the
old
soldier
wag
his
head
,
roll
his
goggle
-
eye
,
until
I
expect
to
see
 
them
slip
out
of
their
socket
;
place
his
dirty
forefinger
by
the
side
of
his
broken
nose
;
solemnly
ejaculated
"
coffee

"
and
immediately
run
off
into
an
inner
room
.
  
<EOS>
the
word
pronounce
by
the
eccentric
veteran
seem
to
have
a
magical
effect
on
the
rest
of
the
company
present
.
<EOS>
with
one
accord
they
all
rise
to
depart
.
<EOS>
probably
they
have
expect
to
profit
by
my
intoxication
;
but
find
that
my
new
friend
be
benevolently
bent
on
prevent
me
from
get
dead
drunk

have
now
abandon
all
hope
of
thrive
pleasantly
on

<EOS>
whatever
their
motive
may
be
,
at
any
rate
they
go
away
in

body

<EOS>
when
the
old
soldier
return
,
and
sit
down
again
opposite
to
me
at
the
table
,
we
have
the
room
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
the
croupier
,
in
a
sort
of
vestibule
which
open
out
of
it
,
eat
his
supper
in
solitude
.

He
assume
a
portentously
solemn
look

speak

again
,
his
speech
be
ornament
by
no
oath

enforce
by
no

snapping

enliven

<EOS>
"
listen

my

say
he
,
in
mysteriously
confidential
tone

listen
to
an
old
soldier
's
advice

<EOS>
I
have
be
to
the
mistress
of
the
house
(
a
very
charming
woman

with
a
genius
for
cookery

<EOS>
to
impress
on
her
the
necessity
of
make
us
some
particularly
strong
and
good
coffee
.
<EOS>
You
must
drink
this
coffee
in
order
to
get
rid
of
your
little
amiable
exaltation
of
spirit
before
you
think
of
go
home

<EOS>
with

it
be
a
sacred
duty
to
yourself
to

<EOS>
You
be
know
to
be
a

enormous
extent

in

<EOS>
now

this
be
what
you
must
do
 
send
for
a
cabriolet
when

well
again

draw
up
all
the
window
when
you

thank
an

you
a

"
  
<EOS>
just
as
the
ex
-
brave
end
his
oration
in
very
lachrymose
tone
,
the
coffee
come
in
,
ready
pour
out
in
two
cup
.
<EOS>
My
attentive
friend
hand
me
one
of
the
cup
with
a
bow
.
<EOS>
I
be
parch
with
thirst
,
and
drank
it
off
at
a
draught
.
<EOS>
almost
instantly
afterwards
,
I
be
seize
with
a
fit
of
giddiness
,
and
feel
more
completely
intoxicate
than
ever
.
<EOS>
the
room
whirl
round
and
round
furiously
;
the
old
soldier
seem
to
be
regularly
bob
up
and
down
before
me
like
the
piston
of
a
steam
-
engine
.
<EOS>
I
be
half
deafen
by
a
violent
singing
in
my
ear
;
a
feeling
of
utter
bewilderment
,
helplessness
,
idiocy
,
overcome
me
.
<EOS>
I
rise
from
my
chair
,
hold
on
by
the
table
to
keep
my
balance
;
and
stammer
out
that
I
feel
dreadfully
unwell
 
<EOS>
so
unwell
that
I
do
not
know
how
I
be
to
get
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
friend
,
"
answer
the
old
soldier
 
and
even
his
voice
seem
to
be
bob
up
and
down
as
he
speak
 
"
my
dear
friend
,
it
would
be
madness
to
go
home
in
your
state
;
you
would
be
sure
to
lose
your
money
;
you
may
be
rob
and
murder
with
the
great
ease
.

I

make
up
capital
bed
in
this

take
one
;
sleep
off
the
effect
of
the
wine

go
home
safely
with
your
winning
to

morrow
 
to
-
morrow
,
in
broad
daylight
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
but
two
idea
leave
:
one
,
that
I
must
never
let
go
hold
of
my
handkerchief
full
of
money
;
<EOS>
the
other
,
that
I
must
lie
down
somewhere
immediately
,
and
fall
off
into
a
comfortable
sleep
.
<EOS>
so
I
agree
to
the
proposal
about
the
bed
,
and
take
the
offer
arm
of
the
old
soldier
,
carry
my
money
with
my
disengaged
hand
.
<EOS>
precede
by
the
croupier
,
we
pass
along
some
passage
and
up
a
flight
of
stair
into
the
bedroom
which
I
be
to
occupy
.
<EOS>
the
ex
-
brave
shake
me
warmly
by
the
hand
,
propose
that
we
should
breakfast
together
,
and
then
,
follow
by
the
croupier
,
leave
me
for
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
I
run
to
the
wash
-
hand
stand
;
drank
some
of
the
water
in
my
jug
;
pour
the
rest
out
,
and
plunge
my
face
into
it
;
then
sit
down
in
a
chair
and
try
to
compose
myself
.
<EOS>
I
soon
feel
well
.
<EOS>
the
change
for
my
lung
,
from
the
fetid
atmosphere
of
the
gambling
-
room
to
the
cool
air
of
the
apartment
I
now
occupy
,
the
almost
equally
refresh
change
for
my
eye
,
from
the
glaring
gaslight
of
the
"
salon
"
to
the
dim
,
quiet
flicker
of
one
bedroom
-
candle
,
aid
wonderfully
the
restorative
effect
of
cold
water
.
<EOS>
the
giddiness
leave
me
,
and
I
begin
to
feel
a
little
like
a
reasonable
being
again
.
<EOS>
My
first
thought
be
of
the
risk
of
sleep
all
night
in
a
gambling
-
house
;
my
second
,
of
the
still
great
risk
of
try
to
get
out
after
the
house
be
closed
,
and
of
go
home
alone
at
night
through
the
street
of
Paris
with
a
large
sum
of
money
about
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
sleep
in
bad
place
than
this
on
my
travel
;
so
I
determine
to
lock
,
bolt
,
and
barricade
my
door
,
and
take
my
chance
till
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
I
secure
myself
against
all
intrusion
;
look
under
the
bed
,
and
into
the
cupboard
;
try
the
fastening
of
the
window
;
and
then
,
satisfy
that
I
have
take
every
proper
precaution
,
pull
off
my
upper
clothing
,
put
my
light
,
which
be
a
dim
one
,
on
the
hearth
among
a
feathery
litter
of
wood
-
ashe
,
and
get
into
bed
,
with
the
handkerchief
full
of
money
under
my
pillow
.
  
<EOS>
I
soon
feel
not
only
that
I
could
not
go
to
sleep
,
but
that
I
could
not
even
close
my
eye
.
<EOS>
I
be
wide
awake
,
and
in
a
high
fever
.
<EOS>
every
nerve
in
my
body
tremble
 
<EOS>
every
one
of
my
sense
seem
to
be
preternaturally
sharpen
.
<EOS>
I
toss
and
roll
,
and
try
every
kind
of
position
,
and
perseveringly
seek
out
the
cold
corner
of
the
bed
,
and
all
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
now
I
thrust
my
arm
over
the
clothe
;
now
I
poke
them
under
the
clothe
;
now
I
violently
shoot
my
leg
straight
out
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
bed
;
now
I
convulsively
coil
them
up
as
near
my
chin
as
they
would
go
;
now
I
shake
out
my
crumple
pillow
,
change
it
to
the
cool
side
,
pat
it
flat
,
and
lie
down
quietly
on
my
back
;
now
I
fiercely
double
it
in
two
,
set
it
up
on
end
,
thrust
it
against
the
board
of
the
bed
,
and
try
a
sit
posture
.
<EOS>
every
effort
be
in
vain
;
I
groan
with
vexation
as
I
feel
that
I
be
in
for
a
sleepless
night
.
  
<EOS>
what
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
I
have
no
book
to
read
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
unless
I
find
out
some
method
of
divert
my
mind
,
I
feel
certain
that
I
be
in
the
condition
to
imagine
all
sort
of
horror
;
to
rack
my
brain
with
foreboding
of
every
possible
and
impossible
danger
;
in
short
,
to
pass
the
night
in
suffer
all
conceivable
variety
of
nervous
terror
.
  
<EOS>
I
raise
myself
on
my
elbow
,
and
look
about
the
room
 
which
be
brighten
by
a
lovely
moonlight
pour
straight
through
the
window
 
to
see
if
it
contain
any
picture
or
ornament
that
I
could
at
all
clearly
distinguish
.
<EOS>
while
my
eye
wander
from
wall
to
wall
,
a
remembrance
of
Le
Maistre
's
delightful
little
book
,
"
Voyage
autour
de
ma
Chambre
,
"
occur
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
resolve
to
imitate
the
french
author
,
and
find
occupation
and
amusement
enough
to
relieve
the
tedium
of
my
wakefulness
,
by
make
a
mental
inventory
of
every
article
of
furniture
I
could
see
,
and
by
follow
up
to
their
source
the
multitude
of
association
which
even
a
chair
,
a
table
,
or
a
wash
-
hand
stand
may
be
make
to
call
forth
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
nervous
unsettled
state
of
my
mind
at
that
moment
,
I
find
it
much
easy
to
make
my
inventory
than
to
make
my
reflection
,
and
thereupon
soon
give
up
all
hope
of
think
in
Le
Maistre
's
fanciful
track
 
or
,
indeed
,
of
think
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
look
about
the
room
at
the
different
article
of
furniture
,
and
do
nothing
more
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
first
,
the
bed
I
be
lie
in
;
a
four
-
post
bed
,
of
all
thing
in
the
world
to
meet
with
in
Paris
 
<EOS>
yes
,
a
thorough
clumsy
british
four
-
poster
,
with
the
regular
top
line
with
chintz
 
<EOS>
the
regular
fringed
valance
all
round
 
the
regular
stifling
,
unwholesome
curtain
,
which
I
remember
have
mechanically
draw
back
against
the
post
without
particularly
notice
the
bed
when
I
first
get
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
the
marble
-
top
wash
-
hand
stand
,
from
which
the
water
I
have
spill
,
in
my
hurry
to
pour
it
out
,
be
still
drip
,
slowly
and
more
slowly
,
on
to
the
brick
floor
.
<EOS>
then
two
small
chair
,
with
my
coat
,
waistcoat
,
and
trouser
fling
on
them
.
<EOS>
then
a
large
elbow
-
chair
cover
with
dirty
-
white
dimity
,
with
my
cravat
and
shirt
collar
throw
over
the
back
.
<EOS>
then
a
chest
of
drawer
with
two
of
the
brass
handle
off
,
and
a
tawdry
,
break
china
inkstand
place
on
it
by
way
of
ornament
for
the
top
.
<EOS>
then
the
dressing
-
table
,
adorn
by
a
very
small
looking
-
glass
,
and
a
very
large
pincushion
.
<EOS>
then
the
window
 
an
unusually
large
window
.
<EOS>
then
a
dark
old
picture
,
which
the
feeble
candle
dimly
show
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
picture
of
a
fellow
in
a
high
spanish
hat
,
crown
with
a
plume
of
tower
feather
.
<EOS>
a
swarthy
,
sinister
ruffian
,
look
upward
,
shade
his
eye
with
his
hand
,
and
look
intently
upward
 
it
may
be
at
some
tall
gallow
at
which
he
be
go
to
be
hang
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
he
have
the
appearance
of
thoroughly
deserve
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
picture
put
a
kind
of
constraint
upon
me
to
look
upward
too
 
at
the
top
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
gloomy
and
not
an
interesting
object
,
and
I
look
back
at
the
picture
.
<EOS>
I
count
the
feather
in
the
man
's
hat
 
<EOS>
they
stand
out
in
relief
 
<EOS>
three
white
,
two
green
.
<EOS>
I
observe
the
crown
of
his
hat
,
which
be
of
conical
shape
,
accord
to
the
fashion
suppose
to
have
be
favor
by
Guido
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
he
be
look
up
at
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
at
the
star
;
such
a
desperado
be
neither
astrologer
nor
astronomer
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
at
the
high
gallow
,
and
he
be
go
to
be
hang
presently
.
<EOS>
Would
the
executioner
come
into
possession
of
his
conical
crown
hat
and
plume
of
feather
?
<EOS>
I
count
the
feather
again
 
three
white
,
two
green
.
  
<EOS>
while
I
still
linger
over
this
very
improving
and
intellectual
employment
,
my
thought
insensibly
begin
to
wander
.
<EOS>
the
moonlight
shine
into
the
room
remind
me
of
a
certain
moonlight
night
in
England
 
<EOS>
the
night
after
a
picnic
party
in
a
Welsh
valley
.
<EOS>
every
incident
of
the
drive
homeward
,
through
lovely
scenery
,
which
the
moonlight
make
lovely
than
ever
,
come
back
to
my
remembrance
,
though
I
have
never
give
the
picnic
a
thought
for
year
;
though
,
if
I
have
try
to
recollect
it
,
I
could
certainly
have
recall
little
or
nothing
of
that
scene
long
past
.
<EOS>
of
all
the
wonderful
faculty
that
help
to
tell
us
we
be
immortal
,
which
speak
the
sublime
truth
more
eloquently
than
memory
?
<EOS>
here
be
I
,
in
a
strange
house
of
the
most
suspicious
character
,
in
a
situation
of
uncertainty
,
and
even
of
peril
,
which
may
seem
to
make
the
cool
exercise
of
my
recollection
almost
out
of
the
question
;
nevertheless
,
remember
,
quite
involuntarily
,
place
,
people
,
conversation
,
minute
circumstance
of
every
kind
,
which
I
have
think
forget
forever
;
which
I
could
not
possibly
have
recall
at
will
,
even
under
the
most
favorable
auspex
.
<EOS>
and
what
cause
have
produce
in
a
moment
the
whole
of
this
strange
,
complicated
,
mysterious
effect
?
<EOS>
nothing
but
some
ray
of
moonlight
shine
in
at
my
bedroom
window
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
still
think
of
the
picnic
 
of
our
merriment
on
the
drive
home
 
of
the
sentimental
young
lady
who
would
quote
"
Childe
Harold
"
because
it
be
moonlight
.
<EOS>
I
be
absorb
by
these
past
scene
and
past
amusement
,
when
,
in
an
instant
,
the
thread
on
which
my
memory
hang
snap
asunder
;
my
attention
immediately
come
back
to
present
thing
more
vividly
than
ever
,
and
I
find
myself
<EOS>
,
I
neither
know
why
nor
wherefore
,
look
hard
at
the
picture
again
.
  
<EOS>
look
for
what
?
  
<EOS>
good
God
!
<EOS>
the
man
have
pull
his
hat
down
on
his
brow
!
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
the
hat
itself
be
go
!
<EOS>
where
be
the
conical
crown
?
<EOS>
where
the
feather
 
three
white
,
two
green
?
<EOS>
not
there
!
<EOS>
in
place
of
the
hat
and
feather
,
what
dusky
object
be
it
that
now
hide
his
forehead
,
his
eye
,
his
shade
hand
?
  
<EOS>
be
the
bed
move
?
  
<EOS>
I
turn
on
my
back
and
look
up
.
<EOS>
be
I
mad
?
<EOS>
drunk
?
<EOS>
dream
?
<EOS>
giddy
again
?
<EOS>
or
be
the
top
of
the
bed
really
move
down
 
sink
slowly
,
regularly
,
silently
,
horribly
,
right
down
throughout
the
whole
of
its
length
and
breadth
 
right
down
upon
me
,
as
I
lie
underneath
?
  
<EOS>
My
blood
seem
to
stand
still
.
<EOS>
a
deadly
paralyse
coldness
stole
all
over
me
as
I
turn
my
head
round
on
the
pillow
and
determine
to
test
whether
the
bed
-
top
be
really
move
or
not
,
by
keep
my
eye
on
the
man
in
the
picture
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
look
in
that
direction
be
enough
.
<EOS>
the
dull
,
black
,
frowzy
outline
of
the
valance
above
me
be
within
an
inch
of
be
parallel
with
his
waist
.
<EOS>
I
still
look
breathlessly
.
<EOS>
and
steadily
and
slowly
 
very
slowly
 
I
see
the
figure
,
and
the
line
of
frame
below
the
figure
,
vanish
,
as
the
valance
move
down
before
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
,
constitutionally
,
anything
but
timid
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
on
more
than
one
occasion
in
peril
of
my
life
,
and
have
not
lose
my
self
-
possession
for
an
instant
;
but
when
the
conviction
first
settle
on
my
mind
that
the
bed
-
top
be
really
move
,
be
steadily
and
continuously
sink
down
upon
me
,
I
look
up
shudder
,
helpless
,
panic
-
stricken
,
beneath
the
hideous
machinery
for
murder
,
which
be
advance
closer
and
closer
to
suffocate
me
where
I
lie
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
up
,
motionless
,
speechless
,
breathless
.
<EOS>
the
candle
,
fully
spend
,
go
out
;
but
the
moonlight
still
brighten
the
room
.
<EOS>
down
and
down
,
without
pause
and
without
sound
,
come
the
bed
-
top
,
and
still
my
panic
-
terror
seem
to
bind
me
faster
and
faster
to
the
mattress
on
which
I
lie
 
down
and
down
<EOS>
it
sink
,
till
the
dusty
odor
from
the
lining
of
the
canopy
come
steal
into
my
nostril
.
  
<EOS>
at
that
final
moment
the
instinct
of
self
-
preservation
startle
me
out
of
my
trance
,
and
I
move
at
last
.
<EOS>
there
be
just
room
for
me
to
roll
myself
sidewise
off
the
bed
.
<EOS>
as
I
drop
noiselessly
to
the
floor
,
the
edge
of
the
murderous
canopy
touch
me
on
the
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
without
stop
to
draw
my
breath
,
without
wipe
the
cold
sweat
from
my
face
,
I
rise
instantly
on
my
knee
to
watch
the
bed
-
top
.
<EOS>
I
be
literally
spellbound
by
it
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
hear
footstep
behind
me
,
I
could
not
have
turn
round
;
if
a
means
of
escape
have
be
miraculously
provide
for
me
,
I
could
not
have
move
to
take
advantage
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
whole
life
in
me
be
,
at
that
moment
,
concentrate
in
my
eye
.
  
<EOS>
It
descend
 
the
whole
canopy
,
with
the
fringe
round
it
,
come
down
 
down
 
close
down
;
so
close
that
there
be
not
room
now
to
squeeze
my
finger
between
the
bed
-
top
and
the
bed
.
<EOS>
I
feel
at
the
side
,
and
discover
that
what
have
appear
to
me
from
beneath
to
be
the
ordinary
light
canopy
of
a
four
-
post
bed
be
in
reality
a
thick
,
broad
mattress
,
the
substance
of
which
be
conceal
by
the
valance
and
its
fringe
.
<EOS>
I
look
up
and
see
the
four
post
rise
hideously
bare
.
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
the
bed
-
top
be
a
huge
wooden
screw
that
have
evidently
work
it
down
through
a
hole
in
the
ceiling
,
just
as
ordinary
press
be
work
down
on
the
substance
select
for
compression
.
<EOS>
the
frightful
apparatus
move
without
make
the
faint
noise
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
no
creaking
as
it
come
down
;
there
be
now
not
the
faint
sound
from
the
room
above
.
<EOS>
amid
a
dead
and
awful
silence
I
beheld
before
me
 
in
the
nineteenth
century
,
and
in
the
civilized
capital
of
France
 
such
a
machine
for
secret
murder
by
suffocation
as
may
have
exist
in
the
bad
day
of
the
Inquisition
,
in
the
lonely
inn
among
the
Hartz
Mountains
,
in
the
mysterious
tribunal
of
Westphalia
!
<EOS>
still
,
as
I
look
on
it
,
I
could
not
move
,
I
could
hardly
breathe
,
but
I
begin
to
recover
the
power
of
thinking
,
and
in
a
moment
I
discover
the
murderous
conspiracy
frame
against
me
in
all
its
horror
.
  
<EOS>
My
cup
of
coffee
have
be
drug
,
and
drug
too
strongly
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
save
from
be
smother
by
have
take
an
overdose
of
some
narcotic
.
<EOS>
how
I
have
chafe
and
fret
at
the
fever
fit
which
have
preserve
my
life
by
keep
me
awake
!
<EOS>
how
recklessly
I
have
confide
myself
to
the
two
wretch
who
have
lead
me
into
this
room
,
determine
,
for
the
sake
of
my
winning
,
to
kill
me
in
my
sleep
by
the
sure
and
most
horrible
contrivance
for
secretly
accomplish
my
destruction
!
<EOS>
how
many
man
,
winner
like
me
,
have
sleep
,
as
 
I
have
propose
to
sleep
,
in
that
bed
,
and
have
never
be
see
or
hear
of
more
!
<EOS>
I
shudder
at
the
bare
idea
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
ere
long
,
all
thought
be
again
suspend
by
the
sight
of
the
murderous
canopy
move
once
more
.
<EOS>
after
it
have
remain
on
the
bed
 
as
nearly
as
I
could
guess
 
about
ten
minute
,
it
begin
to
move
up
again
.
<EOS>
the
villain
who
work
it
from
above
evidently
believe
that
their
purpose
be
now
accomplish
.
<EOS>
slowly
and
silently
,
as
it
have
descend
,
that
horrible
bed
-
top
rise
towards
its
former
place
.
<EOS>
when
it
reach
the
upper
extremity
of
the
four
post
,
it
reach
the
ceiling
,
too
.
<EOS>
neither
hole
nor
screw
could
be
see
;
the
bed
become
in
appearance
an
ordinary
bed
again
 
<EOS>
the
canopy
an
ordinary
canopy
 
<EOS>
even
to
the
most
suspicious
eye
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
I
be
able
to
move
 
to
rise
from
my
knee
 
to
dress
myself
in
my
upper
clothing
 
and
to
consider
of
how
I
should
escape
.
<EOS>
if
I
betray
by
the
small
noise
that
the
attempt
to
suffocate
me
have
fail
,
I
be
certain
to
be
murder
.
<EOS>
have
I
make
any
noise
already
?
<EOS>
I
listen
intently
,
look
towards
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
no
footstep
in
the
passage
outside
 
no
sound
of
a
tread
,
light
or
heavy
,
in
the
room
above
 
absolute
silence
everywhere
.
<EOS>
besides
lock
and
bolt
my
door
,
I
have
move
an
old
wooden
chest
against
it
,
which
I
have
find
under
the
bed
.
<EOS>
to
remove
this
chest
(
my
blood
run
cold
as
I
think
of
what
its
content
may
be
!
)
<EOS>
without
make
some
disturbance
be
impossible
;
and
,
moreover
,
to
think
of
escape
through
the
house
,
now
bar
up
for
the
night
,
be
sheer
insanity
.
<EOS>
only
one
chance
be
leave
me
 
the
window
.
<EOS>
I
steal
to
it
on
tiptoe
.
  
<EOS>
My
bedroom
be
on
the
first
floor
,
above
an
entresol
,
and
look
into
a
back
street
,
which
you
have
sketch
in
your
view
.
<EOS>
I
raise
my
hand
to
open
the
window
,
know
that
on
that
action
hang
,
by
the
mere
hair
-
breadth
,
my
chance
of
safety
.
<EOS>
They
keep
vigilant
watch
in
a
House
of
Murder
.
<EOS>
if
any
part
of
the
frame
crack
,
if
the
hinge
creak
,
I
be
a
lost
man
!
<EOS>
It
must
have
occupy
me
at
least
five
minute
,
reckon
by
time
 
five
hour
,
reckon
by
suspense
 
to
open
that
window
.
<EOS>
I
succeed
in
do
it
silently
 
in
do
it
with
all
the
dexterity
of
a
house
-
breaker
 
and
then
look
down
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
to
leap
the
distance
beneath
me
would
be
almost
certain
destruction
!
<EOS>
next
,
I
look
round
at
the
side
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
down
the
left
side
run
a
thick
water
-
pipe
which
you
have
draw
 
<EOS>
it
pass
close
by
the
outer
edge
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
the
moment
I
see
the
pipe
I
know
I
be
save
.
<EOS>
My
breath
come
and
go
freely
for
the
first
time
since
I
have
see
the
canopy
of
the
bed
move
down
upon
me
!
  
<EOS>
to
some
man
the
mean
of
escape
which
I
have
discover
may
have
seem
difficult
and
dangerous
enough
 
to
me
the
prospect
of
slip
down
the
pipe
into
the
street
do
not
suggest
even
a
thought
of
peril
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
be
accustom
,
by
the
practice
of
gymnastic
,
to
keep
up
my
school
-
boy
power
as
a
daring
and
expert
climber
;
and
know
that
my
head
,
hand
,
and
foot
would
serve
me
faithfully
in
any
hazard
of
ascent
or
descent
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
get
one
leg
over
the
window
-
sill
,
when
I
remember
the
handkerchief
fill
with
money
under
my
pillow
.
<EOS>
I
could
well
have
afford
to
leave
it
behind
me
,
but
I
be
revengefully
determine
that
the
miscreant
of
the
gambling
-
house
should
miss
their
plunder
as
well
as
their
victim
.
<EOS>
so
I
go
back
to
the
bed
and
tie
the
heavy
handkerchief
at
my
back
by
my
cravat
.
  
<EOS>
just
as
I
have
make
it
tight
and
fix
it
in
a
comfortable
place
,
I
think
I
hear
a
sound
of
breathing
outside
the
door
.
<EOS>
the
chill
feeling
of
horror
run
through
me
again
as
I
listen
.
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
dead
silence
still
in
the
passage
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
hear
the
night
air
blow
softly
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
the
next
moment
I
be
on
the
window
-
sill
 
<EOS>
and
the
next
I
have
a
firm
grip
on
the
water
-
pipe
with
my
hand
and
knee
.
  
<EOS>
I
slide
down
into
the
street
easily
and
quietly
,
as
I
think
I
should
,
and
immediately
set
off
at
the
top
of
my
speed
to
a
branch
"
prefecture
"
of
Police
,
which
I
know
be
situate
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
a
"
Sub
-
prefect
,
"
and
several
pick
man
among
his
subordinate
,
happen
to
be
up
,
mature
,
I
believe
,
some
scheme
for
discover
the
perpetrator
of
a
mysterious
murder
which
all
Paris
be
talk
of
just
then
.
<EOS>
when
I
begin
my
story
,
in
a
breathless
hurry
and
in
very
bad
French
,
I
could
see
that
the
Sub
-
prefect
suspect
me
of
be
a
drunken
Englishman
who
have
rob
somebody
;
but
he
soon
alter
his
opinion
as
I
go
on
,
and
before
I
have
anything
like
conclude
,
he
shove
all
the
paper
before
him
into
a
drawer
,
put
on
his
hat
,
supply
me
with
another
(
for
I
be
bareheade
)
,
order
a
file
of
soldier
,
desire
his
expert
follower
to
get
ready
all
sort
of
tool
for
break
open
door
and
rip
up
brick
flooring
,
and
take
my
arm
,
in
the
most
friendly
and
familiar
manner
possible
,
to
lead
me
with
him
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
will
venture
to
say
that
when
the
Sub
-
prefect
be
a
little
boy
,
and
be
take
for
the
first
time
to
the
play
,
he
be
not
half
as
much
pleased
as
he
be
now
at
the
job
in
prospect
for
him
at
the
gambling
-
house
!
  
<EOS>
away
we
go
through
the
street
,
the
Sub
-
prefect
cross
-
examine
and
congratulate
me
in
the
same
breath
as
we
march
at
the
head
of
our
formidable
posse
comitatus
.
<EOS>
sentinel
be
place
at
the
back
and
front
of
the
house
the
moment
we
get
to
it
;
a
tremendous
battery
of
knock
be
direct
against
the
door
;
a
light
appear
at
a
window
;
I
be
tell
to
conceal
myself
behind
the
police
 
then
come
more
knock
and
a
cry
of
"
open
in
the
name
of
the
law
!
"
<EOS>
at
that
terrible
summon
bolt
and
lock
give
way
before
an
invisible
hand
,
and
the
moment
after
the
Sub
-
prefect
be
in
the
passage
,
confront
a
waiter
half
-
dressed
and
ghastly
pale
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
short
dialogue
which
immediately
take
place
:
  
<EOS>
"
We
want
to
see
the
Englishman

<EOS>

<EOS>
then
I
identify
the
bed
in
which
I
have
sleep
,
and
then
we
go
into
the
room
above
.
  
<EOS>
no

and
we
see
a
deep
rafter
cavity
between
the
floor
of
this
room
and
the

beneath
.
<EOS>
through
this

there

I
can
not
let
this
story
end
without
mention
what
the
chance
say
be
which
cause
it
to
be
tell
at
the
farmhouse
the
other
night
.
<EOS>
Our
friend
the
young
sailor
,
among
his
other
quaint
objection
to
sleep
on
shore
,
declare
that
he
particularly
hate
four
-
post
bed
,
because
he
never
sleep
in
one
without
doubt
whether
the
top
may
not
come
down
in
the
night
and
suffocate
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
this
chance
reference
to
the
distinguish
feature
of
William
's
narrative
curious
enough
,
and
my
husband
agree
with
me
.
<EOS>
but
he
say
it
be
scarcely
worth
while
to
mention
such
a
trifle
in
anything
so
important
as
a
book
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
venture
,
after
this
,
to
do
more
than
slip
these
line
in
modestly
at
the
end
of
the
story

<EOS>
if
the

should
notice
my
few
last

perhaps

on

<EOS>
I

round

a
little

He

<EOS>
I
make
two
discovery
in
one
glance
at
him
:
<EOS>
first
,
that
he
be
a
wretched
subject
for
a
portrait
;
secondly
,
that
,
whatever
he
may
do
or
say
,
it
would
not
be
of
the

use
for
me

stand

You

<EOS>
He
chuckle
as
he
say
this
,
and
walk
away
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
useless
to
take
anything
he
say
seriously
,
so
I
finish
prepare
my
palette
for
the
morning

work
with
the
utmost
serenity

I
could

that

He

four

Mr.

utter
this
fatal
prophecy

when

turn
away

indulge
himself
in
a
brisk
turn

two
up

down

<EOS>
meanwhile
I
lift
my
canvas
on

<EOS>
His
odd

make
such
an

that
I

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
and
I

in
business
for
myself
in
one
of
our
english
country
town
<EOS>
,
I
decline
state
which
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
a
farthing
of
capital
,
and
my
friend
in
the
neighborhood
be
poor
and
useless
enough
,
with
one
exception
.
<EOS>
that
exception
be
Mr.
Frank
Gatliffe
,
son
of
Mr.
Gatliffe
,
member
for
the
county
,
the
rich
man
and
the
proud
for
many
a
mile
round
about
our
part
.
<EOS>
stop
a
bit
,
Mr.
Artist
,
you
need
not
perk
up
and
look
know
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
trace
any
particular
by
the
name
of
Gatliffe
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
bind
to
commit
myself
or
anybody
else
by
mention
name
.
<EOS>
I
have
give
you
the
first
that
come
into
my
head
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
Mr.
Frank
be
a
stanch
friend
of
mine
,
and
ready
to
recommend
me
whenever
he
get
the
chance
.
<EOS>
I
have
contrive
to
get
him
a
little
timely
help
 
for
a
consideration
,
of
course
 
in
borrow
money
at
a
fair
rate
of
interest
;
in
fact
,
I
have
save
him
from
the
Jews
.
<EOS>
the
money
be
borrow
while
Mr.
Frank
be
at
college
.
<EOS>
He
come
back
from
college
,
and
stop
at
home
a
little
while
,
and
then
there
get
spread
about
all
our
neighborhood
a
report
that
he
have
fall
in
love
,
as
the
saying
be
,
with
his
young
sister
's
governess
,
and
that
his
mind
be
make
up
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
you
be
at
it
again
,
Mr.
Artist
!
<EOS>
You
want
to
know
her
name
,
do
not
you
?
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
of
Smith
?
  
<EOS>
speak
as
a
lawyer
,
I
consider
report
,
in
a
general
way
,
to
be
a
fool
and
a
liar
.
<EOS>
but
in
this
case
report
turn
out
to
be
something
very
different
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Frank
tell
me
he
be
really
in
love
,
and
say
upon
his
honor
(
an
absurd
expression
which
young
chap
of
his
age
be
always
use
)
he
be
determined
to
marry
Smith
,
the
governess
 
<EOS>
the
sweet
,
darle
girl
,
as
he
call
her
;
but
I
be
not
sentimental
,
and
I
call
her
Smith
,
the
governess
.
<EOS>
well
,
Mr.
Frank
's
father
,
be
as
proud
as
Lucifer
,
say
"
no
,
"
as
to
marry
the
governess
,
when
Mr.
Frank
want
him
to
say
"
<EOS>
yes
.
"
He
be
a
man
of
business
,
be
old
Gatliffe
,
and
he
take
the
proper
business
course
.
<EOS>
He
send
the
governess
away
with
a
first
-
rate
character
and
a
spanking
present
,
and
then
he
,
look
about
him
to
get
something
for
Mr.
Frank
to
do
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
look
about
,
Mr.
Frank
bolt
to
London
after
the
governess
,
who
have
nobody
alive
belong
to
her
to
go
to
but
an
aunt
 
her
father
's
sister
.
<EOS>
the
aunt
refuse
to
let
Mr.
Frank
in
without
the
squire
's
permission
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Frank
write
to
his
father
,
and
say
he
will
marry
the
girl
as
soon
as
he
be
of
age
,
or
shoot
himself
.
<EOS>
up
to
town
come
the
squire
and
his
wife
and
his
daughter
,
and
a
lot
of
sentimentality
,
not
in
the
slight
degree
material
to
the
present
statement
,
take
place
among
them
;
and
the
upshot
of
it
be
that
old
Gatliffe
be
force
into
withdraw
the
word
<EOS>
no
,
and
substitute
the
word
<EOS>
yes
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
he
would
ever
have
do
it
,
though
,
but
for
one
lucky
peculiarity
in
the
case
.
<EOS>
the
governess
's
father
be
a
man
of
good
family
 
pretty
nigh
as
good
as
Gatliffe
's
own
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
in
the
army
;
have
sell
out
;
set
up
as
a
wine
-
merchant
 
fail
 
die
;
ditto
his
wife
,
as
to
the
die
part
of
it
.
<EOS>
no
relation
,
in
fact
,
leave
for
the
squire
to
make
inquiry
about
but
<EOS>
the
father
's
sister
 
who
have
behave
,
as
old
Gatliffe
say
,
like
a
thorough
-
breed
gentlewoman
in
shut
the
door
against
Mr.
Frank
in
the
first
instance
.
<EOS>
so
,
to
cut
the
matter
short
,
thing
be
at
last
make
up
pleasant
enough
.
<EOS>
the
time
be
fix
for
the
wedding
,
and
an
announcement
about
it
 
marriage
in
high
Life
and
all
that
 
put
into
the
county
paper
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
regular
biography
,
besides
,
of
the
governess
's
father
,
so
as
to
stop
people
from
talk
 
a
great
flourish
about
his
pedigree
,
and
a
long
account
of
his
service
in
the
army
;
but
not
a
word
,
mind
ye
,
of
his
have
turn
wine
-
merchant
afterward
.
<EOS>
oh
,
no
 
not
a
word
about
that
!
  
<EOS>
I
know
it
,
though
,
for
Mr.
Frank
tell
me
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
a
bit
of
pride
about
him
.
<EOS>
He
introduce
me
to
his
future
wife
one
day
when
I
meet
him
out
walk
,
and
ask
me
if
I
do
not
think
he
be
a
lucky
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mind
admit
that
I
do
,
and
that
I
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
ah

down

every

It

<EOS>
His

rash
moment
 
atone
for
though

be
 
prey
upon
his
mind

<EOS>
He
become
possessed
with
the
idea
that

and

He

<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
let
's
go
back
for
a
minute
to
the
contrite
and
grateful
letter
that
he
write
.
<EOS>
My
experience
in
the
law
,
Mr.
Frank

have
convince
me
that
if
everybody
burn
everybody
else
's
letter
,
half
the
court
of

may
shut
up
shop

do
you

anything

an
avowal
or
confession
of
the
forgery
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
it
do
,
"
say
he

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Could
the
writer
express
his
contrition
properly
without
make
some
such
confession
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
quite
easy
,
if
he
have
be
a
lawyer

I.

<EOS>
but
never
mind
that
;
I
be
go
to
make
a
guess
 
<EOS>
a
desperate
guess

mind
.
<EOS>
Should
I
be
altogether
in
error
if
I
think
that
this
letter
have
be
steal
;
and
that
the
finger
of
Mr.
Davager
,
of
suspicious
commercial
celebrity
,
may
possibly
be
the
finger
which
take
it
?
<EOS>

that

exactly
what
I
want
to
make
you
understand

Mr.

so
remarkably
humorous

Your

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
clever

I
,
put
the

into
my
private
drawer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Clever

"
cry
Mr.

,
"
he
ought
to

<EOS>
I
would
have
do
it
myself

but
she
make
me

We

do
you
think
I
be

anything
libelous
against
your
excellent

character
when
I
assert
that
if
he

letter
he

off

at

Mr.

a
groan

even
that

bad
of

the

noble

say
that

paper
,
with
all
the
unanswerable
comment
this
scoundrel
would
be
sure
to
add

she

<EOS>
as
he

<EOS>
He
be
a
weak
young

ridiculously
fond
of

<EOS>
I
bring
him
back
to

with
another
rap

paper

knife

<EOS>
"
hold
up
,
Mr.

"
say
i.
<EOS>

I
have
a
question

two

<EOS>
"
yes

I
do
think

that
,
"

he
;
"

she
tell
me
she
be
quite
certain
that
there

that
one
letter

"
  
<EOS>
"
Will

for
it
?

I.
  
"
yes

"
say
Mr.
Frank

quite
peevish
with
me

such
a
question

<EOS>
He
be
an
easy

matter

Mr.

"

I
,
"
you
come
here
to
get
my
help
and
advice
in
this
extremely
ticklish
business

and
you
be
ready

as
I
know
without
ask
,
to
remunerate
me
for
all
and
any
of
my
service
at
the
usual
professional
rate

<EOS>
now
,
I
have
make
up
my
mind
to
act
boldly
 
desperately
,
if
you
like
 
on
the
hit

miss
,
win
all

lose
all
principle
 
in

<EOS>
here

my
proposal

I
be
go
to
try

not
do
Mr.

out
of

I
do
not
succeed
before
to

morrow
afternoon

you
hand
him
the
money

I
charge
you
nothing

professional
service

<EOS>
if
I
do
succeed
,
I
hand
you
the
letter
instead
of
Mr.
Davager
,
and
you
give
me
the
money
instead
of
give
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
precious
risk
for
me
,
but
I
be
ready
to
run
it
.
<EOS>
You
must
pay
your
five
hundred
any
way
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
say
to
my
plan
?
<EOS>
be
it
<EOS>
yes
,
Mr.

no

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
hang
your

jump
up
;

very
good

now
go
home

comfort
the

<EOS>
do
not
let
Mr.
Davager
so
much
as
set
eye
on
you
 
<EOS>
keep
quiet
 
leave
everything
to
me
 
and
feel
as
certain
as
you
please
that
all
the
letter
in
the
world
can
not
stop
your
be
marry
on
Wednesday
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
with
these
word
I
hustle
him
off
out
of
the
office
,
for
I
want
to
be
leave
alone
to
make
my
mind
up
about
what
I
should
do
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
thing
,
of
course
,
be
to
have
a
look
at
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
I
write
to
Mr.
Davager
,
tell
him
that
I
be
privately
appoint
to
arrange
the
little
business
matter
between
himself
and
"
another
party
"
(
no
name
!
)
<EOS>
on
friendly
term
;
and
beg
him
to
call
on
me
at
his
early
convenience
.
<EOS>
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
case
,
Mr.
Davager
bother
me
.
<EOS>
His
answer
be
,
that
it
would
not
be
convenient
to
him
to
call
till
between
six
and
seven
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
,
you
see
,
he
contrive
to
make
me
lose
several
precious
hour
,
at
a
time
when
minute
almost
be
of
importance
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
for
it
but
to
be
patient
,
and
to
give
certain
instruction
,
before
Mr.
Davager
come
,
to
my
boy
Tom
.
  
<EOS>
there
never
be
such
a
sharp
boy
of
fourteen
before
,
and
there
never
will
be
again
,
as
my
boy
Tom
.
<EOS>
a
spy
to
look
after
Mr.
Davager
be
,
of
course
,
the
first
requisite
in
a
case
of
this
kind
;
and
<EOS>
Tom
be
the
small
,
quick
,
quiet
,
sharp
,
stealthiest
little
snake
of
a
chap
that
ever
dog
a
gentleman
's
step
and
keep
cleverly
out
of
range
of
a
gentleman
's
eye
.
<EOS>
I
settle
it
with
the
boy
that
he
be
not
to
show
at
all
when
Mr.
Davager
come
;
and
that
he
be
to
wait
to
hear
me
ring
the
bell
when
Mr.
Davager
leave
.
<EOS>
if
I
ring
twice
,
he
be
to
show
the
gentleman
out
.
<EOS>
if
I
ring
once
,
he
be
to
keep
out
of
the
way
,
and
follow
the
gentleman
whereever
he
go
till
he
get
back
to
the
inn
.
<EOS>
those
be
the
only
preparation
I
could
make
to
begin
with
;
be
oblige
to
wait
,
and
let
myself
be
guide
by
what
turn
up
.
  
<EOS>
about
a
quarter
to
seven
my
gentleman
come
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
profession
of
the
law
we
get
somehow
quite
remarkably
mix
up
with
ugly
people
,
blackguard
people
,
and
dirty
people
.
<EOS>
but
far
away
the
ugly
and
dirty
blackguard
I
ever
see
in
my
life
be
Mr.
Alfred
Davager
.
<EOS>
He
have
greasy
white
hair
and
a
mottled
face
.
<EOS>
He
be
low
in
the
forehead
,
fat
in
the
stomach
,
hoarse
in
the
voice
,
and
weak
in
the
leg
.
<EOS>
both
his
eye
be
bloodshot
,
and
one
be
fix
in
his
head
.
<EOS>
He
smell
of
spirit
,
and
carry
a
toothpick
in
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
"
how
be
you
?
<EOS>
I
have
just
do
dinner
,
"
say
he
;
and
he
light
a
cigar
,
sit
down
with
his
leg
cross
,
and
wink
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
try
at
first
to
take
the
measure
of
him
in
a
wheedling
,
confidential
way
;
but
it
be
no
good
.
<EOS>
I
ask
him
,
in
a
facetious
,
smile
manner
,
how
he
have
get
hold
of
the
letter
.
<EOS>
He
only
tell
me
in
answer
that
he
have
be
in
the
confidential
employment
of
the
writer
of
it
,
and
that
he
have
always
be
famous
since
infancy
for
a
sharp
eye
to
his
own
interest
.
<EOS>
I
pay
him
some
compliment
;
but
he
be
not
to
be
flatter
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
make
him
lose
his
temper
;
but
he
keep
it
in
spite
of
me
.
<EOS>
It
end
in
his
drive
me
to
my
last
resource
 
<EOS>
I
make
an
attempt
to
frighten
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
before
we
say
a
word
about
the
money
,
"
I
begin
,
"
let
me
put
a
case
,
Mr.
Davager
.
<EOS>
the
pull
you
have
on
Mr.
Francis
Gatliffe
be
,
that
you
can
hinder
his
marriage
on
Wednesday
.
<EOS>
now
,
suppose
I
have
get
a
magistrate
's
warrant
to
apprehend
you
in
my
pocket
?
<EOS>
suppose
I
have
a
constable
to
execute
it
in
the
next
room
?
<EOS>
suppose
I
bring
you
up
to
-
morrow
 
<EOS>
the
day
before
the
marriage
 
charge
you
only
generally
with
an
attempt
to
extort
money
,
and
apply
for
a
day
's
remand
to
complete
the
case
?
<EOS>
suppose
,
as
a
suspicious
stranger
,
you
can
not
get
bail
in
this
town
?
<EOS>
suppose
"
  
<EOS>
"
stop
a
bit
,
"
say
Mr.
Davager
.
<EOS>
"
suppose
I
should
not
be
the
green
fool
that
ever
stand
in
shoe
?
<EOS>
suppose
I
should
not
carry
the
letter
about
me
?
<EOS>
suppose
I
should
have
give
a
certain
envelope
to
a
certain
friend
of
mine
in
a
certain
place
in
this
town
?
<EOS>
suppose
the
letter
should
be
inside
that
envelope
,
direct
to
old
Gatliffe
,
side
by
side
with
a
copy
of
the
letter
direct
to
the
editor
of
the
local
paper
?
<EOS>
suppose
my
friend
should
be
instruct
to
open
the
envelope
,
and
take
the
letter
to
their
right
address
,
if
I
do
not
appear
to
claim
them
from
him
this
evening
?
<EOS>
in
short
,
my
dear
sir
,
suppose
you
be
bear
yesterday
,
and
suppose
I
be
not
?
"
say
Mr.
Davager
,
and
wink
at
me
again
.
  
<EOS>
He
do
not
take
me
by
surprise
,
for
I
never
expect
that
he
have
the
letter
about
him
.
<EOS>
I
make
a
pretense
of
be
very
much
take
aback
,
and
of
be
quite
ready
to
give
in
.
<EOS>
We
settle
our
business
about
deliver
the
letter
,
and
hand
over
the
money
,
in
no
time

<EOS>
I
be
to
draw
out
a
document
,
which
he
be
to
sign
.
<EOS>
He
know
the
document
be
stuff
and
nonsense
,
just
as
well
as
I
do
,
and
tell
me
I
be
only
propose
it
to
swell
my
client
's
bill
.
<EOS>
sharp
as
he
be
,
he
be
wrong
there
.
<EOS>
the
document
be
not
to
be
draw
out
to
gain
money
from
Mr.
Frank
,
but
to
gain
time
from
Mr.
Davager
.
<EOS>
It
serve
me
as
an
excuse
to
put
off
the
payment
of
the
five
hundred
pound
till
three
o'clock
on
the
Tuesday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
the
Tuesday
morning
Mr.
Davager
say
he
should
devote
to
his
amusement
,
and
ask
me
what
sight
be
to
be
see
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
tell
him
,
he
pitch
his
toothpick
into
my
grate
,
yawn
,
and
go
out
.
  
<EOS>
I
ring
the
bell
once
 
wait
till
he
have
pass
the
window
 
and
then
look
after
Tom
.
<EOS>
there
be
my
jewel
of
a
boy
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
,
just
set
his
top
go
in
the
most
playful
manner
possible
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Davager
walk
away
up
the
street
toward
the
market
-
place
.
<EOS>
Tom
whip
his
top
up
the
street
toward
the
market
-
place
,
too
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
come
back
,
with
all
his
evidence
collect
in
a
beautifully
clear
and
compact
state
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Davager
have
walk
to
a
public
-
house
just
outside
the
town
,
in
a
lane
lead
to
the
highroad
.
<EOS>
on
a
bench
outside
the
public
-
house
there
sit
a
man
smoke
.
<EOS>
He
say
"
all
right
?
"
and
give
a
letter
to
Mr.
Davager
,
who
answer
"
all
right
!
"
and
walk
back
to
the
inn
.
<EOS>
in
the
hall
he
order
hot
rum
-
and
-
water
,
cigar
,
slipper
,
and
a
fire
to
be
light
in
his
room
.
<EOS>
after
that
he
go
upstairs
,
and
Tom
come
away
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
see
my
road
clear
before
me
 
not
very
far
on
,
but
still
clear
.
<EOS>
I
have
house
the
letter
,
in
all
probability
for
that
night
,
at
the
Gatliffe
Arms
.
<EOS>
after
tip
Tom
,
I
give
him
direction
to
play
about
the
door
of
the
inn
,
and
refresh
himself
when
he
be
tired
at
the
tart
-
shop
opposite
,
eat
as
much
as
he
please
,
on
the
understanding
that
he
cram
all
the
time
with
his
eye
on
the
window
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Davager
go
out
,
or
Mr.
Davager
's
friend
call
on
him
,
Tom
be
to
let
me
know
.
<EOS>
He
be
also
to
take
a
little
note
from
me
to
the
head
chambermaid
 
an
old
friend
of
mine
 
ask
her
to
step
over
to
my
office
,
on
a
private
matter
of
business
,
as
soon
as
her
work
be
do
for
that
night
.
<EOS>
after
settle
these
little
matter
,
have
half
an
hour
to
spare
,
I
turn
to
and
do
myself
a
bloater
at
the
office
fire
,
and
have
a
drop
of
gin
-
and
-
water
hot
,
and
feel
comparatively
happy
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
head
chambermaid
come
,
it
turn
out
,
as
good
luck
would
have
it
,
that
Mr.
Davager
have
draw
her
attention
rather
too
closely
to
his
ugliness
,
by
offer
her
a
testimony
of
his
regard
in
the
shape
of
a
kiss
.
<EOS>
I
no
sooner
mention
him
than
she
fly
into
a
passion
;
and
when
I
add
,
by
way
of
clinch
the
matter
,
that
I
be
retain
to
defend
the
interest
of
a
very
beautiful
and
deserve
young
lady
(
name
not
refer
to
,
of
course
)
against
the
most
cruel
underhand
treachery
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Davager
,
the
head
chambermaid
be
ready
to
go
any
length
that
she
could
safely
to
serve
my
cause
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
word
I
discover
that
boot
be
to
call
Mr.
Davager
at
eight
the
next
morning
,
and
be
to
take
his
clothe
downstairs
to
brush
as
usual
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
D
 
have
not
empty
his
own
pocket
overnight
,
we
arrange
that
boot
be
to
forget
to
empty
them
for
him
,
and
be
to
bring
the
clothe
downstairs
just
as
he
find
them
.
<EOS>
if
Mr.
D
#
#
#
#
's
pocket
be
empty
,
then
,
of
course
,
it
would
be
necessary
to
transfer
the
search
process
to
Mr.
D
#
#
#
#
's
room
.
<EOS>
under
any
circumstance
,
I
be
certain
of
the
head
chambermaid
;
and
under
any
circumstance
,
also
,
the
head
chambermaid
be
certain
of
boot
.
  
<EOS>
I
wait
till
Tom
come
home
,
look
very
puffy
and
bilious
about
the
face
;
but
<EOS>
as
to
his
intellect
,
if
anything
,
rather
sharp
than
ever
.
<EOS>
His
report
be
uncommonly
short
and
pleasant
.
<EOS>
the
inn
be
shut
up
;
Mr.
Davager
be
go
to
bed
in
rather
a
drunken
condition
;
Mr.
Davager
's
friend
have
never
appear
.
<EOS>
I
send
Tom
(
properly
instruct
about
keep
our
man
in
view
all
the
next
morning
)
to
his
shake
-
down
behind
the
office
-
desk
,
where
I
hear
him
hiccough
half
the
night
,
as
even
the
good
boy
will
,
when
over
-
excite
and
too
full
of
tart
.
  
<EOS>
at
half
-
past
seven
next
morning
,
I
slip
quietly
into
boot
's
pantry
.
  
<EOS>
Down
come
the
clothe
.
<EOS>
no
pocket
in
trouser
.
<EOS>
Waistcoat
-
pocket
empty
.
<EOS>
coat

<EOS>
first
,
handkerchief
;
secondly
,
bunch
of
key
;
thirdly
,
cigar
-
case
;
fourthly
,
pocketbook
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
be
not
such
a
fool
as
to
expect
to
find
the
letter
there
,
but
I
open
the
pocketbook
with
a
certain
curiosity
,
notwithstanding
.
  
<EOS>
nothing
in
the
two
pocket
of
the
book
but
some
old
advertisement
cut
out
of
newspaper
,
a
lock
of
hair
tie
round
with
a
dirty
bit
of
ribbon
,
a
circular
letter
about
a
loan
society
,
and
some
copy
of
verse
not
likely
to
suit
any
company
that
be
not
of
an
extremely
free
-
and
-
easy
description
.
<EOS>
on
the
leave
of
the
pocketbook
,
people
's
address
scrawl
in
pencil
,
and
bet
jot
down
in
red
ink
.
<EOS>
on
one
leaf
,
by
itself
,
this
queer
inscription
:
  
"
MEM
.
5
along
.
<EOS>
4
acros
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
understand
everything
but
those
word
and
figure
,
so
of
course
I
copy
them
out
into
my
own
book
.
  
<EOS>
then
I
wait
in
the
pantry
till
boot
have
brush
the
clothe
,
and
have
take
them
upstairs
.
<EOS>
His
report
when
he
come
down
be
,
that
Mr.
D
 
have
ask
if
it
be
a
fine
morning
.
<EOS>
be
tell
that
it
be
,
he
have
order
breakfast
at
nine
,
and
a
saddle
-
horse
to
be
at
the
door
at
ten
,
to
take
him
to
Grimwith
Abbey
 
<EOS>
one
of
the
sight
in
our
neighborhood
which
I
have
tell
him
of
the
evening
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
here
,
come
in
by
the
back
way
,
at
half
-
past
ten
,
"
say
I
to
the
head
chambermaid
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
for
?
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
take
the
responsibility
of
make
Mr.
Davager
's
bed
off
your
hand
for
this
morning
only
,
"
say
I.
  
"
any
more
order
?
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
one
more
,
"
say
i.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
hire
Sam
for
the
morning
.
<EOS>
put
it
down
in
the
order
-
book
that
he
be
to
be
bring
round
to
my
office
at
ten
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
case
you
should
think
Sam
be
a
man
,
I
would
better
perhaps
tell
you
he
be
a
pony
.
<EOS>
I
would
make
up
my
mind
that
it
would
be
beneficial
to
Tom
's
health
,
after
the
 
tart
,
if
he
take
a
constitutional
airing
on
a
nice
hard
saddle
in
the
direction
of
Grimwith
Abbey
.
  
<EOS>
"
anything
else
?
"
say
the
head
chambermaid
.
  
<EOS>
"
only
one
more
favor
,
"
say
I.
"
<EOS>
Would
my
boy
Tom
be
very
much
in
the
way
if
he
come
,
from
now
till
ten
,
to
help
with
the
boot
and
shoe
,
and
stand
at
his
work
close
by
this
window
which
look
out
on
the
staircase
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
a
bit
,
"
say
the
head
chambermaid
.
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
"
say
I
;
and
step
back
to
my
office
directly
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
send
Tom
off
to
help
with
the
boot
and
shoe
,
I
review
the
whole
case
exactly
as
it
stand
at
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
three
thing
Mr.
Davager
may
do
with
the
letter
.
<EOS>
He
may
give
it
to
his
friend
again
before
ten
 
in
which
case
Tom
would
most
likely
see
the
say
friend
on
the
stair
.
<EOS>
He
may
take
it
to
his
friend
,
or
to
some
other
friend
,
after
ten
 
in
which
case
Tom
be
ready
to
follow
him
on
Sam
the
pony
.
<EOS>
and
,
lastly
,
he
may
leave
it
hide
somewhere
in
his
room
at
the
inn
 
in
which
case
I
be
all
ready
for
him
with
a
search
-
warrant
of
my
own
granting
,
under
favor
always
of
my
friend
the
head
chambermaid
.
<EOS>
so
far
I
have
my
business
arrangement
all
gather
up
nice
and
compact
in
my
own
hand
.
<EOS>
only
two
thing
bother
me
;
the
terrible
shortness
of
the
time
at
my
disposal
,
in
case
I
fail
in
my
first
experiment
,
for
get
hold
of
the
letter
,
and
that
queer
inscription
which
I
have
copy
out
of
the
pocketbook
:
  
"
MEM
.
5
along
.
<EOS>
4
acros
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
measurement
most
likely
of
something
,
and
he
be
afraid
of
forget
it
;
therefore
it
be
something
important
.
<EOS>
Query
 
something
about
himself
?
<EOS>
say
"
5
"
(
inch
)
"
along
"
 
h
e
do
not
wear
a
wig
.
<EOS>
say
"
5
"
(
foot
)
"
along
"
 
i
t
can
not
be
coat
,
waistcoat
,
trouser
,
or
underclothing
.
<EOS>
say
"
5
"
(
yard
)
"
along
"
 
i
t
can
not
be
anything
about
himself
,
unless
he
wear
round
his
body
the
rope
that
he
be
sure
to
be
hang
with
one
of
these
day
.
<EOS>
then
it
be
not
something
about
himself
.
<EOS>
what
do
I
know
of
that
be
important
to
him
besides
?
<EOS>
I
know
of
nothing
but
the
letter
.
<EOS>
Can
the
memorandum
be
connect
with
that
?
<EOS>
say
,
yes
.
<EOS>
what
do
"
5
along
"
and
"
4
across
"
mean
,
then
?
<EOS>
the
measurement
of
something
he
carry
about
with
him
?
<EOS>
or
the
measurement
of
something
in
his
room
?
<EOS>
I
could
get
pretty
satisfactorily
to
myself
as
far
as
that
;
but
I
could
get
no
further
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
come
back
to
the
office
,
and
report
him
mount
for
his
ride
.
<EOS>
His
friend
have
never
appear
.
<EOS>
I
send
the
boy
off
,
with
his
proper
instruction
,
on
Sam
's
back
 
write
an
encouraging
letter
to
Mr.
Frank
to
keep
him
quiet
 
then
slip
into
the
inn
by
the
back
way
a
little
before
half
-
past
ten
.
<EOS>
the
head
chambermaid
give
me
a
signal
when
the
landing
be
clear
.
<EOS>
I
get
into
his
room
without
a
soul
<EOS>
but
her
see
me
,
and
lock
the
door
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
the
case
be
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
simplify
now
.
<EOS>
either
Mr.
Davager
have
ride
out
with
the
letter
about
him
,
or
he
have
leave
it
in
some
safe
hiding
-
place
in
his
room
.
<EOS>
I
suspect
it
to
be
in
his
room
,
for
a
reason
that
will
a
little
astonish
you
 
his
trunk
,
<EOS>
his
dressing
-
case
,
and
all
the
drawer
and
cupboard
,
be
leave
open
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
customer
,
and
I
think
this
extraordinary
carelessness
on
his
part
rather
suspicious
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Davager
have
take
one
of
the
good
bedroom
at
the
Gatliffe
Arms
.
<EOS>
Floor
carpet
all
over
,
wall
beautifully
paper
,
four
-
poster
,
and
general
furniture
first
-
rate
.
<EOS>
I
search
,
to
begin
with
,
on
the
usual
plan
,
examine
everything
in
every
possible
way
,
and
take
more
than
an
hour
about
it
.
<EOS>
no
discovery
.
<EOS>
then
I
pull
out
a
carpenter
's
rule
which
I
have
bring
with
me
.
<EOS>
be
there
anything
in
the
room
which
 
either
in
inch
,
foot
,
or
yard
 
answer
to
"
5
along
"
and
"
4
across
"
?
<EOS>
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
put
the
rule
back
in
my
pocket
 
<EOS>
measurement
be
no
good
,
evidently
.
<EOS>
be
there
anything
in
the
room
that
would
count
up
to
5
one
way
and
4
another
,
see
that
nothing
would
measure
up
to
it
?
<EOS>
I
have
get
obstinately
persuade
by
this
time
that
the
letter
must
be
in
the
room
 
principally
because
of
the
trouble
I
have
have
in
look
after
it
.
<EOS>
and
persuade
myself
of
that
,
I
take
it
into
my
head
next
,
just
as
obstinately
,
that
"
5
along
"
and
"
4
across
"
must
be
the
right
clew
to
find
the
letter
by
 
principally
because
I
have
not
leave
myself
,
after
all
my
search
and
think
,
even
so
much
as
the
ghost
of
another
guide
to
go
by
.
<EOS>
"
five
along
"
 
w
here
<EOS>
could
I
count
five
along
the
room
,
in
any
part
of
it
?
  
<EOS>
not
on
the
paper
.
<EOS>
the
pattern
there
be
pillar
of
trellis
-
work
and
flower
,
inclose
a
plain
green
ground
 
only
four
pillar
along
the
wall
and
only
two
across
.
<EOS>
the
furniture
?
<EOS>
there
be
not
five
chair
or
five
separate
piece
of
any
furniture
in
the
room
altogether
.
<EOS>
the
fringe
that
hang
from
the
cornice
of
the
bed
?
<EOS>
plenty
of
them
,
at
any
rate
!
<EOS>
up
I
jump
on
the
counterpane
,
with
my
pen
-
knife
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
every
way
that
"
5

oh

Lord

<EOS>
how
the
time
do
get
on
in
Mr.
Davager
's
room
that
morning
.
  
<EOS>
I
jump
down
from
the
bed
,
so
desperate
at
my
ill
luck
that
I
hardly
care
whether
anybody
hear
me
or
not

<EOS>
quite
a
little
cloud
of

rise
at

they

on

<EOS>
"
Hullo

<EOS>
nice

<EOS>
"

Carpet

<EOS>
I
have
be
jump
up
on
the
bed
,
and
stare
up
at
the
wall
,
but
I
have
never
so
much
as
give
a
glance
down
at
the
carpet
.
<EOS>
think
of
me
pretend
to
be
a
lawyer
,
and
not
know
how
to
look
low
enough
!
  
<EOS>
the
carpet
!
<EOS>
It
have
be
a
stout
article
in
its
time
,
have
evidently
begin
in
a
drawing
-
room
;
then
descend
to
a
coffee
-
room
;
then
go
upstairs
altogether
to
a
bedroom
.
<EOS>
the
ground
be
brown
,
and
the
pattern
be
bunche
of
leave
and
rose
speckle
over
the
ground
at
regular
distance
.
<EOS>
I
reckon
up
the
bunche
.
<EOS>
ten
along
the
room
 
eight
across
it
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
step
out
five
one
way
and
four
the
other
,
and
be
down
on
my
knee
on
the
center
bunch
,
as
true
as
I
sit
on
this
chair
<EOS>
I
could
hear
my
own
heart
beat
so
loud
that
it
quite
frighten
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
narrowly
all
over
the
bunch
,
and
I
feel
all
over
it
with
the
end
of
my
finger
,
and
nothing
come
of
that
.
<EOS>
then
I
scrape
it
over
slowly
and
gently
with
my
nail
.
<EOS>
My
second
finger
-
nail
stick
a
little
at
one
place
.
<EOS>
I
part
the
pile
of
the
carpet
over
that
place
,
and
see
a
thin
slit
which
have
be
hide
by
the
pile
be
smooth
over
it
 
a
slit
about
half
an
inch
long
,
with
a
little
end
of
brown
thread
,
exactly
the
color
of
the
carpet
ground
,
stick
out
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
from
the
middle
of
it
.
<EOS>
just
as
I
lay
hold
of
the
thread
gently
,
I
hear
a
footstep
outside
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
only
the
head
chambermaid
.
<EOS>
"
have
not
you
do
yet
?
<EOS>
"
she
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
give
me
two
minute
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
do
not
let
anybody
come
near
the
door
 
whatever
you
do
,
do
not
let
anybody
startle
me
again
by
come
near
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
take
a
little
pull
at
the
thread
,
and
hear
something
rustle
.
<EOS>
I
take
a
long
pull
,
and
out
come
a
piece
of
paper
,
roll
up
tight
like
those
candle
-
lighter
that
the
lady
make
.
<EOS>
I
unroll
it
 
and
,
by
George
!
<EOS>
there
be
the
letter
!
  
<EOS>
the
original
letter
!
<EOS>
I
know
it
by
the
color
of
the
ink
.
<EOS>
the
letter
that
be
worth
five
hundred
pound
to
me
!
<EOS>
It
be
all
that
I
could
do
to
keep
myself
at
first
from
throw
my
hat
into
the
air
,
and
hurrah
like
mad
.
<EOS>
I
have
to
take
a
chair
and
sit
quiet
in
it
for
a
minute
or
two
,
before
I
could
cool
myself
down
to
my
proper
business
level
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
be
safely
down
again
when
I
find
myself
ponder
how
to
let
Mr.
Davager
know
that
he
have
be
do
by
the
innocent
country
attorney
,
after
all
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
before
a
nice
little
irritating
plan
occur
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
tear
a
blank
leaf
out
of
my
pocketbook
,
write
on
it
with
my
pencil
,
"
change
for
a
five
-
hundred
-
pound
note
,
"
fold
up
the
paper
,
tie
the
thread
to
it
,
poke
it
back
into
the
hiding
-
place
,
smooth
over
the
pile
of
the
carpet
,
and
then
bolt
off
to
Mr.
Frank
.
<EOS>
He
in
his
turn
bolt
off
to
show
the
letter
to
the
young
lady
,
who
first
certify
to
its
genuineness
,
then
drop
it
into
the
fire
,
and
then
take
the
initiative
for
the
first
time
since
her
marriage
engagement
,
by
fling
her
arm
round
his
neck
,
kiss
him
with
all
her
might
,
and
go
into
hysteric
in
his
arm
.
<EOS>
so
at
least
Mr.
Frank
tell
me
,
but
that
be
not
evidence
.
<EOS>
It
be
evidence
,
however
,
that
I
see
them
married
with
my
own
eye
on
the
Wednesday
;
and
that
while
they
go
off
in
a
carriage
-
and
-
four
to
spend
the
honeymoon
,
I
go
off
on
my
own
leg
to
open
a
credit
at
the
Town
and
County
Bank
with
a
five
-
hundred
-
pound
note
in
my
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
Mr.
Davager
,
I
can
tell
you
nothing
more
about
him
,
except
what
be
derive
from
hearsay
evidence
,
which
be
always
unsatisfactory
evidence
,
even
in
a
lawyer
's
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
My
inestimable
boy
,
Tom
,
although
twice
kick
off
by
Sam
the
pony
,
never
lose
hold
of
the
bridle
,
and
keep
his
man
in
sight
from
first
to
last
.
<EOS>
He
have
nothing
particular
to
report
except
that
on
the
way
out
to
the
Abbey
Mr.
Davager
have
stop
at
the
public
-
house
,
have
speak
a
word
or
two
to
his
friend
of
the
night
before
,
and
have
hand
him
what
look
like
a
bit
of
paper
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
doubt
a
clew
to
the
thread
that
hold
the
letter
,
to
be
use
in
case
of
accident
.
<EOS>
in
every
other
respect
Mr.
D.
have
ride
out
and
ride
in
like
an
ordinary
sightseer
.
<EOS>
Tom
report
him
to
me
as
have
dismount
at
the
hotel
about
two
.
<EOS>
at
half
-
past
I
lock
my
office
door
,
nail
a
card
under
the
knocker
with
"
not
at
home
till
to
-
morrow
"
write
on
it
,
and
retire
to
a
friend
's
house
a
mile
or
so
out
of
the
town
for
the
rest
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Davager
,
I
have
be
since
give
to
understand
,
leave
the
Gatliffe
Arms
that
same
night
with
his
good
clothe
on
his
back
,
and
with
all
the
valuable
content
of
his
dressing
-
case
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
in
a
condition
to
state
whether
he
ever
go
through
the
form
of
ask
for
his
bill
or
not
;
but
I
can
positively
testify
that
he
never
pay
it
,
and
that
the
effect
leave
in
his
bedroom
do
not
pay
it
either
.
<EOS>
when
I
add
to
these
fragment
of
evidence
that
he
and
I
have
never
meet
(
luckily
for
me
,
you
will
say
)
since
I
jockey
him
out
of
his
banknote
,
I
have
about
fulfil
my
imply
contract
as
maker
of
a
statement
with
you
,
sir
,
as
hearer
of
a
statement
.
<EOS>
observe
the
expression
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
I
say
it
be
a
Statement
before
I
begin
;
and
I
say
it
be
a
Statement
<EOS>
now
I
have
do
.
<EOS>
I
defy
you
to
prove
it
be
a
Story
!
<EOS>
how
be
you
get
on
with
my
portrait
?
<EOS>
I
like
you
very
well
,
Mr.
Artist
;
but
if
you
have
be
take
advantage
of
my
talking
to
shirk
your
work
,
as
sure
as
you
be
alive
<EOS>
I
will
split
upon
you
to
the
Town
Council
!
  
<EOS>
I
attend
a
great
many
time
at
my
queer
sitter
's
house
before
his
likeness
be
complete
.
<EOS>
to
the
last
he
be
dissatisfy
with
the
progress
I
make
.
<EOS>
fortunately
for
me
,
the
Town
Council
approve
of
the
portrait
when
it
be
do
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boxsious
,
however
,
object
to
them
as
be
much
too
easy
to
please
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
dispute
the
fidelity
of
the
likeness
,
but
he
assert
that
I
have
not
cover
the
canvas
with
half
paint
enough
for
my
money
.
<EOS>
to
this
day
(
for
he
be
still
alive
)
,
he
describe
me
to
all
inquire

as

<EOS>
PROLOGUE
to
the
third
story
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
sad
day
for
me
when
Mr.
Lanfray
,
of
Rockleigh
Place
,
discover
that
his
young
daughter
's
health
require
a
warm
climate
,
remove
from
his
english
establishment
to
the
South
of
France
.
<EOS>
rove
from
place
to
place
,
as
I
be
oblige
to
do
,
though
I
make
many
acquaintance
,
I
keep
but
few
friend
.
<EOS>
the
nature
of
my
calling
be
,
I
be
quite
aware
,
mainly
answerable
for
this
.
<EOS>
People
can
not
be
blame
for
forget
a
man
who
,
on
leave
their
house
,
never
can
tell
them
for
certain
when
he
be
likely
to
be
in
their
neighborhood
again
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Lanfray
be
one
of
the
few
exceptional
person
who
always
remember
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
proof
of
his
friendly
interest
in
my
welfare
in
the
shape
of
letter
which
I
treasure
with
grateful
care
.
<EOS>
the
last
of
these
be
an
invitation
to
his
house
in
the
South
of
France
.
<EOS>
there
be
little
chance
at
present
of
my
be
able
to
profit
by
his
kindness
;
but
I
like
to
read
his
invitation
from
time
to
time
,
for
it
make
me
fancy
,
in
my
happy
moment
,
that
I
may
one
day
really
be
able
to
accept
it
.
  
<EOS>
My
introduction
to
this
gentleman
,
in
my
capacity
of
portrait
-
painter
,
do
not
promise
much
for
me
in
a
professional
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
I
be
invite
to
Rockleigh
 
or
to
"
the
Place
,
"
as
it
be
more
frequently
call
among
the
people
of
the
county
 
to
take
a
likeness
in
water
-
color
,
on
a
small
scale
,
of
the
french
governess
who
live
with
Mr.
Lanfray
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
My
first
idea
on
hearing
of
this
be
,
that
the
governess
be
about
to
leave
her
situation
,
and
that
her
pupil
wish
to
have
a
memorial
of
her
in
the
shape
of
a
portrait
.
<EOS>
subsequent
inquiry
,
however
,
inform
me
that
I
be
in
error
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
eld
of
Mr.
Lanfray
's
daughter
,
who
be
on
the
point
of
leave
the
house
to
accompany
her
husband
to
India
;
and
it
be
for
her
that
the
portrait
have
be
order
as
a
home
remembrance
of
her
good
and
dear
friend
.
<EOS>
besides
these
particular
,
I
discover
that
the
governess
,
though
still
call
"
mademoiselle
,
"
be
an
old
lady
;
that
Mr.
Lanfray
have
be
introduce
to
her
many
year
since
in
France
,
after
the
death
of
his
wife
;
that
she
be
absolute
mistress
in
the
house
;
and
that
her
three
pupil
have
always
look
up
to
her
as
a
second
mother
,
from
the
time
when
their
father
first
place
them
under
her
charge
.
  
<EOS>
these
scrap
of
information
make
me
rather
anxious
to
see
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
,
the
governess
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
day
appoint
for
my
attendance
at
the
comfortable
country
house
of
Rockleigh
,
I
be
detain
on
the
road
,
and
do
not
arrive
at
my
destination
until
late
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
the
welcome
accord
to
me
by
Mr.
Lanfray
<EOS>
give
an
earnest
of
the
unvarying
kindness
that
I
be
to
experience
at
his
hand
in
after
-
life
.
<EOS>
I
be
receive
at
once
on
equal
term
,
as
if
I
have
be
a
friend
of
the
family
,
and
be
present
the
same
evening
to
my
host
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
merely
three
elegant
and
attractive
young
woman
,
but
 
what
mean
much
more
than
that
 
three
admirable
subject
for
picture
,
the
bride
particularly
.
<EOS>
Her
young
husband
do
not
strike
me
much
at
first
sight
;
he
seem
rather
shy
and
silent
.
<EOS>
after
I
have
be
introduce
to
him
,
I
look
round
for
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
,
but
she
be
not
present
;
and
I
be
soon
afterward
inform
by
Mr.
Lanfray
that
she
always
spend
the
latter
part
of
the
evening
in
her
own
room
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
breakfast
-
table
the
next
morning
,
I
again
look
for
my
sitter
,
and
once
more
in
vain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mamma
,
as
we
call
her
,
"
say
one
of
the
lady
,
"
be
dress
expressly
for
her
picture
,
Mr.
Kerby
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
be
not
above
paint
silk
,
lace
,
and
jewelry
.
<EOS>
the
dear
old
lady
,
who
be
perfection
in
everything
else
,
be
perfection
also
in
dress
,
and
be
bent
on
be
paint
in
all
her
splendor
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
explanation
prepare
me
for
something
extraordinary
;
but
I
find
that
my
anticipation
have
fall
far
below
the
reality
when
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
at
last
make
her
appearance
,
and
announce
that
she
be
ready
to
sit
for
her
portrait
.
  
<EOS>
never
before
or
since
have
I
see
such
perfect
dressing
and
such
active
old
age
in
combination
.
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
"
be
short
and
thin
;
her
face
be
perfectly
white
all
over
,
the
skin
be
pucker
up
in
an
infinite
variety
of
the
small
possible
wrinkle
.
<EOS>
Her
bright
black
eye
be
perfect
marvel
of
youthfulness
and
vivacity
.
<EOS>
They
sparkle
,
and
beam
,
and
ogle
,
and
move
about
over
everybody
and
everything
at
such
a
rate
,
that
the
plain
gray
hair
above
them
look
unnaturally
venerable
,
and
the
wrinkle
below
an
artful
piece
of
masquerade
to
represent
old
age
.
<EOS>
as
for
her
dress
,
I
remember
few
hard
piece
of
work
than
the
painting
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
wear
a
silver
-
gray
silk
gown
that
seem
always
flash
out
into
some
new
light
whenever
she
move
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
stiff
as
a
board
,
and
rustle
like
the
wind
.
<EOS>
Her
head
,
neck
,
and
bosom
be
envelop
in
cloud
of
the
airy
-
look
lace
I
ever
see
,
dispose
about
each
part
of
her
with
the
most
exquisite
grace
and
propriety
,
and
glisten
at
all
sort
of
unexpected
place
with

the

here
she
drop
me
another
brisk
courtesy
,
place
herself
in
a
languish
position
in
the
sitter
's
chair
,
and
ask
us
all
if
she
look
like
a
shepherdess
in
Dresden

<EOS>
the
young

burst
out
laugh

mademoiselle

as
gay
as
any

a
great

shriller

join
in
the
merriment

<EOS>
never
before
have
I
contend
with
any

half
as
restless
as
that
wonderful
old
lady

<EOS>
no
sooner
have
I
begin
than
she
jump
out
of
the
chair
,
and
exclaim
,
"
Grand
Dieu

I
have
forget
to
embrace
my

this
morning

run
up
to
her

raise
herself
on
tiptoe
before
them
in
quick
succession
,
put
the
two
first
finger
of
each
hand
under
their
ear

kiss
them
lightly
on
both
cheek
,
and
be
back
again
in

an
english
governess
could
have
say

back

come

work
from

for
five
minute
at
the
most
.
"

<EOS>
cry
mademoiselle

jump
up
for

"
  
<EOS>
for
the
fourth

I
begin
,

for
the
fourth
time
the
old
lady
start
out
of
her
chair

<EOS>
"
now
I
must
repose
myself
,
"
say
mademoiselle
,
walk
lightly
from
end

end
of

hum
a
french
air

by
way

take
a
rest

<EOS>
I
be
at
my
wit
's
end
,
and
the
young
lady
see
it
.
<EOS>
They
all
surround
my
unmanageable
sitter
,
and
appeal
to
her
compassion
for
me
.
"
<EOS>
certainly
!
"
say
mademoiselle
,
express
astonishment
by
fling
up
both
her
hand
with
all
the
finger
spread
out
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
"
but
why
apostrophize
me
thus
?
<EOS>
I
be
here
,
I
be
ready
,
I
be
at
the
service
of
this
skillful
artist
.
<EOS>
why
apostrophize
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
a
fortunate
chance
question
of
mine
steady
her
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
I
inquire
if
I
be
expect
to
draw
the
whole
of
my
sitter
's
figure
as
well
as
her
face
.
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
reply
by
a
comic
scream
of
indignation
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
the
brave
and
gifted
man
for
whom
she
take
me
,
I
ought
to
be
ready
to
perish
rather
than
leave
out
an
inch
of
her
anywhere
.
<EOS>
Dress
be
her
passion
,
and
it
would
be
an
outrage
on
her
sentiment
if
I
do
not
do
full
justice
to
everything
she
have
on
 
to
her
robe
,
to
her
lace
,
to
her
scarf
,
to
her
fan
,
to
her
ring
,
her
jewel
,
and
,
above
all
,
to
her
bracelet
.
<EOS>
I
groan
in
spirit
at
the
task
before
me
,
but
make
my
good
bow
of
acquiescence
.
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
be
not
to
be
satisfy
by
a
mere
bow
;
she
desire
the
pleasure
of
specially
direct
my
attention
,
if
I
would
be
so
amiable
as
to
get
up
and
approach
her
,
to
one
of
her
bracelet
in
particular
 
<EOS>
the
bracelet
with
the
miniature
,
on
her
left
wrist
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
the
gift
of
the
dear
friend
she
ever
have
,
and
the
miniature
represent
that
friend
's
beloved
and
beautiful
face
.
<EOS>
Could
I
make
a
tiny
,
tiny
copy
of
that
likeness
in
my
drawing
!
<EOS>
Would
I
only
be
so
obliging
as
to
approach
for
one
little
moment
,
and
see
if
such
a
thing
be
possible
?
  
<EOS>
I
obey
unwillingly
enough
,
expect
,
from
mademoiselle
's
expression
,
to
see
a
commonplace
portrait
of
some
unfortunate
admirer
whom
she
have
treat
with
unmerited
severity
in
the
day
of
her
youth
.
<EOS>
to
my
astonishment
,
I
find
that
the
miniature
,
which
be
very
beautifully
paint
,
represent
a
woman
's
face
 
<EOS>
a
young
woman
with
kind
,
sad
eye
,
pale
,
delicate
cheek
,
light
hair
,
and
such
a
pure
,
tender
,
lovely
expression
that
I
think
of
Raphael
's
Madonnas
the
moment
I
look
at
her
portrait
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
lady
observe
the
impression
which
the
miniature
produce
on
me
,
and
nod
her
head
in
silence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
a
beautiful
,
innocent
,
pure
face
!
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
  
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
gently
brush
a
particle
of
dust
from
the
miniature
with
her
handkerchief
,
and
kiss
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
three
angel
still
leave
,
"
she
say
,
look
at
her
pupil
.
<EOS>
"
They
console
me
for
the
fourth
,
who
have
go
to
heaven
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
pat
the
face
on
the
miniature
gently
with
her
little
,
withered
,
white
finger
,
as
if
it
have
be
a
live
thing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sister
Rose
!
"
<EOS>
she
sigh
to
herself
;
then
,
look
up
again
at
me
,
say
,
"
I
should
like
it
put
into
my
portrait
,
sir
,
because
I
have
always
wear
it
since
I
be
a
young
woman
,
for
"
Sister
Rose
's
"
sake
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
sudden
change
in
her
manner
,
from
the
extreme
of
flighty
gayety
to
the
extreme
of
quiet
sadness
,
would
have
look
theatrical
in
a
woman
of
any
other
nation
.
<EOS>
It
seem
,
however
,
perfectly
natural
and
appropriate
in
her
.
<EOS>
I
go
back
to
my
drawing
,
rather
perplexed
.
<EOS>
who
be
"
Sister
Rose
"
?
<EOS>
not
one
of
the
Lanfray
family
,
apparently
.
<EOS>
the
composure
of
the
young
lady
when
the
name
be
mention
show
plainly
enough
that
the
original
of
the
miniature
have
be
no
relation
of
theirs
.
  
<EOS>
I
try
to
stifle
my
curiosity
on
the
subject
of
Sister
Rose
,
by
give
myself
entirely
to
my
work
.
<EOS>
for
a
full
half
-
hour
,
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
sit
quietly
before
me
,
with
her
hand
cross
on
her
lap
,
and
her
eye
fix
on
the
bracelet
.
<EOS>
this
happy
alteration
enable
me
to
do
something
toward
complete
the
outline
of
her
face
and
figure
.
<EOS>
I
may
even
,
under
fortunate
circumstance
,
have
vanquish
the
preliminary
difficulty
of
my
task
at
one
effort
;
but
the
fate
be
against
me
that
day
.
<EOS>
while
I
be
still
work
rapidly
and
to
my
satisfaction
,
a
servant
knock
at
the
door
to
announce
luncheon
,
and
mademoiselle
lightly
rouse
herself
from
her
serious
reflection
and
her
quiet
position
in
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
turn
the
miniature
round
on
her
wrist
till
it
be
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
"
what
animal
we
be
,
after
all
!
<EOS>
the
spiritual
part
of
us
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
stomach

<EOS>
My

absorb
by
tender

<EOS>
with
this
quotation
from
"
Candide

"
plaintively
deliver
,
the
old
lady
lead
the
way
out
of
the
room
,
and
be

by
her
young
pupil
.

the

sister
remain
behind
for
a
moment
,
and
remind
me
that
the
lunch
be
ready

<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
you
have
find
the
dear
old
soul
rather
an
unruly
sitter
,
"
she
say
,
notice
the
look
of
dissatisfaction
with
which
I
be
regard
my
drawing
.
<EOS>
"
but
she
will
improve
as
you
go
on
.
<EOS>
She
have
do
better
already
for
the
last
half
-
hour
,
have
she
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
much
well
,
"
I
answer
.
<EOS>
"
My
admiration
of
the
miniature
on
the
bracelet
seem
 
I
suppose
,
by
call
up
some
old
association
 
to
have
a
strangely
soothing
effect
on
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
yes
!
<EOS>
only
remind
her
of
the
original
of
that
portrait
,
and
you
change
her
directly
,
whatever
she
may
have
be
say
or
do
the
moment
before
.
<EOS>
sometimes
she
talk
of
Sister
Rose
,
and
of
all
that
she
go
through
in
the
time
of
the
French
Revolution
,
by
the
hour
together
.
<EOS>
It
be
wonderfully
interesting
 
at
least
we
all
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
presume
that
the
lady
describe
as
"
Sister
Rose
"
<EOS>
be
a
relation
of
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
's
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
only
a
very
dear
friend
.
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
be
the
daughter
of
a
silk
-
mercer
,
once
establish
at
chalon
-
sur

Marne

<EOS>
Her
father
happen
to
give
an
asylum
in
his
office
to
a
lonely
old
man
,
to
whom
"
Sister
Rose
"
and
her
brother
have
be
greatly
indebte
in
the
revolutionary
time
;
and
out
of
a
train
of
circumstance
connect
with
that
,
the
first
acquaintance
between
mademoiselle
and
the
friend
whose
portrait
she
wear

arise
.
<EOS>
after
the
time
of
her
father
's
bankruptcy
,
and
for
many
year
before
we
be
place
under
her
charge
,
our
good
old
governess
live
entirely
with
"
Sister
Rose
"
and
her
brother

<EOS>
She
must
then
have
hear
all
the
interesting
thing
that
she
have
since
often
repeat
to
my
sister
and
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
may
I
suggest
,
"
say
I
,
after
an
instant
's
consideration
,
"
that
the
good
way
to
give
me
a
fair
chance
of
study
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
's
face
at
the
next
sitting
,
would
be
to
lead
her
thought
again
to
that
quiet
subject
of
the
miniature
,
and
to
the
event
which
the
portrait
recall
?
<EOS>
It
be
really
the
only
plan
,
after
what
I
have
observe
this
morning

that
I
can
think
of
for

me
to
do
myself

justice

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
delighted
to
hear
you
say
so
,

reply
the
lady
;
"
for
the
execution
of
your
plan
,
by
me
or
by
my
sister

will
be
the
easy
thing

a
word
from
us

set
mademoiselle
think
,

talk
too

youthful

on
our
assistance
so
far

now
let
me
show
you
the
way
to
the

"
  
<EOS>
two
good
result
follow
the
ready
rendering
of
the
help
I
have
ask
from
my
host
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
succeed
with
my
portrait
of
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
,
and
I
hear
the
story
which
occupy
the
follow
page
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
case
of
the
precede
narrative
,
I
have
repeat
what
be
relate
to
me
,
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
very
word
of
my
sitter
.
<EOS>
in
the
case
of
this
third
story
,
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
proceed
upon
the
same
plan
.
<EOS>
the
circumstance
of
"
Sister
Rose
's
"
eventful
history
be
narrate
to
me
at
different
time
,
and
in
the
most
fragmentary
and
discursive
manner
.
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
characteristically
mix
up
with
the
direct
interest
of
her
story
,
not
only
reference
to
place
and
people
which
have
no
recognizable
connection
with
it
,
but
outburst
of
passionate
political
declamation
,
on
the
extreme
liberal
side
 
to
say
nothing
of
little
tender
apostrophe
to
her
beloved
friend
,
which
sound
very
prettily
as
she
speak
them
,
but
which
would
lose
their
effect
altogether
by
be
transfer
to
paper
.
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
,
I
have
think
it
best
to
tell
the
story
in
my
own
way
 
rigidly
adhere
to
the
event
of
it
exactly
as
they
be
relate
;
and
never
interfere
on
my
own
responsibility
except
to
keep
order
in
the
march
of

remark
that
the

of

their

on

side

be
all

in

secret
restraint

even
the
expression
of

.
<EOS>
Madame

<EOS>
a
handsome

richly

old

with
very
bright
eye

and
a
quick

suspicious
manner
 
look
composedly
and
happily
enough
,
as
long
as
her
attention
be
fix
on
her
son
.
<EOS>
but
when
she
turn
from
him
toward
the
bride
,
a
hardly
perceptible
uneasiness
pass
over
her
face
 
<EOS>
an
uneasiness
which
only
deepen
to
positive
distrust
and
dissatisfaction
whenever
she
look
toward
Mademoiselle
Trudaine
's
brother
.
<EOS>
in
the
same
way
,
her
son

who

alter
visibly
in

as
his

alter
,
whenever
the
presence
of
Monsieur
Trudaine
specially
impress
itself
on
his
attention

<EOS>
then
,
again
,
Lomaque
,
the
land

steward
 
quiet
,
sharp
,
skinny
Lomaque
,
with
the
submissive
manner
,
and
the
red

rim
eye
 
never
look
up
at
his
master

future
brother
-
in

law
without
look
away
again
rather
uneasily
,
and
thoughtfully
drill
hole
in
the
grass
with
his
long
sharp

point
cane
.
<EOS>
even
the
bride
herself
 
<EOS>

pretty

innocent

,
with
her
childish
shyness

manner
 
seem

<EOS>
doubt
,
if
not
distress
,
overshadow
her
face
from
time
to
time
,
and
the
hand
which
her
lover
hold
tremble
a
little
,
and
grow
restless
,
when
she
accidentally
catch
her
brother
's
eye
.
  
<EOS>
strangely
enough
there
be
nothing
to
repel
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
everything
to
attract
in
the
look
and
manner
of
the
person
whose
mere
presence
seem
to
exercise
such
a
curiously
constraining
influence
over
the
wedding
-
party
.
<EOS>
Louis
Trudaine
be
a
remarkably
handsome
man
.
<EOS>
His
expression
be
singularly
kind
and
gentle
;
his
manner
irresistibly
win
in
its
frank
,
manly
firmness
and
composure
.
<EOS>
His
word
,
when
he
occasionally
speak
,
seem
as
unlikely
to
give
offense
as
his
look
;
for
he
only
open
his
lip
in
courteous
reply
to
question
directly
address
to
him
.
<EOS>
judge
by
a
latent
mournfulness
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
,
and
by
the
sorrowful
tenderness
which
cloud
his
kind
,
earnest
eye
whenever
they
rest
on
his
sister
,
his
thought
be
certainly
not
of
the
happy
or
the
hopeful
kind
.
<EOS>
but
he
give
them
no
direct
expression
;
he
intrude
his
secret
sadness
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
on
no
one
of
his
companion
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
modest
and
self
-
restrained
as
he
be
,
there
be
evidently
some
reprove
or
saddening
influence
in
his
presence
which
affect
the
spirit
of
every
one
near
him
,
and
darken
the
eve
of
the
wedding
to
bride
and
bridegroom
alike
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
sun
slowly
sink
in
the
heavens
,
the
conversation
flag
more
and
more
.
<EOS>
after
a
long
silence
,
the
bridegroom
be
the
first
to
start
a
new
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rose

"
he
say
,
"
that
magnificent

it

nothing

You
will
soon
know
better

to
confound
him

even
in
the
slight
thing

with
the
common

people

<EOS>
all
his
conviction
be
well
found
 
so
well

that
if
I
think
he
really

I
should
most
assuredly
make
up
my

He
turn
round
petulantly

almost
with
the
air
of
a
spoiled
child

to
his
mother

as
he
say
those
word
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
look
fondly

proudly
on
him
the
moment
before

<EOS>
now
her
eye
wander
disconcertedly
from
his
face
;
she
hesitate
an
instant
with
a
sudden
confusion
which
seem
quite
foreign
to
her
character

then
whisper
in
his
ear
,

"
be
I
to
blame

Charles

for
try

make

worthy

Her

take
no

He

sharply

more
confused

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
but
you
have
!
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
such
an
ungracious
sharpness
in
his
voice
,
such
an
outburst
of
petulance
in
his
manner
as
he
speak
,
that
his
mother
give
him
a
warn
touch
on

and
whisper
"
Hush

<EOS>
Monsieur
Lomaque
,
the
land

the
brother

both
glance
searchingly
at
the
bride

as

pass
the
bridegroom

lip

She
seem
to
be
frighten
and
astonish

rather
than
irritated

hurt

<EOS>
a
curious
smile
pucker
up
Lomaque
's
lean
face
,
as
he
look
demurely
down
on
the
ground
,
and
begin
drill
a
fresh
hole
in
the
turf
with
the
sharp
point
of
his
cane

<EOS>
trudaine
turn
aside
quickly
,
and
,
sighing
,
walk
away
a
few
pace
;
then
come
back
,

seem
about

speak

Danville
interrupt
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
pardon
me

Rose

he
say
;

I
be
so
jealous

even
the
appearance

attention

nearly
allow
myself
to
be
irritated

<EOS>
He
kiss
her
hand
very
gracefully
and
tenderly
as
he
make
his
excuse
;
but
there
be
a
latent
expression
in
his
eye
which
be
at
variance
with
the
apparent
spirit
of
his
action

<EOS>
It
be
notice

none

Monsieur

evidently
know
how

She

with
a
bright

affectionate
smile

hear
his
answer

He
nod
,
as
if
to
reassure
her
,
before
he
speak
again
to
Danville
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
rather
romantic
idea
about
experiment
in
chemistry

he
say
,
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
Mine

so
little
connection

the
only
Elixirs
of
Life

both
those

<EOS>
He
speak
with
a
quiet
sadness
in
his
voice
,
which
mean
far
more
to
his
sister
than
the
simple
word
he
utter
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
fill
with
tear
;
she
turn
for
a
moment
from
her
lover
,
and
take
her
brother
's
hand
.

"
do
not

Louis

hurriedly
,
as
he
rise
from
the
seat
and
face
Trudaine
with
undisguised
irritation
and
impatience
in
his
manner

<EOS>
before
he
could
speak
,
the
old
servant
Guillaume
make
his
appearance
,
and
announce
that
coffee

Madame

amazedly

He
control
himself
in

moment

smile
,
and

to
her
:

curious
light
twinkle
in

begin
a
fresh
hole
in

ask
Trudaine

on
the
arm

<EOS>
Monsieur

start
a
little
and
leave
his
cane

in
the
ground

I
confess
the
beauty
of
the
evening

the

this

Lomaque
lay
one
hand
on
his
heart
,
and
with
the
other
pull
his
stick
out
of
the
grass
.
<EOS>
He
have
look
as
little
at
the
landscape
or
the
set
sun
as
Monsieur
Justin
himself

<EOS>
They
sit
down
,
side
by
side
,
on
the
empty
bench
;
and
then
there
follow
an
awkward
pause

<EOS>
Submissive
Lomaque
be
too
discreet
to
forget
his
place

venture
on
start
a
new
topic

<EOS>
Trudaine
be
preoccupy
,
and
disincline
to
talk

<EOS>
It
be
necessary
,
however
,
in
common
politeness
,
to
say
something
.
<EOS>
hardly
attend
himself
to
his
own
word
,
he
begin
with
a
commonplace
phrase
:
"
I
regret
,
Monsieur
Lomaque
,
that
we
have
not
have
more
opportunity
of
better
our
acquaintance
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
deeply
indebted
,
"
rejoin
the
land
-
steward
,
"
to
the
admirable
Madame
Danville
for
have
choose
me
as
her
escort
hither
from
her
son

estate
near
Lyons
,
and
have
thereby
procure
for
me
the
honor
of
this
introduction

<EOS>
both
Monsieur

's
red
-
rimmed
eye
be
seize
with
a
sudden
fit
of
winking
,
as
he
make
this
polite
speech
.
<EOS>
His
enemy
be
accustom
to
say
that
,
whenever
he
be
particularly
insincere
,
or
particularly
deceitful
,
he
always
take
refuge
in
the
weakness
of
his
eye
,
and
so
evade
the
try
ordeal
of
be
oblige
to
look
steadily
at
the
person
whom
he
be
speak
with
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
pleased

<EOS>

I

the

for

your

<EOS>
Your
father

I
believe
,
be
a
merchant
,
just
as
Danville

father
be
a
merchant
;
the
only
difference
between
them
be
that
one
fail
and
the
other
realize
a
large
fortune

why
should
you
speak
of
yourself

<EOS>

have
you

that
Madame

noble

France

often

yes

I

<EOS>
Lomaque

thin

close
instinctively
at
the
question

incessantly

apostrophe

at

end

throw
up

again

inquiringly

objection

fortune

a
distrust

now

You

My

I
be

to
me
on

death

He

still
more
when

on

straight
up

exclamation
from

"
  
<EOS>
Trudaine
smile
and
shake
his
head
;
but
she
take
no
notice
of
the
gesture
of
denial
 
only
stand
look
earnestly
and
wistfully
into
his
face
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
begin
to
fill
;
she
suddenly
throw
her
arm
round
his
neck
,
and
whisper
to
him
:
"
<EOS>

Louis
,
Louis

<EOS>
how
I
wish
I
could

He

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
at
the

moment
there

and
Rose

,
anxious
to
consult
her
mistress
on
some
of
the
preparation

It

of
present
trifle

an
excuse
for

<EOS>
He
sit
down
by

,
doubting
and
heavy

hearted
,
and
place
the
letter
from

over
all
the
complimentary

only
on
these

"
the

in
which
these
line
occur
offer
him
such
a
position
as
in
his
modest
self

distrust
he
have
never
dream
of
before

the
line

contain
the
promise
of
such
vast
facility
for

on
his
favorite
experiment
as
he
could
never
hope
to
command
in
his
own
little

,
with
his

limited

yet

whether

He
pause
for
a
few
minute
,
and
reflect
.
<EOS>
the
thought
that
be
in
him
mark
their
ominous
course
in
the
grow
paleness
of
his

in

dimness
that
steal
over

<EOS>
"
if
this

should
be

I

He

blank
sheet
of

It

It

in
the
most
respectful
term
his
gratitude
for
the
offer

him

his
inability

the
whole

there
stand
Monsieur

;
idly

an
independent

calmly

as

no

responsibility
as
the
calling
of
Madame
Danville

Lomaque
assented
;
but
before

Monsieur

I

pretty
near

mark

You
have

I
fancy
I
can
guess
why

He
pause
thoughtfully
,
and
shake
his

with
ominous
frown
and
biting
of
his
lip

<EOS>
"
all

after
a
while
,
look
up
at
the
lustrous
midday
heaven
.
<EOS>
"
all
clear

I
think
I
see
a
little
cloud
rise
in
a
certain

CHAPTER
I.
  
five
year
have
elapse
since
Monsieur
Lomaque

thoughtfully
at
the
gate
of
Trudaine
's
house
,
look
after
the
carriage
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
,
and
seriously
reflect
on
the
event
of
the
future
.
<EOS>
great
change
have
pass
over
that
domestic
firmament
in
which
he
prophetically
discern
the
little
warning
cloud
.
<EOS>
great
change
have
pass
over
the
firmament
of
France
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
revolt
five
year
ago
be
Revolution
now
 
revolution
which
have
ingulfe
throne
,
and
principality
,
and
power
;
which
have
set
up
crownless
,
inhereditary
king
and
counselor
of
its
own
,
and
have
bloodily
tear
them
down
again
by
dozen
;
which
have
rage
and
rage
on
unrestrainedly
in
fierce
earnest
,
until
but
one
king
can
still
govern
and
control
it
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
that
king
be
name
Terror
,
and
seventeen
hundred
and
ninety
-
four

the
year
of
his
reign
.
  
<EOS>
Monsieur
Lomaque
,

sit
alone
in
an
official
-
look
room
in
one
of
the
official
building
of
Paris
.
<EOS>
It
be
another
July
evening
,
as
fine
as
that
evening
when
he
and
Trudaine
sit
talk
together
on
the
bench
overlook
the
Seine
.
<EOS>
the
window
of
the
room
be
wide
open
,
and
a
faint
,
pleasant
breeze
be
begin
to
flow
through
it
.
<EOS>
but
Lomaque
breathe
uneasily
,
as
if
still
oppress
by
the
sultry
midday
heat
;
and
there
be
sign
of
perplexity
and
trouble
in
his
face
as
he
look
down
absently
now
and
then
into
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
the
time
he
live
in
be
enough
of
themselves
to
sadden
any
man
's
face
.
<EOS>
in
the
Reign
of
Terror
no

all

city
of
Paris

rise
in
the
morning
and
be
certain
of
escape
the
spy
,
the
denunciation
,
the
arrest
,
or
the
guillotine
,
before
night
.
<EOS>
such
time
be
try
enough
to
oppress
any
man
's
spirit
;
but
Lomaque
be
not
think
of
them
or
care
for
them
now
.
<EOS>
out
of
a
mass
of
paper
which
lie
before
him
on
his
old
writing
-
table
,
he
have
just
take
up
and
read
one
,
which
have
carry
his
thought
back
to
the
past
,
and
to
the
change
which
have
take
place
since
he
stand
alone
on
the
doorstep
of
Trudaine
's
house
,
ponder
on
what
may
happen
.
  
<EOS>
more
rapidly
even
than
he
have
forebode
those
change
have
occur
.
<EOS>
in
less
time
even
than
he
have
anticipate
,
the
sad
emergency
for
which
Rose
's
brother
have
prepare
,
as
for
a
barely
possible
calamity
,
overtake
Trudaine
,
and
call
for
all
the
patience
,
the
courage
,
the
self
-
sacrifice
which

<EOS>
by
slow
gradation
downward
,
from

less
disguisedly
almost
day

<EOS>
occasional
slight

end
in
habitual
neglect
;
careless
estrangement
,
turn
to
cool
enmity
;
small
insult
,
which
ripen
evilly
to
great
injury
 
these
be
the
pitiless
sign
which
show
her
that
she
have
risk
all
and
lose
all
while

a
young
woman
 
<EOS>
these
be
the
unmerited
affliction
which
find
her
helpless

and
would
have
leave
her
helpless

but
for
the
ever

present
comfort
and
support
of
her
brother

<EOS>
from
the
first

Trudaine
have
devote
himself
to
meet
such
trial
as

assail
him

and
like
a

he
meet
them
,
in
defiance
alike
of
persecution
from

and
of
insult
from
the

<EOS>
the
hard
task
be
only
lighten
when
,
as

advanced
,
public

begin
to
mingle
itself
with
private
grief

<EOS>
then
absorb
political
necessity
come
as
a
relief
to
domestic
misery

<EOS>
then
it
grow
to
be
the
one
purpose
and
pursuit
of
Danville
's
life
cunningly
to
shape
his
course
so
that
he
may
move
safely
onward
with
the
advance
revolutionary
tide
 
<EOS>
he
care
not
whither
,
as
long
as
he
keep
his

safe

out
of

<EOS>
His
mother
,
inflexibly
true
to
her
old

World
conviction
through
all
peril

may
entreat

may

he
heed
her
not

<EOS>
as
he
have
take
the
false
way
with
his

so
he
be
now
bent
on

<EOS>
the
year
pass
on
;
destroy
change
sweep

like

and
still
Danville
shift
successfully
with
the
shifting
time

<EOS>
the
first
day
of
the
Terror
approach
;
in
public
and
in
private
 
in
high
place
and
in
low
 
each
man
now
suspect
his

.
<EOS>
Crafty
as
Danville
be
,
even
he
fall
under
suspicion
at
last
,
at
headquarters
in
Paris
,
principally
on
his
mother
's
account
.
<EOS>
this
be
his
first
political
failure
;
and
,
in
a
moment
of
thoughtless
rage
and
disappointment
,
he
wreak
the
irritation
cause
by
it
on
Lomaque
.
<EOS>
suspect
himself
,
he
in
turn
suspect
the
land

steward

<EOS>
His

foment
the
suspicion
 
Lomaque
be
dismiss
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
old
time
the
victim
would
have
be
ruin
,
in
the
new
time
he
be
simply
render
eligible
for
a
political
vocation
in
life
.
<EOS>
Lomaque
be
poor
,
quick
-
witted
,
secret
,
not
scrupulous
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
good
patriot
;
he
have
good
patriot
friend
,
plenty
of
ambition
,
a
subtle
,
cat
-
like
courage
,
nothing
to
dread
 
<EOS>
and
he
go
to
Paris
.
<EOS>
there
be
plenty
of
small
chance
there
for
man
of
his
caliber
.
<EOS>
He
wait
for
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
It
come
;
he
make
the
most
of
it
;
attract
favorably
the
notice
of
the
terrible
Fouquier
-
Tinville
;
and
win
his
way
to
a
place
in
the
office
of
the
Secret
Police
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
Danville
's
anger
cool
down
;
he
recover
the
use
of
that
cunning
sense
which
have
hitherto
serve
him
well
,
and
send
to
recall
the
discard
servant
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
Lomaque
be
already
in
a
position
to
set
him
at
defiance
 
nay
,
to
put
his
neck
,
perhaps
,
under
the
blade
of
the
guillotine
.
<EOS>
bad
than
this
,
anonymous
letter
reach
him
,
warn
him
to
lose
no
time
in
prove
his
patriotism
by
some
indisputable
sacrifice
,
and
in
silence
his
mother
,
whose
imprudent
sincerity
be
likely
ere
long
to
cost
her
her
life
.
<EOS>
Danville
know
her
well
enough
to
know
that
there
be
but
one
way
of
save
her
,
and
thereby
save
himself
.
<EOS>
She
have
always
refuse
to
emigrate
;
but
he
now
insist
that
she
should
seize
the
first
opportunity
he
could
procure
for
her
of
quit
France
until
calmer
time
arrive
.
  
<EOS>
probably
she
would
have
risk
her
own
life
ten
time
over
rather
than
have
obey
him
;
but
she
have
not
the
courage
to
risk
her
son
be
too
;
and
she
yield
for
his
sake
.
<EOS>
partly
by
secret
influence
,
partly
by
unblushe
fraud
,
Danville
procure
for
her
such
paper
and
permit
as
would
enable
her
to
leave
France
by
way
of
Marseilles
.
<EOS>
even
then
she
refuse
to
depart
,
until
she
know
what
her
son
's
plan
be
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
He
show
her
a
letter
which
he
be
about
to
dispatch
to
Robespierre
himself
,
vindicate
his
suspect
patriotism
,
and
indignantly
demand
to
be
allow
to
prove
it
by
fill
some
office
,
no
matter
how
small
,
under
the
redoubtable
triumvirate
which
then
govern

or
more
properly
terrify
,
France
.
<EOS>
the
sight
of
this
document
reassure
Madame
Danville
.
<EOS>
She
bid
her
son
farewell
,
and
depart
at
last
,
with
one
trusty
servant
,
for
Marseilles
.
  
<EOS>
Danville
's
intention
,
in
send
his
letter
to
Paris
,
have
be
simply
to
save
himself
by
patriotic
bluster
.
<EOS>
He
be
thunderstruck
at
receive
a
reply
,
take
him
at
his
word
,
and
summon
him
to
the
capital
to
accept
employment
there
under
the
then
exist
Government
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
choice
but
to
obey
.
<EOS>
so
to
Paris
he
journey
,
take
his
wife
with
him
into
the
very
jaws
of
danger
.
<EOS>
He
be
then
at
open
enmity
with
Trudaine
;
and
the
more
anxious
and
alarm
<EOS>
he
could
make
the
brother
feel
on
the
sister
's
account
,
the
well
he
be
pleased
.
<EOS>
true
to
his
trust
and
his
love
,
through
all
danger
as
through
all
persecution
,
Trudaine
follow
them
;
and
the
street
of
their
sojourn
at
Paris
,
in
the
perilous
day
of
the
Terror
,
be
the
street
of
his
sojourn
too
.
  
<EOS>
Danville
have
be
astonish
at
the
acceptance
of
his
proffer
service
;
he
be
still
more
amazed
when
he
find
that
the
post
select
for
him
be
one
of
the
superintendent
's
place
in
that
very
office
of
Secret
Police
in
which
Lomaque
be
employ
as
agent
.
<EOS>
Robespierre
and
his
colleague
have
take
the
measure
of
their
man
 
<EOS>
he
have
money
enough
,
and
local
importance
enough
to
be
worth
study
.
<EOS>
They
know
where
he
be
to
be
distrust
,
and
how
he
may
be
make
useful
.
<EOS>
the
affair
of
the
Secret
Police
be
the
sort
of
affair
which
an
unscrupulously
cunning
man
be
fit
to
help
on
;
and
the
faithful
exercise
of
that
cunning
in
the
service
of
the
State
be
insure
by
the
presence
of
Lomaque
in
the
office
.
<EOS>
the
discard
servant
be
just
the
right
sort
of
spy
to
watch
the
suspect
master
.
<EOS>
thus
it
happen
that
,
in
the
office
of
the
Secret
Police
at
Paris
,
and
under
the
Reign
of
Terror
,

his
master

the
superintendent
to
whom
he

ceremonially
accountable

in

<EOS>
the
suspect
man
,
whose
slight
word
and
deed
he
be
officially
set
to
watch
,
in
private
.
  
<EOS>
ever
sad
and
darker
grow
the
face
of
Lomaque
as
he
now
ponder
alone
over
the
change
and
misfortune
of
the
past
five
year
.
<EOS>
a

from

<EOS>
He
arrange
the
confused
mass
of

before
him
 
look
toward
the

,
as
if
expect
some

then
,
find
himself
still
alone
,
recur
to
the
one
special
paper
which
have
first
suggest
his
long
train
of
gloomy
thought
.
<EOS>
the
few
line
it
contain
be
sign
in
cipher
,
and
run
thus
:

as
he
fold
it
up
and
put

<EOS>
this

<EOS>
He
lean
back
in

beat
his
nail
impatiently
on

<EOS>
suddenly
there

aware
of
his

to
proceed
for
the
third

the
house
in

upon

make
a
remark

like
his

<EOS>
"
when
Citizen

with
that
old
weakness
in
his
eye
which
affect
them
in
such
a
strangely
irregular
manner
on

occasion

<EOS>
Magloire
know
what
this
symptom
mean
,
and
would
have
become
confused
if
he
have
not

a
police
agent

<EOS>
as
it
be
,
he
quietly
back
a
step
or
two
from
the

and
hold
his
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
"
Friend
Magloire
,
"
say
Lomaque
,
wink
mildly
,
"
your
last
remark
look
to
me
like
a
question
in
disguise
.
<EOS>
I
put
question
constantly
to

;
I
never
answer
question
myself
.
<EOS>
You
want
to
know
,
citizen
,
what
our
superintendent
's
secret
motive
be
for
denounce
his

's
brother
?
<EOS>
suppose
you
try

It
will
be

<EOS>
"
I
find
nothing

<EOS>
but
I
shall
have
a
little
note
ready
for
you
immediately
.
<EOS>
sit
down
at
the
other
desk
,
friend
Magloire
;
I
be
very
fond
of
you
when
you
be
not
inquisitive
;
pray
sit
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
while
address
this
polite
invitation
to
the
agent
in
his
soft
voice
,
Lomaque
produce
his
pocketbook
,
and
draw
from
it
a
little
note
,
which
he
open
and
read
through
attentively
.
<EOS>
It
be
head
:
"
<EOS>
Private
Instructions
relative
to
Superintendent
Danville
,
"
and
proceed
thus
:
  
<EOS>
"
the
undersigned
can
confidently
assert
,
from
long
domestic
experience
in
Danville
's
household
that
his
motive
for
denounce
his
wife
's
brother
be
purely
a
personal
one
,
and
be
not
in
the
most
remote
degree
connect
with
politic
.
<EOS>
briefly
,
the
fact
be
these
:
Louis
Trudaine
,
from
the
first
,
oppose
his
sister
's
marriage
with
Danville
,
distrust
the
latter
's
temper
and
disposition
.
<EOS>
the
marriage
,
however
,
take
place
,
and
the
brother
resign
himself
to
await
result
 
take
the
precaution
of
live
in
the
same
neighborhood
as
his
sister
,
to
interpose
,
if
need
be
,
between
the
crime
which
the
husband
may
commit
and
the
suffering
which
the
wife
may
endure
.
<EOS>
the
result
soon
exceed
his
bad
anticipation
,
and
call
for
the
interposition
for
which
he
have
prepare
himself
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
of
inflexible
firmness
,
patience
,
and
integrity
,
and
he
make
the
protection
and
consolation
of
his
sister
the
business
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
give
his
brother
-
in
-
law
no
pretext
for
openly
quarrel
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
neither
to
be
deceive
,
irritated
,
nor
tired
out
,
and
he
be
Danville
's
superior
every
way
 
in
conduct
,
temper
,
and
capacity
.
<EOS>
under
these
circumstance
,
it
be
unnecessary
to
say
that
his
brother
-
in
-
law
's
enmity
toward
him
be
of
the
most
implacable
kind
,
and
equally
unnecessary
to
hint
at
the
perfectly
plain
motive
of
the
denunciation
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
to
the
suspicious
circumstance
affect
not
Trudaine
only
,
but
his
sister
as
well
,
the
undersigned
regret
his
inability
,
thus
far
,
to
offer
either
explanation
or
suggestion

<EOS>
at
this
preliminary
stage
,
the
affair
seem
involve
in
impenetrable
mystery

<EOS>
Lomaque
read
these
line
through

down
to

it
when
a

irritably

man
in
travel
costume
,
cover
with
dust
,
enter
,
quietly
whisper
a
word
or
two
in
his
ear
,
and
then
go
out

<EOS>
Lomaque
start
at
the
whisper
,
and
,
open
his
note
again
,
hastily
write
under
his
signature
:

can
hardly

riddle
this

<EOS>
He
take
a
turn
or
two
in
silence
 
then
stop
at
the
open
window
,
look
out
on
what
little
glimpse
the
street
afford
him
of
the
sunset

now

officially

to

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
He
return
to
the

and
sit
down
to
his
paper
,
with
the
dogged
air
of
a
man
determine
to
drive
away
vex

by
dint
of
sheer
hard
work

<EOS>
for
more
than
an
hour
he
labor
on
resolutely
,
munch
a
bit
of
dry
bread
from
time
to
time

<EOS>
then
he
pause
a
little
,
and
begin
to
think
again
.
<EOS>
gradually
the
summer
twilight
fade
,

the

grow
dark

<EOS>
"
perhaps
we
shall
tide
over

say
Lomaque

ring
his
handbell
for
light

<EOS>
They
be
bring
in
,

ominously
return

small

packet

more
like

<EOS>
Lomaque
open

eagerly

neatly

sign
with
Robespierre

on
second

I

back
in
time
to

that
it
may
not
be
all
the
well

He
be
unprepared

<EOS>
watch
him
closely
when
it
take
place
,
and
report
privately
to
me

I
be
afraid

I
abhor

He
stop
and
wipe
his
forehead
 
then
unlock
his
desk

a
bottle
of
brandy

pour
himself
out

sip

slowly

wonder

"
after

it

<EOS>
Consoling
himself
as
he
best
could
with
this
reflection
,
Chief
Police
Agent
Lomaque
blow
out
the
candle
,
and
quit
the
room

.
  
<EOS>
ignorant
of
the
change
in
her
husband

plan
,
which
be
to
bring
him
back
to
Paris
a
day
before
the
time

be
fix
for
his

,
Sister
Rose
have
leave
her
solitary
home
to
spend
the
evening
with
her
brother

They
have
sit
talk
together
long
after
sunset
,
and
have
let
the
darkness
steal
on
them
insensibly
,
as
people
will
who
be
only
occupy
with
quiet
,
familiar
conversation
.
<EOS>
thus
it
happen
,
by
a
curious
coincidence
,
that
just
as
Lomaque
be
blow
out
his
candle
at
the
office
<EOS>
Rose
be
light
the
reading

lamp
at
her
brother
's
lodging

<EOS>
five
year
of
disappointment
and
sorrow
have
sadly
change
her
to
outward
view
.
<EOS>
Her
face
look
thin
and
long
;
the
once
delicate
red
and
white
of
her
complexion
be
go
;
her
figure
have
waste
under
the
influence
of
some
weakness
,
which
have
already
make
her
stoop
a
little
when
she
walk
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
have
lose
its
maiden
shyness
,
only
to
become
unnaturally
quiet
and
subdued
.
<EOS>
of
all
the
charm
which
have
so
fatally
,
yet
so
innocently
,
allure
her
heartless
husband
,
but
one
remain
 
the
win
gentleness
of
her
voice
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
touch
now
and
then
with
a
note
of
sadness
,
but
the
soft
attraction
of
its
even
,
natural
tone
still
remain
.
<EOS>
in
the
marring
of
all
other
harmony
,
this
one
harmony
have
be
preserve
unchanged
.
<EOS>
Her
brother
,
though
his
face
be
careworn
,
and
his
manner
sad
than
of
old
,
look
less
altered
from
his
former
self
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
most
fragile
material

soon
show
the
flaw

and

perilous
undertaking

anxiously

light
the

They

the

beyond
it

there

the
deadly
silence
of
Terror

,
for

have
hang
over
Paris

<EOS>
It
be

a
little
strangely
at
night

for
suspicion

and
be
denounce
by
him

in

the

go
to
his
section

<EOS>
You
forget
that
servant
and
master
be
equal
now

<EOS>
I
be
not
suppose
to
keep
a
servant
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
citizen
live
with
me
who
lay
me
under
domestic
obligation
,
for
which
I
make
a
pecuniary
acknowledgment
.
<EOS>
no

no

if

we
have
get
to
another
unpleasant

already

You
will
find
a
little
book
on

Corneille

even
in

do

<EOS>
Rose
remember
well

almost
as

in

<EOS>
She
shrink
at

the

notice
the
action

he
control
himself
,
and
,
take
her
hand
,
lead
her
in
silence
to
a
chair

<EOS>
"
I

those

affected

would
have
certainly
disbelieve
every
word

the
friendly
speech

grow
confused

<EOS>
It
be
easy
to
guard
himself
from

peril

the
hard
trial

just

up
wildly

of

half
-
suppressedly

at

<EOS>
no

vehement
whisper

many

other
,
follow
;
then
a
swaying
among
the
assembly
of
official
people
;
then
a
great
stillness
;
then
the
sudden
appearance
of
Danville
,
alone
,
at
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
the
look
of
him
,
as
he
turn
his
ghastly
face
toward
the
audience
,
silence
and
steady
them
in
an
instant
,
just
as
they
be
on
the
point
of
fall
into
fresh
confusion
.
<EOS>
every
one
stretch
forward
eagerly
to
hear
what
he
would
say
.
<EOS>
His
lip
move
;
but
the
few
word
that
fall
from
them
be
inaudible
,
except
to
the
person
who
happen
to
be
close
by
him

<EOS>
have
speak

he
leave
the

who
be

to
lead
him
toward
the
private
door
of
the
court
,
and
,
consequently
,
also
toward
the
prisoner

platform
.
<EOS>
He
stop
,
however
,
halfway
,
quickly
turn
his
face
from
the
prisoner
,
and
point
toward
the
public
door
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
hall
,
cause
himself
to
be
lead
out
into
the
air
by
that
direction

<EOS>
when
he
have
go
the
president
,
address
himself
partly
to
Trudaine
and
partly
to
the
audience
,
say
:
  
"
the
Citizen

He

retire

in

himself
to
me
to
come
back

a
new
light
on

suspicious
statement

until
the
return

the
accuse

to
suspend
any

acknowledgment

complicity

these
cry
rise
from
the
audience
the
moment
the
president
have
do
speak
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
direct
at
Trudaine
,
who
have
make
a
last
desperate
effort
to
persuade
his
sister
to
keep
silence
,
and
have
be
detect
in
the
attempt
by
the
spectator

the
woman
,
settle
themselves
comfortably
on

resume
their
work

"
Rose

the
court

to
hear
you

"
say
the
president
,
cross
his
leg
and
lean
back
luxuriously
in
his
large
armchair
.
  
<EOS>
amid
all
the
noise
and
confusion
of
the
last
few
minute
,
Rose
have
stand
ever
in
the
same
attitude
,
with
that
strangely
fix
expression
never
alter
on
her
face
but
once
.
<EOS>
when
her
husband
make
his
way
to
the
side
of
the
table
and
stand
there
prominently
alone
,
her
lip
tremble
a
little
,
and
a
faint
shade
of
color
pass
swiftly
over
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
even
that
slight
change
have
vanish
now
 
<EOS>
she
be
paler
,
stiller
,
more
widely
alter
from
her
former
self
than
ever
,
as
she
face
the
president
and
say
these
word
:
  
"
I
wish
to
follow
my
brother
's
example
and
make
my
confession
,
as
he
have
make
his
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
he
have
speak
for
me
;
but
he
be
too
generous
to
say
any
word
except
such
as
he
think
may
save
me
from
share
his
punishment
.
<EOS>
I
refuse
to
be
save
,
unless
he
be
save
with
me
.
<EOS>
where
he
go
when
he
leave
this
place
,
I
will
go
;
what
he
suffer
,
I
will
suffer
;
if
he
be
to
die
,
I
believe
God
will
grant
me
the
strength
to
die
resignedly
with
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
pause
for
a
moment
,
and
half
turn
toward
Trudaine
 
then
check
herself
instantly
and
go
on
:
"
<EOS>
this
be
what
I
now
wish
to
say
,
as
to
my
share
in
the
offense
charge
against
my
brother
.
<EOS>
some
time
ago
,
he
tell
me
one
day
that
he
have
see
my
husband
's
mother
in
Paris
,
disguise
as
a
poor
woman
;
that
he
have
speak
to
her
,
and
force
her
to
acknowledge
herself
.
<EOS>
up
to
this
time
we
have
all
feel
certain
that
she
have
leave
France
,
because
she
hold
old
-
fashioned
opinion
which
it
be
dangerous
for
people
to
hold
now
 
have
leave
France
before
we
come
to
Paris
.
<EOS>
She
tell
my
brother
that
she
have
indeed
go
(
with
an
old
,
try
servant
of
the
family
to
help
and
protect
her
)
as
far
as
Marseilles
;
and
that
,
find
unforeseen
difficulty
there
in
get
further
,
she
have
take
it
as
a
warning
from
Providence
not
to
desert
her
son
,
of
whom
she
be
very
passionately
fond
,
and
from
whom
she
have
be
most
unwilling
to
depart
.
<EOS>
instead
of
wait
in
exile
for
quieter
time
,
she
determine
to
go
and
hide
herself
in
Paris
,
know
her
son
be
go
there
too
.
<EOS>
She
assume
the
name
of
her
old
and
faithful
servant
,
who
decline
to
the
last
to
leave
her
unprotected
;
and
she
propose
to
live
in
the
strict
secrecy
and
retirement
,
watch
,
unknown
,
the
career
of
her
son
,
and
ready
at
a
moment
's
notice
to
disclose
herself
to
him
,
when
the
settlement
of
public
affair
may
reunite
her
safely
to
her
beloved
child
.
<EOS>
My
brother
think
this
plan
full
of
danger
,
both
for
herself
,
for
her
son
,
and
for
the
honest
old
man
who
be
risk
his
head
for
his
mistress
's
sake
.
<EOS>
I
think
so
too
;
and
in
an
evil
hour
I
say
to
Louis
:
"
Will
you
try
in
secret
to
get
my
husband
's
mother
away
,
and
see
that
her
faithful
servant
make
her
really
leave
France
this
time
?
<EOS>
"
I
wrongly
ask
my
brother
to
do
this
for
a
selfish
reason
of
my
own
 
a
reason
connect
with
my
married
life
,
which
have
not
be
a
happy
one
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
succeed
in
gain
my
husband
's
affection
,
and
be
not
treat
kindly
by
him
.
<EOS>
My
brother
 
who
have
always
love
me
far
more
dearly
,
I
be
afraid
,
than
I
have
ever
deserve
 
my
brother
increase
his
kindness
to
me
,
see
me
treat
unkindly
by
my
husband
.
<EOS>
this
make
ill
-
blood
between
them
.
<EOS>
My
thought
,
when
I
ask
my
brother
to
do
for
me
<EOS>
what
I
have
say
,
be
,
that
if
we
two
in
secret
save
my
husband
's
mother
,
without
danger
to
him
,
from
imperil
herself
and
her
son
,
we
should
,
when
the
time
come
for
speak
of
what
we
have
do
,
appear
to
my
husband
in
a
new
and
well
light
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
show
how
well
I
deserve
his
love
,
and
Louis
would
have
show
how
well
he
deserve
his
brother
-
in
-
law
's
gratitude
;
and
so
we
should
have
make
home
happy
at
last
,
and
all
three
have
live
together
affectionately
.
<EOS>
this
be
my
thought
;
and
when
I
tell
it
to
my
brother
,
and
ask
him
if
there
would
be
much
risk
,
out
of
his
kindness
and
indulgence
toward
me
,
he
say
"
no
.
<EOS>
"
He
have
so
use
me
to
accept
sacrifice
for
my
happiness
that
I
let
him
endanger
himself
to
help
me
in
my
little
household
plan
.
<EOS>
I
repent
this
bitterly
now
;
I
ask
his
pardon
with
my
whole
heart
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
acquit
,
I
will
try
to
show
myself
worthy
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
find
guilty
,
I
,
too
,
will
go
to
the
scaffold
,
and
die
with
my
brother
,
who
risk
his
life
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
cease
as
quietly
as
she
have
begin
,
and
turn
once
more
to
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
as
she
look
away
from
the
court
and
look
at
him
,
a
few
tear
come
into
her
eye
,
and
something
of
the
old
softness
of
form
and
gentleness
of
expression
seem
to
return
to
her
face
.
<EOS>
He
let
her
take
his
hand
,
but
he
seem
purposely
to
avoid
meet
the
anxious
gaze
she
fix
on
him
.
<EOS>
His
head
sink
on
his
breast
;
he
draw
his
breath
heavily
,
his
countenance
darken
and
grow
distort
,
as
if
he
be
suffer
some
sharp
pang
of
physical
pain
.
<EOS>
He
bend
down
a
little
,
and
,
lean
his
elbow
on
the
rail
before
him
,
cover
his
face
with
his
hand
;
and
so
quell
the
rise
agony
,
so
force
back
the
scald
tear
to
his
heart
.
<EOS>
the
audience
have
hear
Rose
in
silence
,
and
they
preserve
the
same
tranquillity
when
she
have
do
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
rare
tribute
to
a
prisoner
from
the
people
of
the
Reign
of
Terror
.
  
<EOS>
the
president
look
round
at
his
colleague
,
and
shake
his
head
suspiciously
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
statement
of
the
female
prisoner
's
complicate
the
matter
very
seriously
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
be
there
anybody
in
court
,
"
he
add
,
look
at
the
person
behind
his
chair
,
"
who
know
where
the
mother
of
Superintendent
Danville
and
the
servant
be
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lomaque
come
forward
at
the
appeal
,
and
place
himself
by
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
citizen
agent
!
<EOS>
"
continue
the
president
,
look
hard
at
him
,
"
be
you
overcome
by
the
heat
,
too
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
fit
seem
to
take
him
,
citizen
president
,
when
the
female
prisoner
have
make
an
end
of
her
statement
,
"
exclaim
Magloire
,
press
forward
officiously
.
  
<EOS>
Lomaque
give
his
subordinate
a
look
which
send
the
man
back
directly
to
the
shelter
of
the
official
group
;
then
say
,
in
low
tone
than
be
customary
with
him
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
receive
information
relative
to
the
mother
of
Superintendent
Danville
and
the
servant
,
and
be
ready
to
answer
any
question
that
may
be
put
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
they
now
?
"
ask
the
president
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
and
the
servant
be
know
to
have
cross
the
frontier
,
and
be
suppose
to
be
on
their
way
to
Cologne
.
<EOS>
but
,
since
they
have
enter
Germany
,
their
whereabout
be
necessarily
a
matter
of
uncertainty
to
the
republican
authority
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
have
you
any
information
relative
to
the
conduct
of
the
old
servant
while
he
be
in
Paris
?
"
  
"
I
have
information
enough
to
prove
that
he
be
not
an
object
for
political
suspicion
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
have
be
simply
animate
by
servile
zeal
for
the
woman
's
interest
;
to
have
perform
for
her
all
the
menial
office
of
a
servant
in
private
;
and
to
have
mislead
the
neighbor
by
affect
equality
with
her
in
public
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
any
reason
to
believe
that
Superintendent
Danville
be
privy
to
his
mother
's
first
attempt
at
escape
from
France
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
infer
it
from
what
the
female
prisoner
have
say
,
and
for
other
reason
which
it
would
be
irregular
to
detail
before
the
tribunal
.
<EOS>
the
proof
can
no
doubt
be
obtain
if
I
be
allow
time
to
communicate
with
the
authority
at
Lyons
and
Marseilles
.

I
tell
you
plainly

at

there
be
a

the

will
be
call

It

It
be

business
to
make

<EOS>
the
duplicate
will
be
compare
with

with

too

either
by

drinker

I

with
such
wine

if
 
after
the
reading

the
marking
of

I
can

in
the
present
confusion
of
prisoner

prisoner
pour
out
every

you
will
have
the

Lomaque
look
toward

door

lower
his

to
a
fainter
whisper
before

continue

I
have
only
put
off
the
date
of
your
death
and
your
sister

,

have
lay
my

neck
under
the
axe

those

be
all
I
can
do

"
  
<EOS>
He
pause
,
and
Trudaine
again
endeavor
to
speak
such
word
as
may
show
that
he
be
not
unworthy
of
the
deadly
risk
which
Lomaque
be
prepared
to
encounter
.
<EOS>
but
once
more
the
chief
agent
peremptorily
and
irritably
interpose
:
  
"
I
tell
you
,
for
the
third
time
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
will
listen
to
no
expression
of
gratitude
from
you
till
I
know
when
I
deserve
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
I
recollect
your
father
's
timely
kindness
to
me
 
true
that
I
have
not
forget
what
pass
,
five
year
since
at
your
house
by
the
river
-
side
.
<EOS>
I
remember
everything
,
down
to
what
you
would
consider
the
veri
trifle
 
that
cup
of
coffee
,
for
instance
,
which
your
sister
keep
hot
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
then
that
you
would
think
better
of
me
some
day
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
you
do
now
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
all
.
<EOS>
You
want
to
glorify
me
to
my
face
for
risk
my
life
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
hear
you
,
because
my
risk
be
of
the
paltry
kind
.
<EOS>
I
be
weary
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
look
back
to
it
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
I
be
too
old
to
look
forward
to
what
be
leave
of
it
with
hope
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
that
night
at
your
house
before
the
wedding
 
something
in
what
you
say
,
in
what
your
sister
do
 
which
alter
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
my
day
of
gloom
and
self
-
reproach
,
from
time
to
time
,
since
then
.
<EOS>
I
have
sicken
at
my
slavery
,
and
subjection
,
and
duplicity
,
and
cringing
,
first
under
one
master
then
under
another
.
<EOS>
I
have
long
to
look
back
at
my
life
,
and
comfort
myself
with
the
sight
of
some
good
action
,
just
as
a
frugal
man
comfort
himself
with
the
sight
of
his
little
saving
lay
by
in
an
old
drawer
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
do
this
,
and
I
want
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
the
want
take
me
like
a
fit
,
at
uncertain
interval
 
suddenly
,
under
the
most
incomprehensible
influence
.
<EOS>
a
glance
up
at
the
blue
sky
 
starlight
over
the
house
of
this
great
city
,
when
I
look
out
at
the
night
from
my
garret
window
 
a
child
's
voice
come
suddenly
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
know
where
from
 
the
piping
of
my
neighbor
's
linnet
in
his
little
cage
 
now
one
trifling
thing
,
now
another
 
wake
up
that
want
in
me
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
rascal
as
I
be
,
those
few
simple
word
your
sister
speak
to
the
judge
go
through
and
through
me
like
a
knife
.
<EOS>
strange
,
in
a
man
like
me
,
be
not
it
?
<EOS>
I
be
amazed
at
it
myself
.
<EOS>
My
life
?
<EOS>
bah
!
<EOS>
I
have
let
it
out
for
hire
to
be
kick
about
by
rascal
from
one
dirty
place
to
another
,
like
a
football
!
<EOS>
It
be
my
whim
to
give
it
a
last
kick
myself
,
and
throw
it
away
decently
before
it
lodge
on
the
dunghill
forever
.
<EOS>
Your
sister
keep
a
good
cup
of
coffee
hot
for
me
,
and
I
give
her
a
bad
life
in
return
for
the
compliment
.
<EOS>
You
want
to
thank
me
for
it
?
<EOS>
what
folly
!
<EOS>
thank
me
when
I
have
do
something
useful
.
<EOS>
do
not
thank
me
for
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
snap
his
finger
contemptuously
as
he
speak
,
and
walk
away
to
the
outer
door
to
receive
the
jailer
,
who
return
at
that
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,

inquire
the
hunchback
,
"
have
anybody
ask
for
me
?

"
no

answer
Lomaque
;
"
not

the
room

sort
of
wine
do
you
get
?

so
-
so

good
at

good
at

"
ah
!

you
should
go
to
my
shop
and
try
a
certain
cask
,
fill
with
a
particular
vintage

<EOS>
"
what
shop
?
<EOS>
which
vintage
?

"
  
<EOS>

I
can
not
stop
to
tell
you
now
;
but
we
shall
most
likely
meet
again
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
expect
to
be
at
the
prison
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
ask
for
you
?
<EOS>
good
!

I
will
not
forget
!
"
<EOS>
with
those
farewell
word
he
go
out
,
and
never
so
much
as
look
back
at
the
prisoner
before
he
close
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
Trudaine
return
to
his
sister
,
fearful
lest
his
face
should
betray
what
have
pass
during
the
extraordinary
interview
between
Lomaque
and
himself
.
<EOS>
but
,
whatever
change
there
may
be
in
his
expression
,
Rose
do
not
seem
to
notice
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
still
strangely
inattentive
to
all
outward
thing
.
<EOS>
that
spirit
of
resignation
,
which
be
the
courage
of
woman
in
all
great
emergency
,
seem
now
to
be
the
one
animate
spirit
that
feed
the
flame
of
life
within
her
.
  
<EOS>
when
her
brother
sit
down
by
her
,
she
only
take
his
hand
gently
and
say
:
"
let
us
stop
together
like
this
,
Louis
,
till
the
time
come

I
be
not
afraid

it

I

you

make
me
love
life

you

you
remember
the
time

I
use
to
grieve
that
I
have
never
have
a
child
to
be
some
comfort
to
me

I
be
think
,
a
moment
ago
,
how
terrible
it
would
have
be
now

if
my
wish
have
be
grant
.

It
be
a
blessing
for
me
,
in
this
great
misery

that
I
be
childless

let
us
talk
of
old
day

Louis

as
long
as

You

It

indeed
a
pleasure
to

at
that
face

after
Lomaque

last
experience

<EOS>
three
year
of
repose

when

there

look
earnestly

eagerly

"
the
price

not

"

<EOS>
He
nod
,
and
fold
up
the
letter
mechanically
in
the
old
official
form
,
make
a
note
on
it
in
the
old
official
manner
.
<EOS>
Trudaine
observe
the
action
,
and
feel
its
association
with
past
time
of
trouble
and
terror
.
<EOS>
His
face
grow
grave
again
as
he
say
to
Lomaque
,
"
and
be
this
good
news
really
all
the
news
of
importance
you
have
to
tell
us

<EOS>
Lomaque
hesitate
,
and
fidget
in
his
chair
.
<EOS>
"
what
other
news
I
have
will
bear
keep

"
he
reply
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
many
question
I
should
like
to
ask
first
,
about
your
sister

yourself

<EOS>
do
you
mind
allow
me
to
refer
for
a
moment
to
the
time
when
we
last
meet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
address
this
inquiry
to
Rose
,
who
answer
in
the
negative
;
but
her
voice
seem
to
falter
,
even
in
say
the
one
word
"
no
.
"
<EOS>
She
turn
her
head
away
when
she
speak
;
and
Lomaque
notice
that
her
hand
tremble
as
she
take
up
some
work
lie
on
a
table
near
,
and
hurriedly
occupy
herself
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
speak
as
little
about
that
time
as
possible
,
"
say
Trudaine
,
look
significantly
toward
his
sister
;
"
but
we
have
some
question
to
ask
you
in
our
turn

so
the
allusion

for
this
once

inevitable

<EOS>
Your
sudden
disappearance
at
the
very
crisis
of
that
time
of
danger
have
not
yet
be
fully
explain
to
us

<EOS>
the
one
short
note
which
you
leave
behind
<EOS>
you
help
us
to
guess
at
what
have
happen
rather
than
to
understand
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
easily
explain
it
now
,
"
answer
Lomaque
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
sudden
overthrow
of
the
Reign
of
Terror
,
which
be
salvation
to
you
,
be
destruction
to
me

<EOS>
the
new
republican
reign
be
a
reign
of
mercy

except
for
the
tail
of
Robespierre

as
the
phrase
run
then

wicked

unfortunate

and
justly
,
with
the
fate
of
Robespierre

<EOS>
I
,
among
other
,
fall
under
this
menace
of
death
.
<EOS>
I
deserve
to
die
,

should
have
resign
myself
to
the
guillotine

for
you

<EOS>
from
the
course
take
by
public
event

I
know
you
would
be
save
;
and
although
your
safety
be
the
work
of
circumstance
,
still
I
have
a
hand
in
render
it
possible
at
the
outset
;
and
a
yearning
come
over
me
to
behold
you
both
free
again
with
my
own
eye
 
a
selfish
yearning
to
see
in
you
a
living
,
breathing
,
real
result
of
the
one
good
impulse
of
my
heart
,
which
I
could
look
back
on
with
satisfaction

<EOS>
this
desire
give
me
a
new
interest
in
life

<EOS>
I
resolve
to
escape
death
if
it
be
possible

<EOS>
for
ten
day
I
lay
hidden
in
Paris

<EOS>
after
that
 
thank
to
certain
scrap

useful
knowledge

my
experience
in

secret
police

give

I
succeed
in
get
clear
of
Paris

in
make
my
way
safely
to
Switzerland

<EOS>
the
rest
of
my
story
be
so
short
and
so
soon
tell
that
I
may
as
well
get
it
over
at
once
.
<EOS>
the
only
relation
I
know
of
in
the
world
to
apply
to
be
a
cousin
of
mine
(
whom
I
have
never

I
throw
myself
on

He
discover
that
I
be
likely

with

to
be
of
some
use

take
me
into

give

about
for

till
within

in

It

in

I

happy

little
hard
on
an
old
man
to
be
always
ask
question
of
him
,
and
never
answer
one
of
his
inquiry
in
return
?
"
<EOS>
he
say
to
Rose
,
very
gayly
as
to
manner
,
but
rather
uneasily
as
to
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
not
speak
out
till
we
two
be
alone
,
"
think
Trudaine
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
good
to
risk
nothing
,
and
to
humor
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
come
,
"
he
say
aloud
;
"
no
grumbling
.
<EOS>
I
admit
that
it
be
your
turn
to
hear
our
story
now
;
and
I
will
do
my
good
to
gratify
you
.
<EOS>
but
before
I
begin
,
"
he
add
,
turn
to
his
sister
,
"
let
me
suggest
,
Rose
,
that
if
you
have
any
household
matter
to
settle
upstairs
"
  
"
I
know
what
you
mean
,
"
she
interrupt
,
hurriedly
,
take
up
the
work
which
,
during
the
last
few
minute
,
she
have
allow
to
drop
into
her
lap
;
"
but
I
be
strong
than
you
think
;
I
can
face
the
bad
of
our
recollection
composedly
.
<EOS>
go
on
,
Louis
;
pray
go
on
 
<EOS>
I
be
quite
fit
to
stop
and
hear
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
we
suffer
in
the
first
day
of
our
suspense
,
after
the
success
of
your
stratagem
,
"
say
Trudaine
,
turn
to
Lomaque
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
on
the
evening
after
we
have
see
you
for
the
last
time
at
St.
Lazare
that
strange
,
confused
rumor
of
an
impending
convulsion
in
Paris
first
penetrate
within
our
prison
wall
.
<EOS>
during
the
next
few
day
the
face
of
our
jailer
be
enough
to
show
us
that
those
rumor
be
true
,
and
that
the
Reign
of
Terror
be
actually
threaten
with
overthrow
at
the
hand
of
the
Moderate
Party
.
<EOS>
We
have
hardly
time
to
hope
everything
from
this
bless
change
before
the
tremendous
news
of
Robespierre
's
attempt
suicide
,
then
of
his
condemnation
and
execution
,
reach
us
.
<EOS>
the
confusion
produce
in
the
prison
be
beyond
all
description
.
<EOS>
the
accuse
who
have
be
try
and
the
accuse
who
have
not
be
try
get
mingle
together
.
<EOS>
from
the
day
of
Robespierre
's
arrest
,
no
order
come
to
the
authority
,
no
death
-
list
reach
the
prison
.
<EOS>
the
jailer
,
terrify
by
rumor
that
the
low
accomplice
of
the
tyrant
would
be
hold
responsible
,
and
be
condemn
with
him
,
make
no
attempt
to
maintain
order
.
<EOS>
some
of
them
 
that
hunchback
man
among
the
rest
 
desert
their
duty
altogether
.
<EOS>
the
disorganization
be
so
complete
,
that
when
the
commissioner
from
the
new
Government
come
to
St.
Lazare
,
some
of
us
be
actually
half
starve
from
want
of
the
bare
necessity
of
life
.
<EOS>
to
inquire
separately
into
our
case
be
find
to
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
sometimes
the
necessary
paper
be
lose
;
sometimes
what
document
remain
be
incomprehensible
to
the
new
commissioner
.
<EOS>
They
be
oblige
,
at
last
,
to
make
short
work
of
it
by
call
us
up
before
them
in
dozen
.
<EOS>
try
or
not
try
,
we
have
all
be
arrest
by
the
tyrant
,
have
all
be
accuse
of
conspiracy
against
him
,
and
be
all
ready
to
hail
the
new
Government
as
the
salvation
of
France
.
<EOS>
in
nine
case
out
of
ten
,
our
good
claim
to
be
discharge
be
derive
from
these
circumstance
.
<EOS>
We
be
trust
by
Tallien
and
the
man
of
the
Ninth
Thermidor
,
because
we
have
be
suspect
by
Robespierre
,
Couthon
,
and
St.
just
.
<EOS>
arrest
informally
,
we
be
now
liberate
informally
.
<EOS>
when
it
come
to
my
sister
's
turn
and
mine
,
we
be
not
under
examination
five
minute
.
<EOS>
no
such
thing
as
a
search
question
be
ask
of
us
;
I
believe
we
may
even
have
give
our
own
name
with
perfect
impunity
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
previously
instruct
Rose
that
we
be
to
assume
our
mother
's
maiden
name
 
Maurice
.
<EOS>
as
the
citizen
and
citoyenne
Maurice
,
accordingly
,
we
pass
out
of
prison
 
under
the
same
name
we
have
live
ever
since
in
hide
here
.
<EOS>
Our
past
repose
have
depend
,
our
future
happiness
will
depend
,
on
our
escape
from
death
be
keep
the
profound
secret
among
us
three
.
<EOS>
for
one
all
sufficient
reason
,
which
you
can
easily
guess
at
,
the
brother
and
sister
Maurice
must
still
know
nothing
of
Louis
Trudaine
and
Rose
Danville
,
except
that
they
be
two
among
the
hundred
of
victim
guillotine
during
the
Reign
of
Terror
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
speak
the
last
sentence
with
a
faint
smile
,
and
with
the
air
of
a
man
try
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
to
treat
a
grave
subject
lightly
.
<EOS>
His
face
cloud
again
,
however
,
in
a
moment
,
when
he
look
toward
his
sister
,
as
he
cease
.
<EOS>
Her
work
have
once
more
drop
on
her
lap
,
her
face
be
turn
away
so
that
he
could
not
see
it
;
but
he
know
by
the
trembling
of
her
clasped
hand
,
as
they
rest
on
her
knee
,
and
by
the
slight
swelling
of
the
vein
on
her
neck
which
she
could
not
hide
from
him
,
that
her
boasted
strength
of
nerve
have
desert
her
.
<EOS>
three
year
of
repose
have
not
yet
enable
her
to
hear
her
marriage
name
utter
,
or
to
be
present
when
past
time
of
deathly
suffering
and
terror
be
refer
to
,
without
betray
the
shock
in
her
face
and
manner
.
<EOS>
Trudaine
look
sadden
,
but
in
no
way
surprise
by
what
he
see
.
<EOS>
make
a
sign
to
Lomaque
to
say
nothing
,
he
rise
and
take
up
his
sister
's
hood
,
which
lie
on
a
window
-
seat
near
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
Rose
,
"
he
say
,
"
the
sun
be
shine
,
the
sweet
spring
air
be
invite
us
out
.
<EOS>
let
us
have
a
quiet
stroll
along
the
bank
of
the
stream
.
<EOS>
why
should
we
keep
our
good
friend
here
coope
up
in
this
narrow
little
room
,
when
we
have
mile
and
mile
of
beautiful
landscape
to
show
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
threshold
?
<EOS>
come
,
it
be
high
treason
to
Queen
Nature
to
remain
indoor
on
such
a
morning
as
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
without
wait
for
her
to
reply
,
he
put
on
her
hood
,
draw
her
arm
through
his
,
and
lead
the
way
out
.
<EOS>
Lomaque
's
face
grow
grave
as
he
follow
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
I
only
show
the
bright
side
of
my
budget
of
news
in
her
presence
,

think
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
be
not
well
at
heart
yet
.
<EOS>
I
may
have
hurt
her
,
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
I
may
have
hurt
her
again
sadly
,
if
I
have
not
hold
my
tongue
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
walk
for
a
little
while
down
the
bank
of
the
stream
,
talk
of
indifferent
matter
;
then
return
to
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
by
that
time
Rose
have
recover
her
spirit
,
and
could
listen
with
interest
and
amusement
to
Lomaque
's
dryly
-
humorous
description
of
his
life
as
a
clerk
at
chalon
-
sur
-
Marne
.
<EOS>
They
part
for
a
little
while
at
the
cottage
door
.
<EOS>
Rose
retire
to
the
upstairs
room
from
which
she
have
be
summon
by
her
brother
.
<EOS>
Trudaine
and
Lomaque
return
to
wander
again
along
the
bank
of
the
stream
.
  
<EOS>
with
one
accord
,
and
without
a
word
pass
between
them
,
they
leave
the
neighborhood
of
the
cottage
hurriedly
;
then
stop
on
a
sudden
,
and
attentively
look
each
other
in
the
face
 
look
in
silence
for
an
instant
.
<EOS>
Trudaine
speak
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
for
have
spare
her
,
"
he
begin
,
abruptly
.
"
<EOS>
She
be
not
strong
enough
yet
to
bear
hearing
of
a
new
misfortune
,
unless
I
break
the
tiding
to
her
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
suspect
me
,
then
,
of
bring
bad
news
?
"
say
Lomaque
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
do
.
<EOS>
when
I
see
your
first
look
at
her
,
after
we
be
all
seat
in
the
cottage
parlor
,
I
know
it
.
<EOS>
speak
without
fear
,
without
caution
,
without
one
useless
word
of
preface
.
<EOS>
after
three
year
of
repose
,
if
it
please
God
to
afflict
us
again
,
I
can
bear
the
trial
calmly
;
and
,
if
need
be
,
can
strengthen
her
to
bear
it
calmly
,
too
.
<EOS>
I
say
again
,
Lomaque
,
speak
at
once
,
and
speak
out
!
<EOS>
I
know
your
news
be
bad
,
for
I
know
beforehand
that
it
be
news
of
Danville
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
right
;
my
bad
news
be
news
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
discover
the
secret
of
our
escape
from
the
guillotine
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
 
he
have
not
a
suspicion
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
believe
 
as
his
mother
,
as
every
one
do
 
that
you
be
both
execute
the
day
after
the
Revolutionary
Tribunal
sentence
you
to
death

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lomaque
,
you
speak
positively
of
that
belief
of
his
 
<EOS>
but
you
can
not
be
certain
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
,
on
the
most
indisputable
,
the
most
startling
evidence
 
on
the
authority
of
Danville
's
own
act
.
<EOS>
You
have
ask
me
to
speak
out

<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
again
 
I
insist
on
it
!
<EOS>
Your
news

Lomaque
 
your
news

<EOS>

You
shall
have
it
without
another
word
of
preface

<EOS>
Danville
be
on
the
point
of
be
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
the
answer
be
give
they
both
stop
by
the
bank
of
the
stream
,
and
again
look
each
other
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
minute
of
dead
silence
between
them
.
<EOS>
during
that
minute
,
the
water
bubble
by
happily
over
its
bed
of
pebble
seem
strangely
loud
,
the
singing
of
bird
in
a
little
wood
by
the
stream
-
side
strangely
near
and
shrill
,
in
both
their
ear
.
<EOS>
the
light
breeze
,
for
all
its
midday
warmth
,
touch
their
cheek
coldly
;
and
the
spring
sunlight
pour
on
their
face
feel
as
if
it
be
glimmer
on
them
through
winter
cloud
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
us
walk
on
,
"
say
Trudaine
,
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
prepare
for
bad
news
,
yet
not
for
that
.
<EOS>
be
you
certain
of
what
you
have
just
tell
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
certain
as
that
the
stream
here
be
flow
by
our
side
.
<EOS>
hear
how
I
make
the
discovery
,
and
you
will
doubt
no
longer
.
<EOS>
before
last
week
I
know
nothing
of
Danville
,
except
that
his
arrest
on
suspicion
by
Robespierre
's
order
be
,
as
event
turn
out
,
the
saving
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
be
imprison
,
as
I
tell
you
,
on
the
evening
after
he
have
hear
your
name
read
from
the
death
-
list
at
the
prison
grate
.
<EOS>
He
remain
in
confinement
at
the
Temple
,
unnoticed
in
the
political
confusion
out
-
of
-
door
,
just
as
you
remain
unnoticed
at
St.
Lazare
,
and
he
profit
precisely
in
the
same
manner
that
you
profit
by
the
timely
insurrection
which
overthrow
the
Reign
of
Terror
.
<EOS>
I
know
this
,
and
I
know
that
he
walk
out
of
prison
in
the
character
of
a
persecute
victim
of
Robespierre
's
 
and
,
for
well
than
three
year
past
,
I
know
no
more
.
<EOS>
now
listen
.
<EOS>
last
week
I
happen
to
be
wait
in
the
shop
of
my
employer
,
Citizen
Clairfait
,
for
some
paper
to
take
into
the
counting

house
,
when
an
old
man
enter
with
a
seal
parcel
,
which
he
hand
to
one
of
the
shopman
,
say
:

<EOS>
"
"
the

answer
the
old
man
;
"
but
if
you
please
,
you
can
give
mine

<EOS>
say
the
parcel
come
from
Citizen
Dubois
;
"
and
then
he
go
out
.
<EOS>
His
name
,
in
connection
with
his
elderly
look
,
strike
me
directly
.
  
<EOS>

"
do
that
old
fellow
live
at
Chalons
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask

<EOS>
"
"
no

the
shopman
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
He
be
here
in
attendance
on
a
customer
of
our
 
an
old
ex

aristocrat
name
Danville
.
<EOS>
She
be
on
a
visit
in
our
town
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
leave
you
to
imagine
how
that
reply
startle
and
amaze
me
.
<EOS>
the
shopman
can
answer
none
of
the
other
question
I
put
to
him
;
but
the
next
day
I
be
ask
to
dinner
by
my
employer
(
who
,
for
his
brother
's
sake
,
show
me
the
utmost
civility
)
.
<EOS>
on
enter
the
room
,
I
find
his
daughter
just
put
away
a
lavender
-
color
silk
scarf
,
on
which
she
have
be
embroider
in
silver
<EOS>
what
look
to
me
very
like
a
crest
and
coat
-
of
-
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
do
not
mind
your
see
what
I
be
about
,
Citizen
Lomaque
,
"
say
she
;
"
for
I
know
my
father
can
trust
you
.
<EOS>
that
scarf
be
send
back
to
us
by
the
purchaser
,
an
ex
-
emigrant
lady
of
the
old
aristocratic
school
,
to
have
her
family
coat
-
of
-
arm
embroider
on
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
rather
a
dangerous
commission
even
in
these
mercifully
democratic
time
,
be
it
not
?
"
say
I.
  
"
"
<EOS>
the
old
lady
<EOS>
,
you
must
know
,
"
say
she
,
"
be
as
proud
as
Lucifer
;
and
have
get
back
safely
to
France
in
these
day
of
moderate
republicanism

think
she
may
now
indulge
with
impunity
in
all
her
old
-
fashioned
notion
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
an
excellent
customer
of
ours
,
so
my
father
think
it
best
to
humor
her
,
without
,
however
,
trust
her
commission
to
any
of
the
workroom
woman
to
execute
.
<EOS>
We
be
not
live
under
the
Reign
of
Terror
now

on

but
say
nothing
more
of
any
importance
.
<EOS>
I
,
with
my
old
police
-
office
habit
,
set
to
the
next
day
,
and
try
to
make
some
discovery
for
myself
.
<EOS>
the
sum
of
what
I
find
out
be
this
:
Danville
's
mother
be
stay
with
General
Berthelin
's
sister
and
daughter
at
chalon
,
and
Danville
himself
be
expect
to
arrive
every
day
to
escort
them
all
three
to
Paris
,
where
the
marriage
-
contract
be
to
be
sign
at
the
general
's
house
.
<EOS>
discover
this
,
and
see
that
prompt
action
be
now
of
the
most
vital
importance
,
I
undertake
,
as
I
tell
you
,
my
employer
's
commission
for
Paris
,
depart
with
all
speed
,
and
stop
here
on
my
way
.
<EOS>
wait
!
<EOS>
I
have
not
do
yet
.
<EOS>
all
the
haste
I
can
make
be
not
haste
enough
to
give
me
a
good
start
of
the
wedding
party
.
<EOS>
on
my
road
here
,
the
diligence
by
which
I
travel
be
pass
by
a
carriage
,
post
along
at
full
speed
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
see
inside
that
carriage
;
but
I
look
at
the
box
-
seat
,
and
recognize
on
it
the
old
man
Dubois
.
<EOS>
He
whirl
by
in
a
cloud
of
dust
,
but
I
be
certain
of
him
;
and
I
say
to
myself
what
I
now
say
again
to
you
,
<EOS>
no
time
be
to
be
lose
!

<EOS>
"
no

Trudaine
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
three
year
have
pass
,
"
he
continue
,
in
a
low
voice
,
speak
to
himself
rather
than
to
Lomaque
;
"
three
year
since
the
day
when
I
lead
my
sister
out
of
the
gate
of
the
prison
 
three
year
since
I
say
in
my
heart
,
"
I
will
be
patient
,
and
will
not
seek
to
avenge
myself
.
<EOS>
Our
wrong
cry
from
earth
to
heaven
;
from
man
who
inflict
to
God
who
redress

<EOS>
when
the
day
of
reckoning
come
,
let
it
be
the
day
of
his
vengeance
,
not
of
mine

"
in
my
heart
I
say
those
word
 
I
have
be
true
to
them
 
<EOS>
I
have
wait
.
<EOS>
the
day
have
come
,
and
the
duty
it
demand
of
me
shall
be
fulfil

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
moment
's
silence
before
Lomaque
speak
again
.
"
<EOS>
Your
sister
?

he
begin
,
hesitatingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
there
only
that
my
purpose
falter

"
say
the
other
,
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
but
possible
to
spare
her
all
knowledge
of
this
last
trial
,
and
to
leave
the
accomplishment
of
the
terrible
task
to
me
alone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
possible
,
"
interpose
Lomaque
.
"
<EOS>
listen
to
what
I
advise
.
<EOS>
We
must
depart
for
Paris
by
the
diligence
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
we
must
take
your
sister
with
us
 
to
-
morrow
will
be
time
enough
;
people
do
not
sign
marriage
-
contract
on
the
evening
after
a
long
day
's
journey
.
<EOS>
We
must
go
then
,
and
we
must
take
your
sister
.
<EOS>
leave
the
care
of
her
in
Paris
,
and
the
responsibility
of
keep
her
in
ignorance
of
what
you
be
do
,
to
me
.
<EOS>
go
to
this
General
Berthelin
's
house
at
a
time
when
you
know
Danville
be
there
<EOS>
(
we
can
get
that
knowledge
through
the
servant
)
;
confront
him
without
a
moment
's
previous
warning
;
confront
him
as
a
man
rise
from
the
dead
;
confront
him
before
every
soul
in
the
room
though
the
room
should
be
full
of
people
 
and
leave
the
rest
to
the
self
-
betrayal
of
a
panic
-
stricken
man
.
<EOS>
say
but
three
word
,
and
your
duty
will
be
do
;
you
may
return
to
your
sister
,
and
may
depart
with
her
in
safety
to
your
old
retreat
at
Rouen
,
or
where
else
you
please
,
on
the
very
day
when
you
have
put
it
out
of
her
infamous
husband
's
power
to
add
another
to
the
list
of
his
crime
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
forget
the
suddenness
of
the
journey
to
Paris
,
"
say
Trudaine
.
<EOS>
"
how
be
we
to
account
for
it
without
the
risk
of
awaken
my
sister
's
suspicion
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
trust
that
to
me
,
"
answer
Lomaque
.
<EOS>
"
let
us
return
to
the
cottage
at
once
.
<EOS>
no
,
not
you
,
"
he
add
,
suddenly
,
as
they
turn
to
retrace
their
step
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
there
be
that
in
your
face
which
would
betray
us
.
<EOS>
leave
me
to
go
back
alone
 
<EOS>
I
will
say
that
you
have
go
to
give
some
order
at
the
inn
.
<EOS>
let
us
separate
immediately
.
<EOS>
You
will
recover
your
self
-
possession
 
you
will
get
to
look
yourself
again
sooner
 
if
you
be
leave
alone
.
<EOS>
I
know
enough
of
you
to
know
that
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
waste
another
minute
in
explanation
;
even
minute
be
precious
to
us
on
such
a
day
as
this
.
<EOS>
by
the
time
you
be
fit
to
meet
your
sister
again
,
I
shall
have
have
time
to
say
all
I
wish
to
her
,

shall
be
wait
at
the
cottage
to
tell
you
the
result
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
look
at
Trudaine
,
and
his
eye
seem
to
brighten
again
with
something
of
the
old
energy
and
sudden
decision
of
the
day
when
he
be
a
man
in
office
under
the
Reign
of
Terror
.
"
<EOS>
leave
it
to
me
,
"
he
say
;
and
,
wave
his
hand
,
turn
away
quickly
in
the
direction
of
the
cottage
.
  
<EOS>
nearly
an
hour
pass
before
Trudaine
venture
to
follow
him
.
<EOS>
when
he
at
length
enter
the
path
which
lead
to
the
garden
gate
,
he
see
his
sister
wait
at
the
cottage
door
.
<EOS>
Her
face
look
unusually
animated
;
and
she
run
forward
a
step
or
two
to
meet
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Louis
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
"
I
have
a
confession
to
make
,
and
I
must
beg
you
to
hear
it
patiently
to
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
know
that
our
good
Lomaque
,
though
he
come
in
tired
from
his
walk
,
occupy
himself
the
first
thing
,
at
my
request
,
in
write
the
letter
which
be
to
secure
to
us
our
dear
old
home
by
the
bank
of
the
Seine
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
do
,
he
look
at
me
,
and
say
,
"
I
should
like
to
be
present
at
your
happy
return
to
the
house
where
I
first
see
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
oh
,
come
,
come
with
us
!
"
<EOS>
I
say
directly
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
an
independent
man
,
"
he
answer
;
"
I
have
a
margin
of
time
allow
me
at
Paris
,
certainly
,
but
it
be
not
long
 
if
I
be
only
my
own
master
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
stop
.
<EOS>
Louis
,
I
remember
all
we
owe
to
him
;
I
remember
that
there
be
no
sacrifice
we
ought
not
to
be
too
glad
to
make
for
his
sake
;
I
feel
the
kindness
of
the
wish
he
have
express
;
and
perhaps
I
be
a
little
influence
by
my
own
impatience
to
see
once
more
my
flower
-
garden
and
the
room
where
we
use
to
be
so
happy
.
<EOS>
so
I
say
to
him
,
"
I
be
sure
Louis
will
agree
with
me
that
our
time
be
yours
,
and
that
we
shall
be
only
too
glad
to
advance
our
departure
so
as
to
make
travel
leisure
enough
for
you
to
come
with
us
to
Rouen
.
<EOS>
We
should
be
bad
than
ungrateful
<EOS>
"
He
stop
me
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
always
be
good
to
me
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
not
impose
on
your
kindness
now
.
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
you
have
formality
to
settle
before
you
can
leave
this
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
one
,
"
I
say
 
for
we
have
not
,
as
you
know
,
Louis
?
<EOS>
"
why
,
here
be
your
furniture
to
begin
with
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
a
few
chair
and
table
hire
from
the
inn
,
"
I
answer
;
"
we
have
only
to
give
the
landlady
our
key
,
to
leave
a
letter
for
the
owner
of
the
cottage
,
and
then
"
He
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
to
hear
you
talk
,
one
would
think
you
be
as
ready
to
travel
as
I
be
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
we
be
,
"
I
say
,
"
quite
as
ready
,
live
in
the
way
we
do
here
.
"
<EOS>
He
shake
his
head
;
but
you
will
not
shake
yours
,
Louis
,
I
be
sure
,
now
you
have
hear
all
my
long
story
?
<EOS>
You
can
not
blame
me
can
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
before
Trudaine
could
answer
,
Lomaque
look
out
of
the
cottage
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
be
tell
my
brother
every
thing

"
say
Rose
,
turn
round
toward
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
what

"
ask
Lomaque
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
say
what
I
say

"
reply
Rose
,
answer
for
her
brother

"
that
our

<EOS>
"
Shall

then

"
ask
Lomaque
,
with
a
meaning
look
at
Trudaine
.
  
<EOS>
Rose
glance
anxiously
at
her
brother
;
his
face
be
much
graver
than
she
have
expect
to
see
it
,
but
his
answer
relieve
her
from
all
suspense
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
quite
right
,
love

to
speak
as

he
say
,
gently
.
<EOS>
then
,
turn
to
Lomaque

he
add
,
in
a
firm
voice
,
"
It

after

with

<EOS>
give
him
time

<EOS>
this
may
be
a
case
of
strange
accidental

would
be
enough

under

audibly
for

dart
a
look
of
deadly
hatred
at
Lomaque

<EOS>
"
<EOS>

in

at

They
be
bring
to
the
bar
through
the
denunciation
of
Citizen
Danville

<EOS>
till
the
confession
of
the
male
prisoner

I
can
answer

Danville
's
not
be

charge

when
it

help
this

to
escape
from
France
,
and
when
Danville
's
own

in

I
myself
hear
him

a
false
assertion
that
he
have

Trudaine
's
conspiracy
from

do
you

<EOS>
"
I
do

Lomaque

<EOS>
(
a
murmur
of
horror

indignation
rise
from
all
the
stranger
present
at
that
reply

)
<EOS>
"
the
report

prove
the
truth

"
<EOS>
as
to
the
escape
of
Citizen
Trudaine
and
the
wife
of
Danville
from
the
guillotine
,
it
be
the
work
of
political
circumstance
,
which
there
be
person
live
to
speak
to
if
necessary
;
and
of
a
little
stratagem
of
mine

,
last
,
with

up
to
this
time

as
a
natural
measure
of
precaution
on
the
part
of

<EOS>
from
a
similar
motive
we
now
abstain
from
expose
his
sister
to
the
shock

the
peril
of
be
present
here
.
<EOS>
what
man
with
an
atom
of
feeling
would
risk
let
her
even
look
again
on
such
a
husband
as
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
glance
round
him
,
and
point
to
Danville
,
as
he
put
the
question
.
<EOS>
before
a
word
could
be
speak
by
any
one
else
in
the
room
,
a
low
wail
cry
of
"
My
mistress

<EOS>
my
dear

dear
mistress

<EOS>
"
direct
all
eye
first
on
the
old
man
Dubois

then
on
Madame
Danville

<EOS>
She
have
be
lean
against
the
wall
,
before
Lomaque
begin
to
speak

she
stand
perfectly
upright
now
.
<EOS>
She

<EOS>
not

the
light
gaudy

<EOS>
but
she
do
not
appear
to
know
that
he
be
near
her
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
when
her
son
advance
a
step
or
two
toward
her
that
she
seem
to
awaken
suddenly
from
that
death
-
trance
of
mental
pain
.
<EOS>
then
she
slowly
raise
the
hand
that
be
free
,
and
wave
him
back
from
her
.
<EOS>
He
stop
in
obedience
to
the
gesture
,
and
endeavor
to
speak
.
<EOS>
She
wave
her
hand
again
,
and
the
deathly
stillness
of
her
face
begin
to
grow
troubled
.
<EOS>
Her
lip
move
a
little

<EOS>
She
turn
her
back
on
him
;
and
,
bow
to
the
other
person
in
the
room
with
the
old
formal
courtesy
of
by

go
time

walk
slowly

steadily
to
the
door

<EOS>
stop
there

she
look
back

artificial
courage

<EOS>
with
a
faint

suppressed
cry
she
clutch
at
the
hand
of
the
old
servant

who
still
keep
faithfully
at
her
side

he
catch

sink
on

"

near
the
door

<EOS>
the

man
look
up
suspiciously
from
his
mistress
to
the
person
who
be
assist
him
to
support
her

<EOS>
with
a
strange
,
sudden
jealousy
he
shake
his
hand
at
them
.
"
<EOS>
home

"
he
cry
;
"

<EOS>
as
the
door
close
,
General
Berthelin
approach
Trudaine
,
who
have
stand
silent
and
apart
,
from
the
time
when
Lomaque
first
appear
in
the
drawing

room

<EOS>
"
I
wish
to

and
touch
him
on
the
shoulder

say
:
"

"
  
<EOS>
the
general
turn
on
his
heel
directly
,
and
beckon
contemptuously
to
Danville
to
follow
him
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
when
they
be
well
out
of
ear

shot
,
he
speak

<EOS>
They
have
do
their
duty
by
you

and
now
it
only
remain
for
me
to
do
mine

<EOS>
when
a
man
enter
the
house
of
another
under
false
pretense
,
and
compromise
the
reputation
of
his
daughter
,
we
old
army
man
have
a
very
expeditious
way
of
make
him
answer
for
it

<EOS>
It
be
just
three
o'clock
now
;
at
five
you
will
find
me

one
of
my
friend

<EOS>
He
stop
,
and
look
round
cautiously
 
then
whisper
the
rest
in
Danville
's
ear
 
throw
open
the
door
,
and
point
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Our
work
here
be

Lomaque
,
lay
his
hand
on
Trudaine

<EOS>
"
My

ask
Trudaine

I
will
tell
you
more

<EOS>
He
salute
the
company
,
with
his
usual
bluff
nod
of
the
head
,
and
enter
the
library
.
<EOS>
a
few
minute
afterward
,
Trudaine
and
Lomaque
leave
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
your

amazedly

<EOS>
surely

I
manage
it
so

she
should
be
see
,

should
not
see

<EOS>
Our
former
experience
of
Danville
suggest
to
me
the
propriety
of
make
the
experiment
,
and
my
old
police
-
office
practice
come
in
useful
in
carry
it
out
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
carriage
stand
at

get
in

and
walk
her
back
again
past
the
window
as
the
carriage
drive
off

<EOS>
a
moment
do
it
,
and
it
turn
out
as
useful
as
I
think
it
would

<EOS>
enough
of
that
!
<EOS>
go

<EOS>
three
more
day
have
pass
.
<EOS>
It
be
evening
.
<EOS>
Rose
,
Trudaine
and
Lomaque
be
seat
together
on
the
bench
that
overlook
the
winding
of
the
Seine
.
<EOS>
the
old
familiar
scene
spread
before
them
,
beautiful
as
ever
 
unchanged
,
as
if
it
be
but
yesterday
since
they
have
all
look
on
it
for
the
last
time
.
  
<EOS>
They
talk
together
seriously
and
in
low
voice
.
<EOS>
the
same
recollection
fill
their
heart
 
recollection
which
they
refrain
from
acknowledge
,
but
the
influence
of
which
each
know
by
instinct
that
the
other
partake
.
<EOS>
sometimes
one
lead
the
conversation
,
sometimes
another
;
but
whoever
speak
,
the
topic
choose
be
always
,
as
if
by
common
consent
,
a
topic
connect
with
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
the
evening
darken
in
,
and
Rose
be
the
first
to
rise
from
the
bench
.
<EOS>
a
secret
look
of
intelligence
pass
between
her
and
her
brother
,
and
then
she
speak
to
Lomaque
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
follow
me
into
the
house
,
"
she
ask
,
"
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
?
<EOS>
I
have
something
that
I
very
much
wish
to
show
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
brother
wait
till
she
be
out
of
hearing
,
then
inquire
anxiously
what
have
happen
at
Paris
since
the
night
when
he
and
Rose
leave
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
sister
be
free
,
"
Lomaque
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
duel
take
place
,
then
?
"
  
"
the
same
day
.
<EOS>
They
be
both
to
fire
together
.
<EOS>
the
second
of
his
adversary
assert
that
he
be
paralyze
with
terror
;
his
own
second
declare
that
he
be
resolve
,
however
he
may
have
live
,
to
confront
death
courageously
by
offer
his
life
at
the
first
fire
to
the
man
whom
he
have
injure
.
<EOS>
which
account
be
true
,
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
certain
that
he
do
not
discharge
his
pistol
,
that
he
fall
by
his
antagonist
's
first
bullet
,
and
that
he
never
speak
afterward
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
his
mother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
hard
to
gain
information
.
<EOS>
Her
door
be
closed
;
the
old
servant
guard
her
with
jealous
care
.
<EOS>
a
medical
man
be
in
constant
attendance
,
and
there
be
report
in
the
house
that
the
illness
from
which
she
be
suffer
affect
her
mind
more
than
her
body
.
<EOS>
I
could
ascertain
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
that
answer
they
both
remain
silent
for
a
little
while
,
then
rise
from
the
bench
and
walk
toward
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
think
yet
about
prepare
your
sister
to
hear
of
all
that
have
happen
?
"
<EOS>
Lomaque
ask
,
as
he
see
the
lamp
-
light
glimmering
in
the
parlor
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
wait
to
prepare
her
till
we
be

epilogue
to
the
third
STORY

<EOS>
I
have
now
relate
all
that
be
eventful
in
the
history
of
SISTER
ROSE
.
<EOS>
to
the
last
the
three
friend
dwelt
together
happily
in
the
cottage
on
the
river
bank
.
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
be
fortunate
enough
to
know
them
,
before
death
enter
the
little
household
and
take
away
,
in
the
fullness
of
time
,
the
eld
of
its
member
.
<EOS>
She
describe
Lomaque
,
in
her
quaint
foreign
English
,
as
"
a
brave
,
big
heart
"
;
generous
,
affectionate
,
and
admirably
free
from
the
small
obstinacy
and
prejudice
of
old
age
,
except
on
one
point
:
he
could
never
be
induce
to
take
his
coffee
,
of
an
evening
,
from
any
other
hand
than
the
hand
of
Sister
Rose
.
  
<EOS>
I
linger
over
these
final
particular
with
a
strange
unwillingness
to
separate
myself
from
them
,
and
give
my
mind
to
other
thought
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
person
and
event
that
have
occupy
my
attention
for
so
many
night
past
have
some
peculiar
interest
for
me
that
I
can
not
analyze
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
labor
and
time
which
this
story
have
cost
me
have
especially
endear
it
to
my
sympathy
,
now
that
I
have
succeed
in
complete
it
.
<EOS>
however
that
may
be
,
I
have
need
of
some
resolution
to
part
at
last
with
Sister
Rose
,
and
return
,
in
the
interest
of
my
next
and
Fourth
Story
,
to
english
ground
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
experience
so
much
difficulty
,
let
me
add
,
in
decide
on
the
choice
of
a
new
narrative
out
of
my
collection
,
that
my
wife
have
lose
all
patience
,
and
have
undertake
,
on
her
own
responsibility
,
to
relieve
me
of
my
unreasonable
perplexity
.
<EOS>
by
her
advice
 
give
,
as
usual

without

moment
's
hesitation
 
I
can

do
well
than
tell
the
story
of
  
<EOS>

PROLOGUE

fourth
STORY

My
practice
in

if
it

do
nothing
else

have
at

fit
me
to
turn
my
talent
(
such
as
they
be
)
to
a
great
variety
of
use
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
only
take
the
likeness
of
man
,
woman
,
and
child
,
but
have
also
extend
the
range
of
my
brush
,
under
stress
of
circumstance
,
to
horse
,
dog
,
house
,
and
in
one
case
even
to
a
bull
 
<EOS>
the
terror
and
glory
of
his
parish
,
and
the
most
truculent
sitter
I
ever
have
.
<EOS>
the
beast
be
appropriately
name
"
Thunder

lightning
,
"
and
be
the
property
of
a
gentleman
-
farmer
name
Garthwaite
,
a
distant
connection
of
my
wife
's
family
.
  
<EOS>
how
it
be
that
I
escape
be
gore
to
death
before
I
have
finish
my
picture
be
more
than
I
can
explain
to
this
day
.
<EOS>
"
thunder
and
lightning
"
resent
the
very
sight
of
me
and
my
color
-
box
,
as
if
he
view
the
taking
of
his
likeness
in
the
light
of
a
personal
insult
.
<EOS>
It
require
two
man
to
coax
him
,
while
a
third
hold
him
by
a
ring
in
his
nostril
,
before
I
could
venture
on
begin
to
work
.
<EOS>
even
then
he
always
lash
his
tail
,
and
jerk
his
huge
head
,
and
roll
his
fiery
eye
with
a
devour
anxiety
to
have
me
on
his
horn
for
dare
to
sit
down
quietly
and
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
never
,
I
can
honestly
say
,
do
I
feel
more
heartily
grateful
for
the
blessing
of
soundness
of
limb
and
wholeness
of
skin
,
than
when
I
have
complete
the
picture
of
the
bull
!
  
<EOS>
one
morning
,
when
I
have
but
little
more
than
half
do
my
unwelcome
task
,
my
friend
and
I
<EOS>
be
meet
on
our
way
to
the
bull
's
stable
by
the
farm
bailiff
,
who
inform
us
gravely
that
"
Thunder
and
lightning
"
be
just
then
in
such
an
especially
surly
state
of
temper
as
to
render
it
quite
unsafe
for
me
to
think
of
paint
him
.
<EOS>
I
look
inquiringly
at
Mr.
Garthwaite
,
who
smile
with
an
air
of
comic
resignation
,
and
say
,
"
very
well
,
then
,
we
have
nothing
for
it
but
to
wait
till
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
say
to
a
morning
's
fishing
,
Mr.
Kerby
,
now
that
my
bull
's
bad
temper
have
give
us
a
holiday
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
reply
,
with
perfect
truth
,
that
I
know
nothing
about
fishing
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Garthwaite
,
who
be
as
ardent
<EOS>
an
angler
in
his
way
as
Izaak
Walton
himself
,
be
not
to
be
appease
even
by
the
good
of
excuse
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
never
too
late
to
learn
,
"
cry
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
make
a
fisherman
of
you
in
no
time
,
if
you
will
only
attend
to
my
direction
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
impossible
for
me
to
make
any
more
apology
,
without
the
risk
of
appeal
discourteous
.
<EOS>
so
I
thank
my
host
for
his
friendly
intention
,
and
,
with
some
secret
misgiving
,
accept
the
first
fishing
-
rod
that
he
put
into
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
soon
get
there
,
"
say
Mr.
Garthwaite
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
take
you
to
the
good
mill
-
stream
in
the
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
one
to
me
whether
we
get
there
soon
or
late
and
whether
the
stream
be
good
or
bad
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
do
my
good
to
conceal
my
unsportsman
-
like
apathy
;
and
try
to
look
quite
happy
and
very
impatient
to
begin
,
as
we
draw
near
to
the
mill
,
and
hear
louder
and
louder
the
gushing
of
many
water
all
round
it
.
  
<EOS>
lead
the
way
immediately
to
a
place
beneath
the
fall
stream
,
where
there
be
a
deep
,
eddy
pool
,
Mr.
Garthwaite
bait
and
throw
in
his
line
before
I
have
fix
the
joint
of
my
fishing
-
rod
.
<EOS>
this
first
difficulty
overcome
,
I
involuntarily
plunge
into
some
excellent
,
but
rather
embarrassing
,
sport
with
my
line
and
hook
.
<EOS>
I
catch
every
one
of
my
garment
,
from
head
to
foot
;
I
angle
for
my
own
clothe
with
the
dexterity
and
success
of
Izaak
Walton
himself
.
<EOS>
I
catch
my
hat
,
my
jacket
,
my
waistcoat
,
my
trouser
,
my
finger
,
and
my
thumb
 
<EOS>
some
devil
possess
my
hook
;
some
more
than
eel
-
like
vitality
twirl
and
twist
in
every
inch
of
my
line
.
<EOS>
by
the
time
my
host
arrive
to
assist
me
,
I
have
attach
myself
to
my
fishing
-
rod
,
apparently
for
life
.
<EOS>
all
difficulty
yield
,
however
,
to
his
patience
and
skill
;
my
hook
be
bait
for
me
,
and
throw
in
;
my
rod
be
put
into
my
hand
;
my
friend
go
back
to
his
place
;
and
we
begin
at
last
to
angle
in
earnest
.
  
<EOS>
We
certainly
catch
a
few
fish
(
in
my
case
,
I
mean
,
of
course
,
that
the
fish
catch
themselves
)
;
but
they
be
scanty
in
number
and
light
in
weight
.
<EOS>
whether
it
be
the
presence
of
the
miller
's
foreman
 
a
gloomy
personage
,
who
stand
stare
disastrously
upon
us
from
a
little
flower
-
garden
on
the
opposite
bank
 
<EOS>
that
cast
adverse
influence
over
our
sport
;
or
whether
my
want
of
faith
and
earnestness
as
an
angler
act
retributively
on
my
companion
as
well
as
myself
,
I
know
not
;
but
it
be
certain
that
he
get
almost
as
little
reward
for
his
skill
as
I
get
for
my
patience
.
<EOS>
after
nearly
two
hour
of
intense
expectation
on
my
part
,
and
intense
angling
on
his
,
Mr.
Garthwaite
jerk
his
line
out
of
the
water
in
a
rage
,
and
bade
me
follow
him
to
another
place
,
declare
that
the
stream
must
have
be
net
by
poacher
in
the
night
,
who
have
take
all
the
large
fish
away
with
them
,
and
have
throw
in
the
small
one
to
grow
until
their
next
visit
.
<EOS>
We
move
away
,
further
down
the
bank
,
leave
the
imperturbable
foreman
still
in
the
flower
-
garden
,
stare
at
us
speechlessly
on
our
departure
,
exactly
as
he
have
already
stare
at
us
on
our
approach
.
  
<EOS>
"
stop
a
minute
,
"
say
Mr.
Garthwaite
suddenly
,
after
we
have
walk
some
distance
in
silence
by
the
side
of
the
stream
,
"
I
have
an
idea
.
<EOS>
now
we
be
out
for
a
day
's
angling
,
we
will
not
be
balk
.
<EOS>
instead
of
try
the
water
here
again
,
we
will
go
where
I
know
,
by
experience
,
that
the
fishing
be
excellent
.
<EOS>
and
what
be
more
,
you
shall
be
introduce
to
a
lady
whose
appearance
be
sure
to
interest
you
,
and
whose
history
,
I
can
tell
you
beforehand
,
be
a
very
remarkable
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
in
what
way
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
connect
,
"
answer
Mr.
Garthwaite
,
"
with
an
extraordinary
story
,
which
relate
to
a
family
once
settle
in
an
old
house
in
this
neighborhood

Her
name
be
Miss
Welwyn

she
be
less

poor
people
about

who
love
her
dearly
,
and
honor
her
almost
superstitiously
,
as
the
Lady
of
Glenwith
Grange
.
<EOS>
wait
till
you
have
see
her
before
you
ask
me
to
say
anything
more
.
<EOS>
She
live
in
the
strict
retirement
;
I
be
almost
the
only
visitor
who
be
admit
.
<EOS>
do
not
say
you
have
rather
not
go
in
.
<EOS>
any
friend
of
mine
will
be
welcome
at
the
Grange
(
the
scene
of
the
story
,
remember
)
,
for
my
sake
 
the
more
especially
because
I
have
never
abuse
my
privilege
of
introduction
.
<EOS>
the
place
be
not
above
two
mile
from
here
,
and
the
stream
(
which
we
call
,
in
our
county
dialect
,
Glenwith
Beck
)
run
through
the
ground

"
  
<EOS>
as
we
walk
on
,
Mr.
Garthwaite
's
manner
alter
.
<EOS>
He
become
unusually
silent
and
thoughtful
.
<EOS>
the
mention
of
Miss
Welwyn
's
name
have
evidently
call
up
some
recollection
which
be
not
in
harmony
with
his
every
-
day
mood
.
<EOS>
feel
that
to
talk
to
him
on
any
indifferent
subject
would
be
only
to
interrupt
his
thought
to
no
purpose

I
walk
by
his
side
in
perfect
silence
,
look
out
already
with
some
curiosity
and
impatience
for
a
first
view
of
Glenwith
Grange
.
<EOS>
We
stop
at
last
close
by
an
old
church
,
stand
on
the
outskirt
of
a
pretty
village
.
<EOS>
the
low
wall
of
the
churchyard
be
bound
on
one
side
by
a
plantation
,
and
be
join
by
a
park
paling
,
in
which
I
notice
a
small
wicket
-
gate
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Garthwaite
open
it
,
and
lead
me
along
a
shrubbery
path
,
which
conduct
us
circuitously
to
the
dwelling
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
evidently
enter
by
a
private
way
,
for
we
approach
the
building
by
the
back
.
<EOS>
I
look
up
at
it
curiously
,
and
see
stand
at
one
of
the
window
on
the
low
floor
a
little
girl
watch
us
as
we
advance
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
be
about
nine
or
ten
year
old
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
stop
a
moment
to
look
up
at
her
,
her
clear
complexion
and
her
long
dark
hair
be
so
beautiful
.
<EOS>
and
yet
there
be
something
in
her
expression
 
a
dimness
and
vacancy
in
her
large
eye
 
a
changeless
,
unmeane
smile
on
her
part
lip
 
which
seem
to
jar
with
all
that
be
naturally
attractive
in
her
face
;
which
perplex
,
disappoint
,
and
even
shock
me
,
though
I
hardy
<EOS>
know
why
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Garthwaite
,
who
have
be
walk
along
thoughtfully
,
with
his
eye
on
the
ground
,
turn
back
when
he
find
me
linger
behind
him
;
look
up
where
I
be
look
;
start
a
little
,
I
think
;
then
take
my
arm
,
whisper
rather
impatiently
,
"
do
not
say
anything
about
have
see
that
poor
child
when
you
be
introduce
to
Miss
Welwyn
<EOS>
;
I
will
tell
you
why
afterward
,
"
and
lead
me
round
hastily
to
the
front
of
the
building
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
dreary
old
house
,
with
a
lawn
in
front
thickly
sprinkle
with
flower
-
bed
,
and
creeper
of
all
sort
climb
in
profusion
about
the
heavy
stone
porch
and
the
mullion
of
the
low
window
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
these
prettiest
of
all
ornament
cluster
brightly
round
the
building
 
in
spite
of
the
perfect
repair
in
which
it
be
keep
from
top
to
bottom
 
there
be
something
repellent
to
me
in
the
aspect
of
the
whole
place
:
a
deathly
stillness
hang
over
it
,
which
fall
oppressively
on
my
spirit
.
<EOS>
when
my
companion
ring
the
loud
,
deep
-
toned
bell
,
the
sound
startle
me
as
if
we
have
be
commit
a
crime
in
disturb
the
silence
.
<EOS>
and
when
the
door
be
open
by
an
old
female
servant
(
while
the
hollow
echo
of
the
bell
be
still
vibrate
in
the
air
)
,
I
could
hardly
imagine
it
possible
that
we
should
be
let
in
.
<EOS>
We
be
admit
,
however
,
without
the
slight
demur
.
<EOS>
I
remark
that
there
be
the
same
atmosphere
of
dreary
repose
inside
the
house
which
I
have
already
observe
,
or
rather
feel
,
outside
it
.
<EOS>
no
dog
bark
at
our
approach
 
<EOS>
no
door
bang
in
the
servant
'
office
 
no
head
peep
over
the
banister
 
<EOS>
not
one
of
the
ordinary
domestic
consequence
of
an
unexpected
visit
in
the
country
meet
either
eye
or
ear
.
<EOS>
the
large
shadowy
apartment
,
half
library
,
half
breakfast
-
room
,
into
which
we
be
usher
,
be
as
solitary
as
the
hall
of
entrance
;
unless
I
except
such
drowsy
evidence
of
life
as
be
here
present
to
us
in
the
shape
of
an
angola
cat
and
a
gray
parrot
 
the
first
lie
asleep
in
a
chair
,
the
second
sit
ancient
,
solemn
,
and
voiceless
,
in
a
large
cage
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Garthwaite
walk
to
the
window
when
we
enter
,
without
say
a
word
.
<EOS>
determine
to
let
his
taciturn
humor
have
its
way
,
I
ask
him
no
question
,
but
look
around
the
room
to
see
what
information
it
would
give
me
(
and
room
often
do
give
such
information
)
about
the
character
and
habit
of
the
owner
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
two
table
cover
with
book
be
the
first
object
that
attract
me
.
<EOS>
on
approach
them
,
I
be
surprised
to
find
that
the
all
-
influence
periodical
literature
of
the
present
day
 
whose
sphere
be
already
almost
without
limit
;
whose
reader
,
even
in
our
time
,
may
be
number
by
million
 
be
entirely
unrepresented
on
Miss
Welwyn
's
table
.
<EOS>
nothing
modern
,
nothing
contemporary
,
in
the
world
of
book
,
present
itself
.
<EOS>
of
all
the
volume
beneath
my
hand
,
not
one
bore
the
badge
of
the
circulate
library
,
or
wear
the
flare
modern
livery
of
gilt
cloth
.
<EOS>
every
work
that
I
take
up
have
be
write
at
least
fifteen
or
twenty
year
since
.
<EOS>
the
print
hang
round
the
wall
(
toward
which
I
next
look
)
be
all
engrave
from
devotional
subject
by
the
old
master
;
the
music
-
stand
contain
no
music
of
later
date
than
the
composition
of
Haydn
and
Mozart
.
<EOS>
whatever
I
examine
besides
,
tell
me
,
with
the
same
consistency
,
the
same
strange
tale
.
<EOS>
the
owner
of
these
possession
live
in
the
by
-
go
time
;
live
among
old
recollection
and
old
association
 
a
voluntary
recluse
from
all
that
be
connect
with
the
pass
day
.
<EOS>
in
Miss
Welwyn
's
house
,
the
stir
,
the
tumult
,
the
"
idle
business
"
of
the
world
evidently
appeal
in
vain
to
sympathy
which
grow
no
longer
with
the
grow
hour
.
  
<EOS>
as
these
thought
be
pass
through
my
mind
,
the
door
open
and
the
lady
herself
appear
.
  
<EOS>
She
look
certainly
past
the
prime
of
life
;
longer
past
it
,
as
I
afterward
discover
,
than
she
really
be
.
<EOS>
but
I
never
remember
,
in
any
other
face
,
to
have
see
so
much
of
the
well
part
of
the
beauty
of
early
womanhood
still
remain
,
as
I
see
in
hers
.
<EOS>
sorrow
have
evidently
pass
over
the
fair
,
calm
countenance
before
me
,
but
have
leave
resignation
there
as
its
only
trace
.
<EOS>
Her
expression
be
still
youthful
 
youthful
in
its
kindness
and
its
candor
especially
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
when
I
look
at
her
hair
,
that
be
now
grow
gray
 
at
her
wan
,
thin
hand
 
at
the
faint
line
mark
round
her
mouth
 
at
the
sad
serenity
of
her
eye
,
that
I
fairly
detect
the
mark
of
age
;
and
,
more
than
that
,
the
token
of
some
great
grief
,
which
have
be
conquer
,
but
not
banish
.
<EOS>
even
from
her
voice
alone
 
from
the
peculiar
uncertainty
of
its
low
,
calm
tone
when
she
speak
 
it
be
easy
to
conjecture
that
she
must
have
pass
through
suffering
,
at
some
time
of
her
life
,
which
have
try
to
the
quick
the
noble
nature
that
they
could
not
subdue
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Garthwaite
and
she
meet
each
other
almost
like
brother
and
sister
;
it
be
plain
that
the
friendly
intimacy
between
them
have
be
of
very
long
duration
.
<EOS>
Our
visit
be
a
short
one
.
<EOS>
the
conversation
never
advance
beyond
the
commonplace
topic
suit
to
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
therefore
,
from
what
I
see
,
and
not
from
what
I
hear
,
that
I
be
enable
to
form
my
judgment
of
Miss
Welwyn
.
<EOS>
deeply
as
she
have
interest
me
 
far
more
deeply
than
I
at
all
know
how
to
explain
in
fitting
word
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
I
be
unwilling
to
depart
when
we
rise
to
take
leave
.
<EOS>
though
nothing
could
be
more
courteous
and
more
kind
than
her
manner
toward
me
during
the
whole
interview
,
I
could
still
perceive
that
it
cost
her
some
effort
to
repress
in
my
presence
the
shade
of
sadness
and
reserve
which
seem
often
ready
to
steal
over
her
.
<EOS>
and
I
must
confess
that
when
I
once
or
twice
hear
the
half
-
sigh
stifled
,
and
see
the
momentary
relapse
into
thoughtfulness
suddenly
restrain
,
I
feel
an
indefinable
awkwardness
in
my
position
which
make
me
ill
at
ease
;
which
set
me
doubt
whether
,
as
a
perfect
stranger
,
I
have
do
right
in
suffer
myself
to
be
introduce
where
no
new
face
could
awaken
either
interest
or
curiosity
;
where
no
new
sympathy
could
ever
be
feel
,
no
new
friendship
ever
be
form
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
have
take
leave
of
Miss
Welwyn
,
and
be
on
our
way
to
the
stream
in
her
ground
,
I
more
than
satisfied
Mr.
Garthwaite
that
the
impression
the
lady
have
produce
on
me
be
of
no
transitory
kind
,
by
overwhelm
him
with
question
about
her
 
not
omit
one
or
two
incidental
inquiry
on
the
subject
of
the
little
girl
whom
I
have
see
at
the
back
window
.
<EOS>
He
only
rejoin
that
his
story
would
answer
all
my
question
;
and
that
he
would
begin
to
tell
it
as
soon
as
we
have
arrive
at
Glenwith
Beck
,
and
be
comfortably
settle
to
fishing
.
  
<EOS>
five
minute
more
of
walk
bring
us
to
the
bank
of
the
stream
,
and
show
us
the
water
run
smoothly
and
slowly
,
tinge
with
the
soft
green
luster
from
the
reflection
of
tree
which
almost
entirely
arch
it
over
.
<EOS>
leave
me
to
admire
the
view
at
my
ease
,
Mr.
Garthwaite
occupy
himself
with
the
necessary
preparation
for
angle
,
bait
my
hook
as
well
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
then
,
desire
me
to
sit
near
him
on
the
bank
,
he
at
last
satisfy
my
curiosity
by
begin
his
story
.
<EOS>
I
shall
relate
it
in
his
own
manner
,
and
,
as
nearly
as
possible
,
in
his
own
word
.
  
<EOS>
the
ANGLER
's
STORY
  
of
  
<EOS>
the
lady
of
GLENWITH
GRANGE
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
know
Miss
Welwyn
long
enough
to
be
able
to
bear
personal
testimony
to
the
truth
of
many
of
the
particular
which
I
be
now
about
to
relate
.
<EOS>
I
know
her
father
,
and
her
young
sister
Rosamond
;
and
I
be
acquaint
with
the
Frenchman
who
become
Rosamond
's
husband
.
<EOS>
these
be
the
person
of
whom
it
will
be
principally
necessary
for
me
to
speak
.
<EOS>
They
be
the
only
prominent
character
in
my
story
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Welwyn
's
father
die
some
year
since
.
<EOS>
I
remember
him
very
well
 
though
he
never
excite
in
me
,
or
in
any
one
else
that
I
ever
hear
of
,
the
slight
feeling
of
interest
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
say
that
he
inherit
a
very
large
fortune
,
amass
during
his
father
's
time
,
by
speculation
of
a
very
daring
,
very
fortunate
,
but
not
always
very
honorable
kind
,
and
that
he
buy
this
old
house
with
the
notion
of
raise
his
social
position
,
by
make
himself
a
member
of
our
land
aristocracy
in
these
part
<EOS>
,
I
have
tell
you
as
much
about
him
,
I
suspect
,
as
you
would
care
to
hear
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
thoroughly
commonplace
man
,
with
no
great
virtue
and
no
great
vice
in
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
little
heart
,
a
feeble
mind
,
an
amiable
temper
,
a
tall
figure
,
and
a
handsome
face
.
<EOS>
More
than
this
need
not
,
and
can
not
,
be
say
on
the
subject
of
Mr.
Welwyn
's
character
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
have
see
the
late
Mrs.
Welwyn
very
often
as
a
child
;
but
I
can
not
say
that
I
remember
anything
more
of
her
than
that
she
be
tall
and
handsome
,
and
very
generous
and
sweet
-
tempered
toward
me
when
I
be
in
her
company
.
<EOS>
She
be
her
husband
's
superior
in
birth
,
as
in
everything
else
;
be
a
great
reader
of
book
in
all
language
;
and
possess
such
admirable
talent
as
a
musician
,
that
her
wonderful
playing
on
the
organ
be
remember
and
talk
of
to
this
day
among
the
old
people
in
our
country
house
about
here
.
<EOS>
all
her
friend
,
as
I
have
hear
,
be
disappoint
when
she
marry
Mr.
Welwyn
,
rich
as
he
be
;
and
be
afterward
astonish
to
find
her
preserve
the
appearance
,
at
least
,
of
be
perfectly
happy
with
a
husband
who
,
neither
in
mind
nor
heart
,
be
worthy
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
generally
suppose
(
and
I
have
no
doubt
correctly
)
that
she
find
her
great
happiness
and
her
great
consolation
in
her
little
girl
<EOS>
Ida
 
now
the
lady
from
whom
we
have
just
part
.
<EOS>
the
child
take
after
her
mother
from
the
first
 
inherit
her
mother
's
fondness
for
book
,
her
mother
's
love
of
music
,
her
mother
's
quick
sensibility
,
and
,
more
than
all
,
her
mother
's
quiet
firmness
,
patience
,
and
love
kindness
of
disposition
.
<EOS>
from
Ida
's
early
year
,
Mrs.
Welwyn
undertake
the
whole
superintendence
of
her
education
.
<EOS>
the
two
be
hardly
ever
apart
,
within
door
or
without
.
<EOS>
neighbor
and
friend
say
that
the
little
girl
be
be
bring
up
too
fancifully
,
and
be
not
enough
among
other
child
,
be
sadly
neglect
as
to
all
reasonable
and
practical
teaching
,
and
be
perilously
encourage
in
those
dreamy
and
imaginative
tendency
of
which
she
have
naturally
more
than
her
due
share
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
perhaps
,
some
truth
in
this
;
and
there
may
have
be
still
more
,
if
Ida
have
possess
an
ordinary
character
,
or
have
be
reserve
for
an
ordinary
destiny
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
a
strange
child
from
the
first
,
and
a
strange
future
be
in
store
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
Little
Ida
reach
her
eleventh
year
without
either
brother
or
sister
to
be
her
playfellow
and
companion
at
home
.
<EOS>
immediately
after
that
period
,
however
,
her
sister
Rosamond
be
bear
.
<EOS>
though
Mr.
Welwyn
's
own
desire
be
to
have
have
a
son
,
there
be
,
nevertheless
,
great
rejoicing
yonder
in
the
old
house
on
the
birth
of
this
second
daughter
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
all
turn
,
only
a
few
month
afterward
,
to
the
bitter
grief
and
despair
:
the
Grange
lose
its
mistress
.
<EOS>
while
Rosamond
be
still
an
infant
in
arm
,
her
mother
die
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Welwyn
have
be
afflict
with
some
disorder
after
the
birth
of
her
second
child
,
the
name
of
which
I
be
not
learn
enough
in
medical
science
to
be
able
to
remember
.
<EOS>
I
only
know
that
she
recover
from
it
,
to
all
appearance
,
in
an
unexpectedly
short
time
;
that
she
suffer
a
fatal
relapse
,
and
that
she
die
a
lingering
and
a
painful
death
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Welwyn
(
who
,
in
after
year
,
have
a
habit
of
vaingloriously
describe
his

in

I

wait
here
and
see

<EOS>
"
there
happen
to
be
an
aunt
of
Mrs.
Welwyn
,
and
an
old
servant
of
the
family
,
in
the
house
at
this
time
,
who
understand
Ida
much
better
than
her
father
do
,
and
they
persuade
him
not
to
take
her
away
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
my
mother
say
that
the
effect
of
the
child
's
appearance
at
the
funeral
on
her
,
and
on
all
who
go
to
see
it
,
be
something
that
she
could
never
think
of
without
the
tear
come
into
her
eye
,
and
could
never
forget
to
the
last
day
of
her
life
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
have
be
very
shortly
after
this
period
that
I
see
Ida
for
the
first
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
accompany
my
mother
on
a
visit
to
the
old
house
we
have
just
leave
,
in
the
summer
,
when
I
be
at
home
for
the
holiday
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
lovely
,
sunshiny
morning
.
<EOS>
there
be
nobody
indoor
,
and
we
walk
out
into
the
garden
.
<EOS>
as
we
approach
that
lawn
yonder
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
shrubbery
,
I
see
,
first
,
a
young
woman
in
mourning
(
apparently
a
servant
)
<EOS>
sit
reading
;
then
a
little
girl
,
dress
all
in
black
,
move
toward
us
slowly
over
the
bright
turf
,
and
hold
up
before
her
a
baby
,
whom
she
be
try
to
teach
to
walk
.
<EOS>
She
look
,
to
my
idea
,
so
very
young
to
be
engage
in
such
an
occupation
as
this
,
and
her
gloomy
black
frock
appear
to
be
such
an
unnaturally
grave
garment
for
a
mere
child
of
her
age
,
and
look
so
doubly
dismal
by
contrast
with
the
brilliant
sunny
lawn
on
which
she
stand
,
that
I
quite
start
when
I
first
see
her
,
and
eagerly
ask
my
mother
who
she
be
.
<EOS>
the
answer
inform
me
of
the
sad
family
story
,
which
I
have
be
just
relate
to
you
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Welwyn
have
then
be
bury
about
three
month
;
and
Ida
,
in
her
childish
way
,
be
try
,
as
she
have
promise
,
to
supply
her
mother
's
place
to
her
infant
sister
Rosamond
.
  
<EOS>
I
only
mention
this
simple
incident
,
because
it
be
necessary
,
before
I
proceed
to
the
eventful
part
of
my
narrative
,
that
you
should
know
exactly
in
what
relation
the
sister
stand
toward
one
another
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
of
all
the
last
parting
word
that
Mrs.
Welwyn
have
speak
to
her
child
,
none
have
be
oftener
repeat
,
none
more
solemnly
urge
,
than
those
which
have
commend
the
little
rosamond
to
Ida
's
love
and
care
.
<EOS>
to
other
person
,
the
full
,
the
all
-
trust
dependence
which
the
die
mother
be
know
to
have
place
in
a
child
hardly
eleven
year
old
,
seem
merely
a
proof
of
that
helpless
desire
to
cling
even
to
the
feeble
consolation
,
which
the
approach
of
death
so
often
bring
with
it
.
<EOS>
but
the
event
show
that
the
trust
so
strangely
place
have
not
be
venture
vainly
when
it
be
commit
to
young
and
tender
hand
.
<EOS>
the
whole
future
existence
of
the
child
be
one
noble
proof
that
she
have
be
worthy
of
her
mother
's
die
confidence
,
when
it
be
first
repose
in
her
.
<EOS>
in
that
simple
incident
which
I
have
just
mention
the
new
life
of
the
two
motherless
sister
be
all
foreshadow
.
  
<EOS>
Time
pass
.
<EOS>
I
leave
school
 
<EOS>
go
to
college
 
travel
in
Germany
,
and
stay
there
some
time
to
learn
the
language
.
<EOS>
at
every
interval
when
I
come
home
,
and
ask
about
the
Welwyns
,
the
answer
be
,
in
substance
,
almost
always
the
same
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Welwyn
be
give
his
regular
dinner
,
perform
his
regular
duty
as
a
county
magistrate
,
enjoy
his
regular
recreation
as
an
a
amateur
farmer
and
an
eager
sportsman
.
<EOS>
His
two
daughter
be
never
separate
.
<EOS>
Ida
be
the
same
strange
,
quiet
,
retire
girl
,
that
she
have
always
be
;
and
be
still
(
as
the
phrase
go
)
<EOS>
"
spoil
"
Rosamond
in
every
way
in
which
it
be
possible
for
an
eld
sister
to
spoil
a
young
by
too
much
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
I
myself
go
to
the
Grange
occasionally
,
when
I
be
in
this
neighborhood
,
in
holiday
and
vacation
time
;
and
be
able
to
test
the
correctness
of
the
picture
of
life
there
which
have
be
draw
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
remember
the
two
sister
,
when
Rosamond
be
four
or
five
year
old
;
and
when
Ida
seem
to
me
,
even
then
,
to
be
more
like
the
child
's
mother
than
her
sister
.
<EOS>
She
bear
with
her
little
caprice
as
sister
do
not
bear
with
one
another
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
patient
at
lesson
-
time
,
so
anxious
to
conceal
any
weariness
that
may
overcome
her
in
play
hour
,
so
proud
when
Rosamond
's
beauty
be
notice
,
so
grateful
for
Rosamond
's
kiss
when
the
child
think
of
bestow
them
,
so
quick
to
notice
all
that
Rosamond
do
,
and
to
attend
to
<EOS>
all
that
Rosamond
say
,
even
when
visitor
be
in
the
room
,
that
she
seem
,
to
my
boyish
observation
,
altogether
different
from
other
eld
sister
in
other
family
circle
into
which
I
be
then
receive
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
then
,
again
,
when
Rosamond
be
just
grow
to
womanhood
,
and
be
in
high
spirit
at
the
prospect
of
spend
a
season
in
London
,
and
be
present
at
court
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
beautiful
at
that
time
 
much
handsome
than
Ida
.
<EOS>
Her
"
accomplishment
"
be
talk
of
far
and
near
in
our
country
circle
.
<EOS>
few
,
if
any
,
of
the
people
,
however
,
who
applaud
her
playing
and
singing
,
who
admire
her
water
-
color
drawing
,
who
be
delighted
at
her
fluency
when
she
speak
French
,
and
amazed
at
her
ready
comprehension
when
she
read
german
,
know
how
little
of
all
this
elegant
mental
cultivation
and
nimble
manual
dexterity
she
owe
to
her
governess
and
master
,
and
how
much
to
her
eld
sister
.
<EOS>
It
be
Ida
who
really
find
out
the
mean
of
stimulate
her
when
she
be
idle
;
Ida
who
help
her
through
all
her
bad
difficulty
;
Ida
who
gently
conquer
her
defect
of
memory
over
her
book
,
her
inaccuracy
of
ear
at
the
piano
,
her
error
of
taste
when
she
take
the
brush
and
pencil
in
hand
.
<EOS>
It
be
Ida
alone
who
work
these
marvel
,
and
<EOS>
whose
all
-
sufficient
reward
for
her
hard
exertion
be
a
chance
word
of
kindness
from
her
sister
's
lip
.
<EOS>
Rosamond
be
not
unaffectionate
,
and
not
ungrateful
;
but
she
inherit
much
of
her
father
's
commonness
and
frivolity
of
character
.
<EOS>
She
become
so
accustomed
to
owe
everything
to
her
sister
 
to
resign
all
her
most
trifling
difficulty
to
Ida
's
ever
-
ready
care
 
to
have
all
her
taste
consult
by
Ida
's
ever
-
watchful
kindness
 
that
she
never
appreciate
,
as
it
deserve
,
the
deep
,
devoted
love
of
which
she
be
the
object
.
<EOS>
when
Ida
refuse
two
good
offer
of
marriage
,
Rosamond
be
as
much
astonish
as
the
veri
stranger
,
who
wonder
why
the
elder
Miss
Welwyn
seem
bent
on
remain
single
all
her
life
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
journey
to
London
,
to
which
I
have
already
allude
,
take
place
,
Ida
accompany
her
father
and
sister
.
<EOS>
if
she
have
consult
her
own
taste
,
she
would
have
remain
in
the
country
;
but
Rosamond
declare
that
she
should
feel
quite
lost
and
helpless
twenty
time
a
day
,
in
town
,
without
her
sister
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
nature
of
Ida
to
sacrifice
herself
to
any
one
whom
she
love
,
on
the
small
occasion
as
well
as
the
great
.
<EOS>
Her
affection
be
as
intuitively
ready
to
sanctify
Rosamond
's
slight
caprice
as
to
excuse
Rosamond
's
most
thoughtless
fault
.
<EOS>
so
she
go
to
London
cheerfully
,
to
witness
with
pride
all
the
little
triumph
win
by
her
sister
's
beauty
;
to
hear
,
and
never
tire
of
hearing
,
all
that
admire
friend
could
say
in
her
sister
's
praise
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
the
season
Mr.
Welwyn
and
his
daughter
return
for
a
short
time
to
the
country
;
then
leave
home
again
to
spend
the
latter
part
of
the
autumn
and
the
beginning
of
the
winter
in
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
They
take
with
them
excellent
letter
of
introduction
,
and
see
a
great
deal
of
the
good
society
in
Paris
,
foreign
as
well
as
English
.
<EOS>
at
one
of
the
first
of
the
evening
party
which
they
attend
,
the
general
topic
of
conversation
be
the
conduct
of
a
certain
french
nobleman
,
the
Baron
Franval
,
who
have
return
to
his
native
country
after
a
long
absence
,
and
who
be
speak
of
in
term
of
high
eulogy
by
the
majority
of
the
guest
present
.
<EOS>
the
history
of
who
Franval
be
,
and
of
what
he
have
do
,
be
readily
communicate
to
Mr.
Welwyn
and
his
daughter
,
and
be
briefly
this
:
  
<EOS>
the
baron
inherit
little
from
his
ancestor
besides
his
high
rank
and
his
ancient
pedigree
.
<EOS>
on
the
death
of
his
parent
,
he
and
his
two
unmarried
sister
(
their
only
survive
child
)
find
the
small
territorial
property
of
the
Franvals
,
in
Normandy
,
barely
productive
enough
to
afford
a
comfortable
subsistence
for
the
three
.
<EOS>
the
baron
,
then
a
young
man
of
three
-
and
-
twenty
endeavor
to
obtain
such
military
or
civil
employment
as
may
become
his
rank
;
but
,
although
the
Bourbons
be
at
that
time
restore
to
the
throne
of
France
,
his
effort
be
ineffectual
.
<EOS>
either
his
interest
at
court
be
bad
,
or
secret
enemy
be
at
work
to
oppose
his
advancement
.
<EOS>
He
fail
to
obtain
even
the
slight
favor
;
and
,
irritate
by
undeserved
neglect
,
resolve
to
leave
France
,
and
seek
occupation
for
his
energy
in
foreign
country
,
where
his
rank
would
be
no
bar
to
his
better
his
fortune
,
if
he
please
,
by
engage
in
commercial
pursuit
.
  
<EOS>
an
opportunity
of
the
kind
that
he
want
unexpectedly
offer
itself
.
<EOS>
He
leave
his
sister
in
care
of
an
old
male
relative
of
the
family
at
the
chateau
in
Normandy
,
and
sail
,
in
the
first
instance
,
to
the
West
Indies
;
afterward
extend
his
wandering
to
the
continent
of
South
America
,
and
there
engage
in
mining
transaction
on
a
very
large
scale
.
<EOS>
after
fifteen
year
of
absence
(
during
the
latter
part
of
which
time
false
report
of
his
death
have
reach
Normandy
)
,
he
have
just
return
to
France
,
have
realize
a
handsome
independence
,
with
which
he
propose
to
widen
the
limit
of
his
ancestral
property
,
and
to
give
his
sister
(
who
be
still
,
like
himself
,
unmarrie
)
all
the
luxury
and
advantage
that
affluence
could
bestow
.
<EOS>
the
baron
's
independent
spirit
and
generous
devotion
to
the
honor
of
his
family
and
the
happiness
of
his
survive
relative
be
theme
of
general
admiration
in
most
of
the
social
circle
of
Paris
.
<EOS>
He
be
expect
to
arrive
in
the
capital
every
day
;
and
it
be
naturally
enough
predict
that
his
reception
in
society
there
could
not
fail
to
be
of
the
most
flattering
and
most
brilliant
kind
.
  
<EOS>
the
Welwyns
listen
to
this
story
with
some
little
interest
;
Rosamond
,
who
be
very
romantic
,
be
especially
attract
by
it
,
and
openly
avow
to
her
father
and
sister
,
when
they
get
back
to
their
hotel
<EOS>
,
that
she
feel
as
ardent
a
curiosity
as
anybody
to
see
the
adventurous
and
generous
baron
.
<EOS>
the
desire
be
soon
gratify
.
<EOS>
Franval
come
to
Paris
,
as
have
be
anticipate
 
be
introduce
to
the
Welwyns
 
meet
them
constantly
in
society
 
make
no
favorable
impression
on
Ida
,
but
win
the
good
opinion
of
Rosamond
from
the
first
;
and
be
regard
with
such
high
approval
by
their
father
,
that
when
he
mention
his
intention
of
visit
England
in
the
spring
of
the
new
year
,
he
be
cordially
invite
to
spend
the
hunting
season
at
Glenwith
Grange
.
  
<EOS>
I
come
back
from
Germany
about
the
same
time
that
the
Welwyns
return
from
Paris
,
and
at
once
set
myself
to
improve
my
neighborly
intimacy
with
the
family
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
fond
of
Ida
;
more
fond
,
perhaps
,
than
my
vanity
will
now
allow
me
to
;
but
that
be
of
no
consequence
.
<EOS>
It
be
much
more
to
the
purpose
to
tell
you
that
I
hear
the
whole
of
the
baron
's
story
enthusiastically
relate
by
Mr.
Welwyn
and
Rosamond
;
that
he
come
to
the
grange
at
the
appoint
time
;
that
I
be
introduce
to
him
;
and
that
he
produce
as
unfavorable
an
impression
upon
me
as
he
have
already
produce
upon
Ida
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
whimsical
enough
;
but
I
really
could
not
tell
why
I
dislike
him
,
though
I
could
account
very
easily
,
accord
to
my
own
notion
,
for
his
win
the
favor
and
approval
of
Rosamond
and
her
father
.
<EOS>
He
be
certainly
a
handsome
man
as
far
as
feature
go
;
he
have
a
win
gentleness
and
graceful
respect
in
his
manner
when
he
speak
to
woman
;
and
he
sing
remarkably
well
,
with
one
of
the
sweetest
tenor
voice
I
ever
hear
.
<EOS>
these
quality
alone
be
quite
sufficient
to
attract
any
girl
of
Rosamond
's
disposition
;
and
I
certainly
never
wonder
why
he
be
a
favorite
of
hers
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
as
to
her
father
,
the
baron
be
not
only
fit
to
win
his
sympathy
and
regard
in
the
field
,
by
prove
himself
an
ardent
sportsman
and
an
excellent
rider
;
but
be
also
,
in
virtue
of
some
of
his
minor
personal
peculiarity
,
just
the
man
to
gain
the
friendship
of
his
host
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Welwyn
be
as
ridiculously
prejudice
as
most
weak
-
head
englishman
be
,
on
the
subject
of
foreigner
in
general
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
his
visit
to
Paris
,
the
vulgar
notion
of
a
Frenchman
continue
to
be
his
notion
,
both
while
he
be
in
France
and
when
he
return
from
it
.
<EOS>
now
,
the
baron
be
as
unlike
the
traditional
"
Mounseer
"
of
english
song
,
play
,
and
satire
,
as
a
man
could
well
be
;
and
it
be
on
account
of
this
very
dissimilarity
that
Mr.
Welwyn
first
take
a
violent
fancy
to
him
,
and
then
invite
him
to
his
house
.
<EOS>
Franval
speak
English
remarkably
well
;
wear
neither
beard
,
mustache
,
nor
whisker
;
keep
his
hair
cut
almost
unbecomingly
short
;
dress
in
the
extreme
of
plainness
and
modest
good
taste
;
talk
 
little
in
general
society
;
utter
his
word
,
when
he
do
speak
,
with
singular
calmness
and
deliberation
;
and
,
to
crown
all
,
have
the
great
part
of
his
acquire
property
invest
in
english
security
.
<EOS>
in
Mr.
Welwyn
's
estimation
,
such
a
man
as
this
be
a
perfect
miracle
of
a
Frenchman
,
and
he
admire
and
encourage
him
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
say
that
I
dislike
him
,
yet
could
not
assign
a
reason
for
my
dislike
;
and
I
can
only
repeat
it
now
.
<EOS>
He
be
remarkably
polite
to
me
;
we
often
ride
together
in
hunting
,
and
sit
near
each
other
at
the
Grange
table
;
but
I
could
never
become
familiar
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
always
give
me
the
idea
of
a
man
who
have
some
mental
reservation
in
say
the
most
trifling
thing
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
constant
restraint
,
hardly
perceptible
to
most
people
,
but
plainly
visible
,
nevertheless
,
to
me
,
which
seem
to
accompany
his
light
word
,
and
to
hang
about
his
most
familiar
manner
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
no
just
reason
for
my
secretly
dislike
and
distrust
him
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
Ida
say
as
much
to
me
,
<EOS>
I
remember
,
when
I
confess
to
her
what
my
feeling
toward
him
be
,
and
try
(
but
vainly
)
to
induce
her
to
be
equally
candid
with
me
in
return
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
shrink
from
the
tacit
condemnation
of
Rosamond
's
opinion
which
such
a
confidence
on
her
part
would
have
imply
.
<EOS>
and
yet
she
watch
the
growth
of
that
opinion
 
or
,
in
other
word
,
the
growth
of
her
sister
's
like
for
the
baron
 
with
an
apprehension
and
sorrow
which
she
try
fruitlessly
to
conceal
.
<EOS>
even
her
father
begin
to
notice
that
her
spirit
be
not
so
good
as
usual
,
and
to
suspect
the
cause
of
her
melancholy
.
<EOS>
I
remember
he
jest
,
with
all
the
dense
insensibility
of
a
stupid
man
,
about
Ida
have
invariably
be
jealous
,
from
a
child
,
if
Rosamond
look
kindly
upon
anybody
except
her
eld
sister
.
  
<EOS>
the
spring
begin
to
get
far
advanced
toward
summer
.
<EOS>
Franval
pay
a
visit
to
London
;
come
back
in
the
middle
of
the
season
to
Glenwith
Grange
;
write
to
put
off
his
departure
for
France
;
and
at
last
(
not
at
all
to
the
surprise
of
anybody
who
be
intimate
with
the
Welwyns
)
propose
to
Rosamond
,
and
be
accept
.
<EOS>
He
be
candor
and
generosity
itself
when
the
preliminary
of
the
marriage
-
settlement
be
under
discussion
.
<EOS>
He
quite
overpower
Mr.
Welwyn
and
the
lawyer
with
reference
,
paper
,
and
statement
of
the
distribution
and
extent
of
his
property
,
which
be
find
to
be
perfectly
correct
.
<EOS>
His
sister
be
write
to
,
and
return
the
most
cordial
answer
;
say
that
the
state
of
their
health
would
not
allow
them
to
come
to
England
for
the
marriage
;
but
add
a
warm
invitation
to
Normandy
for
the
bride
and
her
family
.
<EOS>
nothing
,
in
short
,
could
be
more
straightforward
and
satisfactory
than
the
baron
's
behavior
,
and
the
testimony
to
his
worth
and
integrity
which
the
news
of
the
approach
marriage
produce
from
his
relative
and
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
joyless
face
at
the
Grange
now
be
Ida
's
.
<EOS>
at
any
time
it
would
have
be
a
hard
trial
to
her
to
resign
that
first
and
foremost
place
which
she
have
hold
since
childhood
in
her
sister
's
heart
,
as
she
know
she
must
resign
it
when
Rosamond
marry
.
<EOS>
but
,
secretly
dislike
and
distrust
Franval
as
she
do
,
the
thought
that
he
be
soon
to
become
the
husband
of
her
beloved
sister
fill
her
with
a
vague
sense
of
terror
which
she
could
not
explain
to
herself
;
which
it
be
imperatively
necessary
that
she
should
conceal
;
and
which
,
on
those
very
account
,
become
a
daily
and
hourly
torment
to
her
that
be
almost
more
than
she
could
bear
.
  
<EOS>
one
consolation
alone
support
her
:
<EOS>
rosamond
and
<EOS>
she
be
not
to
be
separate
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
the
baron
secretly
dislike
her
as
much
as
she
dislike
him
;
she
know
that
she
must
bid
farewell
to
the
bright
and
happy
part
of
her
life
on
the
day
when
she
go
to
live
under
the
same
roof
with
her
sister
's
husband
;
but
,
true
to
the
promise
make
year
and
year
ago
by
her
die
mother
's
bed
 
true
to
the
affection
which
be
the
ruling
and
beautiful
feeling
of
her
whole
existence
 
she
never
hesitate
about
indulge
Rosamond
's
wish
,
when
the
girl
,
in
her
bright
,
light
-
hearted
way
,
say
that
she
could
never
get
on
comfortably
in
the
marriage
state
unless
she
have
Ida
to
live
with
her
and
help
her
just
the
same
as
ever
.
<EOS>
the
baron
be
too
polite
a
man
even
to
look
dissatisfied
when
he
hear
of
the
propose
arrangement
;
and
it
be
therefore
settle
from
the
beginning
that
Ida
be
always
to
live
with
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
the
marriage
take
place
in
the
summer
,
and
the
bride
and
bridegroom
go
to
spend
their
honeymoon
in
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
on
their
return
to
Glenwith
Grange
,
a
visit
to
the
baron
's
sister
,
in
Normandy
,
be
talk
of
;
but
the
execution
of
this
project
be
suddenly
and
disastrously
suspend
by
the
death
of
Mr.
Welwyn
,
from
an
attack
of
pleurisy
.
  
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
calamity
,
the
project
journey
be
of
course
defer
;
and
when
autumn
and
the
shooting
season
come
,
the
baron
be
unwilling
to
leave
the
well
-
stock
preserve
of
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
He
seem
,
indeed
,
to
grow
less
and
less
inclined
,
as
time
advance
,
for
the
trip
to
Normandy
;
and
write
excuse
after
excuse
to
his
sister
,
when
letter
arrive
from
them
urge
him
to
pay
the
promise
visit
.
<EOS>
in
the
winter
-
time
,
he
say
he
would
not
allow
his
wife
to
risk
a
long
journey
.
<EOS>
in
the
spring
,
his
health
be
pronounce
to
be
delicate
.
<EOS>
in
the
genial
summer
-
time
,
the
accomplishment
of
the
propose
visit
would
be
impossible
,
for
at
that
period
the
baroness
expect
to
become
a
mother
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
apology
which
Franval
seem
almost
glad
to
be
able
to
send
to
his
sister
in
France
.
  
<EOS>
the
marriage
be
,
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
term
,
a
happy
one
.
<EOS>
the
baron
,
though
he
never
altogether
lose
the
strange
restraint
and
reserve
of
his
manner
,
be
,
in
his
quiet
,
peculiar
way
,
the
fond
and
kind
of
husband
.
<EOS>
He
go
to
town
occasionally
on
business
,
but
always
seem
glad
to
return
to
the
baroness
;
he
never
vary
in
the
politeness
of
his
bearing
toward
his
wife
's
sister
;
he
behave
with
the
most
courteous
hospitality
toward
all
the
friend
of
the
Welwyns
;
in
short
,
he
thoroughly
justify
the
good
opinion
which
Rosamond
and
her
father
have
form
of
him
when
they
first
meet
at
Paris
.
<EOS>
and
yet
no
experience
of
his
character
thoroughly
re
-
assure
Ida
.
<EOS>
month
pass
on
quietly
and
pleasantly
;
and
still
that
secret
sadness
,
that
indefinable
,
unreasonable
apprehension
on
Rosamond
's
account
,
hang
heavily
on
her
sister
's
heart
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
beginning
of
the
first
summer
month
,
a
little
domestic
inconvenience
happen
,
which
show
the
baroness
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
her
husband
's
temper
could
be
seriously
ruffle
 
and
that
by
the
veri
trifle
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
the
habit
of
take
in
two
french
provincial
newspaper
 
one
publish
at
Bordeaux
and
the
other
at
Havre
.
<EOS>
He
always
open
these
journal
the
moment
they
come
,
look
at
one
particular
column
of
each
with
the
deep
attention
,
for
a
few
minute
,
then
carelessly
throw
them
aside
into
his
waste
-
paper
basket
.
<EOS>
His
wife
and
her
sister
be
at
first
rather
surprised
at
the
manner
in
which
he
read
his
two
paper
;
but
they
think
no
more
of
it
when
he
explain
that
he
only
take
them
in
to
consult
them
about
french
commercial
intelligence
,
which
may
be
,
occasionally
,
of
importance
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
these
paper
be
publish
weekly
.
<EOS>
on
the
occasion
to
which
I
have
just
refer
,
the
Bordeaux
paper
come
on
the
proper
day
,
as
usual
;
but
the
Havre
paper
never
make
its
appearance
.
<EOS>
this
trifle
circumstance
seem
to
make
the
baron
seriously
uneasy
.
<EOS>
He
write
off
directly
to
the
country
post
-
office
and
to
the
newspaper
agent
in
London
.
<EOS>
His
wife
,
astonish
to
see
his
tranquillity
so
completely
overthrow
by
so
slight
a
cause
,
try
to
restore
his
good
humor
by
jest
with
him
about
the
miss
newspaper
.
<EOS>
He
reply
by
the
first
angry
and
unfeeling
word
that
she
have
hear
issue
from
his
lip
.
<EOS>
She
be
then
within
about
six
week
of
her
confinement
,
and
very
unfit
to
bear
harsh
answer
from
anybody
 
least
of
all
from
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
second
day
no
answer
come
.
<EOS>
on
the
afternoon
of
the
third
,
the
baron
ride
off
to
the
post
town
to
make
inquiry
.
<EOS>
about
an
hour
after
he
have
go
,
a
strange
gentleman
come
to
the
Grange
and
ask
to
see
the
baroness
.
<EOS>
on
be
inform
that
she
be
not
well
enough
to
receive
visitor
,
he
send
up
a
message
that
his
business
be
of
great
importance
and
that
he
would
wait
downstairs
for
a
second
answer
.
  
<EOS>
on
receive
this
message
,
Rosamond
turn
,
as
usual
,
to
her
eld
sister
for
advice
.
<EOS>
Ida
go
downstairs
immediately
to
see
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
what
I
be
now
about
to
tell
you
of
the
extraordinary
interview
which
take
place
between
them
,
and
of
the
shocking
event
that
follow
it
,
I
have
hear
from
Miss
Welwyn
's
own
lip
.
  
<EOS>
She
feel
unaccountably
nervous
when
she
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
the
stranger
bow
very
politely
,
and
ask
,
in
a
foreign
accent
,
if
she
be
the
Baroness
Franval
.
<EOS>
She
set
him
right
on
this
point
,
and
tell
him
she
attend
to
all
matter
of
business
for
the
baroness
;
add
that
,
if
his
errand
at
all
concern
her
sister
's
husband
,
the
baron
be
not
then
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
the
stranger
answer
that
he
be
aware
of
it
when
he
call
,
and
that
the
unpleasant
business
on
which
he
come
could
not
be
confide
to
the
baron
 
at
least
,
in
the
first
instance
.
  
<EOS>
She
ask
why
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
be
there
to
explain
;
and
express
himself
as
feel
greatly
relieved
at
have
to
open
his
business
to
her
,
because
she
would
,
doubtless
,
be
best
able
to
prepare
her
sister
for
the
bad
news
that
he
be
,
unfortunately
,
oblige
to
bring
.
<EOS>
the
sudden
faintness
which
overcome
her
,
as
he
speak
those
word
,
prevent
her
from
address
him
in
return
.
<EOS>
He
pour
out
some
water
for
her
from
a
bottle
which
happen
to
be
stand
on
the
table
,
and
ask
if
he
may
depend
on
her
fortitude
.
<EOS>
She
try
to
say
"
yes
"
;
but
the
violent
throbbing
of
her
heart
seem
to
choke
her
.
<EOS>
He
take
a
foreign
newspaper
from
his
pocket
,
say
that
he
be
a
secret
agent
of
the
french
police
 
that
the
paper
be
the
Havre
Journal
,
for
the
past
week
,
and
that
it
have
be
expressly
keep
from
reach
the
baron
,
as
usual
,
through
his
(
the
agent
's
)
interference
.
<EOS>
He
then
open
the
newspaper
,
and
beg
that
she
would
nerve
herself
sufficiently
(
for
her
sister
's
sake
)
to
read
certain
line
,
which
would
give
her
some
hint
of
the
business
that
bring
him
there
.
<EOS>
He
point
to
the
passage
as
he
speak
.
<EOS>
It
be
among
the
"
Shipping
Entries
,
"
and
be
thus
express
:
  
"
arrive
,
the
Berenice
,
from
San
Francisco
,
with
a
valuable
cargo
of
hide
.
<EOS>
She
bring
one
passenger
,
the
Baron
Franval
,
of
Chateau
Franval
,
in
Normandy
.
"

to
him

<EOS>
He
then
sit
down
,
and
refer
again
to
the
entry

every
word
he
utter
seem
to
burn
itself
in
forever

<EOS>
He

:
"
It

He

We

Miss

see
the

look
up
at
her
after
he
have
read
this
extract
from
the
police

book

to
ascertain
if

He
ask

with

She

with
the

in
his

province
to
recognize
him

as

his
likeness

the
Baron
Franval

<EOS>
"
there
be
more
particular
add
,
not
important
enough
for
extract
.
<EOS>
We
immediately
examine
the
suppose
impostor
;
for
,
if
he
be
Monbrun

we
know

trace

<EOS>
the
moment
this
astounding
discovery

make
,
I
start
to
lay
an
embargo
on
the
forthcoming
number
of
the
Havre
Journal
for
that
week

which
be
about

<EOS>
I
arrive
at

on
Saturday
(
the
morning
of
publication
)
,
in
time
to
execute
my
design
.
<EOS>
I
wait
there
long
enough
to
communicate
by
telegraph
with
my
superior
in
Paris
,
then
hasten
to
this
place
.
<EOS>
what
my
errand
here
be
,
you
may
"
  
He
may
have
go
on
speak
for
some
moment
longer
;
but
Miss
Welwyn
hear
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
Her
first
sensation
of
return
consciousness
be
the
feeling
that
water
be
be
sprinkle
on
her
face
.
<EOS>
then
she
see
that
all
the
window
in
the
room
have
be
set
wide
open
,
to
give
her
air
;
and
that
she
and
the
agent
be
still
alone
.
<EOS>
at
first
she
feel
bewilder
,
and
hardly
know
who
he
be
;
but
he
soon
recall
to
her
mind
the
horrible
reality
that
have
bring
him
there
,
by
apologize
for
not
have
summon
assistance
when
she
faint
.
<EOS>
He
say
it
be
of
the
last
importance
,
in
Franval
's
absence
,
that
no
one
in
the
house
should
imagine
that
anything
unusual
be
take
place
in
it
.
<EOS>
then
,
after
give
her
an
interval
of
a
minute
or
two
to
collect
what
little
strength
she
have
leave
,
he
add
that
he
would
not
increase
her
suffering
by
say
anything
more
,
just
then
,
on
the
shocking
subject
of
the
investigation
which
it
be
his
duty
to
make
 
that
he
would
leave
her
to
recover
herself
,
and
to
consider
what
be
the
good
course
to
be
take
with
the
baroness
in
the
present
terrible
emergency
 
and
that
he
would
privately
return
to
the
house
between
eight
and
nine
o'clock
that
evening
,
ready
to
act
as
Miss
Welwyn
wish
,
and
to
afford
her
and
her
sister
any
aid
and
protection
of
which
they
may
stand
in
need
.
<EOS>
with
these
word
he
bow
,
and
noiselessly
quit
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
for
the
first
few
awful
minute
after
she
be
leave
alone
,
Miss
Welwyn
sit
helpless
and
speechless
;
utterly
numb
in
heart
,
and
mind
,
and
body
 
then
a
sort
of
instinct
(
she
be
incapable
of
thinking
)
seem
to
urge
her
to
conceal
the
fearful
news
from
her
sister
as
long
as
possible
.
<EOS>
She
run
upstairs
to
Rosamond
's
sitting
-
room
,
and
call
through
the
door
(
for
she
dare
not
trust
herself
in
her
sister
's
presence
)
that
the
visitor
have
come
on
some
troublesome
business
from
their
 
late
father
's
lawyer
,
and
that
she
be
go
to
shut
herself
up
,
and
write
some
long
letter
in
connection
with
that
business
.
<EOS>
after
she
have
get
into
her
own
room
,
she
be
never
sensible
of
how
time
be
pass
 
never
conscious
of
any
feeling
within
her
,
except
a
baseless
,
helpless
hope
that
the
french
police
may
yet
be
prove
to
have
make
some
terrible
mistake
 
until
she
hear
a
violent
shower
of
rain
come
on
a
little
after
sunset
.
<EOS>
the
noise
of
the
rain
,
and
the
freshness
it
bring
with
it
in
the
air
,
seem
to
awaken
her
as
if
from
a
painful
and
a
fearful
sleep
.
<EOS>
the
power
of
reflection
return
to
her
;
her
heart
heave
and
bound
with
an
overwhelming
terror
,
as
the
thought
of
Rosamond
come
back
vividly
to
it
;
her
memory
recur
despairingly
to
the
long
-
past
day
of
her
mother
's
death
,
and
to
the
farewell
promise
she
have
make
by
her
mother
's
bedside
.
<EOS>
She
burst
into
an
hysterical
passion
of
weeping
that
seem
to
be
tear
her
to
piece
.
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
it
she
hear
the
clatter
of
a
horse
's
hoofs
in
the
courtyard
,
and
know
that
Rosamond
's
husband
have
come
back
.
  
<EOS>
dip
her
handkerchief
in
cold
water
,
and
pass
it
over
her
eye
as
she
leave
the
room
,
she
instantly
hasten
to
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
fortunately
the
daylight
be
fade
in
the
old
-
fashioned
chamber
that
Rosamond
occupy
.
<EOS>
before
they
could
say
two
word
to
each
other
,
Franval
be
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
seem
violently
irritated
;
say
that
he
have
wait
for
the
arrival
of
the
mail
 
that
the
miss
newspaper
have
not
come
by
it
 
that
he
have
get
wet
through
 
that
he
feel
a
shivering
fit
come
on
 
and
that
he
believe
he
have
catch
a
violent
cold
.
<EOS>
His
wife
anxiously
suggest
some
simple
remedy
.
<EOS>
He
roughly
interrupt
her
,
say
there
be
but
one
remedy
,
the
remedy
of
go
to
bed
;
and
so
leave
them
without
another
word
.
<EOS>
She
just
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eye
,
and
say
softly
to
her
sister
,
"
how
he
be
change
!
"
<EOS>
then
speak
no
more
.
<EOS>
They
sit
silent
for
half
an
hour
or
long
.
<EOS>
after
that
,
Rosamond
go
affectionately
and
forgivingly
to
see
how
her
husband
be
.
<EOS>
She
return
,
say
that
he
be
in
bed
,
and
in
a
deep
,
heavy
sleep
;
and
predict
hopefully
that
he
would
wake
up
quite
well
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
more
the
clock
stick
nine
;
and
Ida
hear
the
servant
's
step
ascend
the
stair
.
<EOS>
She
suspect
what
his
errand
be
,
and
go
out
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
Her
presentiment
have
not
deceive
her
;
the
police
agent
have
arrive
,
and
be
wait
for
her
downstair
.
  
<EOS>
He
ask
her
if
she
have
say
anything
to
her
sister
,
or
have
think
of
any
plan
of
action
,
the
moment
she
enter
the
room
;
and
,
on
receive
a
reply
in
the
negative
,
inquire
,
further
,
if
"
the
baron
"
have
come
home
yet
.
<EOS>
She
answer
that
he
have
;
that
he
be
ill
and
tired
,
and
vexed
,
and
that
he
have
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
the
agent
ask
in
an
eager
whisper
if
she
know
that
he
be
asleep
,
and
alone
in
bed
?
<EOS>
and
,
when
he
receive
her
reply
,
say
that
he
must
go
up
into
the
bedroom
directly
.
  
<EOS>
She
begin
to
feel
the
faintness
come
over
her
again
,
and
with
it
sensation
of
loathing
and
terror
that
she
could
neither
express
to
other
nor
define
to
herself
.
<EOS>
He
say
that
if
she
hesitate
to
let
him
avail
himself
of
this
unexpected
opportunity
,
her
scruple
may
lead
to
fatal
result
He
remind
her
that
if
"
the
baron
"
be
really
the
convict
Monbrun
,
the
claim
of
society
and
of
justice
demand
that
he
should
be
discover
by
the
first
available
mean
;
and
that
if
he
be
not
 
if
some
inconceivable
mistake
have
really
be
commit
 
then
such
a
plan
for
get
immediately
at
the
truth
as
be
now
propose
would
insure
the
delivery
of
an
innocent
man
from
suspicion
;
and
at
the
same
time
spare
him
the
knowledge
that
he
have
ever
be
suspect
.
<EOS>
this
last
argument
have
its
effect
on
Miss
Welwyn
.
<EOS>
the
baseless
,
helpless
hope
that
the
french
authority
may
yet
be

to
be
in
error
,
which
she
have
already
feel
in
her
own
room
,
return
to

<EOS>
She
suffer
the

.
  
<EOS>
He
take

softly
;
and

though

that
the
carriage
be
get
ready
quietly
and
quickly
.
<EOS>
Miss
Welwyn
go
upstairs
to
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
how
the
fearful
news
be
first
break
to
Rosamond
,
I
can
not
relate
to
you
.
<EOS>
Miss
Welwyn
have
never
confide
to
me
,
have
never
confide
to
anybody
,
what
happen
at
the
interview
between
her
sister
and
herself
that
night
.
<EOS>
I
can
tell
you
nothing
of
the
shock
they
both
suffer
,
except
that
the
young
and
the
weak
die
under
it
;
that
the
elder
and
the
strong
have
never
recover
from
it
,
and
never
will
.
  
<EOS>
They
go
away
the
same
night
,
with
one
attendant
,
to
Harleybrook
,
as
the
agent
have
advise
.
<EOS>
before
daybreak
Rosamond
be
seize
with
the
pain
of
premature
labor
.
<EOS>
She
die
three
day
after
,
unconscious
of
the
horror
of
her
situation
,
wander
in
her
mind
about
past
time
,
and
singe
old
tune
that
Ida
have
teach
her
as
she
lie
in
her
sister
's
arm
.
  
<EOS>
the
child
be
bear
alive
,
and
live
still
.
<EOS>
You
see
her
at
the
window
as
we
come
in
at
the
back
way
to
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
I
surprise
you
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
by
ask
you
not
to
speak
of
her
to
Miss
Welwyn
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
notice
something
vacant
in
the
little
girl
's
expression
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
say
that
her
mind
be
more
vacant
still
.
<EOS>
if
"
idiot
"
do
not
sound
like
a
mock
word
,
however
tenderly
and
pityingly
one
may
wish
to
utter
it
,
I
should
tell
you
that
the
poor
thing
have
be
an
idiot
from
her
birth
.
  
<EOS>
You
will
,
doubtless
,
want
to
hear
now
what
happen
at
Glenwith
Grange
after
Miss
Welwyn
and
her
sister
have
leave
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
the
letter
which
the
police
agent
send
the
next
morning
to
Harleybrook
;
and
,
speak
from
my
recollection
of
that
,
I
shall
be
able
to
relate
all
you
can
desire
to
know
.
  
<EOS>
first
,
as
to
the
past
history
of
the
scoundrel
Monbrun
,
I
 
nee
only
tell
you
that
he
be
identical
with
an
escape
convict
,
who
,
for
a
long
term
of
year
,
have
successfully
elude
the
vigilance
of
the
authority
all
over
Europe
,
and
in
America
as
well
.
<EOS>
in
conjunction
with
two
accomplice
,
he
have
succeed
in
possess
himself
of
large
sum
of
money
by
the
most
criminal
mean
.
<EOS>
He
also
act
secretly
as
the
"
banker
"
of
his
convict
brother
,
whose
dishonest
gain
be
all
confide
to
his
hand
for
safe
-
keeping
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
be
certainly
capture
,
on
venture
back
to
France
,
along
with
his
two
associate
,
but
for
the
dare
imposture
in
which
he
take
refuge
;
and
which
,
if
the
true
Baron
Franval
have
really
die
abroad
,
as
be
report
,
would
,
in
all
probability
,
never
have
be
find
out
.
  
<EOS>
besides
his
extraordinary
likeness
to
the
baron
,
he
have
every
other
requisite
for
carry
on
his
deception
successfully
.
<EOS>
though
his
parent
be
not
wealthy
,
he
have
receive
a
good
education
.
<EOS>
He
be
so
notorious
for
his
gentleman
-
like
manner
among
the
villainous
associate
of
his
crime
and
excess
,
that
they
nickname
him
"
the
Prince
.
<EOS>
"
all
his
early
life
have
be
pass
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
Chateau
Franval
.
<EOS>
He
know
what
be
the
circumstance
which
have
induce
the
baron
to
leave
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
in
the
country
to
which
the
baron
have
emigrate
.
<EOS>
He
be
able
to
refer
familiarly
to
person
and
locality
,
at
home
and
abroad
,
with
which
the
baron
be
sure
to
be
acquaint
.
<EOS>
and
,
lastly
,
he
have
an
expatriation
of
fifteen
year
to
plead
for
him
as
his
all
-
sufficient
excuse
,
if
he
make
any
slight
mistake
before
the
baron
's
sister
,
in
his
assume
character
of
their
long
-
absent
brother
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
,
of
course
,
hardly
necessary
for
me
to
tell
you
,
in
relation
to
this
part
of
the
subject
,
that
the
true
Franval
be
immediately
and
honorably
reinstate
in
the
family
right
of
which
the
impostor
have
succeed
for
a
time
in
deprive
him
.
  
<EOS>
accord
to
Monbrun
's
own
account
,
he
have
marry
poor
Rosamond
purely
for
love
;
and
the
probability
certainly
be
,
that
the
pretty
,
innocent
english
girl
have
really
strike
the
villain
's
fancy
for
the
time
;
and
that
the
easy
,
quiet
life
he
be
lead
at
the
Grange
please
him
,
by
contrast
with
his
perilous
and
vagabond
existence
of
former
day
.
<EOS>
what
may
have
happen
if
he
have
have
time
enough
to
grow
weary
of
his
ill
-
fate
wife
and
his
english
home
,
it
be
now
useless
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
what
really
do
happen
on
the
morning
when
he
awake
after
the
flight
of
Ida
and
her
sister
can
be
briefly
tell
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
his
eye
open
they
rest
on
the
police
agent
,
sit
quietly
by
the
bedside
,
with
a
load
pistol
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Monbrun
know
immediately
that
he
be
discover
;
but
he
never
for
an
instant
lose
the
self
-
possession
for
which
he
be
famous
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
wish
to
have
five
minute
allow
him
to
deliberate
quietly
in
bed
,
whether
he
should
resist
the
french
authority
on
english
ground
,
and
so
gain
time
by
oblige
the
one
Government
to
apply
specially
to
have
him
deliver
up
by
the
other
 
or
whether
he
should
accept
the
term
officially
offer
to
him
by
the
agent
,
if
he
quietly
allow
himself
to
be
capture
.
<EOS>
He
choose
the
latter
course
 
it
be
suspect
,
because
he
wish
to
communicate
personally
with
some
of
his
convict
associate
in
France
,
whose
fraudulent
gain
be
in
his
keeping
,
and
because
he
feel
boastfully
confident
of
be
able
to
escape
again
,
whenever
he
please
.
<EOS>
be
his
secret
motive
,
however
,
what
they
may
,
he
allow
the
agent
to
conduct
him
peaceably
from
the
Grange
;
first
write
a
farewell
letter
to
poor
Rosamond
,
full
of
heartless
french
sentiment
and
glib
sophistry
about
Fate
and
Society
.
<EOS>
His
own
fate
be
not
long
in
overtake
him
.
<EOS>
He
attempt
to
escape
again
,
as
it
have
be
expect
he
would
,
and
be
shoot
by
the
sentinel
on
duty
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
I
remember
hear
that
the
bullet
enter
his
head
and
kill
him
on
the
spot
.
  
<EOS>
My
story
be
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
ten
year
now
since
Rosamond
be
bury
in
the
churchyard
yonder
;
and
it
be
ten
year
also
since
Miss
Welwyn
return
to
be
the
lonely
inhabitant
of
Glenwith
Grange
.
<EOS>
She
now
live
but
in
the
remembrance
that
it
call
up
before
her
of
her
happy
existence
of
former
day
.
<EOS>
there
be
hardly
an
object
in
the
old
house
which
do
not
tenderly
and
solemnly
remind
her
of
the
mother
,
whose
last
wish
she
live
to
obey
;
of
the
sister
,
whose
happiness
be
once
her
dear
earthly
care
.
<EOS>
those
print
that
you
notice
on
the
library
wall
Rosamond
use
to
copy
in
the
past
time
,
when
her
pencil
be
often
guide
by
Ida
's
hand
.
<EOS>
those
music
-
book
that
you
be
look
over
,
she
and
her
mother
have
play
from
together
through
many
a
long
and
quiet
summer
's
evening
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
tie
now
to
bind
her
to
the
present
but
the
poor
child
whose
affliction
it
be
her
constant
effort
to
lighten
,
and
the
little
peasant
population
around
her
,
whose
humble
care
and
want
and
sorrow
she
be
always
ready
to
relieve
.
<EOS>
far
and
near
her
modest
charity
have
penetrate
among
us
;
and
far
and
near
she
be
heartily
beloved
and
bless
in
many
a
laborer
's
household
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
poor
man
's
hearth
,
not
in
this
village
only
,
but
for
mile
away
from
it
as
well
,
at
which
you
would
not
be
receive
with
the
welcome
give
to
an
old
friend
,
if
you
only
tell
the
cottager
that
you
know
the
Lady
of
Glenwith
Grange
!

PROLOGUE
to
the
FIFTH
STORY
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
piece
of
work
which
occupy
my
attention
after
take
leave
of
Mr.
Garthwaite
,
offer
the
strong
possible
contrast
to
the
task
which
have
last
engage
me
.
<EOS>
fresh
from
paint
a
bull
at
a
farmhouse
,
I
set
forth
to
copy
a
Holy
Family
,
by
Correggio
,
at
a
convent
of
nun
.
<EOS>
People
who
go
to
the
Royal
Academy
Exhibition
,
and
see
picture
by
famous
artist
,
paint
year
after
year
in
the
same
marked
style
which
first
make
them
celebrate
,
would
be
amazed
indeed
if
they
know
what
a
Jack
-
of
-
all
-
trade
a
poor
painter
must
become
before
he
can
gain
his
daily
bread
.
  
<EOS>
the
picture
by
Correggio
which
I
be
now
commission
to
copy
have
be
lend
to
the
nun
by
a
catholic
gentleman
of
fortune
,
who
prize
it
as
the
gem
of
his
collection
,
and
who
have
never
before
trust
it
out
of
his
own
hand
.
<EOS>
My
copy
,
when
complete
,
be
to
be
place
over
the
high
altar
of
the
convent
chapel
;
and
my
work
throughout
its
progress
be
to
be
pursue
entirely
in
the
parlor
of
the
nunnery
,
and
always
in
the
watchful
presence
of
one
or
other
of
the
inmate
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
on
such
condition
that
the
owner
of
the
Correggio
be
willing
to
trust
his
treasure
out
of
his
own
hand
,
and
to
suffer
it
to
be
copy
by
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
the
restriction
he
impose
,
which
I
think
sufficiently
absurd
,
and
perhaps
offensively
suspicious
as
well
,
be
communicate
to
me
politely
enough
before
I
be
allow
to
undertake
the
commission
.
<EOS>
unless
I
be
inclined
to
submit
to
precautionary
regulation
which
would
affect
any
other
artist
exactly
as
they
affect
me
,
I
be
tell
not
to
think
of
offer
to
make
the
copy
;
and
the
nun
would
then
address
themselves
to
some
other
person
in
my
profession
.
<EOS>
after
a
day
's
consideration
,
I
submit
to
the
restriction
,
by
my
wife
's
advice
,
and
save
the
nun
the
trouble
of
make
application
for
a
copier
of
Correggio
in
any
other
quarter
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
the
convent
be
charmingly
situate
in
a
quiet
little
valley
in
the
West
of
England
.
<EOS>
the
parlor
in
which
I
be
to
paint
be
a
large
,
well
-
light
apartment
;
and
the
village
inn
,
about
half
a
mile
off
,
afford
me
cheap
and
excellent
quarter
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
thus
far
,
therefore
,
there
be
nothing
to
complain
of
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
picture
,
which
be
the
next
object
of
interest
to
me
,
I
be
surprised
to
find
that
the
copying
of
it
would
be
by
no
means
<EOS>
so
difficult
a
task
as
I
have
anticipate
.
<EOS>
I
be
rather
of
a
revolutionary
spirit
in
matter
of
art
,
and
be
bold
enough
to
think
that
the
old
master
have
their
fault
as
well
as
their
beauty
.
<EOS>
I
can
give
my
opinion
,
therefore
,
on
the
Correggio
at
the
convent
independently
at
least
.
<EOS>
look
at
technically
,
the
picture
be
a
fine
speciman
of
coloring
and
execution
;
but
look
at
for
the
high
merit
of
delicacy
,
elevation
,
and
feel
for
the
subject
,
it
deserve
copying
as
little
as
the
most
commonplace
work
that
any
unlucky
modern
artist
ever
produce
.
<EOS>
the
face
of
the
Holy
Family
not
only
fail
to
display
the
right
purity
and
tenderness
of
expression
,
but
absolutely
fail
to
present
any
expression
at
all
.
<EOS>
It
be
flat
heresy
to
say
so
,
but
the
valuable
Correggio
be
nevertheless
emphatically
,
and
,
in
so
many
word
,
a
very
uninteresting
picture
.
  
<EOS>
so
much
for
the
convent
and
the
work
that
I
be
to
do
in
it
.
<EOS>
My
next
anxiety
be
to
see
how
the
restriction
impose
on
me
be
to
be
carry
out
.
<EOS>
the
first
day
,
the
Mother
Superior
herself
mount
guard
in
the
parlor
 
<EOS>
a
stern
,
silent
,
fanatical
-
looking
woman
,
who
seem
determined
to
awe
me
and
make
me
uncomfortable
,
and
who
succeed
thoroughly
in
the
execution
of
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
the
second
day
she
be
relieve
by
the
officiating
priest
of
the
convent
 
a
mild
,
melancholy
,
gentleman
-
like
man
,
with
whom
I
get
on
tolerably
well
.
<EOS>
the
third
day
,
I
have
for
overlook
the
portress
of
the
house
 
<EOS>
a
dirty
,
dismal
,
deaf
,
old
woman
,
who
do
nothing
but
knit
stocking
and
chew
orris
-
root
.
<EOS>
the
fourth
day
,
a
middle
-
aged
nun
,
whom
I
hear
address
as
Mother
Martha
,
occupy
the
post
of
guardian
to
the
precious
Correggio
;
and
with
her
the
number
of
my
overlooker
terminate
.
<EOS>
She
,
and
the
portress
,
and
the
priest
,
and
the
Mother
Superior
,
relieve
each
other
with
military
regularity
,
until
I
have
put
the
last
touch
to
my
copy
.
<EOS>
I
find
them
ready
for
me
every
morning
on
enter
the
parlor
,
and
I
leave
them
in
the
chair
of
observation
every
evening
on
quit
it
.
<EOS>
as
for
any
young
and
beautiful
nun
who
may
have
be
in
the
building
,
I
never
so
much
as
set
eye
on
the
end
of
their
veil
.
<EOS>
from
the
door
to
the
parlor
,
and
from
the
parlor
to
the
door
,
comprise
the
whole
of
my
experience
of
the
inside
of
the
convent
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
one
of
my
superintend
companion
with
whom
I
establish
anything
like
a
familiar
acquaintance
be
Mother
Martha
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
outward
attraction
to
recommend
her
;
but
she
be
simple
,
good
-
humored
,
ready
to
gossip
,
and
inquisitive
to
a
perfectly
incredible
degree
.
<EOS>
Her
whole
life
have
be
pass
in
the
nunnery
;
she
be
thoroughly
accustomed
to
her
seclusion
,
thoroughly
content
with
the
monotonous
round
of
her
occupation
;
not
at
all
anxious
to
see
the
world
for
herself
;
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
insatiably
curious
to
know
all
about
it
from
other
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
question
connected
with
myself
,
my
wife
,
my
child
,
my
friend
,
my
profession
,
my
income
,
my
travel
,
my
favorite
amusement
,
and
even
my
favorite
sin
,
which
a
woman
could
ask
a
man
,
that
Mother
Martha
do
not
,
in
the
small
and
softest
of
voice
,
ask
of
me
.
<EOS>
though
an
intelligent
,
well
-
inform
person
in
all
that
relate
to
her
own
special
vocation
,
she
be
a
perfect
child
in
everything
else
.
<EOS>
I
constantly
catch
myself
talk
to
her
,
just
as
I
should
have
talk
at
home
to
one
of
my
own
little
girl
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
no
one
will
think
that
,
in
express
myself
thus
,
I
be
write
disparagingly
of
the
poor
nun
.
<EOS>
on
two
account
,
I
shall
always
feel
compassionately
and
gratefully
toward
Mother
Martha
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
only
person
in
the
convent
who
seem
sincerely
anxious
to
make
her
presence
in
the
parlor
as
agreeable
to
me
as
possible
;
and
she
good
-
humoredly
tell
me
the
story
which
it
be
my
object
in
these
page
to
introduce
to
the
reader
.
<EOS>
in
both
way
I
be
deeply
indebted
to
her
;
and
I
hope
always
to
remember
the
obligation
.
  
<EOS>
the
circumstance
under
which
the
story
come
to
be
relate
to
me
may
be
tell
in
very
few
word
.
  
<EOS>
the
interior
of
a
convent
parlor
be
a
complete
novelty
to
me
,
I
look
around
with
some
interest
on
first
enter
my
painting
-
room
at
the
nunnery
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
little
in
it
to
excite
the
curiosity
of
any
one
.
<EOS>
the
floor
be
cover
with
common
matting
,
and
the
ceiling
with
plain
whitewash
.
<EOS>
the
furniture
be
of
the
simple
kind
;
a
low
chair
with
a
pray
-
desk
fix
to
the
back
,
and
a
finely
carve
oak
book
-
case
,
stud
all
over
with
brass
crosse
,
be
the
only
useful
object
that
I
could
discern
which
have
any
conventional
character
about
them
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
ornament
of
the
room
,
they
be
entirely
beyond
my
appreciation
.
<EOS>
I
could
feel
no
interest
in
the
colored
print
of
saint
,
with
gold
platter
at
the
back
of
their
head
,
that
hang
on
the
wall
;
and
I
could
see
nothing
particularly
impressive
in
the
two
plain
little
alabaster
pot
for
holy
water
,
fasten
,
one
near
the
door
,
the
other
over
the
chimney
-
piece
.
<EOS>
the
only
object
,
indeed
,
in
the
whole
room
which
in
the
slight
degree
attract
my
curiosity
be
an
old
worm
-
eat
wooden
cross
,
make
in
the
rude
manner
,
hang
by
itself
on
a
slip
of
wall
between
two
window
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
strangely
rough
and
misshapen
a
thing
to
exhibit
prominently
in
a
neat
roam
,
that
I
suspect
some
history
must
be
attach
to
it
,
and
resolve
to
speak
to
my
friend
the
nun
about
it
at
the
early
opportunity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
Martha
,
"
say
I
,
take
advantage
of
the
first
pause
in
the
succession
of
quaintly
innocent
question
which
she
be
as
usual
addressing
to
me
,
"
I
have
be
look
at
that
rough
old
cross
hang
between
the
window
,
and
fancy
that
it
must
surely
be
some
curiosity
"
  
"
Hush
!
hush
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
the
nun
,
"
you
must
not
speak
of
that
as
a
"
curiosity
'
;
the
Mother
Superior
call
it
a
Relic
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
say
I
;
"
I
ought
to
have
choose
my
expression
more
carefully
"
  
"
not
,
"
interpose
Mother
Martha
,
nod
to
show
me
that
my
apology
nee
not
be
finish
 
<EOS>
"
not
that
it
be
exactly
a
relic
in
the
strict
catholic
sense
of
the
word
;
but
there
be
circumstance
in
the
life
of
the
person
who
make
it
"
here
she
stop
,
and
look
at
me
doubtfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
circumstance
,
perhaps
,
which
it
be
not
consider
advisable
to
communicate
to
stranger
,
"
I
suggest
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
!
"
answer
the
nun
,
"
I
never
hear
that
they
be
to
be
keep
a
secret
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
tell
as
a
secret
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
know
all
about
them
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
.
<EOS>
I
could
tell
you
the
whole
history
of
the
wooden
cross
;
but
it
be
all
about
Catholics
,
and
you
be
a
Protestant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
,
Mother
Martha
,
do
not
make
it
at
all
less
interesting
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
it
not
,
indeed
?
"
exclaim
the
nun
,
innocently
.
<EOS>
"
what
a
strange
man
you
be
!
<EOS>
and
what
a
remarkable
religion
yours
must
be
!
<EOS>
what
do
your
priest
say
about
ours
?
<EOS>
be
they
learn
man
,
your
priest
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
feel
that
my
chance
of
hear
Mother
Martha
's
story
would
be
a
poor
one
indeed
,
if
I
allow
her
to
begin
a
fresh
string
of
question
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
I
dismiss
the
inquiry
about
the
clergy
of
the
Established
Church
with
the
most
irreverent
briefness
,
and
recall
her
attention
forthwith
to
the
subject
of
the
wooden
cross
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
"
say
the
good
-
natured
nun
;
"
surely
you
shall
hear
all
I
can
tell
you
about
it
;
but
"
she
hesitate
timidly
,
"
but
I
must
ask
the
Mother
Superior
's
leave
first
.
"
  
<EOS>
say
these
word
,
she
summon
the
portress
,
to
my
great
amusement
,
to
keep
guard
over
the
inestimable
Correggio
in
her
absence
,
and
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
in
less
than
five
minute
she
come
back
,
look
quite
happy
and
important
in
her
innocent
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
Mother
Superior
,
"
she
say
,
"
have
give
me
leave
to
tell
all
I
know
about
the
wooden
cross
.
<EOS>
She
say
it
may
do
you
good
,
and
improve
your
protestant
opinion
of
us
Catholics
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
express
myself
as
be
both
willing
and
anxious
to
profit
by
what
I
hear
;
and
the
nun
begin
her
narrative
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
She
relate
it
in
her
own
simple
,
earnest
,
minute
way
;
dwell
as
long
on
small
particular
as
on
important
incident
;
and
make
moral
reflection
for
my
benefit
at
every
place
where
it
be
possible
to
introduce
them
.
<EOS>
in
spite
,
however
,
of
these
drawback
in
the
telling
of
it
,
the
story
interested
and
impress
me
in
no
ordinary
degree
;
and
I
now
purpose
put
the
event
of
it
together
as
skillfully
and
strikingly
as
I
can
,
in
the
hope
that
this
write
version
of
the
narrative
may
appeal

strongly
to

<EOS>
the
NUN
's
STORY
  
of
  
<EOS>
GABRIEL
'S
<EOS>
MARRIAGE
  
.
  
<EOS>
one
night
,
during
the
period
of
the
first
French
Revolution
,
the
family
of
Francois
Sarzeau
,
a
fisherman
of
Brittany
,
be
all
wake
and
watch
at
a
late
hour
in
their
cottage
on
the
peninsula
of
Quiberon
.
<EOS>
Francois
have
go
out
in
his
boat
that
evening
,
 
as
usual
,
to
fish
.
<EOS>
shortly
after
his
departure
,
the
wind
have
rise
,
the
cloud
have
gather
;
and
the
storm
,
which
have
be
threaten
at
interval
throughout
the
whole
day
,
burst
forth
furiously
about
nine
o'clock
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
eleven
;
and
the
raging
of
the
wind
over
the
barren
,
heathy
peninsula
still
seem
to
increase
with
each
fresh
blast
that
tear
its
way
out
upon
the
open
sea
;
the
crashing
of
the
wave
on
the
beach
be
awful
to
hear
;
the
dreary
blackness
of
the
sky
terrible
to
behold
.
<EOS>
the
longer
they
listen
to
the
storm
,
the
oftener
they
look
out
at
it
,
the
fainter
grow
the
hope
which
the
fisherman
's
family
still
strove
to
cherish
for
the
safety
of
Francois
Sarzeau
and
of
his
young
son
who
have
go
with
him
in
the
boat
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
impressive
in
the
simplicity
of
the
scene
that
be
now
pass
within
the
cottage
.
  
<EOS>
on
one
side
of
the
great
,
rugged
,
black
fire
-
place
crouch
two
little
girl
;
the
young
half
asleep
,
with
her
head
in
her
sister
's
lap
.
<EOS>
these
be
the
daughter
of
the
fisherman
;
and
opposite
to
them
sit
their
eld
brother
,
Gabriel
.
<EOS>
His
right
arm
have
be
badly
wound
in
a
recent
encounter
at
the
national
game
of
the
Soule
,
a
sport
resemble
our
english
foot
-
ball
;
but
play
on
both
side
in
such
savage
earnest
by
the
people
of
Brittany
as
to
end
always
in
bloodshed
,
often
in
mutilation
,
sometimes
even
in
loss
of
life
.
<EOS>
on
the
same
bench
with
Gabriel
sit
his
betroth
wife
 
a
girl
of
eighteen
 
clothe
in
the
plain
,
almost
monastic
black
-
and
-
white
costume
of
her
native
district
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
daughter
of
a
small
farmer
live
at
some
little
distance
from
the
coast
.
<EOS>
between
the
group
form
on
either
side
of
the
fire
-
place
,
the
vacant
space
be
occupy
by
the
foot
of
a
truckle
-
bed
.
<EOS>
in
this
bed
lie
a
very
old
man
,
the
father
of
Francois
Sarzeau
.
<EOS>
His
haggard
face
be
cover
with
deep
wrinkle
;
his
long
white
hair
flow
over
the
coarse
lump
of
sack
which
serve
him
for
a
pillow
,
and
his
light
gray
eye
wander
incessantly
,
with
a
strange
expression
of
terror
and
suspicion
,
from
person
to
person
,
and
from
object
to
object
,
in
all
part
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
whenever
the
wind
and
sea
whistle
and
roar
at
their
loud
,
he
mutter
to
himself
and
toss
his
hand
fretfully
on
his
wretched
coverlet
.
<EOS>
on
these
occasion
his
eye
always
fix
themselves
intently
on
a
little
delf
image
of
the
Virgin
place
in
a
niche
over
the
fire
-
place
.
<EOS>
every
time
they
see
him
look
in
this
direction
Gabriel
and
the
young
girl
shudder
and
cross
themselves
;
and
even
the
child
,
who
still
keep
awake
,
imitate
their
example
.
<EOS>
there
be
one
bond
of
feeling
at
least
between
the
old
man
and
his
grandchild
,
which
connect
his
age
and
their
youth
unnaturally
and
closely
together
.
<EOS>
this
feeling
be
reverence
for
the
superstition
which
have
be
hand
down
to
them
by
their
ancestor
from
century
and
century
back
,
as
far
even
as
the
age
of
the
Druids
.
<EOS>
the
spirit
warning
of
disaster
and
death
which
the
old
man
hear
in
the
wailing
of
the
wind
,
in
the
crashing
of
the
wave
,
in
the
dreary
,
monotonous
rattling
of
the
casement
,
the
young
man
and
his
affiance
wife
and
the
little
child
who
cower
by
the
fireside
hear
too
.
<EOS>
all
difference
in
sex
,
in
temperament
,
in
year
,
superstition
be
strong
enough
to
strike
down
to
its
own
dread
level
,
in
the
fisherman
's
cottage
,
on
that
stormy
night
.
  
<EOS>
besides
the
bench
by
the
fireside
and
the
bed
,
the
only
piece
of
furniture
in
the
room
be
a
coarse
wooden
table
,
with
a
loaf
of
black
bread
,
a
knife
,
and
a
pitcher
of
cider
place
on
it
.
<EOS>
old
net
,
coil
of
rope
,
tattered
sail
,
hung
,
about
the
wall
and
over
the
wooden
partition
which
separate
the
room
into
two
compartment
.
<EOS>
wisps
of
straw
and
ear
of
barley
droop
down
through
the
rotten
rafter
and
gape
board
that
make
the
floor
of
the
granary
above
.
  
<EOS>
these
different
object
,
and
the
person
in
the
cottage
,
who
compose
the
only
survive
member
of
the
fisherman
's
family
,
be
strangely
and
wildly
light
up
by
the
blaze
of
the
fire
and
by
the
still
bright
glare
of
a
resin
torch
stick
into
a
block
of
wood
in
the
chimney
-
corner
.
<EOS>
the
red
and
yellow
light
play
full
on
the
weird
face
of
the
old
man
as
he
lie
opposite
to
it
,
and
glance
fitfully
on
the
figure
of
the
young
girl
,
Gabriel
,
and
the
two
child
;
the
great
,
gloomy
shadow
rise
and
fall
,
and
grow
and
lessen
in
bulk
about
the
wall
like
vision
of
darkness
,
animate
by
a
supernatural
specter
-
life
,
while
the
dense
obscurity
outside
spread
before
the
curtainless
window
seem
as
a
wall
of
solid
darkness
that
have
close
in
forever
around
the
fisherman
's
house
.
<EOS>
the
night
scene
within
the
cottage
be
almost
as
wild
and
as
dreary
to
look
upon
as
the
night
scene
without
.
  
<EOS>
for
a
long
time
the
different
person
in
the
room
sit
together
without
speak
,
even
without
look
at
each
other
.
<EOS>
at
last
the
girl
turn
and
whisper
something
into
Gabriel
's
ear
:
  
<EOS>
"
Perrine
,
what
be
you
say
to
Gabriel
?
"
<EOS>
ask
the
child
opposite
,
seize
the
first
opportunity
of
break
the
desolate
silence
 
doubly
desolate
at
her
age
 
which
be
preserve
by
all
around
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
tell
him
,
"
answer
Perrine
,
simply
,
"
that
it
be
time
to
change
the
bandage
on
his
arm
;
and
I
also
say
to
him
,
what
I
have
often
say
before
,
that
he
must
never
play
at
that
terrible
game
of
the
Soule
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
old
man
have
be
look
intently
at
Perrine
and
his
grandchild
as
they
speak
.
<EOS>
His
harsh
,
hollow
voice
mingle
with
the
last
soft
tone
of
the
young
girl
,
repeat
over
and
over
again
the
same
terrible
word
,
"
drown
!
<EOS>
drown
!
<EOS>
Son
and
grandson
,
both
drown
!
<EOS>
both
drown
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
hush
,
grandfather
,
"
say
Gabriel
,
"
we
must
not
lose
all
hope
for
them
yet
.
<EOS>
God
and
the
Blessed
Virgin
protect
them
!
"
<EOS>
He
look
at
the
little
delf
image
,
and
cross
himself
;
the
other
imitate
him
,
except
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
He
still
toss
his
hand
over
the
coverlet
,
and
still
repeat
,
"
drown
!
<EOS>
drown
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
that
accurse
Soule
!
<EOS>
"
groan
the
young
man
.
"
<EOS>
but
for
this
wound
I
should
have
be
with
my
father
.
<EOS>
the
poor
boy
's
life
may
at
least
have
be
save
;
for
we
should
then
have
leave
him
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
silence
!
"
exclaim
the
harsh
voice
from
the
bed
.
<EOS>
"
the
wail
of
die
man
rise
louder
than
the
loud
sea
;
the
devil
's
psalm
-
singe
roar
high
than
the
roar
wind

<EOS>
be
silent

<EOS>
Francois
drown

"
  
<EOS>
a
terrific
blast
of
wind
burst
over
the
house
as
he
speak
,
shake
it
to
its
center
,
overpower

a
gentleman
,
though
he
be
but
poorly
dress
.
<EOS>
He
come
up
,
and
tell
us
he
be
dead
tired
,
and
do
not
think
he
could
reach
the
town
that
night
and
ask
if
we
would
give
him
shelter
till
morning
.
<EOS>
and
your
father
say
yes
,
if
he
would
make
no
noise
,
because
the
wife
be
ill
,
and
the
child
be
asleep
.
<EOS>
so
he
say
all
he
want
be
to
go
to
sleep
himself
before
the
fire
.
<EOS>
We
have
nothing
to
give
him
but
black
bread
.
<EOS>
He
have
well
food
with
him
than
that
,
and
undo
his
knapsack
to
get
at
it
,
and
 
and
 
Gabriel
!
<EOS>
I
be
sink
 
drink
!
<EOS>
something
to
drink
 
<EOS>
I
be
parch
with
thirst
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
silent
and
deadly
pale
,
Gabriel
pour
some
of
the
cider
from
the
pitcher
on
the
table
into
a
drinking
-
cup
,
and
give
it
to
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
slight
as
the
stimulant
be
,
its
effect
on
him
be
almost
instantaneous
.
<EOS>
His
dull
eye
brighten
a
little
,
and
he
go
on
in
the
same
whispering
tone
as
before
:
  
"
He
pull
the
food
out
of
his
knapsack
rather
in
a
hurry
,
so
that
some
of
the
other
small
thing
in
it
fall
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
among
these
be
a
pocketbook
,
which
your
father
pick
up
and
give
him
back
;
and
he
put
it
in
his
coat
-
pocket
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
tear
in
one
of
the
side
of
the
book
,
and
through
the
hole
some
bank
-
note
bulge
out
.
<EOS>
I
see
them
,
and
so
do
your
father
<EOS>
(
do
not
move
away
,
Gabriel
;
keep
close
,
there
be
nothing
in
me
to
shrink
from
)
.
<EOS>
well
,
he
share
his
food
,
like
an
honest
fellow
,
with
us
;
and
then
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
and
give
me
four
or
five
livre
,
and
then
lie
down
before
the
fire
to
go
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
as
he
shut
his
eye
,
your
father
look
at
me
in
a
way
I
do
not
like
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
behave
very
bitterly
and
desperately
toward
us
for
some
time
past
,
be
sour
about
poverty
,
and
your
mother
's
illness
,
and
the
constant
crying
out
of
you
child
for
more
to
eat
.
<EOS>
so
when
he
tell
me
to
go
and
buy
some
wood
,
some
bread
,
and
some
wine
with
money
I
have
get
,
I
do
not
like
,
somehow
,
to
leave
him
alone
with
the
stranger
;
and
so
make
excuse
,
say
(
which
be
true
)
that
it
be
too
late
to
buy
thing
in
the
village
that
night
.
<EOS>
but
he
tell
me
in
a
rage
to
go
and
do
as
he
bid
me
,
and
knock
the
people
up
if
the
shop
be
shut
.
<EOS>
so
I
go
out
,
be
dreadfully
afraid
of
your
father
 
<EOS>
as
indeed
we
all
be
at
that
time
 
<EOS>
but
I
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
go
far
from
the
house
;
I
be
afraid
of
something
happen
,
though
I
do
not
dare
to
think
what
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
it
be
,
but
I
steal
back
in
about
ten
minute
on
tiptoe
to
the
cottage
;
I
look
in
at
the
window
,
and
see
 
o
God
!
<EOS>
forgive
him
!
<EOS>
o
God
!
forgive
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
 
<EOS>
I
 
more
to
drink
,
Gabriel
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
speak
again
 
more
to
drink
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
voice
in
the
next
room
have
cease
;
but
in
the
minute
of
silence
which
now
ensue
,
Gabriel
hear
his
sister
kiss
Perrine
,
and
wish
her
good
-
night
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
three
try
to
go
asleep
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gabriel
,
pray
yourself
,
and
teach
your
child
after
you
to
pray
,
that
your
father
may
find
forgiveness
where
he
be
now
go
.
<EOS>
I
see
him
as
plainly
as
I
now
see
you
,
kneel
with
his
knife
in
one
hand
over
the
sleep
man
.
<EOS>
He
be
take
the
little
book
with
the
note
in
it
out
of
the
stranger
's
pocket
.
<EOS>
He
get
the
book
into
his
possession
,
and
hold
it
quite
still
in
his
hand
for
an
instant
,
think
.
<EOS>
I
believe
 
<EOS>
oh
no
!
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
I
be
sure
 
he
be
repent
;
I
be
sure
he
be
go
to
put
the
book
back
;
but
just
at
that
moment
the
stranger
move
,
and
raise
one
of
his
arm
,
as
if
he
be
wake
up
.
<EOS>
then
the
temptation
of
the
devil
grow
too
strong
for
your
father
 
<EOS>
I
see
him
lift
the
hand
with
the
knife
in
it
 
but
see
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
look
in
at
the
window
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
move
away
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
cry
out
;
I
stand
with
my
back
turn
toward
the
house
,
shiver
all
over
,
though
it
be
a
warm
summer
-
time
,
and
hear
no
cry
,
no
noise
at
all
,
from
the
room
behind
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
too
frightened
to
know
how
long
it
be
before
the
opening
of
the
cottage
door
<EOS>
make
me
turn
round
;
but
when
I
do
,
I
see
your
father
stand
before
me
in
the
yellow
moonlight
,
carry
in
his
arm
the
bleed
body
of
the
poor
lad
who
have
share
his
food
with
us
and
sleep
on
our
hearth
.
<EOS>
Hush
!
<EOS>
hush
!
<EOS>
do
not
groan
and
sob
in
that
way
!
<EOS>
stifle
it
with
the
bedclothe

<EOS>
Hush

<EOS>
you
will
wake
them
in

exclaim
a
voice
from
behind
the
partition

<EOS>
"
what

<EOS>
Gabriel

<EOS>
let
me
come
out
and
be
with
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
no

"
cry
the
old
man
,
collect
the
last
remain
of
his
strength
in
the
attempt
to
speak
above
the
wind
,
which
be
just
then
howl
at
the
loud
;
"
stay
where
you
be
 
do
not
speak
,
do
not
come
out
 
<EOS>
I
command
you
!

Gabriel
"
<EOS>
(
his
voice
drop
to
a
faint
whisper
)
,
"
raise
me
up
in
bed
 
<EOS>
you
must
hear
the
whole
of
it
now
;
raise
me
;
I
be
choke
so
that
I
can
hardly
speak
.
<EOS>
keep
close
and
listen
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
much
more
.
<EOS>
where

<EOS>
ah

your
father
!
<EOS>
He
threaten
to
kill
me
if
I
do
not
swear
to
keep
it
secret
;
and
in
terror
of
my
life
I
swear
.
<EOS>
He
make
me
help
him
to
carry
the
body
 
<EOS>
we
take
it
all
across
the
heath
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
horrible
,
horrible
,
under
the
bright
moon
(
lift
me
higher
,
Gabriel
)
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
great
stone
yonder
,
set
up
by
the
heathen
;
you
know
the
hollow
place
under
the
stone
they
call
"
the
Merchant
's
Table
'
;
we
have
plenty
of
room
to
lay
him
in
that
,
and
hide
him
so
;
and
then
we
run
back
to
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
I
never
dare
to
go
near
the
place
afterward
;
no
,
nor
your
father
either
!
<EOS>
(
high
,
Gabriel

<EOS>
I
be
choke
again

<EOS>
We
burn
the
pocket

book
and
the
knapsack
 
never

his
name
 
<EOS>
we
keep
the
money
to
spend

<EOS>
(
You
be
not

me
;
you
be
not

close
enough

<EOS>
Your
father
say
it
be
a
legacy
,
when
you
and
your
mother
ask
about
the
money
.
<EOS>
(
You

me
,
you
shake
me
to
piece

Gabriel

when
you
sob
like
that

<EOS>
It

a
curse
on

the
curse
have
drown
your

the
curse

I
have
confess

if
your
father
be
alive

he
would
murder
me
;
but
tell
the
priest
 
because
of
my
guilty
soul
 
to
pray
,
and
 
remember
the
merchant
's
table
 
to
bury
,
and
to
pray
 
to
pray
always
for
"
  
as
long
as
Perrine
hear
faintly
the
whispering
of
the
old
man
,
though
no
word
that
he
say
reach
her
ear
,
she
shrink
from
open
the
door
in
the
partition
.
<EOS>
but
,
when
the
whispering
sound
,
which
terrify
her
she
know
not
how
or
why
,
first
falter
,
then
cease
altogether
;
when
she
hear
the
sobs
that
follow
them
;
and
when
her
heart
tell
her
who
be
weep
in
the
next
room
 
then
,
she
begin
to
be
influence
by
a
new
feeling
which
be
strong
than
the
strong
fear
,
and
she
open
the
door
without
hesitation
,
almost
without
tremble
.
  
<EOS>
the
coverlet
be
draw
up
over
the
old
man
;
Gabriel
be
kneel
by
the
bedside
,
with
his
face
hide
.
<EOS>
when
she
speak
to
him
,
he
neither
answer
nor
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
after
a
while
the
sobs
that
shake
him
cease
;
but
still
he
never
move
,
except
once
when
she
touch
him
,
and
then
he
shudder
 
shudder
under
her
hand
!
<EOS>
She
call
in
his
little
sister
,
and
they
speak
to
him
,
and
still
he
utter
no
word
in
reply
.
<EOS>
They
weep
.
<EOS>
one
by
one
,
often
and
often
,
they
entreat
him
with
loving
word
;
but
the
stupor
of
grief
which
hold
him
speechless
and
motionless
be
beyond
the
power
of
human
tear
,
strong
even
than
the
strength
of
human
love
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
near
daybreak
,
and
the
storm
be
lull
,
but
still
no
change
occur
at
the
bedside
.
<EOS>
once
or
twice
,
as
Perrine
knelt
near
Gabriel
,
still
vainly
endeavor
to
arouse
him
to
a
sense
of
her
presence
,
she
think
she
hear
the
old
man
breathe
feebly
,
and
stretch
out
her
hand
toward
the
coverlet
;
but
she
could
not
summon
courage
to
touch
him
or
to
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
first
time
she
have
ever
be
present
at
a
death
-
bed
;
the
stillness
in
the
room
,
the
stupor
of
despair
that
have
seize
on
Gabriel
,
so
horrify
her
,
that
she
be
almost
as
helpless
as
the
two
child
by
her
side
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
the
dawn
look
in
at
the
cottage
window
 
so
coldly
,
so
drearily
,
and
<EOS>
yet
so
re
-
assuringly
 
that
she
begin
to
recover
her
self
-
possession
at
all
.
<EOS>
then
she
know
that
her
good
resource
would
be
to
summon
assistance
immediately
from
the
near
house
.
<EOS>
while
she
be
try
to
persuade
the
two
child
to
remain
alone
in
the
cottage
with
Gabriel
during
her
temporary
absence
,
she
be
startle
by
the
sound
of
footstep
outside
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
open
,
and
a
man
appear
on
the
threshold
,
stand
still
there
for
a
moment
in
the
dim
,
uncertain
light
.
  
<EOS>
She
look
closer
 
look
intently
at
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
Francois
Sarzeau
himself
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
the
fisherman
be
drip
with
wet
;
but
his
face
,
always
pale
and
inflexible
,
seem
to
be
but
little
alter
in
expression
by
the
peril
through
which
he
must
have
pass
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
young
Pierre
lie
almost
insensible
in
his
arm
.
<EOS>
in
the
astonishment
and
fright
of
the
first
moment
,
Perrine
scream
as
she
recognize
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
,
there
,
there
!
"
he
say
,
peevishly
,
advance
straight
to
the
hearth
with
his
burden
;
"
do
not
make
a
noise
.
<EOS>
You
never
expect
to
see
us
alive
again
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
We
give
ourselves
up
as
lose
,
and
only
escape
after
all
by
a
miracle
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
lay
the
boy
down
where
he
could
get
the
full
warmth
of
the
fire
;
and
then
,
turn
round
,
take
a
wicker
-
cover
bottle
from
his
pocket
,
and
say
,
"
if
it
have
not
be
for
the
brandy
"
He
stop
suddenly
 
start
 
put
down
the
bottle
on
the
bench
near
him
 
and
advance
quickly
to
the
bedside
.
  
<EOS>
Perrine
look
after
him
as
he
go
;
and
see
Gabriel
,
who
have
rise
when
the
door
be
open
,
move
back
from
the
bed
as
Francois
approach
.
<EOS>
the
young
man

face
seem
to
have
be
suddenly
strike
to
stone
 
<EOS>
its
blank
,
ghastly
whiteness
be
awful
to
look
at
.
<EOS>
He
move
slowly
backward
and
backward
till
he
come
to
the
cottage
wall
 
then
stand
quite
still
,
stare
on
his
father
with
wild
,
vacant
eye
,
move
his
hand
to
and
fro
before
him
,
mutter
,
but
never
pronounce
one
audible
word
.
  
<EOS>
Francois
do
not
appear
to
notice
his
son
;
he
have
the
coverlet
of
the
bed
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
anything
the
matter
here
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
as
he
draw
it
down
.
  
<EOS>
still
Gabriel
could
not
speak
.
<EOS>
Perrine
see
it
,
and
answer
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gabriel
be
afraid
that
his
poor
grandfather

she
whisper
,
nervously

<EOS>
there

<EOS>
be

<EOS>
He

"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
very
restless
,
and
speak
of
the
ghostly
warning
that
we
all
know
of
;
he
say
he
see
and
hear
many
thing
which
tell
him
from
the
other

<EOS>
look
at

<EOS>
Your

<EOS>
at
this
moment

Francois

to
look
closely
at
him
.
<EOS>
a
faint
spasm
have
indeed
pass
over
the
deathly
face
;
the
lip
quiver
,
the
jaw
drop
.
<EOS>
Francois
shudder
as
he
look
,
and
move
away
hastily
from
the
bed
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
instant
Gabriel
start
from
the
wall
;
his
expression
alter
,
his
pale
cheek
flush
suddenly
,
as
he
snatch
up
the
wicker
-
case
bottle
,
and
pour
all
the
little
brandy
that
be
leave
in
it
down
his
grandfather
's
throat
.
  
<EOS>
the
effect
be
nearly
instantaneous
;
the
sink
vital
force
rally
desperately
.
<EOS>
the
old
man
's
eye
open
again
,
wander
round
the
room
,
then
fix
themselves
intently
on
Francois
as
he
stand
near
the
fire
.
<EOS>
try
and
terrible
as
his
position
be
at
that
moment
,
Gabriel
still
retain
self
-
possession
enough
to
whisper
a
few
word
in
Perrine
's
ear
.
"
<EOS>
go
back
again
into
the
bedroom
,
and
take
the
child
with
you
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
We
may
have
something
to
speak
about
which
you
have
well
not
hear

<EOS>
"
  
"
Son
Gabriel
,
your
grandfather
be
tremble
all
over

say
Francois
.
<EOS>
"
if
he
be

at
all
,

die
of
cold

help
me
to
lift
him
,

and
all
,
to
the
hearth

"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
!
<EOS>
do
not
let
him
touch
me

"
<EOS>
gasp
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
let
him
look
at
me
in
that
way
!
<EOS>
do
not
let
him
come
near
me
,
Gabriel
!
<EOS>
be
it
his
ghost
?
<EOS>
or
be
it
himself
?
"
  
<EOS>
as
Gabriel
answer
he
hear
a
knocking
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
His
father
open
it
,
and
disclose
to
view
some
people
from
the
neighbor
fishing
village
,
who
have
come
 
more
out
of
curiosity
than
sympathy
 
to
inquire
whether
Francois
and
the
boy
Pierre
have
survive
the
night
.
<EOS>
without
ask
any
one
to
enter
,
the
fisherman
surlily
and
shortly
answer
the
various
question
address
to
him
,
stand
in
his
own
doorway
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
thus
engage
,
Gabriel
hear
his
grandfather
mutter
vacantly
to
himself
,
"
last
night
 
how
about

grandson

<EOS>
what
be
I
talk
about
last
night

do
I
say
your
father

<EOS>
very
foolish
to
say
he
be
drown
,
and
then
see
him
come
back
alive
again
!
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
that
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
weak
in
my
head
,
I
can
not
remember
.
<EOS>
what
be
it
,
Gabriel
?
<EOS>
something
too
horrible
to
speak
of
?
<EOS>
be
that
what
you
be
whisper
and
tremble
about
?
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
horrible
.
<EOS>
a
crime
!
<EOS>
bloodshed
!
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
of
any
crime
or
bloodshe
here
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
be
frighten
out
of
my
wit
to
talk
in
that
way

<EOS>
only
a
big
heap
of
old
stone

what
with
the
storm

think
I
be
go
to
die
,
and
be
afraid
about
your
father

I
must
have
be
light

<EOS>
do
not
give
another
thought
to
that
nonsense

Gabriel

I
be
well
now

<EOS>
We
shall
all
live
to
laugh
at
poor
grandfather
for
talk
nonsense
about

so

He
stop
suddenly
.
<EOS>
a
low
cry
,
partly
of
terror
and
partly
of
pain
,
escape
him
;
the
look
of
pine
anxiety
and
imbecile
cunning
which
have
distort
his
face
while
he
have
be
speak
,
fade
from
it
forever

<EOS>
He
shiver
a
little
,
breathe
heavily
once
or
twice
,
then
become
quite
still
.
  
<EOS>
have
he
die
with
a
falsehood
on
his
lip

<EOS>
Gabriel
look
round
and
see
that
the
cottage
door
be
closed
,
and
that
his
father
be
stand
against
it
.
<EOS>
how
long
he
have
occupy
that
position
,
how
many
of
the
old
man
's
last
word
he
have
hear
,
it
be
impossible
to
conjecture
,
but
there
be
a
lower
suspicion
in
his
harsh
face
as
he
now
look
away
from
the
corpse
to
his
son
,
which
make
Gabriel
shudder
;
and
the
first
question
that
he
ask
,
on
once
more
approach
the
bedside
,
be
express
in
tone
which
,
quiet
as
they
be
,
have
a
fearful
meaning
in
them

<EOS>
"
what
do
your
grandfather
talk
about
last
night

"
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
do
not
answer

<EOS>
all
that
he
have
hear

all
that
he
have
see
,
all
the
misery
and
horror
that
may
yet
be
to
come
,
have
stun
his
mind
.
<EOS>
the
unspeakable
danger
of
his
present
position
be
too
tremendous
to
be
realize
.
<EOS>
He
could
only
feel
them
vaguely
in
the
weary
torpor
that
oppress
his
heart
;
while
in
every
other
direction
the
use
of
his
faculty
,
physical
and
mental
,
seem
to
have
suddenly
and
totally
abandon
him

<EOS>
"

on

bitter
laugh

Would
you
rather
I

He
can
not

why

not
you
tell
me
what
nonsense

You

I

"
<EOS>
(
He
cross
the
room
and
put
his
back
to
the
door
.
)
<EOS>
"
before
either
of
us
leave
this
place

you
shall
confess
it
!
<EOS>
You
know
that
my
duty
to
the
Church
bid
me
to
go
at
once
and
tell
the
priest
of
your
grandfather
's
death

repeat
it
to
the
day
of
your
death

I
ask
again
 
what
do
your
grandfather
say
to
you
when
he
be
wander
in
his
mind
last
night

"
He
speak
of
a
crime
commit
by
another
,
and
guiltily
keep
secret
by
him

answer
Gabriel
,
slowly
and
sternly
.
"
<EOS>
and
this
morning
he
deny
his
own
word
with
his
last
living
breath
.
<EOS>
but
last
night
,
if
he
speak
the
truth
"
  
"
the
truth
!
"
echo
Francois

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
truth
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
stop
,
his
eye
fall
,
then
turn
toward
the
corpse
.
<EOS>
for
a
few
minute
he
stand
steadily
contemplate
it
;
breathe
quickly
,
and
draw
his
hand
several
time
across
his
forehead
.
<EOS>
then
he
face
his
son
once
more
.
<EOS>
in
that
short
interval
he
have
become
in
outward
appearance
a
change
man
;
expression
,
voice
,
and
manner
,
all
be
alter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Heaven
forgive
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
go
on
,
"
but
I
could
almost
laugh
at
myself
,
at
this
solemn
moment
,
for
have
speak
and
act
just
now
so
much
like
a
fool
!
<EOS>
deny
his
word
,
do
he
?
<EOS>
poor
old
man
!
<EOS>
they
say
sense
often
come
back
to
light
-
head
people
just
before
death
;
and
he
be
a
proof
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
Gabriel
,
my
own
wit
must
have
be
a
little
shaken
 
and
no
wonder
 
by
what
I
go
through
last
night
,
and
what
I
have
come
home
to
this
morning
.
<EOS>
as
if
you
,
or
anybody
,
could
ever
really
give
serious
credit
to
the
wander
speech
of
a
die
old
man
!
<EOS>
(
where
be
Perrine
?
<EOS>
why
do
you
send
her
away
?
)
<EOS>
I
do
not
wonder
at
your
still
look
a
little
startled
,
and
feel
low
in
your
mind
,
and
all
that
 
for
you
have
have
a
try
night
of
it
,
try
in
every
way
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
be
a
good
deal
shake
in
his
wit
last
night
,
between
fear
about
himself
and
fear
about
me
.
<EOS>
(
to
think
of
my
be
angry
with
you
,
Gabriel
,
for
be
a
little
alarmed
 
very
naturally
 
by
an
old
man
's
queer
fancy
!
)
come
out
,
Perrine
 
come
out
of
the
bedroom
whenever
you
be
tired
of
it
<EOS>
:
you
must
learn
sooner
or
later
to
look
at
death
calmly
.
<EOS>
shake
hand
,
Gabriel
;
and
let
us
make
it
up
,
and
say
no
more
about
what
have
pass
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
?
<EOS>
still
angry
with
me
for
what
I
say
to
you
just
now
?
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
you
will
think
better
about
it
by
the
time
I
return
.
<EOS>
come
out
,
Perrine
;
we
have
no
secret
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
you
go
to
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Gabriel
,
as
he
see
his
father
hastily
open
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
tell
the
priest
that
one
of
his
congregation
be
dead
,
and
to
have
the
death
register
,
"
answer
Francois
.
<EOS>
"
these
be
my
duty
,
and
must
be
perform
before
I
take
any
rest
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
go
out
hurriedly
as
he
say
these
word
.
<EOS>
Gabriel
almost
tremble
at
himself
when
he
find
that
he
breathe
more
freely
,
that
he
feel
less
horribly
oppress
both
in
mind
and
body
,
the
moment
his
father
's
back
be
turn
.
<EOS>
fearful
as
thought
be
now
,
it
be
still
a
change
for
the
well
to
be
capable
of
think
at
all
.
<EOS>
be
the
behavior
of
his
father
compatible
with
innocence
?
<EOS>
Could
the
old
man
's
confused
denial
of
his
own
word
in
the
morning
,
and
in
the
presence
of
his
son
,
be
set
for
one
instant
against
the
circumstantial
confession
that
he
have
make
during
the
night
alone
with
his
grandson
?
<EOS>
these
be
the
terrible
question
which
Gabriel
now
ask
himself
,
and
which
he
shrink
involuntarily
from
answer
.
<EOS>
and
yet
that
doubt
,
the
solution
of
which
would
,
one
way
or
the
other
,
irrevocably
affect
the
whole
future
of
his
life
,
must
sooner
or
later
be
solve
at
any
hazard
!
  
<EOS>
be
there
any
way
of
set
it
at
rest
?
<EOS>
yes
,
one
way
 
to
go
instantly
,
while
his
father
be
absent
,
and
examine
the
hollow
place
under
the
merchant
's
table
.
<EOS>
if
his
grandfather
's
confession
have
really
be
make
while
he
be
in
possession
of
his
sense
,
this
place
(
which
Gabriel
know
to
be
cover
in
from
wind
and
weather
)
have
never
be
visit
since
the
commission
of
the
crime
by
the
perpetrator
,
or
by
his
unwilling
accomplice
;
though
time
have
destroy
all
besides
,
the
hair
and
the
bone
of
the
victim
would
still
be
leave
to
bear
witness
to
the
truth
 
if
truth
have
indeed
be
speak
.
<EOS>
as
this
conviction
grow
on
him
,
the
young
man
's
cheek
pale
;
and
he
stop
irresolute
half
-
way
between
the
hearth
and
the
door
.
<EOS>
then
he
look
down
doubtfully
at
the
corpse
on
the
bed
;
and
then
there
come
upon
him
suddenly
a
revulsion
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
a
wild
,
feverish
impatience
to
know
the
bad
without
another
instant
of
delay
possess
him
.
<EOS>
only
tell
Perrine
that
he
should
be
back
soon
,
and
that
she
must
watch
by
the
dead
in
his
absence
,
he
leave
the
cottage
at
once
,
without
wait
to
hear
her
reply
,
even
without
look
back
as
he
close
the
door
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
two
track
to
the
merchant
's
Table
.
<EOS>
one
,
the
long
of
the
two
,
by
the
coast
cliff
;
the
other
across
the
heath
.
<EOS>
but
this
latter
path
be
also
,
for
some
little
distance
,
the
path
which
lead
to
the
village
and
the
church
.
<EOS>
He
be
afraid
of
attract
his
father
's
attention
here
,
so
he
take
the
direction
of
the
coast
.
<EOS>
at
one
spot
the
track
trend
inland
,
wind
round
some
of
the
many
Druid
monument
scatter
over
the
country
.
<EOS>
this
place
be
on
high
ground
,
and
command
a
view
,
at
no
great
distance
,
of
the
path
lead
to
the
village
,
just
where
it
branch
off
from
the
heathy
ridge
which
run
in
the
direction
of
the
merchant
's
table
.
<EOS>
here
Gabriel
descry
the
figure
of
a
man
stand
with
his
back
toward
the
coast
.
  
<EOS>
this
figure
be
too
far
off
to
be
identify
with
absolute
certainty
,
but
it
look
like
,
and
may
well
be
,
Francois
Sarzeau
.
<EOS>
whoever
he
be
,
the
man
be
evidently
uncertain
which
way
he
should
proceed
.
<EOS>
when
he
move
forward
,
it
be
first
to
advance
several
pace
toward
the
merchant
's
table
;
then
he
go
back
again
toward
the
distant
cottage
and
the
church
.
<EOS>
twice
he
hesitate
thus
;
the
second
time
pause
long
before
he
appear
finally
to
take
the
way
that
lead
to
the
village
.
  
<EOS>
leave
the
post
of
observation
among
the
stone
,
at
which
he
have
instinctively
halt
for
some
minute
past
,
Gabriel
now
proceed
on
his
own
path
.
<EOS>
Could
this
man
really
be
his
father
?
<EOS>
and
if
it
be
so
,
why
do
Francois
Sarzeau
only
determine
to
go
to
the
village
where
his
business
lie
,
after
have
twice
vainly
attempt
to
persevere
in
take
the
exactly
opposite
direction
of
the
merchant
's
table
?
<EOS>
do
he
really
desire
to
go
there
?
<EOS>
have
he
hear
the
name
mention
,
when
the
old
man
refer
to
it
in
his
die
word
?
<EOS>
and
have
he
fail
to
summon
courage
enough
to
make
all
safe
by
remove
 
<EOS>
this
last
question
be
too
horrible
to
be
pursue
;
Gabriel
stifle
it
affrightedly
in
his
own
heart
as
he
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
He
reach
the
great
Druid
monument
without
meet
a
live
soul
on
his
way
.
<EOS>
the
sun
be
rise
,
and
the
mighty
storm
-
cloud
of
the
night
be
part
asunder
wildly
over
the
whole
eastward
horizon
.
<EOS>
the
wave
still
leap
and
foam
gloriously
:
but
the
gale
have
sink
to
a
keen
,
fresh
breeze
.
<EOS>
as
Gabriel
look
up
,
and
see
how
brightly
the
promise
of
a
lovely
day
be
write
in
the
heavens
,
he
tremble
as
he
think
of
the
search
which
he
be
now
about
to
make
.
<EOS>
the
sight
of
the
fair
,
fresh
sunrise
jar
horribly
with
the
suspicion
of
committed
murder
that
be
rankle
foully
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
but
he
know
that
his
errand
must
be
perform
,
and
he
nerve
himself
to
go
through
with
it
;
for
he
dare
not
return
to
the
cottage
until
the
mystery
have
be
clear
up
at
once
and
forever
.
  
<EOS>
the
merchant
's
table
be
form
by
two
huge
stone
rest
horizontally
on
three
other
.
<EOS>
in
the
troubled
time
of
more
than
half
a
century
ago
,
regular
tourist
be
unknown
among
the
Druid
monument
of
Brittany
;
and
the
entrance
to
the
hollow
place
under
the
stone
 
since
often
visit
by
stranger
 
be
at
this
time
nearly
choke
up
by
bramble
and
weed
.
<EOS>
Gabriel
's
first
look
at
this
tangle
nook
of
brier
convince
him
that
the
place
have
not
be
enter
perhaps
for
year
,
by
any
living
being
.
<EOS>
without
allow
himself
to
hesitate
(
for
he
feel
that
the
slight
delay
may
be
fatal
to
his
resolution
)
,
he
pass
as
gently
as
possible
through
the
bramble
,
and
kneel
down
at
the
low
,
dusky
,
irregular
entrance
of
the
hollow
place
under
the
stone
.
  
<EOS>
His
heart
throb
violently
,
his
breath
almost
fail
him
;
but
he
force
himself
to
crawl
a
few
foot
into
the
cavity
,
and
then
grope
with
his
hand
on
the
ground
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
touch
something
!
<EOS>
something
which
it
make
his
flesh
creep
to
handle
;
something
which
he
would
fain
have
drop
,
but
which
he
grasp
tight
in
spite
of
himself
.
<EOS>
He
draw
back
into
the
outer
air
and
sunshine
.
<EOS>
be
it
a
human
bone
?
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
he
have
be
the
dupe
of
his
own
morbid
terror
 
<EOS>
he
have
only
take
up
a
fragment
of
dry
wood
!
  
<EOS>
feel
shame
at
such
self
-
deception
as
this
<EOS>
,
he
be
about
to
throw
the
wood
from
him
before
he
re
-
enter
the
place
,
when
another
idea
occur
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
though
it
be
dimly
light
through
one
or
two
chink
in
the
stone
,
the
far
part
of
the
interior
of
the
cavity
be
still
too
dusky
to
admit
of
perfect
examination
by
the
eye
,
even
on
a
bright
sunshiny
morning
.
<EOS>
observe
this
,
he
take
out
the
tinder
-
box
and
match
,
which
,
like
the
other
inhabitant
of
the
district
,
he
always
carry
about
with
him
for
the
purpose
of
light
his
pipe
,
determine
to
use
the
piece
of
wood
as
a
torch
which
may
illuminate
the
dark
corner
of
the
place
when
he
next
enter
it
.
<EOS>
fortunately
the
wood
have
remain
so
long
and
have
be
preserve
so
dry
in
its
sheltered
position
,
that
it
catch
fire
almost
as
easily
as
a
piece
of
paper
.
<EOS>
the
moment
it
be
fairly
aflame
<EOS>
Gabriel
go
into
the
cavity
,
penetrate
at
once
 
this
time
 
to
its
furth
extremity
.
  
<EOS>
He
remain
among
the
stone
long
enough
for
the
wood
to
burn
down
nearly
to
his
hand
.
<EOS>
when
he
come
out
,
and
fling
the
burn
fragment
from
him
,
his
face
be
flush
deeply
,
his
eye
sparkle
.
<EOS>
He
leap
carelessly
on
to
the
heath
,
over
the
bush
through
which
he
have
thread
his
way
so
warily
<EOS>
but
a
few
minute
before
,
exclaim
,
"
I
may
marry
Perrine
with
a
clear
conscience
now
;
I
be
the
son
of
as
honest
a
man
as
there
be
in
Brittany
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
closely
examine
the
cavity
in
every
corner
,
and
not
the
slight
sign
that
any
dead
body
have
ever
be
lay
<EOS>
there
be
visible
in
the
hollow
place
under
the
merchant
's
Table
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
marry
Perrine
with
a
clear
conscience
now
!
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
some
part
of
the
world
where
it
would
be
draw
no
natural
picture
of
human
nature
to
represent
a
son
as
believe
conscientiously
that
an
offense
against
life
and
the
law
of
hospitality
,
secretly
commit
by
his
father
,
render
him
,
though
innocent
of
all
participation
in
it
,
unworthy
to
fulfill
his
engagement
with
his
affiance
wife
.
<EOS>
among
the
simple
inhabitant
of
Gabriel
's
province
,
however
,
such
acuteness
of
conscientious
sensibility
as
this
be
no
extraordinary
exception
to
all
general
rule
.
<EOS>
ignorant
and
superstitious
as
they
may
be
,
the
people
of
Brittany
practice
the
duty
of
hospitality
as
devoutly
as
they
practice
the
duty
of
the
national
religion
.
<EOS>
the
presence
of
the
stranger
-
guest
,
rich
or
poor
,
be
a
sacred
presence
at
their
hearth
.
<EOS>
His
safety
be
their
especial
charge
,
his
property
their
especial
responsibility
.
<EOS>
They
may
be
half
starve
,
but
they
be
ready
to
share
the
last
crust
with
him
,
nevertheless
,
as
they
would
share
it
with
their
own
child
.
  
<EOS>
any
outrage
on
the
virtue
of
hospitality
,
thus
bear
and
breed
in
the
people
,
be
view
by
them
with
universal
disgust
,
and
punish
with
universal
execration
.
<EOS>
this
ignominy
be
uppermost
in
Gabriel
's
thought
by
the
side
of
his
grandfather
's
bed
;
the
dread
of
this
bad
dishonor
,
which
there
be
no
wipe
out
,
hold
him
speechless
before
Perrine
,
shame
and
horrify
him
so
that
he
feel
unworthy
to
look
her
in
the
face
;
and
when
the
result
of
his
search
at
the
merchant
's
Table
prove
the
absence
there
of
all
evidence
of
the
crime
speak
of
by
the
old
man
,
the
blessed
relief
,
the
absorb
triumph
of
that
discovery
,
be
express
entirely
in
the
one
thought
which
have
prompt
his
first
joyful
word
:
<EOS>
He
could
marry
Perrine
with
a
clear
conscience
,
for
he
be
the
son
of
an
honest
man
!
  
<EOS>
when
he
return
to
the
cottage
,
Francois
have
not
come
back
.
<EOS>
Perrine
be
astonish
at
the
change
in
Gabriel
's
manner
;
even
Pierre
and
the
child
remark
it
.
<EOS>
rest
and
warmth
have
by
this
time
so
far
recover
the
young
brother
,
that
he
be
able
to
give
some
account
of
the
perilous
adventure
of
the
night
at
sea
.
<EOS>
They
be
still
listen
to
the
boy
's
narrative
when
Francois
at
last
return
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
Gabriel
who
hold
out
his
hand
,
and
make
the
first
advance
toward
reconciliation
.
  
<EOS>
to
his
utter
amazement
,
his
father
recoil
from
him
.
<EOS>
the
variable
temper
of
Francois
have
evidently
change
completely
during
his
absence
at
the
village
.
<EOS>
a
settle
scowl
of
distrust
darken
his
face
as
he
look
at
his
son
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
shake
hand
with
people
who
have
once
doubt
me
,
"
he
exclaim
,
loudly
and
irritably
;
"
for
I
always
doubt
them
forever
after
.
<EOS>
You
be
a
bad
son
!
<EOS>
You
have
suspect
your
father
of
some
infamy
that
you
dare
not
openly
charge
him
with
,
on
no
other
testimony
than
the
ramble
nonsense
of
a
half
-
witted
,
die
old
man
.
<EOS>
do
not
speak
to
me
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
hear
you
!
<EOS>
an
innocent
man
and
a
spy
be
bad
company
.
<EOS>
go
and
denounce
me
,
you
Judas
in
disguise
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
for
your
secret
or
for
you
.
<EOS>
what
be
that
girl
<EOS>
Perrine
do
here
still
?
<EOS>
why
have
not
she
go
home
long
ago
?
<EOS>
the
priest
's
come
;
we
do
not
want
stranger
in
the
house
of
death
.
<EOS>
take
her
back
to
the
farmhouse
,
and
stop
there
with
her
,
if
you
like
;
nobody
want
you
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
the
manner
and
look
of
the
speaker
as
he
utter
these
word
,
so
strange
,
so
sinister
,
so
indescribably
suggestive
of
his
meaning
much
more
than
he
say
,
that
Gabriel
feel
his
heart
sink
within
him
instantly
;
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
this
fearful
question
force
itself
irresistibly
on
his
mind
:
may
not
his
father
have
follow
him
to
the
merchant
's
table
?
  
<EOS>
even
if
he
have
be
desire
to
speak
,
he
could
not
have
speak
now
,
while
that
question
and
the
suspicion
that
it
bring
with
it
be
utterly
destroy
all
the
re
-
assuring
hope
and
conviction
of
the
morning
.
<EOS>
the
mental
suffering
produce
by
the
sudden
change
from
pleasure
to
pain
in
all
his
thought
,
react
on
him
physically
.
<EOS>
He
feel
as
if
he
be
stifle
in
the
air
of
the
cottage
,
in
the
presence
of
his
father
;
and
when
Perrine
hurry
on
her
walking
attire
,
and
with
a
face
which
alternately
flush
and
turn
pale
with
every
moment
,
approach
the
door
,
he
go
out
with
her
as
hastily
as
if
he
have
be
fly
from
his
home
.
<EOS>
never
have
the
fresh
air
and
the
free
daylight
feel
like
heavenly
and
guardian
influence
to
him
until
now
!
  
<EOS>
He
could
comfort
Perrine
under
his
father
's
harshness
,
he
could
assure
her
of
his
own
affection
,
which
no
earthly
influence
could
change
,
while
they
walk
together
toward
the
farmhouse
;
but
he
could
do
no
more
.
<EOS>
He
durst
not
confide
to
her
the
subject
that
be
uppermost
in
his
mind
;
of
all
human
being
she
be
the
last
to
whom
he
could
reveal
the
terrible
secret
that
be
fester
at
his
heart
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
get
within
sight
of
the
farmhouse
,
Gabriel
stop
;
and
,
promise
to
see
her
again
soon
,
take
leave
of
Perrine
with
assumed
ease
in
his
manner
and
with
real
despair
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
whatever
the
poor
girl
may
think
of
it
,
he
feel
,
at
that
moment
,
that
he
have
not
courage
to
face
her
father
,
and
hear
him
talk
happily
and
pleasantly
,
as
his
custom
be
,
of
Perrine
's
approach
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
leave
to
himself
,
Gabriel
wander
hither
and
thither
over
the
open
heath
,
neither
know
nor
care
in
what
direction
<EOS>
he
turn
his
step
.
<EOS>
the
doubt
about
his
father
's
innocence
which
have
be
dissipate
by
his
visit
to
the
merchant
's
Table
,
that
father
's
own
language
and
manner
have
now
revive
 
have
even
confirm
,
though
he
dare
not
yet
acknowledge
so
much
to
himself
.
<EOS>
It
be
terrible
enough
to
be
oblige
to
admit
that
the
result
of
his
morning
's
search
be
,
after
all
,
not
conclusive
 
that
the
mystery
be
,
in
very
truth
,
not
yet
clear
up
.
<EOS>
the
violence
of
his
father
's
last
word
of
distrust
;
the
extraordinary
and
indescribable
change
in
his
father
's
manner
while
utter
them
 
what
do
these
thing
mean
?
<EOS>
guilt
or
innocence
?
<EOS>
again
,
be
it
any
longer
reasonable
to
doubt
the
death
-
bed
confession
make
by
his
grandfather
?
<EOS>
be
it
not
,
on
the
contrary
,
far
more
probable
that
the
old
man
's
denial
in
the
morning
of
his
own
word
at
night
have
be
make
under
the
influence
of
a
panic
terror
,
when
his
moral
consciousness
be
bewilder
,
and
his
intellectual
faculty
be
sink
?
<EOS>
the
long
Gabriel
think
of
these
question
,
the
less
competent
 
possibly
also
the
less
willing
 
<EOS>
he
feel
to
answer
them
.
<EOS>
Should
he
seek
advice
from
other
wise
than
he
?
<EOS>
no
;
not
while
the
thousandth
part
of
a
chance
remain
that
his
father
be
innocent
.
  
<EOS>
this
thought
be
still
in
his
mind
,
when
he
find
himself
once
more
in
sight
of
his
home
.
<EOS>
He
be
still
hesitate
near
the
door
,
when
he
see
it
open
cautiously
.
<EOS>
His
brother
Pierre
look
out
,
and
then
come
run
toward
him
.
<EOS>
"
come
in
,
Gabriel
;
oh
,
do
come
in
!
"
<EOS>
say
the
boy
,
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
afraid
to
be
alone
with
father
.
<EOS>
He
be
be
beat
us
for
talk
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
go
in
.
<EOS>
His
father
look
up
from
the
hearth
where
he
be
sit
,
mutter
the
word
"
Spy
!
"
and
make
a
gesture
of
contempt
but
do
not
address
a
word
directly
to
his
son
.
<EOS>
the
hour
pass
on
in
silence
;
afternoon
wane
into
evening
,
and
evening
into
night
;
and
still
he
never
speak
to
any
of
his
child
.
<EOS>
soon
after
it
be
dark
,
he
go
out
,
and
take
his
net
with
him
,
say
that
it
be
well
to
be
alone
on
the
sea
than
in
the
house
with
a
spy
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
return
the
next
morning
there
be
no
change
in
him
.
<EOS>
day
pass
 
week
,
month
,
even
elapse
,
and
still
,
though
his
manner
insensibly
become
what
it
use
to
be
toward
his
other
child
,
it
never
alter
toward
his
eld
son
at
the
rare
period
when
they
now
meet
,
except
when
absolutely
oblige
to
speak
,
he
preserve
total
silence
in
his
intercourse
with
Gabriel
.
<EOS>
He
would
never
take
Gabriel
out
with
him
in
the
boat
;
he
would
never
sit
alone
with
Gabriel
in
the
house
;
he
would
never
eat
a
meal
with
Gabriel
;
he
would
never
let
the
other
child
talk
to
him
about
Gabriel
;
and
he
would
never
hear
a
word
in
expostulation
,
a
word
in
reference
to
anything
his
dead
father
have
say
or
do
on
the
night
of
the
storm
,
from
Gabriel
himself
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
man
pine
and
change
,
so
that
even
Perrine
hardly
know
him
again
,
under
this
cruel
system
of
domestic
excommunication
;
under
the
wear
influence
of
the
one
unchanging
doubt
which
never
leave
him
;
and
,
more
than
all
,
under
the
incessant
reproach
of
his
own
conscience
,
arouse
by
the
sense
that
he
be
evade
a
responsibility
which
it
be
his
solemn
,
his
immediate
duty
to
undertake
.
<EOS>
but
no
sting
of
conscience
,
no
ill
treatment
at
home
,
and
no
self
-
reproach
for
fail
in
his
duty
of
confession
as
a
good
Catholic
,
be
powerful
enough
in
their
influence
over
Gabriel
to
make
him
disclose
the
secret
,
under
the
oppression
of
which
his
very
life
be
waste
away
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
if
he
once
reveal
it
,
whether
his
father
be
ultimately
prove
to
be
guilty
or
innocent

there
would

a
slur

a
suspicion
on
the

on
Perrine

from
her

connection
with
it

which
in
their

<EOS>
the
reproach

terrible
even
in
the
crowded
city

where
many
of
the
dweller
in
our
abiding

place
be
stranger
to
us
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
far
more
terrible
in
the
country

where
none

be
stranger

where
all
talk

They

the

they

<EOS>
one
evening
,
while
this
frightful
persecution
be
still
rage
,
Gabriel
happen
to
be
detain
unusually
late
at
the
cottage
of
Perrine
's
father
.
<EOS>
He
have
lately
spend
much
of
his
time
at
the
farm
house
;
it
be
his
only
refuge
now
from
that
place
of
suffering
,
of
silence
,
and
of
secret
shame
,
which
he
have
once
call
home
!
<EOS>
just
as
he
have
take
leave
of
Perrine
for
the
night
,
and
be
about
to
open
the
farmhouse
door
,
her
father
stop
him
,
and
point
to
a
chair
in
the
chimney
-
corner
.
  
<EOS>
"
leave
us
alone
,
my
dear
,
"
say
the
old
man
to
his
daughter
;
"
I
want
to
speak
to
Gabriel
.
<EOS>
You
can
go
to
your
mother
in
the
next
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
word
which
Pere
Bonan
 
as
he
be
call
by
the
neighbor
 
have
now
to
say
in
private
be
destine
to
lead
to
very
unexpected
event
.
<EOS>
after
refer
to
the
alteration
which
have
appear
of
late
in
Gabriel
's
manner
,
the
old
man
begin
by
ask
him
,
sorrowfully
but
not
suspiciously
,
whether
he
still
preserve
his
old
affection
for
Perrine
.
<EOS>
on
receive
an
eager
answer
in
the
affirmative
,
Pere
Bonan
then
refer
to
the
persecution
still
rage
through
the
country
,
and
to
the
consequent
possibility
that
he
,
like
other
of
his
countryman
,
may
yet
be
call
to
suffer
,
and
perhaps
to
die
,
for
the
cause
of
his
religion
.
<EOS>
if
this
last
act
of
self
-
sacrifice
be
require
of
him
,
Perrine
would
be
leave
unprotected
,
unless
her
affiance
husband
perform
his
promise
to
her
,
and
assume
,
without
delay
,
the
position
of
her
lawful
guardian
.
<EOS>
"
let
me
know
that
you
will
do
this
,
"
conclude
the
old
man
;
"
I
shall
be
resign
to
all
that
may
be
require
of
me
,
if
I
can
only
know
that
I
shall
not
die
leave
Perrine
unprotecte
.
<EOS>
"
Gabriel
give
the
promise
 
give
it
with
his
whole
heart
.
<EOS>
as
he
take
leave
of
Pere
Bonan
,
the
old
man
say
to
him
:
  
"
come
here
to
-
morrow
;
I
shall
know
more
then
than
I
know
now
 
I
shall
be
able
to
fix
with
certainty
the
day
for
the
fulfillment
of
your
engagement
with
Perrine
.
"
  
<EOS>
why
do
Gabriel
hesitate
at
the
farmhouse
door
,
look
back
on
Pere
Bonan
as
though
he
would
fain
say
something
,
and
yet
not
speak
a
word
?
<EOS>
why
,
after
he
have
go
out
and
have
walk
onward
several
pace
,
do
he
suddenly
stop
,
return
quickly
to
the
farmhouse
,
stand
irresolute
before
the
gate
,
and
then
retrace
his
step
,
sigh
heavily
as
he
go
,
but
never
pause
again
on
his
homeward
way
?
<EOS>
because
the
torment
of
his
horrible
secret
have
grow
harder
to
bear
than
ever
,
since
he
have
give
the
promise
that
have
be
require
of
him
.
<EOS>
because
,
while
a
strong
impulse
move
him
frankly
to
lay
bare
his
hidden
dread
and
doubt
to
the
father
whose
beloved
daughter
be
soon
to
be
his
wife
,
there
be
a
yet
strong
passive
influence
which
paralyze
on
his
lip
the
terrible
confession
that
he
know
not
whether
he
be
the
son
of
an
honest
man
,
or
the
son
of
an
assassin
,
and
a
robber
.
<EOS>
make
desperate
by
his
situation
,
he
determine
,
while
he
hasten
homeward
,
to
risk
the
bad
,
and
ask
that
fatal
question
of
his
father
in
plain
word
.
<EOS>
but
this
supreme
trial
for
parent
and
child
be
not
to
be
.
<EOS>
when
he
enter
the
cottage
,
Francois
be
absent
.
<EOS>
He
have
tell
the
young
child
that
he
should
not
be
home
again
before
noon
on
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
early
in
the
morning
Gabriel
repair
to
the
farmhouse
,
as
he
have
be
bid
.
<EOS>
influence
,
by
his
love
for
Perrine
,
blindly
confide
in
the
faint
hope
(
which
,
in
despite
of
heart
and
conscience
,
he
still
force
himself
to
cherish
)
that
his
father
may
be
innocent
,
he
now
preserve
the
appearance
at
least
of
perfect
calmness
.
<EOS>
"
if
I
tell
my
secret
to
Perrine
's
father
,
I
risk
disturb
in
him
that
confidence
in
the
future
safety
of
his
child
for
which
I
be
his
present
and
only
warrant
.
"
something
like
this
thought
be
in
Gabriel
's
mind
,
as
he
take
the
hand
of
Pere
Bonan
,
and
wait
anxiously
to
hear
what
be
require
of
him
on
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
a
short
respite
from
danger

Gabriel

say
the

<EOS>
News
have
come
to
me
that
the
spoiler
of
our
church
and
the
murderer
of
our
congregation
have
be
stop
on
their
way
hitherward
by
tiding
which
have
reach
them
from
another
district
.
<EOS>
this
interval
of
peace
and
safety
will
be
a
short
one
 
we
must
take
advantage
of
it
while
it
be
yet
ours
.
<EOS>
My
name
be
among
the
name
on
the
list
of
the
denounce
.
<EOS>
if
the
soldier
of
the
Republic
find
me
here
 
<EOS>
but
we
will
say
nothing
more
of
this
;
it
be
of
Perrine
and
of
you
that
I
must
now
speak
.
<EOS>
on
this
very
evening
your
marriage
may
be
solemnize
with
all
the
wonte
rite
of
our
holy
religion
,
and
the
blessing
may
be
pronounce
over
you
by
the
lip
of
a
priest
.
<EOS>
this
evening
,
therefore
,
Gabriel
,
you
must
become
the
husband
and
the
protector
of
Perrine
.
<EOS>
listen
to
me
attentively
,
and
I
will
tell
you
how
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
substance
of
what
Gabriel
now
hear
from
Pere
Bonan
:
  
not
very
long
before
the
persecution
break
out
in
Brittany
,
a
priest
,
know
generally
by
the
name
of
Father
Paul
,
be
appoint
to
a
curacy
in
one
of
the
northern
district
of
the
province
.
<EOS>
He
fulfil
all
the
duty
of
his
station
in
such
a
manner
as
to
win
the
confidence
and
affection
of
every
member
of
his
congregation
,
and
be
often
speak
of
with
respect
,
even
in
part
of
the
country
distant
from
the
scene
of
his
labor
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
,
however
,
until
the
trouble
break
out
,
and
the
destruction
and
bloodshed
begin
,
that
he
become
renowned
far
and
wide
,
from
one
end
of
Brittany
to
another
.
<EOS>
from
the
date
of
the
very
first
persecution
the
name
of
Father
Paul
be
a
rallying
-
cry
of
the
hunt
peasantry
;
he
be
their
great
encouragement
under
oppression
,
their
example
in
danger
,
their
last
and
only
consoler
in
the
hour
of
death
.
<EOS>
wherever
havoc
and
ruin
rage
most
fiercely
,
wherever
the
pursuit
be
hot
and
the
slaughter
most
cruel
,
there
the
intrepid
priest
be
sure
to
be
see
pursue
his
sacred
duty
in
defiance
of
every
peril
.
<EOS>
His
hair
-
breadth
escape
from
death
;
his
extraordinary
re
-
appearance
in
part
of
the
country
where
no
one
ever
expect
to
see
him
again
,
be
regard
by
the
poor
class
with
superstitious
awe
.
<EOS>
wherever
Father
Paul
appear
,
with
his
black
dress
,
his
calm
face
,
and
the
ivory
crucifix
which
he
always
carry
in
his
hand
,
the
people
reverence
him
as
more
than
mortal
;
and
grow
at
last
to
believe
,
that
,
single
-
handed
,
he
would
successfully
defend
his
religion
against
the
army
of
the
Republic
.
<EOS>
but
their
simple
confidence
in
his
power
of
resistance
be
soon
destine
to
be
shake

one
morning
,
after
celebrate
service
in
a
dismantled
church

and
after
narrowly
escape
with
his
life
from
those
who
pursue
him
,
the

disappear
.
<EOS>
secret
inquiry
be

after
him
in
all
direction

but
he
be
hear
of
no

<EOS>
many
weary
day
have
pass
,
and
the
dispirit
peasantry
have
already
mourn
him
as
dead
,
when
some
fisherman
on
the
northern
coast
observe
a
ship
of
light
burden
in
the
offing
,
make
signal
to
the
shore

They

the

<EOS>
raze
from
the
face
of
the
earth

their
church
have
not

for
Father
Paul
and
the
priest
who
act
with
him
have
give
that
church
a
refuge
on
the
sea
.
<EOS>
henceforth
,
their
child
could
still
be
baptize
,
their
son
and
daughter
could
still
be
marry
,
the
burial
of
their

,
under
the
sanction
of

for
which

not
vainly

throughout

toward
such
part

on

<EOS>
the

of
the
priest
on
board
be
clothe
in
their
robe
of
office
,
and
be
wait
in
their
appoint
place
to
begin
the
service
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
third
,
dress
only
in
the
ordinary
attire
of
his
calling
,
who
mingle
with
the
congregation
,
and
speak
a
few
word
to
each
of
the
person
compose
it
,
as
,
one
by
one
<EOS>
,
they
mount
the
side
of
the
ship
.
<EOS>
those
who
have
never
see
him
before
know
by
the
famous
ivory
crucifix
in
his
hand
that
the
priest
who
receive
them
be
Father
Paul
.
<EOS>
Gabriel
look
at
this
man
,
whom
he
now
beheld
for
the
first
time
,
with
a
mixture
of
astonishment
and
awe
;
for
he
see
that
the
renowned
chief
of
the
Christians
of
Brittany
be
,
to
all
appearance
,
but
little
old
than
himself
.
  
<EOS>
the
expression
on
the
pale
,
calm
face
of
the
priest
be
so
gentle
and
kind
,
that
child
just
able
to
walk
totter
up
to
him
,
and
hold
familiarly
by
the
skirt
of
his
black
gown
,
whenever
his
clear
blue
eye
rest
on
theirs
,
while
he
beckon
them
to
his
side
.
<EOS>
no
one
would
ever
have
guess
from
the
countenance
of
Father
Paul
what
deadly
peril
he
have
confront
,
but
for
the
scar
of
a
saber
-
wound
,
as
yet
hardly
heal
,
which
run
across
his
forehead
.
<EOS>
that
wound
have
be
deal
while
he
be
kneel
before
the
altar
in
the
last
church
in
Brittany
which
have
escape
spoliation
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
die
where
he
kneel
,
but
for
the
peasant
who
be
pray
with
him
,
and
who
,
unarmed
as
they
be
,
throw
themselves
like
tiger
on
the
soldiery
,
and
at
awful
sacrifice
of
their
own
life
save
the
life
of
their
priest
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
man
now
on
board
the
ship
who
would
have
hesitate
,
have
the
occasion
call
for
it
again
,
to
have
rescue
him
in
the
same
way
.
  
<EOS>
the
service
begin
.
<EOS>
since
the
day
when
the
primitive
Christians
worship
amid
the
cavern
of
the
earth
,
can
any
service
be
imagine
noble
in
itself
,
or
sublimer
in
the
circumstance
surround
it
,
than
that
which
be
now
offer
up
?
<EOS>
here
be
no
artificial
pomp
,
no
gaudy
profusion
of
ornament
,
no
attendant
grandeur
of
man
's
creation
.
<EOS>
all
around
this
church
spread
the
hushed
and
awful
majesty
of
the
tranquil
sea
.
<EOS>
the
roof
of
this
cathedral
be
the
immeasurable
heaven
,
the
pure
moon
<EOS>
its
one
great
light
,
the
countless
glory
of
the
star
its
only
adornment
.
<EOS>
here
be
no
hire
singer
or
rich
priest
-
prince
;
no
curious
sight
-
seer
,
or
careless
lover
of
sweet
sound
.
<EOS>
this
congregation
and
they
who
have
gather
it
together
,
be
all
poor
alike
,
all
persecute
alike
,
all
worship
alike
,
to
the
overthrow
of
their
worldly
interest
,
and
at
the
imminent
peril
of
their
life
.
<EOS>
how
brightly
and
tenderly
the
moonlight
shine
upon
the
altar
and
the
people
before
it
!
<EOS>
how
solemnly
and
divinely
the
deep
harmony
,
as
they
chant
the
penitential
Psalms
,
mingle
with
the
hoarse
singing
of
the
freshen
night
breeze
in
the
rigging
of
the
ship
!
<EOS>
how
sweetly
the
still
rush
murmur
of
many
voice
,
as
they
utter
the
response
together
,
now
die
away
,
and
now
rise
again
softly
into
the
mysterious
night
!
  
<EOS>
of
all
the
member
of
the
congregation
 
young
or
old
 
there
be
but
one
over
whom
that
impressive
service
exercise
no
influence
of
consolation
or
of
peace
;
that
one
be
Gabriel
.
<EOS>
often
,
throughout
the
day
,
his
reproaching
conscience
have
speak
within
him
again
and
again
.
<EOS>
often
when
he
join
the
little
assembly
on
the
beach
,
he
turn
away
his
face
in
secret
shame
and
apprehension
from
Perrine
and
her
father
.
<EOS>
vainly
,
after
gain
the
deck
of
the
ship
,
do
he
try
to
meet
the
eye
of
Father
Paul
as
frankly
,
as
readily
,
and
as
affectionately
as
other
meet
it
.
<EOS>
the
burden
of
concealment
seem
too
heavy
to
be
bear
in
the
presence
of
the
priest
 
and
yet
,
torment
as
it
be
,
he
still
bear
it
!
<EOS>
but
when
he
kneel
with
the
rest
of
the
congregation
and
see
Perrine
kneel
by
his
side
 
when
he
feel
the
calmness
of
the
solemn
night
and
the
still
sea
fill
his
heart
 
<EOS>
when
the
sound
of
the
first
prayer
speak
with
a
dread
spiritual
language
of
their
own
to
his
soul
 
<EOS>
then
the
remembrance
of
the
confession
which
he
have
neglect
,
and
the
terror
of
receive
unprepared
the
sacrament
which
he
know
would
be
offer
to
him
 
grow
too
vivid
to
be
endure
;
the
sense
that
he
merit
no
longer
,
though
once
worthy
of
it
,
the
confidence
in
his
perfect
truth
and
candor
place
in
him
by
the
woman
with
whom
he
be
soon
to
stand
before
the
altar
,
overwhelm
him
with
shame
:
the
mere
act
of
kneel
among
that
congregation
,
the
passive
accomplice
by
his
silence
and
secrecy
,
for
aught
he
know
to
the
contrary
,
of
a
crime
which
it
be
his
bounden
duty
to
denounce
,
appal
him
as
if
he
have
already
commit
sacrilege
that
could
never
be
forgive
.
<EOS>
tear
flow
down
his
cheek
,
though
he
strove
to
repress
them
:
sobs
burst
from
him
,
though
he
try
to
stifle
them
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
other
besides
Perrine
be
look
at
him
in
astonishment
and
alarm
;
but
he
could
neither
control
himself
,
nor
move
to
leave
his
place
,
nor
raise
his
eye
<EOS>
even
 
until
suddenly
he
feel
a
hand
lay
on
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
that
touch
,
slight
as
it
be
,
run
through
him
instantly
He
look
up
,
and
see
Father
Paul
stand
by
his
side
.
  
<EOS>
beckon
him
to
follow
,
and
sign
to
the
congregation
not
to
suspend
their
devotion
,
he
lead
Gabriel
out
of
the
assembly
 
then
pause
for
a
moment
,
reflect
 
then
beckon
him
again
,
take
him
into
the
cabin
of
the
ship
,
and
close
the
door
carefully
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
something
on
your
mind
,
"
he
say
,
simply
and
quietly
,
take
the
young
man
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
be
able
to
relieve
you
,
if
you
tell
me
what
it
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
Gabriel
hear
these
gentle
word
,
and
see
,
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
which
burn
before
a
cross
fix
against
the
wall
,
the
sad
kindness
of
expression
with
which
the
priest
be
regard
him
,
the
oppression
that
have
lain
so
long
on
his
heart
seem
to
leave
it
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
the
haunting
fear
of
ever
divulge
his
fatal
suspicion
and
his
fatal
secret
have
vanish
,
as
it
be
,
at
the
touch
of
Father
Paul
's
hand
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
he
now
repeat
to
another
ear
 
<EOS>
the
sound
of
prayer
and
praise
rise
grandly
the
while
from
the
congregation
above
 
his
grandfather
's
death
-
bed
confession
,
word
for
word
almost
,
as
he
have
hear
it
in
the
cottage
on
the
night
of
the
storm
.
  
<EOS>
once
,
and
once
only
,
do
Father
Paul
interrupt
the
narrative
,
which
in
whisper
be
address
to
him
.
<EOS>
Gabriel
have
hardly
repeat
the
first
two
or
three
sentence
of
his
grandfather
's
confession
,
when
the
priest
,
in
quick
,
altered
tone
,
abruptly
ask
him
his
name
and
place
of
abode
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
question
be
answer
,
Father
Paul
's
calm
face
become
suddenly
agitate
;
but
the
next
moment
,
resolutely
resume
his
self
-
possession
,
he
bow
his
head
as
a
sign
that
Gabriel
be
to
continue
;
clasp
his
tremble
hand
,
and
raise
them
as
if
in
silent
prayer
,
fix
his
eye
intently
on
the
cross
.
<EOS>
He
never
look
away
from
it
while
the
terrible
narrative
proceed
.
<EOS>
but
when
Gabriel
describe
his
search
at
the
merchant
's
table
;
and
,
refer
to
his
father
's
behavior
since
that
time
,
appeal
to
the
priest
to
know
whether
he
may
even
yet
,
in
defiance
of
appearance
,
be
still
filially
justified
in
doubt
whether
the
crime
have
be
really
perpetrate
 
then
Father
Paul
move
near
to
him
once
more
,
and
speak
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
compose
yourself
,
and
look
at
me
,
"
he
say
,
with
his
former
sad
kindness
of
voice
and
manner
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
end
your
doubt
forever
.
<EOS>
Gabriel
,
your
father
be
guilty
in
intention
and
in
act
;
but
the
victim
of
his
crime
still
live
.
<EOS>
I
can
prove
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
's
heart
beat
wildly
;
a
deadly
coldness
crept
over
him
as
he
see
Father
Paul
loosen
the
fastening
of
his
cassock
round
the
throat
.
  
<EOS>
at
that
instant
the
chanting
of
the
congregation
above
cease
;
and
then
the
sudden
and
awful
stillness
be
deepen
rather
than
interrupt
by
the
faint
sound
of
one
voice
pray
.
<EOS>
slowly
and
with
tremble
finger
the
priest
remove
the
band
round
<EOS>
his
neck
 
pause
a
little
 
sigh
heavily
 
and
point
to
a
scar
which
be
now
plainly
visible
on
one
side
of
his
throat
.
<EOS>
He
say
something
at
the
same
time
;
but
the
bell
above
toll
while
he
speak
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
signal
of
the
elevation
of
the
Host
.
<EOS>
Gabriel
feel
an
arm
pass
round
him
,
guide
him
to
his
knee
,
and
sustain
him
from
sink
to
the
floor
.
<EOS>
for
one
moment
longer
he
be
conscious
that
the
bell
have
stop
,
that
there
be
dead
silence
,
that
Father
Paul
be
kneel
by
him
beneath
the
cross
,
with
bowed
head
 
then
all
object
around
vanish
;
and
he
see
and
know
nothing
more
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
recover
his
sense
,
he
be
still
in
the
cabin
;
the
man
whose
life
his
father
have
attempt
be
bend
over
him
,
and
sprinkle
water
on
his
face
;
and
the
clear
voice
of
the
woman
and
child
of
the
congregation
be
join
the
voice
of
the
man
in
singe
the
Agnus
Dei
.
 
<EOS>
"
look
up
at
me
without
fear
,
Gabriel
,
"
say
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
I
desire
not
to
avenge
injury
:
I
visit
not
the
sin
of
the
father
on
the
child
.
<EOS>
look
up
,
and
listen
!
<EOS>
I
have
strange
thing
to
speak
of
;
and
I
have
a
sacred
mission
to
fulfill
before
the
morning
,
in
which
you
must
be
my
guide
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
attempt
to
kneel
and
kiss
his
hand
but
Father
Paul
stop
him
,
and
say
,
point
to
the
cross
:
"
Kneel
to
that
 
not
to
me
;
not
to
your
fellow
-
mortal
,
and
your
friend
 
for
I
will
be
your
friend
,
Gabriel
;
believe
that
God
's
mercy
have
order
it
so
.
<EOS>
and
now
listen
to
me
,
"
he
proceed
,
with
a
brotherly
tenderness
in
his
manner
which
go
to
Gabriel
's
heart
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
service
be
nearly
end
.
<EOS>
what
I
have
to
tell
you
must
be
tell
at
once
;
the
errand
on
which
you
will
guide
me
must
be
perform
before
to
-
morrow
dawn
.
<EOS>
sit
here
near
me
,
and
attend
to
what
I
now
say
!
"
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
obey
;
Father
Paul
then
proceed
thus
:
  
"
<EOS>
I
believe
the
confession
make
to
you
by
your
grandfather
to
have
be
true
in
every
particular
.
<EOS>
on
the
evening
to
which
he
refer
you
,
I
approach
your
cottage
,
as
he
say
,
for
the
purpose
of
ask
shelter
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
at
that
period
I
have
be
study
hard
to
qualify
myself
for
the
holy
calling
which
I
now
pursue
;
and
,
on
the
completion
of
my
study
,
have
indulge
in
the
recreation
of
a
tour
on
foot
through
Brittany
,
by
way
of
innocently
and
agreeably
occupy
the
leisure
time
then
at
my
disposal
,
before
I
enter
the
priesthood
.
<EOS>
when
I
accost
your
father
I
have
lose
my
way
,
have
be
walk
for
many
hour
,
and
be
glad
of
any
rest
that
I
could
get
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
It
be
unnecessary
to
pain
you
now
,
by
reference
to
the
event
which
follow
my
entrance
under
your
father
's
roof
.
<EOS>
I
remember
nothing
that
happen
from
the
time
when
I
lie
down
to
sleep
before
the
fire
,
until
the
time
when
I
recover
my
sense
at
the
place
which
you
call
the
merchant
's
table
.
<EOS>
My
first
sensation
be
that
of
be
move
into
the
cold
air
;
when
I
open
my
eye
I
see
the
great
Druid
stone
rise
close
above
me
,
and
two
man
on
either
side
of
me
rifle
my
pocket
.
<EOS>
They
find
nothing
valuable
there
,
and
be
about
to
leave
me
where
I
lay
,
when
I
gather
strength
enough
to
appeal
to
their
mercy
through
their
cupidity
.
<EOS>
money
be
not
scarce
with
me
then
,
and
I
be
able
to
offer
them
a
rich
reward
(
which
they
ultimately
receive
as
I
have
promise
)
if
they
would
take
me
to
any
place
where
I
could
get
shelter
and
medical
help
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
infer
by
my
language
and
accent
 
perhaps
also
by
the
linen
I
wear
,
which
they
examine
closely
 
that
I
belong
to
the
high
rank
of
the
community
,
in
spite
of
the
plainness
of
my
outer
garment
;
and
may
,
therefore
,
be
in
a
position
to
make
good
my
promise
to
them
.
<EOS>
I
hear
one
say
to
the
other
,
"
let
us
risk
it
'
;
and
then
they
take
me
in
their
arm
,
carry
me
down
to
a
boat
on
the
beach
,
and
row
to
a
vessel
in
the
offing
.
<EOS>
the
next
day
they
disembark
me
at
Paimboeuf
,
where
I
get
the
assistance
which
I
so
much
need
.
<EOS>
I
learn
,
through
the
confidence
they
be
oblige
to
place
in
me
in
order
to
give
me
the
mean
of
send
them
their
promise
reward
,
that
these
man
be
smuggler
,
and
that
they
be
in
the
habit
of
use
the
cavity
in
which
I
have
be
lay
as
a
place
of
concealment
for
good
,
and
for
letter
of
advice
to
their
accomplice
.
<EOS>
this
account
for
their
find
me
.
<EOS>
as
to
my
wound
,
I
be
inform
by
the
surgeon
who
attend
me
that
it
have
miss
be
inflict
in
a
mortal
part
by
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
inch
,
and
that
,
as
it
be
,
nothing
but
the
action
of
the
night
air
in
coagulate
the
blood
over
the
place
,
have
,
in
the
first
instance
,
save
my
life
.
<EOS>
to
be
brief
,
I
recover
after
a
long
illness
,
return
to
Paris
,
and
be
call
to
the
priesthood
.
<EOS>
the
will
of
my
superior
oblige
me
to
perform
the
first
duty
of
my
vocation
in
the
great
city
;
but
my
own
wish
be
to
be
appoint
to
a
cure
of
soul
in
your
province
,
Gabriel
.
<EOS>
Can
you
imagine
why
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
answer
to
this
question
be
in
Gabriel
's
heart
;
but
he
be
still
too
deeply
awed
and
affect
by
what
he
have
hear
to
give
it
utterance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
tell
you
,
then
,
what
my
motive
be
,
"
say
Father
Paul
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
first
that
I
uniformly
abstain
from
disclose
to
any
one
where
and
by
whom
my
life
have
be
attempt
.
<EOS>
I
keep
this
a
secret
from
the
man
who
rescue
me
 
from
the
surgeon
 
from
my
own
friend
even
.
<EOS>
My
reason
for
such
a
proceeding
be
,
I
would
fain
believe
,
a
christian
reason
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
always
feel
a
sincere
and
humble
desire
to
prove
myself
,
by
the
help
of
God
,
worthy
of
the
sacred
vocation
to
which
I
be
destine
.
<EOS>
but
my
miraculous
escape
from
death
make
an
impression
on
my
mind
,
which
give
me
another
and
an
infinitely
high
view
of
this
vocation
 
<EOS>
the
view
which
I
have
since
striven
,
and
shall
always
strive
for
the
future
,
to
maintain
.
<EOS>
as
I
lie
,
during
the
first
day
of
my
recovery
,
examine
my
own
heart
,
and
consider
in
what
manner
it
would
be
my
duty
to
act
toward
your
father
when
I
be
restore
to
health
,
a
thought
come
into
my
mind
which
calm
,
comfort
,
and
resolve
all
my
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
say
within
myself
,
"
in
a
few
month
more
I
shall
be
call
to
be
one
of
the
choose
minister
of
God
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
worthy
of
my
vocation
,
my
first
desire
toward
this
man
who
have
attempt
to
take
my
life
should
be
,
not
to
know
that
human
justice
have
overtake
him
,
but
to
know
that
he
have
truly
and
religiously
repent
and
make
atonement
for
his
guilt
.
<EOS>
to
such
repentance
and
atonement
let
it
be
my
duty
to
call
him
;
if
he
reject
that
appeal
,
and
be
harden
only
the
more
against
me
because
I
have
forgive
him
my
injury
,
then
it
will
be
time
enough
to
denounce
him
for
his
crime
to
his
fellow
-
man
.
<EOS>
surely
it
must
be
well
for
me
,
here
and
hereafter
,
if
I
begin
my
career
in
the
holy
priesthood
by
help
to
save
from
hell
the
soul
of
the
man
who
,
of
all
other
,
have
most
cruelly
wrong
me
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
for
this
reason
,
Gabriel
 
<EOS>
it
be
because
I
desire
to
go
straightway
to
your
father
's
cottage
,
and
reclaim
him
after
he
have
believe
me
to
be
dead
 
that
I
keep
the
secret
and
entreat
of
my
superior
that
I
may
be
send
to
Brittany
.
<EOS>
but
this
,
as
I
have
say
,
be
not
to
be
at
first
,
and
when
my
desire
be
grant
,
my
place
be
assign
me
in
a
far
district
.
<EOS>
the
persecution
under
which
we
still
suffer
break
out
;
the
design
of
my
life
be
change
;
my
own
will
become
no
longer
mine
to
guide
me
.
<EOS>
but
,
through
sorrow
and
suffering
,
and
danger
and
bloodshe
,
I
be
now
lead
,
after
many
day
,
to
the
execution
of
that
first
purpose
which
I

on
enter

when

He

in

Father

when

They

on
a

moonlight
night
Francois

have
stand
on

year
since
,
with
a
bleed
body
in
his

<EOS>
on
a
lovely
moonlight
night
he

stand
there
again
,
confront
the
very
man
whose
life
he
have
attempt
,
and
know
him
not

<EOS>
Father
Paul
advance
a
few
pace
,
so
that
the
moonlight
fall
full
on
his
feature
,
and
remove
his
hat
.
  
<EOS>
Francois
Sarzeau
look
,
start
,
move
one
step
back
,
then
stand
motionless
and
perfectly
silent
,
while
all
trace
of
expression
of
any
kind
suddenly
vanish
from
his
face
.
<EOS>
then
the
calm
,
clear
tone
of
the
priest
steal
gently
on
the
dead
silence
.
<EOS>
"
I
bring
a
message
of
peace
and
forgiveness
from
a
guest
of
former
year
,
"
he
say
;
and
point
,
as
he
speak
,
to
the
place
where
he
have
be
wound
in
the
neck
.
  
<EOS>
for
one
moment
,
Gabriel
see
his
father
tremble
violently
from
head
to
foot
 
<EOS>
then
his
limb
steady
again
 
<EOS>
stiffen
suddenly
,
as
if
strike
by
catalepsy
.
<EOS>
His
lip
part
,
but
without
quiver
;
his
eye
glare
,
but
without
move
in
the
orbit
.
<EOS>
the
lovely
moonlight
itself
look
ghastly
and
horrible
,
shine
on
the
supernatural
panic
deformity
of
that
face
!
<EOS>
Gabriel
turn
away
his
head
in
terror
.
<EOS>
He
hear
the
voice
of
Father
Paul
say
to
him
:
"
wait
here
till
I
come
back
.
"
  
<EOS>
then
there
be
an
instant
of
silence
again
 
then
a
low
groaning
sound
that
seem
to
articulate
the
name
of
God
;
a
sound
unlike
his
father
's
voice
,
unlike
any
human
voice
he
have
ever
hear
 
and
then
the
noise
of
a
closing
door
.
<EOS>
He
look
up
,
and
see
that
he
be
stand
alone
before
the
cottage
.
  
<EOS>
once
,
after
an
interval
,
he
approach
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
He
just
see
through
it
the
hand
of
the
priest
hold
on
high
the
ivory
crucifix
;
but
stop
not
to
see
more
,
for
he
hear
such
word
,
such
sound
,
as
drive
him
back
to
his
former
place
.
<EOS>
there
he
stay
,
until
the
noise
of
something
fall
heavily
within
the
cottage
strike
on
his
ear
.
<EOS>
again
he
advance
toward
the
door
;
hear
Father
Paul
pray
;
listen
for
several
minute
;
then
hear
a
moan
voice
,
now
join
itself
to
the
voice
of
the
priest
,
now
choke
in
sobs
and
bitter
wailing
.
<EOS>
once
more
he
go
back
out
of
hearing
,
and
stir
not
again
from
his
place
.
<EOS>
He
wait
a
long
and
a
weary
time
there
 
so
long
that
one
of
the
scout
on
the
lookout
come
toward
him
,
evidently
suspicious
of
the
delay
in
the
priest
's
return
.
<EOS>
He
wave
the
man
back
,
and
then
look
again
toward
the
door
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
see
it
open
 
<EOS>
see
Father
Paul
approach
him
,
lead
Francois
Sarzeau
by
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
the
fisherman
never
raise
his
downcast
eye
to
his
son
's
face
;
tear
trickle
silently
over
his
cheek
;
he
follow
the
hand
that
lead
him
,
as
a
little
child
may
have
follow
it
,
listen
anxiously
and
humbly
at
the
priest
's
side
to
every
word
that
he
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gabriel
,
"
say
Father
Paul
,
in
a
voice
which
tremble
a
little
for
the
first
time
that
night
 
<EOS>
"
Gabriel
,
it
have
please
God
to
grant
the
perfect
fulfillment
of
the
purpose
which
bring
me
to
this
place
;
I
tell
you
this
,
as
all
that
you
need
 
as
all
,
I
believe
,
that
you
would
wish
 
to
know
of
what
have
pass
while
you
have
be
leave
wait
for
me
here
.
<EOS>
such
word
as
I
have
now
to
speak
to
you
be
speak
by
your
father
's
earnest
desire
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
own
wish
that
I
should
communicate
to
you
his
confession
of
have
secretly
follow
you
to
the
merchant
's
table
,
and
of
have
discover
(
as
you
discover
)
that
no
evidence
of
his
guilt
remain
there
.
<EOS>
this
admission
,
he
think
,
will
be
enough
to
account
for
his
conduct
toward
yourself
from
that
time
to
this
.
<EOS>
I
have
next
to
tell
you
(
also
at
your
father
's
desire
)
that
he
have
promise
in
my
presence
,
and
now
promise
again
in
yours
,
sincerity
of
repentance
in
this
manner
:
when
the
persecution
of
our
religion
have
cease
 
as
cease
it
will
,
and
that
speedily
,
be
assure
of
it
 
he
solemnly
pledge
himself
henceforth
to
devote
his
life
,
his
strength
and
what
worldly
possession
he
may
have
,
or
may
acquire
,
to
the
task
of
re
-
erect
and
restore
the
road
-
side
crosse
which
have
be
sacrilegiously
overthrow
and
destroy
in
his
native
province
,
and
to
do
good
,
go
where
he
may
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
say
all
that
be
require
of
me
,
and
may
bid
you
farewell
 
bear
with
me
the
happy
remembrance
that
I
have
leave
a
father
and
son
reconcile
and
restore
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
May
God
bless
and
prosper
you
,
and
those
dear
to
you

Gabriel

<EOS>
May
God
accept
your
father
's
repentance
,
and
bless
him
also
throughout
his
future
life

"
  
<EOS>
He
take
their
hand
,
press
them
long
and
warmly
,
then
turn
and
walk
quickly
down
the
path
which
lead
to
the
beach
.
<EOS>
Gabriel
dare
not
trust
himself
yet
to
speak
;
but
he
raise
his
arm
,
and
put
it
gently
round
his
father
's
neck
.
<EOS>
the
two
stand
together
so
,
look
out
dimly
through
the
tear
that
fill
their
eye
to
the
sea
.
<EOS>
They
see
the
boat
put
off
in
the
bright
track
of
the
moonlight
,
and
reach
the
vessel
's
side
;
they
watch
the
spreading
of
the
sail
,
and
follow
the
slow
course
of
the
ship
till
she
disappear
past
a
distant
headland
from
sight
.
  
<EOS>
after
that
,
they
go
into
the
cottage
together
.
<EOS>
They
know
it
not
then
,
but
they
have
see
the
last
,
in
this
world
,
of
Father
Paul
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
the
event

by
the
good
priest

sooner
even
than
he
have
anticipate

<EOS>
a
new
government

destiny
of
France

<EOS>
among
other
proposition

submit
to
the
Parliament
,
be
one
advocate
the
restoration
of
the
road
-
side
crosse
throughout
the
province
.
<EOS>
It
be
find
,
however
,
on
inquiry
,
that
these
crosse
be
to
be
count
by
thousand
,
and
that
the
mere
cost
of
wood
require
to
re
-
erect
them
necessitate
an
expenditure
of
money
which
the
bankrupt
nation
could
ill
afford
to
spare
.
<EOS>
while
this
project
be
under
discussion
,
and
before
it
be
finally
reject
,
one
man
have
undertake
the
task
which
the
Government
shrink
from
attempt
.
<EOS>
when
Gabriel
leave
the
cottage
,
take
his
brother
and
sister
to
live
with
his
wife

himself
at
the
farmhouse

perform
in
highway

byway
his
promise
to
Father
Paul

<EOS>
for
month
and
month

without
intermission
at
his
task
;
still

always

good

and
render
help
and
kindness
and
true
charity
to
any
whom
he
could
serve

<EOS>
He
walk
many
a
weary
mile

toil
through
many
a
hard
day
's
work
,
humble
himself
even
to
beg
of
other

to
get
wood
enough
to
restore
a
single
cross

<EOS>
no

ever
detect
him
in
falter
at
his
task

the
shelter

write

you
think

work
look
rather
long

state

will
occupy
twelve
volume

it
be
not
half
long
enough

even
then
,
for
the
subject

take
two
volume
(

it

examine
the
theory

ancient

take
two
more

a
breakfast

<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
that
he
be
right

and
that
I
be
prejudice

but
as
I
see
the
first
oily
,
vinegary
,
garlicky
morsel
slide
noiselessly
into
his
mouth

I
begin
to
feel
rather
sick

<EOS>
My

be
dirty
with
move
the

I
ask
if
I
could
wash
them
before
begin
to
work
at
the
likeness
,
as
a
good
excuse
for
get
out
of

while

Tizzi
be
unctuously
dispose
of
his
simple
vegetable
meal

<EOS>
the
philosopher
look
a
little
astonished
at
my
request
,
as
if
the
washing
of
hand
at
irregular
time
and
season
offer
a
comparatively
new
subject
of
contemplation
to
him
;
but
he
ring
a
hand
-
bell
on
his
table
immediately
,
and
tell
the
old
servant
to
take
me
up
into
his
bedroom
.
  
<EOS>
the
interior
of
the
parlor
have
astonish
me
;
but
a
sight
of
the
bedroom
be
a
new
sensation
 
not
of
the
most
agreeable
kind
.
<EOS>
the
couch
on
which
the
philosopher
seek
repose
after
his
labor
be
a
truckle
-
bed
that
would
not
have
fetch
half
a
crown
at
a

<EOS>
on
one
side

dangle
from

may
have
hang
himself
about

who
have
never

moment
of

suicide

<EOS>
on
the
other
side
of
the
bed
stand
a
long
press
,
in
which
I
observe
hideous
colored
preparation
of
the
muscular
system
,
and
bottle
with
curious
,
twining

thread

like
substance
inside

last
,
but
by
no

least
remarkable
among
the
other
extraordinary
object
in

,
the

figure
of
a
large
unshaven
poodle
-
dog
,
stand
on
an

keep
perpetual
watch
over
a

black

round

<EOS>
I
have
start
,
on
enter
the
room
,
at
the
skeleton
,
and
I
start
once
more
at
the
dog

<EOS>
the
old
servant
notice
me
each
time
with
a
sardonic
grin
.
<EOS>
"
do
not

afraid

"
he
say
;
"
one
be
as
dead
as
the
other

"
<EOS>
with
these
word
,
he
leave
me
to
wash
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
find
little
more
than
a
pint
of
water
at
my
disposal
,
and
fail
altogether
to
discover
where
the
soap
be
keep
,
I
be
not
long
in
perform
my
ablution

<EOS>
before
leave
the
room
,
I
look
again
at
the
stuffed
poodle
.
<EOS>
on
the
board
to
which
he
be
fix
,
I
see
paint
in
fade
letter
the
word
"
Scarammuccia
,
"
evidently
the
comic
italian
name
to
which
he
have
answer
in
his
lifetime
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
other
inscription
;
but
I
make
up
my
mind
that
the
dog
must
have
be
the
Professor
's
pet
,
and
that
he
keep
the
animal
stuff
in
his
bedroom
as
a
remembrance
of
past
time
.
<EOS>
"
who
would
have
suspect
so
great
a
philosopher
of

so
much
heart

"
<EOS>
think
I
,
leave
the
bedroom
to
go
downstairs
again
.
  
<EOS>
the
Professor
have
do
his
breakfast
,
and
be
anxious
to
begin
the
sitting
;
so
I
take
out
my
chalk
and
paper
,
and
set
to
work
at
once
 
I
seat
on
one
pile
of
book
and
he
on
another

<EOS>
"

be
there
not

Mr.
Kerby
?
"
say
the
old
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
do
you
notice
a
very
interesting
and
perfect
arrangement
of
the
intestinal
ganglia
?
<EOS>
They
form
the
subject
of
an
important
chapter
in
my
great
work

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
you
will
think
me
very
ignorant

I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
really
do
not
know
the
intestinal
ganglia
when
I
see
them
.
<EOS>
the
object
I
notice
with
most
curiosity
in
your

be
something
more
on
a
level
with
my
own
small
capacity

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

and
what
be
that
?
"
ask
the
Professor

<EOS>
"
the

he

<EOS>
no

no

<EOS>
a
young
woman
's
favorite
,
sir
,
before
I
be
bear
;
and
a
very
remarkable
dog
,
too
.
<EOS>
the
vital
principle
in
that
poodle
,
Mr.
Kerby
,
must
have
be
singularly
intensify
.
<EOS>
He
live
to
a
fabulous
old
age
,
and
he
be
clever
enough
to
play
an
important
part
of
his
own
in
what
you
English
call
a
romance
of
real
Life
!
<EOS>
if
I
could
only
have
dissect
that
poodle
,
I
would
have
put
him
into
my
book
;
he
should
have
head
my

the
Vital

"
  
<EOS>
"
here
be
a

I

if
I
can
only
keep
his

up

He
should

<EOS>
Scarammuccia
should
have
take
his
place
among
the

that
prove
my
new
theory
;
but
unfortunately
he
die
before
I
be

<EOS>
His

give
him

stuff
,
as
you
see
upstairs

to
my

Mr.

I
have

beyond
the

of

,
that

die

hydrophobia
 
but

<EOS>
I
have
better
show
you
how
it

<EOS>

<EOS>
He
leave
his
seat
as
he
speak
.
<EOS>
in
another
minute
he
would
have
send
the
servant
to
fetch
the
"
preparation
,

and
I
should
have
lose
the
story
.
<EOS>
at
the
risk
of
his
take
offense

I
beg
him
not
to
move
just
then

unless
he
wish
me
to
spoil

<EOS>
this
alarm

fortunately
do
not
irritate
him

<EOS>
He
return
to
his

I
resume
the
subject
of
the
stuffed
poodle
,
ask
him
boldly
to
tell
me
the
story
with
which
the
dog
be
connect
.
<EOS>
the
demand
seem
to
impress
him
with
no
very
favorable
opinion
of
my
intellectual
taste
;
but
he
comply
with
it
,
and
relate
,
not
without
many
a
wearisome
digression
to
the
subject
of
his
great
work
,
the
narrative
which
I
propose
call
by
the
name
of
"
the
Yellow
Mask
.
"
<EOS>
after
the
slight
specimen
that
I
have
give
of
his
character
and
style
of
conversation
,
it
will
be
almost
unnecessary
for
me
to
premise
that
I
tell
this
story
as
I
have
tell
the
last
,
and
"
Sister
Rose
,
"
in
my
own
language
,
and
accord
to
my
own
plan
in
the
disposition
of
the
incident
 
add
nothing
,
of
course
,
to
the
fact
,
but
keep
them
within
the
limit
which
my
disposable
space
prescribe
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
may
perhaps
be
allow
to
add
in
this
place
,
that
I
have
not
yet
see
or
hear
of
my
portrait
in
an
engraved
state

<EOS>
Professor

in

through
the

for
an
announcement
of

on

possibly

<EOS>

<EOS>
about
a
century
ago
,
there
live
in
the
ancient
city
of
Pisa
a
famous
italian
milliner
,
who
,
by
way
of
vindicate
to
all
customer
her
familiarity
with
Paris
fashion
,
adopt
a
french

and
call
herself
the
Demoiselle
Grifoni

<EOS>
She

a

Rumor

such

but
the
invincible
Grifoni
rise
superior
to
it
almost
without

Fortune

Brigida
lay
her
finger

She

thin

her
head

Her
hair

feature
possess
the
definiteness

regularity

the
"

which
be
the
rare
of
all
womanly
charm

in

the
one
serious
defect

its
paleness

Her

She
come

the
moment

Her

after
an
instant

hesitation

she
turn

She

undecided

he
have
no
incorrigible
fault

a

way

speak

a
monstrous
wrong

<EOS>
whenever
I
think
of
him
I
think
of
an
injury
which
his
present
existence
perpetuate

if
I
do
speak
of
him
coldly

it
be
only
for
that
reason

<EOS>
Luca
look
away
quickly

absently

,
Fabio
would
never
deceive
me

I
would
die
here
at

to
her
quietly

so
much
spirit

to
himself

I
would
die

Nanina

in
a
voice

begin
to
falter
now

<EOS>
"
I
would
die
rather
than
doubt
him

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
ask
you
to
doubt
him
,

Father
Rocco
,
gently
;

I
will
believe
in
him
myself
as
firmly
as
you
do

let
us
suppose
,
my
child

that
you
have
learn
patiently
all
the
many
thing
of
which
you
be
now
ignorant
,
and
which
it
be
necessary
for
a
lady
to
know

let
us
suppose
that
Signor
Fabio
have
really
violate
all
the
law
that
govern
people
in
his
high
station

have
take
you
to
him
publicly
as
his
wife

You
would
be
happy
then

Nanina

would
he
?
<EOS>
He
have
no
father
or
mother
to
control
him

it
be
true
;

he
have
friend
 
many
friend
and
intimate
in
his
own
rank
 
proud
,
heartless
people
,
who
know
nothing
of
your
worth

goodness

who
,
hearing
of
your
low
birth
,
would
look
on
you
,

on
your
husband
too
,
my
child
,
with
contempt
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
your
patience
and
fortitude

<EOS>
think
how
bitter
it
would
be
for
him
to
bear
that
contempt
 
to
see
you
shun
by
proud
woman
,
and
carelessly
pity
or
patronize
by
insolent
man
.
<EOS>
yet
all
this
,

more
,
he
would
have
to
endure
,
or
else
to
quit
the
world
he
have
live
in
from
his
boyhood
 
the
world
he
be
bear
to

in

You
love
him

out
afresh

<EOS>
stop
!
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
what
you
want
to
know
directly
.
<EOS>
only
answer
me
another
question
or
two
first
.
<EOS>
have
you
hear
anything
about
her
health
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
should
I
hear
?
<EOS>
dressmaker
can
not
inquire
at
the
door
of
the
nobility
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
true
.
<EOS>
now
one
last
question
.
<EOS>
that
little
simpleton
,
Nanina
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
see
or
hear
anything
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
can
not
be
at
Pisa
,
or
she
would
have
call
at
our
place
for
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
I
need
not
have
ask
about
her
if
I
have
think
a
moment
beforehand
.
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
would
be
sure
to
keep
her
out
of
Fabio
's
sight
,
for
his
niece
's
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
,
he
really
love
that
"
thread
-
paper
of
a
girl
"
as
you
call
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
than
fifty
such
wife
as
he
have
get
now
!
<EOS>
I
be
in
the
studio
<EOS>
the
morning
he
be
tell
of
her
departure
from
Pisa
.
<EOS>
a
letter
be
privately
give
to
him
,
tell
him
that
the
girl
have
leave
the
place
out
of
a
feeling
of
honor
,
and
have
hide
herself
beyond
the
possibility
of
discovery
,
to
prevent
him
from
compromise
himself
with
all
his
friend
by
marry
her
.
<EOS>
naturally
enough
,
he
would
not
believe
that
this
be
her
own
doing
;
and
,
naturally
enough
also
,
when
Father
Rocco
be
send
for
,
and
be
not
to
be
find
,
he
suspect
the
priest
of
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
business
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
a
man
in
such
a
fury
of
despair
and
rage
before
.
<EOS>
He
swear
that
he
would
have
all
Italy
search
for
the
girl
,
that
he
would
be
the
death
of
the
priest
,
and
that
he
would
never
enter
Luca
Lomi
's
studio
again
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
,
as
to
this
last
particular
,
of
course
,
be
a
man
,
he
fail
to
keep
his
word
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
of
course
.
<EOS>
at
that
first
visit
of
mine
to
the
studio
I
discover
two
thing
.
<EOS>
the
first
,
as
I
say
,
that
Fabio
be
really
in
love
with
the
girl
 
<EOS>
the
second
,
that
Maddalena
Lomi
be
really
in
love
with
him
.
<EOS>
You
may
suppose
I
look
at
her
attentively
while
the
disturbance
be
go
on
,
and
while
nobody
's
notice
be
direct
on
me
.
<EOS>
all
woman
be
vain
,
I
know
,
but
vanity
never
blind
my
eye
.
<EOS>
I
see
directly
that
I
have
but
one
superiority
over
her
 
my
figure
.
<EOS>
She
be
my
height
,
but
not
well
make
.
<EOS>
She
have
hair
as
dark
and
as
glossy
as
mine
;
eye
as
bright
and
as
black
as
mine
;
and
the
rest
of
her
face
better
than
mine
.
<EOS>
My
nose
be
coarse
,
my
lip
be
too
thick
,
and
my
upper
lip
overhang
my
under
too
far
.
<EOS>
She
have
none
of
those
personal
fault
;
and
,
as
for
capacity
,
she
manage
the
young
fool
in
his
passion
as
well
as
I
could
have
manage
him
in
her
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
stand
silent
,
with
downcast
eye
and
a
distressed
look
,
all
the
time
he
be
rave
up
and
down
the
studio
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
hate
the
girl
,
and
be
rejoice
at
her
disappearance
;
but
she
never
show
it
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
be
an
awkward
rival
"
<EOS>
(
I
think
to
myself
)
,
"
even
to
a
handsome
woman
than
I
be
.
"
<EOS>
however
,
I
determine
not
to
despair
too
soon
,
and
make
up
my
mind
to
follow
my
plan
just
as
if
the
accident
of
the
girl
's
disappearance
have
never
occur
.
<EOS>
I
smooth
down
the
master
-
sculptor
easily
enough
 
<EOS>
flatter
him
about
his
reputation
,
assure
him
that
the
work
of
Luca
Lomi
have
be
the
object
of
my
adoration
since
childhood
,
tell
him
that
I
have
hear
of
his
difficulty
in
find
a
model
to
complete
his
Minerva
from
,
and
offer
myself
(
if
he
think
me
worthy
)
for
the
honor
 
lay
great
stress
on
that
word
 
for
the
honor
of
sit
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
he
be
altogether
deceive
by
what
I
tell
him
;
but
he
be
sharp
enough
to
see
that
I
really
could
be
of
use
,
and
he
accept
my
offer
with
a
profusion
of
compliment
.
<EOS>
We
part
,
have
arrange
that
I
be
to
give
him
a
first
sit
in
a
week
's
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
put
it
off
so
long
?
"
  
"
to
allow
our
young
gentleman
time
to
cool
down
and
return
to
the
studio
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of
my
be
there
while
he
be
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
 
I
forget
.
<EOS>
and
how
long
be
it
before
he
come
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
allow
him
more
time
than
enough
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
give
my
first
sit
I
see
him
in
the
studio
,
and
hear
it
be
his
second
visit
there
since
the
day
of
the
girl
's
disappearance
.
<EOS>
those
very
violent
man
be
always
changeable
and
irresolute
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
have
he
make
no
attempt
,
then
,
to
discover
Nanina
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
!
<EOS>
He
have
search
for
her
himself
,
and
have
set
other
search
for
her
,
but
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
four
day
of
perpetual
disappointment
have
be
enough
to
bring
him
to
his
sense
.
<EOS>
Luca
Lomi
have
write
him
a
peace
-
make
letter
,
ask
what
harm
he
or
his
daughter
have
do
,
even
suppose
Father
Rocco
be
to
blame
.
<EOS>
Maddalena
Lomi
have
meet
him
in
the
street
,
and
have
look
resignedly
away
from
him
,
as
if
she
expect
him
to
pass
her
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
they
have
awaken
his
sense
of
justice
and
his
good
nature
(
you
see
,
I
can
impartially
give
him
his
due
)
,
and
they
have
get
him
back
.
<EOS>
He
be
silent
and
sentimental
enough
at
first
,
and
shockingly
sulky
and
savage
with
the
priest
"
  
"
I
wonder
Father
Rocco
venture
within
his
reach
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Father
Rocco
be
not
a
man
to
be
daunt
or
defeat
by
anybody
,
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
the
same
day
on
which
Fabio
come
back
to
the
studio
,
he
return
to
it
.
<EOS>
beyond
boldly
declare
that
he
think
Nanina
have
do
quite
right
,
and
have
act
like
a
good
and
virtuous
girl
,
he
would
say
nothing
about
her
or
her
disappearance
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
useless
to
ask
him
question
 
he
deny
that
any
one
have
a
right
to
put
them
.
<EOS>
threaten
,
entreating
,
flattering
 
<EOS>
all
mode
of
appeal
be
throw
away
on
him
.
<EOS>
ah
,
my
dear
!
depend
upon
it
,
the
clever
and
politest
man
in
Pisa
,
the
most
dangerous
to
an
enemy
and
the
most
delightful
to
a
friend
,
be
Father
Rocco
.
<EOS>
the
rest
of
them
,
when
I
begin
to
play
my
card
a
little
too
openly
,
behave
with
brutal
rudeness
to
me
.
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
,
from
first
to
last
,
treat
me
like
a
lady
.
<EOS>
sincere
or
not
,
I
do
not
care
 
<EOS>
he
treat
me
like
a
lady
when
the
other
treat
me
like
"
  
"
there
!
<EOS>
there
!
<EOS>
do
not
get
hot
about
it
now
.
<EOS>
tell
me
instead
how
you
make
your
first
approach
to
the
young
gentleman
whom
you
talk
of
so
contemptuously
as
Fabio
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
it
turn
out
,
in
the
bad
possible
way
.
<EOS>
first
,
of
course
,
I
make
sure
of
interesting
him
in
me
by
tell
him
that
I
have
know
Nanina
.
<EOS>
so
far
it
be
all
well
enough
.
<EOS>
My
next
object
be
to
persuade
him
that
she
could
never
have
go
away
if
she
have
truly
love
him
alone
;
and
that
he
must
have
have
some
fortunate
rival
in
her
own
rank
of
life
,
to
whom
she
have
sacrifice
him
,
after
gratify
her
vanity
for
a
time
by
bring
a
young
nobleman
to
her
foot
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
as
you
will
easily
imagine
,
difficulty
enough
in
make
him
take
this
view
of
Nanina
's
flight
.
<EOS>
His
pride
and
his
love
for
the
girl
be
both
concerned
in
refuse
to
admit
the
truth
of
my
suggestion
.
<EOS>
at
last
I
succeed
.
<EOS>
I
bring
him
to
that
state
of
ruffle
vanity
and
fretful
self
-
assertion
in
which
it
be
easy
to
work
on
a
man
's
feeling
 
in
which
a
man
's
own
wounded
pride
make
the
good
pitfall
to
catch
him
in
.
<EOS>
I
bring
him
,
I
say
,
to
that
state
,
and
then
she
step
in
and
profit
by
what
I
have
do
.
<EOS>
be
it
wonderful
now
that
I
rejoice
in
her
disappointment
 
that
I
should
be
glad
to
hear
any
ill
thing
of
her
that
any
one
could
tell
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
how
do
she
first
get
the
advantage
of
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
have
find
out
,
she
would
never
have
succeed
where
I
fail
.
<EOS>
all
I
know
be
,
that
she
have
more
opportunity
of
see
him
than
I
,
and
that
she
use
them
cunningly
enough
even
to
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
while
I
think
I
be
gain
ground
with
Fabio
,
I
be
actually
lose
it
.
<EOS>
My
first
suspicion
be
excite
by
a
change
in
Luca
Lomi
's
conduct
toward
me
.
<EOS>
He
grow
cold
,
neglectful
 
at
last
absolutely
rude
.
<EOS>
I
be
resolve
not
to
see
this
;
but
accident
soon
oblige
me
to
open
my
eye
.
<EOS>
one
morning
I
hear
Fabio
and
Maddalena
talk
of
me
when
they
imagine
I
have
leave
the
studio
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
repeat
their
word
,
especially
here
.
<EOS>
the
blood
fly
into
my
head
,
and
the
cold
catch
me
at
the
heart
,
when
I
only
think
of
them
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
enough
if
I
tell
you
that
he
laugh
at
me
,
and
that
she
"
  
"
Hush
!
<EOS>
not
so
loud
.
<EOS>
there
be
other
people
lodge
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
never
mind
about
tell
me
what
you
hear
;
it
only
irritate
you
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
can
guess
that
they
have
discover
"
  
"
<EOS>
through
her
 
remember
,
all
through
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
yes
,
I
understand
.
<EOS>
They
have
discover
a
great
deal
more
than
you
ever
intend
them
to
know
,
and
all
through
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
for
the
priest
,
Virginie
,
I
should
have
be
openly
insult
and
drive
from
their
door
.
<EOS>
He
have
insist
on
their
behaving
with
decent
civility
toward
me
.
<EOS>
They
say
that
he
be
afraid
of
me
,
and
laugh
at
the
notion
of
his
try
to
make
them
afraid
too
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
last
thing
I
hear
.
<EOS>
the
fury
I
be
in
,
and
the
necessity
of
keep
it
down
,
almost
suffocate
me
.
<EOS>
I
turn
round
to
leave
the
place
forever
,
when
,
who
should
I
see
,
stand
close
behind
me
,
but
Father
Rocco
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
discover
in
my
face
that
I
know
all
,
but
he
take
no
notice
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
only
ask
,
in
his
usual
quiet
,
polite
way
,
if
I
be
look
for
anything
I
have
lose
,
and
if
he
could
help
me
.
<EOS>
I
manage
to
thank
him
,
and
to
get
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
open
it
for
me
respectfully
,
and
bow
 
he
treat
me
like
a
lady
to
the
last
!
<EOS>
It
be
evening
when
I
leave
the
studio
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
the
next
morning
I
throw
up
my
situation
,
and
turn
my
back
on
Pisa
.
<EOS>
now
you
know
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
hear
of
the
marriage
?
<EOS>
or
do
you
only
assume
from
what
you
know
that
it
would
take
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
of
it
about
six
month
ago
.
<EOS>

man
come
to
sing
in
the
chorus
at
our
theater
who
have
be
employ
some
time
before

the
grand
concert

on
the
occasion
of
the
marriage

but
let
us
drop
the
subject
now
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
a
fever
already
with
talk
of
it
.
<EOS>
You
be
in
a
bad
situation
here
,
my
dear
;
I
declare
your
room
be
almost
stifling

Shall
I
open
the
other
window
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;

us
go
out
and
get
a
breath
of
air
by
the
river

side

your
hood
and
fan

dark
 
nobody
will
see
us

can
come
back
here

if
you
like

in
half
an
hour

"
  
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
Virginie
accede
to
her
friend
's
wish
rather
reluctantly

They
walk
toward
the
river
.
<EOS>
the
sun
be
down
,
and
the
sudden
night
of
Italy
be
gather
fast
.

although
Brigida
do
not
say
another
word
on
the
subject
of
Fabio
or
his
wife
,
she
lead
the
way
to
the
bank
of
the
Arno

on
which
the
young
nobleman

have
declare
themselves

that
he
have
throw
it
aside

after

the
address

<EOS>
in

His

<EOS>
those
superstitious
feeling
which

before
read
the
letter

its
arrival
ominous
of
good

evil

<EOS>
that
be
the
thought
in

may
have
tell
it

I
have
never

I
could
not
prevail
on
myself
to
get
other

take
the
pen

<EOS>
all
I
could
do
be
to
learn
secretly
how
to
write
with
my

It

long
work

the
uppermost

me
patient

at

yes

be
just
possible

at

at

I
think
,
now
,
that
I
do
wrong
to
distrust
her

it
be
of
the
last
importance
to
provide
against

possibility

to
abstain
from
put
too
much
faith
in
my
own
good
opinion
of
the
girl

for
these
reason

I
certainly
do
instruct
you

you

sensation
as

He

still
the

PART

<EOS>
CHAPTER
I.
  
about
eight
month
after
the
Countess
d'Ascoli
have
be
lay
in
her
grave
in
the
Campo
Santo
<EOS>
,
two
report
be
circulate
through
the
gay
world
of
Pisa
,
which
excite
curiosity
and
awakened
expectation
everywhere
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
report
announce
that
a
grand
mask
ball
be
to
be
give
at
the
Melani
Palace
,
to
celebrate
the
day
on
which
the
heir
of
the
house
attain
his
majority
.
<EOS>
all
the
friend
of
the
family
be
delight
at
the
prospect
of
this
festival
;
for
the
old
Marquis
Melani
have
the
reputation
of
be
one
of
the
most
hospitable
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
one
of
the
most
eccentric
man
in
Pisa
.
<EOS>
every
one
expect
,
therefore
,
that
he
would
secure
for
the
entertainment
of
his
guest
,
if
he
really
give
the
ball
,
the
most
whimsical
novelty
in
the
way
of
mask
,
dance
,
and
amusement
generally
,
that
have
ever
be
see
.
  
<EOS>
the
second
report
be
,
that
the
rich
widower
,
Fabio
d'Ascoli
,
be
on
the
point
of
return
to
Pisa
,
after
have
improve
his
health
and
spirit
by
travel
in
foreign
country
;
and
that
he
may
be
expect
to
appear
again
in
society
,
for
the
first
time
since
the
death
of
his
wife
,
at
the
mask
ball
which
be
to
be
give
in
the
Melani
Palace
.
<EOS>
this
announcement
excite
special
interest
among
the
young
lady
of
Pisa
.
<EOS>
Fabio
have
only
reach
his
thirtieth
year
;
and
it
be
universally
agree
that
his
return
to
society
in
his
native
city
could
indicate
nothing
more
certainly
than
his
desire
to
find
a
second
mother
for
his
infant
child
.
<EOS>
all
the
single
lady
would
now
have
be
ready
to
bet
,
as
confidently
as
Brigida
have
offer
to
bet
eight
month
before
,
that
Fabio
d'Ascoli
would
marry
again
.
  
<EOS>
for
once
in
a
way
,
report
turn
out
to
be
true
,
in
both
the
case
just
mention
.
<EOS>
invitation
be
actually
issue
from
the
Melani
Palace
,
and
Fabio
return
from
abroad
to
his
home
on
the
Arno
.
  
<EOS>
in
settle
all
the
arrangement
connect
with
his
mask
ball
,
the
Marquis
Melani
show
that
he
be
determine
not
only
to
deserve
,
but
to
increase
,
his
reputation
for
oddity
.
<EOS>
He
invent
the
most
extravagant
disguise
,
to
be
wear
by
some
of
his
more
intimate
friend
;
he
arrange
grotesque
dance
,
to
be
perform
at
state
period
of
the
evening
by
professional
buffoon
,
hire
from
Florence
.
<EOS>
He
compose
a
toy
symphony
,
which
include
solo
on
every
noisy
plaything
at
that
time
manufacture
for
child
's
use
.
<EOS>
and
not
content
with
thus
avoid
the
beaten
track
in
prepare
the
entertainment
at
the
ball
,
he
determine
also
to
show
decide
originality
,
even
in
select
the
attendant
who
be
to
wait
on
the
company
.
<EOS>
other
people
in
his
rank
of
life
be
accustomed
to
employ
their
own
and
hire
footman
for
this
purpose
;
the
marquis
resolve
that
his
attendant
should
be
compose
of
young
woman
only
;
that
two
of
his
room
should
be
fit
up
as
arcadian
bower
;
and
that
all
the
pretty
girl
in
Pisa
should
be
place
in
them
to
preside
over
the
refreshment
,
dress
,
in
accordance
with
the
mock
classical
taste
of
the
period
,
as
shepherdess
of
the
time
of
Virgil
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
defect
of
this
brilliantly
new
idea
be
the
difficulty
of
execute
it
.
<EOS>
the
marquis
have
expressly
order
that
not
few
than
thirty
shepherdess
be
to
be
engage
 
fifteen
for
each
bower
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
easy
to
find
double
this
number
in
Pisa
,
if
beauty
have
be
the
only
quality
require
in
the
attendant
damsel
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
also
absolutely
necessary
,
for
the
security
of
the
marquis
's
gold
and
silver
plate
,
that
the
shepherdess
should
possess
,
besides
good
look
,
the
very
homely
recommendation
of
a
fair
character
.
<EOS>
this
last
qualification
prove
,
it
be
sad
to
say
,
to
be
the
one
small
merit
which
the
majority
of
the
lady
willing
to
accept
engagement
at
the
palace
do
not
possess
.
<EOS>
day
after
day
pass
on
;
and
the
marquis
's
steward
only
find
more
and
more
difficulty
in
obtain
the
appoint
number
of
trustworthy
beauty
.
<EOS>
at
last
his
resource
fail
him
altogether
;
and
he
appear
in
his
master
's
presence
about
a
week
before
the
night
of
the
ball
,
to
make
the
humiliating
acknowledgment
that
he
be
entirely
at
his
wit
'
end
.
<EOS>
the
total
number
of
fair
shepherdess
with
fair
character
whom
he
have
be
able
to
engage
amount
only
to
twenty
-
three
.
  
<EOS>
"
nonsense
!
"
cry
the
marquis
,
irritably
,
as
soon
as
the
steward
have
make
his
confession
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
to
get
thirty
girl
,
and
thirty
I
mean
to
have
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
use
of
shake
your
head
when
all
their
dress
be
order
?
<EOS>
thirty
tunic
,
thirty
wreath
,
thirty
pair
of
sandal
and
silk
stocking
,
thirty
crook
,
you
scoundrel
 
<EOS>
and
you
have
the
impudence
to
offer
me
only
twenty
-
three
hand
to
hold
them
.
<EOS>
not
a
word
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
hear
a
word
!
<EOS>
get
me
my
thirty
girl
,
or
lose
your
place
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
marquis
roar
out
this
last
terrible
sentence
at
the
top
of
his
voice
,
and
point
peremptorily
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
the
steward
know
his
master
too
well
to
remonstrate
.
<EOS>
He
take
his
hat
and
cane
,
and
go
out
.
<EOS>
It
be
useless
to
look
through
the
rank
of
reject
volunteer
again
;
there
be
not
the
slight
hope
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
the
only
chance
leave
be
to
call
on
all
his
friend
in
Pisa
who
have
daughter
out
at
service
,
and
to
try
what
he
could
accomplish
,
by
bribery
and
persuasion
,
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
whole
day
occupy
in
solicitation
,
promise
,
and
patient
smooth
down
of
innumerable
difficulty
,
the
result
of
his
effort
in
the
new
direction
be
an
accession
of
six
more
shepherdess
.
<EOS>
this
bring
him
on
bravely
from
twenty
-
three
to
twenty
-
nine
,
and
leave
him
,
at
last
,
with
only
one
anxiety
 
<EOS>
where
be
he
now
to
find
shepherdess
number
thirty
?
  
<EOS>
He
mentally
ask
himself
that
important
question
,
as
he
enter
a
shady
by
-
street
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
Campo
Santo
,
on
his
way
back
to
the
Melani
Palace
.
<EOS>
saunter
slowly
along
in
the
middle
of
the
road
,
and
fan
himself
with
his
handkerchief
after
the
oppressive
exertion
of
the
day
,
he
pass
a
young
girl
who
be
stand
at
the
street
door
of
one
of
the
house
,
apparently
wait
for
somebody
to
join
her
before
she
enter
the
building
.
  
<EOS>
"
Body
of
Bacchus
!
"
exclaim
the
steward
(
use
one
of
those
old
Pagan
ejaculation
which
survive
in
Italy
even
to
the
present
day
)
,
"
there
stand
the
pretty
girl
I
have
see
yet
.
<EOS>
if
she
would
only
be
shepherdess
number
thirty
,
I
should
go
home
to
supper
with
my
mind
at
ease
.
<EOS>
I
will
ask
her
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
nothing
can
be
lose
by
ask
,
and
everything
may
be
gain
.
<EOS>
stop
,
my
dear
,
"
he
continue
,
see
the
girl
turn
to
go
into
the
house
as
he
approach
her
.
"
<EOS>
do
not
be
afraid
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
steward
to
the
Marquis
Melani
,
and
well
know
in
Pisa
as
an
eminently
respectable
man
.
<EOS>
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
which
may
be
greatly
for
your
benefit
.
<EOS>
do
not
look
surprised

the
point
at
once

<EOS>
do

want
to
earn
a
little

<EOS>
honestly
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
look
as

you
be
very
rich

child

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
poor
,
and
very
much
in
want
of
some
honest
work
to
do
,
"
answer
the
girl
,
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
"
then

must
have
hear
of

pompously

hear

It
be
the
talk

<EOS>
still
Nanina
make
no
answer

<EOS>
to
have
reply
truthfully
,
she
must
have
confess
that
"
the
talk
of
the
whole

have
now
no
interest
for
her
.
<EOS>
the
last
news
from
Pisa
that
have
appeal
to
her
sympathy
be
the
news
of
the
Countess
d'Ascoli
's
death
,
and
of
Fabio
's
departure
to
travel
in
foreign
country
.
<EOS>
since
then
she
have
hear
nothing
more
of
him
.
<EOS>
She
be
as
ignorant
of
his
return
to
his
native
city
as
of
all
the
report
connect
with
the
marquis
's
ball
.
<EOS>
something
in
her
own
heart
 
<EOS>
some
feeling
which
she
have
neither
the
desire
nor
the
capacity
to
analyze
 
have
bring
her
back
to
Pisa
and
to
the
old
home
which
now
connect
itself
with
her
tender
recollection
.
<EOS>
believe
that
Fabio
be
still
absent
,
she
feel
that
no
ill
motive
could
now
be
attribute
to
her
return
;
and
she
have
not
be
able
to
resist
the
temptation
of
revisit
the
scene
that
have
be
associate
with
the
first
great
happiness
as
well
as
with
the
first
great
sorrow
of
her
life

<EOS>
among
all
the
poor
people
of
Pisa
,
she
be
perhaps
the
very
last
whose
curiosity
could
be
awaken
,
or
whose
attention
could
be
attract
by
the
rumor
of
gayetie
at
the
Melani
Palace
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
could
not
confess
all
this
;
she
could
only
listen
with
great
humility
and
no
small
surprise
,
while
the
steward
,
in
compassion
for
her
ignorance
,
and
with
the
hope
of
tempt
her
into
accept
his
offer
engagement
,
describe
the
arrangement
of
the
approach
festival
,
and
dwelt
fondly
on
the
magnificence
of
the
arcadian
bower
,

the
beauty
of
the
shepherdess

tunic
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
have
do
,
Nanina
venture
on
the
confession
that
she
should
feel
rather
nervous
in
a
grand
dress
that
do
not
belong
to
her
,
and
that
she
doubt
very
much
her
own
capability
of
wait
properly
on
the
great
people
at
the
ball
.
<EOS>
the
steward
,
however
,
would
hear
of
no
objection

call
peremptorily
for
Marta
Angrisani
to
make
the
necessary
statement
as
to
Nanina

regularity
and
discipline
of
his
daily
habit
;
and
vigilant
Scandal
,
though
she
seek
often
to
surprise
him
,
seek
always
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
Father
Rocco
's
life
from
the
period
of
his
niece
's
death
to
Fabio
's
return
to
Pisa
.
  
<EOS>
as
a
matter
of
course
,
the
priest
be
one
of
the
first
to
call
at
the
palace
and
welcome
the
young
nobleman
back
.
<EOS>
what
pass
between
them
at
this
interview
never
be
precisely
know
;
but
it
be
surmise
readily
enough
that
some
misunderstanding
have
take
place
,
for
Father
Rocco
do
not
repeat
his
visit
.
<EOS>
He
make
no
complaint
of
Fabio
,
but
simply
state
that
he
have
say
something
,
intend
for
the
young
man
's
good
,
which
have
not
be
receive
in
a
right
spirit
;
and
that
he
think
it
desirable
to
avoid
the
painful
chance
of
any
further
collision
by
not
present
himself
at
the
palace
again
for
some
little
time
.
<EOS>
People
be
rather
amazed
at
this
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
be
still
more
surprised
if
the
subject
of
the
mask
ball
have
not
just
then
occupy
all
their
attention
,
and
prevent
their
noticing
it
,
by
another
strange
event
in
connection
with
the
priest
.
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
,
some
week
after
the
cessation
of
his
intercourse
with
Fabio
,
return
one
morning
to
his
old
way
of
life
as
a
sculptor
,
and
open
the
long
-
close
door
of
his
brother

studio
.
  
<EOS>
Luca

<EOS>
visitor

at
the
studio
,
but
be
always
send
away
again
by
the
disappointing
announcement
that
there
be
nothing
new
to
show
them
.
<EOS>
so
the
day
pass
on
until
Nanina
leave
her
situation
and
return
to
Pisa
.
<EOS>
this
circumstance
be
duly
report
to
Father
Rocco
by
his
correspondent
at
Florence
;
but
,
whether
he
be
too
much
occupy
among
the
statue
,
or
whether
it
be
one
result
of
his
cautious
resolution
never
to
expose
himself
unnecessarily
to
so
much
as
the
breath
of
detraction
,
he
make
no
attempt
to
see
Nanina
,
or
even
to
justify
himself
toward
her
by
write
her
a
letter
.
<EOS>
all
his
morning
continue
to
be
spend
alone
in
the
studio
,
and
all
his
afternoon
to
be
occupy
by
his
clerical
duty
,
until
the
day
before
the
mask
ball
at
the
Melani

.
  
<EOS>
early
on
that
day
he
cover
over
the
statue
,
and
lock
the
door
of
the
work
-
room
once
more
;
then
return
to
his
own
lodging
,
and
do
not
go
out
again
.
<EOS>
one
or
two
of
his
friend
who
want
to
see
him
be
inform
that
he
be
not
well
enough
to
be
able
to
receive
them
.
<EOS>
if
they
have
penetrate
into
his
little
study
,
and
have
see
him
,
they
would
have
be
easily
satisfied
that
this
be
no
mere
excuse
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
notice
that
his
face
be
startlingly
pale
,
and
that
the
ordinary
composure
of
his
manner
be
singularly
disturb
.
  
<EOS>
toward
evening
this
restlessness
increase
,
and
his
old
housekeeper
,
on
press
him
to
take
some
nourishment
,
be
astonish
to
hear
him
answer
her
sharply
and
irritably
,
for
the
first
time
since
she
have
be
in
his
service
.
<EOS>
a
little
later
her
surprise
be
increase
by
his
send
her
with
a
note
to
the
Ascoli
Palace
,
and
by
the
quick
return
of
an
answer
,
bring
ceremoniously
by
one
of
Fabio
's
servant
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
long
since

<EOS>
be

<EOS>
"
think
the
housekeeper
as
she

answer
upstairs
to
her
master

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
if

then
return
,
and
try
the
lock
of
his

that

then

<EOS>
He

irritably
backward
and

,
and
a
plain
black
domino
dress
for
the
masquerade
of
the

on
one
of

<EOS>
"

,
abruptly
,
"

this
delay

unshaken

,
at

he
linger

linger
on

without

some
strange
influence
seem
to
be

him
within

wall
of
his
lonely
home

<EOS>
It
be
as
if
the

empty

silent
palace
have
almost
recover
on
that
night
the
charm
which
it
have
lose

He
leave
his
own
apartment
and
go
to
the
bedroom
where
his
infant
child
lie
asleep
in
her
little
crib

He
sit
watch

quietly

tenderly
of
many
past

a

loneliness
come
upon

bedside

do
not

from

connect
itself
inexplicably
with
the
remembrance

He
read
it
through
slowly
,
and
when
he
have
do
,
keep
it
open
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
youth
,
title
,
wealth
,
"
he
think
to
himself
,
sadly
;
"
everything
that
be

after
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
and
yet
if
I
try
to
think
of
any
human
being
who
really
and
truly
love
me
,
I
can
remember
but
one
 
the
poor
,
faithful
girl
who
write
these

"
  
<EOS>
old
recollection
of
the
first
day
when
he
meet
with
Nanina
,
of
the
first
sit
she
have
give
him
in
Luca
Lomi
's
studio
,
of
the
first
visit
to
the
neat
little
room
in
the
by
-
street
,
begin
to
rise
more
and
more
vividly
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
entirely
absorb
by
them
,
he
sit
absently
draw
with
pen
and
ink
,
on
some
sheet
of
letter
-
paper
lying
under
his
hand
,
line
and
circle
,
and
fragment
of
decoration
,
and
vague
remembrance
of
old
idea
for
statue
,
until
the
sudden
sinking
of
the
flame
of
his
lamp
awake
his
attention
abruptly
to
present
thing
.
  
<EOS>
He
look
at
his
watch
.
<EOS>
It
be
close
on
midnight
.
  
<EOS>
this
discovery
at
last
arouse
him
to
the
necessity
of
immediate
departure
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
he
have
put
on
his
domino
and
mask
,
and
be
on
his
way
to
the
ball
.
  
<EOS>
before
he
reach
the
Melani
Palace
the
first
part
of
the
entertainment
have
come
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
the
"
Toy
Symphony
"
have
be
play
,
the
grotesque
dance
perform
,
amid
universal
laughter
;
and
now
the
guest
be
,
for
the
most
part
,
fortify
themselves
in
the
arcadian
bower
for
new
dance
,
in
which
all
person
present
be
expect
to
take
part
.
<EOS>
the
Marquis
Melani
have
,
with
characteristic
oddity
,
divide
his
two
classical
refreshment
-
room
into
what
he
term
the
Light
and
Heavy
Departments
.
<EOS>
fruit
,
pastry
,
sweetmeat
,
salad
,
and
harmless
drink
be
include
under
the
first
head
,
and
all
the
stimulate
liquor
and
solid
eatable
under
the
last
.
<EOS>
the
thirty
shepherdess
have
be
,
accord
to
the
marquis
's
order
,
equally
divide
at
the
outset
of
the
evening
between
the
two
room
.
<EOS>
but
as
the
company
begin
to
crowd
more
and
more
resolutely
in
the
direction
of
the
Heavy
Department
,
ten
of
the
shepherdess
attach
to
the
Light
Department
be
tell
off
to
assist
in
attend
on
the
hungry
and
thirsty
majority
of
guest
who
be
not
to
be
appease
by
pastry
and
lemonade
.
<EOS>
among
the
five
girl
who
be
leave
behind
in
the
room
for
the
light
refreshment
be
Nanina
.
<EOS>
the
steward
soon
discover
that
the
novelty
of
her
situation
make
her
really
nervous
,
and
he
wisely
conclude
that
if
he
trust
her
where
the
crowd
be
great
and
the
noise
loudest
,
she
would
not
only
be
utterly
useless
,
but
also
very
much
in
the
way
of
her
more
confident
and
experienced
companion
.
  
<EOS>
when
Fabio
arrive
at
the
palace
,
the
jovial
uproar
in
the
Heavy
Department
be
at
its
height
,
and
several
gentleman
,
fire
by
the
classical
costume
of
the
shepherdess
,
be
begin
to
speak
Latin
to
them
with
a
thick
utterance
,
and
a
valorous
contempt
for
all
restriction
of
gender
,
number
,
and
case
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
could
escape
from
the
congratulation
on
his
return
to
his
friend
,
which
pour
on
him
from
all
side
,
Fabio
withdraw
to
seek
some
quieter
room
.
<EOS>
the
heat
,
noise
,
and
confusion
have
so
bewilder
him
,
after
the
tranquil
life
he
have
be
lead
for
many
month
past
,
that
it
 
be
quite
a
relief
to
stroll
through
the
half
desert
dancing
-
room
,
to
the
opposite
extremity
of
the
great
suite
of
apartment
,
and
there
to
find
himself
in
a
second
arcadian
bower
,
which
seem
peaceful
enough
to
deserve
its
name
.
  
<EOS>
a
few
guest
be
in
this
room
when
he
first
enter
it
,
but
the
distant
sound
of
some
first
note
of
dance
music
draw
them
all
away
.
<EOS>
after
a
careless
look
at
the
quaint
decoration
about
him
,
he
sit
down
alone
on
a
divan
near
the
door
,
and
begin
already
to
feel
the
heat
and
discomfort
of
his
mask
,
take
it
off
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
remove
it
more
than
a
moment
before
he
hear
a
faint
cry
in
the
direction
of
a
long
refreshment
-
table
,
behind
which
the
five
wait
-
girl
be
stand
.
<EOS>
He
start
up
directly
,
and
could
hardly
believe
his
sense
,
when
he
find
himself
stand
face
to
face
with
Nanina
.
  
<EOS>
Her
cheek
have
turn
perfectly
colorless
.
<EOS>
Her
astonishment
at
see
the
young
nobleman
appear
to
have
some
sensation
of
terror
mingle
with
it
.
<EOS>
the
waiting
-
woman
who
happen
to
stand
by
her
side
instinctively
stretch
out
an
arm
to
support
her
,
observe
that
she
catch
at
the
edge
of
the
table
as
Fabio
hurry
round
to
get
behind
it
and
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
when
he
draw
near
,
her
head
droop
on
her
breast
,
and
she
say
,
faintly
:
"
I
never
know
you
be
at
Pisa
;
I
never
think
you
would
be
here
.
<EOS>
oh
,
I
be
true
to
what
I
say
in
my
letter
,
though
I
seem
so
false
to
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
about
the
letter
 
to
tell
you
how
carefully
I
have
keep
it
<EOS>
,
how
often
I
have
read
it
,
"
say
Fabio
.
  
<EOS>
She
turn
away
her
head
,
and
try
hard
to
repress
the
tear
that
would
force
their
way
into
her
eye
<EOS>
"
We
should
never
have
meet
,
"
she
say
;
"
never
,
never
have
meet
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
before
Fabio
could
reply
,
the
waiting
-
woman
by
Nanina
's
side
interpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
do
not
stop
speak
to
her
here
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
,
impatiently
.
"
<EOS>
if
the
steward
or
one
of
the
upper
servant
be
to
come
in
,
you
would
get
her
into
dreadful
trouble
.
<EOS>
wait
till
to
-
morrow
,
and
find
some
fitter
place
than
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fabio
feel
the
justice
of
the
reproof
immediately
.
<EOS>
He
tear
a
leaf
out
of
his
pocketbook
,
and
write
on
it
,
"
I
must
tell
you
how
I
honor
and
thank
you
for
that
letter
.
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
 
ten
o'clock
 
<EOS>
the
wicket
-
gate
at
the
back
of
the
ascoli
garden
.
<EOS>
believe
in
my
truth
and
honor
,
Nanina
,
for
I
believe
implicitly
in
yours
.
"
<EOS>
have
write
these
line
,
he
take
from
among
his
bunch
of
watch
-
seal
a
little
key
,
wrap
it
up
in
the
note
,
and
press
it
into
her
hand
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
himself
his
finger
linger
round
her
,
and
he
be
on
the
point
of
speak
to
her
again
,
when
he
see
the
waiting
-
woman
's
hand
,
which
be
just
raise
to
motion
him
away
,
suddenly
drop
.
<EOS>
Her
color
change
at
the
same
moment
,
and
she
look
fixedly
across
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
He
turn
round
immediately
,
and
see
a
masked
woman
stand
alone
in
the
room
,
dress
entirely
in
yellow
from
head
to
foot
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
yellow
hood
,
a
yellow
half
-
mask
with
deep
fringe
hang
down
over
her
mouth
,
and
a
yellow
domino
,
cut
at
the
sleeve
and
edge
into
long
flame
-
shape
point
,
which
wave
backward
and
forward
tremulously
in
the
light
air
waft
through
the
doorway
.
<EOS>
the
woman
's
black
eye
seem
to
gleam
with
an
evil
brightness
through
the
sight
-
hole
of
the
mask
,
and
the
tawny
fringe
hang
before
her
mouth
flutter
slowly
with
every
breath
she
draw
.
<EOS>
without
a
word
or
a
gesture
she
stand
before
the
table
,
and
her
gleam
black
eye
fix
steadily
on
Fabio
the
instant
he
confront
her
.
<EOS>
a
sudden
chill
strike
through
him
,
as
he
observe
that
the
yellow
of
the
stranger
's
domino
and
mask
be
of
precisely
the
same
shade
as
the
yellow
of
the
hanging
and
furniture
which
his
wife
have
choose
after
their
marriage
for
the
decoration
of
her
favorite
sitting
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
Yellow
Mask
!
"
whisper
the
waiting
-
girl
nervously
,
crowd
together
behind
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Yellow
Mask
again
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
make
her
speak
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
ask
her
to
have
something
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
gentleman
will
ask
her
.
<EOS>
speak
to
her
,
sir
.
<EOS>
do
speak
to
her
!
<EOS>
She
glide
about
in
that
fearful
yellow
dress
like
a
ghost
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fabio
look
around
mechanically
at
the
girl
who
be
whisper
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
see
at
the
same
time
that
Nanina
still
keep
her
head
turn
away
,
and
that
she
have
her
handkerchief
at
her
eye
.
<EOS>
She
be
evidently
struggle
yet
with
the
agitation
produce
by
their
unexpected
meeting
,
and
be
,
most
probably
for
that
reason
,
the
only
person
in
the
room
not
conscious
of
the
presence
of
the
Yellow
Mask
.
  
<EOS>
"
speak
to
her
,
sir
.
<EOS>
do
speak
to
her
!
"
<EOS>
whisper
two
of
the
waiting
-
girl
together
.
  
<EOS>
Fabio
turn
again
toward
the
table
.
<EOS>
the
black
eye
be
still
gleam
at
him
from
behind
the
tawny
yellow
of
the
mask
.
<EOS>
He
nod
to
the
girl
who
have
just
speak
,
cast
one
farewell
look
at
Nanina
,
and
move
down
the
room
to
get
round
to
the
side
of
the
table
at
which
the
Yellow
Mask
be
stand
.
<EOS>
step
by
step
as
he
move
the
bright
eye
follow
him
.
<EOS>
steadily
and
more
steadily
their
evil
light
seem
to
shine
through
and
through
him
,
as
he
turn
the
corner
of
the
table
and
approach
the
still
,
spectral
figure
.
  
<EOS>
He
come
close
up
to
the
woman
,
but
she
never
move
;
her
eye
never
waver
for
an
instant
.
<EOS>
He
stop
and
try
to
speak
;
but
the
chill
strike
through
him
again
.
<EOS>
an
overpowering
dread
,
an
unutterable
loathing
seize
on
him
;
all
sense
of
outer
thing
 
the
whispering
of
the
waiting
-
girl
behind
the
table
,
the
gentle
cadence
of
the
dance
music
,
the
distant
hum
of
joyous
talk
 
suddenly
leave
him
.
<EOS>
He
turn
away
shudder
,
and
quit
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
follow
the
sound
of
the
music
,
and
desire
before
all
thing
now
to
join
the
crowd
wherever
it
be
large
,
he
be
stop
in
one
of
the
small
apartment
by
a
gentleman
who
have
just
rise
from
the
card
table
,
and
who
hold
out
his
hand
with
the
cordiality
of
an
old
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
welcome
back
to
the
world
,
Count
Fabio
!
"
<EOS>
he
begin
,
gayly
,
then
suddenly
check
himself
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
look
pale
,
and
your
hand
feel
cold
.
<EOS>
not
ill
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
no
,
no
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
rather
startle
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
why
 
by
a
very
strangely
dress
woman
,
who
fairly
stare
me
out
of
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
mean
the
Yellow
Mask
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
I
do
.
<EOS>
have
you
see
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
everybody
have
see
her
;
but
nobody
can
make
her
unmask
,
or
get
her
to
speak
.
<EOS>
Our
host
have
not
the
slight
notion
who
she
be
;
and
our
hostess
be
horribly
frightened
at
her
.
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
think
she
have
give
us
quite
enough
of
her
mystery
and
her
grim
dress
;
and
if
my
name
,
instead
of
be
nothing
but
plain
Andrea
D'Arbino
,
be
Marquis
Melani
,
I
would
say
to
her
:
"
Madam
,
we
be
here
to
laugh
and
amuse
ourselves
;
suppose
you
open
your
lip
,
and
charm
us
by
appear
in
a
pretty
dress
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
during
this
conversation
they
have
sit
down
together
,
with
their
back
toward
the
door
,
by
the
side
of
one
of
the
card
-
table
.
<EOS>
while
D'Arbino
be
speak
,
Fabio
suddenly
feel
himself
shudder
again
,
and
become
conscious
of
a
sound
of
low
breathing
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
turn
round
instantly
,
and
there
,
stand
between
them
,
and
peer
down
at
them
,
be
the
Yellow
Mask
!
  
<EOS>
Fabio
start
up
,
and
his
friend
follow
his
example
.
<EOS>
again
the
gleam
black
eye
rest
steadily
on
the
young
nobleman
's
face
,
and
again
their
look
chill
him
to
the
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yellow
Lady
,
do
you
know
my
friend
?
"
<EOS>
exclaim
D'Arbino
,
with
mock
solemnity
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
answer
.
<EOS>
the
fatal
eye
never
move
from
Fabio
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yellow
Lady
,
"
continue
the
other
,
"
listen
to
the
music
.
<EOS>
Will
you
dance
with
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
eye
look
away
,
and
the
figure
glide
slowly
from
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
count
,
"
say
D'Arbino
,
"
that
woman
seem
to
have
quite
an
effect
on
you
.
<EOS>
I
declare
she
have
leave
you
paler
than
ever
.
<EOS>
come
into
the
supper
-
room
with
me
,
and
have
some
wine
;
you
really
look
as
if
you
want
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
go
at
once
to
the
large
refreshment
-
room
.
<EOS>
nearly
all
the
guest
have
by
this
time
begin
to
dance
again
.
<EOS>
They
have
the
whole
apartment
,
therefore
,
almost
entirely
to
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
among
the
decoration
of
the
room
,
which
be
not

in
accordance
with
genuine
arcadian
simplicity

large
looking

over
a
well

<EOS>
D'Arbino
lead
Fabio
in
this
direction
,
exchange
greeting
as
he
advance
with
a
gentleman
who
stand
near
the
glass
look
into
it
,
and
carelessly
fan
himself
with
his
mask
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
friend
!
"
<EOS>
cry
D'Arbino
,
"
you
be
the
very
man
to
lead
us
straight
to

good
bottle
of
wine
in

<EOS>
Count

me
present
to
you
<EOS>
my

the
Cavaliere
Finello

and
I
have

a
good
dose
of
wine

<EOS>
I

and
I

<EOS>
the

the
Cavaliere

a
particular
bottle
,
and
fill
them
.
<EOS>
all
three
gentleman
turn
round
to
the
sideboard
to
use
it
as
a
table
,
and
thus
necessarily
face
the
looking
-
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
let
us
drink
the
toast
of
toast
,
"
say
D'Arbino
.
<EOS>
"
Finello
,
Count
Fabio
 
the
lady
of
Pisa
!
"
  
Fabio
raise
the
wine
to
his
lip
,
and
be
on
the
point
of
drink
it
,
when
he
see
reflect
in
the
glass
the
figure
of
the
Yellow
Mask
.
<EOS>
the
glitter
eye
be
again
fix
on
him
,
and
the
yellow
-
hooded
head
bow
slowly
,
as
if
in
acknowledgment
of
the
toast
he
be
about
to
drink
.
<EOS>
for
the
third
time
the
strange
chill
seize
him
,
and
he
set
down
his
glass
of
wine
untaste
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
?
"
ask
D'Arbino
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
any
dislike

count
,
to
that
particular
wine

inquire
the
cavaliere

the
Yellow
Mask

"
<EOS>
whisper
Fabio
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Yellow
Mask
again
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
all
three
turn
round
directly
toward
the
door
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
too
late
 
<EOS>
the
figure
have
disappear
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
any
one
know
who
this
Yellow
Mask
be
?
"
ask
Finello
.
<EOS>
"
one
may
guess
by
the
walk
that
the
figure
be
a
woman
's
.
<EOS>
perhaps
it
may
be
the
strange
color
she
have
choose
for
her
dress
,
or
perhaps
her
stealthy
way
of
move
from
room
to
room
;
but
there
be
certainly
something
mysterious
and
startle
about
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
startle
enough
,
as
the
count
would
tell
you
,
"
say
D'Arbino
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Yellow
Mask
have
be
responsible
for
his
loss
of
spirit
and
change
of
complexion
,
and
now
she
have
prevent
him
even
from
drink
his
wine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
account
for
it
,
"
say
Fabio
,
look
round
him
uneasily
;
"
but
this
be
the
third
room
into
which
she
have
follow
me
 
the
third
time
she
have
seem
to
fix
her
eye
on
me
alone
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
my
nerve
be
hardly
in
a
fit
state
yet
for
masked
ball
and
adventure
;
the
sight
of
her
seem
to
chill
me
.
<EOS>
who
can
she
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
she
follow
me
a
fourth
time
,
"
say
Finello
,
"
I
should
insist
on
her
unmasking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
suppose
she
refuse
?
"
ask
his
friend
  
"
then
I
should
take
her
mask
off
for
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
impossible
to
do
that
with
a
woman
,
"
say
Fabio
.
<EOS>
"
I
prefer
try
to
lose
her
in
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
excuse
me
,
gentleman
,
if
I
leave
you
to
finish
the
wine
,
and
then
to
meet
me
,
if
you
like
,
in
the
great
ballroom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
retire
as
he
speak
,
put
on
his
mask
,
and
join
the
dancer
immediately
,
take
care
to
keep
always
in
the
most
crowded
corner
of
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
for
some
time
this
plan
of
action
prove
successful
,
and
he
see
no
more
of
the
mysterious
yellow
domino
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
however
,
some
new
dance
be
arrange
,
in
which
the
great
majority
of
the
person
in
the
ballroom
take
part
;
the
figure
resemble
the
old
english
country
dance
in
this
respect
,
that
the
lady
and
gentleman
be
place
in
long
row
opposite
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
the
set
consist
of
about
twenty
couple
each
,
place
sometimes
across
,
and
sometimes
along
the
apartment
;
and
the
spectator
be
all
require
to
move
away
on
either
side
,
and
range
themselves
close
to
the
wall
.
<EOS>
as
Fabio
among
other
comply
with
this
necessity
,
he
look
down
a
row
of
dancer
wait
during
the
performance
of
the
orchestral
prelude
;
and
there
,
watch
him
again
,
from
the
opposite
end
of
the
lane
form
by
the
gentleman
on
one
side
and
the
lady
on
the
other
,
he
see
the
Yellow
Mask
.
  
<EOS>
He
move
abruptly
back
,
toward
another
row
of
dancer
,
place
at
right
angle
to
the
first
row
;
and
there
again
;
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
gay
lane
of
brightly
-
dress
figure
,
be
the
Yellow
Mask
.
<EOS>
He
slip
into
the
middle
of
the
room
,
but
it
be
only
to
find
her
occupy
his
former
position
near
the
wall
,
and
still
,
in
spite
of
his
disguise
,
watch
him
through
row
after
row
of
dancer
.
<EOS>
the
persecution
begin
to
grow
intolerable
;
he
feel
a
kind
of
angry
curiosity
mingle
now
with
the
vague
dread
that
have
hitherto
oppress
him
.
<EOS>
Finello
's
advice
recur
to
his
memory
;
and
he
determine
to
make
the
woman
unmask
at
all
hazard
.
<EOS>
with
this
intention
he
return
to
the
supper
-
room
in
which
he
have
leave
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
go
,
probably
to
the
ballroom
,
to
look
for
him
.
<EOS>
plenty
of
wine
be
still
leave
on
the
sideboard
,
and
he
pour
himself
out
a
glass
.
<EOS>
find
that
his
hand
tremble
as
he
do
so
,
he
drink
several
more
glass
in
quick
succession
,
to
nerve
himself
for
the
approach
encounter
with
the
Yellow
Mask
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
drink
he
expect
every
moment
to
see
her
in
the
looking
-
glass
again
;
but
she
never
appear
 
<EOS>
and
yet
he
feel
almost
certain
that
he
have
detect
her
glide
out
after
him
when
he
leave
the
ballroom
.
  
<EOS>
He
think
it
possible
that
she
may
be
wait
for
him
in
one
of
the
small
apartment
,
and
,
take
off
his
mask
,
walk
through
several
of
them
without
meet
her
,
until
he
come
to
the
door
of
the
refreshment
-
room
in
which
Nanina
and
he
have
recognize
each
other
.
<EOS>
the
waiting
-
woman
behind
the
table
,
who
have
first
speak
to
him
,
catch
sight
of
him
now
,
and
run
round
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
come
in
and
speak
to
Nanina
again
,
"
she
say
,
mistake
the
purpose
which
have
bring
him
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
what
with
frighten
her
first
,
and
make
her
cry
afterward
,
you
have
render
her
quite
unfit
for
her
work
.
<EOS>
the
steward
be
in
there
at
this
moment
,
very
good
-
natured
,
but
not
very
sober
.
<EOS>
He
say
she
be
pale
and
red
-
eyed
,
and
not
fit
to
be
a
shepherdess
any
longer
,
and
that
,
as
she
will
not
be
miss
now
,
she
may
go
home
if
she
like
.
<EOS>
We
have
get
her
an
old
cloak
,
and
she
be
go
to
try
and
slip
through
the
room
unobserve

to
get
downstairs
and
change
her
dress

<EOS>
do
not
speak
to
her
,
pray
,
or
you
will
only
make
her
cry
again
;
and
what
be
bad
,
make
the
steward
fancy
"
  
<EOS>
She
stop
at
that
last
word
,
and
point
suddenly
over
Fabio
's
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"

Yellow
Mask

<EOS>
she
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"

chance
of
get
out

<EOS>
Fabio
turn
directly
,
and
approach
the
Mask

who
,
as
they
look
at
each
other

the
yellow
figure

apartment
to
another

toward
the
left

then
stop
.
<EOS>
the
bright
eye
fix
themselves
as
before
on
Fabio
's
face
,
but
only
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
He
hear
a
light
step
behind
him
,
and
then
he
see
the
eye
move
.
<EOS>
follow
the
direction
they
take
,
he
turn
round
,
and
discover
Nanina
,
wrap
up
in
the
old
cloak
which
be
to
enable

"

cry
the
girl
,
shrink
back
affrightedly
as

Yellow
Mask

"
<EOS>
that
way

"
say
Fabio

point
in
the
direction
of
the
ballroom

<EOS>
"
nobody
will
notice
you
in
the
cloak
;
it
will
only
be
think
some
new
disguise
.
"
<EOS>
He
take
her
arm
as
he
speak
,
to
reassure
her
,
and
continue
in
a
whisper
,
"
do
not
forget
to

"
  
<EOS>
at
the
same
moment
he
feel
a
hand
lay
on
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
hand
of
the
mask
woman
,
and
it
put
him
back
from
Nanina
.
  
<EOS>
in
spite
of
himself
,
he
tremble
at
her
touch
,
but
still
retain
presence
of
mind
enough
to
sign
to
the
girl
to
make
her
escape
.
<EOS>
with
a
look
of
eager
inquiry
in
the
direction
of
the
mask
,
and
a
half
suppress
exclamation
of
terror
,
she
obey
him
,
and
hasten
away
toward
the
ballroom
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
alone
,
"
say
Fabio
,
confront
the
gleam
black
eye
,
and
reach
out
his
hand
resolutely
toward
the
Yellow
Mask
.
<EOS>
"
tell
me
who
you
be
,
and
why
you
follow
me
,
or
I
will
uncover
your
face
,
and
solve
the
mystery
for
myself

"
  
<EOS>
the
woman
push
his
hand
aside
,
and
draw
back
a
few
pace
,
but
never
speak
a
word

<EOS>
He
follow
her

<EOS>
there

then

sound
of
footstep
hastily
approach

audible

<EOS>
"
now
or
never

"
he
whisper
to
himself
,
and
snatch
at
the
mask
.
  
<EOS>
His
arm
be
again
thrust
aside
;
but
this
time
the
woman
raise
her
disengaged
hand
at
the
same
moment
,
and
remove
the
yellow
mask
.
  
<EOS>
the
lamp
shed
their
soft
light
full
on
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
face
of
his
dead

<EOS>
Signor
Andrea
D'Arbino
,
search
vainly
through
the
various
room
in
the
palace
for
Count
Fabio
d'Ascoli
,
and
try
as
a
last
resource
,
the
corridor
lead
to
the
ballroom
and
grand
staircase
,
discover
his
friend
lie
on
the
floor
in
a
swoon
,
without
any
live
creature
near
him
.
<EOS>
determine
to
avoid
alarm
the
guest
,
if
possible
,
D'Arbino
first
seek
help
in
the
antechamber

<EOS>
He
find
there
the
marquis

valet
,
assist
the
Cavaliere
Finello
(
who
be
just

his
departure
)
to
put

his
cloak
.
  
<EOS>
while
Finello
and
his
friend
carry
Fabio
to
an
open
window
in
the
antechamber
,
the
valet
procure
some
ice
water
.
<EOS>
this
simple
remedy
,
and
the
change
of
atmosphere
,
prove
enough
to
restore
the
faint
man
to
his
sense
,
but
hardly
 
as
it
seem
to
his
friend
 
to
his
former
self
.
<EOS>
They
notice
a
change
to
blankness
and
stillness
in
his
face
,
and
when
he
speak
,
an
indescribable
alteration
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
find
you
in
a
room
in
the
corridor
,
"
say
D'Arbino
.
<EOS>
"
what
make
you
faint

<EOS>
do
not

<EOS>
be

"
  
<EOS>
Fabio
wait
for
a
moment
,
painfully
collect
his
idea
.
<EOS>
He
look
at
the
valet
,
and
Finello
sign
to
the
man
to
withdraw
.
  
<EOS>
"
be

"
repeat
D'Arbino
.
  
<EOS>
"
no

"
answer
Fabio
,
in
strangely
hush
,
steady
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
the
face
that
be
behind
the
yellow
mask
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well

"
  
<EOS>
"
It

"
Your

<EOS>
"
when
the

I
see
her
face
.
<EOS>
not
as
I
remember
it
in
the
pride
of
her
youth
and
beauty
 
not
even
as
I
remember
her
on
her
sick
-
bed
 
<EOS>
but
as
I
remember
her
in
her
coffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
count
!
<EOS>
for
God
's
sake
,
rouse
yourself
!
<EOS>
collect
your
thought
 
<EOS>
remember
where
you
be
 
and
free
your
mind
of
its
horrible
delusion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
spare
me
all
remonstrance
;
I
be
not
fit
to
bear
them
.
<EOS>
My
life
have
only
one
object
now
 
the
pursuing
of
this
mystery
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
Will
you
help
me
?
<EOS>
I
be
scarcely
fit
to
act
for
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
still
speak
in
the
same
unnaturally
hush
,
deliberate
tone
.
<EOS>
D'Arbino
and
Finello
exchange
glance
behind
him
as
he
rise
from
the
sofa
on
which
he
have
hitherto
be
lie
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
help
you
in
everything
,
"
say
D'Arbino
,
soothingly
.
<EOS>
"
trust
in
us
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
wish
to
do
first
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
figure
must
have
go
through
this
room
.
<EOS>
let
us
descend
the
staircase
and
ask
the
servant
if
they
have
see
it
pass
.
"
  
<EOS>
(
both
D'Arbino
and
Finello
remark
that
he
do
not
say
her
.
)
  
<EOS>
They
inquire
down
to
the
very
courtyard
.
<EOS>
not
one
of
the
servant
have
see
the
Yellow
Mask
.
  
<EOS>
the
last
resource
be
the
porter
at
the
outer
gate
.
<EOS>
They
apply
to
him
;
and
in
answer
to
their
question
he
assert
that
he

<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
they
be

the
porter
through
the
dark

silent

<EOS>
"
We

<EOS>
"
My

We

.
<EOS>
on
enter
the
stable

yard
,
they
find
that

<EOS>
"
You

"
<EOS>

"
  
<EOS>
"
where
do

take
her
from
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
from
a
very
extraordinary
place
 
from
the
gate
of
the
Campo
Santo
burial
-
ground
.
"
  
<EOS>
during
this
colloquy
,
Finello
and
D'Arbino
have
be
stand
with
Fabio
between
them
,
each
give
him
an
arm
.
<EOS>
the
instant
the
last
answer

,
he
reel
back
with
a
cry
of
horror

<EOS>
"
where

now
?
"
ask
D'Arbino
.
<EOS>
He
look
about
him
nervously
as
he
put
the
question
,
and
speak
for
the
first
time
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
the
Campo
Santo
again
,
"
say
the
coachman
.
  
<EOS>
Fabio
suddenly
draw
his
arm
out
of
the
arm
of
his
friend
,
and
sink
to
his
knee
on
the
ground
,
hide
his
face
.
<EOS>
from
some
broken
ejaculation
which
escape
him
,
it
seem
as
if
he
dread
that
his
sense
be
leave
him
,
and
that
he
be
pray
to
be
preserve
in
his
right
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
be
he
so
violently
agitate
?
"
say
Finello
,
eagerly
,
to
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
return
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
You
hear
him
say
that
when
he
see
the
face
behind
the
yellow
mask
,
it
be
the
face
of
his
dead
wife
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
but
what
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
wife
be
bury
in
the
Campo
Santo
.
"
  
.
  
<EOS>
of
all
the
person
who
have
be
present
,
in
any
capacity
,
at
the
Marquis
Melani
's
ball
,
the
early
riser
on
the
morning
after
it
be
Nanina
.
<EOS>
the
agitation
produce
by
the
strange
event
in
which
she
have
be
concern
destroy
the
very
idea
of
sleep
.
<EOS>
through
the
hour
of
darkness
she
could
not
even
close
her
eye
;
and
,
as
soon
as
the
new
day
break
,
she
rise
to
breathe
the
early
morning
air
at
her
window
,
and
to
think
in
perfect
tranquillity
over
all
that
have
pass
since
she
enter
the
Melani
Palace
to
wait
on
the
guest
at
the
masquerade
.
  
<EOS>
on
reach
home
the
previous
night
,
all
her
other
sensation
have
be
absorb
in
a
vague
feeling
of
mingled
dread
and
curiosity
,
produce
by
the
sight
of
the
weird
figure
in
the
yellow
mask
,
which
she
have
leave
stand
alone
with
Fabio
in
the
palace
corridor
.
<EOS>
the
morning
light
,
however
,
suggest
new
thought
.
<EOS>
She
now
open
the
note
which
the
young
nobleman
have
press
into
her
hand
,
and
read
over
and
over
again
the
hurried
pencil
line
scrawl
on
the
paper
.
<EOS>
Could
there
be
any
harm
,
any
forgetfulness
of
her
own
duty
,
in
use
the
key
inclose
in
the
note
,
and
keep
her
appointment
in
the
ascoli
garden
at
ten
o'clock
?
<EOS>
surely
not
 
surely
the
last
sentence
he
have
write
,
"
believe
in
my
truth
and
honor
,
Nanina
,
for
I
believe
implicitly
in
yours
,
"
be
enough
to
satisfy
her
this
time
that
she
could
not
be
do
wrong
in
listen
for
once
to
the
pleading
of
her
own
heart
.
<EOS>
and
besides
,
there
in
her
lap
lie
the
key
of
the
wicket
-
gate
.
<EOS>
It
be
absolutely
necessary
to
use
that
,
if
only
for
the
purpose
of
give
it
back
safely
into
the
hand
of
its
owner
.
  
<EOS>
as
this
last
thought
be
pass
through
her
mind
,
and
plausibly
overcome
any
faint
doubt
and
difficulty
which
she
may
still
have
leave
,
she
be
startle
by
a
sudden
knocking
at
the
street
door
;
and
,
look
out
of
the
window
immediately
,
see
a
man
in
livery
stand
in
the
street
,
anxiously
peer
up
at
the
house
to
see
if
his
knocking
have
arouse
anybody
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
Marta
Angrisani
,
the
sick
-
nurse

here
?
"
<EOS>
inquire
the
man
,
as
soon

at

answer
.

the

at
the
Ascoli
Palace
.
<EOS>
My
master
,
Count
Fabio
"
  
<EOS>
Nanina
wait
to
hear
no
more
.
<EOS>
She
fly
to
the
room
in
which
the
sick
-
nurse
sleep
,
and
awake
her
,
almost
roughly
,
in
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
"
He

ill
!
"
<EOS>
she
cry
,
breathlessly
.
<EOS>
"
oh

make
haste
,

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
Marta
inquire
who
have
send
for
her
,
and
on
be
inform
,
promise
to
lose
no
time
.
<EOS>
Nanina
run
downstairs
to
tell
the
servant
that
the
sick
-
nurse
be
get
on
her
clothe
.
<EOS>
the
man
's
serious
expression
,
when
she
come
close
to
him
,
terrify
her
.
<EOS>
all
her
usual
self
-
distrust
vanish
;
and
she
entreat
him
,
without
attempt
to
conceal
her
anxiety
,
to
tell
her
particularly
what
his
master
's
illness
be
,
and
how
it
have
affect
him
so
suddenly
after
the
ball
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
about
it
,
"
answer
the
man
,
notice
Nanina
's
manner
as
she
put
her
question
,
with
some
surprise
,
"
except
that
my
master
be
bring
home
by
two
gentleman
,
friend
of
his
,
about
a
couple
of
hour
ago
,
in
a
very
sad
state
;
half
out
of
his
mind
,
as
it
seem
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
gather
from
what
be
say
that
he
have
get
a
dreadful
shock
from
see
some
woman
take
off
her
mask
,
and
show
her
face
to
him
at
the
ball
.
<EOS>
how
that
could
be
I
do
not
in
the
least
understand
;
but
I
know
that
when
the
doctor
be
send
for
,
he
look
very
serious
,
and
talk
about
fear
brain
-
fever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
the
servant
stop
;
for
,
to
his
astonishment
,
he
see
Nanina
suddenly
turn
away
from
him
,
and
then
hear
her
cry
bitterly
as
she
go
back
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Marta
Angrisani
have
huddle
on
her
clothe
and
be
look
at
herself
in
the
glass
to
see
that
she
be
sufficiently
presentable
to
appear
at
the
palace
,
when
she
feel
two
arm
fling
round
her
neck
;
and
,
before
she
could
say
a
word
,
find
Nanina
sob
on
her
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
ill
 
<EOS>

be
in
danger
!
"
<EOS>
cry
the
girl
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
with
you
to
help
him
.
<EOS>
You
have
always
be
kind
to
me
,
Marta
 
be
kind
than
ever

<EOS>
take
me
with
you

with
you
to
the
palace

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
child
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
the
nurse
,
gently
unclasp
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
 
yes
!
<EOS>
if
it
be
only
for
an
hour
,
"
plead
Nanina
;
"
if
it
be
only
for
one
little
hour
every
day
.
<EOS>
You
have
only
to
say
that
I
be
your
helper
,
and
they
would
let
me
in
.
<EOS>
Marta
!
<EOS>
I
shall
break
my
heart
if
I
can
not
see
him
,
and
help
him
to
get
well
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
nurse
still
hesitate
.
<EOS>
Nanina
clasp
her
round
the
neck
once
more
,
and
lay
her
cheek
 
burn
hot
now
,
though
the
tear
have
be
stream
down
it
but
an
instant
before
 
close
to
the
good
woman
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
love
him
,
Marta
;
great
as
he
be
,
I
love
him
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
and
strength
,
"
she
go
on
,
in
quick
,
eager
,
whisper
tone
;
"
and
he
love
me
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
marry
me
if
I
have
not
go
away
to
save
him
from
it
.
<EOS>
I
could
keep
my
love
for
him
a
secret
while
he
be
well
;
I
could
stifle
it
,
and
crush
it
down
,
and
wither
it
up
by
absence
.
<EOS>
but
now
he
be
ill
,
it
get
beyond
me
;
I
can
not
master
it
.
<EOS>
oh
,
Marta
!
<EOS>
do
not
break
my
heart
by
deny
me
!
<EOS>
I
have
suffer
so
much
for
his
sake
,
that
I
have
earn
the
right
to
nurse
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Marta
be
not
proof
against
this
last
appeal
.
<EOS>
She
have
one
great
and
rare
merit
for
a
middle
-
aged
woman
 
<EOS>
she
have
not
forget
her
own
youth
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
child
,
"
say
she
,
soothingly
;
"
I
will
not
attempt
to
deny
you
.
<EOS>
dry
your
eye
,
put
on
your
mantilla
;
<EOS>
and
,
when
we
get
face
to
face
with
the
doctor
,
try
to
look
as
old
and
ugly
as
you
can
,
if
you
want
to
be
let
into
the
sick
-
room
along
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
ordeal
of
medical
scrutiny
be
pass
more
easily
than
Marta
Angrisani
have
anticipate
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
great
importance
,
in
the
doctor
's
opinion
,
that
the
sick
man
should
see
familiar
face
at
his
bedside
.
<EOS>
Nanina
have
only
,
therefore
,
to
state
that
he
know
her
well
,
and
that
she
have
sit
to
him
as
a
model
in
the
day
when
he
be
learn
the
art
of
sculpture
,
to
be
immediately
accept
as
Marta
's
privileged
assistant
in
the
sick
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
the
bad
apprehension
feel
by
the
doctor
for
the
patient
be
soon
realize
.
<EOS>
the
fever
fly
to
his
brain
.
<EOS>
for
nearly
six
week
he
lie
prostrate
,
at
the
mercy
of
death
;
now
rage
with
the
wild
strength
of
delirium
,
and
now
sink
in
the
speechless
,
motionless
,
sleepless
exhaustion
which
be
his
only
repose
.
<EOS>
at
last
;
the
bless
day
come
when
he
enjoy
his
first
sleep
,
and
when
the
doctor
begin
,
for
the
first
time
,
to
talk
of
the
future
with
hope
.
<EOS>
even
then
,
however
,
the
same
terrible
peculiarity
mark
his
light
dream
which
have
previously
show
itself
in
his
fierce
delirium
.
<EOS>
from
the
faintly
uttered
,
broken
phrase
which
drop
from
him
when
he
sleep
,
as
from
the
wild
word
which
burst
from
him
when
his
sense
be
derange
,
the
one
sad
discovery
inevitably
result
 
that
his
mind
be
still
haunt
,
day
and
night
,
hour
after
hour
,
by
the
figure
in
the
yellow
mask
.
  
<EOS>
as
his
bodily
health
improve
,
the
doctor
in
attendance
on
him
grow
more
and
more
anxious
as
to
the
state
of
his
mind
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
appearance
of
any
positive
derangement
of
intellect
,
but
there
be
a
mental
depression
 
an
unaltering
,
invincible
prostration
,
produce
by
his
absolute
belief
in
the
reality
of
the
dreadful
vision
that
he
have
see
at
the
mask
ball
 
which
suggest
to
the
physician
the
grave
doubt
about
the
case
.
<EOS>
He
see
with
dismay
that
the
patient
show
no
anxiety
,
as
he
get
strong
,
except
on
one
subject
.
<EOS>
He
be
eagerly
desirous
of
see
Nanina
every
day
by
his
bedside
;
but
,
as
soon
as
he
be
assure
that
his
wish
should
be
faithfully
comply
with
,
he
seem
to
care
for
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
even
when
they
propose
,
in
the
hope
of
rouse
him
to
an
exhibition
of
something
like
pleasure
,
that
the
girl
should
read
to
him
for
an
hour
every
day
out
of
one
of
his
favorite
book
,
he
only
show
a
languid
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
week
pass
away
,
and
still
,
do
what
they
would
,
they
could
not
make
him
so
much
as
smile
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
Nanina
have
begin
to
read
to
him
as
usual
,
but
have
not
proceed
far
before
Marta
Angrisani
inform
her
that
he
have
fall
into
a
doze
.
<EOS>
She
cease
with
a
sigh
,
and
sit
look
at
him
sadly
,
as
he
lie
near
her
,
faint
and
pale
and
mournful
in
his
sleep
 
miserably
alter
from
what
he
be
when
she
first
know
him
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
a
hard
trial
to
watch
by
his
bedside
in
the
terrible
time
of
his
delirium
;
but
it
be
a
hard
trial
still
to
look
at
him
now
,
and
to
feel
less
and
less
hopeful
with
each
succeed
day
.
  
<EOS>
while
her
eye
and
thought
be
still
compassionately
fix
on
him
,
the
door
of
the
bedroom
open
,
and
the
doctor
come
in
,
follow
by
Andrea
D'Arbino
,
whose
share
in
the
strange
adventure
with
the
Yellow
Mask
cause
him
to
feel
a
special
interest
in
Fabio
's
progress
toward
recovery
.
  
<EOS>
"
asleep
,
I
see
;
and
sigh
in
his
sleep

say
the
doctor
,
go
to
the
bedside

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
grand
difficulty
with
him

he
continue
,
turn
to
D'Arbino

precisely
what
it
be
.
<EOS>
I
have
hardly
leave
a
single
mean
untried
of
rouse
him
from
that
fatal
depression
;
yet
,
for
the
last
fortnight
,
he
have
not
advance
a
single
step
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
shake
his
conviction
of
the
reality
of
that
face
which
he
see
(
or
rather
which
he
think
he
see
)
when
the
yellow
mask
be
remove
;
and
,
as
long
as
he
persist
in
his
own
shocking
view
of
the
case
,
so
long
he
will
lie
there
,
get
well
,
<EOS>
no
doubt
,
as
to
his
body
,
but
bad
as
to
his
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
poor
fellow
,
he
be
not
in
a
fit
state
to
be
reason
with
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
on
the
contrary
,
like
all
man
with
a
fix
delusion
,
he
have
plenty
of
intelligence
to
appeal
to
on
every
point
,
except
the
one
point
on
which
he
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
have
argue
with
him
vainly
by
the
hour
together
.
<EOS>
He
possess
,
unfortunately
,
an
acute
nervous
sensibility
and
a
vivid
imagination
;
and
besides
,
he
have
,
as
I
suspect
,
be
superstitiously
bring
up
as
a
child
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
probably
useless
to
argue
rationally
with
him
on
certain
spiritual
subject
,
even
if
his
mind
be
in
perfect
health
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
good
deal
of
the
mystic
and
the
dreamer
in
his
composition
;
and
science
and
logic
be
but
broken
reed
to
depend
upon
with
man
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
he
merely
listen
to
you
when
you
reason
with
him
,
or
do
he
attempt
to
answer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
only
one
form
of
answer
,
and
that
be
,
unfortunately
,
the
most
difficult
of
all
to
dispose
of
.
<EOS>
whenever
I
try
to
convince
him
of
his
delusion
,
he
invariably
retort
by
ask
me
for
a
rational
explanation
of
what
happen
to
him
at
the
mask
ball
.
<EOS>
now
,
neither
you
nor
I
,
though
we
believe
firmly
that
he
have
be
the
dupe
of
some
infamous
conspiracy
,
have
be
able
as
yet
to
penetrate
thoroughly
into
this
mystery
of
the
Yellow
Mask
.
<EOS>
Our
common
sense
tell
us
that
he
must
be
wrong
in
take
his
view
of
it
,
and
that
we
must
be
right
in
take
our
;
but
if
we
can
not
give
him
actual
,
tangible
proof
of
that
 
if
we
can
only
theorize
,
when
he
ask
us
for
an
explanation
 
<EOS>
it
be
but
too
plain
,
in
his
present
condition
,
that
every
time
we
remonstrate
with
him
on
the
subject
we
only
fix
him
in
his
delusion
more
and
more
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
for
want
of
perseverance
on
my
part
,
"
say
D'Arbino
,
after
a
moment
of
silence
,
"
that
we
be
still
leave
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
ever
since
the
extraordinary
statement
of
the
coachman
who
drive
the
woman
home
,
I
have
be
inquire
and
investigate
.
<EOS>
I
have
offer
the
reward
of
two
hundred
scudi
for
the
discovery
of
her
;
I
have
myself
examine
the
servant
at
the
palace
,
the
night
-
watchman
at
the
Campo
Santo
,
the
police
-
book
,
the
list
of
keeper
of
hotel
and
lodging
-
house
,
to
hit
on
some
trace
of
this
woman
;
and
I
have
fail
in
all
direction
.
<EOS>
if
my
poor
friend
's
perfect
recovery
do
indeed
depend
on
his
delusion
be
combat
by
actual
proof
,
I
fear
we
have
but
little
chance
of
restore
him
.
<EOS>
so
far
as
I
be
concern
,
I
confess
myself
at
the
end
of
my
resource
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
we
be
not
quite
conquered
yet
,
"
return
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
the
proof
we
want
may
turn
up
when
we
least
expect
them
.
<EOS>
It
be
certainly
a
miserable
case
,
"
he
continue
,
mechanically
lay
his
finger
on
the
sleep
man
's
pulse
.
<EOS>
"
there
he
lie
,
want
nothing
now
but
to
recover
the
natural
elasticity
of
his
mind
;
and
here
we
stand
at
his
bedside
,
unable
to
relieve
him
of
the
weight
that
be
press
his
faculty
down
.
<EOS>
I
repeat
it
,
Signor
Andrea
,
nothing
will
rouse
him
from
his
delusion
that
he
be
the
victim
of
a
supernatural
interposition
but
the
production
of
some
startling
,
practical
proof
of
his
error
.
<EOS>
at
present
he
be
in
the
position
of
a
man
who
have
be
imprison
from
his
birth
in
a
dark
room
,
and
who
deny
the
existence
of
daylight
.
<EOS>
if
we
can
not
open
the
shutter
and
show
him
the
sky
outside
,
we
shall
never
convert
him
to
a
knowledge
of
the
truth
.
"
  
<EOS>
say
these
word
,
the
doctor
turn
to
lead
the
way
out
of
the
room
,
and
observe
Nanina
,
who
have
move
from
the
bedside
on
his
entrance
,
stand
near
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
stop
to
look
at
her
,
shake
his
head
good
-
humoredly
,
and
call
to
Marta
,
who
happen
to
be
occupy
in
an
adjoining
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Signora
Marta
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
"
I
think
you
tell
me
some
time
ago
that
your
pretty
and
careful
little
assistant

in
your

pray
,
do
she
take
much
walk
exercise

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
little
,
Signor
Dottore

<EOS>
She
go
home
to
her
sister
when
she
leave
the
palace
.
<EOS>
very
little
walk
exercise
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
!
<EOS>
Her
pale
cheek
and
heavy
eye
tell
me
as
much
.
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
address
Nanina
,
"
you
be
a
very
good
girl
,
and
I
be
sure
you
will
attend
to
what
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
go
out
every
morning
before
you
come
here
,
and
take
a
walk
in
the
fresh
air
.
<EOS>
You
be
too
young
not
to
suffer
by
be
shut
up
in
close
room
every
day
,
unless
you
get
some
regular
exercise

<EOS>
take
a
good
long
walk
in
the
morning
,
or
you
will
fall
into
my
hand
as
a
patient
,
and
be
quite
unfit
to
continue
your
attendance
here
.
<EOS>
now
,
Signor
Andrea
,
I
be
ready
for
you
.
<EOS>
mind
,
my
child
,
a
walk
every
day
in
the
open
air
outside
the
town
,
or
you
will
fall
ill
,
take
my
word
for
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
Nanina
promise
compliance
;
but
she
speak
rather
absently
,
and
seem
scarcely
conscious
of
the
kind
familiarity
which
mark
the
doctor
's
manner
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
that
all
her
thought
be
occupy
with
what
he
have
be
say
by
Fabio
's
bedside
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
lose
one
word
of
the
conversation
while
the
doctor
be
talk
of
his
patient
,
and
of
the
condition
on
which
his
recovery
depend
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
if
that
proof
which
would
cure
him
could
only
be
find
!
<EOS>
"
she
think
to
herself
,
as
she
steal
back
anxiously
to
the
bedside
when
the
room
be
empty
.
  
<EOS>
on
get
home
that
day
she
find
a
letter
wait
for
her
,
and
be
greatly
surprised
to
see
that
it
be
write
by
no
less
a
person
than
the
master
-
sculptor
,
Luca
Lomi
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
short
;
simply
inform
her
that
he
have
just
return
to
Pisa
,
and
that
he
be
anxious
to
know
when
she
could
sit
to
him
for
a
new
bust
 
<EOS>
a
commission
from
a
rich
foreigner
at
Naples
.
  
<EOS>
Nanina
debate
with
herself
for
a
moment
whether
she
should
answer
the
letter
in
the
hard
way
,
to
her
,
by
writing
,
or
,
in
the
easy
way
,
in
person
;
and
decide
on
go
to
the
studio
and
tell
the
master
-
sculptor
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
serve
him
as
a
model
,
at
least
for
some
time
to
come
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
take
her
a
long
hour
to
say
this
with
due
propriety
on
paper
;
it
would
only
take
her
a
few
minute
to
say
it
with
her
own
lip
.
<EOS>
so
she
put
on
her
mantilla
again
and
depart
for
the
studio
.
  
<EOS>
on
,
arrive
at
the
gate
and
ring
the
bell
,
a
thought
suddenly
occur
to
her
,
which
she
wonder
have
not
strike
her
before
.
<EOS>
be
it
not
possible
that
she
may
meet
Father
Rocco
in
his
brother
's
work
-
room
?
<EOS>
It
be
too
late
to
retreat
now
,
but
not
too
late
to
ask
,
before
she
enter
,
if
the
priest
be
in
the
studio
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
when
one
of
the
workman
open
the
door
to
her
,
she
inquire
first
,
very
confusedly
and
anxiously
,
for
Father
Rocco
.
<EOS>
hear
that
he
be
not
with
his
brother
then
,
she
go
tranquilly
enough
to
make
her
apology
to
the
master
-
sculptor
.
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
tell
him
more
than
that
she
be
now
occupy
every
day
by
nursing
duty
in
a
sick
-
room
,
and
that
it
be
consequently
out
of
her
power
to
attend
at
the
studio
.
<EOS>
Luca
Lomi
express
,
and
evidently
feel
,
great
disappointment
at
her
fail
him
as
a
model
,
and
try
hard
to
persuade
her
that
she
may
find
time
enough
,
if
she
choose
,
to
sit
to
him
,
as
well
as
to
nurse
the
sick
person
.
<EOS>
the
more
she
resist
his
argument
and
entreaty
,
the
more
obstinately
he
reiterate
them
.
<EOS>
He
be
dust
his
favorite
bust
and
statue
,
after
his
long
absence
,
with
a
feather
-
brush
when
she
come
in
;
and
he
continue
this
occupation
all
the
while
he
be
talk
 
urge
a
fresh
plea
to
induce
Nanina
to
reconsider
her
refusal
to
sit
at
every
fresh
piece
of
sculpture
he
come
to
,
and
always
receive
the
same
resolute
apology
from
her
as
she
slowly
follow
him
down
the
studio
toward
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
arrive
thus
at
the
low
end
of
the
room
,
Luca
stop
with
a
fresh
argument
on
his
lip
before
his
statue
of
Minerva
.
<EOS>
He
have
dust
it
already
,
but
he
lovingly
return
to
dust
it
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
his
favorite
work
 
the
only
good
likeness
(
although
it
do
assume
to
represent
a
classical
subject
)
of
his
dead
daughter
that
he
possess
.
<EOS>
He
have
refuse
to
part
with
it
for
Maddalena
's
sake
;
and
,
as
he
now
approach
it
with
his
brush
for
the
second
time
,
he
absently
cease
speak
,
and
mount
on
a
stool
to
look
at
the
face
near
and
blow
some
speck
of
dust
off
the
forehead
.
<EOS>
Nanina
think
this
a
good
opportunity
of
escape
from
further
importunity
.
<EOS>
She
be
on
the
point
of
slip
away
to
the
door
with
a
word
of
farewell
,
when
a
sudden
exclamation
from
Luca
Lomi
arrest
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Plaster
!
"
cry
the
master
-
sculptor
,
look
intently
at
that
part
of
the
hair
of
the
statue
which
lie
lowest
on
the
forehead
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Plaster
here
!
"
<EOS>
He
take
out
his
penknife
as
he
speak
,
and
remove
a
tiny
morsel
of
some
white
substance
from
an
interstice
between
two
fold
of
the
hair
where
it
touch
the
face
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
plaster
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
,
excitedly
.
"
<EOS>
somebody
have
be
take
a
cast
from
the
face
of
my
statue
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
jump
off
the
stool
,
and
look
all
round
the
studio
with
an
expression
of
suspicious
inquiry
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
this
clear
up
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
My
statue
be
leave
under
Rocco
's
care
,
and
he
be
answerable
if
there
have
be
any
stealing
of
cast
from
any
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
must
question
him
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Nanina
,
see
that
he
take
no
notice
of
her
,
feel
that
she
may
now
easily
effect
her
retreat
.
<EOS>
She
open
the
studio
door
,
and
repeat
,
for
the
twentieth
time
at
least
,
that
she
be
sorry
she
could
not
sit
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
too
,
child
,
"
he
say
,
irritably
look
about
for
his
hat
.
<EOS>
He
find
it
apparently
just
as
Nanina
be
go
out
;
for
she
hear
him
call
to
one
of
the
workman
in
the
inner
studio
,
and
order
the
man
to
say
,
if
anybody
want
him
,
that
he
have
go
to
Father
Rocco
's
lodging
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
,
when
Nanina
rise
,
a
bad
attack
of
headache
,
and
a
sense
of
languor
and
depression
,
remind
her
of
the
necessity
of
follow
the
doctor
's
advice
,
and
preserve
her
health
by
get
a
little
fresh
air
and
exercise
.
<EOS>
She
have
more
than
two
hour
to
spare
before
the
usual
time
when
her
daily
attendance
begin
at
the
Ascoli
Palace
;
and
she
determine
to
employ
the
interval
of
leisure
in
take
a
morning
walk
outside
the
town
.
<EOS>
La
Biondella
would
have
be
glad
enough
to
go
too
,
but
she
have
a
large
order
for
dinner
-
mat
on
hand
,
and
be
oblige
,
for
that
day
,
to
stop
in
the
house
and
work
.
<EOS>
thus
it
happen
that
when
Nanina
set
forth
from
home
,
the
learn
poodle
,
Scarammuccia
,
be
her
only
companion
.
  
<EOS>
She
take
the
near
way
out
of
the
town
;
the
dog
trot
along
in
his
usual
steady
,
observant
way
close
at
her
side
,
push
his
great
rough
muzzle
,
from
time
to
time
,
affectionately
into
her
hand
,
and
try
hard
to
attract
her
attention
at
interval
by
bark
and
caper
in
front
of
her
.
<EOS>
He
get
but
<EOS>
little
notice
,
however
,
for
his
pain
.
<EOS>
Nanina
be
think
again
of
all
that
the
physician
have
say
the
day
before
by
Fabio
's
bedside
,
and
these
thought
bring
with
them
other
,
equally
absorb
,
that
be
connect
with
the
mysterious
story
of
the
young
nobleman
's
adventure
with
the
Yellow
Mask
.
<EOS>
thus
preoccupy
,
she
have
little
attention
leave
for
the
gambol
of
the
dog
.
<EOS>
even
the
beauty
of
the
morning
appeal
to
her
in
vain
.
<EOS>
She
feel
the
refreshment
of
the
cool
,
fragrant
air
,
but
she
hardly
notice
the
lovely
blue
of
the
sky
,
or
the
bright
sunshine
that
give
a
gayety
and
an
interest
to
the
common
object
around
her
.
  
<EOS>
after
walk
nearly
an
hour
,
she
begin
to
feel
tired
,
and
look
about

a
shady
place
to

<EOS>
beyond
and
behind
her
there
be
only
the
high
-
road
and
the
flat
country
;
but
by
her
side
stand
a
little
wooden
building
,
half
inn
,
half
coffee
-
house
,
back
by
a
large
,
shady
pleasure
.
<EOS>
garden
,
the
gate
of
which
stand
invitingly
open
.
<EOS>
some
workman
in
the
garden
be
put
up
a
stage
for
firework
,
but
the
place
be
otherwise
quiet
and
lonely
enough
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
use
at
night
as
a
sort
of
rustic
Ranelagh
,
to
which
the
citizen
of
Pisa
resort
for
pure
air
and
amusement
after
the
fatigue
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
observe
that
there
be
no
visitor
in
the
ground
,
Nanina
venture
in
,
intend
to
take
a
quarter
of
an
hour
's
rest
in
the
cool
place
she
could
find
before
return
to
Pisa
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
pass
the
back
of
a
wooden
summer
-
house
in
a
secluded
part
of
the
garden
,
when
she
suddenly
miss
the
dog
from
her
side
;
and
,
look
round
after
him
,
see
that
he
be
stand
behind
the
summer
-
house
with
his
ear
erect
and
his
nose
to
the
ground
,
have
evidently
that
instant
scent
something
that
excite
his
suspicion
.
  
<EOS>
think
it
possible
that
he
may
be
meditate
an
attack
on
some
unfortunate
cat
,
she
turn
to
see
what
he
be
watch
.
<EOS>
the
carpenter
engage
on
the
firework
stage
be
just
then
hammer
at
it
violently
.
<EOS>
the
noise
prevent
her
from
hear
that
Scarammuccia
be
growl
,
but
she
could
feel
that
he
be
the
moment
she
lay
her
hand
on
his
back
.
<EOS>
Her
curiosity
be
excited
,
and
she
stoop
down
close
to
him
to
look
through
a
crack
in
the
board
before
which
he
stand
into
the
summer
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
startle
at
see
a
lady
and
gentleman
sit
inside
.
<EOS>
the
place
she
be
look
through
be
not
high
enough
up
to
enable
her
to
see
their
face
,
but
she
recognize
,
or
think
she
recognize
,
the
pattern
of
the
lady
's
dress
as
one
which
she
have
notice
in
former
day
in
the
Demoiselle
Grifoni
's
show
-
room
.
<EOS>
rise
quickly
,
her
eye
detect
a
hole
in
the
board
about
the
level
of
her
own
height
,
cause
by
a
knot
have
be
force
out
of
the
wood
.
<EOS>
She
look
through
it
to
ascertain
,
without
be
discover
,
if
the
wearer
of
the
familiar
dress
be
the
person
she
have
take
her
to
be
;
and
see
,
not
Brigida
only
,
as
she
have
expect
,
but
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
as
well
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
moment
the
carpenter
leave
off
hammer
and
begin
to
saw
.
<EOS>
the
new
sound
from
the
firework
stage
be
regular
and
not
loud
.
<EOS>
the
voice
of
the
occupant
of
the
summer
-
house
reach
her
through
it
,
and
she
hear
Brigida
pronounce
the
name
of
Count
Fabio
.
  
<EOS>
instantly
stoop
down
once
more
by
the
dog
's
side
,
she
catch
his
muzzle
firmly
in
both
her
hand
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
only
way
to
keep
Scarammuccia
from
growl
again
,
at
a
time
when
there
be
no
din
of
hammer
to
prevent
him
from
be
hear
.
<EOS>
those
two
word
,
"
Count
Fabio
,
"
in
the
mouth
of
another
woman
,
excite
a
jealous
anxiety
in
her
.
<EOS>
what
could
Brigida
have
to
say
in
connection
with
that
name
?
<EOS>
She
never
come
near
the
Ascoli
Palace
 
<EOS>
what
right
or
reason
<EOS>
could
she
have
to
talk
of
Fabio
?
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
hear
what
I
say
?
<EOS>
"
she
hear
Brigida
ask
,
in
her
cool
,
hard
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
the
priest
answer
.
<EOS>
"
at
least
,
not
all
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
repeat
it
,
then
.
<EOS>
I
ask
what
have
so
suddenly
determine
you
to
give
up
all
idea
of
make
any
future
experiment
on
the
superstitious
fear
of
Count
Fabio
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
the
first
place
,
the
result
of
the
experiment
already
try
have
be
so
much
more
serious
than
I
have
anticipate
,
that
I
believe
the
end
I
have
in
view
in
make
it
have
be
answer
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
well
;
that
be
not
your
only
reason
?
"
  
"
another
shock
to
his
mind
may
be
fatal
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
can
use
what
I
believe
to
be
a
justifiable
fraud
to
prevent
his
marrying
again
;
but
I
can
not
burden
myself
with
a
crime
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
your
second
reason
;
but
I
believe
you
have
another
yet
.
<EOS>
the
suddenness
with
which
you
send
to
me
last
night
to
appoint
a
meeting
in
this
lonely
place
;
the
emphatic
manner
in
which
you
request
 
I
may
almost
say
order
 
me
to
bring
the
wax
mask
here
,
suggest
to
my
mind
that
something
must
have
happen
.
<EOS>
what
be
it
?
<EOS>
I
be
a
woman
,
and
my
curiosity
must
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
after
the
secret
you
have
trust
to
me
already
,
you
need
not
hesitate
,
I
think
,
to
trust
me
with
one
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
not
.
<EOS>
the
secret
this
time
be
,
moreover
,
of
no
great
importance
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
the
wax
mask
you
wear
at
the
ball
be
make
in
a
plaster
mold
take
off
the
face
of
my
brother
's
statue
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
know
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
brother
have
just
return
to
his
studio
;
have
find
a
morsel
of
the
plaster
I
use
for
the
mold
stick
in
the
hair
of
the
statue
;
and
have
ask
me
,
as
the
person
leave
in
charge
of
his
work
-
room
,
for
an
explanation
.
<EOS>
such
an
explanation
as
I
could
offer
have
not
satisfy
him
,
and
he
talk
of
make
further
inquiry
.
<EOS>
consider
that
it
will
be
use
no
more
,
I
think
it
safest
to
destroy
the
wax
mask
,
and
I
ask
you
to
bring
it
here
,
that
I
may
see
it
burn
or
break
up
with
my
own
eye
.
<EOS>
now
you
know
all
you
want
to
know
;
and
now
,
therefore
,
it
be
my
turn
to
remind
you
that
I
have
not
yet
have
a
direct
answer
to
the
first
question
I
address
to
you
when
we
meet
here
.
<EOS>
have
you
bring
the
wax
mask
with
you
,
or
have
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
?
"
  
<EOS>
just
as
that
question
be
put
,
Nanina
feel
the
dog
drag
himself
free
of
her
grasp
on
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
listen
hitherto
with
such
painful
intensity
,
with
such
all
-
absorb
emotion
of
suspense
,
terror
,
and
astonishment
,
that
she
have
not
notice
his
effort
to
get
away
,
and
have
continue
mechanically
to
hold
his
mouth
shut
.
<EOS>
but
now
she
be
arouse
by
the
violence
of
his
struggle
to
the
knowledge
that
,
unless
she
hit
upon
some
new
mean
of
quiet
him
,
he
would
have
his
mouth
free
,
and
would
betray
her
by
a
growl
.
  
<EOS>
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
lest
she
should
lose
a
word
of
the
momentous
conversation
,
she
make
a
desperate
attempt
to
appeal
to
the
dog
's
fondness
for
her
,
by
suddenly
fling
both
her
arm
round
his
neck
,
and
kiss
his
rough
,
hairy
cheek
.
<EOS>
the
stratagem
succeed
.
<EOS>
Scarammuccia
have
,
for
many
year
past
,
never
receive
any
great
mark
of
his
mistress
's
kindness
for
him
than
such
as
a
pat
on
the
head
or
a
present
of
a
lump
of
sugar
may
convey
.
<EOS>
His
dog
's
nature
be
utterly
confound
by
the
unexpected
warmth
of
Nanina
's
caress
,
and
he
struggle
up
vigorously
in
her
arm
to
try
and
return
it
by
lick
her
face
.
<EOS>
She
could
easily
prevent
him
from
do
this
,
and
could
so
gain
a
few
minute
more
to
listen
behind
the
summer
-
house
without
danger
of
discovery
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
lose
Brigida
's
answer
to
Father
Rocco
's
question
;
but
she
be
in
time
to
hear
her
next
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
alone
here
,
"
say
Brigida
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
a
woman
,
and
I
do
not
know
that
you
may
not
have
come
armed
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
the
common
precaution
on
my
part
not
to
give
you
a
chance
of
get
at
the
wax
mask
till
I
have
make
my
condition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
never
say
a
word
about
condition
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
true
.
<EOS>
I
remember
tell
you
that
I
want
nothing
but
the
novelty
of
go
to
the
masquerade
in
the
character
of
my
dead
enemy
,
and
the
luxury
of
be
able
to
terrify
the
man
who
have
brutally
ridicule
me
in
old
day
in
the
studio
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
truth
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
the
less
the
truth
that
our
experiment
on
Count
Fabio
have
detain
me
in
this
city
much
longer
than
I
ever
intend
,
that
I
be
all
but
penniless
,
and
that
I
deserve
to
be
pay
.
<EOS>
in
plain
word
,
will
you
buy
the
mask
of
me
for
two
hundred
scudi
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
twenty
scudi
in
the
world
,
at
my
own
free
disposal
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
must
find
two
hundred
if
you
want
the
wax
mask
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
wish
to
threaten
 
but
money
I
must
have
.
<EOS>
I
mention
the
sum
of
two
hundred
scudi
,
because
that
be
the
exact
amount
offer
in
the
public
handbill
by
Count
Fabio
's
friend
for
the
discovery
of
the
woman
who
wear
the
yellow
mask
at
the
Marquis
Melani
's
ball
.
<EOS>
what
have
I
to
do
but
to
earn
that
money
if
I
please
,
by
go
to
the
palace
,
take
the
wax
mask
with
me
,
and
tell
them
that
I
be
the
woman
.
<EOS>
suppose
I
confess
in
that
way
;
they
can
do
nothing
to
hurt
me
,
and
I
should
be
two
hundred
scudi
the
rich
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
injure
,
to
be
sure
,
if
they
insist
on
know
who
make
the
wax
model
,
and
who
suggest
the
ghastly
disguise
"
  
"
wretch
!
<EOS>
do
you
believe
that
my
character
could
be
injure
on
the
unsupported
evidence
of
any
word
from
your
lip

"
  
<EOS>
"
Father
Rocco
,
for
the
first
time

I
have
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance

I
find
you
commit
a
breach

good
manner

I
shall
leave

late

<EOS>
an
instant
of
silence
follow
;
and
then
Nanina
judge
that
Brigida
must
be
depart
,
for
she
hear
the
rustling
of
a
dress
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
summer
-
house
.
<EOS>
unfortunately
,
Scarammuccia
hear
it
too
.
<EOS>
He
twist
himself
round
in
her
arm
and
growl
.
  
<EOS>
the
noise
disturb
Father
Rocco
.
<EOS>
She
hear
him
rise
and
leave
the
summer
-
house
.
<EOS>
there
would
have
be
time
enough
,
perhaps
,
for
her
to
conceal
herself
among
some
tree
if
she
could
have
recover
her
self
-
possession
at
once
;
but
she
be
incapable
of
make
an
effort
to
regain
it
.
<EOS>
She
could
neither
think
nor
move
 
<EOS>
her
breath
seem
to
die
away
on
her
lip
 
as
she
see
the
shadow
of
the
priest
steal
over
the
grass
slowly
from
the
front
to
the
back
of
the
summer
-
house
.
<EOS>
in
another
moment
they
be
face
to
face

<EOS>
He
stop
a
few
pace
from
her
,
and
eye
her
steadily
in
dead
silence
.
<EOS>
She
still
crouch
against
the
summer
-
house
,
and
still
with
one
hand
mechanically
keep
her
hold
of
the
dog
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
for
the
priest
that
she
do
so
.
<EOS>
Scarammuccia
's
formidable
tooth
be
in
full
view
,
his
shaggy
coat
be
bristle
,
his
eye
be
start
,
his
growl
have
change
from
the
surly
to
the
savage
note

ready

tear
down

not
Father

calmly

see
it
in

have
hear
all

She
could
not
answer
a
word
;
she
could
not
take
her
eye
from
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
unnatural
stillness
in
his
face

a
steady
,
unrepentant
,
unfathomable
despair
in
his

strike
her
with
horror

short
silence

thoughtfully
,

with
a
strange

tranquil
sadness
in

voice

the
instrument
of
the
retribution

Can
this
be

Heaven
 
or

it
nothing

look
upward

doubtingly

to
the
lustrous
sky
above
him

and
sigh
.

Nanina

eye
still
follow
his
mechanically

He
seem
to
feel
their
influence

suddenly
look
down
at

again

they
choose
to
pass
on
him

<EOS>
I
have
a
copy
of
the

to
prove
that
he
have
at
least
be
candid
,
and
that
he
do
not
shrink
from
consequence
which
he
may
have
avoid
by
flight
.
<EOS>
the
law
can
not
touch
him
,
but
the
Church
can
 
and
to
the
Church
he
have
confess
.
<EOS>
all
I
ask
be
,
that
he
may
be
spare
a
public
exposure
.
<EOS>
such
an
exposure
would
do
no
good
to
the
count
,
and
it
would
do
dreadful
injury
to
me
.
<EOS>
look
over
the
paper
yourself
,
and
show
them
,
whenever
you
think
proper
,
to
the
master
of
this

<EOS>
I

He

great
humility

<EOS>
the

look
over
them
with
some
curiosity
.
  
<EOS>
the
statement
or
confession
begin
by
boldly
avow
the

's
conviction
that
part
of
the
property
which
the
Count
Fabio

<EOS>
the
various
authority
on
which
this
assertion
be
base
be
then
produce
in
due
order
;
along
with
some
curious
particle
of
evidence
cull
from
old
manuscript
,
which
it
must
have
cost
much
trouble
to
collect
and
decipher
.
  
<EOS>
the
second
section
be
devote
,
at
great
length
,
to
the
reason
which
induce

as

affectionate
son
and
faithful
servant
of
the

not

rest
until
he

of
the
apostle
in
his
day
the
property
which
have
be
fraudulently

<EOS>
the

,
in
the
last
resort
,
and
in
that
only
,
in
use
any
mean
for
effect
this

in
the
first
place

and
,
when
she

,
if
Fabio

Fabio
's
marry
again
,
and
fill
with
the
resolution
to
prevent
any
such
disastrous
second
union
at
all
hazard
.
<EOS>
He
assert
that
the
idea
of
take
the
wax
mask
from
his
brother
's
statue
flash
upon
him
on
a
sudden
,
and
that
he
know
of
nothing
to
lead
to
it
,
except
,
perhaps
,
that
he
have
be
think
just
before
of
the
superstitious
nature
of
the
young
man
's
character
,
as
he
have
himself

<EOS>
He
further
declare
that
the
idea
of
the
wax
mask
terrify
him
at
first
;
that
he
strove
against
it
as
against
a
temptation
of
the
devil

from
fear
of

that
the
young
nobleman
be
go
to
the
ball
,
but
that
he
would
certainly
marry
for
the
second
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
fifth
section
relate
that
the
writer
,
upon
this
,
yield
to
temptation
rather
than
forego
the
cherished
purpose
of
his
life
by
allow
Fabio
a
chance
of
marry
again
 
that
he
make
the
wax
mask

statue
 
and
that
he

Brigida
(
of

who
be
ready
and
anxious
,
from
motive
of
private
malice

to
Fabio
would
pave
the
way
in
his
mind
for
the
approach
impersonation
,
and
have
write
the
letter
herself
.
<EOS>
however
,
even
when
all
the
preparation
be
make
,
the
writer
declare
that
he
shrink
from
proceed
to
extremity
;
and
that
he
would
have
abandon
the
whole
project
but
for
the
woman
Brigida
inform
him
one
day
that
a
work
-
girl
name
Nanina
be

be
one
of
the
attendant
at
the
ball
.
<EOS>
He
know
the
count
to
have
be
in
love
with
this
girl
,
even
to
the
point
of
wish
to
marry
her
;
he
suspect
that
her
engagement
to
wait
at
the
ball
be
preconcerte
;
and
,
in
consequence
,
he
authorize
his
female
accomplice
to
perform
her
part
in
the
conspiracy
.
  
<EOS>
the
sixth
section
detail
the
proceeding
at
the
masquerade
,
and
contain
the
writer
's
confession
that
,
on
the
night
before

he
have
write
to
the
count
propose
the
reconciliation
of
a
difference
that
have
take
place
between
them
,
solely
for
the
purpose
of
guard
himself
against
suspicion
.
<EOS>
He
next
acknowledge
that
he
have
borrow
the
key
of
the
Campo
Santo
gate
,
keep
the
authority
to
whom
it
be
intrust
in
perfect
ignorance
of
the
purpose
for
which
he
want
it
.
<EOS>
that
purpose
be
to
carry
out
the
ghastly
delusion
of
the
wax
mask
(
in
the
very
probable
event
of
the
wearer
be
follow
and
inquire
after
)
by
have
the
woman
Brigida
take
up
and
set
down
at

gate
of

<EOS>
the
seventh
section
solemnly
aver
that
the
sole
object
of
the
conspiracy
be
to
prevent
the
young
nobleman
from
marry
again
,
by
work
on
his
superstitious
fear
;
the
writer
repeat
,
after
this
avowal
,
that
any
such
second
marriage
would
necessarily
destroy
his
project
for
promote
the
ultimate
restoration
of
the
Church
possession
,
by
divert
Count
Fabio
's
property
,
in
great
part
,
from
his
first
wife
's
child
,
over
whom
the
priest
would
always
have
influence
,
to
another
wife
and
probably
other
child
,
over
whom
he
could
hope
to
have
none
.
  
<EOS>
the
eighth
and
last
section
express
the
writer
's
contrition
for
have
allow
his
zeal
for
the
Church
to
mislead
him
into
action
liable
to
bring
scandal
on
his
cloth
;
reiterate
in
the
strong
language
his
conviction
that
,
whatever
may
be
think
of
the
mean
employ
,
the
end
he
have
propose
to
himself
be
a
most
righteous
one
;
and
conclude
by
assert
his
resolution
to
suffer
with
humility
any
penalty
,
however
severe
,
which
his
ecclesiastical
superior
may
think
fit
to
inflict
on
him
.
  
<EOS>
have
look
over
this
extraordinary
statement
,
the
doctor
address
himself
again
to
Luca
Lomi
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
agree
with
you

"
he
say
,
"
that
no
useful
end
be
to
be
gain
now
by
mention
your
brother

conduct
in
public
 
always
provide
,
however
,
that
his
ecclesiastical

do
their
duty
.
<EOS>
I
shall
show
these
paper
to
the

as
soon
as
he
be
fit
to
peruse
them
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
that
he
will
be
ready
to
take
my
view
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
assurance
relieve
Luca
Lomi
of
a
great
weight
of
anxiety
.
<EOS>
He
bow
and
withdraw
.
  
<EOS>
the
doctor

the
paper
in
the
same
cabinet
in
which
he

He

one

<EOS>
the
merry

and
the
lively
note
of
the

be

distinctly
across

at
lustily
by

offing

"
I

say
D'Arbino

<EOS>
"
but
I
have
no

so
near

<EOS>
It
be
too
soon

thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
with
that
simple
action
the
work
that
we
have
work
at
together
so
carefully
and
so
long
come
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
We
be
both
so
silent
and
still
,
that
the
murmuring
of
the
tree
in
the
night
air
sound
audibly
and
solemnly
in
our
room
.
  
<EOS>
William
's
collection
of
story
have
not
,
thus
far
,
be
half
exhausted
yet
;
but
those
who
understand
the
public
taste
and
the
interest
of
bookselle
better
than
we
,
think
it
advisable
not
to
risk
offer
too
much
to
the
reader
at
first
.
<EOS>
if
individual
opinion
can
be
accept
as
a
fair
test
,
our
prospect
of
success
seem
hopeful
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
(
but
we
must
not
forget
that
he
be
a
friend
)
be
so
pleased
with
the
two
speciman
story
we
send
to
him
,
that
he
take
them
at
once
to
his
friend
,
the
editor
of
the
newspaper
,
who
show
his
appreciation
of
what
he
read
in
a
very
gratifying
manner
.
<EOS>
He
propose
that
William
should
publish
in
the
newspaper
,
on
very
fair
term
,
any
short
anecdote
and
curious
experience
of
his
life
as
a
portrait
-
painter
,
which
may
not
be
important
enough
to
put
into
a
book
.
<EOS>
the
money
which
my
husband
have
gain
from
time
to
time
in
this
way
have
just
suffice
to
pay
our
expense
at
the
farmhouse
up
to
within
the
last
month
;
and
now
our
excellent
friend
here
say
they
will
not
hear
anything
more
from
us
on
the
subject
of
the
rent
until
the
book
be
sell
and
we
have
plenty
of
money
.
<EOS>
this
be
one
great
relief
and
happiness
.
<EOS>
another
,
for
which
I
feel
even
more
grateful
,
be
that
William
's
eye
have
gain
so
much
by
their
long
rest
,
that
even
the
doctor
be
surprised
at
the
progress
he
have
make
.
<EOS>
He
only
put
on
his
green
shade
now
when
he
go
out
into
the
sun
,
or
when
the
candle
be
light
.
<EOS>
His
spirit
be
infinitely
raise
,
and
he
be
begin
to
talk
already
of
the
time
when
he
will
unpack
his
palette
and
brush
,
and
take
to
his
old
portrait
-
paint
occupation
again
.
  
<EOS>
with
all
these
reason
for
be
happy
,
it
seem
unreasonable
and
ungracious
in
me
to
be
feel
sad
,
as
I
do
just
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
,
in
my
own
justification
,
that
it
be
a
mournful
ceremony
to
take
leave
of
an
old
friend
;
and
I
have
take
leave
twice
over
of
the
book
that
have
be
like
an
old
friend
to
me
 
once
when
I
have
write
the
last
word
in
it
,
and
once
again
when
I
see
it
carry
away
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
I
pack
the
manuscript
up
with
my
own
hand
this
morning
,
in
thick
brown
paper
,
waste
a
great
deal
of
sealing
-
wax
<EOS>
,
I
be
afraid
,
in
my
anxiety
to
keep
the
parcel
from
burst
open
in
case
it
should
be
knock
about
on
its
journey
to
town
.
<EOS>
oh
me
,
how
cheap
and
common
it
look
,
in
its
new
form
,
as
I
carry
it
downstairs
!
<EOS>
a
dozen
pair
of
worst
stocking
would
have
make
a
large
parcel
;
and
half
a
crown
's
worth
of
grocery
would
have
weigh
a
great
deal
heavy
.
  
<EOS>
just
as
we
have
do
dinner
the
doctor
and
the
editor
come
in
.
<EOS>
the
first
have
call
to
fetch
the
parcel
 
<EOS>
I
mean
the
manuscript
;
the
second
have
come
out
with
him
to
Appletreewick
for
a
walk
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
farmer
hear
that
the
book
be
to
be
send
to
London
,
he
insist
that
we
should
drink
success
to
it
all
round
.
<EOS>
the
child
,
in
high
glee
,
be
mount
up
on
the
table
,
with
a
glass
of
currant
-
wine
apiece
;
the
rest
of
us
have
ale
;
the
farmer
propose
the
toast
,
and
his
sailor
son
lead
the
cheer
.
<EOS>
We
all
join
in
(
the
child
include
)
,
except
the
editor
 
who
,
be
the
only
important
person
of
the
party
,
could
not
,
I
suppose
,
afford
to
compromise
his
dignity
by
make
a
noise
.
<EOS>
He
be
extremely
polite
,
however
,
in
a
lofty
way
,
to
me
,
wave
his
hand
and
bow
magnificently
every
time
he
speak
.
<EOS>
this
discompose
me
a
little
;
and
I
be
still
more
flurried
when
he
say
that
he
have
write
to
the
London
publisher
that
very
day
,
to
prepare
them
for
the
arrival
of
our
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
they
will
print
it
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
venture
to
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
madam
,
you
may
consider
it
settle
,
"
say
the
editor
,
confidently
.
<EOS>
"
the
letter
be
write
 
the
thing
be
do
.
<EOS>
look
upon
the
book
as
publish
already
;
pray
oblige
me
by
look
upon
the
book
as
publish
already
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
the
only
uncertainty
now
be
about
how
the
public
will
receive
it
!
"
<EOS>
say
my
husband
,
fidget
in
his
chair
,
and
look
nervously
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
just
so
,
my
dear
sir
,
just
so
,
"
answer
the
editor
.
<EOS>
"
everything
depend
upon
the
public
 
everything
,
I
pledge
you
my
word
of
honor
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
look
doubtful
,
Mrs.
Kerby
;
there
be
not
a
doubt
about
it
,
"
whisper
the
kind
doctor
,
give
the
manuscript
a
confident
smack
as
he
pass
by
me
with
it
on
his
way
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
in
another
minute
he
and
the
editor
,
and
the
poor
cheap
-
look
brown
paper
parcel
,
be
go
.
<EOS>
the
other
follow
them
out
,
and
I
be
leave
in
the
hall
alone
.
  
<EOS>
oh
,
Public
!
<EOS>
public
!
<EOS>
it
all
depend
now
upon
you
!
<EOS>
the
child
be
to
have
new
clothe
from
top
to
toe
;
I
be
to
have
a
black
silk
gown
;
William
be
to
buy
a
beautiful
travel
color
-
box
;
the
rent
be
to
be
pay
;
all
our
kind
friend
at
the
farmhouse
be
to
have
little
present
,
and
our
future
way
in
this
hard
world
be
to
be
smooth
for
us
at
the
outset
,
if
you
will
only
accept
a
poor
painter
's
story
which
his
wife
have
write
down
for
him
after
Dark
!
