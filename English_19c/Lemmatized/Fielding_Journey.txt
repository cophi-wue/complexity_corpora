<EOS>
chapter
<EOS>
I
the
author
die
,
meet
with
Mercury
,
and
be
by
him
conduct
to
the
stage
which
set
out
for
the
other
world
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
first
day
of
December
1741[1
]
I
depart
this
life
at
my
lodging
in
Cheapside
.
<EOS>
My
body
have
be
some
time
dead
before
I
be
at
liberty
to
quit
it
,
lest
it
should
by
any
accident
return
to
life
:
this
be
an
injunction
impose
on
all
soul
by
the
eternal
law
of
fate
,
to
prevent
the
inconvenience
which
would
follow
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
destine
period
be
expire
(
be
no
longer
than
till
the
body
be
become
perfectly
cold
and
stiff
)
<EOS>
I
begin
to
move
;
but
find
myself
under
a
difficulty
of
make
my
escape
,
for
the
mouth
or
door
be
shut
,
so
that
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
go
out
at
it
;
and
the
window
,
vulgarly
call
the
eye
,
be
so
closely
pull
down
by
the
finger
of
a
nurse
,
that
I
could
by
no
mean
open
them
.
<EOS>
at
last
I
perceive
a
beam
of
light
glimmer
at
the
top
of
the
house
(
for
such
I
may
call
the
body
I
have
be
inclose
in
)
,
whither
ascending
<EOS>
,
I
gently
let
myself
down
through
a
kind
of
chimney
,
and
issue
out
at
the
nostril
.
  
<EOS>
[

]
some
doubt
whether
this
should
not
be
rather
1641
,
which
be
a
date
more
agreeable
to
the
account
give
of
it
in
the
introduction
:
<EOS>
but
then
there
be
some
passage
which
seem
to
relate
to
transaction
infinitely
later
,
even
within
this
year
or
two
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
there
be
difficulty
attend
either
conjecture
;
so
the
reader
may
take
which
he
please
.
  
<EOS>
no
prisoner
discharge
from
a
long
confinement
ever
taste
the
sweet
of
liberty
with
a
more
exquisite
relish
than
I
enjoy
in
this
delivery
from
a
dungeon
wherein
I
have
be
detain
upwards
of
forty
year
,
and
with
much
the
same
kind
of
regard
I
cast
my
eyes[2
]
backwards
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
[

eye
be
not
perhaps
so
properly
adapt
to
a
spiritual
substance
;
but
we
be
here
,
as
in
many
other
place
,
oblige
to
use
corporeal
term
to
make
ourselves
the
better
understand
.
   
<EOS>
My
friend
and
relation
have
all
quit
the
room
,
be
all
(
as
I
plainly
overhear
)
very
loudly
quarrel
below
stair
about
my
will
;
there
be
only
an
old
woman
leave
above
to
guard
the
body
,
as
I
apprehend
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
a
fast
sleep
,
occasion
,
as
from
her
savor
it
seem
,
by
a
comfortable
dose
of
gin
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
pleasure
in
this
company
,
and
,
therefore
,
as
the
window
be
wide
open
,
I
sally
forth
into
the
open
air
:
but
,
to
my
great
astonishment
,
find
myself
unable
to
fly
,
<EOS>
which
I
have
always
during
my
habitation
in
the
body
conceive
of
spirit
;
however
,
I
come
so
lightly
to
the
ground
that
I
do
not
hurt
myself
;
and
,
though
I
have
not
the
gift
of
fly
(
<EOS>
owe
probably
to
my
have
neither
feather
nor
wing
)
<EOS>
,
I
be
capable
of
hop
such
a
prodigious
way
at
once
,
that
it
serve
my
turn
almost
as
well
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
hop
far
before
I
perceive
a
tall
young
gentleman
in
a
silk
waistcoat
,
with
a
wing
on
his
left
heel
,
a
garland
on
his
head
,
and
a
caduceus
in
his
right
hand.[3
]
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
see
this
person
before
,
but
have
not
time
to
recollect
where
,
when
he
call
out
to
me
and
ask
me
how
long
I
have
be
depart
.
<EOS>
I
answer
I
be
just
come
forth
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
stay
here
,
"
reply
he
,
"
unless
you
have
be
murder
:
in
which
case
,
indeed
,
you
may
have
be
suffer
to
walk
some
time
;
but
if
you
die
a
natural
death
you
must
set
out
for
the
other
world
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
I
desire
to
know
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
o
,
"
cry
the
gentleman
,
"
I
will
show
you
to
the
inn
whence
the
stage
proceed
;
for
I
be
the
porter
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
never
hear
of
me
 
<EOS>
my
name
be
Mercury
.
"
<EOS>
"
sure
,
sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
have
see
you
at
the
play-
house
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
upon
which
he
smile
,
and
,
without
satisfy
me
as
to
that
point
,
walk
directly
forward
,
bid
me
hop
after
him
.
<EOS>
I
obey
him
,
and
soon
find
myself
in
Warwick
-
lane
;
where
Mercury
,
make
a
full
stop
,
point
at
a
particular
house
,
where
he
bid
me
enquire
for
the
stage
,
and
,
wish
me
a
good
journey
,
take
his
leave
,
say
he
must
go
seek
after
other
customer
.
  
<EOS>
[

this
be
the
dress
in
which
the
god
appear
to
mortal
at
the
theater
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
office
attribute
to
this
god
by
the
ancient
,
be
to
collect
the
ghost
as
a
shepherd
doth
a
flock
of
sheep
,
and
drive
them
with
his
wand
into
the
other
world
.
  
<EOS>
I
arrive
just
as
the
coach
be
set
out
,
and
find
I
have
no
reason
for
inquiry
;
for
every
person
seem
to
know
my
business
the
moment
I
appear
at
the
door
:
the
coachman
tell
me
his
horse
be
to
,
but
that
he
have
no
place
leave
;
however
,
though
there
be
already
six
,
the
passenger
offer
to
make
room
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
thank
them
,
and
ascend
without
much
ceremony
.
<EOS>
We
immediately
begin
our
journey
,
be
seven
in
number
;
for
,
as
the
woman
wear
no
hoop
,
three
of
them
be
but
equal
to
two
man
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
reader
,
thou
mayest
be
pleased
with
an
account
of
this
whole
equipage
,
as
peradventure
thou
wilt
not
,
while
alive
,
see
any
such
.
<EOS>
the
coach
be
make
by
an
eminent
toyman
,
who
be
well
known
to
deal
in
immaterial
substance
,
that
be
the
matter
of
which
it
be
compound
.
<EOS>
the
work
be
so
extremely
fine
,
that
it
be
entirely
invisible
to
the
human
eye
.
<EOS>
the
horse
which
draw
this
extraordinary
vehicle
be
all
spiritual
,
as
well
as
the
passenger
.
<EOS>
They
have
,
indeed
,
all
die
in
the
service
of
a
certain
postmaster
;
and
as
for
the
coachman
,
who
be
a
very
thin
piece
of
immaterial
substance
,
he
have
the
honor
while
alive
of
drive
the
Great
Peter
,
or
Peter
the
Great
,
in
whose
service
his
soul
,
as
well
as
body
,
be
almost
starve
to
death
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
vehicle
in
which
I
set
out
,
and
now
,
those
who
be
not
willing
to
travel
on
with
me
may
,
if
they
please
,
stop
here
;
those
who
be
,
must
proceed
to
the
subsequent
chapter
,
in
which
this
journey
be
continue
.
   
<EOS>
chapter
II
in
which
the
author
first
refute
some
idle
opinion
concern
spirit
,
and
then
the
passenger
relate
their
several
death
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
common
opinion
that
spirit
,
like
owl
,
can
see
in
the
dark
;
<EOS>
nay
,
and
can
then
most
easily
be
perceive
by
other
.
<EOS>
for
which
reason
,
many
person
of
good
understanding
,
to
prevent
be
terrify
with
such
object
,
usually
keep
a
candle
burn
by
them
,
that
the
light
may
prevent
their
seeing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Locke
,
in
direct
opposition
to
this
,
hath
not
doubt
to
assert
that
you
may
see
a
spirit
in
open
daylight
full
as
well
as
in
the
dark
night
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
dark
when
we
set
out
from
the
inn
,
nor
could
we
see
any
more
than
if
every
soul
of
us
have
be
alive
.
<EOS>
We
have
travel
a
good
way
before
any
one
offer
to
open
his
mouth
;
indeed
,
most
of
the
company
be
fast
asleep,[4
]
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
could
not
close
my
own
eye
,
and
perceive
the
spirit
who
sit
opposite
to
me
to
be
likewise
awake
,
I
begin
to
make
overture
of
conversation
,
by
complain
how
DARK
it
be
.
"
<EOS>
and
extremely
cold
too
,
"
answer
my
fellow
traveler
;
"
<EOS>
though
,
I
thank
God
,
as
I
have
no
body
,
I
feel
no
inconvenience
from
it
:
but
you
will
believe
,
sir
,
that
this
frosty
air
must
seem
very
sharp
to
one
just
issue
forth
out
of
an
oven
;
for
such
be
the
inflamed
habitation
I
be
lately
depart
from
.
"
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
come
to
your
end
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
say
I.
<EOS>
"
I
be
murder
,
sir
,
"
answer
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
surprised
then
,
"
reply
I
,
"
that
you
do
not
divert
yourself
by
walk
up
and
down
and
play
some
merry
trick
with
the
murderer
.
"
<EOS>
"
oh
,
sir
,
"
return
he
,
"
I
have
not
that
privilege
,
I
be
lawfully
put
to
death
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
a
physician
set
me
on
fire
,
by
give
me
medicine
to
throw
out
my
distemper
.
<EOS>
I
die
of
a
hot
regiman
,
as
they
call
it
,
in
the
small
-
pox
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
[
4
]
those
who
have
read
of
the
god
sleep
in
Homer
will
not
be
surprised
at
this
happen
to
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
the
spirit
at
that
word
start
up
and
cry
out
,
"
<EOS>
the
small
-
pox
!
bless
me
!
<EOS>
I
hope
I
be
not
in
company
with
that
distemper
,
which
I
have
all
my
life
with
such
caution
avoid
,
and
have
so
happily
escape
hitherto
!
"
<EOS>
this
fright
set
all
the
passenger
who
be
awake
into
a
loud
laughter
;
and
the
gentleman
,
recollect
himself
,
with
some
confusion
,
and
not
without
blush
,
ask
pardon
,
cry
,
"
I
protest
I
dream
that
I
be
alive
.
"
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
die
of
that
distemper
,
which
therefore
make
so
strong
an
impression
on
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
,
"
answer
he
,
"
I
never
have
it
in
my
life
;
but
the
continual
and
dreadful
apprehension
it
keep
me
so
long
under
can
not
,
I
see
,
be
so
immediately
eradicate
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
<EOS>
sir
,
I
avoid
come
to
London
for
thirty
year
together
,
for
fear
of
the
small
-
pox
,
till
the
most
urgent
business
bring
me
thither
about
five
day
ago
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
dreadfully
afraid
of
this
disease
that
I
refuse
the
second
night
of
my
arrival
to
sup
with
a
friend
whose
wife
have
recover
of
it
several
month
before
,
and
the
same
evening
get
a
surfeit
by
eat
too
many
muscle
,
which
bring
me
into
this
good
company
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
lay
a
wager
,
"
cry
the
spirit
who
sit
next
him
,
"
there
be
not
one
in
the
coach
able
to
guess
my
distemper
.
<EOS>
"
I
desire
the
favor
of
him
to
acquaint
us
with
it
,
if
it
be
so
uncommon
.
<EOS>
"
why
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
die
of
honor
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
honor

sir
!
"
<EOS>
repeat
I
,
with
some
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
"
answer
the
spirit
,
"
of
honor
,
for
I
be
kill
in
a
duel

"
  
<EOS>
"
for
my
part

say
a
fair
spirit
,
"
I
be
inoculate
last
summer
,
and
have
the
good
fortune
to
escape
with
a
very
few
mark
on
my
face
.
<EOS>
I
esteem
myself
now
perfectly
happy
,
as
I
imagine
I
have
no
restraint
to
a
full
enjoyment
of
the
diversion
of
the
town
;
but
within
a
few
day
after
my
come
up
I
catch
cold
by
overdance
myself
at
a
ball
,
and
last
night
die
of
a
violent
fever
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
a
short
silence
which
now
ensue
,
the
fair
spirit
who
speak
last
,
it
be
now
daylight
,
address
herself
to
a
female
who
sit
next
her
,
and
ask
her
to
what
chance
they
owe
the
happiness
of
her
company
.
<EOS>
She
answer
,
she
apprehend
to
a
consumption
,
but
the
physician
be
not
agree
concern
her
distemper
,
for
she
leave
two
of
them
in
a
very
hot
dispute
about
it
when
she
come
out
of
her
body
.
"
<EOS>
and
pray
,
madam
,
"
say
the
same
spirit
to
the
sixth
passenger
,
"
how
come
you
to
leave
the
other
world
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
that
female
spirit
,
screw
up
her
mouth
,
answer
,
she
wonder
at
the
curiosity
of
some
people
;
that
perhaps
person
have
already
hear
some
report
of
her
death
,
which
be
far
from
be
true
;
that
,
whatever
be
the
occasion
of
it
,
she
be
glad
at
be
deliver
from
a
world
in
which
she
have
no
pleasure
,
and
where
there
be
nothing
but
nonsense
and
impertinence
;
particularly
among
her
own
sex
,
whose
loose
conduct
<EOS>
she
have
long
be
entirely
ashamed
of
.
  
<EOS>
the
beauteous
spirit
,
perceive
her
question
give
offense
,
pursue
it
no
farther
.
<EOS>
She
have
indeed
all
the
sweetness
and
good
-
humor
which
be
so
extremely
amiable
(
when
find
)
<EOS>
in
that
sex
which
tenderness
most
exquisitely
become
.
<EOS>
Her
countenance
display
all
the
cheerfulness
,
the
good
-
nature
,
and
the
modesty
,
which
diffuse
such
brightness
round
the
beauty
of
Seraphina,[5
]
awe
every
beholder
with
respect
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
ravish
him
with
admiration
.
<EOS>
have
it
not
be
indeed
for
our
conversation
on
the
small
-
pox
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
imagine
we
have
be
honor
with
her
identical
presence
.
<EOS>
this
opinion
may
have
be
heighten
by
the
good
sense
she
utter
whenever
she
speak
,
by
the
delicacy
of
her
sentiment
,
and
the
complacence
of
her
behavior
,
together
with
a
certain
dignity
which
attend
every
look
,
word
,
and
gesture
;
quality
which
could
not
fail
make
an
impression
on
a
heart[6
]
<EOS>
so
capable
of
receive
it
as
mine
,
nor
be
she
long
in
raise
in
me
a
very
violent
degree
of
seraphic
love
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
intend
by
this
,
that
sort
of
love
which
man
be
very
properly
say
to
make
to
woman
in
the
low
world
,
and

I
mean
by
seraphic
love
an
extreme
delicacy
and
tenderness
of
friendship
,
of
which
,
my
worthy

,
if
thou

no

as
it

probable

mayest
not

my
endeavor

would
be

fruitless

We
have
before
make
an
apology
for
this
language
,
which
we
here
repeat
for
the
last
time
;
though
the
heart
may
,
we
hope
,
be
metaphorically
use
here
with
more
propriety
than
when
we
apply
those
passion
to
the
body
which
belong
to
the
soul
.
  
<EOS>
to
return
therefore
to
matter
comprehensible
by
all
understanding
:
the
discourse
now
turn
on
the
vanity
,
folly
,
and
misery
of
the
low
world
,
from
which
every
passenger
in
the
coach
express
the
high
satisfaction
in
be
deliver
;
though
it
be
very
remarkable
that
,
notwithstanding
the
joy
we
declare
at
our
death
,
there
be
not
one
of
us
who
do
not
mention
the
accident
which
occasion
it
as
a
thing
we
would
have
avoid
if
we
could
.
<EOS>
nay
,
the
very
grave
lady
herself
,
who
be
the
forward
in
testify
her
delight
,
confess
inadvertently
that
she
leave
a
physician
by
her
bedside
;
and
the
gentleman
who
die
of
honor
very
liberally
curse
both
his
folly
and
his
fencing
.
<EOS>
while
we
be
entertain
ourselves
with
these
matter
,
on
a
sudden
a
most
offensive
smell
begin
to
invade
our
nostril
.
<EOS>
this
very
much
resemble
the
savor
which
traveler
in
summer
perceive
at
their
approach
to
that
beautiful
village
of
the
Hague
,
arise
from
those
delicious
canal
which
,
as
they
consist
of
stand
water
,
do
at
that
time
emit
odor
greatly
agreeable
to
a
dutch
taste
,
but
not
so
pleasant
to
any
other
.
<EOS>
those
perfume
,
with
the
assistance
of
a
fair
wind
,
begin
to
affect
person
of
quick
olfactory
nerve
at
a
league
's
distance
,
and
increase
gradually
as
you
approach
.
<EOS>
in
the
same
manner
do
the
smell
I
have
just
mention
,
more
and
more
invade
us
,
till
one
of
the
spirit
,
look
out
of
the
coach
-
window
,
declare
we
be
just
arrive
at
a
very
large
city
;
and
indeed
he
have
scarce
say
so
before
we
find
ourselves
in
the
suburb
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
coachman
,
be
ask
by
another
,
inform
us
that
the
name
of
this
place
be
the
City
of
Diseases
.
<EOS>
the
road
to
it
be
extremely
smooth
,
and
,
except
the
above
-
mention
savor
,
delightfully
pleasant
.
<EOS>
the
street
of
the
suburb
be
line
with
bagnio
,
tavern
,
and
cook
'
shop
:
in
the
first
we
see
several
beautiful
woman
,
but
in
tawdry
dress
,
look
out
at
the
window
;
and
in
the
latter
be
visibly
expose
all
kind
of
the
rich
dainty
;
but
on
our
enter
the
city
we
find
,
contrary
to
all
we
have
see
in
the
other
world
,
that
the
suburb
be
infinitely
pleasant
than
the
city
itself
.
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
a
very
dull
,
dark
,
and
melancholy
place
.
<EOS>
few
people
appear
in
the
street
,
and
these
,
for
the
most
part
,
be
old
woman
,
and
here
and
there
a
formal
grave
gentleman
,
who
seem
to
be
think
,
with
large
tie
-
wig
on
,
and
amber
-
head
cane
in
their
hand
.
<EOS>
We
be
all
in
hope
that
our
vehicle
would
not
stop
here
;
but
,
to
our
sorrow
,
the
coach
soon
drive
into
an
inn

chapter

<EOS>
the
adventure
we
meet
with
in
the
City
of
Diseases
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
not
be
long
arrive
in
our
inn
,
where
it
seem
we
be
to
spend
the
remainder
of
the
day
,
before
our
host
acquaint
us
that
it
be
customary
for
all
spirit
,
in
their
passage
through
that
city
,
to
pay
their
respect
to
that
lady
Disease
,
to
whose
assistance
they
have
owe
their
deliverance
from
the
low
world
.
<EOS>
We
answer
we
should
not
fail
in
any
complacence
which
be
usual
to
other
;
upon
which
our
host
reply
he
would
immediately
send
porter
to
conduct
us
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
long
quit
the
room
before
we
be
attend
by
some
of
those
grave
person
whom
I
have
before
describe
in
large
tie
-
wig
with
amber
-
head
cane
.
<EOS>
these
gentleman
be
the
ticket
-
porter
in
the
city
,
and
their
cane
be
the
insignia
,
or
ticket
,
denote
their
office
.
<EOS>
We
inform
them
of
the
several
lady
to
whom
we
be
oblige
,
and
be
prepare
to
follow
them
,
when
on
a
sudden
they
all
stare
at
one
another
,
and
leave
us
in
a
hurry
,
with
a
frown
on
every
countenance
.
<EOS>
We
be
surprised
at
this
behavior
,
and
presently
summon
the
host
,
who
be
no
sooner
acquaint
with
it
than
he
burst
into
an
hearty
laugh
,
and
tell
us
the
reason
be
,
because
we
do
not
fee
the
gentleman
the
moment
they
come
in
,
accord
to
the
custom
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
We
answer
,
with
some
confusion
,
we
have
bring
nothing
with
us
from
the
other
world
,
which
we
have
be
all
our
life
inform
be
not
lawful
to
do
.
"
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
master
,
"
reply
the
host
;
"
I
be
apprise
of
that
,
and
indeed
it
be
my
fault
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
first
send
you
to
my
lord
Scrape,[7
]
who
would
have
supply
you
with
what
you
want
.
"
<EOS>
"
My
lord
scrape
supply
us
!
"
<EOS>
say
I
,
with
astonishment
:
"
<EOS>
sure
you
must
know
we
can
not
give
him
security
;
and
I
be
convince
he
never
lend
a
shilling
without
it
in
his
life
.
"
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
,
"
answer
the
host
,
"
and
for
that
reason
he
be
oblige
to
do
it
here
,
where
he
be
sentence
to
keep
a
bank
,
and
to
distribute
money
gratis
to
all
passenger
.
<EOS>
this
bank
originally
consist
of
just
that
sum
,
which
he
have
miserably
hoard
up
in
the
other
world
,
and
he
be
to
perceive
it
decrease
visibly
one
shill
a
-
day
,
till
it
be
totally
exhausted
;
after
which
he
be
to
return
to
the
other
world
,
and
perform
the
part
of
a
miser
for
seventy
year
;
then
,
be
purify
in
the
body
of
a
hog
,
he
be
to
enter
the
human
specie
again
,
and
take
a
second
trial
.
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
tell
me
wonder
:
but
if
his
bank
be
to
decrease
only
a
shill
a
day
,
how
can
he
furnish
all
passenger
?
"
<EOS>
"
the
rest
,
"
answer
the
host
,
"
be
supply
again
;
but
in
a
manner
which
I
can
not
easily
explain
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
apprehend
,
"
say
I
,
"
this
distribution
of
his
money
be
inflict
on
him
as
a
punishment
;
but
I
do
not
see
how
it
can
answer
that
end
,
when
he
know
it
be
to
be
restore
to
him
again
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
serve
the
purpose
as
well
if
he
part
only
with
the
single
shilling
,
which
it
seem
be
all
he
be
really
to
lose
?
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
cry
the
host
,
"
when
you
observe
the
agony
with
which
he
part
with
every
guinea
,
you
will
be
of
another
opinion
.
<EOS>
no
prisoner
condemn
to
death
ever
beg
so
heartily
for
transportation
as
he
,
when
he
receive
his
sentence
,
do
to
go
to
hell
,
provide
he
may
carry
his
money
with
him
.
<EOS>
but
you
will
know
more
of
these
thing
when
you
arrive
at
the
upper
world
;
and
now
,
if
you
please
,
I
will
attend
you
to
my
lord

who
be
oblige
to

that
we
may
mention
it
once
for
all
,
in
the
panegyrical
part
of
this
work
some
particular
person
be
always
mean
:
<EOS>
but
,
in
the
satirical
,
nobody

<EOS>
We
find
his
lordship
sit
at
the
upper
end
of
a
table
,
on
which
be
an
immense
sum
of
money
,
dispose
in
several
heap
,
every
one
of
which
would
have
purchase
the
honor
of
some
patriot
and
the
chastity
of
some
prude
.
<EOS>
the
moment
he
see
us
he
turn
pale
,
and
sigh
,
as
well
apprehend
our
business
.
<EOS>
mine
host
accost
him
with
a
familiar
air
,
which
at
first
surprise
me
,
who
so
well
remember
the
respect
I
have
formerly
see
pay
this
lord
by
man
infinitely
superior
in
quality
to
the
person
who
now
salute
him
in
the
follow
manner
:
"
here
,
you
lord
,
and
be
dam
 
d
to
your
little

soul

tell
out
your

supply
your
better
with
what
they
want

<EOS>
be
quick

or
I
will
fetch
the
beadle
to
you

<EOS>
do
not
fancy
yourself
in
the
low
world
again
,
with
your
privilege
at
your
a
 
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
shake
a
cane
at
his
lordship
,
who
immediately
begin
to
tell
out
his
money
,
with
the
same
miserable
air
and
face
which
the
miser
on
our
stage
wear
while
he
deliver
his
bank
-
bill
.
<EOS>
this
affect
some
of
us
so
much
that
we
have
certainly
return
with
no
more
than
what
would
have
be
sufficient
to
fee
the
porter
,
have
not
our
host
,
perceive
our
compassion
,
beg
us
not
to
spare
a
fellow
who
,
in
the
midst
of
immense
wealth
,
have
always
refuse
the
least
contribution
to
charity
.
<EOS>
Our
heart
be
harden
with
this
reflection
,
and
we
all
fill
our
pocket
with
his
money
.
<EOS>
I
remark
a
poetical
spirit
,
in
particular
,
who
swear
he
would
have
a
hearty
gripe
at
him
:
"
for

"
say
he
,
"
the
rascal
not
only
refuse
to
subscribe
to
my
work

but
send
back
my
letter
unanswere
,
though
I
be
a
well
gentleman
than
himself

<EOS>
"
We
now
return
from
this
miserable
object
,
greatly
admire
the
propriety
as
well
as
justice
of
his
punishment
,
which
consist
,
as
our
host
inform
us
,
merely
in
the
delivering
forth
his
money
;
and
,
he
observe
,
we
could
not
wonder
at
the
pain
this
give
him
,
since
it
be
as
reasonable
that
the
bare
parting
with
money
should
make
him
miserable
as
that
the
bare
have
money
without

it
should
have
make
him
happy

my

I
give
my

a

blunder
he
make

when
my

with

tell

he

and
march
off
without

He
be

I

another

<EOS>
I
first
fee'd
him

and
then
acquaint
him
with
the
name
of

<EOS>
He
cast
himself
for
two
or
three
minute
into
a
thoughtful
posture
,
then
pull
a
piece
of
paper
out
of
his
pocket
,
on
which
he
write
something
in
one
of
the
oriental
language

I
believe
,
for
I
could
not
read
a
syllable
<EOS>
:
he
bid
me
carry
it
to
such
a
particular
shop

and
,
tell
me
it
would
do
my
business

,
he
take
his
leave

<EOS>
secure
,
as
I
now
think
myself
,
of
my
direction
,
I
go
to
the
shop
,
which
very
much
resemble
an
apothecary
's
.
<EOS>
the
person
who
officiate
,
have
read
the
paper
,
take
down
about
twenty
different
jar
,
and
,
pour
something
out
of
every
one
of
them
,
make
a
mixture

which
he
deliver
to
me
in
a

,
have
first
tie
a

round
the
neck
of
it

on

be
write
three

mention
the

want

but
receive
no
other
answer
than
that
he
have
do
as
he
be
order
,
and
the
drug
be
excellent

<EOS>
I
begin
now
to
be
enrage
,
and
,
quit
the
shop
with
some
anger
in
my
countenance
,
I
intend
to
find
out
my
inn
,
but
,
meet
in
the
way
a
porter
whose
countenance
have
in
it
something
more
pleasing
than
ordinary
,
I
resolve
to
try
once
more
,
and
clap
a
fee
into
his
hand
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
mention
the
disease
to
him
he
laugh
heartily
,
and
tell
me
I
have
be
impose
on
,
for
in
reality
no
such
disease
be

find
in

city

He
then
inquire
into
the
particular
of
my

acquaint

he
inform
me
that
the

the
lady
to

I

<EOS>
I
thank
him
,

the

of
this
lady
be

most

magnificent
in

<EOS>
the
avenue

of
them
maim
,
<EOS>
whence
<EOS>
I
conclude
them
all
to
be
true
antique
;
but
be
inform
they
be
the
figure
of
several
modern
hero
,
who
have
die
martyr
to
her
ladyship
's
cause
.
<EOS>
I
next
mount
through
a
large
paint
staircase
,
where
several
person
be
depict
in
caricatura
;
and
,
upon
inquiry
,
be
tell
they
be
the
portrait
of
those
who
have
distinguish
themselves
against
the
lady
in
the
low
world
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
should
have
know
the
face
of
many
physician
and
surgeon
,
have
they
not
be
so
violently
distort
by
the
painter
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
have
exert
so
much
malice
in
his
work
,
that
I
believe
he
have
himself
receive
some
particular
favor
from
the
lady
of
this
mansion
:
it
be
difficult
to
conceive
a
group
of
strange
figure
.
<EOS>
I
then
enter
a
long
room
,
hang
round
with
the
picture
of
woman
of
such
exact
shape
and
feature
that
I
should
have
think
myself
in
a
gallery
of
beauty
,
have
not
a
certain
sallow
paleness
in
their
complexion
<EOS>
give
me
a
more
distasteful
idea
.
<EOS>
through
this
I
proceed
to
a
second
apartment
,
adorn
,
if
I
may
so
call
it
,
with
the
figure
of
old
lady
.
<EOS>
upon
my
seeming
to
admire
at
this
furniture
,
the
servant
tell
me
with
a
smile
that
these
have
be
very
good
friend
of
his
lady
,
and
have
do
her
eminent
service
in
the
low
world
.
<EOS>
I
immediately
recollect
the
face
of
one
or
two
of
my
acquaintance
,
who
have
formerly
keep
bagnio
;
but
be
very
much
surprised
to
see
the
resemblance
of
a
lady
of
great
distinction
in
such
company
.
<EOS>
the
servant
,
upon
my
mention
this
,
make
no
other
answer
than
that
his
lady
have
picture
of
all
degree
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
introduce
into
the
presence
of
the
lady
herself
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
thin
,
or
rather
meager
,
person
,
very
wan
in
the
countenance
,
have
no
nose
and
many
pimple
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
She
offer
to
rise
at
my
entrance
,
but
could
not
stand
.
<EOS>
after
many
compliment
,
much
congratulation
on
her
side
,
and
the
most
fervent
expression
of
gratitude
on
mine
,
she
ask
me
many
question
concern
the
situation
of
her
affair
in
the
low
world
;
most
of
which
I
answer
to
her
entire
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
with
a
kind
of
force
smile
,
she
say
,
"
I
suppose
the
pill
and
drop
go
on
swimmingly
?
<EOS>
"
I
tell
her
they
be
report
to
have
do
great
cure
.
<EOS>
She
reply
she
could
apprehend
no
danger
from
any
person
who
be
not
of
regular
practice
;
"
for
,
however
simple
mankind
be
,
"
say
she
,
"
or
however
afraid
they
be
of
death
,
they
prefer
die
in
a
regular
manner
to
be
cure
by
a
nostrum
.
"
<EOS>
She
then
express
great
pleasure
at
the
account
I
give
her
of
the
beau
monde
.
<EOS>
She
say
she
have
herself
remove
the
hundred
of
Drury
to
the
hundred
of
Charing
-
cross
,
and
be
very
much
delighted
to
find
they
have
spread
into
St.
James
's
;
that
she
impute
this
chiefly
to
several
of
her
dear
and
worthy
friend
,
who
have
lately
publish
their
excellent
work
,
endeavor
to
extirpate
all
notion
of
religion
and
virtue
;
and
particularly
to
the
deserve
author
of
the
Bachelor
's
Estimate
;
<EOS>
"
to
whom
,
"
say
she
,
"
if
I
have
not
reason
to
think
he
be
a
surgeon
,
and
have
therefore
write
from
mercenary
view
,
I
could
never
sufficiently
own
my
obligation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
speak
likewise
greatly
in
approbation
of
the
method
,
so
generally
use
by
parent
,
of
marry
child
very
young
,
and
without
the
least
affection
between
the
party
;
and
conclude
by
say
that
,
if
these
fashion
continue
to
spread
,
she
doubt
not
but
she
should
shortly
be
the
only
disease
who
would
ever
receive
a
visit
from
any
person
of
considerable
rank
.
  
<EOS>
while
we
be
discourse
her
three
daughter
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
call
by
hard
name
;
the
eld
be
name
Lepra
,
the
second
Chaeras
,
and
the
third
Scorbutia.[8

<EOS>
They
be
all
genteel
,
but
ugly
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
observe
the
little
respect
they
pay
their
parent
,
which
the
old
lady
remarking
in
my
countenance
,
as
soon
as
they
quit
the
room
,
which
soon
happen
,
acquaint
me
with
her
unhappiness
in
her
offspring
,
every
one
of
which
have
the
confidence
to
deny
themselves
to
be
her
child
,
though
she
say
she
have
be
a
very
indulgent
mother
and
have
plentifully
provide
for
them
all
.
<EOS>
as
family
complaint
generally
as
much
tire
the
hearer
as
they
relieve
him
who
make
them
,
when
I
find
her
launch
farther
into
this
subject
<EOS>
I
resolve
to
put
an
end
to
my
visit
,
and
,
take
my
leave
with
many
thank
for
the
favor
she
have
do
me
<EOS>
,
I
return
to
the
inn
,
where
I
find
my
fellow

just
mount
into
their
vehicle

<EOS>
I
shake
hand
with
my
host
and
accompany
them
into

immediately
after
proceed
on
its
journey

<EOS>
chapter
IV
discourse
on
the
road
,
and
a
description
of
the
palace
of
Death
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
all
silent
for
some
minute
,
till
,
be
well
shake
into
our
several
seat
<EOS>
,
I
open
my
mouth
first
,
and
relate
what
have
happen
to
me
after
our
separation
in
the
city
we
have
just

the
grave

our
reader
may
remember
to
have
refuse

an
account
of
the
distemper
which
occasion
her
dissolution
,
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
tedious
to
relate
these
at
large
;
we
shall
therefore
only
mention
a
very
remarkable
inveteracy
which
the
Surfeit
declare
to
all
the
other

especially
to
the
Fever
,
who
,
she
say

by

receive
acknowledgment
from
numberless

which
be
due

indeed

say
she

"
those

"
<EOS>
be
constantly
make
such
mistake
;
there
be
no
gratitude
in
those
fellow
;
for
I
be
sure
they
have
great
obligation
to
me
than
to
any
other
disease
,
except
the
Vapors
.
<EOS>
"
these
relation
be
no
sooner
over
than
one
of
the
company
inform
us
we
be
approach
to
the
most
noble
building
he
have
ever
beheld
,
and
which
we
learn
from
our
coachman
be
the
palace
of
Death
.
<EOS>
Its
outside
,
indeed
,
appear
extremely
magnificent
.
<EOS>
Its
structure
be
of
the
gothic
order
;
vast
beyond
imagination
,
the
whole
pile
consist
of
black
marble
.
<EOS>
row
of
immense
yew
form
an
amphitheater
round
it
of
such
height
and
thickness
that
no
ray
of
the
sun
ever
perforate
this
grove
,
where
black
eternal
darkness
would
reign
<EOS>
be
it
not
exclude
by
innumerable
lamp
which
be
place
in
pyramid
round
the
grove
;
so
that
the
distant
reflection
they
cast
on
the
palace
,
which
be
plentifully
gild
with
gold
on
the
outside
,
be
inconceivably
solemn
.
<EOS>
to
this
I
may
add
the
hollow
murmur
of
wind
constantly
hear
from
the
grove
,
and
the
very
remote
sound
of
roar
water
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
every
circumstance
seem
to
conspire
to
fill
the
mind
with
horror
and
consternation
as
we
approach
to
this
palace
,
which
we
have
scarce
time
to
admire
before
our
vehicle
stop
at
the
gate
,
and
we
be
desire
to
alight
in
order
to
pay
our
respect
to
his
most
mortal
majesty
<EOS>
(
this
be
the
title
which
it
seem
he
assume
)
.
<EOS>
the
outward
court
be
full
of
soldier
,
and
,
indeed
,
the
whole
very
much
resemble
the
state
of
an
earthly
monarch
,
only
more
magnificent
.
<EOS>
We
pass
through
several
court
into
a
vast
hall
,
which
lead
to
a
spacious
staircase
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
stand
two
page
,
with
very
grave
countenance
,
whom
I
recollect
afterwards
to
have
formerly
be
very
eminent
undertaker
,
and
be
in
reality
the
only
dismal
face
I
see
here
;
for
this
palace
,
so
awful
and
tremendous
without
,
be
all
gay
and
sprightly
within
;
so
that
we
soon
lose
all
those
dismal
and
gloomy
idea
we
have
contract
in
approach
it
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
still
silence
maintain
among
the
guard
and
attendant
resemble
rather
the
stately
pomp
of
eastern
court
;
but
there
be
on
every
face
such
symptom
of
content
and
happiness
that
diffuse
an
air
of
cheerfulness
all
round
.
<EOS>
We
ascend
the
staircase
and
pass
through
many
noble
apartment
whose
wall
be
adorn
with
various
battle
-
piece
in
tapistry
,
and
which
we
spend
some
time
in
observing
.
<EOS>
these
bring
to
my
mind
those
beautiful
one
I
have
in
my
lifetime
see
at
Blenheim
,
nor
could
I
prevent
my
curiosity
from
inquire
where
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
's
victory
be
place
(
for
I
think
they
be
almost
the
only
battle
of
any
eminence
I
have
read
of
which
I
do
not
meet
with
)
;
when
the
skeleton
of
a
beef
-
eater
,
shake
his
head
,
tell
me
a
certain
gentleman
,
one
Lewis
XIV
,
who
have
great
interest
with
his
most
mortal
majesty
,
have
prevent
any
such
from
be
hang
up
there
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
besides
,
"
say
he
,
"
his
majesty
hath
<EOS>
no
great
respect
for
that
duke
<EOS>
,
for
he
never
send
him
a
subject
he
could
keep
from
him
,
nor
do
he
ever
get
a
single
subject
by
his

but
he
lose
1000
other
for

<EOS>
"
We
find
the
presence
-
chamber
at
our
entrance
very
full
,
and
a
buzz
run
through
it
,
as
in
all
assembly
,
before
the
principal
figure
enter
;
for
his
majesty
be
not
yet
come
out

<EOS>
at
the
bottom
of
the
room
be
two
person
in
close
conference

one
with
a
square
black
cap
on
his
head
,
and
the
other
with
a
robe
embroider
with
flame
of
fire
.
<EOS>
these
,
I
be
inform
,
be
a
judge
long
since
dead
,
and
an
inquisitor
-
general
.
<EOS>
I
overhear
them
dispute
with
great
eagerness
whether
the
one
have
hang
or
the
other
burn
the
most
.
<EOS>
while
I
be
listen
to
this
dispute
,
which
seem
to
be
in
no
likelihood
of
a
speedy
decision
,
the
emperor
enter
the
room
and
place
himself
between
two
figure
,
one
of
which
be
remarkable
for
the
roughness
,
and
the
other
for
the
beauty
of
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
these
be
,
it
seem
,
Charles
XII
of
Sweden
and
Alexander
of
Macedon
.
<EOS>
I
be
at
too
great
a
distance
to
hear
any
of
the
conversation
,
so
could
only
satisfy
my
curiosity
by
contemplate
the
several
personage
present
,
of
whose
name
I
inform
myself
by
a
page
,
who
look
as
pale
and
meager
as
any
court
-
page
in
the
other
world
,
but
be
somewhat
more
modest
.
<EOS>
He
show
me
here
two
or
three
turkish
emperor
,
to
whom
his
most
mortal
majesty
seem
to
express
much
civility
.
<EOS>
here
be
likewise
several
of
the
roman
emperor
,
among
whom
none
seem
so
much
caress
as
Caligula
,
on
account
,
as
the
page
tell
me
,
of
his
pious
wish
that
he
could
send
all
the
Romans
hither
at
one
blow
.
<EOS>
the
reader
may
be
perhaps
surprised
that
I
see
no
physician
here
;
as
indeed
I
be
myself
,
till
inform
that
they
be
all
depart
to
the
city
of
Diseases
,
where
they
be
busy
in
an
experiment
to
purge
away
the
immortality
of
the
soul
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
tedious
to
recollect
the
many
individual
I
see
here
,
but
I
can
not
omit
a
fat
figure
,
well
dressed
in
the
french
fashion
,
who
be
receive
with
extraordinary
complacence
by
the
emperor

and
whom
I
imagine
to
be
Lewis

himself
;
but
the
page
acquaint
me
<EOS>
he
be
a
celebrated
french
cook
.
<EOS>
We
be
at
length
introduce
to
the
royal
presence
,
and
have
the
honor
to
kiss
hand
.
<EOS>
His
majesty
ask
us
a
few
question
,
not
very
material
to
relate
,
and
soon
after
retire
.
<EOS>
when
we
return
into
the
yard
we
find
our
caravan
ready
to
set
out
,
at
which
we
all
declare
ourselves
well
pleased
;
for
we
be
sufficiently
tired
with
the
formality
of
a
court

notwithstanding
its
outward
splendor
and
magnificence

proceed
on
their
journey

and
meet
several
spirit
who
be
come
into
the
flesh

<EOS>
We
now
come
to
the
bank
of
the
great
river
Cocytus
,
where
we
quit
our
vehicle
,
and
pass
the
water
in
a
boat
,
after
which
we
be
oblige
to
travel
on
foot
the
rest
of

now
we
meet
,
for
the
first

several
passenger
travel
to
the

we
have
leave

who
inform

they
be

<EOS>
the
two
first
we
meet
be
walk
arm

in

arm
,
in
very
close
and
friendly
conference
;
they
inform
us
that
one
of
them
be
intend
for
a
duke
,
and
the
other
for
a
hackney
-
coachman
.
<EOS>
as
we
have
not
yet
arrive
at
the
place
where
we
be
to
deposit
our
passion
,
we
be
all
surprised
at
the
familiarity
which
subsist
between
person
of
such
different
degree
;
nor
could
the
grave
lady
help
express
her
astonishment
at
it
.
<EOS>
the
future
coachman
then
reply
,
with
a
laugh
,
that
they
have
exchange
lot
;
for
that
the
duke
have
with
his
dukedom
draw
a
shrew
for
a
wife
,
and
the
coachman
only
a
single
state
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
proceed
on
our
journey
we
meet
a
solemn
spirit
walk
alone
with
great
gravity
in
his
countenance
:
our
curiosity
invite
us
,
notwithstanding
his
reserve
,
to
ask
what
lot
he
have
draw
.
  
<EOS>
He
answer
,
with
a
smile
,
he
be
to
have
the
reputation
of
a
wise
man
with
L100,000
in
his
pocket
,
and
be
practice
the
solemnity
which
he
be
to
act
in
the
other
world
.
<EOS>
a
little
farther
we
meet
a
company
of
very
merry
spirit
,
whom
we
imagine
by
their
mirth
to
have
draw
some
mighty
lot
,
but
,
on
inquiry
,
they
inform
us
they
be
to
be
beggar

<EOS>
the
farther
we
advance
,
the
great
number
we
meet
;
and
now
we
discover
two
large
road
lead
different
way
,
and
of
very
different
appearance
;
the
one
all
craggy
with
rock
,
full
as
it
seem
of
boggy
ground
,
and
everywhere
beset
with
briar
,
so
that
it
be
impossible
to
pass
through
it
without
the
utmost
danger
and
difficulty
;
the
other
,
the
most
delightful
imaginable
,
lead
through
the
most
verdant
meadow
,
paint
and
perfume
with
all
kind
of
beautiful
flower
;
in
short
,
the
most
wanton
imagination
could
imagine
nothing
more
lovely
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
which
,
we
be
surprised
to
see
great
number
crowd
into
the
former
,
and
only
one
or
two
solitary
spirit
choose
the
latter
.
  
<EOS>
on
inquiry
,
we
be
acquaint
that
the
bad
road
be
the
way
to
greatness
,
and
the
other
to
goodness
.
<EOS>
when
we
express
our
surprise
at
the
preference
give
to
the
former
we
be
acquaint
that
it
be
choose
for
the
sake
of
the
music
of
drum
and
trumpet
,
and
the
perpetual
acclamation
of
the
mob
,
with
which
those
who
travel
this
way
be
constantly
salute
.
<EOS>
We
be
tell
likewise
that
there
be
several
noble
palace
to
be
see
,
and
lodge
in
,
on
this
road
,
by
those
who
have
pass
through
the
difficulty
of
it
(
which
indeed
many
be
not
able
to
surmount
)
,
and
great
quantity
of
all
sort
of
treasure
to
be
find
in
it
;
whereas
the
other
have
little
invite
more
than
the
beauty
of
the
way
,
scarce
a
handsome
building
,
save
one
greatly
resemble
a
certain
house
by
the
Bath
,
to
be
see
during
that
whole
journey
;
and
,
lastly
,
that
it
be
think
very
scandalous
and
mean
-
spirited
to
travel
through
this
,
and
as
highly
honorable
and
noble
to
pass
by
the
other
.
<EOS>
We
now
hear
a
violent
noise
,
when
,
cast
our
eye
forwards
,
we
perceive
a
vast
number
of
spirit
advance
in
pursuit
of
one
whom
they
mock
and
insult
with
all
kind
of
scorn
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
give
my
reader
a
more
adequate
idea
of
this
scene
than
by
compare
it
to
an
english
mob
conduct
a
pickpocket
to
the
water
;
or
by
suppose
that
an
incensed
audience
at
a
playhouse
have
unhappily
possess
themselves
of
the
miserable
damned
poet
.
<EOS>
some
laugh
,
some
hiss
,
some
squall
,
some
groan
,
some
bawl
,
some
spit
at
him
,
some
throw
dirt
at
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
not
to
ask
who
or
what
the
wretched
spirit
be
whom
they
treat
in
this
barbarous
manner
;
when
,
to
our
great
surprise
,
we
be
inform
that
it
be
a
king
:
we
be
likewise
tell
that
this
manner
of
behavior
be
usual
among
the
spirit
to
those
who
draw
the
lot
of
emperor
,
king
,
and
other
great
man
,
not
from
envy
or
anger
,
but
mere
derision
and
contempt
of
earthly
grandeur
;
that
nothing
be
more
common
than
for
those
who
have
draw
these
great
prize
(
as
to
us
they
seem
)
to
exchange
them
with
tailor
and
cobbler
;
and
that
Alexander
the
Great
and
Diogenes
have
formerly
do
so
;
he
that
be
afterwards
<EOS>
diogene
have
originally
fall
on
the
lot
of
Alexander
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
on
a
sudden
,
the
mockery
cease
,
and
the
king
-
spirit
,
have
obtain
a
hearing
,
begin
to
speak
as
follow
;
for
we
be
now
near
enough
to
hear
him
distinctly
:
    
"
GENTLEMEN
,
 
<EOS>
I
be
justly
surprised
at
your
treat
me
in
this
manner
,
<EOS>
since
whatever
lot
I
have
draw
,
I
do
not
choose
:
if
,
therefore
,
it
be
worthy
of
derision
,
you
should
compassionate
me
,
for
it
may
have
fall
to
any
of
your
share
.
<EOS>
I
know
in
how
low
a
light
<EOS>
the
station
to
which
fate
<EOS>
hath
assign
me
be
consider
here
,
and
that
,
when
ambition
doth
not
support
it
,
it
become
generally
so
intolerable
,
that
there
be
scarce
any
other
condition
for
which
it
be
not
gladly
exchange
:
for
what
portion
,
in
the
world
to
which
we
be
go
,
be
so
miserable
as
that
of
care
?
<EOS>
Should
I
therefore
consider
myself
as
become
by
this
lot
essentially
your
superior
,
and
of
a
high
order
of
be
than
the
rest
of
my
fellow
-
creature
;
should
I
foolishly
imagine
myself
without
wisdom
superior
to
the
wise
,
without
knowledge
to
the
learn
,
without
courage
to
the
brave
,
and
without
goodness
and
virtue
to
the
good
and
virtuous
;
surely
so
preposterous
,
so
absurd
a
pride
,
would
justly
render
me
the
object
of
ridicule
.
<EOS>
but
far
be
it
from
me
to
entertain
it
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
gentleman
,
I
prize
the
lot
I
have
draw
,
nor
would
I
exchange
it
with
any
of
yours
,
see
it
be
in
my
eye
so
much
great
than
the
rest
.
<EOS>
ambition
,
which
I
own
myself
possess
of
,
teach
me
this
;
ambition
,
which
make
me
covet
praise
,
assure
me
that
I
shall
enjoy
a
much
large
proportion
of
it
than
can
fall
within
your
power
either
to
deserve
or
obtain
.
<EOS>
I
be
then
superior
to
you
all
,
when
I
be
able
to
do
more
good
,
and
when
I
execute
that
power
.
<EOS>
what
the
father
be
to
the
son
,
the
guardian
to
the
orphan
,
or
the
patron
to
his

<EOS>
You
be
my
child
,
to
whom
I
will
be
a
father
,
a
guardian
,
and
a
patron
.
<EOS>
not
one
evening
in
my
long
reign
(
for
so
it
be
to
be
)
will
I
repose
myself
to
rest
without
the
glorious
,
the
heart
-
warm
consideration
,
that
thousand
that
night
owe
their
sweetest
rest
to
me
.
<EOS>
what
a
delicious
fortune
be
it
to
him
whose
strong
appetite
be
do
good
,
to
have
every
day
the
opportunity
and
the
power
of
satisfy
it
!
<EOS>
if
such
a
man
hath
ambition
,
how
happy
be
it
for
him
to
be
seat
so
on
high
,
that
every
act
blaze
abroad
,
and
attract
to
him
praise
taint
with
neither
sarcasm
nor
adulation
,
but
such
as
the
nice
and
most
delicate
mind
may
relish
!
<EOS>
thus
,
therefore
,
while
you
derive
your
good
from
me
,
I
be
your
superior
.
<EOS>
if
to
my
strict
distribution
of
justice
you
owe
the
safety
of
your
property
from
domestic
enemy
;
if
by
my
vigilance
and
valor
you
be
protect
from
foreign
foe
;
if
by
my
encouragement
of
genuine
industry
,
every
science
,
every
art
which
can
embellish
or
sweeten
life
,
be
produce
and
flourish
among
you
;
will
any
of
you
be
so
insensible
or
ungrateful
as
to
deny
praise
and
respect
to
him
by
whose
care
and
conduct
you
enjoy
these
blessing
?
<EOS>
I
wonder
not
at
the
censure
which
so
frequently
fall
on
those
in
my
station
;
but
I
wonder
that
those
in
my
station
so
frequently
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
what
strange
perverseness
of
nature
!
<EOS>
what
wanton
delight
in
mischief
must
taint
his
composition
,
who
prefer
danger
,
difficulty
,
and
disgrace
,
by
do
evil
,
to
safety
,
ease
,
and
honor
,
by
do
good
!
<EOS>
who
refuse
happiness
in
the
other
world
,
and
heaven
in
this
,
for
misery
there
and
hell
here
!
<EOS>
but
,
be
assure
,
my
intention
be
different
.
<EOS>
I
shall
always
endeavor
the
ease
,
the
happiness
,
and
the
glory
of
my
people
,
be
confident
that
,
by
so
do
,
I
take
the
most
certain
method
of
procure
them
all
to
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
strike
directly
into
the
road
of
goodness
,
and
receive
such
a
shout
of
applause
as
I
never
remember
to
have
hear
equal

<EOS>
He
be
go
a
little
way
when
a
spirit
limp
after
him
,
swear
he
would
fetch
him
back
.
  
<EOS>
this
spirit
,
I
be
presently
inform
,
be

who
have
draw
the
lot
of
his
prime

<EOS>
CHAPTER
VI
<EOS>
an
account
of
the
wheel
of
fortune
,
with
a
method
of
prepare
a
spirit
for
this
world
.
 
<EOS>
We
now
proceed
on
our
journey
,
without
stay
to
see
whether
he
fulfil
his
word
or
no
;
and
without
encounter
anything
worth
mention
,
come
to
the
place
where
the
spirit
on
their
passage
to
the
other
world
be
oblige
to
decide
by
lot
the
station
in
which
every
one
be
to
act
there
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
monstrous
wheel
,
infinitely
large
than
those
in
which
I
have
formerly
see
lottery
-
ticket
deposit
.
<EOS>
this
be
call
the
WHEEL
of
FORTUNE
.
  
<EOS>
the
goddess
herself
be
present
.
<EOS>
She
be
one
of
the
most
deform
female
I
ever
beheld
;
nor
could
I
help
observe
the
frown
she
express
when
any
beautiful
spirit
of
her
own
sex
pass
by
her
,
nor
the
affability
which
smile
in
her
countenance
on
the
approach
of
any
handsome
male
spirit
.
<EOS>
hence
I
account
for
the
truth
of
an
observation
I
have
often
make
on
earth
,
that
nothing
be
more
fortunate
than
handsome
man
,
nor
more
unfortunate
than
handsome
woman
.
<EOS>
the
reader
may
be
perhaps
pleased
with
an
account
of
the
whole
method
of
equip
a
spirit
for
his
entrance
into
the
flesh
.
  
<EOS>
first
,
then
,
he
receive
from
a
very
sage
person
,
whose
look
much
resemble
that
of
an
apothecary
(
his
warehouse
likewise
bear
an
affinity
to
an
apothecary
's
shop
)
,
a
small
phial
inscribe
,
the
PATHETIC
POTION
,
to
be
take
just
before
you
be
bear
.
<EOS>
this
potion
be
a
mixture
of
all
the
passion
,
but
in
no
exact
proportion
,
so
that
sometimes
one
predominate
,
and
sometimes
another
;
nay
,
often
in
the
hurry
of
make
up
,
one
particular
ingredient
be
,
as
we
be
inform
,
leave
out
.
<EOS>
the
spirit
receiveth
at
the
same
time
another
medicine
call
the
NOUSPHORIC
decoction
,
of
which
he
be
to
drink
ad
libitum
.
<EOS>
this
decoction
be
an
extract
from
the
faculty
of
the
mind
,
sometimes
extremely
strong
and
spirituous
,
and
sometimes
altogether
as
weak
;
for
very
little
care
be
take
in
the
preparation
.
<EOS>
this
decoction
be
so
extremely
bitter
and
unpleasant
,
that
,
notwithstanding
its
wholesomeness
,
several
spirit
will
not
be
persuade
to
swallow
a
drop
of
it
,
but
throw
it
away
,
or
give
it
to
any
other
who
will
receive
it
;
by
which
mean
some
who
be
not
disgust
by
the
nauseousness
drink
double
and
treble
portion
.
<EOS>
I
observe
a
beautiful
young
female
,
who
,
taste
it
immediately
from
curiosity
,
screw
up
her
face
and
cast
it
from
her
with
great
disdain
,
whence
advance
presently
to
the
wheel
,
she
draw
a
coronet
,
which
she
clap
up
so
eagerly
that
I
could
not
distinguish
the
degree
;
and
indeed
I
observe
several
of
the
same
sex
,
after
a
very
small
sip
,
throw
the
bottle
away
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
spirit
be
dismiss
by
the
operator
,
or
apothecary
,
he
be
at
liberty
to
approach
the
wheel
,
where
he
hath
a
right
to
extract
a
single
lot
:
but
those
whom
Fortune
favor
she
permit
sometimes
secretly
to
draw
three
or
four
.
<EOS>
I
observe
a
comical
kind
of
figure
who
draw
forth
a
handful
,
which
,
when
he
open
,
be
a
bishop
,
a
general
,
a
privy
-
counselor
,
a
player
,
and
a
poet
-
laureate
,
and
,
return
the
three
first
,
he
walk
off
,
smile
,
with
the
two
last
.
<EOS>
every
single
lot
contain
two
more
article
,
which
be
generally
dispose
so
as
to
render
the
lot
as
equal
as
possible
to
each
other
;
on
one
be
write
,
EARL
,
riches
,
health
,
DISQUIETUDE
;
on
another
,
COBLER
,
sickness
,
good
-
HUMOR
;
on
a
third
,
poet
,
CONTEMPT
,
self
-
SATISFACTION
;
on
a
fourth
,
general
,
honor
,
DISCONTENT
;
on
a
fifth
,
COTTAGE
,
happy
LOVE
;
on
a
sixth
,
COACH
and
SIX
,
IMPOTENT
JEALOUS
HUSBAND
;
on
a
seventh
,
PRIME

;
on
an
eighth

;
on
a
ninth
,
PHILOSOPHER
,
POVERTY
,
EASE
;
on
a
tenth
,
MERCHANT
,
riches
,
CARE
.
<EOS>
and
indeed
the
whole
seem
to
contain
such
a
mixture
of
good
and
evil
,
that
it
would
have
puzzle
me
which
to
choose
.
<EOS>
I
must
not
omit
here
that
in
every
lot
be
direct
whether
the
drawer
should
marry
or
remain
in
celibacy
,
the
married
lot
be
all
mark
with
a
large
pair
of
horn
.
<EOS>
We
be
oblige
,
before
we
quit
this
place
,
to
take
each
of
us
an
emetic
from
the
apothecary
,
which
immediately
purge
us
of
all
our
earthly
passion
,
and
presently
the
cloud
forsook
our
eye
,
as
it
doth
those
of
Aeneas
in
Virgil
,
when
remove
by
Venus
;
and
we
discern
thing
in
a
much
clear
light
than
before
.
<EOS>
We
begin
to
compassionate
those
spirit
who
be
make
their
entry
into
the
flesh
,
whom
we
have
till
then
secretly
envy
,
and
to
long
eagerly
for
those
delightful
plain
which
now
open
themselves
to
our
eye
,
and
to
which
we
now
hasten
with
the
utmost
eagerness
.
<EOS>
on
our
way
we
meet
with
several
spirit
with
very
dejected
countenance
;
but
our
expedition
would
not
suffer
us
to
ask
any
question
.
<EOS>
at
length
we
arrive
at
the
gate
of
Elysium
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
prodigious
crowd
of
spirit
wait
for
admittance
,
some
of
whom
be
admit
,
and
some
be
reject
;
for
all
be
strictly
examine
by
the
porter
,
whom
I
soon
discover
to
be
the
celebrated
judge
Minos
.
   
<EOS>
chapter
VII
<EOS>
the
proceeding
of
judge
Minos
at
the
gate
of
Elysium
.
 
<EOS>
I
now
get
near
enough
to
the
gate
to
hear
the
several
claim
of
those
who
endeavor
to
pass
.
<EOS>
the
first
among
other
pretension
,
set
forth
that
he
have
be
very
liberal
to
an
hospital
;
but
Minos
answer
,
"
ostentation
,
"
and
repulse
him
.
<EOS>
the
second
exhibit
that
he
have
constantly
frequent
his
church
,
be
a
rigid
observer
of
fast
-
day
:
he
likewise
represent
the
great
animosity
he
have
show
to
vice
in
other
,
which
never
escape
his
severest
censure
;
and
as
to
his
own
behavior
,
he
have
never
be
once
guilty
of
whore
,
drinking
,
gluttony
,
or
any
other
excess
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
have
disinherit
his
son
for
get
a
bastard
.
"
<EOS>
have
you
so
?
<EOS>
"
say
Minos
;
"
then
pray
return
into

shall
never

this
gate

a
dozen
other
,
who
have
advance
with
very
confident
countenance
,
see
him
reject
,
turn
about
of
their
own
accord
,
declare
,
if
he
could
not
pass
,
they
have
no
expectation
,
and
accordingly
they
follow
him
back
to
earth
;

the
fate
of
all
who
be
repulse

they
be
oblige

take

further
purification

crime

in

the
next
spirit
that
come
up
declare
he
have
do
neither
good

evil
in
the
world

for
that
since
his
arrival
at

he
have
spend
his
whole
time
in
search
of
curiosity
;

particularly
in
the
study
of
butterfly
,
of
which
he
have
collect
an
immense
number
.
<EOS>
Minos
make
him
no
answer
,
but
with
great
scorn
push
him
back
.
<EOS>
there
now
advance
a
very
beautiful
spirit
indeed
.
<EOS>
She
begin
to
ogle
Minos
the
moment
she
see
him
.
<EOS>
She
say
she
hope
there
be
some
merit
in
refuse
a
great
number
of
lover
,
and
die
a
maid
,
though
she
have
have
the
choice
of

Minos
tell
her
she
have
not
refuse
enow
yet
,

turn
her
back
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
succeed
by
a
spirit
who
tell
the
judge
he
believe
his
work
would
speak
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
work
?
"
answer
Minos
.
<EOS>
"
My
dramatic
work
,

reply
the
other
,
"
which
have
do
so
much
good
in
recommend
virtue
and
punishing
vice

"
very
well

the
judge
;

if

please
to
stand
by
,
the
first
person
who
pass
the
gate
by
your
mean
shall
carry
you
in
with
him
;
but
,
if
you
will
take
my
advice
,
I
think
,
for
expedition
sake
,
you
have
better
return
,
and
live
another
life
upon

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
bard
grumble
at
this
,
and
reply
that
,
besides
his
poetical
work
,
he
have
do
some
other
good
thing
:
for
that
he
have
once
lend
the
whole
profit
of
a
benefit
-
night
to
a
friend
,
and
by
that
mean
have
save
him
and
his
family
from
destruction
.
<EOS>
upon
this
the
gate
fly
open
,
and
Minos
desire
him
to
walk
in
,
tell
him
,
if
he
have
mention
this
at
first
,
he
may
have
spare
the
remembrance
of
his
play
.
<EOS>
the
poet
answer
,
he
believe
,
if
Minos
have
read
his
work
,
he
would
set
a
high
value
on
them
.
<EOS>
He
be
then
begin
to
repeat
,
but
Minos
push
him
forward
,
and
,
turn
his
back
to
him
,
apply
himself
to
the
next
passenger
,
a
very
genteel
spirit
,
who
make
a
very
low
bow
to
Minos
,
and
then
throw
himself
into
an
erect
attitude
,
and
imitate
the
motion
of
take
snuff
with
his
right
hand
.
<EOS>
Minos
ask
him
what
he
have
to
say
for
himself
.
<EOS>
He
answer
,
he
would
dance
a
minuet
with
any
spirit
in
Elysium
:
that
he
could
likewise
perform
all
his
other
exercise
very
well
,
and
hope
he
have
in
his
life
deserve
the
character
of
a
perfect
fine
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Minos
reply
it
would
be
great
pity
to
rob
the
world
of
so
fine
a
gentleman
,
and
therefore
desire
him
to
take
the
other
trip
.
<EOS>
the
beau
bow
,
thank
the
judge
,
and
say
he
desire
no
better
.
  
<EOS>
several
spirit
express
much
astonishment
at
this
his
satisfaction
;
but
we
be
afterwards
inform
he
have
not
take
the
emetic
above
mention
.
  
<EOS>
a
miserable
old
spirit
now
crawl
forwards
,
whose
face
I
think
I
have
formerly
see
near
Westminster
Abbey
.
<EOS>
He
entertain
Minos
with
a
long
harangue
of
what
he
have
do
when
in
the
HOUSE
;
and
then
proceed
to
inform
him
how
much
he
be
worth
,
without
attempt
to
produce
a
single
instance
of
any
one
good
action
.
<EOS>
Minos
stop
the
career
of
his
discourse
,
and
acquaint
him
he
must
take
a
trip
back
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
to
s
#
#

house
?
<EOS>
"
say
the
spirit
in
an
ecstasy
;

the
judge
,
without
make
him
any
answer
,
turn
to
another
,
who
with
a
very
solemn
air
and
great
dignity
,
acquaint
him
he
be
a
duke
.
<EOS>
"
to
the
right
-
about
,
Mr.
Duke
,
"
cry
Minos
,
"
you
be
infinitely
too
great
a
man
for
Elysium

and
then
,
give
him
a
kick
on
the
b
 
ch
,
he
address
himself
to
a
spirit
who
,
with
fear
and
tremble
,
beg
he
may
not
go
to
the
bottomless
pit
:
<EOS>
he
say
he
hope
Minos
would
consider
that
,
though
he
have
go
astray
,
he
have
suffer
for
it
 
that
it
be
necessity
which
drive
him
to
the
robbery
of
eighteenpence
,
which
he
have
commit
,
and
for
which
he
be
hang
 
that
he
have
do
some
good
action
in
his
life
 
that
he
have
support
an
aged
parent
with
his
labor
 
that
he
have
be
a
very
tender
husband
and
a
kind
father

that
he
have
ruin
himself
by

bail
for
his
friend

<EOS>
at
which
word
the
gate
open
,
and
Minos
bid
him
enter
,
give
him
a
slap
on
the
back
as
he
pass
by
him
.
<EOS>
a
great
number
of
spirit
now
come
forwards
,
who
all
declare
they
have
the
same
claim
,
and
that
the
captain
should
speak
for
them
.
<EOS>
He
acquaint
the
judge
that
they
have
be
all
slay
in
the
service
of
their
country

<EOS>
Minos
be
go
to
admit
them

have
the
curiosity
to
ask
who
have
be
the
invader
,
in
order
,
as
he
say
,
to
prepare
the
back
gate
for
him

<EOS>
the

answer
they
have
be
the
invader
themselves
 
that
they
have
enter
the
enemy

country
,
and
burn

several

"
by

that
be
the

<EOS>
We
be
to
execute
whatever
we

we
should
be
a
disgrace
to

very

<EOS>
"
You
be
brave

Minos

be
pleased
to
face
about
,
and
obey
my
command
for
once

in

you
do
where
there
be
no

let
me
advise
you
to
have
a
strict
regard
to
truth
for
the
future
,
and
not
call
the
depopulate

the

answer
,
in
a
rage
,
"
D####n

<EOS>
do
you
give
me
the
lie

and
be
go
to
take
Minos
by

<EOS>
have
not

you

more

"
<EOS>
a
very
stately
figure
now
present
himself
,
and
,
inform
Minos
he
be
a
patriot
,
begin
a
very
florid
harangue
on
public
virtue
and
the
liberty
of
his
country
.
<EOS>
upon
which
Minos
show
him
the
utmost
respect
,
and
order
the
gate
to

<EOS>
the
patriot
be
not
content
with
this
applause
;
he
say
he
have
behave
as
well
in
place
as
he
have
do
in
the
opposition
;

that
,
though
he
be
now
oblige
to
embrace
the
court
measure

behave
very
honestly
to
his

bring
as
many
in
as
be

<EOS>
"
hold
a
moment
,

say
Minos
:
"
on
second
consideration
,
Mr.

I
think
a

of
your
great
virtue

ability
will
be
so
much
miss
by
your

that
,
if
I
may
advise
you
,
you
should
take
a
journey
back
again

I
be
sure
you
will
not
decline
it
;
for
I
be
certain
you
will
,
with
great
readiness
,
sacrifice
your
own
happiness
to
the
public
good

"
<EOS>
the
patriot
smile
,
and
tell
Minos
he
believe
he
be
in
jest
;
and
be
offer
to
enter
the
gate
,
but
the
judge
lay
fast
hold
of
him
and
insist
on
his
return
,
which
the
patriot
still
decline

he
at
last
order
his

to
seize
him

him
back

a
spirit
now
advanced
,
and
the
gate
be
immediately
throw
open
to
him
before
he
have
speak
a
word

I
hear
some
whisper
,
"
that
be
our
last
lord
mayor

<EOS>
It
now
come
to
our
company

turn

<EOS>
the
fair
spirit
which
I
mention
with
so
much
applause
in
the
beginning
of
my
journey
pass
through
very
easily
;
but
the
grave
lady
be
reject
on
her
first
appearance
,
Minos
declare
there
be
not
a
single
prude
in
Elysium
.
  
<EOS>
the
judge
then
address
himself
to
me
,
who
little
expect
to
pass
this
fiery
trial
.
<EOS>
I
confess
I
have
indulge
myself
very
freely
with
wine
and
woman
in
my
youth
,
but
have
never
do
an
injury
to
any
man
live
,
nor
avoid
an
opportunity
of
do
good
;
that
I
pretend
to
very
little
virtue
more
than
general
philanthrophy
and
private
friendship
.
<EOS>
I
be
proceed
,
when
Minos
bid
me
enter
the
gate
,
and
not
indulge
myself
with
trumpet
forth
my
virtue
.
<EOS>
I
accordingly
pass
forward
with
my
lovely
companion
,
and
,
embrace
her
with
vast
eagerness
,
but
spiritual
innocence
,
she
return
my
embrace
in
the
same
manner
,
and
we
both
congratulate
ourselves
on
our
arrival
in
this
happy
region
,
whose
beauty
no
painting
of
the
imagination
can
describe

<EOS>
chapter
viii
<EOS>
the
adventure
which
the
author
meet
on
his
first
entrance
into
Elysium
.
 
<EOS>
We
pursue
our
way
through
a
delicious
grove
of
orange
-
tree
,
where
I
see
infinite
number
of
spirit
,
every
one
of
whom
I
know
,
and
be
know
by
them
(
for
spirit
here
know
one
another
by
intuition
)
.
<EOS>
I
presently
meet
a
little
daughter
whom
I
have
lose
several
year
before
.
<EOS>
good
god
!
<EOS>
what
word
can
describe
the
rapture
,
the
melt
passionate
tenderness
,
with
which
we
kiss
each
other
,
continue
in
our
embrace
,
with
the
most
ecstatic
joy
,
a
space
which
,
if
time
have
be
measure
here
as
on
earth
,
could
not
be
less
than
half
a
year
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
spirit
with
whom
I
enter
into
discourse
be
the
famous
Leonidas
of
Sparta
.
<EOS>
I
acquaint
him
with
the
honor
which
have
be
do
him
by
a
celebrated
poet
of
our
nation
;
to
which
he
answer
he
be
very
much
oblige
to
him
.
<EOS>
We
be
presently
afterwards
entertain
with
the
most
delicious
voice
I
have
ever
hear
,
accompany
by
a
violin
,
equal
to
Signior
Piantinida
.
<EOS>
I
presently
discover
the
musician
and
songster
to
be
Orpheus
and
Sappho
.
  
<EOS>
Old
Homer
be
present
at
this
concert
(
if
I
may
so
call
it
)
,
and
Madam
Dacier
sit
in
his
lap
.
<EOS>
He
ask
much
after
Mr.
Pope
,
and
say
he
be
very
desirous
of
see
him
;
for
that
he
have
read
his
Iliad
in
his
translation
with
almost
as
much
delight
as
he
believe
he
have
give
other
in
the
original
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
curiosity
to
inquire
<EOS>
whether
he
have
really
writ
that
poem
in
detached
piece
,
and
sing
it
about
as
ballad
all
over
Greece
,
accord
to
the
report
which
go
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
smile
at
my
question
,
and
ask
me
whether
there
appear
any
connection
in
the
poem
;
for
if
there
do
he
think
I
may
answer
myself
.
<EOS>
I
then
importune
him
to
acquaint
me
in
which
of
the
city
which
contend
for
the
honor
of
his
birth
he
be
really
bear
?
<EOS>
to
which
he
answer
,
"
upon
my
soul
I
can
not
tell
.
"
  
<EOS>
Virgil
then
come
up
to
me
,
with
Mr.
Addison
under
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
how
many
translation
have
these
few
last
year
produce
of
my
Aeneid
?
<EOS>
"
I
tell
him
I
believe
several
,
but
I
could
not
possibly
remember
;
for
that
I
have
never
read
any
but
Dr.
Trapp
's
.
"
<EOS>
ay
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
be
a
curious
piece
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
I
then
acquaint
him
with
the
discovery
make
by
Mr.
Warburton
of
the
elusinian
mystery
couch
in
his
sixth
book
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
mystery
?
<EOS>
"
say
Mr.
Addison
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Elusinian
,
"
answer
Virgil
,
"
which
I
have
disclose
in
my
sixth
book
.
"
<EOS>
"
how
!
"
reply
Addison
.
<EOS>
"
You
never
mention
a
word
of
any
such
mystery
to
me
in
all
our
acquaintance
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
be
unnecessary
,
"
cry
the
other
,
"
to
a
man
of
your
infinite
learning
:
<EOS>
besides
,
you
always
tell
me

my

.
"
<EOS>
upon
this
I
think
the
critic
look
a
little
out
of
countenance
,
and
turn
aside
to
a
very
merry
spirit
,
one
Dick
Steele
,
who
embrace
him
,
and
tell
him
he
have
be
the
great
man
upon
earth
;
that
he
readily
resign
up
all
the
merit
of
his
own
work
to
him
.
<EOS>
upon
which
Addison
give
him
a
gracious
smile
,
and
,
clap
him
on
the
back
with
much
solemnity
,
cry
out
,
"
well
say
,
Dick
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
then
observe
Shakespeare
stand
between
Betterton
and
Booth
,
and
decide
a
difference
between
those
two
great
actor
concern
the
place
an
accent
in
one
of
his
line
:
this
be
dispute
on
both
side
with
a
warmth
which
surprise
me
in
Elysium
,
till
I
discover
by
intuition
that
every
soul
retain
its
principal
characteristic
,
be
,
indeed
,
its
very
essence
.
<EOS>
the
line
be
that
celebrate
one
in
Othello
 
<EOS>
put
out
the
light
,
and
then
put
out
the
light
.
<EOS>
accord
to
Betterton
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Booth
contend
to
have
it
thus
:
 
put
out
the
light
,
and
then
put
out
the
light
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
offer
my
conjecture
on
this
occasion
,
and
suggest
it
may
perhaps
be
 
<EOS>
put
out
the
light
,
and
then
put
out
THY
light
.
<EOS>
another
hint
a
reading
very
sophisticated
in
my
opinion
  
Put
out
the
light
,
and
then
put
out
thee
,
light
,
make
light
to
be
the
vocative
case
.
<EOS>
another
would
have
alter
the
last
word
,
and
read
  
put
out
THY
light
,
and
then
put
out
THY
sight
.
<EOS>
but
Betterton
say
,
if
the
text
be
to
be
disturb
,
he
see
no
reason
why
a
word
may
not
be
change
as
well
as
a
letter
,
and
,
instead
of
"
put
out
thy
light
,
"
you
may
read
"
put
out
thy
eye
.
<EOS>
"
at
last
it
be
agree
on
all
side
to
refer
the
matter
to
the
decision
of
Shakespeare
himself
,
who
deliver
his
sentiment
as
follow
:
"
faith
,
gentleman
,
it
be
so
long
since
I
write
the
line
,
I
have
forget
my
meaning
.
<EOS>
this
I
know
,
could
I
have
dream
so
much
nonsense
would
have
be
talk
and
writ
about
it
,
I
would
have
blot
it
out
of
my
work
;
for
I
be
sure
,
if
any
of
these
be
my
meaning
,
it
doth
me
very
little
honor
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
then
interrogate
concern
some
other
ambiguous
passage
in
his
work
;
but
he
decline
any
satisfactory
answer
;
say
,
if
Mr.
Theobald
have
not
writ
about
it
sufficiently
,
there
be
three
or
four
more
new
edition
of
his
play
come
out
,
which
he
hope
would
satisfy
every
one
:
conclude
,
"
I
marvel
nothing
so
much
as
that
man
will
gird
themselves
at
discover
obscure
beauty
in
an
author
.
<EOS>
certe
the
great
and
most
pregnant
beauty
be
ever
the
plain
and
most
evidently
strike
;
and
when
two
meaning
of
a
passage
can
in
the
least
balance
our
judgment
which
to
prefer
,
I
hold
it
matter
of
unquestionable
certainty
that
neither
of
them
be
worth
a
farthing
.
<EOS>
"
from
his
work
our
conversation
turn
on
his
monument
;
upon
which
,
Shakespeare
,
shake
his
side
,
and
address
himself
to
Milton
,
cry
out
,
"
on
my
word
,
brother
Milton
,
they
have
bring
a
noble
set
of
poet
together
;
they
would
have
be
hang
erst
<EOS>
have
[
ere
they
have
]
convene
such
a
company
at
their
table
when
alive
.
"
<EOS>
"
true
,
brother
,
"
answer
Milton
,
"
unless
we
have
be
as
incapable
of

then
as
we

<EOS>
chapter
IX
<EOS>
More
adventure
in
Elysium
.
 
<EOS>
a
crowd
of
spirit
now
join
us
,
whom
I
soon
perceive
to
be
the
hero
,
who
here
frequently
pay
their
respect
to
the
several
bard
the
recorder
of
their
action
.
<EOS>
I
now
see
Achilles
and
ulysse
address
themselves
to
Homer
,
and
Aeneas
and
Julius
Caesar
to
Virgil
:
<EOS>
Adam
go
up
to
Milton
,
upon
which
I
whisper
Mr.
Dryden
that
I
think
the
devil
should
have
pay
his
compliment
there
,
accord
to
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
Dryden
only
answer
,
"
I
believe
the
devil
be
in
me
when
I
say
so
.
"
<EOS>
several
apply
themselves
to
Shakespeare
,
amongst
whom
Henry
V
make
a
very
distinguishing
appearance
.
<EOS>
while
my
eye
be
fix
on
that
monarch
a
very
small
spirit
come
up
to
me
,
shake
me
heartily
by
the
hand
,
and
tell
me
his
name
be
THOMAS
thumb
.
<EOS>
I
express
great
satisfaction
in
see
him
,
nor
could
I
help
speak
my
resentment
against
the
historian
,
who
have
do
such
injustice
to
the
stature
of
this
great
little
man
,
which
he
represent
to
be
no
big
than
a
span
,
whereas
I
plainly
perceive
at
first
sight
he
be
full
a
foot
and
a
half
(
and
the
37th
part
of
an
inch
more
,
as
he
himself
inform
me
)
,
be
indeed
little
short
than
some
considerable
beaux
of
the
present
age
.
<EOS>
I
ask
this
little
hero
concern
the
truth
of
those
story
relate
of
him
,
viz
.
,
of
the
pudding
,
and
the
cow
's
belly
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
former
,
he
say
it
be
a
ridiculous
legend
,
worthy
to
be
laugh
at
;
but
as
to
the
latter
,
he
could
not
help
own
there
be
some
truth
in
it
:
nor
have
he
any
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
it
,
as
he
be
swallow
by
surprise
;
add
,
with
great
fierceness
,
that
if
he
have
have
any
weapon
in
his
hand
the
cow
should
have
as
soon
swallow
the
devil
.
  
<EOS>
He
speak
the
last
word
with
so
much
fury
,
and
seem
so
confounded
,
that
,
perceive
the
effect
it
have
on
him
,
I
immediately
waive
the
story
,
and
,
pass
to
other
matter
,
we
have
much
conversation
touch
giant
.
<EOS>
He
say
,
so
far
from
kill
any
,
he
have
never
see
one
alive
;
that
he
believe
those
action
be
by
mistake
record
of
him
,
instead
of
Jack
the
giant
-
killer
,
whom
he
know
very
well
,
and
who
have
,
he
fancy
,
extirpate
the
race
.
<EOS>
I
assure
him
to
the
contrary
,
and
tell
him
I
have
myself
see
a
huge
tame
giant
,
who
very
complacently
stay
in
London
a
whole
winter
,
at
the
special
request
of
several
gentleman
and
lady
;
though
the
affair
of
his
family
call
him
home
to
Sweden
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
beheld
a
stern
-
look
spirit
lean
on
the
shoulder
of
another
spirit
,
and
presently
discern
the
former
to
be
Oliver
Cromwell
,
and
the
latter
Charles
Martel
.
<EOS>
I
own
<EOS>
I
be
a
little
surprised
at
see
Cromwell
here
,
for
I
have
be
teach
by
my
grandmother
that
he
be
carry
away
by
the
devil
himself
in
a
temp
;
but
he
assure
me
,
on
his
honor
,
there
be
not
the
least
truth
in
that
story
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
confess
he
have
narrowly
escape
the
bottomless
pit
;
and
,
if
the
former
part
of
his
conduct
have
not
be
more
to
his
honor
than
the
latter
,
he
have
be
certainly
souse
into
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
nevertheless
,
send
back
to
the
upper
world
with
this
lot
:
 
ARMY
,
CAVALIER
,
DISTRESS
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
bear
,
for
the
second
time
,
the
day
of
Charles
II
's
restoration
,
into
a
family
which
have
lose
a
very
considerable
fortune
in
the
service
of
that
prince
and
his
father
,
for
which
they
receive
the
reward
very
often
confer
by
prince
on
real
merit
,
viz
.
 
<EOS>
000
.
<EOS>
at
16
his
father
buy
a
small
commission
for
him
in
the
army
,
in
which
he
serve
without
any
promotion
all
the
reign
of
Charles
II
and
of
his
brother
.
<EOS>
at
the
Revolution
he
quit
his
regiment
,
and
follow
the
fortune
of
his
former
master
,
and
be
in
his
service
dangerously
wound
at
the
famous
battle
of
the
Boyne
,
where
he
fight
in
the
capacity
of
a
private
soldier
.
<EOS>
He
recover
of
this
wound
,
and
retire
after
the
unfortunate
king
to
Paris
,
where
he
be
reduce
to
support
a
wife
and
seven
child
(
for
his
lot
have
horn
in
it
)
by
clean
shoe
and
snuff
candle
at
the
opera
.
<EOS>
in
which
situation
,
after
he
have
spend
a
few
miserable
year
,
he
die
half
-
starve
and
break
-
hearted
.
<EOS>
He
then
revisit
Minos
,
who
,
compassionate
his
suffering
by
mean
of
that
family
,
to
whom
he
have
be
in
his
former
capacity
so
bitter
an
enemy
,
suffer
him
to
enter
here
.
  
<EOS>
My
curiosity
would
not
refrain
ask
him
one
question
,
i.
e.
,
whether
in
reality
he
have
any
desire
to
obtain
the
crown
?
<EOS>
He
smile
,
and
say
,
"
no
more
than
an
ecclesiastic
hath
to
the
miter
,
when
he
cry
Nolo
episcopari
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
seem
to
express
some
contempt
at
the
question
,
and
presently
turn
away
.
  
<EOS>
a
venerable
spirit
appear
next
,
whom
I
find
to
be
the
great
historian
Livy
.
<EOS>
Alexander
the
Great
,
who
be
just
arrive
from
the
palace
of
death
,
pass
by
him
with
a
frown
.
<EOS>
the
historian
,
observe
it
,
say
,
"
ay
,
you
may
frown
;
but
those
troop
which
conquer
the
base
asiatic
slave
would
have
make
no
figure
against
the
Romans
.
<EOS>
"
We
then
privately
lament
the
loss
of
the
most
valuable
part
of
his
history
;
after
which
he
take
occasion
to
commend
the
judicious
collection
make
by
Mr.
Hook
,
which
,
he
say
,
be
infinitely
preferable
to
all
other
;
and
at
my
mention
Echard
's
he
give
a
bounce
,
not
unlike
the
go
off
of
a
squib
,
and
be
depart
from
me
,
when
I
beg
him
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
in
one
point
 
whether
he
be
really
superstitious
or
no
?
<EOS>
for
I
have
always
believe
he
be
till
Mr.
Leibnitz
have
assure
me
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
He
answer
sullenly
,
"
Doth
Mr.
Leibnitz
know
my
mind
better
than
myself
?
"
and
then
walk
away
.

X
<EOS>
the
author
be
surprised
at
meet
Julian
the
apostate
in
Elysium
;
but
be
satisfied
by
him
by
what
mean
he
procure
his
entrance
there
.
<EOS>
Julian
relate
his
adventure
in
the
character
of
a
slave
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
be
depart
I
hear
him
salute
a
spirit
by
the
name
of
Mr.
Julian
the
apostate
.
<EOS>
this
exceedingly
amaze
me
;
for
I
have
conclude
that
no
man
ever
have
a
well
title
to
the
bottomless
pit
than
he
.
<EOS>
but
I
soon
find
that
this
same
Julian
the
apostate
be
also
the
very
individual
archbishop
Latimer
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
that
several
lie
have
be
raise
on
him
in
his
former
capacity
,
nor
be
he
so
bad
a
man
as
he
have
be
represent
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
have
be
deny
admittance
,
and
force
to
undergo
several
subsequent
pilgrimage
on
earth
,
and
to
act
in
the
different
character
of
a
slave
,
a
Jew
,
a
general
,
an
heir
,
a
carpenter
,
a
beau
,
a
monk
,
a
fiddler
,
a
wise
man
,
a
king
,
a
fool
,
a
beggar
,
a
prince
,
a
statesman
,
a
soldier
,
a
tailor
,
an
alderman
,
a
poet
,
a
knight
,
a
dancing
-
master
,
and
three
time
a
bishop
,
before
his
martyrdom
,
which
,
together
with
his
other
behavior
in
this
last
character
,
satisfy
the
judge
,
and
procure
him
a
passage
to
the
bless
region
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
him
such
various
character
must
have
produce
incident
extremely
entertaining
;
and
if
he
remember
all
,
as
I
suppose
he
do
,
and
have
leisure
,
I
should
be
oblige
to
him
for
the
recital
.
<EOS>
He
answer
he
perfectly
recollect
every
circumstance
;
and
as
to
leisure
,
the
only
business
of
that
happy
place
be
to
contribute
to
the
happiness
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
thank
me
for
add
to
his
,
in
propose
to
him
a
method
of
increase
mine
.
<EOS>
I
then
take
my
little
darling
in
one
hand
,
and
my
favorite
fellow
-
traveler
in
the
other
,
and
,
go
with
him
to
a
sunny
bank
of
flower
,
we
all
sit
down
,
and
he
begin
as
follow
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
be
sufficiently
acquaint
with
my
story
during
the
time
I
act
the
part
of
the
emperor
Julian
,
though
I
assure
you
all
which
hath
be
relate
of
me
be
not
true
,
particularly
with
regard
to
the
many
prodigy
forerun
my
death
.
<EOS>
however
,
they
be
now
very
little
worth
dispute
;
and
if
they
can
serve
any
purpose
of
the
historian
they
be
extremely
at
his
service
.
<EOS>
"
My
next
entrance
into
the
world
be
at
Laodicea
,
in
Syria
,
in
a
roman
family
of
no
great
note
;
and
,
be
of
a
rove
disposition
,
I
come
at
the
age
of
seventeen
to
Constantinople
,
where
,
after
about
a
year
's
stay
,
I
set
out
for
Thrace
,
at
the
time
when
the
emperor
Valens
admit
the
Goths
into
that
country
.
<EOS>
I
be
there
so
captivate
with
the
beauty
of
a
gothic
lady
,
the
wife
of
one
Rodoric
,
a
captain
,
whose
name
,
out
of
the
most
delicate
tenderness
for
her
lovely
sex
,
I
shall
even
at
this
distance
conceal
;
since
her
behavior
to
me
be
more
consistent
with
good
-
nature
than
with
that
virtue
which
woman
be
oblige
to
preserve
against
every
assailant
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
procure
an
intimacy
with
this
woman
I
sell
myself
a
slave
to
her
husband
,
who
,
be
of
a
nation
not
over
-
incline
to
jealousy
,
present
me
to
his
wife
,
for
those
very
reason
which
would
have
induce
one
of
a
jealous
complexion
to
have
withhold
me
from
her
,
namely
,
for
that
I
be
young
and
handsome
.
  
<EOS>
"
matter
succeed
so
far
accord
to
my
wish
,
and
the
sequel
answer
those
hope
which
this
beginning
have
raise
.
<EOS>
I
soon
perceive
my
service
be
very
acceptable
to
her
;
I
often
meet
her
eye
,
nor
do
she
withdraw
them
without
a
confusion
which
be
scarce
consistent
with
entire
purity
of
heart
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
give
me
every
day
fresh
encouragement
;
but
the
unhappy
distance
which
circumstance
have
place
between
us
deter
me
long
from
make
any
direct
attack
;
and
she
be
too
strict
an
observer
of
decorum
to
violate
the
severe
rule
of
modesty
by
advance
first
;
but
passion
at
last
get
the
well
of
my
respect
,
and
I
resolve
to
make
one
bold
attempt
<EOS>
,
whatever
be
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
lay
hold
of
the
first
kind
opportunity
,
when
she
be
alone
and
my
master
abroad
,
I
stoutly
assail
the
citadel
and
carry
it
by
storm
.
<EOS>
well
may
I
say
by
storm
;
for
the
resistance
I
meet
be
extremely
resolute
,
and
indeed
as
much
as
the
most
perfect
decency
would
require
.
<EOS>
She
swear
often
she
would
cry
out
for
help
;
but
I
answer
it
be
in
vain
,
see
there
be
no
person
near
to
assist
her
;
and
probably
she
believe
me
,
for
she
do
not
once
actually
cry
out
,
which
if
she
have
,
I
may
very
likely
have
be
prevent
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
she
find
her
virtue
thus
subdue
against
her
will
she
patiently
submit
to
her
fate
,
and
quietly
suffer
me
a
long
time
to
enjoy
the
most
delicious
fruit
of
my
victory
;
but
envious
fortune
resolve
to
make
me
pay
a
dear
price
for
my
pleasure
.
<EOS>
one
day
in
the
midst
of
our
happiness
we
be
suddenly
surprise
by
the
unexpected
return
of
her
husband
,
who
,
come
directly
into
his
wife
's
apartment
,
just
allow
me
time
to
creep
under
the
bed
.
<EOS>
the
disorder
in
which
he
find
his
wife
may
have
surprise
a
jealous
temper
;
but
his
be
so
far
otherwise
,
that
possibly
no
mischief
may
have
happen
have
he
not
by
a
cross
accident
discover
my
leg
,
which
be
not
well
hide
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
draw
me
out
by
them
,
and
then
,
turn
to
his
wife
with
a
stern
countenance
,
begin
to
handle
a
weapon
he
wear
by
his
side
,
with
which
I
be
persuade
he
would
have
instantly
dispatch
her
,
have
I
not
very
gallantly
,
and
with
many
imprecation
,
assert
her
innocence
and
my
own
guilt
;
which
,
however
,
I
protest
have
hitherto
go
no
farther
than
design
.
<EOS>
She
so
well
second
my
plea
(
for
she
be
a
woman
of
wonderful
art
)
,
that
he
be
at
length
impose
upon
;
and
now
all
his
rage
be
direct
against
me
,
threaten
all
manner
of
torture
,
which
the
poor
lady
be
in
too
great
<EOS>
a
fright
and
confusion
to
dissuade
him
from
execute
;
and
perhaps
,
if
her
concern
for
me
have
make
her
attempt
it
<EOS>
,
it
would
have
raise
a
jealousy
in
him
not
afterwards
to
be
remove
.
  
<EOS>
"
after
some
hesitation
Roderic
cry
out
he
have
luckily
hit
on
the
most
proper
punishment
for
me
in
the
world
,
by
a
method
which
would
at
once
do
severe
justice
on
me
for
my
criminal
intention
,
and
at
the
same
time
prevent
me
from
any
danger
of
execute
my
wicked
purpose
hereafter
.
<EOS>
this
cruel
resolution
be
immediately
execute
,
and
I
be
no
longer
worthy
the
name
of
a
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
thus
disqualify
me
from
do
him
any
future
injury
,
he
still
retain
me
in
his
family
;
but
the
lady
,
very
probably
repent
of
what
she
have
do
,
and
look
on
me
as
the
author
of
her
guilt
,
would
never
for
the
future
give
me
either
a
kind
word
or
look
:
and
shortly
after
,
a
great
exchange
be
make
between
the
Romans
and
the
Goths
of
dog
for
man
,
my
lady
exchange
me
with
a
roman
widow
for
a
small
lap
-
dog
,
give
a
considerable
sum
of
money
to
boot
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
this
widow
's
service
I
remain
seven
year
,
during
all
which
time
I
be
very
barbarously
treat
.
<EOS>
I
be
work
without
the
least
mercy
,
and
often
severely
beat
by
a
swinging
maid
-
servant
,
who
never
call
me
by
any
other
name
than
those
of
the
Thing
and
the
Animal
.
<EOS>
though
I
use
my
utmost
industry
to
please
,
it
never
be
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
neither
the
lady
nor
her
woman
would
eat
anything
I
touch
,
say
they
do
not
believe
me
wholesome
.
<EOS>
It
be
unnecessary
to
repeat
particular
;
in
a
word
,
you
can
imagine
no
kind
of
ill
usage
which
I
do
not
suffer
in
this
family
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
last
an
heathen
priest
,
an
acquaintance
of
my
lady
's
,
obtain
me
of
her
for
a
present
.
<EOS>
the
scene
be
now
totally
change
,
and
I
have
as
much
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
my
present
situation
as
I
have
to
lament
my
former
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
absolutely
my
master
's
favorite
,
that
the
rest
of
the
slave
pay
me
almost
as
much
regard
as
they
show
to
him
,
<EOS>
well
know
that
it
be
entirely
in
my
power
to
command
and
treat
them
as
I
please
.
<EOS>
I
be
intrust
with
all
my
master
's
secret
,
and
use
to
assist
him
in
privately
convey
away
by
night
the
sacrifice
from
the
altar
,
which
the
people
believe
the
deity
themselves
devour
.
<EOS>
upon
these
we
feast
very
elegantly
,
nor
could
invention
suggest
a
rarity
which
we
do
not
pamper
ourselves
with
.
<EOS>
perhaps
you
may
admire
at
the
close
union
between
this
priest
and
his
slave
,
but
we
live
in
an
intimacy
which
the
Christians
think
criminal
;
but
my
master
,
who
know
the
will
of
the
god
,
with
whom
he
tell
me
he
often
converse
,
assure
me
it
be
perfectly
innocent
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
happy
life
continue
about
four
year
,
when
my
master
's
death
,
occasion
by
a
surfeit
get
by
overfeed
on
several
exquisite
dainty
,
put
an
end
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
now
fall
into
the
hand
of
one
of
a
very
different
disposition
,
and
this
be
no
other
than
the
celebrated
St.
Chrysostom
,
who
diet
me
with
sermon
instead
of
sacrifice
,
and
fill
my
ear
with
good
thing
,
but
not
my
belly
.
<EOS>
instead
of
high
food
to
fatten
and
pamper
my
flesh
,
I
have
receipt
to
mortify
and
reduce
it
.
<EOS>
with
these
I
edify
so
well
,
that
within
a
few
month
I
become
a
skeleton
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
he
have
convert
me
to
his
faith
,
I
be
well
enough
satisfied
with
this
new
manner
of
living
,
by
which
he
teach
me
I
may
insure
myself
an
eternal
reward
in
a
future
state
.
<EOS>
the
saint
be
a
good
-
natured
man
,
and
never
give
me
an
ill
word
but
once
,
which
be
occasion
by
my
neglect
to
place
aristophane
,
which
be
his
constant
bedfellow
,
on
his
pillow
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
indeed
,
extremely
fond
of
that
greek
poet
,
and
frequently
make
me
read
his
comedy
to
him
.
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
any
of
the
loose
passage
he
would
smile
,
and
say
,
"
It
be
pity
his
matter
be
not
as
pure
as
his
style
;
"
of
which
latter
he
be
so
immoderately
fond
that
,
notwithstanding
the
detestation
he
express
for
obscenity
,
he
hath
make
me
repeat
those
passage
ten
time
over
.
<EOS>
the
character
of
this
good
man
hath
be
very
unjustly
attack
by
his
heathen
contemporary
,
particularly
with
regard
to
woman
;
but
his
severe
invective
against
that
sex
be
his
sufficient
justification
.
  
<EOS>
"
from
the
service
of
this
saint
,
from
whom
I
receive
manumission
,
I
enter
into
the
family
of
Timasius
,
a
leader
of
great
eminence
in
the
imperial
army
,
into
whose
favor
I
so
far
insinuate
myself
that
he
prefer
me
to
a
good
command
,
and
soon
make
me
partak
of
both
his
company
and
his
secret
.
<EOS>
I
soon
grow
intoxicate
with
this
preferment
,
and
the
more
he
load
me
with
benefit
<EOS>
the
more
he
raise
my
opinion
of
my
own
merit
,
which
,
still
outstrip
the
reward
he
confer
on
me
,
inspire
me
rather
with
dissatisfaction
than
gratitude
.
<EOS>
and
thus
,
by
prefer
me
beyond
my
merit
or
first
expectation
,
he
make
me
an
envious
aspiring
enemy
,
whom
perhaps
a
more
moderate
bounty
would
have
preserve
a
dutiful
servant
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fall
now
acquaint
with
one
Lucilius
,
a
creature
of
the
prime
minister
Eutropius
,
who
have
by
his
favor
be
raise
to
the
post
of
a
tribune
;
a
man
of
low
moral
,
and
eminent
only
in
that
mean
of
quality
,
cunne
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
,
imagine
me
a
fit
tool
for
the
minister
's
purpose
,
have
often
sound
my
principle
of
honor
and
honesty
,
both
which
he
declare
to
me
be
word
without
mean
,
and
find
my
ready
concurrence
in
his
sentiment
,
recommend
me
to
Eutropius
as
very
proper
to
execute
some
wicked
purpose
he
have
contrive
against
my
frend
Timasius
.
<EOS>
the
minister
embrace
this
recommendation
,
and
I
be
accordingly
acquaint
by
Lucilius
(
after
some
previous
account
of
the
great
esteem
Eutropius
entertain
of
me
,
from
the
testimony
he
have
bear
of
my
part
)
that
he
would
introduce
me
to
him
;
add
that
he
be
a
great
encourager
of
merit
,
and
that
I
may
depend
upon
his
favor
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
with
little
difficulty
prevail
on
to
accept
of
this
invitation
.
<EOS>
a
late
hour
therefore
the
next
evening
be
appoint
,
I
attend
my
friend
Lucilius
to
the
minister
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
He
receive
me
with
the
utmost
civility
and
cheerfulness
,
and
affect
so
much
regard
to
me
,
that
I
,
who
know
nothing
of
these
high
scene
of
life
,
conclude
I
have
in
him
a
most
disintereste
friend
,
owe
to
the
favorable
report
which
Lucilius
have
make
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
however
soon
cure
of
this
opinion
;
for
immediately
after
supper
our
discourse
turn
on
the
injustice
which
the
generality
of
the
world
be
guilty
of
in
their
conduct
to
great
man
,
expect
that
they
should
reward
their
private
merit
,
without
ever
endeavor
to
apply
it
to
their
use
.
<EOS>
"
what
avail
,
"
say
Eutropius
,
"
the
learning
,
wit
,
courage
,
or
any
virtue
which
a
man
may
be
possess
of
,
to
me
,
unless
I
receive
some
benefit
from
them
?
<EOS>
Hath
<EOS>
he
not
more
merit
to
me
who
doth
my
business
and
obey
my
command
,
without
any
of
these
quality
?
<EOS>
"
I
give
such
entire
satisfaction
in
my
answer
on
this
head
,
that
both
the
minister
and
his
creature
grow
bold
,
and
after
some
preface
begin
to
accuse
Timasius
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
find
I
do
not
attempt
to
defend
him
,
Lucilius
swear
a
great
oath
that
he
be
not
fit
to
live
,
and
that
he
would
destroy
him
.
<EOS>
eutropius
answer
that
it
would
be
too
dangerous
a
task
:
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
"
say
he
,
"
his
crime
be
of
so
black
a
dye
,
and
so
well
known
to
the
emperor
,
that
his
death
must
be
a
very
acceptable
service
,
and
could
not
fail
meet
a
proper
reward
:
<EOS>
but
I
question
whether
you
be
capable
of
execute
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
if
he
be
not
,
"
cry
I
,
"
I
be
;
and
surely
no
man
can
have
great
motive
to
destroy
him
than
myself
:
for
,
besides
his
disloyalty
to
my
prince
,
for
whom
I
have
so
perfect
a
duty
,
I
have
private
disobligation
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
fellow
put
over
my
head
,
to
the
great
scandal
of
the
service
in
general
,
and
to
my
own
prejudice
and
disappointment
in
particular

<EOS>
"
I
will
not
repeat
you
my
whole
speech
;
but
,
to
be
as
concise
as
possible
,
when
we
part
that
evening
the
minister
squeeze
me
heartily
by
the
hand
,
and
with
great
commendation
of
my
honesty
and
assurance
of
his
favor

he
appoint
me
the
next
evening
to
come
to
him
alone

find
me
,
after
a
little
more
scrutiny

ready
for
his
purpose

he
propose
to
me
to
accuse
Timasius

high
treason

me
the
high
reward

I
would
undertake
it

consequence

him

ruin

truly

when
I
wait
on
Eutropius
for
the
fulfil
his
promise

receive
me
with
great
distance
and
coldness

,
on
my
drop
some
hint
of
my
expectation
from
him

he
affect
not
to
understand
me

he

impunity
be
the
utmost
I
could
hope
for
on
discover
my
accomplice

whose
offense
be
only
great

me
he

great
difficulty

obtain
a
pardon
for
me
from
the
emperor

he
say
,
he

very
hardly

away

himself

I
be
so
incensed

this
treatment

revenge

two
obstruction

my

both
which

over

the

murder
her

what

bad

burn
her

bad

myself
as

thus
carry
my

secondly
,
to
lessen
my

coldly

openly

justice

My

survive
the

short

I
be
now
reduce
to
great
distress

a
young
Roman
of
considerable
rank
take
a
fancy
to
me

receive
me
into
his

converse
with
me
in

familiarity

He
have
a
violent
attachment

music

would
learn
to
play
on

through
want
of
genius

never

his

I
continue
this
behavior
I
may
possibly
have
reap
the
great
advantage
from
his
kindness

I
have
raise
his
own
opinion
of
his
musical
ability
so
high
,
that
he
now
begin
to
prefer
his
skill
to
mine

a
presumption
I
could
not

one
day

horribly
out

he
destroy
the

to
avoid
tell
him

<EOS>
instead
of
receive
my
correction

he
answer
it
be
my
blunder

not
his

that
I
have
mistake
the
key

<EOS>
such
an
affront
from
my
own
scholar
be
beyond
human
patience

I
fly
into
a
violent
passion

I
fling
down
my
instrument
in
a
rage

I
be
not

teach
music

He
answer
,
with

much
warmth

dispute
end

the
purchase

twit
me

"
I
now
return
to
Rome
,
but
in
a
very
different
character
.
<EOS>
Fortune
have
now
allot
me
a
serious
part
to
act
.
<EOS>
I
have
even
in
my
infancy
a
grave
disposition
,
nor
be
I
ever
see
to
smile
,
which
infuse
an
opinion
into

about
me
that
I

a
child
of
great
solidity

some
foreseeing
that
I
should
be
a
judge
,

a
bishop

<EOS>
at
two
year
old
my
father
present
me
with
a
rattle
,
which
I
break
to
piece
with
great
indignation
.
<EOS>
this
the
good
parent
,
be
extremely
wise
,
regard
as
an
eminent
symptom
of
my
wisdom
,
and
cry
out
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
,
"
well
say
,
boy
!
<EOS>
I
warrant
thou
makest
a
great
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
at
school
I
could
never
be
persuade
to
play
with
my
mate
;
not
that
I
spend
my
hour
in
learning
,
to
which
I
be
not
in
the
least
addicted
,
nor
indeed
have
I
any
talent
for
it
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
solemnity
of
my
carriage
win
so
much
on
my
master
,
who
be
a
most
sagacious
person
,
that
I
be
his
chief
favorite
,
and
my
example
on
all
occasion
be
recommend
to
the
other
boy
,
which
fill
them
with
envy
,
and
me
with
pleasure
;
but
,
though
they
envy
me
,
they
all
pay
me
that
involuntary
respect
which
it
be
the
curse
attend
this
passion
to
bear
towards
its
object
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
now
obtain
universally
the
character
of
a
very
wise
young
man
,
which
I
do
not
altogether
purchase
without
pain
;
for
the
restraint
I
lay
on
myself
in
abstain
from
the
several
diversion
adapt
to
my
year
cost
me
many
a
yearning
;
but
the
pride
which
I
inwardly
enjoy
in
the
fancied
dignity
of
my
character
make
me
some
amend
.
  
<EOS>
"
thus
I
pass
on
,
without
anything
very
memorable
happen
to
me
,
till
I
arrive
at
the
age
of
twenty
-
three
,
when
unfortunately
I
fall
acquaint
with
a
young
Neapolitan
lady
whose
name
be
Ariadne
.
<EOS>
Her
beauty
be
so
exquisite
that
her
first
sight
make
a
violent
impression
on
me
;
this
be
again
improve
by
her
behavior
,
which
be
most
genteel
,
easy
,
and
affable
:
lastly
,
her
conversation
complete
the
conquest
.
<EOS>
in
this
she
discover
a
strong
and
lively
understanding
,
with
the
sweetest
and
most
benign
temper
.
<EOS>
this
lovely
creature
be
about
eighteen
when
I
first
unhappily
behold
her
at
Rome
,
on
a
visit
to
a
relation
with
whom
I
have
great
intimacy
.
<EOS>
as
our
interview
at
first
be
extremely
frequent
,
my
passion
be
captivate
before
I
apprehend
the
least
danger
;
and
the
sooner
probably
,
as
the
young
lady
herself
,
to
whom
I
consult
every
method
of
recommendation
,
be
not
displeased
with
my
be
her
admirer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ariadne
,
have
spend
three
month
at
Rome
,
now
return
to
Naples
,
bear
my
heart
with
her
:
on
the
other
hand
,
I
have
all
the
assurance
consistent
with
the
constraint
under
which
the
most
perfect
modesty
lay
a
young
woman
,
that
her
own
heart
be
not
entirely
unaffected
.
<EOS>
I
soon
find
her
absence
give
me
an
uneasiness
not
easy
to
be
bear
or
to
remove
.
<EOS>
I
now
first
apply
to
diversion
(
of
the
graver
sort
,
particularly
to
music
)
,
but
in
vain
;
they
rather
raise
my
desire
and
heighten
my
anguish
.
<EOS>
My
passion
at
length
grow
so
violent
,
that
I
begin
to
think
of
satisfy
it
.
<EOS>
as
the
first
step
to
this
,
I
cautiously
inquire
into
the
circumstance
of
Ariadne
's
parent
,
with
which
I
be
hitherto
unacquainted
:
though
,
indeed
,
I
do
not
apprehend
they
be
extremely
great
,
notwithstanding
the
handsome
appearance
of
their
daughter
at
Rome
.
<EOS>
upon
examination
,
her
fortune
exceed
my
expectation
,
but
be
not
sufficient
to
justify
my
marriage
with
her
,
in
the
opinion
of
the
wise
and
prudent
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
a
violent
struggle
between
wisdom
and
happiness
,
in
which
,
after
several
grievous
pang
,
wisdom
get
the
well
.
<EOS>
I
could
by
no
mean
prevail
with
myself
to
sacrifice
that
character
of
profound
wisdom
,
which
I
have
with
such
uniform
conduct
obtain
,
and
with
such
caution
hitherto
preserve
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
resolve
to
conquer
my
affection
,
whatever
it
cost
me
;
and
indeed
it
do
not
cost
me
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
while
I
be
engage
in
this
conflict
(
for
it
last
a
long
time
)
<EOS>
Ariadne
return
to
Rome
:
<EOS>
her
presence
be
a
terrible
enemy
to
my
wisdom
,
which
even
in
her
absence
have
with
great
difficulty
stand
its
ground
.
<EOS>
It
seem
(
as
she
hath
since
tell
me
in
Elysium
with
much
merriment
)
<EOS>
I
have
make
the
same
impression
on
her
which
she
have
make
on
me
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
believe
my
wisdom
would
have
be
totally
subdue
by
this
surprise
,
have
it
not
cunningly
suggest
to
me
a
method
of
satisfy
my
passion
without
do
any
injury
to
my
reputation
.
<EOS>
this
be
by
engage
her
privately
as
a
mistress
,
which
be
at
that
time
reputable
enough
at
Rome
,
provide
the
affair
be
manage
with
an
air
of
slyness
and
gravity
,
though
the
secret
be
know
to
the
whole
city
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
immediately
set
about
this
project
,
and
employ
every
art
and
engine
to
effect
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
particularly
bribe
her
priest
,
and
an
old
female
acquaintance
and
distant
relation
of
her
,
into
my
interest
:
but
all
be
in
vain
;
her
virtue
oppose
the
passion
in
her
breast
as
strongly
as
wisdom
have
oppose
it
in
mine
.
<EOS>
She
receive
my
proposal
with
the
utmost
disdain
,
and
presently
refuse
to
see
or
hear
from
me
any
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
return
again
to
Naples
,
and
leave
me
in
a
bad
condition
than
before
.
<EOS>
My
day
I
now
pass
with
the
most
irksome
uneasiness
,
and
my
night
be
restless
and
sleepless
.
<EOS>
the
story
of
our
amour
be
now
pretty
public
,
and
the
lady
talk
of
our
match
as
certain
;
but
my
acquaintance
deny
their
assent
,
say
,
"
no
,
no
,
he
be
too
wise
to
marry
so
imprudently
.
<EOS>
"
this
their
opinion
give
me
,
I
own
,
very
great
pleasure
;
but
,
to
say
the
truth
,
scarce
compensate
the
pang
I
suffer
to
preserve
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
one
day
,
while
I
be
balance
with
myself
,
and
have
almost
resolve
to
enjoy
my
happiness
at
the
price
of
my
character
,
a
friend
bring
me
word
that
Ariadne
be
married
.
<EOS>
this
news
strike
me
to
the
soul
;
and
though
I
have
resolution
enough
to
maintain
my
gravity
before
him
(
for
which
I
suffer
not
a
little
the
more
)
,
the
moment
I
be
alone
<EOS>
I
throw
myself
into
the
most
violent
fit
of
despair
,
and
would
willingly
have
part
with
wisdom
,
fortune
,
and
everything
else
,
to
have
retrieve
her
;
but
that
be
impossible
,
and
I
have
now
nothing
but
time
to
hope
a
cure
from
.
<EOS>
this
be
very
tedious
in
perform
it
,
and
the
long
as
Ariadne
have
marry
a
roman
cavalier
,
be
now
become
my
near
neighbor
,
and
I
have
the
mortification
of
see
her
make
the
good
of
wife
,
and
of
have
the
happiness
which
I
have
lose
,
every
day
before
my
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
suffer
so
much
on
account
of
my
wisdom
in
have
refuse
Ariadne
,
I
be
not
much
more
obliged
to
it
for
procure
me
a
rich
widow
,
who
be
recommend
to
me
by
an
old
friend
as
a
very
prudent
match
;
and
,
indeed
,
so
it
be
,
her
fortune
be
superior
to
mine
in
the
same
proportion
as
that
of
Ariadne
have
be
inferior
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
embrace
this
proposal
,
and
my
character
of
wisdom
soon
plead
so
effectually
for
me
with
the
widow
,
who
be
herself
a
woman
of
great
gravity
and
discretion
,
that
I
soon
succeed
;
and
as
soon
as
decency
would
permit
(
of
which
this
lady
be
the
strict
observer
)
<EOS>
we
be
married
,
be
the
second
day
of
the
second
week
of
the
second
year
after
her
husband
's
death
;
for
she
say
she
think
some
period
of
time
above
the
year
have
a
great
air
of
decorum
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
prudent
as
this
lady
be
,
she
make
me
miserable
.
<EOS>
Her
person
be
far
from
be
lovely
,
but
her
temper
be
intolerable
.
  
<EOS>
during
fifteen
year
'
habitation
,
I
never
pass
a
single
day
without
heartily
curse
her
,
and
the
hour
in
which
we
come
together
.
<EOS>
the
only
comfort
I
receive
,
in
the
midst
of
the
high
torment
,
be
from
continually
hear
the
prudence
of
my
match
commend
by
all
my
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
"
thus
you
see
,
in
the
affair
of
love
,
I
buy
the
reputation
of
wisdom
pretty
dear
.
<EOS>
in
other
matter
I
have
it
somewhat
cheap
;
not
that
hypocrisy
,
which
be
the
price
I
give
for
it
,
give
one
no
pain
.
<EOS>
I
have
refuse
myself
a
thousand
little
amusement
with
a
feign
contempt
,
while
I
have
really
have
an
inclination
to
them
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
almost
choke
myself
to
restrain
from
laugh
at
a
jest
,
and
(
which
be
perhaps
to
myself
the
least
hurtful
of
all
my
hypocrisy
)
have
heartily
enjoy
a
book
in
my
closet
which
I
have
speak
with
detestation
of
in
public
.
<EOS>
to
sum
up
my
history
in
short
,
as
I
have
few
adventure
worth
remember
,
my
whole
life
be
one
constant
lie
;
and
happy
would
it
have
be
for
me
if
I
could
as
thoroughly
have
impose
on
myself
as
I
do
on
other
:
for
reflection
,
at

enemy
to

indeed

a
weight
sufficient
to
counterbalance
all

false

whether

endeavor

retrieve
this
misfortune

reflect
on
the
great
number
of
priest
I
have
in

on
the
prodigious
force
of
superstition

a
thought
luckily
suggest
itself
to
me
,
to
counterfeit
that
St.
James
have
appear
to
me
in
a
vision
,

have
promise
me
the
victory

ruminate

come
opportunely

me

as
I
do
not
intend
to
communicate
the
secret
to
him

I
take
another
method

,
instead
of
answer
anything
the
bishop
say
to
me
,
I
pretend
to
talk
to
St.
James
,
as
if
he
have
be
really
present
;
till
at
length
,
after
have
speak
those
thing
which
I
think
sufficient
,
and
thank
the
saint
aloud
for
his
promise
of
the
victory

I
turn
about
to
the
bishop
,
and
,
embrace
him
with
a
pleased
countenance
,
protest
I
do
not
know
he
be
present
;
and
then
,
inform
him
of
this
suppose
vision
<EOS>
,
I
ask
him
if
he
have
not
himself
see
the
saint
?
<EOS>
He
answer
me
he
have
;
and
afterwards
proceed
to
assure
me
that
this
appearance
of
St.
James
be
entirely
owing
to
his
prayer
;
for
that
he
be
his
tutelar
saint
.
<EOS>
He
add
he
have
a
vision
of
him
a
few
hour
before
,
when
he
promise
him
a
victory
over
the
infidel
,
and
acquaint
him
at
the
same
time
of
the
vacancy
of
the
see
of
Toledo

now
,
this
news
be
really
true

it
have
happen
so
lately

I
have
not
hear
of
it
(
nor
<EOS>
,
indeed
,
be
it
well
possible

should
,
consider
the
great
distance
of
the
way

,
when
I
be
afterwards
acquaint
with
it
,
a
little
staggered
me
,
though
far
from
be
superstitious
;
till
be
inform
that
the
bishop
have
lose
three
horse
on
a
late
expedition

I
be
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
next
morning
,
the
bishop
,
at
my
desire
,
mount
the
rostrum
,
and
trumpet
forth
this
vision
so
effectually
,
which
he
say
he
have
that
evening
twice
see
with
his
own
eye
,
that
a
spirit
begin
to
be
infuse
through
the
whole
army

render
them
superior
to
almost
any
force

the
bishop
insist
that
the
least
doubt
of
success
be
give
the
lie
to
the
saint
,
and
a
damnable
sin
,

he
take
upon
him
in
his
name
to
promise
them
victory

out

the
effect

contrive
another
stratagem[9

to
strengthen
what
the
bishop
have
say

fight
more
like
fury
than
man

My
stratagem
be
this
:
I
have
about
me
a
dexterous
fellow

who
have
be
formerly
a
pimp
in

amours

Him
I
dress
up
in
a
strange
antic
dress

with
a
pair
of
white
color
in
his
right
hand
,
a
red
cross
in
his
left
,
and
have
disguise
him
so
that
no
one
could
know
him
,
I
place
him
on
a
white
horse
,
and
order
him
to
ride
to
the
head
of
the
army
,
and
cry
out
,
"
Follow
St.
James
!

<EOS>
these
word
be
reiterate
by
all
the
troop

who
attack
the
enemy
with
such
intrepidity

that
,
notwithstanding
our
inferiority
of
number
,
we
soon
obtain
a
complete
victory

up

with
such
acclamation
that
I
be
oblige
to
comply

them

I

I
have
now
do
with
the
saint

the
bishop
have
not
;
for
about
a
week
afterwards
light
be
see
in
a
wood
near
where
the
battle

in

short

make

go
thither

to

but
to
proceed
to
other
matter
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
inferior
officer
,
who
have
behave
very
bravely
in
the
battle
against
the
Moors
,
and
have
receive
several
wound
,
who
solicit
me
for
preferment
;
which
I
be
about
to
confer
on
him
,
when
one
of
my
minister
come
to
me
in
a
fright
,
and
tell
me
that
he
have
promise
the
post
I
design
for
this
man
to
the
son
of
count
Alderedo
;
and
that
the
count
,
who
be
a
powerful
person
,
would
be
greatly
disoblige
at
the
refusal
,
as
he
have
send
for
his
son
from
school
to
take
possession
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
agree
with
my
minister
's
reason
,
and
at
the
same
time
recommend
the
wounded
soldier
to
be
prefer
by
him
,
which
he
faithfully
promise
he
would
;
but
I
meet
the
poor
wretch
since
in
Elysium
,
who
inform
me
he
be
afterwards
starve
to
death

<EOS>

none
who
hath
not

himself

any
prince
till
his

can
conceive
the
imposition
daily
put
on
them
by
their
favorite

minister

that
prince
be
often
blame
for
the
fault
of

the
count
of
Saldagne

be
long
confine

his
son

D.
Bernard
del
Carpio

who
have
perform
the
great
action
against
the
Moors

entreat
me
,
as
a
reward
for
his
service

to
grant
him
his
father
's
liberty

<EOS>
the
old
man
's
punishment
have
be
so
tedious
,
and
the
service
of
the
young
one
so
singularly
eminent
,
that
I
be
very
inclinable
to
grant
the
request
;
but
my
minister
strongly
oppose
it
;
they
tell
me
my
glory
demand
revenge
for
the
dishonor
offer
to
my
family
;
that
so
positive
a
demand
carry
with
it
<EOS>
rather
the
air
of
menace
than
entreaty
;
that
the
vain
detail
of
his
service
,
and
the
recompense
due
to
them
,
be
an
injurious
reproach
;
that
to
grant
what
have
be
so
haughtily
demand
would
argue
in
the
monarch
both
weakness
and
timidity
;
in
a
word
,
that
to
remit
the
punishment
inflict
by
my
predecessor
would
be
to
condemn
their
judgment
.
<EOS>
lastly
,
one
tell
me
in
a
whisper
,
"
His
whole
family

enemy
to
your
house

"
by
these
mean
the
minister
prevail
.
<EOS>
the
young
lord
take
the
refusal
so
ill
,
that
he
retire
from
court
,
and
abandon
himself
to
despair
,
whilst
the
old
one
languish
in
prison
.
<EOS>
by
which
mean
,
as
I
have
since
discover
,
I
lose
the
use
of
two
of
my
good
subject

<EOS>
"
to
confess
the
truth
,
I
have
,
by
mean
of
my
minister
,
conceive
a
very
unjust
opinion
of
my
whole
people
,
whom
I
fancy
to
be
daily
conspire
against
me
,
and
to
entertain
the
most
disloyal
thought
,
when
,
in
reality
(
as
I
have
know
since
my
death
)
,
they
hold
me
in
universal
respect
and
esteem

<EOS>
this
be
a
trick
,
I
believe
,
too
often
play
with
sovereign
,
who
,
by
such
mean
,
be
prevent
from
that
open
intercourse
with
their
subject
which
,
as
it
would
greatly
endear
the
person
of
the
prince
to
the
people
,
so
may
it
often
prove
dangerous
to
a
minister
who
be
consult
his
own
interest
only
at
the
expense
of
both
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
have
now
recount
to
you
the
most
material
passage
of
my
life
;
for
I
assure
you
there
be
some
incident
in
the
life
of
king
not
extremely
worth
relate

everything
which
pass
in
their
mind

be
not

with
the
splendor
which
surround
their
throne
 
indeed
,
there
be
some
hour
wherein
the
naked
king
and
the
naked
cobbler
can
scarce
be
distinguish
from
each
other
.
  
<EOS>

have
it
not

,
however
,
for
my
ingratitude
to
Bernard
del
Carpio

I
believe
this
would
have
be
my
last
pilgrimage
on
earth
;
for
,
as
to
the
story
of
St.
James
,
I
think
Minos
would
have
burst
his
side
at
it
;
but
he
be
so
displeased
with
me
on
the
other
account
,
that
,
with
a
frown

he
cry
out

flattery

constantly
remind
me

by
my
mean
be
restore
to
the
favor
of
the
Simple
(
for
so
I
use
always
to
call
Charles
)

<EOS>
He
afterwards
prevail
with
the
king
to
take
the
city
of
Arras
from
earl
Baldwin

by
which
mean
,
Herbert
,
in
exchange
for
this
city

have
Peronne
restore
to
him
by

come
to
court
in
order

procure
the
restoration
of
his
city

,
either
through
pride

ignorance

neglect
to
apply
to
me

as
I
meet
him
at
court
during

solicitation

I
tell
him
he
do
not
apply
the
right
way

he
answer
roughly
he
should
not
ask
a
fool
's
advice

<EOS>
I
reply
I
do
not
wonder
at
his
prejudice

since
he
have
miscarry
already
by
follow
a
fool
's
advice

I
tell
him
there
be
fool
who
have
more
interest
than
that
he
have
bring
with
him
to
court

He
answer
me
surlily
he
have
no
fool
with

that
he

alone

<EOS>
this
raise
a
laugh
among
the
by
-
stander
,
on
which
he
give
me
a
blow
.
<EOS>
I
immediately
complain
of
this
usage
to
the
Simple
,
who
dismiss
the
earl
from
court
with
very
hard
word
,
instead
of
grant
him
the
favor
he
solicit
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
give
you
these
rather
as
a
speciman
of
my
interest
and
impudence
than
of
my
wit
 
indeed
,
my
jest
be
commonly
more
admired
than
they
ought
to
be
;
for
perhaps
I
be
not
in
reality
much
more
a
wit
than
a
fool
.
<EOS>
but
,
with
the
latitude
of
unbounded
scurrility
,
it
be
easy
enough
to
attain
the
character
of
wit
,
especially
in
a
court
,
where
,
as
all
person
hate
and
envy
one
another
heartily
,
and
be
at
the
same
time
oblige
by
the
constrain
behavior
of
civility
to
profess
the
great
liking

so
it
be
,
and
must
be

wonderfully
pleasant

see
the
folly
of
their
acquaintance
expose
by
a
third

the
opinion

fashion

always

Caligula

witty

word
I

raise
laughter

be
hold
to
be
a
jest

by
the
lady

who
sometimes
laugh
before
I

discover
my
sentiment

often
repeat
that
as
a
jest

I
do
not

intend
as
one

I
be
as
severe
on
the
lady
as
on
the
man

with
the

impunity

this
at
last
cost
me
dear

for
once
have
joke
on
the
beauty
of
a
lady
whose

be
Adelaide

a
favorite
of

she
pretend
to
smile
and
be
pleased
at
my
wit
with
the
rest
of
the
company

in
reality
she
highly
resent
it
,
and
endeavor
to
undermine
me
with
the
king

<EOS>
in
which
she
so
greatly
succeed
(
for
what
can
not
a
favorite
woman
do
with
one
who
deserve
the
surname
of
Simple
?

<EOS>
that
the
king
grow
every
day
more
reserved
to
me
,
and
when
I
attempt
any
freedom
give
me
such
mark
of
his
displeasure
,
that
the
courtier
who
have
all
hawk
'
eye
at
a
slight
from
the
sovereign
,
soon
discern
it
:
and
indeed
,
have
I
be
blind
enough
not
to
have
discover
that
I
have
lose
ground
in
the
Simple
's
favor
by
his
own
change
in
his
carriage
towards
me

I
must
have
find
it
,
nay

feel
it
,
in
the
behavior
of
the
courtier

for
,
as
my
company
be
two
day
before
solicit
with
the
utmost
eagerness
,
it
be
now
reject
with
as
much
scorn
.

I
be
now
the
jest
of
the
usher
and
page
;
and
an
officer
of
the
guard
,
on
whom
I
be
a
little
jocose
,
give
me
a
box
on
the
ear

bid
me
make
free
with
my
equal

very
fellow
have
be
my

year

lift
his

though
I
visibly
perceive
the
alteration
in

Simple

I
be
utterly
unable
to
make
any
guess
at
the
occasion

I
have
not
the
least
suspicion
of
Adelaide
;
for
,
besides
her
be
a
very
good

humored
woman

I
have
often
make
severe
jest
on
her
reputation

which
I
have
all
the
reason
imaginable
to
believe
have
give
her
no
offense
.

I
soon
perceive
that
a
woman
will
bear
the
most
bitter
censure
on
her
moral
easy
than
the
small
reflection
on
her
beauty
;
for
she
now
declare
publicly
,
that
I
ought
to
be
dismiss
from
court
,
as
the
stupid
of
fool
,
and
one
in
whom
there
be
no
diversion
;
and
that
she
wonder
how
any
person
could
have
so
little
taste
as
to
imagine
I
have
any
wit
.
<EOS>
this
speech
be
echo
through
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
agree
to
by
all
present
.
<EOS>
every
one
now
put
on
an
unusual
gravity
on
their
countenance
whenever
I
speak
;
and
it
be
as
much
out
of
my
power
to
raise
a
laugh
as
formerly
it
have
be
for
me
to
open
my
mouth
without
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
while
my
affair
be
in
this
posture
I
go
one
day
into
the
circle
without
my
fool
's

poor

numerous

honest

this

you

I

to
be
as
regular

to
have
its

rule

secret

to
learn
require
perhaps
as
tedious
an
apprenticeship
as

the
first
thing
we
be
teach
be
the
countenance
miserable

<EOS>
this
indeed
nature
make
much
easy
to
some
than

there
be
none
who
can
not
accomplish
it

they
begin
early

in

before
the

stubborn

lamentable

go

these

considerable

<EOS>
the

teach
one

more

they
be
instruct
in
the
art
of
crying

that
is
,
to
have
their
tear
ready
on
all
occasion

this

attain
very
easily
by

indeed
arrive
at
the
utmost
perfection
in
this
art
with
incredible
facility

<EOS>

no

require
a
deep
insight
into
human
nature
than
the
beggar
's
.
<EOS>
Their
knowledge
of
the
passion
of
man
be
so
extensive
,
that
I
have
often
think
it
would
be
of
no
little
service
to
a
politician
to
have
his
education
among
them
.
<EOS>
nay
,
there
be
a
much
great
analogy
between
these
two
character
than
be
imagine
;
for
both
concur
in
their
first
and
grand
principle
,
it
be
equally
their
business
to
delude
and
impose
on
mankind
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
confess
that
they
differ
widely
in
the
degree
of
advantage
which
they
make
by
their
deceit
;
for
,
whereas
the
beggar
be
content
with
a
little
,
the
politician
leave

a
little
behind

a
very
great
English

remark
our
policy
,

take
care
never
to
address
any
one
with
a
title
inferior
to
what
he
really
claim
.
<EOS>
My
father
be
of
the
same
opinion
;
for
I
remember
when
I
be
a
boy
,
the
pope
happen
to
pass
by
,
I
tend
him
with
"
Pray

sir
;
"
"
for
God
's
sake
,
sir
;
"
"
for
the
Lord
's
sake

sir
;

to
which
he
answer
gravely

"

ought

be

the

in
vain

be
indeed
,
for
he
give
me
nothing
.

My
father

overhear
this
,
take
his
advice
,
and
whip
me
very
severely
.

I
be
under
correction
I
promise
often
never

take
the
Lord
's

<EOS>
My

then
say
,

I
do
not

if
all

be
so
wise

good
to
follow
the
clergy

example

the
nuisance
of
beggar
would
soon
be
remove

<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
to
have
be
above
twice
relieve
by
them
during
my
whole
state
of
beggary
.
<EOS>
once
be
by
a
very
well
-
looking
man
,
who
give
me
a
small
piece
of
silver
,
and
declare
he
have
give
me
more
than
he
have
leave
himself
;
the
other
be
by
a
spruce
young
fellow
,
who
have
that
very
day
first
put
on
his
robe
,
whom
I
attend
with
"

He
answer
,
"
I
do
,
child
,
consider
my
office
,
and
I
hope
all
our
cloth
do
the
same
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
throw
down
some
money
,
and
strut
off
with
great
dignity
.
   
<EOS>
"
with
the
woman
I
have
one
general
formulary
:
"
Sweet
pretty
lady
,
<EOS>
"
"
God
bless
your
ladyship
,
"
"
God
bless
your
handsome
face

generally
succeed

I

uglier

the
surer
I
be
of
success
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
constant
maxim
among
us
,
that
the
great
retinue
any
one
travel
with
the
less
expectation
we
may
promise
ourselves
from
them
;
but
whenever
we
see
a
vehicle
with
a
single
or
no
servant
we
imagine
our
booty
sure
,
and
be
seldom
deceive
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
observe
great
difference
introduce
by
time
and
circumstance
in
the
same
person
;
for
instance
,
a
lose
gamester
be
sometimes
generous
,
but
from
a
winner
you
will
as
easily
obtain
his
soul
as
a
single
groat

lawyer
travel
from
his
country
seat
to
his
client
at
Rome

and
a
physician
go
to
visit
a
patient

be
always
worth
ask
;
but
the
same
on
their
return
be
(
accord
to
our
can
not
phrase
)
untouchable
.
   
<EOS>
"
the
most
general
,
and
<EOS>
indeed
the
true
,
maxim
among
us
be
,
that
those
who
possess
the
least
be
always
the
readiest
to
give
.
<EOS>
the
chief
art
of
a
beggar
-
man
be
,
therefore
,
to
discern
the
rich
from
the
poor
,
which
,
though
it
be
only
distinguish
substance
from
shadow
,
be
by
no
mean
attainable
without
a
pretty
good
capacity
and
a
vast
degree
of
attention
;
for
these
two
be
eternally
industrious
in
endeavor
to
counterfeit
each
other
.
<EOS>
in
this
deceit
the
poor
man
be
more
heartily
in
earnest
to
deceive
you
than
the
rich
,
who
,
amidst
all
the
emblem
of
poverty
which
he
put
on
,
still
permit
some
mark
of
his
wealth
to
strike
the
eye
.
<EOS>
thus
,
while
his
apparel
be
not
worth
a
groat
,
his
finger
wear
a
ring
of
value
,
or
his
pocket
a
gold
watch
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
he
seem
rather
to
affect
poverty
to
insult
than
impose
on
you
.
<EOS>
now
the
poor
man
,
on
the
contrary
,
be
very
sincere
in
his
desire
of
pass
for
rich
;
but
the
eagerness
of
this
desire
hurry
him
to
over
-
act
his
part
,
and
he
betray
himself
as
one
who
be
drunk
by
his
overact
sobriety
.
<EOS>
thus
,
instead
of
be
attend
by
one
servant
well
mounted
,
he
will
have
two
;
and
,
not
be
able
to
purchase
or
maintain
a
second
horse
of
value
,
one
of
his
servant
at
least
be
mount
on
a
hire
rascallion
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
content
to
go
plain
and
neat
in
his
clothe
;
he
therefore
clap
on
some
tawdry
ornament
,
and
what
he
add
to
the
fineness
of
his
vestment
he
detract
from
the
fineness
of
his
linen
.
<EOS>
without
descend
into
more
minute
particular
,
I
believe
I
may
assert
it
as
an
axiom
of
indubitable
truth
,
that
whoever
show
you
he
be
either
in
himself
or
his
equipage
as
gaudy
as
he
can
,
convince
you
he
be
more
so
than
he
can
afford
.
<EOS>
now
,
whenever
a
man
's
expense
exceed
his
income
,
he
be
indifferent
in
the
degree
;
we
have
therefore
nothing
more
to
do
with
such
than
to
flatter
them
with
their
wealth
and
splendor
,
and
be
always
certain
of
success

her
design

I
have
no

Alfred
in

I
cause
him
to
be
conduct
to
Ely

I
order
his

stipulate
condition

one

to

my

Editha

Edward
consent
to
with
great
reluctance

I
have
afterwards
no
reason
to
be
pleased
with
it

it
raise
her

who
have
be
my
favorite
child

to
such
an
opinion

greatness

that
,
instead
of
pay
me
the

she
frequently
throw
in

tooth

as
often
at

I
give
her
any
admonition

that
she
be
now
a
queen

that
the
character
and
title
of
father
merge
in

of
subject

this
behavior

do
not
cure
me

my
affection

uneasiness

I

one
thing

principally
induce
me

the
simplicity

weakness
of
that

under
whom
I
promise
myself
absolute
dominion
under
another
name

nor
do
this
opinion
deceive
me
;
for
,
during
his
whole
reign
,
my
administration
be
in
the
high
degree
despotic
:
I
have
everything
of
royalty
but
the
outward
ensign
;
no
man
ever
apply
for
a
place
,
or
any
kind
of
preferment

to
me
only
.

a
circumstance
which
,
as
it
greatly
enrich
my
coffer
,
so
it
no
less
pamper
my
ambition
,
and
satisfy
my
vanity
with
a
numerous
attendance

I
have
the
pleasure
of
see
those
who
only
bow
to
the
king
prostrate
themselves
before
me

Edward
the
Confessor

St.
Edward

some
have
call
him
<EOS>

in
derision
I
suppose
,
be
a
very
silly
fellow

have
all
the
fault
incident

almost
inseparable

to
fool

He
marry
my
daughter
Editha

his
fear

disoblige
me

afterwards
,
out
of
hatred
to
me
,
refuse
even
to
consummate
his
marriage
,
though
she
be
one
of
the
most
beautiful
woman

her
age

be
likewise
guilty
of
the
base
ingratitude
to
his

a
vice
to
which
fool
be
chiefly

liable

procure
him
a
throne

her
in

loathsome
prison

old
age

he
do
by
my
advice

as
to
her
walk
over
nine
plowshare

hot

give
nine
manor

have
not

of
veracity
in
it

<EOS>
"
the
first
great
perplexity
I
fall
into
be
on
the
account
of
my
son
Swane
,
who
have
deflower
the
abbess
of
Leon
,
since
call
Leominster
,
in
Herefordshire
.
<EOS>
after
this
fact
he
retire
into
Denmark
,
whence
<EOS>
he
send
to
me
to
obtain
his
pardon
.
<EOS>
the
king
at
first
refuse
it
,
be
move
thereto
,
as
I
afterwards
find
,
by
some
churchman
,
particularly
by
one
of
his
chaplain
,
whom
I
have
prevent
from
obtain
a
bishopric
.
<EOS>
upon
this
my
son
Swane
invade
the
coast
with
several
ship
,
and
commit
many
outrageous
cruelty
;
which
,
indeed
,
do
his
business
,
as
they
serve
me
to
apply
to
the
fear
of
this
king
,
which
I
have
long
since
discover
to
be
his
predominant
passion
.
<EOS>
and
,
at
last
,
he
who
have
refuse
pardon
to
his
first
offense
submit
to
give
it
him
after
he
have
commit
many
other
more
monstrous
crime
;
by
which
his
pardon
lose
all
grace
to
the
offend
,
and
receive
double
censure
from
all
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
king
be
greatly
inclined
to
the
Normans
,
have
create
a
Norman
archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
and
have
heap
extraordinary
favor
on
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
other
objection
to
this
man
than
that
he
rise
without
my
assistance
;
a
cause
of
dislike
which
,
in
the
reign
of
great

powerful
favorite

hath
often
prove
fatal
to
the
person
who
have
give
it

the
person
thus
raise
inspire
us
constantly
with
jealousy

apprehension

<EOS>
for
when
we
promote
any
one
ourselves
,
we
take
effectual
care
to
preserve
such
an
ascendant
over
him
,
that
we
can
at
any
time
reduce
him
to
his
former
degree
,
should
he
dare
to
act
in
opposition
to
our
will

for
which
reason
we
never
suffer
any
to
come
near
the
prince

such
as
we

assure
it
be
impossible
should
be
capable
of
engage

improve
his
affection

prime
minister

as
I
apprehend

esteem
himself
to
be
safe
while
any
other
share
the
ear
of
his
prince
,
of
whom
we
be
as
jealous
as
the
fond
husband
can
be
of
his
wife

,
therefore
,
can
approach
him

any
other
channel

enemy

first
principle
of
policy
oblige
us
to
demolish
with
the
utmost
expedition
.

the
affection
of
king

as
precarious
as
that
of
woman

the
only
way
to
secure
either
to
ourselves

to
keep
all
other
from
them

but
the
archbishop
do
not
let
matter
rest
on
suspicion

<EOS>
He
soon
give
open
proof
of
his
interest
with
the
Confessor
in
procure
an
office
of
some
importance
for
one
Rollo
,
a
roman
of
mean
extraction
and
very
despicable
part
.
<EOS>
when
I
represent
to
the
king
the
indecency
of
confer
such
an
honor
on
such
a
fellow
,
he
answer
me
that
he
be
the
archbishop
's
relation

reply
I
,
"
he
be

your
enemy

<EOS>
"
nothing
more
pass
at
that
time
;
but
I
soon
perceive
,
by
the
archbishop
's
behavior
,
that
the
king
have
acquaint
him
with
our
private
discourse

a
sufficient
assurance

his
confidence

neglect
of

terrible

indeed

be
originally
found

out

in

spot

there

narrowly

affront

loud
complaint

satisfaction

chastise
the
rioter

who
be
under
my
government

earl
of
Kent

,
instead
of
obey
these
order

I
answer
,
with
some
warmth

that
the
English
be
not
use
to
punish
people
unheard

ought
their
right

guilty

should
make
satisfaction
both
with
body
and
estate
,
but
,
if
innocent

should
be
discharge

<EOS>
add
,
with
great
ferocity

that
as
earl
of
Kent
<EOS>
it
be
my
duty
to
protect
those
under

the
insult

readily

Pemsey

in
Sussex

be
present
at
the
famous
battle
of
Hastings
.
  
<EOS>
"
at
the
first
onset
it
be
impossible
to
describe
my
consternation
,
which
be
heighten
by
the
fall
of
two
soldier
who
stand
by
me
;
but
this
soon
abate
,
and
by
degree
,
as
my
blood
grow
warm
,
I
think
no
more
of
my
own
safety
,
but
fall
on
the
enemy
with
great
fury
,
and
do
a
good
deal
of
execution
<EOS>
;
till
,
unhappily
,
I
receive
a
wound
in
my
thigh
,
which
render
me
unable
to
stand
any
longer
,
so
that
I
now
lie
among
the
dead
,
and
be
constantly
expose
to
the
danger
of
be
trample
to
death
,
as
well
by
my
fellow
-
soldier
as
by
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
have
the
fortune
to
escape
it
,
and
continue
the
remain
part
of
the
day
and
the
night
follow
on
the
ground

<EOS>
"
the
next
morning
,
the
duke
send
out
party
to
bring
off
the
wound

I
be
find
almost
expire
with
loss
of
blood

notwithstanding
which
,
as
immediate
care
be
take
to
dress
my
wound
,
youth
and
a
robust
constitution
<EOS>
stand
my
friend

and
I
recover
after
a
long
and
tedious
indisposition
,

be
again
able
to
use
my
limb
and
do
my
duty

<EOS>
"
as
soon
as
Dover
be
take
I
be
convey
thither
with
all
the
rest
of
the
sick
and
wounded
.
<EOS>
here
I
recover
of
my
wound
;
but
fall
afterwards
into
a
violent
flux
,
which
,
when
it
depart
,
leave
me
so
weak
that
it
be
long
before
I
could
regain
my
strength
.
<EOS>
and
what
most
afflict
me
be
,
that
during
my
whole
illness
,
when
I
languish
under
want
as
well
as
sickness
,
I
have
daily
the
mortification
to
see
and
hear
the
riot
and
excess
of
my
fellow
-
soldier
,
who
have
happily
escape
safe
from
the
battle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
no
sooner
well
than
I
be
order
into
garrison
at
Dover
Castle
.
<EOS>
the
officer
here
fare
very
indifferently
,
but
the
private
man
much
bad
.
<EOS>
We
have
great
scarcity
of
provision
,
and
,
what
be
yet
more
intolerable
,
be
so
closely
confine
for
want
of
room
(
four
of
us
be
oblige
to
lie
on
the
same
bundle
of
straw
)
,
that
many
die
,
and
most
sickened
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
I
have
remain
about
four
month
,
when
one
night
we
be
alarm
with
the
arrival
of
the
earl
of
Boulogne
,
who
have
come
over
privily
from
France
,
and
endeavor
to
surprise
the
castle
.
<EOS>
the
design
prove
ineffectual
;
for
the
garrison
make
a
brisk
sally
,
most
of
his
man
be
tum-
bleed
down
the
precipice
,
and
he
return
with
a
very
few
back
to
France
.
<EOS>
in
this
action
,
however
,
I
have
the
misfortune
to
come
off
with
a
broken
arm
;
it
be
so
shatter
,
that
,
besides
a
great
deal
of
pain
and
misery
which
I
endure
in
my
cure
,
I
be
disabled
for
upward
of
three
month
.
  
<EOS>
"
soon
after
my
recovery
I
have
contract
an
amour
with
a
young
woman
whose
parent
live
near
the
garrison
,
and
be
in
much
well
circumstance
than
I
have
reason
to
expect
should
give
their
consent
to
the
match
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
she
be
extremely
fond
of
me
(
as
I
be
indeed
distractedly
enamored
of
her
)
,
they
be
prevail
on
to
comply
with
her
desire
,
and
the
day
be
fix
for
our
marriage

on
the
evening
precede

while
I
be
exult
with
the
eager
expectation
of
the
happiness
<EOS>
I
be
the
next
day
to
enjoy
<EOS>
,
I
receive
order
to
march
early
in
the
morning
towards
Windsor
,
where
a
large
army
be
to
be
form
,
at
the
head
of
which
the
king
intend
to
march
into
the
west

any
person
who
hath
ever
be
in
love
may
easily
imagine
what
I
feel
in
my
mind
on
receive
those
order
;
and
what
still
heighten
my
torment
be
,
that
the
command
officer
would
not
permit
any
one
to
go
out
of
the
garrison
that
evening
;
so
that
I
have
not
even
an
opportunity
of
take
leave
of
my
beloved
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
morning
come
which
be
to
have
put
me
in
the
possession
of
my
wish
;
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
the
scene
be
now
change
,
and
all
the
hope
which
I
have
raise
be
now
so
many
ghost
to
haunt
,
and
fury
to
torment
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
now
the
midst
of
winter
,
and
very
severe
weather
for
the
season
;
when
we
be
oblige
to
make
very
long
and
fatiguing
marche
,
in
which
we
suffer
all
the
inconvenience
of
cold
and
hunger
.
<EOS>
the
night
in
which
I
expect
to
riot
in
the
arm
of
my
beloved
mistress
I
be
oblige
to
take
up
with
a
lodging
on
the
ground
,
expose
to
the
inclemency
of
a
rigid
frost
;
nor
could
I
obtain
the
least
comfort
of
sleep
,
which
shun
me
as
its
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
the
horror
of
that
night
be
not
to
be
describe
,
or
perhaps
imagine
.
<EOS>
They
make
such
an
impression
on
my
soul
,
that
I
be
force
to
be
dip
three
time
in
the
river
Lethe
to
prevent
my
remember
it
in
the
character
which
I
afterwards
perform
in
the
flesh
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
I
interrupt
Julian
for
the
first
time
,
and
tell
him
no
such
dipping
have
happen
to
me
in
my
voyage
from
one
world
to
the
other
:
but
he
satisfy
me
by
say
"
that
this
only
happen
to
those
spirit
which
return
into
the
flesh
,
in
order
to
prevent
that
reminiscence
which
Plato
mention
,
and
which
would
otherwise
cause
great
confusion
in
the
other
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
then
proceed
as
follow
:
"
We
continue
a
very
laborious
march
to
Exeter
,
which
we
be
order
to
besiege
.
<EOS>
the
town
soon
surrender
,
and
his
majesty
build
a
castle
there
,
which
he
garrison
with
his
Normans
,
and
unhappily
I
have
the
misfortune
to
be
one
of
the
number
.
   
<EOS>
"
here
we
be
confine
closer
than
I
have
be
at
Dover
;
for
,
as
the
citizen
be
extremely
disaffected
,
we
be
never
suffer
to
go
without
the
wall
of
the
castle
;
nor
indeed
could
we
,
unless
in
large
body
,
without
the
utmost
danger

<EOS>
We
be
likewise
keep
to
continual
duty
,
nor
could
any
solicitation
prevail
with
the
command
officer
to
give
me
a
month
's
absence
to
visit
my
love
,
from
whom
I
have
no
opportunity

hearing
in
all
my
long
absence

"
however
,
in
the
spring
,
the
people
be
more
quiet
,
and
another
officer
of
a
gentle
temper
succeed
to
the
principal
command
,
I
obtain
leave
to
go
to
Dover
;
but
alas
!
<EOS>
what
comfort
do
my
long
journey
bring
me
?
<EOS>
I
find
the
parent
of
my
darling
in
the
utmost
misery
at
her
loss
;
for
she
have
die
,
about
a
week
before
my
arrival
,
of
a
consumption
,
which
they
impute
to
her
pining
at
my
sudden
departure
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
now
fall
into
the
most
violent
and
almost
rave
fit
of
despair
.
<EOS>
I
curse
myself
,
the
king
,
and
the
whole
world
,
which
no
longer
seem
to
have
any
delight
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
throw
myself
on
the
grave
of
my
deceased
love
,
and
lie
there
without
any
kind
of
sustenance
for
two
whole
day
.
<EOS>
at
last
hunger
,
together
with
the
persuasion
of
some
people
who
take
pity
on
me
,
prevail
with
me
to
quit
that
situation
,
and
refresh
myself
with
food
.
<EOS>
They
then
persuade
me
to
return
to
my
post
,
and
abandon
a
place
where
almost
every
object
I
see
recall
idea
to
my
mind
which
,
as
they
say
,
I
should
endeavor
with
my
utmost
force
to
expel
from
it
.
<EOS>
this
advice
at
length
succeed
;
the
rather
,
as
the
father
and
mother
of
my
beloved
refuse
to
see
me
,
look
on
me
as
the
innocent
but
certain
cause
of
the
death
of
their
only
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
loss
of
one
we
tenderly
love
,
as
it
be
one
of
the
most
bitter
and
biting
evil
which
attend
human
life
,
so
it
want
the
lenitive
which
palliate
and
soften
every
other
calamity
;
I
mean
that
great
reliever
,
hope
.
<EOS>
no
man
can
be
so
totally
undone
,
but
that
he
may
still
cherish
expectation
:
but
this
deprive
us
of
all
such
comfort
,
nor
can
anything
but
time
alone
lessen
it
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
in
most
mind
,
be
sure
to
work
a
slow
but
effectual
remedy
;
so
do
it
in
mine
:
for
within
a
twelve
-
month
I
be
entirely
reconcile
to
my
fortune
,
and
soon
after
absolutely
forget
the
object
of
a
passion
from
which
I
have
promise
myself
such
extreme
happiness
,
and
in
the
disappointment
of
which
I
have
experience
such
inconceivable
misery
.
   
<EOS>
"
at
the
expiration
of
the
month
I
return
to
my
garrison
at
Exeter
;
where
I
be
no
sooner
arrive
than
I
be
order
to
march
into
the
north
,
to
oppose
a
force
there
levy
by

earl
of
Chester

Northumberland

<EOS>
We
come
to
York
,
where
his
majesty
pardon
the
head
of
the
rebel
,
and
very
severely
punish
some
who
be
less
guilty

<EOS>
It
be
particularly
my
lot
to
be
order
to
seize
a
poor
man
who
have
never
be
out
of
his
house
,
and
convey
him
to
prison

<EOS>
I
detest
this
barbarity
,
yet
be
oblige
to
execute
it
;
nay
,
though
no
reward
would
have
bribe
me
in
a
private
capacity
to
have
act
such
a
part
,
yet
so
much
sanctity
be
there
in
the
command
of
a
monarch
or
general
to
a
soldier
,
that
I
perform
it
without
reluctance
,
nor
have
the
tear
of
his
wife
and
family
any
prevalence
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
this
,
which
be
a
very
small
piece
of
mischief
in
comparison
with
many
of
my
barbarity
afterwards
,
be
however
,
the
only
one
which
ever
give
me
any
uneasiness

for
when
the
king
lead
us
afterwards
into
Northumberland
to
revenge
those
people

have
join
with
Osborne
the
Dane
in
his
invasion

give
us
to
commit
what
ravage
we
could

I
be
forward
in
fulfil
them
,
and
,
among
some
less
cruelty
(
I
remember
it
yet
with
sorrow

,
I
ravish
a
woman
,
murder
a
little
infant
playing
in
her
lap
,
and
then
burn
her
house

<EOS>
in
short

for
I
have
no
pleasure
in
this
part

my
share
in

what
happen
to
Julian
in
the
person
of
a
tailor

<EOS>
"
Fortune
now
station
me
in
a
character
which
the
ingratitude
of
mankind
hath
put
them
on
ridicule
,
though
they
owe
to
it
not
only
a
relief
from
the
inclemency
of
cold
,
to
which
they
would
otherwise
be
expose
,
but
likewise
a
considerable
satisfaction
of
their
vanity
.
<EOS>
the
character
I
mean
be
that
of
a
tailor
;
which
,
if
we
consider
it
with
due
attention
,
must
be
confess
to
have
in
it
great
dignity
and
importance

<EOS>
for
,
in
reality
,
who
constitute
the
different
degree
between
man
but
the
tailor
?
<EOS>
the
prince
indeed
give
the
title
,
but
it
be
the
tailor
who
make
the
man
.
<EOS>
to
his
labor
be
owe
the
respect
of
crowd
,
and
the
awe
which
great
man
inspire
into
their
beholder
,
though
these
be
too
often
unjustly
attribute
to
other
motive
.

,
the
admiration
of

most
commonly

his
account

coat
hath
so
much
pleasure

vanity
in

admire
in

admiration

I
bustle
on
the
day
of
the
ceremony
through
the
crowd

it
be
with
incredible
delight

I
hear
several
say
,
as
my
clothe
walk
by

"
bless
me

be
ever
anything
so
fine
as
the
earl
of
Devonshire

sure
he
and
Sir
Hugh
Bigot
be
the
two
good

man
I
ever

now
both
those

be
of
my
making

<EOS>
"
there
would
indeed
be
infinite
pleasure
in
work
for
the
courtier
,
as
they
be
generally
genteel
man
,
and
show
one
's
clothe
to
the
good
advantage
,
be
it
not
for
one
small
discouragement
;
this
be
,
that
they
never
pay
.
<EOS>
I
solemnly
protest
,
though
I
lose
almost
as
much
by
the
court
in
my
life
as
I
get
by
the
city
,
I
never
carry
a
suit
into
the
latter
with
half
the
satisfaction
which
I
have
do
to
the
former
;
though
from
that
I
be
certain
of
ready
money
,
and
from
this
almost
as
certain
of
no
money
at
all

<EOS>
"
Courtiers
may
,
however
,
be
divide
into
two
sort
,
very
essentially
different
from
each
other
;
into
those
who
never
intend
to
pay
for
their
clothe
;
and
those
who
do
intend
to
pay
for
them
,
but
never
happen
to
be
able
.
<EOS>
of
the
latter
sort
be
many
of
those
young
gentleman
whom
we
equip
out
for
the
army
,
and
who
be
,
unhappily
for
us
,
cut
off
before
they
arrive
at
preferment
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
reason
that
tailor
,
in
time
of
war
,
be
mistake
for
politician
by
their
inquisitiveness
into
the
event
of
battle
,
one
campaign
very
often
prove
the
ruin
of
half
-
a
-
dozen
of
us
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
have
frequent
reason
to
curse
that
fatal
battle
of
Cardigan
,
where
the
Welsh
defeat
some
of
king
Stephen
's
good
troop
,
and
where
many
a
good
suit
of
mine
unpaid
for
,
fall
to
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
gentleman
of
this
honorable
calling
have
fare
much
well
in
later
age
than
when
I
be
of
it
;
for
now
it
seem
the
fashion
be
,
when
they
apprehend
their
customer
be
not
in
the
good
circumstance
,
if
they
be
not
pay
as
soon
as
they
carry
home
the
suit
,
they
charge
him
in
their
book
as
much
again
as
it
be
worth
,
and
then
send
a
gentleman
with
a
small
scrip
of
parchment
to
demand
the
money
.
<EOS>
if
this
be
not
immediately
pay
the
gentleman
take
the
beau
with
him
to
his
house
,
where
he
lock
him
up
till
the
tailor
be
content
:
but
in
my
time
these
scrip
of
parchment
be
not
in
use
;
and
if
the
beau
dislike
pay
for
his
clothe
,
as
very
often
happen
,
we
have
no
method
of
compel
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
several
of
the
character
which
I
have
relate
to
you
,
I
apprehend
I
have
sometimes
forget
myself
,
and
consider
myself
as
really
interested
as
I
be
when
I
personate
them
on
earth
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
now
catch
myself
in
the
fact
;
for
I
have
complain
to
you
as
bitterly
of
my
customer
as
I
formerly
use
to
do
when
I
be
the
tailor
:
<EOS>
but
in
reality
,
though
there
be
some
few
person
of
very
great
quality
,
and
some
other
,
who
never
pay
their
debt
,
yet
those
be
but
a
few
,
and
I
have
a
method
of
repair
this
loss
.
<EOS>
My
customer
I
divide
under
three
head
:
those
who
pay
ready
money
,
those
who
pay
slow
,
and
those
who
never
pay
at
all
.
<EOS>
the
first
of
these
I
consider
apart
by
themselves
,
as
person
by
whom
I
get
a
certain
but
small
profit
.
<EOS>
the
two
last
I
lump
together
,
make
those
who
pay
slow
contribute
to
repair
my
loss
by
those
who
do
not
pay
at
all
.
<EOS>
thus
,
upon
the
whole
,
I
be
a
very
inconsiderable
loser
,
and
may
have
leave
a
fortune
to
my
family
,
have
I
not
launch
forth
into
expense
which
swallow
up
all
my
gain
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
wife
and
two
child
.
<EOS>
these
indeed
I
keep
frugally
enough
,
for
I
half
starve
them
;
but
I
keep
a
mistress
in
a
fine
way
,
for
whom
I
have
a
country
-
house
,
pleasantly
situate
on
the
Thames
,
elegantly
fit
up
and
neatly
furnished
.
<EOS>
this
woman
may
very
properly
be
call
my
mistress
,
for
she
be
most
absolutely
so
;
and
though
her
tenure
be
no
high
than
by
my
will
,
she
domineer
as
tyrannically
as
if
my
chain
have
be
rivet
in
the
strong
manner
.
<EOS>
to
all
this
I
submit
,
not
through
any
adoration
of
her
beauty
,
which
be
indeed
but
indifferent
.
<EOS>
Her
charm
consist
in
little
wantonness
,
which
she
know
admirably
well
to
use
in
hour
of
dalliance
,
and
which
,
I
believe
,
be
of
all
thing
the
most
delightful
to
a
lover
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
so
profusely
extravagant
,
that
it
seem
as
if
she
have
an
actual
intent
to
ruin
me
.
<EOS>
this
I
be
sure
of
,
if
such
have
be
her
real
intention
,
she
could
have
take
no
properer
way
to
accomplish
it
;
nay
,
I
myself
may
appear
to
have
have
the
same
view
:
<EOS>
for
,
besides
this
extravagant
mistress
and
my
country
-
house
,
I
keep
likewise
a
brace
of
hunter
,
rather
for
that
it
be
fashionable
so
to
do
than
for
any
great
delight
I
take
in
the
sport
,
which
I
very
little
attend
;
not
for
want
of
leisure
,
for
few
nobleman
have
so
much
.
<EOS>
all
the
work
I
ever
do
be
take
measure
,
and
that
only
of
my
great
and
good
customer
.
<EOS>
I
scare
ever
cut
a
piece
of
cloth
in
my
life
,
nor
be
indeed
much
more
able
to
fashion
a
coat
than
any
gentleman
in
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
this
make
a
skillful
servant
too
necessary
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
know
I
must
submit
to
any
term
with
,
or
any
treatment
from
,
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
know
it
be
easy
for
him
to
find
another
such
a
tailor
as
me
than
for
me
to
procure
such
another
workman
as
him
:
for
this
reason
he
exert
the
most
notorious
and
cruel
tyranny
,
seldom
give
me
a
civil
word
;
nor
could
the
utmost
condescension
on
my
side
,
though
attend
with
continual
present
and
reward
,
and
raise
his
wage
,
content
or
please
him
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
he
be
as
absolutely
my
master
as
be
ever
an
ambitious
,
industrious
prime
minister
over
an
indolent
and
voluptuous
king
.
<EOS>
all
my
other
journeyman
pay
more
respect
to
him
than
to
me
;
for
they
consider
my
favor
as
a
necessary
consequence
of
obtain
his
.
  
<EOS>
"
these
be
the
most
remarkable
occurrence
while
I
act
this
part
.
<EOS>

hesitate
a
few
moment

me
get
back
again

indolently
suffer

nothing

to
keep

shut

,
alas

<EOS>
my
rhetoric
have
not
the
effect
I
propose
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
of
my
argument
be
only
contempt
to
myself
.
<EOS>
the
people
at
first
stare
on
one
another
,
and
afterwards
begin
unanimously
to
express
their
dislike
.
<EOS>
an
impudent
fellow
among
them
,
reflect
on
my
trade
,
cry
out
,
"
stink
fish
;
"
which
be
immediately
reiterate
through
the
whole
crowd
.
<EOS>
I
be
then
force
to
slink
away
home
;
but
I
be
not
able
to
accomplish
my
retreat
without
be
attend
by
the
mob
,
who
huzza'd
me
along
the
street
with
the
repeat
cry
of
"
stink
fish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
now
proceed
to
court
,
to
inform
his
majesty
of
my
faithful
service
,
and
how
much
I
have
suffer
in
his
cause
.
<EOS>
I
find
by
my
first
reception
he
have
already
hear
of
my
success
.
<EOS>
instead
of
thank
me
for
my
speech
,
he
say
the
city
should
repent
of
their
obstinacy
,
for
that
he
would
show
them
who
he
be
:
<EOS>
and
so
say
,
he
immediately
turn
that
part
to
me
to
which
the
toe
of
man
hath
<EOS>
so
wonderful
an
affection
,
that
it
be
very
difficult
,
whenever
it
present
itself
conveniently
,
to
keep
our
toe
from
the
most
violent
and
ardent
salutation
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
a
little
nettle
at
this
behavior
,
and
with
some
earnestness
claim
the
king
's
fulfil
his
promise
;
but
he
retire
without
answer
me
.
<EOS>
I
then
apply
to
some
of
the
courtier
,
who
have
lately
profess
great
friendship
to
me
,
have
eat
at
my
house
,
and
invite
me
to
theirs
:
but
not
one
would
return
me
any
answer
,
all
run
away
from
me
as
if
I
have
be
seize
with
some
contagious
distemper
.
<EOS>
I
now
find
by
experience
,
that
as
none
can
be
so
civil
,
so
none
can
be
rude
than
a
courtier
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
few
moment
after
the
king
's
retire
I
be
leave
alone
in
the
room
to
consider
what
I
should
do
or
whither
I
should
turn
myself
.
<EOS>
My
reception
in
the
city
promise
itself
to
be
equal
at
least
with
what
I
find
at
court
.
<EOS>
however
,
there
be
my
home
,
and
thither
<EOS>
it
be
necessary
I
should
retreat
for
the
present

<EOS>
"
but
,
indeed
,
bad
as
I
apprehend
my
treatment
in
the
city
would
be
,
it
exceed
my
expectation
.
<EOS>
I
ride
home
on
an
amble
pad
through
crowd
who
express
every
kind
of
disregard
and
contempt
;
pelt
me
not
only
with
the
most
abusive
language
,
but
with
dirt
.
<EOS>
however
,
with
much
difficulty
I
arrive
at
last
at
my
own
house
,
with
my
bone
whole
,
but
cover
over
with
filth
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
I
be
get
within
my
door
,
and
have
shut
them
against
the
mob
,
who
have
pretty
well
vent
their
spleen
,
and
seem
now
content
to
retire
,
my
wife
,
whom
I
find
cry
over
her
child
,
and
from
whom
I
have
hope
some
comfort
in
my
affliction
,
fall
upon
me
in
the
most
outrageous
manner
.
<EOS>
She
ask
me
why
I
would
venture
on
such
a
step
,
without
consult
her
;
she
say
her
advice
may
have
be
civilly
ask
,
if
I
be
resolve
not
to
have
be
guide
by
it

<EOS>
that
,
whatever
opinion
I
may
have
conceive
of
her
understanding

the
rest
of
the
world
think
better
of
it

<EOS>
that
I
have
never
fail
when
I
have
ask
her
counsel
,
nor
ever
succeed
without
it
;
 
with
much
more
of
the
same
kind
,
too
tedious
to
mention
;
conclude
that
it
be
a
monstrous
behavior
to
desert
my
party
and
come
over
to
the
court
.
  
<EOS>
an
abuse
which
I
take
bad
than
all
the
rest
,
as
she
have
be
constantly
for
several
year
assiduous
in
rail
at
the
opposition
,
in
side
with
the
court
-
party
,
and
beg
me
to
come
over
to
it
;
and
especially
after
my
mention
the
offer
of
knighthood
to
her
,
since
which
time
she
have
continually
interrupt
my
repose
with
din
in
my
ear
the
folly
of
refuse
honor
and
of
adhere
to
a
party
and
to
principle
by
which
I
be
certain
of
procure
no
advantage
to
myself
and
my
family
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
now
entirely
lose
my
trade
,
so
that
I
have
not
the
least
temptation
to
stay
longer
in
a
city
where
I
be
certain
of
receive
daily
affront
and
rebuke
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
make
up
my
affair
with
the
utmost
expedition
,
and
,
scrape
together
all
I
could
,
retire
into
the
country
,
where
I
spend
the
remainder
of
my
day
in
universal
contempt

be
shun
by
everybody

perpetually

by
my

by

me

I
unhappily

indulge
to
my
cost

for
my
verse
draw
on

only
ridicule

and
I
be
in
contempt
call
the

<EOS>
"
this
humor
pursue
me
through
my
life
.
<EOS>
My
first
composition
after
I
leave
school
be
a
panegyric
on
pope
Alexander
IV
,
who
then
pretend
a
project
of
dethrone
the
king
of
Sicily
.
<EOS>
on
this
subject
I
compose
a
poem
of
about
fifteen
thousand
line
,
which
with
much
difficulty
I
get
to
be
present
to
his
holiness
,
of
whom
I
expect
great
preferment
as
my
reward
;
but
I
be
cruelly
disappoint
:
for
when
I
have
wait
a
year
,
without
hear
any
of
the
commendation
I
have
flatter
myself
with
receiving
,
and
be
now
able
to
contain
no
longer
,
I
apply
to
a
Jesuit
who
be
my
relation
,
and
have
the
pope
's
ear
,
to
know
what
his
holiness
's
opinion
be
of
my
work
:
he
coldly
answer
me
that
he
be
at
that
time
busy
in
concern
of
too
much
importance
to
attend
the
reading
of
poem
.
  
<EOS>
"
however
dissatisfied
I
may
be
,
and
really
be
,
with
this
reception
,
and
however
angry
I
be
with
the
pope
?
<EOS>
for
whose
understanding
I
entertain
an
immoderate
contempt
,
I
be
not
yet
discourage
from
a
second
attempt
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
I
soon
after
produce
another
work
,
entitle
,
the
Trojan
Horse
.
<EOS>
this
be
an
allegorical
work
,
in
which
the
church
be
introduce
into
the
world
in
the

manner
as
that
machine

<EOS>
I
believe
Julian
,
have
I
not
stop
him
,
would
have
go
through
the
whole
poem
(
for
,
as
I
observe
in
most
of
the
character
he
relate
,
the
affection
he
have
enjoy
while
he
personate
them
on
earth
still
make
some
impression
on
him
)
;
but
I
beg
him
to
omit
the
sequel
of
the
poem
,
and
proceed
with
his
history
.
<EOS>
He
then
recollect
himself
,
and
,
smile
at
the
observation
which
by
intuition
he
perceive
I
have
make
,
continue
his
narration
as
follow
:
    
<EOS>
"
I
confess
to
you
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
the
delight
in
repeat
our
own
work
be
so
predominant
in
a
poet
,
that
I
find
nothing
can
totally
root
it
out
of
the
soul
.
<EOS>
happy
would
it
be
for
those
person
if
their
hearer
could
be
delight
in
the
same
manner
:
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
hence
that
ingens
solitudo
complain
of
by
Horace
:
for
the
vanity
of
mankind
be
so
much
greedy
and
more
general
than
their
avarice
,
<EOS>
that
no
beggar
be
so
ill
receive
by
them
as
he
who
solicit
their
praise
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
I
sufficiently
experience
in
the
character
of
a
poet
;
for
my
company
be
shun
(
I
believe
on
this
account
chiefly
)
by
my
whole
house

<EOS>
nay
,
there
be
few
who
would
submit
to
hear
me
read
my
poetry

even
at
the
price
of
sharing
in
my
provision

<EOS>
the
only
person
who
give
me
audience
be
a
brother
poet

he
indeed
feed
me
with
commendation
very
liberally
:
but
,
as
I
be
force
to
hear
and
commend
in
my
turn
,
I
perhaps
buy
his
attention
dear
enough

"
well
,
sir

if
my
expectation
of
the
reward
I
hope
from
my
first
poem
have
balk
me

I
have
now
still
great
reason
to
complain
;
for
,
instead
of
be
prefer
or
commend
for
the
second

I
be
enjoin
a
very
severe
penance
by
my
superior
,
for
ludicrously
compare
the
pope
to
a
f####t

My
poetry
be
now
the
jest
of
every
company

except
some
few
who
speak
of
it
with
detestation
;
and
I
find
that
,
instead
of
recommend
me
to
preferment
,
it
have
effectually
bar
me
from
all
probability
of
attain
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
these
discouragement
have
now
induce
me
to
lay
down
my
pen
and
write
no
more

,
as
Juvenal

S

<EOS>
I
be
an
example

the
truth

assertion

I
soon
betook
myself
again

indeed

a

the

happiness

enjoy

only
undervalue
their
taste

not
correspond
with
his
own

"
It
be
unnecessary
to
mention
any
more
of
my
poem
;
they
have
all
the

fate
;
and
though
in
reality
some
of

latter
piece
deserve

I
may
now
speak
it

an
observation

one

bad
author

the
truth

both
stand
on
one

the
same
reason

viz
.
,
that
they
be
both
tainted

that
cursed
and
detestable
vice
of
envy

which
,
as
it

the
great
torment

introduce
into

corruption

of
inspire
it
to
the
commission

the
most
horrid
crime
imaginable

My
life

short

I

pine
myself
to
death

the
vice
I
just
now
mention

Minos

me
I

real
importance
,
than
now
.
<EOS>
I
look
on
dance
as
the
great
excellence
of
human
nature
,
and
on
myself
as
the
great
proficient
in
it
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
this
seem
to
be
the
general
opinion
of
the
whole
court
;
for
I
be
the
chief
instructor
of
the
youth
of
both
sex
,
whose
merit
be
almost
entirely
define
by
the
advance
they
make
in
that
science
which
I
have
the
honor
to
profess
.
<EOS>
as
to
myself
,
I
be
so
fully
persuade
of
this
truth
,
that
I
not
only
slight
and
despise
those
who
be
ignorant
of
dancing
,
but
I
think
the
high
character
I
could
give
any
man
be
that
he
make
a
graceful
bow
:
for
want
of
which
accomplishment
<EOS>
I
have
a
sovereign
contempt
for
most
person
of
learning
;
<EOS>
nay
,
for
some
officer
in
the
army
,
and
a
few
even
of
the
courtier
themselves
.
   
<EOS>
"
though
so
little
of
my
youth
have
be
throw
away
in
what
they
call
literature
that
I
could
hardly
write
and
read
,
yet
I
compose
a
treatise
on
education
;
the
first
rudiment
of
which
,
as
I
teach
,
be
to
instruct
a
child
in
the
science
of
come
handsomely
into
a
room
.
<EOS>
in
this
I
correct
many
fault
of
my
predecessor
,
particularly
that
of
be
too
much
in
a
hurry
,
and
institute
a
child
in
the
sublimer
part
of
dancing
before
they
be
capable
of
make
their
honor
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
as
I
have
not
now
the
same
high
opinion
of
my
profession
which
I
have
then
,
I
shall
not
entertain
you
with
a
long
history
of
a
life
which
consist
of
boree
and
coupee
.
<EOS>
let
it
suffice
that
I
live
to
a
very
old
age
and
follow
my
business
as
long
as
I
could
crawl
.
<EOS>
at
length
I
revisit
my
old
friend
Minos
,
who
treat
me
with
very
little
respect
and
bade
me
dance
back
again
to
earth
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
so
,
and
be
now
once
more
bear
an
Englishman
,
breed
up
to
the
church
,
and
at
length
arrive
to
the
station
of
a
bishop

here
part
of
the
manuscript

that
a
very
considerable
one
,

appear
by
the
number
of
the
next
book

chapter

which

I
find

the

as

the
manner

it

to
whom
the

we
be
totally

<EOS>
I
have
only
to
remark
,
that
this
chapter
be
,
in
the
original
,
writ
in
a
woman

hand

<EOS>
and
,
though
the
observation
in
it
be
,
I
think
,
as
excellent
as
any
in
the
whole
volume
,
there
seem
to
be
a
difference
in
style
between
this
and
the
precede
chapter
;
and
,
as
it
be
the
character
of
a
woman

relate
,
I
be
incline
to
fancy
<EOS>
it
be
really
write
by
one
of
that
sex

BOOK

VII
wherein
Anna
Boleyn
relate
the
history
of
her
life

<EOS>
"
I
be
go
now
truly
to
recount
a
life
which
from
the
time
of
its
ceasing
have
be
,
in
the
other
world
,
<EOS>
the
continual
subject
of
the
cavil
of
contend
party
<EOS>

the
one
make
me
as
black
as
hell
,
the
other
as
pure
and
innocent
as
the
inhabitant
of
this
bless
place
;
the
mist
of
prejudice
blind
their
eye
,
and
zeal
for
what
they
themselves
profess
,
make
everything
appear
in
that
light
<EOS>
which
they
think
most
conduce
to
its
honor

<EOS>
"
My
infancy
be
spend
in
my
father
's
house
,
in
those
childish
play
which
be
most
suitable
to
that
state
,
and
I
think
this
be
one
of
the
happy
part
of
my
life
;
for
my
parent
be
not
among
the
number
of
those
who
look
upon
their
child
as
so
many
object
of
a
tyrannic
power
,
but
I
be
regard
as
the
dear
pledge
of
a
virtuous
love
,
and
all
my
little
pleasure
be
think
from
their
indulgence
their
great
delight
.
<EOS>
at
seven
year
old
I
be
carry
into
France
with
the
king
's
sister
,
who
be
marry
to
the
french
king
,
where
I
live
with
a
person
of
quality
,
who
be
an
acquaintance
of
my
father
's
.
<EOS>
I
spend
my
time
in
learn
those
thing
necessary
to
give
young
person
of
fashion
a
polite
education
,
and
do
neither
good
nor
evil
,
but
day
pass
after
day
in
the
same
easy
way
till
I
be
fourteen
;
then
begin
my
anxiety
,
my
vanity
grow
strong
,
and
my
heart
flutter
with
joy
at
every
compliment
pay
to
my
beauty
:
and
as
the
lady
with
whom
I
live
be
of
a
gay
,
cheerful
disposition
,
she
keep
a
great
deal
of
company
,
and
my
youth
and
charm
make
me
the
continual
object
of
their
admiration
.
<EOS>
I
pass
some
little
time
in
those
exulting
rapture
which
be
feel
by
every
woman
perfectly
satisfied
with
herself
and
with
the
behavior
of
other
towards
her
:
<EOS>
I
be
,
when
very
young
,
promote
to
be
maid
of
honor
to
her
majesty
.
<EOS>
the
court
be
frequent
by
a
young
nobleman
whose
beauty
be
the
chief
subject
of
conversation
in
all
assembly
of
lady
.
<EOS>
the
delicacy
of
his
person
,
add
to
a
great
softness
in
his
manner
,
give
everything
he
say
and
do
such
an
air
of
tenderness
,
that
every
woman
he
speak
to
flatter
herself
with
be
the
object
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
I
be
one
of
those
who
be
vain
enough
of
my
own
charm
to
hope
to
make
a
conquest
of
him
whom
the
whole
court
sigh
for
.
<EOS>
I
now
think
every
other
object
below
my
notice
;
yet
the
only
pleasure
I
propose
to
myself
in
this
design
be
,
the
triumphing
over
that
heart
which
I
plainly
see
all
the
lady
of
the
high
quality
and
the
great
beauty
would
have
be
proud
of
possess
.
<EOS>
I
be
yet
too
young
to
be
very
artful
;
but
nature
,
without
any
assistance
,
soon
discover
to
a
man
who
be
use
to
gallantry
a
woman
's
desire
to
be
like
by
him
,
whether
that
desire
arise
from
any
particular
choice
she
make
of
him
,
or
only
from
vanity
.
<EOS>
He
soon
perceive
my
thought
,
and
gratify
my
utmost
wish
by
constantly
prefer
me
before
all
other
woman
,
and
exert
his
utmost
gallantry
and
address
to
engage
my
affection
.
<EOS>
this
sudden
happiness
,
which
I
then
think
the
great
I
could
have
have
,
appear
visible
in
all
my
action
<EOS>
;
I
grow
so
gay
and
so
full
of
vivacity
that
it
make
my
person
appear
still
to
a
well
advantage
,
all
my
acquaintance
pretend
to
be
fonder
of
me
than
ever
:
though
,
young
as
I
be
,
I
plainly
see
it
be
but
pretense
,
for
through
all
their
endeavor
to
the
contrary
envy
would
often
break
forth
in
sly
insinuation
and
malicious
sneer
,
which
give
me
fresh
matter
of
triumph
,
and
frequent
opportunity
of
insult
them
,
which
I
never
let
slip
,
for
now
first
my
female
heart
grow
sensible
of
the
spiteful
pleasure
of
see
another
languish
for
what
I
enjoy
.
<EOS>
whilst
I
be
in
the
height
of
my
happiness
<EOS>
her
majesty
fall
ill
of
a
languishing
distemper
,
which
oblige
her
to
go
into
the
country
for
the
change
of
air
:
<EOS>
my
place
make
it
necessary
for
me
to
attend
her
,
and
which
way
he
bring
it
about
<EOS>
I
can
not
imagine
,
but
my
young
hero
find
mean
to
be
one
of
that
small
train
that
wait
on
my
royal
mistress
,
although
she
go
as
privately
as
possible
.
<EOS>
hitherto
all
the
interview
I
have
ever
have
with
him
be
in
public
,
and
I
only
look
on
him
as
the
fitter
object
to
feed
that
pride
which
have
no
other
view
but
to
show
its
power
;
but
now
the
scene
be
quite
change
.
<EOS>
My
rival
,
be
all
at
a
distance
:
<EOS>
the
place
we
go
to
be
as
charming
as
the
most
agreeable
natural
situation
,
assist
by
the
great
art
,
could
make
it
;
the
pleasant
solitary
walk
the
singing
of
bird
,
the
thousand
pretty
romantic
scene
<EOS>
this
delightful
place
afford
,
give
a
sudden
turn
to
my
mind
;
my
whole
soul
be
melt
into
softness
,
and
all
my
vanity
be
flee
.
<EOS>
My
spark
be
too
much
use
to
affair
of
this
nature
not
to
perceive
this
change
;
at
first
the
profuse
transport
of
his
joy
make
me
believe
him
wholly
mine
,
and
this
belief
give
me
such
happiness
that
no
language
afford
word
to
express
it
,
and
can
be
only
know
to
those
who
have
feel
it
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
of
a
very
short
duration
,
for
I
soon
find
I
have
to
do
with
one
of
those
man
whose
only
end
in
the
pursuit
of
a
woman
be
to
make
her
fall
a
victim
to
an
insatiable
desire
to
be
admire
.
<EOS>
His
design
have
succeed
,
and
now
he
every
day
grow
cold
,
and
,
as
if
by
infatuation
,
my
passion
every
day
increase
;
and
,
notwithstanding
all
my
resolution
and
endeavor
to
the
contrary
,
my
rage
at
the
disappointment
at
once
both
of
my
love
and
pride
,
and
at
the
find
a
passion
fix
in
my
breast
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
to
conquer
,
break
out
into
that
inconsistent
behavior
which
must
always
be
the
consequence
of
violent
passion
.
<EOS>
one
moment
I
reproach
him
,
the
next
I
grow
to
tenderness
and
blame
myself
,
and
think
I
fancy
what
be
not
true
<EOS>
:
he
see
my
struggle
and
triumph
in
it
;
but
,
as
he
have
not
witness
enough
there
of
his
victory
to
give
him
the
full
enjoyment
of
it
,
he
grow
weary
of
the
country
and
return
to
Paris
,
and
leave
me
in
a
condition
it
be
utterly
impossible
to
describe
.
<EOS>
My
mind
be
like
a
city
up
in
arm
,
all
confusion
;
and
every
new
thought
be
a
fresh
disturber
of
my
peace
.
<EOS>
sleep
quite
forsook
me
,
and
the
anxiety
I
suffer
throw
me
into
a
fever
which
have
like
to
have
cost
me
my
life
.
<EOS>
with
great
care
I
recover
,
but
the
violence
of
the
distemper
leave
such
a
weakness
on
my
body
that
the
disturbance
of
my
mind
be
greatly
assuage
;
and
now
I
begin
to
comfort
myself
in
the
reflection
that
this
gentleman
's
be
a
finished
coquette
be
very
likely
<EOS>
the
only
thing
could
have
preserve
me
;
for
he
be
the
only
man
from
whom
I
be
ever
in
any
danger
.
<EOS>
by
that
time
I
be
get
tolerably
<EOS>
well
we
return
to
Paris
;
and
I
confess
I
both
wish
and
fear
to
see
this
cause
of
<EOS>
all
my
pain
:
however
,
I
hope
,
by
the
help
of
my
resentment
,
to
be
able
to
meet
him
with
indifference
.
<EOS>
this
employ
my
thought
till
our
arrival
.
<EOS>
the
next
day
there
be
a
very
full
court
to
congratulate
the
queen
on
her
recovery
;
and
amongst
the
rest
my
love
appear
dressed
and
adorn
as
if
he
design
some
new
conquest
.
<EOS>
instead
of
see
a
woman
he
despise
and
slight
,
he
approach
me
with
that
assure
air
which
be
common
to
successful
coxcomb
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
I
perceive
I
be
surround
by
all
those
lady
who
be
on
his
account
my
great
enemy
,
and
,
in
revenge
,
wish
for
nothing
more
than
to
see
me
make
a
ridiculous
figure
.
<EOS>
this
situation
so
perplex
my
thought
,
that
when
he
come
near
enough
to
speak
to
me
,
I
faint
away
in
his
arm
.
<EOS>
have
I
study
which
way
I
could
gratify
him
most
,
it
be
impossible
to
have
do
anything
to
have
please
him
more
.
<EOS>
some
that
stand
by
bring
smelling
-
bottle
,
and
use
mean
for
my
recovery
;
and
I
be
welcome
to
return
life
by
all
those
repartee
which
woman
enrage
by
envy
<EOS>
be
capable
of
vent
.
<EOS>
one
cry
"
<EOS>
well
,
I
never
think
my
lord
have
anything
so
frightful
in
his
person
or
so
fierce
in
his
manner
as
to
strike
a
young
lady
dead
at
the
sight
of
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
another
,
"
some
lady
"
sense
be
more
apt
to
be
hurry
by
agreeable
than
disagreeable
object
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
with
many
more
such
sort
of
speech
which
show
more
malice
than
wit
.
<EOS>
this
not
be
able
to
bear
,
tremble
,
and
with
but
just
strength
enough
to
move
,
I
crawl
to
my
coach
and
hurried
home
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
alone
,
and
think
on
what
have
happen
to
me
in
a
public
court
,
I
be
at
first
drive
to
the
utmost
despair
;
but
afterwards
,
when
I
come
to
reflect
,
I
believe
this
accident
contribute
more
to
my
be
cure
of
my
passion
than
any
other
could
have
do
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
the
only
method
to
pique
the
man
who
have
use
me
so
barbarously
,
and
to
be
revenge
on
my
spiteful
rival
,
be
to
recover
that
beauty
which
be
then
languid
and
have
lose
its
luster
,
to
let
them
see
I
have
still
charm
enough
to
engage
as
many
lover
as
I
could
desire
,
and
that
I
could
yet
rival
them
who
have
thus
cruelly
insult
me
.
<EOS>
these
pleasing
hope
revive
my
sinking
spirit
.
<EOS>
and
work
a
more
effectual
cure
on
me
than
all
the
philosophy
and
advice
of
the
wise
man
could
have
do
.
<EOS>
I
now
employ
all
my
time
and
care
in
adorn
my
person
,
and
study
the
sure
mean
of
engage
the
affection
of
other
,
while
I
myself
continue
quite
indifferent
;
for
I
resolve
for
the
future
,
if
ever
one
soft
thought
make
its
way
to
my
heart
,
to
fly
the
object
of
it
,
and
by
new
lover
to
drive
the
image
from
my
breast
.
<EOS>
I
consult
my
glass
every
morning
,
and
get
such
a
command
of
my
countenance
that
I
could
suit
it
to
the
different
taste
of
variety
of
lover
;
and
though
I
be
young
,
for
I
be
not
yet
above
seventeen
,
yet
my
public
way
of
life
give
me
such
continual
opportunity
of
converse
with
man
,
and
the
strong
desire
I
now
have
of
please
them
lead
me
to
make
such
constant
observation
on
everything
they
say
or
do
,
that
I
soon
find
out
the
different
method
of
deal
with
them
.
<EOS>
I
observe
that
most
man
generally
like
in
woman
what
be
most
opposite
to
their
own
character
;
therefore
to
the
grave
solid
man
of
sense
I
endeavor
to
appear
sprightly
and
full
of
spirit
;
to
the
witty
and
gay
,
soft
and
languishing
;
to
the
amorous
(
for
they
want
no
increase
of
their
passion
)
,
cold
and
reserved
;
to
the
fearful
and
backward
,
warm
and
full
of
fire
;
and
so
of
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
as
to
beaux
,
and
all
of
those
sort
of
man
,
whose
desire
be
center
in
the
satisfaction
of
their
vanity
,
I
have
learn
by
sad
experience
the
only
way
to
deal
with
them
be
to
laugh
at
them
and
let
their
own
good
opinion
of
themselves
be
the
only
support
of
their
hope
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
while
I
could
get
other
follower
,
I
be
sure
of
them
;
for
the
only
sign
of
modesty
they
ever
give
be
that
of
not
depend
on
their
own
judgment
,
but
follow
the
opinion
of
the
great
number
.
<EOS>
thus
furnish
with
maxim
,
and
grow
wise
by
past
error
,
I
in
a
manner
begin
the
world
again
:
I
appear
in
all
public
place
handsomer
and
more
lively
than
ever
,
to
the
amazement
of
every
one
who
see
me
and
have
hear
of
the
affair
between
me
and
my
lord
.
<EOS>
He
himself
be
much
surprised
and
vexed
at
this
sudden
change
,
nor
could
he
account
how
it
be
possible
for
me
so
soon
to
shake
off
those
chain
he
think
he
have
fix
on
me
for
life
;
nor
be
he
willing
to
lose
his
conquest
in
this
manner
.
<EOS>
He
endeavor
by
all
mean
possible
to
talk
to
me
again
of
love
,
but
I
stand
fix
to
my
resolution
(
in
which
I
be
greatly
assist
by
the
crowd
of
admirer
that
daily
surround
me
)
never
to
let
him
explain
himself
:
for
,
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
my
pride
,
I
find
the
first
impression
the
heart
receive
of
love
be
so
strong
that
it
require
the
most
vigilant
care
to
prevent
a
relapse
.
<EOS>
now
I
live
three
year
in
a
constant
round
of
diversion
,
and
be
make
the
perfect
idol
of
all
the
man
that
come
to
court
of
all
age
and
all
character
.
<EOS>
I
have
several
good
match
offer
me
,
but
I
think
none
of
them
equal
to
my
merit
;
and
one
of
my
great
pleasure
be
to
see
those
woman
who
have
pretend
to
rival
me
often
glad
to
marry
those
whom
I
have
refuse
.
<EOS>
yet
,
notwithstanding
this
great
success
of
my
scheme
,
I
can
not
say
I
be
perfectly
happy
;
for
every
woman
that
be
take
the
least
notice
of
,
and
every
man
that
be
insensible
to
my
art
,
give
me
as
much
pain
as
all
the
rest
give
me
pleasure
;
and
sometimes
little
underhand
plot
which
be
lay
against
my
design
would
succeed
in
spite
of
my
care
:
so
that
I
really
begin
to
grow
weary
of
this
manner
of
life
,
when
my
father
,
return
from
his
embassy
in
France
,
take
me
home
with
him
,
and
carry
me
to
a
little
pleasant
country
-
house
,
where
there
be
nothing
grand
or
superfluous
,
but
everything
neat
and
agreeable
.
<EOS>
there
I
lead
a
life
perfectly
solitary
.
<EOS>
at
first
the
time
hang
very
heavy
on
my
hand
,
and
I
want
all
kind
of
employment
,
and
<EOS>
I
have
very
like
to
have
fall
into
the
height
of
the
vapor
,
from
no
other
reason
but
from
want
of
know
what
to
do
with
myself
.
<EOS>
but
when
I
have
live
here
a
little
time
I
find
such
a
calmness
in
my
mind
,
and
such
a
difference
between
this
and
the
restless
anxiety
I
have
experience
in
a
court
,
that
I
begin
to
share
the
tranquillity
that
visibly
appear
in
everything
round
me
.
<EOS>
I
set
myself
to
do
work
of
fancy
,
and
to
raise
little
flower
-
garden
,
with
many
such
innocent
rural
amusement
;
which
,
although
they
be
not
capable
of
afford
any
great
pleasure
,
yet
they
give
that
serene
turn
to
the
mind
which
I
think
much
preferable
to
anything
else
human
nature
be
make
susceptible
of
.
<EOS>
I
now
resolve
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
day
here
,
and
that
nothing
should
allure
me
from
that
sweet
retirement
,
to
be
again
toss
about
with
tempestuous
passion
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
whilst
<EOS>
I
be
in
this
situation
,
my
lord
Percy
,
the
earl
of
Northumberland
's
eld
son
,
by
an
accident
of
lose
his
way
after
a
fox
-
chase
,
be
meet
by
my
father
,
about
a
mile
from
our
house
;
he
come
home
with
him
,
only
with
a
design
of
dining
with
us
,
but
be
so
take
with
me
that
he
stay
three
day
.
<EOS>
I
have
too
much
experience
in
all
affair
of
this
kind
not
to
see
presently
the
influence
I
have
on
him
;
but
I
be
at
that
time
so
entirely
free
from
all
ambition
,
that
even
the
prospect
of
be
a
countess
have
no
effect
on
me
;
and
I
then
think
nothing
in
the
world
could
have
bribe
me
to
have
change
my
way
of
life
.
<EOS>
this
young
lord
,
who
be
just
in
his
bloom
,
find
his
passion
so
strong
,
he
could
not
endure
a
long
absence
,
but
return
again
in
a
week
,
and
endeavor
,
by
all
the
mean
he
could
think
of
,
to
engage
me
to
return
his
affection
.
<EOS>
He
address
me
with
that
tenderness
and
respect
which
woman
on
earth
think
can
flow
from
nothing
but
real
love
;
and
very
often
tell
me
that
,
unless
he
could
be
so
happy
as
by
his
assiduity
and
care
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
me
,
although
he
know
my
father
would
eagerly
embrace
any
proposal
from
him
,
yet
he
would
suffer
that
last
of
misery
of
never
see
me
more
rather
than
owe
his
own
happiness
to
anything
that
may
be
the
least
contradiction
to
my
inclination
.
<EOS>
this
manner
of
proceeding
have
something
in
it
so
noble
and
generous
,
that
by
degree
it
raise
a
sensation
in
me
which
I
know
not
how
to
describe
,
nor
by
what
name
to
call
it
:
it
be
nothing
like
my
former
passion
:
for
there
be
no
turbulence
,
<EOS>
no
uneasy
wake
night
attend
it
,
but
all
I
could
<EOS>
with
honor
grant
to
oblige
him
appear
to
me
to
be
justly
due
to
his
truth
and
love
,
and
more
the
effect
of
gratitude
than
of
any
desire
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
the
character
I
have
hear
of
him
from
my
father
at
my
first
return
to
England
,
in
discoursing
of
the
young
nobility
,
convince
me
that
if
I
be
his
wife
I
should
have
the
perpetual
satisfaction
of
know
every
action
of
his
must
be
approve
by
all
the
sensible
part
of
mankind
;
so
that
very
soon
I
begin
to
have
no
scruple
leave
but
<EOS>
that
of
leave
my
little
scene
of
quietness
,
and
venture
again
into
the
world
.
<EOS>
but
this
,
by
his
continual
application
and
submissive
behavior
,
by
degree
entirely
vanish
,
and
I
agree
he
should
take
his
own
time
to
break
it
to
my
father
,
whose
consent
he
be
not
long
in
obtain
;
for
such
a
match
be
by
no
means
to
be
refuse
.
<EOS>
there
remain
nothing
now
to
be
do
but
to
prevail
with
the
earl
of
Northumberland
to
comply
with
what
his
son
so
ardently
desire
;
for
which
purpose
he
set
out
immediately
for
London
,
and
beg
it
as
the
great
favor
that
I
would
accompany
my
father
,
who
be
also
to
go
thither
the
week
follow
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
refuse
his
request
,
and
as
soon
as
we
arrive
in
town
he
fly
to
me
with
the
great
rapture
to
inform
me
<EOS>
his
father
be
so
good
that
,
find
his
happiness
depend
on
his
answer
,
he
have
give
him
free
leave
to
act
in
this
affair
as
would
best
please
himself
,
and
that
he
have
now
no
obstacle
to
prevent
his
wish
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
the
beginning
of
the
winter
,
and
the
time
for
our
marriage
be
fix
for
the
latter
end
of
March
:
the
consent
of
all
party
make
his
access
to
me
very
easy
,
and
we
converse
together
both
with
innocence
and
pleasure
.
<EOS>
as
his
fondness
be
so
great
that
he
contrive
all
the
method
possible
to
keep
me
continually
in
his
sight
,
he
tell
me
one
morning
he
be
command
by
his
father
to
attend
him
to
court
that
evening
,
and
beg
I
would
be
so
good
as
to
meet
him
there
.
<EOS>
I
be
now
so
used
to
act
as
he
would
have
me
that
I
make
no
difficulty
of
comply
with
his
desire
.
<EOS>
two
day
after
this
,
I
be
very
much
surprised
at
perceive
such
a
melancholy
in
his
countenance
,
and
alteration
in
his
behavior
,
as
I
could
no
way
account
for
;
but
,
by
importunity
,
at
last
I
get
from
him
that
cardinal
Wolsey
,
for
what
reason
he
know
not
,
have
peremptorily
forbid
him
to
think
any
more
of
me
:
<EOS>
and
,
when
he
urge
that
his
father
be
not
displeased
with
it
,
the
cardinal
,
in
his
imperious
manner
,
answer
him
,
he
should
give
his
father
such
convincing
reason
why
it
would
be
attend
with
great
inconvenience
,
that
he
be
sure
he
could
bring
him
to
be
of
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
on
which
he
turn
from
him
,
and
give
him
no
opportunity
of
reply
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
imagine
what
design
the
cardinal
could
have
in
intermeddle
in
this
match
,
and
I
be
still
more
perplexed
to
find
that
my
father
treat
my
lord
Percy
with
much
more
coldness
than
usual
;
he
too
see
it
,
and
we
both
wonder
what
could
possibly
be
the
cause
of
all
this
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
long
before
the
mystery
be
all
make
clear
by
my
father
,
who
,
send
for
me
one
day
into
his
chamber
,
let
me
into
a
secret
which
be
as
little
wished
for
as
expect
.
<EOS>
He
begin
with
the
surprising
effect
of
youth
and
beauty
,
and
the
madness
of
let
go
those
advantage
they
may
procure
us
till
it
be
too
late
,
when
we
may
wish
in
vain
to
bring
them
back
again
.
<EOS>
I
stand
amazed
at
this
beginning
;
he
see
my
confusion
,
and
bid
me
sit
down
and
attend
to
what
he
be
go
to
tell
me
,
which
be
of
the
great
consequence
;
and
he
hope
I
would
be
wise
enough
to
take
his
advice
,
and
act
as
he
should
think
best
for
my
future
welfare
.
<EOS>
He
then
ask
me
if
I
should
not
be
much
pleased
to
be
a
queen
?
<EOS>
I
answer
,
with
the
great
earnestness
,
that
,
so
far
from
it
,
I
would
not
live
in
a
court
again
to
be
the
great
queen
in
the
world
;
that
I
have
a
lover
who
be
both
desirous
and
able
to
raise
my
station
even
beyond
my
wish
.
<EOS>
I
find
this
discourse
be
very
displeasing
;
my
father
frown
,
and
call
me
a
romantic
fool
,
and
say
if
I
would
hearken
to
him
he
could
make
me
a
queen
;
for
the
cardinal
have
tell
him
that
the
king
,
from
the
time
he
see
me
at
court
the
other
night
,
like
me
,
and
intend
to
get
a
divorce
from
his
wife
,
and
to
put
me
in
her
place
;
and
order
him
to
find
some
method
to
make
me
a
maid
of
honor
to
her
present
majesty
,
that
in
the
meantime
he
may
have
an
opportunity
of
see
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
express
the
astonishment
these
word
throw
me
into
;
and
,
notwithstanding
that
the
moment
before
,
when
it
appear
at
so
great
a
distance
,
I
be
very
sincere
in
my
declaration
how
much
it
be
against
my
will
to
be
raise
so
high
,
yet
now
the
prospect
come
near
,
I
confess
my
heart
flutter
,
and
my
eye
be
dazzle
with
a
view
of
be
seat
on
a
throne
.
  
<EOS>
My
imagination
present
before
me
all
the
pomp
,
power
and
greatness
that
attend
a
crown
;
and
I
be
so
perplexed
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
answer
,
but
remain
as
silent
as
if
I
have
lose
the
use
of
my
speech
.
<EOS>
My
father
,
who
guess
what
it
be
that
make
me
in
this
condition
,
proceed
to
bring
all
the
argument
he
think
most
likely
to
bend
me
to
his
will
;
at
last
I
recover
from
this
dream
of
grandeur
,
and
beg
him
,
by
all
the
most
endearing
name
I
could
think
of
,
not
to
urge
me
dishonorably
to
forsake
the
man
who
I
be
convince
would
raise
me
to
an
empire
if
in
his
power
,
and
who
have
enough
in
his
power
to
give
me
all
I
desire
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
deaf
to
all
I
could
say
,
and
insist
that
by
next
week
I
should
prepare
myself
to
go
to
court
<EOS>
:
he
bid
me
consider
of
it
,
and
not
prefer
a
ridiculous
notion
of
honor
to
the
real
interest
of
my
whole
family
;
but
,
above
all
thing
,
not
to
disclose
what
he
have
trust
me
with
.
<EOS>
on
which
he
leave
me
to
my
own
thought
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
alone
<EOS>
I
reflect
how
little
real
tenderness
this
behavior
show
to
me
,
whose
happiness
he
do
not
at
all
consult
,
but
only
look
on
me
as
a
ladder
,
on
which
he
could
climb
to
the
height
of
his
own
ambitious
desire
:
<EOS>
and
when
I
think
on
his
fondness
for
me
in
my
infancy
I
could
impute
it
to
nothing
but
either
the
like
me
as
a
plaything
or
the
gratification
of
his
vanity
in
my
beauty
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
too
much
divide
between
a
crown
and
my
engagement
to
lord
Percy
to
spend
much
time
in
thinking
of
anything
else
;
and
,
although
my
father
have
positively
forbid
me
,
yet
,
when
he
come
next
,
I
could
not
help
acquaint
him
with
all
that
have
pass
,
with
the
reserve
only
of
the
struggle
in
my
own
mind
on
the
first
mention
of
be
a
queen
.
<EOS>
I
expect
he
would
have
receive
the
news
with
the
great
agony
;
but
he
show
no
vast
emotion
:
however
,
he
could
not
help
turn
pale
,
and
,
take
me
by
the
hand
,
look
at
me
with
an
air
of
tenderness
,
and
say
,
"
if
be
a
queen
would
make
you
happy
,
and
it
be
in
your
power
to
be
so
<EOS>
,
I
would
not
for
the
world
prevent
it
,
let
me
suffer
what
I
will
.
"
<EOS>
this
amazing
greatness
of
mind
have
on
me
quite
the
contrary
effect
from
what
it
ought
to
have
have
;
for
,
instead
of
increase
my
love
for
him
it
almost
put
an
end
to
it
,
and
I
begin
to
think
,
if
he
could
part
with
me
,
the
matter
be
not
much
.
<EOS>
and
I
be
convinced
,
when
any
man
give
up
the
possession
of
a
woman
whose
consent
he
have
once
obtain
,
let
his
motive
be
ever
so
generous
,
he
will
disoblige
her
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
show
my
dissatisfaction
,
and
tell
him
I
be
very
glad
this
affair
sit
so
easily
on
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
power
to
answer
,
but
be
so
suddenly
strike
with
this
unexpected
ill
-
natured
turn
I
give
his
behavior
,
that
he
stand
amazed
for
some
time
,
and
then
bow
and
leave
me
.
<EOS>
now
I
be
again
leave
to
my
own
reflection
;
but
to
make
anything
intelligible
out
of
them
be
quite
impossible
:
I
wish
to
be
a
queen
,
and
wish
I
may
not
be
one
:
I
would
have
my
lord
Percy
happy
without
me
;
and
yet
I
would
not
have
the
power
of
my
charm
be
so
weak
that
he
could
bear
the
thought
of
life
after
be
disappoint
in
my
love
.
<EOS>
but
the
result
of
all
these
confuse
thought
be
a
resolution
to
obey
my
father
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
there
be
not
much
duty
in
the
case
,
though
at
that
time
I
be
glad
to
take
hold
of
that
small
shadow
to
save
me
from
look
on
my
own
action
in
the
true
light
.
<EOS>
when
my
lover
come
again
I
look
on
him
with
that
coldness
that
he
could
not
bear
,
on
purpose
to
rid
myself
of
all
importunity
:
for
since
I
have
resolve
to
use
him
ill
<EOS>
I
regard
him
as
the
monument
of
my
shame
,
and
his
every
look
appear
to
me
to
upbraid
me
.
<EOS>
My
father
soon
carry
me
to
court
;
there
I
have
no
very
hard
part
to
act
;
for
,
with
the
experience
I
have
have
of
mankind
,
I
could
find
no
great
difficulty
in
manage
a
man
who
like
me
,
and
for
whom
I
not
only
do
not
care
but
have
an
utter
aversion
to
:
but
this
aversion
he
believe
to
be
virtue
;
for
how
credulous
be
a
man
who
have
an
inclination
to
believe
!
<EOS>
and
I
take
care
sometimes
to
drop
word
of
cottage
and
love
,
and
how
happy
the
woman
be
who
fix
her
affection
on
a
man
in
such
a
station
of
life
that
she
may
show
her
love
without
be
suspect
of
hypocrisy
or
mercenary
view
.
<EOS>
all
this
be
swallow
very
easily
by
the
amorous
king
,
who
push
on
the
divorce
with
the
utmost
impetuosity
,
although
the
affair
last
a
good
while
,
and
I
remain
most
part
of
the
time
behind
the
curtain
.
<EOS>
whenever
the
king
mention
it
to
me
<EOS>
I
use
such
argument
against
it
as
I
think
the
most
likely
to
make
him
the
more
eager
for
it
;
beg
that
,
unless
his
conscience
be
really
touch
,
he
would
not
on
my
account
give
any
grief
to
his
virtuous
queen
;
for
in
be
her
handmaid
<EOS>
I
think
myself
highly
honor
;
and
that
I
would
not
only
forego
a
crown
,
but
even
give
up
the
pleasure
of
ever
see
him
more
,
rather
than
wrong
my
royal
mistress
.
<EOS>
this
way
of
talking
,
join
to
his
eager
desire
to
possess
my
person
,
convince
the
king
so
strongly
of
my
exalted
merit
,
that
he
think
it
a
meritorious
act
to
displace
the
woman
(
whom
he
could
not
have
so
good
an
opinion
of
,
because
he
be
tired
of
her
)
,
and
to
put
me
in
her
place
.
<EOS>
after
about
a
year
's
stay
at
court
,
as
the
king
's
love
to
me
begin
to
be
talk
of
,
it
be
think
proper
to
remove
me
,
that
there
may
be
no
umbrage
give
to
the
queen
's
party
.
<EOS>
I
be
force
to
comply
with
this
,
though
greatly
against
my
will
;
for
I
be
very
jealous
that
absence
may
change
the
king
's
mind
.
<EOS>
I
retire
again
with
my
father
to
his
country
-
seat
,
but
it
have
no
longer
those
charm
for
me
which
I
once
enjoy
there
;
for
my
mind
be
now
too
much
take
up
with
ambition
to
make
room
for
any
other
thought
.
<EOS>
during
my
stay
here
,
my
royal
lover
often
send
gentleman
to
me
with
message
and
letter
,
which
I
always
answer
in
the
manner
I
think
would
best
bring
about
my
design
,
which
be
to
come
back
again
to
court
.
<EOS>
in
all
the
letter
that
pass
between
us
there
be
something
so
kingly
and
command
in
his
,
and
so
deceitful
and
submissive
in
mine
,
that
I
sometimes
could
not
help
reflect
on
the
difference
betwixt
this
correspondence
and
<EOS>
that
with
lord
Percy
;
yet
I
be
so
press
forward
by
the
desire
of
a
crown
,
I
could
not
think
of
turn
back
.
<EOS>
in
all
I
write
I
continually
praise
his
resolution
of
let
me
be
at
a
distance
from
him
,
since
at
this
time
it
conduce
indeed
to
my
honor
;
but
,
what
be
of
ten
time
more
weight
with
me
,
I
think
it
be
necessary
for
his
;
and
I
would
sooner
suffer
anything
in
the
world
than
be
any
mean
of
hurt
to
him
,
either
in
his
interest
or
reputation
.
<EOS>
I
always
give
some
hint
of
ill
health
,
with
some
reflection
how
necessary
the
peace
of
the
mind
be
to
that
of
the
body
.
<EOS>
by
these
mean
I
bring
him
to
recall
me
again
by
the
most
absolute
command
,
which
I
,
for
a
little
time
,
artfully
delay
(
for
I
know
the
impatience
of
his
temper
would
not
bear
any
contradiction
)
,
till
he
make
my
father
in
a
manner
force
me
to
what
I
most
wish
,
with
the
utmost
appearance
of
reluctance
on
my
side
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
gain
this
point
I
begin
to
think
which
way
I
could
separate
the
king
from
the
queen
,
for
hitherto
they
live
in
the
same
house
.
<EOS>
the
lady
Mary
,
the
queen
's
daughter
,
be
then
about
sixteen
<EOS>
,
I
seek
for
emissary
of
her
own
age
that
I
could
confide
in
,
to
instill
into
her
mind
disrespectful
thought
of
her
father
,
and
make
a
jest
of
the
tenderness
of
his
conscience
about
the
divorce
.
<EOS>
I
know
she
have
naturally
strong
passion
,
and
that
young
people
of
that
age
be
apt
to
think
those
that
pretend
to
be
their
friend
be
really
so
,
and
only
speak
their
mind
freely
.
<EOS>
I
afterwards
contrive
to
have
every
word
she
speak
of
him
carry
to
the
king
,
who
take
it
all
as
I
could
wish
,
and
fancy
those
thing
do
not
come
at
first
from
the
young
lady
,
but
from
her
mother
.
<EOS>
He
would
often
talk
of
it
to
me
,
and
I
agree
with
him
in
his
sentiment
;
but
then
,
as
a
great
proof
of
my
goodness
,
I
always
endeavor
to
excuse
her
,
by
say
a
lady
so
long
time
use
to
be
a
royal
queen
may
naturally
be
a
little
exasperate
with
those
she
fancy
would
throw
her
from
that
station
she
so
justly
deserve
.
<EOS>
by
these
sort
of
plot
I
find
the
way
to
make
the
king
angry
with
the
queen
;
for
nothing
be
easy
than
to
make
a
man
angry
with
a
woman
he
want
to
be
rid
of
,
and
who
stand
in
the
way
between
him
and
his
pleasure
;
so
that
now
the
king
,
on
the
pretense
of
the
queen
's
obstinacy
in
a
point
where
his
conscience
be
so
tenderly
concern
,
part
with
her
.
<EOS>
everything
be
now
plain
before
me
;
I
have
nothing
farther
to
do
but
to
let
the
king
alone
to
his
own
desire
;
and
I
have
no
reason
to
fear
,
since
they
have
carry
him
so
far
,
but
that
they
would
urge
him
on
to
do
everything
I
aim
at
.
<EOS>
I
be
create
marchioness
of
Pembroke
.
<EOS>
this
dignity
sit
very
easy
on
me
;
for
the
thought
of
a
much
high
title
take
from
me
all
feeling
of
this
;
and
I
look
upon
be
a
marchioness
as
a
trifle
,
not
that
I
see
the
bauble
in
its
true
light
,
but
because
it
fall
short
of
what
I
have
figure
to
myself
<EOS>
I
should
soon
obtain
.
<EOS>
the
king
's
desire
grow
very
impatient
,
and
it
be
not
long
before
I
be
privately
married
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
no
sooner
his
wife
than
I
find
all
the
queen
come
upon
me
;
I
feel
myself
conscious
of
royalty
,
and
even
the
face
of
my
most
intimate
acquaintance
seem
to
me
to
be
quite
strange
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
them
:
height
have
turn
my
head
,
and
I
be
like
a
man
place
on
a
monument
,
to
whose
sight
all
creature
at
a
great
distance
below
him
appear
like
so
many
little
pigmy
crawl
about
on
the
earth
;
and
the
prospect
so
greatly
delight
me
,
that
I
do
not
presently
consider
that
in
both
case
descend
a
few
step
erect
by
human
hand
would
place
us
in
the
number
of
those
very
pigmy
who
appear
so
despicable
.
<EOS>
Our
marriage
be
keep
private
for
some
time
,
for
it
be
not
think
proper
to
make
it
public
(
the
affair
of
the
divorce
not
be
finish
)
till
the
birth
of
my
daughter
Elizabeth
make
it
necessary
.
<EOS>
but
all
who
see
me
know
it
;
for
my
manner
of
speak
and
acting
be
so
much
change
with
my
station
,
that
all
around
me
plainly
perceive
I
be
sure
I
be
a
queen
.
<EOS>
while
it
be
a
secret
I
have
yet
something
to
wish
for
;
I
could
not
be
perfectly
satisfied
till
all
the
world
be
acquaint
with
my
fortune
:
but
when
my
coronation
be
over
,
and
I
be
raise
to
the
height
of
my
ambition
,
instead
of
find
myself
happy
,
I
be
in
reality
more
miserable
than
ever
;
for
,
besides
that
the
aversion
I
have
naturally
to
the
king
be
much
more
difficult
to
dissemble
after
marriage
than
before
,
and
grow
into
a
perfect
detestation
,
my
imagination
,
which
have
thus
warmly
pursue
a
crown
,
grow
cool
when
I
be
in
the
possession
of
it
,
and
give
me
time
to
reflect
what
mighty
matter
I
have
gain
by
all
this
bustle
;
and
I
often
use
to
think
myself
in
the
case
of
the
fox
-
hunter
,
who
,
when
he
have
toil
and
sweat
all
day
in
the
chase
as
if
some
unheard
-
of
blessing
be
to
crown
his
success
,
find
at
last
all
he
have
get
by
his
labor
<EOS>
be
a
stink
nauseous
animal
.
<EOS>
but
my
condition
be
yet
bad
than
his
;
for
he
leave
the
loathsome
wretch
to
be
tear
by
his
hound
,
whilst
I
be
oblige
to
fondle
mine
,
and
meanly
pretend
him
to
be
the
object
of
my
love
.
<EOS>
for
the
whole
time
I
be
in
this
envy
,
this
exalted
state
,
I
lead
a
continual
life
of
hypocrisy
,
which
I
now
know
nothing
on
earth
can
compensate
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
companion
but
the
man
I
hate
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
disclose
my
sentiment
to
any
person
about
me
,
nor
do
any
one
presume
to
enter
into
any
freedom
of
conversation
with
me
;
but
all
who
speak
to
me
talk
to
the
queen
,
and
not
to
me
;
for
they
would
have
say
just
the
same
thing
to
a
dress
-
up
puppet
,
if
the
king
have
take
a
fancy
to
call
it
his
wife
.
<EOS>
and
as
I
know
every
woman
in
the
court
be
my
enemy
,
from
think
she
have
much
more
right
than
I
have
to
the
place
I
fill
,
I
think
myself
as
unhappy
as
if
I
have
be
place
in
a
wild
wood
,
where
there
be
no
human
creature
for
me
to
speak
to
,
in
a
continual
fear
of
leave
any
trace
of
my
footstep
,
lest
I
should
be
find
by
some
dreadful
monster
,
or
sting
by
snake
and
adder
;
for
such
be
spiteful
woman
to
the
object
of
their
envy
.
<EOS>
in
this
bad
of
all
situation
I
be
oblige
to
hide
my
melancholy
and
appear
cheerful
.
<EOS>
this
throw
me
into
an
error
the
other
way
,
and
I
sometimes
fall
into
a
levity
in
my
behavior
that
be
afterwards
make
use
of
to
my
disadvantage
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
son
deadborn
,
which
I
perceive
abate
something
of
the
king
's
ardor
;
for
his
temper
could
not
brook
the
least
disappointment
.
<EOS>
this
give
me
no
uneasiness
;
for
,
not
consider
the
consequence
,
I
could
not
help
be
best
pleased
when
I
have
least
of
his
company
.
<EOS>
afterwards
I
find
he
have
cast
his
eye
on
one
of
my
maid
of
honor
;
and
,
whether
it
be
owe
to
any
art
of
her
,
or
only
to
the
king
's
violent
passion
,
I
be
in
the
end
use
even
bad
than
my
former
mistress
have
be
by
my
mean
.
<EOS>
the
decay
of
the
king
's
affection
be
presently
see
by
all
those
court
-
sycophant
who
continually
watch
the
motion
of
royal
eye
;
and
the
moment
they
find
they
could
be
hear
against
me
they
turn
my
most
innocent
action
and
word
,
nay
,
even
my
very
look
,
into
proof
of
the
black
crime
.
<EOS>
the
king
,
who
be
impatient
to
enjoy
his
new
love
,
lend
a
willing
ear
to
all
my
accuser
,
who
find
way
of
make
him
jealous
that
I
be
false
to
his
bed
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
so
easily
have
believe
anything
against
me
before
,
but
he
be
now
glad
to
flatter
himself
that
he
have
find
a
reason
to
do
just
what
he
have
resolve
upon
without
a
reason
;
and
on
some
slight
pretense
and
hearsay
evidence
I
be
send
to
the
Tower
,
where
the
lady
who
be
my
great
enemy
be
appoint
to
watch
me
and
lie
in
the
same
chamber
with
me
.
<EOS>
this
be
really
as
bad
a
punishment
as
my
death
,
for
she
insult
me
with
those
keen
reproach
and
spiteful
witticism
,
which
throw
me
into
such
vapor
and
violent
fit
that
I
know
not
what
I
utter
in
this
condition
.
<EOS>
She
pretend
I
have
confess
talk
ridiculous
stuff
with
a
set
of
low
fellow
whom
I
have
hardly
ever
take
notice
of
,
as
could
have
impose
on
none
but
such
as
be
resolve
to
believe
.
<EOS>
I
be
bring
to
my
trial
,
and
,
to
blacken
me
the
more
,
accuse
of
converse
criminally
with
my
own
brother
,
whom
indeed
I
love
extremely
well
,
but
never
look
on
him
in
any
other
light
than
as
my
friend
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
be
condemn
to
be
behead
,
or
burn
,
as
the
king
please
;
and
he
be
graciously
pleased
,
from
the
great
remain
of
his
love
,
to
choose
the
mild
sentence
.
<EOS>
I
be
much
less
shocked
at
this
manner
of
end
my
life
than
I
should
have
be
in
any
other
station
:
<EOS>
but
I
have
have
so
little
enjoyment
from
the
time
I
have
be
a
queen
,
that
death
be
the
less
dreadful
to
me
.
<EOS>
the
chief
thing
that
lie
on
my
conscience
be
the
art
I
make
use
of
to
induce
the
king
to
part
with
the
queen
,
my
ill
usage
of
lady
Mary
,
and
my
jilting
lord
Percy
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
endeavor
to
calm
my
mind
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
hope
these
crime
would
be
forgive
me
;
for
in
other
respect
I
have
lead
a
very
innocent
life
,
and
always
do
all
the
good
-
natured
action
I
find
any
opportunity
of
do
.
<EOS>
from
the
time
I
have
it
in
my
power
,
I
give
a
great
deal
of
money
amongst
the
poor
;
I
pray
very
devoutly
,
and
go
to
my
execution
very
composedly
.
<EOS>
thus
I
lose
my
life
at
the
age
of
twenty
-
nine
,
in
which
short
time
I
believe
I
go
through
more
variety
of
scene
than
many
people
who
live
to
be
very
old
.
<EOS>
I
have
live
in
a
court
,
where
I
spend
my
time
in
coquetry
and
gayety
;
I
have
experience
what
it
be
to
have
one
of
those
violent
passion
which
make
the
mind
all
turbulence
and
anxiety
;
I
have
have
a
lover
whom
I
esteem
and
value
,
and
at
the
latter
part
of
my
life
I
be
raise
to
a
station
as
high
as
the
vain
woman
could
wish
.
<EOS>
but
in
all
these
various
change
I
never
enjoy
any
real
satisfaction
,
unless
in
the
little
time
I
live
retire
in
the
country
free
from
all
noise
and
hurry
,
and
while
I
be
conscious
<EOS>
I
be
the
object
of
the
love
and
esteem
of
a
man
of
sense
and
honor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
on
the
conclusion
of
this
history
Minos
pause
for
a
small
time
,
and
then
order
the
gate
to
be
throw
open
for
Anna
Boleyn
's
admittance
on
the
consideration
that
whoever
have
suffer
be
the
queen
for
four
year
,
and
be
sensible
during
all
that
time
of
the
real
misery
which
attend
that
exalted
station
,
ought
to
be
forgive
whatever
she
have
do
to
obtain
it.[11

It
be
to
be
hope
heedless
people
will
henceforth
be
more
cautious
what
they
burn

or
use
to
other
vile
purpose

when
they

the
fate
which

Milton

that
the
