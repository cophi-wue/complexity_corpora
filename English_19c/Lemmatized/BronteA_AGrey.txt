<EOS>
all
true
history
contain
instruction
;
though
,
in
some
,
the
treasure
may
be
hard
to
find
,
and
when
find
,
so
trivial
in
quantity
,
that
the
dry
,
shrivel
kernel
scarcely
compensate
for
the
trouble
of
crack
the
nut
.
 
<EOS>
whether
this
be
the
case
with
my
history
or
not
,
I
be
hardly
competent
to
judge
.
 
<EOS>
I
sometimes
think
it
may
prove
useful
to
some
,
and
entertain
to
other
;
but
the
world
may
judge
for
itself
.
 
<EOS>
shield
by
my
own
obscurity
,
and
by
the
lapse
of
year
,
and
a
few
fictitious
name
,
I
do
not
fear
to
venture
;
and
will
candidly
lay
before
the
public
what
I
would
not
disclose
to
the
most
intimate
friend
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
be
a
clergyman
of
the
north
of
England
,
who
be
deservedly
respect
by
all
who
know
him
;
and
,
in
his
young
day
,
live
pretty
comfortably
on
the
joint
income
of
a
small
incumbency
and
a
snug
little
property
of
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
,
who
marry
him
against
the
wish
of
her
friend
,
be
a
squire
's
daughter
,
and
a
woman
of
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
in
vain
it
be
represent
to
her
,
that
if
she
become
the
poor
parson
's
wife
,
she
must
relinquish
her
carriage
and
her
lady's
-
maid
,
and
all
the
luxury
and
elegancie
of
affluence
;
which
to
her
be
little
less
than
the
necessary
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
a
carriage
and
a
lady's
-
maid
be
great
convenience
;
but
,
thank
heaven
,
she
have
foot
to
carry
her
,
and
hand
to
minister
to
her
own
necessity
.
 
<EOS>
an
elegant
house
and
spacious
ground
be
not
to
be
despise
;
but
she
would
rather
live
in
a
cottage
with
Richard
Grey
than
in
a
palace
with
any
other
man
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
find
argument
of
no
avail
,
her
father
,
at
length
,
tell
the
lover
they
may
marry
if
they
please
;
but
,
in
so
do
,
his
daughter
would
forfeit
every
fraction
of
her
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
He
expect
this
would
cool
the
ardour
of
both
;
but
he
be
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
know
too
well
my
mother
's
superior
worth
not
to
be
sensible
that
she
be
a
valuable
fortune
in
herself
:
 
and
if
she
would
but
consent
to
embellish
his
humble
hearth
he
should
be
happy
to
take
her
on
any
term
;
while
she
,
on
her
part
,
would
rather
labour
with
her
own
hand
than
be
divide
from
the
man
she
love
,
whose
happiness
it
would
be
her
joy
to
make
,
and
who
be
already
one
with
her
in
heart
and
soul
.
 
<EOS>
so
her
fortune
go
to
swell
the
purse
of
a
wise
sister
,
who
have
marry
a
rich
nabob
;
and
she
,
to
the
wonder
and
compassionate
regret
of
all
who
know
her
,
go
to
bury
herself
in
the
homely
village
parsonage
among
the
hill
of
  
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
in
spite
of
all
this
,
and
in
spite
of
my
mother
's
high
spirit
and
my
father
's
whim
,
I
believe
you
may
search
all
England
through
,
and
fail
to
find
a
happy
couple
.
  
<EOS>
of
six
child
,
my
sister
Mary
and
myself
be
the
only
two
that
survive
the
peril
of
infancy
and
early
childhood
.
 
<EOS>
I
,
be
the
young
by
five
or
six
year
,
be
always
regard
as
the
child
,
and
the
pet
of
the
family
:
 
father
,
mother
,
and
sister
,
all
combine
to
spoil
me
 
not
by
foolish
indulgence
,
to
render
me
fractious
and
ungovernable
,
but
by
ceaseless
kindness
,
to
make
me
too
helpless
and
dependent
 
too
unfit
for
buffet
with
the
care
and
turmoil
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
and
I
be
bring
up
in
the
strict
seclusion
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
,
be
at
once
highly
accomplished
,
well
informed
,
and
fond
of
employment
,
take
the
whole
charge
of
our
education
on
herself
,
with
the
exception
of
latin
 
which
my
father
undertake
to
teach
us
 
so
that
we
never
even
go
to
school
;
and
,
as
there
be
no
society
in
the
neighbourhood
,
our
only
intercourse
with
the
world
consist
in
a
stately
tea
-
party
,
now
and
then
,
with
the
principal
farmer
and
tradespeople
of
the
vicinity
(
just
to
avoid
be
stigmatize
as
too
proud
to
consort
with
our
neighbour
)
,
and
an
annual
visit
to
our
paternal
grandfather
's
;
where
himself
,
our
kind
grandmamma
,
a
maiden
aunt
,
and
two
or
three
elderly
lady
and
gentleman
,
be
the
only
person
we
ever
see
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
our
mother
would
amuse
us
with
story
and
anecdote
of
her
young
day
,
which
,
while
they
entertain
us
amazingly
,
frequently
awake
 
in
me
,
at
least
 
a
secret
wish
to
see
a
little
more
of
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
she
must
have
be
very
happy
:
 
<EOS>
but
she
never
seem
to
regret
past
time
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
,
however
,
whose
temper
be
neither
tranquil
nor
cheerful
by
nature
,
often
unduly
vex
himself
with
thinking
of
the
sacrifice
his
dear
wife
have
make
for
him
;
and
trouble
his
head
with
revolve
endless
scheme
for
the
augmentation
of
his
little
fortune
,
for
her
sake
and
ours
.
 
<EOS>
in
vain
my
mother
assure
him
she
be
quite
satisfied
;
and
if
he
would
but
lay
by
a
little
for
the
child
,
we
should
all
have
plenty
,
both
for
time
present
and
to
come
:
 
but
save
be
not
my
father
's
forte
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
run
in
debt
<EOS>
(
at
least
,
my
mother
take
good
care
<EOS>
he
should
not
)
,
but
while
he
have
money
he
must
spend
it
:
 
<EOS>
he
like
to
see
his
house
comfortable
,
and
his
wife
and
daughter
well
clothe
,
and
well
attend
;
and
besides
,
he
be
charitably
disposed
,
and
like
to
give
to
the
poor
,
accord
to
his
mean
:
or
,
as
some
may
think
,
beyond
them
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
a
kind
friend
suggest
to
him
a
means
of
double
his
private
property
at
one
stroke
;
and
further
increase
it
,
hereafter
,
to
an
untold
amount
.
 
<EOS>
this
friend
be
a
merchant
,
a
man
of
enterprise
spirit
and
undoubted
talent
,
who
be
somewhat
straiten
in
his
mercantile
pursuit
for
want
of
capital
;
but
generously
propose
to
give
my
father
a
fair
share
of
his
profit
,
if
he
would
only
entrust
him
with
what
he
could
spare
;
and
he
think
he
may
safely
promise
that
whatever
sum
the
latter
choose
to
put
into
his
hand
,
it
should
bring
him
in
cent
.
<EOS>
per
cent
.
 
<EOS>
the
small
patrimony
be
speedily
sell
,
and
the
whole
of
its
price
be
deposit
in
the
hand
of
the
friendly
merchant
;
who
as
promptly
proceed
to
ship
his
cargo
,
and
prepare
for
his
voyage
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
be
delighted
,
so
be
we
all
,
with
our
brightening
prospect
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
present
,
it
be
true
,
we
be
reduce
to
the
narrow
income
of
the
curacy
;
but
my
father
seem
to
think
there
be
no
necessity
for
scrupulously
restrict
our
expenditure
to
that
;
so
,
with
a
stand
bill
at
Mr.
Jackson
's
,
another
at
Smith
's
,
and
a
third
at
Hobson
's
,
we
get
along
even
more
comfortably
than
before
:
 
though
my
mother
affirm
we
have
better
keep
within
bound
,
for
our
prospect
of
wealth
be
but
precarious
,
after
all
;
and
if
my
father
would
only
trust
everything
to
her
management
,
he
should
never
feel
himself
stint
:
 
but
he
,
for
once
,
be
incorrigible
.
  
<EOS>
what
happy
hour
Mary
<EOS>
and
I
have
pass
while
sit
at
our
work
by
the
fire
,
or
wander
on
the
heath
-
clothe
hill
,
or
idle
under
the
weeping
birch
(
the
only
considerable
tree
in
the
garden
)
,
talk
of
future
happiness
to
ourselves
and
our
parent
,
of
what
we
would
do
,
and
see
,
and
possess
;
with
no
firm
foundation
for
our
goodly
superstructure
than
the
rich
that
be
expect
to
flow
in
upon
us
from
the
success
of
the
worthy
merchant
's
speculation
.
 
<EOS>
Our
father
be
nearly
as
bad
as
ourselves
;
only
that
he
affect
not
to
be
so
much
in
earnest
:
 
express
his
bright
hope
and
sanguine
expectation
in
jest
and
playful
sally
,
that
always
strike
me
as
be
exceedingly
witty
and
pleasant
.
 
<EOS>
Our
mother
laugh
with
delight
to
see
him
so
hopeful
and
happy
:
 
but
still
she
fear
he
be
set
his
heart
too
much
upon
the
matter
;
and
once
I
hear
her
whisper
as
she
leave
the
room
,
"
God
grant
he
be
not
disappointed
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
he
would
bear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
disappoint
he
be
;
and
bitterly
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
It
come
like
a
thunder
-
clap
on
us
all
,
that
the
vessel
which
contain
our
fortune
have
be
wreck
,
and
go
to
the
bottom
with
all
its
store
,
together
with
several
of
the
crew
,
and
the
unfortunate
merchant
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
grieve
for
him
;
I
be
grieve
for
the
overthrow
of
all
our
air
-
build
castle
:
 
but
,
with
the
elasticity
of
youth
,
I
soon
recover
the
shook
.
  
<EOS>
though
rich
have
charm
,
poverty
have
no
terror
for
an
inexperienced
girl
like
me
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
to
say
the
truth
,
there
be
something
exhilarate
in
the
idea
of
be
drive
to
strait
,
and
throw
upon
our
own
resource
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
wish
papa
,
mamma
,
and
Mary
<EOS>
be
all
of
the
same
mind
as
myself
;
and
then
,
instead
of
lament
past
calamity
we
may
all
cheerfully
set
to
work
to
remedy
them
;
and
the
great
the
difficulty
,
the
hard
our
present
privation
,
the
great
should
be
our
cheerfulness
to
endure
the
latter
,
and
our
vigour
to
contend
against
the
former
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
do
not
lament
,
but
she
brood
continually
over
the
misfortune
,
and
sink
into
a
state
of
dejection
from
which
no
effort
of
mine
could
rouse
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
possibly
bring
her
to
regard
the
matter
on
its
bright
side
as
I
do
:
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
I
be
so
fearful
of
be
charge
with
childish
frivolity
,
or
stupid
insensibility
,
that
I
carefully
keep
most
of
my
bright
idea
and
cheer
notion
to
myself
;
well
know
they
could
not
be
appreciate
.
  
<EOS>
My
mother
think
only
of
console
my
father
,
and
pay
our
debt
and
retrench
our
expenditure
by
every
available
mean
;
but
my
father
be
completely
overwhelm
by
the
calamity
:
 
health
,
strength
,
and
spirit
sink
beneath
the
blow
,
and
he
never
wholly
recover
them
.
 
<EOS>
in
vain
my
mother
strove
to
cheer
him
,
by
appeal
to
his
piety
,
to
his
courage
,
to
his
affection
for
herself
and
us
.
 
<EOS>
that
very
affection
be
his
great
torment
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
for
our
sake
he
have
so
ardently
long
to
increase
his
fortune
 
<EOS>
it
be
our
interest
that
have
lend
such
brightness
to
his
hope
,
and
that
impart
such
bitterness
to
his
present
distress
.
<EOS>
He
now
torment
himself
with
remorse
at
have
neglect
my
mother
's
advice
;
which
would
at
least
have
save
him
from
the
additional
burden
of
debt
 
<EOS>
he
vainly
reproach
himself
for
have
bring
her

the
dignity
,
the
ease
,
the
luxury
of
her
former
station
to
toil
with
him
through
the
care
and
toil
of
poverty
.
<EOS>
It
be
gall
and
wormwood
to
his
soul
to
see
that
splendid
,
highly

accomplish
woman
,
once
so
courted
and
admire
,
transform
into
an
active
managing
housewife
,
with
hand

continually
occupy
with
household
labour
and
household
economy

<EOS>
the
very
willingness
with
which
she
perform
these
duty
,
the
cheerfulness
with
which
she
bear
her
reverse
,
and
the
kindness
which
withhold
her
from
impute
the
small
blame
to
him
,
be
all
pervert
by
this
ingenious
self

tormentor
into
further
aggravation
of
his
suffering

<EOS>
and
thus
the
mind
prey
upon
the

and
disorder
the

and
they
in
turn
increase
the

,
till
by
action

reaction
<EOS>
his
health
be
seriously
impair

not

us
could
convince
him
that
the
aspect
of
our
affair
be
not
half
so
gloomy

so
utterly

then

one
could
do
it
so
well
as
herself
:
 
so
that
whenever
I
offer
to
assist
her
,
I
receive
such
an
answer
as
"
no
,
love
<EOS>
,
you
can
not
indeed
 
there
be
nothing
here
you
can
do
.
 
<EOS>
go
and
help
your
sister
,
or
get
her
to
take
a
walk
with
you
 
<EOS>
tell
her
she
must
not
sit
so
much
,
and
stay
so
constantly
in
the
house
as
she
do
 
<EOS>
she
may
well
look
thin
and
dejected

<EOS>
"
Mary
,
mamma
say
I
be
to
help
you
;
or
get
you
to
take
a
walk
with
me
;
she
say
you
may
well
look
thin
and
dejected
,
if
you
sit
so
constantly
in
the
house

<EOS>
"
help
me
you
can
not
,
Agnes

and
I
can
not
go
out
with
you
 
<EOS>
I
have
far
too
much
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
let
me
help
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
,
indeed
,
dear
child
.
 
<EOS>
go
and
practise
your
music
,
or
play
with
the
kitten
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
always
plenty
of
sew
on
hand
;
but
I
have
not
be
teach
to
cut
out
a
single
garment
,
and
except
plain
hemming
and
seaming
,
there
be
little
I
could
do
,
even
in
that
line
;
for
they
both
assert
that
it
be
far
easy
to
do
the
work
themselves
than
to
prepare
it
for
me
:
 
and
besides
,
they
like
better
to
see
me
prosecute
my
study
,
or
amuse
myself
 
<EOS>
it
be
time
enough
for
me
to
sit
bend
over
my
work
,
like
a
grave
matron
,
when
my
favourite
little
pussy
be
become
a
steady
old
cat
.
 
<EOS>
under
such
circumstance
,
although
I
be
not
many
degree
more
useful
than
the
kitten
,
my
idleness
be
not
entirely
without
excuse
.
  
<EOS>
through
all
our
trouble
,
I
never
but
once
hear
my
mother
complain
of
our
want
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
as
summer
be
come
on
she
observe
to
Mary
and
me
,
"
what
a
desirable
thing
it
would
be
for
your
papa
to
spend
a
few
week
at
a
watering
-
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
convince
the
sea
-
air
and
the
change
of
scene
would
be
of
incalculable
service
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
then
,
you
see
,
there
be
no
money
,
"
she
add
,
with
a
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
We
both
wish
exceedingly
that
the
thing
may
be
do
,
and
lament
greatly
that
it
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
!
"
say
she
,
"
it
be
no
use
complaining
.
 
<EOS>
possibly
something
may
be
do
to
further
the
project
after
all
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
,
you
be
a
beautiful
drawer
.
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
say
to
do
a
few
more
picture
in
your
good
style
,
and
get
them
frame
,
with
the
water

colour
drawing
you
have
already
do

and
try
to
dispose
of
them

some
liberal

dealer

who

their
merit

Mamma

I

It

"
You
,
Agnes

<EOS>
well
,
who
know
?
 
<EOS>
You
draw
pretty
well

too
:
 
if
you
choose
some
simple
piece
for
your
subject

I

you
will
be
able

produce
something
we
shall
all
be
proud
to
exhibit

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
have
another
scheme
in
my
head
,
mamma
,
and
have
have
long
,
only
I
do
not
like
to
mention
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
indeed
!
<EOS>
pray
tell
us
what
it
be

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
be
a
governess

<EOS>
My
mother
utter
an
exclamation
of
surprise
,
and
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
My
sister
drop
her
work
in
astonishment

exclaim
,
"
you
a
governess

Agnes

<EOS>
what
can
you
be
dream
of
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
anything
so
very
extraordinary
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
be
able
to
instruct
great
girl
;
but
surely
I
could
teach
little
one
:
 
and
I
should
like
it
so
much
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
fond
of
child
.
 
<EOS>
do
let
me
,
mamma
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
my
love
,
you
have
not
learn
to
take
care
of
YOURSELF
yet
:
and
young
child
require
more
judgment
and
experience
to
manage
than
eld
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
,
mamma
,
I
be
above
eighteen
,
and
quite
able
to
take
care
of
myself
,
and
other
too
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
half
the
wisdom
and
prudence
<EOS>
I
possess
,
because
I
have
never
be
try
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
only
think
,
"
say
Mary
,
"
what
would
you
do
in
a
house
full
of
stranger
,
without
me
or
mamma
to
speak
and
act
for
you
 
with
a
parcel
of
child
,
besides
yourself
,
to
attend
to
;
and
no
one
to
look
to
for
advice
?
 
<EOS>
You
would
not
even
know
what
clothe
to
put
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
,
because
I
always
do
as
you
bid
me
,
I
have
no
judgment
of
my
own
:
 
but
only
try
me
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
I
ask
 
<EOS>
and
you
shall
see
what
I
can
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
at
that
moment
my
father
enter
and
the
subject
of
our
discussion
be
explain
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
,
my
little
agne
a
governess
!
<EOS>
"
cry
he
,
and
,
in
spite
of
his
dejection
,
he
laugh
at
the
idea
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
papa
,
do
not
you
say
anything
against
it
:
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
it
so
much
;
and
I
be
sure
I
could
manage
delightfully
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
my
darling
,
we
could
not
spare
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
a
tear
glisten
in
his
eye
as
he
add
"
no
,
no
!
<EOS>
afflict
as
we
be
,
surely
we
be
not
bring
to
that
pass
yet

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
!
"
say
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
necessity
whatever
for
such
a
step
;
it
be
merely
a
whim
of
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
so
you
must
hold
your
tongue
,
you
naughty
girl
;
for
,
though
you
be
so
ready
to
leave
us
,
you
know
very
well
we
can
not
part
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
silence
for
that
day
,
and
for
many
succeed
one
;
but
still
I
do
not
wholly
relinquish
my
darling
scheme
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
get
her
drawing
material
,
and
steadily
set
to
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
mine
too
;
but
while
I
draw
,
I
think
of
other
thing
.
 
<EOS>
how
delightful
it
would
be
to
be
a
governess
!
 
<EOS>
to
go
out
into
the
world
;
to
enter
upon
a
new
life
;
to
act
for
myself
;
to
exercise
my
unused
faculty
;
to
try
my
unknown
power
;
to
earn
my
own
maintenance
,
and
something
to
comfort
and
help
my
father
,
mother
,
and
sister
,
besides
exonerate
them
from
the
provision
of
my
food
and
clothing
;
to
show
papa
what
his
little
Agnes
could
do
;
to
convince
mamma
and
Mary
that
I
be
not
quite
the
helpless
,
thoughtless
being
they
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
how
charming
to
be
entrust
with
the
care
and
education
of
child
!
 
<EOS>
whatever
other
say
,
I
feel
I
be
fully
competent
to
the
task
:
 
<EOS>
the
clear
remembrance
of
my
own
thought
in
early
childhood
would
be
a
sure
guide
than
the
instruction
of
the
most
mature
adviser
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
<EOS>
but
to
turn
from
my
little
pupil
to
myself
at
their
age
,
and
I
should
know
,
at
once
,
how
to
win
their
confidence
and
affection
:
 
how
to
waken
the
contrition
of
the
err
;
how
to
embolden
the
timid
and
console
the
afflict
;
how
to
make
Virtue
practicable
,
instruction
desirable
,
and
religion
lovely
and
comprehensible
.
     
<EOS>
delightful
task
!
<EOS>
to
teach
the
young
idea
how
to
shoot
!
  
<EOS>
to
train
the
tender
plant
,
and
watch
their
bud
unfold
day
by
day
!
  
<EOS>
influence
by
so
many
inducement
,
I
determine
still
to
persevere
;
though
the
fear
of
displease
my
mother
,
or
distress
my
father
's
feeling
,
prevent
me
from
resume
the
subject
for
several
day
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
again
,
I
mention
it
to
my
mother
in
private
;
and
,
with
some
difficulty
,
get
her
to
promise
to
assist
me
with
her
endeavour
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
's
reluctant
consent
be
next
obtain
,
and
then
,
though
Mary
still
sigh
her
disapproval
,
my
dear
,
kind
mother
begin
to
look
out
for
a
situation
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
write
to
my
father
's
relation
,
and
consult
the
newspaper
advertisement
 
her
own
relation
<EOS>
she
have
long
drop
all
communication
with
:
 
a
formal
interchange
of
occasional
letter
<EOS>
be
all
she
have
ever
have
since
her
marriage
,
and
she
would
not
at
any
time
have
apply
to
them
in
a
case
of
this
nature
.
 
<EOS>
but
so
long
and
so
entire
have
be
my
parent
'
seclusion
from
the
world
,
that
many
week
elapse
before
a
suitable
situation
could
be
procure
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
to
my
great
joy
,
it
be
decree
that
I
should
take
charge
of
the
young
family
of
a
certain
Mrs.
Bloomfield
;
whom
my
kind
,
prim
aunt
Grey
have
know
in
her
youth
,
and
assert
to
be
a
very
nice
woman
.
 
<EOS>
Her
husband
be
a
retire
tradesman
,
who
have
realize
a
very
comfortable
fortune
;
but
could
not
be
prevail
upon
to
give
a
great
salary
than
twenty
-
five
pound
to
the
instructress
of
his
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
,
however
,
be
glad
to
accept
this
,
rather
than
refuse
the
situation
 
which
my
parent
be
incline
to
think
the
well
plan
.
  
<EOS>
but
some
week
more
be
yet
to
be
devoted
to
preparation
.
 
<EOS>
how
long
,
how
tedious
those
week
appear
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
yet
they
be
happy
one
in
the
main
 
full
of
bright
hope
and
ardent
expectation
.
<EOS>
with
what
peculiar
pleasure
I
assist
at
the
making
of
my
new
clothe
,
and
,
subsequently
,
the
packing
of
my
trunk
!
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
feeling
of
bitterness
mingle
with
the
latter
occupation
too
;
and
when
it
be
do
 
when
all
be
ready
for
my
departure
on
the
morrow
,
and
the
last
night
at
home
approach
 
a
sudden
anguish
seem
to
swell
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
look
so
sad
,
and
speak
so
very
kindly
,
that
I
could
scarcely
keep
my
eye
from
overflow
:
 
but
I
still
affect
to
be
gay
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
take
my
last
ramble
with
Mary
on
the
moor
,
my
last
walk
in
the
garden
,
and
round
the
house
;
I
have
feed
,
with
her
,
<EOS>
our
pet
pigeon
for
the
last
time
 
the
pretty
creature
that
we
have
tame
to
peck
their
food
from
our
hand
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
give
a
farewell
stroke
to
all
their
silky
back
as
they
crowd
in
my
lap
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
tenderly
kiss
my
own
peculiar
favourite
,
the
pair
of
snow
-
white
fantail
;
I
have
play
my
last
tune
on
the
old
familiar
piano
,
and
sing
my
last
song
to
papa
:
 
not
the
last
,
I
hope
,
but
the
last
for
what
appear
to
me
a
very
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
perhaps
,
when
I
do
these
thing
again
it
would
be
with
different
feeling
:
 
<EOS>
circumstance
may
be
change
,
and
this
house
may
never
be
my
settle
home
again
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
little
friend
,
the
kitten
,
would
certainly
be
change
:
 
she
be
already
grow
a
fine
cat
;
and
when
I
return
,
even
for
a
hasty
visit
at
Christmas
,
would
,
most
likely
,
have
forget
both
her
playmate
and
her
merry
prank
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
romp
with
her
for
the
last
time
;
and
when
I
stroke
her
soft
bright
fur
,
while
she
lie
purr
herself
to
sleep
in
my
lap
,
it
be
with
a
feeling
of
sadness
<EOS>
I
could
not
easily
disguise
.
 
<EOS>
then
at
bed
-
time
,
when
I
retire
with
Mary
to
our
quiet
little
chamber
,
where
already
my
drawer
be
clear
out
and
my
share
of
the
bookcase
be
empty
 
and
where
,
hereafter
,
she
would
have
to
sleep
alone
,
in
dreary
solitude
,
as
she
express
it
 
<EOS>
my
heart
sink
more
than
ever
:
 
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
I
have
be
selfish
and
wrong
to
persist
in
leave
her
;
and
when
I
knelt
once
more
beside
our
little
bed
,
I
pray
for
a
blessing
on
her
and
on
my
parent
more
fervently
than
ever
I
have
do
before
.
 
<EOS>
to
conceal
my
emotion
,
I
bury
my
face
in
my
hand
,
and
they
be
presently
bathe
in
tear
.
 
<EOS>
I
perceive
,
on
rise
,
that
she
have
be
cry
too
:
 
but
neither
of
us
speak
;
and
in
silence
we
betook
ourselves
to
our
repose
,
creep
more
closely
together
from
the
consciousness
that
we
be
to
part
so
soon
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
morning
bring
a
renewal
of
hope
and
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
depart
early
;
that
the
conveyance
which
take
me
(
a
gig
,
hire
from
Mr.
Smith
,
the
draper
,
grocer
,
and
tea
-
dealer
of
the
village
)
may
return
the
same
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
rise
,
wash
,
dress
,
swallow
a
hasty
breakfast
,
<EOS>
receive
the
fond
embrace
of
my
father
,
mother
,
and
sister
,
kiss
the
cat
 
to
the
great
scandal
of
Sally
,
<EOS>
the
maid
 
shake
hand
with
her
,
mount
the
gig
,
draw
my
veil
over
my
face
,
and
then
,
but
not
till
then
,
burst
into
a
flood
of
tear
.
 
<EOS>
the
gig
roll
on
<EOS>
;
I
look
back
;
my
dear
mother
and
sister
be
still
stand
at
the
door
,
look
after
me
,
and
wave
their
adieux
.
 
<EOS>
I
return
their
salute
,
and
pray
God
to
bless
them
from
my
heart
:
we
descend
the
hill
,
and
I
could
see
them
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
coldish
mornin
"
for
you
,
Miss
Agnes
,
"
observe
Smith
;
"
and
a
darksome
"
un
too
;
but
we
be
happen
get
to
yon
spot
<EOS>
afore
there
come
much
rain
to
signify
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
hope
so
,
"
reply
I
,
as
calmly
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
come
a
good
sup
last
night
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
this
cold
wind
will
happen
keep
it
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
end
our
colloquy
.
 
<EOS>
We
cross
the
valley
,
and
begin
to
ascend
the
opposite
hill
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
be
toil
up
,
I
look
back
again
;
there
be
the
village
spire
,
and
the
old
grey
parsonage
beyond
it
,
bask
in
a
slant
beam
of
sunshine
 
<EOS>
it
be
but
a
sickly
ray
,
but
the
village
and
surround
hill
be
all
in
sombre
shade
,
and
I
hail
the
wander
beam
as
a
propitious
oman
to
my
home
.
 
<EOS>
with
clasped
hand
I
fervently
implore
a
blessing
on
its
inhabitant
,
and
hastily
turn
away
;
for
I
see
the
sunshine
be
depart
;
and
I
carefully
avoid
another
glance
,
lest
I
should
see
it
in
gloomy
shadow
,
like
the
rest
of
the
landscape
.
     
<EOS>
FIRST
lesson
in
the
art
of
instruction
  
<EOS>
as
we
drive
along
,
my
spirit
revive
again
,
and
I
turn
,
with
pleasure
,
to
the
contemplation
of
the
new
life
upon
which
I
be
enter
.
 
<EOS>
but
though
it
be
not
far
past
the
middle
of
September
,
the
heavy
cloud
and
strong
north
-
easterly
wind
combine
to
render
the
day
extremely
cold
and
dreary
;
and
the
journey
seem
a
very
long
one
,
for
,
as
Smith
observe
,
the
road
be
"
very
heavy
"
;
and
certainly
,
his
horse
be
very
heavy
too
:
 
<EOS>
it
crawl
up
the
hill
,
and
creep
down
them
,
and
only
condescend
to
shake
its
side
in
a
trot
where
the
road
be
at
a
dead
level
or
a
very
gentle
slope
,
which
be
rarely
the
case
in
those
rugged
region
;
so
that
it
be
nearly
one
o'clock
before
we
reach
the
place
of
our
destination
.
<EOS>
yet
,
after
all
,
when
we
enter
the
lofty
iron
gateway
,
when
we
drive
softly
up
the
smooth
,
well
-
roll
carriage
-
road
,
with
the
green
lawn
on
each
side
,
stud
with
young
tree
,
and
approach
the
new
but
stately
mansion
of
Wellwood
,
rise
above
its
mushroom
poplar
-
grove
,
my
heart
fail
me
,
and
I
wish
it
be
a
mile
or
two
farther
off
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
I
must
stand
alone
:
there
be
no
retreating
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
enter
that
house
,
and
introduce
myself
among
its
strange
inhabitant
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
be
it
to
be
do
?
 
<EOS>
true
,
I
be
near
nineteen
;
but
,
thank
to
my
retire
life
and
the
protect
care
of
my
mother
and
sister
,
I
well
know
that
many
a
girl
of
fifteen
,
or
under
,
be
gift
with
a
more
womanly
address
,
and
great
ease
and
self
-
possession
,
than
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
if
Mrs.
Bloomfield
be
a
kind
,
motherly
woman
,
I
may
do
very
well
,
after
all
;
and
the
child
,
of
course
,
I
should
soon
be
at
ease
with
them
 
and
Mr.
Bloomfield
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
I
should
have
but
little
to
do
with
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
calm
,
be
calm
,
whatever
happen
,
"
I
say
within
myself
;
and
truly
I
keep
this
resolution
so
well
,
and
be
so
fully
occupy
in
steady
my
nerve
and
stifle
the
rebellious
flutter
of
my
heart
,
that
when
I
be
admit
into
the
hall
and
usher
into
the
presence
of
Mrs.
Bloomfield
,
I
almost
forget
to
answer
her
polite
salutation
;
and
it
afterwards
strike
me
,
that
the
little
I
do
say
be
speak
in
the
tone
of
one
half
-
dead
or
half
-
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
the
lady
,
too
,
be
somewhat
chilly
in
her
manner
,
as
I
discover
when
I
have
time
to
reflect
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
tall
,
spare
,
stately
woman
,
with
thick
black
hair
,
cold
grey
eye
,
and
extremely
sallow
complexion
.
  
<EOS>
with
due
politeness
,
however
,
she
show
me
my
bedroom
,
and
leave
me
there
to
take
a
little
refreshment
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
somewhat
dismay
at
my
appearance
on
look
in
the
glass
:
 
<EOS>
the
cold
wind
have
swell
and
redden
my
hand
,
uncurled
and
entangle
my
hair
,
and
dye
my
face
of
a
pale
purple
;
add
to
this
my
collar
be
horridly
crumple
,
my
frock
splash
with
mud
,
my
foot
clothe
in
stout
new
boot
,
and
as
the
trunk
be
not
bring
up
,
there
be
no
remedy
;
so
have
smooth
my
hair
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
repeatedly
twitch
my
obdurate
collar
,
I
proceed
to
clomp
down
the
two
flight
of
stair
,
philosophize
as
I
go
;
and
with
some
difficulty
find
my
way
into
the
room
where
Mrs.
Bloomfield
await
me
.
  
<EOS>
She
lead
me
into
the
dining
-
room
,
where
the
family
luncheon
have
be
lay
out
.
 
<EOS>
some
beefsteak
and
half
-
cold
potato
be
set
before
me
;
and
while
I
dine
upon
these
,
she
sit
opposite
,
watch
me
(
as
I
think
)
and
endeavour
to
sustain
something
like
a
conversation
 
consist
chiefly
of
a
succession
of
commonplace
remark
,
express
with
frigid
formality
:
 
but
this
may
be
more
my
fault
than
her
,
for
I
really
could
not
converse
.
 
<EOS>
in
fact
,
my
attention
be
almost
wholly
absorb
in
my
dinner
:
 
not
from
ravenous
appetite
,
but
from
distress
at
the
toughness
of
the
beefsteak
,
and
the
numbness
of
my
hand
,
almost
palsy
by
their
five
-
hour
'
exposure
to
the
bitter
wind
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
gladly
have
eat
the
potato
and
let
the
meat
alone
,
but
have
get
a
large
piece
of
the
latter
on
to
my
plate
,
I
could
not
be
so
impolite
as
to
leave
it
;
so
,
after
many
awkward
and
unsuccessful
attempt
to
cut
it
with
the
knife
,
or
tear
it
with
the
fork
,
or
pull
it
asunder
between
them
,
sensible
that
the
awful
lady
be
a
spectator
to
the
whole
transaction
,
I
at
last
desperately
grasp
the
knife
and
fork
in
my
fist
,
like
a
child
of
two
year
old
,
and
fall
to
work
with
all
the
little
strength
I
possess
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
need
some
apology
 
with
a
feeble
attempt
at
a
laugh
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
"
My
hand
be
so
benumbed
with
the
cold
that
I
can
scarcely
handle
my
knife
and
fork
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
you
would
find
it
cold
,
"
reply
she
with
a
cool
,
immutable
gravity
that
do
not
serve
to
reassure
me
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
ceremony
be
conclude
,
she
lead
me
into
the
sit
-
room
again
,
where
she
ring
and
send
for
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
them
not
very
far
advanced
in
their
attainment
,
"
say
she
,
"
for
I
have
have
so
little
time
to
attend
to
their
education
myself
,
and
we
have
think
them
too
young
for
a
governess
till
now
;
but
I
think
they
be
clever
child
,
and
very
apt
to
learn
,
especially
the
little
boy
<EOS>
;
he
be
,
I
think
,
the
flower
of
the
flock
 
a
generous
,
noble
-
spirited
boy
,
one
to
be
lead
,
but
not
drive
,
and
remarkable
for
always
speak
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem
to
scorn
deception
"
(
this
be
good
news
)
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
sister
Mary
Ann
will
require
watch
<EOS>
,
"
continue
she
,
"
but
she
be
a
very
good
girl
upon
the
whole
;
though
I
wish
her
to
be
keep
out
of
the
nursery
as
much
as
possible
,
as
she
be
now
almost
six
year
old
,
and
may
acquire
bad
habit
from
the
nurse
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
order
her
crib
to
be
place
in
your
room
,
and
if
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
overlook
her
washing
and
dressing
,
and
take
charge
of
her
clothe
<EOS>
,
she
nee
have
nothing
further
to
do
with
the
nursery
maid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
reply
I
be
quite
willing
to
do
so
;
and
at
that
moment
my
young
pupil
enter
the
apartment
,
with
their
two
young
sister
.
<EOS>
Master
Tom
Bloomfield
be
a
well
-
grow
boy
of
seven
,
with
a
somewhat
wiry
frame
,
flaxen
hair
,
blue
eye
,
small
turn
-
up
nose
,
and
fair
complexion
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
Ann
be
a
tall
girl
too
,
somewhat
dark
like
her
mother
,
but
with
a
round
full
face
and
a
high
colour
in
her
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
the
second
sister
be
Fanny
,
a
very
pretty
little
girl
;
Mrs.
Bloomfield
assure
me
<EOS>
she
be
a
remarkably
gentle
child
,
and
require
encouragement
:
 
<EOS>
she
have
not
learn
anything
yet
;
but
in
a
few
day
,
she
would
be
four
year
old
,
and
then
she
may
take
her
first
lesson
in
the
alphabet
,
and
be
promote
to
the
schoolroom
.
 
<EOS>
the
remain
one
be
Harriet
,
a
little
broad
,
fat
,
merry
,
playful
thing
of
scarcely
two
,
that
I
covet
more
than
all
the
rest
 
<EOS>
but
with
her
I
have
nothing
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
I
talk
to
my
little
pupil
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
try
to
render
myself
agreeable
;
but
with
little
success
I
fear
,
for
their
mother
's
presence
keep
me
under
an
unpleasant
restraint
.
 
<EOS>
They
,
however
,
be
remarkably
free
from
shyness
.
 
<EOS>
They
seem
bold
,
lively
child
,
and
I
hope
I
should
soon
be
on
friendly
term
with
them
 
the
little
boy
especially
,
of
whom
I
have
hear
such
a
favourable
character
from
his
mamma
.
 
<EOS>
in
Mary
Ann
there
be
a
certain
affected
simper
,
and
a
craving
for
notice
,
that
I
be
sorry
to
observe
.
 
<EOS>
but
her
brother
claim
all
my
attention
to
himself
;
he
stand
bolt
upright
between
me
and
the
fire
,
with
his
hand
behind
his
back
,
talk
away
like
an
orator
,
occasionally
interrupt
his
discourse
with
a
sharp
reproof
to
his
sister
when
they
make
too
much
noise
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Tom
,
what
a
darling
you
be
!
"
exclaim
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
and
kiss
dear
mamma
;
and
then
will
not
you
show
Miss
Grey
<EOS>
your
schoolroom
,
and
your
nice
new
book
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
kiss
you
,
mamma
;
but
I
WILL
show
Miss
Grey
my
schoolroom
,
and
my
new
book
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
my
schoolroom
,
and
my
new
book
,
Tom
,
"
say
Mary
Ann
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
mine
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
MINE
,
"
reply
he
decisively
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
along
,
Miss
Grey
 
<EOS>
I
will
escort
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
the
room
and
book
have
be
show
,
with
some
bickering
between
the
brother
and
sister
that
I
do
my
utmost
to
appease
or
mitigate
,
Mary
Ann
bring
me
her
doll
,
and
begin
to
be
very
loquacious
on
the
subject
of
its
fine
clothe
,
its
bed
,
its
chest
of
drawer
,
and
other
appurtenance
;
but
Tom
tell
her
to
hold
her
clamour
,
that
Miss
Grey
may
see
his
rocking
-
horse
,
which
,
with
a
most
important
bustle
,
he
drag
forth
from
its
corner
into
the
middle
of
the
room
,
loudly
call
on
me
to
attend
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
order
his
sister
to
hold
the
rein
,
he
mount
,
and
make
me
stand
for
ten
minute
,
watch
how
manfully
he
use
his
whip
and
spur
.
 
<EOS>
meantime
,
however
,
I
admire
Mary
Ann
's
pretty
doll
,
and
all
its
possession
;
and
then
tell
Master
Tom
he
be
a
capital
rider
,
but
I
hope
he
would
not
use
his
whip
and
spur
so
much
when
he
ride
a
real
pony
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
I
will
!
"
<EOS>
say
he
,
lay
on
with
redouble
ardour
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
cut
into
him
like
smoke
!
 
<EOS>
Eeh
!
<EOS>
my
word
!
<EOS>
but
he
shall
sweat
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
very
shocking
;
but
I
hope
in
time
to
be
able
to
work
a
reformation
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
you
must
put
on
your
bonnet
and
shawl
,
"
say
the
little
hero
,
"
and
I
will
show
you
my
garden
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
MINE
,
"
say
Mary
Ann
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
lift
his
fist
with
a
menacing
gesture
;
she
utter
a
loud
,
shrill
scream
,
run
to
the
other
side
of
me
,
and
make
a
face
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
surely
,
Tom
,
you
would
not
strike
your
sister
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
never
see
you
do
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
sometimes
:
 
I
be
oblige
to
do
it
now
and
then
to
keep
her
in
order
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
not
your
business
to
keep
her
in
order
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
that
be
for
"
  
"
well
,
now
go
and
put
on
your
bonnet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
 
<EOS>
it
be
so
very
cloudy
and
cold
,
it
seem
likely
to
rain
;
 
and
you
know
I
have
have
a
long
drive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
matter
 
you
MUST
come
;
I
shall
allow
of
no
excuse
,
"
reply
the
consequential
little
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
as
it
be
the
first
day
of
our
acquaintance
,
I
think
I
may
as
well
indulge
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
too
cold
for
Mary
Ann
to
venture
,
so
she
stay
with
her
mamma
,
to
the
great
relief
of
her
brother
,
who
like
to
have
me
all
to
himself

the
garden
be
a
large
one
,
and
tastefully
lay
out
;
besides
several
splendid
dahlias
,
there
be
some
other
fine
flower
still
in
bloom
:
 
but
my
companion
would
not
give
me
time
to
examine
them
:
<EOS>
I
must
go
with
him
,
across
the
wet
grass
,
to
a
remote
sequester
corner
,
the
most
important
place
in
the
ground
,
because
it
contain
his
garden
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
two
round
bed
,
stock
with
a
variety
of
plant
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
there
be
a
pretty
little
rose
-
tree
.
 
<EOS>
I
pause
to
admire
its
lovely
blossom
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
never
mind
that
!
"
say
he
,
contemptuously
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
only
Mary
Ann
's
garden
;
look
,
this
be
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
I
have
observe
every
flower
,
and
listen
to
a
disquisition
on
every
plant
,
I
be
permit
to
depart
;
but
first
,
with
great
pomp
,
he
pluck
a
polyanthus
and
present
it
to
me
,
as
one
confer
a
prodigious
favour
.
 
<EOS>
I
observe
,
on
the
grass
about
his
garden
,
certain
apparatus
of
stick
and
corn
,
and
ask
what
they
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
trap
for
bird
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
catch
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
say
they
do
harm
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
what
do
you
do
with
them
when
you
catch
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
different
thing
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
I
give
them
to
the
cat
;
sometimes
I
cut
them
in
piece
with
my
penknife
;
but
the
next
,
I
mean
to
roast
alive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
do
you
mean
to
do
such
a
horrible
thing
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
for
two
reason
:
 
first
,
to
see
how
long
it
will
live
 
and
then
,
to
see
what
it
will
taste
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
do
not
you
know
it
be
extremely
wicked
to
do
such
thing
?
<EOS>
remember
,
the
bird
can
feel
as
well
as
you
;
and
think
,
how
would
you
like
it
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
that
be
nothing
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
a
bird
,
and
I
can
not
feel
what
I
do
to
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
will
have
to
feel
it
some
time
,
Tom
:
 
<EOS>
you
have
hear
where
wicked
people
go
to
when
they
die
;
and
if
you
do
not
leave
off
torture
innocent
bird
,
remember
,
you
will
have
to
go
there
,
and
suffer
just
what
you
have
make
them
suffer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
pooh
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
not
.
 
<EOS>
Papa
know
how
I
treat
them
,
and
he
never
blame
me
for
it
:
 
<EOS>
he
say
it
be
just
what
he
use
to
do
when
he
be
a
boy
.
 
<EOS>
last
summer
,
he
give
me
a
nest
full
of
young
sparrow
,
and
he
see
me
pull
off
their
leg
and
wing
,
and
head
,
and
never
say
anything
;
except
that
they
be
nasty
thing
,
and
I
must
not
let
them
soil
my
trouser
:
 
end
<EOS>
Uncle
Robson
be
there
too
,
and
he
laugh
,
and
say
I
be
a
fine
boy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
would
your
mamma
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
she
do
not
care
!
<EOS>
she
say
it
be
a
pity
to
kill
the
pretty
singing
bird
,
but
the
naughty
sparrow
,
and
mouse
,
and
rat
,
I
may
do
what
I
like
with
.
 
<EOS>
so
now
,
Miss
Grey
,
you
see
it
be
not
wicked
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
still
think
it
be
,
Tom
;
and
perhaps
your
papa
and
mamma
would
think
so
too
,
if
they
think
much
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
"
I
internally
add
,
"
they
may
say
what
they
please
,
but
I
be
determine
you
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
,
as
long
as
I
have
power
to
prevent
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
next
take
me
across
the
lawn
to
see
his
mole
-
trap
,
and
then
into
the
stack
-
yard
to
see
his
weasel
-
trap
:
 
one
of
which
,
to
his
great
joy
,
contain
a
dead
weasel
;
and
then
into
the
stable
to
see
,
not
the
fine
carriage
-
horse
,
but
a
little
rough
colt
,
which
he
inform
me
have
be
breed
on
purpose
for
him
,
and
he
be
to
ride
it
as
soon
as
it
be
properly
train
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
to
amuse
the
little
fellow
,
and
listen
to
all
his
chatter
as
complacently
as
I
could
;
for
I
think
if
he
have
any
affection
at
all
,
I
would
endeavour
to
win
them
;
and
then
,
in
time
,
I
may
be
able
to
show
him
the
error
of
his
way
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
look
in
vain
for
that
generous
,
noble
spirit
his
mother
talk
of
;
though
I
could
see
he
be
not
without
a
certain
degree
of
quickness
and
penetration
,
when
he
choose
to
exert
it
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
re
-
enter
the
house
it
be
nearly
tea
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
Master
Tom
tell
me
that
,
as
papa
be
from
home
,
he
and
I
and
Mary
Ann
be
to
have
tea
with
mamma
,
for
a
treat
;
for
,
on
such
occasion
,
she
always
dine
at
luncheon
-
time
with
them
,
instead
of
at
six
o'clock
.
<EOS>
soon
after
tea
,
Mary
Ann
go
to
bed
,
but
Tom
favour
us
with
his
company
and
conversation
till
eight
.
 
<EOS>
after
he
be
go
,
Mrs.
Bloomfield
further
enlighten
me
on
the
subject
of
her
child
's
disposition
and
acquirement
,
and
on
what
they
be
to
learn
,
and
how
they
be
to
be
manage
,
and
caution
me
to
mention
their
defect
to
no
one
but
herself
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
have
warn
me
before
to
mention
them
as
little
as
possible
to
HER
,
for
people
do
not
like
to
be
tell
of
their
child
's
fault
,
and
so
I
conclude
I
be
to
keep
silence
on
them
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
about
half
-
past
nine
,
Mrs.
Bloomfield
invite
me
to
partake
of
a
frugal
supper
of
cold
meat
and
bread
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
when
that
be
over
,
and
she
take
her
bedroom
candlestick
and
retire
to
rest
;
for
though
I
wish
to
be
pleased
with
her
,
her
company
be
extremely
irksome
to
me
;
and
I
could
not
help
feel
that
she
be
cold
,
grave
,
and
forbid
 
the
very
opposite
of
the
kind
<EOS>
,
warm
-
hearted
matron
my
hope
have
depict
her
to
be
.
    
<EOS>
a
FEW
<EOS>
MORE
lesson
  
<EOS>
I
rise
next
morning
with
a
feeling
of
hopeful
exhilaration
,
in
spite
of
the
disappointment
already
experience
;
but
I
find
the
dressing
of
Mary
Ann
be
no
light
matter
,
as
her
abundant
hair
be
to
be
smear
with
pomade
,
plait
in
three
long
tail
,
and
tie
with
bow
of
ribbon
:
 
a
task
my
unaccustomed
finger
find
great
difficulty
in
perform
.
 
<EOS>
She
tell
me
her
nurse
could
do
it
in
half
the
time
,
and
,
by
keep
up
a
constant
fidget
of
impatience
,
contrive
to
render
me
still
longer
.
 
<EOS>
when
all
be
do
,
we
go
into
the
schoolroom
,
where
I
meet
my
other
pupil
,
and
chat
with
the
two
till
it
be
time
to
go
down
to
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
that
meal
be
conclude
,
and
a
few
civil
word
have
be
exchange
with
Mrs.
Bloomfield
,
we
repair
to
the
schoolroom
again
,
and
commence
the
business
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
my
pupil
very
backward
,
indeed
;
but
Tom
,
though
averse
to
every
species
of
mental
exertion
,
be
not
without
ability
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
Ann
could
scarcely
read
a
word
,
and
be
so
careless
and
inattentive
that
I
could
hardly
get
on
with
her
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
by
dint
of
great
labour
and
patience
,
I
manage
to
get
something
do
in
the
course
of
the
morning
,
and
then
accompany
my
young
charge
out
into
the
garden
and
adjacent
ground
,
for
a
little
recreation
before
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
there
we
get
along
tolerably
together
,
except
that
I
find
they
have
no
notion
of
go
with
me
:
 
<EOS>
I
must
go
with
them
,
wherever
they
choose
to
lead
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
run
,
walk
,
or
stand
,
exactly
as
it
suit
their
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
I
think
,
be
reverse
the
order
of
thing
;
and
I
find
it
doubly
disagreeable
,
as
on
this
as
well
as
subsequent
occasion
,
they
seem
to
prefer
the
dirty
place
and
the
most
dismal
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
remedy
;
either
I
must
follow
them
,
or
keep
entirely
apart
from
them
,
and
thus
appear
neglectful
of
my
charge
.
 
<EOS>
to
-
day
,
they
manifest
a
particular
attachment
to
a
well
at
the
bottom
of
the
lawn
,
where
they
persist
in
dabble
with
stick
and
pebble
for
above
half
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
constant
fear
that
their
mother
would
see
them
from
the
window
,
and
blame
me
for
allow
them
thus
to
draggle
their
clothe
and
wet
their
foot
and
hand
,
instead
of
take
exercise
;
but
no
argument
,
command
,
or
entreaty
could
draw
them
away
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
do
not
see
them
,
some
one
else
do
 
<EOS>
a
gentleman
on
horseback
have
enter
the
gate
and
be
proceed
up
the
road
;
at
the
distance
of
a
few
pace
from
us
he
pause
,
and
call
to
the
child
in
a
waspish
penetrating
tone
,
bade
them
"
keep
out
of
that
water
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Grey
,
"
say
he
,
"
(
I
suppose
it
be
Miss
Grey
)
,
I
be
surprised
that
you
should
allow
them
to
dirty
their
clothe
in
that
manner
!
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
see
how
Miss
Bloomfield
have
soil
her
frock
?
<EOS>
and
that
Master
Bloomfield
's
sock
be
quite
wet
?
<EOS>
and
both
of
them
without
glove
?
 
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
!
 
<EOS>
let
me
request
that
in
future
you
will
keep
them
decent
at
least
!
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
turn
away
,
and
continue
his
ride
up
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
this
be
Mr.
Bloomfield
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
that
he
should
nominate
his
child
Master
and
Miss
Bloomfield
;
and
still
more
so
,
that
he
should
speak
so
uncivilly
to
me
,
their
governess
,
and
a
perfect
stranger
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
presently
the
bell
ring
to
summon
us
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
the
child
at
one
,
while
he
and
his
lady
take
their
luncheon
at
the
same
table
.
 
<EOS>
His
conduct
there
do
not
greatly
raise
him
in
my
estimation
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
of
ordinary
stature
 
rather
below
than
above
 
and
rather
thin
than
stout
,
apparently
between
thirty
and
forty
year
of
age
:
 
<EOS>
he
have
a
large
mouth
,
pale
,
dingy
complexion
,
milky
blue
eye
,
and
hair
the
colour
of
a
hempen
cord
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
roast
leg
of
mutton
before
him
:
 
he
help
Mrs.
Bloomfield
,
the
child
,
and
me
,
desire
me
to
cut
up
the
child
's
meat
;
then
,
after
twist
about
the
mutton
in
various
direction
,
and
eye
it
from
different
point
,
he
pronounce
it
not
fit
to
be
eat
,
and
call
for
the
cold
beef
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
with
the
mutton
,
my
dear
?
"
ask
his
mate
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
quite
overdone
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
taste
,
Mrs.
Bloomfield
,
that
all
the
goodness
be
roast
out
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
and
can
not
you
see
that
all
that
nice
,
red
gravy
be
completely
dry
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
think
the
beef
will
suit
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
beef
be
set
before
him
,
and
he
begin
to
carve
,
but
with
the
most
rueful
expression
of
discontent
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
with
the
BEEF
,
Mr.
Bloomfield
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
think
it
be
very
nice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
it
be
very
nice
.
 
<EOS>
a
nice
joint
could
not
be
;
but
it
be
QUITE
spoil
,
"
reply
he
,
dolefully
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
so
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
do
not
you
see
how
it
be
cut
?
 
<EOS>
dear
 
dear
!
<EOS>
it
be
quite
shocking
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
must
have
cut
it
wrong
in
the
kitchen
,
then
,
for
I
be
sure
I
carve
it
quite
properly
here
,
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
doubt
they
cut
it
wrong
in
the
kitchen
 
<EOS>
the
savage
!
 
<EOS>
dear
 
dear
!
 
<EOS>
do
ever
any
one
see
such
a
fine
piece
of
beef
so
completely
ruin
?
 
<EOS>
but
remember
that
,
in
future
,
when
a
decent
dish
leave
this
table
,
they
shall
not
touch
it
in
the
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
remember
that
,
Mrs.
Bloomfield
!
"
  
<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
ruinous
state
of
the
beef
,
the
gentleman
manage
to
out
himself
some
delicate
slice
,
part
of
which
he
eat
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
next
speak
,
it
be
,
in
a
less
querulous
tone
,
to
ask
what
there
be
for
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Turkey
and
grouse
,
"
be
the
concise
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
besides
?
"
  
"
fish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
kind
of
fish
?
"
  
"
I
do
not
know

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
you
don't
KNOW
?
"
<EOS>
cry
he
,
look
solemnly
up
from
his
plate
,
and
suspend
his
knife
and
fork
in
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
the
cook
to
get
some
fish
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
particularize
what
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
that
beat
everything

<EOS>
a
lady
profess

keep
house

know
what
fish
be
for
dinner

<EOS>
profess
to
order
fish

do
not
specify
what
!

"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
Mr.
Bloomfield
,
you
will
order
dinner
yourself
in
future

"
  
<EOS>
nothing
more
be
say
;
and
I
be
very
glad
to
get
out
of
the
room
with
my
pupil
;
for
I
never
feel
so
ashamed
and
uncomfortable
in
my
life
for
anything
that
be
not
my
own
fault
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
we
apply
to
lesson
again
:
 
then
go
out
again
;
then
have
tea
in
the
schoolroom
;
then
I
dress
Mary
Ann
for
dessert
;
and
when
she
and
her
brother
have
go
down
to
the
dining
-
room
,
I
take
the
opportunity
of
begin
a
letter
to
my
dear
friend
at
home
:
 
but
the
child
come
up
before
I
have
half
complete
it
.
 
<EOS>
at
seven
I
have
to
put
Mary
Ann
to
bed
;
then
I
play
with
Tom
till
eight
,
when
he
,
too
,
go
;
and
I
finish
my
letter
and
unpack
my
clothe
,
which
I
have
hitherto
find
no
opportunity
for
do
,
and
,
finally
,
go
to
bed
myself
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
be
a
very
favourable
speciman
of
a
day
's
proceeding
.
  
<EOS>
My
task
of
instruction
and
surveillance
,
instead
of
become
easy
as
my
charge
<EOS>
and
I
get
better
accustomed
to
each
other
,
become
more
arduous
as
their
character
unfold
.
 
<EOS>
the
name
of
governess
,
I
soon
find
,
be
a
mere
mockery
as
apply
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
my
pupil
have
no
more
notion
of
obedience
than
a
wild
,
unbroken
colt
.
 
<EOS>
the
habitual
fear
of
their
father
's
peevish
temper
,
and
the
dread
of
the
punishment
he
be
will
not
to
inflict
when
irritated
,
keep
them
generally
within
bound
in
his
immediate
presence
.
 
<EOS>
the
girl
,
too
,
have
some
fear
of
their
mother
's
anger
;
and
the
boy
may
occasionally
be
bribe
to
do
as
she
bid
him
by
the
hope
of
reward
;
but
I
have
no
reward
to
offer
;
and
as
for
punishment
,
I
be
give
to
understand
,
the
parent
reserve
that
privilege
to
themselves
;
and
yet
they
expect
me
to
keep
my
pupil
in
order
.
 
<EOS>
other
child
may
be
guide
by
the
fear
of
anger
and
the
desire
of
approbation
;
but
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
have
any
effect
upon
these
.
  
<EOS>
Master
Tom
,
not
content
with
refuse
to
be
rule
<EOS>
,
must
needs
set
up
as
a
ruler
,
and
manifest
a
determination
to
keep
,
not
only
his
sister
,
but
his
governess
in
order
,
by
violent
manual
and
pedal
application
;
and
,
as
he
be
a
tall
,
strong
boy
of
his
year
,
this
occasion
no
trifling
inconvenience
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
sound
box
on
the
ear
,
on
such
occasion
,
may
have
settle
the
matter
easily
enough
:
 
but
as
,
in
that
case
,
he
may
make
up
some
story
to
his
mother
which
she
would
be
sure
to
believe
,
as
she
have
such
unshaken
faith
in
his
veracity
 
though
I
have
already
discover
it
to
be
by
no
means
<EOS>
unimpeachable
 
<EOS>
I
determine
to
refrain
from
strike
him
,
even
in
self
-
defence
;
and
,
in
his
most
violent
mood
,
my
only
resource
be
to
throw
him
on
his
back
and
hold
his
hand
and
foot
till
the
frenzy
be
somewhat
abate
.
 
<EOS>
to
the
difficulty
of
prevent
him
from
do
what
he
ought
not
,
be
add
that
of
force
him
to
do
what
he
ought
.
 
<EOS>
often
he
would
positively
refuse
to
learn
,
or
to
repeat
his
lesson
,
or
even
to
look
at
his
book
.
<EOS>
here
,
again
,
a
good
birch
rod
may
have
be
serviceable
;
but
,
as
my
power
be
so
limited
,
I
must
make
the
good
use
of
what
I
have
.
  
<EOS>
as
there
be
no
settle
hour
for
study
and
play
,
I
resolve
to
give
my
pupil
a
certain
task
,
which
,
with
moderate
attention
,
they
could
perform
in
a
short
time
;
and
till
this
be
do
,
however
weary
I
be
,
or
however
perverse
they
may
be
,
nothing
short
of
parental
interference
should
induce
me
to
suffer
them
to
leave
the
schoolroom
,
even
if
I
should
sit
with
my
chair
against
the
door
to
keep
them
in
.
 
<EOS>
Patience
,
Firmness
,
and
Perseverance
be
my
only
weapon
;
and
these
I
resolve
to
use
to
the
utmost
.
 
<EOS>
I
determine
always
strictly
to
fulfil
the
threat
and
promise
I
make
;
and
,
to
that
end
,
I
must
be
cautious
to
threaten
and
promise
nothing
that
I
could
not
perform
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
I
would
carefully
refrain
from
all
useless
irritability
and
indulgence
of
my
own
ill
-
temper
:
 
when
they
behave
tolerably
,
I
would
be
as
kind
and
obliging
as
it
be
in
my
power
to
be
,
in
order
to
make
the
wide
possible
distinction
between
good
and
bad
conduct
;
I
would
reason
with
them
,
too
,
in
the
simple
and
most
effective
manner
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
reprove
them
,
or
refuse
to
gratify
their
wish
,
after
a
glaring
fault
,
it
should
be
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
:
 
their
little
hymn
and
prayer
I
would
make
plain
and
clear
to
their
understanding
;
when
they
say
their
prayer
at
night
and
ask
pardon
for
their
offence
,
I
would
remind
them
of
the
sin
of
the
past
day
,
solemnly
,
but
in
perfect
kindness
,
to
avoid
raise
a
spirit
of
opposition
;
penitential
hymn
should
be
say
by
the
naughty
,
cheerful
one
by
the
comparatively
good
;
and
every
kind
of
instruction
I
would
convey
to
them
,
as
much
as
possible
,
by
entertain
discourse
 
apparently
with
no
other
object
than
their
present
amusement
in
view
.
  
<EOS>
by
these
mean
I
hope
in
time
both
to
benefit
the
child
and
to
gain
the
approbation
of
their
parent
;
and
also
to
convince
my
friend
at
home
that
I
be
not
so
want
in
skill
and
prudence
as
they
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
difficulty
I
have
to
contend
with
be
great
;
but
I
know
(
at
least
I
believe
)
unremitte
patience
and
perseverance
could
overcome
them
;
and
night
and
morning
I
implore
Divine
assistance
to
this
end
.
 
<EOS>
but
either
the
child
be
so
incorrigible
,
the
parent
so
unreasonable
,
or
myself
so
mistaken
in
my
view
,
or
so
unable
to
carry
them
out
,
that
my
good
intention
and
most
strenuous
effort
seem
productive
of
no
well
result
than
sport
to
the
child
,
dissatisfaction
to
their
parent
,
and
torment
to
myself
.
  
<EOS>
the
task
of
instruction
be
as
arduous
for
the
body
as
the
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
to
run
after
my
pupil
to
catch
them
,
to
carry
or
drag
them
to
the
table
,
and
often
forcibly
to
hold
them
there
till
the
lesson
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
I
frequently
put
into
a
corner
,
seat
myself
before
him
in
a
chair
,
with
a
book
which
contain
the
little
task
that
must
be
say
or
read
,
before
he
be
release
,
in
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
strong
enough
to
push
both
me
and
the
chair
away
,
so
he
would
stand
twist
his
body
and
face
into
the
most
grotesque
and
singular
contortion
 
laughable
,
no
doubt
,
to
an
unconcerned
spectator
,
but
not
to
me
 
and
utter
loud
yell
and
doleful
outcry
,
intend
to
represent
weeping
but
wholly
without
the
accompaniment
of
tear
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
this
be
do
solely
for
the
purpose
of
annoy
me
;
and
,
therefore
,
however
I
may
inwardly
tremble
with
impatience
and
irritation
<EOS>
,
I
manfully
strove
to
suppress
all
visible
sign
of
molestation
,
and
affect
to
sit
with
calm
indifference
,
wait
till
it
should
please
him
to
cease
this
pastime
,
and
prepare
for
a
run
in
the
garden
,
by
cast
his
eye
on
the
book
and
reading
or
repeat
the
few
word
he
be
require
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
he
be
determined
to
do
his
writing
badly
;
and
I
have
to
hold
his
hand
to
prevent
him
from
purposely
blot
or
disfigure
the
paper
.
 
<EOS>
frequently
I
threaten
that
,
if
he
do
not
do
better
,
he
should
have
another
line
:
 
<EOS>
then
he
would
stubbornly
refuse
to
write
this
line
;
and
I
,
to
save
my
word
,
have
finally
to
resort
to
the
expedient
of
hold
his
finger
upon
the
pen
,
and
forcibly
draw
his
hand
up
and
down
,
till
,
in
spite
of
his
resistance
,
the
line
be
in
some
sort
complete
.
  
<EOS>
yet
Tom
be
by
no
means
the
most
unmanageable
of
my
pupil
:
<EOS>
sometimes
,
to
my
great
joy
,
he
would
have
the
sense
to
see
that
his
wise
policy
be
to
finish
his
task
,
and
go
out
and
amuse
himself
till
I
and
his
sister
come
to
join
him
;
which
frequently
be
not
at
all
,
for
Mary
Ann
<EOS>
seldom
follow
his
example
in
this
particular
:
 
<EOS>
she
apparently
prefer
rolling
on
the
floor
to
any
other
amusement
:
 
down
<EOS>
she
would
drop
like
a
leaden
weight
;
and
when
I
,
with
great
difficulty
,
have
succeed
in
root
her
thence
,
I
have
still
to
hold
her
up
with
one
arm
,
while
with
the
other
I
hold
the
book
from
which
she
be
to
read
or
spell
her
lesson
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
dead
weight
of
the
big
girl
of
six
become
too
heavy
for
one
arm
to
bear
,
I
transfer
it
to
the
other
;
or
,
if
both
be
weary
of
the
burden
,
I
carry
her
into
a
corner
,
and
tell
her
she
may
come
out
when
she
should
find
the
use
of
her
foot
,
and
stand
up
:
<EOS>
but
she
generally
prefer
lie
there
like
a
log
till
dinner
or
tea
-
time
,
when
,
as
I
could
not
deprive
her
of
her
meal
,
she
must
be
liberate
,
and
would
come
crawl
out
with
a
grin
of
triumph
on
her
round
,
red
face
.
 
<EOS>
often
she
would
stubbornly
refuse
to
pronounce
some
particular
word
in
her
lesson
;
and
now
I
regret
the
lose
labour
I
have
have
in
strive
to
conquer
her
obstinacy
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
pass
it
over
as
a
matter
of
no
consequence
,
it
would
have
be
well
for
both
party
,
than
vainly
strive
to
overcome
it
as
I
do
;
but
I
think
it
my
absolute
duty
to
crush
this
vicious
tendency
in
the
bud
:
 
<EOS>
and
so
it
be
,
if
I
could
have
do
it
;
and
have
my
power
be
less
limited
<EOS>
,
I
may
have
enforce
obedience
;
but
,
as
it
be
,
it
be
a
trial
of
strength
between
her
and
me
,
in
which
she
generally
come
off
victorious
;
and
every
victory
serve
to
encourage
and
strengthen
her
for
a
future
contest
.
 
<EOS>
in
vain
I
argue
,
coax
,
entreat
,
threaten
,
scold
;
in
vain
I
keep
her
in
from
play
,
or
,
if
oblige
to
take
her
out
,
refuse
to
play
with
her
,
or
to
speak
kindly
or
have
anything
to
do
with
her
;
in
vain
I
try
to
set
before
her
the
advantage
of
do
as
she
be
bid
,
and
be
love
,
and
kindly
treat
in
consequence
,
and
the
disadvantage
of
persist
in
her
absurd
perversity
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
when
she
would
ask
me
to
do
something
for
her
,
I
would
answer
,
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
I
will
,
Mary
Ann
,
if
you
will
only
say
that
word
.
 
<EOS>
come
!
<EOS>
you
would
better
say
it
at
once
,
and
have
no
more
trouble
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
of
course
,
I
can
do
nothing
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
me
,
at
her
age
,
or
under
,
neglect
and
disgrace
be
the
most
dreadful
of
punishment
;
but
on
her
they
make
no
impression
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
exasperate
to
the
utmost
pitch
,
I
would
shake
her
violently
by
the
shoulder
,
or
pull
her
long
hair
,
or
put
her
in
the
corner
;
for
which
she
punish
me
with
loud
,
shrill
,
pierce
scream
,
that
go
through
my
head
like
a
knife
.
 
<EOS>
She
know
I
hate
this
,
and
when
she
have
shriek
her
utmost
,
would
look
into
my
face
with
an
air
of
vindictive
satisfaction
,
exclaim
,
 
"
<EOS>
now
,
then
!
<EOS>
that
be
for
you
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
shriek
again
and
again
,
till
I
be
force
to
stop
my
ear
.
 
<EOS>
often
these
dreadful
cry
would
bring
Mrs.
Bloomfield
up
to
inquire
<EOS>
what
be
the
matter
?
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
Ann
be
a
naughty
girl
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
be
these
shocking
scream
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
scream
in
a
passion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
hear
such
a
dreadful
noise
!
 
<EOS>
You
may
be
kill
her
.
<EOS>
why
be
she
not
out
with
her
brother
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
get
her
to
finish
her
lesson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
Mary
Ann
must
be
a
good
girl
,
and
finish
her
lesson
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
blandly
speak
to
the
child
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
hope
I
shall
never
hear
such
terrible
cry
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
and
fix
her
cold
,
stony
eye
upon
me
with
a
look
that
could
not
be
mistaken
,
she
would
shut
the
door
,
and
walk
away
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
I
would
try
to
take
the
little
obstinate
creature
by
surprise
,
and
casually
ask
her
the
word
while
she
be
think
of
something
else
;
frequently
she
would
begin
to
say
it
,
and
then
suddenly
cheek
herself
,
with
a
provoking
look
that
seem
to
say
,
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
I
be
too
sharp
for
you
;
you
shall
not
trick
it
out
of
me
,
either
.
"
  
<EOS>
on
another
occasion
,
I
pretend
to
forget
the
whole
affair
;
and
talk
and
play
with
her
as
usual
,
till
night
,
when
I
put
her
to
bed
;
then
bend
over
her
,
while
she
lie
all
smile
and
good
humour
,
just
before
depart
,
I
say
,
as
cheerfully
and
kindly
as
before
"
now
,
Mary
Ann
,
just
tell
me
that
word
before
I
kiss
you
good
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
a
good
girl
now
,
and
,
of
course
,
you
will
say
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
will
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
I
can
not
kiss
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
do
not
care
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
vain
I
express
my
sorrow
;
in
vain
I
linger
for
some
symptom
of
contrition
;
she
really
"
do
not
care
,
"
and
I
leave
her
alone
,
and
in
darkness
,
wonder
most
of
all
at
this
last
proof
of
insensate
stubbornness
.
 
<EOS>
in
my
childhood
I
could
not
imagine
a
more
afflictive
punishment
than
for
my
mother
to
refuse
to
kiss
me
at
night
:
 
<EOS>
the
very
idea
be
terrible
.
 
<EOS>
More
than
the
idea
I
never
feel
,
for
,
happily
,
I
never
commit
a
fault
that
be
deem
worthy
of
such
penalty
;
but
once
I
remember
,
for
some
transgression
of
my
sister
's
,
our
mother
think
proper
to
inflict
it
upon
her
:
what
she
feel
,
I
can
not
tell
;
but
my
sympathetic
tear
and
suffer
for
her
sake
<EOS>
I
shall
not
soon
forget
.
  
<EOS>
another
troublesome
trait
in
Mary
Ann
be
her
incorrigible
propensity
to
keep
run
into
the
nursery
,
to
play
with
her
little
sister
and
the
nurse
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
natural
enough
,
but
,
as
it
be
against
her
mother
's
express
desire
,
I
,
of
course
,
forbid
her
to
do
so
,
and
do
my
utmost
to
keep
her
with
me
;
but
that
only
increase
her
relish
for
the
nursery
,
and
the
more
I
strove
to
keep
her
out
of
it
,
the
oftener
she
go
,
and
the
longer
she
stay
,
to
the
great
dissatisfaction
of
Mrs.
Bloomfield
,
who
,
I
well
know
,
would
impute
all
the
blame
of
the
matter
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
another
of
my
trial
be
the
dressing
in
the
morning
:
 
at
one
time
she
would
not
be
wash
;
at
another
she
would
not
be
dress
,
unless
she
may
wear
some
particular
frock
,
that
I
know
her
mother
would
not
like
her
to
have
;
at
another
she
would
scream
and
run
away
if
I
attempt
to
touch
her
hair
.
 
<EOS>
so
that
,
frequently
,
when
,
after
much
trouble
and
toil
,
I
have
,
at
length
,
succeed
in
bring
her
down
,
the
breakfast
be
nearly
half
over
;
and
black
look
from
"
mamma
,
"
and
testy
observation
from
"
papa
,
"
speak
at
me
,
if
not
to
me
,
be
sure
to
be
my
meed
:
 
for
few
thing
irritate
the
latter
so
much
as
want
of
punctuality
at
meal
time
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
among
the
minor
annoyance
,
be
my
inability
to
satisfy
Mrs.
Bloomfield
with
her
daughter
's
dress
;
and
the
child
's
hair
"
be
never
fit
to
be
see
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
sometimes
,
as
a
powerful
reproach
to
me
,
she
would
perform
the
office
of
tire
woman
herself
,
and
then
complain
bitterly
of
the
trouble
it
give
her
.
  
<EOS>
when
little
Fanny
come
into
the
schoolroom
,
I
hope
she
would
be
mild
and
inoffensive
,
at
least
;
but
a
few
day
,
if
not
a
few
hour
,
suffice
to
destroy
the
illusion
:
 
<EOS>
I
find
her
a
mischievous
,
intractable
little
creature
,
give
up
to
falsehood
and
deception
,
<EOS>
young
as
she
be
,
and
alarmingly
fond
of
exercise
her
two
favourite
weapon
of
offence
and
defence
:
 
<EOS>
that
of
spit
in
the
face
of
those
who
incur
her
displeasure
,
and
bellowing
like
a
bull
when
her
unreasonable
desire
be
not
gratify
.
 
<EOS>
as
she
,
generally
,
be
pretty
quiet
in
her
parent
'
presence
,
and
they
be
impressed
with
the
notion
of
her
be
a
remarkably
gentle
child
,
her
falsehood
be
readily
believe
,
and
her
loud
uproar
lead
them
to
suspect
harsh
and
injudicious
treatment
on
my
part
;
and
when
,
at
length
,
her
bad
disposition
become
manifest
even
to
their
prejudiced
eye
<EOS>
,
I
feel
that
the
whole
be
attribute
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
naughty
girl
Fanny
be
get
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bloomfield
would
say
to
her
spouse
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
observe
,
my
dear
,
how
she
be
alter
since
she
enter
the
schoolroom
?
 
<EOS>
She
will
soon
be
as
bad
as
the
other
two
;
and
,
I
be
sorry
to
say
,
they
have
quite
deteriorate
of
late
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
say
that
,
"
be
the
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
think
that
same
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
when
we
get
them
a
governess
they
would
improve
;
but
,
instead
of
that
,
they
get
bad
and
bad
:
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
it
be
with
their
learning
,
but
their
habit
,
I
know
,
make
no
sort
of
improvement
;
they
get
rough
,
and
dirty
,
and
more
unseemly
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
know
this
be
all
point
at
me
;
and
these
,
and
all
similar
innuendo
,
affect
me
far
more
deeply
than
any
open
accusation
would
have
do
;
for
against
the
latter
I
should
have
be
rouse
to
speak
in
my
own
defence
:
 
<EOS>
now
I
judge
it
my
wise
plan
to
subdue
every
resentful
impulse
,
suppress
every
sensitive
shrinking
,
and
go
on
perseveringly
,
do
my
good
;
for
,
irksome
as
my
situation
be
,
I
earnestly
wish
to
retain
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
if
I
could
struggle
on
with
unremitte
firmness
and
integrity
,
the
child
would
in
time
become
more
humanized
:
 
every
month
would
contribute
to
make
them
some
little
wise
,
and
,
consequently
,
more
manageable
;
for
a
child
of
nine
or
ten
as
frantic
and
ungovernable
as
these
at
six
and
seven
would
be
a
maniac
.
  
<EOS>
I
flatter
myself
I
be
benefit
my
parent
and
sister
by
my
continuance
here
;
for
small
as
the
salary
be
,
I
still
be
earn
something
,
and
with
strict
economy
I
could
easily
manage
to
have
something
to
spare
for
them
,
if
they
would
favour
me
by
take
it
.
<EOS>
then
it
be
by
my
own
will
that
I
have
get
the
place
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
bring
all
this
tribulation
on
myself
,
and
I
be
determined
to
bear
it
;
<EOS>
nay
,
more
than
that
,
I
do
not
even
regret
the
step
I
have
take
.
 
<EOS>
I
long
to
show
my
friend
that
,
even
now
,
I
be
competent
to
undertake
the
charge
,
and
able
to
acquit
myself
honourably
to
the
end
;
and
if
ever
I
feel
it
degrade
to
submit
so
quietly
,
or
intolerable
to
toil
so
constantly
<EOS>
,
I
would
turn
towards
my
home
,
and
say
within
myself
     
They
may
crush
,
but
they
shall
not
subdue
me
!
'
<EOS>
Tis
of
thee
that
I
think
,
not
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
about
Christmas
<EOS>
I
be
allow
to
visit
home
;
but
my
holiday
be
only
of
a
fortnight
's
duration
:
 
"
<EOS>
for
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bloomfield
,
"
I
think
,
as
you
have
see
your
friend
so
lately
,
you
would
not
care
for
a
long
stay
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
leave
her
to
think
<EOS>
so
still
:
 
<EOS>
but
she
little
know
how
long
,
how
wearisome
those
fourteen
week
of
absence
have
be
to
me
;
how
intensely
I
have
long
for
my
holiday
,
how
greatly
I
be
disappointed
at
their
curtailment
.
 
<EOS>
yet
she
be
not
to
blame
in
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
tell
her
my
feeling
,
and
she
could
not
be
expect
to
divine
them
;
I
have
not
be
with
her
a
full
term
,
and
she
be
justify
in
not
allow
me
a
full
vacation
.
    
<EOS>
the
GRANDMAMMA
  
<EOS>
I
spare
my
reader
the
account
of
my
delight
on
come
home
,
my
happiness
while
there
 
enjoy
a
brief
space
of
rest
and
liberty
in
that
dear
,
familiar
place
,
among
the
loving
and
the
loved
 
and
my
sorrow
on
be
oblige
to
bid
them
,
once
more
,
a
long
adieu
.
  
<EOS>
I
return
,
however
,
with
unabated
vigour
to
my
work
 
a
more
arduous
task
than
anyone
can
imagine
,
who
have
not
feel
something
like
the
misery
of
be
charge
with
the
care
and
direction
of
a
set
of
mischievous
,
turbulent
rebel
,
whom
his
utmost
exertion
can
not
bind
to
their
duty
;
while
,
at
the
same
time
,
he
be
responsible
for
their
conduct
to
a
high
power
,
who
exact
from
him
what
can
not
be
achieve
without
the
aid
of
the
superior
's
more
potent
authority
;
which
,
either
from
indolence
,
or
the
fear
of
become
unpopular
with
the
said
rebellious
gang
,
the
latter
refuse
to
give
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
conceive
few
situation
more
harass
than
that
wherein
,
however
you
may
long
for
success
,
however
you
may
labour
to
fulfil
your
duty
,
your
effort
be
baffle
and
set
at
nought
by
those
beneath
you
,
and
unjustly
censure
and
misjudge
by
those
above
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
enumerate
half
the
vexatious
propensity
of
my
pupil
,
or
half
the
trouble
result
from
my
heavy
responsibility
,
for
fear
of
trespass
too
much
upon
the
reader
's
patience
;
as
,
perhaps
,
I
have
already
do
;
but
my
design
in
write
the
few
last
page
be
not
to
amuse
,
but
to
benefit
those
whom
it
may
concern
;
he
that
have
no
interest
in
such
matter
will
doubtless
have
skip
them
over
with
a
cursory
glance
,
and
,
perhaps
,
a
malediction
against
the
prolixity
of
the
writer
;
but
if
a
parent
have
,
therefrom
,
gather
any
useful
hint
,
or
an
unfortunate
governess
receive
thereby
the
slight
benefit
,
I
be
well
reward
for
my
pain
.
  
<EOS>
to
avoid
trouble
and
confusion
,
I
have
take
my
pupil
one
by
one
,
and
discuss
their
various
quality
;
but
this
can
give
no
adequate
idea
of
be
worry
by
the
whole
three
together
;
when
,
as
be
often
the
case
,
all
be
determined
to
"
be
naughty
,
and
to
tease
Miss
Grey
,
and
put
her
in
a
passion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
sometimes
,
on
such
occasion
,
the
thought
have
suddenly
occur
to
me
 
"
if
they
could
see
me
now
!
"
<EOS>
meaning
,
of
course
,
my
friend
at
home
;
and
the
idea
of
how
they
would
pity
me
have
make
me
pity
myself
 
so
greatly
that
I
have
have
the
utmost
difficulty
to
restrain
my
tear
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
restrain
them
,
till
my
little
tormentor
be
go
to
dessert
,
or
clear
off
to
bed
(
my
only
prospect
of
deliverance
)
,
and
then
,
in
all
the
bliss
of
solitude
,
I
have
give
myself
up
to
the
luxury
of
an
unrestricted
burst
of
weeping
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
a
weakness
I
do
not
often
indulge
:
 
<EOS>
my
employment
be
too
numerous
,
my
leisure
moment
too
precious
,
to
admit
of
much
time
be
give
to
fruitless
lamentation
.
  
<EOS>
I
particularly
remember
one
wild
,
snowy
afternoon
,
soon
after
my
return
in
January
:
 
the
child
have
all
come
up
from
dinner
,
loudly
declare
that
they
mean
"
to
be
naughty
;
"
and
they
have
well
keep
their
resolution
,
though
I
have
talk
myself
hoarse
,
and
weary
every
muscle
in
my
throat
,
in
the
vain
attempt
to
reason
them
out
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
get
Tom
pin
up
in
a
corner
,
whence
<EOS>
,
I
tell
him
,
he
should
not
escape
till
he
have
do
his
appoint
task
.
<EOS>
meantime
,
Fanny
have
possess
herself
of
my
work
-
bag
,
and
be
rifle
its
content
 
and
spit
into
it
besides
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
to
let
it
alone
,
but
to
no
purpose
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
"
burn
it
,
Fanny
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Tom
:
 
and
this
command
she
hasten
to
obey
.
 
<EOS>
I
spring
to
snatch
it
from
the
fire
,
and
Tom
dart
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mary
Ann
,
throw
her
desk
out
of
the
window
!
"
<EOS>
cry
he
:
 
and
my
precious
desk
,
contain
my
letter
and
paper
,
my
small
amount
of
cash
,
and
all
my
valuable
,
be
about
to
be
precipitate
from
the
three
-
storey
window
.
 
<EOS>
I
fly
to
rescue
it
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
Tom
have
leave
the
room
,
and
be
rush
down
the
stair
,
follow
by
Fanny
.
 
<EOS>
have
secure
my
desk
,
I
run
to
catch
them
,
and
Mary
Ann
come
scamper
after
.
 
<EOS>
all
three
escape
me
,
and
run
out
of
the
house
into
the
garden
,
where
they
plunge
about
in
the
snow
,
shout
and
scream
in
exultant
glee
.
  
<EOS>
what
must
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
if
I
follow
them
,
I
should
probably
be
unable
to
capture
one
,
and
only
drive
them
farther
away
;
if
I
do
not
,
how
be
I
to
get
them
in
?
 
<EOS>
and
what
would
their
parent
think
of
me
,
if
they
see
or
hear
the
child
riot
,
hatless
,
bonnetless
,
gloveless
,
and
bootless
,
in
the
deep
soft
snow
?
 
<EOS>
while
I
stand
in
this
perplexity
,
just
without
the
door
,
try
,
by
grim
look
and
angry
word
,
to
awe
them
into
subjection

I
hear
a
voice
behind
me
,
in
harshly
pierce
tone
,
exclaim
,
     
"
Miss
Grey

nearer

you

to
this
effect
(
for
I
could
only
distinguish
the
most
emphatic
word
)
     
"
Gracious
heaven
!
 
<EOS>
never
in
all
my
life
!
 
<EOS>
get
their
death
as
sure
as
!
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
,
my
dear
,
she
be
a
PROPER
person
?
 
<EOS>
take
my
word
for
it
"
  
<EOS>
I
hear
no
more
;
but
that
suffice
.
  
<EOS>
the
senior
Mrs.
Bloomfield
have
be
very
attentive
and
civil
to
me
;
and
till
now
I
have
think
her
a
nice
,
kind
-
hearted
,
chatty
old
body
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
often
come
to
me
and
talk
in
a
confidential
strain
;
nodding
and
shake
her
head
,
and
gesticulate
with
hand
and
eye
,
as
a
certain
class
of
old
lady
be
will
not
to
do
;
though
I
never
know
one
that
carry
the
peculiarity
to
so
great
an
extent
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
even
sympathise
with
me
for
the
trouble
I
have
with
the
child
,
and
express
at
time
,
by
half
sentence
,
intersperse
with
nod
and
know
winks
,
her
sense
of
the
injudicious
conduct
of
their
mamma
in
so
restrict
my
power
,
and
neglect
to
support
me
with
her
authority
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
mode
of
testify
disapprobation
be
not
much
to
my
taste
;
and
I
generally
refuse
to
take
it
in
,
or
understand
anything
more
than
be
openly
speak
;
at
least
,
I
never
go
farther
than
an
implied
acknowledgment
that
,
if
matter
be
otherwise
order
my
task
would
be
a
less
difficult
one
,
and
I
should
be
better
able
to
guide
and
instruct
my
charge
;
but
now
I
must
be
doubly
cautious
.
<EOS>
hitherto
,
though
I
see
the
old
lady
have
her
defect
(
of
which
one
be
a
proneness
to
proclaim
her
perfection
)
,
I
have
always
be
wishful
to
excuse
them
,
and
to
give
her
credit
for
all
the
virtue
she
profess
,
and
even
imagine
other
yet
untold
.
 
<EOS>
Kindness
,
which
have
be
the
food
of
my
life
through
so
many
year
,
have
lately
be
so
entirely
deny
me
,
that
I
welcome
with
grateful
joy
the
slight
semblance
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
no
wonder
,
then
,
that
my
heart
warm
to
the
old
lady
,
and
always
gladden
at
her
approach
and
regret
her
departure
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
,
the
few
word
luckily
or
unluckily
hear
in
pass
<EOS>
have
wholly
revolutionize
my
idea
respect
her
:
 
<EOS>
now
I
look
upon
her
as
hypocritical
and
insincere
,
a
flatterer
,
and
a
spy
upon
my
word
and
deed
.
 
<EOS>
Doubtless
it
would
have
be
my
interest
still
to
meet
her
with
the
same
cheerful
smile
and
tone
of
respectful
cordiality
as
before
;
but
I
could
not
,
if
I
would
:
 
my
manner
alter
with
my
feeling
,
and
become
so
cold
and
shy
that
she
could
not
fail
to
notice
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
soon
do
notice
it
,
and
HER
manner
alter
too
:
 
the
familiar
nod
be
change
to
a
stiff
bow
,
the
gracious
smile
give
place
to
a
glare
of
Gorgon
ferocity
;
her
vivacious
loquacity
be
entirely
transfer
from
me
to
"
the
darling
boy
and
girl
,
"
whom
she
flatter
and
indulge
more
absurdly
than
ever
their
mother
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
I
confess
I
be
somewhat
troubled
at
this
change
:
 
<EOS>
I
fear
the
consequence
of
her
displeasure
,
and
even
make
some
effort
to
recover
the
ground
I
have
lose
 
and
with
well
apparent
success
than
I
could
have
anticipate
.
 
<EOS>
at
one
time
,
I
,
merely
in
common
civility
,
ask
after
her
cough
;
immediately
her
long
visage
relax
into
a
smile
,
and
she
favour
me
with
a
particular
history
of
that
and
her
other
infirmity
,
follow
by
an
account
of
her
pious
resignation
,
deliver
in
the
usual
emphatic
,
declamatory
style
,
which
no
writing
can
portray
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
there
be
one
remedy
for
all
,
my
dear
,
and
that
be
resignation
"
(
a
toss
of
the
head
)
,
<EOS>
"
resignation
to
the
will
of
heaven
!
"
<EOS>
(
an
uplifting
of
the
hand
and
eye
)
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
have
always
support
me
through
all
my
trial
,
and
always
will
do
"
(
a
succession
of
nod
)
.
<EOS>
"
but
then
,
it
be
not
everybody
that
can
say
that
"
(
a
shake
of
the
head
)
;
"
but
I
be
one
of
the
pious
one
,
Miss
Grey
!
"
<EOS>
(
a
very
significant
nod
and
toss
)
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
,
thank
heaven
,
I
always
be
"
(
another
nod
)
,
"
and
I
glory
in
it
!
"
<EOS>
(
an
emphatic
clasping
of
the
hand
and
shaking
of
the
head
)
.
 
<EOS>
and
with
several
text
of
scripture
,
misquote
or
misapplied
,
and
religious
exclamation
so
redolent
of
the
ludicrous
in
the
style
of
delivery
and
manner
of
bring
in
,
if
not
in
the
expression
themselves
,
that
I
decline
repeat
them
,
she
withdraw
;
toss
her
large
head
in
high
good
-
humour
 
with
herself
at
least
 
and
leave
me
hope
that
,
after
all
,
she
be
rather
weak
than
wicked
.
  
<EOS>
at
her
next
visit
to
Wellwood
House
,
I
go
so
far
as
to
say
I
be
glad
to
see
her
look
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
the
effect
of
this
be
magical
:
the
word
,
intend
as
a
mark
of
civility
,
be
receive
as
a
flattering
compliment
;
her
countenance
brighten
up
,
and
from
that
moment
she
become
as
gracious
and
benign
as
heart
could
wish
 
in
outward
semblance
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
from
what
I
now
see
of
her
,
and
what
I
hear
from
the
child
,
I
know
that
,
in
order
to
gain
her
cordial
friendship
,
I
have
but
to
utter
a
word
of
flattery
at
each
convenient
opportunity
:
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
against
my
principle
;
and
for
lack
of
this
,
the
capricious
old
dame
soon
deprive
me
of
her
favour
again
,
and
<EOS>
I
believe
do
me
much
secret
injury
.
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
greatly
influence
her
daughter
-
in
-
law
against
me
,
because
,
between
that
lady
and
herself
there
be
a
mutual
dislike
 
chiefly
show
by
her
in
secret
detraction
and
calumniation
;
by
the
other
,
in
an
excess
of
frigid
formality
in
her
demeanour
;
and
no
fawning
flattery
of
the
elder
could
thaw
away
the
wall
of
ice
which
the
younger
interpose
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
but
with
her
son
,
the
old
lady
have
well
success
:
 
he
would
listen
to
all
she
have
to
say
,
provide
she
could
soothe
his
fretful
temper
,
and
refrain
from
irritate
him
by
her
own
asperity
;
and
I
have
reason
to
believe
that
she
considerably
strengthen
his
prejudice
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
tell
him
that
I
shamefully
neglect
the
child
,
and
even
his
wife
do
not
attend
to
them
as
she
ought
;
and
that
he
must
look
after
them
himself
,
or
they
would
all
go
to
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
thus
urge
,
he
would
frequently
give
himself
the
trouble
of
watch
them
from
the
window
during
their
play
;
at
time
,
he
would
follow
them
through
the
ground
,
and
too
often
come
suddenly
upon
them
while
they
be
dabble
in
the
forbidden
well
,
talk
to
the
coachman
in
the
stable
,
or
revelling
in
the
filth
of
the
farm
-
yard
 
<EOS>
and
I
,
meanwhile
,
wearily
stand
,
by
,
have
previously
exhaust
my
energy
in
vain
attempt
to
get
them
away
.
<EOS>
often
,
too
,
he
would
unexpectedly
pop
his
head
into
the
schoolroom
while
the
young
people
be
at
meal
,
and
find
them
spill
their
milk
over
the
table
and
themselves
,
plunge
their
finger
into
their
own
or
each
other
's
mug
,
or
quarrel
over
their
victual
like
a
set
of
tiger
's
cub
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
be
quiet
at
the
moment
,
I
be
connive
at
their
disorderly
conduct
;
if
(
as
be
frequently
the
case
)
I
happen
to
be
exalt
my
voice
to
enforce
order
,
I
be
use
undue
violence
,
and
set
the
girl
a
bad
example
by
such
ungentleness
of
tone
and
language
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
one
afternoon
in
spring
,
when
,
owe
to
the
rain
,
they
could
not
go
out
;
but
,
by
some
amazing
good
fortune
,
they
have
all
finish
their
lesson
,
and
yet
abstain
from
run
down
to
tease
their
parent
 
a
trick
that
annoy
me
greatly
,
but
which
,
on
rainy
day
,
I
seldom
could
prevent
their
doing
;
because
,
below
,
they
find
novelty
and
amusement
 
especially
when
visitor
be
in
the
house
;
and
their
mother
,
though
she
bid
me
keep
them
in
the
schoolroom
,
would
never
chide
them
for
leave
it
,
or
trouble
herself
to
send
them
back
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
day
they
appear
satisfied
with
,
their
present
abode
,
and
what
be
more
wonderful
still
,
seem
disposed
to
play
together
without
depend
on
me
for
amusement
,
and
without
quarrel
with
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
Their
occupation
be
a
somewhat
puzzle
one
:
 
<EOS>
they
be
all
squat
together
on
the
floor
by
the
window
,
over
a
heap
of
broken
toy
and
a
quantity
of
bird
'
egg
 
or
rather
egg
-
shell
,
for
the
content
have
luckily
be
abstract
.
 
<EOS>
these
shell
they
have
break
up
and
be
pound
into
small
fragment
,
to
what
end
I
could
not
imagine
;
but
so
long
as
they
be
quiet
and
not
in
positive
mischief
,
I
do
not
care
;
and
,
with
a
feeling
of
unusual
repose
,
I
sit
by
the
fire
,
put
the
finish
stitch
to
a
frock
for
Mary
Ann
's
doll
;
intending
,
when
that
be
do
,
to
begin
a
letter
to
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
the
door
open
,
and
the
dingy
head
of
Mr.
Bloomfield
look
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
all
very
quiet
here
!
 
<EOS>
what
be
you
do
?
"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
harm
to
-
DAY
,
at
least
,
"
think
i.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
of
a
different
opinion
.
<EOS>
advance
to
the
window
,
and
see
the
child
's
occupation
,
he
testily
exclaim
"
what
in
the
world
be
you
about
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
grind
egg
-
shell
,
papa
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Tom
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
dare
you
make
such
a
mess
,
you
little
devil
?
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
see
what
confound
work
you
be
make
of
the
carpet
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
(
the
carpet
be
a
plain
brown
drugget
)
.
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Grey
,
do
you
know
what
they
be
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
it

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
it

<EOS>
and
you
actually
sit
there
and
permit
them
to
go
on
without
a
word
of
reproof
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
they
be
do
any
harm

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
any
harm
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
look
there
!
 
<EOS>
just
look
at
that
carpet
,
and
see
 
be
there
ever
anything
like
it
in
a
christian
house
before
?
 
<EOS>
no
wonder
your
room
be
not
fit
for
a
pigsty
 
no
wonder
your
pupil
be
bad
than
a
litter
of
pig
!
 
<EOS>
no
wonder
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
declare
,
it
put
me
quite
past
my
patience
'
and
he
depart
,
shut
the
door
after
him
with
a
bang
that
make
the
child
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
put
me
quite
past
my
patience
too
!
"
<EOS>
mutter
I
,
get
up
;
and
,
seize
the
poker
,
I
dash
it
repeatedly
into
the
cinder
,
and
stir
them
up
with
unwonted
energy
;
thus
ease
my
irritation
under
pretence
of
mend
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
,
Mr.
Bloomfield
be
continually
look
in
to
see
if
the
schoolroom
be
in
order
;
and
,
as
the
child
be
continually
litter
the
floor
with
fragment
of
toy
,
stick
,
stone
,
stubble
,
leave
,
and
other
rubbish
,
which
I
could
not
prevent
their
bringing
,
or
oblige
them
to
gather
up
,
and
which
the
servant
refuse
to
"
clean
after
them
,
"
I
have
to
spend
a
considerable
portion
of
my
valuable
leisure
moment
on
my
knee
upon
the
floor
,
in
painsfully
reduce
thing
to
order
.
 
<EOS>
once
I
tell
them
that
they
should
not
taste
their
supper
till
they
have
pick
up
everything
from
the
carpet
;
Fanny
may
have
her
when
she
have
take
up
a
certain
quantity
,
Mary
Ann
when
she
have
gather
twice
as
many
,
and
Tom
be
to
clear
away
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
wonderful
to
state
,
the
girl
do
their
part
;
but
Tom
be
in
such
a
fury
that
he
fly
upon
the
table
,
scatter
the
bread
and
milk
about
the
floor
,
strike
his
sister
,
kick
the
coal
out
of
the
coal
-
pan
,
attempt
to
overthrow
the
table
and
chair
,
and
seem
inclined
to
make
a
Douglas
-
larder
of
the
whole
content
of
the
room
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
seize
upon
him
,
and
,
send
Mary
Ann
to
call
her
mamma
,
hold
him
,
in
spite
of
kick
,
blow
,
yell
,
and
execration
,
till
Mrs.
Bloomfield
make
her
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
with
my

"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
and
when
the
matter
be
explain
to
her
,
all
she
do
be
to
send
for
the
nursery

maid
to
put
the
room
in
order
,
and
bring
Master
Bloomfield
his
supper
.
  
<EOS>
"
there

"
cry
Tom
,
triumphantly
,
look
up
from
his
viand

his
mouth
almost

full

"
there

you

<EOS>
the
only
person
in
the

who
have
any
real
sympathy
for

be
the
nurse
;
for
she
have
suffer
like
affliction

in

She

me
afore
Christmas

how
it

if
I

again

I

<EOS>
I
know
not

for
Miss
Mary

her

"
    
<EOS>
the
uncle
  
<EOS>
besides
the
old
lady
,
there
be
another
relative
of
the
family
,
whose
visit
be
a
great
annoyance
to
me
 
<EOS>
this
be
"
Uncle
Robson
,
"
Mrs.
Bloomfield
's
brother
;
a
tall
,
self
-
sufficient
fellow
,
with
dark
hair
and
sallow
complexion
like
his
sister
,
a
nose
that
seem
to
disdain
the
earth
,
and
little
grey
eye
,
frequently
half
-
closed
,
with
a
mixture
of
real
stupidity
and
affect
contempt
of
all
surround
object
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
thick
-
set
,
strongly
-
build
man
,
but
he
have
find
some
mean
of
compress
his
waist
into
a
remarkably
small
compass
;
and
that
,
together
with
the
unnatural
stillness
of
his
form
,
show
that
the
lofty
-
minded
,
manly
Mr.
Robson
,
the
scorner
of
the
female
sex
,
be
not
above
the
foppery
of
stay
.
 
<EOS>
He
seldom
deign
to
notice
me
;
and
,
when
he
do
,
it
be
with
a
certain
supercilious
insolence
of
tone
and
manner
that
convince
me
he
be
no
gentleman
:
 
though
it
be
intend
to
have
a
contrary
effect
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
for
that
I
dislike
his
coming
,
so
much
as
for
the
harm
he
do
the
child
 
encourage
all
their
evil
propensity
,
and
undo
in
a
few
minute
the
little
good
<EOS>
it
have
take
me
month
of
labour
to
achieve
.
  
<EOS>
Fanny
and
little
Harriet
<EOS>
he
seldom
condescend
to
notice
;
but
Mary
Ann
be
something
of
a
favourite
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
continually
encourage
her
tendency
to
affectation
(
which
I
have
do
my
utmost
to
crush
)
,
talk
about
her
pretty
face
,
and
fill
her
head
with
all
manner
of
conceited
notion
concern
her
personal
appearance
(
which
I
have
instruct
her
to
regard
as
dust
in
the
balance
compare
with
the
cultivation
of
her
mind
and
manner
)
;
and
I
never
see
a
child
so
susceptible
of
flattery
as
she
be
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
be
wrong
,
in
either
her
or
her
brother
,
he
would
encourage
by
laugh
at
,
if
not
by
actually
praise
:
 
people
little
know
the
injury
they
do
to
child
by
laugh
at
their
fault
,
and
make
a
pleasant
jest
of
what
their
true
friend
have
endeavour
to
teach
them
to
hold
in
grave
abhorrence
.
  
<EOS>
though
not
a
positive
drunkard
,
Mr.
Robson
habitually
swallow
great
quantity
of
wine
,
and
take
with
relish
an
occasional
glass
of
brandy
and
water
.
 
<EOS>
He
teach
his
nephew
to
imitate
him
in
this
to
the
utmost
of
his
ability
,
and
to
believe
that
the
more
wine
and
spirit
he
could
take
,
and
the
well
he
like
them
,
the
more
he
manifest
his
bold
,
and
manly
spirit
,
and
rise
superior
to
his
sister
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Bloomfield
have
not
much
to
say
against
it
,
for
his
favourite
beverage
be
gin
and
water
;
of
which
he
take
a
considerable
portion
every
day
,
by
dint
of
constant
sip
 
and
to
that
I
chiefly
attribute
his
dingy
complexion
and
waspish
temper
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Robson
likewise
encourage
Tom
's
propensity
to
persecute
the
low
creation
,
both
by
precept
and
example
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
frequently
come
to
course
or
shoot
over
his
brother
-
in
-
law
's
ground
,
he
would
bring
his
favourite
dog
with
him
;
and
he
treat
them
so
brutally
that
,
poor
as
I
be
,
I
would
have
give
a
sovereign
any
day
to
see
one
of
them
bite
him
,
<EOS>
provide
the
animal
could
have
do
it
with
impunity
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
when
in
a
very
complacent
mood
,
he
would
go
a
-
birds'-nesting
with
the
child
,
a
thing
that
irritate
and
annoy
me
exceedingly
;
as
,
by
frequent
and
persevere
attempt
<EOS>
,
I
flatter
myself
<EOS>
I
have
partly
show
them
the
evil
of
this
pastime
,
and
hope
,
in
time
,
to
bring
them
to
some
general
sense
of
justice
and
humanity
;
but
ten
minute
'
birds'-nesting
with
uncle
Robson
,
or
even
a
laugh
from
him
at
some
relation
of
their
former
barbarity
,
be
sufficient
at
once
to
destroy
the
effect
of
my
whole
elaborate
course
of
reasoning
and
persuasion
.
 
<EOS>
happily
,
however
,
during
that
spring
,
they
never
,
but
once
,
get
anything
but
empty
nest
,
or
egg
 
be
too
impatient
to
leave
them
till
the
bird
be
hatch
;
that
once
,
Tom
,
who
have
be
with
his
uncle
into
the
neighbouring
plantation
,
come
run
in
high
glee
into
the
garden
,
with
a
brood
of
little
callow
nestling
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
Ann
and
Fanny
,
whom
I
be
just
bring
out
,
run
to
admire
his
spoil
,
and
to
beg
each
a
bird
for
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
not
one
!
"
cry
Tom
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
all
mine
;
uncle
Robson
give
them
to
me
 
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
,
five
 
<EOS>
you
shall
not
touch
one
of
them
!
<EOS>
no
,
not
one
,
for
your
life
!
"
<EOS>
continue
he
,
exultingly
;
lay
the
nest
on
the
ground
,
and
stand
over
it
with
his
leg
wide
apart
,
his
hand
thrust
into
his
breech
-
pocket
,
his
body
bend
forward
,
and
his
face
twist
into
all
manner
of
contortion
in
the
ecstasy
of
his
delight
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
shall
see
me
fettle
'em
off
.
 
<EOS>
My
word
,
but
<EOS>
I
WILL
wallop
'em
?
 
<EOS>
see
if
I
do
not
now
.
 
<EOS>
by
gum
!
<EOS>
but
there
be
rare
sport
for
me
in
that
nest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Tom
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
shall
not
allow
you
to
torture
those
bird
.
<EOS>
They
must
either
be
kill
at
once
or
carry
back
to
the
place
you
take
them
from
,
that
the
old
bird
may
continue
to
feed
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
do
not
know
where
that
is
,
Madam
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
only
me
and
uncle
Robson
that
know
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
you
do
not
tell
me
,
I
shall
kill
them
myself
 
much
as
I
hate
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
dare
not
.
 
<EOS>
You
dare
not
touch
them
for
your
life
!
<EOS>
because
you
know
papa
and
mamma
,
and
uncle
Robson
,
would
be
angry
.
 
<EOS>
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
I
have
catch
you
there
,
Miss
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
do
what
I
think
right
in
a
case
of
this
sort
without
consult
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
if
your
papa
and
mamma
do
not
happen
to
approve
of
it
,
I
shall
be
sorry
to
offend
them
;
but
<EOS>
your
uncle
Robson
's
opinion
,
of
course
,
be
nothing
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
so
say
 
urge
by
a
sense
of
duty
 
at
the
risk
of
both
make
myself
sick
and
incur
the
wrath
of
my
employer
 
<EOS>
I
get
a
large
flat
stone
,
that
have
be
rear
up
for
a
mouse
-
trap
by
the
gardener
;
then
,
have
once
more
vainly
endeavour
to
persuade
the
little
tyrant
to
let
the
bird
be
carry
back
,
I
ask
what
he
intend
to
do
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
with
fiendish
glee
he
commence
a
list
of
torment
;
and
while
he
be
busy
in
the
relation
,
I
drop
the
stone
upon
his
intend
victim
and
crush
them
flat
beneath
it
.
<EOS>
Loud
be
the
outcry
,
terrible
the
execration
,
consequent
upon
this
daring
outrage
;
uncle
Robson
have
be
come
up
the
walk
with
his
gun
,
and
be
just
then
pause
to
kick
his
dog
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
fly
towards
him
,
vow
he
would
make
him
kick
me
instead
of
Juno
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Robson
leant
upon
his
gun
,
and
laugh
excessively
at
the
violence
of
his
nephew
's
passion
,
and
the
bitter
malediction
and
opprobrious
epithet
he
heap
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
are
a
good
"
un
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
he
,
at
length
,
take
up
his
weapon
and
proceeding
towards
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
Damme
,
but
<EOS>
the
lad
have
some
spunk
in
him
,
too
.
<EOS>
curse
me
,
if
ever
I
see
a
noble
little
scoundrel
than
that

<EOS>
He
be
beyond
petticoat
government
already
:
 
by
God
!
<EOS>
he
defy
mother
,
granny
,
governess
,
and
all
!
 
<EOS>
ha
,
ha

ha

<EOS>
never
mind
,
<EOS>
Tom
,
I
will
get
you
another
brood
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
do
,
Mr.
Robson
,
I
shall
kill
them
too
,
"
say
I.
  
"
Humph
!
"
<EOS>
reply
he
,
and
have
honour
me
with
a
broad
stare
 
which
,
contrary
to
his
expectation
,
I
sustain
without
flinch
 
he
turn
away
with
an
air
of
supreme
contempt
,
and
stalk
into
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
next
go
to
tell
his
mamma
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
her
way
to
say
much
on
any
subject
;
but
,
when
she
next
see
me
,
her
aspect
and
demeanour
be
doubly
dark
and
chill
.
 
<EOS>
after
some
casual
remark
about
the
weather
,
she
observe
"
I
be
sorry
,
Miss
Grey
,
you
should
think
it
necessary
to
interfere
with
Master
Bloomfield
's
amusement
;
he
be
very
much
distressed
about
your
destroy
the
bird
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
when
Master
Bloomfield
's
amusement
consist
in
injure
sentient
creature
,
"
I
answer
,
"
I
think
it
my
duty
to
interfere
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
have
forget
,
"
say
she
,
calmly
,
"
that
the
creature
be
all
create
for
our
convenience
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
that
doctrine
admit
some
doubt
,
but
merely
reply
 
<EOS>
"
if
they
be
,
we
have
no
right
to
torment
them
for
our
amusement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
say
she
,
"
a
child
's
amusement
be
scarcely
to
be
weigh
against
the
welfare
of
a
soulless
brute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
for
the
child
's
own
sake
,
it
ought
not
to
be
encourage
to
have
such
amusement
,
"
answer
I
,
as
meekly
as
I
could
,
to
make
up
for
such
unusual
pertinacity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Blessed
be
the
merciful
,
for
they
shall
obtain
mercy
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
of
course
;
but
that
refer
to
our
conduct
towards
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
the
merciful
man
show
mercy
to
his
beast
,
"
"
I
venture
to
add
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
have
not
show
much
mercy
,
"
reply
she
,
with
a
short
,
bitter
laugh
;
"
kill
the
poor
bird
by
wholesale
in
that
shocking
manner
,
and
put
the
dear
boy
to
such
misery
for
a
mere
whim
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
judge
it
prudent
to
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
near
approach
to
a
quarrel
I
ever
have
with
Mrs.
Bloomfield
;
as
well
as
the
great
number
of
word
I
ever
exchange
with
her
at
one
time
,
since
the
day
of
my
first
arrival
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Robson
and
old
Mrs.
Bloomfield
be
not
the
only
guest
whose
come
to
Wellwood
House
annoy
me
;
every
visitor
disturb
me
more
or
less
;
not
so
much
because
they
neglect
me
(
though
I
do
feel
their
conduct
strange
and
disagreeable
in
that
respect
)
,
as
because
I
find
it
impossible
to
keep
my
pupil
away
from
them
,
as
I
be
repeatedly
desire
to
do
:
 
<EOS>
Tom
must
talk
to
them
,
and
Mary
Ann
must
be
notice
by
them
.
 
<EOS>
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
know
what
it
be
to
feel
any
degree
of
shamefacedness
,
or
even
common
modesty
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
indecently
and
clamorously
interrupt
the
conversation
of
their
elder
,
tease
them
with
the
most
impertinent
question
,
roughly
collar
the
gentleman
,
climb
their
knee
uninvited
,
hang
about
their
shoulder
or
rifle
their
pocket
,
pull
the
lady
'
gown
,
disorder
their
hair
,
tumble
their
collar
,
and
importunately
beg
for
their
trinket
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bloomfield
have
the
sense
to
be
shock
and
annoy
at
all
this
,
but
she
have
not
sense
to
prevent
it
:
 
she
expect
me
to
prevent
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
could
I
 
when
the
guest
,
with
their
fine
clothe
and
new
face
,
continually
flatter
and
indulge
them
,
out
of
complaisance
to
their
parent
 
<EOS>
how
could
I
,
with
my
homely
garment
,
every
-
day
face
,
and
honest
word
,
draw
them
away
?
 
<EOS>
I
strain
every
nerve
to
do
so
:
 
by
strive
to
amuse
them
<EOS>
,
I
endeavour
to
attract
them
to
my
side
;
by
the
exertion
of
such
authority
as
I
possess
,
and
by
such
severity
as
I
dare
to
use
,
I
try
to
deter
them
from
torment
the
guest
;
and
by
reproach
their
unmannerly
conduct
,
to
make
them
ashamed
to
repeat
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
know
no
shame
;
they
scorn
authority
which
have
no
terror
to
back
it
;
and
as
for
kindness
and
affection
,
either
they
have
no
heart
,
or
such
as
they
have
be
so
strongly
guard
,
and
so
well
conceal
,
that
I
,
with
all
my
effort
,
have
not
yet
discover
how
to
reach
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
soon
my
trial
in
this
quarter
come
to
a
close
 
sooner
than
I
either
expect
or
desire
;
for
one
sweet
evening
towards
the
close
of
May
,
as
I
be
rejoice
in
the
near
approach
of
the
holiday
,
and
congratulate
myself
upon
have
make
some

with
my
pupil

as
far
as
their
learning
go

at

I
have
instill
something
into
their
head

I
have

at

bring
them
to
be

more
rational

themselves

Mrs.
Bloomfield
send
for
me
,
and
calmly
tell
me
that
after
Midsummer
my
service
would
be
no
longer
require

<EOS>
She
assure
me
that
my
character
and
general
conduct
be
unexceptionable
;
but
the
child
have
make
so
little
improvement
since
my
arrival
that
Mr.
Bloomfield
and
she
feel
it
their
duty
to
seek
some
other
mode
of
instruction

<EOS>
though
superior
to
most
child
of
their
year
in
ability

they
be
decidedly
behind
them
in
attainment
;
their
manner
be
uncultivated
,
and
their
temper
unruly
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
she
attribute
to
a
want
of
sufficient
firmness
,
and
diligent
,
persevere
care
on
my
part

<EOS>
unshaken
firmness
,
devoted
diligence
,
unwearied
perseverance
,
unceasing
care

be
the
very
qualification
on
which
I
have
secretly
pride
myself
;
and
by
which
I
have
hope
in
time
to
overcome
all
difficulty
,
and
obtain
success
at
last

<EOS>
I
wish
to
say
something
in
my
own
justification

but
in
attempt
to
speak
,
I
feel
my
voice
falter
;
and
rather
than
testify
any
emotion
,
or
suffer
the
tear
to
overflow
that
be
already
gather
in
my
eye
,
I
choose
to
keep
silence
,
and
bear
all
like
a
self

convict
culprit

I
dismiss

thus
I
seek
my

<EOS>
unable

this
be
an
unwelcome

vexed

disappoint

I

greatly

I

genuine

from
all

what
I

My

no

my

I

all

back
again

lavish
more
kindness

ever
upon
me

to

My

you

I
wonder

Richard

you
can
think
of
bother
your
head
about
our
poverty
in

as
if
that

be
anything
compare
with
the
calamity
of
lose
you
 
an
affliction
that
you
well

swallow
up
all
other

which
you
ought

do
your

preserve

I

Alice

it

the

I
know
I
be
sulky
sometimes

I
should
have
be
glad
to
see
these
child
sulky
sometimes
too

for
then
I
could
have
understand

it

no

still
it
be
very

You
can

I
have
all

you

paler

Mary

me
I

I
do
not

for
I
be
in
a
constant
state

agitation

after
some
further

my

promise
once
more
to
assist
me

provide
I
would
wait

patient

I
leave
her
to
broach
the
matter
to
my

when

how
she
deem
it
most
advisable

she
,
to
my
chagrin

make
me
reject
the
situation
one
after
another

these

low

at

she
advise

myself

you
shall
try
your

high

more

those

proud

<EOS>
I
have
know
several
among
the
high
rank
who
treat
their
governess
quite
as
one
of
the
family

though
some
,
I
allow
,
be
as
insolent

exact
as
any

else

there

the
advertisement
be
quickly
write
and
despatch

<EOS>
of
the
two
party
who
answer
it

one
would
consent
to
give
me
fifty
pound

the
sum
my
mother
bid
me
name
as
the
salary
I
should
require
;
and
here
,
I
hesitate
about
engage
myself
,
as
I
fear
the
child
would
be
too
old
,
and
their
parent
would
require
some
one
more
showy
,
or
more
experienced
,
if
not
more
accomplished
than
i.
 
<EOS>
but
my
mother
dissuade
me
from
decline
it
on
that
account
:
I
should
do
vastly
well
,
she
say
,
if
I
would
only
throw
aside
my
diffidence
,
and
acquire
a
little
more
confidence
in
myself

<EOS>
I
be
just
to
give
a
plain
,
true
statement
of
my
acquirement
and
qualification
,
and
name
<EOS>
what
stipulation
I
choose
to
make
,
and
then
await
the
result
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
stipulation
I
venture
to
propose
,
be
that
I
may
be
allow
two
month
'
holiday
during
the
year
to
visit
my
friend
,
at
Midsummer
and
Christmas
.
 
<EOS>
the
unknown
lady
,
in
her
reply
,
make
no
objection
to
this
,
and
state
that
,
as
to
my
acquirement
,
she
have
no
doubt
I
should
be
able
to
give
satisfaction
;
but
in
the
engagement
of
governess
she
consider
those
thing
as
but
subordinate
point
;
as
be
situate
in
the
neighbourhood
of
o

,
she
could
get
master
to
supply
any
deficiency
in
that
respect
:
 
but
,
in
her
opinion
,
next
to
unimpeachable
morality
,
a
mild
and
cheerful
temper
and
obliging
disposition
be
the
most
essential
requisitie
.
  
<EOS>
My
mother
do
not
relish
this
at
all
,
and
now
make
many
objection
to
my
accept
the
situation
;
in
which
my
sister
warmly
support
her
:
 
but
,
unwilling
to
be
balk
again
,
I
overrule
them
all
;
and
,
have
first
obtain
the
consent
of
my
father
(
who
have
,
a
short
time
previously
,
be
apprise
of
these
transaction
)
,
I
write
a
most
obliging
epistle
to
my
unknown
correspondent

and
,
finally
,
the
bargain
be
conclude

<EOS>
It
be
decree
that
on
the
last

Horton
Lodge
,
near
o
#
#
#
#
,
about
seventy
mile
from
our
village
:
 
a
formidable
distance
to
me
,
as
I
have
never
be
above
twenty
mile
from
home
in
all
the
course
of
my
twenty
year
'
sojourn
on
earth
;
and
as
,
moreover
,
every
individual
in
that
family
and
in
the
neighbourhood
be
utterly
unknown
to
myself
and
all
my
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
render
it
only
the
more
piquant
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
,
in
some
measure
,
get
rid
of
the
mauvaise
honte
that
have
formerly
oppress
me
so
much
;
there
be
a
pleasing
excitement
in
the
idea
of
enter
these
unknown
region
,
and
make
my
way
alone
among
its
strange
inhabitant
.
 
<EOS>
I
now
flatter
myself
I
be
go
to
see
something
in
the
world
:
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Murray
's
residence
be
near
a
large
town
,
and
not
in
a
manufacturing
district
,
where
the
people
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
make
money
;
his
rank
from
what
I
could
gather
,
appear
to
be
high
than
that
of
Mr.
Bloomfield
;
and
,
doubtless
,
he
be
one
of
those
genuine
thoroughbred
gentry
my
mother
speak
of
,
who
would
treat
his
governess
with
due
consideration
as
a
respectable
well
-
educate
lady
,
the
instructor
and
guide
of
his
child
,
and
not
a
mere
upper
servant
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
my
pupil
be
old
,
would
be
more
rational
,
more
teachable
,
and
less
troublesome
than
the
last
;
they
would
be
less
confine
to
the
schoolroom
,
and
not
require
that
constant
labour
and
incessant
watching
;
and
,
finally
,
bright
vision
mingle
with
my
hope
,
with
which
the
care
of
child
and
the
mere
duty
of
a
governess
have
little
or
nothing
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
the
reader
will
see
that
I
have
no
claim
to
be
regard
as
a
martyr
to
filial
piety
,
go
forth
to
sacrifice
peace
and
liberty
for
the
sole
purpose
of
lay
up
store
for
the
comfort
and
support
of
my
parent
:
 
though
certainly
the
comfort
of
my
father
,
and
the
future
support
of
my
mother
,
have
a
large
share
in
my
calculation
;
and
fifty
pound
appear
to
me
no
ordinary
sum
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
decent
clothe
become
my
station
;
I
must
,
it
seem
,
put
out
my
washing
,
and
also
pay
for
my
four
annual
journey
between
Horton
Lodge
and
home
;
but
with
strict
attention
to
economy
,
surely
twenty
pound
,
or
little
more
,
would
cover
those
expense
,
and
then
there
would
be
thirty
for
the
bank
,
or
little
less
:
 
what
a
valuable
addition
to
our
stock
!
 
<EOS>
oh
,
I
must
struggle
to
keep
this
situation
,
whatever
it
may
be
!
<EOS>
both
for
my
own
honour
among
my
friend
and
for
the
solid
service
I
may
render
them
by
my
continuance
there
.

HORTON
LODGE
  
<EOS>
the
31st
of
January
be
a
wild
,
tempestuous
day
:
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
strong
north
wind
,
with
a
continual
storm
of
snow
drift
on
the
ground
and
whirl
through
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
My
friend
would
have
have
me
delay
my
departure
,
but
fearful
of
prejudice
my
employer
against
me
by
such
want
of
punctuality
at
the
commencement
of
my
undertaking
,
I
persist
in
keep
the
appointment
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
inflict
upon
my
reader
an
account
of
my
leave
home
on
that
dark
winter
morning
:
 
<EOS>
the
fond
farewell
,
the
long
,
long
journey
to
o
#
#
#
#
,
the
solitary
waiting
in
inn
for
coach
or
train
 
<EOS>
for
there
be
some
railway
then
 
<EOS>
and
,
finally
,
the
meeting
at
o
#
#
#
#
with
Mr.
Murray
's
servant
,
who
have
be
send
with
the
phaeton
to
drive
me
from
thence
to
Horton
Lodge
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
just
state
that
the
heavy
snow
have
throw
such
impediment
in
the
way
of
both
horse
and
steam
-
engine
,
that
it
be
dark
some
hour
before
I
reach
my
journey
's
end
,
and
that
a
most
bewildering
storm
come
on
at
last
,
which
make
the
few
mile
'
space
between
o
#
#
#
#
and
Horton
Lodge
a
long
and
formidable
passage
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
resign
,
with
the
cold
,
sharp
snow
drift
through
my
veil
and
fill
my
lap
,
see
nothing
,
and
wonder
how
the
unfortunate
horse
and
driver
could
make
their
way
even
as
well
as
they
do
;
and
indeed
it
be
but
a
toilsome
,
creep
style
of
progression
,
to
say
the
good
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
we
pause
;
and
,
at
the
call
of
the
driver
,
someone
unlatched
and
roll
back
upon
their
creaking
hinge
what
appear
to
be
the
park
gate
.
 
<EOS>
then
we
proceed
along
a
smooth
road
,
whence
,
occasionally
<EOS>
,
I
perceive
some
huge
,
hoary
mass
gleam
through
the
darkness
,
which
I
take
to
be
a
portion
of
a
snow
-
clothe
tree
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
considerable
time
we
pause
again
,
before
the
stately
portico
of
a
large
house
with
long
window
descend
to
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
I
rise
with
some
difficulty
from
under
the
superincumbent
snowdrift
,
and
alight
from
the
carriage
,
expect
that
a
kind
and
hospitable
reception
would
indemnify
me
for
the
toil
and
hardship
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
a
gentleman
person
in
black
open
the
door
,
and
admit
me
into
a
spacious
hall
,
light
by
an
amber
-
colour
lamp
suspend
from
the
ceiling
;
he
lead
me
through
this
,
along
a
passage
,
and
open
the
door
of
a
back
room
,
tell
me
that
be
the
schoolroom
.
 
<EOS>
I
enter
,
and
find
two
young
lady
and
two
young
gentleman
 
my
future
pupil
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
formal
greeting
,
the
eld
girl
,
who
be
trifle
over
a
piece
of
canvas
and
a
basket
of
german
wool
,
ask
if
I
should
like
to
go
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
I
reply
in
the
affirmative
,
of
course
.
  
<EOS>
"
Matilda
,
take
a
candle
,
and
show
her
her
room
,
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matilda
,
a
strap
hoyden
of
about
fourteen
,
with
a
short
frock
and
trouser
,
shrug
her
shoulder
and
make
a
slight
grimace
,
but
take
a
candle
and
proceed
before
me
up
the
back
stair
(
a
long
,
steep
,
double
flight
)
,
and
through
a
long
,
narrow
passage
,
to
a
small
but
tolerably
comfortable
room
.
 
<EOS>
She
then
ask
me
if
I
would
take
some
tea
or
coffee
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
about
to
answer
<EOS>
no
;
but
<EOS>
remember
that
I
have
take
nothing
since
seven
o'clock
that
morning
,
and
feel
faint
in
consequence
,
I
say
I
would
take
a
cup
of
tea
.
 
<EOS>
say
she
would
tell
"
Brown
,
"
the
young
lady
depart
;
and
by
the
time
I
have
divest
myself
of
my
heavy
,
wet
cloak
,
shawl
,
bonnet
,
&
c.
,
a
mince
damsel
come
to
say
the
young
lady
desire
to
know
whether
I
would
take
my
tea
up
there
or
in
the
schoolroom
.
 
<EOS>
under
the
plea
of
fatigue
I
choose
to
take
it
there
.
 
<EOS>
She
withdraw
;
and
,
after
a
while
,
return
again
with
a
small
tea
-
tray
,
and
place
it
on
the
chest
of
drawer
,
which
serve
as
a
dressing
-
table
.
 
<EOS>
have
civilly
thank
her
,
I
ask
at
what
time
I
should
be
expect
to
rise
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
young
lady
and
gentleman
breakfast
at
half
-
past
eight
,
madam
,
"
say
she
;
"
they
rise
early
;
but
,
as
they
seldom
do
any
lesson
before
breakfast
,
I
should
think
it
will
do
if
you
rise
soon
after
seven
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
desire
her
to
be
so
kind
as
to
call
me
at
seven
,
and
,
promise
to
do
so
,
she
withdraw
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
have
break
my
long
fast
on
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
little
thin
bread
and
butter
,
I
sit
down
beside
the
small
,
smoulder
fire
,
and
amuse
myself
with
a
hearty
fit
of
crying
;
after
which
,
I
say
my
prayer
,
and
then
,
feel
considerably
relieved
,
begin
to
prepare
for
bed
.
 
<EOS>
find
that
none
of
my
luggage
be
bring
up
,
I
institute
a
search
for
the
bell
;
and
fail
to
discover
any
sign
of
such
a
convenience
in
any
corner
of
the
room
<EOS>
,
I
take
my
candle
and
venture
through
the
long
passage
,
and
down
the
steep
stair
,
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
.
<EOS>
meet
a
well
-
dress
female
on
the
way
,
I
tell
her
what
I
want
;
but
not
without
considerable
hesitation
,
as
I
be
not
quite
sure
whether
it
be
one
of
the
upper
servant
,
or
Mrs.
Murray
herself
:
it
happen
,
however
,
to
be
the
lady's
-
maid
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
air
of
one
confer
an
unusual
favour
,
she
vouchsafe
to
undertake
the
sending
up
of
my
thing
;
and
when
I
have
re
-
enter
my
room
,
and
wait
and
wonder
a
long
time
(
greatly
fear
that
she
have
forget
or
neglect
to
perform
her
promise
,
and
doubt
whether
to
keep
wait
or
go
to
bed
,
or
go
down
again
)
,
my
hope
,
at
length
,
be
revive
by
the
sound
of
voice
and
laughter
,
accompany
by
the
tramp
of
foot
along
the
passage
;
and
presently
the
luggage
be
bring
in
by
a
rough
-
look
maid
and
a
man
,
neither
of
them
very
respectful
in
their
demeanour
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
have
shut
the
door
upon
their
retire
footstep
,
and
unpack
a
few
of
my
thing
,
I
betook
myself
to
rest
;
gladly
enough
,
for
I
be
weary
in
body
and
mind
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
with
a
strange
feeling
of
desolation
,
mingle
with
a
strong
sense
of
the
novelty
of
my
situation
,
and
a
joyless
kind
of
curiosity
concern
what
be
yet
unknown
,
that
I
awake
the
next
morning
;
feel
like
one
whirl
away
by
enchantment
,
and
suddenly
drop
from
the
cloud
into
a
remote
and
unknown
land
,
widely
and
completely
isolate
from
all
he
have
ever
see
or
know
before
;
or
like
a
thistle
-
seed
borne
on
the
wind
to
some
strange
nook
of
uncongenial
soil
,
where
it
must
lie
long
enough
before
it
can
take
root
and
germinate
,
extract
nourishment
from
what
appear
so
alien
to
its
nature
:
 
if
,
indeed
,
it
ever
can
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
give
no
proper
idea
of
my
feeling
at
all
;
and
no
one
that
have
not
live
such
a
retired
,
stationary
life
as
mine
,
can
possibly
imagine
what
they
be
:
 
hardly
even
if
he
have
know
what
it
be
to
awake
some
morning
,
and
find
himself
in
Port
Nelson
,
in
New
Zealand
,
with
a
world
of
water
between
himself
and
all
that
know
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
not
soon
forget
the
peculiar
feeling
with
which
I
raise
my
blind
and
look
out
upon
the
unknown
world
:
 
<EOS>
a
wide
,
white
wilderness
be
all
that
meet
my
gaze
;
a
waste
of
  
desert
toss
in
snow
,
and
heavy
laden
grove
.
  
<EOS>
I
descend
to
the
schoolroom
with
no
remarkable
eagerness
to
join
my
pupil
,
though
not
without
some
feeling
of
curiosity
respect
what
a
further
acquaintance
would
reveal
.
 
<EOS>
one
thing
,
among
other
of
more
obvious
importance
,
I
determine
with
myself
 
<EOS>
I
must
begin
with
call
them
Miss
and
Master
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
a
chilling
and
unnatural
piece
of
punctilio
between
the
child
of
a
family
and
their
instructor
and
daily
companion
;
especially
where
the
former
be
in
their
early
childhood
,
as
at
Wellwood
House
;
but
even
there
,
my
call
the
little
Bloomfields
by
their
simple
name
have
be
regard
as
an
offensive
liberty
:
 
as
their
parent
have
take
care
to
show
me
,
by
carefully
designate
them
MASTER
and
MISS
Bloomfield
,
&
c.
,
in
speak
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
very
slow
to
take
the
hint
,
because
the
whole
affair
strike
me
as
so
very
absurd
;
but
now
I
determine
to
be
wise
,
and
begin
at
once
with
as
much
form
and
ceremony
as
any
member
of
the
family
would
be
likely
to
require
:
 
and
,
indeed
,
the
child
be
so
much
old
<EOS>
,
there
would
be
less
difficulty
;
though
the
little
word
Miss
and
Master
seem
to
have
a
surprising
effect
in
repress
all
familiar
,
open
-
hearted
kindness
,
and
extinguish
every
gleam
of
cordiality
that
may
arise
between
us
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
can
not
,
like
Dogberry
,
find
it
in
my
heart
to
bestow
all
my
tediousness
upon
the
reader
,
I
will
not
go
on
to
bore
him
with
a
minute
detail
of
all
the
discovery
and
proceeding
of
this
and
the
follow
day
.
 
<EOS>
no
doubt
he
will
be
amply
satisfied
with
a
slight
sketch
of
the
different
member
of
the
family
,
and
a
general
view
of
the
first
year
or
two
of
my
sojourn
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
to
begin
with
the
head
:
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Murray
be
,
by
all
account
,
a
blustering
,
roystering
,
<EOS>
country
squire
:
 
a
devoted
fox
-
hunter
,
a
skilful
horse
-
jockey
and
farri
,
an
active
,
practical
farmer
,
and
a
hearty
bon
vivant
.
 
<EOS>
by
all
account
,
I
say
;
for
,
except
on
Sundays
,
when
he
go
to
church
,
I
never
see
him
from
month
to
month
:
 
unless
,
in
cross
the
hall
or
walk
in
the
ground
,
the
figure
of
a
tall
,
stout
gentleman
,
with
scarlet
cheek
and
crimson
nose
,
happen
to
come
across
me
;
on
which
occasion
,
if
he
pass
near
enough
to
speak
,
an
unceremonious
nod
,
accompany
by
a
"
Morning
,
Miss
Grey
,
"
or
some
such
brief
salutation
,
be
usually
vouchsafe
.
  
<EOS>
frequently
,
indeed
,
his
loud
laugh
reach
me
from
afar
;
and
oftener
<EOS>
still
I
hear
him
swear
and
blaspheme
against
the
footman
,
groom
,
coachman
,
or
some
other
hapless
dependant
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Murray
be
a
handsome
,
dash
lady
of
forty
,
who
certainly
require
neither
rouge
nor
padding
to
add
to
her
charm
;
and
whose
chief
enjoyment
be
,
or
seem
to
be
,
in
give
or
frequent
party
,
and
in
dress
at
the
very
top
of
the
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
her
till
eleven
o'clock
on
the
morning
after
my
arrival
;
when
she
honour
me
with
a
visit
,
just
as
my
mother
may
step
into
the
kitchen
to
see
a
new
servant
-
girl
:
 
yet
not
so
,
either
,
for
my
mother
would
have
see
her
immediately
after
her
arrival
,
and
not
wait
till
the
next
day
;
and
,
moreover
,
she
would
have
address
her
in
a
more
kind
and
friendly
manner
,
and
give
her
some
word
of
comfort
as
well
as
a
plain
exposition
of
her
duty
;
but
Mrs.
Murray
do
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
She
just
step
into
the
schoolroom
on
her
return
from
order
dinner
in
the
housekeeper
's
room
,
bade
me
good
-
morning
,
stand
for
two
minute
by
the
fire
,
say
a
few
word
about
the
weather
and
the
"
rather
rough
"
journey
I
must
have
have
yesterday
;
pet
her
young
child
 
<EOS>
a
boy
of
ten
 
who
have
just
be
wipe
his
mouth
and
hand
on
her
gown
,
after
indulge
in
some
savoury
morsel
from
the
housekeeper
's
store
;
tell
me
what
a
sweet
,
good
boy
he
be
;
and
then
sail
out
,
with
a
self
-
complacent
smile
upon
her
face
:
 
thinking
,
no
doubt
,
that
she
have
do
quite
enough
for
the
present
,
and
have
be
delightfully
condescend
into
the
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
Her
child
evidently
hold
the
same
opinion
,
and
I
alone
think
otherwise
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
she
look
in
upon
me
once
or
twice
,
during
the
absence
of
my
pupil
,
to
enlighten
me
concern
my
duty
towards
them
.
<EOS>
for
the
girl
she
seem
anxious
only
to
render
them
as
superficially
attractive
and
showily
accomplish
as
they
could
possibly
be
make
,
without
present
trouble
or
discomfort
to
themselves
;
and
I
be
to
act
accordingly
 
to
study
and
strive
to
amuse
and
oblige
,
instruct
,
refine
,
and
polish
,
with
the
least
possible
exertion
on
their
part
,
and
no
exercise
of
authority
on
mine
.
 
<EOS>
with
regard
to
the
two
boy
,
it
be
much
the
same
;
only
instead
of
accomplishment
,
I
be
to
get
the
great
possible
quantity
of
Latin
grammar
and
Valpy
's
Delectus
into
their
head
,
in
order
to
fit
them
for
school
 
the
great
possible
quantity
at
least
without
trouble
to
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
John
may
be
a
"
little
high-
spirit
,
"
and
Charles
may
be
a
little
"
nervous
and
tedious
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
at
all
event
,
Miss
Grey
,
"
say
she
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
keep
your
temper
,
and
be
mild
and
patient
throughout
;
especially
with
the
dear
little
Charles
;
he
be
so
extremely
nervous
and
susceptible
,
and
so
utterly
unaccustomed
to
anything
but
the
tender
treatment
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
excuse
my
name
these
thing
to
you
;
for
the
fact
be
,
I
have
hitherto
find
all
the
governess
,
even
the
very
good
of
them
,
faulty
in
this
particular
.
 
<EOS>
They
want
that
meek
and
quiet
spirit
,
<EOS>
which
St.
Matthew
,
or
some
of
them
,
say
be
well
than
the
putting
on
of
apparel
 
<EOS>
you
will
know
the
passage
to
which
I
allude
,
for
you
be
a
clergyman
's
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
no
doubt
you
will
give
satisfaction
in
this
respect
as
well
as
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
and
remember
,
on
all
occasion
,
<EOS>
when
any
of
the
young
people
do
anything
improper
,
if
persuasion
and
gentle
remonstrance
will
not
do
,
let
one
of
the
other
come
and
tell
me
;
for
I
can
speak
to
them
more
plainly
than
it
would
be
proper
for
you
to
do
.
<EOS>
and
make
them
as
happy
as
you
can
,
Miss
Grey
,
and
I
dare
say
you
will
do
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
observe
that
while
Mrs.
Murray
be
so
extremely
solicitous
for
the
comfort
and
happiness
of
her
child
,
and
continually
talk
about
it
,
she
never
once
mention
mine
;
though
they
be
at
home
,
surround
by
friend
,
and
I
an
alien
among
stranger
;
and
I
do
not
yet
know
enough
of
the
world
,
not
to
be
considerably
surprised
at
this
anomaly
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Murray
,
otherwise
Rosalie
,
be
about
sixteen
when
I
come
,
and
decidedly
a
very
pretty
girl
;
and
in
two
year
longer
,
as
time
more
completely
develop
her
form
and
add
grace
to
her
carriage
and
deportment
,
she
become
positively
beautiful
;
and
that
in
no
common
degree
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
tall
and
slend
,
yet
not
thin
;
perfectly
form
,
exquisitely
fair
,
though
not
without
a
brilliant
,
healthy
bloom
;
her
hair
,
which
she
wear
in
a
profusion
of
long
ringlet
,
be
of
a
very
light
brown
incline
to
yellow
;
her
eye
be
pale
blue
,
but
so
clear
and
bright
that
few
would
wish
them
darker
;
the
rest
of
her
feature
be
small
,
not
quite
regular
,
and
not
remarkably
otherwise
:
 
but
altogether
you
could
not
hesitate
to
pronounce
her
a
very
lovely
girl
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
say
as
much
for
mind
and
disposition
as
I
can
for
her
form
and
face
.
  
<EOS>
yet
think
not
I
have
any
dreadful
disclosure
to
make
:
 
<EOS>
she
be
lively
,
light
-
hearted
,
and
could
be
very
agreeable
,
with
those
who
do
not
cross
her
will
.
 
<EOS>
towards
me
,
when
I
first
come
,
she
be
cold
and
haughty
,
then
insolent
and
overbearing
;
but
,
on
a
further
acquaintance
,
she
gradually
lay
aside
her
air
,
and
in
time
become
as
deeply
attached
to
me
as
it
be
possible
for
HER
to
be
to
one
of
my
character
and
position
:
 
for
she
seldom
lose
sight
,
for
above
half
an
hour
at
a
time
,
of
the
fact
of
my
be
a
hireling
and
a
poor
curate
's
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
upon
the
whole
,
I
believe
she
respect
me
more
than
she
herself
be
aware
of
;
because
I
be
the
only
person
in
the
house
who
steadily
profess
good
principle
<EOS>
,
habitually
speak
the
truth
,
and
generally
endeavour
to
make
inclination
bow
to
duty
;
and
this
I
say
,
not
,
of
course
,
in
commendation
of
myself
,
but
to
show
the
unfortunate
state
of
the
family
to
which
my
service
be
,
for
the
present
,
devoted
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
member
of
it
in
whom
I
regret
this
sad
want
of
principle
so
much
as
Miss
Murray
herself
;
not
only
because
she
have
take
a
fancy
to
me
,
but
because
there
be
so
much
of
what
be
pleasant
and
prepossess
in
herself
,
that
,
in
spite
of
her
failing
,
I
really
like
her
 
when
she
do
not
rouse
my
indignation
,
or
ruffle
my
temper
by
too
great
a
display
of
her
fault
.
 
<EOS>
these
,
however
,
I
would
fain
persuade
myself
be
rather
the
effect
of
her
education
than
her
disposition
:
 
<EOS>
she
have
never
be
perfectly
teach
the
distinction
between
right
and
wrong
;
she
have
,
like
her
brother
and
sister
,
be
suffer
,
from
infancy
,
to
tyrannize
over
nurse
,
governess
,
and
servant
;
she
have
not
be
teach
to
moderate
her
desire
,
to
control
her
temper
or
bridle
her
will
,
or
to
sacrifice
her
own
pleasure
for
the
good
of
other
.
 
<EOS>
Her
temper
be
naturally
good
,
she
be
never
violent
or
morose
,
but
from
constant
indulgence
,
and
habitual
scorn
of
reason
,
she
be
often
testy
and
capricious
;
her
mind
have
never
be
cultivate
:
 
<EOS>
her
intellect
,
at
best
,
be
somewhat
shallow
;
she
possess
considerable
vivacity
,
some
quickness
of
perception
,
and
some
talent
for
music
and
the
acquisition
of
language
,
but
till
fifteen
she
have
trouble
herself
to
acquire
nothing
;
 
then
the
love
of
display
have
rouse
her
faculty
,
and
induce
her
to
apply
herself
,
but
only
to
the
more
showy
accomplishment
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
come
it
be
the
same
:
<EOS>
everything
be
neglect
but
french
,
german
,
music
,
singing
,
dancing
,
fancy
-
work
,
and
a
little
drawing
 
such
drawing
as
may
produce
the
great
show
with
the
small
labour
,
and
the
principal
part
of
which
be
generally
do
by
me
.
 
<EOS>
for
music
and
singing
,
besides
my
occasional
instruction
,
she
have
the
attendance
of
the
good
master
the
country
afford
;
and
in
these
accomplishment
,
as
well
as
in
dancing
,
she
certainly
attain
great
proficiency
.
 
<EOS>
to
music
,
indeed
,
she
devote
too
much
of
her
time
,
as
,
governess
<EOS>
though
I
be
,
I
frequently
tell
her
;
but
her
mother
think
that
if
she
like
it
,
she
COULD
not
give
too
much
time
to
the
acquisition
of
so
attractive
an
art
.
 
<EOS>
of
fancy
-
work
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
but
<EOS>
what
I
gather
from
my
pupil
and
my
own
observation
;
but
no
sooner
be
I
initiate
,
than
she
make
me
useful
in
twenty
different
way
:
 
<EOS>
all
the
tedious
part
of
her
work
be
shift
on
to
my
shoulder
;
such
as
stretch
the
frame
,
stitch
in
the
canvas
,
sort
the
wool
and
silk
,
put
in
the
ground
,
count
the
stitch
,
rectify
mistake
,
and
finish
the
piece
she
be
tired
of
.
  
<EOS>
at
sixteen
,
Miss
Murray
be
something
of
a
romp
,
yet
not
more
so
than
be
natural
and
allowable
for
a
girl
of
that
age
,
but
at
seventeen
,
that
propensity
,
like
all
other
thing
,
begin
to
give
way
to
the
rule
passion
,
and
soon
be
swallow
up
in
the
all
-
absorb
ambition
to
attract
and
dazzle
the
other
sex
.
 
<EOS>
but
enough
of
her
:
 
<EOS>
now
let
us
turn
to
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matilda
Murray
be
a
veritable
hoyden
,
of
whom
little
nee
be
say
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
about
two
year
and
a
half
young
than
her
sister
;
her
feature
be
large
,
her
complexion
much
darker
.
 
<EOS>
She
may
possibly
make
a
handsome
woman
;
but
she
be
far
too
big
-
boned
and
awkward
ever
to
be
call
a
pretty
girl
,
and
at
present
she
care
little
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Rosalie
know
all
her
charm
,
and
think
them
even
great
than
they
be
,
and
value
them
more
highly
than
she
ought
to
have
do
,
have
they
be
three
time
as
great
;
Matilda
think
she
be
well
enough
,
but
care
little
about
the
matter
;
still
less
do
she
care
about
the
cultivation
of
her
mind
,
and
the
acquisition
of
ornamental
accomplishment
.
 
<EOS>
the
manner
in
which
she
learn
her
lesson
and
practise
her
music
be
calculate
to
drive
any
governess
to
despair
.
 
<EOS>
short
and
easy
as
her
task
be
,
if
do
at
all
,
they
be
slur
over
,
at
any
time
and
in
any
way
;
but
generally
at
the
least
convenient
time
,
and
in
the
way
least
beneficial
to
herself
,
and
least
satisfactory
to
me
:
 
the
short
half
-
hour
of
practising
be
horribly
strum
through
;
she
,
meantime
,
unsparingly
abuse
me
,
either
for
interrupt
her
with
correction
,
or
for
not
rectify
her
mistake
before
they
be
make
,
or
something
equally
unreasonable
.
 
<EOS>
once
or
twice
,
I
venture
to
remonstrate
with
her
seriously
for
such
irrational
conduct
;
but
on
each
of
those
occasion
,
I
receive
such
reprehensive
expostulation
from
her
mother
,
as
convince
me
that
,
if
I
wish
to
keep
the
situation
,
I
must
even
let
Miss
Matilda
go
on
in
her
own
way
.
  
<EOS>
when
her
lesson
be
over
,
however
,
her
ill
-
humour
be
generally
over
too
:
 
while
ride
her
spirited
pony
,
or
romp
with
the
dog
or
her
brother
and
sister
,
but
especially
with
her
dear
brother
John
,
she
be
as
happy
as
a
lark
.
 
<EOS>
as
an
animal
,
Matilda
be
all
right
,
full
of
life
,
vigour
,
and
activity
;
as
an
intelligent
being
,
she
be
barbarously
ignorant
,
indocile
,
careless
and
irrational
;
and
,
consequently
,
very
distressing
to
one
who
have
the
task
of
cultivate
her
understanding
,
reform
her
manner
,
and
aid
her
to
acquire
those
ornamental
attainment
which
,
unlike
her
sister
,
she
despise
as
much
as
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mother
be
partly
aware
of
her
deficiency
,
and
give
me
many
a
lecture
as
to
how
I
should
try
to
form
her
taste
,
and
endeavour
to
rouse
and
cherish
her
dormant
vanity
;
and
,
by
insinuate
,
skilful
flattery
,
to
win
her
attention
to
the
desire
object
 
which
I
would
not
do
;
and
how
I
should
prepare
and
smooth
the
path
of
learning
till
she
could
glide
along
it
without
the
least
exertion
to
herself
:
 
which
I
could
not
,
for
nothing
can
be
teach
to
any
purpose
without
some
little
exertion
on
the
part
of
the
learner
.
  
<EOS>
as
a
moral
agent
,
Matilda
be
reckless
,
headstrong
,
violent
,
and
unamenable
to
reason
.
 
<EOS>
one
proof
of
the
deplorable
state
of
her
mind
be
,
that
from
her
father
's
example
she
have
learn
to
swear
like
a
trooper
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mother
be
greatly
shock
at
the
"
unlady
-
like
trick
,
"
and
wonder
"
how
she
have
pick
it
up
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
you
can
soon
break
her
of
it
,
Miss
Grey
,
"
say
she
:
 
<EOS>
"
it
be
only
a
habit
;
and
if
you
will
just
gently
remind
her
every
time
she
do
so
,
I
be
sure
she
will
soon
lay
it
aside
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
not
only
"
gently
remind
"
her
,
I
try
to
impress
upon
her
how
wrong
it
be
,
and
how
distress
to
the
ear
of
decent
people
:
 
but
all
in
vain
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
only
answer
by
a
careless
laugh
,
and
,
"
oh
,
Miss
Grey
,
how
shocked
you
be
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
glad
!
"
<EOS>
or
,
"
well
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
it
;
papa
should
not
have
teach
me
:
 
<EOS>
I
learn
it
all
from
him
;
and
maybe
a
bit
from
the
coachman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
brother
John
,
alias
Master
Murray
,
be
about
eleven
when
I
come
:
 
<EOS>
a
fine
,
stout
,
healthy
boy
,
frank
and
good
-
natured
in
the
main
,
and
may
have
be
a
decent
lad
have
he
be
properly
educate
;
but
now
he
be
as
rough
as
a
young
bear
,
boisterous
,
unruly
,
unprincipled
,
untaught
,
unteachable
 
at
least
,
for
a
governess
under
his
mother
's
eye
.
 
<EOS>
His
master
at
school
may
be
able
to
manage
him
better
 
for
to
school
he
be
send
,
greatly
to
my
relief
,
in
the
course
of
a
year
;
in
a
state
,
it
be
true
,
of
scandalous
ignorance
as
to
Latin
,
as
well
as
the
more
useful
though
more
neglect
thing
:
 
and
this
,
doubtless
,
would
all
be
lay
to
the
account
of
his
education
have
be
entrust
to
an
ignorant
female
teacher
,
who
have
presume
to
take
in
hand
what
she
be
wholly
incompetent
to
perform
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
deliver
from
his
brother
till
full
twelve
month
after
,
when
he
also
be
despatch
in
the
same
state
of
disgraceful
ignorance
as
the
former
.
  
<EOS>
Master
Charles
be
his
mother
's
peculiar
darling
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
little
more
than
a
year
young
than
John
,
but
much
small
,
paler
,
and
less
active
and
robust
;
a
pettish
,
cowardly
,
capricious
,
selfish
little
fellow
,
only
active
in
do
mischief
,
and
only
clever
in
invent
falsehood
:
 
not
simply
to
hide
his
fault
,
but
,
in
mere
malicious
wantonness
,
to
bring
odium
upon
other
.
 
<EOS>
in
fact
,
Master
Charles
be
a
very
great
nuisance
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
trial
of
patience
to
live
with
him
peaceably
;
to
watch
over
him
be
bad
;
and
to
teach
him
,
or
pretend
to
teach
him
,
be
inconceivable
.
 
<EOS>
at
ten
year
old
,
he
could
not
read
correctly
the
easy
line
in
the
simple
book
;
and
as
,
accord
to
his
mother
's
principle
,
he
be
to
be
tell
every
word
,
before
he
have
time
to
hesitate
or
examine
its
orthography
,
and
never
even
to
be
inform
,
as
a
stimulant
to
exertion
,
that
other
boy
be
more
forward
than
he
,
it
be
not
surprising
that
he
make
but
little
progress
during
the
two
year
<EOS>
I
have
charge
of
his
education
.
 
<EOS>
His
minute
portion
of
Latin
grammar
,
&
c.
,
be
to
be
repeat
over
to
him
,
till
he
choose
to
say
he
know
them
,
and
then
he
be
to
be
help
to
say
them
;
if
he
make
mistake
in
his
little
easy
sum
in
arithmetic
,
they
be
to
be
show
him
at
once
,
and
the
sum
do
for
him
,
instead
of
his
be
leave
to
exercise
his
faculty
in
find
them
out
himself
;
so
that
,
of
course
,
he
take
no
pain
to
avoid
mistake
,
but
frequently
set
down
his
figure
at
random
,
without
any
calculation
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
invariably
confine
myself
to
these
rule
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
against
my
conscience
to
do
so
;
but
I
seldom
could
venture
to
deviate
from
them
in
the
slight
degree
,
without
incur
the
wrath
of
my
little
pupil
,
and
subsequently
of
his
mamma
;
to
whom
he
would
relate
my
transgression
maliciously
exaggerate
,
or
adorn
with
embellishment
of
his
own
;
and
often
,
in
consequence
,
be
I
on
the
point
of
lose
or
resign
my
situation
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
for
their
sake
at
home
,
I
smother
my
pride
and
suppress
my
indignation
,
and
manage
to
struggle
on
till
my
little
tormentor
be
despatch
to
school
;
his
father
declare
that
home
education
be
"
no
go
;
for
him
,
it
be
plain
;
his
mother
spoil
him
outrageously
,
and
his
governess
could
make
no
hand
of
him
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
few
more
observation
about
Horton
Lodge
and
its
ongoing
,
and
I
have
do
with
dry
description
for
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
the
house
be
a
very
respectable
one
;
superior
to
Mr.
Bloomfield
's
,
both
in
age
,
size
,
and
magnificence
:
 
the
garden
be
not
so
tastefully
lay
out
;
but
instead
of
the
smooth
-
shave
lawn
,
the
young
tree
guard
by
paling
,
the
grove
of
upstart
poplar
,
and
the
plantation
of
fir
,
there
be
a
wide
park
,
stock
with
deer
,
and
beautify
by
fine
old
tree
.
 
<EOS>
the
surround
country
itself
be
pleasant
,
as
far
as
fertile
field
,
flourish
tree
,
quiet
green
lane
,
and
smile
hedge
with
wild
-
flower
scatter
along
their
bank
,
could
make
it
;
but
it
be
depressingly
flat
to
one
bear
and
nurture
among
the
rugged
hill
of
  
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
situate
nearly
two
mile
from
the
village
church
,
and
,
consequently
,
the
family
carriage
be
put
in
requisition
every
Sunday
morning
,
and
sometimes
oftener
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Murray
generally
think
it
sufficient
to
show
themselves
at
church
once
in
the
course
of
the
day
;
but
frequently
the
child
prefer
go
a
second
time
to
wander
about
the
ground
all
the
day
with
nothing
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
if
some
of
my
pupil
choose
to
walk
and
take
me
with
them
,
it
be
well
for
me
;
for
otherwise
my
position
in
the
carriage
be
to
be
crush
into
the
corner
farth
from
the
open
window
,
and
with
my
back
to
the
horse
:
 
a
position
which
invariably
make
me
sick
;
and
if
I
be
not
actually
oblige
to
leave
the
church
in
the
middle
of
the
service
,
my
devotion
be
disturb
with
a
feeling
of
languor
and
sickliness
,
and
the
torment
fear
of
its
become
bad
:
 
and
a
depressing
headache
be
generally
my
companion
throughout
the
day
,
which
would
otherwise
have
be
one
of
welcome
rest
,
and
holy
,
calm
enjoyment
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
very
odd
,
Miss
Grey
,
that
the
carriage
should
always
make
you
sick
:
 
<EOS>
it
never
make
me
,
"
remark
Miss
Matilda
,
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
nor
me
either
,
"
say
her
sister
;
"
but
I
dare
say
it
would
,
if
I
sit
where
she
do
 
such
a
nasty
,
horrid
place
,
Miss
Grey
;
I
wonder
how
you
can
bear
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
oblige
to
bear
it
,
since
no
choice
be
leave
me
,
"
 
I
may
have
answer
;
but
in
tenderness
for
their
feeling
I
only
reply
,
 
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
it
be
but
<EOS>
a
short
way
,
and
if
I
be
not
sick
in
church
,
I
do
not
mind
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
if
I
be
call
upon
to
give
a
description
of
the
usual
division
and
arrangement
of
the
day
,
I
should
find
it
a
very
difficult
matter
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
all
my
meal
in
the
schoolroom
with
my
pupil
,
at
such
time
as
suited
their
fancy
:
 
<EOS>
sometimes
they
would
ring
for
dinner
before
it
be
half
cooked
;
sometimes
they
would
keep
it
wait
on
the
table
for
above
an
hour
,
and
then
be
out
of
humour
because
the
potato
be
cold
,
and
<EOS>
the
gravy
cover
with
cake
of
solid
fat
;
sometimes
they
would
have
tea
at
four
;
frequently
,
they
would
storm
at
the
servant
because
it
be
not
in
precisely
at
five
;
and
when
these
order
be
obey
,
by
way
of
encouragement
to
punctuality
,
they
would
keep
it
on
the
table
till
seven
or
eight
.
  
<EOS>
Their
hour
of
study
be
manage
in
much
the
same
way
;
my
judgment
or
convenience
be
never
once
consult
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
Matilda
and
John
would
determine
"
to
get
all
the
plaguy
business
over
before
breakfast
,
"
and
send
the
maid
to
call
me
up
at
half
-
past
five
,
without
any
scruple
or
apology
;
sometimes
,
I
be
tell
to
be
ready
precisely
at
six
,
and
,
have
dress
in
a
hurry
,
come
down
to
an
empty
room
,
and
after
wait
a
long
time
in
suspense
,
discover
that
they
have
change
their
mind
,
and
be
still
in
bed
;
or
,
perhaps
,
if
it
be
a
fine
summer
morning
,
Brown
would
come
to
tell
me
that
the
young
lady
and
gentleman
have
take
a
holiday
,
and
be
go
out
;
and
then
I
be
keep
wait
for
breakfast
till
I
be
almost
ready
to
faint
:
 
they
have
fortify
themselves
with
something
before
they
go
.
  
<EOS>
often
they
would
do
their
lesson
in
the
open
air
;
which
I
have
nothing
to
say
against
:
 
except
that
I
frequently
catch
cold
by
sit
on
the
damp
grass
,
or
from
exposure
to
the
evening
dew
,
or
some
insidious
draught
,
which
seem
to
have
no
injurious
effect
on
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
quite
right
that
they
should
be
hardy
;
yet
,
surely
,
they
may
have
be
teach
some
consideration
for
other
who
be
less
so
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
not
blame
them
for
what
be
,
perhaps
,
my
own
fault
;
for
I
never
make
any
particular
objection
to
sit
where
they
please
;
foolishly
choose
to
risk
the
consequence
,
rather
than
trouble
them
for
my
convenience
.
 
<EOS>
Their
indecorous
manner
of
do
their
lesson
be
quite
as
remarkable
as
the
caprice
display
in
their
choice
of
time
and
place
.
 
<EOS>
while
receive
my
instruction
,
or
repeat
what
they
have
learn
,
they
would
lounge
upon
the
sofa
,
lie
on
the
rug
,
stretch
,
yawn
,
talk
to
each
other
,
or
look
out
of
the
window
;
whereas
,
I
could
not
so
much
as
stir
the
fire
,
or
pick
up
the
handkerchief
I
have
drop
,
without
be
rebuke
for
inattention
by
one
of
my
pupil
,
or
tell
that
"
mamma
would
not
like
me
to
be
so
careless
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
servant
,
see
in
what
little
estimation
the
governess
be
hold
by
both
parent
and
child
,
regulate
their
behaviour
by
the
same
standard
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
frequently
stand
up
for
them
,
at
the
risk
of
some
injury
to
myself
,
against
the
tyranny
and
injustice
of
their
young
master
and
mistress
;
and
I
always
endeavour
to
give
them
as
little
trouble
as
possible
:
 
but
they
entirely
neglect
my
comfort
,
despise
my
request
,
and
slight
my
direction
.
 
<EOS>
all
servant
,
I
be
convinced
,
would
not
have
do
so
;
but
domestic
in
general
,
be
ignorant
and
little
accustomed
to
reason
and
reflection
,
be
too
easily
corrupt
by
the
carelessness
and
bad
example
of
those
above
them
;
and
these
,
I
think
,
be
not
of
the
good
order
to
begin
with
.
  
<EOS>
I
sometimes
feel
myself
degrade
by
the
life
I
lead
,
and
ashamed
of
submit
to
so
many
indignity
;
and
sometimes
I
think
myself
a
fool
for
care
so
much
about
them
,
and
fear
I
must
be
sadly
want
in
christian
humility
,
or
that
charity
which
"
suffereth
long
and
be
kind
,
seeketh
not
her
own
,
be
not
easily
provoke
,
beareth
all
thing
,
endureth
all
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
,
with
time
and
patience
,
matter
begin
to
be
slightly
ameliorate
:
 
slowly
,
it
be
true
,
and
almost
imperceptibly
;
but
I
get
rid
of
my
male
pupil
(
that
be
no
trifling
advantage
)
,
and
the
girl
,
as
I
intimate
before
concern
one
of
them
,
become
a
little
less
insolent
,
and
begin
to
show
some
symptom
of
esteem
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Grey
be
a
queer
creature
:
 
<EOS>
she
never
flatter
,
and
do
not
praise
them
half
enough
;
but
whenever
she
do
speak
favourably
of
them
,
or
anything
belong
to
them
,
they
could
be
quite
sure
her
approbation
be
sincere
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
very
obliging
,
quiet
,
and
peaceable
in
the
main
,
but
there
be
some
thing
that
put
her
out
of
temper
:
 
<EOS>
they
do
not
much
care
for
that
,
to
be
sure
,
but
still
it
be
well
to
keep
her
in
tune
;
as
when
she
be
in
a
good
humour
she
would
talk
to
them
,
and
be
very
agreeable
and
amusing
sometimes
,
in
her
way
;
which
be
quite
different
to
mamma
's
,
but
still
very
well
for
a
change
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
her
own
opinion
on
every
subject
,
and
keep
steadily
to
them
 
very
tiresome
opinion
they
often
be
;
as
she
be
always
think
of
what
be
right
and
what
be
wrong
,
and
have
a
strange
reverence
for
matter
connect
with
religion
,
and
an
unaccountable
like
to
good
people
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
"
come
out
"
  
<EOS>
at
eighteen
,
Miss
Murray
be
to
emerge
from
the
quiet
obscurity
of
the
schoolroom
into
the
full
blaze
of
the
fashionable
world
 
as
much
of
it
,
at
least
,
as
could
be
have
out
of
London
;
for
her
papa
could
not
be
persuade
to
leave
his
rural
pleasure
and
pursuit
,
even
for
a
few
week
'
residence
in
town
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
to
make
her
debut
on
the
third
of
January
,
at
a
magnificent
ball
,
which
her
mamma

to
give
to
all
the
nobility

twenty

round

one
evening

a

long

extremely
interesting
letter

I
have
just

at
in

more
amusing

She
seat
herself
on
the
low
stool
at
my
foot

suppress
a

vexation

begin

fold
up
the

the

,
above
all

me

splendid
new
dress

I
shall
be
so
charming
,
you
will
be
ready

worship
me
 
<EOS>
you
really
must
stay

<EOS>

I
should
like
to
see
you
very
much
;
but
I
shall
have
many
opportunity
of
see
you
equally
charming
,
on
the
occasion
of
some
of
the
numberless
ball
and
party
that
be
to
be
,
and
I
can
not
disappoint
my
friend

postpone
my
return
so
long

<EOS>

<EOS>

oh

never

your

tell

"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
to
say
the
truth
,
it
would
be
a
disappointment
to
myself
:

I
long
to
see
them
as
much
as
they
to
see
me
 
perhaps
more

"
  
<EOS>
"

well
,

it
be
such
a
short
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
nearly
a
fortnight
by
my
computation
;
and
,
besides
,
I
can
not
bear
the
thought
of
a
Christmas
spend
from
home
:
 
and
,
moreover
,
my
sister
be
go
to
be
marry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
she
 
when
?
"
  
"
not
till
next
month
;

I
want
to
be
there
to
assist
her
in
make
preparation
,

to
make
the
good
of
her
company
while
we
have
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
you
tell
me
before
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
get
the
news
in
this
letter

which
you
stigmatize
as
dull

stupid

will
not
let
me
read

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
to
whom
be
she
to
be
marry

to
Mr.
Richardson

the
vicar
of
a
neighbour
parish

rich

no

"
  
<EOS>

no

"
  
<EOS>

oh

<EOS>
what
a

<EOS>
what
sort

it

<EOS>
"
a
quiet
little
vicarage

with
an
ivy

porch

an
old

garden

"
  
"
oh

stop

you
will
make
me
sick

<EOS>
how
CAN
she

I
expect
she
will
not

be
able
to
bear
it

to

very
happy

<EOS>
You
do
not
ask
me
if
Mr.
Richardson
be
a

wise

I
could
have
answer

yes

Mary

mistaken

miserable

<EOS>
how
can
she
think
of
spend
her
life
there

coope
up
with
that
nasty
old
man

no
hope
of
change

<EOS>

He
be
not
old
:
 
<EOS>
he
be
only
six
or
seven
and
thirty

and
she
herself
be
twenty

eight

as

"
<EOS>
oh

that
be
well

I

I
dare

she

then

that
will
be
no
great
hardship

as
she
have
do
it
before

will
she

soup

I

You

in

by
show

Brown
say

be
sure
no

I
may

allow

vain

know
you

me
a
shocking

conceited

frivolous
girl

then
,
you
know

I
do
not

it
all

personal
attraction

I
give
some
praise

some
to

exquisitely
lovely
dress

it
to

morrow
 
white
gauze

pink
satin

large
pearl

I
have
no

you
look

delight

very
much

oh
,
no

<EOS>
not
that
alone

,
then

I
be
so
much
admired

I
make
so
many
conquest
in
that
one
night
 
<EOS>
you
would
be
astonish
to
hear

what
good
will
they
do
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
good
!
 
<EOS>
think
of
any
woman
ask
that
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
should
think
one
conquest
would
be
enough
;
and
too
much
,
unless
the
subjugation
be
mutual
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
but
you
know
I
never
agree
with
you
on
those
point
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
wait
a
bit
,
and
I
will
tell
you
my
principal
admirer
 
<EOS>
those
who
make
themselves
very
conspicuous
that
night
and
after
:
 
for
<EOS>
I
have
be
to
two
party
since
.
 
<EOS>
unfortunately
the
two
nobleman
,
Lord
G
#
#
#
#
and
Lord
F
#
#
#
#
,
be
married
,
or
I
may
have
condescend
to
be
particularly
gracious
to
them
;
as
it
be
,
I
do
not
:
 
though
Lord
F
#
#
#
#
,
who
hate
his
wife
,
be
evidently
much
strike
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
ask
me
to
dance
with
him
twice
 
<EOS>
he
be
a
charming
dancer
,
by
-
the-
<EOS>
by
,
and
so
be
I
:
 
<EOS>
you
can
not
think
how
well
I
do
 
<EOS>
I
be
astonish
at
myself
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
be
very
complimentary
too
 
rather
too
much
so
in
fact
 
<EOS>
and
I
think
proper
to
be
a
little
haughty
and
repellent
;
but
I
have
the
pleasure
of
see
his
nasty
,
cross
wife
ready
to
perish
with
spite
and
vexation
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
,
Miss
Murray
!
<EOS>
you
do
not
mean
to
say
that
such
a
thing
could
really
give
you
pleasure
?
 
<EOS>
however
cross
or
"
  
"
well
,
I
know
it
be
very
wrong
;
 
but
never
mind
!
 
<EOS>
I
mean
to
be
good
some
time
 
<EOS>
only
do
not
preach
now
,
there
be
a
good
creature
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
tell
you
half
yet
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
see
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
tell
you
how
many
unmistakeable
admirer
I
have
:
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Ashby
be
one
,
 
Sir
Hugh
Meltham
and
Sir
Broadley
Wilson
be
old
codger
,
only
fit
companion
for
papa
and
mamma
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
be
young
,
rich
,
and
gay
;
but
an
ugly
beast
,
nevertheless
:
 
however
<EOS>
,
mamma
say
I
should
not
mind
that
after
a
few
month
"
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
there
be
Henry
Meltham
,
Sir
Hugh
's
young
son
;
rather
good
-
look
,
and
a
pleasant
fellow
to
flirt
with
:
 
but
be
a
young
son
,
that
be
all
he
be
good
for
;
then
there
be
young
Mr.
Green
,
rich
enough
,
but
of
no
family
,
and
a
great
stupid
fellow
,
a
mere
country
booby
!
<EOS>
and
then
,
our
good
rector
,
Mr.
Hatfield
:
 
an
HUMBLE
admirer
he
ought
to
consider
himself
;
but
I
fear
he
have
forget
to
number
humility
among
his
stock
of
christian
virtue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
Mr.
Hatfield
at
the
ball
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
to
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
he
be
too
good
to
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
be
may
consider
it
unclerical
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
by
no
means
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
profane
his
cloth
by
dance
;
but
it
be
with
difficulty
he
could
refrain
,
poor
man
:
 
<EOS>
he
look
as
if
he
be
die
to
ask
my
hand
just
for
one
set
;
and
 
oh
!
<EOS>
by
-
the

by
 
<EOS>
he
be
get
a
new
curate

<EOS>
that
seedy
old

<EOS>
Mr.
Bligh
have
get
his
long

wish

for
living
at
last

and
be

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
be
the
new
one
like
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
SUCH
a
beast
!
 
<EOS>
Weston
his
name
be

<EOS>
I
can
give
you
his
description
in
three
word
 
an
insensate

ugly

stupid
blockhead

<EOS>
that
be
four
,
but
no

enough
of
him
now

"
  
<EOS>
then
she
return
to
the
ball
,
and
give
me
a
further
account
of
her
deportment
there
,
and
at
the
several
party
she

attend

further
particular
respect
Sir
Thomas
Ashby

Messrs.
Meltham
,
Green
,

Hatfield
,
and
the
ineffaceable
impression
she

work
upon

well

which
of

you
like
best

most

<EOS>
"
no

I

Harry

the

most
amusing

Mr.
Hatfield
the
clever
,
Sir
Thomas
the
wickedest

the

the

I

to
have
any

be
Sir
Thomas
Ashby

"
  
"
surely
not
,
if
he
be
so
wicked
,
and
if
you
dislike
him

"
oh
,
I
do
not
mind
his
be
wicked
:
 
<EOS>
he
be
all
the
well
for
that

as
for
dislike
him
 
I
should
not
greatly
object
to
be
Lady
Ashby

if
I
must
marry

<EOS>
but
if
I
could
be
always
young

I
would
be
always
single

<EOS>
I
should
like
to
enjoy
myself
thoroughly
,
and
coquet
with
all
the
world
,
till
I
be
on
the
verge
of
be
call
an
old
maid

then
,
to
escape
the
infamy
of
that

have
make
ten
thousand
conquest

to
break
all
their
heart
save
one
,
by

some
high

rich

indulgent
husband

whom

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
as
long
as
you
entertain
these
view

keep
single
by
all

never

at

the

<EOS>
the
CHURCH
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
Miss
Grey
,
what
do
you
think
of
the
new
curate
?
"
ask
Miss
Murray
,
on
our
return
from
church
the
Sunday
after
the
recommencement
of
our
duty
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
scarcely
tell
,
"
be
my
reply
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
even
hear
him
preach
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
you
see
him
,
do
not
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
but
I
can
not
pretend
to
judge
of
a
man
's
character
by
a
single
cursory
glance
at
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
be
not
he
ugly
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
do
not
strike
me
as
be
particularly
so
;
I
do
not
dislike
that
cast
of
countenance
:
 
but
the
only
thing
I
particularly
notice
about
him
be
his
style
of
reading
;
which
appear
to
me
good
 
infinitely
better
,
at
least
,
than
Mr.
Hatfield
's
.
 
<EOS>
He
read
the
lesson
as
if
he
be
bent
on
give
full
effect
to
every
passage
;
it
seem
as
if
the
most
careless
person
could
not
have
help
attend
,
nor
the
most
ignorant
have
fail
to
understand
;
and
the
prayer
he
read
as
if
he
be
not
read
at
all
,
but
pray
earnestly
and
sincerely
from
his
own
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
that
be
all
he
be
good
for
:
 
he
can
plod
through
the
service
well
enough
;
but
he
have
not
a
single
idea
beyond
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
know
perfectly
well
;
I
be
an
excellent
judge
in
such
matter
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
see
how
he
go
out
of
church
?
<EOS>
stump
along
 
as
if
there
be
nobody
there
<EOS>
but
himself
 
never
look
to
the
right
hand
or
the
left
,
and
evidently
think
of
nothing
but
just
get
out
of
the
church
,
and
,
perhaps
,
home
to
his
dinner
:
 
<EOS>
his
great
stupid
head
could
contain
no
other
idea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
would
have
have
him
cast
a
glance
into
the
squire
's
pew
,
"
say
I
,
laugh
at
the
vehemence
of
her
hostility
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
should
have
be
highly
indignant
if
he
have
dare
to
do
such
a
thing
!
"
<EOS>
reply
she
,
haughtily
toss
her
head
;
then
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
,
she
add
"
<EOS>
well
,
well
!
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
be
good
enough
for
his
place
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
glad
I
be
not
dependent
on
him
for
amusement
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
see
how
Mr.
Hatfield
hurry
out
to
get
a
bow
from
me
,
and
be
in
time
to
put
us
into
the
carriage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
answer
I
;
internally
add
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
think
it
somewhat
derogatory
to
his
dignity
as
a
clergyman
to
come
fly
from
the
pulpit
in
such
eager
haste
to
shake
hand
with
the
squire
,
and
hand
his
wife
and
daughter
into
their
carriage
:
 
and
,
moreover
,
I
owe
him
a
grudge
for
nearly
shut
me
out
of
it
"
;
for
,
in
fact
,
though
I
be
stand
before
his
face
,
close
beside
the
carriage
step
,
wait
to
get
in
,
he
would
persist
in
put
them
up
and
close
the
door
,
till
one
of
the
family
stop
him
by
call
out
that
the
governess
be
not
in
yet
;
then
,
without
a
word
of
apology
<EOS>
,
he
depart
,
wish
them
good
-
morning
,
and
leave
the
footman
to
finish
the
business
.
  
<EOS>
Nota
bene

<EOS>
Mr.

never
speak
to

<EOS>
Miss
Murray
order
the
carriage
again
,
in
the
afternoon
,
for
herself
and
her
sister
:
 
<EOS>
she
say
it
be
too
cold
for
them
to
enjoy
themselves
in
the
garden
;
and
besides
,
she
believe
Harry
Meltham
would
be
at
church
.
 
<EOS>
"
for
,
"
say
she
,
smile
slyly
at
her
own
fair
image
in
the
glass
,
"
he
have
be
a
most
exemplary
attendant
at
church
these
last
few
Sundays
:
 
<EOS>
you
would
think
he
be
quite
a
good
Christian
.
 
<EOS>
and
you
may
go
with
us
,
Miss
Grey
:
 
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
see
him
;
he
be
so
greatly
improve
since
he
return
from
abroad
 
<EOS>
you
can
not
think
!
 
<EOS>
and
besides
,
then
you
will
have
an
opportunity
of
see
the
beautiful
Mr.
Weston
again
,
and
of
hear
him
preach
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
hear
him
preach
,
and
be
decidedly
pleased
with
the
evangelical
truth
of
his
doctrine
,
as
well
as
the
earnest
simplicity
of
his
manner
,
and
the
clearness
and
force
of
his
style
.
<EOS>
It
be
truly
refreshing
to
hear
such
a
sermon
,
after
be
so
long
accustomed
to
the
dry
,
prosy
discourse
of
the
former
curate
,
and
the
still
less
edifying
harangue
of
the
rector
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Hatfield
would
come
sailing
up
the
aisle
,
or
rather
sweeping
along
like
a
whirlwind
,
with
his
rich
silk
gown
fly
behind
him
and
rustle
against
the
pew
door
,
mount
the
pulpit
like
a
conqueror
ascend
his
triumphal
car
;
then
,
sink
on
the
velvet
cushion
in
an
attitude
of
study
grace
,
remain
in
silent
prostration
for
a
certain
time
;
then
mutter
over
a
Collect
,
and
gabble
through
the
Lord
's
Prayer
,
rise
,
draw
off
one
bright
lavender
glove
,
to
give
the
congregation
the
benefit
of
his
sparkling
ring
,
lightly
pass
his
finger
through
his
well
-
curl
hair
,
flourish
a
cambric
handkerchief
,
recite
a
very
short
passage
,
or
,
perhaps
,
a
mere
phrase
of
scripture
,
as
a
head
-
piece
to
his
discourse
,
and
,
finally
,
deliver
a
composition
which
,
as
a
composition
,
may
be
consider
good
,
though
far
too
studied
and
too
artificial
to
be
pleasing
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
the
proposition
be
well
lay
down
,
the
argument
logically
conduct
;
and
<EOS>
yet
,
it
be
sometimes
hard
to
listen
quietly
throughout
,
without
some
slight
demonstration
of
disapproval
or
impatience
.
  
<EOS>
His
favourite
subject
be
church
discipline
,
rite
and
ceremony
,
apostolical
succession
,
the
duty
of
reverence
and
obedience
to
the
clergy
,
the
atrocious
criminality
of
dissent
,
the
absolute
necessity
of
observe
all
the
form
of
godliness
,
the
reprehensible
presumption
of
individual
who
attempt
to
think
for
themselves
in
matter
connect
with
religion
,
or
to
be
guide
by
their
own
interpretation
of
scripture
,
and
,
occasionally
(
to
please
his
wealthy
parishioner
)
<EOS>
the
necessity
of
deferential
obedience
from
the
poor
to
the
rich
 
support
his
maxim
and
exhortation
throughout
with
quotation
from
the
father
:
 
with
whom
he
appear
to
be
far
better
acquaint
than
with
the
Apostles
and
evangelist
,
and
whose
importance
he
seem
to
consider
at
least
equal
to
theirs
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
and
then
he
give
us
a
sermon
of
a
different
order
 
what
some
would
call
a
very
good
one
;
but
sunless
and
severe
:
 
represent
the
Deity
as
a
terrible
taskmaster
rather
than
a
benevolent
father
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
as
I
listen
,
I
feel
inclined
to
think
the
man
be
sincere
in
all
he
say
:
 
he
must
have
change
his
view
,
and
become
decidedly
religious
,
gloomy
and
austere
,
yet
still
devout
.
 
<EOS>
but
such
illusion
be
usually
dissipate
,
on
come
out
of
church
,
by
hear
his
voice
in
jocund
colloquy
with
some
of
the
Melthams
or
Greens
,
or
,
perhaps
<EOS>
,
the
Murrays
themselves
;
probably
laugh
at
his
own
sermon
,
and
hope
that
he
have
give
the
rascally
people
something
to
think
about
;
perchance
,
exult
in
the
thought
that
old
Betty
Holmes
would
now
lay
aside
the
sinful
indulgence
of
her
pipe
,
which
have
be
her
daily
solace
for
upward
of
thirty
year
:
 
that
George
Higgins
would
be
frighten
out
of
his
Sabbath
evening
walk
,
and
Thomas
Jackson
would
be
sorely
trouble
in
his
conscience
,
and
shake
in
his
sure
and
certain
hope
of
a
joyful
resurrection
at
the
last
day
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
I
could
not
but
conclude
that
Mr.
Hatfield
be
one
of
those
who
"
bind
heavy
burden
,
and
grievous
to
be
bear
,
and
lie
them
upon
man
's
shoulder
,
while
they
themselves
will
not
move
them
with
one
of
their
finger
"
;
and
who
"
make
the
word
of
God
of
none
effect
by
their
tradition
,
teach
for
doctrine
the
commandment
of
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
well
pleased
to
observe
that
the
new
curate
resemble
him
,
as
far
as
I
could
see
,
in
none
of
these
particular
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Miss
Grey
,
what
do
you
think
of
him
now
?
"
say
Miss
Murray
,
as
we
take
our
place
in
the
carriage
after
service
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
harm
still
,
"
reply
i.
  
"
no
harm
!
"
<EOS>
repeat
she
in
amazement
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
I
think
no
bad
of
him
than
I
do
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
bad
!
 
<EOS>
I
should
think
not
indeed
 
quite
the
contrary
!
 
<EOS>
be
he
not
greatly
improve
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
;
very
much
indeed
,
"
reply
I
;
for
I
have
now
discover
that
it
be
Harry
Meltham
she
mean
,
not
Mr.
Weston
.
 
<EOS>
that
gentleman
have
eagerly
come
forward
to
speak
to
the
young
lady
:
 
a
thing
he
would
hardly
have
venture
to
do
have
their
mother
be
present
;
he
have
likewise
politely
hand
them
into
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
attempt
to
shut
me
out
,
like
Mr.
Hatfield
;
neither
,
of
course
,
have
he
offer
me
his
assistance
<EOS>
(
I
should
not
have
accept
it
,
if
he
have
)
,
but
as
long
as
the
door
remain
open
he
have
stand
smirk
and
chat
with
them
,
and
then
lift
his
hat
and
depart
to
his
own
abode
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
scarcely
notice
him
all
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
My
companion
,
however
,
have
be
more
observant
;
and
,
as
we
roll
along
,
they
discuss
between
them
not
only
his
look
,
word
,
and
action
,
but
every
feature
of
his
face
,
and
every
article
of
his
apparel
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
have
him
all
to
yourself
,
Rosalie
,
"
say
Miss
Matilda
at
the
close
of
this
discussion
;
<EOS>
"
I
like
him
:
 
<EOS>
I
know
he
would
make
a
nice
,
jolly
companion
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
you
be
quite
welcome
to
him
,
Matilda
,
"
reply
her
sister
,
in
a
tone
of
affected
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
be
sure
,
"
continue
the
other
,
"
he
admire
me
quite
as
much
as
he
do
you
;
do
not
he
,
Miss
Grey
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
;
I
be
not
acquaint
with
his
sentiment
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
he
do
though
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Matilda
!
<EOS>
nobody
will
ever
admire
you
till
you
get
rid
of
your
rough

awkward
manner

oh

stuff

<EOS>
Harry
Meltham
like
such
manner

<EOS>

well

use

shocking
expression

I
be
sure
no

will
ever
venture

come

<EOS>
really

you

do
so

I

it

Miss
Murray

"
  
<EOS>

and
you
be
quite
mistaken
,
Matilda

in

I
assure
you
he
do
nothing

<EOS>
Matilda
be
begin
an
angry
reply
;
but
,
happily
,
our
journey
be
now
at
an
end
;
and
the
contention
be
cut
short
by
the
footman
open
the
carriage
-
door
,
and
let
down
the
step
for
our
descent
.
    
<EOS>
the
cottager
  
<EOS>
as
I
have
now
only
one
regular
pupil
 
though
she
contrive
to
give
me
as
much
trouble
as
three
or
four
ordinary
one
,
and
though
her
sister
still
take
lesson
in
german
and
draw
 
I
have
considerably
more
time
at
my
own
disposal
than
I
have
ever
be
bless
with
before
,
since
I
have
take
upon
me
the
governess
's
yoke
;
which
time
I
devote
partly
to
correspondence
with
my
friend
,
partly
to
reading
,
study
,
and
the
practice
of
music
,
singing
,
&
c.
,
partly
to
wander
in
the
ground
or
adjacent
field
,
with
my
pupil
if
they
want
me
,
alone
if
they
do
not
.
  
<EOS>
often
,
when
they
have
no
more
agreeable
occupation
at
hand
,
the
Misses
Murray
would
amuse
themselves
with
visit
the
poor
cottager
on
their
father
's
estate
,
to
receive
their
flattering
homage
,
or
to
hear
the
old
story
or
gossip
news
of
the
garrulous
old
woman
;
or
,
perhaps
,
to
enjoy
the
purer
pleasure
of
make
the
poor
people
happy
with
their
cheer
presence
and
their
occasional
gift
,
so
easily
bestow
,
so
thankfully
receive
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
I
be
call
upon
to
accompany
one
or
both
of
the
sister
in
these
visit
;
and
sometimes
I
be
desire
to
go
alone
,
to
fulfil
some
promise
which
they
have
be
more
ready
to
make
than
to
perform
;
to
carry
some
small
donation
,
or
read
to
one
who
be
sick
or
seriously
dispose
:
 
and
thus
I
make
a
few
acquaintance
among
the
cottager
;
and
,
occasionally
,
I
go
to
see
them
on
my
own
account
.
  
<EOS>
I
generally
have
more
satisfaction
in
go
alone
than
with
either
of
the
young
lady
;
for
they
,
chiefly
owe
to
their
defective
education
,
comport
themselves
towards
their
inferior
in
a
manner
that
be
highly
disagreeable
for
me
to
witness
.
 
<EOS>
They
never
,
in
thought
,
exchange
place
with
them
;
and
,
consequently
,
have
no
consideration
for
their
feeling
,
regard
them
as
an
order
of
being
entirely
different
from
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
watch
the
poor
creature
at
their
meal
,
make
uncivil
remark
about
their
food
,
and
their
manner
of
eat
;
they
would
laugh
at
their
simple
notion
and
provincial
expression
,
till
some
of
them
scarcely
durst
venture
to
speak
;
they
would
call
the
grave
elderly
man
and
woman
old
fool
and
silly
old
blockhead
to
their
face
:
 
and
all
this
without
mean
to
offend
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
see
that
the
people
be
often
hurt
and
annoy
by
such
conduct
,
though
their
fear
of
the
"
grand
lady
"
prevent
them
from
testify
any
resentment
;
but
they
never
perceive
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
think
that
,
as
these
cottager
be
poor
and
untaught
,
they
must
be
stupid
and
brutish
;
and
as
long
as
they
,
their
superior
,
condescend
to
talk
to
them
,
and
to
give
them
shilling
and
half
-
crown
,
or
article
of
clothing
,
they
have
a
right
to
amuse
themselves
,
even
at
their
expense
;
and
the
people
must
adore
them
as
angel
of
light
,
condescend
to
minister
to
their
necessity
,
and
enlighten
their
humble
dwelling
.
  
<EOS>
I
make
many
and
various
attempt
to
deliver
my
pupil
from
these
delusive
notion
without
alarm
their
pride
 
which
be
easily
offend
,
and
not
soon
appease
 
but
with
little
apparent
result
;
and
I
know
not
which
be
the
more
reprehensible
of
the
two
:
Matilda
be
more
rude
and
boisterous
;
but
from
Rosalie
's
womanly
age
and
lady
-
like
exterior
well
thing
be
expect
:
 
yet
she
be
as
provokingly
careless
and
inconsiderate
as
a
giddy
child
of
twelve
.
  
<EOS>
one
bright
day
in
the
last
week
of
February
,
I
be
walk
in
the
park
,
enjoy
the
threefold
luxury
of
solitude
,
a
book
,
and
pleasant
weather
;
for
Miss
Matilda
have
set
out
on
her
daily
ride
,
and
Miss
Murray
be
go
in
the
carriage
with
her
mamma
to
pay
some
morning
call
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
strike
me
that
I
ought
to
leave
these
selfish
pleasure
,
and
the
park
with
its
glorious
canopy
of
bright
blue
sky
,
the
west
wind
sound
through
its
yet
leafless
branch
,
the
snow
-
wreath
still
linger
in
its
hollow
,
but
melt
fast
beneath
the
sun
,
and
the
graceful
deer
browse
on
its
moist
herbage
already
assume
the
freshness
and
verdure
of
spring
 
and
go
to
the
cottage
of
one
Nancy
Brown
,
a
widow
,
whose
son
be
at
work
all
day
in
the
field
,
and
who
be
afflict
with
an
inflammation
in
the
eye
;
which
have
for
some
time
incapacitate
her
from
read
:
 
to
her
own
great
grief
,
for
she
be
a
woman
of
a
serious
,
thoughtful
turn
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
accordingly
go
,
and
find
her
alone
,
as
usual
,
in
her
little
,
close
,
dark
cottage
,
redolent
of
smoke
and
confine
air
,
but
as
tidy
and
clean
as
she
could
make
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
seat
beside
her
little
fire
(
consist
of
a
few
red
cinder
and
a
bit
of
stick
)
,
busily
knit
,
with
a
small
sackcloth
cushion
at
her
foot
,
place
for
the
accommodation
of
her
gentle
friend
the
cat
,
who
be
seat
thereon
,
with
her
long
tail
half
encircle
her
velvet
paw
,
and
her
half
-
close
eye
dreamily
gaze
on
the
low
,
crooked
fender
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Nancy

<EOS>

reply
she
,
rise
to
welcome
me
with
a
contented
smile
;
<EOS>
which
I
be
glad
to
see
,
for
Nancy
have
be
somewhat
afflict
with
religious
melancholy
.
 
<EOS>
I
congratulate
her
upon
the
change
.
 
<EOS>
She
agree
that
it
be
a
great
blessing
,
and
express
herself
"
right
down
thankful
for
it
"
;
add
,
"
if
it
please
God
to
spare
my
sight
,
and
make
me
so
as
I
can
read
my
Bible
again

,
I
think
I
shall
be
as
happy
as
a
queen

<EOS>
"
I
hope
He
will

Nancy

reply
I
;
"
and
,
meantime
,
I
will
come
and
read
to
you
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
when
I
have
a
little
time
to
spare
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
expression
of
grateful
pleasure
,
the
poor
woman
move
to
get
me
a
chair
;
but
,
as
I
save
her
the
trouble
,
she
busy
herself
with
stir
the
fire
,
and
add
a
few
more
stick
to
the
decay
ember
;
and
then
,
take
her
well
-
use
Bible
from
the
shelf
,
dust
it
carefully
,
and
give
it
me
.
 
<EOS>
on
my
asking
if
there
be
any
particular
part
she
should
like
me
to
read
,
she
answer
     
"
well
,
Miss
Grey
,
if
it
be
all
the
same
to
you
,
I
should
like
to
hear
that
chapter
in
the
First
Epistle
of
St.
John
,
that
say
,
"
God
be
love
,
and
he
that
dwelleth
in
love
dwelleth
in
God
,
and
God
in
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
with
a
little
searching
,
I
find
these
word
in
the
fourth
chapter
.
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
the
seventh
verse
she
interrupt
me
,
and
,
with
needless
apology
for
such
a
liberty
,
desire
me
to
read
it
very
slowly
,
that
she
may
take
it
all
in
,
and
dwell
on
every
word
;
hope
I
would
excuse
her
,
as
she
be
but
a
"
simple
body
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
wise
person
,
"
I
reply
,
"
may
think
over
each
of
these
verse
for
an
hour
,
and
be
all
the
well
for
it
;
and
I
would
rather
read
them
slowly
than
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
I
finish
the
chapter
as
slowly
as
need
be
,
and
at
the
same
time
as
impressively
as
I
could
;
my
auditor
listen
most
attentively
all
the
while
,
and
sincerely
thank
me
when
I
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
still
about
half
a
minute
to
give
her
time
to
reflect
upon
it
;
when
,
somewhat
to
my
surprise
,
she
break
the
pause
by
ask
me
how
I
like
Mr.
Weston
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
I
reply
,
a
little
startle
by
the
suddenness
of
the
question
;
"
I
think
he
preach
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
he
do
so
;
and
talk
well
too

"
  
<EOS>
"
do
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
do
.
 
<EOS>
maybe
,
you
have
not
see
him
 
not
to
talk
to
him
much
,
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
never
see
any
one
to
talk
to
 
except
the
young
lady
of
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
;
they
be
nice
,
kind
young
lady
;
but
they
can
not
talk
as
he
do

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
he
come
to
see
you
,
Nancy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
do
,
Miss
;
and
i'se
thankful
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
to
see
all
us
poor
body
<EOS>
a
deal
ofter
nor
Maister
Bligh

or
th

an
'
<EOS>
it
be
well
<EOS>
he
do
,
for
he
be
always
welcome
:
 
<EOS>
we
can
not
say
as
much
for
th
'
<EOS>
rector
 
<EOS>
there
be
"
at
say
they
be
fair
fear
on
him
.
<EOS>
when
he
come
into
a
house
,
they
say
he
be
sure
to
find
summut
wrong
,
and
begin
a
-
call
'em
as
soon
as
he
cross
th
'
doorstun
:
<EOS>
but
maybe
he
think
it
his
duty
like
to
tell
'em
what
be
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
and
very
oft
he
come
o
'
purpose
to
reprove
folk
for
not
come
to
church
,
or
not
kneel
an
'
standing
when
other
folk
do
,
or
go
to
the
Methody
chapel
,
or
summut
o
'
<EOS>
that
sort
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
say
"
at
he
ever
fund
much
fault
wi

me

<EOS>
He
come
to
see
me
once
or
twice
<EOS>
,
afore
Maister
Weston
come
,
when
I
be
so
ill
troubled
in
my
mind
;
and
as
I
have
only
very
poor
health
besides
,
I
make
bold
to
send
for
him
 
<EOS>
and
he
come
right
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sore
distressed
<EOS>
,
Miss
Grey
 
thank
God
,
it
be
owere
now
 
<EOS>
but
when
I
take
my
Bible
,
I
could
get
no
comfort
of
it
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
that
very
chapter
"
at
you
have
just
be
read
trouble
me
as
much
as
aught
 
"
<EOS>
He
that
loveth
<EOS>
not
,
knoweth
not
God
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
seem
fearsome
to
me
;
for
I
feel
that
I
love
neither
God
nor
man
as
I
should
do
,
and
could
not
,
if
I
try
ever
so
.
 
<EOS>
and
th
'
chapter
afore
,
where
it
say
,
 
"
He
that
be
bear
of
God
can
not
commit
sin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
another
place
where
it
say
<EOS>
,
 
"
love
be
the
fulfilling
of
the
Law
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
many
,
many
other
,
Miss
:
 
<EOS>
I
should
fair
weary
you
out
,
if
I
be
to
tell
them
all

<EOS>
but
all
seem
to
condemn
me
,
and
to
show
me
"
at
I
be
not
in
the
right
way
;
and
as
I
know
not
how
to
get
into
it
,
I
send
our
Bill
to
beg
Maister
Hatfield
to
be
as
kind
as
look
in
on
me
some
day
and
when
he
come
,
I
tell
him
all
my
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
what
do
he
say
,
Nancy
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
Miss
,
he
seem
to
scorn
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
be
mista'en
 
<EOS>
but
he
like
give
a
sort
of
a
whistle
,
and
<EOS>
I
see
a
bit
of
a
smile
on
his
face
;
and
he
say
,
"
oh
,
it
be
all
stuff
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
be
among
the
Methodists
,
my
good
woman
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
I
tell
him
<EOS>
I
would
never
be
near
the
Methodies
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
say
,
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
must
come
to
church
,
where
you
will
hear
the
scripture
properly
explain
,
instead
of
sit
pore
over
your
Bible
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
tell
him
I
always
use
come
to
church
when
I
have
my
health
;
but
this
very
cold
winter
weather
I
hardly
durst
venture
so
far
 
<EOS>
and
me
<EOS>
so
bad
<EOS>
wi
'
th
'
rheumatic
and
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
he
say
,
"
It
will
do
your
rheumatiz
good
to
hobble
to
church
:
there
be
nothing
like
exercise
for
the
rheumatiz

<EOS>
You
can
walk
about
the
house
well
enough
;
why
can
not
you
walk
to
church
?
 
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
be
get
too
fond
of
your
ease

<EOS>
It
be
always
easy
to
find
excuse
for
shirk
one
's
duty

<EOS>
"
but
then
,
you
know
,
Miss
Grey
,
it
be
not
so
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
tell
him
I
would
try
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
please
,
sir

say
I
,
"
if
I
do
go
to
church

what
the
well
shall
I
be
?
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
have
my
sin
blot
out

to
feel
that
they
be
remember
no
more
against
me
,
and
that
the
love
of
God
be
shed
abroad
in
my
heart
;
and
if
I
can
get
no
good
by
read
my

my

what
good
shall

Howsever
,
I
follere
his
advice

<EOS>
I
think
he
mean
it
all
for
th
'
good
,
though
he
have
a
queer
way
with
him

<EOS>
but
you

Miss

he
be
rich
<EOS>
an

,
and
such
like
can
not
right
understand
the
thought
of
a

,
howsever

I
do
my
good
to

maybe
I
be

wi

"
  
<EOS>

"
well
,
my
rheumatiz
get
well
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
wi
'
go
to
church
or
not
,
but
<EOS>
one
frosty
Sunday
I
get
this
cold
<EOS>
i
'
my
eye
.
<EOS>
th
'
inflammation
do
not
come
on
all
at
once
like
,
but
bit
by
bit
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
go
to
tell
you
about
my
eye
,
I
be
talk
about
my
trouble
o
'
mind
;
 
and
to
tell
the
truth
,
Miss
Grey
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
think
it
be
anyways
ease
by
come
to
church
 
nought
to
speak
on
,
at
least
:
 
<EOS>
I
like
get
my
health
better
;
but
that
do
not
mend
my
soul
.
 
<EOS>
I
hearken
and
hearken
the
minister
,
and
read
an
'
read
at
my
prayer
-
book
;
but
it
be
all
like
sound
brass
and
a
tinkle
cymbal
:
 
the
sermon
I
could
not
understand
,
an
'
th
'
prayer
-
book
only
serve
to
show
me
how
wicked
I
be
,
that
I
could
read
such
good
word
<EOS>
an
'
never
be
no
well
for
it
,
and
often
feel
it
a
sore
labour
an
'
a
heavy
task
beside
,
instead
of
a
blessing
and
a
privilege
as
all
good
Christians
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
like
as
all
be
barren
an
'
dark
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
them
dreadful
word
,
"
many
shall
seek
to
enter
in
,
and
shall
not
be
able
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
like
<EOS>
as
they
fair
dry
up
my
sperrit
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
one
Sunday
,
when
Maister
Hatfield
give
out
about
the
sacrament
,
I
notice
where
he
say
,
"
if
there
be
any
of
you
that
can
not
quiet
his
own
conscience
,
but
requireth
further
comfort
or
counsel
,
let
him
come
to
me
,
or
some
other
discreet
and
learn
minister
of
God
's
word
,
and
open
his
grief
!
"
 
<EOS>
so
next
Sunday
morning
,
afore
service
,
I
just
look
into
the
vestry
,
an
'
begin
a
-
talk
to
th
'
rector
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
could
fashion
to
take
such
a
liberty
,
but
I
think
when
my
soul
be
at
stake
I
should
not
stick
at
a
trifle
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
say
he
have
not
time
to
attend
to
me
then
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
and
,
indeed
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
but
what
I
have
say
before
.
 
<EOS>
take
the
sacrament
,
of
course
,
and
go
on
do
your
duty
;
and
if
that
will
not
serve
you
,
nothing
will
.
 
<EOS>
so
do
not
bother
me
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
then
,
I
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
hear
Maister
Weston
 
<EOS>
Maister
Weston
be
there
,
Miss
 
this
be
his
first
Sunday
at
Horton
,
you
know
,
an
'
he
be
i
'
th
'
vestry
in
his
surplice
,
help
th
'
rector
on
with
his
gown
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
Nancy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
hear
him
ask
Maister
Hatfield
who
I
be
,
an
'
he
say
,
"
oh
,
she
be
a
canting
old
fool
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
I
be
very
ill
grieved
,
Miss
Grey
;
but
I
go
to
my
seat
,
and
I
try
to
do
my
duty
as
aforetime
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
like
get
no
peace
.
 
<EOS>
an
'
I
even
take
the
sacrament
;
but
I
feel
as
though
I
be
eat
and
drink
to
my
own
damnation
<EOS>
all
th
'
time
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
go
home
,
sorely
troubled
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
next
day
,
afore
I
would
get
fettle
up
 
for
indeed
,
Miss
<EOS>
,
I
would
no
heart
to
sweep
an
'
fettling
,
an
'
washing
pot
;
so
I
sit
me
down
<EOS>
i
'
th
'
muck
 
who
should
come
in
but
Maister
Weston
!
 
<EOS>
I
start
side
stuff
then
,
an
'
sweep
an
'
do
;
and
I
expect
he
would
begin
a
-
call
me
for
my
idle
way
,
as
Maister
Hatfield
would
a
'
do
;
but
I
be
mista'en
:
 
<EOS>
he
only
bid
me
good
-
mornin
'
like
,
in
a
quiet
dacent
way
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
dust
him
a
chair
,
an
'
fettle
up
th
'
fireplace
a
bit
;
but
I
have
not
forget
th
'
Rector
's
word
,
so
say
I
,
"
I
wonder
,
sir
,
you
should
give
yourself
that
trouble
,
to
come
so
far
to
see
a
"
canting
old
fool
,
"
such
as
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
seem
take
aback
at
that
;
but
he
would
fain
persuade
me
"
at
the
rector
be
only
in
jest
;
and
when
that
would
not
do
,
he
say
,
"
well
,
Nancy
,
you
should
not
think
so
much
about
it
:
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Hatfield
be
a
little
out
of
humour
just
then
:
 
<EOS>
you
know
we
be
none
of
us
<EOS>
perfect
 
<EOS>
even
Moses
speak
unadvisedly
with
his
lip
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
sit
down
a
minute
,
if
you
can
spare
the
time
,
and
tell
me
all
your
doubt
and
fear
;
and
I
will
try
to
remove
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
sit
me
down
anent
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
quite
a
stranger
,
you
know
,
Miss
Grey
,
and
even
young
nor
Maister
Hatfield
,
I
believe
;
and
I
have
think
him
not
so
pleasant
-
look
as
him
,
and
rather
a
bit
crossish
,
at
first
,
to
look
at
;
but
he
spake
so
civil
like
 
and
when
th
'
cat
,
poor
thing
,
jump
on
to
his
knee
,
he
only
stroke
her
,
and
give
a
bit
of
a
smile
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
think
that
be
a
good
sign
;
for
once
,
when
she
do
so
to
th
'
rector
,
he
knock
her
off
,
like
as
it
may
be
in
scorn
and
anger
,
poor
thing
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
can
not
expect
a
cat
to
know
manner
like
a
Christian
,
you
know
,
Miss
Grey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
of
course
not
,
Nancy
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
do
Mr.
Weston
say
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
say
nought
;
but
he
listen
to
me
as
steady
an
'
patient
as
could
be
,
an
'
never
a
bit
o
'
scorn
about
him
;
so
I
go
on
,
an
'
tell
him
all
,
just
as
I
have
tell
you
 
an
'
more
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
Mr.
Hatfield
be
quite
right
in
tell
you
to
persevere
in
do
your
duty
;
but
in
advise
you
to
go
to
church
and
attend
to
the
service
,
and
so
on
,
he
do
not
mean
that
be
the
whole
of
a
Christian
's
duty
:
 
<EOS>
he
only
think
you
may
there
learn
what
more
be
to
be
do
,
and
be
lead
to
take
delight
in
those
exercise
,
instead
of
find
them
a
task
and
a
burden
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
you
have
ask
him
to
explain
those
word
that
trouble
you
so
much
,
I
think
he
would
have
tell
you
,
that
if
many
shall
seek
to
enter
in
at
the
strait
gate
and
shall
not
be
able
,
it
be
their
own
sin
that
hinder
them
;
just
as
a
man
with
a
large
sack
on
his
back
may
wish
to
pass
through
a
narrow
doorway
,
and
find
it
impossible
to
do
so
unless
he
would
leave
his
sack
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
,
Nancy
,
I
dare
say
,
have
no
sin
that
you
would
not
gladly
throw
aside
,
if
you
know
how
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
"
indeed
,
sir
,
you
speak
truth
,
"
say
I.
  
"
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
know
the
first
and
great
commandment
 
and
the
second
,
which
be
like
unto
it
 
on
which
two
commandment
hang
all
the
law
and
the
prophet
?
 
<EOS>
You
say
you
can
not
love
God
;
but
it
strike
me
that
if
you
rightly
consider
who
and
what
He
be
,
you
can
not
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
your
father
,
your
good
friend
:
 
<EOS>
every
blessing
,
everything
good
,
pleasant
,
or
useful
,
come
from
Him
;
and
everything
evil
,
everything
you
have
reason
to
hate
,
to
shun
,
or
to
fear
,
come
from
Satan
 
his
enemy
as
well
as
ours
.
 
<EOS>
and
for
this
cause
be
God
manifest
in
the
flesh
,
that
He
may
destroy
the
work
of
the
Devil
:
 
in
one
word
,
God
be
LOVE
;
and
the
more
of
love
we
have
within
us
,
the
nearer
we
be
to
Him
and
the
more
of
His
spirit
we
possess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
well
,
sir
,
"
I
say
,
"
if
I
can
always
think
on
these
thing
,
I
think
I
may
well
love
God
:
 
<EOS>
but
how
can
I
love
my
neighbour
,
when
they
vex
me
,
and
be
so
contrary
and
sinful
as
some
on
'em
be
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
It
may
seem
a
hard
matter
,
"
say
he
,
"
to
love
our
neighbour
,
who
have
so
much
of
what
be
evil
about
them
,
and
whose
fault
so
often
awaken
the
evil
that
linger
within
ourselves
;
but
remember
that
he
make
them
,
and
he
love
them
;
and
whosoever
loveth
him
that
begat
,
loveth
him
that
be
begotten
also
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
God
so
loveth
us
,
that
He
give
His
only
begotten
Son
to
die
for
us
,
we
ought
also
to
love
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
you
can
not
feel
positive
affection
for
those
who
do
not
care
for
you
,
you
can
at
least
try
to
do
to
them
<EOS>
as
you
would
they
should
do
unto
you
:
 
you
can
endeavour
to
pity
their
failing
and
excuse
their
offence
,
and
to
do
all
the
good
you
can
to
those
about
you
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
you
accustom
yourself
to
this
,
Nancy
,
the
very
effort
itself
will
make
you
love
them
in
some
degree
 
to
say
nothing
of
the
goodwill
your
kindness
would
beget
in
them
,
though
they
may
have
little
else
that
be
good
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
if
we
love
God
and
wish
to
serve
Him
,
let
us
try
to
be
like
Him
,
to
do
His
work
,
to
labour
for
His
glory
 
which
be
the
good
of
man
 
to
hasten
the
coming
of
His
kingdom
,
which
be
the
peace
and
happiness
of
all
the
world
:
 
however
powerless
we
may
seem
to
be
,
in
do
all
the
good
we
can
through
life
,
the
humblest
of
us
may
do
much
towards
it
:
 
and
let
us
dwell
in
love
,
that
He
may
dwell
in
us
and
we
in
Him
.
 
<EOS>
the
more
happiness
we
bestow
<EOS>
,
the
more
we
shall
receive
,
even
here
;
and
the
great
will
be
our
reward
in
heaven
when
we
rest
from
our
labour
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
believe
,
Miss
,
them
be
his
very
word
,
<EOS>
for
I
have
think
'em
ower
many
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
an
'
then
he
take
that
Bible
,
an
'
read
bit
here
and
there
,
an
'
explain
'em
as
clear
as
the
day
:
 
and
it
seem
like
as
a
new
light
break
in
on
my
soul
;
an
'
I
feel
fair
aglow
about
my
heart
,
an
'
only
wish
poor
Bill
an
'
all
the
world
could
ha
'
be
there
,
an
'
hear
it
all
,
and
rejoice
wi

me

<EOS>
"
after
he
be
go
,
Hannah
Rogers
,
one
o
'
th
'
neighbour
,
come
in
and
want
me
to
help
her
to
wash
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
her
<EOS>
I
could
not
just
then
,
for
I
have
not
set
on
th
'
potatie
for
th
'
dinner
,
nor
wash
up
th
'
breakfast
stuff
yet
.
 
<EOS>
so
then
she
begin
a
-
call
me
for
my
nasty
idle
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
little
bit
vexed
at
first
,
but
I
never
say
nothing
wrong
to
her
:
 
<EOS>
I
only
tell
her
like
all
in
a
quiet
way
,
"
at
I
would
have
th
'
new
parson
to
see
me
;
but
I
would
get
do
as
quick
as
ever
<EOS>
I
could
,
an
'
then
come
an
'
help
her
.
 
<EOS>
so
then
she
soften
down
;
and
my
heart
like
as
it
warm
towards
her
,
an
'
in
a
bit
we
be
very
good
friend
.
 
<EOS>
an
'
<EOS>
so
it
be
,
Miss
Grey
,
"
a
soft
answer
turneth
away
wrath
;
but
grievous
word
stir
up
anger
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
only
in
them
you
speak
to
,
but
in
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
true
,
Nancy
,
if
we
could
always
remember
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
if
we
could
!
"
  
"
and
do
Mr.
Weston
ever
come
to
see
you
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
many
a
time
;
and
since
my
eye
have
be
so
bad
,
he
be
sit
an
'
read
to
me
by
the
half
-
hour
together
:
 
but
you
know
,
Miss
,
he
have
other
folk
to
see
,
and
other
thing
to
do
 
God
bless
him
!
 
<EOS>
an
'
that
next
Sunday
he
preach
SUCH
a
sermon
!
 
<EOS>
His
text
be
,
"
come
unto
me
all
ye
<EOS>
that
labour
and
be
heavy
laden
,
and
I
will
give
you
rest
,
"
and
them
two
bless
verse
that
follow
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
not
there
,
Miss
,
you
be
with
your
friend
then
 
<EOS>
but
it
make
me
so
happy
!
 
<EOS>
and
I
am
happy
now
,
thank
God
!
<EOS>
an
'
I
take
a
pleasure
,
now
,
in
do
little
bit
<EOS>
o
'
job
for
my
neighbour
 
such
as
a
poor
old
body
"
at
's
half
blind
can
do
;
and
they
take
it
kindly
of
me
,
just
as
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
,
Miss
<EOS>
,
I
be
knit
a
pair
o
'
stocking
now
;
  
they
be
for
Thomas
Jackson
:
 
<EOS>
he
be
a
queerish
old
body
<EOS>
,
an
'
we
have
have
many
a
bout
at
threape
,
one
anent
t'other
;
an
'
at
time
we
have
differ
sorely
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
think
I
could
not
do
well
nor
knit
him
a
pair
o
'
warm
stocking
;
an
'
I
have
feel
to
like
him
<EOS>
a
deal
well
,
poor
old
man
,
sin
'
<EOS>
I
begin
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
turn
out
just
as
Maister
Weston
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
be
very
glad
to
see
you
so
happy
,
Nancy
,
and
so
wise
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
go
now
;
I
shall
be
want
at
the
Hall
,
"
say
I
;
and
bid
her
good
-
bye
<EOS>
,
I
depart
,
promise
to
come
again
when
I
have
time
,
and
feel
nearly
as
happy
as
herself
.
  
<EOS>
at
another
time
I
go
to
read
to
a
poor
labourer
who
be
in
the
last
stage
of
consumption
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
lady
have
be
to
see
him
,
and
somehow
a
promise
of
reading
have
be
extract
from
them
;
but
it
be
too
much
trouble
,
so
they
beg
me
to
do
it
instead
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
,
willingly
enough
;
and
there
too
I
be
gratify
with
the
praise
of
Mr.
Weston
,
both
from
the
sick
man
and
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
the
former
tell
me
that
he
derive
great
comfort
and
benefit
from
the
visit
of
the
new
parson
,
who
frequently
come
to
see
him
,
and
be
"
another
guess
sort
of
man
'
to
Mr.
Hatfield
;
who
,
before
the
other
's
arrival
at
Horton
,
have
now
and
then
pay
him
a
visit
;
on
which
occasion
he
would
always
insist
upon
have
the
cottage
-
door
keep
open
,
to
admit
the
fresh
air
for
his
own
convenience
,
without
consider
how
it
may
injure
the
sufferer
;
and
have
open
his
prayer
-
book
and
hastily
read
over
a
part
of
the
Service
for
the
Sick
,
would
hurry
away
again
:
 
if
he
do
not
stay
to
administer
some
harsh
rebuke
to
the
afflict
wife
,
or
to
make
some
thoughtless
,
not
to
say
heartless
,
observation
,
rather
calculate
to
increase
than
diminish
the
trouble
of
the
suffering
pair
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whereas
,
"
say
the
man
,
"
Maister
Weston
'
ull
pray
with
me
quite
in
a
different
fashion
,
an
'
talk
to
me
as
kind
as
owt
<EOS>
;
an
'
oft
read
to
me
too
,
an
'
sit
beside
me
just
like
a
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
just
for
all
the
world
!
"
exclaim
his
wife
;
"
an
'
about
a
three
wik
sin
"
,
when
he
seed
how
poor
Jem
shiver
wi
'
cold
,
an
'
what
pitiful
fire
we
keep
,
he
axe
if
wer
stock
of
coal
be
nearly
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
it
be
,
an
'
we
be
ill
set
to
get
more
:
 
<EOS>
but
you
know
,
mum
,
I
do
not
think
o
'
him
help
us
;
<EOS>
but
,
howsever
,
he
send
us
a
sack
o
'
coal
next
day
;
an
'
we
have
have
good
fire
ever
sin
'
:
 
and
a
great
blessing
it
be
,
this
winter
time
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
be
his
way
,
Miss
Grey
:
 
when
he
come
into
a
poor
body
's
house
a-
seein
'
sick
folk
,
he
like
notice
<EOS>
what
they
most
stand
<EOS>
i
'
need
on
;
an
'
if
he
think
they
can
not
readily
get
it
therseln
,
he
never
say
nowt
about
it
,
but
just
get
it
for
'em
.
 
<EOS>
an
'
<EOS>
it
be
not
everybody
"
at
'
ud
do
that
,
"
at
have
as
little
as
he
have
:
 
for
you
know
,
mum
,
he
be
nowt
at
all
to
live
on
but
what
he
get
fra
'
th
'
rector
,
<EOS>
an
'
that
be
little
enough
they
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
remember
then
,
with
a
species
of
exultation
,
that
he
have
frequently
be
style
a
vulgar
brute
by
the
amiable
Miss
Murray
,
because
he
wear
a
silver
watch
,
and
clothe
not
quite
so
bright
and
fresh
as
Mr.
Hatfield
's
.
  
<EOS>
in
return
to
the
Lodge
I
feel
very
happy
,
and
thank
God
that
I
have
now
something
to
think
about
;
something
to
dwell
on
as
a
relief
from
the
weary
monotony
,
the
lonely
drudgery
,
of
my
present
life
:
for
I
be
lonely
.
 
<EOS>
never
,
from
month
to
month
,
from
year
to
year
,
except
during
my
brief
interval
of
rest
at
home
,
do
I
see
one
creature
to
whom
I
could
open
my
heart
,
or
freely
speak
my
thought
with
any
hope
of
sympathy
,
or
even
comprehension
:
 
never
one
,
unless
it
be
poor
Nancy
Brown
,
with
whom
I
could
enjoy
a
single
moment
of
real
social
intercourse
,
or
whose
conversation
be
calculate
to
render
me
better
,
wise
,
or
happy
than
before
;
or
who
,
as
far
as
I
could
see
,
could
be
greatly
benefit
by
mine
.
 
<EOS>
My
only
companion
have
be
unamiable
child
,
and
ignorant
,
wrong
-
head
girl
;
from
whose
fatiguing
folly
,
unbroken
solitude
be
often
a
relief
most
earnestly
desire
and
dearly
prize
.
 
<EOS>
but
to
be
restrict
to
such
associate
be
a
serious
evil
,
both
in
its
immediate
effect
and
the
consequence
that
be
likely
to
ensue
.
<EOS>
never
a
new
idea
or
stirring
thought
come
to
me
from
without
;
and
such
as
rise
within
me
be
,
for
the
most
part
,
miserably
crush
at
once
,
or
doom
to
sicken
or
fade
away
,
because
they
could
not
see
the
light
.
  
<EOS>
habitual
associate
be
know
to
exercise
a
great
influence
over
each
other
's
mind
and
manner
.
 
<EOS>
those
whose
action
be
for
ever
before
our
eye
,
whose
word
be
ever
in
our
ear
,
will
naturally
lead
us
,
albeit
against
our
will
,
slowly
,
gradually
,
imperceptibly
,
perhaps
,
to
act
and
speak
as
they
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
presume
to
say
how
far
this
irresistible
power
of
assimilation
extend
;
but
if
one
civilised
man
be
doom
to
pass
a
dozen
year
amid
a
race
of
intractable
savage
,
unless
he
have
power
to
improve
them
,
I
greatly
question
whether
,
at
the
close
of
that
period
,
he
would
not
have
become
,
at
least
,
a
barbarian
himself
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
,
as
I
could
not
make
my
young
companion
better
,
fear
exceedingly
that
they
would
make
me
bad
 
would
gradually
bring
my
feeling
,
habit
,
capacity
,
to
the
level
of
their
own
;
without
,
however
,
impart
to
me
their
lightheartedness
and
cheerful
vivacity
.
  
<EOS>
already
,
I
seem
to
feel
my
intellect
deteriorate
,
my
heart
petrifying
,
my
soul
contracting
;
<EOS>
and
I
tremble
lest
my
very
moral
perception
should
become
deadened
,
my
distinction
of
right
and
wrong
confounded
,
and
all
my
well
faculty
be
sink
,
at
last
,
beneath
the
baneful
influence
of
such
a
mode
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
the
gross
vapour
of
earth
be
gather
around
me
,
and
close
in
upon
my
inward
heaven
;
and
thus
it
be
that
Mr.
Weston
rise
at
length
upon
me
,
appear
like
the
morning
star
in
my
horizon
,
to
save
me
from
the
fear
of
utter
darkness
;
and
I
rejoice
that
I
have
now
a
subject
for
contemplation
that
be
above
me
,
not
beneath
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
see
that
all
the
world
be
not
make
up
of
Bloomfields
,
Murrays
,
Hatfields
,
Ashbys
,
&
c.
;
and
that
human
excellence
be
not
a
mere
dream
of
the
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
hear
a
little
good
and
no
harm
of
a
person
,
it
be
easy
and
pleasant
to
imagine
more
:
 
in
short
,
it
be
needless
to
analyse
all
my
thought
;
but
Sunday
be
now
become
a
day
of
peculiar
delight
to
me
(
I
be
now
almost
break
-
in
to
the
back
corner
in
the
carriage
)
,
for
I
like
to
hear
him
 
<EOS>
and
I
like
to
see
him
,
too
;
though
I
know
he
be
not
handsome
,
or
even
what
be
call
agreeable
,
in
outward
aspect
;
but
,
certainly
,
he
be
not
ugly
.
  
<EOS>
in
stature
he
be
a
little
,
a
very
little
,
above
the
middle
size
;
the
outline
of
his
face
would
be
pronounce
too
square
for
beauty
,
but
to
me
it
announce
decision
of
character
;
his
dark
brown
hair
be
not
carefully
curl
,
like
Mr.
Hatfield
's
,
but
simply
brush
aside
over
a
broad
white
forehead
;
the
eyebrow
,
I
suppose
,
be
too
project
,
but
from
under
those
dark
brow
there
gleam
an
eye
of
singular
power
,
brown
in
colour
,
not
large
,
and
somewhat
deep
-
set
,
but
strikingly
brilliant
,
and
full
of
expression
;
there
be
character
,
too
,
in
the
mouth
,
something
that
bespoke
a
man
of
firm
purpose
and
an
habitual
thinker
;
and
when
he
smile
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
speak
of
that
yet
,
for
,
<EOS>
at
the
time
I
mention
,
I
have
never
see
him
smile
:
 
and
,
indeed
,
his
general
appearance
do
not
impress
me
with
the
idea
of
a
man
give
to
such
a
relaxation
,
nor
of
such
an
individual
as
the
cottager
describe
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
early
form
my
opinion
of
him
;
and
,
in
spite
of
Miss
Murray
's
objurgation
:
 
be
fully
convince
that
he
be
a
man
of
strong
sense
,
firm
faith
,
and
ardent
piety
,
but
thoughtful
and
stern
:
 
and
when
I
find
that
,
to
his
other
good
quality
,
be
add
that
of
true
benevolence
and
gentle
,
considerate
kindness
,
the
discovery
,
perhaps
,
delight
me
the
more
,
as
I
have
not
be
prepare
to
expect
it
.
    
<EOS>
the
SHOWER
  
<EOS>
the
next
visit
I
pay
to
Nancy
Brown
be
in
the
second
week
in
March
:
 
for
,
though
I
have
many
spare
minute
during
the
day
,
I
seldom
could
look
upon
an
hour
as
entirely
my
own
;
since
,
where
everything
be
leave
to
the
caprice
of
Miss
Matilda
and
her
sister
,
there
could
be
no
order
or
regularity
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
occupation
I
choose
,
when
not
actually
busied
about
them
or
their
concern
,
I
have
,
as
it
be
,
to
keep
my
loin
gird
,
my
shoe
on
my
foot
,
and
my
staff
in
my
hand
;
for
not
to
be
immediately
forthcoming
when
call
for
,
be
regard
as
a
grave
and
inexcusable
offence
:
 
not
only
by
my
pupil
and
their
mother
,
but
by
the
very
servant
,
who
come
in
breathless
haste
to
call
me
,
exclaim
,
"
You
be
to
go
to
the
schoolroom
DIRECTLY
,
mum
,
the
young
lady
be
WAITING
!
!
"
<EOS>
climax
of
horror
!
<EOS>
actually
wait
for
their
governess
!
!
!
  
<EOS>
but
this
time
I
be
pretty
sure
of
an
hour
or
two
to
myself
;
for
Matilda
be
prepare
for
a
long
ride
,
and
Rosalie
be
dress
for
a
dinner
-
party
at
Lady
Ashby
's
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
take
the
opportunity
of
repair
to
the
widow
's
cottage
,
where
I
find
her
in
some
anxiety
about
her
cat
,
which
have
be
absent
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
comfort
her
with
as
many
anecdote
of
that
animal
's
rove
propensity
as
I
could
recollect
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
fear
o
'
th
'
gamekeeper
,
"
say
she
:
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
"
at
I
think
on
.
 
<EOS>
if
th
'
young
gentleman
have
be
at
home
,
I
should
a
'
thought
they
would
be
set
their
dog
at
her
,
an
'
worry
her
,
poor
thing
,
as
they
do
many
a
poor
thing
's
cat
;
but
I
have
not
that
to
be

Nancy
's
eye
be
well
,
but
still
far
from
well
:
 
<EOS>
she
have
be
try
to
make
a
Sunday
shirt
for
her
son
,
but
tell
me
she
could
only
bear
to
do
a
little
bit
at
it
now
and
then
,
so
that
it
progress
but
slowly
,
though
the
poor
lad
want
it
sadly
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
propose
to
help
her
a
little
,
after
I
have
read
to
her
,
for
I
have
plenty
of
time
that
evening
,
and
nee
not
return
till
dusk
.
 
<EOS>
She
thankfully
accept
the
offer
.
 
<EOS>
"
an
'
you
will
be
a
bit
o
'
company
for
me
too
,
Miss
,
"
say
she
;
"
I
like
as
I
feel
lonesome
without
my
cat
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
when
I
have
finish
read
,
and
do
the
half
of
a
seam
,
with
Nancy
's
capacious
brass
thimble
fit
on
to
my
finger
by
mean
of
a
roll
of
paper
,
I
be
disturb
by
the
entrance
of
Mr.
Weston
,
with
the
identical
cat
in
his
arm
.
<EOS>
I
now
see
that
he
could
smile
,
and
very
pleasantly
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
do
you
a
piece
of
good
service
,
Nancy
,
"
he
begin
:
 
then
see
me
,
he
acknowledge
my
presence
by
a
slight
bow
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
be
invisible
to
Hatfield
,
or
any
other
gentleman
of
those
part
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
deliver
your
cat
,
"
he
continue
,
"
from
the
hand
,
or
rather
the
gun
,
of
Mr.
Murray
's
gamekeeper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
sir

"
cry
the
grateful
old
woman
,
ready
to
weep
for
joy
as
she
receive
her
favourite
from
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
take
care
of
it
,
"
say
he
,
"
and
do
not
let
it
go
near
the
rabbit

warren
,
for
the
gamekeeper
swear
he
will
shoot
it
if
he
see
it
there
again
:
 
he
would
have
do
so
to

day
,
if
I
have
not

to
stop
him

<EOS>
I

add
he
,
more
quietly
,
observe
that
I
have
put
aside
my
work

be
prepare
to
depart

<EOS>
"
do

You

Nancy

as
she
stir
the
fire
,
and
place
another
chair
beside
it
;
"
what

there
be
room
for
all

<EOS>
"
I
can

well
here

Nancy

<EOS>
reply
I
,
take
my
work
to
the
window
,
where
she
have
the
goodness
to
suffer
me
to
remain
unmolested
,
while
she
get
a
brush
to
remove
the
cat
's
hair
from
Mr.
Weston
's
coat
,
carefully
wipe
the
rain
from
his
hat
,
and
give
the
cat
its
supper
,
busily
talk
all
the
time
:
 
now
thank
her
clerical
friend
for
what
he
have
do
;
now
wonder
how
the
cat
have
find
out
the
warren
;
and
now
lament
the
probable
consequence
of
such
a
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
He
listen
with
a
quiet
,
good
-
natured
smile
,
and
at
length
take
a
seat
in
compliance
with
her
press
invitation
,
but
repeat
that
he
do
not
mean
to
stay
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
another
place

<EOS>
I
see

glance
at
the
book
on

table

someone
else

yes

You

could
stop

the
provoking

seize
his

I

be
no

<EOS>
"
Miss
Grey

"
say
he
,
half
-
jestingly

as
if
he
feel
it
necessary
to
change
the
present
subject
,
whether
he
have
anything
particular
to
say
or
not
,

I
wish
you
would
make
my
peace
with
the
squire
,
when
you
see
him

<EOS>
He
be
by
when
I
rescue
Nancy
's
cat
,
and
do
not
quite
approve
of
the
deed
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
think
he
may
better
spare
all
his
rabbit
than
she
her
cat
,
for
which
audacious
assertion
he
treat
me
to
some
rather
ungentlemanly
language
;
and
I
fear
I
retort
a
trifle
too
warmly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
lawful
sir

<EOS>
I
hope
you

out

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
it
be
no
matter
,
Nancy
:
 
I
do
not
care
about
it
,
really
;
I
say
nothing
very
uncivil
;
and
I
suppose
Mr.
Murray
be
accustomed
to
use
rather
strong
language
when
he
be
heat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
sir
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
pity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
I
really
must
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
to
visit
a
place
a
mile
beyond
this
;

you
would
not
have
me
to
return
in
the
dark
:

,
it
have
nearly
do
rain
now

so
good

evening

<EOS>
good
-
evening

Miss
Grey

"
  
<EOS>
"
good
-
evening

Mr.
Weston

do
not

upon
me

make
your
peace

I
never

"
do
not
you
;
it
can
not

help
then

reply
he
,
in
dolorous
resignation
:
 
then
,
with
a
peculiar
half
-
smile
,
he
add
,
"
but
never
mind
<EOS>
;
I
imagine
the
squire
have
more
to
apologise
for
than
I
;
"
and
leave
the
cottage
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
on
with
my
sewing
as
long
as
I
could
see
,
and
then
bid
Nancy
good
-
evening
;
check
her
too
lively
gratitude
by
the
undeniable
assurance
that
I
have
only
do
for
her
what
she
would
have
do
for
me
,
if
she
have
be
in
my
place
and
I
in
hers
.
 
<EOS>
I
hasten
back
to
Horton
Lodge
,
where
,
have
enter
the
schoolroom
,
I
find
the
tea
-
table
all
in
confusion
,
the
tray
flood
with
slop
,
and
Miss
Matilda
in
a
most
ferocious
humour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Grey
,
whatever
have
you
be
about
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
have
tea
<EOS>
half
an
hour
ago
,
and
have
to
make
it
myself
,
and
drink
it
all
alone
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
come
in
sooner
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
to
see
Nancy
Brown
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
would
not
be
back
from
your
ride
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
could
I
ride
in
the
rain
,
I
should
like
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
that
damn
pelt
shower
be
vexatious
enough
 
come
on
when
I
be
just
in
full
swing
:
 
and
then
to
come
and
find
nobody
in
to
tea
!
<EOS>
and
you
know
I
can
not
make
the
tea
as
I
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
of
the
shower
,
"
reply
I
(
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
the
thought
of
its
drive
her
home
have
never
enter
my
head
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
of
course
;
you
be
under
shelter
yourself
,
and
you
never
think
of
other
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
bear
her
coarse
reproach
with
astonishing
equanimity
,
even
with
cheerfulness
;
for
I
be
sensible
that
I
have
do
more
good
to
Nancy
Brown
than
harm
to
her
:
 
and
perhaps
some
other
thought
assist
to
keep
up
my
spirit
,
and
impart
a
relish
to
the
cup
of
cold
,
overdrawn
tea
,
and
a
charm
to
the
otherwise
unsightly
table
;
and
 
I
have
almost
say
 
to
Miss
Matilda
's
unamiable
face
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
soon
betook
herself
to
the
stable
,
and
leave
me
to
the
quiet
enjoyment
of
my
solitary
meal
.
    
<EOS>
the
primrose
  
Miss
Murray
now
always
go
twice
to
church
,
for
she
so
love
admiration
that
she
could
not
bear
to
lose
a
single
opportunity
of
obtain
it
;
and
she
be
so
sure
of
it
<EOS>
wherever
she
show
herself
,
that
,
whether
Harry
Meltham
and
Mr.
Green
be
there
or
not
,
there
be
certain
to
be
somebody
present
who
would
not
be
insensible
to
her
charm
,
besides
the
rector
,
whose
official
capacity
generally
oblige
him
to
attend
.
 
<EOS>
usually
,
also
,
if
the
weather
permit
,
both
she
and
her
sister
would
walk
home
;
<EOS>
Matilda
,
because
she
hate
the
confinement
of
the
carriage
;
she
,
because
she
dislike
the
privacy
of
it
,
and
enjoy
the
company
that
generally
enliven
the
first
mile
of
the
journey
in
walk
from
the
church
to
Mr.
Green
's
park
-
gate
:
 
near
which
commence
the
private
road
to
Horton
Lodge
,
which
lie
in
the
opposite
direction
,
while
the
highway
conduct
in
a
straightforward
course
to
the
still
more
distant
mansion
of
Sir
Hugh
Meltham
.
 
<EOS>
thus
there
be
always
a
chance
of
be
accompany
,
so
far
,
either
by
Harry
Meltham
,
with
or
without
Miss
Meltham
,
or
Mr.
Green
,
with
perhaps
one
or
both
of
his
sister
,
and
any
gentleman
visitor
they
may
have
.
  
<EOS>
whether
I
walk
with
the
young
lady
or
ride
with
their
parent
,
depend
upon
their
own
capricious
will
:
 
if
they
choose
to
"
take
"
me
<EOS>
,
I
go
;
if
,
for
reason
best
know
to
themselves
,
they
choose
to
go
alone
<EOS>
,
I
take
my
seat
in
the
carriage
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
walk
better
,
but
a
sense
of
reluctance
to
obtrude
my
presence
on
anyone
who
do
not
desire
it
,
always
keep
me
passive
on
these
and
similar
occasion
;
and
I
never
inquire
into
the
cause
of
their
varying
whim
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
this
be
the
good
policy
 
for
to
submit
and
oblige
<EOS>
be
the
governess
's
part
,
to
consult
their
own
pleasure
<EOS>
be
that
of
the
pupil
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
I
do
walk
,
the
first
half
of
journey
be
generally
a
great
nuisance
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
as
none
of
the
before
-
mention
lady
and
gentleman
ever
notice
me
,
it
be
disagreeable
to
walk
beside
them
,
as
if
listen
to
what
they
say
,
or
wish
to
be
think
one
of
them
,
while
they
talk
over
me
,
or
across
;
and
if
their
eye
,
in
speaking
,
chance
to
fall
on
me
,
it
seem
as
if
they
look
on
vacancy
 
as
if
they
either
do
not
see
me
,
or
be
very
desirous
to
make
it
appear
so
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
disagreeable
,
too
,
to
walk
behind
,
and
thus
appear
to
acknowledge
my
own
inferiority
;
for
,
in
truth
,
I
consider
myself
pretty
nearly
as
good
as
the
good
of
them
,
and
wish
them
to
know
that
I
do
so
,
and
not
to
imagine
that
I
look
upon
myself
as
a
mere
domestic
,
who
know
her
own
place
too
well
to
walk
beside
such
fine
lady
and
gentleman
as
they
be
 
though
her
young
lady
may
choose
to
have
her
with
them
,
and
even
condescend
to
converse
with
her
when
no
well
company
be
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
thus
 
I
be
almost
ashamed
to
confess
it
 
<EOS>
but
indeed
I
give
myself
no
little
trouble
in
my
endeavour
(
if
I
do
keep
up
with
them
)
to
appear
perfectly
unconscious
or
regardless
of
their
presence
,
as
if
I
be
wholly
absorb
in
my
own
reflection
,
or
the
contemplation
of
surround
object
;
<EOS>
or
,
if
I
linger
behind
,
it
be
some
bird
or
insect
,
some
tree
or
flower
,
<EOS>
that
attract
my
attention
,
and
have
duly
examine
that
,
I
would
pursue
my
walk
alone
,
at
a
leisurely
pace
,
until
my
pupil
have
bid
adieu
to
their
companion
and
turn
off
into
the
quiet
private
road
.
  
<EOS>
one
such
occasion
<EOS>
I
particularly
well
remember
;
it
be
a
lovely
afternoon
about
the
close
of
March
;
Mr.
Green
and
his
sister
have
send
their
carriage
back
empty
,
in
order
to
enjoy
the
bright
sunshine
and
balmy
air
in
a
sociable
walk
home
along
with
their
visitor
,
Captain
Somebody
and
Lieutenant
Somebody
-
else
(
a
couple
of
military
fop
)
,
and
the
Misses
Murray
,
who
,
of
course
,
contrive
to
join
them
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
party
be
highly
agreeable
to
Rosalie
;
but
not
find
it
equally
suitable
to
my
taste
,
I
presently
fall
back
,
and
begin
to
botanise
and
entomologise
along
the
green
bank
and
bud
hedge
,
till
the
company
be
considerably
in
advance
of
me
,
and
I
could
hear
the
sweet
song
of
the
happy
lark
;
then
my
spirit
of
misanthropy
begin
to
melt
away
beneath
the
soft
,
pure
air
and
genial
sunshine
;
but
sad
thought
of
early
childhood
,
and
yearning
for
depart
joy
,
or
for
a
bright
future
lot
,
arise
instead
.
 
<EOS>
as
my
eye
wander
over
the
steep
bank
cover
with
young
grass
and
green
-
leaved
plant
,
and
surmount
by
bud
hedge
,
I
long
intensely
for
some
familiar
flower
that
may
recall
the
woody
dale
or
green
hill
-
side
of
home
:
 
<EOS>
the
brown
moorland
,
of
course
,
be
out
of
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
discovery
would
make
my
eye
gush
out
with
water
,
no
doubt
;
but
that
be
one
of
my
great
enjoyment
now
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
I
descry
,
high
up
between
the
twisted
root
of
an
oak
,
three
lovely
primrose
,
peep
so
sweetly
from
their
hiding
-
place
that
the
tear
already
start
at
the
sight
;
but
they
grow
so
high
above
me
,
that
I
try
in
vain
to
gather
one
or
two
,
to
dream
over
and
to
carry
with
me
:
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
reach
them
unless
I
climb
the
bank
,
which
I
be
deter
from
do
by
hear
a
footstep
at
that
moment
behind
me
,
and
be
,
therefore
,
about
to
turn
away
,
when
I
be
startle
by
the
word
<EOS>
,
"
allow
me
to
gather
them
for
you
,
Miss
Grey
,
"
speak
in
the
grave
,
low
tone
of
a
well
-
know
voice
.
 
<EOS>
immediately
the
flower
be
gather
,
and
in
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Mr.
Weston
,
of
course
 
who
else
would
trouble
himself
to
do
so
much
for
me
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
him
;
whether
warmly
or
coldly
,
I
can
not
tell
:
 
but
certain
I
be
that
I
do
not
express
half
the
gratitude
I
feel
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
foolish
,
perhaps
,
to
feel
any
gratitude
at
all
;
but
it
seem
to
me
,
at
that
moment
,
as
if
this
be
a
remarkable
instance
of
his
good
-
nature
:
 
an
act
of
kindness
,
which
I
could
not
repay
,
but
never
should
forget
:
 
<EOS>
so
utterly
unaccustomed
be
I
to
receive
such
civility
,
so
little
prepared
to
expect
them
from
anyone
within
fifty
mile
of
Horton
Lodge
.
 
<EOS>
yet
this
do
not
prevent
me
from
feel
a
little
uncomfortable
in
his
presence
;
and
I
proceed
to
follow
my
pupil
at
a
much
quick
pace
than
before
;
though
,
perhaps
,
if
Mr.
Weston
have
take
the
hint
,
and
let
me
pass
without
another
word
,
I
may
have
repeat
it
an
hour
after
:
 
but
he
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
a
somewhat
rapid
walk
for
me
be
but
an
ordinary
pace
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
young
lady
have
leave
you
alone
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
they
be
occupy
with
more
agreeable
company
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
then
do
not
trouble
yourself
to
overtake
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
slacken
my
pace
;
but
next
moment
regret
have
do
so
:
 
<EOS>
my
companion
do
not
speak
;
and
I
have
nothing
in
the
world
to
say
,
and
fear
he
may
be
in
the
same
predicament
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
he
break
the
pause
by
ask
,
with
a
certain
quiet
abruptness
peculiar
to
himself
,
if
I
like
flower
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
very
much
,
"
I
answer
,
"
wild
-
flower
especially
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
wild
-
flower
,
"
say
he
;
"
other
I
do
not
care
about
,
because
I
have
no
particular
association
connect
with
them
 
except
one
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
your
favourite
flower
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
primrose
,
bluebell
,
and
heath
-
blossom
.
"
  
"
not
violet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
because
,
as
you
say
,
I
have
no
particular
association
connect
with
them
;
for
there
be
no
sweet
violet
among
the
hill
and
valley
<EOS>
round
my
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
a
great
consolation
to
you
to
have
a
home
,
Miss
Grey
,
"
observe
my
companion
after
a
short
pause
:
 
"
however
remote
,
or
however
seldom
visit
,
still
it
be
something
to
look
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
so
much
that
I
think
I
could
not
live
without
it
,
"
reply
I
,
with
an
enthusiasm
of
which
I
immediately
repent
;
for
I
think
it
must
have
sound
essentially
silly
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
you
could
,
"
say
he
,
with
a
thoughtful
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
tie
that
bind
us
to
life
be
tough
than
you
imagine
,
or
than
anyone
can
who
have
not
feel
how
roughly
they
may
be
pull
without
break
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
be
miserable
without
a
home
,
but
even
you
could
live
;
and
not
so
miserably
as
you
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
the
human
heart
be
like
india
-
rubber
;
a
little
swell
it
,
but
a
great
deal
will
not
burst
it
.
 
<EOS>
if
"
little
more
than
nothing
will
disturb
it
,
little
less
than
all
thing
will
suffice
"
to
break
it
.
 
<EOS>
as
in
the
outer
member
of
our
frame
,
there
be
a
vital
power
inherent
in
itself
that
strengthen
it
against
external
violence
.
 
<EOS>
every
blow
that
shake
it
will
serve
to
harden
it
against
a
future
stroke
;
as
constant
labour
thicken
the
skin
of
the
hand
,
and
strengthen
its
muscle
instead
of
waste
them
away
:
 
so
that
a
day
of
arduous
toil
,
that
may
excoriate
a
lady
's
palm
,
would
make
no
sensible
impression
on
that
of
a
hardy
ploughman
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
speak
from
experience
 
partly
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
time
when
I
think
as
you
do
 
<EOS>
at
least
,
I
be
fully
persuade
that
home
and
its
affection
<EOS>
be
the
only
thing
that
make
life
tolerable
:
<EOS>
that
,
if
deprive
of
these
,
existence
would
become
a
burden
hard
to
be
endure
;
but
now
I
have
no
home
 
unless
you
would
dignify
my
two
hire
room
at
Horton
by
such
a
name
;
 
and
not
twelve
month
ago
I
lose
the
last
and
dearest
of
my
early
friend
;
and
yet
,
not
only
I
live
,
but
I
be
not
wholly
destitute
of
hope
and
comfort
,
even
for
this
life
:
 
though
I
must
acknowledge
that
I
can
seldom
enter
even
an
humble
cottage
at
the
close
of
day
,
and
see
its
inhabitant
peaceably
gather
around
their
cheerful
hearth
,
without
a
feeling
almost
of
envy
at
their
domestic
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
what
happiness
lie
before
you
yet
,
"
say
I
:
 
<EOS>
"
you
be
now
only
in
the
commencement
of
your
journey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
good
of
happiness
,
"
reply
he
,
"
be
mine
already
 
<EOS>
the
power
and
the
will
to
be
useful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
now
approach
a
stile
communicate
with
a
footpath
that
conduct
to
a
farm
-
house
,
where
,
I
suppose
,
Mr.
Weston
purpose
to
make
himself
"
useful
;
"
for
he
presently
take
leave
of
me
,
cross
the
stile
,
and
traverse
the
path
with
his
usual
firm
,
elastic
tread
,
leave
me
to
ponder
his
word
as
I
continue
my
course
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hear
before
that
he
have
lose
his
mother
not
many
month
before
he
come
.
 
<EOS>
She
then
be
the
last
and
dearest
of
his
early
friend
;
and
he
have
no
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
pity
him
from
my
heart
:
 
<EOS>
I
almost
weep
for
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
,
I
think
,
account
for
the
shade
of
premature
thoughtfulness
that
so
frequently
cloud
his
brow
,
and
obtain
for
him
the
reputation
of
a
morose
and
sullen
disposition
with
the
charitable
Miss
Murray
and
all
her
kin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
,
"
think
I
,
"
he
be
not
so
miserable
as
I
should
be
under
such
a
deprivation
:
 
<EOS>
he
lead
an
active
life
;
and
a
wide
field
for
useful
exertion
lie
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
make
friend
;
and
he
can
make
a
home
too
,
if
he
please
;
and
,
doubtless
,
he
will
please
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
God
grant
the
partner
of
that
home
may
be
worthy
of
his
choice
,
and
make
it
a
happy
one
 
<EOS>
such
a
home
as
he
deserve
to
have
!
 
<EOS>
and
how
delightful
it
would
be
to
"
 
<EOS>
but
no
matter
what
I
think
.
  
<EOS>
I
begin
this
book
with
the
intention
of
conceal
nothing
;
that
those
who
like
may
have
the
benefit
of
peruse
a
fellow-
creature
's
heart
:
 
but
we
have
some
thought
that
all
the
angel
in
heaven
be
welcome
to
behold
,
but
not
our
brother
-
man
 
<EOS>
not
even
the
good
and
kind
amongst
them
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
Greens
have
take
themselves
to
their
own
abode
,
and
the
Murrays
have
turn
down
the
private
road
,
whither
I
hasten
to
follow
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
the
two
girl
warm
in
an
animate
discussion
on
the
respective
merit
of
the
two
young
officer
;
but
on
see
me
Rosalie
break
off
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
to
exclaim
,
with
malicious
glee
     
<EOS>
"
Oh
-
ho
,
Miss
Grey
!
<EOS>
you
be
come
at
last
,
be
you
?
 
<EOS>
no
WONDER
you
linger
so
long
behind
;
and
<EOS>
no
WONDER
you
always
stand
up
so
vigorously
for
Mr.
Weston
when
I
abuse
him
.
 
<EOS>
ah
-
ha
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
it
all
now
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
come
,
Miss
Murray
,
do
not
be
foolish
,
"
say
I
,
attempt
a
good
-
natured
laugh
;
"
you
know
such
nonsense
can
make
no
impression
on
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
she
still
go
on
talk
such
intolerable
stuff
 
<EOS>
her
sister
help
her
with
appropriate
fiction
coin
for
the
occasion
 
that
I
think
it
necessary
to
say
something
in
my
own
justification
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
folly
all
this
be
!
"
<EOS>
I
exclaim
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
Mr.
Weston
's
road
happen
to
be
the
same
as
mine
for
a
few
yard
,
and
if
he
choose
to
exchange
a
word
or
two
in
passing
,
what
be
there
so
remarkable
in
that
?
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
I
never
speak
to
him
before
:
 
except
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
?
where
?
<EOS>
and
when
?
"
cry
they
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
Nancy
's
cottage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
-
ha
!
<EOS>
you
have
meet
him
there
,
have
you
?
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Rosalie
,
with
exultant
laughter
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
now
,
Matilda
,
I
have
find
out
why
she
be
so
fond
of
go
to
Nancy
Brown
's
!
 
<EOS>
She
go
there
to
flirt
with
Mr.
Weston
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
really
,
that
be
not
worth
contradict
 
<EOS>
I
only
see
him
there
once
,
I
tell
you
 
and
<EOS>
how
could
I
know
he
be
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
irritated
as
I
be
at
their
foolish
mirth
and
vexatious
imputation
,
the
uneasiness
do
not
continue
long
:
 
when
they
have
have
their
laugh
out
,
they
return
again
to
the
captain
and
lieutenant
;
and
,
while
they
dispute
and
comment
upon
them
,
my
indignation
rapidly
cool
;
the
cause
of
it
be
quickly
forget
,
and
I
turn
my
thought
into
a
pleasanter
channel
.
 
<EOS>
thus
we
proceed
up
the
park
,
and
enter
the
hall
;
and
as
I
ascend
the
stair
to
my
own
chamber
,
I
have
<EOS>
but
one
thought
within
me
:
 
<EOS>
my
heart
be
fill
to
overflow
with
one
single
earnest
wish
.
<EOS>
have
enter
the
room
,
and
shut
the
door
,
I
fall
upon
my
knee
and
offer
up
a
fervent
but
not
impetuous
prayer
:
 
<EOS>
"
Thy
will
be
do
,
"
I
strove
to
say
throughout
;
but
,
"
Father
,
all
thing
be
possible
with
Thee
,
and
may
it
be
Thy
will
,
"
be
sure
to
follow
.
<EOS>
that
wish
 
that
prayer
 
<EOS>
both
man
and
woman
would
have
scorn
me
for
"
<EOS>
but
,
Father
,
THOU
wilt
not
despise
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
say
,
and
feel
that
it
be
true
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
that
another
be
welfare
be
at
least
as
ardently
implore
for
as
my
own
;
nay
,
even
that
be
the
principal
object
of
my
heart
's
desire
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
be
deceive
myself
;
but
that
idea
give
me
confidence
to
ask
,
and
power
to
hope
I
do
not
ask
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
the
primrose
,
I
keep
two
of
them
in
a
glass
in
my
room
until
they
be
completely
wither
,
and
the
housemaid
throw
them
out
;
and
the
petal
of
the
other
I
press
between
the
leave
of
my
Bible
 
<EOS>
I
have
them
still
,
and
mean
to
keep
them
always
.
    
<EOS>
the
RECTOR
  
<EOS>
the
follow
day
be
as
fine
as
the
precede
one
.
 
<EOS>
soon
after
breakfast
Miss
Matilda
,
have
gallop
and
blunder
through
a
few
unprofitable
lesson
,
and
vengeably
thump
the
piano
for
an
hour
,
in
a
terrible
humour
with
both
me
and
it
,
because
her
mamma
would
not
give
her
a
holiday
,
have
betake
herself
to
her
favourite
place
of
resort
,
the
yard
,
the
stable
,
and
the
dog
-
kennels
;
and
Miss
Murray
be
go
forth
to
enjoy
a
quiet
ramble
with
a
new
fashionable
novel
for
her
companion
,
leave
me
in
the
schoolroom
hard
at
work
upon
a
water
-
colour
drawing
which
I
have
promise
to
do
for
her
,
and
which
she
insist
upon
my
finishing
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
at
my
foot
lie
a
little
rough
terrier
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
property
of
Miss
Matilda
;
but
she
hate
the
animal
,
and
intend
to
sell
it
,
allege
that
it
be
quite
spoiled
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
really
an
excellent
dog
of
its
kind
;
but
she
affirm
it
be
fit
for
nothing
,
and
have
not
even
the
sense
to
know
its
own
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
the
fact
be
she
have
purchase
it
when
but
a
small
puppy
,
insist
at
first
that
no
one
should
touch
it
but
herself
;
but
soon
become
tired
of
so
helpless
and
troublesome
a
nursling
,
she
have
gladly
yield
to
my
entreaty
to
be
allow
to
take
charge
of
it
;
and
I
,
by
carefully
nurse
the
little
creature
from
infancy
to
adolescence
,
of
course
,
have
obtain
its
affection
:
 
a
reward
I
should
have
greatly
value
,
and
look
upon
as
far
outweigh
all
the
trouble
I
have
have
with
it
,
have
not
poor
Snap
's
grateful
feeling
expose
him
to
many
a
harsh
word
and
many
a
spiteful
kick
and
pinch
from
his
owner
,
and
be
he
not
now
in
danger
of
be
"
put
away
"
in
consequence
,
or
transfer
to
some
rough
,
stony
-
hearted
master
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
could
I
help
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
make
the
dog
hate
me
by
cruel
treatment
,
and
she
would
not
propitiate
him
by
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
while
I
thus
sit
,
work
away
with
my
pencil
,
Mrs.
Murray
come
,
half
-
sailing
,
half
-
bustling
,
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Grey
,
"
she
begin
,
 
"
dear
!
<EOS>
how
can
you
sit
at
your
drawing
such
a
day
as
this
?
"
 
<EOS>
(
She
think
I
be
do
it
for
my
own
pleasure
.
)
 
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
you
do
not
put
on
your
bonnet
and
go
out
with
the
young
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
madam
,
Miss
Murray
be
read
;
and
Miss
Matilda
be
amuse
herself
with
her
dog
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
would
try
to
amuse
Miss
Matilda
yourself
a
little
more
,
I
think
she
would
not
be
drive
to
seek
amusement
in
the
companionship
of
dog
and
horse
and
groom
,
so
much
as
she
be
;
and
if
you
would
be
a
little
more
cheerful
and
conversable
with
Miss
Murray
,
she
would
not
so
often
go
wander
in
the
field
with
a
book
in
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
do
not
want
to
vex
you
,
"
add
she
,
see
,
I
suppose
,
that
my
cheek
burn
and
my
hand
tremble
with
some
unamiable
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
,
pray
,
try
not
to
be
so
touchy
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
speaking
to
you
else
.
 
<EOS>
and
tell
me
if
you
know
where
Rosalie
be
go
:
 
and
why
she
like
to
be
so
much
alone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
say
she
like
to
be
alone
when
she
have
a
new
book
to
read
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
can
not
she
read
it
in
the
park
or
the
garden
?
 
<EOS>
why
should
she
go
into
the
field
and
lane
?
 
<EOS>
and
how
be
it
that
that
Mr.
Hatfield
so
often
find
her
out
?
 
<EOS>
She
tell
me
last
week
he
would
walk
his
horse
by
her
side
all
up
Moss
Lane
;
and
now
I
be
sure
it
be
he
I
see
,
from
my
dressing
-
room
window
,
walk
so
briskly
past
the
park
-
gate
,
and
on
towards
the
field
where
she
so
frequently
go
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
go
and
see
if
she
be
there
;
and
just
gently
remind
her
that
it
be
not
proper
for
a
young
lady
of
her
rank
and
prospect
to
be
wander
about
by
herself
in
that
manner
,
expose
to
the
attention
of
anyone
that
presume
to
address
her
;
like
some
poor
neglect
girl
that
have
no
park
to
walk
in
,
and
no
friend
to
take
care
of
her
:
 
and
tell
her
that
her
papa
would
be
extremely
angry
if
he
know
of
her
treat
Mr.
Hatfield
in
the
familiar
manner
that
I
fear
she
do
;
and
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
if
you
 
if
any
governess
have
<EOS>
but
half
a
mother
's
watchfulness
 
<EOS>
half
a
mother
's
anxious
care
,
I
should
be
save
this
trouble
;
and
you
would
see
at
once
the
necessity
of
keep
your
eye
upon
her
,
and
make
your
company
agreeable
to
 
<EOS>
well
,
go
 
go
;
there
be
no
time
to
be
lose
,
"
cry
she
,
see
that
I
have
put
away
my
drawing
material
,
and
be
wait
in
the
doorway
for
the
conclusion
of
her
address
.
  
<EOS>
accord
to
her
prognostication
,
I
find
Miss
Murray
in
her
favourite
field
just
without
the
park
;
and
,
unfortunately
,
not
alone
;
for
the
tall
,
stately
figure
of
Mr.
Hatfield
be
slowly
saunter
by
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
here
be
a
poser
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
my
duty
to
interrupt
the
tete
-
a-
tete
:
 
but
<EOS>
how
be
it
to
be
do
?
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Hatfield
could
not
to
be
drive
away
by
so
insignificant
person
as
I
;
and
to
go
and
place
myself
on
the
other
side
of
Miss
Murray
,
and
intrude
my
unwelcome
presence
upon
her
without
notice
her
companion
,
be
a
piece
of
rudeness
<EOS>
I
could
not
be
guilty
of
:
 
<EOS>
neither
have
I
the
courage
to
cry
aloud
from
the
top
of
the
field
that
she
be
want
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
so
I
take
the
intermediate
course
of
walk
slowly
but
steadily
towards
them
;
resolve
,
if
my
approach
fail
to
scare
away
the
beau
,
to
pass
by
and
tell
Miss
Murray
her
mamma
want
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
certainly
look
very
charming
as
she
stroll
,
linger
along
under
the
budding
horse
-
chestnut
tree
that
stretch
their
long
arm
over
the
park
-
paling
;
with
her
close
book
in
one
hand
,
and
in
the
other
a
graceful
sprig
of
myrtle
,
which
serve
her
as
a
very
pretty
plaything
;
her
bright
ringlet
escape
profusely
from
her
little
bonnet
,
and
gently
stir
by
the
breeze
,
her
fair
cheek
flush
with
gratified
vanity
,
her
smile
blue
eye
,
now
slyly
glance
towards
her
admirer
,
now
gaze
downward
at
her
myrtle
sprig
.
 
<EOS>
but
Snap
,
run
before
me
,
interrupt
her
in
the
midst
of
some
half
-
pert
,
half
-
playful
repartee
,
by
catch
hold
of
her
dress
and
vehemently
tugging
thereat
;
till
Mr.
Hatfield
,
with
his
cane
,
administer
a
resounding
thwack
upon
the
animal
's
skull
,
and
send
it
yelp
back
to
me
with
a
clamorous
outcry
that
afford
the
reverend
gentleman
great
amusement
:
 
but
see
me
so
near
<EOS>
,
he
think
,
I
suppose
,
he
may
as
well
be
take
his
departure
;
and
,
as
I
stoop
to
caress
the
dog
,
with
ostentatious
pity
to
show
my
disapproval
of
his
severity
<EOS>
,
I
hear
him
say
:
 
"
<EOS>
when
shall
I
see
you
again
,
Miss
Murray
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
at
church
,
I
suppose
,
"
reply
she
,
"
unless
your
business
chance
to
bring
you
here
again
at
the
precise
moment
when
I
happen
to
be
walk
by
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
always
manage
to
have
business
here
,
if
I
know
precisely
when
and
where
to
find
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
I
would
,
I
could
not
inform
you
,
for
I
be
so
immethodical
,
I
never
can
tell
to
-
day
what
I
shall
do
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
give
me
that
,
meantime
,
to
comfort
me
,
"
say
he
,
half
jestingly
and
half
in
earnest
,
extend
his
hand
for
the
sprig
of
myrtle
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
,
I
shall
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
!
<EOS>
PRAY
do
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
the
most
miserable
of
man
if
you
do
not
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
be
so
cruel
as
to
deny
me
a
favour
so
easily
grant
and
yet
so
highly
prized
!
"
<EOS>
plead
he
as
ardently
as
if
his
life
depend
on
it
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
I
stand
within
a
very
few
yard
of
them
,
impatiently
wait
his
departure
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
then
!
<EOS>
take
it
and
go
,
"
say
Rosalie
.
  
<EOS>
He
joyfully
receive
the
gift
,
murmur
something
that
make
her
blush
and
toss
her
head
,
but
with
a
little
laugh
that
show
her
displeasure
be
entirely
affect
;
and
then
with
a
courteous
salutation
withdraw
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
ever
see
such
a
man
,
Miss
Grey
?
"
say
she
,
turn
to
me
;
"
I
be
so
GLAD
<EOS>
you
come
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
never
SHOULD
,
get
rid
of
him
;
and
I
be
so
terribly
afraid
of
papa
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
he
be
with
you
long
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
not
long
,
but
he
be
so
extremely
impertinent
:
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
always
hang
about
,
pretend
his
business
or
his
clerical
duty
<EOS>
require
his
attendance
in
these
part
,
and
really
watch
for
poor
me
,
and
pounce
upon
me
wherever
he
see
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
your
mamma
think
you
ought
not
to
go
beyond
the
park
or
garden
without
some
discreet
,
matronly
person
like
me
to
accompany
you
,
and
keep
off
all
intruder
.
 
<EOS>
She
descry
Mr.
Hatfield
hurry
past
the
park
-
gate
,
and
forthwith
despatch
me
with
instruction
to
seek
you
up
and
to
take
care
of
you
,
and
likewise
to
warn
"
  
"
oh
,
mamma
be
so
tiresome
!
 
<EOS>
as
if
I
could
not
take
care
of
myself
.
<EOS>
She
bother
me
before
about
Mr.
Hatfield
;
and
I
tell
her
she
may
trust
me
:
 
I
never
should
forget
my
rank
and
station
for
the
most
delightful
man
that
ever
breathe
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
he
would
go
down
on
his
knee
to
-
morrow
,
and
implore
me
to
be
his
wife
,
<EOS>
that
I
may
just
show
her
how
mistaken
she
be
in
supposing
that
I
could
ever
 
<EOS>
oh
,
it
provoke
me
so
!
 
<EOS>
to
think
that
I
could
be
such
a
fool
as
to
fall
in
LOVE
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
quite
beneath
the
dignity
of
a
woman
to
do
such
a
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Love
!
 
<EOS>
I
detest
the
word
!
 
<EOS>
as
apply
to
one
of
our
sex
,
I
think
it
a
perfect
insult
.
 
<EOS>
a
preference
I
may
acknowledge
;
but
never
for
one
like
poor
Mr.
Hatfield
,
who
have
not
seven
hundred
a
year
to
bless
himself
with
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
to
talk
to
him
,
because
he
be
so
clever
and
amusing
 
<EOS>
I
wish
Sir
Thomas
Ashby
be
half
as
nice
;
besides
,
I
must
have
SOMEBODY
to
flirt
with
,
and
no
one
else
have
the
sense
to
come
here
;
and
when
we
go
out
,
mamma
will
not
let
me
flirt
with
anybody
<EOS>
but
Sir
Thomas
 
<EOS>
if
he
be
there
;
and
if
he
be
not
there
,
I
be
bind
hand
and
foot
,
for
fear
somebody
should
go
and
make
up
some
exaggerated
story
,
and
put
it
into
his
head
that
I
be
engage
,
or
likely
to
be
engage
,
to
somebody
else
;
or
,
what
be
more
probable
,
for
fear
his
nasty
old
mother
should
see
or
hear
of
my
ongoing
,
and
conclude
that
I
be
not
a
fit
wife
for
her
excellent
son
:
 
as
if
the
say
son
be
not
the
great
scamp
in
Christendom
;
and
as
if
any
woman
of
common
decency
be
not
a
world
too
good
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
really
so
,
Miss
Murray
?
<EOS>
and
do
your
mamma
know
it
,
and
yet
wish
you
to
marry
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
,
she
do
!
 
<EOS>
She
know
more
against
him
than
I
do
,
I
believe
:
 
she
keep
it
from
me
lest
I
should
be
discourage
;
not
know
how
little
I
care
about
such
thing
.
 
<EOS>
for
it
be
no
great
matter
,
really
:
 
he
will
be
all
right
when
he
be
married
,
as
mamma
say
;
and
reform
rake
make
the
good
husband
,
EVERYBODY
know
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
he
be
not
so
ugly
 
THAT"S
<EOS>
all
I
think
about
:
 
<EOS>
but
then
there
be
no
choice
here
in
the
country
;
and
papa
WILL
not
let
us
go
to
London
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
should
think
Mr.
Hatfield
would
be
far
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
he
would
,
if
he
be
lord
of
Ashby
Park
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
doubt
of
it
:
 
<EOS>
but
the
fact
be
,
I
MUST
have
Ashby
Park
,
whoever
share
it
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
Mr.
Hatfield
think
you
like
him
all
this
time
;
you
do
not
consider
how
bitterly
he
will
be
disappointed
when
he
find
himself
mistaken
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
proper
punishment
for
his
presumption
 
for
ever
dare
to
think
I
could
like
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
enjoy
nothing
so
much
as
lift
the
veil
from
his
eye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
sooner
you
do
it
the
well
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
tell
you
,
I
like
to
amuse
myself
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
he
do
not
really
think
I
like
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
good
care
of
that
:
 
<EOS>
you
do
not
know
how
cleverly
I
manage
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
presume
to
think
he
can
induce
me
to
like
him
;
for
which
I
shall
punish
him
as
he
deserve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
mind
you
do
not
give
too
much
reason
for
such
presumption
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
,
"
reply
i.
  
<EOS>
but
all
my
exhortation
be
in
vain
:
 
<EOS>
they
only
make
her
somewhat
more
solicitous
to
disguise
her
wish
and
her
thought
from
me
.
<EOS>
She
talk
no
more
to
me
about
the
rector
;
but
I
could
see
that
her
mind
,
if
not
her
heart
,
be
fix
upon
him
still
,
and
that
she
be
intent
upon
obtain
another
interview
:
 
for
though
,
in
compliance
with
her
mother
's
request
,
I
be
now
constitute
the
companion
of
her
ramble
for
a
time
,
she
still
persist
in
wander
in
the
field
and
lane
that
lie
in
the
near
proximity
to
the
road
;
and
,
whether
she
talk
to
me
or
read
the
book
she
carry
in
her
hand
,
she
keep
continually
pause
to
look
round
her
,
or
gaze
up
the
road
to
see
if
anyone
be
come
;
and
if
a
horseman
trot
by
,
I
could
tell
by
her
unqualified
abuse
of
the
poor
equestrian
,
whoever
he
may
be
,
that
she
hate
him
because
he
be
not
Mr.
Hatfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
surely
,
"
think
I
,
"
she
be
not
so
indifferent
to
him
as
she
believe
herself
to
be
,
or
would
have
other
to
believe
her
;
and
her
mother
's
anxiety
be
not
so
wholly
causeless
as
she
affirm
.
<EOS>
"
  
three
day
pass
away
,
and
he
do
not
make
his
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
afternoon
of
the
fourth
,
as
we
be
walk
beside
the
park
-
paling
in
the
memorable
field

each
furnish
with
a
book
(

I

myself
with
something
to

out

what
you

to
finish

it

not
you
better

him
a
bit

to

some

of
a
good
book

I
do
as
I

desire

,
suspect
something
from
her
hurried
manner

the
suddenness
of
the
request

I
just
glance
back
before
I
quit
the
field

there
be
Mr.
Hatfield
about
to
enter
at

me
to
the
house

a
book

my
meeting
him
on

road

"
never
mind
!

I

there
will
be
no
great
harm
do

<EOS>
Poor
Mark
will
be
glad
of
the
half
-
crown
,
and
perhaps
of
the
good
book
too
;
and
if
the
rector
do
steal
Miss
Rosalie
's
heart
,
it
will
only
humble
her
pride
a
little
;
and
if
they
do
get
marry
at
last
,
it
will
only
save
her
from
a
bad
fate
;
and
she
will
be
quite
a
good
enough
partner
for
him
,
and
he
for
her

Mark

the

<EOS>
Miss
Murray
,
by
her
liberality
,
obtain
literally
the
blessing
of
him
that
be
ready
to
perish
;
for
though
the
half
-
crown
could
be
of
very
little
service
to
him
,
he
be
glad
of
it
for
the
sake
of
his
wife
and
child
,
so
soon
to
be
widow
and
fatherless
.
 
<EOS>
after
I
have
sit
a
few
minute
,
and
read
a
little
for
the
comfort
and
edification
of
himself
and
his
afflict
wife
,
I
leave
them
;
but
I
have
not
proceed
fifty
yard
before
I
encounter
Mr.
Weston
,
apparently
on
his
way
to
the
same
abode
.
 
<EOS>
He
greet
me
in
his
usual
quiet
,
unaffected
way
,
stop
to
inquire
about
the
condition
of
the
sick
man
and
his
family
,
and
with
a
sort
of
unconscious
,
brotherly
disregard
to
ceremony
take
from
my
hand
the
book
out
of
which
I
have
be
read
,
turn
over
its
page
,
make
a
few
brief
but
very
sensible
remark
,
and
restore
it
;
then
tell
me
about
some
poor
sufferer
he
have
just
be
visit
,
talk
a
little
about
Nancy
Brown
,
make
a
few
observation
upon
my
little
rough
friend
the
terrier
,
that
be
frisk
at
his
foot
,
and
finally
upon
the
beauty
of
the
weather
,
and
depart
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
omit
to
give
a
detail
of
his
word
,
from
a
notion
that
they
would
not
interest
the
reader
as
they
do
me
,
and
not
because
I
have
forget
them
.
 
<EOS>
no
<EOS>
;
I
remember
them
well
;
for
I
think
them
over
and
over
again
in
the
course
of
that
day
and
many
succeed
one
,
I
know
not
how
often
;
and
recall
every
intonation
of
his
deep
,
clear
voice
,
every
flash
of
his
quick
,
brown
eye
,
and
every
gleam
of
his
pleasant
,
but
too
transient
smile
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
confession
will
look
very
absurd
,
I
fear
:
 
<EOS>
but
no
matter
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
write
it
:
 
and
they
that
read
it
will
not
know
the
writer

I
be
walk
along
,
happy
within
,
and
please
with
all
around

Miss
Murray
come
hasten
to
meet
me
;
her
buoyant
step

flushed
cheek
,

radiant
smile
show
that
she

too

be
happy

in
her
own

<EOS>
run
up
to
me

she
put
her

through

without

breath

begin

now
,
Miss

think
yourself
highly
honour

I
be
come
to
tell
you
my
news
before
I
have
breathe
a
word
of
it
to
anyone
else

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
what
be
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
SUCH
news
!
 
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
you
must
know
that
Mr.
Hatfield
come
upon
me
just
after
you
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
such
a
way
for
fear
papa
or
mamma
<EOS>
should
see
him
;
but
you
know
I
could
not
call
you
back
again
,
and
so
!
 
<EOS>
oh
,
dear
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
you
all
about
it
now
,
for
there
be
Matilda
<EOS>
,
I
see
,
in
the
park
,
and
I
must
go
and
open
my
budget
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
Hatfield
be
most
uncommonly
audacious
,
unspeakably
complimentary
,
and
unprecedentedly
tender
 
<EOS>
try
to
be
so
,
at
least
 
he
do
not
succeed
very
well
in
that
,
because
it
be
not
his
vein
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
all
he
say
another
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
what
do
you
say
 
<EOS>
I
be
more
interested
in
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
that
,
too
,
at
some
future
period
.
 
<EOS>
I
happen
to
be
in
a
very
good
humour
just
then
;
but
,
though
I
be
complaisant
and
gracious
enough
,
I
take
care
not
to
compromise
myself
in
any
possible
way
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
the
conceited
wretch
choose
to
interpret
my
amiability
of
temper
his
own
way
,
and
at
length
presume
upon
my
indulgence
so
far
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
?
 
<EOS>
he
actually
make
me
an
offer
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
"
  
"
I
proudly
draw
myself
up
,
and
with
the
great
coolness
express
my
astonishment
at
such
an
occurrence
,
and
hope
he
have
see
nothing
in
my
conduct
to
justify
his
expectation
.
 
<EOS>
You
should
have
see
how
his
countenance
fall
!
 
<EOS>
He
go
perfectly
white
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
him
that
I
esteem
him
and
all
that
,
but
could
not
possibly
accede
to
his
proposal
;
and
if
I
do
,
papa
and
mamma
could
never
be
bring
to
give
their
consent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
but
if
they
could
,
"
say
he
,
"
would
yours
be
want
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
"
certainly
,
Mr.
Hatfield
,
"
I
reply
,
with
a
cool
decision
which
quell
all
hope
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
if
you
have
see
how
dreadfully
mortify
he
be
 
how
crush
to
the
earth
by
his
disappointment
!
<EOS>
really
,
I
almost
pity
him
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
one
more
desperate
attempt
,
however
,
he
make
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
silence
of
considerable
duration
,
during
which
he
struggle
to
be
calm
,
and
I
to
be
grave
 
<EOS>
for
I
feel
a
strong
propensity
to
laugh
 
which
would
have
ruin
all
 
he
say
,
with
the
ghost
of
a
smile
 
"
<EOS>
but
tell
me
plainly
,
Miss
Murray
,
if
I
have
the
wealth
of
Sir
Hugh
Meltham
,
or
the
prospect
of
his
eld
son
,
would
you
still
refuse
me
?
 
<EOS>
answer
me
truly
,
upon
your
honour
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
"
certainly
,
"
say
I.
 
"
that
would
make
no
difference
whatever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
great
lie
,
but
he
look
so
confident
in
his
own
attraction
still
,
that
I
determine
not
to
leave
him
one
stone
upon
another
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
me
full
in
the
face
;
but
I
keep
my
countenance
so
well
that
he
could
not
imagine
I
be
say
anything
more
than
the
actual
truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
then
it
be
all
over
,
I
suppose
,
"
he
say
,
look
as
if
he
could
have
die
on
the
spot
with
vexation
and
the
intensity
of
his
despair
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
angry
as
well
as
disappoint
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
he
,
suffer
so
unspeakably
,
and
there
be
I
,
the
pitiless
cause
of
it
all
,
so
utterly
impenetrable
to
all
the
artillery
of
his
look
and
word
,
so
calmly
cold
and
proud
,
he
could
not
but
feel
some
resentment
;
and
with
singular
bitterness
he
begin
 
"
I
certainly
do
not
expect
this
,
Miss
Murray
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
say
something
about
your
past
conduct
,
and
the
hope
you
have
lead
me
to
foster
,
but
I
forbear
,
on
condition
"
  
"
"
no
condition
,
Mr.
Hatfield
!
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
now
truly
indignant
at
his
insolence
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
then
let
me
beg
it
as
a
favour
,
"
he
reply
,
lower
his
voice
at
once
,
and
take
a
humbler
tone
:
 
<EOS>
"
let
me
entreat
that
you
will
not
mention
this
affair
to
anyone
whatever
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
will
keep
silence
about
it
,
there
need
be
no
unpleasantness
on
either
side
 
nothing
,
I
mean
,
beyond
what
be
quite
unavoidable
:
 
for
my
own
feeling
<EOS>
I
will
endeavour
to
keep
to
myself
,
if
I
can
not
annihilate
them
 
I
will
try
to
forgive
,
if
I
can
not
forget
the
cause
of
my
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
suppose
,
Miss
Murray
,
that
you
know
how
deeply
you
have
injure
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
you
aware
of
it
;
but
if
,
in
addition
to
the
injury
you
have
already
do
me
 
pardon
me

,
whether
innocently
or
not

you
have
do
it

if
you
add
to
it

give
publicity
to
this
unfortunate
affair

name
it
AT
all

you
will
find
that
I
too
can
speak

though
you
scorn
my
love
,
you
will
hardly
scorn
my

"
He
stop
,
but
he
bite
his
bloodless
lip
,
and
look
so
terribly
fierce
that
I
be
quite
frightened
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
my
pride
uphold
me
still
,
and
I
answer
disdainfully
;
"
I
do
not
know
what
motive
<EOS>
you
suppose
I
could
have
for

it
to
anyone

Mr.

if
I

dispose
to
do
so

you
would
not
deter
me
by
threat

it

scarcely
the
part

to
attempt
it

still
adore
you
so
deeply

though
I
never

never

love
any
woman

I

it

equally
certain
that

so
ill

the
novelty

harshness
of

lesson
you

me
to

day

the
bitterness

be
disappoint
in

only
quarter

the
happiness

must
excuse
any

about

how
little
I

some

incline
to
hate
one

surpassing
loveliness
have
so
completely
estrange
my

blind
me

a

hint
of
the

ready

with
passion

I
mean
that
this
affair
from
begin

end
appear
to
me
like
a
case
of
arrant
flirtation
,
to
say
the
least
of
it
 
such
a
case
as
you
would
find
it
rather
inconvenient
to
have
blazon
through
the
world

with
the
addition

exaggeration
of
your
female
rival

publish
the

he
turn

away

Brown
immediately

if
you
do
not
tell
her
yourself

Brown
will
blazon
it

or
be
the
mean
of
blazon
it
,
throughout
the
country

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

indeed

she

not

at
all

it
be
under
the
promise

how
can
you

her
promise
well

her

<EOS>
"
well

well

she
shall
not

it

tell
your

oh

wonder
what
it

delighted
you
so
much

"
<EOS>
yes
;
and
another
thing
be
,
that
I
have
humble
Mr.
Hatfield
so
charmingly
;
and
another
 
<EOS>
why
,
you
must
allow
me
some
share
of
female
vanity
:
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
be
without
that
most
essential
attribute
of
our
sex
 
<EOS>
and
if
you
have
see
poor
Hatfield
's
intense
eagerness
in
make
his
ardent
declaration
and
his
flattering
proposal
,
and
his
agony
of
mind
,
that
no
effort
of
pride
could
conceal
,
on
be
refuse
,
you
would
have
allow
I
have
some
cause
to
be
gratify
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
great
his
agony
,
I
should
think
,
the
less
your
cause
for
gratification
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
nonsense
!
"
cry
the
young
lady

shake
herself
with
vexation

"
You
either
can
not
understand
me

you
will
not

<EOS>
if
I
have
not
confidence
in
your
magnanimity
,
I
should
think
you
envy
me

<EOS>
but
you
will
,
perhaps
,
comprehend
this
cause
of
pleasure
 
which
be
as
great
as
any
 
namely
,
that
I
be
delighted
with
myself
for
my
prudence
,
my
self

command
,
my
heartlessness
,
if
you

<EOS>
I
be
not
a
bit
take
by
surprise

not
a
bit
confused
,

awkward
,
or
foolish

I
just
act

as
I
ought

completely
my

here
be

decidedly
good

look
 
Jane

call
him
bewitchingly
handsome

I
suppose
they
be
two
of
the
lady
he
pretend
would
be
so
glad
to
have
him
;
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
he
be
certainly
a
very
clever
,
witty
,
agreeable
companion
 
<EOS>
not
what
you
call
clever
,
but
just
enough
to
make
him
entertaining
;
and
a
man
one
nee
not
be
ashamed
of
anywhere
,
and
would
not
soon
grow
tired
of
;
and
to
confess
the
truth
<EOS>
,
I
rather
like
him
 
better
even
,
of
late

than
Harry
Meltham
 
<EOS>

he
evidently
idolise
me

<EOS>
yet
,
though
he
come
upon
me
all
alone

unprepared

I
have
the
wisdom

and
the
pride
,

the
strength
to
refuse
him

so
scornfully

coolly
as
I
do

I
have
good
reason
to
be
proud

make
no
difference

you

when
that
be
not
the

of
have
promise

what

You

I

you

about

<EOS>
She
leave
me

offend
at
my
want
of
sympathy
,
and
thinking
,
no

,
that
I
envy
her

<EOS>
I
do
not
 
at

I
firmly
believe
I
do
not

<EOS>
I
be
sorry
for
her
;
I
be
amazed
,
disgust
at
her
heartless
vanity

I
wonder
why
so
much
beauty
should
be
give
to
those
who
make
so
bad
a
use
of
it

and
deny
to
some
who
would
make
it
a
benefit
to
both
themselves

<EOS>
but
,
God
know
best

I
conclude

<EOS>
there
be
,
I
suppose
,
some
man
as
vain
,
as
selfish
,
and
as
heartless
as
she
be
,
and
,
perhaps
,
such
woman
may
be
useful
to
punish
them

the
WALK

oh

precipitate

Rosalie
next
day
at
four
P.M.

as
,
with
a
portentous
yawn
<EOS>
,
she
lay
down
her
worst
-
work

look
listlessly
towards
the
window

<EOS>

there
be
no
inducement

go
out

nothing
to
look
forward

<EOS>
the
day
will
be
so
long
and
dull
when
there
be
no
party
to
enliven
them
;

there
be
none
this
week

or
next
either
,
that
I
know
of

"
  
<EOS>
"
pity
you
be
so
cross
to
him
,
"
observe
Matilda
,
to
whom
this
lamentation
be
address
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
will
never
come
again
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
suspect
you
like
him
after
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
would
have
take
him
for
your
beau
,
and
leave
dear
Harry
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
<EOS>
my
beau
must
be
an
Adonis
indeed
,
Matilda
,
the
admire
of
all
beholder
,
if
I
be
to
be
content
with
him
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
lose
Hatfield
<EOS>
,
I
confess
;
but
the
first
decent
man
,
or
number
of
man
,
that
come
to
supply
his
place
,
will
be
more
than
welcome
.
<EOS>
It
be
Sunday
to
-
morrow
 
<EOS>
I
do
wonder
how
he
will
look
,
and
whether
he
will
be
able
to
go
through
the
service
.
 
<EOS>
most
likely
he
will
pretend
he
be
get
a
cold
,
and
make
Mr.
Weston
do
it
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
he
!
<EOS>
"
exclaim
Matilda
,
somewhat
contemptuously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fool
as
he
be
<EOS>
,
he
be
not
so
soft
as
that
come
to
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
sister
be
slightly
offend
;
but
the
event
prove
Matilda
be
right
:
 
the
disappointed
lover
perform
his
pastoral
duty
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
Rosalie
,
indeed
,
affirm
he
look
very
pale
and
dejected
:
he
may
be
a
little
paler
;
but
the
difference
,
if
any
,
be
scarcely
perceptible
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
his
dejection
,
I
certainly
do
not
hear
his
laugh
ring
from
the
vestry
as
usual
,
nor
his
voice
loud
in
hilarious
discourse
;
though
I
do
hear
it
uplifted
in
rate
the
sexton
in
a
manner
that
make
the
congregation
stare
;
and
,
in
his
transit
to
and
from
the
pulpit
and
the
communion
-
table
,
there
be
more
of
solemn
pomp
,
and
less
of
that
irreverent
,
self
-
confident
,
or
rather
self
-
delighted
imperiousness
with
which
he
usually
sweep
along
 
that
air
that
seem
to
say
,
"
You
all
reverence
and
adore
me
,
I
know
;
<EOS>
but
if
anyone
do
not
,
I
defy
him
to
the
tooth
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
the
most
remarkable
change
be
,
that
he
never
once
suffer
his
eye
to
wander
in
the
direction
of
Mr.
Murray
's
pew
,
and
do
not
leave
the
church
till
we
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Hatfield
have
doubtless
receive
a
very
severe
blow
;
but
his
pride
impel
him
to
use
every
effort
to
conceal
the
effect
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
disappoint
in
his
certain
hope
of
obtain
not
only
a
beautiful
,
and
,
to
him
,
highly
attractive
wife
,
but
one
whose
rank
and
fortune
may
give
brilliance
to
far
inferior
charm
:
 
<EOS>
he
be
likewise
,
no
doubt
,
intensely
mortify
by
his
repulse
,
and
deeply
offend
at
the
conduct
of
Miss
Murray
throughout
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
give
him
no
little
consolation
to
have
know
how
disappointed
she
be
to
find
him
apparently
so
little
moved
,
and
to
see
that
he
be
able
to
refrain
from
cast
a
single
glance
at
her
throughout
both
service
;
though
,
she
declare
,
it
show
he
be
think
of
her
all
the
time
,
or
his
eye
would
have
fall
upon
her
,
if
it
be
only
by
chance
:
 
<EOS>
but
if
they
have
so
chance
to
fall
,
she
would
have
affirm
it
be
because
they
could
not
resist
the
attraction
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
have
please
him
,
too
,
in
some
degree
,
to
have
see
how
dull
and
dissatisfied
she
be
throughout
that
week
(
the
great
part
of
it
,
at
least
)
,
for
lack
of
her
usual
source
of
excitement
;
and
how
often
she
regret
have
"
use
him
up
so
soon
,
"
like
a
child
that
,
have
devour
its
plumcake
too
hastily
,
sit
suck
its
finger
,
and
vainly
lament
its
greediness
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
I
be
call
upon
,
one
fine
morning
,
to
accompany
her
in
a
walk
to
the
village
.
 
<EOS>
ostensibly
she
go
to
get
some
shade
of
Berlin
wool
,
at
a
tolerably
respectable
shop
that
be
chiefly
support
by
the
lady
of
the
vicinity
:
 
<EOS>
really
 
I
trust
there
be
no
breach
of
charity
in
supposing
that
she
go
with
the
idea
of
meet
either
with
the
rector
himself
,
or
some
other
admirer
by
the
way
;
for
as
we
go
along
,
she
keep
wonder
"
what
Hatfield
would
do
or
say
,
if
we
meet
him
,
"
&
c.
&
c.
;
as
we
pass
Mr.
Green
's
park
-
gate
<EOS>
,
she
"
wonder
whether
he
be
at
home
 
great
stupid
blockhead
"
;
as
Lady
Meltham
's
carriage
pass
us
,
she
"
wonder
what
Mr.
Harry
be
do
this
fine
day
"
;
and
then
begin
to
abuse
his
eld
brother
for
be
"
such
a
fool
as
to
get
married
and
go
and
live
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
think
you
want
to
live
in
London
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
because
it
be
so
dull
here
:
 
but
then
he
make
it
still
duller
by
take
himself
off
:
 
<EOS>
and
if
he
be
not
married
I
may
have
him
instead
of
that
odious
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
,
observe
the
print
of
a
horse
's
foot
on
the
somewhat
miry
road
,
she
"
wonder
whether
it
be
a
gentleman
's
horse
,
"
and
finally
conclude
it
be
,
for
the
impression
be
too
small
to
have
be
make
by
a
"
great
clumsy
cart
-
horse
"
;
and
then
she
"
wonder
who
the
rider
could
be
,
"
and
whether
we
should
meet
him
come
back
,
for
she
be
sure
he
have
only
pass
that
morning
;
and
lastly
,
when
we
enter
the
village
and
see
only
a
few
of
its
humble
inhabitant
move
about
,
she
"
wonder
why
the
stupid
people
could
not
keep
in
their
house
<EOS>
;
she
be
sure
she
do
not
want
to
see
their
ugly
face
,
and
dirty
,
vulgar
clothe
 
<EOS>
it
be
not
for
that
she
come
to
Horton
!
"
  
<EOS>
amid
all
this
,
I
confess
,
I
wonder
,
too
,
in
secret
,
whether
we
should
meet
,
or
catch
a
glimpse
of
somebody
else
;
and
as
we
pass
his
lodging
,
I
even
go
so
far
as
to
wonder
whether
he
be
at
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
on
enter
the
shop
,
Miss
Murray
desire
me
to
stand
in
the
doorway
while
she
transact
her
business
,
and
tell
her
if
anyone
pass
.
 
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
there
be
no
one
visible
besides
the
villager
,
except
Jane
and
Susan
Green
come
down
the
single
street
,
apparently
return
from
a
walk
.
  
<EOS>
"
stupid
thing
!
"
<EOS>
mutter
she
,
as
she
come
out
after
have
conclude
her
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
could
not
they
have
their
dolt
of
a
brother
with
them
?
<EOS>
even
he
would
be
well
than
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
greet
them
,
however
,
with
a
cheerful
smile
,
and
protestation
of
pleasure
at
the
happy
meeting
equal
to
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
They
place
themselves
one
on
each
side
of
her
,
and
all
three
walk
away
chat
and
laugh
as
young
lady
do
when
they
get
together
,
if
they
be
but
on
tolerably
intimate
term
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
,
feel
myself
to
be
one
too
many
,
leave
them
to
their
merriment
and
lag
behind
,
as
usual
on
such
occasion
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
relish
for
walk
beside
Miss
Green
or
Miss
Susan
like
one
deaf
and
dumb
,
who
could
neither
speak
nor
be
speak
to
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
time
I
be
not
long
alone
.
 
<EOS>
It
strike
me
,
first
,
as
very
odd
,
that
just
as
I
be
think
about
Mr.
Weston
he
should
come
up
and
accost
me
;
but
afterwards
,
on
due
reflection
<EOS>
,
I
think
there
be
nothing
odd
about
it
,
unless
it
be
the
fact
of
his
speak
to
me
;
for
on
such
a
morning
and
so
near
his
own
abode
,
it
be
natural
enough
that
he
should
be
about
;
and
as
for
my
thinking
of
him
,
I
have
be
do
that
,
with
little
intermission
,
ever
since
we
set
out
on
our
journey
;
so
there
be
nothing
remarkable
in
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
alone
again
,
Miss
Grey
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
kind
of
people
be
those
lady
 
the
Misses
Green
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
strange
 
<EOS>
when
you
live
so
near
and
see
them
so
often
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
suppose
they
be
lively
,
good
-
temper
girl
;
but
I
imagine
you
must
know
them

than
I
do

yourself

I
never
exchange
a
word
with
either
of
them

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
indeed
?
 
<EOS>
They
do
not
strike
me
as
be
particularly
reserve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
likely
they
be
not
so
to
people
of
their
own
class
<EOS>
;
but
they
consider
themselves
as
move
in
quite
a
different
sphere
from
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
make
no
reply
to
this
:
 
but
after
a
short
pause
,
he
say
,
 
"
I
suppose
it
be
these
thing
,
Miss
Grey
,
that
make
you
think
you
could
not
live
without
a
home
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
not
exactly
.
 
<EOS>
the
fact
be
I
be
too
socially
disposed
to
be
able
to
live
contentedly
without
a
friend
;
and
as
the
only
friend
I
have
,
or
be
likely
to
have
,
be
at
home
,
if
it
 
or
rather
,
if
they
be
go
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
I
could
not
live
 
<EOS>
but
I
would
rather
not
live
in
such
a
desolate
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
do
you
say
the
only
friend
you
be
likely
to
have
?
 
<EOS>
be
you
so
unsociable
that
you
can
not
make
friend
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
but
I
never
make
one
yet
;
and
in
my
present
position
there
be
no
possibility
of
do
so
,
or
even
of
form
a
common
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
the
fault
may
be
partly
in
myself
,
but
I
hope
not
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
fault
be
partly
in
society
,
and
partly
,
I
should
think
,
in
your
immediate
neighbour
:
 
and
partly
,
too
,
in
yourself
;
for
many
lady
,
in
your
position
,
would
make
themselves
be
notice
and
account
of
.
 
<EOS>
but
your
pupil
should
be
companion
for
you
in
some
degree
;
they
can
not
be
many
year
young
than
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
they
be
good
company
sometimes
;
but
I
can
not
call
them
friend
,
nor
would
they
think
of
bestow
such
a
name
on
me
 
<EOS>
they
have
other
companion
better
suit
to
their
taste

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
you
be
too
wise
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
how
do
you
amuse
yourself
when
alone
 
<EOS>
do
you
read
much
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
reading
be
my
favourite
occupation
,
when
I
have
leisure
for
it
and
book
to
read
.
"
  
<EOS>
from
speak
of
book
in
general
,
he
pass
to
different
book
in
particular
,
and
proceed
by
rapid
transition
from
topic
to
topic
,
till
several
matter
,
both
of
taste
and
opinion
,
have
be
discuss
considerably
within
the
space
of
half
an
hour
,
but
without
the
embellishment
of
many
observation
from
himself
;
he
be
evidently
less
bent
upon
communicate
his
own
thought
and
predilection
,
than
on
discover
mine
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
the
tact
,
or
the
art
,
to
effect
such
a
purpose
by
skilfully
draw
out
my
sentiment
or
idea
through
the
real
or
apparent
statement
of
his
own
,
or
lead
the
conversation
by
imperceptible
gradation
to
such
topic
as
he
wish
to
advert
to
:
 
but
such
gentle
abruptness
,
and
such
single
-
minded
straightforwardness
,
could
not
possibly
offend
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
should
he
interest
himself
at
all
in
my
moral
and
intellectual
capacity
:
 
<EOS>
what
be
it
to
him
what
I
think
or
feel
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
myself
.
 
<EOS>
and
my
heart
throb
in
answer
to
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
but
Jane
and
Susan
Green
soon
reach
their
home
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
stand
parley
at
the
park
-
gate
,
attempt
to
persuade
Miss
Murray
to
come
in
,
I
wish
Mr.
Weston
would
go
,
that
she
may
not
see
him
with
me
when
she
turn
round
;
but
,
unfortunately
,
his
business
,
which
be
to
pay
one
more
visit
to
poor
Mark
Wood
,
lead
him
to
pursue
the
same
path
as
we
do
,
till
nearly
the
close
of
our
journey
.
 
<EOS>
when
,
however
,
he
see
that
Rosalie
have
take
leave
of
her
friend
<EOS>
and
I
be
about
to
join
her
,
he
would
have
leave
me
and
pass
on
at
a
quick
pace
;
but
,
as
he
civilly
lift
his
hat
in
pass
her
,
to
my
surprise
,
instead
of
return
the
salute
with
a
stiff
,
ungracious
bow
,
she
accost
him
with
one
of
her
sweetest
smile
,
and
,
walk
by
his
side
,
begin
to
talk
to
him
with
all
imaginable
cheerfulness
and
affability
;
and
so
we
proceed
all
three
together
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
short
pause
in
the
conversation
,
Mr.
Weston
make
some
remark
address
particularly
to
me
,
as
refer
to
something
we
have
be
talk
of
before
;
but
before
I
could
answer
,
Miss
Murray
reply
to
the
observation
and
enlarge
upon
it
:
 
he
rejoin
;
and
,
from
thence
to
the
close
of
the
interview
,
she
engross
him
entirely
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
partly
owing
to
my
own
stupidity
,
my
want
of
tact
and
assurance
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
feel
myself
wrong
:
 
<EOS>
I
tremble
with
apprehension
;
and
I
listen
with
envy
to
her
easy
,
rapid
flow
of
utterance
,
and
see
with
anxiety
the
bright
smile
with
which
she
look
into
his
face
from
time
to
time
:
 
for
she
be
walk
a
little
in
advance
,
for
the
purpose
(
as
I
judge
)
of
be
see
as
well
as
hear
.
 
<EOS>
if
her
conversation
be
light
and
trivial
,
it
be
amusing
,
and
she
be
never
at
a
loss
for
something
to
say
,
or
for
suitable
word
to
express
it
in
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
pert
or
flippant
in
her
manner
now
,
as
when
she
walk
with
Mr.
Hatfield
,
there
be
only
a
gentle
,
playful
kind
of
vivacity
,
which
I
think
must
be
peculiarly
pleasing
to
a
man
of
Mr.
Weston
's
disposition
and
temperament
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
be
go
she
begin
to
laugh
,
and
mutter
to
herself
,
"
I
think
I
could
do
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
what
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
fix
that
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
he
will
go
home
and
dream
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
shoot
him
through
the
heart
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
by
many
infallible
proof
:
 
more
especially
the
look
he
give
me
when
he
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
an
impudent
look
 
<EOS>
I
exonerate
him
from
that
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
look
of
reverential
,
tender
adoration
.
 
<EOS>
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
he
be
not
quite
such
a
stupid
blockhead
as
I
think
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
make
no
answer
,
for
my
heart
be
in
my
throat
,
or
something
like
it
,
and
I
could
not
trust
myself
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
"
o
God
,
avert
it
!
<EOS>
"
I
cry
,
internally
"
for
his
sake
,
not
for
mine
!
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Murray
make
several
trivial
observation
as
we
pass
up
the
park
,
to
which
(
in
spite
of
my
reluctance
to
let
one
glimpse
of
my
feeling
appear
)
<EOS>
I
could
only
answer
by
monosyllable
.
 
<EOS>
whether
she
intend
to
torment
me
,
or
merely
to
amuse
herself
,
I
could
not
tell
 
and
do
not
much
care
;
but
I
think
of
the
poor
man
and
his
one
lamb
,
and
the
rich
man
with
his
thousand
flock
;
and
I
dread
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
for
Mr.
Weston
,
independently
of
my
own
blighted
hope
.
  
<EOS>
right
glad
be
I
to
get
into
the
house
,
and
find
myself
alone
once
more
in
my
own
room
.
 
<EOS>
My
first
impulse
be
to
sink
into
the
chair
beside
the
bed
;
and
lay
my
head
on
the
pillow
,
to
seek
relief
in
a
passionate
burst
of
tear
:
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
imperative
craving
for
such
an
indulgence
;
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
I
must
restrain
and
swallow
back
my
feeling
still
:
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
bell
 
the
odious
bell
for
the
schoolroom
dinner
;
and
I
must
go
down
with
a
calm
face
,
and
smile
,
and
laugh
,
and
talk
nonsense
 
yes
,
and
eat
,
too
,
if
possible
,
as
if
all
be
right
,
and
I
be
just
return
from
a
pleasant
walk
.
    
<EOS>
the
substitution
  
<EOS>
next
Sunday
be
one
of
the
gloomiest
of
April
day
 
a
day
of
thick
,
dark
cloud
,
and
heavy
shower
.
 
<EOS>
none
of
the
Murrays
be
dispose
to
attend
church
in
the
afternoon
,
except
Rosalie
:
 
<EOS>
she
be
bent
upon
go
as
usual
;
so
she
order
the
carriage
,
and
I
go
with
her
:
 
nothing
loth
,
of
course
,
for
at
church
<EOS>
I
may
look
without
fear
of
scorn
or
censure
upon
a
form
and
face
more
pleasing
to
me
than
the
most
beautiful
of
God
's
creation
;
I
may
listen
without
disturbance
to
a
voice
more
charming
than
the
sweetest
music
to
my
ear
;
I
may
seem
to
hold
communion
with
that
soul
in
which
I
feel
so
deeply
interested
,
and
imbibe
its
pure
thought
and
holy
aspiration
,
with
no
alloy
to
such
felicity
except
the
secret
reproach
of
my
conscience
,
which
would
too
often
whisper
that
I
be
deceive
my
own
self
,
and
mock
God
with
the
service
of
a
heart
more
bent
upon
the
creature
than
the
Creator
.
  
<EOS>
sometimes
,
such
thought
would
give
me
trouble
enough
;
but
sometimes
I
could
quiet
them
with
think
 
<EOS>
it
be
not
the
man
,
it
be
his
goodness
that
I
love
.
 
<EOS>
"
whatsoever
thing
be
pure
,
whatsoever
thing
be
lovely
,
whatsoever
thing
be
honest
and
of
good
report
,
think
on
these
thing
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
do
well
to
worship
God
in
His
work
;
and
I
know
none
of
them
in
which
so
many
of
His
attribute
 
so
much
of
His
own
spirit
shine
,
as
in
this
His
faithful
servant
;
whom
to
know
and
not
to
appreciate
,
be
obtuse
insensibility
in
me
,
who
have
so
little
else
to
occupy
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
almost
immediately
after
the
conclusion
of
the
service
,
Miss
Murray
leave
the
church
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
to
stand
in
the
porch
,
for
it
be
rain
,
and
the
carriage
be
not
yet
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
at
her
come
forth
so
hastily
,
for
neither
young
Meltham
nor
Squire
Green
<EOS>
be
there
;
but
I
soon
find
it
be
to
secure
an
interview
with
Mr.
Weston
as
he
come
out
,
which
he
presently
do
.
 
<EOS>
have
salute
us
both
,
he
would
have
pass
on
,
but
she
detain
him
;
first
with
observation
upon
the
disagreeable
weather
,
and
then
with
ask
if
he
would
be
so
kind
as
to
come
some
time
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
to
see
the
granddaughter
of
the
old
woman
who
keep
the
porter
's
lodge
,
for
the
girl
be
ill
of
a
fever
,
and
wish
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
promise
to
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
at
what
time
will
you
be
most
likely
to
come
,
Mr.
Weston
?
 
<EOS>
the
old
woman
will
like
to
know
when
to
expect
you
 
<EOS>
you
know
such
people
think
more
about
have
their
cottage
in
order
when
decent
people
come
to
see
them
than
we
be
apt
to
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
be
a
wonderful
instance
of
consideration
from
the
thoughtless
Miss
Murray
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
name
an
hour
in
the
morning
at
which
he
would
endeavour
,
to
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
carriage
be
ready
,
and
the
footman
be
wait
,
with
an
open
umbrella
,
to
escort
Miss
Murray
through
the
churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
about
to
follow
;
but
Mr.
Weston
have
an
umbrella
too
,
and
offer
me
the
benefit
of
its
shelter
,
for
it
be
rain
heavily
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
thank
you
,
I
do
not
mind
the
rain
,
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
lack
common
sense
when
take
by
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
do
not
like
it
,
I
suppose
?
 
<EOS>
an
umbrella
will
do
you
no
harm
at
any
rate
,
"
he
reply
,
with
a
smile
that
show
he
be
not
offend
;
as
a
man
of
bad
temper
or
less
penetration
would
have
be
at
such
a
refusal
of
his
aid
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
deny
the
truth
of
his
assertion
,
and
so
go
with
him
to
the
carriage
;
he
even
offer
me
his
hand
on
get
in
:
 
an
unnecessary
piece
of
civility
,
but
I
accept
that
too
,
for
fear
of
give
offence
.
 
<EOS>
one
glance
he
give
,
one
little
smile
at
part
 
<EOS>
it
be
<EOS>
but
for
a
moment
;
but
therein
I
read
,
or
think
I
read
,
a
meaning
that
kindle
in
my
heart
a
bright
flame
of
hope
than
have
ever
yet
arise
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
send
the
footman
back
for
you
,
Miss
Grey
,
if
you
would
wait
a
moment
 
you
need
not
have
take
Mr.
Weston
's
umbrella
,
"
observe
Rosalie
,
with
a
very
unamiable
cloud
upon
her
pretty
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
come
without
an
umbrella
,
but
Mr.
Weston
offer
me
the
benefit
of
his
,
and
I
could
not
have
refuse
it
more
than
I
do
without
offend
him
,
"
reply
I
,
smile
placidly
;
for
my
inward
happiness
make
that
amusing
,
which
would
have
wound
me
at
another
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
carriage
be
now
in
motion
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Murray
bent
forwards
,
and
look
out
of
the
window
as
we
be
pass
Mr.
Weston
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
pace
homeward
along
the
causeway
,
and
do
not
turn
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
stupid
ass
!
"
<EOS>
cry
she
,
throw
herself
back
again
in
the
seat
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
what
you
have
lose
by
not

this
way

<EOS>
"
what
have
he
lose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
a
bow
from
me
,
that
would
have
raise
him
to
the
seventh
heaven
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
make
no
answer
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
she
be
out
of
humour
,
and
I
derive
a
secret
gratification
from
the
fact
,
not
that
she
be
vex
,
but
that
she
think
she
have
reason
to
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
It
make
me
think
my
hope
be
not
entirely
the
offspring
of
my
wish
and
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
take
up
Mr.
Weston
instead
of
Mr.
Hatfield
,
"
say
my
companion
,
after
a
short
pause
,
resume
something
of
her
usual
cheerfulness
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
ball
at
Ashby
Park
take
place
on
Tuesday
,
you
know
;
and
mamma
think
it
very
likely
that
Sir
Thomas
will
propose
to
me
then
:
 
<EOS>
such
thing
be
often
do
in
the
privacy
of
the
ball
-
room
,
when
gentleman
be
most
easily
ensnare
,
and
lady
most
enchanting
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
I
be
to
be
marry
so
soon
,
I
must
make
the
good
of
the
present
time
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
determine
Hatfield
shall
not
be
the
only
man
who
shall
lay
his
heart
at
my
foot
,
and
implore
me
to
accept
the
worthless
gift
in
vain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
mean
Mr.
Weston
to
be
one
of
your
victim
,
"
say
I
,
with
affected
indifference
,
"
you
will
have
to
make
such
overture
yourself
that
you
will
find
it
difficult
to
draw
back
when
he
ask
you
to
fulfil
the
expectation
you
have
raise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
suppose
he
will
ask
me
to
marry
him
,
nor
should
I
desire
it
:
 
that
would
be
rather
too
much
presumption
!
<EOS>
but
I
intend
him
to
feel
my
power
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
feel
it
already
,
indeed
:
 
but
he
shall
acknowledge
it
too
;
and
what
visionary
hope
he
may
have
,
he
must
keep
to
himself
,
and
only
amuse
me
with
the
result
of
them
 
for
a
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
that
some
kind
spirit
would
whisper
those
word
in
his
ear
,
"
I
inwardly
exclaim
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
far
too
indignant
to
hazard
a
reply
to
her
observation
aloud
;
and
nothing
more
be
say
about
Mr.
Weston
that
day
,
by
me
or
in
my
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
but
next
morning
,
soon
after
breakfast
,
Miss
Murray
come
into
the
schoolroom
,
where
her
sister
be
employ
at
her
study
,
or
rather
her
lesson
,
for
study
they
be
not
,
and
say
,
"
Matilda
,
I
want
you
to
take
a
walk
with
me
about
eleven
o'clock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
can
not
,
Rosalie
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
to
give
order
about
my
new
bridle
and
saddle
-
cloth
,
and
speak
to
the
rat
-
catcher
about
his
dog
:
Miss
Grey
must
go
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
want
you
,
"
say
Rosalie
;
and
call
her
sister
to
the
window
,
she
whisper
an
explanation
in
her
ear
;
upon
which
the
latter
consent
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
that
eleven
be
the
hour
at
which
Mr.
Weston
propose
to
come
to
the
porter
's
lodge
;
and
remember
that
,
I
beheld
the
whole
contrivance
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
at
dinner
,
I
be
entertain
with
a
long
account
of
how
Mr.
Weston
have
overtake
them
as
they
be
walk
along
the
road
;
and
how
they
have
have
a
long
walk
and
talk
with
him
,
and
really
find
him
quite
an
agreeable
companion
;
and
how
he
must
have
be
,
and
evidently
be
,
delighted
with
them
and
their
amazing
condescension

CONFESSIONS
  
<EOS>
as
I
be
in
the
way
of
confession
I
may
as
well
acknowledge
that
,
about
this
time
,
I
pay
more
attention
to
dress
than
ever
I
have
do
before
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
not
say
much
 
for
hitherto
<EOS>
I
have
be
a
little
neglectful
in
that
particular
;
but
now
,
also
,
it
be
no
uncommon
thing
to
spend
as
much
as
two
minute
in
the
contemplation
of
my
own
image
in
the
glass
;
though
I
never
could
derive
any
consolation
from
such
a
study
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
discover
no
beauty
in
those
mark
feature
,
that
pale
hollow
cheek
,
and
ordinary
dark
brown
hair
;
there
may
be
intellect
in
the
forehead
,
there
may
be
expression
in
the
dark
grey
eye
,
but
what
of
that
?
 
<EOS>
a
low
grecian
brow
,
and
large
black
eye
<EOS>
devoid
of
sentiment
would
be
esteem
far
preferable
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
foolish
to
wish
for
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
sensible
people
never
either
desire
it
for
themselves
or
care
about
it
in
other
.
<EOS>
if
the
mind
be
but
well
cultivated
,
and
the
heart
well
disposed
,
no
one
ever
care
for
the
exterior
.
 
<EOS>
so
say
the
teacher
of
our
childhood
;
and
so
say
we
to
the
child
of
the
present
day
.
 
<EOS>
all
very
judicious
and
proper
,
no
doubt
;
but
be
such
assertion
support
by
actual
experience
?
  
<EOS>
We
be
naturally
dispose
to
love
what
give
us
pleasure
,
and
what
more
pleasing
than
a
beautiful
face
 
when
we
know
no
harm
of
the
possessor
at
least
?
 
<EOS>
a
little
girl
love
her
bird
 
<EOS>
why
?
 
<EOS>
because
it
live
and
feel
;
because
it
be
helpless
and
harmless
?
 
<EOS>
a
toad
,
likewise
,
life
and
feel
,
and
be
equally
helpless
and
harmless
;
but
though
she
would
not
hurt
a
toad
,
she
can
not
love
it
like
the
bird
,
with
its
graceful
form
,
soft
feather
,
and
bright
,
speak
eye
.
 
<EOS>
if
a
woman
be
fair
and
amiable
,
she
be
praise
for
both
quality
,
but
especially
the
former
,
by
the
bulk
of
mankind
:
 
if
,
on
the
other
hand
,
she
be
disagreeable
in
person
and
character
,
her
plainness
be
commonly
inveigh
against
as
her
great
crime
,
because
,
to
common
observer
,
it
give
the
great
offence
;
while
,
if
she
be
plain
and
good
,
provide
she
be
a
person
of
retired
manner
and
seclude
life
,
no
one
ever
know
of
her
goodness
,
except
her
immediate
connection
.
 
<EOS>
Others
,
on
the
contrary
,
be
dispose
to
form
unfavourable
opinion
of
her
mind
,
and
disposition
,
if
it
be
but
to
excuse
themselves
for
their
instinctive
dislike
of
one
so
unfavoure
by
nature
;
and
visa
versa
with
her
<EOS>
whose
angel
form
conceal
a
vicious
heart
,
or
shed
a
false
,
deceitful
charm
over
defect
and
foible
that
would
not
be
tolerate
in
another
.
 
<EOS>
They
that
have
beauty
,
let
them
be
thankful
for
it
,
and
make
a
good
use
of
it
,
like
any
other
talent
;
they
that
have
it
not
,
let
them
console
themselves
,
and
do
the
good
they
can
without
it
:
 
certainly
,
though
liable
to
be
over
-
estimate
,
it
be
a
gift
of
God
,
and
not
to
be
despise
.
 
<EOS>
many
will
feel
this
who
have
feel
that
they
could
love
,
and
whose
heart
tell
them
that
they
be
worthy
to
be
love
again
;
while
yet
they
be
debar
,
by
the
lack
of
this
or
some
such
seeming
trifle
,
from
give
and
receive
that
happiness
they
seem
almost
make
to
feel
and
to
impart
.
 
<EOS>
as
well
may
the
humble
glowworm
despise
that
power
of
give
light
without
which
the
rove
fly
may
pass
her
and
repass
her
a
thousand
time
,
and
never
rest
beside
her
:
 
<EOS>
she
may
hear
her
wing
darling
buzzing
over
and
around
her
;
he
vainly
seek
her
,
she
long
to
be
find
,
but
with
no
power
to
make
her
presence
know
,
no
voice
to
call
him
,
no
wing
to
follow
his
flight
;
 
<EOS>
the
fly
must
seek
another
mate
,
the
worm
must
live
and
die
alone
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
some
of
my
reflection
about
this
period
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
go
on
prose
more
and
more
,
I
may
dive
much
deep
,
and
disclose
other
thought
,
propose
question
the
reader
may
be
puzzle
to
answer
,
and
deduce
argument
that
may
startle
his
prejudice
,
or
,
perhaps
,
provoke
his
ridicule
,
because
he
could
not
comprehend
them
;
but
I
forbear
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
therefore
,
let
us
return
to
Miss
Murray
.
 
<EOS>
She
accompany
her
mamma
to
the
ball
on
Tuesday
;
of
course
splendidly
attire
,
and
delighted
with
her
prospect
and
her
charm
.
 
<EOS>
as
Ashby
Park
be
nearly
ten
mile
distant
from
Horton
Lodge
,
they
have
to
set
out
pretty
early
,
and
I
intend
to
have
spend
the
evening
with
Nancy
Brown
,
whom
I
have
not
see
for
a
long
time
;
but
my
kind
pupil
take
care
<EOS>
I
should
spend
it
neither
there
nor
anywhere
else
beyond
the
limit
of
the
schoolroom
,
by
give
me
a
piece
of
music
to
copy
,
which
keep
me
closely
occupied
till
bed
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
about
eleven
next
morning
,
as
soon
as
she
have
leave
her
room
,
she
come
to
tell
me
her
news
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
have
indeed
propose
to
her
at
the
ball
;
an
event
which
reflect
great
credit
on
her
mamma
's
sagacity
,
if
not
upon
her
skill
in
contrivance
.
 
<EOS>
I
rather
incline
to
the
belief
that
she
have
first
lay
her
plan
,
and
then
predict
their
success
.
 
<EOS>
the
offer
have
be
accept
,
of
course
,
and
the
bridegroom
elect
be
come
that
day
to
settle
matter
with
Mr.
Murray
.
  
<EOS>
Rosalie
be
pleased
with
the
thought
of
become
mistress
of
Ashby
Park
;
she
be
elate
with
the
prospect
of
the
bridal
ceremony
and
its
attendant
splendour
and
eclat
,
the
honeymoon
spend
abroad
,
and
the
subsequent
gaiety
she
expect
to
enjoy
in
London
and
elsewhere
;
she
appear
pretty
well
pleased
too
,
for
the
time
be
,
with
Sir
Thomas
himself
,
because
she
have
so
lately
see
him
,
dance
with
him
,
and
be
flatter
by
him
;
but
,
after
all
,
she
seem
to
shrink
from
the
idea
of
be
so
soon
unite
:
 
<EOS>
she
wish
the
ceremony
to
be
delay
some
month
,
at
least
;
and
I
wish
it
too
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
a
horrible
thing
to
hurry
on
the
inauspicious
match
,
and
not
to
give
the
poor
creature
time
to
think
and
reason
on
the
irrevocable
step
<EOS>
she
be
about
to
take
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
no
pretension
to
"
a
mother
's
watchful
,
anxious
care
,
"
but
I
be
amazed
and
horrify
at
Mrs.
Murray
's
heartlessness
,
or
want
of
thought
for
the
real
good
of
her
child
;
and
by
my
unheeded
warning
and
exhortation
,
I
vainly
strove
to
remedy
the
evil
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Murray
only
laugh
at
what
I
say
;
and
I
soon
find
that
her
reluctance
to
an
immediate
union
arise
chiefly
from
a
desire
to
do
what
execution
she
could
among
the
young
gentleman
of
her
acquaintance
,
before
she
be
incapacitate
from
further
mischief
of
the
kind
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
for
this
cause
that
,
before
confide
to
me
the
secret
of
her
engagement
,
she
have
extract
a
promise
that
I
would
not
mention
a
word
on
the
subject
to
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
see
this
,
and
when
I
beheld
her
plunge
more
recklessly
than
ever
into
the
depth
of
heartless
coquetry
,
I
have
no
more
pity
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
what
will
,
"
I
think
,
"
she
deserve
it
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
can
not
be
too
bad
for
her
;
and
the
sooner
she
be
incapacitate
from
deceive
and
injure
other
the
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
wedding
be
fix
for
the
first
of
June
.
 
<EOS>
between
that
and
the
critical
ball
be
little
more
than
six
week
;
but
,
with
Rosalie
's
accomplished
skill
and
resolute
exertion
,
much
may
be
do
,
even
within
that
period
;
especially
as
Sir
Thomas
spend
most
of
the
interim
in
London
;
whither
he
go
up
,
it
be
say
,
to
settle
affair
with
his
lawyer
,
and
make
other
preparation
for
the
approach
nuptial
.
 
<EOS>
He
endeavour
to
supply
the
want
of
his
presence
by
a
pretty
constant
fire
of
billet
-
doux
;
but
these
do
not
attract
the
neighbour
'
attention
,
and
open
their
eye
,
as
personal
visit
would
have
do
;
and
old
Lady
Ashby
's
haughty
,
sour
spirit
of
reserve
withhold
her
from
spread
the
news
,
while
her
indifferent
health
prevent
her
come
to
visit
her
future
daughter
-
in
-
law
;
so
that
,
altogether
,
this
affair
be
keep
far
closer
than
such
thing
usually
be
.
  
<EOS>
Rosalie
would
sometimes
show
her
lover
's
epistle
to
me
,
to
convince
me
what
a
kind
,
devoted
husband
he
would
make
.
 
<EOS>
She
show
me
the
letter
of
another
individual
,
too
,
the
unfortunate
Mr.
Green
,
who
have
not
the
courage
,
or
,
as
she
express
it
,
the
"
spunk
,
"
to
plead
his
cause
in
person
,
but
whom
one
denial
would
not
satisfy
:
 
he
must
write
again
and
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
have
do
so
if
he
could
have
see
the
grimace
his
fair
idol
make
over
his
move
appeal
to
her
feeling
,
and
hear
her
scornful
laughter
,
and
the
opprobrious
epithet
she
heap
upon
him
for
his
perseverance
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
you
tell
him
,
at
once
,
that
you
be
engage
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
do
not
want
him
to
know
that
,
"
reply
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
he
know
it
,
his
sister
and
everybody
would
know
it
,
and
then
there
would
be
an
end
of
my
 
ahem
!
 
<EOS>
and
,
besides
,
if
I
tell
him
that
,
he
would
think
my
engagement
be
the
only
obstacle
,
and
that
I
would
have
him
if
I
be
free
;
which
I
could
not
bear
that
any
man
should
think
,
and
he
,
of
all
other
,
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
I
do
not
care
for
his
letter
,
"
she
add
,
contemptuously
;
"
he
may
write
as
often
as
he
please
,
and
look
as
great
a
calf
as
he
like
when
I
meet
him
;
it
only
amuse
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
meantime
,
young
Meltham
be
pretty
frequent
in
his
visit
to
the
house
or
transit
past
it
;
and
,
judge
by
Matilda
's
execration
and
reproach
,
her
sister
pay
more
attention
to
him
than
civility
require
;
in
other
word
,
she
carry
on
as
animate
a
flirtation
as
the
presence
of
her
parent
would
admit
.
 
<EOS>
She
make
some
attempt
to
bring
Mr.
Hatfield
once
more
to
her
foot
;
but
find
them
unsuccessful
,
she
repay
his
haughty
indifference
with
still
lofty
scorn
,
and
speak
of
him
with
as
much
disdain
and
detestation
as
she
have
formerly
do
of
his
curate
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
amid
all
this
,
she
never
for
a
moment
lose
sight
of
Mr.
Weston
.
 
<EOS>
She
embrace
every
opportunity
of
meet
him
,
try
every
art
to
fascinate
him
,
and
pursue
him
with
as
much
perseverance
as
if
she
really
love
him
and
no
other
,
and
the
happiness
of
her
life
depend
upon
elicit
a
return
of
affection
.
 
<EOS>
such
conduct
be
completely
beyond
my
comprehension
.
 
<EOS>
have
I
see
it
depict
in
a
novel
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
think
it
unnatural
;
have
I
hear
it
describe
by
other
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
deem
it
a
mistake
or
an
exaggeration
;
but
when
I
see
it
with
my
own
eye
,
and
suffer
from
it
too
,
I
could
only
conclude
that
excessive
vanity
,
like
drunkenness
,
harden
the
heart
,
enslave
the
faculty
,
and
pervert
the
feeling
;
and
that
dog
be
not
the
only
creature
which
,
when
gorge
to
the
throat
,
will
yet
gloat
over
what
they
can
not
devour
,
and
grudge
the
small
morsel
to
a
starve
brother
.
  
<EOS>
She
now
become
extremely
beneficent
to
the
poor
cottager
.
 
<EOS>
Her
acquaintance
among
them
be
more
widely
extended
,
her
visit
to
their
humble
dwelling
be
more
frequent
and
excursive
than
they
have
ever
be
before
.
 
<EOS>
Hereby
,
she
earn
among
them
the
reputation
of
a
condescending
and
very
charitable
young
lady
;
and
their
encomium
be
sure
to
be
repeat
to
Mr.
Weston
:
 
<EOS>
whom
also
she
have
thus
a
daily
chance
of
meet
in
one
or
other
of
their
abode
,
or
in
her
transit
to
and
fro
;
and
often
,
likewise
,
she
could
gather
,
through
their
gossip
,
to
what
place
<EOS>
he
be
likely
to
go
at
such
and
such
a
time
,
whether
to
baptize
a
child
,
or
to
visit
the
age
,
the
sick
,
the
sad
,
or
the
dying
;
and
most
skilfully
she
lay
her
plan
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
in
these
excursion
she
would
sometimes
go
with
her
sister
 
<EOS>
whom
,
by
some
mean
,
she
have
persuade
or
bribe
to
enter
into
her
scheme
 
sometimes
alone
,
never
,
now
,
with
me
;
so
that
I
be
debar
the
pleasure
of
see
Mr.
Weston
,
or
hear
his
voice
even
in
conversation
with
another
:
 
which
would
certainly
have
be
a
very
great
pleasure
,
however
hurtful
or
however
fraught
with
pain
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
even
see
him
at
church
:
 
for
Miss
Murray
,
under
some
trivial
pretext
,
choose
to
take
possession
of
that
corner
in
the
family
pew
which
have
be
mine
ever
since
I
come
;
and
,
unless
I
have
the
presumption
to
station
myself
between
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Murray
,
I
must
sit
with
my
back
to
the
pulpit
,
which
I
accordingly
do
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
also
,
I
never
walk
home
with
my
pupil
:
 
<EOS>
they
say
their
mamma
think
it
do
not
look
well
to
see
three
people
out
of
the
family
walk
,
and
only
two
go
in
the
carriage
;
and
,
as
they
greatly
prefer
walk
in
fine
weather
,
I
should
be
honour
by
go
with
the
senior
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
besides
,
"
say
they
,
"
you
can
not
walk
as
fast
as
we
do
;
you
know
you
be
always
lag
behind
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
know
these
be
false
excuse
,
but
I
make
no
objection
,
and
never
contradict
such
assertion
,
well
know
the
motive
which
dictate
them
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
the
afternoon
,
during
those
six
memorable
week
,
I
never
go
to
church
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
a
cold
,
or
any
slight
indisposition
,
they
take
advantage
of
that
to
make
me
stay
at
home
;
and
often
they
would
tell
me
they
be
not
go
again
that
day
,
themselves
,
and
then
pretend
to
change
their
mind
,
and
set
off
without
tell
me
:
 
so
manage
their
departure
that
I
never
discover
the
change
of
purpose
till
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
upon
their
return
home
,
on
one
of
these
occasion
,
they
entertain
me
with
an
animate
account
of
a
conversation
they
have
have
with
Mr.
Weston
as
they
come
along
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
he
ask
if
you
be
ill
,
Miss
Grey
,
"
say
Matilda
;
"
but
we
tell
him
you
be
quite
well
,
only
you
do
not
want
to
come
to
church
 
<EOS>
so
he
will
think
you
be
turn
wicked
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
all
chance
meeting
on
week
-
day
be
likewise
carefully
prevent
;
for
,
lest
I
should
go
to
see
poor
Nancy
Brown
or
any
other
person
,
Miss
Murray
take
good
care
to
provide
sufficient
employment
for
all
my
leisure
hour
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
always
some
drawing
to
finish
,
some
music
to
copy
,
or
some
work
to
do
,
sufficient
to
incapacitate
me
from
indulge
in
anything
beyond
a
short
walk
about
the
ground
,
however
she
or
her
sister
may
be
occupy
.
  
<EOS>
one
morning
,
have
seek
and
waylay
Mr.
Weston
,
they
return
in
high
glee
to
give
me
an
account
of
their
interview
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
he
ask
after
you
again
,
"
say
Matilda
,
in
spite
of
her
sister
's
silent
but
imperative
intimation
that
she
should
hold
her
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
wonder
why
you
be
never
with
us
,
and
think
you
must
have
delicate
health
,
as
you
come
out
so
seldom
.

<EOS>
"
He
do
not
Matilda

what
nonsense
you
be
talk
!
<EOS>

<EOS>

oh
,
Rosalie

what
a
lie

He

it

<EOS>
I
will
not
be
pinch
so
!
 
<EOS>
and
,
Miss
Grey
,
Rosalie
tell
him
you
be
quite
well
,
but
you
be
always
so
bury
in
your
book
that
you
have
no
pleasure
in
anything
else

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
an
idea
he
must
have
of
me
!
"
<EOS>
I
think
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
,
"
I
ask
,
"
do
old
Nancy
ever
inquire
about
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
and
we
tell
her
you
be
so
fond
of
read
and
draw
that
you
can
do
nothing
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
not
the
case
though
;
if
you
have
tell
her
I
be
so
busy
<EOS>
I
could
not
come
to
see
her
,
it
would
have
be
nearer
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
it
would
,
"
reply
Miss
Murray
,
suddenly
kindle
up
;
"
I
be
sure
you
have
plenty
of
time
to
yourself
now
,
when
you
have
so
little
teaching
to
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
no
use
begin
to
dispute
with
such
indulged
,
unreasone
creature
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
hold
my
peace
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
accustomed
,
now
,
to
keep
silence
when
thing
distasteful
to
my
ear
be
utter
;
and
now
,
too
,
I
be
use
to
wear
a
placid
smile
countenance
when
my
heart
be
bitter
within
me
.
 
<EOS>
only
those
who
have
feel
the
like
can
imagine
my
feeling
,
as
I
sit
with
an
assumption
of
smile
indifference
,
listen
to
the
account
of
those
meeting
and
interview
with
Mr.
Weston
,
which
they
seem
to
find
such
pleasure
in
describe
to
me
;
and
hear
thing
assert
of
him
which
,
from
the
character
of
the
man
,
I
know
to
be
exaggeration
and
perversion
of
the
truth
,
if
not
entirely
false
 
thing
derogatory
to
him
,
and
flattering
to
them
 
especially
to
Miss
Murray
 
which
I
burn
to
contradict
,
or
,
at
least
,
to
show
my
doubt
about
,
but
dare
not
;
l
,
in
express
my
disbelief
,
I
should
display
my
interest
too
.
 
<EOS>
other
thing
I
hear
,
which
I
feel
or
fear
be
indeed
too
true
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
still
conceal
my
anxiety
respect
him
,
my
indignation
against
them
,
beneath
a
careless
aspect
;
other
,
again
,
mere
hint
of
something
say
or
do
,
which
I
long
to
hear
more
of
,
but
could
not
venture
to
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
so
pass
the
weary
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
even
comfort
myself
with
say
,
"
She
will
soon
be
marry
;
and
then
there
may
be
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
soon
after
her
marriage
the
holiday
would
come
;
and
when
I
return
from
home
,
most
likely
,
Mr.
Weston
would
be
go
,
for
I
be
tell
that
he
and
the
rector
could
not
agree
(
the
rector
's
fault
,
of
course
)
,
and
he
be
about
to
remove
to
another
place
.
  
<EOS>
no
 
besides
my
hope
in
God
,
my
only
consolation
be
in
thinking
that
,
though
he
know
it
not
,
I
be
more
worthy
of
his
love
than
Rosalie
Murray
,
charming
and
engaging
as
she
be
;
for
I
could
appreciate
his
excellence
,
which
she
could
not
:
 
I
would
devote
my
life
to
the
promotion
of
his
happiness
;
she
would
destroy
his
happiness
for
the
momentary
gratification
of
her
own
vanity
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
if
he
could
but
know
the
difference
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
would
earnestly
exclaim
.
"
<EOS>
but
no
!
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
him
see
my
heart
:
 
yet
,
if
he
could
but
know
her
hollowness
,
her
worthless
,
heartless
frivolity
,
he
would
then
be
safe
,
and
I
should
be
 
almost
happy
,
though
I
may
never
see
him
more
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
fear
,
by
this
time
,
the
reader
be
well
nigh
disgust
with
the
folly
and
weakness
I
have
so
freely
lay
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
disclose
it
then
,
and
would
not
have
do
<EOS>
so
have
my
own
sister
or
my
mother
be
with
me
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
close
and
resolute
dissembler
 
in
this
one
case
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
My
prayer
,
my
tear
,
my
wish
,
fear
,
and
lamentation
,
be
witness
by
myself
and
heaven
alone
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
be
harass
by
sorrow
or
anxiety
,
or
long
oppress
by
any
powerful
feeling
which
we
must
keep
to
ourselves
,
for
which
we
can
obtain
and
seek
no
sympathy
from
any
live
creature
,
and
<EOS>
which
yet
we
can
not
,
or
will
not
wholly
crush
,
we
often
naturally
seek
relief
in
poetry
 
and
often
find
it
,
too
 
whether
in
the
effusion
of
other
,
which
seem
to
harmonize
with
our
exist
case
,
or
in
our
own
attempt
to
give
utterance
to
those
thought
and
feeling
in
strain
less
musical
,
perchance
,
but
more
appropriate
,
and
therefore
more
penetrating
and
sympathetic
,
and
,
for
the
time
,
more
soothing
,
or
more
powerful
to
rouse
and
to
unburden
the
oppressed
and
swollen
heart
.
 
<EOS>
before
this
time
,
at
Wellwood
House
and
here
,
when
suffer
from
home
-
sick
melancholy
,
I
have
seek
relief
twice
or
thrice
at
this
secret
source
of
consolation
;
and
now
I
fly
to
it
again
,
with
great
avidity
than
ever
,
because
I
seem
to
need
it
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
still
preserve
those
relic
of
past
suffering
and
experience
,
like
pillar
of
witness
set
up
in
travel
through
the
vale
of
life
,
to
mark
particular
occurrence
.
 
<EOS>
the
footstep
be
obliterate
now
;
the
face
of
the
country
may
be
change
;
but
the
pillar
be
still
there
,
to
remind
me
how
all
thing
be
when
it
be
rear
.
 
<EOS>
lest
the
reader
should
be
curious
to
see
any
of
these
effusion
,
I
will
favour
him
with
one
short
speciman
:
 
cold
and
languid
as
the
line
may
seem
,
it
be
almost
a
passion
of
grief
to
which
they
owe
their
being
:
    
<EOS>
oh
,
they
have
rob
me
of
the
hope
My
spirit
hold
so
dear
;
They
will
not
let
me
hear
that
voice
My
soul
delight
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
They
will
not
let
me
see
that
face
<EOS>
I
so
delight
to
see
;
and
they
have
take
all
thy
smile
,
and
all
thy
love
from
me
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
let
them
seize
on
all
they
can
;
   
one
treasure
still
be
mine
,
   
a
heart
that
love
to
think
on
thee
,
and
feel
the
worth
of
thine
.
  
<EOS>
yes
,
at
least
,
they
could
not
deprive
me
of
that
:
 
I
could
think
of
him
day
and
night
;
and
I
could
feel
that
he
be
worthy
to
be
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
know
him
as
I
do
;
nobody
could
appreciate
him
as
I
do
;
nobody
could
love
him
as
I
 
could
,
if
I
may
:
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
the
evil
.
 
<EOS>
what
business
have
I
to
think
so
much
of
one
that
never
think
of
me
?
 
<EOS>
be
it
not
foolish
?
<EOS>
be
it
not
wrong
?
 
<EOS>
yet
,
if
I
find
such
deep
delight
in
thinking
of
him
,
and
if
I
keep
those
thought
to
myself
,
and
trouble
no
one
else
with
them
,
where
be
the
harm
of
it
?
<EOS>
I
would
ask
myself
.
 
<EOS>
and
such
reasoning
prevent
me
from
make
any
sufficient
effort
to
shake
off
my
fetter
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
if
those
thought
bring
delight
,
it
be
a
painful
,
troubled
pleasure
,
too
near
akin
to
anguish
;
and
one
that
do
me
more
injury
than
I
be
aware
of
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
indulgence
that
a
person
of
more
wisdom
or
more
experience
would
doubtless
have
deny
herself
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
how
dreary
to
turn
my
eye
from
the
contemplation
of
that
bright
object
and
force
them
to
dwell
on
the
dull
,
grey
,
desolate
prospect
around
:
 
<EOS>
the
joyless
,
hopeless
,
solitary
path
that
lie
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
wrong
to
be
so
joyless
,
<EOS>
so
desponding
;
I
should
have
make
God
my
friend
,
and
to
do
His
will
<EOS>
the
pleasure
and
the
business
of
my
life
;
but
faith
be
weak
,
and
passion
be
too
strong
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
time
of
trouble
I
have
two
other
cause
of
affliction
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
may
seem
a
trifle
,
but
it
cost
me
many
a
tear
:
 
<EOS>
Snap
,
my
little
dumb
,
rough
-
visaged
,
but
bright
-
eyed
,
warm
-
hearted
companion
,
the
only
thing
I
have
to
love
me
,
be
take
away
,
and
deliver
over
to
the
tender
mercy
of
the
village
rat
-
catcher
,
a
man
notorious
for
his
brutal
treatment
of
his
canine
slave
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
be
serious
enough
;
my
letter
from
home
give
intimation
that
my
father
's
health
be
bad
.
 
<EOS>
no
boding
fear
be
express
,
but
I
be
grow
timid
and
despondent
,
and
could
not
help
fear
that
some
dreadful
calamity
await
us
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
seem
to
see
the
black
cloud
gather
round
my
native
hill
,
and
to
hear
the
angry
muttering
of
a
storm
that
be
about
to
burst
,
and
desolate
our
hearth
.
    
<EOS>
MIRTH
and
MOURNING
  
<EOS>
the
1st
of
June
arrive
at
last
:
 
and
Rosalie
Murray
be
transmute
into
Lady
Ashby
.
 
<EOS>
most
splendidly
beautiful
she
look
in
her
bridal
costume
.
 
<EOS>
upon
her
return
from
church
,
after
the
ceremony
,
she
come
fly
into
the
schoolroom
,
flush
with
excitement
,
and
laughing
,
half
in
mirth
,
and
half
in
reckless
desperation
,
as
it
seem
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
Miss
Grey
,
I
be
Lady
Ashby
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
do
,
my
fate
be
seal
:
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
drawing
back
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
come
to
receive
your
congratulation
and
bid
you
good
-
by
;
and
then
I
be
off
for
Paris
,
Rome
,
Naples
,
Switzerland
,
London
 
<EOS>
oh
,
dear
!
<EOS>
what
a
deal
I
shall
see
and
hear
before
I
come
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
but
do
not
forget
me
:
<EOS>
I
shall
not
forget
you
,
though
I
have
be
a
naughty
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
why
do
not
you
congratulate
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
congratulate
you
,
"
I
reply
,
"
till
I
know
whether
this
change
be
really
for
the
well
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
sincerely
hope
it
be
;
and
I
wish
you
true
happiness
and
the
good
of
blessing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
good
-
by
,
the
carriage
be
wait
,
and
they
be
call
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
give
me
a
hasty
kiss
,
and
be
hurry
away
;
but
,
suddenly
return
,
embrace
me
with
more
affection
than
I
think
her
capable
of
evincing
,
and
depart
with
tear
in
her
eye
.
 
<EOS>
poor
girl
!
 
<EOS>
I
really
love
her
then
;
and
forgave
her
from
my
heart
all
the
injury
she
have
do
me
 
and
other
also
:
 
<EOS>
she
have
not
half
know
it
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
;
and
I
pray
God
to
pardon
her
too
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
remainder
of
that
day
of
festal
sadness
,
I
be
leave
to
my
own
device
.
 
<EOS>
be
too
much
unhinged
for
any
steady
occupation
,
I
wander
about
with
a
book
in
my
hand
for
several
hour
,
more
thinking
than
read
,
for
I
have
many
thing
to
think
about
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
evening
,
I
make
use
of
my
liberty
to
go
and
see
my
old
friend
Nancy
once
again
;
to
apologize
for
my
long
absence
(
which
must
have
seem
so
neglectful
and
unkind
)
by
tell
her
how
busy
I
have
be
;
and
to
talk
,
or
read
,
or
work
for
her
,
whichever
may
be
most
acceptable
,
and
also
,
of
course
,
to
tell
her
the
news
of
this
important
day
:
 
and
perhaps
to
obtain
a
little
information
from
her
in
return
,
respect
Mr.
Weston
's
expect
departure
.
 
<EOS>
but
of
this
she
seem
to
know
nothing
,
and
I
hope
,
as
she
do
,
that
it
be
all
a
false
report
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
very
glad
to
see
me
;
but
,
happily
,
her
eye
be
now
so
nearly
well
that
she
be
almost
independent
of
my
service
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
deeply
interested
in
the
wedding
;
but
while
I
amuse
her
with
the
detail
of
the
festive
day
,
the
splendours
of
the
bridal
party
and
of
the
bride
herself
,
she
often
sigh
and
shake
her
head
,
and
wish
good
may
come
of
it
<EOS>
;
she
seem
,
like
me
,
to
regard
it
rather
as
a
theme
for
sorrow
than
rejoice
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
a
long
time
talk
to
her
about
that
and
other
thing
 
but
no
one
come
.
  
<EOS>
Shall
I
confess
that
I
sometimes
look
towards
the
door
with
a
half
-
expectant
wish
to
see
it
open
and
give
entrance
to
Mr.
Weston
,
as
have
happen
once
before
?
<EOS>
and
that
,
return
through
the
lane
and
field
,
I
often
pause
to
look
round
me
,
and
walk
more
slowly
than
be
at
all
necessary
 
for
,
though
a
fine
evening
,
it
be
not
a
hot
one
 
and
,
finally
,
feel
a
sense
of
emptiness
and
disappointment
at
have
reach
the
house
without
meeting
or
even
catch
a
distant
glimpse
of
any
one
,
except
a
few
labourer
return
from
their
work
?
  
<EOS>
Sunday
,
however
,
be
approach
:
 
<EOS>
I
should
see
him
then
:
 
for
now
that
Miss
Murray
be
go
<EOS>
,
I
could
have
my
old
corner
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
see
him
,
and
by
look
,
speech
,
and
manner
,
I
may
judge
whether
the
circumstance
of
her
marriage
have
very
much
afflict
him
.
 
<EOS>
happily
I
could
perceive
no
shadow
of
a
difference
:
 
<EOS>
he
wear
the
same
aspect
as
he
have
wear
two
month
ago
 
voice
,
look
,
manner
,
all
alike
unchanged
:
 
there
be
the
same
keen
-
sighted
,
unclouded
truthfulness
in
his
discourse
,
the
same
forcible
clearness
in
his
style
,
the
same
earnest
simplicity
in
all
he
say
and
do
,
that
make
itself
,
not
mark
by
the
eye
and
ear
,
but
feel
upon
the
heart
of
his
audience
.
  
<EOS>
I
walk
home
with
Miss
Matilda
;
but
he
do
not
join
us
.
 
<EOS>
Matilda
be
now
sadly
at
a
loss
for
amusement
,
and
wofully
in
want
of
a
companion
:
 
<EOS>
her
brother
at
school
,
her
sister
marry
and
go
,
she
too
young
to
be
admit
into
society
;
for
which
,
from
Rosalie
's
example
,
she
be
in
some
degree
begin
to
acquire
a
taste
 
a
taste
at
least
for
the
company
of
certain
class
of
gentleman
;
at
this
dull
time
of
year
 
no
hunting
go
on
,
no
shooting
even
 
for
,
though
she
may
not
join
in
that
,
it
be
something
to
see
her
father
or
the
gamekeeper
go
out
with
the
dog
,
and
to
talk
with
them
on
their
return
,
about
the
different
bird
they
have
bag
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
also
,
she
be
deny
the
solace
which
the
companionship
of
the
coachman
,
groom
,
horse
,
greyhound
,
and
pointer
may
have
afford
;
for
her
mother
have
,
notwithstanding
the
disadvantage
of
a
country
life
,
so
satisfactorily
disposed
of
her
elder
daughter
,
the
pride
of
her
heart
have
begin
seriously
to
turn
her
attention
to
the
young
;
and
,
be
truly
alarm
at
the
roughness
of
her
manner
,
and
think
it
high
time
to
work
a
reform
,
have
be
rouse
at
length
to
exert
her
authority
,
and
prohibit
entirely
the
yard
,
stable
,
kennel
,
and
coach
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
,
she
be
not
implicitly
obey
;
but
,
indulgent
as
she
have
hitherto
be
,
when
once
her
spirit
be
rouse
,
her
temper
be
not
so
gentle
as
she
require
that
of
her
governess
to
be
,
and
her
will
be
not
to
be
thwart
with
impunity
.
 
<EOS>
after
many
a
scene
of
contention
between
mother
and
daughter
,
many
a
violent
outbreak
which
I
be
ashamed
to
witness
,
in
which
the
father
's
authority
be
often
call
in
to
confirm
with
oath
and
threat
the
mother
's
slight
prohibition
 
for
even
he
could
see
that
"
tilly
,
though
she
would
have
make
a
fine
lad
,
be
not
quite
what
a
young
lady
ought
to
be
"
 
<EOS>
Matilda
at
length
find
that
her
easy
plan
be
to
keep
clear
of
the
forbid
region
;
unless
she
could
now
and
then
steal
a
visit
without
her
watchful
mother
's
knowledge
.
  
<EOS>
amid
all
this
,
let
it
not
be
imagine
that
I
escape
without
many
a
reprimand
,
and
many
an
implied
reproach
,
that
lose
none
of
its
ste
from
not
be
openly
word
;
but
rather
wound
the
more
deeply
,
because
,
from
that
very
reason
,
it
seem
to
preclude
self
-
defence
.
<EOS>
frequently
,
I
be
tell
to
amuse
Miss
Matilda
with
other
thing
,
and
to
remind
her
of
her
mother
's
precept
and
prohibition
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
so
to
the
good
of
my
power
:
 
<EOS>
but
she
would
not
be
amuse
against
her
will
,
and
could
not
against
her
taste
;
and
though
I
go
beyond
mere
remind
,
such
gentle
remonstrance
as
I
could
use
be
utterly
ineffectual
.
  
<EOS>
"
DEAR
Miss
Grey
!
<EOS>
it
be
the
strange
thing
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
can
not
help
it
,
if
it
be
not
in
your
nature
 
<EOS>
but
I
wonder
you
can
not
win
the
confidence
of
that
girl
,
and
make
your
society
at
least
as
agreeable
to
her
as
that
of
Robert
or
Joseph
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
can
talk
the
good
about
the
thing
in
which
she
be
most
interested
,
"
I
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
!
that
be
a
strange
confession
,
however
,
to
come
from
her
GOVERNESS
!
 
<EOS>
who
be
to
form
a
young
lady
's
taste
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
,
if
the
governess
do
not
do
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
know
governess
who
have
so
completely
identify
themselves
with
the
reputation
of
their
young
lady
for
elegance
and
propriety
in
mind
and
manner
,
that
they
would
blush
to
speak
a
word
against
them
;
and
to
hear
the
slight
blame
impute
to
their
pupil
be
bad
than
to
be
censure
in
their
own
person
 
<EOS>
and
I
really
think
it
very
natural
,
for
my
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
you
,
madam
?
"
  
"
yes
,
of
course
:
 
the
young
lady
's
proficiency
and
elegance
be
of
more
consequence
to
the
governess
than
her
own
,
as
well
as
to
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
wish
to
prosper
in
her
vocation
she
must
devote
all
her
energy
to
her
business
:
 
all
her
idea
and
all
her
ambition
will
tend
to
the
accomplishment
of
that
one
object
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
wish
to
decide
upon
the
merit
of
a
governess
,
we
naturally
look
at
the
young
lady
she
profess
to
have
educate
,
and
judge
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
the
JUDICIOUS
governess
know
this
:
 
<EOS>
she
know
that
,
while
she
live
in
obscurity
herself
,
her
pupil
"
virtue
and
defect
will
be
open
to
every
eye
;
and
that
,
unless
she
lose
sight
of
herself
in
their
cultivation
,
she
nee
not
hope
for
success
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
Miss
Grey
,
it
be
just
the
same
as
any
other
trade
or
profession
:
 
they
that
wish
to
prosper
must
devote
themselves
body
and
soul
to
their
calling
;
and
if
they
begin
to
yield
to
indolence
or
self
-
indulgence
<EOS>
they
be
speedily
distance
by
wise
competitor
:
 
<EOS>
there
be
little
to
choose
between
a
person
that
ruin
her
pupil
by
neglect
,
and
one
that
corrupt
them
by
her
example
.
<EOS>
You
will
excuse
my
drop
these
little
hint
:
 
you
know
it
be
all
for
your
own
good
.
 
<EOS>
many
lady
would
speak
to
you
much
more
strongly
;
and
many
would
not
trouble
themselves
to
speak
at
all
,
but
quietly
look
out
for
a
substitute
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
of
course
,
would
be
the
EASIEST
plan
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
know
the
advantage
of
a
place
like
this
to
a
person
in
your
situation
;
and
I
have
no
desire
to
part
with
you
,
as
I
be
sure
you
would
do
very
well
<EOS>
if
you
will
only
think
of
these
thing
and
try
to
exert
yourself
a
little
more
:
 
<EOS>
then
,
I
be
convinced
,
you
would
soon
acquire
that
delicate
tact
which
alone
be
want
to
give
you
a
proper
influence
over
the
mind
of
your
pupil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
about
to
give
the
lady
some
idea
of
the
fallacy
of
her
expectation
;
but
she
sail
away
as
soon
as
she
have
conclude
her
speech
.
 
<EOS>
have
say
what
she
wish
,
it
be
no
part
of
her
plan
to
await
my
answer
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
my
business
to
hear
,
and
not
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
as
I
have
say
,
Matilda
at
length
yield
in
some
degree
to
her
mother
's
authority
(
pity
it
have
not
be
exert
before
)
;
and
be
thus
deprive
of
almost
every
source
of
amusement
,
there
be
nothing
for
it
but
to
take
long
ride
with
the
groom
and
long
walk
with
the
governess
,
and
to
visit
the
cottage
and
farmhouse
on
her
father
's
estate
,
to
kill
time
in
chat
with
the
old
man
and
woman
that
inhabit
them
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
of
these
walk
,
it
be
our
chance
to
meet
Mr.
Weston
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
what
I
have
long
desire
;
but
now
,
for
a
moment
,
I
wish
either
he
or
I
be
away
:
 
<EOS>
I
feel
my
heart
throb
so
violently
that
I
dread
lest
some
outward
sign
of
emotion
should
appear
;
but
I
think
he
hardly
glance
at
me
,
and
I
be
soon
calm
enough
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
brief
salutation
to
both
,
he
ask
Matilda
if
she
have
lately
hear
from
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
reply
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
at
Paris
when
she
write
,
and
very
well
,
and
very
happy
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
speak
the
last
word
emphatically
,
and
with
a
glance
impertinently
sly
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
seem
to
notice
it
,
but
reply
,
with
equal
emphasis
,
and
very
seriously
     
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
will
continue
to
be
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
think
it
likely
?
<EOS>
"
I
venture
to
inquire
:
 
for
Matilda
have
start
off
in
pursuit
of
her
dog
,
that
be
chase
a
leveret
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
,
"
reply
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Thomas
may
be
a
well
man
than
I
suppose
;
but
,
from
all
I
have
hear
and
see
,
it
seem
a
pity
that
one
so
young
and
gay
,
and
 
and
interesting
,
to
express
many
thing
by
one
word
 
whose
great
,
if
not
her
only
fault
,
appear
to
be
thoughtlessness
 
<EOS>
no
trifling
fault
to
be
sure
,
since
it
render
the
possessor
liable
to
almost
every
other
,
and
expose
him
to
so
many
temptation
 
<EOS>
but
it
seem
a
pity
that
she
should
be
throw
away
on
such
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
her
mother
's
wish
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
and
her
own
too
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
for
she
always
laugh
at
my
attempt
to
dissuade
her
from
the
step
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
attempt
it
?
 
<EOS>
then
,
at
least
,
you
will
have
the
satisfaction
of
know
that
it
be
no
fault
of
yours
,
if
any
harm
should
come
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
Mrs.
Murray
,
I
do
not
know
how
she
can
justify
her
conduct
:
 
if
I
have
sufficient
acquaintance
with
her
,
I
would
ask
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seem
unnatural
:
 
but
some
people
think
rank
and
wealth
the
chief
good
;
and
,
if
they
can
secure
that
for
their
child
,
they
think
they
have
do
their
duty
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
true
:
 
but
be
it
not
strange
that
person
of
experience
,
who
have
be
marry
themselves
,
should
judge
so
falsely
?
"
 
<EOS>
Matilda
now
come
pant
back
,
with
the
lacerated
body
of
the
young
hare
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
your
intention
to
kill
that
hare
,
or
to
save
it
,
Miss
Murray
?
"
ask
Mr.
Weston
,
apparently
puzzle
at
her
gleeful
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
pretend
to
want
to
save
it
,
"
she
answer
,
honestly
enough
,
"
as
it
be
so
glaringly
out
of
season
;
but
I
be
better
pleased
to
see
it
loll
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
you
can
both
witness
that
I
could
not
help
it
:
 
<EOS>
Prince
be
determine
to
have
her
;
and
he
clutch
her
by
the
back
,
and
kill
her
in
a
minute
!
 
<EOS>
be
not
it
a
noble
chase
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
!
for
a
young
lady
after
a
leveret
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
quiet
sarcasm
in
the
tone
of
his
reply
which
be
not
lose
upon
her
;
she
shrug
her
shoulder
,
and
,
turn
away
with
a
significant
"
Humph
!
"
<EOS>
ask
me
how
I
have
enjoy
the
fun
.
 
<EOS>
I
reply
that
I
see
no
fun
in
the
matter
;
but
admit
that
I
have
not
observe
the
transaction
very
narrowly
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
see
how
it
double
 
just
like
an
old
hare
?
<EOS>
and
do
not
you
hear
it
scream
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
happy
to
say
I
do
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
cry
out
just
like
a
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
poor
little
thing
!
 
<EOS>
what
will
you
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
come
along
 
I
shall
leave
it
in
the
first
house
we
come
to
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
to
take
it
home
,
for
fear
papa
<EOS>
should
scold
me
for
let
the
dog
kill
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
be
now
go
,
and
we
too
go
on
our
way
;
but
as
we
return
,
after
have
deposit
the
hare
in
a
farm
-
house
,
and
demolish
some
spice
-
cake
and
currant
-
wine
in
exchange
,
we
meet
him
return
also
from
the
execution
of
his
mission
,
whatever
it
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
carry
in
his
hand
a
cluster
of
beautiful
bluebell
,
which
he
offer
to
me
;
observe
,
with
a
smile
,
that
though
he
have
see
so
little
of
me
for
the
last
two
month
,
he
have
not
forget
that
bluebell
be
number
among
my
favourite
flower
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
do
as
a
simple
act
of
goodwill
,
without
compliment
or
remarkable
courtesy
,
or
any
look
that
could
be
construe
into
"
reverential
,
tender
adoration
"
(
vide
Rosalie
Murray
)
;
but
still
,
it
be
something
to
find
my
unimportant
say
so
well
remember
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
something
that
he
have
notice
so
accurately
the
time
I
have
cease
to
be
visible
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
tell
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
you
be
a
perfect
bookworm
,
Miss
Grey

so
completely
absorb
in
your
study
that
you
be
lose
to
every
other
pleasure

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
and
it
be
quite
true
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Matilda
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Mr.
Weston
:
 
<EOS>
do
not
believe
it
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
scandalous
libel
.
<EOS>
these
young
lady
be
too
fond
of
make
random
assertion
at
the
expense
of
their
friend
;
and
you
ought
to
be
careful
how
you
listen
to
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
this
assertion
be
groundless
,
at
any
rate

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
particularly
object
to
lady
study
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
but
I
object
to
anyone
so
devote
himself
or
herself
to
study
,
as
to
lose
sight
of
everything
else
.
 
<EOS>
except
under
peculiar
circumstance
,
I
consider
very
close
and
constant
study
as
a
waste
of
time
,
and
an
injury
to
the
mind
as
well
as
the
body
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
have
neither
the
time
nor
the
inclination
for
such
transgression
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
part
again
.
  
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
what
be
there
remarkable
in
all
this
?
 
<EOS>
why
have
I
record
it
?
 
<EOS>
because
,
reader
,
it
be
important
enough
to
give
me
a
cheerful
evening
,
a
night
of
pleasing
dream
,
and
a
morning
of
felicitous
hope
.
 
<EOS>
Shallow
-
brain
cheerfulness
,
foolish
dream
,
unfounded
hope
,
you
would
say
;
and
I
will
not
venture
to
deny
it
:
suspicion
to
that
effect
arise
too
frequently
in
my
own
mind
.
 
<EOS>
but
our
wish
be
like
tinder
:
 
the
flint
and
steel
of
circumstance
be
continually
strike
out
spark
,
which
vanish
immediately
,
unless
they
chance
to
fall
upon
the
tinder
of
our
wish
;
then
,
they
instantly
ignite
,
and
the
flame
of
hope
be
kindle
in
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
that
very
morning
,
my
flickering
flame
of
hope
be
dismally
quench
by
a
letter
from
my
mother
,
which
speak
so
seriously
of
my
father
's
increase
illness
,
that
I
fear
there
be
little
or
no
chance
of
his
recovery
;
and
,
close
at
hand
as
the
holiday
be
<EOS>
,
I
almost
tremble
lest
they
should
come
too
late
for
me
to
meet
him
in
this
world
.
 
<EOS>
two
day
after
,
a
letter
from
Mary
tell
me
his
life
be
despair
of
,
and
his
end
seem
fast
approach
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
immediately
,
I
seek
permission
to
anticipate
the
vacation
,
and
go
without
delay
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Murray
stare
,
and
wonder
at
the
unwonted
energy
and
boldness
with
which
I
urge
the
request
,
and
think
there
be
no
occasion
to
hurry
;
but
finally
give
me
leave
:
 
<EOS>
state
,
however
,
that
there
be
"
no
need
to
be
in
such
agitation
about
the
matter
 
<EOS>
it
may
prove
a
false
alarm
after
all
;
and
if
not
 
why
,
it
be
only
in
the
common
course
of
nature
:
we
must
all
die
some
time
;
and
I
be
not
to
suppose
myself
the
only
afflict
person
in
the
world
;
"
and
conclude
with
say
I
may
have
the
phaeton
to
take
me
to
O-
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
instead
of
repining
,
Miss
Grey
,
be
thankful
for
the
PRIVILEGES
you
enjoy
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
many
a
poor
clergyman
whose
family
would
be
plunge
into
ruin
by
the
event
of
his
death
;
but
you
,
you
see
,
have
influential
friend
ready
to
continue
their
patronage
,
and
to
show
you
every
consideration
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thank
her
for
her
"
consideration
,
"
and
fly
to
my
room
to
make
some
hurried
preparation
for
my
departure
.
 
<EOS>
My
bonnet
and
shawl
be
on
,
and
a
few
thing
hastily
cram
into
my
large
trunk
,
I
descend
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
may
have
do
the
work
more
leisurely
,
for
no
one
else
<EOS>
be
in
a
hurry
;
and
I
have
still
a
considerable
time
to
wait
for
the
phaeton
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
it
come
to
the
door
,
and
I
be
off
:
 
<EOS>
but
,
oh
,
what
a
dreary
journey
be
that
!
<EOS>
how
utterly
different
from
my
former
passage
homeward
!
 
<EOS>
be
too
late
for
the
last
coach
to
  
,
I
have
to
hire
a
cab
for
ten
mile
,
and
then
a
car
to
take
me
over
the
rugged
hill
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
half
-
past
ten
before
I
reach
home
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
not
in
bed
.
  
<EOS>
My
mother
and
sister
both
meet
me
in
the
passage
 
<EOS>
sad
 
silent
 
pale
!
<EOS>
I
be
so
much
shocked
and
terror
-
stricken
that
I
could
not
speak
,
to
ask
the
information
I
so
much
long
yet
dread
to
obtain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Agnes
!
<EOS>
"
say
my
mother
,
struggle
to
repress
some
strong
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Agnes
!
"
cry
Mary
,
and
burst
into
tear
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
he
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
gasp
for
the
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
dead
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
reply
I
have
anticipate
:
 
but
the
shock
seem
none
the
less
tremendous
.
    
<EOS>
the
LETTER
  
<EOS>
My
father
's
mortal
remain
have
be
consign
to
the
tomb
;
and
we
,
with
sad
face
and
sombre
garment
,
sit
linger
over
the
frugal
breakfast
-
table
,
revolving
plan
for
our
future
life
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
's
strong
mind
have
not
give
way
beneath
even
this
affliction
:
 
her
spirit
,
though
crush
,
be
not
break
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
's
wish
be
that
I
should
go
back
to
Horton
Lodge
,
and
that
our
mother
should
come
and
live
with
her
and
Mr.
Richardson
at
the
vicarage
:
 
<EOS>
she
affirm
that
he
wish
it
no
less
than
herself
,
and
that
such
an
arrangement
could
not
fail
to
benefit
all
party
;
for
my
mother
's
society
and
experience
would
be
of
inestimable
value
to
them
,
and
they
would
do
all
they
could
to
make
her
happy
.
 
<EOS>
but
no
argument
or
entreaty
could
prevail
:
 
<EOS>
my
mother
be
determine
not
to
go
.
<EOS>
not
that
she
question
,
for
a
moment
,
the
kind
wish
and
intention
of
her
daughter
;
but
she
affirm
that
so
long
as
God
spare
her
health
and
strength
,
she
would
make
use
of
them
to
earn
her
own
livelihood
,
and
be
chargeable
to
no
one
;
whether
her
dependence
would
be
feel
as
a
burden
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
could
afford
to
reside
as
a
lodger
in
 
vicarage
,
she
would
choose
that
house
before
all
other
as
the
place
of
her
abode
;
but
not
be
so
circumstance
,
she
would
never
come
under
its
roof
,
except
as
an
occasional
visitor
:
 
unless
sickness
or
calamity
should
render
her
assistance
really
needful
,
or
until
age
or
infirmity
make
her
incapable
of
maintain
herself
.

"
no
,
Mary
,
"
say
she
,
"
<EOS>
if
Richardson
and
you
have
anything
to
spare
,
you
must
lay
it
aside
for
your
family

and
Agnes
and
I
must
gather
honey
for
ourselves

<EOS>
thank
to
my

to
educate

I

my

God
willing

,
while
the
tear
course
one
another
down
her
cheek
in
spite
of
her
effort
;
but
she
wipe
them
away

and
resolutely
shake
back
her
head

continue
,
"
I
will
exert
myself
,
and
look
out
for
a
small
house

commodiously
situate

some

healthy
district

where
we
will
take
a

young

quite

take
from

bank
directly

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
when
it
be

the
house
,
and
settle
on
preliminary
first
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
offer
to
lend
the
little
she
possess
;
but
my
mother
decline
it
,
say
that
we
must
begin
on
an
economical
plan
;
and
she
hope
that
the
whole
or
part
of
mine
,
add
to
what
we
could
get
by
the
sale
of
the
furniture
,
and
what
little
our
dear
papa
have
contrive
to
lay
aside
for
her
since
the
debt
be
pay
,
would
be
sufficient
to
last
us
till
Christmas
;
when
,
it
be
hope
,
something
would
accrue
from
our
united
labours
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
finally
settle
that
this
should
be
our
plan
;
and
that
inquiry
and
preparation
should
immediately
be
set
on
foot
;
and
while
my
mother
busy
herself
with
these
,
I
should
return
to
Horton
Lodge
at
the
close
of
my
four
week
'
vacation
,
and
give
notice
for
my
final
departure
when
thing
be
in
train
for
the
speedy
commencement
of
our
school
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
discuss
these
affair
on
the
morning
I
have
mention
,
about
a
fortnight
after
my
father
's
death
,
when
a
letter
be
bring
in
for
my
mother
,
on
behold
which
the
colour
mount
to
her
face
 
lately
pale
enough
with
anxious
watching
and
excessive
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
"
from
my
father
!
"
<EOS>
murmur
she
,
as
she
hastily
tear
off
the
cover
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
many
year
since
she
have
hear
from
any
of
her
own
relation
before
.
 
<EOS>
naturally
wonder
what
the
letter
may
contain
,
I
watch
her
countenance
while
she
read
it
,
and
be
somewhat
surprised
to
see
her
bite
her
lip
and
knit
her
brow
as
if
in
anger
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
have
do
,
she
somewhat
irreverently
cast
it
on
the
table
,
say
with
a
scornful
smile
,
 
<EOS>
"
Your
grandpapa
have
be
so
kind

to
write
to
me

I
have
long
repent
of
my
"
unfortunate
marriage
,
"
and
if
I
will
only
acknowledge
this
,
and
confess
I
be
wrong
in
neglect
his
advice
,
and
that
I
have
justly
suffer
for
it
,
he
will
make
a
lady
of
me
once
again
 
if
that
be
possible
after
my
long
degradation
 
and
remember
my
girl
in
his
will
.
 
<EOS>
get
my
desk
,
agne
,
and
send
these
thing
away
:
 
<EOS>
I
will
answer
the
letter
directly
.
 
<EOS>
but
first
,
as
I
may
be
deprive
you
both
of
a
legacy
,
it
be
just
that
I
should
tell
you
what
I
mean
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
say
that
he
be
mistaken
in
supposing
that
I
can
regret
the
birth
of
my
daughter
(
who
have
be
the
pride
of
my
life
,
and
be
likely
to
be
the
comfort
of
my
old
age
)
,
or
the
thirty
year
I
have
pass
in
the
company
of
my
good
and
dear
friend
;
 
that
,
have
our
misfortune
be
three
time
as
great
as
they
be
(
unless
they
have
be
of
my
bringing
on
)
,
I
should
still
the
more
rejoice
to
have
share
them
with
your
father
,
and
administer
what
consolation
I
be
able
;
and
,
have
his
suffering
in
illness
be
ten
time
what
they
wear
,
I
could
not
regret
have
watch
over
and
labour
to
relieve
them
;
 
that
,
if
he
have
marry
a
rich
wife
,
misfortune
and
trial
would
no
doubt
have
come
upon
him
still
;
while
I
be
egotist
enough
to
imagine
that
no
other
woman
could
have
cheer
him
through
them
so
well
:
 
not
that
I
be
superior
to
the
rest
,
but
I
be
make
for
him
,
and
he
for
me
;
and
I
can
no
more
repent
the
hour
,
day
,
year
of
happiness
we
have
spend
together
,
and
which
neither
could
have
have
without
the
other
,
than
I
can
the
privilege
of
have
be
his
nurse
in
sickness
,
and
his
comfort
in
affliction
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
this
do
,
child
?
 
<EOS>
or
shall
I
say
we
be
all
very
sorry
for
what
have
happen
during
the
last
thirty
year
,
and
my
daughter
wish
they
have
never
be
bear
;
but
since
they
have
have
that
misfortune
,
they
will
be
thankful
for
any
trifle
<EOS>
their
grandpapa
will
be
kind
enough
to
bestow
?
"
  
<EOS>
of
course
,
we
both
applaud
our
mother
's
resolution
;
Mary
clear
away
the
breakfast
thing
;
I
bring
the
desk
;
the
letter
be
quickly
write
and
despatch
;
and
,
from
that
day
,
we
hear
no
more
of
our
grandfather
,
till
we
see
his
death
announce
in
the
newspaper
a
considerable
time
after
 
all
his
worldly
possession

our

the
FAREWELL

in
a

the
fashionable

place
,
be
hire
for
our
seminary
;
and
a
promise
of
two
or
three
pupil
be
obtain
to
commence
with
.
 
<EOS>
I
return
to
Horton
Lodge
about
the
middle
of
July
,
leave
my
mother
to
conclude
the
bargain
for
the
house
,
to
obtain
more
pupil
,
to
sell
off
the
furniture
of
our
old
abode
,
and
to
fit
out
the
new
one
.
  
<EOS>
We
often
pity
the
poor
,
because
they
have
no
leisure
to
mourn
their
depart
relative
,
and
necessity
oblige
them
to
labour
through
their
severe
affliction
:
 
but
be
not
active
employment
the
good
remedy
for
overwhelming
sorrow
 
<EOS>
the
sure
antidote
for
despair
?
<EOS>
It
may
be
a
rough
comforter
:
 
<EOS>
it
may
seem
hard
to
be
harass
with
the
care
of
life
when
we
have
no
relish
for
its
enjoyment
;
to
be
goad
to
labour
when
the
heart
be
ready
to
break
,
and
the
vexed
spirit
implore
for
rest
only
to
weep
in
silence
:
 
but
be
not
labour
well
than
the
rest
we
covet
?
<EOS>
and
be
not
those
petty
,
torment
care
less
hurtful
than
a
continual
brooding
over
the
great
affliction
that
oppress
us
?
 
<EOS>
besides
,
we
can
not
have
care
,
and
anxiety
,
and
toil
,
without
hope
 
if
it
be
<EOS>
but
the
hope
of
fulfil
our
joyless
task
,
accomplish
some
needful
project
,
or
escape
some
further
annoyance
.
 
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
I
be
glad
my
mother
have
so
much
employment
for
every
faculty
of
her
action
-
love
frame
.
 
<EOS>
Our
kind
neighbour
lament
that
she
,
once
so
exalted
in
wealth
and
station
,
should
be
reduce
to
such
extremity
in
her
time
of
sorrow
;
but
I
be
persuade
that
she
would
have
suffer
thrice
as
much
have
she
be
leave
in
affluence
,
with
liberty
to
remain
in
that
house
,
the
scene
of
her
early
happiness
and
late
affliction
,
and
no
stern
necessity
to
prevent
her
from
incessantly
brood
over
and
lament
her
bereavement
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
dilate
upon
the
feeling
with
which
I
leave
the
old
house
,
the
well
-
know
garden
,
the
little
village
church
 
then
doubly
dear
to
me
,
because
my
father
,
who
,
for
thirty
year
,
have
teach
and
pray
within
its
wall
,
lie
slumber
now
beneath
its
flag
 
and
the
old
bare
hill
,
delightful
in
their
very
desolation
,
with
the
narrow
vale
between
,
smile
in
green
wood
and
sparkling
water
 
<EOS>
the
house
where
I
be
bear
,
the
scene
of
all
my
early
association
,
the
place
where
throughout
life
my
earthly
affection
have
be
centre
;
 
and
leave
them
to
return
no
more
!
 
<EOS>
true
,
I
be
go
back
to
Horton
Lodge
,
where
,
amid
many
evil
,
one
source
of
pleasure
yet
remain
:
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
pleasure
mingle
with
excessive
pain
;
and
my
stay
,
alas
!
<EOS>
be
limit
to
six
week
.
 
<EOS>
and
even
of
that
precious
time
,
day
after
day
slip
by
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
see
him
:
except
at
church
<EOS>
,
I
never
see
him
for
a
fortnight
after
my
return
.
<EOS>
It
seem
a
long
time
to
me
:
 
and
,
as
I
be
often
out
with
my
rambling
pupil
,
of
course
hope
would
keep
rise
,
and
disappointment
would
ensue
;
and
then
,
I
would
say
to
my
own
heart
,
"
here
be
a
convincing
proof
 
if
you
would
but
have
the
sense
to
see
it
,
or
the
candour
to
acknowledge
it
 
that
he
do
not
care
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
only
think
half
as
much
about
you
as
you
do
about
him
,
he
would
have
contrive
to
meet
you
many
time
<EOS>
ere
this
:
 
<EOS>
you
must
know
that
,
by
consult
your
own
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
have
do
with
this
nonsense
:
 
<EOS>
you
have
no
ground
for
hope
:
 
dismiss
,
at
once
,
these
hurtful
thought
and
foolish
wish
from
your
mind
,
and
turn
to
your
own
duty
,
and
the
dull
blank
life
that
lie
before
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
have
know
such
happiness
be
not
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
I
see
him
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
suddenly
upon
me
as
I
be
cross
a
field
in
return
from
a
visit
to
Nancy
Brown
,
which
I
have
take
the
opportunity
of
pay
while
Matilda
Murray
be
ride
her
matchless
mare
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
have
hear
of
the
heavy
loss
I
have
sustain
:
 
<EOS>
he
express
no
sympathy
,
offer
no
condolence
:
 
<EOS>
but
almost
the
first
word
he
utter
be
,
 
<EOS>
"
how
be
your
mother
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
this
be
no
matter
-
of
-
course
question
,
for
I
never
tell
him
that
I
have
a
mother
:
 
<EOS>
he
must
have
learn
the
fact
from
other
,
if
he
know
it
at
all
;
and
,
besides
,
there
be
sincere
goodwill
,
and
even
deep
,
touching
,
unobtrusive
sympathy
in
the
tone
and
manner
of
the
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
him
with
due
civility
,
and
tell
him
she
be
as
well
as
could
be
expect
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
will
she
do
?
<EOS>
"
be
the
next
question
.
 
<EOS>
many
would
have
deem
it
an
impertinent
one
,
and
give
an
evasive
reply
;
but
such
an
idea
never
enter
my
head
,
and
I
give
a
brief
but
plain
statement
of
my
mother
's
plan
and
prospect
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
will
leave
this
place
shortly
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
in
a
month
.
"
  
He
pause
a
minute
,
as
if
in
thought
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
speak
again
,
I
hope
it
would
be
to
express
his
concern
at
my
departure
;
but
it
be
only
to
say
,
 
"
I
should
think
you
will
be
willing
enough
to
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
 
for
some
thing
,
"
I
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
for
some
thing
only
 
I
wonder
what
should
make
you
regret
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
annoy
at
this
in
some
degree
;
because
it
embarrass
me
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
one
reason
for
regret
it
;
and
that
be
a
profound
secret
,
which
he
have
no
business
to
trouble
me
about
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
"
say
I
"
why
should
you
suppose
that
I
dislike
the
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
tell
me
<EOS>
so
yourself
,
"
be
the
decisive
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
say
,
at
least
,
that
you
could
not
live
contentedly
,
without
a
friend
;
and
that
you
have
no
friend
here
,
and
no
possibility
of
make
one
 
and
,
besides
<EOS>
,
I
know
you
MUST
dislike
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
you
remember
rightly
,
I
say
,
or
mean
to
say
,
I
could
not
live
contentedly
without
a
friend
in
the
world
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
so
unreasonable
as
to
require
one
always
near
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
could
be
happy
in
a
house
full
of
enemy
,
if
"
but
no
;
that
sentence
must
not
be
continue
 
I
pause
,
and
hastily
add
,
 
"
<EOS>
and
,
besides
,
we
can
not
well
leave
a
place
where
we
have
live
for
two
or
three
year
,
without
some
feeling
of
regret
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Will
you
regret
to
part
with
Miss
Murray
,
your
sole
remain
pupil
and
companion
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
I
shall
in
some
degree
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
not
without
sorrow
I
part
with
her
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
imagine
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Miss
Matilda
be
quite
as
good
 
better
in
one
respect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
honest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
the
other
be
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
call
her
dishonest
;
but
it
must
be
confess
she
be
a
little
artful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ARTFUL
be
she
?
 
<EOS>
I
see
she
be
giddy
and
vain
 
and
now
<EOS>
,
"
he
add
,
after
a
pause
,
"
I
can
well
believe
she
be
artful
too
;
but
so
excessively
so
as
to
assume
an
aspect
of
extreme
simplicity
and
unguarded
openness
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
"
continue
he
,
musingly
,
"
that
account
for
some
little
thing
that
puzzle
me
a
trifle
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
that
,
he
turn
the
conversation
to
more
general
subject
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
leave
me
till
we
have
nearly
reach
the
park
-
gate
:
 
<EOS>
he
have
certainly
step
a
little
out
of
his
way
to
accompany
me
so
far
,
for
he
now
go
back
and
disappear
down
Moss
Lane
,
the
entrance
of
which
we
have
pass
some
time
before
.
 
<EOS>
assuredly
I
do
not
regret
this
circumstance
:
 
if
sorrow
have
any
place
in
my
heart
,
it
be
that
he
be
go
at
last
 
that
he
be
no
longer
walk
by
my
side
,
and
that
that
short
interval
of
delightful
intercourse
be
at
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
breathe
a
word
of
love
,
or
drop
one
hint
of
tenderness
or
affection
,
and
yet
I
have
be
supremely
happy
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
near
him
,
to
hear
him
talk
as
he
do
talk
,
and
to
feel
that
he
think
me
worthy
to
be
so
spoken
to
 
capable
of
understanding
and
duly
appreciate
such
discourse
 
be
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Edward
Weston
,
I
could
indeed
be
happy
in
a
house
full
of
enemy
,
if
I
have
but
<EOS>
one
friend
,
who
truly
,
deeply
,
and
faithfully
love
me
;
and
if
that
friend
be
you
 
though
we
may
be
far
apart
 
seldom
to
hear
from
each
other
,
still
more
seldom
to
meet
 
though
toil
,
and
trouble
,
and
vexation
may
surround
me
,
still
 
it
would
be
too
much
happiness
for
me
to
dream
of
!
 
<EOS>
yet
who
can
tell
,
"
say
I
within
myself
,
as
I
proceed
up
the
park
,
 
"
who
can
tell
what
this
one
month
may
bring
forth
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
live
nearly
three-
and
-
twenty
year
,
and
I
have
suffer
much
,
and
taste
little
pleasure
yet
;
be
it
likely
my
life
all
through
will
be
so
clouded
?
<EOS>
be
it
not
possible
that
God
may
hear
my
prayer
,
disperse
these
gloomy
shadow
,
and
grant
me
some
beam
of
heaven
's
sunshine
yet
?
<EOS>
Will
He
entirely
deny
to
me
those
blessing
which
be
so
freely
give
to
other
,
who
neither
ask
them
nor
acknowledge
them
when
receive
?
 
<EOS>
May
I
not
still
hope
and
trust
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
hope
and
trust
for
a
while
:
 
<EOS>
but
,
alas
,
alas
!
<EOS>
the
time
ebb
away
:
 
one
week
follow
another
,
and
,
except
one
distant
glimpse
and
two
transient
meeting
 
during
which
scarcely
anything
be
say
 
while
I
be
walk
with
Miss
Matilda
<EOS>
,
I
see
nothing
of
him
:
 
except
,
of
course
,
at
church
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
,
the
last
Sunday
be
come
,
and
<EOS>
the
last
service
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
often
on
the
point
of
melt
into
tear
during
the
sermon
 
<EOS>
the
last
<EOS>
I
be
to
hear
from
him
:
 
<EOS>
the
good
I
should
hear
from
anyone
,
I
be
well
assure
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
over
 
the
congregation
be
depart
;
and
I
must
follow
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
then
see
him
,
and
hear
his
voice
,
too
,
probably
for
the
last
time
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
churchyard
,
Matilda
be
pounce
upon
by
the
two
Misses
Green
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
many
inquiry
to
make
about
her
sister
,
and
I
know
not
what
besides
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
wish
they
would
have
do
,
that
we
may
hasten
back
to
Horton
Lodge
:
 
<EOS>
I
long
to
seek
the
retirement
of
my
own
room
,
or
some
sequester
nook
in
the
ground
,
that
I
may
deliver
myself
up
to
my
feeling
 
to
weep
my
last
farewell
,
and
lament
my
false
hope
and
vain
delusion
.
 
<EOS>
only
this
once
,
and
then
adieu
to
fruitless
dream
 
thenceforth
,
only
sober
,
solid
,
sad
reality
should
occupy
my
mind
.
<EOS>
but
while
I
thus
resolve
,
a
low
voice
close
beside
me
say
"
I
suppose
you
be
go
this
week
,
Miss
Grey
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
reply
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
startled
;
and
have
I
be
at
all
hysterically
inclined
,
I
certainly
should
have
commit
myself
in
some
way
then
.
 
<EOS>
thank
God
,
I
be
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Mr.
Weston
,
"
I
want
to
bid
you
good
-
<EOS>
bye
 
<EOS>
it
be
not
likely
I
shall
see
you
again
before
you
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
-
bye
,
Mr.
Weston
,
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
how
I
struggle
to
say
it
calmly
!
 
<EOS>
I
give
him
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
retain
it
a
few
second
in
his
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
possible
we
may
meet
again
,
"
say
he
;
"
will
it
be
of
any
consequence
to
you
whether
we
do
or
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
should
be
very
glad
to
see
you
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
COULD
say
no
less
.
 
<EOS>
He
kindly
press
my
hand
,
and
go
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
I
be
happy
again
 
though
more
inclined
to
burst
into
tear
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
be
force
to
speak
at
that
moment
,
a
succession
of
sobs
would
have
inevitably
ensue
;
and
as
it
be
,
I
could
not
keep
the
water
out
of
my
eye
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
along
with
Miss
Murray
,
turn
aside
my
face
,
and
neglect
to
notice
several
successive
remark
,
till
she
bawl
out
that
I
be
either
deaf
or
stupid
;
and
then
(
have
recover
my
self
-
possession
)
,
as
one
awaken
from
a
fit
of
abstraction
,
I
suddenly
look
up
and
ask
what
she
have
be
say
.
    
<EOS>
the
SCHOOL
  
<EOS>
I
leave
Horton
Lodge
,
and
go
to
join
my
mother
in
our
new
abode
at
A-
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
her
well
in
health
,
resign
in
spirit
,
and
even
cheerful
,
though
subdued
and
sober
,
in
her
general
demeanour
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
only
three
boarder
and
half
a
dozen
day
-
pupil
to
commence
with
;
but
by
due
care
and
diligence
we
hope
ere
long
to
increase
the
number
of
both
.
  
<EOS>
I
set
myself
with
befitting
energy
to
discharge
the
duty
of
this
new
mode
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
it
NEW
<EOS>
,
for
there
be
,
indeed
,
a
considerable
difference
between
work
with
my
mother
in
a
school
of
our
own
,
and
work
as
a
hireling
among
stranger
,
despise
and
trample
upon
by
old
and
young
;
and
for
the
first
few
week
I
be
by
no
means
unhappy
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
possible
we
may
meet
again
,
"
and
"
will
it
be
of
any
consequence
to
you
whether
we
do
or
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
those
word
still
ring
in
my
ear
and
rest
on
my
heart
:
 
<EOS>
they
be
my
secret
solace
and
support
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
see
him
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
come
;
or
he
will
write
.
"
 
<EOS>
no
promise
,
in
fact
,
be
too
bright
or
too
extravagant
for
Hope
to
whisper
in
my
ear
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
half
of
what
she
tell
me
:
 
I
pretend
to
laugh
at
it
all
;
but
I
be
far
more
credulous
than
I
myself
suppose
;
otherwise
,
why
do
my
heart
leap
up
when
a
knock
be
hear
at
the
front
door
,
and
the
maid
,
who
open
it
,
come
to
tell
my
mother
a
gentleman
wish
to
see
her
?
<EOS>
and
why
be
I
out
of
humour
for
the
rest
of
the
day
,
because
it
prove
to
be
a
music
-
master
come
to
offer
his
service
to
our
school
?
<EOS>
and
what
stop
my
breath
for
a
moment
,
when
the
postman
have
bring
a
couple
of
letter
,
my
mother
say
,
"
here
,
Agnes
,
this
be
for
you
,
"
and
throw
one
of
them
to
me
?
<EOS>
and
what
make
the
hot
blood
rush
into
my
face
when
I
see
it
be
direct
in
a
gentleman
's
hand
?
<EOS>
and
why
 
oh
!
<EOS>
why
do
that
cold
,
sickening
sense
of
disappointment
fall
upon
me
,
when
I
have
tear
open
the
cover
and
find
it
be
only
a
letter
from
Mary
,
which
,
for
some
reason
or
other
,
her
husband
have
direct
for
her
?
  
<EOS>
be
<EOS>
it
then
come
to
this
 
that
I
should
be
disappoint
to
receive
a
letter
from
my
only
sister
:
 
and
because
it
be
not
write
by
a
comparative
stranger
?
 
<EOS>
Dear
Mary
!
<EOS>
and
she
have
write
it
so
kindly
 
and
think
I
should
be
so
pleased
to
have
it
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
worthy
to
read
it
!
 
<EOS>
and
I
believe
,
in
my
indignation
against
myself
,
I
should
have
put
it
aside
till
I
have
school
myself
into
a
well
frame
of
mind
,
and
be
become
more
deserving
of
the
honour
and
privilege
of
its
perusal
:
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
my
mother
look
on
,
and
wishful
to
know
what
news
it
contain
;
so
I
read
it
and
deliver
it
to
her
,
and
then
go
into
the
schoolroom
to
attend
to
the
pupil
:
 
but
amidst
the
care
of
copy
and
sum
 
in
the
interval
of
correct
error
here
,
and
reprove
dereliction
of
duty
there
,
I
be
inwardly
take
myself
to
task
with
far
sterner
severity
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
a
fool
you
must
be
,
"
say
my
head
to
my
heart
,
or
my
sterner
to
my
soft
self
;
 
<EOS>
"
how
could
you
ever
dream
that
he
would
write
to
you
?
 
<EOS>
what
ground
have
you
for
such
a
hope
 
or
that
he
will
see
you
,
or
give
himself
any
trouble
about
you
 
or
even
think
of
you
again
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
ground
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
Hope
set
before
me
that
last
,
short
interview
,
and
repeat
the
word
I
have
so
faithfully
treasure
in
my
memory
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
and
what
be
there
in
that
?
 
<EOS>
who
ever
hang
his
hope
upon
so
frail
a
twig
?
 
<EOS>
what
be
there
in
those
word
that
any
common
acquaintance
may
not
say
to
another
?
 
<EOS>
of
course
,
it
be
possible
you
may
meet
again
:
 
<EOS>
he
may
have
say
<EOS>
so
if
you
have
be
go
to
New
Zealand
;
but
that
do
not
imply
any
intention
of
see
you
 
and
then
,
as
to
the
question
that
follow
,
anyone
may
ask
that
:
 
and
how
do
you
answer
?
 
<EOS>
merely
with
a
stupid
,
commonplace
reply
,
such
as
you
would
have
give
to
Master
Murray
,
or
anyone
else
you
have
be
on
tolerably
civil
term
with
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
then
,
"
persist
Hope
,
"
the
tone
and
manner
in
which
he
speak
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
that
be
nonsense
!
<EOS>
he
always
speak
impressively
;
and
at
that
moment
there
be
the
Greens
and
Miss
Matilda
Murray
just
before
,
and
other
people
pass
by
,
and
he
be
oblige
to
stand
close
beside
you
,
and
to
speak
very
low
,
unless
he
wish
everybody
to
hear
what
he
say
,
<EOS>
which
 
though
it
be
nothing
at
all
particular
 
of
course
,
he
would
rather
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
then
,
above
all
,
that
emphatic
,
yet
gentle
pressure
of
the
hand
,
which
seem
to
say
,
"
trust
me
;
"
and
many
other
thing
besides
 
too
delightful
,
almost
too
flattering
,
to
be
repeat
even
to
one
's
self
.
 
<EOS>
"
egregious
folly
 
too
absurd
to
require
contradiction
 
mere
invention
of
the
imagination
,
which
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
would
but
consider
your
own
unattractive
exterior
,
your
unamiable
reserve
,
your
foolish
diffidence
 
which
must
make
you
appear
cold
,
dull
,
awkward
,
and
perhaps
ill
-
temper
too
;
 
if
you
have
but
rightly
consider
these
from
the
beginning
,
you
would
never
have
harbour
such
presumptuous
thought
:
 
and
now
that
you
have
be
so
foolish
,
pray
repent
and
amend
,
and
let
us
have
no
more
of
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
I
implicitly
obey
my
own
injunction
:
 
but
such
reasoning
as
this
become
more
and
more
effective
as
time
wear
on
,
and
nothing
be
see
or
hear
of
Mr.
Weston
;
until
,
at
last
,
I
give
up
hope
,
for
even
my
heart
acknowledge
it
be
all
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
but
still
,
I
would
think
of
him
:
 
I
would
cherish
his
image
in
my
mind
;
and
treasure
every
word
,
look
,
and
gesture
that
my
memory
could
retain
;
and
brood
over
his
excellence
and
his
peculiarity
,
and
,
in
fact
,
all
I
have
see
,
hear
,
or
imagine
respect
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
agne
,
this
sea
air
and
change
of
scene
do
you
<EOS>
no
good
<EOS>
,
I
think
:
<EOS>
I
never
see
you
look
so
wretched
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
that
you
sit
too
much
,
and
allow
the
care
of
the
schoolroom
to
worry
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
learn
to
take
thing
easy
,
and
to
be
more
active
and
cheerful
;
you
must
take
exercise
whenever
you
can
get
it
,
and
leave
the
most
tiresome
duty
to
me
:
 
they
will
only
serve
to
exercise
my
patience
,
and
,
perhaps
,
try
my
temper
a
little
.
"
  
<EOS>
so
say
my
mother
,
as
we
sit
at
work
one
morning
during
the
Easter
holiday
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
her
that
my
employment
be
not
at
all
oppressive
;
that
I
be
well
;
or
,
if
there
be
anything
<EOS>
amiss
,
it
would
be
go
as
soon
as
the
try
month
of
spring
be
over
:
<EOS>
when
summer
come
I
should
be
as
strong
and
hearty
as
she
could
wish
to
see
me
:
 
but
inwardly
her
observation
startle
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
my
strength
be
decline
,
my
appetite
have
fail
,
and
I
be
grow
listless
and
desponding
;
 
and
if
,
indeed
,
he
could
never
care
for
me
,
and
I
could
never
see
him
more
 
if
I
be
forbid
to
minister
to
his
happiness
 
<EOS>
forbid
,
for
ever
,
to
taste
the
joy
of
love
,
to
bless
,
and
to
be
bless
 
<EOS>
then
,
life
must
be
a
burden
,
and
if
my
heavenly
Father
would
call
me
away
,
I
should
be
glad
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
would
not
do
to
die
and
leave
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
selfish
,
unworthy
daughter
,
to
forget
her
for
a
moment
!
 
<EOS>
be
not
her
happiness
commit
in
a
great
measure
to
my
charge
?
 
<EOS>
and
the
welfare
of
our
young
pupil
too
?
 
<EOS>
Should
I
shrink
from
the
work
that
God
have
set
before
me
,
because
it
be
not
fit
to
my
taste
?
 
<EOS>
do
not
He
know
good
what
I
should
do
,
and
where
I
ought
to
labour
?
 
<EOS>
and
should
I
long
to
quit
His
service
before
I
have
finish
my
task
,
and
expect
to
enter
into
His
rest
without
have
labour
to
earn
it
?
 
<EOS>
"
no
;
by
His
help
I
will
arise
and
address
myself
diligently
to
my
appoint
duty
.
 
<EOS>
if
happiness
in
this
world
be
not
for
me
,
I
will
endeavour
to
promote
the
welfare
of
those
around
me
,
and
my
reward
shall
be
hereafter
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
I
in
my
heart
;
and
from
that
hour
I
only
permit
my
thought
to
wander
to
Edward
Weston
 
or
at
least
to
dwell
upon
him
now
and
then
 
as
a
treat
for
rare
occasion
:
 
and
,
whether
it
be
really
the
approach
of
summer
or
the
effect
of
these
good
resolution
,
or
the
lapse
of
time
,
or
all
together
,
tranquillity
of
mind
be
soon
restore
;
and
bodily
health
and
vigour
begin
likewise
,
slowly
,
but
surely
,
to
return
.
  
<EOS>
early
in
June
,
I
receive
a
letter
from
Lady
Ashby
,
late
Miss
Murray
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
write
to
me
twice
or
thrice
before
,
from
the
different
stage
of
her
bridal
tour
,
always
in
good
spirit
,
and
profess
to
be
very
happy
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
every
time
that
she
have
not
forget
me
,
in
the
midst
of
so
much
gaiety
and
variety
of
scene
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
there
be
a
pause
;
and
it
seem
she
have
forget
me
,
for
upward
of
seven
month
<EOS>
pass
away
and
no
letter
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
do
not
break
my
heart
about
that
,
though
I
often
wonder
how
she
be
get
on
;
and
when
this
last
epistle
so
unexpectedly
arrive
,
I
be
glad
enough
to
receive
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
date
from
Ashby
Park
,
where
she
be
come
to
settle
down
at
last
,
have
previously
divide
her
time
between
the
continent
and
the
metropolis
.
 
<EOS>
She
make
many
apology
for
have
neglect
me
so
long
,
assure
me
she
have
not
forget
me
,
and
have
often
intend
to
write
,
&
c.
&
c.
,
but
have
always
be
prevent
by
something
.
 
<EOS>
She
acknowledge
that
she
have
be
lead
a
very
dissipated
life
,
and
I
should
think
her
very
wicked
and
very
thoughtless
;
but
,
notwithstanding
that
,
she
think
a
great
deal
,
and
,
among
other
thing
,
that
she
should
vastly
like
to
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
be
several
day
here
already
,
"
write
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
not
a
single
friend
with
us
,
and
be
likely
to
be
very
dull
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
I
never
have
a
fancy
for
live
with
my
husband
like
two
turtle
in
a
nest
,
be
he
the
most
delightful
creature
that
ever
wear
a
coat
;
so
do
take
pity
upon
me
and
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
your
Midsummer
holiday
commence
in
June
,
the
same
as
other
people
's
;
therefore
you
can
not
plead
want
of
time
;
and
you
must
and
shall
come
 
in
fact
,
I
shall
die
if
you
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
visit
me
as
a
friend
,
and
stay
a
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nobody
with
me
,
as
I
tell
you
before
,
but
Sir
Thomas
and
old
Lady
Ashby
:
 
but
you
need
not
mind
them
 
they
will
trouble
us
but
little
with
their
company
.
 
<EOS>
and
you
shall
have
a
room
to
yourself
,
whenever
you
like
to
retire
to
it
,
and
plenty
of
book
to
read
when
my
company
be
not
sufficiently
amusing
.
 
<EOS>
I
forget
whether
you
like
baby
;
if
you
do
,
you
may
have
the
pleasure
of
see
mine
 
the
most
charming
child
in
the
world
,
no
doubt
;
and
all
the
more
so
,
that
I
be
not
trouble
with
nursing
it
 
<EOS>
I
be
determine
I
would
not
be
bother
with
that
.
 
<EOS>
unfortunately
,
it
be
a
girl
,
and
Sir
Thomas
have
never
forgive
me
:
 
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
if
you
will
only
come
,
I
promise
you
shall
be
its
governess
as
soon
as
it
can
speak
;
and
you
shall
bring
it
up
in
the
way
it
should
go
,
and
make
a
well
woman
of
it
than
its
mamma
.
 
<EOS>
and
you
shall
see
my
poodle
,
too
:
 
a
splendid
little
charmer
import
from
Paris
:
 
and
two
fine
italian
painting
of
great
value
 
<EOS>
I
forget
the
artist
.
<EOS>
doubtless
you
will
be
able
to
discover
prodigious
beauty
in
them
,
which
you
must
point
out
to
me
,
as
I
only
admire
by
hearsay
;
and
many
elegant
curiosity
besides
,
which
I
purchase
at
Rome
and
elsewhere
;
and
,
finally
,
you
shall
see
my
new
home
 
<EOS>
the
splendid
house
and
ground
I
use
to
covet
so
greatly
.
 
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
how
far
the
promise
of
anticipation
exceed
the
pleasure
of
possession
!
<EOS>
there
be
a
fine
sentiment
!
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
be
become
quite
a
grave
old
matron
:
 
pray
come
,
if
it
be
only
to
witness
the
wonderful
change
.
 
<EOS>
write
by
return
of
post
,
and
tell
me
when
your
vacation
commence
,
and
say
that
you
will

<EOS>
I
show
this
strange
epistle
to
my
mother
,
and
consult
her
on
what
I
ought
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
She
advise
me
to
go
;
and
I
go
 
willing
enough
to
see
Lady
Ashby
,
and
her
baby
,
too
,
and
to
do
anything
I
could
to
benefit
her
,
by
consolation
or
advice
;
for
I
imagine
she
must
be
unhappy
,
or
she
would
not
have
apply
to
me
thus
 
but
feel
,
as
may
readily
be
conceive
,
that
,
in
accept
the
invitation
,
I
make
a
great
sacrifice
for
her
,
and
do
violence
to
my
feeling
in
many
way
,
instead
of
be
delighted
with
the
honourable
distinction
of
be
entreat
by
the
baronet
's
lady
to
visit
her
as
a
friend
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
determine
my
visit
should
be
only
for
a
few
day
at
most
;
and
I
will
not
deny
that
I
derive
some
consolation
from
the
idea
that
,
as
Ashby
Park
be
not
very
far
from
Horton
<EOS>
,
I
may
possibly
see
Mr.
Weston
,
or
,
at
least
,
hear
something
about
him
.
    
<EOS>
the
VISIT
  
<EOS>
Ashby
Park
be
certainly
a
very
delightful
residence
.
 
<EOS>
the
mansion
be
stately
without
,
commodious
and
elegant
within
;
the
park
be
spacious
and
beautiful
,
chiefly
on
account
of
its
magnificent
old
tree
,
its
stately
herd
of
deer
,
its
broad
sheet
of
water
,
and
the
ancient
wood
that
stretch
beyond
it
:
 
<EOS>
for
there
be
no
broken
ground
to
give
variety
to
the
landscape
,
and
<EOS>
but
very
little
of
that
undulating
swell
which
add
so
greatly
to
the
charm
of
park
scenery
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
this
be
the
place
Rosalie
Murray
have
so
long
to
call
her
own
,
that
she
must
have
a
share
of
it
,
<EOS>
on
whatever
term
it
may
be
offer
 
whatever
price
be
to
be
pay
for
the
title
of
mistress
,
and
whoever
be
to
be
her
partner
in
the
honour
and
bliss
of
such
a
possession
!
 
<EOS>
well
I
be
not
dispose
to
censure
her
now
.
  
<EOS>
She
receive
me
very
kindly
;
and
,
though
I
be
a
poor
clergyman
's
daughter
,
a
governess
,
and
a
schoolmistress
,
she
welcome
me
with
unaffected
pleasure
to
her
home
;
and
 
what
surprise
me
<EOS>
rather
 
take
some
pain
to
make
my
visit
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
see
,
it
be
true
,
that
she
expect
me
to
be
greatly
strike
with
the
magnificence
that
surround
her
;
and
,
I
confess
,
I
be
rather
annoy
at
her
evident
effort
to
reassure
me
,
and
prevent
me
from
be
overwhelm
by
so
much
grandeur
 
too
much
awe
at
the
idea
of
encounter
her
husband
and
mother
-
in
-
law
,
or
too
much
ashamed
of
my
own
humble
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
ashamed
of
it
at
all
;
for
,
though
plain
,
I
have
take
good
care
not
to
shabby
or
mean
,
and
should
have
be
pretty
considerably
at
my
ease
,
if
my
condescending
hostess
have
not
take
such
manif
pain
to
make
me
so
;
and
,
as
for
the
magnificence
that
surround
her
,
nothing
that
meet
my
eye
strike
me
or
affect
me
half
so
much
as
her
own
altered
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
whether
from
the
influence
of
fashionable
dissipation
,
or
some
other
evil
,
a
space
of
little
more
than
twelve
month
have
have
the
effect
that
may
be
expect
from
as
many
year
,
in
reduce
the
plumpness
of
her
form
,
the
freshness
of
her
complexion
,
the
vivacity
of
her
movement
,
and
the
exuberance
of
her
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
to
know
if
she
be
unhappy
;
but
I
feel
it
be
not
my
province
to
inquire
:
 
I
may
endeavour
to
win
her
confidence
;
but
,
if
she
choose
to
conceal
her
matrimonial
care
from
me
,
I
would
trouble
her
with
no
obtrusive
question
.
 
<EOS>
I
,
therefore
,
at
first
,
confine
myself
to
a
few
general
inquiry
about
her
health
and
welfare
,
and
a
few
commendation
on
the
beauty
of
the
park
,
and
of
the
little
girl
that
should
have
be
a
boy
:
 
a
small
delicate
infant
of
seven
or
eight
week
old
,
whom
its
mother
seem
to
regard
with
no
remarkable
degree
of
interest
or
affection
,
though
full
as
much
as
I
expect
her
to
show
.
  
<EOS>
shortly
after
my
arrival
,
she
commission
her
maid
to
conduct
me
to
my
room
and
see
that
I
have
everything
I
want
;
it
be
a
small
,
unpretende
,
but
sufficiently
comfortable
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
descend
thence
 
have
divest
myself
of
all
travel
encumbrance
,
and
arrange
my
toilet
with
due
consideration
for
the
feeling
of
my
lady
hostess
,
she
conduct
me
herself
to
the
room
I
be
to
occupy
when
I
choose
to
be
alone
,
or
when
she
be
engage
with
visitor
,
or
oblige
to
be
with
her
mother
-
in
-
law
,
or
otherwise
prevent
,
as
she
say
,
from
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
my
society
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
quiet
,
tidy
little
sitting
-
room
;
and
I
be
not
sorry
to
be
provide
with
such
a
harbour
of
refuge
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
some
time
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
will
show
you
the
library
:
 
<EOS>
I
never
examine
its
shelf
,
but
,
I
daresay
,
it
be
full
of
wise
book
;
and
you
may
go
and
burrow
among
them
whenever
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
you
shall
have
some
tea
 
<EOS>
it
will
soon
be
dinner
-
time
,
but
I
think
,
as
you
be
accustomed
to
dine
at
one
,
you
would
perhaps
like
better
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
about
this
time
,
and
to
dine
when
we
lunch
:
and
then
,
you
know
,
you
can
have
your
tea
in
this
room
,
and
that
will
save
you
from
have
to
dine
with
Lady
Ashby
and
Sir
Thomas
:
which
would
be
rather
awkward
 
at
least
,
not
awkward
,
but
rather
 
a
 
<EOS>
you
know
what
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
you
might
not
like
it
<EOS>
so
well
 
especially
as
we
may
have
other
lady
and
gentleman
to
dine
with
us
occasionally
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
certainly
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
would
much
rather
have
it
as
you
say
,
and
,
if
you
have
no
objection
,
I
should
prefer
have
all
my
meal
in
this
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
because
,
I
imagine
,
it
would
be
more
agreeable
to
Lady
Ashby
and
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
nothing
of
the
kind
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
at
any
rate
it
would
be
more
agreeable
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
make
some
faint
objection
,
but
soon
concede
;
and
I
could
see
that
the
proposal
be
a
considerable
relief
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
come
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
"
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
the
dress
bell
;
but
I
will
not
go
yet
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
no
use
dressing
when
there
be
no
one
to
see
you
;
and
I
want
to
have
a
little
discourse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
drawing
-
room
be
certainly
an
impose
apartment
,
and
very
elegantly
furnish
;
but
I
see
its
young
mistress
glance
towards
me
as
we
enter
,
as
if
to
notice
how
I
be
impressed
by
the
spectacle
,
and
accordingly
I
determine
to
preserve
an
aspect
of
stony
indifference
,
as
if
I
see
nothing
at
all
remarkable
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
only
for
a
moment
:
 
<EOS>
immediately
conscience
whisper
,
"
why
should
I
disappoint
her
to
save
my
pride
?
 
<EOS>
no
 
rather
let
me
sacrifice
my
pride
to
give
her
a
little
innocent
gratification
.
<EOS>
"
and
I
honestly
look
round
,
and
tell
her
it
be
a
noble
room
,
and
very
tastefully
furnished
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
little
,
but
I
see
she
be
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
She
show
me
her
fat
french
poodle
,
that
lie
curl
up
on
a
silk
cushion
,
and
the
two
fine
italian
painting
:
 
<EOS>
which
,
however
,
she
would
not
give
me
time
to
examine
,
but
,
say
I
must
look
at
them
some
other
day
,
insist
upon
my
admire
the
little
jewelled
watch
she
have
purchase
in
Geneva
;
and
then
she
take
me
round
the
room
to
point
out
sundry
article
of
vertu
she
have
bring
from
Italy
:
 
an
elegant
little
timepiece
,
and
several
bust
,
small
graceful
figure
,
and
vase
,
<EOS>
all
beautifully
carve
in
white
marble
.
 
<EOS>
She
speak
of
these
with
animation
,
and
hear
my
admire
comment
with
a
smile
of
pleasure
:
 
that
soon
,
however
,
vanish
,
and
be
follow
by
a
melancholy
sigh
;
as
if
in
consideration
of
the
insufficiency
of
all
such
bauble
to
the
happiness
of
the
human
heart
,
and
their
woeful
inability
to
supply
its
insatiate
demand
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
stretch
herself
upon
a
couch
,
she
motion
me
to
a
capacious
easy
-
chair
that
stand
opposite
 
not
before
the
fire
,
but
before
a
wide
open
window
;
for
it
be
summer
,
be
it
remember
;
a
sweet
,
warm
evening
in
the
latter
half
of
June
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
for
a
moment
in
silence
,
enjoy
the
still
,
pure
air
,
and
the
delightful
prospect
of
the
park
that
lie
before
me
,
rich
in
verdure
and
foliage
,
and
bask
in
yellow
sunshine
,
relieve
by
the
long
shadow
of
decline
day
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
take
advantage
of
this
pause
:
I
have
inquiry
to
make
,
and
,
like
the
substance
of
a
lady
's
postscript
,
the
most
important
must
come
last
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
begin
with
ask
after
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Murray
,
and
Miss
Matilda
and
the
young
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
tell
that
papa
have
the
gout
,
which
make
him
very
ferocious
;
and
that
he
would
not
give
up
his
choice
wine
,
and
his
substantial
dinner
and
supper
,
and
have
quarrel
with
his
physician
,
because
the
latter
have
dare
to
say
that
no
medicine
could
cure
him
while
he
live
so
freely
;
that
mamma
and
the
rest
be
well
.
 
<EOS>
Matilda
be
still
wild
and
reckless
,
but
she
have
get
a
fashionable
governess
,
and
be
considerably
improve
in
her
manner
,
and
soon
to
be
introduce
to
the
world
;
and
John
and
Charles
(
now
at
home
for
the
holiday
)
be
,
by
all
account
,
"
fine
,
bold
,
unruly
,
mischievous
boy
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
how
be
the
other
people
get
on
?
"
say
I
"
the
Greens
,
for
instance
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Green
be
heart
-
break
,
you
know
,
"
reply
she
,
with
a
languid
smile
:
 
<EOS>
"
he
have
not
get
over
his
disappointment
yet
,
and
never
will
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
doom
to
be
an
old
bachelor
;
and
his
sister
be
do
their
good
to
get
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
the
Melthams
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
they
be
jog
on
as
usual
,
I
suppose
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
know
very
little
about
any
of
them
 
except
Harry
,
"
say
she
,
blush
slightly
,
and
smile
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
a
great
deal
of
him
while
we
be
in
London
;
for
,
as
soon
as
he
hear
we
be
there
,
he
come
up
under
pretence
of
visit
his
brother
,
and
either
follow
me
,
like
a
shadow
,
wherever
I
go
,
or
meet
me
,
like
a
reflection
,
at
every
turn
.
 
<EOS>
You
need
not
look
so
shocked
,
Miss
Grey
;
I
be
very
discreet
,
I
assure
you
,
but
,
you
know
,
one
can
not
help
be
admire
.
 
<EOS>
poor
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
my
only
worshipper
;
though
he
be
certainly
the
most
conspicuous
,
and
,
I
think
,
the
most
devoted
among
them
all

and
that
detestable
 
ahem
 
and
Sir
Thomas
choose
to
take
offence
at
him
 
or
my
profuse
expenditure
,
or
something
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
exactly
know
what
 
and
hurry
me
down
to
the
country
at
a
moment
's
notice
;
where
I
be
to
play
the
hermit
,
I
suppose
,
for
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
she
bite
her
lip
,
and
frown
vindictively
upon
the
fair
domain
she
have
once
so
coveted
to
call
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Hatfield
,
"
say
I
,
"
what
be
become
of
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
again
she
brighten
up
,
and
answer
gaily
"
oh
!
<EOS>
he
make
up
to
an
elderly
spinster
,
and
marry
her
,
not
long
since
;
weigh
her
heavy
purse
against
her
fade
charm
,
and
expect
to
find
that
solace
in
gold
which
be
deny
him
in
love
 
ha
,
ha
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
and
I
think
that
be
all
 
except
Mr.
Weston
:
 
<EOS>
what
be
he
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
I
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
go
from
Horton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
long
since
?
<EOS>
and
where
be
he
go
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
about
him
,
"
reply
she
,
<EOS>
yawn
"
except
that
he
go
about
a
month
ago
 
<EOS>
I
never
ask
where
"
(
I
would
have
ask
whether
it
be
to
a
living
or
merely
another
curacy
,
but
think
it
better
not
)
;
"
and
the
people
make
a
great
rout
about
his
leaving
,
"
continue
she
,
"
much
to
Mr.
Hatfield
's
displeasure
;
for
Hatfield
do
not
like
him
,
because
he
have
too
much
influence
with
the
common
people
,
and
because
he
be
not
sufficiently
tractable
and
submissive
to
him
 
and
for
some
other
unpardonable
sin
,
I
do
not
know
what
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
I
positively
must
go
and
dress
:
 
<EOS>
the
second
bell
will
ring
directly
,
and
if
I
come
to
dinner
in
this
guise
,
I
shall
never
hear
the
end
of
it
from
Lady
Ashby
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
strange
thing
one
can
not
be
mistress
in
one
's
own
house
!
 
<EOS>
just
ring
the
bell
,
and
I
will
send
for
my
maid
,
and
tell
them
to
get
you
some
tea
.
<EOS>
only
think
of
that
intolerable
woman
"
  
"
<EOS>
who
 
your
maid
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
 
my
mother
-
in
-
law
 
and
my
unfortunate
mistake
!
 
<EOS>
instead
of
let
her
take
herself
off
to
some
other
house
,
as
she
offer
to
do
when
I
marry
,
I
be
fool
enough
to
ask
her
to
live
here
still
,
and
direct
the
affair
of
the
house
for
me
;
because
,
in
the
first
place
,
I
hope
we
should
spend
the
great
part
of
the
year
,
in
town
,
and
in
the
second
place
,
be
so
young
and
inexperienced
,
I
be
frightened
at
the
idea
of
have
a
houseful
of
servant
to
manage
,
and
dinner
to
order
,
and
party
to
entertain
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
,
and
I
think
she
may
assist
me
with
her
experience
;
never
dream
she
would
prove
a
usurper
,
a
tyrant
,
an
incubus
,
a
spy
,
and
everything
else
that
be
detestable
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
she
be
dead
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
then
turn
to
give
her
order
to
the
footman
,
who
have
be
stand
bolt
upright
within
the
door
for
the
last
half
minute
,
and
have
hear
the
latter
part
of
her
animadversion
;
and
,
of
course
,
make
his
own
reflection
upon
them
,
notwithstanding
the
inflexible
,
wooden
countenance
he
think
proper
to
preserve
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
on
my
remarking
afterwards
that
he
must
have
hear
her
,
she
reply
"
oh
,
no
matter
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
care
about
the
footman
;
they
be
mere
automaton
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
nothing
to
them
what
their
superior
say
or
do
;
they
will
not
dare
to
repeat
it
;
and
as
to
what
they
think
 
if
they
presume
to
think
at
all
 
of
course
,
nobody
care
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
pretty
thing
indeed
<EOS>
,
it
we
be
to
be
tongue
-
tie
by
our
servant
!
"
  
<EOS>
so
say
,
she
run
off
to
make
her
hasty
toilet
,
leave
me
to
pilot
my
way
back
to
my
sitting
-
room
,
where
,
in
due
time
,
I
be
serve
with
a
cup
of
tea
.
 
<EOS>
after
that
,
I
sit
muse
on
Lady
Ashby
's
past
and
present
condition
;
and
on
what
little
information
I
have
obtain
respect
Mr.
Weston
,
and
the
small
chance
there
be
of
ever
see
or
hear
anything
more
of
him
throughout
my
quiet
,
drab
-
colour
life
:
 
which
,
henceforth
,
seem
to
offer
no
alternative
between
positive
rainy
day
,
and
day
of
dull
grey
cloud
without
downfall
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
I
begin
to
weary
of
my
thought
,
and
to
wish
I
know
where
to
find
the
library
my
hostess
have
speak
of
;
and
to
wonder
whether
I
be
to
remain
there
do
nothing
till
bed
-
time
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
be
not
rich
enough
to
possess
a
watch
,
I
could
not
tell
how
time
be
pass
,
except
by
observe
the
slowly
lengthen
shadow
from
the
window
;
which
present
a
side
view
,
include
a
corner
of
the
park
,
a
clump
of
tree
whose
topmost
branch
have
be
colonize
by
an
innumerable
company
of
noisy
rook
,
and
a
high
wall
with
a
massive
wooden
gate
:
 
no
doubt
communicate
with
the
stable
-
yard
,
as
a
broad
carriage
-
road
sweep
up
to
it
from
the
park
.
<EOS>
the
shadow
of
this
wall
soon
take
posession
of
the
whole
of
the
ground
as
far
as
I
could
see
,
force
the
golden
sunlight
to
retreat
inch
by
inch
,
and
at
last
take
refuge
in
the
very
top
of
the
tree
.
 
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
even
they
be
leave
in
shadow
 
the
shadow
of
the
distant
hill
,
or
of
the
earth
itself
;
and
,
in
sympathy
for
the
busy
citizen
of
the
rookery
,
I
regret
to
see
their
habitation
,
so
lately
bathe
in
glorious
light
,
reduce
to
the
sombre
,
work
-
a-
day
hue
of
the
low
world
,
or
of
my
own
world
within
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
moment
,
such
bird
as
soar
above
the
rest
may
still
receive
the
lustre
on
their
wing
,
which
impart
to
their
sable
plumage
the
hue
and
brilliance
of
deep
red
gold
;
at
last
,
that
too
depart
.
<EOS>
Twilight
come
steal
on
;
the
rook
become
more
quiet
;
I
become
more
weary
,
and
wish
I
be
go
home
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
it
grow
dark
;
and
I
be
think
of
ring
for
a
candle
,
and
betake
myself
to
bed
,
when
my
hostess
appear
,
with
many
apology
for
have
neglect
me
so
long
,
and
lay
all
the
blame
upon
that
"
nasty
old
woman
,
"
as
she
call
her
mother
-
in
-
law
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
do
not
sit
with
her
in
the
drawing
-
room
while
Sir
Thomas
be
take
his
wine
,
"
say
she
,
"
she
would
never
forgive
me
;
and
then
,
if
I
leave
the
room
the
instant
he
come
 
as
I
have
do
once
or
twice
 
it
be
an
unpardonable
offence
against
her
dear
Thomas
.
 
<EOS>
she
never
show
such
disrespect
to
HER
husband
:
 
and
as
for
affection
,
wife
never
think
of
that
now
-
a
-
day
<EOS>
,
she
suppose
:
 
but
thing
be
different
in
HER
time
 
as
if
there
be
any
good
to
be
do
by
stay
in
the
room
,
when
he
do
nothing
but
grumble
and
scold
when
he
be
in
a
bad
humour
,
talk
disgust
nonsense
when
he
be
in
a
good
one
,
and
go
to
sleep
on
the
sofa
when
he
be
too
stupid
for
either
;
which
be
most
frequently
the
case
now
,
when
he
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
sot
over
his
wine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
could
you
not
try
to
occupy
his
mind
with
something
well
;
and
engage
him
to
give
up
such
habit
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
have
power
of
persuasion
,
and
qualification
for
amuse
a
gentleman
,
which
many
lady
would
be
glad
to
possess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
you
think
I
would
lay
myself
out
for
his
amusement
!
 
<EOS>
no
:
that
be
not
my
idea
of
a
wife
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
husband
's
part
to
please
the
wife
,
not
her
to
please
him
;
and
if
he
be
not
satisfied
with
her
as
she
be
 
and
thankful
to
possess
her
too
 
<EOS>
he
be
not
worthy
of
her
,
that
be
all
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
for
persuasion
,
I
assure
you
I
shall
not
trouble
myself
with
that
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
enough
to
do
to
bear
with
him
as
he
be
,
without
attempt
to
work
a
reform
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
sorry
I
leave
you
so
long
alone
,
Miss
Grey
.
 
<EOS>
how
have
you
pass
the
time
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
chiefly
in
watch
the
rook
.
"
  
"
mercy
,
how
dull
you
must
have
be
!
 
<EOS>
I
really
must
show
you
the
library
;
and
you
must
ring
for
everything
you
want
,
just
as
you
would
in
an
inn
,
and
make
yourself
comfortable
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
selfish
reason
for
wish
to
make
you
happy
,
because
I
want
you
to
stay
with
me
,
and
not
fulfil
your
horrid
threat
of
run
away
in
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
do
not
let
me
keep
you
out
of
the
drawing
-
room
any
long
to
-
night
,
for
at
present
I
be
tired
and
wish
to
go
to
bed
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
PARK
  
<EOS>
I
come
down
a
little
before
eight
,
next
morning
,
as
I
know
by
the
striking
of
a
distant
clock
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
appearance
of
breakfast
.
<EOS>
I
wait
above
an
hour
before
it
come
,
still
vainly
long
for
access
to
the
library
;
and
,
after
that
lonely
repast
be
conclude
,
I
wait
again
about
an
hour
and
a
half
in
great
suspense
and
discomfort
,
uncertain
what
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
Lady
Ashby
come
to
bid
me
good
-
morning
.
 
<EOS>
She
inform
me
<EOS>
she
have
only
just
breakfast
,
and
now
want
me
to
take
an
early
walk
with
her
in
the
park
.
 
<EOS>
She
ask
how
long
I
have
be
up
,
and
on
receive
my
answer
,
express
the
deep
regret
,
and
again
promise
to
show
me
the
library
.
 
<EOS>
I
suggest
she
have
better
do
so
at
once
,
and
then
there
would
be
no
further
trouble
either
with
remember
or
forgetting
.
 
<EOS>
She
comply
,
on
condition
that
I
would
not
think
of
reading
,
or
bother
with
the
book
now
;
for
she
want
to
show
me
the
garden
,
and
take
a
walk
in
the
park
with
me
,
before
it
become
too
hot
for
enjoyment
;
which
,
indeed
,
be
nearly
the
case
already
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
I
readily
assent
;
and
we
take
our
walk
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
be
stroll
in
the
park
,
talk
of
what
my
companion
have
see
and
hear
during
her
travel
experience
,
a
gentleman
on
horseback
ride
up
and
pass
us
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
turn
,
in
passing
,
and
stare
me
full
in
the
face
,
I
have
a
good
opportunity
of
see
what
he
be
like
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
tall
,
thin
,
and
waste
,
with
a
slight
stoop
in
the
shoulder
,
a
pale
face
,
but
somewhat
blotchy
,
and
disagreeably
red
about
the
eyelid
,
plain
feature
,
and
a
general
appearance
of
languor
and
flatness
,
relieve
by
a
sinister
expression
in
the
mouth
and
the
dull
,
soulless
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
detest
that
man
!
"
<EOS>
whisper
Lady
Ashby
,
with
bitter
emphasis
,
as
he
slowly
trot
by
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
unwilling
to
suppose
that
she
should
so
speak
of
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Thomas
Ashby
,
"
she
reply
,
with
dreary
composure
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
you
detest
him
,
Miss
Murray
?
"
<EOS>
say
I
,
for
I
be
too
much
shocked
to
remember
her
name
at
the
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
do
,
Miss
Grey
,
and
despise
him
too
;
and
if
you
know
him
you
would
not
blame
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
know
what
he
be
before
you
marry
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
I
only
think
so
:
 
I
do
not
half
know
him
really
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
warn
me
against
it
,
and
I
wish
I
have
listen
to
you
:
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
too
late
to
regret
that
now
.
 
<EOS>
and
besides
,
mamma
ought
to
have
know
well
than
either
of
us
,
and
she
never
say
anything
against
it
 
quite
the
contrary
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
think
he
adore
me
,
and
would
let
me
have
my
own
way
:
 
he
do
pretend
to
do
so
at
first
,
but
now
he
do
not
care
a
bit
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
yet
I
should
not
care
for
that
:
he
may
do
as
he
please
,
if
I
may
only
be
free
to
amuse
myself
and
to
stay
in
London
,
or
have
a
few
friend
down
here
:
 
but
he
WILL
do
as
he
please
,
and
I
must
be
a
prisoner
and
a
slave
.
 
<EOS>
the
moment
he
see
I
could
enjoy
myself
without
him
,
and
that
other
know
my
value
better
than
himself
,
the
selfish
wretch
begin
to
accuse
me
of
coquetry
and
extravagance
;
and
to
abuse
Harry
Meltham
,
whose
shoe
he
be
not
worthy
to
clean
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
must
needs
have
me
down
in
the
country
,
to
lead
the
life
of
a
nun
,
lest
I
should
dishonour
him
or
bring
him
to
ruin
;
as
if
he
have
not
be
ten
time
bad
every
way
,
with
his
betting
-
book
,
and
his
gaming
-
table
,
and
his
opera
-
girl
,
and
his
Lady
This
and
Mrs.
<EOS>
that
 
yes
,
and
his
bottle
of
wine
,
and
glass
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
too
!
 
<EOS>
oh
,
I
would
give
ten
thousand
world
to
be
Mss
Murray
again
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
too
bad
to
feel
life
,
health
,
and
beauty
waste
away
,
unfelt
and
unenjoyed
,
for
such
a
brute
as
that
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
she
,
fairly
burst
into
tear
in
the
bitterness
of
her
vexation
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
,
I
pity
her
exceedingly
;
as
well
for
her
false
idea
of
happiness
and
disregard
of
duty
,
as
for
the
wretched
partner
with
whom
her
fate
be
link
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
what
I
could
to
comfort
her
,
and
offer
such
counsel
as
I
think
she
most
require
:
 
advise
her
,
first
,
by
gentle
reasoning
,
by
kindness
,
example
,
and
persuasion
,
to
try
to
ameliorate
her
husband
;
and
then
,
when
she
have
do
all
she
could
,
if
she
still
find
him
incorrigible
,
to
endeavour
to
abstract
herself
from
him
 
to
wrap
herself
up
in
her
own
integrity
,
and
trouble
herself
as
little
about
him
as
possible
.
<EOS>
I
exhort
her
to
seek
consolation
in
do
her
duty
to
God
and
man
,
to
put
her
trust
in
Heaven
,
and
solace
herself
with
the
care
and
nurture
of
her
little
daughter
;
assure
her
she
would
be
amply
reward
by
witness
its
progress
in
strength
and
wisdom
,
and
receive
its
genuine
affection
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
can
not
devote
myself
entirely
to
a
child
,
"
say
she
;
"
it
may
die
 
which
be
not
at
all
improbable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
with
care
,
many
a
delicate
infant
have
become
a
strong
man
or
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
it
may
grow
so
intolerably
like
its
father
that
I
shall
hate
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
not
likely
;
it
be
a
little
girl
,
and
strongly
resemble
its
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
matter
;
I
should
like
it
better
if
it
be
a
boy
 
only
that
its
father
will
leave
it
no
inheritance
that
he
can
possibly
squander
away
.
 
<EOS>
what
pleasure
can
I
have
in
see
a
girl
grow
up
to
eclipse
me
,
and
enjoy
those
pleasure
that
I
be
for
ever
debar
from
?
<EOS>
but
suppose
I
could
be
so
generous
as
to
take
delight
in
this
,
still
it
be
only
a
child
;
and
I
can
not
centre
all
my
hope
in
a
child
:
 
<EOS>
that
be
only
one
degree
well
than
devote
oneself
to
a
dog
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
for
all
the
wisdom
and
goodness
you
have
be
try
to
instil
into
me
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
very
right
and
proper
,
I
daresay
,
and
if
I
be
some
twenty
year
old
,
I
may
fructify
by
it
:
 
but
people
must
enjoy
themselves
when
they
be
young
;
and
if
other
will
not
let
them
 
why
,
they
must
hate
them
for
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
good
way
to
enjoy
yourself
be
to
do
what
be
right
and
hate
nobody
.
 
<EOS>
the
end
of
religion
be
not
to
teach
us
how
to
die
,
but
how
to
live
;
and
the
earlier
you
become
wise
and
good
,
the
more
of
happiness
you
secure
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
,
Lady
Ashby
,
I
have
one
more
piece
of
advice
to
offer
you
,
which
be
,
that
you
will
not
make
an
enemy
of
your
mother
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
get
into
the
way
of
hold
her
at
arm
"
length
,
and
regard
her
with
jealous
distrust
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
her
,
but
I
have
hear
good
as
well
as
evil
respect
her
;
and
I
imagine
that
,
though
cold
and
haughty
in
her
general
demeanour
,
and
even
exact
in
her
requirement
,
she
have
strong
affection
for
those
who
can
reach
them
;
and
,
though
so
blindly
attach
to
her
son
,
she
be
not
without
good
principle
,
or
incapable
of
hear
reason
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
would
but
conciliate
her
a
little
,
and
adopt
a
friendly
,
open
manner
 
and
even
confide
your
grievance
to
her
 
real
grievance
,
such
as
you
have
a
right
to
complain
of
 
<EOS>
it
be
my
firm
belief
that
she
would
,
in
time
,
become
your
faithful
friend
,
and
a
comfort
and
support
to
you
,
instead
of
the
incubus
you
describe
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
I
fear
my
advice
have
little
effect
upon
the
unfortunate
young
lady
;
and
,
find
I
could
render
myself
so
little
serviceable
,
my
residence
at
Ashby
Park
become
doubly
painful
.
 
<EOS>
but
still
,
I
must
stay
out
that
day
and
the
follow
one
,
as
I
have
promise
to
do
so
:
 
though
,
resist
all
entreaty
and
inducement
to
prolong
my
visit
further
<EOS>
,
I
insist
upon
depart
the
next
morning
;
affirm
that
my
mother
would
be
lonely
without
me
,
and
that
she
impatiently
expect
my
return
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
it
be
with
a
heavy
heart
that
I
bade
adieu
to
poor
Lady
Ashby
,
and
leave
her
in
her
princely
home
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
slight
additional
proof
of
her
unhappiness
,
that
she
should
so
cling
to
the
consolation
of
my
presence
,
and
earnestly
desire
the
company
of
one
<EOS>
whose
general
taste
and
idea
be
so
little
congenial
to
her
own
 
<EOS>
whom
she
have
completely
forget
in
her
hour
of
prosperity
,
and
whose
presence
would
be
rather
a
nuisance
than
a
pleasure
,
if
she
could
but
have
half
her
heart
's
desire
.
    
<EOS>
the
SANDS
  
<EOS>
Our
school
be
not
situate
in
the
heart
of
the
town
:
 
on
enter
a
#
#
#
#
from
the
north
-
west
there
be
a
row
of
respectable
-
look
house
,
on
each
side
of
the
broad
,
white
road
,
with
narrow
slip
of
garden
-
ground
before
them
,
venetian
blind
to
the
window
,
and
a
flight
of
step
lead
to
each
trim
,
brass
-
handle
door
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
of
the
large
of
these
habitation
dwelt
my
mother
and
I
,
with
such
young
lady
as
our
friend
and
the
public
choose
to
commit
to
our
charge
.
 
<EOS>
consequently
,
we
be
a
considerable
distance
from
the
sea
,
and
divide
from
it
by
a
labyrinth
of
street
and
house
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
sea
be
my
delight
;
and
I
would
often
gladly
pierce
the
town
to
obtain
the
pleasure
of
a
walk
beside
it
,
whether
with
the
pupil
,
or
alone
with
my
mother
during
the
vacation
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
delightful
to
me
at
all
time
and
season
,
but
especially
in
the
wild
commotion
of
a
rough
sea
-
breeze
,
and
in
the
brilliant
freshness
of
a
summer
morning
.
  
<EOS>
I
awake
early
on
the
third
morning
after
my
return
from
Ashby
Park
 
<EOS>
the
sun
be
shine
through
the
blind
,
and
I
think
how
pleasant
it
would
be
to
pass
through
the
quiet
town
and
take
a
solitary
ramble
on
the
sand
while
half
the
world
be
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
long
in
form
the
resolution
,
nor
slow
to
act
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
I
would
not
disturb
my
mother
,
so
I
steal
noiselessly
downstairs
,
and
quietly
unfasten
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
dressed
and
out
,
when
the
church
clock
strike
a
quarter
to
six
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
feeling
of
freshness
and
vigour
in
the
very
street
;
and
when
I
get
free
of
the
town
,
when
my
foot
be
on
the
sand
and
my
face
towards
the
broad
,
bright
bay
,
no
language
can
describe
the
effect
of
the
deep
,
clear
azure
of
the
sky
and
ocean
,
the
bright
morning
sunshine
on
the
semicircular
barrier
of
craggy
cliff
surmount
by
green
swelling
hill
,
and
on
the
smooth
,
wide
sand
,
and
the
low
rock
out
at
sea
 
look
,
with
their
clothing
of
weed
and
mos
,
like
little
grass
-
grow
island
 
and
above
all
,
on
the
brilliant
,
sparkle
wave
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
the
unspeakable
purity
 
and
freshness
of
the
air
!
 
<EOS>
there
be
just
enough
heat
to
enhance
the
value
of
the
breeze
,
and
just
enough
wind
to
keep
the
whole
sea
in
motion
,
to
make
the
wave
come
bound
to
the
shore
,
foam
and
sparkling
,
as
if
wild
with
glee
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
else
be
stir
 
no
live
creature
be
visible
besides
myself
.
 
<EOS>
My
footstep
be
the
first
to
press
the
firm
,
unbroken
sand
;
 
nothing
before
have
trample
them
since
last
night
's
flow
tide
have
obliterate
the
deep
mark
of
yesterday
,
and
leave
them
fair
and
even
,
except
where
the
subsiding
water
have
leave
behind
it
the
trace
of
dimpled
pool
and
little
running
stream
.
  
<EOS>
Refreshed
,
delighted
,
invigorate
,
I
walk
along
,
forget
all
my
care
,
feel
as
if
I
have
wing
to
my
foot
,
and
could
go
at
least
forty
mile
without
fatigue
,
and
experience
a
sense
of
exhilaration
to
which
I
have
be
an
entire
stranger
since
the
day
of
early
youth
.
 
<EOS>
about
half
-
past
six
,
however
,
the
groom
begin
to
come
down
to
air
their
master
'
horse
 
first
one
,
and
then
another
,
till
there
be
some
dozen
horse
and
five
or
six
rider
:
but
that
need
not
trouble
me
,
for
they
would
not
come
as
far
as
the
low
rock
which
I
be
now
approach
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
reach
these
,
and
walk
over
the
moist
,
slippery
sea
-
weed
(
<EOS>
at
the
risk
of
flounder
into
one
of
the
numerous
pool
of
clear
,
salt
water
that
lie
between
them
)
,
to
a
little
mossy
promontory
with
the
sea
splashing
round
it
,
I
look
back
again
to
see
who
next
be
stirring
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
there
be
only
the
early
groom
with
their
horse
,
and
one
gentleman
with
a
little
dark
speck
of
a
dog
run
before
him
,
and
one
water
-
cart
come
out
of
the
town
to
get
water
for
the
bath
.
 
<EOS>
in
another
minute
or
two
,
the
distant
bathing
machine
would
begin
to
move
,
and
then
the
elderly
gentleman
of
regular
habit
and
sober
quaker
lady
would
be
come
to
take
their
salutary
morning
walk
.
 
<EOS>
but
however
interesting
such
a
scene
may
be
,
I
could
not
wait
to
witness
it
,
for
the
sun
and
the
sea
<EOS>
so
dazzle
my
eye
in
that
direction
,
that
I
could
but
afford
one
glance
;
and
then
I
turn
again
to
delight
myself
with
the
sight
and
the
sound
of
the
sea
,
dash
against
my
promontory
 
with
no
prodigious
force
,
for
the
swell
be
break
by
the
tangled
sea
-
weed
and
the
unseen
rock
beneath
;
otherwise
I
should
soon
have
be
deluge
with
spray
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
tide
be
come
in
;
the
water
be
rise
;
the
gulf
and
lake
be
fill
;
the
strait
be
widen
:
 
it
be
time
to
seek
some
safe
footing
;
so
I
walk
,
skip
,
and
stumble
back
to
the
smooth
,
wide
sand
,
and
resolve
to
proceed
to
a
certain
bold
projection
in
the
cliff
,
and
then
return
.
  
<EOS>
presently
,
I
hear
a
snuffling
sound
behind
me
and
then
a
dog
come
frisk
and
wriggle
to
my
foot
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
<EOS>
my
own
Snap
 
<EOS>
the
little
dark
,
wire
-
haired
terrier
!
 
<EOS>
when
I
speak
his
name
,
he
leap
up
in
my
face
and
yell
for
joy
.
 
<EOS>
almost
as
much
delighted
as
himself
,
I
catch
the
little
creature
in
my
arm
,
and
kiss
him
repeatedly
.
<EOS>
but
how
come
he
to
be
there
?
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
drop
from
the
sky
,
or
come
all
that
way
alone
:
 
<EOS>
it
must
be
either
his
master
,
the
rat
-
catcher
,
or
somebody
else
that
have
bring
him
;
so
,
repress
my
extravagant
caress
,
and
endeavour
to
repress
his
likewise
,
I
look
round
,
and
beheld
 
Mr.
Weston
!
  
<EOS>
"
Your
dog
remember
you
well
,
Miss
Grey
,
"
say
he
,
warmly
grasp
the
hand
<EOS>
I
offer
him
without
clearly
know
what
I
be
about
.
<EOS>
"
You
rise
early
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
often
so
early
as
this
,
"
I
reply
,
with
amazing
composure
,
consider
all
the
circumstance
of
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
far
do
you
purpose
to
extend
your
walk
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
think
of
return
 
<EOS>
it
must
be
almost
time
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
consult
his
watch
 
a
gold
one
now
 
and
tell
me
it
be
only
five
minute
past
seven
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
doubtless
,
you
have
have
a
long
enough
walk
,
"
say
he
,
turn
towards
the
town
,
to
which
I
now
proceed
leisurely
to
retrace
my
step
;
and
he
walk
beside
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
what
part
of
the
town
do
you
live
?
"
ask
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
could
discover
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
never
could
discover
?
 
<EOS>
have
he
endeavour
to
do
so
then
?
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
the
place
of
our
abode
.
 
<EOS>
He
ask
how
we
prosper
in
our
affair
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
we
be
do
very
well
 
that
we
have
have
a
considerable
addition
to
our
pupil
after
the
Christmas
vacation
,
and
expect
a
still
further
increase
at
the
close
of
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
an
accomplished
instructor
,
"
he
observe
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
it
be
my
mother
,
"
<EOS>
I
reply
;
"
she
manage
thing
so
well
,
and
be
so
active
,
and
clever
,
and
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
know
your
mother

<EOS>
Will
you
introduce
me
to
her
some
time
,
if
I
call
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
willingly
.
"
  
"
and
will
you
allow
me
the
privilege
of
an
old
friend
,
of
look
in
upon
you
now
and
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
if
 
I
suppose
so
.
"
  
this
be
a
very
foolish
answer
,
but
the
truth
be
,
I
consider
that
I
have
no
right
to
invite
anyone
to
my
mother
's
house
without
her
knowledge
;
and
if
I
have
say
,
"
yes
,
if
my
mother
do
not
object
,
"
it
would
appear
as
if
by
his
question
I
understand
more
than
be
expect
;
so
,
SUPPOSING
she
would
not
,
I
add
,
"
I
suppose
so
:
<EOS>
"
but
of
course
I
should
have
say
something
more
sensible
and
more
polite
,
if
I
have
have
my
wit

We
continue
our
walk
for
a
minute
in
silence

which

no

relief
to

by
Mr.

comment
upon
the
brightness
of

the
beauty
of
the
bay

upon
the
advantage

"
no

say
I
;

we
live
so
completely
out
of

even
here

that
news
seldom
reach
me
through
any

through

I
may
congratulate
you
on
the
acquisition

<EOS>

I
expect
to
like
my
parish
better
a
year

two
hence

when
I
have
work
certain
reform
I
have
set
my
heart
upon
 
or
,
at

,
progress
some
step
towards
such
an
achievement

<EOS>
but
you
may
congratulate
me
now
;
for
I
find
it
very
agreeable
to
have
a
parish
all
to
myself
,
with
nobody
to
interfere
with
me
 
to
thwart
my
plan
or
cripple
my
exertion
:
 
and
besides
,
I
have
a
respectable
house
in
a
rather
pleasant
neighbourhood
,
and
three
hundred
pound
a
year
;
and
,
in
fact
,
I
have
nothing
but
solitude
to
complain
of
,
and
nothing
but
a
companion
to
wish
for
.

He
look
at
me
as
he
conclude
:

the
flash
of
his
dark
eye
seem
to
set
my
face
on
fire
;
greatly
to
my
own
discomfiture
,
for
to
evince
confusion
at
such
a
juncture
be
intolerable
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
an
effort
,
therefore
,
to
remedy
the
evil
,
and
disclaim
all
personal
application
of
the
remark
by
a
hasty

ill
-
express
reply
,
to
the
effect
that
,
if
he
wait
till
he
be
well
know

he
may
have
numerous
opportunity
for
supply
his

ample

not
consider
the
compliment
imply
by
such
an
assertion

his
answer
make
me
aware

it

I
be
not
so
presumptuous
as
to
believe
that

he

though
you
tell
it
me
;

if
it
be
so

I
be
rather
particular
in
my

<EOS>
here
the
conversation
be
interrupt
by
a
water

cart
lumber
past
us

for
we
be
now
come
to
the
busy
part

eight

ten

between

there
be
little

our
back

ascend
the
precipitous

my

walk
there
many

both
morning

I
have
look
about

tacitly
inform

enter

through

CONCLUSION
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Agnes
,
you
must
not
take
such
long
walk
again
before
breakfast
,
"
say
my
mother
,
observe
that
I
drink
an
extra
cup
of
coffee
and
eat
nothing
 
plead
the
heat
of
the
weather
,
and
the
fatigue
of
my
long
walk
as
an
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
I
certainly
do
feel
feverish
and
tired
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
always
do
thing
by
extreme
:
 
now
,
if
you
have
take
a
short
walk
every
morning
,
and
would
continue
to
do
so
,
it
would
do
you
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
mamma
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
this
be
bad
than
lie
in
bed
or
bend
over
your
book
:
you
have
quite
put
yourself
into
a
fever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
do
it
again
,
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
I
be
rack
my
brain
with
think
how
to
tell
her
about
Mr.
Weston
,
for
she
must
know
he
be
come
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
wait
till
the
breakfast
thing
be
remove
,
and
I
be
more
calm
and
cool
;
and
then
,
have
sit
down
to
my
drawing
<EOS>
,
I
begin
"
I
meet
an
old
friend
on
the
sand
to
-
day
,
mamma
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
an
old
friend
!
 
<EOS>
who
could
it
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
two
old
friend
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
one
be
a
dog
;
"
and
then
I
remind
her
of
Snap
,
whose
history
I
have
recount
before
,
and
relate
the
incident
of
his
sudden
appearance
and
remarkable
recognition
;
"
and
the
other
,
"
continue
I
,
"
be
Mr.
Weston
,
the
curate
of
Horton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Weston
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
hear
of
him
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
you
have
:
 
I
have
mention
him
several
time
,
I
believe
:
 
<EOS>
but
you
do
not
remember
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
you
speak
of
Mr.
Hatfield
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Hatfield
be
the
rector
,
and
Mr.
Weston
the
curate
:
 
I
use
to
mention
him
sometimes
in
contradistinction
to
Mr.
Hatfield
,
as
be
a
more
efficient
clergyman
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
be
on
the
sand
this
morning
with
the
dog
 
<EOS>
he
have
buy
it
,
I
suppose
,
from
the
rat
-
catcher
;
and
he
know
me
as
well
as
it
do
 
probably
through
its
mean
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
a
little
conversation
with
him
,
in
the
course
of
which
,
as
he
ask
about
our
school
,
I
be
lead
to
say
something
about
you
,
and
your
good
management
;
and
he
say
he
should
like
to
know
you
,
and
ask
if
I
would
introduce
him
to
you
,
if
he
should
take
the
liberty
of
call
to
-
morrow
;
so
I
say
I
would
.
 
<EOS>
be
I
right
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
what
kind
of
a
man
be
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
very
respectable
man
,
I
think
:
 
<EOS>
but
you
will
see
him
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
new
vicar
of
F
#
#
#
#
,
and
as
he
have
only
be
there
a
few
week
,
I
suppose
he
have
make
no
friend
yet
,
and
want
a
little
society
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
morrow
come
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
fever
of
anxiety
and
expectation
<EOS>
I
be
in
from
breakfast
till
noon
 
at
which
time
he
make
his
appearance
!
<EOS>
have
introduce
him
to
my
mother
,
I
take
my
work
to
the
window
,
and
sit
down
to
await
the
result
of
the
interview
.
 
<EOS>
They
get
on
extremely
well
together
 
greatly
to
my
satisfaction
,
for
I
have
feel
very
anxious
about
what
my
mother
would
think
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
stay
long
that
time
:
 
but
when
he
rise
to
take
leave
,
she
say
she
should
be
happy
to
see
him
,
whenever
he
may
find
it
convenient
to
call
again
;
and
when
he
be
go
,
I
be
gratify
by
hear
her
say
,
 
"
<EOS>
well
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
he
be
a
very
sensible
man
.
 
<EOS>
but
why
do
you
sit
back
there
,
Agnes
,
"
she
add
,
"
and
talk
so
little
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
you
talk
so
well
,
mamma
,
I
think
you
require
no
assistance
from
me
:
 
and
,
<EOS>
besides
,
he
be
your
visitor
,
not
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
after
that
,
he
often
call
upon
us
 
several
time
in
the
course
of
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
He
generally
address
most
of
his
conversation
to
my
mother
:
 
and
no
wonder
,
for
she
could
converse
.
 
<EOS>
I
almost
envy
the
unfettered
,
vigorous
fluency
of
her
discourse
,
and
the
strong
sense
evince
by
everything
she
say
 
and
<EOS>
yet
,
I
do
not
;
for
,
though
I
occasionally
regret
my
own
deficiency
for
his
sake
,
it
give
me
very
great
pleasure
to
sit
and
hear
the
two
being
I
love
and
honour
above
every
one
else
in
the
world
,
discourse
together
so
amicably
,
so
wisely
,
and
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
always
silent
,
however
;
nor
be
I
at
all
neglect
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
quite
as
much
notice
as
I
would
wish
to
be
:
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
lack
of
kind
word
and
kind
look
,
no
end
of
delicate
attention
,
too
fine
and
subtle
to
be
grasp
by
word
,
and
therefore
indescribable
 
but
deeply
feel
at
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Ceremony
be
quickly
drop
between
us
:
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
come
as
an
expect
guest
,
welcome
at
all
time
,
and
never
derange
the
economy
of
our
household
affair
.
 
<EOS>
He
even
call
me
"
agne
:
"
the
name
have
be
timidly
speak
at
first
,
but
,
find
it
give
no
offence
in
any
quarter
,
he
seem
greatly
to
prefer
that
appellation
to
"
Miss
Grey
;
"
and
so
do
I.
 
how
tedious
and
gloomy
be
those
day
in
which
he
do
not
come
!
 
<EOS>
and
yet
not
miserable
;
for
I
have
still
the
remembrance
of
the
last
visit
and
the
hope
of
the
next
to
cheer
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
two
or
three
day
pass
without
my
see
him
,
I
certainly
feel
very
anxious
 
absurdly
,
unreasonably
so
;
for
,
of
course
,
he
have
his
own
business
and
the
affair
of
his
parish
to
attend
to
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
dread
the
close
of
the
holiday
,
when
my
business
also
would
begin
,
and
I
should
be
sometimes
unable
to
see
him
,
and
sometimes
 
when
my
mother
be
in
the
schoolroom
 
oblige
to
be
with
him
alone
:
 
a
position
I
do
not
at
all
desire
,
in
the
house
;
though
to
meet
him
out
of
door
,
and
walk
beside
him
,
have
prove
by
no
means
disagreeable
.
  
<EOS>
one
evening
,
however
,
in
the
last
week
of
the
vacation
,
he
arrive
 
unexpectedly
:
 
for
a
heavy
and
protracted
thunder
-
shower
during
the
afternoon
have
almost
destroy
my
hope
of
see
him
that
day
;
but
now
the
storm
be
over
,
and
the
sun
be
shine
brightly
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
beautiful
evening
,
Mrs.
Grey
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
as
he
enter
.
 
<EOS>
"
agne

I
want
you
to
take
a
walk
with
me

<EOS>
I
go
to
get
ready
,

be
down
again
in
a
few
minute
;
though
,
of
course
,
I
take
a
little
more
pain
with
my
attire

if
I
have
merely
be
go
out
on
some
shopping

<EOS>
the
thunder
-
shower
have
certainly
have
a
most
beneficial
effect
upon
the
weather
,
and
the
evening
be

delightful

<EOS>
Mr.
Weston
would
have
me
to
take
his
arm
;
he
say
little
during
our
passage
through
the
crowded
street
,
but
walk
very
fast
,
and
appear
grave
and
abstract
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
be
the
matter
,
and
feel
an
indefinite
dread
that
something
unpleasant
be
on
his
mind
;
and
vague
surmise
,
concern
what
it
may
be
,
trouble
me
not
a
little
,
and
make
me
grave
and
silent
enough
.
 
<EOS>
but
these
fantasy
vanish
upon
reach
the
quiet
outskirt
of
the
town
;
<EOS>
for
as
soon
as
we
come
within
sight
of
the
venerable
old
church
,
and
the
 
hill
,
with
the
deep
blue
beyond
it
,
I
find
my
companion
be
cheerful
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
I
have
be
walk
too
fast
for
you
,
Agnes
,
"
say
he
:
"
in
my
impatience
to
be
rid
of
the
town
,
I
forget
to
consult
your
convenience
;
but
now
we
will
walk
as
slowly
as
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
,
by
those
light
cloud
in
the
west
,
there
will
be
a
brilliant
sunset
,
and
we
shall
be
in
time
to
witness
its
effect
upon
the
sea
,
at
the
most
moderate
rate
of
progression
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
we
have
get
about
half
-
way
up
the
hill
,
we
fall
into
silence
again
;
which
,
as
usual
,
he
be
the
first
to
break
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
house
be
desolate
yet
,
Miss
Grey
,
"
he
smilingly
observe
,
"
and
I
be
acquaint
now
with
all
the
lady
in
my
parish
,
and
several
in
this
town
too
;
and
many
other
I
know
by
sight
and
by
report
;
but
not
one
of
them
will
suit
me
for
a
companion
;
in
fact
,
there
be
only
one
person
in
the
world
that
will
:
 
and
that
be
yourself
;
and
I
want
to
know
your
decision
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
in
earnest
,
Mr.
Weston
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
in
earnest
!
 
<EOS>
how
could
you
think
I
should
jest
on
such
a
subject
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
lay
his
hand
on
mine
,
that
rest
on
his
arm
:
 
<EOS>
he
must
have
feel
it
tremble
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
no
great
matter
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
have
not
be
too
precipitate
,
"
he
say
,
in
a
serious
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
know
that
it
be
not
my
way
to
flatter
and
talk
soft
nonsense
,
or
even
to
speak
the
admiration
that
I
feel
;
and
that
a
single
word
or
glance
of
mine
mean
more
than
the
honied
phrase
and
fervent
protestation
of
most
other
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
say
something
about
not
like
to
leave
my
mother
,
and
do
nothing
without
her
consent
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
settle
everything
with
Mrs.
Grey
,
while
you
be
put
on
your
bonnet
,
"
reply
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
say
I
may
have
her
consent
,
if
I
could
obtain
yours
;
and
I
ask
her
,
in
case
I
should
be
so
happy
,
to
come
and
live
with
us
 
<EOS>
for
I
be
sure
you
would
like
it
better
.
<EOS>
but
she
refuse
,
say
she
could
now
afford
to
employ
an
assistant
,
and
would
continue
the
school
till
she
could
purchase
an
annuity
sufficient
to
maintain
her
in
comfortable
lodging
;
and
,
meantime
,
she
would
spend
her
vacation
alternately
with
us
and
your
sister
,
and
should
be
quite
contented
if
you
be
happy
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
now
I
have
overrule
your
objection
on
her
account
.
 
<EOS>
have
you
any
other
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
 
none
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
love
me
then
?
<EOS>
"
say
be
,
fervently
press
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
I
pause
.
 
<EOS>
My
Diary
,
from
which
I
have
compile
these
page
,
go
but
little
further
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
go
on
for
year
,
but
I
will
content
myself
with
add
,
that
I
shall
never
forget
that
glorious
summer
evening
,
and
always
remember
with
delight
that
steep
hill
,
and
the
edge
of
the
precipice
where
we
stand
together
,
watch
the
splendid
sunset
mirror
in
the
restless
world
of
water
at
our
foot
 
with
heart
fill
with
gratitude
to
heaven
,
and
happiness
,
and
love
 
almost
too
full
for
speech
.
  
<EOS>
a
few
week
after
that
,
when
my
mother
have
supply
herself
with
an
assistant
,
I
become
the
wife
of
Edward
Weston
;
and
never
have
find
cause
to
repent
it
,
and
be
certain
that
I
never
shall
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
have
trial
,
and
we
know
that
we
must
have
them
again
;
but
we
bear
them
well
together
,
and
endeavour
to
fortify
ourselves
and
each
other
against
the
final
separation
 
that
great
of
all
affliction
to
the
survivor
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
if
we
keep
in
mind
the
glorious
heaven
beyond
,
where
both
may
meet
again
,
and
sin
and
sorrow
be
unknown
,
surely
that
too
may
be
bear
;
and
,
meantime
,
we
endeavour
to
live
to
the
glory
of
Him
who
have
scatter
so
many
blessing
in
our
path
.
  
<EOS>
Edward
,
by
his
strenuous
exertion
,
have
work
surprising
reform
in
his
parish
,
and
be
esteem
and
love
by
its
inhabitant
 
as
he
deserve
;
for
whatever
his
fault
may
be
as
a
man
(
and
no
one
be
entirely
without
)
,
I
defy
anybody
to
blame
him
as
a
pastor
,
a
husband
,
or
a
father
.
  
<EOS>
Our
child
,
Edward
,
Agnes
,
and
little
Mary
,
promise
well
;
their
education
,
for
the
time
being
,
be
chiefly
committed
to
me
;
and
they
shall
want
no
good
thing
that
a
mother
's
care
can
give
.
 
<EOS>
Our
modest
income
be
amply
sufficient
for
our
requirement
:
 
and
by
practise
the
economy
we
learn
in
hard
time
,
and
never
attempt
to
imitate
our
rich
neighbour
,
we
manage
not
only
to
enjoy
comfort
and
contentment
ourselves
,
but
to
have
every
year
something
to
lay
by
for
our
child
,
and
something
to
give
to
those
who
need
it
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
I
think
I
have
say
sufficient
.
