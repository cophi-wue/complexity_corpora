<EOS>
the
solitude
of
the
Hartz
forest
in
Germany
,
but
especially
the
mountain
call
Blockberg
,
or
rather
Blockenberg
,
be
the
choose
scene
for
tale
of
witch
,
demon
,
and
apparition
.
<EOS>
the
occupation
of
the
inhabitant
,
who
be
either
miner
or
forester
,
be
of
a
kind
that
render
them
peculiarly
prone
to
superstition
,
and
the
natural
phenomenon
which
they
witness
in
pursuit
of
their
solitary
or
subterraneous
profession
,
be
often
set
down
by
them
to
the
interference
of
goblin
or
the
power
of
magic
.
<EOS>
among
the
various
legend
current
in
that
wild
country
,
there
be
a
favourite
one
which
suppose
the
Hartz
to
be
haunt
by
a
sort
of
tutelar
demon
,
in
the
shape
of
a
wild
man
,
of
huge
stature
,
his
head
wreathe
with
oak
leave
,
and
his
middle
tincture
with
the
same
,
bear
in
his
hand
a
pine
tear
up
by
the
root
.
<EOS>
It
be
certain
that
many
person
profess
to
have
see
such
a
man
traverse
,
with
huge
stride
,
the
opposite
ridge
of
a
mountain
,
when
divide
from
it
by
a
narrow
glen
;
and
indeed
the
fact
of
the
apparition
be
so
generally
admit
,
that
modern
scepticism
have
only
find
refuge
by
ascribe
it
to
optical
deception
.
 
<EOS>
in
eld
time
,
the
intercourse
of
the
demon
with
the
inhabitant
be
more
familiar
,
and
,
accord
to
the
tradition
of
the
Hartz
,
he
be
will
not
,
with
the
caprice
usually
ascribe
to
these
earth
--
bear
power
to
interfere
with
the
affair
of
mortal
,
sometimes
for
their
welfare
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
observe
,
that
even
his
gift
often
turn
out
,
in
the
long
run
,
fatal
to
those
on
whom
they
be
bestow
,
and
it
be
no
uncommon
thing
for
the
pastor
,
in
their
care
for
their
flock
,
to
compose
long
sermon
<EOS>
the
burthen
whereof
be
a
warning
against
have
any
intercourse
,
direct
or
indirect
,
with
the
Hartz
demon
.
<EOS>
the
fortune
of
Martin
Waldeck
have
be
often
quote
by
the
age
to
their
giddy
child
,
when
they
be
hear
to
scoff
at
a
danger
which
appear
visionary
.
 
<EOS>
a
travel
capuchin
have
possess
himself
of
the
pulpit
of
the
thatched
church
at
a
little
hamlet
call
Morgenbrodt
,
lie
in
the
Hartz
district
,
from
which
he
declaim
against
the
wickedness
of
the
inhabitant
,
their
communication
with
fiend
,
witch
,
and
fairy
,
and
particularly
with
the
woodland
goblin
of
the
Hartz
.
<EOS>
the
doctrine
of
Luther
have
already
begin
to
spread
among
the
peasantry
,
for
the
incident
be
place
under
the
reign
of
Charles
V
,
and
they
laugh
to
scorn
the
zeal
with
which
the
venerable
man
insist
upon
his
topic
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
as
his
vehemence
increase
with
opposition
,
so
their
opposition
rise
in
proportion
to
his
vehemence
.
<EOS>
the
inhabitant
do
not
like
to
hear
an
accustomed
demon
,
who
have
inhabit
the
Brockenberg
for
so
many
age
,
summarily
confound
with
Baal
--
peor
,
Ashtaroth
,
and
Beelzebub
himself
,
and
condemn
without
reprieve
to
the
bottomless
Tophet
.
<EOS>
the
apprehension
that
the
spirit
may
avenge
himself
on
them
for
listen
to
such
an
illiberal
sentence
,
add
to
the
national
interest
in
his
behalf
.
<EOS>
a
travel
friar
,
they
say
,
that
be
here
today
and
away
tomorrow
,
may
say
what
he
please
,
but
it
be
we
the
ancient
and
constant
inhabitant
of
the
country
,
that
be
leave
at
the
mercy
of
the
insulted
demon
,
and
must
,
of
course
,
pay
for
all
.
<EOS>
under
the
irritation
occasion
by
these
reflection
the
peasant
from
injurious
language
betook
themselves
to
stone
,
and
have
pebble
the
priest
most
handsomely
,
they
drive
him
out
of
the
parish
to
preach
against
demon
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
three
young
man
,
who
have
be
present
and
assist
in
the
attack
upon
the
priest
,
carry
on
the
laborious
and
mean
occupation
of
prepare
charcoal
for
the
smelting
furnace
.
<EOS>
on
their
return
to
their
hut
,
their
conversation
naturally
turn
upon
the
demon
of
the
Hartz
and
the
doctrine
of
the
capuchin
.
<EOS>
Maximilian
and
George
Waldeck
,
the
two
eld
brother
,
although
they
allow
the
language
of
the
capuchin
to
have
be
indiscreet
and
worthy
of
censure
,
as
presume
to
determine
upon
the
precise
character
and
abode
of
the
spirit
,
yet
contend
it
be
dangerous
,
in
the
high
degree
,
to
accept
his
gift
,
or
hold
any
communication
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
powerful
they
allow
,
but
wayward
and
capricious
,
and
those
who
have
intercourse
with
him
seldom
come
,
to
a
good
end
.
<EOS>
do
he
not
give
the
brave
knight
,
Echert
of
Rabenwald
,
that
famous
black
steed
,
by
mean
of
which
he
vanquish
all
the
champion
at
the
great
tournament
at
Bremen
?
<EOS>
and
do
not
the
same
steed
afterwards
precipitate
itself
wit
its
rider
into
an
abyss
so
deep
and
fearful
,
that
neither
horse
nor
man
be
ever
see
more
?
<EOS>
have
he
not
give
to
Dame
Gertrude
Trodden
a
curious
spell
for
make
butter
come
?
<EOS>
and
be
she
not
burn
for
a
witch
by
the
grand
criminal
judge
of
the
Electorate
,
because
she
avail
herself
of
his
gift
?
<EOS>
but
these
,
and
many
other
instance
which
they
quote
,
of
mischance
and
ill
--
luck
ultimately
attend
upon
the
apparent
benefit
confer
by
the
Hartz
spirit
,
fail
to
make
any
impression
on
Martin
Waldeck
,
the
young
of
the
brother
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
be
youthful
,
rash
,
and
impetuous
;
excel
in
all
the
exercise
which
distinguish
a
mountaineer
,
and
brave
and
undaunte
from
the
familiar
intercourse
with
the
danger
that
attend
them
.
<EOS>
He
laugh
at
the
timidity
of
his
brother
.
'
<EOS>
tell
me
not
of
such
folly
,
'
he
say
;
'
the
demon
be
a
good
demon
--
he
live
among
us
as
if
he
be
a
peasant
like
ourselves
--
haunt
the
lonely
crag
or
recess
of
the
mountain
like
a
huntsman
or
goatherd
--
and
he
who
love
the
Hartz--
forest
and
its
wild
scene
can
not
be
indifferent
to
the
fate
of
the
hardy
child
of
the
soil
.
<EOS>
but
if
the
demon
be
as
malicious
as
you
make
him
,
how
should
he
derive
power
over
mortal
who
barely
avail
themselves
of
his
gift
,
without
bind
themselves
to
submit
to
his
pleasure
?
'
<EOS>
when
you
carry
your
charcoal
to
the
furnace
,
be
not
the
money
as
good
that
be
pay
you
by
blaspheme
Blaize
,
the
old
reprobate
overseer
,
as
if
you
get
it
from
the
pastor
himself
?
<EOS>
It
be
not
the
goblin
's
gift
which
can
endanger
you
then
,
but
it
be
the
use
you
shall
make
of
them
that
you
must
account
for
.
<EOS>
and
be
the
demon
to
appear
at
this
moment
,
and
indicate
to
me
a
gold
or
silver
mine
,
I
would
begin
to
dig
away
before
his
back
be
turn
,
and
I
would
consider
myself
as
under
protection
of
a
much
Greater
than
he
,
while
I
make
a
good
use
of
the
wealth
he
point
out
tome
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
the
eld
brother
reply
,
that
wealth
ill
won
be
seldom
well
spend
,
while
Martin
presumptuously
declare
,
that
the
possession
of
all
the
Hartz
would
not
make
the
slight
alteration
on
his
habit
,
moral
,
or
character
.
 
<EOS>
His
brother
entreat
Martin
to
talk
less
wildly
upon
this
subject
,
and
with
some
difficulty
contrive
to
withdraw
his
attention
,
by
call
it
to
the
consideration
of
an
approach
boar
chase

this
talk
bring
them
to
their
hut

a
wretched
wigwam
,
situate
upon
one
side
of
a
wild

narrow
,
and
romantic
dell
in
the
recess
of
the
Brockenberg

<EOS>
They
release
their
sister
from
attend
upon
the
operation
of
char
the
wood
,
which
require
constant
attention

and
divide
among
themselves
the
duty
of
watch
it
by
night

accord

wake

Max

during

first
hour

be
considerably
alarm
,
by
observe
upon
the
opposite
bank
of
the
glen
,
or
valley
a
huge
fire
surround
by
some
figure
that
appear
to
wheel
around
it
with
antic
gesture
.
<EOS>
Max
at
first
bethought
him
of
call
up
his
brother
;
but
recollect
the
daring
character
of
the
young
,
and
find
it
impossible
to
wake
the
elder
without
also
disturb
him
--
conceive
also
what
he
see
to
be
an
illusion
of
the
demon
,
send
perhaps
in
consequence
of
the
venturous
expression
use
by
Martin
on
the
precede
evening
,
he
think
it
best
to
betake
himself
to
the
safe
--
guard
of
such
prayer
as
he
could
murmur
over
,
and
to
watch
in
great
terror
and
annoyance
this
strange
and
alarming
apparition
.
<EOS>
after
blaze
for
some
time
,
the
fire
fade
gradually
away
into
darkness
,
and
the
rest
of
Max
's
watch
be
only
disturb
by
the
remembrance
of
its
terror
.
 
<EOS>
George
now
occupy
the
place
of
Max
,
who
have
retire
to
rest
.
<EOS>
the
phenomenon
of
a
huge
blazing
fire
,
upon
the
opposite
bank
of
the
glen
,
again
present
itself
to
the
eye
of
the
watchman
.
<EOS>
It
be
surround
as
before
by
figure
,
which
,
distinguish
by
their
opaque
form
,
be
between
the
spectator
and
the
red
glaring
light
,
move
and
fluctuate
around
it
as
if
engage
in
some
mystical
ceremony
.
<EOS>
George
,
though
equally
caution
,
be
of
a
bold
character
than
his
eld
brother
.
<EOS>
He
resolve
to
examine
more
nearly
the
object
of
his
wonder
;
and
accordingly
,
after
cross
the
rivulet
which
divide
the
glen
,
he
climb
up
the
opposite
bank
,
and
approach
within
an
arrow
's
flight
from
the
fire
,
which
blaze
apparently
with
the
same
fury
as
when
he
first
witness
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
appearance
of
the
assistant
who
surround
it
,
resemble
those
phantom
which
be
see
in
a
troubled
dream
,
and
at
once
confirm
the
idea
he
have
entertain
from
the
first
,
that
they
do
not
belong
to
the
human
world
.
<EOS>
amongst
the
strange
unearthly
form
,
George
Waldeck
distinguish
that
of
a
giant
overgrow
with
hair
,
hold
an
uprooted
fir
in
his
hand
,
with
which
,
from
time
to
time
,
he
seem
to
stir
the
blaze
fire
and
have
no
other
clothing
than
a
wreath
of
oak
leave
round
his
forehead
and
loin
.
<EOS>
George
's
heart
sink
within
him
at
recognize
the
well
--
know
apparition
of
the
Hartz
demon
,
as
he
have
often
be
describe
to
him
by
the
ancient
shepherd
and
huntsman
who
have
see
his
form
traverse
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
He
turn
,
and
be
about
to
fly
;
but
,
upon
second
thought
,
blame
his
own
cowardice
,
he
recite
mentally
the
verse
of
the
Psalmist
,
'
all
good
angel
praise
the
Lord
<EOS>
I
'
which
be
in
that
country
suppose
powerful
as
an
exorcism
and
turn
himself
once
more
towards
the
place
where
he
have
see
the
fire
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
no
longer
visible
.
 
<EOS>
the
pale
moon
alone
enlighten
the
side
of
the
valley
,
and
when
George
,
with
tremble
step
,
a
moist
brow
,
and
hair
bristle
upright
under
his
collier
's
cap
,
come
to
the
spot
where
the
fire
have
be
so
lately
visible
,
mark
as
it
be
by
a
scathed
oak
tree
,
there
appear
not
on
the
heath
<EOS>
the
slight
vestige
of
what
he
have
see
.
<EOS>
the
moss
and
wild
flower
be
unscorche
,
and
the
branch
of
the
oak
tree
,
which
have
so
lately
appear
envelop
in
wreath
of
flame
and
smoke
,
be
moist
with
the
dew
of
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
George
return
to
his
hut
with
tremble
step
,
and
,
argue
like
his
eld
brother
,
resolve
to
say
nothing
of
what
he
have
see
,
lest
he
should
awake
in
Martin
that
dare
curiosity
which
he
almost
deem
to
be
ally
with
impiety
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
Martin
's
turn
to
watch
.
<EOS>
the
household
cock
have
give
his
first
summon
,
and
the
night
be
well
nigh
spend
.
<EOS>
on
examine
the
state
of
the
furnace
in
which
the
wood
be
deposit
in
order
to
its
be
coke
,
or
char
,
he
be
surprised
to
find
that
the
fire
have
nor
be
sufficiently
maintain
;
for
in
his
excursion
and
its
consequence
,
George
have
forget
the
principal
object
of
his
watch
.
<EOS>
Martin
's
first
thought
be
to
call
up
the
slumberer
,
but
observe
that
both
his
brother
sleep
unwontedly
deep
and
heavily
,
he
respect
their
repose
,
and
set
himself
to
supply
their
furnace
with
fuel
,
without
require
their
aid
.
<EOS>
what
he
heap
upon
it
be
apparently
damp
and
unfit
for
the
purpose
,
for
the
fire
seem
rather
to
decay
than
revive
.
<EOS>
Martin
next
go
to
collect
some
bough
from
a
stack
which
have
be
carefully
cut
and
dry
for
this
purpose
;
but
,
when
he
return
,
he
find
the
fire
totally
extinguish
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
serious
evil
,
which
threaten
them
with
loss
of
their
trade
for
more
than
one
day
.
<EOS>
the
vexed
and
mortified
watchman
set
about
to
strike
a
light
in
order
to
rekindle
the
fire
,
but
the
tinder
be
moist
,
and
his
labour
prove
in
this
respect
also
ineffectual
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
about
to
call
up
his
brother
,
for
the
circumstance
seem
to
be
press
,
when
flash
of
light
glimmer
not
only
through
the
window
,
but
through
every
crevice
of
the
rudely
build
hut
,
and
summon
him
to
behold
the
same
apparition
which
have
before
alarm
the
successive
watch
of
his
brother
.
<EOS>
His
first
idea
be
,
that
the
Muhllerhaussers
,
their
rival
in
trade
,
and
with
whom
they
have
have
many
quarrel
,
may
have
encroach
upon
their
bound
for
the
purpose
of
pirate
their
wood
,
and
he
resolve
to
awake
his
brother
,
and
be
revenge
on
them
for
their
audacity
.
<EOS>
but
a
short
reflection
and
observation
on
the
gesture
and
manner
of
those
who
seem
'
to
work
in
the
fire
'
,
induce
him
to
dismiss
this
belief
,
and
although
rather
sceptical
in
these
matter
,
to
conclude
that
what
he
see
be
a
supernatural
phenomenon
.
'
<EOS>
but
be
they
man
or
fiend
,
'
say
the
undaunted
forester
,
'
that
busy
themselves
with
such
fantastical
rite
and
gesture
,
I
will
go
and
demand
a
light
to
rekindle
our
furnace
.
'
<EOS>
He
relinquish
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
idea
of
wake
his
brother
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
belief
that
such
adventure
as
he
be
about
to
undertake
be
accessible
only
to
one
person
at
a
time
;
he
fear
also
that
his
brother
in
their
scrupulous
timidity

interfere
to
prevent
the
investigation
he
have
resolve
to
commence
;
and
therefore
,
snatch
his
boar
--
spear
from
the
wall
,
the
undaunted
Martin
Waldeck
set
forth
on
the
adventure
alone
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
same
success
as
his
brother
George
,
but
with
courage
far
superior
,
Martin
cross
the
brook
,
ascend
the
hill
,
and
approach
so
near
the
ghostly
assembly
that
he
could
recognize
,
in
the
preside
figure
,
the
attribute
of
the
Hartz
demon
.
<EOS>
a
cold
shuddering
assail
him
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
but
the
recollection
that
he
have
at
a
distance
dare
and
even
court
the
intercourse
which
be
now
about
to
take
place
,
confirm
his
staggering
courage
,
and
pride
supply
what
he
want
in
resolution
,
he
advance
with
tolerable
firmness
towards
the
fire
;
the
figure
which
surround
it
appear
more
phantastical
,
and
supernatural
,
the
nearer
he
approach
to
the
assembly
.
<EOS>
He
be
receive
with
a
loud
shout
of
discord
and
unnatural
laughter
,
which
,
to
his
stunned
ear
,
seem
more
alarming
than
a
combination
of
the
most
dismal
and
melancholy
sound
which
could
be
imagined.----'Who
art
thou
?
'
<EOS>
say
the
giant
compress
his
savage
and
exaggerated
feature
into
a
sort
of
force
gravity
,
while
they
be
occasionally
agitate
by
the
convulsion
of
the
laughter
which
he
seem
to
suppress
.
 
<EOS>
'
Martin
Waldeck
,
the
forester
,

answer
the
hardy
youth;----'and
who
be
you
?
'
 
<EOS>
the
king
of
the
waste
and
of
the
mine
,
'
answer
the
spectre;----'And
why
hast
thou
dare
to
encroach
on
my
mystery
?
'
 
<EOS>
'
I
come
in
search
of
light
to
rekindle
my
fire
,
'
answer
Martin
hardily
,
and
then
resolutely
ask
in
his
turn
,
'
what
mystery
be
these
that
you
celebrate
here
?
'
 
<EOS>
'
We
celebrate
,
'
answer
the
demoniac
be
,
'
the
wedding
of
Hermes
with
the
Black
Dragon.--But
take
thy
fire
that
thou
cam
to
seek

and
begone

mortal
may
long
look
upon
us

'
 
<EOS>
the
peasant
stick
his
spear
point
into
a
large
piece
of
blaze
wood
,
which
he
heave
with
some
difficulty
,
and
then
turn
round
to
regain
his
hut
,
the
shout
of
laughter
be
renew
behind
him
with
treble
violence
,
and
ring
far
down
the
narrow
valley
.
<EOS>
when
Martin
return
to
the
hut
,
his
first
care
,
however
much
astonish
with
what
he
have
see
,
be
to
dispose
the
kindle
coal
among
the
fuel
so
as
may
best
light
the
fire
of
his
furnace
,
but
after
many
effort
,
and
all
exertion
of
bellow
and
fire
prong
,
the
coal
he
have
bring
from
the
demon
's
fire
become
totally
extinct
,
without
kindle
any
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
He
turn
about
and
observe
the
fire
still
blaze
on
the
hill
,
although
those
who
have
be
busy
around
it
have
disappear
.
<EOS>
as
he
conceive
the
spectre
have
be
jest
with
him
,
he
give
way
to
the
natural
hardihood
of
his
temper
,
and
determine
to
see
the
adventure
to
the
end
,
resume
the
road
to
the
fire
,
from
which
,
unoppose
by
the
demon
,
he
bring
off
in
the
same
manner
a
blaze
piece
of
charcoal
but
still
without
be
able
to
succeed
in
light
his
fire

<EOS>
impunity
have
increase
his
rashness
,
he
resolve
upon
a
third
experiment
,
and
be
as
successful
as
before
in
reach
the
fire
;
<EOS>
but
,
when
he
have
again
appropriate
a
piece
of
burn
coal
,
and
have
turn
to
depart
,
he
hear
the
harsh
and
supernatural
voice
which
have
before
accost
him
,
pronounce
these
word
;
'
dare
not
to
return
hither
a
fourth
time
!
'
 
<EOS>
the
attempt
to
rekindle
the
fire
with
this
last
coal
have
prove
as
ineffectual
as
on
the
former
occasion
<EOS>
,
Martin
relinquish
the
hopeless
attempt
,
and
fling
himself
on
his
bed
of
leave
,
resolve
to
delay
till
the
next
morning
the
communication
of
his
supernatural
adventure
to
his
brother
.
<EOS>
He
be
awaken
from
a
heavy
sleep
into
which
he
have
sink
,
from
fatigue
of
body
and
agitation
of
mind
,
by
loud
exclamation
of
joy

surprise

His
brother

astonish
at
find
the
be
extinguish
when
they
awoke
,
have
proceed
to
arrange
the
fuel
in
order
to
renew
it
,
when
they
find
in
the
ashe
three
huge
metallic
masse
,
which
<EOS>
their
skill
,
(
for
most
of
the
peasant
in
the
Hartz
be
practise
mineralogist
,
)
immediately
ascertain
to
be
pure
gold
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
some
damp
upon
their
joyful
congratulation
when
they
learn
from
Martin
the
mode
in
which
he
have
obtain
this
treasure
,
to
which
their
own
experience
of
the
nocturnal
vision
induce
them
to
give
full
credit
.
<EOS>
but
they
be
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
of
share
their
brother
's
wealth
.
<EOS>
take
now
upon
him
as
head
of
the
house
,
Martin
Waldeck
buy
land
and
forest
,
build
a
castle
,
obtain
a
patent
of
nobility
,
and
greatly
to
the
scorn
of
the
ancient
nobility
of
the
neighbourhood
,
be
invest
with
all
the
privilege
of
a
man
of
family
.
<EOS>
His
courage
in
public
war
,
as
well
as
in
private
feud
,
together
with
the
number
of
retainer
whom
he
keep
in
pay
,
sustain
him
for
some
time
against
the
odium
which
be
excite
by
his
sudden
elevation
,
and
the
arrogance
of
his
pretension
.
<EOS>
now
it
be
see
in
the
instance
of
Martin
Waldeck
,
as
it
have
be
in
that
of
many
other
,
how
little
mortal
can
foresee
the
effect
of
sudden
prosperity
on
their
own
disposition
.
<EOS>
the
evil
disposition
in
his
nature
,
which
poverty
have
check
and
repress
,
ripen
and
bear
their
unhallowed
fruit
under
the
influence
of
temptation
and
the
mean
of
indulgence

as
deep
call
unto
Deep

one
bad

another:--the
fiend
of
avarice
invoke
that
of
pride
,
and
pride
be
to
be
support
by
cruelty
and
oppression
.
<EOS>
Waldeck
's
character
,
always
bold
and
daring
,
but
render
more
harsh
and
assume
by
prosperity
,
soon
make
him
odious
,
not
to
noble
only
,
but
likewise
to
the
low
rank
,
who
see
,
with
double
dislike
,
the
oppressive
right
of
the
feudal
nobility
of
the
empire
so
remorselessly
exercise
by
one
who
have
rise
from
the
very
dreg
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
His
adventure
,
although
carefully
conceal
,
begin
likewise
to
be

,
and
the
clergy
already
stigmatize
as
a
wizard
and
accomplice
of

the
wretch

who
,
have
acquire
so
huge
a
treasure
in
so
strange
a
manner
have
not

to
sanctify
it
by

a
considerable
portion
to
the

torment
by
a
thousand
feud

with
excommunication

as
we
must
now
call
him
the
Baron
Von
Waldeck
,
often
regret
bitterly
the
labour
and
sport
of
unenvied
poverty
.
<EOS>
but
his
courage
fail
him
not
under
all
these
difficulty
and
seem
rather
to
augment
in
proportion
to
the
danger
which
darken
around
him
,
until
an
accident
precipitate
his
fall
.
 
<EOS>
a
proclamation
by
the
reign
Duke
of
Brunswick
have
invite
to
a
solemn
tournament
all

,
splendidly
armed
,
accompany
by
his
two
brother
,
and
a
gallantly
equipped
retinue
,
have
the
arrogance
to
appear
among

province
and
demand
permission
to
enter

this

'
<EOS>
irritated
to
frenzy
,
Martin
draw
his
sword
,
and
hew
down
the
herald
who
,
in
compliance
with
the
general
outcry
,
oppose
his

what

in

,
regard
as
a
crime
only
inferior
to

after
defend

with
the
fury
of
a
lion
,
be
seize
,
try
on
the
spot
by
the
judge
of
the
list
,
and
condemn
,
as
the
appropriate
punishment
for
break
the
peace
of
his
sovereign
and
violate
the
sacred
person
of
a
herald--
at

arm
,
to
have
his
right
hand
strike
from
his

ignominiously
deprive
of
the
honour
of
nobility

of
which
he
be
unworthy

expel
from

<EOS>
when
he
have
be
strip
of
his

,
and
sustain
the
mutilation
impose
by
this
severe
sentence
,
the
unhappy
victim
of
ambition
be
abandon
to
the
rabble
,
who
follow
him
with
threat
and
outcry
,
level
alternately
against
the
necromancer
and
oppressor
,
which
at
length
end
in
violence
.
<EOS>
His
brother
,
(
for
his
retinue
have
flee
and
disperse
)
at
length
succeed
in
rescue
him
from
the
hand
of
the
populace
,
when
,
satiate
with
cruelty
,
they
have
leave
him
half
dead
through
loss
of
blood
,
through
the
outrage
he
have
sustain
.
<EOS>
They
be
not
permit
,
such
be
the
ingenious
cruelty
of
their
enemy
,
to
make
use
of
any
other
mean
of
remove
him
,
except
such
a
collier
's
cart
as
they
have
themselves
formerly
use
,
in
which
they
deposit
their

on
a
truss
of
straw

<EOS>
when
the
Waldecks
,
journey
in
this
miserable
manner
,
have
approach
the
verge
of
their
native
country
,
in
a
hollow
way
,
between
two
mountain
,
they
perceive
a
figure
advance
towards
them
,
which
at
first
sight
seem
to
be
an
aged
man
.
<EOS>
but
as
he
approach
,
his
limb
and
stature
increase
,
the
cloak
fall
from
his
shoulder
,
his
pilgrim
's
staff
be
change
into
an
uprooted
pine
tree
,
and
the
gigantic
figure
of
the
Hartz
demon
pass
before
them
in
his
terror
.
<EOS>
when
he
come
opposite
to
the
cart
which
contain
the
miserable
Waldeck
,
his
huge
feature
dilate
into
a
grin
of
unutterable
contempt
and
malignity
,
as
he
ask
the
sufferer
,
'
how
like
you
the
fire
<EOS>
my
coal
have
kindle
!
'
<EOS>
the
power
of
motion
,
which
terror
suspend
in
his
two
brother
,
seem
to
be
restore
to
Martin
by
the
energy
of
his
courage
.
<EOS>
He
raise
himself
on
the
cart
,
bend
his
brow
,
and
,
clench
his
fist
,
shake
it
at
the
spectre
with
a
ghastly
look
of
hate
and
defiance
.
<EOS>
the
goblin
vanish
with
his
usual
tremendous
and
explosive
laugh
and
leave
Waldeck
exhaust
with
the
effort
of
expire
nature
.
 
<EOS>
the
terrified
brother
turn
their
vehicle
towards
the
tower
of
a
convent
which
arise
in
a
wood
of
pine
tree
beside
the
road
.
<EOS>
They
be
charitably
receive
by
a
bare
--
footed
and
long
--
bearded
capuchin
,
and
Martin
survive
only
to
complete
the
first
confession
he
have
make
since
the
day
of
his
sudden
prosperity
,
and
to
receive
absolution
from
the
very
priest
,
whom
,
precisely
that
day
three
year
,
he
have
assist
to
pelt
out
of
the
hamlet
of
Morgenbrodt
.
<EOS>
the
three
year
of
precarious
prosperity
be
suppose
to
have
a
mysterious
correspondence
with
the
number
of
his
visit
to
the
spectral
fire
upon
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
the
body
of
Martin
Waldeck
be
inter
in
the
convent
where
he
expire
,
in
which
his
brother
,
have
assume
the
habit
of
the
order
,
live
and
die
in
the
performance
of
act
of
charity
and
devotion
.
<EOS>
His
land
,
to
which
no
one
assert
any
claim
,
lay
waste
until
they
be
reassume
by
the
emperor
as
a
lapse
fief
,
and
the
ruin
of
the
castle
,
which
Waldeck
have
call
by
his
own
name
,
be
still
shun
by
the
miner
and
forester
as
haunt
by
evil
spirit

<EOS>
thus
be
the
evil
attendant
