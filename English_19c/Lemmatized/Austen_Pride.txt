It

be
in

however

this
truth

well
fix

it
be
very
likely

I
do
not
pretend

when

It

only

Sir

Mr.

sarcastic
humour

reserve

caprice

that
the
experience
of
three

twenty

be
insufficient

make
his

his

could
ask

be
sufficient
to
draw
from

any
satisfactory
description

attack
him
in
various
way

report

nothing
could

the

somewhat
more
fortunate

every

<EOS>
amongst
the

at

it

Your

it
would
not

coldly
say
,
"
She

;
and
I
be
in
no
humour
at
present
to
give
consequence
to
young
lady
who

<EOS>
You

and
enjoy
her
smile
,
for
you
be
waste
your
time
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bingley
follow
his
advice
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
walk
off
;
and
Elizabeth
remain
with
no
very
cordial
feeling
towards
him
.
<EOS>
She
tell
the
story
however
with
great
spirit
among
her
friend
;
for
she
have
a
lively
,
playful
disposition
,
which
delight
in
any
thing
ridiculous
.
  
<EOS>
the
evening
altogether
pass
off
pleasantly
to
the
whole
family
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
have
see
her
eld
daughter
much
admire
by
the
Netherfield
party
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bingley
have
dance
with
her
twice
,
and
she
have
be
distinguish
by
his
sister
.
<EOS>
Jane
be
as
much
gratify
by
this
,
as
her
mother
could
be
,
though
in
a
quieter
way
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
feel
Jane
's
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Mary
have
hear
herself
mention
to
Miss
Bingley
as
the
most
accomplished
girl
in
the
neighbourhood
;
and
Catherine
and
Lydia
have
be
fortunate
enough
to
be
never
without
partner
,
which
be
all
that
they
have
yet
learn
to
care
for
at
a
ball
.
<EOS>
They
return
therefore
in
good
spirit
to
Longbourn
,
the
village
where
they
live
,
and
of
which
they
be
the
principal
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
They
find
Mr.
Bennet
still
up
.
<EOS>
with
a
book
he
be
regardless
of
time
;
and
on
the
present
occasion
he
have
a
good
deal
of
curiosity
as
to
the
event
of
an
evening
which
have
raise
such
splendid
expectation
.
<EOS>
He
have
rather
hope
that
all
his
wife
's
view
on
the
stranger
would
be
disappoint
;
but
he
soon
find
that
he
have
a
very
different
story
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
my
dear
Mr.
Bennet
,
"
as
she
enter
the
room
,
"
we
have
have
a
most
delightful
evening
,
a
most
excellent
ball
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
have
be
there
.
<EOS>
Jane
be
so
admired
,
nothing
could
be
like
it
.
<EOS>
every
body
say
how
well
she
look
;
and
Mr.
Bingley
think
her
quite
beautiful
,
and
dance
with
her
twice
.
<EOS>
only
think
of
_
that
_
<EOS>
my
dear
;
he
actually
dance
with
her
twice
;
and
she
be
the
only
creature
in
the
room
that
he
ask
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
first
of
all
,
he
ask
Miss
Lucas
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
vexed
to
see
him
stand
up
with
her
;
but
,
however
,
he
do
not
admire
her
at
all
:
indeed
,
nobody
can
,
you
know
;
and
he
seem
quite
strike
with
Jane
as
she
be
go
down
the
dance
.
<EOS>
so
,
he
enquire
who
she
be
,
and
get
introduce
,
and
ask
her
for
the
two
next
.
<EOS>
then
,
the
two
third
he
dance
with
Miss
King
,
and
the
two
fourth
with
Maria
Lucas
,
and
the
two
fifth
with
Jane
again
,
and
the
two
sixth
with
Lizzy
,
and
the
Boulanger
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
if
he
have
have
any
compassion
for
_
me
_
,
"
cry
her
husband
impatiently
,
"
he
would
not
have
dance
half
so
much
!
<EOS>
for
God
's
sake
,
say
no
more
of
his
partner
.
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
that
he
have
sprain
his

quite
delighted
with
him

<EOS>
He
be
so
excessively
handsome
!
<EOS>
and
his
sister
be
charm
woman
.
<EOS>
I
never
in
my
life
see
any
thing
more
elegant
than
their
dress
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
the
lace
upon
Mrs.
Hurst
's
gown
 
<EOS>
"
  
here
she
be
interrupt
again
.
<EOS>
Mr.

protest
against
any
description
of
finery
.
<EOS>
She
be
therefore
oblige
to
seek
another
branch
of
the
subject
,
and
relate
,
with
much
bitterness
of
spirit
and
some
exaggeration
,
the
shocking
rudeness
of
Mr.
Darcy
.
  
<EOS>

I
can
assure
you

she

that

"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
listen
in
silence
,
but
be
not
convinced
;
their
behaviour
at
the
assembly
have
not
be
calculate
to
please
in
general
;
and
with
more
quickness
of
observation
and
less
pliancy
of
temper
than
her
sister
,
and
with
a
judgment
too
unassailed
by
any
attention
to
herself
,
she
be
very
little
disposed
to
approve
them
.
<EOS>
They
be
in

very
fine

not
deficient

good
humour
when
they

they

proud

conceited

<EOS>
They

rather
handsome

have
be
educate

have
a
fortune
of
twenty
thousand
pound
,
be
in
the
habit
of
spend
more
than
they
ought
,
and
of
associate
with
people
of
rank
;
and
be
therefore
in
every
respect
entitle
to
think
well
of
themselves
,
and
meanly
of
other
.
<EOS>
They
be
of
a
respectable
family
in
the
north
of
England
;
a
circumstance
more
deeply
impressed
on
their
memory
than
that
their
brother

fortune

be
acquire
by
trade

Mr.

Mr.

house
and
the
liberty
of
a
manor
,
it
be
doubtful
to
many
of
those
who
best
know
the
easiness
of
his
temper
,
whether
he
may
not
spend
the
remainder
of
his
day
at
Netherfield
,
and
leave
the
next
generation
to
purchase
.
  
<EOS>
His
sister
be
very
anxious
for
his
have
an
estate
of
his
own
;
but
though
he
be
now
establish
only
as
a
tenant
,
Miss
Bingley
be
by
no
mean
unwilling
to
preside
at
his
table
,
nor
be
Mrs.
Hurst
,
who
have
marry
a
man
of
more
fashion
than
fortune
,
less
disposed
to
consider
his
house
as
her
home
when
it
suit
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bingley
have
not
be
of
age
two
year
,
when
he
be
tempt
by
an
accidental
recommendation
to
look
at
Netherfield
House
.
<EOS>
He
do
look
at
it
and
into
it
for
half
an
hour
,
be
pleased
with
the
situation
and
the
principal
room
,
satisfied
with
what
the
owner
say
in
its
praise
,
and
take
it
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
between
him
and
Darcy
there
be
a
very
steady
friendship
,
in
spite
of
a
great
opposition
of
character
.
 
<EOS>
Bingley
be
endear
to
Darcy
by
the
easiness
,
openness
,
ductility
of
his
temper
,
though
no
disposition
could
offer
a
great
contrast
to
his
own
,
and
though
with
his
own
he
never
appear
dissatisfied
.
<EOS>
on
the
strength
of
Darcy
's
regard
Bingley
have
the
firm
reliance
,
and
of
his
judgment
the
high
opinion
.
<EOS>
in
understand
Darcy
be
the
superior
.
<EOS>
Bingley
be
by
no
mean
deficient
,
but
Darcy
be
clever
.
<EOS>
He
be
at
the
same
time
haughty
,
reserved
,
and
fastidious
,
and
his
manner
,
though
well
breed
,
be
not
invite
.
<EOS>
in
that
respect
his
friend
have
greatly
the
advantage
.
<EOS>
Bingley
be
sure
of
be
like
wherever
he
appear
,
Darcy
be
continually
give
offence
.
  
<EOS>
the
manner
in
which
they
speak
of
the
Meryton
assembly
be
sufficiently
characteristic
.
<EOS>
Bingley
have
never
meet
with
pleasanter
people
or
pretty
girl
in
his
life
;
every
body
have
be
most
kind
and
attentive
to
him
<EOS>
,
there
have
be
no
formality
,
no
stiffness
,
he
have
soon
feel
acquaint
with
all
the
room
;
and
as
to
Miss
Bennet
,
he
could
not
conceive
an
angel
more
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Darcy
,
on
the
contrary
,
have
see
a
collection
of
people
in
whom
there
be
little
beauty
and
no
fashion
,
for
none
of
whom
he
have
feel
the
small
interest
,
and
from
none
receive
either
attention
or
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bennet
he
acknowledge
to
be
pretty
,
but
she
smile
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hurst
and
her
sister
allow
it
to
be
so
 
<EOS>
but
still
they
admire
her
and
like
her
,
and
pronounce
her
to
be
a
sweet
girl
,
and
one
whom
they
should
not
object
to
know
more
of
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bennet
be
therefore
establish
as
a
sweet
girl
,
and
their
brother
feel
authorise
by
such
commendation
to
think
of
her
as
he
choose
.
    
<EOS>
within
a
short
walk
of
Longbourn
live
a
family
with
whom
the
Bennets
be
particularly
intimate
.
<EOS>
Sir
William
Lucas
have
be
formerly
in
trade
in
Meryton
,
where
he
have
make
a
tolerable
fortune
and
rise
to
the
honour
of
knighthood
by
an
address
to
the
King
,
during
his
mayoralty
.
<EOS>
the
distinction
have
perhaps
be
feel
too
strongly
.
<EOS>
It
have
give
him
a
disgust
to
his
business
and
to
his
residence
in
a
small
market
town
;
and
quit
them
both
,
he
have
remove
with
his
family
to
a
house
about
a
mile
from
Meryton
,
denominate
from
that
period
<EOS>
Lucas
Lodge
,
where
he
could
think
with
pleasure
of
his
own
importance
,
and
unshackle
by
business
,
occupy
himself
solely
in
be
civil
to
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
for
though
elate
by
his
rank
,
it
do
not
render
him
supercilious
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
be
all
attention
to
every
body
.
<EOS>
by
nature
inoffensive
,
friendly
and
obliging
,
his
presentation
at
St.
James
's
have
make
him
courteous
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Lucas
be
a
very
good
kind
of
woman

not

clever
to
be
a
valuable

to

intelligent
young

about
twenty

Elizabeth

intimate

<EOS>
that
the
Miss
Lucases
and
the
Miss
Bennets
should
meet
to
talk
over
a
ball
be
absolutely
necessary
;
and
the
morning
after
the
assembly
bring
the
former
to
Longbourn
to
hear

perhaps
you
mean
what
I
overhear
between
him
and
Mr.
Robinson
;
do
not
I
mention
it
to
you
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Robinson

ask
him
how
he
like
our
Meryton
assembly
,
and
whether
he
do
not
think
there
be

pretty

in

question

oh

<EOS>
the
eld
Miss

Charlotte

"
<EOS>
Mr.

be
not

Poor

I
beg
you
would
not
put
it
into

head
to
be
vex
by

ill

treatment

for
he
be
such
a
disagreeable

that
it

be
quite
a

<EOS>
Mrs.
Long
tell

last
night

close

<EOS>
"
I
certainly
see
Mr.

speak
to
her

aye
 
because
she
ask
him
at
last
how

she

Miss

I
do
not

if
he

be

very
agreeable
he
would
have
talk
to
Mrs.
Long

<EOS>
but
I
can
guess
how
it
be
;
every
body
say
that
he
be
eat
up
with
pride

I
dare
say
he
have
hear
somehow
that
Mrs.
Long
do
not
keep
a
carriage

have
come
to
the
ball
in
a

<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mind
his
not
talk
to
Mrs.

Miss

I
wish
he
have
dance
with
Eliza

<EOS>
"
  
"
another
time

Lizzy

her
mother

"
I

I

<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
madam

I
may
safely
promise
you

<EOS>
"
His

Miss

do
not

so
much

often

with

fortune

every

a

"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
very
true

Elizabeth

I

a
very
common
failing
I
believe
.
<EOS>
by
all
that
I
have
ever
read
,
I
be
convinced
that
it
be
very
common
indeed
,
that
human
nature
be
particularly
prone
to
it
,
and
that
there
be
very
few
of
us
who
do
not
cherish
a
feeling
of
self
-
complacency
on
the
score
of
some
quality

other

real
or
imaginary

<EOS>
vanity
and
pride
be
different
thing
,
though
the
word
be
often
use
synonimously
.
<EOS>
a
person
may
be
proud
without
be
vain
.
<EOS>
pride
relate
more
to
our
opinion

ourselves

vanity
to
what
we
would
have
other
think
of

rich

a

Lucas

;

if
I
be
to
see
you
at
it

I
should
take
away
your
bottle
directly

"
  
<EOS>
the
boy
protest
that
she
should
not

she
continue
to
declare
that
she
would

the
argument
end
only
with
the
visit

the

Longbourn
soon

the

form

<EOS>
Miss
Bennet
's
pleasing
manner
grow
on
the
good
will
of
Mrs.
Hurst
and
Miss
Bingley
;
and
though
the
mother
be
find
to
be
intolerable
and
the
young
sister
not
worth
speak
to
,
a
wish
of
be
better
acquaint
with
_
them
_
,
be
express
towards
the
two
eld
.
<EOS>
by
Jane
this
attention
be
receive
with
the
great
pleasure
;
but
Elizabeth
still
see
superciliousness
in
their
treatment
of
every
body
,
hardly
except
even
her
sister
,
and
could
not
like
them
;
though
their
kindness
to
Jane
,
such
as
it
be
,
have
a
value
as
arise
in
all
probability
from
the
influence
of
their
brother
's
admiration
.
<EOS>
It
be
generally
evident
whenever
they
meet
,
that
he
_
do
_
admire
her
;
and
to
_
<EOS>
her
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
it
be
equally
evident
that
Jane
be
yield
to
the
preference
which
she
have
begin
to
entertain
for
him
from
the
first
,
and
be
in
a
way
to
be
very
much
in
love
;
but
she
consider
with
pleasure
that
it
be
not
likely
to
be
discover
by
the
world
in
general
,
since
Jane
unite
with
great
strength
of
feeling
,
a
composure
of
temper
and
a
uniform
cheerfulness
of
manner
,
which
would
guard
her
from
the
suspicion
of
the
impertinent
.
<EOS>
She
mention
this
to
her
friend
Miss
Lucas
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
perhaps
be
pleasant
,
"
reply
Charlotte
,
"
to
be
able
to
impose
on
the
public
in
such
a
case
;
but
it
be
sometimes
a
disadvantage
to
be
so
very
guard
.
<EOS>
if
a
woman
conceal
her
affection
with
the
same
skill
from
the
object
of
it
,
she
may
lose
the
opportunity
of
fix
him
;
and
it
will
then
be
but
poor
consolation
to
believe
the
world
equally
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
there
be
so
much
of
gratitude
or
vanity
in
almost
every
attachment
,
that
it
be
not
safe
to
leave
any
to
itself
.
<EOS>
We
can
all
_
begin
_
freely
 
a
slight
preference
be
natural
enough
;
but
there
be
very
few
of
us
who
have
heart
enough
to
be
really
in
love
without
encouragement
.
<EOS>
in
nine
case
out
of
ten
,
a
woman
have
well
shew
_
more
_
affection
than
she
feel
.
<EOS>
Bingley
like
your
sister
undoubtedly
;
but
he
may
never
do
more
than
like
her
,
if
she
do
not
help
him
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
she
do
help
him
on
,
as
much
as
her
nature
will
allow
.
<EOS>
if
_
I
_
can
perceive
her
regard
for
him
,
he
must
be
a
simpleton
indeed
not
to
discover
it
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
remember
,
Eliza
,
that
he
do
not
know
Jane
's
disposition
as
you
do
.
"
  
"
but
if
a
woman
be
partial
to
a
man
,
and
do
not
endeavour
to
conceal
it
,
he
must
find
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
he
must
,
if
he
see
enough
of
her
.
<EOS>
but
though
Bingley
and
Jane
meet
tolerably
often
,
it
be
never
for
many
hour
together
;
and
as
they
always
see
each
other
in
large
mixed
party
,
it
be
impossible
that
every
moment
should
be
employ
in
converse
together
.
<EOS>
Jane
should
therefore
make
the
most
of
every
half
hour
in
which
she
can
command
his
attention
.
<EOS>
when
she
be
secure
of
him
,
there
will
be
leisure
for
fall
in
love
as
much
as
she
chuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
plan
be
a
good
one
,
"
reply
Elizabeth
,
"
where
nothing
be
in
question
but
the
desire
of
be
well
married

I

get

rich
husband
,
or
any
husband
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
I
should
adopt
it

these

she

interest
in

eye

<EOS>
Mr.

have
at
first
scarcely
allow
her
to
be
pretty
;
he
have
look
at
her
without
admiration
at
the
ball
;
and
when
they
next
meet
,
he
look
at
her
only
to
criticise
.
<EOS>
but
no
sooner
have
he
make
it
clear
to
himself

his

be
render
uncommonly
intelligent

the
beautiful
expression

her
dark
eye

this
discovery
succeed
some
other
equally
mortify

<EOS>
though
he
have
detect
with
a
critical
eye
more
than
one
failure
of
perfect
symmetry
in
her
form
,
he
be
force
to
acknowledge
her
figure
to
be
light
and
pleasing
;
and
in
spite
of
his
asserting
that
her
manner
be
not
those
of
the
fashionable
world
,
he
be
catch
by
their
easy
playfulness

no

<EOS>
He
begin
to

know

it

Mr.

be
worthless
in

after

one
morning
to
their
effusion
on

Mr.

,
  
"
from
all
that
I
can
collect
by
your
manner
of
talking

you
must
be
two
of
the
silly

I
have
suspect
it
some

I
be
now
convinced

<EOS>
Catherine

disconcert

Lydia

with
perfect
indifference

continue
to
express
her
admiration
of
Captain
Carter

her
hope

see
him

London

<EOS>
"
I
be
astonished
,
my

say
Mrs.
Bennet

"
that
you
should
be
so
ready

your

silly

if
I

slightingly
of

it
should
not

yes

they

this
be
the
only
point

I
flatter
myself
,
on
which
we
do
not
agree

<EOS>
I
have
hope
that
our
sentiment
coincide
in
every
particular

I
must
so
far
differ
from
you
as
to
think
our
two
young

uncommonly
foolish

<EOS>

My
dear
Mr.
Bennet
,
you
must
not

such
girl
to
have
the
sense

their
father

<EOS>
when
they
get
to
our
age
I
dare
say
they
will
not
think
about
officer
any
more
than
we
do

I
remember
the
time
when
I
like
a
red
coat
myself
very
well

indeed
<EOS>
so
I
do
still
at

with
five

six
thousand

should
want
one
of
my
girl

I
shall
not

nay

Colonel

no

I
admire
the

observe
Mary

every
impulse

feeling

be
guide
by
reason

in

exertion

in
proportion

what

We

if

<EOS>
in
Meryton
they
part
;
the
two
young

to
the
lodging
of
one
of
the
officer

wife

and
Elizabeth
continue
her
walk
alone
,
cross
field
after
field
at
a
quick
pace
,
jump
over
stile
and
spring
over
puddle
with
impatient
activity

and
find
herself
at
last
within
view
of
the
house

with
weary
ancle

dirty
stocking

and
a
face
glow

warmth

She

parlour

where
all

Jane

and
where
her
appearance

a
great
deal
of
surprise

<EOS>
that
she
should
have
walk
three
mile
so
early
in
the
day
,
in
such
dirty
weather
,
and
by
herself
,
be
almost
incredible
to
Mrs.
Hurst
and
Miss
Bingley
;
and
Elizabeth
be
convince
that
they
hold
her
in
contempt
for
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
receive
,
however
,
very
politely
by
them
;
and
in
their
brother
's
manner
there
be
something
well
than
politeness
;
there
be
good
humour
and
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
say
very
little
,
and
Mr.
Hurst
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
the
former
be
divide
between
admiration
of
the
brilliancy
which
exercise
have
give
to
her
complexion
,
and
doubt
as
to
the
occasion
's
justify
her
come
so
far
alone
.
<EOS>
the
latter
be
think
only
of
his
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
Her
enquiry
after
her
sister
be
not
very
favourably
answer
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bennet
have
sleep
ill
,
and
though
up
,
be
very
feverish
and
not
well
enough
to
leave
her
room
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
glad
to
be
take
to
her
immediately
;
and
Jane
,
who
have
only
be
withhold
by
the
fear
of
give
alarm
or
inconvenience
,
from
express
in
her
note
how
much
she
long
for
such
a
visit
,
be
delighted
at
her
entrance
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
equal
,
however
,
to
much
conversation
,
and
when
Miss
Bingley
leave
them
together
,
could
attempt
little
beside
expression
of
gratitude
for
the
extraordinary
kindness
she
be
treat
with
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
silently
attend
her
.
  
<EOS>
when
breakfast
be
over
,
they
be
join
by
the
sister
;
and
Elizabeth
begin
to
like
them
herself
,
when
she
see
how
much
affection
and
solicitude
they
shew
for
Jane
.
<EOS>
the
apothecary
come
,
and
have
examine
his
patient
,
say
,
as
may
be
suppose
,
that
she
have
catch
a
violent
cold
,
and
that
they
must
endeavour
to
get
the
well
of
it
;
advise
her
to
return
to
bed
,
and
promise
her
some
draught
.
<EOS>
the
advice
be
follow
readily
,
for
the
feverish
symptom
increase
,
and
her
head
ache
acutely
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
do
not
quit
her
room
for
a
moment
,
nor
be
the
other
lady
often
absent
;
the
gentleman
be
out
,
they
have
in
fact
nothing
to
do
elsewhere
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
clock
strike
three
,
Elizabeth
feel
that
she
must
go
;
and
very
unwillingly
say
so
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bingley
offer
her
the
carriage
,
and
she
only
want
a
little
pressing
to
accept
it
,
when
Jane
testify
such
concern
in
part
with
her
,
that
Miss
Bingley
be
oblige
to
convert
the
offer
of
the
chaise
into
an
invitation
to
remain
at
Netherfield
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
most
thankfully
consent
,
and
a
servant
be
dispatch
to
Longbourn
to
acquaint
the
family
with
her
stay
,
and
bring
back
a
supply
of
clothe
.
    
<EOS>
at
five
o'clock
the
two
lady
retire
to
dress
,
and
at
half
past
six
Elizabeth
be
summon
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
to
the
civil
enquiry
which
then
pour
in
,
and
amongst
which
she
have
the
pleasure
of
distinguish
the
much
superior
solicitude
of
Mr.
Bingley
's
,
she
could
not
make
a
very
favourable
answer
.
<EOS>
Jane
be
by
no
mean
better
.
<EOS>
the
sister
,
on
hear
this
,
repeat
three
or
four
time
how
much
they
be
grieve
,
how
shocking
it
be
to
have
a
bad
cold
,
and
how
excessively
they
dislike
be
ill
themselves
;
and
then
think
no
more
of
the
matter
:
and
their
indifference
towards
Jane
when
not
immediately
before
them
,
restore
Elizabeth
to
the
enjoyment
of
all
her
original
dislike
.
  
<EOS>
Their
brother
,
indeed
,
be
the
only
one
of
the
party
whom
she
could
regard
with
any
complacency
.
<EOS>
His
anxiety
for
Jane
be
evident
,
and
his
attention
to
herself
most
pleasing
,
and
they
prevent
her
feel
herself
so
much
an
intruder
as
she
believe
she
be
consider
by
the
other
.
<EOS>
She
have
very
little
notice
from
any
but
him
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bingley
be
engross
by
Mr.
Darcy
,
her
sister
scarcely
less
so
;
and
as
for
Mr.
Hurst
,
by
whom
Elizabeth
sit
,
he
be
an
indolent
man
,
who
live
only
to
eat
,
drink
,
and
play
at
card
,
who
when
he
find
her
prefer
a
plain
dish
to
a
ragout
,
have
nothing
to
say
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
when
dinner
be
over
,
she
return
directly
to
Jane
,
and
Miss
Bingley
begin
abuse
her
as
soon
as
she
be
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
be
pronounce
to
be
very
bad
indeed
,
a
mixture
of
pride
and
impertinence
;
she
have
no
conversation
,
no
style
,
<EOS>
no
taste
,
no
beauty

<EOS>
Mrs.
Hurst
think
the
same
,
and
add
,
  
"
She
have
nothing
,
in
short
,
to
recommend
her
,
but
be
an
excellent
walker
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
her
appearance
this
morning

<EOS>
She
really
look
almost
wild

She

my
countenance
.
<EOS>
very
nonsensical
to
come
at
all
!
<EOS>
why
must
_
she
_
be
scamper
about
the
country
,
because
her
sister
have
a
cold
?
<EOS>
Her
hair
so
untidy
,
so
blowsy
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
,
and
her
petticoat
<EOS>
;
I
hope
you
see
her
petticoat
,
six
inch
deep
in
mud
,
I
be
absolutely
certain
;
and
the
gown
which
have
be
let
down
to
hide
it
,
not
do
its
office
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
picture
may
be
very
exact
,
Louisa
,
"
say
Bingley
;
"
but
this
be
all
lose
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
Miss
Elizabeth
Bennet
look
remarkably
well
,
when
she
come
into
the
room
this
morning
.
<EOS>
Her
dirty
petticoat
quite
escape
my
notice
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
_
You
_
observe
it
,
Mr.
Darcy
,
I
be
sure
,
"
say
Miss
Bingley
;
"
and
I
be
inclined
to
think
that
you
would
not
wish
to
see
_
<EOS>
your
sister
_
make
such
an
exhibition
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
certainly
not
.
"
  
"
to
walk
three
mile
,
or
four
mile
,
or
five
mile
,
or
whatever
it
be
,
above
her
ancle
in
dirt
,
and
alone
,
quite
alone
!
<EOS>
what
could
she
mean
by
it
?
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
to
shew
an
abominable
sort
of
conceited
independence
,
a
most
country
town
indifference
to
decorum
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
shew
an
affection
for
her
sister
that
be
very
pleasing
,
"
say
Bingley
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
,
Mr.
Darcy
,
"
observe
Miss
Bingley
,
in
a
half
whisper
,
"
that
this
adventure
have
rather
affect
your
admiration
of
her
fine
eye
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
at
all
,
"
he
reply
;
"
they
be
brighten
by
the
exercise
.
"
 
<EOS>
a
short
pause
follow
this
speech
,
and
Mrs.
Hurst
begin
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
an
excessive
regard
for
Jane
Bennet
,
she
be
really
a
very
sweet
girl
,
and
I
wish
with
all
my
heart
she
be
well
settle
.
<EOS>
but
with
such
a
father
and
mother
,
and
such
low
connection
,
I
be
afraid
there
be
no
chance
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
hear
you
say
,
that
their
uncle
be
an
attorney
in
Meryton
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
and
they
have
another
,
who
live
somewhere
near
Cheapside
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
capital
,
"
add
her
sister
,
and
they
both
laugh
heartily
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
they
have
uncle
enough
to
fill
_
all
_
Cheapside
,
"
cry
Bingley
,
"
it
would
not
make
them
one
jot
less
agreeable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
must
very
materially
lessen
their
chance
of
marry
man
of
any
consideration
in
the
world
,
"
reply
Darcy
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
speech
Bingley
make
no
answer
;
but
his
sister
give
it
their
hearty
assent
,
and
indulge
their
mirth
for
some
time
at
the
expense
of
their
dear
friend
's
vulgar
relation
.
  
<EOS>
with
a
renewal
of
tenderness
,
however
,
they
repair
to
her
room
on
leave
the
dining
-
parlour
,
and
sit
with
her
till
summon
to
coffee
.
<EOS>
She
be
still
very
poorly
,
and
Elizabeth
would
not
quit
her
at
all
,
till
late
in
the
evening
,
when
she
have
the
comfort
of
see
her
asleep
,
and
when
it
appear
to
her
rather
right
than
pleasant
that
she
should
go
down
stair
herself
.
<EOS>
on
enter
the
drawing
-
room
she
find
the
whole
party
at
loo
,
and
be
immediately
invite
to
join
them
;
but
suspect
them
to
be
play
high
<EOS>
she
decline
it
,
and
make
her
sister
the
excuse
,
say
she
would
amuse
herself
for
the
short
time
she
could
stay
below
with
a
book
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Hurst
look
at
her
with
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
prefer
read
to
card
?
"
say
he
;
"
that
be
rather
singular
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Eliza
Bennet
,
"
say
Miss
Bingley
,
"
despise
card
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
great
reader
and
have
no
pleasure
in
anything
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
deserve
neither
such
praise
nor
such
censure
,
"
cry
Elizabeth
;
<EOS>
"
I
be
_
not
_
a
great
reader
,
and
I
have
pleasure
in
many
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
nurse
your
sister
I
be
sure
you
have
pleasure
,
"
say
Bingley
;
"
and
I
hope
it
will
soon
be
increase
by
see
her
quite
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
thank
him
from
her
heart
,
and
then
walk
towards
a
table
where
a
few
book
be
lie
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
offer
to
fetch
her
other
;
all
that
his
library
afford
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
wish
my
collection
be
large
for
your
benefit
and
my
own
credit
;
but
I
be
an
idle
fellow
,
and
though
I
have
not
many
,
I
have
more
than
I
ever
look
into
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
assure
him
that
she
could
suit
herself
perfectly
with
those
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
astonish
,
"
say
Miss
Bingley
,
"
that
my
father
should
have
leave
so
small
a
collection
of
book
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
delightful
library
you
have
at
Pemberley
,
Mr.
Darcy
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
ought
to
be
good
,
"
he
reply
,
"
it
have
be
the
work
of
many
generation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
then
you
have
add
so
much
to
it
yourself
,
you
be
always
buy
book
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
comprehend
the
neglect
of
a
family
library
in
such
day
as
these
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Neglect
!
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
neglect
nothing
that
can
add
to
the
beauty
of
that
noble
place
.
<EOS>
Charles
,
when
you
build
_
your
_
house
,
I
wish
it
may
be
half
as
delightful
as
Pemberley
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
it
may
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
would
really
advise
you
to
make
your
purchase
in
that
neighbourhood
,
and
take
Pemberley
for
a
kind
of
model
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
fine
county
in
England
than
Derbyshire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
with
all
my
heart
;
I
will
buy
Pemberley
itself
if
Darcy
will
sell
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
talk
of
possibility
,
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
Caroline
,
I
should
think
it
more
possible
to
get
Pemberley
by
purchase
than
by
imitation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
so
much
catch
by
what
pass
,
as
to
leave
her
very
little
attention
for
her
book
;
and
soon
lay
it
wholly
aside
,
she
draw
near
the
card
-
table
,
and
station
herself
between
Mr.
Bingley
and
his
eld
sister
,
to
observe
the
game
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
Miss
Darcy
much
grow
since
the
spring
?
"
say
Miss
Bingley
;
"
will
she
be
as
tall
as
I
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
will
.
<EOS>
She
be
now
about
Miss
Elizabeth
Bennet
's
height
,
or
rather
tall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
I
long
to
see
her
again
!
<EOS>
I
never
meet
with
anybody
who
delight
me
so
much
.
<EOS>
such
a
countenance
,
such
manner
!
<EOS>
and
so
extremely
accomplished
for
her
age
!
<EOS>
Her
performance
on
the
piano
-
forte
be
exquisite

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
amazing
to
me
,
"
say
Bingley
,
"
how
young
lady
can
have
patience
to
be
so
very
accomplished
,
as
they
all
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
all
young

accomplish

<EOS>
My

Charles
,
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
all
of
them
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
They
all
paint
table
,
cover
skreen
and
net
purse
.
<EOS>
I
scarcely
know
any
one
who
can
not
do
all
this
,
and
I
be
sure
I
never
hear
a
young
lady
speak
of
for
the
first
time
,
without
be
inform
that
she
be
very
accomplished
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
list
of
the
common
extent
of
accomplishment
,
"
say
Darcy
,
"
have
too
much
truth
.
<EOS>
the
word
be
apply
to
many
a
woman
who
deserve
it
<EOS>
no
otherwise
than
by
net
a
purse
,
or
cover
a
skreen
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
very
far
from
agree
with
you
in
your
estimation
of
lady
in
general
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
boast
of
know
more
than
half
a
dozen
,
in
the
whole
range
of
my
acquaintance
,
that
be
really
accomplished

"
  
<EOS>
"
nor
I
,
I
be
sure
,
"
say
Miss
Bingley
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
"
observe
Elizabeth
,
"
you
must
comprehend
a
great
deal
in
your
idea
of
an
accomplished
woman

<EOS>
"
  
"
yes
;
I
do
comprehend
a
great
deal
in
it

oh

certainly

cry
his
faithful
assistant

"
<EOS>
no
one
can
be
really
esteem
accomplish
,
who
do
not
greatly
surpass
what

usually
meet
with

<EOS>
a
woman
must
have
a
thorough
knowledge
of
music
,
singing
,
drawing
,
dancing
,
and
the
modern
language
,
to
deserve
the
word
;
and
besides
all
this
,
she
must
possess
a
certain
something
in
her
air
and
manner
of
walk
,
the
tone
of
her
voice
,
her
address
and
expression
,

the
word
will
be

half
deserved

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
all
this
she
must
possess
,
"
add
Darcy
,
"
and
to
all
this
she
must
yet
add
something
more
substantial
,
in
the
improvement
of
her
mind
by
extensive
reading
.
<EOS>

<EOS>

I
be
no

surprised
at

now
at

you

severe
upon

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hurst
and
Miss
Bingley
both
cry
out
against
the
injustice
of
her
implied
doubt
,
and
be
both
protest
that
they
know
many
woman
who
answer
this
description
,
when
Mr.
Hurst
call
them
to
order
,
with
bitter
complaint
of
their
inattention
to
what
be
go
forward

as
all
conversation
be
thereby
at
an
end

Elizabeth
soon
afterwards
leave
the
room

undervalue
their

with
many
man
,
I
dare
say

it
succeed
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
my
opinion

it
be
a
paltry
device
,
a
very
mean
art

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
undoubtedly
,
"
reply
Darcy
,
to
whom
this
remark
be
chiefly
address
,
"
there
be
meanness
in
_
<EOS>
all
_
<EOS>
the
art
which
lady
sometimes
condescend
to
employ
for
captivation
.
<EOS>
whatever
bear
affinity
to
cunning
be
despicable
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Bingley
be
not
so
entirely
satisfied
with
this
reply
as
to
continue
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
join
them
again
only
to
say
that
her
sister
be
bad
,
and
that
she
could
not
leave
her
.
<EOS>
Bingley
urge
Mr.
Jones
's
be
send
for
immediately
;
while
his
sister
,
convince
that
no
country
advice
could
be
of
any
service
,
recommend
an
express
to
town
for
one
of
the
most
eminent
physician
.
<EOS>
this
,
she
would
not
hear
of
;
but
she
be
not
so
unwilling
to
comply
with
their
brother
's
proposal
;
and
it
be
settle
that
Mr.
Jones
should
be
send
for
early
in
the
morning
,
if
Miss
Bennet
be
not
decidedly
well
.
<EOS>
Bingley
be
quite
uncomfortable
;
his
sister
declare
that
they
be
miserable
.
<EOS>
They
solace
their
wretchedness
,
however
,
by
duet
after
supper
,
while
he
could
find
no
well
relief
to
his
feeling
than
by
give
his
housekeeper
direction
that
every
possible
attention
may
be
pay
to
the
sick
lady
and
her
sister

<EOS>
Elizabeth
pass
the
chief
of
the
night
in
her
sister
's
room
,
and
in
the
morning
have
the
pleasure
of
be
able
to
send
a
tolerable
answer
to
the
enquiry
which
she
very
early
receive
from
Mr.
Bingley
by
a
housemaid
,
and
some
time
afterwards
from
the
two
elegant
lady
who
wait
on
his
sister
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
this
amendment
,
however
,
she
request
to
have
a
note
send
to
Longbourn
,
desire
her
mother
to
visit
Jane
,
and
form
her
own
judgment
of
her
situation

the
note
be

content
as
quickly

by
her
two
young
girl

reach
Netherfield
soon
after
the
family
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
have
she
find
Jane
in
any
apparent
danger
,
Mrs.
Bennet
would
have
be
very
miserable
;
but
be
satisfied
on
see
her
that
her
illness
be
not
alarming
,
she
have
no
wish
of
her
recover
immediately
,
as
her
restoration
to
health
would
probably
remove
her
from
Netherfield
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
listen
therefore
to
her
daughter
's
proposal
of
be
carry
home
;
neither
do
the
apothecary
,
who
arrive
about
the
same
time
,
think
it
at
all
advisable

<EOS>
after
sit
a
little
while
with
Jane
,
on
Miss
Bingley
's
appearance
and
invitation
,
the
mother

them
with
hope

She

Mr.

You

Mrs.

I

she
add
,
"
if
it
be
not
for
such
good
friend
I
do
not
know
what

a
vast
deal

with
the
great
patience

nothing

<EOS>
You
have
a
sweet
room
here

Mr.

a
charming
prospect

that
gravel
walk

<EOS>
I
do
not
know
a

equal

Netherfield

You
will
not

a
short

whatever

he

Netherfield

I
should
probably
be
off

at

indeed

Mrs.

I

every

after
look

for

turn
silently
away

Mrs.

,
who
fancy
she
have
gain
a
complete
victory

continue
her
triumph

I
can
not
see
that
London
have
any

the

public

the

Mr.

"
when
I

he

I
never

when
I
be

it
be
pretty
much
the

They
have
each
their
advantage

I
can
be
equally
happy

<EOS>
"
aye
 
that

you
have

indeed

Mama

you
be
mistaken

Elizabeth

blush
for
her

<EOS>
"
You
quite
mistake
Mr.

.
<EOS>
He
only
mean
that
there
be
not
such
a
variety
of
people
to
be
meet
with

the
country

in

you

true

"
  
<EOS>

certainly
,
my

nobody
say
there
be

as

I
believe
there
be
few
neighbourhood
large

I
know
we
dine

twenty
family

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
nothing
but
concern
for
Elizabeth
could
enable
Bingley
to
keep
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
His
sister
be
less
delicate
,
and
direct
her
eye
towards
Mr.
Darcy
with
a
very
expressive
smile
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
,
for
the
sake
of
say
something
that
may
turn
her
mother
's
thought
,
now
ask
her
if
Charlotte
Lucas
have
be
at
Longbourn
since

away

yes
,
she
call
yesterday

what
an
agreeable
man
Sir
William

Mr.

<EOS>
so
much
the
man

<EOS>
so
genteel

so
easy

<EOS>
He
have
always
something
to
say
to
every
body

<EOS>
_
<EOS>
that

be
my
idea

good
breeding

those
person
who
fancy
themselves
very
important

quite
mistake
the
matter

"
  
<EOS>
"
do
Charlotte
dine
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
she
would
go
home
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
she
be
want
about
the
mince
pie
.
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
Mr.
Bingley
,
_
I
_
always
keep
servant
that
can
do
their
own
work
;
_
my

daughter
be
bring
up
differently

<EOS>
but
every
body
be
to
judge
for
themselves
,
and
the
lucas
be
very
good
sort
of
girl
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
they
be
not
handsome
!
<EOS>
not
that
_
<EOS>
I
_
think
<EOS>
Charlotte
<EOS>
so
_
<EOS>
very
_
<EOS>
plain
 
<EOS>
but
then
she
be
our
particular
friend

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
seem
a
very
pleasant
young
woman
,
"
say
Bingley
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
<EOS>
dear
,
yes
;
 
<EOS>
but
you
must
own
<EOS>
she
be
very
plain
.
<EOS>
Lady
Lucas
herself
have
often
say
so
,
and
envy
me
Jane
's
beauty
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
to
boast
of
my
own
child
,

to
be
sure
,
Jane
 
one
do
not
often
see
any
body
better
look
.
<EOS>
It
be
what
every
body
say
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
trust
my
own
partiality
.
<EOS>
when
she
be
only
fifteen
,
there
be
a
gentleman
at
my
brother
Gardiner
's
in
town
,
so
much
in
love
with
her
,
that
my
sister
-
in
-
law
be
sure
he
would
make
her
an
offer
before
we
come
away
.
<EOS>
but
however
he
do
not
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
think
her
too
young
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
write
some
verse
on
her
,
and
very
pretty
they
be
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
so
end
his
affection
,
"
say
Elizabeth
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
there
have
be
many
a
one
,
I
fancy
,
overcome
in
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
who
first
discover
the
efficacy
of
poetry
in
drive
away
love
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
use
to
consider
poetry
as
the
_
food
_
of
love
,
"
say
Darcy
.
  
<EOS>
"
of
a
fine
,
stout
,
healthy
love
it
may
.
<EOS>
every
thing
nourish
what
be
strong
already
.
<EOS>
but
if
it
be
only
a
slight
,
thin
sort
of
inclination
,
I
be
convinced
that
one
good
sonnet
will
starve
it
entirely
away
.
"
  
<EOS>
Darcy
only
smile
;
and
the
general
pause
which
ensue
make
Elizabeth
tremble
lest
her
mother
should
be
expose
herself
again
.
<EOS>
She
long
to
speak
,
but
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
;
and
after
a
short
silence
Mrs.
Bennet
begin
repeat
her
thank
to
Mr.
Bingley
for
his
kindness
to
Jane
,
with
an
apology
for
trouble
him
also
with
Lizzy
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bingley
be
unaffectedly
civil
in
his
answer
,
and
force
his
young
sister
to
be
civil
also
,
and
say
what
the
occasion
require
.
<EOS>
She
perform
her
part
indeed
without
much
graciousness
,
but
Mrs.
Bennet
be
satisfied
,
and
soon
afterwards
order
her
carriage
.
<EOS>
upon
this
signal
,
the
young
of
her
daughter
put
herself
forward
.
<EOS>
the
two
girl
have
be
whisper
to
each
other
during
the
whole
visit
,
and
the
result
of
it
be
,
that
the
young
should
tax
Mr.
Bingley
with
have
promise
on
his
first
come
into
the
country
to
give
a
ball
at
Netherfield
.
  
<EOS>
Lydia
be
a
stout
,
well
-
grow
girl
of
fifteen
,
with
a
fine
complexion
and
good
-
humoured
countenance
;
a
favourite
with
her
mother
,
whose
affection
have
bring
her
into
public
at
an
early
age
.
<EOS>
She
have
high
animal
spirit
,
and
a
sort
of
natural
self
-
consequence
,
which
the
attention
of
the
officer
,
to
whom
her
uncle
's
good
dinner
and
her
own
easy
manner
recommend
her
,
have
increase
into
assurance
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
equal
therefore
to
address
Mr.
Bingley
on
the
subject
of
the
ball
,
and
abruptly
remind
him
of
his
promise
;
add
,
that
it
would
be
the
most
shameful
thing
in
the
world
if
he
do
not
keep
it
.
<EOS>
His
answer
to
this
sudden
attack
be
delightful
to
their
mother
's
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
perfectly
ready
,
I
assure
you

to
keep
my
engagement

and
when
your
sister
be
recover
,
you
shall
if
you
please
name
the
very
day
of
the
ball
.

but
you
would
not
wish

be
dance
while
she
be
ill

<EOS>
Lydia
declare
herself
satisfied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
 
it
would
be
much
well
to
wait
till
Jane
be
well
,
and
by
that
time
most
likely
Captain
Carter
would
be
at
Meryton
again
.
<EOS>
and
when
you
have
give
_
your
_
ball
,
"
she
add
,
"
I
shall
insist
on
their
give
one

I

Mrs.

depart
,

My

I

not

Your
humility
,
Mr.
Bingley
,
"
say
Elizabeth
,
"
must
disarm
reproof
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
be
more
deceitful
,
"
say
Darcy
,
"
than
the
appearance
of
humility
.
<EOS>
It
be
often
only
carelessness
of
opinion
,
and
sometimes
an
indirect
boast
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
which
of
the
two
do
you
call
_
<EOS>
my
_
little
recent
piece
of
modesty
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
indirect
boast
;
 
for
you
be
really
proud
of
your
defect
in
writing
,
because
you
consider
them
as
proceed
from
a
rapidity
of
thought
and
carelessness
of
execution
,
which
if
not
estimable
,
you
think
at
least
highly
interesting
.
<EOS>
the
power
of
do
any
thing
with
quickness
be
always
much
prize
by
the
possessor
,
and
often
without
any
attention
to
the
imperfection
of
the
performance
.
<EOS>
when
you
tell
Mrs.
Bennet
this
morning
that
if
you
ever
resolve
on
quit
Netherfield
you
should
be
go
in
five
minute
,
you
mean
it
to
be
a
sort
of
panegyric
,
of
compliment
to
yourself
 
<EOS>
and
yet
what
be
there
so
very
laudable
in
a
precipitance
which
must
leave
very
necessary
business
undone
,
and
can
be
of
no
real
advantage
to
yourself
or
any
one
else
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
cry
Bingley
,
"
this
be
too
much
,
to
remember
at
night
all
the
foolish
thing
that
be
say
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
believe
what
I
say
of
myself
to
be
true
,
and
I
believe
it
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
at
least
,
therefore
,
I
do
not
assume
the
character
of
needless
precipitance
merely
to
shew
off
before
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
you
believe
it
;
but
I
be
by
no
mean
convinced
that
you
would
be
go
with
such
celerity
.
<EOS>
Your
conduct
would
be
quite
as
dependant
on
chance
as
that
of
any
man
I
know
;
and
if
,
as
you
be
mount
your
horse
,
a
friend
be
to
say
,
"
Bingley
,
you
have
well
stay
till
next
week

you
would
probably
do
it
,
you
would
probably
not
go
 
and
,
at
another
word
,
may
stay
a
month
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
only
prove
by
this
,
"
cry
Elizabeth
,
"
that
Mr.
Bingley
do
not
do
justice
to
his
own
disposition
.
<EOS>
You
have
shew
him
off
now
much
more
than
he
do
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
exceedingly
gratified
,
"
say
Bingley
,
"
by
your
converting
what
my
friend
say
into
a
compliment
on
the
sweetness
of
my
temper
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
afraid
you
be
give
it
a
turn
which
that
gentleman
do
by
no
means
intend
;
for
he
would
certainly
think
the
well
of
me
,
if
under
such
a
circumstance
I
be
to
give
a
flat
denial
,
and
ride
off
as
fast
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
Mr.
Darcy
then
consider
the
rashness
of
your
original
intention
as
atone
for
by
your
obstinacy
in
adhere
to
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
I
can
not
exactly
explain
the
matter
,
Darcy
must
speak
for
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
expect
me
to
account
for
opinion
which
you
chuse
to
call
mine
,
but
which
I
have
never
acknowledge
.
<EOS>
allow
the
case
,
however
,
to
stand
accord
to
your
representation
,
you
must
remember
,
Miss
Bennet
,
that
the
friend
who
be
suppose
to
desire
his
return
to
the
house
,
and
the
delay
of
his
plan
,
have
merely
desire
it
,
ask
it
without
offer
one
argument
in
favour
of
its
propriety
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
to
yield
readily
 
easily
 
to
the
_
persuasion
_
of
a
friend
be
no
merit
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
to
yield
without
conviction
be
no
compliment
to
the
understanding
of
either
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
appear
to
me
,
Mr.
Darcy
,
to
allow
nothing
for
the
influence
of
friendship
and
affection
.
<EOS>
a
regard
for
the
requester
would
often
make
one
readily
yield
to
a
request
,
without
wait
for
argument
to
reason
one
into
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
particularly
speak
of
such
a
case
as
you
have
suppose
about
Mr.
Bingley
.
<EOS>
We
may
as
well
wait
,
perhaps
,
till
the
circumstance
occur
,
before
we
discuss
the
discretion
of
his
behaviour
thereupon
.
<EOS>
but
in
general
and
ordinary
case
between
friend
and
friend
,
where
one
of
them
be
desire
by
the
other
to
change
a
resolution
of
no
very
great
moment
,
should
you
think
ill
of
that
person
for
comply
with
the
desire
,
without
wait
to
be
argue
into
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Will
it
not
be
advisable
,
before
we
proceed
on
this
subject
,
to
arrange
with
rather
more
precision
the
degree
of
importance
which
be
to
appertain
to
this
request
,
as
well
as
the
degree
of
intimacy
subsist
between
the
party

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
by
all
mean
,
"
cry
Bingley
;
"
let
us
hear
all
the
particular
,
not
forget
their
comparative
height
and
size
;
for
that
will
have
more
weight
in
the
argument
,
Miss
Bennet
,
than
you
may
be
aware
of
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
that
if
Darcy
be
not
such
a
great
tall
fellow
,
in
comparison
with
myself
,
I
should
not
pay
him
half
so
much
deference
.
<EOS>
I
declare
I
do
not
know
a
more
aweful
object
than
Darcy
,
on
particular
occasion
,
and
in
particular
place
;
at
his
own
house
especially
,
and
of
a
Sunday
evening
when
he
have
nothing
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
smile
;
but
Elizabeth
think
she
could
perceive
that
he
be
rather
offend
;
and
therefore
check
her
laugh
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bingley
warmly
resent
the
indignity
he
have
receive
,
in
an
expostulation
with
her
brother
for
talk
such
nonsense
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
your
design
,
Bingley
,
"
say
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
dislike
an
argument
,
and
want
to
silence
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
do
.
<EOS>
argument
be
too
much
like
dispute
.
<EOS>
if
you
and
Miss
Bennet
will
defer
yours
till
I
be
out
of
the
room
,
I
shall
be
very
thankful
;
and
then
you
may
say
whatever
you
like
of
me

"
  
<EOS>
"
what
you
ask
,
"
say
Elizabeth
,
"
be
no
sacrifice
on
my
side
;
and
Mr.
Darcy
have
much
well
finish
his
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
take
her
advice
,
and
do
finish
his
letter
.
  
<EOS>
when
that
business
be
over
,
he
apply
to
Miss
Bingley
and
Elizabeth
for
the
indulgence
of
some
music
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bingley
move
with
alacrity
to
the
piano
-
forte
,
and
after
a
polite
request
that
Elizabeth
would
lead
the
way
,
which
the
other
as
politely
and
more
earnestly
negative
,
she
seat
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hurst
sing
with
her
sister
,
and
while
they
be
thus
employ
<EOS>
Elizabeth
could
not
help
observe
as
she
turn
over
some
music
book
that
lie
on
the
instrument
,
how
frequently
Mr.
Darcy
's
eye
be
fix
on
her
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
know
how
to
suppose
that
she
could
be
an
object
of
admiration
to
so
great
a
man
;
and
yet
that
he
should
look
at
her
because
he
dislike
her
,
be
still
more
strange
.
<EOS>
She
could
only
imagine
however
at
last
,
that
she
draw
his
notice
because
there
be
a
something
about
her
more
wrong
and
reprehensible
,
accord
to
his
idea
of
right
,
than
in
any
other
person
present
.
<EOS>
the
supposition
do
not
pain
her
.
<EOS>
She
like
him
too
little
to
care
for
his
approbation
.
  
<EOS>
after
play
some
italian
song
,
Miss
Bingley
vary
the
charm
by
a
lively
Scotch
air
;
and
soon
afterwards
Mr.
Darcy
,
draw
near
Elizabeth
,
say
to
her
    
"
<EOS>
do
not
you
feel
a
great
inclination
,
Miss
Bennet
,
to
seize
such
an
opportunity
of
dance
a
reel
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
smile
,
but
make
no
answer
.
<EOS>
He
repeat
the
question
,
with
some
surprise
at
her
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
she
,
"
I
hear
you
before
;
but
I
could
not
immediately
determine
what
to
say
in
reply
.
<EOS>
You
want
me
,
I
know
,
to
say
"
yes
,
"
that
you
may
have
the
pleasure
of
despise
my
taste
;
but
I
always
delight
in
overthrow
those
kind
of
scheme
,
and
cheat
a
person
of
their
premeditate
contempt
.
<EOS>
I
have
therefore
make
up
my
mind
to
tell
you
,
that
I
do
not
want
to
dance
a
reel
at
all
 
and
now
despise
me
if
you
dare
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
do
not
dare
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
,
have
rather
expect
to
affront
him
,
be
amazed
at
his
gallantry
;
but
there
be
a
mixture
of
sweetness
and
archness
in
her
manner
which
make
it
difficult
for
her
to
affront
anybody
;
and
Darcy
have
never
be
so
bewitch
by
any
woman
as
he
be
by
her
.
<EOS>
He
really
believe
,
that
be
it
not
for
the
inferiority
of
her
connection
,
he
should
be
in
some
danger
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Bingley
see
,
or
suspect
enough
to
be
jealous
;
and
her
great
anxiety
for
the
recovery
of
her
dear
friend
Jane
,
receive
some
assistance
from
her
desire
of
get
rid
of
Elizabeth
.
  
<EOS>
She
often
try
to
provoke
Darcy
into
dislike
her
guest
,
by
talk
of
their
suppose
marriage
,
and
plan
his
happiness
in
such
an
alliance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
say
she
,
as
they
be
walk
together
in
the
shrubbery
the
next
day
,
"
you
will
give
your
mother
-
in
-
law
a
few
hint
,
when
this
desirable
event
take
place
,
as
to
the
advantage
of
hold
her
tongue
;
and
if
you
can
compass
it
,
do
cure
the
young
girl
of
run
after
the
officer
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
if
I
may
mention
so
delicate
a
subject
,
endeavour
to
check
that
little
something
,
border
on
conceit
and
impertinence
,
which
your
lady
possess
.
<EOS>

"
have
you
any
thing
else
to
propose
for
my
domestic
felicity

"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
do
let
the
portrait
of
your
uncle
and
aunt
Philips
be
place
in
the
gallery
at
Pemberley

put
them
next
to
your
great
uncle
the
judge

<EOS>
They
be
in
the
same
profession

you
know
;
only
in
different
line

<EOS>
as
for
your
Elizabeth
's
picture
,
you
must
not
attempt
to
have
it
take
,
for
what
painter
could
do
justice
to
those
beautiful
eye
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
not
be
easy
,
indeed
,
to
catch
their
expression
,
but
their
colour
and
shape
,
and
the
eye
-
lash
,
so
remarkably
fine

may
be
copy

"
  
<EOS>
at
that
moment
they
be
meet
from
another
walk
,
by
Mrs.
Hurst
and
Elizabeth
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
you
intend
to
walk
,
"
say
Miss
Bingley
,
in
some
confusion
,
lest
they
have
be
overhear
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
use
us
abominably
ill
,
"
answer
Mrs.
Hurst
,
"
in
run
away
without
tell
us
that

out

"
  
<EOS>
then
take
the
disengaged
arm
of
Mr.
Darcy
,
she
leave
Elizabeth
to
walk
by
herself
.
<EOS>
the
path
just
admit
three
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
feel
their
rudeness
and
immediately
say
,
    
"
this
walk
be
not
wide
enough
for
our
party
.
<EOS>
We
have
better
go
into
the
avenue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
Elizabeth
,
who
have
not
the
least
inclination
to
remain
with
them
,
laughingly
answer
,
  
"
<EOS>
no
,
no
;
stay
where
you
be
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
charmingly
group'd
,
and
appear
to
uncommon
advantage
.
<EOS>
the
picturesque
would
be
spoil
by
admit
a
fourth
.
<EOS>
good
bye
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
then
run
gaily
off
,
rejoice
as
she
ramble
about
,
in
the
hope
of
be
at
home
again
in
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
Jane
be
already
so
much
recover
as
to
intend
leave
her
room
for
a
couple
of
hour
that
evening
.
    
<EOS>
when
the
lady
remove
after
dinner
,
Elizabeth
run
up
to
her
sister
,
and
see
her
well
guard
from
cold
,
attend
her
into
the
drawing
-
room
;
where
she
be
welcome
by
her
two
friend
with
many
profession
of
pleasure
;
and
Elizabeth
have
never
see
them
so
agreeable
as
they
be
during
the
hour
which
pass
before
the
gentleman
appear
.
<EOS>
Their
power
of
conversation
be
considerable
.
<EOS>
They
could
describe
an
entertainment
with
accuracy
,
relate
an
anecdote
with
humour
,
and
laugh
at
their
acquaintance
with
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
the
gentleman
enter
,
Jane
be
no
longer
the
first
object
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bingley
's
eye
be
instantly
turn
towards
Darcy
,
and
she
have
something
to
say
to
him
before
he
have
advance
many
step
.
<EOS>
He
address
himself
directly
to
Miss
Bennet
,
with
a
polite
congratulation
;
Mr.
Hurst
also
make
her
a
slight
bow
,
and
say
he
be
"
very
glad
;
"
but
diffuseness
and
warmth
remain
for
Bingley
's
salutation
.
<EOS>
He
be
full
of
joy
and
attention
.
<EOS>
the
first
half
hour
be
spend
in
pile
up
the
fire
,
lest
she
should
suffer
from
the
change
of
room
;
and
she
remove
at
his
desire
to
the
other
side
of
the
fire
-
place
,
that
she
may
be
farth
from
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
then
sit
down
by
her
,
and
talk
scarcely
to
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
,
at
work
in
the
opposite
corner
,
see
it
all
with
great
delight
.
  
<EOS>
when
tea
be
over
,
Mr.
Hurst
remind
his
sister
-
in
-
law
of
the
card
-
table
 
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
She
have
obtain
private
intelligence
that
Mr.
Darcy
do
not
wish
for
card
;
and
Mr.
Hurst
soon
find
even
his
open
petition
reject
.
<EOS>
She
assure
him
that
no
one
intend
to
play
,
and
the
silence
of
the
whole
party
on
the
subject

to
justify
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Hurst
have
therefore
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
stretch
himself
on
one
of
the
sophas
and
go
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
Darcy
take
up
a
book
;
Miss
Bingley
do
the
same
;
and
Mrs.
Hurst
,
principally
occupy
in
play
with
her
bracelet
and
ring
,
join
now
and
then
in
her
brother
's
conversation
with
Miss
Bennet
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Bingley
's
attention
be
quite
as
much
engage
in
watch
Mr.
Darcy
's
progress
through
_
his
_
book
,
as
in
read
her
own
;
and
she
be
perpetually
either
make
some
inquiry
,
or
look
at
his
page
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
win
him
,
however
,
to
any
conversation
;
he
merely
answer
her
question
,
and
read
on
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
quite
exhausted
by
the
attempt
to
be
amuse
with
her
own
book
,
which
she
have
only
choose
because
it
be
the
second
volume
of
his
,
she
give
a
great
yawn
and
say
,
"
how
pleasant
it
be
to
spend
an
evening
in
this
way
!
<EOS>
I
declare
after
all
there
be
no
enjoyment
like
read
!
<EOS>
how
much
sooner
one
tire
of
any
thing
than
of
a
book
!
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
a
house
of
my
own
,
I
shall
be
miserable
if
I
have
not
an
excellent
library
.
"
  
<EOS>
no
one
make
any
reply
.
<EOS>
She
then
yawn
again
,
throw
aside
her
book
,
and
cast
her
eye
round
the
room
in
quest
of
some
amusement
;
when
hear
her
brother
mention
a
ball
to
Miss
Bennet
,
she
turn
suddenly
towards
him
and
say
,
  
"
<EOS>
by
the
bye
,
Charles
,
be
you
really
serious
in
meditate
a
dance
at
Netherfield
?
 
<EOS>
I
would
advise
you
,
before
you
determine
on
it
,
to
consult
the
wish
of
the
present
party
;
I
be
much
mistake
if
there
be
not
some
among
us
to
whom
a
ball
would
be
rather
a
punishment
than
a
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
mean
Darcy
,
"
cry
her
brother
,
"
he
may
go
to
bed
,
if
he
chuse
,
before
it
begin
 
but
as
for
the
ball
,
it
be
quite
a
settle
thing
;
and
as
soon
as
Nicholls
have
make
white
soup
enough
I
shall
send
round
my
card
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
ball
infinitely
better
,
"
she
reply
,
"
if
they
be
carry
on
in
a
different
manner
;
but
there
be
something
insufferably
tedious
in
the
usual
process
of
such
a
meeting
.
<EOS>
It
would
surely
be
much
more
rational
if
conversation
instead
of
dancing
make
the
order
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
much
more
rational
,
my
dear
Caroline
,
I
dare
say
,
but
it
would
not
be
near
so
much
like
a
ball
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Bingley
make
no
answer
;
and
soon
afterwards
get
up
and
walk
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
Her
figure
be
elegant
,
and
she
walk
well
;
 
but
Darcy
,
at
whom
it
be
all
aim
,
be
still
inflexibly
studious
.
<EOS>
in
the
desperation
of
her
feeling
she
resolve
on
one
effort
more
;
and
,
turn
to
Elizabeth
,
say
,
  
"
Miss
Eliza
Bennet
,
let
me
persuade
you
to
follow
my
example
,
and
take
a
turn
about
the
room

<EOS>
I
assure
you
it
be
very
refreshing
after
sit
so
long
in
one
attitude

"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
surprised
,
but
agree
to
it
immediately
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bingley
succeed
no
less
in
the
real
object
of
her
civility
;
Mr.
Darcy
look
up
.
<EOS>
He
be
as
much
awake
to
the
novelty
of
attention
in
that
quarter
as
Elizabeth
herself
could
be
,
and
unconsciously
close
his
book
.
<EOS>
He
be
directly
invite
to
join
their
party
,
but
he
decline
it
,
observe
,
that
he
could
imagine
but
two

for
their
chusing
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
together

with
either
of
which
motive
<EOS>
his
join
them
would
interfere

"
what
could
he
mean
?
<EOS>
she
be
die
to
know
what
could
be
his
meaning
<EOS>

and
ask
Elizabeth
whether
she
could
at
all
understand
him
?
  
<EOS>
"
not
at
all
,
"
be
her
answer
;
"
but
depend
upon
it
,
he
mean
to
be
severe
on
us
,
and
our
sure
way
of
disappoint
him
,
will
be
to
ask
nothing
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Bingley
,
however
,
be
incapable
of
disappoint
Mr.
Darcy
in
any
thing
,
and
persevere
therefore
in
require
an
explanation
of
his
two
motive
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
small
objection
to
explain
them

he
,
as
soon
as
she
allow
him
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
You
either
chuse
this
method
of
pass
the
evening
because
you
be
in
each
other

confidence

have
secret
affair
to
discuss

because
you
be
conscious
that
your

yes

Your
examination

over

I

say
Miss
Bingley
;

and
pray
what
be
the
result
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
perfectly
convince

it

no

I

<EOS>
I
have
fault
enough

they

not

I

of
understanding

<EOS>
My
temper
I
dare
not

<EOS>
It
be
<EOS>
I
believe
too
little

certainly
too

I

folly

My

Her

the

forte
be
open

and
Darcy
,
after
a
few
moment
recollection
,
be
not
sorry
for
it

<EOS>
He
begin
to
feel
the
danger
of
pay
Elizabeth
too
much
attention
.
    
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
an
agreement
between
the
sister
,
Elizabeth
write
the
next
morning
to
her
mother
,
to
beg
that
the
carriage
may
be
send
for
them
in
the
course

the
day

<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Bennet

who

calculate
on

daughter
remain
at
Netherfield
till
the
follow
Tuesday

which
would
exactly
finish
Jane

week

Her
answer

therefore

be
not
propitious

at

not

get
home

<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
send
them
word
that
they
could
not
possibly
have
the
carriage
before
Tuesday
;
and
in
her
postscript
it
be
add
,
that
if
Mr.
Bingley
and
his
sister
press
them
to
stay
longer
,
she
could
spare
them
very
well

against
stay

Elizabeth
be
positively
resolve

ask

fearful
,
on
the
contrary

as
be
consider
as
intrude
themselves
needlessly
long
,
she
urge
Jane
to
borrow
Mr.
Bingley
's
carriage
immediately
,

at
length
it
be
settle
that
their
original
design
of
leave
Netherfield
that
morning
should
be
mention

the
request
make
.

communication
excite
many

going

<EOS>
Miss
Bingley
be
then
sorry
that
she
have
propose
the
delay

for
her
jealousy

dislike

much
exceed
her
affection

the
master
of
the

hear
with
real
sorrow
that

to
go
so
soon

repeatedly
try
to
persuade
Miss

that
it
would
not
be
safe
for

that
she
be
not

recover

Jane
be
firm
where

to
Mr.

intelligence

be
at

long
enough

She
attract
him
more
than
he
like
 
and
Miss
Bingley
be
uncivil
to
_
her
_
,
and
more
teazing
than
usual
to
himself

<EOS>
He
wisely
resolve
to
be
particularly
careful
that
no

of
admiration
should
_
now
_
escape
him

nothing
that
could
elevate
her
with
the
hope
of
influence
his
felicity

sensible
that
if
such
an
idea
have
be
suggest

his
behaviour
during
the
last
day
must
have
material
weight
in
confirm

crush
it

<EOS>
steady
to
his
purpose
,
he
scarcely
speak
ten
word
to
her
through
the
whole
of
Saturday
,
and
though
they
be
at
one
time
leave
by
themselves
for
half
an
hour
,
he
adhere
most
conscientiously
to
his
book

would
not
even
look
at
her
.

on
Sunday
,
after
morning
service

the
separation

so
agreeable

place

Miss
Bingley
's
civility
to
Elizabeth
increase
at
last
very
rapidly
,
as
well
as
her
affection
for
Jane
;
and
when
they
part
,
after
assure
the
latter
of
the
pleasure
it
would
always
give
her
to
see
her
either
at
Longbourn
or
Netherfield
,
and
embrace
her
most
tenderly
,
she
even
shake
hand
with
the
former

Elizabeth
take
leave
of
the
whole
party
in
the
lively
spirit

They
be
not
welcome
home
very
cordially
by
their
mother

<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
wonder
at
their
come
,
and
think
them
very
wrong
to
give
so
much
trouble
,
and
be
sure
Jane
would
have
catch
cold
again
.
 
<EOS>
but
their
father
,
though
very
laconic
in
his
expression
of
pleasure

be
really
glad
to
see
them
;
he
have
feel
their
importance
in
the
family
circle

<EOS>
the
evening
conversation
,
when
they
be
all
assemble
,
have
lose
much
of
its
animation
,
and
almost
all
its
sense
,
by
the
absence
of
Jane
and
Elizabeth
.
  
<EOS>
They
find
Mary
,
as
usual
,
deep
in
the
study
of
thorough
bass
and
human
nature
;
and
have
some
new
extract
to
admire
,
and
some
new
observation
of
thread
-
bare
morality
to
listen
to
.
<EOS>
Catherine
and
Lydia
have
information
for
them
of
a
different
sort

<EOS>
much
have
be

I
do
think
it
be
the
hard
thing
in

that
your
estate
should
be
entail
away

I

Jane

explain
to
her
the
nature
of
an
entail

<EOS>
They
have
often
attempt
it
before
,
but
it
be
a
subject
on
which
Mrs.
Bennet
be
beyond
the
reach
of
reason
;
and
she
continue
to
rail
bitterly
against
the
cruelty
of
settle
an
estate
away
from
a
family
of
five
daughter

in
favour
of
a
man

nobody
care
anything
about

<EOS>
"
It
certainly
be
a
most
iniquitous
affair

Mr.

and
nothing
can
clear
Mr.

from
the
guilt
of
inherit
Longbourn

<EOS>
but
if
you
will
listen
to
his
letter

you
may
perhaps
be
a
little
soften
by
his
manner

express
himself

no

that
I
be

I

not
;

I
think
it

very
impertinent
of
him

write
to
you
at
all

very
hypocritical

I
hate
such
false
friend

could

<EOS>
the
disagreement
subsist
between

always

me
much
uneasiness
,
and
since
I
have
have

I
have
frequently
wish
to
heal
the
breach

for

I
be
keep
back
by
my

doubt

fear
lest
it

disrespectful

My
mind
however
be
now
make
up
on

have

widow

as

on
these
ground
I
flatter
myself
that
my

are
highly
commendable
,

that
the
circumstance
of

will
be
kindly
overlook
on

Mr.

indeed
say
little

the

Mr.

seem
neither
in
need

encouragement

inclined
to
be
silent

He

heavy

twenty

so
fine
a

he
have
hear
much

that

in

all

furniture
be
examine

praise

his
commendation
of
every
thing
would
have
touch
Mrs.
Bennet

heart

but
for
the
mortifying
supposition
of
his
view
it
all
as
his
own
future
property
.
<EOS>
the
dinner
too
in
its
turn
be
highly
admire

he
beg
to
know
to
which
of
his
fair

the
excellence
of
its
cookery
be
owe

here
he
be
set
right
by
Mrs.

assure
him
with
some
asperity
that
they

very
well
able

have
nothing

beg
pardon

displease

softened
tone

declare
herself

about
a
quarter
of
an
hour

scarcely
speak
at
all

when

servant
be
withdraw

he
think
it
time
to
have
some
conversation
with
his
guest

and
therefore
start
a
subject
in
which
he
expect
him
to
shine
,
by
observe

he
seem
very
fortunate

the
subject
elevate
him
to
more
than
usual
solemnity

manner

with
a
most
important
aspect
he
protest
that
he
have
never
in
his
life
witness
such
behaviour
in
a
person
of
rank
 
such
affability

condescension

experience

both
the
discourse

the
honour

have
also
ask
him
twice

dine

send
for

only
the
Saturday
before

make
up

pool

in

evening

proud

never

affability
in
her

<EOS>
She
have
always
speak
to
him
as
she
would
to
any
other
gentleman

she
make
not
the
small
objection
to
his
joining

the
society

to
his
leave
his
parish
occasionally
for
a
week

two

to
visit
his

She
have
even
condescend
to
advise
him
to
marry
as
soon

could

provide

choose
with
discretion

and
have
once
pay
him
a
visit
in
his
humble
parsonage

where
she
have
perfectly
approve
all
the
alteration
he
have
be
make

have
even
vouchsafe
to
suggest
some
herself

some
shelf
in

"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
cry
Mrs.
Bennet
,
shake
her
head
,
"
<EOS>
then
she
be
well
off
than
many
girl
.
<EOS>
and
what
sort
of
young
lady
be
she
?
<EOS>
be
she
handsome
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
a
most
charming
young
lady
indeed
.
<EOS>
Lady
Catherine
herself
say
that
in
point
of
true
beauty
,
Miss
De
Bourgh
be
far
superior
to
the
handsome
of
her
sex
;
because
there
be
that
in
her
feature
which
mark
the
young
woman
of
distinguished
birth
.
<EOS>
She
be
unfortunately
of
a
sickly
constitution
,
which
have
prevent
her
make
that
progress
in
many
accomplishment
,
which
she
could
not
otherwise
have
fail
of
;
as
I
be
inform
by
the
lady
who
superintend
her
education
,
and
who
still
reside
with
them
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
perfectly
amiable
,
and
often
condescend
to
drive
by
my
humble
abode
in
her
little
phaeton
and
pony
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
she
be
present
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
her
name
among
the
lady
at
court
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Her
indifferent
state
of
health
unhappily
prevent
her
be
in
town
;
and
by
that
mean
,
as
I
tell
Lady
Catherine
myself
one
day
,
have
deprive
the
british
court
of
its
bright
ornament
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
seem
pleased
with
the
idea
,
and
you
may
imagine
that
I
be
happy
on
every
occasion
to
offer
those
little
delicate
compliment
which
be
always
acceptable
to
lady
.
<EOS>
I
have
more
than
once
observe
to
Lady
Catherine
,
that
her
charming
daughter
seem
bear
to
be
a
duchess
,
and
that
the
most
elevated
rank
,
instead
of
give
her
consequence
,
would
be
adorn
by
her
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
the
kind
of
little
thing
which
please
her
ladyship
,
and
it
be
a
sort
of
attention
which
I
conceive
myself
peculiarly
bind
to
pay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
judge
very
properly
,
"
say
Mr.
Bennet
,
"
and
it
be
happy
for
you
that
you
possess
the
talent
of
flatter
with
delicacy
.
<EOS>
May
I
ask
whether
these
pleasing
attention
proceed
from
the
impulse
of
the
moment
,
or
be
the
result
of
previous
study
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
arise
chiefly
from
what
be
pass
at
the
time
,
and
though
I
sometimes
amuse
myself
with
suggest
and
arrange
such
little
elegant
compliment
as
may
be
adapt
to
ordinary
occasion
,
I
always
wish
to
give
them
as
unstudie
an
air
as
possible
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bennet
's
expectation
be
fully
answer
.
<EOS>
His
cousin
be
as
absurd
as
he
have
hope
,
and
he
listen
to
him
with
the
keen
enjoyment
,
maintain
at
the
same
time
the
most
resolute
composure
of
countenance
,
and
except
in
an
occasional
glance
at
Elizabeth
,
require
no
partner
in
his
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
by
tea
-
time
however
the
dose
have
be
enough
,
and
Mr.
Bennet
be
glad
to
take
his
guest
into
the
drawing
-
room
again
,
and
when
tea
be
over
,
glad
to
invite
him
to
read
aloud
to
the
lady
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
readily
assent
,
and
a
book
be
produce
;
but
on
behold
it
,
(
for
every
thing
announce
it
to
be
from
a
circulate
library

)
he
start
back
,
and
beg
pardon
,
protest
that
he
never
read
novel

<EOS>
Kitty
stare
at
him
,
and
Lydia
exclaim
.
 
<EOS>
other
book
be

and
after
some
deliberation
he
choose
Fordyce
's
Sermons
.
<EOS>
Lydia
gape
as
he
open
the
volume
,
and
before
he
have
,
with
very
monotonous
solemnity
,
read
three
page

she
interrupt
him
with

My

on
Saturday

<EOS>
I
shall
walk

hear
more
about

ask
when

<EOS>
Lydia
be
bid
by
her
two
eld
sister
to
hold
her
tongue
;
but
Mr.
Collins
,
much
offended
,
lay
aside
his
book
,
and
say
,
  
"
I
have
often
observe
how
little
young
lady
be
interested
by
book
of
a
serious
stamp
,
though
write
solely
for
their
benefit
.
<EOS>
It
amaze
me
,
I
confess
;
 
for
certainly
,
there
can
be
nothing
so
advantageous
to
them
as
instruction
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
no
longer
importune
my
young
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
turn
to
Mr.
Bennet
,
he
offer
himself
as
his
antagonist
at
backgammon
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bennet
accept
the
challenge
,
observe
that
he
act
very
wisely
in
leave
the
girl
to
their
own
trifling
amusement
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
and
her
daughter
apologise
most
civilly
for
Lydia
's
interruption
,
and
promise
that
it
should
not
occur
again
,
if
he
would
resume
his
book
;
but
Mr.
Collins
,
after
assure
them
that
he
bear
his
young
cousin
no
ill
will
,
and
should
never
resent
her
behaviour
as
any
affront
,
seat
himself
at
another
table
with
Mr.
Bennet
,
and
prepare
for
backgammon
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
be
not
a
sensible
man
,
and
the
deficiency
of
nature
have
be
but
little
assist
by
education
or
society
;
the
great
part
of
his
life
have
be
spend
under
the
guidance
of
an
illiterate
and
miserly
father
;
and
though
he
belong
to
one
of
the
university
,
he
have
merely
keep
the
necessary
term
,
without
form
at
it
any
useful
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
the
subjection
in
which
his
father
have
bring
him
up
,
have
give
him
originally
great
humility
of
manner
,
but
it
be
now
a
good
deal
counteract
by
the
self
-
conceit
of
a
weak
head
,
live
in
retirement
,
and
the
consequential
feeling
of
early
and
unexpected
prosperity
.
<EOS>
a
fortunate
chance
have
recommend
him
to
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh
when
the
living
of
Hunsford
be
vacant
;
and
the
respect
which
he
feel
for
her
high
rank
,
and
his
veneration
for
her
as
his
patroness
,
mingle
with
a
very
good
opinion
of
himself
,
of
his
authority
as
a
clergyman
,
and
his
right
as
a
rector
,
make
him
altogether
a
mixture
of
pride
and
obsequiousness
,
self
-
importance
and
humility
.
  
<EOS>
have
now
a
good
house
and
very
sufficient
income
,
he
intend
to
marry
;
and
in
seek
a
reconciliation
with
the
Longbourn
family
he
have
a
wife
in
view
,
as
he
mean
to
chuse
one
of
the
daughter
,
if
he
find
them
as
handsome
and
amiable
as
they
be
represent
by
common
report
.
<EOS>
this
be
his
plan
of
amend
 
of
atonement
 
for
inherit
their
father
's
estate
;
and
he
think
it
an
excellent
one
,
full
of
eligibility
and
suitableness
,
and
excessively
generous
and
disintereste
on
his
own
part
.
  
<EOS>
His
plan
do
not
vary
on
see
them
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Bennet
's
lovely
face
confirm
his
view
,
and
establish
all
his
strict
notion
of
what
be
due
to
seniority

and
for
the
first
evening

the

Mrs.
Bennet
before
breakfast
,
a
conversation
begin
with
his
parsonage

house

and
lead
naturally
to
the
avowal
of
his
hope
,
that
a
mistress
for
it
may
be
find
at
Longbourn
,
produce
from
her
,
amid
very
complaisant
smile
and
general
encouragement
,
a
caution
against
the
very
Jane
he
have
fix
on

<EOS>
"
as
to
her
_

daughter

she

her

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
have
only
to
change
from
Jane
to
Elizabeth
 
<EOS>
and
it
be

<EOS>
Elizabeth

equally
next
to
Jane
in
birth
and
beauty

succeed
her
of
course
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
treasure
up
the
hint
,
and
trust
that
she
may
soon
have
two
daughter
marry
;
and
the
man
whom
she
could
not
bear
to
speak
of
the
day
before
,
be
now
high
in
her
good
grace
.
  
<EOS>
Lydia
's
intention
of
walk
to
Meryton
be
not
forget
;
every
sister
except
Mary
agree
to
go
with
her
;
and
Mr.
Collins
be
to
attend
them
,
at
the
request
of
Mr.
Bennet
,
who
be
most
anxious
to
get
rid
of
him
,
and
have
his
library
to
himself
;
for
thither
Mr.
Collins
have
follow
him
after
breakfast
,
and
there
he
would
continue
,
nominally
engage
with
one
of
the
large
folio
in
the
collection
,
but
really
talk
to
Mr.
Bennet
,
with
little
cessation
,
of
his
house
and
garden
at
Hunsford
.
<EOS>
such
doing
discompose
Mr.
Bennet
exceedingly
.
<EOS>
in
his
library
he
have
be
always
sure
of
leisure
and
tranquillity
;
and
though
prepare
,
as
he
tell
Elizabeth
,
to
meet
with
folly
and
conceit
in
every
other
room
in
the
house
,
he
be
use
to
be
free
from
them
there
;
his
civility
,
therefore
,
be
most
prompt
in
invite
Mr.
Collins
to
join
his
daughter
in
their
walk
;
and
Mr.
Collins
,
be
in
fact
much
better
fit
for
a
walker
than
a
reader
,
be
extremely
well
pleased
to
close
his
large
book
,
and
go
.
  
<EOS>
in
pompous
nothing
on
his
side
,
and
civil
assent
on
that
of
his
cousin

till
they
enter
Meryton
.
<EOS>
the
attention
of
the
young
one
be
then
no
longer
to
be
gain
by
_
him
_
.
<EOS>
Their
eye
be
immediately
wander
up
in
the
street
in
quest
of
the
officer
,
and
nothing
less
than
a
very
smart
bonnet
indeed
,
or
a
really
new
muslin
in
a
shop
window
,
could
recal
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
attention
of
every
lady
be
soon
catch
by
a
young
man
,
whom
they
have
never

before
,
of
most
gentleman

like
appearance

with
an
officer
on
the

<EOS>
the
officer
be
the
very
Mr.
Denny
,
concern
whose
return
from
London

to
inquire
,
and
he
bow
as
they
pass
.
<EOS>
all
be
strike
with
the
stranger
's
air
,
all
wonder
who
he
could
be
,
and
Kitty
and
Lydia
,
determine
if
possible
to
find
out
,
lead
the
way
across
the
street
,
under
pretence
of
want
something
in
an
opposite
shop
,
and
fortunately
have
just
gain
the
pavement
when
the
two
gentleman
turn
back
have
reach
the
same
spot
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Denny

them
directly
,
and
entreat
permission
to
introduce
his
friend
,
Mr.
Wickham
,
who
have

him
the
day
before
from
town
,
and
he
be
happy
to
say
have
accept
a
commission
in
their
corp
.
<EOS>
this
be
exactly
as
it
should
be
;
for
the
young
man
want
only
regimental
to
make
him
completely
charming
.
<EOS>
His
appearance
be
greatly
in
his
favour
;
he
have
all
the
good
part
of
beauty
,
a
fine
countenance
,
a
good
figure
,
and
very
pleasing
address
.
<EOS>
the
introduction
be
follow
up
on
his
side
by
a
happy
readiness
of
conversation
 
a
readiness
at
the
same
time
perfectly
correct
and
unassuming
;
and
the
whole
party
be
still
stand
and
talk
together
very
agreeably
,
when
the
sound
of
horse
draw
their
notice
,
and
Darcy
and
Bingley
be
see
ride
down
the
street
.
<EOS>
on
distinguish
the
lady
of
the
group
,
the
two
gentleman

directly
towards
them
,
and
begin
the
usual
civility
.
<EOS>
Bingley
be
the
principal
spokesman
,
and
Miss
Bennet
the
principal
object
.
<EOS>
He
be
then
,
he
say
,
on
his
way
to
Longbourn
on
purpose
to
inquire
after
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
corroborate
it
with
a
bow
,
and
be
begin
to
determine
not
to
fix
his
eye
on
Elizabeth
,
when
they
be
suddenly
arrest
by
the
sight
of
the
stranger
,
and
Elizabeth
happen
to
see
the
countenance
of
both
as
they
look
at
each
other
,
be
all
astonishment
at
the
effect
of
the
meeting
.
<EOS>
both
change
colour
,
one
look
white
,
the
other
red
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wickham
,
after
a
few
moment
,
touch
his
hat
 
a
salutation
which
Mr.
Darcy
just
deign
to
return
.
<EOS>
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
imagine
;
it
be
impossible
not
to
long
to
know
.
  
<EOS>
in
another
minute
Mr.
Bingley
,
but
without
seem
to
have
notice
what
pass
,
take
leave
and
ride
on
with
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Denny
and
Mr.
Wickham
walk
with
the
young
lady
to
the
door
of
Mr.
Philips
's
house
,
and
then
make
their
bow
,
in
spite
of
Miss
Lydia
's
pressing
entreaty
that
they
would
come
in
,
and
even
in
spite
of
Mrs.
Philips
'
throw
up
the
parlour
window
,
and
loudly
second
the
invitation
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Philips
be
always
glad
to
see
her
niece
,
and
the
two

from
their
recent
absence
,
be
particularly
welcome
,
and
she
be
eagerly
express
her
surprise
at
their
sudden
return
home
,
which
,
as
their
own
carriage
have
not
fetch
them
,
she
should
have
know
nothing
about
,
if
she
have
not
happen
to
see
Mr.
Jones
's
shop
boy
in
the
street
,
who
have
tell
her
that
they

send
any
more

Miss
Bennets

when

towards
Mr.
Collins
by
Jane
's
introduction
of
him
.
<EOS>
She
receive
him
with
her
very
good
politeness
,
which
he
return
with
as
much
more
,
apologise
for
his
intrusion
,
without
any
previous
acquaintance
with
her
,
which
he
could
not
help
flatter
himself
however
may
be
justify
by
his
relationship
to
the
young
lady
who
introduce
him
to
her
notice
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Philips
be
quite
awe
by
such
an
excess
of
good
breeding
;
but
her
contemplation
of
one
stranger
be
soon
put
an
end
to
by
exclamation
and
inquiry
about
the
other
,
of
whom
,
however
,
she
could
only
tell
her
niece
what
they
already
know
,
that
Mr.
Denny
have
bring
him
from
London
,
and
that
he

She

,
as
he

up
and
down
the
street
,
and
have
Mr.
Wickham
appear
Kitty
and
Lydia
would
certainly
have
continue
the
occupation
,
but
unluckily
no

who
in

be
become
"
stupid
,
disagreeable
fellow

<EOS>
"
some
of
them
be
to
dine
with
the
Philipses
the
next
day
,
and
their
aunt
promise
to
make
her
husband
call
on
Mr.
Wickham
,
and
give
him
an
invitation
also
,
if
the
family
from
Longbourn
would
come
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
this
be
agree
to
,
and
Mrs.
Philips
protest
that
they
would
have
a
nice
comfortable
noisy
game
of
lottery
ticket
,
and
a
little
bit
of
hot
supper
afterwards
.
<EOS>
the
prospect
of
such
delight
be
very
cheering
,
and
they
part
in
mutual
good
spirit
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
repeat
his
apology
in
quit
the
room
,
and
be
assure
with
unwearying
civility
that
they

perfectly
needless

<EOS>
as
they
walk
home
,
Elizabeth
relate
to
Jane
what
she
have
see
pass
between
the
two
gentleman
;
but
though
Jane
would
have
defend
either
or
both
,
have
they
appear
to
be
wrong
,
she
could
no
more
explain
such
behaviour
than
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
on
his
return
highly
gratified
Mrs.
Bennet
by
admire
Mrs.
Philips
's
manner
and
politeness
.
<EOS>
He
protest
that
except
Lady
Catherine
and
her
daughter
,
he
have
never
see
a
more
elegant
woman
;
for
she
have
not
only
receive
him
with
the
utmost
civility
,
but
have
even
pointedly
include
him
in
her
invitation
for
the
next
evening
,
although
utterly
unknown
to
her
before
.
<EOS>
something
he
suppose
may
be
attribute
to
his
connection
with
them
,
but
yet
he
have
never
meet
with
so
much
attention
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
.
    
<EOS>
as
no
objection
be
make
to
the
young
people
's
engagement
with
their
aunt
,
and
all
Mr.
Collins
's
scruple
of
leave
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Bennet
for
a
single
evening
during
his
visit
be
most
steadily
resist
,
the
coach
convey
him
and
his
five
cousin
at
a
suitable
hour
to
Meryton
;
and
the
girl
have
the
pleasure
of
hearing
,
as
they
enter
the
drawing
-
room
,
that
Mr.
Wickham
have
accept
their
uncle
's
invitation
,
and
be
then
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
information
be
give
,
and
they
have
all
take
their
seat
,
Mr.
Collins
be
at
leisure
to
look
around
him
and
admire
,
and
he
be
so
much
strike
with
the
size
and
furniture
of
the
apartment
,
that
he
declare
he
may
almost
have
suppose
himself
in
the
small
summer
breakfast
parlour
at
Rosings
;
a
comparison
that
do
not
at
first
convey
much
gratification
;
but
when
Mrs.
Philips
understand
from
him
what
Rosings
be
,
and
who
be
its
proprietor
,
when
she
have
listen
to
the
description
of
only
one
of
Lady
Catherine
's
drawing

room
,
and
find
that
the
chimney

piece
alone
have
cost
eight
hundred
pound

she
feel
all
the
force
of
the
compliment
,
and
would
hardly
have
resent
a
comparison
with
the
housekeeper
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
in
describe
to
her
all
the
grandeur
of
Lady
Catherine
and
her
mansion
,
with
occasional
digression
in
praise
of
his
own
humble
abode
,
and
the
improvement
it
be
receive
,
he
be
happily
employ
until
the
gentleman
join
them
;
and
he
find
in
Mrs.
Philips
a
very
attentive
listener
,
whose
opinion
of
his
consequence
increase
with
what
she
hear
,
and
who
be
resolve
to
retail
it
all
among
her
neighbour
as
soon
as
she
could
.
<EOS>
to
the
girl
,
who
could
not
listen
to
their
cousin
,
and
who
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
wish
for
an
instrument
,
and
examine
their
own
indifferent
imitation
of
china
on
the
mantle
-
piece
,
the
interval
of
waiting
appear
very
long
.
<EOS>
It
be
over
at
last
however
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
do
approach
;
and
when
Mr.
Wickham
walk
into
the
room
,
Elizabeth
feel
that
she
have
neither
be
see
him
before
,
nor
think
of
him
since
,
with
the
small
degree
of
unreasonable
admiration
.
<EOS>
the
officer
of
the
shire
be
in
general
a
very
creditable
,
gentleman
-
like
set
,
and
the
good
of
them
be
of
the
present
party
;
but
Mr.
Wickham
be
as
far
beyond
them
all
in
person
,
countenance
,
air
,
and
walk
,
as
_
they
_
be
superior
to
the
broad
-
faced
stuffy
uncle
Philips
,
breathe
port
wine
,
who
follow
them
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wickham
be
the
happy
man
towards
whom
almost
every
female
eye
be
turn
,
and
Elizabeth
be
the
happy
woman
by
whom
he
finally
seat
himself
;
and
the
agreeable
manner
in
which
he
immediately
fall
into
conversation
,
though
it
be
only
on
its
be
a
wet
night
,
and
on
the
probability
of
a
rainy
season
,
make
her
feel
that
the
common
,
dull
,
most
thread
-
bare
topic
may
be
render
interesting
by
the
skill
of
the
speaker
.
  
<EOS>
with
such
rival
for
the
notice
of
the
fair
,
as
Mr.
Wickham
and
the
officer
,
Mr.
Collins
seem
likely
to
sink
into
insignificance
;
to
the
young
lady
he
certainly
be
nothing
;
but
he
have
still
at
interval
a
kind
listener
in
Mrs.
Philips
,
and
be
,
by
her
watchfulness
,
most
abundantly
supply
with
coffee
and
muffin
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
card
table
be
place
,
he
have
an
opportunity
of
oblige
her
in
return
,
by
sit
down
to
whist
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
little
of
the
game
,
at
present
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
shall
be
glad
to
improve
myself
,
<EOS>
for
in
my
situation
of
life
 
"
Mrs.
Philips
be
very
thankful
for
his
compliance
,
but
could
not
wait
for
his
reason
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wickham
do
not
play
at
whist
,
and
with
ready
delight
be
he
receive
at
the
other
table
between
Elizabeth
and
Lydia
.
<EOS>
at
first
there
seem
danger
of
Lydia
's
engross
him
entirely
,
for
she
be
a
most
determined
talker
;
but
be
likewise
extremely
fond
of
lottery
ticket
,
she
soon
grow
too
much
interested
in
the
game
,
too
eager
in
make
bet
and
exclaim
after
prize
,
to
have
attention
for
any
one
in
particular
.
<EOS>
allow
for
the
common
demand
of
the
game
,
Mr.
Wickham
be
therefore
at
leisure
to
talk
to
Elizabeth
,
and
she
be
very
willing
to
hear
him
,
though
what
she
chiefly
wish
to
hear
she
could
not
hope
to
be
tell
,
the
history
of
his
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Darcy
.
<EOS>
She
dare
not
even
mention
that
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Her
curiosity
however
be
unexpectedly
relieve
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wickham
begin
the
subject
himself
.
<EOS>
He
inquire
how
far
Netherfield
be
from
Meryton
;
and
,
after
receive
her
answer
,
ask
in
an
hesitating
manner
how
long
Mr.
Darcy
have
be
stay
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
about
a
month
,
"
say
Elizabeth
;
and
then
,
unwilling
to
let
the
subject
drop
,
add
,
"
He
be
a
man
of
very
large
property
in
Derbyshire
,
I
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
reply
Wickham
;
 
"
his
estate
<EOS>
there
be
a
noble
one
.
<EOS>
a
clear
ten
thousand
per
annum
.
<EOS>
You
could
not
have
meet
with
a
person
more
capable
of
give
you
certain
information
on
that
head
than
myself
 
for
I
have
be
connect
with
his
family
in
a
particular
manner
from
my
infancy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
could
not
but
look
surprised
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
well
be
surprised
,
Miss
Bennet
,
at
such
an
assertion
,
after
see
,
as
you
probably
may
,
the
very
cold
manner
of
our
meeting
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
be
you
much
acquaint
with
Mr.
Darcy
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
much
as
I
ever
wish
to
be
,
"
cry
Elizabeth
warmly
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
spend
four
day
in
the
same
house
with
him
,
and
I
think
him
very
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
right
to
give
_
my
_
opinion
,
"
say
Wickham
,
"
as
to
his
be
agreeable
or
otherwise
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
qualified
to
form
one
.
<EOS>
I
have
know
him
too
long
and
too
well
to
be
a
fair
judge
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
_
me
_
to
be
impartial
.
<EOS>
but
I
believe
your
opinion
of
him
would
in
general
astonish
 
<EOS>
and
perhaps
you
would
not
express
it
quite
so
strongly
anywhere
else
.
 
<EOS>
here
you
be
in
your
own
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
I
say
no
more
_
here
<EOS>
_
than
I
may
say
in
any
house
in
the
neighbourhood
,
except
Netherfield
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
at
all
like
in
Hertfordshire
.
<EOS>
every
body
be
disgusted
with
his
pride
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
find
him
more
favourably
speak
of
by
any
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
pretend
to
be
sorry
,
"
say
Wickham
,
after
a
short
interruption
,
"
that
he
or
that
any
man
should
not
be
estimate
beyond
their
desert
;
but
with
_
him
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
believe
it
do
not
often
happen
.
<EOS>
the
world
be
blind
by
his
fortune
and
consequence
,
or
frighten
by
his
high
and
impose
manner
,
and
see
him
only
as
he
chuse
to
be
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
take
him
,
even
on
_
my
_
slight
acquaintance
,
to
be
an
ill
-
tempered
man
.
<EOS>
"
Wickham
only
shake
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
,
"
say
he
,
at
the
next
opportunity
of
speak
,
"
whether
he
be
likely
to
be
in
this
country
much
longer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
at
all
know
;
but
I
_
hear
_
nothing
of
his
go
away
when
I
be
at
Netherfield
.
<EOS>
I
hope
your
plan
in
favour
of
the
shire
will
not
be
affect
by
his
being
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
oh
!
no
 
<EOS>
it
be
not
for
_
me
_
to
be
drive
away
by
Mr.
Darcy

<EOS>
if
_
<EOS>
he
<EOS>
_
wish
to
avoid

_
me

he
must
go

<EOS>
We
be
not
on
friendly
term

it
always
give
me
pain
to
meet
him
,

I
have
no
reason
for
avoid
_
him

_
<EOS>

what
I
may
proclaim
to
all
the
world
;
a
sense
of
very
great
ill
usage
,
and
most
painful
regret
at
his
be
what
he
be
.
<EOS>
His
father
,
Miss
Bennet
,
the
late
Mr.
Darcy
,
be
one
of
the
good
man
that
ever
breathe
,
and
the
true
friend
I
ever
have
;

I
can
never
be
in
company
with
this
Mr.
Darcy
without
be
grieve
to
the
soul
by
a
thousand
tender
recollection
.
<EOS>
His
behaviour
to
myself
have
be
scandalous
;
but
I
verily
believe
I
could
forgive
him
any
thing
and
every
thing
,
rather
than
his
disappoint
the
hope
and
disgrace
the
memory
of
his
father

"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
find
the
interest
of
the
subject
increase
,
and
listen
with
all
her
heart

the
delicacy
of
it
prevent
farth
inquiry

<EOS>
Mr.
Wickham
begin
to
speak
on
more
general
topic
,
Meryton
,
the
neighbourhood
,
the
society
,
appear
highly
pleased
with
all
that
he
have
yet
see
,
and
speak
of
the
latter
especially
,
with
gentle

very
intelligible
gallantry

It
be
the
prospect

constant
society

good
society

he
add
,

which
be
my
chief
inducement

my

Denny
tempt
me
farther
by

I

my
spirit
will
not
bear
solitude

<EOS>
I
_
must

have
employment

society

<EOS>
a
military
life

not
what
I

there
be
just
such
an
informality
in
the
term

the
bequest

to
give
me
no
hope
from
law

<EOS>
a
man
of
honour
could
not
have
doubt
the
intention
,
but
Mr.
Darcy
choose
to
doubt
it
 
or
to
treat
it
as
a
merely
conditional
recommendation
,

to
assert
that
I
have
forfeit
all
claim
to
it
by
extravagance
,
imprudence

in
short
any
thing
or
nothing

<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
that
the
living
become
vacant
two
year
ago

exactly
as
I
be
of
an
age
to
hold
it
,
and
that
it
be
give
to
another
man

no
less
certain
be
it

that
I
can
not
accuse
myself
of
have
really
do
any

to
deserve
to
lose
it

I
have
a
warm

unguarded
temper

I
may
perhaps
have
sometimes
speak
my
opinion

of
_
him

<EOS>
to

him

too
freely

<EOS>
I
can
recal
nothing
bad

the
fact

when

express
her
concern
thereupon

he
assure
her
with
much
earnest
gravity
that
it
be
not

importance

that
he
consider
the
money
as

undoubtedly
many
who
could
not

thank
to

remove
far
beyond
the

little

Mr.

catch
;

after
observe
Mr.

for
a
few
moment

he
ask
Elizabeth
in

low
voice
whether
her
relation

know

this
information
make
Elizabeth
smile

as
she
think
of
poor
Miss
Bingley

<EOS>
Vain
indeed
must
be
all
her
attention

vain
and
useless
her
affection
for
his
sister

her
praise
of
himself

destine

another

from
some
particular
that

suspect

mislead
him

that
in

conceited

her
to

I

her

many

I
very
well
remember
that

that
her
manner
be
dictatorial
and
insolent

She
have
the
reputation
of
be
remarkably
sensible

clever

I
rather
believe
she
derive
part
of
her
ability
from
her
rank

fortune

part
from
her
authoritative
manner

and
the
rest
from
the
pride

chuse

<EOS>
Elizabeth
allow
that
he
have
give
a
very
rational
account
of
it
,
and
they
continue
talk
together
with
mutual
satisfaction

supper
put
an
end
to
card

give
the
rest

there
could
be
no
conversation

noise

his
manner
recommend
him
to
every
body

he

be

well

whatever
he
do

do
gracefully

go
away

head
full

of

have
tell

all
the
way
home

there
be
not
time

her
even
to
mention

Mr.

,
in
describe
the
civility

protest
that
he
do
not

have

listen
with
astonishment

concern

she
know
not
how
to
believe
that
Mr.

could
be
so
unworthy
of
Mr.

regard

yet
,
it
be
not
in
her
nature
to
question
the
veracity

man
of
such
amiable
appearance

Wickham

<EOS>
the
possibility
of
his
have
really
endure
such
unkindness
,
be
enough
to
interest
all
her
tender
feeling

and
nothing
therefore
remain
to
be
do
,

to
think
well
of
them
both

to
defend
the
conduct

into

do

consider
in
what
a

light
it
place

no

could
think
with

on

one
point

that

to
give
their
personal
invitation
for
the
long
expect
ball
at
Netherfield
,
which
be
fix
for
the
follow
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
the
two
lady
be
delighted
to
see
their
dear
friend
again
,
call
it
an
age
since
they
have
meet
,
and
repeatedly
ask
what
she
have
be
do
with
herself
since
their
separation
.
<EOS>
to
the
rest
of
the
family
they
pay
little
attention
;
avoid
Mrs.
Bennet
as
much
as
possible
,
say
not
much
to
Elizabeth
,
and
nothing
at
all
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
They
be
soon
go
again
,
rise
from
their
seat
with
an
activity
which
take
their
brother
by
surprise
,
and
hurry
off
as
if
eager
to
escape
from
Mrs.
Bennet
's
civility
.
  
<EOS>
the
prospect
of
the
Netherfield
ball
be
extremely
agreeable
to
every
female
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
choose
to
consider
it
as
give
in
compliment
to
her
eld
daughter
,
and
be
particularly
flatter
by
receive
the
invitation
from
Mr.
Bingley
himself
,
instead
of
a
ceremonious
card
.
<EOS>
Jane
picture
to
herself
a
happy
evening
in
the
society
of
her
two
friend
,
and
the
attention
of
their
brother
;
and
Elizabeth
think
with
pleasure
of
dance
a
great
deal
with
Mr.
Wickham
,
and
of
see
a
confirmation
of
every
thing
in
Mr.
Darcy
's
look
and
behaviour
.
<EOS>
the
happiness
anticipate
by
Catherine
and
Lydia
,
depend
less
on
any
single
event
,
or
any
particular
person
,
for
though
they
each
,
like
Elizabeth
,
mean
to
dance
half
the
evening
with
Mr.
Wickham
,
he
be
by
no
means
<EOS>
the
only
partner
who
could
satisfy
them
,
and
a
ball
be
at
any
rate
,
a
ball
.
<EOS>
and
even
Mary
could
assure
her
family
that
she
have
no
disinclination
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
while
I
can
have
my
morning
to
myself
,
"
say
she
,
"
it
be
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
no
sacrifice
to
join
occasionally
in
evening
engagement
.
<EOS>
society
have
claim
on
us
all
;
and
I
profess
myself
one
of
those
who
consider
interval
of
recreation
and
amusement
as
desirable
for
every
body
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
's
spirit
be
so
high
on
the
occasion
,
that
though
she
do
not
often
speak
unnecessarily
to
Mr.
Collins
,
she
could
not
help
ask
him
whether
he
intend
to
accept
Mr.
Bingley
's
invitation
,
and
if
he
do
,
whether
he
would
think
it
proper
to
join
in
the
evening
's
amusement
;
and
she
be
rather
surprised
to
find
that
he
entertain
no
scruple
whatever
on
that
head
,
and
be
very
far
from
dread
a
rebuke
either
from
the
Archbishop
,
or
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh
,
by
venture
to
dance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
by
no
means
of
opinion
,
I
assure
you
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
a
ball
of
this
kind
,
give
by
a
young
man
of
character
,
to
respectable
people
,
can
have
any
evil
tendency
;
and
I
be
so
far
from
object
to
dance
myself
that
I
shall
hope
to
be
honour
with
the
hand
of
all
my
fair
cousin
in
the
course
of
the
evening
,
and
I
take
this
opportunity
of
solicit
yours
,
Miss
Elizabeth
,
for
the
two
first
dance
especially
,
 
a
preference
which
I
trust
my
cousin
Jane
will
attribute
to
the
right
cause
,
and
not
to
any
disrespect
for
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
feel
herself
completely
take
in
.
<EOS>
She
have
fully
propose
be
engage
by
Wickham
for
those
very
dance
:
 
and
to
have
Mr.
Collins
instead
!
<EOS>
her
liveliness
have
be
never
worse
time
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
help
for
it
however
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wickham
's
happiness
and
her
own
be
per
force
<EOS>
delay
a
little
longer
,
and
Mr.
Collins
's
proposal
accept
with
as
good
a
grace
as
she
could
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
the
better
pleased
with
his
gallantry
,
from
the
idea
it
suggest
of
something
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
now
first
strike
her
,
that
_
she
_
be
select
from
among
her
sister
as
worthy
of
be
the
mistress
of
Hunsford
Parsonage
,
and
of
assist
to
form
a
quadrille
table
at
Rosings
,
in
the
absence
of
more
eligible
visitor
.
<EOS>
the
idea
soon
reach
to
conviction
,
as
she
observe
his
increase
civility
toward
herself
,
and
hear
his
frequent
attempt
at
a
compliment
on
her
wit
and
vivacity
;
and
though
more
astonished
than
gratified
herself
,
by
this
effect
of
her
charm
,
it
be
not
long
before
her
mother
give
her
to
understand
that
the
probability
of
their
marriage
be
exceedingly
agreeable
to
_
her
_
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
however
do
not
chuse
to
take
the
hint
,
be
well
aware
that
a
serious
dispute
must
be
the
consequence
of
any
reply
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
may
never
make
the
offer
,
and
till
he
do
,
it
be
useless
to
quarrel
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
if
there
have
not
be
a
Netherfield
ball
to
prepare
for
and
talk
of
,
the
young
Miss
Bennets
would
have
be
in
a
pitiable
state
at
this
time
,
for
from
the
day
of
the
invitation
,
to
the
day
of
the
ball
,
there
be
such
a
succession
of
rain
as
prevent
their
walking
to
Meryton
once
.
<EOS>
no
aunt
,
no
officer
,
no
news
could
be
seek
after
;
 
the
very
shoe
-
rose
for
Netherfield
be
get
by
proxy
.
<EOS>
even
Elizabeth
may
have
find
some
trial
of
her
patience
in
weather
,
which
totally
suspend
the
improvement
of
her
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Wickham
;
and
nothing
less
than
a
dance
on
Tuesday
,
could
have
make
such
a
Friday
,
Saturday
,
Sunday
and
Monday
,
endurable
to
Kitty
and
Lydia
.
    
<EOS>
till
Elizabeth
enter
the
drawing
-
room
at
Netherfield
and
look
in
vain
for
Mr.
Wickham
among
the
cluster
of
red
coat
there
assemble
,
a
doubt
of
his
be
present
have
never
occur
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
certainty
of
meet
him
have
not
be
check
by
any
of
those
recollection
that
may
not
unreasonably
have
alarm
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
dress
with
more
than
usual
care
,
and
prepare
in
the
high
spirit
for
the
conquest
of
all
that
remain
unsubdued
of
his
heart
,
trust
that
it
be
not
more
than
may
be
win
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
but
in
an
instant
arise
the
dreadful
suspicion
of
his
be
purposely
omit
for
Mr.
Darcy
's
pleasure
in
the
Bingleys
'
invitation
to
the
officer
;
and
though
this
be
not
exactly
the
case
,
the
absolute
fact
of
his
absence
be
pronounce
by
his
friend
Mr.
Denny
,
to
whom
Lydia
eagerly
apply
,
and
who
tell
them
that
Wickham
have
be
oblige
to
go
to
town
on
business
the
day
before
,
and
be
not
yet
return
;
add
,
with
a
significant
smile
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
imagine
his
business
would
have
call
him
away
just
now
,
if
he
have
not
wish
to
avoid
a
certain
gentleman
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
part
of
his
intelligence
,
though
unheard
by
Lydia
,
be
catch
by
Elizabeth
,
and
as
it
assure
her
that
Darcy
be
not
less
answerable
for
Wickham
's
absence
than
if
her
first
surmise
have
be
just
,
every
feeling
of
displeasure
against
the
former
be
so
sharpen
by
immediate
disappointment
,
that
she
could
hardly
reply
with
tolerable
civility
to
the
polite
inquiry
which
he
directly
afterwards
approach
to
make
.
 
<EOS>
attention
,
forbearance
,
patience
with
Darcy
,
be
injury
to
Wickham
.
<EOS>
She
be
resolve
against
any
sort
of
conversation
with
him
,
and
turn
away
with
a
degree
of
ill
humour
,
which
she
could
not
wholly
surmount
even
in
speak
to
Mr.
Bingley
,
whose
blind
partiality
provoke
her
.
  
<EOS>
but
Elizabeth
be
not
form
for
ill
-
humour
;
and
though
every
prospect
of
her
own
be
destroy
for
the
evening
,
it
could
not
dwell
long
on
her
spirit
;
and
have
tell
all
her
griefs
to
Charlotte
Lucas
,
whom
she
have
not
see
for
a
week
,
she
be
soon
able
to
make
a
voluntary
transition
to
the
oddity
of
her
cousin
,
and
to
point
him
out
to
her
particular
notice
.
<EOS>
the
two
first
dance
,
however
,
bring
a
return
of
distress
;
they
be
dance
of
mortification
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
,
awkward
and
solemn
,
apologise
instead
of
attend
,
and
often
move
wrong
without
be
aware
of
it
,
give
her
all
the
shame
and
misery
which
a
disagreeable
partner
for
a
couple
of
dance
can
give
.
<EOS>
the
moment
of
her
release
from
him
be
ecstacy
.
  
<EOS>
She
dance
next
with
an
officer
,
and
have
the
refreshment
of
talk
of
Wickham
,
and
of
hear
that
he
be
universally
like
.
<EOS>
when
those
dance
be
over
she
return
to
Charlotte
Lucas
,
and
be
in
conversation
with
her
,
when
she
find
herself
suddenly
address
by
Mr.
Darcy
,
who
take
her
so
much
by
surprise
in
his
application
for
her
hand
,
that
,
without
know
what
she
do
,
she
accept
him
.
<EOS>
He
walk
away
again
immediately
,
and
she
be
leave
to
fret
over
her
own
want
of
presence
of
mind
;
Charlotte
try
to
console
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
you
will
find
him
very
agreeable
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Heaven
forbid
!
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
that
_
would
be
the
great
misfortune
of
all

<EOS>
to
find
a
man
agreeable
whom
one
be
determine
to
hate
!
 
<EOS>
do
not
wish
me
such
an
evil
.

"
  
<EOS>
when
the
dancing
recommence
,
however
,
and
Darcy
approach
to
claim
her
hand
,
Charlotte
could
not
help
caution
her
in
a
whisper
not
to
be
a
simpleton
and
allow
her
fancy
for
Wickham
to
make
her
appear
unpleasant
in
the
eye
of
a
man
of
ten
time
his
consequence
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
make
no
answer
,
and
take
her
place
in
the
set
,
amazed
at
the
dignity
to
which
she
be
arrive
in
be
allow
to
stand
opposite
to
Mr.
Darcy
,
and
read
in
her
neighbour
'
<EOS>
look
their
equal
amazement
in
behold
it
.
<EOS>
They
stand
for
some
time
without
speak
a
word
;
and
she
begin
to
imagine
that
their
silence
be
to
last
through
the
two
dance
,
and
at
first
be
resolve
not
to
break
it
;
till
suddenly
fancy
that
it
would
be
the
great
punishment
to
her
partner
to
oblige
him
to
talk
,
she
make
some
slight
observation
on
the
dance
.
<EOS>
He
reply
,
and
be
again
silent
.
<EOS>
after
a
pause
of
some
minute
she
address
him
a
second
time
with
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
_
your
_
turn
to
say
something
now
,
Mr.
Darcy
.
 
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
talk
about
the
dance
,
and
_
you
_
ought
to
make
some
kind
of
remark
on
the
size
of
the
room
,
or
the
number
of
couple
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
smile
,
and
assure
her
that
whatever
she
wish
him
to
say
should
be
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
that
reply
will
do
for
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
by
<EOS>
and
bye
<EOS>
I
may
observe
that
private
ball
be
much
pleasanter
than
public
one
.
 
<EOS>
but
_
now
_
we
may
be
silent
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
talk
by
rule
then
,
while
you
be
dance
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
sometimes
.
<EOS>
one
must
speak
a
little
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
It
would
look
odd
to
be
entirely
silent
for
half
an
hour
together
,
and
yet
for
the
advantage
of
_
some
_
,
conversation
ought
to
be
so
arrange
as
that
they
may
have
the
trouble
of
say
as
little
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
consult
your
own
feeling
in
the
present
case

you

mine

"
  
<EOS>
"
both
,
"
reply
Elizabeth
archly
;
"
for
I
have
always
see
a
great
similarity
in
the
turn
of
our
mind
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
each
of
an
unsocial
,
taciturn
disposition
,
unwilling
to
speak
,
unless
we
expect
to
say
something
that
will
amaze
the
whole
room
,
and
be
hand
down
to
posterity
with
all
the
eclat
of
a
proverb
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
no
very
striking
resemblance
of
your
own
character
,
I
be
sure
,

say
he
.
<EOS>
"
how
near
it
may
be
to
_
mine
_
,
I
can
not
pretend
to
say

<EOS>
You

it
a
faithful
portrait
undoubtedly

must
not

performance

<EOS>
He
make
no
answer
,
and
they
be
again
silent
till
they
have
go
down
the
dance
,
when
he
ask
her
if
she
and
her
sister
do
not
very
often
walk
to
Meryton
.
<EOS>
She
answer
in
the
affirmative
,
and
,
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
,
add
,
"
when
you
meet
us
there
the
other
day
,
we
have
just
be
form
a
new
acquaintance

<EOS>
the
effect
be
immediate
.
<EOS>
a
deep
shade
of
hauteur
overspread
his
feature
,
but
he
say
not
a
word
,
and
Elizabeth
,
though
blame
herself
for
her
own
weakness
,
could
not
go
on
.
<EOS>
at
length
Darcy
speak
,
and
in
a
constrained
manner
say
,
  
"
<EOS>
Mr.

be
bless
with

happy
manner

<EOS>
"
He
have
be
so
unlucky
as
to
lose
_
your

friendship

"
reply
Elizabeth
with
emphasis
,
"
and
in
a
manner
which
he
be
likely
to
suffer
from
all
his
life
.
"
  
<EOS>
Darcy
make
no
answer
,
and
seem
desirous
of
change
the
subject
.
<EOS>
at
that
moment
Sir
William
Lucas
appear
close
to
them
,
mean
to
pass
through
the
set
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
;
but
on
perceive
Mr.
Darcy
he
stopt
with
a
bow
of
superior
courtesy
to
compliment
him
on
his
dancing
and
his
partner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
most
highly
gratified
indeed
,
my
dear
Sir

<EOS>
such
very
superior
dancing
be
not
often
see
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
that
you
belong
to
the
first
circle

<EOS>
allow
me
to
say
,
however
,
that
your
fair
partner
do
not
disgrace
you
,
and
that
I
must
hope
to
have
this
pleasure
often
repeat
,

when
a
certain
desirable
event
,
my

Miss
Eliza
,
(
glance
at
her
sister

Bingley

shall
take
place
.
<EOS>
what
congratulation
will
then
flow
in
!
<EOS>
I
appeal
to
Mr.
Darcy
:
 
but
let
me
not
interrupt
you
,
Sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
not
thank
me
for
detain
you
from
the
bewitching
converse
of
that
young
lady
,
whose
bright
eye
be
also
upbraid
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
latter
part
of
this
address
be
scarcely
hear
by
Darcy
;
but
Sir
William
's
allusion
to
his
friend
seem
to
strike
him
forcibly
,
and
his
eye
be
direct
with
a
very
serious
expression
towards
Bingley
and
Jane
,
who
be
dance
together
.
<EOS>
recover
himself
,
however
,
shortly
,
he
turn
to
his
partner
,
and
say
,
  
"
Sir
William
's
interruption
have
make
me
forget
what
we
be
talk
of
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
we
be
speak
at
all
.
<EOS>
Sir
William
could
not
have
interrupt
any
two
people
in
the
room
who
have
less
to
say
for
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
try
two
or
three
subject
already
without
success
,
and
what
we
be
to
talk
of
next
I
can
not
imagine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
think
you
of
book
?
"
say
he
,
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
book
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
no
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
we
never
read
the
same
,
or
not
with
the
same
feeling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
you
think
so
;
but
if
that
be
the
case
,
there
can
at
least
be
no
want
of
subject
.
 
<EOS>
We
may
compare
our
different
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
 
I
can
not
talk
of
book
in
a
ball
-
room
;
my
head
be
always
full
of
something
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
_
present
_
always
occupy
you
in
such
scene
 
do
it
?
"
say
he
,
with
a
look
of
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
always
,
"
she
reply
,
without
know
what
she
say
,
for
her
thought
have
wander
far
from
the
subject
,
as
soon
afterwards
appear
by
her
suddenly
exclaim
,
"
I
remember
hear
you
once
say
,
Mr.
Darcy
,
that
you
hardly
ever
forgave
,
that
your
resentment
once
create
be
unappeasable
.
<EOS>
You
be
very
cautious
,
I
suppose
,
as
to
its
_
be
create
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
,
"
say
he
,
with
a
firm
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
never
allow
yourself
to
be
blind
by
prejudice
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
particularly
incumbent
on
those
who
never
change
their
opinion
,
to
be
secure
of
judge
properly
at
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
to
what
these
question
tend
?
"
  
"
merely
to
the
illustration
of
_
your
_
character
,
"
say
she
,
endeavour
to
shake
off
her
gravity
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
try
to
make
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
be
your
success
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
shake
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
get
on
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
hear
such
different
account
of
you
as
puzzle
me
exceedingly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
readily
believe
,
"
answer
he
gravely
,
"
that
report
may
vary
greatly
with
respect
to
me
;
and
I
could
wish
,
Miss
Bennet
,
that
you
be
not
to
sketch
my
character
at
the
present
moment
,
as
there
be
reason
to
fear
that
the
performance
would
reflect
no
credit
on
either
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
I
do
not
take
your
likeness
now
,
I
may
never
have
another
opportunity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
by
no
means
suspend
any
pleasure
of
yours
,
"
he
coldly
reply
.
<EOS>
She
say
no
more
,
and
they
go
down
the
other
dance
and
part
in
silence
;
on
each
side
dissatisfy
,
though
not
to
an
equal
degree
,
for
in
Darcy
's
breast
<EOS>
there
be
a
tolerable
powerful
feeling
towards
her
,
which
soon
procure
her
pardon
,
and
direct
all
his
anger
against
another
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
not
long
separate
when
Miss
Bingley
come
towards
her
,
and
with
an
expression
of
civil
disdain
thus
accost
her
,
  
"
<EOS>
so
,
Miss
Eliza
,
I
hear
you
be
quite
delighted
with
George
Wickham
!
 
<EOS>
Your
sister
have
be
talk
to
me
about
him
,
and
ask
me
a
thousand
question
;
and
I
find
that
the
young
man
forget
to
tell
you
,
among
his
other
communication
,
that
he
be
the
son
of
old
Wickham
,
the
late
Mr.
Darcy
's
steward
.
<EOS>
let
me
recommend
you
,
however
,
as
a
friend
,
not
to
give
implicit
confidence
to
all
his
assertion
;
for
as
to
Mr.
Darcy
be
use
him
ill
,
it
be
perfectly
false
;
for
,
on
the
contrary
,
he
have
be
always
remarkably
kind
to
him
,
though
George
Wickham
have
treat
Mr.
Darcy
in
a
most
infamous
manner
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
the
particular
,
but
I
know
very
well
that
Mr.
Darcy
be
not
in
the
least
to
blame
,
that
he
can
not
bear
to
hear
George
Wickham
mention
,
and
that
though
my
brother
think
he
could
not
well
avoid
include
him
in
his
invitation
to
the
officer
,
he
be
excessively
glad
to
find
that
he
have
take
himself
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
His
come
into
the
country
at
all
,
be
a
most
insolent
thing
indeed
,
and
I
wonder
how
he
could
presume
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
pity
you
,
Miss
Eliza
,
for
this
discovery
of
your
favourite
's
guilt
;
but
really
consider
his
descent
,
one
could
not
expect
much
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
guilt
and
his
descent
appear
by
your
account
to
be
the
same
,
"
say
Elizabeth
angrily
;
"
for
I
have
hear
you
accuse
him
of
nothing
bad
than
of
be
the
son
of
Mr.
Darcy
's
steward
,
and
of
_
<EOS>
that
_
,
I
can
assure
you
,
he
inform
me
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
reply
Miss
Bingley
,
turn
away
with
a
sneer
.
"
<EOS>
excuse
my
interference
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
kindly
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
insolent
girl
!
"
say
Elizabeth
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
much
mistake
if
you
expect
to
influence
me
by
such
a
paltry
attack
as
this
.
<EOS>
I
see
nothing
in
it
but
your
own
wilful
ignorance
and
the
malice
of
Mr.
Darcy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
then
seek
her
eld
sister
,
who
have
undertake
to
make
inquiry
on
the
same
subject
of
Bingley
.
<EOS>
Jane
meet
her
with
a
smile
of
such
sweet
complacency
,
a
glow
of
such
happy
expression
,
as
sufficiently
mark
how
well
she
be
satisfied
with
the
occurrence
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Elizabeth
instantly
read
her
feeling
,
and
at
that
moment
solicitude
for
Wickham
,
resentment
against
his
enemy
,
and
every
thing
else
give
way
before
the
hope
of
Jane
's
be
in
the
fair
way
for
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
know
,
"
say
she
,
with
a
countenance
no
less
smiling
than
her
sister
's
,
"
what
you
have
learn
about
Mr.
Wickham
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
you
have
be
too
pleasantly
engaged
to
think
of
any
third
person
;
in
which
case
you
may
be
sure
of
my
pardon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
reply
Jane
,
"
I
have
not
forget
him
;
but
I
have
nothing
satisfactory
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bingley
do
not
know
the
whole
of
his
history
,
and
be
quite
ignorant
of
the
circumstance
which
have
principally
offend
Mr.
Darcy
;
but
he
will
vouch
for
the
good
conduct
,
the
probity
and
honour
of
his
friend
,
and
be
perfectly
convince
that
Mr.
Wickham
have
deserve
much
less
attention
from
Mr.
Darcy
than
he
have
receive
;
and
I
be
sorry
to
say
that
by
his
account
as
well
as
his
sister
's
,
Mr.
Wickham
be
by
no
mean
a
respectable
young
man
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
he
have
be
very
imprudent
,
and
have
deserve
to
lose
Mr.
Darcy
's
regard
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Bingley
do
not
know
Mr.
Wickham
himself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
he
never
see
him
till
the
other
morning
at
Meryton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
account
then
be
what
he
have
receive
from
Mr.
Darcy
.
<EOS>
I
be
perfectly
satisfied
.
<EOS>
but
what
do
he
say
of
the
living
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
do
not
exactly
recollect
the
circumstance
,
though
he
have
hear
them
from
Mr.
Darcy
more
than
once
,
but
he
believe
that
it
be
leave
to
him
_
conditionally
_
only
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
a
doubt
of
Mr.
Bingley
's
sincerity
,
"
say
Elizabeth
warmly
;
"
<EOS>
but
you
must
excuse
my
not
be
convince
by
assurance
only
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bingley
's
defence
of
his
friend
be
a
very
able
one
I
dare
say
,
but
since
he
be
unacquainted
with
several
part
of
the
story
,
and
have
learn
the
rest
from
that
friend
himself
,
I
shall
venture
still
to
think
of
both
gentleman
as
I
do
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
then
change
the
discourse
to
one
more
gratify
to
each
,
and
on
which
there
could
be
no
difference
of
sentiment
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
listen
with
delight
to
the
happy
,
though
modest
hope
which
Jane
entertain
of
Bingley
's
regard
,
and
say
all
in
her
power
to
heighten
her
confidence
in
it
.
<EOS>
on
their
being
join
by
Mr.
Bingley
himself
,
Elizabeth
withdraw
to
Miss
Lucas
;
to
whose
inquiry
after
the
pleasantness
of
her
last
partner
she
have
scarcely
reply
,
before
Mr.
Collins
come
up
to
them
and
tell
her
with
great
exultation
that
he
have
just
be
so
fortunate
as
to
make
a
most
important
discovery
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
find
out
,
"
say
he
,
"
by
a
singular
accident
,
that
there
be
now
in
the
room
a
near
relation
of
my
patroness
.
<EOS>
I
happen
to
overhear
the
gentleman
himself
mention
to
the
young
lady
who
do
the
honour
of
this
house
the
name
of
his
cousin
Miss
de
Bourgh
,
and
of
her
mother
Lady
Catherine
.
<EOS>
how
wonderfully
these
sort
of
thing
occur
!
<EOS>
who
would
have
think
of
my
meeting
with
 
perhaps
 
a
nephew
of
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh
in
this
assembly
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
most
thankful
that
the
discovery
be
make
in
time
for
me
to
pay
my
respect
to
him
,
which
I
be
now
go
to
do
,
and
trust
he
will
excuse
my
not
have
do
it
before
.
<EOS>
My
total
ignorance
of
the
connection
must
plead
my
apology
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
not
go
to
introduce
yourself
to
Mr.
Darcy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
be
.
<EOS>
I
shall
intreat
his
pardon
for
not
have
do
it
earlier
.
<EOS>
I
believe
him
to
be
Lady
Catherine
's
_
nephew
_
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
in
my
power
to
assure
him
that
her
ladyship
be
quite
well
yesterday
se'night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
try
hard
to
dissuade
him
from
such
a
scheme
;
assure
him
that
Mr.
Darcy
would
consider
his
address
him
without
introduction
as
an
impertinent
freedom
,
rather
than
a
compliment
to
his
aunt
;
that
it
be
not
in
the
least
necessary
there
should
be
any
notice
on
either
side
,
and
that
if
it
be
,
it
must
belong
to
Mr.
Darcy
,
the
superior
in
consequence
,
to
begin
the
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
listen
to
her
with
the
determined
air
of
follow
his
own
inclination
,
and
when
she
cease
speak
,
reply
thus
,
  
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Miss
Elizabeth
,
I
have
the
high
opinion
in
the
world
of
your
excellent
judgment
in
all
matter
within
the
scope
of
your
understanding
,
but
permit
me
to
say
that
there
must
be
a
wide
difference
between
the
establish
form
of
ceremony
amongst
the
laity
,
and
those
which
regulate
the
clergy
;
for
give
me
leave
to
observe
that
I
consider
the
clerical
office
as
equal
in
point
of
dignity
with
the
high
rank
in
the
kingdom
 
<EOS>
provide
that
a
proper
humility
of
behaviour
be
at
the
same
time
maintain
.
<EOS>
You
must
therefore
allow
me
to
follow
the
dictate
of
my
conscience
on
this
occasion
,
which
lead
me
to
perform
what
I
look
on
as
a
point
of
duty
.
<EOS>
pardon
me
for
neglect
to
profit
by
your
advice
,
which
on
every
other
subject
shall
be
my
constant
guide
,
though
in
the
case
before
us
I
consider
myself
more
fit
by
education
and
habitual
study
to
decide
on
what
be
right
than
a
young
lady
like
yourself
.
"
<EOS>
and
with
a
low
bow
he
leave
her
to
attack
Mr.
Darcy
,
whose
reception
of
his
advance
she
eagerly
watch
,
and
whose
astonishment
at
be
so
addressed
be
very
evident
.
<EOS>
Her
cousin
preface
his
speech
with
a
solemn
bow
,
and
though
she
could
not
hear
a
word
of
it
,
she
feel
as
if
hear
it
all
,
and
see
in
the
motion
of
his
lip
<EOS>
the
word
"
apology
,
"
"
hunsford
,
"
and
"
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
vex
her
to
see
him
expose
himself
to
such
a
man
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
be
eye
him
with
unrestrained
wonder
,
and
when
at
last
Mr.
Collins
allow
him
time
to
speak
,
reply
with
an
air
of
distant
civility
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
,
however
,
be
not
discourage
from
speak
again
,
and
Mr.
Darcy
's
contempt
seem
abundantly
increase
with
the
length
of
his
second
speech
,
and
at
the
end
of
it
he
only
make
him
a
slight
bow
,
and
move
another
way
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
then
return
to
Elizabeth
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
reason
,
I
assure
you
,
"
say
he
,
"
to
be
dissatisfy
with
my
reception
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
seem
much
pleased
with
the
attention
.
<EOS>
He
answer
me
with
the
utmost
civility
,
and
even
pay
me
the
compliment
of
say
,
that
he
be
so
well
convinced
of
Lady
Catherine
's
discernment
as
to
be
certain
she
could
never
bestow
a
favour
unworthily
.
<EOS>
It
be
really
a
very
handsome
thought
.
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
I
be
much
pleased
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
Elizabeth
have
no
longer
any
interest
of
her
own
to
pursue
,
she
turn
her
attention
almost
entirely
on
her
sister
and
Mr.
Bingley
,
and
the
train
of
agreeable
reflection
which
her
observation
give
birth
to
,
make
her
perhaps
almost
as
happy
as
Jane
.
<EOS>
She
see
her
in
idea
settle
in
that
very
house
in
all
the
felicity
which
a
marriage
of
true
affection
could
bestow
;
and
she
feel
capable
under
such
circumstance
,
of
endeavour
even
to
like
Bingley
's
two
sister
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
's
thought
she
plainly
see
be
bent
the
same
way
,
and
she
determine
not
to
venture
near
her
,
lest
she
may
hear
too
much
.
<EOS>
when
they
sit
down
to
supper
,
therefore
,
she
consider
it
a
most
unlucky
perverseness
which
place
them
within
one
of
each
other
;
and
deeply
be
she
vex
to
find
that
her
mother
be
talk
to
that
one
person
(
Lady
Lucas
)
freely
,
openly
,
and
of
nothing
else
but
of
her
expectation
that
Jane
would
be
soon
marry
to
Mr.
Bingley
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
animate
subject
,
and
Mrs.
Bennet
seem
incapable
of
fatigue
while
enumerate
the
advantage
of
the
match
.
<EOS>
His
be
such
a
charming
young
man
,
and
so
rich
,
and
living
but
three
mile
from
them
,
be
the
first
point
of
self
-
gratulation
;
and
then
it
be
such
a
comfort
to
think
how
fond
the
two
sister
be
of
Jane
,
and
to
be
certain
that
they
must
desire
the
connection
as
much
as
she
could
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
moreover
,
such
a
promising
thing
for
her
young
daughter
,
as
Jane
's
marrying
so
greatly
must
throw
them
in
the
way
of
other
rich
man
;
and
lastly
,
it
be
so
pleasant
at
her
time
of
life
to
be
able
to
consign
her
single
daughter
to
the
care
of
their
sister
,
that
she
may
not
be
oblige
to
go
into
company
more
than
she
like
.
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
to
make
this
circumstance
a
matter
of
pleasure
,
because
on
such
occasion
it
be
the
etiquette
;
but
no
one
be
less
likely
than
Mrs.
Bennet
to
find
comfort
in
stay
at
home
at
any
period
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
She
conclude
with
many
good
wish
that
Lady
Lucas
may
soon
be
equally
fortunate
,
though
evidently
and
triumphantly
believe
there
be
no
chance
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
vain
do
Elizabeth
endeavour
to
check
the
rapidity
of
her
mother
's
word
,
or
persuade
her
to
describe
her
felicity
in
a
less
audible
whisper
;
for
to
her
inexpressible
vexation
,
she
could
perceive
that
the
chief
of
it
be
overhear
by
Mr.
Darcy
,
who
sit
opposite
to
them
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
only
scold
her
for
be
nonsensical
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
Mr.
Darcy
to
me
,
pray
,
that
I
should
be
afraid
of
him
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
we
owe
him
no
such
particular
civility
as
to
be
oblige
to
say
nothing
_
<EOS>
he
_
may
not
like
to
hear

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
for
heaven
's
sake
,
madam
,
speak
lower
.
 
<EOS>
what
advantage
can
it
be
to
you
to
offend
Mr.
Darcy
?
 
<EOS>
You
will
never
recommend
yourself
to
his
friend
by
so
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
nothing
that
she
could
say
,
however
,
have
any
influence
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
would
talk
of
her
view
in
the
same
intelligible
tone
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
blush
and
blush
again
with
shame
and
vexation
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
help
frequently
glance
her
eye
at
Mr.
Darcy
,
though
every
glance
convince
her
of
what
she
dread
;
for
though
he
be
not
always
look
at
her
mother
,
she
be
convince
that
his
attention
be
invariably
fix
by
her
.
<EOS>
the
expression
of
his
face
change
gradually
from
indignant
contempt
to
a
composed
and
steady
gravity
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
however
Mrs.
Bennet
have
no
more
to
say
;
and
Lady
Lucas
,
who
have
be
long
yawn
at
the
repetition
of
delight
which
she
see
no
likelihood
of
sharing
,
be
leave
to
the
comfort
of
cold
ham
and
chicken
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
now
begin
to
revive
.
<EOS>
but
not
long
be
the
interval
of
tranquillity
;
for
when
supper
be
over
,
singing
be
talk
of
,
and
she
have
the
mortification
of
see
Mary
,
after
very
little
entreaty
,
prepare
to
oblige
the
company
.
<EOS>
by
many
significant
look
and
silent
entreaty
,
do
she
endeavour
to
prevent
such
a
proof
of
complaisance
,
 
but
in
vain
;
Mary
would
not
understand
them
;
such
an
opportunity
of
exhibit
be
delightful
to
her
,
and
she
begin
her
song
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
's
eye
be
fix
on
her
with
most
painful
sensation
;
and
she
watch
her
progress
through
the
several
stanza
with
an
impatience
which
be
very
ill
reward
at
their
close
;
for
Mary
,
on
receive
amongst
the
thank
of
the
table
,
the
hint
of
a
hope
that
she
may
be
prevail
on
to
favour
them
again
,
after
the
pause
of
half
a
minute
begin
another
.
<EOS>
Mary
's
power
be
by
no
mean
fit
for
such
a
display
;
her
voice
be
weak
,
and
her
manner
affect
.
 
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
in
agony
.
<EOS>
She
look
at
Jane
,
to
see
how
she
bear
it
;
but
Jane
be
very
composedly
talk
to
Bingley
.
<EOS>
She
look
at
his
two
sister
,
and
see
them
make
sign
of
derision
at
each
other
,
and
at
Darcy
,
who
continue
however
impenetrably
grave
.
<EOS>
She
look
at
her
father
to
entreat
his
interference
,
lest
Mary
should
be
singe
all
night
.
<EOS>
He
take
the
hint
,
and
when
Mary
have
finish
her
second
song
,
say
aloud
,
  
"
that
will
do
extremely
well
,
child
.
<EOS>
You
have
delight
us
long
enough
.
<EOS>
let
the
other
young
lady
have
time
to
exhibit
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
,
though
pretend
not
to
hear
,
be
somewhat
disconcert
;
and
Elizabeth
sorry
for
her
,
and
sorry
for
her
father
's
speech
,
be
afraid
her
anxiety
have
do
no
good
.
 
<EOS>
other
of
the
party
be
now
apply
to
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
,
"
say
Mr.
Collins
,
"
be
so
fortunate
as
to
be
able
to
sing
,
I
should
have
great
pleasure
,
I
be
sure
,
in
oblige
the
company
with
an
air
;
for
I
consider
music
as
a
very
innocent
diversion
,
and
perfectly
compatible
with
the
profession
of
a
clergyman
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
however
to
assert
that
we
can
be
justify
in
devote
too
much
of
our
time
to
music
,
for
there
be
certainly
other
thing
to
be
attend
to
.
<EOS>
the
rector
of
a
parish
have
much
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
he
must
make
such
an
agreement
for
tythe
as
may
be
beneficial
to
himself
and
not
offensive
to
his
patron
.
<EOS>
He
must
write
his
own
sermon
;
and
the
time
that
remain
will
not
be
too
much
for
his
parish
duty
,
and
the
care
and
improvement
of
his
dwelling
,
which
he
can
not
be
excuse
from
make
as
comfortable
as
possible
.
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
think
it
of
light
importance
that
he
should
have
attentive
and
conciliatory
manner
towards
every
body
,
especially
towards
those
to
whom
he
owe
his
preferment
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
acquit
him
of
that
duty
;
nor
could
I
think
well
of
the
man
who
should
omit
an
occasion
of
testify
his
respect
towards
any
body
connect
with
the
family
.
"
<EOS>
and
with
a
bow
to
Mr.
Darcy
,
he
conclude
his
speech
,
which
have
be
speak
so
loud
as
to
be
hear
by
half
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
many
stare
.
 
<EOS>
many
smile
;
but
no
one
look
more
amused
than
Mr.
Bennet
himself
,
while
his
wife
seriously
commend
Mr.
Collins
for
have
speak
so
sensibly
,
and
observe
in
a
half
-
whisper
to
Lady
Lucas
,
that
he
be
a
remarkably
clever
,
good
kind
of
young
man
.
  
<EOS>
to
Elizabeth
it
appear
,
that
have
her
family
make
an
agreement
to
expose
themselves
as
much
as
they
could
during
the
evening
,
it
would
have
be
impossible
for
them
to
play
their
part
with
more
spirit
,
or
fine
success
;
and
happy
<EOS>
do
she
think
it
for
Bingley
and
her
sister
that
some
of
the
exhibition
have
escape
his
notice
,
and
that
his
feeling
be
not
of
a
sort
to
be
much
distress
by
the
folly
which
he
must
have
witness
.
<EOS>
that
his
two
sister
and
Mr.
Darcy
,
however
,
should
have
such
an
opportunity
of
ridicule
her
relation
be
bad
enough
,
and
she
could
not
determine
whether
the
silent
contempt
of
the
gentleman
,
or
the
insolent
smile
of
the
lady
,
be
more
intolerable
.
  
<EOS>
the
rest
of
the
evening
bring
her
little
amusement
.
<EOS>
She
be
teaze
by
Mr.
Collins
,
who
continue
most
perseveringly
by
her
side
,
and
though
he
could
not
prevail
with
her
to
dance
with
him
again
,
put
it
out
of
her
power
to
dance
with
other
.
<EOS>
in
vain
do
she
entreat
him
to
stand
up
with
somebody
else
,
and
offer
to
introduce
him
to
any
young
lady
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
assure
her
that
as
to
dancing
,
he
be
perfectly
indifferent
to
it
;
that
his
chief
object
be
by
delicate
attention
to
recommend
himself
to
her
,
and
that
he
should
therefore
make
a
point
of
remain
close
to
her
the
whole
evening
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
arguing
upon
such
a
project
.
<EOS>
She
owe
her
great
relief
to
her
friend
Miss
Lucas
,
who
often
join
them
,
and
good
-
naturedly
engage
Mr.
Collins
's
conversation
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
at
least
free
from
the
offence
of
Mr.
Darcy
's
farther
notice
;
though
often
stand
within
a
very
short
distance
of
her
,
quite
disengaged
,
he
never
come
near
enough
to
speak
.
<EOS>
She
feel
it
to
be
the
probable
consequence
of
her
allusion
to
Mr.
Wickham
,
and
rejoice
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
Longbourn
party
be
the
last
of
all
the
company
to
depart
;
and
by
a
manoeuvre
of
Mrs.
Bennet
have
to
wait
for
their
carriage
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
every
body
else
be
go
,
which
give
them
time
to
see
how
heartily
they
be
wish
away
by
some
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hurst
and
her
sister
scarcely
open
their
mouth
except
to
complain
of
fatigue
,
and
be
evidently
impatient
to
have
the
house
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
They
repulse
every
attempt
of
Mrs.
Bennet
at
conversation
,
and
by
so
do
,
throw
a
languor
over
the
whole
party
,
which
be
very
little
relieve
by
the
long
speech
of
Mr.
Collins
,
who
be
compliment
Mr.
Bingley
and
his
sister
on
the
elegance
of
their
entertainment
,
and
the
hospitality
and
politeness
which
have
mark
their
behaviour
to
their
guest
.
<EOS>
Darcy
say
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bennet
,
in
equal
silence
,
be
enjoy
the
scene
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bingley
and
Jane
be
stand
together
,
a
little
detach
from
the
rest
,
and
talk
only
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
preserve
as
steady
a
silence
as
either
Mrs.
Hurst
or
Miss
Bingley
;
and
even
Lydia
be
too
much
fatigue
to
utter
more
than
the
occasional
exclamation
of
"
Lord
,
how
tired
I
be
!
"
<EOS>
accompany
by
a
violent
yawn
.
  
<EOS>
when
at
length
they
arise
to
take
leave
,
Mrs.
Bennet
be
most
pressingly
civil
in
her
hope
of
see
the
whole
family
soon
at
Longbourn
;
and
address
herself
particularly
to
Mr.
Bingley
,
to
assure
him
how
happy
he
would
make
them
,
by
eat
a
family
dinner
with
them
at
any
time
,
without
the
ceremony
of
a
formal
invitation
.
<EOS>
Bingley
be
all
grateful
pleasure
,
and
he
readily
engage
for
take
the
early
opportunity
of
wait
on
her
,
after
his
return
from
London
,
whither
he
be
oblige
to
go
the
next
day
for
a
short
time
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
be
perfectly
satisfied
;
and
quit
the
house
under
the
delightful
persuasion
that
,
allow
for
the
necessary
preparation
of
settlement
,
new
carriage
and
wedding
clothe
,
she
should
undoubtedly
see
her
daughter
settle
at
Netherfield
,
in
the
course
of
three
or
four
month
.
<EOS>
of
have
another
daughter
marry
to
Mr.
Collins
,
she
think
with
equal
certainty
,
and
with
considerable
,
though
not
equal
,
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
the
least
dear
to
her
of
all
her
child
;
and
though
the
man
and
the
match
be
quite
good
enough
for
_
her
_
,
the
worth
of
each
be
eclipse
by
Mr.
Bingley
and
Netherfield
.
    
<EOS>
the
next
day
open
a
new
scene
at
Longbourn
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
make
his
declaration
in
form
.
<EOS>
have
resolve
to
do
it
without
loss
of
time
,
as
his
leave
of
absence
extend
only
to
the
follow
Saturday
,
and
have
no
feeling
of
diffidence
to
make
it
distress
to
himself
even
at
the
moment
,
he
set
about
it
in
a
very
orderly
manner
,
with
all
the
observance
which
he
suppose
a
regular
part
of
the
business
.
<EOS>
on
find
Mrs.
Bennet
,
Elizabeth
,
and
one
of
the
young
girl
together
,
soon
after
breakfast
,
he
address
the
mother
in
these
word
,
  
<EOS>
"
May

<EOS>
before
Elizabeth
have
time
for
any
thing
but
a
blush
of
surprise

Mrs.
Bennet
instantly
answer
,
  
"
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
yes
 
certainly

"
Lizzy

upon
your
staying

Mr.
Collins

"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
would
not
oppose
such
an
injunction
 
and
a
moment
's
consideration
make
her
also
sensible
that
it
would
be
wisest
to
get
it
over
as
soon
and
as
quietly
as
possible
,
she
sit
down
again

and
try
to
conceal

Mrs.
Bennet
and

"

add
to
your
other
perfection

You
would
have
be
less
amiable
in
my
eye
have
there
_
not
<EOS>
_
be
this
little
unwillingness
;
but
allow
me
to
assure
you
that
I
have
your
respect
mother
's
permission
for
this
address
.
<EOS>
You
can
hardly
doubt
the
purport
of
my
discourse
,
however
your
natural
delicacy
may
lead
you
to
dissemble
;
my
attention
have
be
too
mark
to
be
mistake
.
<EOS>
almost
as
soon
as
I
enter
the
house
I
single
you
out
as
the
companion
of
my
future
life
.
<EOS>
but
before
I
be
run
away
with
by
my
feeling
on
this
subject
,
perhaps
it
will
be
advisable
for
me
to
state
my
reason
for
marry
 
and
moreover
for
come
into
Hertfordshire
with
the
design
of
select
a
wife
,
as
I
certainly
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
idea
of
Mr.
Collins
,
with
all
his
solemn
composure
,
be
run
away
with
by
his
feeling
,
make
Elizabeth
so
near
laugh
that
she
could
not
use
the
short
pause
he
allow
in
any
attempt
to
stop
him
farther
,
and
he
continue
:
  
"
My
reason
for
marrying
be
,
first
,
that
I
think
it
a
right
thing
for
every
clergyman
in
easy
circumstance
(
like
myself
)
to
set
the
example
of
matrimony
in
his
parish
.
<EOS>
secondly
,
that
I
be
convince
it
will
add
very
greatly
to
my
happiness
;
and
thirdly
 
which
perhaps
I
ought
to
have
mention
earlier
,
that
it
be
the
particular
advice
and
recommendation
of
the
very
noble
lady
whom
I
have
the
honour
of
call
patroness
.
<EOS>
twice
have
she
condescend
to
give
me
her
opinion
(
unasked
too
!
)
<EOS>
on
this
subject
;
and
it
be
but
<EOS>
the
very
Saturday
night
before
I
leave
Hunsford
 
between
our
pool
at
quadrille
,
while
Mrs.
Jenkinson
be
arrange
Miss
de
Bourgh
's
foot
-
stool
,
that
she
say
,
"
Mr.
Collins
,
you
must
marry
.
<EOS>
a
clergyman
like
you
must
marry
.
 
<EOS>
Chuse
properly
,
chuse
a
gentlewoman
for
_
my
_
sake
;
and
for
your
_
own
_
,
let
her
be
an
active
,
useful
sort
of
person
,
not
bring
up
high
,
but
able
to
make
a
small
income
go
a
good
way
.
<EOS>
this
be
my
advice
.
<EOS>
find
such
a
woman
as
soon
as
you
can
,
bring
her
to
Hunsford
,
and
I
will
visit
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
allow
me
,
by
the
way
,
to
observe
,
my
fair
cousin
,
that
I
do
not
reckon
the
notice
and
kindness
of
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh
as
among
the
least
of
the
advantage
in
my
power
to
offer
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
her
manner
beyond
any
thing
I
can
describe
;
and
your
wit
and
vivacity
<EOS>
I
think
must
be
acceptable
to
her
,
especially
when
temper
with
the
silence
and
respect
which
her
rank
will
inevitably
excite
.
<EOS>
thus
much
for
my
general
intention
in
favour
of
matrimony
;
it
remain
to
be
tell
why
my
view
be
direct
to
Longbourn
instead
of
my
own
neighbourhood
,
where
I
assure
you
there
be
many
amiable
young
woman
.
<EOS>
but
the
fact
be
,
<EOS>
that
be
,
as
I
be
,
to
inherit
this
estate
after
the
death
of
your
honoured
father
,
(
who
,
however
,
may
live
many
year
longer
,
)
<EOS>
I
could
not
satisfy
myself
without
resolve
to
chuse
a
wife
from
among
his
daughter
,
that
the
loss
to
them
may
be
as
little
as
possible
,
when
the
melancholy
event
take
place
 
<EOS>
which
,
however
,
as
I
have
already
say
,
may
not
be
for
several
year
.
<EOS>
this
have
be
my
motive
,
my
fair
cousin
,
and
I
flatter
myself
<EOS>
it
will
not
sink
me
in
your
esteem
.
<EOS>
and
now
nothing
remain
for
me
but
to
assure
you
in
the
most
animated
language
of
the
violence
of
my
affection
.
<EOS>
to
fortune
I
be
perfectly
indifferent
,
and
shall
make
no
demand
of
that
nature
on
your
father
,
since
I
be
well
aware
that
it
could
not
be
comply
with
;
and
that
one
thousand
pound
in
the
4
per
cent
.
<EOS>
which
will
not
be
yours
till
after
your
mother
's
decease
,
be
all
that
you
may
ever
be
entitle
to
.
<EOS>
on
that
head
,
therefore
,
I
shall
be
uniformly
silent
;
and
you
may
assure
yourself
that
no
ungenerous
reproach
shall
ever
pass
my
lip
when
we
be
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
absolutely
necessary
to
interrupt
him
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
too
hasty
,
Sir
,
"
she
cry
.
<EOS>
"
You
forget
that
I
have
make
no
answer
.
<EOS>
let
me
do
it
without
farther
loss
of
time
.
<EOS>
accept
my
thank
for
the
compliment
you
be
pay
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
sensible
of
the
honour
of
your
proposal
,
but
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
do
otherwise
than
decline
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
now
to
learn
,
"
reply
Mr.
Collins
,
with
a
formal
wave
of
the
hand
,
"
that
it
be
usual
with
young
lady
to
reject
the
address
of
the
man
whom
they
secretly
mean
to
accept
,
when
he
first
apply
for
their
favour
;
and
that
sometimes
the
refusal
be
repeat
a
second
or
even
a
third
time
.
<EOS>
I
be
therefore
by
no
mean
discourage
by
what
you
have
just
say
,

shall
hope
to
lead
you
to
the
altar
ere
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
Sir
,
"
cry
Elizabeth
,
"
your
hope
be
rather
an
extraordinary
one
after
my
declaration
.
<EOS>
I
do
assure
you
that
I
be
not
one
of
those
young
lady
(
if
such
young

there
be

who
be
so
daring
as
to
risk
their
happiness
on
the
chance
of
be
ask
a
second
time

<EOS>
I
be
perfectly
serious
in
my
refusal
.
 
<EOS>
You
could
not
make
_
me
_
happy
,
and
I
be
convinced
that
I
be
the
last
woman
in
the
world
who
would
make
_
<EOS>
you
_
<EOS>
so
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
be
your
friend
Lady
Catherine
to
know
me
,
I
be
persuade
she
would
find
me
in
every
respect
ill
qualify
for
the
situation

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
certain
that
Lady
Catherine
would
think
so
,
"
say
Mr.
Collins
very
gravely
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
can
not
imagine
that
her
ladyship
would
at
all
disapprove
of
you
.
<EOS>
and
you
may
be
certain
that
when
I
have
the
honour
of
see
her
again
I
shall
speak
in
the
high
term
of
your
modesty
,
economy
,
and
other
amiable
qualification
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
indeed
,
Mr.
Collins
,
all
praise
of
me
will
be
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
You
must
give
me
leave
to
judge
for
myself
,
and
pay
me
the
compliment
of
believe
what
I
say

<EOS>
I
wish
you
very
happy

very
rich

by
refuse
your
hand

do
all
in
my
power
to
prevent
your

otherwise

<EOS>
in
make
me
the
offer

the
delicacy
of
your
feeling
with
regard

take
possession
of
Longbourn
estate

<EOS>

rise
as
she
thus

she
would
have
quit
the
room

not
Mr.

her

when
I
do
myself
the
honour

to
you
next
on
this
subject
I
shall
hope
to
receive
a
more
favourable
answer
than
you
have
now
give
me
;
though
I
be
far
from
accuse
you
of
cruelty
at
present

because
I
know
it
to
be
the
establish
custom
of
your
sex
to
reject
a
man
on
the
first
application
,
and
perhaps
you
have
even
now
say
as
much
to
encourage
my
suit
as
would
be
consistent
with
the
true
delicacy
of
the
female
character

<EOS>
"
  
"
really
,
Mr.
Collins
,
"
cry
Elizabeth
with
some
warmth
,
"
you
puzzle
me
exceedingly
.
<EOS>
if
what
I
have
hitherto
say
can
appear
to
you
in
the
form
of
encouragement
,
I
know
not
how
to
express
my
refusal
in
such
a
way
as
may
convince
you
of
its
be
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
give
me
leave
to
flatter
myself
,
my
dear
cousin
,
that
your
refusal
of
my
address
be
merely
word
of
course
.
<EOS>
My
reason
for
believe
it
be
briefly
these
:
 
<EOS>
It
do
not
appear
to
me
that
my
hand
be
unworthy
your
acceptance
,
or
that
the
establishment
I
can
offer
would
be
any
other
than
highly
desirable
.
<EOS>
My
situation
in
life
,
my
connection
with
the
family
of
De
Bourgh
,
and
my
relationship
to
your
own
,
be
circumstance
highly
in
my
favour
;
and
you
should
take
it
into
farth
consideration
that
in
spite
of
your
manifold
attraction
,
it
be
by
no
means
certain
that
another
offer
of
marriage
may
ever
be
make
you
.
<EOS>
Your
portion
be
unhappily
so
small
that
it
will
in
all
likelihood
undo
the
effect
of
your
loveliness
and
amiable
qualification
.
<EOS>
as
I
must
therefore
conclude
that
you
be
not
serious
in
your
rejection
of
me
,
I
shall
chuse
to
attribute
it
to
your
wish
of
increase
my
love
by
suspense
,
accord
to
the
usual
practice
of
elegant
female
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
assure
you
,
Sir
,
that
I
have
no
pretension
<EOS>
whatever
to
that
kind
of
elegance
which
consist
in
torment
a
respectable
man
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
be
pay
the
compliment
of
be
believe
sincere
.
<EOS>
I
thank
you
again
and
again
for
the
honour
you
have
do
me
in
your
proposal
,
but
to
accept
them
be
absolutely
impossible
.
<EOS>
My
feeling
in
every
respect
forbid
it
.
<EOS>
Can
I
speak
plainer
?
<EOS>
do
not
consider
me
now
as
an
elegant
female
intending
to
plague
you
,
but
as
a
rational
creature
speak
the
truth
from
her
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
uniformly
charming
!
"
<EOS>
cry
he
,
with
an
air
of
awkward
gallantry
;
"
and
I
be
persuade
that
when
sanction
by
the
express
authority
of
both
your
excellent
parent
,
my
proposal
will
not
fail
of
be
acceptable
.
"
  
<EOS>
to
such
perseverance
in
wilful
self
-
deception
Elizabeth
would
make
no
reply
,
and
immediately
and
in
silence
withdraw
;
determine
,
if
he
persist
in
consider
her
repeat
refusal
as
flattering
encouragement
,
to
apply
to
her
father
,
whose
negative
may
be
utter
in
such
a
manner
as
must
be
decisive
,
and
whose
behaviour
at
least
could
not
be
mistake
for
the
affectation
and
coquetry
of
an
elegant
female
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
be
not
leave
long
to
the
silent
contemplation
of
his
successful
love
;
for
Mrs.
Bennet
,
have
dawdle
about
in
the
vestibule
to
watch
for
the
end
of
the
conference
,
no
sooner
see
Elizabeth
open
the
door
and
with
quick
step
pass
her
towards
the
staircase
,
than
she
enter
the
breakfast
-
room
,
and
congratulate
both
him
and
herself
in
warm
term
on
the
happy
prospect
of
their
near
connection
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
receive
and
return
these
felicitation
with
equal
pleasure
,
and
then
proceed
to
relate
the
particular
of
their
interview
,
with
the
result
of
which
he
trust
he
have
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
,
since
the
refusal
which
his
cousin
have
steadfastly
give
him
would
naturally
flow
from
her
bashful
modesty
and
the
genuine
delicacy
of
her
character
.
  
<EOS>
this
information
,
however
,
startle
Mrs.
Bennet
;
 
she
would
have
be
glad
to
be
equally
satisfied
that
her
daughter
have
mean
to
encourage
him
by
protest
against
his
proposal
,
but
she
dare
not
to
believe
it
,
and
could
not
help
say
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
depend
upon
it
,
Mr.
Collins
,
"
she
add
,
"
that
Lizzy
shall
be
bring
to
reason
.
<EOS>
I
will
speak
to
her
about
it
myself
directly
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
very
headstrong
foolish
girl
,
and
do
not
know
her
own
interest

but
I
will

make
_
her
know
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
pardon
me
for
interrupt
you

Madam

Mr.
Collins
;

but
if
she
be
really
headstrong

foolish
<EOS>

I
know
not
whether
she
would
altogether
be
a
very
desirable
wife
to
a
man
in
my
situation
,
who
naturally
look
for
happiness
in
the
marriage
state

<EOS>
if
therefore
she
actually
persist
in
reject
my
suit
,
perhaps
it
be
well
not
to
force
her
into
accept
me
,
because
if
liable
to
such
defect
of
temper

she
could
not

much
to

I
have
send
for
you

an
affair

I
understand
that
Mr.

I
have

Sir

We

point

Your

not
it
so

Mrs.

yes

I
will
never

<EOS>

an
unhappy
alternative
be
before
you
,
Elizabeth

<EOS>
from
this
day
you
must
be
a
stranger
to
one
of
your
parent
.
 
<EOS>
Your
mother
will
never
see
you
again
if
you
do

<EOS>
not

marry
Mr.

I
will
never

you
again

you

"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
could
not
but
smile
at
such
a
conclusion
of
such
a
beginning
;
but
Mrs.
Bennet
,
who
have
persuade
herself
that
her
husband
regard
the
affair
as
she
wish
,
be
excessively
disappointed
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
,
Mr.
Bennet
,
by
talk
in
this
way
?
<EOS>
You
promise
me
to
_
insist
_
upon
her
marry
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
reply
her
husband
,
"
I
have
two
small
favour
to
request
.
<EOS>
first
,
that
you
will
allow
me
the
free
use
of
my
understanding
on
the
present
occasion
;
and
secondly
,
of
my
room
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
glad
to
have
the
library
to
myself
as
soon
as
may
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
not
yet
,
however
,
in
spite
of
her
disappointment
in
her
husband
,
do
Mrs.
Bennet
give
up
the
point
.
<EOS>
She
talk
to
Elizabeth
again
and
again
;
coax
and
threaten
her
by
turn
.
<EOS>
She
endeavour
to
secure
Jane
in
her
interest
,
but
Jane
with
all
possible
mildness
decline
interfere
;
 
and
Elizabeth
sometimes
with
real
earnestness
and
sometimes
with
playful
gaiety
reply
to
her
attack
.
<EOS>
though
her
manner
vary
however
,
her
determination
never
do
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
,
meanwhile
,
be
meditate
in
solitude
on
what
have
pass
.
<EOS>
He
think
too
well
of
himself
to
comprehend
on
what
motive
his
cousin
could
refuse
him
;
and
though
his
pride
be
hurt
,
he
suffer
in
no
other
way
.
<EOS>
His
regard
for
her
be
quite
imaginary
;
and
the
possibility
of
her
deserve
her
mother
's
reproach
prevent
his
feeling
any
regret

<EOS>
while
the
family

confusion

Charlotte

the
day

She
be

in

half
whisper

<EOS>
Charlotte
have
hardly
time
to
answer
,
before
they
be
join
by
Kitty
,
who
come
to
tell
the
same
news
,
and
no
sooner
have
they
enter
the
breakfast
-
room
,
where
Mrs.
Bennet
be
alone
,
than
she
likewise
begin
on
the
subject
,
call
on
Miss
Lucas
for
her
compassion
,
and
entreat
her
to
persuade
her
friend
Lizzy
to
comply
with
the
wish
of
all
her
family

<EOS>
"
Pray
do
,
my

Miss

she
add
in
a
melancholy
tone
,
"
for
nobody

on
my
side

nobody

part

me

I
be
cruelly
use

nobody

my
poor

<EOS>
Charlotte
's
reply
be
spare
by
the
entrance
of
Jane
and
Elizabeth
.
  
<EOS>
"
aye
,
there
she
come

continue
Mrs.
Bennet
,
"
look
as
unconcerned
as
may
be

no
more
for
us

if
we
be
at
York

she
can
have
her
own
way

<EOS>
but
I
tell
you
what
,
Miss
Lizzy
,
if
you
take
it
into
your
head
to
go
on
refuse
every
offer
of
marriage
in
this
way

you
will
never
get
a

at
all

I
be

I
do
not

you

I
have
do
with
you
from

very
day

I
tell
you
in
the

you
know

that
I
should
never

you
again

me

good

no
pleasure
in
talk
to
undutiful
child

<EOS>
not
that
I
have
much
pleasure
indeed
in
talk
to
any
body

<EOS>
People
who
suffer
as
I
do
from
nervous
complaint
can
have
no
great
inclination
for
talk
.
<EOS>
nobody
can
tell
what
I
suffer
!
 
<EOS>

it
be
always
so

<EOS>
those
who
do
not
complain
be
never
pity

<EOS>
Her
daughter
listen
in
silence
to
this
effusion
,
sensible
that
any
attempt
to
reason
with
or
sooth
her
would
only
increase
the
irritation
.
<EOS>
She
talk
on
,
therefore
,
without
interruption
from
any
of
them
till
they
be
join
by
Mr.
Collins

who
enter
with
an
air
more
stately
than

on

Mr.

a
little
conversation
together

<EOS>
Elizabeth
pass
quietly
out
of
the
room
,
Jane
and
Kitty
follow
,
but
Lydia
stand
her
ground
,
determine
to
hear
all
she
could
;
and
Charlotte
,
detain
first
by
the
civility
of
Mr.
Collins
,
whose
inquiry
after
herself
and
all
her
family
be
very
minute
,
and
then
by
a
little
curiosity
,
satisfy
herself
with
walk
to
the
window
and
pretend
not
to
hear
.
<EOS>
in
a
doleful
voice
Mrs.
Bennet
thus
begin
the
project
conversation

<EOS>
"
oh
!
Mr.
Collins
!

My
dear
Madam

let
us
be
for
ever
silent

this
point

be
it
from
me

he
presently
continue
in
a
voice
that
mark
his
displeasure
,
"
to
resent
the
behaviour
of
your
daughter

<EOS>
resignation
to
inevitable
evil
be
the
duty
of
us
all

the
peculiar
duty
of
a
young
man
who
have
be
so
fortunate
as
I
have
be
in
early
preferment
;
and
I
trust
I
be
resign
.
<EOS>
perhaps
not
the
less
so
from
feel
a
doubt
of
my
positive
happiness
have
my
fair
cousin
honour
me
with
her
hand
;
for
I
have
often
observe
that
resignation
be
never
so
perfect
as
when
the
blessing
deny
begin
to
lose
somewhat
of
its
value
in
our
estimation

You
will
not

I
hope
,
consider
me
as
shew
any
disrespect
to
your
family

my
dear
Madam

withdraw
my
pretension
to
your
daughter

favour

pay
yourself

Mr.

the
compliment

request
you
to
interpose
your
authority
in
my
behalf

My
conduct

may
I
fear
be
objectionable
in
have
accept
my
dismission
from
your
daughter
's
lip
instead
of
your
own
.
<EOS>
but
we
be
all
liable
to
error
.
<EOS>
I
have
certainly
mean
well
through
the
whole
affair
.
<EOS>
My
object
have
be
to
secure
an
amiable
companion
for
myself
,
with
due
consideration
for
the
advantage
of
all
your
family
,
and
if
my

manner

have
be
at
all
reprehensible
,
I
here
beg
leave
to
apologise

"
    
<EOS>
the
discussion
of
Mr.
Collins
's
offer
be
now
nearly
at
an
end
,
and
Elizabeth
have
only
to
suffer
from
the
uncomfortable
feeling
necessarily
attend
it
,
and
occasionally
from
some
peevish
allusion
of
her
mother
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
gentleman
himself
,
_
his
_
feeling
be
chiefly
express
,
not
by
embarrassment
or
dejection
,
or
by
try
to
avoid
her
,
but
by
stiffness
of
manner
and
resentful
silence
.
<EOS>
He
scarcely
ever
speak
to
her
,
and
the
assiduous
attention
which
he
have
be
so
sensible
of
himself
,
be
transfer
for
the
rest
of
the
day
to
Miss
Lucas
,
whose
civility
in
listen
to
him
,
be
a
seasonable
relief
to
them
all

and
especially
to
her
friend

<EOS>
the
morrow
produce
no
abatement
of
Mrs.
Bennet
's
ill
humour
or
ill
health
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
be
also
in
the
same
state
of
angry
pride
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
have
hope
that
his
resentment
may
shorten
his
visit
,
but
his
plan
do
not
appear
in
the
least
affected
by
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
always
to
have
go
on
Saturday
,
and
to
Saturday
he
still
mean
to
stay
.
  
<EOS>
after
breakfast
,
the
girl
walk
to
Meryton
to
inquire
if
Mr.
Wickham
be
return
,
and
to
lament
over
his
absence
from
the
Netherfield
ball
.
<EOS>
He
join
them
on
their
enter
the
town
and
attend
them
to
their
aunt

,
where
his
regret
and
vexation
,

the
concern
of
every
body
be
well
talk
over

to
Elizabeth

he
voluntarily
acknowledge
that

be
in

room
,
the
same
party
with
him
for
so
many
hour
together

may
be
more
than
I
could
bear

that
scene
may
arise
unpleasant
to
more
than
myself

"
  
<EOS>
She
highly
approve
his
forbearance
,
and
they
have
leisure
for
a
full
discussion
of
it
,
and
for
all
the
commendation
which
they
civilly
bestow
on
each
other
,
as
Wickham
and
another
officer
walk
back
with
them
to
Longbourn
,
and
during
the
walk
,
he
particularly
attend
to
her

<EOS>
His
accompany
them
be
a
double
advantage
;
she
feel
all
the
compliment
it
offer
to
herself
,
and
it
be
most
acceptable
as
an
occasion
of
introduce
him
to
her
father
and
mother

<EOS>
soon
after
their
return
,
a
letter
be

Miss
Bennet

it
come
from
Netherfield

be
open
immediately

<EOS>
the
envelope

a
sheet
of
elegant

little
,
hot
pressed
paper
,
well
cover
with
a
lady

fair
,
flow
hand

and
Elizabeth
see
her
sister
's
countenance
change
as
she
read
it
,
and
see
her
dwelling
intently
on
some
particular
passage
.
<EOS>
Jane
recollect
herself
soon
,
and
put
the
letter
away
,
try
to
join
with
her
usual
cheerfulness
in
the
general
conversation
;
but
Elizabeth
feel
an
anxiety
on
the
subject
which
draw
off
her
attention
even
from
Wickham
;
and
no
sooner
have
he
and
his
companion
take
leave
,
than
a
glance
from
Jane
invite
her
to
follow
her
up
stair

<EOS>
when
they
have
gain
their

Jane
take
out
the
letter

this

from
Caroline
Bingley

surprise
me
a
good
deal

party
have
leave
Netherfield
by
this
time

be
on
their
way
to
town

without
any
intention

come
back
again
.
<EOS>
You
shall
hear
what
she
say

She
then
read
the
first
sentence
aloud
,
which
comprise
the
information
of
their
have
just
resolve
to
follow
their
brother
to
town
directly
,
and
of
their
meaning
to
dine
that
day
in
Grosvenor
street
,
where
Mr.
Hurst
have
a
house
.
<EOS>
the
next
be
in
these
word

"
I
do
not
pretend
to
regret
any
thing
I
shall
leave
in
Hertfordshire
,
except
your
society

but
we
will
hope
at
some
future
period
,
to
enjoy
many
return
of
the
delightful
intercourse
we
have
know
,
and
in
the
mean
while
may
lessen
the
pain
of
separation
by
a
very
frequent
and
most
unreserved
correspondence
.

I
depend
on
you
for
that

<EOS>
to
these
high
fly
expression
,
Elizabeth
listen
with
all
the
insensibility
of
distrust
;
and
though
the
suddenness
of
their
removal
surprise
her
,
she
see
nothing
in
it
really
to
lament
;
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
their
absence
from
Netherfield
would
prevent
Mr.
Bingley
's
be
there
;
and
as
to
the
loss
of
their
society

she
be
persuade
that
Jane
must
soon
cease
to
regard
it
,
in
the
enjoyment
of
his
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
unlucky
,
"
say
she
,
after
a
short
pause
,
"
that
you
should
not
be
able
to
see
your
friend
before
they
leave
the
country

<EOS>
but
may
we
not
hope
that
the
period
of
future
happiness
to
which
Miss
Bingley
look
forward
,
may
arrive
earlier
than
she
be
aware
,
and
that
the
delightful
intercourse
you
have
know
as
friend
,
will
be
renew
with
yet
great
satisfaction
as
sister

<EOS>
Mr.
Bingley
will
not
be
detain
in
London
by
them

"
  
<EOS>
"
Caroline
decidedly
say
that
none
of
the
party
will
return
into
Hertfordshire
this
winter
.

I
will
read
it
to
you

when
my
brother
leave
us
yesterday
,
he
imagine
that
the
business
which
take
him
to
London
,
may
be
conclude
in
three
or
four
day
,
but
as
we
be
certain
it
can
not
be
so
,
and
at
the
same
time
convince
that
when
Charles
get
to
town
,
he
will
be
in
no
hurry
to
leave
it
again
,
we
have
determine
on
follow
him
thither

that
he
may
not

spend
his
vacant
hour
in
a
comfortless
hotel

many

I
could
hear

any

make
one

of
that
I
despair

I
sincerely
hope
your
Christmas
in
Hertfordshire
may
abound
in
the
gaiety
which
that
season
generally
bring

that
your
beaux

be
so
numerous

Mr.
Darcy
be
impatient
to
see
his
sister
,
and
to
confess
the
truth
,
_
we
_
be
scarcely
less
eager
to
meet
her
again
.
<EOS>
I
really
do
not
think
Georgiana
Darcy
have
her
equal
for
beauty
,
elegance
,
and
accomplishment
;
and
the
affection
she
inspire
in
Louisa
and
myself
,
be
heighten
into
something
still
more
interesting
,
from
the
hope
we
dare
to
entertain
of
her

hereafter
<EOS>
our
sister
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
I
ever

to
you
my

but
I
will
not
leave
the
country
without
confide
them
,
and
I
trust
you
will
not
esteem
them
unreasonable

<EOS>
My

admire
her
greatly
already

he
will
have
frequent
opportunity
now
of
see
her
on
the
most
intimate

partiality

not

I
think
,
when
I

most

<EOS>
with

<EOS>
do
it

that

You

<EOS>
Miss
Bingley
see
that
her

and
want
him
to

Miss

<EOS>
She
follow
him
to
town
in
the
hope
of
keep
him
there
,
and
try
to
persuade
you
that
he
do
not

about
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jane
shake
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
Jane
,
you
ought
to
believe
me
.
 
<EOS>
no
one
who
have
ever
see
you
together
,
can
doubt
his
affection
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bingley
I
be
sure
can
not
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
such
a
simpleton
.
<EOS>
Could
she
have
see
half
as
much
love
in
Mr.
Darcy
for
herself
,
she
would
have
order
her
wedding
clothe
.
<EOS>
but
the
case
be
this
.
<EOS>
We
be
not
rich
enough
,
or
grand
enough
for
them
;
and
she
be
the
more
anxious
to
get
Miss
Darcy
for
her
brother
,
from
the
notion
that
when
there
have
be
_
one
<EOS>
_
intermarriage
,
she
may
have
less
trouble
in
achieve
a
second
;
in
which
there
be
certainly
some
ingenuity
,
and
I
dare
say
it
would
succeed
,
if
Miss
de
Bourgh
be
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
Jane
,
you
can
not
seriously
imagine
that
because
Miss
Bingley
tell
you
her
brother
greatly
admire
Miss
Darcy
,
he
be
in
the
small
degree
less
sensible
of
_
your
_
merit
than
when
he
take
leave
of
you
on
Tuesday
,
or
that
it
will
be
in
her
power
to
persuade
him
that
instead
of
be
in
love
with
you
,
he
be
very
much
in
love
with
her
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
we
think
alike
of
Miss
Bingley
,
"
reply
Jane
,
"
your
representation
of
all
this
,
may
make
me
quite
easy
.
<EOS>
but
I
know
the
foundation
be
unjust
.
<EOS>
Caroline
be
incapable
of
wilfully
deceive
any
one
;
and
all
that
I
can
hope
in
this
case
be
,
that
she
be
deceive
herself

"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
You
could
not
have
start
a
more
happy
idea
,
since
you
will
not
take
comfort
in
mine
.
<EOS>
believe
her
to
be
deceive
by
all
mean

<EOS>
You
have
now
do
your
duty
by
her
,
and
must
fret
no
longer

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
my
dear
sister
,
can
I
be
happy
,
even
suppose
the
good
,
in
accept
a
man
whose
sister

all
wish
him

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
decide
for
yourself

"
say
Elizabeth
,
"
and
if
upon
mature
deliberation
,
you
find
that
the
misery
of
disoblige
his
two
sister
be
more
than
equivalent

the
happiness

be
his

I
advise
you
by
all

refuse
him

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
talk
so

"
 
<EOS>

Jane
faintly

<EOS>

You
must
know
that
though
I
should
be

at

disapprobation

I
could
not

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not

I
can
not
consider

compassion

"
  
<EOS>
"
but
if
he
return
no
more
this
winter
,
my
choice
will
never
be
require

<EOS>
a
thousand
thing
may
arise
in
six
month
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
idea
of
his
return
no
more
Elizabeth
treat
with
the
utmost
contempt
.
<EOS>
It
appear
to
her
merely
the
suggestion
of
Caroline
's
interested
wish
,
and
she
could
not
for
a
moment
suppose
that
those
wish
,
however
openly
or
artfully
speak
,
could
influence
a
young
man
so
totally
independent
of
every
one
.
  
<EOS>
She
represent
to
her
sister
as
forcibly
as
possible
what
she
feel
on
the
subject
,
and
have
soon
the
pleasure
of
see
its
happy
effect
.
<EOS>
Jane
's
temper
be
not
despond
,
and
she
be
gradually
lead
to
hope
,
though
the
diffidence
of
affection
sometimes
overcome
the
hope
,
that
Bingley
would
return
to
Netherfield
and
answer
every
wish
of
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
They
agree
that
Mrs.
Bennet
should
only
hear
of
the
departure
of
the
family
,
without
be
alarm
on
the
score
of
the
gentleman
's
conduct
;
but
even
this
partial
communication
give
her
a
great
deal
of
concern
,
and
she
bewail
it
as
exceedingly
unlucky
that
the
lady
should
happen
to
go
away
,
just
as
they
be
all
get
so
intimate
together
.
<EOS>
after
lament
it
however
at
some
length
,
she
have
the
consolation
of
think
that
Mr.
Bingley
would
be
soon
down
again
and
soon
dine
at
Longbourn
,
and
the
conclusion
of
all
be
the
comfortable
declaration
that
,
though
he
have
be
invite
only
to
a
family
dinner
,
she
would
take
care
to
have
two
full
course
.
    
<EOS>
the
Bennets
be
engage
to
dine
with
the
Lucases
,
and
again
during
the
chief
of
the
day
,
be
Miss
Lucas
so
kind
as
to
listen
to
Mr.
Collins
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
take
an
opportunity
of
thank
her
.
<EOS>
"
It
keep
him
in
good
humour
,
"
say
she
,
"
and
I
be
more
obliged
to
you
than
I
can
express
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Charlotte
assure
her
friend
of
her
satisfaction
in
be
useful
,
and
that
it
amply
repay
her
for
the
little
sacrifice
of
her
time
.
<EOS>
this
be
very
amiable
,
but
Charlotte
's
kindness
extend
farther
than
Elizabeth
have
any
conception
of
;
 
its
object
be
nothing
less
,
than
to
secure
her
from
any
return
of
Mr.
Collins
's
address
,
by
engage
them
towards
herself
.
<EOS>
such
be
Miss
Lucas
's
scheme
;
and
appearance
be
so
favourable
that
when
they
part
at
night
,
she
would
have
feel
almost
sure
of
success
if
he
have
not
be
to
leave
Hertfordshire
so
very
soon
.
<EOS>
but
here
,
she
do
injustice
to
the
fire
and
independence
of
his
character
,
for
it
lead
him
to
escape
out
of
Longbourn
House
the
next
morning
with
admirable
slyness
,
and
hasten
to
Lucas
Lodge
to
throw
himself
at
her
foot
.
<EOS>
He
be
anxious
to
avoid
the
notice
of
his
cousin
,
from
a
conviction
that
if
they
see
him
depart
,
they
could
not
fail
to
conjecture
his
design
,
and
he
be
not
willing
to
have
the
attempt
know
till
its
success
could
be
know
likewise
;
for
though
feel
almost
secure
,
and
with
reason
,
for
Charlotte
have
be
tolerably
encouraging
,
he
be
comparatively
diffident
since
the
adventure
of
Wednesday
.
<EOS>
His
reception
however
be
of
the
most
flattering
kind
.
<EOS>
Miss
Lucas
perceive
him
from
an
upper
window
as
he
walk
towards
the
house
,
and
instantly
set
out
to
meet
him
accidentally
in
the
lane
.
<EOS>
but
little
have
she
dare
to
hope
that
so
much
love
and
eloquence
await
her
there
.
  
<EOS>
in
as
short
a
time
as
Mr.
Collins
's
long
speech
would
allow
,
every
thing
be
settle
between
them
to
the
satisfaction
of
both
;
and
as
they
enter
the
house
,
he
earnestly
entreat
her
to
name
the
day
that
be
to
make
him
the
happy
of
man
;
and
though
such
a
solicitation
must
be
wave
for
the
present
,
the
lady
feel
no
inclination
to
trifle
with
his
happiness
.
<EOS>
the
stupidity
with
which
he
be
favour
by
nature
,
must
guard
his
courtship
from
any
charm
that
could
make
a
woman
wish
for
its
continuance
;
and
Miss
Lucas
,
who
accept
him
solely
from
the
pure
and
disintereste
desire
of
an
establishment
,
care
not
how
soon
that
establishment
be
gain
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
William
and
Lady
Lucas
be
speedily
apply
to
for
their
consent
;
and
it
be
bestow
with
a
most
joyful
alacrity
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
's
present
circumstance
make
it
a
most
eligible
match
for
their
daughter
,
to
whom
they
could
give
little
fortune
;
and
his
prospect
of
future
wealth
be
exceedingly
fair
.
<EOS>
Lady
Lucas
begin
directly
to
calculate
with
more
interest
than
the
matter
have
ever
excite
before
,
how
many
year
longer
Mr.
Bennet
be
likely
to
live
;
and
Sir
William
give
it
as
his
decide
opinion
,
that
whenever
Mr.
Collins
should
be
in
possession
of
the
Longbourn
estate
,
it
would
be
highly
expedient
that
both
he
and
his
wife
should
make
their
appearance
at
St.
James
's
.
<EOS>
the
whole
family
in
short
be
properly
overjoy
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
the
young
girl
form
hope
of
_
come
out
_
a
year
or
two
soon
than
they
may
otherwise
have
do
;
and
the
boy
be
relieve
from
their
apprehension
of
Charlotte
's
die
an
old
maid
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
herself
be
tolerably
compose
.
<EOS>
She
have
gain
her
point
,
and
have
time
to
consider
of
it
.
<EOS>
Her
reflection
be
in
general
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
to
be
sure
be
neither
sensible
nor
agreeable
;
his
society
be
irksome
,
and
his
attachment
to
her
must
be
imaginary
.
<EOS>
but
still
he
would
be
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
without
think
highly
either
of
man
or
of
matrimony
,
marriage
have
always
be
her
object
;
it
be
the
only
honourable
provision
for
well
-
educate
young
woman
of
small
fortune
,
and
however
uncertain
of
give
happiness
,
must
be
their
pleasantest
preservative
from
want
.
<EOS>
this
preservative
she
have
now
obtain
;
and
at
the
age
of
twenty
-
seven
,
without
have
ever
be
handsome
,
she
feel
all
the
good
luck
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
least
agreeable
circumstance
in
the
business
,
be
the
surprise
it
must
occasion
to
Elizabeth
Bennet
,
whose
friendship
she
value
beyond
that
of
any
other
person
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
would
wonder
,
and
probably
would
blame
her
;
and
though
her
resolution
be
not
to
be
shake
,
her
feeling
must
be
hurt
by
such
disapprobation
.
<EOS>
She
resolve
to
give
her
the
information
herself
,
and
therefore
charge
Mr.
Collins
when
he
return
to
Longbourn
to
dinner
,
to
drop
no
hint
of
what
have
pass
before
any
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
a
promise
of
secrecy
be
of
course
very
dutifully
give
,
but
it
could
not
be
keep
without
difficulty
;
for
the
curiosity
excite
by
his
long
absence
,
burst
forth
in
such
very
direct
question
on
his
return
,
as
require
some
ingenuity
to
evade
,
and
he
be
at
the
same
time
exercise
great
self
-
denial
,
for
he
be
long
to
publish
his
prosperous
love
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
be
to
begin
his
journey
too
early
on
the
morrow
to
see
any
of
the
family
,
the
ceremony
of
leave
-
taking
be
perform
when
the
lady
move
for
the
night
;
and
Mrs.
Bennet
with
great
politeness
and
cordiality
say
how
happy
they
should
be
to
see
him
at
Longbourn
again
,
whenever
his
other
engagement
may
allow
him
to
visit
them
.

"
My

he

render
it
necessary
,
I
shall
now
take
the
liberty
of
wish
them
health
and
happiness
,
not
except
my
cousin
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
proper
civility
the
lady
then
withdraw
;
all
of
them
equally
surprised
to
find
that
he
meditate
a
quick
return
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
wish
to
understand
by
it
that
he
think
of
pay
his
address
to
one
of
her
young
girl
,
and
Mary
may
have
be
prevail
on
to
accept
him
.
<EOS>
She
rate
his
ability
much
high
than
any
of
the
other
;
there
be
a
solidity
in
his
reflection
which
often
strike
her
,
and
though
by
no
means
so
clever
as
herself
,
she
think
that
if
encourage
to
read
and
improve
himself
by
such
an
example
as
her
be
,
he
may
become
a
very
agreeable
companion
.
<EOS>
but
on
the
follow
morning
,
every
hope
of
this
kind
be
do
away
.
<EOS>
Miss
Lucas
call
soon
after
breakfast
,
and
in
a
private
conference
with
Elizabeth
relate
the
event
of
the
day
before
.
  
<EOS>
the
possibility
of
Mr.
Collins
's
fancy
himself
in
love
with
her
friend
have
once
occur
to
Elizabeth
within
the
last
day
or
two
;
but
that
Charlotte
could
encourage
him
,
seem
almost
as
far
from
possibility
as
that
she
could
encourage
him
herself
,
and
her
astonishment
be
consequently
so
great
as
to
overcome
at
first
the
bound
of
decorum
,
and
she
could
not
help
cry
out
,
  
"
engage
to
Mr.
Collins
!
<EOS>
my
dear
Charlotte
,
 
impossible
!
"
  
<EOS>
the
steady
countenance
which
Miss
Lucas
have
command
in
tell
her
story
,
give
way
to
a
momentary
confusion
here
on
receive
so
direct
a
reproach
;
though
,
as
it
be
no
more
than
she
expect
,
she
soon
regain
her
composure
,
and
calmly
reply
,
  
"
why
should
you
be
surprised
,
my
dear
Eliza
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
it
incredible
that
Mr.
Collins
should
be
able
to
procure
any
woman
's
good
opinion
,
because
he
be
not
so
happy
as
to
succeed
with
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
Elizabeth
have
now
recollect
herself
,
and
make
a
strong
effort
for
it
,
be
able
to
assure
her
with
tolerable
firmness
that
the
prospect
of
their
relationship
be
highly
grateful
to
her
,
and
that
she
wish
her
all
imaginable
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
what
you
be
feel
,
"
reply
Charlotte
,
 
"
you
must
be
surprised
,
very
much
surprised
,
 
so
lately
as
Mr.
Collins
be
wish
to
marry
you
.
<EOS>
but
when
you
have
have
time
to
think
it
all
over
,
I
hope
you
will
be
satisfied
with
what
I
have
do
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
romantic
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
never
be
.
<EOS>
I
ask
only
a
comfortable
home
;
and
consider
Mr.
Collins
's
character
,
connection
,
and
situation
in
life
,
I
be
convinced
that
my
chance
of
happiness
with
him
be
as
fair
,
as
most
people
can
boast
on
enter
the
marriage
state
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
quietly
answer
"
undoubtedly
;
"
 
and
after
an
awkward
pause
,
they
return
to
the
rest
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
do
not
stay
much
longer
,
and
Elizabeth
be
then
leave
to
reflect
on
what
she
have
hear
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
time
before
she
become
at
all
reconcile
to
the
idea
of
so
unsuitable
a
match
.
<EOS>
the
strangeness
of
Mr.
Collins
's
make
two
offer
of
marriage
within
three
day
,
be
nothing
in
comparison
of
his
be
now
accept
.
<EOS>
She
have
always
feel
that
Charlotte
's
opinion
of
matrimony
be
not
exactly
like
her
own
,
but
she
could
not
have
suppose
it
possible
that
when
call
into
action
,
she
would
have
sacrifice
every
well
feeling
to
worldly
advantage
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
the
wife
of
Mr.
Collins
,
be
a
most
humiliating
picture
!
 
<EOS>
and
to
the
pang
of
a
friend
disgrace
herself
and
sink
in
her
esteem
,
be
add
the
distress
conviction
that
it
be
impossible
for
that
friend
to
be
tolerably
happy
in
the
lot
she
have
choose
.
    
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
sit
with
her
mother
and
sister
,
reflect
on
what
she
have
hear
,
and
doubt
whether
she
be
authorise
to
mention
it
,
when
Sir
William
Lucas
himself
appear
,
send
by
his
daughter
to
announce
her
engagement
to
the
family
.
<EOS>
with
many
compliment
to
them
,
and
much
self
-
gratulation
on
the
prospect
of
a
connection
between
the
house
,
he
unfold
the
matter
,
 
to
an
audience
not
merely
wonder
,
but
incredulous
;
for
Mrs.
Bennet
,
with
more
perseverance
than
politeness
,
protest
he
must
be
entirely
mistaken
,
and
Lydia
,
always
unguarded
and
often
uncivil
,
boisterously
exclaim
,
  
"
Good
Lord
!
<EOS>
Sir
William
,
how
can
you
tell
such
a
story
?
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
know
that
Mr.
Collins
want
to
marry
Lizzy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
nothing
less
than
the
complaisance
of
a
courtier
could
have
bear
without
anger
such
treatment
;
but
Sir
William
's
good
breeding
carry
him
through
it
all
;
and
though
he
beg
leave
to
be
positive
as
to
the
truth
of
his
information
,
he
listen
to
all
their
impertinence
with
the
most
forbear
courtesy
.
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
,
feel
it
incumbent
on
her
to
relieve
him
from
so
unpleasant
a
situation
,
now
put
herself
forward
to
confirm
his
account
,
by
mention
her
prior
knowledge
of
it
from
Charlotte
herself
;
and
endeavour
to
put
a
stop
to
the
exclamation
of
her
mother
and
sister
,
by
the
earnestness
of
her
congratulation
to
Sir
William
,
in
which
she
be
readily
join
by
Jane
,
and
by
make
a
variety
of
remark
on
the
happiness
that
may
be
expect
from
the
match
,
the
excellent
character
of
Mr.
Collins
,
and
the
convenient
distance
of
Hunsford
from
London
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
be
in
fact
too
much
overpower
to
say
a
great
deal
while
Sir
William
remain
;
but
no
sooner
have
he
leave
them
than
her
feeling
find
a
rapid
vent
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
she
persist
in
disbelieve
the
whole
of
the
matter
;
secondly
,
she
be
very
sure
that
Mr.
Collins
have
be
take
in
;
thirdly
,
she
trust
that
they
would
never
be
happy
together
;
and
fourthly
,
that
the
match
may
be
break
off
.
<EOS>
two
inference
,
however
,
be
plainly
deduce
from
the
whole
;
one
,
that
Elizabeth
be
the
real
cause
of
all
the
mischief
;
and
the
other
,
that
she
herself
have
be
barbarously
use
by
them
all
;
and
on
these
two
point
she
principally
dwelt
during
the
rest
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
console
and
nothing
appease
her
.
 
<EOS>
nor
do
that
day
wear
out
her
resentment
.
<EOS>
a
week
elapse
before
she
could
see
Elizabeth
without
scold
her
,
a
month
pass
away
before
she
could
speak
to
Sir
William
or
Lady
Lucas
without
be
rude
,
and
many
month
be
go
before
she
could
at
all
forgive
their
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bennet
's
emotion
be
much
more
tranquil
on
the
occasion
,
and
such
as
he
do
experience
he
pronounce
to
be
of
a
most
agreeable
sort
;
for
it
gratify
him
,
he
say
,
to
discover
that
Charlotte
Lucas
,
whom
he
have
be
use
to
think
tolerably
sensible
,
be
as
foolish
as
his
wife
,
and
more
foolish
than
his
daughter
!
  
<EOS>
Jane
confess
herself
a
little
surprised
at
the
match
;
but
she
say
less
of
her
astonishment
than
of
her
earnest
desire
for
their
happiness
;
nor
could
Elizabeth
persuade
her
to
consider
it
as
improbable
.
<EOS>
Kitty
and
Lydia
be
far
from
envy
Miss
Lucas
,
for
Mr.
Collins
be
only
a
clergyman
;
and
it
affect
them
in
no
other
way
than
as
a
piece
of
news
to
spread
at
Meryton
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Lucas
could
not
be
insensible
of
triumph
on
be
able
to
retort
on
Mrs.
Bennet
the
comfort
of
have
a
daughter
well
married
;
and
she
call
at
Longbourn
rather
oftener
than
usual
to
say
how
happy
she
be
,
though
Mrs.
Bennet
's
sour
look
and
ill
-
natured
remark
may
have
be
enough
to
drive
happiness
away
.
  
<EOS>
between
Elizabeth
and
Charlotte
there
be
a
restraint
which
keep
them
mutually
silent
on
the
subject
;
and
Elizabeth
feel
persuade
that
no
real
confidence
could
ever
subsist
between
them
again
.
<EOS>
Her
disappointment
in
Charlotte
make
her
turn
with
fond
regard
to
her
sister
,
of
whose
rectitude
and
delicacy
<EOS>
she
be
sure
her
opinion
could
never
be
shake
,
and
for
whose
happiness
she
grow
daily
more
anxious
,
as
Bingley
have
now
be
go
a
week
,
and
nothing
be
hear
of
his
return
.
  
<EOS>
Jane
have
send
Caroline
an
early
answer
to
her
letter
,
and
be
count
the
day
till
she
may
reasonably
hope
to
hear
again
.
<EOS>
the
promised
letter
of
thank
from
Mr.
Collins
arrive
on
Tuesday
,
address
to
their
father
,
and
write
with
all
the
solemnity
of
gratitude
which
a
twelvemonth
's
abode
in
the
family
may
have
prompt
.
<EOS>
after
discharge
his
conscience
on
that
head
,
he
proceed
to
inform
them
,
with
many
rapturous
expression
,
of
his
happiness
in
have
obtain
the
affection
of
their
amiable
neighbour
,
Miss
Lucas
,
and
then
explain
that
it
be
merely
with
the
view
of
enjoy
her
society
that
he
have
be
so
ready
to
close
with
their
kind
wish
of
see
him
again
at
Longbourn
<EOS>
,
whither
he
hope
to
be
able
to
return
on
Monday
fortnight
;
for
Lady
Catherine
,
he
add
,
so
heartily
approve
his
marriage
,
that
she
wish
it
to
take
place
as
soon
as
possible
,
which
he
trust
would
be
an
unanswerable
argument
with
his
amiable
Charlotte
to
name
an
early
day
for
make
him
the
happy
of
man
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
's
return
into
Hertfordshire
be
no
longer
a
matter
of
pleasure
to
Mrs.
Bennet
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
she
be
as
much
disposed
to
complain
of
it
as
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
strange
that
he
should
come
to
Longbourn
instead
of
to
Lucas
Lodge
;
it
be
also
very
inconvenient
and
exceedingly
troublesome
.
 
<EOS>
She
hate
have
visitor
in
the
house
while
her
health
be
so
indifferent
,
and
lover
be
of
all
people
the
most
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
gentle
murmur
of
Mrs.
Bennet
,
and
they
give
way
only
to
the
great
distress
of
Mr.
Bingley
's
continue
absence
.
  
<EOS>
neither
Jane
nor
Elizabeth
be
comfortable
on
this
subject
.
<EOS>
day
after
day
pass
away
without
bring
any
other
tiding
of
him
than
the
report
which
shortly
prevail
in
Meryton
of
his
come
no
more
to
Netherfield
the
whole
winter
;
a
report
which
highly
incense
Mrs.
Bennet
,
and
which
she
never
fail
to
contradict
as
a
most
scandalous
falsehood
.
  
<EOS>
even
Elizabeth
begin
to
fear
 
not
that
Bingley
be
indifferent
 
but
that
his
sister
would
be
successful
in
keep
him
away
.
<EOS>
unwilling
as
she
be
to
admit
an
idea
<EOS>
so
destructive
of
Jane
's
happiness
,
and
so
dishonourable
to
the
stability
of
her
lover
,
she
could
not
prevent
its
frequently
recur
.
<EOS>
the
united
effort
of
his
two
unfeele
sister
and
of
his
overpower
friend
,
assist
by
the
attraction
of
Miss
Darcy
and
the
amusement
of
London
,
may
be
too
much
,
she
fear
,
for
the
strength
of
his
attachment
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Jane
,
_
<EOS>
her
_
anxiety
under
this
suspence
be
,
of
course
,
more
painful
than
Elizabeth
's
;
but
whatever
she
feel
she
be
desirous
of
conceal
,
and
between
herself
and
Elizabeth
,
therefore
,
the
subject
be
never
allude
to
.
<EOS>
but
as
no
such
delicacy
restrain
her
mother
,
an
hour
seldom
pass
in
which
she
do
not
talk
of
Bingley
,
express
her
impatience
for
his
arrival
,
or
even
require
Jane
to
confess
that
if
he
do
not
come
back
,
she
should
think
herself
very
ill
use
.
<EOS>
It
need
all
Jane
's
steady
mildness
to
bear
these
attack
with
tolerable
tranquillity
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
return
most
punctually
on
the
Monday
fortnight
,
but
his
reception
at
Longbourn
be
not
quite
so
gracious
as
it
have
be
on
his
first
introduction
.
<EOS>
He
be
too
happy
,
however
,
to
need
much
attention
;
and
luckily
for
the
other
,
the
business
of
love
-
making
relieve
them
from
a
great
deal
of
his
company
.
<EOS>
the
chief
of
every
day
be
spend
by
him
at
Lucas
Lodge
,
and
he
sometimes
return
to
Longbourn
only
in
time
to
make
an
apology
for
his
absence
before
the
family
go
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
be
really
in
a
most
pitiable
state
.
<EOS>
the
very
mention
of
any
thing
concern
the
match
throw
her
into
an
agony
of
ill
humour
,
and
wherever
she
go
she
be
sure
of
hear
it
talk
of
.
<EOS>
the
sight
of
Miss
Lucas
be
odious
to
her
.
<EOS>
as
her
successor
in
that
house
,
she
regard
her
with
jealous
abhorrence
.
<EOS>
whenever
Charlotte
come
to
see
them
<EOS>
she
conclude
her
to
be
anticipate
the
hour
of
possession
;
and
whenever
she
speak
in
a
low
voice
to
Mr.
Collins
,
be
convince
that
they
be
talk
of
the
Longbourn
estate
,
and
resolve
to
turn
herself
and
her
daughter
out
of
the
house
,
as
soon
as
Mr.
Bennet
be
dead
.
<EOS>
She
complain
bitterly
of
all
this
to
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
Mr.
Bennet
,
"
say
she
,
"
it
be
very
hard
to
think
that
Charlotte
Lucas
should
ever
be
mistress
of
this
house
,
that
I
should
be
force
to
make
way
for
_
her
_
,
and
live
to
see
her
take
my
place
in
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My

do
not
give
way
to
such
gloomy
thought

let
us
hope
for
well

let
us
flatter
ourselves
that
_
<EOS>

may
be
the
survivor

"
  
<EOS>
this
be
not
very
consoling
to
Mrs.
Bennet
,
and
,
therefore
,
instead
of
make
any
answer
,
she
go
on
as
before
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
bear
to
think
that
they
should
have
all
this
estate

I
never
can
be
thankful
,
Mr.
Bennet

for
any
thing
about
the
entail

<EOS>
how
any
one
could
have
the
conscience
to
entail
away
an
estate

Miss
Bingley
's
letter
arrive
,
and
put
an
end
to
doubt
.
<EOS>
the
very
first
sentence
convey
the
assurance
of
their
be
all
settle
in
London
for
the
winter
,
and
conclude
with
her
brother
's
regret
at
not
have
have
time
to
pay
his
respect
to
his
friend
in
Hertfordshire
before
he
leave
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
Hope
be
over
,
entirely
over
;
and
when
Jane
could
attend
to
the
rest
of
the
letter
,
she
find
little
,
except
the
professed
affection
of
the
writer
,
that
could
give
her
any
comfort
.
<EOS>
Miss
Darcy
's
praise
occupy
the
chief
of
it
.
<EOS>
Her
many
attraction
be
again
dwell
on
,
and
Caroline
boast
joyfully
of
their
increase
intimacy
,
and
venture
to
predict
the
accomplishment
of
the
wish
which
have
be
unfold
in
her
former
letter
.
<EOS>
She
write
also
with
great
pleasure
of
her
brother
's
be
an
inmate
of
Mr.
Darcy
's
house
,
and
mention
with
rapture
,
some
plan
of
the
latter
with
regard
to
new
furniture
.
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
,
to
whom
Jane
very
soon
communicate
the
chief
of
all
this
,
hear
it
in
silent
indignation
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
be
divide
between
concern
for
her
sister
,
and
resentment
against
all
the
other
.
<EOS>
to
Caroline
's
assertion
of
her
brother
's
be
partial
to
Miss
Darcy
she
pay
no
credit
.
<EOS>
that
he
be
really
fond
of
Jane
,
she
doubt
no
more
than
she
have
ever
do
;
and
much
as
she
have
always
be
dispose
to
like
him
,
she
could
not
think
without
anger
,
hardly
without
contempt
,
on
that
easiness
of
temper
,
that
want
of
proper
resolution
which
now
make
him
the
slave
of
his
design
friend
,
and
lead
him
to
sacrifice
his
own
happiness
to
the
caprice
of
their
inclination
.
<EOS>
have
his
own
happiness
,
however
,
be
the
only
sacrifice
,
he
may
have
be
allow
to
sport
with
it
in
what
ever
manner
he
think
best
;
but
her
sister
's
be
involve
in
it
,
as
she
think
he
must
be
sensible
himself
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
subject
,
in
short
,
on
which
reflection
would
be
long
indulge
,
and
must
be
unavaile
.
<EOS>
She
could
think
of
nothing
else
,
and
yet
whether
Bingley
's
regard
have
really
die
away
,
or
be
suppress
by
his
friend
'
interference
;
whether
he
have
be
aware
of
Jane
's
attachment
,
or
whether
it
have
escape
his
observation
;
whichever
be
the
case
,
though
her
opinion
of
him
must
be
materially
affect
by
the
difference
,
her
sister
's
situation
remain
the
same
,
her
peace
equally
wound
.
  
<EOS>
a
day
or
two
pass
before
Jane
have
courage
to
speak
of
her
feeling
to
Elizabeth
;
but
at
last
on
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
's
leave
them
together
,
after
a
long
irritation
than
usual
about
Netherfield
and
its
master
,
she
could
not
help
say
,
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
that
my
dear
mother
have
more
command
over
herself
;
she
can
have
no
idea
of
the
pain
she
give
me
by
her
continual
reflection
on
him
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
repine
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
last
long
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
forget
,
and
we
shall
all
be
as
we
be
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
look
at
her
sister
with
incredulous
solicitude
,
but
say
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
doubt
me
,
"
cry
Jane
,
slightly
colour
;
"
indeed
you
have
no
reason
.
<EOS>
He
may
live
in
my
memory
as
the
most
amiable
man
of
my
acquaintance
,
but
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
either
to
hope
or
fear
,
and
nothing
to
reproach
him
with
.
<EOS>
thank
God
!
<EOS>
I
have
not
_
<EOS>
that
_
pain
.
<EOS>
a
little
time
therefore
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
certainly
try
to
get
the
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
a
strong
voice
she
soon
add
,
"
I
have
this
comfort
immediately
,
that
it
have
not
be
more
than
an
error
of
fancy
on
my
side

and
that
it
have
do
no
harm
to
any

myself

"
  
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Jane
!
"
exclaim
Elizabeth
,
"
you
be
too
good
.
<EOS>
Your
sweetness
and
disinterestedness
be
really
angelic
;
I
do
not
know
what
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
I
have
never
do
you
justice
,
or
love
you
as
you
deserve
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Bennet
eagerly
disclaim
all
extraordinary
merit
,
and
throw
back
the
praise
on
her
sister
's
warm
affection
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
say
Elizabeth
,
"
this
be
not
fair
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
wish
to
think
all
the
world
respectable
,
and
be
hurt
if
I
speak
ill
of
any
body
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
only
want
to
think
_
<EOS>
you
_
perfect
,
<EOS>
and
you
set
yourself
against
it
.
<EOS>
do
not
be
afraid
of
my
running
into
any
excess
,
of
my
encroach
on
your
privilege
of
universal
good
will
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
.
<EOS>
there
be
few
people
whom
I
really
love
,
and
still
few
of
whom
<EOS>
I
think
well
.
<EOS>
the
more
I
see
of
the
world
,
the
more
am
I
dissatisfied
with
it
;
and
every
day
confirm
my
belief
of
the
inconsistency
of
all
human
character
,
and
of
the
little
dependence
that
can
be
place
on
the
appearance
of
either
merit
or
sense
.
<EOS>
I
have
meet
with
two
instance
lately
;
one
I
will
not
mention
;
the
other
be
Charlotte
's
marriage
.
<EOS>
It
be
unaccountable
!
<EOS>
in
every
view
it
be
unaccountable
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Lizzy
,
do
not
give
way
to
such
feeling
as
these
.
<EOS>
They
will
ruin
your
happiness
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
make
allowance
enough
for
difference
of
situation
and
temper
.
<EOS>
consider
Mr.
Collins
's
respectability
,
and
Charlotte
's
prudent
,
steady
character
.
<EOS>
remember
that
she
be
one
of
a
large
family
;
that
as
to
fortune
,
it
be
a
most
eligible
match
;
and
be
ready
to
believe
,
for
every
body
's
sake
,
that
she
may
feel
something
like
regard
and
esteem
for
our
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
to
oblige
you
,
I
would
try
to
believe
almost
any
thing
,
but
no
one
else
could
be
benefit
by
such
a
belief
as
this
;
for
be
I
persuade
that
Charlotte
have
any
regard
for
him
,
I
should
only
think
bad
of
her
understanding
,
than
I
now
do
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Jane
,
Mr.
Collins
be
a
conceited
,
pompous
,
narrow
-
minded
,
silly
man
;
you
know
he
be
,
as
well
as
I
do
;
and
you
must
feel
,
as
well
as
I
do
,
that
the
woman
who
marry
him
,
can
not
have
a
proper
way
of
thinking
.
<EOS>
You
shall
not
defend
her
,
though
it
be
Charlotte
Lucas
.
<EOS>
You
shall
not
,
for
the
sake
of
one
individual
,
change
the
meaning
of
principle
and
integrity
,
nor
endeavour
to
persuade
yourself
or
me
,
that
selfishness
be
prudence
,
and
insensibility
of
danger
,
security
for
happiness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
think
your
language
too
strong
in
speaking
of
both
,
"
reply
Jane
,
"
and
I
hope
you
will
be
convince
of
it
,
by
see
them
happy
together
.
<EOS>
but
enough
of
this
.
<EOS>
You
allude
to
something
else
.
<EOS>
You
mention
_
two
_
instance
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
misunderstand
you

I
intreat
you

dear
Lizzy
,
not
to
pain
me
by
think
_
that
person
_
to
blame
,
and
say
your
opinion
of
him
be
sink
.
<EOS>
We
must
not
be
so
ready
to
fancy
ourselves
intentionally
injure
.
<EOS>
We
must
not
expect
a
lively
young
man
to
be
always
so
guard
and
circumspect
.
<EOS>
It
be
very
often
nothing
but
our
own
vanity
that
deceive
us

<EOS>
woman
fancy
admiration
mean
more
than
it
do

"
  
<EOS>
"
and
man
take
care
that
they
should
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
designedly
do
,
they
can
not
be
justify
;
but
I
have
no
idea
of
there
be
so
much
design
in
the
world
as
some
person
imagine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
far
from
attribute
any
part
of
Mr.
Bingley
's
conduct
to
design
,
"
say
Elizabeth
;
"
<EOS>
but
without
scheme
to
do
wrong
,
or
to
make
other
unhappy
,
there
may
be
error
,
and
there
may
be
misery
.
<EOS>
Thoughtlessness
,
want
of
attention
to
other
people
's
feeling
,
and
want
of
resolution
,
will
do
the
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
you
impute
it
to
either
of
those
?
<EOS>

"
<EOS>
yes

to
the
last

if
I
go
on
,
I
shall
displease
you

<EOS>
stop
me

you
can

You
persist

then

in
suppose

him

<EOS>

yes

in
conjunction
with
his
friend

<EOS>
"
I
can
not
believe
it

<EOS>
why
should
they
try
to
influence
him
?
<EOS>
They
can
only
wish
his
happiness
,
and
if
he
be
attach
to
me
,
no
other
woman
can
secure
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
first
position
be
false
.
<EOS>
They
may
wish
many
thing
besides
his
happiness
;
they
may
wish
his
increase
of
wealth
and
consequence
;
they
may
wish
him
to
marry
a
girl
who
have
all
the
importance
of
money

great
connection
,
and
pride

<EOS>
"
beyond
a
doubt
,
they
_
do
_
wish
him
to
chuse
Miss
Darcy
,
"
reply
Jane
;
"
but
this
may
be
from
well
feeling
than
you
be
suppose
.
<EOS>
They
have
know
her
much
longer
than
they
have
know
me
;
no
wonder
if
they
love
her
better
.
<EOS>
but
,
whatever
may
be
their
own
wish

,
it
be
very
unlikely

sister
would
think
herself
at
liberty
to
do
it
,

there
be
something
very
objectionable
?

they
believe
him
attach

they
would
not
try

part
us

if
he
be
so

they
could
not
succeed

<EOS>
by
suppose
such
an
affection

you
make
every
body
act
unnaturally
and
wrong

me
most
unhappy

not

me

the
idea

I
be
not
ashamed
of
have
be
mistake

,
at

,
it
be
slight

it
be
nothing
in
comparison
of

I
should
feel
in

ill
of
him

me
take
it
in

good

in
the
light
in
which
it
may

understand

<EOS>
Elizabeth
could
not
oppose
such
a
wish
;
and
from
this
time
Mr.
Bingley
's
name
be
scarcely
ever
mention
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
still
continue
to
wonder
and
repine
at
his
return
no
more
,
and
though
a
day
seldom
pass
in
which
Elizabeth
do
not
account
for
it
clearly
,
there
seem
little
chance
of
her
ever
consider
it
with
less
perplexity
.
<EOS>
Her
daughter
endeavour
to
convince
her
of
what
she
do
not
believe
herself
,
that
his
attention
to
Jane
have
be
merely
the
effect
of
a
common
and
transient
liking
,
which
cease
when
he
see
her
no
more
;
but
though
the
probability
of
the
statement
be
admit
at
the
time

she
have
the

story
to
repeat
every
day

Bennet

good
comfort

,
that
Mr.

must
be
down
again
in

summer

treat
the
matter
differently

one
day

next
to
be
marry

a
girl
like
to
be
cross
in

a
little
now

It
be
something
to
think
of

give
her

sort
of
distinction
among
her
companion

come

on
many

him
often

recommendation

now
add

of

unreserve

whole
of

claim

that
he
have
suffer
from
him

be
now
openly
acknowledge

canvass

pleased

think
how
much
they

always
dislike
Mr.

matter

creature
who
could
suppose
there
may
be
any
extenuate
circumstance
in
the
case

unknown
to
the
society
of
Hertfordshire
;
her
mild
and
steady
candour
always
plead
for
allowance

urge
the
possibility

mistake

by
everybody
else
Mr.

condemn

bad
of

and
scheme
of
felicity

Mr.
Collins

call
from
his
amiable
Charlotte
by
the
arrival
of
Saturday
.
<EOS>
the
pain
of
separation
,
however
,
may
be
alleviate
on
his
side
,
by
preparation
for
the
reception
of
his
bride
,
as
he
have
reason
to
hope
,
that
shortly
after
his
next
return
into
Hertfordshire
,
the
day
would
be
fix
that
be
to
make
him
the
happy
of
man
.
<EOS>
He

leave
of
his
relation
at
Longbourn
with
as
much
solemnity
as
before

wish
his
fair
cousin

,
and
promise

<EOS>
on
the
follow
Monday

Mrs.
Bennet
have
the
pleasure
of
receive
her
brother
and
his
wife
,
who
come
as
usual
to
spend
the
Christmas
at
Longbourn
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gardiner
be
a
sensible
,
gentleman
-
like
man
,
greatly
superior
to
his
sister
,
as
well
by
nature
as
education
.
<EOS>
the
Netherfield
lady
would
have
have
difficulty
in
believe
that
a
man
who
live
by
trade
,
and
within
view
of
his
own
warehouse
,
could
have
be
so
well
breed
and
agreeable
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
who
be
several
year
young
than
Mrs.
Bennet
and
Mrs.
Philips
,
be
an
amiable
,
intelligent
,
elegant
woman
,
and
a
great
favourite
with
all
her
Longbourn
niece
.
<EOS>
between
the
two
eld
and
herself
especially
,
there
subsist
a
very
particular
regard
.
<EOS>
They
have
frequently
be
stay
with
her
in
town
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
part
of
Mrs.
Gardiner
's
business
on
her
arrival
,
be
to
distribute
her
present
and
describe
the
new
fashion
.
<EOS>
when
this
be
do
,
she
have
a
less
active
part
to
play
.
<EOS>
It
become
her
turn
to
listen
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
have
many
grievance
to
relate
,
and
much
to
complain
of
.
<EOS>
They
have
all
be
very
ill
-
use
since
she
last
see
her
sister
.
<EOS>
two
of
her
girl
have
be
on
the
point
of
marriage
,
and
after
all
there
be
nothing
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
blame
Jane
,
"
she
continue
,
"
for
Jane
would
have
get
Mr.
Bingley
,
if
she
could
.
<EOS>
but
,
Lizzy
!
<EOS>
oh
,
sister
!
<EOS>
it
be
very
hard
to
think
that
she
may
have
be
Mr.
Collins
's
wife
by
this
time
,
have
not
it
be
for
her
own
perverseness
.
<EOS>
He
make
her
an
offer
in
this
very
room
,
and
she
refuse
him
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
of
it
be
,
that
Lady
Lucas
will
have
a
daughter
marry
before
I
have
,
and
that
Longbourn
estate
be
just
as
much
entail
as
ever
.
<EOS>
the
Lucases
be
very
artful
people
indeed
,
sister
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
for
what
they
can
get
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
say
it
of
them
,
but
so
it
be
.
<EOS>
It
make
me
very
nervous
and
poorly
,
to
be
thwart
so
in
my
own
family
,
and
to
have
neighbour
who
think
of
themselves
before
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
however
,
your
come
just
at
this
time
be
the
great
of
comfort
,
and
I
be
very
glad
to
hear
what
you
tell
us
,
of
long
sleeve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
to
whom
the
chief
of
this
news
have
be
give
before
,
in
the
course
of
Jane
and
Elizabeth
's
correspondence
with
her
,
make
her
sister
a
slight
answer
,
and
in
compassion
to
her
niece
turn
the
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
when
alone
with
Elizabeth
afterwards
,
she
speak
more
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
It
seem
likely
to
have
be
a
desirable
match
for
Jane
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
it
go
off
.
<EOS>
but
these
thing
happen
so
often
!
<EOS>
a
young
man
,
such
as
you
describe
Mr.
Bingley
,
so
easily
fall
in
love
with
a
pretty
girl
for
a
few
week
,
and
when
accident
separate
them
,
so
easily
forget
her
,
that
these
sort
of
inconstancy
be
very
frequent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
an
excellent
consolation
in
its
way
,
"
say
Elizabeth
,
"
but
it
will
not
do
for
_
us
_
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
suffer
by
_
accident
_
.
<EOS>
It
do
not
often
happen
that
the
interference
of
friend
will
persuade
a
young
man
of
independent
fortune
to
think
no
more
of
a
girl
,
whom
he
be
violently
in
love
with
only
a
few
day
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
but
that
expression
of
"
violently
in
love
"
be
so
hackneye
,
so
doubtful
,
so
indefinite
,
that
it
give
me
very
little
idea
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
often
apply
to
feeling
which
arise
from
an
half
-
hour
's
acquaintance
,
as
to
a
real
,
strong
attachment
.
<EOS>
pray
,
how
_
violent
be
_
Mr.
Bingley
's
love
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
see
a
more
promising
inclination
.
<EOS>
He
be
grow
quite
inattentive
to
other
people
,
and
wholly
engross
by
her
.
<EOS>
every
time
they
meet
,
it
be
more
decided
and
remarkable
.
<EOS>
at
his
own
ball
he
offend
two
or
three
young
lady
,
by
not
ask
them
to
dance
,
and
I
speak
to
him
twice
myself
,
without
receive
an
answer
.
<EOS>
Could
there
be
fine
symptom
?
<EOS>
be
not
general
incivility
the
very
essence
of
love
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
!
 
<EOS>
of
that
kind
of
love
which
I
suppose
him
to
have
feel
.
<EOS>
Poor
Jane
!
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
for
her
,
because
,
with
her
disposition
,
she
may
not
get
over
it
immediately
.
<EOS>
It
have
better
have
happen
to
_
<EOS>
you
_
<EOS>
,
Lizzy
;
you
would
have
laugh
yourself
out
of
it
sooner
.
<EOS>
but
do
you
think
she
would
be
prevail
on
to
go
back
with
us
?
<EOS>
change
of
scene
may
be
of
service
 
and
perhaps
a
little
relief
from
home
,
may
be
as
useful
as
anything
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
exceedingly
pleased
with
this
proposal
,
and
feel
persuade
of
her
sister
's
ready
acquiescence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
add
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
"
that
no
consideration
with
regard
to
this
young
man
will
influence
her
.
<EOS>
We
live
in
so
different
a
part
of
town
,
all
our
connection
be
so
different
,
and
,
as
you
well
know
,
we
go
out
so
little
,
that
it
be
very
improbable
<EOS>
they
should
meet
at
all
,
unless
he
really
come
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
_
that
_
be
quite
impossible
;
for
he
be
now
in
the
custody
of
his
friend
,
and
Mr.
Darcy
would
no
more
suffer
him
to
call
on
Jane
in
such
a
part
of
London
!
<EOS>
My
dear
aunt
,
how
could
you
think
of
it
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
may
perhaps
have
_
hear
_
of
such
a
place
as
Gracechurch
Street
,
but
he
would
hardly
think
a
month
's
ablution
enough
to
cleanse
him
from
its
impurity
,
be
he
once
to
enter
it
;
and
depend
upon
it
,
Mr.
Bingley
never
stir
without
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
much
the
well
.
<EOS>
I
hope
they
will
not
meet
at
all
.
<EOS>
but
do
not
Jane
correspond
with
the
sister
?
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
will
not
be
able
to
help
call
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
drop
the
acquaintance
entirely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
in
spite
of
the
certainty
in
which
Elizabeth
affect
to
place
this
point
,
as
well
as
the
still
more
interesting
one
of
Bingley
's
be
withhold
from
see
Jane
<EOS>
,
she
feel
a
solicitude
on
the
subject
which
convince
her
,
on
examination
,
that
she
do
not
consider
it
entirely
hopeless
.
<EOS>
It
be
possible
,
and
sometimes
she
think
it
probable
,
that
his
affection
may
be
re
-
animate
,
and
the
influence
of
his
friend
successfully
combat
by
the
more
natural
influence
of
Jane
's
attraction
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Bennet
accept
her
aunt
's
invitation
with
pleasure
;
and
the
bingley
be
no
otherwise
in
her
thought
at
the
time
,
than
as
she
hope
that
,
by
Caroline
's
not
live
in
the
same
house
with
her
brother
,
she
may
occasionally
spend
a
morning
with
her
,
without
any
danger
of
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
Gardiners
staid
a
week
at
Longbourn
;
and
what
with
the
Philipses
,
the
Lucases
,
and
the
officer
,
there
be
not
a
day
without
its
engagement
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
have
so
carefully
provide
for
the
entertainment
of
her
brother
and
sister
,
that
they
do
not
once
sit
down
to
a
family
dinner
.
<EOS>
when
the
engagement
be
for
home
,
some
of
the
officer
always
make
part
of
it
,
of
which
officer
Mr.
Wickham
be
sure
to
be
one
;
and
on
these
occasion
,
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
render
suspicious
by
Elizabeth
's
warm
commendation
of
him
,
narrowly
observe
them
both
.
<EOS>
without
suppose
them
,
from
what
she
see
,
to
be
very
seriously
in
love
,
their
preference
of
each
other
be
plain
enough
to
make
her
a
little
uneasy
;
and
she
resolve
to
speak
to
Elizabeth
on
the
subject
before
she
leave
Hertfordshire
,
and
represent
to
her
the
imprudence
of
encourage
such
an
attachment
.
  
<EOS>
to
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
Wickham
have
one
mean
of
afford
pleasure
,
unconnected
with
his
general
power
.
<EOS>
about
ten
or
a
dozen
year
ago
,
before
her
marriage
,
she
have
spend
a
considerable
time
in
that
very
part
of
Derbyshire
,
to
which
he
belong
.
<EOS>
They
have
,
therefore
,
many
acquaintance
in
common
;
and
,
though
Wickham
have
be
little
there
since
the
death
of
Darcy
's
father
,
five
year
before
,
it
be
yet
in
his
power
to
give
her
fresher
intelligence
of
her
former
friend
,
than
she
have
be
in
the
way
of
procure
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Gardiner
have
see
Pemberley
,
and
know
the
late
Mr.
Darcy
by
character
perfectly
well
.
<EOS>
here
consequently
be
an
inexhaustible
subject
of
discourse
.
<EOS>
in
compare
her
recollection
of
Pemberley
,
with
the
minute
description
which
Wickham
could
give
,
and
in
bestow
her
tribute
of
praise
on
the
character
of
its
late
possessor
,
she
be
delight
both
him
and
herself
.
<EOS>
on
be
make
acquainted
with
the
present
Mr.
Darcy
's
treatment
of
him
,
she
try
to
remember
something
of
that
gentleman
's
reputed
disposition
when
quite
a
lad
,
which
may
agree
with
it
,
and
be
confident
at
last
,
that
she
recollect
have
hear
Mr.
Fitzwilliam
Darcy
formerly
speak
of
as
a
very
proud
,
ill
-
natured
boy
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs.
Gardiner
's
caution
to
Elizabeth
be
punctually
and
kindly
give
on
the
first
favourable
opportunity
of
speak
to
her
alone
;
after
honestly
tell
her
what
she
think
,
she
thus
go
on
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
too
sensible
a
girl
,
<EOS>
Lizzy
,
to
fall
in
love
merely
because
you
be
warn
against
it
;
and
,
therefore
,
I
be
not
afraid
of
speak
openly
.
<EOS>
seriously
,
I
would
have
you
be
on
your
guard
.
<EOS>
do
not
involve
yourself
,
or
endeavour
to
involve
him
in
an
affection
which
the
want
of
fortune
would
make
so
very
imprudent
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
say
against
_
him
_
;
he
be
a
most
interesting
young
man
;
and
if
he
have
the
fortune
he
ought
to
have
,
I
should
think
you
could
not
do
better
.
<EOS>
but
as
it
be
 
you
must
not
let
your
fancy
run
away
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
sense
,
and
we
all
expect
you
to
use
it
.
<EOS>
Your
father
would
depend
on
_
your
_
resolution
and
good
conduct
,
I
be
sure
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
disappoint
your
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
aunt
,
this
be
be
serious
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
and
I
hope
to
engage
you
to
be
serious
likewise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
you
need
not
be
under
any
alarm
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
care
of
myself
,
and
of
Mr.
Wickham
too
.
<EOS>
He
shall
not
be
in
love
with
me
,
if
I
can
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Elizabeth
,
you
be
not
serious
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
I
will
try
again
.
<EOS>
at
present
I
be
not
in
love
with
Mr.
Wickham
;
no
,
I
certainly
be
not
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
,
beyond
all
comparison
,
the
most
agreeable
man
I
ever
see
 
<EOS>
and
if
he
become
really
attach
to
me
 
<EOS>
I
believe
it
will
be
well
that
he
should
not
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
imprudence
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
that
_
abominable
Mr.
Darcy
!
 
<EOS>
My
father
's
opinion
of
me
do
me
the
great
honour
;
and
I
should
be
miserable
to
forfeit
it
.
<EOS>
My
father
,
however
,
be
partial
to
Mr.
Wickham
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
my
dear
aunt
,
I
should
be
very
sorry
to
be
the
mean
of
make
any
of
you
unhappy
;
but
since
we
see
every
day
that
where
there
be
affection
,
young
people
be
seldom
withhold
by
immediate
want
of
fortune
,
from
enter
into
engagement
with
each
other
,
how
can
I
promise
to
be
wise
than
so
many
of
my
fellow
creature
if
I
be
tempt
,
or
how
be
I
even
to
know
that
it
would
be
wisdom
to
resist
?
<EOS>
all
that
I
can
promise
you
,
therefore
,
be
not
to
be
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
believe
myself
his
first
object
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
in
company
with
him
,
I
will
not
be
wish
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
I
will
do
my
good
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
will
be
as
well
,
if
you
discourage
his
come
here
so
very
often
.
<EOS>
at
least
,
you
should
not
_
remind
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
your
Mother
of
invite
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
as
I
do
the
other
day
,
"
say
Elizabeth
,
with
a
conscious
smile
;
"
very
true
,
it
will
be
wise
in
me
to
refrain
from
_
that
_
.
<EOS>
but
do
not
imagine
that
he
be
always
here
so
often
.
<EOS>
It
be
on
your
account
that
he
have
be
so
frequently
invite
this
week

<EOS>
You
know
my
mother
's
idea
as
to
the
necessity
of
constant
company
for
her
friend

but
really
,
and
upon

Elizabeth
have
thank
her
for
the
kindness
of
her
hint

wonderful
instance

advice

Mr.
Collins
return
into
Hertfordshire
soon
after
it
have
be

the
Gardiners

as
he

his

no
great
inconvenience

Mrs.
Bennet

<EOS>
His

at
length
so
far

Thursday
be
to
be
the
wedding
day

and
on
Wednesday
Miss
Lucas
pay
her
farewell
visit
;
and
when
she
rise
to
take
leave
,
Elizabeth
,
ashamed
of
her
mother
's
ungracious
and
reluctant
good
wish
,
and
sincerely
affect
herself
,
accompany
her
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
as
they
go
down
stair
together
,
Charlotte

,
  
"
I
shall
depend
on
hearing
from
you
very
often

have
another

Will
you
come

<EOS>

We
shall
often

I

to
leave
Kent
for
some

promise
me
,
therefore
,
to
come
to
Hunsford
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
could
not
refuse
,
though
she
foresee
little
pleasure
in
the
visit
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
and
Maria
be
to
come
to
me
in
March

"
add
Charlotte
,
"
and
I
hope
you
will
consent
to
be
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
Eliza
,
you
will
be
as
welcome
to
me
as
either
of
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
wedding
take
place
;
the
bride
and
bridegroom
set
off
for
Kent
from
the
church
door
,
and
every
body
have
as
much
to
say
or
to
hear
on
the
subject
as
usual
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
soon
hear
from
her
friend
;
and
their
correspondence
be
as
regular
and
frequent
as
it
have
ever
be
;
that
it
should
be
equally
unreserved
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
could
never
address
her
without
feel
that
all
the
comfort
of
intimacy
be
over
,
and
,
though
determine
not
to
slacken
as
a
correspondent
,
it
be
for
the
sake
of
what
have
be
,
rather
than
what
be
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
's
first
letter
be
receive
with
a
good
deal
of
eagerness
;
there
could
not
but
be
curiosity
to
know
how
she
would
speak
of
her
new
home
,
how
she
would
like
Lady
Catherine
,
and
how
happy
she
would
dare
pronounce
herself
to
be
;
though
,
when
the
letter
be
read
,
Elizabeth
feel
that
Charlotte
express
herself
on
every
point
exactly
as
she
may
have
foresee
.
<EOS>
She
write
cheerfully
,
seem
surround
with
comfort
,
and
mention
nothing
which
she
could
not
praise
.
<EOS>
the
house
,
furniture
,
neighbourhood
,
and
road
,
be
all
to
her
taste
,
and
Lady
Catherine
's
behaviour
be
most
friendly
and
obliging
.
<EOS>
It
be
Mr.
Collins
's
picture
of
Hunsford
and
Rosings
rationally
soften
;
and
Elizabeth
perceive
that
she
must
wait
for
her
own
visit
there
,
to
know
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
Jane
have
already
write
a
few
line
to
her
sister
to
announce
their
safe
arrival
in
London
;
and
when
she
write
again
,
Elizabeth
hope
it
would
be
in
her
power
to
say
something
of
the
Bingleys
.
  
<EOS>
Her
impatience
for
this
second
letter
be
as
well
reward
as
impatience
generally
be
.
<EOS>
Jane
have
be
a
week
in
town
,
without
either
see
or
hear
from
Caroline
.
<EOS>
She
account
for
it
,
however
,
by
suppose
that
her
last
letter
to
her
friend
from
Longbourn
,
have
by
some
accident
be
lose
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
aunt
,
"
she
continue
,
"
be
go
to
-
morrow
into
that
part
of
the
town
,
and
I
shall
take
the
opportunity
of
call
in
Grosvenor
-
street
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
write
again
when
the
visit
be
pay
,
and
she
have
see
Miss
Bingley
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
Caroline
in
spirit
,
"
be
her
word
,
"
but
she
be
very
glad
to
see
me
,
and
reproach
me
for
give
her
no
notice
of
my
come
to
London
.
<EOS>
I
be
right
,
therefore
;
my
last
letter
have
never
reach
her
.
<EOS>
I
enquire
after
their
brother
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
He
be
well
,
but
so
much
engage
with
Mr.
Darcy
,
that
they
scarcely
ever
see
him
.
<EOS>
I
find
that
Miss
Darcy
be
expect
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
see
her
.
<EOS>
My
visit
be
not
long
,
as
Caroline
and
Mrs.
Hurst
be
go
out
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
I
shall
soon
see
them
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
shake
her
head
over
this
letter
.
<EOS>
It
convince
her
,
that
accident
only
could
discover
to
Mr.
Bingley
her
sister
's
be
in
town
.
  
<EOS>
four
week
pass
away
,
and
Jane
see
nothing
of
him
.
<EOS>
She
endeavour
to
persuade
herself
that
she
do
not
regret
it
;
but
she
could
no
longer
be
blind
to
Miss
Bingley
's
inattention
.
<EOS>
after
wait
at
home
every
morning
for
a
fortnight
,
and
invent
every
evening
a
fresh
excuse
for
her
,
the
visitor
do
at
last
appear
;
but
the
shortness
of
her
stay
,
and
yet
more
,
the
alteration
of
her
manner
,
would
allow
Jane
to
deceive
herself
no
longer
.
<EOS>
the
letter
which
she
write
on
this
occasion
to
her
sister
,
will
prove
what
she
feel
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Lizzy
will
,
I
be
sure
,
be
incapable
of
triumph
in
her
well
judgment
,
at
my
expence
,
when
I
confess
myself
to
have
be
entirely
deceive
in
Miss
Bingley
's
regard
for
me
.
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
sister
,
though
the
event
have
prove
you
right
,
do
not
think
me
obstinate
if
I
still
assert
,
that
,
consider
what
her
behaviour
be
,
my
confidence
be
as
natural
as
your
suspicion
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
at
all
comprehend
her
reason
for
wish
to
be
intimate
with
me
,
but
if
the
same
circumstance
be
to
happen
again
,
I
be
sure
I
should
be
deceive
again
.
<EOS>
Caroline
do
not
return
my
visit
till
yesterday
;
and
not
a
note
,
not
a
line
,
do
I
receive
in
the
mean
time
.
<EOS>
when
she
do
come
,
it
be
very
evident
that
she
have
no
pleasure
in
it
;
she
make
a
slight
,
formal
,
apology
,
for
not
call
before
,
say
not
a
word
of
wish
to
see
me
again
,
and
be
in
every
respect
<EOS>
so
alter
a
creature
,
that
when
she
go
away
,
I
be
perfectly
resolve
to
continue
the
acquaintance
no
longer
.
<EOS>
I
pity
,
though
I
can
not
help
blame
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
wrong
in
single
me
out
as
she
do
;
I
can
safely
say
,
that
every
advance
to
intimacy
begin
on
her
side
.
<EOS>
but
I
pity
her
,
because
she
must
feel
that
she
have
be
act
wrong
,
and
because
I
be
very
sure
that
anxiety
for
her
brother
be
the
cause
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
explain
myself
farther
;
and
though
_
<EOS>
we
_
know
this
anxiety
to
be
quite
needless
,
yet
if
she
feel
it
,
it
will
easily
account
for
her
behaviour
to
me
;
and
so
deservedly
dear
as
he
be
to
his
sister
<EOS>
,
whatever
anxiety
she
may
feel
on
his
behalf
,
be
natural
and
amiable
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
but
wonder
,
however
,
at
her
have
any
such
fear
now
,
because
,
if
he
have
at
all
care
about
me
,
we
must
have
meet
long
,
long
ago
.
<EOS>
He
know
of
my
being
in
town
,
I
be
certain
,
from
something
she
say
herself
;
and
yet
it
should
seem
by
her
manner
of
talking
,
as
if
she
want
to
persuade
herself
that
he
be
really
partial
to
Miss
Darcy
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
understand
it
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
not
afraid
of
judge
harshly
,
I
should
be
almost
tempt
to
say
,
that
there
be
a
strong
appearance
of
duplicity
in
all
this
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
endeavour
to
banish
every
painful
thought
,
and
think
only
of
what
will
make
me
happy
,
your
affection
,
and
the
invariable
kindness
of
my
dear
uncle
and
aunt
.
<EOS>
let
me
hear
from
you
very
soon
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bingley
say
something
of
his
never
return
to
Netherfield
again
,
of
give
up
the
house
,
but
not
with
any
certainty
.
<EOS>
We
have
well
not
mention
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
extremely
glad
that
you
have
such
pleasant
account
from
our
friend
at
Hunsford
.
<EOS>
pray
go
to
see
them
,
with
Sir
William
and
Maria

<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
will
be
very
comfortable
there

Your
's
,
&
c.
"
  
this
letter
give
Elizabeth
some
pain
;
but
her
spirit
return
as
she
consider
that
Jane
would
no
longer
be
dupe
,
by
the
sister
at
least
.
<EOS>
all
expectation
from
the
brother
be
now
absolutely
over
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
even
wish
for
any
renewal
of
his
attention
.
<EOS>
His
character
sink
on
every
review
of
it
;
and
as
a
punishment
for
him
,
as
well
as
a
possible
advantage
to
Jane
,
she
seriously
hope
he
may
really
soon
marry
Mr.
Darcy
's
sister
,
as
,
by
Wickham
's
account
,
she
would
make
him
abundantly
regret
what
he
have
throw
away
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Gardiner
about
this
time
remind
Elizabeth
of
her
promise
concern
that
gentleman
,
and
require
information
;
and
Elizabeth
have
such
to
send
as
may
rather
give
contentment
to
her
aunt
than
to
herself
.
<EOS>
His
apparent
partiality
have
subside
,
his
attention
be
over
,
he
be
the
admirer
of
some
one
else
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
watchful
enough
to
see
it
all
,
but
she
could
see
it
and
write
of
it
without
material
pain
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
have
be
but
slightly
touch
,
and
her
vanity
be
satisfied
with
believe
that
_
she
_
would
have
be
his
only
choice
,
have
fortune
permit
it
.
<EOS>
the
sudden
acquisition
of
ten
thousand
pound
be
the
most
remarkable
charm
of
the
young
lady
,
to
whom
he
be
now
render
himself
agreeable
;
but
Elizabeth
,
less
clear
-
sighted
perhaps
in
his
case
than
in
Charlotte
's
,
do
not
quarrel
with
him
for
his
wish
of
independence
.
<EOS>
nothing
,
on
the
contrary
,
could
be
more
natural
;
and
while
able
to
suppose
that
it
cost
him
a
few
struggle
to
relinquish
her
,
she
be
ready
to
allow
it
a
wise
and
desirable
measure
for
both
,
and
could
very
sincerely
wish
him
happy
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
be
acknowledge
to
Mrs.
Gardiner
;
and
after
relate
the
circumstance
,
she
thus
go
on
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
now
convinced
,
my
dear
aunt
,
that
I
have
never
be
much
in
love
;
for
have
I
really
experience
that
pure
and
elevate
passion
,
I
should
at
present
det
his
very
name
,
and
wish
him
all
manner
of
evil
.
<EOS>
but
my
feeling
be
not
only
cordial
towards
_
him
_
;
they
be
even
impartial
towards
Miss
King
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
find
out
that
I
hate
her
at
all
,
or
that
I
be
in
the
least
unwilling
to
think
her
a
very
good
sort
of
girl
.
<EOS>
there
can
be
no
love
in
all
this
.
<EOS>
My
watchfulness
have
be
effectual
;
and
though
I
should
certainly
be
a
more
interesting
object
to
all
my
acquaintance
,
be
I
distractedly
in
love
with
him
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
say
that
I
regret
my
comparative
insignificance
.
<EOS>
importance
may
sometimes
be
purchase
too
dearly
.
<EOS>
Kitty
and
Lydia
take
his
defection
much
more
to
heart
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
They
be
young
in
the
way
of
the
world
,
and
not
yet
open
to
the
mortifying
conviction
that
handsome
young
man
must
have
something
to
live
on
,
as
well
as
the
plain
.
"
    
<EOS>
with
no
great
event
than
these
in
the
Longbourn
family
,
and
otherwise
diversify
by
little
beyond
the
walk
to
Meryton
,
sometimes
dirty
and
sometimes
cold
,
do
January
and
February
pass
away
.
<EOS>
March
be
to
take
Elizabeth
to
Hunsford
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
at
first
thought
very
seriously
of
go
thither
;
but
Charlotte
,
she
soon
find
,
be
depend
on
the
plan
,
and
she
gradually
learn
to
consider
it
herself
with
great
pleasure
as
well
as
great
certainty
.
<EOS>
absence
have
increase
her
desire
of
see
Charlotte
again
,
and
weaken
her
disgust
of
Mr.
Collins
.
<EOS>
there
be
novelty
in
the
scheme
,
and
as
,
with
such
a
mother
and
such
uncompanionable
sister
,
home
could
not
be
faultless
,
a
little
change
be
not
unwelcome
for
its
own
sake
.
<EOS>
the
journey
would
moreover
give
her
a
peep
at
Jane
;
and
,
in
short
,
as
the
time
draw
near
,
she
would
have
be
very
sorry
for
any
delay
.
<EOS>
every
thing
,
however
,
go
on
smoothly
,
and
be
finally
settle
accord
to
Charlotte
's
first
sketch
.
<EOS>
She
be
to
accompany
Sir
William
and
his
second
daughter
.
<EOS>
the
improvement
of
spend
a
night
in
London
be
add
in
time
,
and
the
plan
become
perfect
as
plan
could
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
pain
be
in
leave
her
father
,
who
would
certainly
miss
her
,
and
who
,
when
it
come
to
the
point
,
so
little
like
her
going
,
that
he
tell
her
to
write
to
him
,
and
almost
promise
to
answer
her
letter
.
  
<EOS>
the
farewell
between
herself
and
Mr.
Wickham
be
perfectly
friendly
;
on
his
side
even
more
.
<EOS>
His
present
pursuit
could
not
make
him
forget
that
Elizabeth
have
be
the
first
to
excite
and
to
deserve
his
attention
,
the
first
to
listen
and
to
pity
,
the
first
to
be
admire
;
and
in
his
manner
of
bid
her
adieu
,
wish
her
every
enjoyment
,
remind
her
of
what
she
be
to
expect
in
Lady
Catherine
de
Bourgh
,
and
trust
their
opinion
of
her
 
their
opinion
of
every
body
 
would
always
coincide
,
there
be
a
solicitude
,
an
interest
which
she
feel
must
ever
attach
her
to

Sir

<EOS>
It

twenty

four

<EOS>
on
the
stair
be
a
troop

whose
eagerness

their

appearance
would
not
allow

when

lane

in

of

Parsonage

turning

thing

they

arrive

<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
and
Charlotte
appear
at
the
door
,
and
the
carriage
stop
at
the
small
gate
,
which
lead
by
a
short
gravel
walk
to
the
house
,
amidst
the
nod
and
smile
of
the
whole
party
.
<EOS>
in
a
moment
they
be
all
out
of
the
chaise
,
rejoice
at
the
sight
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Collins
welcome
her
friend
with
the
lively
pleasure
,
and
Elizabeth
be
more
and
more
satisfied
with
come
,
when
she
find
herself
so
affectionately
receive
.
<EOS>
She
see
instantly
that
her
cousin
's
manner
be
not
alter
by
his
marriage
;
his
formal
civility
be
just
what
it
have
be
,
and
he
detain
her
some
minute
at
the
gate
to
hear
and
satisfy
his
enquiry
after
all
her
family
.
<EOS>
They
be
then
,
with
no
other
delay
than
his
pointing
out
the
neatness
of
the
entrance
,
take
into
the
house
;
and
as
soon
as
they
be
in
the
parlour
,
he
welcome
them
a
second
time
with
ostentatious
formality
to
his
humble
abode
,
and
punctually
repeat
all
his
wife
's
offer
of
refreshment
.
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
prepared
to
see
him
in
his
glory
;
and
she
could
not
help
fancy
that
in
display
the
good
proportion
of
the
room
,
its
aspect
and
its
furniture
,
he
address
himself
particularly
to
her
,
as
if
wish
to
make
her
feel
what
she
have
lose
in
refuse
him
.
<EOS>
but
though
every
thing
seem
neat
and
comfortable
,
she
be
not
able
to
gratify
him
by
any
sigh
of
repentance
;
and
rather
look
with
wonder
at
her
friend
that
she
could
have
<EOS>
so
cheerful
an
air
,
with
such
a
companion
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Collins
say
any
thing
of
which
his
wife
may
reasonably
be
ashamed
,
which
certainly
be
not
unseldom
,
she
involuntarily
turn
her
eye
on
Charlotte
.
<EOS>
once
or
twice
she
could
discern
a
faint
blush
;
but
in
general
Charlotte
wisely
do
not
hear
.
<EOS>
after
sit
long
enough
to
admire
every
article
of
furniture
in
the
room
,
from
the
sideboard
to
the
fender
,
to
give
an
account
of
their
journey
and
of
all
that
have
happen
in
London
,
Mr.
Collins
invite
them
to
take
a
stroll
in
the
garden
,
which
be
large
and
well
lay
out
,
and
to
the
cultivation
of
which
he
attend
himself
.
<EOS>
to
work
in
his
garden
be
one
of
his
most
respectable
pleasure
;
and
Elizabeth
admire
the
command
of
countenance
with
which
Charlotte
talk
of
the
healthfulness
of
the
exercise
,
and
own
she
encourage
it
as
much
as
possible
.
<EOS>
here
,
lead
the
way
through
every
walk
and
cross
walk
,
and
scarcely
allow
them
an
interval
to
utter
the
praise
he
ask
for
,
every
view
be
point
out
with
a
minuteness
which
leave
beauty
entirely
behind
.
<EOS>
He
could
number
the
field
in
every
direction
,
and
could
tell
how
many
tree
there
be
in
the
most
distant
clump
.
<EOS>
but
of
all
the
view
which
his
garden
,
or
which
the
country
,
or
the
kingdom
could
boast
,
none
be
to
be
compare
with
the
prospect
of
Rosings
,
afford
by
an
opening
in
the
tree
that
border
the
park
nearly
opposite
the
front
of
his
house
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
handsome
modern
building
,
well
situate
on
rise
ground
.
  
<EOS>
from
his
garden
,
Mr.
Collins
would
have
lead
them
round
his
two
meadow
,
but
the
lady
not
have
shoe
to
encounter
the
remain
of
a
white
frost
,
turn
back
;
and
while
Sir
William
accompany
him
,
Charlotte
take
her
sister
and
friend
over
the
house
,
extremely
well
pleased
,
probably
,
to
have
the
opportunity
of
shew
it
without
her
husband
's
help
.
<EOS>
It
be
rather
small
,
but
well
build
and
convenient
;
and
every
thing
be
fit
up
and
arrange
with
a
neatness
and
consistency
of
which
Elizabeth
give
Charlotte
all
the
credit
.
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Collins
could
be
forget
,
there
be
really
a
great
air
of
comfort
throughout
,
and
by
Charlotte
's
evident
enjoyment
of
it
,
Elizabeth
suppose
he
must
be
often
forget
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
already
learn
that
Lady
Catherine
be
still
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
It
be
speak
of
again
while
they
be
at
dinner
,
when
Mr.
Collins
join
in
,
observe
,
  
"
<EOS>

will
have
the
honour
of

the
ensue
Sunday

I
need
not
say
you
will
be
delighted
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
all
affability
and
condescension

and
I
doubt
not
<EOS>
but
you
will
be
honour
with
some
portion
of
her
notice
when
service
be
over

<EOS>
I
have
scarcely
any
hesitation
in
say
that
she
will
include
you
and
my
sister
Maria
in
every
invitation
with
which
she
honour
us
during
your
stay
here
.
<EOS>
Her
behaviour
to
my
dear
Charlotte

We
dine
at
rosing
twice
every
week

to
walk
home

Her
ladyship

carriage

regularly
order
for

one
of

for
she
have
several

Lady
Catherine

sensible
woman
indeed

and
a
most
attentive
neighbour

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
true
,
my
dear

that
be
exactly
what
I
say

the
sort
of
woman
whom
one
can
not
regard
with
too
much
deference
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
evening
be
spend
chiefly
in
talk
over
Hertfordshire
news
,
and
tell
again
what
have
be
already
write
;
and
when
it
close
,
Elizabeth
in
the
solitude
of
her
chamber
have
to
meditate
upon
Charlotte
's
degree
of
contentment
,
to
understand
her
address
in
guiding
,
and
composure
in
bear
with
her
husband
,
and
to
acknowledge
that
it
be
all
do
very
well
.
<EOS>
She
have
also
to
anticipate
how
her
visit
would
pass
,
the
quiet
tenor
of
their
usual
employment
,
the
vexatious
interruption
of
Mr.
Collins
,
and
the
gaiety
of
their
intercourse
with
Rosings
.
<EOS>
a
lively
imagination
soon
settle
it
all
.
  
<EOS>
about
the
middle
of
the
next
day
,
as
she
be
in
her
room
get
ready
for
a
walk
,
a
sudden
noise
below
seem
to
speak
the
whole
house
in
confusion
;
and
after
listen
a
moment
,
she
hear
somebody
run
up
stair
in
a
violent
hurry
,
and
call
loudly
after
her
.
<EOS>
She
open
the
door
,
and
meet
Maria
in
the
landing
place
,
who
,
breathless
with
agitation
,
cry
out
,
  
"
<EOS>

haste

<EOS>
Elizabeth
ask
question
in

Maria
would
tell
her
nothing
more
,
and
down
they
run
into
the
dining
-
room
,
which
front
the
lane

in
quest
of
this
wonder
;
it
be
two
lady

in
a
low
phaeton
at
the
garden
gate

<EOS>
"
and
be
this
all
?

cry
Elizabeth

<EOS>
"
I
expect
at
least
that
the
pig
be
get
into
the
garden
,
and
here
be
nothing
but
Lady
Catherine
and
her
daughter

"
La
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
"
say
Maria
quite
shock
at
the
mistake

"
it
be
not
Lady
Catherine

<EOS>
the
old
lady
be
Mrs.
Jenkinson

who
live
with
them

<EOS>
the
other
be
Miss
De
Bourgh

<EOS>
only
look
at
her

<EOS>
She
be
quite
a
little
creature
.
<EOS>
who
would
have
think
she
could
be
so
thin
and
small
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
abominably
rude
to
keep
Charlotte
out
of
door
in
all
this
wind

<EOS>
why
do
she
not
come
in
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Charlotte
say
,
she
hardly

It
be
the
great
of
favour

come
in

<EOS>
"
I
like
her
appearance
,

say
Elizabeth

strike
with
other
idea

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
look
sickly
and
cross
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
she
will
do
for
him
very
well

<EOS>
She
will
make
him
a

<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
and
Charlotte
be
both
stand
at
the
gate
in
conversation
with
the
lady

and
Sir
William

to
Elizabeth
's
high
diversion
,
be
station
in
the
doorway
,
in
earnest
contemplation
of
the
greatness
before
him
,
and
constantly
bow
whenever
Miss
De
Bourgh
look
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
there
be
nothing
more
to
be
say
;
the
lady
drive
on
,
and
the
other
return
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
no
sooner
see
the
two
girl
than
he
begin
to
congratulate
them
on
their
good
fortune
,
which
Charlotte
explain
by
let
them
know
that
the
whole
party
be
ask
to
dine
at
Rosings
the
next
day

<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
's
triumph
in
consequence
of
this
invitation
be
complete
.
<EOS>
the
power
of
display
the
grandeur
of
his
patroness
to
his
wonder
visitor
,
and
of
let
them
see
her
civility
towards
himself
and
his
wife
,
be
exactly
what
he
have
wish
for
;
and
that
an
opportunity
of
do
it
should
be
give
so
soon
,
be
such
an
instance
of
Lady
Catherine
's
condescension
as
he
know
not
how
to
admire
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
confess
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
I
should
not
have
be
at
all
surprise
by
her
Ladyship
's
ask
us
on
Sunday
to
drink
tea
and
spend
the
evening
at
Rosings
.
<EOS>
I
rather
expect
,
from
my
knowledge
of
her
affability
,
that
it
would
happen
.
<EOS>
but
who
could
have
foresee
such
an
attention
as
this
?
<EOS>
who
could
have
imagine
that
we
should
receive
an
invitation
to
dine
there
(
an
invitation
moreover
include
the
whole
party
)
<EOS>
so
immediately
after
your
arrival
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
the
less
surprised
at
what
have
happen
,
"
reply
Sir
William
,
"
from
that
knowledge
of
what
the
manner
of
the
great
really
be
,
which
my
situation
in
life
have
allow
me
to
acquire
.
<EOS>
about
the
Court
,
such
instance
of
elegant
breeding
be
not
uncommon
.
"
  
<EOS>
scarcely
any
thing
be
talk
of
the
whole
day
or
next
morning
,
but
their
visit
to
Rosings
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
be
carefully
instruct
them
in
what
they
be
to
expect
,
that
the
sight
of
such
room
,
so
many
servant
,
and
so
splendid
a
dinner
may
not
wholly
overpower
them
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
lady
be
separate
for
the
toilette
,
he
say
to
Elizabeth
,
  
"
do
not
make
yourself
uneasy
,
my
dear
cousin
,
about
your
apparel
.
<EOS>
Lady
Catherine
be
far
from
require
that
elegance
of
dress
in
us
,
which
become
herself
and
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
would
advise
you
merely
to
put
on
whatever
of
your
clothe
be
superior
to
the
rest
,
there
be
no
occasion
for
any
thing
more
.
<EOS>
Lady
Catherine
will
not
think
the
bad
of
you
for
be
simply
dress
.
<EOS>
She
like
to
have
the
distinction
of
rank
preserve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
while
they
be
dress
,
he
come
two
or
three
time
to
their
different
door
,
to
recommend
their
be
quick
,
as
Lady
Catherine
very
much
object
to
be
keep
wait
for
her
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
such
formidable
account
of
her
Ladyship
,
and
her
manner
of
living
,
quite
frighten
Maria
Lucas
,
who
have
be
little
use
to
company
,
and
she
look
forward
to
her
introduction
at
rosing
,
with
as
much
apprehension
,
as
her
father
have
do
to
his
presentation
at
St.
James
's
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
weather
be
fine
,
they
have
a
pleasant
walk
of
about
half
a
mile
across
the
park
.
 
<EOS>
every
park
have
its
beauty
and
its
prospect
;
and
Elizabeth
see
much
to
be
pleased
with
,
though
she
could
not
be
in
such
rapture
as
Mr.
Collins
expect
the
scene
to
inspire
,
and
be
but
slightly
affect
by
his
enumeration
of
the
window
in
front
of
the
house
,
and
his
relation
of
what
the
glazing
altogether
have
originally
cost
Sir
Lewis
De
Bourgh
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
ascend
the
step
to
the
hall
,
Maria
's
alarm
be
every
moment
increase
,
and
even
Sir
William
do
not
look
perfectly
calm
.
 
<EOS>
Elizabeth
's
courage
do
not
fail
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
hear
nothing
of
Lady
Catherine
that
speak
her
awful
from
any
extraordinary
talent
or
miraculous
virtue
,
and
the
mere
stateliness
of
money
and
rank
,
she
think
she
could
witness
without
trepidation
.
  
<EOS>
from
the
entrance
hall
,
of
which
Mr.
Collins
point
out
,
with
a
rapturous
air
,
the
fine
proportion
and
finished
ornament
,
they
follow
the
servant
through
an
anti
-
chamber
,
to
the
room
where
Lady
Catherine
,
her
daughter
,
and
Mrs.
Jenkinson
be
sit
.
 
<EOS>
Her
Ladyship
,
with
great
condescension
,
arise
to
receive
them
;
and
as
Mrs.
Collins
have
settle
it
with
her
husband
that
the
office
of
introduction
should
be
her
's
,
it
be
perform
in
a
proper
manner
,
without
any
of
those
apology
and
thank
which
he
would
have
think
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
in
spite
of
have
be
at
St.
James
's
,
Sir
William
be
so
completely
awed
,
by
the
grandeur
surround
him
,
that
he
have
but
just
courage
enough
to
make
a
very
low
bow
,
and
take
his
seat
without
say
a
word
;
and
his
daughter
,
frighten
almost
out
of
her
sense
,
sit
on
the
edge
of
her
chair
,
not
know
which
way
to
look
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
find
herself
quite
equal
to
the
scene
,
and
could
observe
the
three
lady
before
her
composedly
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Catherine
be
a
tall
,
large
woman
,
with
strongly
-
marked
feature
,
which
may
once
have
be
handsome
.
<EOS>
Her
air
be
not
conciliating
,
nor
be
her
manner
of
receive
them
,
such
as
to
make
her
visitor
forget
their
inferior
rank
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
render
formidable
by
silence
;
but
whatever
she
say
,
be
speak
in
so
authoritative
a
tone
,
as
mark
her
self
-
importance
,
and
bring
Mr.
Wickham
immediately
to
Elizabeth
's
mind
;
and
from
the
observation
of
the
day
altogether
,
she
believe
Lady
Catherine
to
be
exactly
what
he
have
represent
.
  
<EOS>
when
,
after
examine
the
mother
,
in
whose
countenance
and
deportment
she
soon
find
some
resemblance
of
Mr.
Darcy
,
she
turn
her
eye
on
the
daughter
,
she
could
almost
have
join
in
Maria
's
astonishment
,
at
her
be
so
thin
,
and
so
small
.
<EOS>
there
be
neither
in
figure
nor
face
,
any
likeness
between
the
lady
.
<EOS>
Miss
De
Bourgh
be
pale
and
sickly
;
her
feature
,
though
not
plain
,
be
insignificant
;
and
she
speak
very
little
,
except
in
a
low
voice
,
to
Mrs.
Jenkinson
,
in
whose
appearance
there
be
nothing
remarkable
,
and
who
be
entirely
engage
in
listen
to
what
she
say
,
and
place
a
screen
in
the
proper
direction
before
her
eye
.
  
<EOS>
after
sit
a
few
minute
,
they
be
all
send
to
one
of
the
window
,
to
admire
the
view
,
Mr.
Collins
attend
them
to
point
out
its
beauty
,
and
Lady
Catherine
kindly
inform
them
that
it
be
much
better
worth
look
at
in
the
summer
.
  
<EOS>
the
dinner
be
exceedingly
handsome
,
and
there
be
all
the
servant
,
and
all
the
article
of
plate
which
Mr.
Collins
have
promise
;
and
,
as
he
have
likewise
foretold
,
he
take
his
seat
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
,
by
her
ladyship
's
desire
,
and
look
as
if
he
feel
that
life
could
furnish
nothing
great
.
 
<EOS>
He
carve
,
and
eat
,
and
praise
with
delighted
alacrity
;
and
every
dish
be
commend
,
first
by
him
,
and
then
by
Sir
William
,
who
be
now
enough
recover
to
echo
whatever
his
son
in
law
say
,
in
a
manner
which
Elizabeth
wonder
Lady
Catherine
could
bear
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Catherine
seem
gratified
by
their
excessive
admiration
,
and
give
most
gracious
smile
,
especially
when
any
dish
on
the
table
prove
a
novelty
to
them
.
<EOS>
the
party
do
not
supply
much
conversation
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
ready
to
speak
whenever
there
be
an
opening
,
but
she
be
seat
between
Charlotte
and
Miss
De
Bourgh
 
the
former
of
whom
be
engage
in
listen
to
Lady
Catherine
,
and
the
latter
say
not
a
word
to
her
all
dinner
time
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Jenkinson
be
chiefly
employ
in
watch
how
little
Miss
De
Bourgh
eat
,
press
her
to
try
some
other
dish
,
and
fear
she
be
indispose
.
<EOS>
Maria
think
speak
out
of
the
question
,
and
the
gentleman
do
nothing
but
eat
and
admire
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
lady
return
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
there
be
little
to
be
do
but
to
hear
Lady
Catherine
talk
,
which
she
do
without
any
intermission
till
coffee
come
in
,
deliver
her
opinion
on
every
subject
in
so
decisive
a
manner
as
prove
that
she
be
not
use
to
have
her
judgment
controvert
.
<EOS>
She
enquire
into
Charlotte
's
domestic
concern
familiarly
and
minutely
,
and
give
her
a
great
deal
of
advice
,
as
to
the
management
of
them
all
;
tell
her
how
every
thing
ought
to
be
regulate
in
so
small
a
family
as
her
be
,
and
instruct
her
as
to
the
care
of
her
cow
and
her
poultry
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
find
that
nothing
be
beneath
this
great
Lady
's
attention
,
which
could
furnish
her
with
an
occasion
of
dictate
to
other
.
<EOS>
in
the
interval
of
her
discourse
with
Mrs.
Collins
,
she
address
a
variety
of
question
to
Maria
and
Elizabeth
,
but
especially
to
the
latter
,
of
whose
connection
she
know
the
least
,
and
who
she
observe
to
Mrs.
Collins
,
be
a
very
genteel
,
pretty
kind
of
girl
.
<EOS>
She
ask
her
at
different
time
,
how
many
sister
she
have
,
whether
they
be
old
or
young
than
herself
,
whether
any
of
them
be
likely
to
be
marry
,
whether
they
be
handsome
,
where
they
have
be
educate
,
what
carriage
her
father
keep
,
and
what
have
be
her
mother
's
maiden
name
?
 
<EOS>
Elizabeth
feel
all
the
impertinence
of
her
question
,
but
answer
them
very
composedly
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Catherine
then
observe
,
  
"
Your
father
's
estate
be
entail
on
Mr.
Collins
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
for
your
sake
,
"
turn
to
Charlotte
,
"
I
be
glad
of
it
;
but
otherwise
I
see
no
occasion
for
entail
estate
from
the
female
line
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
think
necessary
in
Sir
Lewis
de
Bourgh
's
family
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
play
and
sing
,
Miss
Bennet
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
then
 
some
time
or
other
we
shall
be
happy
to
hear
you
.
<EOS>
Our
instrument
be
a
capital
one
,
probably
superior
to
 
<EOS>
You
shall
try
it
some
day
.
 
<EOS>
do
your
sister
play
and
sing
?
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
one
of
them
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
not
you
all
learn
?
 
<EOS>
You
ought
all
to
have
learn
.
<EOS>
the
Miss
Webbs
all
play
,
and
their
father
have
not
so
good
an
income
as
your
'
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
draw
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
no
,
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
,
none
of
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
very
strange
.
<EOS>
but
I
suppose
you
have
no
opportunity
.
<EOS>
Your
mother
should
have
take
you
to
town
every
spring
for
the
benefit
of
master
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
mother
would
have
have
no
objection
,
but
my
father
hate
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
have
your
governess
leave
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
never
have
any
governess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
governess
!
<EOS>
how
be
that
possible
?
<EOS>
five
daughter
bring
up
at
home
without
a
governess
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
hear
of
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
Your
mother
must
have
be
quite
a
slave
to
your
education
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
could
hardly
help
smile
,
as
she
assure
her
that
have
not
be
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
who
teach
you
?
<EOS>
who
attend
to
you
?
<EOS>
without
a
governess
you
must
have
be
neglect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
compare
with
some
family
,
I
believe
we
be
;
but
such
of
us
as
wish
to
learn
,
never
want
the
mean
.
<EOS>
We
be
always
encourage
to
read
,
and
have
all
the
master
that
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
those
who
choose
to
be
idle
,
certainly
may
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
aye
,
no
doubt
;
but
that
be
what
a
governess
will
prevent
,
and
if
I
have
know
your
mother
,
I
should
have
advise
her
most
strenuously
to
engage
one
.
<EOS>
I
always
say
that
nothing
be
to
be
do
in
education
without
steady
and
regular
instruction
,
and
nobody
but
a
governess
can
give
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
wonderful
how
many
family
I
have
be
the
mean
of
supply
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
I
be
always
glad
to
get
a
young
person
well
place
out
.
<EOS>
four
niece
of
Mrs.
Jenkinson
be
most
delightfully
situate
through
my
mean
;
and
it
be
<EOS>
but
the
other
day
,
that
I
recommend
another
young
person
,
who
be
merely
accidentally
mention
to
me
,
and
the
family
be
quite
delighted
with
her
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Collins
,
do
I
tell
you
of
Lady
Metcalfe
's
call
yesterday
to
thank
me
?
<EOS>
She
find
Miss
Pope
a
treasure
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Catherine
,
"
say
she
,
"
you
have
give
me
a
treasure
.
<EOS>
"
be
any
of
your
young
sister
out
,
Miss
Bennet
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
madam
,
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
all
!
 
<EOS>
what
,
all
five
out
at
once
?
<EOS>
very
odd
!
 
<EOS>
and
you
only
the
second
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
one
out
before
the
elder
be
married
!
 
<EOS>
Your
young
sister
must
be
very
young
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
my
young
be
not
sixteen
.
<EOS>
perhaps
_
she
_
be
full
young
to
be
much
in
company
.
<EOS>
but
really
,
madam
,
I
think
it
would
be
very
hard
upon
young
sister
,
that
they
should
not
have
their
share
of
society
and
amusement
because
the
elder
may
not
have
the
mean
or
inclination
to
marry
early
.
 
<EOS>
the
last
bear
have
as
good
a
right
to
the
pleasure
of
youth
,
as
the
first
.
<EOS>
and
to
be
keep
back
on
_
such
_
a
motive
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
not
be
very
likely
to
promote
sisterly
affection
or
delicacy
of
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
upon
my
word
,
"
say
her
Ladyship
,
"
you
give
your
opinion
very
decidedly
for
so
young
a
person
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
what
be
your
age
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
with
three
young
sister
grow
up
,
"
reply
Elizabeth
smile
,
"
your
ladyship
can
hardly
expect
me
to
own
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Catherine
seem
quite
astonished
at
not
receive
a
direct
answer
;
and
Elizabeth
suspect
herself
to
be
the
first
creature
who
have
ever
dare
to
trifle
with
so
much
dignified
impertinence
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
be
more
than
twenty
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
,
 
therefore
you
need
not
conceal
your
age
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
one
and
twenty

"
  
<EOS>
when
the

<EOS>
Lady

play
at
cassino
,
the
two
girl
have
the
honour
of
assist
Mrs.
Jenkinson
to
make
up
her
party
.
<EOS>
Their
table
be
superlatively
stupid
.
<EOS>
scarcely
a
syllable
be
utter
that
do
not
relate
to
the

except
when
Mrs.
Jenkinson
express
her

of
Miss

hot
or

<EOS>
Lady
Catherine

state
the
mistake
of

<EOS>
Sir

do
not

much
.
<EOS>
He
be
store
his
memory
with
anecdote
and
noble
name

<EOS>
when
Lady

and
her

as
they

the
table

break
up

the

gratefully
accept
,
and
immediately

<EOS>
the
party
then
gather
round
the
fire
to
hear
Lady
Catherine
determine
what
weather
they
be
to
have
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
from
these
instruction
they
be
summon
by
the
arrival
of
the
coach
,
and
with
many
speech
of
thankfulness
on
Mr.
Collins
's
side
,
and
as
many
bow
on
Sir
William
's
,
they
depart
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
have
drive
from
the
door
,
Elizabeth
be
call
on
by
her
cousin
,
to
give
her
opinion
of
all
that
she
have
see
at
Rosings
,
which
,
for
Charlotte
's
sake
,
she
make
more
favourable
than
it
really
be
.
<EOS>
but
her
commendation
,
though
cost
her
some
trouble
,
could
by
no
means
satisfy
Mr.
Collins
,
and
he
be
very
soon
oblige
to
take
her
Ladyship
's
praise
into
his
own
hand
.
    
<EOS>
Sir
William
staid
only
a
week
at
Hunsford
;
but
his
visit
be
long
enough
to
convince
him
of
his
daughter
's
be
most
comfortably
settle
,
and
of
her
possess
such
a
husband
and
such
a
neighbour
as
be
not
often
meet
with
.
<EOS>
while
Sir
William
be
with
them
,
Mr.
Collins
devote
his
morning
to
drive
him
out
in
his
gig
,
and
shew
him
the
country
;
but
when
he
go
away
,
the
whole
family
return
to
their
usual
employment
,
and
Elizabeth
be
thankful
to
find
that
they
do
not
see
more
of
her
cousin
by
the
alteration
,
for
the
chief
of
the
time
between
breakfast
and
dinner
<EOS>
be
now
pass
by
him
either
at
work
in
the
garden
,
or
in
reading
and
writing
,
and
look
out
of
window
in
his
own
book
room
,
which
front
the
road
.
<EOS>
the
room
in
which
the
lady
sit
be
backwards
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
at
first
have
rather
wonder
that
Charlotte
should
not
prefer
the
dining
-
parlour
for
common
use
;
it
be
a
better
sized
room
,
and
have
a
pleasanter
aspect
;
but
she
soon
see
that
her
friend
have
an
excellent
reason
for
what
she
do
,
for
Mr.
Collins
would
undoubtedly
have
be
much
less
in
his
own
apartment
,
have
they
sit
in
one
equally
lively
;
and
she
give
Charlotte
credit
for
the
arrangement
.
  
<EOS>
from
the
drawing
-
room
they
could
distinguish
nothing
in
the
lane
,
and
be
indebte
to
Mr.
Collins
for
the
knowledge
of
what
carriage
go
along
,
and
how
often
especially
Miss
De
Bourgh
drive
by
in
her
phaeton
,
which
he
never
fail
come
to
inform
them
of
,
though
it
happen
almost
every
day
.
<EOS>
She
not
unfrequently
stop
at
the
Parsonage
,
and
have
a
few
minute
'
conversation
with
Charlotte
,
but
be
scarcely
ever
prevail
on
to
get
out
.
  
<EOS>
very
few
day
pass
in
which
Mr.
Collins
do
not
walk
to
Rosings
,
and
not
many
in
which
his
wife
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
go
likewise
;
and
till
Elizabeth
recollect
that
there
may
be
other
family
living
to
be
dispose
of
<EOS>
,
she
could
not
understand
the
sacrifice
of
so
many
hour
.
<EOS>
now
and
then
,
they
be
honour
with
a
call
from
her
Ladyship
,
and
nothing
escape
her
observation
that
be
pass
in
the
room
during
these
visit
.
<EOS>
She
examine
into
their
employment
,
look
at
their
work
,
and
advise
them
to
do
it
differently
;
find
fault
with
the
arrangement
of
the
furniture
,
or
detect
the
housemaid
in
negligence
;
and
if
she
accept
any
refreshment
,
seem
to
do
it
only
for
the
sake
of
find
out
that
Mrs.
Collins
's
joint
of
meat
be
too
large
for
her
family
.
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
soon
perceive
that
though
this
great
lady
be
not
in
the
commission
of
the
peace
for
the
county
,
she
be
a
most
active
magistrate
in
her
own
parish
,
the
minute
concern
of
which
be
carry
to
her
by
Mr.
Collins
;
and
whenever
any
of
the
cottager
be
dispose
to
be
quarrelsome
,
discontent
or
too
poor
,
she
sally
forth
into
the
village
to
settle
their
difference
,
silence
their
complaint
,
and
scold
them
into
harmony
and
plenty
.
  
<EOS>
the
entertainment
of
dining
at
Rosings
be
repeat
about
twice
a
week
;
and
,
allow
for
the
loss
of
Sir
William
,
and
there
be
only
one
card
table
in
the
evening
,
every
such
entertainment
be
the
counterpart
of
the
first
.
<EOS>
Their
other
engagement
be
few
;
as
the
style
of
living
of
the
neighbourhood
in
general
,
be
beyond
the
Collinses
'
reach
.
<EOS>
this
however
be
no
evil
to
Elizabeth
,
and
upon
the
whole
she
spend
her
time
comfortably
enough
;
there
be
half
hour
of
pleasant
conversation
with
Charlotte
,
and
the
weather
be
so
fine
for
the
time
of
year
,
that
she
have
often
great
enjoyment
out
of
door
.
<EOS>
Her
favourite
walk
,
and
where
she
frequently
go
while
the
other
be
call
on
Lady
Catherine
,
be
along
the
open
grove
which
edge
that
side
of
the
park
,
where
there
be
a
nice
shelter
path
,
which
no
one
seem
to
value
but
herself
,
and
where
she
feel
beyond
the
reach
of
Lady
Catherine
's
curiosity
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
quiet
way
,
the
first
fortnight
of
her
visit
soon
pass
away
.
<EOS>
Easter
be
approach
,
and
the
week
precede
it
,
be
to
bring
an
addition
to
the
family
at
Rosings
,
which
in
so
small
a
circle
must
be
important
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
have
hear
soon
after
her
arrival
,
that
Mr.
Darcy
be
expect
there
in
the
course
of
a
few
week
,
and
though
there
be
not
many
of
her
acquaintance
whom
she
do
not
prefer
,
his
come
would
furnish
one
comparatively
new
to
look
at
in
their
Rosings
party
,
and
she
may
be
amuse
in
see
how
hopeless
Miss
Bingley
's
design
on
him
be
,
by
his
behaviour
to
his
cousin
,
for
whom
he
be
evidently
destine
by
Lady
Catherine
;
who
talk
of
his
come
with
the
great
satisfaction
,
speak
of
him
in
term
of
the
high
admiration
,
and
seem
almost
angry
to
find
that
he
have
already
be
frequently
see
by
Miss
Lucas
and
herself
.
  
<EOS>
His
arrival
be
soon

the
Parsonage
,
for
Mr.
Collins

whole
morning
within
view
of
the
lodge
open
into
Hunsford
Lane
,
in
order
to
have
the
early
assurance
of
it
;
and
after
make
his
bow
as
the
carriage
turn
into
the
Park
,
hurried
home
with
the
great
intelligence
.
<EOS>
on

<EOS>
Charlotte

and
immediately
run
into
the
other

tell
the
girl
what
an
honour
they
may
expect
,
add
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
thank
you
,
Eliza
,
for
this
piece
of
civility
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
would
never
have
come
so
soon
to
wait
upon
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
have
scarcely
time
to
disclaim
all
right
to
the
compliment
,
before
their
approach

and
shortly
afterwards

.
<EOS>
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
,
who
lead
the
way
,
be
about
thirty
,
not
handsome
,
but
in
person
and
address
most
truly
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
look
just
as
he
have
be
use
to
look
in
Hertfordshire
,
pay
his
compliment
,
with
his
usual
reserve
,
to
Mrs.
Collins
;
and
whatever
may
be
his
feeling
towards
her
friend
,
meet
her
with
every
appearance
of
composure
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
merely
curtsey
to
him
,
without
say
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
enter
into
conversation
directly
with
the
readiness
and
ease
of
a
well
-
breed
man
,
and
talk
very
pleasantly
;
but
his
cousin
,
after
have
address
a
slight
observation
on
the
house
and
garden
to
Mrs.
Collins
,
sit
for
some
time
without
speak
to
any
body
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
his
civility
be
so
far
awaken
as
to
enquire
of
Elizabeth
after
the
health
of
her
family
.
<EOS>
She
answer
him
in
the
usual
way
,
and
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
add
,
  
"
My
eld
sister
have
be
in
town
these
three
month
.
<EOS>
have
you
never
happen
to
see
her
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
perfectly
sensible
that
he
never
have
;
but
she
wish
to
see
whether
he
would
betray
any
consciousness
of
what
have
pass
between
the
Bingleys
and
Jane
;
and
she
think
he
look
a
little
confused
as
he
answer
that
he
have
never
be
so
fortunate
as
to
meet
Miss
Bennet
.
<EOS>
the
subject
be
pursue
no
farther
,
and
the
gentleman
soon
afterwards
go
away
.
    
<EOS>
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
's
manner
be
very
much
admire
at
the
parsonage
,
and
the
lady
all
feel
that
he
must
add
considerably
to
the
pleasure
of
their
engagement
at
rosing
.
<EOS>
It
be
some
day
,
however
,
before
they
receive
any
invitation
thither
,
for
while
there
be
visitor
in
the
house
,
they
could
not
be
necessary
;
and
it
be
not
till
Easter
-
day
,
almost
a
week
after
the
gentleman
's
arrival
,
that
they
be
honour
by
such
an
attention
,
and
then
they
be
merely
ask
on
leave
church
to
come
there
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
for
the
last
week
they
have
see
very
little
of
either
Lady
Catherine
or
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
have
call
at
the
parsonage
more
than
once
during
the
time
,
but
Mr.
Darcy
they
have
only

of
course
,
and
at
a
proper
hour
they
join
the
party
in
Lady
Catherine
's
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
receive
them
civilly
,
but
it
be
plain
that
their
company
be
by
no
means
<EOS>
so
acceptable
as
when
she
could
get
nobody
else
;
and
she
be
,
in
fact
,
almost
engross
by
her
nephews
,
speak
to
them
,
especially
to
Darcy
,
much
more
than
to
any
other
person
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
seem
really
glad
to
see
them
;
any
thing
be
a
welcome
relief
to
him
at
rosing
;
and
Mrs.
Collins
's
pretty
friend
have
moreover
catch
his
fancy
very
much
.
<EOS>
He
now
seat
himself
by
her

and

so
agreeably
of
Kent
and
Hertfordshire
,
of
travel
and
stay
at
home
,
of
new
book
and
music
,
that
Elizabeth
have
never
be
half
so
well
entertain
in
that
room
before
;
and
they
converse
with
so
much
spirit
and
flow
,
as
to
draw
the
attention
of
Lady
Catherine
herself
,
as
well
as
of
Mr.
Darcy
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
His

eye
have
be
soon
and
repeatedly

look
of
curiosity

her
ladyship
after
a
while
share
the
feeling

for
she

to
call
out
,

We

when
no

of
music

<EOS>
then
pray
speak
aloud

<EOS>
It
be
of
all
subject
my
delight
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
my
share
in
the
conversation
,
if
you
be
speak
of
music

<EOS>
there
be
few
people
in
England
,
I
suppose
,
who
have
more
true
enjoyment
of
music
than
myself
,
or
a
better
natural
taste
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
ever
learn
,
I
should
have
be
a
great
proficient
.
<EOS>
and
so
would
Anne
,
if
her
health
have
allow
her
to
apply
.
<EOS>
I
be
confident
that
she
would
have
perform
delightfully
.
<EOS>
how
do
Georgiana
get
on
,
Darcy
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
speak
with
affectionate
praise
of
his
sister
's
proficiency
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
to
hear
such
a
good
account
of
her
,
"
say
Lady
Catherine
;
"
and
pray
tell
her
from
me
,
that
she
can
not
expect
to
excel
,
if
she
do
not
practise
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
Madam
,
"
he
reply
,
"
that
she
do
not

such
advice

<EOS>
She
practise
very
constantly

<EOS>
"
so
much
the
well
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
do
too
much
;
and
when
I
next
write
to
her
,
I
shall
charge
her
not
to
neglect
it
on
any
account

<EOS>
I
often
tell
young
lady
,
that
no
excellence
in
music
be
to
be
acquire
,
without
constant
practice

<EOS>
I
have
tell
Miss
Bennet
several
time
,
that
she
will
never
play
really
well
,
unless
she
practise
more
;
and
though
Mrs.
Collins
have
no
instrument
,
she
be
very
welcome
,
as
I
have
often
tell
her
,
to
come
to
Rosings
every
day
,
and
play
on
the
piano
-
forte
in
Mrs.
Jenkinson
's
room

She
would
be
in
nobody

way

you
know

part

the
house

<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
look
a
little
ashamed
of
his
aunt
's
ill
breeding

make
no
answer

<EOS>
when
coffee
be
over
,
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
remind
Elizabeth
of
have
promise
to
play
to
him
;
and
she
sit
down
directly
to
the
instrument

He
draw
a
chair
near
her

<EOS>
Lady
Catherine
listen
to
half
a
song
,

then
talk
,
as
before
,
to
her
other
nephew
;
till
the
latter
walk
away
from
her
,
and
move
with
his
usual
deliberation
towards
the
piano

forte
,
station
himself
so
as
to
command
a
full
view
of
the
fair
performer
's
countenance
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
see
what
he
be
do
,
and
at
the
first
convenient
pause
,
turn
to
him
with
an
arch
smile
,
and
say
,
  
"
You
mean
to
frighten
me
,
Mr.
Darcy
,
by
come
in
all
this
state
to
hear
me
?
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
be
alarm
though
your
sister
_
do
_
play
so
well
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
stubbornness
about
me
that
never
can
bear
to
be
frighten
at
the
will
of
other
.
<EOS>
My
courage
always
rise
with
every
attempt
to
intimidate
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
say
that
you
be
mistaken
,
"
he
reply
,
"
because
you
could
not
really
believe
me
to
entertain
any
design
of
alarm
you
;
and
I
have
have
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
long
enough
to
know
,
that
you
find
great
enjoyment
in
occasionally
profess
opinion
which
in
fact
be
not
your
own

"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
laugh
heartily
at
this
picture
of
herself
,
and
say
to
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
,
"
Your
cousin
will
give
you
a
very
pretty
notion
of
me
,
and
teach
you
not
to
believe
a
word
I
say
.
<EOS>
I
be
particularly
unlucky
in
meeting
with
a
person
so
well
able
to
expose
my
real
character
,
in
a
part
of
the
world
,
where
I
have
hope
to
pass
myself
off
with
some
degree
of
credit
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
Mr.
Darcy
,
it
be
very
ungenerous
in
you
to
mention
all
that
you
know
to
my
disadvantage
in
Hertfordshire
 
and
,
give
me
leave
to
say
,
very
impolitic
too
 
for
it
be
provoke
me
to
retaliate
,
and
such
thing
may
come
out
,
as
will
shock
your
relation
to
hear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
afraid
of
you
,
"
say
he
,
smilingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
pray
let
me
hear
what
you
have
to
accuse
him
of
,
"
cry
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
know
how
he
behave
among
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
hear
then
 
but
prepare
yourself
for
something
very
dreadful
.
<EOS>
the
first
time
of
my
ever
see
him
in
Hertfordshire
,
you
must
know
,
be
at
a
ball
 
and
at
this
ball
,
what
do
you
think
he
do
?
<EOS>
He
dance
only
four
dance
!
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
pain
you
 
<EOS>
but
so
it
be
.
<EOS>
He
dance
only
four
dance
,
though
gentleman
be
scarce
;
and
,
to
my
certain
knowledge
,
more
than
one
young
lady
be
sit
down
in
want
of
a
partner
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
,
you
can
not
deny
the
fact
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
at
that
time
the
honour
of
know
any
lady
in
the
assembly
beyond
my
own
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
true
;
and
nobody
can
ever
be
introduce
in
a
ball
room
.
<EOS>
well
,
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
,
what
do
I
play
next
?
<EOS>
My
finger
wait
your
order
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
"
say
Darcy
,
"
I
should
have
judge
better
,
have
I
seek
an
introduction
,
but
I
be
ill
qualified
to
recommend
myself
to
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Shall
we
ask
your
cousin
the
reason
of
this
?
"
say
Elizabeth
,
still
address
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
.
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
ask
him
why
a
man
of
sense
and
education
,
and
who
have
live
in
the
world
,
be
ill
qualified
to
recommend
himself
to
stranger
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
answer
your
question
,
"
say
Fitzwilliam
,
"
without
apply
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
because
he
will
not
give
himself
the
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
have
not
the
talent
which
some
people
possess
,
"
say
Darcy
,
"
of
converse
easily
with
those
I
have
never
see
before
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
catch
their
tone
of
conversation
,
or
appear
interested
in
their
concern
,
as
I
often
see
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
finger
,
"
say
Elizabeth
,
"
do
not
move
over
this
instrument
in
the
masterly
manner
which
I
see
so
many
woman
's
do
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
the
same
force
or
rapidity
,
and
do
not
produce
the
same
expression
.
<EOS>
but
then
I
have
always
suppose
it
to
be
my
own
fault
 
because
I
would
not
take
the
trouble
of
practise
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
that
I
do
not
believe
_
my
_
finger
as
capable
as
any
other
woman
's
of
superior
execution
.
"
  
<EOS>
Darcy
smile
and
say
,
"
You
be
perfectly
right
.
<EOS>
You
have
employ
your
time
much
better
.
<EOS>
no
one
admit
to
the
privilege
of
hear
you
,
can
think
any
thing
want
.
<EOS>
We
neither
of
us
perform
to
stranger

"
  
<EOS>
here
they
be
interrupt
by
Lady
Catherine
,
who
call
out
to
know
what
they
be
talk
of
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
immediately
begin
play
again
.
<EOS>
Lady
Catherine
approach
,
and
,
after
listen
for
a
few
minute
,
say
to
Darcy
,
  
"
Miss
Bennet
would
not
play
at
all
amiss
,
if
she
practise
more
,
and
could
have
the
advantage
of
a
London
master
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
very
good
notion
of
fingering
,
though
her
taste
be
not
equal
to
Anne
's
.
<EOS>
Anne
would
have
be
a
delightful
performer
,
have
her
health
allow
her
to
learn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
look
at
Darcy
to
see
how
cordially
he
assent
to
his
cousin
's
praise
;
but
neither
at
that
moment
nor
at
any
other
could
she
discern
any
symptom
of
love
;
and
from
the
whole
of
his
behaviour
to
Miss
De
Bourgh
she
derive
this
comfort
for
Miss
Bingley
,
that
he
may
have
be
just
as
likely
to
marry
_
her
_
<EOS>
,
have
she
be
his
relation
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Catherine
continue
her
remark
on
Elizabeth
's
performance
,
mix
with
them
many
instruction
on
execution
and
taste
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
receive
them
with
all
the
forbearance
of
civility
;
and
at
the
request
of
the
gentleman
remain
at
the
instrument
till
her
Ladyship
's
carriage
be
ready
to
take
them
all
home
.
    
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
sit
by
herself
the
next
morning
,
and
write
to
Jane
,
while
Mrs.
Collins
and
Maria
be
go
on
business
into
the
village
,
when
she
be
startle
by
a
ring
at
the
door
,
the
certain
signal
of
a
visitor
.
<EOS>
as
she
have
hear
no
carriage
,
she
think
it
not
unlikely
to
be
Lady
Catherine
,
and
under
that
apprehension
be
put
away
her
half
-
finished
letter
that
she
may
escape
all
impertinent
question
,
when
the
door
open
,
and
to
her
very
great
surprise
,
Mr.
Darcy
,
and
Mr.
Darcy
only
,
enter
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
He
seem
astonished
too
on
find
her
alone
,
and
apologise
for
his
intrusion
,
by
let
her
know
that
he
have
understand
all
the
lady
to
be
within
.
  
<EOS>
They
then
sit
down
,
and
when
her
enquiry
after
rosing
be
make
,
seem
in
danger
of
sink
into
total
silence
.
<EOS>
It
be
absolutely
necessary
,
therefore
,
to
think
of
something
,
and
in
this
emergence
recollect
_
when
_
she
have
see
him
last
in
Hertfordshire
,
and
feel
curious
to
know
what
he
would
say
on
the
subject
of
their
hasty
departure
,
she
observe
,
  
<EOS>
"
how
very
suddenly
you
all
quit
Netherfield
last
November
,
Mr.
Darcy
!
<EOS>
It
must
have
be
a
most
agreeable
surprise
to
Mr.
Bingley
to
see
you
all
after
him
so
soon
;
for
,
if
I
recollect
right
,
he
go
but
<EOS>
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
sister
be
well
,
I
hope
,
when
you
leave
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perfectly
so
 
I
thank
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
find
that
she
be
to
receive
no
other
answer
 
and
,
after
a
short
pause
,
add
,
  
"
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
understand
that
Mr.
Bingley
have
not
much
idea
of
ever
return
to
Netherfield
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
hear
him
say
so
;
but
it
be
probable
that
he
may
spend
very
little
of
his
time
there
in
future
.
<EOS>
He
have
many
friend
,
and
he
be
at
a
time
of
life
when
friend
and
engagement
be
continually
increase
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
he
mean
to
be
but
little
at
Netherfield
,
it
would
be
well
for
the
neighbourhood
that
he
should
give
up
the
place
entirely
,
for
then
we
may
possibly
get
a
settle
family
there
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
Mr.
Bingley
do
not
take
the
house
so
much
for
the
convenience
of
the
neighbourhood
as
for
his
own
,
and
we
must
expect
him
to
keep
or
quit
it
on
the
same
principle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
be
surprised
,
"
say
Darcy
,
"
if
he
be
to
give
it
up
,
as
soon
as
any
eligible
purchase
offer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
make
no
answer
.
<EOS>
She
be
afraid
of
talk
longer
of
his
friend
;
and
,
have
nothing
else
to
say
,
be
now
determine
to
leave
the
trouble
of
find
a
subject
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
take
the
hint
,
and
soon
begin
with
,
"
this
seem
a
very
comfortable
house
.
<EOS>
Lady
Catherine
,
I
believe
,
do
a
great
deal
to
it
when
Mr.
Collins
first
come
to
Hunsford
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
she
do
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
sure
she
could
not
have
bestow
her
kindness
on
a
more
grateful
object
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Collins
appear
very
fortunate
in
his
choice
of
a
wife
.
"
  
"
yes
,
indeed
;
his
friend
may
well
rejoice
in
his
have
meet
with
one
of
the
very
few
sensible
woman
who
would
have
accept
him
,
or
have
make
him
happy
if
they
have
.
<EOS>
My
friend
have
an
excellent
understanding
 
though
I
be
not
certain
that
I
consider
her
marry
Mr.
Collins
as
the
wise
thing
she
ever
do
.
<EOS>
She
seem
perfectly
happy
,
however
,
and
in
a
prudential
light
,
it
be
certainly
a
very
good
match
for
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
very
agreeable
to
her
to
be
settle
within
so
easy
a
distance
of
her
own
family
and
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
an
easy
distance
<EOS>
do
you
call
it
?
<EOS>
It
be
nearly
fifty
mile
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
be
fifty
mile
of
good
road
?
<EOS>
little
more
than
half
a
day
's
journey
.
<EOS>
yes
,
I
call
it
a
_
very
_
easy
distance
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
I
should
never
have
consider
the
distance
as
one
of
the
_
advantage
_
of
the
match
,
"
cry
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
never
have
say
Mrs.
Collins
be
settle
_
near
_
her
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
proof
of
your
own
attachment
to
Hertfordshire
.
<EOS>
any
thing
beyond
the
very
neighbourhood
of
Longbourn
,
I
suppose
,
would
appear
far
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
he
speak
there
be
a
sort
of
smile
,
which
Elizabeth
fancy
she
understand
;
he
must
be
suppose
her
to
be
think
of
Jane
and
Netherfield
,
and
she
blush
as
she
answer
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
a
woman
may
not
be
settle
too
near
her
family
.
<EOS>
the
far
and
the
near
must
be
relative
,
and
depend
on
many
varying
circumstance
.
<EOS>
where
there
be
fortune
to
make
the
expence
of
travel
unimportant
,
distance
become
no
evil

<EOS>
but
that
be
not
the
case
_
here

<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Collins
have
a
comfortable
income
,
but
not
such
a
one
as
will
allow
of
frequent
journey
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
persuade
my
friend
<EOS>
would
not
call
herself
_
near
_
her
family
under
less
than
_
half
_
the
present
distance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
draw
his
chair
a
little
towards
her
,
and
say
,
"
_
<EOS>
You
_
can
not
have
a
right
to
such
very
strong
local
attachment
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
_
can
not
have
be
always
at
Longbourn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
look
surprised
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
experience
some
change
of
feeling
;
he
draw
back
his
chair
,
take
a
newspaper
from
the
table
,
and
,
glance
over
it
,
say
,
in
a
cold
voice
,
  
"
<EOS>
be
you
pleased
with
Kent
?
"
  
<EOS>
a
short
dialogue
on
the
subject
of
the
country
ensue
,
on
either
side
calm
and
concise
 
and
soon
put
an
end
to
by
the
entrance
of
Charlotte
and
her
sister
,
just
return
from
their
walk
.
<EOS>
the
tête
-
à
-
tête
surprise
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
relate
the
mistake
which
have
occasion
his
intruding
on
Miss
Bennet
,
and
after
sit
a
few
minute
longer
without
say
much
to
any
body
,
go
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
this
!
"
say
Charlotte
,
as
soon
as
he
be
go
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Eliza
he
must
be
in
love
with
you
,
or
he
would
never
have
call
on
us
in
this
familiar
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
when
Elizabeth
tell
of
his
silence
,
it
do
not
seem
very
likely
,
even
to
Charlotte
's
wish
,
to
be
the
case
;
and
after
various
conjecture
,
they
could
at
last
only
suppose
his
visit
to
proceed
from
the
difficulty
of
find
any
thing
to
do
,
which
be
the
more
probable
from
the
time
of
year
.
<EOS>
all
field
sport
be
over
.
<EOS>
within
door
there
be
Lady
Catherine
,
book
,
and
a
billiard
table
,
but
gentleman
can
not
be
always
within
door
;
and
in
the
nearness
of
the
Parsonage
,
or
the
pleasantness
of
the
walk
to
it
,
or
of
the
people
who
live
in
it
,
the
two
cousin
find
a
temptation
from
this
period
of
walk
thither
almost
every
day
.
<EOS>
They
call
at
various
time
of
the
morning
,
sometimes
separately
,
sometimes
together
,
and
now
and
then
accompany
by
their
aunt
.
<EOS>
It
be
plain
to
them
all
that
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
come
because
he
have
pleasure
in
their
society
,
a
persuasion
which
of
course
recommend
him
still
more
;
and
Elizabeth
be
remind
by
her
own
satisfaction
in
be
with
him
,
as
well
as
by
his
evident
admiration
of
her
,
of
her
former
favourite
George
Wickham
;
and
though
,
in
compare
them
,
she
see
there
be
less
captivate
softness
in
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
's
manner
,
she
believe
he
may
have
the
best
informed
mind
.
  
<EOS>
but
why
Mr.
Darcy
come
so
often
to
the
Parsonage
,
it
be
more
difficult
to
understand
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
for
society
,
as
he
frequently
sit
there
ten
minute
together
without
open
his
lip
;
and
when
he
do
speak
,
it
seem
the
effect
of
necessity
rather
than
of
choice
 
a
sacrifice
to
propriety
,
not
a
pleasure
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
seldom
appear
really
animate
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Collins
know
not
what
to
make
of
him
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
's
occasionally
laugh
at
his
stupidity
,
prove
that
he
be
generally
different
,
which
her
own
knowledge
of
him
could
not
have
tell
her
;
and
as
she
would
have
like
to
believe
this
change
the
effect
of
love
,
and
the
object
of
that
love
,
her
friend
Eliza
,
she
sit
herself
seriously
to
work
to
find
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
She
watch
him
whenever
they
be
at
Rosings
,
and
whenever
he
come
to
Hunsford
;
but
without
much
success
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
look
at
her
friend
a
great
deal
,
but
the
expression
of
that
look
be
disputable
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
earnest
,
steadfast
gaze
,
but
she
often
doubt
whether
there
be
much
admiration
in
it
,
and
sometimes
it
seem
nothing
but
absence
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
once
or
twice
suggest
to
Elizabeth
the
possibility
of
his
be
partial
to
her
,
but
Elizabeth
always
laugh
at
the
idea
;
and
Mrs.
Collins
do
not
think
it
right
to
press
the
subject
,
from
the
danger
of
raise
expectation
which
may
only
end
in
disappointment
;
for
in
her
opinion
it
admit
not
of
a
doubt
,
that
all
her
friend
's
dislike
would
vanish
,
if
she
could
suppose
him
to
be
in
her
power
.
  
<EOS>
in
her
kind
scheme
for
Elizabeth
,
she
sometimes
plan
her
marry
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
.
<EOS>
He
be
beyond
comparison
the
pleasantest
man
;
he
certainly
admire
her
,
and
his
situation
in
life
be
most
eligible
;
but
,
to
counterbalance
these
advantage
,
Mr.
Darcy
have
considerable
patronage
in
the
church
,
and
his
cousin
could
have
none
at
all
.
    
<EOS>
More
than
once
do
Elizabeth
in
her
ramble
within
the
Park
,
unexpectedly
meet
Mr.
Darcy
.
 
<EOS>
She
feel
all
the
perverseness
of
the
mischance
that
should
bring
him
where
no
one
else
be
bring
;
and
to
prevent
its
ever
happen
again
,
take
care
to
inform
him
at
first
,
that
it
be
a
favourite
haunt
of
hers
.
 
<EOS>
how
it
could
occur
a
second
time
therefore
be
very
odd
!
 
<EOS>
yet
it
do
,
and
even
a
third
.
<EOS>
It
seem
like
wilful
ill
-
nature
,
or
a
voluntary
penance
,
for
on
these
occasion
it
be
not
merely
a
few
formal
enquiry
and
an
awkward
pause
and
then
away
,
but
he
actually
think
it
necessary
to
turn
back
and
walk
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
never
say
a
great
deal
,
nor
do
she
give
herself
the
trouble
of
talking
or
of
listen
much
;
but
it
strike
her
in
the
course
of
their
third
rencontre
that
he
be
ask
some
odd
unconnected
question
 
about
her
pleasure
in
be
at
Hunsford
,
her
love
of
solitary
walk
,
and
her
opinion
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Collins
's
happiness
;
and
that
in
speak
of
Rosings
and
her
not
perfectly
understand
the
house
,
he
seem
to
expect
that
whenever
she
come
into
Kent
again
she
would
be
stay
_
there
_
too
.
<EOS>
His
word
seem
to
imply
it
.
<EOS>
Could
he
have
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
in
his
thought
?
<EOS>
She
suppose
,
if
he
mean
any
thing
,
he
must
mean
an
allusion
to
what
may
arise
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
It
distress
her
a
little
,
and
she
be
quite
glad
to
find
herself
at
the
gate
in
the
pale
opposite
the
Parsonage
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
engage
one
day
as
she
walk
,
in
re
-
peruse
Jane
's
last
letter
,
and
dwell
on
some
passage
which
prove
that
Jane
have
not
write
in
spirit
,
when
,
instead
of
be
again
surprise
by
Mr.
Darcy
,
she
see
on
look
up
that
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
be
meet
her
.
<EOS>
put
away
the
letter
immediately
and
force
a
smile
,
she
say
,
  
"
I
do
not
know
before
that
you
ever
walk
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
make
the
tour
of
the
Park
,
"
he
reply
,
"
as
I
generally
do
every
year
,
and
intend
to
close
it
with
a
call
at
the
Parsonage
.
<EOS>
be
you
go
much
farther
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
should
have
turn
in
a
moment
.
"
  
<EOS>
and
accordingly
she
do
turn
,
and
they
walk
towards
the
Parsonage
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
certainly
leave
Kent
on
Saturday
?
"
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
 
if
Darcy
do
not
put
it
off
again
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
at
his
disposal
.
<EOS>
He
arrange
the
business
just
as
he
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
if
not
able
to
please
himself
in
the
arrangement
,
he
have
at
least
great
pleasure
in
the
power
of
choice
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
any
body
who
seem
more
to
enjoy
the
power
of
do
what
he
like
than
Mr.
Darcy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
like
to
have
his
own
way
very
well
,
"
reply
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
.
<EOS>
"
but
so
we
all
do
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
that
he
have
well
mean
of
have
it
than
many
other
,
because
he
be
rich
,
and
many
other
be
poor
.
<EOS>
I
speak
feelingly
.
<EOS>
a
young
son
,
you
know
,
must
be
inure
to
self
-
denial
and
dependence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
my
opinion
,
the
young
son
of
an
Earl
can
know
very
little
of
either
.
<EOS>
now
,
seriously
,
what
have
you
ever
know
of
self
-
denial
and
dependence
?
<EOS>
when
have
you
be
prevent
by
want
of
money
from
go
wherever
you
choose
,
or
procure
any
thing
you
have
a
fancy
for
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
these
be
home
question
 
<EOS>
and
perhaps
I
can
not
say
that
I
have
experience
many
hardship
of
that
nature
.
<EOS>
but
in
matter
of
great
weight
,
I
may
suffer
from
the
want
of
money
.
<EOS>
young
son
can
not
marry
where
they
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
unless
where
they
like
woman
of
fortune
,
which
I
think
they
very
often
do
.
"
  
"
Our
habit
of
expence
make
us
too
dependant
,
and
there
be
not
many
in
my
rank
of
life
who
can
afford
to
marry
without
some
attention
to
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
this
,
"
think
Elizabeth
,
"
mean
for
me
?
"
<EOS>
and
she
colour
at
the
idea
;
but
,
<EOS>
recover
herself
,
say
in
a
lively
tone
,
"
and
pray
,
what
be
the
usual
price
of
an
Earl
's
young
son
?
<EOS>
unless
the
eld
brother
be
very
sickly
,
I
suppose
you
would
not
ask
above
fifty
thousand
pound
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
answer
her
in
the
same
style
,
and
the
subject
drop
.
<EOS>
to
interrupt
a
silence
which
may
make
him
fancy
her
affect
with
what
have
pass
,
she
soon
afterwards
say
,
  
"
<EOS>
I
imagine
your
cousin
bring
you
down
with
him
chiefly
for
the
sake
of
have
somebody
at
his
disposal
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
he
do
not
marry
,
to
secure
a
lasting
convenience
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
but
,
perhaps
his
sister
do
as
well
for
the
present
,
and
,
as
she
be
under
his
sole
care
,
he
may
do
what
he
like
with
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
,
"
that
be
an
advantage
which
he
must
divide
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
join
with
him
in
the
guardianship
of
Miss
Darcy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
,
indeed
?
<EOS>
and
pray
what
sort
of
guardian
do
you
make
?
<EOS>
do
your
charge
give
you
much
trouble
?
<EOS>
young
lady
of
her
age
,
be
sometimes
a
little
difficult
to
manage
,
and
if
she
have
the
true
Darcy
spirit
,
she
may
like
to
have
her
own
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
she
speak
,
she
observe
him
look
at
her
earnestly
,
and
the
manner
in
which
he
immediately
ask
her
why
she
suppose
Miss
Darcy
likely
to
give
them
any
uneasiness
,
convince
her
that
she
have
somehow
or
other
get
pretty
near
the
truth
.
<EOS>
She
directly
reply
,
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
be
frighten
.
<EOS>
I
never
hear
any
harm
of
her
;
and
I
dare
say
she
be
one
of
the
most
tractable
creature
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
very
great
favourite
with
some
lady
of
my
acquaintance
,
Mrs.
Hurst
and
Miss
Bingley
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
hear
you
say
that
you
know
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
them
a
little
.
<EOS>
Their
brother
be
a
pleasant
gentleman
-
like
man
 
<EOS>
he
be
a
great
friend
of
Darcy
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
"
say
Elizabeth
drily
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Darcy
be
uncommonly
kind
to
Mr.
Bingley
,
and
take
a
prodigious
deal
of
care
of
him

"
  
<EOS>
"
care
of
him
!
 
<EOS>
yes
,
I
really
believe
Darcy
_
<EOS>
do
_
take
care
of
him
in
those
point
where
he
most
want
care
.
<EOS>
from
something
that
he
tell
me
in
our
journey
hither
,
I
have
reason
to
think
Bingley
very
much
indebted
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
I
ought
to
beg
his
pardon
,
for
I
have
no
right
to
suppose
that
Bingley
be
the
person
mean
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
conjecture
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
circumstance
which
Darcy
of
course
would
not
wish
to
be
generally
know
,
because
if
it
be
to
get
round
to
the
lady
's
family
,
it
would
be
an
unpleasant
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
depend
upon
my
not
mention
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
remember
that
I
have
not
much
reason
for
suppose
it
to
be
Bingley
.
<EOS>
what
he
tell
me
be
merely
this
;
that
he
congratulate
himself
on
have
lately
save
a
friend
from
the
inconvenience
of
a
most
imprudent
marriage
,
but
without
mention
name
or
any
other
particular
,
and
I
only
suspect
it
to
be
Bingley
from
believe
him
the
kind
of
young
man
to
get
into
a
scrape
of
that
sort
,
and
from
know
them
to
have
be
together
the
whole
of
last
summer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
Mr.
Darcy
give
you
his
reason
for
this
interference
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
that
there
be
some
very
strong
objection
against
the
lady
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
what
art
do
he
use
to
separate
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
do
not
talk
to
me
of
his
own
art

say
Fitzwilliam
smile
.

"
<EOS>
He
only
tell
me
,
what
I
have
now
tell
you

"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
make
no
answer
,
and
walk
on
,
her
heart
swell
with
indignation
.
<EOS>
after
watch
her
a
little
,
Fitzwilliam
ask
her
why
she

so
thoughtful

I
do
not
see
what
right
Mr.
Darcy
have
to
decide
on
the
propriety
of

's
inclination

why
,
upon
his

he

,
"
she
continue

recollect
herself
,
"
as
we
know
none
of
the
particular

it
be
not
fair
to
condemn
him

It

lessen
the
honour

's
triumph
very
sadly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
speak
jestingly
,
but
it
appear
to
her
so
just
a
picture
of
Mr.
Darcy
,
that
she
would
not
trust
herself
with
an
answer
;
and
,
therefore
,
abruptly
change
the
conversation
,
talk
on
indifferent
matter
till
they
reach
the
parsonage
.
<EOS>
there
,
shut
into
her
own
room
,
as
soon
as
their
visitor
leave
them
,
she
could
think
without
interruption
of
all
that
she
have
hear
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
any
other
people
could
be
mean
than
those
with
whom
she
be
connect
.
<EOS>
there
could
not
exist
in
the
world
_
two
_
man
,
over
whom
Mr.
Darcy
could
have
such
boundless
influence
.
<EOS>
that
he
have
be
concern
in
the
measure
take
to
separate
Mr.
Bingley
and
Jane
,
she
have
never
doubt
;
but
she
have
always
attribute
to
Miss
Bingley
the
principal
design
and
arrangement
of
them
.
<EOS>
if
his
own
vanity
,
however
,
do
not
mislead
him
,
_
he
_
be
the
cause
,
his
pride
and
caprice
be
the
cause
of
all
that
Jane
have
suffer
,
and
still
continue
to
suffer

<EOS>
He
have
ruin
for
a
while
every
hope
of
happiness
for
the
most
affectionate
,
generous
heart
in
the
world
;
and
no

could
say
how
last
an
evil
he
may
have
inflict

<EOS>
"
there
be
some
very
strong
objection
against
the
lady

Colonel
Fitzwilliam

word

these
strong
objection
probably

Mr.

himself

not

respectability
which
he
will
probably
never

"
<EOS>
when
she
think
of
her
mother
indeed
,
her
confidence
give
way
a
little
,
but
she
would
not
allow
that
any
objection
_
there
_
have
material
weight
with
Mr.

whose
pride
,
she
be
convince
,
would
receive
a
deep
wound
from
the
want
of
importance
in
his
friend
's
connection
,
than
from
their
want
of
sense
;
and
she
be
quite
decide
at
last
,
that
he
have
be
partly
govern
by
this
bad
kind
of
pride
,
and
partly
by
the
wish
of
retain
Mr.
Bingley
for
his
sister
.
  
<EOS>
the
agitation
and
tear
which
the
subject
occasion
,
bring
on
a
headache
;
and
it
grow
so
much
bad
towards
the
evening
that
,
add
to
her
unwillingness
to
see
Mr.
Darcy
,
it
determine
her
not
to
attend
her
cousin
to
Rosings
,
where
they
be
engage
to
drink
tea
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Collins
,
see
that
she
be
really
unwell
,
do
not
press
her
to
go
,
and
as
much
as
possible
prevent
her
husband
from
press
her
,
but
Mr.
Collins
could
not
conceal
his
apprehension
of
Lady
Catherine
's
be
rather
displeased
by
her
stay
at
home
.
    
<EOS>
when
they
be
go
,
Elizabeth
,
as
if
intend
to
exasperate
herself
as
much
as
possible
against
Mr.
Darcy
,
choose
for
her
employment
the
examination
of
all
the
letter
which
Jane
have
write
to
her
since
her
be
in
Kent
.
<EOS>
They
contain
no
actual
complaint
,
nor
be
there
any
revival
of
past
occurrence
,
or
any
communication
of
present
suffering
.
<EOS>
but
in
all
,
and
in
almost
every
line
of
each
,
there
be
a
want
of
that
cheerfulness
which
have
be
use
to
characterize
her
style
,
and
which
,
proceed
from
the
serenity
of
a
mind
at
ease
with
itself
,
and
kindly
dispose
towards
every
one
,
have
be
scarcely
ever
cloud
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
notice
every
sentence
convey
the
idea
of
uneasiness
,
with
an
attention
which
it
have
hardly
receive
on
the
first
perusal
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
's
shameful
boast
of
what
misery
he
have
be
able
to
inflict
,
give
her
a
keener
sense
of
her
sister
's
suffering
.
<EOS>
It
be
some
consolation
to
think
that
his
visit
to
Rosings
be
to
end
on
the
day
after
the
next
,
and
a
still
great
,
that
in
less
than
a
fortnight
she
should
herself
be
with
Jane
again
,
and
enable
to
contribute
to
the
recovery
of
her
spirit
,
by
all
that
affection
could
do
.
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
think
of
Darcy
's
leave
Kent
,
without
remember
that
his
cousin
be
to
go
with
him
;
but
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
have
make
it
clear
that
he
have
no
intention
at
all
,
and
agreeable
as
he
be
,
she
do
not
mean
to
be
unhappy
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
while
settle
this
point
,
she
be
suddenly
rouse
by
the
sound
of
the
door
bell
,
and
her
spirit
be
a
little
flutter
by
the
idea
of
its
be
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
himself
,
who
have
once
before
call
late
in
the
evening
,
and
may
now
come
to
enquire
particularly
after
her
.
<EOS>
but
this
idea
be
soon
banish
,
and
her
spirit
be
very
differently
affect
,
when
,
to
her
utter
amazement
,
she
see
Mr.
Darcy
walk
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
in
an
hurried
manner
he
immediately
begin
an
enquiry
after
her
health
,
impute
his
visit
to
a
wish
of
hearing
that
she
be
well
.
<EOS>
She
answer
him
with
cold
civility
.
<EOS>
He
sit
down
for
a
few
moment
,
and
then
get
up
walk
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
surprised
,
but
say
not
a
word
.
<EOS>
after
a
silence
of
several
minute
he
come
towards
her
in
an
agitated
manner
,
and
thus
begin
,
  
"
in
vain
have
I
struggle
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
do
.
<EOS>
My
feeling
will
not
be
repress
.
<EOS>
You
must
allow
me
to
tell
you
how
ardently
I
admire
and
love
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
's
astonishment
be
beyond
expression
.
<EOS>
She
stare
,
coloured
,
doubt
,
and
be
silent
.
<EOS>
this
he
consider
sufficient
encouragement
,
and
the
avowal
of
all
that
he
feel
and
have
long
feel
for
her
,
immediately
follow
.
<EOS>
He
speak
well
,
but
there
be
feeling
besides
those
of
the
heart
to
be
detail
,
and
he
be
not
more
eloquent
on
the
subject
of
tenderness
than
of
pride
.
<EOS>
His
sense
of
her
inferiority
 
of
its
be
a
degradation
 
of
the
family
obstacle
which
judgment
have
always
oppose
to
inclination
,
be
dwell
on
with
a
warmth
which
seem
due
to
the
consequence
he
be
wound
,
but
be
very
unlikely
to
recommend
his
suit
.
  
<EOS>
in
spite
of
her
deeply
-
root
dislike
,
she
could
not
be
insensible
to
the
compliment
of
such
a
man
's
affection
,
and
though
her
intention
do
not
vary
for
an
instant
,
she
be
at
first
sorry
for
the
pain
he
be
to
receive
;
till
,
rouse
to
resentment
by
his
subsequent
language
,
she
lose
all
compassion
in
anger
.
<EOS>
She
try
,
however
,
to
compose
herself
to
answer
him
with
patience
,
when
he
should
have
do
.
<EOS>
He
conclude
with
represent
to
her
the
strength
of
that
attachment
which
,
in
spite
of
all
his
endeavour
,
he
have
find
impossible
to
conquer
;
and
with
express
his
hope
that
it
would
now
be
reward
by
her
acceptance
of
his
hand
.
<EOS>
as
he
say
this
,
she
could
easily
see
that
he
have
no
doubt
of
a
favourable
answer
.
<EOS>
He
_
speak
_
of
apprehension
and
anxiety
,
but
his
countenance
express
real
security
.
<EOS>
such
a
circumstance
could
only
exasperate
farther
,
and
when
he
cease
,
the
colour
rise
into
her
cheek
,
and
she
say
,
  
"
<EOS>
in
such
case
as
this
,
it
be
,
I
believe
,
the
establish
mode
to
express
a
sense
of
obligation
for
the
sentiment
avow
,
however
unequally
they
may
be
return
.
<EOS>
It
be
natural
that
obligation
should
be
feel
,
and
if
I
could
_
feel
_
gratitude
,
I
would
now
thank
you
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
 
I
have
never
desire
your
good
opinion
,
and
you
have
certainly
bestow
it
most
unwillingly
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
have
occasion
pain
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
most
unconsciously
do
,
however
,
and
I
hope
will
be
of
short
duration
.
<EOS>
the
feeling
which
,
you
tell
me
,
have
long
prevent
the
acknowledgment
of
your
regard
,
can
have
little
difficulty
in
overcome
it
after
this
explanation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
,
who
be
lean
against
the
mantle
-
piece
with
his
eye
fix
on
her
face
,
seem
to
catch
her
word
with
no
less
resentment
than
surprise
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
become
pale
with
anger
,
and
the
disturbance
of
his
mind
be
visible
in
every
feature
.
<EOS>
He
be
struggle
for
the
appearance
of
composure
,
and
would
not
open
his
lip
,
till
he
believe
himself
to
have
attain
it
.
<EOS>
the
pause
be
to
Elizabeth
's
feeling
dreadful

<EOS>
at
length
,
in
a
voice
of
force
calmness
,
he
say
,
  
"
<EOS>
and
this
be
all
the
reply

I
be
to
have
the
honour
of
expecting

may
,
perhaps
,
wish
to
be
inform
why
,
with
so
little
_
endeavour

at
civility

I
be
thus
reject

it
be
of
small
importance

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
as
well
enquire
,
"
reply
she
,
"
why
with
so
evident
a
design
of
offend
and
insult
me
,
you
choose
to
tell
me
that
you
like
me
against
your
will
,
against
your
reason
,
and
even
against
your
character
?
<EOS>
be
not
this
some
excuse
for
incivility
,
if
I
_
be
_
uncivil
?
<EOS>
but
I
have
other
provocation

<EOS>
You
know
I
have
.
<EOS>
have
not
my
own
feeling
decide
against
you
,
have
they
be
indifferent

or
have
they
even
be
favourable

do
you
think
that
any
consideration
would
tempt
me
to
accept
the
man
,
who
have
be
the
mean
of
ruin
,
perhaps
for
ever

the
happiness
of
a
most
beloved
sister

<EOS>
as
she
pronounce
these
word
,
Mr.
Darcy
change
colour
;
but
the
emotion
be
short
,

he
listen
without

continue

I
have
every

no

ungenerous
part

You
dare
not

you
can
not

<EOS>
She
pause
,
and
see
with
no
slight
indignation
that
he
be
listen
with
an
air
which
prove
him
wholly
unmoved
by
any
feeling
of
remorse

He
even
look
at
her
with
a
smile
of
affected
incredulity

<EOS>
"
Can
you
deny
that

it

"
she
repeat
.
  
<EOS>
with
assumed
tranquillity
he
then
reply
,
"
I
have
no
wish

deny
that
I
do
every
thing

my

separate

<EOS>
Elizabeth
disdain
the
appearance
of
notice
this
civil
reflection
,
but
its
meaning
do
not
escape
,
nor
be
it
likely
to
conciliate
her

Your

month

on

you
have
to

in

imaginary
act

you
here
defend
yourself

misrepresentation

can
you
here
impose
upon

?
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
You
take
an
eager
interest
in
that
gentleman
's
concern

say
Darcy
in
a
less
tranquil
tone
,
and
with
a
heightened
colour

<EOS>

who
that
know
what
his
misfortune
have

His
misfortune

repeat
Darcy
contemptuously
;
"
yes

his
misfortune
have
be
great
indeed

"
<EOS>
and
of
your
infliction
,
"
cry
Elizabeth
with
energy
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
reduce
him
to
his
present
state

poverty

comparative
poverty

You
have
withhold
the
advantage

which
you
must
know

You
have
deprive
the
good
year
of
his
life

independence

be
no

his
due

his
desert

You
have
do

the
mention

contempt

ridicule

in

offence
may
have

not
your
pride

hurt

my
honest
confession

scruple

have
long

inclination
;
by
reason
,
by
reflection
,
by
every
thing
.
<EOS>
but
disguise
of
every
sort
be
my
abhorrence
.
<EOS>
nor
be
I
ashamed
of
the
feeling
I
relate
.
<EOS>
They
be
natural
and
just
.
<EOS>
Could
you
expect
me
to
rejoice
in
the
inferiority
of
your
connection
?
<EOS>
to
congratulate
myself
on
the
hope
of
relation
,
whose
condition
in
life
be
so
decidedly
beneath
my
own
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
feel
herself
grow
more
angry
every
moment
;
yet
she
try
to
the
utmost
to
speak
with
composure
when
she
say
,
  
"
You
be
mistaken
,
Mr.
Darcy
,
if
you
suppose
that
the
mode
of
your
declaration
affect
me
in
any
other
way
,
than
as
it
spare
me
the
concern
which
I
may
have
feel
in
refuse
you
,
have
you
behave
in
a
more
gentleman
-
like
manner
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
see
him
start
at
this
,
but
he
say
nothing
,
and
she
continue
,
  
"
You
could
not
have
make
me
the
offer
of
your
hand
in
any
possible
way
that
would
have
tempt
me
to
accept
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
again
his
astonishment
be
obvious
;
and
he
look
at
her
with
an
expression
of
mingled
incredulity
and
mortification
.
<EOS>
She
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
from
the
very
beginning
,
from
the
first
moment
I
may
almost
say
,
of
my
acquaintance
with
you
,
your
manner
impress
me
with
the
full
belief
of
your
arrogance
,
your
conceit
,
and
your
selfish
disdain
of
the
feeling
of
other
,
be
such
as
to
form
that
ground
-
work
of
disapprobation
,
on
which
succeed
event
have
build
so
immoveable
a
dislike
;
and
I
have
not
know
you
<EOS>
a
month
before
I
feel
that
you
be
the
last
man
in
the
world
whom
I
could
ever
be
prevail
on
to
marry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
say
quite
enough
,
madam
.
<EOS>
I
perfectly
comprehend
your
feeling
,
and
have
now
only
to
be
ashamed
of
what
my
own
have
be
.
<EOS>
forgive
me
for
have
take
up
so
much
of
your
time
,
and
accept
my
good
wish
for
your
health
and
happiness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
with
these
word
he
hastily
leave
the
room
,
and
Elizabeth
hear
him
the
next
moment
open
the
front
door
and
quit
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
tumult
of
her
mind
be
now
painfully
great
.
<EOS>
She
know
not
how
to
support
herself
,
and
from
actual
weakness
sit
down
and
cry
for
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
Her
astonishment
,
as
she
reflect
on
what
have
pass
,
be
increase
by
every
review
of
it
.
<EOS>
that
she
should
receive
an
offer
of
marriage
from
Mr.
Darcy
!
<EOS>
that
he
should
have
be
in
love
with
her
for
so
many
month
!
<EOS>
so
much
in
love
as
to
wish
to
marry
her
in
spite
of
all
the
objection
which
have
make
him
prevent
his
friend
's
marry
her
sister
,
and
which
must
appear
at
least
with
equal
force
in
his
own
case
,
be
almost
incredible
!
<EOS>
it
be
gratify
to
have
inspire
unconsciously
so
strong
an
affection
.
<EOS>
but
his
pride
,
his
abominable
pride
,
his
shameless
avowal
of
what
he
have
do
with
respect
to
Jane
,
his
unpardonable
assurance
in
acknowledge
,
though
he
could
not
justify
it
,
and
the
unfeele
manner
in
which
he
have
mention
Mr.
Wickham
,
his
cruelty
towards
whom
he
have
not
attempt
to
deny
,
soon
overcome
the
pity
which
the
consideration
of
his
attachment
have
for
a
moment
excited
.
  
<EOS>
She
continue
in
very
agitate
reflection
till
the
sound
of
Lady
Catherine
's
carriage
make
her
feel
how
unequal
she
be
to
encounter
Charlotte
's
observation
,
and
hurry
her
away
to
her
room
.
    
<EOS>
Elizabeth
awake
the
next
morning
to
the
same
thought
and
meditation
which
have
at
length
close
her
eye
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
yet
recover
from
the
surprise
of
what
have
happen
;
it
be
impossible
to
think
of
any
thing
else
,
and
totally
indispose
for
employment
,
she
resolve
soon
after
breakfast
to
indulge
herself
in
air
and
exercise
.
<EOS>
She
be
proceed
directly
to
her
favourite
walk
,
when
the
recollection
of
Mr.
Darcy
's
sometimes
come
there
stop
her
,
and
instead
of
enter
the
park
,
she
turn
up
the
lane
,
which
lead
her
farther
from
the
turnpike
road
.
<EOS>
the
park
paling
be
still
the
boundary
on
one
side
,
and
she
soon
pass
one
of
the
gate
into
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
after
walk
two
or
three
time
along
that
part
of
the
lane
,
she
be
tempt
,
by
the
pleasantness
of
the
morning
,
to
stop
at
the
gate
and
look
into
the
park
.
<EOS>
the
five
week
which
she
have
now
pass
in
Kent
,
have
make
a
great
difference
in
the
country
,
and
every
day
be
add
to
the
verdure
of
the
early
tree
.
<EOS>
She
be
on
the
point
of
continue
her
walk
,
when
she
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
gentleman
within
the
sort
of
grove
which
edge
the
park
;
he
be
move
that
way
;
and
fearful
of
its
be
Mr.
Darcy
,
she
be
directly
retreat
.
<EOS>
but
the
person
who
advance
,
be
now
near
enough
to
see
her
,
and
step
forward
with
eagerness
,
pronounce
her
name
.
<EOS>
She
have
turn
away
,
but
on
hear
herself
call
,
though
in
a
voice
which
prove
it
to
be
Mr.
Darcy
,
she
move
again
towards
the
gate
.
<EOS>
He
have
by
that
time
reach
it
also
,
and
hold
out
a
letter
,
which
she
instinctively
take
,
say
with
a
look
of
haughty
composure
,
"
I
have
be
walk
in
the
grove
some
time
in
the
hope
of
meet
you
.
<EOS>
Will
you
do
me
the
honour
of
read
that
letter
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
with
a
slight
bow
,
turn
again
into
the
plantation
,
and
be
soon
out
of
sight
.
  
<EOS>
with
no
expectation
of
pleasure
,
but
with
the
strong
curiosity
,
Elizabeth
open
the
letter
,
and
to
her
still
increase
wonder
,
perceive
an
envelope
contain
two
sheet
of
letter
paper
,
write
quite
through
,
in
a
very
close
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
envelope
itself
be
likewise
full
.
 
<EOS>
pursue
her
way
along
the
lane
,
she
then
begin
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
date
from
rosing
,
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
be
as
follow
:
    
"
be
not
alarm
,
Madam
,
on
receive
this
letter
,
by
the
apprehension
of
its
contain
any
repetition
of
those
sentiment
,
or
renewal
of
those
offer
,
which
be
last
night
so
disgusting
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
write
without
any
intention
of
pain
you
,
or
humble
myself
,
by
dwell
on
wish
,
which
,
for
the
happiness
of
both
,
can
not
be
too
soon
forget
;
and
the
effort
which
the
formation
,
and
the
perusal
of
this
letter
must
occasion
,
should
have
be
spare
,
have
not
my
character
require
it
to
be
write
and
read
.
<EOS>
You
must
,
therefore
,
pardon
the
freedom
with
which
I
demand
your
attention
;
your
feeling
,
I
know
,
will
bestow
it
unwillingly
,
but
I
demand
it
of
your
justice
.
  
<EOS>
"
two
offence
of
a
very
different
nature
,
and
by
no
means
of
equal
magnitude
,
you
last
night
lay
to
my
charge
.
<EOS>
the
first
mention
be
,
that
,
regardless
of
the
sentiment
of
either
,
I
have
detach
Mr.
Bingley
from
your
sister
,
 
and
the
other
,
that
I
have
,
in
defiance
of
various
claim
,
in
defiance
of
honour
and
humanity
,
ruin
the
immediate
prosperity
,
and
blast
the
prospect
of
Mr.
Wickham
.
 
<EOS>
wilfully
and
wantonly
to
have
throw
off
the
companion
of
my
youth
,
the
acknowledge
favourite
of
my
father
,
a
young
man
who
have
scarcely
any
other
dependence
than
on
our
patronage
,
and
who
have
be
bring
up
to
expect
its
exertion
,
would
be
a
depravity
,
to
which
the
separation
of
two
young
person
,
whose
affection
could
be
the
growth
of
only
a
few
week
,
could
bear
no
comparison
.
 
<EOS>
but
from
the
severity
of
that
blame
which
be
last
night
so
liberally
bestow
,
respect
each
circumstance
,
I
shall
hope
to
be
in
future
secure
,
when
the
follow
account
of
my
action
and
their
motive
have
be
read
.
 
<EOS>
if
,
in
the
explanation
of
them
which
be
due
to
myself
,
I
be
under
the
necessity
of
relate
feeling
which
may
be
offensive
to
your
's
,
I
can
only
say
that
I
be
sorry
.
 
<EOS>
the
necessity
must
be
obey
 
and
farther
apology
would
be
absurd
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
be
long
in
Hertfordshire
,
before
I
see
,
in
common
with
other
,
that
Bingley
prefer
your
eld
sister
,
to
any
other
young
woman
in
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
till
the
evening
of
the
dance
at
Netherfield
that
I
have
any
apprehension
of
his
feel
a
serious
attachment
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
see
him
in
love
before
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
ball
,
while
I
have
the
honour
of
dance
with
you
,
I
be
first
make
acquaint
,
by
Sir
William
Lucas
's
accidental
information
,
that
Bingley
's
attention
to
your
sister
have
give
rise
to
a
general
expectation
of
their
marriage
.
<EOS>
He
speak
of
it
as
a
certain
event
,
of
which
the
time
alone
could
be
undecided
.
<EOS>
from
that
moment
I
observe
my
friend
's
behaviour
attentively
;
and
I
could
then
perceive
that
his
partiality
for
Miss
Bennet
be
beyond
what
I
have
ever
witness
in
him
.
<EOS>
Your
sister
I
also
watch
.
 
<EOS>
Her
look
and
manner
be
open
,
cheerful
and
engaging
as
ever
,
but
without
any
symptom
of
peculiar
regard
,
and
I
remain
convinced
from
the
evening
's
scrutiny
,
that
though
she
receive
his
attention
with
pleasure
,
she
do
not
invite
them
by
any
participation
of
sentiment
.
 
<EOS>
if
_
<EOS>
you
_
have
not
be
mistake
here
,
_
I
_
must
have
be
in
an
error
.
<EOS>
Your
superior
knowledge
of
your
sister
must
make
the
latter
probable
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
be
so
,
if
I
have
be
mislead
by
such
error
,
to
inflict
pain
on
her
,
your
resentment
have
not
be
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
but
I
shall
not
scruple
to
assert
,
that
the
serenity
of
your
sister
's
countenance
and
air
be
such
,
as
may
have
give
the
most
acute
observer
,
a
conviction
that
,
however
amiable
her
temper
,
her
heart
be
not
likely
to
be
easily
touch
.
 
<EOS>
that
I
be
desirous
of
believe
her
indifferent
<EOS>
be
certain
,
 
but
I
will
venture
to
say
that
my
investigation
and
decision
be
not
usually
influence
by
my
hope
or
fear
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
her
to
be
indifferent
because
I
wish
it
;
 
I
believe
it
on
impartial
conviction
,
as
truly
as
I
wish
it
in
reason
.
 
<EOS>
My
objection
to
the
marriage
be
not
merely
those
,
which
I
last
night
acknowledge
to
have
require
the
utmost
force
of
passion
to
put
aside
,
in
my
own
case
;
the
want
of
connection
could
not
be
so
great
an
evil
to
my
friend
as
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
other
cause
of
repugnance
;
 
cause
which
,
though
still
exist
,
and
exist
to
an
equal
degree
in
both
instance
<EOS>
,
I
have
myself
endeavour
to
forget
,
because
they
be
not
immediately
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
these
cause
must
be
state
,
though
briefly
.
 
<EOS>
the
situation
of
your
mother
's
family
,
though
objectionable
,
be
nothing
in
comparison
of
that
total
want
of
propriety
so
frequently
,
so
almost
uniformly
betray
by
herself
,
by
your
three
young
sister
,
and
occasionally
even
by
your
father
.
 
<EOS>
pardon
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
pain
me
to
offend
you
.
<EOS>
but
amidst
your
concern
for
the
defect
of
your
near
relation
,
and
your
displeasure
at
this
representation
of
them
,
let
it
give
you
consolation
to
consider
that
,
to
have
conduct
yourself
so
as
to
avoid
any
share
of
the
like
censure
,
be
praise
no
less
generally
bestow
on
you
and
your
eld
sister
,
than
it
be
honourable
to
the
sense
and
disposition
of
both
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
only
say
farther
,
that
from
what
pass
that
evening
,
my
opinion
of
all
party
be
confirm
,
and
every
inducement
heighten
,
which
could
have
lead
me
before
,
to
preserve
my
friend
from
what
I
esteem
a
most
unhappy
connection
.
 
<EOS>
He
leave
Netherfield
for
London
,
on
the
day
follow
,
as
you
,
I
be
certain
,
remember
,
with
the
design
of
soon
return
.
 
<EOS>
the
part
which
I
act
,
be
now
to
be
explain
.
 
<EOS>
His
sister
'
uneasiness
have
be
equally
excited
with
my
own
;
our
coincidence
of
feeling
be
soon
discover
;
and
,
alike
sensible
that
no
time
be
to
be
lose
in
detach
their
brother
<EOS>
,
we
shortly
resolve
on
join
him
directly
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
We
accordingly
go
 
and
there
I
readily
engage
in
the
office
of
point
out
to
my
friend
,
the
certain
evil
of
such
a
choice
.
 
<EOS>
I
describe
,
and
enforce
them
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
however
this
remonstrance
may
have
stagger
or
delay
his
determination
,
I
do
not
suppose
that
it
would
ultimately
have
prevent
the
marriage
,
have
it
not
be
second
by
the
assurance
which
I
hesitate
not
in
giving
,
of
your
sister
's
indifference
.
<EOS>
He
have
before
believe
her
to
return
his
affection
with
sincere
,
if
not
with
equal
regard
.
 
<EOS>
but
Bingley
have
great
natural
modesty
,
with
a
strong
dependence
on
my
judgment
than
on
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
to
convince
him
,
therefore
,
that
he
have
deceive
himself
,
be
no
very
difficult
point
.
<EOS>
to
persuade
him
against
return
into
Hertfordshire
,
when
that
conviction
have
be
give
,
be
scarcely
the
work
of
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
blame
myself
for
have
do
thus
much
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
part
of
my
conduct
in
the
whole
affair
,
on
which
I
do
not
reflect
with
satisfaction
;
it
be
that
I
condescend
to
adopt
the
measure
of
art
so
far
as
to
conceal
from
him
your
sister
's
be
in
town
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
myself
,
as
it
be
know
to
Miss
Bingley
,
but
her
brother
be
even
yet
ignorant
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
that
they
may
have
meet
without
ill
consequence
,
be
perhaps
probable
;
 
but
his
regard
do
not
appear
to
me
enough
extinguish
for
him
to
see
her
without
some
danger
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
this
concealment
,
this
disguise
,
be
beneath
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
do
,
however
,
and
it
be
do
for
the
good
.
 
<EOS>
on
this
subject
I
have
nothing
more
to
say
,
no
other
apology
to
offer
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
wound
your
sister
's
feeling
,
it
be
unknowingly
do
;
and
though
the
motive
which
govern
me
may
to
<EOS>
you
very
naturally
appear
insufficient
,
I
have
not
yet
learn
to
condemn
them
.
 
<EOS>
with
respect
to
that
other
,
more
weighty
accusation
,
of
have
injure
Mr.
Wickham
,
I
can
only
refute
it
by
lay
before
you
the
whole
of
his
connection
with
my
family
.
<EOS>
of
what
he
have
_
particularly
_
accuse
me
I
be
ignorant
;
but
of
the
truth
of
what
I
shall
relate
,
I
can
summon
more
than
one
witness
of
undoubted
veracity
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wickham
be
the
son
of
a
very
respectable
man
,
who
have
for
many
year
the
management
of
all
the
Pemberley
estate
;
and
whose
good
conduct
in
the
discharge
of
his
trust
,
naturally
incline
my
father
to
be
of
service
to
him
,
and
on
George
Wickham
,
who
be
his
god
-
son
,
his
kindness
be
therefore
liberally
bestow
.
<EOS>
My
father
support
him
at
school
,
and
afterwards
at
Cambridge
;
 
most
important
assistance
,
as
his
own
father
,
always
poor
from
the
extravagance
of
his
wife
,
would
have
be
unable
to
give
him
a
gentleman
's
education
.
<EOS>
My
father
be
not
only
fond
of
this
young
man
's
society
,
whose
manner
be
always
engage
;
he
have
also
the
high
opinion
of
him
,
and
hope
the
church
would
be
his
profession
,
intend
to
provide
for
him
in
it
.
<EOS>
as
for
myself
,
it
be
many
,
<EOS>
many
year
since
I
first
begin
to
think
of
him
in
a
very
different
manner
.
<EOS>
the
vicious
propensity
 
the
want
of
principle
which
he
be
careful
to
guard
from
the
knowledge
of
his
good
friend
,
could
not
escape
the
observation
of
a
young
man
of
nearly
the
same
age
with
himself
,
and
who
have
opportunity
of
see
him
in
unguarded
moment
,
which
Mr.
Darcy
could
not
have
.
<EOS>
here
again
I
shall
give
you
pain
 
to
what
degree
you
only
can
tell
.
<EOS>
but
whatever
may
be
the
sentiment
which
Mr.
Wickham
have
create
,
a
suspicion
of
their
nature
shall
not
prevent
me
from
unfold
his
real
character
.
<EOS>
It
add
even
another
motive
.
<EOS>
My
excellent
father
die
about
five
year
ago
;
and
his
attachment
to
Mr.
Wickham
be
to
the
last
so
steady
,
that
in
his
will
he
particularly
recommend
it
to
me
,
to
promote
his
advancement
in
the
good
manner
that
his
profession
may
allow
,
and
if
he
take
order
,
desire
that
a
valuable
family
living
may
be
his
as
soon
as
soon
as
it
become
vacant
.
<EOS>
there
be
also
a
legacy
of
one
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
His
own
father
do
not
long
survive
mine
,
and
within
half
a
year
from
these
event
,
Mr.
Wickham
write
to
inform
me
that
,
have
finally
resolve
against
take
order
,
he
hope
I
should
not
think
it
unreasonable
for
him
to
expect
some
more
immediate
pecuniary
advantage
,
in
lieu
of
the
preferment
,
by
which
he
could
not
be
benefit
.
<EOS>
He
have
some
intention
,
he
add
,
of
study
the
law
,
and
I
must
be
aware
that
the
interest
of
one
thousand
pound
would
be
a
very
insufficient
support
therein
.
<EOS>
I
rather
wish
,
than
believe
him
to
be
sincere
;
but
at
any
rate
,
be
perfectly
ready
to
accede
to
his
proposal
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
Mr.
Wickham
ought
not
to
be
a
clergyman
.
<EOS>
the
business
be
therefore
soon
settle
.
<EOS>
He
resign
all
claim
to
assistance
in
the
church
,
be
it
possible
that
he
could
ever
be
in
a
situation
to
receive
it
,
and
accept
in
return
three
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
all
connection
between
us
seem
now
dissolve
.
<EOS>
I
think
too
ill
of
him
,
to
invite
him
to
Pemberley
,
or
admit
his
society
in
town
.
<EOS>
in
town
I
believe
he
chiefly
live
,
but
his
study
the
law
be
a
mere
pretence
,
and
be
now
free
from
all
restraint
,
his
life
be
a
life
of
idleness
and
dissipation
.
<EOS>
for
about
three
year
I
hear
little
of
him
;
but
on
the
decease
of
the
incumbent
of
the
living
which
have
be
design
for
him
,
he
apply
to
me
again
by
letter
for
the
presentation
.
<EOS>
His
circumstance
,
he
assure
me
,
and
I
have
no
difficulty
in
believe
it
,
be
exceedingly
bad
.
<EOS>
He
have
find
the
law
a
most
unprofitable
study
,
and
be
now
absolutely
resolve
on
be
ordain
,
if
I
would
present
him
to
the
living
in
question
 
of
which
he
trust
there
could
be
little
doubt
,
as
he
be
well
assure
that
I
have
no
other
person
to
provide
for
,
and
I
could
not
have
forget
my
revere
father
's
intention
.
<EOS>
You
will
hardly
blame
me
for
refuse
to
comply
with
this
entreaty
,
or
for
resist
every
repetition
of
it
.
<EOS>
His
resentment
be
in
proportion
to
the
distress
of
his
circumstance
 
and
he
be
doubtless
as
violent
in
his
abuse
of
me
to
other
,
as
in
his
reproach
to
myself
.
<EOS>
after
this
period
,
every
appearance
of
acquaintance
be
dropt
.
<EOS>
how
he
live
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
but
last
summer
he
be
again
most
painfully
obtrude
on
my
notice
.
<EOS>
I
must
now
mention
a
circumstance
which
I
would
wish
to
forget
myself
,
and
which
no
obligation
less
than
the
present
should
induce
me
to
unfold
to
any
human
being
.
<EOS>
have
say
thus
much
,
I
feel
no
doubt
of
your
secrecy
.
<EOS>
My
sister
,
who
be
more
than
ten
year
my
junior
,
be
leave
to
the
guardianship
of
my
mother
's
nephew
,
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
,
and
myself
.
<EOS>
about
a
year
ago
,
she
be
take
from
school
,
and
an
establishment
form
for
her
in
London
;
and
last
summer
she
go
with
the
lady
who
preside
over
it
,
to
ramsgate
;
and
thither
also
go
Mr.
Wickham
,
undoubtedly
by
design
;
for
there
prove
to
have
be
a
prior
acquaintance
between
him
and
Mrs.
Younge
,
in
whose
character
we
be
most
unhappily
deceive
;
and
by
her
connivance
and
aid
,
he
so
far
recommend
himself
to
Georgiana
,
whose
affectionate
heart
retain
a
strong
impression
of
his
kindness
to
her
as
a
child
,
that
she
be
persuade
to
believe
herself
in
love
,
and
to
consent
to
an
elopement
.
<EOS>
She
be
then
but
fifteen
,
which
must
be
her
excuse
;
and
after
state
her
imprudence
,
I
be
happy
to
add
,
that
I
owe
the
knowledge
of
it
to
herself
.
<EOS>
I
join
them
unexpectedly
a
day
or
two
before
the
intend
elopement
,
and
then
Georgiana
,
unable
to
support
the
idea
of
grieve
and
offend
a
brother
whom
she
almost
look
up
to
as
a
father
,
acknowledge
the
whole
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
may
imagine
what
I
feel
and
how
I
act
.
<EOS>
regard
for
my
sister
's
credit
and
feeling
prevent
any
public
exposure
,
but
I
write
to
Mr.
Wickham
,
who
leave
the
place
immediately
,
and
Mrs.
Younge
be
of
course
remove
from
her
charge
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wickham
's
chief
object
be
unquestionably
my
sister
's
fortune
,
which
be
thirty
thousand
pound
;
but
I
can
not
help
suppose
that
the
hope
of
revenge
himself
on
me
,
be
a
strong
inducement
.
<EOS>
His
revenge
would
have
be
complete
indeed
.
<EOS>
this
,
madam
,
be
a
faithful
narrative
of
every
event
in
which
we
have
be
concern
together
;
and
if
you
do
not
absolutely
reject
it
as
false
,
you
will
,
I
hope
,
acquit
me
henceforth
of
cruelty
towards
Mr.
Wickham
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
in
what
manner
,
under
what
form
of
falsehood
he
have
impose
on
you
;
but
his
success
be
not
perhaps
to
be
wonder
at
.
<EOS>
ignorant
as
you
previously
be
of
every
thing
concern
either
,
detection
could
not
be
in
your
power
,
and
suspicion
certainly
not
in
your
inclination
.
<EOS>
You
may
possibly
wonder
why
all
this
be
not
tell
you
last
night
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
then
master
enough
of
myself
to
know
what
could
or
ought
to
be
reveal
.
<EOS>
for
the
truth
of
every
thing
here
relate
,
I
can
appeal
more
particularly
to
the
testimony
of
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
,
who
from
our
near
relationship
and
constant
intimacy
,
and
still
more
as
one
of
the
executor
of
my
father
's
will
,
have
be
unavoidably
acquaint
with
every
particular
of
these
transaction
.
<EOS>
if
your
abhorrence
of
_
me
_
should
make
_
my
_
assertion
valueless
,
you
can
not
be
prevent
by
the
same
cause
from
confide
in
my
cousin
;
and
that
there
may
be
the
possibility
of
consult
him
<EOS>
,
I
shall
endeavour
to
find
some
opportunity
of
put
this
letter
in
your
hand
in
the
course
of
the
morning
.
<EOS>
I
will
only
add
,
God
bless
you
.

"
FITZWILLIAM
DARCY

<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
if
Elizabeth
,
when
Mr.
Darcy
give
her
the
letter
,
do
not
expect
it
to
contain
a
renewal
of
his
offer
,
she
have
form
no
expectation
at
all
of
its
content
.
<EOS>
but
such
as
they
be
,
it
may
be
well
suppose
how
eagerly
she
go
through
them
,
and
what
a
contrariety
of
emotion
they
excite
.
<EOS>
Her
feeling
as
she
read
be
scarcely
to
be
define
.
<EOS>
with
amazement
do
she
first
understand
that
he
believe
any
apology
to
be
in
his
power
;
and
steadfastly
be
she
persuade
that
he
could
have
no
explanation
to
give
,
which
a
just
sense
of
shame
would
not
conceal
.
<EOS>
with
a
strong
prejudice
against
every
thing
he
may
say
,
she
begin
his
account
of
what
have
happen
at
Netherfield
.
<EOS>
She
read
,
with
an
eagerness
which
hardly
leave
her
power
of
comprehension
,
and
from
impatience
of
know
what
the
next
sentence
may
bring
,
be
incapable
of
attend
to
the
sense
of
the
one
before
her
eye
.
<EOS>
His
belief
of
her
sister
's
insensibility
,
she
instantly
resolve
to
be
false
,
and
his
account
of
the
real
,
the
bad
objection
to
the
match
,
make
her
too
angry
to
have
any
wish
of
do
him
justice
.
<EOS>
He
express
no
regret
for
what
he
have
do
which
satisfy
her
;
his
style
be
not
penitent
,
but
haughty
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
pride
and
insolence
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
this
subject
be
succeed
by
his
account
of
Mr.
Wickham
,
when
she
read
with
somewhat
clear
attention
,
a
relation
of
event
,
which
,
if
true
,
must
overthrow
every
cherished
opinion
of
his
worth
,
and
which
bear
so
alarm
an
affinity
to
his
own
history
of
himself
,
her
feeling
be
yet
more
acutely
painful
and
more
difficult
of
definition
.
<EOS>
astonishment
,
apprehension
,
and
even
horror
,
oppress
her
.
<EOS>
She
wish
to
discredit
it
entirely
,
repeatedly
exclaim
,
"
this
must
be
false
!
<EOS>
this
can
not
be
!
<EOS>
this
must
be
the
gross
falsehood
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
when
she
have
go
through
the
whole
letter
,
though
scarcely
know
any
thing
of
the
last
page
or
two
,
put
it
hastily
away
,
protest
that
she
would
not
regard
it
,
that
she
would
never
look
in
it
again
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
perturbed
state
of
mind
,
with
thought
that
could
rest
on
nothing
,
she
walk
on
;
but
it
would
not
do
;
in
half
a
minute
the
letter
be
unfold
again
,
and
collect
herself
as
well
as
she
could
,
she
again
begin
the
mortifying
perusal
of
all
that
relate
to
Wickham
,
and
command
herself
so
far
as
to
examine
the
meaning
of
every
sentence
.
<EOS>
the
account
of
his
connection
with
the
Pemberley
family
,
be
exactly
what
he
have
relate
himself
;
and
the
kindness
of
the
late
Mr.
Darcy
,
though
she
have
not
before
know
its
extent
,
agree
equally
well
with
his
own
word
.
<EOS>
so
far
each
recital
confirm
the
other
:
but
when
she
come
to
the
will
,
the
difference
be
great
.
<EOS>
what
Wickham
have
say
of
the
living
be
fresh
in
her
memory
,
and
as
she
recall
his
very
word
,
it
be
impossible
not
to
feel
that
there
be
gross
duplicity
on
one
side
or
the
other
;
and
,
for
a
few
moment
,
she
flatter
herself
that
her
wish
do
not
err
.
<EOS>
but
when
she
read
,
and
re
-
read
with
the
close
attention
,
the
particular
immediately
follow
of
Wickham
's
resign
all
pretension
to
the
living
,
of
his
receiving
in
lieu
,
so
considerable
a
sum
as
three
thousand
pound
,
again
be
she
force
to
hesitate
.
<EOS>
She
put
down
the
letter
,
weigh
every
circumstance
with
what
she
mean
to
be
impartiality
 
deliberate
on
the
probability
of
each
statement
 
but
with
little
success
.
<EOS>
on
both
side
it
be
only
assertion
.
<EOS>
again
she
read
on
.
<EOS>
but
every
line
prove
more
clearly
that
the
affair
,
which
she
have
believe
it
impossible
that
any
contrivance
could
so
represent
,
as
to
render
Mr.
Darcy
's
conduct
in
it
less
than
infamous
,
be
capable
of
a
turn
which
must
make
him
entirely
blameless
throughout
the
whole
.
  
<EOS>
the
extravagance
and
general
profligacy
which
he
scruple
not
to
lay
to
Mr.
Wickham
's
charge
,
exceedingly
shock
her
;
the
more
so
,
as
she
could
bring
no
proof
of
its
injustice
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
hear
of
him
before
his
entrance
into
the
shire
Militia
,
in
which
he
have
engage
at
the
persuasion
of
the
young
man
,
who
,
on
meet
him
accidentally
in
town
,
have
there
renew
a
slight
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
of
his
former
way
of
life
,
nothing
have
be
know
in
Hertfordshire
but
what
he
tell
himself
.
<EOS>
as
to
his
real
character
,
have
information
be
in
her
power
,
she
have
never
feel
a
wish
of
enquiring
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
,
voice
,
and
manner
,
have
establish
him
at
once
in
the
possession
of
every
virtue
.
<EOS>
She
try
to
recollect
some
instance
of
goodness
,
some
distinguished
trait
of
integrity
or
benevolence
,
that
may
rescue
him
from
the
attack
of
Mr.
Darcy
;
or
at
least
,
by
the
predominance
of
virtue
,
atone
for
those
casual
error
,
under
which
she
would
endeavour
to
class
,
what
Mr.
Darcy
have
describe
as
the
idleness
and
vice
of
many
year
continuance
.
<EOS>
but
no
such
recollection
befriend
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
see
him
instantly
before
her
,
in
every
charm
of
air
and
address
;
but
she
could
remember
no
more
substantial
good
than
the
general
approbation
of
the
neighbourhood
,
and
the
regard
which
his
social
power
have
gain
him
in
the
mess
.
<EOS>
after
pause
on
this
point
a
considerable
while
,
she
once
more
continue
to
read
.
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
the
story
which
follow
of
his
design
on
Miss
Darcy
,
receive
some
confirmation
from
what
have
pass
between
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
and
herself
only
the
morning
before
;
and
at
last
she
be
refer
for
the
truth
of
every
particular
to
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
himself
 
from
whom
she
have
previously
receive
the
information
of
his
near
concern
in
all
his
cousin
's
affair
,
and
whose
character
she
have
no
reason
to
question
.
<EOS>
at
one
time
she
have
almost
resolve
on
apply
to
him
,
but
the
idea
be
check
by
the
awkwardness
of
the
application
,
and
at
length
wholly
banish
by
the
conviction
that
Mr.
Darcy
would
never
have
hazard
such
a
proposal
,
if
he
have
not
be
well
assure
of
his
cousin
's
corroboration
.
  
<EOS>
She
perfectly
remember
every
thing
that
have
pass
in
conversation
between
Wickham
and
herself
,
in
their
first
evening
at
Mr.
Philips
's
.
<EOS>
many
of
his
expression
be
still
fresh
in
her
memory
.
<EOS>
She
be
_
<EOS>
now
_
strike
with
the
impropriety
of
such
communication
to
a
stranger
,
and
wonder
it
have
escape
her
before
.
<EOS>
She
see
the
indelicacy
of
put
himself
forward
as
he
have
do
,
and
the
inconsistency
of
his
profession
with
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
She
remember
that
he
have
boast
of
have
no
fear
of
see
Mr.
Darcy
 
that
Mr.
Darcy
may
leave
the
country
,
but
that
_
he
_
should
stand
his
ground
;
yet
he
have
avoid
the
Netherfield
ball
the
very
next
week
.
<EOS>
She
remember
also
,
that
till
the
Netherfield
family
have
quit
the
country
,
he
have
tell
his
story
to
no
one
but
herself
;
but
that
after
their
removal
,
it
have
be
every
where
discuss
;
that
he
have
then
no
reserve
,
no
scruple
in
sink
Mr.
Darcy
's
character
,
though
he
have
assure
her
that
respect
for
the
father
,
would
always
prevent
his
expose
the
son
.
  
<EOS>
how
differently
do
every
thing
now
appear
in
which
he
be
concerned
!
<EOS>
His
attention
to
Miss
King
be
now
the
consequence
of
view
solely
and
hatefully
mercenary
;
and
the
mediocrity
of
her
fortune
prove
no
longer
the
moderation
of
his
wish
,
but
his
eagerness
to
grasp
at
any
thing
.
<EOS>
His
behaviour
to
herself
could
now
have
have
no
tolerable
motive
;
he
have
either
be
deceive
with
regard
to
her
fortune
,
or
have
be
gratify
his
vanity
by
encourage
the
preference
which
she
believe
she
have
most
incautiously
shew
.
<EOS>
every
linger
struggle
in
his
favour
grow
fainter
and
fainter
;
and
in
farth
justification
of
Mr.
Darcy
,
she
could
not
but
allow
that
Mr.
Bingley
,
when
question
by
Jane
,
have
long
ago
assert
his
blamelessness
in
the
affair
;
that
proud
and
repulsive
as
be
his
manner
,
she
have
never
,
in
the
whole
course
of
their
acquaintance
,
an
acquaintance
which
have
latterly
bring
them
much
together
,
and
give
her
a
sort
of
intimacy
with
his
way
,
see
any
thing
that
betray
him
to
be
unprincipled
or
unjust
 
any
thing
that
speak
him
of
irreligious
or
immoral
habit
.
<EOS>
that
among
his
own
connection
he
be
esteem
and
value
 
that
even
Wickham
have
allow
him
merit
as
a
brother
,
and
that
she
have
often
hear
him
speak
so
affectionately
of
his
sister
as
to
prove
him
capable
of
_
<EOS>
some
_
amiable
feeling
.
<EOS>
that
have
his
action
be
what
Wickham
represent
them
,
so
gross
a
violation
of
every
thing
right
could
hardly
have
be
conceal
from
the
world
;
and
that
friendship
between
a
person
capable
of
it
,
and
such
an
amiable
man
as
Mr.
Bingley
,
be
incomprehensible
.
  
<EOS>
She
grow
absolutely
ashamed
of
herself
.
 
<EOS>
of
neither
Darcy
nor
Wickham
<EOS>
could
she
think
,
without
feel
that
she
have
be
blind
,
partial
,
prejudiced
,
absurd
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
despicably
have
I
act
!
<EOS>
"
she
cry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
,
who
have
pride
myself
on
my
discernment
!
 
I
,
who
have
value
myself
on
my
ability
!
<EOS>
who
have
often
disdain
the
generous
candour
of
my
sister
,
and
gratify
my
vanity
,
in
useless
or
blameable
distrust
.
 
<EOS>
how
humiliating
be
this
discovery
!
 
<EOS>
yet
,
how
just
a
humiliation
!
 
<EOS>
have
I
be
in
love
,
I
could
not
have
be
more
wretchedly
blind
.
<EOS>
but
vanity
,
not
love
,
have
be
my
folly
.
 
<EOS>
pleased
with
the
preference
of
one
,
and
offend
by
the
neglect
of
the
other
,
on
the
very
beginning
of
our
acquaintance
,
I
have
court
prepossession
and
ignorance
,
and
drive
reason
away
,
where
either
be
concern
.
<EOS>
till
this
moment
,
I
never
know
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
from
herself
to
Jane
 
from
Jane
to
Bingley
,
her
thought
be
in
a
line
which
soon
bring
to
her
recollection
that
Mr.
Darcy
's
explanation
_
there
_
,
have
appear
very
insufficient
;
and
she
read
it
again
.
<EOS>
widely
different
be
the
effect
of
a
second
perusal
.
 
<EOS>
how
could
she
deny
that
credit
to
his
assertion
,
in
one
instance
,
which
she
have
be
oblige
to
give
in
the
other
?
 
<EOS>
He
declare
himself
to
have
be
totally
unsuspicious
of
her
sister
's
attachment
;
 
and
she
could
not
help
remember
what
Charlotte
's
opinion
have
always
be
.
 
<EOS>
neither
could
she
deny
the
justice
of
his
description
of
Jane
.
 
<EOS>
She
feel
that
Jane
's
feeling
,
though
fervent
,
be
little
display
,
and
that
there
be
a
constant
complacency
in
her
air
and
manner
,
not
often
united
with
great
sensibility
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
come
to
that
part
of
the
letter
in
which
her
family
be
mention
,
in
term
of
such
mortifying
,
yet
merit
reproach
,
her
sense
of
shame
be
severe
.
<EOS>
the
justice
of
the
charge
strike
her
too
forcibly
for
denial
,
and
the
circumstance
to
which
he
particularly
allude
,
as
have
pass
at
the
Netherfield
ball
,
and
as
confirm
all
his
first
disapprobation
,
could
not
have
make
a
strong
impression
on
his
mind
than
on
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
compliment
to
herself
and
her
sister
,
be
not
unfelt
.
<EOS>
It
soothe
,
but
it
could
not
console
her
for
the
contempt
which
have
be
thus
self
-
attract
by
the
rest
of
her
family
;
 
and
as
she
consider
that
Jane
's
disappointment
have
in
fact
be
the
work
of
her
near
relation
,
and
reflect
how
materially
the
credit
of
both
must
be
hurt
by
such
impropriety
of
conduct
,
she
feel
depressed
beyond
any
thing
she
have
ever
know
before
.
  
<EOS>
after
wander
along
the
lane
for
two
hour
,
give
way
to
every
variety
of
thought
;
re
-
consider
event
,
determine
probability
,
and
reconcile
herself
as
well
as
she
could
,
to
a
change
so
sudden
and
so
important
,
fatigue
,
and
a
recollection
of
her
long
absence
,
make
her
at
length
return
home
;
and
she
enter
the
house
with
the
wish
of
appear
cheerful
as
usual
,
and
the
resolution
of
repress
such
reflection
as
must
make
her
unfit
for
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
immediately
tell
,
that
the
two
gentleman
from
Rosings
have
each
call
during
her
absence
;
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
,
only
for
a
few
minute
to
take
leave
,
but
that
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
have
be
sit
with
them
at
least
an
hour
,
hope
for
her
return
,
and
almost
resolve
to
walk
after
her
till
she
could
be
find
.
 
<EOS>
Elizabeth
could
but
just
_
affect
_
concern
in
miss
him
;
she
really
rejoice
at
it
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
be
no
longer
an
object
.
<EOS>
She
could
think
only
of
her
letter
.
    
<EOS>
the
two
gentleman
leave
Rosings
the
next
morning
;
and
Mr.
Collins
have
be
in
wait
near
the
lodge
,
to
make
them
his
parting
obeisance
,
be
able
to
bring
home
the
pleasing
intelligence
,
of
their
appear
in
very
good
health
,
and
in
as
tolerable
spirit
as
could
be
expect
,
after
the
melancholy
scene
so
lately
go
through
at
rosing
.
<EOS>
to
Rosings
he
then
hasten
to
console
Lady
Catherine
,
and
her
daughter
;
and
on
his
return
,
bring
back
,
with
great
satisfaction
,
a
message
from
her
Ladyship
,
import
that
she
feel
herself
so
dull
as
to
make
her
very
desirous
of
have
them
all
to
dine
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
could
not
see
Lady
Catherine
without
recollect
,
that
have
she
choose
it
,
she
may
by
this
time
have
be
present
to
her
,
as
her
future
niece
;
nor
could
she
think
,
without
a
smile
,
of
what
her
ladyship
's
indignation
would
have
be
.
<EOS>
"
what
would
she
have
say
?
 
<EOS>
how
would
she
have
behave
?
"
be
question
with
which
she
amuse
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Their
first
subject
be
the
diminution
of
the
Rosings
party
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
I
feel
it
exceedingly
,
"
say
Lady
Catherine
;
"
I
believe
nobody
feel
the
loss
of
friend
so
much
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
particularly
attach
to
these
young
man
;
and
know
them
to
be
so
much
attach
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
They
be
excessively
sorry
to
go
!
<EOS>
but
so
they
always
be
.
<EOS>
the
dear
colonel
rally
his
spirit
tolerably
till
just
at
last
;
but
Darcy
seem
to
feel
it
most
acutely
,
more
I
think
than
last
year
.
<EOS>
His
attachment
to
Rosings
,
certainly
increase
.

<EOS>
Mr.

have
a
compliment
,

an
allusion
to
throw
in
here
,

be
kindly

Lady
Catherine
observe
,
after
dinner
,
that
Miss
Bennet

out
of
spirit

immediately
account
for
it

that

not
like
to
go
home
again
so
soon

she
add
,
  
"
<EOS>
but
if
that
be
the
case
,
you
must
write
to
your
mother
to
beg
that
you
may
stay
a
little
longer

Mrs.

will
be
very

Mrs.
Collins

you
must
send

know
I

I
can
not

the
idea

travel
post
by

It
be
highly
improper

You
must
contrive

I
have
the
great
dislike

<EOS>
Lady
Catherine
have
many
other
question
to
ask
respect
their
journey
,
and
as
she
do
not
answer
them
all
herself
,
attention
be
necessary
,
which
Elizabeth
believe
to
be
lucky
for
her
;
or
,
with
a
mind
so
occupied
,
she
may
have
forget
where
she
be
.
<EOS>
reflection
must
be
reserve
for
solitary
hour
;
whenever
she
be
alone
,
she
give
way
to
it
as
the
great
relief
;
and
not
a
day
go
by
without
a
solitary
walk
,
in
which
she
may
indulge
in
all
the
delight
of
unpleasant
recollection

<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
's
letter
,
she
be
in
a
fair
way
of
soon
know
by
heart
.
<EOS>
She
study
every
sentence
:
and
her
feeling
towards
its
writer
be
at
time
widely
different
.
<EOS>
when
she
remember
the
style
of
his
address
,
she
be
still
full
of
indignation
;
but
when
she
consider
how
unjustly
she
have
condemn
and
upbraid
him
,
her
anger
be
turn
against
herself
;
and
his
disappointed
feeling
become
the
object
of
compassion
.
<EOS>
His
attachment
excited
gratitude
,
his
general
character
respect
;
but
she
could
not
approve
him
;
nor
could
she
for
a
moment
repent
her
refusal
,
or
feel
the
slight
inclination
ever
to
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
in
her
own
past
behaviour
,
there
be
a
constant
source
of
vexation
and
regret
;
and
in
the
unhappy
defect
of
her
family
a
subject
of
yet
heavy
chagrin
.
<EOS>
They
be
hopeless
of
remedy
.
<EOS>
Her
father
,
content
with
laugh
at
them
,
would
never
exert
himself
to
restrain
the
wild
giddiness
of
his
young
daughter
;
and
her
mother
,
with
manner
so
far
from
right
herself
,
be
entirely
insensible
of
the
evil
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
have
frequently
unite
with
Jane
in
an
endeavour
to
check
the
imprudence
of
Catherine
and
Lydia
;
but
while
they
be
support
by
their
mother
's
indulgence
,
what
chance
could
there
be
of
improvement
?
<EOS>
Catherine
,
weak
-
spirited
,
irritable
,
and
completely
under
Lydia
's
guidance
,
have
be
always
affront
by
their
advice
;
and
Lydia
,
self
-
willed
and
careless
,
would
scarcely
give
them
a
hearing
.
<EOS>
They
be
ignorant
,
idle
,
and
vain
.
<EOS>
while
there
be
an
officer
in
Meryton
,
they
would
flirt
with
him
;
and
while
Meryton
be
within
a
walk
of
Longbourn
,
they
would
be
go
there
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
anxiety
on
Jane
's
behalf
,
be
another
prevail
concern
,
and
Mr.
Darcy
's
explanation
,
by
restore
Bingley
to
all
her
former
good
opinion
,
heighten
the
sense
of
what
Jane
have
lose
.
<EOS>
His
affection
be
prove
to
have
be
sincere
,
and
his
conduct
clear
of
all
blame
,
unless
any
could
attach
to
the
implicitness
of
his
confidence
in
his
friend
.
<EOS>
how
grievous
then
be
the
thought
that
,
of
a
situation
so
desirable
in
every
respect
,
so
replete
with
advantage
,
so
promise
for
happiness
,
Jane
have
be
deprive
,
by
the
folly
and
indecorum
of
her
own
family
!
  
<EOS>
when
to
these
recollection
be
add
the
developement
of
Wickham
's
character
,
it
may
be
easily
believe
that
the
happy
spirit
which
have
seldom
be
depress
before
,
be
now
so
much
affect
as
to
make
it
almost
impossible
for
her
to
appear
tolerably
cheerful
.
  
<EOS>
Their
engagement
at
rosing
be
as
frequent
during
the
last
week
of
her
stay
,
as
they
have
be
at
first
.
<EOS>
the
very
last
evening
be
spend
there
;
and
her
Ladyship
again
enquire
minutely
into
the
particular
of
their
journey
,
give
them
direction
as
to
the
good
method
of
packing
,
and
be
so
urgent
on
the
necessity
of
place
gown
in
the
only
right
way
,
that
Maria
think
herself
oblige
,
on
her
return
,
to
undo
all
the
work
of
the
morning
,
and
pack
her
trunk
afresh
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
part
,
Lady
Catherine
,
with
great
condescension
,
wish
them
a
good
journey
,
and
invite
them
to
come
to
Hunsford
again
next
year
;
and
Miss
De
Bourgh
exert
herself
so
far
as
to
curtsey
and
hold
out
her
hand
to
both
.
    
<EOS>
on
Saturday
morning
Elizabeth
and
Mr.
Collins
meet
for
breakfast
a
few
minute
before
the
other
appear
;
and
he
take
the
opportunity
of
pay
the
parting
civility
which
he
deem
indispensably
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
,
Miss
Elizabeth
,
"
say
he
,
"
whether
Mrs.
Collins
have
yet
express
her
sense
of
your
kindness
in
come
to
us
,
but
I
be
very
certain
you
will
not
leave
the
house
without
receive
her
thank
for
it
.
<EOS>
the
favour
of
your
company
have
be
much
feel
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
We
know
how
little
there
be
to
tempt
any
one
to
our
humble
abode
.
<EOS>
Our
plain
manner
of
living
,
our
small
room
,
and
few
domestic
,
and
the
little
we
see
of
the
world
,
must
make
Hunsford
extremely
dull
to
a
young
lady
like
yourself
;
but
I
hope
you
will
believe
us
grateful
for
the
condescension
,
and
that
we
have
do
every
thing
in
our
power
to
prevent
your
spend
your
time
unpleasantly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
eager
with
her
thank
and
assurance
of
happiness
.
<EOS>
She
have
spend
six
week
with
great
enjoyment
;
and
the
pleasure
of
be
with
Charlotte
,
and
the
kind
attention
she
have
receive
,
must
make
_
her
_
feel
the
oblige
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Collins
be
gratify
;
and
with
a
more
smile
solemnity
reply
,
  
<EOS>
"
It
give
me
the
great
pleasure
to
hear
that
you
have
pass
your
time
not
disagreeably
.
<EOS>
We
have
certainly
do
our
good
;
and
most
fortunately
have
it
in
our
power
to
introduce
you
to
very
superior
society
,
and
from
our
connection
with
rosing
,
the
frequent
mean
of
vary
the
humble
home
scene
,
I
think
we
may
flatter
ourselves
that
your
Hunsford
visit
can
not
have
be
entirely
irksome
.
<EOS>
Our
situation
with
regard
to
Lady
Catherine
's
family
be
indeed
the
sort
of
extraordinary
advantage
and
blessing
which
few
can
boast

<EOS>
You
see
on
what
a
footing
we
be
.
<EOS>
You
see
how
continually
we
be
engage
there
.
<EOS>
in
truth
I
must
acknowledge
that
,
with
all
the
disadvantage
of
this
humble
parsonage
,
I
should
not
think
any
one
abiding
in
it
an
object
of
compassion
,
while
they
be
sharer
of
our
intimacy
at
Rosings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
word
be
insufficient
for
the
elevation
of
his
feeling
;
and
he
be
oblige
to
walk
about
the
room
,
while
Elizabeth
try
to
unite
civility
and
truth
in
a
few
short
sentence
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
,
in
fact
,
carry
a
very
favourable
report
of

into
Hertfordshire

my
dear
cousin

<EOS>
I
flatter
myself
at
least
that
you
will
be
able
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Lady
Catherine
's
great
attention
to
Mrs.
Collins
<EOS>
you
have
be
a
daily
witness
of
;
and
altogether
I
trust
it
do
not
appear
that
your
friend
have
draw
an
unfortunate
 
<EOS>
but
on
this
point
it
will
be
as
well
to
be
silent
.
<EOS>
only
let
me
assure
you

my

that
I
can
from
my

most
cordially

<EOS>
My
dear
Charlotte
and
I
have
but
one
mind
and
one
way
of
thinking
.
<EOS>
there
be
in
every
thing
a
most
remarkable
resemblance
of
character
and
idea
between
us

<EOS>
We
seem
to
have

design

<EOS>
Elizabeth
could
safely
say
that
it
be
a
great
happiness
where
that
be
the
case
,
and
with
equal
sincerity
could
add
that
she
firmly
believe
and
rejoice
in
his
domestic
comfort

<EOS>
She
be
not
sorry
,
however
,
to
have
the
recital
of
them
interrupt
by
the
entrance
of
the
lady
from
whom
they

<EOS>
poor
Charlotte
!
 
<EOS>
it
be
melancholy
to
leave
her
to
such
society

<EOS>
but
she
have
choose
it
with
her
eye
open
;
and
though
evidently
regret
that
her
visitor
be
to
go
,
she
do
not

to
ask
for
compassion

<EOS>
Her
home
and
her
housekeeping

all

after

He

"
We

<EOS>
Their
journey
be
perform
without

within

Hunsford

Mr.
Gardiner
's
house

where
they
be
to
remain
a
few
day

<EOS>
Jane
look
well
,
and
Elizabeth
have
little
opportunity
of
study
her
spirit
,
amidst
the
various
engagement
which
the
kindness
of
her
aunt
have
reserve
for
them
.
<EOS>
but
Jane
be
to
go
home
with
her
,
and
at
Longbourn
there
would
be
leisure
enough
for
observation
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
without
an
effort
meanwhile
that
she
could
wait
even
for
Longbourn
,
before
she
tell
her
sister
of
Mr.
Darcy
's
proposal
.
<EOS>
to
know
that
she
have
the
power
of
reveal
what
would
so
exceedingly
astonish
Jane
,
and
must
,
at
the
same
time
,
so
highly
gratify
whatever
of
her
own
vanity
she
have
not
yet
be
able
to
reason
away
,
be
such
a
temptation
to
openness
as
nothing
could
have
conquer
,
but
the
state
of
indecision
in
which
she
remain
,
as
to
the
extent
of
what
she
should
communicate
;
and
her
fear
,
if
she
once
enter
on
the
subject
,
of
be
hurry
into
repeat
something
of
Bingley
,
which
may
only
grieve
her
sister
farther
.
    
<EOS>
It
be
the
second
week
in
May
,
in
which
the
three
young
lady
set
out
together
from
Gracechurch

street
,
for
the
town
of
 
in
Hertfordshire
;
and
,
as
they
draw
near
the
appoint
inn
where
Mr.
Bennet
's
carriage
be
to
meet
them
,
they
quickly
perceive
,
in
token
of
the
coachman
's
punctuality
,
both
Kitty
and
Lydia
look
out
of
a
dining
-
room
up
stair
.
<EOS>
these
two
girl
have
be
above
an
hour
in
the
place
,
happily
employ
in
visit
an
opposite
milliner
,
watch
the
sentinel
on
guard
,
and
dress
a
sallad
and
cucumber
.
  
<EOS>
after
welcome
their
sister
,
they
triumphantly
display
a
table
set
out
with
such
cold
meat
as
an
inn
larder
usually
afford
,
exclaim
,
"
be
not
this
nice
?
<EOS>
be
not
this
an
agreeable
surprise

<EOS>
"
and
we
mean
to
treat
you
all
,

add
Lydia
;
"
but
you
must
lend
us
the
money
,
for
we
have
just
spend
our

<EOS>
then
shew
her
purchase

"
look
here
,
I
have
buy
this
bonnet
.
<EOS>
I
do
not

it
be
very
pretty

but
I
think
I
may
as
well
buy
it
as
not

<EOS>
I
shall
pull
it
to
piece
as
soon
as
I
get
home

and
see
if
I
can
make
it
up
any
better

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
when
her
sister
abuse
it
as
ugly
,
she
add
,
with
perfect
unconcern
,
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
but
there
be
two
or
three
much
uglier
in
the
shop
;
and
when
I
have
buy
some
pretty
-
colour
satin
to
trim
it
with
fresh
,
I
think
it
will
be
very
tolerable

<EOS>
besides
,
it
will
not
much
signify
what
one
wear
this
summer
,
after
the
shire
have
leave
Meryton

they
be
go

great
satisfaction

"
They

near
Brighton

I
do
so
want
papa

take
us
all
there
for
the
summer

<EOS>
It
would
be
such
a
delicious
scheme

I
dare
say
would
hardly
cost
any

Mamma
would

"
now
I

they
sit
down
to

what
do

<EOS>
It

excellent
news

capital
news

about

Jane

Elizabeth
look
at
each
other

the
waiter
be

that
he

<EOS>
Lydia
laugh
,
and
say
,
  
"
aye
,
that
be
just
like
your
formality
and
discretion

<EOS>
You
think
the
waiter
must
not
hear
,
as
if
he
care
!
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
often
hear
bad
thing
say

I

but
he
be
an
ugly
fellow

I

<EOS>
I
never

such
a

<EOS>
well

but
now
for
my
news
:
it
be
about
dear
Wickham

too
good

not

<EOS>
there

She

I

I

coarseness

the
coarseness

little

<EOS>
as
soon
as
all
have
eat
,
and
the
elder
one
pay

the
carriage
be
order
;
and
after
some
contrivance
,
the
whole
party
,
with
all
their
box
,
workbag
,
and
parcel
,
and
the
unwelcome
addition
of
Kitty

Lydia

purchase

"
how
nicely
we

cram
in

Lydia

I
be
glad
I
buy
my
bonnet

if
it

only
for
the
fun
of
have
another
bandbox
!
<EOS>
well
,
now
let
us
be
quite
comfortable
and
snug
,
and
talk
and
laugh
all
the
way
home
.
<EOS>
and
in
the
first
place
,
let
us
hear
what
have
happen
to
you
all
,
since
you
go
away
.
<EOS>
have
you
see
any
pleasant
man
?
<EOS>
have
you
have
any
flirting
?
<EOS>
I
be
in
great
hope
that
one
of
you
would
have
get
a
husband
before
you
come
back
.
<EOS>
Jane
will
be
quite
an
old
maid
soon
,
I
declare
.
<EOS>
She
be
almost
three
and
twenty
!
<EOS>
Lord
,
how
ashamed
I
should
be
of
not
be
marry
before
three
and
twenty
!
<EOS>
My
aunt
Philips
want
you
so
to
get
husband
,
you
can
not
think
.
<EOS>
She
say
Lizzy
have
better
have
take
Mr.
Collins
;
but
_
I
_
do
not
think
there
would
have
be
any
fun
in
it
.
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
how
I
should
like
to
be
marry
before
any
of
you
;
and
then
I
would
chaperon
you
about
to
all
the
ball
.
<EOS>
dear
me
!
<EOS>
we
have
such
a
good
piece
of
fun
the
other
day
at
Colonel
Forster
's
.
<EOS>
Kitty
and
me
be
to
spend
the
day
there
,
and
Mrs.
Forster
promise
to
have
a
little
dance
in
the
evening
;
(
by
the
bye
,
Mrs.
Forster
and
me
be
_
<EOS>
such
_
friend
!
)
<EOS>
and
so
she
ask
the
two
Harringtons
to
come
,
but
Harriet
be
ill
,
and
so
Pen
be
force
to
come
by
herself
;
and
then
,
what
do
you
think
we
do
?
<EOS>
We
dress
up
Chamberlayne
in
woman
's
clothe
,
on
purpose
to
pass
for
a
lady
,
 
only
think
what
fun
!
<EOS>
not
a
soul
know
of
it
,
but
Col
.
and
Mrs.
Forster
,
and
Kitty
and
me
,
except
my
aunt
,
for
we
be
force
to
borrow
one
of
her
gown
;
and
you
can
not
imagine
how
well
he
look
!
<EOS>
when
Denny
,
and
Wickham
,
and
Pratt
,
and
two
or
three
more
of
the
man
come
in
,
they
do
not
know
him
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
how
I
laugh
!
<EOS>
and
so
do
Mrs.
Forster
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
have
die
.
<EOS>
and
_
that
_
make
the
man
suspect
something
,
and
then
they
soon
find
out
what
be
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
such
kind
of
history
of
their
party
and
good
joke
,
do
Lydia
,
assist
by
Kitty
's
hint
and
addition
,
endeavour
to
amuse
her
companion
all
the
way
to
Longbourn
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
listen
as
little
as
she
could
,
but
there
be
no
escape
the
frequent
mention
of
Wickham
's
name
.
  
<EOS>
Their
reception
at
home
be
most
kind
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
rejoice
to
see
Jane
in
undiminished
beauty
;
and
more
than
once
during
dinner
do
Mr.
Bennet
say
voluntarily
to
Elizabeth
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
you
be
come
back
,
Lizzy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Their
party
in
the
dining
-
room
be
large
,
for
almost
all
the
Lucases
come
to
meet
Maria
and
hear
the
news
:
and
various
be
the
subject
which
occupy
them
;
lady
Lucas
be
enquire
of
Maria
across
the
table
,
after
the
welfare
and
poultry
of
her
eld
daughter
;
Mrs.
Bennet
be
doubly
engage
,
on
one
hand
collect
an
account
of
the
present
fashion
from
Jane
,
who
sit
some
way
below
her
,
and
on
the
other
,
retail
them
all
to
the
young
Miss
Lucases
;
and
Lydia
,
in
a
voice
rather
louder
than
any
other
person
's
,
be
enumerate
the
various
pleasure
of
the
morning
to
any
body
who
would
hear
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
Mary
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
wish
you
have
go
with
us
,
for
we
have
such
fun
!
<EOS>
as
we
go
along
,
Kitty
and
me
draw
up
all
the
blind
,
and
pretend
there
be
nobody
in
the
coach
;
and
I
should
have
go
so
all
the
way
,
if
Kitty
have
not
be
sick
;
and
when
we
get
to
the
George
,
I
do
think
we
behave
very
handsomely
,
for
we
treat
the
other
three
with
the
nice
cold
luncheon
in
the
world
,
and
if
you
would
have
go
,
we
would
have
treat
you
too
.
<EOS>
and
then
when
we
come
away
it
be
such
fun
!
<EOS>
I
think
we
never
should
have
get
into
the
coach
.
<EOS>
I
be
ready
to
die
of
laughter
.
<EOS>
and
then
we
be
so
merry
all
the
way
home
!
<EOS>
we
talk
and
laugh
so
loud
,
that
any
body
may
have
hear
us
ten
mile
off
!
"
  
<EOS>
to
this
,
Mary
very
gravely
reply
,
"
far
be
it
from
me
,
my
dear
sister
,
to
depreciate
such
pleasure
.
<EOS>
They
would
doubtless
be
congenial
with
the
generality
of
female
mind
.
<EOS>
but
I
confess
they
would
have
no
charm
for
_
me
<EOS>
_
.
<EOS>
I
should
infinitely
prefer
a
book
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
of
this
answer
Lydia
hear
not
a
word
.
<EOS>
She
seldom
listen
to
any
body
for
more
than
half
a
minute
,
and
never
attend
to
Mary
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
Lydia
be
urgent
with
the
rest
of
the
girl
to
walk
to
Meryton
and
see
how
every
body
go
on
;
but
Elizabeth
steadily
oppose
the
scheme
.
<EOS>
It
should
not
be
say
,
that
the
Miss
Bennets
could
not
be
at
home
half
a
day
before
they
be
in
pursuit
of
the
officer
.
<EOS>
there
be
another
reason
too
for
her
opposition
.
<EOS>
She
dread
see
Wickham
again
,
and
be
resolve
to
avoid
it
as
long
as
possible
.
<EOS>
the
comfort
to
_
her
_
,
of
the
regiment
's
approach
removal
,
be
indeed
beyond
expression
.
<EOS>
in
a
fortnight
they
be
to
go
,
and
once
go
,
she
hope
there
could
be
nothing
more
to
plague
her
on
his
account
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
not
be
many
hour
at
home
,
before
she
find
that
the
Brighton
scheme
,
of
which
Lydia
have
give
them
a
hint
at
the
inn
,
be
under
frequent
discussion
between
her
parent
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
see
directly
that
her
father
have
not
the
small
intention
of
yield
;
but
his
answer
be
at
the
same
time
so
vague
and
equivocal
,
that
her
mother
,
though
often
dishearten
,
have
never
yet
despair
of
succeed
at
last
.
    
<EOS>
Elizabeth
's
impatience
to
acquaint
Jane
with
what
have
happen
could
no
longer
be
overcome
;
and
at
length
resolve
to
suppress
every
particular
in
which
her
sister
be
concern
,
and
prepare
her
to
be
surprised
<EOS>
,
she
relate
to
her
the
next
morning
the
chief
of
the
scene
between
Mr.
Darcy
and
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Bennet
's
astonishment
be
soon
lessen
by
the
strong
sisterly
partiality
which
make
any
admiration
of
Elizabeth
appear
perfectly
natural
;
and
all
surprise
be
shortly
lose
in
other
feeling
.
<EOS>
She
be
sorry
that
Mr.
Darcy
should
have
deliver
his
sentiment
in
a
manner
so
little
suited
to
recommend
them
;
but
still
more
be
she
grieve
for
the
unhappiness
which
her
sister
's
refusal
must
have
give
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
be
so
sure
of
succeed
,
be
wrong
,
"
say
she
;
"
and
certainly
ought
not
to
have
appear
;
but
consider
how
much
it
must
increase
his
disappointment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
"
reply
Elizabeth
,
"
I
be
heartily
sorry
for
him
;
but
he
have
other
feeling
which
will
probably
soon
drive
away
his
regard
for
me
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
blame
me
,
however
,
for
refuse
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
blame
you
!
<EOS>
oh
,
no
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
blame
me
for
have
speak
so
warmly
of
Wickham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
 
I
do
not
know
that
you
be
wrong
in
say
what
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
_
will
_
know
it
,
when
I
have
tell
you
what
happen
the
very
next
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
then
speak
of
the
letter
,
repeat
the
whole
of
its
content
as
far
as
they
concern
George
Wickham
.
<EOS>
what
a
stroke
be
this
for
poor
Jane
!
<EOS>
who
would
willingly
have
go
through
the
world
without
believe
that
so
much
wickedness
exist
in
the
whole
race
of
mankind
,
as
be
here
collect
in
one
individual
.
<EOS>
nor
be
Darcy
's
vindication
,
though
grateful
to
her
feeling
,
capable
of
console
her
for
such
discovery
.
<EOS>
most
earnestly
do
she
labour
to
prove
the
probability
of
error
,
and
seek
to
clear
one
,
without
involve
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
will
not
do
,
"
say
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
"
You
never
will
be
able
to
make
both
of
them
good
for
any
thing
.
<EOS>
take
your
choice
,
but
you
must
be
satisfied
with
only
one
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
such
a
quantity
of
merit
between
them
;
just
enough
to
make
one
good
sort
of
man
;
and
of
late
it
have
be
shift
about
pretty
much
.
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
be
incline
to
believe
it
<EOS>
all
Mr.
Darcy
's
,
but
you
shall
do
as
you
chuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
some
time
,
however
,
before
a
smile
could
be
extort
from
Jane
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
when
I
have
be
more
shocked
,
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
"
Wickham
so
very
bad
!
<EOS>
It
be
almost
past
belief
.
<EOS>
and
poor
Mr.
Darcy
!
<EOS>
dear
Lizzy
,
only
consider
what
he
must
have
suffer
.
<EOS>
such
a
disappointment
!
<EOS>
and
with
the
knowledge
of
your
ill
opinion
too
!
and
have
to
relate
such
a
thing
of
his
sister
!
<EOS>
It
be
really
too
distressing
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
must
feel
it
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
oh
!
no
,
my
regret
and
compassion
be
all
do
away
by
see
you
so
full
of
both
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
do
him
such
ample
justice
,
that
I
be
grow
every
moment
more
unconcerned
and
indifferent
.
<EOS>
Your
profusion
make
me
save
;
and
if
you
lament
over
him
much
longer
,
my
heart
will
be
as
light
as
a
feather
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Wickham
;
there
be
such
an
expression
of
goodness
in
his
countenance
!
<EOS>
such
an
openness
and
gentleness
in
his
manner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
certainly
be
some
great
mismanagement
in
the
education
of
those
two
young
man
.
<EOS>
one
have
get
all
the
goodness
,
and
the
other
all
the
appearance
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
think
Mr.
Darcy
so
deficient
in
the
_
appearance
_
of
it
as
you
use
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
yet
I
mean
to
be
uncommonly
clever
in
take
so
decide
a
dislike
to
him
,
without
any
reason
.
<EOS>
It
be
such
a
spur
to
one
's
genius
,
such
an
opening
for
wit
to
have
a
dislike
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
one
may
be
continually
abusive
without
say
any
thing
just
;
but
one
can
not
be
always
laugh
at
a
man
without
now
and
then
stumble
on
something
witty
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lizzy
,
when
you
first
read
that
letter
,
I
be
sure
you
could
not
treat
the
matter
as
you
do
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
could
not
.
<EOS>
I
be
uncomfortable
enough
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
uncomfortable
,
I
may
say
unhappy
.

and
with
no
one
to
speak
to
,
of
what
I
feel
,
no
Jane
to
comfort
me
and
say
that
I
have
not

so
very
weak
and
vain
and
nonsensical
as
I
know
I
have
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
I
want
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
unfortunate
that
you
should
have
use
such
very
strong
expression
in
speak
of
Wickham
to
Mr.
Darcy
,
for
now
they
_
do
_
appear
wholly
undeserved
.

certainly
.

but
the
misfortune
of
speak
with
bitterness
,
be
a
most
natural
consequence
of
the
prejudice
I
have
be
encouraging
.
<EOS>
there
be
one
point
,
on
which
I
want
your
advice

<EOS>
I
want
to
be
tell
whether
I
ought
,
or
ought
not
to
make
our
acquaintance
in
general
understand
Wickham
's
character
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Bennet
pause
a
little
and
then
reply
,
"
surely
there
can
be
no
occasion
for
expose
him
so
dreadfully
.
<EOS>
what
be
your
own
opinion
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
it
ought
not
to
be
attempt
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
have
not
authorise
me
to
make
his
communication
public
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
every
particular
relative
to
his
sister
,
be
mean
to
be
keep
as
much
as
possible
to
myself
;
and
if
I
endeavour
to
undeceive
people
as
to
the
rest
of
his
conduct
,
who
will
believe
me
?
<EOS>
the
general
prejudice
against
Mr.
Darcy
be
so
violent
,
that
it
would
be
the
death
of
half
the
good
people
in
Meryton
,
to
attempt
to
place
him
in
an
amiable
light
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
equal
to
it
.
<EOS>
Wickham
will
soon
be
go
;
and
therefore
it
will
not
signify
to
anybody
here
,
what
he
really
be
.
<EOS>
sometime
hence
it
will
be
all
find
out
,
and
then
we
may
laugh
at
their
stupidity
in
not
know
it
before
.
<EOS>
at
present
I
will
say
nothing
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
quite
right
.
<EOS>
to
have
his
error
make
public
may
ruin
him
for
ever

<EOS>
He
be
now
perhaps
sorry
for
what
he
have
do
,
and
anxious
to
re
-
establish
a
character

We
must
not
make
him
desperate

be
allay
by
this
conversation
.
<EOS>
She
have
get
rid
of
two
of
the
secret
which
have
weigh
on
her
for
a
fortnight
,
and
be
certain
of
a
willing
listener
in
Jane
,
whenever
she
may
wish
to
talk
again
of
either
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
still
something
lurk
behind
,
of
which
prudence
forbad
the
disclosure
.
<EOS>
She
dare
not
relate
the
other
half
of
Mr.
Darcy
's
letter
,
nor
explain
to
her
sister
how
sincerely
she
have
be
value
by
his
friend
.
<EOS>
here
be
knowledge
in
which
no
one
could
partake
;
and
she
be
sensible
that
nothing
less
than
a
perfect
understanding
between
the
party
could
justify
her
in
throw
off
this
last
incumbrance
of
mystery
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
"
say
she
,
"
if
that
very
improbable
event
should
ever
take
place
,
I
shall
merely
be
able
to
tell
what
Bingley
may
tell
in
a
much
more
agreeable
manner
himself
.
<EOS>
the
liberty
of
communication
can
not
be
mine
till
it
have
lose
all
its
value
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
now
,
on
be
settle
at
home
,
at
leisure
to
observe
the
real
state
of
her
sister
's
spirit
.
<EOS>
Jane
be
not
happy
.
<EOS>
She
still
cherish
a
very
tender
affection
for
Bingley
.
<EOS>
have
never
even
fancy
herself
in
love
before
,
her
regard
have
all
the
warmth
of
first
attachment
,
and
from
her
age
and
disposition
,
great
steadiness
than
first
attachment
often
boast
;
and
so
fervently
do
she
value
his
remembrance
,
and
prefer
him
to
every
other
man
,
that
all
her
good
sense
,
and
all
her
attention
to
the
feeling
of
her
friend
,
be
requisite
to
check
the
indulgence
of
those
regret
,
which
must
have
be
injurious
to
her
own
health
and
their
tranquillity
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Lizzy
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bennet
one
day
,
"
what
be
your
opinion
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
now
_
of
this
sad
business
of
Jane
's
?
<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
be
determine
never
to
speak
of
it
again
to
anybody
.
<EOS>
I
tell
my
sister
Philips
so
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
find
out
that
Jane
see
any
thing
of
him
in
London
.
<EOS>
well
,
he
be
a
very
undeserving
young
man
 
<EOS>
and
I
do
not
suppose
there
be
the
least
chance
in
the
world
of
her
ever
get
him
now
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
talk
of
his
come
to
Netherfield
again
in
the
summer
;
and
I
have
enquire
of
every
body
too
,
who
be
likely
to
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
that
he
will
ever
live
at
Netherfield
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
well
!
<EOS>
it
be
just
as
he
choose
.
<EOS>
nobody
want
him
to
come
.
<EOS>
though
I
shall
always
say
that
he
use
my
daughter
extremely
ill
;
and
if
I
be
her
,
I
would
not
have
put
up
with
it
.
<EOS>
well
,
my
comfort
be
,
I
be
sure
Jane
will
die
of
a
broken
heart
,
and
then
he
will
be
sorry
for
what
he
have
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
as
Elizabeth
could
not
receive
comfort
from
any
such
expectation
,
she
make
no
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Lizzy
,
"
continue
her
mother
soon
afterwards
,
"
and
so
the
Collinses
live
very
comfortable
,
do
they
?
<EOS>
well
,
well
,
I
only
hope
it
will
last
.
<EOS>
and
what
sort
of
table
do
they
keep
?
<EOS>
Charlotte
be
an
excellent
manager
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
if
she
be
half
as
sharp
as
her
mother
,
she
be
save
enough
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
extravagant
in
_
<EOS>
their
_
housekeeping
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
nothing
at
all
.
"
  
"
a
great
deal
of
good
management
,
depend
upon
it
.
<EOS>
yes
,
yes

<EOS>
_
<EOS>
They

will
take
care
not
to
outrun
their
income

<EOS>
_
<EOS>
They
_
will
never
be
distress
for
money
.
<EOS>
well
,
much
good
may
it
do
them
!
<EOS>
and
so
,
I
suppose
,
they
often
talk
of
have
Longbourn
when
your
father
be
dead
.
<EOS>
They
look
upon
it
quite
as
their
own
,
I
dare
say
,
whenever
that
happen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
subject
which
they
could
not
mention
before
me

"
  
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
strange
if
they
have
.
<EOS>
but
I
make
no
doubt
,
they
often
talk
of
it
between
themselves
.
<EOS>
well
,
if
they
can
be
easy
with
an
estate
that
be
not
lawfully
their
own
,
so
much
the
well
.
<EOS>
_
I
_
should
be
ashamed
of
have
one
that
be
only
entail
on
me
.
"
    
<EOS>
the
first
week
of
their
return
be
soon
go
.
<EOS>
the
second
begin
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
last
of
the
regiment
's
stay
in
Meryton
,
and
all
the
young
lady
in
the
neighbourhood
be
droop
apace
.
<EOS>
the
dejection
be
almost
universal
.
<EOS>
the
elder
Miss
Bennets
alone
be
still
able
to
eat
,
drink
,
and
sleep
,
and
pursue
the
usual
course
of
their
employment
.
<EOS>
very
frequently
be
they
reproach
for
this
insensibility
by
Kitty
and
Lydia
,
whose
own
misery
be
extreme
,
and
who
could
not
comprehend
such
hard
-
heartedness
in
any
of
the
family
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
Heaven
!
<EOS>
what
be
to
become
of
us
!
<EOS>
what
be
we
to
do
!
"
<EOS>
would
they
often
exclaim
in
the
bitterness
of
woe
.
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
be
smile
so
,
Lizzy
?
"
  
<EOS>
Their
affectionate
mother
share
all
their
grief
;
she
remember
what
she
have
herself
endure
on
a
similar
occasion
,
five
and
twenty
year
ago
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
cry
for
two
day
together
when
Colonel
Millar
's
regiment
go
away
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
have
break
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
shall
break
_
mine

Lydia
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
one
could
but
go
to
Brighton
!
"
observe
Mrs.
Bennet
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
!
 
<EOS>
if
one
could
but
go
to
Brighton
!
<EOS>
but
papa
be
so
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
little
sea
-
bathing
would
set
me
up
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
my
aunt
Philips
be
sure
it
would
do
_
me
_
a
great
deal
of
good
,
"
add
Kitty
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
kind
of
lamentation
resound
perpetually
through
Longbourn
-
house
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
try
to
be
divert
by
them
;
but
all
sense
of
pleasure
be
lose
in
shame
.
<EOS>
She
feel
anew
the
justice
of
Mr.
Darcy
's
objection
;
and
never
have
she
before
be
so
much
disposed
to
pardon
his
interference
in
the
view
of
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
gloom
of
Lydia
's
prospect
be
shortly
clear
away
;
for
she
receive
an
invitation
from
Mrs.
Forster
,
the
wife
of
the
Colonel
of
the
regiment
,
to
accompany
her
to
Brighton
.
<EOS>
this
invaluable
friend
be
a
very
young
woman
,
and
very
lately
married
.
<EOS>
a
resemblance
in
good
humour
and
good
spirit
have
recommend
her
and
Lydia
to
each
other
,
and
out
of
their
_
three
<EOS>
_
month
'
acquaintance
<EOS>
they
have
be
intimate
_
<EOS>
two
_
.
  
<EOS>
the
rapture
of
Lydia
on
this
occasion
,
her
adoration
of
Mrs.
Forster
,
the
delight
of
Mrs.
Bennet
,
and
the
mortification
of
Kitty
,
be
scarcely
to
be
describe
.
<EOS>
wholly
inattentive
to
her
sister
's
feeling
,
Lydia
fly
about
the
house
in
restless
ecstacy
,
call
for
every
one
's
congratulation
,
and
laugh
and
talk
with
more
violence
than
ever
;
whilst
the
luckless
Kitty
continue
in
the
parlour
repining
at
her
fate
in
term
as
unreasonable
as
her
accent
be
peevish
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
see
why
Mrs.
Forster
should
not
ask
_
me
_
as
well
as
Lydia
,
"
say
she
,
"
though
I
be
_
not
_
her
particular
friend
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
as
much
right
to
be
ask
as
she
have
,
and
more
too
,
for
I
be
two
year
old
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
vain
do
Elizabeth
attempt
to
make
her
reasonable
,
and
Jane
to
make
her
resign
.
<EOS>
as
for
Elizabeth
herself
,
this
invitation
be
so
far
from
exciting
in
her
the
same
feeling
as
in
her
mother
and
Lydia
,
that
she
consider
it
as
the
death
-
warrant
of
all
possibility
of
common
sense
for
the
latter
;
and
detestable
as
such
a
step
must
make
her
be
it
know
,
she
could
not
help
secretly
advise
her
father
not
to
let
her
go
.
<EOS>
She
represent
to
him
all
the
impropriety
of
Lydia
's
general
behaviour
,
the
little
advantage
she
could
derive
from
the
friendship
of
such
a
woman
as
Mrs.
Forster
,
and
the
probability
of
her
be
yet
more
imprudent
with
such
a
companion
at
Brighton
,
where
the
temptation
must
be
great
than
at
home
.
<EOS>
He
hear
her
attentively
,
and
then
say
,
  
"
Lydia
will
never
be
easy
till
she
have
expose
herself
in
some
public
place
or
other
,
and
we
can
never
expect
her
to
do
it
with
so
little
expense
or
inconvenience
to
her
family
as
under
the
present
circumstance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
aware
,
"
say
Elizabeth
,
"
of
the
very
great
disadvantage
to
us
all
,
which
must
arise
from
the
public
notice
of
Lydia
's
unguarded
and
imprudent
manner
;
<EOS>
nay
,
which
have
already
arise
from
it
,
I
be
sure
you
would
judge
differently
in
the
affair
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
already
arise
!
"
repeat
Mr.
Bennet
.
<EOS>
"
what
,
have
she
frighten
away
some
of
your
lover
?
<EOS>
poor
little
Lizzy
!
<EOS>
but
do
not
be
cast
down
.
<EOS>
such
squeamish
youth
as
can
not
bear
to
be
connect
with
a
little
absurdity
,
be
not
worth
a
regret
.
<EOS>
come
,
let
me
see
the
list
of
the
pitiful
fellow
who
have
be
keep
aloof
by
Lydia
's
folly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
you
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
such
injury
to
resent
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
of
peculiar
,
but
of
general
evil
,
which
I
be
now
complain
.
<EOS>
Our
importance
,
our
respectability
in
the
world
,
must
be
affect
by
the
wild
volatility
,
the
assurance
and
disdain
of
all
restraint
which
mark
Lydia
's
character
.
<EOS>
excuse
me
 
for
I
must
speak
plainly
.
<EOS>
if
you
,
my
dear
father
,
will
not
take
the
trouble
of
check
her
exuberant
spirit
,
and
of
teach
her
that
her
present
pursuit
be
not
to
be
the
business
of
her
life
,
she
will
soon
be
beyond
the
reach
of
amendment
.
<EOS>
Her
character
will
be
fix
,
and
she
will
,
at
sixteen
,
be
the
most
determined
flirt
that
ever
make
herself
and
her
family
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
a
flirt
too
,
in
the
bad
and
mean
degree
of
flirtation
;
without
any
attraction
beyond
youth
and
a
tolerable
person
;
and
from
the
ignorance
and
emptiness
of
her
mind
,
wholly
unable
to
ward
off
any
portion
of
that
universal
contempt
which
her
rage
for
admiration
will
excite
.
<EOS>
in
this
danger
Kitty
be
also
comprehend
.
<EOS>
She
will
follow
wherever
Lydia
lead
.
<EOS>
vain
,
ignorant
,
idle
,
and
absolutely
uncontrouled
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
my
dear
father
,
can
you
suppose
it
possible
that
they
will
not
be
censure
and
despise
wherever
they
be
know
,
and
that
their
sister
will
not
be
often
involve
in
the
disgrace
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bennet
see
that
her
whole
heart
be
in
the
subject
;
and
affectionately
take
her
hand
,
say
in
reply
,
  
"
do
not
make
yourself
uneasy
,
my
love
.
<EOS>
wherever
you
and
Jane
be
know
,
you
must
be
respect
and
value
;
and
you
will
not
appear
to
less
advantage
for
have
a
couple
of
 
or
I
may
say
,
three
very
silly
sister
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
no
peace
at
Longbourn
if
Lydia
do
not
go
to
Brighton
.
<EOS>
let
her
go
then
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Forster
be
a
sensible
man
,
and
will
keep
her
out
of
any
real
mischief
;
and
she
be
luckily
too
poor
to
be
an
object
of
prey
to
any
body
.
<EOS>
at
Brighton
she
will
be
of
less
importance
even
as
a
common
flirt
than
she
have
be
here
.
<EOS>
the
officer
will
find
woman
better
worth
their
notice
.
<EOS>
let
us
hope
,
therefore
,
that
her
be
there
may
teach
her
her
own
insignificance
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
she
can
not
grow
many
degree
bad
,
without
authorize
us
to
lock
her
up
for
the
rest
of
her
life
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
this
answer
Elizabeth
be
force
to
be
content
;
but
her
own
opinion
continue
the
same
,
and
she
leave
him
disappointed
and
sorry
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
in
her
nature
,
however
,
to
increase
her
vexation
,
by
dwell
on
them
.
<EOS>
She
be
confident
of
have
perform
her
duty
,
and
to
fret
over
unavoidable
evil
,
or
augment
them
by
anxiety
,
be
no
part
of
her
disposition
.
  
<EOS>
have
Lydia
and
her
mother
know
the
substance
of
her
conference
with
her
father
,
their
indignation
would
hardly
have
find
expression
in
their
united
volubility
.
<EOS>
in
Lydia
's
imagination
,
a
visit
to
Brighton
comprise
every
possibility
of
earthly
happiness
.
<EOS>
She
see
with
the
creative
eye
of
fancy
,
the
street
of
that
gay
bathing
place
cover
with
officer
.
<EOS>
She
see
herself
the
object
of
attention
,
to
ten
and
to
score
of
them
at
present
unknown
.
<EOS>
She
see
all
the
glory
of
the
camp
;
its
tent
stretch
forth
in
beauteous
uniformity
of
line
,
crowd
with
the
young
and
the
gay
,
and
dazzle
with
scarlet
;
and
to
complete
the
view
,
she
see
herself
seat
beneath
a
tent
,
tenderly
flirt
with
at
least
six
officer
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
have
she
know
that
her
sister
seek
to
tear
her
from
such
prospect
and
such
reality
as
these
,
what
would
have
be
her
sensation
?
<EOS>
They
could
have
be
understand
only
by
her
mother
,
who
may
have
feel
nearly
the
same
.
<EOS>
Lydia
's
go
to
Brighton
be
all
that
console
her
for
the
melancholy
conviction
of
her
husband
's
never
intend
to
go
there
himself
.
  
<EOS>
but
they
be
entirely
ignorant
of
what
have
pass
;
and
their
rapture
continue
with
little
intermission
to
the
very
day
of
Lydia
's
leave
home
.
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
now
to
see
Mr.
Wickham
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
have
be
frequently
in
company
with
him
since
her
return
,
agitation
be
pretty
well
over
;
the
agitation
of
former
partiality
entirely
so
.
<EOS>
She
have
even
learn
to
detect
,
in
the
very
gentleness
which
have
first
delight
her
,
an
affectation
and
a
sameness
to
disgust
and
weary
.
<EOS>
in
his
present
behaviour
to
herself
,
moreover
,
she
have
a
fresh
source
of
displeasure
,
for
the
inclination
he
soon
testify
of
renew
those
attention
which
have
mark
the
early
part
of
their
acquaintance
,
could
only
serve
,
after
what
have
since
pass
,
to
provoke
her
.
<EOS>
She
lose
all
concern
for
him
in
find
herself
thus
select
as
the
object
of
such
idle
and
frivolous
gallantry
;
and
while
she
steadily
repress
it
,
could
not
but
feel
the
reproof
contain
in
his
believing
,
that
however
long
,
and
for
whatever
cause
,
his
attention
have
be
withdraw
,
her
vanity
would
be
gratify
and
her
preference
secure
at
any
time
by
their
renewal
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
very
last
day
of
the
regiment
's
remain
in
Meryton
,
he
dine
with
other
of
the
officer
at
Longbourn
;
and
so
little
be
Elizabeth
<EOS>
dispose
to
part
from
him
in
good
humour
,
that
on
his
make
some
enquiry
as
to
the
manner
in
which
her
time
have
pass
at
Hunsford
,
she
mention
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
's
and
Mr.
Darcy
's
have
both
spend
three
week
at
Rosings
,
and
ask
him
if
he
be
acquaint
with
the
former
.
  
<EOS>
He
look
surprised
,
displeased
,
alarm
;
but
with
a
moment
's
recollection
and
a
return
smile
,
reply
,
that
he
have
formerly
see
him
often
;
and
after
observe
that
he
be
a
very
gentleman
-
like
man
,
ask
her
how
she
have
like
him
.
<EOS>
Her
answer
be
warmly
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
with
an
air
of
indifference
he
soon
afterwards
add
,
"
how
long
do
you
say
that
he
be
at
Rosings
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
nearly
three
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
you
see
him
frequently
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
almost
every
day
.
"
  
"
His
manner
be
very
different
from
his
cousin
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
very
different
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
Mr.
Darcy
improve
on
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
indeed
!
"
cry
Wickham
with
a
look
which
do
not
escape
her
.
"
<EOS>
and
pray
may
I
ask
?
"
<EOS>
but
check
himself
,
he
add
in
a
gayer
tone
,
"
be
it
in
address
that
he
improve
?
<EOS>
have
he
deign
to
add
ought
of
civility
to
his
ordinary
style
?
<EOS>
for
I
dare
not
hope
,
"
he
continue
in
a
low
and
more
serious
tone
,
"
that
he
be
improve
in
essential
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
no
!
"
say
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
essential
,
I
believe
,
he
be
very
much
what
he
ever
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
while
she
speak
,
Wickham
look
as
if
scarcely
know
whether
to
rejoice
over
her
word
,
or
to
distrust
their
meaning
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
something
in
her
countenance
which
make
him
listen
with
an
apprehensive
and
anxious
attention
,
while
she
add
,
  
"
<EOS>
when
I
say
that
he
improve
on
acquaintance
,
I
do
not
mean
that
either
his
mind
or
manner
be
in
a
state
of
improvement
,
but
that
from
know
him
better
,
his
disposition
be
better
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Wickham
's
alarm
now
appear
in
a
heighten
complexion
and
agitate
look
;
for
a
few
minute
he
be
silent
;
till
,
shake
off
his
embarrassment
,
he
turn
to
her
again
,
and
say
in
the
gentle
of
accent
,
  
"
You
,
who
so
well
know
my
feeling
towards
Mr.
Darcy
,
will
readily
comprehend
how
sincerely
I
must
rejoice
that
he
be
wise
enough
to
assume
even
the
_
appearance
<EOS>
_
of
what
be
right
.
<EOS>
His
pride
,
in
that
direction
,
may
be
of
service
,
if
not
to
himself
,
to
many
other
,
for
it
must
deter
him
from
such
foul
misconduct
as
I
have
suffer
by
.
<EOS>
I
only
fear
that
the
sort
of
cautiousness
,
to
which
you
,
I
imagine
,
have
be
allude
,
be
merely
adopt
on
his
visit
to
his
aunt
,
of
whose
good
opinion
and
judgment
<EOS>
he
stand
much
in
awe
.
<EOS>
His
fear
of
her
,
have
always
operate
,
I
know
,
when
they
be
together
;
and
a
good
deal
be
to
be
impute
to
his
wish
of
forward
the
match
with
Miss
De
Bourgh
,
which
I
be
certain
he
have
very
much
at
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
could
not
repress
a
smile
at
this
,
but
she
answer
only
by
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head
.
<EOS>
She
see
that
he
want
to
engage
her
on
the
old
subject
of
his
grievance
,
and
she
be
in
no
humour
to
indulge
him
.
<EOS>
the
rest
of
the
evening
pass
with
the
_
appearance
_
,
on
his
side
,
of
usual
cheerfulness
,
but
with
no
farther
attempt
to
distinguish
Elizabeth
;
and
they
part
at
last
with
mutual
civility
,
and
possibly
a
mutual
desire
of
never
meet
again
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
party
break
up
,
Lydia
return
with
Mrs.
Forster
to
Meryton
,
from
whence
they
be
to
set
out
early
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
the
separation
between
her
and
her
family
be
rather
noisy
than
pathetic
.
<EOS>
Kitty
be
the
only
one
who
shed
tear
;
but
she
do
weep
from
vexation
and
envy
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
be
diffuse
in
her
good
wish
for
the
felicity
of
her
daughter
,
and
impressive
in
her
injunction
that
she
would
not
miss
the
opportunity
of
enjoy
herself
as
much
as
possible
;
advice
,
which
there
be
every
reason
to
believe
would
be
attend
to
;
and
in
the
clamorous
happiness
of
Lydia
herself
in
bidding
farewell
,
the
more
gentle
adieus
of
her
sister
be
utter
without
be
hear
.
    
<EOS>
have
Elizabeth
's
opinion
be
all
draw
from
her
own
family
,
she
could
not
have
form
a
very
pleasing
picture
of
conjugal
felicity
or
domestic
comfort
.
<EOS>
Her
father
captivate
by
youth
and
beauty
,
and
that
appearance
of
good
humour
,
which
youth
and
beauty
generally
give
,
have
marry
a
woman
whose
weak
understanding
and
illiberal
mind
,
have
very
early
in
their
marriage
put
an
end
to
all
real
affection
for
her
.
<EOS>
respect
,
esteem
,
and
confidence
,
have
vanish
for
ever
;
and
all
his
view
of
domestic
happiness
be
overthrow
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Bennet
be
not
of
a
disposition
to
seek
comfort
for
the
disappointment
which
his
own
imprudence
have
bring
on
,
in
any
of
those
pleasure
which
too
often
console
the
unfortunate
for
their
folly
or
their
vice
.
<EOS>
He
be
fond
of
the
country
and
of
book
;
and
from
these
taste
have
arise
his
principal
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
to
his
wife
he
be
very
little
otherwise
indebted
,
than
as
her
ignorance
and
folly
have
contribute
to
his
amusement
.
<EOS>
this
be
not
the
sort
of
happiness
which
a
man
would
in
general
wish
to
owe
to
his
wife
;
but
where
other
power
of
entertainment
be
want
,
the
true
philosopher
will
derive
benefit
from
such
as
be
give
.
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
,
however
,
have
never
be
blind
to
the
impropriety
of
her
father
's
behaviour
as
a
husband
.
<EOS>
She
have
always
see
it
with
pain
;
but
respect
his
ability
,
and
grateful
for
his
affectionate
treatment
of
herself
,
she
endeavour
to
forget
what
she
could
not
overlook
,
and
to
banish
from
her
thought
that
continual
breach
of
conjugal
obligation
and
decorum
which
,
in
expose
his
wife
to
the
contempt
of
her
own
child
,
be
so
highly
reprehensible
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
never
feel
so
strongly
as
now
,
the
disadvantage
which
must
attend
the
child
of
so
unsuitable
a
marriage
,
nor
ever
be
so
fully
aware
of
the
evil
arise
from
so
ill
-
judge
a
direction
of
talent
;
talent
which
rightly
use
,
may
at
least
have
preserve
the
respectability
of
his
daughter
,
even
if
incapable
of
enlarge
the
mind
of
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
when
Elizabeth
have
rejoice
over
Wickham
's
departure
,
she
find
little
other
cause
for
satisfaction
in
the
loss
of
the
regiment
.
<EOS>
Their
party
abroad
be
less
varied
than
before
;
and
at
home
she
have
a
mother
and
sister
whose
constant
repining
at
the
dulness
of
every
thing
around
them
,
throw
a
real
gloom
over
their
domestic
circle
;
and
,
though
Kitty
may
in
time
regain
her
natural
degree
of
sense
,
since
the
disturber
of
her
brain
be
remove
,
her
other
sister
,
from
whose
disposition
<EOS>
great
evil
may
be
apprehend
,
be
likely
to
be
harden
in
all
her
folly
and
assurance
,
by
a
situation
of
such
double
danger
as
a
watering
place
and
a
camp
.
<EOS>
upon
the
whole
,
therefore
,
she
find
,
what
have
be
sometimes
find
before
,
that
an
event
to
which
she
have
look
forward
with
impatient
desire
,
do
not
in
take
place
,
bring
all
the
satisfaction
she
have
promise
herself
.
<EOS>
It
be
consequently
necessary
to
name
some
other
period
for
the
commencement
of
actual
felicity
;
to
have
some
other
point
on
which
her
wish
and
hope
may
be
fix
,
and
by
again
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
anticipation
,
console
herself
for
the
present
,
and
prepare
for
another
disappointment
.
<EOS>
Her
tour
to
the
Lakes
be
now
the
object
of
her
happy
thought
;
it
be
her
good
consolation
for
all
the
uncomfortable
hour
,
which
the
discontentedness
of
her
mother
and
Kitty
make
inevitable
;
and
could
she
have
include
Jane
in
the
scheme
,
every
part
of
it
would
have
be
perfect
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
fortunate
,
"
think
she
,
"
that
I
have
something
to
wish
for
.
<EOS>
be
the
whole
arrangement
complete
,
my
disappointment
would
be
certain
.
<EOS>
but
here
,
by
carry
with
me
one
ceaseless
source
of
regret
in
my
sister
's
absence
,
I
may
reasonably
hope
to
have
all
my
expectation
of
pleasure
realize
.
<EOS>
a
scheme
of
which
every
part
promise
delight
,
can
never
be
successful
;
and
general
disappointment
be
only
ward
off
by
the
defence
of
some
little
peculiar
vexation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
Lydia
go
away
,
she
promise
to
write
very
often
and
very
minutely
to
her
mother
and
Kitty
;
but
her
letter
be
always
long
expect
,
and
always
very
short
.
<EOS>
those
to
her
mother
,
contain
little
else
,
than
that
they
be
just
return
from
the
library
,
where
such
and
such
officer
have
attend
them
,
and
where
she
have
see
such
beautiful
ornament
as
make
her
quite
wild
;
that
she
have
a
new
gown
,
or
a
new
parasol
,
which
she
would
have
describe
more
fully
,
but
be
oblige
to
leave
off
in
a
violent
hurry
,
as
Mrs.
Forster
call
her
,
and
they
be
go
to
the
camp
;
 
and
from
her
correspondence
with
her
sister
,
there
be
still
less
to
be
learn
 
for
her
letter
to
Kitty
,
though
rather
longer
,
be
much
too
full
of
line
under
the
word
to
be
make
public
.
  
<EOS>
after
the
first
fortnight
or
three
week
of
her
absence
,
health
,
good
humour
and
cheerfulness
begin
to
re
-
appear
at
Longbourn
.
<EOS>
everything
wear
a
happy
aspect
.
<EOS>
the
family
who
have
be
in
town
for
the
winter
come
back
again
,
and
summer
finery
and
summer
engagement
arise
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
be
restore
to
her
usual
querulous
serenity
,
and
by
the
middle
of
June
Kitty
be
so
much
recover
as
to
be
able
to
enter
Meryton
without
tear
;
an
event
of
such
happy
promise
as
to
make
Elizabeth
hope
,
that
by
the
follow
Christmas
,
she
may
be
so
tolerably
reasonable
as
not
to
mention
an
officer
above
once
a
day
,
unless
by
some
cruel
and
malicious
arrangement
at
the
war
-
office
,
another
regiment
should
be
quarter
in
Meryton
.
  
<EOS>
the
time
fix
for
the
beginning
of
their
northern
tour
be
now
fast
approach
;
and
a
fortnight
only
be
want
of
it
,
when
a
letter
arrive
from
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
which
at
once
delay
its
commencement
and
curtail
its
extent
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gardiner
would
be
prevent
by
business
from
set
out
till
a
fortnight
later
in
July
,
and
must
be
in
London
again
within
a
month
;
and
as
that
leave
too
short
a
period
for
them
to
go
so
far
,
and
see
so
much
as
they
have
propose
,
or
at
least
to
see
it
with
the
leisure
and
comfort
they
have
build
on
,
they
be
oblige
to
give
up
the
Lakes
,
and
substitute
a
more
contract
tour
;
and
,
accord
to
the
present
plan
,
be
to
go
no
farther
northward
than
Derbyshire
.
<EOS>
in
that
county
,
there
be
enough
to
be
see
,
to
occupy
the
chief
of
their
three
week
;
and
to
Mrs.
Gardiner
it
have
a
peculiarly
strong
attraction
.
<EOS>
the
town
where
she
have
formerly
pass
some
year
of
her
life
,
and
where
they
be
now
to
spend
a
few
day
,
be
probably
as
great
an
object
of
her
curiosity
,
as
all
the
celebrated
beauty
of
Matlock
,
Chatsworth
,
Dovedale
,
or
the
Peak
.
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
excessively
disappointed
;
she
have
set
her
heart
on
see
the
Lakes
;
and
still
think
there
may
have
be
time
enough
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
her
business
to
be
satisfied
 
and
certainly
her
temper
to
be
happy
;
and
all
be
soon
right
again
.
  
<EOS>
with
the
mention
of
Derbyshire
,
there
be
many
idea
connect
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
her
to
see
the
word
without
think
of
Pemberley
and
its
owner
.
"
<EOS>
but
surely
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
may
enter
his
county
with
impunity
,
and
rob
it
of
a
few
petrified
spar
without
his
perceive
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
period
of
expectation
be
now
double
.
<EOS>
four
week
be
to
pass
away
before
her
uncle
and
aunt
's
arrival
.
<EOS>
but
they
do
pass
away
,
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
with
their
four
child
,
do
at
length
appear
at
Longbourn
.
<EOS>
the
child
,
two
girl
of
six
and
eight
year
old
,
and
two
young
boy
,
be
to
be
leave
under
the
particular
care
of
their
cousin
Jane
,
who
be
the
general
favourite

whose
steady
sense

sweetness

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
distressed
.
<EOS>
She
feel
that
she
have
no
business
at
Pemberley
,
and
be
oblige
to
assume
a
disinclination
for
see
it
.
<EOS>
She
must
own
that
she
be
tired
of
great
house
;
after
go
over
so
many
,
she
really
have
no
pleasure
in
fine
carpet

<EOS>
Mrs.

abuse
her
stupidity

<EOS>
"
if

"
say
she
,
"
I
should
not

about
it
myself

but
the
ground

<EOS>
They

"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth

<EOS>
It
would
be
dreadful

<EOS>
She
blush
at
the
very
idea
;
and
think
it
would
be
well
to
speak
openly
to
her
aunt
,
than
to
run
such
a
risk
.
<EOS>
but
against
this
,
there
be
objection
;
and
she
finally
resolve
that
it
could
be
the
last
resource
,
if
her
private
enquiry
as
to
the
absence
of
the
family
,
be
unfavourably
answer

<EOS>
accordingly
,
when

the
chambermaid
whether
Pemberley

a
very
fine
place
<EOS>

be
the

when

the
next
morning

could
readily
answer

<EOS>
They
enter
it
in
one
of
its

and

for
some
time
through
a

<EOS>
Elizabeth

<EOS>
They
gradually

<EOS>
They

warm
in
their
admiration
;
and
at
that
moment
she
feel
,
that
to
be
mistress
of
Pemberley
may
be
something
!
  
<EOS>
They
descend

<EOS>
the
housekeeper

;
a

elderly

more
civil

<EOS>
They
follow
her
into

<EOS>
It

handsomely

<EOS>
every

she
look
on
the
whole

,
the
river

the
tree
scatter
on
its
bank

and
the
winding
of
the

,
as

<EOS>
as
they
pass
into

these

.
<EOS>
the
room
be
lofty
and
handsome
,
and
their
furniture
suitable
to
the
fortune
of
their
proprietor
;
but
Elizabeth
see
,
with
admiration
of
his
taste
,
that
it
be
neither
gaudy
nor
uselessly
fine
;
with
less
of
splendor
,
and
more
real
elegance
,
than
the
furniture
of
Rosings

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
this

She

<EOS>
Elizabeth

<EOS>
Mrs.

She

and
she
dwell
with
energy
on
his
many
merit
,
as
they
proceed
together
up
the
great
staircase
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
the
good
landlord
,
and
the
good
master
,
"
say
she
,
"
that
ever
live

<EOS>
not
like
the
wild
young
man
now
-
a
-
day
,
who
think
of
nothing
but
themselves
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
one
of
his
tenant
or
servant
but
what
will
give
him
a
good
name
.
<EOS>
some
people
call
him
proud
;
but
I
be
sure
I
never
see
any
thing
of
it
.
<EOS>
to
my
fancy
,
it
be
only
because
he
do
not
rattle
away
like
other
young
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
what
an
amiable
light
do
this
place
him
!
"
think
Elizabeth
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
fine
account
of
him
,
"
whisper
her
aunt
,
as
they
walk
,
"
be
not
quite
consistent
with
his
behaviour
to
our
poor
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
we
may
be
deceive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
not
very
likely
;
our
authority
be
too
good

"
  
<EOS>
on
reach
the
spacious
lobby
above
,
they
be
shew
into
a
very
pretty
sitting
-
room
,
lately
fit
up
with
great
elegance
and
lightness
than
the
apartment
below
;
and
be
inform
that
it
be
but
just
do
,
to
give
pleasure
to
Miss
Darcy
,
who
have
take
a
liking
to
the
room
,
when
last
at
Pemberley
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
certainly
a
good
brother
,
"
say
Elizabeth
,
as
she
walk
towards
one
of
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reynolds
anticipate
Miss
Darcy
's
delight
,
when
she
should
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
and
this
be
always
the
way
with
him
,
"
she
add
.
 
<EOS>
"
whatever
can
give
his
sister
any
pleasure
,
be
sure
to
be
do
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
he
would
not
do
for
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
picture
gallery
,
and
two
or
three
of
the
principal
bed
-
room
,
be
all
that
remain
to
be
shew
.
<EOS>
in
the
former
be
many
good
painting
;
but
Elizabeth
know
nothing
of
the
art
;
and
from
such
as
have
be
already
visible
below
,
she
have
willingly
turn
to
look
at
some
drawing
of
Miss
Darcy
's
,
in
crayon
,
whose
subject
be
usually
more
interesting
,
and
also
more
intelligible
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
gallery
there
be
many
family
portrait
,
but
they
could
have
little
to
fix
the
attention
of
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
walk
on
in
quest
of
the
only
face
whose
feature
would
be
know
to
her
.
<EOS>
at
last
it
arrest
her
 
and
she
behold
a
striking
resemblance
of
Mr.
Darcy
,
with
such
a
smile
over
the
face
,
as
she
remember
to
have
sometimes
see
,
when
he
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
She
stand
several
minute
before
the
picture
in
earnest
contemplation
,
and
return
to
it
again
before
they
quit
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Reynolds
inform
them
,
that
it
have
be
take
in
his
father
's
life
time
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
certainly
at
this
moment
,
in
Elizabeth
's
mind
,
a
more
gentle
sensation
towards
the
original
,
than
she
have
ever
feel
in
the
height
of
their
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
the
commendation
bestow
on
him
by
Mrs.
Reynolds
be
of
no
trifling
nature
.
<EOS>
what
praise
be
more
valuable
than
the
praise
of
an
intelligent
servant
?
<EOS>
as
a
brother
,
a
landlord
,
a
master
,
she
consider
how
many
people
's
happiness
be
in
his
guardianship
!
 
<EOS>
how
much
of
pleasure
or
pain
it
be
in
his
power
to
bestow
!
 
<EOS>
how
much
of
good
or
evil
must
be
do
by
him
!
<EOS>
every
idea
that
have
be
bring
forward
by
the
housekeeper
be
favourable
to
his
character
,
and
as
she
stand
before
the
canvas
,
on
which
he
be
represent
,
and
fix
his
eye
upon
herself
,
she
think
of
his
regard
with
a
deep
sentiment
of
gratitude
than
it
have
ever
raise
before
;
she
remember
its
warmth
,
and
soften
its
impropriety
of
expression
.
  
<EOS>
when
all
of
the
house
that
be
open
to
general
inspection
have
be
see
,
they
return
down
stair
,
and
take
leave
of
the
housekeeper
,
be
consign
over
to
the
gardener
,
who
meet
them
at
the
hall
door
.
  
<EOS>
as
they
walk
across
the
lawn
towards
the
river
,
Elizabeth
turn
back
to
look
again
;
her
uncle
and
aunt
stop
also
,
and
while
the
former
be
conjecture
as
to
the
date
of
the
building
,
the
owner
of
it
himself
suddenly
come
forward
from
the
road
,
which
lead
behind
it
to
the
stable
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
within
twenty
yard
of
each
other
,
and
so
abrupt
be
his
appearance
,
that
it
be
impossible
to
avoid
his
sight
.
<EOS>
Their
eye
instantly
meet
,
and
the
cheek
of
each
be
overspread
with
the
deep
blush
.
<EOS>
He
absolutely
start
,
and
for
a
moment
seem
immoveable
from
surprise
;
but
shortly
recover
himself
,
advanced
towards
the
party
,
and
speak
to
Elizabeth
,
if
not
in
term
of
perfect
composure
,
at
least
of
perfect
civility
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
instinctively
turn
away
;
but
,
stop
on
his
approach
,
receive
his
compliment
with
an
embarrassment
impossible
to
be
overcome
.
<EOS>
have
his
first
appearance
,
or
his
resemblance
to
the
picture
they
have
just
be
examine
,
be
insufficient
to
assure
the
other
two
that
they
now
see
Mr.
Darcy
,
the
gardener
's
expression
of
surprise
,
on
behold
his
master
,
must
immediately
have
tell
it
.
<EOS>
They
stand
a
little
aloof
while
he
be
talk
to
their
niece
,
who
,
astonish
and
confused
,
scarcely
dare
lift
her
eye
to
his
face
,
and
know
not
what
answer
she
return
to
his
civil
enquiry
after
her
family
.
<EOS>
amazed
at
the
alteration
in
his
manner
since
they
last
parted
,
every
sentence
that
he
utter
be
increase
her
embarrassment
;
and
every
idea
of
the
impropriety
of
her
be
find
there
,
recur
to
her
mind
,
the
few
minute
in
which
they
continue
together
,
be
some
of
the
most
uncomfortable
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
nor
do
he
seem
much
more
at
ease
;
when
he
speak
,
his
accent
have
none
of
its
usual
sedateness
;
and
he
repeat
his
enquiry
as
to
the
time
of
her
have
leave
Longbourn
,
and
of
her
stay
in
Derbyshire
,
so
often
,
and
in
so
hurried
a
way
,
as
plainly
speak
the
distraction
of
his
thought
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
,
every
idea
seem
to
fail
him
;
and
,
after
stand
a
few
moment
without
say
a
word
,
he
suddenly
recollect
himself
,
and
take
leave
.
  
<EOS>
the
other
then
join
her
,
and
express
their
admiration
of
his
figure
;
but
Elizabeth
hear
not
a
word
,
and
,
wholly
engross
by
her
own
feeling
,
follow
them
in
silence
.
<EOS>
She
be
overpower
by
shame
and
vexation
.
<EOS>
Her
come
there
be
the
most
unfortunate
,
the
most
ill
-
judge
thing
in
the
world
!
<EOS>
how
strange
must
it
appear
to
him
!
<EOS>
in
what
a
disgraceful
light
may
it
not
strike
so
vain
a
man
!
<EOS>
It
may
seem
as
if
she
have
purposely
throw
herself
in
his
way
again
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
why
do
she
come
?
<EOS>
or
,
why
do
he
thus
come
a
day
before
he
be
expect
?
<EOS>
have
they
be
only
ten
minute
sooner
,
they
should
have
be
beyond
the
reach
of
his
discrimination
,
for
it
be
plain
that
he
be
that
moment
arrive
,
that
moment
alight
from
his
horse
or
his
carriage
.
<EOS>
She
blush
again
and
again
over
the
perverseness
of
the
meeting
.
<EOS>
and
his
behaviour
,
so
strikingly
altered
,
 
what
could
it
mean
?
<EOS>
that
he
should
even
speak
to
her
<EOS>
be
amazing
!
 
<EOS>
but
to
speak
with
such
civility
,
to
enquire
after
her
family
!
<EOS>
never
in
her
life
have
she
see
his
manner
so
little
dignified
,
never
have
he
speak
with
such
gentleness
as
on
this
unexpected
meeting
.
<EOS>
what
a
contrast
do
it
offer
to
his
last
address
in
Rosing
's
Park
,
when
he
put
his
letter
into
her
hand
!
<EOS>
She
know
not
what
to
think
,
nor
how
to
account
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
now
enter
a
beautiful
walk
by
the
side
of
the
water
,
and
every
step
be
bring
forward
a
noble
fall
of
ground
,
or
a
fine
reach
of
the
wood
to
which
they
be
approach
;
but
it
be
some
time
before
Elizabeth
be
sensible
of
any
of
it
;
and
,
though
she
answer
mechanically
to
the
repeat
appeal
of
her
uncle
and
aunt
,
and
seem
to
direct
her
eye
to
such
object
as
they
point
out
,
she
distinguish
no
part
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
Her
thought
be
all
fix
on
that
one
spot
of
Pemberley
House
,
<EOS>
whichever
it
may
be
,
where
Mr.
Darcy
then
be
.
<EOS>
She
long
to
know
what
at
that
moment
be
pass
in
his
mind
;
in
what
manner
he
think
of
her
,
and
whether
,
in
defiance
of
every
thing
,
she
be
still
dear
to
him
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
have
be
civil
,
only
because
he
feel
himself
at
ease
;
yet
there
have
be
_
that
_
in
his
voice
,
which
be
not
like
ease
.
<EOS>
whether
he
have
feel
more
of
pain
or
of
pleasure
in
see
her
,
she
could
not
tell
,
but
he
certainly
have
not
see
her
with
composure
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
the
remark
of
her
companion
on
her
absence
of
mind
rouse
her
,
and
she
feel
the
necessity
of
appear
more
like
herself
.
  
<EOS>
They
enter
the
wood
,
and
bid
adieu
to
the
river
for
a
while
,
ascend
some
of
the
high
ground
;
whence
,
in
spot
where
the
opening
of
the
tree
give
the
eye
power
to
wander
,
be
many
charming
view
of
the
valley
,
the
opposite
hills
,
with
the
long
range
of
wood
overspread
many
,
and
occasionally
part
of
the
stream
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gardiner
express
a
wish
of
go
round
the
whole
Park
,
but
fear
it
may
be
beyond
a
walk
.
<EOS>
with
a
triumphant
smile
,
they
be
tell
,
that
it
be
ten
mile
round
.
<EOS>
It
settle
the
matter
;
and
they
pursue
the
accustomed
circuit
;
which
bring
them
again
,
after
some
time
,
in
a
descent
among
hang
wood
,
to
the
edge
of
the
water
,
in
one
of
its
narrow
part
.
<EOS>
They
cross
it
by
a
simple
bridge
,
in
character
with
the
general
air
of
the
scene
;
it
be
a
spot
less
adorn
than
any
they
have
yet
visit
;
and
the
valley
,
here
contract
into
a
glen
,
allow
room
only
for
the
stream
,
and
a
narrow
walk
amidst
the
rough
coppice
-
wood
which
border
it
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
long
to
explore
its
winding
;
but
when
they
have
cross
the
bridge
,
and
perceive
their
distance
from
the
house
,
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
who
be
not
a
great
walker
,
could
go
no
farther
,
and
think
only
of
return
to
the
carriage
as
quickly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Her
niece
be
,
therefore
,
oblige
to
submit
,
and
they
take
their
way
towards
the
house
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
,
in
the
near
direction
;
but
their
progress
be
slow
,
for
Mr.
Gardiner
,
though
seldom
able
to
indulge
the
taste
,
be
very
fond
of
fishing
,
and
be
so
much
engage
in
watch
the
occasional
appearance
of
some
trout
in
the
water
,
and
talk
to
the
man
about
them
,
that
he
advance
but
little
.
<EOS>
whilst
wander
on
in
this
slow
manner
,
they
be
again
surprised
,
and
Elizabeth
's
astonishment
be
quite
equal
to
what
it
have
be
at
first
,
by
the
sight
of
Mr.
Darcy
approach
them
,
and
at
no
great
distance
.
<EOS>
the
walk
be
here
less
sheltered
than
on
the
other
side
,
allow
them
to
see
him
before
they
meet
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
,
however
astonish
,
be
at
least
more
prepared
for
an
interview
than
before
,
and
resolve
to
appear
and
to
speak
with
calmness
,
if
he
really
intend
to
meet
them
.
<EOS>
for
a
few
moment
,
indeed
,
she
feel
that
he
would
probably
strike
into
some
other
path
.
<EOS>
this
idea
last
while
a
turning
in
the
walk
conceal
him
from
their
view
;
the
turning
past
,
he
be
immediately
before
them
.
<EOS>
with
a
glance
she
see
,
that
he
have
lose
none
of
his
recent
civility
;
and
,
to
imitate
his
politeness
,
she
begin
,
as
they
meet
,
to
admire
the
beauty
of
the
place
;
but
she
have
not
get
beyond
the
word
"
delightful
,
"
and
"
charming
,
"
when
some
unlucky
recollection
obtrude
,
and
she
fancy
that
praise
of
Pemberley
from
her
,
may
be
mischievously
construe
.
<EOS>
Her
colour
change
,
and
she
say
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Gardiner
be
stand
a
little
behind
;
and
on
her
pausing
,
he
ask
her
,
if
she
would
do
him
the
honour
of
introduce
him
to
her
friend
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
stroke
of
civility
for
which
she
be
quite
unprepared
;
and
she
could
hardly
suppress
a
smile
,
at
his
be
now
seek
the
acquaintance
of
some
of
those
very
people
,
against
whom
his
pride
have
revolt
,
in
his
offer
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
what
will
be
his
surprise
,
"
think
she
,
"
when
he
know
who
they
be
!
<EOS>
He
take
them
now
for
people
of
fashion
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
introduction
,
however
,
be
immediately
make
;
and
as
she
name
their
relationship
to
herself
,
she
steal
a
sly
look
at
him
,
to
see
how
he
bear
it
;
and
be
not
without
the
expectation
of
his
decamping
as
fast
as
he
could
from
such
disgraceful
companion
.
<EOS>
that
he
be
_
surprised
_
by
the
connexion
be
evident
;
he
sustain
it
however
with
fortitude
,
and
so
far
from
go
away
,
turn
back
with
them
,
and
enter
into
conversation
with
Mr.
Gardiner
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
could
not
but
be
pleased
,
could
not
but
triumph
.
<EOS>
It
be
consoling
,
that
he
should
know
she
have
some
relation
for
whom
there
be
no
need
to
blush
.
<EOS>
She
listen
most
attentively
to
all
that
pass
between
them
,
and
glory
in
every
expression
,
every
sentence
of
her
uncle
,
which
mark
his
intelligence
,
his
taste
,
or
his
good
manner
.
  
<EOS>
the
conversation
soon
turn
upon
fishing
,
and
she
hear
Mr.
Darcy
invite
him
,
with
the
great
civility
,
to
fish
there
as
often
as
he
choose
,
while
he
continue
in
the
neighbourhood
,
offer
at
the
same
time
to
supply
him
with
fishing
tackle
,
and
point
out
those
part
of
the
stream
where
there
be
usually
most
sport
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
who
be
walk
arm
in
arm
with
Elizabeth
,
give
her
a
look
expressive
of
her
wonder
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
say
nothing
,
but
it
gratify
her
exceedingly
;
the
compliment
must
be
all
for
herself
.
<EOS>
Her
astonishment
,
however
,
be
extreme
;
and
continually
be
she
repeat
,
"
<EOS>
why
be
he
so
altered
?
<EOS>
from
what
can
it
proceed
?
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
for
_
me
_
,
it
can
not
be
for
_
my
_
sake
that
his
manner
be
thus
soften
.
<EOS>
My
reproofs
at
Hunsford
could
not
work
such
a
change
as
this
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
that
he
should
still
love
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
walk
some
time
in
this
way
,
the
two
lady
in
front
,
the
two
gentleman
behind
,
on
resume
their
place
,
after
descend
to
the
brink
of
the
river
for
the
well
inspection
of
some
curious
water
-
plant
,
there
chance
to
be
a
little
alteration
.
<EOS>
It
originate
in
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
who
,
fatigue
by
the
exercise
of
the
morning
,
find
Elizabeth
's
arm
inadequate
to
her
support
,
and
consequently
prefer
her
husband
's
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
take
her
place
by
her
niece
,
and
they
walk
on
together
.
<EOS>
after
a
short
silence
,
the
lady
first
speak
.
<EOS>
She
wish
him
to
know
that
she
have
be
assure
of
his
absence
before
she
come
to
the
place
,
and
accordingly
begin
by
observe
,
that
his
arrival
have
be
very
unexpected
 
"
for
your
housekeeper
,
"
she
add
,
"
inform
us
that
you
would
certainly
not
be
here
till
to
-
morrow
;
and
indeed
,
before
we
leave
Bakewell
,
we
understand
that
you
be
not
immediately
expect
in
the
country
.
"
<EOS>
He
acknowledge
the
truth
of
it
all
;
and
say
that
business
with
his
steward
have
occasion
his
come
forward
a
few
hour
before
the
rest
of
the
party
with
whom
he
have
be
travel
.
<EOS>
"
They
will
join
me
early
to
-
morrow
,
"
he
continue
,
"
and
among
them
be
some
who
will
claim
an
acquaintance
with
you
,
 
Mr.
Bingley
and
his
sister
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
answer
only
by
a
slight
bow
.
<EOS>
Her
thought
be
instantly
drive
back
to
the
time
when
Mr.
Bingley
's
name
have
be
last
mention
between
them
;
and
if
she
may
judge
from
his
complexion
,
_
<EOS>
his
_
mind
be
not
very
differently
engage
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
also
one
other
person
in
the
party
,
"
he
continue
after
a
pause
,
"
who
more
particularly
wish
to
be
know
to
you
,
 
<EOS>
Will
you
allow
me
,
or
do
I
ask
too
much
,
to
introduce
my
sister
to
your
acquaintance
during
your
stay
at
Lambton
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
surprise
of
such
an
application
be
great
indeed
;
it
be
too
great
for
her
to
know
in
what
manner
she
accede
to
it
.
<EOS>
She
immediately
feel
that
whatever
desire
Miss
Darcy
may
have
of
be
acquaint
with
her
,
must
be
the
work
of
her
brother
,
and
without
look
farther
,
it
be
satisfactory
;
it
be
gratify
to
know
that
his
resentment
have
not
make
him
think
really
ill
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
They
now
walk
on
in
silence
;
each
of
them
deep
in
thought
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
not
comfortable
;
that
be
impossible
;
but
she
be
flatter
and
pleased
.
<EOS>
His
wish
of
introduce
his
sister
to
her
,
be
a
compliment
of
the
high
kind
.
<EOS>
They
soon
outstrip
the
other
,
and
when
they
have
reach
the
carriage
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
be
half
a
quarter
of
a
mile
behind
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
ask
her
to
walk
into
the
house
 
<EOS>
but
she
declare
herself
not
tired
,
and
they
stand
together
on
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
at
such
a
time
,
much
may
have
be
say
,
and
silence
be
very
awkward
.
<EOS>
She
want
to
talk
,
but
there
seem
an
embargo
on
every
subject
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
recollect
that
she
have
be
travel
,
and
they
talk
of
Matlock
and
Dove
Dale
with
great
perseverance
.
<EOS>
yet
time
and
her
aunt
move
slowly
 
and
her
patience
and
her
idea
be
nearly
wear
out
before
the
tête
-
à
-
tête
be
over
.
<EOS>
on
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
be
come
up
,
they
be
all
press
to
go
into
the
house
and
take
some
refreshment
;
but
this
be
decline
,
and
they
part
on
each
side
with
the
utmost
politeness
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
hand
the
lady
into
the
carriage
,
and
when
it
drive
off
,
Elizabeth
see
him
walk
slowly
towards
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
observation
of
her
uncle
and
aunt
now
begin
;
and
each
of
them
pronounce
him
to
be
infinitely
superior
to
any
thing
they
have
expect
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
perfectly
well
behave
,
polite
,
and
unassuming
,
"
say
her
uncle
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
_
be
_
something
a
little
stately
in
him
to
be
sure
,
"
reply
her
aunt
,
"
but
it
be
confine
to
his
air
,
and
be
not
unbecoming
.
<EOS>
I
can
now
say
with
the
housekeeper
,
that
though
some
people
may
call
him
proud
,
_
I
_
have
see
nothing
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
never
more
surprised
than
by
his
behaviour
to
us
.
<EOS>
It
be
more
than
civil
;
it
be
really
attentive
;
and
there
be
no
necessity
for
such
attention
.
<EOS>
His
acquaintance
with
Elizabeth
be
very
trifling
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
to
be
sure
,
Lizzy
,
"
say
her
aunt
,
"
he
be
not
so
handsome
as
Wickham
;
or
rather
he
have
not
Wickham
's
countenance
,
for
his
feature
be
perfectly
good
.
<EOS>
but
how
come
you
to
tell
us
that
he
be
so
disagreeable
?
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
excuse
herself
as
well
as
she
could
;
say
that
she
have
like
him
better
when
they
meet
in
Kent
than
before
,
and
that
she
have
never
see
him
so
pleasant
as
this
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
perhaps
he
may
be
a
little
whimsical
in
his
civility
,
"
reply
her
uncle
.
<EOS>
"
Your
great
man
often
be
;
and
therefore
I
shall
not
take
him
at
his
word
about
fishing
,
as
he
may
change
his
mind
another
day
,
and
warn
me
off
his
ground
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
feel
that
they
have
entirely
mistake
his
character
,
but
say
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
from
what
we
have
see
of
him
,
"
continue
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
"
I
really
should
not
have
think
that
he
could
have
behave
in
so
cruel
a
way
by
any
body
,
as
he
have
do
by
poor
Wickham
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
an
ill
-
natured
look
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
there
be
something
pleasing
about
his
mouth
when
he
speak
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
something
of
dignity
in
his
countenance
,
that
would
not
give
one
an
unfavourable
idea
of
his
heart
.
<EOS>
but
to
be
sure
,
the
good
lady
who
shew
us
the
house
,
do
give
him
a
most
flaming
character
!
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
help
laugh
aloud
sometimes
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
a
liberal
master
,
I
suppose
,
and
_
that
_
in
the
eye
of
a
servant
comprehend
every
virtue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
here
feel
herself
call
on
to
say
something
in
vindication
of
his
behaviour
to
Wickham
;
and
therefore
give
them
to
understand
,
in
as
guard
a
manner
as
she
could
,
that
by
what
she
have
hear
from
his
relation
in
Kent
,
his
action
be
capable
of
a
very
different
construction
;
and
that
his
character
be
by
no
means
so
faulty
,
nor
Wickham
's
so
amiable
,
as
they
have
be
consider
in
Hertfordshire
.
<EOS>
in
confirmation
of
this
,
she
relate
the
particular
of
all
the
pecuniary
transaction
in
which
they
have
be
connect
,
without
actually
name
her
authority
,
but
state
it
to
be
such
as
may
be
rely
on
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Gardiner
be
surprised
and
concerned
;
but
as
they
be
now
approach
the
scene
of
her
former
pleasure
,
every
idea
give
way
to
the
charm
of
recollection
;
and
she
be
too
much
engage
in
point
out
to
her
husband
all
the
interesting
spot
in
its
environ
,
to
think
of
any
thing
else
.
<EOS>
fatigue
as
she
have
be
by
the
morning
's
walk
,
they
have
no
sooner
dine
than
she
set
off
again
in
quest
of
her
former
acquaintance
,
and
the
evening
be
spend
in
the
satisfaction
of
an
intercourse
renew
after
many
year
discontinuance
.
  
<EOS>
the
occurrence
of
the
day
be
too
full
of
interest
to
leave
Elizabeth
much
attention
for
any
of
these
new
friend
;
and
she
could
do
nothing
but
think
,
and
think
with
wonder
,
of
Mr.
Darcy
's
civility
,
and
above
all
,
of
his
wish
her
to
be
acquaint
with
his
sister
.
    
<EOS>
Elizabeth
have
settle
it
that
Mr.
Darcy
would
bring
his
sister
to
visit
her
,
the
very
day
after
her
reach
Pemberley
;
and
be
consequently
resolve
not
to
be
out
of
sight
of
the
inn
the
whole
of
that
morning
.
<EOS>
but
her
conclusion
be
false
;
for
on
the
very
morning
after
their
own
arrival
at
Lambton
,
these
visitor
come
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
walk
about
the
place
with
some
of
their
new
friend
,
and
be
just
return
to
the
inn
to
dress
themselves
for
dine
with
the
same
family
,
when
the
sound
of
a
carriage
draw
them
to
a
window
,
and
they
see
a
gentleman
and
lady
in
a
curricle
,
drive
up
the
street
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
immediately
recognise
the
livery
,
guess
what
it
mean
,
and
impart
no
small
degree
of
surprise
to
her
relation
,
by
acquaint
them
with
the
honour
which
she
expect
.
<EOS>
Her
uncle
and
aunt
be
all
amazement
;
and
the
embarrassment
of
her
manner
as
she
speak
,
join
to
the
circumstance
itself
,
and
many
of
the
circumstance
of
the
precede
day
,
open
to
them
a
new
idea
on
the
business
.
<EOS>
nothing
have
ever
suggest
it
before
,
but
they
now
feel
that
there
be
no
other
way
of
account
for
such
attention
from
such
a
quarter
,
than
by
suppose
a
partiality
for
their
niece
.
<EOS>
while
these
newly
-
bear
notion
be
pass
in
their
head
,
the
perturbation
of
Elizabeth
's
feeling
be
every
moment
increase
.
<EOS>
She
be
quite
amazed
at
her
own
discomposure
;
but
amongst
other
cause
of
disquiet
,
she
dread
lest
the
partiality
of
the
brother
should
have
say
too
much
in
her
favour
;
and
more
than
commonly
anxious
to
please
,
she
naturally
suspect
that
every
power
of
please
would
fail
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
retreat
from
the
window
,
fearful
of
be
see
;
and
as
she
walk
up
and
down
the
room
,
endeavour
to
compose
herself
,
see
such
look
of
enquire
surprise
in
her
uncle
and
aunt
,
as
make
every
thing
bad
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Darcy
and
her
brother
appear
,
and
this
formidable
introduction
take
place
.
<EOS>
with
astonishment
do
Elizabeth
see
,
that
her
new
acquaintance
be
at
least
as
much
embarrassed
as
herself
.
<EOS>
since
her
be
at
Lambton
,
she
have
hear
that
Miss
Darcy
be
exceedingly
proud
;
but
the
observation
of
a
very
few
minute
convince
her
,
that
she
be
only
exceedingly
shy
.
<EOS>
She
find
it
difficult
to
obtain
even
a
word
from
her
beyond
a
monosyllable
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Darcy
be
tall
,
and
on
a
large
scale
than
Elizabeth
;
and
,
though
little
more
than
sixteen
,
her
figure
be
form
,
and
her
appearance
womanly
and
graceful
.
<EOS>
She
be
less
handsome
than
her
brother
,
but
there
be
sense
and
good
humour
in
her
face
,
and
her
manner
be
perfectly
unassume
and
gentle
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
,
who
have
expect
to
find
in
her
as
acute
and
unembarrasse
an
observer
as
ever
Mr.
Darcy
have
be
,
be
much
relieve
by
discern
such
different
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
not
be
long
together
,
before
Darcy
tell
her
that
Bingley
be
also
come
to
wait
on
her
;
and
she
have
barely
time
to
express
her
satisfaction
,
and
prepare
for
such
a
visitor
,
when
Bingley
's
quick
step
be
hear
on
the
stair
,
and
in
a
moment
he
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
all
Elizabeth
's
anger
against
him
have
be
long
do
away
;
but
,
have
she
still
feel
any
,
it
could
hardly
have
stand
its
ground
against
the
unaffected
cordiality
with
which
he
express
himself
,
on
see
her
again
.
<EOS>
He
enquire
in
a
friendly
,
though
general
way
,
after
her
family
,
and
look
and
speak
with
the
same
good
-
humoured
ease
that
he
have
ever
do
.
  
<EOS>
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
<EOS>
he
be
scarcely
a
less
interesting
personage
than
to
herself
.
<EOS>
They
have
long
wish
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
the
whole
party
before
them
,
indeed
,
excite
a
lively
attention
.
<EOS>
the
suspicion
which
have
just
arise
of
Mr.
Darcy
and
their
niece
,
direct
their
observation
towards
each
with
an
earnest
,
though
guard
,
enquiry
;
and
they
soon
draw
from
those
enquiry
the
full
conviction
that
one
of
them
at
least
know
what
it
be
to
love
.
<EOS>
of
the
lady
's
sensation
they
remain
a
little
in
doubt
;
but
that
the
gentleman
be
overflow
with
admiration
be
evident
enough
.
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
,
on
her
side
,
have
much
to
do
.
<EOS>
She
want
to
ascertain
the
feeling
of
each
of
her
visitor
,
she
want
to
compose
her
own
,
and
to
make
herself
agreeable
to
all
;
and
in
the
latter
object
,
where
she
fear
most
to
fail
,
she
be
most
sure
of
success
,
for
those
to
whom
she
endeavour
to
give
pleasure
be
prepossess
in
her
favour
.
<EOS>
Bingley
be
ready
,
Georgiana
be
eager
,
and
Darcy
determine
,
to
be
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
in
see
Bingley
,
her
thought
naturally
fly
to
her
sister
;
and
oh
!
<EOS>
how
ardently
do
she
long
to
know
,
whether
any
of
his
be
direct
in
a
like
manner
.
<EOS>
sometimes
she
could
fancy
,
that
he
talk
less
than
on
former
occasion
,
and
once
or
twice
pleased
herself
with
the
notion
that
as
he
look
at
her
,
he
be
try
to
trace
a
resemblance
.
<EOS>
but
,
though
this
may
be
imaginary
,
she
could
not
be
deceive
as
to
his
behaviour
to
Miss
Darcy
,
who
have
be
set
up
as
a
rival
of
Jane
.
<EOS>
no
look
appear
on
either
side
that
speak
particular
regard
.
<EOS>
nothing
occur
between
them
that
could
justify
the
hope
of
his
sister
.
<EOS>
on
this
point
she
be
soon
satisfy
;
and
two
or
three
little
circumstance
occur
ere
they
part
,
which
,
in
her
anxious
interpretation
,
denote
a
recollection
of
Jane
,
not
untinctured
by
tenderness
,
and
a
wish
of
say
more
that
may
lead
to
the
mention
of
her
,
have
he
dare
.
<EOS>
He
observe
to
her
,
at
a
moment
when
the
other
be
talk
together
,
and
<EOS>
in
a
tone
which
have
something
of
real
regret
,
that
it
"
be
a
very
long
time
since
he
have
have
the
pleasure
of
see
her
;
"
and
,
before
she
could
reply
,
he
add
,
"
It
be
above
eight
month
.
<EOS>
We
have
not
meet
since
the
26th
of
November
,
when
we
be
all
dance
together
at
Netherfield
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
pleased
to
find
his
memory
so
exact
;
and
he
afterwards
take
occasion
to
ask
her
,
when
unattende
to
by
any
of
the
rest
,
whether
_
all
_
her
sister
be
at
Longbourn
.
<EOS>
there
be
not
much
in
the
question
,
nor
in
the
precede
remark
,
but
there
be
a
look
and
a
manner
which
give
them
meaning
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
often
that
she
could
turn
her
eye
on
Mr.
Darcy
himself
;
but
,
whenever
she
do
catch
a
glimpse
,
she
see
an
expression
of
general
complaisance
,
and
in
all
that
he
say
,
she
hear
an
accent
so
far
remove
from
hauteur
or
disdain
of
his
companion
,
as
convince
her
that
the
improvement
of
manner
which
she
have
yesterday
witness
,
however
temporary
its
existence
may
prove
,
have
at
least
outlive
one
day
.
<EOS>
when
she
see
him
thus
seek
the
acquaintance
,
and
court
the
good
opinion
of
people
,
with
whom
any
intercourse
a
few
month
ago
would
have
be
a
disgrace
;
when
she
see
him
thus
civil
,
not
only
to
herself
,
but
to
the
very
relation
whom
he
have
openly
disdain
,
and
recollect
their
last
lively
scene
in
Hunsford
Parsonage
,
the
difference
,
the
change
be
so
great
,
and
strike
so
forcibly
on
her
mind
,
that
she
could
hardly
restrain
her
astonishment
from
be
visible
.
<EOS>
never
,
even
in
the
company
of
his
dear
friend
at
Netherfield
,
or
his
dignified
relation
at
Rosings
,
have
she
see
him
so
desirous
to
please
,
so
free
from
self
-
consequence
,
or
unbend
reserve
as
now
,
when
no
importance
could
result
from
the
success
of
his
endeavour
,
and
when
even
the
acquaintance
of
those
to
whom
his
attention
be
address
,
would
draw
down
the
ridicule
and
censure
of
the
lady
both
of
Netherfield
and
Rosings
.
  
<EOS>
Their
visitor
staid
with
them
above
half
an
hour
,
and
when
they
arise
to
depart
,
Mr.
Darcy
call
on
his
sister
to
join
him
in
express
their
wish
of
see
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
and
Miss
Bennet
,
to
dinner
at
Pemberley
,
before
they
leave
the
country
.
<EOS>
Miss
Darcy
,
though
with
a
diffidence
which
mark
her
little
in
the
habit
of
give
invitation
,
readily
obey
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Gardiner
look
at
her
niece
,
desirous
of
know
how
_
she
_
,
whom
the
invitation
most
concerned
,
feel
disposed
as
to
its
acceptance
,
but
Elizabeth
have
turn
away
her
head
.
<EOS>
Presuming
,
however
,
that
this
study
avoidance
speak
rather
a
momentary
embarrassment
,
than
any
dislike
of
the
proposal
,
and
see
in
her
husband
,
who
be
fond
of
society
,
a
perfect
willingness
to
accept
it
,
she
venture
to
engage
for
her
attendance
,
and
the
day
after
the
next
be
fix
on
.
  
<EOS>
Bingley
express
great
pleasure
in
the
certainty
of
see
Elizabeth
again
,
have
still
a
great
deal
to
say
to
her
,
and
many
enquiry
to
make
after
all
their
Hertfordshire
friend
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
,
construe
all
this
into
a
wish
of
hear
her
speak
of
her
sister
,
be
pleased
;
and
on
this
account
,
as
well
as
some
other
,
find
herself
,
when
their
visitor
leave
them
,
capable
of
consider
the
last
half
hour
with
some
satisfaction
,
though
while
it
be
pass
,
the
enjoyment
of
it
have
be
little
.
<EOS>
eager
to
be
alone
,
and
fearful
of
enquiry
or
hint
from
her
uncle
and
aunt
,
she
staid
with
them
only
long
enough
to
hear
their
favourable
opinion
of
Bingley
,
and
then
hurry
away
to
dress
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
have
no
reason
to
fear
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
's
curiosity
;
it
be
not
their
wish
to
force
her
communication
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
that
she
be
much
better
acquaint
with
Mr.
Darcy
than
they
have
before
any
idea
of
;
it
be
evident
that
he
be
very
much
in
love
with
her
.
<EOS>
They
see
much
to
interest
,
but
nothing
to
justify
enquiry
.
  
<EOS>
of
Mr.
Darcy
it
be
now
a
matter
of
anxiety
to
think
well
;
and
,
as
far
as
their
acquaintance
reach
,
there
be
no
fault
to
find
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
be
untouche
by
his
politeness
,
and
have
they
draw
his
character
from
their
own
feeling
,
and
his
servant
's
report
,
without
any
reference
to
any
other
account
,
the
circle
in
Hertfordshire
to
which
he
be
know
,
would
not
have
recognise
it
for
Mr.
Darcy
.
<EOS>
there
be
now
an
interest
,
however
,
in
believe
the
housekeeper
;
and
they
soon
become
sensible
,
that
the
authority
of
a
servant
who
have
know
him
since
he
be
four
year
old
,
and
whose
own
manner
indicate
respectability
,
be
not
to
be
hastily
reject
.
<EOS>
neither
have
any
thing
occur
in
the
intelligence
of
their
Lambton
friend
,
that
could
materially
lessen
its
weight
.
<EOS>
They
have
nothing
to
accuse
him
of
but
pride
;
pride
he
probably
have
,
<EOS>
and
if
not
,
it
would
certainly
be
impute
by
the
inhabitant
of
a
small
market
-
town
,
where
the
family
do
not
visit
.
<EOS>
It
be
acknowledge
,
however
,
that
he
be
a
liberal
man
,
and
do
much
good
among
the
poor
.
  
<EOS>
with
respect
to
Wickham
,
the
traveller
soon
find
that
he
be
not
hold
there
in
much
estimation
;
for
though
the
chief
of
his
concern
,
with
the
son
of
his
patron
,
be
imperfectly
understand
,
it
be
yet
a
well
know
fact
that
,
on
his
quitting
Derbyshire
,
he
have
leave
many
debt
behind
him
,
which
Mr.
Darcy
afterwards
discharge
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Elizabeth
,
her
thought
be
at
Pemberley
this
evening
more
than
the
last
;
and
<EOS>
the
evening
,
though
as
it
pass
it
seem
long
,
be
not
long
enough
to
determine
her
feeling
towards
_
one
_
in
that
mansion
;
and
she
lie
awake
two
whole
hour
,
endeavour
to
make
them
out
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
do
not
hate
him
.
<EOS>
no
;
hatred
have
vanish
long
ago
,
and
she
have
almost
as
long
be
ashamed
of
ever
feel
a
dislike
against
him
,
that
could
be
so
call
.
<EOS>
the
respect
create
by
the
conviction
of
his
valuable
quality
,
though
at
first
unwillingly
admit
,
have
for
some
time
cease
to
be
repugnant
to
her
feeling
;
and
it
be
now
heighten
into
somewhat
of
a
friendly
nature
,
by
the
testimony
so
highly
in
his
favour
,
and
bring
forward
his
disposition
in
so
amiable
a
light
,
which
yesterday
have
produce
.
<EOS>
but
above
all
,
above
respect
and
esteem
,
there
be
a
motive
within
her
of
good
will
which
could
not
be
overlook
.
<EOS>
It
be
gratitude
.
 
<EOS>
Gratitude
,
not
merely
for
have
once
love
her
,
but
for
love
her
still
well
enough
,
to
forgive
all
the
petulance
and
acrimony
of
her
manner
in
reject
him
,
and
all
the
unjust
accusation
accompany
her
rejection
.
<EOS>
He
who
,
she
have
be
persuade
,
would
avoid
her
as
his
great
enemy
,
seem
,
on
this
accidental
meeting
,
most
eager
to
preserve
the
acquaintance
,
and
without
any
indelicate
display
of
regard
,
or
any
peculiarity
of
manner
,
where
their
two
self
only
be
concern
,
be
solicit
the
good
opinion
of
her
friend
,
and
bent
on
make
her
know
to
his
sister
.
<EOS>
such
a
change
in
a
man
of
so
much
pride
,
excite
not
only
astonishment
but
gratitude
 
for
to
love
,
ardent
love
,
it
must
be
attribute
;
and
as
such
its
impression
on
her
be
of
a
sort
to
be
encourage
,
as
by
no
mean
unplease
,
though
it
could
not
be
exactly
define
.
<EOS>
She
respect
,
she
esteem
,
she
be
grateful
to
him
,
she
feel
a
real
interest
in
his
welfare
;
and
she
only
want
to
know
how
far
she
wish
that
welfare
to
depend
upon
herself
,
and
how
far
it
would
be
for
the
happiness
of
both
that
she
should
employ
the
power
,
which
her
fancy
tell
her
she
still
possess
,
of
bring
on
the
renewal
of
his
address
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
be
settle
in
the
evening
,
between
the
aunt
and
niece
,
that
such
a
strike
civility
as
Miss
Darcy
's
,
in
come
to
them
on
the
very
day
of
her
arrival
at
Pemberley
,
for
she
have
reach
it
only
to
a
late
breakfast
,
ought
to
be
imitate
,
though
it
could
not
be
equal
,
by
some
exertion
of
politeness
on
their
side
;
and
,
consequently
,
that
it
would
be
highly
expedient
to
wait
on
her
at
Pemberley
the
following
morning
.
<EOS>
They
be
,
therefore
,
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
pleased
,
though
,
when
she
ask
herself
the
reason
,
she
have
very
little
to
say
in
reply
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gardiner
leave
them
soon
after
breakfast
.
<EOS>
the
fishing
scheme
have
be
renew
the
day
before
,
and
a
positive
engagement
make
of
his
meeting
some
of
the
gentleman
at
Pemberley
by
noon
.
    
<EOS>
convince
as
Elizabeth
<EOS>
now
be
that
Miss
Bingley
's
dislike
of
her
have
originate
in
jealousy
<EOS>
,
she
could
not
help
feel
how
very
unwelcome
her
appearance
at
Pemberley
must
be
to
her
,
and
be
curious
to
know
with
how
much
civility
on
that
lady
's
side
,
the
acquaintance
would
now
be
renew
.
  
<EOS>
on
reach
the
house
,
they
be
shew
through
the
hall
into
the
saloon
,
whose
northern
aspect
render
it
delightful
for
summer
.
<EOS>
Its
window
open
to
the
ground
,
admit
a
most
refreshing
view
of
the
high
woody
hill
behind
the
house
,
and
of
the
beautiful
oak
and
spanish
chesnut
which
be
scatter
over
the
intermediate
lawn
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
room
they
be
receive
by
Miss
Darcy
,
who
be
sit
there
with
Mrs.
Hurst
and
Miss
Bingley
,
and
the
lady
with
whom
she
live
in
London
.
<EOS>
Georgiana
's
reception
of
them
be
very
civil
;
but
attend
with
all
that
embarrassment
which
,
though
proceed
from
shyness
and
the
fear
of
do
wrong
,
would
easily
give
to
those
who
feel
themselves
inferior
,
the
belief
of
her
be
proud
and
reserve
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Gardiner
and
her
niece
,
however
,
do
her
justice
,
and
pity
her
.
  
<EOS>
by
Mrs.
Hurst
and
Miss
Bingley
,
they
be
notice
only
by
a
curtsey
;
and
on
their
be
seat
,
a
pause
,
awkward
as
such
pause
must
always
be
,
succeed
for
a
few
moment
.
<EOS>
It
be
first
break
by
Mrs.
Annesley
,
a
genteel
,
agreeable
-
look
woman
,
whose
endeavour
to
introduce
some
kind
of
discourse
,
prove
her
to
be
more
truly
well
breed
than
either
of
the
other
;
and
between
her
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
with
occasional
help
from
Elizabeth
,
the
conversation
be
carry
on
.
<EOS>
Miss
Darcy
look
as
if
she
wish
for
courage
enough
to
join
in
it
;
and
sometimes
do
venture
a
short
sentence
,
when
there
be
least
danger
of
its
be
hear
.
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
soon
see
that
she
be
herself
closely
watch
by
Miss
Bingley
,
and
that
she
could
not
speak
a
word
,
especially
to
Miss
Darcy
,
without
call
her
attention
.
<EOS>
this
observation
would
not
have
prevent
her
from
try
to
talk
to
the
latter
,
have
they
not
be
seat
at
an
inconvenient
distance
;
but
she
be
not
sorry
to
be
spare
the
necessity
of
say
much
.
<EOS>
Her
own
thought
be
employ
her
.
<EOS>
She
expect
every
moment
that
some
of
the
gentleman
would
enter
the
room
.
<EOS>
She
wish
,
she
fear
that
the
master
of
the
house
may
be
amongst
them
;
and
whether
she
wish
or
fear
it
most
,
she
could
scarcely
determine
.
<EOS>
after
sit
in
this
manner
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
without
hear
Miss
Bingley
's
voice
,
Elizabeth
be
rouse
by
receive
from
her
a
cold
enquiry
after
the
health
of
her
family
.
<EOS>
She
answer
with
equal
indifference
and
brevity
,
and
the
other
say
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
variation
which
their
visit
afford
be
produce
by
the
entrance
of
servant
with
cold
meat
,
cake
,
and
a
variety
of
all
the
fine
fruit
in
season
;
but
this
do
not
take
place
till
after
many
a
significant
look
and
smile
from
Mrs.
Annesley
to
Miss
Darcy
have
be
give
,
to
remind
her
of
her
post
.
<EOS>
there
be
now
employment
for
the
whole
party
;
for
though
they
could
not
all
talk
,
they
could
all
eat
;
and
the
beautiful
pyramid
of
grape
,
nectarine
,
and
peach
,
soon
collect
them
round
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
while
thus
engage
,
Elizabeth
have
a
fair
opportunity
of
decide
whether
she
most
fear
or
wish
for
the
appearance
of
Mr.
Darcy
,
by
the
feeling
which
prevail
on
his
enter
the
room
;
and
then
,
though
but
a
moment
before
she
have
believe
her
wish
to
predominate
,
she
begin
to
regret
that
he
come
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
be
some
time
with
Mr.
Gardiner
,
who
,
with
two
or
three
other
gentleman
from
the
house
,
be
engage
by
the
river
,
and
have
leave
him
only
on
learn
that
the
lady
of
the
family
intend
a
visit
to
Georgiana
that
morning
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
do
he
appear
,
than
Elizabeth
wisely
resolve
to
be
perfectly
easy
and
unembarrassed
;
 
a
resolution
the
more
necessary
to
be
make
,
but
perhaps
not
the
more
easily
keep
,
because
she
see
that
the
suspicion
of
the
whole
party
be
awaken
against
them
,
and
that
there
be
scarcely
an
eye
which
do
not
watch
his
behaviour
when
he
first
come
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
in
no
countenance
be
attentive
curiosity
so
strongly
marked
as
in
Miss
Bingley
's
,
in
spite
of
the
smile
which
overspread
her
face
whenever
she
speak
to
one
of
its
object
;
for
jealousy
have
not
yet
make
her
desperate
,
and
her
attention
to
Mr.
Darcy
be
by
no
mean
over
.
<EOS>
Miss
Darcy
,
on
her
brother
's
entrance
,
exert
herself
much
more
to
talk
;
and
Elizabeth
see
that
he
be
anxious
for
his
sister
and
herself
to
get
acquaint
,
and
forward
,
as
much
as
possible
,
every
attempt
at
conversation
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
Miss
Bingley
see
all
this
likewise
;
and
,
in
the
imprudence
of
anger
,
take
the
first
opportunity
of
say
,
with
sneer
civility
,
  
"
Pray
,
Miss
Eliza
,
be
not
the
shire
militia
remove
from
Meryton
?
<EOS>
They
must
be
a
great
loss
to
_
your
_
family
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
Darcy
's
presence
she
dare
not
mention
Wickham
's
name
;
but
Elizabeth
instantly
comprehend
that
he
be
uppermost
in
her
thought
;
and
the
various
recollection
connect
with
him
give
her
a
moment
's
distress
;
but
,
exert
herself
vigorously
to
repel
the
ill
-
natured
attack
<EOS>
,
she
presently
answer
the
question
in
a
tolerably
disengaged
tone
.
<EOS>
while
she
speak
,
an
involuntary
glance
shew
her
Darcy
with
an
heighten
complexion
,
earnestly
look
at
her
,
and
his
sister
overcome
with
confusion
,
and
unable
to
lift
up
her
eye
.
<EOS>
have
Miss
Bingley
know
what
pain
she
be
then
give
her
beloved
friend
,
she
undoubtedly
would
have
refrain
from
the
hint
;
but
she
have
merely
intend
to
discompose
Elizabeth
,
by
bring
forward
the
idea
of
a
man
to
whom
she
believe
her
partial
,
to
make
her
betray
a
sensibility
which
may
injure
her
in
Darcy
's
opinion
,
and
perhaps
to
remind
the
latter
of
all
the
folly
and
absurdity
,
by
which
some
part
of
her
family
be
connect
with
that
corps
.
<EOS>
not
a
syllable
have
ever
reach
her
of
Miss
Darcy
's
meditate
elopement
.
<EOS>
to
no
creature
have
it
be
reveal
,
where
secresy
be
possible
,
except
to
Elizabeth
;
and
from
all
Bingley
's
connection
<EOS>
her
brother
be
particularly
anxious
to
conceal
it
,
from
that
very
wish
which
Elizabeth
have
long
ago
attribute
to
him
,
of
their
become
hereafter
her
own
.
<EOS>
He
have
certainly
form
such
a
plan
,
and
without
mean
that
it
should
affect
his
endeavour
to
separate
him
from
Miss
Bennet
,
it
be
probable
that
it
may
add
something
to
his
lively
concern
for
the
welfare
of
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
's
collect
behaviour
,
however
,
soon
quiet
his
emotion
;
and
as
Miss
Bingley
,
vexed
and
disappointed
,
dare
not
approach
nearer
to
Wickham
,
Georgiana
also
recover
in
time
,
though
not
enough
to
be
able
to
speak
any
more
.
<EOS>
Her
brother
,
whose
eye
she
fear
to
meet
,
scarcely
recollect
her
interest
in
the
affair
,
and
the
very
circumstance
which
have
be
design
to
turn
his
thought
from
Elizabeth
,
seem
to
have
fix
them
on
her
more
,
and
more
cheerfully
.
  
<EOS>
Their
visit
do
not
continue
long
after
the
question
and
answer
above
-
mention
;
and
while
Mr.
Darcy
be
attend
them
to
their
carriage
,
Miss
Bingley
be
vent
her
feeling
in
criticism
on
Elizabeth
's
person
,
behaviour
,
and
dress
.
<EOS>
but
Georgiana
would
not
join
her
.
<EOS>
Her
brother
's
recommendation
be
enough
to
ensure
her
favour
:
his
judgment
could
not
err
,
and
he
have
speak
in
such
term
of
Elizabeth
,
as
to
leave
Georgiana
without
the
power
of
find
her
otherwise
than
lovely
and
amiable
.
<EOS>
when
Darcy
return
to
the
saloon
,
Miss
Bingley
could
not
help
repeat
to
him
some
part
of
what
she
have
be
say
to
his
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
very
ill
Eliza
Bennet
look
this
morning
,
Mr.
Darcy
,
"
she
cry
;
"
I
never
in
my
life
see
any
one
so
much
alter
as
she
be
since
the
winter
.
<EOS>
She
be
grow
so
brown
and
coarse
!
<EOS>
Louisa
and
I
be
agree
that
we
should
not
have
know
her
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
however
little
Mr.
Darcy
may
have
like
such
an
address
,
he
content
himself
with
coolly
reply
,
that
he
perceive
no
other
alteration
than
her
be
rather
tan
,
 
no
miraculous
consequence
of
travel
in
the
summer
.
  
<EOS>
"
for
my
own
part
,
"
she
rejoin
,
"
I
must
confess
that
I
never
could
see
any
beauty
in
her
.
<EOS>
Her
face
be
too
thin
;
her
complexion
have
no
brilliancy
;
and
her
feature
be
not
at
all
handsome
.
<EOS>
Her
nose
want
character
;
there
be
nothing
mark
in
its
line
.
<EOS>
Her
tooth
be
tolerable
,
but
not
out
of
the
common
way
;
and
as
for
her
eye
,
which
have
sometimes
be
call
so
fine
,
I
never
could
perceive
any
thing
extraordinary
in
them
.
<EOS>
They
have
a
sharp
,
shrewish
look
,
which
I
do
not
like
at
all
;
and
in
her
air
altogether
,
there
be
a
self
-
sufficiency
without
fashion
,
which
be
intolerable
.
"
  
<EOS>
persuade
as
Miss
Bingley
be
that
Darcy
admire
Elizabeth
,
this
be
not
the
good
method
of
recommend
herself
;
but
angry
people
be
not
always
wise
;
and
in
see
him
at
last
look
somewhat
nettle
,
she
have
all
the
success
she
expect
.
<EOS>
He
be
resolutely
silent
however
;
and
,
from
a
determination
of
make
him
speak
,
she
continue
,
  
"
<EOS>
I
remember
,
when
we
first
know
her
in
Hertfordshire
,
how
amazed
we
all
be
to
find
that
she
be
a
reputed
beauty
;
and
I
particularly
recollect
your
say
one
night
,
after
they
have
be
dine
at
Netherfield
,
"
_
<EOS>
She
_
<EOS>
a
beauty
!
 
<EOS>
I
should
as
soon
call
her
mother
a
wit
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
afterwards
she
seem
to
improve
on
you
,
and
I
believe
you
think
her
rather
pretty
at
one
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
reply
Darcy
,
who
could
contain
himself
no
longer
,
"
but
_
that
_
be
only
when
I
first
know
her
,
<EOS>
for
it
be
many
month
since
I
have
consider
her
as
one
of
the
handsome
woman
of
my
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
then
go
away
,
and
Miss
Bingley
be
leave
to
all
the
satisfaction
of
have
force
him
to
say
what
give
no
one
any
pain
but
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Gardiner
and
Elizabeth
talk
of
all
that
have
occur
,
during
their
visit
,
as
they
return
,
except
what
have
particularly
interest
them
both
.
<EOS>
the
look
and
behaviour
of
every
body
they
have
see
be
discuss
,
except
of
the
person
who
have
mostly
engage
their
attention
.
<EOS>
They
talk
of
his
sister
,
his
friend
,
his
house
,
his
fruit
,
of
every
thing
but
himself
;
yet
Elizabeth
be
long
to
know
what
Mrs.
Gardiner
think
of
him
,
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
would
have
be
highly
gratify
by
her
niece
's
begin
the
subject
.
    
<EOS>
Elizabeth
have
be
a
good
deal
disappoint
in
not
find
a
letter
from
Jane
,
on
their
first
arrival
at
Lambton
;
and
this
disappointment
have
be
renew
on
each
of
the
morning
that
have
now
be
spend
there
;
but
on
the
third
,
her
repining
be
over
,
and
her
sister
justify
by
the
receipt
of
two
letter
from
her
at
once
,
on
one
of
which
be
mark
that
it
have
be
missent
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
not
surprised
at
it
,
as
Jane
have
write
the
direction
remarkably
ill
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
just
be
prepare
to
walk
as
the
letter
come
in
;
and
her
uncle
and
aunt
,
leave
her
to
enjoy
them
in
quiet
,
set
off
by
themselves
.
<EOS>
the
one
missent
must
be
first
attend
to
;
it
have
be
write
five
day
ago
.
<EOS>
the
beginning
contain
an
account
of
all
their
little
party
and
engagement
,
with
such
news
as
the
country
afford
;
but
the
latter
half
,
which
be
date
a
day
later
,
and
write
in
evident
agitation
,
give
more
important
intelligence
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
this
effect
:
  
"
since
write
the
above
,
dear
Lizzy
,
something
have
occur
of
a
most
unexpected
and
serious
nature
;
but
I
be
afraid
of
alarm
you
 
be
assure
that
we
be
all
well
.
<EOS>
what
I
have
to
say
relate
to
poor
Lydia
.
<EOS>
an
express
come
at
twelve
last
night
,
just
as
we
be
all
go
to
bed
,
from
Colonel
Forster
,
to
inform
us
that
she
be
go
off
to
Scotland
with
one
of
his
officer
;
to
own
the
truth
,
with
Wickham
!
 
<EOS>
imagine
our
surprise
.
<EOS>
to
Kitty
,
however
,
it
do
not
seem
so
wholly
unexpected
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
,
very
sorry
.
<EOS>
so
imprudent
a
match
on
both
side
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
willing
to
hope
the
good
,
and
that
his
character
have
be
misunderstood
.
<EOS>
thoughtless
and
indiscreet
<EOS>
I
can
easily
believe
him
,
but
this
step
(
and
let
us
rejoice
over
it
)
mark
nothing
bad
at
heart
.
<EOS>
His
choice
be
disintereste
at
least
,
for
he
must
know
my
father
can
give
her
nothing
.
<EOS>
Our
poor
mother
be
sadly
grieve
.
<EOS>
My
father
bear
it
better
.
<EOS>
how
thankful
be
I
,
<EOS>
that
we
never
let
them
know
what
have
be
say
against
him
;
we
must
forget
it
ourselves
.
<EOS>
They
be
off
Saturday
night
about
twelve
,
as
be
conjecture
,
but
be
not
miss
till
yesterday
morning
at
eight
.
<EOS>
the
express
be
send
off
directly
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Lizzy
,
they
must
have
pass
within
ten
mile
of
us
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Forster
give
us
reason
to
expect
him
here
soon
.
<EOS>
Lydia
leave
a
few
line
for
his
wife
,
inform
her
of
their
intention
.
<EOS>
I
must
conclude
,
for
I
can
not
be
long
from
my
poor
mother
.
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
you
will
not
be
able
to
make
it
out
,
but
I
hardly
know
what
I
have
write
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
without
allow
herself
time
for
consideration
,
and
scarcely
know
what
she
feel
,
Elizabeth
on
finish
this
letter
,
instantly
seize
the
other
,
and
open
it
with
the
utmost
impatience
,
read
as
follow
:
it
have
be
write
a
day
later
than
the
conclusion
of
the
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
by
this
time
,
my
dear
sister
,
you
have
receive
my
hurried
letter
;
I
wish
this
may
be
more
intelligible
,
but
though
not
confine
for
time
,
my
head
be
so
bewildered
that
I
can
not
answer
for
be
coherent
.
<EOS>
Dearest
Lizzy
,
I
hardly
know
what
I
would
write
,
but
I
have
bad
news
for
you
,
and
it
can
not
be
delay
.
<EOS>
imprudent
as
a
marriage
between
Mr.
Wickham
and
our
poor
Lydia
would
be
,
we
be
now
anxious
to
be
assure
it
have
take
place
,
<EOS>
for
there
be
but
too
much
reason
to
fear
they
be
not
go
to
Scotland
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Forster
come
yesterday
,
have
leave
Brighton
the
day
before
,
not
many
hour
after
the
express
.
<EOS>
though
Lydia
's
short
letter
to
Mrs.
F.
give
them
to
understand
that
they
be
go
to
Gretna
Green
,
something
be
drop
by
Denny
express
his
belief
that
W.
never
intend
to
go
there
,
or
to
marry
Lydia
at
all
,
which
be
repeat
to
Colonel
F.
who
instantly
take
the
alarm
,
set
off
from
B.
intend
to
trace
their
route
.
<EOS>
He
do
trace
them
easily
to
Clapham
,
but
no
farther
;
for
on
enter
that
place
they
remove
into
a
hackney
-
coach
and
dismiss
the
chaise
that
bring
them
from
Epsom
.
<EOS>
all
that
be
know
after
this
be
,
that
they
be
see
to
continue
the
London
road
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
think
.
<EOS>
after
make
every
possible
enquiry
on
that
side
London
,
Colonel
F.
come
on
into
Hertfordshire
,
anxiously
renew
them
at
all
the
turnpike
,
and
at
the
inn
in
Barnet
and
Hatfield
,
but
without
any
success
,
no
such
people
have
be
see
to
pass
through
.
<EOS>
with
the
kind
concern
he
come
on
to
Longbourn
,
and
break
his
apprehension
to
us
in
a
manner
most
creditable
to
his
heart
.
<EOS>
I
be
sincerely
grieve
for
him
and
Mrs.
F.
but
no
one
can
throw
any
blame
on
them
.
<EOS>
Our
distress
,
my
dear
Lizzy
,
be
very
great
.
<EOS>
My
father
and
mother
believe
the
bad
,
but
I
can
not
think
so
ill
of
him
.
<EOS>
many
circumstance
may
make
it
more
eligible
for
them
to
be
marry
privately
in
town
than
to
pursue
their
first
plan
;
and
even
if
_
he
_
could
form
such
a
design
against
a
young
woman
of
Lydia
's
connection
,
which
be
not
likely
,
can
I
suppose
her
so
lose
to
every
thing
?
 
<EOS>
impossible
.
<EOS>
I
grieve
to
find
,
however
,
that
Colonel
F.
be
not
disposed
to
depend
upon
their
marriage
;
he
shake
his
head
when
I
express
my
hope
,
and
say
he
fear
W.
be
not
a
man
to
be
trust
.
<EOS>
My
poor
mother
be
really
ill
and
keep
her
room
.
<EOS>
Could
she
exert
herself
it
would
be
well
,
but
this
be
not
to
be
expect
;
and
as
to
my
father
,
I
never
in
my
life
see
him
so
affected
.
<EOS>
Poor
Kitty
have
anger
for
have
conceal
their
attachment
;
but
as
it
be
a
matter
of
confidence
one
can
not
wonder
.
<EOS>
I
be
truly
glad
,
dear
Lizzy
,
that
you
have
be
spare
something
of
these
distress
scene
;
but
now
as
the
first
shock
be
over
,
shall
I
own
that
I
long
for
your
return
?
<EOS>
I
be
not
so
selfish
,
however
,
as
to
press
for
it
,
if
inconvenient
.
<EOS>
Adieu
.
<EOS>
I
take
up
my
pen
again
to
do
<EOS>
,
what
I
have
just
tell
you
I
would
not
,
but
circumstance
be
such
,
that
I
can
not
help
earnestly
beg
you
all
to
come
here
,
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
dear
uncle
and
aunt
<EOS>
so
well
,
that
I
be
not
afraid
of
request
it
,
though
I
have
still
something
more
to
ask
of
the
former
.
<EOS>
My
father
be
go
to
London
with
Colonel
Forster
instantly
,
to
try
to
discover
her
.
<EOS>
what
he
mean
to
do
,
I
be
sure
I
know
not
;
but
his
excessive
distress
will
not
allow
him
to
pursue
any
measure
in
the
good
and
safe
way
,
and
Colonel
Forster
be
oblige
to
be
at
Brighton
again
to
-
morrow
evening
.
<EOS>
in
such
an
exigence
my
uncle
's
advice
and
assistance
would
be
every
thing
in
the
world
;
he
will
immediately
comprehend
what
I
must
feel
,
and
I
rely
upon
his
goodness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
where
,
where
be
my
uncle
?
<EOS>
"
cry
Elizabeth
,
dart
from
her
seat
as
she
finish
the
letter
,
in
eagerness
to
follow
him
,
without
lose
a
moment
of
the
time
so
precious
;
but
as
she
reach
the
door
,
it
be
open
by
a
servant
,
and
Mr.
Darcy
appear
.
<EOS>
Her
pale
face
and
impetuous
manner
make
him
start
,
and
before
he
could
recover
himself
enough
to
speak
,
she
,
in
whose
mind
every
idea
be
supersede
by
Lydia
's
situation
,
hastily
exclaim
,
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
but
I
must
leave
you
.
<EOS>
I
must
find
Mr.
Gardiner
this
moment
,
on
business
that
can
not
be
delay
;
I
have
not
an
instant
to
lose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
God
!
<EOS>
what
be
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
cry
he
,
with
more
feeling
than
politeness
;
then
recollect
himself
,
"
I
will
not
detain
you
a
minute
,
but
let
me
,
or
let
the
servant
,
go
after
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
.
<EOS>
You
be
not
well
enough
;
 
you
can
not
go
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
hesitate
,
but
her
knee
tremble
under
her
,
and
she
feel
how
little
would
be
gain
by
her
attempt
to
pursue
them
.
<EOS>
call
back
the
servant
,
therefore
,
she
commission
him
,
though
in
so
breathless
an
accent
as
make
her
almost
unintelligible
,
to
fetch
his
master
and
mistress
home
,
instantly
.
  
<EOS>
on
his
quit
the
room
,
she
sit
down
,
unable
to
support
herself
,
and
look
so
miserably
ill
,
that
it
be
impossible
for
Darcy
to
leave
her
,
or
to
refrain
from
say
,
in
a
tone
of
gentleness
and
commiseration
,
"
let
me
call
your
maid
.
<EOS>
be
there
nothing
you
could
take
,
to
give
you
present
relief
?
 
<EOS>
a
glass
of
wine
;
 
<EOS>
shall
I
get
you
one
?
 
<EOS>
You
be
very
ill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
thank
you
;
"
she
reply
,
endeavour
to
recover
herself
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
the
matter
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
be
quite
well
.
<EOS>
I
be
only
distressed
by
some
dreadful
news
which
I
have
just
receive
from
Longbourn
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
burst
into
tear
as
she
allude
to
it
,
and
for
a
few
minute
could
not
speak
another
word
.
<EOS>
darcy
,
in
wretched
suspense
,
could
only
say
something
indistinctly
of
his
concern
,
and
observe
her
in
compassionate
silence
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
she
speak
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
have
a
letter
from
Jane
,
with
such
dreadful
news
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
conceal
from
any
one
.
<EOS>
My
young
sister
have
leave
all
her
friend
 
have
elope
;
 
have
throw
herself
into
the
power
of
 
of
Mr.
Wickham
.
<EOS>
They
be
go
off
together
from
Brighton
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
<EOS>
_
know
him
too
well
to
doubt
the
rest
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
money
,
no
connection
,
nothing
that
can
tempt
him
to
 
<EOS>
she
be
lose
for
ever

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Darcy
be
fix
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
when
I
consider
,
"
she
add
,
in
a
yet
more
agitated
voice
,
"
that
_
I
_
may
have
prevent
it
!
 
<EOS>
_

I

have
I
but
explain
some
part
of
it
only
 
some
part
of
what
I
learn
,
to
my
own
family
!
<EOS>
have
his
character
be
know
,
this
could
not
have
happen
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
all
,
all
too
late
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
grieve
,
indeed
,
"
cry
Darcy
;
"
grieve
 
shocked
.
<EOS>
but
be
it
certain
,
absolutely
certain
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
!
 
<EOS>
They
leave
Brighton
together
on
Sunday
night
,
and
be
trace
almost
to
London
,
but
not
beyond
;
they
be
certainly
not
go
to
Scotland
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
what
have
be
do
,
what
have
be
attempt

to
recover
her

"
  
<EOS>
"
My
father

to
London

Jane

write
to
beg
my
uncle
's
immediate
assistance
,
and
we
shall
be
off
,
I
hope
,
in
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
but
nothing
can
be
do
;
I
know
very
well
that
nothing
can
be
do

<EOS>
how
be
such
a
man
to
be
work
on
?
<EOS>
how
be
they
even
to
be
discover
?
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
small
hope

<EOS>
It
be
every
way
horrible
!
"
  
<EOS>
Darcy
shake
his
head
in
silent
acquiesence
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
_
my
_
eye
be
open
to
his
real
character

<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
have
I
know
what
I
ought
,
what
I
dare
,
to
do
!
<EOS>
but
I
know
not
 
I
be
afraid
of
do
too
much
.
<EOS>
wretched
,
wretched
,
mistake
!
"
  
<EOS>
Darcy
make
no
answer
.
<EOS>
He
seem
scarcely
to
hear
her
,
and
be
walk
up
and
down
the
room
in
earnest
meditation
;
his
brow
contract
,
his
air
gloomy
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
soon
observe
,
and
instantly
understand
it
.
<EOS>
Her
power
be
sink
;
every
thing
_
must
_
sink
under
such
a
proof
of
family
weakness
,
such
an
assurance
of
the
deep
disgrace
.
<EOS>
She
could
neither
wonder
nor
condemn
,
but
the
belief
of
his
self
-
conquest
bring
nothing
consolatory
to
her
bosom
,
afford
no
palliation
of
her
distress
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
on
the
contrary
,
exactly
calculated
to
make
her
understand
her
own
wish
;
and
never
have
she
so
honestly
feel
that
she
could
have
love
him
,
as
now
,
when
all
love
must
be
vain
.
  
<EOS>
but
self
,
though
it
would
intrude
,
could
not
engross
her
.
<EOS>
Lydia
 
<EOS>
the
humiliation
,
the
misery
<EOS>
,
she
be
bring
on
them
all
,
soon
swallow
up
every
private
care
;
and
cover
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
,
Elizabeth
be
soon
lose
to
every
thing
else
;
and
,
after
a
pause
of
several
minute
,
be
only
recall
to
a
sense
of
her
situation
by
the
voice
of
her
companion
,
who
,
in
a
manner
,
which
though
it
speak
compassion
,
speak
likewise
restraint
,
say
,
"
I
be
afraid
you
have
be
long
desire
my
absence
,
nor
have
I
any
thing
to
plead
in
excuse
of
my
stay
,
but
real
,
though
unavaile
,
concern
.
<EOS>
Would
to
heaven
that
any
thing
could
be
either
say
or
do
on
my
part
,
that
may
offer
consolation
to
such
distress
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
torment
you
with
vain
wish
,
which
may
seem
purposely
to
ask
for
your
thank
.
<EOS>
this
unfortunate
affair
will
,
I
fear
,
prevent
my
sister
be
have
the
pleasure
of
see
you
at
Pemberley
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
.
<EOS>
be
so
kind
as
to
apologize
for
us
to
Miss
Darcy
.
<EOS>
say
that
urgent
business
call
us
home
immediately
.
<EOS>
conceal
the
unhappy
truth
as
long
as
it
be
possible
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
can
not
be
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
readily
assure
her
of
his
secrecy
 
again
express
his
sorrow
for
her
distress
,
wish
it
a
happy
conclusion
than
there
be
at
present
reason
to
hope
,
and
leave
his
compliment
for
her
relation
,
with
only
one
serious
,
part
,
look
,
go
away
.
  
<EOS>
as
he
quit
the
room
,
Elizabeth
feel
how
improbable
it
be
that
they
should
ever
see
each
other
again
on
such
term
of
cordiality
as
have
mark
their
several
meeting
in
Derbyshire
;
and
as
she
throw
a
retrospective
glance
over
the
whole
of
their
acquaintance
,
so
full
of
contradiction
and
variety
,
sigh
at
the
perverseness
of
those
feeling
which
would
now
have
promote
its
continuance
,
and
would
formerly
have
rejoice
in
its
termination
.
  
<EOS>
if
gratitude
and
esteem
be
good
foundation
of
affection
,
Elizabeth
's
change
of
sentiment
will
be
neither
improbable
nor
faulty
.
<EOS>
but
if
otherwise
,
if
the
regard
spring
from
such
source
be
unreasonable
or
unnatural
,
in
comparison
of
what
be
so
often
describe
as
arise
on
a
first
interview
with
its
object
,
and
even
before
two
word
have
be
exchange
,
nothing
can
be
say
in
her
defence
,
except
that
she
have
give
somewhat
of
a
trial
to
the
latter
method
,
in
her
partiality
for
Wickham
,
and
that
its
ill
-
success
may
perhaps
authorise
her
to
seek
the
other
less
interesting
mode
of
attachment
.
<EOS>
be
that
as
it
may
,
she
see
him
go
with
regret
;
and
in
this
early
example
of
what
Lydia
's
infamy
must
produce
,
find
additional
anguish
as
she
reflect
on
that
wretched
business
.
<EOS>
never
,
since
read
Jane
's
second
letter
,
have
she
entertain
a
hope
of
Wickham
's
meaning
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
no
one
but
Jane
,
she
think
,
could
flatter
herself
with
such
an
expectation
.
<EOS>
Surprise
be
the
least
of
her
feeling
on
this
developement
.
<EOS>
while
the
content
of
the
first
letter
remain
on
her
mind
,
she
be
all
surprise
 
<EOS>
all
astonishment
that
Wickham
should
marry
a
girl
,
whom
it
be
impossible
<EOS>
he
could
marry
for
money
;
and
how
Lydia
could
ever
have
attach
him
,
have
appear
incomprehensible
.
<EOS>
but
now
it
be
all
too
natural
.
<EOS>
for
such
an
attachment
as
this
,
she
may
have
sufficient
charm
;
and
though
she
do
not
suppose
Lydia
to
be
deliberately
engage
in
an
elopement
,
without
the
intention
of
marriage
,
she
have
no
difficulty
in
believe
that
neither
her
virtue
nor
her
understanding
would
preserve
her
from
fall
an
easy
prey
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
never
perceive
,
while
the
regiment
be
in
Hertfordshire
,
that
Lydia
have
any
partiality
for
him
,
but
she
be
convince
that
Lydia
have
want
only
encouragement
to
attach
herself
to
any
body
.
<EOS>
sometimes
one
officer
,
sometimes
another
have
be
her
favourite
,
as
their
attention
raise
them
in
her
opinion
.
<EOS>
Her
affection
have
be
continually
fluctuate
,
but
never
without
an
object
.
<EOS>
the
mischief
of
neglect
and
mistaken
indulgence
towards
such
a
girl
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
acutely
do
she
now
feel
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
wild
to
be
at
home
 
to
hear
,
to
see
,
to
be
upon
the
spot
,
to
share
with
Jane
in
the
care
that
must
now
fall
wholly
upon
her
,
in
a
family
so
deranged
;
a
father
absent
,
a
mother
incapable
of
exertion
,
and
require
constant
attendance
;
and
though
almost
persuade
that
nothing
could
be
do
for
Lydia
,
her
uncle
's
interference
seem
of
the
utmost
importance
,
and
till
he
enter
the
room
,
the
misery
of
her
impatience
be
severe
.
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
have
hurry
back
in
alarm
,
supposing
,
by
the
servant
's
account
,
that
their
niece
be
take
suddenly
ill
;
 
but
satisfy
them
instantly
on
that
head
,
she
eagerly
communicate
the
cause
of
their
summon
,
read
the
two
letter
aloud
,
and
dwell
on
the
postscript
of
the
last
,
with
tremble
energy
.
 
<EOS>
Though
Lydia
have
never
be
a
favourite
with
them
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
could
not
but
be
deeply
affected
.
<EOS>
not
Lydia
only
,
but
all
be
concern
in
it
;
and
after
the
first
exclamation
of
surprise
and
horror
,
Mr.
Gardiner
readily
promise
every
assistance
in
his
power
.
 
<EOS>
Elizabeth
,
though
expect
no
less
,
thank
him
with
tear
of
gratitude
;
and
all
three
be
actuate
by
one
spirit
,
every
thing
relate
to
their
journey
be
speedily
settle
.
<EOS>
They
be
to
be
off
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
but
what
be
to
be
do
about
Pemberley
?
"
cry
Mrs.
Gardiner
.
"
<EOS>
John
tell
us
Mr.
Darcy
be
here
when
you
send
for
us
;
 
be
it
so
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
and
I
tell
him
we
should
not
be
able
to
keep
our
engagement
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
that
_
be
all
settle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
all
settle
;
"
repeat
the
other
,
as
she
run
into
her
room
to
prepare
.
"
<EOS>
and
be
they
upon
such
term
as
for
her
to
disclose
the
real
truth
!
<EOS>
oh
,
that
I
know
how
it
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
but
wish
be
vain
;
or
at
good
could
serve
only
to
amuse
her
in
the
hurry
and
confusion
of
the
following
hour
.
<EOS>
have
Elizabeth
be
at
leisure
to
be
idle
<EOS>
,
she
would
have
remain
certain
that
all
employment
be
impossible
to
one
so
wretched
as
herself
;
but
she
have
her
share
of
business
as
well
as
her
aunt
,
and
amongst
the
rest
there
be
note
to
be
write
to
all
their
friend
in
Lambton
,
with
false
excuse
for
their
sudden
departure
.
<EOS>
an
hour
,
however
,
see
the
whole
complete
;
and
Mr.
Gardiner
meanwhile
have
settle
his
account
at
the
inn
,
nothing
remain
to
be
do
but
to
go
;
and
Elizabeth
,
after
all
the
misery
of
the
morning
,
find
herself
,
in
a
short
space
of
time
than
she
could
have
suppose
,
seat
in
the
carriage
,
and
on
the
road
to
Longbourn
.
    
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
think
it
over
again
,
Elizabeth
,
"
say
her
uncle
,
as
they
drive
from
the
town
;
"
and
really
,
upon
serious
consideration
,
I
be
much
more
inclined
than
I
be
to
judge
as
your
eld
sister
do
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
It
appear
to
me
so
very
unlikely
,
that
any
young
man
should
form
such
a
design
against
a
girl
who
be
by
no
mean
unprotected
or
friendless
,
and
who
be
actually
stay
in
his
colonel
's
family
,
that
I
be
strongly
inclined
to
hope
the
good
.
<EOS>
Could
he
expect
that
her
friend
would
not
step
forward
?
<EOS>
Could
he
expect
to
be
notice
again
by
the
regiment
,
after
such
an
affront
to
Colonel
Forster
?
<EOS>
His
temptation
be
not
adequate
to
the
risk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
really
think
so
?
"
<EOS>
cry
Elizabeth
,
brighten
up
for
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
,
"
say
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
"
I
begin
to
be
of
your
uncle
's
opinion
.
<EOS>
It
be
really
too
great
a
violation
of
decency
,
honour
,
and
interest
,
for
him
to
be
guilty
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
so
very
ill
of
Wickham
.
<EOS>
Can
you
,
yourself
,
Lizzy
,
so
wholly
give
him
up
,
as
to
believe
him
capable
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
perhaps
of
neglect
his
own
interest
.
<EOS>
but
of
every
other
neglect
I
can
believe
him
capable
.
<EOS>
if
,
indeed
,
it
should
be
so
!
<EOS>
but
I
dare
not
hope
it
.
<EOS>
why
should
they
not
go
on
to
Scotland
,
if
that
have
be
the
case
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
the
first
place
,
"
reply
Mr.
Gardiner
,
"
there
be
no
absolute
proof
that
they
be
not
go
to
Scotland
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
but
their
remove
from
the
chaise
into
an
hackney
coach
be
such
a
presumption
!
<EOS>
and
,
besides
,
no
trace
of
them
be
to
be
find
on
the
Barnet
road
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
 
suppose
them
to
be
in
London
.
<EOS>
They
may
be
there
,
though
for
the
purpose
of
concealment
,
for
no
more
exceptionable
purpose
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
likely
that
money
should
be
very
abundant
on
either
side
;
and
it
may
strike
them
that
they
could
be
more
economically
,
though
less
expeditiously
,
married
in
London
,
than
in
Scotland
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
why
all
this
secrecy
?
<EOS>
why
any
fear
of
detection
?
<EOS>
why
must
their
marriage
be
private
?
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
this
be
not
likely
.
<EOS>
His
most
particular
friend
,
you
see
by
Jane
's
account
,
be
persuade
of
his
never
intend
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
Wickham
will
never
marry
a
woman
without
some
money
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
afford
it
.
<EOS>
and
what
claim
have
Lydia
<EOS>
,
what
attraction
have
she
beyond
youth
,
health
,
and
good
humour
,
that
could
make
him
for
her
sake
,
forego
every
chance
of
benefit
himself
by
marry
well
?
<EOS>
as
to
what
restraint
the
apprehension
of
disgrace
in
the
corps
may
throw
on
a
dishonourable
elopement
with
her
,
I
be
not
able
to
judge
;
for
I
know
nothing
of
the
effect
that
such
a
step
may
produce
.
<EOS>
but
as
to
your
other
objection
,
I
be
afraid
it
will
hardly
hold
good
.
<EOS>
Lydia
have
no
brother
to
step
forward
;
and
he
may
imagine
,
from
my
father
's
behaviour
,
from
his
indolence
and
the
little
attention
he
have
ever
seem
to
give
to
what
be
go
forward
in
his
family
,
that
_
he
_
would
do
as
little
,
and
think
as
little
about
it
,
as
any
father
could
do
,
in
such
a
matter
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
can
you
think
that
Lydia
be
so
lost
to
every
thing
but
love
of
him
,
as
to
consent
to
live
with
him
on
any
other
term
than
marriage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
do
seem
,
and
it
be
most
shocking
indeed
,
"
reply
Elizabeth
,
with
tear
in
her
eye
,
"
that
a
sister
's
sense
of
decency
and
virtue
in
such
a
point
should
admit
of
doubt
.
<EOS>
but
,
really
,
I
know
not
what
to
say
.
<EOS>
perhaps
I
be
not
do
her
justice
.
<EOS>
but
she
be
very
young
;
she
have
never
be
teach
to
think
on
serious
subject
;
and
for
the
last
half
year
,
nay
,
for
a
twelvemonth
,
she
have
be
give
up
to
nothing
but
amusement
and
vanity
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
allow
to
dispose
of
her
time
in
the
most
idle
and
frivolous
manner
,
and
to
adopt
any
opinion
that
come
in
her
way
.
<EOS>
since
the
shire
be
first
quarter
in
Meryton
,
nothing
but
love
,
flirtation
,
and
officer
,
have
be
in
her
head
.
<EOS>
She
have
be
do
every
thing
in
her
power
by
think
and
talk
on
the
subject
,
to
give
great
 
<EOS>
what
shall
I
call
it
?
<EOS>
susceptibility
to
her
feeling
;
which
be
naturally
lively
enough
.
<EOS>
and
we
all
know
that
Wickham
have
every
charm
of
person
and
address
that
can
captivate
a
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
see
that
Jane
,
"
say
her
aunt
,
"
do
not
think
so
ill
of
Wickham
,
as
to
believe
him
capable
of
the
attempt

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
of
whom
do
Jane
ever
think
ill
?
<EOS>
and
who
be
there

<EOS>
whatever
may
be
their
former
conduct
,
that
she
would
believe
capable
of
such
an
attempt

it
be
prove
against
them

<EOS>
but
Jane
know
,
as
well
as
I
do
,
what
Wickham
really
be
.
<EOS>
We
both
know
that
he
have
be
profligate
in
every
sense
of
the
word
.
<EOS>
that
he
have
neither
integrity
nor
honour
.
<EOS>
that
he
be
as
false
and
deceitful
,
as
he
be
insinuate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
you
really
know
all
this
?
"
cry
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
whose
curiosity
as
to
the
mode
of
her
intelligence
be
all
alive
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
indeed
,
"
reply
Elizabeth
,
colour
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
the
other
day
,
of
his
infamous
behaviour
to
Mr.
Darcy
;
and
you
,
yourself
,
when
last
at
Longbourn
,
hear
in
what
manner
he
speak
of
the
man
,
who
have
behave
with
such
forbearance
and
liberality
towards
him
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
other
circumstance
which
I
be
not
at
liberty
 
which
it
be
not
worth
while
to
relate
;
but
his
lie
about
the
whole
Pemberley
family
be
endless
.
<EOS>
from
what
he
say
of
Miss
Darcy
,
I
be
thoroughly
prepared
to
see
a
proud
,
reserved
,
disagreeable
girl
.
<EOS>
yet
he
know
to
the
contrary
himself
.
<EOS>
He
must
know
that
she
be
as
amiable
and
unpretende
as
we
have
find
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
do
Lydia
know
nothing
of
this
?
<EOS>
Can
she
be
ignorant
of
what
you
and
Jane
seem
so
well
to
understand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
!
 
<EOS>
that
,
that
be
the
bad
of
all
.
<EOS>
till
I
be
in
Kent
,
and
see
so
much
both
of
Mr.
Darcy
and
his
relation
,
Colonel
Fitzwilliam
,
I
be
ignorant
of
the
truth
myself
.
<EOS>
and
when
I
return
home
,
the
shire
be
to
leave
Meryton
in
a
week
or
fortnight
's
time
.
<EOS>
as
that
be
the
case
,
neither
Jane
,
to
whom
I
relate
the
whole
,
nor
I
,
think
it
necessary
to
make
our
knowledge
public
;
for
of
what
use
could
it
apparently
be
to
any
one
,
that
the
good
opinion
which
all
the
neighbourhood
have
of
him
,
should
then
be
overthrow
?
<EOS>

even
when
it
be
settle
that
Lydia
should
go
with
Mrs.
Forster

the
necessity
of
open
her
eye
to
his
character
never
occur
to
me

that
_
she
_
could
be
in
any
danger

the
deception
never
enter
my
head

<EOS>
that
such
a
consequence
as
_
this
_
should
ensue
,
you
may
easily
believe
be
far
enough
from
my
thought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
when
they
all
remove
to
Brighton
,
therefore
,
you
have
no
reason

I
suppose
,
to
believe
them
fond
of
each
other

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
the
slight
.
<EOS>
I
can
remember
no
symptom
of
affection
on
either
side

and
have
any
thing
of
the
kind
be
perceptible
,
you
must
be
aware
that
ours

not

it

away

him

so
we
all
be

every
girl
in
,

near
Meryton
,
be
out
of
her
sense
about
him
for
the
first
two
month
;

he
never
distinguish
_
<EOS>
her
_
<EOS>
by
any
particular
attention

,
consequently
,
after
a
moderate
period
of
extravagant
and
wild
admiration
,
her
fancy
for
him
give
way
,
and
other
of
the
regiment
,
who
treat
her
with
more
distinction
,
again
become
her
favourite
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
It
may
be
easily
believe
,
that
however
little
of
novelty
could
be
add
to
their
fear
,
hope
,
and
conjecture
,
on
this
interesting
subject
,
by
its
repeat
discussion
,
no
other
could
detain
them
from
it
long
,
during
the
whole
of
the
journey

<EOS>
from
Elizabeth

thought
it
be
never
absent

fix
there
by
the
keen
of
all
anguish

self
reproach

she
could
find
no
interval
of
ease

forgetfulness

<EOS>
They
travel
as
expeditiously
as
possible
;
and
sleep
one
night
on
the
road
,
reach
Longbourn
by
dinner
-
time
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
comfort
to
Elizabeth
to
consider
that
Jane
could
not
have
be
weary
by
long
expectation
.
  
<EOS>
the
little
Gardiners

attract
by
the
sight
of
a
chaise
,
be
stand
on
the
step
of
the
house
,
as
they
enter
the
paddock
;
and
when
the
carriage
drive
up
to
the
door
,
the
joyful
surprise
that
light
up
their
face
,
and
display
itself
over
their
whole
body

in
a
variety
of
caper

frisk

the
first
pleasing
earnest
of
their
welcome

<EOS>
Elizabeth
jump
out
;
and
,
after
give
each
of
them
an
hasty
kiss

into
the
vestibule

where
Jane

who
come
run
down
stair
from
her
mother

apartment

meet
her

Elizabeth

in
safety

<EOS>
Her
sister

however
,
assure
her

of

be
perfectly
well
;
and
their
conversation
,
which
have
be
pass
while
Mr.

Mrs.
Gardiner
be
engage
with
their
child

be
now
put
an
end

approach

run
to
her
uncle

welcome

thank
them
both

with
alternate
smile

tear

when
they
be
all
in
the
drawing

room
,
the
question
which
Elizabeth
have
already
ask
,
be
of
course
repeat
by
the
other
,

they
soon
find
that
Jane
have
no
intelligence
to
give

the
sanguine
hope
of
good
,
however
,
which
the
benevolence
of
her
heart
suggest
,
have
not
yet
desert
her
<EOS>
;
she
still
expect
that
it
would
all
end
well
,
and
that
every
morning
would
bring
some
letter
,
either
from
Lydia
or
her
father
,
to
explain
their
proceeding
,
and
perhaps
announce
the
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
,
to
whose
apartment
they
all
repair
,
after
a
few
minute
conversation
together
,
receive
them
exactly
as
may
be
expect
;
with
tear
and
lamentation
of
regret
,
invective
against
the
villanous
conduct
of
Wickham
,
and
complaint
of
her
own
suffering
and
ill
usage
;
blame
every
body
but
the
person
to
whose
ill
judging
indulgence
the
error
of
her
daughter
must
be
principally
owing
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
I
have
be
able

say
she
,
"
to
carry
my
point
of
go
to
Brighton

all
my
family

this

would
not
have
happen

poor
dear
Lydia
have
nobody
to
take
care
of
her
.
<EOS>
why
do
the
forster
ever
let
her
go
out
of
their
sight
?
<EOS>
I
be
sure
there
be
some
great
neglect
or
other
on
their
side
,
for
she
be
not
the
kind
of
girl
to
do
such
a
thing
,

she
have
be
well
look
after
.

I
always
think
they
be
very
unfit
to
have
the
charge
of
her
;

I
be
over
-
rule

as
I
always
be

poor
dear
child
!

now
here
be
Mr.
Bennet
go
away
,

know
he
will
fight
Wickham
,
wherever
he
meet
him
,

then
he
will
be
kill
,

what
be
to
become
of
us
all
?
<EOS>
the
Collinses
will
turn
us
out
,
before
he
be
cold
in
his
grave
;

if
you
be
not
kind
to
us

brother

I
do
not
know
what
we
shall
do

"
  
<EOS>
They
all
exclaim
against
such
terrific
idea
;
and
Mr.
Gardiner
,
after
general
assurance
of
his
affection
for
her
and
all
her
family
,
tell
her
that
he
mean
to
be
in
London
the
very
next
day
,
and
would
assist
Mr.
Bennet
in
every
endeavour
for
recover
Lydia
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not

way
to
useless
alarm

he

though
it
be
right
to
be
prepare
for
the
bad

there
be
no
occasion

look
on
it

certain

It
be
not
quite
a
week
since
they
leave
Brighton

<EOS>
in
a
few
day
more

may
gain
some
news

them

till
we
know
that
they
be
not
married

have
no
design

marrying

do
not

us
give
the
matter
over
as
lose

soon
as
I
get
to
town

I
shall
go
to
my
brother

make
him
come
home
with
me
to
Gracechurch
Street

may
consult
together

what
be

out

for

how
kind
you

<EOS>
but
Mr.
Gardiner
,
though
he
assure
her
again
of
his
earnest
endeavour
in
the
cause
,
could
not
avoid
recommend
moderation
to
her
,
as
well
in
her
hope
as
her
fear
;
and
,
after
talk
with
her
in
this
manner
till
dinner
be
on
table
,
they
leave
her
to
vent
all
her
feeling
on
the
housekeeper
,
who
attend
,
in
the
absence
of
her
daughter

<EOS>
though
her
brother
and
sister
be
persuade
that
there
be
no
real
occasion
for
such
a
seclusion
from
the
family
,
they
do
not
attempt
to
oppose
it
,
for
they
know
that
she
have
not
prudence
enough
to
hold
her
tongue
before
the
servant
,
while
they
wait
at
table
,
and
judge
it
better
that
_
one
<EOS>
_
only
of
the
household
,
and
the
one
whom
they
could
most
trust
,
should
comprehend
all
her
fear
and
solicitude
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
dining
-
room
they
be
soon
join
by
Mary
and
Kitty
,
who
have
be
too
busily
engage
in
their
separate
apartment
,
to
make
their
appearance
before
.
<EOS>
one
come
from
her
book
,
and
the
other
from
her
toilette
.
<EOS>
the
face
of
both
,
however
,
be
tolerably
calm
;
and
no
change
be
visible
in
either
,
except
that
the
loss
of
her
favourite
sister
,
or
the
anger
which
she
have
herself
incur
in
the
business
,
have
give
something
more
of
fretfulness
than
usual
,
to
the
accent
of
Kitty
.
<EOS>
as
for
Mary
,
she
be
mistress
enough
of
herself
to
whisper
to
Elizabeth
with
a
countenance
of
grave
reflection
,
soon
after
they
be
seat
at
table
,
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
a
most
unfortunate
affair
;
and
will
probably
be
much
talk
of
.
<EOS>
but
we
must
stem
the
tide
of
malice
,
and
pour
into
the
wounded
bosom
of
each
other
,
the
balm
of
sisterly
consolation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
,
perceive
in
Elizabeth
no
inclination
of
replying
,
she
add
,
"
unhappy
as
the
event
must
be
for
Lydia
,
we
may
draw
from
it
this
useful
lesson
;
that
loss
of
virtue
in
a
female
be
irretrievable
 
that
one
false
step
involve
her
in
endless
ruin
 
that
her
reputation
be
no
less
brittle
than
it
be
beautiful
,
 
and
that
she
can
not
be
too
much
guard
in
her
behaviour
towards
the
undeserving
of
the
other
sex
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
lift
up
her
eye
in
amazement
,
but
be
too
much
oppress
to
make
any
reply
.
<EOS>
Mary
,
however
,
continue
to
console
herself
with
such
kind
of
moral
extraction
from
the
evil
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
,
the
two
elder
Miss
Bennets
be
able
to
be
for
half
an
hour
by
themselves
;
and
Elizabeth
instantly
avail
herself
of
the
opportunity
of
make
many
enquiry
,
which
Jane
be
equally
eager
to
satisfy
.
<EOS>
after
join
in
general
lamentation
over
the
dreadful
sequel
of
this
event
,
which
Elizabeth
consider
as
all
but
certain
,
and
Miss
Bennet
could
not
assert
to
be
wholly
impossible
;
the
former
continue
the
subject
,
by
say
,
"
but
tell
me
all
and
every
thing
about
it
,
which
I
have
not
already
hear
.
<EOS>
give
me
farther
particular
.
<EOS>
what
do
Colonel
Forster
say
?
<EOS>
have
they
<EOS>
no
apprehension
of
any
thing
before
the
elopement

place

<EOS>
They
must
have
see
them
together
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Colonel
Forster
do
own
that
he
have
often
suspect
some
partiality
,
especially
on
Lydia
's
side
,
but
nothing
to
give
him
any
alarm
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
grieved
for
him
.
<EOS>
His
behaviour
be
attentive
and
kind
to
the
utmost
.
<EOS>
He
_
be
_
come
to
us
,
in
order
to
assure
us
of
his
concern
,
before
he
have
any
idea
of
their
not

go
to
Scotland
:
when
that
apprehension
first
get
abroad
,
it
hasten
his
journey
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
be
Denny
convince
that
Wickham
would
not
marry
?
<EOS>
do
he
know
of
their
intending
to
go
off
?
<EOS>
have
Colonel
Forster
see
Denny
himself
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
;
but
when
question
by
_
him
_
Denny
deny
know
any
thing
of
their
plan
,
and
would
not
give
his
real
opinion
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
repeat
his
persuasion
of
their
not
marry
 
and
from
_
<EOS>
that
_
,
I
be
incline
to
hope
,
he
may
have
be
misunderstood
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
till
Colonel
Forster
come
himself
,
not
one
of
you
entertain
a
doubt
,
I
suppose
,
of
their
be
really
married
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
it
possible
that
such
an
idea
should
enter
our
brain
!
<EOS>
I
feel
a
little
uneasy
 
a
little
fearful
of
my
sister
's
happiness
with
him
in
marriage
,
because
I
know
that
his
conduct
have
not
be
always
quite
right
.
<EOS>
My
father
and
mother
know
nothing
of
that
,
they
only
feel
how
imprudent
a
match
it
must
be
.
<EOS>
Kitty
then
own
,
with
a
very
natural
triumph
on
know
more
than
the
rest
of
us
,
that
in
Lydia
's
last
letter
,
she
have
prepare
her
for
such
a
step
.
<EOS>
She
have
know
,
it
seem
,
of
their
being
in
love
with
each
other
,
many
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
not
before
they
go
to
Brighton
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
believe
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
Colonel
Forster
appear
to
think
ill
of
Wickham
himself
?
<EOS>
do
he
know
his
real
character
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
confess
that
he
do
not
speak
so
well
of
Wickham
as
he
formerly
do
.
<EOS>
He
believe
him
to
be
imprudent
and
extravagant
.
<EOS>
and
since
this
sad
affair
have
take
place
,
it
be
say
,
that
he
leave
Meryton
greatly
in
debt
;
but
I
hope
this
may
be
false
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Jane

have
we
be
less
secret

have
we
tell
what
we

could
not
have
happen

"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
would
have
be
well
;

reply
her
sister
.
"
<EOS>
but
to
expose
the
former
fault
of
any
person
,
without
know
what
their
present
feeling
be
,
seem
unjustifiable
.
<EOS>
We
act
with
the
good
intention

"
  
"
Could
Colonel
Forster
repeat
the
particular
of
Lydia
's
note
to
his
wife
?

<EOS>
"
He
bring
it
with
him

us

Jane
then
take
it
from
her
pocket

book

give
it
to
Elizabeth

the
circumstance

may

remark

out

go

a

the

She

their
attendance

Mrs.

visit
them
frequently

with
the
design

cheering

hearten
them
up
,
though
as
she
never
come
without
report
some
fresh
instance
of
Wickham
's
extravagance
or
irregularity
,
she
seldom
go
away
without
leave
them
more
dispirited
than
she
find
them
.
  
<EOS>
all
Meryton
seem
strive
to
blacken
the
man
,
who
,
but
three
month
before
,
have
be
almost
an
angel
of
light
.
<EOS>
He
be
declare
to
be
in
debt
to
every
tradesman
in
the
place
,
and
his
intrigue
,
all
honour
with
the
title
of
seduction
,
have
be
extend
into
every
tradesman
's
family
.
<EOS>
every
body
declare
that
he
be
the
wicked
young
man
in
the
world
;
and
every
body
begin
to
find
out
,
that
they
have
always
distrust
the
appearance
of
his
goodness
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
,
though
she
do
not
credit
above
half
of
what
be
say
,
believe
enough
to
make
her
former
assurance
of
her
sister
's
ruin
still
more
certain
;
and
even
Jane
,
who
believe
still
less
of
it
,
become
almost
hopeless
,
more
especially
as
the
time
be
now
come
,
when
if
they
have
go
to
Scotland
,
which
she
have
never
before
entirely
despair
of
,
they
must
in
all
probability
have
gain
some
news
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gardiner
leave
Longbourn
on
Sunday
;
on
Tuesday
,
his
wife
receive
a
letter
from
him
;
it
tell
them
,
that
on
his
arrival
,
he
have
immediately
find
out
his
brother
,
and
persuade
him
to
come
to
Gracechurch
street
.
<EOS>
that
Mr.
Bennet
have
be
to
Epsom
and
Clapham
,
before
his
arrival
,
but
without
gain
any
satisfactory
information
;
and
that
he
be
now
determine
to
enquire
at
all
the
principal
hotel
in
town
,
as
Mr.
Bennet
think
it
possible
they
may
have
go
to
one
of
them
,
on
their
first
come
to
London
,
before
they
procure
lodging
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gardiner
himself
do
not
expect
any
success
from
this
measure
,
but
as
his
brother
be
eager
in
it
,
he
mean
to
assist
him
in
pursue
it
.
<EOS>
He
add
,
that
Mr.
Bennet
seem
wholly
disincline
at
present
,
to
leave
London
,
and
promise
to
write
again
very
soon
.
<EOS>
there
be
also
a
postscript
to
this
effect
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
write
to
Colonel
Forster
to
desire
him
to
find
out
,
if
possible
,
from
some
of
the
young
man
's
intimate
in
the
regiment
,
whether
Wickham
have
any
relation
or
connection
,
who
would
be
likely
to
know
in
what
part
of
the
town
he
have
now
conceal
himself
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
any
one
,
that
one
could
apply
to
,
with
a
probability
of
gain
such
a
clue
as
that
,
it
may
be
of
essential
consequence
.
<EOS>
at
present
we
have
nothing
to
guide
us
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Forster
will
,
I
dare
say
,
do
every
thing
in
his
power
to
satisfy
us
on
this
head
.
<EOS>
but
,
on
second
thought
,
perhaps
Lizzy
could
tell
us
,
what
relation
he
have
now
live
,
well
than
any
other
person
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
at
no
loss
to
understand
from
whence
this
deference
for
her
authority
proceed
;
but
it
be
not
in
her
power
to
give
any
information
of
so
satisfactory
a
nature
,
as
the
compliment
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
never
hear
of
his
have
have
any
relation
,
except
a
father
and
mother
,
both
of
whom
have
be
dead
many
year
.
<EOS>
It
be
possible
,
however
,
that
some
of
his
companion
in
the
shire
,
may
be
able
to
give
more
information
;
and
,
though
she
be
not
very
sanguine
in
expect
it
,
the
application
be
a
something
to
look
forward
to
.
  
<EOS>
every
day
at
Longbourn
be
now
a
day
of
anxiety
;
but
the
most
anxious
part
of
each
be
when
the
post
be
expect
.
<EOS>
the
arrival
of
letter
be
the
first
grand
object
of
every
morning
's
impatience
.
<EOS>
through
letter
,
whatever
of
good
or
bad
be
to
be
tell
,
would
be
communicate
,
and
every
succeed
day
be
expect
to
bring
some
news
of
importance
.
  
<EOS>
but
before
they
hear
again
from
Mr.
Gardiner
,
a
letter
arrive
for
their
father
,
from
a
different
quarter
,
from
Mr.
Collins
;
which
,
as
Jane
have
receive
direction
to
open
all
that
come
for
him
in
his
absence
,
she
accordingly
read
;
and
Elizabeth
,
who
know
what
curiosity
his
letter
always
be
,
look
over
her
,
and
read
it
likewise
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
follow
:
  
<EOS>
"
my
dear
SIR
,
  
"
I
feel
myself
call
upon
,
by
our
relationship
,
and
my
situation
in
life
,
to
condole
with
you
on
the
grievous
affliction
you
be
now
suffer
under
,
of
which
we
be
yesterday
inform
by
a
letter
from
Hertfordshire
.
<EOS>
be
assure
,
my
dear
Sir
,
that
Mrs.
Collins
and
myself
sincerely
sympathise
with
you
,
and
all
your
respectable
family
,
in
your
present
distress
,
which
must
be
of
the
bitter
kind
,
because
proceed
from
a
cause
which
no
time
can
remove
.
<EOS>
no
argument
shall
be
want
on
my
part
,
that
can
alleviate
so
severe
a
misfortune
;
or
that
may
comfort
you
,
under
a
circumstance
that
must
be
of
all
other
most
afflict
to
a
parent
's
mind
.
<EOS>
the
death
of
your
daughter
would
have
be
a
blessing
in
comparison
of
this
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
the
more
to
be
lament
,
because
there
be
reason
to
suppose
,
as
my
dear
Charlotte
inform
me
,
that
this
licentiousness
of
behaviour
in
your
daughter
,
have
proceed
from
a
faulty
degree
of
indulgence
,
though
,
at
the
same
time
,
for
the
consolation
of
yourself
and
Mrs.
Bennet
,
I
be
inclined
to
think
that
her
own
disposition
must
be
naturally
bad
,
or
she
could
not
be
guilty
of
such
an
enormity
,
at
so
early
an
age
.
<EOS>
howsoever
that
may
be
,
you
be
grievously
to
be
pity
,
in
which
opinion
I
be
not
only
join
by
Mrs.
Collins
,
but
likewise
by
lady
Catherine
and
her
daughter
,
to
whom
I
have
relate
the
affair
.
<EOS>
They
agree
with
me
in
apprehend
that
this
false
step
in
one
daughter
,
will
be
injurious
to
the
fortune
of
all
the
other
,
for
who
,
as
lady
Catherine
herself
condescendingly
say
,
will
connect
themselves
with
such
a
family
.
<EOS>
and
this
consideration
lead
me
moreover
to
reflect
with
augment
satisfaction
on
a
certain
event
of
last
November
,
for
have
it
be
otherwise
<EOS>
,
I
must
have
be
involve
in
all
your
sorrow
and
disgrace
.
<EOS>
let
me
advise
you
then
,
my
dear
Sir
,
to
console
yourself
as
much
as
possible
,
to
throw
off
your
unworthy
child
from
your
affection
for
ever
,
and
leave
her
to
reap
the
fruit
of
her
own
heinous
offence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
,
dear
Sir
,

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gardiner
do
not
write
again
,
till
he
have
receive
an
answer
from
Colonel
Forster
;
and
then
he
have
nothing
of
a
pleasant
nature
to
send
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
know
that
Wickham
have
a
single
relation
,
with
whom
he
keep
up
any
connection
,
and
it
be
certain
that
he
have
no
near
one
living
.
<EOS>
His
former
acquaintance
have
be
numerous
;
but
since
he
have
be
in
the
militia
,
it
do
not
appear
that
he
be
on
term
of
particular
friendship
with
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
one
therefore
who
could
be
point
out
,
as
likely
to
give
any
news
of
him
.
<EOS>
and
in
the
wretched
state
of
his
own
finance
,
there
be
a
very
powerful
motive
for
secrecy
,
in
addition
to
his
fear
of
discovery
by
Lydia
's
relation
,
for
it
have
just
transpire
that
he
have
leave
gaming
debt
behind
him
,
to
a
very
considerable
amount
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Forster
believe
that
more
than
a
thousand
pound
would
be
necessary
to
clear
his
expence
at
Brighton
.
<EOS>
He
owe
a
good
deal
in
the
town
,
but
his
debt
of
honour
be
still
more
formidable
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gardiner
do
not
attempt
to
conceal
these
particular
from
the
Longbourn
family
;
Jane
hear
them
with
horror
.
"
<EOS>
a
gamester
!
"
<EOS>
she
cry
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
wholly
unexpected
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
an
idea
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gardiner
add
in
his
letter
,
that
they
may
expect
to
see
their
father
at
home
on
the
follow
day
,
which
be
Saturday
.
<EOS>
render
spiritless
by
the
ill

success
of
all
their
endeavour
,
he
have
yield
to
his
brother
-
in

law
's
intreaty
that
he
would
return
to
his
family
,
and
leave
it
to
him
to
do
,
whatever
occasion
may
suggest
to
be
advisable
for
continue
their
pursuit
.
<EOS>
when
Mrs.
Bennet
be
tell
of
this
,
she
do
not
express
so
much
satisfaction
as
her
child
expect
,
consider
what
her
anxiety
for
his
life
have
be
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
what

home
,
and
without
poor
Lydia

"
<EOS>
she
cry

sure
he
will
not

London
before
he

be
to
fight
Wickham
,

make
him
marry

if
he
come
away

"
  
<EOS>
as
Mrs.
Gardiner
begin
to
wish
to
be
at
home
,
it
be
settle
that
she
and
her
child
should
go
to
London
,
at
the
same
time
that
Mr.
Bennet
come
from
it

<EOS>
the
coach
,
therefore
,
take
them
the
first
stage
of
their
journey
,
and
bring
its
master
back
to
Longbourn
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Gardiner
go
away
in
all
the
perplexity
about
Elizabeth
and
her
Derbyshire
friend
,
that
have
attend
her
from
that
part
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
His
name
have
never
be
voluntarily
mention
before
them
by
her
niece
;
and
the
kind
of
half
-
expectation
which
Mrs.
Gardiner
have
form
,
of
their
being
follow
by
a
letter
from
him
,
have
end
in
nothing
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
have
receive
none
since
her
return
,
that
could
come
from
Pemberley
.
  
<EOS>
the
present
unhappy
state
of
the
family
,
render
any
other
excuse
for
the
lowness
of
her
spirit
unnecessary
;
nothing
,
therefore
,
could
be
fairly
conjecture
from
_
that
_
,
though
Elizabeth
,
who
be
by
this
time
tolerably
well
acquaint
with
her
own
feeling
,
be
perfectly
aware
,
that
,
have
she
know
nothing
of
Darcy
,
she
could
have
bear
the
dread
of
Lydia
's
infamy
somewhat
better
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
spare
her
,
she
think
,
one
sleepless
night
out
of
two
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Bennet
arrive
,
he
have
all
the
appearance
of
his
usual
philosophic
composure
.
<EOS>
He
say
as
little
as
he
have
ever
be
in
the
habit
of
say
;
make
no
mention
of
the
business
that
have
take
him
away
,
and
it
be
some
time
before
his
daughter
have
courage
to
speak
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
the
afternoon
,
when
he
join
them
at
tea
,
that
Elizabeth
venture
to
introduce
the
subject
;
and
then
,
on
her
briefly
express
her
sorrow
for
what
he
must
have
endure

he

You

Elizabeth

"
You

I

slight
a

one
hundred
a

fifty

no

Wickham
be
a
fool

if
he

her
with

farthing
less

ten

I
should
be
sorry
to

so
ill

Mr.

make
no
answer

each
of
them

deep
in
thought

continue
silent
till
they
reach
the
house

<EOS>
Their
father
then
go
to
the
library
to
write
,
and
the
girl
walk
into
the
breakfast

room

"

they

really
to

Lydia

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
comfort
myself
with
thinking

reply
Jane

"
that
he
certainly
would
not
marry
Lydia

if
he
have
not
a
real
regard

our
kind
uncle
have
do
something
towards

him

I
can
not
believe
that
ten
thousand

any
thing
like
it
,
have
be
advance
.
<EOS>
He
have
child
of
his

may
have
more

<EOS>
how
could
he
spare
half
ten
thousand
pound
?

<EOS>
"
if
we
be
ever
able
to
learn
what
Wickham
's
debt
have
be
,

say
Elizabeth
,
"
and
how
much
be
settle
on
his
side
on
our
sister
<EOS>
,
we
shall
exactly
know
what
Mr.
Gardiner
have
do
for

because
Wickham
have
not
sixpence
of

the
kindness

never
be
requite

<EOS>
Their
take
her
home

afford
her
their

countenance

such
a
sacrifice

advantage

of

can
not
enough
acknowledge

by

she
be

goodness
do
not

her
miserable

she

never

a

her

my

We
must
endeavour
to
forget
all
that
have
pass
on
either
side

say
Jane
:
"
<EOS>
I
hope
and
trust
they
will
yet
be
happy

His
consenting

be
a
proof
,
I
will
believe
,
that
he
be
come
to
a
right
way
of
thinking

<EOS>
Their
mutual
affection
will
steady
them
;

I
flatter
myself
they
will
settle
so
quietly
,

live
in
so
rational
a
manner

as
may
in
time
make
their
past
imprudence

Their
conduct

be
such

as
neither
you

I

ever

It
be
useless
to
talk
of
it

<EOS>
It
now
occur
to
the
girl
that
their
mother
be
in
all
likelihood
perfectly
ignorant
of
what
have
happen

<EOS>
They
go
to
the
library
,
therefore
,

ask
their
father

whether
he
would
not
wish
them
to
make
it
known

He
be
write

without

coolly

My

I

such
a
flutter

that
I

so
I
will

and
you

for
me
.
<EOS>
We
will
settle
with
your

<EOS>
She

with
some
difficulty

persuade
her
to
wait
,
till
her
father

at
leisure
to
be
consult
.
<EOS>
one
day
's
delay
she
observe
,
would
be
of
small
importance
;
and
her
mother
be
too
happy
,
to
be
quite
so
obstinate
as
usual
.
<EOS>
other
scheme
too
come
into
her
head

<EOS>
"
I

Lady
Lucas

Mrs.
Long

<EOS>
Kitty

joy

<EOS>
Elizabeth

her
congratulation
amongst
the

and
then
,
sick
of
this
folly
,
take
refuge
in
her
own
room
,
that
she
may
think
with
freedom
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Lydia
's
situation
must
,
at
best
,
be
bad
enough
;
but
that
it
be
no
bad
,
she
have
nee
to
be
thankful
.
<EOS>
She
feel
it
so
;
and
though
,
in
look
forward
,
neither
rational
happiness
nor
worldly
prosperity
,
could
be
justly

for
her

in

what
they

only
two
hour
ago
,
she
feel
all
the
advantage
of
what
they
have
gain

<EOS>
Mr.
Bennet
have
very
often
wish
,
before
this
period
of
his
life
,
that
,
instead
of
spend
his
whole
income
,
he
have
lay
by
an
annual
sum
,
for
the
well
provision
of
his
child

and
of
his
wife

if
she
survive
him

<EOS>
He
now
wish
it
more
than
ever
.
<EOS>
have
he
do
his
duty
in
that
respect
,
Lydia
nee
not
have
be
indebte
to
her
uncle
,
for
whatever
of
honour
or
credit
could
now
be
purchase
for
her
.
<EOS>
the
satisfaction
of
prevail
on
one
of
the
most
worthless
young
man
in
Great
Britain
to
be
her
husband
,
may
then
have
rest
in
its
proper
place
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
seriously
concern
,
that
a
cause
of
so
little
advantage
to
any
one
,
should
be
forward
at
the
sole
expence
of
his
brother
-
in

law
,
and
he
be
determine
,
if
possible
,
to
find
out
the
extent
of
his
assistance
,
and
to
discharge
the
obligation
as
soon
as
he
could
.
  
<EOS>
when
first
Mr.
Bennet
have
marry
,
economy
be
hold
to
be
perfectly
useless
;
for
,
of
course
,
they
be
to
have
a
son
.
<EOS>
this
son
be
to
join
in
cut
off
the
entail
,
as
soon
as
he
should
be
of
age
,
and
the
widow
and
young
child
would
by
that
mean
be
provide
for
.
<EOS>
five
daughter
successively
enter
the
world
,
but
yet
the
son
be
to
come
;
and
Mrs.
Bennet
,
for
many
year
after
Lydia
's
birth
,
have
be
certain
that
he
would
.
<EOS>
this
event
have
at
last
be
despair
of
,
but
it
be
then
too
late
to
be
save
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
have
no
turn
for
economy
,
and
her
husband
's
love
of
independence
have
alone
prevent
their
exceed
their
income
.
  
<EOS>
five
thousand
pound
be
settle
by
marriage
article
on
Mrs.
Bennet
and
the
child
.
<EOS>
but
in
what
proportion
it
should
be
divide
amongst
the
latter
,
depend
on
the
will
of
the
parent
.
<EOS>
this
be
one
point
,
with
regard
to
Lydia
at
least
,
which
be
now
to
be
settle
,
and
Mr.
Bennet
could
have
no
hesitation
in
accede
to
the
proposal
before
him
.
<EOS>
in
term
of
grateful
acknowledgment
for
the
kindness
of
his
brother
,
though
express
most
concisely
,
he
then
deliver
on
paper
his
perfect
approbation
of
all
that
be
do
,
and
his
willingness
to
fulfil
the
engagement
that
have
be
make
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
before
suppose
that
,
could
Wickham
be
prevail
on
to
marry
his
daughter
,
it
would
be
do
with
so
little
inconvenience
to
himself
,
as
by
the
present
arrangement
.
<EOS>
He
would
scarcely
be
ten
pound
a
-
year
the
loser
,
by
the
hundred
that
be
to
be
pay
them
;
for
,
what
with
her
board
and
pocket
allowance
,
and
the
continual
present
in
money
,
which
pass
to
her
,
through
her
mother
's
hand
,
Lydia
's
expence
have
be
very
little
within
that
sum
.
  
<EOS>
that
it
would
be
do
with
such
trifling
exertion
on
his
side
,
too
,
be
another
very
welcome
surprise
;
for
his
chief
wish
at
present
,
be
to
have
as
little
trouble
in
the
business
as
possible
.
<EOS>
when
the
first
transport
of
rage
which
have
produce
his
activity
in
seek
her
be
over
,
he
naturally
return
to
all
his
former
indolence
.
<EOS>
His
letter
be
soon
dispatch
;
for
though
dilatory
in
undertaking
business
,
he
be
quick
in
its
execution
.
<EOS>
He
beg
to
know
farther
particular
of
what
he
be
indebte
to
his
brother
;
but
be
too
angry
with
Lydia
,
to
send
any
message
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
good
news
quickly
spread
through
the
house
;
and
with
proportionate
speed
through
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
It
be
bear
in
the
latter
with
decent
philosophy
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
it
would
have
be
more
for
the
advantage
of
conversation
,
have
Miss
Lydia
Bennet
come
upon
the
town
;
or
,
as
the
happy
alternative
,
be
seclude
from
the
world
,
in
some
distant
farm
house
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
much
to
be
talk
of
,
in
marry
her
;
and
the
good
-
natured
wish
for
her
well
-
doing
,
which
have
proceed
before
,
from
all
the
spiteful
old
lady
in
Meryton
,
lose
but
little
of
their
spirit
in
this
change
of
circumstance
,
because
with
such
an
husband
,
her
misery
be
consider
certain
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
fortnight
since
Mrs.
Bennet
have
be
down
stair
,
but
on
this
happy
day
,
she
again
take
her
seat
at
the
head
of
her
table
,
and
in
spirit
oppressively
high
.
<EOS>
no
sentiment
of
shame
give
a
damp
to
her
triumph
.
<EOS>
the
marriage
of
a
daughter
,
which
have
be
the
first
object
of
her
wish
,
since
Jane
be
sixteen
,
be
now
on
the
point
of
accomplishment
,
and
her
thought
and
her
word
run
wholly
on
those
attendant
of
elegant
nuptial
,
fine
muslin
,
new
carriage
,
and
servant
.
<EOS>
She
be
busily
search
through
the
neighbourhood
for
a
proper
situation
for
her
daughter
,
and
,
without
know
or
consider
what
their
income
may
be
,
reject
many
as
deficient
in
size
and
importance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Haye

Park
may
do
,
"
say
she
,
"
if
the
Gouldings
would
quit
it
,
or
the
great
house
at
Stoke
,
if
the
drawing
-
room
be
large
;
but
Ashworth
be
too
far
off
!
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
to
have
her
ten
mile
from
me
;
and
as
for
Purvis
Lodge
,
the
attic
be
dreadful
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
husband
allow
her
to
talk
on
without
interruption
,
while
the
servant
remain
.
<EOS>
but
when
they
have
withdraw
,
he
say
to
her
,
"
Mrs.
Bennet
,
before
you
take
any
,
or
all
of
these
house
,
for
your
son
and
daughter
,
let
us
come
to
a
right
understanding
.
<EOS>
into
_
one
_
house
in
this
neighbourhood
,
they
shall
never
have
admittance
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
encourage
the
impudence
of
either
,
by
receive
them
at
Longbourn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
a
long
dispute
follow
this
declaration
;
but
Mr.
Bennet
be
firm
:
it
soon
lead
to
another
;
and
Mrs.
Bennet
find
,
with
amazement
and
horror
,
that
her
husband
would
not
advance
a
guinea
to
buy
clothe
for
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
He
protest
that
she
should
receive
from
him
no
mark
of
affection
<EOS>
whatever
,
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
could
hardly
comprehend
it
.
<EOS>
that
his
anger
could
be
carry
to
such
a
point
of
inconceivable
resentment
,
as
to
refuse
his
daughter
a
privilege
,
without
which
her
marriage
would
scarcely
seem
valid
,
exceed
all
that
she
could
believe
possible
.
<EOS>
She
be
more
alive
to
the
disgrace
,
which
the
want
of
new
clothe
must
reflect
on
her
daughter
's
nuptial
,
than
to
any
sense
of
shame
at
her
elope
and
live
with
Wickham
,
a
fortnight
before
they
take
place
.
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
now
most
heartily
sorry
that
she
have
,
from
the
distress
of
the
moment
,
be
lead
to
make
Mr.
Darcy
acquaint
with
their
fear
for
her
sister
;
for
since
her
marriage
would
so
shortly
give
the
proper
termination
to
the
elopement
,
they
may
hope
to
conceal
its
unfavourable
beginning
,
from
all
those
who
be
not
immediately
on
the
spot
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
no
fear
of
its
spread
farther
,
through
his
mean
.
<EOS>
there
be
few
people
on
whose
secrecy
she
would
have
more
confidently
depend
;
but
at
the
same
time
,
there
be
no
one
,
whose
knowledge
of
a
sister
's
frailty
would
have
mortify
her
so
much
.
<EOS>
not
,
however
,
from
any
fear
of
disadvantage
from
it
,
individually
to
herself
;
for
at
any
rate
,
there
seem
a
gulf
impassable
between
them
.
<EOS>
have
Lydia
's
marriage
be
conclude
on
the
most
honourable
term
,
it
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
Mr.
Darcy
would
connect
himself
with
a
family
,
where
to
every
other
objection
would
now
be
add
,
an
alliance
and
relationship
of
the
near
kind
with
the
man
whom
he
so
justly
scorn
.
  
<EOS>
from
such
a
connection
she
could
not
wonder
that
he
should
shrink
.
<EOS>
the
wish
of
procure
her
regard
,
which
she
have
assure
herself
of
his
feeling
in
Derbyshire
,
could
not
in
rational
expectation
survive
such
a
blow
as
this
.
<EOS>
She
be
humble
<EOS>
,
she
be
grieve
;
she
repent
,
though
she
hardly
know
of
what
.
<EOS>
She
become
jealous
of
his
esteem
,
when
she
could
no
longer
hope
to
be
benefit
by
it
.
<EOS>
She
want
to
hear
of
him
,
when
there
seem
the
least
chance
of
gain
intelligence
.
<EOS>
She
be
convince
that
she
could
have
be
happy
with
him
;
when
it
be
no
longer
likely
they
should
meet
.
  
<EOS>
what
a
triumph
for
him
,
as
she
often
think
,
could
he
know
that
the
proposal
which
she
have
proudly
spurn
only
four
month
ago
,
would
now
have
be
gladly
and
gratefully
receive
!
<EOS>
He
be
as
generous
,
she
doubt
not
,
as
the
most
generous
of
his
sex
.
<EOS>
but
while
he
be
mortal
,
there
must
be
a
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
She
begin
now
to
comprehend
that
he
be
exactly
the
man
,
who
,
in
disposition
and
talent
,
would
most
suit
her
.
<EOS>
His
understanding
and
temper
,
though
unlike
her
own
,
would
have
answer
all
her
wish
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
union
that
must
have
be
to
the
advantage
of
both
;
by
her
ease
and
liveliness
,
his
mind
may
have
be
soften
,
his
manner
improve
,
and
from
his
judgment
,
information
,
and
knowledge
of
the
world
,
she
must
have
receive
benefit
of
great
importance
.
  
<EOS>
but
no
such
happy
marriage
could
now
teach
the
admire
<EOS>
multitude
what
connubial
felicity
really
be
.
<EOS>
an
union
of
a
different
tendency
,
and
preclude
the
possibility
of
the
other
,
be
soon
to
be
form
in
their
family
.
  
<EOS>
how
Wickham
and
Lydia
be
to
be
support
in
tolerable
independence
,
she
could
not
imagine
.
<EOS>
but
how
little
of
permanent
happiness
could
belong
to
a
couple
who
be
only
bring
together
because
their
passion
be
strong
than
their
virtue
,
she
could
easily
conjecture
.
     
<EOS>
Mr.
Gardiner
soon
write
again
to
his
brother
.
<EOS>
to
Mr.
Bennet
's
acknowledgment
he
briefly
reply
,
with
assurance
of
his
eagerness
to
promote
the
welfare
of
any
of
his
family
;
and
conclude
with
intreatie
that
the
subject
may
never
be
mention
to
him
again
.
<EOS>
the
principal
purport
of
his
letter
be
to
inform
them
,
that
Mr.
Wickham
have
resolve
on
quit
the
Militia
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
greatly
my
wish
that
he
should
do
so
,
"
he
add
,
"
as
soon
as
his
marriage
be
fix
on
.
<EOS>
and
I
think
you
will
agree
with
me
,
in
consider
a
removal
from
that
corps
as
highly
advisable
,
both
on
his
account
and
my
niece
's
.
<EOS>
It
be
Mr.
Wickham
's
intention
to
go
into
the
regular
;
and
,
among
his
former
friend
,
there
be
still
some
who
be
able
and
willing
to
assist
him
in
the
army
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
promise
of
an
ensigncy
in
General
"
s
regiment
,
now
quarter
in
the
North
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
advantage
to
have
it
so
far
from
this
part
of
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
He
promise
fairly
,
and
I
hope
among
different
people
,
where
they
may
each
have
a
character
to
preserve
,
they
will
both
be
more
prudent
.
<EOS>
I
have
write
to
Colonel
Forster
,
to
inform
him
of
our
present
arrangement
,
and
to
request
that
he
will
satisfy
the
various
creditor
of
Mr.
Wickham
in
and
near
Brighton
,
with
assurance
of
speedy
payment
,
for
which
I
have
pledge
myself
.
<EOS>
and
will
you
give
yourself
the
trouble
of
carry
similar
assurance
to
his
creditor
in
Meryton
,
of
whom
I
shall
subjoin
a
list
,
accord
to
his
information
.
<EOS>
He
have
give
in
all
his
debt
;
I

They

Mr.

all
the

of
Wickham
's
removal
from

clearly
as
Mr.

severe
disappointment

it

such
a

that
Lydia

but
Jane

for

sake
of
their

's
feeling
and
consequence
,
that
she
should
be
notice
on

urge
him
so
earnestly

so
rationally

so
mildly
,
to
receive
her

her
husband
at
Longbourn
,
as

have
she

Their

Jane

probably
more
than

feel

<EOS>
the
carriage
be
send

at

and
they
be
to
return

<EOS>
Their

be
dread

who

have

<EOS>
she
_
be
the
culprit

,
be
wretched
in

They
come
.
<EOS>
the
family
be
assemble
in

<EOS>
smile
deck
the
face
of

her

<EOS>
Lydia
's
voice
be
hear
in
the
vestibule
;
the
door
be
throw
open

and
she
run
into
the
room

<EOS>
Her

step
forwards
,
embrace
her

<EOS>
Their
reception
from
Mr.

,
to
whom
they
then
turn

be
not

so
cordial

<EOS>
His
countenance
rather
gain
in
austerity
;
and
he
scarcely
open
his
lip
.
<EOS>
the
easy
assurance
of
the
young
couple
,
indeed
,
be
enough
to
provoke
him
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
disgust
,
and
even
Miss
Bennet
be
shocked
.
<EOS>
Lydia
be
Lydia
still
;
untamed

unabashed
,
wild

noisy
,

fearless
.
<EOS>
She
turn
from
sister
to
sister
,
demand
their
congratulation
,
and
when
at
length
they
all
sit
down
,
look
eagerly
round
the
room
,
take
notice
of
some
little
alteration
in
it
,
and
observe
,
with
a
laugh
,
that
it
be
a
great
while
since
she
have
be
there
.
  
<EOS>
Wickham
be
not
at
all
more
distressed
than
herself
,
but
his
manner
be
always
so
pleasing
,
that
have
his
character
and
his
marriage
be
exactly
what
they
ought
,
his
smile
and
his
easy
address
,
while
he
claim
their
relationship
,
would
have
delight
them
all
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
have
not
before
believe
him
quite
equal
to
such
assurance
;
but
she
sit
down
,
resolve
within
herself
,
to
draw
no
limit
in
future
to
the
impudence
of
an
impudent
man
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
She
_
blush
,
and
Jane
blush
;
but
the
cheek
of
the
two
who
cause
their
confusion
,
suffer
no
variation
of
colour
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
want
of
discourse
.
<EOS>
the
bride
and
her
mother
could
neither
of
them
talk
fast
enough
;
and
Wickham
,
who
happen
to
sit
near
Elizabeth
,
begin
enquire
after
his
acquaintance
in
that
neighbourhood
,
with
a
good
humoured
ease
,
which
she
feel
very
unable
to
equal
in
her
reply
.
<EOS>
They
seem
each
of
them
to
have
the
happy
memory
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
nothing
of
the
past
be
recollect
with
pain
;
and
Lydia
lead
voluntarily
to
subject
,
which
her
sister
would
not
have
allude
to
for
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
"
only
think
of
its
be
three
month
,
"
she
cry
,
"
since
I
go
away
;
it
seem
but
a
fortnight
I
declare
;
and
yet
there
have
be
thing
enough
happen
in
the
time
.
<EOS>
good
gracious
!
<EOS>
when
I
go
away
,
I
be
sure
I
have
no
more
idea
of
be
married
till
I
come
back
again
!
<EOS>
though
I
think
it
would
be
very
good
fun
if
I
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
father
lift
up
his
eye
.
<EOS>
Jane
be
distressed
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
look
expressively
at
Lydia
;
but
she
,
who
never
hear
nor
see
any
thing
of
which
she
choose
to
be
insensible
<EOS>
,
gaily
continue
,
"
oh
!
mamma
,
do
<EOS>
the
people
here
about
<EOS>
know
I
be
marry
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
they
may
not
;
and
we
overtook
William
Goulding
in
his
curricle
,
so
<EOS>
I
be
determine
he
should
know
it
,
and
so
I
let
down
the
side
glass
next
to
him
,
and
take
off
my
glove
,
and
let
my
hand
just
rest
upon
the
window
frame
,
so
that
he
may
see
the
ring
,
and
then
I
bow
and
smile
like
any
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
could
bear
it
no
longer
.
<EOS>
She
get
up
,
and
run
out
of
the
room
;
and
return
no
more
,
till
she
hear
them
pass
through
the
hall
to
the
dining
-
parlour
.
<EOS>
She
then
join
them
soon
enough
to
see
Lydia
,
with
anxious
parade
,
walk
up
to
her
mother
's
right
hand
,
and
hear
her
say
to
her
eld
sister
,
"
ah
!
<EOS>
Jane
,
I
take
your
place
now
,
and
you
must
go
lower
,
because
I
be
a
married
woman
.

"
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
time
would
give
Lydia
that
embarrassment
,
from
which
she
have
be
so
wholly
free
at
first
.
<EOS>
Her
ease
and
good
spirit
increase
.
<EOS>
She
long
to
see
Mrs.
Philips
,
the
Lucases
,
and
all
their
other
neighbour
,
and
to
hear
herself
call
"
Mrs.
Wickham

"
by
each
of
them
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
she
go
after
dinner
to
shew
her
ring
and
boast
of
be
marry
,
to
Mrs.
Hill
and
the
two
housemaid

"
well

say
she
,
when
they

all

what
do
you
think
of
my
husband

be
not
he
a
charming
man

I
be
sure

must
all
envy
me

<EOS>
I
only
hope
they
may
have
half
my
good
luck

<EOS>
They
must
all
go
to
Brighton

<EOS>
that
be
the
place
to
get
husband

what
a
pity
it
be
,
mamma

we
do
not
all
go

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
true
;
and
if
I
have
my
will
,
we
should
.
<EOS>
but
my
dear
Lydia
,
I
do
not
at
all
like
your
go
such
a
way
off

<EOS>
Must
it
be
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
lord
!
<EOS>
yes
;
 
there
be
nothing
in
that

<EOS>
I
shall
like
it
of
all
thing

You
and
papa

and
my
sister

must
come
down
and
see
us
.
<EOS>
We
shall
be
at
Newcastle
all
the
winter
,
and
I
dare
say
there
will
be
some
ball
,
and
I
will
take
care
to
get
good
partner
for
them
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
it
beyond
any
thing

say
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
then
when
you
go
away
,
you
may
leave
one
or
two
of
my
sister
behind
you
;
and
I
dare
say
I
shall
get
husband
for
them
before
the
winter
be
over

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
for
my
share
of
the
favour

"
say
Elizabeth
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
particularly
like
your
way
of
get
husband

<EOS>
Their
visitor
be
not
to
remain
above
ten
day
with
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wickham
have
receive
his
commission
before
he
leave
London
,
and
he
be
to
join
his
regiment
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
.
  
<EOS>
no
one
but
Mrs.
Bennet
,
regret
that
their
stay
would
be
so
short
;
and
she
make
the
most
of
the
time
,
by
visit
about
with
her
daughter
,
and
have
very
frequent
party
at
home
.
<EOS>
these
party
be
acceptable
to
all
;
to
avoid
a
family
circle
be
even
more
desirable
to
such
as
do
think
,
than
such
as
do
not
.
  
<EOS>
Wickham
's
affection
for
Lydia
,
be
just
what
Elizabeth
have
expect
to
find
it
;
not
equal
to
Lydia
's
for
him
.
<EOS>
She
have
scarcely
need
her
present
observation
to
be
satisfied
,
from
the
reason
of
thing
,
that
their
elopement
have
be
bring
on
by
the
strength
of
her
love
,
rather
than
by
his
;
and
she
would
have
wonder
why
,
without
violently
care
for
her
,
he
choose
to
elope
with
her
at
all
,
have
she
not
feel
certain
that
his
flight
be
render
necessary
by
distress
of
circumstance
;
and
if
that
be
the
case
,
he
be
not
the
young
man
to
resist
an
opportunity
of
have
a
companion
.
  
<EOS>
Lydia
be
exceedingly
fond
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
her
dear
Wickham
on
every
occasion
;
no
one
be
to
be
put
in
competition
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
do
every
thing
best
in
the
world
;
and
she
be
sure
he
would
kill
more
bird
on
the
first
of
September
,
than
any
body
else
in
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
one
morning
,
soon
after
their
arrival
,
as
she
be
sit
with
her
two
elder
sister
,
she
say
to
Elizabeth
,
  
"
<EOS>
Lizzy
,
I
never
give
_
you
_
an
account
of
my
wedding
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
You
be
not
by
,
when
I
tell
mamma
,
and
the
other
,
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
be
not
you
curious
to
hear
how
it
be
manage
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
really
,
"
reply
Elizabeth
;
"
I
think
there
can
not
be
too
little
say
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
La
!
<EOS>
You
be
so
strange
!
<EOS>
but
I
must
tell
you
how
it
go
off
.
<EOS>
We
be
married
,
you
know
,
at
St.
Clement
's
,
because
Wickham
's
lodging
be
in
that
parish
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
settle
that
we
should
all
be
there
by
eleven
o'clock
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
and
aunt
<EOS>
and
I
be
to
go
together
;
and
the
other
be
to
meet
us
at
the
church
.
<EOS>
well
,
Monday
morning
come
,
and
I
be
in
such
a
fuss
!
<EOS>
I
be
so
afraid
you
know
that
something
would
happen
to
put
it
off
,
and
then
I
should
have
go
quite
distract
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
my
aunt
,
all
the
time
I
be
dress
,
preach
and
talk
away
just
as
if
she
be
read
a
sermon
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
do
not
hear
above
one
word
in
ten
,
for
I
be
think
,
you
may
suppose
,
of
my
dear
Wickham
.
<EOS>
I
long
to
know
whether
he
would
be
marry
in
his
blue
coat
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
and
so
we
breakfast
at
ten
as
usual
;
I
think
it
would
never
be
over
;
for
,
by
the
bye
,
you
be
to
understand
,
that
my
uncle
and
aunt
be
horrid
unpleasant
all
the
time
I
be
with
them
.
<EOS>
if
you
will
believe
me
,
I
do
not
once
put
my
foot
out
of
door
,
though
I
be
there
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
not
one
party
,
or
scheme
,
or
any
thing
.
<EOS>
to
be
sure
London
be
rather
thin
,
but
however
the
little
Theatre
be
open
.
<EOS>
well
,
and
so
just
as
the
carriage
come
to
the
door
,
my
uncle
be
call
away
upon
business
to
that
horrid
man
Mr.
Stone
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
you
know
,
when
once
they
get
together
,
there
be
no
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
well
,
I
be
so
frightened
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
to
do
,
for
my
uncle
be
to
give
me
away
;
and
if
we
be
beyond
the
hour
,
we
could
not
be
marry
all
day
.
<EOS>
but
,
luckily
,
he
come
back
again
in
ten
minute
time
,
and
then
we
all
set
out
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
recollect
afterwards
,
that
if
he
_
have
_
be
prevent
go
,
the
wedding
nee
not
be
put
off
,
for
Mr.
Darcy
may

Mr.
Darcy
!

repeat
Elizabeth
,
in
utter
amazement
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
!
 
<EOS>
he
be
to
come
there
with
Wickham
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
but
gracious
me
!
<EOS>
I
quite
forget
!
<EOS>
I
ought
not
to
have
say
a
word
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
promise
them
so
faithfully
!
<EOS>
what
will
Wickham
say
?
<EOS>
It
be
to
be
such
a
secret
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
to
be
secret
,
"
say
Jane
,
"
say
not
another
word
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
You
may
depend
upon
my
seek
no
further
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
certainly
,
"
say
Elizabeth
,
though
burn
with
curiosity
;
"
we
will
ask
you
no
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
"
say
Lydia
,
"
<EOS>
for
if
you
do
,
I
should
certainly
tell
you
all
,
and
then
Wickham
would
be
angry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
on
such
encouragement
to
ask
,
Elizabeth
be
force
to
put
it
out
of
her
power
,
by
run
away
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
live
in
ignorance
on
such
a
point
be
impossible
;
or
at
least
it
be
impossible
not
to
try
for
information
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
have
be
at
her
sister
's
wedding
.
<EOS>
It
be
exactly
a
scene
,
and
exactly
among
people
,
where
he
have
apparently
least
to
do
,
and
least
temptation
to
go
.
<EOS>
conjecture
as
to
the
meaning
of
it
,
rapid
and
wild
,
hurry
into
her
brain
;
but
she
be
satisfied
with
none
.
<EOS>
those
that
best
please
her
,
as
place
his
conduct
in
the
noble
light
,
seem
most
improbable
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bear
such
suspense
;
and
hastily
seize
a
sheet
of
paper
,
write
a
short
letter
to
her
aunt
,
to
request
an
explanation
of
what
Lydia
have
dropt
,
if
it
be
compatible
with
the
secrecy
which
have
be
intend
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
readily
comprehend
,
"
she
add
,
"
what
my
curiosity
must
be
to
know
how
a
person
unconnected
with
any
of
us
,
and
(
comparatively
speak
)
a
stranger
to
our
family
,
should
have
be
amongst
you
at
such
a
time
.
<EOS>
pray
write
instantly
,
and
let
me
understand
it
 
unless
it
be
,
for
very
cogent
reason
,
to
remain
in
the
secrecy
which
Lydia
seem
to
think
necessary
;
and
then
I
must
endeavour
to
be
satisfied
with
ignorance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
that
I
_
shall
_
though
,
"
she
add
to
herself
,
as
she
finish
the
letter
;
"
and
my
dear
aunt
,
if
you
do
not
tell
me
in
an
honourable
manner
,
I
shall
certainly
be
reduce
to
trick
and
stratagem
to
find
it
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jane
's
delicate
sense
of
honour
would
not
allow
her
to
speak
to
Elizabeth
privately
of
what
Lydia
have
let
fall
;
Elizabeth
be
glad
of
it
;
 
till
it
appear
whether
her
inquiry
would
receive
any
satisfaction
,
she
have
rather
be
without
a
confidante
.
    
<EOS>
Elizabeth
have
the
satisfaction
of
receive
an
answer
to
her
letter
,
as
soon
as
she
possibly
could
.
<EOS>
She
be
no
sooner
in
possession
of
it
,
than
hurry
into
the
little
copse
,
where
she
be
least
likely
to
be
interrupt
,
she
sit
down
on
one
of
the
bench
,
and
prepare
to
be
happy
;
for
the
length
of
the
letter
convince
her
that
it
do
not
contain
a
denial
.

"
Gracechurch
-
street
,
September
6
.
  
<EOS>
"
my
dear
niece
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
receive
your
letter
,
and
shall
devote
this
whole
morning
to
answer
it
,
as
I
foresee
that
a
_
little
_
writing
will
not
comprise
what
I
have
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
must
confess
myself
surprised
by
your
application
;
I
do
not
expect
it
from
_
you
_
.
<EOS>
do
not
think
me
angry
,
however
,
for
I
only
mean
to
let
you
know
,
that
I
have
not
imagine
such
enquiry
to
be
necessary
on
_
your
_
side
.
<EOS>
if
you
do
not
choose
to
understand
me
,
forgive
my
impertinence
.
<EOS>
Your
uncle
be
as
much
surprised
as
I
be
 
and
nothing
but
the
belief
of
your
be
a
party
concern
,
would
have
allow
him
to
act
as
he
have
do
.
<EOS>
but
if
you
be
really
innocent
and
ignorant
,
I
must
be
more
explicit
.
<EOS>
on
the
very
day
of
my
come
home
from
Longbourn
,
your
uncle
have
a
most
unexpected
visitor
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
call
,
and
be
shut
up
with
him
several
hour
.
<EOS>
It
be
all
over
before
I
arrive
;
so
my
curiosity
be
not
so
dreadfully
rack
as
_
<EOS>
your
be
_
seem
to
have
be
.
<EOS>
He
come
to
tell
Mr.
Gardiner
that
he
have
find
out
where
your
sister
and
Mr.
Wickham
be
,
and
that
he
have
see
and
talk
with
them
both
,
Wickham
repeatedly
,
Lydia
once
.
<EOS>
from
what
I
can
collect
,
he
leave
Derbyshire
only
one
day
after
ourselves
,
and
come
to
town
with
the
resolution
of
hunt
for
them
.
<EOS>
the
motive
profess
,
be
his
conviction
of
its
be
owe
to
himself
that
Wickham
's
worthlessness
have
not
be
so
well
known
,
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
any
young
woman
of
character
,
to
love
or
confide
in
him
.
<EOS>
He
generously
impute
the
whole
to
his
mistaken
pride
,
and
confess
that
he
have
before
think
it
beneath
him
,
to
lay
his
private
action
open
to
the
world
.
<EOS>
His
character
be
to
speak
for
itself
.
<EOS>
He
call
it
,
therefore
,
his
duty
to
step
forward
,
and
endeavour
to
remedy
an
evil
,
which
have
be
bring
on
by
himself
.
<EOS>
if
he
_
have
another
_
motive
,
I
be
sure
it
would
never
disgrace
him
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
some
day
in
town
,
before
he
be
able
to
discover
them
;
but
he
have
something
to
direct
his
search
,
which
be
more
than
<EOS>
_
we
_
have
;
and
the
consciousness
of
this
,
be
another
reason
for
his
resolving
to
follow
us
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
lady
,
it
seem
,
a
Mrs.
Younge
,
who
be
some
time
ago
governess
to
Miss
Darcy
,
and
be
dismiss
from
her
charge
on
some
cause
of
disapprobation
,
though
he
do
not
say
what
.
<EOS>
She
then
take
a
large
house
in
Edward
-
street
,
and
have
since
maintain
herself
by
let
lodging
.
<EOS>
this
Mrs.
Younge
be
,
he
know
,
intimately
acquaint
with
Wickham
;
and
he
go
to
her
for
intelligence
of
him
,
as
soon
as
he
get
to
town
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
two
or
three
day
before
he
could
get
from
her
what
he
want
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
betray
her
trust
,
I
suppose
,
without
bribery
and
corruption
,
for
she
really
do
know
where
her
friend
be
to
be
find
.
<EOS>
Wickham
indeed
have
go
to
her
,
on
their
first
arrival
in
London
,
and
have
she
be
able
to
receive
them
into
her
house
,
they
would
have
take
up
their
abode
with
her
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
our
kind
friend
procure
the
wish
-
for
direction
.
<EOS>
They
be
in
 
street
.
<EOS>
He
see
Wickham
,
and
afterwards
insist
on
see
Lydia
.
<EOS>
His
first
object
with
her
,
he
acknowledge
,
have
be
to
persuade
her
to
quit
her
present
disgraceful
situation
,
and
return
to
her
friend
as
soon
as
they
could
be
prevail
on
to
receive
her
,
offer
his
assistance
,
as
far
as
it
would
go
.
<EOS>
but
he
find
Lydia
absolutely
resolve
on
remain
where
she
be
.
<EOS>
She
care
for
none
of
her
friend
,
she
want
no
help
of
his
,
she
would
not
hear
of
leave
Wickham
.
<EOS>
She
be
sure
they
should
be
marry
some
time
or
other
,
and
it
do
not
much
signify
when
.
<EOS>
since
such
be
her
feeling
,
it
only
remain
,
he
think
,
to
secure
and
expedite
a
marriage
,
which
,
in
his
very
first
conversation
with
Wickham
,
he
easily
learn
,
have
never
be
_
his
_
design
.
<EOS>
He
confess
himself
oblige
to
leave
the
regiment
,
on
account
of
some
debt
of
honour
,
which
be
very
pressing
;
and
scruple
not
to
lay
all
the
ill
-
consequence
of
Lydia
's
flight
,
on
her
own
folly
alone
.
<EOS>
He
mean
to
resign
his
commission
immediately
;
and
as
to
his
future
situation
,
he
could
conjecture
very
little
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
must
go
somewhere
,
but
he
do
not
know
where
,
and
he
know
he
should
have
nothing
to
live
on
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
ask
him
why
he
have
not
marry
your
sister
at
once
.
<EOS>
though
Mr.
Bennet
be
not
imagine
to
be
very
rich
,
he
would
have
be
able
to
do
something
for
him
,
and
his
situation
must
have
be
benefit
by
marriage
.
<EOS>
but
he
find
,
in
reply
to
this
question
,
that
Wickham
still
cherish
the
hope
of
more
effectually
make
his
fortune
by
marriage
,
in
some
other
country
.
<EOS>
under
such
circumstance
,
however
,
he
be
not
likely
to
be
proof
against
the
temptation
of
immediate
relief
.
<EOS>
They
meet
several
time
,
for
there
be
much
to
be
discuss
.
<EOS>
Wickham
of
course
want
more
than
he
could
get
;
but
at
length
be
reduce
to
be
reasonable
.
<EOS>
every
thing
be
settle
between
_
them
_
,
Mr.
Darcy
's
next
step
be
to
make
your
uncle
acquaint
with
it
,
and
he
first
call
in
Gracechurch
-
street
the
evening
before
I
come
home
.
<EOS>
but
Mr.
Gardiner
could
not
be
see
,
and
Mr.
Darcy
find
,
on
further
enquiry
,
that
your
father
be
still
with
him
,
but
would
quit
town
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
judge
your
father
to
be
a
person
whom
he
could
so
properly
consult
as
your
uncle
,
and
therefore
readily
postpone
see
him
,
till
after
the
departure
of
the
former
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
leave
his
name
,
and
till
the
next
day
,
it
be
only
know
that
a
gentleman
have
call
on
business
.
<EOS>
on
Saturday
he
come
again
.
<EOS>
Your
father
be
go
,
your
uncle
at
home
,
and
,
as
I
say
before
,
they
have
a
great
deal
of
talk
together
.
<EOS>
They
meet
again
on
Sunday
,
and
then
_
I
_
see
him
too
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
all
settle
before
Monday
:
as
soon
as
it
be
,
the
express
be
send
off
to
Longbourn
.
<EOS>
but
our
visitor
be
very
obstinate
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
,
Lizzy
,
that
obstinacy
be
the
real
defect
of
his
character
after
all
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
accuse
of
many
fault
at
different
time
;
but
_
<EOS>
this
_
be
the
true
one
.
<EOS>
nothing
be
to
be
do
that
he
do
not
do
himself
;
though
I
be
sure
(
and
I
do
not
speak
it
to
be
thank
,
therefore
say
nothing
about
it
,
)
<EOS>
your
uncle
would
most
readily
have
settle
the
whole
.
<EOS>
They
battle
it
together
for
a
long
time
,
which
be
more
than
either
the
gentleman
or
lady
concern
in
it
deserve
.
<EOS>
but
at
last
your
uncle
be
force
to
yield
,
and
instead
of
be
allow
to
be
of
use
to
his
niece
,
be
force
to
put
up
with
only
have
the
probable
credit
of
it
,
which
go
sorely
against
the
grain
;
and
I
really
believe
your
letter
this
morning
give
him
great
pleasure
,
because
it
require
an
explanation
that
would
rob
him
of
his
borrow
feather
,
and
give
the
praise
where
it
be
due
.
<EOS>
but
,
Lizzy
,
this
must
go
no
farther
than
yourself
,
or
Jane
at
most
.
<EOS>
You
know
pretty
well
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
what
have
be
do
for
the
young
people
.
<EOS>
His
debt
be
to
be
pay
,
amount
,
I
believe
,
to
considerably
more
than
a
thousand
pound
,
another
thousand
in
addition
to
her
own
settle
upon
_
her
_
,
and
his
commission
purchase
.
<EOS>
the
reason
why
all
this
be
to
be
do
by
him
alone
,
be
such
as
I
have
give
above
.
<EOS>
It
be
owe
to
him
,
to
his
reserve
,
and
want
of
proper
consideration
,
that
Wickham
's
character
have
be
so
misunderstood
,
and
consequently
that
he
have
be
receive
and
notice
as
he
be
.
<EOS>
perhaps
there
be
some
truth
in
_
this
_
;
though
I
doubt
whether
_
his
_
reserve
,
or
_
anybody
's
_
reserve
,
can
be
answerable
for
the
event
.
<EOS>
but
in
spite
of
all
this
fine
talking
,
my
dear
Lizzy
,
you
may
rest
perfectly
assure
,
that
your
uncle
would
never
have
yield
,
if
we
have
not
give
him
credit
for
_
<EOS>
another
interest
_
in
the
affair
.
<EOS>
when
all
this
be
resolve
on
,
he
return
again
to
his
friend
,
who
be
still
stay
at
Pemberley
;
but
it
be
agree
that
he
should
be
in
London
once
more
when
the
wedding
take
place
,
and
all
money
matter
be
then
to
receive
the
last
finish
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
have
now
tell
you
every
thing
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
relation
which
you
tell
me
be
to
give
you
great
surprise
;
I
hope
at
least
it
will
not
afford
you
any
displeasure
.
<EOS>
Lydia
come
to
us
;
and
Wickham
have
constant
admission
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
He
_
be
exactly
what
he
have
be
,
when
I
know
him
in
Hertfordshire
;
but
I
would
not
tell
you
how
little
I
be
satisfied
with
_
her
_
behaviour
while
she
staid
with
us
,
if
I
have
not
perceive
,
by
Jane
's
letter
last
Wednesday
,
that
her
conduct
on
come
home
be
exactly
of
a
piece
with
it
,
and
therefore
what
I
now
tell
you
,
can
give
you
no
fresh
pain
.
<EOS>
I
talk
to
her
repeatedly
in
the
most
serious
manner
,
represent
to
her
all
the
wickedness
of
what
she
have
do
,
and
all
the
unhappiness
she
have
bring
on
her
family
.
<EOS>
if
she
hear
me
,
it
be
by
good
luck
,
for
I
be
sure
she
do
not
listen
.
<EOS>
I
be
sometimes
quite
provoke
,
but
then
I
recollect
my
dear
Elizabeth
and
Jane
,
and
for
their
sake
have
patience
with
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
be
punctual
in
his
return
,
and
as
Lydia
inform
you
,
attend
the
wedding
.
<EOS>
He
dine
with
us
the
next
day
,
and
be
to
leave
town
again

Wednesday
or
Thursday

<EOS>
Will
you
be
very
angry
with
me
,
my
dear
Lizzy
,
if
I
take
this
opportunity
of
say
(
what
I
be
never
bold
enough
to
say
before
)
how
much
I
like
him
.
<EOS>
His
behaviour
to
us
have
,
in
every
respect
,
be
as
pleasing
as
when
we
be
in
Derbyshire
.
<EOS>
His
understanding
and
opinion
all
please
me
;
he
want
nothing
but
a
little
more
liveliness
,
and
_
<EOS>
that
_
,
if
he
marry
_
<EOS>
prudently
_
,
his
wife
may
teach
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
him
very
sly
;
 
he
hardly
ever
mention
your
name
.
<EOS>
but
slyness
seem
the
fashion
.
<EOS>
pray
forgive
me
,
if
I
have
be
very
presuming
,
or
at
least
do
not
punish
me
so
far
,
as
to
exclude
me
from
P.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
be
quite
happy
till
I
have
be
all
round
the
park
.
<EOS>
a
low
phaeton
,
with
a
nice
little
pair
of
pony
,
would
be
the
very
thing
.
<EOS>
but
I
must
write
no
more
.
<EOS>
the
child
have
be
want
me
this
half
hour
.
<EOS>
Your
be
,
very
sincerely

GARDINER

"
  
<EOS>
the
content
of
this
letter
throw
Elizabeth
into
a
flutter
of
spirit
,
in
which
it
be
difficult
to
determine
whether
pleasure
or
pain
bore
the
great
share
.
<EOS>
the
vague
and
unsettled
suspicion
which
uncertainty
have
produce
of
what
Mr.
Darcy
may
have
be
do
to
forward
her
sister
's
match
,
which
she
have
fear
to
encourage
,
as
an
exertion
of
goodness
too
great
to
be
probable
,
and
at
the
same
time
dread
to
be
just
,
from
the
pain
of
obligation
,
be
prove
beyond
their
great
extent
to
be
true
!
<EOS>
He
have
follow
them
purposely
to
town
,
he
have
take
on
himself
all
the
trouble
and
mortification
attendant
on
such
a
research
;
in
which
supplication
have
be
necessary
to
a
woman
whom
he
must
abominate
and
despise
,
and
where
he
be
reduce
to
meet
,
frequently
meet
,
reason
with
,
persuade
,
and
finally
bribe
,
the
man
whom
he
always
most
wish
to
avoid
,
and
whose
very
name
it
be
punishment
to
him
to
pronounce
.
<EOS>
He
have
do
all
this
for
a
girl
whom
he
could
neither
regard
nor
esteem
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
do
whisper
,
that
he
have
do
it
for
her
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
hope
shortly
check
by
other
consideration
,
and
she
soon
feel
that
even
her
vanity
be
insufficient
,
when
require
to
depend
on
his
affection
for
her
,
for
a
woman
who
have
already
refuse
him
,
as
able
to
overcome
a
sentiment
so
natural
as
abhorrence
against
relationship
with
Wickham
.
<EOS>
brother
-
in
-
law
of
Wickham
!
<EOS>
every
kind
of
pride
must
revolt
from
the
connection
.
<EOS>
He
have
to
be
sure
do
much
.
<EOS>
She
be
ashamed
to
think
how
much
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
give
a
reason
for
his
interference
,
which
ask
no
extraordinary
stretch
of
belief
.
<EOS>
It
be
reasonable
that
he
should
feel
he
have
be
wrong
;
he
have
liberality
,
and
he
have
the
mean
of
exercise
it
;
and
though
she
would
not
place
herself
as
his
principal
inducement
,
she
could
,
perhaps
,
believe
,
that
remain
partiality
for
her
,
may
assist
his
endeavour
in
a
cause
where
her
peace
of
mind
must
be
materially
concerned
.
<EOS>
It
be
painful
,
exceedingly
painful
,
to
know
that
they
be
under
obligation
to
a
person
who
could
never
receive
a
return
.
<EOS>
They
owe
the
restoration
of
Lydia
,
her
character
,
every
thing
to
him
.
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
heartily
do
she
grieve
over
every
ungracious
sensation
she
have
ever
encourage
,
every
saucy
speech
she
have
ever
direct
towards
him
.
<EOS>
for
herself
she
be
humble
;
but
she
be
proud
of
him
.
<EOS>
proud
that
in
a
cause
of
compassion
and
honour
,
he
have
be
able
to
get
the
well
of
himself
.
<EOS>
She
read
over
her
aunt
's
commendation
of
him
again
and
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
enough
;
but
it
please
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
even
sensible
of
some
pleasure
,
though
mix
with
regret
,
on
find
how
steadfastly
both
she
and
her
uncle
have
be
persuade
that
affection
and
confidence
subsist
between
Mr.
Darcy
and
herself
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
rouse
from
her
seat
,
and
her
reflection
,
by
some
one
's
approach
;
and
before
she
could
strike
into
another
path
,
she
be
overtake
by
Wickham
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
I
interrupt
your
solitary
ramble
,
my
dear
sister
?
"
say
he
,
as
he
join
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
certainly
do
,
"
she
reply
with
a
smile
;
"
but
it
do
not
follow
that
the
interruption
must
be
unwelcome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
sorry
indeed
,
if
it
be
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
We
_
be
always
good
friend
;
and
now
we
be
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
true
.
<EOS>
be
the
other
come
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
and
Lydia
be
go
in
the
carriage
to
Meryton
.
<EOS>
and
so
,
my
dear
sister
,
I
find
from
our
uncle
and
aunt
,
that
you
have
actually
see
Pemberley
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
reply
in
the
affirmative
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
almost
envy
you
the
pleasure
,
and
<EOS>
yet
I
believe
it
would
be
too
much
for
me
,
or
else
I
could
take
it
in
my
way
to
Newcastle
.
<EOS>
and
you
see
the
old
housekeeper
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
Poor
Reynolds
,
she
be
always
very
fond
of
me
.
<EOS>
but
of
course
she
do
not
mention
my
name
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
she
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
do
she
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
that
you
be
go
into
the
army
,
and
she
be
afraid
have
 
not
turn
out
well
.
<EOS>
at
such
a
distance
as
_
that
_
,
you
know
,
thing
be
strangely
misrepresented
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
"
he
reply
,
bite
his
lip
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
hope
she
have
silence
him
;
but
he
soon
afterwards
say
,
  
"
I
be
surprised
to
see
Darcy
in
town
last
month
.
<EOS>
We
pass
each
other
several
time
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
he
can
be
do
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
perhaps
prepare
for
his
marriage
with
Miss
de
Bourgh
,
"
say
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
something
particular
,
to
take
him
there
at
this
time
of
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
undoubtedly
.
<EOS>
do
you
see
him
while
you
be
at
Lambton
?
<EOS>
I
think
I
understand
from
the
Gardiners
that
you
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
;
he
introduce
us
to
his
sister
.
"
  
"
and
do
you
like
her
?
"
  
"
very
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
,
indeed
,
that
she
be
uncommonly
improve
within
this
year
or
two
.
<EOS>
when
I
last
see
her
,
she
be
not
very
promising
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
glad
you
like
her
.
<EOS>
I
hope
she
will
turn
out
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
she
will
;
she
have
get
over
the
most
trying
age
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
go
by
the
village
of
Kympton
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
recollect
that
we
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mention
it
,
because
it
be
the
living
which
I
ought
to
have
have
.
<EOS>
a
most
delightful
place
!
 
<EOS>
Excellent
Parsonage
House
!
<EOS>
It
would
have
suit
me
in
every
respect
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
how
should
you
have
like
make
sermon
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
exceedingly
well
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
consider
it
as
part
of
my
duty
,
and
the
exertion
would
soon
have
be
nothing
.
<EOS>
one
ought
not
to
repine
;
 
but
,
to
be
sure
,
it
would
have
be
such
a
thing
for
me
!
<EOS>
the
quiet
,
the
retirement
of
such
a
life
,
would
have
answer
all
my
idea
of
happiness
!
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
to
be
.
<EOS>
do
you
ever
hear
Darcy
mention
the
circumstance
,
when
you
be
in
Kent
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I

have

hear
from
authority

I
think

as
good

that
it

leave
you
conditionally
only

at
the
will
of
the
present
patron

<EOS>
"
You
have

yes

there
be
something
in

that

I
tell
you
so
from
the
first

you
may
remember

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
_
do
_
hear
,
too
,
that
there
be
a
time
,
when
sermon
-
making
be
not
so
palatable
to
you
as
it
seem
to
be
at
present
;
that
you
actually
declare
your
resolution
of
never
take
order
,

that
the
business
have
be
compromise
accordingly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
!
<EOS>
and
it
be
not
wholly
without
foundation

<EOS>
You
may
remember
what
I
tell
you
on
that
point
,
when
first
we
talk
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
be
now
almost
at
the
door
of
the
house
,
for
she
have
walk
fast
to
get
rid
of
him
;
and
unwilling
for
her
sister
's
sake
,
to
provoke
him
,
she
only
say
in
reply
,
with
a
good
-
humoured
smile
,
  
"
<EOS>
come
,
Mr.
Wickham

She
hold
out
her
hand
;
he
kiss
it
with
affectionate
gallantry
,
though
he
hardly
know
how
to
look
,
and
they
enter
the
house
.
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Wickham
be
so
perfectly
satisfied
with
this
conversation
,
that
he
never
again
distress
himself
,
or
provoke
his
dear
sister
Elizabeth

by
introduce
the
subject
of
it
;
and
she
be
pleased
to
find
that
she
have
say
enough
to
keep
him
quiet

<EOS>
the
day
of
his

departure

as

twelvemonth

Mr.

adieu

much
more
affectionate

look
handsome

many
pretty

He

make
love
to

I
be
prodigiously
proud
of

defy
even
Sir
William
Lucas

valuable

"
  
<EOS>
the
loss
of
her
daughter
make
Mrs.
Bennet
very
dull
for
several
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
often
think
,

say
she
,
"
that
there
be
nothing
so
bad
as
part
with
one
's
friend

so
forlorn

this
be
the
consequence

no
such
thing

far
off

if
that

be
near

she
would
not

<EOS>
but
the
spiritless
condition
which
this
event
throw
her
into
,
be
shortly
relieve
,
and
her
mind
open
again
to
the
agitation
of
hope
,
by
an
article
of
news
,
which
then
begin
to
be
in
circulation

It
be
many
month
since
she
have
mention
his
name
to
Elizabeth
;
but
now
,
as
soon
as
they
be
alone
together
,
she
say
,
  
"
I
see
you
look
at
me
to
-
day
,
Lizzy
,
when
my
aunt
tell
us
of
the
present
report
;
and
I
know
I
appear
distressed
.
<EOS>
but
do
not
imagine
it
be
from
any
silly
cause
.
<EOS>
I
be
only
confused
for
the
moment
,
because
I
feel
that
I
_
should
_
be
look
at
.
<EOS>
I
do
assure
you
,
that
the
news
do
not
affect
me
either
with
pleasure
or
pain
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
of
one
thing
,
that
he
come
alone
;
because
we
shall
see
the
less
of
him
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
be
afraid
of
_
myself
_
,
but
I
dread
other
people
's
remark
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
do
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
.
<EOS>
have
she
not
see
him
in
Derbyshire
,
she
may
have
suppose
him
capable
of
come
there
,
with
no
other
view
than
what
be
acknowledge
;
but
she
still
think
him
partial
to
Jane
,
and
she
waver
as
to
the
great
probability
of
his
come
there
_
with
_
his
friend
's
permission
,
or
be
bold
enough
to
come
without
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
yet
it
be
hard
,
"
she
sometimes
think
,
"
that
this
poor
man
can
not
come
to
a
house
,
which
he
have
legally
hire
,
without
raise
all
this
speculation
!
<EOS>
I
_
will
_
leave
him
to
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
spite
of
what
her
sister
declare
,
and
really
believe
to
be
her
feeling
,
in
the
expectation
of
his
arrival
,
Elizabeth
could
easily
perceive
that
her
spirit
be
affect
by
it
.
<EOS>
They
be
more
disturbed
,
more
unequal
,
than
she
have
often
see
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
subject
which
have
be
so
warmly
canvass
between
their
parent
,
about
a
twelvemonth
ago
,
be
now
bring
forward
again

<EOS>
"
as
soon
as
ever
Mr.
Bingley
come
,
my
dear
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bennet
,
"
you
will
wait
on
him
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
.
<EOS>
You
force
me
into
visit
him
last
year
,
and
promise
if
I
go
to
see
him
,
he
should
marry
one
of
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
but
it
end
in
nothing
,
and
I
will
not
be
send
on
a
fool
's
errand
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
wife
represent
to
him
how
absolutely
necessary
such
an
attention
would
be
from
all
the
neighbouring
gentleman
,
on
his
return
to
Netherfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
'
tis
an
etiquette
I
despise

he

"
if
he
want
our
society

let
him
seek
it

He
know
where
we
live

I
will
not

my

hour

my

they
go
away

come
back
again

"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
all
I
know
be
,
that
it
will
be
abominably
rude
if
you
do
not
wait
on
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
however
,
that
shall
not
prevent
my
ask
him
to
dine
here
,
I
be
determined
.
<EOS>
We
must
have
Mrs.
Long
and
the
Gouldings
soon
.
<EOS>
that
will
make
thirteen
with
ourselves
,
so
there
will
be
just
room
at
table
for
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
console
by
this
resolution
,
she
be
the
better
able
to
bear
her
husband
's
incivility
;
though
it
be
very
mortifying
to
know
that
her
neighbour
may
all
see
Mr.
Bingley
in
consequence
of
it
,
before
_
they
_
do
.
<EOS>
as
the
day
of
his
arrival
draw
near
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
be
sorry
that
he
come
at
all
,
"
say
Jane
to
her
sister
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
nothing
;
I
could
see
him
with
perfect
indifference
,
but
I
can
hardly
bear
to
hear
it
thus
perpetually
talk
of
.
<EOS>
My
mother
mean
well
;
but
she
do
not
know
,
no
one
can
know
how
much
I
suffer
from
what
she
say
.
<EOS>
happy
shall
I
be
,
when
his
stay
at
Netherfield
be
over
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
say
any
thing
to
comfort
you
,
"
reply
Elizabeth
;
"
but
it
be
wholly
out
of
my
power
.
<EOS>
You
must
feel
it
;
and
the
usual
satisfaction
of
preach
patience
to
a
sufferer
be
deny
me
,
because
you
have
always
so
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bingley
arrive
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
,
through
the
assistance
of
servant
,
contrive
to
have
the
early
tiding
of
it
,
that
the
period
of
anxiety
and
fretfulness
on
her
side
,
may
be
as
long
as
it
could
.
<EOS>
She
count
the
day
that
must
intervene
before
their
invitation
could
be
send
;
hopeless
of
see
him
before
.
<EOS>
but
on
the
third
morning
after
his
arrival
in
Hertfordshire
,
she
see
him
from
her
dressing
-
room
window
,
enter
the
paddock
,
and
ride
towards
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Her
daughter
be
eagerly
call
to
partake
of
her
joy
.
<EOS>
Jane
resolutely
keep
her
place
at
the
table
;
but
Elizabeth
,
to
satisfy
her
mother
,
go
to
the
window
 
<EOS>
she
look
,
 
she
see
Mr.
Darcy
with
him
,
and
sit
down
again
by
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
gentleman
with
him
,
mamma
,
"
say
Kitty
;
"
who
can
it
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
some
acquaintance
or
other
,
my
dear
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
;
I
be
sure
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
La
!
"
reply
Kitty
,
"
it
look
just
like
that
man
that
use
to
be
with
him
before

Mr.
what
be
his
name

<EOS>
that
tall
,
proud
man

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
good
gracious
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
!
 
<EOS>
and
so
it
do
I
vow
.
<EOS>
well
,
any
friend
of
Mr.
Bingley
's
will
always
be
welcome
here
to
be
sure
;
but
else
I
must
say
that
I
hate
the
very
sight
of
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jane
look
at
Elizabeth
with
surprise
and
concern
.
<EOS>
She
know
but
little
of
their
meeting
in
Derbyshire
,
and
therefore
feel
for
the
awkwardness
which
must
attend
her
sister
,
in
see
him
almost
for
the
first
time
after
receive
his
explanatory
letter
.
<EOS>
both
sister
be
uncomfortable
enough
.
<EOS>
each
feel
for
the
other
,
and
of
course
for
themselves
;
and
their
mother
talk
on
,
of
her
dislike
of
Mr.
Darcy
,
and
her
resolution
to
be
civil
to
him
only
as
Mr.
Bingley
's
friend
,
without
be
hear
by
either
of
them
.
<EOS>
but
Elizabeth
have
source
of
uneasiness
which
could
not
be
suspect
by
Jane
,
to
whom
she
have
never
yet
have
courage
to
shew
Mrs.
Gardiner
's
letter
,
or
to
relate
her
own
change
of
sentiment
towards
him
.
<EOS>
to
Jane
,
he
could
be
only
a
man
whose
proposal
she
have
refuse
,
and
whose
merit
she
have
undervalue
;
but
to
her
own
more
extensive
information
,
he
be
the
person
,
to
whom
the
whole
family
be
indebte
for
the
first
of
benefit
,
and
whom
she
regard
herself
with
an
interest
,
if
not
quite
so
tender
,
at
least
as
reasonable
and
just
,
as
what
Jane
feel
for
Bingley
.
<EOS>
Her
astonishment
at
his
come
 
at
his
come
to
Netherfield
,
to
Longbourn
,
and
voluntarily
seek
her
again
,
be
almost
equal
to
what
she
have
know
on
first
witness
his
alter
behaviour
in
Derbyshire
.
  
<EOS>
the
colour
which
have
be
drive
from
her
face
,
return
for
half
a
minute
with
an
additional
glow
,
and
a
smile
of
delight
add
lustre
to
her
eye
,
as
she
think
for
that
space
of
time
,
that
his
affection
and
wish
must
still
be
unshaken
.
<EOS>
but
she
would
not
be
secure
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
me
first
see
how
he
behave
,
"
say
she
;
"
it
will
then
be
early
enough
for
expectation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
sit
intently
at
work
,
strive
to
be
compose
,
and
without
dare
to
lift
up
her
eye
,
till
anxious
curiosity
carry
them
to
the
face
of
her
sister
,
as
the
servant
be
approach
the
door
.
<EOS>
Jane
look
a
little
paler
than
usual
,
but
more
sedate
than
Elizabeth
have
expect
.
<EOS>
on
the
gentleman
's
appearing
,
her
colour
increase
;
yet
she
receive
them
with
tolerable
ease
,
and
with
a
propriety
of
behaviour
equally
free
from
any
symptom
of
resentment
,
or
any
unnecessary
complaisance
.
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
say
as
little
to
either
as
civility
would
allow
,
and
sit
down
again
to
her
work
,
with
an
eagerness
which
it
do
not
often
command
.
<EOS>
She
have
venture
only
one
glance
at
Darcy
.
<EOS>
He
look
serious
as
usual
;
and
she
think
,
more
as
he
have
be
use
to
look
in
Hertfordshire
,
than
as
she
have
see
him
at
Pemberley
.
<EOS>
but
,
perhaps
he
could
not
in
her
mother
's
presence
be
what
he
be
before
her
uncle
and
aunt
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
painful
,
but
not
an
improbable
,
conjecture
.
  
<EOS>
Bingley
,
she
have
likewise
see
for
an
instant
,
and
in
that
short
period
see
him
look
both
pleased
and
embarrassed
.
<EOS>
He
be
receive
by
Mrs.
Bennet
with
a
degree
of
civility
,
which
make
her
two
daughter
ashamed
,
especially
when
contrast
with
the
cold
and
ceremonious
politeness
of
her
curtsey
and
address
to
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
particularly
,
who
know
that
her
mother
owe
to
the
latter
the
preservation
of
her
favourite
daughter
from
irremediable
infamy
,
be
hurt
and
distress
to
a
most
painful
degree
by
a
distinction
so
ill
applied
.
  
<EOS>
Darcy
,
after
enquire
of
her
how
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Gardiner
do
,
a
question
which
she
could
not
answer
without
confusion
,
say
scarcely
any
thing
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
seat
by
her
;
perhaps
that
be
the
reason
of
his
silence
;
but
it
have
not
be
so
in
Derbyshire
.
<EOS>
there
he
have
talk
to
her
friend
,
when
he
could
not
to
herself
.
<EOS>
but
now
several
minute
elapse
,
without
bring
the
sound
of
his
voice
;
and
when
occasionally
,
unable
to
resist
the
impulse
of
curiosity
,
she
raise
her
eye
to
his
face
<EOS>
,
she
as
often
find
him
look
at
Jane
,
as
at
herself
,
and
frequently
on
no
object
but
the
ground
.
<EOS>
More
thoughtfulness
,
and
less
anxiety
to
please
than
when
they
last
meet
,
be
plainly
express
.
<EOS>
She
be
disappoint
,
and
angry
with
herself
for
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
Could
I
expect
it
to
be
otherwise
!
"
say
she
.
"
<EOS>
yet
why
do
he
come
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
in
no
humour
for
conversation
with
any
one
but
himself
;
and
to
him
she
have
hardly
courage
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
She
enquire
after
his
sister
,
but
could
do
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
long
time
,
Mr.
Bingley
,
since
you
go
away
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bennet
.
  
<EOS>
He
readily
agree
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
be
afraid
you
would
never
come
back
again
.
<EOS>
People
_
do
_
say
,
you
mean
to
quit
the
place
entirely
at
Michaelmas
;
but
,
however
,
I
hope
it
be
not
true
.
<EOS>
a
great
many
change
have
happen
in
the
neighbourhood
,
since
you
go
away
.
<EOS>
Miss
Lucas
be
marry
and
settle
.
<EOS>
and
one
of
my
own
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
have
hear
of
it
;
indeed
,
you
must
have
see
it
in
the
paper
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
Times
and
the
Courier
,
I
know
;
though
it
be
not
put
in
as
it
ought
to
be
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
say
,
"
lately
,
George
Wickham
,
Esq
.
to
Miss
Lydia
Bennet
,
"
without
there
be
a
syllable
say
of
her
father
,
or
the
place
where
she
live
,
or
any
thing
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
brother
Gardiner
's
draw
up
too
,
and
I
wonder
how
he
come
to
make
such
an
awkward
business
of
it
.
<EOS>
do
you
see
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Bingley
reply
that
he
do
,
and
make
his
congratulation
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
dare
not
lift
up
her
eye
.
<EOS>
how
Mr.
Darcy
look
,
therefore
,
she
could
not
tell
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
delightful
thing
,
to
be
sure
,
to
have
a
daughter
well
married

continue
her
mother

but
at
the
same
time
,
Mr.
Bingley
,
it
be
very
hard
to
have
her
take
such
a
way
from
me

<EOS>
They
be
go
down
to
Newcastle
,
a
place
quite
northward
,
it
seem
,
and
there
they
be
to
stay
,
I
do
not
know
how
long
.
<EOS>
His
regiment
be
there
;
for
I
suppose
you
have
hear
of
his
leave
the
shire
,

of
his

go
into
the
regular
.
<EOS>
thank
Heaven
!
<EOS>
he
have

some

perhaps
not
so
many

he
deserve

<EOS>
Elizabeth

who
know
this
to
be
level
at
Mr.
Darcy
,
be
in
such
misery
of
shame
,
that
she
could
hardly
keep
her
seat

<EOS>
It
draw
from
her
,
however
,
the
exertion
of
speaking
,
which
nothing
else
have
so
effectually
do
before
;
and
she
ask
Bingley
,
whether
he
mean
to
make
any
stay
in
the
country
at
present
.
<EOS>
a
few
week

"
when

Elizabeth

misery
increase

at
such
unnecessary
,
such
officious
attention

<EOS>
be
the

fair
prospect
to
arise
at
present
,
as
have
flatter
them
a
year
ago

every
thing

she
be
persuade

would
be
hasten

the

vexatious
conclusion

at
that

she
feel

that
year

happiness
could
not

Jane

such
painful

the

Their
society
can
afford
no
pleasure

that
will
atone
for
such
wretchedness
as
this

let

<EOS>
yet
the
misery

for
which
year

soon
afterwards
material
relief

how
much
the
beauty

the
admiration
of
her
former
lover

<EOS>
when
first
he
come
in

he
have
speak
to
her
but
little
;
but
every
five
minute
seem
to
be
give
her
more
of
his
attention

<EOS>
He
find
her
as
handsome
as
she
have
be
last
year
;
as
good
natured
,
and
as
unaffected
,
though
not
quite
so
chatty

Jane
be
anxious
that
no

be
perceive
in

all

be
really
persuade
that
she
talk
as
much
as
ever

but
her
mind
be
so
busily
engage
,
that
she
do
not
always
know
when
she
be
silent

<EOS>
when
the
gentleman
rise
to
go
away

Mrs.
Bennet
be
mindful
of
her
intend
civility

and
they

"
You

a
little
silly
at

something
of
his
concern

at
have
be
prevent

<EOS>
They
then
go
away

<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
have
be
strongly
inclined
to
ask
them
to
stay
and
dine
there
,
that
day
;
but
,
though
she
always
keep
a
very
good
table
,
she
do
not
think
any
thing
less
than
two
course
,
could
be
good
enough
for
a
man
,
on
whom
she
have
such
anxious
design
,
or
satisfy
the
appetite
and
pride
of
one
who
have
ten
thousand

<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
be
go
,
Elizabeth
walk
out
to
recover
her
spirit
;
or
in
other
word
,
to
dwell
without
interruption
on
those
subject
that
must
deaden
them
more
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
's
behaviour
astonish
and
vex
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
if
he
come
only
to
be
silent

grave
,
and
indifferent

she

"
do
he
come
at
all

"
  
<EOS>
She
could
settle
it
in
no

that
give
her
pleasure

He
could
be
still
amiable

still
pleasing

to
my
uncle

when
he
be
in

and
why
not
to
me

<EOS>
if
he
fear
me

why
come
hither

if
he
no

I
will

<EOS>
Her
resolution
be
for
a
short
time
involuntarily
keep
by
the
approach
of
her
sister
,
who
join
her
with
a
cheerful
look
,
which
shew
her
better
satisfied
with
their
visitor
,
than
Elizabeth

<EOS>
"
now
,
"
say
she
,
"
that
this
first
meeting

over

I
feel
perfectly
easy

I
know
my

and
I
shall
never
be
embarrass
again
by
his
coming

<EOS>
I
be
glad

here
on
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
It
will
then
be
publicly
see
,
that
on
both
side
,
we
meet
only
as
common
and
indifferent
acquaintance

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
very
indifferent
indeed
,
"
say
Elizabeth
,
laughingly
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Jane
,
take
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Lizzy
,
you
can
not
think
me
so
weak
,
as
to
be
in
danger
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
be
in
very
great
danger
of
make
him
as
much
in
love
with
you
as
ever

"
     
<EOS>
They
do
not
see
the
gentleman
again
till
Tuesday
;
and
Mrs.
Bennet
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
be
give
way
to
all
the
happy
scheme
,
which
the
good
humour
,
and
common
politeness
of
Bingley
,
in
half
an
hour
's
visit
,
have
revive
.
  
<EOS>
on
Tuesday
there
be
a
large
party
assemble
at
Longbourn
;
and
the
two
,
who
be
most
anxiously
expect
,
to
the
credit
of
their
punctuality
as
sportsman
,
be
in
very
good
time
.
<EOS>
when
they
repair
to
the
dining
-
room
,
Elizabeth
eagerly
watch
to
see
whether
Bingley
would
take
the
place
,
which
,
in
all
their
former
party
,
have
belong
to
him
,
by
her
sister
.
<EOS>
Her
prudent
mother
,
occupy
by
the
same
idea
,
forbore
to
invite
him
to
sit
by
herself
.
<EOS>
on
enter
the
room
,
he
seem
to
hesitate
;
but
Jane
happen
to
look
round
,
and
happen
to
smile
:
it
be
decide
.
<EOS>
He
place
himself
by
her
.
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
,
with
a
triumphant
sensation
,
look
towards
his
friend
.
<EOS>
He
bear
it
with
noble
indifference
,
and
she
would
have
imagine
that
Bingley
have
receive
his
sanction
to
be
happy
,
have
she
not
see
his
eye
likewise
turn
towards
Mr.
Darcy
,
with
an
expression
of
half
-
laugh
alarm
.
  
<EOS>
His
behaviour
to
her
sister
be
such
,
during
dinner
time
,
as
shew
an
admiration
of
her
,
which
,
though
more
guard
than
formerly
,
persuade
Elizabeth
,
that
if
leave
wholly
to
himself
,
Jane
's
happiness
,
and
his
own
,
would
be
speedily
secure
.
<EOS>
though
she
dare
not
depend
upon
the
consequence
,
she
yet
receive
pleasure
from
observe
his
behaviour
.
<EOS>
It
give
her
all
the
animation
that
her
spirit
could
boast
;
for
she
be
in
no
cheerful
humour
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Darcy
be
almost
as
far
from
her
,
as
the
table
could
divide
them
.
<EOS>
He
be
on
one
side
of
her
mother
.
<EOS>
She
know
how
little
such
a
situation
would
give
pleasure
to
either
,
or
make
either
appear
to
advantage
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
near
enough
to
hear
any
of
their
discourse
,
but
she
could
see
how
seldom
they
speak
to
each
other
,
and
how
formal
and
cold
be
their
manner
,
whenever
they
do
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
's
ungraciousness
,
make
the
sense
of
what
they
owe
him
more
painful
to
Elizabeth
's
mind
;
and
she
would
,
at
time
,
have
give
any
thing
to
be
privilege
to
tell
him
,
that
his
kindness
be
neither
unknown
nor
unfelt
by
the
whole
of
the
family
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
in
hope
that
the
evening
would
afford
some
opportunity
of
bring
them
together
;
that
the
whole
of
the
visit
would
not
pass
away
without
enable
them
to
enter
into
something
more
of
conversation
,
than
the
mere
ceremonious
salutation
attend
his
entrance
.
<EOS>
anxious
and
uneasy
,
the
period
which
pass
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
before
the
gentleman
come
,
be
wearisome
and
dull
to
a
degree
,
that
almost
make
her
uncivil
.
<EOS>
She
look
forward
to
their
entrance
,
as
the
point
on
which
all
her
chance
of
pleasure
for
the
evening
must
depend
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
he
do
not
come
to
me
,
_
then
_
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
shall
give
him
up
for
ever

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
gentleman
come
;
and
she
think
he
look
as
if
he
would
have
answer
her
hope
;
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
the
lady
have
crowd
round
the
table
,
where
Miss
Bennet
be
make
tea
,
and
Elizabeth
pour
out
the
coffee
,
in
so
close
a
confederacy
,
that
there
be
not
a
single
vacancy
near
her
,
which
would
admit
of
a
chair
.
<EOS>
and
on
the
gentleman
's
approaching
,
one
of
the
girl
move
closer
to
her
than
ever
,
and
say
,
in
a
whisper
,
  
<EOS>
"
the
man
shall
not
come
and
part
us
,
I
be
determined
.
<EOS>
We
want
none
of
them
;
do
we
?
"
  
<EOS>
Darcy
have
walk
away
to
another
part
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
She
follow
him
with
her
eye
,
envy
every
one
to
whom
he
speak
,
have
scarcely
patience
enough
to
help
anybody
to
coffee
;
and
then
be
enrage
against
herself
for
be
so
silly
!
  
<EOS>
"
a
man
who
have
once
be
refuse
!
<EOS>
how
could
I
ever
be
foolish
enough
to
expect
a
renewal
of
his
love
?
<EOS>
be
there
one
among
the
sex
,
who
would
not
protest
against
such
a
weakness
as
a
second
proposal
to
the
same
woman
?
<EOS>
there
be
no
indignity
so
abhorrent
to
their
feeling
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
a
little
revive
,
however
,
by
his
bring
back
his
coffee
cup
himself
;
and
she
seize
the
opportunity
of
say
,
  
<EOS>
"
be
your
sister
at
Pemberley
still
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
she
will
remain
there
till
Christmas
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
and
quite
alone
?
<EOS>
have
all
her
friend
leave
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Annesley
be
with
her
.
<EOS>
the
other
have
be
go
on
to
Scarborough
,
these
three
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
could
think
of
nothing
more
to
say
;
but
if
he
wish
to
converse
with
her
,
he
may
have
well
success
.
<EOS>
He
stand
by
her
,
however
,
for
some
minute
,
in
silence
;
and
,
at
last
,
on
the
young
lady
be
whispering
to
Elizabeth
again
,
he
walk
away
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
tea
-
thing
be
remove
,
and
the
card
table
place
,
the
lady
all
rise
,
and
Elizabeth
be
then
hope
to
be
soon
join
by
him
,
when
all
her
view
be
overthrow
,
by
see
him
fall
a
victim
to
her
mother
's
rapacity
for
whist
player
,
and
in
a
few
moment
after
seat
with
the
rest
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
She
now
lose
every
expectation
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
They
be
confine
for
the
evening
at
different
table
,
and
she
have
nothing
to
hope
,
but
that
his
eye
be
so
often
turn
towards
her
side
of
the
room
,
as
to
make
him
play
as
unsuccessfully
as
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
have
design
to
keep
the
two
netherfield
gentleman
to
supper
;
but
their
carriage
be
unluckily
order
before
any
of
the
other
,
and
she
have
no
opportunity
of
detain
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
girl
,
"
say
she
,
as
soon
as
they
be
leave
to
themselves
,
"
what
say
you
to
the
day
?
<EOS>
I
think
every
thing
have
pass
off
uncommonly
well
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
the
dinner
be
as
well
dress
as
any
I
ever
see
.
<EOS>
the
venison
be
roast
to
a
turn
 
<EOS>
and
everybody
say
,
they
never
see
so
fat
a
haunch
.
<EOS>
the
soup
be
fifty
time
well
than
what
we
have
at
the
Lucas
's
last
week
;
and
even
Mr.
Darcy
acknowledge
,
that
the
partridge
be
remarkably
well
do
;
and
I
suppose
he
have
two
or
three
french
cook
at
least
.
<EOS>
and
,
my
dear
Jane
,
I
never
see
you
look
in
great
beauty
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Long
say
so
too
,
for
I
ask
her
whether
you
do
not
.
<EOS>
and
what
do
you
think
she
say
besides
?
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
,
we
shall
have
her
at
Netherfield
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
She
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
do
think
Mrs.
Long
be
as
good
a
creature
as
ever
live
 
and
her
niece
be
very
pretty
behaved
girl
,
and
not
at
all
handsome

I
like
them
prodigiously
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
,
in
short
,
be
in
very
great
spirit
;
she
have
see
enough
of
Bingley
's
behaviour
to
Jane
,
to
be
convince
that
she
would
get
him
at
last
;
and
her
expectation
of
advantage
to
her
family
,
when
in
a
happy
humour
,
be
so
far
beyond
reason
,
that
she
be
quite
disappointed
at
not
see
him
there
again
the
next
day
,
to
make
his
proposal
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
have
be
a
very
agreeable
day

say
Miss
Bennet
to
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
"
the
party
seem
so
well
select

so
suitable
one
with
the
other

hope
we
may
often
meet
again

Lizzy
,
you
must
not
do
so

You
must
not
suspect
me

It
mortify
me

I
assure
you
that
I
have
now
learn
to
enjoy
his
conversation
as
an
agreeable
and
sensible
young
man
,
without
have
a
wish
beyond
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
perfectly
satisfied
from
what
his
manner
now
be
,
that
he
never
have
any
design
of
engage
my
affection
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
that
he
be
bless
with
great
sweetness
of
address

and
a
strong
desire
of
generally
pleasing
than
any
other
man

<EOS>
"
You
be
very
cruel
,
"
say
her
sister

you
will
not
let
me
smile

be
provoke
me
to
it
every
moment

"
how
hard
it
be
in
some
case
to
be
believe
!

and
how
impossible
in
other
!
<EOS>

<EOS>

but
why
should
you
wish
to
persuade
me
that
I
feel
more
than
I
acknowledge

"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
question
which
I
hardly
know
how
to
answer

<EOS>
We
all
love
to
instruct

though
we
can
teach
only
what
be
not
worth
know

<EOS>
forgive
me

if
you
persist
in
indifference

do
not
make

me

your
confidante

<EOS>
a
few
day
after
this
visit

Mr.
Bingley
call
again

alone

<EOS>
His

leave
him

morning

London

He
should
be
particularly
happy
at

leave

would
take

Can

but
when
her
mother

,
Jane
would
not
be
prevail
on
to
go
down
without
one
of
her

<EOS>
the
same
anxiety
to
get

be
visible
again
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
after
tea

Mr.

and

at
Elizabeth
and
Catherine
for
a
considerable
time
,
without
make
any
impression
on
them
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
would
not
observe
her
;
and
when
at
last
Kitty
do
,
she
very
innocently
say
,
"
what

<EOS>
what

I

She

but
unable
to
waste
such
a
precious
occasion
,
she
suddenly
get
up
,
and
say
to
Kitty
<EOS>
,
  
"

I
want

Jane

give
a
look
at
Elizabeth

her
distress
at
such
premeditation
,
and
her
intreaty
that

would
not

<EOS>
in
a

minute

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Kitty
and
I
be
go
upstairs
to
sit
in
my
dressing
-
room

"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
make
no
attempt
to
reason
with
her
mother
,
but
remain
quietly
in
the
hall
,
till
she
and
Kitty
be
out
of
sight
,
then
return
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
's
scheme
for
this
day
be
ineffectual
.
<EOS>
Bingley
be
every
thing
that
be
charming
,
except
the
professed
lover
of
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
His
ease
and
cheerfulness
render
him
a
most
agreeable
addition
to
their
evening
party
;
and
he
bear
with
the
ill
-
judge
officiousness
of
the
mother
,
and
hear
all
her
silly
remark
with
a
forbearance
and
command
of
countenance
,
particularly
grateful
to
the
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
He
scarcely
need
an
invitation
to
stay
supper
;
and
before
he
go
away
,
an
engagement
be
form
,
chiefly
through
his
own
and
Mrs.
Bennet
's
mean
,
for
his
come
next
morning
to
shoot
with
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
after
this
day
,
Jane
say
no
more
of
her
indifference
.
<EOS>
not
a
word
pass
between
the
sister
concern
Bingley
;
but
Elizabeth
go
to
bed
in
the
happy
belief
that
all
must
speedily
be
conclude
,
unless
Mr.
Darcy
return
within
the
state
time
.
<EOS>
seriously
,
however
,
she
feel
tolerably
persuade
that
all
this
must
have
take
place
with
that
gentleman
's
concurrence
.
  
<EOS>
Bingley
be
punctual
to
his
appointment
;
and
he
and
Mr.
Bennet
spend
the
morning
together
,
as
have
be
agree
on
.
<EOS>
the
latter
be
much
more
agreeable
than
his
companion
expect
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
of
presumption
or
folly
in
Bingley
,
that
could
provoke
his
ridicule
,
or
disgust
him
into
silence
;
and
he
be
more
communicative
,
and
less
eccentric
than
the
other
have
ever
see
him
.
<EOS>
Bingley
of
course
return
with
him
to
dinner
;
and
in
the
evening
Mrs.
Bennet
's
invention
be
again
at
work
to
get
every
body
away
from
him
and
her
daughter

<EOS>
Elizabeth
,
who
have
a
letter
to
write
,
go
into
the
breakfast
room
for
that
purpose
soon
after
tea
;
for
as
the
other
be
all
go
to
sit
down
to
card
,
she
could
not
be
want
to
counteract
her
mother

scheme

<EOS>
but
on
return
to
the
drawing

room
,
when
her
letter
be
finish
,
she
see
,
to
her
infinite
surprise
,
there
be
reason
to
fear
that
her
mother
have
be
too
ingenious
for
her
.
<EOS>
on
open
the
door
,
she
perceive
her
sister
and
Bingley
stand
together
over
the
hearth
,
as
if
engage
in
earnest
conversation
;
and
have
this
lead
to
no
suspicion
,
the
face
of
both
as
they
hastily
turn
round
,
and
move
away
from
each
other
,
would
have
tell
it
all
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Their

situation
be
awkward
enough
;
but

<EOS>
she
think
be
still
bad
.
<EOS>
not
a
syllable
be
utter
by
either
;
and
Elizabeth
be
on
the
point
of
go
away
again
,
when
Bingley
,
who
as
well
as
the
other
have
sit
down
,
suddenly
rise
,
and
whisper
a
few
word
to
her
sister
,
run
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Jane
could
have
no
reserve
from
Elizabeth
,
where
confidence
would
give
pleasure
;
and
instantly
embrace
her
,
acknowledge
,
with
the
lively
emotion
,
that
she
be
the
happy
creature
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
"

too
much

"
<EOS>
she
add
,
"
by
far
too
much

<EOS>
I
do
not
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
why
be
not
every
body
as
happy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
's
congratulation
be
give
with
a
sincerity
,
a
warmth
,
a
delight
,
which
word
could
but
poorly
express
.
<EOS>
every
sentence
of
kindness
be
a
fresh
source
of
happiness
to
Jane
.
<EOS>
but
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
stay
with
her
sister
,
or
say
half
that
remain
to
be
say
,
for
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
instantly
to
my
mother
;
"
she
cry
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
on
any
account
trifle
with
her
affectionate
solicitude
;
or
allow
her
to
hear
it
from
any
one
but
myself
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
to
my
father
already
.
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
Lizzy
,
to
know
that
what
I
have
to
relate
will
give
such
pleasure
to
all
my
dear
family
!
<EOS>
how
shall
I
bear
so
much
happiness
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
then
hasten
away
to
her
mother
,
who
have
purposely
break
up
the
card
party
,
and
be
sit
up
stair
with
Kitty

<EOS>
Elizabeth
,
who
be

by
herself
,
now
smile
at
the
rapidity
and
ease
with
which
an
affair
be
finally
settle
,
that
have
give
them
so
many
previous
month
of
suspense
and
vexation
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
this
,
"
say
she
,
"
be
the
end
of
all
his
friend
's
anxious
circumspection
!
<EOS>
of
all
his
sister
's
falsehood
and
contrivance
!
<EOS>
the
happy
,
wise
,
most
reasonable
end
!
"
  
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
she
be
join
by
Bingley
,
whose
conference
with
her
father
have
be
short
and
to
the
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
your
sister
?
"
say
he
hastily
,
as
he
open
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
with
my
mother
up
stair
.
<EOS>
She
will
be
down
in
a
moment
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
then
shut
the
door
,
and
come
up
to
her
,
claim
the
good
wish
and
affection
of
a
sister
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
honestly
and
heartily
express
her
delight
in
the
prospect
of
their
relationship
.
<EOS>
They
shake
hand
with
great
cordiality
;
and
then
till
her
sister
come
down
,
she
have
to
listen
to
all
he
have
to
say
,
of
his
own
happiness
,
and
of
Jane
's
perfection
;
and
in
spite
of
his
be
a
lover
,
Elizabeth
really
believe
all
his
expectation
of
felicity
,
to
be
rationally
found
,
because
they
have
for
basis
the
excellent
understanding
,
and
super
-
excellent
disposition
of
Jane
,
and
a
general
similarity
of
feeling
and
taste
between
her
and
himself
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
an
evening
of
no
common
delight
to
them
all
;
the
satisfaction
of
Miss
Bennet
's
mind
give
a
glow
of
such
sweet
animation
to
her
face
,
as
make
her
look
handsome
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Kitty
simper
and
smile
,
and
hope
her
turn
be
come
soon
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
could
not
give
her
consent
,
or
speak
her
approbation
in
term
warm
enough
to
satisfy
her
feeling
,
though
she
talk
to
Bingley
of
nothing
else
,
for
half
an
hour
;
and
when
Mr.
Bennet
join
them
at
supper
,
his
voice
and
manner
plainly
shew
how
really
happy
he
be
.
  
<EOS>
not
a
word
,
however
,
pass
his
lip
in
allusion
to
it
,
till
their
visitor
take
his
leave
for
the
night
;
but
as
soon
as
he
be
go
,
he
turn
to
his
daughter
and
say
,
  
"
Jane
,
I
congratulate
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
a
very
happy
woman
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jane
go
to
him
instantly
,
kiss
him
,
and
thank
him
for
his
goodness
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
good
girl
;
"
he
reply
,
"
and
I
have
great
pleasure
in
think
you
will
be
so
happily
settle

<EOS>
I
have
not
a
doubt
of
your

very
well

<EOS>
Your
temper

by
no
means
unlike

<EOS>
You
be
each
of
you
so
comply
,
that
nothing
will
ever
be

on
;
so
easy
,
that
every
servant
will
cheat
you
;
and
so
generous
,
that
you
will
always
exceed
your
income
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
so
.
<EOS>
imprudence
or
thoughtlessness
in
money
matter

would
be
unpardonable
in
_
me

<EOS>

My

<EOS>
why

four
or
five
thousand

very
likely
more

"
<EOS>
then
address
her
daughter
,
"
oh

<EOS>
my

dear
Jane

I

so
happy

<EOS>
I

sure
I

sleep
all
night

I
know
how
it

<EOS>
I
always

it
must
be
so

at
last

<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
could
not
be
so
beautiful
for
nothing

<EOS>
I
remember
,
as
soon
as
ever
I
see
him
,
when
he
first
come
into
Hertfordshire
last
year
,
I
think
how
likely
it
be
that
you
should
come
together
.
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
he
be
the
handsome
young
man
that
ever

<EOS>
Wickham
,
Lydia
,
be
all

<EOS>
Jane
be
beyond
competition
her
favourite
child
.
<EOS>
at
that
moment
,
she
care
for
no
other
.
<EOS>
Her
young
sister
soon
begin
to
make
interest
with
her
for
object
of
happiness
which
she
may
in
future
be
able
to
dispense
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
petition
for
the
use
of
the
library
at
Netherfield
;
and
Kitty
beg
very
hard
for
a
few
ball
there
every
winter
.
  
<EOS>
Bingley
,
from
this
time
,
be
of
course
a
daily
visitor
at
Longbourn
;
come
frequently
before
breakfast
,
and
always
remain
till
after
supper
;
unless
when
some
barbarous
neighbour
,
who
could
not
be
enough
detest
,
have
give
him
an
invitation
to
dinner
,
which
he
think
himself
oblige
to
accept
.
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
have
now
but
<EOS>
little
time
for
conversation
with
her
sister
;
for
while
he
be
present
,
Jane
have
no
attention
to
bestow
on
any
one
else
;
but
she
find
herself
considerably
useful
to
both
of
them
,
in
those
hour
of
separation
that
must
sometimes
occur
.
<EOS>
in
the
absence
of
Jane
,
he
always
attach
himself
to
Elizabeth
,
for
the
pleasure
of
talk
of
her
;
and
when
Bingley
be
go
,
Jane
constantly
seek
the
same
mean
of
relief
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
make
me
so
happy
,
"
say
she
,
one
evening
,
"
by
tell
me
,
that
he
be
totally
ignorant
of
my
being
in
town
last
spring
!
<EOS>
I
have
not
believe
it
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
as
much
,
"
reply
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
"
but
how
do
he
account
for
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
must
have
be
his
sister
's
do
.
<EOS>
They
be
certainly
no
friend
to
his
acquaintance
with
me
,
which
I
can
not
wonder
at
,
since
he
may
have
choose
so
much
more
advantageously
in
many
respect
.
<EOS>
but
when
they
see
,
as
I
trust
they
will
,
that
their
brother
be
happy
with
me
,
they
will
learn
to
be
content
,
and
we
shall
be
on
good
term
again
;
though
we
can
never
be
what
we
once
be
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
most
unforgiving
speech
,
"
say
Elizabeth
,
"
that
I
ever
hear
you
utter
.
<EOS>
good
girl
!
<EOS>
It
would
vex
me
,
indeed
,
to
see
you
again
the
dupe
of
Miss
Bingley
's
pretended
regard
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
you
believe
it
,
Lizzy
,
that
when
he
go
to
town
last
November
,
he
really
love
me
,
and
nothing
but
a
persuasion
of
_
my
_
be
indifferent
,
would
have
prevent
his
come
down
again
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
make
a
little
mistake
to
be
sure
;
but
it
be
to
the
credit
of
his
modesty
.

<EOS>
this
naturally

one
morning

about

after
Bingley

suddenly
draw

,
by
the
sound
of
a
carriage
;

they
perceive
a
chaise
and
four
drive
up
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
It
be
too
early
in
the
morning
for

and
besides

do
not

the
horse

post

neither

It

their
astonishment
be
beyond
their
expectation
;

on
the
part
of
Mrs.
Bennet

though
she
be
perfectly
unknown
to

even
inferior
to

She
enter
the
room
with
an
air
more
than

ungracious
,
make
no

reply
to

than
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head

Elizabeth
have
mention

Mrs.

not

decline

any

then
rise
up
,
say
to
Elizabeth

<EOS>
Elizabeth
make
no

and
without
attempt

to
return
into

walk
quietly
into
it
herself

<EOS>
She
hear
the

drive
away

proceed
up

<EOS>
Her
mother
impatiently
meet
her
at

to
ask
why

rest
herself

She
be
a
very
fine

look
woman

her
calling
here
be
prodigiously
civil
!

for
she
only
come
,
I
suppose
,
to
tell
us
the
Collinses
be
well

<EOS>
She
be
on
her
road
somewhere
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
and
so
pass
through
Meryton
,
think
she
may
as
well
call
on
you
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
have
nothing
particular
to
say
to
you
,
Lizzy
?
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
force
to
give
into
a
little
falsehood
here
;
for
to
acknowledge
the
substance
of
their
conversation
be
impossible
.
    
<EOS>
the
discomposure
of
spirit
,
which
this
extraordinary
visit
throw
Elizabeth
into
,
could
not
be
easily
overcome
;
nor
could
she
for
many
hour
,
learn
to
think
of
it
less
than
incessantly
.
<EOS>
Lady
Catherine
it
appear
,
have
actually
take
the
trouble
of
this
journey
from
Rosings
,
for
the
sole
purpose
of
break
off
her
suppose
engagement
with
Mr.
Darcy
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
rational
scheme
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
but
from
what
the
report
of
their
engagement
could
originate
,
Elizabeth
be
at
a
loss
to
imagine
;
till
she
recollect
that
_
his
_
be
the
intimate
friend
of
Bingley
,
and
_
her
_
be
the
sister
of
Jane
,
be
enough
,
at
a
time
when
the
expectation
of
one
wedding
,
make
every
body
eager
for
another
,
to
supply
the
idea
.
<EOS>
She
have
not
herself
forget
to
feel
that
the
marriage
of
her
sister
must
bring
them
more
frequently
together
.
<EOS>
and
her
neighbour
at
Lucas
lodge
,
therefore
,
(
for
through
their
communication
with
the
Collinses
,
the
report
she
conclude
have
reach
lady
Catherine
)
have
only
set
_
that
_
down
,
as
almost
certain
and
immediate
,
which
_
she
_
have
look
forward
to
as
possible
,
at
some
future
time
.
  
<EOS>
in
revolve
lady
Catherine
's
expression
,
however
,
she
could
not
help
feel
some
uneasiness
as
to
the
possible
consequence
of
her
persisting
in
this
interference
.
<EOS>
from
what
she
have
say
of
her
resolution
to
prevent
their
marriage
,
it
occur
to
Elizabeth
that
she
must
meditate
an
application
to
her
nephew
;
and
how
_
he
_
may
take
a
similar
representation
of
the
evil
attach
to
a
connection
with
her
,
she
dare
not
pronounce
.
<EOS>
She
know
not
the
exact
degree
of
his
affection
for
his
aunt
,
or
his
dependence
on
her
judgment
,
but
it
be
natural
to
suppose
that
he
think
much
high
of
her
ladyship
than
_
<EOS>
she
_
could
do
;
and
it
be
certain
,
that
in
enumerate
the
misery
of
a
marriage
with
_
one
_
,
whose
immediate
connection
be
so
unequal
to
his
own
,
his
aunt
would
address
him
on
his
weak
side
.
<EOS>
with
his
notion
of
dignity
,
he
would
probably
feel
that
the
argument
,
which
to
Elizabeth
have
appear
weak
and
ridiculous
,
contain
much
good
sense
and
solid
reasoning
.
  
<EOS>
if
he
have
be
waver
before
,
as
to
what
he
should
do
,
which
have
often
seem
likely
,
the
advice
and
intreaty
of
so
near
a
relation
may
settle
every
doubt
,
and
determine
him
at
once
to
be
as
happy
,
as
dignity
unblemishe
could
make
him
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
he
would
return
no
more
.
<EOS>
Lady
Catherine
may
see
him
in
her
way
through
town
;
and
his
engagement
to
Bingley
of
come
again
to
Netherfield
must
give
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
,
therefore
,
an
excuse
for
not
keep
his
promise
,
should
come
to
his
friend
within
a
few
day
,
"
she
add
,
"
I
shall
know
how
to
understand
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
then
give
over
every
expectation
,
every
wish
of
his
constancy
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
satisfied
with
only
regret
me
,
when
he
may
have
obtain
my
affection
and
hand
,
I
shall
soon
cease
to
regret
him
at
all
.
"
     
<EOS>
the
surprise
of
the
rest
of
the
family
,
on
hear
who
their
visitor
have
be
,
be
very
great
;
but
they
obligingly
satisfy
it
,
with
the
same
kind
of
supposition
,
which
have
appease
Mrs.
Bennet
's
curiosity
;
and
Elizabeth
be
spare
from
much
teazing
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
morning
,
as
she
be
go
down
stair
,
she
be
meet
by
her
father
,
who
come
out
of
his
library
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lizzy
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
be
go
to
look
for
you
;
come
into
my
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
follow
him
thither
;
and
her
curiosity
to
know
what
he
have
to
tell
her
,
be
heighten
by
the
supposition
of
its
being
in
some
manner
connect
with
the
letter
he
hold
.
<EOS>
It
suddenly
strike
her
that
it
may
be
from
lady
Catherine
;
and
she
anticipate
with
dismay
all
the
consequent
explanation
.
  
<EOS>
She
follow
her
father
to
the
fire
place
,
and
they
both
sit
down
.
<EOS>
He
then
say
,
  
"
I
have
receive
a
letter
this
morning
that
have
astonish
me
exceedingly

<EOS>
the
colour
now
rush
into
Elizabeth
's
cheek
in
the
instantaneous
conviction
of
its
be
a
letter
from
the
nephew
,
instead
of
the
aunt
;
and
<EOS>
she
be
undetermined
whether
most
to
be
pleased
that
he
explain
himself
at
all
,
or
offend
that
his
letter
be
not

address
to
herself

when
her
father
continue

of
what

now

Could

pitch
on

Mr.

to
see
a
blemish

who
probably
never

It
be
admirable
!

<EOS>
Elizabeth
try
to
join
in
her
father
's
pleasantry

could
only
force
one
most
reluctant
smile

<EOS>
never
have
his

"
  
<EOS>
"
after
mention
the
likelihood
of
this
marriage
to
her
ladyship
last
night

she
immediately
,
with
her
usual
condescension
,
express
what
she
feel
on
the
occasion

when
it
become
apparent

that
on

family
objection
on
the
part
of
my

she
would
never
give
her
consent

term
so
disgraceful
a
match

I
think
it
my
duty
to
give
the
speedy
intelligence
of
this
to
my
cousin

that
she
and
her
noble
admirer
may
be
aware

truly
rejoice

declare
my
amazement

at
hear
that
you
receive
the
young
couple
into
your
house

soon

<EOS>
It

an
encouragement

have
I

the
rector
of
Longbourn

I
should
very
strenuously

You

nothing

_
his

perfect
indifference

your

make
it
so
delightfully
absurd

<EOS>
much
as
I
abominate
writing

I
would
not
give
up
Mr.

correspondence
for

nay

when
I

a
letter

I
can
not

give
him
the
preference

and
pray
,
Lizzy
,
what
say
Lady

about
this
report

do
she
call

refuse

consent

"
  
<EOS>
to
this
question
his
daughter
reply
only
with
a
laugh
;
and
as
it
have
be
ask
without
the

suspicion
,
she
be
not
distress
by
his
repeat
it

<EOS>
Elizabeth
have
never
be
more
at
a
loss
to
make
her
feeling
appear
what
they
be
not

<EOS>
It
be
necessary
to
laugh
,
when
she
would
rather
have
cry
.
<EOS>
Her
father
have
most
cruelly
mortify
her
,
by
what
he
say
of
Mr.
Darcy
's
indifference
,
and
she
could
do
nothing

wonder
at
such
a
want
of
penetration

fear
that
perhaps
,
instead
of
his
see
too
<EOS>
_
little
_
,
she
may
have
fancy
too
_
much

<EOS>
instead
of
receive
any
such
letter
of
excuse
from
his
friend
,
as
Elizabeth
half
expect
Mr.
Bingley
to
do
,
he
be
able
to
bring
Darcy
with
him
to
Longbourn
before
many
day
have
pass
after
Lady
Catherine
's
visit
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
arrive
early
;
and
,
before
Mrs.
Bennet
have
time
to
tell
him
of
their
have
see
his
aunt
,
of
which
her
daughter
sit
in
momentary
dread
,
Bingley
,
who
want
to
be
alone
with
Jane

propose
their
all
walk
out
.
<EOS>
It
be
agree
to
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bennet
be
not
in
the
habit
of
walk
,
Mary
could
never
spare
time
,
but
the
remain
five
set
off
together
.
<EOS>
Bingley
and
Jane
,
however
,
soon
allow
the
other
to
outstrip
them
.
<EOS>
They
lag
behind
,
while
Elizabeth
,
Kitty
,
and
Darcy
,
be
to
entertain
each
other
.
<EOS>
very
little
be
say
by
either
;
Kitty
be
too
much
afraid
of
him
to
talk
;
Elizabeth
be
secretly
form
a
desperate
resolution
;
and
perhaps
he
may
be
do
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
They
walk
towards
the
Lucases
,
because
Kitty
wish
to
call
upon
Maria
;
and
as
Elizabeth
see
no
occasion
for
make
it
a
general
concern
,
when
Kitty
leave
them
,
she
go
boldly
on
with
him
alone
.
<EOS>
now
be
the
moment
for
her
resolution
to
be
execute
,
and
,
while
her
courage
be
high
,
she
immediately
say
,
  
"
Mr.
Darcy
,
I
be
a
very
selfish
creature
;

,
for
the
sake
of
give
relief
to
my
own
feeling

care
not
how
much
I
may
be
wound
your
's
.

I
can
no
longer
help
thank
you
for
your
unexampled
kindness
to
my
poor
sister
.

ever
since
I
have
know
it

I
have
be
most
anxious
to
acknowledge
to
you
how
gratefully
I
feel
it
.

be
it
known
to
the
rest
of
my
family
,
I
should
not
have
merely
my
own
gratitude
to
express
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
,
exceedingly
sorry
,
"
reply
Darcy
,
in
a
tone
of
surprise
and
emotion
,
"
that
you
have
ever
be
inform
of
what
may
,
in
a
mistaken
light
,
have
give
you
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
Mrs.
Gardiner
be
so
little
to
be
trust
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
blame
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
Lydia
's
thoughtlessness
first
betray
to
me
that
you
have
be
concern
in
the
matter
;
and
,
of
course
,
I
could
not
rest
till
I
know
the
particular
.
<EOS>
let
me
thank
you
again
and
again
,
in
the
name
of
all
my
family
,
for
that
generous
compassion
which
induce
you
to
take
so
much
trouble
,
and
bear
so
many
mortification
,
for
the
sake
of
discover
them
.

<EOS>
"
if
you
_
will
_
thank
me

"
he
reply
,
"
let
it
be
for
yourself
alone

<EOS>
that
the
wish
of
give
happiness
to
you
,
may
add
force
to
the
other
inducement
which
lead
me
on
,
I
shall
not
attempt
to
deny
.
<EOS>
but
your
_

_
owe
me
nothing
.
<EOS>
much
as
I
respect
them
,
I
believe

I
think
only
of
_
you

.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
be
too
much
embarrassed
to
say
a
word
.
<EOS>
after
a
short
pause
,
her
companion
add
,
"
You
be
too
generous
to
trifle
with
me
.
<EOS>
if
your
feeling
be
still
what
they
be
last
April

tell
me
so
at
once
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
My
_
affection
and
wish
be
unchanged
,
but
one
word
from
you
will
silence
me
on
this
subject
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
feel
all
the
more
than
common
awkwardness
and
anxiety
of
his
situation
,
now
force
herself
to
speak
;
and
immediately
,
though
not
very
fluently
,
give
him
to
understand
,
that
her
sentiment
have
undergo
so
material
a
change
,
since
the
period
to
which
he
allude
,
as
to
make
her
receive
with
gratitude
and
pleasure
,
his
present
assurance
.
<EOS>
the
happiness
which
this
reply
produce
,
be
such
as
he
have
probably
never
feel
before
;
and
he
express
himself
on
the
occasion
as
sensibly
and
as
warmly
as
a
man
violently
in
love
can
be
suppose
to
do
.
<EOS>
have
Elizabeth
be
able
to
encounter
his
eye
,
she
may
have
see
how
well
the
expression
of
heart
-
feel
delight
,
diffuse
over
his
face
,
become
him
;
but
,
though
she
could
not
look
,
she
could
listen
,
and
he
tell
her
of
feeling
,
which
,
in
prove
of
what
importance
<EOS>
she
be
to
him
,
make
his
affection
every
moment
more
valuable
.
  
<EOS>
They
walk
on
,
without
know
in
what
direction
.
<EOS>
there
be
too
much
to
be
think
;
and
feel
,
and
say
,
for
attention
to
any
other
object
.
<EOS>
She
soon
learn
that
they
be
indebte
for
their
present
good
understanding
to
the
effort
of
his
aunt
,
who
_
do
_
call
on
him
in
her
return
through
London
,
and
there
relate
her
journey
to
Longbourn
,
its
motive
,
and
the
substance
of
her
conversation
with
Elizabeth
;
dwell
emphatically
on
every
expression
of
the
latter
,
which
,
in
her
ladyship
's
apprehension
,
peculiarly
denote
her
perverseness
and
assurance
,
in
the
belief
that
such
a
relation
must
assist
her
endeavour
to
obtain
that
promise
from
her
nephew
,
which
_
she
_
have
refuse
to
give
.
<EOS>
but
,
unluckily
for
her
ladyship
,
its
effect
have
be
exactly
contrariwise

<EOS>
"
It
teach
me
to
hope

say
he
,
"
as
I
have
scarcely
ever
allow
myself
to
hope
before

I
know
enough
of
your
disposition
to
be
certain

that

have
you
be
absolutely

irrevocably
decide
against

you
would
have
acknowledge
it

frankly

openly

Elizabeth
colour
and
laugh
as
she
reply
,
"
yes

you
know
enough
of
my

frankness

so
abominably

found

form
on
mistaken
premise

my
behaviour
to
you
at
the
time

have
merit
the
severest
reproof
.
<EOS>
It
be
unpardonable

<EOS>
I
can
not
think
of
it
without
abhorrence
.

<EOS>
"
We
will
not
quarrel
for
the
great
share
of
blame
annex
to
that
evening
,
"
say
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
"
the
conduct
of
neither
,
if
strictly
examine
,
will
be
irreproachable
;
but
since
then
,
we
have
both
,
I
hope
,
improve
in
civility
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
be
so
easily
reconcile
to
myself

<EOS>
the
recollection

conduct

manner

expression

the
whole
of
it

be
now

have
be
many
month

inexpressibly
painful

me

Your
reproof

so
well
apply
,
I
shall
never
forget
:
"
have
you
behave
in
a
more
gentleman

like
manner

"
those
be
your
word

<EOS>
You
know
not
,
you
can
scarcely
conceive
,
how
they
have
torture
me
;
 
though
it
be
some
time
<EOS>
,
I
confess
,
before
I
be
reasonable
enough
to
allow
their
justice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
certainly
very
far
from
expect
them
to
make
so
strong
an
impression
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
small
idea
of
their
being
ever
feel
in
such
a
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
easily
believe
it
.
<EOS>
You
think
me
then
devoid
of
every
proper
feeling
,
I
be
sure
you
do
.
<EOS>
the
turn
of
your
countenance
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
,
as
you
say
that
I
could
not

would
induce
you

accept
me

do
not

what
I
then

these

not

I
assure

both
reason

Darcy

I

myself

the

begin
in
bitterness

it
do
not
end
so

<EOS>
the
adieu
be
charity
itself

think
no

<EOS>
the
feeling

so
widely
different

ought
to

<EOS>
You
must
learn
some
of
my
philosophy

<EOS>
think
only
of
the
past

its
remembrance
give
you
pleasure

I
can
not
give
you
credit

any
philosophy

_
<EOS>
Your

retrospection
must
be
so
totally
void
of
reproach
,
that
the
contentment
arise
from
them

be
not
of
philosophy

what
be
much
well
,
of
ignorance

with

it
be
not
so

<EOS>
painful
recollection
will
intrude

which
can
not

I
have

I
be
spoil

(
my

allow

to

for

You
teach

a
lesson

hard
indeed
at

most
advantageous

<EOS>
by
you

I
be
properly
humble

I
come
to
you
without

You

you

not

I
never

my

often
lead

wrong

how
you
must
have
hate
me
after

evening

at

my

"
  
<EOS>

I

You
blame

Your

could
not

My
conscience
tell
me
that
I
deserve
no
extraordinary
politeness

I
confess
that
I
do
not

more
_

"
  
<EOS>

My
object

Darcy

"
be
to
shew
you
,
by
every
civility
in
my
power

that
I
be
not
so
mean
as
to
resent
the
past
;

I
hope
to
obtain
your
forgiveness
,
to
lessen
your
ill
opinion
,
by
let
you
see
that
your
reproofs
have
be
attend
to
.
<EOS>
how
soon
any
other
wish
introduce
themselves
I
can
hardly
tell
,

I
believe
in
about
half
an
hour
after
I
have
see
you
.

<EOS>
He
then
tell
her
of
Georgiana
's
delight
in
her
acquaintance
,
and
of
her
disappointment
at
its
sudden
interruption
;
which
naturally
lead
to
the
cause
of
that
interruption
,
she
soon
learn
that
his
resolution
of
follow
her
from
Derbyshire
in
quest
of
her
sister
,
have
be
form
before
he
quit
the
inn
,
and
that
his
gravity
and
thoughtfulness
there
,
have
arise
from
no
other
struggle
than
what
such
a
purpose
must
comprehend
.
  
<EOS>
She
express
her
gratitude
again
,
but
it
be
too
painful
a
subject
to
each
,
to
be
dwell
on
farther
.
  
<EOS>
after
walk
several
mile
in
a
leisurely
manner
,
and
too
busy
to
know
any
thing
about
it
,
they
find
at
last
,
on
examine
their
watch
,
that
it
be
time
to
be
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
could
become
of
Mr.
Bingley

Jane

be
a
wonder

introduce
the
discussion
of

their
_
affair

Darcy
be
delighted
with
their
engagement

give
him
the
early
information

at
all

away

you
have
give
your
permission

as
much

though
he
exclaim
at
the
term
,
she
find
that
it
have
be
pretty
much
the
case

<EOS>
"
on
the
evening
before
my
go
to
London
,
"
say
he
<EOS>
"
I
make
a
confession
to
him
,
which
I
believe
I
ought
to
have
make
long
ago
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
of
all
that
have
occur
to
make
my
former
interference
in
his
affair
,
absurd
and
impertinent
.
<EOS>
His
surprise
be
great
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
have
the
slight
suspicion
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
moreover
,
that
I
believe
myself
mistaken
in
supposing
,
as
I
have
do
,
that
your
sister
be
indifferent
to
him
;
and
as
I
could
easily
perceive
that
his
attachment
to
her
be
unabated
,
I
feel
no
doubt
of
their
happiness
together

<EOS>
Elizabeth
could
not
help
smile
at
his
easy
manner
of
direct
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
speak
from
your
own
observation
,
"
say
she
,
"

you
tell
him
that
my
sister
love
him
,

merely
from
my
information
last
spring
?

"
<EOS>
from
the
former
.
<EOS>
I
have
narrowly
observe
her
during
the
two
visit
which
I
have
lately
make
her
here
;
and
I
be
convince
of
her
affection
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
your
assurance
of
it
<EOS>

I
suppose

immediate
conviction

him

It
do
.
<EOS>
Bingley
be
most
unaffectedly
modest

<EOS>
His
diffidence
have
prevent
his

on
his
own
judgment
in
so
anxious
a
case

but
his
reliance
on
mine
,
make
every
thing
easy
.
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
confess
one
thing
,
which
for
a
time
,
and
not
unjustly
,
offend
him
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
allow
myself
to
conceal
that
your
sister
have
be
in
town
three
month
last
winter
,
that
I
have
know
it
,
and
purposely
keep
it
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
angry
.
<EOS>
but
his
anger

I
be
persuade
,
last
no
longer
than
he
remain
in
any
doubt
of
your
sister

sentiment

He
have
heartily
forgive
me
now

"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
long
to
observe
that
Mr.
Bingley
have
be
a
most
delightful
friend
;
so
easily
guide
that
his
worth
be
invaluable
;
but
she
check
herself
.
<EOS>
She
remember
that
he
have
yet
to
learn
to
be
laught
at
,
and
it
be
rather
too
early
to
begin

in
anticipate
the
happiness
of
Bingley

of

be
to
be
inferior
only
to
his

reach
the
house

hall

My

Lizzy

a
question
which
Elizabeth

from
Jane

soon

she
enter
the
room
,

from
all
the
other
when
they
sit
down
to

have
only
to
say
in
reply
,
that
they
have
wander
about

she
be
beyond

She
colour
as

a
suspicion

evening
pass
quietly

besides
the
immediate
embarrassment

be
other
evil
before
her

She
anticipate
what
would
be

in
the
family

situation
become

be
aware
that
no

like
him

a

do
away

at
night

avoid

Mrs.
Bennet
,
as
she
stand
at
a
window
the
next
morning
,
"
if
that
disagreeable
Mr.
Darcy
be
not
come
here
again
with
our
dear
Bingley
!
<EOS>
what
can
he
mean
by
be
so
tiresome
as
to
be
always
come
here
?
<EOS>
I
have
no
notion
but
he
would
go
a
shooting
,
or
something
or
other
,
and
not
disturb
us
with
his
company
.
<EOS>
what
shall
we
do
with
him
?
<EOS>
Lizzy
,
you
must
walk
out
with
him
again
,
that
he
may
not
be
in
Bingley
's
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
Elizabeth
could
hardly
help
laugh
at
so
convenient
a
proposal
;
yet
be
really
vexed
that
her
mother
should
be
always
give
him
such
an
epithet
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
enter
,
Bingley
look
at
her
so
expressively
,
and
shake
hand
with
such
warmth
,
as
leave
no
doubt
of
his
good
information
;
and
he
soon
afterwards
say
aloud
,
"
Mr.
Bennet
,
have
you
no
more
lane
hereabouts
in
which
Lizzy
may
lose
her
way
again
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
advise
Mr.
Darcy
,
and
Lizzy
,
and
Kitty
,
"
say
Mrs.
Bennet
,
"
to
walk
to
Oakham
Mount
this
morning
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
nice
long
walk
,
and
Mr.
Darcy
have
never
see
the
view
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
do
very
well
for
the
other
,
"
reply
Mr.
Bingley
;
"
but
I
be
sure
it
will
be
too
much
for
Kitty
.
<EOS>
will
not
it
,
Kitty
?
"
  
<EOS>
Kitty
own
that
she
have
rather
stay
at
home
.
<EOS>
Darcy
profess
a
great
curiosity
to
see
the
view
from
the
Mount
,
and
Elizabeth
silently
consent
.
<EOS>
as
she
go
up
stair
to
get
ready
,
Mrs.
Bennet
follow
her
,
say
,
  
"
I
be
quite
sorry
,
Lizzy
,
that
you
should
be
force
to
have
that
disagreeable
man
all
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
but
I
hope
you
will
not
mind
it
<EOS>
:
it
be
all
for
Jane
's
sake
,
you
know
;
and
there
be
no
occasion
for
talk
to
him
,
except
just
now
and
then
.
<EOS>
so
,
do
not
put
yourself
to
inconvenience
.
"
  
<EOS>
during
their
walk
,
it
be
resolve
that
Mr.
Bennet
's
consent
should
be
ask
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
reserve
to
herself
the
application
for
her
mother
's
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
determine
how
her
mother
would
take
it
;
sometimes
doubt
whether
all
his
wealth
and
grandeur
would
be
enough
to
overcome
her
abhorrence
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
but
whether
she
be
violently
set
against
the
match
,
or
violently
delighted
with
it
,
it
be
certain
that
her
manner
would
be
equally
ill
adapt
to
do
credit
to
her
sense
;
and
she
could
no
more
bear
that
Mr.
Darcy
should
hear
the
first
rapture
of
her
joy
,
than
the
first
vehemence
of
her
disapprobation
.
     
<EOS>
in
the
evening
,
soon
after
Mr.
Bennet
withdraw
to
the
library
,
she
see
Mr.
Darcy
rise
also
and
follow
him
,
and
her
agitation
on
see
it
be
extreme
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
fear
her
father
's
opposition
,
but
he
be
go
to
be
make
unhappy
,
and
that
it
should
be
through
her
mean
,
that
_
she
_
,
his
favourite
child
,
should
be
distress
him
by
her
choice
,
should
be
fill
him
with
fear
and
regret
in
dispose
of
her
,
be
a
wretched
reflection
,
and
she
sit
in
misery
till
Mr.
Darcy
appear
again
,
when
,
look
at
him
,
she
be
a
little
relieved
by
his
smile
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
he
approach
the
table
where
she
be
sit
with
Kitty
;
and
,
while
pretend
to
admire
her
work
,
say
in
a
whisper
,
"
go
to
your
father
,
he
want
you
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
go
directly
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
be
walk
about
the
room
,
look
grave
and
anxious
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lizzy
,
"
say
he
,
"
what
be
you
do
?
<EOS>
be
you
out
of
your
sense
,
to
be
accept
this
man
?
<EOS>
have
not
you
always
hate
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
how
earnestly
do
she
then
wish
that
her
former
opinion
have
be
more
reasonable
,
her
expression
more
moderate
!
<EOS>
It
would
have
spare
her
from
explanation
and
profession
which
it
be
exceedingly
awkward
to
give
;
but
they
be
now
necessary
,
and
she
assure
him
with
some
confusion
,
of
her
attachment
to
Mr.
Darcy
.
  
<EOS>
"
or
in
other
word
,
you
be
determined
to
have
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
rich
,
to
be
sure
,
and
you
may
have
more
fine
clothe
and
fine
carriage
than
Jane
.
<EOS>
but
will
they
make
you
happy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
any
other
objection
,
"
say
Elizabeth
,
"
than
your
belief
of
my
indifference
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
none
at
all
.
<EOS>
We
all
know
him
to
be
a
proud
,
unpleasant
sort
of
man
;
but
this
would
be
nothing
if
you
really
like
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
I
do
like
him
,
"
she
reply
,
with
tear
in
her
eye
,
"
I
love
him
.
<EOS>
indeed
he
have
no
improper
pride
.
<EOS>
He
be
perfectly
amiable
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
what
he
really
be
;
then
pray
do
not
pain
me
by
speak
of
him
in
such
term
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lizzy
,
"
say
her
father
,
"
I
have
give
him
my
consent
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
kind
of
man
,
indeed
,
to
whom
I
should
never
dare
refuse
any
thing
,
which
he
condescend
to
ask
.
<EOS>
I
now
give
it
to
_
<EOS>
you
_
,
if
you
be
resolve
on
have
him
.
<EOS>
but
let
me
advise
you
to
think
better
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
your
disposition
,
Lizzy
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
you
could
be
neither
happy
nor
respectable
,
unless
you
truly
esteem
your
husband
;
unless
you
look
up
to
him
as
a
superior
.
<EOS>
Your
lively
talent
would
place
you
in
the
great
danger
in
an
unequal
marriage
.
<EOS>
You
could
scarcely
escape
discredit
and
misery
.
<EOS>
My
child
,
let
me
not
have
the
grief
of
see
_
you
_
unable
to
respect
your
partner
in
life
.
<EOS>
You
know
not
what
you
be
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
,
still
more
affected
,
be
earnest
and
solemn
in
her
reply
;
and
at
length
,
by
repeat
assurance
that
Mr.
Darcy
be
really
the
object
of
her
choice
,
by
explain
the
gradual
change
which
her
estimation
of
him
have
undergo
,
relate
her
absolute
certainty
that
his
affection
be
not
the
work
of
a
day
,
but
have
stand
the
test
of
many
month
suspense
,
and
enumerate
with
energy
all
his
good
quality
,
she
do
conquer
her
father
's
incredulity
,
and
reconcile
him
to
the
match
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
dear
,
"
say
he
,
when
she
cease
speak
,
"
I
have
no
more
to
say
.
<EOS>
if
this
be
the
case
,
he
deserve
you
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
part
with
you
,
my
Lizzy
,
to
any
one
less
worthy
.
"
  
<EOS>
to
complete
the
favourable
impression
,
she
then
tell
him
what
Mr.
Darcy
have
voluntarily
do
for
Lydia
.
<EOS>
He
hear
her
with
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
an
evening
of
wonder
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
and
so
,
Darcy
do
every
thing
;
make
up
the
match
,
give
the
money
,
pay
the
fellow
's
debt
,
and
get
him
his
commission
!
<EOS>
so
much
the
well
.
<EOS>
It
will
save
me
a
world
of
trouble
and
economy
.
<EOS>
have
it
be
your
uncle
's
do
<EOS>
,
I
must
and
_
would
_
have
pay
him
;
but
these
violent
young
lover
carry
every
thing
their
own
way
.
<EOS>
I
shall
offer
to
pay
him
to
-
morrow
;
he
will
rant
and
storm
about
his
love
for
you
,
and
there
will
be
an
end
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
then
recollect
her
embarrassment
a
few
day
before
,
on
his
reading
Mr.
Collins
's
letter
;
and
after
laugh
at
her
some
time
,
allow
her
at
last
to
go
 
saying
,
as
she
quit
the
room
,
"
if
any
young
man
come
for
Mary
or
Kitty
,
send
them
in
,
for
I
be
quite
at
leisure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
's
mind
be
now
relieve
from
a
very
heavy
weight
;
and
,
after
half
an
hour
's
quiet
reflection
in
her
own
room
,
she
be
able
to
join
the
other
with
tolerable
composure
.
<EOS>
every
thing
be
too
recent
for
gaiety
,
but
the
evening
pass
tranquilly
away
;
there
be
no
longer
any
thing
material
to
be
dread
,
and
the
comfort
of
ease
and
familiarity
would
come
in
time
.
  
<EOS>
when
her
mother
go
up
to
her
dressing
-
room
at
night
,
she
follow
her
,
and
make
the
important
communication
.
<EOS>
Its
effect
be
most
extraordinary
;
for
on
first
hearing
it
,
Mrs.
Bennet
sit
quite
still
,
and
unable
to
utter
a
syllable
.
<EOS>
nor
be
it
under
many
,
many
minute
,
that
she
could
comprehend
what
she
hear
;
though
not
in
general
backward
to
credit
what
be
for
the
advantage
of
her
family
,
or
that
come
in
the
shape
of
a
lover
to
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
She
begin
at
length
to
recover
,
to
fidget
about
in
her
chair
,
get
up
,
sit
down
again
,
wonder
,
and
bless
herself
.

<EOS>
this
be
enough
to
prove
that

rejoice
that

before

particularly
fond
of

that
I
may
have

to

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
sad
oman
of
what
her
mother
's
behaviour
to
the
gentleman
himself
may
be
;
and
Elizabeth
find
,
that
though
in
the
certain
possession
of
his
warm
affection
,
and
secure
of
her
relation
'
consent
,
there
be
still
something
to
be
wish
for

<EOS>
but
the
morrow
pass
off
much
better
than
she
expect
;
for
Mrs.
Bennet
luckily
stand
in
such
awe
of
her
intend
son
-
in
-
law
,
that
she
venture
not
to
speak
to
him
,
unless
it
be
in
her
power
to
offer
him
any
attention
,
or
mark
her
deference
for
his
opinion

<EOS>
Elizabeth
have
the
satisfaction
of
see
her
father
take
pain
to
get
acquaint
with
him
;
and
Mr.

soon
assure
her
that

every

"
I
admire

she

You
may

impertinence

very
little
less

the
fact

that

when

do

look

congratulation

all

affectionate

insincere

She
write
even
to

the
occasion

to
express

delight

repeat
all
her
former
profession

regard

affect

though
feel
no
reliance

could
not

sincere

side

contain
all

love

<EOS>
before
any
answer
could
arrive
from
Mr.
Collins
,

any
congratulation
to
Elizabeth
,
from
his
wife
,
the
Longbourn
family
hear
that
the
Collinses
be
come
themselves
to
Lucas
lodge

the
reason
of
this
sudden
removal
be
soon
evident

Lady
Catherine
have
be
render
so
exceedingly
angry

the
content
of

letter

that
Charlotte

really
rejoice

away

over

<EOS>
at
such
a
moment

the
arrival
of
her
friend
be
a
sincere
pleasure
to
Elizabeth

though
in
the
course

she
must
sometimes
think
the
pleasure
dearly
buy
,
when
she
see
Mr.

expose
to
all
the
parading
and
obsequious
civility
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
He
bear
it
however
with
admirable
calmness
.
<EOS>
He
could
even
listen
to
Sir
William
Lucas
,
when
he
compliment
him
on
carry
away
the
bright
jewel
of
the
country
,
and
express
his
hope
of
their
all
meeting
frequently
at
St.
James
's

with
very
decent
composure

<EOS>
if
he
do
shrug
his
shoulder
,
it
be
not
till
Sir
William
be
out
of
sight
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Philips
's
vulgarity
be
another
,
and
perhaps
a
great
tax
on
his
forbearance
;
and
though
Mrs.
Philips
,
as
well
as
her
sister
,
stand
in
too
much
awe
of
him
to
speak
with
the
familiarity
which
Bingley
's
good
humour
encourage
,
yet
,
whenever
she
_
do
_
speak
,
she
must
be
vulgar
.
<EOS>
nor
be
her
respect
for
him
,
though
it
make
her
more
quiet
,
at
all
likely
to
make
her
more
elegant
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
do
all
she
could
,
to
shield
him
from
the
frequent
notice
of
either
,
and
be
ever
anxious
to
keep
him
to
herself
,
and
to
those
of
her
family
with
whom
he
may
converse
without
mortification
;
and
though
the
uncomfortable
feeling
arise
from
all
this
take
from
the
season
of
courtship
much
of
its
pleasure
,
it
add
to
the
hope
of
the
future
;
and
she
look
forward
with
delight
to
the
time
when
they
should
be
remove
from
society
so
little
pleasing
to
either
,
to
all
the
comfort
and
elegance
of
their
family
party

<EOS>
Happy
for
all
her
maternal
feeling

be
the
day
on
which
Mrs.
Bennet
get
rid
of

two
most
deserve
daughter
.
<EOS>
with
what
delighted
pride
she
afterwards
visit
Mrs.
Bingley
and
talk
of
Mrs.
Darcy
may
be
guess
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
say
,
for
the
sake
of
her
family
,
that
the
accomplishment
of
her
earnest
desire
in
the
establishment
of
so
many
of
her
child
,
produce
so
happy
an
effect
as
to
make
her
a
sensible
,
amiable
,
well
-
inform
woman
for
the
rest
of
her
life
;
though
perhaps
it
be
lucky
for
her
husband
,
who
may
not
have
relish
domestic
felicity
in
so
unusual
a
form
,
that
she
still
be
occasionally
nervous
and
invariably
silly
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bennet
miss
his
second
daughter
exceedingly
;
his
affection
for
her
draw
him
oftener
from
home
than
any
thing
else
could
do
.
<EOS>
He
delight
in
go
to
Pemberley
,
especially
when
he
be
least
expect
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bingley
and
Jane
remain
at
Netherfield
only
a
twelvemonth
.
<EOS>
so
near
a
vicinity
to
her
mother
and
Meryton
relation
be
not
desirable
even
to
_
his
_
easy
temper
,
or
_
her
_
affectionate
heart
.
<EOS>
the
darle
wish
of
his
sister
be
then
gratify
;
he
buy
an
estate
in
a
neighbour
county
to
Derbyshire
,
and
Jane
and
Elizabeth
,
in
addition
to
every
other
source
of
happiness
,
be
within
thirty
mile
of
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
Kitty
,
to
her
very
material
advantage
,
spend
the
chief
of
her
time
with
her
two
elder
sister
.
<EOS>
in
society
so
superior
to
what
she
have
generally
know
,
her
improvement
be
great
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
of
so
ungovernable
a
temper
as
Lydia
,
and
,
remove
from
the
influence
of
Lydia
's
example
,
she
become
,
by
proper
attention
and
management
,
less
irritable
,
less
ignorant
,
and
less
insipid
.
<EOS>
from
the
farth
disadvantage
of
Lydia
's
society
she
be
of
course
carefully
keep
,
and
though
Mrs.
Wickham
frequently
invite
her
to
come
and
stay
with
her
,
with
the
promise
of
ball
and
young
man
,
her
father
would
never
consent
to
her
going
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
be
the
only
daughter
who
remain
at
home
;
and
she
be
necessarily
draw
from
the
pursuit
of
accomplishment
by
Mrs.
Bennet
's
be
quite
unable
to
sit
alone
.
<EOS>
Mary
be
oblige
to
mix
more
with
the
world
,
but
she
could
still
moralize
over
every
morning
visit
;
and
as
she
be
no
longer
mortify
by
comparison
between
her
sister
'
beauty
and
her
own
,
it
be
suspect
by
her
father
that
she
submit
to
the
change
without
much
reluctance
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Wickham
and
Lydia
,
their
character
suffer
no
revolution
from
the
marriage
of
her
sister
.
<EOS>
He
bear
with
philosophy
the
conviction
that
Elizabeth
must
now
become
acquainted
with
whatever
of
his
ingratitude
and
falsehood
have
before
be
unknown
to
her
;
and
in
spite
of
every
thing
,
be
not
wholly
without
hope
that
Darcy
may
yet
be
prevail
on
to
make
his
fortune
.
<EOS>
the
congratulatory
letter
which
Elizabeth
receive
from
Lydia
on
her
marriage
,
explain
to
her
that
,
by
his
wife
at
least
,
if
not
by
himself
,
such
a
hope
be
cherish
.
<EOS>
the
letter
be
to
this
effect
:
  
"
my
dear
LIZZY

I
wish
you
joy
.
<EOS>
if
you
love
Mr.
Darcy
half
as
well
as
I
do
my
dear
Wickham
,
you
must
be
very
happy
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
comfort
to
have
you
so
rich
,
and
when
you
have
nothing
else
to
do
,
I
hope
you
will
think
of
us
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
Wickham
would
like
a
place
at
court
very
much
,
and
I
do
not
think
we
shall
have
quite
money
enough
to
live
upon
without
some
help
.
<EOS>
any
place
would
do
,
of
about
three
or
four
hundred
a
year
;
but
,
however
,
do
not
speak
to
Mr.
Darcy
about
it
,
if
you
have
rather
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yours
,
&
c.
"
  
as
it
happen
that
Elizabeth
have
_
much
_
rather
not
,
she
endeavour
in
her
answer
to
put
an
end
to
every
intreaty
and
expectation
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
such
relief
,
however
,
as
it
be
in
her
power
to
afford
,
by
the
practice
of
what
may
be
call
economy
in
her
own
private
expence
,
she
frequently
send
them
.
<EOS>
It
have
always
be
evident
to
her
that
such
an
income
as
theirs
,
under
the
direction
of
two
person
so
extravagant
in
their
want
,
and
heedless
of
the
future
,
must
be
very
insufficient
to
their
support
;
and
whenever
they
change
their
quarter
,
either
Jane
or
herself
be
sure
of
be
apply
to
,
for
some
little
assistance
towards
discharge
their
bill
.
<EOS>
Their
manner
of
living
,
even
when
the
restoration
of
peace
dismiss
them
to
a
home
,
be
unsettle
in
the
extreme
.
<EOS>
They
be
always
move
from
place
to
place
in
quest
of
a
cheap
situation
,
and
always
spend
more
than
they
ought
.
<EOS>
His
affection
for
her
soon
sink
into
indifference
;
her
's
last
a
little
longer
;
and
in
spite
of
her
youth
and
her
manner
,
she
retain
all
the
claim
to
reputation
which
her
marriage
have
give

though
Darcy
could

and
with
the
Bingleys

of
them
frequently
staid
so
long
,
that
even
Bingley
's
good
humour

overcome
,
and
he
proceed
so
far
as
to
_
talk
<EOS>
_
of

them
a
hint
to

<EOS>
Miss
Bingley
be
very
deeply
mortify
by
Darcy
's
marriage
;
but
as
she
think
it
advisable
to
retain
the
right
of
visit
at
Pemberley
,
she
dropt
all
her
resentment
;
be
fond
than
ever
of
Georgiana
,
almost
as
attentive
to
Darcy
as
heretofore
,
and
pay
off
every
arrear
of
civility
to
Elizabeth
.
  
<EOS>
Pemberley

now
Georgiana

home
;
and
the
attachment
of
the
sister

exactly
what
Darcy
have
hope
to
see

They
be
able
to
love
each
other
,
even
as
well
as
they
intend

the
high
opinion
in
the
world
of
Elizabeth

though
at
first

often
listen
with
an
astonishment
border
on
alarm
,
at
her
lively
,
sportive
,
manner
of
talk
to
her
brother
.

in
herself
a
respect
which

the
object
of
open
pleasantry
.
<EOS>
Her
mind
receive
knowledge
which
have
never
before
fall
in
her
way
.
<EOS>
by
Elizabeth
's
instruction
she
begin
to
comprehend
that
a
woman
may
take
liberty
with
her
husband
,
which
a
brother
will
not
always
allow
in
a
sister
more
than
ten
year
young
than
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Catherine

extremely
indignant

the
marriage
of
her
nephew

the
genuine
frankness
of
her
character
,
in
her
reply
to
the
letter
which

its
arrangement

she
send
him
language
so
very
abusive
,
especially
of
Elizabeth
,
that
for
some
time
all
intercourse

at
an
end

but
at
length
,
by
Elizabeth
's
persuasion
,
he
be
prevail
on
to
overlook
the
offence
,
and
seek
a
reconciliation
;
and
,
after
a
little
farth
resistance
on
the
part
of
his
aunt
,
her
resentment
give
way
,
either
to
her
affection
for
him
,
or
her
curiosity
to
see
how
his
wife
conduct
herself
;
and
she
condescend
to
wait
on
them
at
Pemberley
,
in
spite
of
that
pollution
which
its
wood
have
receive
,
not
merely
from
the
presence
of
such
a
mistress
,
but
the
visit
of
her
uncle
and
aunt
from
the
city
.
  
<EOS>
with
the
Gardiners

they
be
always
on
the
most
intimate
term

as
well
as

and
