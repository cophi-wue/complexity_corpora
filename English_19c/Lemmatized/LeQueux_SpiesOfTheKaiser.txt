if
ENGLAND
KNEW
  
no
sane
person
can
deny
that
England
be
in
grave
danger
of
invasion
by
Germany
at
a
date
not
far
distant
.
 
<EOS>
this
very
serious
fact
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
place
vividly
before
the
public
in
my
recent
forecast
,
_
<EOS>
the
Invasion
of
1910
<EOS>
_
,
the
publication
of
which
,
in
Germany
and
in
England
,
arouse
a
storm
of
indignation
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
Government
,
it
will
be
remember
,
endeavour
to
suppress
its
publication
,
because
it
contain
many
serious
truth
,
which
it
be
deem
good
should
be
withhold
from
the
public
,
and
on
its
publication
--
in
defiance
of
the
statement
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
<EOS>
the
pressure
bring
upon
me
by
the
Prime
Minister
--
I
be
denounce
as
a
panicmonger
.
 
<EOS>
but
have
not
certain
of
my
warning
already
be
fulfil
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
desire
to
create
undue
alarm
.
<EOS>
I
be
an
Englishman
,
and
,
I
hope
,
a
patriot
.
<EOS>
what
I
have
write
in
this
present
volume
in
the
form
of
fiction
be
base
upon
serious
fact
within
my
own
personal
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
that
german
spy
be
actively
at
work
in
Great
Britain
be
well
known
to
the
authority
.
<EOS>
the
number
of
agent
of
the
german
Secret
Police
at
this
moment
work
in
our
midst
on
behalf
of
the
Intelligence
Department
in
Berlin
be
believe
to
be
over
five
thousand
.
<EOS>
to
each
agent
--
know
as
a
"
fix
-
post"--is
allot
the
task
of
discover
some
secret
,
or
of
note
in
a
certain
district
every
detail
which
may
be
of
advantage
to
the
invader
when
he
land
.
<EOS>
this
"
fix
-
agent
"
be
,
in
turn
,
control
by
a
travel
agent
,
who
visit
him
regularly
,
allot
the
work
,
collect
his
report
,
and
make
monthly
payment
,
the
usual
stipend
varying
from
L10
to
L30
per
month
,
accord
to
the
social
position
of
the
spy
and
the
work
in
which
he
or
she
may
be
engage
.
 
<EOS>
the
spy
themselves
be
not
always
german
.
<EOS>
They
be
often
Belgians
,
Swiss
,
or
Frenchmen
employ
in
various
trade
and
profession
,
and
each
be
know
in
the
Bureau
of
Secret
Police
by
a
number
only
,
their
monthly
information
be
docket
under
that
particular
number
.
<EOS>
every
six
month
an
"
inspection
"
be
hold
,
and
monetary
reward
make
to
those
whose
success
have
be
most
noteworthy
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
brigade
of
spy
in
England
be
control
by
a
well
-
know
member
of
the
german
Secret
Police
in
London
,
from
whom
the
travel
agent
take
their
order
,
and
in
turn
transmit
them
to
the
"
fix
-
post
,
"
who
be
scatter
up
and
down
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
write
,
I
have
before
me
a
file
of
amazing
document
,
which
plainly
show
the
feverish
activity
with
which
this
advance
guard
of
our
enemy
be
work
to
secure
for
their
employer
the
most
detailed
information
.
<EOS>
these
document
have
already
be
place
before
the
Minister
for
War
,
who
return
them
without
comment
!
 
<EOS>
He
be
aware
of
the
truth
,
and
can
not
deny
it
in
face
of
these
incriminate
statement
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
often
say
that
the
Germans
do
not
require
to
pursue
any
system
of
espionage
in
England
when
they
can
purchase
our
ordnance
map
at
a
shill
each
.
<EOS>
but
do
these
ordnance
map
show
the
number
of
horse
and
cart
in
a
district
,
the
store
of
food
and
forage
,
the
good
way
in
which
to
destroy
bridge
,
the
line
of
telegraph
and
telephone
,
and
the
place
with
which
they
communicate
,
and
such
-
like
matter
of
vital
importance
to
the
invader
?
<EOS>
fact
such
as
these
,
and
many
other
,
be
be
daily
convey
by
spy
in
their
carefully
prepare
report
to
Berlin
,
as
well
as
the
secret
of
every
detail
of
our
armament
,
our
defence
,
and
our
new
invention
.
 
<EOS>
during
the
last
twelve
month
,
aid
by
a
well
-
know
detective
officer
,
I
have
make
personal
inquiry
into
the
presence
and
work
of
these
spy
,
an
inquiry
which
have
entail
a
great
amount
of
travelling
,
much
watchfulness
,
and
often
considerable
discomfort
,
for
I
have
feel
that
,
in
the
circumstance
,
some
system
of
contra
-
espionage
should
be
establish
,
as
have
be
do
in
France
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
refrain
from
give
actual
name
and
date
,
for
obvious
reason
,
and
have
therefore
be
compel
,
even
at
risk
of
be
again
denounce
as
a
scaremonger
,
to
present
the
fact
in
the
form
of
fiction
--
fiction
which
,
I
trust
,
will
point
its
own
patriotic
moral
.
 
<EOS>
Colonel
Mark
Lockwood
,
Member
for
Epping
,
sound
a
very
serious
warning
note
in
the
middle
of
1908
when
he
ask
question
of
the
Minister
for
War
,
and
afterwards
of
the
Prime
Minister
,
respect
the
presence
of
german
spy
in
Norfolk
,
Suffolk
,
Essex
,
and
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
He
point
out
that
for
the
past
two
year
these
individual
,
work
upon
a
carefully
prepared
plan
,
have
be
sketch
,
photograph
,
and
carefully
make
note
throughout
the
whole
of
East
Anglia
.
 
<EOS>
with
truth
,
he
declare
that
this
organise
system
of
espionage
be
for
one
reason
alone
,
namely
in
preparation
for
a
sudden
raid
upon
our
shore
,
for
"
the
Day"--as
<EOS>
it
be
know
in
Germany
--
the
day
of
the
Invasion
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
the
reply
give
by
His
Majesty
's
Ministers
be
colourless
,
though
they
both
actually
confess
themselves
unable
to
deal
with
the
situation
!
<EOS>
under
our
exist
law
it
seem
that
a
foreign
spy
be
free
to
go
hither
and
thither
,
and
plot
the
downfall
of
England
,
while
we
,
ostrich
-
like
,
bury
our
head
in
the
sand
at
the
sign
of
approach
danger
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
have
pass
when
one
Englishman
be
worth
ten
foreigner
.
<EOS>
modern
science
in
warfare
have
alter
all
that
.
<EOS>
all
the
rifle
-
club
in
England
could
not
stop
one
german
battalion
,
because
the
german
battalion
be
train
and
discipline
in
the
art
of
war
,
while
our
rifle
-
club
be
neither
discipline
nor
train
.
<EOS>
be
every
able
-
bodied
man
in
the
kingdom
to
join
a
rifle
-
club
<EOS>
we
should
be
no
nearer
the
problem
of
beat
the
german
invader
if
once
they
land
,
than
if
the
spectator
in
all
the
football
match
hold
in
Britain
mobilise
against
a
foreign
foe
.
<EOS>
the
territorial
idea
be
a
delusion
.
<EOS>
seaside
camp

a

not

<EOS>
the
art
of
navigation
,
the

of

,
or
the
trade
of

can
not

--
neither
can

<EOS>
in
response
,
we
have

up
to
us
the
strength
of
our
Navy

<EOS>
but
be
it

no

<EOS>
many
of
these
statement
<EOS>
Ray
and
I
have
,
during
the
past
two
month
,
closely
investigate
on
the
spot
,
and
what
we
have
discover
hold
us
both
amazed
and
alarm
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
we
have
secure
evidence
that
although
spy
be
openly
at
work
in
certain
of
our
eastern
county
collect
all
sort
of
information
which
would
be
of
incalculable
importance
to
an
invader
,
yet
the
chief
constable
of
those
county
have
actually
be
instruct
from
head
-
quarter
to
close
their
eye
to
the
movement
of
inquisitive
foreigner
!
 
<EOS>
in
the
investigation
upon
which
Ray

have
embark
with
such
enthusiasm
,
and
which
I
be
now
permit

he
have
take
only
two

myself

the

the

to

<EOS>
indeed
,
from
the
first
I
suspect
that
it
have
be
her
influence
that
have
rouse
him
to
action
;
she
who
have
promise
him
her
assistance
,
and
who
have
point
out
how
,
by
watch
and
unmask
the
spy
,
he
may
render
his
King

<EOS>
at
dusk
that
day
we

so
step
to
the
comfortable
Hawes

at

have
dine
there

<EOS>
thence
we
have
take
the

over
to
North
Queensferry

on
the
opposite

,
where
,
in
the
rather
bare
parlour
of

directly
beneath
the
giant

we

<EOS>
outside
the
November

<EOS>
from
my
boyhood
day
,
I
,
John
James
Jacox
,
barrister
-
at
-
law
,
have
always
be
fond
of
detective
work
;
therefore
I
realise
that
in
the
present
inquiry
before
us
there
be
wide
scope
for
one
's
reasoning
power
,
as
well
as
a
great
probability
of
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
thoroughly
wipe
my
gold
pince
-
nez
,
utterly
fail
to
discover
Ray
's
reason
in
travel
to
that
spot
now
that
it
be
admit
that
the
Germans
have
already
outwit
us
and
secure
a
copy
of
at
least
one
of
the
plan
.
<EOS>
suddenly
,
glance
up
at
the
cheap
american
clock
on
the
mantelshelf
,
my
friend
declare
that
we
ought
to
be
move
and
at
once
struggle
into
his
coat
and
crush
on
his
soft
felt
hat
.
<EOS>
It
then
want
a
quarter
to
ten
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
in
ascend
the
short
,
steep
hill
in
the
semi
-
darkness
,
we
pass
the
North
Queensferry
post
office
,
beside
which
he
stop
short
to
peer
down
the
dark
alley
which
separate
it
from
the
Roxburgh
Hotel
.
<EOS>
I
notice
that
in
this
alley
stand
a
short
,
stout
telegraph
-
pole
,
carry
about
sixty
or
so
line
of
wire
which
,
come
overhead
from
the
north
,
converge
at
that
point
into
a
cable
,
and
cross
to
the
south
beneath
the
mile
-
broad
water
of
the
Forth
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
be
apparently
interested
in
them
,
for
glance
overhead
he
see
another
set
of
wire
which
,
carry
higher
,
cross
the
street
and
run
away
to
the
left
.
<EOS>
this
road
he
follow
,
I
walk
at
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
the
way
we
take
prove
to
be
a
wind
one
,
which
,
instead
of
ascend
the
steep
hill
with
its
many
quarry
,
from
the
summit
of
which
the
wonderful
bridge
run
forth
,
skirt
the
estuary
westward
past
a
number
of
small
grey
cottage
,
the
garden
of
some
of
which
appear
to
run
down
to
the
broad
water
<EOS>
whence
shine
the
flashing
light
of
the
Beamer
and
those
of
Dalmeny
,
the
Bridge
,
and
of
South
Queensferry
.
 
<EOS>
the
rain
have
cease
,
and
the
moon
,
slowly
struggle
from
behind
a
big
bank
of
cloud
,
now
produce
a
most
picturesque
effect
of
light
and
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
the
action
of
Ray
Raymond
be
,
however
,
somewhat
mysterious
,
for
on
pass
each
telegraph
-
pole
he
,
by
the
aid
of
a
small
electric
torch
he
carry
in
his
pocket
,
examine
it
carefully
at
a
distance
of
about
six
foot
from
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
have
thus
minutely
examine
at
least
fifteen
or
sixteen
when
,
at
the
sharp
bend
of
the
road
,
he
apparently
discover
something
of
which
he
be
in
search
.
<EOS>
the
pole
stand
close
beside
the
narrow
pathway
,
and
as
he
examine
it
with
his
magnifying
-
glass
<EOS>
I
also
become
curious
.
<EOS>
but
all
I
distinguish
be
three
small
gimlet
hole
set
in
a
triangle
in
the
black
tar
wood
about
four
inch
apart
.
 
<EOS>
"
count
the
wire
,
Jack
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
make
them
twenty
-
six
.
<EOS>
be
I
correct
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
count
,
and
find
the
number
to
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
then
for
some
moment
he
stand
in
thoughtful
silence
,
gaze
away
over
the
wide
view
of
St.
Margaret
's
Hope
spread
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
afterwards
we
move
forward
.
<EOS>
pass
along
,
he
examine
each
of
the
other
pole
,
until
we
descend
the
hill
to
the
Ferry
Toll
,
where
the
high
road
and
wire
branch
off
to
the
right
to
Dunfermline
.
<EOS>
then
,
take
the
left
-
hand
road
along
the
shore
,
where
run
a
line
of
telephone
,
we
pass
some
wharf
,
gain
the
Limpet
Ness
,
and
for
a
further
couple
of
mile
skirt
the
moonlit
water
,
until
,
of
a
sudden
<EOS>
,
there
come
into
view
a
long
corrugate
-
iron
building
lie
back
from
the
road
face
the
Forth
and
fence
off
by
a
high
spike
-
iron
railing
.
<EOS>
the
entrance
be
in
the
centre
,
with
nine
long
window
on
either
side
,
while
at
a
little
distance
further
back
lie
a
small
bungalow
,
evidently
the
residence
of
the
caretaker
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
,
"
exclaim
my
friend
without
halt
,
"
be
the
much
-
discuss
Rosyth

<EOS>
these

the
Admiralty
office
,

from
here
the
tracing
of
that
plan
be
obtain
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
rather
lonely
spot
,
<EOS>
"
I
remark
.
 
<EOS>
"
over
yonder
,
beyond
that
ruin
castle
out
on
the
rock
,
where
Oliver
Cromwell
's
mother

<EOS>
You
will
get

well
view
from
the

side
of

"
he
say
in
a
low
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
live
in
the
bungalow
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
"
only
the
caretaker
.
<EOS>
the
near
house
be
on
top
of
the
hill
,
and
be
occupy
by
the
second
officer
in
charge
of
the
work
.
"
 
<EOS>
continue
our
way
and
pass
over
the
hill
,
we
skirt
a
wood
,
which
I
afterwards
find
to
be
Orchardhead
Wood
,
pass
a
pair
of
lonely
cottage
on
the
right
,
until
we
reach
a
lane
run
down
to
the
water
's
edge
.
<EOS>
turn
into
this
lane
,
we
walk
as
far
as
a
gate
which
command
the
great
stretch
of
broad
,
level
meadow
and
the
wide
bay
beyond
.
<EOS>
lean
over
it
,
he
say
:
 
"
this
be
where
the
new
naval
base
be
to
be
.
<EOS>
Yonder
,
where
you
see
the
light
,
be
Bruce
Haven
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
tell
me
the
fact
regard
the
steal
plan
as
far
as
be
know
,
"
I
say
,
lean
on
the
gate
also
and
gaze
away
across
the
wide
stretch
of
moonlit
water
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
fact
be
curious
,
"
reply
my
friend
.
<EOS>
"
as
you
know
,
I
have
be
away
from
London
a
fortnight
,
and
in
those
fourteen
day
I
have
not
be
idle
.
<EOS>
It
seem
that
when
the
first
plan
leak
out
and
be
publish
abroad
,
the
Admiralty
have
two
other
prepare
,
and
into
both
these
a
commission
which
come
down
here
have
,
for
several
month
,
be
busily
at
work
investigate
their
feasibility
.
<EOS>
at
last
one
of
the
scheme
have
be
adopt
.
<EOS>
tracing
of
it
be
keep
in
strict
secrecy
in
a
safe
in
the
office
down
yonder
,
together
with
large
-
scale
tracing
of
the
various
dock
,
the
submarine
station
,
repair
dock
,
patent
slip
,
and
defensive
fort
--
some
twenty
-
two
document
in
all
.
<EOS>
the
detail
of
the
defensive
fort
be
,
of
course
,
keep
a
profound
secret
.
<EOS>
the
safe
have
two
key
,
one
keep
by
the
superintendent
of
the
work
,
Mr.
Wilkinson
,
who
live
over
at
Dunfermline
,
and
the
other
by
the
first
officer
,
Mr.
Farrar
,
who
reside
in
a
house
half
a
mile
from
the
office
.
<EOS>
the
safe
can
not
be
open
except
by
the
two
gentleman
be
present
together
.
<EOS>
the
leakage
could
not
come
from
within
.
<EOS>
none
of
the
plan
have
ever
be
find
to
be
miss
and
no
suspicion
attach
to
anybody
,
yet
there
be
two
most
curious
fact
.
<EOS>
the
first
be
that
in
July
last
a
young
clerk
name
Edwin
Jephson
,
live
with
his
mother
in
Netley
Road
,
Shepherd
's
Bush
,
and
employ
by
a
firm
of
auctioneer
in
the
City
,
be
pick
up
in
the
Thames
off
Thorneycroft
's
at
Chiswick
.
<EOS>
at
the
inquest
,
the
girl
to
whom
the
young
man
be
engage
testify
to
his
strangeness
of
manner
a
few
day
previously
;
while
his
mother
state
how
,
prior
to
his
disappearance
,
he
have
be
absent
from
home
for
four
day
,
and
on
his
return
have
seem
greatly
perturb
,
and
have
remark
:
'
there
will
be
something
in
the
paper
about
me
before
long
.
'
<EOS>
on
the
body
be
find
fourteen
shilling
in
silver
,
some
copper
,
a
few
letter
,
and
a
folio
of
blue
foolscap
contain
some
writing
in
german
which
,
on
translation
,
prove
to
be
certain
detail
regard
a
fortress
.
<EOS>
a
verdict
of
suicide
be
return
;
but
the
statement
in
German
,
place
by
the
police
before
the
Admiralty
,
prove
to
be
an
exact
copy
of
one
of
the
document
preserve
in
the
safe
here
,
at
Rosyth
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
the
Admiralty
can
not
deny
the
leakage
of
the
secret
?
<EOS>
"
I
remark
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
;
but
the
mystery
remain
how
it
come
into
the
young
fellow
's
possession
,
and
what
he
be
about
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
can
be
ascertain
,
he
be
a
most
exemplary
young
man
,
and
have
no
connection
whatever
with
any
one
in
Admiralty
employ
,
"
reply
Ray
;
add
,
"
the
second
fact
be
the
one
allege
by
Reitmeyer
,
who
be
,
in
confidence
,
show
a
photograph
of
one
of
the
large
plan
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
spy
be
,
no
doubt
,
at
work
here
,
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
can
not
be
deny
,
"
be
his
reply
.
<EOS>
"
this
neighbourhood
open
up
a
wide
field
of
investigation
to
the
inquisitive
gentry
from
the
Fatherland
.
<EOS>
knowledge
of
the
secret
of
the
defence
of
the
Firth
of
Forth
would
be
of
the
utmost
advantage
to
Germany
in
the
event
of
an
invasion
.
<EOS>
the
local
submarine
defence
and
corp
of
submarine
miner
have
be
do
away
with
,
yet
the
entrance
of
the
estuary
be
command
by
strong
battery
upon
the
island
of
Inchkeith
,
opposite
Leith
;
the
Forth
Bridge
be
defend
by
masked
battery
at
Dalmeny
at
the
one
end
and
at
Carlingnose
at
the
other
,
while
upon
Inchgarvie
,
the
rock
beneath
the
centre
of
the
bridge
,
be
a
powerful
battery
of
six
-
inch
gun
.
<EOS>
the
true
strength
of
these
defence
,
and
the
existence
of
other
,
be
,
of
course
,
keep
an
absolute
secret
,
but
Germany
be
equally
anxious
to
learn
them
,
as
she
be
to
know
exactly
what
our
plan
be
regard
this
new
naval
base
and
its
fortification
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
if
the
new
base
be
establish
,
may
not
the
Forth
Bridge
be
blow
into
the
water
by
the
enemy
,
and
our
fleet
bottle
up
by
the
wreckage
?
<EOS>
"
I
venture
to
remark
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
just
the
point
,
Jack
,
"
my
friend
say
;
"
whether
the
rosyth
work
be
carry
out
or
not
,
the
Germans
would
,
without
doubt
,
use
their
good
endeavour
to
blow
up
the
bridge
;
first
in
order
to
cut
direct
communication
between
north
and
south
,
and
secondly
,
to
prevent
british
ship
use
St.
Margaret
's
Hope
as
a
haven
of
refuge
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
even
in
face
of
the
document
discover
upon
the
auctioneer
's
clerk
,
the
Government
deny
the
activity
of
spy
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
Ray
in
a
hard
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
week
ago
I
be
up
here
,
and
examine
the
safe
in
the
office
we
have
pass
.
<EOS>
I
be
only
laugh
at
for
my
pain
.
<EOS>
I
must
admit
,
of
course
,
that
no
document
have
ever
be
miss
,
and
that
the
safe
have
not
be
tamper
with
in
any
way

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
complete
mystery

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
one
which
,
my
dear
Jack
,
we
must
solve
,
"
he
say
,
as
we
retrace
our
step
back
to
North
Queensferry
station
,
where
we
luckily
catch
a
train
back
to
Edinburgh
.
 
<EOS>
next
morning
we
travel
again
to
Dalmeny
,
and
in
the
grey
mist
hire
a
boat
at
the
slippery
landing
-
stage
opposite
the
Hawes
Inn
.
<EOS>
refuse
the
assistance
of
the
boatman
,
Ray
take
off
his
coat
and
commence
to
row
to
the
opposite
shore
.
<EOS>
His
action
surprise
me
,
as
we
could
easily
have
go
over
by
the
steam
ferry
.
<EOS>
It
be
high
tide
,
and
by
degree
as
we
get
into
mid
-
stream
he
allow
the
boat
to
drift
towards
one
of
the
set
of
four
circular
caisson
in
which
the
foundation
of
the
gigantic
bridge
,
with
its
bewilder
masse
of
ironwork
,
be
set
.
 
<EOS>
against
one
of
them
the
boat
drift
,
and
he
place
his
hand
upon
the
masonry
to
prevent
a
collision
.
<EOS>
as
he
do
so
,
his
keen
eye
discern
something
which
cause
him
to
pull
back
and
examine
it
more
closely
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
do
so
,
a
train
rumble
high
above
us
.
 
<EOS>
with
curiosity
I
follow
the
direction
of
his
gaze
,
but
what
I
see
convey
to
me
nothing
.
<EOS>
about
two
foot
above
high
-
water
mark
<EOS>
a
stout
iron
staple
have
be
fix
into
the
concrete
.
<EOS>
to
it
be
attach
a
piece
of
thin
wire
rope
descend
into
the
water
,
apparently
use
by
the
bridge
workman
to
moor
their
boat
.
 
<EOS>
have
carefully
examine
the
staple
,
Ray
row
round
to
the
other
three
caisson
,
a
few
foot
distant
,
but
there
discover
nothing
.
<EOS>
afterwards
,
with
my
assistance
,
he
pull
back
to
the
Dalmeny
side
,
where
,
at
the
base
of
one
of
the
high
square
brick
pier
of
the
shore
end
of
the
bridge
,
the
third
from
the
land
,
he
find
a
similar
staple
drive
.
<EOS>
then
we
return
to
the
pier
and
cross
to
North
Queensferry
.
 
<EOS>
My
friend
's
next
move
be
to
enter
the
post
office
and
there
write
upon
a
yellow
form
<EOS>
a
telegram
in
German
address
to
a
person
in
Berlin
.
<EOS>
this
he
hand
to
the
pleasant
-
faced
Scotch
postmistress
,
who
,
on
see
it
in
a
strange
language
,
regard
him
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
remark
that
he
suppose
she
do
not
often
transmit
message
in
German
,
whereupon
she
say
:
 
"
<EOS>
oh
,
yes
.
<EOS>
the
german
waiter
up
at
the
Golf
Club
send
them
sometimes
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be
he
the
only
german
you
have
in
North
Queensferry
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquire
casually
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
hear
of
any
other
,
sir
,
"
reply
the
good
woman
,
and
then
we
both
wish
her
good
-
day
and
leave
.
 
<EOS>
Our
next
action
be
to
climb
the
Ferry
Hill
at
the
back
of
the
post
office
,
pass
the
station
and
Carlingnose
Fort
,
until
we
reach
the
club
-
house
of
the
Dunfermline
Golf
Club
,
which
command
a
fine
prospect
over
the
wide
estuary
eastward
.
 
<EOS>
no
one
appear
to
be
play
that
morning
,
but
on
enter
the
club
we
be
approach
by
a
fair
-
headed
,
rather
smart
-
look
german
waiter
.
<EOS>
His
age
be
about
thirty
,
his
fair
moustache
well
train
,
and
his
hair
closely
crop
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
inquiry
for
an
imaginary
person
,
and
by
that
means
be
enable
to
engage
the
man
in
conversation
.
<EOS>
Ray
,
on
his
part
,
remark
that
he
would
be
stay
in
the
neighbourhood
for
some
time
,
and
request
a
list
of
member
and
term
of
membership
.
<EOS>
in
response
,
the
waiter
fetch
him
a
book
of
rule
,
which
he
place
in
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
as
we
descend
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
"
to
me
,
"
my
friend
remark
,
"
there
be
only
one
suspicious
fact
about
that
man
--
his
nationality
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
afternoon
we
spend
out
at
the
naval
office
,
where
I
be
introduce
to
the
Superintendent
and
the
second
officer
,
and
where
I
stand
by
while
my
friend
again
examine
the
big
green
-
paint
safe
,
closely
investigate
its
lock
with
the
aid
of
his
magnify
glass
.
<EOS>
It
be
apparent
that
those
in
charge
regard
him
as
a
harmless
crank
,
for
so
confident
<EOS>
be
they
that
no
spy
have
be
able
to
get
at
the
plan
that
no
night
watch
have
ever
be
keep
upon
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
through
five
consecutive
night
,
unknown
to
the
caretaker
,
who
sleep
so
peacefully
in
his
bungalow
,
we
,
however
,
keep
a
vigilant
watch
upon
the
place
.
<EOS>
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
whatever
information
our
friend
the
Germans
want
they
seem
to
have
already
obtain
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
Raymond
,
however
,
continue
to
display
that
quiet
,
methodical
patience
bear
of
enthusiasm
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
confident
that
something
be
afoot
,
and
that
there
be
spy
in
the
neighbourhood
,
"
he
would
say
.
 
<EOS>
nearly
a
fortnight
we
spend
,
sometimes
in
Edinburgh
,
and
at
other
idle
about
North
Queensferry
in
the
guise
of
english
tourist
,
for
the
Forth
Bridge
be
still
an
attraction
to
the
sightseer
.
 
<EOS>
upon
the
german
waiter
at
the
Golf
Club
Ray
be
keep
a
watchful
eye
.
<EOS>
He
have
discover
his
name
to
be
Heinrich
Klauber
,
and
that
before
his
engagement
there
he
have
be
a
waiter
in
the
basement
cafe
of
the
Hotel
de
l'Europe
,
in
Leicester
Square
,
London
.
 
<EOS>
His
movement
be
in
no
way
suspicious
.
<EOS>
He
live
at
a
small
cottage
nearly
opposite
the
post
office
at
North
Queensferry
with
a
widow
name
Macdonald
,
and
he
have
fall
in
love
with
a
rather
pretty
dark
-
eyed
girl
name
Elsie
Robinson
,
who
live
with
her
father
in
the
grey
High
Street
of
Inverkeithing
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
my
observation
go
--
and
it
often
fall
to
my
lot
to
watch
his
movement
while
Ray
be
absent
--
the
German
be
hardworke
,
thrifty
,
and
a
pattern
of
all
the
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
one
evening
,
however
,
a
curious
incident
occur
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
have
run
up
to
London
,
leave
me
to
watch
the
German
's
movement
.
<EOS>
Klauber
have
return
to
Mrs.
Macdonald
be
about
eight
,
but
not
until
nearly
eleven
do
he
come
forth
again
,
and
then
instead
of
take
his
usual
road
to
inverkeithe
to
meet
the
girl
Robinson
,
he
ascend
the
hill
and
strike
across
the
golf
-
course
until
he
have
gain
its
high
point
,
which
overlook
the
water
of
the
Forth
towards
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
so
suddenly
do
he
halt
that
I
be
compel
to
throw
myself
into
a
bunker
some
distance
away
to
escape
detection
.
<EOS>
then
,
as
I
watch
,
I
see
him
take
from
his
pocket
and
light
a
small
acetylene
lamp
,
<EOS>
apparently
a
bicycle
-
lamp
,
with
a
green
glass
.
<EOS>
He
then
place
it
in
such
a
position
on
the
grass
that
it
could
be
see
from
far
across
the
water
,
and
light
a
cigarette
,
he
wait
.
 
<EOS>
the
light
on
the
Oxcars
be
flash
white
and
red
,
while
from
distant
Inchkeith
stream
a
white
brilliance
at
regular
interval
.
<EOS>
but
the
light
of
Heinrich
Klauber
be
certainly
a
signal
.
<EOS>
to
whom
?
 
<EOS>
He
remain
there
about
half
an
hour
,
but
whether
he
receive
any
answering
signal
I
know
not
.
 
<EOS>
next
night
and
the
next
I
go
to
the
same
spot
,
but
he
fail
to
put
in
an
appearance
.
<EOS>
then
,
in
order
to
report
to
Ray
,
I
join
the
morning
train
from
Perth
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
on
arrival
at
New
Stone
Buildings
I
telephone
to
Bruton
Street
,
but
Chapman
,
his
valet
,
tell
me
that
his
master
have
sleep
there
only
one
night
,
have
receive
a
visit
from
a
respectably
dressed
middle
-
aged
woman
,
and
have
go
away
--
to
an
unknown
destination
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
wait
for
a
whole
week
in
anxiety
and
suspense
,
until
one
morning
I
receive
a
wire
from
him
,
despatch
from
Kirkcaldy
,
urge
me
to
join
him
at
once
at
the
Station
Hotel
in
Perth
.
 
<EOS>
next
morning
at
nine
o'clock
I
be
seat
on
the
side
of
his
bed
,
tell
him
of
the
incident
of
the
lamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
after
a
pause
.
<EOS>
"
My
surmise
be
slowly
prove
correct
,
Jack
.
<EOS>
You
must
buy
a
bicycle
-
lamp
down
in
the
town
and
a
piece
of
green
glass
.
<EOS>
to
-
night
you
must
go
there
at
the
same
hour
and
show
a
similar
light
.
<EOS>
the
matter
seem
far
more
serious
than
I
first
expect
.
<EOS>
the
enemy
be
no
doubt
here
,
in
our
midst
.
<EOS>
take
this
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
handy
before
long
,
"
and
he
take
from
his
kit
-
bag
a
new
.32
colt
revolver
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
,
I
see
that
he
have
resolve
upon
some
bold
stroke
.
 
<EOS>
that
evening
,
after
an
early
dinner
at
the
hotel
,
we
take
train
to
North
Queensferry
,
and
on
alight
at
the
station
he
send
me
up
to
the
golf
-
link
to
show
a
light
for
half
an
hour
;
promise
to
meet
me
later
at
a
certain
point
on
the
road
to
Rosyth
.
 
<EOS>
I
gain
the
lonely
spot
on
the
golf
-
course
and
duly
show
the
light
.
<EOS>
then
I
hasten
to
rejoin
my
friend
at
the
point
he
indicate
,
and
find
him
await
me
behind
some
bush
.
 
<EOS>
almost
at
the
moment
we
meet
,
a
female
figure
come
along
beneath
the
shadow
of
a
high
wall
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
poorly
dress
girl
,
but
the
instant
she
address
my
friend
<EOS>
I
recognise
by
her
refined
voice
that
it
be
Vera
,
the
dainty
daughter
of
the
Admiral
Superintendent
.
 
<EOS>
"
Elsie
be
wait
down
by
the
Ferry
Barns
,
"
she
say
quickly
,
in
a
low
whisper
,
after
greet
me
.
"
<EOS>
Heinrich
have
not
keep
his
appointment
with
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
the
note
?
<EOS>
"
he
ask
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
recollect
what
I
tell
you
concern
the
man
Hartmann
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
reply
.
<EOS>
then
,
address
me
,
she
say
,
"
take
care
of
these
people
Mr.
Jacox
.
<EOS>
They
be
utterly
unscrupulous
"
;
and
she
again
disappear
into
the
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
and
I
turn
and
again
walk
back
in
the
direction
of
Rosyth
.
<EOS>
but
when
we
have
go
a
little
distance
he
tell
me
to
approach
the
naval
office
carefully
,
conceal
myself
in
the
bush
,
and
watch
until
he
join
me
.
<EOS>
on
no
account
be
I
to
make
any
sign
,
whatever
I
may
witness
.
 
<EOS>
though
intensely
cold
the
night
be
not
very
dark
,
therefore
I
be
not
long
in
establish
my
position
at
a
spot
where
I
have
a
good
view
of
the
office
.
<EOS>
then
I
lean
upon
a
tree
-
trunk
and
wait
in
breathless
expectation
.
<EOS>
I
touch
my
father
's
old
repeater
which
I
carry
and
find
it
to
be
a
quarter
past
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
for
over
an
hour
I
remain
there
,
scarce
daring
to
move
a
muscle
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
,
however
,
upon
the
mud
at
the
side
of
the
road
I
hear
soft
footstep
,
and
a
few
moment
later
two
figure
loom
up
from
the
shadow
.
<EOS>
but
when
about
forty
yard
from
the
office
they
halt
,
one
of
the
man
alone
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
with
great
caution
he
climb
the
spiked
railing
,
and
cross
rapidly
to
the
main
door
of
the
office
he
unlock
it
with
a
key
and
enter
,
close
the
door
after
him
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
I
could
distinguish
,
the
man
wear
a
short
beard
,
and
be
dress
in
tweed
and
a
golf
cap
.
<EOS>
hold
my
breath
,
I
see
the
flashing
of
an
electric
torch
within
the
building
.
 
<EOS>
fully
twenty
minute
elapse
before
he
reappear
,
relocke
the
outside
door
,
and
clamber
back
over
the
railing
,
rejoin
his
wait
companion
,
both
be
lose
next
second
in
the
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
I
long
to
follow
them
,
but
Ray
's
instruction
have
be
explicit
--
I
be
to
wait
until
he
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
half
an
hour
later
,
hear
his
low
whistle
<EOS>
,
I
emerge
from
my
hiding
-
place
to
meet
him
and
tell
him
what
I
have
see
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
know
.
<EOS>
We
have
now
no
time
to
lose
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
together
we
hurry
back
over
the
road
towards
North
Queensferry
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
same
spot
where
Vera
have
meet
us
,
we
find
her
still
in
hiding
.
<EOS>
My
friend
whisper
some
word
<EOS>
,
whereupon
she
hurry
on
before
us
to
the
sharp
bend
in
the
road
where
stand
the
telegraph
-
pole
which
have
attract
Ray
on
the
night
of
our
first
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
We
draw
back
in
the
shadow
,
and
as
we
do
so
<EOS>
I
see
her
halt
and
pull
the
bell
beside
a
small
gate
in
a
high
wall
.
<EOS>
behind
stand
a
white
-
washed
cottage
,
with
a
good
-
sized
garden
at
the
rear
.
<EOS>
one
end
of
the
house
abut
upon
the
pathway
,
and
in
it
be
one
small
window
command
a
view
of
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
Vera
,
we
see
,
have
some
conversation
with
the
old
woman
who
answer
her
ring
,
and
then
go
in
,
the
gate
be
close
after
her
.
 
<EOS>
together
we
wait
for
a
considerable
time
,
our
impatience
and
apprehension
increase
.
<EOS>
all
be
silent
,
except
for
a
dog
-
cart
,
in
which
we
recognise
Mr.
Wilkinson
drive
home
from
the
station
.
 
<EOS>
"
curious
that
Vera
do
not
return
,
"
Ray
remark
at
last
,
when
we
have
wait
nearly
three
-
quarter
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
investigate
for
ourselves
.
<EOS>
I
hope
nothing
have
happen
to
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
motion
me
to
follow
,
he
very
cautiously
creep
along
the
muddy
path
and
try
the
gate
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
relocke
.
 
<EOS>
We
therefore
scale
the
wall
without
further
ado
,
and
,
stand
in
the
little
front
garden
,
we
listen
breathlessly
at
the
door
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
get
back
there
in
the
shadow
,
Jack
,
"
urge
my
friend
;
and
,
as
soon
as
I
be
conceal
,
he
pass
his
hand
along
the
lintel
of
the
door
,
where
he
find
the
bell
-
wire
from
the
gate
.
<EOS>
this
he
pull
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
moment
later
the
old
woman
reappear
at
the
door
,
pass
out
towards
the
gate
,
when
,
in
an
instant
,
Ray
and
I
be
within
,
and
fling
open
a
door
on
the
left
of
the
narrow
passage
we
find
ourselves
confront
by
the
exemplary
waiter
Klauber
and
a
companion
,
whose
short
beard
and
snub
nose
I
recognise
as
those
of
the
man
who
so
calmly
enter
the
naval
office
a
couple
of
hour
before
.
 
<EOS>
for
them
our
sudden
appearance
be
,
no
doubt
,
a
dramatic
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
the
eld
man
give
vent
to
a
quick
imprecation
in
German
,
while
Klauber
,
of
course
,
recognise
us
both
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
room
be
a
large
camera
with
a
flashlight
apparatus
,
while
pin
upon
a
screen
before
the
camera
be
a
big
tracing
of
a
plan
of
one
of
the
chief
defensive
fort
which
the
spy
have
that
night
secure
from
Rosyth
,
and
which
they
be
now
in
the
act
of
photographing
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
lady
call
upon
you
here
an
hour
ago
,
"
exclaim
Ray
.
<EOS>
"
where
be
she
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
lady
have
call
here
,
"
reply
the
bearded
German
in
very
good
English
,
add
with
marvellous
coolness
,
"
to
what
,
pray
,
do
we
owe
this
unwarrantable
intrusion
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
to
the
fact
that
I
recognise
you
as
Josef
Scholtz
,
secret
agent
of
the
German
Naval
Intelligence
Department
,
"
answer
my
friend
resolutely
,
close
the
door
and
stand
with
his
back
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
meet
before
.
<EOS>
You
be
come
down
the
step
of
a
house
in
Pont
Street
,
London
,
where
live
a
great
friend
of
yours
,
Hermann
Hartmann

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
?
"
ask
the
German
,
with
feign
unconcern
,
and
before
we
could
prevent
him
he
have
tear
the
tracing
from
the
screen
,
roughly
fold
it
,
and
stuff
it
into
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
hand
that
to
me
,
"
command
my
friend
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
spy
only
laugh
in
open
defiance
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
intend
,
no
doubt
,
to
replace
that
as
you
have
do
the
other
after
photograph
them
.
<EOS>
only
we
have
just
spoilt
your
game
,
"
Raymond
say
.
<EOS>
"
both
Mr.
Wilkinson
and
Mr.
Farrar
be
,
I
see
from
the
list
,
member
of
the
Golf
Club
where
you"--and
he
look
across
to
the
waiter--"are

<EOS>
on
one
occasion
,
while
Mr.
Wilkinson
be
take
a
bath
after
a
game
,
and
on
another
while
Mr.

be
change
his

you
contrive
to
take
wax
impression
of
both
the
safe

also
that
of
the
door
of

<EOS>
the
key

by
their

the
plan
of

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
--
there
be
no

"
<EOS>
cry
Scholtz
.
<EOS>
"
let
me
pass
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
first
give
me
that
trace
,
"
demand
my
friend
resolutely
.
 
<EOS>
"
never
.
<EOS>
do
your
bad
!
"
<EOS>
the
German
reply
,
speak
with
a
more
pronounce
accent
in
his
excitement
,
while
at
the
same
moment
I
see
that
he
hold
a
revolver
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
in
an
instant
Ray
draw
his
own
weapon
,
but
,
instead
of
cover
the
spy
,
he
point
it
at
a
small
,
strong
wooden
box
upon
the
floor
in
the
opposite
corner
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gott
--
no
!
"
gasp
the
man
,
his
face
blanch
as
he
realise
Ray
's
intention
.
"
<EOS>
for
Heaven
's
sake
do
not
.
<EOS>
I
--
i----
"
 
"
ah
!
"
<EOS>
laugh
my
friend
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
it
be
as
I
think
.
<EOS>
You
two
blackguard
,
with
some
of
your
friend
<EOS>
,
I
expect
,
have
be
secretly
prepare
for
the
destruction
of
the
Forth
Bridge
on
'
the
day'--as
you
be
so
fond
of
call
it
.
<EOS>
the
staple
be
already
drive
in
,
and
the
unsuspicious
-
looking
wire
rope
,
attach
to
which
the
box
of
gun
-
cotton
and
other
explosive
be
to
be
sink
between
the
four
caisson
,
be
all
in
readiness
.
<EOS>
the
boat
from
a
german
merchant
vessel
off
Leith
,
signal
at
interval
by
your
assistant
Klauber
,
have
be
bring
up
box
after
box
of
that
dangerous
stuff
and
land
it
at
the
bottom
of
this
garden
;
so
that
within
an
hour
of
receive
the
code
-
word
from
your
chief
,
you
would
be
able
to
wreck
the
whole
bridge
and
blow
it
into
the
water
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
spy
endeavour
to
pass
,
but
see
Ray
's
determined
attitude
,
hold
back
,
and
my
friend
compel
him
to
lay
down
his
weapon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
,
"
say
my
friend
,
"
just
see
what
be
in
that
box
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
at
once
investigate
it
,
and
discover
within
only
innocent
-
look
tin
box
of
english
biscuit
.
<EOS>
the
three
tin
at
the
top
I
lift
out
and
place
on
the
floor
,
but
those
below
I
find
be
fill
with
circular
cake
of
what
look
like
feel
,
about
an
inch
in
thickness
,
each
with
a
hole
through
it
,
and
with
a
small
cavity
for
the
reception
of
the
detonator
.
<EOS>
I
show
it
to
Ray
,
point
out
that
,
pack
with
it
,
be
several
small
tin
,
like
box
of
cigarette
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
I
see
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
as
I
open
one
.
<EOS>
"
those
be
the
detonator
,
fill
with
fulminate
of
mercury
.
"
 
"
let
us
pass
!
"
cry
both
the
spy
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
before
you
be
search
<EOS>
shall
you
leave
this
house
!
"
be
the
quick
reply
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
resist
,
I
shall
fire
into
one
of
those
box
of
detonator
,
and
blow
you
to
atom
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
yourself
also
!
"
remark
Klauber
,
his
face
pale
as
death
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
at
least
prevent
our
secret
fall
into
your
hand
,
and
at
the
same
time
bring
the
truth
home
to
the
british
Government
!
"
<EOS>
be
my
friend
's
unwavering
answer
.
 
<EOS>
next
moment
both
man
make
a
dash
towards
the
door
,
but
I
have
draw
my
weapon
and
be
upon
my
guard
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
flash
,
follow
by
a
deafen
report
,
as
Ray
fire
at
the
box
,
aim
wide
on
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
two
spy
,
see
that
they
have
to
deal
with
a
man
who
be
a
patriot
to
his
heart
's
core
,
realise
that
their
game
be
up
.
 
<EOS>
Sullenly
Scholtz
put
down
his
weapon
,
and
I
search
both
man
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
pocket
of
the
exemplary
waiter
I
draw
forth
a
rough
plan
,
together
with
some
scribble
note
in
German
,
which
afterwards
prove
to
be
a
description
of
the
fort
on
Inchkeith
,
while
from
the
pocket
of
Scholtz
<EOS>
I
secure
the
tracing
he
have
steal
from
Rosyth
.
 
<EOS>
then
we
allow
both
the
secret
agent
of
the
Kaiser
to
pass
out
,
much
to
the
consternation
and
alarm
of
the
deaf
old
Scotchwoman
,
who
have
,
at
their
request
,
pose
as
the
occupier
of
the
cottage
,
but
who
,
in
perfect
ignorance
of
what
be
in
progress
,
have
act
as
their
housekeeper
.
 
<EOS>
a
swift
examination
of
the
premise
reveal
no
trace
of
Vera
.
<EOS>
but
we
find
in
the
cellar
below
the
room
where
we
have
find
the
spy
a
great
store
of
gun
-
cotton
and
other
high
explosive
of
german
manufacture
,
intend
for
the
wrecking
of
the
bridge
;
while
in
an
old
batter
portmanteau
in
one
of
the
upstairs
room
we
also
find
,
all
ready
for
conveyance
to
Germany
,
a
quantity
of
print
from
the
photographic
negative
in
the
room
below
--
photograph
of
nearly
the
whole
of
the
plan
of
Rosyth
,
and
more
especially
of
its
propose
fort
--
which
the
man
have
be
in
the
habit
of
abstract
at
night
and
replace
in
the
safe
before
dawn
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
Raymond
be
in
active
search
of
something
else
besides
,
and
at
length
discover
what
he
seek
--
two
german
military
telegraph
instrument
,
together
with
a
complete
and
very
ingenious
arrangement
for
the
tapping
of
wire
.
 
<EOS>
"
by
Jove
!
"
exclaim
my
friend
,
who
take
a
keen
interest
in
all
thing
electrical
.
<EOS>
"
this
will
now
come
in
very
handy
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
on
go
outside
to
the
telegraph
pole
against
the
wall
,
he
clamber
up
it
and
attach
wire
to
two
of
the
insulator
.
<EOS>
then
descend
,
he
screw
a
little
brass
box
upon
it
into
those
same
three
hole
in
the
black
wood
which
have
attract
him
on
the
night
of
our
arrival
,
and
a
moment
later
begin
manipulate
the
key
.
 
<EOS>
"
good
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
pick
up
inverkeithing
,
and
ask
them
to
send
the
police
over
at
once
.
<EOS>
We
must
not
leave
the
place
and
risk
the
spy
return
for
any
of
their
paraphernalia
.
<EOS>
the
disappearance
of
Vera
,
however
,
worry
me
.
<EOS>
I
send
her
here
with
a
note
purport
to
come
from
the
chief
of
the
german
Secret
Service
in
England
,
Hermann
Hartmann
;
but
she
have
vanish
,
and
we
must
,
as
soon
as
the
police
arrive
,
go
in
search
of
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
completely
have
we
unmask
the
spy
that
I
stand
puzzled
and
amazed
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
,
notice
my
attitude
,
make
explanation
.
 
<EOS>
"
several
of
my
surmise
in
this
case
prove
entirely
correct
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
My
first
suspicion
be
arouse
that
if
spy
be
about
,
they
would
probably
prepare
for
tap
the
telegraph
line
,
and
,
as
you
know
,
I
soon
discover
evidence
of
it
.
<EOS>
then
those
staple
in
the
foundation
of
the
bridge
give
me
a
further
clue
to
the
work
in
progress
,
a
suspicion
greatly
strengthen
by
the
signal
light
show
by
the
man
Klauber
.
<EOS>
the
two
man
who
hold
the
safe
key
be
member
of
the
Golf
Club
arouse
a
theory
which
prove
the
correct
one
,
and
on
trace
back
the
career
of
the
waiter
I
make
a
remarkable
discovery
which
leave
no
doubt
as
to
his
real
profession
.
<EOS>
It
seem
that
while
employ
at
the
Cafe
de
l'Europe
in
London
,
he
lodge
at
the
house
of
Mrs.
Jephson
,
in
Shepherd
's
Bush
,
and
become
extremely
friendly
with
the
widow
's
son
.
<EOS>
now
you
will
remember
that
a
few
day
before
the
poor
fellow
's
death
he
be
absent
mysteriously
,
and
on
his
return
he
tell
his
mother
in
confidence
that
there
would
shortly
be
something
in
the
paper
about
himself
.
<EOS>
well
,
the
truth
be
now
quite
plain
.
<EOS>
during
his
absence
he
evidently
come
up
here
.
<EOS>
young
Jephson
,
who
know
German
,
have
find
out
that
his
german
friend
be
a
spy
,
and
have
no
doubt
secure
the
document
afterwards
find
upon
him
as
evidence
.
<EOS>
Klauber
be
ignorant
of
this
,
though
he
suspect
that
his
secret
be
out
.
<EOS>
in
deadly
fear
of
exposure
,
he
then
plot
to
silence
the
young
Englishman
,
induce
him
to
walk
along
the
towing
-
path
between
Hammersmith
and
Barnes
,
where
he
no
doubt
push
him
into
the
river
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
have
find
a
witness
who
see
the
two
man
together
in
King
Street
,
Hammersmith
,
on
the
evening
of
the
poor
fellow
's
disappearance
.
<EOS>
the
plan
which
Reitmeyer
see
be
,
I
find
,
fortunately
one
of
the
discard
one
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
extraordinary
!
<EOS>
"
I
declare
,
absorb
by
what
he
have
relate
.
"
<EOS>
but
while
you
have
wrest
from
Germany
the
secret
of
some
of
our
most
important
defence
,
you
have
,
my
dear
Ray
,
temporarily
lose
the
woman
you
love
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
first
duty
,
Jack
,
be
to
my
King
and
my
country
,
"
he
declare
,
sit
on
the
edge
of
the
table
in
the
spy
'
photographic
studio
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
try
to
perform
it
to
-
night
,
and
have
,
fortunately
,
expose
the
german
activity
in
our
midst
.
<EOS>
when
the
police
arrive
to
view
this
spy
'
nest
,
we
must
at
once
search
for
her
who
be
always
my
confidante
,
and
to
whose
woman
's
wit
and
foresight
this
success
be
in
no
small
measure
due
.

CHAPTER
ii
 
the
SECRET
of
the
silent
SUBMARINE
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
most
mysterious
affair
,
no
doubt
,
"
I
remark
.
"
<EOS>
have
anything
further
be
discover
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes

Jack

"
reply
my
friend
Ray
Raymond
,
roll
a
fresh
cigarette
between
his
finger
.
<EOS>
"
on
investigation
,
the
mystery
grow
more
complicated
,
more
remarkable
,
and
--
for
us
--
much
more
interesting
.
"
 
<EOS>
We
be
seat
together
in
our
dismal
chamber
in
New
Stone
Buildings
,
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
one
wet
afternoon
about
six
week
after
the
Forth
Bridge
affair
.
<EOS>
with
us
,
loll
in
the
shabby
old
easy
chair
beside
the
fire
,
sit
Vera
Vallance
,
in
a
big
black
hat
,
with
her
muff
and
coat
throw
aside
.
<EOS>
Her
disappearance
at
North
Queensferry
have
be
of
only
brief
duration
,
for
we
have
discover
her
hiding
at
the
bottom
of
the
long
garden
,
close
to
the
water
's
edge
,
watch
the
landing
of
two
small
box
from
a
boat
.
<EOS>
It
appear
that
the
two
man
,
Scholtz
and
Klauber
,
on
receipt
of
the
note
purport
to
come
from
their
director
,
Hermann
Hartmann
,
in
London
,
have
ask
her
to
wait
in
an
adjoining
room
while
they
write
a
reply
.
<EOS>
but
from
there
she
have
slip
out
,
and
conceal
herself
in
the
garden
to
wait
and
watch
.
 
<EOS>
half
an
hour
ago
she
have
come
to
my
gloomy
chamber
with
her
fiance
,
in
order
,
as
he
explain
,
to
consult
with
us
.
<EOS>
She
be
at
present
on
a
visit
to
her
married
sister
who
live
in
Argyll
Road
,
near
Kensington
High
Street
,
hence
they
be
daily
in
each
other
's
company
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Jack
,
very
little
have
be
allow
to
leak
out
to
the
paper
,
"
Ray
exclaim
as
he
light
his
cigarette
and
take
up
a
position
with
his
back
to
the
fire
.
"
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
read
of
the
discovery
I
run
down
to
Scotland
Yard
,
see
Evans
,
and
explain
my

as
soon
as
I
read
the
first
announcement
in

paper
,
I
go
down
to
Guildford
and
there
ascertain
that
the
injure
man
arrive
at
the
Angel
Hotel
in
a
motor
-
car
about
one
o'clock
.
<EOS>
the
chauffeur
remark
to
the
ostler
that
he
have
come
up
from

after
have
a

start
off

<EOS>
Steinheim
have
luncheon
upstairs

take
his

about

the

he

expect
a

<EOS>
the
friend
in
question
do
not
,
however

arrive

therefore
he
walk
down
to
the
station

and
leave
at
4.13
for
London

<EOS>
a
porter
remember
see
him
alone
in
the
compartment

and
it
seem
quite
certain
that
,
on
start
from

he
be
still
alone

<EOS>
the
train
be
an
express
,
and
time
not
to
stop
anywhere
from
Guildford
to
Vauxhall

,
from
the
railway
official

I
find
that
it
be
pull
up

about
a

from

time
he
may
have
be
join
by
some
one
from

adjoin
compartment

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

then
your
theory
be
that
the
man
who
attack
this
mysterious
German
get
back
again
to
his
carriage
,
and
alight
at
Vauxhall
,

I
say

I
certainly
think
so

for
the
driver
say
that
outside
Clapham
Junction
the
signal
be
against
him

he
pull
up

would
never

It
be
to
his
advantage
to
conceal
the
fact

if
my
deduction
prove
correct

be
those
all

one
other
.
<EOS>
a
week
after
the
man
's
disappearance

his
landlady
receive
a
letter
bear
the
postmark

tell
her
not

burn
this

<EOS>
the
other
fact
I
learn
from
the
man
's
employer
,
an
Englishman
in
New
Bond
Street
.
<EOS>
It
appear
that
to
the
establishment
there
often
come
a
stout
,
well
-
dress
,
prosperous
-
look
german
gentleman
who
wait
for
Steinheim
to
shave
him
,
or
cut
his
hair
,
and
on
such
occasion
it
be
notice
that
they
exchange
whisper
word
in
their
own
tongue
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
?
"
ask
Vera
,
look
up
at
her
lover

<EOS>
"
the
stout
German
's
description
tally
exactly
with
that
of
Hermann
Hartmann
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
I
see
,
"
I
remark
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
certainly
not
be
idle
,
Ray
.
"
<EOS>
and
with
my
eye
fix
upon
that
puzzling
array
of
figure
and
word
,
I
add
,
"
if
we
could
only
decipher
the
whole
of
these
we
may
elucidate
the
truth
.
"
 
"
the
injure
man
's
knowledge
of
Hartmann
,
the
crafty
chief
of
the
german
Secret
Service
in
London
,
be
certainly
suspicious

Vera
remark
.
"
but
can
not
some
information
be
gather
from
the
landlady
at
Hargwynne
Street
?
<EOS>
He
may
have
have
visitor
there
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
if
he
do
,
they
would
speak
in
German
,
which
the
good
lady
could
not
understand

her
lover
reply
thoughtfully
,
contemplate
the
end
of
his
cigarette

<EOS>
"
there
could
be
no
harm

the
good

the
girl
remark
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
over
to

morrow

have
a
chat
with
her

<EOS>
"
and
in
the
meantime
Jack

I
will
pursue
another
line
of
inquiry

<EOS>
Vera
rise
,
a
tall
,
fair
-
haired
,
and
sweet
-
faced
figure
in
black
,
and
seat
herself
at
the
table
,
serve
us
our
tea
.
<EOS>
She
be
no
stranger
at
our
chamber
,
and
as
an
Admiral
's
daughter
,
the
question
of
german
spy
in
England
,
which
her
lover
have
take
up
so
strongly
,
interest
her
most
keenly
.
<EOS>
the
Forth
Bridge
peril
have
already
impress
a
great
and
serious
truth
upon
the
Government
,
but
Ray
Raymond
's
success
have
only
whet
his
appetite
for
further
exploration
and
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
on
the
follow
morning
I
call
at
his
chamber
in
Bruton
Street
--
a
tastefully
furnished
bachelor
suite
,
the
art
green
and
blue
of
which
be
scarcely
in
keep
with
his
serious
,
earnest
character
--
and
together
we
drive
in
a
taxi
-
cab
to
St.
Thomas
's
Hospital
,
where
,
in
the
accident
ward
,
we
stand
at
the
bedside
of
the
mysterious
Steinheim
.
<EOS>
His
head
be
envelop
in
surgical
bandage
,
but
during
the
night
he
have
regain
consciousness
.
<EOS>
to
the
question
we
put
to
him
,
however
,
we
obtain
no
satisfactory
reply
.
<EOS>
His
mind
seem
to
be
a
perfect
blank
as
to
what
have
occur
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
read
the
copy
of
those
cryptic
figure
upon
the
scrap
of
paper
find
in
the
railway
carriage
.
<EOS>
when
my
friend
pronounce
the
name
of
the
station
"
Weldon
and
Corby
,
"
the
invalid
's
big
grey
eye
start
from
his
head
as
he
exclaim
in
German
:
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
yes
--
yes
.
<EOS>
at
Weldon
.
<EOS>
She
be
at
Weldon
!
"
 
<EOS>
who
be
"
she
"
?
<EOS>
in
vain
we
try
to
wring
from
him
some
reply
to
this
question
,
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
mention
of
Hermann
Hartmann
,
the
ingenious
and
fearless
secret
agent
who
control
so
cleverly
the
vast
army
of
german
spy
spread
over
our
smile
land
of
England
,
bring
no
responsive
expression
to
the
man
's
white
,
draw
face
.
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
apparent
that
his
intention
be
to
hold
back
at
all
hazard
the
truth
regard
the
murderous
attack
upon
him
.
<EOS>
perhaps
he
himself
be
guilty
of
some
offence
,
or
perhaps
he
intend
to
hold
his
peace
then
and
to
retaliate
at
a
moment
when
his
assailant
think
himself
most
secure
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
big
,
burly
,
strong
-
featured
man
,
just
the
type
of
heavy
-
limbed
German
who
may
be
expect
to
bear
a
murderous
malice
against
any
who
do
him
injury

<EOS>
"
I
feel
more
than
ever
convince
that
Hartmann
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
curious
affair
,
"
Ray
declare
,
as
we
walk
together
across
Westminster
Bridge
<EOS>
and
I
cross
with
him
to
the
St.
Stephen
's
Club
,
at
the
corner
of
the
Embankment
.
<EOS>
"
as
far
as
I
can
discover
,
the
man
be
always
in
possession
of
ample
fund
.
<EOS>
yet
to
his
landlady
he
be
careful
never
to
reveal
that
he
have
money

<EOS>
there
be
,
no
doubt
,
some
hide
reason
for
this

as
well
as
for
the
letter
he
write
to
the
woman
after
his
departure

<EOS>
"
the
mystery
surround
the
affair
grow
more
fascinating
as
we
proceed

I
declare
.

if
the
deduction
I
have
make
this
morning
prove
to
be
the
correct
one

Jack
,
the
mystery
will
still
increase

be
some
very
crooked
business
in
progress

depend
upon
it

"
 
<EOS>
that
afternoon
I
have
to
make
an
application
in
the
Chancery
Court
,
therefore
it
be
not
until
after
dinner
that
I
again
sit
in
one
of
the
green
velvet
chair
in
his
art

green

<EOS>
Contrary
to

still

the

in
Stockwell

can
make
nothing
of
her

She

She
return

night

<EOS>
We
smoke
together
until
ten
,
he
consume
cigarette
after
cigarette
in
that
quick
,
nervous
manner
which
show
the
volcano
of
excitement
rage
within
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
think
why
the
mention
of
Weldon
and
Corby
should
have
so
excite
our
friend
this
morning
.
<EOS>
to
me
it
seem
as
though
he
retain
rather
bitter
memory
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
there
be
a
woman
in
the
case
,
without
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Jack
,
I
shall
go
down
there
and
have
a
look
round
as
soon
as
I
have
a
chance
.
<EOS>
from
the
ordnance
map
this
place
seem
quite
a
small
one
.
<EOS>
the
station
be
at
Corby
,
while
Little
Weldon
and
Great
Weldon
be
about
a
mile
distant
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
just
a
chance
,
of
course
,
that
you
may
pick
up
something
there
,
"
I
remark
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
yet
what
I
surmise
lead
me
in
entirely
an
opposite
direction
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
defence
or
secret
in
Northamptonshire
,
remember
.
<EOS>
"
 
once
more
he
take
from
his
writing
-
table
the
piece
of
paper
whereon
be
a
copy
of
the
strange
array
of
figure
find
in
the
railway
carriage
at
Waterloo
.
<EOS>
but
at
last
he
shake
his
head
and
lay
it
aside
with
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
the
mystery
remain
as
complete
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
good
deal
that
be
suspicious
about
Hartmann
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
that
be
why
we
be
go
to
Pont
Street
?
<EOS>
"
I
remark
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
as
I
have
explain
,
he
be
believe
to
be
a
money
-
lender
with
an
office
in
Cork
Street
,
and
be
register
as
such
,
in
order
that
no
one
should
be
surprised
at
the
constant
caller
at
his
house
.
<EOS>
He
receive
visit
from
all
sort
and
condition
of
man
--
and
woman
,
but
observation
which
I
have
place
upon
the
house
have
convince
me
that
the
majority
of
these
people
be
german
agent
of
whom
he
be
the
guide
spirit
and
paymaster
,
and
among
whom
he
be
all

powerful

payment
be
make
through
him
for
all
confidential
service
render
to
the
Fatherland

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
the
police
do
not
suspect
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
fellow
,
have
not
the
police
receive
order
from
our
Government
to
close
their
eye
to
the
doing
of
these
gentry
?
<EOS>
England
be
the
paradise
of
the
spy
,
and
will
remain
so
until
we
can
bring
pressure
to
bear
to
compel
the
introduction
of
fresh
legislation
against
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
soon
after
half
-
past
ten
a
taxi
-
cab
deposit
us
in
Sloane
Street
,
and
together
we
turn
into
Pont
Street
,
walk
leisurely
past
a
medium
-
sized
red
-
front
house
approach
by
a
flight
of
step
lead
to
a
deep
portico
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
light
in
the
first
-
floor
window
of
what
be
evidently
the
drawing
-
room
but
the
rest
of
the
house
of
the
arch
-
spy
of
Germany
be
in
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
pass
the
house
,
my
friend
examine
its
highly
respectable
exterior
.
<EOS>
then
we
pass
on
to
the
end
of
the
thoroughfare
,
in
order
to
attract
no
attention
.
<EOS>
a
constable
pass
us
,
and
in
order
to
avoid
be
notice
we
walk
together
for
some
distance
.
<EOS>
presently
,
however
,
Ray
turn
back
,
and
gain
the
house
adjoin
Hartmann
's
,
run
swiftly
up
the
step
into
the
shadow
of
the
portico
,
I
follow
at
his
heel
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
few
second
he
have
open
the
door
with
a
latch
-
key
he
carry
in
his
hand
,
and
next
moment
we
be
within
the
wide
,
echo
hall
,
for
the
house
be
empty
,
and
to
let
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
call
upon
the
agent
,
and
have
a
look
over
this
place
a
few
day
ago
,
"
he
explain
.
<EOS>
"
on
that
occasion
,
I
have
the
key
in
my
hand
for
a
moment
,
and
obtain
an
impression
of
it
,
"
and
switch
on
his
electric
torch
he
show
the
square
hall
with
the
flight
of
stair
ascend
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
gain
the
big
drawing
-
room
,
Ray
cross
to
the
long
french
window
on
the
left
and
gaze
cautiously
out
upon
the
street
below
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
do
so
I
notice
the
figure
of
a
man
in
a
dark
overcoat
and
feel
hat
cross
from
the
opposite
pavement
and
ascend
the
stair
of
the
house
next
door
.
<EOS>
Ray
glance
at
his
watch
,
which
he
could
see
by
the
light
of
the
street
lamp
outside
.
<EOS>
notice
the
time
,
he
become
reassured
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Jack
,
that
from
here
run
a
balcony
lead
to
that
of
Hartmann
's
house
.
<EOS>
We
must
creep
along
it
and
try
and
get
a
peep
of
our
friend
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
have
watch
that
draw
-
room
window
for
a
long
time
,
and
I
believe
that
he
make
it
his
business
room
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
carefully
he
unfasten
the
french
window
,
and
bend
low
so
as
to
escape
the
observation
of
any
person
pass
by
<EOS>
,
we
both
creep
along
the
narrow
balcony
until
,
by
swinge
from
one
balustrade
to
the
other
,
we
find
ourselves
stand
over
Hartmann
's
portico
.
 
<EOS>
even
from
where
we
stand
we
could
hear
voice
.
<EOS>
forward
we
creep
again
until
we
be
outside
the
window
of
the
drawing
-
room
,
crouch
so
that
no
inquisitive
policeman
could
detect
us
.
 
<EOS>
the
blind
of
the
window
at
which
I
listen
do
not
fit
well
,
therefore
,
through
the
small
crack
,
I
be
enable
to
peer
within
.
<EOS>
the
room
be
a
large
,
well
-
furnish
one
with
a
fire
burn
brightly
;
near
it
stand
a
large
roll
-
top
writing
-
table
at
which
sit
a
fat
,
flabby
,
sardonic
-
faced
man
of
about
fifty
-
five
.
<EOS>
He
have
grey
eye
full
of
craft
and
cunning
,
a
prominent
nose
,
and
a
short
-
crop
grey
beard
.
<EOS>
Ray
whisper
that
it
be
the
great
Hartmann
.
 
<EOS>
near
the
fire
,
seat
nervously
on
the
extreme
edge
of
a
chair
,
be
a
respectably
dress
man
,
a
German
evidently
,
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
the
man
present
the
appearance
of
a
hard
-
work
mechanic
,
and
be
obviously
ill
at
ease
.
 
<EOS>
We
watch
them
in
conversation
,
but
could
not
distinguish
one
single
word
of
what
be
say
.
<EOS>
all
we
could
gather
be
that
the
fat
man
be
overbear
in
his
manner
,
and
that
the
visitor
be
most
humble
and
subservient
against
his
will
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
full
half
-
hour
we
watch
,
but
unable
to
gather
anything
further
,
we
be
compel
to
return
to
the
house
next
door
and
regain
the
street
,
where
for
still
twenty
minute
longer
we
wait
for
the
visitor
's
exit
.
<EOS>
when
at
last
he
come
forth
we
follow
him
to
the
corner
of
Knightsbridge
,
opposite
<EOS>
the
Hyde
Park
Hotel
,
where
he
board
a
motor
-
bus
,
from
which
he
eventually
descend
at
the
corner
of
Gray
's
Inn
Road
walk
thence
to
a
house
in
Harpur
Street
,
Bloomsbury
,
where
we
later
on
discover
he
lodge
,
under
the
name
of
Leon
Karff
.
 
<EOS>
the
nature
of
the
mission
entrust
to
this
man
,
if
one
have
actually
be
entrust
to
him
,
be
a
mystery
,
yet
it
be
a
curious
fact
that
"
Harpur
Street
"
appear
upon
that
scrap
of
paper
which
to
us
be
such
an
enigma
.
 
<EOS>
next
morning
at
six
o'clock
,
I
be
already
idle
,
at
the
corner
of
Harpur
Street
and
Theobalds
Road
,
but
not
until
three
hour
later
do
the
foreigner
emerge
and
walk
toward
Holborn
.
<EOS>
Thence
<EOS>
he
take
a
motor
-
bus
back
to
Sloane
Street
,
and
call
upon
Hartmann
,
spend
another
half
an
hour
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
afterwards
he
go
straight
home
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
about
noon
,
and
have
an
engagement
in
Court
,
I
be
compel
to
relinquish
my
vigil
.
<EOS>
but
at
a
little
after
five
Ray
enter
our
chamber
,
exclaim
:
 
"
as
I
expect
!
<EOS>
that
man
Karff
have
be
to
see
Steinheim
in
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
I
be
there
await
him
,
believe
that
he
may
visit
him
.
<EOS>
apparently
the
injure
man
have
give
him
certain
instruction
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
about
what
?
"
 
<EOS>
Ray
shrug
his
shoulder
in
blank
ignorance
.
<EOS>
then
he
say
,
"
We
have
advance
one
step
toward
the
solution
of
the
problem
,
my
dear
Jack
.
<EOS>
but
we
have
not
go
very
far
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
take
the
copy
of
the
cryptogram
from
my
writing
-
table
and
again
examine
it
.
<EOS>
the
figure
"
6.11
"
puzzle
him
.
<EOS>
many
time
he
refer
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
four
day
pass
,
during
which
we
keep
strict
observation
upon
Karff
and
follow
him
wherever
he
go
.
<EOS>
on
the
fifth
day
,
Ray
have
spend
all
the
morning
watch
him
,
to
relieve
him
I
walk
along
the
Theobalds
Road
a
few
minute
before
one
and
pause
,
as
usual
,
before
the
oil
shop
at
the
corner
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
sign
of
my
friend
,
and
though
I
wait
through
the
whole
of
that
cold
afternoon
and
evening
,
continue
my
wearisome
vigil
till
midnight
,
yet
he
do
not
come
.
 
<EOS>
much
surprised
,
I
return
to
New
Stone
Buildings
,
where
I
find
a
telegram
from
Ray
,
send
from
Waterloo
Station
at
three
o'clock
,
tell
me
that
all
be
right
,
and
urge
me
to
await
further
information
.
 
<EOS>
this
I
do
.
<EOS>
for
a
whole
week
I
possess
myself
in
patience
,
not
know
where
Ray
be
or
what
have
befall
him
.
<EOS>
that
he
be
on
the
trail
of
a
solution
of
the
mystery
be
evident
,
but
he
send
me
no
word
of
his
whereabouts
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
apparent
,
however
,
that
he
be
no
longer
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
eleven
day
after
his
disappearance
I
one
afternoon
receive
another
telegram
,
which
have
be
hand
in
at
Chichester
,
ask
me
to
go
at
once
to
the
Queen
's
hotel
at
Southsea
,
where
he
would
meet
me
at
ten
o'clock
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
hour
appoint
I
await
him
in
my
bedroom
overlook
Southsea
Common
and
the
harbour
,
and
at
last
he
join
me
.
<EOS>
I
see
by
the
serious
expression
upon
his
face
that
something
unusual
have
happen
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
fellow
Karff
have
realise
that
I
be
follow
him
,
Jack
.
<EOS>
therefore
you
must
take
the
matter
up
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
the
service
of
a
greengrocer
in
Queen
Street
,
close
to
the
Hard
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
discover
his
game
.
"
 
<EOS>
thus
there
be
leave
to
me
a
very
difficult
matter
,
a
mystery
which
I
exert
every
effort
to
unravel
.
<EOS>
for
the
next
fortnight
I
watch
the
fellow
incessantly
,
be
relieve
sometimes
by
the
pretty
daughter
of
the
Admiral
Superintendent
,
whose
home
be
fortunately
in
the
Dockyard
.
<EOS>
in
all
weather
and
at
all
time
we
watch
,
but
we
fail
to
discover
anything
.
<EOS>
Ray
remain
at
the
hotel
impatient
and
inactive
,
and
I
must
admit
that
more
than
once
I
be
inclined
to
believe
that
he
have
be
mistake
in
his
surmise
.
<EOS>
Leon
Karff
be
,
as
far
as
we
could
discover
,
a
hard
-
work
foreigner
,
drive
by
force
of
circumstance
into
adopt
the
lowly
calling
of
a
greengrocer
's
assistant
.
<EOS>
His
employer
supply
with
fruit
and
vegetable
the
officer
'
mess
of
several
of
the
ship
in
the
Dockyard
,
and
on
infrequent
occasion
he
drive
in
the
light
cart
with
his
master
when
on
his
round
take
order
.
 
<EOS>
this
round
at
last
<EOS>
he
be
in
the
habit
of
make
three
time
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
one
Saturday
morning
,
as
I
be
idle
along
the
Hard
,
I
see
Karff
and
his
master
,
a
man
name
Mitchell
,
drive
in
past
the
policeman
at
the
main
gate
.
<EOS>
but
though
I
wait
for
over
three
hour
to
watch
their
exit
,
they
do
not
reappear
.
 
<EOS>
much
surprised
at
this
,
I
walk
round
to
the
Unicorn
Gate
,
at
Landport
,
where
,
on
make
judicious
inquiry
of
the
policeman
on
duty
,
I
learn
that
Mitchell
have
drive
out
--
but
alone
!
<EOS>
His
assistant
,
he
say
,
have
be
send
back
on
foot
with
a
message
through
the
main
gate
just
when
the
dockyard
man
or
"
matie
,
"
as
they
be
call
,
be
leave
work
at
midday
.
 
<EOS>
now
have
stand
at
that
gate
when
the
throng
have
pour
forth
,
I
be
quite
certain
he
have
not
emerge
.
<EOS>
but
I
keep
my
own
counsel
,
and
return
to
Southsea
,
deep
in
my
own
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
on
take
counsel
with
Ray
,
he
at
once
telephone
to
Vera
at
Admiralty
House
,
and
an
hour
later
we
all
three
discuss
the
situation
,
it
be
arrange
that
the
Admiral
's
daughter
should
contrive
to
admit
us
to
the
Dockyard
that
night
,
when
all
be
quiet
,
in
order
that
we
may
institute
a
search
for
the
miss
german
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
just
before
half
-
past
eleven
,
we
halt
before
the
small
private
door
in
the
Dockyard
wall
,
use
by
the
Admiral
-
Superintendent
and
his
household
,
and
as
the
clock
strike
the
door
open
,
reveal
Vera
.
<EOS>
next
instant
we
be
within
the
forbid
zone
.
 
<EOS>
the
night
be
frosty
and
a
good
deal
too
bright
to
suit
our
purpose
.
<EOS>
Vera
give
some
instruction
to
her
lover
,
point
to
a
row
of
long
,
dark
shed
with
slope
roof
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
Dockyard
,
say
:
 
"
if
he
be
inside
,
he
be
almost
certain
to
be
hide
somewhere
near
no
.
4
shed
.
<EOS>
but
be
careful
of
the
police
;
they
be
very
watchful
over
yonder
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
after
refastene
the
gate
she
disappear
into
the
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
deep
shadow
we
both
creep
noiselessly
forward
,
negotiate
in
safety
a
pair
of
lock
-
gate
in
the
open
,
and
pursue
our
way
until
in
the
vicinity
of
the
shed
which
the
Admiral
's
daughter
have
point
out
we
discover
an
old
boiler
,
in
which
we
both
secrete
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
hardly
have
we
creep
inside
when
we
hear
the
measure
tramp
of
a
policeman
,
who
pass
actually
within
a
few
foot
of
us
.
<EOS>
from
the
round
hole
in
which
we
lay
we
could
see
Gosport
--
a
pale
row
of
lamp
across
the
harbour
.
 
<EOS>
We
wait
there
,
scarcely
daring
to
whisper
,
until
at
last
the
clock
strike
one
.
<EOS>
if
Karff
be
in
the
vicinity
of
that
shed
beside
which
we
be
secrete
,
he
make
no
sign
.
<EOS>
all
be
silent
.
<EOS>
once
the
shrill
siren
of
a
ship
out
at
Spithead
break
the
quiet
.
<EOS>
then
its
echo
die
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
really
think
we
may
have
a
careful
look
round
,
"
Ray
suggest
after
a
long
silence
.
 
<EOS>
with
great
care
,
therefore
,
we
both
emerge
from
our
hiding
-
place
,
and
keep
well
within
the
shadow
,
pass
round
shed
no
.
4
,
which
we
find
be
completely
close
in
from
view
,
its
door
be
strongly
bar
and
padlock
.
 
<EOS>
unable
to
see
anything
,
we
decide
to
halt
in
the
darkness
behind
a
heap
of
scrap
-
iron
and
to
listen
for
any
sound
of
movement
.
 
<EOS>
the
cut
wind
chill
us
both
to
the
marrow
,
for
a
white
rime
have
gather
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
the
only
sound
we
hear
be
that
of
the
measured
footstep
of
another
constable
,
which
advance
and
then
die
away
again
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
however
,
no
sign
of
the
german
spy
.
 
<EOS>
"
to
get
in
by
the
door
yonder
would
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
he
would
try
the
roof
,
"
my
companion
remark
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
right
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
remain
down
here
and
watch
while
I
try
and
get
up
above
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
I
leave
him
,
and
after
considerable
difficulty
succeed
in
gain
the
roof
of
the
shed
adjoin
,
crouch
in
the
gutter
between
the
slope
roof
of
the
two
shed
.
 
<EOS>
on
each
side
of
me
slope
upwards
skylight
which
light
the
interior
of
the
building
-
shed
,
but
all
be
thickly
coat
with
a
composition
of
dockyard
dust
and
soot
,
which
have
be
pour
forth
from
many
a
warship
's
funnel
as
well
as
from
the
dozen
of
furnace
around
.
<EOS>
all
be
dark
below
;
therefore
I
could
see
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
in
my
elevated
position
for
fully
twenty
minute
before
I
be
prompt
to
creep
along
to
the
further
end
of
the
gulley
,
<EOS>
where
,
to
my
surprise
,
I
see
that
close
to
where
I
stand
two
pane
of
glass
have
be
neatly
remove
and
lay
aside
.
 
<EOS>
through
the
hole
I
gaze
down
into
the
interior
of
the
shed
,
when
I
be
startled
to
see
the
small
glow
of
an
electric
lamp
in
the
hand
of
the
man
of
whom
we
be
in
search
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
stand
beside
the
long
,
spindle
-
shape
hull
of
a
new
submarine
boat
which
lie
on
a
very
elevated
set
of
stock
on
the
far
side
of
the
shed
.
<EOS>
another
boat
similar
,
but
not
so
nearly
complete
,
lie
at
the
bottom
of
the
dock
alongside
her
.
 
<EOS>
as
Karff
with
his
electric
lamp
move
slowly
and
noiselessly
along
,
carefully
examine
England
's
new
submarine
,
which
rumour
have
say
be
the
most
silent
and
perfect
craft
of
its
kind
<EOS>
,
I
be
able
to
make
out
vaguely
that
,
differ
considerably
from
photograph
of
other
submarine
I
have
see
,
the
boat
on
the
elevated
stock
have
a
bow
which
run
out
into
a
kind
of
snout
,
while
instead
of
<EOS>
the
usual
small
circular
or
oval
conning
-
tower
<EOS>
she
have
what
look
like
a
long
,
narrow
superstructure
run
along
the
great
part
of
her
length
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
much
high
forward
than
aft
.
<EOS>
She
seem
,
too
,
to
have
a
great
number
of
propeller
.
 
<EOS>
I
watch
the
man
Karff
make
some
rapid
memoranda
,
and
so
occupied
be
he
with
his
work
that
he
never
look
upward
.
<EOS>
have
he
do
so
,
he
would
certainly
have
detect
my
head
against
the
sky
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
manner
which
show
him
to
be
fully
acquaint
with
the
construction
of
submarine
vessel
,
he
move
to
and
fro
,
examine
both
boat
.
<EOS>
then
,
after
about
half
an
hour
's
minute
investigation
,
he
seat
himself
upon
a
bench
and
with
his
little
lamp
shade
to
throw
no
reflection
he
take
out
a
piece
of
paper
and
leisurely
make
a
rough
sketch
of
England
's
new
war
-
craft
,
both
side
and
horizontal
view
.
 
<EOS>
leave
him
thus
occupy
,
I
descend
to
Ray
,
and
find
him
secrete
near
the
water
's
edge
,
describe
what
I
have
discover
.
 
<EOS>
"
good
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
.
"
<EOS>
so
I
be
not
mistake
in
that
cryptogram
after
all
!
<EOS>
We
will
allow
the
fellow
to
complete
his
work
and
then
compel
him
to
disgorge
his
note
.
<EOS>
They
will
furnish
us
with
very
excellent
evidence
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
we
wait
,
keep
our
eye
fix
upon
the
spot
where
he
must
descend
,
and
hardly
dare
to
breathe
lest
we
should
prematurely
alarm
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
Dockyard
clock
chime
three
,
but
the
spy
have
not
emerge
.
<EOS>
after
another
half
-
hour
of
watchful
silence
I
see
that
Ray
begin
to
be
anxious
.
<EOS>
at
last
the
bell
ring
out
four
,
and
scarcely
have
the
last
sound
die
away
when
we
be
startle
by
a
splash
near
us
,
and
next
moment
discern
a
man
in
white
shirtsleeve
swim
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
!
<EOS>
that
be
him
!
<EOS>
"
I
gasp
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
cut
a
way
out
of
the
side
of
the
shed
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
next
moment
a
boat
shoot
forth
from
the
darkness
pull
by
a
woman
who
have
apparently
be
wait
close
by
.
<EOS>
the
woman
be
Vera
!
 
<EOS>
in
a
moment
we
be
both
down
the
step
and
pull
in
the
boat
towards
the
swimming
man
,
who
,
we
see
,
be
be
rapidly
approach
by
a
second
boat
which
have
also
be
in
wait
until
the
chiming
of
the
clock
.
 
<EOS>
the
spy
be
exert
every
muscle
to
reach
the
boat
,
but
we
soon
overtook
him
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
call
upon
him
in
German
to
surrender
,
but
he
refuse
,
and
keep
on
.
<EOS>
quickly
,
however
,
we
cut
him
off
from
the
boat
which
he
be
try
to
reach
,
while
the
rower
,
see
the
discovery
of
his
friend
,
pull
away
into
the
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
for
some
time
the
spy
struggle
on
,
but
at
last
,
abandon
and
exhausted
,
he
be
compel
to
obey
us
and
come
aboard
in
order
to
save
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
half
dead
and
helpless
he
submit
to
our
search
,
<EOS>
when
in
his
belt
,
preserve
in
an
oilskin
pocket
,
we
discover
the
memorandum
and
the
drawing
which
I
have
see
him
prepare
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
,
sullen
and
half
drown
,
refuse
to
make
any
statement
,
though
he
could
speak
English
well
and
write
it
perfectly
,
as
show
by
the
note
on
his
plan
of
the
new
boat
;
therefore
we
land
him
at
the
Stony
Steps
across
at
Gosport
.
<EOS>
before
we
leave
him
we
give
him
to
understand
that
if
he
do
not
at
once
leave
the
country
he
would
be
arrest
.
<EOS>
yet
so
absurd
be
our
law
that
I
doubt
whether
we
could
have
give
him
in
charge
even
though
we
have
wish
!

<EOS>
"
this
boat
would
appear
to
me
to
be
of
about
700
ton
     
displacement
when
complete
,
possibly
rather
over
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
as
     
far
as
I
be
able
to
measure
,
about
180
foot
long
with
an
     
extreme
beam
a
little
forward
of
amidship
of
20
foot
.
<EOS>
She
be
     
fit
with
three
propeller
shaft
with
three
small
four
-
bladed
     
propeller
on
each
.
<EOS>
as
she
be
provide
with
what
appear
to
me
     
to
be
some
kind
of
turbine
engine
,
I
imagine
that
the
centre
     
shaft
be
for
go
astern
only
.
<EOS>
the
propeller
on
this
shaft
     
seem
to
be
attach
in
such
a
way
that
they
could
be
     
'
feather
'
by
suitable
gearing
on
board
so
as
not
to
retard
     
the
vessel
's
way
when
go
ahead
.
<EOS>
the
engine
of
this
boat
be
     
of
a
type
which
I
have
never
before
see
.
<EOS>
I
imagine
that
they
     
be
a
combination
of
the
new
'
gas
-
producer
'
engine
and
the
     
turbine
system
,
the
explosion
of
the
combine
gas
and
air
     
be
split
up
and
pass
into
the
turbine
through
a
number
     
of
different
channel
simultaneously
.
<EOS>
this
would
be
a
very
     
economical
system
if
the
necessary
power
can
be
obtain
,
     
and
would
be
much
safe
for
use
below
than
petrol
engine
.
      
<EOS>
"
the
boat
be
evidently
intend
to
operate
a
good
deal
in
an
     
'
awash
'
position
,
for
there
be
fairly
thick
armour
-
plating
over
     
the
great
part
of
the
upper
side
of
the
bow
,
while
the
fore
     
end
of
the
superstructure
be
make
of
two
6-inch
Krupp
steel
     
plate
meet
at
an
acute
angle
,
and
so
form
a
kind
of
stem
     
when
the
boat
be
move
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
the
space
enclose
between
     
these
two
plate
be
evidently
intend
to
be
use
as
the
     
conning
-
tower
.
<EOS>
here
there
be
a
periscope
,
steering
-
wheel
,
     
voice
-
tube
,
and
everything
necessary
for
the
control
of
the
     
vessel
.
<EOS>
there
be
two
horizontal
propeller
or
fan
,
which
seem
     
to
be
drive
by
electricity
derive
from
an
installation
of
     
accumulator
,
and
which
be
certainly
intend
to
secure
     
horizontal
immersion
,
so
the
vessel
will
not
plunge
or
dive
,
     
but
immerse
herself
horizontally
by
mean
of
these
propeller
,
     
which
,
by
the
way
,
work
in
vertical
shaft
run
completely
     
through
the
boat
,
one
forward
and
the
other
aft
,
as
be
the
     
case
in
the

_
Waddington

,
and
other
early
     
submarine

<EOS>
Forward
there
be
an
air
-
lock

diving

chamber
,
as
in
the
     
'

,
so
that
diver
can
get
in

out
of
the

<EOS>
whilst
under

.
<EOS>
It
would
also
afford
a
means
of

for
     
the

in
the

<EOS>
this
be
further
provide

of
the

capable
of
hold
ten
man
,
I
should
say
,
or
     
possibly
a
dozen
.
<EOS>
there
be
also
appliance
which
I
suppose
be
     
telephone
buoy
for
communicate
with
the
surface

<EOS>
there
be
     
six
torpedo
tube
fit
,
one
forward
,
one
aft
,
and
the
other
     
two
on
either
broadside
.
<EOS>
and
there
seem
to
be
provision
for
     
six
other
torpedo
of
the
18-inch
type
.
      
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
long
rudder
for
ordinary
steering
,
and
four
     
horizontal
one
or
plane
which
be
place
abreast
the
     
horizontal
screw
and
which
,
I
imagine
,
act
automatically
in
     
conjunction
with
them
,
as
they
seem
to
gear
up
with
the
shafts
     
for
these
propeller
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
big
safety
detachable
weight
     
which
fit
loosely
into
a
recess
amidship
,
and
four
broad
     
wheel
with
ball
bearing
which
do
not
fold
up
as
in
the
'
Lake
'
     
boat
,
but
always
protrude
nearly
half
their
diameter
.
<EOS>
after
     
all
they
would
not
obstruct
her
way
when
water
-
bear
more
than
     
a
keel
--
or
very
little
more
.
<EOS>
They
be
quite
independent
and
     
unconnecte
with
the
interior
of
the
vessel
,
which
while
     
rest
on
them
would
receive
forward
impetus
from
her
     
propeller
.
<EOS>
in
the
'
awash

position
she
would
offer
a
very
     
small
and
almost
invulnerable
target
.

I

marvel

"
he
reply
;
"
but
at
last
I
decipher
them
as
'
F.
2'--f
be
the
sixth
letter
of
the
alphabet
--
the
number
of
our
new
and
most
formidable
submarine
,
which
be
be
keep
such
a
strict
secret
by
the
Admiralty
.
'
<EOS>
Royal
Pier
'
be
the
name
of
the
hotel
in
which
Steinheim
stay
at
Southsea
,
and
18
<EOS>
the
number
of
his
room
.
<EOS>
from
fact
I
elucidate
,
it
be
make
plain
that
Max
Steinheim
be
about
to
embark
upon
the
investigation
,
be
in
secret
communication
with
Hartmann
,
and
be
to
meet
Karff
at
Charing
Cross
Station
.
<EOS>
this
Steinheim
have
already
,
by
an
ingenious
device
,
secure
from
a
private
of
engineer
name
James
Ward
--
whom
I
have
see
--
certain
information
regard
the
new
boom
defence
of
Portsmouth
Harbour
.
<EOS>
Ward
,
whose
home
be
at
Great
Weldon
,
suddenly
discover
to
his
horror
that
the
man
be
a
german
spy
,
follow
him
to
Guildford
,
attack
him
in
the
train
,
and
leave
him
for
dead
.
<EOS>
for
that
reason
Steinheim
have
refuse
to
make
any
statement
to
the
police
.
<EOS>
when
I
see
Ward
a
week
ago
,
he
explain
how
innocently
he
have
fall
into
the
trap
which
the
cunne
Steinheim
have
lay
for
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
evidence
you
have
here
in
black
and
white
will
surely
prove
convincing
,
"
I
remark
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
go
and
see
Steinheim
again
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
He
be
still
in
the
hospital
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
We
shall
remain
silent
.
<EOS>
to
show
our
hand
will
only
place
Hartmann
on
the
alert
.
<EOS>
to
do
that
be
needless
.
<EOS>
We
have
prevent
the
plan
of
our
new
submarine
go
to
Germany
,
and
for
the
present
that
be
sufficient
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
my
friend
draw
up
the
blind
and
gaze
out
upon
the
rosy
dawn
across
the
water

<EOS>
all
yesterday

<EOS>
I

very
seriously

<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
suppose
they
treat
the
whole
thing
lightly
,
as
they
always
do

<EOS>
We
invite
invasion

"
he
sigh
as
he
rise
,
add
:
"
let
's
turn
in
now
.
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
we
will
keep
an
eye
upon
that
unusually
inquisitive

<EOS>
that
night
the
eye
of
the
german
maid
haunt
me
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
rid
myself
of
their
recollection

<EOS>
be
it
that
this
hunting
down
of
german
spy
be
get
on
my
nerve

<EOS>
next
day
we
be
shoot
Starlings
Wood
,
about
five
mile
distant
,
but
Ray
have
"
cry
off
"
one
day
,
could
not
do
so
again
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
at
his
suggestion
,
I
make
an
excuse
and
remain
at
home
with
the
lady
.
<EOS>
the
morning
I
spend
walk
through
the
park
with
Vera
,
a
smart
,
sweet
-
faced
little
figure
in
her
short
tweed
skirt
and
fur
,
with
her
bright
and
vivacious
chatter
.
<EOS>
from
her
I
learn
some
further
detail
concern
her
visit
to
Emden
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ray
be
most
excited
about
it
,
Mr.
Jacox
,
"
she
be
say
.
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
I
have
to
make
my
inquiry
with
great
caution
and
discretion
,
but
I
manage
to
find
out
what
I
want
,
and
I
send
all
the
detail
to
the
Admiralty
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
 
then
as
we
go
along
the
wide
beech
avenue
I
tell
her
of
the
curious
incident
in
the
smoking
-
room
on
the
previous
evening
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ray
be
tell
me
about
it
just
before
breakfast
,
"
she
say
,
turn
her
splendid
eye
to
mine
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
make
some
inquiry
of
Mrs.
Hill
-
Mason
,
and
it
appear
that
the
maid
Erna
Stolberg
be
recommend
to
her
by
a
friend
when
she
be
in
Dresden
last
year
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
most
exemplary
person
,
and
have
a
number
of
friend
in
England

<EOS>
She
be
previously
with
a
French
_
baronne

"
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Hill
-
Mason
often
move
in
a
military
set
,
do
not
she
?
<EOS>
"
I
remark
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
somebody
last
night
state
that
she
be
the
widow
of
a
general
,
and
be
well
know
down
at
Aldershot
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
Mrs.
Hill
-
Mason
visit
at
the
house
of
military
officer
,
as
it
seem
she
do
,
then
this
inquisitive
maid
would
be
afford
many
opportunity
for
gather
information
.
<EOS>
I
intend
to
watch
her
,
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
so
will
I
,
Mr.
Jacox
,
"
reply
the
admiral
's
daughter
,
draw
her
astrachan
collar
tight
about
her
throat
.
 
<EOS>
half
an
hour
later
we
drive
in
the
wagonette
out
to
the
shooting
-
party
in
the
wood
,
where
a
merry
luncheon
be
serve
in
a
marquee
.
<EOS>
I
,
however
,
return
to
the
house
before
the
rest
of
the
party
and
haunt
the
servant
'
hall
.
<EOS>
with
Williams
the
butler
I
be
on
friendly
term
,
and
find
him
in
the
great
hall
,
begin
to
make
inquiry
regard
the
guest
'
servant
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
get
a
german
woman
among
them
,
have
not
you
?
<EOS>
"
I
remark
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
"
be
his
reply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
rather
funny
one
she
be
,
<EOS>
I
fancy
.
<EOS>
She
go
out
alone
for
walk
after
she
be
dress
her
mistress
for
dinner
,
and
be
out
sometimes
till
quite
late
.
<EOS>
what
she
do
wander
about
in
the
dark
nobody
know
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
for
me
to
say
a
word
,
sir
<EOS>
;
she
be
a
visitor
's
maid
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
hold
my
own
counsel
,
but
resolve
to
watch
.
 
<EOS>
tea
in
the
great
hall
,
over
which
Lady
Jocelyn
preside
,
prove
the
usual
irresponsible
function
,
but
when
I
go
to
my
room
to
dress
for
dinner
<EOS>
I
become
convinced
that
certain
paper
in
my
suit
-
case
have
be
turn
over
and
investigate
.
 
<EOS>
that
night
I
do
not
go
in
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
I
hear
the
gong
sound
,
and
when
the
company
have
go
in
,
I
put
on
thick
boot
,
overcoat
,
and
cap
,
and
pass
through
the
back
way
along
the
old
wing
of
the
house
,
through
the
smoking
-
room
,
and
out
upon
the
drive
.
 
<EOS>
behind
some
holly
bush
where
I
could
see
any
one
leave
by
the
great
paved
courtyard
where
the
servant
'
entrance
be
situate
,
I
conceal
myself
and
wait
in
patience
.
<EOS>
the
night
be
dark
and
overcast
.
<EOS>
the
stable
chime
have
ring
out
half
-
past
eight
,
but
I
still
remain
until
,
about
twenty
minute
later
,
footfall
sound
,
and
from
out
the
arched
entrance
to
the
courtyard
come
a
female
figure
in
a
close
-
fitting
hat
and
long
dark
ulster
.
 
<EOS>
She
pass
close
by
me
,
under
the
light
of
the
lamp
,
and
I
see
it
be
the
fair
-
haired
woman
for
whom
I
be
wait
.
 
<EOS>
instead
of
walk
straight
down
the
avenue
to
the
lodge
-
gate
,
she
strike
along
a
footpath
which
lead
for
a
mile
across
the
park
,
first
skirt
the
lake
--
the
fishpond
of
the
monk
who
live
there
before
the
Dissolution
;
then
,
pass
under
the
dark
shadow
of
a
spinney
,
lead
to
a
stile
by
which
the
high
park
wall
could
be
negotiate
and
the
main
road
to
East
Dereham
reach
.
 
<EOS>
as
she
go
forward
so
I
follow
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
path
well
.
<EOS>
I
watch
her
ascend
the
stile
and
cross
the
wall
into
the
road
.
<EOS>
then
I
creep
up
and
peer
over
into
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
She
have
turn
to
the
right
,
and
I
could
discern
her
waiting
at
the
roadside
about
thirty
yard
away
.
 
<EOS>
from
my
place
of
concealment
<EOS>
I
could
hear
her
slow
footstep
as
she
idle
up
and
down
in
the
darkness
,
evidently
wait
for
some
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
about
ten
minute
pass
when
I
hear
the
whir
of
a
motor
-
car
approaching
,
<EOS>
its
big
glaring
headlamp
shed
a
stream
of
white
brilliance
over
the
muddy
road
.
<EOS>
as
it
approach
her
it
slow
down
and
stop
.
<EOS>
then
I
distinguish
it
to
be
a
big
Limousine
,
the
occupant
of
which
open
the
door
,
and
she
enter
with
a
word
of
greeting
.
 
<EOS>
I
stand
peer
into
the
darkness
,
in
surprise
and
disappointment
at
not
catch
sight
of
the
person
with
whom
she
be
keep
these
nightly
appointment
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
door
have
bang
the
driver
drive
across
the
road
,
back
,
and
turn
,
speed
away
in
the
direction
he
have
come
.
 
<EOS>
but
while
he
be
turn
I
have
gain
the
road
,
advance
beneath
the
hedgerow
in
an
endeavour
to
see
the
number
of
the
car
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
baffle
.
<EOS>
It
be
cover
with
mud
.
 
<EOS>
afterwards
,
much
disappointed
,
and
certainly
hungry
,
I
make
my
way
back
across
the
park
to
the
Hall
,
where
,
after
manage
to
get
a
snack
from
Williams
,
I
join
the
party
at
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
that
night
the
woman
Stolberg
return
at
five
minute
to
eleven
,
and
later
,
when
Ray
go
upstairs
with
me
,
I
describe
what
I
have
see
.
 
<EOS>
next
night
,
instead
of
follow
her
out
,
I
wait
at
the
spot
at
half
-
past
ten
,
when
,
sure
enough
,
the
car
return
ten
minute
later
and
deposit
her
.
<EOS>
the
number
plate
,
however
,
be
obliterate
by
the
mud
both
front
and
back
--
purposely
it
seem
to
me
.
<EOS>
the
man
within
shake
her
hand
as
she
alight
,
but
I
could
not
see
his
face
.
<EOS>
be
he
some
secret
lover
?
<EOS>
apparently
she
go
no
great
distance
each
evening
,
go
and
come
from
the
direction
of
Holt
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
follow
day
I
take
several
opportunity
of
watch
the
woman
at
close
quarter
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
be
peculiarly
set
,
very
close
together
,
her
lip
be
thin
,
and
her
cheek
-
bone
rather
high
.
<EOS>
otherwise
she
be
not
bad
-
looking
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Hill
-
Mason
have
,
of
course
,
no
idea
of
her
maid
's
nocturnal
motor
-
ride
.
 
<EOS>
whether
the
woman
have
any
suspicion
that
she
be
be
watch
I
know
not
;
but
on
the
next
night
when
Ray
take
a
turn
at
keep
an
eye
upon
her
,
she
do
not
go
out
,
but
on
the
next
she
go
,
and
Ray
follow
her
to
the
park
wall
,
but
see
nothing
more
than
I
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
time
,
of
course
,
Vera
be
greatly
interested
in
the
result
of
our
observation
.
<EOS>
through
her
own
maid
,
Batson
,
she
discover
the
room
occupy
by
the
german
,
and
to
this
I
make
my
way
,
at
considerable
risk
,
one
morning
while
the
maid
be
busy
attend
upon
her
mistress
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
good
look
through
her
belonging
,
find
in
her
trunk
a
small
,
flat
tin
box
,
japan
dark
green
,
strong
,
and
secure
by
a
lock
of
well
-
know
make
.
<EOS>
what
,
I
wonder
,
do
it
contain
?
 
<EOS>
Could
I
have
but
see
the
number
of
the
mysterious
car
<EOS>
I
could
have
discover
the
identity
of
her
nocturnal
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
the
same
day
that
I
discover
the
tin
box
in
her
trunk
,
Mrs.
Hill
-
Mason
,
however
,
return
to
London
,
take
with
her
the
mysterious
Fraeulein
.
 
<EOS>
three
day
more
go
by
,
and
I
be
about
to
dismiss
the
affair
as
a
combination
of
curious
circumstance
.
<EOS>
Vera
and
her
aunt
have
leave
to
pay
a
visit
in
Worcestershire
,
and
Ray
<EOS>
I
be
due
to
go
up
to
town
that
morning
,
when
he
enter
my
room
,
say
abruptly
:
 
"
I
be
not
go
to
London
yet
,
Jack
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
over
to
Cromer
instead
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Cromer
!
<EOS>
"
I
echo
.
<EOS>
"
hardly
the
time
of
year
for
the
seaside
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
that
same
grey
chilly
afternoon
,
in
the
grey
fall
light
,
we
sit
upon
one
of
the
seat
of
the
pier
at
Cromer
gaze
seaward
,
towards
where
the
german
coast
lie
beyond
the
indistinct
horizon
.
<EOS>
the
place
be
desert
save
for
ourselves
.
<EOS>
on
the
cliff
behind
us
stand
the
long
red
facade
and
many
gable
of
the
Hotel
de
Paris
,
where
we
have
put
up
,
while
in
the
background
rise
the
square
old
church
tower
,
the
landmark
of
mariner
from
Haisborough
Gat
to
the
Dowsing
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
just
a
chance
of
us
fall
upon
something
interesting
about
here
,
"
Ray
be
say
,
as
he
press
the
tobacco
into
his
pipe
,
and
by
the
expression
upon
his
keen
clean
-
shaven
face
I
see
that
he
have
scent
the
presence
of
spy
.
"
<EOS>
have
it
never
strike
you
,
"
he
go
on
,
"
that
the
east
coast
,
where
we
now
be
be
the
most
vulnerable
spot
in
England
,
and
the
first
objective
of
the
Kaiser
's
army
?
<EOS>
every
soldier
and
sailor
in
Germany
dream
of
'
the
day'--the
day
when
he
will
set
foot
upon
this
shore
.
<EOS>
for
some
year
past
our
Intelligence
Department
have
know
of
the
german
plan
for
our
invasion
.
<EOS>
there
be
several
,
but
in
each
one
a
dash
,
and
a
surprise
landing
along
this
coast
of
Norfolk
and
of
Suffolk
and
Essex
be
the
first
step
.
<EOS>
knowledge
of
this
prompt
Lord
Roberts
to
resign
his
seat
on
the
National
Defence
Committee
and
make
those
stirring
speech
point
out
our
country
's
peril
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
what
thank
do
the
country
give
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
interrupt
.
<EOS>
"
People
only
laugh
at
him
for
his
trouble
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
my
friend
bitterly
,
"
the
public
be
ignorant
,
therefore
they
do
not
heed
.
<EOS>
They
talk
glibly
about
the
strength
of
our
navy
,
forgetful
that
the
german
diplomacy
be
the
clever
and
most
cunning
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
when
'
the
day
'
dawn
there
will
be
no
suspicion
of
war
,
and
certainly
no
declaration
of
hostility
.
<EOS>
before
we
have
realise
that
war
be
in
the
air
,
the
enemy
will
have
their
foot
firmly
plant
upon
british
soil
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
if
the
enemy
intend
land
along
this
shore
,
it
be
certain
that
spy
be
active
here
,
gather
all
information
likely
to
be
of
service
to
the
invader
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
exactly
why
I
have
come
here
,
my
dear
Jack
,
"
my
friend
say
.
<EOS>
"
We
know
that
our
eastern
county
have
be
divide
into
district
by
the
Germans
,
and
in
each
one
or
more
secret
agent
be
busily
at
work
take
note
of
food
supply
,
forage
,
blacksmith
'
shop
,
motor
-
car
for
transport
,
the
destruction
of
telegraph
and
telephone
,
position
for
artillery
,
and
the
good
mode
of
advance
south
to
London
.
<EOS>
one
may
rest
assure
that
the
ordnance
map
be
be
very
much
amplify
just
now
.
"
 
<EOS>
that
evening
we
spend
idly
in
the
hotel
,
and
next
day
,
hire
a
motor
-
car
<EOS>
,
we
drive
through
Runton
to
Sheringham
and
over
the
hill
three
mile
further
towards
the
back
-
door
of
England
--
<EOS>
the
place
neglect
by
those
responsible
for
our
defence
,
and
by
the
public
alike
--
Weybourne
.
 
<EOS>
the
road
from
Sheringham
run
down
a
steep
hill
,
call
the
Fox
Hill
,
to
the
little
village
that
lie
cosily
at
some
distance
from
the
sea
.
<EOS>
pass
the
church
we
turn
sharply
to
the
right
,
and
in
a
few
minute
find
ourselves
against
a
large
front
with
a
wide
open
beach
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
have
alight
,
we
walk
along
beside
the
surf
for
some
distance
,
out
of
hearing
of
our
chauffeur
,
when
my
friend
exclaim
:
 
<EOS>
"
here
be
one
of
the
spot
which
the
Germans
have
choose
for
landing
.
<EOS>
look
at
it
!
<EOS>
everything
be
in
favour
of
a
hostile
force
.
<EOS>
that
range
of
hill
we
have
just
come
over
at
the
back
would
be
occupy
by
the
landing
force
at
once
,
and
thus
they
would
command
the
whole
country
from
Kelling
,
which
you
see
to
the
right
,
away
south
beyond
Cromer
,
down
to
Baxton
beyond
Mundesley
.
"
 
<EOS>
with
my
back
to
the
long
roll
breaker
I
gaze
away
landward
at
the
long
line
of
hill
stretch
in
each
direction
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
indeed
,
an
ideal
spot
for
an
enemy
to
effect
a
landing
,
with
deep
water
right
up
to
the
land
.
 
<EOS>
"
because
of
the
confidence
we
have
in
our
fleet
and
our
wonderful
diplomacy
<EOS>
this
place
be
no
longer
watch
,
"
Raymond
remark
,
stand
beside
me
muffle
in
his
motor
-
coat
,
for
the
wind
be
intensely
cold
.
"
<EOS>
yet
in
day
go
by
,
by
reason
of
the
facility
which
nature
have
provide
for
the
landing
of
hostile
force
,
it
be
carefully
guard
whenever
the
invasion
of
England
be
believe
to
be
imminent
.
"
 
<EOS>
after
we
have
stroll
some
distance
along
the
beach
,
where
the
grey
-
green
water
be
break
into
foam
,
my
friend
suddenly
halt
and
,
take
a
piece
of
paper
from
his
pocket
,
stand
with
his
back
to
the
sea
and
make
a
sketch
of
the
irregular
contour
of
the
blue
hill
face
him
from
the
coastguard
at
Salthouse
on
the
right
to
the
rise
ground
behind
Upper
Sheringham
on
the
left
--
the
position
which
be
to
be
first
occupy
by
the
enemy
in
their
attack
upon
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
no
explanation
of
the
reason
of
his
action
,
therefore
I
stand
by
watch
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
we
return
to
the
car
and
drive
inland
to
Weybourne
village
,
a
sleepy
old
-
world
little
place
from
which
the
sea
have
recede
.
<EOS>
as
we
turn
into
the
main
road
he
order
the
man
to
pull
up
,
and
,
descending
,
look
about
him
,
first
at
the
line
of
telegraph
-
wire
run
beside
the
road
,
and
then
we
both
stroll
through
the
village
.
<EOS>
My
companion
's
eye
be
everywhere
.
<EOS>
He
appear
to
be
make
mental
note
of
every
feature
of
the
obscure
little
place
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
we
be
return
to
the
car
he
suddenly
halt
,
say
:
 
"
You
go
on
.
<EOS>
a
thought
have
just
occur
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
and
,
turn
,
he
walk
back
to
the
small
village
post
office
situate
next
door
to
an
inn
,
and
be
absent
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
I
suspect
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
remark
beneath
his
breath
as
he
rejoin
me
.
"
<EOS>
that
inn
be
keep
by
a
German
!
"
 
<EOS>
then
we
travel
along
to
Cley
-
next
-
the
-
Sea
,
and
thence
by
way
of
Candlestick
Hill
and
through
the
wooded
country
around
Holt
,
back
to
Sheringham
,
where
we
lunch
at
the
"
Burlington
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
manner
have
change
.
<EOS>
He
have
again
become
serious
and
thoughtful
.
<EOS>
a
cycling
map
of
the
district
which
he
have
buy
in
Cromer
that
morning
he
bring
out
,
and
as
we
sit
together
in
the
smoking
-
room
he
spread
it
upon
the
table
and
begin
measure
distance
with
a
slip
of
fold
paper
.
 
<EOS>
the
car
be
at
the
door
at
four
o'clock
,
and
we
be
in
the
act
of
move
off
,
when
by
mere
chance
I
look
up
at
the
second
floor
of
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
what
I
see
cause
me
to
hold
my
breath
.
 
<EOS>
a
face
be
at
one
of
the
window
watch
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
nudge
my
friend
,
and
cry
,
"
look
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
when
he
raise
his
head
it
have
go
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
white
face
have
only
show
there
for
a
single
instant
,
yet
it
be
a
countenance
that
I
too
well
remember
,
it
be
unmistakable
--
<EOS>
that
of
Fraeulein
Stolberg
!
 
<EOS>
I
tell
Ray
as
we
whirl
along
into
the
town
.
<EOS>
but
he
only
grunt
in
surprise
,
and
remark
that
we
be
go
to
Beccles
.
 
<EOS>
why
be
that
woman
there
instead
of
be
with
her
mistress
,
who
,
we
have
ascertain
,
be
now
visit
at
Cheltenham
?
 
<EOS>
Our
way
lie
first
back
to
Cromer
,
where
we
join
the
direct
Norwich
road
by
way
of
Aylsham
,
but
about
four
mile
after
pass
Cromer
the
road
divide
.
<EOS>
the
left
-
hand
one
run
to
our
destination
,
but
at
Ray
's
order
we
take
the
right
-
hand
one
,
and
in
the
darkening
twilight
strike
across
a
wide
heath
,
which
I
afterwards
learnt
be
call
Roughton
Heath
,
until
we
pass
an
old
windmill
,
and
enter
the
small
crooked
village
of
Roughton
.
<EOS>
We
pass
beyond
the
place
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
and
then
descend
,
walk
forward
until
we
come
to
a
good
-
sized
,
comfortable
,
old
-
fashioned
house
,
probably
of
the
day
of
Queen
Anne
,
that
lie
behind
a
high
red
-
brick
wall
.
 
<EOS>
through
the
iron
gate
I
notice
,
as
we
pause
,
a
wide
lawn
in
front
,
with
step
lead
up
to
a
portico
,
and
behind
a
large
orchard
and
meadow
.
<EOS>
the
blind
be
already
down
,
but
in
several
of
the
window
light
show
,
and
the
place
look
well
keep
up
.
 
<EOS>
It
differ
but
little
from
hundred
of
other
old
-
fashioned
house
in
the
country
,
but
it
evidently
hold
considerable
attraction
for
Ray
,
because
as
we
pass
beyond
the
gate
,
and
out
of
sight
of
any
one
in
the
house
,
he
take
out
his
electric
torch
and
carefully
examine
the
muddy
roadway
.
 
<EOS>
"
see
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
,
point
to
track
that
run
in
and
out
of
the
gateway
.
<EOS>
"
the
car
's
home
be
here
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
car
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
car
which
use
to
meet
the
german
maid
at
Metfield
,
"
be
his
matter
-
of
-
fact
reply
.
<EOS>
"
for
the
present
we
know
sufficient
.
<EOS>
We
must
look
sharp
if
we
be
to
be
in
beccle
before
eight
.
<EOS>
if
we
be
not
there
before
,
it
will
be
of
no
use
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
we
hurry
back
to
our
own
car
,
and
our
driver
,
by
take
a
by
-
path
,
bring
us
out
upon
the
main
road
again
at
Thorpe
Market
,
and
just
after
half
-
past
seven
we
pull
up
before
the
hotel
in
the
old
Suffolk
market
town
of
Beccles
,
under
the
shadow
of
the
stumpy
square
old
church
tower
.
 
<EOS>
the
car
be
garage
,
and
after
a
drink
we
go
forth
for
a
walk
along
the
quiet
old
-
world
street
,
until
suddenly
upon
a
corner
we
come
to
the
post
office
,
a
large
old
-
fashioned
two
-
storied
house
with
steep
tile
roof
.
 
<EOS>
"
wait
about
here
<EOS>
,
"
my
companion
say
;
"
a
dark
-
haired
man
in
a
light
grey
overcoat
and
golf
-
cap
will
probably
come
to
post
a
letter
just
before
eight
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
dark
brown
beard
,
and
usually
wear
a
white
muffler
.
<EOS>
when
he
come
follow
him
,
and
see
where
he
go
.
<EOS>
He
may
know
me
,
so
I
must
keep
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
therefore
I
light
my
pipe
,
and
idle
up
and
down
,
keep
the
letter
-
box
in
view
.
<EOS>
in
the
window
,
directly
above
it
,
be
a
clock
which
show
it
then
to
be
a
quarter
to
eight
.
<EOS>
I
take
a
pretended
interest
in
the
small
shop
near
,
until
about
four
minute
to
the
hour
<EOS>
a
closed
motor
-
car
swing
round
from
the
direction
of
the
Public
Hail
,
and
pull
up
before
the
post
office
.
 
<EOS>
from
it
two
man
alight
--
one
a
youngish
fair
-
haired
man
,
and
the
other
,
dark
-
bearded
and
much
old
,
wear
a
thick
grey
overcoat
and
a
white
muffler
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
man
of
whom
I
be
in
search
.
 
<EOS>
I
enter
the
office
directly
after
the
pair
,
on
pretence
of
buy
stamp
,
but
already
the
elder
of
the
two
have
hand
in
a
letter
to
be
register
,
the
address
of
which
I
fail
to
discern
.
 
<EOS>
both
seem
to
be
in
a
great
hurry
,
for
as
soon
as
the
receipt
be
write
out
they
re
-
enter
the
car
and
drive
back
in
the
direction
they
have
come
,
leave
me
stand
helpless
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
immediately
I
return
to
the
hotel
where
Ray
be
wait
,
and
report
to
him
,
whereupon
he
seize
his
hat
,
and
walk
with
me
back
to
the
post
office
halt
in
the
centre
of
the
road
examine
the
wheel
-
track
,
which
be
still
quite
plain
upon
the
damp
roadway
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
as
he
walk
back
,
he
say
:
 
"
do
you
know
,
Jack
,
that
this
town
beccle
have
be
decide
upon
by
the
Germans
as
the
head
-
quarter
of
the
Army
Corps
which
land
at
Weybourne
?
<EOS>
It
be
a
natural
position
,
stand
upon
high
ground
and
command
the
whole
of
the
surround
country
.
<EOS>
signal
make
from
that
church
tower
yonder
could
be
see
very
far
afield
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
,
as
we
sit
together
in
the
coffee
-
room
of
the
hotel
,
eat
a
hasty
meal
,
he
remark
:
 
"
We
will
go
back
to
Cromer
to
-
night
,
but
I
shall
go
to
town
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
You
will
wait
till
my
return
,
will
not
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
so
I
be
leave
alone
for
nearly
a
week
;
and
on
his
return
he
announce
that
we
must
at
once
shift
our
quarter
to
Lowestoft
.
<EOS>
so
south
we
go
that
same
night
,
arrive
at
midnight
,
and
put
up
at
the
many
-
balconie
Empire
Hotel
.
 
<EOS>
the
town
interest
my
companion
not
at
all
,
but
from
there
we
go
forth
each
day
on
long
motor
excursion
,
scour
the
whole
country
as
far
south
as
Aldborough
and
as
far
west
as
Bury
St.
Edmunds
.
<EOS>
all
the
road
round
Southwold
,
Bungay
,
Saxmundham
,
Stow
Market
,
and
many
other
town
we
reconnoitre
,
apparently
always
with
the
same
object
--
to
discover
wheel
-
track
of
a
mysterious
car
.
 
<EOS>
the
garage
of
every
town
Ray
visit
alone
,
but
his
inquiry
always
meet
with
the
same
negative
result
.
 
<EOS>
late
one
afternoon
,
however
,
when
on
the
road
between
Wymondham
and
Diss
,
he
suddenly
shout
to
the
driver
to
stop
,
and
jump
out
,
examine
the
track
of
wheel
.
<EOS>
the
road
,
however
,
be
hard
at
that
spot
,
and
it
be
some
time
before
he
could
decide
whether
the
car
have
travel
north
or
south
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
have
go
north
!
"
<EOS>
he
declare
with
satisfaction
;
therefore
we
continue
to
follow
them
towards
Wymondham
,
where
they
have
draw
up
at
the
"
Old
Green
Dragon
,
"
and
go
forth
again
,
strike
into
a
by
-
road
which
lead
to
Bracon
Ash
.
 
<EOS>
"
ha
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
,
when
he
see
this
,
"
so
they
be
busy
at
work
<EOS>
--
that
be
plain
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
by
this
time
the
light
have
fade
,
and
much
to
our
chagrin
we
be
again
compel
to
give
up
the
hunt
,
and
find
our
way
over
by
Hempnall
,
and
so
through
Bungay
back
to
Lowestoft
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
we
be
early
back
again
at
the
spot
,
but
heavy
rain
have
unfortunately
fall
all
night
,
so
the
track
have
be
obliterate
.
 
<EOS>
after
another
week
of
unsuccessful
journeying
we
be
,
one
day
,
about
half
-
way
between
Norwich
go
towards
Aylsham
,
when
my
friend
's
keen
eye
catch
sight
of
a
wheel
-
track
come
out
of
a
narrow
by
-
road
.
 
<EOS>
We
halt
,
and
descend
<EOS>
he
examine
them
minutely
,
declare
that
they
be
what
we
be
in
search
of
,
and
quite
fresh
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
considerably
excited
,
we
be
soon
upon
the
trail
,
follow
the
car
through
Aylsham
and
North
Walsham
until
,
on
the
road
that
lead
towards
the
sea
at
Happisburgh
,
it
suddenly
turn
into
another
byway
.
 
<EOS>
here
Ray
decide
to
pull
up
and
follow
on
foot
,
which
we
do
for
nearly
two
mile
,
until
we
see
before
us
the
railway
line
which
run
between
North
Walsham
and
Yarmouth
.
<EOS>
We
have
leave
the
road
,
for
there
,
pull
up
before
us
,
be
the
car
I
have
see
at
Beccles
,
and
on
ahead
be
the
two
man
,
one
of
whom
I
recognise
by
his
grey
coat
and
white
muffler
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
beneath
the
railway
bridge
,
carefully
examine
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
be
mark
that
down
on
their
plan
for
destruction
,
"
remark
Ray
between
his
tooth
.
<EOS>
"
all
these
connection
will
be
destroy
when
they
land
.
<EOS>
but
,
by
heaven
!
<EOS>
we
will
be
even
with
them
yet
!
"
 
<EOS>
We
watch
them
in
secret
for
a
full
half
-
hour
,
as
they
examine
the
railroad
at
several
point
,
and
when
they
have
drive
off
we
follow
them
along
a
road
where
run
six
line
of
telegraph
into
Happisburgh
.
 
<EOS>
"
those
wire
,
"
remark
Ray
,
"
form
one
of
the
direct
cable
to
Germany
.
<EOS>
They
pass
through
beccle
,
so
you
may
rest
assure
that
they
have
survey
it
well
!
"
 
<EOS>
at
Happisburgh
the
track
turn
to
the
left
,
and
thence
again
to
the
right
to
Walcot
,
but
just
as
we
be
pass
over
a
low
hill
we
see
that
the
car
on
before
us
have
stop
.
<EOS>
the
two
man
be
photograph
the
country
from
Paston
,
inland
towards
Witton
.
 
<EOS>
We
draw
up
and
watch
their
movement
.
 
<EOS>
then
they
go
on
,
and
we
follow
,
part
company
with
their
track
at
the
cross
-
road
,
they
go
westward
,
while
we
strike
north
,
until
we
find
ourselves
once
again
in
Cromer
for
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
that
evening
we
make
an
amazing
discovery
at
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
Erna
Stolberg
be
stay
there
alone
under
the
name
of
Madame
Hirsch
!
<EOS>
Ray
first
see
her
seat
in
the
reading
-
room
,
and
call
me
.
<EOS>
I
peer
in
at
the
door
and
recognise
her
in
a
pale
blue
silk
blouse
and
black
net
skirt
,
lie
back
in
a
chair
read
an
illustrate
paper
.
<EOS>
She
be
evidently
quite
unsuspicious
of
our
presence
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
be
sorely
puzzle
.
<EOS>
next
morning
he
send
a
wire
to
Mrs.
Hill
-
Mason
's
house
in
Charles
Street
,
and
before
noon
have
receive
a
reply
from
her
at
Bournemouth
say
that
Fraeulein
Stolberg
have
leave
her
service
a
fortnight
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
german
spy
be
pretty
active
in
East
Anglia
,
old
chap
,
as
you
have
see
with
your
own
eye
,
"
he
remark
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
in
order
that
the
woman
should
not
notice
us
,
we
tell
the
chauffeur
to
meet
us
out
on
the
Norwich
road
,
after
which
we
travel
to
quaint
old
Aylsham
,
where
we
idle
away
the
day
,
spend
the
afternoon
play
billiard
at
the
"
White
Horse
.
"
 
<EOS>
More
than
once
during
the
day
my
companion
examine
the
road
outside
for
trace
of
wheel
-
track
,
but
there
be
none
like
those
of
the
car
of
those
secret
agent
of
Hermann
Hartmann
.
 
<EOS>
I
notice
that
Ray
have
bring
with
him
a
small
brown
brief
-
bag
,
an
unusual
thing
for
him
to
carry
.
<EOS>
but
that
morning
he
have
place
it
in
the
car
with
instruction
to
the
chauffeur
to
move
it
on
no
account
.
 
<EOS>
at
four
o'clock
that
afternoon
he
receive
a
telegram
,
which
he
read
through
twice
,
and
place
on
the
fire
,
remark
:
 
"
from
Vera
.
<EOS>
She
be
receive
the
thank
of
the
Admiralty
for
her
report
.
<EOS>
They
promise
to
make
inquiry
.
<EOS>
probably
they
will
send
somebody
over
who
can
not
speak
a
word
of
German
!
"
 
<EOS>
We
dine
at
half
-
past
six
off
cold
meat
and
pickle
,
but
not
until
midnight
do
we
set
out
upon
the
road
,
travel
north
in
the
direction
of
Cromer
,
until
we
come
to
the
cross
road
at
Hanworth
,
where
we
halt
and
Ray
get
down
to
examine
the
road
.
<EOS>
wheel
-
track
be
there
lead
back
to
Roughton
,
and
these
we
follow
until
,
near
the
entrance
to
the
village
,
now
in
complete
darkness
,
we
descend
,
<EOS>
Ray
lift
out
his
precious
bag
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
get
your
revolver
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
when
we
have
go
a
hundred
yard
or
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
reply
in
the
affirmative
,
for
nowadays
I
always
carry
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
we
be
go
to
get
into
that
house
at
Roughton
<EOS>
I
point
out
to
you
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
intend
to
have
a
look
round
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
mean
to
break
in
?
<EOS>
suppose
we
be
catch
!
"
<EOS>
I
exclaim
.
 
<EOS>
"
bah
!
<EOS>
spy
be
always
coward
.
<EOS>
leave
that
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
we
go
on
until
,
have
pass
through
the
silent
village
,
we
enter
a
road
where
the
bare
tree
meet
overhead
,
render
it
almost
pitch
-
dark
,
and
presently
approach
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
not
a
light
show
anywhere
.
<EOS>
whoever
be
its
occupant
,
they
have
retire
.
 
<EOS>
for
nearly
half
an
hour
we
conceal
ourselves
in
the
bush
opposite
,
watch
in
patience
,
for
the
night
be
as
yet
young
.
<EOS>
in
the
distance
we
fancy
we
hear
the
sound
of
wheel
,
but
they
do
not
advance
;
therefore
we
agree
that
it
be
only
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
after
wait
what
seem
to
me
hour
,
Ray
switch
on
his
electric
lamp
to
see
the
time
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
nearly
two
o'clock
,
so
we
decide
to
take
another
step
forward
.
 
<EOS>
We
cross
the
road
and
try
the
iron
gate
.
<EOS>
It
be
lock
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
for
it
but
to
scale
it
,
and
as
I
be
in
the
act
of
clamber
up
<EOS>
I
be
startle
by
a
strange
voice
behind
me
--
a
woman
's
voice
raise
an
alarm
!
 
<EOS>
Ray
,
who
be
stand
behind
me
,
close
with
the
unwelcome
stranger
in
an
instant
,
and
place
his
hand
forcibly
over
her
mouth
while
I
spring
back
to
assist
him
.
<EOS>
that
moment
be
an
exciting
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
put
your
handkerchief
in
her
mouth
,
man
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
you
see
who
it
be
--
the
woman
Stolberg
!
"
 
<EOS>
Quick
<EOS>
as
think
I
take
out
my
handkerchief
and
stuff
it
into
her
mouth
while
he
hold
her
.
<EOS>
then
I
grip
her
arm
,
while
Ray
produce
the
thin
silk
rope
which
he
usually
carry
on
such
expedition
and
with
<EOS>
it
bind
her
tightly
hand
and
foot
.
 
<EOS>
She
struggle
violently
,
curse
us
in
German
the
while
,
but
all
in
vain
.
<EOS>
so
at
length
we
dispose
of
her
comfortably
against
a
tree
-
trunk
in
a
field
opposite
,
to
which
Ray
very
deftly
secure
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
evidently
drive
over
from
Cromer
on
some
important
errand
to
her
friend
and
have
stop
the
cart
some
distance
away
from
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
cautiously
we
negotiate
the
high
iron
gate
,
and
creep
noiselessly
across
the
lawn
,
gain
the
window
on
the
left
of
the
entrance
.
<EOS>
Ray
flash
his
light
upon
it
,
and
note
that
the
fastening
be
only
an
ordinary
one
,
promptly
commence
work
upon
it
by
insert
one
of
his
burglarious
tool
between
the
sash
.
<EOS>
in
a
few
moment
it
spring
back
with
a
click
,
and
lift
the
sash
slowly
and
push
aside
the
holland
blind
,
he
swing
himself
into
a
comfortably
furnished
sitting
-
room
,
<EOS>
I
follow
quickly
at
his
heel
.
 
<EOS>
in
that
dead
silence
I
could
hear
my
heart
throbbing
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
actually
in
the
house
of
the
spy
!
 
<EOS>
the
room
,
which
contain
nothing
of
interest
to
us
,
smell
strongly
of
tobacco
,
while
upon
the
table
lie
a
big
german
pipe
.
<EOS>
still
grip
his
leather
bag
<EOS>
Ray
carefully
open
the
door
,
and
cross
the
wide
old
-
fashioned
hall
,
open
another
door
,
when
we
find
ourselves
in
an
old

fling

in

"
Stolberg
buy

,
full

urge

<EOS>
for

bad

persistently

he
have
be
leave
without

even
without

more
recently
he
have
be
out

altogether

now

he
add
,
with
a
keen
look
,
"
I
want
to
fix
that
point
in

<EOS>
for

ever
since
the
summer

have
be
know

be
on

no

declare
my

why

<EOS>
Ray
smile

his

assume

"
the

I
do
not

arouse

I
remark

We

he
become
immersed

man
be
come
up
by
two
and
three
from
the
river
craft
,
one
and
all
wend
their
way
to
that
low
-
browe
house
which
seem
to
be
do
such
a
roaring
trade
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
's
take
a
look
inside
,
"
Ray
suggest
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
We
may
hear
something
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
together
we
turn
back
,
and
enter
the
low
-
build
,
old
-
fashioned
place
.
 
<EOS>
within
,
we
find
them
all
discuss
the
mysterious
death
of
Jim
Pavely
.
 
<EOS>
mostly
English
be
the
bronze
,
weather
-
beat
man
of
the
sea
and
the
longshoreman
who
be
smoke
and
drink
,
and
talk
so
earnestly
,
but
a
few
foreigner
be
among
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
two
or
three
frenchman
,
dapper
fellow
in
well
-
make
pea
-
jacket
and
beret
,
who
have
row
ashore
from
the
big
white
yawl
fly
the
tricolour
,
which
have
be
lie
off
Heybridge
wait
,
so
we
hear
,
for
a
change
from
the
present
icy
weather
before
go
to
sea
again
;
and
there
be
also
a
fair
number
of
Swedes
and
Norwegians
from
the
two
timber
-
ship
whose
spar
<EOS>
,
we
have
notice
,
tower
above
the
row
of
small
and
stumpy
mast
belong
to
the
local
and
coast
craft
which
lie
alongside
the
Hithe
.
<EOS>
then
there
be
the
first
mate
of
one
of
the
timber
-
ship
,
suppose
by
most
of
those
present
to
be
a
German
.
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
he
seem
to
be
try
hard
to
carry
on
a
conversation
with
the
fair
-
haired
landlord
,
an
undoubted
immigrant
from
the
Fatherland
.
 
<EOS>
from
one
of
the
seafare
customer
with
whom
I
begin
to
chat
,
I
learn
that
the
keeper
of
the
place
be
name
Leopold
Bramberger
,
and
that
he
have
be
establish
in
that
little
river
-
side
hostelry
rather
more
than
a
year
,
and
be
now
a
well
-
know
and
more
or
less
respected
inhabitant
of
the
borough
of
Maldon
.
<EOS>
He
have
make
a
little
money
--
so
it
be
generally
understand
--
in
the
course
of
some
year
'
service
at
the
Carlton
Hotel
in
London
as
waiter
.
<EOS>
and
a
good
waiter
he
certainly
be
,
as
many
people
live
in
that
part
of
the
country
could
testify
;
since
he
find
time
to
go
out
as
"
an
extra
hand
"
to
many
a
dinner
-
party
;
his
service
be
much
appreciate
and
bring
him
in
quite
a
comfortable
little
addition
to
what
he
make
by
the
sale
of
drink
down
by
the
Blackwater
.
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
seem
very
anxious
to
talk
with
his
compatriot
;
indeed
,
so
frequent
be
the
demand
make
for
"
another
pot
of
four
'
arf
,
"
"
two
of
gin
'
ot
,
"
"
<EOS>
another
glass
of
Scotch
,
"
and
other
delectable
beverage
,
that
he
and
his
well
half
have
all
they
could
do
to
grapple
with
the
want
of
their
customer
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
conversation
about
us
we
gather
that
the
dead
man
,
though
previously
somewhat
abstemious
,
have
lately
become
rather
a
constant
frequenter
of
the
"
Goat
and
Binnacle
,
"
and
though
no
one
have
see
him
actually
drunk
,
there
be
not
a
few
who
could
testify
to
have
see
him
in
a
state
very
nearly
approach
,
in
their
opinion
,
to
"
half

<EOS>

not

favourable

I

<EOS>
"
oh
,
you
know
him
well
enough

He
be
often

"
 
<EOS>
"
no

he

I
would
know
a

well
enough

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well

I
have
hear
him
speak

Mr.

the

once
he

he

so
he
do
,
Sergeant

"
speak
up

now
you
mention
it

<EOS>
I
be
often

an
'
I

the

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
anything
about
that
forty
-
nine
pound
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
ask
the
blunder
local
sergeant
of
police
,
for
,
as
be
usually
the
case
,
the
aid
of
New
Scotland
Yard
have
not
be
invoke
.
<EOS>
the
police
in
our
small
country
town
be
always
very
loath
to
request
assistance
from
London
,
as
such
action
be
admission
of
their
own
incompetence
.
<EOS>
many
a
murder
mystery
could
be
solve
and
the
criminal
bring
to
justice
by
prompt
investigation
by
competent
detective
.
<EOS>
but
after
blunt
inquiry
such
as
those
now
in
progress
,
success
be
usually
render
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
Raymond
exchange
glance
with
me
and
smile
.
<EOS>
how
different
,
I
reflect
,
be
his
careful
,
painstaking
,
and
often
mysterious
method
of
investigation
.
 
<EOS>
"
those
sovereign
in
'
be
'
andkerchief
be
a
puzzle
,
"
declare
the
man
Rait
,
"
but
somehow
I
fancy
there
be
be
<EOS>
a
bit
o
'
mystery
about
pore
Jim
of
late
.
<EOS>
Teddy
Owen
tell
me
a
week
ago
'
e
see
'
i
be
up
in
London
,
a
-
talkin
'
with
a
foreigner
on
the
platform
at
Liverpool
Street
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
where
be
Owen
?
"
ask
the
sergeant
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
go
over
to
Malmoe
on
a
swedish
timber
-
ship
,
"
be
Robert
Rait
's
reply
.
"
<EOS>
'
e
will
not
be
back
for
a
couple
of
month
,
I
dare
say
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
statement
of
the
man
Owen
be
to
Raymond
and
myself
very
significant
and
suspicious
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
the
pilot
pavely
have
sell
some
secret
to
a
foreign
agent
,
and
that
the
money
he
carry
with
him
on
the
previous
night
be
the
price
of
his
treason
?
<EOS>
It
be
distinctly
curious
that
the
assassin
have
not
possess
himself
of
that
handkerchief
full
of
sovereign
.
 
<EOS>
We
linger
in
the
low
-
pitch
inn
for
yet
another
half
-
hour
,
my
companion
account
for
our
visit
by
tell
one
of
the
man
a
fictitious
story
that
we
have
be
send
to
install
the
electric
light
in
some
new
premise
at
the
back
of
the
old
church
.
<EOS>
We
hear
several
more
inquiry
make
by
the
sergeant
,
and
many
be
the
wild
theory
advance
by
those
seafare
lounger
.
<EOS>
then
,
have
listen
attentively
to
all
that
pass
,
we
retrace
our
step
to
the
station
,
obtain
our
bag
,
and
drive
to
the
King
's
Head
Hotel
,
where
we
duly
instal
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
something
very
big
behind
the
cruel
murder
of
the
pilot
--
that
be
my
belief
!
"
declare
Raymond
before
we
part
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
nobody
here
dream
the
truth
--
a
truth
that
will
be
find
as
startling
as
it
be
strange
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
of
my
suspicion
that
the
publican
Bramberger
be
a
spy
.
<EOS>
but
he
shake
his
head
,
say
:
 
"
do
not
form
any
immature
conclusion
,
my
dear
Jacox
.
<EOS>
at
present
the
truth
be
very
cunningly
conceal
.
<EOS>
It
remain
for
us
to
lift
the
veil
and
expose
the
truth
to
the
police
and
the
public
.
<EOS>
good
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
three
day
pass
.
<EOS>
Ray
Raymond
remain
practically
inactive
,
save
that
we
both
attend
the
inquest
at
Southminster
as
member
of
the
public
and
listen
to
the
evidence
.
<EOS>
the
revelation
that
a
man
apparently
in
a
state
of
great
destitution
carry
forty
-
nine
sovereign
upon
him
strike
the
coroner
as
unusual
,
and
at
his
direction
the
jury
adjourn
the
inquiry
for
a
week
,
to
allow
the
police
to
make
further
investigation
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
this
be
decide
my
companion
at
once
become
all
activity
.
<EOS>
He
find
the
man
Rait
,
a
big
,
clumsy
seafarer
,
and
question
him
.
<EOS>
but
from
him
he
obtain
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
with
the
publican
Bramberger
he
contrive
to
strike
up
a
friendship
,
loudly
declare
his
theory
that
the
motive
of
the
murder
of
poor
pavely
be
jealousy
,
it
be
now
know
that
he
have
be
court
the
pretty
daughter
of
an
old
boatman
over
at

<EOS>
My
position
be
,
as
usual
,
one
of
silent
obedience
.
<EOS>
hither
and
thither
<EOS>
I
go
at
his
bidding
,
leave
to
his
,
the
master
mind
,
the
gradual
solution
of
the
mystery
.
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
those
secretive
man
who
delight
in
retain
something
up
his
sleeve
.
<EOS>
the
expression
upon
his
face
be
never
indicative
of
what
be
pass
within
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
the
adjourn
inquest
be
hold
at
last
,
and
again
we
be
both
present
at
the
back
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
the
police
practically
admit
their
inability
to
solve
the
mystery
,
and
after
a
long
deliberation
the
twelve
tradesman
return
a
verdict
of
"
wilful
murder
,
"
leave
the
constabulary
to
further
prosecute
their
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
nearly
a
fortnight
have
pass
since
the
sturdy
North
Sea
pilot
have
be
so
cruelly
do
to
death
,
and
many
be
the
new
theory
advance
nightly
in
the
smoke
-
room
of
the
"
Goat
and
Binnacle
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
still
remain
at
the
"
King
's
Head
,
"
but
Raymond
be
often
absent
for
whole
day
,
and
by
his
manner
I
know
the
spy
-
seeker
to
be
busy
investigate
some
theory
he
have
form
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
absent
a
couple
of
day
,
stay
over
at
the
"
White
Hart
"
at
Burnham
-
on
-
Crouch
,
that
place
so
frequent
by
boat
man
in
summer
,
when
one
afternoon
I
run
over
to
Chelmsford
to
call
upon
a
man
I
know
.
<EOS>
It
be
about
ten
o'clock
at
night
when
I
leave
his
house
to
walk
to
the
station
to
catch
the
last
train
,
when
,
to
my
surprise
,
I
see
close
to
the
Town
Hall
a
smart
female
figure
in
a
black
tailor
-
make
gown
and
big
black
hat
,
walk
before
me
,
accompany
by
a
tall
,
thin
,
rather
well
-
dress
young
man
in
breech
and
gaiter
,
who
seem
to
be
something
of
a
dandy
.
 
<EOS>
the
girl
's
back
strike
me
as
familiar
,
and
I
cross
the
road
and
go
forward
so
as
to
get
a
glance
at
her
face
beneath
the
street
-
lamp
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
I
be
not
mistake
.
<EOS>
It
be
Vera
Vallance
!
<EOS>
Her
companion
,
however
,
be
a
complete
stranger
to
me
--
a
well
-
set
-
up
,
rather
good
-
look
young
fellow
,
with
a
small
black
moustache
,
whose
age
I
guess
to
be
about
twenty
-
eight
or
so
,
and
whose
dark
eye
be
peculiarly
bright
and
vivacious
.
<EOS>
He
walk
with
swagger
gait
,
and
seem
to
be
of
a
decidedly
horsey
type
.
 
<EOS>
from
their
attitude
it
appear
that
they
be
intimate
friend
,
and
as
they
walk
towards
the
station
,
I
watch
his
hand
steal
into
her
astrachan
muff
.
 
<EOS>
the
incident
be
certainly
puzzle
.
<EOS>
be
this
man
Vera
's
secret
lover
?
<EOS>
It
certainly
seem
so
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
unseen
by
her
,
I
keep
close
vigilance
upon
the
pair
,
watch
them
gain
the
platform
where
stand
the
train
by
which
I
be
to
travel
back
to
Maldon
.
<EOS>
He
enter
a
first
-
class
carriage
,
while
she
remain
upon
the
platform
.
<EOS>
therefore
it
be
evident
that
she
be
not
accompany
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
train
move
off
,
and
,
with
a
laugh
,
she
actually
kiss
her
hand
to
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
then
I
sit
back
in
my
corner
greatly
puzzle
and
disturb
.
<EOS>
surely
Ray
Raymond
could
not
know
of
these
clandestine
meeting
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
well
aware
how
devoted
my
friend
be
to
her
.
<EOS>
surely
she
be
not
now
faithless
to
her
vow
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
my
place
to
speak
,
so
<EOS>
I
could
only
patiently
watch
the
progress
of
event
.
 
<EOS>
the
dark
-
eyed
man
alight
with
me
at
Witham
,
but
do
not
enter
the
Maldon
train
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
lose
sight
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
three
day
later
I
catch
sight
of
him
in
the
main
street
at
Maldon
,
still
in
gaiter
and
riding
-
breech
,
and
wear
a
black
and
white
check
coat
and
crimson
knit
vest
.
<EOS>
unnoticed
,
I
watch
him
come
forth
from
a
saddler
's
shop
,
and
after
make
several
purchase
,
he
stroll
to
my
hotel
,
the
"
King
's
Head
,
"
where
he
be
meet
by
an
elderly
clean
-
shaven
man
of
agricultural
type
,
with
whom
he
have
luncheon
in
a
corner
of
the
coffee
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
be
still
absent
.
<EOS>
Would
that
he
have
be
present
,
and
that
I
dare
to
point
out
to
him
the
man
who
have
apparently
usurp
his
place
in
Vera
's
heart
!
 
<EOS>
at
three
o'clock
,
after
his
friend
have
leave
,
the
young
man
sit
for
some
time
write
a
letter
in
the
smoking
-
room
,
and
afterwards
call
the
boot
and
give
it
to
him
,
with
order
to
deliver
it
personally
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
leave
for
the
station
apparently
on
his
return
to
Witham
.
 
<EOS>
after
I
get
back
to
the
"
King
's
Head
"
I
seek
James
,
the
boot
,
and
inquire
the
addressee
of
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
take
it
round
to
Mr.
Bramberger
at
the
'
Goat
and
Binnacle
,
'
sir
,
"
be
the
servant
's
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
the
young
gentleman
--
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
He
be
Mr.
Freeman
,
from
Woodham
Ferris
.
<EOS>
He
be
what
they
call
a
'
mud
-
pupil
'
of
Mr.
Harris
,
Lord
Croyland
's
agent
.
<EOS>
He
be
learn
estate
-
work
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
he
know
Mr.
Bramberger
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
take
note
for
him
to
the
'
Goat
and
Binnacle
.
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
silent
,
recollect
the
curious
allegation
make
by
the
man
Rait
,
that
he
have
see
the
dead
man
in
Freeman
's
company
.
 
<EOS>
some
other
question
I
put
to
the
boot
,
but
he
could
tell
me
but
little
else
,
only
that
young
Freeman
be
undoubtedly
a
gentleman
,
that
he
spend
his
money
freely
,
and
possess
a
large
circle
of
friend
in
the
district
.
 
<EOS>
I
learn
that
he
live
in
a
small
furnished
cottage
outside
the
dull
little
town
of
Woodham
Ferris
,
and
that
he
have
an
elderly
man
-
servant
who
generally
"
do
"
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
have
I
be
mistaken
in
Vera
's
motive
?
<EOS>
have
she
become
acquainted
with
him
as
part
of
a
preconceived
plan
,
some
ingenious
plan
form
by
that
fearless
hunter
of
the
Kaiser
's
spy
,
who
be
my
most
intimate
friend
?
 
<EOS>
yes
,
I
could
only
think
that
I
have
sorely
misjudge
her
.
 
<EOS>
hear
nothing
from
Raymond
on
the
follow
day
,
and
notice
that
the
sensation
cause
by
the
death
of
the
pilot
have
,
by
this
time
,
quite
subside
,
I
go
again
over
to
Chelmsford
and
lunch
at
the
old
-
fashioned
"
Saracen
's
Head
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
to
my
satisfaction
,
I
learn
that
Vera
have
be
stay
there
for
the
past
ten
day
,
and
be
still
there
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
I
leave
the
hotel
and
watch
it
during
the
remainder
of
that
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
at
dusk
she
come
forth
neat
and
pretty
as
usual
,
her
face
with
its
soft
fair
hair
half
conceal
by
her
flimsy
veil
.
<EOS>
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
she
hesitate
for
a
second
,
then
she
stroll
to
the
other
side
of
the
town
,
where
,
at
an
unfrequented
corner
,
she
be
join
by
the
dark
-
eyed
man
Freeman
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
warm
manner
of
his
greeting
it
be
apparent
that
he
be
charm
by
her
,
and
together
they
stroll
along
the
quiet
byway
,
<EOS>
she
allow
him
to
link
his
arm
in
hers
.
 
<EOS>
know
her
ready
self
-
sacrifice
wherever
the
interest
of
her
lover
be
concern
,
I
could
only
surmise
that
her
present
object
be
to
watch
this
man
,
or
to
learn
from
him
some
important
fact
concern
the
mystery
which
Ray
be
so
silently
investigate
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
fear
to
be
observe
if
I
follow
the
pair
along
those
quiet
thoroughfare
,
I
turn
on
my
heel
,
and
half
an
hour
later
leave
Chelmsford
for
Maldon
.
 
<EOS>
that
same
night
,
soon
after
eleven
,
Ray
Raymond
return
to
the
"
King
's
Head
,
"
arrive
by
the
last
train
from
London
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
keep
a
wary
eye
upon
that
publican
Bramberger
,
Jacox
,
"
he
whisper
when
we
be
alone
together
in
my
bedroom
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
deal
with
him
.
<EOS>
frequent
<EOS>
the
'
Goat
and
Binnacle
,
'
and
see
what
be
in
progress
there
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Vera
be
at
Chelmsford
,
I
see
,
"
I
remark
casually
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
he
say
,
"
she
be
already
on
friendly
term
with
Freeman
.
<EOS>
You
have
see
her
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
respond
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
to
-
morrow
I
shall
leave
here
again
,
to
reappear
in
Maldon
as
a
river
-
side
labourer
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
retain
your
role
of
electrician
,
and
patronise
the
homely
comfort
of
our
friend
Bramberger
's
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
speak
with
that
clear
decision
which
characterise
all
his
action
,
<EOS>
for
in
the
investigation
of
any
suspicion
of
the
presence
of
spy
,
he
first
form
his
theory
,
and
then
start
straight
away
to
prove
it
to
his
own
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
soon
after
one
o'clock
I
re
-
enter
the
low
-
build
little
river
-
side
inn
and
find
within
a
few
bargeman
and
labourer
gossip
,
as
such
man
will
gossip
.
<EOS>
the
landlord
who
serve
me
eye
me
up
and
down
as
though
half
incline
to
recognise
me
,
so
I
recall
the
fact
that
I
have
be
in
his
house
a
week
or
so
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
he
immediately
become
communicative
,
and
we
have
a
friendly
glass
together
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
that
I
have
conclude
my
job
--
in
order
to
account
for
my
hour
of
idleness
in
the
day
that
be
to
follow
--
and
I
then
become
a
regular
customer
,
seldom
leave
before
the
house
close
.
 
<EOS>
Bramberger
be
one
day
visit
by
the
german
mate
of
the
timber
-
ship
which
have
just
come
in
,
the
man
of
his
own
nationality
who
have
be
in
the
bar
on
the
night
of
our
arrival
at
Maldon
,
and
who
seem
to
be
well
known
to
his
usual
customer
,
for
apparently
he
make
regular
visit
from
across
the
North
Sea
.
 
<EOS>
I
notice
that
during
the
afternoon
they
be
closet
together
in
the
landlord
's
private
room
,
and
during
the
evening
they
drink
in
company
.
 
<EOS>
the
return
of
this
German
at
once
arouse
my
suspicion
,
therefore
at
ten
o'clock
,
instead
of
return
to
the
"
King
's
Head
,
"
I
conceal
myself
at
the
waterside
and
there
wait
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
intensely
cold
vigil
,
and
as
the
time
creep
by
,
and
the
church
clock
strike
hour
after
hour
,
I
begin
to
fear
that
my
suspicion
be
unfounded
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
however
,
from
the
timber
-
craft
lying
in
the
Blackwater
come
a
boat
noiselessly
into
the
deep
shadow
,
and
from
it
land
two
man
,
each
carry
a
heavy
box
upon
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
They
walk
straight
over
to
the
"
Goat
and
Binnacle
,
"
the
side
door
of
which
open
noiselessly
,
and
have
deposit
their
load
,
they
return
to
the
boat
.
<EOS>
this
journey
to
and
fro
they
repeat
four
time
.
<EOS>
then
they
row
away
,
and
though
I
wait
the
great
part
of
the
night
,
they
do
not
return
.
 
<EOS>
I
report
this
in
a
note
I
send
round
to
Ray
at
his
lodging
in
the
poor
quarter
of
the
town
,
and
in
reply
I
receive
a
message
that
he
would
meet
me
at
the
river
-
side
at
eleven
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
part
of
that
evening
<EOS>
I
spend
smoking
in
the
inn
,
and
<EOS>
an
hour
after
close
-
time
I
come
upon
my
friend
with
whisper
greeting
at
the
appoint
spot
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
see
Freeman
?
"
be
his
first
question
,
and
when
I
reply
in
the
negative
,
he
tell
me
that
he
have
just
be
admit
by
Bramberger
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
get
your
revolver
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
he
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
always
carry
it
nowadays
,
"
be
my
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
old
chap
,
to
-
night
promise
to
be
exciting
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
.
"
<EOS>
look
!
<EOS>
there
be
three
man
lurk
under
that
wall
over
yonder
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
"
he
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
They
be
our
friend
.
<EOS>
to
-
night
we
shall
avenge
the
death
of
the
poor
pilot
pavely
.
<EOS>
but
remain
silent
,
and
you
will
see
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
note
that
the
three
dark
figure
conceal
near
us
be
water
-
side
labourer
,
<EOS>
fellow
whose
rough
-
look
exterior
be
the
reverse
of
reassuring
.
<EOS>
yet
I
recollect
that
every
man
who
work
on
the
Blackwater
or
the
Crouch
be
a
patriot
,
ready
to
tear
the
mask
from
the
spy
of
England
's
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
have
wait
in
patience
fully
three
hour
,
when
again
from
the
timber
-
ship
lie
in
the
Blackwater
come
the
laden
boat
,
and
again
be
similar
box
land
and
carry
in
the
shadow
up
to
the
inn
,
the
door
of
which
open
silently
to
receive
them
.
<EOS>
wherever
the
Customs
officer
or
police
be
,
they
notice
nothing
amiss
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
man
have
make
their
second
journey
to
the
"
Goat
and
Binnacle
,
"
when
Ray
Raymond
suddenly
exclaim
:
 
<EOS>
"
We
be
go
to
rush
the
place
,
Jacox
.
<EOS>
have
your
gun
ready
"
;
and
then
he
give
a
low
whistle
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
moment
fully
a
dozen
man
,
some
of
whom
I
recognise
as
Customs
officer
in
mufti
and
police
in
plain
clothe
,
together
with
several
longshoreman
,
emerge
from
the
shadow
,
and

<EOS>
He

the

have
make
him
promise
to
keep
his
secret
till

I

all
he

pavely
tell

something

something
he
have
discover

<EOS>
but
I
foolishly
laugh
his
statement
to
scorn
.
<EOS>
He
add
that
he
be
to
sail
in
a
french
schooner
that
night
,
and
that
Freeman
,
who

over

that
evening

him
at

<EOS>
when
he
have
go

the
story
he
have

strike
me
as

therefore
I
resolve
to
follow
him

<EOS>
I
see
him
come
with
Freeman
out
of

place
just
after
midnight
,

I
follow
them

<EOS>
when
they
get
to
Button

Hill

on

lonely
stretch

I
see
with

Freeman
suddenly
attack
him
with
a
life

preserver
,
and
have
smash
his
skull
before
I
could
interfere

He
try

hollow
before
the

<EOS>
He
have
collapse

<EOS>
"
My
first
impulse

to
denounce

but
what
the

cause

to
hesitate

the
truth
remain
--
a
very
bitter
,
serious
,
and
significant
truth
--
of
Germany
's
hostile
intention
at
a
not
distant
date
,
a
date
when
an
Englishman
's
home
will

alas

CHAPTER
v
 
the
SECRET
of
the
new
BRITISH
AEROPLANE
  
<EOS>
"
if
we
could
only
approach
the
Military
Ballooning
Department
we
may
,
perhaps
,
learn
something
,
"
I
remark
.
"
<EOS>
but
I
suppose
that
be
quite
out
of
the
question
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
quite
,
"
declare
Ray
.
<EOS>
"
We
should
receive
no
information
,
and
only
be
laugh
at
for
our
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
think
that
the
new
Kershaw
aeroplane
can
be
the
one
now
be
try
by
the
Royal
Engineers
with
so
much
secrecy
on
the
Duke
of
Atholl
's
estate
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
"
be
his
prompt
reply
.
<EOS>
"
My
reason
briefly
be
because
I
have
discover
that
two
Germans
stay
at
the
Blair
Arms
Hotel
,
at
Blair
Atholl
,
for
six
week
last
summer
,
and
then
suddenly
disappear
--
probably
take
with
them
the
plan
of
the
airship
about
which
there
have
be
so
much
secrecy
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
quite
follow
you
,
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
there
be
still
another
fact
.
<EOS>
a
month
ago
there
arrive
in
England
a
man
name
Karl
Straus
,
a
lieutenant
of
the
Military
Ballooning
Department
of
the
german
Army
station
at
Duesseldorf
.
<EOS>
He
pay
several
visit
to
our
friend
Hartmann
in
Pont
Street
,
and
then
disappear
from
London
.
<EOS>
now
,
why
do
he
come
on
a
special
mission
to
England
?
<EOS>
for
one
reason
.
<EOS>
because
of
the
failure
of
Germany
's
hope
,
the
Zeppelin
airship
,
combine
with
the
report
that
our
new
Kershaw
aeroplane
be
the
most
perfect
of
the
many
invention
,
and
destine
to
effect
a
revolution
in
warfare
.
<EOS>
the
Kershaw
,
which
be
only
complete
at
South
Farnborough
two
month
ago
,
be
now
be
try
in
strictest
secrecy
.
<EOS>
Vera
be
tell
so
by
an
engineer
officer
she
meet
at
a
dance
at
Chatham
a
short
time
ago
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
it
be
be
try
here
in
the
north
somewhere
,
"
I
add
,
as
together
,
seat
in
a
"
forty
-
eight
Daimler
,
"
we
ascend
Glen
Garry
from
Blair
Atholl
--
which
we
have
leave
a
couple
of
hour
before
--
and
speed
along
over
the
wild
,
treeless
Grampians
towards
Dalwhinnie
.
<EOS>
the
March
morning
be
bitterly
cold
,
and
snow
cover
the
ground
,
render
the
Highland
scenery
more
picturesque
and
imposing
.
<EOS>
and
as
we
prefer
an
open
car
to
a
closed
one
,
the
journey
be
very
cold
.
 
<EOS>
Our
inquiry
in
Blair
Atholl
have
have
a
negative
result
.
<EOS>
in
the
long
,
old
-
fashioned
Blair
Arms
Hotel
Ray
have
make
a
number
of
search
inquiry
,
for
though
two
officer
of
the
Ballooning
Department
live
there
,
and
have
be
conduct
the
experiment
in
Blair
Park
,
it
be
plain
that
the
machine
have
never
yet
take
flight
.
<EOS>
so
the
pair
of
mysterious
Germans
,
whose
name
we
discover
in
the
visitor
'
book
,
have
either
obtain
the
detail
they
want
or
have
leave
the
neighbourhood
in
disgust
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
at
my
friend
's
suggestion
that
we
have
hire
the
car
from
Perth
,
and
have
now
set
out
upon
a
tour
of
discovery
in
the
wild
and
least
frequented
district
of
the
Highlands
--
some
of
which
be
in
winter
the
most
unfrequented
in
all
Great
Britain
.
<EOS>
something
--
what
I
know
not
--
have
apparently
convince
him
that
the
test
be
still
in
progress
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
where
the
trial
be
take
place
we
shall
<EOS>
,
I
feel
certain
,
find
this
inquisitive
person
Karl
Straus
,
"
he
declare
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
from
Berlin
,
through
a
confidential
source
,
I
hear
that
it
be
he
who
obtain
the
German
General
Staff
photograph
and
plan
of
the
new
french
aeroplane
that
be
try
down
in
the
basque
country
last
May
<EOS>
He
be
an
expert
aeronaut
and
engineer
,
and
speak
English
well
;
our
object
be
to
discover
his
whereabouts
.
"
 
<EOS>
in
pursuance
of
this
quest
we
visit
the
various
hotel
on
our
way
north
.
<EOS>
the
"
Loch
Ericht
"
at
Dalwhinnie
we
find
closed
,
therefore
we
go
on
to
Newtonmore
,
and
by
take
luncheon
at
the
hotel
there
ascertain
that
there
be
no
visitor
who
may
be
either
british
military
officer
or
german
spy
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
gloomy
,
frosty
afternoon
<EOS>
we
,
a
month
after
the
affair
down
at
Maldon
,
speed
up
the
Speyside
through
dark
pine
forest
and
snow
-
cover
moorland
till
we
find
ourselves
in
the
long
grey
street
of
Kingussie
,
where
we
halt
at
the
Star
Hotel
,
a
small
place
with
a
verandah
,
very
popular
in
summer
,
but
in
winter
desert
.
 
<EOS>
leave
me
to
warm
myself
at
the
fire
,
Ray
cross
to
the
telegraph
office
to
despatch
a
message
,
and
afterwards
I
see
him
enter
a
small
shop
where
picture
post
-
card
be
sell
.
<EOS>
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
remain
inside
,
and
then
go
to
another
shop
a
few
door
further
down
.
 
<EOS>
afterwards
he
rejoin
me
,
and
as
we
remount
into
the
car
I
see
that
his
face
wear
a
dark
,
puzzled
expression
.
 
<EOS>
"
anything
wrong
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
,
as
we
speed
away
through
the
fir
towards
Loch
Alvie
and
Aviemore
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
he
reply
.
<EOS>
then
,
after
a
pause
,
he
ask
,
"
You
once
use
to
ride
a
motor
-
cycle
,
do
not
you
,
Jack
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
reply
in
the
affirmative
;
whereupon
he
say
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
me
to
hire
one
,
an
observation
which
somewhat
mystify
me
.
<EOS>
and
for
the
next
hour
we
roar
along
over
the
loose
,
uneven
road
through
Aviemore
,
where
the
chief
hotel
be
,
of
course
,
closed
,
and
on
over
Dulnan
Bridge
,
that
paradise
of
the
summer
tourist
;
then
turn
to
the
right
past
the
post
office
,
until
we
be
soon
"
honk
-
honk
"
up
the
wide
main
street
of
Grantown
.
 
<EOS>
here
in
summer
and
autumn
the
place
be
alive
with
tourist
;
but
in
winter
,
with
its
tear
wind
and
gusty
snowstorm
,
the
little
place
present
a
very
different
appearance
.
<EOS>
the
excellent
"
Grant
Arms
,
"
stand
back
from
the
road
at
the
further
end
of
the
town
,
be
,
however
,
one
of
the
few
first
-
class
hotel
in
the
Highlands
open
all
the
year
round
.
<EOS>
and
here
we
put
up
,
both
of
us
glad
to
obtain
shelter
from
the
sleet
which
,
since
the
twilight
have
fade
,
have
be
cut
our
face
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
sit
before
the
big
smoking
-
room
fire
with
a
cigarette
,
after
we
have
be
to
our
room
to
remove
the
mud
from
our
face
,
Ray
be
bustle
about
the
hotel
,
eagerly
scan
the
visitor
'
book
,
among
other
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Our
quest
be
a
decidedly
vague
one
,
and
as
I
sit
stare
into
the
flame
I
confess
I
entertain
serious
misgiving
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
go
forth
into
the
hall
to
find
my
friend
,
I
be
tell
that
he
have
go
out
.
 
<EOS>
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
he
return
,
say
:
 
"
I
have
see
a
garage
along
the
street
;
come
with
me
and
hire
a
motor
-
cycle
.
<EOS>
You
will
probably
want
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
wait
and
see
<EOS>
,
"
be
his
response
;
therefore
I
put
on
my
hat
and
coat
and
walk
with
him
to
the
garage
,
about
half
-
way
along
the
street
,
where
I
pick
out
a
good
strong
machine
which
be
duly
wheel
back
to
the
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
that
night
,
among
the
eight
or
nine
guest
assemble
for
dinner
,
there
be
not
one
who
have
any
resemblance
either
to
a
german
spy
or
an
officer
of
the
Military
Balloon
Factory
at
South
Farnborough
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
day
follow
we
use
our
map
well
,
scour
the
whole
of
the
Spey
side
to
the
Bridge
of
Avon
,
and
on
to
rothe
,
while
westward
we
drive
by
Carrbridge
,
over
the
Slochd
Mor
to
Loch
Moy
and
across
to
Daviot
.
<EOS>
We
explore
the
steep
hill
of
Cromdale
and
Glen
Tulchan
,
survey
the
rugged
country
from
the
summit
of
Carn
Glas
,
and
make
judicious
inquiry
in
all
quarter
,
both
among
village
people
,
shepherd
,
and
other
.
<EOS>
nowhere
however
could
we
gather
any
information
that
any
trial
of
an
airship
be
in
progress
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
in
legging
,
mackintosh
,
and
goggle
,
I
go
forth
alone
on
my
motor
-
cycle
,
negotiate
the
rough
byway
and
make
confidential
inquiry
.
<EOS>
but
the
result
be
ever
a
negative
one
and
always
dishearten
.
 
<EOS>
on
one
occasion
I
have
be
out
alone
and
reach
the
hotel
,
when
,
some
hour
later
,
our
chauffeur
return
with
the
car
empty
,
and
hand
me
a
hastily
scribble
note
to
explain
that
Ray
have
leave
suddenly
for
the
south
and
instruct
me
to
remain
at
Grantown
till
his
return
.
 
<EOS>
by
that
I
imagine
that
he
have
make
some
discovery
.
<EOS>
or
have
he
go
south
to
see
Vera
,
his
well
-
beloved
?
 
<EOS>
curiously
enough
,
next
day
a
foreigner
--
probably
a
German
--
arrive
at
the
hotel
,
and
,
as
may
be
imagine
,
I
at
once
take
step
to
keep
him
under
the
strict
observation
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
quiet
,
apparently
inoffensive
person
about
thirty
-
five
,
who
,
among
his
impedimenta
,
bring
a
motor
-
cycle
and
box
camera
.
<EOS>
before
he
have
be
in
the
place
<EOS>
twenty
-
four
hour
I
have
convince
myself
that
he
be
the
spy
Straus
.
 
<EOS>
this
fact
I
wire
to
Bruton
Street
in
the
code
we
have
long
ago
arrange
,
hope
that
the
message
would
find
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
to
my
surprise
,
all
the
reply
I
get
be
:
"
be
careful
that
you
have
make
no
mistake
.
"
 
<EOS>
what
could
he
mean
?
<EOS>
I
read
and
re
-
read
the
message
,
but
remain
much
puzzled
,
while
my
excitement
increase
.
 
<EOS>
each
day
the
new
arrival
,
who
have
write
the
name
of
"
F.
Goldstein
"
in
the
visitor
'
book
,
go
forth
on
his
cycle
to
explore
the
beauty
of
the
Highlands
,
the
thaw
have
now
clear
the
road
,
and
on
each
occasion
I
manage
by
dint
of
many
subterfuge
to
watch
his
proceeding
.
<EOS>
His
gaze
be
ever
in
the
distance
,
and
each
time
he
gain
high
ground
he
sweep
the
surround
country
with
a
pair
of
powerful
prismatic
field
-
glass
.
 
<EOS>
I
confess
<EOS>
I
be
rather
annoy
at
Ray
's
conduct
in
thus
abandon
me
at
the
very
moment
of
my
discovery
<EOS>
,
for
here
be
the
ballooning
expert
Straus
bent
upon
see
and
photograph
our
new
arm
of
defence
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
day
pass
I
exert
every
precaution
,
yet
I
follow
him
everywhere
,
sometimes
use
the
car
,
and
at
other
the
motor
-
cycle
.
 
<EOS>
the
spy
,
a
bespectacled
,
round
-
face
Teuton
who
speak
with
a
strong
accent
,
be
ever
active
,
ever
eager
to
discover
something
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
yet
,
to
my
intense
satisfaction
,
he
seem
to
be
utterly
unaware
that
I
be
keep
so
strict
a
watch
upon
his
movement
.
<EOS>
purposely
I
avoid
speak
to
him
in
the
hotel
,
for
fear
of
arouse
his
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
one
day
Mr.
Goldstein
do
not
appear
,
and
in
response
to
my
inquiry
the
waiter
inform
me
that
he
have
catch
cold
and
be
confine
to
his
room
.
 
<EOS>
a
spy
with
a
cold
!
<EOS>
I
laugh
within
myself
,
and
the
afternoon
be
bright
<EOS>
,
I
take
a
run
south
through
the
Abernethy
Forest
down
to
Loch
Pityoulish
.
<EOS>
on
my
return
I
cross
Dulnan
Bridge
,
where
the
turbulent
Dulnan
River
hurtle
along
over
the
stone
on
its
way
down
to
the
Spey
.
<EOS>
I
dismount
,
hot
and
tired
,
and
prop
up
my
cycle
against
the
parapet
to
rest
and
admire
the
dark
pine
-
clothe
gorge
which
open
to
the
north
.
 
<EOS>
My
reflection
be
suddenly
cut
short
by
a
loud
humming
sound
which
seem
to
come
from
the
road
which
I
have
just
traverse
.
<EOS>
instinctively
I
look
round
for
the
approach
motor
-
car
.
<EOS>
the
sound
come
nearer
,
but
instead
of
a
car
,
I
see
in
the
air
,
above
the
top
of
the
fir
against
the
distant
hill
in
the
background
,
a
splendid
aeroplane
with
two
man
aboard
.
<EOS>
swiftly
it
sweep
over
the
stream
with
the
ease
and
majesty
of
an
enormous
albatross
!
 
<EOS>
next
instant
it
have
disappear
from
my
gaze
.
<EOS>
yet
in
that
brief
moment
I
have
have
ocular
demonstration
that
the
secret
trial
be
in
progress
in
the
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
I
wait
on
tiptoe
with
excitement
.
<EOS>
again
the
whirring
sound
come
nearer
,
the
occupant
of
the
neighbouring
cottage
be
undisturbed
,
believe
it
to
be
a
motor
-
car
.
<EOS>
once
again
I
see
the
new
aeroplane
circle
above
the
tree
-
top
to
the
north
,
after
which
it
turn
suddenly
and
make
off
in
a
bee
-
line
south
,
in
the
direction
<EOS>
whence
I
have
travel
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
actually
see
the
new
invention
!
 
<EOS>
scarcely
,
however
,
have
I
recover
from
my
surprise
when
I
hear
,
come
from
the
direction
of
Grantown
,
the
"
pop
-
pop
-
pop
"
of
a
motor
-
cycle
,
and
across
the
bridge
like
a
flash
,
in
the
direction
the
aerial
machine
have
take
,
come
the
spy
whom
I
have
only
that
morning
leave
an
invalid
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
that
evening
,
while
write
a
letter
in
the
hotel
,
I
have
a
surprise
;
I
be
call
to
the
telephone
,
and
hear
Ray
's
voice
ask
me
to
send
the
car
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
that
he
be
stay
as
Mr.
Charles
Black
at
the
Star
Hotel
in
Kingussie
,
about
twenty
-
eight
mile
distant
,
and
promise
to
come
over
to
see
me
shortly
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
what
I
have
see
that
afternoon
,
and
how
the
spy
have
be
on
the
alert
,
but
to
my
surprise
he
only
reply
:
 
<EOS>
"
good
!
<EOS>
keep
on
the
watch
.
<EOS>
if
what
I
expect
be
true
,
then
we
be
on
a
big
thing
.
<EOS>
keep
in
touch
with
me
on
the
'
phone
,
and
have
a
continuous
eye
on
your
Mr.
Goldstein
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
reply
that
I
would
,
and
that
our
friend
have
just
return
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
ring
off
.
 
<EOS>
why
be
he
at
Kingussie
,
instead
of
assist
me
?
 
<EOS>
next
day
I
be
early
astir
,
and
before
luncheon
have
cover
many
mile
on
the
motor
-
cycle
.
<EOS>
Ray
have
not
ask
me
over
to
Kingussie
.
<EOS>
if
he
want
me
,
he
would
have
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
Goldstein
have
not
appear
downstairs
,
therefore
after
luncheon
,
I
go
forth
again
,
take
the
road
northward
from
Grantown
,
and
just
as
I
be
pass
beneath
the
castellate
railway
-
bridge
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
hotel
<EOS>
,
I
again
suddenly
see
straight
before
me
the
wonderful
Kershaw
aeroplane
.
<EOS>
the
car
look
like
a
long
,
thin
cylinder
of
bright
silvery
metal
,
which
I
take
to
be
aluminium
,
and
in
it
I
discern
two
man
.
 
<EOS>
It
travel
in
a
circle
several
time
over
the
tree
-
top
,
and
then
,
just
as
at
Dulnan
Bridge
,
it
dive
straight
away
over
the
dark
pine
forest
towards
the
lonely
moor
of
Cromdale
.
<EOS>
without
a
second
's
hesitation
I
mount
and
ride
full
speed
after
her
,
keep
her
well
in
sight
as
I
go
towards
Deva
.
 
<EOS>
yet
scarcely
have
I
go
half
a
mile
when
I
again
hear
behind
me
the
"
pop
-
pop
-
pop
"
of
another
cycle
,
and
turn
<EOS>
,
see
to
my
satisfaction
the
man
Goldstein
,
who
have
evidently
see
the
aeroplane
,
and
be
now
bent
upon
obtain
all
detail
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
go
up
the
hill
I
draw
away
from
him
,
but
as
we
descend
he
pass
me
,
and
in
order
to
pose
as
an
excited
onlooker
,
I
shout
to
him
my
surprise
in
see
such
an
apparatus
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
He
evidently
know
more
of
the
new
invention
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
and
yet
Ray
hold
aloof
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
,
have
be
out
for
a
stroll
,
I
return
to
the
hotel
about
noon
,
when
a
few
moment
later
my
friend
enter
the
reading
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
's
go
to
your
room
<EOS>
,
"
he
suggest
;
therefore
we
ascend
the
stair
,
and
I
open
the
door
with
my
key
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
have
do
so
,
he
make
a
swift
tour
of
the
apartment
,
examine
both
the
carpet
and
the
red
plush
-
cover
chair
without
utter
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
stand
in
the
centre
of
the
room
for
a
moment
,
and
slowly
select
a
cigarette
from
his
case
.
<EOS>
Ray
Raymond
be
think
--
think
deeply
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
friend
Goldstein
have
a
visitor
,
"
he
remark
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
to
my
knowledge
,
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
occupy
room
no
.
11
in
this
hotel
,
"
he
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
16
,
therefore
he
must
be
quite
near
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
who
be
the
visitor
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
friend
of
Goldstein
's
.
<EOS>
downstairs
you
can
discover
his
name
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
descend
and
find
that
on
the
previous
evening
there
have
certainly
arrive
at
the
hotel
a
Mr.
William
Smith
,
who
occupy
room
<EOS>
no
.
11
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
be
Ray
aware
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
return
to
my
room
,
and
find
him
stare
out
of
the
window
into
the
roadway
below
.
<EOS>
I
see
that
he
be
unusually
agitate
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Jack
,
"
he
say
,
turn
to
me
when
I
tell
him
the
name
of
the
occupant
of
no
.
11
,
"
how
horribly
stuffy
this
room
be
!
<EOS>
do
you
never
have
the
window
open
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
,
"
I
say
,
cross
to
open
it
as
usual
.
<EOS>
but
I
find
that
it
have
be
jam
down
tightly
,
and
that
feel
have
be
place
in
the
crevice
by
the
hotel
people
to
exclude
the
draught
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
notice
it
,
and
a
curious
smile
cross
his
aquiline
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
remove
all
that
,
if
I
be
you
,
"
he
exclaim
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
would
also
pull
out
all
that
stuffing
<EOS>
I
see
up
the
chimney
.
<EOS>
You
never
have
a
fire
here
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hate
a
fire
in
my
bedroom
,
"
I
answer
.
<EOS>
"
but
what
have
that
to
do
with
our
friend
Goldstein
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
good
deal
,
"
be
his
reply
.
<EOS>
"
take
my
advice
and
have
a
fire
here
;
"
and
by
his
look
I
see
that
he
have
discover
more
than
he
wish
at
that
juncture
to
tell
me
.
<EOS>
have
I
know
the
astounding
truth
,
I
certainly
should
not
have
take
his
word
so
calmly
.
 
<EOS>
He
appear
to
evince
an
interest
in
my
room
,
its
position
and
its
content
,
but
when
I
remark
upon
it
he
pretend
unconcern
.
<EOS>
He
ring
the
bell
and
inquire
of
the
waiter
for
Mr.
Goldstein
and
Mr.
William
Smith
,
but
the
man
inform
him
that
both
gentleman
be
out
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
"
add
the
waiter
,
"
that
Mr.
Goldstein
be
leave
us
this
evening
or
to
-
morrow
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
leave
!
"
<EOS>
I
echo
as
soon
as
the
man
have
close
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
follow
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
It
really
be
not
worth
while
,
"
Ray
reply
,
"
at
least
not
just
at
present
.
<EOS>
remain
here
and
have
a
care
of
yourself
,
Jack
.
"
 
<EOS>
what
do
he
mean
?
<EOS>
We
eat
a
hasty
lunch
,
and
then
,
mount
into
the
car
,
my
companion
order
the
chauffeur
to
drive
south
again
past
Dulnan
Bridge
to
Duthil
,
where
we
turn
up
to
the
right
and
ascend
the
thickly
woode
hill
of
Lochgorm
on
that
stony
road
that
lead
out
upon
the
desolate
muir
of
Cromdale
.
<EOS>
after
we
have
clear
the
wood
he
order
the
man
to
pull
up
,
for
the
road
be
so
bad
.
<EOS>
descend
,
we
climb
the
steep
ascent
to
the
summit
of
a
hill
,
where
,
after
sweep
the
surround
country
with
a
small
pair
of
powerful
glass
I
carry
,
I
at
last
discern
the
aeroplane
head
westward
some
ten
mile
distant
.
 
<EOS>
unfortunately
,
however
,
the
cloud
come
down
upon
us
,
and
we
quickly
find
ourselves
envelop
in
a
gradually
thicken
Scotch
mist
,
while
the
aeroplane
,
soon
but
a
faint
grey
shadow
,
quickly
fade
from
our
gaze
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
Raymond
be
ever
a
dog
person
.
<EOS>
He
decide
to
descend
,
and
this
we
do
,
pass
over
the
other
side
of
the
hill
for
half
an
hour
,
progress
of
course
be
slow
on
account
of
the
cloud
.
 
<EOS>
presently
a
puff
of
cold
wind
come
up
out
of
the
east
,
and
patch
of
dun
-
colour
moorland
begin
to
appear
below
through
the
rent
of
the
fast
-
break
cloud
;
when
presently
our
watchful
eye
catch
the
dull
leaden
gleam
of
a
sheet
of
water
about
three
mile
ahead
,
which
a
look
at
my
map
enable
me
to
recognise
as
Lochindorb
.
 
<EOS>
and
just
as
we
be
able
to
locate
the
spot
we
again
see
the
big
white
-
wing
aeroplane
as
she
swoop
down
to
the
surface
of
the
loch
,
upon
which
she
float
swanlike
and
majestic
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
?
"
I
ask
,
turn
and
look
him
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
Jack
,
I
have
see
it
in
flight
just
as
you
have
,
"
he
say
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
never
yet
approach
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
reason
for
keep
away
.
<EOS>
after
to
-
day
,
however
,
there
be
no
longer
much
necessity
for
hesitation
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
follow
you
,
old
chap
,
"
I
declare
,
my
eye
still
fix
through
the
glass
upon
the
aeroplane
sailing
along
the
surface
of
the
distant
lake
.
 
<EOS>
"
probably
not
,
"
he
laugh
,
"
but
you
will
see
the
motive
of
my
action
before
a
few
day
be
over
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
let
's
go
back
.
"
<EOS>
and
return
to
the
car
he
carry
me
as
far
as
the
entrance
to
Grantown
,
where
he
deposit
me
,
and
then
turn
,
order
the
man
to
drive
with
all
speed
back
to
Kingussie
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
re
-
enter
my
comfortable
hotel
<EOS>
I
learn
that
Goldstein
have
leave
by
the
afternoon
train
for
the
south
.
<EOS>
My
interest
therefore
lie
in
the
new
arrival
in
No
.
11
,
but
though
I
wait
up
till
midnight
,
he
do
not
return
.
 
<EOS>
just
as
I
be
return
to
bed
I
make
a
curious
discovery
in
my
room
.
<EOS>
run
from
the
top
of
the
high
,
old
-
fashioned
mahogany
wardrobe
,
with
its
heavily
ornamented
cornice
,
be
a
long
piece
of
strong
,
black
cord
,
which
,
pass
down
the
side
panel
,
be
place
close
to
the
wainscoting
,
so
as
to
avoid
notice
,
the
end
be
place
beneath
the
mat
outside
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
at
once
I
suspect
a
practical
joke
,
but
on
mount
one
of
the
old
-
fashioned
chair
,
I
look
along
the
top
of
the
wardrobe
,
but
discern
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
gather
up
the
piece
of
cord
,
hold
it
in
my
hand
with
curiosity
for
a
few
moment
,
and
then
wonder
who
have
any
object
in
play
such
a
prank
,
turn
in
and
sleep
soundly
till
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
scarcely
sit
down
to
breakfast
in
the
small
upstairs
coffee
-
room
--
which
be
use
in
winter
--
when
I
be
summon
to
the
telephone
,
where
Ray
predict
that
the
mysterious
Mr.
Smith
would
soon
return
,
and
if
he
do
,
I
be
to
betray
no
interest
in
him
whatsoever
,
and
above
all
,
avoid
any
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
such
instruction
mystify
me
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
not
long
to
wait
for
the
return
of
the
man
who
call
himself
Smith
,
for
he
arrive
just
as
it
be
grow
dusk
.
 
<EOS>
after
dinner
I
be
seat
in
front
of
the
blaze
fire
in
my
room
,
smoking
and
read
the
_
Courier
_
,
when
I
hear
a
man
in
heavy
boot
pass
my
door
,
and
recognise
his
low
,
hack
cough
as
that
of
the
occupant
of
no
.
11
.
 
<EOS>
I
open
the
door
,
and
peer
forth
see
that
he
be
dressed
in
his
loose
mackintosh
and
cap
and
carry
a
stout
stick
.
<EOS>
He
be
go
forth
for
a
night
walk
!
 
<EOS>
therefore
I
slip
on
my
thick
boot
and
coat
and
follow
.
<EOS>
He
have
turn
to
the
right
on
leave
the
hotel
,
but
in
the
silence
of
the
night
it
be
difficult
,
nay
,
almost
impossible
,
to
watch
his
movement
unobserved
.
 
<EOS>
for
about
two
mile
I
go
forward
,
follow
the
sound
of
his
footstep
in
the
dark
night
in
the
direction
of
Dava
Moor
,
until
we
enter
the
forest
of
Glaschoile
,
where
the
footstep
suddenly
cease
.
 
<EOS>
I
halt
to
listen
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
dead
silence
.
<EOS>
the
man
have
realise
that
he
be
be
follow
,
and
have
plunge
into
the
forest
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
disappoint
,
I
be
compel
to
retrace
my
step
to
the
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
to
telephone
to
Ray
,
but
be
tell
that
late
the
previous
night
he
have
go
out
on
the
car
and
have
not
return
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
I
remain
there
,
impatient
and
helpless
,
the
mysterious
Smith
be
still
absent
.
 
<EOS>
at
three
o'clock
that
afternoon
the
car
pull
up
before
the
door
and
Ray
descend
.
 
<EOS>
"
put
on
your
coat
and
come
with
me
,
"
he
say
briefly
.
<EOS>
and
a
few
minute
later
we
be
tear
along
over
the
same
road
which
the
mysterious
Smith
have
take
in
the
darkness
--
the
direct
road
which
lead
north
by
way
of
Dava
,
away
to
Forres
.
 
<EOS>
just
past
the
little
school
house
of
Dava
we
leave
the
main
road
,
and
strike
across
the
wide
,
bleak
,
snow
-
cover
moor
for
about
a
mile
,
suddenly
come
into
view
of
a
wide
and
lonely
expanse
of
dark
water
in
the
centre
of
the
desolate
landscape
.
<EOS>
It
be
Lochindorb
,
where
,
in
the
distance
,
we
have
see
the
Kershaw
aeroplane
alight
and
sail
along
the
surface
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
reach
the
edge
of
the
loch
I
see
out
upon
a
small
islet
in
the
centre
a
ruin
castle
,
a
long
,
almost
unbroken
,
grey
wall
of
uniform
height
,
without
turret
or
battlement
,
occupy
the
whole
of
the
islet
.
<EOS>
below
the
wall
a
few
bush
grow
from
the
water
's
edge
,
but
it
be
as
dreary
and
isolate
a
spot
as
I
have
ever
see
.
<EOS>
beyond
stretch
the
big
,
dull
sheet
of
water
,
back
only
by
the
low
,
unintereste
moorland
,
the
only
break
in
the
all
-
pervade
flatness
and
monotony
be
afford
by
a
few
wind
-
stunt
tree
on
the
right
of
the
road
,
and
a
small
dark
plantation
ahead
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
car
have
stop
and
we
have
get
out
and
walk
a
few
yard
,
Ray
say
:
 
"
Yonder
be
the
old
castle
of
Lochindorb
,
Jack
.
<EOS>
behind
those
wall
be
the
shed
which
shelter
the
Kershaw
aeroplane
.
<EOS>
look
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
gaze
in
the
direction
he
indicate
,
I
see
a
skiff
with
three
occupant
come
across
from
the
shadow
on
the
left
towards
the
island
.
<EOS>
the
man
steering
be
a
corporal
of
engineer
in
khaki
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
appear
,
"
Ray
go
on
,
"
that
the
machine
take
her
flight
from
the
open
surface
of
the
loch

his

discover
at
the
eleventh
hour
,
my
friend
read
aloud
the
spy
's
report
,
as
follow
:
      
<EOS>
"
the
upper
plane
of
the
Kershaw
aeroplane
be
somewhat
curved
,
     
with
an
upward
curve
at
the
front
.
<EOS>
the
side
plane
be
compose
     
of
a
light
framework
cover
with
a
number
of
small
square
of
     
some
light
material
,
each
stretch
on
a
light
frame
hinge
to
     
the
main
frame
at
the
rear
end
of
each
.
<EOS>
to
the
front
end
be
     
fasten
a
strong
silken
cord
.
<EOS>
these
cord
be
all
fasten
at
     
their
low
end
to
a
large
ring
.
<EOS>
to
this
be
attach
a
wire
     
rope
,
which
pass
over
a
pulley
-
wheel
at
the
end
of
a
specie
     
of
outrigger
,
and
thence
into
the
cigar
-
like
body
of
the
car
.
     
<EOS>
from
what
I
have
observe
when
the
machine
be
in
flight
,
it
be
     
evident
to
me
that
the
steersman
(
who
sit
at
the
fore
part
of
     
the
car
)
be
able
to
manipulate
these
by
mean
of
lever
,
<EOS>
so
     
that
the
numerous
flap
form
the
surface
of
the
side
plane
     
can
be
open
and
close
at
will
.
      
<EOS>
"
thus
suppose
the
machine
to
be
diving
;
slacken
these
rope
,
     
the
pressure
of
the
air
underneath
cause
the
flap
to
open
.
<EOS>
as
     
soon
as
this
happen
their
inclination
upwards
tend
to
make
     
the
machine
rise
so
long
as
the
propeller
be
drive
her
     
forward
,
the
angle
of
ascent
be
control
by
the
angle
to
     
which
they
be
allow
to
open
.
<EOS>
if
the
machine
incline
to
lean
     
over
to
right
or
leave
,
the
opening
and
closing
of
the
flap
on
one
     
side
or
the
other
can
be
use
to
counteract
it
and
restore
the
     
balance

<EOS>
with
all
keep
tightly
closed

she
can
go

turn
up

to

enter

up

with
his

cut
a

<EOS>
over
that
he
,
as
you

place
several
thickness

attach
to

carry
it
outside

<EOS>
after
that
they
plug
up
your

chimney

so
that
when
you
be
asleep
all
they
have
to
do
be
to
just
pull
the
string
,
which
would
strip
off
the
plaster
,
allow
the
gas
to
escape
into

the
North
Sea
will
endeavour
to
filch
the
secret
from
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
agree
,
"
he
certainly
ought
to
be
warn
of
his
danger
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Hartmann
see
the
announcement
in
the
paper
,
there
be
certain
to
be
a
desperate
attempt
to
get
hold
of
the
secret
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
must
not
be
allow
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
Ray
exclaim
.
"
<EOS>
with
such
steel
as
this
the
british
Navy
will
have
a
splendid
and
distinct
advantage
over
that
of
our
friend
'
William
the
Sudden
.
'
<EOS>
this
be
a
great
and
important
secret
which
England
must
keep
at
all
hazard
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
"
declare
Vera
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
really
,
Ray
,
you
ought
to
see
Professor
Emden
and
have
a
chat
with
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
His
address
be
give
at
Richmond
,
"
be
my
friend
's
reply
,
"
but
I
have
to
go
up
to
Selkirk
early
to
-
morrow
,
and
shall
be
away
nearly
a
week
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
shall
I
run
down
and
see
him
this
evening
?
<EOS>
"
I
suggest
.
<EOS>
and
agree
with
my
idea
,
he
write
the
address
for
me
.
<EOS>
then
we
make
a
cup
of
tea
for
Vera
,
who
always
delight
in
the
rough
-
and
-
ready
bachelordom
of
a
barrister
's
chamber
.
<EOS>
afterwards
Ray
take
his
fiancee
home
to
her
aunt
's
,
while
I
go
back
to
my
rather
dismal
lodging
in
Guilford
Street
,
Russell
Square
.
 
<EOS>
at
nine
o'clock
that
evening
I
ring
at
a
pleasant
,
good
-
sized
,
modern
house
,
which
overlook
the
beautiful
Terrace
Gardens
and
the
river
lie
deep
below
at
Richmond
--
a
house
which
,
perhaps
,
command
the
fine
view
within
twenty
mile
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
the
door
be
upon
that
main
road
which
lead
from
the
town
up
to
the
"
Star
and
Garter
,
"
but
the
frontage
face
the
Gardens
.
<EOS>
the
dark
-
eyed
maid
who
open
the
door
inform
me
that
the
Professor
be
at
home
,
and
take
my
card
upstairs
.
<EOS>
then
,
a
few
moment
later
,
I
be
usher
up
to
a
cosy
den
,
the
study
of
a
studious
man
,
where
I
find
the
distinguished
scientist
stand
in
expectation
,
with
his
back
to
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
strange
-
looking
man
of
sixty
-
five
,
his
hair
unusually
white
and
slightly
bald
on
top
.
<EOS>
tall
beyond
the
average
,
he
wear
a
moustache
and
slight
pointed
beard
,
while
his
countenance
seem
very
broad
in
the
forehead
taper
to
a
point
.
<EOS>
His
face
be
,
indeed
,
almost
grotesque
.
 
<EOS>
I
commence
by
apologise
for
my
intrusion
,
but
explain
that
I
have
call
on
a
purely
confidential
matter
.
<EOS>
when
the
door
be
closed
,
and
we
be
alone
,
I
say
:
 
"
<EOS>
My
mission
,
Professor
,
be
a
somewhat
curious
one
"
;
and
I
go
on
to
explain
our
fear
that
german
secret
agent
may
obtain
knowledge
of
the
new
process
to
which
he
have
refer
at
the
London
Institution
on
the
previous
night
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
moment
he
stroke
his
pointed
white
beard
thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
I
detect
that
he
be
as
eccentric
as
he
be
curious
-
look
.
<EOS>
then
,
with
a
light
laugh
,
he
reply
:
 
"
really
Mr.--Mr
.
<EOS>
Jacox
,
I
can
not
see
your
motive
,
or
that
of
your
friend
,
in
thus
interfere
in
my
private
affair
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
be
not
this
splendid
discovery
of
yours
of
national
importance
?
<EOS>
"
I
protest
.
<EOS>
"
Will
it
not
give
us
an
enormous
advantage
over
our
enemy
?
<EOS>
therefore
,
be
it
not
more
than
probable
that
you
have
already
attract
the
attention
of
these
spy
of
Germany
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
sir
,
"
he
laugh
,
"
I
tell
you
quite
frankly
that
I
do
not
believe
in
all
these
story
about
german
spy
.
<EOS>
what
be
there
in
England
for
Germany
to
discover
?
<EOS>
nothing
;
they
know
everything
.
<EOS>
no
,
Mr.
Jacox
,
I
be
an
Englishman
,
a
patriot
,
and
I
still
believe
in
England
's
power
.
<EOS>
We
have
nothing
whatever
to
fear
from
Germany
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
theory
be
hardly
bear
out
by
fact
,
Professor
,
"
I
say
,
proceed
to
tell
him
of
our
discovery
at
Rosyth
,
and
how
we
have
outwit
the
spy
regard
the
new
submarine
,
and
also
the
airship
at
Lochindorb
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
strange
-
look
old
scientist
,
distinguish
as
he
be
,
only
laugh
my
fear
to
scorn
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
like
to
see
any
german
try
to
learn
my
secret
,
"
he
say
defiantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
would
urge
you
to
take
every
precaution
.
<EOS>
these
agent
employ
by
the
german
Secret
Police
on
behalf
of
the
General
Staff
be
bold
and
unscrupulous
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
do
you
allege
that
there
be
actually
german
spy
in
England
?
"
ask
the
strange
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
most
certainly
.
<EOS>
We
have
in
England
and
Scotland
more
than
five
thousand
fix
agent
,
man
of
almost
every
nationality
except
German
,
and
in
every
walk
of
life
,
from
humble
labourer
to
man
and
woman
in
good
position
,
all
of
whom
be
collect
information
at
the
order
of
the
german
travel
agent
,
who
visit
them
from
time
to
time
,
collect
their
report
,
and
pay
them
their
salary
.
<EOS>
french
,
Swiss
,
and
Italians
be
mostly
employ
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
at
the
present
time
my
friend
Raymond
have
under
observation
a
german
band
,
seven
young
fellow
all
army
officer
,
who
be
play
in
the
street
of
Leeds
,
and
at
the
same
time
make
a
secret
map
of
the
water
-
main
of
that
city
,
in
order
that
when
'
the
Day
'
of
invasion
come
,
the
enemy
will
be
able
to
suddenly
deprive
a
densely
populated
area
of
water
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
have
you
any
actual
proof
of
this
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
speak
the
door
open
,
and
there
enter
a
pretty
dark
-
haired
girl
of
twenty
-
two
,
wear
a
light
skirt
and
a
pale
pink
evening
blouse
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
dad
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
,
halt
suddenly
,
"
I
be
sorry
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
you
have
a
visitor

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
be
a
moment
,
Nella
dear
,
"
the
curious
-
look
old
man
say
,
and
after
a
quick
,
inquisitive
glance
at
me
the
girl
withdraw
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
exclaim
the
Professor
,
with
a
smile
,
"
I
be
really
very
obliged
to
you
for
trouble
to
come
here
to
warn
me
,
but
<EOS>
I
think
,
my
dear
sir
,
that
warning
be
quite
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
slight
fear
that
any
attempt
will
ever
be
make
to
secure
my
secret
"
;
and
he
rise
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
I
reply
,
shrug
my
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
warn
you
,
Professor
Emden
.
<EOS>
the
Government
will
not
admit
the
presence
of
spy
amongst
us
,
and
for
that
reason
we
be
now
collect
indisputable
evidence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
laugh
,
"
and
you
want
me
to
help
you
,
eh
?
<EOS>
well
,
sir
,
I
do
not
believe
in
a
word
of
this
scare
--
so
I
must
decline
that
honour
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
you
will
take
no
unusual
precaution
to
keep
the
truth
out
of
the
hand
of
our
enemy

eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
leave
it
to
Joynson
's
of
Sheffield
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
pay
me
a
large
sum
down
and
a
royalty
for
the
secret
of
my
process

it
be
scarcely
likely
that
they
will
allow
it
to
fall
into
other
hand

it
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
will
not
,
but
you
,
a
private
individual
,
may
,
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
"
he
laugh
,
and
a
moment
later
I
descend
the
stair
,
pass
his
pretty
daughter
Nella
on
the
way
out
.
 
<EOS>
that
night
I
call
on
Ray
at
Bruton
Street
,
but
he
be
out
at
the
theatre
with
Vera
.
<EOS>
at
half
-
past
eleven
they
call
as
they
go
back
to
the
girl
's
aunt
's
,
and
as
they
sit
before
the
fire
,
Vera
with
her
opera
-
cloak
throw
back
reveal
a
pretty
pale
blue
corsage
a
trifle
<EOS>
_
decollete
_
<EOS>
,
I
report
the
non
-
success
of
my
mission
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
pig
-
head
old
ass
!
<EOS>
"
I
declare
.
<EOS>
"
one
of
million
of
other
in
England
.
<EOS>
They
close
their
eye
to
the
danger
of
this
horde
of
spy
among
us
,
and
will
only
open
them
when
the
Germans
come
march
up
the
street
and
billet
themselves
in
their
house
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
a
strange
man
,
Ray
,
a
very
strange
man
,
"
I
add
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
right
,
Mr.
Jacox
,
"
the
girl
declare
.
"
<EOS>
instead
of
teach
boy
how
to
scout
and
instruct
young
man
in
the
use
of
popgun
,
we
should
strike
first
at
the
root
of
all
thing
.
<EOS>
cut
off
the
source
of
this
secret
information
which
daily
go
across
the
North
Sea
.
<EOS>
such
hidebound
patriot
as
the
Professor
be
a
peril
to
the
nation
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
he
refuse
to
help
himself
,
Jacox
,
we
must
protect
him
ourselves
,
"
Ray
declare
.
<EOS>
"
I
leave
it
to
you
and
Vera
to
keep
an
open
eye
until
I
return
from
Selkirk
next
Monday
.
<EOS>
I
be
bind
to
go
down
and
see
my
sister
.
<EOS>
She
seem
very
ill
indeed
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
so
a
very
important
and
delicate
affair
be
thus
place
in
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Vera
Vallance
announce
herself
ready
and
eager
to
assist
me
,
and
that
night
I
walk
back
to
bloomsbury
much
puzzle
how
next
to
act
.
 
<EOS>
that
the
Germans
would
attempt
to
secure
the
secret
of
the
new
steel
be
absolutely
certain
.
<EOS>
but
to
us
,
success
mean
the
keeping
of
it
to
Britain
,
and
the
armouring
of
our
new
_
Dreadnoughts
_
with
a
resist
power
eight
time
that
of
our
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
I
journey
down
to
Sheffield
and
call
upon
the
manager
of
Messrs.
Joynson
and
Mackinder
,
the
great
steel
-
maker
,
who
,
as
you
know
,
hold
the
contract
for
make
the
armour
-
plate
of
our
improve
_
Dreadnoughts
_
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
how
the
firm
have
just
construct
six
of
the
new
Emden
electrical
furnace
,
and
have
also
take
over
the
wonderful
new
process
which
the
Professor
have
invent
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
courteously
take
me
across
to
that
portion
of
the
great
grimy
work
,
with
its
wonderful
steel
melting
and
refining
furnace
,
to
where
the
Emden
process
be
about
to
be
carry
out
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
have
no
fear
of
the
new
method
be
learn
by
any
of
your
rival
--
by
any
german
firm
,
for
instance
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
in
the
least
,
"
laugh
the
manager
,
a
bluff
,
grey
-
bearded
man
,
speak
in
his
broad
Hallamshire
dialect
;
"
we
take
good
care
of
that
.
<EOS>
each
workman
only
do
a
part
,
the
whole
of
the
process
be
only
know
to
myself
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
do
for
us
to
give
Professor
Emden
forty
thousand
pound
for
the
secret
and
then
allow
it
to
fall
into
foreign
hand
.
<EOS>
the
Germans
would
,
of
course
,
give
anything
for
it
,
"
he
add
.
<EOS>
"
Emden
be
a
patriotic
Englishman
even
though
he
be
very
eccentric
,
and
if
he
like
he
could
have
get
almost
anything
he
care
to
ask
from
Krupp
's
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
just
the
point
,
"
I
say
;
and
then
,
as
we
walk
back
to
the
office
,
I
explain
my
fear
.
<EOS>
but
,
like
the
Professor
himself
,
he
only
laugh
them
to
scorn
.
<EOS>
so
that
evening
I
again
return
to
London
fill
with
anxiety
and
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
just
before
eleven
that
same
night
I
stroll
past
the
house
of
Hermann
Hartmann
,
in
Pont
Street
,
vaguely
wonder
what
I
could
do
to
prevent
a
theft
which
must
,
I
know
,
shortly
be
commit
.
<EOS>
in
all
probability
the
ingenious
Hartmann
already
have
a
secret
agent
in
Joynson
's
work
,
but
even
if
he
have
,
he
would
certainly
not
be
able
to
discover
the
secret
.
<EOS>
I
have
quite
satisfy
myself
upon
that
point
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
the
peril
lie
in
the
Professor
himself
--
the
strange
old
pig
-
head
patriot
.
 
<EOS>
scarcely
have
I
pass
Hartmann
's
house
,
the
exterior
of
which
I
know
so
<EOS>
well
,
when
I
hear
the
front
door
close
and
see
a
man
come
down
the
step
.
<EOS>
as
he
walk
in
my
direction
I
halt
beneath
a
lamp
to
light
a
cigarette
,
and
by
so
do
<EOS>
I
obtain
a
glimpse
of
his
face
as
he
pass
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
young
,
good
-
looking
,
smartly
dressed
man
,
with
dark
eye
and
hair
and
a
rather
sallow
complexion
.
<EOS>
I
put
him
down
to
be
an
Italian
,
but
I
have
never
set
eye
upon
him
before
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
he
be
one
of
Hartmann
's
travel
agent
--
a
man
who
go
up
and
down
England
visit
the
fix
spy
of
Germany
,
or
"
letter
-
box
,
"
as
they
be
know
in
the
bureau
of
secret
police
in
Berlin
--
collect
their
report
and
make
payment
for
information
or
service
render
.
 
<EOS>
know
<EOS>
so
much
of
the
way
of
the
german
secret
agent
,
curiosity
prompt
me
to
follow
him
.
<EOS>
He
stroll
as
far
as
the
corner
of
Sloane
Street
and
Knightsbridge
,
and
then
board
a
motor
-
bus
as
far
as
Piccadilly
Circus
.
<EOS>
Thence
<EOS>
he
walk
to
the
german
beer
-
hall
,
the
Gambrinus
,
just
off
Coventry
Street
,
where
he
join
a
tall
,
thin
,
grey
-
moustached
man
,
an
Italian
like
himself
,
who
be
seat
await
him
.
<EOS>
I
idle
across
to
a
table
close
by
,
call
for
beer
,
and
sit
smoke
a
cigarette
and
strain
my
ear
to
catch
their
conversation
,
which
be
in
Italian
,
a
language
I
know
fairly
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
discover
the
follow
fact
.
<EOS>
the
thin
-
faced
man
be
call
Giovanni
,
while
the
elegant
young
fellow
be
Uberto
,
and
they
be
discuss
the
arrival
of
somebody
.
<EOS>
Giovanni
seem
dubious
about
something
,
while
the
man
who
have
leave
Hartmann
's
seem
enthusiastic
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
Uberto
glance
at
his
watch
,
make
some
remark
to
his
companion
,
and
they
rise
and
go
out
together
,
drive
in
a
taxicab
westward
<EOS>
,
I
follow
in
another
,
which
I
fortunately
find
just
in
time
.
<EOS>
through
Kensington
we
go
,
over
Hammersmith
Bridge
,
through
Barnes
,
and
across
the
Common
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
realise
we
be
go
to
Richmond
.
 
<EOS>
the
chase
grow
exciting
.
<EOS>
before
me
I
could
see
the
red
back
-
lamp
of
the
taxi
as
it
speed
forward
,
and
half
an
hour
later
we
be
cross
Richmond
Bridge
,
where
,
a
short
distance
along
the
road
to
Twickenham
,
they
suddenly
swing
round
to
the
left
into
St.
Margaret
's
and
pull
up
before
a
good
-
sized
detached
house
which
stand
back
in
its
own
ground
,
in
which
be
several
big
tree
.
<EOS>
the
thoroughfare
be
,
I
note
,
call
Brunswick
road
.
 
<EOS>
My
taxi
-
driver
prove
himself
no
fool
.
<EOS>
I
have
tell
him
to
follow
;
therefore
,
unable
to
pull
up
sharply
,
he
sweep
past
,
and
do
not
stop
until
we
be
round
the
bend
in
the
quiet
suburban
road
and
thus
out
of
sight
.
 
<EOS>
I
order
him
to
remain
,
and
,
alighting
,
stroll
back
past
the
house
in
question
.
<EOS>
about
its
dark
exterior
be
a
distinct
air
of
mystery
.
<EOS>
the
pair
have
enter
,
and
the
taxi
be
await
them
.
<EOS>
the
house
be
an
old
-
fashioned
one
,
solid
and
substantial
in
character
,
and
apparently
the
residence
of
some
prosperous
City
man
;
yet
I
wonder
why
its
owner
should
have
visitor
at
that
hour
.
<EOS>
surely
great
urgency
have
compel
the
pair
to
come
all
the
way
from
Piccadilly
Circus
to
consult
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
a
surprise
be
in
store
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
after
lurk
about
in
the
shadow
with
that
expert
evasiveness
which
I
have
now
acquire
,
I
presently
see
the
pair
make
their
exit
,
but
,
to
my
surprise
,
they
be
accompany
out
to
the
kerb
by
a
woman
--
apparently
a
lady
in
black
evening
dress
,
the
bodice
of
which
be
cut
low
.
 
<EOS>
about
her
shoulder
she
have
wrap
a
pale
blue
shawl
,
and
as
the
young
Uberto
enter
the
taxi
I
hear
her
exclaim
in
Italian
:
 
<EOS>
"
_
Addio
!
<EOS>
_
To
-
morrow
at
one
then
,
at
Prince
's
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
as
she
move
I
see
her
countenance
by
the
light
of
the
cab
lamp
,
a
handsome
,
well
-
cut
face
,
typical
of
a
woman
of
Piedmont
,
for
she
have
speak
in
a
dialect
unmistakably
that
of
Turin
.
<EOS>
the
Turinese
be
more
french
than
italian
,
and
be
as
different
in
both
temperament
and
language
from
those
of
the
south
as
the
people
of
the
Ardennes
differ
from
those
of
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
both
man
shake
hand
with
her
warmly
,
bade
her
"
_
Addio
_
,
"
and
enter
the
taxi
,
drive
away
back
to
London
,
while
I
stand
still
watch
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
I
gaze
I
see
as
she
walk
back
to
the
house
,
in
the
doorway
,
silhouette
against
the
light
,
an
old
man
come
forward
towards
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
_
Dio
!
_
<EOS>
"
she
cry
,
half
in
alarm
at
see
him
.
<EOS>
then
in
Italian
,
she
add
,
"
why
do
you
risk
be
see
,
you
imbecile
?
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
keep
where
you
be
?
"
 
<EOS>
then
the
door
close
,
and
seek
my
taxi
<EOS>
I
also
return
to
Bloomsbury
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
incident
have
arouse
a
good
deal
of
doubt
and
suspicion
within
me
.
<EOS>
who
be
that
handsome
young
italian
woman
whom
the
spy
have
visit
at
that
late
hour
?
<EOS>
and
,
above
all
,
who
be
that
man
with
whom
she
have
be
annoy
for
show
himself
?
 
<EOS>
next
day
prove
conclusively
that
some
crooked
business
be
in
progress
,
for
while
I
sit
alone
eat
my
lunch
in
a
corner
of
the
big
room
at
Prince
's
Restaurant
in
Piccadilly
<EOS>
,
I
be
amazed
to
see
the
well
-
dress
young
Italian
--
the
man
whom
I
have
see
emerge
from
Hartmann
's
in
Pont
Street
,
enter
with
no
other
person
than
Nella
Emden
.
 
<EOS>
surely
the
spy
have
already
make
considerable
progress
!
<EOS>
My
indignation
be
such
that
I
could
have
walk
over
to
the
table
where
the
pair
have
seat
themselves
,
and
denounce
that
elegant
Italian
as
a
spy
of
the
Kaiser
.
<EOS>
but
I
foresaw
that
by
patience
I
may
yet
discover
more
that
would
be
of
interest
.
 
<EOS>
from
my
corner
I
watch
the
pair
unnoticed
.
<EOS>
the
girl
be
certainly
extremely
good
-
looking
,
young
,
and
by
her
manner
I
could
see
that
she
be
shy
at
be
with
a
male
companion
alone
in
a
public
restaurant
.
<EOS>
He
,
on
his
part
,
be
exercise
over
her
all
the
fascination
of
his
nation
.
<EOS>
once
or
twice
I
see
him
smile
covertly
across
behind
me
,
and
when
I
have
an
opportunity
to
glance
round
I
realise
,
to
my
surprise
,
that
the
man
whom
he
have
call
Giovanni
be
lunch
with
the
handsome
italian
woman
from
St.
Margaret
's
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
that
they
be
watch
the
young
pair
.
<EOS>
for
what
reason
,
I
wonder
?
 
<EOS>
I
remain
on
the
alert
,
but
that
day
discover
nothing
more
,
though
I
follow
the
young
pair
back
to
Richmond
and
see
the
italian
part
affectionately
from
Nella
Emden
near
her
father
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
for
some
day
I
prosecute
an
unceasing
vigil
,
for
already
I
have
recognise
the
seriousness
of
a
secret
fall
into
the
enemy
'
hand
which
would
undoubtedly
give
them
the
advantage
in
the
come
struggle
.
 
<EOS>
one
afternoon
Vera
Vallance
meet
me
at
Waterloo
Station
,
and
together
we
go
down
to
Richmond
,
where
I
show
her
the
Professor
's
house
,
and
together
we
wait
for
the
coming
of
Nella
.
<EOS>
Vera
,
enthusiastic
as
ever
,
and
ingenious
at
keep
observation
,
follow
the
girl
,
while
in
fear
of
be
recognise
I
go
back
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
she
call
at
New
Stone
Buildings
,
smart
,
neat
,
and
altogether
sweet
and
win
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
Mr.
Jacox
,
"
she
say
,
seat
herself
by
my
fire
,
"
I
have
a
curious
experience
after
I
leave
you
yesterday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Nella
go
first
by
tram
to
Twickenham
,
and
near
the
Town
Hall
there
meet
the
young
Italian
,
who
have
a
companion
--
Hartmann
himself
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Hartmann
!
<EOS>
"
I
gasp
.
"
<EOS>
then
our
suspicion
be
surely
well
ground
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
they
be
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
at
once
draw
back
,
fear
that
our
clever
friend
of
Pont
Street
should
notice
me
.
<EOS>
fortunately
he
do
not
,
therefore
I
be
able
to
watch
and
ascertain
where
they
go
--
to
the
house
in
St.
Margaret
's
where
you
see
that
italian
woman
.
<EOS>
They
apparently
stay
there
to
tea
,
for
about
half
-
past
five
<EOS>
the
young
man
come
out
and
walk
in
the
direction
of
Richmond
Bridge
.
<EOS>
I
,
however
,
remain
behind
,
and
though
I
wait
for
hour
,
until
long
after
dark
,
neither
Hartmann
nor
the
girl
make
their
reappearance
.
<EOS>
but
at
nine
a
very
remarkable
incident
occur
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
three
man
come
along
the
road
in
the
darkness
carry
something
.
<EOS>
when
they
draw
near
me
and
turn
into
the
gate
of
the
house
,
I
stand
aghast
.
<EOS>
upon
their
shoulder
be
a
coffin
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
coffin
!
<EOS>
"
I
echo
,
stare
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
and
though
I
wait
until
midnight
,
Hartmann
do
not
come
forth
,
neither
do
the
Professor
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
what
do
you
make
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
,
look
into
my
eye
.
 
<EOS>
I
admit
that
the
affair
be
a
mystery
,
and
suggest
that
we
may
ascertain
whether
Nella
have
return
to
her
home
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
go
down
to
Richmond
and
see
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
I
do
without
delay
.
<EOS>
I
watch
the
house
during
that
afternoon
,
and
just
at
dusk
see
the
dark
-
eyed
maid
-
servant
emerge
to
post
a
letter
.
<EOS>
I
follow
her
up
the
hill
to
the
pillar
-
box
,
and
by
the
application
of
a
couple
of
half
-
crown
obtain
some
information
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
sir
,
"
reply
the
girl
,
"
Miss
Nella
be
not
come
home
.
<EOS>
the
master
be
in
a
great
state
about
her
.
<EOS>
She
go
out
for
a
walk
yesterday
afternoon
,
and
though
he
be
be
to
the
police
,
nobody
seem
to
have
see
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
her
father
's
assistant
in
his
experiment
,
I
have
hear
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
she
be
.
<EOS>
ever
since
poor
Mrs.
Emden
die
,
two
year
ago
,
she
be
be
her
father
's
right
hand
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
have
she
a
lover
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well"--and
the
girl
hesitate
.
<EOS>
"
We
in
the
kitchen
have
our
suspicion
.
<EOS>
Davis
the
cook
see
her
last
Sunday
walk
over
in
Teddington
with
a
dark
young
man
,
who
look
like
a
foreigner
.
<EOS>
but
,
"
she
add
,
"
why
do
you
want
to
know
all
this
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
try
to
trace
the
young
lady
,
"
I
say
,
in
the
hope
that
she
would
believe
me
to
be
a
detective
.
"
<EOS>
tell
me
,
"
I
urge
;
"
do
the
Professor
make
any
experiment
at
home
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
,
sir
;
his
laboratory
be
up
on
the
top
floor
--
fit
up
with
an
electric
furnace
and
lot
of
funny
appliance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
have
he
any
friend
who
be
foreigner
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
that
I
know
of
,
"
be
the
girl
's
reply
.
<EOS>
and
I
think
she
regard
me
rather
strangely
.
<EOS>
why
,
I
could
not
conceive
.
<EOS>
Her
name
be
Annie
Whybrow
,
she
tell
me
,
and
then
,
unable
to
detain
her
longer
I
allow
her
to
re
-
enter
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Vera
's
story
of
the
coffin
be
take
into
that
mysterious
house
in
Brunswick
Road
,
combine
with
the
non
-
return
of
the
pretty
Nella
,
be
certainly
mystifying
.
 
<EOS>
I
return
to
London
,
see
Vera
,
and
we
resolve
to
wire
to
Ray
at
Selkirk
ask
him
to
return
to
London
as
soon
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
that
night
,
and
the
next
,
I
haunt
the
usual
resort
of
foreigner
in
the
West
End
,
the
underground
Cafe
de
l'Europe
,
the
Spaten
beer
-
hall
in
Leicester
Square
,
the
Cafe
Monico
,
the
Gambrinus
,
and
other
place
,
in
order
to
discover
the
young
Italian
.
<EOS>
on
the
second
evening
I
be
successful
,
for
I
see
him
in
the
Monico
,
and
on
inquire
of
a
man
I
know
,
I
learn
that
his
name
be
Uberto
Mellini
,
that
until
recently
he
have
live
in
Paris
,
and
that
at
the
present
moment
he
be
stay
in
a
house
in
Dean
Street
,
Soho
.
 
<EOS>
at
midnight
,
when
I
return
to
Bloomsbury
,
I
find
Vera
and
Ray
anxiously
await
me
.
<EOS>
the
latter
have
only
arrive
in
London
from
Scotland
an
hour
before
,
and
his
fiancee
have
evidently
tell
him
of
the
curious
event
which
have
transpire
and
the
sinister
mystery
surround
the
young
girl
's
disappearance
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
see
no
reason
for
it
at
all
,
"
he
declare
,
when
we
commence
to
discuss
the
situation
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
quite
plain
that
our
friend
the
enemy
be
actively
at
work
,
but
surely
the
fact
that
Nella
be
miss
would
put
the
Professor
upon
his
guard
.
<EOS>
this
young
Italian
Mellini
be
evidently
a
new
importation
,
and
have
pretend
to
form
an
attachment
for
Nella
for
some
ulterior
object
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
but
what
do
you
make
of
the
incident
of
the
coffin
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
have
be
no
funeral
from
that
house
in
Brunswick
Road
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
as
far
as
I
can
gather
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
Registrar
of
death
would
be
able
to
inform
us
,
"
he
say
reflectively
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
inquire
.
"
 
<EOS>
next
day
all
three
of
us
return
to
Richmond
,
and
while
Ray
and
Vera
cross
the
bridge
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
Thames
to
find
the
Registrar
's
office
,
I
linger
and
watch
in
the
vicinity
of
the
Professor
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
wait
for
many
weary
hour
in
the
wet
--
<EOS>
for
rain
fall
the
whole
day
--
but
Ray
do
not
return
,
which
cause
me
considerable
misgiving
.
<EOS>
I
be
compel
to
resort
to
all
sort
of
subterfuge
in
order
not
to
attract
attention
;
but
as
my
friend
have
direct
me
to
remain
and
watch
,
I
wait
patiently
at
my
post
.
 
<EOS>
just
after
the
street
lamp
be
light
,
a
telegraph
messenger
arrive
,
and
ten
minute
after
he
have
go
the
girl
Annie
come
out
with
hat
and
jacket
on
,
and
turn
to
the
left
hurry
in
my
direction
.
 
<EOS>
as
she
pass
I
speak
to
her
,
and
,
recognise
me
,
she
explain
that
she
be
go
for
a
cab
to
convey
the
Professor
to
the
station
.
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Nella
be
at
Liverpool
,
"
she
add
excitedly
.
<EOS>
"
the
master
have
have
a
wire
from
her
,
ask
him
to
go
there
at
once
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
ill
,
it
seem
.
<EOS>
the
poor
master
be
greatly
excited
.
<EOS>
He
be
just
telephone
to
the
police
say
that
Miss
Nella
have
be
find
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
the
girl
hurry
away
,
down
the
hill
to
the
foot
of
the
bridge
,
where
there
be
a
cab
-
stand
.
 
<EOS>
Nella
at
Liverpool
!
<EOS>
what
could
possibly
have
occur
?
 
<EOS>
later
on
I
watch
the
Professor
,
carry
only
a
handbag
,
enter
a
cab
and
drive
rapidly
to
the
station
,
while
Annie
return
to
the
house
and
close
the
front
door
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
then
about
six
o'clock
,
and
I
have
be
watch
there
for
nearly
eight
hour
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
decide
to
go
in
search
of
Ray
,
who
be
over
at
St.
Margaret
's
,
and
who
,
I
think
,
would
most
probably
be
watch
the
house
to
which
the
coffin
have
be
take
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
I
be
not
mistake
,
for
I
find
him
idle
at
the
end
of
that
quiet
,
dark
suburban
road
.
<EOS>
He
be
on
the
alert
the
instant
he
recognise
me
,
and
in
a
few
rapid
sentence
I
tell
him
what
have
occur
.
 
<EOS>
It
puzzle
him
greatly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
ascertain
that
Hartmann
be
back
at
Pont
Street
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
but
why
the
coffin
should
be
in
yonder
house
be
still
a
mystery
.
<EOS>
the
Registrar
have
have
no
intimation
of
any
death
in
Brunswick
Road
for
the
past
eight
month
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
however
,
find
the
local
undertaker
,
who
say
that
a
plain
coffin
be
order
for
a
gentleman
and
that
they
duly
deliver
it
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
see
the
body
,
be
tell
that
the
funeral
be
to
be
undertake
by
a
big
West
End
firm
,
and
that
the
body
be
to
be
convey
for
burial
somewhere
near
Leicester
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
find
out
anything
further
regard
the
occupant
of
the
house
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
only
that
it
be
take
furnish
by
a
gentleman
a
month
ago
--
a
foreigner
whose
description
exactly
tally
with
that
of
Hartmann
--
for
an
old
man
and
his
daughter
--
both
Italians
.
<EOS>
They
have
keep
themselves
very
much
to
themselves
,
therefore
the
neighbour
know
practically
nothing
about
their
business
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
Nella
Emden
be
entice
in
there
.
<EOS>
I
be
certain
of
that
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
yet
the
fact
that
she
be
in
Liverpool
rather
negative
my
first
theory
of
foul
play
,
"
I
add
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
but
we
must
still
remain
watchful
.
<EOS>
Vera
have
go
to
make
some
inquiry
for
me
over
at
Mortlake
.
<EOS>
I
expect
her
back
in
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
You
return
and
keep
a
watchful
eye
upon
the
Professor
's
place
.
<EOS>
one
never
know
what
crooked
business
may
be
on
hand
!
"
 
<EOS>
so
back
I
go
,
and
through
the
whole
evening
wait
there
,
chill
to
the
bone
,
in
vain
expectancy
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
notice
from
Ray
's
manner
that
he
have
become
very
suspicious
.
<EOS>
He
somehow
scent
the
presence
of
spy
at
time
when
,
I
confess
,
I
feel
calm
and
reassured
.
<EOS>
and
his
natural
intuition
be
seldom
,
if
ever
,
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
the
church
bell
across
the
river
have
chime
midnight
,
the
Professor
's
servant
have
put
out
the
light
and
retire
,
and
the
thoroughfare
be
now
desert
.
<EOS>
hungry
and
tired
out
,
I
be
contemplate
relax
my
vigil
when
Ray
suddenly
turn
a
corner
and
join
me
,
say
breathlessly
:
 
"
Uberto
and
his
friend
be
come
up
the
hill
with
another
man
.
<EOS>
Vera
and
I
have
see
them
call
at
Brunswick
Road
,
and
they
be
now
on
their
way
here
.
<EOS>
We
must
keep
a
strict
watch
.
<EOS>
something
be
up
!
"
 
<EOS>
We
separate
,
and
conceal
ourselves
in
the
basement
of
the
house
opposite
,
we
witness
that
which
cause
our
heart
-
beat
to
quicken
.
 
<EOS>
the
three
man
come
along
in
silence
in
the
night
,
for
they
evidently
wear
rubber
heel
on
their
boot
.
<EOS>
the
constable
be
then
some
distance
down
the
hill
,
therefore
they
pass
him
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
approach
the
house
,
the
man
whom
I
have
hear
address
as
Giovanni
hurry
forward
,
and
slip
suddenly
into
the
narrow
front
garden
,
approach
the
kitchen
window
.
<EOS>
insert
something
between
the
sash
,
he
push
back
the
latch
,
carefully
draw
back
the
blind
,
and
be
within
the
house
almost
before
the
two
other
have
enter
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
without
a
sound
,
the
pair
follow
him
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
three
spy
have
enter
the
premise
so
quickly
that
we
could
scarcely
believe
our
own
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
police
!
"
<EOS>
whisper
Ray
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
get
the
constable
.
<EOS>
slip
down
the
hill
and
tell
him
.
<EOS>
We
will
make
a
fine
capture
this
time
!
"
 
<EOS>
down
the
hill
I
speed
,
and
five
minute
later
be
back
with
the
constable
,
have
briefly
explain
to
him
our
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
anything
about
german
spy
,
sir
,
but
whoever
be
inside
be
liable
for
burglariously
enter
,
and
we
will
have
'
em
,
"
whisper
the
officer
.
 
<EOS>
silently
we
enter
just
as
the
spy
have
do
,
pass
through
the
kitchen
,
and
up
the
stair
.
<EOS>
the
laboratory
be
at
the
top
of
the
house
I
know
,
and
be
always
keep
lock
.
<EOS>
therefore
we
creep
forward
,
without
the
slight
sound
.
 
<EOS>
once
or
twice
,
we
listen
.
<EOS>
the
spy
be
absolutely
silent
--
well
train
to
that
sort
of
nocturnal
investigation
,
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
as
Ray
and
I
get
to
the
door
of
the
big
room
,
which
,
by
the
light
of
the
flash
-
lamp
use
by
the
intruder
,
we
could
see
be
fit
with
all
sort
of
appliance
,
we
witness
through
the
crack
that
they
have
secure
a
number
of
specimen
of
metal
and
be
all
three
at
that
moment
engage
in
drill
a
hole
in
the
big
dark
green
safe
standing
in
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
whisper
the
constable
,
"
let
's
rush
them
.
"
<EOS>
and
with
a
loud
shout
we
dash
in
upon
them
,
revolver
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
in
an
instant
we
be
in
total
darkness
.
<EOS>
deep
curse
in
Italian
sound
,
and
I
hear
a
desperate
struggle
take
place
.
<EOS>
somebody
grab
at
me
,
but
it
be
our
friend
the
constable
.
<EOS>
then
,
by
the
red
flash
of
a
revolver
which
somebody
fire
,
I
distinguish
the
flying
form
of
one
of
the
intruder
through
the
doorway
.
 
<EOS>
next
second
,
in
the
darkness
,
I
feel
a
man
brush
past
me
,
and
instantly
I
close
with
him
.
<EOS>
We
fall
together
,
and
as
I
grip
the
fellow
's
throat
he
ejaculate
a
loud
imprecation
in
Italian
.
<EOS>
then
we
roll
over
in
desperate
embrace
,
but
as
I
force
him
beneath
me
,
shout
to
the
constable
,
whose
lantern
have
be
knock
from
his
hand
and
break
,
I
suddenly
feel
a
crush
blow
upon
the
skull
.
<EOS>
I
see
a
thousand
star
,
and
then
the
blackness
of
unconsciousness
fall
upon
me
.
        
<EOS>
*
      
<EOS>
*
      
<EOS>
*
      
<EOS>
*
      
<EOS>
*
 
<EOS>
when
I
again
grow
cognisant
of
what
be
go
on
about
me
,
I
find
myself
lie
in
bed
in
the
Richmond
Cottage
Hospital
with
a
pleasant
-
face
nurse
bend
eagerly
over
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
still
night
,
for
the
gas
be
burn
.
 
<EOS>
She
ask
how
I
feel
,
remark
that
I
have
receive
a
nasty
crack
,
and
have
lain
there
unconscious
for
three
whole
day
.
 
<EOS>
presently
I
feel
the
presence
of
some
one
else
near
me
,
and
gradually
make
them
out
to
be
Ray
and
Vera
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
they
would
tell
me
nothing
,
but
after
the
doctor
have
see
me
,
Ray
in
his
cheery
way
say
:
 
"
Yours
be
a
bit
of
hard
luck
,
old
fellow
.
<EOS>
the
blackguard
all
get
away
--
all
three
of
them
.
<EOS>
but
we
be
just
in
time
,
for
in
that
safe
<EOS>
be
the
memoranda
of
the
Professor
's
experiment
which
,
together
with
the
specimen
of
the
new
metal
that
could
have
be
analyse
,
would
have
undoubtedly
place
the
secret
of
the
new
steel
in
the
hand
of
the
german
Admiralty
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
we
really
prevent
them
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
eagerly
,
feel
the
bandage
about
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
just
in
the
very
nick
of
time
,
old
man
,
"
he
reply
.
<EOS>
"
and
we
do
more
.
<EOS>
We
manage
to
save
Miss
Nella
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
?
"
<EOS>
I
inquire
eagerly
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
here
.
<EOS>
She
will
tell
you
herself
.
"
<EOS>
and
next
moment
I
see
her
standing
before
me
with
the
Professor
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
Mr.
Jacox
,
"
the
girl
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
to
thank
you
.
<EOS>
I
be
first
approach
by
the
young
italian
while
cross
Richmond
Bridge
one
day
,
and
later
on
he
introduce
me
to
his
sister
,
who
live
in
St.
Margaret
's
.
<EOS>
on
the
afternoon
when
I
be
induce
to
go
there
<EOS>
I
be
give
something
in
my
tea
which
at
once
render
me
unconscious
.
<EOS>
when
I
recover
,
I
find
myself
lie
in
a
coffin
secure
to
ring
inside
,
while
a
villainous
old
man
,
a
bearded
German
,
and
an
italian
woman
be
about
to
screw
down
the
lid
.
<EOS>
I
scream
,
but
they
take
no
notice
,
until
in
fear
I
faint
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
shall
I
ever
forget
those
horrible
moment
?
<EOS>
I
be
alone
,
helpless
in
the
hand
of
those
fiend
,
all
because
I
have
allow
myself
to
become
attract
by
a
stranger
!
<EOS>
They
hold
me
there
for
day
,
try
to
learn
from
me
the
secret
of
my
father
's
discovery
.
<EOS>
but
I
would
tell
them
nothing
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
how
I
suffer
,
believe
every
hour
that
they
would
close
down
that
lid
.
<EOS>
then
the
brute
,
find
me
defiant
,
and
believe
that
no
one
be
aware
of
their
existence
,
hit
upon
another
device
--
send
a
false
telegram
to
my
father
from
Liverpool
,
and
thus
take
him
away
from
the
house
in
order
to
be
afford
a
clear
field
for
their
investigation
.
<EOS>
of
this
I
,
of
course
,
know
nothing
until
your
friend
enter
the
house
forcibly
with
the
police
and
find
me
still
imprison
--
ah
!
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
ready
for
death
and
burial
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
the
strange
old
Professor
,
step
forward
,
seize
my
hand
warmly
in
his
,
say
:
 
"
to
you
and
your
two
good
friend
,
Mr.
Jacox
,
the
country
owe
a
great
and
deep
debt
of
gratitude
.
<EOS>
I
be
foolish
in
disregard
your
timely
warning
,
for
my
dear
daughter
very
nearly
lose
her
life
,
because
the
blackguard
know
she
have
assist
me
in
my
experiment
and
have
make
the
note
at
my
dictation
,
while
Britain
very
nearly
lose
the
secret
upon
which
,
in
the
near
future
,
will
depend
her
supremacy
at
sea

and
the

a
nondescript

"
full
of
knock
and
noise
.
 
<EOS>
by
appointment
I

,
to
be

<EOS>
I
have

him
out
through

,
until
,
satisfied
with
my
skill
,
he
have
take
the
wheel

and
we
be
now
out
upon
the
Great
North
Road
,
where
he

a

engagement
to
meet
a
friend
.
 
<EOS>
beyond
Hatfield
we
pass
through
Ayot
Green

and
be
on
our
way
to
Welwyn
,
when
suddenly
he

the
powerful
car
into
a
narrow

where
,
after
several

with
slightly
curly

<EOS>
I
be

and
there
introduce
to
the
stout

I
find

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
he
exclaim
.
"
<EOS>

,
young

I
glance
from

surprise

<EOS>
what
do

<EOS>
both
see

the

out

throw
myself
down

both

the

ten
minute
later

go
downstairs
to
catch
his
train

<EOS>
this
incident
show
that
Robert
Brackenbury
be
essentially
a
man
of
action
.
<EOS>
His
keen
,
dark
aquiline
face
,
bright
,
sharp
eye
,
and
quick
,
almost
electric
movement
combine
to
show
him
to
be
a
man
of
nerve
,
resource
,
and
rapid
decision
.
<EOS>
the
square
low
jaw
betoken
hard
determination
,
while
at
the

his
manner
be
easy

nonchalant

essentially
that
of
a
bear
gentleman
.

William
return
next
morning
,
and
a
few
day
pass
uneventfully
.
<EOS>
both
morning
and
evening
each
day
,
at
hour
prearrange
,
he
"
get
on
"
to
Shand
,
but
their
conversation
be
very
enigmatical
.
<EOS>
several
time
I
happen
to
be
in
the
room
,
but
could
learn
nothing
from
the
talk
,
which
seem
,
in
the
main
,
to
refer
to
the
rise
and
fall
of
certain
mining
share
.
 
<EOS>
each
day
I
drive
him
out
in
the
"
ninety
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
car
,
a
four
-
cylinder
,
have
no
flexibility
,
and
be
a
perfect
terror
in
traffic
.
<EOS>
the
noise
it
cause
be
as
though
it
have
no
silencer
,
while
the
police
everywhere
look
askance
as
we
creep
through
the
Strand
,
dodge
the
motor
-
bus
in
Oxford
Street
,
or
put
on
a
move
down
Kensington
Gore
.
 
<EOS>
while
Bob
Brackenbury
--
as
he
be
know
to
his
friend
of
the
"
savoy"--was
out
one
day
,
I
be
in
his
bedroom
with
William
,
when
the
latter
open
one
of
the
huge
wardrobe
there
.
<EOS>
inside
I
see
hang
a
collection
of
at
least
fifty
coat
of
all
kind
,
some
smart
and
of
late
style
,
other
old
-
fashioned
and
dingy
,
while
more
than
one
be
greasy
,
out
-
at
-
elbow
,
and
ragged
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
remark
.
<EOS>
never
in
my
life
have
I
see
such
an
extensive
collection
of
clothe
belong
to
one
man
.
<EOS>
surely
those
ragged
coat
be
keep
there
for
purpose
of
disguise
!
<EOS>
yet
would
it
not
be
highly
necessary
for
a
member
of
the
Secret
Service
to
possess
certain
disguise
,
I
reflect
!
 
<EOS>
William
notice
my
interest
,
and
shut
the
door
hurriedly
.
 
<EOS>
I
drive
Brackenbury
hither
and
thither
to
various
part
of
London
,
for
he
seem
to
possess
many
friend
.
<EOS>
once
we
take
two
pretty
young
lady
from
Hampstead
down
to
the
"
Mitre
"
at
Hampton
Court
,
and
on
another
afternoon
we
take
a
young
french
girl
and
her
mother
from
the
"
Carlton
"
down
to
the
"
Old
Bridge
House
"
at
Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
to
me
it
be
apparent
that
Bob
Brackenbury
be
very
popular
with
a
certain
set
at
the
Motor
Club
,
at
the
Automobile
Club
,
and
at
other
resort
.
 
<EOS>
My
duty
be
not
at
all
arduous
,
and
such
a
thoroughgoe
sportsman
be
my
master
that
he
treat
me
almost
as
an
equal
.
<EOS>
when
out
in
the
country
he
compel
me
to
have
lunch
at
his
table
"
for
company
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
My
people
,
I
tell
him
,
have
be
wealthy
before
the
South
African
War
,
but
have
be
ruin
by
it
,
and
though
I
have
be
at
Rugby
and
have
do
one
year
at
Balliol
College
,
Oxford
,
I
hide
the
fact
now
that
I
be
compel
to
earn
my
living
as
a
mere
chauffeur
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
idea
that
I
be
a
barrister
,
with
chamber
in
New
Stone
Buildings
.
 
<EOS>
one
morning
after
breakfast
Mr.
Brackenbury
call
me
into
the
little
dining
-
room
,
wherein
stand
his
capacious
roll
-
top
desk
against
the
wall
,
with
the
telephone
upon
it
,
and
invite
me
to
a
seat
opposite
the
fireplace
,
say
in
a
voice
which
betray
just
the
faint
accent
:
 
"
Nye
,
<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
confidentially
to
you
for
a
few
minute
.
<EOS>
You
recollect
that
the
day
before
yesterday
when
down
at
Windsor
I
be
speak
with
a
police

inspector
in
uniform
,
who
call
at
the
hotel
to
see
me
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
He
look
round
the
car
and
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
would
come
to
take
our
name
for
exceed
the
limit
on
the
Staines
road
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
would
remember
him
again
if
you
see
him
?

"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
"
be
my
prompt
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
do
not
forget
him
,
"
he
urge
,
"
because
you
may
,
before
long
,
be
require
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
and
if
you
should
chance
to
mistake
the
man
,
a
very
serious
_
contretemp
_
would
ensue
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
recognise
him
again
among
a
thousand
!
<EOS>
"
I
declare
.
 
<EOS>
"
good
.
<EOS>
now
listen
attentively
to
me
for
a
few
minute
,
"
he
say
,
light
a
fresh
cigarette
and
fix
his
dark
,
penetrate
eye
upon
mine
.
<EOS>
"
I
and
my
friend
Shand
have
a
very
difficult
task
.
<EOS>
a
certain
Colonel
von
Rausch
,
of
the
German
Intelligence
Department
,
be
,
we
have
discover
,
in
England
on
a
secret
mission
.
<EOS>
It
be
suspect
that
he
be
here
control
a
number
of
spy
who
have
be
engage
in
staff
-
ride
in
the
eastern
county
,
and
to
receive
their
report
.
<EOS>
My
object
be
to
learn
the
truth
,
and
it
can
only
be
do
by
great
tact
and
caution
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
this
so
that
any
order
I
give
you
may
not
surprise
you
.
<EOS>
obey
,
and
do
not
seek
motive
.
<EOS>
be
I
clear
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
"
I
answer
,
interested
in
what
he
tell
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
curious
that
he
,
undoubtedly
a
German
,
be
at
the
same
time
antagonistic
to
the
colonel
of
the
Kaiser
's
army
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
be
leave
London
in
an
hour
.
<EOS>
Await
order
from
me
,
and
obey
them
promptly
<EOS>
,
"
he
say
,
dismiss
me
.
 
<EOS>
through
that
day
and
the
next
I
wait
.
<EOS>
He
have
take
William
with
him
into
the
country
,
and
leave
me
alone
in
the
flat
.
<EOS>
once
or
twice
the
telephone
rang
,
but
to
the
various
inquirer
I
reply
that
my
master
be
absent
.
 
<EOS>
inactivity
there
be
tantalise
.
<EOS>
I
be
naturally
fond
of
adventure
,
and
I
have
take
on
the
guise
of
chauffeur
surely
for
the
unmasking
of
a
foreign
spy
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
third
day
,
about
two
in
the
afternoon
,
I
receive
a
trunk
call
on
the

phone
.
<EOS>
the

Market
Harborough
call

up
,
and
the
voice
which
I
hear
be
that
of
my
master
.
 
<EOS>
"

"
<EOS>
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
want

to
start
in

in
an
hour
,
and
run

up
to
Peterborough

<EOS>
when
in
the
Market
Place
,
inquire
the
road
to
Edgcott
Hall
.
<EOS>
It
be
about
six
mile
out
on

<EOS>
inquire
for
me
there
as
Captain
Kinghorne
--
remember
the
name
now
.
<EOS>
do

hear
distinctly
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
reply
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
"
recollect
what
I
tell
you
before
I
leave
.
<EOS>
I
shall
expect

about
six
.
<EOS>
good
-
bye
,
"
he
say
,
and
then
ring
off
.
 
<EOS>
full
of
excitement
,
I
get
out
the
car
from
the
garage
,
fill
the
petrol
tank
,
see
to
the
carbide
,
and
then
set
out
across
the
suspension
bridge
at
Hammersmith
,
and
go
through
Kensal
Green
and
Hampstead
over
to
Highgate
,
where
I
get
upon
the
North
Road
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
be
rain
,
and
there
be
plenty
of
mud
about
,
but
the
big
,
powerful
car
run
well
notwithstanding
the
terrific
noise
it
create
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
be
such
a
terror
and
possess
so
many
defect
that
little
wonder
its
maker
have
not
place
his
name
upon
her
.
<EOS>
as
a
hill
-
climber
,
however
,
she
be
excellent
,
and
though
be
compel
constantly
to
change
my
"
speed
,
"
I
do
an
average
of
thirty
mile
an
hour
after
get
into
the
open
country
beyond
Codicote
.
 
<EOS>
through
crooked
old
Hitchin
I
slow
up
,
then
away
again
through
Henlow
and
Eton
Socon
up
Alconbury
Hill
and
down
the
broad
road
with
its
many
telegraph
line
<EOS>
,
I
go
with
my
exhaust
open
,
roar
and
throbbing
,
through
Stilton
village
into
the
quiet
old
cathedral
town
of
Peterborough
.
<EOS>
inquiry
in
the
Market
Place
lead
me
across
a
level
crossing
near
the
station
and
down
a
long
hill
,
then
out
again
into
a
flat
agricultural
district
until
I
come
to
the
handsome
lodge
-
gate
of
Edgcott
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
up
a
fine
elm
avenue
<EOS>
I
go
for
nearly
a
mile
,
until
I
see
before
me
in
the
crimson
<EOS>
sunset
a
long
,
old
Elizabethan
mansion
with
high
twist
chimney
and
many
lattice
window
.
<EOS>
the
door
be
open
,
and
as
I
pull
up
<EOS>
I
see
within
a
great
high
wall
with
stained
window
like
a
church
and
stand
of
armour
range
down
either
side
.
 
<EOS>
a
footman
in
yellow
waistcoat
answer
my
ring
,
and
my
inquiry
for
Captain
Kinghorne
bring
forth
my
master
,
smartly
dress
in
a
brown
flannel
suit
and
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hulloa
,
Nye

"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
.
"
<EOS>
Got
here
all
right
,
then
.
<EOS>
Newton
will
show
the
way
to
the
garage
,
"
and
he
indicate
the
footman
.
<EOS>
"
when
you
have
put
her
up
,
I
want
to
see
you
in
my
room
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
footman
,
mount
beside
me
,
direct
me
across
the
park
to
the
kennel
of
the
celebrated
Edgcott
hound
,
and
behind
these
I
find
a
well

appoint
garage
,
in
which
be
two
other
car
,
a

Fiat

year
ago
,
and
a
"
forty

Charron
with
a
limousine
body
,
a
very
heavy
,
ponderous
affair
.
 
<EOS>
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
I
find
myself
with
the
honourable
Bob
in
a
big
,
old
-
fashioned
bedroom
overlook
the
park
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
understand
me
on
the

phone
,
Nye
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
when
I
have
close
the
door
<EOS>
and
we
be
alone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shand
be
guest
here
with
me
under
the
name
of
Pawson
,
while
,
as
you
know
,
I
be
Captain
Kinghorne

<EOS>
D.S.O.
this
be
necessary
,
"
he
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
the
name
of
Bob
Brackenbury
would
,
in
an
instant
,
frighten
away
our
friend
the
German
.
<EOS>
the
people
here
,
the
Edgcotts
,
do
not
know
our
real
name
,
"
he
add
.
<EOS>
"
all
you
have
to
do
be
to
remain
here
and
act
as
I
direct
.
"
 
<EOS>
a
moment
later
the
stout
American
enter
and
greet
me
,
turn
to
his
friend
,
say
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
Nye
know
that
Charles
Shand

off
the
map
at
present
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
be
explain
,
"
my
master
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
you
would
better
spread
a
picturesque
story
among
the
servant
,
too
,
Nye
,
"
the
American
go
on--"the
bravery
of
Captain
Kinghorne
at
Ladysmith
,
and
the
wide
circle
of
financial
friend
possess
by
Archibald
Pawson
,
of
Goldfields
,
Nevada
.
<EOS>
the
Edgcotts
must
be
fill
up
with
us
,
and
that
infernal
Dutchman
must
not
suspect
that
we
have
anything
to
do
with
Whitehall
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
that
moment
William
,
the
valet
,
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
"
Von
Rausch
meet
a
strange
man
this
afternoon
in
a
little
thatch
inn
call
the
'
Fitzwilliam
Arms

over
at
Castor
.
<EOS>
They
be
nearly
half
an
hour
together
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
groom
pull
up
there
for
a
drink
and
see
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
suppose
he
meet
one
of
his
secret
agent
,
"
remark
my
master
,
with
a
glance
at
his
friend
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
get
to
have
our
eye
open
,
and
there
must
not
be
any
moss
on
us
in
this
affair
.
<EOS>
to
expose
this
man
and
his
spy
crowd
will
be
to
teach
Germany
a
lesson
which
she
be
long
want
.
<EOS>
We
shall
receive
the
private
thank
of
the
Cabinet
for
our
service
,
which
would
be
to
us
,
patriotic
englishman
as
we
all
be
,
something
to
be
proud
of
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
guess
two
head
be
well
than
one
,
as
the
hatter
say
when
twins
enter
his
shop
,
"
laugh
the
broad
-
faced
American
.
 
<EOS>
We
both
agree
,
and
a
few
moment
later
I
leave
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
the
Edgcotts
seem
to
be
entertain
quite
a
large
house
-
party
,
<EOS>
all
of
them
smart
people
,
for
that
evening
after
dinner
I
catch
sight
of
pretty
woman
in
handsome
dress
and
flash
jewel
.
<EOS>
be
a
warm
night
,
bridge
be
play
in
the
fine
old
hall
,
where
the
vaulted
roof
echo
back
the
well
-
breed
laughter
and
gay
chatter
of
the
party
,
which
include
Mr.
Henry
Seymour
,
civil
Lord
of
the
Admiralty
,
and
several
well
-
know
politician
.
 
<EOS>
essentially
a
sport
crowd
,
many
of
them
be
man
and
woman
who
hunt
in
winter
with
the
Cottesmore
,
the
Woodland
Pytchley
and
the
Edgcott
pack
.
<EOS>
William
and
I
peep
in
through
the
crack
of
one
of
the
door
,
and
he
point
out
to
me
a
tall
,
fair
-
haired
,
middle
-
aged
man
whose
soft
-
pleat
shirt
-
front
and
the
cut
of
whose
dress
-
coat
betray
him
to
be
a
foreigner
.
<EOS>
at
that
moment
he
be
lean
over
the
chair
of
a
pretty
little
dark
-
haired
woman
in
pale
blue
,
who
strike
me
as
a
foreigner
also
,
and
who
wear
twist
twice
around
her
neck
a
magnificent
rope
of
large
pearl
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
von
Rausch
,
"
William
explain
.
<EOS>
"
and
look
at
the
guv'nor
!
"
<EOS>
he
add
.
<EOS>
"
He
seem
to
be
have
a
good
time
with
the
thin
woman
over
there
.
<EOS>
He
be
talk
in
French
to
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
My
eye
wander
in
search
of
Pawson
,
and
I
see
that
he
be
seat
at
one
of
the
bridge
-
table
silently
contemplate
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
german
spy
be
evidently
a
great
favourite
with
the
lady
.
<EOS>
perhaps
his
popularity
with
the
fair
sex
have
gain
for
him
entry
to
that
little
circle
of
the
elegant
world
.
<EOS>
two
young
girl
approach
him
,
laugh
gaily
and
slowly
fan
themselves
.
<EOS>
He
then
chat
with
all
three
in
English
which
have
only
a
slight
trace
of
teutonic
accent
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
man
be
,
<EOS>
I
reflect
,
the
head
of
a
horde
of
secret
agent
which
the
German
War
Office
have
fling
upon
our
eastern
coast
.
<EOS>
to
expose
and
crush
them
all
be
surely
the
patriotic
duty
of
any
Englishman
.
 
<EOS>
the
magnificent
old
mansion
with
its
splendid
painting
,
its
antique
furniture
,
its
armour
,
its
bric
-
a
-
brac
,
old
silver
,
and
splendid
heirloom
of
the
Edgcotts
ring
with
the
laughter
of
the
assembly
as
two
young
subaltern
indulge
in
humorous
horse
-
play
.
 
<EOS>
the
appearance
of
the
old
sphinx
-
like
family
butler
,
however
,
compel
us
to
leave
our
point
of
observation
,
and
for
an
hour
I
stroll
with
William
out
in
the
park
in
the
balmy
moonlight
of
the
summer
night
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
will
be
a
sensation
before
long
,
"
declare
the
valet
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
You
watch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
in
what
way
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
,
with
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
"
wait
and
see
<EOS>
,
"
he
laugh
,
as
though
he
possess
knowledge
of
what
be
intend
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
I
drive
my
master
and
the
german
Colonel
over
to
Nottingham
,
where
we
put
up
for
an
hour
at
the
Black
Boy
Hotel
.
<EOS>
this
strike
me
as
curious
,
for
I
recollect
that
William
have
be
send
down
from
London
with
a
message
to
some
person
name
Raven
stay
at
that
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
way
from
Edgcott
,
through
Oakham
,
Melton
Mowbray
,
and
Trent
,
I
have
endeavour
to
catch
some
of
the
conversation
between
the
pair
in
the
car
behind
me
.
<EOS>
the
noise
and
rattle
,
however
,
prevent
me
from
overhear
much
,
but
the
stray
sentence
which
do
reach
me
when
I
slow
down
to
change
my
speed
show
them
to
be
on
the
most
friendly
term
.
 
<EOS>
evidently
the
spy
be
entirely
unsuspicious
of
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
hotel
,
after
I
have
put
up
the
car
,
I
see
my
master
and
the
German
speak
with
a
tall
,
thin
,
consumptive
-
look
man
in
black
,
whose
white
tie
show
him
to
be
a
dissent
minister
.
<EOS>
He
be
clean
-
shaven
,
aged
fifty
,
and
have
an
unusually
protrude
chin
.
 
<EOS>
all
three
go
out
together
and
walk
along
the
street
chatting
.
<EOS>
when
they
have
go
I
go
back
into
the
yard
,
and
on
inquiry
find
that
the
minister
be
the
Reverend
Richard
Raven
,
of
the
Baptist
Missionary
Society
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
a
missionary
in
China
,
and
have
address
several
meeting
in
Nottingham
and
the
neighbourhood
on
behalf
of
the
society
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
I
wonder
,
have
Bob
Brackenbury
,
so
essentially
a
man
about
town
,
come
there
to
consult
a
Baptist
missionary
,
and
accompany
,
too
,
by
the
man
he
be
scheme
to
unmask
?
 
<EOS>
but
the
way
of
the
Secret
Service
be
devious
and
crooked
,
I
argue
.
<EOS>
there
be
method
in
it
all
.
<EOS>
have
Ray
and
I
be
mistake
after
all
?
<EOS>
so
I
,
too
,
light
a
cigarette
,
and
stroll
out
into
the
bustling
provincial
street
await
my
master
and
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
after
an
hour
and
a
half
the
trio
come
back
and
have
a
drink
together
in
the
smoking
-
room
--
the
missionary
taking
lemonade
--
and
then
I
bring
round
the
car
,
and
we
begin
the
return
journey
of
about
sixty
-
five
mile
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
of
it
now
?
"
<EOS>
ask
my
master
of
his
companion
as
soon
as
we
be
away
from
the
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Excellent
!
"
be
the
German
's
reply
.
<EOS>
"
It
only
now
lie
with
her
,
eh
?
"
and
he
laugh
lightly
.
 
<EOS>
dinner
be
over
when
we
return
,
and
Captain
Kinghorne
be
profuse
in
his
apology
to
his
host
.
<EOS>
I
have
previously
be
warn
to
say
nothing
of
where
we
have
be
,
and
I
hear
my
master
explain
that
we
have
pass
through
Huntingdon
,
where
a
tyre
-
burst
have
delay
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
become
puzzled
.
<EOS>
yes
,
it
be
certainly
both
interesting
and
exciting
.
<EOS>
little
do
the
gallant
German
Colonel
dream
of
the
sword
of
England
's
wrath
suspend
above
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
nearly
a
week
pass
.
<EOS>
Captain
Kinghorne
,
D.S.O.
,
and
Mr.
Pawson
,
of
Goldfields
,
Nevada
,
share
,
I
see
,
with
the
Colonel
the
high
popularity
among
member
of
the
house
-
party
.
<EOS>
with
Mr.
Henry
Seymour
they
have
become
on
particularly
friendly
term
.
<EOS>
there
be
picnic
,
tennis
,
and
a
couple
of
dance
to
which
all
the
local
notability
be
bidden
.
<EOS>
at
them
all
Kinghorne
be
the
life
and
soul
of
the
general
merriment
.
<EOS>
a
good
many
quiet
flirtation
be
in
progress
too
.
<EOS>
Kinghorne
seem
to
be
particularly
attract
by
the
pretty
little
widow
whom
I
have
first
see
in
pale
blue
,
and
who
I
discover
be
French
,
her
name
be
the
Baronne
de
Bourbriac
.
<EOS>
She
seem
to
divide
her
attention
between
Mr.
Seymour
and
the
German
Colonel
.
 
<EOS>
from
mademoiselle
,
her
maid
,
I
learn
that
Madame
la
Baronne
have
lose
her
husband
after
only
four
month
of
matrimony
,
and
now
find
herself
in
possession
of
a
great
fortune
,
a
house
in
the
Avenue
des
Champs
Elysees
,
a
villa
at
Roquebrune
,
and
the
great
mediaeval
chateau
of
Bourbriac
,
in
the
great
wine
-
land
along
the
Saone
.
 
<EOS>
be
she
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
,
contemplate
matrimony
again
?
<EOS>
one
evening
before
the
dressing
-
bell
sound
,
I
meet
them
quite
accidentally
stroll
together
across
the
park
,
and
the
earnestness
of
their
conversation
cause
my
wonder
to
increase
.
 
<EOS>
careful
observation
,
however
,
show
me
that
Colonel
von
Rausch
be
almost
as
much
a
favourite
with
the
little
widow
as
be
the
honourable
Bob
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
in
the
three
day
which
follow
I
recognise
plainly
that
the
skittish
little
widow
,
so
charming
,
so
chic
,
and
dress
with
that
perfection
only
possible
with
the
true
Parisienne
,
be
play
a
double
game
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
inclined
to
tell
my
master
,
yet
on
due
reflection
see
that
his
love
affair
be
no
concern
of
mine
,
while
to
speak
would
be
only
to
betray
myself
as
spy
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
hold
silence
,
but
nevertheless
continue
to
watch
.
 
<EOS>
several
time
I
take
out
Brackenbury
,
Shand
,
von
Rausch
,
and
other
in
the
car
.
<EOS>
twice
the
widow
go
for
a
run
alone
with
my
master
and
myself
.
<EOS>
life
be
,
to
say
the
least
,
extremely
pleasant
in
those
warm
summer
day
at
Edgcott
.
 
<EOS>
late
one
afternoon
the
Honourable
Bob
find
me
in
the
garage
,
and
in
a
low
voice
say
:
 
"
You
must
pretend
to
be
unwell
,
Nye
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
take
von
Rausch
out
by
myself
,
so
go
back
to
the
house
and
pretend
you
be
queer
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
I
do
without
question
,
and
he
and
the
Colonel
be
out
together
in
an
unknown
direction
until
nearly
midnight
.
<EOS>
have
they
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
,
go
again
to
meet
the
consumptive
converter
of
the
Chinese
to
Christianity
?
 
<EOS>
I
take
William
into
my
confidence
,
but
he
be
silent
.
<EOS>
He
would
express
no
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
moss
on
the
guv'nor
,
you
bet
,
"
be
all
he
would
vouchsafe
.
 
<EOS>
thus
for
yet
another
four
day
thing
progress
merrily
at
Edgcott
Hall
.
<EOS>
William
have
be
send
away
on
a
message
up
to
Manchester
,
and
I
be
take
his
place
,
when
one
evening
,
while
I
be
get
out
"
the
guv'nor
's
"
dress
clothe
,
he
enter
the
room
,
and
close
the
door
carefully
,
say
:
 
"
be
ready
for
something
to
happen
to
-
night
,
Nye
.
<EOS>
We
be
go
to
hold
up
the
spy
and
make
him
disgorge
all
the
secret
report
supply
by
his
agent
.
<EOS>
listen
to
my
instruction
,
for
all
must
be
do
without
any
fuss
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
want
to
upset
the
good
people
here
.
<EOS>
You
see
that
small
dressing
-
case
of
mine
over
there?"--and
he
indicate
a
square
crocodile
-
skin
case
with
silver
fitting
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
at
ten
o'clock
go
and
get
the
car
out
on
the
excuse
that
you
have
to
go
into
Peterborough
for
me
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
Shand
's
bag
already
in
it
,
so
put
your
own
in
also
,
but
do
not
let
anybody
see
you
.
<EOS>
run
her
down
the
road
about
a
mile
from
the
lodge
-
gate
and
into
that
by
-
road
just
beyond
the
finger
-
post
where
I
show
you
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
then
pull
up
,
put
out
the
light
,
and
leave
her
as
though
you
have
have
a
breakdown
.
<EOS>
walk
back
here
,
get
my
dressing
-
case
,
and
carry
it
back
to
the
car
.
<EOS>
then
wait
for
us
.
<EOS>
only
recollect
,
do
not
return
to
get
my
bag
until
half
-
past
ten
.
<EOS>
You
see
those
two
candle
on
the
dressing
-
table
?
<EOS>
now
if
any
hitch
occur
,
I
shall
light
them
.
<EOS>
so
if
I
do
,
leave
my
bag
here
and
bring
my
car
back
.
<EOS>
You
understand
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Quite
,
"
I
say
,
full
of
excitement
.
<EOS>
and
then
I
help
him
to
dress
hurriedly
,
and
he
go
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
about
to
"
hold
up
"
the
spy
.
<EOS>
but
how
?
 
<EOS>
those
hour
drag
slowly
by
.
<EOS>
I
peep
into
the
hall
after
dinner
and
see
the
honourable
Bob
seat
in
a
corner
with
the
Baronne
,
away
from
the
other
,
chat
with
her
.
<EOS>
the
spy
,
all
unsuspicious
,
be
talk
to
his
hostess
,
while
Shand
be
play
poker
.
 
<EOS>
just
before
ten
I
creep
out
with
my
small
bag
,
unseen
by
any
one
,
and
walk
across
the
park
to
the
garage
.
<EOS>
the
night
be
stormy
,
the
moon
be
hide
behind
a
cloud
-
bank
.
<EOS>
there
be
nobody
about
,
so
I
get
out
the
"
ninety
,
"
start
her
,
and
mount
at
the
wheel
be
soon
glide
down
the
avenue
,
out
of
the
lodge
-
gate
,
and
into
the
by
-
road
which
the
honourable
Bob
have
indicate
.
<EOS>
descending
,
I
look
inside
the
car
and
see
that
Shand
's
bag
have
already
be
place
there
by
an
unknown
hand
.
 
<EOS>
in
that
short
run
I
notice
I
have
lose
the
screw
cap
of
the
radiator
.
<EOS>
this
surprise
me
,
for
I
recollect
how
that
evening
when
fill
up
with
water
I
have
screw
it
down
tightly
.
<EOS>
somebody
must
have
tamper
with
it
--
some
stable
lad
,
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
have
extinguish
the
head
-
light
,
I
walk
back
to
the
Hall
by
the
stile
and
footpath
,
avoid
the
lodge
-
gate
,
and
manage
to
slip
up
to
my
master
's
room
,
just
as
the
stable
-
clock
be
chime
the
half
hour
.
 
<EOS>
the
candle
be
unlit
.
<EOS>
all
be
therefore
in
order
.
<EOS>
the
dressing
-
bag
be
,
however
,
not
there
.
<EOS>
I
search
for
it
in
vain
.
<EOS>
then
steal
out
again
I
speed
by
the
footpath
back
to
the
car
.
 
<EOS>
somebody
hail
me
in
the
darkness
as
I
approach
the
spot
where
I
have
leave
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
recognize
the
spy
's
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
see
Herr
Brackenbury
?
<EOS>
"
he
ask
in
his
broken
English
.
 
<EOS>
I
halt
,
amazed
.
<EOS>
the
spy
have
,
it
seem
,
outwit
us
and
upset
all
our
plan
!
 
<EOS>
scarcely
could
I
reply
,
however
,
before
I
hear
a
movement
behind
me
,
and
two
figure
loom
up
.
<EOS>
They
be
my
master
and
Shand
.
 
<EOS>
"
all
right
?
<EOS>
"
inquire
the
American
in
a
low
voice
,
to
which
the
spy
give
an
affirmative
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
light
those
lamp
,
Nye
,
"
order
my
master
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
get
away
this
instant
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
But----
"
I
exclaim
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quick
,
my
dear
fellow
!
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
moment
to
lose
.
<EOS>
jump
in
,
boy
,
"
he
urge
.
 
<EOS>
and
a
couple
of
minute
later
,
with
our
lamp
glare
,
we
have
turn
out
upon
the
broad
highway
and
be
travel
at
a
full
forty
mile
an
hour
upon
the
high
road
to
Leicester
.
 
<EOS>
what
could
it
all
mean
?
<EOS>
My
master
and
his
companion
seem
on
the
most
friendly
term
with
the
spy
.
 
<EOS>
ten
mile
from
the
lodge
-
gate
of
Edgcott
at
a
cross
-
road
we
pick
up
an
ill
-
dressed
man
whom
I
recognise
as
the
Baptist
missionary
,
Richard
Raven
,
and
with
the
honourable
Bob
at
my
side
direct
me
we
tear
on
through
the
night
,
traverse
numberless
by
-
road
,
until
at
dawn
I
suddenly
recognise
that
we
be
on
the
North
Road
,
close
to
Codicote
.
 
<EOS>
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
we
have
run
the
car
round
to
the
rear
of
Shand
's
pretty
rose
-
embower
cottage
,
and
all
descend
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
excuse
to
the
honourable
Bob
that
the
screw
top
of
the
radiator
be
miss
,
whereupon
von
Rausch
laugh
heartily
,
and
pick
up
a
piece
of
wire
from
the
bench
<EOS>
he
bend
it
so
as
to
form
a
hook
,
and
with
it
fish
down
in
the
hot
water
inside
.
 
<EOS>
His
companion
stand
watch
,
but
judge
my
surprise
when
I
see
him
of
a
sudden
draw
forth
a
small
aluminium
cylinder
,
the
top
of
which
he
screw
off
and
from
it
take
out
a
piece
of
trace
-
linen
tightly
fold
.
 
<EOS>
this
he
spread
out
,
and
my
quick
eye
see
that
it
be
a
carefully
draw
tracing
of
a
portion
of
the
new
type
of
battleship
of
the
_
Neptune
_
class
(
the
improved
_
Dreadnought
_
type
)
,
with
many
marginal
note
in
German
in
a
feminine
hand
.
 
<EOS>
in
an
instant
the
astounding
truth
become
plain
to
me
.
<EOS>
the
Baronne
,
who
be
in
von
Rausch
's
employ
,
have
no
doubt
surreptitiously
obtain
the
original
from
Mr.
Henry
Seymour
's
despatch
-
box
,
it
have
be
send
down
to
him
to
Edgcott
for
his
approval
.
 
<EOS>
a
most
important
british
naval
secret
be
,
I
see
,
in
the
hand
of
the
clever
spy
of
the
Kaiser
!
 
<EOS>
I
make
no
remark
,
for
in
presence
of
those
man
<EOS>
be
I
not
helpless
?
 
<EOS>
They
take
the
tracing
in
the
house
,
and
for
half
an
hour
hold
carousal
in
celebration
of
their
success
.
 
<EOS>
presently
Brackenbury
come
forth
to
me
and
say
:
 
"
the
Colonel
be
go
to
Harwich
this
evening
,
and
you
must
drive
him
.
<EOS>
the
boat
for
the
'
Hook
'
leave
at
half
-
past
ten
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
sir
,
"
I
reply
,
with
apparent
indifference
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
quite
ready
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
seven
we
start
,
von
Rausch
and
I
,
and
until
darkness
fall
<EOS>
I
drive
eastward
,
<EOS>
when
at
last
we
find
ourselves
in
Ipswich
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
,
close
to
the
White
Horse
Hotel
and
within
hail
distance
of
a
police
-
constable
,
I
bring
the
car
to
a
dead
stop
,
and
turn
to
the
German
,
who
be
seat
beside
me
,
say
in
as
quiet
a
tone
as
I
could
:
 
<EOS>
"
Colonel
von
Rausch
,
I
will
just
trouble
you
to
hand
over
to
me
the
trace
you
and
your
friend
have
steal
from
Mr.
Henry
Seymour
--
the
detail
of
the
new
battleship
about
to
be
build
at
Chatham
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
?
"
cry
the
spy
.
<EOS>
"
drive
on
,
you
fool
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
time
to
lose
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
for
that
tracing
,
"
I
say
,
whip
out
the
revolver
I
always
carry
.
"
<EOS>
give
it
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
next
!
"
<EOS>
he
laugh
,
in
open
defiance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
who
be
you
,
a
mere
servant
,
that
you
should
dictate
to
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
an
Englishman
!
"
<EOS>
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
and
I
will
not
allow
you
to
take
that
secret
to
your
employer
in
Berlin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
Colonel
glance
round
in
some
confusion
.
<EOS>
He
be
evidently
averse
to
a
scene
in
that
open
street
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
into
the
hotel
yonder
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
We
can
discuss
the
matter
there
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
admit
of
no
discussion
,
"
I
say
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
hand
me
the
tracing
over
which
you
have
so
ingeniously
deceive
me
,
or
I
shall
call
the
constable
yonder
and
have
you
detain
while
we
communicate
with
the
Admiralty
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
drive
on
,
I
tell
you
,
"
he
cry
in
anger
.
"
<EOS>
do
not
be
an
ass
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
a
fool
,
"
I
answer
.
<EOS>
"
give
me
that
trace
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
never
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
turn
and
whistle
to
the
constable
,
who
have
already
notice
us
in
heated
discussion
.
 
<EOS>
the
officer
approach
,
but
von
Rausch
,
find
himself
in
a
corner
,
quickly
produce
an
envelope
contain
the
tracing
and
hand
it
to
me
,
urge
:
 
<EOS>
"
remain
silent
,
Nye
.
<EOS>
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
have
promise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
break
open
the
envelope
,
and
after
satisfy
myself
he
have
not
deceive
me
,
I
place
it
safely
in
my
breast
-
pocket
,
as
further
evidence
of
the
work
of
the
Kaiser
's
spy
amongst
us
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
with
excuse
to
the
constable
,
I
swing
the
car
into
the
yard
of
the
White
Horse
Hotel
,
where
the
spy
descend
,
and
with
a
fierce
imprecation
in
German
he
hurry
out
,
and
I
see
him
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
at
midnight
I
be
in
Ray
's
chamber
,
in
Bruton
Street
,
and
we
ring
up
Mr.
Henry
Seymour
,
who
have
<EOS>
,
we
find
,
return
to
his
house
in
Curzon
Street
from
Edgcott
only
a
couple
of
hour
before
.
 
<EOS>
in
ignorance
that
spy
have
obtain
the
secret
of
the
_
Neptune
_
or
improve
_
Dreadnought
_
,
he
would
not
at
first
believe
the
story
we
tell
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
in
his
own
library
half
an
hour
later
we
hand
him
back
the
tracing
,
he
be
compel
to
admit
the
existence
of
german
espionage
in
England
,
though
in
the
House
of
Commons
only
a
week
before
he
have
scorn
the
very
idea

the

<EOS>
"
when
last
I
have
the
pleasure
of
meet
mademoiselle
,
both
her
nationality
and
her
name
be
--
well
--
slightly
different
,
eh
?
"
<EOS>
I
remark
,
bend
forward
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
from
her
pretty
lip
ring
out
a
merry
ripple
of
laughter
,
and
over
her
sweet
face
spread
a
mischievous
look
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
admit
the
allegation
,
M'sieur
Jacox
,
"
be
her
rather
saucy
response
in

beauty
such
as
yours

not

I

with
an
expression
of
mock
reproval

"
now
,
why
do
you
flatter
me

you

<EOS>
she
ask
,

especially
after
what
pass
at
Caux
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
surely
I
may
be
permit
to
admire
you
,

as

She
start
,
and
stare
at
me
for
a
moment

a
neat
little
figure
in
black
.
<EOS>
then
she
give
her
shoulder
a
slight

It
be
out
of
the
season
in
Paris
,
and
on
that
afternoon
,
the
15th
of
August
,
1908
,
to
be
exact
,
we
have
drive
by
"
auto
"
into
the
Bois
,
and
be
take
our
"
five
o'clock
"
under
the
tree
at
Pre
Catalan
,
that
well
-
know
restaurant
in
the
centre
of
the
beautiful
pleasure
wood
of
the
Parisians
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
serious
business
with
Suzette
Darbour
.
 
<EOS>
after
our
success
in
prevent
the
plan
of
the
improve
_
Dreadnoughts
_
fall
into
german
hand
,
I
have
,
at
Ray
's
suggestion
,
leave
Charing
Cross
in
search
of
the
dainty
little
divinity
before
me
,
the
neat
-
waiste
girl
with
the
big
dark
eye
,
the
tiny
mouth
,
and
the
cheek
that
still
bear
the
bloom
of
youth
upon
them
--
the
girl
who
,
at
the
Hotel
d'Angleterre
,
in
Copenhagen
,
have
be
know
as
Vera
Yermoloff
,
of
Riga
,
and
who
have
afterwards
live
in
the
gay
little
watering
-
place
of
Caux
under
the
same
name
,
and
have
so
entirely
deceive
me
--
the
girl
whom
I
now
know
to
be
the
catspaw
of
other
--
in
a
word
,
a
decoy
!
 
<EOS>
yet
how
sweet
,
how
modest
her
manner
,
how
demure
she
look
as
she
sit
there
before
me
at
the
little
table
beneath
the
tree
,
sip
her
tea
and
lift
her
smile
eye
to
mine
.
<EOS>
even
though
I
have
tell
her
plainly
that
I
be
aware
of
the
truth
,
she
remain
quite
unconcerned
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
fear
of
me
apparently
.
<EOS>
for
her
,
exposure
and
the
police
have
no
terror
.
<EOS>
She
seem
rather
amuse
than
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
I
light
a
cigarette
,
and
by
so
do
obtain
time
for
reflection
.
 
<EOS>
My
search
have
lead
me
first
to
the
Midi
,
thence
into
Italy
,
across
to
Sebenico
in
Dalmatia
,
to
Venice
,
and
back
to
Paris
,
where
only
that
morning
,
with
the
assistance
of
my
old
friend
of
my
student
day
in
the
french
capital
,
Gaston
Bernard
,
of
the
Prefecture
of
Police
,
I
have
succeed
in
run
her
to
earth
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
that
morning
find
her
reside
with
a
girl
friend
--
a
seamstress
at
Duclerc's
--
in
a
tiny
flat
_
<EOS>
au
cinquieme
_
in
a
frowsy
old
house
at
the
top
of
the
Rue
Pigalle
,
and
live
in
her
own
name
,
that
of
Suzette
Darbour
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
I
sit
smoke
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
I
dare
request
her
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
my
effort
to
combat
the
work
of
german
spy
in
England
I
have
be
force
to
make
many
queer
friendship
,
but
none
perhaps
so
strange
as
the
one
I
be
now
cultivate
.
<EOS>
Suzette
Darbour
be
,
I
have
learn
from
Ray
Raymond
a
few
month
ago
,
a
decoy
in
association
with
a
very
prince
of
swindler
,
an
American
who
make
his
head
-
quarter
in
Paris
,
and
who
have
in
the
past
year
or
two
effect
amazing
_
coup
_
,
financial
and
otherwise
,
in
the
various
capital
of
Europe
.
 
<EOS>
Her
age
be
perhaps
twenty
-
two
,
though
certainly
she
do
not
look
more
than
eighteen
.
<EOS>
She
speak
both
English
and
Russian
quite
well
,
for
,
as
she
have
tell
me
long
ago
,
she
have
spend
her
early
day
in
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
and
probably
in
those
twenty
year
of
her
life
she
have
learn
more
than
many
woman
have
learn
in
forty
.
 
<EOS>
Hers
be
an
angelic
face
,
with
big
,
wide
-
open
,
truthful
eye
,
but
her
heart
be
,
I
know
,
cold
and
callous
.
 
<EOS>
Could
I
--
dare
I
--
take
her
into
my
service
--
to
assist
me
in
a
matter
of
the
most
vital
importance
to
british
interest
?
<EOS>
the
mission
upon
which
I
be
engage
at
that
moment
be
both
delicate
and
difficult
.
<EOS>
a
single
false
move
would
mean
exposure
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
play
a
deep
game
,
and
it
surely
behove
me
to
exercise
every
precaution
.
<EOS>
during
the
year
I
have
be
endeavour
to
prove
the
peril
to
which
England
be
expose
from
foreign
invasion
,
I
have
never
be
near
failure
than
now
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
hold
my
breath
each
time
I
recollect
all
that
depend
upon
my
success
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
Raymond
,
Vera
Vallance
,
and
myself
have
constitute
ourselves
into
a
little
band
with
the
object
of
combat
the
activity
of
the
ingenious
spy
of
the
Kaiser
.
<EOS>
little
do
the
average
Englishman
dream
of
the
work
of
the
secret
agent
,
or
how
his
success
or
failure
be
reflect
in
our
diplomatic
negotiation
with
the

.
<EOS>
ambassador
and
minister
may
wear
smart
uniform
with
glitter
decoration

and
move
in
their
splendid

surround

their
brilliant

the

for

<EOS>
after

it
be
upon

His

<EOS>
We
have
for
month
be
work
on
without
publicity
,
unheeded
,
unrecognised
,
unprotected
,
unknown
.
<EOS>
a
thankless
though
dangerous
task
,
our
only
reward
have
be
a
kind
word
from
the
silent

sad
-
faced
Prime
Minister
himself
.
<EOS>
for
month
our
whereabout
have
be
unknown
,
even
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
Ray
generally
scent
the
presence
of
spy
,
and
it
be
for
me
to
carry
through
the
inquiry
in
the
manner
which
I
consider
good
and
safe
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
"
Suzette
,
"
I
say
at
length
,
look
at
her
across
the
rise
smoke
from
my
cigarette

"
<EOS>
when
we
last
meet
you

the
advantage
of
me

day
we
stand
upon

ground

"
 
<EOS>
"
Pardon
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
quite
understand
?
"
<EOS>
ask
the
little
lady
in
the
sheath
costume
with
just
a
slight
tremor
of
the
eyelid
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
--
I
have
discover
that
you
and
Henry
Banfield
be
friend
--
that
to
you
he
owe
much
of
his
success

and
that
to
you
be
the
credit
of
a
little
affair
in
Marienbad
,
which
end
rather
unpleasantly
for
a
certain
hosiery
manufacturer
from
Chemnitz
name
Mueller
.
"
 
<EOS>
Her
face
blanch
,
her
eye
grow
terrified
,
and
her
nail
clench
themselves
into
her
white
palm
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
then
you
--
you
have
find
me
,
m'sieur

for
purpose
of
revenge

<EOS>
you
--
you
intend
to
give
me
over
to
the
police
because
of
the
fraud
I
practise
upon
you

but
I
ask
you
to
have
pity
for
me

"
she
beg
in
French

<EOS>
"
I
be
a
woman

you
that

act
towards

<EOS>
"
You
force
open
my

valuable
there

find
,
to
your
dismay

only
a
few
paper
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
compel
to
do
so
by
Banfield
,
"
she
say
simply
.
"
<EOS>
He
mistake
you
for
another
man
,
a
diplomat
,
and
believe
that
you
have
certain
important
document
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
he
make
a
very
great
mistake
,
"
I
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
and
after
your
clever
love
-
make
with
me
you
only
get
some
extract
from
a
Government
report
,
together
with
a
few
old
letter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
from
those
letter
we
discover
who
you
really
be

and
then
we
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
afraid
that
I
would
pay
Banfield
back
in
his
own
coin
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
He
be
not

for
he
tell
me
that
if
you
attempt
any
reprisal
,
he
would
at
once
denounce
you
to
the
Germans
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
thanks

<EOS>
I
be
glad
you
have
tell
me
that
,
"
I
say
,
with
feign
unconcern
.
<EOS>
truth
to
tell
,
however
,
I
be
much
upset
by
the
knowledge
that
the
cunning
American
who
so
cleverly
evade
the
police
have
discover
my
present
vocation
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
after
all
,
have
not
the
explanation
of
the
pretty
girl
before
me
rather
strengthen
my
hand
?
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
Suzette
,
"
I
say
,
with
a
moment
's
reflection
,
"
I
have
not
seek
you
in
order
to
threaten
you
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
I
be
extremely
anxious
that
we
should
be
friend

<EOS>
indeed
,
I
want
you
,
if
you
will
,
to
do
me
a
service
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
look
me
straight
in
the
face
,
apparently
much
puzzle
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
be
my
enemy

"
she
remark
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
I
be
not

<EOS>
if
you
will
only
allow
me
,
I
will
be
your
friend

"
 
<EOS>
Her
fine
eye
be
downcast
,
and
I
fancy
I
detect
in
them
the
light
of
unshed
tear
.
<EOS>
how
strange
it
be
that
upon
her
attitude
towards
me
should
depend
a
nation
's
welfare
!
 
<EOS>
"
first
,
you
must
forgive
me
for
my
action
at
Caux
,
"
she
say
in
a
low
,
earnest
voice
,
scarce
above
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
my
position

alas
!

"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
if
I
disobey
any
single
one
of
his

he
would
deliver
me
over
at
once
to
the

for
a
serious
affair
--
a
crime
,
however
,
of
which
I
swear
to
you
that
I
be
innocent

the
crime
of
murder
!

<EOS>
"
He
hold
threat
over
you
,
"
I
say
,
toss
away
my
cigarette
.
<EOS>
"
describe
the
affair
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
crime
of
the
Rue

two
year

<EOS>

and
Banfield
charge
you
with
the
crime
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
admit
that
I
be
in
the
apartment
when
the
crime
be
commit
--
decoy
there
for
that
purpose
--
but
I
be
not
the
culprit
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
surely
you
could
prove
the
identity
of
the
assassin
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
him
for
an
instant
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
no
knowledge
of
who
he
be
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
why
do
you
fear
this
american
crook
?
<EOS>
why
not
dissociate
yourself
from
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
because
it
would
mean
my
betrayal
and
ruin

<EOS>
I
have
no
means

this
dastardly
allegation

<EOS>
I
be
in
his
power

"
 
<EOS>
"
You
love
him
,
perhaps
?
<EOS>
"
I
remark
,
my
gaze
full
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
love
him
!
"
<EOS>
she
protest
,
with
flashing
eye
.
<EOS>
"
I
hate
him
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
go
on
to
explain
how
she
be
hold
powerless
in
the
hand
of
the
scoundrel
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
lover
,
I
understand
,
mademoiselle

<EOS>
"
I
remark
presently
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
silent
,
but
about
the
corner
of
her
pretty
mouth
there
play
a
slight
smile
which
tell
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
not
cut
yourself
adrift
from
this
life
of
yours
?
<EOS>
"
I
urge
.
<EOS>
"
let
me
be
your
friend

assist
you
against
this
fellow
Banfield

how

you
assist
me

<EOS>
He
know
what
you

would

you
instantly

"
 
<EOS>
what
she
say
be
certainly
a
very
awkward
truth
.
<EOS>
Banfield
be
one
of
the
clever
scoundrel
in
Europe
,
an
unscrupulous
man
who
,
by
reason
of
certain
sharp
deal
,
have
become
possess
of
very
considerable
wealth
,
his
criminal
method
be
always
most
carefully
conceal
.
<EOS>
the
police
know
him
to
be
a
swindler
,
but
there
be
never
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
.
 
<EOS>
to
obtain
Suzette
's
service
<EOS>
I
would
,
I
see
,
be
compel
to
propitiate
him
.
 
<EOS>
alone
there
,
beneath
the
softly
murmur
tree
,
I
stretch
forth
my
hand
across
the
table
and
take
her
neatly
glove
finger
in
mine
,
say
:
 
"
Suzette
,
what
I
be

I

unscrupulous

chivalrous

oppress

hateful----
"
 
<EOS>
at
my
word
she
burst
into
tear
,
hold
my
hand
convulsively
in
hers
.
 
<EOS>
"
no

I
say
in
a
voice
of
sympathy

the
profession

neither

exactly
honourable

they

nevertheless

let
us

<EOS>
in
Berlin
certain
negotiation
be
at
this
moment
in
active
progress
with
St.
Petersburg
and
New
York
,
with
the
object
of
form
an
offensive
alliance
against
England

<EOS>
this
would
mean
that
in

inevitable

my
country
must
meet
not
only
her
fierce
enemy

Germany

I
have
reason
to
believe
that
matter
have
secretly
progress

they
be
very
near
a
settlement

what
I
desire
to
know
be
the
actual
inducement

out

the
Kaiser

do
you
follow

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
perfectly
,
"
she
say
,
at
once
attentive
.
<EOS>
"
I
quite
recognise
the
danger
to
your
country
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
danger
be
to
France
also
,
"
I
point
out
.
"
<EOS>
for
the
past
six
month
an
active
exchange
of
despatch
have
be
in
progress
,
but
so
carefully
have
the
truth
be
conceal
that
only
by
sheer
accident
--
a
word
let
drop
in
a
drawing
-
room
in
London
--
I
scent
what
be
in
the
wind
.
<EOS>
then
I
at
once
see
that
you
,
Suzette
,
be
the
only
person
who
could
assist
us
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
an
expert
in
the
art
of
pry
into
despatch
-
box
,
"
I
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
in
Berlin
,
at
the
Kaiserhof
Hotel
,
there
be
stay
a
certain
Charles
Pierron
.
<EOS>
if
any
one
be
aware
of
the
truth
that
man
be
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
go
to
Berlin
,
make
his
acquaintance
,
and
learn
what
he
know
.
<EOS>
if
what
I
suspect
be
true
,
he
possess
copy
of
the
despatch
emanate
from
the
german
Foreign
Office
.
<EOS>
and
of
these
I
must
obtain
a
glimpse
at
all
hazard
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
who
be
this
Pierron
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
at
the
'
Angleterre
,
'
in
Copenhagen
,
when
you
be
there
,
but
I
do
not
think
you
see
him
.
<EOS>
the
reason
of
my
presence
there
be
because
I
chance
to
be
interested
in
his
movement
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
he
--
an
undesirable
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
as
undesirable
as
I
be
myself
,
mademoiselle
,
<EOS>
"
I
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
a
french
secret
agent
--
an
Anglophobe
to
his
finger
-
tip
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
,
m'sieur
,
"
she
exclaim
;
"
you
desire
me
to
adopt
the
profession
of
the
spy
with
the
kid
glove
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
nod
in
the
affirmative
.
 
<EOS>
"
pierron
know
me
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
already
have
good
cause
to
remember
me
in
England
,
where
he
act
as
a
spy
of
Germany
,
"
I
remark
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
always
impressionable
where
the
fair
sex
be
concern
,
and
you
will
,
I
feel
confident
,
quickly
be
successful
if
you
live
for
a
few
day
at
the
'
Kaiserhof
'
as
Vera
Yermoloff
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
be
silent
,
apparently
reflect
deeply
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
prepared
,
of
course
,
to
offer
you
a
monetary
consideration
,
"
I
add
in
a
low
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
monetary
consideration
be
need
,
m'sieur
,
"
be
her
quick
response
.
"
<EOS>
in
return
for
the
fraud
I
practise
upon
you
,
it
be
only
just
that
I
should
render
you
this
service
.
<EOS>
yet
without
Banfield
's
knowledge
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
because
I
dare
not
leave
Paris
without
his
permission
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
you
must
go
with
his
knowledge
--
make
up
some
story
--
a
relative
ill
or
something
--
to
account
for
your
journey
to
Berlin
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
seem
undecided
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
repeat
my
suggestion
,
well
know
that
the
sweet
-
faced
girl
could
,
if
she
wish
,
obtain
for
us
the
knowledge
which
would
place
power
in
the
hand
of
Great
Britain
--
power
to
upset
the
machination
of
our
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
Mine
be
become
a
profession
full
of
subterfuge
.
 
<EOS>
Her
breast
heave
and
fall
in
a
long
-
draw
sigh
.
<EOS>
I
see
that
she
be
wavering
.
 
<EOS>
She
sip
her
tea
in
silence
,
her
eye
fix
upon
the
shady
tree
opposite
.
 
<EOS>
"
Suzette
,
"
I
exclaim
at
last
,
"
your
lover
's
name
be
Armand
Thomas
,
clerk
at
the
head
office
of
the
Compte
d'Escompte
.
<EOS>
He
believe
you
to
be
the
niece
of
the
rich
American
,
Henry
Banfield
,
little
dreaming
of
your
real
position
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
know
that
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
smile
,
tell
her
that
I
have
make
it
my
business
to
discover
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
love
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
look
her
straight
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
be
her
serious
response
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
you
have
keep
this
love
affair
secret
from
Banfield
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
.
<EOS>
if
he
know
the
truth
he
would
be
enrage
.
<EOS>
He
have
always
forbid
me
to
fall
in
love
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
because
he
fear
that
your
lover
may
act
as
your
protector
and
shield
you
from
his
evil
influence
,
"
I
remark
.
"
<EOS>
well
,
Suzette
,
"
I
add
,
"
you
be
a
very
clever
girl
.
<EOS>
if
you
be
successful
on
this
mission
<EOS>
I
will
,
I
promise
,
find
a
means
of
unite
you
with
your
lover
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
shake
her
head
sadly
,
reply
:
 
<EOS>
"
remember
Banfield
's
threat
.
<EOS>
disobedience
of
any
of
his
command
will
mean
my
ruin
.
<EOS>
besides
,
he
know
who
and
what
you
be
.
<EOS>
therefore
how
can
you
assist
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
,
"
I
say
,
again
extend
my
hand
to
my
dainty
little
friend
,
"
I
make
you
this
promise
not
only
on
my
own
behalf
--
but
also
on
behalf
of
my
country
,
England
.
<EOS>
be
it
a
compact
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
really
believe
you
can
help
me
to
free
myself
of
my
hateful
bond
?
<EOS>
"
she
cry
,
bend
towards
me
with
eager
anticipation
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
Suzette
,
that
in
return
for
this
service
you
shall
be
free
.
"
 
<EOS>
tear
again
stand
in
those
fine
dark
eye
.
<EOS>
I
know
of
her
secret
affection
for
young
Thomas
,
the
hard
-
work
bank
clerk
,
who
dare
not
aspire
to
the
hand
of
the
niece
of
the
great
american
financier
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
narrative
of
subterfuge
and
adventure
the
delightful
little
girl
seat
there
before
me
could
write
!
<EOS>
the
small
amount
I
know
be
amazingly
romantic
.
<EOS>
some
of
Banfield
's
smart
financial
_
coup
_
have
be
accomplish
owe
to
her
clever
manoeuvring
and
to
the
information
she
have
gain
by
her
almost
childish
artlessness
.
<EOS>
surely
the
british
Government
could
have
no
more
ingenious
seeker
after
political
secret
than
she
.
<EOS>
woman
be
always
more
successful
as
spy
than
man
.
<EOS>
that
be
why
so
many
be
employ
by
both
Germany
and
France
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
the
varied
adventure
in
my
search
after
spy
I
have
never
meet
a
girl
with
a
strange
history
than
Suzette
Darbour
.
<EOS>
that
she
have
actually
impose
upon
me
be
in
itself
,
I
think
,
sufficient
evidence
of
her
wit
,
cunning
,
and
innate
ability
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
rise
from
the
table
and
stroll
back
to
where
we
have
leave
the
"
auto
,
"
it
be
with
the
knowledge
that
my
long
search
have
not
be
in
vain
.
<EOS>
She
have
take
my
hand
in
promise
to
go
to
the
"
Kaiserhof
"
in
Berlin
and
pry
into
the
paper
of
that
foremost
of
secret
agent
,
Charles
Pierron
.
 
<EOS>
at
five
o'clock
next
morning
I
be
back
again
in
London
,
and
at
ten
I
be
seat
in
conference
with
Ray
Raymond
in
his
cosy
flat
in
Bruton
Street
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
must
get
at
the
term
offer
by
the
Germans
,
Jacox
,
"
he
declare
,
snap
his
finger
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
imperative
that
the
Foreign
Office
should
know
them
.
<EOS>
at
present
our
hand
be
utterly
tie
.
<EOS>
We
be
unable
to
act
,
and
our
diplomacy
be
at
a
complete
standstill
.
<EOS>
the
situation
be
dangerous
--
distinctly
dangerous
.
<EOS>
the
guv'nor
be
only
say
so
last
night
.
<EOS>
once
the
agreement
be
sign
,
then
good
-
bye
for
ever
to
Britain
's
power
and
prestige
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
explain
that
so
carefully
be
the
secret
preserve
that
I
have
be
unable
to
discover
anything
.
<EOS>
yet
I
have
hope
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Jack
,
England
rely
entirely
upon
you
,
"
he
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
know
the
plan
of
our
enemy
if
we
be
successfully
to
combat
them
.
<EOS>
in
the
past
you
have
often
do
marvel
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
hope
that
you
will
be
equally
successful
in
this
critical
moment
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
then
after
a
long
and
confidential
chat
we
part
and
<EOS>
a
couple
of
hour
later
I
be
again
in
the
boat
train
,
bind
for
the
Continent
.
<EOS>
I
recognise
how
urgent
be
the
matter
,
and
how
each
hour
's
delay
increase
our
peril
.
 
<EOS>
the
public
,
or
rather
the
omnivorous
reader
of
the
halfpenny
press
,
little
dream
<EOS>
how
near
we
be
at
that
moment
to
disaster
.
<EOS>
the
completion
of
the
cleverly
lay
plan
of
Germany
would
mean
a
sudden
blow
aim
at
us
,
not
only
at
our
own
shore
,
but
also
at
our
colony
at
the
same
moment
--
and
such
a
blow
,
with
our
weaken
army
and
neglect
navy
,
we
could
not
possibly
ward
off
.
 
<EOS>
well
I
remember
how
that
night
I
sit
in
the
corner
of
the
_
wagon
-
lit
_
of
the
Simplon
Express
and
reflect
deeply
.
<EOS>
I
be
on
my
way
to
Milan
to
join
a
friend
.
<EOS>
at
Boulogne
I
have
receive
a
wire
from
Suzette
,
who
have
already
depart
on
her
mission
to
Berlin
.
 
<EOS>
My
chief
difficulty
lie
in
the
unfortunate
fact
that
I
be
well
known
to
Pierron
,
who
have
now
forsake
his
original
employer
the
Germans
,
hence
I
dare
not
go
to
the
german
capital
,
lest
he
should
recognise
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
in
the
pay
of
the
french
Secret
Service
be
a
clerk
in
the
Treaty
department
of
the
German
Foreign
Office
,
and
without
doubt
he
be
furnish
Pierron
with
copy
of
all
the
correspondence
in
progress
.
<EOS>
both
the
french
and
german
government
spend
six
time
the
amount
annually
upon
secret
service
that
we
do
,
hence
they
be
always
well
and
accurately
inform
.
 
<EOS>
at
Milan
next
day
the
porter
at
the
"
Metropole
,
"
the
small
hotel
in
the
Piazza
del
Duomo
where
I
always
stay
,
hand
me
a
telegram
,
a
cipher
message
from
Ray
,
which
announce
that
his
father
have
discover
that
,
accord
to
a
despatch
just
receive
from
His
Majesty
's
Ambassador
at
St.
Petersburg
,
there
be
now
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
term
offer
by
Germany
be
extremely
advantageous
to
both
Russia
and
the
United
States
,
and
that
it
be
believe
that
the
agreement
be
on
the
actual
point
of
be
conclude
.
 
<EOS>
that
decide
me
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
at
all
hazard
,
even
though
Pierron
may
detect
my
presence
,
I
must
be
in
Berlin
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
,
however
,
unable
to
leave
Milan
at
once
,
for
Ford
,
whom
I
be
await
,
be
on
his
way
from
Corfu
and
have
telegraph
say
that
he
have
miss
the
mail
train
at
Brindisi
,
and
would
not
arrive
before
the
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
so
all
that
day
I
be
compel
to
hang
about
Milan
,
drink
vermouth
and
bitter
at
Biffi
's
cafe
in
the
Galleria
,
and
dining
alone
at
Salvini
's
.
<EOS>
I
always
hate
Milan
,
for
it
be
the
noisiest
and
most
uninteresting
city
in
all
Italy
.
 
<EOS>
next
afternoon
I
meet
Ford
at
the
station
and
compel
him
to
scramble
into
the
Bale
express
with
me
,
directly
after
he
have
alight
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
go
to
Berlin
.
<EOS>
You
come
with
me
,
and
go
on
to
St.
Petersburg
,
"
I
say
in
reply
to
his
question
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
middle
-
aged
man
,
a
retire
army
officer
and
a
perfect
linguist
,
who
be
a
secret
agent
of
the
British
Government
and
a
great
friend
of
Ray
's
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
way
on
that
long
,
tedious
run
to
Berlin
we
discuss
the
situation
.
<EOS>
I
be
the
first
to
explain
to
him
our
imminent
peril
,
and
with
what
craft
and
cunne
the
german
Chancellor
have
form
his
plan
for
the
defeat
and
downfall
of
our
Empire
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
know
,
all
trace
of
fatigue
vanish
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
go
along
the
corridor
,
wash
,
put
on
a
fresh
collar
,
brush
his
well
-
wear
suit
of
navy
serge
,
and
return
spruce
and
smart
,
ready
for
any
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
nothing
of
Suzette
.
<EOS>
Her
existence
I
have
resolve
to
keep
to
myself
.
<EOS>
in
go
to
Berlin
<EOS>
I
know
well
that
I
be
play
both
a
dangerous
and
desperate
game
.
<EOS>
Pierron
hate
me
,
and
if
he
detect
me
,
he
may
very
easily
denounce
me
to
the
police
as
a
spy
.
<EOS>
such
a
_
contretemp
_
<EOS>
would
,
I
reflect
,
mean
for
me
ten
year
'
confinement
in
a
fortress
.
<EOS>
the
german
authority
would
certainly
not
forget
how
for
the
past
two
year
I
have
hunt
their
agent
up
and
down
Great
Britain
,
and
be
the
mean
of
deport
several
as
undesirable
alien
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
I
feel
,
somehow
,
that
my
place
be
near
Suzette
,
so
that
I
could
prompt
her
,
and
if
she
be
successful
I
could
read
with
my
own
eye
the
copy
of
the
diplomatic
correspondence
from
the
german
Foreign
Office
.
 
<EOS>
on
arrival
at
Berlin
I
bid
Ford
farewell
,
have
give
him
certain
instruction
how
to
act
on
arrival
in
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
during
our
journey
we
have
make
up
a
special
telegraph
code
,
and
when
I
grasp
his
hand
<EOS>
he
say
:
 
"
<EOS>
well
,
good
luck
,
Jacox
.
<EOS>
be
careful
.
<EOS>
_
Au
revoir
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
he
hurry
along
the
platform
to
catch
the
Nord
Express
to
bear
him
to
the
russian
capital
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
"
Kaiserhof
"
I
take
a
sitting
room
and
bed
-
room
adjoin
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
about
ten
o'clock
at
night
;
therefore
I
sit
down
and
write
a

<EOS>
ten
minute
later
I
receive
a
scribble
reply
,
request
me
to

<EOS>
after

at

"
 
<EOS>
I
explain
the
extreme
urgency
of
the
matter
,
and
then
drive
her
back
to
the
hotel
,
alight
from
the
cab
a
few
hundred
yard
away
.
<EOS>
to
another
cafe
I
stroll
to
rest
and
have
a
smoke
,
and
it
be
near
midnight
when
I
re
-
enter
the
"
Kaiserhof
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
I
cross
the
great
hall
a
_
contretemp
_
occur
.
<EOS>
I
come
face
to
face
with
Pierron
,
a
tall
,
sallow
-
faced
,
red
-
bearded
man
with
eye
set
close
together
,
elegantly
dress
,
and
wear
a
big
diamond
in
his
cravat
.
 
<EOS>
in
an
instant
he
recognise
me
,
whereupon
I
bow
,
say
:
 
"
<EOS>
ah
,
m'sieur
!
<EOS>
It
be
really
quite
a
long
time
since
we
meet
--
in
Denmark
last
,
be
it
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
raise
his
eyebrow
slightly
,
and
reply
in
a
wither
tone
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
by
what
right
m'sieur
presume
to
address
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
that
moment
require
all
my
courage
and
self
-
possession
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
expect
to
meet
him
so
suddenly
.
<EOS>
He
have
evidently
just
come
from
his
journey
,
for
he
wear
a
light
travel
-
coat
and
soft
felt
hat
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
I
say
,
"
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
--
something
to
tell
you
in

if
you
could
grant
me
a
few
minute
.
<EOS>
"
I
merely
say
this
in
order
to
gain
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
_

then
--
at
whatever
hour
m'sieur
may
name

"
 
<EOS>
to

morrow

<EOS>
It
would
then
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
in
an
hour
he
may
inform
the
police
,
and
I
would
find
myself
under
arrest
.
<EOS>
the
german
police
would
be
only
too
pleased
to
have
an
opportunity
of
retaliate
.
 
<EOS>
"
no

"
I
exclaim
.
"
<EOS>
to

night

<EOS>
now

<EOS>
Our

will
only
take
a

<EOS>
come

I
want
to
explain

of
consequence

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
laugh
the
Frenchman
,
with
a
distinct
air
of
bravado

"
You
believe
yourself
extremely
clever

no

,
M'sieur
Jacox

<EOS>
let
me
hear
what
you
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
together
we
ascend
the
broad
marble
step
to
the
first
floor
,
and
I
hold
open
the
door
of
my
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
when
he
have
enter
,
I
close
it
,
and
offer
him
a
chair
,
commence
in
a
resolute
tone
:
 
"
now
,
M'sieur
Pierron
,
I
be
here
to
offer
term
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
term
!
"
<EOS>
he
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
_
Diable
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
I
foresee
your
evil
intention
against
myself
,
because
of
my
success
in
the
Brest
affair
,
"
be
my
quick
reply
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
denounce
me
here
in
Germany
as
a
british
agent
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
perfectly
correct
in
your
surmise
,
m'sieur
.
<EOS>
here
they
have
an
unpleasant
habit
in
their
treatment
of
foreign
spy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
do
it
not
usually
take
two
person
to
play
a
game
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
perfectly
cool
.
"
<EOS>
be
you
not
a
spy
also
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
go
to
the
police
,
_
mon
cher
ami
_
,
and
tell
them
what
you
will
,
"
he
laugh
defiantly
.
<EOS>
"
Straus
,
the
chief
of
police
here
,
be
my
friend
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
be
the
first
person
who
have
try
to
secure
my
arrest
and
fail
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
word
confound
me
.
<EOS>
I
see
that
I
alone
be
in
peril
,
and
that
he
,
by
reason
of
his
personal
friendship
with
the
chief
of
police
,
be
immune
from
arrest
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
walk
deliberately
,
and
with
eye
wide
open
,
into
the
trap
!
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
he
laugh
,
point
to
the
telephone
instrument
on
the
little
writing
-
table
,
"
<EOS>
I
have
only
to
take
that
and
call
up
the
police
office
,
and
your
british
Government
will
lose
the
service
of
one
of
its
shrewd
agent
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
that
be
your
revenge
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
realise
how
utterly
helpless
I
now
be
in
the
hand
of
my
bitter
enemy
--
the
man
who
have
turn
a
traitor
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
no
way
out
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
"
<EOS>
he
laugh
in
my
face
.
<EOS>
"
the
power
of
your
wonderful
old
country

so
old

be
already
at
an
end

<EOS>
in
a
month
you
will
have
german
soldier
swarm
upon
your
shore
,
while
America
will
seize
Canada

Australia

and
Russia
will
advance
into
India

<EOS>
You
will
be
crush
,
beat
,
humiliate

will
fly
over
your
proud
London

<EOS>
the
John
Bull
bladder
be
to
be
prick

<EOS>
he
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
not
exactly
news
to
me
,
M'sieur
Pierron
,
<EOS>
"
I
answer
quite
coolly
.
"
<EOS>
the
danger
of
my
country
be
equally
a
danger
to
yours

with
England

too

must
fall

"
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
an
army

a
brave
army

while
you
have
only
the
skeleton
that
your
great
Haldane
have
leave
to
you

"
he
sneer
.
"
<EOS>
but
enough
!
<EOS>
I
have
long
desire
this
interview
,
and
be
pleased
that
it
have
take
place
here
in
Berlin
,
"
and
he
deliberately
walk
across
to
the
telephone
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
to
snatch
the
transmitter
from
his
hand
,
but
though
we
struggle
,
he
succeed
in
inquire
for
a
number
--
<EOS>
the
number
of
the
police
head
-
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
catch
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
,
fool
that
I
be
to
have
come
there
at
risk
of
my
liberty
--
I
who
be
always
so
wary
and
so
circumspect
!
 
<EOS>
I
spring
at
his
throat
,
to
prevent
him
speak
further
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
do
this
!
<EOS>
"
I
cry
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
reply
be
only
a
hoarse
laugh
of
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
ask
for
somebody
--
his
friend
,
the
chief
of
police
!
<EOS>
then
turn
to
me
with
a
laugh
,
he
say
:
 
"
Straus
will
undoubtedly
be
pleased
to
arrest
such
big
game
as
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
he
utter
the
word
there
sound
a
low
tap
upon
the
door
,
and
next
second
it
open
,
reveal
the
neat
figure
in
pale
blue
.
 
<EOS>
Pierron
turn
quickly
,
but
in
an
instant
his
face
be
blanch
.
 
<EOS>
"
_
Dieu
!
<EOS>
Suzette
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
he
gasp
,
stare
at
her
,
while
she
stand
upon
the
threshold
,
a
strange
look
overspread
her
countenance
as
she
recognise
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
look
,
M'sieur
Jacox
!

"
she
shriek
a
second
later
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
--
yes
,
it
be
that
man
!
"
<EOS>
she
go
on
,
point
her
finger
at
him
.
"
<EOS>
at
last
!
<EOS>
thank
God
!
<EOS>
I
have
find
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
I
demand
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
M'sieur
Pierron

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
"
she
cry
,
"
that
be
the
man
whom
I
see
at
the
Rue
de
Royat

the
man
who
strangle
poor
Madame
Levitsky
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
lie
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
,
step
towards
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
--
i've
never
see
you
before
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
yet
you
have
just
utter
mademoiselle
's
name
,
m'sieur
,
"
I
remark
quietly
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
know
that
I
be
present
at
the
time
of
the
tragedy
,
"
exclaim
Suzette
quickly
,
"
and
that
he
be
the
pay
assassin
of
Henry
Banfield
.
<EOS>
He
kill
the
unfortunate
woman
for
two
reason
:
first
,
in
order
to
obtain
her
husband
's
paper
,
which
have
both
political
and
financial
importance
;
and
secondly
,
to
obtain
her
jewellery
,
which
be
of
very
considerable
value
.
<EOS>
and
upon
me
,
because
I
be
defenceless
,
the
guilt
be
place
.
<EOS>
They
say
I
be
jealous
of
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Suzette
,
"
I
say
slowly
,
"
leave
this
man
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
,
glance
towards
him
,
I
see
what
a
terrible
effect
her
denunciation
have
have
upon
him
.
<EOS>
pale
to
the
lip
,
he
stand
cowed
,
even
tremble
,
for
before
him
<EOS>
be
the
live
witness
of
his
crime
.
 
<EOS>
I
stand
with
my
back
to
the
door
,
bar
his
escape
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
I
say
,
"
what
be
your
defence
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
be
silent
.
 
<EOS>
I
repeat
my
question
in
a
hard
,
distinct
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
's
cry
quit
,
"
he
say
in
a
low
,
hoarse
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
preserve
your
secret
--
if
you
will
keep
mine
.
<EOS>
Will
you
not
accept
term
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
those
,
"
I
reply
promptly
.
<EOS>
"
Suzette
have
be
accuse
by
Banfield
,
and
by
you
,
of
the
crime
which
you
commit
.
<EOS>
She
shall
therefore
name
her
own
term
.
"
 
<EOS>
realise
that
,
by
the
fortunate
discovery
of
the
assassin
of
Madame
Levitsky
,
she
have
at
once
free
herself
from
the
trammel
cast
about
her
by
Banfield
,
it
be
not
surprising
that
the
girl
should
stipulate
as
a
condition
of
allow
the
spy
his
freedom
that
he
should
hand
over
to
me
all
the
copy
of
the
secret
diplomatic
correspondence
which
he
possess
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
he
loudly
protest
that
he
have
none
,
but
I
compel
him
to
hand
me
the
key
of
his
despatch
-
box
,
and
accompany
him
to
his
room
at
the
further
end
of
the
corridor
,
we
search
and
there
find
within
the
steel
box
a
file
of
paper
which
he
hold
ready
to
hand
over
to
the
Quai
d'Orsay
--
the
actual
information
of
which
I
have
be
in
such
active
search
.
 
<EOS>
the
german
inducement
be
all
set
out
clearly
and
concisely
,
the
copy
be
in
the
neat
hand
of
the
traitorous
clerk
in
the
Treaty
Department
.
 
<EOS>
Pierron
,
the
table
thus
turn
upon
him
,
beg
me
to
allow
him
at
least
to
have
copy
.
<EOS>
this
I
refuse
,
triumphantly
take
possession
of
the
whole
file
and
bid
him
good
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
in
an
hour
we
have
both
leave
the
german
capital
,
and
next
day
I
have
the
satisfaction
of
hand
the
copy
of
the
german
proposal
and
the
whole
correspondence
to
the
Minister
for
Foreign
Affairs
at

up

the
bitter
chagrin
of

and
possibly
on

allegation

CHAPTER
IX
 
<EOS>
the
SECRET
of
our
new
GUN
  
Ray
<EOS>
and
I
be
in
Newcastle
-
on
-
tyne
a
few
week
after
our
success
in
frustrate
the
german
plot
against
England
.
 
<EOS>
certain
observation
we
have
keep
have
lead
us
to
believe
that
a
frantic
endeavour
be
be
make
to
obtain
certain
detail
of
a
new
type
of
gun
,
of
enormous
power
and
range
,
which
at
that
moment
be
under
construction
at
the
Armstrong
Works
at
Elswick
.
 
<EOS>
the
Tyne
and
Tees
have
long
ago
be
survey
by
Germany
,
and
no
doubt
the
accurate
and
detailed
information
pigeon
-
hole
in
the
Intelligence
Bureau
at
Berlin
<EOS>
would
,
if
see
by
the
good
people
of
Newcastle
,
cause
them
a
_
mauvais
quart
d'heure
_
,
as
well
as
<EOS>
considerable
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
yet
there
be
one
or
two
secret
of
the
Tyne
and
its
defence
which
be
fortunately
not
yet
the
property
of
our
friend
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
Vera
be
in
Switzerland
with
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
but
from
our
quarter
at
the
Station
Hotel
in
Newcastle
we
make
many
careful
and
confidential
inquiry
.
<EOS>
We
discover
,
among
other
thing
,
the
existence
of
a
secret
german
club
in
a
back
street
off
Grainger
Street
,
and
the
member
of
this
institution
we
watch
narrowly
.
 
<EOS>
now
no
british
workman
will
willingly
give
away
any
secret
to
a
foreign
Power
,
and
we
do
not
suspect
that
any
one
employ
at
the
great
Elswick
Works
would
be
guilty
of
treachery
.
<EOS>
in
these
day
of
socialistic
,
fire
-
brand
oratory
there
be
always
,
however
,
the
danger
of
a
discharge
workman
make
revelation
with
object
of
private
vengeance
,
never
realise
that
it
be
a
nation
's
secret
that
he
may
be
betray
.
<EOS>
yet
in
the
course
of
a
fortnight
's
inquiry
we
learn
nothing
to
lead
us
to
suspect
that
our
enemy
would
obtain
the
information
they
seek
.
 
<EOS>
among
the
member
of
the
secret
german
club
--
which
,
by
the
way
,
include
in
its
membership
several
swiss
and
Belgians
--
be
a
middle
-
aged
man
who
go
by
the
name
of
John
Barker
,
but
who
be
either
a
german
or
a
Swede
,
and
whose
real
name
most
probably
end
in
"
burger
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
be
,
we
find
,
employ
as
foreign
-
correspondence
clerk
in
the
office
of
a
well
-
know
shipping
firm
,
and
amateur
photography
seem
his
chief
hobby
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
number
of
friend
,
one
of
whom
be
a
man
name
Charles
Rosser
,
a
highly
respectable
,
hardworke
man
,
who
be
a
foreman
fitter
at
Elswick
.
 
<EOS>
We
watch
the
pair
closely
,
for
our
suspicion
be
at
last
arouse
.
 
<EOS>
Rosser
often
spend
the
evening
with
his
friend
Barker
at
theatre
and
music
-
hall
,
and
it
be
evident
that
the
shipping
clerk
pay
for
everything
.
<EOS>
once
or
twice
Barker
go
out
to
Rosser
's
house
in
Dilston
Road
,
close
to
the
Nun
's
Moor
Recreation
Ground
,
and
there
spend
the
evening
with
his
wife
and
family
.
 
<EOS>
We
take
turn
at
keep
observation
,
but
one
night
Ray
,
who
have
be
out
follow
the
pair
,
enter
my
room
at
the
hotel
,
say
:
 
"
Barker
be
persuade
his
friend
to
buy
a
new
house
in
the
Bentinck
Road

<EOS>
It
be
a
small
,
neat
little
red

brick
villa
,
just
complete
,
and
the
price
be
three
hundred
and
fifty
pound
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
to
-
night
I
overhear
part
of
their
conversation
.
<EOS>
Barker
actually
offer
to
lend
his
friend
half
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah

<EOS>
"
I
cry
.
<EOS>
"
on
certain
condition
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
condition
be
mention
,
but
,
no
doubt
,
he
intend
to
get
poor
Rosser
into
his
toil
,
that
he
will
be
compel
to
supply
some
information
in
order
to
save
himself
and
his
family
from
ruin
.
<EOS>
the
spy
of
Germany
be
quite
unscrupulous
,
remember
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
remark
.
<EOS>
"
the
truth
be
quite
clear
.
<EOS>
We
must
protect
Rosser
from
this
.
<EOS>
He
be
no
doubt
tempt
the
unsuspecting
fellow
,
and
pose
as
a
man
of
mean
.
<EOS>
rosser
do
not
know
that
his
generous
friend
be
a
spy

"
 
<EOS>
for
the
next
few
day
it
fall
to
my
lot
to
watch
Barker
.
<EOS>
I
follow
him
on
Saturday
afternoon
to
Tynemouth
,
where
it
seem
his
hobby
be
to
snap
-
shoot
incoming
and
outgoing

,
at
the
same
time
ask
of

would
be

<EOS>
indeed
,
he

of
the
whole

.
 
<EOS>
He

he
make
many
note

<EOS>
all
this
he

in
full
presence
of
passer
-
by
,
and
even
of
the

,
for
who

<EOS>
about
six
o'clock
on
Sunday
afternoon
he
enter
the
Royal

take
off
his
light
overcoat
,
and
,
hang
it
in

<EOS>
I
have

I
take
off

<EOS>
but
I
do
not
enter

instead

I
go

<EOS>
there
I
call

have
swallow

there
feel
some

,
in
a
second

I
have
seize

<EOS>

the
fictitious
Lewis
,
we
afterwards
discover
,
occupy
a
small
office
in
Berkeley
Chambers
in
the
guise
of
a
commission
agent

be
no

the
travel

in

this

greatly
recommend

Secret

the
good

ingenious
of

<EOS>
when
I
return
I
show
my
treasure
to
Ray
,
who
at
once
become
excited

"
the

"
We

the

and
Rosser
be
inseparable

<EOS>
They
meet
each
evening
,
and
more
than
once
the
whole
Rosser
family
go
out
to
entertainment
at
Mr.
Barker
's
expense
.
<EOS>
He
would
allow
the
foreman
fitter
to
pay
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
judicious
inquiry
at
Elswick
reveal
the
fact
that
Charles
Rosser
be
one
of
the
most
skilful
fitter
in
the
employ
of
the
firm
,
and
that
such
be
the
confidence
place
in
him
,
that
he
be
at
present
engage
in
the
finishing
of
the
new
gun
which
be
to
be
a
triumph
of
the
British
Navy
--
a
weapon
which
be
far
and
away
in
advance
of
any
possess
by
any
other
nation
,
or
anything
ever
turn
out
from
Krupp
's
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
ticklish
and
exciting
work
,
watch
the
two
man
and
observe
the
subtle
craftiness
of
the
German
,
who
be
try
to
get
the
honest
Englishman
into
his
power
.
<EOS>
but
in
our
self
-
impose
campaign
of
contra
-
espionage
we
have
have
many
stir
adventure
,
and
after
all
,
our
life
in
Newcastle
be
not
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
Barker
be
engage
at
his
office
all
day
,
and
we
be
then
free
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
at
evening
when
we
be
compel
to
adopt
those
hundred
and
one
subterfuge
,
and
whenever
the
watching
be
wearisome
and
chill
we
always
recollect
that
we
be
perform
a
patriotic
duty
,
even
though
it
be
silent
,
unknown
,
and
unrecognised
.
 
<EOS>
one
night
the
pair
be
together
in
a
bar
in
Westgate
Road
,
when
,
from
their
conversation
,
it
be
make
very
clear
to
me
that
Barker
have
advance
his
friend
one
hundred
and
seventy
-
five
pound
,
and
that
the
deed
of
the
new
house
be
to
be
sign
next
day
.
<EOS>
Rosser
be
extremely
grateful
to
his
friend
.
<EOS>
half
the
purchase
-
money
be
to
remain
on
mortgage
--
a
mortgage
make
over
to
Barker
himself
--
just
as
we
have
expect
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
clink
glass
,
and
it
be
plain
that
Rosser
have
not
the
least
suspicion
of
the
abyss
open
before
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
some
man
who
be
entirely
unsuspecting
,
and
perhaps
the
british
workman
be
most
of
all
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
report
this
to
Ray
and
we
have
consult
together
,
we
decide
that
the
time
be
ripe
to
approach
Rosser
and
expose
his
generous
friend
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
quite
plain
to
us
that
Barker
would
quickly
bring
pressure
to
bear
upon
the
foreman
fitter
to
either
supply
a
drawing
and
rough
specification
of
the
new
gun
,
or
else
come
face
to
face
with
ruin
.
<EOS>
We
have
ascertain
that
,
though
an
honest
workman
,
Rosser
only
live
upon
his
weekly
wage
,
and
have
nothing
put
by
for
the
support
of
his
wife
and
four
child
.
<EOS>
the
patriotic
scruple
of
a
man
be
not
difficult
to
overcome
when
he
see
his
wife
and
family
in
danger
of
starvation
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
next
evening
we
follow
Rosser
from
his
work
up
to
Dilston
Road
and
call
at
his
clean
and
humble
home
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
he
greatly
resent
our
intrusion
,
and
be
most
indignant
at
our
suggestion
that
he
be
about
to
be
make
a
cat's
-
paw
by
the
Kaiser
's
spy
.
 
<EOS>
but
on
production
of
the
letter
,
which
we
decipher
,
the
plan
of
the
Ridges
Waterworks
,
and
our
allegation
concern
his
generous
friend
,
he
begin
to
reflect
.
 
<EOS>
"
have
he
ever
ask
you
about
the
new
gun
now
be
make
at
Elswick
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well"--he
<EOS>
hesitated--"now
<EOS>
I
recall
the
fact
,
he
have
on
several
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
He
intend

you

you
to

<EOS>
"
He
would
never
do
that
!
<EOS>
"
declare
the
stout
-
hearted
Briton

"
<EOS>
by
God
!
<EOS>
if
what
you
tell
me
be
true
,
"
he
cry
fiercely
,
"
I
will
wring
the
blackguard
's
neck
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
I
say
,
"
do
not
do
that

<EOS>
He
be
pay
the
purchase
money
for
a
new
house
for
you
,
have
not
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
leave
him
to
us
.
<EOS>
We
will
compel
him
to
hand
back
the
mortgage
,
and
your
revenge
shall
be
a
new
house
at
the
expense
of
the
german
Government
,
"
whereat
both
Ray
and
he
laugh
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
next
night
we
face
the
spy
at
his
own
room
,
and
on
pain
of
exposure
and
the
police
compel
him
to
hand
over
the
new
little
villa
to
his
intended
victim
unconditionally
,
a
fact
which
cause
him
the
most
intense
chagrin
,
and
induce
him
to
utter
the
most
fearful
threat
of
vengeance
against
us
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
have
already
have
many
such
threat
.
<EOS>
so
we
only
laugh
at
them
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
,
however
,
the
satisfaction
of
expose
the
spy
to
the
firm
which
employ
him
,
and
we
be
present
on
the
platform
of
the
Central
Station
when
,
two
day
later
,
have
give
up
his
room
and
pack
his
belonging
,
he
leave
the
Tyne
-
side
for
London
,
evidently
to
consult
his
travelling
-
inspector
,
"
Henry
Lewis
.
"
 
<EOS>
several
month
pass
.
<EOS>
the
attempt
to
obtain
detail
of
our
new
gun
have
pass
completely
from
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
an
inquiry
which
Ray
and
I
have
be
actively
prosecute
into
an
attempt
to
learn
the
secret
of
the
"
transmitting
-
room
"
of
our
new
_
Dreadnoughts
_
have
lead
me
to
the
south
of
Germany
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
a
rather
exciting
experience
in
Dresden
and
be
now
on
my
way
back
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
Your
London

such
a
strange
place
.
<EOS>
so
dull
,
so
_
triste_--so
very
damp
and
foggy

remark
the
girl
seat
in
the
train
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
always
,
mademoiselle
,
"
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
be
there
in
winter
.
<EOS>
You
should
go
in
June

<EOS>
in
the
season
it
be
as
pleasant
as
anywhere
else
in
the
world

"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
desire
to
return
.
<EOS>
and
yet----
"
 
"
well
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
yet
I
have
decide
to
go
straight
on
from
the
Gare
du
Nord
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
midday
service
!
<EOS>
I
shall
cross
by
that
also
.
<EOS>
We
shall
be
fellow
-
traveller
,
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
together
in
the
night
<EOS>
_
rapide
_
from
Berlin
to
Paris
,
and
have
just
leave
the
great
echoing
station
of
Cologne
,
with
few
stop
between
there
and
Paris
.
<EOS>
day
be
break
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
meet
Julie
Granier
under
curious
circumstance
only
a
few
hour
before
.
 
<EOS>
at
Berlin
,
be
know
to
the
controller
of
the
Wagon
-
lit
Company
,
I
be
at
once
give
a
two
-
berth
compartment
in
the
long
,
dusty
sleeping
-
car
,
those
big
carriage
in
which
I
so
often
spend
day
,
and
night
too
,
for
the
matter
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
"
M'sieur
be
for
Paris
?
"
<EOS>
ask
the
brown
-
uniformed
conductor
as
I
enter
,
and
after
fling
in
my
trap
,
I
descend
,
go
to
the
buffet
and
have
a
mazagran
and
cigarette
until
our
departure
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
sit
there
more
than
five
minute
when
the
conductor
,
a
man
with
whom
I
have
travel
a
dozen
time
,
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
,
and
,
see
me
,
withdraw
.
<EOS>
then
,
a
few
moment
later
,
he
enter
with
a
tall
,
dark
-
haired
,
good
-
looking
girl
,
who
stand
aside
as
he
approach
me
,
cap
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
excuse
me
,
m'sieur
,
but
a
lady
wish
to
ask
a
great
favour
of
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
me
?
<EOS>
what
be
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
,
rise
.
 
<EOS>
glance
at
the
tall
figure
in
black
,
I
see
that
she
be
not
more
than
twenty
-
two
at
the
outside
,
and
that
she
have
the
bearing
and
manner
of
a
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
m'sieur
,
she
will
explain
herself
,
"
the
man
say
,
whereupon
the
fair
stranger
approach
bow
,
and
exclaim
:
 
"
I
trust
m'sieur
will
pardon
me
for
what
I
be
about
to
ask
,
"
she
say
in
French
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
be
great
presumption
on
my
part
,
a
total
stranger
,
but
the
fact
be
that
I
be
bind
to
get
to
Paris
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
It
be
imperative
--
most
imperative
--
that
I
should
be
there
and
keep
an
appointment
.
<EOS>
I
find
,
however
,
that
all
the
berth
be
take
,
and
that
the
only
vacant
one
be
in
your
compartment
.
<EOS>
I
thought----
"
<EOS>
and
she
hesitate
,
with
downcast
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
mean
that
you
want
me
to
allow
you
to
travel
here
,
mademoiselle
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
with
a
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
m'sieur
!
<EOS>
if
you
would
;
if
you
only
would
!
<EOS>
It
would
be
an
act
of
friendship
that
I
would
never
forget
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
see
my
hesitation
,
and
I
detect
how
anxious
she
become
.
<EOS>
Her
gloved
hand
be
tremble
,
and
she
seem
agitated
and
pale
to
the
lip
.
 
<EOS>
again
I
scrutinise
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
of
the
spy
or
adventuress
about
her
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
she
seem
a
very
charmingly
modest
young
woman
,
for
in
continuation
of
her
request
she
suggest
that
she
could
sit
in
the
conductor
's
seat
in
the
corridor
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
surely
that
would
be
rather
wearisome
,
mademoiselle
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
must
get
to
Paris
at
all
cost
.
<EOS>
ah
,
m'sieur
!
<EOS>
You
will
allow
me
to
do
as
I
ask
,
will
you
not
?
<EOS>
do
.
<EOS>
I
implore
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
make
no
reply
,
for
truth
to
tell
,
although
I
be
not
suspicious
,
I
hesitate
to
allow
the
fair
stranger
to
be
my
travel
companion
.
<EOS>
It
be
against
my
principle
.
<EOS>
yet
read
disinclination
in
my
silence
,
she
continue
:
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
m'sieur
!
<EOS>
if
you
only
know
in
what
deadly
peril
I
be
!
<EOS>
by
grant
this
favour
to
me
you
can"--and
<EOS>
she
break
off
short
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
"
she
go
on
,
"
I
may
as
well
tell
you
the
truth
,
m'sieur
,
"
and
in
her
eye
there
be
a
strange
look
that
I
have
never
see
in
those
of
any
woman
before
,
"
you
can
save
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
life
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
echo
,
but
at
that
moment
the
sleep
-
car
conductor
,
stand
at
the
buffet
-
door
,
call
:
 
"
_
<EOS>
En
voiture
_
,
m'sieur
.
<EOS>
the
train
be
just
start
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
take
me
,
"
implore
the
girl
.
<EOS>
"
do
,
m'sieur
.
<EOS>
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
time
for
further
discussion
,
therefore
I
do
as
she
request
,
and
a
few
moment
later
,
with
a
dressing
-
case
,
which
be
all
the
baggage
she
have
,
she
mount
into
the
_
wagon
-
lit
_
,
and
we
move
off
to
the
french
capital
.
 
<EOS>
I
offer
her
the
sleeping
-
compartment
to
herself
,
but
she
steadily
refuse
to
accept
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
m'sieur
,
certainly
not
,
"
be
her
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
sit
in
the
corridor
all
night
,
as
I
have
already
say
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
hour
after
hour
,
while
all
the
passenger
have
retire
to
rest
,
we
sit
at
the
end
of
the
car
and
chat
.
<EOS>
I
ask
her
if
she
like
a
cigarette
,
and
she
gladly
accept
.
<EOS>
so
we
smoke
together
,
while
she
tell
me
something
of
herself
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
native
of
Orleans
,
where
her
people
have
be
wealthy
landowner
,
she
say
,
but
some
unfortunate
speculation
on
her
father
's
part
bring
ruin
to
them
,
and
she
be
now
governess
in
the
family
of
a
certain
Baron
de
Moret
,
of
the
Chateau
de
Moret
,
near
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
a
governess
!
<EOS>
I
have
believe
from
her
dress
and
manner
that
she
be
at
least
the
daughter
of
some
french
aristocrat
,
and
I
confess
I
be
disappointed
to
find
that
she
be
only
a
superior
servant
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
come
from
Breslau
,
"
she
explain
.
<EOS>
"
on
very
urgent
business
--
business
that
concern
my
own
self
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
not
in
Paris
this
morning
I
shall
,
in
all
probability
,
pay
the
penalty
with
my
life
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
how
?
<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
in
the
grey
dawn
as
the
express
roar
on
towards
Paris
I
see
that
her
countenance
be
that
of
a
woman
who
hold
a
secret
.
<EOS>
at
first
I
have
be
conscious
that
there
be
something
unusual
about
her
,
and
suspect
her
to
be
an
adventuress
,
but
now
,
on
further
acquaintance
,
I
become
convinced
that
she
hold
possession
of
some
knowledge
that
she
be
yearn
to
betray
,
yet
fear
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
one
fact
that
strike
me
as
curious
be
that
,
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
,
she
show
that
she
know
my
destination
be
London
.
<EOS>
at
first
this
puzzle
me
,
but
on
reflection
I
see
that
the
conductor
,
know
me
,
have
tell
her
.
 
<EOS>
at
Erquelinnes
we
have
descend
and
have
our
early
_
cafe
complet
_
,
and
now
as
we
rush
onward
to
the
capital
she
have
suddenly
make
up
her
mind
to
go
through
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
"
when
we
arrive
in
Paris
I
must
leave
you
to
keep
my
appointment
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
meet
again
at
the
Gare
du
Nord
--
at
the
Calais
train
,
eh
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
most
certainly
,
"
be
the
reply
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
<EOS>
she
sigh
,
look
straight
into
my
face
with
those
dark
eye
that
be
so
luminous
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
--
you
can
never
guess
what
a
great
service
you
have
render
me
by
allow
me
to
travel
here
with
you
.
<EOS>
My
peril
be
the
grave
that
--
well
,
that
ever
threaten
a
woman
--
yet
now
,
by
your
aid
,
I
shall
be
able
to
save
myself
.
<EOS>
otherwise
,
to
-
morrow
my
body
would
have
be
expose
in
the
Morgue
--
the
corpse
of
a
woman
unknown
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
these
word
of
yours
interest
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
m'sieur
!
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
and
I
can
not
tell
you
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
secret
--
ah
!
<EOS>
if
I
only
dare
speak
<EOS>
you
would
help
me
,
I
know
,
"
and
I
see
in
her
face
a
look
full
of
apprehension
and
distress
.
 
<EOS>
as
she
raise
her
hand
to
push
the
dark
hair
from
her
brow
,
as
though
it
oppress
her
,
my
eye
catch
sight
of
something
glisten
upon
her
wrist
,
half
conceal
by
the
lace
on
her
sleeve
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
magnificent
diamond
bangle
.
 
<EOS>
surely
such
an
ornament
would
not
be
wear
by
a
mere
governess
!
<EOS>
I
look
again
into
her
handsome
face
,
and
wonder
if
she
be
deceive
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
if
it
be
in
my
power
to
assist
you
,
mademoiselle
,
I
will
do
so
with
the
great
pleasure
.
<EOS>
but
,
of
course
,
I
can
not
without
know
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
I
regret
that
my
lip
be
close
concern
them
,
"
she
sigh
,
look
straight
before
her
despairingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
fear
to
go
alone
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
my
enemy
no
longer
,
"
be
her
reply
as
she
glance
at
the
little
gold
watch
in
her
belt
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
in
Paris
before
noon
--
thank
to
you
,
m'sieur
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
when
you
first
make
the
request
I
have
no
idea
of
the
urgency
of
your
journey
,
"
I
remark
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
be
glad
,
very
glad
,
that
I
have
have
an
opportunity
of
render
you
some
slight
service
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Slight
,
m'sieur
?
<EOS>
why
,
you
have
save
me
!
<EOS>
I
owe
you
a
debt
which
I
can
never
repay
--
never
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
lace
at
her
throat
rise
and
fall
as
she
sigh
<EOS>
,
her
wonderful
eye
still
fix
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
gradually
the
wintry
sun
rise
over
the
bare
,
frozen
wine
-
land
over
which
we
be
speed
,
when
with
a
sudden
application
of
the
brake
we
pull
up
at
a
little
station
for
a
change
of
engine
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
after
three
minute
,
we
be
off
again
,
until
at
nine
o'clock
we
run
slowly
into
the
huge
terminus
in
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
tidy
her
hair
,
wash
,
brush
her
dress
,
and
,
as
I
assist
her
to
alight
<EOS>
,
she
bear
no
trace
of
her
long
journey
across
Germany
and
France
.
<EOS>
strange
how
well
french
woman
travel
!
<EOS>
english
woman
be
always
tousle
and
tumble
after
a
night
journey
,
but
a
french
or
italian
woman
never
.
 
<EOS>
"
_
Au

,
m'sieur
,
till
twelve
at
the
Gare
du
Nord

"
she
exclaim
,
with
a
merry
smile
and
a
bow
as
she
drive
away
in
a
cab
,
leave
me
upon
the
kerb
gaze
after
her
and
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
be
she
really
a
governess
,
as
she
pretend
?
 
<EOS>
Her
clothe
,
her
manner
,
her
smart
chatter
,
her
exquisite
_
chic
_
,
all
reveal
good
breeding
and
a
high
station
in
life
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
touch
of
cheap
shabbiness
--
or
at
least
I
could
not
detect
it
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
moment
before
twelve
she
alight
at
the
Gare
du
Nord
and
greet
me
merrily
.
<EOS>
Her
face
be
slightly
flush
,
and
I
think
her
hand
tremble
as
I
take
it
.
<EOS>
but
together
we
walk
to
the
train
,
wherein
I
have
already
secure
seat
and
place
in
the
_
wagon
-
restaurant
_
.
 
<EOS>
the
railway
official
,
the
controller
of
the
train
,
the
chief
of
the
restaurant
,
and
other
official
,
recognise
me
,
salute
,
whereupon
she
say
:
 
"
You
seem
very
well
know
in
Paris
,
m'sieur
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
a
constant
traveller
,
"
I
reply
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
a
little
too
constant
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
one
get
weary
with
such
continual
travel
as
I
be
force
to
undertake
.
<EOS>
I
never
know
to
-
morrow
where
I
may
be
,
and
I
move
swiftly
from
one
capital
to
another
,
never
spend
more
than
a
day
or
two
in
the
same
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
it
must
be
very
pleasant
to
travel
so
much
,
"
she
declare
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
love
to
be
able
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
be
passionately
fond
of
constant
change
.
"
 
<EOS>
together
we
travel
to
Calais
,
cross
to
Dover
,
and
that
same
evening
alight
at
Victoria
.
 
<EOS>
on
our
journey
to
London
she
give
me
an
address
in
the
Vauxhall
Bridge
Road
,
where
,
she
say
,
a
letter
would
find
her
.
<EOS>
She
refuse
to
tell
me
her
destination
,
or
to
allow
me
to
see
her
into
a
hansom
.
<EOS>
this
latter
fact
cause
me
considerable
reflection
.
<EOS>
why
have
she
so
suddenly
make
up
her
mind
to
come
to
London
,
and
why
should
I
not
know
whither
she
go
when
she
have
tell
me
so
many
detail
concern
herself
?
 
<EOS>
of
one
fact
I
feel
quite
convinced
,
namely
,
that
she
have
lie
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
a
governess
,
as
she
pretend
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
have
be
seize
by
suspicion
that
a
tall
,
thin
-
faced
,
elderly
man
,
rather
shabbily
dress
,
whom
I
have
notice
on
the
platform
in
Paris
,
have
follow
us
.
<EOS>
He
have
travel
second
-
class
,
and
,
on
alight
at
Victoria
,
have
quickly
make
his
way
through
the
crowd
until
he
linger
quite
close
to
us
as
I
wish
her
farewell
.
 
<EOS>
His
reappearance
there
recall
to
me
that
he
have
watch
us
as
we
have
walk
up
and
down
the
platform
of
the
Gare
du
Nord
,
and
have
appear
intensely
interested
in
all
our
movement
.
<EOS>
whether
my
pretty
travelling
companion
notice
him
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
I
,
however
,
follow
her
as
she
walk
out
of
the
station
carry
her
dressing
-
bag
,
and
see
the
tall
man
stride
after
her
.
<EOS>
Adventurer
be
write
upon
the
fellow
's
face
.
<EOS>
His
grey
moustache
be
upturned
,
and
his
keen
grey
eye
look
out
from
beneath
shaggy
brow
,
while
his
dark
,
thread
-
bare
overcoat
be
tightly
button
across
his
chest
for
great
warmth
.
 
<EOS>
without
approach
her
he
stand
back
in
the
shadow
and
see
her
enter
a
hansom
in
the
station
-
yard
and
drive
out
into
Buckingham
Palace
Road
.
<EOS>
It
be
clear
that
she
be
not
go
to
the
address
she
have
give
me
,
for
she
be
drive
in
the
opposite
direction
.
 
<EOS>
My
duty
be
to
drive
direct
to
Bruton
Street
to
see
Ray
and
report
what
I
have
discover
,
but
so
interested
be
I
in
the
thin
-
faced
watcher
that
I
give
over
my
wrap
to
a
porter
who
know
me
,
exchange
my
heavy
travelling
-
coat
for
a
light
one
I
happen
to
have
,
and
walk
out
to
keep
further
observation
upon
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
have
not
mademoiselle
declare
herself
to
be
in
danger
of
her
life
?
<EOS>
if
so
,
be
it
not
possible
that
this
fellow
,
whoever
he
be
,
be
a
secret
assassin
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
the
aspect
of
the
affair
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
warn
her
against
him
,
and
I
now
become
fill
with
regret
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
complete
mystery
,
and
as
I
dog
the
footstep
of
the
unknown
foreigner
--
for
that
he
undoubtedly
be
--
<EOS>
I
become
more
deeply
interested
in
what
be
in
progress
.
 
<EOS>
He
walk
to
Trafalgar
Square
,
where
he
hesitate
in
such
a
manner
as
to
show
that
he
be
not
well
acquaint
with
London
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
which
of
the
converging
thoroughfare
to
take
.
<EOS>
at
last
he
inquire
of
the
constable
on
point
-
duty
,
and
then
go
up
St.
Martin
's
Lane
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
have
turn
I
approach
the
policeman
,
and
ask
what
the
stranger
want
,
explain
that
he
be
a
suspicious
character
whom
I
be
follow
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
E
be
a
Frenchman
,
sir
.
'
<EOS>
e
want
Burton
Crescent
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
where
be
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
just
off
the
Euston
Road
--
close
to
Judd
Street
.
<EOS>
I
have
tell
'
i
be
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
I
enter
a
hansom
and
drive
to
the
place
in
question
,
a
semicircle
of
dark
-
looking
,
old
-
fashioned
house
of
the
Bloomsbury
type
--
most
of
them
let
out
in
apartment
.
<EOS>
then
alight
,
I
loiter
for
half
an
hour
up
and
down
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
at
last
,
his
tall
,
meagre
figure
loom
dark
in
the
lamp
-
light
.
<EOS>
very
eagerly
he
walk
round
the
Crescent
,
examine
the
number
of
the
house
,
until
he
come
to
one
rather
clean
than
the
other
,
of
which
he
take
careful
observation
.
 
<EOS>
I
,
too
,
take
note
of
the
number
.
 
<EOS>
afterwards
the
stranger
turn
into
the
Euston
Road
,
cross
to
King
's
Cross
Station
,
where
he
send
a
telegram
,
and
then
go
to
one
of
the
small
uninviting
private
hotel
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
have
see
him
there
,
I
return
to
Burton
Crescent
,
and
for
an
hour
watch
the
house
,
wonder
whether
Julie
Granier
have
take
up
her
abode
there
.
<EOS>
to
me
it
seem
as
though
the
stranger
have
overhear
the
direction
she
have
give
the
cabman
.
 
<EOS>
the
window
of
the
house
be
close
by
green
venetian
blind
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
that
there
be
light
in
most
of
the
room
,
while
over
the
fanlight
of
the
front
door
be
a
small
transparent
square
of
glass
.
<EOS>
the
front
step
be
well
keep
,
and
in
the
deep
basement
be
a
well
-
light
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
there
about
half
an
hour
when
the
door
open
,
and
a
middle
-
aged
man
in
evening
dress
,
and
wear
a
black
overcoat
and
crush
hat
,
emerge
.
<EOS>
His
dark
face
be
an
aristocratic
one
,
and
as
he
descend
the
step
he
draw
on
his
white
glove
,
for
he
be
evidently
on
his
way
to
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
I
take
good
notice
of
his
face
,
for
it
be
a
striking
countenance
,
one
which
once
see
could
never
be
forget
.
 
<EOS>
a
man
-
servant
behind
him
blow
a
cab
-
whistle
,
a
hansom
draw
up
,
and
he
drive
away
.
<EOS>
then
I
walk
up
and
down
in
the
vicinity
,
keep
a
weary
vigil
,
for
my
curiosity
be
now
much
excited
.
<EOS>
the
stranger
mean
mischief
.
<EOS>
of
that
I
be
certain
.
 
<EOS>
the
one
point
I
wish
to
clear
up
be
whether
Julie
Granier
be
actually
within
that
house
.
<EOS>
but
though
I
watch
until
I
become
half
frozen
in
the
drizzling
rain
,
all
be
in
vain
.
<EOS>
so
I
take
a
cab
and
drive
to
Bruton
Street
.
 
<EOS>
that
same
night
,
when
I
get
to
my
room
,
I
write
a
line
to
the
address
that
Julie
have
give
me
,
ask
whether
she
would
make
an
appointment
to
meet
me
,
as
I
wish
to
give
her
some
very
important
information
concern
herself
,
and
to
this
,
on
the
follow
day
,
I
receive
a
reply
ask
me
to
call
at
the
house
in
Burton
Crescent
that
evening
at
nine
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
naturally
I
go
.
<EOS>
My
surmise
be
correct
that
the
house
watch
by
the
stranger
be
her
abode
.
<EOS>
the
fellow
be
keep
observation
upon
it
with
some
evil
intent
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
-
servant
,
on
admit
me
,
show
me
into
a
well
-
furnish
drawing
-
room
on
the
first
floor
,
where
sit
my
pretty
travelling
companion
ready
to
receive
me
.
 
<EOS>
in
French
she
greet
me
very
warmly
,
bade
me
be
seat
,
and
after
some
preliminary
inquire
the
nature
of
the
information
which
I
wish
to
impart
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
very
briefly
I
tell
her
of
the
shabby
watcher
<EOS>
,
whereupon
she
spring
to
her
foot
with
a
cry
of
mingled
terror
and
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
describe
him
--
quickly
!
"
<EOS>
she
urge
in
breathless
agitation
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
so
,
and
she
sit
back
again
in
her
chair
,
stare
straight
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
she
gasp
,
her
countenance
pale
as
death
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
they
mean
revenge
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
very
well
!
<EOS>
now
that
I
be
forewarn
I
shall
know
how
to
act
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
rise
,
and
pace
the
room
in
agitation
push
back
the
dark
hair
from
her
brow
.
<EOS>
then
her
hand
clench
themselves
,
and
her
tooth
be
set
,
for
she
be
desperate
.
 
<EOS>
the
shabby
man
be
an
emissary
of
her
enemy
.
<EOS>
She
tell
me
as
much
.
<EOS>
yet
in
all
she
say
be
mystery
.
<EOS>
at
one
moment
I
be
convince
that
she
have
tell
the
truth
when
she
say
she
be
a
governess
,
and
at
the
next
I
suspect
her
of
try
to
deceive
.
 
<EOS>
presently
,
after
she
have
hand
me
a
cigarette
,
the
servant
tap
the
door
,
and
a
well
-
dress
man
enter
--
<EOS>
the
same
man
I
have
see
leave
the
house
two
night
previously
.
 
<EOS>
"
May
I
introduce
you
?
"
<EOS>
mademoiselle
ask
.
<EOS>
"
M'sieur
Jacox
--
M'sieur
le
Baron
de
Moret
.
"
 
"
charm
to
make
your
acquaintance
,
sir
,
"
the
Baron
say
,
grasp
my
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
here
have
already
speak
of
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
the
satisfaction
be
mutual
,
I
assure
you
,
Baron
,
"
be
my
reply
,
and
then
we
reseat
ourselves
and
begin
to
chat
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
mademoiselle
make
some
remark
in
a
language
--
<EOS>
some
slav
language
--
which
I
do
not
understand
.
<EOS>
the
effect
it
have
upon
the
newcomer
be
almost
electrical
.
<EOS>
He
start
from
his
seat
,
glare
at
her
.
<EOS>
then
he
begin
to
question
her
rapidly
in
the
unknown
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
flashily
dress
man
of
overbearing
manner
,
with
a
thick
neck
and
square
,
determined
chin
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
evident
that
the
warning
I
have
give
them
arouse
their
apprehension
,
for
they
hold
a
rapid
consultation
,
and
then
Julie
go
out
,
return
with
another
man
,
a
dark
-
haired
,
low
-
breed
look
foreigner
,
who
speak
the
same
tongue
as
his
companion
.
 
<EOS>
They
disregard
my
presence
altogether
in
their
eager
consultation
;
therefore
I
rise
to
go
,
for
I
see
that
I
be
not
want
.
 
<EOS>
Julie
hold
my
hand
and
look
into
my
eye
in
mute
appeal
.
<EOS>
She
appear
anxious
to
say
something
to
me
in
private
.
<EOS>
at
least
that
be
my
impression
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
leave
the
house
I
pass
,
at
the
end
of
the
Crescent
,
a
shabby
man
idly
smoke
.
<EOS>
be
he
one
of
the
watcher
?
 
<EOS>
four
day
go
by
.
 
<EOS>
one
evening
I
be
pass
through
the
red
-
carpet
hall
of
the
Savoy
Hotel
when
a
neatly
dress
figure
in
black
rose
and
greet
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
Julie
,
who
seem
to
have
be
await
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
May
I
speak
to
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
ask
breathlessly
,
when
we
have
exchange
greeting
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
apologise
for
the
manner
in
which
I
treat
you
the
other
evening
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
assure
her
that
no
apology
be
need
,
and
together
we
seat
ourselves
in
a
corner
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
really
ought
not
to
trouble
you
with
my
affair
,
"
she
say
presently
,
in
an
apologetic
tone
.
<EOS>
"
but
you
remember
what
I
tell
you
when
you
so
kindly
allow
me
to
travel
by
the
_
wagon
-
lit_--i
mean
of
my
peril
?
"
 
"
certainly
.
<EOS>
but
I
think
it
be
all
over
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
foolishly
believe
that
it
be
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
watch
--
I
--
I'm
a
mark
woman
.
"
<EOS>
then
,
after
some
hesitation
,
she
add
,
"
I
wonder
if
you
would
do
me
another
favour
.
<EOS>
You
could
save
my
life
,
M'sieur
Jacox
,
if
you
only
would
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
if
I
can
render
you
such
a
service
,
mademoiselle
,
I
shall
be
only
too
delighted
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
at
present
my
plan
be
immature
,
"
she
answer
after
a
pause
.
"
<EOS>
but
why
not
dine
with
me
to
-
morrow
night
?
<EOS>
We
have
some
friend
,
but
we
shall
be
able
to
escape
them
and
discuss
the
matter
alone
.
<EOS>
do
come
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
accept
,
and
<EOS>
she
,
take
a
taxi
in
the
Strand
,
drive
off
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
following
night
at
eight
I
enter
the
comfortable
drawing
-
room
in
Burton
Crescent
,
where
three
well
-
dress
man
and
three
rather
smart
lady
be
assemble
,
include
my
hostess
.
<EOS>
They
be
all
foreigner
,
and
among
them
be
the
Baron
,
who
appear
to
be
the
most
honoured
guest
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
quite
plain
that
,
instead
of
be
a
governess
as
she
have
assert
,
my
friend
be
a
lady
of
good
family
,
and
the
Baron
's
social
equal
.
 
<EOS>
the
party
be
a
very
pleasant
one
,
and
there
be
considerable
merriment
at
table
.
<EOS>
My
hostess
's
apprehension
of
the
previous
day
have
all
disappear
,
while
the
Baron
's
demeanour
be
one
of
calm
security
.
 
<EOS>
I
sit
at
her
left
hand
,
and
she
be
particularly
gracious
to
me
,
the
whole
conversation
at
table
be
in
French
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
after
dessert
,
the
Baron
remark
that
,
as
it
be
his
birthday
,
we
should
have
snap
-
dragon
,
and
,
with
his
hostess
's
permission
,
leave
the
dining
-
room
and
prepare
it
.
<EOS>
presently
it
appear
in
a
big
antique
Worcester
bowl
,
and
be
place
on
the
table
close
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
electric
light
be
switch
off
and
the
spirit
ignite
.
 
<EOS>
next
moment
with
shout
of
laughter
,
the
blue
flame
shed
a
weird
light
upon
our
face
,
we
be
pull
the
plum
out
of
the
fire
--
a
childish
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
place
one
in
my
mouth
,
and
swallow
it
,
but
as
I
be
take
a
second
from
the
blue
flame
,
I
suddenly
feel
a
faintness
.
<EOS>
at
first
I
put
it
down
to
the
heat
of
the
room
,
but
a
moment
later
I
feel
a
sharp
spasm
through
my
heart
,
and
my
brain
swell
too
large
for
my
skull
.
<EOS>
My
jaw
be
set
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
speak
,
but
be
unable
to
articulate
a
word
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
fun
have
stop
,
and
the
face
of
all
be
turn
upon
me
anxiously
.
<EOS>
the
Baron
have
rise
,
and
his
dark
countenance
peer
into
mine
with
a
fiendish
murderous
expression
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
ill
!
<EOS>
"
I
gasp
.
<EOS>
"
I
--
I'm
sure
I
be
poison
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
face
of
all
smile
again
,
while
the
Baron
utter
some
word
which
I
could
not
understand
,
and
then
there
be
a
dead
silence
,
all
still
watch
me
intently
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
fiend
!
<EOS>
"
I
cry
,
with
a
great
effort
,
as
I
struggle
to
rise
.
<EOS>
"
what
have
I
do
to
you
that
you
should--_poison
--
me
_
?
"
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
the
Baron
grin
in
my
face
,
and
that
I
fall
forward
heavily
upon
the
table
,
my
heart
grip
in
the
spasm
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
of
what
occur
afterwards
<EOS>
I
have
no
recollection
,
for
,
when
I
slowly
regain
knowledge
of
thing
around
me
<EOS>
,
I
find
myself
,
cramp
and
cold
,
lie
beneath
a
bare
,
leafless
hedge
in
a
grass
field
.
<EOS>
I
manage
to
struggle
to
my
foot
and
discover
myself
in
a
bare
,
flat
,
open
country
.
<EOS>
as
far
as
I
could
judge
it
be
midday
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
to
a
gate
,
skirt
a
hedge
,
and
gain
the
main
road
.
<EOS>
with
difficulty
I
walk
to
the
near
town
,
a
distance
of
about
four
mile
,
without
meet
a
soul
,
and
to
my
surprise
find
myself
in
Hitchin
.
<EOS>
the
spectacle
of
a
man
enter
the
town
in
evening
dress
and
hatless
in
broad
daylight
be
,
no
doubt
,
curious
,
but
I
be
anxious
to
return
to
London
and
give
information
against
those
who
have
,
without
any
apparent
motive
,
lay
an
ingenious
plot
to
poison
me
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
old
Sun
Inn
,
which
motorist
from
London
know
<EOS>
so
well
,
I
learn
that
the
time
be
eleven
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
the
only
manner
in
which
I
could
account
for
my
presence
in
Hitchin
be
that
,
believe
to
be
dead
by
the
Baron
and
his
accomplice
<EOS>
,
I
have
be
convey
in
a
motor
-
car
to
the
spot
where
I
be
find
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
shilling
remain
in
my
pocket
,
and
,
strangely
enough
,
beside
me
when
I
recover
consciousness
<EOS>
I
have
find
a
small
flute
phial
mark
"
prussic
acid
--
poison
.
<EOS>
"
the
assassin
have
attempt
to
make
it
apparent
that
I
have
commit
suicide
!
 
<EOS>
two
hour
later
,
after
a
rest
and
a
wash
,
I
borrow
an
overcoat
and
golf
-
cap
and
take
the
train
to
King
's
Cross
.
 
<EOS>
at
Judd
Street
Police
Station
I
make
a
statement
,
and
with
two
plain
-
clothe
officer
return
to
the
house
in
Burton
Crescent
,
only
to
find
that
the
fair
Julie
and
her
friend
have
fly
.
 
<EOS>
on
force
the
door
,
we
find
the
dining
-
table
just
as
it
have
be
leave
after
the
poisoned
snap

dragon
of
the
previous
night
.
<EOS>
nothing
have
be
touch
.
<EOS>
only
Julie
,
the
Baron
,
the
man
-
servant
,
and
the
guest
have
all
go
,
and
the
place
be
desert
.
 
<EOS>
the
police
be
utterly
puzzle
at
the
entire
absence
of
motive
.
 
<EOS>
on
my
return
to
Guilford
Street
I
at
once
telephone
to
Ray
,
and
he
be
quickly
with
me
,
Vera
accompany
him

<EOS>
I
relate
the
whole
of
the
circumstance
,
while
my

very
attentively
.
 
<EOS>
"

Ray
say
at
last
,
"
it
be
a
great
pity
,
old

<EOS>
the
Baron

no
other
person
than
Lucien

trust
agent

She

<EOS>
You

while

then

I
exclaim

my

without

"
 
<EOS>
"
to

CHAPTER
X
 
<EOS>
the
SECRET
of
the
CLYDE
defence
  
<EOS>
a
curious
episode
be
that
of
the
plan
of
the
Clyde
Defences
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
February
evening
.
<EOS>
Wet
,
tired
,
and
hungry
<EOS>
,
I
turn
the
long
grey
tour
car
into
the
yard
of
the
old
"
White
Hart
,
"
at
Salisbury
,
and
descend
with
eager
anticipation
of
a
big
fire
and
comfortable
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
My
mechanic
Bennett
and
<EOS>
I
have
be
on
the
road
since
soon
after
dawn
,
and
we
yet
have
many
mile
to
cover
.
<EOS>
two
month
ago
I
have
mount
the
car
at
the
garage
in
Wardour
Street
and
set
out
upon
a
long
and
weary
ten
-
thousand
-
mile
journey
in
England
,
not
for
pleasure
,
as
you
may
well
imagine
--
but
purely
upon
business
.
<EOS>
My
business
,
to
be
exact
,
be
reconnoitre
,
from
a
military
stand
-
point
,
all
the
road
and
by
-
road
lie
between
the
Tyne
and
the
Thames
as
well
as
certain
district
south
-
west
of
London
,
in
order
to
write
the
book
upon
similar
line
to
_
the
Invasion
of
1910
<EOS>
_
.
 
<EOS>
for
two
month
we
have
live
upon
the
road
.
<EOS>
sometimes
Ray
and
Vera
have
travel
with
me
.
<EOS>
when
Bennett
and
I
have
start
it
be
late
and
pleasant
autumn
.
<EOS>
now
it
be
bleak
,
black
winter
,
and
hardly
the
kind
of
weather
to
travel
twelve
or
fourteen
hour
daily
in
an
open
car
.
<EOS>
day
after
day
,
week
after
week
,
the
big
"
sixty
"
have
roar
along
,
plough
the
mud
of
those
ever
-
wind
road
of
England
until
we
have
lose
all
count
of
the
day
of
the
week
;
my
voluminous
note
-
book
be
gradually
be
fill
with
valuable
datum
,
and
the
nerve
of
both
of
us
be
become
so
strained
that
we
be
victim
of
insomnia
.
<EOS>
hence
at
night
,
when
we
could
not
sleep
,
we
travel
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
great
portfolio
in
the
back
of
the
car
I
carry
the
six
-
inch
ordnance
map
of
the
whole
of
the
east
of
England
divide
into
many
section
,
and
upon
these
I
be
carefully
mark
out
,
as
result
of
my
survey
,
the
weak
point
of
our
land
in
case
an
enemy
invade
our
shore
from
the
North
Sea
.
<EOS>
all
telegraph
,
telephone
,
and
cable
from
London
to
Germany
and
Holland
I
be
especially
note
,
for
would
not
the
enemy
's
emissary
,
before
they
attempt
to
land
,
seize
all
mean
of
communication
with
the
metropolis
?
<EOS>
besides
this
I
take
note
of
place
where
food
could
be
obtain
,
list
of
shop
,
and
collect
a
quantity
of
other
valuable
information
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
work
I
have
be
assist
by
half
a
dozen
of
the
high
officer
of
the
Intelligence
Department
of
the
War
Office
,
as
well
as
other
well
-
know
expert
--
careful
,
methodical
work
prior
to
write
my
forecast
of
what
must
happen
to
our
beloved
country
in
case
of
invasion
.
<EOS>
the
newspaper
have
refer
to
my
long
journey
of
inquiry
,
and
often
when
I
arrive
in
a
town
,
our
car
,
smother
in
mud
,
yet
its
powerful
engine
run
like
a
clock
,
be
the
object
of
public
curiosity
,
while
Bennett
,
with
true
chauffeur
-
like
imperturbability
,
sit
immovable
,
utterly
regardless
of
the
interest
we
create
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
gentleman
-
driver
,
and
the
good
man
at
the
wheel
I
ever
have
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
be
in
a
hurry
he
would
travel
nearly
a
mile
a
minute
over
an
open
road
,
sound
his
siren
drive
off
the
fly
-
wheel
,
and
scent
police
-
trap
,
with
the
happy
result
that
we
be
never
hold
up
for
exceed
the
limit
.
<EOS>
We
use
to
take
it
in
turn
to
drive
--
three
hour
at
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
on
that
particular
night
,
when
we
enter
Salisbury
from
Wincanton
Road
,
have
come
up
from
Exeter
,
it
have
be
rain
unceasingly
all
day
,
and
we
present
a
pretty
plight
in
our
yellow
fisherman
's
oilskin
--
which
we
have
buy
week
before
in
King
's
Lynn
as
the
only
mean
of
keep
dry
--
drip
wet
and
smother
to
our
very
eye
in
mud
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
hasty
wash
I
enter
the
coffee
-
room
,
and
find
that
I
be
the
sole
diner
save
a
short
,
funny
,
little
old
lady
in
black
bonnet
and
cape
,
and
a
young
,
rather
pretty
,
well
-
dress
girl
,
whom
I
take
to
be
her
daughter
,
seat
at
a
table
a
little
distance
away
.
 
<EOS>
both
glance
at
me
as
they
enter
,
and
I
see
that
ere
<EOS>
I
be
half
through
my
meal
their
interest
in
me
have
suddenly
increase
.
<EOS>
without
doubt
,
the
news
of
my
arrival
have
go
round
the
hotel
,
and
the
waiter
have
inform
the
pair
of
my
identity
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
then
eight
o'clock
,
and
I
have
arrange
with
Bennett
that
after
a
rest
,
we
would
push
forward
at
half
-
past
ten
by
Marlborough
,
as
far
as
Swindon
,
on
our
way
to
Birmingham
.
 
<EOS>
the
waiter
have
bring
me
a
couple
of
telegram
from
Ray
tell
me
good
news
of
another
inquiry
he
be
institute
,
and
have
finish
my
meal
I
be
seat
alone
by
the
smoking
-
room
fire
enjoy
a
cigarette
and
liqueur
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
have
almost
fall
asleep
when
the
waiter
return
,
say
:
 
<EOS>
"
excuse
me
,
sir
,
but
there
be
a
lady
outside
in
great
distress
.
<EOS>
She
want
to
speak
to
you
for
a
moment
,
and
ask
if
she
may
come
in
.
"
<EOS>
He
present
a
card
,
and
the
name
upon
it
be
"
Mrs.
Henry
Bingham
.
"
 
<EOS>
rather
surprised
,
I
nevertheless
consent
to
see
her
,
and
in
a
few
moment
the
door
reopen
and
the
young
of
the
two
lady
I
have
see
at
dinner
enter
.
 
<EOS>
She
bow
to
me
as
I
rise
,
and
<EOS>
then
,
evidently
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
,
she
say
:
 
"
I
must
apologise
for
disturb
you
,
only
<EOS>
--
only
I
think
perhaps
you
would
be
generous
enough
,
when
you
have
hear
of
our
difficulty
,
to
grant
my
mother
and
I
a
favour
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
I
can
be
of
any
assistance
to
you
,
I
shall
be
most
delighted
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
,
"
I
answer
,
as
her
big
grey
eye
meet
mine
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
she
say
,
look
me
straight
in
the
face
<EOS>
,
"
the
fact
be
that
our
car
have
break
down
--
something
wrong
with
the
clutch
,
our
man
say
--
and
we
can
not
get
any
further
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
We
be
on
our
way
to
Swindon
--
to
my
husband
,
who
have
meet
with
an
accident
and
be
in
the
hospital
,
but
--
but
,
unfortunately
,
there
be
no
train
to

night
.
<EOS>
Your
chauffeur
have
tell
our
man
that
you
be
just
leave
for
Swindon
,
and
my
mother
and
I
have
be
wonder
--
<EOS>
well
--
whether
we
may
encroach
upon
your
good
nature
and
beg
seat
in
your
car
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
be
quite
welcome
to
travel
with
me
,
of
course
,
"
<EOS>
I
reply
without
hesitation
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
fear
that
on
such
a
night
it
will
hardly
be
pleasant
to
travel
in
an
open
car
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
we
do
not
mind
that
a
bit
,
"
she
assure
me
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
lot
of
waterproof
and
thing
.
<EOS>
It
be
really
most
kind
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
telegram
at
four
o'clock
this
afternoon
that
my
husband
have
be
take
to
the
hospital
for
operation
,
and
naturally
I
be
most
anxious
to
be
at
his
side
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
naturally
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
regret
very
much
that
you
should
have
such
cause
for
distress
.
<EOS>
let
us
start
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
ready
in
ten
minute
.
"
 
<EOS>
while
she
go
back
to
her
mother
,
I
go
out
into
the
yard
where
the
head
-
light
of
my
big
"
sixty
"
be
gleam
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
two
lady
passenger
to
Swindon
,
Bennett

"
I
say
,
as
my
chauffeur
throw
away
his
cigarette
and
approach
me
.
<EOS>
"
what
kind
of
car
have
the
lady
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
twenty
-
four
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
garage
up
yonder
.
<EOS>
the
clutch
will
not
hold
,
it
seem
.
<EOS>
but
their
man
be
a
foreigner
,
and
do
not
speak
much
English
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
would
better
pack
our
luggage
tight
,
so
as
to
give
the
lady
room
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
.
do
so
.
<EOS>
and
let
's
get
on
the
road
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
sir
,
"
respond
the
man
as
he
enter
the
car
and
begin
pack
our
suit
-
case
together
while
almost
immediately
the
two
lady
emerge
,
the
eld
one
,
whose
voice
be
harsh
and
squeaky
,
and
who
be
,
I
notice
,
very
deformed
,
thank
me
profusely
.
 
<EOS>
We
stow
them
away
as
comfortably
as
possible
,
and
just
as
the
cathedral
chime
ring
out
half
-
past
ten
,
the
lady
give
part
injunction
to
their
chauffeur
,
and
we
draw
out
of
the
yard
.
 
<EOS>
I
apologise
for
the
dampness
and
discomfort
of
an
open
car
,
and
briefly
explain
my
long
journey
and
its
object
.
<EOS>
but
both
lady
--
the
name
of
the
queer
little
old
widow
I
understand
to
be
Sandford
--
only
laugh
,
and
reassure
me
that
they
be
all
right
.
 
<EOS>
that
night
I
drive
myself
.
<EOS>
with
the
exhaust
open
and
roar
,
and
the
siren
shrieking
,
we
speed
along
through
the
dark
,
rainy
night
up
by
old
Sarum
,
through
Netheravon
,
and
across
Overton
Heath
into
Marlborough
without
once
change
speed
or
speak
with
my
passenger
.
<EOS>
as
we
come
down
the
hill
from
Ogbourne
,
I
have
to
pull
up
suddenly
for
a
farmer
's
cart
,
and
turn
,
ask
the
pair
behind
how
they
be
fare
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
do
so
I
notice
that
both
of
them
seem
considerably
flurry
,
but
attribute
it
to
the
high
pace
we
have
be
travel
when
I
have
so
suddenly
pull
up
on
round
the
bend
.
 
<EOS>
three
-
quarter
of
an
hour
later
I
deposit
them
at
their
destination
,
the
"
Goddard
Arms
,
"
in
Old
Swindon
,
and
,
descending
,
receive
their
profuse
thank
,
the
eld
lady
give
me
her
card
with
an
address
in
Earl
's
Court
Road
,
Kensington
,
and
ask
me
to
call
upon
her
when
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
then
half
an
hour
past
midnight
,
but
Bennett
and
I
resolve
to
push
forward
as
far
as
Oxford
,
which
we
do
,
arrive
at
the
"
Mitre
"
about
half
-
past
one
,
utterly
fag
and
wear
out
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
be
bright
,
and
we
proceed
north
to
Birmingham
and
across
once
again
to
the
east
coast
,
where
the
bulk
of
my
work
lie
.
 
<EOS>
about
a
fortnight
go
by
.
<EOS>
with
the
assistance
of
two
well
-
know
staff
-
officer
I
have
be
reconnoitre
the
country
around
beccle
,
in
Suffolk
,
which
we
have
decide
upon
as
a
most
important
strategical
point
,
and
one
morning
I
find
myself
at
that
old
-
fashioned
hotel
"
the
Cups
,
"
at
Colchester
,
take
a
day
's
rest
.
<EOS>
the
two
officer
have
return
to
London
,
and
I
be
again
alone
.
 
<EOS>
out
in
the
garage
I
find
a
rather
smart
,
good
-
looking
man
in
navy
serge
chat
with
Bennett
and
admire
my
car
.
<EOS>
My
chauffeur
,
with
pardonable
pride
,
have
be
tell
him
of
our
long
journey
,
and
as
I
approach
,
the
stranger
inform
me
of
his
own
enthusiasm
as
a
motorist
.
 
<EOS>
"
curiously
enough
,
"
he
add
,
"
I
have
be
wish
to
meet
you
,
in
order
to
thank
you
for
your
kindness
to
my
mother
and
sister
the
other
night
at
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
My
name
be
Sandford
--
Charles
Sandford
--
and
if
I
be
not
mistaken
we
be
member
of
the
same
club
--
White
's
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
be

?
"
<EOS>
I
exclaim
.
"
<EOS>
then
I
be
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
lounge
together
for
half
an
hour
,
smoking
and
chatting
,
until
presently
he
say
:
 
"
I
live
out
at
Edwardstone
,
about
ten
mile
from
here
.
<EOS>
why
not
come
out
and
dine
with
me
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
My
place
be
not
very
extensive
,
but
it
be
cosy
enough
for
a
bachelor
.
<EOS>
I
would
feel
extremely
honoured
if
you
would
.
<EOS>
I
be
all
alone
.
<EOS>
do
come
.
"
 
<EOS>
Cosmopolitan
that
I
be
,
yet
I
be
not
prone
to
accept
the
invitation
of
stranger
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
this
man
be
not
altogether
a
stranger
,
for
be
he
not
a
member
of
my
own
club
?
<EOS>
truth
to
tell
<EOS>
,
I
have
become
bore
by
the
deadly
dullness
of
country
hotel
,
therefore
I
be
glad
enough
to
accept
his
proffer
hospitality
and
spend
a
pleasant
evening
.
 
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
send
a
wire
to
my
housekeeper
,
and
I
will
pilot
you
in
your
car
to
my
place
this
evening
.
<EOS>
We
will
start
at
seven
,
and
dine
at
eight
--
if
that
will
suit
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
so
it
be
arrange
.
 
<EOS>
Bennett
have
the
whole
of
the
day
to
go
through
the
car
and
do
one
or
two
necessary
repair
,
while
Sandford
and
myself
idle
about
the
town
.
<EOS>
My
companion
strike
me
as
an
exceedingly
pleasant
fellow
,
who
,
have
travel
very
extensively
,
now
prefer
a
quiet
existence
in
the
country
,
with
a
little
hunting
and
a
little
shooting
in
due
season
,
to
the
dinner
,
theatre
,
and
fevered
haste
of
London
life
.
 
<EOS>
the
evening
prove
a
very
dark
one
with
threaten
rain
as
we
turn
out
of
the
yard
of
"
the
Cups
,
"
Sandford
and
I
seat
behind
.
<EOS>
My
friend
direct
Bennett
from
time
to
time
,
and
soon
we
find
ourselves
out
on
the
Sudbury
road
.
<EOS>
We
pass
through
a
little
place
which
I
know
to
be
Heyland
,
and
then
turn
off
to
the
right
,
across
what
seem
to
be
a
wide
stretch
of
bleak
,
open
country
.
 
<EOS>
over
the
heath
we
go
,
<EOS>
our
head
-
light
glare
far
before
us
,
for
about
two
mile
when
my
friend
call
to
Bennett
:
 
<EOS>
"
turn
to
the
left
at
the
cross
-
road
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
a
few
moment
later
we
be
travel
rather
cautiously
up
a
rough
by
-
road
,
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
which
we
come
to
a
long
,
old
-
fashioned
house
--
a
farm
-
house
evidently
,
transform
into
a
residence
.
 
<EOS>
the
door
be
open
by
a
middle
-
aged
,
red
-
faced
man
-
servant
,
and
as
I
step
within
the
small
hall
hang
with
fox
'
mask
,
brush
,
and
other
trophy
,
my
friend
wish
me
a
hearty
welcome
to
his
home
.
 
<EOS>
the
dining
-
room
prove
to
be
an
old
-
fashioned
apartment
panel
from
floor
to
ceiling
.
<EOS>
the
table
,
set
for
two
,
bear
a
fine
old
silver
candelabra
,
a
quantity
of
antique
plate
,
and
,
adorn
with
flower
,
be
evidently
the
table
of
a
man
who
be
comfortably
off
.
 
<EOS>
We
throw
off
our
heavy
coat
and
make
ourselves
cosy
beside
the
fire
when
the
servant
,
whom
my
host
address
as
Henry
,
bring
in
the
soup
.
<EOS>
therefore
we
go
to
the
table
and
commence
.
 
<EOS>
the
meal
prove
a
well
-
cook
and
well
-
choose
one
,
and
I
congratulate
him
upon
his
cook
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
forty
,
and
for
twenty
year
I
be
constantly
on
the
move
,
"
he
remark
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
nowadays
I
be
glad
to
be
able
to
settle
down
in
England
.
"
 
<EOS>
a
moment
later
I
hear
the
sound
of
a
car
leave
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
that
my
car
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
rather
surprised
.
 
<EOS>
"
probably
your
man
be
take
it
round
to
the
back
in
order
to
put
it
under
cover
.
<EOS>
hark
!
<EOS>
it
have
start
to
rain
.
"
 
<EOS>
to
me
,
however
,
the
sound
,
grow
fainter
,
be
very
much
as
though
Bennett
have
drive
the
car
away
.
 
<EOS>
the
wine
which
Henry
serve
so
quietly
and
sedately
be
of
the
good
.
<EOS>
but
both
my
host
and
myself
drank
little
.
 
<EOS>
Sandford
be
tell
me
of
the
strange
romance
concern
his
sister
Ellen
and
young
Bingham
--
a
man
who
have
come
into
eight
thousand
a
year
from
his
uncle
,
and
only
a
few
day
later
have
meet
with
an
accident
in
Swindon
,
have
be
knock
down
by
a
train
at
a
level
-
crossing
.
 
<EOS>
presently
,
after
dessert
,
our
conversation
run
upon
port
and
their
vintage
,
when
suddenly
my
host
remark
:
 
"
I
do
not
know
whether
you
be
a
connoisseur
of
brandy
,
but
I
happen
to
have
a
couple
of
rather
rare
vintage
.
<EOS>
let
's
try
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
confess
I
know
<EOS>
but
little
about
brandy
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
will
teach
you
how
to
test
them
in
future
,
"
he
laugh
,
add
,
"
Henry
,
bring
up
those
three
old
cognacs
,
a
bottle
of
ordinary
brandy
,
and
some
liqueur
-
glass
.
"
 
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
a
dozen
little
glass
make
their
appearance
on
a
tray
,
together
with
four
bottle
of
brandy
,
three
unlabelled
,
while
the
fourth
bore
the
label
of
a
well
-
know
brand
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
generally
know
,
I
think
,
that
one
can
not
test
brandy
with
any
degree
of
accuracy
by
the
palate
,
"
he
say
,
remove
his
cigar
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
aware
of
that
,
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
will
show
you
,
"
he
go
on
,
and
take
four
glass
in
a
row
he
pour
a
little
spirit
out
of
each
of
the
bottle
into
the
bottom
of
the
glass
.
<EOS>
this
done
,
he
twist
each
glass
round
in
order
to
wet
the
inside
with
the
spirit
,
and
the
surplus
he
empty
into
his
finger
-
bowl
.
<EOS>
then
,
hand
me
two
,
he
say
:
"
just
hold
one
in
each
hand
till
they
be
warm
.
<EOS>
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
take
the
remain
two
he
hold
one
in
the
hollow
of
each
hand
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
couple
or
three
minute
we
hold
them
thus
while
he
chat
about
the
various
vintage
.
<EOS>
then
we
place
them
in
a
row
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
he
say
,
"
take
up
each
one
separately
and
smell
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
do
so
,
and
find
a
most
pleasant
perfume
--
each
,
however
,
quite
separate
and
distinct
,
as
different
as
eau
-
de
-
Cologne
be
from
lavender
water
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
,
"
he
say
,
after
sniff
at
one
glass
,
"
be
1815
-
-Waterloo
year
--
a
magnificent
vintage
.
<EOS>
and
this
,
"
he
go
on
,
hand
me
the
second
glass
,
"
be
1829
-
-very
excellent
,
but
quite
a
distinct
perfume
,
you
notice
.
<EOS>
the
third
be
1864
-
-also
good
.
<EOS>
of
the
1815
I
very
fortunately
have
two
bottle
.
<EOS>
Bellamy
,
in
Pall
Mall
,
have
three
bottle
,
and
there
be
perhaps
four
bottle
in
all
Paris
.
<EOS>
that
be
all
that
be
leave
of
it
.
<EOS>
the
fourth
--
smell
it
--
be
the
ordinary
brandy
of
commerce
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
do
so
,
but
the
odour
be
nauseate
after
the
sweet
and
distinct
perfume
of
the
other
three
.
 
<EOS>
"
just
try
the
1815
,
"
he
urge
,
carefully
pour
out
about
a
third
of
a
glass
of
the
precious
pale
gold
liquid
and
hand
it
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
sip
it
,
find
it
exceedingly
pleasant
to
the
palate
.
<EOS>
so
old
be
it
that
it
seem
to
have
lose
all
its
strength
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
really
delicious
liqueur
--
the
liqueur
of
a
gourmet
,
and
assuredly
a
fitting
conclusion
to
that
excellent
repast
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
will
have
the
'
64
,
"
he
say
,
pour
out
a
glass
and
swallow
it
with
all
the
gusto
of
a
man
whose
chief
delight
be
the
satisfaction
of
his
stomach
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
a
cigarette
from
the
big
silver
box
he
hand
me
,
and
I
stretch
out
my
hand
for
the
match
....
<EOS>
beyond
that
,
curiously
enough
,
I
recollect
nothing
else
.
 
<EOS>
but
stay
!
<EOS>
yes
,
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
see
,
as
though
rise
from
out
a
hazy
grey
mist
,
a
woman
's
face
--
the
countenance
of
a
very
pretty
girl
,
about
eighteen
,
with
big
blue
wide
-
open
eye
and
very
fair
silky
hair
--
a
girl
,
whose
eye
bear
in
them
a
hideous
look
of
inexpressible
horror
.
 
<EOS>
next
instant
the
blackness
of
unconsciousness
fall
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
recover
I
be
amazed
to
find
myself
in
bed
,
with
the
yellow
wintry
sunlight
stream
into
the
low
,
old
-
fashioned
room
.
<EOS>
for
some
time
--
how
long
I
know
not
--
I
lie
there
stare
at
the
diamond
-
pan
window
straight
before
me
,
vaguely
wonder
what
have
occur
.
 
<EOS>
a
sound
at
last
strike
the
right
chord
of
my
memory
--
the
sound
of
my
host
's
voice
exclaim
cheerily
:
 
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
feel
,
old
chap
?
<EOS>
well
,
I
hope
,
after
your
long
sleep
.
<EOS>
do
you
know
it
be
nearly
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
two
o'clock
!
 
<EOS>
after
a
struggle
I
succeed
in
sit
up
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
occur
?
<EOS>
"
I
manage
to
gasp
.
<EOS>
"
I
--
I
do
not
exactly
remember
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
nothing
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
declare
my
friend
,
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
bit
tired
last
night
,
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
so
I
think
I
would
not
disturb
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
where
be
Bennett
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
downstairs
with
the
car
,
wait
till
you
feel
quite
right
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
then
realise
for
the
first
time
that
I
be
still
dress
.
<EOS>
only
my
boot
and
collar
and
tie
have
be
remove
.
 
<EOS>
much
puzzled
,
and
wonder
whether
it
be
actually
possible
that
I
have
take
too
much
wine
,
I
rise
to
my
foot
and
slowly
assume
my
boot
.
 
<EOS>
be
the
man
stand
before
me
a
friend
,
or
be
he
an
enemy
?
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
most
distinctly
sample
the
brandy
,
but
beyond
that
--
absolutely
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
at
my
host
's
order
Henry
bring
me
up
a
refreshing
cup
of
tea
and
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
,
during
which
Sandford
declare
that
"
such
little
annoying
incident
occur
in
the
life
of
every
man
,
"
I
descend
and
find
Bennett
wait
with
the
car
before
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
grasp
my
host
's
hand
in
farewell
he
whisper
confidentially
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
's
say
nothing
about
it
in
future
.
<EOS>
I
will
call
and
see
you
in
town
in
a
week
or
two
--
if
I
may
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
mechanically
I
declare
that
I
should
be
delighted
,
and
mount
into
the
car
we
glide
down
the
drive
to
the
road
.
 
<EOS>
My
brain
be
awhirl
,
and
I
be
in
no
mood
to
talk
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
sit
with
the
frosty
air
blow
upon
my
fevered
brow
as
we
travel
back
to
Colchester
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
you
intend
stay
the
night
,
sir
,
"
Bennett
venture
to
remark
just
before
we
enter
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
,
Bennett
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
you
send
word
to
me
soon
after
we
arrive
,
tell
me
to
return
at
noon
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
so
I
go
back
to
'
<EOS>
the
Cups
,
'
and
spend
all
this
morning
on
the
engine
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
who
give
you
that
message
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Sandford
's
man
,
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
sit
in
silence
.
<EOS>
what
could
it
mean
?
<EOS>
what
mystery
be
there
?
 
<EOS>
as
an
abstemious
man
I
feel
quite
convinced
that
I
have
not
take
too
much
wine
.
<EOS>
a
single
liqueur
-
glass
of
brandy
certainly
could
never
have
produce
such
an
effect
upon
me
.
<EOS>
and
strangely
enough
that
girl
's
face
,
so
shadowy
,
so
sweet
,
and
yet
so
distorted
by
horror
,
be
ever
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
three
week
after
the
curious
incident
,
have
conclude
my
survey
,
I
find
myself
back
in
Guilford
Street
,
my
journey
at
last
end
.
<EOS>
pleasant
,
indeed
,
it
be
to
sit
again
at
one
's
own
fireside
after
those
wet
,
never
-
end
muddy
road
upon
which
I
have
live
for
so
long
,
and
very
soon
I
settle
down
to
arrange
the
mass
of
material
I
have
collect
and
write
my
book
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
day
after
my
return
,
in
order
to
redeem
my
promise
and
to
learn
more
of
Charles
Sandford
,
I
call
at
the
address
of
the
queer
old
hump
-
back
widow
in
Earl
's
Court
Road
.
 
<EOS>
to
my
surprise
,
I
find
the
house
in
question
empty
,
with
every
evidence
of
its
have
be
to
let
for
a
year
or
more
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
mistake
in
the
number
;
it
be
print
upon
her
card
.
<EOS>
this
discovery
cause
me
increase
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
what
do
it
all
mean
?
 
<EOS>
through
many
week
I
sit
in
my
room
in
Bloomsbury
constantly
at
work
upon
my
book
.
<EOS>
the
technicality
be
many
and
the
difficulty
not
a
few
.
<EOS>
one
of
the
latter
--
and
perhaps
the
chief
one
--
be
to
so
disguise
the
real
vulnerable
point
of
our
country
which
I
have
discover
on
my
tour
with
military
expert
as
to
mislead
the
Germans
,
who
may
seek
to
make
use
of
the
information
I
convey
.
<EOS>
the
book
,
to
be
of
value
,
have
,
I
recognise
,
to
be
correct
in
detail
,
yet
at
the
same
time
it
must
suppress
all
fact
that
may
be
of
use
to
a
foreign
Power
.
 
<EOS>
the
incident
near
Colchester
have
nearly
pass
from
my
mind
,
when
one
night
in
February
,
1909
,
I
chance
to
be
have
supper
with
Ray
Raymond
and
Vera
at
the
"
Carlton
,
"
when
at
the
table
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
big
room
sit
a
smart
,
dark
-
haired
young
man
with
a
pretty
girl
in
turquoise
-
blue
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
look
across
,
our
eye
meet
.
<EOS>
in
an
instant
I
recollect
that
I
have
see
that
countenance
somewhere
before
.
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
It
be
actually
the
face
of
that
nightmare
of
mine
after
sample
Sandford
's
old
cognac
!
<EOS>
I
sit
there
stare
at
her
,
like
a
man
in
a
dream
.
<EOS>
the
countenance
be
the
sweetest
and
most
perfect
I
have
ever
gaze
upon
.
<EOS>
yet
why
have
I
see
it
in
my
unconsciousness
?
 
<EOS>
I
notice
that
she
start
.
<EOS>
then
,
turn
her
head
,
she
lean
over
and
whisper
something
to
her
companion
.
<EOS>
next
moment
,
pull
her
cloak
about
her
shoulder
,
she
rise
,
and
they
both
leave
hurriedly
.
 
<EOS>
what
could
her
fear
imply
?
<EOS>
why
be
she
in
such
terror
of
me
?
<EOS>
that
look
of
horror
which
I
have
see
on
that
memorable
night
be
again
there
--
yet
only
for
one
single
second
.
 
<EOS>
My
impulse
be
to
rise
and
dash
after
the
pair
.
<EOS>
yet
,
not
be
acquaint
with
her
,
I
should
only
,
by
so
do
,
make
a
fool
of
myself
and
also
annoy
my
lady
friend
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
for
many
day
and
many
week
the
remembrance
of
that
sweet
and
dainty
figure
ever
haunt
me
.
<EOS>
I
take
a
holiday
,
spend
great
part
of
the
time
on
a
friend
's
yacht
in
the
norwegian
fjord
.
<EOS>
yet
I
could
not
get
away
from
that
face
and
the
curious
mystery
attach
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
on
my
return
home
,
I
be
next
day
ring
up
on
the
telephone
by
my
friend
Major
Carmichael
,
of
the
Intelligence
Department
of
the
War
Office
,
who
have
be
one
of
my
assistant
in
prepare
the
forthcoming
book
.
<EOS>
at
his
urgent
request
I
go
round
to
see
him
in
Whitehall
,
and
on
be
usher
into
his
office
,
I
be
introduce
to
a
tall
,
dark
-
bearded
man
,
whose
name
I
understand
to
be
Shayler
.
 
<EOS>
"
My

exclaim
the
Major
,
"

me
for

I

still
here

be
my
reply

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
but
you
will
recollect
my
warning
long
ago
,
when
you
be
reconnoitre
.
<EOS>
do
you
ever
allow
them
to
pass
out
of
your
hand

"
never

them
in
my

the
key
of
which

always
on
my
chain

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
what
do
you
think
of
these
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
walk
to
a
side
table
where
lie
a
pile
of
twenty
or
thirty
glass
photographic
negative
.
<EOS>
and
take
up
one
of
them
,
he
hand
it
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
photograph
of
one
of
my
own
map

<EOS>
the
plan
be
the
section
of
country
in
the
vicinity
of
Glasgow

<EOS>
upon
it
I
see
note
in
my
own
handwriting
,
the
tracing
of
the
telegraph
wire
with
the
communication
of
each
wire
,
and
dozen
of
other
fact
of
supreme
importance
to
the
invader

<EOS>
"
great
heavens

<EOS>
"
I
gasp
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
where
do
you
get
that
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Shayler
will
tell
you
,
my

fellow

"
answer
the
Major
.
<EOS>
"
It
seem
that
you
have
be
guilty
of
some
sad
indiscretion
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
attach
to
the
Special
Department
at
New
Scotland
Yard

explain
the
dark
-
bearded
man
.
<EOS>
"
two
month
ago
a
member
of
the
secret
service
in
the
employ
of
our
Foreign
Office
make
a
report
from
Berlin
that
a
young
girl
,
name
Gertie
Drew
,
live
in
a
Bloomsbury
boarding
-
house
,
have
approach
the
german
military
attache
offering
,
for
three
thousand
pound
,
to
supply
him
with
photograph
of
a
number
of
confidential
plan
of
our
eastern
county
and
of
the
Clyde
defence
.
<EOS>
the
attache
have
report
to
the
War
Office
in
Berlin
,
hence
the
knowledge
obtain
by
the
british
secret
agent
.
<EOS>
the
matter
be
at
once
place
in
my
hand
,
and
since
that
time
I
have
keep
careful
observation
upon
the
girl
--
who
have
be
a
photographer
's
assistant
--
and
those
in
association
with
her
.
<EOS>
the
result
be
that
I
have
fortunately
manage
to
obtain
possession
of
these
negative
of
your
annotate
plan

how
?
<EOS>
"
I
demand
.
 
<EOS>
"
by
make

bold
move

be
the
detective
's
reply
.
<EOS>
"
the
Germans
be
already
bargain
for
these
negative
when
I
become
convinced
that
the
girl
be
only
the
tool
of
a
man
who
have
also
be
a
photographer
,
and
who
have
lead
a
very
adventurous
life
--
an
American
live
away
in
the
country
,
near
Colchester
,
under
the
name
of
Charles
Sandford
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
Sandford
!

I
gasp
,
stare
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
the

like
?
"
 
<EOS>

here
be
her
portrait

be
the

<EOS>
yes

It
be
the
sweet
face
of
my
nightmare
!
 
<EOS>
"
what
have
you
discover
regard
Sandford
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
presently
,
when
I
have
relate
to
the
two
man
the
story
of
the
meeting
at
Salisbury
and
also
my
night
's
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
"
though
bear
in
America
and
adopt
an
english
name
,
his
father
be
german
,
and
we
strongly
suspect
him
of
have
,
on
several
occasion
,
sell
information
to
Germany
.
<EOS>
yesterday
,
feel
quite
certain
of
my
ground
,
I
go
down
into
Essex
with
a
search
warrant
and
make
an
examination
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Upstairs
I
find
a
very
complete
photographic
plant
,
and
conceal
beneath
the
floor
-
board
in
the
dining
-
room
<EOS>
be
a
box
contain
these
negative
,
many
of
them
be
of
your
map
of
the
Clyde
defence
,
which
they
be
just
about
to
dispose
of
.
<EOS>
the
man
have
get
wind
that
we
be
keep
observation
upon
him
,
and
have
already
flee
.
<EOS>
the
gang
consist
of
an
old
hump
-
back
woman
,
who
pose
as
his
mother
,
a
young
woman
,
who
he
say
be
his
marry
sister
,
but
who
be
really
the
wife
of
his
man
-
servant
,
and
the
girl
Drew
,
who
be
his
photographic
assistant
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
where
be
the
girl
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
do
not
intend
to
arrest
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
if
you
see
her
perhaps
you
may
induce
her
to
tell
you
the
truth
.
<EOS>
the
plot
to
photograph
those
plan
while
you
be
insensible
be
certainly
a
cleverly
contrive
one
,
and
it
be
equally
certain
that
the
two
woman
you
meet
in
Salisbury
only
travel
with
you
in
order
to
be
convince
that
you
really
carry
the
precious
map
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
admit
,
utterly
amazed
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
most
cleverly
trap
,
but
it
be
most
fortunate
that
we
be
forewarn
,
and
that
our
zealous
friend
across
the
water
have
be
prevent
from
purchase
the
detailed
exposure
of
our
most
vulnerable
point
.
"
 
<EOS>
that
afternoon
,
Gertie
Drew
,
the
neat
-
waiste
girl
with
the
fair
face
,
walk
timidly
into
my
room
,
and
together
we
sit
for
fully
an
hour
,
during
which
time
she
explain
how
the
man
Sandford
have
abstract
the
portfolio
from
my
car
and
substitute
an
almost
exact
replica
,
prior
to
send
Bennett
back
to
Colchester
,
and
how
at
the
moment
of
my
unconsciousness
--
as
he
be
search
me
for
my
key
--
she
have
enter
the
dining
-
room
when
I
have
open
my
eye
,
and
stare
at
her
have
accuse
her
of
poison
me
.
<EOS>
She
know
she
have
be
recognise
,
and
that
have
cause
her
alarm
in
the
"
Carlton
.
"
 
<EOS>
that
Sandford
have
manage
to
replace
the
portfolio
in
the
car
and
abstract
the
replica
next
day
be
explain
,
and
that
he
have
hold
the
girl
completely
in
his
power
be
equally
apparent
.
<EOS>
therefore
,
I
have
since
obtain
for
her

to
adopt
a

of

<EOS>
about
six
month
after
my
curious
motoring
adventure
in
Essex
<EOS>
I

to
the

<EOS>
eagerly
we

the
formal

from
the

date
from

state
that

be
about

<EOS>
He
would
be
at
the

Hotel
in
four
day

time
,
and
he
make
an
appointment
for
me
to
call
.
 
<EOS>
"

"
cry
Ray
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
ask
very
little
wage
.
<EOS>
Germans

a
stingy
lot

<EOS>
the
Baron
have
be
act
as
a
secret
agent
of
the
Kaiser
in
Paris
,
but
have
to
fly
on
account
of
the
recent
Ullmo
affair
at
Toulon
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
very
clever
spy
--
about
as
clever
,
indeed
,
as
Hartmann
himself
.
<EOS>
why
he
be
come
to
England
be
not
quite
clear
.
<EOS>
but
we
must
find
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
for
the
next
four
day
I
wait
in
great
anxiety
,
and
when
,
at
the
appoint
hour
,
I
present
myself
at
the
"
Ritz
"
and
be
show
into
the
private
salon
,
the
middle
-
aged
,
fair
-
haired
,
rather
elegant
man
eye
me
up
and
down
swiftly
as
I
stand
before
him
with
great
deference
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
about
to
play
a
dangerous
game
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
number
of
question
,
and
an
examination
of
my
credential
,
all
of
which
,
I
may
as
well
admit
,
have
be
prepare
by
Ray
and
Vera
,
he
engage
me
,
and
that
same
evening
I
enter
upon
my
duty
,
greatly
to
the
satisfaction
of
Vera
and
her
lover
.
 
<EOS>
fortunately
I
be
not
know
at
the
"
Ritz
,
"
and
be
therefore
able
for
the
first
week
or
so
to
do
my
valeting
,
brush
my
master
's
clothe
,
polish
his
boot
,
get
out
his
dress
-
suit
,
and
other
such
duty
,
undisturbed
,
my
eye
,
however
,
always
open
to
get
a
glimpse
of
any
paper
that
may
be
leave
in
the
pocket
or
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
twice
he
drive
to
Pont
Street
and
dine
with
Hartmann
.
<EOS>
the
pair
be
in
frequent
consultation
,
it
seem
,
for
one
afternoon
the
chief
of
the
german
spy
in
England
call
,
and
be
closet
closely
with
my
master
for
fully
two
hour
.
 
<EOS>
I
stand
outside
the
door
,
but
unfortunately
the
door
of
the
"
Ritz
"
be
so
constructed
that
nothing
can
be
hear
in
the
corridor
.
<EOS>
all
I
know
be
that
,
on
be
call
in
to
give
a
message
over
the
telephone
,
I
see
lie
on
the
table
between
them
several
english
six
-
inch
ordnance
map
.
 
<EOS>
no
master
could
have
be
more
generous
than
the
Baron
.
<EOS>
He
be
tall
,
rather
dandified
,
and
seem
a
great
favourite
with
the
lady
.
<EOS>
Hartmann
have
introduce
him
to
certain
well
-
know
member
of
the
german
colony
in
London
,
and
he
pass
as
the
possessor
of
a
big
estate
near
Cochem
,
on
the
Moselle
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
one
day
while
I
be
brush
his
coat
that
he
prefer
life
in
England
to
Germany
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
make
no
mention
of
his
residence
in
France
and
how
he
have
ingeniously
induce
a
french
naval
officer
to
become
a
traitor
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
"
Ritz
"
we
,
later
on
,
remove
into
expensive
quarter
at
"
Claridge
's
,
"
and
here
my
master
receive
frequent
visit
from
a
shabby
,
thin
-
faced
,
shrivel
-
up
old
foreigner
,
whom
I
take
to
be
a
dutchman
,
his
name
be
Mr.
Van
Nierop
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
he
call
the
Baron
and
he
hold
close
consultation
,
sometimes
for
hour
.
<EOS>
We
travel
to
Eastbourne
,
Bournemouth
,
Birmingham
,
Edinburgh
,
Glasgow
,
and
other
city
,
yet
ever
and
anon
the
shabby
old
Dutchman
seem
to
turn
up
at
odd
time
and
place
,
as
though
spring
from
nowhere
.
 
<EOS>
when
absent
from
London
,
the
Baron
frequently
send
telegraphic
message
in
cipher
to
a
register
address
in
London
.
<EOS>
be
these
,
I
wonder
,
intend
for
Hartmann
or
for
the
mysterious
Van
Nierop
?
 
<EOS>
the
old
fellow
seem
to
haunt
us
everywhere
,
dog
our
footstep
continually
,
and
appear
in
all
sort
of
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
place
with
his
long
,
greasy
overcoat
,
shabby
hat
,
and
shuffling
gait
,
by
which
many
mistake
him
for
a
Hebrew
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
more
closely
I
watch
my
aristocratic
master
,
the
more
convinced
I
become
that
Van
Nierop
<EOS>
and
he
be
act
in
collusion
.
<EOS>
but
of
what
be
in
progress
I
could
obtain
no
inkling
.
 
<EOS>
frequently
we
move
quickly
from
one
place
to
another
,
as
though
my
master
fear
pursuit
,
then
we
go
suddenly
to
Aix
,
Vichy
,
and
Carlsbad
,
and
remain
away
for
some
week
.
<EOS>
early
in
the
autumn
we
be
back
again
at
a
suite
of
well
-
furnish
chamber
in
Clarges
Street
,
off
piccadilly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
expect
,
Dickson
,
that
we
shall
be
in
London
some
month
,
"
the
Baron
have
say
to
me
on
the
second
morning
after
we
have
instal
ourselves
with
our
luggage
.
<EOS>
the
place
belong
to
a
wealthy
young
peer
of
race
proclivity
,
and
be
replete
with
every
comfort
.
<EOS>
all
have
be
leave
just
as
it
be
,
even
to
an
open
box
of
cigar
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
have
go
on
a
trip
round
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
third
day
--
a
very
wet
and
dismal
one
,
I
recollect
--
the
old
Dutchman
arrive
.
<EOS>
the
Baron
be
out
,
therefore
he
wait
--
wait
in
patience
for
six
long
hour
for
his
return
.
<EOS>
when
my
master
re
-
enter
,
the
pair
sit
together
for
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
then
suddenly
the
Baron
shout
to
me
,
"

<EOS>

my
suit

<EOS>
Put

<EOS>
and
I

<EOS>
You
will
stay
here
and
mind
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
,
"
I
reply
,
and
begin
briskly
to
execute
his
order
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
shabby
old
fellow
have
go
,
the
Baron
call
me
into
the
sitting
-
room
and
give
me
two
cipher
telegram
,
one

the
yellow
form

<EOS>
"
these
,
Dickson
,
I
shall

for
I
may
want

.
<EOS>
send
them
the

<EOS>
I
will
tell

<EOS>
It
be
half

past

<EOS>
I

address
.
<EOS>
here
be
money
to
get
along
with
.
<EOS>
wait
here
until
my
return
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorely
disappointed
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
he
be
a
spy
and
be
in
England
for
some
fix
purpose
.
<EOS>
but
what
it
be
I
could
not
discover
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
,
"
he
add
,
as
though
it
be
an
afterthought
,
"
if
any
one
should
by
chance
inquire
about
Mr.
Van
Nierop
--
whether
you
know
him
,
or
if
he
have
be
here
--
remember
that
you
know
nothing
--
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
understand
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
sir
,
"
be
my
response
.
 
<EOS>
five
minute
later
,
refuse
to
allow
me
to
accompany
him
to
the
station
,
he
drive
away
into
Piccadilly
with
his
luggage
upon
a
hansom
,
and
thus
be
I
leave
alone
for
an
indefinite
period
.
 
<EOS>
that
evening
I
go
round
to
Bruton
Street
,
where
I
see
Ray
,
and
describe
what
have
occur
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
stare
into
the
fire
in
silence
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
he
answer
at
last
,
"
if
what
I
surmise
be
true
,
Jack
,
the
Baron
ought
to
be
back
here
in
about
a
week
.
<EOS>
continue
to
keep
both
eye
and
ear
open
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
deep
game
be
play
,
I
be
certain
.
<EOS>
He
be
with
Hartmann
very
often
.
<EOS>
recollect
what
I
tell
you
about
the
clever
manner
in
which
the
Baron
conduct
the
affair
at
Toulon
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
be
entirely
successful
have
not
a
woman
give
ullmo
away
.
<EOS>
see
me
as
little
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
You
never
know
who
may
be
watch
you
during
the
Baron
's
absence
.
"
 
<EOS>
on
the
next
evening
I
go
out
for
a
stroll
towards
Piccadilly
Circus
and
accidentally
meet
a
man
I
know
,
a
German
name
Karl
Stieber
,
a
man
of
about
thirty
,
who
be
valet
to
a
young
gentleman
who
live
in
the
flat
beneath
us
.
 
<EOS>
together
we
descend
to
that
noisy
cafe
beneath
the
Hotel
de
l'Europe
in
Leicester
Square
,
where
we
meet
four
other
friend
of
Karl
's
,
servant
like
himself
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
sit
together
,
he
tell
me
that
his
brother
be
head
-
waiter
at
a
little
french
restaurant
in
Dean
Street
,
Soho
,
call
"
La
Belle
Nicoise
,
"
a
place
where
one
could
obtain
real
provencal
dish
.
<EOS>
then
,
I
on
my
part
,
tell
him
of
my
own
position
and
my
travel
with
the
Baron
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
ascend
into
Leicester
Square
again
we
find
the
pavement
congest
,
for
Daly
's
,
the
Empire
,
and
the
Alhambra
have
just
disgorge
their
throng
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
walk
with
me
he
turn
,
and
suddenly
ask
:
 
"
since
you
have
be
in
London
have
old
Van
Nierop
visit
the
Baron
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
start
in
quick
surprise
,
but
in
an
instant
recollect
my
master
's
injunction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Van
Nierop
!
<EOS>
"
I
echo
.
<EOS>
"
whom
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
but
he
only
laugh
knowingly
,
exclaim
:
 
"
<EOS>
all
right
.
<EOS>
You
will
deny
all
knowledge
of
him
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
Dickson
,
take
the
advice
of
one
who
know
,
and
be
ever
watchful
.
<EOS>
take
care
of
your
own
self
.
<EOS>
good
night
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
my
friend
,
who
seem
to
possess
some
secret
knowledge
,
vanish
in
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
once
or
twice
he
ascend
and
call
upon
me
,
and
we
sometimes
use
to
spend
our
evening
together
in
that
illicit
little
gaming
-
room
behind
a
shop
in
Old
Compton
Street
,
a
place
much
frequent
by
foreign
servant
.
 
<EOS>
I
notice
,
however
,
though
he
be
very
inquisitive
regard
the
Baron
and
his
movement
,
he
would
never
give
me
any
reason
.
<EOS>
He
sometimes
warn
me
mysteriously
that
I
be
in
danger
.
<EOS>
but
to
me
his
word
appear
absurd
.
 
<EOS>
one
evening
,
in
the
third
week
of
December
,
he
and
I
be
in
the
Baron
's
room
chatting
,
when
a
ring
come
at
the
door
,
and
I
find
the
Baron
himself
,
look
very
tired
and
fag
.
<EOS>
He
almost
stagger
into
his
sitting
-
room
,
brush
past
Karl
on
his
way
.
<EOS>
He
be
dress
in
different
clothe
,
and
I
scarcely
recognise
him
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
be
that
,
Dickson
?
"
<EOS>
he
demand
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
tell
you
I
forbid
visitor
here
!
<EOS>
send
him
away
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
talk
to
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
obey
,
and
when
he
hear
the
door
close
the
Baron
,
who
I
notice
be
travel
-
wear
and
dirty
,
with
a
soiled
collar
and
many
day
'
growth
of
beard
,
<EOS>
say
:
 
"
do
not
have
anybody
here
--
not
even
your
good
friend
,
Dickson
.
<EOS>
You
would
admit
no
stranger
here
if
you
know
the
truth
,
"
he
add
,
with
a
meaning
look
.
"
<EOS>
fortunately
,
perhaps
you
do
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
,
after
he
have
gulp
down
the
cognac
I
have
bring
at
his
order
,
he
go
on
:
 
"
now
,
listen
.
<EOS>
in
a
little
more
than
a
week
it
will
be
New

<EOS>
on
that
day
there
will
arrive
for
me
a

<EOS>
You
will
open
all
my
letter
on
that
morning
,
and
find
it

<EOS>
either
it
will
be
perfectly
plain
and
bear
the
word
'
a
Happy

<EOS>
I
reply
in
the
affirmative
,
when
,
to
my
surprise
he
rise
,
and
instead
of
enter
his
bedroom
to
wash
,
he
simply
swallow
a
second
glass
of
brandy
,
sigh
,
and
depart
,
say
:
 
<EOS>
"

"
 
<EOS>
twice
<EOS>
my
friend
Stieber
call
in
the
day
that
follow
,
but
I
flatter
myself
that
from
me
he
learn
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
morning
of
New
Year
's
day
five
letter
be
push
through
the
box
.
<EOS>
eagerly
I
tear
them
open
.
<EOS>
the
last
,
bear
a
dutch
stamp
,
with
the
postmark
of
Utrecht
,
contain
the

with
the
compliment
of
the
Season
.
"
 
<EOS>
half
an
hour
later
,
have
burn
the
card
accord
to
my
instruction
,
I
despatch
the
mysterious
message
to
Manchester
.
 
<EOS>
that
evening
,
about
ten
o'clock
,
Stieber
call
for
me
to
go
for
a
stroll
and
drink
a
New
Year
health
.
<EOS>
but
as
we
turn
from
Clarges
Street
into
piccadilly
I
could
have
swear
that
a
man
we
pass
in
the
darkness
be
old
Van
Nierop
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
remark
,
however
,
because
I
do
not
wish
to
draw
my
companion
's
attention
to
the
shuffling
old
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
have
the
telegram
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
,
bring
him
to
London
?
 
<EOS>
ten
minute
later
,
in
the
Cafe
Monico
,
my
friend
Karl
lift
his
glass
to
me
,
say
:
 
"
<EOS>
well
,
a
Happy
New
Year
,
my
dear
friend
.
<EOS>
take
my
advice
,
and
do
not
trust
your
Baron
too
implicitly
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
<EOS>
"
You
always
speak
in
enigmas
!
"
 
<EOS>
but
he
laugh
,
and
would
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
dawn
.
<EOS>
Grey
and
muddy
,
it
be
render
more
dismal
by
my
loneliness
.
<EOS>
I
idle
away
the
morning
,
anxious
to
be
travel
again
,
but
at
noon
there
be
a
caller
,
a
thin
,
pale
-
faced
girl
of
fifteen
or
so
,
poorly
dressed
and
evidently
of
the
working
-
class
.
 
<EOS>
when
,
in
response
to
her
question
,
I
have
tell
her
my
name
,
she
say
:
 
"
I
have
be
send
by
the
Baron
to
tell
you
he
wish
to
see
you
very
particularly
to
-
night
at
nine
o'clock
,
at
this
address
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
hand
me
an
envelope
with
an
address
upon
it
,
and
then
go
down
the
stair
.
 
<EOS>
the
address
I
read
be
:
"
4A
Bishop
's
Lane
,
Chiswick
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
mysterious
appointment
puzzle
me
,
but
after
spend
a
very
cheerless
day
,
I
hail
a
taxi
-
cab
at
eight
o'clock
and
set
forth
for
Chiswick
,
a
district
to
which
I
have
never
before
be
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
we
find
ourselves
outside
an
old
-
fashioned
church
,
and
on
inquiry
I
be
tell
by
a
boy
that
Bishop
's
Lane
be
at
the
end
of
a
footpath
which
lead
through
the
churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
dismiss
the
taxi
,
and
after
some
search
,
at
length
find
No
.
4A
,
an
old
-
fashioned
house
stand
alone
in
the
darkness
amid
a
large
garden
surround
by
high
,
bare
tree
--
a
house
build
in
the
long
ago
day
before
Chiswick
become
a
London
suburb
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
walk
up
the
path
the
door
be
open
,
and
I
find
the
old
man
Van
Nierop
stand
behind
it
.
 
<EOS>
without
a
word
he
usher
me
into
a
back
room
,
which
,
to
my
surprise
,
be
carpetless
and
barely
furnish
.
<EOS>
then
he
say
,
in
that
strange
croak
voice
of
his
:
 
<EOS>
"
Your
master
will
be
here
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
He
be
delay
.
<EOS>
have
a
cigarette
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
take
one
from
the
packet
he
offer
,
and
still
puzzle
,
light
it
and
sit
down
to
await
the
Baron
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
have
shuffle
out
,
and
I
be
leave
alone
,
when
of
a
sudden
a
curious
drowsiness
overcome
me
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
there
must
have
be
a
narcotic
in
the
tobacco
,
for
I
undoubtedly
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
awake
I
find
,
to
my
amazement
,
that
I
could
not
use
my
arm
.
<EOS>
I
be
still
seat
in
the
wooden
arm
-
chair
,
but
my
arm
and
leg
be
bind
with
rope
,
while
the
chair
itself
have
be
secure
to
four
iron
ring
screw
into
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
over
my
mouth
be
bind
a
cloth
so
that
I
could
not
speak
.
 
<EOS>
before
me
,
his
thin
face
distort
by
a
hideous
,
almost
demoniacal
laugh
of
triumph
,
stand
old
Van
Nierop
,
watch
me
as
I
recover
consciousness
.
<EOS>
at
his
side
,
grin
in
triumph
,
be
my
master
,
the
Baron
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
to
ask
the
meaning
of
it
all
,
but
be
unable
.
 
<EOS>
"
see
,
see
!
<EOS>
"
cry
the
old
dutchman
,
point
with
his
bony
finger
to
the
dirty
table
near
me
,
whereon
a
candle
-
end
be
burn
straight
before
my
eye
beside
a
good
-
sized
book
--
a
leather
-
bind
ledger
it
appear
to
be
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
you
know
what
I
intend
do
?
<EOS>
well
,
I
be
go
to
treat
you
as
all
english
spy
should
be
treat
.
<EOS>
that
candle
will
burn
low
in
five
minute
and
sever
the
string
you
see
which
join
the
wick
.
<EOS>
look
what
that
innocent
-
look
book
contain
!
"
<EOS>
and
with
a
peal
of
discordant
laughter
he
lift
the
cover
,
show
,
to
my
horror
,
that
it
be
a
box
<EOS>
,
wherein
repose
a
small
glass
tube
fill
with
some
yellow
liquid
,
a
trigger
hold
back
by
the
string
,
and
some
square
packet
wrap
in
oiled
paper
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
what
this
be
!
"
<EOS>
he
say
slowly
and
distinctly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
moment
the
string
be
burn
through
,
the
hammer
will
fall
,
and
this
house
will
be
blow
to
atom
.
<EOS>
that
book
contain
the
most
powerful
explosive
know
to
science
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
demand
an
explanation
,
for
though
I
struggle
,
I
could
not
speak
.
 
<EOS>
I
watch
the
old
man
finger
with
fiendish
delight
the
terrible
machine
he
have
devise
for
my
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
and
your
friend
Raymond
think
to
trap
us
!
"
say
the
Baron
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
,
you
see
,
he
who
laugh
last
laugh
best
.
<EOS>
adieu
,
and
I
wish
you
a
pleasant
trip
,
my
young
friend
,
into
the
next
world
,
"
and
both
go
out
,
close
the
door
after
them
.
 
<EOS>
all
be
silence
.
<EOS>
I
sit
there
helpless
,
pinion
,
stare
at
the
burn
candle
and
await
the
most
awful
death
that
can
await
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
ah
,
those
moment
!
<EOS>
how
can
I
ever
adequately
describe
them
?
<EOS>
suffice
it
to
say
that
my
hair
be
dark
on
that
morning
,
but
in
those
terrible
moment
of
mental
agony
,
of
fear
and
horror
,
it
become
streak
with
grey
.
 
<EOS>
low
and
still
lower
burn
the
flame
,
steadily
,
imperceptibly
,
<EOS>
yet
,
alas
!
<EOS>
too
sure
.
<EOS>
each
second
bring
me
nearer
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
face
to
face
with
death
.
 
<EOS>
frantically
<EOS>
and
fiercely
I
fight
to
wrench
myself
free
--
<EOS>
fight
until
a
great
exhaustion
fall
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
as
the
candle
have
burn
until
the
flame
be
actually
touch
that
thin
string
which
hold
me
between
life
and
death
,
I
faint
.
 
<EOS>
a
blind
flash
,
a
terrific
explosion
that
deafen
me
,
and
a
feeling
of
sudden
numbness
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
myself
lie
on
the
path
outside
with
two
man
at
my
side
.
 
<EOS>
one
be
a
dark
-
bearded
,
thick
-
set
,
but
gentlemanly
-
looking
man
--
<EOS>
the
other
be
Ray
Raymond
.
 
<EOS>
of
the
house
where
I
have
be
,
scarcely
anything
remain
save
its
foundation
.
<EOS>
the
big
tree
in
the
garden
have
be
shatter
and
tear
down
,
and
every
window
in
the
neighbourhood
have
be
blow
in
,
to
the
intense
alarm
of
hundred
of
people
who
be
now
rush
along
the
dark
,
unfrequented
thoroughfare
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
God
!
"
cry
Ray
.
<EOS>
"
what
a
narrow
escape
you
have
have
!
<EOS>
why
do
not
you
take
my
advice
?
<EOS>
It
be
fortunate
that
,
suspect
something

we
follow
you
here

<EOS>
this
gentleman

he
say
,
introduce
his
friend

of
the
Special
Department
at
Scotland
Yard

<EOS>
We
just
discover
you
in
time

<EOS>
Old
Van
Nierop
run
inside
again
when
he
meet
us
in
the
path
.
<EOS>
He
think
he
have
time
to
escape
through
the
back
,
but
he
have
not
.
<EOS>
He
be
be
blow
to
atom
himself
,
as
well
as
the
Baron
,
and
thus
save
us
the
trouble
of
extradition
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
too
exhausted
and
confuse
to
reply
.
<EOS>
besides
,
a
huge
crowd
be
already
gather
,
the
fire
-
brigade
have
come
up
,
and
the
police
seem
to
be
examine
the
debris
strew
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
watch
the
Baron
<EOS>
well
,
but
not
quite
well
enough
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Jacox
,
"
Ray
say
.
<EOS>
"
They
evidently
suspect
you
of
pry
into
their
business
,
and
plot
to
put
you
quietly
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
You
have
evidently
somehow
betray
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
what
be
their
business
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
<EOS>
"
I
search
every
scrap
of
paper
in
the
Baron
's
room
,
but
be
never
able
to
discover
anything
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
the
truth
be
that
the
reason
the
Baron
come
to
England
be
in
order
to
take
a
house
in
this
secluded
spot
.
<EOS>
aid
by
Van
Nierop
they
have
establish
a
depot
close
by
in
readiness
for
the
coming
of
the
Kaiser
's
army
.
<EOS>
come
with
me
and
let
us
investigate
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
lead
me
to
a
stable
at
the
rear
of
another
house
about
fifty
yard
distant
,
he
,
aid
by
Bellamy
,
break
open
the
padlocked
door
.
 
<EOS>
within
we
find
great
pile
of
small
,
strongly
bind
box
contain
rifle
ammunition
,
together
with
about
sixty
case
of
old
Martini
-
Henry
rifle
,
weapon
still
very
serviceable
at
close
quarter
,
a
quantity
of
revolver
,
and
ten
case
of
gun
-
cotton
--
quite
a
formidable
store
of
arm
and
ammunition
,
similar
to
that
we
find
in
Essex
,
and
intend
,
no
doubt
,
for
the
arming
of
the
horde
of
Germans
already
in
London
on
the
day
when
the
Kaiser
give
the
signal
for
the
dash
upon
our
shore
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
only
one
of
the
depot
establish
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
metropolis
,
"
Raymond
say
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
other
,
and
we
must
set
to
work
to
discover
them

<EOS>
Germany
leave
nothing

there
be
already
in
London
fifty
thousand

<EOS>
at
the
signal
of

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
the
Baron
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
,
half
dazed
.
<EOS>
"
where
be
he
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
have
just
recover
portion
of
him
,
"
reply
Ray
,
with
a
grin
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
that
New
Year
's
card
!
<EOS>
"
I
exclaim
,
and
then
amid
the
excitement
proceed
to
tell
Bellamy
and
my
companion
what
have
happen
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
message
you
send
to
Manchester
be
to
acquaint
Hartmann
,
who
be
stay
at
this
moment
at
the
Midland
Grand
Hotel
,
with
their
intend
vengeance
upon
you
,
my
dear
old
chap
.
<EOS>
Nierop
be
a
dutch
merchant
in
the
City
,
and
his
habit
be
to
import
arm
and
ammunition
in
small
quantity
,
and
distribute
them
to
the
different
secret
depot
,
one
of
which
we
know
be
somewhere
near
the
'
Adelaide
,
'
in
Chalk
Farm
Road
,
another
be
at
a
house
in
Malmesbury
Road
,
<EOS>
Canning
Town
,
a
third
in
Shepperton
Street
,
Hoxton
,
and
a
fourth
be
say
to
be
close
by
the
chapel
in
Cowley
Road
,
Leytonstone
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
there
be
other
besides
,
"
remark
Bellamy
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
remark
Raymond
,
"
one
be
certainly
somewhere
in
Crowland
Road
,
South
Tottenham
,
another
near
the
gas
work
at
Hornsey
,
and
other
somewhere
between
Highgate
Hill
and
the
New
River
reservoir
.
<EOS>
besides
,
there
be
no
doubt
several
in
such
town
as
Ipswich
,
Chelmsford
,
Yarmouth
,
and
Norwich
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
police
have
by
this
time
take
possession
of
the
stable
,
but
no
information
be
give
to
the
public
,
fear
that
a
panic
may
be
cause
if
the
truth
leak
out
.
 
<EOS>
so
the
newspaper
and
the
public
believe
the
death
of
the
german
and
the
dutchman
to
be
due
to
a
gas
explosion
--
at
least
that
be
what
the
police
report
at
the
inquest
.
<EOS>
next
day
the
arm
and
ammunition
be
quietly
remove
in
closed
van
from
the
house
and
stable
which
the
spy
have
rent
,
and
convey
to
safe
keeping
at
Woolwich
--
where
,
I
believe
,
they
still
remain
as
evidence
of
the

Londoners

sadly
disregard
the
peril
in

they

already
in

an

guard
of
the

already
on

await
the

of
their

CHAPTER

how
GERMANY

<EOS>
Ray
Raymond
have
be
engage
watch
the
house
of
Hermann
Hartmann
in
Pont
Street
ever
since
our
discovery
of
the
secret
store
of
arm
and
ammunition
down
at
Chiswick
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
absent
at
Devonport
,
keep
observation
upon
the
movement
of
two
Germans
who
have
once
or
twice
pay
visit
to
Hartmann
,
and
who
have
evidently
receive
his
instruction
personally
.
<EOS>
the
two
man
in
question
be
know
to
us
as
spy
,
for
with
two
other
compatriot
we
have
find
them
,
only
three
month
before
,
busily
engage
in
prepare
a
plan
of
the
water
-
main
of
East
London
,
in
order
that
,
in
case
of
invasion
,
some
of
the
german
colony
could
destroy
the
principal
main
and
thus
deprive
half
the
metropolis
of
drinking
-
water
.
 
<EOS>
in
Leeds
<EOS>
they
have
,
we
know
,
map
out
the
whole
water
-
supply
,
as
Barker
have
do
at
North
Shields
;
and
again
in
Sheffield
,
the
plan
of
which
be
in
Berlin
;
but
fortunately
we
have
discover
them
at
work
in
London
,
and
have
be
able
to
prevent
them
from
accomplish
their
object
.
<EOS>
two
of
the
man
have
return
to
Germany
on
be
detect
,
and
the
other
two
be
now
at
Devonport
,
where
I
have
be
live
for
a
month
in
irritate
inactivity
.
 
<EOS>
one
afternoon
,
on
receipt
of
a
telegram
from
Ray
,
I
immediately
return
to
London
,
and
as
I
enter
the
flat
in
Bruton
Street
,
my
friend
say
:
 
"
the
great
_
agent
provocateur
_
of
the
german
Government
,
our
friend
Hermann
Hartmann
,
have
leave
for
Russia
,
Jack
.
<EOS>
His
employer
have
send
him
there
for
some
special
reason
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
wise
for
you
to
follow
,
and
ascertain
the
late
move
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
think
so
,
I
will
go
,
"
I
say
readily
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
take
my
place
down
at
Devonport
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
there
too
long
and
may
be
spot
.
<EOS>
where
have
Hartmann
go
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
first
back
to
Berlin
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
order
to
go
to
Poland
on
a
special
mission
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
must
pick
him
up
in
Berlin
,
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
and
thus
it
be
arrange
.
<EOS>
next
morning
I
obtain
a
special
_
visa
_
to
my
passport
from
the
russian
Ambassador
,
whom
I
chance
to
know
personally
,
and
at
2.20
leave
Charing
Cross
for
Calais
,
bind
for
Berlin
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
puzzle
why
Hartmann
,
the
most
trust
agent
of
the
Kaiser
's
secret
police
,
should
be
so
suddenly
transfer
to
russian
territory
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
temporarily
,
no
doubt
,
but
it
behove
us
to
have
knowledge
of
what
may
be
in
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
winter
,
and
the
journey
to
the
german
capital
be
cold
and
cheerless
.
<EOS>
yet
I
have
not
be
there
six
hour
before
I
have
discover
that
Hartmann
have
leave
for
a
place
call
Ostrog
,
in
Eastern
Poland
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
I
lose
no
time
in
set
forth
for
that
rather
obscure
place
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
nowadays
my
life
be
a
strange
one
,
full
of
romance
and
constant
change
,
of
excitement
--
and
sometimes
of
insecurity
.
 
<EOS>
for
what
reason
have
the
great
Hartmann
be
send
so
far
afield
?
 
<EOS>
on
leave
the
railway
,
I
travel
for
two
day
in
a
sleigh
over
those
endless
snow
-
cover
road
and
dark
forest
,
until
my
horse
,
with
their
jingling
bell
,
pull
up
before
a
small
inn
on
the
outskirt
of
the
dismal
-
look
town
of
Ostrog
.
<EOS>
the
place
,
with
its
roof
cover
with
freshly
-
fall
snow
,
lie
upon
the
slight
slope
of
a
low
hill
,
beneath
which
wind
the
Wilija
Goryn
,
now
freeze
so
hard
that
the
bridge
be
hardly
ever
use
.
<EOS>
It
be
January
,
and
that
month
in
Poland
be
always
a
cold
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
cross
the
frontier
at
the
little
village
of
Kolodno
,
and
thence
drive
along
the
valley
into
Volynien
,
a
long
,
weary
,
dispirit
drive
,
on
and
on
until
those
bell
madden
me
by
their
monotonous
rhythm
.
<EOS>
cramped
and
cold
<EOS>
I
be
,
notwithstanding
the
big
fur
coat
<EOS>
I
wear
,
the
fur
cap
with
flap
,
fur
glove
,
and
fur
rug
.
<EOS>
the
country
inn
in
which
I
have
spend
the
past
two
night
have
be
filthy
place
where
the
stove
have
be
surround
by
evil
-
smell
peasantry
,
where
the
food
be
uneatable
and
where
a
wooden
bench
have
serve
me
as
a
bed
.
 
<EOS>
at
each
stage
where
we
change
horse
the
post
-
house
keeper
have
hold
up
his
hand
when
he
know
my
destination
be
Ostrog
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Red
Rooster
"
be
crow
there
,
they
say
significantly
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
.
<EOS>
Russia
be
under
the
Terror
again
,
and
in
no
place
in
the
whole
empire
be
the
revolutionist
so
determined
as
in
the
town
whither
I
be
bind
.
<EOS>
I
see
at
once
the
reason
why
Hartmann
be
there
--
to
secretly
stir
up
strife
,
for
it
be
to
the
advantage
of
Germany
that
Russia
should
be
in
a
state
of
unrest
.
<EOS>
to
observe
the
german
method
be
certainly
interesting
.
 
<EOS>
Ostrog
at
last
!
<EOS>
as
I
stand
up
and
descend
unsteadily
from
my
sleigh
my
eye
fall
upon
something
upon
the
snow
near
the
door
of
the
inn
.
<EOS>
there
be
blood
.
<EOS>
It
tell
its
own
tale
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
white
town
across
the
frozen
river
I
hear
revolver
shot
,
follow
by
a
loud
explosion
that
shake
the
whole
place
and
startle
the
three
horse
in
my
sleigh
.
 
<EOS>
inside
the
long
,
low
,
common
room
of
the
inn
,
with
its
high
brick
stove
,
against
which
half
a
dozen
frighten
-
look
man
and
woman
be
huddle
,
I
ask
for
the
proprietor
,
whereupon
an
elderly
man
,
with
shaggy
hair
and
beard
,
come
forth
,
pull
his
forelock
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
stay
here
,
"
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
your
excellency
,
"
be
the
old
fellow
's
reply
,
in
Polish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
whatever
accommodation
my
poor
inn
can
afford
be
at
your
service"--and
<EOS>
he
at
once
shout
order
to
my
driver
to
bring
in
my
kit
,
while
the
woman
,
all
of
them
flat
-
faced
peasant
,
make
room
for
me
at
the
stove
.
 
<EOS>
from
where
I
stand
I
could
hear
the
sound
of
desultory
fire
across
the
bridge
,
and
inquire
what
be
in
progress
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
an
ominous
silence
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
reply
,
for
,
as
I
afterwards
discover
,
they
have
take
me
for
a
high
police
official
from
Petersburg
,
thus
account
for
the
innkeeper
's
courtesy
.
 
<EOS>
"
tell
me
,
"
I
say
,
address
the
wrinkle
-
face
old
Pole
,
"
what

over
yonder

<EOS>
"
the
Cossacks

.
<EOS>
"
Krasiloff
and
his
Cossacks
be
upon
us
.
<EOS>
They
have
just
enter
the
town
and
be
shoot
down
people
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Hartmann
,
the
great
patriot
from
Germany
,
have
arrive
,
and
the
fight
for
freedom
have
commence
,
excellency
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
horrible
.
<EOS>
a
poor
woman
be
shoot
dead
before
my
door
half
an
hour
ago
,
and
her
body
take
away
by
the
soldier
.
"
 
<EOS>
tired
as
I
be
,
I
lose
no
time
.
<EOS>
with
a
glance
to
see
that
my
own
revolver
be
load
,
I
throw
aside
my
overcoat
,
and
,
leave
the
inn
,
walk
across
the
bridge
into
a
poor
narrow
street
of
wretched
-
look
house
,
many
of
them
build
of
wood
.
<EOS>
a
man
limp
slowly
past
me
,
wound
in
the
leg
,
and
leave
blood
-
spot
behind
him
as
he
go
.
<EOS>
an
old
woman
be
seat
in
a
doorway
,
her
face
bury
in
her
hand
,
wail
:
 
"
<EOS>
My
poor
son!--dead!--dead
!
"
 
<EOS>
before
me
I
see
a
great
barricade
compose
of
tree
,
household
furniture
,
paving
-
stone
,
overturn
cart
,
piece
of
barbed
wire
--
in
fact
,
everything
and
anything
the
populace
could
seize
upon
for
the
construction
of
hasty
defence
.
<EOS>
upon
the
top
,
silhouette
against
the
clear
frosty
sky
,
be
the
scarlet
flag
of
the
revolution
--
the
Red
Rooster
be
crow
!
 
<EOS>
excited
man
be
there
,
arm
with
rifle
,
shout
and
give
order
.
<EOS>
then
I
see
that
a
small
space
have
be
leave
open
against
the
wall
of
a
house
so
that
person
may
pass
and
repass
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
approach
a
wild
-
haired
man
shout
to
me
and
beckon
frantically
.
<EOS>
I
grasp
his
meaning
.
<EOS>
He
wish
me
to
come
within
.
<EOS>
I
run
forward
,
enter
the
town
proper
,
and
a
few
moment
later
the
opening
be
close
by
a
dozen
slab
of
stone
be
heap
up
into
it
by
as
many
willing

<EOS>
thus
I
find
myself
in
the
very
centre
of
the
revolution
,
behind
the
barricade
,
of
which
there
be

it
seem

six

seven

<EOS>
from

there
be
constant

and

I
be

about

I
fail
to

<EOS>
perhaps

most

above

suddenly
round

a

a
Cossack
bullet
.
 
<EOS>
the
situation
be
,
for
me
,
one
of
great
peril
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
no
opportunity
of
find
the
governor
of
the
town
to
present
my
credential
,
and
thus
obtain
protection
.
<EOS>
the
whole
place
be
in
open
revolt
,
and
when
the
troop
break
down
the
defence
,
as
I
see
they
must
do
sooner
or
later
,
then
we
should
all
be
catch
in
a
trap
,
and
no
quarter
would
be
give
.
 
<EOS>
the
massacre
would
be
the
same
as
at
Moscow
and
many
other
town
in
Western
Russia
,
wherein
the
populace
have
be
shoot
down
indiscriminately
,
and
official
telegram
have
be
send
to
Petersburg
report
"
order
now
reign
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
seek
shelter
in
a
doorway
,
but
scarcely
have
I
do
so
than
a
bullet
embed
itself
in
the
woodwork
a
few
inch
from
my
head
.
<EOS>
at
the
barricade
the
woman
be
help
the
man
,
load
their
rifle
for
them
,
shout
and
encourage
them
to
fight
gallantly
for
freedom
.
<EOS>
and
suddenly
I
catch
sight
of
Hartmann
's
evil
face
.
<EOS>
He
be
calmly
talk
to
a
man
who
be
no
doubt
also
in
the
german
employ
.
<EOS>
the
rise
be
their
work
!
 
<EOS>
a
yellow
-
haired
young
woman
,
not
more
than
twenty
,
emerge
from
a
house
close
by
where
I
stand
and
run
past
me
to
the
barricade
.
<EOS>
as
she
pass
I
see
that
she
carry
something
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
It
look
like
a
small
cylinder
of
metal
.
 
<EOS>
shout
to
a
man
who
be
fire
through
a
loophole
near
the
top
of
the
barricade
,
she
hand
it
up
to
him
.
<EOS>
take
it
carefully
,
he
scramble
up
higher
,
wait
for
a
few
moment
,
and
then
,
raise
himself
,
he
hurl
it
far
into
the
air
into
the
midst
of
an
advance
troop
of
Cossacks
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
red
flash
,
a
terrific
explosion
which
shake
the
whole
town
,
wreck
the
house
in
the
immediate
vicinity
,
and
blow
to
atom
dozen
of
the
Czar
's
soldier
.
 
<EOS>
a
wild
shout
of
victory
go
up
from
the
revolutionist
when
they
see
the
havoc
cause
by
the
awful
bomb
.
<EOS>
the
yellow
-
haired
girl
return
again
and
bring
another
,
which
,
after
some
ten
minute
or
so
,
be
similarly
hurl
against
the
troop
,
with
equally
disastrous
effect
.
 
<EOS>
the
roadway
be
strew
with
the
body
of
those
Cossacks
which
General
Kinski
,
the
governor
of
the
town
,
have
telegraph
for
,
and
whom
Krasiloff
have
order
to
give
no
quarter
to
the
revolutionist
.
<EOS>
in
Western
Russia
the
name
of
Krasiloff
be
synonymous
with
all
that
be
cruel
and
brutal
.
<EOS>
It
be
he
who
order
the
flogging
of
the
five
young
woman
at
Minsk
,
those
poor
unfortunate
creature
who
be
knoute
by
cossack
who
lay
their

<EOS>
as
every
one
in
Russia

two
of
them

both
member
of
good
family
,
die
within
a
few
hour
,
and
yet
no
reprimand
do
he
receive
from
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
by
the
Czar
and
at
the
Ministry
of
the
Interior
he
be
know
to
be
a
hard
man
,
and
for
that
reason
certain
town
where
the
revolutionary
spirit
be
strong
have
be
give
into
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
at
Kiev
he
have
execute
without
trial
dozen
of
man
and
woman
arrest
for
revolutionary
act
.
<EOS>
a
common
grave
be
dig
in
the
prison
yard
,
and
the
victim
,
four
at
a
time
,
be
lead
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
pit
and
shoot
,
each
batch
be
compel
to
witness
the
execution
of
the
four
prisoner
precede
them
.
<EOS>
with
a
refinement
of
cruelty
that
be
only
equal
by
the
Inquisition
,
he
have
wrung
confession
from
woman
,
and
afterwards
have
them
shoot
and
bury
.
<EOS>
at
Petersburg
they
know
these
thing
,
but
he
have
actually
be
commend
and
decorate
for
his
loyalty
to
the
Czar
!
 
<EOS>
and
now
that
he
have
be
hurriedly
move
to
ostrog
the
people
know
that
his
order
to
the
Cossacks
be
to
massacre
the
people
,
and
more
especially
the
jewish
portion
of
the
population
,
without
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Krasiloff
be
here
!
"
say
the
man
whose
face
be
smear
with
blood
as
he
stand
by
me
.
"
<EOS>
He
intend
that
we
shall
all
die
,
but
we
will
fight
for
it
.
<EOS>
the
revolution
have
only
just
commence
.
<EOS>
soon
the
peasant
will
rise
,
and
we
will
sweep
the
country
clean
of
the
vermin
the
Czar

place
upon
us
.
<EOS>
to
-
day
Kinski
,
the
governor
,
have
be
fire
at
twice
,
but
unsuccessfully
.
<EOS>
He
want
a
bomb

and
he
shall
have
it

"
he
add
meaningly
.
<EOS>
"
Olga

the
girl
yonder
with
the
yellow
hair

one
for
him!"--and
he
laugh
grimly
.
 
<EOS>
I
recognise
my
own
deadly
peril
.
<EOS>
I
stand
revolver
in
hand
,
though
I
have
not
fire
a
shot
,
for
I
be
no
revolutionist
.
<EOS>
I
be
only
await
the
inevitable
breaking
down
of
the
barricade
--
and
the
awful
catastrophe
that
must
befall
the
town
when
those
Cossacks
,
drunk
with
the
lust
for
blood
,
sweep
into
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
around
me
man
and
woman
be
shout
themselves
hoarse
,
while
the
red
emblem
of
Terror
still
wave
lazily
from
the
top
of
the
barricade
.
<EOS>
the
man
man
the
improvise
defence
keep
up
a
wither
fire
upon
the
troop
,
who
in
the
open
road
be
afford
no
cover
.
<EOS>
time
after
time
the
place
shake
as
those
terrible
bomb
explode
with
awful
result
,
for
the
yellow
-
haired
girl
seem
to
keep
up
a
continuous
supply
of
them
.
<EOS>
They
be
only
seven
or
eight
inch
long
,
but
hurl
into
a
company
of
soldier
their
effect
be
deadly
.
 
<EOS>
for
half
an
hour
longer
it
seem
as
though
the
defence
of
the
town
would
be
effectual
,
yet
,
of
a
sudden
,
the
redouble
shout
of
those
about
me
tell
me
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
the
Cossacks
have
be
reinforce
,
and
be
about
to
rush
the
barricade
.
 
<EOS>
I
manage
to
peer
forth
,
and
there
,
surely
enough
,
the
whole
roadway
be
fill
with
soldier
.
 
<EOS>
Yells
,
curse
,
heavy
firing
,
man
fall
back
from
the
barricade
to
die
around
me
,
and
<EOS>
the
disappearance
of
the
red
flag
show
that
the
Cossacks
be
at
last
scale
the
great
pile
of
miscellaneous
object
that
block
the
street
.
<EOS>
a
dozen
of
the
Czar
's
soldier
appear
silhouette
against
the
sky
as
they
scramble
across
the
top
of
the
barricade
,
but
the
next
second
a
dozen
corpse
fall
to
earth
,
riddle
by
the
bullet
of
the
man

below
in
readiness
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
moment
,
however

in
their
place
,
and
still
more
and
more

<EOS>
woman
throw
up
their

in
despair
and
flee
for
their
life
,
while
man
--
calmly
prepared
to
die
in
the
cause
--
shout
again
and
again
,
"

Krasiloff
and
the
Czar

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
stand
undecided
.
<EOS>
I
be
face
death
.
<EOS>
those
Cossacks
with
order
to
massacre
would
give
no
quarter
,
and
would
not
discriminate
.
<EOS>
Krasiloff
be
wait
for
his
dastardly
order
to
be
carry
out
.
<EOS>
the
Czar
have
give
him
instruction
to
crush
the
revolution
by
whatever
mean
he
think
proper
.
 
<EOS>
those
moment
of
suspense
seem
hour
.
<EOS>
suddenly
there
be
another
flash
,
a
stunning
report
,
the
air
be
fill
with
debris
,
and
a
great
breach
open
in
the
barricade
.
<EOS>
the
Cossacks
have
use
explosive
to
clear
away
the
obstruction
.
<EOS>
next
instant
they
be
upon
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
fly
--
fly
for
my
life
.
<EOS>
whither
my
leg
carry
me
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
woman
's
despairing
shriek
rent
the
air
on
every
hand
.
<EOS>
the
massacre
have
commence
.
<EOS>
I
remember
I
dash
into
a
long
,
narrow
street
that
seem
half
desert
,
then
turn
corner
after
corner
,
but
behind
me
,
ever
increase
,
rise
the
cry
of
the
doom
populace
.
<EOS>
the
Cossacks
be
follow
the
people
into
their
house
and
kill
man
,
woman
,
and
even
child
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
,
as
I
turn
into
a
side
street
,
I
see
that
it
lead
into
a
large
open
thoroughfare
,
the
main
road
through
the
town
,
I
expect
.
<EOS>
and
there
,
straight
before
me
,
I
see
that
an
awful
scene
be
be
enact
.
 
<EOS>
I
turn
to
run
back
,
but
at
that
instant
a
woman
's
long
,
despairing
cry
reach
me
,
cause
me
to
glance
within
a
doorway
,
where
stand
a
big
,
brutal
Cossack
,
who
have
pursue
and
capture
a
pretty
,
dark
-
haired
,
well
-
dress
girl
.
 
<EOS>
"
save
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
shriek
as
I
pass
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
save
me
,
sir
!
"
she
gasp
,
white
,
terrified
,
and
breathless
with
struggle
.
<EOS>
"
He
will
kill
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
burly
soldier
have
his
bearded
face
close
down
to
her
,
his
arm
clasp
around
her
,
and
have
evidently
force
her
from
the
street
into
the
entry
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
second
I
hesitate
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
sir
,
save
me
!
<EOS>
save
me
,
and
God
will
reward
you
!
"
<EOS>
she
implore
,
her
big
,
dark
eye
turn
to
mine
in
final
appeal
.
 
<EOS>
the
fellow
at
that
moment
raise
his
fist
and
strike
her
a
brutal
blow
upon
the
mouth
that
cause
the
blood
to
flow
,
say
with
a
savage
growl
:
 
<EOS>
"
be
quiet
,
will
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
let
that
woman
go
!
"
<EOS>
I
command
in
the
good
russian
I
could
.
 
<EOS>
in
an
instant
,
with
a
glare
in
his
fiery
eye
,
for
the
blood
-
lust
be
within
him
,
he
turn
upon
me
and
sneeringly
ask
who
I
be
to
give
him
order
,
while
the
poor
girl
reel
,
half
stun
by
his
blow
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
her
go
<EOS>
I
say
!
<EOS>
"
I
shout
,
advance
quickly
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
a
moment
he
have
draw
his
big
army
revolver
,
and
,
ere
<EOS>
I
become
aware
of
his
dastardly
intention
,
he
raise
it
to
a
few
inch
from
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
Quick
<EOS>
as
think
I
raise
my
own
weapon
,
which
I
have
hold
behind
me
,
and
<EOS>
,
be
accredit
a
fairly
good
shot
,
I
fire
in
an
endeavour
to
save
the
poor
girl
.
 
<EOS>
fortunately
my
bullet
strike
,
for
he
step
back
,
his
revolver
drop
from
his
finger
upon
the
stone
,
and
,
stumble
forward
,
he
fall
dead
at
her
foot
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
My
shot
have
,
I
see
,
hit
him
in
the
temple
,
and
death
have
probably
be
instantaneous
.
 
<EOS>
with
a
cry
of
joy
at
her
sudden
release
,
the
girl
rush
across
to
me
,
and
raise
my
left
hand
to
her
lip
,
kiss
it
,
at
the
same
time
thank
me
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
I
recognise
how
uncommonly
pretty
she
be
.
<EOS>
not
more
than
eighteen
<EOS>
,
she
be
slim
and
petite
,
with
a
narrow
waist
and
graceful
figure
--
quite
unlike
in
refinement
and
in
dress
<EOS>
the
other
woman
I
have
see
in
Ostrog
.
<EOS>
Her
dark
hair
have
come
unbound
in
her
desperate
struggle
with
the
Cossack
and
hang
about
her
shoulder
,
her
bodice
be
tear
and
reveal
a
bare
white
neck
,
and
her
chest
heave
and
fall
as
in
breathless
,
disjoint
sentence
she
thank
me
again
and
again
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
second
to
lose
,
however
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
I
recognise
,
a
Jewess
,
and
Krasiloff
's
order
be
not
to
spare
them
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
main
street
beyond
rise
the
shout
and
scream
,
the
firing
and
wild
triumphant
yell
as
the
terrible
massacre
progress
.
 
<EOS>
"
come
with
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
cry
breathlessly
.
<EOS>
"
along
here
.
<EOS>
I
know
of
a
place
of
safety
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
she
lead
the
way
,
run
swiftly
for
about
two
hundred
yard
,
and
then
,
turn
into
a
narrow
,
dirty
courtyard
,
pass
through
an
evil
,
forbid
-
looking
house
,
where
all
be
silent
as
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
with
a
key
she
quickly
open
the
door
of
a
poor
,
ill
-
furnished
room
,
which
she
close
behind
her
,
but
do
not
lock
.
<EOS>
then
,
open
a
door
on
the
opposite
side
,
which
have
be
paper
over
so
as
to
escape
observation
,
I
see
there
be
a
flight
of
damp
stone
stair
lead
down
to
a
cellar
or
some
subterranean
region
beneath
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
down
here
!
"
she
say
,
take
a
candle
,
light
it
,
and
hand
it
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
go
--
I
will
follow
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
descend
cautiously
into
the
cold
,
dank
place
,
discover
it
to
be
a
kind
of
unlighted
cellar
hew
out
of
the
rock
.
<EOS>
a
table
,
a
chair
,
a
lamp
,
and
some
provision
show
that
preparation
have
be
make
for
concealment
there
,
but
ere
I
have
entirely
explore
the
place
my
pretty
fellow
-
fugitive
rejoin
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
,
I
hope
,
be
a
place
of
safety
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
They
will
not
find
us
here
.
<EOS>
this
be
where
Gustave
live
before
his
flight
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Gustave
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
,
look
her
straight
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
She
drop
her
eye
and
blush
.
<EOS>
Her
silence
tell
its
own
tale
.
<EOS>
the
previous
occupant
of
that
rock
chamber
be
her
lover
.
 
<EOS>
Her
name
be
Luba
--
Luba
Lazareff
,
she
tell
me
.
<EOS>
but
of
herself
she
would
tell
me
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
Her
reticence
be
curious
,
yet
before
long
I
recognise
the
reason
of
her
refusal
.
 
<EOS>
in
reply
to
further
question
she
say
:
"
the
Germans
be
our
friend
.
<EOS>
two
man
from
Berlin
have
be
in
Ostrog
nearly
a
month
hold
secret
meeting
and
urge
us
to

She

He

if
possible

over
the
hill

the
frontier
at
Satanow

<EOS>
I
see
that
she
be
deeply
in
love
with
the
fugitive
,
whoever
he
may
be

<EOS>
outside
the
awful
massacre
be
in
progress
,
we
know
;
but
no
sound
of
it
reach
us
down
in
that
rock
-
hew
tomb

<EOS>
the
yellow
candle
-
light
fall
upon
her
sweet
dimpled
face
,
but
when
she
turn
her
splendid
eye
to
mine
I
see
that
in
them
be
a
look
of
anxiety
and
terror
inexpressible
.
 
<EOS>
I
inquire
of
her
father
and
mother
,
for
she
be
of
a
superior
class
,
as
I
have
from
the
first
moment
detect
.
<EOS>
She
speak
French
extremely
well
,
and
we
have
drop
into
that
language
as
be
easy
for
me
than
Russian
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
can
it
matter
to
you
,
sir
,
a
stranger
?
<EOS>
"
she
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
be
interested

you

mademoiselle

"
I
answer
.
<EOS>
"
have
I
not

she
cry
quickly

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
again
she
seize
both
my

them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hark

<EOS>
"
I
cry
,
startled
.
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
?
"
<EOS>
for
I
distinctly
hear
a
sound
of
crackle
wood
.
 
<EOS>
the
next
moment
man
's
gruff
voice
reach
us
from
above
.
 
<EOS>
"

Cossacks
!
<EOS>
"
she
scream
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
find

<EOS>
and
the
light
die
out
of
her
beautiful
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
in
her
tremble
hand
she
hold
the
terrible
little
engine
of
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
with
a
quick
movement
I
grip
her
wrist
,
urge
her
to
refrain
until
all
hope
be
abandon
,
and
together
we
stand
face
the
soldier
as
they
descend
the
stair
to
where
we
be

<EOS>
They
be
,
it
seem
,
search
every
house

<EOS>
"

they
cry
,
"

<EOS>
but
the
wall
be
hollow

and
reveal
the
door

"
<EOS>
and
next
moment
we
see
the
figure
of
man

<EOS>
"
well

<EOS>
"
exclaim
a

leer
Cossack

chuck
the
tremble

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
I
command
the
half

dozen
man
who
now
stand
before
us
,
their
sword
red
with
the
life

blood
of
the
Revolution

<EOS>
but
before
I
could
utter
further
word
the
poor
girl
be
wrench
from
my
grasp
,
and
the
Cossack
be
smother
her
face
with
his
hot
nauseous
kiss

<EOS>
"
Hulloa

they
laugh
.
<EOS>
"

one
of
the
man
raise
his
sword
to
strike
me
,
whilst
another
hold
him
back
,
exclaim
,

this

look
well
at
the
signature

at

He

at

grimly

sarcasm
spread
over

mournfully
forth

lump
arise
in

out

of
a
sudden

however

just
as
we
emerge
into

roadway

the
unfortunate

I

turn

fill
with
debris

completely
out

and
when
a
few
minute
later
I
summon
courage
to
enter
and
peep
within
the
wrecked
room

I
see
a
scene
that
I
dare
not
describe
here
in

<EOS>
suffice
<EOS>
it
to
say
that
the

what

neither

<EOS>
We

exert

good
deal
of
vigilance
and
keep
constant
watch
upon
Hartmann
's
house
in
Pont
Street
since
my
return
from

,
but
all
to
no
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Vera
have
be
stay
in
London
with
her
aunt
and
have
greatly
assist
us
in
keep
observation
upon
two
stranger
who
have
arrive
in
London
about
a
month
ago
,
and
who
be
stay
in
an
obscure
hotel
near
Victoria
Station
.
 
<EOS>
Their
name
be
Paul
Dubois
,
a
Belgian
,
and
Frederick
Gessner
,
a
German
.
<EOS>
the
first
-
name
be
,
we
judge
,
about
forty
,
stout
,
flabby
-
face
,
wear

,
while
the
German
be
somewhat
young
,
both
quiet
,
studious
-
look
man
who
seem
,
however
,
to
be
welcome
by
many
of
the
prominent
member
of
the
german
colony
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
on
five
separate
occasion
we
have
follow
the
pair
to
King
's
Cross
Station
and
watch
them
take
third
class
ticket
to
Hull
.
<EOS>
They
would
remain
there
perhaps
two
or
three
day
,
and
then
return
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
while
they
have
grow
tired
of
their
hotel
,
and
have
take
a
small
furnished
house
at
the
top
of
Sydenham
Hill
,
close
to
the
Crystal
Palace
,
a
pleasant
little
place
with
a
small
secluded
garden
in
which
be
several
high
old
elm
.
<EOS>
They
engage
a
rather
obese
old
Frenchwoman
as
housekeeper
,
and
there
they
lead
a
quiet
life
,
engross
apparently
in
literary
study
.
 
<EOS>
I
confess
that
when
it
come
my
turn
to
watch
them
I
become
more
than
ever
convince
that
Raymond
's
suspicion
be
ungrounded
.
<EOS>
They
seldom
go
out
,
and
when
they
do
,
it
be
either
to
dine
with
Hartmann
,
or
to
stroll
about
the
suburban
road
of
Norwood
,
Sydenham
,
and
Penge
.
 
<EOS>
late
one
afternoon
,
however
,
while
I
be
down
at
Sydenham
,
I
see
them
emerge
from
the
house
,
carry
their
small
suit
-
case
,
and
follow
them
to
King
's
Cross
Station
,
where
they
take
ticket
for
Hull
.
 
<EOS>
instantly
I
rush
to
the
telephone
and
inform
Ray
in
Bruton
Street
of
my
intention
to
follow
them
.
 
<EOS>
that
same
night
I
find
myself
in
the
smoke
-
grime
Station
Hotel
in
Hull
,
where
the
two
foreigner
have
also
put
up
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
they
call
at
a
solicitor
's
office
at
the
end
of
Whitefriargate
,
and
thence
,
accompany
by
a
man
who
be
apparently
the
lawyer
's
managing
clerk
,
they
go
in
a
cab
along
the
Docks
,
where
,
at
a
spot
close
to
the
Queen
's
Dock
,
they
pull
up
before
an
empty
factory
,
a
place
which
be
not
very
large
,
but
which
possess
a
very
high
chimney
.
 
<EOS>
the
managing
clerk
enter
the
premise
with
a
key
,
and
for
about
half
an
hour
the
pair
be
within
,
apparently
inspect
everything
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
puzzle
.
<EOS>
why
they
be
in
treaty
to
rent
a
place
of
this
description
be
an
utter
enigma
.
 
<EOS>
They
return
to
the
hotel
to
luncheon
,
and
I
watch
them
engage
in
animate
discussion
afterwards
,
and
I
also
notice
that
they
despatch
a
telegram
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
they
call
upon
the
solicitor
,
and
by
their
satisfied
manner
when
they
come
forth
from
the
office
,
I
guess
that
they
have
become
tenant
of
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
I
be
not
mistake
,
for
that
same
afternoon
they
go
together
to
the
factory
and
let
themselves
in
with
the
key
,
remain
within
for
over
an
hour
,
evidently
plan
something
.
 
<EOS>
that
night
I
write
a
long
report
to
Raymond
,
and
next
morning
speak
to
him
over
the
telephone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Vera
want
to
know
if
you
want
her
in
Hull
.
<EOS>
if
so
,
she
will
come
,
"
my
friend
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
just
as
puzzle
as
you
be
.
<EOS>
those
two
man
mean
mischief
--
but
in
what
manner
be
a
mystery
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
Miss
Vallance
can
come
,
I
will
be
only
too
thankful
,
"
<EOS>
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
fear
the
man
know
you
,
but
they
do
not
know
her
.
<EOS>
and
she
can
greatly
assist
me
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
well

Jacox

be
his
reply
.
<EOS>
"
She
will
leave
this
evening
.
<EOS>
She
will
wire
to
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
She
would
better
not
be
see
with
you
.
<EOS>
so
,
to
the
hotel
people
,
you
will
be
stranger
.
<EOS>
meet
outside

and
arrange
matter

<EOS>
phone
me
when
you
want
me
up
there
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
right
,
old
chap
,
"
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
ring
you
up
at
eleven
to
-
morrow
and
report
.
<EOS>
so
be
in
.
<EOS>
good
-
bye
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
I
ring
off
.
 
<EOS>
Vera
arrive
just
before
eleven
that
evening
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
the
hall
of
the
hotel
when
the
porter
enter
,
carry
her
dressing
-
case
.
<EOS>
She
pass
me
and
go
to
the
office
,
but
I
do
not
acknowledge
her
.
<EOS>
She
wear
a
neat
dark
blue
travel
gown
,
well
cut
by
her
tailor
,
and
a
little
toque
which
suit
her
face
admirably
.
<EOS>
She
possess
perfect
taste
in
dress
.
 
<EOS>
half
an
hour
later
I
send
a
note
up
to
her
room
by
a
waiter
,
ask
her
to
meet
me
outside
on
the
railway
platform
at
ten
o'clock
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
She
keep
the
appointment
,
and
in
order
to
escape
observation
we
enter
the
refreshment
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
number
of
the
room
occupy
by
the
two
man
be
sixty
-
eight
and
seventy
-
two
,
"
I
explain
.
<EOS>
"
perhaps
it
will
be
as
well
if
you
watch
them
<EOS>
the
whole
of
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
They
be
at
present
in
the
writing
-
room
,
so
you
can
at
once
pick
them
up
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
Mr.
Jacox
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
Jack
be
intensely
anxious
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
puzzled
as
to
what
they
intend
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
I
reply
,
"
it
be
quite
a
mystery
.
<EOS>
but
we
shall
discover
something
ere
long
,
never
fear
.
"
 
<EOS>
Vera
laugh
as
she
sip
the
glass
of
milk
I
have
order
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
briefly
explain
all
that
I
have
discover
,
tell
her
how
the
two
man
have
evidently
take
the
factory
on
a
lease
,
and
how
they
be
there
every
day
,
apparently
make
plan
for
future
business
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
what
business
do
they
intend
start
?
"
she
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
"
<EOS>
I
say
;
"
that
be
what
we
have
to
find
out
.
<EOS>
and
we
shall
do
so
before
very
long
,
if
we
be
careful
and
vigilant
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
trust
me
,
"
she
say
;
"
I
be
entirely
at
your
order
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
I
shall
wait
and
hear
your
report
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
when
you
return
to
the
hotel
send
a
line
to
my
room
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
with
that
arrangement
we
part
.
 
<EOS>
that
day
I
spend
idle
in
the
vicinity
of
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
It
be
mid
-
August
,
and
the
atmosphere
be
stifle
.
<EOS>
that
district
of
Hull
be
not
a
very
pleasant
one
,
for
it
be
one
of
mean
provincial
street
and
of
the
noise
of
railway
lorry
rumble
over
the
granite
setts
.
 
<EOS>
the
afternoon
I
spend
in
play
billiard
with
the
marker
,
when
about
six
o'clock
a
page
-
boy
bring
me
a
note
from
my
enthusiastic
little
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
in
the
station
refreshment
-
room
at
half
-
past
six
.
<EOS>
meet
me.--VERA
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
those
be
the
word
I
find
within
the
envelope
.
 
<EOS>
half
an
hour
later
,
when
I
sit
at
the
little
marble
-
top
table
with
her
,
she
relate
how
she
have
be
follow
the
pair
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
be
in
the
factory
from
half
-
past
one
until
four
,
"
she
say
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
order
a
builder
to
put
up
ladder
to
examine
the
chimney
.
<EOS>
They
appear
to
think
it
be
not
quite
safe
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
tell
me
the
name
of
the
builder
,
add
that
the
contract
be
to
have
the
ladder
in
position
during
the
next
three
day
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
be
leave
for
London
to
-
night
by
the
last
train
,
"
she
add
.
<EOS>
"
I
hear
the
Belgian
tell
the
hall
-
porter
as
I
come
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
then
we
will
wire
to
Ray
to
meet
them
,
and
keep
an
eye
upon
them
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
will
go
up
to
town
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
and
when
they
return
I
will
follow
them
down
if
Ray
deem
it
good
,
"
reply
the
pretty
girl
,
who
be
just
as
enthusiastic
in
her
patriotism
as
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
so
still
mystified
I
be
compel
to
remain
inactive
in
Hull
,
while
Vera
and
the
two
foreigner
whom
we
suspect
of
espionage
go
up
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
next
four
day
I
hear
nothing
until
suddenly
,
at
eight
o'clock
one
morning
,
Ray
enter
my
bedroom
before
I
be
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
find
out
one
thing
about
those
Johnnies
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
be
buy
,
in
Clerkenwell
,
a
whole
lot
of
electrical
appliance
--
coil
of
wire
,
insulator
,
and
battery
.
<EOS>
some
of
it
have
be
send
direct
to
the
place
they
have
take
here
,
and
the
rest
have
be
send
to
their
house
down
in
Sydenham
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
can
they
want
that
for
?
<EOS>
"
I
query
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
know
,
my
dear
chap
.
<EOS>
let
's
wait
and
see
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
perhaps
,
after
all
,
they
be
about
to
set
up
in
business
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
neither
of
them
have
strike
me
as
be
spy
.
<EOS>
save
that
they
have
visit
Hartmann
once
or
twice
,
their
movement
have
not
be
very
suspicious
.
<EOS>
many
foreigner
be
set
up
factory
in
England
,
owe
to
the
recent
change
in
our
patent
law
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
"
say
my
friend
.
"
<EOS>
yet
their
confidential
negotiation
with
Hartmann
have
arouse
my
suspicion
,
and
I
feel
confident
we
shall
discover
something
interesting
before
long
.
<EOS>
They
come
back
by
the
same
train
as
I
travel
.
"
 
<EOS>
after
breakfast
,
we
both
stroll
round
to
the
factory
.
<EOS>
the
ground
it
cover
be
not
much
,
and
it
be
surround
by
a
wall
about
twelve
foot
high
,
so
that
no
one
could
see
within
the
courtyard
.
<EOS>
It
have
,
at
one
time
,
be
a
lead
-
mill
,
but
for
the
past
eight
year
have
,
we
learn
,
be
untenanted
.
 
<EOS>
even
as
we
loiter
near
,
we
see
the
builder
's
man
bring
long
ladder
for
the
inspection
of
the
chimney
.
 
<EOS>
We
watch
for
a
whole
week
,
but
as
each
day
pass
,
I
become
more
confident
that
we
be
upon
a
false
scent
.
 
<EOS>
the
chimney
have
be
inspect
,
the
ladder
take
down
again
,
and
once
more
the
german
and
the
Belgian
have
return
south
to
that
pleasant
London
suburb
.
 
<EOS>
in
order
to
ascertain
what
be
really
in
progress
I
call
one
morning
upon
the
solicitor
in
Whitefriargate
,
on
pretext
of
be
a
likely
tenant
of
the
factory
.
<EOS>
I
be
,
however
,
inform
by
the
managing
clerk
that
it
be
already
let
to
a
firm
of
electrical
engineer
.
 
<EOS>
thus
the
purchase
of
electrical
appliance
be
entirely
account
for
.
 
<EOS>
once
again
I
return
to
London
.
<EOS>
They
seem
,
by
the
electrical
accessory
that
have
be
deliver
,
to
be
fit
up
a
second
factory
in
their
house
in
Sydenham
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
be
a
private
house
,
seem
somewhat
mysterious
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
become
friendly
also
with
a
tall
,
rather
well
-
dress
Englishman
name
Fowler
,
who
have
the
appearance
of
a
superior
clerk
,
and
who
reside
in
a
rather
nice
house
in
Hopton
Road
,
Streatham
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
Fowler
have
become
a
frequent
visitor
at
their
house
,
while
,
on
several
occasion
,
he
dine
with
Dubois
at
De
Keyser
's
hotel
,
face
Blackfriars
Bridge
.
 
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
some
conversation
<EOS>
I
one
evening
overheard
--
a
conversation
in
English
,
which
the
Belgian
speak
fluently
<EOS>
--
I
judge
Fowler
to
be
an
electrician
,
and
it
seem
,
later
on
,
very
much
as
though
he
have
be
,
or
be
about
to
be
,
take
into
partnership
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
as
far
as
we
could
discover
,
however
,
he
have
be
tell
nothing
about
the
factory
in
Hull
.
<EOS>
more
than
once
I
suspect
that
the
two
foreigner
be
swindler
,
who
intend
to
"
do
"
the
Englishman
out
of
his
money
.
<EOS>
this
be
impressed
I
upon
me
the
more
,
because
one
evening
a
german
woman
be
introduce
to
their
newly
-
find
friend
as
Frau
Gessner
,
who
have
just
arrive
from
Wiesbaden
.
 
<EOS>
whether
she
be
really
Gessner
's
wife
I
doubt
.
<EOS>
It
be
curious
that
,
on
keep
observation
that
evening
,
I
find
that
the
lady
do
not
reside
at
Sydenham
,
but
at
a
small
hotel
in
Bloomsbury
,
not
a
stone's
-
throw
from
my
own
room
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
certainly
some
deep
game
in
progress
.
<EOS>
what
could
it
be
?
 
<EOS>
Vera
have
watch
Fowler
on
several
occasion
,
but
beyond
the
fact
that
he
be
an
electrical
engineer
,
occupy
a
responsible
position
with
a
well
-
know
telegraph
construction
company
,
we
could
discover
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
after
nearly
three
week
in
London
,
Dubois
and
Gessner
return
to
Hull
,
where
,
while
live
at
the
Station
Hotel
,
they
spend
each
day
at
their
"
work
.
"
<EOS>
They
engage
no
assistant
,
and
be
bent
apparently
upon
do
everything
by
themselves
.
<EOS>
They
be
join
one
day
by
a
shrivel
-
up
old
man
of
rather
seedy
appearance
,
and
typically
german
.
<EOS>
His
name
be
Busch
,
and
he
live
in
lodging
out
on
the
Beverley
Road
.
<EOS>
He
be
take
to
the
work
,
and
remain
there
all
day
.
 
<EOS>
a
quantity
of
electrical
appliance
be
deliver
from
London
,
and
Dubois
and
Gessner
receive
them
and
unpack
them
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Ray
Raymond
be
down
at
Sheerness
upon
another
matter
--
a
serious
attempt
to
obtain
some
confidential
naval
information
--
therefore
I
remain
in
Hull
anxiously
watch
.
<EOS>
Vera
have
again
offer
her
service
,
but
at
that
moment
she
be
down
at
Sheerness
with
Ray
.
 
<EOS>
day
by
day
old
Busch
go
regularly
to
the
factory
,
and
by
the
appearance
of
the
trio
when
they
come
forth
,
it
be
apparent
that
they
work
very
hard
.
<EOS>
I
be
intensely
inquisitive
,
and
dearly
wish
to
obtain
a
glance
within
the
place
.
<EOS>
but
that
be
quite
out
of
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
Busch
,
it
seem
,
have
live
in
Hull
for
a
considerable
period
.
<EOS>
inquiry
of
his
neighbour
reveal
that
he
be
a
well
-
know
figure
.
<EOS>
He
do
but
little
work
,
prefer
to
take
long
walk
into
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
one
man
tell
me
that
he
have
meet
him
twice
away
near
Spurn
Head
,
at
the
estuary
of
the
Humber
,
and
on
another
occasion
he
have
see
him
wander
aimlessly
along
the
low
-
lie
coast
in
the
vicinity
of
Hornsea
.
<EOS>
in
explanation
of
this
,
it
seem
that
he
have
once
live
for
a
whole
summer
in
Withernsea
,
not
far
from
Spurn
Head
,
and
have
grow
fond
of
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
everybody
look
upon
him
as
a
harmless
old
man
,
a
trifle
eccentric
,
and
a
great
walker
.
 
<EOS>
that
constant
rambling
over
that
low
-
lie
district
of
Holderness
have
arouse
my
suspicion
,
and
I
determine
to
turn
my
attention
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
one
day
the
old
man
do
not
go
to
the
factory
,
but
instead
go
forth
upon
one
of
his
ramble
.
<EOS>
He
take
train
from
Hull
to
Hornsea
,
where
the
railway
end
at
the
sea
,
and
walk
along
the
shore
for
several
mile
;
indeed
until
he
be
three
part
of
the
distance
to
Bridlington
,
when
he
suddenly
halt
near
the
little
village
of
Barmston
,
and
produce
a
neat
pocket
-
camera
take
a
long
series
of
snap
-
shot
of
the
flat
coast
,
where
I
see
there
be
several
place
which
would
afford
an
easy
landing
for
the
invader
.
 
<EOS>
the
truth
be
in
an
instant
plain
.
<EOS>
Old
Busch
be
a
"
fix
-
agent
,
"
who
be
carry
on
the
same
work
along
the
Yorkshire
coast
as
his
ingenious
compatriot
be
do
in
Norfolk
,
Suffolk
,
and
Essex
.
<EOS>
the
remainder
of
that
day
I
keep
a
sharp
eye
upon
him
,
and
witness
him
make
many
note
and
take
many
photograph
of
the
various
farm
and
house
near
the
sea
.
<EOS>
He
note
the
number
of
haystack
in
the
farmyard
--
for
his
report
on
fodder
store
,
no
doubt
--
and
make
certain
note
regard
the
house
,
of
great
use
,
no
doubt
,
when
the
Germans
come
to
billet
their
troop
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
nearly
midnight
that
I
be
back
at
the
hotel
in
Hull
.
<EOS>
then
,
by
judicious
inquiry
of
the
hall
porter
--
who
have
become
my
particular
friend
--
I
ascertain
that
Gessner
have
leave
for
London
by
the
last
train
.
 
<EOS>
Should
I
follow
,
or
should
I
remain
in
Hull
?
 
<EOS>
I
decide
upon
the
latter
course
,
and
retire
to
bed
,
thoroughly
fag
out
.
 
<EOS>
early
next
morning
I
go
round
to
the
telephone
-
exchange
,
rather
than
use
the
instrument
in
the
hotel
,
and
ring
up
Raymond
.
 
<EOS>
to
my
delight
he
answer
my
call
.
<EOS>
He
be
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
him
a
rapid
digest
of
what
I
have
discover
,
and
tell
him
that
the
German
have
return
to
Sydenham
.
 
<EOS>
"
all
right
,
old
chap
,
"
come
his
voice
over
the
wire
.
<EOS>
"
Vera
will
watch
at
this
end
,
while
you
watch
yours
.
<EOS>
if
what
I
guess
be
right
,
they
be
do
something
far
more
serious
than
survey
that
flat
coast
north
of
the
Humber
.
<EOS>
be
careful
not
to
betray
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
trust
me
for
that
,
"
I
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
be
you
go
back
to
Sheerness
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
there
all
day
to
-
day
--
and
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
hope
to
get
one
of
our
friend
the
enemy
arrest
.
<EOS>
that
be
what
I
be
try
for
.
<EOS>
good
-
bye
--
and
good
luck
,
"
<EOS>
and
he
ring
off
.
 
<EOS>
Busch
go
to
the
factory
where
Dubois
be
already
await
him
.
<EOS>
as
I
stand
outside
that
building
of
mystery
I
wonder
what
devilment
be
be
plot
within
.
<EOS>
It
have
not
be
clean
or
paint
,
the
window
be
still
thick
with
soot
,
and
several
of
them
,
which
have
be
break
,
be
board
up
.
<EOS>
the
place
have
certainly
not
be
clean
down
for
year
,
and
no
wonder
they
have
be
suspicious
of
the
stability
of
that
chimney
which
tower
so
high
towards
the
murky
sky
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
sign
whatever
of
activity
within
,
or
of
any
business
about
to
be
carry
on
.
<EOS>
thus
,
day
follow
day
,
Busch
and
Dubois
spend
most
of
their
time
within
those
high
wall
which
hold
their
secret
.
 
<EOS>
one
curious
thing
be
the
number
of
telegram
deliver
there
.
<EOS>
sometimes
they
send
and
receive
as
many
as
fourteen
or
fifteen
in
a
day
.
<EOS>
how
I
long
to
know
with
whom
they
be
in
such
constant
communication
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
,
after
the
third
day
,
the
shoal
of
wire
entirely
cease
.
<EOS>
Busch
and
Dubois
,
instead
of
go
to
the
factory
,
spend
the
day
in
the
country
,
take
train
to
Patrington
and
walk
through
Skeffling
go
out
to
Kilnsea
,
opposite
Great
Grimsby
at
the
entrance
to
the
Humber
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
point
where
I
watch
I
could
see
that
the
old
man
with
considerable
gesticulation
be
stand
upon
the
shore
face
seaward
and
explain
something
to
his
companion
.
 
<EOS>
the
Belgian
apparently
put
many
question
to
him
,
and
have
become
intensely
interested
.
<EOS>
then
presently
his
companion
produce
a
paper
from
his
pocket
--
evidently
a
plan
,
for
he
point
out
something
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
light
their
pipe
,
and
sit
down
upon
a
rock
discuss
something
quietly
.
<EOS>
apparently
Busch
be
make
an
elaborate
explanation
,
now
and
then
point
with
his
finger
seaward
.
 
<EOS>
where
he
point
be
the
channel
through
which
pass
all
the
shipping
into
the
Humber
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
after
a
time
,
he
rise
from
where
he
sit
,
and
seem
to
be
measure
a
distance
by
take
pace
,
his
companion
walk
at
his
side
over
the
level
expanse
of
sand
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
he
halt
,
point
to
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Dubois
examine
the
shore
at
that
point
with
apparent
curiosity
.
<EOS>
with
what
object
I
could
not
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
They
remain
there
for
fully
an
hour
,
and
the
sun
have
already
set
when
they
return
to
Patrington
,
and
take
the
train
back
to
Hull
.
 
<EOS>
that
old
Busch
be
a
spy
I
have
prove
long
ago
,
but
what
part
Dubois
and
Gessner
be
play
be
not
yet
at
all
clear
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
follow
evening
,
about
ten
o'clock
,
I
see
Dubois
near
the
Dock
office
,
and
on
watch
him
,
follow
him
to
the
factory
,
which
he
enter
with
his
key
.
<EOS>
beyond
the
gate
be
the
small
paved
courtyard
in
which
rise
the
high
chimney
.
<EOS>
within
the
factory
he
light
the
gas
,
for
I
could
see
its
reflection
,
though
from
the
street
I
could
not
get
sight
of
the
low
window
.
 
<EOS>
the
night
be
bright
and
moonlit
,
and
as
I
wait
I
hear
within
the
grinding
of
a
windlass
,
and
see
to
my
surprise
,
a
thin
light
iron
rod
about
six
foot
long
and
place
vertically
rise
slowly
up
the
side
of
the
chimney
stack
,
evidently
be
draw
up
to
a
pulley
at
its
summit
.
 
<EOS>
Dubois
be
hoist
it
to
the
top
,
where
at
last
<EOS>
it
remain
stationary
,
its
end
just
protrude
beneath
the
coping
and
hardly
visible
.
 
<EOS>
scarcely
have
this
be
do
when
Busch
come
along
,
and
I
have
to
exercise
a
quick
movement
to
avoid
detection
.
<EOS>
He
be
admit
by
Dubois
,
and
the
door
be
close
and
lock
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
I
stand
beneath
the
wall
,
try
to
overhear
their
word
.
<EOS>
but
I
could
understand
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
a
dull
,
crackle
noise
break
the
silence
of
the
night
,
as
though
the
sound
be
dull
by
a
padded
room
.
 
<EOS>
again
I
listen
.
<EOS>
then
at
last
the
truth
dawn
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
spy
have
put
in
a
secret
installation
of
wireless
telegraphy
!
 
<EOS>
those
intermittent
sound
be
that
of
the
morse
code
.
<EOS>
They
be
exchange
signal
with
some
other
person
.
 
<EOS>
Gessner
be
absent
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
the
corresponding
station
be
at
that
house
high
upon
Sydenham
Hill
to
the
south
of
London
,
two
hundred
mile
distant
!
 
<EOS>
I
wait
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
listen
to
those
secret
signal
.
<EOS>
then
I
hurry
to
the
telephone
,
and
fortunately
find
Raymond
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
what
I
have
discover
,
and
urge
him
to
take
a
taxi
at
once
down
to
Sydenham
and
ascertain
whether
they
be
receive
signal
there
.
 
<EOS>
this
he
promise
to
do
,
tell
me
he
would
'
phone
me
the
result
to
the
hotel
at
eight
o'clock
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
I
return
to
the
factory
,
and
through
the
long
night
-
hour
listen
to
their
secret
experiment
.
 
<EOS>
at
eight
next
morning
the
telephone
rang
,
and
Ray
briefly
explain
that
Gessner
,
who
have
place
his
apparatus
upon
the
high
flagstaff
in
his
garden
,
have
be
receive
message
all
night
!
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
see
anything
of
Fowler
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
.
<EOS>
but
Hartmann
have
spend
the
night
with
Gessner
,
apparently
watch
his
experiment
.
<EOS>
Could
not
you
manage
to
watch
your
opportunity
and
get
inside
the
factory
somehow
?
<EOS>
I
will
come
north
at
noon
,
and
we
will
see
what
we
can
do
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
five
o'clock
he
step
from
the
London
express
,
and
together
we
walk
down
to
the
Imperial
Hotel
,
to
which
I
have
suddenly
change
my
quarter
,
feel
that
I
have
be
too
long
in
the
close
vicinity
of
the
spy
Dubois
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
seem
that
they
carry
out
their
experiment
at
night
,
"
I
explain
.
"
<EOS>
for
in
the
daytime
the
wireless
apparatus
be
no
longer
in
position
.
<EOS>
I
see
now
why
they
engage
a
builder
to
examine
the
chimney
--
in
order
to
place
a
pulley
with
a
wire
rope
in
position
at
the
top
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
Gessner
and
Dubois
be
expert
electrician
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
member
of
the
Telegraphen
-
Abtheilung
of
the
german
army
,
most
probably
,
"
remark
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
who
be
Fowler
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
victim
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
He
appear
to
be
a
most
respectable
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
in
any
financial
difficulty
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
not
that
I
can
discover
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
but
why
have
they
establish
this
secret
communication
between
Hull
and
London
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
be
just
what
we
have
to
discover
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
laugh
Ray
.
<EOS>
"
but
if
we
be
to
get
a
peep
inside
the
place
it
be
evident
we
can
only
do
so
in
the
daytime
.
<EOS>
at
night
they
be
down
there
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
at
early
morning
,
"
I
suggest
,
"
after
they
have
leave
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
very
well
,
"
he
say
;
"
we
will
watch
them
to
-
night
,
and
get
in
after
they
leave
.
<EOS>
I
have
bring
a
few
necessary
in
my
bag
--
the
set
of
housebreaking
implement
,
"
he
add
,
with
a
grin
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
I
say
,
"
neither
of
us
know
much
about
wireless
telegraphy
.
<EOS>
Could
not
we
get
hold
of
an
operator
from
one
of
the
Wilson
liner
in
dock
,
and
take
him
along
with
us
?
<EOS>
a
sailor
be
always
an
adventurer
.
"
 
<EOS>
Ray
be
strike
with
the
idea
,
and
by
eight
o'clock
that
evening
we
have
enlist
the
service
of
a
smart
young
fellow
,
one
of
the
operator
in
the
Wilson
American
service
,
to
whom
,
in
strict
confidence
,
we
relate
our
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
that
night
prove
an
exciting
one
.
<EOS>
fortunately
for
us
it
be
cloudy
,
with
rain
,
at
interval
.
<EOS>
Murphy
,
the
wireless
operator
,
listen
under
the
wall
declare
that
we
be
not
mistake
.
<EOS>
the
man
be
send
message
in
code
.
 
<EOS>
"
most
probably
,
"
he
say
,
"
they
have
another
station
across
at
Borkum
,
Wilhelmshaven
,
or
somewhere
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
they
be
at
?
"
<EOS>
he
add
,
much
puzzle
.
 
<EOS>
through
those
long
hour
we
watch
anxiously
;
but
just
before
the
dawn
Dubois
and
Busch
lower
their
apparatus
from
the
top
of
the
chimney
,
and
a
few
minute
later
emerge
,
walk
together
towards
the
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
they
be
out
of
sight
we
hold
a
consultation
,
and
it
be
decide
that
,
while
Murphy
and
I
keep
watch
for
the
police
,
Ray
should
use
his
jemmy
upon
the
door
and
break
it
open
.
<EOS>
He
would
admit
us
and
remain
himself
outside
to
give
us
warning
.
 
<EOS>
those
moment
be
breathless
one
.
 
<EOS>
We
part
,
the
wireless
operator
walk
one
way
,
while
I
go
in
the
opposite
direction
.
<EOS>
suddenly
we
hear
the
cracking
of
wood
,
follow
by
a
low
cough
.
 
<EOS>
by
that
,
we
know
all
be
well
.
 
<EOS>
We
hurry
back
,
and
a
few
second
later
be
in
the
courtyard
of
the
disused
factory
.
<EOS>
Ray
have
hand
me
his
jemmy
,
and
with
it
I
break
open
the
second
door
of
the
empty
place
,
flash
a
light
with
the
electric
torch
I
carry
.
 
<EOS>
We
pass
into
the
small
office
,
but
no
second
glance
be
need
to
show
that
the
place
be
completely
fit
with
a
wireless
installation
of
the
most
approve
pattern
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
will
try
it
,
"
suggest
young
Murphy
,
and
take
out
the
apparatus
we
haul
it
up
to
the
top
of
the
chimney
.
<EOS>
then
re
-
enter
the
office
,
he
place
the
receiver
over
his
ear
,
and
listen
intently
,
in
his
hand
a
pencil
he
have
find
ready
upon
the
paper
pad
.
 
<EOS>
I
stand
watch
his
face
.
<EOS>
apparently
he
hear
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
touch
the
key
of
the
instrument
and
instantly
a
great
blue
spark
,
cause
a
crackle
noise
,
flash
across
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
call
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
his
face
brighten
,
and
he
be
listen
.
<EOS>
then
he
grow
greatly
puzzle
.
 
<EOS>
take
the
receiver
off
his
head
he
begin
to
search
the
table
upon
which
be
several
book
;
but
at
that
instant
I
hear
a
light
footstep
behind
me
,
and
as
I
turn
I
feel
a
heavy
crushing
blow
upon
the
top
of
my
skull
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
blackness
of
unconsciousness
fall
upon
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
no
more
till
,
on
open
my
eye
,
I
find
myself
lie
in
bed
with
a
nurse
bend
over
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
gaze
around
in
amazement
.
<EOS>
there
be
other
bed
in
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
a
hospital
with
my
head
tightly
bandage
.
 
<EOS>
for
a
whole
day
and
night
I
lie
there
,
the
nurse
forbid
me
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
then
suddenly
there
enter
Ray
,
whose
arm
be
in
a
sling
,
accompany
by
young
Murphy
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
spy
come
back
--
unexpectedly
,
and
go
for
me
before
I
could
raise
the
alarm
,
"
Raymond
explain
.
"
<EOS>
Dubois
hit
you
over
the
head
with
a
jemmy
,
and
by
Jove
!
<EOS>
it
be
a
mercy
you
be
not
kill
.
<EOS>
He
be
clear
out
of
the
country
,
however
,
fear
a
charge
of
attempt
murder
.
<EOS>
I
have
inform
the
police
,
and
they
be
look
for
both
him
and
Busch
,
as
well
as
Gessner
,
who
be
miss
from
Sydenham
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
but
why
have
they
establish
these
two
wireless
station
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
reply
Murphy
,
"
it
be
a
most
ingenious
piece
of
work
.
<EOS>
by
some
unknown
mean
both
the
station
here
,
and
at
Sydenham
,
have
be
tune
with
the
one
which
I
daresay
you
have
see
stretch
across
the
top
of
the
new
Admiralty
,
in
Whitehall
,
hence
they
could
read
all
the
order
give
to
the
Home
and
Channel
Fleets
and
the
report
receive
from
them
,
while
I
have
to
-
day
discover
that
there
be
a
similar
secret
station
exist
somewhere
near
Borkum
also
in
tune
with
these
,
and
with
our
Admiralty
.
<EOS>
therefore
the
Germans
be
aware
of
every
signal
send
to
our
Fleet
!
<EOS>
the
station
at
Sydenham
be
only
temporary
,
but
the
one
here
be
evidently
devise
in
order
that
the
german
admiral
in
the
North
Sea
,
on
seize
Hull
and
establish
a
base
here
,
may
have
constant
knowledge
of
our
Admiralty
order
and
the
whereabouts
of
our
ship
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
listen
I
be
surprised
at
the
code
,
but
the
truth
be
make
plain
by
the
discovery
of
a
complete
copy
of
the
british
naval
code
lie
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
by
mean
of
this
,
the
spy
could
decipher
all
message
to
and
from
our
ship
.
<EOS>
the
civil
Lord
of
the
Admiralty
and
three
official
have
arrive
in
Hull
,
and
I
have
be
with
them
down
at
the
factory
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
the
chief
wireless
engineer
declare
that
the
secret
of
the
exact
tuning
must
have
be
learn
from
somebody
in
the
office
of
the
constructor
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
both
Ray
and
I
then
remember
the
man
Fowler
,
who
have
,
as
we
afterwards
discover
,
be
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
,
and
have
suddenly
go
abroad
,
a
fact
which
be
sufficiently
instructive
for
our
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
I
be
well
enough
to
leave
the
hospital
,
and
I
guide
the
superintendent
of
the
Hull
police
and
two
detective
to
Busch
's
house
,
where
,
on
search
his
room
,
we
discover
a
volume
of
plan
and
report
of
defence
of
the
Humber
and
its
estuary
,
estimate
of
food
and
fodder
supply
in
the
country
north
of
Hull
,
together
with
a
list
of
the
foreign
pilot
and
their
address
,
as
well
as
an
annotated
chart
of
the
river
,
show
the
position
where
mine
would
be
sink
at
the
river
's
mouth
on
the
alarm
of
invasion
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
,
perhaps
,
would
have
be
even
more
alarming
to
the
general
public
,
have
they
but
know
,
be
the
discovery
of
several
great
bundle
of
huge
poster
ready
prepare
for
post
up
on
the
day
of
invasion
--
the
Proclamation
threaten
with
death
all
who
dare
to
oppose
the
german
landing
and
advance
--
a
copy
of
which
I
have
give
in
these
page
.
 
<EOS>
It
show
,
indeed
,
what
careful
preparation
our
enemy
be
now
make
,
just
as
the
installation
of
the
secret
wireless
show
the
tactful
cunning
of
the
invader
.
 
<EOS>
for
our
exertion
,
Raymond
,
Murphy
,
and
myself
receive
the
good
thank
of
the
Lords
of
the
Admiralty
,
at
which
,
I
confess
,
we
be
all
three
much
gratify
.

CHAPTER
XIV
 
play
a
desperate
game
  
<EOS>
on
the
20th
of
December
,
1908
,
it
rain
incessantly
in
London
,
and
well
I
recollect
it
.
<EOS>
after
lunch
I
sit
in
the
club
-
window
in
St.
James
's
Street
,
idly
watch
the
drench
passer
-
by
,
many
of
them
people
who
be
up
from
the
country
to
do
their
Christmas
shopping
.
 
<EOS>
the
outlook
be
a
gloomy
one
;
particularly
so
for
myself
,
for
I
have
arrange
to
spend
Christmas
with
an
aunt
who
have
a
pretty
villa
among
the
olive
outside
Nice
,
but
that
morning
I
have
receive
a
telegram
from
her
say
that
she
be
very
unwell
and
ask
me
to
postpone
my
visit
.
 
<EOS>
the
club
be
practically
desert
save
for
one
or
two
old
crony
.
<EOS>
every
one
have
go
to
country
house
,
Ray
be
spend
Christmas
with
Vera
's
father
at
Portsmouth
,
and
in
view
of
the
message
I
have
receive
I
feel
dull
and
alone
.
<EOS>
It
be
astonish
how
very
lonely
a
man
may
be
at
Christmas
in
our
great
London
,
even
though
at
other
time
he
may
possess
host
of
friend
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
receive
fully
a
dozen
invitation
to
country
house
,
all
of
which
I
have
decline
,
and
be
now
,
alas
!
<EOS>
strand
,
without
hope
of
spend
"
a
Merry
Christmas
,
"
except
in
the
lonely
silence
of
my
own
bachelor
chamber
.
<EOS>
so
I
smoke
on
,
look
forth
into
the
darkening
gloom
.
 
<EOS>
the
waiter
switch
on
the
light
in
the
great
smoking
-
room
at
last
,
and
then
draw
the
heavy
curtain
at
all
the
long
window
,
shut
out
the
dismal
scene
.
 
<EOS>
a
man
I
know
,
a
hard
-
work
member
of
Parliament
,
enter
,
throw
himself
down
wearily
and
light
a
cigar
.
<EOS>
then
,
idler
that
I
be
,
I
begin
to
gossip
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
go
up
to
Perthshire
by
the
11.45
from
Euston
that
night
,
he
remark
.
 
<EOS>
"
where
be
you
spend
Christmas
?
<EOS>
"
he
ask
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
know
,
"
I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
probably
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
have
the
hump
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
he
remark
,
with
a
laugh
,
and
then
I
confide
to
him
the
reason
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
about
six
o'clock
,
I
put
on
my
overcoat
and
leave
the
club
.
<EOS>
the
rain
have
now
stop
,
therefore
I
decide
to
walk
along
to
my
room
in
Guilford
Street
.
 
<EOS>
hardly
have
I
turn
the
corner
into
Piccadilly
,
when
I
hear
a
voice
at
my
elbow
utter
my
name
with
a
foreign
accent
.
 
<EOS>
turn
quickly
,
I
see
,
to
my
great
surprise
,
a
man
name
Engler
,
whom
I
have
know
in
Bremen
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
clerk
in
the
Deutsche
Bank
,
opposite
the
Liebfrauen
-
Kirche
,
and
popular
in
a
certain
circle
in
that
hanseatic
city
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Meester
Jacox
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
exclaim
in
broken
English
in
his
enthusiastic
way
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
frendt
.
<EOS>
well
,
well
!
who
would
have
think
of
meet
you
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
ve
-
ry
glad
!
"
<EOS>
he
cry
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
be
in
London
since
three
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
shake
my
friend
's
hand
warmly
,
for
a
year
ago
,
when
I
have
spend
some
time
beside
the
Weser
watch
two
man
I
have
follow
from
London
,
we
have
be
extremely
friendly
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
that
I
be
on
my
way
to
my
room
,
and
invite
him
in
to
have
a
chat
.
 
<EOS>
He
gladly
accompany
me
,
and
when
we
be
comfortably
seat
in
my
cosy
sitting
-
room
he
begin
to
relate
to
me
all
the
late
news
from
Bremen
and
of
several
of
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Otto
Engler
be
a
well
-
dress
,
rather
elegant
man
of
forty
,
whose
fair
beard
be
well
trim
,
whose
eye
be
full
of
fire
,
and
who
rather
pride
himself
upon
be
something
of
a
lady
-
killer
.
<EOS>
He
be
in
London
in
connection
with
an
important
financial
scheme
in
which
his
brother
and
a
german
merchant
in
London
,
name
Griesbach
,
be
interested
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
brother
Wilhelm
be
over
on
a
visit
to
the
merchant
,
who
,
he
tell
me
,
have
office
in
Coleman
Street
,
and
who
live
in
Lonsdale
Road
,
Barnes
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
fortune
in
the
business
,
he
declare
,
which
be
the
discovery
of
a
new
alloy
,
light
than
aluminium
,
yet
with
twenty
time
the
rigidity
.
 
<EOS>
that
evening
we
dine
together
at
the
"
Trocadero
,
"
look
in
at
the
Empire
,
and
return
to
the
club
for
a
smoke
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
be
delighted
to
have
find
an
old
friend
just
when
I
be
in
deep
despair
of
the
dullness
of
everything
,
and
of
Christmas
in
particular
.
 
<EOS>
Otto
Engler
have
one
failing
--
his
impudent
inquisitiveness
.
<EOS>
after
he
have
leave
me
it
occur
to
me
that
all
the
time
we
have
be
together
he
have
be
constantly
endeavour
to
discover
my
recent
movement
,
where
I
have
visit
of
late
,
where
I
intend
spend
Christmas
,
and
my
subsequent
movement
.
 
<EOS>
why
do
he
desire
to
know
all
these
particular
?
<EOS>
He
be
a
busybody
,
I
know
,
and
the
bad
gossip
in
the
whole
of
that
gossip
-
love
city
on
the
Weser
.
<EOS>
therefore
I
attribute
his
inquisitiveness
to
his
natural
propensity
for
pry
into
other
people
's
affair
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
my
dear
friend
,
"
he
have
say
as
he
grip
my
hand
on
leave
me
,
"
they
often
speak
of
you
in
Bremen
.
<EOS>
how
we
all
wish
you
be
back
again
with
us
of
an
evening
at
the
Wiener
Cafe
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
I
shall
never
go
back
,
"
I
say
briefly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
business
nowadays
keep
me
in
London
,
as
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
--
I
know
,
"
he
reply
.
<EOS>
"
remember
,
you
have
always
have
a
true
friend
in
Otto
Engler
--
and
you
always
will
,
I
trust
.
"
 
<EOS>
then
he
have
enter
the
taxi
which
the
hall
-
porter
have
call
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
next
afternoon
he
call
upon
me
at
New
Stone
Buildings
,
as
we
have
arrange
.
<EOS>
Ray
Raymond
be
seat
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
introduce
him
,
and
we
spend
a
pleasant
hour
,
chatting
and
smoking
.
<EOS>
Ray
have
also
be
in
Bremen
,
and
the
two
man
have
,
they
find
,
many
mutual
friend
.
<EOS>
then
,
when
he
have
leave
,
Ray
declare
himself
charm
by
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
so
different
to
the
usual
German
,
"
he
declare
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
nothing
of
the
popinjay
about
him
,
nothing
of
the
modern
military
fop
of
Berlin
or
Dresden
,
man
who
be
,
in
my
estimation
,
the
very
acme
of
bad
breeding
and
degenerate
idiocy
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
Engler
be
quite
a
good
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
be
glad
he
be
find
me
.
<EOS>
I
expect
to
be
deadly
dull
this
Christmas
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
so
do
I
,
"
reply
my
friend
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
get
a
wire
this
morning
from
the
Admiral
say
he
be
down
with
influenza
,
and
the
Christmas
house
-
party
be
postpone
.
<EOS>
so
I
shall
stay
in
town
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
in
that
case
we
may
spend
Christmas
day
together
,
"
I
suggest
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
arrange
.
 
<EOS>
My
german
friend
Otto
see
me
daily
.
<EOS>
I
be
introduce
to
his
brother
,
Wilhelm
,
a
tall
,
thin
,
rather
narrow
-
eyed
man
who
,
from
his
atrocious
German
,
I
judge
be
from
Dantzig
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
evening
in
the
Cafe
Royal
that
I
first
see
Wilhelm
,
who
be
seat
play
domino
with
a
rather
stout
,
middle
-
aged
man
in
gold
-
rim
spectacle
,
Heinrich
Griesbach
.
 
<EOS>
both
man
express
delight
at
meet
me
,
and
I
invite
the
trio
to
my
room
for
a
smoke
and
a
gossip
.
 
<EOS>
We
sit
until
nearly
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
Griesbach
have
be
many
year
in
London
,
and
be
apparently
finance
the
scheme
of
the
brother
Engler
,
a
scheme
which
,
on
the
face
of
it
,
seem
a
very
sound
undertaking
.
 
<EOS>
all
three
be
thorough
-
go
cosmopolitan
,
cheery
,
easy
-
go
man
of
the
world
,
who
tell
many
quaint
story
which
cause
my
room
to
ring
with
laughter
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
be
Christmas
Eve
,
and
Griesbach
suddenly
suggest
that
if
I
have
nothing
well
to
do
he
would
be
delighted
if
I
would
join
their
party
at
dinner
on
Christmas
night
at
his
house
over
at
Barnes
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
regret
very
much
,
"
I
say
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
already
arrange
to
dine
with
my
friend
Raymond
,
who
share
chamber
with
me
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
exclaim
Otto
Engler
,
"
I
be
sure
Herr
Griesbach
would
be
very
pleased
if
he
come
also
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
!
"
cry
the
german
merrily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
more
the
merrier
.
<EOS>
We
shall
dine
at
eight
,
and
we
will
expect
you
both
.
<EOS>
I
will
send
a
note
to
Mr.
Raymond
,
if
you
will
give
me
his
address
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
give
it
to
him
,
and
nothing
loath
to
spend
the
festival
in
such
jovial
company
,
I
accept
.
 
<EOS>
I
entertain
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
by
their
hospitality
they
wish
to
enlist
my
aid
,
because
I
have
one
or
two
friend
in
the
City
who
may
,
perhaps
,
assist
them
materially
in
their
scheme
.
<EOS>
and
yet
,
after
all
,
Otto
Engler
have
often
be
my
guest
in
Bremen
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
I
hear
on
the
telephone
from
Ray
that
he
would
go
down
to
Barnes
with
me
,
and
would
call
for
me
at
six
at
Guilford
Street
.
<EOS>
curiously
enough
,
I
have
become
so
impressed
by
the
possibility
of
the
new
alloy
about
to
be
exploit
with
british
capital
,
that
I
have
really
become
anxious
to
"
go
in
"
with
them
.
<EOS>
Ray
Raymond
,
too
,
be
much
interested
when
I
show
him
the
speciman
of
the
new
metal
which
Engler
have
give
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
,
"
say
he
when
he
call
for
me
at
six
o'clock
on
Christmas
evening
,
"
I
be
about
town
a
lot
yesterday
<EOS>
and
I
be
quite
certain
that
I
be
follow
by
a
foreigner
--
a
rather
big
man
wear
gold
spectacle
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
nonsense
!
"
<EOS>
I
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
why
should
you
be
follow
by
any
foreigner
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
nonsense
,
my
dear
Jacox
,
"
he
declare
.
<EOS>
"
the
fellow
keep
close
observation
on
me
all
yesterday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
when
I
get
back
to
Bruton
Street
,
I
look
out
half
an
hour
afterwards
and
there
he
be
,
still
idle
outside
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
some
chap
who
want
to
serve
you
with
a
writ
,
perhaps
!
<EOS>
"
I
laugh
grimly
.
"
<EOS>
a
neglect
tailor
's
bill
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
He
be
watch
with
some
evil
intent
,
I
be
certain
.
<EOS>
I
expect
he
be
somewhere
near
,
even
now
,
"
he
add
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
!
<EOS>
"
I
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
You
seem
quite
nervy
over
it
!
<EOS>
next
time
you
see
him
,
go
up
to
the
Johnnie
and
ask
him
what
the
dickens
he
want
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
then
,
half
an
hour
later
,
I
put
on
my
hat
and
coat
,
and
together
we
take
a
taxi
past
Kensington
Church
and
Olympia
,
to
Hammersmith
Bridge
,
over
which
we
turn
off
to
the
right
in
Castelnau
,
into
a
long
ill
-
light
thoroughfare
,
run
parallel
with
the
river
.
<EOS>
bare
tree
line
the
road
,
and
each
house
be
a
good
-
sized
one
,
stand
in
its
own
ground
.
 
<EOS>
before
one
of
these
,
hide
from
the
road
by
a
high
wall
,
and
stand
back
a
good
distance
from
the
road
,
the
cab
pull
up
,
and
,
alighting
,
we
open
the
gate
,
and
pass
up
a
well
-
keep
drive
pull
the
bell
.
 
<EOS>
Our
summon
be
answer
by
a
thin
,
rather
consumptive
-
look
german
man
-
servant
,
who
take
our
coat
and
ceremoniously
usher
us
into
a
big
well
-
furnish
drawing
-
room
,
where
Griesbach
and
his
two
friend
be
already
assemble
await
us
.
<EOS>
all
be
smoking
cigarette
,
which
show
that
no
lady
be
to
be
present
.
 
<EOS>
the
instant
Ray
enter
the
room
I
see
that
he
give
a
start
,
and
a
few
moment
later
he
seize
an
opportunity
to
whisper
to
me
that
the
man
who
have
so
persistently
follow
him
on
the
previous
day
be
none
other
than
our
host
Griesbach
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
worry
over
it
,
my
dear
old
fellow
,
"
I
urge
.
<EOS>
"
what
motive
would
he
have
?
<EOS>
He
do
not
even
know
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
then
the
gossip
become
merry
in
that
room
<EOS>
so
seasonably
decorate
with
holly
,
while
Griesbach
assure
us
of
his
delight
in
have
us
as
his
guest
.
 
<EOS>
dinner
be
serve
in
the
adjoining
room
,
and
a
most
excellent
and
thoroughly
English
repast
it
be
.
<EOS>
Our
host
have
be
long
enough
in
England
,
he
tell
us
,
to
appreciate
english
fare
,
hence
we
have
part
of
a
baron
of
beef
with
Christmas
pudding
afterwards
,
and
excellent
old
port
and
nut
to
follow
.
 
<EOS>
two
young
Germans
wait
at
table
,
and
the
party
be
as
merry
a
one
as
any
of
us
could
wish
.
<EOS>
only
Ray
seem
serious
and
preoccupied
.
<EOS>
He
be
suspicious
I
know
--
but
of
what
?
 
<EOS>
I
now
openly
confes
that
I
pretend
a
gaiety
which
I
certainly
do
not
feel
,
for
after
Raymond
have
tell
me
that
he
have
recognise
Griesbach
,
a
very
strange
thought
have
occur
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
this
.
<EOS>
as
we
have
enter
the
garden
to
approach
the
house
,
I
feel
certain
that
I
have
catch
sight
of
the
figure
of
a
man
crouch
against
one
of
the
bush
in
the
shadow
.
<EOS>
at
the
time
I
have
think
nothing
of
it
,
so
eager
be
I
to
meet
my
friend
.
<EOS>
yet
now
,
in
face
of
Ray
's
whisper
word
,
I
grow
very
suspicious
.
<EOS>
why
have
that
man
be
lurk
there
?
 
<EOS>
when
the
cloth
have
be
clear
and
dessert
lay
,
the
elder
of
the
two
servant
place
upon
the
table
before
our
host
a
big
box
of
long
cracker
cover
with
dark
green
gelatine
and
embellish
with
gold
paper
.
 
<EOS>
"
these
be
german
bon
-
bon
,
"
remark
Griesbach
,
his
grey
eye
beam
through
his
spectacle
.
<EOS>
"
I
get
them
each
Christmas
from
my
home
in
Stuttgart
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
conversation
have
again
turn
upon
the
splendid
investment
about
to
be
offer
to
the
british
public
,
<EOS>
whereupon
I
half
suggest
that
I
be
ready
to
go
into
the
affair
myself
.
<EOS>
Griesbach
jump
at
the
idea
,
just
as
I
expect
,
and
hand
round
the
box
of
cracker
.
<EOS>
each
of
us
take
one
,
in
celebration
of
Christmas
,
and
on
their
being
pull
we
discover
small
but
really
acceptable
article
of
masculine
jewellery
within
.
<EOS>
My
"
surprise
"
be
a
pair
of
plain
gold
sleeve
-
link
,
worth
fully
three
or
four
pound
,
while
Ray
,
with
whom
I
pull
,
receive
a
nice
turquoise
scarf
-
pin
,
an
incident
which
quite
reassure
him
.
 
<EOS>
Our
host
refuse
to
take
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
he
declare
,
"
they
be
for
you
,
my
dear
fellow
--
all
for
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
again
the
box
be
pass
round
,
and
four
more
cracker
be
take
.
<EOS>
that
time
Ray
's
bon
-
bon
contain
a
tiny
gold
match
-
box
,
while
within
mine
I
find
a
small
charm
in
the
form
of
a
gold
enamel
doll
to
hang
upon
one
's
watch
-
chain
.
 
<EOS>
as
Ray
and
I
pull
my
cracker
,
I
have
suddenly
raise
my
eye
and
catch
sight
of
the
expression
upon
the
face
of
my
friend
Engler
.
<EOS>
It
strike
me
as
very
curious
.
<EOS>
His
sallow
cheek
be
pale
,
and
his
dark
eye
seem
start
out
of
his
head
with
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
gentleman
,
"
say
our
genial
host
,
after
he
have
pass
the
box
for
the
third
time
,
first
to
his
two
compatriot
,
who
hand
the
remain
two
bon
-
bon
across
the
table
to
us
,
"
you
have
each
a
final
bon
-
bon
.
<EOS>
in
one
of
them
there
will
be
find
a
twenty
-
mark
piece
--
our
german
custom
.
<EOS>
I
suggest
,
in
order
to
mark
this
festive
occasion
,
that
whoever
of
you
four
obtain
<EOS>
the
coin
shall
receive
,
free
of
any
obligation
,
five
share
in
our
new
syndicate
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
a
most
generous
proposal
!
<EOS>
"
declare
my
friend
Engler
,
a
sentiment
with
which
we
all
agree
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
Germans
pull
their
bon
-
bon
,
but
be
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
the
prize
--
certainly
a
prize
worth
win
--
now
lay
between
Ray
and
myself
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
instant
,
however
,
Griesbach
rise
from
the
table
suddenly
,
say
:
 
"
You
two
gentleman
must
settle
between
yourself
.
<EOS>
It
lie
between
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
before
we
be
aware
of
his
intention
he
have
pass
into
the
adjoining
room
,
follow
by
his
two
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
I
laugh
to
Ray
when
we
be
alone
,
"
here
go
.
<EOS>
let
's
decide
it
!
"
<EOS>
and
we
both
grip
the
long
green
-
and
-
gold
cracker
.
<EOS>
if
the
coin
be
within
,
then
I
should
receive
a
very
handsome
present
,
worth
a
little
later
on
,
perhaps
,
several
thousand
pound
.
 
<EOS>
at
that
instant
,
however
,
we
be
both
startle
by
a
loud
smashing
of
glass
in
the
next
room
,
curse
in
german
and
loud
shout
in
English
,
follow
by
the
dull
report
of
a
revolver
.
 
<EOS>
We
both
spring
into
the
room
,
and
there
,
to
our
surprise
,
find
that
six
man
have
enter
through
the
broken
french
window
and
be
struggle
fiercely
with
our
host
and
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
in
the
name
of
Fate
do
this
mean
?
<EOS>
"
I
cry
,
startled
and
amazed
at
that
sudden
termination
to
our
cosy
Christmas
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
"
all
right
,
Mr.
Raymond
,
"
answer
a
big
brown
-
bearded
man
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
me
--
Pelham
of
Scotland
Yard
!
<EOS>
keep
an
eye
on
those
bon
-
bon
in
the
next
room
.
<EOS>
do
not
touch
them
at
peril
of
your
life
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
when
our
host
and
our
two
friend
have
be
secure
--
not
,
however
,
before
the
room
have
be
wreck
in
a
most
desperate
struggle
--
Inspector
Pelham
come
forward
to
where
Ray
be
stand
with
me
,
and
say
:
 
"
<EOS>
My
God
,
Mr.
Raymond
!
<EOS>
You
two
have
have
a
very
narrow
escape
,
and
no
mistake
!
<EOS>
where
be
those
bon
-
bon
?
"
 
<EOS>
We
take
him
into
the
dining
-
room
,
show
him
the
remain
two
,
and
tell
him
we
have
be
about
to
pull
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
.
<EOS>
We
be
watch
you
through
the
window
.
<EOS>
those
man
be
fly
from
the
house
when
they
run
into
our
arm
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
because
they
be
a
dangerous
trio
whom
we
want
on
several
charge
.
<EOS>
in
addition
,
all
three
,
and
also
the
two
servant
,
be
ingenious
spy
in
the
service
of
the
German
General
Staff
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
busy
this
last
two
year
.
<EOS>
They
intend
to
wreak
upon
both
of
you
a
terrible
revenge
for
your
recent
exposure
of
the
german
system
of
espionage
in
England
and
your
constant
prosecution
of
their
spy
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
revenge
!
<EOS>
"
I
gasp
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
revenge
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
reply
the
detective
-
inspector
,
"
both
these
bon
-
bon
contain
powerful
bomb
,
and
have
you
pull
either
of
them
<EOS>
you
would
both
have
be
blow
to
atom
.
<EOS>
that
be
their
dastardly
intention
.
<EOS>
but
fortunately
we
get
wind
of
it
,
and
be
in
time
to
watch
and
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
only
just
in
the
nick
of
time
,
too
!
"
gasp
Ray
,
pale
-
faced
at
thought
of
our
narrow
escape
.
<EOS>
"
I
somehow
feel
all
along
some
vague
presage
that
evil
be
intend
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
three
spy
be
convey
to
Barnes
police
-
station
in
cabs
,
and
that
be
the
last
we
ever
see
of
them
.
<EOS>
the
Government
again
hush
up
the
matter
in
order
to
avoid
international
complication
,
I
suppose
,
but
a
week
later
the
interesting
trio
be
deport
by
the
police
to
Hamburg
as
undesirable
alien
.
 
<EOS>
and
to
-
day
,
with
Ray
Raymond
,
I
be
wonder
what
be
to
be
the
outcome
of
all
this
organise
espionage
in
