HONOURABLE
JOHN
LORD
SOMERS
.
  
<EOS>
My
LORD
,
  
though
the
author
have
write
a
large
dedication
,
yet
that
be
address
to
a
Prince
whom
I
be
never
likely
to
have
the
honour
of
be
know
to
;
a
person
,
besides
,
as
far
as
I
can
observe
,
not
at
all
regard
or
think
on
by
any
of
our
present
writer
;
and
I
be
wholly
free
from
that
slavery
which
bookseller
usually
lie
under
to
the
caprice
of
author
,
I
think
it
a
wise
piece
of
presumption
to
inscribe
these
paper
to
your
lordship
,
and
to
implore
your
lordship
's
protection
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
God
and
your
lordship
know
their
fault
and
their
merit
;
for
as
to
my
own
particular
,
I
be
altogether
a
stranger
to
the
matter
;
and
though
everybody
else
should
be
equally
ignorant
,
I
do
not
fear
the
sale
of
the
book
at
all
the
bad
upon
that
score
.
 
<EOS>
Your
lordship
's
name
on
the
front
in
capital
letter
will
at
any
time
get
off
one
edition
:
 
neither
<EOS>
would
I
desire
any
other
help
to
grow
an
alderman
than
a
patent
for
the
sole
privilege
of
dedicate
to
your
lordship
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
now
,
in
right
of
a
dedicator
,
give
your
lordship
a
list
of
your
own
virtue
,
and
at
the
same
time
be
very
unwilling
to
offend
your
modesty
;
but
chiefly
I
should
celebrate
your
liberality
towards
man
of
great
part
and
small
fortune
,
and
give
you
broad
hint
that
I
mean
myself
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
just
go
on
in
the
usual
method
to
peruse
a
hundred
or
two
of
dedication
,
and
transcribe
an
abstract
to
be
apply
to
your
lordship
,
but
I
be
divert
by
a
certain
accident
.
 
<EOS>
for
upon
the
cover
of
these
paper
I
casually
observe
write
in
large
letter
the
two
follow
word
,
DETUR
DIGNISSIMO
,
which
,
for
aught
I
know
,
may
contain
some
important
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
unluckily
fall
out
that
none
of
the
Authors
I
employ
understand
Latin
(
though
I
have
them
often
in
pay
to
translate
out
of
that
language
)
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
therefore
compel
to
have
recourse
to
the
Curate
of
our
Parish
,
who
englishe
it
thus
,
let
it
be
give
to
the
worthy
;
and
his
comment
be
that
the
author
mean
his
work
should
be
dedicate
to
the
sublime
genius
of
the
age
for
wit
,
learning
,
judgment
,
eloquence
,
and
wisdom
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
at
a
poet
's
chamber
(
who
work
for
my
shop
)
in
an
alley
hard
by
,
show
him
the
translation
,
and
desire
his
opinion
who
it
be
that
the
author
could
mean
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
after
some
consideration
,
that
vanity
be
a
thing
he
abhor
,
but
by
the
description
he
think
himself
to
be
the
person
aim
at
;
and
at
the
same
time
he
very
kindly
offer
his
own
assistance
gratis
towards
pen
a
dedication
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
I
desire
him
,
however
,
to
give
a
second
guess
.
 
<EOS>
why
then
,
say
he
,
it
must
be
I
,
or
my
Lord
Somers
.
 
<EOS>
from
thence
I
go
to
several
other
wit
of
my
acquaintance
,
with
no
small
hazard
and
weariness
to
my
person
,
from
a
prodigious
number
of
dark
winding
stair
;
but
find
them
all
in
the
same
story
,
both
of
your
lordship
and
themselves
.
<EOS>
now
your
lordship
be
to
understand
that
this
proceeding
be
not
of
my
own
invention
;
for
I
have
somewhere
hear
it
be
a
maxim
<EOS>
that
those
to
whom
everybody
allow
the
second
place
have
an
undoubted
title
to
the
first
.
  
<EOS>
this
infallibly
convince
me
that
your
lordship
be
the
person
intend
by
the
author
.
 
<EOS>
but
be
very
unacquainted
in
the
style
and
form
of
dedication
,
I
employ
those
wit
aforesaid
to
furnish
me
with
hint
and
material
towards
a
panegyric
upon
your
lordship
's
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
in
two
day
they
bring
me
ten
sheet
of
paper
fill
up
on
every
side
.
 
<EOS>
They
swear
to
me
that
they
have
ransack
whatever
could
be
find
in
the
character
of
Socrates
,
Aristides
,
Epaminondas
,
Cato
,
Tully
,
Atticus
,
and
other
hard
name
which
I
can
not
now
recollect
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
have
reason
to
believe
they
impose
upon
my
ignorance
,
because
when
I
come
to
read
over
their
collection
,
there
be
not
a
syllable
there
<EOS>
but
what
I
and
everybody
else
know
as
well
as
themselves
:
 
<EOS>
therefore
I
grievously
suspect
a
cheat
;
and
that
these
author
of
mine
steal
and
transcribe
every
word
from
the
universal
report
of
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
so
that
I
take
upon
myself
as
fifty
shilling
out
of
pocket
to
no
manner
of
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
if
by
alter
the
title
I
could
make
the
same
material
serve
for
another
dedication
(
as
my
better
have
do
)
,
it
would
help
to
make
up
my
loss
;
but
I
have
make
several
person
dip
here
and
there
in
those
paper
,
and
before
they
read
three
line
they
have
all
assure
me
plainly
that
they
can
not
possibly
be
apply
to
any
person
besides
your
lordship
.
  
<EOS>
I
expect
,
indeed
,
to
have
hear
of
your
lordship
's
bravery
at
the
head
of
an
army
;
of
your
undaunted
courage
in
mount
a
breach
or
scale
a
wall
;
or
to
have
have
your
pedigree
trace
in
a
lineal
descent
from
the
House
of
Austria
;
or
of
your
wonderful
talent
at
dress
and
dancing
;
or
your
profound
knowledge
in
algebra
,
metaphysic
,
and
the
oriental
tongue
:
 
but
to
ply
the
world
with
an
old
beaten
story
of
your
wit
,
and
eloquence
,
and
learning
,
and
wisdom
,
and
justice
,
and
politeness
,
and
candour
,
and
evenness
of
temper
in
all
scene
of
life
;
of
that
great
discernment
in
discovering
and
readiness
in
favour
deserve
man
;
with
forty
other
common
topic
;
I
confess
I
have
neither
conscience
nor
countenance
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
because
there
be
no
virtue
either
of
a
public
or
private
life
which
some
circumstance
of
your
own
have
not
often
produce
upon
the
stage
of
the
world
;
and
those
few
which
for
want
of
occasion
to
exert
them
may
otherwise
have
pass
unseen
or
unobserved
by
your
friend
,
your
enemy
have
at
length
bring
to
light
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
I
should
be
very
loth
<EOS>
the
bright
example
of
your
lordship
's
virtue
should
be
lose
to
after
-
age
,
both
for
their
sake
and
your
own
;
but
chiefly
because
they
will
be
so
very
necessary
to
adorn
the
history
of
a
late
reign
;
and
that
be
another
reason
why
I
would
forbear
to
make
a
recital
of
them
here
;
because
I
have
be
tell
by
wise
man
that
as
dedication
have
run
for
some
year
past
,
a
good
historian
will
not
be
apt
to
have
recourse
thither
in
search
of
character
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
one
point
wherein
I
think
we
dedicator
would
do
well
to
change
our
measure
;
I
mean
,
instead
of
run
on
so
far
upon
the
praise
of
our
patron
's
liberality
,
to
spend
a
word
or
two
in
admire
their
patience
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
put
no
great
compliment
on
your
lordship
's
than
by
give
you
so
ample
an
occasion
to
exercise
it
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
though
perhaps
I
shall
not
be
apt
to
reckon
much
merit
to
your
lordship
upon
that
score
,
who
have
be
formerly
use
to
tedious
harangue
,
and
sometimes
to
as
little
purpose
,
will
be
the
ready
to
pardon
this
,
especially
when
it
be
offer
by
one
who
be
,
with
all
respect
and
veneration
,
  
<EOS>
My
LORD
,
Your

's
most
obedient
and
most
faithful
servant

the
BOOKSELLER

<EOS>
the
bookseller
to
the
READER
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
six
year
since
these
paper
come
first
to
my
hand
,
which
seem
to
have
be
about
a
twelvemonth
after
they
be
write
,
for
the
author
tell
us
in
his
preface
to
the
first
treatise
that
he
have
calculate
it
for
the
year
1697
;
and
in
several
passage
of
that
discourse
,
as
well
as
the
second
,
it
appear
they
be
write
about
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
the
author
,
I
can
give
no
manner
of
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
be
credibly
inform
that
this
publication
be
without
his
knowledge
,
for
he
conclude
the
copy
be
lose
,
have
lend
it
to
a
person
since
dead
,
and
be
never
in
possession
of
it
after
;
so
that
,
whether
the
work
receive
his
last
hand
,
or
whether
he
intend
to
fill
up
the
defective
place
,
be
like
to
remain
a
secret
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
should
go
about
to
tell
the
reader
by
what
accident
I
become
master
of
these
paper
,
it
would
,
in
this
unbelieving
age
,
pass
for
little
more
than
the
can
not
or
jargon
of
the
trade
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
gladly
spare
both
him
and
myself
so
unnecessary
a
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
there
yet
remain
a
difficult
question
 
why
I
publish
them
no
sooner
?
 
<EOS>
I
forbear
upon
two
account
.
 
<EOS>
first
,
because
I
think
I
have
well
work
upon
my
hand
;
and
secondly
,
because
I
be
not
without
some
hope
of
hear
from
the
author
and
receive
his
direction
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
be
lately
alarm
with
intelligence
of
a
surreptitious
copy
which
a
certain
great
wit
have
new
polish
and
refined
,
or
,
<EOS>
as
our
present
writer
express
themselves
,
"
fit
to
the
humour
of
the
age
,
"
as
they
have
already
do
with
great
felicity
to
Don
Quixote
,
Boccalini
,
La
Bruyere
,
and
other
author
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
think
it
fairer
deal
to
offer
the
whole
work
in
its
natural
.
 
<EOS>
if
any
gentleman
will
please
to
furnish
me
with
a
key
,
in
order
to
explain
the
more
difficult
part
,
I
shall
very
gratefully
acknowledge
the
favour
,
and
print
it
by

the
epistle
DEDICATORY
to
his
royal
highness
<EOS>
prince
POSTERITY
  
<EOS>
SIR
,
  
<EOS>
I
here
present
your
highness
with
the
fruit
of
a
very
few
leisure
hour
,
steal
from
the
short
interval
of
a
world
of
business
,
and
of
an
employment
quite
alien
from
such
amusement
as
this
;
the
poor
production
of
that
refuse
of
time
which
have
lie
heavy
upon
my
hand
during
a
long
prorogation
of
Parliament
,
a
great
dearth
of
foreign
news
,
and
a
tedious
fit
of
rainy
weather
.
 
<EOS>
for
which
,
and
other
reason
,
it
can
not
choose
extremely
to
deserve
such
a
patronage
as
that
of
your
Highness
,
whose
numberless
virtue
in
so
few
year
,
make
the
world
look
upon
you
as
the
future
example
to
all
prince
.
<EOS>
for
although
your
highness
be
hardly
get
clear
of
infancy
,
yet
have
the
universal
learned
world
already
resolve
upon
appeal
to
your
future
dictate
with
the
low
and
most
resign
submission
,
fate
have
decreed
you
sole
arbiter
of
the
production
of
human
wit
in
this
polite
and
most
accomplished
age
.
 
<EOS>
methink
the
number
of
appellant
be
enough
to
shock
and
startle
any
judge
of
a
genius
less
unlimited
than
yours
;
but
in
order
to
prevent
such
glorious
trial
,
the
person
,
it
seem
,
to
whose
care
the
education
of
your
Highness
be
commit
,
have
resolve
,
as
I
be
tell
,
to
keep
you
in
almost
an
universal
ignorance
of
our
study
,
which
it
be
your
inherent
birthright
to
inspect
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
amazing
to
me
that
this
person
should
have
assurance
,
in
the
face
of
the
sun
,
to
go
about
persuade
your
highness
that
our
age
be
almost
wholly
illiterate
and
have
hardly
produce
one
writer
upon
any
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
very
well
that
when
your
Highness
shall
come
to
riper
year
,
and
have
go
through
the
learning
of
antiquity
,
you
will
be
too
curious
to
neglect
inquire
into
the
author
of
the
very
age
before
you
;
and
to
think
that
this
insolent
,
in
the
account
he
be
prepare
for
your
view
,
design
to
reduce
them
to
a
number
so
insignificant
as
I
be
ashamed
to
mention
;
it
move
my
zeal
and
my
spleen
for
the
honour
and
interest
of
our
vast
flourish
body
,
as
well
as
of
myself
,
for
whom
I
know
by
long
experience
he
have
profess
,
and
still
continue
,
a
peculiar
malice
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
unlikely
that
,
when
your
Highness
will
one
day
peruse
what
I
be
now
write
,
you
may
be
ready
to
expostulate
with
your
governor
upon
the
credit
of
what
I
here
affirm
,
and
command
him
to
show
you
some
of
our
production
.
 
<EOS>
to
which
he
will
answer
 
for
I
be
well
informed
of
his
design
 
by
ask
your
Highness
where
they
be
,
and
what
be
become
of
them
?
<EOS>
and
pretend
it
a
demonstration
that
there
never
be
any
,
because
they
be
not
then
to
be
find
.
 
<EOS>
not
to
be
find
!
 
<EOS>
who
have
mislay
them
?
 
<EOS>
be
they
sink
in
the
abyss
of
thing
?
<EOS>
It
be
certain
that
in
their
own
nature
they
be
light
enough
to
swim
upon
the
surface
for
all
eternity
;
therefore
,
the
fault
be
in
him
who
tie
weight
so
heavy
to
their
heel
as
to
depress
them
to
the
centre
.
 
<EOS>
be
their
very
essence
destroy
?
 
<EOS>
who
have
annihilate
them
?
 
<EOS>
be
they
drown
by
purge
or
martyr
by
pipe
?
 
<EOS>
who
administer
them
to
the
posterior
of
#
#
#
#
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
it
may
no
longer
be
a
doubt
with
your
highness
who
be
to
be
the
author
of
this
universal
ruin
<EOS>
,
I
beseech
you
to
observe
that
large
and
terrible
scythe
which
your
governor
affect
to
bear
continually
about
him
.
<EOS>
be
pleased
to
remark
the
length
and
strength
,
the
sharpness
and
hardness
,
of
his
nail
and
tooth
;
consider
his
baneful
,
abominable
breath
,
enemy
to
life
and
matter
,
infectious
and
corrupting
,
and
then
reflect
whether
it
be
possible
for
any
mortal
ink
and
paper
of
this
generation
to
make
a
suitable
resistance
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
that
your
Highness
would
one
day
resolve
to
disarm
this
usurping
maitre
de
palais
of
his
furious
engine
,
and
bring
your
empire
hor
du
page
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
endless
to
recount
the
several
method
of
tyranny
and
destruction
which
your
governor
be
pleased
to
practise
upon
this
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
His
inveterate
malice
be
such
to
the
writing
of
our
age
,
that
,
of
several
thousand
produce
yearly
from
this
renowned
city
,
before
the
next
revolution
of
the
sun
there
be
not
one
to
be
hear
of
.
 
<EOS>
unhappy
infant
!
<EOS>
many
of
them
barbarously
destroy
before
they
have
so
much
as
learn
their
mother
-
tongue
to
beg
for
pity
.
 
<EOS>
some
<EOS>
he
stifle
in
their
cradle
,
other
he
fright
into
convulsion
,
whereof
they
suddenly
die
,
some
<EOS>
he
flay
alive
<EOS>
,
other
he
tear
limb
from
limb
,
great
number
be
offer
to
Moloch
,
and
the
rest
,
taint
by
his
breath
,
die
of
a
languish
consumption
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
concern
I
have
most
at
heart
be
for
our
Corporation
of
Poets
,
from
whom
I
be
prepare
a
petition
to
your
Highness
,
to
be
subscribe
with
the
name
of
one
hundred
and
thirty
-
six
of
the
first
race
,
but
whose
immortal
production
be
never
likely
to
reach
your
eye
,
though
each
of
them
be
now
an
humble
and
an
earnest
appellant
for
the
laurel
,
and
have
large
comely
volume
ready
to
show
for
a
support
to
his
pretension
.
 
<EOS>
the
never
-
die
work
of
these
illustrious
person
your
governor
,
sir
,
have
devote
to
unavoidable
death
,
and
your
highness
be
to
be
make
believe
that
our
age
have
never
arrive
at
the
honour
to
produce
one
single
poet
.
  
<EOS>
We
confess
immortality
to
be
a
great
and
powerful
goddess
,
but
in
vain
we
offer
up
to
her
our
devotion
and
our
sacrifice
if
your
Highness
's
governor
,
who
have
usurp
the
priesthood
,
must
,
by
an
unparalleled
ambition
and
avarice
,
wholly
intercept
and
devour
them
.
  
<EOS>
to
affirm
that
our
age
be
altogether
unlearned
and
devoid
of
writer
in
any
kind
,
seem
to
be
an
assertion
so
bold
and
so
false
,
that
I
have
be
sometimes
think
the
contrary
may
almost
be
prove
by
uncontrollable
demonstration
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
indeed
,
that
although
their
number
be
vast
and
their
production
numerous
in
proportion
,
yet
be
they
hurry
so
hastily
off
the
scene
that
they
escape
our
memory
and
delude
our
sight
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
first
think
of
this
address
,
I
have
prepare
a
copious
list
of
title
to
present
your
Highness
as
an
undisputed
argument
for
what
I
affirm
.
 
<EOS>
the
original
be
post
fresh
upon
all
gate
and
corner
of
street
;
but
return
in
a
very
few
hour
to
take
a
review
,
they
be
all
tear
down
and
fresh
one
in
their
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
inquire
after
them
among
reader
and
bookseller
,
but
I
inquire
in
vain
;
the
memorial
of
them
be
lose
among
man
<EOS>
,
their
place
be
no
more
to
be
find
;
and
I
be
laugh
to
scorn
for
a
clown
and
a
pedant
,
devoid
of
all
taste
and
refinement
,
little
versed
in
the
course
of
present
affair
,
and
that
know
nothing
of
what
have
pass
in
the
good
company
of
court
and
town
.
<EOS>
so
that
I
can
only
avow
in
general
to
your
highness
that
we
do
abound
in
learning
and
wit
,
but
to
fix
upon
particular
be
a
task
too
slippery
for
my
slender
ability
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
should
venture
,
in
a
windy
day
,
to
affirm
to
your
Highness
that
there
be
a
large
cloud
near
the
horizon
in
the
form
of
a
bear
,
another
in
the
zenith
with
the
head
of
an
ass
,
a
third
to
the
westward
with
claws
like
a
dragon
;
and
your
Highness
should
in
a
few
minute
think
fit
to
examine
the
truth
<EOS>
,
it
be
certain
they
would
be
all
chance
in
figure
and
position
,
new
one
would
arise
,
and
all
we
could
agree
upon
would
be
,
that
cloud
there
be
,
but
that
I
be
grossly
mistake
in
the
zoography
and
topography
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
your
governor
,
perhaps
,
may
still
insist
,
and
put
the
question
<EOS>
,
what
be
then
become
of
those
immense
bale
of
paper
which
must
needs
have
be
employ
in
such
number
of
book
?
 
<EOS>
Can
these
also
be
wholly
annihilate
,
and
to
of
a
sudden
,
as
I
pretend
?
 
<EOS>
what
shall
I
say
in
return
of
so
invidious
an
objection
?
 
<EOS>
It
ill
befit
the
distance
between
your
Highness
and
me
to
send
you
for
ocular
conviction
to
a
jake
or
an
oven
,
to
the
window
of
a
bawdyhouse
,
or
to
a
sordid
lanthorn
.
 
<EOS>
book
,
like
man
their
author
,
have
no
more
than
one
way
of
come
into
the
world
,
but
there
be
ten
thousand
to
go
out
of
it
and
return
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
I
profess
to
your
Highness
,
in
the
integrity
of
my
heart
,
that
what
I
be
go
to
say
be
literally
true
<EOS>
this
minute
I
be
write
;
what
revolution
may
happen
before
it
shall
be
ready
for
your
perusal
<EOS>
I
can
by
no
means
warrant
;
however
,
I
beg
you
to
accept
it
as
a
speciman
of
our
learning
,
our
politeness
,
and
our
wit
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
therefore
affirm
,
upon
the
word
of
a
sincere
man
,
that
there
be
now
actually
in
be
a
certain
poet
call
John
Dryden
,
whose
translation
of
Virgil
be
lately
print
in
large
folio
,
well
bind
,
and
if
diligent
search
be
make
,
for
aught
I
know
,
be
yet
to
be
see
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
another
call
Nahum
Tate
,
who
be
ready
to
make
oath
that
he
have
cause
many
ream
of
verse
to
be
publish
,
whereof
both
himself
and
his
bookseller
,
if
lawfully
require
,
can
still
produce
authentic
copy
,
and
therefore
wonder
why
the
world
be
pleased
to
make
such
a
secret
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
third
,
know
by
the
name
of
Tom
Durfey
,
a
poet
of
a
vast
comprehension
,
an
universal
genius
,
and
most
profound
learn
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
also
one
Mr.
Rymer
and
one
Mr.
Dennis
,
most
profound
critic
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
person
style
Dr.
Bentley
,
who
have
write
near
a
thousand
page
of
immense
erudition
,
give
a
full
and
true
account
of
a
certain
squabble
of
wonderful
importance
between
himself
and
a
bookseller
;
he
be
a
writer
of
infinite
wit
and
humour
,
no
man
rally
with
a
well
grace
and
in
more
sprightly
turn
.
 
<EOS>
further
,
I
avow
to
your
Highness
that
with
these
eye
I
have
behold
the
person
of
William
Wotton
,
B.D.
,
who
have
write
a
good
-
sized
volume
against
a
friend
of
your
governor
,
from
whom
,
alas
!
<EOS>
he
must
therefore
look
for
little
favour
,
in
a
most
gentlemanly
style
,
adorn
with
utmost
politeness
and
civility
,
replete
with
discovery
equally
valuable
for
their
novelty
and
use
,
and
embellish
with
trait
of
wit
so
poignant
and
so
apposite
,
that
he
be
a
worthy
yoke
-
mate
to
his
fore
-
mention
friend
.
  
<EOS>
why
should
I
go
upon
farther
particular
,
which
may
fill
a
volume
with
the
just
eulogy
of
my
contemporary
brother
?
 
<EOS>
I
shall
bequeath
this
piece
of
justice
to
a
large
work
<EOS>
,
wherein
I
intend
to
write
a
character
of
the
present
set
of
wit
in
our
nation
;
their
person
I
shall
describe
particularly
and
at
length
,
their
genius
and
understanding
in
miniature
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
I
do
here
make
bold
to
present
your
highness
with
a
faithful
abstract
draw
from
the
universal
body
of
all
art
and
science
,
intend
wholly
for
your
service
and
instruction
.
 
<EOS>
nor
do
I
doubt
in
the
least
<EOS>
but
your
Highness
will
peruse
it
as
carefully
and
make
as
considerable
improvement
as
other
young
prince
have
already
do
by
the
many
volume
of
late
year
write
for
a
help
to
their
study
.
  
<EOS>
that
your
highness
may
advance
in
wisdom
and
virtue
,
as
well
as
year
,
and
at
last
outshine
all
your
royal
ancestor
,
shall
be
the
daily
prayer
of
,
  
SIR
,
Your
Highness
's
most
devoted
,
&
c.
 
Decemb

<EOS>
1697
.
  
<EOS>
the
PREFACE
.
  
<EOS>
the
wit
of
the
present
age
be
so
very
numerous
and
penetrate
,
it
seem
the
grandee
of
Church
and
State
begin
to
fall
under
horrible
apprehension
lest
these
gentleman
,
during
the
interval
of
a
long
peace
,
should
find
leisure
to
pick
hole
in
the
weak
side
of
religion
and
government
.
 
<EOS>
to
prevent
which
,
there
have
be
much
think
employ
of
late
upon
certain
project
for
take
off
the
force
and
edge
of
those
formidable
inquirer
from
canvass
and
reason
upon
such
delicate
point
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
at
length
fix
upon
one
,
which
will
require
some
time
as
well
as
cost
to
perfect
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
danger
hourly
increase
,
by
new
levy
of
wit
,
all
appoint
(
as
there
be
reason
to
fear
)
with
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
which
may
at
an
hour
's
warning
be
draw
out
into
pamphlet
and
other
offensive
weapon
ready
for
immediate
execution
,
it
be
judge
of
absolute
necessity
that
some
present
expedient
be
think
on
till
the
main
design
can
be
bring
to
maturity
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
end
,
at
a
grand
committee
,
some
day
ago
,
this
important
discovery
be
make
by
a
certain
curious
and
refined
observer
,
that
seaman
have
a
custom
when
they
meet
a
Whale
to
fle
him
out
an
empty
tub
,
by
way
of
amusement
,
to
divert
him
from
lay
violent
hand
upon
the
Ship
.
<EOS>
this
parable
be
immediately
mythologise
;
the
Whale
be
interpret
to
be
Hobbes
's
"
Leviathan
,
"
which
toss
and
play
with
all
other
scheme
of
religion
and
government
,
whereof
a
great
many
be
hollow
,
and
dry
,
and
empty
,
and
noisy
,
and
wooden
,
and
give
to
rotation
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
Leviathan
from
whence
<EOS>
the
terrible
wit
of
our
age
be
say
to
borrow
their
weapon
.
 
<EOS>
the
Ship
in
danger
be
easily
understand
to
be
its
old
antitype
the
commonwealth
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
to
analyse
the
Tub
be
a
matter
of
difficulty
,
when
,
after
long
inquiry
and
debate
,
the
literal
meaning
be
preserve
,
and
it
be
decree
that
,
in
order
to
prevent
these
Leviathans
from
toss
and
sport
with
the
commonwealth
,
which
of
itself
be
too
apt
to
fluctuate
,
they
should
be
divert
from
that
game
by
"
a
Tale
of
a
Tub
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
and
my
genius
be
conceive
to
lie
not
unhappily
that
way
<EOS>
,
I
have
the
honour
do
me
to
be
engage
in
the
performance
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
sole
design
in
publish
the
follow
treatise
,
which
I
hope
will
serve
for
an
interim
of
some
month
to
employ
those
unquiet
spirit
till
the
perfecting
of
that
great
work
,
into
the
secret
of
which
it
be
reasonable
the
courteous
reader
should
have
some
little
light
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
intend
that
a
large
Academy
be
erect
,
capable
of
contain
nine
thousand
seven
hundred
forty
and
three
person
,
which
,
by
modest
computation
,
be
reckon
to
be
pretty
near
the
current
number
of
wit
in
this
island
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
to
be
dispose
into
the
several
school
of
this
Academy
,
and
there
pursue
those
study
to
which
their
genius
most
incline
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
undertaker
himself
will
publish
his
proposal
with
all
convenient
speed
,
to
which
I
shall
refer
the
curious
reader
for
a
more
particular
account
,
mention
at
present
only
a
few
of
the
principal
school
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
,
first
,
a
large
pederastic
school
,
with
french
and
italian
master
;
there
be
also
the
spelling
school
,
a
very
spacious
building
;
the
school
of
looking
-
glass
;
the
school
of
swear
;
the
school
of
critic
;
the
school
of
salivation
;
the
school
of
hobby
-
horse
;
the
school
of
poetry
;
the
school
of
top
;
the
school
of
spleen
;
the
school
of
gaming
;
with
many
other
too
tedious
to
recount
.
 
<EOS>
no
person
to
be
admit
member
into
any
of
these
school
without
an
attestation
under
two
sufficient
person
'
hand
certify
him
to
be
a
wit
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sufficiently
instruct
in
the
principal
duty
of
a
preface
if
my
genius
,
be
capable
of
arrive
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
Thrice
<EOS>
have
I
force
my
imagination
to
take
the
tour
of
my
invention
,
and
thrice
<EOS>
it
have
return
empty
,
the
latter
have
be
wholly
drain
by
the
follow
treatise
.
 
<EOS>
not
so
my
more
successful
brother
<EOS>
the
modern
,
who
will
by
no
mean
let
slip
a
preface
or
dedication
without
some
notable
distinguishing
stroke
to
surprise
the
reader
at
the
entry
,
and
kindle
a
wonderful
expectation
of
what
be
to
ensue
.
<EOS>
such
be
that
of
a
most
ingenious
poet
,
who
,
solicit
his
brain
for
something
new
,
compare
himself
to
the
hangman
and
his
patron
to
the
patient
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
insigne
,
recens
,
indictum
ore
alio
.
<EOS>
when
I
go
through
that
necessary
and
noble
course
of
study
,
 
I
have
the
happiness
to
observe
many
such
egregious
touch
,
which
I
shall
not
injure
the
author
by
transplant
,
because
I
have
remark
that
nothing
be
so
very
tender
as
a
modern
piece
of
wit
,
and
which
be
apt
to
suffer
so
much
in
the
carriage
.
 
<EOS>
some
thing
be
extremely
witty
to
-
day
,
or
fasting
,
or
in
this
place
,
or
at
eight
o'clock
,
or
over
a
bottle
,
or
speak
by
Mr.
Whatdyecall'm
,
or
in
a
summer
's
morning
,
any
of
which
,
by
the
small
transposal
or
misapplication
,
be
utterly
annihilate
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
wit
have
its
walk
and
purlieu
,
out
of
which
it
may
not
stray
the
breadth
of
a
hair
,
upon
peril
of
be
lose
.
 
<EOS>
the
modern
have
artfully
fix
this
Mercury
,
and
reduce
it
to
the
circumstance
of
time
,
place
,
and
person
.
<EOS>
such
a
jest
there
be
that
will
not
pass
out
of
Covent
Garden
,
and
such
a
one
that
be
nowhere
intelligible
but
at
Hyde
Park
Corner
.
<EOS>
now
,
though
it
sometimes
tenderly
affect
me
to
consider
that
all
the
towardly
passage
I
shall
deliver
in
the
follow
treatise
will
grow
quite
out
of
date
and
relish
with
the
first
shifting
of
the
present
scene
,
yet
I
must
need
subscribe
to
the
justice
of
this
proceeding
,
because
I
can
not
imagine
why
we
should
be
at
expense
to
furnish
wit
for
succeed
age
,
when
the
former
have
make
no
sort
of
provision
for
our
;
wherein
I
speak
the
sentiment
of
the
very
new
,
and
consequently
the
most
orthodox
refiner
,
as
well
as
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
be
extremely
solicitous
that
every
accomplished
person
who
have
get
into
the
taste
of
wit
calculate
for
this
present
month
of
August
1697
should
descend
to
the
very
bottom
of
all
the
sublime
throughout
this
treatise
,
I
hold
it
fit
to
lay
down
this
general
maxim
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
reader
desire
to
have
a
thorough
comprehension
of
an
author
's
thought
,
can
not
take
a
well
method
than
by
put
himself
into
the
circumstance
and
posture
of
life
that
the
writer
be
in
upon
every
important
passage
as
it
flow
from
his
pen
,
for
this
will
introduce
a
parity
and
strict
correspondence
of
idea
between
the
reader
and
the
author
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
to
assist
the
diligent
reader
in
so
delicate
an
affair
 
as
far
as
brevity
will
permit
 
I
have
recollect
that
the
shrewd
piece
of
this
treatise
be
conceive
in
bed
in
a
garret
.
 
<EOS>
at
other
time
(
for
a
reason
best
know
to
myself
)
I
think
fit
to
sharpen
my
invention
with
hunger
,
and
in
general
the
whole
work
be
begin
,
continue
,
and
end
under
a
long
course
of
physic
and
a
great
want
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
I
do
affirm
it
will
be
absolutely
impossible
for
the
candid
peruser
to
go
along
with
me
in
a
great
many
bright
passage
,
unless
upon
the
several
difficulty
emergent
he
will
please
to
capacitate
and
prepare
himself
by
these
direction
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
I
lie
down
as
my
principal
postulatum
.
  
<EOS>
because
I
have
profess
to
be
a
most
devoted
servant
of
all
modern
form
,
I
apprehend
some
curious
wit
may
object
against
me
for
proceed
thus
far
in
a
preface
without
declaim
,
accord
to
custom
,
against
the
multitude
of
writer
<EOS>
whereof
the
whole
multitude
of
writer
most
reasonably
complain
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
just
come
from
peruse
some
hundred
of
preface
,
wherein
the
author
do
at
the
very
beginning
address
the
gentle
reader
concern
this
enormous
grievance
.
 
<EOS>
of
these
I
have
preserve
a
few
example
,
and
shall
set
them
down
as
near
as
my
memory
have
be
able
to
retain
them
.
  
<EOS>
one
begin
thus
:
 
"
for
a
man
to
set
up
for
a
writer
when
the
press
swarm
with
,
"
&
c.
  
another
:
 
"
the
tax
upon
paper
do
not
lessen
the
number
of
scribbler
who
daily
pester
,
"
&
c.
  
<EOS>
another
:
 
<EOS>
"
when
every
little
would
-
be
wit
take
pen
in
hand
,
'
tis
in
vain
to
enter
the
list
,
"
&
c.
  
another
:
 
"
to
observe
what
trash
the
press
swarm
with
,
"
&
c.
  
another
:
 
"
Sir
,
it
be
merely
in
obedience
to
your
command
that
I
venture
into
the
public
,
for
who
upon
a
less
consideration
would
be
of
a
party
with
such
a
rabble
of
scribbler
,
"
&
c.
  
<EOS>
now
,
I
have
two
word
in
my
own
defence
against
this
objection
.
<EOS>
first
,
I
be
far
from
grant
the
number
of
writer
a
nuisance
to
our
nation
,
have
strenuously
maintain
the
contrary
in
several
part
of
the
follow
discourse
;
secondly
,
I
do
not
well
understand
the
justice
of
this
proceeding
,
because
I
observe
many
of
these
polite
preface
to
be
not
only
from
the
same
hand
,
but
from
those
who
be
most
voluminous
in
their
several
production
;
upon
which
I
shall
tell
the
reader
a
short
tale
.
  
<EOS>
a
mountebank
in
Leicester
Fields
have
draw
a
huge
assembly
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
among
the
rest
,
a
fat
unwieldy
fellow
,
half
stifle
in
the
press
,
would
be
every
fit
cry
out
,
"
Lord
!
<EOS>
what
a
filthy
crowd
be
here
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
good
people
,
give
way
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
need
what
a
devil
have
rake
this
rabble
together
.
 
<EOS>
Z####ds
,
what
squeezing
be
this
?
 
<EOS>
honest
friend
,
remove
your
elbow
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
last
a
weaver
that
stand
next
him
could
hold
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
plague
confound
you
,
"
say
he
,
"
for
an
overgrown
sloven
;
and
who
in
the
devil
's
name
,
I
wonder
,
help
to
make
up
the
crowd
half
so
much
as
yourself
?
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
consider
that
you
take
up
more
room
with
that
carcass
than
any
five
here
?
 
<EOS>
be
not
the
place
as
free
for
us
as
for
you
?
 
<EOS>
bring
your
own
gut
to
a
reasonable
compass
,
and
then
I
will
engage
we
shall
have
room
enough
for
us
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
certain
common
privilege
of
a
writer
<EOS>
,
the
benefit
whereof
<EOS>
I
hope
there
will
be
no
reason
to
doubt
;
particularly
,
that
where
I
be
not
understand
,
it
shall
be
conclude
that
something
very
useful
and
profound
be
couch
underneath
;
and
again
,
that
whatever
word
or
sentence
be
print
in
a
different
character
shall
be
judge
to
contain
something
extraordinary
either
of
wit
or
sublime
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
the
liberty
I
have
think
fit
to
take
of
praise
myself
,
upon
some
occasion
or
none
,
I
be
sure
it
will
need
no
excuse
if
a
multitude
of
great
example
be
allow
sufficient
authority
;
for
it
be
here
to
be
note
that
praise
be
originally
a
pension
pay
by
the
world
,
but
the
modern
,
find
the
trouble
and
charge
too
great
in
collect
it
,
have
lately
buy
out
the
fee
-
simple
,
since
which
time
the
right
of
presentation
be
wholly
in
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
reason
it
be
that
when
an
author
make
his
own
eulogy
,
he
use
a
certain
form
to
declare
and
insist
upon
his
title
,
which
be
commonly
in
these
or
the
like
word
,
"
I
speak
without
vanity
,
"
which
I
think
plainly
show
it
to
be
a
matter
of
right
and
justice
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
I
do
here
once
for
all
declare
,
that
in
every
encounter
of
this
nature
through
the
follow
treatise
the
form
aforesaid
be
imply
,
which
I
mention
to
save
the
trouble
of
repeat
it
on
so
many
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
ease
to
my
conscience
that
I
have
write
so
elaborate
and
useful
a
discourse
without
one
grain
of
satire
intermix
,
which
be
the
sole
point
wherein
I
have
take
leave
to
dissent
from
the
famous
original
of
our
age
and
country
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
observe
some
satirist
to
use
the
public
much
at
the
rate
that
pedant
do
a
naughty
boy
ready
horse
for
discipline
.
 
<EOS>
first
expostulate
the
case
,
then
plead
the
necessity
of
the
rod
from
great
provocation
,
and
conclude
every
period
with
a
lash
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
if
I
know
anything
of
mankind
,
these
gentleman
may
very
well
spare
their
reproof
and
correction
,
for
there
be
not
through
all
nature
another
so
callous
and
insensible
a
member
as
the
world
's
posterior
,
whether
you
apply
to
it
the
toe
or
the
birch
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
most
of
our
late
satirist
seem
to
lie
under
a
sort
of
mistake
,
that
because
nettle
have
the
prerogative
to
ste
,
therefore
all
other
weed
must
do
so
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
not
this
comparison
out
of
the
least
design
to
detract
from
these
worthy
writer
,
for
it
be
well
know
among
mythologist
that
weed
have
the
pre
-
eminence
over
all
other
vegetable
;
and
therefore
the
first
monarch
of
this
island
whose
taste
and
judgment
be
so
acute
and
refined
,
do
very
wisely
root
out
the
rose
from
the
collar
of
the
order
and
plant
the
thistle
in
their
stead
,
as
the
noble
flower
of
the
two
.
 
<EOS>
for
which
reason
it
be
conjecture
by
profounder
antiquary
that
the
satirical
itch
,
so
prevalent
in
this
part
of
our
island
,
be
first
bring
among
us
from
beyond
the
Tweed
.
 
<EOS>
here
may
it
long
flourish
and
abound
;
may
it
survive
and
neglect
the
scorn
of
the
world
with
as
much
ease
and
contempt
as
the
world
be
insensible
to
the
lash
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
May
their
own
dulness
,
or
that
of
their
party
,
be
no
discouragement
for
the
author
to
proceed
;
but
let
them
remember
it
be
with
wit
as
with
razor
,
which
be
never
so
apt
to
cut
those
they
be
employ
on
as
when
they
have
lose
their
edge
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
those
whose
tooth
be
too
rotten
to
bite
be
good
of
all
other
qualify
to
revenge
that
defect
with
their
breath
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
,
like
other
man
,
to
envy
or
undervalue
the
talent
I
can
not
reach
,
for
which
reason
I
must
needs
bear
a
true
honour
to
this
large
eminent
sect
of
our
british
writer
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
hope
this
little
panegyric
will
not
be
offensive
to
their
ear
,
since
it
have
the
advantage
of
be
only
design
for
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
Nature
herself
have
take
order
that
fame
and
honour
should
be
purchase
at
a
well
pennyworth
by
satire
than
by
any
other
production
of
the
brain
,
the
world
be
soonest
provoke
to
praise
by
lash
,
as
man
be
to
love
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
problem
in
an
ancient
author
why
dedication
and
other
bundle
of
flattery
run
all
upon
stale
musty
topic
,
without
the
small
tincture
of
anything
new
,
not
only
to
the
torment
and
nauseating
of
the
christian
reader
,
but
,
if
not
suddenly
prevent
,
to
the
universal
spreading
of
that
pestilent
disease
the
lethargy
in
this
island
,
whereas
there
be
very
little
satire
which
have
not
something
in
it
untouche
before
.
 
<EOS>
the
defect
of
the
former
be
usually
impute
to
the
want
of
invention
among
those
who
be
dealer
in
that
kind
;
but
I
think
with
a
great
deal
of
injustice
,
the
solution
be
easy
and
natural
,
for
the
material
of
panegyric
,
be
very
few
in
number
,
have
be
long
since
exhaust
;
for
as
health
be
but
one
thing
,
and
have
be
always
the
same
,
whereas
disease
be
by
thousand
,
besides
new
and
daily
addition
,
so
all
the
virtue
that
have
be
ever
in
mankind
be
to
be
count
upon
a
few
finger
,
but
his
folly
and
vice
be
innumerable
,
and
time
add
hourly
to
the
heap
.
 
<EOS>
now
the
utmost
a
poor
poet
can
do
be
to
get
by
heart
a
list
of
the
cardinal
virtue
and
deal
them
with
his
utmost
liberality
to
his
hero
or
his
patron
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
ring
the
change
as
far
as
it
will
go
,
and
vary
his
phrase
till
he
have
talk
round
,
but
the
reader
quickly
find
it
be
all
pork
,
 
with
a
little
variety
of
sauce
,
for
there
be
no
invent
term
of
art
beyond
our
idea
,
and
when
idea
be
exhaust
,
term
of
art
must
be
so
too
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
the
matter
for
panegyric
be
as
fruitful
as
the
topic
of
satire
,
yet
would
it
not
be
hard
to
find
out
a
sufficient
reason
why
the
latter
will
be
always
better
receive
than
the
first
;
for
this
be
bestow
only
upon
one
or
a
few
person
at
a
time
,
be
sure
to
raise
envy
,
and
consequently
ill
word
,
from
the
rest
who
have
no
share
in
the
blessing
.
 
<EOS>
but
satire
,
be
level
at
all
,
be
never
resent
for
an
offence
by
any
,
since
every
individual
person
make
bold
to
understand
it
of
other
,
and
very
wisely
remove
his
particular
part
of
the
burden
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
World
,
which
be
broad
enough
and
able
to
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
purpose
I
have
sometimes
reflect
upon
the
difference
between
Athens
and
England
with
respect
to
the
point
before
us
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
attic
 
commonwealth
it
be
the
privilege
and
birthright
of
every
citizen
and
poet
to
rail
aloud
and
in
public
,
or
to
expose
upon
the
stage
by
name
any
person
they
please
,
though
of
the
great
figure
,
whether
a
Creon
,
an
Hyperbolus
,
an
Alcibiades
,
or
a
Demosthenes
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
on
the
other
side
,
the
least
reflect
word
let
fall
against
the
people
in
general
be
immediately
catch
up
and
revenge
upon
the
author
,
however
considerable
for
their
quality
or
their
merit
;
whereas
in
England
it
be
just
the
reverse
of
all
this
.
 
<EOS>
here
you
may
securely
display
your
utmost
rhetoric
against
mankind
in
the
face
of
the
world
;
tell
them
that
all
be
go
astray
;
that
there
be
none
that
doeth
good
,
no
,
not
one
;
that
we
live
in
the
very
dreg
of
time
;
that
knavery
and
atheism
be
epidemic
as
the
pox
;
that
honesty
be
flee
with
Astraea
;
with
any
other
common
-
place
equally
new
and
eloquent
,
which
be
furnish
by
the
splendida
bill
;
and
when
you
have
do
,
the
whole
audience
,
far
from
be
offend
,
shall
return
you
thank
as
a
deliverer
of
precious
and
useful
truth
.
<EOS>
nay
,
further
,
it
be
but
to
venture
your
lung
,
and
you
may
preach
in
Covent
Garden
against
foppery
and
fornication
,
and
something
else
;
against
pride
,
and
dissimulation
,
and
bribery
at
Whitehall
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
expose
rapine
and
injustice
in
the
Inns
-
of
-
Court
chapel
,
and
in
a
city
pulpit
be
as
fierce
as
you
please
against
avarice
,
hypocrisy
,
and
extortion
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
but
a
ball
bandy
to
and
fro
,
and
<EOS>
every
man
carry
a
racket
about
him
to
strike
it
from
himself
among
the
rest
of
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
on
the
other
side
,
whoever
should
mistake
the
nature
of
thing
so
far
as
to
drop
but
<EOS>
a
single
hint
in
public
how
such
a
one
starve
half
the
fleet
,
and
half
poison
the
rest
;
how
such
a
one
,
from
a
true
principle
of
love
and
honour
,
pay
no
debt
but
for
wench
and
play
;
how
such
a
one
run
out
of
his
estate
;
how
Paris
,
bribe
by
Juno
and
Venus
,
loath
to
offend
either
party
,
sleep
out
the
whole
cause
on
the
bench
;
or
how
such
an
orator
make
long
speech
in
the
Senate
,
with
much
thought
,
little
sense
,
and
to
no
purpose
;
 
whoever
,
I
say
,
should
venture
to
be
thus
particular
,
must
expect
to
be
imprison
for
scandalum
magnatum
,
to
have
challenge
send
him
,
to
be
sue
for
defamation
,
and
to
be
bring
before
the
bar
of
the
House
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
forget
that
I
be
expatiate
on
a
subject
<EOS>
wherein
I
have
no
concern
,
have
neither
a
talent
nor
an
inclination
for
satire
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
side
,
I
be
so
entirely
satisfied
with
the
whole
present
procedure
of
human
thing
,
that
I
have
be
for
some
year
prepare
material
towards
"
a
Panegyric
upon
the
World
;
"
to
which
I
intend
to
add
a
second
part
,
entitle
"
a
modest
Defence
of
the
Proceedings
of
the

<EOS>
both
these
I
have
thought
to
publish
by
way
of
appendix
to
the
follow
treatise
;
but
find
my
common

place

fill
much
slow
than
I
have
reason
to
expect
<EOS>
,
I
have
choose
to
defer
them
to
another
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
I
have
be
unhappily
prevent
in
that
design
by
a
certain
domestic
misfortune
,
in
the
particular
whereof
,
though
it
would
be
very
seasonable
,
and
much
in
the
modern
way
,
to
inform
the
gentle
reader
,
and
would
also
be
of
great
assistance
towards
extend
this
preface
into
the
size
now
in
vogue
 
which
by
rule
ought
to
be
large
in
proportion
as
the
subsequent
volume
be
small
 
<EOS>
yet
I
shall
now
dismiss
our
impatient
reader
from
any
further
attendance
at
the
porch
;
and
have
duly
prepare
his
mind
by
a
preliminary
discourse

shall
gladly
introduce

sublime

the
INTRODUCTION
.
  
<EOS>
whoever
have
an
ambition
to
be
hear
in
a
crowd
must
press
,
and
squeeze
,
and
thrust
,
and
climb
with
indefatigable
pain
,
till
he
have
exalt
himself
to
a
certain
degree
of
altitude
above
them
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
in
all
assembly
,
though
you
wedge
them
ever
so
close
,
we
may
observe
this
peculiar
property
,
that
over
their
head
there
be
room
enough
;
but
how
to
reach
it
be
the
difficult
point
,
it
be
as
hard
to
get
quit
of
number
as
of
hell
.
  
<EOS>
"
 
Evadere
ad
aura
,
Hoc
opus
,
hic
labor
est
.
"
   
<EOS>
to
this
end
the
philosopher
's
way
in
all
age
have
be
by
erect
certain
edifice
in
the
air
;
but
whatever
practice
and
reputation
these
kind
of
structure
have
formerly
possess
,
or
may
still
continue
in
,
not
except
even
that
of
Socrates
when
he
be
suspend
in
a
basket
to
help
contemplation
,
I
think
,
with
due
submission
,
they
seem
to
labour
under
two
inconvenience
.
 
<EOS>
first
,
that
the
foundation
be
lay
too
high
,
they
have
be
often
out
of
sight
and
ever
out
of
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
secondly
,
that
the
material
be
very
transitory
,
have
suffer
much
from
inclemency
of
air
,
especially
in
these
north
-
west
region
.
  
<EOS>
therefore
,
towards
the
just
performance
of
this
great
work
there
remain
but
three
method
that
I
can
think
on
;
whereof
the
wisdom
of
our
ancestor
be
highly
sensible
,
have
,
to
encourage
all
aspire
adventure
,
think
fit
to
erect
three
wooden
machine
for
the
use
of
those
orator
who
desire
to
talk
much
without
interruption
.
<EOS>
these
be
the
Pulpit
,
the
Ladder
,
and
the
stage
-
itinerant
.
 
<EOS>
for
as
to
the
Bar
,
though
it
be
compound
of
the
same
matter
and
design
for
the
same
use
,
it
can
not
,
however
,
be
well
allow
the
honour
of
a
fourth
,
by
reason
of
its
level
or
inferior
situation
expose
it
to
perpetual
interruption
from
collateral
.
 
<EOS>
neither
can
the
Bench
itself
,
though
raise
to
a
proper
eminency
,
put
in
a
well
claim
,
whatever
its
advocate
insist
on
.
 
<EOS>
for
if
they
please
to
look
into
the
original
design
of
its
erection
,
and
the
circumstance
or
adjunct
subservient
to
that
design
,
they
will
soon
acknowledge
the
present
practice
exactly
correspondent
to
the
primitive
institution
,
and
both
to
answer
the
etymology
of
the
name
,
which
in
the
phoenician
tongue
be
a
word
of
great
signification
,
import
,
if
literally
interpret
,
"
the
place
of
sleep
,
"
but
in
common
acceptation
,
"
a
seat
well
bolster
and
cushion
,
for
the
repose
of
old
and
gouty
limb
;
"
sene
ut
in
otia
<EOS>
tuta
recedant
.
 
<EOS>
Fortune
be
indebte
to
them
this
part
of
retaliation
,
that
as
formerly
they
have
long
talk
whilst
other
sleep
,
so
now
they
may
sleep
as
long
whilst
other
talk
.
  
<EOS>
but
if
no
other
argument
could
occur
to
exclude
the
Bench
and
the
Bar
from
the
list
of
oratorical
machine
,
it
be
sufficient
that
the
admission
of
them
would
overthrow
a
number
which
I
be
resolve
to
establish
<EOS>
,
whatever
argument
it
may
cost
me
;
in
imitation
of
that
prudent
method
observe
by
many
other
philosopher
and
great
clerk
,
whose
chief
art
in
division
have
be
to
grow
fond
of
some
proper
mystical
number
,
which
their
imagination
have
render
sacred
to
a
degree
that
they
force
common
reason
to
find
room
for
it
in
every
part
of
Nature
,
reduce
,
include
,
and
adjusting
,
every
genus
and
specie
within
that
compass
by
couple
some
against
their
will
and
banish
other
at
any
rate
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
among
all
the
rest
,
the
profound
number
three
 
be
that
which
have
most
employ
my
sublime
speculation
,
nor
ever
without
wonderful
delight
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
now
in
the
press
,
and
will
be
publish
next
term
,
a
panegyrical
essay
of
mine
upon
this
number
,
wherein
I
have
,
by
most
convincing
proof
,
not
only
reduce
the
sense
and
the
element
under
its
banner
,
but
bring
over
several
deserter
from
its
two
great
rival
,
SEVEN
and
NINE
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
the
first
of
these
oratorical
machine
,
in
place
as
well
as
dignity
,
be
the
Pulpit
.
 
<EOS>
of
pulpit
<EOS>
there
be
in
this
island
several
sort
,
but
I
esteem
only
that
make
of
timber
from
the
Sylva
Caledonia
,
which
agree
very
well
with
our
climate
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
be
upon
its
decay
,
it
be
the
well
,
both
for
conveyance
of
sound
and
for
other
reason
to
be
mention
by
and
by
.
 
<EOS>
the
degree
of
perfection
in
shape
and
size
I
take
to
consist
in
be
extremely
narrow
,
with
little
ornament
,
and
,
good
of
all
,
without
a
cover
;
for
,
by
ancient
rule
,
it
ought
to
be
the
only
uncovered
vessel
in
every
assembly
where
it
be
rightfully
use
,
by
which
mean
,
from
its
near
resemblance
to
a
pillory
,
it
will
ever
have
a
mighty
influence
on
human
ear
.
  
<EOS>
of
ladder
<EOS>
I
need
say
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
observe
by
foreigner
themselves
,
to
the
honour
of
our
country
,
that
we
excel
all
nation
in
our
practice
and
understanding
of
this
machine
.
 
<EOS>
the
ascend
orator
do
not
only
oblige
their
audience
in
the
agreeable
delivery
,
but
the
whole
world
in
their
early
publication
of
their
speech
,
which
I
look
upon
as
the
choice
treasury
of
our
british
eloquence
,
and
whereof
I
be
inform
that
worthy
citizen
and
bookseller
,
Mr.
John
Dunton
,
have
make
a
faithful
and
a
painful
collection
,
which
he
shortly
design
to
publish
in
twelve
volume
in
folio
,
illustrate
with
copper
-
plate
,
 
a
work
highly
useful
and
curious
,
and
altogether
worthy
of
such
a
hand
.
  
<EOS>
the
last
engine
of
orator
be
the
stage
-
itinerant
,
erect
with
much
sagacity
,
sub
Jove
pluvio
,
in
triviis
et
quadriviis
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
great
seminary
of
the
two
former
,
and
its
orator
be
sometimes
prefer
to
the
one
and
sometimes
to
the
other
,
in
proportion
to
their
deserving
,
there
be
a
strict
and
perpetual
intercourse
between
all
three
.
  
<EOS>
from
this
accurate
deduction
it
be
manifest
that
for
obtain
attention
in
public
there
be
of
necessity
require
a
superior
position
of
place
.
 
<EOS>
but
although
this
point
be
generally
grant
,
yet
the
cause
be
little
agree
in
;
and
it
seem
to
me
that
very
few
philosopher
have
fall
into
a
true
natural
solution
of
this
phenomenon
.
 
<EOS>
the
deep
account
,
and
the
most
fairly
digested
of
any
I
have
yet
meet
with
be
this
,
that
air
be
a
heavy
body
,
and
therefore
,
accord
to
the
system
of
Epicurus
,
continually
descend
<EOS>
,
must
need
be
more
so
when
laden
and
press
down
by
word
,
which
be
also
body
of
much
weight
and
gravity
,
as
be
manifest
from
those
deep
impression
they
make
and
leave
upon
us
,
and
therefore
must
be
deliver
from
a
due
altitude
,
or
else
they
will
neither
carry
a
good
aim
nor
fall
down
with
a
sufficient
force
.

<EOS>
and
I
be
the
ready
to
favour
this
conjecture
from
a
common
observation
<EOS>
,
that
in
the
several
assembly
of
these
orator
Nature
itself
have
instruct
the
hearer
to
stand
with
their
mouth
open
and
erected
parallel
to
the
horizon
,
so
as
they
may
be
intersect
by
a
perpendicular
line
from
the
zenith
to
the
centre
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
in
which
position
,
if
the
audience
be
well
compact
,
every
one
carry
home
a
share
,
and
little
or
nothing
be
lose
.
  
<EOS>
I
confess
there
be
something
yet
more
refined
in
the
contrivance
and
structure
of
our
modern
theatre
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
first
,
the
pit
be
sink
below
the
stage
with
due
regard
to
the
institution
above
deduce
,
that
whatever
weighty
matter
shall
be
deliver
thence
,
whether
it
be
lead
or
gold
,
<EOS>
may
fall
plump
into
the
jaw
of
certain
critic
,
as
I
think
they
be
call
,
which
stand
ready
open
to
devour
them
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
box
be
build
round
and
raise
to
a
level
with
the
scene
,
in
deference
to
the
lady
,
because
that
large
portion
of
wit
lay
out
in
raise
prurience
and
protuberance
be
observe
to
run
much
upon
a
line
,
and
ever
in
a
circle
.
 
<EOS>
the
whine
passion
and
little
starved
conceit
be
gently
waft
up
by
their
own
extreme
levity
to
the
middle
region
,
and
there
fix
and
be
freeze
by
the
frigid
understanding
of
the
inhabitant
.
 
<EOS>
Bombast
and
buffoonery
,
by
nature
lofty
and
light
,
soar
high
of
all
,
and
would
be
lose
in
the
roof
if
the
prudent
architect
have
not
,
with
much
foresight
,
contrive
for
them
a
fourth
place
,
call
the
twelve
-
penny
gallery
,
and
there
plant
a
suitable
colony
,
who
greedily
intercept
them
in
their
passage
.
  
<EOS>
now
this
physico
-
logical
scheme
of
oratorical
receptacle
or
machine
contain
a
great
mystery
,
be
a
type
,
a
sign
,
an
emblem
,
a
shadow
,
a
symbol
,
bear
analogy
to
the
spacious
commonwealth
of
writer
and
to
those
method
by
which
they
must
exalt
themselves
to
a
certain
eminency
above
the
inferior
world
.
 
<EOS>
by
the
pulpit
be
adumbrate
the
writing
of
our
modern
saint
in
Great
Britain
,
as
they
have
spiritualise
and
refine
them
from
the
dross
and
grossness
of
sense
and
human
reason
.
 
<EOS>
the
matter
,
as
we
have
say
,
be
of
rotten
wood
,
and
that
upon
two
consideration
:
 
because
it
be
the
quality
of
rotten
wood
to
light
in
the
dark
;
and
secondly
,
because
its
cavity
be
full
of
worm
 
which
be
a
type
with
a
pair
of
handle
,
have
a
respect
to
the
two
principal
qualification
of
the
orator
and
the
two
different
fate
attend
upon
his
work
.
   
<EOS>
the
Ladder
be
an
adequate
symbol
of
faction
and
of
poetry
,
to
both
of
which
so
noble
a
number
of
author
be
indebted
for
their
fame
.
<EOS>
of
faction
,
because
.(Hiatus

MS

)
.
 
<EOS>
of
poetry
,
because
its
orator
do
perorare
with
a
song
;
and
because
,
climb
up
by
slow
degree
,
fate
be
sure
to
turn
them
off
before
they
can
reach
within
many
step
of
the
top
;
and
because
it
be
a
preferment
attain
by
transfer
of
propriety
and
a
confounding
of
meum
and
tuum
.
  
<EOS>
under
the
stage
-
itinerant
be
couch
those
production
design
for
the
pleasure
and
delight
of
mortal
man
,
such
as
"

"
Westminster
Drolleries

delightful
Tales

"
Complete

and
the
like
,
by
which
the
writer
of
and
for
Grub
Street
<EOS>
have
in
these
later
age
so
nobly
triumph
over
time
,
have
clip

wing

pare
his

file
his

turn
back
his
hour

glass
,
blunt
his
scythe

and
draw
the
hobnail
out
of
his
shoe

<EOS>
It
be
under
this
class
I
have
presume
to
list
my
present
treatise
,
<EOS>
be
just
come
from
have
the
honour
confer
upon
me
to
be
adopt
a
member
of
that
illustrious
fraternity
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
I
be
not
unaware
how
the
production
of
the
Grub
Street
brotherhood
have
of
late
year
fall
under
many
prejudice
,
nor
how
it
have
be
the
perpetual
employment
of
two
junior
start
-
up
society
to
ridicule
them
and
their
author
as
unworthy
their
establish
post
in
the
commonwealth
of
wit
and
learning
.
 
<EOS>
Their
own
conscience
will
easily
inform
them
whom
I
mean
;
nor
have
the
world
be
so
negligent
a
looker
-
on
as
not
to
observe
the
continual
effort
make
by
the
society
of
Gresham
and
of
Will
's
,
to
edify
a
name
and
reputation
upon
the
ruin
of
ours
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
be
yet
a
more
feeling
grief
to
us
,
upon
the
regard
of
tenderness
as
well
as
of
justice
,
when
we
reflect
on
their
proceeding
not
only
as
unjust
,
but
as
ungrateful
,
undutiful
,
and
unnatural
.
 
<EOS>
for
how
can
it
be
forget
by
the
world
or
themselves
,
to
say
nothing
of
our
own
record
,
which
be
full
and
clear
in
the
point
,
that
they
both
be
seminary
,
not
only
of
our
planting
,
but
our
watering
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
inform
our
two
rival
have
lately
make
an
offer
to
enter
into
the
list
with
united
forces
and
challenge
us
to
a
comparison
of
book
,
both
as
to
weight
and
number
.
 
<EOS>
in
return
to
which
,
with
license
from
our
president
,
I
humbly
offer
two
answer
.
 
<EOS>
first
,
we
say
the
proposal
be
like
that
which
Archimedes
make
upon
a
small
affair
,
include
an
impossibility
in
the
practice
;
for
where
can
they
find
scale
of
capacity
enough
for
the
first
,
or
an
arithmetician
of
capacity
enough
for
the
second
.
 
<EOS>
secondly
,
we
be
ready
to
accept
the
challenge
,
but
with
this
condition
,
that
a
third
indifferent
person
be
assign
,
to
whose
impartial
judgment
it
shall
be
leave
to
decide
which
society
each
book
,
treatise
,
or
pamphlet
do
most
properly
belong
to
.
 
<EOS>
this
point
,
God
know
,
be
very
far
from
be
fix
at
present
,
for
we
be
ready
to
produce
a
catalogue
of
some
thousand
which
in
all
common
justice
ought
to
be
entitle
to
our
fraternity
,
but
by
the
revolt
and
newfangle
writer
most
perfidiously
ascribe
to
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
upon
all
which
we
think
it
very
unbecoming
our
prudence
that
the
determination
should
be
remit
to
the
author
themselves
,
when
our
adversary
by
brigue
and
caballing
have
cause
so
universal
a
defection
from
us
,
that
the
great
part
of
our
society
have
already
desert
to
them
,
and
our
near
friend
begin
to
stand
aloof
,
as
if
they
be
half
ashamed
to
own
us
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
utmost
I
be
authorise
to
say
upon
so
ungrateful
and
melancholy
a
subject
,
because
we
be
extremely
unwilling
to
inflame
a
controversy
whose
continuance
may
be
so
fatal
to
the
interest
of
us
all
,
desire
much
rather
that
thing
be
amicably
compose
;
and
we
shall
so
far
advance
on
our
side
as
to
be
ready
to
receive
the
two
prodigal
with
open
arm
whenever
they
shall
think
fit
to
return
from
their
husk
and
their
harlot
,
which
I
think
,
from
the
present
course
of
their
study
,
they
most
properly
may
be
say
to
be
engage
in
,
and
,
like
an
indulgent
parent
,
continue
to
them
our
affection
and
our
blessing
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
great
maim
give
to
that
general
reception
which
the
writing
of
our
society
have
formerly
receive
,
next
to
the
transitory
state
of
all
sublunary
thing
,
have
be
a
superficial
vein
among
many
reader
of
the
present
age
,
who
will
by
no
means
be
persuade
to
inspect
beyond
the
surface
and
the
rind
of
thing
;
whereas
wisdom
be
a
fox
,
who
,
after
long
hunting
,
will
at
last
cost
you
the
pain
to
dig
out
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
cheese
which
,
by
how
much
the
rich
,
have
the
thick
,
the
homelier
,
and
the
coarser
coat
,
and
whereof
to
a
judicious
palate
the
maggot
be
the
good
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
sack

posset

wherein
the
deep
you
go
you
will
find
it
the
sweeter

<EOS>
wisdom
be
a
hen
whose
cackling
we
must
value
and
consider
,
because
it
be
attend
with
an
egg

<EOS>
but
then
,
lastly
,
it
be
a
nut
,
which
,
unless
you
choose
with
judgment
,
may
cost
you
a
tooth
,
and
pay
you
with
nothing
but
a
worm
.
 
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
these
momentous
truth
,
the
Grubaean
sage
have
always
choose
to
convey
their
precept
and
their
art
shut
up
within
the
vehicle
of
type
and
fable
;
which
have
be
perhaps
more
careful
and
curious
in
adorn
than
be
altogether
necessary
,
it
have
fare
with
these
vehicle
after
the
usual
fate
of
coach
over

finely
paint
and
gild
,
that
the
transitory
gazer
have
so
dazzle
their
eye
and
fill
their
imagination
with
the
outward
lustre
,
as
neither
to
regard
nor
consider
the
person
or
the
part
of
the
owner
within
.
 
<EOS>
a
misfortune
we
undergo
with
somewhat
less
reluctancy
,
because
it
have
be
common
to
us
with
Pythagoras
,
AEsop
,
Socrates
,
and
other
of
our
predecessor
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
that
neither
the
world
nor
ourselves
may
any
longer
suffer
by
such
misunderstanding
,
I
have
be
prevail
on
,
after
much
importunity
from
my
friend
,
to
travail
in
a
complete
and
laborious
dissertation
upon
the
prime
production
of
our
society
,
which
,
besides
their
beautiful
external
for
the
gratification
of
superficial
reader
,
have
darkly
and
deeply
couch
under
them
the
most
finished
and
refined
system
of
all
science
and
art
,
as
I
do
not
doubt
to
lay
open
by
untwist
or
unwinding
,
and
either
to
draw
up
by
exantlation
or
display
by
incision

<EOS>
this
great
work
be
enter
upon
some
year
ago
by
one
of
our
most
eminent
member

<EOS>
He
begin
with
the
"
history
of
Reynard

but
neither
live
to
publish
his
essay
nor
to
proceed
farther
in
so
useful
an
attempt
,
which
be
very
much
to
be
lament
,
because
the
discovery
he
make
and
communicate
to
his
friend
be
now
universally
receive
;
nor
do
I
think
any
of
the
learn
will
dispute
that
famous
treatise
to
be
a
complete
body
of
civil
knowledge
,
and
the
revelation
,
or
rather
the
apocalypse
,
of
all
state
arcana
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
progress
I
have
make
be
much
great
,
have
already
finish
my
annotation
upon
several
dozen
from
some

I
shall
impart
a

hint
to
the
candid

,
as
far
as
will
be
necessary
to
the
conclusion
at
which
I
aim

<EOS>
the
first
piece
I
have
handle
be
that
of

<EOS>
this

treatise
contain
the
whole
scheme
of
the
metempsychosis
,
deduce
the
progress
of
the

through
all
her
stage

<EOS>
the
next
be
"
Dr.

by

fourth
year
 
of

age
;
this
writer
proceed
wholly
by
reincrudation
,
or
in
the
via
humida
;
and
the
marriage
between
Faustus
and
Helen
do
most
conspicuously
dilucidate
the
fermenting
of
the
male
and
female
dragon
.

<EOS>
these

an
idea

what
the

likely
to
produce

wherein
I
have

altogether
circumscribe

if
I
can
bring
it
to
a
perfection
before
I

shall
reckon
I
have
well
employ
the
poor

<EOS>
but
to
return

<EOS>
I
be
assure
from
the
reader
's
candour
that
the
brief
speciman
I
have
give
will
easily
clear
all
the
rest
of
our
society
's
production
from
an
aspersion
grow
,
as
it
be
manifest
,
out
of
envy
and
ignorance
,
that
they
be
of
little
farth
use
or
value
to
mankind
beyond
the
common
entertainment
of
their
wit
and
their
style
;
for
these
I
be
sure
have
never
yet
be
dispute
by
our
keen
adversary
;
in
both
which
,
as
well
as
the
more
profound
and
most
mystical
part
,
I
have
throughout
this
treatise
closely
follow
the
most
applaud
original
.
 
<EOS>
and
to
render
all
complete
I
have
with
much
thought
and
application
of
mind
<EOS>
so
order
that
the
chief
title
prefix
to
it
(
I
mean
that
under
which
I
design
it
shall
pass
in
the
common
conversation
of
court
and
town
)
<EOS>
be
model
exactly
after
the
manner
peculiar
to
our
society
.
  
<EOS>
I
confess
to
have
be
somewhat
liberal
in
the
business
of
title
,
have
observe
the
humour
of
multiply
them
,
to
bear
great
vogue
among
certain
writer
,
whom
I
exceedingly
reverence
.
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
it
seem
not
unreasonable
that
book
,
the
child
of
the
brain
,
should
have
the
honour
to
be
christen
with
variety
of
name
,
as
well
as
other
infant
of
quality
.
 
<EOS>
Our
famous
Dryden
have
venture
to
proceed
a
point
farther
,
endeavour
to
introduce
also
a
multiplicity
of
godfather
,
which
be
an
improvement
of
much
more
advantage
,
upon
a
very
obvious
account
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
pity
this
admirable
invention
have
not
be
better
cultivate
,
so
as
to
grow
by
this
time
into
general
imitation
,
when
such
an
authority
serve
it
for
a
precedent
.
 
<EOS>
nor
have
my
endeavour
be
want
to
second
<EOS>
so
useful
an
example
,
but
it
seem
there
be
an
unhappy
expense
usually
annex
to
the
calling
of
a
godfather
,
which
be
clearly
out
of
my
head
,
as
it
be
very
reasonable
to
believe
.
 
<EOS>
where
the
pinch
lie
,
I
can
not
certainly
affirm
;
but
have
employ
a
world
of
thought
and
pain
to
split
my
treatise
into
forty
section
,
and
have
entreat
forty
Lords
of
my
acquaintance
that
they
would
do
me
the
honour
to
stand

they
all
make
it
matter

as
well
as

have
provide
each

you
(

a
new
coat

<EOS>
now

you
be
to
understand
that
these

two
virtue
contain
in
them
;
one
be
,
that
with
good
wear
they
will
last
you
fresh
and
sound
as
long
as
you
live

the
other
be

that
they
will
grow
in

lengthen

widening
of
themselves

clean

often

You

find
in
my
will
(
here
it
be
)
full
instruction
in
every
particular
concern
the
wear
and
management
of
your
coat

wherein
you
must
be
very
exact
to
avoid
the
penalty
I
have
appoint
for
every
transgression
or
neglect
,
upon
which
your
future
fortune
will
entirely
depend
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
also
command
in
my
will
that
you
should
live
together
in
one
house
like
brother
and
friend

for
then
you
will
be

thrive

not
otherwise

fortune

I
shall
not
trouble
you
with
recount
what
adventure
they
meet
for
the
first
seven
year

any
farther
than
by
take
notice
that
they
carefully
observe
their
father

will
and
keep
their
coat
in
very
good
order

travel
through

Countess

<EOS>
on
their
first
appearance
,
our
three
adventurer
meet
with
a
very
bad
reception
,
and
soon
with
great
sagacity
guess
out
the
reason
,
they
quickly
begin
to
improve
in
the
good
quality
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
They
write
,
and
rally
,
and
rhyme
,
and
sung
,
and
say
,
and
say
nothing
;
they
drink
,
and
fight
,
and
sleep
,
and
swear
,
and
take
snuff
;
they
go
to
new
play
on
the
first
night

haunt
the
chocolate

house
,
beat
the
watch
;
they
bilk
hackney

coachmen

run
in
debt
with
shopkeeper

lie
with
their
wife

they
kill
bailiff
,
kick
fiddler
down

stair
,
eat
at
Locket

,
loiter
at
Will

they
talk
of
the
drawing

room
and
never
come
there
;
dine
with
lord
they
never
see

whisper
a
duchess
and
speak
never
a
word
;
expose
the
scrawl
of
their
laundress
for
billet

doux
of
quality
;
come
ever
just
from
court
and
be
never
see
in
it
;
attend
the
levee
sub
dio
;
get
a
list
of
peer
by
heart
in
one
company
,
and
with
great
familiarity
retail
them
in
another
.
 
<EOS>
above
all
,
they
constantly
attend
those
committee
of
senator
who
be
silent
in
the
House

loud
in
the
coffeehouse

where
they
nightly
adjourn
to
chew
the
cud

be
encompass
with
a
ring

up

<EOS>
the
three

have
acquire
forty
other

too
tedious
to
recount

by
consequence

reckon
the
most
accomplished

all
would
not
suffice

and
the

continue
still
inflexible

<EOS>
to
clear
up
which
difficulty
,
I
must
,
with
the

good
leave

have
recourse
to
some
point
of
weight

the

not
sufficiently
illustrate

about
this

it

a
sect
arise
whose
tenet
obtain
and
spread
very
far
,
especially
in
the
grand
monde
,
and
among
everybody
of
good
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
They
worship
a
sort
of
idol
,
who
,
as
their
doctrine
deliver
,
do
daily
create
man
by
a
kind
of
manufactory
operation
.
 
<EOS>
this
idol
they
place
in
the
high
part
of
the
house
on
an
altar
erect
about
three
foot
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
show
in
the
posture
of
a
persian
emperor
sit
on
a
superficie
with
his
leg
interweave
under
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
god
have
a
goose
for
his
ensign
,
whence
<EOS>
it
be
that
some
learn
man
pretend
to
deduce
his
original
from
Jupiter
Capitolinus
.
 
<EOS>
at
his
left
hand
,
beneath
the
altar
,
Hell
seem
to
open
and
catch
at
the
animal
the
idol
be
create
,
to
prevent
which
,
certain
of
his
priest
hourly
fling
in
piece
of
the
uninformed
mass
or
substance
,
and
sometimes
whole
limb
already
enliven
,
which
that
horrid
gulph
insatiably
swallow
,
terrible
to
behold
.
 
<EOS>
the
goose
be
also
hold
a
subaltern
divinity
or
Deus
minorum
gentium
,
before
whose
shrine
be
sacrifice
that
creature
whose
hourly
food
be
human
gore
,
and
who
be
in
so
great
renown
abroad
for
be
the
delight
and
favourite
of
the
Egyptian
Cercopithecus
.
 
<EOS>
million
of
these
animal
be
cruelly
slaughter
every
day
to
appease
the
hunger
of
that
consume
deity
.
<EOS>
the
chief
idol
be
also
worship
as
the
inventor
of
the
yard
and
the
needle
,
whether
as
the
god
of
seamen
,
or
on
account
of
certain
other
mystical
attribute
,
hath
not
be
sufficiently
clear
.
  
<EOS>
the
worshipper
of
this
deity
have
also
a
system
of
their
belief
which
seem
to
turn
upon
the
follow
fundamental
.
 
<EOS>
They
hold
the
universe
to
be
a
large
suit
of
clothe
which
invest
everything
;
that
the
earth
be
invest
by
the
air
;
the
air
be
invest
by
the
star
;
and
the
star
be
invest
by
the
Primum
Mobile
.
 
<EOS>
look
on
this
globe
of
earth
,
you
will
find
it
to
be
a
very
complete
and
fashionable
dress
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
that
which
some
call
land
but
<EOS>
a
fine
coat
face
with
green
,
or
the
sea
but
a
waistcoat
of
water
-
tabby
?
<EOS>
proceed
to
the
particular
work
of
the
creation
,
you
will
find
how
curious
journeyman
Nature
hath
be
to
trim
up
the
vegetable
beaux
;
observe
how
sparkish
a
periwig
adorn
the
head
of
a
beech
,
and
what
a
fine
doublet
of
white
satin
be
wear
by
the
birch
.
 
<EOS>
to
conclude
from
all
,
what
be
man
himself
but
a
microcoat
,
or
rather
a
complete
suit
of
clothe
with
all
its
trimming
?
 
<EOS>
as
to
his
body
there
can
be
no
dispute
,
but
examine
even
the
acquirement
of
his
mind
,
you
will
find
them
all
contribute
in
their
order
towards
furnish
out
an
exact
dress
.
 
<EOS>
to
instance
no
more
,
be
not
religion
a
cloak
,
honesty
a
pair
of
shoe
wear
out
in
the
dirt
,
<EOS>
self
-
love
a
surtout
,
vanity
a
shirt
,
and
conscience
a
pair
of
breech
,
which
,
though
a
cover
for
lewdness
as
well
as
nastiness
,
be
easily
slip
down
for
the
service
of
both
.
  
<EOS>
these
postulata
be
admit
,
it
will
follow
in
due
course
of
reason
that
those
being
which
the
world
call
improperly
suit
of
clothe
be
in
reality
the
most
refined
specie
of
animal
,
or
to
proceed
higher
,
that
they
be
rational
creature
or
man
.
 
<EOS>
for
be
it
not
manifest
that
they
live
,
and
move
,
and
talk
,
and
perform
all
other
office
of
human
life
?
 
<EOS>
be
not
beauty
,
and
wit
,
and
mien
,
and
breed
their
inseparable
propriety
?
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
we
see
nothing
but
them
,
hear
nothing
but
them
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
not
they
who
walk
the
street
,
fill
up
Parliament-
,
coffee-
,
play-
,
bawdy
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
indeed
,
that
these
animal
,
which
be
vulgarly
call
suit
of
clothe
or
dress
,
do
accord
to
certain
composition
receive
different
appellation
.
 
<EOS>
if
one
of
them
be
trim
up
with
a
gold
chain
,
and
a
red
gown
,
and
a
white
rod
,
and
a
great
horse
,
it
be
call
a
Lord
Mayor
;
if
certain
ermine
and
fur
be
place
in
a
certain
position
,
we
style
them
a
judge
,
and
so
an
apt
conjunction
of
lawn
and
black
satin
we
entitle
a
Bishop
.
  
<EOS>
other
of
these
professor
,
though
agree
in
the
main
system
,
be
yet
more
refined
upon
certain
branch
of
it
;
and
hold
that
man
be
an
animal
compound
of
two
dress
,
the
natural
and
the
celestial
suit
,
which
be
the
body
and
the
soul
;
that
the
soul
be
the
outward
,
and
the
body
the
inward
clothing
;
that
the
latter
be
ex
traduce
,
but
the
former
of
daily
creation
and
circumfusion
.
 
<EOS>
this
last
they
prove
by
scripture
,
because
in
them
we
live
,
and
move
,
and
have
our
be
:
 
as
likewise
by
philosophy
,
because
they
be
all
in
all
,
and
all
in
every
part
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
say
they
,
separate
these
two
,
and
you
will
find
the
body
to
be
only
a
senseless
unsavoury
carcass
.
 
<EOS>
by
all
which
it
be
manifest
that
the
outward
dress
must
need
be
the
soul
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
system
of
religion
be
tag
several
subaltern
doctrine
,
which
be
entertain
with
great
vogue
;
as
particularly
the
faculty
of
the
mind
be
deduce
by
the
learn
among
them
in
this
manner
:
 
<EOS>
embroidery
be
sheer
wit
,
gold
fringe
be
agreeable
conversation
,
gold
lace
be
repartee
,
a
huge
long
periwig
be
humour
,
and
a
coat
full
of
powder
be
very
good
raillery
.
 
<EOS>
all
which
require
abundance
of
finesse
and
delicatesse
to
manage
with
advantage
,
as
well
as
a
strict
observance
after
time
and
fashion
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
with
much
pain
and
read
collect
out
of
ancient
author
this
short
summary
of
a
body
of
philosophy
and
divinity
which
seem
to
have
be
compose
by
a
vein
and
race
of
think
very
different
from
any
other
system
,
either
ancient
or
modern
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
not
merely
to
entertain
or
satisfy
the
reader
's
curiosity
,
but
rather
to
give
him
light
into
several
circumstance
of
the
follow
story
,
that
,
know
the
state
of
disposition
and
opinion
in
an
age
so
remote
,
he
may
better
comprehend
those
great
event
which
be
the
issue
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
advise
,
therefore
,
the
courteous
reader
to
peruse
with
a
world
of
application
,
again
and
again
,
<EOS>
whatever
I
have
write
upon
this
matter
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
leave
these
broken
end
,
I
carefully
gather
up
the
chief
thread
of
my
story
,
and
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
these
opinion
,
therefore
,
be
so
universal
,
as
well
as
the
practice
of
them
,
among
the
refined
part
of
court
and
town
,
that
our
three
brother
adventurer
,
as
their
circumstance
then
stand
,
be
strangely
at
a
loss
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
on
the
one
side
,
the
three
lady
they
address
themselves
to
(
whom
we
have
name
already
)
be
ever
at
the
very
top
of
the
fashion
,
and
abhor
all
that
be
below
it
but
the
breadth
of
a
hair
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
side
,
their
father
's
will
be
very
precise
,
and
it
be
the
main
precept
in
it
,
with
the
great
penalty
annex
,
not
to
add
to
or
diminish
from
their
coat
one
thread
without
a
positive
command
in
the
will
.
 
<EOS>
now
the
coat
their
father
have
leave
them
be
,
it
be
true
,
of
very
good
cloth
,
and
besides
,
so
neatly
sewn
you
would
swear
they
be
all
of
a
piece
,
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
very
plain
,
with
little
or
no
ornament
;
and
it
happen
that
before
they
be
a
month
in
town
<EOS>
great
shoulder
-
knot
come
up
.
 
<EOS>
straight
all
the
world
be
shoulder
-
knot
;
no
approach
the
lady
'
ruelle
without
the
quota
of
shoulder
-
knot
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
fellow
,
"
cry
one
,
"
have
no
soul
:
 
<EOS>
where
be
his
shoulder
-
knot
?
"
  
<EOS>
Our
three
brother
soon
discover
their
want
by
sad
experience
,
meet
in
their
walk
with
forty
mortification
and
indignity
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
go
to
the
playhouse
,
the
doorkeeper
show
them
into
the
twelve
-
penny
gallery
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
call
a
boat
,
say
a
waterman
,
"
I
be
first
sculler
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
if
they
step
into
the
"
Rose
"
to
take
a
bottle
,
the
drawer
would
cry
,
"
friend
,
we
sell
no
ale
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
if
they
go
to
visit
a
lady
,
a
footman
meet
them
at
the
door
with
"
pray
,
send
up
your
message
.
"
 
<EOS>
in
this
unhappy
case
they
go
immediately
to
consult
their
father
's
will
,
read
it
over
and
over
,
but
not
a
word
of
the
shoulder
-
knot
.
 
<EOS>
what
should
they
do
?
 
<EOS>
what
temper
should
they
find
?
 
<EOS>
Obedience
be
absolutely
necessary
,
and
yet
shoulder
-
knot
appear
extremely
requisite
.
 
<EOS>
after
much
thought
,
one
of
the
brother
,
who
happen
to
be
more
book
-
learn
than
the
other
two
,
say
he
have
find
an
expedient
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
true
,
"
say
he
,
"
there
be
nothing
here
in
this
<EOS>
will
,
totidem
verbis
,
make
mention
of
shoulder
-
knot
,
but
I
dare
conjecture
we
may
find
them
inclusive
,
or
totidem
syllabis
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
distinction
be
immediately
approve
by
all
;
and
so
they
fall
again
to
examine
the
will
.
 
<EOS>
but
their
evil
star
have
so
direct
the
matter
that
the
first
syllable
be
not
to
be
find
in
the
whole
writing
;
upon
which
disappointment
,
he
who
find
the
former
evasion
take
heart
,
and
say
,
"
brother
,
there
be
yet
hope
;
for
though
we
can
not
find
them
totidem
verbis
nor
totidem
syllabis
,
I
dare
engage
we
shall
make
them
out
tertio
modo
or
totidem
literis
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
discovery
be
also
highly
commend
,
upon
which
they
fall
once
more
to
the
scrutiny
,
and
soon
pick
out
S
,
H
,
o
,
U
,
L
,
D
,
e
,
r
,
when
the
same
planet
,
enemy
to
their
repose
,
have
wonderfully
contrive
that
a
K
be
not
to
be
find
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
a
weighty
difficulty
!
 
<EOS>
but
the
distinguish
brother
(
for
whom
we
shall
hereafter
find
a
name
)
,
now
his
hand
be
in
,
prove
by
a
very
good
argument
that
K
be
a
modern
illegitimate
letter
,
unknown
to
the
learned
age
,
nor
anywhere
to
be
find
in
ancient
manuscript
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
true
,
"
say
he
,
"
the
word
Calendae
,
have
in
Q.
V.
C.
 
be
sometimes
writ
with
a
k
,
but
erroneously
,
for
in
the
good
copy
it
be
ever
spelt
with
a
c
;
and
by
consequence
it
be
a
gross
mistake
in
our
language
to
spell
"
knot
"
with
a
k
,
"
but
that
from
henceforward
he
would
take
care
<EOS>
it
should
be
writ
with
a
c.
 
<EOS>
upon
this
all
further
difficulty
vanish
;
shoulder
-
knot
be
make
clearly
out
to
be
jure
paterno
,
and
our
three
gentleman
swagger
with
as
large
and
as
flaunting
one
as
the
good
.
  
<EOS>
but
as
human
happiness
be
of
a
very
short
duration
,
so
in
those
day
be
human
fashion
,
upon
which
it
entirely
depend
.
 
<EOS>
Shoulder
-
knot
have
their
time
,
and
we
must
now
imagine
them
in
their
decline
,
for
a
certain
lord
come
just
from
Paris
with
fifty
yard
of
gold
lace
upon
his
coat
,
exactly
trim
after
the
court
fashion
of
that
month
.
 
<EOS>
in
two
day
all
mankind
appear
close
up
in
bar
of
gold
lace
.
<EOS>
whoever
durst
peep
abroad
without
his
complement
of
gold
lace
be
as
scandalous
as
a
#
#
#
#
,
and
as
ill
receive
among
the
woman
.
 
<EOS>
what
should
our
three
knight
do
in
this
momentous
affair
?
 
<EOS>
They
have
sufficiently
strain
a
point
already
in
the
affair
of
shoulder
-
knot
.
<EOS>
upon
recourse
to
the
will
,
nothing
appear
there
but
altum
silentium
.
 
<EOS>
that
of
the
shoulder
-
knot
be
a
loose
,
flying
,
circumstantial
point
,
but
this
of
gold
lace
seem
too
considerable
an
alteration
without
well
warrant
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
aliquo
modo
essentiae
adhaerere
,
and
therefore
require
a
positive
precept
.
 
<EOS>
but
about
this
time
it
fall
out
that
the
learn
brother
aforesaid
have
read
"
Aristotelis
Dialectica
,
"
and
especially
that
wonderful
piece
de
Interpretatione
,
which
have
the
faculty
of
teach
its
reader
to
find
out
a
meaning
in
everything
but
itself
,
like
commentator
on
the
Revelations
,
who
proceed
prophet
without
understand
a
syllable
of
the
text
.
 
<EOS>
"
Brothers
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
be
to
be
inform
that
of
will
,
duo
sunt
genera
,
nuncupatory
and
scriptory
,
 
that
in
the
scriptory
will
here
before
us
there
be
no
precept
or
mention
about
gold
lace
,
conceditur

but

<EOS>
for
,
brother
,
if
you
remember
,
we
hear
a
fellow
say
when
we
be
boy
that
he
hear
<EOS>
my
father

man
say
that
he
hear
my
father
say
that
he
would
advise
his
son
to
get
gold
lace
on
their
coat
as
soon
as
ever
they
could
procure
money
to
buy
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>

that
be
very
true

"
cry
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
remember
it
perfectly
well
,
"
say
the
third
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
without
more
ado
,
they
get
the
large
gold
lace
in
the
parish
,
and
walk
about
as
fine
as
lord
.
  
<EOS>
a
while
after
,
there
come
up
all
in
fashion
a
pretty
sort
of
flame

colour
satin
 
for

,
and
the
mercer
bring
a

my

upon
this

fall
again
to
rummage
the

,
because
the
present
case
also
require
a
positive
precept
,
the
lining
be
hold
by
orthodox
writer
to
be
of
the

<EOS>
after
long
search
they
could
fix
upon
nothing
to
the
matter
in
hand
,
except
a
short
advice
in
their
father
's
will
to
take
care
of
fire
and
put
out
their
candle
before
they
go
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
though
a
good
deal
for
the
purpose
,
and
help
very
far
towards
self
-
conviction
,
yet
not
seem
wholly
of
force
to
establish
a

,
and
be
resolve
to

farther

as
well
as
future

he
<EOS>
that

the

,
"
I
remember
to
have
read
in

of
a
codicil

,
which
be
indeed
a
part
of
the
will
,
and
what
it
contain
hath
equal
authority
with
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
now
I
have
be
consider
of
this
same
will
here
before
us
,
and
I
can
not
reckon
it
to
be
complete
for
want
of
such
a
codicil
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
therefore
fasten
one
in
its
proper
place
very
dexterously
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
have
it
by
me
some
time
;
it
be
write
by
a
dog
-
keeper
of
my
grandfather

,
and
talk
a
great

,
as
good
luck
would
have
it

very
flame

<EOS>
the
project
be
immediately
approve
by
the
other
two
;
an
old
parchment
scroll
be
tag
on
accord
to
art
,
in
the
form
of
a
codicil
annex
,
and
the
satin
buy
and
wear
.
  
<EOS>
next
winter
a
player
,
hire
for
the
purpose
by
the
Corporation
of
Fringemakers
,
act
his
part
in
a
new
comedy
,
all
cover
with
silver
fringe
,
and
accord
to
the
laudable
custom
give
rise
to
that
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
upon
which
the
brother
,
consult
their
father
's
will
,
to
their
great
astonishment
find
these
word
:
 
<EOS>
"
item
,
I
charge
and
command
<EOS>
my
say
three
son
to
wear
no
sort
of
silver
fringe
upon
or
about
their
say
coat
,
"
&
c.
,
with
a
penalty
in
case
of
disobedience
too
long
here
to
insert
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
after
some
pause
,
the
brother
so
often
mention
for
his
erudition
,
who
be
well
skilled
in
criticism
,
have
find
in
a
certain
author
,
which
he
say
should
be
nameless
,
that
the
same
word
which
in
the
will
be
call
fringe
do
also
signify
a
broom
-
stick
,
and
doubtless
ought
to
have
the
same
interpretation
in
this
paragraph
.
 
<EOS>
this
another
of
the
brother
dislike
,
because
of
that
epithet
silver
,
which
could
not
,
he
humbly
conceive
,
in
propriety
of
speech
be
reasonably
apply
to
a
broom
-
stick
;
but
it
be
reply
upon
him
that
this
epithet
be
understand
in
a
mythological
and
allegorical
sense
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
object
again
why
their
father
should
forbid
them
to
wear
a
broom
-
stick
on
their
coat
,
a
caution
that
seem
unnatural
and
impertinent
;
upon
which
he
be
take
up
short
,
as
one
that
speak
irreverently
of
a
mystery
which
doubtless
be
very
useful
and
significant
,
but
ought
not
to
be
over
-
curiously
pry
into
or
nicely
reason
upon
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
short
,
their
father
's
authority
be
now
considerably
sink
,
this
expedient
be
allow
to
serve
as
a
lawful
dispensation
for
wear
their
full
proportion
of
silver
fringe
.
  
<EOS>
a
while
after
be
revive
an
old
fashion
,
long
antiquated
,
of
embroidery
with
indian
figure
of
man
,
woman
,
and
child
.
<EOS>
here
they
have
no
occasion
to
examine
the
will
.
 
<EOS>
They
remember
but
too
well
how
their
father
have
always
abhor
this
fashion
;
that
he
make
several
paragraph
on
purpose
,
import
his
utter
detestation
of
it
,
and
bestow
his
everlasting
curse
to
his
son
whenever
they
should
wear
it
.
 
<EOS>
for
all
this
,
in
a
few
day
they
appear
high
in
the
fashion
than
anybody
else
in
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
solve
the
matter
by
say
that
these
figure
be
not
at
all
the
same
with
those
that
be
formerly
wear
and
be
mean
in
the
will
;
besides
,
they
do
not
wear
them
in
that
sense
,
as
forbid
by
their
father
,
but
as
they
be
a
commendable
custom
,
and
of
great
use
to
the
public
.
 
<EOS>
that
these
rigorous
clause
in
the
will
do
therefore
require
some
allowance
and
a
favourable
interpretation
,
and
ought
to
be
understand
cum
grano
salis
.
  
<EOS>
but
fashion
perpetually
alter
in
that
age
,
the
scholastic
brother
grow
weary
of
search
further
evasion
and
solve
everlasting
contradiction
.
 
<EOS>
resolve
,
therefore
,
at
all
hazard
to
comply
with
the
mode
of
the
world
,
they
concert
matter
together
,
and
agree
unanimously
to
lock
up
their
father
's
will
in
a
strong
-
box
,
bring
out
of
Greece
or
Italy
 
(
I
have
forget
which
)
,
and
trouble
themselves
no
farther
to
examine
it
,
but
only
refer
to
its
authority
whenever
they
think
fit
.
 
<EOS>
in
consequence
whereof
,
a
while
after
it
grow
a
general
mode
to
wear
an
infinite
number
of
point
,
most
of
them
tag
with
silver
;
upon
which
the
scholar
pronounce
ex
cathedra
 
<EOS>
that
point
be
absolutely
jure
paterno
as
they
may
very
well
remember
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
indeed
,
the
fashion
prescribe
somewhat
more
than
be
directly
name
in
the
will
;
however
,
that
they
,
as
heir
-
general
of
their
father
,
have
power
to
make
and
add
certain
clause
for
public
emolument
,
though
not
deducible
todidem
verbis
from
the
letter
of
the
will
,
or
else
multa
absurda

.
 
<EOS>
this
be
understand
for
canonical
,
and
therefore
on
the
follow
Sunday
they
come
to
church
all
cover
with
point
.
  
<EOS>
the
learned
brother
so
often
mention
be
reckon
the
good
scholar
in
all
that
or
the
next
street
to
it
;
insomuch
,
as
have
run
something
behindhand
with
the
world
,
he
obtain
the
favour
from
a
certain
lord
 
to
receive
him
into
his
house
and
to
teach
his
child
.
 
<EOS>
a
while
after
the
lord
die
,
and
he
,
by
long
practice
upon
his
father
's
will
,
find
the
way
of
contrive
a
deed
of
conveyance
of
that
house
to
himself
and
his

upon

he
take

section
III

<EOS>
a
digression
concern
critics
.
  
<EOS>
though
I
have
be
hitherto
as
cautious
as
I
could
,
upon
all
occasion
,
most
nicely
to
follow
the
rule
and
method
of
writing
lay
down
by
the
example
of
our
illustrious
modern
,
yet
have
the
unhappy
shortness
of
my
memory
lead
me
into
an
error
,
from
which
I
must
immediately
extricate
myself
,
before
I
can
decently
pursue
my
principal
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
confess
with
shame
<EOS>
it
be
an
unpardonable
omission
to
proceed
so
far
as
I
have
already
do
before
I
have
perform
the
due
discourse
,
expostulatory
,
supplicatory
,
or
deprecatory
,
with
my
good
lord
the
critic
.
 
<EOS>
towards
some
atonement
for
this
grievous
neglect
,
I
do
here
make
humbly
bold
to
present
them
with
a
short
account
of
themselves
and
their
art
,
by
look
into
the
original
and
pedigree
of
the
word
,
as
it
be
generally
understand
among
us
,
and
very
briefly
consider
the
ancient
and
present
state
thereof
.
  
<EOS>
by
the
word
critic
,
at
this
day
so
frequent
in
all
conversation
,
there
have
sometimes
be
distinguish
three
very
different
specie
of
mortal
man
,
accord
as
I
have
read
in
ancient
book
and
pamphlet
.
 
<EOS>
for
first
,
by
this
term
be
understand
such
person
as
invent
or
draw
up
rule
for
themselves
and
the
world
,
by
observe
which
a
careful
reader
may
be
able
to
pronounce
upon
the
production
of
the
learn
,
form
his
taste
to
a
true
relish
of
the
sublime
and
the
admirable
,
and
divide
every
beauty
of
matter
or
of
style
from
the
corruption
that
ape
it
.
 
<EOS>
in
their
common
perusal
of
book
,
single
out
the
error
and
defect
,
the
nauseous
,
the
fulsome
,
the
dull
,
and
the
impertinent
,
with
the
caution
of
a
man
that
walk
through
Edinburgh
street
in
a
morning
,
who
be
indeed
as
careful
as
he
can
to
watch
diligently
and
spy
out
the
filth
in
his
way
;
not
that
he
be
curious
to
observe
the
colour
and
complexion
of
the
ordure
or
take
its
dimension
,
much
less
to
be
paddle
in
or
taste
it
,
but
only
with
a
design
to
come
out
as
cleanly
as
he
may
.
<EOS>
these
man
seem
,
though
very
erroneously
,
to
have
understand
the
appellation
of
critic
in
a
literal
sense
;
that
one
principal
part
of
his
office
be
to
praise
and
acquit
,
and
that
a
critic
who
set
up
to
read
only
for
an
occasion
of
censure
and
reproof
be
a
creature
as
barbarous
as
a
judge
who
should
take
up
a
resolution
to
hang
all
man
that
come
before
him
upon
a
trial
.
  
<EOS>
again
,
by
the
word
critic
have
be
mean
the
restorer
of
ancient
learn
from
the
worm
,
and
grave
,
and
dust
of
manuscript
.
  
<EOS>
now
the
race
of
these
two
have
be
for
some
age
utterly
extinct
,
and
besides
to
discourse
any
further
of
them
would
not
be
at
all
to
my
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
the
third
and
noblest
sort
be
that
of
the
true
critic
,
whose
original
be
the
most
ancient
of
all
.
 
<EOS>
every
true
critic
be
a
hero
bear
,
descend
in
a
direct
line
from
a
celestial
stem
,
by
Momus
and
Hybris
,
who
beget
Zoilus
,
who
beget
Tigellius
,
who
beget
Etcaetera
the
elder
,
who
beget
Bentley
,
and
Rymer
,
and
Wotton
,
and
Perrault
,
and
Dennis
,
who
beget
Etcaetera
the
young
.
  
<EOS>
and
these
be
the
critic
from
whom
the
commonwealth
of
learning
have
in
all
age
receive
such
immense
benefit
,
that
the
gratitude
of
their
admirer
place
their
origin
in
heaven
,
among
those
of
hercule
,
Theseus
,
Perseus
,
and
other
great
deserver
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
but
heroic
virtue
itself
hath
not
be
exempt
from
the
obloquy
of
evil
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
for
it
hath
be
object
that
those
ancient
hero
,
famous
for
their
combating
so
many
giant
,
and
dragon
,
and
robber
,
be
in
their
own
person
a
great
nuisance
to
mankind
than
any
of
those
monster
they
subdue
;
and
therefore
,
to
render
their
obligation
more
complete
,
when
all
other
vermin
be
destroy
,
should
in
conscience
have
conclude
with
the
same
justice
upon
themselves
,
as
Hercules
most
generously
do
,
and
hath
upon
that
score
procure
for
himself
more
temple
and
votary
than
the
good
of
his
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
for
these
reason
I
suppose
it
be
why
some
have
conceive
it
would
be
very
expedient
for
the
public
good
of
learn
that
every
true
critic
,
as
soon
as
he
have
finish
his
task
assign
,
should
immediately
deliver
himself
up
to
ratsbane
or
hemp
,
or
from
some
convenient
altitude
,
and
that
no
man
's
pretension
to
so
illustrious
a
character
should
by
any
mean
be
receive
before
that
operation
be
perform
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
from
this
heavenly
descent
of
criticism
,
and
the
close
analogy
it
bear
to
heroic
virtue
,
it
be
easy
to
assign
the
proper
employment
of
a
true
,
ancient
,
genuine
critic
:
 
which
be
,
to
travel
through
this
vast
world
of
writing
;
to
peruse
and
hunt
those
monstrous
fault
breed
within
them
;
to
drag
out
the
lurk
error
,
like
Cacus
from
his
den
;
to
multiply
them
like
Hydra
's
head
;
and
rake
them
together
like
Augeas
's
dung
;
or
else
to
drive
away
a
sort
of
dangerous
fowl
who
have
a
perverse
inclination
to
plunder
the
good
branch
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
,
like
those
stymphalian
bird
that
eat
up
the
fruit
.
  
<EOS>
these
reasoning
will
furnish
us
with
an
adequate
definition
of
a
true
critic
:
 
that
he
be
a
discoverer
and
collector
of
writer
'
fault
;
which
may
be
further
put
beyond
dispute
by
the
follow
demonstration
:
  
<EOS>
that
whoever
will
examine
the
writing
in
all
kind
wherewith
<EOS>
this
ancient
sect
hath
honour
the
world
,
shall
immediately
find
from
the
whole
thread
and
tenor
of
them
that
the
idea
of
the
author
have
be
altogether
conversant
and
take
up
with
the
fault
,
and
blemish
,
and
oversight
,
and
mistake
of
other
writer
,
and
let
the
subject
treat
on
be
whatever
it
will
,
their
imagination
be
so
entirely
possessed
and
replete
with
the
defect
of
other
pen
,
that
the
very
quintessence
of
what
be
bad
doe
of
necessity
distil
into
their
own
,
by
which
mean
the
whole
appear
to
be
nothing
else
but
an
abstract
of
the
criticism
themselves
have
make
.
  
<EOS>
have
thus
briefly
consider
the
original
and
office
of
a
critic
,
as
the
word
be
understand
in
its
most
noble
and
universal
acceptation
,
I
proceed
to
refute
the
objection
of
those
who
argue
from
the
silence
and
pretermission
of
author
,
by
which
they
pretend
to
prove
that
the
very
art
of
criticism
,
as
now
exercise
,
and
by
me
explain
,
be
wholly
modern
,
and
consequently
that
the
critic
of
Great
Britain
and
France
have
no
title
to
an
original
so
ancient
and
illustrious
as
I
have
deduce
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
if
I
can
clearly
make
out
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
the
most
ancient
writer
have
particularly
describe
both
the
person
and
the
office
of
a
true
critic
agreeable
to
the
definition
lay
down
by
me
,
their
grand
objection
 
from
the
silence
of
author
 
will
fall
to
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
I
confess
to
have
for
a
long
time
<EOS>
borne
a
part
in
this
general
error
,
from
which
I
should
never
have
acquit
myself
but
through
the
assistance
of
our
noble
modern
,
whose
most
edifying
volume
I
turn
indefatigably
over
night
and
day
,
for
the
improvement
of
my
mind
and
the
good
of
my
country
.
 
<EOS>
these
have
with
unwearied
pain
make
many
useful
search
into
the
weak
side
of
the
ancient
,
and
give
us
a
comprehensive
list
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
they
have
prove
beyond
contradiction
that
the
very
fine
thing
deliver
of
old
have
be
long
since
invent
and
bring
to
light
by
much
later
pen
,
and
that
the
noble
discoverie
those
ancient
ever
make
in
art
or
nature
have
all
be
produce
by
the
transcend
genius
of
the
present
age
,
which
clearly
show
how
little
merit
those
ancient
can
justly
pretend
to
,
and
take
off
that
blind
admiration
pay
them
by
man
in
a
corner
,
who
have
the
unhappiness
of
converse
too
little
with
present
thing
.
 
<EOS>
reflect
maturely
upon
all
this
,
and
take
in
the
whole
compass
of
human
nature
,
I
easily
conclude
that
these
ancient
,
highly
sensible
of
their
many
imperfection
,
must
need
have
endeavour
,
from
some
passage
in
their
work
,
to
obviate
,
soften
,
or
divert
the
censorious
reader
,
by
satire
or
panegyric
upon
the
true
critic
,
in
imitation
of
their
master
,
the
modern
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
in
the
commonplace
 
of
both
these
I
be
plentifully
instruct
by
a
long
course
of
useful
study
in
preface
and
prologue
,
and
therefore
immediately
resolve
to
try
what
I
could
discover
of
either
,
by
a
diligent
perusal
of
the
most
ancient
writer
,
and
especially
those
who
treat
of
the
early
time
.
  
<EOS>
here
I
find
,
to
my
great
surprise
,
that
although
they
all
enter
upon
occasion
into
particular
description
of
the
true
critic
,
accord
as
they
be
govern
by
their
fear
or
their
hope
,
yet
whatever
they
touch
of
that
kind
be
with
abundance
of
caution
,
adventure
no
further
than
mythology
and
hieroglyphic
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
I
suppose
,
give
ground
to
superficial
reader
for
urge
the
silence
of
author
against
the
antiquity
of
the
true
critic
,
though
the
type
be
so
apposite
,
and
the
application
so
necessary
and
natural
,
that
it
be
not
easy
to
conceive
how
any
reader
of
modern
eye
and
taste
could
overlook
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
venture
from
a
great
number
to
produce
a
few
which
I
be
very
confident
will
put
this
question
beyond
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
It
well
deserve
consider
that
these
ancient
writer
,
in
treat
enigmatically
upon
this
subject
,
have
generally
fix
upon
the
very
same
hieroglyph
,
vary
only
the
story
accord
to
their
affection
or
their
wit
.
 
<EOS>
for
first
,
Pausanias
be
of
opinion
that
the
perfection
of
write
correct
be
entirely
owing
to
the
institution
of
critic
,
and
that
he
can
possibly
mean
no
other
than
the
true
critic
be
,
I
think
,
manifest
enough
from
the
follow
description
.
 
<EOS>
He
say
they
be
a
race
of
man
who
delight
to
nibble
at
the
superfluity
and
excrescence
of
book
,
which
the
learn
at
length
observing
,
take
warning
of
their
own
accord
to
lop
the
luxuriant
,
the
rotten
,
the
dead
,
the
sapless
,
and
the
overgrown
branch
from
their
work
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
all
this
he
cunningly
shade
under
the
follow
allegory
:
 
<EOS>
that
the
Nauplians
in
Argia
learn
the
art
of
prune
their
vine
by
observe
that
when
an
ass
have
browse
upon
one
of
them
,
it
thrive
the
well
and
bore
fairer
fruit
.
 
<EOS>
but
Herodotus
hold
the
very
same
hieroglyph
,
speak
much
plainer
and
almost
in
terminis
.
 
<EOS>
He
hath
be
so
bold
as
to
tax
the
true
critic
of
ignorance
and
malice
,
tell
us
openly
,
for
I
think
nothing
can
be
plainer
,
that
in
the
western
part
of
Libya
there
be
ass
with
horn
,
upon
which
relation
<EOS>
Ctesias
 
yet
refine
,
mention
the
very
same
animal
about
India
;
add
,
that
whereas
all
other
ass
want
a
gall
,
these
horn
one
be
so
redundant
in
that
part
that
their
flesh
be
not
to
be
eat
because
of
its
extreme
bitterness
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
the
reason
why
those
ancient
writer
treat
this
subject
only
by
type
and
figure
be
because
they
durst
not
make
open
attack
against
a
party
so
potent
and
so
terrible
as
the
critic
of
those
age
be
,
<EOS>
whose
very
voice
be
so
dreadful
that
a
legion
of
author
would
tremble
and
drop
their
pen
at
the
sound
.
 
<EOS>
for
<EOS>
so
Herodotus
tell
us
expressly
in
another
place
how
a
vast
army
of
Scythians
be
put
to
flight
in
a
panic
terror
by
the
braying
of
an
ass
.
 
<EOS>
from
hence
it
be
conjecture
by
certain
profound
philologer
,
that
the
great
awe
and
reverence
pay
to
a
true
critic
by
the
writer
of
Britain
have
be
derive
to
us
from
those
our
scythian
ancestor
.
<EOS>
in
short
,
this
dread
be
so
universal
,
that
in
process
of
time
those
author
who
have
a
mind
to
publish
their
sentiment
more
freely
in
describe
the
true
critic
of
their
several
age
,
be
force
to
leave
off
the
use
of
the
former
hieroglyph
as
too
nearly
approach
the
prototype
,
and
invent
other
term
instead
thereof
that
be
more
cautious
and
mystical
.
 
<EOS>
so
Diodorus
,
speak
to
the
same
purpose
,
venture
no
farther
than
to
say
that
in
the
mountain
of
Helicon
there
grow
a
certain
weed
which
bear
a
flower
of
so
damned
a
scent
as
to
poison
those
who
offer
to
smell
it
.
 
<EOS>
Lucretius
give
exactly
the
same
relation
.
  
<EOS>
"
est
etiam
in
magnis
Heliconis
montibus
arbos
,
Floris
odore
hominem
retro
consueta
necare
.
"
 
<EOS>
Lib
.
<EOS>
6
.
   
<EOS>
but
Ctesias
,
whom
we
lately
quote
,
have
be
a
great
deal
bolder
;
he
have
be
use
with
much
severity
by
the
true
critic
of
his
own
age
,
and
therefore
could
not
forbear
to
leave
behind
him
at
least
one
deep
mark
of
his
vengeance
against
the
whole
tribe
.
 
<EOS>
His
meaning
be
so
near
the
surface
that
I
wonder
how
it
possibly
come
to
be
overlook
by
those
who
deny
the
antiquity
of
the
true
critic
.
 
<EOS>
for
pretend
to
make
a
description
of
many
strange
animal
about
India
,
he
have
set
down
these
remarkable
word
.
 
<EOS>
"
among
the
rest
,
"
say
he
,
"
there
be
a
serpent
that
want
tooth
,
and
consequently
can
not
bite
,
but
if
its
vomit
(
to
which
it
be
much
addict
)
happen
to
fall
upon
anything
,
a
certain
rottenness
or
corruption
ensue
.
<EOS>
these
serpent
be
generally
find
among
the
mountain
where
jewel
grow
,
and
they
frequently
emit
a
poisonous
juice
,
whereof
whoever
drink
,
that
person
's
brain
fly
out
of
his
nostril
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
also
among
the
ancient
a
sort
of
critic
,
not
distinguish
in
specie
from
the
former
but
in
growth
or
degree
,
who
seem
to
have
be
only
the
tiro
or
junior
scholar
,
yet
because
of
their
differ
employment
they
be
frequently
mention
as
a
sect
by
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
the
usual
exercise
of
these
young
student
be
to
attend
constantly
at
theatre
,
and
learn
to
spy
out
the
bad
part
of
the
play
,
whereof
they
be
oblige
carefully
to
take
note
,
and
render
a
rational
account
to
their
tutor
.
 
<EOS>
flesh
at
these
small
sport
,
like
young
wolf
,
they
grow
up
in
time
to
be
nimble
and
strong
enough
for
hunt
down
large
game
.
 
<EOS>
for
it
have
be
observe
,
both
among
ancient
and
modern
,
that
a
true
critic
have
one
quality
in
common
with
a
whore
and
an
alderman
,
never
to
change
his
title
or
his
nature
;
that
a
grey
critic
have
be
certainly
a
green
one
,
the
perfection
and
acquirement
of
his
age
be
only
the
improved
talent
of
his
youth
,
like
hemp
,
which
some
naturalist
inform
us
be
bad
for
suffocation
,
though
take
but
in
the
seed
.
 
<EOS>
I
esteem
the
invention
,
or
at
least
the
refinement
of
prologue
,
to
have
be
owe
to
these
young
proficient
,
of
whom
Terence
make
frequent
and
honourable
mention
,
under
the
name
of
Malevoli
.
  
<EOS>
now
it
be
certain
the
institution
of
the
true
critic
be
of
absolute
necessity
to
the
commonwealth
of
learn
.
 
<EOS>
for
all
human
action
seem
to
be
divide
like
themistocle
and
his
company
.
 
<EOS>
one
man
can
fiddle
,
and
another
can
make
a
small
town
a
great
city
;
and
he
that
can
not
do
either
one
or
the
other
deserve
to
be
kick
out
of
the
creation
.
 
<EOS>
the
avoiding
of
which
penalty
have
doubtless
give
the
first
birth
to
the
nation
of
critic
,
and
withal
an
occasion
for
their
secret
detractor
to
report
that
a
true
critic
be
a
sort
of
mechanic
set
up
with
a
stock
and
tool
for
his
trade
,
at
as
little
expense
as
a
tailor
;
and
that
there
be
much
analogy
between
the
utensil
and
ability
of
both
.
 
<EOS>
that
the
"
Tailor
's
Hell
"
be
the
type
of
a
critic
's
commonplace
-
book
,
and
his
wit
and
learning
hold
forth
by
the
goose
.
 
<EOS>
that
it
require
at
least
as
many
of
these
to
the
making
up
of
one
scholar
as
of
the
other
to
the
composition
of
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
that
the
valour
of
both
be
equal
,
and
their
weapon
near
of
a
size
.
 
<EOS>
much
may
be
say
in
answer
to
these
invidious
reflection
;
and
I
can
positively
affirm
the
first
to
be
a
falsehood
:
 
for
,
on
the
contrary
<EOS>
,
nothing
be
more
certain
than
that
it
require
great
laying
out
to
be
free
of
the
critic
's
company
than
of
any
other
you
can
name
.
 
<EOS>
for
as
to
be
a
true
beggar
,
it
will
cost
the
rich
candidate
every
groat
he
be
worth
,
so
before
one
can
commence
a
true
critic
,
it
will
cost
a
man
all
the
good
quality
of
his
mind
,
which
perhaps
for
a
less
purchase
would
be
think
but
an
indifferent
bargain
.
  
<EOS>
have
thus
amply
prove
the
antiquity
of
criticism
and
describe
the
primitive
state
of
it
,
I
shall
now
examine
the
present
condition
of
this
empire
,
and
show
how
well
it
agree
with
its
ancient
self
.
 
<EOS>
a
certain
author
,
whose
work
have
many
age
since
be
entirely
lose
,
do
in
his
fifth
book
and
eighth
chapter
say
of
critic
that
"
their
writing
be
the
mirror
of
learn
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
I
understand
in
a
literal
sense
,
and
suppose
our
author
must
mean
that
whoever
design
to
be
a
perfect
writer
must
inspect
into
the
book
of
critic
,
and
correct
his
invention
there
as
in
a
mirror
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
whoever
consider
that
the
mirror
of
the
ancient
be
make
of
brass
and
fine
mercurio
,
may
presently
apply
the
two
principal
qualification
of
a
true
modern
critic
,
and
consequently
must
needs
conclude
that
these
have
always
be
and
must
be
for
ever
the
same
.
<EOS>
for
brass
be
an
emblem
of
duration
,
and
when
it
be
skilfully
burnish
will
cast
reflection
from
its
own
superficie
without
any
assistance
of
mercury
from
behind
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
other
talent
of
a
critic
will
not
require
a
particular
mention
,
be
include
or
easily
deducible
to
these
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
shall
conclude
with
three
maxim
,
which
may
serve
both
as
characteristic
to
distinguish
a
true
modern
critic
from
a
pretender
,
and
will
be
also
of
admirable
use
to
those
worthy
spirit
who
engage
in
so
useful
and
honourable
an
art
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
be
,
that
criticism
,
contrary
to
all
other
faculty
of
the
intellect
,
be
ever
hold
the
true
and
good
when
it
be
the
very
first
result
of
the
critic
's
mind
;
as
fowler
reckon
the
first
aim
for
the
sure
,
and
seldom
fail
of
miss
the
mark
if
they
stay
not
for
a
second
.
  
<EOS>
secondly
,
the
true
critic
be
know
by
their
talent
of
swarm
about
the
noble
writer
,
to
which
they
be
carry
merely
by
instinct
,
as
a
rat
to
the
good
cheese
,
or
a
wasp
to
the
fair
fruit
.
 
<EOS>
so
when
the
king
be
a
horseback
he
be
sure
to
be
the
dirty
person
of
the
company
,
and
they
that
make
their
court
good
be
such
as
bespatter
him
most
.
  
<EOS>
lastly
,
a
true
critic
in
the
perusal
of
a
book
be
like
a
dog
at
a
feast
,
whose
thought
and
stomach
be
wholly
set
upon
what
the
guest
fle
away
,
and
consequently
be
apt
to
snarl
most
when
there
be
the
few
bone
.
  
<EOS>
thus
much
I
think
be
sufficient
to
serve
by
way
of
address
to
my
patron
,
the
true
modern
critic
,
and
may
very
well
atone
for
my
past
silence
,
as
well
as
that
which
I
be
like
to
observe
for
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
deserve
so
well
of
their
whole
body
as
to
meet
with
generous
and
tender
usage
at
their
hand
.
 
<EOS>
support
by
which
expectation
<EOS>
I
go
on
boldly
to
pursue
those
adventure
already
so
happily
begin
.
  
<EOS>
SECTION
IV
.
 
<EOS>
a
tale
of
a
tub
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
now
with
much
pain
and
study
conduct
the
reader
to
a
period
where
he
must
expect
to
hear
of
great
revolution
.
 
<EOS>
for
no
sooner
have
our
learn
brother
,
so
often
mention
,
get
a
warm
house
of
his
own
over
his
head
,
than
he
begin
to
look
big
and
to
take
mightily
upon
him
,
<EOS>
insomuch
that
unless
the
gentle
reader
out
of
his
great
candour
will
please
a
little
to
exalt
his
idea
,
I
be
afraid
he
will
henceforth
hardly
know
the
hero
of
the
play
when
he
happen
to
meet
him
,
his
part
,
his
dress
,
and
his
mien
be
so
much
alter
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
his
brother
he
would
have
them
to
know
that
he
be
their
elder
,
and
consequently
his
father
's
sole
heir
;
nay
,
a
while
after
,
he
would
not
allow
them
to
call
him
brother
,
but
Mr.
Peter
;
and
then
he
must
be
style
Father
Peter
,
and
sometimes
My
Lord
Peter
.
 
<EOS>
to
support
this
grandeur
,
which
he
soon
begin
to
consider
could
not
be
maintain
without
a
well
fonde
than
what
he
be
bear
to
,
after
much
thought
he
cast
about
at
last
to
turn
projector
and
virtuoso
,
wherein
he
so
well
succeed
,
that
many
famous
discovery
,
project
,
and
machine
which
bear
great
vogue
and
practice
at
present
in
the
world
,
be
owe
entirely
to
Lord
Peter
's
invention
.
<EOS>
I
will
deduce
the
good
account
I
have
be
able
to
collect
of
the
chief
amongst
them
,
without
consider
much
the
order
they
come
out
in
,
because
I
think
author
be
not
well
agree
as
to
that
point
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
when
this
treatise
of
mine
shall
be
translate
into
foreign
language
(
as
I
may
without
vanity
affirm
that
the
labour
of
collecting
,
the
faithfulness
in
recount
,
and
the
great
usefulness
of
the
matter
to
the
public
,
will
amply
deserve
that
justice
)
,
that
of
the
several
Academies
abroad
,
especially
those
of
France
and
Italy
,
will
favourably
accept
these
humble
offer
for
the
advancement
of
universal
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
also
advertise
the
most
reverend
father
<EOS>
the
eastern
missionary
that
I
have
purely
for
their
sake
make
use
of
such
word
and
phrase
as
will
best
admit
an
easy
turn
into
any
of
the
oriental
language
,
especially
the
Chinese
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
proceed
with
great
content
of
mind
upon
reflect
how
much
emolument
this
whole
globe
of
earth
be
like
to
reap
by
my
labour
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
undertaking
of
Lord
Peter
be
to
purchase
a
large
continent
,
lately
say
to
have
be
discover
in
Terra
Australis
incognita
.
 
<EOS>
this
tract
of
land
he
buy
at
a
very
great
pennyworth
from
the
discoverer
themselves
(
though
some
pretend
to
doubt
whether
they
have
ever
be
there
)
,
and
then
retail
it
into
several
canton
to
certain
dealer
,
who
carry
over
colony
,
but
be
all
shipwreck
in
the
voyage
;
upon
which
Lord
Peter
sell
the
say
continent
to
other
customer
again
and
again
,
and
again
and
again
,
with
the
same
success
.
  
<EOS>
the
second
project
I
shall
mention
be
his
sovereign
remedy
for
the
worm
,
especially
those
in
the
spleen
.
 
<EOS>
the
patient
be
to
eat
nothing
after
supper
for
three
night
;
as
soon
as
he
go
to
bed
,
he
be
carefully
to
lie
on
one
side
,
and
when
he
grow
weary
,
to
turn
upon
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
also
duly
confine
his
two
eye
to
the
same
object
,
and
by
no
means
break
wind
at
both
end
together
without
manif
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
these
prescription
diligently
observe
,
the
worm
would
void
insensibly
by
perspiration
ascend
through
the
brain
.
  
<EOS>
a
third
invention
be
the
erecting
of
a
whispering
-
office
for
the
public
good
and
ease
of
all
such
as
be
hypochondriacal
or
troubled
with
the
cholic
,
as
likewise
of
all
eavesdropper
,
physician
,
midwife
,
small
politician
,
friend
fall
out
,
repeat
poet
,
<EOS>
lover
happy
or
in
despair
,
bawd
,
privy

,

,
parasite
and
buffoon
,
in
short
,
of
all
such
as
be
in
danger
of
burst
with
too
much
wind
.
 
<EOS>
an
ass
's
head
be
place
so
conveniently
,
that
the
party
affect
may
easily
with
his
mouth
accost
either
of
the
animal
's
ear
,
which
he
be
to
apply
close
for
a
certain
space
,
and
by
a
fugitive
faculty
peculiar
to
the
ear
of
that
animal
,
receive
immediate
benefit
,
either
by
eructation
,
or
expiration
,
or
evomition
.
  
<EOS>
another
very
beneficial
project
of
Lord
Peter
's
be
an
office
of
insurance
for
tobacco
-
pipe
,
martyr
of
the
modern
zeal
,
volume
of
poetry
,
shadow
.
.

.
<EOS>
and
river
,
that
these
,
nor
any
of
these
,
shall
receive
damage
by
fire
.
 
<EOS>
from
whence
our
friendly
society
may
plainly
find
themselves
to
be
only
transcriber
from
this
original
,
though
the
one
and
the
other
have
be
of
great
benefit
to
the
undertaker
as
well
as
of
equal
to
the
public
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Peter
be
also
hold
the
original
author
of
puppet
and
raree
-
show
,
<EOS>
the
great
usefulness
whereof
be
so
generally
know
<EOS>
,
I
shall
not
enlarge
farther
upon
this
particular
.
  
<EOS>
but
another
discovery
for
which
he
be
much
renowned
be
his
famous
universal
pickle
.
 
<EOS>
for
have
remark
how
your
common
pickle
in
use
among
housewife
be
of
no
farther
benefit
than
to
preserve
dead
flesh
and
certain
kind
of
vegetable
,
Peter
with
great
cost
as
well
as
art
have
contrive
a
pickle
proper
for
house
,
garden
,
town
,
man
,
woman
,
child
,
and
cattle
,
wherein
he
could
preserve
them
as
sound
as
insect
in
amber
.
 
<EOS>
now
this
pickle
to
the
taste
,
the
smell
,
and
the
sight
,
appear
exactly
the
same
with
what
be
in
common
service
for
beef
,
and
butter
,
and
herring
(
and
have
be
often
that
way
apply
with
great
success
)
,
but
for
its
may
sovereign
virtue
be
quite
a
different
thing
.
 
<EOS>
for
Peter
would
put
in
a
certain
quantity
of
his
powder
pimperlim
-
pimp
,
after
which
it
never
fail
of
success
.
 
<EOS>
the
operation
be
perform
by
spargefaction
in
a
proper
time
of
the
moon
.
 
<EOS>
the
patient
who
be
to
be
pickle
,
if
it
be
a
house
,
would
infallibly
be
preserve
from
all
spider
,
rat
,
and
weasel
;
if
the
party
affect
be
a
dog
,
he
should
be
exempt
from
mange
,
and
madness
,
and
hunger
.
 
<EOS>
It
also
infallibly
take
away
all
scab
and
lice
,
and
scalle
head
from
child
,
never
hinder
the
patient
from
any
duty
,
either
at
bed
or
board
.
  
<EOS>
but
of
all
Peter
's
rarity
,
he
most
value
a
certain
set
of
bull
,
whose
race
be
by
great
fortune
preserve
in
a
lineal
descent
from
those
that
guard
the
golden
-
fleece
.
 
<EOS>
though
some
who
pretend
to
observe
them
curiously
doubt
the
breed
have
not
be
keep
entirely
chaste
,
because
they
have
degenerate
from
their
ancestor
in
some
quality
,
and
have
acquire
other
very
extraordinary
,
but
a
foreign
mixture
.
 
<EOS>
the
bull
of
Colchis
be
record
to
have
brazen
foot
;
but
whether
it
happen
by
ill
pasture
and
running
,
by
an
alloy
from
intervention
of
other
parent
from
steal
intrigue
;
whether
a
weakness
in
their
progenitor
have
impair
the
seminal
virtue
,
or
by
a
decline
necessary
through
a
long
course
of
time
,
the
original
of
nature
be
deprave
in
these
latter
sinful
age
of
the
world
  
<EOS>
whatever
be
the
cause
,
it
be
certain
that
Lord
Peter
's
bull
be
extremely
vitiate
by
the
rust
of
time
in
the
metal
of
their
foot
,
which
be
now
sink
into
common
lead
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
the
terrible
roar
peculiar
to
their
lineage
be
preserve
,
as
likewise
that
faculty
of
breathe
out
fire
from
their
nostril
;
which
notwithstanding
many
of
their
detractor
take
to
be
a
feat
of
art
,
and
to
be
nothing
so
terrible
as
it
appear
,
proceed
only
from
their
usual
course
of
diet
,
which
be
of
squibs
and
cracker
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
they
have
two
peculiar
mark
which
extremely
distinguish
them
from
the
bull
of
Jason
,
and
which
I
have
not
meet
together
in
the
description
of
any
other
monster
beside
that
in
.
 
<EOS>
horace
,
"
Varias
inducere
plumas
,
"
and
"
Atrum
definit
in
piscem
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
for
these
have
fish
tail
,
yet
upon
occasion
could
outfly
any
bird
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
Peter
put
these
bull
upon
several
employ
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
he
would
set
them
a
roaring
to
fright
naughty
boy
and
make
them
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
he
would
send
them
out
upon
errand
of
great
importance
,
where
it
be
wonderful
to
recount
,
and
perhaps
the
cautious
reader
may
think
much
to
believe
it
;
an
appetitus
sensibilis
derive
itself
through
the
whole
family
from
their
noble
ancestor
,
guardian
of
the
Golden
Fleece
,
they
continue
so
extremely
fond
of
gold
,
that
if
Peter
send
them
abroad
,
though
it
be
only
upon
a
compliment
,
they
would
roar
,
and
spit
,
and
belch
,
and
snivel
out
fire
,
and
keep
a
perpetual
coil
till
you
fling
them
a
bit
of
gold
;
but
then
pulveris
exigui
jactu
,
they
would
grow
calm
and
quiet
as
lamb
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
whether
by
secret
connivance
or
encouragement
from
their
master
,
or
out
of
their
own
liquorish
affection
to
gold
,
or
both
,
it
be
certain
they
be
no
well
than
a
sort
of
sturdy
,
swaggering
beggar
;
and
where
they
could
not
prevail
to
get
an
alm
,
would
make
woman
miscarry
and
child
fall
into
fit
;
who
to
this
very
day
usually
call
sprite
and
hobgoblin
by
the
name
of
bull
-
beggar
.
 
<EOS>
They
grow
at
last
so
very
troublesome
to
the
neighbourhood
,
that
some
gentleman
of
the
North
-
West
get
a
parcel
of
right
english
bull
-
dog
,
and
bait
them
so
terribly
,
that
they
feel
it
ever
after
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
needs
mention
one
more
of
Lord
Peter
's
project
,
which
be
very
extraordinary
,
and
discover
him
to
be
master
of
a
high
reach
and
profound
invention
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
it
happen
that
any
rogue
of
Newgate
be
condemn
to
be
hang
,
Peter
would
offer
him
a
pardon
for
a
certain
sum
of
money
,
which
when
the
poor
caitiff
have
make
all
shift
to
scrape
up
and
send
,
his
lordship
would
return
a
piece
of
paper
in
this
form

<EOS>
I
desire
of
those
whom
the
learn
among
posterity
will
appoint
for
commentator
upon
this
elaborate
treatise
,
that
they
will
proceed
with
great
caution
upon
certain
dark
point
,
wherein
all
who
be
not
vere
adepti
may
be
in
danger
to
form
rash
and
hasty
conclusion
,
especially
in
some
mysterious
paragraph
,
where
certain
arcana
be
join
for
brevity
sake
,
which
in
the
operation
must
be
divide

<EOS>
and
I
be
certain
that
future
son
of

will
return
large
thank
to
my
memory
for
so
grateful
,
so
useful
an
inmuendo

<EOS>
It
will
be
no
difficult
part
to
persuade
the
reader
that
so
many
worthy
discovery
meet
with
great
success
in
the
world
;
though
I
may
justly
assure
him
that
I
have
relate
much
the
small
number
;
my
design
have
be
only
to
single
out
such
as
will
be
of
most
benefit
for
public
imitation
,
or
which
best
serve
to
give
some
idea
of
the
reach
and
wit
of
the
inventor
.
 
<EOS>
and
therefore
it
nee
not
be
wonder
if
by
this
time
Lord
Peter
be
become
exceed
rich
.
 
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
he
have
keep
his
brain
so
long
and
so
violently
upon
the
rack
,
that
at
last
it
shake
itself
,
and
begin
to
turn
round
for
a
little
ease
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
what
with
pride
,
project
,
and
knavery
,
<EOS>
poor
Peter
be
grow
distract
,
and
conceive
the
strange
imagination
in

<EOS>
in
the
height
of
his
fit
(
as
it
be
usual
with
those
who
run
mad
out
of
pride
)
he
would
call
himself
God
Almighty
,
and
sometimes
monarch
of
the
universe
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
him
(
say
my
author
)
take
three
old
high
-
crown
hat
,
and
clap
them
all
on
his
head
,
three
storey
high
,
with
a
huge
bunch
of
key
at
his
girdle
,
and
an
angling
rod
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
in
which
guise
,
whoever
go
to
take
him
by
the
hand
in
the
way
of
salutation
,
Peter
with
much
grace
,
like
a
well
-
educate
spaniel
,
would
present
them
with
his
foot
,
and
if
they
refuse
his
civility
,
then
he
would
raise
it
as
high
as
their
chop
,
and
give
them
a
damned
kick
on
the
mouth
,
which
hath
ever
since
be
call
a
salute
.
 
<EOS>
whoever
walk
by
without
pay
him
their
compliment
,
have
a
wonderful
strong
breath
,
he
would
blow
their

off
into
the
dirt

<EOS>
meantime
his
affair
at
home
go
upside
down
,
and
his
two
brother
have
a
wretched
time
,
where
his
first
boutade
be
to
kick
both
their
wife
one
morning
out
of
door
,
and
his
own
too
,
and
in
their
stead
give
order
to
pick
up
the
first
three
stroller
could
be
meet
with
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
a
while
after
he
nail
up
the
cellar
door
,
and
would
not
allow
his
brother
a
drop
of
drink
to
their
victual

<EOS>
dine
one
day
at
an
alderman

in

city

,
Peter
observe
him
expatiate
,
after
the
manner
of
his
brother
in
the
praise
of
his
sirloin
of
beef

Beef

"
say
the

<EOS>
when
Peter
come

he
would
need
take
the
fancy

cook
up
this
doctrine
into
use

apply
the

carve
out

Peter
,
appear
in
great
surprise
,
"
I
do
not
comprehend
this
at
all
;
"
upon
which
the
young
,
interpose
to
set
the
business
right
<EOS>
,
"
My
Lord
,
"
say
he
,
"
my
brother
,
I
suppose
,
be
hungry
,
and
long
for
the
mutton
your
lordship
hath
promise
us
to
dinner
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Pray
,
"
say
Peter
,
"
take
me
along
with
you
,
either
you
be
both
mad
,
or
dispose
to
be
merry
than
I
approve
of
;
if
you
there
do
not
like
your
piece
,
I
will
carve
you
another
,
though
I
should
take
that
to
be
the
choice
bit
of
the
whole
shoulder

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
then
,
my
Lord
?
"
reply
the
first
;
"
it
seem
this
be
a
shoulder
of
mutton
all
this
while
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
sir
,
"
say
Peter
,
"
eat
your
victual
and
leave
off
your
impertinence
,
if
you
please
,
for
I
be
not
dispose
to
relish
it
at
present
;
"
but
the
other
could
not
forbear
,
be
over
-
provoke
at
the
affected
seriousness
of
Peter
's
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
Lord
,
"
say
he
,
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
say
,
that
to
my
eye
and
finger
,
and
tooth
and
nose
,
it
seem
to
be
nothing
but
a
crust
of
bread
.
"
 
<EOS>
upon
which
the
second
put
in
his
word
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
see
a
piece
of
mutton
in
my
life
so
nearly
resemble
a
slice
from
a
twelve
-
penny
loaf
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
look
ye
,
gentleman

"
cry
Peter
in
a
rage
,
"
to
convince
you
what
a
couple
of
blind
,
positive
,
ignorant
,
wilful
puppy
you
be
,
I
will
use
but
<EOS>
this
plain
argument
;
by
g
#
#
#
#
,
it
be
true
,
good
,
natural
mutton
as
any
in
Leadenhall
Market
;

#
confound
<EOS>
you
both
eternally
if
you
offer
to
believe
otherwise

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
such
a
thunder
proof
as
this
leave
no
further
room
for
objection
<EOS>
;
the
two
unbeliever
begin
to
gather
and
pocket
up
their
mistake
as
hastily
as
they
could
.
 
<EOS>
"
why
,
truly
,
"
say
the
first
,
"
upon
more
mature
consideration
"
 
<EOS>
"
ay
,
"
say
the
other
,
interrupt
him
,
"
now
I
have
think
better
on
the
thing
,
your
lordship
seem
to
have
a
great
deal
of
reason
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
very
well
,
"
say
Peter
.
 
<EOS>
"
here
,
boy
,
fill
me
a
beer
-
glass
of
claret
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
to
you
both
with
all
my
heart

"
 
<EOS>
the
two
brother
,
much
delighted
to
see
him
so
readily
appease
,
return
their
most
humble
thank
,
and
say
they
would
be
glad
to
pledge
his
lordship
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
you
shall
,
"
say
Peter
,
"
I
be
not
a
person
to
refuse
you
anything
that
be
reasonable
;
wine
moderately
take
be
a
cordial
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
a
glass
apiece
for
you
;
it
be
true
natural
juice
from
the
grape
;
none
of
your
damned
vintner
's
brewing
.
"
 
<EOS>
have
speak
thus
,
he
present
to
each
of
them
another
large
dry
crust
,
bid
them
drink
it
off
,
and
not
be
bashful
,
for
it
would
do
them
<EOS>
no
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
brother
,
after
have
perform
the
usual
office
in
such
delicate
conjuncture
,
of
stare
a
sufficient
period
at
Lord
Peter
and
each
other
,
and
find
how
matter
be
like
to
go
,
resolve
not
to
enter
on
a
new
dispute
,
but
let
him
carry
the
point
as
he
please
;
for
he
be
now
get
into
one
of
his
mad
fit
,
and
to
argue
or
expostulate
further
would
only
serve
to
render
him
a
hundred
time
more
untractable
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
choose
to
relate
this
worthy
matter
in
all
its
circumstance
,
because
it
give
a
principal
occasion
to
that
great
and
famous
rupture
 
which
happen
about
the
same
time
among
these
brother
,
and
be
never
afterwards
make
up
.
 
<EOS>
but
of
that
I
shall
treat
at
large
in
another
section
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
certain
that
Lord
Peter
,
even
in
his
lucid
interval
,
be
very
lewdly
give
in
his
common
conversation
,
extreme
wilful
and
positive
,
and
would
at
any
time
rather
argue
to
the
death
than
allow
himself
to
be
once
in
an
error
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
he
have
an
abominable
faculty
of
tell
huge
palpable
lie
upon
all
occasion
,
and
swear
not
only
to
the
truth
,
but
curse
the
whole
company
to
hell
if
they
pretend
to
make
the
least
scruple
of
believe
him
.
<EOS>
one
time
he
swear
he
have
a
cow
at
home
which
give
as
much
milk
at
a
meal
as
would
fill
three
thousand
church
,
and
what
be
yet
more
extraordinary
,
would
never
turn
sour
.
 
<EOS>
another
time
he
be
tell
of
an
old
sign
-
post
 
that
belong
to
his
father
,
with
nail
and
timber
enough
on
it
to
build
sixteen
large
man
-
of
-
war
.
 
<EOS>
talk
one
day
of
chinese
waggon
,
which
be
make
so
light
as
to
sail
over
mountain
,
"
z####nd
,
"
say
Peter
,
"
<EOS>
where
be
the
wonder
of
that
?
 
<EOS>
by
g
#
#
#
#
,
I
see
a
large
house
of
lime
and
stone
travel
over
sea
and
land
(
grant
that
it
stop
sometimes
to
bait
)
above
two
thousand
german
league
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
that
which
be
the
good
of
it
,
he
would
swear
desperately
all
the
while
that
he
never
tell
a
lie
in
his
life
,
and
at
every
word
:
 
"
<EOS>
by

gentleman
,
I
tell
you
nothing
but
the
truth
,
and
the
d####l
broil
them
eternally
that
will
not
believe
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
short
,
Peter
grow
so
scandalous
that
all
the
neighbourhood
begin
in
plain
word
to
say
he
be
no
well
than
a
knave
;
and
his
two
brother
,
long
weary
of
his
ill
-
usage
,
resolve
at
last
to
leave
him
;
but
first
they
humbly
desire
a
copy
of
their
father
's
will
,
which
have
now
lie
by
neglect
time
out
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
instead
of
grant
this
request
,
he
call
them
rogue
,
traitor
,
and
the
rest
of
the
vile
name
he
could
muster
up
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
while
he
be
abroad
one
day
upon
his
project
,
the
two
youngster
watch
their
opportunity
,
make
a
shift
to
come
at
the
will
,
and
take
a
copia
vera
,
by
which
they
presently
see
how
grossly
they
have
be
abuse
,
their
father
have
leave
them
equal
heir
,
and
strictly
command
that
whatever
they
got
should
lie
in
common
among
them
all
.
<EOS>
pursuant
to
which
,
their
next
enterprise
be
to
break
open
the
cellar
-
door
and
get
a
little
good
drink
to
spirit
and
comfort
their
heart
.
 
<EOS>
in
copy
the
will
,
they
have
meet
another
precept
against
whoring
,
divorce
,
and
separate
maintenance
;
upon
which
,
their
next
work
be
to
discard
their
concubine
and
send
for
their
wife
.
 
<EOS>
whilst
all
this
be
in
agitation
,
there
enter
a
solicitor
from
Newgate
,
desire
Lord
Peter
would
please
to
procure
a
pardon
for
a
thief
that
be
to
be
hang
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
two
brother
tell
him
he
be
a
coxcomb
to
seek
pardon
from
a
fellow
who
deserve
to
be
hang
much
better
than
his
client
,
and
discover
all
the
method
of
that
imposture
in
the
same
form
I
deliver
it
a
while
ago
,
advise
the
solicitor
to
put
his
friend
upon
obtain
a
pardon
from
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
all
this
platter
and
revolution
in
come
Peter
with
a
file
of
dragoon
at
his
heel
,
and
gather
from
all
hand
<EOS>
what
be
in
the
wind
,
he
and
his
gang
,
after
several
million
of
scurrility
and
curse
not
very
important
here
to
repeat
,
by
main
force
very
fairly
kick
them
both
out
of
door

would
never
let

come
under
his
roof

that
day

<EOS>
V.
 
a
digression
in
the
modern
kind
.
  
<EOS>
We
whom
the
world
be
pleased
to
honour
with
the
title
of
modern
author
,
should
never
have
be
able
to
compass
our
great
design
of
an
everlasting
remembrance
and
never
-
die
fame
if
our
endeavour
have
not
be
so
highly
serviceable
to
the
general
good
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
this
,
o
universe
!
<EOS>
be
the
adventurous
attempt
of
me
,
thy
secretary
        
"
Quemvis
perferre
laborem
Suadet
,
et
inducit
nocte
vigilare
serena
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
to
this
end
I
have
some
time
since
,
with
a
world
of
pain
and
art
,
dissect
the
carcass
of
human
nature
,
and
read
many
useful
lecture
upon
the
several
part
,
both
contain
and
contain
,
till
at
last
it
smell
so
strong
<EOS>
I
could
preserve
it
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
upon
which
I
have
be
at
a
great
expense
to
fit
up
all
the
bone
with
exact
contexture
and
in
due
symmetry
,
so
that
I
be
ready
to
show
a
very
complete
anatomy
thereof
to
all
curious
gentleman
and
other
.
 
<EOS>
but
not
to
digress
further
in
the
midst
of
a
digression
,
as
I
have
know
some
author
<EOS>
enclose
digression
in
one
another
like
a
nest
of
box
,
I
do
affirm
that
,
have
carefully
cut
up
human
nature
<EOS>
,
I
have
find
a
very
strange
,
new
,
and
important
discovery
:
 
that
the
public
good
of
mankind
be
perform
by
two
way
 
instruction
and
diversion
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
further
prove
my
say
several
reading
(
which
,
perhaps
,
the
world
may
one
day
see
,
if
I
can
prevail
on
any
friend
to
steal
a
copy
,
or
on
certain
gentleman
of
my
admirer
to
be
very
importunate
)
<EOS>
that
,
as
mankind
be
now
disposed
,
he
receive
much
great
advantage
by
be
divert
than
instruct
,
his
epidemical
disease
be
fastidiosity
,
amorphy
,
and
oscitation
;
whereas
,
in
the
present
universal
empire
of
wit
and
learning
,
there
seem
but
little
matter
leave
for
instruction
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
in
compliance
with
a
lesson
of
great
age
and
authority
,
I
have
attempt
carry
the
point
in
all
its
height
,
and
accordingly
throughout
this
divine
treatise
have
skilfully
knead
up
both
together
with
a
layer
of
utile
and
a
layer
of
dulce
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
consider
how
exceedingly
our
illustrious
modern
have
eclipse
the
weak
glimmering
light
of
the
ancient
,
and
turn
them
out
of
the
road
of
all
fashionable
commerce
to
a
degree
that
our
choice
town
wit
of
most
refined
accomplishment
be
in
grave
dispute
whether
there
have
be
ever
any
ancient
or
no
;
in
which
point
we
be
like
to
receive
wonderful
satisfaction
from
the
most
useful
labour
and
lucubration
of
that
worthy
modern
,
Dr.
Bentley
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
when
I
consider
all
this
,
I
can
not
but
bewail
that
no
famous
modern
hath
ever
yet
attempt
an
universal
system
in
a
small
portable
volume
of
all
thing
that
be
to
be
know
,
or
believe
,
or
imagine
,
or
practise
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
,
however
,
force
to
acknowledge
that
such
an
enterprise
be
think
on
some
time
ago
by
a
great
philosopher
of
O
-
Brazile
.
 
<EOS>
the
method
he
propose
be
by
a
certain
curious
receipt
,
a
nostrum
,
which
after
his
untimely
death
I
find
among
his
paper
,
and
do
here
,
out
of
my
great
affection
to
the
modern
learn
,
present
them
with
it
,
not
doubt
it
may
one
day
encourage
some
worthy
undertaker
.
  
<EOS>
You
take
fair
correct
copy
,
well
bind
in
calf
's
skin
and
letter
at
the
back
,
of
all
modern
body
of
art
and
science
whatsoever
,
and
in
what
language
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
these
you
distil
in
balneo
Mariae
,
infuse
quintessence
of
poppy
Q.S.
,
together
with
three
pint
of
lethe
,
to
be
have
from
the
apothecary
.
 
<EOS>
You
cleanse
away
carefully
the
sorde
and
caput
mortuum
,
let
all
that
be
volatile
evaporate
.
 
<EOS>
You
preserve
only
the
first
running
,
which
be
again
to
be
distil
seventeen
time
,
<EOS>
till
what
remain
will
amount
to
about
two
dram
.
 
<EOS>
this
you
keep
in
a
glass
vial
hermetically
seal
for
one
-
and
-
twenty
day
.
 
<EOS>
then
you
begin
your
catholic
treatise
,
take
every
morning
fast
(
first
shake
the
vial
)
<EOS>
three
drop
of
this
elixir
,
snuff
it
strongly
up
your
nose
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
dilate
itself
about
the
brain
(
where
there
be
any
)
in
fourteen
minute
,
and
you
immediately
perceive
in
your
head
an
infinite
number
of
abstract
,
summary
,
compendium
,
extract
,
collection
,
medulla
,
excerpta
quaedams
,
florilegias
and
the
like
,
all
dispose
into
great
order
and
reducible
upon
paper
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
needs
own
<EOS>
it
be
by
the
assistance
of
this
arcanum
that
I
,
though
otherwise
impar
,
have
adventure
upon
so
dare
an
attempt
,
never
achieve
or
undertake
before
but
by
a
certain
author
call
Homer
,
<EOS>
in
whom
,
though
otherwise
a
person
not
without
some
ability
,
and
for
an
ancient
of
a
tolerable
genius
;
I
have
discover
many
gross
error
which
be
not
to
be
forgive
his
very
ashe
,
if
by
chance
any
of
them
be
leave
.
 
<EOS>
for
whereas
we
be
assure
he
design
his
work
for
a
complete
body
of
all
knowledge
,
human
,
divine
,
political
,
and
mechanic
<EOS>
,
it
be
manifest
he
hath
wholly
neglect
some
,
and
be
very
imperfect
perfect
in
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
first
of
all
,
as
eminent
a
cabalist
as
his
disciple
would
represent
him
,
his
account
of
the
opus
magnum
be
extremely
poor
and
deficient
;
he
seem
to
have
read
but
very
superficially
either
Sendivogus
,
Behmen
,
or
Anthroposophia
Theomagica
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
also
quite
mistaken
about
the
sphaera
pyroplastica
,
a
neglect
not
to
be
atone
for
,
and
(
if
the
reader
will
admit
so
severe
a
censure
)
<EOS>
vix
crederem
autorem
hunc
unquam
audivisse
ignis
vocem
.
 
<EOS>
His
failing
be
not
less
prominent
in
several
part
of
the
mechanic
.
<EOS>
for
have
read
his
writing
with
the
utmost
application
usual
among
modern
wit
,
I
could
never
yet
discover
the
least
direction
about
the
structure
of
that
useful
instrument
a
save
-
all
;
for
want
of
which
,
if
the
modern
have
not
lend
their
assistance
,
we
may
yet
have
wander
in
the
dark
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
still
behind
a
fault
far
more
notorious
to
tax
this
author
with
;
I
mean
his
gross
ignorance
in
the
common
law
of
this
realm
,
and
in
the
doctrine
as
well
as
discipline
of
the
Church
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
a
defect
,
indeed
,
for
which
both
he
and
all
the
ancient
stand
most
justly
censure
by
my
worthy
and
ingenious
friend
Mr.
Wotton
,
Bachelor
of
Divinity
,
in
his
incomparable
treatise
of
ancient
and
modern
learning
;
a
book
never
to
be
sufficiently
value
,
whether
we
consider
the
happy
turn
and
flowing
of
the
author
's
wit
,
the
great
usefulness
of
his
sublime
discovery
upon
the
subject
of
fly
and
spittle
,
or
the
laborious
eloquence
of
his
style
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
can
not
forbear
do
that
author
the
justice
of
my
public
acknowledgment
for
the
great
help
and
<EOS>
lifting
I
have
out
of
his
incomparable
piece
while
I
be
pen
this
treatise
.
  
<EOS>
but
besides
these
omission
in
Homer
already
mention
,
the
curious
reader
will
also
observe
several
defect
in
that
author
's
writing
for
which
he
be
not
altogether
so
accountable
.
 
<EOS>
for
whereas
every
branch
of
knowledge
have
receive
such
wonderful
acquirement
since
his
age
,
especially
within
these
last
three
year
or
thereabout
,
it
be
almost
impossible
he
could
be
so
very
perfect
in
modern
discovery
as
his
advocate
pretend
.
 
<EOS>
We
freely
acknowledge
him
to
be
the
inventor
of
the
compass
,
of
gunpowder
,
and
the
circulation
of
the
blood
;
but
I
challenge
any
of
his
admirer
to
show
me
in
all
his
writing
a
complete
account
of
the
spleen
.
 
<EOS>
do
he
not
also
leave
us
wholly
to
seek
in
the
art
of
political
wagering
?
 
<EOS>
what
can
be
more
defective
and
unsatisfactory
than
his
long
dissertation
upon
tea
?
<EOS>
and
as
to
his
method
of
salivation
without
mercury
,
so
much
celebrate
of
late
,
it
be
to
my
own
knowledge
and
experience
a
thing
very
little
to
be
rely
on
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
to
supply
such
momentous
defect
that
I
have
be
prevail
on
,
after
long
solicitation
,
to
take
pen
in
hand
,
and
I
dare
venture
to
promise
the
judicious
reader
<EOS>
shall
find
nothing
neglect
here
that
can
be
of
use
upon
any
emergency
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
confident
to
have
include
and
exhaust
all
that
human
imagination
can
rise
or
fall
to
.
 
<EOS>
particularly
I
recommend
to
the
perusal
of
the
learn
certain
discovery
that
be
wholly
untouched
by
other
<EOS>
,
whereof
I
shall
only
mention
,
among
a
great
many
more
,
my
"
New
Help
of
Smatterers
,
or
the
art
of
be
Deep
Learned
and
Shallow
Read
,
"
"
a
curious
invention
about
mouse
-
trap
,
"
"
a

,
or
every
man
his
own
carver
,
"
together
with
a
most
useful
engine
for
catching
of
owl
.
 
<EOS>
all
which
the
judicious
reader
will
find
largely
treat
on
in
the
several
part
of
this
discourse
.
  
<EOS>
I
hold
myself
oblige
to
give
as
much
light
as
possible
into
the
beauty
and
excellence
of
what
I
be
write
,
because
it
be
become
the
fashion
and
humour
most
applaud
among
the
first
author
of
this
polite
and
learn
age
,
when
they
would
correct
the
ill
nature
of
critical
or
inform
the
ignorance
of
courteous
reader
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
there
have
be
several
famous
piece
lately
publish
,
both
in
verse
and
prose
,
wherein
if
the
writer
have
not
be
pleased
,
out
of
their
great
humanity
and
affection
to
the
public
,
to
give
us
a
nice
detail
of
the
sublime
and
the
admirable
they
contain
,
it
be
a
thousand
to
one
whether
we
should
ever
have
discover
one
grain
of
either
.
 
<EOS>
for
my
own
particular
,
I
can
not
deny
that
whatever
I
have
say
upon
this
occasion
have
be
more
proper
in
a
preface
,
and
more
agreeable
to
the
mode
which
usually
direct
it
there
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
here
think
fit
to
lay
hold
on
that
great
and
honourable
privilege
of
be
the
last
writer
.
 
<EOS>
I
claim
an
absolute
authority
in
right
as
the
fresh
modern
,
which
give
me
a
despotic
power
over
all
author
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
strength
of
which
title
I
do
utterly
disapprove
and
declare
against
that
pernicious
custom
of
make
the
preface
a
bill
of
fare
to
the
book
.
 
<EOS>
for
I
have
always
look
upon
it
as
a
high
point
of
indiscretion
in
monstermonger
and
other
retailer
of
strange
sight
to
hang
out
a
fair
large
picture
over
the
door
,
draw
after
the
life
,
with
a
most
eloquent
description
underneath
.
 
<EOS>
this
have
save
me
many
a
threepence
,
for
my
curiosity
be
fully
satisfied
,
and
I
never
offer
to
go
in
,
though
often
invite
by
the
urge
and
attend
orator
with
his
last
move
and
stand
piece
of
rhetoric
,
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
upon
my
word
,
we
be
just
go
to
begin
.
"
 
<EOS>
such
be
exactly
the
fate
at
this
time
of
Prefaces
,
Epistles
,
Advertisements
,
Introductions
,
Prolegomenas
,
Apparatuses
,
to
the
Readers
's
.
 
<EOS>
this
expedient
be
admirable
at
first
;
our
great
Dryden
have
long
carry
it
as
far
as
it
would
go
,
and
with
incredible
success
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
often
say
to
me
in
confidence
that
the
world
would
never
have
suspect
him
to
be
so
great
a
poet
if
he
have
not
assure
them
so
frequently
in
his
preface
,
that
it
be
impossible
they
could
either
doubt
or
forget
it
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
it
may
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
much
fear
his
instruction
have
edify
out
of
their
place
,
and
teach
man
to
grow
wise
in
certain
point
where
he
never
intend
they
should
;
for
it
be
lamentable
to
behold
with
what
a
lazy
scorn
many
of
the
yawn
reader
in
our
age
do
now
-
a
-
day
twirl
over
forty
or
fifty
page
of
preface
and
dedication
(
which
be
the
usual
modern
stint
)
,
as
if
it
be
so
much
latin
.
 
<EOS>
though
it
must
be
also
allow
,
on
the
other
hand
,
that
a
very
considerable
number
be
know
to
proceed
critic
and
wit
by
read
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
into
which
two
faction
<EOS>
I
think
all
present
reader
may
justly
be
divide
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
for
myself
,
I
profes
to
be
of
the
former
sort
,
and
therefore
have
the
modern
inclination
to
expatiate
upon
the
beauty
of
my
own
production
,
and
display
the
bright
part
of
my
discourse
,
I
think
best
to
do
it
in
the
body
of
the
work
,
where
as
it
now
lie
it
make
a
very
considerable
addition
to
the
bulk
of
the
volume
,
a
circumstance
by
no
means
to
be
neglect
by
a
skilful
writer
.
  
<EOS>
have
thus
pay
my
due
deference
and
acknowledgment
to
an
establish
custom
of
our
new
author
,
by
a
long
digression
unsought
for
and
a
universal
censure
unprovoke
,
by
force
into
the
light
,
with
much
pain
and
dexterity
,
my
own
excellence
and
other
man
's
default
,
with
great
justice
to
myself
and
candour
to
them
,
I
now
happily
resume
my
subject
,
to
the
infinite
satisfaction
both
of
the
reader
and
the
author

SECTION
VI
.
 
<EOS>
a
tale
of
a
tub
.
  
<EOS>
We
leave
Lord
Peter
in
open
rupture
with
his
two
brother
,
both
for
ever
discard
from
his
house
,
and
resign
to
the
wide
world
with
little
or
nothing
to
trust
to
.
 
<EOS>
which
be
circumstance
that
render
them
proper
subject
for
the
charity
of
a
writer
's
pen
to
work
on
,
scene
of
misery
ever
afford
the
fair
harvest
for
great
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
this
the
world
may
perceive
the
difference
between
the
integrity
of
a
generous
author
and
that
of
a
common
friend
.
 
<EOS>
the
latter
be
observe
to
adhere
close
in
prosperity
,
but
on
the
decline
of
fortune
to
drop
suddenly
off
;
whereas
the
generous
author
,
just
on
the
contrary
,
find
his
hero
on
the
dunghill
,
from
thence
,
by
gradual
step
,
raise
him
to
a
throne
,
and
then
immediately
withdraw
,
expect
not
so
much
as
thank
for
his
pain
;
in
imitation
of
which
example
I
have
place
Lord
Peter
in
a
noble
house
,
<EOS>
give
him
a
title
to
wear
and
money
to
spend
.
 
<EOS>
there
I
shall
leave
him
for
some
time
,
return
,
where
common
charity
direct
me
,
to
the
assistance
of
his
two
brother
at
their
low
ebb
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
shall
by
no
mean
<EOS>
forget
my
character
of
a
historian
,
to
follow
the
truth
step
by
step
whatever
happen
,
or
wherever
it
may
lead
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
exile
so
nearly
unite
in
fortune
and
interest
take
a
lodging
together
,
where
at
their
first
leisure
they
begin
to
reflect
on
the
numberless
misfortune
and
vexation
of
their
life
past
,
and
could
not
tell
of
the
sudden
to
what
failure
in
their
conduct
they
ought
to
impute
them
,
when
,
after
some
recollection
,
they
call
to
mind
the
copy
of
their
father
's
will
which
they
have
so
happily
recover
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
immediately
produce
,
and
a
firm
resolution
take
between
them
to
alter
whatever
be
already
amiss
,
and
reduce
all
their
future
measure
to
the
strict
obedience
prescribe
therein
.
 
<EOS>
the
main
body
of
the
will
(
as
the
reader
can
not
easily
have
forget
)
consist
in
certain
admirable
rule
,
about
the
wearing
of
their
coat
<EOS>
,
in
the
perusal
whereof
the
two
brother
at
every
period
duly
compare
the
doctrine
with
the
practice
,
there
be
never
see
a
wide
difference
between
two
thing
,
horrible
downright
transgression
of
every
point
.
 
<EOS>
upon
which
they
both
resolve
without
further
delay
to
fall
immediately
upon
reduce
the
whole
exactly
after
their
father
's
model
.
  
<EOS>
but
here
it
be
good
to
stop
the
hasty
reader
,
ever
impatient
to
see
the
end
of
an
adventure
before
we
writer
can
duly
prepare
him
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
to
record
that
these
two
brother
begin
to
be
distinguish
at
this
time
by
certain
name
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
them
desire
to
be
call
Martin
,
and
the
other
take
the
appellation
of
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
these
two
have
live
in
much
friendship
and
agreement
under
the
tyranny
of
their
brother
Peter
,
as
it
be
the
talent
of
fellow
-
sufferer
to
do
,
man
in
misfortune
be
like
man
in
the
dark
,
to
whom
all
colour
be
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
they
come
forward
into
the
world
,
and
begin
to
display
themselves
to
each
other
and
to
the
light
,
their
complexion
appear
extremely
different
,
which
the
present
posture
of
their
affair
give
them
sudden
opportunity
to
discover
.
  
<EOS>
but
here
the
severe
reader
may
justly
tax
me
as
a
writer
of
short
memory
,
a
deficiency
to
which
a
true
modern
<EOS>
can
not
but
of
necessity
be
a
little
subject
.
 
<EOS>
because
,
memory
be
an
employment
of
the
mind
upon
thing
past
,
be
a
faculty
for
which
the
learn
in
our
illustrious
age
have
no
manner
of
occasion
,
who
deal
entirely
with
invention
and
strike
all
thing
out
of
themselves
,
or
at
least
by
collision
from
each
other
;
upon
which
account
,
we
think
it
highly
reasonable
to
produce
our
great
forgetfulness
as
an
argument
unanswerable
for
our
great
wit
.
 
<EOS>
I
ought
in
method
to
have
inform
the
reader
about
fifty
page
ago
of
a
fancy
Lord
Peter
take
,
and
infuse
into
his
brother
,
to
wear
on
their
coat
whatever
trimming
come
up
in
fashion
,
never
pull
off
any
as
they
go
out
of
the
mode
,
but
keep
on
all
together
,
which
amount
in
time
to
a
medley
the
most
antic
you
can
possibly
conceive
,
and
this
to
a
degree
that
,
upon
the
time
of
their
fall
out
,
there
be
hardly
a
thread
of
the
original
coat
to
be
see
,
but
an
infinite
quantity
of
lace
,
and
ribband
,
and
fringe
,
and
embroidery
,
and
point
(
I
mean
only
those
tag
with
silver
,
for
the
rest
fall
off
)
.
 
<EOS>
now
this
material
circumstance
have
be
forget
in
due
place
,
as
good
fortune
hath
order
,
come
in
very
properly
here
,
when
the
two
brother
be
just
go
to
reform
their
vesture
into
the
primitive
state
prescribe
by
their
father
's
will
.
  
<EOS>
They
both
unanimously
enter
upon
this
great
work
,
look
sometimes
on
their
coat
and
sometimes
on
the
will
.
 
<EOS>
Martin
lay
the
first
hand
;
at
one
twitch
bring
off
a
large
handful
of
point
,
and
with
a
second
pull
strip
away
ten
dozen
yard
of
fringe
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
he
have
go
thus
far
he
demur
a
while
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
very
well
<EOS>
there
yet
remain
a
great
deal
more
to
be
do
;
however
,
the
first
heat
be
over
,
his
violence
begin
to
cool
,
and
he
resolve
to
proceed
more
moderately
in
the
rest
of
the
work
,
have
already
very
narrowly
escape
a
swinging
rent
in
pull
off
the
point
,
which
be
tag
with
silver
(
as
we
have
observe
before
)
,
the
judicious
workman
have
with
much
sagacity
double
sew
to
preserve
them
from
fall
.
 
<EOS>
resolve
therefore
to
rid
his
coat
of
a
huge
quantity
of
gold
lace
,
he
pick
up
the
stitch
with
much
caution
and
diligently
glean
out
all
the
loose
thread
as
he
go
,
which
prove
to
be
a
work
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
fall
about
the
embroidered
indian
figure
of
man
,
woman
,
and
child
,
against
which
,
as
you
have
hear
in
its
due
place
,
their
father
's
testament
be
extremely
exact
and
severe
.
 
<EOS>
these
,
with
much
dexterity
and
application
,
be
after
a
while
quite
eradicated
or
utterly
deface
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
rest
,
where
he
observe
the
embroidery
to
be
work
so
close
as
not
to
be
get
away
without
damage
the
cloth
,
or
where
it
serve
to
hide
or
strengthen
any
flaw
in
the
body
of
the
coat
,
contract
by
the
perpetual
tampering
of
workman
upon
it
,
he
conclude
the
wise
course
be
to
let
it
remain
,
resolve
in
no
case
whatsoever
that
the
substance
of
the
stuff
should
suffer
injury
,
which
he
think
the
good
method
for
serve
the
true
intent
and
meaning
of
his
father
's
will
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
be
the
near
account
I
have
be
able
to
collect
of
Martin
's
proceeding
upon
this
great
revolution
.
  
<EOS>
but
his
brother
Jack
,
whose
adventure
will
be
so
extraordinary
as
to
furnish
a
great
part
in
the
remainder
of
this
discourse
,
enter
upon
the
matter
with
other
thought
and
a
quite
different
spirit
.
<EOS>
for
the
memory
of
Lord
Peter
's
injury
produce
a
degree
of
hatred
and
spite
which
have
a
much
great
share
of
incite
him
than
any
regard
after
his
father
's
command
,
since
these
appear
at
best
only
secondary
and
subservient
to
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
for
this
medley
of
humour
he
make
a
shift
to
find
a
very
plausible
name
,
honour
it
with
the
title
of
zeal
,
which
be
,
perhaps
,
the
most
significant
word
that
have
be
ever
yet
produce
in
any
language
,
as
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
I
have
fully
prove
in
my
excellent
analytical
discourse
upon
that
subject
,
wherein
I
have
deduce
a
histori
-
theo-
physiological
account
of
zeal
,
show
how
it
first
proceed
from
a
notion
into
a
word
,
and
from
thence
in
a
hot
summer
ripen
into
a
tangible
substance
.
 
<EOS>
this
work
,
contain
three
large
volume
in
folio
<EOS>
,
I
design
very
shortly
to
publish
by
the
modern
way
of
subscription
,
not
doubt
but
the
nobility
and
gentry
of
the
land
will
give
me
all
possible
encouragement
,
have
already
have
such
a
taste
of
what
I
be
able
to
perform
.
  
<EOS>
I
record
,
therefore
,
that
brother
Jack
,
brimful
of
this
miraculous
compound
,
reflect
with
indignation
upon
Peter
's
tyranny
,
and
further
provoke
by
the
despondency
of
Martin
,
preface
his
resolution
to
this
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
"
a
rogue
that
lock
up
his
drink
,
turn
away
our
wife
,
cheat
us
of
our
fortune
,
palm
his
crust
upon
us
for
mutton
,
and
at
last
kick
us
out
of
door
;
must
we
be
in
his
fashion
?
 
<EOS>
a
rascal
,
besides
,
that
all
the
street
cry
out
against
.
"
 
<EOS>
have
thus
kindle
and
inflame
himself
as
high
as
possible
,
and
by
consequence
in
a
delicate
temper
for
begin
a
reformation
,
he
set
about
the
work
immediately
,
and
in
three
minute
make
more
dispatch
than
Martin
have
do
in
as
many
hour
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
courteous
reader
,
you
be
give
to
understand
that
zeal
be
never
so
highly
oblige
as
when
you
set
it
a
-
tearing
;
and
Jack
,
who
dote
on
that
quality
in
himself
,
allow
it
at
this
time
its
full
swing
.
 
<EOS>
thus
it
happen
that
,
strip
down
a
parcel
of
gold
lace
a
little
too
hastily
,
he
rent
the
main
body
of
his
coat
from
top
to
bottom
;
and
whereas
his
talent
be
not
of
the
happy
in
take
up
a
stitch
,
he
know
no
well
way
than
to
darn
it
again
with
packthread
thread
and
a
skewer
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
matter
be
yet
infinitely
bad
<EOS>
(
I
record
it
with
tear
)
when
he
proceed
to
the
embroidery
;
for
be
clumsy
of
nature
,
and
of
temper
impatient
withal
,
behold
million
of
stitch
that
require
the
nice
hand
and
sedate
constitution
to
extricate
,
in
a
great
rage
he
tear
off
the
whole
piece
,
cloth
and
all
,
and
fling
it
into
the
kennel
,
and
furiously
thus
continue
his
career
,
"
ah
!
<EOS>
good
brother
Martin
,
"
say
he
,
"
do
as
I
do
,
for
the
love
of
God
;
strip
,
tear
,
pull
,
rend
,
flay
off
all
that
we
may
appear
as
unlike
that
rogue
Peter
as
it
be
possible
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
for
a
hundred
pound
carry
the
least
mark
about
me
that
may
give
occasion
to
the
neighbour
of
suspect
I
be
relate
to
such
a
rascal
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
Martin
,
who
at
this
time
happen
to
be
extremely
phlegmatic
and
sedate
,
beg
his
brother
,
of
all
love
,
not
to
damage
his
coat
by
any
mean
,
for
he
never
would
get
such
another
;
desire
him
to
consider
that
it
be
not
their
business
to
form
their
action
by
any
reflection
upon
Peter
's
,
but
by
observe
the
rule
prescribe
in
their
father
's
will
.
 
<EOS>
that
he
should
remember
Peter
be
still
their
brother
,
whatever
fault
or
injury
he
have
commit
,
and
therefore
they
should
by
all
mean
avoid
such
a
thought
as
that
of
take
measure
for
good
and
evil
from
no
other
rule
than
of
opposition
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
that
it
be
true
the
testament
of
their
good
father
<EOS>
be
very
exact
in
what
relate
to
the
wearing
of
their
coat
;
yet
be
it
no
less
penal
and
strict
in
prescribing
agreement
,
and
friendship
,
and
affection
between
them
.
<EOS>
and
therefore
,
if
strain
a
point
be
at
all
defensible
,
it
would
certainly
be
so
rather
to
the
advance
of
unity
than
increase
of
contradiction
.
  
<EOS>
Martin
have
still
proceed
as
gravely
as
he
begin
,
and
doubtless
would
have
deliver
an
admirable
lecture
of
morality
,
which
may
have
exceedingly
contribute
to
my
reader
's
repose
both
of
body
and
mind
(
the
true
ultimate
end
of
ethic
)
,
but
Jack
be
already
go
a
flight
-
shot
beyond
his
patience
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
in
scholastic
dispute
nothing
serve
to
rouse
the
spleen
of
him
that
oppose
so
much
as
a
kind
of
pedantic
affect
calmness
in
the
respondent
,
disputant
be
for
the
most
part
like
unequal
scale
,
where
the
gravity
of
one
side
advance
the
lightness
of
the
other
,
and
cause
it
to
fly
up
and
kick
the
beam
;
so
it
happen
here
that
the
weight
of
Martin
's
argument
exalt
Jack
's
levity
,
and
make
him
fly
out
and
spurn
against
his
brother
's
moderation
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
Martin
's
patience
put
Jack
in
a
rage
;
but
that
which
most
afflict
him
be
to
observe
his
brother
's
coat
so
well
reduce
into
the
state
of
innocence
,
while
his
own
be
either
wholly
rent
to
his
shirt
,
or
those
place
which
have
escape
his
cruel
clutch
be
still
in
Peter
's
livery
.
<EOS>
so
that
he
look
like
a
drunken
beau
half
rifle
by
bully
,
or
like
a
fresh
tenant
of
Newgate
when
he
have
refuse
the
payment
of
garnish
,
or
like
a
discover
shoplifter
leave
to
the
mercy
of
exchange
-
woman
,
or
like
a
bawd
in
her
old
velvet
petticoat
resign
into
the
secular
hand
of
the
mobile
.
 
<EOS>
like
any
or
like
all
of
these
,
a
medley
of
rag
,
and
lace
,
and
fringe
,
unfortunate
Jack
do
now
appear
;
he
would
have
be
extremely
glad
to
see
his
coat
in
the
condition
of
Martin
's
,
but
infinitely
gladder
to
find
that
of
Martin
in
the
same
predicament
with
his
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
since
neither
of
these
be
likely
to
come
to
pass
,
he
think
fit
to
lend
the
whole
business
another
turn
,
and
to
dress
up
necessity
into
a
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
after
as
many
of
the
fox
's
argument
as
he
could
muster
up
for
bring
Martin
to
reason
,
as
he
call
it
,
or
as
he
mean
it
,
into
his
own
ragged
,
bobtailed
condition
,
and
observe
he
say
all
to
little
purpose
,
<EOS>
what
alas
!
<EOS>
be
leave
for
the
forlorn
Jack
to
do
,
but
,
after
a
million
of
scurrility
against
his
brother
,
to
run
mad
with
spleen
,
and
spite
,
and
contradiction
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
short
,
here
begin
a
mortal
breach
between
these
two
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
go
immediately
to
new
lodging
,
and
in
a
few
day
it
be
for
certain
report
that
he
have
run
out
of
his
wit
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
short
time
after
he
appear
abroad
,
and
confirm
the
report
by
fall
into
the
oddest
whimsy
that
ever
a
sick
brain
conceive
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
the
little
boy
in
the
street
begin
to
salute
him
with
several
name
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
they
would
call
him
Jack
the
Bald
,
sometimes
Jack
with
a
Lanthorn
,
sometimes
Dutch
Jack
,
sometimes
French
Hugh
,
sometimes
Tom
the
Beggar
,
and
sometimes
Knocking
Jack
of
the
North
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
under
one
or
some
or
all
of
these
appellation
(
which
I
leave
the
learned
reader
to
determine
)
<EOS>
that
he
hath
give
rise
to
the
most
illustrious
and
epidemic
sect
of
AEolists
,
who
,
with
honourable
commemoration
,
do
still
acknowledge
the
renowned
Jack
for
their
author
and
founder
.
 
<EOS>
of
whose
original
as
well
as
principle
I
be
now
advance
to
gratify
the
world
with
a
very
particular
account
.
  
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
SECTION
VII
.
 
<EOS>
a
digression
in
praise
of
DIGRESSIONS
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
sometimes
hear
of
an
Iliad
in
a
nut
-
shell
,
but
it
have
be
my
fortune
to
have
much
oftener
see
a
nut
-
shell
in
an
Iliad
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
that
human
life
have
receive
most
wonderful
advantage
from
both
;
but
to
which
of
the
two
<EOS>
the
world
be
chiefly
indebted
,
I
shall
leave
among
the
curious
as
a
problem
worthy
of
their
utmost
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
invention
of
the
latter
,
I
think
the
commonwealth
of
learning
be
chiefly
oblige
to
the
great
modern
improvement
of
digression
.
 
<EOS>
the
late
refinement
in
knowledge
,
run
parallel
to
those
of
diet
in
our
nation
,
which
among
man
of
a
judicious
taste
be
dress
up
in
various
compound
,
consist
in
soup
and
olio
,
fricassee
and
ragout
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
there
be
a
sort
of
morose
,
detract
,
ill
-
breed
people
who
pretend
utterly
to
disrelish
these
polite
innovation
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
similitude
from
diet
,
they
allow
the
parallel
,
but
be
so
bold
as
to
pronounce
the
example
itself
a
corruption
and
degeneracy
of
taste
.
 
<EOS>
They
tell
us
that
the
fashion
of
jumble
fifty
thing
together
in
a
dish
be
at
first
introduce
in
compliance
to
a
depraved
and
debauch
appetite
,
as
well
as
to
a
crazy
constitution
,
and
to
see
a
man
hunt
through
an
olio
after
the
head
and
brain
of
a
goose
,
a
widgeon
,
or
a
woodcock
,
be
a
sign
he
want
a
stomach
and
digestion
for
more
substantial
victual
.
 
<EOS>
further
,
they
affirm
that
digression
in
a
book
be
like
foreign
troop
in
a
state
,
which
argue
the
nation
to
want
a
heart
and
hand
of
its
own
,
and
often
either
subdue
the
native
,
or
drive
them
into
the
most
unfruitful
corner
.
  
<EOS>
but
after
all
that
can
be
object
by
these
supercilious
censor
,
it
be
manifest
the
society
of
writer
would
quickly
be
reduce
to
a
very
inconsiderable
number
if
man
be
put
upon
make
book
with
the
fatal
confinement
of
deliver
nothing
beyond
what
be
to
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
acknowledge
that
be
the
case
the
same
among
us
as
with
the
Greeks
and
Romans
,
when
learn
be
in
its
cradle
,
to
be
rear
and
feed
and
clothe
by
invention
,
it
would
be
an
easy
task
to
fill
up
volume
upon
particular
occasion
without
further
expatiate
from
the
subject
than
by
moderate
excursion
,
help
to
advance
or
clear
the
main
design
.
 
<EOS>
but
with
knowledge
it
have
fare
as
with
a
numerous
army
encamp
in
a
fruitful
country
,
which
for
a
few
day
maintain
itself
by
the
product
of
the
soil
it
be
on
,
till
provision
be
spend
,
they
send
to
forage
many
a
mile
among
friend
or
enemy
,
it
matter
not
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
the
neighbouring
field
,
trample
and
beat
down
,
become
barren
and
dry
,
afford
no
sustenance
but
cloud
of
dust
.
  
<EOS>
the
whole
course
of
thing
be
thus
entirely
change
between
us
and
the
ancient
,
and
the
modern
wisely
sensible
of
it
,
we
of
this
age
have
discover
a
short
and
more
prudent
method
to
become
scholar
and
wit
,
without
the
fatigue
of
reading
or
of
thinking
.
<EOS>
the
most
accomplished
way
of
use
book
at
present
be
twofold
:
either
first
to
serve
them
as
some
man
do
lord
,
learn
their
title
exactly
,
and
then
brag
of
their
acquaintance
;
or
,
secondly
,
which
be
indeed
the
choicer
,
the
profounder
,
and
politer
method
,
to
get
a
thorough
insight
into
the
index
by
which
the
whole
book
be
govern
and
turn
,
like
fish
by
the
tail
.
 
<EOS>
for
to
enter
the
palace
of
learn
at
the
great
gate
require
an
expense
of
time
and
form
,
therefore
man
of
much
haste
and
little
ceremony
be
content
to
get
in
by
the
back
-
door
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
art
be
all
in
a
fly
march
,
and
therefore
more
easily
subdue
by
attack
them
in
the
rear
.
 
<EOS>
thus
physician
discover
the
state
of
the
whole
body
by
consult
only
what
come
from
behind
.
 
<EOS>
thus
man
catch
knowledge
by
throw
their
wit
on
the
posterior
of
a
book
,
as
boy
do
sparrow
with
fling
salt
upon
their
tail
.
 
<EOS>
thus
human
life
be
best
understand
by
the
wise
man
's
rule
of
regard
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
thus
be
the
science
find
,
like
Hercules
'
oxen
,
by
trace
them
backwards
.
 
<EOS>
thus
be
old
science
unravel
like
old
stocking
,
by
begin
at
the
foot
.
  
<EOS>
besides
all
this
,
the
army
of
the
sciences
hath
be
of
late
with
a
world
of
martial
discipline
draw
into
its
close
order
,
so
that
a
view
or
a
muster
may
be
take
of
it
with
abundance
of
expedition
.
<EOS>
for
this
great
blessing
we
be
wholly
indebted
to
system
and
abstract
,
in
which
the
modern
father
of
learning
,
like
prudent
usurer
,
spend
their
sweat
for
the
ease
of
us
their
child
.
 
<EOS>
for
labour
be
the
seed
of
idleness
,
and
it
be
the
peculiar
happiness
of
our
noble
age
to
gather
the
fruit
.
  
<EOS>
now
the
method
of
grow
wise
,
learn
,
and
sublime
have
become
so
regular
an
affair
,
and
so
establish
in
all
its
form
,
the
number
of
writer
must
need
have
increase
accordingly
,
and
to
a
pitch
that
have
make
it
of
absolute
necessity
for
them
to
interfere
continually
with
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
it
be
reckon
that
there
be
not
at
this
present
a
sufficient
quantity
of
new
matter
leave
in
Nature
to
furnish
and
adorn
any
one
particular
subject
to
the
extent
of
a
volume
.
 
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
I
be
tell
by
a
very
skilful
computer
,
who
hath
give
a
full
demonstration
of
it
from
rule
of
arithmetic
.
  
<EOS>
this
perhaps
may
be
object
against
by
those
who
maintain
the
infinity
of
matter
,
and
therefore
will
not
allow
that
any
specie
of
it
can
be
exhaust
.
 
<EOS>
for
answer
to
which
,
let
us
examine
the
noble
branch
of
modern
wit
or
invention
plant
and
cultivate
by
the
present
age
,
and
which
of
all
other
hath
borne
the
most
and
the
fair

<EOS>
for
though
some
remain
of
it
be
leave
us
by
the
ancient
,
yet
have
not
any
of
those
,
as
I
remember
,
be
translate
or
compile
into
system
for
modern
use
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
we
may
affirm
,
to
our
own
honour
,
that
it
have
in
some
sort
be
both
invent
and
bring
to
a
perfection
by
the
same
hand
.
 
<EOS>
what
I
mean
be
,
that
highly
celebrate
talent
among
the
modern
wit
of
deducing
similitude
,
allusion
,
and
application
,
very
surprising
,
agreeable
,
and
apposite
,
from
the
sign
of
either
sex
,
together
with
their
proper
use
.
 
<EOS>
and
truly
,
have
observe
how
little
invention
bear
any
vogue
besides
what
be
derive
into
these
channel
,
I
have
sometimes
have
a
thought
that
the
happy
genius
of
our
age
and
country
be
prophetically
hold
forth
by
that
ancient
typical
description
of
the
indian
pigmy
whose
stature
do
not
exceed
above
two
foot
,
sed
quorum
pudenda
crassa
,
et
ad
talos
usque
pertingentia
.
 
<EOS>
now
I
have
be
very
curious
to
inspect
the
late
production
,
wherein
the
beauty
of
this
kind
have
most
prominently
appear
.
 
<EOS>
and
although
this
vein
hath
bled
so
freely
,
and
all
endeavour
have
be
use
in
the
power
of
human
breath
to
dilate
,
extend
,
and
keep
it
open
,
like
the
Scythians
,
who
have
a
custom
and
an
instrument
to
blow
up
those
part
of
their
mare
,
that
they
may
yield
the
more
milk
;
yet
I
be
under
an
apprehension
it
be
near
grow
dry
and
past
all
recovery
,
and
that
either
some
new
fonde
of
wit
should
,
if
possible
,
be
provide
,
or
else
that
we
must
e'en
be
content
with
repetition
here
as
well
as
upon
all
other
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
this
will
stand
as
an
uncontestable
argument
that
our
modern
wit
be
not
to
reckon
upon
the
infinity
of
matter
for
a
constant
supply
.
<EOS>
what
remain
,
therefore
,
but
that
our
last
recourse
must
be
have
to
large
index
and
little
compendium
?
 
<EOS>
quotation
must
be
plentifully
gather
and
book
in
alphabet
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
end
,
though
author
need
be
little
consult
,
yet
critic
,
and
commentator
,
and
lexicon
carefully
must
.
 
<EOS>
but
above
all
,
those
judicious
collector
of
bright
part
,
and
flower
,
and
observanda
be
to
be
nicely
dwell
on
by
some
call
the
sieve
and
boulter
of
learning
,
though
it
be
leave
undetermined
whether
they
deal
in
pearl
or
meal
,
and
consequently
whether
we
be
more
to
value
that
which
pass
through
or
what
stay
behind
.
  
<EOS>
by
these
method
,
in
a
few
week
there
start
up
many
a
writer
capable
of
manage
the
profound
and
most
universal
subject
.
<EOS>
for
what
though
his
head
be
empty
,
provide
his
commonplace
book
be
full
?
 
<EOS>
and
if
you
will
bate
him
but
the
circumstance
of
method
,
and
style
,
and
grammar
,
and
invention
;
allow
him
but
the
common
privilege
of
transcribe
from
other
,
and
digress
from
himself
as
often
as
he
shall
see
occasion
,
he
will
desire
no
more
ingredient
towards
fit
up
a
treatise
that
shall
make
a
very
comely
figure
on
a
bookseller
's
shelf
,
there
to
be
preserve
neat
and
clean
for
a
long
eternity
,
adorn
with
the
heraldry
of
its
title
fairly
inscribe
on
a
label
,
never
to
be
thumb
or
grease
by
student
,
nor
bind
to
everlasting
chain
of
darkness
in
a
library
,
but
when
the
fulness
of
time
be
come
shall
happily
undergo
the
trial
of
purgatory
in
order
to
ascend
the
sky
.
  
<EOS>
without
these
allowance
how
be
it
possible
we
modern
wit
should
ever
have
an
opportunity
to
introduce
our
collection
list
under
so
many
thousand
head
of
a
different
nature
,
for
want
of
which
the
learned
world
would
be
deprive
of
infinite
delight
as
well
as
instruction
,
and
we
ourselves
bury
beyond
redress
in
an
inglorious
and
undistinguished
oblivion
?
  
<EOS>
from
such
element
as
these
I
be
alive
to
behold
the
day
wherein
the
corporation
of
author
can
outvie
all
its
brother
in
the
field
 
a
happiness
derive
to
us
,
with
a
great
many
other
,
from
our
scythian
ancestor
,
among
whom
the
number
of
pen
be
so
infinite
that
the
grecian
eloquence
have
no
other
way
of
express
it
than
by
say
that
in
the
region
far
to
the
north
it
be
hardly
possible
for
a
man
to
travel
,
the
very
air
be
so
replete
with
feather
.
  
<EOS>
the
necessity
of
this
digression
will
easily
excuse
the
length
,
and
I
have
choose
for
it
as
proper
a
place
as
I
could
readily
find
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
judicious
reader
can
assign
a
fitter
,
I
do
here
empower
him
to
remove
it
into
any
other
corner
he
please

<EOS>
and
so
I
return
with
great
alacrity
to
pursue
a
more
important
concern
.
  
<EOS>
section

<EOS>
a
tale
of
a

<EOS>
the
learn
<EOS>
AEolists
maintain
the
original
cause
of
all
thing
to
be
wind
,
from
which
principle
this
whole
universe
be
at
first
produce
,
and
into
which
it
must
at
last
be
resolve
,
that
the
same
breath
which
have
kindle
and
blow
up
the
flame
of
Nature
should
one
day
blow
it
out
.
  
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
be
what
the
Adepti
understand
by
their
anima
mundi
,
that
be
to
say
,
the
spirit
,
or
breath
,
or
wind
of
the
world
;
or
examine
the
whole
system
by
the
particular
of
Nature
,
and
you
will
find
it
not
to
be
dispute
.
 
<EOS>
for
whether
you
please
to
call
the
forma
informans
of
man
by
the
name
of
spiritus
,
animus
,
afflatus
,
or
anima
<EOS>
,
what
be
all
these
but
several
appellation
for
wind
,
which
be
the
rule
element
in
every
compound
,
and
into
which
they
all
resolve
upon
their
corruption
.
 
<EOS>
further
,
what
be
life
itself
but
,
as
it
be
commonly
call
,
the
breath
of
our
nostril
,
whence
<EOS>
it
be
very
justly
observe
by
naturalist
that
wind
still
continue
of
great
emolument
in
certain
mystery
not
to
be
name
,
give
occasion
for
those
happy
epithet
of
turgidus
and
inflatus
,
apply
either
to
the
emittent
or
recipient
organ
.
  
<EOS>
by
what
I
have
gather
out
of
ancient
record
,
I
find
the
compass
of
their
doctrine
take
in
two
-
and
-
thirty
point
,
wherein
it
would
be
tedious
to
be
very
particular
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
a
few
of
their
most
important
precept
deducible
from
it
be
by
no
means
to
be
omit
;
among
which
,
the
follow
maxim
be
of
much
weight
:
 
<EOS>
that
since
wind
have
the
master
share
as
well
as
operation
in
every
compound
,
by
consequence
those
being
must
be
of
chief
excellence
wherein
that
primordium
appear
most
prominently
to
abound
,
and
therefore
man
be
in
high
perfection
of
all
create
thing
,
as
have
,
by
the
great
bounty
of
philosopher
,
be
endue
with
three
distinct
anima
or
wind
,
to
which
the
sage
aeolist
,
with
much
liberality
,
have
add
a
fourth
,
of
equal
necessity
as
well
as
ornament
with
the
other
three
,
by
this
quartum
principium
take
in
the
four
corner
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
which
give
occasion
to
that
renowned
cabalist
Bombastus
 
of
place
the
body
of
man
in
due
position
to
the
four
cardinal
point
.
  
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
this
,
their
next
principle
be
that
man
bring
with
him
into
the
world
a
peculiar
portion
or
grain
of
wind
,
which
may
be
call
a
quinta
essentia
extract
from
the
other
four
.
 
<EOS>
this
quintessence
be
of
catholic
use
upon
all
emergency
of
life
,
be
improveable
into
all
art
and
science
,
and
may
be
wonderfully
refine
as
well
as
enlarge
by
certain
method
in
education
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
when
blow
up
to
its
perfection
,
ought
not
to
be
covetously
board
up
,
stifle
,
or
hide
under
a
bushel
,
but
freely
communicate
to
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
upon
these
reason
,
and
other
of
equal
weight
,
the
wise
AEolists
affirm
the
gift
of
belch
to
be
the
noblest
act
of
a
rational
creature
.
 
<EOS>
to
cultivate
which
art
,
and
render
it
more
serviceable
to
mankind
,
they
make
use
of
several
method
.
 
<EOS>
at
certain
season
of
the
year
you
may
behold
the
priest
amongst
them
in
vast
number
with
their
mouth
gape
wide
against
a
storm
.
<EOS>
at
other
time
be
to
be
see
several
hundred
link
together
in
a
circular
chain
,
with
every
man
a
pair
of
bellow
apply
to
his
neighbour
,
by
which
they
blow
up
each
other
to
the
shape
and
size
of
a
tun
;
and
for
that
reason
with
great
propriety
of
speech
do
usually
call
their
body
their
vessel
.
 
<EOS>
when
,
by
these
and
the
like
performance
,
they
be
grow
sufficiently
replete
,
they
would
immediately
depart
,
and
disembogue
for
the
public
good
a
plentiful
share
of
their
acquirement
into
their
disciple
'
chap
.
<EOS>
for
we
must
here
observe
that
all
learning
be
esteem
among
them
to
be
compound
from
the
same
principle
.
 
<EOS>
because
,
first
,
it
be
generally
affirm
or
confess
that
learn
puffeth
man
up
;
<EOS>
and
,
secondly
,
they
prove
it
by
the
follow
syllogism
:
 
<EOS>
"
word
be
but
wind
,
and
learning
be
nothing
but
word
;
ergo
,
learning
be
nothing
but
wind
.
"
 
<EOS>
for
this
reason
the
philosopher
among
them
do
in
their
school
deliver
to
their
pupil
all
their
doctrine
and
opinion
by
eructation
,
wherein
they
have
acquire
a
wonderful
eloquence
,
and
of
incredible
variety
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
great
characteristic
by
which
their
chief
sage
be
best
distinguished
be
a
certain
position
of
countenance
,
which
give
undoubted
intelligence
to
what
degree
or
proportion
the
spirit
agitate
the
inward
mass
.
 
<EOS>
for
after
certain
griping
,
the
wind
and
vapour
issue
forth
,
have
first
by
their
turbulence
and
convulsion
within
cause
an
earthquake
in
man
's
little
world
,
distort
the
mouth
,
bloat
the
cheek
,
and
give
the
eye
a
terrible
kind
of
relievo
.
 
<EOS>
at
which
juncture
all
their
belch
be
receive
for
sacred
,
the
sourer
the
well
,
and
swallow
with
infinite
consolation
by
their
meagre
devotee
.
 
<EOS>
and
to
render
these
yet
more
complete
,
because
the
breath
of
man
's
life
be
in
his
nostril
,
therefore
the
choice
,
most
edifying
,
and
most
enlivening
belch
be
very
wisely
convey
through
that
vehicle
to
give
them
a
tincture
as
they
pass
.
  
<EOS>
Their
god
be
the
four
wind
,
whom
they
worship
as
the
spirit
that
pervade
and
enliven
the
universe
,
and
as
those
from
whom
alone
all
inspiration
can
properly
be
say
to
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
the
chief
of
these
,
to
whom
they
perform
the
adoration
of
Latria
,
be
the
Almighty
North
,
an
ancient
deity
,
whom
the
inhabitant
of
Megalopolis
in
Greece
have
likewise
in
high
reverence
.
 
<EOS>
"
omnium
deorum
Boream
maxime
celebrant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
god
,
though
endue
with
ubiquity
,
be
yet
suppose
by
the
profounder
aeolist
to
possess
one
peculiar
habitation
,
or
(
to
speak
in
form
)
<EOS>
a
caelum
empyraeum
<EOS>
,
wherein
he
be
more
intimately
present
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
situate
in
a
certain
region
well
know
to
the
ancient
Greeks
,
by
them
call
[
greek
text
which
can
not
be
reproduce
]
,
the
Land
of
Darkness
.
 
<EOS>
and
although
many
controversy
have
arise
upon
that
matter
,
yet
so
much
be
undisputed
,
that
from
a
region
of
the
like
denomination
the
most
refined
aeolist
have
borrow
their
original
,
from
whence
in
every
age
the
zealous
among
their
priesthood
have
bring
over
their
choice
inspiration
,
fetch
it
with
their
own
hand
from
the
fountain
-
head
in
certain
bladder
,
and
displode
it
among
the
sectary
in
all
nation
,
who
do
,
and
do
,
and
ever
will
,
daily
gasp
and
pant
after
it
.
  
<EOS>
now
their
mystery
and
rite
be
perform
in
this
manner
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
well
known
among
the
learn
that
the
virtuoso
of
former
age
have
a
contrivance
for
carry
and
preserve
wind
in
cask
or
barrel
,
which
be
of
great
assistance
upon
long
sea
-
voyage
,
and
the
loss
of
so
useful
an
art
at
present
be
very
much
to
be
lament
,
<EOS>
though
,
I
know
not
how
,
with
great
negligence
omit
by
Pancirollus
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
invention
ascribe
to
AEolus
himself
,
from
whom
this
sect
be
denominate
,
and
who
,
in
honour
of
their
founder
's
memory
,
have
to
this
day
preserve
great
number
of
those
barrel
,
<EOS>
whereof
they
fix
one
in
each
of
their
temple
,
first
beat
out
the
top
.
 
<EOS>
into
this
barrel
upon
solemn
day
the
priest
enter
,
where
,
have
before
duly
prepare
himself
by
the
method
already
describe
,
a
secret
funnel
be
also
convey
to
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
,
which
admit
new
supply
of
inspiration
from
a
northern
chink
or
cranny
.
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
you
behold
him
swell
immediately
to
the
shape
and
size
of
his
vessel
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
posture
he
disembogue
whole
tempest
upon
his
auditory
,
as
the
spirit
from
beneath
give
him
utterance
,
which
issue
ex
adytis
and
penetralibus
,
be
not
perform
without
much
pain
and
griping
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
wind
in
break
forth
deal
with
his
face
as
it
do
with
that
of
the
sea
,
first
blackening
,
then
wrinkle
,
and
at
last
burst
it
into
a
foam
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
this
guise
<EOS>
the
sacred
AEolist
deliver
his
oracular
belch
to
his
pant
disciple
,
of
whom
some
be
greedily
gape
after
the
sanctify
breath
,
other
be
all
the
while
hymn
out
the
praise
of
the
wind
,
and
gently
waft
to
and
fro
by
their
own
humming
,
do
thus
represent
the
soft
breeze
of
their
deity
appease
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
from
this
custom
of
the
priest
that
some
author
maintain
these
aeolist
to
have
be
very
ancient
in
the
world
,
because
the
delivery
of
their
mystery
,
which
I
have
just
now
mention
,
appear
exactly
the
same
with
that
of
other
ancient
oracle
,
whose
inspiration
be
owe
to
certain
subterraneous
effluvium
of
wind
deliver
with
the
same
pain
to
the
priest
,
and
much
about
the
same
influence
on
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
indeed
that
these
be
frequently
manage
and
direct
by
female
officer
,
whose
organ
be
understand
to
be
better
dispose
for
the
admission
of
those
oracular
gust
,
as
enter
and
pass
up
through
a
receptacle
of
great
capacity
,
and
cause
also
a
pruriency

the
way
,
such
as
with
due
management
have
be
refine
from
carnal
into
a
spiritual
ecstasy
.
 
<EOS>
and
to
strengthen
this
profound
conjecture
,
it
be
further
insist
that
this
custom
of
female
priest
be
keep
up
still
in
certain
refined
college
of
our
modern
AEolists
,
who
be
agree
to
receive
their
inspiration
,
derive
through
the
receptacle
aforesaid
,
like
their
ancestor
the
Sybils
.
  
<EOS>
and
whereas
the
mind
of
man
,
when
he
give
the
spur
and
bridle
to
his
thought
,
do
never
stop
,
but
naturally
sallie
out
into
both
extreme
of
high
and
low
,
of
good
and
evil
,
his
first
flight
of
fancy
commonly
transport
him
to
idea
of
what
be
most
perfect
,
finish
,
and
exalt
,
till
,
have
soar
out
of
his
own
reach
and
sight
,
not
well
perceive
how
near
the
frontier
of
height
and
depth
border
upon
each
other
,
with
the
same
course
and
wing
he
fall
down
plump
into
the
low
bottom
of
thing
,
like
one
who
travel
the
east
into
the
west
,
or
like
a
straight
line
draw
by
its
own
length
into
a

<EOS>
whether
a
tincture
of
malice
in
our
nature
make
us
fond
of
furnish
every
bright
idea
with
its
reverse
,
or
whether
reason
,
reflect
upon
the
sum
of
thing
,
can
,
like
the
sun
,
serve
only
to
enlighten
one
half
of
the
globe
,
leave
the
other
half
by
necessity
under
shade
and
darkness
,
or
whether
fancy
,
fly
up
to
the
imagination
of
what
be
high
and
good
,
become
over
-
short
,
and
spend
,
and
weary
,
and
suddenly
fall
,
like
a
dead
bird
of
paradise
,
to
the
ground
;
or
whether
,
after
all
these
metaphysical
conjecture
,
I
have
not
entirely
miss
the
true
reason
;
the
proposition
,
however
,
which
have
stand
me
in
so
much
circumstance
be
altogether
true
,
that
as
the
most
uncivilised
part
of
mankind
have
some
way
or
other
climb
up
into
the
conception
of
a
God
or
Supreme
Power
,
so
they
have
seldom
forget
to
provide
their
fear
with
certain
ghastly
notion
,
which
,
instead
of
well
,
have
serve
them
pretty
tolerably
for
a
devil
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
proceeding
seem
to
be
natural
enough
,
for
it
be
with
man
whose
imagination
be
lift
up
very
high
after
the
same
rate
as
with
those
whose
body
be
so
,
that
as
they
be
delighted
with
the
advantage
of
a
near
contemplation
upwards
,
so
they
be
equally
terrified
with
the
dismal
prospect
of
the
precipice
below
.
 
<EOS>
thus
in
the
choice
of
a
devil
it
have
be
the
usual
method
of
mankind
to
single
out
some
being
,
either
in
act
or
in
vision
,
which
be
in
most
antipathy
to
the
god
they
have
frame
.
 
<EOS>
thus
also
the
sect
of
the
AEolists
possess
themselves
with
a
dread
and
horror
and
hatred
of
two
malignant
nature
,
betwixt
whom
and
the
deity
they
adore
perpetual
enmity
be
establish
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
of
these
be
the
chameleon
,
swear
foe
to
inspiration
,
who
in
scorn
devour
large
influence
of
their
god
,
without
refund
the
small
blast
by
eructation
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
be
a
huge
terrible
monster
call
Moulinavent
,
who
with
four
strong
arm
wage
eternal
battle
with
all
their
divinity
,
dexterously
turn
to
avoid
their
blow
and
repay
them
with
interest
.
   
<EOS>
thus
furnish
,
and
set
out
with
god
as
well
as
devil
,
be
the
renowned
sect
of
AEolists
,
which
make
at
this
day
so
illustrious
a
figure
in
the
world
,
and
whereof
that
polite
nation
of
laplander
be
beyond
all
doubt
a
most
authentic
branch
,
of
whom
I
therefore
can
not
without
injustice
here
omit
to
make
honourable
mention
,
since
they
appear
to
be
so
closely
ally
in
point
of
interest
as
well
as
inclination
with
their
brother
AEolists
among
us
,
as
not
only
to
buy
their
wind
by
wholesale
from
the
same
merchant
,
but
also
to
retail
them
after
the
same
rate
and
method
,
and
to
customer
much
alike
.
  
<EOS>
now
whether
the
system
here
deliver
be
wholly
compile
by
Jack
,
or
,
as
some
writer
believe
,
rather
copy
from
the
original
at
Delphos
,
with
certain
addition
and
emendation
suit
to
time
and
circumstance
,
I
shall
not
absolutely
determine

<EOS>
this
<EOS>
I
may
affirm
,
that
Jack
give
it
at
least
a
new
turn
,
and
form
it
into
the
same
dress
and
model
as
it
lie
deduce
by
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
long
seek
after
this
opportunity
of
do
justice
to
a
society
of
man
for
whom
I
have
a
peculiar
honour
,
and
whose
opinion
as
well
as
practice
have
be
extremely
misrepresented
and
traduce
by
the
malice
or
ignorance
of
their
adversary
.
 
<EOS>
for
I
think
it
one
of
the
great
and
good
of
human
action
to
remove
prejudice
and
place
thing
in
their
true
and
fair
light
,
which
I
therefore
boldly
undertake

without

nor
shall

detract
from
the
just
reputation
of
this
famous

that
its

institution
be
owe

such

I
have
describe
Jack
to
be
,
a
person
whose
intellectual
be
overturn
and
his
brain
shake
out
of
its
natural
position
,
which
we
commonly
suppose
to
be
a
distemper
,
and
call
by
the
name
of
madness
or
frenzy
.
 
<EOS>
for
if
we
take
a
survey
of
the
great
action
that
have
be
perform
in
the
world
under
the
influence
of
single
man
,
which
be
the
establishment
of
new

by
conquest
,
the
advance
and
progress
of
new
scheme
in
philosophy
,
and
the
contrive
as
well
as
the
propagating
of
new

we
shall
find
the
author
of
them
all
to
have
be
person
whose
natural
reason
hath
admit
great
revolution
from
their
diet
,
their
education
,
the
prevalency
of
some
certain
temper
,
together
with
the
particular
influence
of
air
and
climate
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
there
be
something
individual
in
human
mind
that
easily
kindle
at
the
accidental
approach
and
collision
of
certain
circumstance
,
which
,
though
of
paltry
and
mean
appearance
,
do
often
flame
out
into
the
great
emergency
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
for
great
turn
be
not
always
give
by
strong
hand
,
but
by
lucky
adaptation
and
at
proper
season
,
and
it
be
of
no
import
where
the

be

if
the

have
once
get
up
into
the
brain
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
upper

of
man
be

like
the
middle
region
of
the
air
,
the
material
be
form
from
cause
of
the
wide
difference
,
yet
produce
at
last
the

substance
and
effect

<EOS>
mist
arise
from
the
earth
,
steam
from
dunghill
,
exhalation
from
the

,
and
smoke
from
fire
;
yet
all
cloud
be
the
same
in
composition
as
well
as
consequence
,
and
the
fume
issue
from
a
jakes
will
furnish
as
comely
and
useful
a
vapour
as
incense
from
an
altar
.
 
<EOS>
thus
far
,
I
suppose
,
will
easily
be
grant
me
;
and
then
it
will
follow
that
as
the
face
of
Nature
never
produce
rain
but
when
it
be
overcast
and
disturbed
,
so
human
understanding
seat
in

must
be
trouble
and
overspread
by
vapour
ascend
from
the
low
faculty
to
water
the
invention
and
render
it
fruitful

<EOS>
now
although
these
vapour
(
as
it
hath
be
already
say
)
be
of
as
various
original
as
those

yet
the
crop
they
produce
differ
both
in
kind

degree
,
merely
accord
to
the
soil
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
produce
two
instance
to
prove
and
explain
what
I
be
now
advance
.
  
<EOS>
a
certain
great
prince
 
raise
a
mighty
army
,
fill
his
coffer
with
infinite
treasure
,
provide
an
invincible
fleet
,
and
all
this
without
give
the
least
part
of
his
design
to
his
great
minister
or
his
near
favourite
.
 
<EOS>
immediately
the
whole
world
be
alarm
,
the
neighbouring
crown
in
tremble
expectation
towards
what
point
the
storm
would
burst
,
the
small
politician
everywhere
form
profound
conjecture
.
 
<EOS>
some
believe
he
have
lay
a
scheme
for
universal
monarchy
;
other
,
after
much
insight
,
determine
the
matter
to
be
a
project
for
pull
down
the
Pope
and
set
up
the
Reformed
religion
,
which
have
once
be
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
some
again
,
of
a
deep
sagacity
,
send
him
into
Asia
to
subdue
the
Turk
and
recover
Palestine
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
all
these
project
and
preparation
,
a
certain
state
-
surgeon
,
gather
the
nature
of
the
disease
by
these
symptom
,
attempt
the
cure
,
at
one
blow
perform
the
operation
,
break
the
bag
and
out
fly
the
vapour
;
nor
do
anything
want
to
render
it
a
complete
remedy
,
only
that
the
prince
unfortunately
happen
to
die
in
the
performance
.
 
<EOS>
now
be
the
reader
exceed
curious
to
learn
from
whence
<EOS>
this
vapour
take
its
rise
,
which
have
so
long
set
the
nation
at
a
gaze
?
 
<EOS>
what
secret
wheel
,
what
hide
spring
,
could
put
into
motion
so
wonderful
an
engine
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
afterwards
discover
that
the
movement
of
this
whole
machine
have
be
direct
by
an
absent
female
,
who
be
remove
into
an
enemy
's
country
.
 
<EOS>
what
should
an
unhappy
prince
do
in
such
ticklish
circumstance
as
these
?
 
<EOS>
He

<EOS>
the
very

principle
that
influence
a

to
break
the
window
of
a
woman
who
have
jilt
him
naturally
stir
up
a
great
prince
to
raise
mighty
army
and
dream
of
nothing
but
siege
,
battle
,
and
victory
.
  
<EOS>
the
other
instance
be
what
I
have
read
somewhere
in
a
very
ancient
author
of
a
mighty
king
,
who
,
for
the
space
of
above
thirty
year
,
amuse
himself
to
take

lose

,

<EOS>
It
be
record
that
the
philosopher
of
each
country
be
in
grave
dispute
upon
cause
natural
,
moral
,
and
political
,
to
find
out
where
they
should
assign
an
original
solution
of
this
phenomenon
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
the
vapour
or
spirit
which
animate
the
hero
's
brain
,
be
in
perpetual
circulation
,
seize
upon
that
region
of
the
human
body
so
renowned
for
furnish
the
zibeta
occidentalis
,
and
gather
there
into
a
tumour
,
leave
the
rest
of
the
world
for
that
time
in
peace
.
<EOS>
of
such
mighty
consequence
be
it
where
those
exhalation
fix
,
and
of
so
little
from
whence
they
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
the
same
spirit
which
in
their
superior
progress
would
conquer
a
kingdom
descend
upon
the
anus
,
conclude
in
a
fistula
.
  
<EOS>
let
us
next
examine
the
great
introducer
of
new
scheme
in
philosophy
,
and
search
till
we
can
find
from
what
faculty
of
the
soul
the
disposition
arise
in
mortal
man
of
take
it
into
his
head
to
advance
new
system
with
such
an
eager
zeal
in
thing
agree
on
all
hand
impossible
to
be
know
;
from
what
seed
this
disposition
spring
,
and
to
what
quality
of
human
nature
these
grand
innovator
have
be
indebte
for
their
number
of
disciple
,
because
it
be
plain
that
several
of
the
chief
among
them
,
both
ancient
and
modern
,
be
usually
mistake
by
their
adversary
,
and
,
indeed
,
by
all
,
except
their
own
follower
,
to
have
be
person
craze
or
out
of
their
wit
,
have
generally
proceed
in
the
common
course
of
their
word
and
action
by
a
method
very
different
from
the
vulgar
dictate
of
unrefined
reason
,
agree
for
the
most
part
in
their
several
model
with
their
present
undoubted
successor
in
the
academy
of
modern
Bedlam
,
whose
merit
and
principle
I
shall
further
examine
in
due
place
.
 
<EOS>
of
this
kind
be
Epicurus
,
Diogenes
,
Apollonius
,
Lucretius
,
Paracelsus
,
Des
Cartes
,
and
other
,
who
,
if
they
be
now
in
the
world
,
tie
fast
and
separate
from
their
follower
,
would
in
this
our
undistinguishing
age
incur
manifest
danger
of
phlebotomy
,
and
whip
,
and
chain
,
and
dark
chamber
,
and
straw
.
 
<EOS>
for
what
man
in
the
natural
state
or
course
of
thinking
do
ever
conceive
it
in
his
power
to
reduce
the
notion
of
all
mankind
exactly
to
the
same
length
,
and
breadth
,
and
height
of
his
own
?
 
<EOS>
yet
this
be
the
first
humble
and
civil
design
of
all
innovator
in
the
empire
of
reason
.
 
<EOS>
Epicurus
modestly
hope
that
one
time
or
other
a
certain
fortuitous
concourse
of
all
man
's
opinion
,
after
perpetual
jostling
,
the
sharp
with
the
smooth
,
the
light
and
the
heavy
,
the
round
and
the
square
,
would
,
by
certain
clinamina
,
unite
in
the
notion
of
atom
and
void
,
as
these
do
in
the
original
of
all
thing
.
 
<EOS>
Cartesius
reckon
to
see
before
he
die
the
sentiment
of
all
philosopher
,
like
so
many
less
star
in
his
romantic
system
,
rapt
and
draw
within
his
own
vortex
.
 
<EOS>
now
I
would
gladly
be
inform
how
it
be
possible
to
account
for
such
imagination
as
these
in
particular
man
,
without
recourse
to
my
phenomenon
of
vapour
ascend
from
the
low
faculty
to
overshadow
the
brain
,
and
there
distil
into
conception
,
for
which
the
narrowness
of
our
mother
-
tongue
have
not
yet
assign
any
other
name
beside
that
of
madness
or
frenzy
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
therefore
now
conjecture
how
it
come
to
pass
that
none
of
these
great
prescriber
do
ever
fail
provide
themselves
and
their
notion
with
a
number
of
implicit
disciple
,
and
I
think
the
reason
be
easy
to
be
assign
,
for
there
be
a
peculiar
string
in
the
harmony
of
human
understanding
,
which
in
several
individual
be
exactly
of
the
same
tuning
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
if
you
can
dexterously
screw
up
to
its
right
key
,
and
then
strike
gently
upon
it
whenever
you
have
the
good
fortune
to
light
among
those
of
the
same
pitch
,
they
will
by
a
secret
necessary
sympathy
strike
exactly
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
this
one
circumstance
lie
all
the
skill
or
luck

It
be
therefore
a
point
of
the
nice

to
distinguish
and
adapt
this
noble

respect

the

Cicero
understand
this

write

with

among

to

of

<EOS>
for

to
speak
a
bold
truth
,
it
be
a
fatal
miscarriage
so
ill
to
order
affair
as
to
pass
for
a
fool
in
one
company

when
in
another
you
may
be
treat
as
a

which
I
desire
some
certain
gentleman
of
my
acquaintance
to
lay
up
in
their
heart
as
a
very
seasonable
innuendo
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
indeed
,
be
the
fatal
mistake
of
that
worthy
gentleman
,
my
most
ingenious
friend
Mr.
Wotton
,
a
person
in
appearance
ordain
for
great
design
as
well
as
performance

whether
you

<EOS>
surely
no

ever
advance
into
the
public
with
fitter
qualification
of
body
and
mind
for
the
propagation
of
a
new
religion

<EOS>
oh

have
those
happy

,
misapply
to
vain
philosophy
,
be
turn
into
their
proper
channel
of
dream
and
vision
,
where
distortion
of
mind
and
countenance
be
of
such
sovereign
use
,
<EOS>
the
base
,
detract
world
would
not
then
have
dare
to
report
that
something
be
amiss
,
that
his
brain
hath
undergo
an
unlucky
shake
,
which
even
his
brother
modernist
themselves
,
like
ungrate
,
do
whisper
so
loud
that
it
reach
up
to
the
very
garret
I
be
now
write
in

<EOS>
lastly
,
whoever
please
to
look
into
the
fountain
of
enthusiasm
,
from
whence
in
all
age
have
eternally
proceed
such
fattening
stream
,
will
find
the
spring
-
head
to
have
be
as
troubled
and
muddy
as
the
current
.
 
<EOS>
of
such
great
emolument
be
a
tincture
of
this
vapour
,
which
the
world
call
madness
,
that
without
its
help
the
world
would
not
only
be
deprive
of
those
two
great
blessing
,
conquest
and
system
,
but
even
all
mankind
would
unhappily
be
reduce
to
the
same
belief
in
thing
invisible
.
 
<EOS>
now
the
former
postulatum
be
hold
,
that
it
be
of
no
import
from
what
original
this
vapour
proceed
,
but
either
in
what
angle
it
strike
and
spread
over
the
understanding
,
or
upon
what
specie
of
brain
it
ascend
,
it
will
be
a
very
delicate
point
to
cut
the
feather
and
divide
the
several
reason
to
a
nice
and
curious
reader
,
how
this
numerical
difference
in
the
brain
can
produce
effect
of
so
vast
a
difference
from
the
same
vapour
as
to
be
the
sole
point
of
individuation
between
Alexander
the
Great
,
Jack
of
Leyden
,
and
Monsieur
Des
Cartes
.
 
<EOS>
the
present
argument
be
the
most
abstract
that
ever
I
engage
in
;
it
strain
my
faculty
to
their
high
stretch
,
and
I
desire
the
reader
to
attend
with
utmost
perpensity
,
for
I
now
proceed
to
unravel
this
knotty
point
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
in
mankind
a
certain
.
.
.
<EOS>
Hic
multa
.
.
.
<EOS>
desiderantur
.
.
.
<EOS>
and
this
I
take
to
be
a
clear
solution
of
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
have
,
therefore
,
so
narrowly
pass
through
this
intricate
difficulty
,
the
reader
will
,
I
be
sure
,
agree
with
me
in
the
conclusion
that
,
if
the
modern
mean
by
madness
only
a
disturbance
or
transposition
of
the
brain
,
by
force
of
certain
vapour
issue
up
from
the
low
faculty
,
then
have
this
madness
be
the
parent
of
all
those
mighty
revolution
that
have
happen
in
empire
,
in
philosophy
,
and
in
religion
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
brain
in
its
natural
position
and
state
of
serenity
disposeth
its
owner
to
pass
his
life
in
the
common
form
,
without
any
thought
of
subdue
multitude
to
his
own
power
,
his
reason
,
or
his
vision
,
and
<EOS>
the
more
he
shape
his
understanding
by
the
pattern
of
human
learning
,
the
less
he
be
incline
to
form
party
after
his
particular
notion
,
because
that
instruct
him
in
his
private
infirmity
,
as
well
as
in
the
stubborn
ignorance
of
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
a
man
's
fancy
get
astride
on
his
reason
,
when
imagination
be
at
cuff
with
the
sense
,
and
common
understanding
as
well
as
common
sense
be
kick
out
of
door
,
the
first
proselyte
he
make
be
himself
;
and
when
that
be
once
compass
,
the
difficulty
be
not
so
great
in
bring
over
other
,
a
strong
delusion
always
operate
from
without
as
vigorously
as
from
within
.
 
<EOS>
for
can
not
and
<EOS>
vision
be
to
the
ear
and
the
eye
the
same
that
tickle
be
to
the
touch
.
 
<EOS>
those
entertainment
and
pleasure
we
most
value
in
life
be
such
as
dupe
and
play
the
wag
with
the
sense
.
 
<EOS>
for
if
we
take
an
examination
of
what
be
generally
understand
by
happiness
,
as
it
have
respect
either
to
the
understanding
or
the
sense
we
shall
find
all
its
property
and
adjunct
will
herd
under
this
short
definition
,
that
it
be
a
perpetual
possession
of
be
well
deceive
.
 
<EOS>
and
first
,
with
relation
to
the
mind
or
understanding
,
it
be
manifest
what
mighty
advantage
fiction
have
over
truth
,
and
the
reason
be
just
at
our
elbow
:
 
because
imagination
can
build
noble
scene
and
produce
more
wonderful
revolution
than
fortune
or
nature
will
be
at
the
expense
to
furnish
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
mankind
so
much
to
blame
in
his
choice
thus
determine
him
,
if
we
consider
that
the
debate
merely
lie
between
thing
past
and
thing
conceive
,
and
so
the
question
be
only
this
:
<EOS>
whether
thing
that
have
place
in
the
imagination
may
not
as
properly
be
say
to
exist
as
those
that
be
seat
in
the
memory
?
<EOS>
which
may
be
justly
hold
in
the
affirmative
,
and
very
much
to
the
advantage
of
the
former
,
since
this
be
acknowledge
to
be
the
womb
of
thing
,
and
the
other
allow
to
be
no
more
than
the
grave
.
<EOS>
again
,
if
we
take
this
definition
of
happiness
and
examine
it
with
reference
to
the
sense
,
it
will
be
acknowledge
wonderfully
adapt
.
<EOS>
how
sad
and
insipid
do
all
object
accost
us
that
be
not
convey
in
the
vehicle
of
delusion
!
 
<EOS>
how
shrunk
be
everything
as
it
appear
in
the
glass
of
Nature
,
so
that
if
it
be
not
for
the
assistance
of
artificial
medium
,
false
light
,
refract
angle
,
varnish
,
and
tinsel
,
there
would
be
a
mighty
level
in
the
felicity
and
enjoyment
of
mortal
man
.
 
<EOS>
if
this
be
seriously
consider
by
the
world
,
as
I
have
a
certain
reason
to
suspect
it
hardly
will
,
man
would
no
longer
reckon
among
their
high
point
of
wisdom
the
art
of
expose
weak
side
and
publishing
infirmity
 
<EOS>
an
employment
,
in
my
opinion
,
neither
well
nor
bad
than
that
of
unmasking
,
which
,
I
think
,
have
never
be
allow
fair
usage
,
either
in
the
world
or
the
playhouse
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
proportion
that
credulity
be
a
more
peaceful
possession
of
the
mind
than
curiosity
,
so
far
preferable
be
that
wisdom
which
converse
about
the
surface
to
that
pretended
philosophy
which
enter
into
the
depth
of
thing
and
then
come
gravely
back
with
information
and
discovery
,
that
in
the
inside
they
be
good
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
sense
to
which
all
object
first
address
themselves
be
the
sight
and
the
touch
;
these
never
examine
farther
than
the
colour
,
the
shape
,
the
size
,
and
whatever
other
quality
dwell
or
be
draw
by
art
upon
the
outward
of
body
;
and
then
come
reason
officiously
,
with
tool
for
cutting
,
and
opening
,
and
mangling
,
and
pierce
,
offer
to
demonstrate
that
they
be
not
of
the
same
consistence
quite
through
.
 
<EOS>
now
I
take
all
this
to
be
the
last
degree
of
pervert
Nature
,
one
of
whose
eternal
law
it
be
to
put
her
good
furniture
forward
.
 
<EOS>
and
therefore
,
in
order
to
save
the
charge
of
all
such
expensive
anatomy
for
the
time
to
come
,
I
do
here
think
fit
to
inform
the
reader
that
in
such
conclusion
as
these
reason
be
certainly
in
the
right
;
and
that
in
most
corporeal
being
which
have
fall
under
my
cognisance
,
the
outside
hath
be
infinitely
preferable
to
the
in
<EOS>
,
whereof
I
have
be
further
convince
from
some
late
experiment
.
 
<EOS>
last
week
I
see
a
woman
flay
,
and
you
will
hardly
believe
how
much
it
alter
her
person
for
the
bad
.
 
<EOS>
yesterday
I
order
the
carcass
of
a
beau
to
be
strip
in
my
presence
,
when
we
be
all
amazed
to
find
so
many
unsuspected
fault
under
one
suit
of
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
lay
open
his
brain
,
his
heart
,
and
his
spleen
,
but
I
plainly
perceive
at
every
operation
that
the
farther
we
proceed
,
we
find
the
defect
increase
upon
us
,
in
number
and
bulk
;
from
all
which
I
justly
form
this
conclusion
to
myself
,
that
whatever
philosopher
or
projector
can
find
out
an
art
to
sodder
and
patch
up
the
flaw
and
imperfection
of
Nature
,
will
deserve
much
well
of
mankind
and
teach
us
a
more
useful
science
than
that
so
much
in
present
esteem
,
of
widen
and
expose
them
(
like
him
who
hold
anatomy
to
be
the
ultimate
end
of
physic
)
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
whose
fortune
and
disposition
have
place
him
in
a
convenient
station
to
enjoy
the
fruit
of
this
noble
art
,
he
that
can
with
Epicurus
content
his
idea
with
the
film
and
image
that
fly
off
upon
his
sense
from
the
superfice
of
thing
,
such
a
man
,
<EOS>
truly
wise
,
cream
off
Nature
,
leave
the
sour
and
the
dreg
for
philosophy
and
reason
to
lap
up
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
sublime
and
refined
point
of
felicity
call
the
possession
of
be
well
-
deceive
,
the
serene
peaceful
state
of
be
a
fool
among
knave
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
madness
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
certain
that
,
accord
to
the
system
I
have
above
deduce
,
every
species
thereof
proceed
from
a
redundancy
of
vapour
;
therefore
,
as
some
kind
of
frenzy
give
double
strength
to
the
sinew
,
so
there
be
of
other
specie
which
add
vigour
,
and
life
,
and
spirit
to
the
brain
.
 
<EOS>
now
it
usually
happen
that
these
active
spirit
,
get
possession
of
the
brain
,
resemble
those
that
haunt
other
waste
and
empty
dwelling
,
which
for
want
of
business
either
vanish
and
carry
away
a
piece
of
the
house
,
or
else
stay
at
home
and
fle
it
all
out
of
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
by
which
be
mystically
display
the
two
principal
branch
of
madness
,
and
which
some
philosopher
,
not
consider
so
well
as
I
,
have
mistake
to
be
different
in
their
cause
,
over
-
hastily
assign
the
first
to
deficiency
and
the
other
to
redundance
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
it
therefore
manifest
,
from
what
I
have
here
advance
,
that
the
main
point
of
skill
and
address
be
to
furnish
employment
for
this
redundancy
of
vapour
,
and
prudently
to
adjust
the
season
of
it
,
by
which
mean
it
may
certainly
become
of
cardinal
and
catholic
emolument
in
a
commonwealth
.
 
<EOS>
thus
one
man
,
choose
a
proper
juncture
,
leap
into
a
gulf
,
from
thence
proceed
a
hero
,
and
be
call
the
saviour
of
his
country
.
 
<EOS>
another
achieve
the
same
enterprise
,
but
unluckily
timing
it
,
have
leave
the
brand
of
madness
fix
as
a
reproach
upon
his
memory
.
 
<EOS>
upon
so
nice
<EOS>
a
distinction
be
we
teach
to
repeat
the
name
of
Curtius
with
reverence
and
love
,
that
of
Empedocles
with
hatred
and
contempt
.
 
<EOS>
thus
also
it
be
usually
conceive
that
the
eld
Brutus
only
personate
the
fool
and
madman
for
the
good
of
the
public
;
but
this
be
nothing
else
than
a
redundancy
of
the
same
vapour
long
misapply
,
call
by
the
Latins
ingenium
par
negotiis
,
or
(
to
translate
it
as
nearly
as
I
can
)
,
a
sort
of
frenzy
never
in
its
right
element
till
you
take
it
up
in
business
of
the
state
.
  
<EOS>
upon
all
which
,
and
many
other
reason
of
equal
weight
,
though
not
equally
curious
,
I
do
here
gladly
embrace
an

entreat
your

with
due
gravity
and

talk
much
of
hard
time

and
taxis
,
and
the
whore
of
Babylon
,
bar
up
the
wooden
of
his
cell
constantly
at
eight
o'clock
,
dream
of
fire
,
and
shoplifter
,
and
court
-
customer
,
and
privileged
place

<EOS>
now
what
a
figure
would
all
these
acquirement
amount
to
if
the
owner
be
send
into
the
City
among
his
brother
!
 
<EOS>
Behold
a
fourth
in
much
and
deep
conversation
with
himself
,
bite
his
thumb
at
proper
juncture
<EOS>
,
his
countenance
chequer
with
business
and
design
;
sometimes
walk
very
fast
,
with
his
eye
nail
to
a
paper
that
he
hold
in
his
hand
;
a
great
saver
of
time
,
somewhat
thick
of
hearing
,
very
short
of
sight
,
but
more
of
memory
;
a
man
ever
in
haste
,
a
great
hatcher
and
breeder
of
business
,
and
excellent
at
the
famous
art
of
whisper
nothing
;
a
huge
idolator
of
monosyllable
and
procrastination
,
so
ready
to
give
his
word
to
everybody
that
he
never
keep
it
;
one
that
have
forget
the
common
meaning
of
word
,
but
an
admirable
retainer
of
the
sound
;
extremely
subject
to
the
looseness
,
for
his
occasion
be
perpetually
call
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
approach
his
grate
in
his
familiar
interval
,
"
Sir
,
"
say
he
,
"
give
me
a
penny
<EOS>
and
I
will
sing
you
a
song
;
but
give
me
the
penny
first
"
<EOS>
(
hence
come
the
common
saying
and
commoner
practice
of
part
with
money
for
a
song
)
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
complete
system
of
court
-
skill
be
here
describe
in
every
branch
of
it
,
and
all
utterly
lose
with
wrong
application
!
 
<EOS>
Accost
the
hole
of
another
kennel
,
first
stop
your
nose
,
you
will
behold
a
surly
,
gloomy
,
nasty
,
slovenly
mortal
,
rake
in
his
own
dung
and
dabble
in
his
urine
.
 
<EOS>
the
good
part
of
his
diet
be
the
reversion
of
his
own
ordure
,
which
expire
into
steam
,
whirls
perpetually
about
,
and
at
last
reinfund
.
 
<EOS>
His
complexion
be
of
a
dirty
yellow
,
with
a
thin
scatter
beard
,
exactly
agreeable
to
that
of
his
diet
upon
its
first
declination
,
like
other
insect
,
who
,
have
their
birth
and
education
in
an
excrement
,
from
thence
borrow
their
colour
and
their
smell
.
 
<EOS>
the
student
of
this
apartment
be
very
spare
of
his
word
,
but
somewhat
over
-
liberal
of
his
breath
.
 
<EOS>
He
hold
his
hand
out
ready
to
receive
your
penny
,
and
immediately
upon
receipt
withdraw
to
his
former
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
now
be
it
not
amazing
to
think
the
society
of
Warwick
Lane
 
should
have
no
more
concern
for
the
recovery
of
so
useful
<EOS>
a
member
,
who
,
if
one
may
judge
from
these
appearance
,
would
become
the
great
ornament
to
that
illustrious
body
?
 
<EOS>
another
student
strut
up
fiercely
to
your
tooth
,
puff
with
his
lip
,
half
squeeze
out
his
eye
,
and
very
graciously
hold
out
his
hand
to
kiss
.
 
<EOS>
the
keeper
desire
you
not
to
be
afraid
of
this
professor
,
for
he
will
do
you
no
hurt
;
to
him
alone
be
allow
the
liberty
of
the
ante
-
chamber
,
and
the
orator
of
the
place
give
you
to
understand
that
this
solemn
person
be
a
tailor
run
mad
with
pride
.
<EOS>
this
considerable
student
be
adorn
with
many
other
quality
,
upon
which
at
present
I
shall
not
further
enlarge
.
.
.
.
<EOS>
hark
in
your
ear
.
.
.
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
I
be
strangely
mistake
if
all
his
address
,
his
motion
,
and
his
air
would
not
then
be
very
natural
and
in
their
proper
element
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
not
descend
so
minutely
as
to
insist
upon
the
vast
number
of
beaux
,
fiddler
,
poet
,
and
politician
that
the
world
may
recover
by
such
a
reformation
,
but
what
be
more
material
,
beside
the
clear
gain
redound
to
the
commonwealth
by
so
large
an
acquisition
of
person
to
employ
,
whose
talent
and
acquirement
,
if
I
may
be
so
bold
to
affirm
it
,
be
now
bury
or
at
least
misapplied
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
mighty
advantage
accrue
to
the
public
from
this
inquiry
that
all
these
would
very
much
excel
and
arrive
at
great
perfection
in
their
several
kind
,
which
I
think
be
manif
from
what
I
have
already
show
,
and
shall
enforce
by
this
one
plain
instance
,
that
even
I
myself
,
the
author
of
these
momentous
truth
,
be
a
person
whose
imagination
be
hard
-
mouthed
and
exceedingly
disposed
to
run
away
with
his
reason
,
which
I
have
observe
from
long
experience
to
be
a
very
light
rider
,
and
easily
shake
off
;
upon
which
account
my
friend
will
never
trust
me
alone
without
a
solemn
promise
to
vent
my
speculation
in
this
or
the
like
manner
,
for
the
universal
benefit
of
human
kind
,
which
perhaps
the
gentle
,
courteous
,
and
candid
reader
,
brimful
of
that
modern
charity
and
tenderness
usually
annex
to
his
office
,
will
be
very
hardly
persuade
to
believe

SECTION
X.
 
a
FARTHER
digression
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
an
unanswerable
argument
of
a
very
refined
age
the
wonderful
civility
that
have
pass
of
late
year
between
the
nation
of
author
and
that
of
reader
.
 
<EOS>
there
can
hardly
pop
out
a
play
,
a
pamphlet
,
or
a
poem
without
a
preface
full
of
acknowledgment
to
the
world
for
the
general
reception
and
applause
they
have
give
it
,
which
the
Lord
know
where
,
or
when
,
or
how
,
or
from
whom
it
receive
.
 
<EOS>
in
due
deference
to
so
laudable
a
custom
,
I
do
here
return
my
humble
thank
to
His
Majesty
and
both
Houses
of
Parliament
,
to
the
Lords
of
the
King
's
most
honourable
Privy
Council
,
to
the
reverend
the
Judges
,
to
the
Clergy
,
and
Gentry
,
and
Yeomanry
of
this
land
;
but
in
a
more
especial
manner
to
my
worthy
brother
and
friend
at
Will
's
Coffee
-
house
,
and
Gresham
College
,
and
Warwick
Lane
,
and
Moorfields
,
and
Scotland
Yard
,
and
Westminster
Hall
,
and
Guildhall
;
in
short
,
to
all
inhabitant
and
retainer
whatsoever
,
either
in
court
,
or
church
,
or
camp
,
or
city
,
or
country
,
for
their
generosity
and
universal
acceptance
of
this
divine
treatise
.
 
<EOS>
I
accept
their
approbation
and
good
opinion
with
extreme
gratitude
,
and
to
the
utmost
of
my
poor
capacity
shall
take
hold
of
all
opportunity
to
return
the
obligation
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
also
happy
that
fate
have
fling
me
into
<EOS>
so
bless
an
age
for
the
mutual
felicity
of
bookseller
and
author
,
whom
I
may
safely
affirm
to
be
at
this
day
the
two
only
satisfied
party
in
England
.
<EOS>
ask
an
author
how
his
last
piece
have
succeed
,
"
why
,
truly
he
thank
his
star
the
world
have
be
very
favourable
,
and
he
have
not
the
least
reason
to
complain
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
yet
he
write
it
in
a
week
at
bit
and
start
,
when
he
could
steal
an
hour
from
his
urgent
affair
,
as
it
be
a
hundred
to
one
you
may
see
further
in
the
preface
,
to
which
he
refer
you
,
and
for
the
rest
to
the
bookseller
.
<EOS>
there
you
go
as
a
customer
,
and
make
the
same
question
,
"
He
bless
his
God
<EOS>
the
thing
take
wonderful
;
he
be
just
print
a
second
edition
,
and
have
but
three
leave
in
his
shop
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
beat
down
the
price
;
sir
,
we
shall
not
differ
,
"
and
in
hope
of
your
custom
another
time
,
let
you
have
it
as
reasonable
as
you
please
;
"
<EOS>
and
pray
send
as
many
of
your
acquaintance
as
you
will
<EOS>
;
I
shall
upon
your
account
furnish
them
all
at
the
same
rate
.
"
  
<EOS>
now
it
be
not
well
enough
consider
to
what
accident
and
occasion
<EOS>
the
world
be
indebted
for
the
great
part
of
those
noble
writing
which
hourly
start
up
to
entertain
it
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
be
not
for
a
rainy
day
,
a
drunken
vigil
,
a
fit
of
the
spleen
,
a
course
of
physic
,
a
sleepy
Sunday
,
an
ill
run
at
dice
,
a
long
tailor
's
bill
,
a
beggar
's
purse
,
a
factious
head
,
a
hot
sun
,
costive
diet
,
want
of
book
,
and
a
just
contempt
of
learning
,
 
but
for
these
event
,
I
say
,
and
some
other
too
long
to
recite
(
especially
a
prudent
neglect
of
take
brimstone
inwardly
)
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
the
number
of
author
and
of
writing
would
dwindle
away
to
a
degree
most
woeful
to
behold
.
 
<EOS>
to
confirm
this
opinion
,
hear
the
word
of
the
famous
troglodyte
philosopher
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
certain
,
"
say
he
,
"
some
grain
of
folly
be
of
course
annex
as
part
in
the
composition
of
human
nature
;
only
the
choice
be
leave
us
whether
we
please
to
wear
them
inlaid
or
emboss
,
and
we
need
not
go
very
far
to
seek
how
that
be
usually
determine
,
when
we
remember
it
be
with
human
faculty
as
with
liquor
,
the
light
will
be
ever
at
the
top
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
in
this
famous
island
of
Britain
a
certain
paltry
scribbler
,
very
voluminous
,
whose
character
the
reader
can
not
wholly
be
a
stranger
to
.
 
<EOS>
He
deal
in
a
pernicious
kind
of
writing
call
"
Second
Parts
,
"
and
usually
pass
under
the
name
of
"
the
Author
of
the
first
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
easily
foresee
that
as
soon
as
I
lie
down
my
pen
this
nimble
operator
will
have
steal
it
,
and
treat
me
as
inhumanly
as
he
have
already
do
Dr.
 
Blackmore
,
Lestrange
,
and
many
other
who
shall
here
be
nameless
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
fly
for
justice
and
relief
into
the
hand
of
that
great
rectifier
of
saddle
and
lover
of
mankind
,
Dr.
Bentley
,
beg
he
will
take
this
enormous
grievance
into
his
most
modern
consideration
;
and
if
it
should
so
happen
that
the
furniture
of
an
ass
in
the
shape
of
a
second
part
must
for
my
sin
be
clap
,
by
mistake
,
upon
my
back
,
that
he
will
immediately
please
,
in
the
presence
of
the
world
,
to
lighten
me
of
the
burthen
,
and
take
it
home
to
his
own
house
till
the
true
beast
think
fit
to
call
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
meantime
,
I
do
here
give
this
public
notice
that
my
resolution
be
to
circumscribe
within
this
discourse
the
whole
stock
of
matter
I
have
be
so
many
year
provide
.
 
<EOS>
since
my
vein
be
once
open
,
I
be
content
to
exhaust
it
all
at
a
running
,
for
the
peculiar
advantage
of
my
dear
country
,
and
for
the
universal
benefit
of
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
hospitably
consider
the
number
of
my
guest
,
they
shall
have
my
whole
entertainment
at
a
meal
,
and
I
scorn
to
set
up
the
leaving
in
the
cupboard
.
 
<EOS>
what
the
guest
can
not
eat
may
be
give
to
the
poor
,
and
the
dog
under
the
table
may
gnaw
the
bone
.
 
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
I
understand
for
a
more
generous
proceeding
than
to
turn
the
company
's
stomach
by
invite
them
again
to
-
morrow
to
a
scurvy
meal
of
scrap
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
reader
fairly
consider
the
strength
of
what
I
have
advance
in
the
foregoing
section
,
I
be
convince
it
will
produce
a
wonderful
revolution
in
his
notion
and
opinion
,
and
he
will
be
abundantly
better
prepared
to
receive
and
to
relish
the
conclude
part
of
this
miraculous
treatise
.
 
<EOS>
reader
may
be
divide
into
three
class
 
the
superficial
,
the
ignorant
,
and
the
learn
,
and
I
have
with
much
felicity
fit
my
pen
to
the
genius
and
advantage
of
each
.
 
<EOS>
the
superficial
reader
will
be
strangely
provoke
to
laughter
,
which
clear
the
breast
and
the
lung
,
be
sovereign
against
the
spleen
,
and
the
most
innocent
of
all
diuretic
.
 
<EOS>
the
ignorant
reader
(
between
whom
and
<EOS>
the
former
the
distinction
be
extremely
nice
)
will
find
himself
disposed
to
stare
,
which
be
an
admirable
remedy
for
ill
eye
,
serve
to
raise
and
enliven
the
spirit
,
and
wonderfully
help
perspiration
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
reader
truly
learn
,
chiefly
for
whose
benefit
I
wake
when
other
sleep
,
and
sleep
<EOS>
when
other
wake
,
will
here
find
sufficient
matter
to
employ
his
speculation
for
the
rest
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
much
to
be
wish
,
and
I
do
here
humbly
propose
for
an
experiment
,
that
every
prince
in
Christendom
will
take
seven
of
the
deep
scholar
in
his
dominion
and
shut
them
up
close
for
seven
year
in
seven
chamber
,
with
a
command
to
write
seven
ample
commentary
on
this
comprehensive
discourse
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
venture
to
affirm
<EOS>
that
,
whatever
difference
may
be
find
in
their
several
conjecture
,
they
will
be
all
,
without
the
least
distortion
,
manifestly
deducible
from
the
text
.
 
<EOS>
meantime
it
be
my
earnest
request
that
so
useful
an
undertaking
may
be
enter
upon
(
if
their
Majesties
please
)
with
all
convenient
speed
,
because
I
have
a
strong
inclination
before
I
leave
the
world
to
taste
a
blessing
which
we
mysterious
writer
can
seldom
reach
till
we
have
get
into
our
grave
,
whether
it
be
that
fame
be
a
fruit
graft
on
the
body
,
can
hardly
grow
and
much
less
ripen
till
the
stock
be
in
the
earth
,
or
whether
she
be
a
bird
of
prey
,
and
be
lure
among
the
rest
to
pursue
after
the
scent
of
a
carcass
,
or
whether
she
conceive
her
trumpet
sound
good
and
farth
when
she
stand
on
a
tomb
,
by
the
advantage
of
a
rise
ground
and
the
echo
of
a
hollow
vault
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
indeed
,
the
republic
of
dark
author
,
after
they
once
find
out
this
excellent
expedient
of
die
,
have
be
peculiarly
happy
in
the
variety
as
well
as
extent
of
their
reputation
.
 
<EOS>
for
night
be
the
universal
mother
of
thing
,
wise
philosopher
hold
all
writing
to
be
fruitful
in
the
proportion
they
be
dark
,
and
therefore
the
true
illuminate
(
that
be
to
say
,
the
dark
of
all
)
have
meet
with
such
numberless
commentator
,
whose
scholiastic
midwifery
hath
deliver
them
of
meaning
that
the
author
themselves
perhaps
never
conceive
,
and
yet
may
very
justly
be
allow
the
lawful
parent
of
them
,
the
word
of
such
writer
be
like
seed
,
which
,
however
scatter
at
random
,
when
they
light
upon
a
fruitful
ground
,
will
multiply
far
beyond
either
the
hope
or

of
the

<EOS>
and
therefore
,
in
order
to
promote
so
useful
a
work
,
I
will
here
take
leave
to
glance
a
few
innuendos
that
may
be
of
great
assistance
to
those
sublime
spirit
who
shall
be
appoint
to
labour
in
a
universal
comment
upon
this
wonderful
discourse
.
 
<EOS>
and
first
,
I
have
couch
a
very
profound
mystery
in
the
number
of
0
's
multiply
by
seven
and
divide
by
nine
.
 
<EOS>
also
,
if
a
devout
brother
of
the
Rosy
Cross
will
pray
fervently
for
sixty
-
three
morning
with
a
lively
faith
,
and
then
transpose
certain
letter
and
syllable
accord
to
prescription
,
in
the
second
and
fifth
section
they
will
certainly
reveal
into
a
full
receipt
of
the
opus
magnum
.
 
<EOS>
lastly
,
whoever
will
be
at
the
pain
to
calculate
the
whole
number
of
each
letter
in
this
treatise
,
and
sum
up
the
difference
exactly
between
the
several
number
,
assign
the
true
natural
cause
for
every
such
difference
,
the
discovery
in
the
product
will
plentifully
reward
his
labour
.
<EOS>
but
then
he
must
beware
of
Bythus
and
Sige
,
and
be
sure
not
to
forget
the
quality
of
Acamoth
;
a
cujus
lacrymis
humecta
prodit
substantia
,
a
risu
lucida
,
a
tristitia
solida
,
et
a
timore
mobilis
,
wherein
Eugenius
Philalethes
 
hath
commit
an
unpardonable
mistake
.
  
<EOS>
section
XI
.
 
<EOS>
a
tale
of
a
tub
.
  
<EOS>
after
so
wide
a
compass
as
I
have
wander
,
I
do
now
gladly
overtake
and
close
in
with
my
subject
,
and
shall
henceforth
hold
on
with
it
<EOS>
an
even
pace
to
the
end
of
my
journey
,
except
some
beautiful
prospect
appear
within
sight
of
my
way
,
whereof
,
though
at
present
I
have
neither
warning
nor
expectation
,
yet
upon
such
an
accident
,
come
when
it
will
,
I
shall
beg
my
reader
's
favour
and
company
,
allow
me
to
conduct
him
through
it
along
with
myself
.
 
<EOS>
for
in
write
it
be
as
in
travel
.
 
<EOS>
if
a
man
be
in
haste
to
be
at
home
(
<EOS>
which
I
acknowledge
to
be
none
of
my
case
,
have
never
so
little
business
as
when
I
be
there
)
,
if
his
horse
be
tired
with
long
riding
and
ill
way
,
or
be
naturally
a
jade
,
I
advise
him
clearly
to
make
the
straight
and
the
common
road
,
be
it
ever
so
dirty
;
but
then
surely
we
must
own
such
a
man
to
be
a
scurvy
companion
at
best
.
<EOS>
He
spatter
himself
and
his
fellow
-
traveller
at
every
step
.
 
<EOS>
all
their
thought
,
and
wish
,
and
conversation
turn
entirely
upon
the
subject
of
their
journey
's
end
,
and
at
every
splash
,
and
plunge
,
and
stumble
they
heartily
wish
one
another
at
the
devil
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
other
side
,
when
a
traveller
and
his
horse
be
in
heart
and
plight
,
when
his
purse
be
full
and
the
day
before
him
,
he
take
the
road
only
where
it
be
clean
or
convenient
,
entertain
his
company
there
as
agreeably
as
he
can
,
but
upon
the
first
occasion
carry
them
along
with
him
to
every
delightful
scene
in
view
,
whether
of
art
,
of
nature
,
or
of
both
;
and
if
they
chance
to
refuse
out
of
stupidity
or
weariness
,
let
them
jog
on
by
themselves
,
and
be
d
 
n'd
.
<EOS>
He
will
overtake
them
at
the
next
town
,
at
which
arrive
,
he
ride
furiously
through
,
the
man
,
woman
,
and
child
run
out
to
gaze
,
a
hundred
noisy
cur
run
bark
after
him
,
of
which
,
if
he
honour
the
bold
with
a
lash
of
his
whip
,
it
be
rather
out
of
sport
than
revenge
.
 
<EOS>
but
should
some
sourer
mongrel
dare
too
near
an
approach
,
he
receive
a
salute
on
the
chap
by
an
accidental
stroke
from
the
courser
's
heel
,
nor
be
any
ground
lose
by
the
blow
,
which
send
him
yelp
and
limp
home
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
proceed
to
sum
up
the
singular
adventure
of
my
renowned
Jack
,
the
state
of
whose
disposition
and
fortune
the
careful
reader
do
,
no
doubt
,
most
exactly
remember
,
as
I
last
part
with
them
in
the
conclusion
of
a
former
section
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
,
his
next
care
must
be
from
two
of
the
foregoing
to
extract
a
scheme
of
notion
that
may
best
fit
his
understanding
for
a
true
relish
of
what
be
to
ensue
.
  
<EOS>
Jack
have
not
only
calculate
the
first
revolution
of
his
brain
so
prudently
as
to
give
rise
to
that
epidemic
sect
of
AEolists
,
but
succeed
also
into
a
new
and
strange
variety
of
conception
,
the
fruitfulness
of
his
imagination
lead
him
into
certain
notion
which
,
although
in
appearance
very
unaccountable
,
be
not
without
their
mystery
and
their
meaning
,
nor
want
follower
to
countenance
and
improve
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
therefore
be
extremely
careful
and
exact
in
recount
such
material
passage
of
this
nature
as
I
have
be
able
to
collect
either
from
undoubted
tradition
or
indefatigable
reading
,
and
shall
describe
them
as
graphically
as
it
be
possible
,
and
as
far
as
notion
of
that
height
and
latitude
can
be
bring
within
the
compass
of
a
pen
.
 
<EOS>
nor
do
I
at
all
question
but
they
will
furnish
plenty
of
noble
matter
for
such
whose
convert
imagination
dispose
them
to
reduce
all
thing
into
type
,
who
can
make
shadow
 
no
thank
to
the
sun
 
<EOS>
and
then
mould
them
into
substance
 
<EOS>
no
thank
to
philosophy
 
whose
peculiar
talent
lie
in
fix
trope
and
allegory
to
the
letter
,
and
refining
what
be
literal
into
figure
and
mystery
.
  
<EOS>
Jack
have
provide
a
fair
copy
of
his
father
's
will
,
engross
in
form
upon
a
large
skin
of
parchment
,
and
resolve
to
act
the
part
of
a
most
dutiful
son
<EOS>
,
he
become
the
fond
creature
of
it
imaginable
.
 
<EOS>
for
although
,
as
I
have
often
tell
the
reader
,
it
consist
wholly
in
certain
plain
,
easy
direction
about
the
management
and
wear
of
their
coat
,
with
legacy
and
penalty
in
case
of
obedience
or
neglect
,
yet
he
begin
to
entertain
a
fancy
that
the
matter
be
deep
and
dark
,
and
therefore
must
need
have
a
great
deal
more
of
mystery
at
the
bottom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
will
prove
this
very
skin
of
parchment
to
be
meat
,
drink
,
and
cloth
,
to
be
the
philosopher
's
stone
and
the
universal
medicine
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
consequence
of
which
rapture
he
resolve
to
make
use
of
it
in
the
most
necessary
as
well
as
the
most
paltry
occasion
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
way
of
work
it
into
any
shape
he
please
,
so
that
it
serve
him
for
a
nightcap
when
he
go
to
bed
,
and
for
an
umbrella
in
rainy
weather
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
lap
a
piece
of
it
about
a
sore
toe
;
or
,
when
he
have
fit
,
burn
two
inch
under
his
nose
;
or
,
if
anything
lie
heavy
on
his
stomach
,
scrape
off
and
swallow
as
much
of
the
powder
as
would
lie
on
a
silver
penny
 
they
be
all
infallible
remedy
.
<EOS>
with
analogy
to
these
refinement
,
his
common
talk
and
conversation
run
wholly
in
the
praise
of
his
Will
,
and
he
circumscribe
the
utmost
of
his
eloquence
within
that
compass
,
not
daring
to
let
slip
a
syllable
without
authority
from
thence
.
 
<EOS>
once
at
a
strange
house
he
be
suddenly
take
short
upon
an
urgent
juncture
,
whereon
it
may
not
be
allow
too
particularly
to
dilate
,
and
be
not
able
to
call
to
mind
,
with
that
suddenness
the
occasion
require
,
an
authentic
phrase
for
demand
the
way
to
the
back
,
he
choose
rather
,
as
the
more
prudent
course
,
to
incur
the
penalty
in
such
case
usually
annex
;
neither
be
it
possible
for
the
united
rhetoric
of
mankind
to
prevail
with
him
to
make
himself
clean
again
,
because
,
have
consult
the
will
upon
this
emergency
,
he
meet
with
a
passage
near
the
bottom
(
whether
foist
in
by
the
transcriber
be
not
know
)
which
seem
to
forbid
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
make
it
a
part
of
his
religion
never
to
say
grace
to
his
meat
,
nor
could
all
the
world
persuade
him
,
as
the
common
phrase
be
,
to
eat
his
victual
like
a
Christian
.
  
<EOS>
He
bear
a
strange
kind
of
appetite
to
snap
-
dragon
and
to
the
livid
snuff
of
a
burn
candle
,
which
he
would
catch
and
swallow
with
an
agility
wonderful
to
conceive
;
and
by
this
procedure
maintain
a
perpetual
flame
in
his
belly
,
which
issue
in
a
glowing
steam
from
both
his
eye
,
as
well
as
his
nostril
and
his
mouth
,
make
his
head
appear
in
a
dark
night
like
the
skull
of
an
ass
wherein
a
roguish
boy
hath
convey
a
farthing
-
candle
,
to
the
terror
of
his
Majesty
's
liege
subject
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
he
make
use
of
no
other
expedient
to
light
himself
home
,
but
be
will
not
to
say
that
a
wise
man
be
his
own
lanthorn
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
shut
his
eye
as
he
walk
along
the
street
,
and
if
he
happen
to
bounce
his
head
against
a
post
or
fall
into
the
kennel
(
as
he
seldom
miss
either
to
do
one
or
both
)
,
he
would
tell
the
gibe
apprentice
who
look
on
that
he
submit
with
entire
resignation
,
as
to
a
trip
or
a
blow
of
fate
,
with
whom
he
find
by
long
experience
how
vain
it
be
either
to
wrestle
or
to
cuff
,
and
whoever
durst
undertake
to
do
either
would
be
sure
to
come
off
with
a
swinge
fall
or
a
bloody
nose
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
ordain
,
"
say
he
,
"
some
few
day
before
the
creation
,
that
my
nose
and
this
very
post
should
have
a
rencounter
,
and
therefore
Providence
think
fit
to
send
us
both
into
the
world
in
the
same
age
,
and
to
make
us
countryman
and
fellow
-
citizen
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
have
my
eye
be
open
,
it
be
very
likely
the
business
may
have
be
a
great
deal
bad
,
for
how
many
a
confounded
slip
be
daily
get
by
man
with
all
his
foresight
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
the
eye
of
the
understanding
see
best
when
those
of
the
sense
be
out
of
the
way
,
and
therefore
blind
man
be
observe
to
tread
their
step
with
much
more
caution
,
and
conduct
,
and
judgment
than
those
who
rely
with
too
much
confidence
upon
the
virtue
of
the
visual
nerve
,
which
every
little
accident
shake
out
of
order
,
and
a
drop
or
a
film
can
wholly
disconcert
;
like
a
lanthorn
among
a
pack
of
roar
bully
when
they
scour
the
street
,
expose
its
owner
and
itself
to
outward
kick
and
buffet
,
which
both
may
have
escape
if
the
vanity
of
appear
would
have
suffer
them
to
walk
in
the
dark
.
 
<EOS>
but
further
,
if
we
examine
the
conduct
of
these
boast
light
,
it
will
prove
yet
a
great
deal
bad
than
their
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
I
have
break
my
nose
against
this
post
,
because
Providence
either
forget
,
or
do
not
think
it
convenient
,
to
twitch
me
by
the
elbow
and
give
me
notice
to
avoid
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
let
not
this
encourage
either
the
present
age
of
posterity
to
trust
their
nose
unto
the
keeping
of
their
eye
,
which
may
prove
the
fair
way
of
lose
them
for
good
and
all
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
o
ye
eye
,
ye
blind
guide
,
miserable
guardian
be
ye
of
our
frail
nose
;
ye
,
I
say
,
who
fasten
upon
the
first
precipice
in
view
,
and
then
tow
our
wretched
willing
body
after
you
to
the
very
brink
of
destruction
.
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
that
brink
be
rotten
,
our
foot
slip
,
and
we
tumble
down
prone
into
a
gulf
,
without
one
hospitable
shrub
in
the
way
to
break
the
fall
 
a
fall
to
which
not
any
nose
of
mortal
make
be
equal
,
except
that
of
the
giant
Laurcalco
,
who
be
Lord
of
the
Silver
Bridge
.
 
<EOS>
most
properly
,
therefore
,
o
eye
,
and
with
great
justice
,
may
you
be
compare
to
those
foolish
light
which
conduct
man
through
dirt
and
darkness
till
they
fall
into
a
deep
pit
or
a
noisome
bog
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
I
have
produce
as
a
scantling
of
Jack
's
great
eloquence
and
the
force
of
his
reasoning
upon
such
abstruse
matter
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
,
besides
,
a
person
of
great
design
and
improvement
in
affair
of
devotion
,
have
introduce
a
new
deity
,
who
have
since
meet
with
a
vast
number
of
worshipper
,
by
some
call
Babel
,
by
other
Chaos
,
who
have
an
ancient
temple
of
gothic
structure
upon
Salisbury
plain
,
famous
for
its
shrine
and
celebration
by
pilgrim
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
some
roguish
trick
to
play
,
he
would
down
with
his
knee
,
up
with
his
eye
,
and
fall
to
prayer
though
in
the
midst
of
the
kennel
.
 
<EOS>
then
it
be
that
those
who
understand
his
prank
would
be
sure
to
get
far
enough
out
of
his
way
;
and
whenever
curiosity
attract
stranger
to
laugh
or
to
listen
,
he
would
of
a
sudden
bespatter
them
with
mud
.
  
<EOS>
in
winter
he
go
always
loose
and
unbuttoned
,
and
clothe
as
thin
as
possible
to
let
in
the
ambient
heat
,
and
in
summer
lap
himself
close
and
thick
to
keep
it
out
.
  
<EOS>
in
all
revolution
of
government
,
he
would
make
his
court
for
the
office
of
hangman
-
general
,
and
in
the
exercise
of
that
dignity
,
wherein
he
be
very
dexterous
,
would
make
use
of
no
other
vizard
than
a
long
prayer
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
a
tongue
so
musculous
and
subtile
,
that
he
could
twist
it
up
into
his
nose
and
deliver
a
strange
kind
of
speech
from
thence
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
also
the
first
in
these
kingdom
who
begin
to
improve
the
spanish
accomplishment
of
braying
;
and
have
large
ear
perpetually
expose
and
erect
,
he
carry
his
art
to
such
a
perfection
,
that
it
be
a
point
of
great
difficulty
to
distinguish
either
by
the
view
or
the
sound
between
the
original
and
the
copy
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
trouble
with
a
disease
the
reverse
to
that
call
the
stinging
of
the
tarantula
,
and
would
run
dog
-
mad
at
the
noise
of
music
,
especially
a
pair
of
bagpipe
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
would
cure
himself
again
by
take
two
or
three
turn
in
Westminster
Hall
,
or
Billingsgate
,
or
in
a
boarding

He
be
a
person
that
fear
no
colour
,
but
mortally
hate
all
,
and
upon
that
account
bear
a
cruel
aversion
to
painter
,
<EOS>
insomuch
that
in
his
paroxysm
as
he
walk
the
street
,
he
would
have
his
pocket
load
with
stone
to
pelt
at
the
sign
.
  
<EOS>
have
from
his
manner
of
live
frequent
occasion
to
wash
himself
,
he
would
often
leap
over
head
and
ear
into
the
water
,
though
it
be
in
the
midst
of
the
winter
,
but
be
always
observe
to
come
out
again
much
dirty
,
if
possible
,
than
he
go
in
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
the
first
that
ever
find
out
the
secret
of
contrive
a
soporiferous
medicine
to
be
convey
in
at
the
ear
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
compound
of
sulphur
and
balm
of
Gilead
,
with
a
little
pilgrim
's
salve
.
  
<EOS>
He
wear
a
large
plaister
of
artificial
caustic
on
his
stomach
,
with
the
fervour
of
which
he
could
set
himself
a
groaning
like
the
famous
board
upon
application
of
a
red
-
hot
iron
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
stand
in
the
turning
of
a
street
,
and
call
to
those
who
pass
by
,
would
cry
to
one
,
"
<EOS>
worthy
sir
,
do
me
the
honour
of

good

to

me
with

"
Madam

shall
I
entreat
a
small

"
 
<EOS>
"
noble

lend
a

for
the

with
that
cane

poor

"
 
<EOS>
and
when
he
have
by
such
earnest
solicitation
make
a
shift
to
procure
a
basting
sufficient
to
swell
up
his
fancy
and
his
side
,
he
would
return
home
extremely
comfort
,
and
full
of
terrible
account
of
what
he
have
undergo
for
the
public
good
.
 
<EOS>
"
observe
this
stroke
,
"
say
he
,
show
his
bare

;
"
a
plaguy
janissary
give
it
me
this
very
morning
at

o'clock

,
with
much
ado
,
I
be
drive
off
the
Great
Turk

<EOS>
Neighbours
mine
,
this
broken
head
deserve
a
plaister
;
have
poor
Jack
be
tender
of
his
noddle
,
you
would
have
see
the
Pope
and
the
french
King
long
before
this
time
of
day
among
your
wife
and
your
warehouse
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
Christians
,
the
Great
Moghul
be
come
as
far
as
Whitechapel
,
and
you
may
thank
these
poor
side
that
he
hath
<EOS>
not
  
God
bless
<EOS>
us
 
already
swallow
up
man
,
woman
,
and
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
highly
worth
observe
the
singular
effect
of
that
aversion
or
antipathy
which
Jack
and
his
brother
Peter
seem
,
even
to
affectation
,
to
bear
towards
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
Peter
have
lately
do
some
roguery
that
force
him
to
abscond
,
and
he
seldom
venture
to
stir
out
before
night
for
fear
of
bailiff
.
 
<EOS>
Their
lodging
be
at
the
two
most
distant
part
of
the
town
from
each
other
,
and
whenever
their
occasion
or
humour
call
them
abroad
,
they
would
make
choice
of
the
odd
,
unlikely
time
,
and
most
uncouth
round
that
they
could
invent
,
that
they
may
be
sure
to
avoid
one
another
.
<EOS>
yet
,
after
all
this
,
it
be
their
perpetual
fortune
to
meet
,
the
reason
of
which
be
easy
enough
to
apprehend
,
for
the
frenzy
and
the
spleen
of
both
have
the
same
foundation
,
we
may
look
upon
them
as
two
pair
of
compass
equally
extend
,
and
the
fix
foot
of
each
remain
in
the
same
centre
,
which
,
though
move
contrary
way
at
first
,
will
be
sure
to
encounter
somewhere
or
other
in
the
circumference
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
it
be
among
the
great
misfortune
of
Jack
to
bear
a
huge
personal
resemblance
with
his
brother
Peter
.
 
<EOS>
Their
humour
and
disposition
be
not
only
the
same
,
but
there
be
a
close
analogy
in
their
shape
,
their
size
,
and
their
mien
;
insomuch
as
nothing
be
more
frequent
than
for
a
bailiff
to
seize
Jack
by
the
shoulder
and
cry
,
"
Mr.
Peter
,
you
be
the
king
's
prisoner
;
"
or
,
at
other
time
,
for
one
of
Peter
's
near
friend
to
accost
Jack
with
open
arm
:
 
"
Dear
Peter
,
I
be
glad
to
see
thee
;
pray
send
me
one
of
your
good
medicine
for
the
worm
.
"
 
<EOS>
this
,
we
may
suppose
,
be
a
mortifying
return
of
those
pain
and
<EOS>
proceeding
Jack
have
labour
in
so
long
,
and
find
how
directly
opposite
all
his
endeavour
have
answer
to
the
sole
end
and
intention
which
he
have
propose
to
himself
,
how
could
it
avoid
have
terrible
effect
upon
a
head
and
heart
so
furnish
as
his
?
 
<EOS>
however
,
the
poor
remainder
of
his
coat
bear
all
the
punishment
.
 
<EOS>
the
orient
sun
never
enter
upon
his
diurnal
progress
without
miss
a
piece
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
hire
a
tailor
to
stitch
up
the
collar
so
close
that
it
be
ready
to
choke
him
,
and
squeeze
out
his
eye
at
such
a
rate
as
one
could
see
nothing
but
the
white
.
 
<EOS>
what
little
be
leave
of
the
main
substance
of
the
coat
he
rub
every
day
for
two
hour
against
a
rough
-
cast
wall
,
in
order
to
grind
away
the
remnant
of
lace
and
embroidery
,
but
at
the
same
time
go
on
with
so
much
violence
that
he
proceed
a
heathen
philosopher
.
 
<EOS>
yet
after
all
he
could
do
of
this
kind
,
the
success
continue
still
to
disappoint
his
expectation
,
for
as
it
be
the
nature
of
rag
to
bear
a
kind
of
mock
resemblance
to
finery
,
there
be
a
sort
of
flutter
appearance
in
both
,
which
be
not
to
be
distinguish
at
a
distance
in
the
dark
or
by
short
-
sight
eye
,
so
in
those
juncture
it
fare
with
Jack
and
his
tatter
,
that
they
offer
to
the
first
view
a
ridiculous
flaunting
,
which
,
assist
the
resemblance
in
person
and
air
,
thwart
all
his
project
of
separation
,
and
leave
so
near
a
similitude
between
them
as
frequently
deceive
the
very
disciple
and
follower
of
both
.
.
.
<EOS>
Desunt
nonnulla
,
.
.
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
sclavonian
proverb
say
well
that
it
be
with
man
as
with
ass
;
whoever
would
keep
them
fast
must
find
a
very
good
hold
at
their
ear
.
 
<EOS>
yet
I
think
we
may
affirm
,
and
it
hath
be
verify
by
repeated
experience
,
that
     
"
effugiet
taman
haec
sceleratus
vincula
Proteus
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
It
be
good
,
therefore
,
to
read
the
maxim
of
our
ancestor
with
great
allowance
to
time
and
person
;
for
if
we
look
into
primitive
record
we
shall
find
that
no
revolution
have
be
so
great
or
so
frequent
as
those
of
human
ear
.
 
<EOS>
in
former
day
there
be
a
curious
invention
to
catch
and
keep
them
,
which
I
think
we
may
justly
reckon
among
the
arte
perditae
;
and
how
can
it
be
otherwise
,
when
in
these
latter
centurie
the
very
specie
be
not
only
diminish
to
a
very
lamentable
degree
,
but
the
poor
remainder
be
also
degenerate
so
far
as
to
mock
our
skilfull
tenure
?
 
<EOS>
for
if
only
the
slitting
of
one
ear
in
a
stag
hath
be
find
sufficient
to
propagate
the
defect
through
a
whole
forest
,
why
should
we
wonder
at
the
great
consequence
,
from
so
many
lopping
and
mutilation
to
which
the
ear
of
our
father
and
our
own
have
be
of
late
so
much
expose
?
<EOS>
It
be
true
,
indeed
,
that
while
this
island
of
our
be
under
the
dominion
of
grace
,
many
endeavour
be
make
to
improve
the
growth
of
ear
once
more
among
us
.
 
<EOS>
the
proportion
of
largeness
be
not
only
look
upon
as
an
ornament
of
the
outward
man
,
but
as
a
type
of
grace
in
the
inward
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
it
be
hold
by
naturalist
that
if
there
be
a
protuberancy
of
part
in
the
superior
region
of
the
body
,
as
in
the
ear
and
nose
,
there
must
be
a
parity
also
in
the
inferior
;
and
therefore
in
that
truly
pious
age
the
male
in
every
assembly
,
accord
as
they
be
gift
,
appear
very
forward
in
expose
their
ear
to
view
,
and
the
region
about
them
;
because
hippocrate
 
tell
us
that
when
the
vein
behind
the
ear
happen
to
be
cut
,
a
man
become
a
eunuch
,
and
the
female
be
nothing
backwarder
in
behold
and
edify
by
them
;
whereof
those
who
have
already
use
the
mean
look
about
them
with
great
concern
,
in
hope
of
conceive
a
suitable
offspring
by
such
a
prospect
;
other
,
who
stand
candidate
for
benevolence
,
find
there
a
plentiful
choice
,
and
be
sure
to
fix
upon
such
as
discover
the
large
ear
,
that
the
breed
may
not
dwindle
between
them
.
<EOS>
lastly
,
the
devouter
sister
,
who
look
upon
all
extraordinary
dilatation
of
that
member
as
protrusion
of
zeal
,
or
spiritual
excrescence
,
be
sure
to
honour
every
head
they
sit
upon
as
if
they
have
be
cloven
tongue
,
but
especially
that
of
the
preacher
,
whose
ear
be
usually
of
the
prime
magnitude
,
which
upon
that
account
he
be
very
frequent
and
exact
in
expose
with
all
advantage
to
the
people
in
his
rhetorical
paroxysm
,
turn
sometimes
to
hold
forth
the
one
,
and
sometimes
to
hold
forth
the
other
;
from
which
custom
the
whole
operation
of
preaching
be
to
this
very
day
among
their
professor
style
by
the
phrase
of
hold
forth
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
progress
of
the
saint
for
advance
the
size
of
that
member
,
and
it
be
think
the
success
would
have
be
every
way
answerable
,
if
in
process
of
time
a
cruel
king
have
not
arise
,
who
raise
a
bloody
persecution
against
all
ear
above
a
certain
standard
;
upon
which
some
be
glad
to
hide
their
flourish
sprout
in
a
black
border
,
other
creep
wholly
under
a
periwig
;
some
be
slit
,
other
crop
,
and
a
great
number
slice
off
to
the
stump
.
 
<EOS>
but
of
this
more
hereafter
in
my
general
"
history
of
ear
,
"
which
I
design
very
speedily
to
bestow
upon
the
public
.
  
<EOS>
from
this
brief
survey
of
the
fall
state
of
ear
in
the
last
age
,
and
the
small
care
have
to
advance
their
ancient
growth
in
the
present
,
it
be
manifest
how
little
reason
we
can
have
to
rely
upon
a
hold
so
short
,
so
weak
,
and
so
slippery
;
and
that
whoever
desire
to
catch
mankind
fast
must
have
recourse
to
some
other
method
.
 
<EOS>
now
he
that
will
examine
human
nature
with
circumspection
enough
may
discover
several
handle
,
whereof
the
six
 
sense
afford
one
apiece
,
beside
a
great
number
that
be
screw
to
the
passion
,
and
some
few
rivet
to
the
intellect
.
 
<EOS>
among
these
last
,
curiosity
be
one
,
and
of
all
other
afford
the
firm
grasp
;
curiosity
,
that
spur
in
the
side
,
that
bridle
in
the
mouth
,
that
ring
in
the
nose
of
a
lazy
,
an
impatient
,
and
a
grunting
reader
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
handle
it
be
that
an
author
should
seize
upon
his
reader
;
which
as
soon
as
he
hath
once
compass
,
all
resistance
and
struggling
be
in
vain
,
and
they
become
his
prisoner
as
close
as
he
please
,
till
weariness
or
dulness
force
him
to
let
go
his
grip
.
  
<EOS>
and
therefore
I
,
the
author
of
this
miraculous
treatise
,
have
hitherto
,
beyond
expectation
,
maintain
by
the
aforesaid
handle
a
firm
hold
upon
my
gentle
reader
<EOS>
,
it
be
with
great
reluctance
that
I
be
at
length
compel
to
remit
my
grasp
,
leave
them
in
the
perusal
of
what
remain
to
that
natural
oscitancy
inherent
in
the
tribe
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
only
assure
thee
,
courteous
reader
,
for
both
our
comfort
,
that
my
concern
be
altogether
equal
to
thine
,
for
my
unhappiness
in
lose
or
mislay
among
my
paper
the
remain
part
of
these
memoir
,
which
consist
of
accident
,
turn
,
and
adventure
,
both
new
,
agreeable
,
and
surprising
,
and
therefore
calculate
in
all
due
point
to
the
delicate
taste
of
this
our
noble
age
.
 
<EOS>
but
alas
!
<EOS>
with
my
utmost
endeavour
I
have
be
able
only
to
retain
a
few
of
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
under
which
there
be
a
full
account
how
Peter
get
a
protection
out
of
the
King
's
Bench
,
and
of
a
reconcilement
between
Jack
and
him
,
upon
a
design
they
have
in
a
certain
rainy
night
to
trepan
brother
Martin
into
a
spunging
-
house
,
and
there
strip
him
to
the
skin
.
 
<EOS>
how
Martin
,
with
much
ado
,
show
them
both
a
fair
pair
of
heel
.
 
<EOS>
how
a
new
warrant
come
out
against
Peter
,
upon
which
Jack
leave
him
in
the
lurch
,
steal
his
protection
,
and
make
use
of
it
himself
.
 
<EOS>
how
Jack
's
tatter
come
into
fashion
in
court
and
city
;
how
he
get
upon
a
great
horse
and
eat
custard
.
<EOS>
but
the
particular
of
all
these
,
with
several
other
which
have
now
slide
out
of
my
memory
,
be
lose
beyond
all
hope
of
recovery
.
 
<EOS>
for
which
misfortune
,
leave
my
reader
to
condole
with
each
other
as
far
as
they
shall
find
it
to
agree
with
their
several
constitution
,
but
conjure
them
by
all
the
friendship
that
have
pass
between
us
,
from
the
title
-
page
to
this
,
not
to
proceed
so
far
as
to
injure
their
health
for
an
accident
past
remedy
,
I
now
go
on
to
the
ceremonial
part
of
an
accomplished
writer
,
and
therefore
by
a
courtly
modern
least
of
all
other
to
be
omit
.
  
<EOS>
the
conclusion
.
  
<EOS>
go
too
long
be
a
cause
of
abortion
as
effectual
,
though
not
so
frequent
,
as
go
too
short
,
and
hold
true
especially
in
the
labour
of
the
brain
.
 
<EOS>
well
fare
the
heart
of
that
noble
Jesuit
 
<EOS>
who
first
adventure
to
confess
in
print
that
book
must
be
suit
to
their
several
season
,
like
dress
,
and
diet
,
and
diversion
;
and
well
fare
our
noble
notion
for
refining
upon
this
among
other
french
mode
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
live
fast
to
see
the
time
when
a
book
that
miss
its
tide
shall
be
neglect
as
the
moon
by
day
,
or
like
mackerel
a
week
after
the
season
.
 
<EOS>
no
man
have
more
nicely
observe
our
climate
than
the
bookseller
who
buy
the
copy
of
this
work
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
to
a
tittle
what
subject
will
best
go
off
in
a
dry
year
,
and
which
it
be
proper
to
expose
foremost
when
the
weather
-
glass
be
fall
to
much
rain
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
see
this
treatise
and
consult
his
almanac
upon
it
,
he
give
me
to
understand
that
he
have
manifestly
consider
the
two
principal
thing
,
which
be
the
bulk
and
the
subject
,
and
find
it
would
never
take
but
after
a
long
vacation
,
and
then
only
in
case
it
should
happen
to
be
a
hard
year
for
turnip
.
 
<EOS>
upon
which
I
desire
to
know
,
consider
my
urgent
necessity
,
what
he
think
may
be
acceptable
this
month
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
westward
and
say
,
"
I
doubt
we
shall
have
a
bit
of
bad
weather
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
if
you
could
prepare
some
pretty
little
banter
(
but
not
in
verse
)
,
or
a
small
treatise
upon
the
it
would
run
like
wildfire
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
it
hold
up
,
I
have
already
hire
an
author
to
write
something
against
Dr.
Bentley
,
which
I
be
sure
will
turn
to
account
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
length
we
agree
upon
this
expedient
,
that
when
a
customer
come
for
one
of
these
,
and
desire
in
confidence
to
know
the
author
,
he
will
tell
him
very
privately
as
a
friend
,
name
whichever
of
the
wit
shall
happen
to
be
that
week
in
the
vogue
,
and
if
Durfey
's
last
play
should
be
in
course
,
I
have
as
lieve
he
may
be
the
person
as
Congreve
.
 
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
I
mention
,
because
I
be
wonderfully
well
acquaint
with
the
present
relish
of
courteous
reader
,
and
have
often
observe
,
with
singular
pleasure
,
that
a
fly
drive
from
a
honey
-
pot
will
immediately
,
with
very
good
appetite
,
alight
and
finish
his
meal
on
an
excrement
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
one
word
to
say
upon
the
subject
of
profound
writer
,
who
be
grow
very
numerous
of
late
,
and
I
know
very
well
the
judicious
world
be
resolve
to
list
me
in
that
number
.
 
<EOS>
I
conceive
,
therefore
,
as
to
the
business
of
be
profound
,
that
it
be
with
writer
as
with
well
.
 
<EOS>
a
person
with
good
eye
can
see
to
the
bottom
of
the
deep
,
provide
any
water
be
there
;
and
that
often
when
there
be
nothing
in
the
world
at
the
bottom
besides
dryness
and
dirt
,
though
it
be
but
a
yard
and
half
under
ground
,
it
shall
pass
,
however
,
for
wondrous
deep
,
upon
no
wise
a
reason
than
because
it
be
wondrous
dark
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
now
try
an
experiment
very
frequent
among
modern
author
,
which
be
to
write
upon
nothing
,
when
the
subject
be
utterly
exhausted
to
let
the
pen
still
move
on
;
by
some
call
the
ghost
of
wit
,
delight
to
walk
after
the
death
of
its
body
.
 
<EOS>
and
to
say
the
truth
,
there
seem
to
be
no
part
of
knowledge
in
few
hand
than
that
of
discern
when
to
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
by
the
time
that
an
author
have
write
out
a
book
,
he
and
his
reader
be
become
old
acquaintance
,
and
grow
very
loathe
to
part
;
so
that
I
have
sometimes
know
it
to
be
in
writing
as
in
visit
,
where
the
ceremony
of
take
leave
have
employ
more
time
than
the
whole
conversation
before
.
 
<EOS>
the
conclusion
of
a
treatise
resemble
the
conclusion
of
human
life
,
which
have
sometimes
be
compare
to
the
end
of
a
feast
,
where
few
be
satisfied
to
depart
ut
plenus
vitae
conviva
.
 
<EOS>
for
man
will
sit
down
after
the
full
meal
,
though
it
be
only
to
dose
or
to
sleep
out
the
rest
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
this
latter
I
differ
extremely
from
other
writer
,
and
shall
be
too
proud
if
,
by
all
my
labour
,
I
can
have
any
way
contribute
to
the
repose
of
mankind
in
time
so
turbulent
and
unquiet
as
these
.
 
<EOS>
neither
<EOS>
do
I
think
such
an
employment
so
very
alien
from
the
office
of
a
wit
as
some
would
suppose
;
for
among
a
very
polite
nation
in
Greece
 
there
be
the
same
temple
build
and
consecrate
to
Sleep
and
the
Muses
,
between
which
two
deity
they
believe
the
strict
friendship
be
establish
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
one
conclude
favour
to
request
of
my
reader
,
that
he
will
not
expect
to
be
equally
divert
and
inform
by
every
line
or
every
page
of
this
discourse
,
but
give
some
allowance
to
the
author
's
spleen
and
short
fit
or
interval
of
dulness
,
as
well
as
his
own
,
and
lie
it
seriously
to
his
conscience
whether
,
if
he
be
walk
the
street
in
dirty
weather
or
a
rainy
day
,
he
would
allow
it
fair
dealing
in
folk
at
their
ease
from
a
window
,
to
criticise
his
gate
and
ridicule
his
dress
at
such
a
juncture
.
  
<EOS>
in
my
disposure
of
employment
of
the
brain
,
I
have
think
fit
to
make
invention
the
master
,
and
to
give
method
and
reason
the
office
of
its
lackey
.
 
<EOS>
the
cause
of
this
distribution
be
from
observe
it
my
peculiar
case
to
be
often
under
a
temptation
of
be
witty
upon
occasion
where
I
could
be
neither
wise
nor
sound
,
nor
anything
to
the
matter
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
too
much
a
servant
of
the
modern
way
to
neglect
any
such
opportunity
,
whatever
pain
or
impropriety
<EOS>
I
may
be
at
to
introduce
them
.
 
<EOS>
for
I
have
observe
that
from
a
laborious
collection
of
seven
hundred
and
thirty
-
eight
flower
and
shine
hint
of
the
good
modern
author
,
digest
with
great
reading
into
my
book
of
common
place
,
I
have
not
be
able
after
five
year
to
draw
,
hook
,
or
force
into
common
conversation
any
more
than
a
dozen
.
 
<EOS>
of
which
dozen
the
one
moiety
fail
of
success
by
be
drop
among
unsuitable
company
,
and
the
other
cost
me
so
many
strain
,
and
trap
,
and
ambage
to
introduce
,
that
I
at
length
resolve
to
give
it
over
.
 
<EOS>
now
this
disappointment
(
to
discover
a
secret
)
,
I
must
own
,
give
me
the
first
hint
of
set
up
for
an
author
,
and
I
have
since
find
among
some
particular
friend
that
it
be
become
a
very
general
complaint
,
and
have
produce
the
same
effect
upon
many
other
.
 
<EOS>
for
I
have
remark
many
a
towardly
word
to
be
wholly
neglect
or
despise
in
discourse
,
which
hath
pass
very
smoothly
with
some
consideration
and
esteem
after
its
preferment
and
sanction
in
print
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
,
since
,
by
the
liberty
and
encouragement
of
the
press
,
I
be
grow
absolute
master
of
the
occasion
and
opportunity
to
expose
the
talent
I
have
acquire
<EOS>
,
I
already
discover
that
the
issue
of
my
observanda
begin
to
grow
too
large
for
the
receipt
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
I
shall
here
<EOS>
pause
<EOS>
awhile
,
till
I
find
,
by
feel
the
world
's
pulse
and
my
own
,
that
it
will
be
of
absolute
necessity
for
us
both
to
resume
my
pen

by

prove
themselves

to
be
spurious

northward
,
and
find
the
Thuringians
,
a
neighbour
people
,
dispose
to
change
,
he
set
up
his
stage
first
among
them

where
,
make
it
his
business
to
cry
down
Peter
's
powder
,
plaster

salve

off
,
the
good
people

<EOS>
how
several
great

take
the

account
declare
for
Martin
;
particularly
one

want
to
marry
a

grant
such
license
but
at
a
swingeing
price
,
he
strike
up
a
bargain
with
Martin
,
whom
he
find
more
tractable
,
and
who
assure
him
he
have
the
same
power
to
allow
such
thing
.
 
<EOS>
how
most
of
the
other
northern
lord
,
for
their
own
private
end
,
withdraw
themselves
and
their
dependant
from
Peter

authority
,
and
close
in
with
Martin

many
of
Jack

take
a
liking

they
afterwards
bring

of
Peter
