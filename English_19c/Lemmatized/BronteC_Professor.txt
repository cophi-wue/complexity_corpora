   
<EOS>
the
other
day
,
in
look
over
my
paper
,
I
find
in
my
desk
the
follow
copy
of
a
letter
,
send
by
me
a
year
since
to
an
old
school
acquaintance
:
    
"
dear
charle
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
when
you
and
I
be
at
Eton
together
,
we
be
neither
of
us
what
could
be
call
popular
character
:
you
be
a
sarcastic
,
observant
,
shrewd
,
cold
-
blooded
creature
;
my
own
portrait
I
will
not
attempt
to
draw
,
but
<EOS>
I
can
not
recollect
that
it
be
a
strikingly
attractive
one
 
<EOS>
can
you
?
<EOS>
what
animal
magnetism
draw
thee
and
me
together
I
know
not
;
certainly
I
never
experience
anything
of
the
Pylades
and
Orestes
sentiment
for
you
,
and
I
have
reason
to
believe
that
you
,
on
your
part
,
be
equally
free
from
all
romantic
regard
to
me
.
<EOS>
still
,
out
of
school
hour
we
walk
and
talk
continually
together
;
when
the
theme
of
conversation
be
our
companion
or
our
master
we
understand
each
other
,
and
when
I
recur
to
some
sentiment
of
affection
,
some
vague
love
of
an
excellent
or
beautiful
object
,
whether
in
animate
or
inanimate
nature
,
your
sardonic
coldness
do
not
move
me
.
<EOS>
I
feel
myself
superior
to
that
check
then
as
I
do
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
long
time
since
I
write
to
you
,
and
a
still
long
time
since
I
see
you
.
<EOS>
chance
to
take
up
a
newspaper
of
your
county
the
other
day
,
my
eye
fall
upon
your
name
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
of
old
time
;
to
run
over
the
event
which
have
transpire
since
we
separate
;
and
I
sit
down
and
commence
this
letter
.
<EOS>
what
you
have
be
do
<EOS>
I
know
not
<EOS>
;
but
you
shall
hear
,
if
you
choose
to
listen
,
how
the
world
have
wag
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
first
,
after
leave
Eton
,
I
have
an
interview
with
my
maternal
uncle
,
Lord
Tynedale
and
the
Hon
.
<EOS>
John
Seacombe
.
<EOS>
They
ask
me
if
I
would
enter
the
Church
,
and
my
uncle
the
nobleman
offer
me
the
living
of
Seacombe
,
which
be
in
his
gift
,
if
I
would
;
then
my
other
uncle
,
Mr.
Seacombe
,
hint
that
when
I
become
rector
of
Seacombe
-
cum
-
Scaife
,
I
may
perhaps
be
allow
to
take
,
as
mistress
of
my
house
and
head
of
my
parish
,
one
of
my
six
cousin
,
his
daughter
,
all
of
whom
I
greatly
dislike
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
decline
both
the
Church
and
matrimony
.
<EOS>
a
good
clergyman
be
a
good
thing
,
but
I
should
have
make
a
very
bad
one
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
wife
 
<EOS>
oh
how
like
a
night
-
mare
be
the
thought
of
be
bind
for
life
to
one
of
my
cousin
!
<EOS>
no
doubt
they
be
accomplished
and
pretty
;
but
not
an
accomplishment
,
not
a
charm
of
theirs
,
touch
a
chord
in
my
bosom
.
<EOS>
to
think
of
pass
the
winter
evening
by
the
parlour
fire
-
side
of
Seacombe
Rectory
alone
with
one
of
them
 
for
instance
,
the
large
and
well
-
model
statue
,
<EOS>
Sarah
 
<EOS>
no
;
I
should
be
a
bad
husband
,
under
such
circumstance
,
as
well
as
a
bad
clergyman
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
I
have
decline
my
uncle
'
offer
they
ask
me
"
what
I
intend
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
say
I
should
reflect
.
<EOS>
They
remind
me
that
I
have
no
fortune
,
and
no
expectation
of
any
,
and
,
after
a
considerable
pause
,
Lord
Tynedale
demand
sternly
,
"
whether
I
have
thought
of
follow
my
father
's
step
and
engage
in
trade
?
"
<EOS>
now
,
I
have
have
no
thought
of
the
sort
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
my
turn
of
mind
qualify
me
to
make
a
good
tradesman
;
my
taste
,
my
ambition
do
not
lie
in
that
way
;
but
such
be
the
scorn
express
in
Lord
Tynedale
's
countenance
as
he
pronounce
the
word
trade
 
<EOS>
such
the
contemptuous
sarcasm
of
his
tone
 
that
I
be
instantly
decide
.
<EOS>
My
father
be
but
a
name
to
me
,
yet
that
name
I
do
not
like
to
hear
mention
with
a
sneer
to
my
very
face
.
<EOS>
I
answer
then
,
with
haste
and
warmth
,
"
I
can
not
do
better
than
follow
in
my
father
's
step
;
yes
,
I
will
be
a
tradesman
.
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
do
not
remonstrate
;
they
and
I
part
with
mutual
disgust
.
<EOS>
in
review
this
transaction
,
I
find
that
I
be
quite
right
to
shake
off
the
burden
of
Tynedale
's
patronage
,
but
a
fool
to
offer
my
shoulder
instantly
for
the
reception
of
another
burden
 
one
which
may
be
more
intolerable
,
and
which
certainly
be
yet
untrie
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
write
instantly
to
Edward
 
<EOS>
you
know
Edward
 
<EOS>
my
only
brother
,
ten
year
my
senior
,
marry
to
a
rich
mill
-
owner
's
daughter
,
and
now
possessor
of
the
mill
and
business
which
be
my
father
's
before
he
fail
.
<EOS>
You
be
aware
that
my
father
 
once
reckon
a
Croesus
of
wealth
 
become
bankrupt
a
short
time
previous
to
his
death
,
and
that
my
mother
live
in
destitution
for
some
six
month
after
him
,
unhelpe
by
her
aristocratical
brother
,
whom
she
have
mortally
offend
by
her
union
with
Crimsworth
,
the
 
shire
manufacturer
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
the
six
month
she
bring
me
into
the
world
,
and
then
herself
leave
it
without
<EOS>
,
I
should
think
,
much
regret
,
as
it
contain
little
hope
or
comfort
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
's
relation
take
charge
of
Edward
,
as
they
do
of
me
,
till
I
be
nine
year
old
.
<EOS>
at
that
period
it
chance
that
the
representation
of
an
important
borough
in
our
county
fall
vacant
;
Mr.
Seacombe
stand
for
it
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
Crimsworth
,
an
astute
mercantile
man
,
take
the
opportunity
of
write
a
fierce
letter
to
the
candidate
,
state
that
if
he
and
Lord
Tynedale
do
not
consent
to
do
something
towards
the
support
of
their
sister
's
orphan
child
,
he
would
expose
their
relentless
and
malignant
conduct
towards
that
sister
,
and
do
his
good
to
turn
the
circumstance
against
Mr.
Seacombe
's
election
.
<EOS>
that
gentleman
and
Lord
T.
know
well
enough
that
the
Crimsworths
be
an
unscrupulous
and
determined
race
;
they
know
also
that
they
have
influence
in
the
borough
of
X
 
;
and
,
make
a
virtue
of
necessity
,
they
consent
to
defray
the
expense
of
my
education
.
<EOS>
I
be
send
to
Eton
,
where
I
remain
ten
year
,
during
which
space
of
time
Edward
and
I
never
meet
.
<EOS>
He
,
when
he
grow
up
,
enter
into
trade
,
and
pursue
his
calling
with
such
diligence
,
ability
,
and
success
,
that
now
,
in
his
thirtieth
year
,
he
be
fast
make
a
fortune
.
<EOS>
of
this
I
be
apprise
by
the
occasional
short
letter
I
receive
from
him
,
some
three
or
four
time
a
year
;
which
say
letter
never
conclude
without
some
expression
of
determined
enmity
against
the
house
of
Seacombe
,
and
some
reproach
to
me
for
live
,
as
he
say
,
on
the
bounty
of
that
house
.
<EOS>
at
first
,
while
still
in
boyhood
,
I
could
not
understand
why
,
as
I
have
no
parent
,
I
should
not
be
indebted
to
my
uncle
Tynedale
and
Seacombe
for
my
education
;
but
as
I
grow
up
,
and
hear
by
degree
of
the
persevere
hostility
,
the
hatred
till
death
evince
by
them
against
my
father
 
of
the
suffering
of
my
mother
 
of
all
the
wrong
,
in
short
,
of
our
house
 
then
do
I
conceive
shame
of
the
dependence
in
which
I
live
,
and
form
a
resolution
no
more
to
take
bread
from
hand
which
have
refuse
to
minister
to
the
necessity
of
my
die
mother
.
<EOS>
It
be
by
these
feeling
I
be
influence
when
I
refuse
the
Rectory
of
Seacombe
,
and
the
union
with
one
of
my
patrician
cousin
.
  
<EOS>
"
an
irreparable
breach
thus
be
effect
between
my
uncle
and
myself
,
I
write
to
Edward
;
tell
him
what
have
occur
,
and
inform
him
of
my
intention
to
follow
his
step
and
be
a
tradesman
.
<EOS>
I
ask
,
moreover
,
if
he
could
give
me
employment
.
<EOS>
His
answer
express
no
approbation
of
my
conduct
,
but
he
say
I
may
come
down
to
shire
,
if
I
like
,
and
he
would
"
see
what
could
be
do
in
the
way
of
furnish
me
with
work
.
<EOS>
"
I
repress
all
 
even
mental
comment
on
his
note
 
pack
my
trunk
and
carpet
-
bag
,
and
start
for
the
North
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
after
two
day
'
travelling
(
railroad
be
not
then
in
existence
)
<EOS>
I
arrive
,
one
wet
October
afternoon
,
in
the
town
of
X
 
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
understand
that
Edward
live
in
this
town
,
but
on
inquiry
I
find
that
it
be
only
Mr.
Crimsworth
's
mill
and
warehouse
which
be
situate
in
the
smoky
atmosphere
of
Bigben
Close
;
his
RESIDENCE
lie
four
mile
out
,
in
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
late
in
the
evening
when
I
alight
at
the
gate
of
the
habitation
designate
to
me
as
my
brother
's
.
<EOS>
as
I
advance
up
the
avenue
,
I
could
see
through
the
shade
of
twilight
,
and
the
dark
gloomy
mist
which
deepen
those
shade
,
that
the
house
be
large
,
and
the
ground
surround
it
sufficiently
spacious
.
<EOS>
I
pause
a
moment
on
the
lawn
in
front
,
and
lean
my
back
against
a
tall
tree
which
rise
in
the
centre
<EOS>
,
I
gaze
with
interest
on
the
exterior
of
Crimsworth
Hall
.
  
<EOS>
"
Edward
be
rich
,
"
think
I
to
myself
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
him
to
be
do
well
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
know
he
be
master
of
a
mansion
like
this
.
<EOS>
"
cut
short
all
marvelling
;
speculation
,
conjecture
,
&
c.
,
I
advance
to
the
front
door
and
rang
.
<EOS>
a
man
-
servant
open
it
 
<EOS>
I
announce
myself
 
he
relieve
me
of
my
wet
cloak
and
carpet
-
bag
,
and
usher
me
into
a
room
furnish
as
a
library
,
where
there
be
a
bright
fire
and
candle
burn
on
the
table
;
he
inform
me
that
his
master
be
not
yet
return
from
X
 
market
,
but
that
he
would
certainly
be
at
home
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
leave
to
myself
,
I
take
the
stuffed
easy
chair
,
cover
with
red
morocco
,
which
stand
by
the
fireside
,
and
while
my
eye
watch
the
flame
dart
from
the
glow
coal
,
and
the
cinder
fall
at
interval
on
the
hearth
,
my
mind
busy
itself
in
conjecture

the
meeting
about
to
take
place
.
<EOS>
amidst
much
that
be
doubtful
in
the
subject
of
these
conjecture
,
there
be
one
thing
tolerably
certain
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
no
danger
of
encounter
severe
disappointment
;
from
this
,
the
moderation
of
my
expectation
guarantee
me
.
<EOS>
I
anticipate
no
overflowing
of
fraternal
tenderness
;
Edward
's
letter
have
always
be
such
as
to
prevent
the
engendering
or
harbouring
of
delusion
of
this
sort
.
<EOS>
still
,
as
I
sit
await
his
arrival
,
I
feel
eager
 
very
eager
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
you
why
;
my
hand
,
so
utterly
a
stranger
to
the
grasp
of
a
kindred
hand
,
clench
itself
to
repress
the
tremor
with
which
impatience
would
fain
have
shake
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
of
my
uncle
;
and
as
I
be
engage
in
wonder
whether
Edward
's
indifference
would
equal
the
cold
disdain
I
have
always
experience
from
them
,
I
hear
the
avenue
gate
open
<EOS>
:
wheel
approach
the
house
;
Mr.
Crimsworth
be
arrive
;
and
after
the
lapse
of
some
minute
,
and
a
brief
dialogue
between
himself
and
his
servant
in
the
hall
,
his
tread
draw
near
the
library
door
 
<EOS>
that
tread
alone
announce
the
master
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
still
retain
some
confused
recollection
of
Edward
as
he
be
ten
year
ago
 
a
tall
,
wiry
,
raw
youth
;
now
,
as
I
rise
from
my
seat
and
turn
towards
the
library
door
,
I
see
a
fine
-
looking
and
powerful
man
,
light
-
complexioned
,
well
-
make
,
and
of
athletic
proportion
;
the
first
glance
make
me
aware
of
an
air
of
promptitude
and
sharpness
,
show
as
well
in
his
movement
as
in
his
port
,
his
eye
,
and
the
general
expression
of
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
greet
me
with
brevity
,
and
,
in
the
moment
of
shake
hand
,
scan
me
from
head
to
foot
;
he
take
his
seat
in
the
morocco
<EOS>
cover
arm
-
chair
,
and
motion
me
to
another
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
expect
you
would
have
call
at
the
counting

house
in
the
Close

"
say
he
;
and
his
voice
<EOS>
,
I
notice
,
have
an
abrupt
accent
,
probably
habitual
to
him
;
he
speak
also
with
a
guttural
northern
tone
,
which
sound
harsh
in
my
ear
,
accustom
to
the
silvery
utterance
of
the
South
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
the
landlord
of
the
inn
,
where
the
coach
stop
,
direct
me
here
,
"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
at
first
the
accuracy
of
his
information
,
not
be
aware
that
you
have
such
a
residence
as
this
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
"
oh
,
it
be
all
right
!
"
<EOS>
he
reply
,
"
only
I
be
keep
half
an
hour
behind
time

wait
for
you
 
that
be
all

you
must
be
come
by
the
eight
o'clock
coach

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
express
regret
that
he
have
have
to
wait
;
he
make
no
answer
,
but
stir
the
fire
,
as
if
to
cover
a
movement
of
impatience
;
then
he
scan
me
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
an
inward
satisfaction
that
I

not

in
the
first
moment
of
meeting
,
betray
any
warmth

any
enthusiasm
;
that
I
have
salute
this
man
with
a
quiet
and
steady
phlegm

"
have
you
quite
broken
with
Tynedale

Seacombe

he
ask
hastily
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
do
not
think
I
shall
have
any
further
communication
with
them
;
my
refusal
of
their
proposal
will
,
I
fancy
,
operate
as
a
barrier
against
all
future
intercourse

no

I
content
myself
with
an
inward
speculation
on
the
difference
which

in

constitution

<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
inference
Mr.
Crimsworth
draw
from
my
silence
 
whether
he
consider
it
a
symptom
of
contumacity

an
evidence
of
my

peremptory
manner

He
stride
from

in

wonder

handsome

fashionable

so
much
my
first
glance
suffice
to
ascertain
.
<EOS>
a
gay
salutation
pass
between
her
and
Mr.
Crimsworth
;
she
chide
him
,
half
playfully
,
half
poutingly
,
for
be
late
;
her
voice
(
I
always
take
voice
into
the
account
in
judging
of
character
)
be
lively
 
<EOS>
it
indicate
,
I
think
,
good
animal
spirit
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crimsworth
soon
check
her
animate
scold
with
a
kiss
 
a
kiss
that
still
tell
of
the
bridegroom
(
they
have
not

take

first

rate
spirit

<EOS>
perceive
me
,
she
beg
my
pardon
for
not
notice
me
before
,
and
then
shake
hand
with
me
,
as
lady
do
when
a
flow
of
good

humour
dispose
them
to
be
cheerful
to
all
,
even
the
most
indifferent
of
their
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
further
obvious
to
me
that
she
have
a
good
complexion
,
and
feature
sufficiently
mark
but
agreeable
;
her
hair
be
red
 
quite
red
.
<EOS>
She
and
Edward
talk
much
,
always
in
a
vein
of
playful
contention
;
she
be
vex
,
or
pretend
to
be
vex
,
that
he
have
that
day
drive
a
vicious
horse
in
the
gig

he
make
light
of
her
fear

sometimes
she
appeal
to
me

<EOS>
"
"
now
,
Mr.
William
,
be
not
it
absurd
in
Edward
to
talk
so
?
<EOS>
He
say
he
will
drive
Jack

throw
him
twice

She
speak
with
a
kind
of
lisp
,
not
disagreeable
,
but
childish
.
<EOS>
I
soon
see
also
that
there
be
more
than
girlish
 
<EOS>
a
somewhat
infantine
expression
in
her
by
no
means
small
feature
;
this
lisp
and
expression
be
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
a
charm
in
Edward
's
eye
,
and
would
be
so
to
those
of
most
man
,
but
they
be
not
to
mine
.
<EOS>
I
seek
her
eye
,
desirous
to
read
there
the
intelligence
which
I
could
not
discern
in
her
face
or
hear
in
her
conversation
;
it
be
merry
,
rather
small
;
by
turn
I
see
vivacity
,
vanity
,
coquetry
,
look
out
through
its
irid
,
but
I
watch
in
vain
for
a
glimpse
of

I
be
no

white
neck
,
carmine

of
bright
curl

do
not
suffice
for
me
without
that
promethean
spark

will
live
after

fade
,
the
burnished
hair
grow
grey

how

there
in

have
peruse
the
fair
page
of

involuntary

take
it

I
turn
from

bend
my

the
examination

They

portrait

the
benefit

softly
shade

<EOS>
I
presently
recognise
her

I
have
see
this

how

I
appreciate
keenly

<EOS>
a
FINE
October
morning
succeed
to
the
foggy
evening
that
have
witness
my
first
introduction
to
Crimsworth
Hall

<EOS>
I
be
early
up
and
walk
in
the
large
park
-
like
meadow
surround
the
house
.
<EOS>
the
autumn
sun
,
rise
over
the
shire

,
disclose
a
pleasant
country
;
wood
brown
and
mellow

the

a
river

glide
between

wood
,
catch
on

the
somewhat
cold
gleam

sky
;
at
frequent
interval
along
the
bank
of

river
,
tall

almost
like

a

active

<EOS>

,

<EOS>
at
a
distance
of
five
mile
,
a
valley
,
opening
between
the
low
hill
,
hold
in
its
cup
the

a
dense
,
permanent
vapour
brood
over
this
locality
 
there
lie
Edward

"
Concern

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
force
my
eye
to
scrutinize
this
prospect
,
I
force
my
mind
to
dwell
on
it
for
a
time
,
and
when
I
find
that
it
communicate
no
pleasurable
emotion

that
it
stir
in

none

I

to

,
"

you

<EOS>
I
continue
mentally
 
<EOS>
"
look
at

I
return
to

<EOS>
My
brother
be
in
the
breakfast

room
.
<EOS>
I
meet
him
collectedly
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
meet
him
cheerfully
;
he
be
stand
on
the
rug
,
his
back
to
the
fire
 
<EOS>
how
much
do
I
read
in
the
expression
of
his
eye
as
my
glance
encounter
his
,
when
I
advance
to
bid
him
good
morning
;
how
much
that
be
contradictory
to
my
nature
!
<EOS>
He
say
"
good
morning
"
abruptly
and
nod
,
and
then
he
snatch
,
rather
than
take
,
a
newspaper
from
the
table
,
and
begin
to
read
it
with
the
air
of
a
master
who
seize
a
pretext
to
escape
the
bore
of
converse
with
an
underling
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
I
have
take
a
resolution
to
endure
for
a
time
,
or
his
manner
would
have
go
far
to
render
insupportable
the
disgust
I
have
just
be
endeavour
to
subdue
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
him
:
<EOS>
I
measure
his
robust
frame
and
powerful
proportion
;
I
see
my
own
reflection
in
the
mirror
over
the
mantel

piece
;
I
amuse
myself
with
compare
the
two
picture
.
<EOS>
in
face
I
resemble
him
,
though
I
be
not
so
handsome
;
my
feature
be
less
regular
;
I
have
a
dark
eye
,
and
a
broad
brow
 
in
form
<EOS>
I
be
greatly
inferior
 
<EOS>
thinner

slighter
,
not
so
tall

<EOS>
as
an
animal

Edward
excel
me
far
;
should
he
prove
as
paramount
in
mind
as
in
person
I
must
be
a
slave
 
<EOS>
for
I
must
expect
from
him
no
lion
-
like
generosity
to
one
weak
than
himself
;
his
cold
,
avaricious
eye
,
his
stern
,
forbidding
manner
tell
me
he
would
not
spare
.
<EOS>
have
I
then
force
of
mind
to
cope
with
him
?

I

not

I
have
never

<EOS>
Mrs.
Crimsworth
's
entrance
divert
my
thought
for
a
moment

<EOS>
She
look
well
,
dress
in
white
,
her
face
and
her
attire
shine
in
morning
and
bridal
freshness

<EOS>
I
address
her
with
the
degree
of
ease
her
last
night
's
careless
gaiety
seem
to
warrant
,
but
she
reply
with
coolness
and
restraint
:
her
husband
have
tutor
her
;
she
be
not
to
be
too
familiar
with
his
clerk
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
breakfast
be
over

intimate
to
me
that
they
be

the
gig
round

door

that
in

go
down
with
him
to
X

<EOS>
I
do
not
keep
him

;
we
be
soon
dash
at
a
rapid
rate
along
the
road
.
<EOS>
the
horse
he
drive
be
the
same
vicious
animal
about
which
Mrs.
Crimsworth
have
express
her
fear
the
night
before
.
<EOS>
once
or
twice
Jack
seem
disposed
to
turn
restive
,
but
a
vigorous
and
determined
application
of
the
whip
from
the
ruthless
hand
of
his
master
soon
compel
him
to
submission
,
and
Edward
's
dilate
nostril
express
his
triumph
in
the
result
of
the
contest
;
he
scarcely
speak
to
me
during
the
whole
of
the
brief
drive
,
only
open
his
lip
at
interval
to
damn
his
horse
.
  
<EOS>
X
be
all
stir

bustle
when

it
;
we
leave
the
clean
street
where
there
be
dwelling

house
and
shop
,
church
,
and
public
building
;
we
leave
all
these

and
turn
down
to
a
region
of
mill
and
warehouse

thence
we
pass
through
two
massive

Crimsworth
look
from
side

side

seem
at
one
glance
to
comprehend
all

rise
and

close
the

as

go
out

<EOS>
Mr.
Crimsworth
stir
the
fire
,
then
fold
his
arm
,
and
sit
a
moment
thinking
,
his
lip
compress
,
his
brow
knit
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
do
but
<EOS>
to
watch
him
 
how
well
his
feature
be
cut
!
<EOS>
what
a
handsome
man
he
be
!
<EOS>
Whence
,
then
,
come
that
air
of
contraction
 
that
narrow
and
hard
aspect
on
his
forehead
,
in
all
his
lineament

<EOS>
turn
to
me
he
begin
abruptly
:
  
"
You

<EOS>
"
yes

"
have
you

<EOS>
"
yes

<EOS>
I

<EOS>

He

moment

then
open
a

out
a

"
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
It

<EOS>
"
It

after

"

once

<EOS>
I
must
have
no

I

excuse

I

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
I
turn
on
my

walk
to

this

I
do
not

<EOS>
what
it

<EOS>
I
do
not

nor

<EOS>
after
a
silence
of
some
minute
he
recommence
:
    
"
You

expect

<EOS>
I
wish
you
,
however
,
to
be
aware
that
such
an

would
be
quite
inconvenient

I
like
to
have
the
seat
in
my
gig
at
liberty
for
any
gentleman
whom
for
business
reason
I
may
wish
to
take
down

so

You

<EOS>
quit

I
walk
back
to
the
hearth

<EOS>
"
of

I

I
answer

"
It

<EOS>
My
tone
be
quiet

<EOS>
I
always
speak
quietly

<EOS>
yet
Mr.
Crimsworth
's
blue
eye
become
incensed
;
he
take
his
revenge
rather
oddly
.
<EOS>
turn
to
me
he
say
bluntly
    
<EOS>
"
You
be
poor

"
for

I

no

<EOS>
I
do
not
think
the

come

much
parley

<EOS>
I
have
an
instinctive
feeling
that
it
would
be
folly
to
let
one
's
temper
effervesce
often
with
such
a
man
as
Edward

<EOS>
I
say
to
myself
,
"
I
will
place
my
cup
under
this
continual
dropping

it

stand
there
still

steady

run
over

patience

<EOS>
two
thing
be
certain
.
<EOS>
I
be
capable
of
perform
the
work
Mr.
Crimsworth
have
set
me
;
I
can
earn
my
wage
conscientiously

and
those
wage
be
sufficient
to
enable
me
to
live

<EOS>
as
to
the
fact
of
my
brother
assume
towards
me
the
bearing
of
a
proud
,
harsh
master
,
the
fault
be
his

not
mine
;
and
shall
his
injustice
,
his
bad
feeling
,
turn
me
at
once
aside
from
the
path
I
have
choose
?
<EOS>
no
;
at

,
ere
<EOS>
I
deviate
,
I
will
advance
far
enough
to
see
whither
my
career
tend

<EOS>
as
yet
I
be
only
press
in

entrance
 
a
strait
gate
enough

it
ought
to
have
a
good
terminus
.
<EOS>
"
while
I
thus
reason
,
Mr.
Crimsworth
ring
a
bell
;
his
first
clerk
,
the
individual
dismiss
previously
to
our
conference

"
Mr.
Steighton

Mr.

five

execute
this
order

he
lay
the

desk
,
and
I
be
soon
seat
at
it
,
and
engage
in
render
the
english
answer
into
German
.
<EOS>
a
sentiment
of
keen
pleasure
accompany
this
first
effort
to
earn
my
own
living
 
a
sentiment
neither
poison
nor
weaken
by
the
presence
of
the
taskmaster
,
who
stand
and
watch
me
for
some
time
as
I
write
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
be
try
to
read
my
character
,
but
I
feel
as
secure
against
his
scrutiny
as
if
I
have
have
on
a
casque
with
the
visor
down
 
or
<EOS>
rather
I
show
him
my
countenance
with
the
confidence
that
one
would
show
an
unlearned
man
a
letter
write
in
Greek
;
he
may
see
line
,
and
trace
character
,
but
he
could
make
nothing
of
them
;
my
nature
be
not
his
nature
,
and
its
sign
be
to
him
like
the
word
of
an
unknown
tongue
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
he
turn
away
abruptly
,
as
if
baffle
,
and
leave
the
counting
-
house
;
he
return
to
it
but
twice
in
the
course
of
that
day
;
each
time
he
mix
and
swallow
a
glass
of
brandy
-
and

water
,
the
material
for
make
which
he
extract
from
a
cupboard
on
one
side
of
the
fireplace
;
have
glance
at
my
translation
 
he
could
read
both
french

german
 
he
go
out
again
in
silence

<EOS>
I
serve
Edward
as
his
second
clerk
faithfully
,
punctually
,
diligently
.
<EOS>
what
be
give
me
to
do
<EOS>
I
have
the
power
and
the
determination
to
do
well
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crimsworth
watch
sharply
for
defect
,
but
find
none
;
he
set
Timothy
Steighton
,
his
favourite
and
head
man
,
to
watch
also
.
<EOS>
Tim
be
baffle
;
I
be
as
exact
as
himself
,
and
quicker
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crimsworth
make
inquiry
as
to
how
I
live
,
whether
I
get
into
debt
 
no

my
account
with
my
landlady
be
always
straight

<EOS>
I
have
hire
small
lodging
,
which
I
contrive
to
pay
for
out
of
a
slender
fund
 
the
accumulate
saving
of
my
Eton
pocket
-
money
;
for
as
it
have
ever
be
abhorrent
to
my
nature
to
ask
pecuniary
assistance
,
I
have
early
acquire
habit
of
self
-
deny
economy
;
husband
my
monthly
allowance
with
anxious
care
,
in
order
to
obviate
the
danger
of
be
force
,
in
some
moment
of
future
exigency
,
to
beg
additional
aid
.
<EOS>
I
remember
many
call
me
miser
at
the
time
,
and
I
use
to
couple
the
reproach
with
this
consolation
 
better
to
be
misunderstood
now
than
repulse
hereafter
.
<EOS>
at
this
day
I
have
my
reward
;
I
have
have
it
before

when
on
part
with
my
irritated
uncle
one

them
throw
down
on
the
table
before

<EOS>
note

I

<EOS>
Mr.
Crimsworth
employ
Tim
to
find
out
whether
my
landlady
have
any
complaint
to
make
on
the
score
of
my
moral
;
she
answer
that
she
believe
I
be
a
very
religious
man

and
ask
Tim
,
in
her
turn
,
if
he
think
I
have
any
intention

go
into

Church
some
day
;
for

she

she
have
have
young

who
be
nothing

steadiness

<EOS>
Tim
be

himself
;
indeed
,
he
be
"
a

Methodist

"
which
do
not
(
be

prevent
him
from
be
at
the
same
time
an
engraine
rascal
,
and
he
come
away
much
pose
at
hear
this
account
of
my
piety
.
<EOS>
have
impart
it
to
Mr.
Crimsworth
,
that
gentleman
,
who
himself
frequent
no
place
of
worship
,
and
own
no
God
but
Mammon
,
turn
the
information
into
a
weapon
of
attack
against
the
equability
of
my
temper
.
<EOS>
He
commence
a
series
of
covert
sneer
,
of
which
I
do
not
at
first
perceive
the
drift
,
till
my
landlady
happen
to
relate
the
conversation
she
have
have
with
Mr.
Steighton
;
this
enlighten
me
;
afterwards
I
come
to
the
counting

house
prepare
,
and
manage
to
receive
the
millowner

blasphemous
sarcasm
,
when
next
level
at

on
a
buckler
of
impenetrable
indifference

<EOS>
Ere
long
he
tire
of
waste
his
ammunition
on
a

but
he
do
not
throw
away
the

<EOS>
he

<EOS>
once
during
my
clerkship
I
have
an
invitation
to
Crimsworth
Hall
;
it
be
on
the
occasion
of
a
large
party
give
in
honour
of
the
master
's
birthday
;
he
have
always
be
accustomed
to
invite
his
clerk
on
similar
anniversary
,
and
could
not
well
pass
me
over
;
I
be
,
however

keep
strictly
in
the
background
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Crimsworth
,
elegantly
dress
in
satin
and
lace
,
bloom
in
youth
and
health
,
vouchsafe
me
no
more
notice
than
be
express
by
a
distant
move
;
Crimsworth
,
of
course
,
never
speak
to
me
;
I
be
introduce
to
none
of
the
band
of
young
lady
,
who
,
envelop
in
silvery
cloud
of
white
gauze
and
muslin
,
sit
in
array
against
me
on
the
opposite
side
of
a
long
and
large
room
;
in
fact
,
I
be
fairly
isolate
,
and
could
but
contemplate
the
shine
one
from
afar
,
and
when
weary
of
such
a
dazzling
scene
,
turn
for
a
change
to
the
consideration
of
the
carpet
pattern
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crimsworth
,
stand
on
the
rug
,
his
elbow
support
by
the
marble
mantelpiece
,
and
about
him
a
group
of
very
pretty
girl
,
with
whom
he
converse
gaily
 
Mr.
Crimsworth
,
thus
place
,
glance
at
me
;
I
look
weary
,
solitary
,
keep
down
like
some
desolate
tutor
or
governess
;
he
be
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
dancing
begin
;
I
should
have
like
well
enough
to
be
introduce
to
some
pleasing
and
intelligent
girl
,
and
to
have
freedom
and
opportunity
to
show
that
I
could
both
feel
and
communicate
the
pleasure
of
social
intercourse
 
that
I
be
not
,
in
short
,
a
block
,
or
a
piece
of
furniture
,
but
an
acting
,
thinking
,
sentient
man
.
<EOS>
many
smile
face
and
graceful
figure
glide
past
me
,
but
the
smile
be
lavish
on
other
eye
,
the
figure
sustain
by
other
hand
than
mine

<EOS>
I
turn
away
tantalized
,
leave
the
dancer
,
and
wander
into
the
oak

panel
dining

room
.
<EOS>
no
fibre
of
sympathy
unite
me
to
any
live
thing
in
this
house

I
look
for

find
my

<EOS>
I
take
a
wax
taper
from
a

<EOS>
I
gaze
long

earnestly
;
my

My

have
bequeath

softened
and
refined
likeness
of
themselves
;
for
this
reason
,
father
regard
with
complacency
the
lineament
of
their
daughter
'
face
,
where
frequently
their
own
similitude
be
find
flatteringly
associate
with
softness
of
hue
and
delicacy
of
outline
.
<EOS>
I
be
just
wonder
how
that
picture
,
to
me
<EOS>
so
interesting
,
would
strike
an
impartial
spectator
,
when
a
voice
close
behind
me
pronounce
the
word
    
"
Humph
!
<EOS>
there
be
some
sense
in
that
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
turn
;
at
my
elbow
stand
a
tall
man
,
young
,
though
probably
five
or
six
year
old
than
I
 
in
other
respect
of
an
appearance
the
opposite
to
common
place
;
though
just
now
,
as
I
be
not
dispose
to
paint
his
portrait
in
detail
,
the
reader
must
be
content
with
the
silhouette
I
have
just
throw
off
;
it
be
all
I
myself
see
of
him
for
the
moment
:
<EOS>
I
do
not
investigate
the
colour
of
his
eyebrow
,
nor
of
his
eye
either
;
I
see
his
stature
,
and
the
outline
of
his
shape
;
I
see
,
too
,
his
fastidious
-
look
RETROUSSE
nose
;
these
observation
,
few
in
number
,
and
general
in
character
(
the
last
except
)
,
suffice
,
for
they
enable
me
to
recognize
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
evening
,
Mr.
Hunsden
,
"
mutter
I
with
a
bow
,
and
then
,
like
a
shy
noodle
as
I
be
<EOS>
,
I
begin
move
away
 
and
why
?
<EOS>
simply
because
Mr.
Hunsden
be
a
manufacturer
and
a
millowner
,
and
I
be
only
a
clerk
,
and
my
instinct
propel
me
from
my
superior
.
<EOS>
I
have
frequently
see
Hunsden
in
Bigben
Close
,
where
he
come
almost
weekly
to
transact
business
with
Mr.
Crimsworth
,
but
I
have
never
speak
to
him
,
nor
he
to
me
,
and
I
owe
him
a
sort
of
involuntary
grudge
,
because
he
have
more
than
once
be
the
tacit
witness
of
insult
offer
by
Edward
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
conviction
that
he
could
only
regard
me
as
a
poor
-
spirited
slave
,
wherefore
<EOS>
I
now
go
about
to
shun
his
presence
and
eschew
his
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
you
go
?
"
<EOS>
ask
he
,
as
I
edge
off
sideways
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
notice
that
Mr.
Hunsden
indulge
in
abrupt
form
of
speech
,
and
I
perversely
say
to
myself
    
"
<EOS>
He
think
he
may
speak
as
he
like
to
a
poor
clerk
;
but
my
mood
be
not
,
perhaps
,
so
supple
as
he
deem
it
,
and
his
rough
freedom
please
me
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
make
some
slight
reply
,
rather
indifferent
than
courteous
,
and
continue
to
move
away
.
<EOS>
He
coolly
plant
himself
in
my
path
.
  
<EOS>
"
stay
here
awhile
,
"
say
he
:
"
<EOS>
it
be
so
hot
in
the
dancing
-
room
;
besides
,
you
do
not
dance
;
you
have
not
have
a
partner
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
be
right
,
and
as
he
speak
neither
his
look
,
tone
,
nor
manner
displease
me
;
my
AMOUR
-
PROPRE
be
propitiate
;
he
have
not
address
me
out
of
condescension
,
but
because
,
have
repair
to
the
cool
dining
-
room
for
refreshment
,
he
now
want
some
one
to
talk
to
,
by
way
of
temporary
amusement
.
<EOS>
I
hate
to
be
condescend
to
,
but
I
like
well
enough
to
oblige
;
I
stay
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
good
picture
,
"
he
continue
,
recur
to
the
portrait
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
consider
the
face
pretty
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
pretty
!
<EOS>
no
 
<EOS>
how
can
it
be
pretty
,
with
sink
eye
and
hollow
cheek
?
<EOS>
but
it
be
peculiar
;
it
seem
to
think
.
<EOS>
You
could
have
a
talk
with
that
woman
,
if
she
be
alive
,
on
other
subject
than
dress
,
visit
,
and
compliment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
agree
with
him
,
but
do
not
say
so
.
<EOS>
He
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
that
I
admire
a
head
of
that
sort
;
it
want
character
and
force
;
there
be
too
much
of
the
sen
-
si
-
tive
(
so
he
articulate
it
,
curl
his
lip
at
the
same
time
)
in
that
mouth
;
besides
,
there
be
Aristocrat
write
on
the
brow
and
define
in
the
figure
;
I
hate
your
aristocrat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
,
then
,
Mr.
Hunsden
,
that
patrician
descent
may
be
read
in
a
distinctive
cast
of
form
and
feature
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
patrician
descent
be
hang
!
<EOS>
who
doubt
that
your
lordling
may
have
their
"
distinctive
cast
of
form
and
feature
'
as
much
as
we
 
shire
tradesman
have
ours
?
<EOS>
but
which
be
the
good
?
<EOS>
not
theirs
assuredly
.
<EOS>
as
to
their
woman
,
it
be
a
little
different
:
they
cultivate
beauty
from
childhood
upward
,
and
may
by
care
and
training
attain
to
a
certain
degree
of
excellence
in
that
point
,
just
like
the
oriental
odalisque
.
<EOS>
yet
even
this
superiority
be
doubtful
.
<EOS>
compare
the
figure
in
that
frame
with
Mrs.
Edward
Crimsworth
 
which
be
the
fine
animal
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
reply
quietly
:
"
compare
yourself
and
Mr.
Edward
Crimsworth
,
Mr
Hunsden
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Crimsworth
be
better
fill
up
than
I
be
,
I
know
besides
he
have
a
straight
nose
,
arched
eyebrow
,
and
all
that
;
but
these
advantage
 
if
they
be
advantage
 
he
do
not
inherit
from
his
mother
,
the
patrician
,
but
from
his
father
,
old
Crimsworth
,
who
,
my
father
say
,
be
as
veritable
<EOS>
a
shire
blue
-
dyer
as
ever
put
indigo
in
a
vat
yet
withal
the
handsome
man
in
the
three
Ridings
.
<EOS>
It
be
you
,
William
,
who
be
the
aristocrat
of
your
family
,
and
you
be
not
as
fine
a
fellow
as
your
plebeian
brother
by
long
chalk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
Mr.
Hunsden
's
point
-
blank
mode
of
speech
which
rather
please
me
than
otherwise
because
it
set
me
at
my
ease
.
<EOS>
I
continue
the
conversation
with
a
degree
of
interest
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
happen
to
know
that
I
be
Mr.
Crimsworth
's
brother
?
<EOS>
I
think
you
and
everybody
else
look
upon
me
only
in
the
light
of
a
poor
clerk
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
and
so
we
do
;
and
what
be
you
but
a
poor
clerk
?
<EOS>
You
do
Crimsworth
's
work
,
and
he
give
you
wage
 
<EOS>
shabby
wage
they
be
,
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
silent
.
<EOS>
Hunsden
's
language
now
border
on
the
impertinent
,
still
his
manner
do
not
offend
me
in
the
least
 
<EOS>
it
only
pique
my
curiosity
;
I
want
him
to
go
on
,
which
he
do
in
a
little
while
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
world
be
an
absurd
one
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
so
,
Mr.
Hunsden
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
you
should
ask
:
you
be
yourself
a
strong
proof
of
the
absurdity
I
allude
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
determine
he
should
explain
himself
of
his
own
accord
,
without
my
press
him
so
<EOS>
to
do
 
<EOS>
so
I
resume
my
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
your
intention
to
become
a
tradesman
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquire
presently
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
serious
intention
three
month
ago

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Humph

the

you

"
My

if

stay
there

it

<EOS>
"
perhaps
I
have
no

well

I
care
nought

it
will
make

what

but
I
be
cool
now
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
dance
again
;

<EOS>
I
see
such
a
fine
girl
sit
in

corner

sofa
there
by

her
for

there
be
Waddy

Sam
Waddy
make
up
to
her
<EOS>
;
will
not
I
cut
him
out
?
"
  
<EOS>
and
Mr.
Hunsden
stride
away
.
<EOS>
I
watch
him
through
the
open
fold
-
door
;
he
outstrip
Waddy
,
apply
for
the
hand
of
the
fine
girl
,
and
lead
her
off
triumphant
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
tall
,
well
-
make
,
full
-
form
,
dashingly
-
dress
young
woman
,
much
in
the
style
of
Mrs.
E.
Crimsworth
;
Hunsden
whirl
her
through
the
waltz
with
spirit
;
he
keep
at
her
side
during
the
remainder
of
the
evening
,
and
I
read
in
her
animated
and
gratified
countenance
that
he
succeed
in
make
himself
perfectly
agreeable
.
<EOS>
the
mamma
too
(
a
stout
person
in
a
turban
 
Mrs.
Lupton
by
name
)
look
well
pleased
;
prophetic
vision
probably
flatter
her
inward
eye
.
<EOS>
the
Hunsdens
be
of
an
old
stem
;
and
scornful
as
Yorke
(
such
be
my
late
interlocutor
's
name
)
profess
to
be
of
the
advantage
of
birth
,
in
his
secret
heart
he
well
know
and
fully
appreciate
the
distinction
<EOS>
his
ancient
,
if
not
high
lineage
confer
on
him
in
a
mushroom
-
place
like
x
 
,
concern
whose
inhabitant
<EOS>
it
be
proverbially
say
,
that
not
one
in
a
thousand
know
his
own
grandfather
.
<EOS>
moreover
the
Hunsdens
,
once
rich
,
be
still
independent
;
and
report
affirm
that
Yorke
bade
fair
,
by
his
success
in
business
,
to
restore
to
pristine
prosperity
the
partially
decay
fortune
of
his
house
.
<EOS>
these
circumstance
consider
,
Mrs.
Lupton
's
broad
face
may
well
wear
a
smile
of
complacency
as
she
contemplate
the
heir
of
Hunsden
Wood
occupy
in
pay
assiduous
court
to
her
darling
Sarah
Martha
.
<EOS>
I
,
however
,
whose
observation
be
less
anxious
,
be
likely
to
be
more
accurate
,
soon
see
that
the
ground
for
maternal
self
-
congratulation
be
slight
indeed
;
the
gentleman
appear
to
me
much
more
desirous
of
make
,
than
susceptible
of
receive
an
impression
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
it
be
in
Mr.
Hunsden
that
,
as
I
watch
him
(
I
have
nothing
well
to
do
)
,
suggest
to
me
,
every
now
and
then
,
the
idea
of
a
foreigner
.
<EOS>
in
form
and
feature
he
may
be
pronounce
English
,
though
even
there
one
catch
a
dash
of
something
Gallic
;
but
he
have
no
English
shyness
:
he
have
learn
somewhere
,
somehow
,
the
art
of
set
himself
quite
at
his
ease
,
and
of
allow
no
insular
timidity
to
intervene
as
a
barrier
between
him
and
his
convenience
or
pleasure
.
<EOS>
refinement
he
do
not
affect
,
yet
vulgar
he
could
not
be
call
;
he
be
not
odd
 
<EOS>
no
quiz
 
<EOS>
yet
he
resemble
no
one
else
I
have
ever
see
before
;
his
general
bearing
intimate
complete
,
sovereign
satisfaction
with
himself
;
yet
,
at
time
,
an
indescribable
shade
pass
like
an
eclipse
over
his
countenance
,
and
seem
to
me
like
the
sign
of
a
sudden
and
strong
inward
doubt
of
himself
,
his
word
and
action
an
energetic
discontent
at
his
life
or
his
social
position
,
his
future
prospect
or
his
mental
attainment
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
which
;
perhaps
after
all
it
may
only
be
a
bilious
caprice
.
    
<EOS>
no
man
like
to
acknowledge
that
he
have
make
a
mistake
in
the
choice
of
his
profession
,
and
every
man
,
worthy
of
the
name
,
will
row
long
against
wind
and
tide
before
he
allow
himself
to
cry
out
,
"
I
be
baffle
!
"
and
submit
to
be
float
passively
back
to
land
.
<EOS>
from
the
first
week
of
my
residence
in
X
<EOS>
I
feel
my
occupation
irksome
.
<EOS>
the
thing
itself
 
the
work
of
copying
and
translate
business
-
letter
 
be
a
dry
and
tedious
task
enough
,
but
have
that
be
all
,
I
should
long
have
bear
with
the
nuisance
;
I
be
not
of
an
impatient
nature
,
and
influence
by
the
double
desire
of
get
my
living
and
justify
to
myself
and
other
the
resolution
I
have
take
to
become
a
tradesman
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
endure
in
silence
the
rust
and
cramp
of
my
good
faculty
;
I
should
not
have
whisper
,
even
inwardly
,
that
I
long
for
liberty
;
I
should
have
pen
in
every
sigh
by
which
my
heart
may
have
venture
to
intimate
its
distress
under
the
closeness
,
smoke
,
monotony
and
joyless
tumult
of
Bigben
Close
,
and
its
pant
desire
for
free
and
fresher
scene
;
I
should
have
set
up
the
image
of
Duty
,
the
fetish
of
Perseverance
,
in
my
small
bedroom
at
Mrs.
King
's
lodging
,
and
they
two
should
have
be
my
household
god
,
from
which
my
darling
,
my
cherish
-
in
-
secret
,
imagination
,
the
tender
and
the
mighty
,
should
never
,
either
by
softness
or
strength
,
have
sever
me
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
all
;
the
antipathy
which
have
spring
up
between
myself
and
my
employer
strike
deep
root
and
spread
denser
shade
daily
,
exclude
me
from
every
glimpse
of
the
sunshine
of
life
;
and
I
begin
to
feel
like
a
plant
grow
in
humid
darkness
out
of
the
slimy
wall
of
a
well
.
  
<EOS>
Antipathy
be
the
only
word
which
can
express
the
feel
Edward
Crimsworth
have
for
me
 
a
feeling
,
in
a
great
measure
,
involuntary
,
and
which
be
liable
to
be
excite
by
every
,
the
most
trifling
movement
,
look
,
or
word
of
mine
.
<EOS>
My
southern
accent
annoy
him
;
the
degree
of
education
evince
in
my
language
irritate
him
;
my
punctuality
,
industry
,
and
accuracy
,
fix
his
dislike
,
and
give
it
the
high
flavour
and
poignant
relish
of
envy
;
he
fear
that
I
too
should
one
day
make
a

Tact

<EOS>
thought
,
not
varied

strong
,
occupy
my
mind
;
two
voice
speak
within
me
;
again
and
again
they
utter
the
same
monotonous
phrase
.
<EOS>
one
say
:
"
William
,
your
life
be
intolerable
.
"
<EOS>
the
other
:
"
what
can
you
do
to
alter
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
walk
fast
,
for
it
be
a
cold
,
frosty
night
in
January
;
as
I
approach
my
lodging
,
I
turn
from
a
general
view
of
my
affair
to
the
particular
speculation
as
to
whether
my
fire
would
be
out
;
look
towards
the
window
of
my
sitting
-
room
,
I
see
no
cheer
red
gleam
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
slut
of
a
servant
have
neglect
it
as
usual
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
I
shall
see
nothing
but
pale
ashe
if
I
go
in
;
it
be
<EOS>
a
fine
starlight
night
 
I
will
walk
a
little
farther
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
night
,
and
the
street
be
dry
and
even
clean
for
x
 
;
there
be
a
crescent
curve
of
moonlight
to
be
see
by
the
parish
church
tower
,
and
hundred
of
star
shine
keenly
bright
in
all
quarter
of
the
sky
.
  
<EOS>
unconsciously
I
steer
my
course
towards
the
country
;
I
have
get
into
Grove
-
street
,
and
begin
to
feel
the
pleasure
of
see
dim
tree
at
the
extremity
,
round
a
suburban
house
,
when
a
person
lean
over
the
iron
gate
of
one
of
the
small
garden
which
front
the
neat
dwelling
-
house
in
this
street
,
address
me
as
I
be
hurry
with
quick
stride
past
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
the
deuce
be
the
hurry
?
<EOS>
just
so
must
lot
have
leave
Sodom
,
when
he
expect
fire
to
pour
down
upon
it

out

brass

<EOS>
"
  
I
stop
short
,
and
look
towards
the
speaker
.
<EOS>
I
smell
the
fragrance
,
and
see
the
red
spark
of
a
cigar
;
the
dusk
outline
of
a
man
,
too
,
bent
towards
me
over
the
wicket
.
  
<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
"
God
know
it

cool

<EOS>
especially
as

the

me
 
its

me
to
seize
the
speaker

<EOS>
"

<EOS>

It
would
not

so
,
if

step
in

sit
half

an

hour
in
my
bachelor
's
parlour
,
you
may
catch
him
as

without
much
trouble

<EOS>
I
think
though
you
would
better
let
him
alone
to

night
,
he
will
have
so
many
customer
to
serve
;
Tuesday

come

He
swing
the

<EOS>
"
do

I
ask

"
<EOS>
as
you

I

your

me
;
but
,
if
you
do
not
choose
to
favour
me
so
far
,
I
will
not
press
the
point
.
<EOS>
I
hate
to
bore
any
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
suit
me
to
accept
the
invitation
as
it
suit
Hunsden
to
give
it
.
<EOS>
I
pass
through
the
gate
,
and
follow
him
to
the
front
door
,
which
he
open
;
thence
we
traverse
a
passage
,
and
enter
his
parlour
;
the
door
be
shut
,
he
point
me
to
an
arm
-
chair
by
the
hearth
;
I
sit
down
,
and
glance
round
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
comfortable
room
,
at
once
snug
and
handsome
;
the
bright
grate
be
fill
with
a
genuine
shire
fire
,
red
,
clear
,
and
generous
,
no
penurious

heap
in
the
corner
of
a
grate
.
<EOS>
on
the
table
a
shade
lamp
diffuse
around
a
soft
,
pleasant
,
and
equal
light
;
the
furniture
be
almost
luxurious
for
a
young
bachelor
,
comprise
a
couch
and
two
very
easy
chair
;
bookshelf
fill
the
recess
on
each
side
of
the
mantelpiece
;
they
be
well
-
furnish
,
and
arrange
with
perfect
order
.
<EOS>
the
neatness
of
the
room
suit
my
taste
;
I
hate
irregular
and
slovenly
habit
.
<EOS>
from
what
I
see
I
conclude
that
Hunsden
's
idea
on
that
point
correspond
with
my
own
.
<EOS>
while
he
remove
from
the
centre
-
table
to
the
side
-
board
a
few
pamphlet
and
periodical
,
I
run
my
eye
along
the
shelf
of
the
book
-
case
near
me
.
<EOS>
french
and
german
work
predominate
,
the
old
french
dramatist
,
sundry
modern
author
,
Thiers
,
Villemain
,
Paul

Kock
,
George

,
Eugene

in

,
Zschokke
,
Jean

;
in
English
there
be
work
on
Political
Economy
.
<EOS>
I
examine
no
further
,
for
Mr.
Hunsden
himself
recall
my
attention
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
something
,
"
say
he
,
"
<EOS>
for
you
ought
to
feel
disposed
for
refreshment
after
walk
<EOS>
nobody
know
how
far
on
such
a
canadian
night
as
this
;
but
it
shall
not
be
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
it
shall
not
be
a
bottle
of
port
,
nor
ditto
of
sherry
.
<EOS>
I
keep
no
such
poison
.
<EOS>
I
have
Rhein
-
wein
for
my
own
drinking
,
and
you
may
choose
between
that
and
coffee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
here
again
Hunsden
suit
me
:
if
there
be
one
generally
receive
practice
I
abhor
more
than
another
,
it
be
the
habitual
imbibing
of
spirit
and
strong
wine
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
however
,
no
fancy
for
his
acid
german
nectar
,
but
I
like
coffee
,
<EOS>
so
I
respond
    
"
give
me
some
coffee
,
Mr.
Hunsden
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
perceive
my
answer
please
him
<EOS>
;
he
have
doubtless
expect
to
see
a
chilling
effect
produce
by
his
steady
announcement
that
he
would
give
me
neither
wine
nor
spirit
;
he
just
shoot
one
search
glance
at
my
face
to
ascertain
whether
my
cordiality
be
genuine
or
a
mere
feint
of
politeness
.
<EOS>
I
smile
,
because
I
quite
understand
him
;
and
,
while
I
honour
his
conscientious
firmness
,
I
be
amuse
at
his
mistrust
;
he
seem
satisfied
,
rang
the
bell
,
and
order
coffee
,
which
be
presently
bring
;
for
himself
,
a
bunch
of
grape
and
half
a
pint
of
something
sour
sufficed
.
<EOS>
My
coffee
be
excellent
;
I
tell
him
so
,
and
express
the
shudder
pity
with
which
his
anchorite
fare
inspire
me
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
answer
,
and
I
scarcely
think
hear
my
remark
.
<EOS>
at
that
moment
one
of
those
momentary
eclipse
I
before
allude
to
have
come
over
his
face
,
extinguish
his
smile
,
and
replace
,
by
an
abstract
and
alienated
look
,
the
customarily
shrewd
,
banter
glance
of
his
eye
.
<EOS>
I
employ
the
interval
of
silence
in
a
rapid
scrutiny
of
his
physiognomy
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
observe
him
closely
before
;
and
,
as
my
sight
be
very
short
,
I
have
gather
only
a
vague
,
general
idea
of
his
appearance
;
I
be
surprised
now
,
on
examination
,
to
perceive
how
small
,
and
even
feminine
,
be
his
lineament
;
his
tall
figure
,
long
and
dark
lock
,
his
voice
and
general
bearing
,
have
impress
me
with
the
notion
of
something
powerful
and
massive
;
not
at
all
:
 
my
own
feature
be
cast
in
a
harsh
and
squarer
mould
than
his
.
<EOS>
I
discern
that
there
would
be
contrast
between
his
inward
and
outward
man
;
contention
,
too
;
for
I
suspect
his
soul
have
more
of
will
and
ambition
than
his
body
have
of
fibre
and
muscle
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
in
these
incompatibility
of
the
"
physique
"
with
the
"
morale
,
"
lie
the
secret
of
that
fitful
gloom
;
he
WOULD
but
COULD
not
,
and
the
athletic
mind
scowl
scorn
on
its
more
fragile
companion
.
<EOS>
as
to
his
good
look
,
I
should
have
like
to
have
a
woman
's
opinion
on
that
subject
;
it
seem
to
me
that
his
face
may
produce
the
same
effect
on
a
lady
that
a
very
piquant
and
interesting
,
though
scarcely
pretty
,
female
face
would
on
a
man
.
<EOS>
I
have
mention
his
dark
lock
 
they
be
brush
sideway
above
a
white
and
sufficiently
expansive
forehead
;
his
cheek
have
a
rather
hectic
freshness
;
his
feature
may
have
do
well
on
canvas
,
but
indifferently
in
marble
:
they
be
plastic
;
character
have
set
a
stamp
upon
each
;
expression
re
-
cast
them
at
her
pleasure
,
and
strange
metamorphosis
she
work
,
give
him
now
the
mien
of
a
morose
bull
,
and
anon
that
of
an
arch
and
mischievous
girl
;
more
frequently
,
the
two
semblance
be
blent
,
and
a
queer
,
composite
countenance
they
make
.
  
<EOS>
start
from
his
silent
fit
,
he
begin
:
    
"
William
!
<EOS>
what
a
fool
you
be
to
live
in
those
dismal
lodging
of
Mrs.
King
's

when
you
may
take
room
here
in
Grove
Street
,
and
have
a
garden
like
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
too
far
from
the
mill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
It
would
do
you
good
to
walk
there
and
back
two
or
three
time
a
day
;
besides
,
be
you
such
a
fossil
that
you
never
wish
to
see
a
flower
or
a
green
leaf
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
no
fossil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
you
then
?
<EOS>
You
sit
at
that
desk
in
Crimsworth
's
counting
-
house
day
by
day
and
week
by
week
,
scrape
with
a
pen
on
paper
,
just
like
an
automaton
;
you
never
get
up
;
you
never
say
you
be
tired
;
you
never
ask
for
a
holiday
;
you
never
take
change
or
relaxation
;
you
give
way
to
no
excess
of
an
evening
;
you
neither
keep
wild
company
,
nor
indulge
in
strong
drink
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
,
Mr.
Hunsden
?
"
  
"
do
not
think
to
pose
me
with
short
question
;
your
case
and
mine
be
diametrically
different
,
and
it
be
nonsense
attempt
to
draw
a
parallel
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
that
when
a
man
endure
patiently
what
ought
to
be
unendurable
,
he
be
a
fossil
.

<EOS>

whence
do
you
acquire
the
knowledge
of
my
patience
?
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
why
,
man

do
you
suppose
you
be
a
mystery

<EOS>
the
other
night
you
seem
surprised
at
my
knowing
to
what
family
you
belong
;
now
you
find
subject
for
wonderment
in
my
call
you
patient

<EOS>
what
do
you
think
I
do
with
my
eye
and
ear
?
<EOS>
I
have
be
in
your
counting

house
more
than
once
when
Crimsworth
have
treat
you
like
a
dog
;
call
for
a
book

for
instance
,
and
when
you
give
him
the
wrong
one
,
or
what
he
choose
to
consider
the
wrong
one
,
fling
it
back
almost
in
your
face
;
desire
you
to
shut
or
open
the
door
as
if
you
have
be
his
flunkey
;
to
say
nothing
of
your
position
at
the
party
about
a
month
ago
,
where
you
have
neither
place
nor
partner
,
but
hover
about
like
a
poor
,
shabby
hanger
-
on
;
and
how
patient
you
be
under
each
and
all
of
these
circumstance
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Mr.
Hunsden
,
what
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
hardly
tell
you
what
then
;
the
conclusion
to
be
draw
as
to
your
character
depend
upon
the
nature
of
the
motive
which
guide
your

you
expect
to
make
something
eventually
out
of
Crimsworth

notwithstanding
his
tyranny

perhaps
by

of
it
,
you
be
what
the

call

interested

mercenary

may
be

wise

you

it

meet
insult
with
submission

you

essential

no

phlegmatic

inexcitable

you

up

Mr.
Hunsden
's
eloquence
be
not
,
it
will
be
perceive
,
of
the
smooth
and
oily
order
.
<EOS>
as
he
speak
,
he
please
me
ill
.
<EOS>
I
seem
to
recognize
in
him
one
of
those
character
who
,
sensitive
enough
themselves
,
be
selfishly
relentless
towards
the
sensitiveness
of
other
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
though
he
be
neither
like
Crimsworth
nor
Lord
Tynedale
,
yet
he
be
acrid
,
and
,
I
suspect
,
overbear
in
his
way
:
<EOS>
there
be
a
tone
of
despotism
in
the
urgency
of
the
very
reproach
by
which
he
aim
at
goad
the
oppress
into
rebellion
against
the
oppressor
.
<EOS>
look
at
him
still
more
fixedly
than
I
have
yet
do
,
I
see
write
in
his
eye
and
mien
a
resolution
to
arrogate
to
himself
a
freedom
so
unlimited
that
it
may
often
trench
on
the
just
liberty
of
his
neighbour
.
<EOS>
I
rapidly
run
over
these
thought
,
and
then
I
laugh
a
low
and
involuntary
laugh
,
move
thereto
by
a
slight
inward
revelation
of
the
inconsistency
of
man
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
I
think
:
<EOS>
Hunsden
have
expect
me
to
take
with
calm
his
incorrect
and
offensive
surmise
,
his
bitter
and
haughty
taunt
;
and
himself
be
chafe
by
a
laugh
,
scarce
louder
than
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
His
brow
darken
,
his
thin
nostril
dilate
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
he
begin
,
"
I
tell
you
that
you
be
an
aristocrat
,
and
who
but
an
aristocrat
would
laugh
such
a
laugh
as
that
,
and
look
such
a
look
?
<EOS>
a
laugh
frigidly
jeer
;
a
look
lazily
mutinous
;
gentlemanlike
irony
,
patrician
resentment
.
<EOS>
what
a
nobleman
you
would
have
make
,
William
Crimsworth
!
<EOS>
You
be
cut
out
for
one
;
pity
Fortune

baulk
Nature

<EOS>
look
at
the
feature
,
figure
,
even
to
the
hand
 
distinction
all
over
 
ugly
distinction
!
<EOS>
now
,
if
you
would
only
an
estate
and
a
mansion
,
and
a
park
,
and
a
title
,
how
you
could
play
the
exclusive
,
maintain
the
right
of
your
class
,
train
your
tenantry
in
habit
of
respect
to
the
peerage
,
oppose
at
every
step
the
advance
power
of
the
people
,
support
your
rotten
order
,
and
be
ready
for
its
sake
to
wade
knee
-
deep
in
churl
'
blood
;
as
it
be
,
you
have
no
power
;
you
can
do
nothing
;
you
be
wreck
and
strand
on
the
shore
of
commerce
;
force
into
collision
with
practical
man
,
with
whom
you
can
not
cope
,
for
YOU'LL
NEVER
be

"
  
<EOS>
the
first
part
of
Hunsden
's
speech
move
me
not
at
all
,
or
,
if
it
do
,
it
be
only
to
wonder
at
the
perversion
into
which
prejudice
have
twist
his
judgment
of
my
character
;
the
conclude
sentence
,
however
,
not
only
move
,
but
shake
me
;
the
blow
it
give
be
a
severe
one
,
because
Truth
wield
the
weapon
.
<EOS>
if
I
smile
now
,
it
,
be
only
in
disdain
of
myself
.
  
<EOS>
Hunsden
see
his
advantage
;
he
follow
it
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
make
nothing
by
trade
,
"
continue
he
;
"
nothing
more
than
the
crust
of
dry
bread
and
the
draught
of
fair
water
on
which
you
now
live
;
<EOS>
your
only
chance
of
get
a
competency
lie
in
marry
a
rich
widow
,
or
run
away
with
an
heiress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
leave
such
shift
to
be
put
in
practice
by
those
who
devise
them
,
"
say
I
,
rise
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
even
that
be
hopeless
,
"
he
go
on
coolly
.
<EOS>
"
what
widow
would
have
you
?
<EOS>
much
less
,
what
heiress
?
<EOS>
You
be
not
bold
and
venturesome
enough
for
the
one
,
nor
handsome
and
fascinating
enough
for
the
other
.
<EOS>
You
think
perhaps
you
look
intelligent
and
polished
;
carry
your
intellect
and
refinement
to
market
,
and
tell
me
in
a
private
note
what
price
be
bid
for
them

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Hunsden
have
take
his
tone
for
the
night
;
the
string
he
strike
be
out
of
tune
,
he
would
finger
no
other
.
<EOS>
averse
to
discord
,
of
which
I
have
enough
every
day
and
all
day
long
<EOS>
,
I
conclude
,
at
last
,
that
silence
and
solitude
be
preferable
to
jar
converse
;
I
bid
him
good
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
be
you
go
,
lad
?
<EOS>
well
,
good
-
night
:
you
will
find
the
door
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
sit
still
in
front
of
the
fire
,
while
I
leave
the
room
and
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
have
get
a
good
way
on
my
return
to
my
lodging
before
I
find
out
that
I
be
walk
very
fast
,
and
breathe
very
hard
,
and
that
my
nail
be
almost
stick
into
the
palm
of
my
clenched
hand
,
and
that
my
tooth
be
set
fast
;
on
make
this
discovery
,
I
relax
both
my
pace
,
fist
,
and
jaw
,
but
I
could
not
so
soon
cause
the
regret
rush
rapidly
through
my
mind
to
slacken
their
tide
.
<EOS>
why
do
I
make
myself
a
tradesman
?
<EOS>
why
do
I
enter
Hunsden
's
house
this
evening
?
<EOS>
why
,
at
dawn
to
-
morrow
,
must
I
repair
to
Crimsworth
's
mill
?
<EOS>
all
that
night
do
I
ask
myself
these
question
,
and
all
that
night
fiercely
demand
of
my
soul
an
answer
.
<EOS>
I
get
no
sleep
<EOS>
;
my
head
burn
,
my
foot
freeze
;
at
last
the
factory
bell
rang
,
and
I
spring
from
my
bed
with
other
slave
.
    
<EOS>
there
be
a
climax
to
everything
,
to
every
state
of
feeling
as
well
as
to
every
position
in
life
.
<EOS>
I
turn
this
truism
over
in
my
mind
as
,
in
the
frosty
dawn
of
a
January
morning
,
I
hurry
down
the
steep
and
now
icy
street
which
descend
from
Mrs.
King
's
to
the
Close
.
<EOS>
the
factory
workpeople
have
precede
me
by
nearly
an
hour
,
and
the
mill
be
all
light
up
and
in
full
operation
when
I
reach
it
.
<EOS>
I
repair
to
my
post
in
the
counting
-
house
as
usual
;
the
fire
there
,
but
just
light
,
as
yet
only
smoke
;
Steighton
have
not
yet
arrive
.
<EOS>
I
shut
the
door
and
sit
down
at
the
desk
;
my
hand
,
recently
wash
in
half
-
frozen
water
,
be
still
numb
;
I
could
not
write
till
they
have
regain
vitality
,
so
I
go
on
thinking
,
and
still
the
theme
of
my
thought
be
the
"
climax
.
"
<EOS>
self
-
dissatisfaction
trouble
exceedingly
the
current
of
my
meditation
.
  
<EOS>
"
come

William

say
my
conscience
,
or
whatever
it
be
that
within
ourselves
take
ourselves
to
task
 
"
come
,
get
a
clear
notion
of
what
you
would
have
,
or
what
you
would
not

<EOS>
You
talk
of
a
climax
;
pray
have
your
endurance
reach
its
climax
?
<EOS>
It
be
not
four
month
old

<EOS>
what
a
fine
resolute
fellow
you
imagine
yourself
to

you
tell

defy

your

be
unequal

not
assimilate

never
hope

to
gather

out

<EOS>
hello

<EOS>
where
be
your

<EOS>
You
leave
the
recollection
of

as
a
bee
would
a
rock

as
a
bird
a

and
your
aspiration
spread
eager
wing
towards
a
land
of
vision
where
,
now
in
advance
daylight
 
in

daylight
 
<EOS>
you
dare
to
dream
of
congeniality

never

<EOS>
eight
o'clock

"

work

<EOS>
"
I
may

it

I
growl
;
but
nevertheless
I
draw
out
a
packet
of
letter
and
commence
my
task
 
task
thankless
and
bitter
as
that
of

israelite
crawling
over
the
sun
-
bake
field
of
Egypt
in
search
of
straw
and
stubble
wherewith

accomplish
his

about
ten
o'clock
<EOS>
I
hear
Mr.

gig
turn
into
the
yard
,
and
in
a
minute
or
two
he
enter
the
counting

house

<EOS>
It
be
his
custom
to
glance
his
eye
at
Steighton
and
myself
,
to
hang
up
his
mackintosh
,
stand
a
minute
with
his
back
to
the
fire
,
and
then
walk
out
.
<EOS>
today
he
do
not
deviate
from
his
usual
habit
;
the
only
difference
be
that
when
he
look
at
me
,
his
brow
,
instead
of
be
merely
hard
,
be
surly
;
his
eye
,
instead
of
be
cold
,
be
fierce
.
<EOS>
He
study
me
a
minute
or
two
long
than
usual
,
but
go
out
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
twelve
o'clock
arrive
;
the
bell
ring
for
a
suspension
of
labour

the
workpeople
go
off
to

Steighton
,
too
,
depart
,
desire
me
to
lock
the
counting

house
door

and
take
the
key
with
me

<EOS>
I
be
tie
up
a
bundle
of
paper
,
and
put
them
in
their
place
,
preparatory
to
close
my
desk
,
when
Crimsworth
reappear
at
the
door

and
enter
close
it
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
stay
here
a
minute

say
he
,
in
a
deep
,
brutal
voice
,
while
his
nostril
distend
and
his
eye
shoot
a
spark
of
sinister
fire
.
  
<EOS>
alone
with
Edward
<EOS>
I
remember
our
relationship
,
and
remember
that
forget
the
difference
of
position
;
I
put
away
deference
and
careful
form
of
speech
;
I
answer
with
simple
brevity
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be

the

by
allusion

detect

abate
something

insolence

he
have
no

I

after
an
odd

long
stare

at

amazed

he
seem
to
bethink
himself
that

after
all

his
money
give
him
sufficient
superiority
over
a
beggar
like
me

and
that
he
have
in
his
hand
a
sure

more
dignified
mode
of
revenge
than
the
somewhat
hazardous
one
of
personal
chastisement

"
take

return

<EOS>
I
leave

I
leave

I
leave

<EOS>
"
look
sharp
about

I
take
down
my

draw
on
my
glove
,
and
walk
leisurely
out
of
the
counting

house
 
walk
out
of
it

enter
it
no

<EOS>
I
recollect
that
when
the
mill

bell
ring
the
dinner
hour
,
before
Mr.
Crimsworth
enter
,
and
the
scene
above
relate
take
place
,
I
have
have
rather
a
sharp
appetite
,
and
have
be
wait
somewhat
impatiently
to
hear
the
signal
of
feed
time
.
<EOS>
I
forget
it
now
,
however
;
the
image
of
potato
and
roast
mutton
be
efface
from
my
mind
by
the
stir
and
tumult
<EOS>
which
the
transaction
of
the
last
half
-
hour
have
there
excite
.
<EOS>
I
only
think
of
walk
,
that
the
action
of
my
muscle
may
harmonize
with
the
action
of
my
nerve
;
and
walk
<EOS>
I
do
,
fast
and
far
.
<EOS>
how
could
I
do
otherwise
?
<EOS>
a
load
be
lift
off
my
heart
;
I
feel
light
and
liberate
.
<EOS>
I
have
get
away
from
Bigben
Close
without
a
breach
of
resolution
;
without
injury
to
my
self

<EOS>
I

again
open
to
me
;
no

be
its

by
the
high
black
wall
surround
Crimsworth

mill

<EOS>
two
hour
have
elapse
before
my
sensation
have
so
far
subside
as
to
leave
me
calm
enough
to
remark
for
what
wide
and
clear
boundary
<EOS>
I
have
exchange
that
sooty
girdle
.
<EOS>
when
I
do
look
up
,
lo

<EOS>
straight
before
me
lie
Grovetown
,
a
village
of
villas
about
five
mile
out
of

<EOS>
the
short
winter
day
,
as
I
perceive
from
the
far
-
declined
sun
,
be
already
approach
its
close
;
a
chill
frost
-
mist
be
rise
from
the
river
on
which
x
stand
,
and
along
whose
bank
the
road
I
have
take
lie
;
it
dim
the
earth
,
but
do
not
obscure
the
clear
icy
blue
of
the
January
sky
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
stillness
near
and
far
;
the
time
of
the
day
favour
tranquillity
,
as
the
people

all

the
hour

for
the
river

deep
and
abundant
,
swell
by
the
melting
of

late
snow

<EOS>
I
stand
awhile
,
lean
over
a
wall
;
and
look
down
at
the
current
:
I
watch
the
rapid
rush
of
its
wave
.
<EOS>
I
desire
memory
to
take
a
clear
and
permanent
impression
of
the
scene
,
and
treasure
it
for
future
year
.
<EOS>
grovetown
church
clock
strike
four
;
look
up
,
I
beheld
the
last
of
that
day
's
sun
,
glint
red
through
the
leafless
bough
of
some
very
old
oak
tree
surround
the
church
 
its
light
colour
and
characterize
the
picture
as
I
wish
.
<EOS>
I
pause
yet
a
moment
,
till
the
sweet
,
slow
sound
of
the
bell
have
quite
die
out
of
the
air
;
then
ear
,
eye
and
feel
satisfied
,
I
quit
the
wall
and
once
more
turn
my
face
towards
X
 
.
    
<EOS>
I
RE
-
entered
the
town
a
hungry
man
;
the
dinner
I
have
forget
recur
seductively
to
my
recollection
;
and
it
be
with
a
quick
step
and
sharp
appetite
<EOS>
I
ascend
the
narrow
street
lead
to
my
lodging
.
<EOS>
It
be
dark
when
I
open
the
front
door
and
walk
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
my
fire
would
be
;
the
night
be
cold
,
and
I
shudder
at
the
prospect
of
a
grate
full
of
sparkless
cinder
.
<EOS>
to
my
joyful
surprise
,
I
find
,
on
enter
my
sitting
-
room
,
a
good
fire
and
a
clean
hearth
.
<EOS>
I
have
hardly
notice
this
phenomenon
,
when
I
become
aware
of
another
subject
for
wonderment
;
the
chair
I
usually
occupy
near
the
hearth
be
already
fill
;
a
person
sit
there
with
his
arm
fold
on
his
chest
,
and
his
leg
stretch
out
on
the
rug
.
<EOS>
short
-
sight
as
I
be
,
doubtful
as
be
the
gleam
of
the
firelight
,
a
moment
's
examination
enable
me
to
recognize
in
this
person
my
acquaintance
,
Mr.
Hunsden
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
of
course
be
much
pleased
to
see
him
,
consider
the
manner
in
which
I
have
part
from
him
the
night
before
,
and
as
I
walk
to
the
hearth
,
stir
the
fire
,
and
say
coolly
,
"
good
evening
,
"
my
demeanour
evince
as
little
cordiality
as
I
feel
;
yet
I
wonder
in
my
own
mind
what
have
bring
him
there
;
and
I
wonder
,
also
,
what
motive
have
induce
him
to
interfere
so
actively
between
me
and
Edward
;
it
be
to
him
,
it
appear
,
that
I
owe
my
welcome
dismissal
;
still
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
ask
him
question
,
to
show
any
eagerness
of
curiosity
;
if
he
choose
to
explain
,
he
may
,
but
the
explanation
should
be
a
perfectly
voluntary
one
on
his
part
;
I
think
he
be
enter
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
owe
me
a
debt
of
gratitude
,
"
be
his
first
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
I
?
"
<EOS>
say
I
<EOS>
;
"
I
hope
it
be
not
a
large
one
,
for
I
be
much
too
poor
to
charge
myself
with
heavy
liability
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
declare
yourself
bankrupt
at
once
,
for
this
liability
be
a
ton
weight
at
least
.
<EOS>
when
I
come
in
I
find
your
fire
out
,
and
I
have
it
light
again
,
and
make
that
sulky
drab
of
a
servant
stay
and
blow
at
it
with
the
bellow
till
it
have
burn
up
properly
;
now
,
say
"
thank
you
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
not
till
I
have
have
something
to
eat
;
I
can
thank
nobody
while
I
be
so
famished
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
ring
the
bell
and
order
tea
and
some
cold
meat
.
  
<EOS>
"
cold
meat
!

exclaim
Hunsden
,
as
the
servant
close
the
door
,
"

a

<EOS>
"
no

Mr.
Hunsden

I

I
feel
a
necessity
for

him

I
be
irritated
with
hunger
,
and
irritate
at
see
him
there
,
and
irritate
at
the
continue
roughness
of
his
manner

It

<EOS>
"
how

It
be

petulant

snappish

reply
by
look
in

fortunately
at

sulky
juncture

in

I
fall
to
upon
some
bread

butter

cold
beef
directly

anything
sweet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
call
you
a
treacherous
villain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
he
hardly
know
me
yet
!
<EOS>
I
be
one
of
those
shy
people
who
do
not
come
out
all
at
once
,
and
he
be
only
just
begin
to
make
my
acquaintance
,
but
he
will
find
I
have
some
good
quality
 
excellent
one
!
<EOS>
the
Hunsdens
be
always
unrivalled
at
track
a
rascal
;
a
downright
,
dishonourable
villain
be
their
natural
prey
 
<EOS>
they
could
not
keep
off
him
wherever
they
meet
him
;
you
use
the
word
pragmatical
just
now
 
<EOS>
that
word
be
the
property
of
our
family
;
it
have
be
apply
to
us
from
generation
to
generation
;
we
have
fine
nose
for
abuse
;
we
scent
a
scoundrel
a
mile
off
;
we
be
reformer
bear
,
radical
reformer
;
and
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
live
in
the
same
town
with
Crimsworth
,
to
come
into
weekly
contact
with
him
,
to
witness
some
of
his
conduct
to
you
(
for
whom
personally
I
care
nothing
;
I
only
consider
the
brutal
injustice
with
which
he
violate
your
natural
claim
to
equality
)
 
<EOS>
I
say
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
be
thus
situate
and
not
feel
the
angel
or
the
demon
of
my
race
at
work
within
me
.
<EOS>
I
follow
my
instinct
,
oppose
a
tyrant
,
and
break
a
chain
.
"
  
<EOS>
now
this
speech
interest
me
much
,
both
because
it
bring
out
Hunsden
's
character
,
and
because
it
explain
his
motive
;
it
interest
me
so
much
that
I
forgot
to
reply
to
it
,
and
sit
silent
,
ponder
over
a
throng
of
idea
it
have
suggest
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
grateful
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
,
presently
.
  
<EOS>
in
fact
I
be
grateful
,
or
almost
so
,
and
I
believe
I
half
like
him
at
the
moment
,
notwithstanding
his
proviso
that
what
he
have
do
be
not
out
of
regard
for
me
.
<EOS>
but
human
nature
be
perverse
.
<EOS>
impossible
to
answer
his
blunt
question
in
the
affirmative
,
so
I
disclaim
all
tendency
to
gratitude
,
and
advise
him
if
he
expect
any
reward
for
his
championship
,
to
look
for
it
in
a
well
world
,
as
he
be
not
likely
to
meet
with
it
here
.
<EOS>
in
reply
he
term
me
"
a
dry
-
hearted
aristocratic
scamp
,
"
whereupon
I
again
charge
him
with
have
take
the
bread
out
of
my
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
bread
be
dirty
,
man
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Hunsden
 
<EOS>
"
dirty
and
unwholesome
!
<EOS>
It
come
through
the
hand
of
a
tyrant
,
for
I
tell
you
Crimsworth
be
a
tyrant
,
 
a
tyrant
to
his
workpeople
,
a
tyrant
to
his
clerk
,
and
will
some
day
be
a
tyrant
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
nonsense
!
<EOS>
bread
be
bread
,
and
a
salary
be
a
salary
.
<EOS>
I
have
lose
mine
,
and
through
your
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
sense
in
what
you
say
,
after
all
,
"
rejoin
Hunsden
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
say
I
be
rather
agreeably
surprised
to
hear
you
make
so
practical
an
observation
as
that
last
.
<EOS>
I
have
imagine
now
,
from
my
previous
observation
of
your
character
,
that
the
sentimental
delight
you
would
have
take
in
your
newly
regain
liberty
would
,
for
a
while
at
least
,
have
efface
all
idea
of
forethought
and
prudence
.
<EOS>
I
think
better
of
you
for
look
steadily
to
the
needful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
look
steadily
to
the
needful
!
<EOS>
how
can
I
do
otherwise
?
<EOS>
I
must
live
,
and
to
live
<EOS>
I
must
have
what
you
call
"
the
needful
,
"
which
I
can
only
get
by
work
.
<EOS>
I
repeat
it
,
you
have
take
my
work
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
mean
to
do
?
"
pursue
Hunsden
coolly
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
influential
relation
;
I
suppose
they
will
soon
provide
you
with
another
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
influential
relation
?
<EOS>
who
?
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
know
their
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
Seacombes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
stuff
!
<EOS>
I
have
cut
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hunsden
look
at
me
incredulously
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
"
say
I
,
"
and
that
definitively
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
mean
they
have
cut
you
,
William
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
They
offer
me
their
patronage
on
condition
of
my
enter
the
Church
;
I
decline
both
the
term
and
the
recompence
;
I
withdraw
from
my
cold
uncle
,
and
preferred
throw
myself
into
my
eld
brother
's
arm
,
from
whose
affectionate
embrace
I
be
now
tear
by
the
cruel
intermeddling
of
a
stranger
 
of
yourself
,
in
short
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
repress
a
half
-
smile
as
I
say
this
;
a
similar
demi
-
manifestation
of
feeling
appear
at
the
same
moment
on
Hunsden
's
lip
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
I
see
!
"
<EOS>
say
he
,
look
into
my
eye
,
and
it
be
evident
he
do
see
right
down
into
my
heart
.
<EOS>
have
sit
a
minute
or
two
with
his
chin
rest
on
his
hand
,
diligently
occupy
in
the
continue
perusal
of
my
countenance
,
he
go
on
:
  
"
<EOS>
seriously
,
have
you
then
nothing
to
expect
from
the
Seacombes
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
rejection
and
repulsion
.
<EOS>
why
do
you
ask
me
twice
?
<EOS>
how
can
hand
stain
with
the
ink
of
a
counting
-
house
,
soil
with
the
grease
of
a
wool
-
warehouse
,
ever
again
be
permit
to
come
into
contact
with
aristocratic
palm
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
there
would
be
a
difficulty
,
no
doubt
;
still
you
be
such
a
complete
Seacombe
in
appearance
,
feature
,
language
,
almost
manner
,
I
wonder
they
should
disown
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
disown
me
;
so
talk
no
more
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
regret
it
,
William
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
not
,
lad
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
because
they
be
not
people
with
whom
I
could
ever
have
have
any
sympathy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
you
be
one
of
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
merely
prove
that
you
know
nothing
at
all
about
it
;
I
be
my
mother
's
son
,
but
not
my
uncle
'
nephew
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
still
 
one
of
your
uncle
be
a
lord
,
though
rather
an
obscure
and
not
a
very
wealthy
one
,
and
the
other
<EOS>
a
right
honourable
<EOS>
:
you
should
consider
worldly
interest
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nonsense
,
Mr.
Hunsden
.
<EOS>
You
know
or
may
know
that
even
have
I
desire
to
be
submissive
to
my
uncle
,
I
could
not
have
stoop
with
a
good
enough
grace
ever
to
have
win
their
favour
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
sacrifice
my
own
comfort
and
not
have
gain
their
patronage
in
return
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
very
likely
 
so
you
calculate
your
wise
plan
be
to
follow
your
own
device
at
once
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
exactly
.
<EOS>
I
must
follow
my
own
device
 
<EOS>
I
must
,
till
the
day
of
my
death
;
because
I
can
neither
comprehend
,
adopt
,
nor
work
out
those
of
other
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hunsden
yawn
.
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
in
all
this
,
I
see
but
one
thing
clearly
-
that
is
,
that
the
whole
affair
be
no
business
of
mine
.
"
<EOS>
He
stretch
himself
and
again
yawn
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
time
it
be

"
he
go
on
:
"
I
have
an
appointment
for
seven
o'clock

"
  
<EOS>
"
three
quarter
past
six
by
my
watch

I
will
go

He
get
up

<EOS>
"
You
will
not
meddle
with
trade
again

he

lean
his
elbow
on
the
mantelpiece

<EOS>
"
no
;
I
think
not

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
be
a
fool
if
you
do
.
<EOS>
probably
,
after
all
,
you
will
think
better
of
your
uncle
'
proposal
and
go
into
the
Church
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
singular
regeneration
must
take
place
in
my
whole
inner

outer
man
before
I
do
that

<EOS>
a
good
clergyman
be
one
of
the
good
of
man

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
indeed
!
<EOS>
do
you
think
so
?
"
<EOS>
interrupt
Hunsden
,
scoffingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
and
no
mistake
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
not
the
peculiar
point
which
go
to
make
a
good
clergyman
;
and
rather
than
adopt
a
profession
for
which
I
have
no
vocation
,
I
would
endure
extremity
of
hardship
from
poverty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
mighty
difficult
customer
to
suit
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
be
a
tradesman
or
a
parson
;
you
can
not
be
a
lawyer
,
or
a
doctor
,
or
a
gentleman
,
because
you
have
no
money
.
<EOS>
I
would
recommend
you
to
travel

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what

without
money

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

You

You
can
speak
French

no

you

Mr.

that

Farewell

<EOS>
this

Belgium

reader

<EOS>
look
!
<EOS>
do
not
call
the
picture
a
flat
or
a
dull
one
 
<EOS>
it
be
neither
flat
nor
dull
to
me
when
I
first
beheld
it
.
<EOS>
when
I
leave
Ostend
on
a
mild
February
morning
,
and
find
myself
on
the
road
to
Brussels
,
nothing
could
look
vapid
to
me
.
<EOS>
My
sense
of
enjoyment
possess
an
edge
whet
to
the
fine
,
untouched
,
keen
,
exquisite
.
<EOS>
I
be
young
;
I
have
good
health
;
pleasure
and
I
have
never
meet
;
no
indulgence
of
her
have
enervate
or
sate
one
faculty
of
my
nature
.
<EOS>
liberty
I
clasp
in
my
arm
for
the
first
time
,
and
the
influence
of
her
smile
and
embrace
revive
my
life
like
the
sun
and
the
west
wind
.
<EOS>
yes
,
at
that
epoch
I
feel
like
a
morning
traveller
who
doubt
not
that
from
the
hill
he
be
ascend
he
shall
behold
a
glorious
sunrise
;
what
if
the
track
be
strait
,
steep
,
and
stony
?
<EOS>
he
see
it
not
;
his
eye
be
fix
on
that
summit
,
flush
already
,
flush
and
gild
,
and
have
gain
it
<EOS>
he
be
certain
of
the
scene
beyond
.
<EOS>
He
know
that
the
sun
will
face
him
,
that
his
chariot
be
even
now
come
over
the
eastern
horizon
,
and
that
the
herald
breeze
he
feel
on
his
cheek
be
open
for
the
god
's
career
a
clear
,
vast
path
of
azure
,
amidst
cloud
soft
as
pearl
and
warm
as
flame
.
<EOS>
difficulty
and
toil
be
to
be
my
lot
,
but
sustain
by
energy
,
draw
on
by
hope
as
bright
as
vague
<EOS>
,
I
deem
such
a
lot
no
hardship
.
<EOS>
I
mount
now
the
hill
in
shade
;
there
be
pebble
,
inequality
,
briar
in
my
path
,
but
my
eye
be
fix
on
the
crimson
peak
above
;
my
imagination
be
with
the
refulgent
firmament
beyond
,
and
I
think
nothing
of
the
stone
turn
under
my
foot
,
or
of
the
thorn
scratch
my
face
and
hand
.
  
<EOS>
I
gaze
often
,
and
always
with
delight
,
from
the
window
of
the
diligence
(
these
,
be
it
remember
,
be
not
the
day
of
train
and
railroad
)
.
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
and
what
do
I
see
?
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
faithfully
.
<EOS>
green
,
reedy
swamp
;
field
fertile
but
flat
,
cultivate
in
patch
that
make
them
look
like
magnify

;
belt
of

not
<EOS>
a

scarcely

my

along
the
whole

yet
to
me
,
all
be
beautiful
,
all
be
more
than
picturesque
.
<EOS>
It
continue
fair
so
long
as
daylight
last
,
though
the
moisture
of
many
precede
damp
day
have
sodden
the
whole
country
;
as
it
grow
dark
,
however
,
the
rain
recommence
,
and
it
be
through
streaming
and
starless
darkness
<EOS>
my
eye
catch
the
first
gleam
of
the
light
of
Brussels
.
<EOS>
I
see
little
of
the
city
but
its
light
that
night
.
<EOS>
have
alight
from
the
diligence
,
a
fiacre
convey
me
to
the
Hotel
de

where
I
have
be
advise
by
a
fellow
-
traveller
to
put
up
;
have
eat
a
traveller
's
supper
,
I
retire
to
bed
,
and
sleep
a
traveller
's
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
next
morning
I
awake
from
prolonged
and
sound
repose
with
the
impression
that
I
be
yet
in
X
 
,
and
perceive
it
to
be
broad
daylight
I
start
up
,
imagine
that
I
have
oversleep
myself
and
should
be
behind
time
at
the
counting
-
house
.
<EOS>
the
momentary
and
painful
sense
of
restraint
vanish
before
the
revive
and
revive
consciousness
of
freedom
,
as
,
throw
back
the
white
curtain
of
my
bed
<EOS>
,
I
look
forth
into
a
wide
,
lofty
foreign
chamber
;
how
different
from
the
small
and
dingy
,
though
not
uncomfortable
,
apartment
I
have
occupy
for
a
night
or
two
at
a
respectable
inn
in
London
while
wait
for
the
sailing
of
the
packet
!
<EOS>
yet
far
be
it
from
me
to
profane
the
memory
of
that
little
dingy
room
!
<EOS>
It
,
too
,
be
dear
to
my
soul
;
for
there
,
as
I
lay
in
quiet
and
darkness
,
I
first
hear
the
great
bell
of
<EOS>
St.
Paul
's
tell
London
<EOS>
it
be
midnight
,
and
well
do
I
recall
the
deep
,
deliberate
tone
,
<EOS>
so
full
charge
with
colossal
phlegm
and
force
.
<EOS>
from
the
small
,
narrow
window
of
that
room
,
I
first
see
the
dome
,
loom
through
a
London
mist
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
sensation
,
stir
by
those
first
sound
,
first
sight
,
be
feel
but
once
;
treasure
them
,
memory
;
seal
them
in
urn
,
and
keep
them
in
safe
niche
!
<EOS>
well
 
I
rise
.
<EOS>
traveller
talk
of
the
apartment
in
foreign
dwelling
be
bare
and
uncomfortable
;
I
think
my
chamber
look
stately
and
cheerful
.
<EOS>
It
have
such
large
window
 
croisee
that
open
like
door
,
with
such
broad
,
clear
pane
of
glass
;
such
a
great
looking
-
glass
stand
on
my
dressing
-
table
 
such
a
fine
mirror
glitter
over
the
mantelpiece
 
the
paint
floor
look
so
clean
and
glossy
;
when
I
have
dress
and
be
descend
the
stair
,
the
broad
marble
step
almost
awe
me
,
and
so
do
the
lofty
hall
into
which
they
conduct
.
<EOS>
on
the
first
landing
I
meet
a
flemish
housemaid
:
she
have
wooden
shoe
,
a
short
red
petticoat
,
a
print
cotton
bedgown
<EOS>
,
her
face
be
broad
,
her
physiognomy
eminently
stupid
;
when
I
speak
to
her
in
French
,
she
answer
me
in
Flemish
,
with
an
air
the
reverse
of
civil
;
yet
I
think
her
charming
;
if
she
be
not
pretty
or
polite
,
she
be
,
I
conceive
,
<EOS>
very
picturesque
<EOS>
;
she
remind
me
of
the
female
figure
in
certain
dutch
painting
I
have
see
in
other
year
at
Seacombe
Hall
.
  
<EOS>
I
repair
to
the
public
room
;
that
,
too
,
be
very
large
and
very
lofty
,
and
warm
by
a
stove
;
the
floor
be
black
,
and
the
stove
be
black
,
and
most
of
the
furniture
be
black
:
yet
I
never
experience
a
free
sense
of
exhilaration
than
when
I
sit
down
at
a
very
long
,
black
table
(
cover
,
however
,
in
part
by
a
white
cloth
)
,
and
,
have
order
breakfast
,
begin
to
pour
out
my
coffee
from
a
little
black
coffee
-
pot
.
<EOS>
the
stove
may
be
dismal
-
look
to
some
eye
,
not
to
mine
,
but
it
be
indisputably
very
warm
,
and
there
be
two
gentleman
seat
by
it
talk
in
French
;
impossible
to
follow
their
rapid
utterance
,
or
comprehend
much
of
the
purport
of
what
they
say
 
yet
French
,
in
the
mouth
of
frenchman
,
or
Belgians
(
I
be
not
then
sensible
of
the
horror
of
the
belgian
accent
)
be
as
music
to
my
ear
.
<EOS>
one
of
these
gentleman
presently
discern
me
to
be
an
Englishman
 
no
doubt
from
the
fashion
in
which
I
address
the
waiter
;
for
I
would
persist
in
speak
French
in
my
execrable
south
-
of
-
England
style
,
though
the
man
understand
English
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
,
after
look
towards
me
once
or
twice
,
politely
accost
me
in
very
good
English
;
I
remember
I
wish
to
God
that
I
could
speak
French
as
well
;
his
fluency
and
correct
pronunciation
impress
me
for
the
first
time
with
a
due
notion
of
the
cosmopolitan
character
of
the
capital
I
be
in
;
it
be
my
first
experience
of
that
skill
in
living
language
<EOS>
I
afterwards
find
to
be
so
general
in
Brussels
.
  
<EOS>
I
linger
over
my
breakfast
as
long
as
I
could
;
while
it
be
there
on
the
table
,
and
while
that
stranger
continue
talk
to
me
,
I
be
a
free
,
independent
traveller
;
but
at
last
the
thing
be
remove
,
the
two
gentleman
leave
the
room
;
suddenly
the
illusion
cease
,
reality
and
business
come
back
.
<EOS>
I
,
a
bondsman
just
release
from
the
yoke
,
free
for
one
week
from
twenty
-
one
year
of
constraint
,
must
,
of
necessity
,
resume
the
fetter
of
dependency
.
<EOS>
hardly
have
I
taste
the
delight
of
be
without
a
master
when
duty
issue
her
stern
mandate
:
"
go
forth
and
seek
another
service
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
linger
over
a
painful
and
necessary
task
;
I
never
take
pleasure
before
business
,
it
be
not
in
my
nature
to
do
so
;
impossible
to
enjoy
a
leisurely
walk
over
the
city
,
though
I
perceive
the
morning
be
very
fine
,
until
I
have
first
present
Mr.
Hunsden
's
letter
of
introduction
,
and
get
fairly
on
to
the
track
of
a
new
situation
.
<EOS>
wrench
my
mind
from
liberty
and
delight
,
I
seize
my
hat
,
and
force
my
reluctant
body
out
of
the
Hotel
de
 
into
the
foreign
street
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
day
,
but
I
would
not
look
at
the
blue
sky
or
at
the
stately
house
round
me
;
my
mind
be
bent
on
one
thing
,
find
out
"
Mr.
Brown
,
Numero
,
Rue
Royale
,
"
for
so
my
letter
be
address
.
<EOS>
by
dint
of
inquiry
I
succeed
;
I
stand
at
last
at
the
desire
door
,
knock
,
ask
for
Mr.
Brown
,
and
be
admit
.
  
<EOS>
be
show
into
a
small
breakfast
-
room
,
I
find
myself
in
the
presence
of
an
elderly
gentleman
 
very
grave
,
business
-
like
,
and
respectable
-
looking
.
<EOS>
I
present
Mr.
Hunsden
's
letter
;
he
receive
me
very
civilly
.
<EOS>
after
a
little
desultory
conversation
he
ask
me
if
there
be
anything
in
which
his
advice
or
experience
could
be
of
use
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
"
yes
,
"
and
then
proceed
to
tell
him
that
I
be
not
a
gentleman
of
fortune
,
travel
for
pleasure
,
but
an
ex
-
count
-
house
clerk
,
who
want
employment
of
some
kind
,
and
that
immediately
too
.
<EOS>
He
reply
that
as
a
friend
of
Mr.
Hunsden
's
he
would
be
willing
to
assist
me
as
well
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
after
some
meditation
he
name
a
place
in
a
mercantile
house
at
Liege
,
and
another
in
a
bookseller
's
shop
at
Louvain
.
  
<EOS>
"
clerk
and
shopman
!
"
<EOS>
murmur
I
to
myself
.
"
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
"
I
shake
my
head
.
<EOS>
I
have
try
the
high
stool
;
I
hate
it
;
I
believe
there
be
other
occupation
that
would
suit
me
better
;
besides
I
do
not
wish
to
leave
Brussels
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
of
no
place
in
Brussels
,
"
answer
Mr.
Brown
,
"
unless
indeed
you
be
dispose
to
turn
your
attention
to
teaching
.
<EOS>
I
be
acquaint
with
the
director
of
a
large
establishment
who
be
in
want
of
a
professor
of
English
and
Latin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
two
minute
,
then
I
seize
the
idea
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
very
thing
,
sir
!
"
say
I.
  
"
<EOS>
but
,
"
ask
he
,
"
do
you
understand
French
well
enough
to
teach
belgian
boy
english
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
fortunately
I
could
answer
this
question
in
the
affirmative
;
have
study
French
under
a
Frenchman
,
I
could
speak
the
language
intelligibly
though
not
fluently
.
<EOS>
I
could
also
read
it
well
,
and
write
it
decently
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
,
"
pursue
Mr.
Brown
,
"
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
promise
you
the
place
,
for
Monsieur
Pelet
will
not
refuse
a
professor
recommend
by
me
;
but
come
here
again
at
five
o'clock
this
afternoon
,
and
I
will
introduce
you
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
word
"
professor
"
strike
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
a
professor
,
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
"
return
Mr.
Brown
,
"
professor
,
here
in
Belgium
,
mean
a
teacher
,
that
be
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
conscience
thus
quiet
,
I
thank
Mr.
Brown
,
and
,
for
the
present
,
withdraw
.
<EOS>
this
time
I
step
out
into
the
street
with
a
relieved
heart
;
the
task
I
have
impose
on
myself
for
that
day
be
execute
.
<EOS>
I
may
now
take
some
hour
of
holiday
.
<EOS>
I
feel
free
to
look
up
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
I
remark
the
sparkle
clearness
of
the
air
,
the
deep
blue
of
the
sky
,
the
gay
clean
aspect
of
the
white
-
washed
or
paint
house
;
I
see
what
a
fine
street
be
the
Rue
Royale
,
and
,
walk
leisurely
along
its
broad
pavement
,
I
continue
to
survey
its
stately
hotel
,
till
the
palisade
,
the
gate
,
and
tree
of
the
park
appear
in
sight
,
offer
to
my
eye
a
new
attraction
.
<EOS>
I
remember
,
before
enter
the
park
,
I
stand
awhile
to
contemplate
the
statue
of
General
Belliard
,
and
then
I
advance
to
the
top
of
the
great
staircase
just
beyond
,
and
I
look
down
into
a
narrow
back
street
,
which
I
afterwards
learnt
be
call
the
Rue
d'Isabelle
.
<EOS>
I
well
recollect
that
my
eye
rest
on
the
green
door
of
a
rather
large
house
opposite
,
where
,
on
a
brass
plate
,
be
inscribe
,
"
Pensionnat
de
Demoiselles
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
pensionnat
!
<EOS>
the
word
excite
an
uneasy
sensation
in
my
mind
;
it
seem
to
speak
of
restraint
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
demoiselle
,
externat
no
doubt
,
be
at
that
moment
issue
from
the
door
 
<EOS>
I
look
for
a
pretty
face
amongst
them
,
but
their
close
,
little
french
bonnet
hide
their
feature
;
in
a
moment
they
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
traverse
a
good
deal
of
Brussels
before
five
o'clock
arrive
,
but
punctually
as
that
hour
strike
I
be
again
in
the
Rue
Royale
.
<EOS>
Re
-
admit
to
Mr.
Brown
's
breakfast
-
room
,
I
find
him
,
as
before
,
seat
at
the
table
,
and
he
be
not
alone
 
<EOS>
a
gentleman
stand
by
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
two
word
of
introduction
designate
him
as
my
future
master

"
<EOS>
M.
Pelet
,
Mr.
Crimsworth
;
Mr.
Crimsworth
,
M.
Pelet
,
"
a
bow
on
each
side
finish
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
sort
of
a
bow
I
make
;
an
ordinary
one
,
I
suppose
,
for
I
be
in
a
tranquil
,
commonplace
frame
of
mind
;
I
feel
none
of
the
agitation
which
have
trouble
my
first
interview
with
Edward
Crimsworth
.
<EOS>
M.
Pelet
's
bow
be
extremely
polite
,
yet
not
theatrical
,
scarcely
French
;
he
and
I
be
presently
seat
opposite
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
in
a
pleasing
voice
,
low
,
and
,
out
of
consideration
to
my
foreign
ear
,
very
distinct
and
deliberate
,
M.
Pelet
intimate
that
he
have
just
be
receive
from
"
le
respectable
M.
Brown
,
"
an
account
of
my
attainment
and
character
,
which
relieve
him
from
all
scruple
as
to
the
propriety
of
engage
me
as
professor
of
English
and
Latin
in
his
establishment
;
nevertheless
,
for
form
's
sake
,
he
would
put
a
few
question
to
test
my
power
.
<EOS>
He
do
,
and
express
in
flattering
term
his
satisfaction
at
my
answer
.
<EOS>
the
subject
of
salary
next
come
on
;
it
be
fix
at
one
thousand
franc
per
annum
,
besides
board
and
lodging
.
"
<EOS>
and
in
addition
,
"
suggest
M.
Pelet
,
"
as
there
will
be
some
hour
in
each
day
during
which
your
service
will
not
be
require
in
my
establishment
,
<EOS>
you
may
,
in
time
,
obtain
employment
in
other
seminary
,
and
thus
turn
your
vacant
moment
to
profitable
account
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
this
very
kind
,
and
indeed
I
find
afterwards
that
the
term
on
which
M.
Pelet
have
engage
me
be
really
liberal
for
Brussels
;
instruction
be
extremely
cheap
there
on
account
of
the
number
of
teacher
.
<EOS>
It
be
further
arrange
that
I
should
be
instal
in
my
new
post
the
very
next
day
,
after
which
M.
Pelet
and
I
part
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
and
what
be
he
like
?
<EOS>
and
what
be
my
impression
concern
him
?
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
of
about
forty
year
of
age
,
of
middle
size
,
and
rather
emaciate
figure
;
his
face
be
pale
,
his
cheek
be
sink
,
and
his
eye
hollow
;
his
feature
be
pleasing
and
regular
,
they
have
a
french
turn
(
for
M.
Pelet
be
no
Fleming
,
but
<EOS>
a
Frenchman
both
by
birth
and
parentage
)
,
yet
the
degree
of
harshness
inseparable
from
Gallic
lineament
be
,
in
his
case
,
soften
by
a
mild
blue
eye
,
and
a
melancholy
,
almost
suffer
,
expression
of
countenance
;
his
physiognomy
be
"
fine
et
spirituelle
.
<EOS>
"
I
use
two
french
word
because
they
define
better
than
any
english
term
the
specie
of
intelligence
with
which
his
feature
be
imbue
.
<EOS>
He
be
altogether
an
interesting
and
prepossessing
personage
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
only
at
the
utter
absence
of
all
the
ordinary
characteristic
of
his
profession
,
and
almost
fear
he
could
not
be
stern
and
resolute
enough
for
a
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
externally
at
least
M.
Pelet
present
an
absolute
contrast
to
my
late
master
,
Edward
Crimsworth
.
  
<EOS>
influence
by
the
impression
I
have
receive
of
his
gentleness
,
I
be
a
good
deal
surprise
when
,
on
arrive
the
next
day
at
my
new
employer
's
house
,
and
be
admit
to
a
first
view
of
what
be
to
be
the
sphere
of
my
future
labour
,
namely
the
large
,
lofty
,
and
well
-
light
schoolroom
,
I
beheld
a
numerous
assemblage
of
pupil
,
boy
of
course
,
whose
collective
appearance
show
all
the
sign
of
a
full
,
flourish
,
and
well
-
discipline
seminary
.
<EOS>
as
I
traverse
the
class
in
company
with
M.
Pelet
,
a
profound
silence
reign
on
all
side
,
and
if
by
chance
a
murmur
or
a
whisper
arise
,
one
glance
from
the
pensive
eye
of
this
most
gentle
pedagogue
still
it
instantly
.
<EOS>
It
be
astonishing
,
I
think
,
how
so
mild
a
check
could
prove
so
effectual
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
perambulate
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
class
,
M.
Pelet
turn
and
say
to
me
    
"
<EOS>
Would
you
object
to
take
the
boy
as
they
be
,
and
test
their
proficiency
in
English
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
proposal
be
unexpected
.
<EOS>
I
have
think
I
should
have
be
allow
at
least
three
day
to
prepare
;
but
it
be
a
bad
oman
to
commence
any
career
by
hesitation
,
so
I
just
step
to
the
professor
's
desk
near
which
we
stand
,
and
face
the
circle
of
my
pupil
.
<EOS>
I
take
a
moment
to
collect
my
thought
,
and
likewise
to
frame
in
French
the
sentence
by
which
I
propose
to
open
business
.
<EOS>
I
make
it
as
short
as
possible
:
    
"
Messieurs
,
prenez
vos
livres
de
lecture
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Anglais
ou
Francais
,
monsieur
?
"
demand
a
thickset
,
moon
-
face
young
Flamand
in
a
blouse
.
<EOS>
the
answer
be
fortunately
easy
:
    
"
Anglais
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
determine
to
give
myself
as
little
trouble
as
possible
in
this
lesson
;
it
would
not
do
yet
to
trust
my
unpractised
tongue
with
the
delivery
of
explanation
;
my
accent
and
idiom
would
be
too
open
to
the
criticism
of
the
young
gentleman
before
me
,
relative
<EOS>
to
whom
I
feel
already
it
would
be
necessary
at
once
to
take
up
an
advantageous
position
,
and
I
proceed
to
employ
mean
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Commencez
!
"
<EOS>
cry
I
,
when
they
have
all
produce
their
book
.
<EOS>
the
moon
-
face
youth
(
by
name
Jules
Vanderkelkov
,
as
I
afterwards
learn
)
take
the
first
sentence
.
<EOS>
the
"
livre
de
lecture
"
be
the
"
Vicar
of
Wakefield
,
"
much
use
in
foreign
school
because
it
be
suppose
to
contain
prime
sample
of
conversational
English
;
it
may
,
however
,
have
be
a
runic
scroll
for
any
resemblance
<EOS>
the
word
,
as
enunciate
by
Jules
,
bear
to
the
language
in
ordinary
use
amongst
the
native
of
Great
Britain
.
<EOS>
My
God
!
<EOS>
how
he
do
snuffle
,
snort
,
and
wheeze
!
<EOS>
all
he
say
be
say
in
his
throat
and
nose
,
for
it
be
thus
the
Flamands
speak
,
but
I
hear
him
to
the
end
of
his
paragraph
without
proffer
a
word
of
correction
,
whereat
he
look
vastly
self
-
complacent
,
convinced
,
no
doubt
,
that
he
have
acquit
himself
like
a
real
bear
and
breed
"
Anglais
.
<EOS>
"
in
the
same
unmoved
silence
I
listen
to
a
dozen
in
rotation
,
and
when
the
twelfth
have
conclude
with
splutter
,
hiss
,
and
mumble
,
I
solemnly
lay
down
the
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
Arretez
!
<EOS>
"
say
I.
there
be
a
pause
,
during
which
I
regard
them
all
with
a
steady
and
somewhat
stern
gaze
;
a
dog
,
if
stare
at
hard
enough
and
long
enough
,
will
show
symptom
of
embarrassment
,
and
so
at
length
do
my
bench
of
Belgians
.
<EOS>
perceive
that
some
of
the
face
before
me
be
begin
to
look
sullen
,
and
other
ashamed
,
I
slowly
join
my
hand
,
and
ejaculate
in
a
deep
"
voix
de
poitrine
"
    
"
<EOS>
Comme
c'est
affreux
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
look
at
each
other
,
pout
,
coloured
,
swing
their
heel
;
they
be
not
pleased
,
I
see
,
but
they
be
impress
,
and
in
the
way
I
wish
them
to
be
.
<EOS>
have
thus
take
them
down
a
peg
in
their
self
-
conceit
,
the
next
step
be
to
raise
myself
in
their
estimation
;
not
a
very
easy
thing
,
consider
that
I
hardly
dare
to
speak
for
fear
of
betray
my
own
deficiency
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ecoutez
,
monsieur
!
"
say
I
,
and
I
endeavour
to
throw
into
my
accent
the
compassionate
tone
of
a
superior
being
,
who
,
touch
by
the
extremity
of
the
helplessness
,
which
at
first
only
excite
his
scorn
,
deign
at
length
to
bestow
aid
.
<EOS>
I
then
begin
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
"
Vicar
of
Wakefield
,
"
and
read
,
in
a
slow
,
distinct
voice
,
some
twenty
page
,
they
all
the
while
sit
mute
and
listen
with
fix
attention
;
by
the
time
I
have
do
nearly
an
hour
have
elapse
.
<EOS>
I
then
rise
and
say
:
    
"
C'est
assez
pour
aujourd'hui
,
monsieur
;
demain
nous
recommenceron
,
et
j'espere
que
tout
ira
bien
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
this
oracular
sentence
I
bow
,
and
in
company
with
M.
Pelet
quit
the
school
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
C'est
bien
!
<EOS>
c'
tre
bien
!
"
say
my
principal
as
we
enter
his
parlour
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
je
vois
que
monsieur
a
de
l'adresse
;
cela
,
me
plait
,
car
,
dans
l'instruction
,
l'adresse
fait
tout
autant
que
le
savoir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
from
the
parlour
M.
Pelet
conduct
me
to
my
apartment
,
my
"
chambre
,
"
as
Monsieur
say
with
a
certain
air
of
complacency
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
small
room
,
with
an
excessively
small
bed
,
but
M.
Pelet
give
me
to
understand
that
I
be
to
occupy
it
quite
alone
,
which
be
of
course
a
great
comfort
.
<EOS>
yet
,
though
so
limited
in
dimension
,
it
have
two
window
.
<EOS>
light
not
be
tax
in
Belgium
,
the
people
never
grudge
its
admission
into
their
house
;
just
here
,
however
,
this
observation
be
not
very
APROPOS
,
for
one
of
these
window
be
board
up
;
the
open
window
look
into
the
boy
'
playground
.
<EOS>
I
glance
at
the
other
,
as
wonder
what
aspect
it
would
present
if
disencumber
of
the
board
.
<EOS>
M.
Pelet
read
,
I
suppose
,
the
expression
of
my
eye
;
he
explain
:
    
"
La
fenetre
fermee
donne
<EOS>
sur
un
jardin
appartenant
a
un
pensionnat
de
demoiselles
,
"
say
he
,
"
et
<EOS>
les
convenance
exigent
 
enfin
<EOS>
,
vous
comprenez
 
<EOS>
n'est
-
ce
pas
,
monsieur
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oui
,
oui
<EOS>
,
"
be
my
reply
,
and
I
look
of
course
quite
satisfied
;
but
when
M.
Pelet
have
retire
and
close
the
door
after
him
,
the
first
thing
I
do
be
to
scrutinize
closely
the
nail
board
,
hope
to
find
some
chink
or
crevice
which
I
may
enlarge
,
and
so
get
a
peep
at
the
consecrated
ground
.
<EOS>
My
research
be
vain
,
for
the
board
be
well
joined
and
strongly
nailed
.
<EOS>
It
be
astonish
how
disappointed
I
feel
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
have
be
so
pleasant
to
have
look
out
upon
a
garden
plant
with
flower
and
tree
,
so
amusing
to
have
watch
the
demoiselle
at
their
play
;
to
have
study
female
character
in
a
variety
of
phase
,
myself
the
while
shelter
from
view
by
a
modest
muslin
curtain
,
whereas
,
owe
doubtless
to
the
absurd
scruple
of
some
old
duenna
of
a
directress
,
I
have
now
only
the
option
of
look
at
a
bare
gravel
court
,
with
an
enormous
"
pas
de
geant
"
in
the
middle
,
and
the
monotonous
wall
and
window
of
a
boy
'
school
-
house
round
.
<EOS>
not
only
then
,
but
many
a
time
after
,
especially
in
moment
of
weariness
and
low
spirit
,
do
I
look
with
dissatisfied
eye
on
that
most
tantalizing
board
,
long
to
tear
it
away
and
get
a
glimpse
of
the
green
region
which
I
imagine
to
lie
beyond
.
<EOS>
I
know
a
tree
grow
close
up
to
the
window
,
for
though
there
be
as
yet
no
leave
to
rustle
,
I
often
hear
at
night
the
tapping
of
branch
against
the
pane
.
<EOS>
in
the
daytime
,
when
I
listen
attentively
,
I
could
hear
,
even
through
the
board
,
the
voice
of
the
demoiselle
in
their
hour
of
recreation
,
and
,
to
speak
the
honest
truth
,
my
sentimental
reflection
be
occasionally
a
trifle
disarrange
by
the
not
quite
silvery
,
in
fact
the
too
often
brazen
sound
,
which
,
rise
from
the
unseen
paradise
below
,
penetrate
clamorously
into
my
solitude
.
<EOS>
not
to
mince
matter
,
it
really
seem
to
me
a
doubtful
case
whether
the
lung
of
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
's
girl
or
those
of
M.
Pelet
's
boy
be
the
strong
,
and
when
it
come
to
shriek
the
girl
indisputably
beat
the
boy
hollow
.
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
say
,
by
-
the
-
by
,
that
Reuter
be
the
name
of
the
old
lady
who
have
have
my
window
beard
up
.
<EOS>
I
say
old
,
for
such
I
,
of
course
,
conclude
her
to
be
,
judge
from
her
cautious
,
chaperon
-
like
proceeding
;
besides
,
nobody
ever
speak
of
her
as
young
.
<EOS>
I
remember
I
be
very
much
amused
when
I
first
hear
her
christian
name
;
it
be
Zoraide
 
Mademoiselle
Zoraide
Reuter
.
<EOS>
but
the
continental
nation
do
allow
themselves
vagary
in
the
choice
of
name
,
such
as
we
sober
English
never
run
into
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
indeed
,
we
have
too
limit
a
list
to
choose
from
.
  
<EOS>
meantime
my
path
be
gradually
grow
smooth
before
me
.
<EOS>
I
,
in
a
few
week
,
conquer
the
teasing
difficulty
inseparable
from
the
commencement
of
almost
every
career
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
I
have
acquire
as
much
facility
in
speak
French
as
set
me
at
my
ease
with
my
pupil
;
and
as
I
have
encounter
them
on
a
right
footing
at
the
very
beginning
,
and
continue
tenaciously
to
retain
the
advantage
I
have
early
gain
,
they
never
attempt
mutiny
,
<EOS>
which
circumstance
,
all
who
be
in
any
degree
acquaint
with
the
ongoing
of
belgian
school
,
and
who
know
the
relation
in
which
professor
and
pupil
too
frequently
stand
towards
each
other
in
those
establishment
,
will
consider
an
important
and
uncommon
one
.
<EOS>
before
conclude
this
chapter
I
will
say
a
word
on
the
system
I
pursue
with
regard
to
my
class
:
<EOS>
my
experience
may
possibly
be
of
use
to
other
.
  
<EOS>
It
do
not
require
very
keen
observation
to
detect
the
character
of
the
youth
of
Brabant
,
but
it
need
a
certain
degree
of
tact
to
adopt
one
's
measure
to
their
capacity
.
<EOS>
Their
intellectual
faculty
be
generally
weak
,
their
animal
propensity
strong
;
thus
there
be
at
once
an
impotence
and
a
kind
of
inert
force
in
their
nature
;
they
be
dull
,
but
they
be
also
singularly
stubborn
,
heavy
as
lead
and
,
like
lead
,
most
difficult
to
move
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
case
,
it
would
have
be
truly
absurd
to
exact
from
them
much
in
the
way
of
mental
exertion
;
have
short
memory
,
dense
intelligence
,
feeble
reflective
power
,
they
recoil
with
repugnance
from
any
occupation
that
demand
close
study
or
deep
thought
.
<EOS>
have
the
abhorred
effort
be
extort
from
them
by
injudicious
and
arbitrary
measure
on
the
part
of
the
Professor
,
they
would
have
resist
as
obstinately
,
as
clamorously
,
as
desperate
swine
;
and
though
not
brave
singly
,
they
be
relentless
act
EN
MASSE
.
  
<EOS>
I
understand
that
before
my
arrival
in
M.
Pelet
's
establishment
,
the
combine
insubordination
of
the
pupil
have
effect
the
dismissal
of
more
than
one
english
master
.
<EOS>
It
be
necessary
then
to
exact
only
the
most
moderate
application
from
nature
so
little
qualified
to
apply
 
to
assist
,
in
every
practicable
way
,
understanding
so
opaque
and
contract
 
to
be
ever
gentle
,
considerate
,
yield
even
,
to
a
certain
point
,
with
disposition
so
irrationally
perverse
;
but
,
have
reach
that
culminate
point
of
indulgence
,
you
must
fix
your
foot
,
plant
it
,
root
it
in
rock
 
<EOS>
become
immutable
as
the
tower
of
Ste
.
<EOS>
Gudule
;
for
a
step
 
but
half
a
step
farther
,
and
you
would
plunge
headlong
into
the
gulf
of
imbecility
;
there
lodge
,
you
would
speedily
receive
proof
of
flemish
gratitude
and
magnanimity
in
shower
of
brabant
saliva
and
handful
of
Low
Country
mud
.
<EOS>
You
may
smooth
to
the
utmost
the
path
of
learning
,
remove
every
pebble
from
the
track
;
but
then
you
must
finally
insist
with
decision
on
the
pupil
take
your
arm
and
allow
himself
to
be
lead
quietly
along
the
prepared
road
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
bring
down
my
lesson
to
the
low
level
of
my
dull
pupil
's
capacity
 
when
I
have
show
myself
the
mild
,
the
most
tolerant
of
master
 
a
word
of
impertinence
,
a
movement
of
disobedience
,
change
me
at
once
into
a
despot
.
<EOS>
I
offer
then
but
one
alternative
 
submission
and
acknowledgment
of
error
,
or
ignominious
expulsion
.
<EOS>
this
system
answer
,
and
my
influence
,
by
degree
,
become
establish
on
a
firm
basis
.
<EOS>
"
the
boy
be
father
to
the
man
,
"
it
be
say
;
and
so
I
often
think
when
look
at
my
boy
and
remember
the
political
history
of
their
ancestor
.
<EOS>
Pelet
's
school
be
merely
an
epitome
of
the
belgian
nation
.
    
<EOS>
and
Pelet
himself
?
<EOS>
how
do
I
continue
to
like
him
?
<EOS>
oh
,
extremely
well
!
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
more
smooth
,
gentlemanlike
,
and
even
friendly
,
than
his
demeanour
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
to
endure
from
him
neither
cold
neglect
,
irritate
interference
,
nor
pretentious
assumption
of
superiority
.
<EOS>
I
fear
,
however
,
two
poor
,
hard
-
work
belgian
usher
in
the
establishment
could
not
have
say
as
much
;
to
them
the
director
's
manner
be
invariably
dry
,
stern
,
and
cool
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
perceive
once
or
twice
<EOS>
that
I
be
a
little
shocked
at
the
difference
he
make
between
them
and
me
,
and
account
for
it
by
say
,
with
a
quiet
sarcastic
smile
    
<EOS>
"
Ce
ne
<EOS>
sont
que
des
Flamands
 
allez
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
then
he
take
his
cigar
gently
from
his
lip
and
spit
on
the
paint
floor
of
the
room
in
which
we
be
sit
.
<EOS>
flamand
certainly
they
be
,
and
both
have
the
true
Flamand
physiognomy
,
where
intellectual
inferiority
be
mark
in
line
none
can
mistake
;
still
they
be
man
,
and
,
in
the
main
,
honest
man
;
and
I
could
not
see
why
their
be
aboriginal
of
the
flat
,
dull
soil
should
serve
as
a
pretext
for
treat
them
with
perpetual
severity
and
contempt
.
<EOS>
this
idea
,
of
injustice
somewhat
poison
the
pleasure
I
may
otherwise
have
derive
from
Pelet
's
soft
affable
manner
to
myself
.
<EOS>
certainly
it
be
agreeable
,
when
the
day
's
work
be
over
,
to
find
one
's
employer
an
intelligent
and
cheerful
companion
;
and
if
he
be
sometimes
a
little
sarcastic
and
sometimes
a
little
too
insinuating
,
and
if
I
do
discover
that
his
mildness
be
more
a
matter
of
appearance
than
of
reality
 
if
I
do
occasionally
suspect
the
existence
of
flint
or
steel
under
an
external
covering
of
velvet
 
still
we
be
none
of
us
perfect
;
and
weary
<EOS>
as
I
be
of
the
atmosphere
of
brutality
and
insolence
in
which
I
have
constantly
live
at
X
 
,
I
have
no
inclination
now
,
on
cast
anchor
in
calm
region
,
to
institute
at
once
a
pry
search
after
defect
that
be
scrupulously
withdraw
and
carefully
veil
from
my
view
.
<EOS>
I
be
willing
to
take
Pelet
for
what
he
seem
 
to
believe
him
benevolent
and
friendly
until
some
untoward
event
should
prove
him
otherwise
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
married
,
and
I
soon
perceive
he
have
all
a
Frenchman
's
,
all
a
Parisian
's
notion
about
matrimony
and
woman
.
<EOS>
I
suspect
a
degree
of
laxity
in
his
code
of
moral
,
there
be
something
so
cold
and
blase
in
his
tone
whenever
he
allude
to
what
he
call
"
le
beau
sexe
;
"
but
he
be
too
gentlemanlike
to
intrude
topic
I
do
not
invite
,
and
as
he
be
really
intelligent
and
really
fond
of
intellectual
subject
of
discourse
,
he
and
I
always
find
enough
to
talk
about
,
without
seek
theme
in
the
mire
.
<EOS>
I
hate
his
fashion
of
mention
love
;
I
abhor
,
from
my
soul
,
mere
licentiousness
.
<EOS>
He
feel
the
difference
of
our
notion
,
and
,
by
mutual
consent
,
we
keep
off
ground
debateable
.
  
<EOS>
Pelet
's
house
be
keep
and
his
kitchen
manage
by
his
mother
,
a
real
old
Frenchwoman
;
she
have
be
handsome
 
<EOS>
at
least
she
tell
me
so
,
and
I
strove
to
believe
her
<EOS>
;
she
be
now
ugly
,
as
only
continental
old
woman
can
be
;
perhaps
,
though
,
her
style
of
dress
make
her
look
uglier
than
she
really
be
.
<EOS>
indoors
she
would
go
about
without
cap
,
her
grey
hair
strangely
dishevel
;
then
,
when
at
home
,
she
seldom
wear
a
gown
 
only
a
shabby
cotton
camisole
;
shoe
,
too
,
be
stranger
to
her
foot
,
and
in
lieu
of
them
she
sport
roomy
slipper
,
trodden
down
at
the
heel
.
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
whenever
it
be
her
pleasure
to
appear
abroad
,
as
on
Sundays
and
fete
-
day
,
she
would
put
on
some
very
brilliant
-
coloured
dress
,
usually
of
thin
texture
,
a
silk
bonnet
with
a
wreath
of
flower
,
and
a
very
fine
shawl
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
,
in
the
main
,
an
ill
-
natured
old
woman
,
but
an
incessant
and
most
indiscreet
talker
;
she
keep
chiefly
in
and
about
the
kitchen
,
and
seem
rather
to
avoid
her
son
's
august
presence
;
of
him
,
indeed
,
she
evidently
stand
in
awe
.
<EOS>
when
he
reprove
her
,
his
reproofs
be
bitter
and
unsparing
;
but
he
seldom
give
himself
that
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Pelet
have
her
own
society
,
her
own
circle
of
choose
visitor
,
whom
,
however
,
I
seldom
see
,
as
she
generally
entertain
them
in
what
she
call
her
"
cabinet
,
"
a
small
den
of
a
place
adjoin
the
kitchen
,
and
descend
into
it
by
one
or
two
step
.
<EOS>
on
these
step
,
by
-
the
-
by
,
I
have
not
unfrequently
see
Madame
Pelet
seat
with
a
trencher
on
her
knee
,
engage
in
the
threefold
employment
of
eat
her
dinner
,
gossip
with
her
favourite
servant
,
the
housemaid
,
and
scold
her
antagonist
,
the
cook
;
she
never
dine
,
and
seldom
indeed
take
any
meal
with
her
son
;
and
as
to
show
her
face
at
the
boy
'
table
,
that
be
quite
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
these
detail
will
sound
very
odd
in
English
ear
,
but
Belgium
be
not
England
,
and
its
way
be
not
our
way
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Pelet
's
habit
of
life
,
then
,
be
take
into
consideration
,
I
be
a
good
deal
surprise
when
,
one
Thursday
evening
(
Thursday
be
always
a
half
-
holiday
)
,
as
I
be
sit
all
alone
in
my
apartment
,
correct
a
huge
pile
of
english
and
latin
exercise
,
a
servant
tap
at
the
door
,
and
,
on
its
be
open
,
present
Madame
Pelet
's
compliment
,
and
she
would
be
happy
to
see
me
to
take
my
"
gouter
"
(
a
meal
which
answer
to
our
english
"
tea
"
)
with
her
in
the
dining
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Plait
-
il
?
"
say
I
,
for
I
think
I
must
have
misunderstood
,
the
message
and
invitation
be
so
unusual
;
the
same
word
be
repeat
.
<EOS>
I
accept
,
of
course
,
and
as
I
descend
the
stair
,
I
wonder
what
whim
have
enter
the
old
lady
's
brain
;
her
son
be
out
 
go
to
pass
the
evening
at
the
Salle
of
the
Grande
Harmonie
or
some
other
club
of
which
he
be
a
member
.
<EOS>
just
as
I
lay
my
hand
on
the
handle
of
the
dining
-
room
door
,
a
queer
idea
glance
across
my
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
surely
she
be
not
go
to
make
love
to
me
,
"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
I
have
hear
of
old
Frenchwomen
do
odd
thing
in
that
line
;
and
the
gouter
?
<EOS>
They
generally
begin
such
affair
with
eating
and
drink
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
fearful
dismay
in
this
suggestion
of
my
excited
imagination
,
and
if
I
have
allow
myself
time
to
dwell
upon
it
,
I
should
no
doubt
have
cut
there
and
then
,
rush
back
to
my
chamber
,
and
bolt
myself
in
;
but
whenever
a
danger
or
a
horror
be
veil
with
uncertainty
,
the
primary
wish
of
the
mind
be
to
ascertain
first
the
naked
truth
,
reserve
the
expedient
of
flight
for
the
moment
when
its
dread
anticipation
shall
be
realize
.
<EOS>
I
turn
the
door
-
handle
,
and
in
an
instant
have
cross
the
fatal
threshold
,
close
the
door
behind
me
,
and
stand
in
the
presence
of
Madame
Pelet
.
  
<EOS>
gracious
heaven
!
<EOS>
the
first
view
of
her
seem
to
confirm
my
bad
apprehension
.
<EOS>
there
she
sit
,
dress
out
in
a
light
green
muslin
gown
,
on
her
head
a
lace
cap
with
flourish
red
rose
in
the
frill
;
her
table
be
carefully
spread
;
there
be
fruit
,
cake
,
and
coffee
,
with
a
bottle
of
something
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
.
<EOS>
already
the
cold
sweat
start
on
my
brow
,
already
I
glance
back
over
my
shoulder
at
the
closed
door
,
when
,
to
my
unspeakable
relief
,
my
eye
,
wander
mildly
in
the
direction
of
the
stove
,
rest
upon
a
second
figure
,
seat
in
a
large
fauteuil
beside
it
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
woman
,
too
,
and
,
moreover
,
an
old
woman
,
and
as
fat
and
as
rubicund
as
Madame
Pelet
be
meagre
and
yellow
;
her
attire
be
likewise
very
fine
,
and
spring
flower
of
different
hue
circle
in
a
bright
wreath
<EOS>
the
crown
of
her
violet
-
colour
velvet
bonnet
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
only
time
to
make
these
general
observation
when
Madame
Pelet
,
come
forward
with
what
she
intend
should
be
a
graceful
and
elastic
step
,
thus
accost
me
:
  
<EOS>
"
monsieur
be
indeed
most
obliging
to
quit
his
book
,
his
study
,
at
the
request
of
an
insignificant
person
like
me
 
<EOS>
will
Monsieur
complete
his
kindness
by
allow
me
to
present
him
to
my
dear
friend
Madame
Reuter
,
who
reside
in
the
neighbouring
house
 
the
young
lady
'
school
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
"
think
I
,
"
I
know
she
be
old
,
"
and
I
bow
and
take
my
seat
.
<EOS>
Madame
Reuter
place
herself
at
the
table
opposite
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
like
Belgium
,
Monsieur
?
"
<EOS>
ask
she
,
in
an
accent
of
the
broad
Bruxellois
.
<EOS>
I
could
now
well
distinguish
the
difference
between
the
fine
and
pure
parisian
utterance
of
M.
Pelet
,
for
instance
,
and
the
guttural
enunciation
of
the
Flamands
.
<EOS>
I
answer
politely
,
and
then
wonder
how
so
coarse
and
clumsy
an
old
woman
as
the
one
before
me
should
be
at
the
head
of
a
lady
'
seminary
,
which
I
have
always
hear
speak
of
in
term
of
high
commendation
.
<EOS>
in
truth
there
be
something
to
wonder
at
.
<EOS>
Madame
Reuter
look
more
like
a
joyous
,
free
-
live
old
flemish
fermiere
,
or
even
a
maitresse
d'auberge
,
than
a
staid
,
grave
,
rigid
directrice
de
pensionnat
.
<EOS>
in
general
the
continental
,
or
at
least
the
belgian
old
woman
permit
themselves
a
licence
of
manner
,
speech
,
and
aspect
,
such
as
our
venerable
granddame
would
recoil
from
as
absolutely
disreputable
,
and
Madame
Reuter
's
jolly
face
bore
evidence
that
she
be
no
exception
to
the
rule
of
her
country
;
there
be
a
twinkle
and
leer
in
her
left
eye
;
her
right
<EOS>
she
keep
habitually
half
shut
,
which
I
think
very
odd
indeed
.
<EOS>
after
several
vain
attempt
to
comprehend
the
motive
of
these
two
droll
old
creature
for
invite
me
to
join
them
at
their
gouter
,
I
at
last
fairly
give
it
up
,
and
resign
myself
to
inevitable
mystification
,
I
sit
and
look
first
at
one
,
then
at
the
other
,
take
care
meantime
to
do
justice
to
the
confiture
,
cake
,
and
coffee
,
with
which
they
amply
supply
me
.
<EOS>
They
,
too
,
eat
,
and
that
with
no
delicate
appetite
,
and
have
demolish
a
large
portion
of
the
solid
,
they
propose
a
"
petit
verre
.
<EOS>
"
I
decline
.
<EOS>
not
so
Mesdames
Pelet
and
Reuter
;
each
mix
herself
what
I
think
rather
a
stiff
tumbler
of
punch
,
and
place
it
on
a
stand
near
the
stove
,
they
draw
up
their
chair
to
that
convenience
,
and
invite
me
to
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
I
obey
;
and
be
seat
fairly
between
them
,
I
be
thus
address
first
by
Madame
Pelet
,
then
by
Madame
Reuter
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
now
speak
of
business
,
"
say
Madame
Pelet
,
and
she
go
on
to
make
an
elaborate
speech
,
which
,
be
interpret
,
be
to
the
effect
that
she
have
ask
for
the
pleasure
of
my
company
that
evening
in
order
to
give
her
friend
Madame
Reuter
an
opportunity
of
broach
an
important
proposal
,
which
may
turn
out
greatly
to
my
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
"
pourvu
que
vous
soyez
sage
,
"
say
Madame
Reuter
,
"
et
<EOS>
a
vrai
dire
,
vous
en
avez
bien
l'air
.
<EOS>
take
one
drop
of
the
punch
"
(
or
ponche
,
as
she
pronounce
it
)
;
"
it
be
an
agreeable
and
wholesome
beverage
after
a
full
meal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
bow
,
but
again
decline
it
.
<EOS>
She
go
on
:
  
"
I
feel
,
"
say
she
,
after
a
solemn
sip
 
<EOS>
"
I
feel
profoundly
the
importance
of
the
commission
with
which
my
dear
daughter
have
entrust
me
,
for
you
be
aware
,
Monsieur
,
that
it
be
my
daughter
who
direct
the
establishment
in
the
next
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
yourself
,
madame
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
though
,
indeed
,
at
that
moment
I
recollect
that
it
be
call
Mademoiselle
,
not
Madame
Reuter
's
pensionnat
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
!
<EOS>
oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
I
manage
the
house
and
look
after
the
servant
,
as
my
friend
Madame
Pelet
do
for
Monsieur
her
son
 
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
you
think
I
give
lesson
in
class
 
do
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
she
laugh
loud
and
long
,
as
though
the
idea
tickle
her
fancy
amazingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Madame
be
in
the
wrong
to
laugh
,
"
<EOS>
I
observe
;
"
if
she
do
not
give
lesson
,
I
be
sure
it
be
not
because
she
can
not
;
"
and
I
whip
out
a
white
pocket
-
handkerchief
and
waft
it
,
with
a
french
grace
,
past
my
nose
,
bow
at
the
same
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quel
charmant
jeune
homme
!
<EOS>
"
murmured
Madame
Pelet
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
Madame
Reuter
,
be
less
sentimental
,
as
she
be
Flamand
and
not
French
,
only
laugh
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
a
dangerous
person
,
I
fear
,
"
say
she
;
"
if
you
can
forge
compliment
at
that
rate
,
Zoraide
will
positively
be
afraid
of
you
;
but
if
you
be
good
,
I
will
keep
your
secret
,
and
not
tell
her
how
well
you
can
flatter
.
<EOS>
now
,
listen
what
sort
of
a
proposal
she
make
to
you
.
<EOS>
She
have
hear
that
you
be
an
excellent
professor
,
and
as
she
wish
to
get
the
very
good
master
for
her
school
(
car
Zoraide
fait
tout
<EOS>
comme
une
reine
,
c'est
une
veritable
maitresse

femme
)
<EOS>
,
she
have
commission
me
to
step
over
this
afternoon
,
and
sound
Madame
Pelet
as
to
the
possibility
of
engage
you
.
<EOS>
Zoraide
be
a
wary
general
;
she
never
advance
without
first
examine
well
her
ground
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
she
would
be
pleased
if
she
know
I
have
already
disclose
her
intention
to
you
;
she
do
not
order
me
to
go
so
far
,
but
I
think
there
would
be
no
harm
in
let
you
into
the
secret
,
and
Madame
Pelet
be
of
the
same
opinion
.
<EOS>
take
care
,
however
,
you
do
not
betray
either
of
us
to
Zoraide
 
to
my
daughter
,
I
mean
;
she
be
so
discreet
and
circumspect
herself
<EOS>
,
she
can
not
understand
that
one
should
find
a
pleasure
in
gossip
a
little
 
"
  
"
C'est
absolument

<EOS>
cry
Madame
Pelet
.
  
<EOS>
"
all
the
world
be
so
change
since
our
girlhood

"
rejoin
the
other
:
"
young
people
have
such
old
head
now
.
<EOS>
but
to
return
,
Monsieur

<EOS>
Madame
Pelet
will
mention
the
subject
of
your
give
lesson
in
my
daughter
's
establishment
to
her
son
,
and
he
will
speak
to
you
;
and
then
to
-
morrow
,
you
will
step
over
to
our
house
,
and
ask
to
see
my
daughter
,
and
you
will
introduce
the
subject
as
if
the
first
intimation
of
it
have
reach
you
from
M.
Pelet
himself
,
and
be
sure
you
never
mention
my
name

I
would
not
displease
Zoraide
on
any
account

<EOS>
"
Bien
!
bien
!
"
<EOS>
interrupt
I
 
for
all
this
chatter
and
circumlocution
begin
to
bore
me
very
much
;
"
I
will
consult
M.
Pelet
,
and
the
thing
shall
be
settle
as
you
desire
.
<EOS>
good
evening
,
madame
 
I
be
infinitely
oblige
to
you

comment
!
<EOS>
vous
vous
en
allez
deja
?
<EOS>
"
exclaim
Madame
Pelet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Prenez
encore
quelquechose
,
monsieur
;
une
pomme
cuite
,
des

,
encore
une
tasse
de

?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Merci
,
merci
,
madame
 
au
revoir

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
back
at
last
out
of
the
apartment
.
  
<EOS>
have
regain
my
own
room
,
I
set
myself
to
turn
over
in
my
mind
the
incident
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
It
seem
a
queer
affair
altogether
,
and
queerly
manage
;
the
two
old
woman
have
make
quite
a
little
intricate
mess
of
it
;
still
I
find
that
the
uppermost
feeling
in
my
mind
on
the
subject
be
one
of
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
it
would
be
a
change
to
give
lesson
in
another
seminary
,
and
then
to
teach
young
lady
would
be
an
occupation
so
interesting
 
to
be
admit
at
all
into
a
lady
'
boarding
-
school
would
be
an
incident
so
new
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
besides
,
think
I
,
as
I
glance
at
the
board
window
,
"
I
shall
now
at
last
see
the
mysterious
garden
<EOS>
:
I
shall
gaze
both
on
the
angel
and
their
Eden
.
"
    
<EOS>
M.
PELET
could
not
of
course
object
to
the
proposal
make
by
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
reuter
;
permission
to
accept
such
additional
employment
,
should
it
offer
,
have
form
an
article
of
the
term
on
which
he
have
engage
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
therefore
,
arrange
in
the
course
of
next
day
that
I
should
be
at
liberty
to
give
lesson
in
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
's
establishment
four
afternoon
in
every
week
.
  
<EOS>
when
evening
come
I
prepare
to
step
over
in
order
to
seek
a
conference
with
Mademoiselle
herself
on
the
subject
;
I
have
not
have
time
to
pay
the
visit
before
,
have
be
all
day
closely
occupy
in
class
.
<EOS>
I
remember
very
well
that
before
quit
my
chamber
,
I
hold
a
brief
debate
with
myself
as
to
whether
I
should
change
my
ordinary
attire
for
something
smart
.
<EOS>
at
last
I
conclude
it
would
be
a
waste
of
labour
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
doubtless
,
"
think
I
,
"
she
be
some
stiff
old
maid
;
for
though
the
daughter
of
Madame
Reuter
,
she
may
well
number
upwards
of
forty
winter
;
besides
,
if
it
be
otherwise
,
if
she
be
both
young
and
pretty
,
I
be
not
handsome
,
and
no
dressing
can
make
me
<EOS>
so
,
therefore
I
will
go
as
I
be
.
"
<EOS>
and
off
I
start
,
cursorily
glancing
sideway
as
I
pass
the
toilet
-
table
,
surmount
by
a
looking
-
glass
:
<EOS>
a
thin
irregular
face
I
see
,
with
sunk
<EOS>
,
dark
eye
under
a
large
,
square
forehead
,
complexion
destitute
of
bloom
or
attraction
;
something
young
,
but
not
youthful
,
no
object
to
win
a
lady
's
love
,
no
butt
for
the
shaft
of
Cupid
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
soon
at
the
entrance
of
the
pensionnat
,
in
a
moment
I
have
pull
the
bell
;
in
another
moment
the
door
be
open
,
and
within
appear
a
passage
pave
alternately
with
black
and
white
marble
;
the
wall
be
paint
in
imitation
of
marble
also
;
and
at
the
far
end
open
a
glass
door
,
through
which
I
see
shrub
and
a
grass
-
plat
,
look
pleasant
in
the
sunshine
of
the
mild
spring
evening
-
for
<EOS>
it
be
now
the
middle
of
April
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
then
,
be
my
first
glimpse
of
the
garden
;
but
I
have
not
time
to
look
long
,
the
portress
,
after
have
answer
in
the
affirmative
my
question
as
to
whether
her
mistress
be
at
home
,
open
the
fold
-
door
of
a
room
to
the
left
,
and
have
usher
me
in
,
close
them
behind
me
.
<EOS>
I
find
myself
in
a
salon
with
a
very
well
-
paint
,
highly
varnished
floor
;
chair
and
sofa
cover
with
white
drapery
,
a
green
porcelain
stove
,
wall
hang
with
picture
in
gilt
frame
,
a
gilt
pendule
and
other
ornament
on
the
mantelpiece
,
<EOS>
a
large
lustre
pendent
from
the
centre
of
the
ceiling
,
mirror
,
console
,
muslin
curtain
,
and
a
handsome
centre
table
complete
the
inventory
of
furniture
.
<EOS>
all
look
extremely
clean
and
glittering
,
but
the
general
effect
would
have
be
somewhat
chilling
have
not
a
second
large
pair
of
fold
-
door
,
stand
wide
open
,
and
disclose
another
and
small
salon
,
more
snugly
furnished
,
offer
some
relief
to
the
eye
.
<EOS>
this
room
be
carpet
,
and
therein
be
a
piano
,
a
couch
,
a
chiffonniere
 
above
all
,
it
contain
a
lofty
window
with
a
crimson
curtain
,
which
,
be
undrawn
,
afford
another
glimpse
of
the
garden
,
through
the
large
,
clear
pane
,
round
which
<EOS>
some
leave
of
ivy
,
some
tendril
of
vine
be
train
.
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
Creemsvort
,
n'est
ce
pas
?
"
say
a
voice
behind
me
;
and
,
start
involuntarily
,
I
turn
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
so
take
up
with
the
contemplation
of
the
pretty
little
salon
that
I
have
not
notice
the
entrance
of
a
person
into
the
large
room
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
however
,
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
who
now
address
me
,
and
stand
close
beside
me
;
and
when
I
have
bow
with
instantaneously
recover
sang
-
froid
 
<EOS>
for
I
be
not
easily
embarrassed
 
<EOS>
I
commence
the
conversation
by
remark
on
the
pleasant
aspect
of
her
little
cabinet
,
and
the
advantage
she
have
over
M.
Pelet
in
possess
a
garden
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
say
,
"
she
often
think
so
;
"
and
add
,
"
it
be
my
garden
,
monsieur
,
which
make
me
retain
this
house
,
otherwise
I
should
probably
have
remove
to
large
and
more
commodious
premise
long
since
;
but
you
see
I
could
not
take
my
garden
with
me
,
and
I
should
scarcely
find
one
so
large
and
pleasant
anywhere
else
in
town
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
approve
her
judgment
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
have
not
see
it
yet
,
"
say
she
,
rise
;
"
come
to
the
window
and
take
a
well
view
.
<EOS>
"
I
follow
her
;
she
open
the
sash
,
and
lean
out
<EOS>
I
see
in
full
the
enclosed
demesne
which
have
hitherto
be
to
me
an
unknown
region
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
long
,
not
very
broad
strip
of
cultured
ground
,
with
an
alley
border
by
enormous
old
fruit
tree
down
the
middle
;
there
be
a
sort
of
lawn
,
a
parterre
of
rose
-
tree
,
some
flower
-
border
,
and
,
on
the
far
side
,
a
thickly
plant
copse
of
lilacs
,
laburnums
,
and
acacia
.
<EOS>
It
look
pleasant
,
to
me
 
very
pleasant
,
so
long
a
time
have
elapse
since
I
have
see
a
garden
of
any
sort
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
only
on
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
's
garden
that
my
eye
dwelt
<EOS>
;
when
I
have
take
a
view
of
her
well
-
trim
bed
and
bud
shrubbery
,
I
allow
my
glance
to
come
back
to
herself
,
nor
do
I
hastily
withdraw
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
think
to
see
a
tall
,
meagre
,
yellow
,
conventual
image
in
black
,
with
a
close
white
cap
,
bandage
under
the
chin
like
a
nun
's
head
-
gear
;
whereas
,
there
stand
by
me
a
little
and
roundly
form
woman
,
who
may
indeed
be
old
than
I
,
but
be
still
young
;
she
could
not
,
I
think
,
be
more
than
six
or
seven
and
twenty
;
she
be
as
fair
as
a
fair
englishwoman
;
she
have
no
cap
;
her
hair
be
nut
-
brown
,
and
she
wear
it
in
curl
;
pretty
her
feature
be
not
,
nor
very
soft
,
nor
very
regular
,
but
neither
be
they
in
any
degree
plain
,
and
I
already
see
cause
to
deem
them
expressive
.
<EOS>
what
be
their
predominant
cast
?
<EOS>
be
it
sagacity
?
 
<EOS>
sense
?
<EOS>
yes
,
I
think
so
;
but
I
could
scarcely
as
yet
be
sure
.
<EOS>
I
discover
,
however
,
that
there
be
a
certain
serenity
of
eye
,
and
freshness
of
complexion
,
most
pleasing
to
behold
.
<EOS>
the
colour
on
her
cheek
be
like
the
bloom
on
a
good
apple
,
which
be
as
sound
at
the
core
as
it
be
red
on
the
rind
.
  
<EOS>
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
and
I
enter
upon
business
.
<EOS>
She
say
she
be
not
absolutely
certain
of
the
wisdom
of
the
step
she
be
about
to
take
,
because
I
be
so
young
,
and
parent
may
possibly
object
to
a
professor
like
me
for
their
daughter
:
"
<EOS>
but
it
be
often
well
to
act
on
one
's
own
judgment
,
"
say
she
,
"
and
to
lead
parent
,
rather
than
be
lead
by
them
.
<EOS>
the
fitness
of
a
professor
be
not
a
matter
of
age
;
and
,
from
what
I
have
hear
,
and
from
what
I
observe
myself
,
I
would
much
rather
trust
you
than
M.
Ledru
,
the
music
-
master
,
who
be
a
married
man
of
near
fifty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
remark
that
I
hope
she
would
find
me
worthy
of
her
good
opinion
;
that
if
I
know
myself
,
I
be
incapable
of
betray
any
confidence
repose
in
me
.
"
<EOS>
Du
reste
,
"
say
she
,
"
the
surveillance
will
be
strictly
attend
to
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
she
proceed
to
discuss
the
subject
of
term
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
cautious
,
quite
on
her
guard
;
she
do
not
absolutely
bargain
,
but
she
warily
sound
me
to
find
out
what
my
expectation
may
be
;
and
when
she
could
not
get
me
to
name
a
sum
,
she
reason
and
reason
with
a
fluent
yet
quiet
circumlocution
of
speech
,
and
at
last
nail
me
down
to
five
hundred
franc
per
annum
 
not
too
much
,
but
I
agree
.
<EOS>
before
the
negotiation
be
complete
,
it
begin
to
grow
a
little
dusk
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
hasten
it
,
for
I
like
well
enough
to
sit
and
hear
her
talk
;
I
be
amuse
with
the
sort
of
business
talent
she
display
.
<EOS>
Edward
could
not
have
show
himself
more
practical
,
though
he
may
have
evince
more
coarseness
and
urgency
;
and
then
she
have
so
many
reason
,
so
many
explanation
;
and
,
after
all
,
she
succeed
in
prove
herself
quite
disintereste
and
even
liberal
.
<EOS>
at
last
she
conclude
,
she
could
say
no
more
,
because
,
as
I
acquiesce
in
all
thing
,
there
be
no
further
ground
for
the
exercise
of
her
part
of
speech
.
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
rise
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
have
sit
a
little
long
;
what
have
I
to
return
to
<EOS>
but
my
small
empty
room
?
<EOS>
and
my
eye
have
a
pleasure
in
look
at
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
,
especially
now
,
when
the
twilight
soften
her
feature
a
little
,
and
,
in
the
doubtful
dusk
,
I
could
fancy
her
forehead
as
open
as
it
be
really
elevated
,
her
mouth
touch
with
turn
of
sweetness
as
well
as
define
in
line
of
sense
.
<EOS>
when
I
rise
to
go
,
I
hold
out
my
hand
,
on
purpose
,
though
I
know
it
be
contrary
to
the
etiquette
of
foreign
habit
;
she
smile
,
and
say
    
"
ah
!
<EOS>
c'est
comme
tous
le
Anglais
,
"
but
give
me
her
hand
very
kindly
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
privilege
of
my
country
,
Mademoiselle
,
"
say
I
;
"
and
,
remember
,
I
shall
always
claim
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
laugh
a
little
,
quite
good
-
naturedly
,
and
with
the
sort
of
tranquillity
obvious
in
all
she
do
 
a
tranquillity
which
soothe
and
suit
me
singularly
,
at
least
I
think
so
that
evening
.
<EOS>
Brussels
seem
a
very
pleasant
place
to
me
when
I
get
out
again
into
the
street
,
and
it
appear
as
if
some
cheerful
,
eventful
,
upward
-
tend
career
be
even
then
open
to
me
,
on
that
selfsame
mild
,
still
April
night
.
<EOS>
so
impressionable
a
being
be
man
,
or
at
least
such
a
man
as
I
be
in
those
day
.
    
<EOS>
NEXT
day
the
morning
hour
seem
to
pass
very
slowly
at
M.
Pelet
's
;
I
want
the
afternoon
to
come
that
I
may
go
again
to
the
neighbouring
pensionnat
and
give
my
first
lesson
within
its
pleasant
precinct
;
for
pleasant
they
appear
to
me
.
<EOS>
at
noon
the
hour
of
recreation
arrive
;
at
one
o'clock
we
have
lunch
;
this
get
on
the
time
,
and
at
last
St.
Gudule
's
deep
bell
,
toll
slowly
two
,
mark
the
moment
for
which
I
have
be
wait
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
foot
of
the
narrow
back
-
stair
that
descend
from
my
room
,
I
meet
M.
Pelet
.
  
<EOS>
"
comme
vous
avez
l'air
rayonnant
!
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Je
<EOS>
ne
vous
ai
jamais
vu
aussi
gai
.
<EOS>
Que
s'est
-
il
donc
passe
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
apparemment
que
j'aime
les
changement
,
"
reply
i.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
je
comprend
 
c'est
cela
 
soyez
sage
seulement
.
<EOS>
vous
ete
bien
jeune
 
<EOS>
trop
jeune
pour
le
role
que
vous
allez
jouer
;
il
faut
prendre

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mais
quel

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Je
n'en
sais
rien
 
<EOS>
ne
vous
laissez
pas
aller
a
de

impression
 
voila
tout
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
laugh
:
a
sentiment
of
exquisite
pleasure
play
over
my
nerve
at
the
thought
that
"
vive
impression
"
be
likely
to
be
create
;
it
be
the
deadness
,
<EOS>
the
sameness
of
life
's
daily
ongoing
that
have
hitherto
be
my
bane
;
my
blouse
-
clothe
"
eleve
"
in
the
boy
'
seminary
never
stir
in
me
any
"
vive
impression
"
except
it
may
be
occasionally
some
of
anger
.
<EOS>
I
break
from
M.
Pelet
,
and
as
I
strode
down
the
passage
he
follow
me
with
one
of
his
laugh
 
a
very
french
,
rakish
,
mock
sound
.
  
<EOS>
again
I
stand
at
the
neighbouring
door
,
and
soon
be
re
-
admit
into
the
cheerful
passage
with
its
clear
dove
-
colour
imitation
marble
wall
.
<EOS>
I
follow
the
portress
,
and
descend
a
step
,
and
make
a
turn
,
I
find
myself
in
a
sort
of
corridor
;
a
side
-
door
open
,
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
's
little
figure
,
as
graceful
as
it
be
plump
,
appear
.
<EOS>
I
could
now
see
her
dress
in
full
daylight
;
a
neat
,
simple
mousseline
-
laine
gown
fit
her
compact
round
shape
to
perfection
 
delicate
little
collar
and
manchette
of
lace
,
trim
parisian
brodequin
show
her
neck
,
wrist
,
and
foot
,
to
complete
advantage
;
but
how
grave
be
her
face
as
she
come
suddenly
upon
me
!
<EOS>
solicitude
and
business
be
in
her
eye
 
on
her
forehead
;
she
look
almost
stern
.
<EOS>
Her
"
Bon
jour
,
monsieur
,
"
be
quite
polite
,
but
so
orderly
,
<EOS>
so
commonplace
,
it
spread
directly
a
cool
,
damp
towel
over
my
"
vive
impression
.
<EOS>
"
the
servant
turn
back
when
her
mistress
appear
,
and
I
walk
slowly
along
the
corridor
,
side
by
side
with
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
will
give
a
lesson
in
the
first
class
to
-
day
,
"
say
she
;
<EOS>
"
dictation
or
reading
will
perhaps
be
the
good
thing
to
begin
with
,
for
those
be
the
easy
form
of
communicate
instruction
in
a
foreign
language
;
and
,
at
the
first
,
a
master
naturally
feel
a
little
unsettled
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
quite
right
,
as
I
have
find
from
experience
;
it
only
remain
for
me
to
acquiesce
.
<EOS>
We
proceed
now
in
silence
.
<EOS>
the
corridor
terminate
in
a
hall
,
large
,
lofty
,
and
square
;
a
glass
door
on
one
side
show
within
a
long
narrow
refectory
,
with
table
,
an
armoire
,
and
two
lamp
;
it
be
empty
;
large
glass
door
,
in
front
,
open
on
the
playground
and
garden
;
a
broad
staircase
ascend
spirally
on
the
opposite
side
;
the
remain
wall
show
a
pair
of
great
folding
-
door
,
now
closed
,
and
admitting
,
doubtless
,
to
the
class
.
  
<EOS>
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
turn
her
eye
laterally
on
me
,
to
ascertain
,
probably
,
whether
I
be
collect
enough
to
be
usher
into
her
sanctum
sanctorum
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
judge
me
to
be
in
a
tolerable
state
of
self
-
government
,
for
she
open
the
door
,
and
I
follow
her
through
.
<EOS>
a
rustle
sound
of
uprising
greet
our
entrance
;
without
look
to
the
right
or
leave
,
I
walk
straight
up
the
lane
between
two
set
of
bench
and
desk
,
and
take
possession
of
the
empty
chair
and
isolate
desk
raise
on
an
estrade
,
of
one
step
high
,
so
as
to
command
one
division
;
the
other
division
be
under
the
surveillance
of
a
maitresse
similarly
elevate
.
<EOS>
at
the
back
of
the
estrade
,
and
attach
to
a
moveable
partition
divide
this
schoolroom
from
another
beyond
,
be
a
large
tableau
of
wood
paint
black
and
varnish
;
a
thick
crayon
of
white
chalk
lie
on
my
desk
for
the
convenience
of
elucidate
any
grammatical
or
verbal
obscurity
which
may
occur
in
my
lesson
by
write
it
upon
the
tableau
;
a
wet
sponge
appear
beside
the
chalk
,
to
enable
me
to
efface
the
mark
when
they
have
serve
the
purpose
intend
.
  
<EOS>
I
carefully
and
deliberately
make
these
observation
before
allow
myself
to
take
one
glance
at
the
bench
before
me
;
have
handle
the
crayon
,
look
back
at
the
tableau
,
finger
the
sponge
in
order
to
ascertain
that
it
be
in
a
right
state
of
moisture
<EOS>
,
I
find
myself
cool
enough
to
admit
of
look
calmly
up
and
gaze
deliberately
round
me
.
  
<EOS>
and
first
I
observe
that
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
have
already
glide
away
,
she
be
nowhere
visible
;
a
maitresse
or
teacher
,
the
one
who
occupy
the
corresponding
estrade
to
my
own
,
alone
remain
to
keep
guard
over
me
;
she
be
a
little
in
the
shade
,
and
,
with
my
short
sight
,
I
could
only
see
that
she
be
of
a
thin
bony
figure
and
rather
tallowy
complexion
,
and
that
her
attitude
,
as
she
sit
,
partook
equally
of
listlessness
and
affectation
.
<EOS>
more
obvious
,
more
prominent
,
shine
on
by
the
full
light
of
the
large
window
,
be
the
occupant
of
the
bench
just
before
me
,
of
whom
some
be
girl
of
fourteen
,
fifteen
,
sixteen
,
some
young
woman
from
eighteen
(
as
it
appear
to
me
)
up
to
twenty
;
the
most
modest
attire
,
the
simple
fashion
of
wear
the
hair
,
be
apparent
in
all
;
and
good
feature
,
ruddy
,
bloom
complexion
,
large
and
brilliant
eye
,
form
full
,
even
to
solidity
,
seem
to
abound
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
bear
the
first
view
like
a
stoic
;
I
be
dazzle
,
my
eye
fall
,
and
in
a
voice
somewhat
too
low
I
murmur
    
"
Prenez
vos
cahier
de
dictee
,
mademoiselle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
not
so
have
I
bid
the
boy
at
Pelet
's
<EOS>
take
their
reading
-
book
.
<EOS>
a
rustle
follow
,
and
an
opening
of
desk
;
behind
the
lifted
lid
which
momentarily
screen
the
head
bend
down
to
search
for
exercise
-
book
,
I
hear
titter
and
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eulalie
,
je
suis
prete
a
pleuer
de
rire
,
"
observe
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
Comme
il
a
rougi
en
parlant
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oui

c'est
un

bec

"
  
<EOS>
"
Tais
-
toi

Hortense
 
il

ecoute

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
now
the
lid
sink
and
the
head
reappear
<EOS>
;
I
have
mark
three
,
the
whisperer
,
and
I
do
not
scruple
to
take
a
very
steady
look
at
them
as
they
emerge
from
their
temporary
eclipse
.
<EOS>
It
be
astonish
what
ease
and
courage
their
little
phrase
of
flippancy
have
give
me
;
the
idea
by
which
I
have
be
awe
be
that
the
youthful
being
before
me
,
with
their
dark
nun
-
like
robe
and
softly
braid
hair
,
be
a
kind
of
half
-
angel
.
<EOS>
the
light
titter
,
the
giddy
whisper
,
have
already
in
some
measure
relieve
my
mind
of
that
fond
and
oppressive
fancy
.
  
<EOS>
the
three
I
allude
to
be
just
in
front
,
within
half
a
yard
of
my
estrade
,
and
be
among
the
most
womanly
-
look
present
.
<EOS>
Their
name
I
know
afterwards
,
and
may
as
well
mention
now
;
they
be
Eulalie
,
Hortense
,
Caroline
.
<EOS>
Eulalie
be
tall
,
and
very
finely
shape
:
she
be
fair
,
and
her
feature
be
those
of
a
Low
Country
Madonna
;
many
a
"
figure
de
Vierge
"
<EOS>
have
I
see
in
dutch
picture
exactly
resemble
her
;
there
be
no
angle
in
her
shape
or
in
her
face
,
all
be
curve
and
roundness
 
neither
thought
,
sentiment
,
nor
passion
disturb
by
line
or
flush
the
equality
of
her
pale
,
clear
skin
;
her
noble
bust
heave
with
her
regular
breathing
,
her
eye
move
a
little
 
by
these
evidence
of
life
alone
<EOS>
could
I
have
distinguish
her
from
some
large
handsome
figure
mould
in
wax
.
<EOS>
Hortense
be
of
middle
size
and
stout
,
her
form
be
ungraceful
,
her
face
strike
,
more
alive
and
brilliant
than
Eulalie
's
,
her
hair
be
dark
brown
,
<EOS>
her
complexion
richly
colour
;
there
be
frolic
and
mischief
in
her
eye
:
consistency
and
good
sense
she
may
possess
,
but
none
of
her
feature
betoken
those
quality
.
  
<EOS>
Caroline
be
little
,
though
evidently
full
grown
;
raven
-
black
hair
,
very
dark
eye
,
absolutely
regular
feature
,
with
a
colourless
olive
complexion
,
clear
as
to
the
face
and
sallow
about
the
neck
,
form
in
her
that
assemblage
of
point
whose
union
many
person
regard
as
the
perfection
of
beauty
.
<EOS>
how
,
with
the
tintless
pallor
of
her
skin
and
the
classic
straightness
of
her
lineament
,
she
manage
to
look
sensual
,
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
I
think
her
lip
and
eye
contrive
the
affair
between
them
,
and
the
result
leave
no
uncertainty
on
the
beholder
's
mind
.
<EOS>
She
be
sensual
now
,
and
in
ten
year
'
time
she
would
be
coarse
 
<EOS>
promise
plain
be
write
in
her
face
of
much

Eulalie
raise
her

to

securely
,
an

regard
me
boldly

at

with
an

at

these

at

themselves

by

they

all

in

they

thus

their

in

"

she
rise
up

walk
over

the

I
look
at

I
,

I
deliberately
tear
her

present
her
with
the
fragment

I
return

her

the

the
conceited
coquetry

futile
flirtation
of

bench
be
exchange
for
a
taciturn
sullenness
,
much
more
convenient
to
me
,
and
the
rest
of
my

pass
without
interruption
.
  
<EOS>
a
bell
clang
out
in
the
yard
announce
the
moment
for
the
cessation
of
school
labour

<EOS>
I
hear
our
own
bell
at
the

time
,
and
that
of
a
certain
public
college
immediately
after

<EOS>
order
dissolve
instantly
;
up
start
every

I
hasten
to
seize
my

,
bow
to
the
maitresse

and
quit
the
room
before
the
tide
of
externat
should
pour
from
the
inner
class
,
where
I
know
near
a
hundred

prisone

and
whose

I
have
scarcely
cross

the

she

open
the

side

she
have
issue
on

it

the

tear
down
their

the
shrill
voice
of
a
maitresse
be
hear
at
interval
vainly
endeavour
to
enforce
some
sort
of
order
;
vainly
,
I
say
:
discipline
there
be
none
in
these
rough
rank

and
yet
this
be
consider
one
of
the
best

reuter
in

only
by
a

<EOS>
"
be
you
satisfied

conceal
nothing
from

repose
in
me
entire
confidence

"
  
<EOS>
happily
,
I
feel
in
myself
complete
power
to
manage
my
pupil
without
aid
;
the
enchantment
,
the
golden
haze
which
have
dazzle
my
perspicuity
at
first
,
have
be
a
good
deal
dissipate
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
I
be
chagrin
or
downcast
by
the
contrast
which
the
reality
of
a
pensionnat
de
demoiselle
present
to
my
vague
ideal
of
the
same
community
;
I
be
only
enlighten
and
amuse
;
consequently
,
I
feel
in
no
disposition
to
complain
to
Mdlle

<EOS>
Reuter
,
and
<EOS>
I
receive
her
considerate
invitation
to
confidence
with
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
a

She
look
more
than
doubtful

be
my
answer
,
and
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
cease
to
question
me
;
but
her
eye
 
not
large
,
not
brilliant
,
not
melt
,
or
kindle
,
but
astute
,
penetrating
,
practical
,
show
she
be
even
with
me
;
it
let
out
a
momentary
gleam
,
which
say
plainly
,
"
be
as
close
as
you
like
,
I
be
not
dependent
on
your
candour
;
what
you
would
conceal
I
already
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
by
a
transition
so
quiet
as
to
be
scarcely
perceptible
,
the
directress
's
manner
change
;
the
anxious
business
-
air
pass
from
her
face
,
and
she
begin
chat
about
the
weather
and
the
town
,
and
ask
in
neighbourly
wise
after
M.
and
Madame
Pelet
.
<EOS>
I
answer
all
her
little
question
;
she
prolong
her
talk
,
I
go
on
follow
its
many
little
winding
;
she
sit
so
long
,
say
so
much
,
varied
so
often
the
topic
of
discourse
,
that
it
be
not
difficult
to
perceive
she
have
a
particular
aim
in
thus
detain
me
.
<EOS>
Her
mere
word
could
have
afford
no
clue
to
this
aim
,
but
her
countenance
aid
;
while
her
lip
utter
only
affable
commonplace
,
her
eye
revert
continually
to
my
face
.
<EOS>
Her
glance
be
not
give
in
full
,
but
out
of
the
corner
,
so
quietly
,
so
stealthily
,
yet
I
think
I
lose
not
one
.
<EOS>
I
watch
her
as
keenly
as
she
watch
me
;
I
perceive
soon
that
she
be
feel
after
my
real
character
;
she
be
search
for
salient
point
,
and
weak
point
,
and
eccentric
point
;
she
be
apply
now
this
test
,
now
that
,
hope
in
the
end
to
find
some
chink
,
some
niche
,
where
she
could
put
in
her
little
firm
foot
and
stand
upon
my
neck
 
mistress
of
my
nature
.
<EOS>
do
not
mistake
me
,
reader
,
it
be
no
amorous
influence
she
wish
to
gain
 
at
that
time
<EOS>
it
be
only
the
power
of
the
politician
to
which
she
aspire
;
I
be
now
instal
as
a
professor
in
her
establishment
,
and
she
want
to
know
where
her
mind
be
superior
to
mine
 
by
what
feeling
or
opinion
<EOS>
she
could
lead
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
enjoy
the
game
much
,
and
do
not
hasten
its
conclusion
;
sometimes
I
give
her
hope
,
begin
a
sentence
rather
weakly
,
when
her
shrewd
eye
would
light
up
 
<EOS>
she
think
she
have
me
;
have
lead
her
a
little
way
,
I
delight
to
turn
round
and
finish
with
sound
,
hard
sense
,
whereat
her
countenance
would
fall
.
<EOS>
at
last
a
servant
enter
to
announce
dinner
;
the
conflict
be
thus
necessarily
terminate
,
we
part
without
have
gain
any
advantage
on
either
side
:
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
have
not
even
give
me
an
opportunity
of
attack
her
with
feeling
,
and
I
have
manage
to
baffle
her
little
scheme
of
craft
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
regular
draw
battle
.
<EOS>
I
again
hold
out
my
hand
when
I
leave
the
room
,
she
give
me
her
;
it
be
a
small
and
white
hand
,
but
how
cool
!
<EOS>
I
meet
her
eye
too
in
full
 
oblige
her
to
give
me
a
straightforward
look
;
this
last
test
go
against
me
:
it
leave
her
as
it
find
her
 
moderate
,
temperate
,
tranquil
;
me
it
disappoint
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
grow
wise
,
"
think
I
,
as
I
walk
back
to
M.
Pelet
's
.
<EOS>
"
look
at
this
little
woman
;
be
she
like
the
woman
of
novelist
and
romancer
?
<EOS>
to
read
of
female
character
as
depict
in
Poetry
and
Fiction
,
one
would
think
it
be
make
up
of
sentiment
,
either
for
good
or
bad
 
here
be
a
speciman
,
and
a
most
sensible
and
respectable
speciman
,
too
,
whose
staple
ingredient
be
abstract
reason
.
<EOS>
no
Talleyrand
be
ever
more
passionless
than
Zoraide
Reuter
!
"
<EOS>
so
I
think
then
;
I
find
afterwards
that
blunt
susceptibility
be
very
consistent
with
strong
propensity
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
indeed
have
a
very
long
talk
with
the
crafty
little
politician
,
and
on
regain
my
quarter
,
I
find
that
dinner
be
half
over
.
<EOS>
to
be
late
at
meal
be
against
a
stand
rule
of
the
establishment
,
and
have
it
be
one
of
the
flemish
usher
who
thus
enter
after
the
removal
of
the
soup
and
the
commencement
of
the
first
course
,
M.
Pelet
would
probably
have
greet
him
with
a
public
rebuke
,
and
would
certainly
have
mulct
him
both
of
soup
and
fish
;
as
it
be
,
that
polite
though
partial
gentleman
only
shake
his
head
,
and
as
I
take
my
place
,
unrolled
my
napkin
,
and
say
my
heretical
grace
to
myself
,
he
civilly
despatch
a
servant
to
the
kitchen
,
to
bring
me
a
plate
of
"
puree
aux
carotte
"
<EOS>
(
for
this
be
a
maigre
-
day
)
,
and
before
send
away
the
first
course
,
reserve
for
me
a
portion
of
the
stock
-
fish
of
which
it
consist
.
<EOS>
dinner
be
over
,
the
boy
rush
out
for
their
evening
play
;
Kint
and
Vandam
(
the
two
usher
)
of
course
follow
them
.
<EOS>
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
if
they
have
not
look
so
very
heavy
,
so
very
soulless
,
so
very
indifferent
to
all
thing
in
heaven
above
or
in
the
earth
<EOS>
beneath
,
I
could
have
pity
them
greatly
for
the
obligation
they
be
under
to
trail
after
those
rough
lad
everywhere
and
at
all
time
;
even
as
it
be
,
I
feel
disposed
to
scout
myself
as
a
privileged
prig
when
I
turn
to
ascend
to
my
chamber
,
sure
to
find
there
,
if
not
enjoyment
,
at
least
liberty
;
but
this
evening
(
as
have
often
happen
before
)
<EOS>
I
be
to
be
still
farther
distinguished
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
bien
,
mauvais
sujet
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
voice
of
M.
Pelet
behind
me
,
as
I
set
my
foot
on
the
first
step
of
the
stair
,
"

rejoin
M.

he
usher
me
into
the
comfortable
parlour
with
a
good

and
presently

and
I
be

almost
in
English
comfort

one
on

side
of

with

large

while
M.

employ
himself
in

<EOS>
of

it
be
both
her
intention

resolution

marry
when
she
find
a
suitable
match
,
and
no
one
be
better
aware
than
herself

she
be

no

I
may
have
laugh
at
the
director

have
I
believe
it
real
,
but
there
be
something
in
his
tone
which
indicate
get

up
rapture

I
feel
he
be
only
affect
fervour
in
order
to
put

off

to
induce

to
come
out

scarcely
even
smile

go
on
:

question
discompose
me
,

I
now
feel
plainly
that
my

be
endeavour

for

at

could
not

to
excite

be

<EOS>
the
iniquity
of
the
instigation
prove
its
antidote
,

when
he
further
add
:
    
"

<EOS>
I
reply
by
a
look

an
interrogative

startle
him

laugh

affirm
that

demand

just

rang

do
not
wait
for
my
answer

but
rise
,
leave
the
room
,
hum
as
he
go
some
gay
strain
of
Beranger

.
    
<EOS>
DAILY
,
as
I
continue
my
attendance
at
the
seminary
of
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
,
do
I
find
fresh
occasion
to
compare
the
ideal
with
the
real
.
<EOS>
what
have
I
know
of
female
character
previously
to
my
arrival
at
Brussels
?
<EOS>
precious
little
.
<EOS>
and
what
be
my
notion
of
it
?
<EOS>
something
vague
,
slight
,
gauzy
,
glitter
;
now
when
I
come
in
contact
with
it
I
find
it
to
be
a
palpable
substance
enough
;
very
hard
too
sometimes
,
and
often
heavy
<EOS>
;
there
be
metal
in
it
,
both
lead
and
iron
.
  
<EOS>
let
the
idealist
,
the
dreamer
about
earthly
angel
and
human
flower
,
just
look
here
while
I
open
my
portfolio
and
show
them
a
sketch
or
two
,
pencil
after
nature
.
<EOS>
I
take
these
sketch
in
the
second
-
class
schoolroom
of
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
's
establishment
,
where
about
a
hundred
specimen
of
the
genus
"
jeune
fille
"
collect
together
offer
a
fertile
variety
of
subject
.
<EOS>
a
miscellaneous
assortment
they
be
,
differ
both
in
caste
and
country
<EOS>
;
as
I
sit
on
my
estrade
and
glance
over
the
long
range
of
desk
,
I
have
under
my
eye
French
,
English
,
Belgians
,
Austrians
,
and
Prussians
.
<EOS>
the
majority
belong
to
the
class
bourgeois
;
but
there
be
many
countess
,
there
be
the
daughter
of
two
general
and
of
several
colonel
,
captain
,
and
government
EMPLOYES
;
these
lady
sit
side
by
side
with
young
female
destine
to
be
demoiselle
de
magasins
,
and
with
some
flamande
,
genuine
aborigine
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
in
dress
all
be
nearly
similar
,
and
in
manner
there
be
small
difference
;
exception
there
be
to
the
general
rule
,
but
the
majority
give
the
tone
to
the
establishment
,
and
that
tone
be
rough
,
boisterous
,
mask
by
a
point
-
blank
disregard
of
all
forbearance
towards
each
other
or
their
teacher
;
an
eager
pursuit
by
each
individual
of
her
own
interest
and
convenience
;
and
a
coarse
indifference
to
the
interest
and
convenience
of
every
one
else
.
<EOS>
Most
of
them
could
lie
with
audacity
when
it
appear
advantageous
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
all
understand
the
art
of
speak
fair
when
a
point
be
to
be
gain
,
and
could
with
consummate
skill
and
at
a
moment
's
notice
turn
the
cold
shoulder
the
instant
civility
cease
to
be
profitable
.
<EOS>
very
little
open
quarrelling
ever
take
place
amongst
them
;
but
backbite
and
talebeare
be
universal
.
<EOS>
close
friendship
be
forbid
by
the
rule
of
the
school
,
and
no
one
girl
seem
to
cultivate
more
regard
for
another
than
be
just
necessary
to
secure
a
companion
when
solitude
would
have
be
irksome
.
<EOS>
They
be
each
and
all
suppose
to
have
be
rear
in
utter
unconsciousness
of
vice
.
<EOS>
the
precaution
use
to
keep
them
ignorant
,
if
not
innocent
,
be
innumerable
.
<EOS>
how
be
it
,
then
,
that
scarcely
one
of
those
girl
have
attain
the
age
of
fourteen
could
look
a
man
in
the
face
with
modesty
and
propriety
?
<EOS>
an
air
of
bold
,
impudent
flirtation
,
or
a
loose
,
silly
leer
,
be
sure
to
answer
the
most
ordinary
glance
from
a
masculine
eye
.
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
of
the
arcana
of
the
roman
catholic
religion
,
and
I
be
not
a
bigot
in
matter
of
theology
,
but
I
suspect
the
root
of
this
precocious
impurity
,
so
obvious
,
so
general
in
popish
country
,
be
to
be
find
in
the
discipline
,
if
not
the
doctrine
of
the
Church
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
I
record
what
I
have
see
:
these
girl
belong
to
what
be
call
the
respectable
rank
of
society
;
they
have
all
be
carefully
bring
up
,
yet
be
the
mass
of
them
mentally
deprave
.
<EOS>
so
much
for
the
general
view
:
now
for
one
or
two
select
specimen
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
picture
be
a
full
length
of
Aurelia
Koslow
,
a
german
fraulein
,
or
rather
a
half
-
breed
between
german
and
russian
.
<EOS>
She
be
eighteen
year
of
age
,
and
have
be
send
to
Brussels
to
finish
her
education
;
she
be
of
middle
size
,
stiffly
make
,
body
long
,
leg
short
,
bust
<EOS>
much
develop
but
not
compactly
mould
,
waist
disproportionately
compress
by
an
inhumanly
braced
corset
,
dress
carefully
arrange
,
large
foot
torture
into
small
bottine
,
head
small
,
hair
smooth
,
braid
,
oil
,
and
gum
to
perfection
;
very
low
forehead
,
very
diminutive
and
vindictive
grey
eye
,
somewhat
Tartar
feature
,
rather
flat
nose
,
rather
high
-
cheek
bone
,
yet
the
ensemble
not
positively
ugly
;
tolerably
good
complexion
.
<EOS>
so
much
for
person
.
<EOS>
as
to
mind
,
deplorably
ignorant
and
ill
-
inform
:
incapable
of
write
or
speak
correctly
even
german
,
her
native
tongue
,
a
dunce
in
French
,
and
her
attempt
at
learn
English
a
mere
farce
,
yet
she
have
be
at
school
twelve
year
;
but
as
she
invariably
get
her
exercise
,
of
every
description
,
do
by
a
fellow
pupil
,
and
read
her
lesson
off
a
book
conceal
in
her
lap
,
it
be
not
wonderful
that
her
progress
have
be
so
snail
-
like
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
Aurelia
's
daily
habit
of
life
be
,
because
I
have
not
the
opportunity
of
observe
her
at
all
time
;
but
from
what
I
see
of
the
state
of
her
desk
,
book
,
and
paper
,
I
should
say
she
be
slovenly
and
even
dirty
;
her
outward
dress
,
as
I
have
say
,
be
well
attend
to
,
but
in
pass
behind
her
bench
,
I
have
remark
that
her
neck
be
gray
for
want
of
washing
,
and
her
hair
,
so
glossy
with
gum
and
grease
,
be
not
such
as
one
feel
tempt
to
pass
the
hand
over
,
much
less
to
run
the
finger
through
.
<EOS>
Aurelia
's
conduct
in
class
,
at
least
when
I
be
present
,
be
something
extraordinary
,
consider
as
an
index
of
girlish
innocence
.
<EOS>
the
moment
I
enter
the
room
,
she
nudge
her
next
neighbour
and
indulge
in
a
half
-
suppress
laugh
.
<EOS>
as
I
take
my
seat
on
the
estrade
,
she
fix
her
eye
on
me
;
she
seem
resolve
to
attract
,
and
,
if
possible
,
monopolize
my
notice
:
to
this
end
she
launch
at
me
all
sort
of
look
,
languish
,
provoke
,
leer
,
laugh
.
<EOS>
as
I
be
find
quite
proof
against
this
sort
of
artillery
 
for
we
scorn
what
,
unasked
,
be
lavishly
offer
 
<EOS>
she
have
recourse
to
the
expedient
of
make
noise
;
sometimes
she
sigh
,
sometimes
groan
,
<EOS>
sometimes
utter
inarticulate
sound
,
for
which
language
have
no
name
.
<EOS>
if
,
in
walk
up
the
schoolroom
,
I
pass
near
her
,
she
put
out
her
foot
that
it
may
touch
mine
;
if
I
do
not
happen
to
observe
the
manoeuvre
,
and
my
boot
come
in
contact
with
her
brodequin
,
she
affect
to
fall
into
convulsion
of
suppress
laughter
;
if
I
notice
the
snare
and
avoid
it
,
she
express
her
mortification
in
sullen
muttering
,
where
I
hear
myself
abused
in
bad
French
,
pronounce
with
an
intolerable
low
german
accent
.
  
<EOS>
not
far
from
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Koslow
sit
another
young
lady
by
name
Adele
Dronsart
:
this
be
a
belgian
,
rather
low
of
stature
,
in
form
heavy

with
broad
waist
,
short
neck
and
limb
,
good
red
and
white
complexion

feature
well
chiselled
and
regular

well

cut
eye
of
a
clear
brown
colour
,
light
brown
hair
,
good
tooth
,
age
not
much
above
fifteen
,
but
as
full
-
grown
as
a
stout
young
Englishwoman
of
twenty
.
<EOS>
this
portrait
give
the
idea
of
a
somewhat
dumpy
but
good
-
look
damsel
,
do
it
not
?
<EOS>
well
,
when
I
look
along
the
row
of
young
head
,
my
eye
generally
stop
at
this
of
Adele
's
;
her
gaze
be
ever
wait
for
mine
,
and
it
frequently
succeed
in
arrest
it
.
<EOS>
She
be
<EOS>
an
unnatural
-
look
be
 
so
young
,
fresh
,
blooming
,
yet
<EOS>
so
Gorgon
-
like
.
<EOS>
suspicion
,
sullen
ill
-
temper
be
on
her
forehead
,
vicious
propensity
in
her
eye
,
envy
and
panther
-
like
deceit
about
her
mouth
.
<EOS>
in
general
she
sit
very
still
;
her
massive
shape
look
as
if
it
could
not
bend
much
,
nor
do
her
large
head
 
so
broad
at
the
base
,
so
narrow
towards
the
top
 
seem
make
to
turn
readily
on
her
short
neck
.
<EOS>
She
have
but
two
variety
of
expression
;
the
prevalent
one
a
forbidding
,
dissatisfied
scowl
,
varied
sometimes
by
a
most
pernicious
and
perfidious
smile
.
<EOS>
She
be
shun
by
her
fellow
-
pupil
,
for
,
bad
as
many
of
them
be
,
few
be
as
bad
as
she
.
  
<EOS>
Aurelia
and
Adele
be
in
the
first
division
of
the
second
class
;
the
second
division
be
head
by
a
pensionnaire
name
Juanna
Trista
.
<EOS>
this
girl
be
of
mixed
belgian
and
spanish
origin
;
her
flemish
mother
be
dead
,
her
catalonian
father
be
a
merchant
reside
in
the
 
Isles
,
where
Juanna
have
be
bear
and
whence
she
be
send
to
Europe
to
be
educate
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
that
any
one
,
look
at
that
girl
's
head
and
countenance
,
would
have
receive
her
under
their
roof
.
<EOS>
She
have
precisely
the
same
shape
of
skull
as
Pope
Alexander
the
Sixth
;
her
organ
of
benevolence
,
veneration
,
conscientiousness
,
adhesiveness
,
be
singularly
small
,
those
of
self
-
esteem
,
firmness
,
destructiveness
,
combativeness
,
preposterously
large
;
her
head
slope
up
in
the
penthouse
shape
,
be
contract
about
the
forehead
,
and
prominent
behind
;
she
have
rather
good
,
though
large
and
marked
feature
;
her
temperament
be
fibrous
and
bilious
,
her
complexion
pale
and
dark
,
hair
and
eye
black
,
form
angular
and
rigid
but
proportionate
,
age
fifteen
.
  
<EOS>
Juanna
be
not
very
thin
,
but
she
have
a
gaunt
visage
,
and
her
"
regard
"
be
fierce
and
hungry
;
narrow
as
be
her
brow
,
it
present
space
enough
for
the
legible
graving
of
two
word
,
Mutiny
and
Hate
;
in
some
one
of
her
other
lineament
I
think
the
eye
 
cowardice
have
also
its
distinct
cipher
.
<EOS>
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Trista
think
fit
to
trouble
my
first
lesson
with
a
coarse
work
-
day
sort
of
turbulence
;
she
make
noise
with
her
mouth
like
a
horse
,
she
eject
her
saliva
,
she
utter
brutal
expression
;
behind
and
below
her
be
seat
a
band
of
very
vulgar
,
inferior
-
look
flamande
,
include
two
or
three
example
of
that
deformity
of
person
and
imbecility
of
intellect
whose
frequency
in
the
Low
Countries
would
seem
to
furnish
proof
that
the
climate
be
such
as
to
induce
degeneracy
of
the
human
mind
and
body
;
these
,
I
soon
find
,
be
completely
under
her
influence
,
and
with
their
aid
she
get
up
and
sustain
a
swinish
tumult
,
which
I
be
constrain
at
last
to
quell
by
order
her
and
two
of
her
tool
to
rise
from
their
seat
,
and
,
have
keep
them
stand
five
minute
,
turn
them
bodily
out
of
the
schoolroom
:
<EOS>
the
accomplice
into
a
large
place
adjoin
call
the
grand
salle
;
the
principal
into
a
cabinet
,
of
which
I
close
the
door
and
pocket
the
key
.
<EOS>
this
judgment
I
execute
in
the
presence
of
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
,
who
look
much
aghast
at
behold
so
decide
a
proceeding
 
the
most
severe
that
have
ever
be
venture
on
in
her
establishment
.
<EOS>
Her
look
of
affright
<EOS>
I
answer
with
one
of
composure
,
and
finally
with
a
smile
,
which
perhaps
flatter
,
and
certainly
soothe
her
.
<EOS>
Juanna
Trista
remain
in
Europe
long
enough
to
repay
,
by
malevolence
and
ingratitude
,
all
who
have
ever
do
her
a
good
turn
;
and
she
then
go
to
join
her
father
in
the
  
Isles
,
exult
in
the
thought
that
she
should
there
have
slave
,
whom
,
as
she
say
,
she
could
kick
and
strike
at
will
.
  
<EOS>
these
three
picture
be
from
the
life
.
<EOS>
I
possess
other
,
as
mark
and
as
little
agreeable
,
but
I
will
spare
my
reader
the
exhibition
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
doubtless
it
will
be
think
that
I
ought
now
,
by
way
of
contrast
,
to
show
something
charming
;
some
gentle
virgin
head
,
circle
with
a
halo
,
some
sweet
personification
of
innocence
,
clasp
the
dove
of
peace
to
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
no
:
I
see
nothing
of
the
sort
,
and
therefore
can
not
portray
it
.
<EOS>
the
pupil
in
the
school
possess
the
happy
disposition
be
a
young
girl
from
the
country
,
Louise
Path
;
she
be
sufficiently
benevolent
and
obliging
,
but
not
well
teach
nor
well
mannered
;
moreover
,
the
plague
-
spot
of
dissimulation
be
in
her
also
;
honour
and
principle
be
unknown
to
her
,
she
have
scarcely
hear
their
name
.
<EOS>
the
least
exceptionable
pupil
be
the
poor
little
Sylvie
I
have
mention
once
before
.
<EOS>
Sylvie
be
gentle
in
manner
,
intelligent
in
mind
;
she
be
even
sincere
,
as
far
as
her
religion
would
permit
her
to
be
so
,
but
her
physical
organization
be
defective
;
weak
health
stunt
her
growth
and
chill
her
spirit
,
and
then
,
destine
as
she
be
for
the
cloister
,
her
whole
soul
be
warp
to
a
conventual
bias
,
and
in
the
tame
,
train
subjection
of
her
manner
,
one
read
that
she
have
already
prepare
herself
for
her
future
course
of
life
,
by
give
up
her
independence
of
thought
and
action
into
the
hand
of
some
despotic
confessor
.
<EOS>
She
permit
herself
no
original
opinion
,
no
preference
of
companion
or
employment
;
in
everything
she
be
guide
by
another
.
<EOS>
with
a
pale
,
passive
,
automaton
air
,
she
go
about
all
day
long
do
what
she
be
bid
;
never
what
she
like
,
or
what
,
from
innate
conviction
,
she
think
it
right
to
do
.
<EOS>
the
poor
little
future
religieuse
have
be
early
teach
to
make
the
dictate
of
her
own
reason
and
conscience
quite
subordinate
to
the
will
of
her
spiritual
director
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
model
pupil
of
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
's
establishment
;
pale
,
blight
image
,
where
life
linger
feebly
,
but
whence
the

have
be
conjure
by
romish
wizard
-
craft

<EOS>
a
few
english
pupil
there
be
in
this
school
,
and
these
may
be
divide
into
two
class
.
<EOS>
1st
.
<EOS>
the
continental
English
 
<EOS>
the
daughter
chiefly
of
broken
adventurer
,
whom
debt
or
dishonour
have
drive
from
their
own
country
.
<EOS>
these
poor
girl
have
never
know
the
advantage
of
settle
home
,
decorous
example
,
or
honest
protestant
education
;
resident
a
few
month
now
in
one
catholic
school
,
now
in
another
,
as
their
parent
wander
from
land
to
land
 
from
France
to
Germany
,
from
Germany
to
Belgium
 
<EOS>
they
have
pick
up
some
scanty
instruction
,
many
bad
habit
,
lose
every
notion
even
of
the
first
element
of
religion
and
moral
,
and
acquire
an
imbecile
indifference
to
every
sentiment
that
can
elevate
humanity
;
they
be
distinguishable
by
an
habitual
look
of
sullen
dejection
,
the
result
of
crush
self
-
respect
and
constant
browbeating
from
their
popish
fellow
-
pupil
,
who
hate
them
as
English
,
and
scorn
them
as
heretic
.
  
<EOS>
the
second
class
be
British
English
.
<EOS>
of
these
I
do
not
encounter
half
a
dozen
during
the
whole
time
of
my
attendance
at
the
seminary
;
their
characteristic
be
clean
but
careless
dress
,
ill
-
arrange
hair
(
compare
with
the
tight
and
trim
foreigner
)
,
erect
carriage
,
flexible
figure
,
white
and
taper
hand
,
feature
more
irregular
,
but
also
more
intellectual
than
those
of
the
Belgians
,
grave
and
modest
countenance
,
a
general
air
of
native
propriety
and
decency
;
by
this
last
circumstance
alone
I
could
at
a
glance
distinguish
the
daughter
of
Albion
and
nursling
of
Protestantism
from
the
foster
-
child
of
Rome
,
the
PROTEGEE
of
Jesuistry
:
<EOS>
proud
,
too
,
be
the
aspect
of
these
british
girl
;
at
once
envy
and
ridicule
by
their
continental
associate
,
they
ward
off
insult
with
austere
civility
,
and
meet
hate
with
mute
disdain
;
they
eschew
company
-
keeping
,
and
in
the
midst
of
number
seem
to
dwell
isolated
.
  
<EOS>
the
teacher
preside
over
this
mixed
multitude
be
three
in
number
,
all
French
 
their
name
mdlle
.
<EOS>
Zephyrine
,
Pelagie
,
and
Suzette
;
the
two
last
be
commonplace
personage
enough
;
their
look
be
ordinary
,
their
manner
be
ordinary
,
their
temper
be
ordinary
,
their
thought
,
feeling
,
and
view
be
all
ordinary
 
<EOS>
be
I
to
write
a
chapter
on
the
subject
<EOS>
I
could
not
elucidate
it
further
.
<EOS>
Zephyrine
be
somewhat
more
distinguished
in
appearance
and
deportment
than
Pelagie
and
Suzette
,
but
in
character
genuine
parisian
coquette
,
perfidious
,
mercenary
,
and
dry
-
hearted
.
<EOS>
a
fourth
maitresse
I
sometimes
see
who
seem
to
come
daily
to
teach
needlework
,
or

or
some
such
flimsy

but
of
her
<EOS>
I
never
have
more
than
a
pass
glimpse
,
as
she
sit
in
the
CARRE
,
with
her
frame
and
some
dozen
of
the
elder
pupil
about
her
,
consequently
I
have
no
opportunity
of
study
her
character
,
or
even
of
observe
her
person
much
;
the
latter
,
I
remark
,
have
a
very
english
air
for
a
maitresse
,
otherwise
it
be
not
striking
;
of
character
I
should
think
she
possess
but
little
,
as
her
pupil
seem
constantly
"
en
revolte
"
against
her
authority
.
<EOS>
She
do
not
reside
in
the
house
;
her
name
,
I
think
,
be
Mdlle

<EOS>
Henri

<EOS>
amidst
this
assemblage
of
all
that
be
insignificant
and
defective
,
much
that
be
vicious
and
repulsive
(
by
that

epithet
many
would
have
describe
the

,
the
sensible
,
sagacious
,
affable
directress
shone
like
a
steady
star
over
a
marsh
full
of
Jack
-
o'-lanthorns
;
profoundly
aware
of
her
superiority
,
she
derive
an
inward
bliss
from
that
consciousness
which
sustain
her
under
all
the
care
and
responsibility
inseparable
from
her
position
;
it
keep
her
temper
calm
,
<EOS>
her

smooth

her
manner
tranquil

<EOS>
She
like
 
as
who
would
not
?
 
<EOS>
on
enter
the
school
-
room
,
to
feel
that
her
sole
presence
suffice
to
diffuse
that
order
and
quiet
which
all
the
remonstrance
,
and
even
command
,
of
her
underling
frequently
fail
to
enforce
;
she
like
to
stand
in
comparison
,
or
rather
 
<EOS>
contrast
,
with
those
who
surround
her
,
and
to
know
that
in
personal
as
well
as
mental
advantage
,
she
bear
away
the
undisputed
palm
of
preference
 
(
the
three
teacher
be
all
plain
.
)
<EOS>
Her
pupil
she
manage
with
such
indulgence
and
address
,
take
always
on
herself
the
office
of
recompenser
and
eulogist
,
and
abandon
to
her
subaltern
every
invidious
task
of
blame
and
punishment
,
that
they
all
regard
her
with
deference
,
if
not
with
affection
;
her
teacher
do
not
love
her
,
but
they
submit
because
they
be
her
inferior
in
everything
;
the
various
master
who
attend
her
school
be
each
and
all
in
some
way
or
other
under
her
influence
;
over
one
she
have
acquire
power
by
her
skilful
management
of
his
bad
temper
;
over
another
by
little
attention
to
his
petty
caprice
;
a
third
she
have
subdue
by
flattery
;
a
fourth
 
a
timid
man
 
she
keep
in
awe
by
a
sort
of
austere
decision
of
mien
;
me
,
she
still
watch
,
still
try
by
the
most
ingenious
test
 
she
rove
round
me
,
baffle
,
yet
persevere
;
I
believe
she
think
I
be
like
a
smooth
and
bare
precipice
,
which
offer
neither
jut
stone
nor
tree
-
root
,
nor
tuft
of
grass
to
aid
the
climber
.
<EOS>
now
she
flatter
with
exquisite
tact
,
now
she
moralize
,
now
she
try
how
far
I
be
accessible
to
mercenary
motive
,
then
she
disport
on
the
brink
of
affection
 
know
that
some
man
be
win
by
weakness
 
anon
<EOS>
,
she
talk
excellent
sense
,
aware
that
other
have
the
folly
to
admire
judgment
.
<EOS>
I
find
it
at
once
pleasant
and
easy
to
evade
all
these
effort
;
it
be
sweet
,
when
she
think
me
nearly
win
,
to
turn
round
and
to
smile
in
her
very
eye
,
half
scornfully
,
and
then
to
witness
her
scarcely
veil
,
though
mute
mortification
.
<EOS>
still
she
persevere
,
and
at
last
,
I
be
bind
to
confess
it
,
her
finger
,
essaying
,
prove
every
atom
of
the
casket
,
touch
its
secret
spring
,
and
for
a
moment
the
lid
spring
open
<EOS>
;
she
lay
her
hand
on
the
jewel
within
;
whether
she
steal
and
break
it
,
or
whether
the
lid
shut
again
with
a
snap
on
her
finger
,
read
on
,
and
you
shall
know
.
  
<EOS>
It
happen
that
I
come
one
day
to
give
a
lesson
when
I
be
indispose
;
I
have
a
bad
cold
and
a
cough
;
two
hour
'
incessant
talk
leave
me
very
hoarse
and
tired
;
as
I
quit
the
schoolroom
,
and
be
pass
along
the
corridor
,
I
meet
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
<EOS>
;
she
remark
,
with
an
anxious
air
,
that
I
look
very
pale
and
tired
.
"
<EOS>
yes
,
"
I
say
,
"
I
be
fatigue
;
"
and
then
,
with
increase
interest
,
she
rejoin
,
"
You
shall
not
go
away
till
you
have
have
some
refreshment
.
"
<EOS>
She
persuade
me
to
step
into
the
parlour
,
and
be
very
kind
and
gentle
while
I
stay
.
<EOS>
the
next
day
she
be
kind
still
;
she
come
herself
into
the
class
to
see
that
the
window
be
closed
,
and
that
there
be
no
draught
;
she
exhort
me
with
friendly
earnestness
<EOS>
not
to
over
-
exert
myself
;
when
I
go
away
,
she
give
me
her
hand
unasked
,
and
I
could
not
but
mark
,
by
a
respectful
and
gentle
pressure
<EOS>
,
that
I
be
sensible
of
the
favour
,
and
grateful
for
it
.
<EOS>
My
modest
demonstration
kindle
a
little
merry
smile
on
her
countenance
;
I
think
her
almost
charming
.
<EOS>
during
the
remainder
of
the
evening
,
my
mind
be
full
of
impatience
for
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
to
arrive
,
that
I
may
see
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
disappoint
,
for
she
sit
in
the
class
during
the
whole
of
my
subsequent
lesson
,
and
often
look
at
me
almost
with
affection
.
<EOS>
at
four
o'clock
she
accompany
me
out
of
the
schoolroom
,
ask
with
solicitude
after
my
health
,
then
scold
me
sweetly
because
I
speak
too
loud
and
give
myself
too
much
trouble
;
I
stop
at
the
glass
-
door
which
lead
into
the
garden
,
to
hear
her
lecture
to
the
end
;
the
door
be
open
,
it
be
a
very
fine
day
,
and
while
I
listen
to
the
soothe
reprimand
,
I
look
at
the
sunshine
and
flower
,
and
feel
very
happy
.
<EOS>
the
day
-
scholar
begin
to
pour
from
the
schoolroom
into
the
passage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
go
into
the
garden
a
minute
or
two
,
"
ask
she
,
"
till
they
be
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
descend
the
step
without
answer
,
but
I
look
back
as
much
as
to
say
    
<EOS>
"
You
will
come
with
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
in
another
minute
I
and
the
directress
be
walk
side
by
side
down
the
alley
border
with
fruit

tree
,
whose
white
blossom
be

in

as
well
as

<EOS>
the

be
blue
,
the
air
still
,
the
May
afternoon
be
full
of
brightness
and
fragrance
.
<EOS>
release
from
the
stifle
class
,
surround
with
flower
and
foliage
,
with
a
pleasing
,
smile
,
affable
woman
at
my
side
 
<EOS>
how
do
I
feel
?
<EOS>
why
,
very
enviably
.
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
the
romantic
vision
my
imagination
have
suggest
of
this
garden
,
while
it
be
yet
hide
from
me
by
the
jealous
board
,
be
more
than
realize
;
and
,
when
a
turn
in
the
alley
shut
out
the
view
of
the
house
,
and
some
tall
shrub
exclude
M.
Pelet
's
mansion
,
and
screen
us
momentarily
from
the
other
house
,
rise
amphitheatre
-
like
round
this
green
spot
,
I
give
my
arm
to
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
,
and
lead
her
to
a
garden
-
chair
,
nestle
under
some
lilacs
near
.
<EOS>
She
sit
down
;
I
take
my
place
at
her
side
.
<EOS>
She
go
on
talk
to
me
with
that
ease
which
communicate
ease
,
and
,
as
I
listen
,
a
revelation
dawn
in
my
mind
that
I
be
on
the
brink
of
fall
in
love
.
<EOS>
the
dinner
-
bell
rang
,
both
at
her
house
and
M.
Pelet
's
;
we
be
oblige
to
part
;
I
detain
her
a
moment
as
she
be
move
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
something
,
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
what
?
"
ask
Zoraide
naively
.
  
<EOS>
"
only
a
flower
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
gather
it
then
 
or
two
,
or
twenty
,
if
you
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
 
one
will
do
 
but
you
must
gather
it
,
and
give
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
caprice
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaim
,
but
she
raise
herself
on
her
tip
-
toe
,
and
,
pluck
a
beautiful
branch
of
lilac
,
offer
it
to
me
with
grace
.
<EOS>
I
take
it
,
and
go
away
,
satisfied
for
the
present
,
and
hopeful
for
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
certainly
that
May
day
be
a
lovely
one
,
and
it
close
in
moonlight
night
of
summer
warmth
and
serenity
.
<EOS>
I
remember
this
well
;
for
,
have
sit
up
late
that
evening
,
correct
devoir
,
and
feel
weary
and
a
little
oppress
with
the
closeness
of
my
small
room
,
I
open
the
often
-
mention
board
window
,
whose
board
,
however
,
I
have
persuade
old
Madame
Pelet
to
have
remove
since
I
have
fill
the
post
of
professor
in
the
pensionnat
de
demoiselles
,
as
,
from
that
time
,
it
be
no
longer
"
inconvenient
"
for
me
to
overlook
my
own
pupil
at
their
sport
.
<EOS>
I
sit
down
in
the
window
-
seat
,
rest
my
arm
on
the
sill
,
and
lean
out
:
above
me
be
the
clear
-
obscure
of
a
cloudless
night
sky
 
<EOS>
splendid
moonlight
subdue
the
tremulous
sparkle
of
the
star
 
below
lie
the
garden
,
varied
with
silvery
lustre
and
deep
shade
,
and
all
fresh
with
dew
 
<EOS>
a
grateful
perfume
exhale
from
the
close
blossom
of
the
fruit
-
tree
 
not
a
leaf
stir
,
the
night
be
breezeless
.
<EOS>
My
window
look
directly
down
upon
a
certain
walk
of
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
's
garden
,
call
"
l'allee
defendue
,
"
so
name
because
the
pupil
be
forbid
to
enter
it
on
account
of
its
proximity
to
the
boy
'
school
.
<EOS>
It
be
here
that
the
lilacs
and
laburnum
grow
especially
thick
;
this
be
the
most
sheltered
nook
in
the
enclosure
,
its
shrub
screen
the
garden
-
chair
where
that
afternoon
I
have
sit
with
the
young
directress
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
say
that
my
thought
be
chiefly
with
her
as
I
lean
from
the
lattice
,
and
let
my
eye
roam
,
now
over
the
walk
and
border
of
the
garden
,
now
along
the
many
-
windowed
front
of
the
house
which
rise
white
beyond
the
masse
of
foliage
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
in
what
part
of
the
building
be
situate
her
apartment
;
and
a
single
light
,
shine
through
the
persienne
of
one
croisee
,
seem
to
direct
me
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
watch
late
,
"
think
I
,
"
for
it
must
be
now
near
midnight
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
fascinating
little
woman
,
"
I
continue
in
voiceless
soliloquy
;
"
her
image
form
a
pleasant
picture
in
memory
;
I
know
she
be
not
what
the
world
call
pretty
 
no
matter
,
there
be
harmony
in
her
aspect
,
and
I
like
it
;
her
brown
hair
,
her
blue
eye
,
the
freshness
of
her
cheek
,
the
whiteness
of
her
neck
,
<EOS>
all
suit
my
taste
.
<EOS>
then
I
respect
her
talent
;
the
idea
of
marry
a
doll
or
a
fool
be
always
abhorrent
to
me
:
I
know
that
a
pretty
doll
,
a
fair
fool
,
may
do
well
enough
for
the
honeymoon
;
but
when
passion
cool
,
how
dreadful
to
find
a
lump
of
wax
and
wood
lay
in
my
bosom
,
a
half
idiot
clasp
in
my
arm
,
and
to
remember
that
I
have
make
of
this
<EOS>
my
equal
 
nay
,
my
idol
 
to
know
that
I
must
pass
the
rest
of
my
dreary
life
with
a
creature
incapable
of
understand
what
I
say
,
of
appreciate
what
I
think
,
or
of
sympathize
with
what
I
feel
!
"
<EOS>
now
,
Zoraide
Reuter
,
"
think
I
,
"
have
tact
,
CARACTERE
,
judgment
,
discretion
;
have
she
heart
?
<EOS>
what
a
good
,
simple
little
smile
play
about
her
lip
when
she
give
me
the
branch
of
lilacs
!
<EOS>
I
have
think
her
crafty
,
dissembling
,
interested
sometimes
,
it
be
true
;
but
may
not
much
that
look
like
cunning
and
dissimulation
in
her
conduct
be
only
the
effort
make
by
a
bland
temper
to
traverse
quietly
perplex
difficulty
?
<EOS>
and
as
to
interest
,
she
wish
to
make
her
way
in
the
world
,
no
doubt
,
and
who
can
blame
her
?
<EOS>
even
if
she
be
truly
deficient
in
sound
principle
,
be
it
not
rather
her
misfortune
than
her
fault
?
<EOS>
She
have
be
bring
up
a
Catholic
:
have
she
be
bear
an
Englishwoman
,
and
rear
a
Protestant
,
may
she
not
have
add
straight
integrity
to
all
her
other
excellence
?
<EOS>
suppose
she
be
to
marry
an
English
and
protestant
husband
,
would
she
not
,
rational
,
sensible
as
she
be
,
quickly
acknowledge
the
superiority
of
right
over
expediency
,
honesty
over
policy
?
<EOS>
It
would
be
worth
a
man
's
while
to
try
the
experiment
;
to
-
morrow
I
will
renew
my
observation
.
<EOS>
She
know
that
I
watch
her
:
how
calm
she
be
under
scrutiny
!
<EOS>
it
seem
rather
to
gratify
than
annoy
her
.
"
<EOS>
here
a
strain
of
music
stole
in
upon
my
monologue
,
and
suspend
it
;
it
be
a
bugle
,
very
skilfully
play
,
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
park
,
I
think
,
or
on
the
Place
Royale
.
<EOS>
so
sweet
be
the
tone
,
so
subdue
their
effect
at
that
hour
,
in
the
midst
of
silence
and
under
the
quiet
reign
of
moonlight
<EOS>
,
I
cease
to
think
,
that
I
may
listen
more
intently
.
<EOS>
the
strain
retreat
,
its
sound
waxed
fainter
and
be
soon
go
;
my
ear
prepare
to
repose
on
the
absolute
hush
of
midnight
once
more
.
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
what
murmur
be
that
which
,
low
,
and
yet
near
and
approach
nearer
,
frustrate
the
expectation
of
total
silence
?
<EOS>
It
be
some
one
converse
 
<EOS>
yes
,
evidently
,
an
audible
,
though
subdue
voice
speak
in
the
garden
immediately
below
me
.
<EOS>
another
answer
;
the
first
voice
be
that
of
a
man
,
the
second
that
of
a
woman
;
and
a
man
and
a
woman
I
see
come
slowly
down
the
alley
.
<EOS>
Their
form
be
at

at
this
piece
of

(

<EOS>
M.
Pelet
proceed
to
ask
what
she
intend
to
do
with
me
,
intimate
pretty
plainly
,
and
not
very
gallantly
,
that
it
be
nonsense
for
her
to
think
of
take
such
a
"
blanc
-
bec
"
as
a
husband
,
since
she
must
be
at

ten
year
old
than
I
(
be
she
then
thirty
-
two
?
<EOS>
I
should
not
have

it
)
.
<EOS>
I
hear
her
disclaim
any
intention
on
the
subject
 
the
director
,
however
,
still
press
her
to
give
a
definite
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Francois
,
"
say
she
,
"
you
be
jealous
,
"
and
still
she
laugh
;
then
,
as
if
suddenly
recollect
that
this
coquetry
be
not
consistent
with
the
character
for
modest
dignity
she
wish
to
establish
,
she
proceed
,
in
a
demure
voice
:
"
truly
,
my
dear
Francois
,
I
will
not
deny
that
this
young
Englishman

have
make
some
attempt

ingratiate
himself
with
me
;

,
so
far
from
give
him
any
encouragement
,
I
have
always
treat
him
with
as
much
reserve
as
it
be
possible
to
combine
with
civility
;
affiance
as
I
be

I
would
give
no

false
hope

believe
me

"
still
Pelet
uttered
murmur
of
distrust
 
<EOS>
so
I
judge
,
at
least
,
from
her
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
folly
!
<EOS>
how
could
I
prefer
an
unknown
foreigner
to
you
?
<EOS>
and
then
 
not
to
flatter
your
vanity
 
<EOS>
Crimsworth
could
not
bear
comparison
with
you
either
physically
or
mentally
;
he
be
not
a
handsome
man
at
all
;
some
may
call
him
gentleman
-
like
and
intelligent
-
looking
,
but
for
my
part
 
"
  
the
rest
of
the
sentence
be
lose
in
the
distance
,
as
the
pair
,
rise
from
the
chair
in
which
they
have
be
seat
,
move
away
.
<EOS>
I
wait
their
return
,
but
soon
the
opening
and
shutting
of
a
door
inform
me
that
they
have
re
-
enter
the
house
;
I
listen
a
little
longer
,
<EOS>
all
be
perfectly
still
;
I
listen
more
than
an
hour
 
at
last
<EOS>
I
hear
M.
Pelet
come
in
and
ascend
to
his
chamber
.
<EOS>
glance
once
more
towards
the
long
front
of
the
garden

house
,
I
perceive
that
its
solitary
light
be
at
length
extinguish
;
so
,
for
a
time
,
be
my
faith
in
love
and
friendship

<EOS>
I
go
to
bed
,
but
something
feverish
and
fiery
have
get
into
my
vein
which
prevent
me
from
sleep
much
that
night
.
    
<EOS>
NEXT
morning
I
rise
with
the
dawn
,
and
have
dress
myself
and
stand
half
-
an
-
hour
,
my
elbow
lean
on
the
chest
of
drawer
,
consider
what
mean
I
should
adopt
to
restore
my
spirit
,
fag
with
sleeplessness
,
to
their
ordinary
tone
 
<EOS>
for
I
have
no
intention
of
get
up
a
scene
with
M.
Pelet
,
reproach
him
with
perfidy
,
send
him
a
challenge
,
or
perform
other
gambado
of
the
sort
 
I
hit
at
last
on
the
expedient
of
walk
out
in
the
cool
of
the
morning
to
a
neighbour
establishment
of
bath
,
and
treat
myself
to
a
bracing
plunge
.
<EOS>
the
remedy
produce
the
desire
effect
.
<EOS>
I
come
back
at
seven
o'clock
steady
and
invigorate
,
and
be
able
to
greet
M.
Pelet
,
when
he
enter
to
breakfast
,
with
an
unchanged
and
tranquil
countenance
;
even
a
cordial
offering
of
the
hand
and
the
flattering
appellation
of
"
mon
fil
,
"
pronounce
in
that
caress
tone
with
which
Monsieur
have
,
of
late
day
especially
,
be
accustomed
to
address
me
,
do
not
elicit
any
external
sign
of
the
feeling
which
,
though
subdue
,
still
glow
at
my
heart
.
<EOS>
not
that
I
nurse
vengeance
 
<EOS>
no
;
but
the
sense
of
insult
and
treachery
live
in
me
like
a
kindling
,
though
as
yet
smothered
coal
.
<EOS>
God
know
I
be
not
by
nature
vindictive
;
I
would
not
hurt
a
man
because
I
can
no
longer
trust
or
like
him
;
but
neither
my
reason
nor
feeling
be
of
the
vacillating
order
 
<EOS>
they
be
not
of
that
sand
-
like
sort
where
impression
,
if
soon
make
,
be
as
soon
efface
.
<EOS>
once
convinced
that
my
friend
's
disposition
be
incompatible
with
my
own
,
once
assure
that
he
be
indelibly
stain
with
certain
defect
obnoxious
to
my
principle
,
and
I
dissolve
the
connection
.
<EOS>
I
do
so
with
Edward
.
<EOS>
as
to
Pelet
,
the
discovery
be
yet
new
;
should
I
act
thus
with
him
?
<EOS>
It
be
the
question
I
place
before
my
mind
as
I
stir
my
cup
of
coffee
with
a
half
-
pistolet
(
we
never
have
spoon
)
,
Pelet
meantime
be
seat
opposite
,
his
pallid
face
look
as
know
and
more
haggard
than
usual
,
his
blue
eye
turn
,
now
sternly
on
his
boy
and
usher
,
and
now
graciously
on
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
circumstance
must
guide
me
,
"
say
I
;
and
meet
Pelet
's
false
glance
and
insinuate
smile
,
I
thank
heaven
that
I
have
last
night
open
my
window
and
read
by
the
light
of
a
full
moon
the
true
meaning
of
that
guileful
countenance
.
<EOS>
I
feel
half
his
master
,
because
the
reality
of
his
nature
be
now
know
to
me
;
smile
and
flat
as
he
would
,
<EOS>
I
see
his
soul
lurk
behind
his
smile
,
and
hear
in
every
one
of
his
smooth
phrase
a
voice
interpret
their
treacherous
import
.
  
<EOS>
but
Zoraide
Reuter
?
<EOS>
of
course
her
defection
have
cut
me
to
the
quick
?
<EOS>
that
stint
must
have
go
too
deep
for
any
consolation
of
philosophy
to
be
available
in
cure
its
smart
?
<EOS>
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
the
night
fever
over
,
I
look
about
for
balm
to
that
wound
also
,
and
find
some
nearer
home
than
at
Gilead
.
<EOS>
reason
be
my
physician
;
she
begin
by
prove
that
the
prize
I
have
miss
be
of
little
value
:
she
admit
that
,
physically
,
Zoraide
may
have
suit
me
,
but
affirm
that
our
soul
be
not
in
harmony
,
and
that
discord
must
have
result
from
the
union
of
her
mind
with
mine
.
<EOS>
She
then
insist
on
the
suppression
of
all
repine
,
and
command
me
rather
to
rejoice
that
I
have
escape
a
snare
.
<EOS>
Her
medicament
do
me
good
.
<EOS>
I
feel
its
strengthen
effect
when
I
meet
the
directress
the
next
day
;
its
stringent
operation
on
the
nerve
suffer
no
tremble
,
no
faltering
;
it
enable
me
to
face
her
with
firmness
,
to
pass
her
with
ease
.
<EOS>
She
have
hold
out
her
hand
to
me
 
that
I
do
not
choose
to
see
.
<EOS>
She
have
greet
me
with
a
charming
smile
 
<EOS>
it
fall
on
my
heart
like
light
on
stone
.
<EOS>
I
pass
on
to
the
estrade
,
she
follow
me
;
her
eye
,
fasten
on
my
face
,
demand
of
every
feature
the
meaning
of
my
changed
and
careless
manner
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
give
her
an
answer
,
"
think
I
;
and
,
meet
her
gaze
full
,
arrest
,
fix
her
glance
,
I
shoot
into
her
eye
,
from
my
own
,
a
look
,
where
there
be
no
respect
,
no
love
,
no
tenderness
,
no
gallantry
;
where
the
strict
analysis
could
detect
nothing
but
scorn
,
hardihood
,
irony
.
<EOS>
I
make
her
bear
it
,
and
feel
it
;
her
steady
countenance
do
not
change
,
but
her
colour
rise
,
and
she
approach
me
as
if
fascinate
.
<EOS>
She
step
on
to
the
estrade
,
and
stand
close
by
my
side
;
she
have
nothing
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
relieve
her
embarrassment
,
and
negligently
turn
over
the
leave
of
a
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
feel
quite
recover
to
-
day
,
"
at
last
she
say
,
in
a
low
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
,
mademoiselle
,
hope
that
you
take
no
cold
last
night
in
consequence
of
your
late
walk
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
quick
enough
of
comprehension
,
she
understand
me
directly
;
her
face
become
a
little
blanch
 
a
very
little
 
<EOS>
but
no
muscle
in
her
rather
marked
feature
move
;
and
,
calm
and
self
-
possess
,
she
retire
from
the
estrade
,
take
her
seat
quietly
at
a
little
distance
,
and
occupy
herself
with
net
a
purse
.
<EOS>
I
proceed
to
give
my
lesson
;
it
be
a
"
Composition
,
"
<EOS>
i.e.
,
I
dictate
certain
general
question
,
of
which
the
pupil
be
to
compose
the
answer
from
memory
,
access
to
book
be
forbid

<EOS>
while
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Eulalie
,
Hortense
,
Caroline
,
&
c.
,
be
ponder
over
the
string
of
rather
abstruse
grammatical
interrogatory
I
have
propound
,
I
be
at
liberty
to
employ
the
vacant
half
hour
in
further
observe
the
directress
herself
.
<EOS>
the
green
silk
purse
be
progress
fast
in
her
hand
;
her
eye
be
bent
upon
it
;
her
attitude
,
as
she
sit
net
within
two
yard
of
me
,
be
still
yet
guard
;
in
her
whole
person
be
express
at
once
,
and
with
equal
clearness
,
vigilance
and
repose
 
<EOS>
a
rare
union
!
<EOS>
look
at
her
,
I
be
force
,
as
I
have
often
be
before
,
to
offer
her
good
sense
,
her
wondrous
self
-
control
,
the
tribute
of
involuntary
admiration
.
<EOS>
She
have
feel
that
I
have
withdraw
from
her
my
esteem
;
she
have
see
contempt
and
coldness
in
my
eye
,
and
to
her
,
who
covet
the
approbation
of
all
around
her
,
who
thirst
after
universal
good
opinion
,
such
discovery
must
have
be
an
acute
wound
.
<EOS>
I
have
witness
its
effect
in
the
momentary
pallor
of
her
cheek
 
cheek
unused
to
vary
;
yet
how
quickly
,
by
dint
of
self
-
control
,
have
she
recover
her
composure
!
<EOS>
with
what
quiet
dignity
she
now
sit
,
almost
at
my
side
,
sustain
by
her
sound
and
vigorous
sense
;
no
tremble
in
her
somewhat
lengthen
,
though
shrewd
upper
lip
,
no
coward
shame
on
her
austere
forehead
!
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
metal
there
,
"
I
say
,
as
I
gaze
.
"
<EOS>
Would
that
there
be
fire
also
,
live
ardour
to
make
the
steel
glow
 
<EOS>
then
I
could
love
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
presently
I
discover
that
she
know
I
be
watch
her
,
for
she
stir
<EOS>
not
,
she
lift
not
her
crafty
eyelid
;
she
have
glance
down
from
her
net
to
her
small
foot
,
peep
from
the
soft
fold
of
her
purple
merino
gown
;
thence
her
eye
revert
to
her
hand
,
ivory
white
,
with
a
bright
garnet
ring
on
the
forefinger
,
and
a
light
frill
of
lace
round
the
wrist
;
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
movement
she
turn
her
head
,
cause
her
nut
-
brown
curl
to
wave
gracefully
.
<EOS>
in
these
slight
sign
I
read
that
the
wish
of
her
heart
,
the
design
of
her
brain
,
be
to
lure
back
the
game
she
have
scare

a
little
incident
give
her
the

me
again

Monsieur

that
young

have
just
enter

wish
to
have
the
advantage
of
take
lesson
with
you
in
English

she
be
not
a
pupil

she
be
,
indeed
,
in
one
sense

a
teacher

for
she
give
instruction
in
lace

mending
,
and
in
little
variety
of
ornamental
needle
-
work

<EOS>
She
very
properly
propose
to
qualify
herself
for
a
high
department

education

have
ask
permission
to
attend
your
lesson

to
perfect
her
knowledge

in
which
language
she
have

I
believe

already
make
some
progress

of
course
it
be
my
wish

aid
her

an
effort
so
praiseworthy

you

Henri
have
not
receive
a
regular

perhaps
her
natural
talent
be
not
of

high
order

but
I
can
assure
you
of
the
excellence
of
her
intention

and
even
of
the
amiability
of
her
disposition

<EOS>
Monsieur
will
then
,
I
be
sure
,
have
the
goodness
to
be
considerate
with
her
at
first

and
not
expose
her
backwardness
,
her
inevitable
deficiency

before
the
young

who
,
in
a
sense

be
her
pupil

Will
Monsieur
Creemsvort
favour
me
by
attend
to
this
hint

I
nod

<EOS>
She
continue
with
subdue
earnestness
    
"
pardon
me
,
monsieur
,
if
I
venture
to
add
that
what
I
have
just
say
be
of
importance
to
the
poor
girl

she
already
experience
great
difficulty
in
impress
these
giddy
young

a
due
degree
of
deference

should
that
difficulty

increase
by
new
discovery
of
her
incapacity

she
may
find
her
position
in
my

too
painful

a
circumstance
I
should
much
regret
for
her

ill

<EOS>

<EOS>
Reuter
possess
marvellous
tact
;
but
tact
<EOS>
the
most
exclusive
,
unsupported
by
sincerity
,
will
sometimes
fail
of
its
effect
;
thus
,
on
this
occasion
,
the
longer
she
preach
about
the
necessity
of
be
indulgent
to
the
governess
pupil
,
the
more
impatient
I
feel
as
I
listen
.
<EOS>
I
discern
so
clearly
that
while
her
professed
motive
be
a
wish
to
aid
the
dull
,
though
well
-
mean
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Henri
,
her
real
one
be
no
other
than
a
design
to
impress
me
with
an
idea
of
her
own
exalt
goodness
and
tender
considerateness
;
so
have
again
hastily
nodded
assent
to
her
remark
,
I
obviate
their
renewal
by
suddenly
demand
the
composition
,
in
a
sharp
accent
,
and
step
from
the
estrade
,
I
proceed
to
collect
them
.
<EOS>
as
I
pass
the
governess
-
pupil
,
I
say
to
her
    
"
<EOS>
You
have
come
in
too
late
to
receive
a
lesson
to

day
;
try
to
be
more
punctual
next
time

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
behind
her
,
and
could
not
read
in
her
face
the
effect
of
my
not
very
civil
speech
.
<EOS>
probably
I
should
not
have
trouble
myself
to
do
so
,
have
I
be
full
in
front
;
but
I
observe
that
she
immediately
begin
to
slip
her
book
into
her
caba
again
;
and
,
presently
,
after
I
have
return
to
the
estrade
,
while
I
be
arrange
the
mass
of
composition
<EOS>
,
I
hear
the
fold
-
door
again
open
and
close
;
and
,
on
look
up
,
I
perceive
her
place
vacant
.
<EOS>
I
think
to
myself
,
"
She
will
consider
her
first
attempt
at
take
a
lesson
in
English
something
of
a
failure
;
"
and
I
wonder
whether
she
have
depart
in
the
sulk
,
or
whether
stupidity
have
induce
her
to
take
my
word
too
literally
,
or
,
finally
,
whether
my
irritable
tone
have
wound
her
feeling
.
<EOS>
the
last
notion
I
dismiss
almost
as
soon
as
I
have
conceive
it
,
for
not
have
see
any
appearance
of
sensitiveness
in
any
human
face
since
my
arrival
in
Belgium
,
I
have
begin
to
regard
it
almost
as
a
fabulous
quality
.
<EOS>
whether
her
physiognomy
announce
it
<EOS>
I
could
not
tell
,
for
her
speedy
exit
have
allow
me
no
time
to
ascertain
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
indeed
,
on
two
or
three
previous
occasion
,
catch
a
passing
view
of
her
(
as
I
believe
have
be
mention
before
)
;
but
I
have
never
stop
to
scrutinize
either
her
face
or
person
,
and
have
<EOS>
but
the
most
vague
idea
of
her
general
appearance
.
<EOS>
just
as
I
have
finish
roll
up
the
composition
,
the
four
o'clock
bell
rang
;
with
my
accustomed
alertness
in
obey
that
signal
,
I
grasp
my
hat
and
evacuate
the
premise
.
    
<EOS>
if
I
be
punctual
in
quit
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
's
domicile
,
I
be
at
least
equally
punctual
in
arrive
there
;
I
come
the
next
day
at
five
minute
before
two
,
and
on
reach
the
schoolroom
door
,
before
I
open
it
,
I
hear
a
rapid
,
gabble
sound
,
which
warn
me
that
the
"

be
not
yet

<EOS>
I
wait
the
termination
thereof

it
would
have
be
impious
to
intrude
my
heretical
presence
during
its
progress

<EOS>
how

cackle

an
invocation

then
down
they
all
sit

the
solemn

fling

utter
pert

that

It

with
compliment

to
heighten

a

<EOS>
she
suit

the

admire
the

<EOS>
she
be
of

the
toil

fag
,
probably
irritable

,
blind
almost
to
beauty
,
insensible
to
air

glory
chiefly
in
certain
mental
quality

application

love
of
knowledge

natural
capacity

docility
,
truthfulness
,
gratefulness
,
be
the
charm
that
attract
his
notice
and
win
his
regard

<EOS>
these
he
seek
,
but
seldom
meet
;
these
,
if
by
chance
he
find
,
he
would
fain
retain
for
ever

and
when
separation
deprive
him
of
them
he
feel
as

some
ruthless

<EOS>
such
be
the
case

agree

My
first
business
this
afternoon
consist
in
read
the
list
of
place
for
the
month
,
determine
by
the
relative
correctness
of
the
composition
give
the
precede
day
.
<EOS>
the
list
be
head
,
as
usual
,
by
the
name
of
Sylvie
,
that
plain
,
quiet
little
girl
I
have
describe
before
as
be
at
once
the
good
and
ugliest
pupil
in
the
establishment
;
the
second
place
have
fall
to
the
lot
of
a
certain
Leonie
Ledru
,
a
diminutive
,
sharp
-
featured
,
and
parchment
-
skinned
creature
of
quick
wit
,
frail
conscience
,
and
indurate
feeling
;
a
lawyer
-
like
thing
,
of
whom
I
use
to
say
that
,
have
she
be
a
boy
,
she
would
have
make
a
model
of
an
unprincipled
,
clever
attorney
.
<EOS>
then
come
Eulalie
,
the
proud
beauty
,
the
Juno
of
the
school
,
whom
six
long
year
of
drill
in
the
simple
grammar
of
the
english
language
have
compel
,
despite
the
stiff
phlegm
of
her
intellect
,
to
acquire
a
mechanical
acquaintance
with
most
of
its
rule
.
<EOS>
no
smile
,
no
trace
of
pleasure
or
satisfaction
appear
in
Sylvie
's
nun
-
like
and
passive
face
as
she
hear
her
name
read
first
.
<EOS>
I
always
feel
sadden
by
the
sight
of
that
poor
girl
's
absolute
quiescence
on
all
occasion
,
and
it
be
my
custom
to
look
at
her
,
to
address
her
,
as
seldom
as
possible
;
her
extreme
docility
,
her
assiduous
perseverance
,
would
have
recommend
her
warmly
to
my
good
opinion
;
her
modesty
,
her
intelligence
,
would
have
induce
me
to
feel
most
kindly
 
most
affectionately
towards
her
,
notwithstanding
the
almost
ghastly
plainness
of
her
feature
,
the
disproportion
of
her
form
,
the
corpse
-
like
lack
of
animation
in
her
countenance
,
have
I
not
be
aware
that
every
friendly
word
,
every
kindly
action
,
would
be
report
by
her
to
her
confessor
,
and
by
him
misinterpret
and
poison
.
<EOS>
once
I
lay
my
hand
on
her
head
,
in
token
of
approbation
;
I
think
Sylvie
be
go
to
smile
,
her
dim
eye
almost
kindle
;
but
,
presently
,
she
shrink
from
me
;
I
be
a
man
and
a
heretic
;
<EOS>
she
,
poor
child
!
<EOS>
a
destine
nun
and
devoted
Catholic
:
thus
a
four
-
fold
wall
of
separation
divide
her
mind
from
mine

<EOS>
a
pert
smirk
,
and
a
hard

Eulalie

sullen
and
envious
 
<EOS>
she
have
hope
to
be
first

<EOS>
Hortense
and
Caroline
exchange
a
reckless
grimace
on
hear
their
name
read
out
somewhere
near
the
bottom
of
the
list
;
the
brand
of
mental
inferiority
be
consider
by
them
as
no
disgrace
,
their
hope
for
the
future
be
base
solely
on
their
personal
attraction
.
  
<EOS>
this
affair
arrange
,
the
regular
lesson
follow
.
<EOS>
during
a
brief
interval
,
employ
by
the
pupil
in
rule
their
book
,
my
eye
,
range
carelessly
over
the
bench
,
observe
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
the
farth
seat
in
the
farth
row
 
a
seat
usually
vacant
 
be
again
fill
by
the
new
scholar
,
the
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
henri
so
ostentatiously
recommend
to
me
by
the
directress
.
<EOS>
to
-
day
I
have
on
my
spectacle
;
her
appearance
,
therefore
,
be
clear
to
me
at
the
first
glance
;
I
have
not
to
puzzle
over
it
.
<EOS>
She
look
young
;
yet
,
have
I
be
require
to
name
her
exact
age
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
be
somewhat
nonplus
;
the
slightness
of
her
figure
may
have
suit
seventeen
;
a
certain
anxious
and
pre
-
occupied
expression
of
face
seem
the
indication
of
riper
year
.
<EOS>
She
be
dress
,
like
all
the
rest
,
in
a
dark
stuff
gown
and
a
white
collar
;
her
feature
be
dissimilar
to
any
there
,
not
so
rounded
,
more
defined
,
yet
scarcely
regular
.
<EOS>
the
shape
of
her
head
too
be
different
,
the
superior
part
more
developed
,
the
base
considerably
less
.
<EOS>
I
feel
assure
,
at
first
sight
,
that
she
be
not
a
belgian
;
her
complexion
,
her
countenance
,
her
lineament
,
her
figure
,
be
all
distinct
from
theirs
,
and
,
evidently
,
the
type
of
another
race
 
of
a
race
less
gifted
with
fullness
of
flesh
and
plenitude
of
blood
;
less
jocund
,
material
,
unthinking
.
<EOS>
when
I
first
cast
my
eye
on
her
,
she
sit
look
fixedly
down
,
<EOS>
her
chin
rest
on
her
hand
,
and
she
do
not
change
her
attitude
till
I
commence
the
lesson
.
<EOS>
none
of
the
belgian
girl
would
have
retain
one
position
,
and
that
a
reflective
one
,
for
the
same
length
of
time
.
<EOS>
yet
,
have
intimate
that
her
appearance
be
peculiar
,
as
be
unlike
that
of
her
flemish
companion
,
I
have
little
more
to
say
respect
it
;
I
can
pronounce
no
encomium
on
her
beauty
,
for
she
be
not
beautiful
;
nor
offer
condolence
on
her
plainness
,
for
neither
<EOS>
be
she
plain
;
a
careworn
character
of
forehead
,
and
a
corresponding
moulding
of
the
mouth
,
strike
me
with
a
sentiment
resemble
surprise
,
but
these
trait
would
probably
have
pass
unnoticed
by
any
less
crotchety
observer
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
reader
,
though
I
have
spend
more
than
a
page
in
describe
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Henri
,
I
know
well
enough
that
I
have
leave
on
your
mind
's
eye
no
distinct
picture
of
her
;
I
have
not
paint
her
complexion
,
nor
her
eye
,
nor
her
hair
,
nor
even
draw
the
outline
of
her
shape
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
tell
whether
her
nose
be
aquiline
or
retrousse
,
whether
her
chin
be
long
or
short
,
her
face
square
or
oval
;
nor
could
I
the
first
day
,
and
it
be
not
my
intention
to
communicate
to
you
at
once
a
knowledge
I
myself
gain
by
little
and
little
.
  
<EOS>
I
give
a
short
exercise
:
which
they
all
write
down
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
new
pupil
be
puzzle
at
first
with
the
novelty
of
the
form
and
language
;
once
or
twice
she
look
at
me
with
a
sort
of
painful
solicitude
,
as
not
comprehend
at
all
what
I
mean
;
then
she
be
not
ready
when
the
other
be
,
she
could
not
write
her
phrase
so
fast
as
they
do
;
I
would
not
help
her
,
I
go
on
relentless
.
<EOS>
She
look
at
me
;
her
eye
say
most
plainly
,
"
I
can
not
follow
you
.
<EOS>
"
I
disregard
the
appeal
,
and
,
carelessly
lean
back
in
my
chair
,
glance
from
time
to
time
with
a
NONCHALANT
air
out
of
the
window
,
I
dictate
a
little
faster
.
<EOS>
on
look
towards
her
again
,
I
perceive
her
face
cloud
with
embarrassment
,
but
she
be
still
write
on
most
diligently
;
I
pause
a
few
second
;
she
employ
the
interval
in
hurriedly
re
-
peruse
what
she
have
write
,
and
shame
and
discomfiture
be
apparent
in
her
countenance
;
she
evidently
find
she
have
make
great
nonsense
of
it
.
<EOS>
in
ten
minute
more
the
dictation
be
complete
,
and
,
have
allow
a
brief
space
in
which
to
correct
it
,
I
take
their
book
;
it
be
with
a
reluctant
hand
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Henri
give
up
her
,
but
,
have
once
yield
it
to
my
possession
,
she
compose
her
anxious
face
,
as
if
,
for
the
present
she
have
resolve
to
dismiss
regret
,
and
have
make
up
her
mind
to
be
think
unprecedentedly
stupid
.
<EOS>
glance
over
her
exercise
,
I
find
that
several
line
have
be
omit
,
but
what
be
write
contain
very
few
fault
;
I
instantly
inscribe
"
bon
"
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
,
and
return
it
to
her
;
she
smile
,
at
first
incredulously
,
then
as
if
reassure
,
but
do
not
lift
her
eye
;
she
could
look
at
me
,
it
seem
,
when
perplex
and
bewilder
,
but
not
when
gratified
;
I
think
that
scarcely
fair
.
    
<EOS>
some
time
elapse
before
I
again
give
a
lesson
in
the
first
class
;
the
holiday
of
Whitsuntide
occupy
three
day
,
and
on
the
fourth
it
be
the
turn
of
the
second
division
to
receive
my
instruction
.
<EOS>
as
I
make
the
transit
of
the
CARRE
,
I
observe
,
as
usual
,
the
band
of
sewer
surround
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
henri
;
there
be
only
about
a
dozen
of
them
,
but
they
make
as
much
noise
as
may
have
suffice
for
fifty
;
they
seem
very
little
under
her
control
;
three
or
four
at
once
assail
her
with
importunate
requirement
;
she
look
harass
,
she
demand
silence
,
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
She
see
me
,
and
I
read
in
her
eye
pain
that
a
stranger
should
witness
the
insubordination
of
her
pupil
;
she
seem
to
entreat
order
 
<EOS>
her
prayer
be
useless
;
then
I
remark
that
she
compress
her
lip
and
contract
her
brow
;
and
her
countenance
,
if
I
read
it
correctly
,
say
 
"
I
have
do
my
good
;
I
seem
to
merit
blame
notwithstanding
;
blame
me
then
who
will
.
<EOS>
"
I
pass
on
;
as
I
close
the
school
-
room
door
,
I
hear
her
say
,
suddenly
and
sharply
,
address
one
of
the
eld
and
most
turbulent
of
the
lot
    
"
Amelie
Mullenberg
,
ask
me
no
question
,
and
request
of
me
no
assistance
,
for
a
week
to
come
;
during
that
space
of
time
I
will
neither
speak
to
you
nor
help
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
word
be
utter
with
emphasis
 
<EOS>
nay
,
with
vehemence
 
and
a
comparative
silence
follow
;
whether
the
calm
be
permanent
,
I
know
not
;
two
door
now
close
between
me
and
the
CARRE
.
  
<EOS>
next
day
be
appropriate
to
the
first
class
;
on
my
arrival
,
I
find
the
directress
seat
,
as
usual
,
in
a
chair
between
the
two
estrade
,
and
before
her
be
stand
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Henri
,
in
an
attitude
(
as
it
seem
to
me
)
of
somewhat
reluctant
attention
.
<EOS>
the
directress
be
knit
and
talk
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
amidst
the
hum
of
a
large
school
-
room
,
it
be
easy
so
to
speak
in
the
ear
of
one
person
,
as
to
be
hear
by
that
person
alone
,
and
it
be
thus
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
parley
with
her
teacher
.
<EOS>
the
face
of
the
latter
be
a
little
flushed
,
not
a
little
troubled
;
there
be
vexation
in
it
,
<EOS>
whence
result
I
know
not
,
for
the
directress
look
very
placid
indeed
;
she
could
not
be
scold
in
such
gentle
whisper
,
and
with
so
equable
a
mien
;
no
,
it
be
presently
prove
that
her
discourse
have
be
of
the
most
friendly
tendency
,
for
I
hear
the
closing
word
    
"
C'est
assez
,
ma
bonne
amie
;
a
present
je
ne
veux
pas
vous
retenir
davantage
.
"
  
<EOS>
without
reply
,
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Henri
turn
away
;
dissatisfaction
be
plainly
evince
in
her
face
,
and
a
smile
,
slight
and
brief
,
but
bitter
,
distrustful
,
and
,
<EOS>
I
think
,
scornful
,
curl
her
lip
as
she
take
her
place
in
the
class
;
it
be
a
secret
,
involuntary
smile
,
which
last
but
a
second
;
an
air
of
depression
succeed
,
chase
away
presently
by
one
of
attention
and
interest
,
when
I
give
the
word
for
all
the
pupil
to
take
their
reading
-
book
.
<EOS>
in
general
I
hate
the
reading
-
lesson
,
it
be
such
a
torture
to
the
ear
to
listen
to
their
uncouth
mouthing
of
my
native
tongue
,
and
no
effort
of
example
or
precept
on
my
part
ever
seem
to
effect
the
slight
improvement
in
their
accent
.
<EOS>
to
-
day
,
each
in
her
appropriate
key
,
lisp
,
stutter
,
mumble
,
and
jabber
as
usual
;
about
fifteen
have
rack
me
in
turn
,
and
my
auricular
nerve
be
expect
with
resignation
the
discord
of
the
sixteenth
,
when
a
full
,
though
low
voice
,
read
out
,
in
clear
correct
English
.
  
<EOS>
"
on
his
way
to
Perth
,
the
king
be
meet
by
a
Highland
woman
,
call
herself
a
prophetess
;
she
stand
at
the
side
of
the
ferry
by
which
he
be
about
to
travel
to
the
north
,
and
cry
with
a
loud
voice
,
"
My
lord

if

this
water
you

never

(
VIDE
the
history
of
SCOTLAND
)
.
  
<EOS>
I
look
up
in
amazement
;
the
voice
be
a
voice
of
Albion
;
the
accent
be
pure
and
silvery
;
it
only
want
firmness
,
and
assurance
,
to
be
the
counterpart
of
what
any
well
-
educate
lady
in
Essex
or
Middlesex
may
have
enounce
,
yet
the
speaker
or
reader
be
no
other
than
Mdlle

<EOS>
Henri
,
in
whose
grave
,
joyless
face
<EOS>
I
see
no
mark
of
consciousness
that
she
have
perform
any
extraordinary
feat
.
<EOS>
no
one
else
evince
surprise
either
.
<EOS>
Mdlle

<EOS>
Reuter
knit
away
assiduously
;
I
be
aware
,
however
,
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
paragraph
,
she
have
lift
her
eyelid
and
honour
me
with
a
glance
sideway
;
she
do
not
know
the
full
excellency
of
the
teacher
's
style
of
reading
,
but
she
perceive
that
her
accent
be
not
that
of
the
other
,
and
want
to
discover
what
I
think
;
I
mask
my
visage
with
indifference
,
and
order
the
next
girl
to
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
lesson
be
over
,
I
take
advantage
of
the
confusion
cause
by
break
up
,
to
approach
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
henri
;
she
be
stand
near
the
window
and
retire
as
I
advance
;
she
think
I
want
to
look
out
,
and
do
not
imagine
that
I
could
have
anything
to
say
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
take
her
exercise
-
book
out
of
her
hand
;
as
I
turn
over
the
leave
<EOS>
I
address
her
:
    
<EOS>
"
You
have
have
lesson
in
English
before
?

"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
no

"
no

you
read
it
well

<EOS>
"
oh

with
some
animation
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
be

english
family

<EOS>
still
the
answer
be

no

here
my

rest

I
ask
  
"
yes

sir

"
  
<EOS>
My
interrogation
be
cut
short
;
I
hear
a
little
rustle
behind
me
,
and
close
at
my
back
<EOS>
be
the
directress
,
profess
to
be
examine
the
interior
of
a
desk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle

say
she
,
look
up
and

<EOS>
"
what
splendid

observe
the

cheerfully
,
glance
at
the

time
from
the
window
.
<EOS>
I
assent
and
be
withdraw
.
<EOS>
"
what
of
your

continue
she
,
follow
my

<EOS>
be
she
likely
to
make
progress

English

"
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
I
can
hardly
judge
.
<EOS>
She
possess
a
pretty
good
accent
;
of
her
real
knowledge
of
the
language
I
have
as
yet
have
no
opportunity
of
form
an
opinion

"
<EOS>
and
her
natural
capacity

monsieur

<EOS>
I
have
have
my
fear
about
that
:
can
you
relieve
me
by
an
assurance
at
least
of
its
average
power
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
no
reason
to
doubt
its
average
power
,
mademoiselle
,
but
really
I
scarcely
know
her
,
and
have
not
have
time
to
study
the
calibre
of
her
capacity

I
wish
you
a
very
good
afternoon

She
still
pursue
me
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
observe
,
monsieur
,
and
tell
me
what
you
think
;
I
could
so
much
better
rely
on
your
opinion
than
on
my
own
;
woman
can
not
judge
of
these
thing
as
man
can
,
and
,
excuse
my
pertinacity
,
monsieur
,
but
it
be
natural
<EOS>
I
should
feel
interested
about
this
poor
little
girl
(
pauvre
petite

;
she
have
scarcely
any
relation
,
her
own
effort
be
all
she
have
to
look
to
,
her
acquirement
must
be
her
sole
fortune

her
present
position
have
once
be
mine

or
nearly
so
;
it
be
then

natural
I
should
sympathize
with
her
;
and
sometimes
when
I
see
the
difficulty
she
have
in
manage
pupil

I
feel
quite
chagrined

<EOS>
I
doubt
not
she
do
her
good
,
her
intention
be
excellent
;
but
,
monsieur
,
she
want
tact
and
firmness
.
<EOS>
I
have
talk
to
her
on
the
subject
,
but
I
be
not
fluent
,
and
probably
do
not
express
myself
with
clearness
;
she
never
appear
to
comprehend
me
.
<EOS>
now
,
would
you
occasionally
,
when
you
see
an
opportunity
,
slip
in
a
word
of
advice
to
her
on
the
subject
;
man
have
so
much
more
influence
than
woman
have
 
they
argue
so
much
more
logically
than
we
do
;
and
you
,
monsieur
,
in
particular
,
have
so
paramount
a
power
of
make
yourself
obey
;
a
word
of
advice
from
you
<EOS>
could
not
but
do
her
good
;
even
if
she
be
sullen
and
headstrong
(
which
I
hope
she
be
not
)
,
she
would
scarcely
refuse
to
listen
to
you
<EOS>
;
for
my
own
part
,
I
can
truly
say
that
I
never
attend
one
of
your
lesson
without
derive
benefit
from
witness
your
management
of
the
pupil
.
<EOS>
the
other
master
be
a
constant
source
of
anxiety
to
me
;
they
can
not
impress
the
young
lady
with
sentiment
of
respect
,
nor
restrain
the
levity
natural
to
youth
:
in
you
,
monsieur
,
I
feel
the
most
absolute
confidence
;
try
then
to
put
this
poor
child
into
the
way
of
control
our
giddy
,
high
-
spirited
Brabantoises
.
<EOS>
but
,
monsieur
,
I
would
add
one
word
more
;
do
not
alarm
her
AMOUR
PROPRE
;
beware
of
inflict
a
wound
there
.
<EOS>
I
reluctantly
admit
that
in
that
particular
she
be
blameably
 
some
would
say
ridiculously
 
susceptible
.
<EOS>
I
fear
I
have
touch
this
sore
point
inadvertently
,
and
she
can
not
get
over
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
during
the
great
part
of
this
harangue
my
hand
be
on
the
lock
of
the
outer
door
;
I
now
turn
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Au
revoir
,
mademoiselle
,
"
say
I
,
and
I
escape
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
directress
's
stock
of
word
be
yet
far
from
exhausted
.
<EOS>
She
look
after
me
,
she
would
fain
have
detain
me
longer
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
towards
me
have
be
alter
ever
since
I
have
begin
to
treat
her
with
hardness
and
indifference
:
she
almost
cringe
to
me
on
every
occasion
;
she
consult
my
countenance
incessantly
,
and
beset
me
with
innumerable
little
officious
attention
.
<EOS>
servility
create
despotism
.
<EOS>
this
slavish
homage
,
instead
of
soften
my
heart
,
only
pamper
whatever
be
stern
and
exact
in
its
mood
.
<EOS>
the
very
circumstance
of
her
hovering
round
me
like
a
fascinated
bird
,
seem
to
transform
me
into
a
rigid
pillar
of
stone
;
her
flattery
irritate
my
scorn
,
her
blandishment
confirm
my
reserve
.
<EOS>
at
time
I
wonder
what
she
mean
by
give
herself
such
trouble
to
win
me
,
when
the
more
profitable
Pelet
be
already
in
her
net
,
and
when
,
too
,
she
be
aware
that
I
possess
her
secret
,
for
I
have
not
scruple
to
tell
her
as
much
:
<EOS>
but
the
fact
be
that
as
it
be
her
nature
to
doubt
the
reality
and
under
-
value
the
worth
of
modesty
,
affection
,
disinterestedness
 
to
regard
these
quality
as
foible
of
character
 
<EOS>
so
it
be
equally
her
tendency
to
consider
pride
,
hardness
,
selfishness
,
as
proof
of
strength
.
<EOS>
She
would
trample
on
the
neck
of
humility
,
she
would
kneel
at
the
foot
of
disdain
;
she
would
meet
tenderness
with
secret
contempt
,
indifference
she
would
woo
with
ceaseless
assiduity
.
<EOS>
benevolence
,
devotedness
,
enthusiasm
,
be
her
antipathy
;
for
dissimulation
and
self
-
interest
<EOS>
she
have
a
preference
 
<EOS>
they
be
real
wisdom
in
her
eye
;
moral
and
physical
degradation
,
mental
and
bodily
inferiority
,
she
regard
with
indulgence
;
they
be
foil
capable
of
be
turn
to
good
account
as
set
-
off
for
her
own
endowment
.
<EOS>
to
violence
,
injustice
,
tyranny
,
she
succumb
 
<EOS>
they
be
her
natural
master
;
she
have
no
propensity
to
hate
,
no
impulse
to
resist
them
;
the
indignation
their
behest
awake
in
some
heart
be
unknown
in
hers
.
<EOS>
from
all
this
it
result
that
the
false
and
selfish
call
her
wise
,
the
vulgar
and
debase
term
her
charitable
,
<EOS>
the
insolent
and
unjust
dub
her
amiable
,
the
conscientious
and
benevolent
generally
at
first
accept
as
valid
her
claim
to
be
consider
one
of
themselves
;
but
ere
long
the
plating
of
pretension
wear
off
,
the
real
material
appear
below
,
and
they
lay
her
aside
as
a
deception
.
    
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
another
fortnight
I
have
see
sufficient
of
Frances
Evans
Henri
,
to
enable
me
to
form
a
more
definite
opinion
of
her
character
.
<EOS>
I
find
her
possess
in
a
somewhat
remarkable
degree
of
at
least
two
good
point
,
viz
.
,
perseverance
and
a
sense
of
duty
;
I
find
she
be
really
capable
of
apply
to
study
,
of
contend
with
difficulty
.
<EOS>
at
first
I
offer
her
the
same
help
which
I
have
always
find
it
necessary
to
confer
on
the
other
;
I
begin
with
unloose
for
her
each
knotty
point
,
but
I
soon
discover
that
such
help
be
regard
by
my
new
pupil
as
degrade
;
she
recoil
from
it
with
a
certain
proud
impatience
.
<EOS>
Hereupon
I
appoint
her
long
lesson
,
and
leave
her
to
solve
alone
any
perplexity
they
may
present
.
<EOS>
She
set
to
the
task
with
serious
ardour
,
and
have
quickly
accomplish
one
labour
,
eagerly
demand
more
.
<EOS>
so
much
for
her
perseverance
;
as
to
her
sense
of
duty
,
it
evince
itself
thus
:
<EOS>
she
like
to
learn
,
but
hate
to
teach
;
her
progress
as
a
pupil
depend
upon
herself
,
and
I
see
that
on
herself
she
could
calculate
with
certainty
;
her
success
as
a
teacher
rest
partly
,
perhaps
chiefly
,
upon
the
will
of
other
;
it
cost
her
a
most
painful
effort
to
enter
into
conflict
with
this
foreign
will
,
to
endeavour
to
bend
it
into
subjection
to
her
own
;
for
in
what
regard
people
in
general
the
action
of
her
will
be
impede
by
many
scruple
;
it
be
as
unembarrassed
as
strong
where
her
own
affair
be
concern
,
and
to
it
she
could
at
any
time
subject
her
inclination
,
if
that
inclination
go
counter
to
her
conviction
of
right
;
yet
when
call
upon
to
wrestle
with
the
propensity
,
the
habit
,
the
fault
of
other
,
of
child
especially
,
who
be
deaf
to
reason
,
and
,
for
the
most
part
,
insensate
to
persuasion
,
her
will
sometimes
almost
refuse
to
act
;
then
come
in
the
sense
of
duty
,
and
force
the
reluctant
will
into
operation
.
<EOS>
a
wasteful
expense
of
energy
and
labour
be
frequently
the
consequence
;
france
toil
for
and
with
her
pupil
like
a
drudge
,
but
it
be
long
ere
her
conscientious
exertion
be
reward
by
anything
like
docility
on
their
part
,
because
they
see
that
they
have
power
over
her
,
inasmuch
as
by
resist
her
painful
attempt
to
convince
,
persuade
,
control
 
by
force
her
to
the
employment
of
coercive
measure
 
they
could
inflict
upon
her
exquisite
suffering
.
<EOS>
human
being
 
human
child
especially
 
seldom
deny
themselves
the
pleasure
of
exercise
a
power
which
they
be
conscious
of
possess
,
even
though
that
power
consist
only
in
a
capacity
to
make
other
wretched
;
a
pupil
whose
sensation
be
dull
than
those
of
his
instructor
,
while
his
nerve
be
tough
and
his
bodily
strength
perhaps
great
,
have
an
immense
advantage
over
that
instructor
,
and
he
will
generally
use
it
relentlessly
,
because
the
very
young
,
very
healthy
,
very
thoughtless
,
know
neither
how
to
sympathize
nor
how
to
spare
.
<EOS>
france
,
I
fear
,
suffer
much
;
a
continual
weight
seem
to
oppress
her
spirit
;
I
have
say
she
do
not
live
in
the
house
,
and
whether
in
her
own
abode
,
wherever
that
may
be
,
she
wear
the
same
preoccupied
,
unsmiling
,
sorrowfully
resolve
air
that
always
shade
her
feature
under
the
roof
of
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
,
I
could
not
tell
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
I
give
,
as
a
devoir
,
the
trite
<EOS>
little
anecdote
of
Alfred
tend
cake
in
the
herdsman
's
hut
,
to
be
relate
with
amplification
.
<EOS>
a
singular
affair
most
of
the
pupil
make
of
it
<EOS>
;
brevity
be
what
they
have
chiefly
study
;
the
majority
of
the
narrative
be
perfectly
unintelligible
;
those
of
Sylvie
and
Leonie
Ledru
alone
pretend
to
anything
like
sense
and
connection
.
<EOS>
Eulalie
,
indeed
,
have
hit
,
upon
a
clever
expedient
for
at
once
ensure
accuracy
and
saving
trouble
;
she
have
obtain
access
somehow
to
an
abridged
history
of
England
,
and
have
copy
the
anecdote
out
fair
.
<EOS>
I
write
on
the
margin
of
her
production
"
stupid
and
deceitful
,
"
and
then
tear
it
down
the
middle
.
  
<EOS>
last
in
the
pile
of
single
-
leaved
devoir
,
I
find
one
of
several
sheet
,
neatly
write
out
and
stitch
together
;
I
know
the
hand
,
and
scarcely
need
the
evidence
of
the
signature
"
Frances
Evans
Henri
"
to
confirm
my
conjecture
as
to
the
writer
's
identity
.
  
<EOS>
night
be
my
usual
time
for
correct
devoir
,
and
my
own
room
the
usual
scene
of
such
task
 
task
most
onerous
hitherto
;
and
it
seem
strange
to
me
to
feel
rise
within
me
an
incipient
sense
of
interest
,
as
I
snuff
the
candle
and
address
myself
to
the
perusal
of
the
poor
teacher
's
manuscript
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
think
I
,
"
I
shall
see
a
glimpse
of
what
she
really
be
;
I
shall
get
an
idea
of
the
nature
and
extent
of
her
power
;
not
that
she
can
be
expect
to
express
herself
well
in
a
foreign
tongue
,
but
still
,
if
she
have
any
mind
,
here
will
be
a
reflection
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
narrative
commence
by
a
description
of
a
Saxon
peasant
's
hut
,
situate
within
the
confine
of
a
great
,
leafless
,
winter
forest
<EOS>
;
it
represent
an
evening
in
December
;
flake
of
snow
be
fall
,
and
the
herdsman
foretell
a
heavy
storm
;
he
summon
his
wife
to
aid
him
in
collect
their
flock
,
roam
far
away
on
the
pastoral
bank
of
the
Thone
;
he
warn
her
that
it
will
be
late
ere
they
return
.
<EOS>
the
good
woman
be
reluctant
to
quit
her
occupation
of
baking
cake
for
the
evening
meal
;
but
acknowledge
the
primary
importance
of
secure
the
herd
and
flock
,
she
put
on
her
sheep
-
skin
mantle
;
and
,
address
a
stranger
who
rest
half
recline
on
a
bed
of
rush
near
the
hearth
,
bid
him
mind
the
bread
till
her
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
take
care
,
young
man

"
she
continue
,
"
that
you
fasten
the
door
well
after
us

above
all
,
open
to
none

our
absence

whatever
sound
you
hear
,
stir
not
,
and
look
not
out

<EOS>
the
night
will
soon
fall
;
this
forest
be
most
wild
and
lonely
;
strange
noise
be
often

therein
after
sunset

wolf
haunt
these
glade

danish
warrior
infest
the
country

you

afford
it
succour

a
greet
black
bull

a
shadowy
goblin
dog

rush
over

more

a
raven

dove
fly
in

settle
on

hearth

be
a
sure
sign

heed
my

nothing

awhile

I
need
not
continue
the
quotation

the
whole

in
the

strain

<EOS>
there
be
error

there
be
foreign

there

fault

rude

Destiny

<EOS>
this
she
have
do
without
a
hint
from
me
:
I
have
give
the
subject
,
but
not
say
a
word
about
the
manner
of
treat
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
find
,
or
make
,
an
opportunity
of
speak
to
her
,
"
I
say
to
myself
as
I
roll
the
devoir
up
;
"
I
will
learn
what
she
have
of
English
in
her
besides
the
name
of
Frances
Evans
;
she
be
no
novice
in
the
language
,
that
be
evident
,
yet
she
tell
me
she
have
neither
be
in
England
,
nor
take
lesson
in
English
,
nor
live
in
english
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
my
next
lesson
,
I
make
a
report
of
the
other
devoir
,
deal
out
praise
and
blame
in
very
small
retail
parcel
,
accord
to
my
custom
,
for
there
be
no
use
in
blame
severely
,
and
high
encomium
be
rarely
merit
.
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
of
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Henri
's
exercise
,
and
,
spectacle
on
nose
<EOS>
,
I
endeavour
to
decipher
in
her
countenance
her
sentiment
at
the
omission
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
find
out
whether
in
her
exist
a
consciousness
of
her
own
talent
.
<EOS>
"
if
she
think
she
do
a
clever
thing
in
compose
that
devoir
,
she
will
now
look
mortify
,
"
think
I.
Grave
as
usual
,
almost
sombre
,
be
her
face
;
as
usual
,
her
eye
be
fasten
on
the
cahier
open
before
her
;
there
be
something
,
I
think
,
of
expectation
in
her
attitude
,
as
I
conclude
a
brief
review
of
the
last
devoir
,
and
when
,
cast
it
from
me
and
rub
my
hand
,
I
bid
them
take
their
grammar
,
some
slight
change
do
pass
over
her
air
and
mien
,
as
though
she
now
relinquish
a
faint
prospect
of
pleasant
excitement
;
she
have
be
wait
for
something
to
be
discuss
in
which
she
have
a
degree
of
interest
;
the
discussion
be
not
to
come
on
,
so
expectation
sink
back
,
shrunk
and
sad
,
but
attention
,
promptly
fill
up
the
void
,
repair
in
a
moment
the
transient
collapse
of
feature
;
still
,
I
feel
,
rather
than
see
,
during
the
whole
course
of
the
lesson
,
that
a
hope
have
be
wrench
from
her
,
and
that
if
she
do
not
show
distress
,
it
be
because
she
would
not
.
  
<EOS>
at
four
o'clock
,
when
the
bell
rang
and
the
room
be
in
immediate
tumult
,
instead
of
take
my
hat
and
start
from
the
estrade
,
I
sit
still
a
moment
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
Frances
,
she
be
put
her
book
into
her
caba
;
have
fasten
the
button
,
she
raise
her
head
;
encounter
my
eye
,
she
make
a
quiet
,
respectful
obeisance
,
as
bid
good
afternoon
,
and
be
turn
to
depart
:
    
<EOS>
"
come
here
,
"
say
I
,
lift
my
finger
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
She
hesitate
;
she
could
not
hear
the
word
amidst
the
uproar
now
pervade
both
school
-
room
;
I
repeat
the
sign
;
she
approach
;
again
she
pause
within
half
a
yard
of
the
estrade
,
and
look
shy
,
and
still
doubtful
whether
she
have
mistake
my
meaning
.
  
<EOS>
"
step
up
,
"
I
say
,
speak
with
decision
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
only
way
of
deal
with
diffident
,
easily
embarrassed
character
,
and
with
some
slight
manual
aid
I
presently
get
her
place
just
where
I
want
her
to
be
,
that
is
,
between
my
desk
and
the
window
,
where
she
be
screen
from
the
rush
of
the
second
division
,
and
where
no
one
could
sneak
behind
her
to
listen
.
  
<EOS>
"
take
a
seat
,
"
I
say
,
place
a
tabouret
;
and
I
make
her
sit
down
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
be
do
would
be
consider
a
very
strange
thing
,
and
,
what
be
more
,
I
do
not
care
.
<EOS>
france
know
it
also
,
and
,
I
fear
,
by
an
appearance
of
agitation
and
trembling
,
that
she
care
much
.
<EOS>
I
draw
from
my
pocket
the
roll
-
up
devoir
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
be
yours
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
say
I
,
address
her
in
English
,
for
I
now
feel
sure
she
could
speak
English
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
she
answer
distinctly
;
and
as
I
unroll
it
and
lay
it
out
flat
on
the
desk
before
her
with
my
hand
upon
it
,
and
a
pencil
in
that
hand
,
I
see
her
moved
,
and
,
as
it
be
,
kindle
;
her
depression
beam
as
a
cloud
may
behind
which
the
sun
be
burn
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
devoir
have
numerous
fault
,
"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
It
will
take
you
some
year
of
careful
study
before
you
be
in
a
condition
to
write
English
with
absolute
correctness
.
<EOS>
attend
:
I
will
point
out
some
principal
defect
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
go
through
it
carefully
,
note
every
error
,
and
demonstrate
why
they
be
error
,
and
how
the
word
or
phrase
ought
to
have
be
write
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
this
sober
process
she
become
calm
.
<EOS>
I
now
go
on
:
  
"
<EOS>
as
to
the
substance
of
your
devoir
,
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Henri
,
it
have
surprise
me
;
I
peruse
it
with
pleasure
,
because
I
see
in
it
some
proof
of
taste
and
fancy
.
<EOS>
taste
and
fancy
be
not
the
high
gift
of
the
human
mind
,
but
such
as
they
be
you
possess
them
 
not
probably
in
a
paramount
degree
,
but
in
a
degree
beyond
what
the
majority
can
boast
.
<EOS>
You
may
then
take
courage
;
cultivate
the
faculty
that
God
and
nature
have
bestow
on
you
,
and
do
not
fear
in
any
crisis
of
suffering
,
under
any
pressure
of
injustice
,
to
derive
free
and
full
consolation
from
the
consciousness
of
their
strength
and
rarity
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
strength
and
rarity
!
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
to
myself
;
"
ay
,
the
word
be
probably
true
,
"
for
on
look
up
<EOS>
,
I
see
the
sun
have
dissever
its
screening
cloud
,
her
countenance
be
transfigure
,
a
smile
shone
in
her
eye
 
<EOS>
a
smile
almost
triumphant
<EOS>
;
it
seem
to
say
    
"
I
be
glad
you
have
be
force
to
discover
so
much
of
my
nature
;
you
need
not
so
carefully
moderate
your
language
.
<EOS>
do
you
think
I
be
myself
a
stranger
to
myself
?
<EOS>
what
you
tell
me
in
term
so
qualified
,
I
have
know
fully
from
a
child
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
do
say
this
as
plainly
as
a
frank
and
flashing
glance
could
,
but
in
a
moment
the
glow
of
her
complexion
,
the
radiance
of
her
aspect
,
have
subside
;
if
strongly
conscious
of
her
talent
,
she
be
equally
conscious
of
her
harass
defect
,
and
the
remembrance
of
these
obliterate
for
a
single
second
,
now
revive
with
sudden
force
,
at
once
subdue
the
too
vivid
character
in
which
her
sense
of
her
power
have
be
express
.
<EOS>
so
quick
be
the
revulsion
of
feeling
,
I
have
not
time
to
check
her
triumph
by
reproof
;
ere
I
could
contract
my
brow
to
a
frown
she
have
become
serious
and
almost
mournful
-
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
sir
,
"
say
she
,
rise
.
<EOS>
there
be
gratitude
both
in
her
voice
and
in
the
look
with
which
she
accompany
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
time
,
indeed
,
for
our
conference
to
terminate
;
for
,
when
I
glance
around
,
behold
all
the
boarder
(
the
day
-
scholar
have
depart
)
be
congregate
within
a
yard
or
two
of
my
desk
,
and
stand
stare
with
eye
and
mouth
wide
open
;
the
three
maitresse
form
a
whisper
knot
in
one
corner
,
and
,
close
at
my
elbow
,
be
the
directress
,
sit
on
a
low
chair
,
calmly
clip
the
tassel
of
her
finished
purse
.
    
<EOS>
after
all
I
have
profit
but
imperfectly
by
the
opportunity
I
have
so
boldly
achieve
of
speak
to
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
henri
<EOS>
;
it
be
my
intention
to
ask
her
how
she
come
to
be
possess
of
two
english
baptismal
name
,
Frances
and
Evans
,
in
addition
to
her
french
surname
,
also
whence
she
derive
her
good
accent
.
<EOS>
I
have
forget
both
point
,
or
,
rather
,
our
colloquy
have
be
so
brief
that
I
have
not
have
time
to
bring
them
forward
;
moreover
,
I
have
not
half
test
her
power
of
speak
English
;
all
I
have
draw
from
her
in
that
language
be
the
word
"
<EOS>
yes
,
"
and
"
thank
you
,
sir
.
"
<EOS>
"
no
matter
,
"
I
reflect
.
<EOS>
"
what
have
be
leave
incomplete
now
,
shall
be
finish
another
day
.
<EOS>
"
nor
do
I
fail
to
keep
the
promise
thus
make
to
myself
.
<EOS>
It
be
difficult
to
get
even
a
few
word
of
particular
conversation
with
one
pupil
among
so
many
;
but
,
accord
to
the
old
proverb
,
"
where
there
be
a
will
,
there
be
a
way
;
"
and
again
and
again
I
manage
to
find
an
opportunity
for
exchange
a
few
word
with
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Henri
,
regardless
that
envy
stare
and
detraction
whisper
whenever
I
approach
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
book
an
instant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
such
be
the
mode
in
which
I
often
begin
these
brief
dialogue
;
the
time
be
always
just
at
the
conclusion
of
the
lesson
;
and
motion
to
her
to
rise
,
I
instal
myself
in
her
place
,
allow
her
to
stand
deferentially
at
my
side
;
for
I
esteem
it
wise
and
<EOS>
right
in
her
case
to
enforce
strictly
all
form
ordinarily
in
use
between
master
and
pupil
;
the
rather
because
I
perceive
that
in
proportion
as
my
manner
grow
austere
and
magisterial
,
her
become
easy
and
self
-
possess
 
an
odd
contradiction
,
doubtless
,
to
the
ordinary
effect
in
such
case
;
but
so
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
pencil
,
"
say
I
,
hold
out
my
hand
without
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
(
I
be
now
about
to
sketch
a
brief
report
of
the
first
of
these
conference
.
)
<EOS>
She
give
me
one
,
and
while
I
underline
some
error
in
a
grammatical
exercise
she
have
write
,
I
observe
    
<EOS>

Monsieur

I
beg
my

have
me
teach
lace

mending
soon
after

Brussels

because
I
know
it

a

by

I
could
earn
some
money
very

I
learn
it
in

when
I
can
write

speak

well

it
will
be
difficult

<EOS>
in

my

walk
the

round
every

I
could
not

out

have
I
rest
 
remain
there
even
till
my

I
should
never

I

I
have

great
acquirement

when
I
be
quite
tired

round

I
beg
my

to
go
to
Brussels

my
existence
be
no
large
here

because
I
be
no
rich

I
walk

us
advert
to
another
subject

you
propose
to
devote
your

unsuccessful
teacher

bend

soon
raise

Monsieur

I

no

have
no

deprive

in

you
would
be
a
foreigner

that
too
would
deprive
you

would
effectually
separate
you

I
should

learn
something

probably
difficulty

I

if
I
must
contend

what

over

some
direction
with
a
pencil
on
the
margin
of
her
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
be
you
pleased
that
I
be
satisfied
with
your
progress
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
she
slowly
,
gently
,
the
blush
that
have
half
subside
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
not
say
enough
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
I
continue
.
<EOS>
"
My
praise
be
too
cool
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
make
no
answer
,
and
,
I
think
,
look
a
little
sad
.
<EOS>
I
divine
her
thought
,
and
should
much
have
like
to
have
respond
to
them
,
have
it
be
expedient
so
to
do
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
now
very
ambitious
of
my
admiration
 
not
eagerly
desirous
of
dazzle
me
;
a
little
affection
 
ever
so
little
 
please
her
well
than
all
the
panegyric
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
feel
this
,
I
stand
a
good
while
behind
her
,
write
on
the
margin
of
her
book
.
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
quit
my
station
or
relinquish
my
occupation
;
something
retain
me
bend
there
,
my
head
very
near
her
,
and
my
hand
near
hers
too
;
but
the
margin
of
a
copy
-
book
be
not
an
illimitable
space
 
<EOS>
so
,
doubtless
,
the
directress
think
;
and
she
take
occasion
to
walk
past
in
order
to
ascertain
by
what
art
I
prolong
so
disproportionately
the
period
necessary
for
fill
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
go
.
<EOS>
distasteful
effort
 
<EOS>
to
leave
what
we
most
prefer
!
  
<EOS>
france
do
not
become
pale
or
feeble
in
consequence
of
her
sedentary
employment
;
perhaps
the
stimulus
it
communicate
to
her
mind
counterbalance
the
inaction
it
impose
on
her
body
.
<EOS>
She
change
,
indeed
,
change
obviously
and
rapidly
;
but
it
be
for
the
well
.
<EOS>
when
I
first
see
her
,
her
countenance
be
sunless
,
her
complexion
colourless
;
she
look
like
one
who
have
no
source
of
enjoyment
,
no
store
of
bliss
anywhere
in
the
world
;
now
the
cloud
have
pass
from
her
mien
,
leave
space
for
the
dawn
of
hope
and
interest
,
and
those
feeling
rise
like
a
clear
morning
,
animate
what
have
be
depress
,
tint
what
have
be
pale
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
,
whose
colour
I
have
not
at
first
know
,
so
dim
be
they
with
repressed
tear
,
so
shadow
with
ceaseless
dejection
,
now
,
light
by
a
ray
of
the
sunshine
that
cheer
her
heart
,
reveal
irid
of
<EOS>
bright
hazel
 
irid
large
and
full
,
screened
with
long
lash
;
and
pupil
instinct
with
fire
.
<EOS>
that
look
of
wan
emaciation
which
anxiety
or
low
spirit
often
communicate
to
a
thoughtful
,
thin
face
,
rather
long
than
round
,
have
vanish
from
her
,
a
clearness
of
skin
almost
bloom
,
and
a
plumpness
almost
embonpoint
,
soften
the
decide
line
of
her
feature
.
<EOS>
Her
figure
share
in
this
beneficial
change
;
it
become
round
,
and
as
the
harmony
of
her
form
be
complete
and
her
stature
of
the
graceful
middle
height
,
one
do
not
regret
(
or
at
least
I
do
not
regret
)
<EOS>
the
absence
of
confirm
fulness
,
<EOS>
in
contour
,
still
slight
,
though
compact
,
elegant
,
flexible
 
the
exquisite
turning
of
waist
,
wrist
,
hand
,
foot
,
and
ankle
satisfy
completely
my
notion
of
symmetry
,
and
allow
a
lightness
and
freedom
of
movement
which
correspond
with
my
idea
of
grace
.
  
<EOS>
thus
improve
,
thus
waken
to
life
,
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Henri
begin
to
take
a
new
footing
in
the
school
;
her
mental
power
,
manifest
gradually
but
steadily
,
ere
long
extort
recognition
even
from
the
envious
;
and
when
the
young
and
healthy
see
that
she
could
smile
brightly
,
converse
gaily
,
move
with
vivacity
and
alertness
,
they
acknowledge
in
her
a
sisterhood
of
youth
and
health
,
and
tolerate
her
as
of
their
kind
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
to
speak
truth
,
I
watch
this
change
much
as
a
gardener
watch
the
growth
of
a
precious
plant
,
and
I
contribute
to
it
too
,
even
as
the
say
gardener
contribute
to
the
development
of
his
favourite
.
<EOS>
to
me
it
be
not
difficult
to
discover
how
I
could
best
foster
my
pupil
,
cherish
her
starve
feeling
,
and
induce
the
outward
manifestation
of
that
inward
vigour
which
sunless
drought
and
blighting
blast
<EOS>
have
hitherto
forbid
to
expand
.
<EOS>
constancy
of
attention
 
a
kindness
as
mute
as
watchful
,
always
stand
by
her
,
cloak
in
the
rough
garb
of
austerity
,
and
make
its
real
nature
know
only
by
a
rare
glance
of
interest
,
or
a
cordial
and
gentle
word
;
real
respect
mask
with
seem
imperiousness
,
direct
,
urge
her
action
,
yet
help
her
too
,
and
<EOS>
that
with
devoted
care
:
these
be
the
mean
I
use
,
for
these
mean
best
suited
Frances
'
feeling
,
as
susceptible
as
deep
vibrate
 
her
nature
at
once
proud
and
shy
.
  
<EOS>
the
benefit
of
my
system
become
apparent
also
in
her
altered
demeanour
as
a
teacher
;
she
now
take
her
place
amongst
her
pupil
with
an
air
of
spirit
and
firmness
which
assure
them
at
once
that
she
mean
to
be
obey
 
and
obey
she
be
.
<EOS>
They
feel
they
have
lose
their
power
over
her
.
<EOS>
if
any
girl
have
rebel
,
she
would
no
longer
have
take
her
rebellion
to
heart
;
she
possess
a
source
of
comfort
they
could
not
drain
,
a
pillar
of
support
they
could
not
overthrow
:
formerly
,
when
insult
,
she
weep
;
now
,
she
smile
.
  
<EOS>
the
public
reading
of
one
of
her
devoir
achieve
the
revelation
of
her
talent
to
all
and
sundry
;
I
remember
the
subject
 
<EOS>
it
be
an
emigrant
's
letter
to
his
friend
at
home
.
<EOS>
It
open
with
simplicity
;
some
natural
and
graphic
touch
disclose
to
the
reader
the
scene
of
virgin
forest
and
great
,
new
-
World
river
 
barren
of
sail
and
flag
 
amidst
which
the
epistle
be
suppose
to
be
indite

<EOS>
the
difficulty
and
danger
that
attend
a
settler
's
life
,
be
hint
at
;
and
in
the
few
word
say
on
that
subject
,
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Henri
fail
not
to
render
audible
the
voice
of
resolve
,
patience
,
endeavour
.
<EOS>
the
disaster
which
have
drive
him
from
his
native
country
be
allude
to
;
stainless
honour
,
inflexible
independence
,
indestructible
self

respect
there
take
the
word
.
<EOS>
past
day
be
speak
of
;
the
grief
of
parting
,
the
regret
of
absence
,
be
touch
upon
;
feeling
,
forcible
and
fine
,
breathe
eloquent
in
every

.
<EOS>
at
the
close
,
consolation
be
suggest
;
religious
faith
become
there
the
speaker
,
and
she
speak
well
.
  
<EOS>
the
devoir
be
powerfully
write
in
language
at
once
chaste
and
choice
,
in
a
style
nerve
with
vigour
and
grace
with
harmony
.
  
<EOS>
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
be
quite
sufficiently
acquaint
with
English
to
understand
it
when
read
or
speak
in
her
presence
,
though
she
could
neither
speak
nor
write
it
herself
.
<EOS>
during
the
perusal
of
this
devoir
,
she
sit
placidly
busy
,
her
eye
and
finger
occupy
with
the
formation
of
a
"
riviere
"
or
open
-
work
hem
round
a
cambric
handkerchief
;
she
say
nothing
,
and
her
face
and
forehead
,
clothe
with
a
mask
of
purely
negative
expression
,
be
as
blank
of
comment
as
her
lip
.
<EOS>
as
neither
surprise
,
pleasure
,
approbation
,
nor

be
evince
in
her
countenance

so
no

;
if
that
inscrutable
mien
say
anything
,
it
be
simply
this
    
<EOS>
"
the
matter
be
too
trite
to
excite
an
emotion
,
or
call
forth
an
opinion
.
"
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
have
do
,
a
hum
rise
;
several
of
the
pupil
,
press
round
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Henri
,
begin
to
beset
her
with
compliment
;
the
compose
voice
of
the
directress
be
now
hear
:
    
"
young
lady
,
such
of
you
as
have
cloak
and
umbrella
will
hasten
to
return
home
before
the
shower

heavy
"
(
it
be
rain
a
little
)
,
"
the
remainder
will
wait
till
their
respective
servant
arrive
to
fetch
them
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
school
disperse
,
for
it
be
four
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
a
word
,
"
say
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
,
step
on
to
the
estrade
,
and
signify
,
by
a
movement
of
the
hand
,
that
she
wish
me
to
relinquish
,
for
an
instant
,
the
castor
I
have
clutch
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
,
I
be
at
your
service
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
it
be
of
course
an
excellent
plan
to
encourage
effort
in
young
people
by
make
conspicuous
the
progress
of
any
particularly
industrious
pupil
;
but
do
you
not
think
that
in
the
present
instance
,
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Henri
can
hardly
be
consider
as
a
concurrent
with
the
other
pupil
?
<EOS>
She
be
old
than
most
of
them
,
and
have
have
advantage
of
an
exclusive
nature
for
acquire
a
knowledge
of
English
;
on
the
other
hand
,
her
sphere
of
life
be
somewhat
beneath
theirs
;
under
these
circumstance
,
a
public
distinction
,
confer
upon
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Henri
,
may
be
the
mean
of
suggest
comparison
,
and
exciting
feeling
such
as
would
be
far
from
advantageous
to
the
individual
form
their
object
.
<EOS>
the
interest
I
take
in
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Henri
's
real
welfare
make
me
desirous
of
screen
her
from
annoyance
of
this
sort
;
besides
,
monsieur
,
as
I
have
before
hint
to
you
,
the
sentiment
of
AMOUR
-
PROPRE
have
a
somewhat
mark
preponderance
in
her
character
;
celebrity
have
a
tendency
to
foster
this
sentiment
,
and
in
her
it
should
be
rather
repressed
 
<EOS>
she
rather
need
keep
down
than
bring
forward
;
and
then
I
think
,
monsieur
 
<EOS>
it
appear
to
me
that
ambition
,
LITERARY
ambition
especially
,
be
not
a
feeling
to
be
cherish
in
the
mind
of
a
woman
:
would
not
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
henri
be
much
safe
and
happy
if
teach
to
believe
that
in
the
quiet
discharge
of
social
duty
consist
her
real
vocation
,
than
if
stimulate
to
aspire
after
applause
and
publicity
?
<EOS>
She
may
never
marry
;
scanty
as
be
her
resource
,
obscure
as
be
her
connection
,
uncertain
as
be
her
health
<EOS>
(
for
I
think
her
consumptive
,
her
mother
die
of
that
complaint
)
,
it
be
more
than
probable
she
never
will
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
how
she
can
rise
to
a
position
,
whence
such
a
step
would
be
possible
;
but
even
in
celibacy
it
would
be
well
for
her
to
retain
the
character
and
habit
of
a
respectable
decorous
female
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
indisputably
,
mademoiselle
,
"
be
my
answer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
opinion
admit
of
no
doubt
;
"
and
,
fearful
of
the
harangue
be
renew
,
I
retreat
under
cover
of
that
cordial
sentence
of
assent
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
date
of
a
fortnight
after
the
little
incident
note
above
,
I
find
it
record
in
my
diary
that
a
hiatus
occur
in
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Henri
's
usually
regular
attendance
in
class
.
<EOS>
the
first
day
or
two
I
wonder
at
her
absence
,
but
do
not
like
to
ask
an
explanation
of
it
;
I
think
indeed
some
chance
word
may
be
drop
which
would
afford
me
the
information
I
wish
to
obtain
,
without
my
run
the
risk
of
exciting
silly
smile
and
gossip
whisper
by
demand
it
.
<EOS>
but
when
a
week
pass
and
the
seat
at
the
desk
near
the
door
still
remain
vacant
,
and
when
no
allusion
be
make
to
the
circumstance
by
any
individual
of
the
class
 
<EOS>
when
,
on
the
contrary
,
I
find
that
all
observe
a
marked
silence
on
the
point
 
<EOS>
I
determine
,
COUTE
QUI
COUTE
,
to
break
the
ice
of
this
silly
reserve
.
<EOS>
I
select
Sylvie
as
my
informant
,
because
from
her
I
know
that
I
should
at
least
get
a
sensible
answer
,
unaccompanied
by
wriggle
,
titter
,
or
other
flourish
of
folly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ou

<EOS>
Henri

<EOS>
"
I
say
one
day
as
I

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
  
"
ah

"
be
my
involuntary
exclamation
;
then
after
a
pause
:
    
<EOS>
"
En

"
  
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
I
could
pursue
my
inquiry
no
further
;
time
,
place
,
and
circumstance
forbid
my
add
another
word
.
<EOS>
I
could
neither
comment
on
what
have
be
say
,
nor
demand
further
particular
.
<EOS>
a
question
as
to
the
reason
of
the
teacher
's
departure
,
as
to
whether
it
have
be
voluntary
or
otherwise
,
be
indeed
on
my
lip
,
but
I
suppress
it
 
there
be
listener
all
round
.
<EOS>
an
hour
after
,
in
pass
Sylvie
in
the
corridor
as
she
be
put
on
her
bonnet
,
I
stop
short
and
ask
:
    
"
Sylvie
,
do
you
know
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Henri
's
address
?
<EOS>
I
have
some
book
of
her
,
"
I
add
carelessly
,
"
and
I
should
wish
to
send
them
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
monsieur
,
"
reply
Sylvie
;
"
but
perhaps
Rosalie
,
the
portress
,
will
be
able
to
give
it
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rosalie
's
cabinet
be
just
at
hand
;
I
step
in
and
repeat
the
inquiry
.
<EOS>
Rosalie
 
<EOS>
a
smart
french
grisette
 
look
up
from
her
work
with
a
know
smile
,
precisely
the
sort
of
smile
I
have
be
so
desirous
to
avoid
exciting
.
<EOS>
Her
answer
be
prepared
;
she
know
nothing
whatever
of
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Henri
's
address
 
have
never
know
it
.
<EOS>
turn
from
her
with
impatience
 
<EOS>
for
I
believe
she
lie
and
be
hire
to
lie
 
<EOS>
I
almost
knock
down
some
one
who
have
be
stand
at
my
back
;
it
be
the
directress
.
<EOS>
My
abrupt
movement
make
her
recoil
two
or
three
step
.
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
apologize
,
which
I
do
more
concisely
than
politely
.
<EOS>
no
man
like
to
be
dog
,
and
in
the
very
irritable
mood
in
which
I
then
be
the
sight
of
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
thoroughly
incense
me
.
<EOS>
at
the
moment
I
turn
her
countenance
look
hard
,
dark
,
and
inquisitive
;
her
eye
be
bent
upon
me
with
an
expression
of
almost
hungry
curiosity
.
<EOS>
I
have
scarcely
catch
this
phase
of
physiognomy
ere
it
have
vanish
;
a
bland
smile
play
on
her
feature
;
my
harsh
apology
be
receive
with
good
-
humoured
facility
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
do
not
mention
it
,
monsieur
;
you
only
touch
my
hair
with
your
elbow
;
it
be
no
bad
,
only
a
little
dishevelled
.
"
<EOS>
She
shake
it
back
,
and
pass
her
finger
through
her
curl
,
loosen
them
into
more
numerous
and
flow
ringlet
.
<EOS>
then
she
go
on
with
vivacity
:
  
<EOS>
"
Rosalie
,
I
be
come
to
tell
you
to
go
instantly
and
close
the
window
of
the
salon
;
the
wind
be
rise
,
and
the
muslin
curtain
will
be
cover
with
dust
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rosalie
depart
.
<EOS>
"
now
,
"
think
I
,
"
this
will
not
do
;
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
think
her
meanness
in
eave
-
dropping
be
screen
by
her
art
in
devise
a
pretext
,
whereas
the
muslin
curtain
she
speak
of
be
not
more
transparent
than
this
same
pretext
.
"
<EOS>
an
impulse
come
over
me
to
thrust
the
flimsy
screen
aside
,
and
confront
her
craft
boldly
with
a
word
or
two
of
plain
truth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
rough
-
shod
foot
tread
most
firmly
on
slippery
ground
,
"
think
I
;
<EOS>
so
I
begin
:
  
"
Mademoiselle
Henri
have
leave
your
establishment
 
<EOS>
be
dismiss
,
I
presume
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
I
wish
to
have
a
little
conversation
with
you
,
monsieur
,
"
reply
the
directress
with
the
most
natural
and
affable
air
in
the
world
;
"
but
we
can
not
talk
quietly
here
;
will
Monsieur
step
into
the
garden
a
minute
?
"
<EOS>
and
she
precede
me
,
step
out
through
the
glass
-
door
I
have
before
mention
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
,
"
say
she
,
when
we
have
reach
the
centre
of
the
middle
alley
,
and
when
the
foliage
of
shrub
and
tree
,
now
in
their
summer
pride
,
close
behind
end
around
us
,
shut
out
the
view
of
the
house
,
and
thus
impart
a
sense
of
seclusion
even
to
this
little
plot
of
ground
in
the
very
core
of
a
capital
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
,
one
feel
quiet
and
free
when
there
be
only
pear
-
tree
and
rise
-
bush
about
one
;
I
dare
say
you
,
like
me
,
monsieur
,
be
sometimes
tired
of
be
eternally
in
the
midst
of
life
;
of
have
human
face
always
round
you
,
human
eye
always
upon
you
,
human
voice
always
in
your
ear
.
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
often
wish
intensely
for
liberty
to
spend
a
whole
month
in
the
country
at
some
little
farm
-
house
,
bien
gentille
,
bien
propre

tout
entouree

<EOS>
"
Que

"
continue
the
directress
;
and
she
be
right
there
,
for
it
be
a
south
wind
,
soft
and
sweet
.
<EOS>
I
carry
my
hat
in
my
hand
,
and
this
gentle
breeze
,
pass
through
my
hair
,
soothe
my
temple
like
balm
.
<EOS>
Its
refreshing
effect
,
however
,
penetrate
no
deep
than
the
mere
surface
of
the
frame
;
for
as
I
walk
by
the
side
of
Mdlle

<EOS>
Reuter
,
my
heart
be
still
hot
within
me
,
and
while
I
be
muse
the
fire
burn
;
then
spake
I
with
my
tongue
:
    
<EOS>
"
I
understand
Mdlle

<EOS>
Henri

go
from
hence
,

not

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
true
!
<EOS>
I
mean
to
have
name
the
subject
to
you
some
day
ago

my
time
be
so
completely
take
up
,
I
can
not
do
half
the
thing
I
wish
:
have
you
never

what
it
be

to
find
the
day
too
short
by
twelve
hour

your
numerous
duty

"
not
often

<EOS>
Mdlle

<EOS>
Henri
's
departure
be
not
voluntary

I
presume
?
<EOS>
if
it
have
be
,
she
would
certainly
have
give
me
some
intimation
of
it

my
pupil

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
do
she
not
tell
you
?
<EOS>
that
be
strange
;
for
my
part

I
never
think
of
advert
to
the
subject
;
when
one
have
so
many
thing
to
attend
to

one
be
apt
to
forget
little
incident

not

primary

<EOS>
"
You
consider
Mdlle

Henri

dismission

insignificant
event

"
  
<EOS>
"
Dismission
?
<EOS>
ah
!

she
be
not

I
can
say
with
truth

that
since
I

no
master

ever

some
have
leave
it

mademoiselle

"
  
<EOS>
"
many

I
have
find
it
necessary

change
frequently
 
a
change
of

often
beneficial
to

a
school

it
give
life

variety
to
the

amuse

the

<EOS>
We
have
now
reach
the
garden

chair
;
the
directress
sit
down
,
and
sign
to
me
to
sit
by
her
,

I
only
rest
my
knee
on
the
seat
,
and
stand
lean
my
head
and
arm
against
the
embowering
branch
of
a
huge
laburnum
,
whose
golden
flower

blent
with
the
dusky

over

<EOS>
Reuter
sit
silent
a
moment
;
some
novel
movement
be
evidently
work
in
her
mind
,
and
they
show
their
nature
on
her
astute
brow
;
she
be
meditate
some
CHEF
d'oeuvre
of
policy
.
<EOS>
convince
by
several
month
'
experience
that
the
affectation
of
virtue
she
do
not
possess
be
unavaile
to
ensnare
me
 
aware
that
I
have
read
her
real
nature
,
and
would
believe
nothing
of
the
character
she
give
out
as
be
her
 
<EOS>
she
have
determine
,
at
last
,
to
try
a
new
key
,
and
see
if
the
lock
of
my
heart
would
yield
to
that
;
a
little
audacity
,
a
word
of
truth
,
a
glimpse
of
the
real
.
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
will
try
,
"
be
her
inward
resolve
;
and
then
her
blue
eye
glitter
upon
me
 
it
do
not
flash
 
nothing
of
flame
ever
kindle
in
its
temperate
gleam
.
  
<EOS>
"
monsieur
fear
to
sit
by
me
?
"
<EOS>
she
inquire
playfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
wish
to
usurp
Pelet
's
place
,
"
I
answer
,
for
I
have
get
the
habit
of
speak
to
her
bluntly
 
a
habit
begin
in
anger
,
but
continue
because
I
see
that
,
instead
of
offend
,
it
fascinate
her
.
<EOS>
She
cast
down
her
eye
,
and
droop
her
eyelid
;
she
sigh
uneasily
;
she
turn
with
an
anxious
gesture
,
as
if
she
would
give
me
the
idea
of
a
bird
that
flutter
in
its
cage

and
would
fain
fly
from
its
jail
and
jailer
,
and
seek
its
natural
mate

pleasant
nest

<EOS>
"
well
 
and
your
lesson
?
"
I
demand
briefly
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!

she
exclaim
,
recover
herself
,

you

here
it

then

far
more
be
to
be
do
in
this

by
dexterity
than
by
strength

but
,
<EOS>
perhaps
,
you
know
that
before

there
be
delicacy

power

as
well

pride

"
go
on
,
"
say
I
;
and
I
could
hardly
help
smile
,
the
flattery
be
so
piquant
,
so
finely
season
.
<EOS>
She
catch
the
prohibit
smile
,
though
I
pass
my
hand
over
my
month
to
conceal
it
;
and
again
she
make
room
for
me
to
sit
beside
her
.
<EOS>
I
shake
my
head
,
though
temptation
penetrate
to
my
sense
at
the
moment

once
more
I
tell
her
to
go
on

well

then

ever
you

off

the
right

will
tell
you
what
I

good
to
do

I

"
<EOS>
She
look
up
again
;
she
have
compound
her
glance
well
this
time
 
<EOS>
much
archness
,
more
deference
,
a
spicy
dash
of
coquetry
,
an
unveil
consciousness
of
capacity

<EOS>
I
nod
;
she
treat
me
like

so
I
become
the
great
Mogul
as
far
as

<EOS>
"
I
like
,
monsieur
,
to
take
my
knitting
in
my
hand
,
and
to
sit
quietly
down
in
my
chair
;
circumstance
defile
past
me
;
I
watch
their
march
;
so
long
as
they
follow
the
course
I
wish

I
say
nothing

and
do
nothing

I
do
not
clap
my

cry
out

how
lucky
I
be
!
"
<EOS>
to
attract
the
attention
and
envy
of
my

I
be
merely
passive

when
event
fall
out
ill
 
when
circumstance
become
adverse
 
I
watch
very
vigilantly
;
I
knit
on
still

still
I
hold
my
tongue
;
but
every
now
and
then
,
monsieur
,
I
just
put
my
toe
out
 
<EOS>
so
 
and
give
the
rebellious
circumstance
a
little
secret
push

without
noise

send
it
the
way
I

I
be
successful

<EOS>
a
moment
since

I

her
alluring

this
speech
conclude

I
look
on

with
distaste

in

you

you

<EOS>
"
not
at
all
,
monsieur

I
be
merely
anxious
about
Mdlle

<EOS>
Henri

health
;
no
,
your
moral
sight
be
clear
and
pierce
,
but
there
you
have
fail
to
discover
the
truth

<EOS>
I
take
 
I
have
always
take
a
real
interest
in
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Henri
's
welfare
;
I
do
not
like
her
go
out
in
all
weather
;
I
think
it
would
be
more
advantageous
for
her
to
obtain
a
permanent
situation
;
besides
,
I
consider
her
now
qualified
to
do
something
more
than
teach
sewing
.
<EOS>
I
reason
with
her
;
leave
the
decision
to
herself
;
she
see
the
correctness
of
my
view
,
and
adopt
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
excellent
!
<EOS>

now
,
mademoiselle

you
will
have
the
goodness
to
give
me
her
address

"
  
<EOS>
"
Her
address

a
sombre
and
stony
change
come
over
the
mien

<EOS>
Her
address
?
<EOS>
ah
?
 
<EOS>
well
 
I
wish
I
could
oblige
you
,
monsieur

but
I
can
not
,
and
I
will
tell
you
why
;
whenever
I
myself
ask
her
for
her
address
<EOS>
,
she
always
evade
the
inquiry
.
<EOS>
I
think
 
I
may
be
wrong
 
<EOS>

I
think
her
motive
for
do
so
,
be
a
natural
,
though
mistaken
reluctance
to
introduce
me
to
some
,
<EOS>
probably
,
very
poor
abode
<EOS>
;
her
mean
be
narrow
,
her
origin
obscure

she
live
somewhere

doubtless
,
in
the
"
basse

<EOS>
"
  
"
I
will
not
lose
sight
of
my
good
pupil
yet

say
I
,

though
she
be
bear
of
beggar
and
lodge
in
a
cellar
;
for
the
rest
,
it
be
absurd
to
make
a
bugbear
of
her
origin
to
me
 
<EOS>
I
happen
to
know
that
she
be
a
swiss
pastor
's
daughter
,
neither
more
nor
less
;
and
,
as
to
her
narrow
mean
,
I
care
nothing
for
the
poverty
of
her
purse
so
long
as
her
heart
overflow
with
affluence

"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
sentiment

perfectly
noble

say
the
directress

affect
to
suppress
a
yawn
;
her
sprightliness
be
now
extinct

her
temporary
candour
shut
up

the
little

red

coloured

piratical

NOVELISTS
should
never
allow
themselves
to
weary
of
the
study
of
real
life
.
<EOS>
if
they
observe
this
duty
conscientiously
,
they
would
give
us
few
picture
chequer
with
vivid
contrast
of
light
and

they
would
seldom
elevate
their
hero
and
heroine
to
the

of
rapture
 
<EOS>
still
seldomer
sink
them
to
the
depth
of
despair
;
for
if
we
rarely
taste
the
fulness
of
joy
in
this

we
yet
more
rarely
savour
the
acrid
bitterness
of
hopeless
anguish

indeed

we

plunge
like

into

abuse

again
overstrain
,
and
,
at
last

destroy
our

truly

we
may
find
ourselves
without

Our

can
it
end

<EOS>
We

break
the

life
must
be
all

too
feeble

death
<EOS>
must

darkness
 
God

can

no

where
linger
only
hideous

pollute
recollection

and
time
bring
us
on
to
the
brink
of
the
grave
,
and
dissolution
fling
us
in
 
a

eat
through

with

take

some

<EOS>
well

what
suggest
all
this
?
<EOS>
and
what
be
the

therefrom
?
<EOS>
what
suggest
it
,
be
the
circumstance
of
my
good
pupil
 
<EOS>
my
treasure
 
be
snatch
from
my
hand
,
and
put
away
out

the

from
it
be
 
that
,
be
a
steady

I
do
not

nor
do
I
allow
them
to
monopolize

I
pen
them

on

contrary

in
one
strait

secret
nook

<EOS>
in
the
daytime
,
too
,
when
I
be
about
my
duty
,
I
put
them
on
the
silent
system
;
and
it
be
only
after
I
have
close
the
door
of
my

at
night
that
I
somewhat
relax
my
severity
towards
these
morose
nursling

and
allow
vent
to
their
language
of
murmur
;
then
,
in
revenge
,
they
sit
on
my
pillow
,
haunt
my
bed
,
and
keep
me
awake
with
their
long
,
midnight
cry
.
  
<EOS>
a
week
pass

<EOS>
I
have
say
nothing
more
to
Mdlle

<EOS>
Reuter
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
calm
in
my
demeanour
to
her

though
stony
cold

hard

<EOS>
when
I
look
at
her
,
it
be
with
the
glance
fitting
to
be
bestow
on
one
who
I
know
have
consult
jealousy
as
an
adviser
,
and
employ
treachery
as
an
instrument
 
the
glance
of
quiet
disdain

root
distrust

<EOS>
on
Saturday
evening
,
ere
I
leave

I
stept
into
the
SALLE
-
a

MANGER
,
where
she
be
sit
alone
,
and
,
place
myself
before
her
,
I
ask
,
with
the

tranquil
tone
and
manner
that
I
should
have
use
have
I
put
the
question
for
the
first
time
    
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
,
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
give
me
the
address
of
france
Evans
Henri
?
"
  
<EOS>
a
little
surprised
,
but
not
disconcert
,
she
smilingly
disclaim
any
knowledge
of
that
address
,
add
,
"
Monsieur
have
perhaps
forget
that
I
explain
all
about
that
circumstance
before
 
a
week
ago
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
,
"
I
continue
,
"
you
would
greatly
oblige
me
by
direct
me
to
that
young
person
's
abode
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
seem
somewhat
puzzled
;
and
,
at
last
,
look
up
with
an
admirably
counterfeit
air
of
naivete
,
she
demand
,
"
do
Monsieur
think
I
be
tell
an
untruth
?
"
  
<EOS>
still
avoid
to
give
her
a
direct
answer
,
I
say
,
"
It
be
not
then
your
intention
,
mademoiselle
,
to
oblige
me
in
this
particular
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
monsieur
,
how
can
I
tell
you
what
I
do
not
know
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
very
well
;
I
understand
you
perfectly
,
mademoiselle
,
and
now
I
have
only
two
or
three
word
to
say
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
last
week
in
July
;
in
another
month
the
vacation
will
commence
,
have
the
goodness
to
avail
yourself
of
the
leisure
it
will
afford
you
to
look
out
for
another
english
master
 
at
the
close
of
August
,
I
shall
be
under
the
necessity
of
resign
my
post
in
your
establishment
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
do
not
wait
for
her
comment
on
this
announcement
,
but
bow
and
immediately
withdraw
.
  
<EOS>
that
same
evening
,
soon
after
dinner
,
a
servant
bring
me
a
small
packet
;
it
be
direct
in
a
hand
I
know
,
but
have
not
hope
so
soon
to
see
again
;
be
in
my
own
apartment
and
alone
<EOS>
,
there
be
nothing
to
prevent
my
immediately
open
it
;
it
contain
four
five

franc
piece
,
and
a
note
in
English

<EOS>
"
MONSIEUR
,
  
"
I
come
to
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
's
house
yesterday
,
at
the
time
when
I
know
you
would
be
just
about
finish
your
lesson
,
and
<EOS>
I
ask
if
I
may
go
into
the
schoolroom
and
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
come
out
and
say
you
be
already
go
;
it
have
not
yet
strike
four
,
so
I
think
she
must
be
mistake
,
but
conclude
it
would
be
vain
to
call
another
day
on
the
same
errand
.
<EOS>
in
one
sense
a
note
will
do
as
well
 
<EOS>
it
will
wrap
up
the
20
franc
,
the
price
of
the
lesson
I
have
receive
from
you
;
and
if
it
will
not
fully
express
the
thank
I
owe
you
in
addition
 
if
it
will
not
bid
you
good
-
bye
as
I
could
wish
to
have
do
 
if
it
will
not
tell
you
,
as
I
long
to
do
,
how
sorry
I
be
that
I
shall
probably
never
see
you
more
 
why
,
spoken
word
would
hardly
be
more
adequate
to
the
task
.
<EOS>
have
I
see
you
,
I
should
probably
have
stammer
out
something
<EOS>
feeble
and
unsatisfactory
 
something
belie
my
feeling
rather
than
explain
them
<EOS>
;
so
it
be
perhaps
as
well
that
I
be
deny
admission
to
your
presence
.
<EOS>
You
often
remark
,
monsieur
,
that
my
devoirs
dwelt
a
great
deal
on
fortitude
in
bearing
grief
 
<EOS>
you
say
I
introduce
that
theme
too
often
<EOS>
:
I
find
indeed
that
it
be
much
easy
to
write
about
a
severe
duty
than
to
perform
it
,
for
I
be
oppress
when
I
see
and
feel
to
what
a
reverse
fate
have
condemn
me
;
you
be
kind
to
me
,
monsieur
 
very
kind
;
I
be
afflict
 
<EOS>
I
be
heart
-
break
to
be
quite
separate
from
you
;
soon
I
shall
have
no
friend
on
earth
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
useless
troubling
you
with
my
distress
.
<EOS>
what
claim
have
I
on
your
sympathy
?
<EOS>
none
;
I
will
then
say
no
more

"

F.

<EOS>
I
put
up
the
note
in
my
pocket
-
book
.
<EOS>
I
slip
the
five
-
franc
piece
into
my
purse
 
<EOS>
then
I
take
a
turn
through
my
narrow
chamber

<EOS>
"
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
talk
about
her
poverty
,
"
say
I
,

and
she
be
poor
;
yet
she
pay
her
debt
and
more
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
give
her
a
quarter
's
lesson
,
and
she
have
send
me
a
quarter
's
due
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
of
what
she
deprive
herself
to
scrape
together
the
twenty
franc
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
sort
of
a
place
she
have
to
live
in
,
and
what
sort
of
a
woman
her
aunt
be
,
and
whether
she
be
likely
to
get
employment
to
supply
the
place
she
have
lose
.
<EOS>
no
doubt
she
will
have
to
trudge
about
long
enough
from
school
to
school
,
to
inquire
here
,
and
apply
there
 
be
reject
in
this
place
,
disappoint
in
that
.
<EOS>
many
an
evening
she
will
go
to
her
bed
tired
and
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
and
the
directress
would
not
let
her
in
to
bid
me
good

<EOS>
I
may
not
have
the
chance
of
stand
with
her
for
a
few
minute
at
a
window
in
the
schoolroom
and
exchange
some
half
-
dozen
of
sentence
 
get
to
know
where
she
live
 
put
matter
in

for
have
all
thing
arrange
to
my
mind

<EOS>
no
address
on
the
note

<EOS>
I
continue
,
draw
it
again
from
the
pocket
-
book
and
examine
it
on
each
side
of
the
two
leave
:
"
woman
be
woman
,
that
be
certain

and
always
do
business
like
woman

man
mechanically
put
a

and
these
five

franc
piece
?

<EOS>
(
I
haul
them
forth
from
my
purse
)
 
<EOS>
"
if
she
have
offer
me
them
herself
instead
of
tie
them
up
with
a
thread
of
green
silk
in
a
kind
of
lilliputian
packet
,
I
could
have
thrust
them
back
into
her
little
hand
,
and
shut
up
the
small
,
taper
finger
over
them
 
<EOS>
so
 
and
compel
her
shame

her
pride

her
shyness

all
to
yield
to
a
little
bit
of
determined
Will
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
how
can
I
get
at

<EOS>
open
my

I
walk
down
into
the

I
wend
my

up

<EOS>
wondrously
the
wise
for
my
inquiry

<EOS>
"
no

I
to
myself

I
again
close

"
<EOS>
no
matter
 
I
will
seek
her
through
Brussels

<EOS>
and
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
seek
her
day
by
day
whenever
I
have
a
moment
's
leisure
,
for
four
week
;
I
seek
her
on
Sundays
all
day
long
;
I
seek
her
on
the
Boulevards
,
in
the
Allee
Verte
,
in
the
Park
;
I
seek
her
in
Ste
.
<EOS>
Gudule
and
St.
Jacques
<EOS>
;
I
seek
her
in
the
two
protestant
chapel
;
I
attend
these
latter
at
the
german
,
French
,
and
english
service
,
not
doubt
that
I
should
meet
her
at
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
all
my
research
be
absolutely
fruitless
;
my
security
on
the
last
point
be
prove
by
the
event
to
be
equally
groundless
with
my
other
calculation
.
<EOS>
I
stand
at
the
door
of
each
chapel
after
the
service
,
and
wait
till
every
individual
have
come
out
,
scrutinize
every
gown
drape
a
slender
form
,
<EOS>
peer
under
every
bonnet
cover
a
young
head
.
<EOS>
in
vain
;
I
see
girlish
figure
pass
me
,
draw
their
black
scarf
over
their
sloping
shoulder
,
but
none
of
them
have
the
exact
turn
and
air
of
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Henri
's
;
I
see
pale
and
thoughtful
face
<EOS>
"
encadree
"
in
band
of
brown
hair
,
but
I
never
find
her
forehead
,
her
eye
,
her
eyebrow
.
<EOS>
all
the
feature
of
all
the
face
I
meet
seem
fritter
away
,
because
my
eye
fail
to
recognize
the
peculiarity
it
be
bent
upon
;
an
ample
space
of
brow
and
a
large
,
dark
,
and
serious
eye
,
with
a
fine
but
decide
line
of
eyebrow
trace
above

<EOS>
"
She
have
probably
leave
Brussels
 
perhaps
be
go
to
England
,
as
she
say
she
would

mutter
I
inwardly
,
<EOS>
as
on
the
afternoon
of
the
fourth
Sunday
,
I
turn
from
the
door
of
the
chapel
-
royal
which
the
door

keeper
have
just
close
and
lock
,
and
follow
in
the
wake
of
the
last
of
the
congregation

now
disperse
and
disperse
over
the
square

I
have
soon
outwalke
the

the

into
the

I

then
I

on

I
be
out

slowly
mount
the

for
the
afternoon

very
sultry

<EOS>
no
inhabitant
of
Brussels
need
wander
far
to
search
for
solitude
;
let
him
but
move
half
a
league
from
his
own
city
and
he
will
find
her
brood
still
and
blank
over
the
wide
field
,
so
drear
though
so
fertile
,
spread
out
treeless
and
trackless
round
the
capital
of
Brabant

<EOS>
have
gain
the
summit
of
the
hill
,
and
have
stand
and
look
long
over
the
cultured
but
lifeless
campaign
,
I
feel
a
wish
to
quit
the
high
road
,
which
I
have
hitherto
follow
,
and
get
in
among
those
till
ground
 
fertile
as
the
bed
of
a
brobdignagian
kitchen

garden
 
spread
far
and
wide
even

where
,
from
a
dusk
green

distance
change
them
to
a
sullen
blue

and
confuse
their
tint
with
those
of
the
livid

thunderous

looking
sky

<EOS>
accordingly
I
turn
up
a

I
have
not

just

I
turn
the

close

explain
clearly

<EOS>
the

be
large
enough
to
afford
half
an
hour

strolling
without
the
monotony
of
tread
continually
the

path
;
and
,
for
those
who
love
to
peruse
the

here
be
variety
of

enough
to
occupy
the
attention

double

that
space

<EOS>
hither
people
of
many
kindred

<EOS>
there
the
french
widower
have
shade
the
grave
of
his
Elmire
or
Celestine
with
a
brilliant
thicket
of
rose
,
amidst
which
a
little

rise

bore
an
equally
bright
testimony
to
her
countless

<EOS>
every

tribe
,
and

mourn
after
its
own
fashion

and
how
soundless
be
the
mourning
of
all

<EOS>
My
own
tread
,
though
slow
and
upon
smooth

roll
path
,
seem
to
startle
,
because
it
form
the
sole
break
to
a
silence
otherwise
total

<EOS>
not
only
the

but
the

fitful

wander
air

be
that
afternoon
,
as
by
common
consent

all
fall
asleep
in
their
various
quarter
;
the

hush

the

silent

nor

<EOS>
the
cloud
in
heaven
be
condense
and
dull
,
but
apparently
quite
motionless

<EOS>
under
the
tree
of
this
cemetery
nestle
a
warm
breathless
gloom
,
out
of
which
the
cypress
stand
up
straight
and
mute
,
above
which
the
willow
hang
low
and
still
;
where
the
flower
,
as
languid
as
fair

wait
listless
for
night
dew

thunder

shower

where
the
tomb

those

lie
impassible
to
sun

shadow
,
to
rain
or

<EOS>
importune
by
the
sound
of
my
own
footstep
,
I
turn
off
upon
the
turf
,
and
slowly
advanced
to
a
grove
of
yew
;
I
see
something
stir
among
the
stem
;
I
think
it
may
be
a
broken
branch
swinging
,
my
short

sight
vision
have
catch
no
form
,
only
a
sense
of
motion
;
but
the
dusky
shade
pass
on
,
appear
and
disappear
at
the
opening
in
the
avenue
.
<EOS>
I
soon
discern
it
be
a
living
thing
,
and
a
human
thing
;
and
,
draw
nearer
<EOS>
,
I
perceive
it
be
a
woman
,
pace
slowly
to
and
fro
,
and
evidently
deem
herself
alone
as
I
have
deem
myself
alone
,
and
meditate
as
I
have
be
meditate
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
she
return
to
a
seat
which
I
fancy
<EOS>
she
have
but
just
quit
,
or
<EOS>
I
should
have
catch
sight
of
her
before
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
a
nook
,
screen
by
a
clump
of

there
be
the
white

I
put
on
my

pass
softly
close
behind

down
at
the

sit
bent
and
thoughtful
just
under
my
eye
,
unconscious
of
the
vicinity
of
any
live
thing
;
it
be
a
slim
,
youthful
figure
in
mourn
apparel
of
the
plain
black
stuff
,
with
a
little
simple
,
black
crape
bonnet
;
I
feel
,
as
well
as
saw
,
who
it
be
;
and
,
move
neither
hand
nor
foot
,
I
stand
some
moment
enjoy
the
security
of
conviction
.
<EOS>
I
have
seek
her
for
a
month

and
have
never
discover
one
of
her
trace
 
never
meet
a
hope
,
or
seize
a
chance
of
encounter
her
anywhere
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
force
to
loosen
my
grasp
on
expectation
;
and
,
but
an
hour
ago
,
have
sink
slackly
under
the
discouraging
<EOS>
think
that
the
current
of
life
,
and
the
impulse
of
destiny
,
have
sweep
her
for
ever
from
my
reach
;
and
,
behold
,
while
bend
suddenly
earthward
beneath
the
pressure
of
despondency
 
while
follow
with
my

the
track

quiet

her

on

her

<EOS>
I
know
she
could
retain
a
thinking
attitude
a
long

without

at

,
a
tear
fall
;
she

be

at

on

her

and
her
heart
have
no

endure
one
of
those
constriction
with
which
the
desolate
living
,
regret
the
dead
,
be
,
at

so
sorely
oppress
.
<EOS>
many
tear
roll
down
,
which
she
wipe
away
,
again
and
again
,
with
her
handkerchief
;
some
distressed
sobs
escape
her
,
and
then
,
the
paroxysm
over
,
she
sit
quiet
as
before

<EOS>
I
put
my
hand
gently
on
her
shoulder
;
no
need
further
to
prepare
her
,
for
she
be
neither
hysterical
nor
liable
to
faint
-
fit
;
a
sudden
push
,
indeed
,
may
have
startle
her
,
but
the
contact
of
my
quiet
touch
merely
wake
attention
as
I
wish
;
and
,
though
she
turn
quickly
,
yet
so
lightning
-
swift

in
some

<EOS>
I
believe
the
wonder

the

have
pass
through

into

even
before

that

at

Amazement
have
hardly

hardly
discompose
her

ere
a

shine
clear

warm
on

whole
countenance

<EOS>
I
have
hardly
time
to
observe
that
she
be
waste
and
pale
,
ere
call
to
feel
a
responsive
inward
pleasure
by
the
sense
of
most
full

exquisite
pleasure
glowing
in
the
animate
flush

and
shine
in

It

I
hate
boldness

I

She

<EOS>
a
short
time

I

"
<EOS>
but
three
week
.
<EOS>
when
she
begin
to
sink
I
ask
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
's
leave
to
stay
with
her
and
wait
on
her
;
I
readily
get
leave
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
return

the
pensionnat
!
<EOS>

I
demand
hastily

<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
when
I
have
be
at
home
a
week
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
call
one
evening
,
just
after
I
have
get
my
aunt
to
bed
;
she
go
into
her
room
to
speak
to
her
,
and
be
extremely
civil
and
affable
,
as
she
always
be
;
afterwards
she
come
and
sit
with
me
a
long
time
,
and
just
as
she
rise
to
go
away
,
she
say
:
"
Mademoiselle
,
I
shall
not
soon
cease
to
regret
your
departure
from
my
establishment
,
though
indeed
it
be
true
that
you
have
teach
your
class
of
pupil
so
well
that
they
be
all
quite
accomplished
in
the
little
work
you
manage
so
skilfully
,
and
have
not
the
slight
need
of
further
instruction
;
my
second
teacher
must
in
future
supply
your
place
,
with
regard
to
the
young
pupil
,
as
well
as
she
can
,
though
she
be
indeed
an
inferior
artiste
to
you
,
and
doubtless
it
will
be
your
part
now
to
assume
a
high
position
in
your
calling
;
I
be
sure
you
will
everywhere
find
school
and
family
willing
to
profit
by
your
talent
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
then
she
pay
me
my
last
quarter
's
salary
.
<EOS>
I
ask
,
as
mademoiselle
would
no
doubt
think
,
very
bluntly
,
if
she
design
to
discharge
me
from
the
establishment
.
<EOS>
She
smile
at
my
inelegance
of
speech
,
and
answer
that
"
our
connection
as
employer
and
employ
be
certainly
dissolve
,
but
that
she
hope
still
to
retain
the
pleasure
of
my
acquaintance
;
she
should
always
be
happy
to
see
me
as
a
friend
;
"
and
then
she
say
something
about
the
excellent
condition
of
the
street
,
and
the
long
continuance
of
fine
weather
,
and
go
away
quite
cheerful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
laugh
inwardly
;
all
this
be
so
like
the
directress
 
<EOS>
so
like
what
I
have
expect
and
guess
of
her
conduct
;
and
then
the
exposure
and
proof
of
her
lie
,
unconsciously
afford
by
france
:
 
"
She
have
frequently
apply
for
Mdlle

<EOS>
Henri
's
address
,
"
forsooth
;
"
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Henri
have
always
evade
give
it
,
"
&
c.
,
&
c.
,
and
here
I
find
her
a
visitor
at
the
very
house
of
whose
locality
<EOS>
she
have
profess
absolute
ignorance
!
  
<EOS>
any
comment
I
may
have
intend
to
make
on
my
pupil
's
communication
,
be
check
by
the
plashing
of
large
rain
-
drop
on
our
face
and
on
the
path
,
and
by
the
muttering
of
a
distant
but
come
storm
.
<EOS>
the
warning
obvious
in
stagnant
air
and
leaden
sky
have
already
induce
me
to
take
the
road
lead
back
to
Brussels
,
and
now
I
hasten
my
own
step
and
those
of
my
companion
,
and
,
as
our
way
lie
downhill
,
we
get
on
rapidly
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
interval
after
the
fall
of
the
first
broad
drop
before
heavy
rain
come
on
;
in
the
meantime
we
have
pass
through
the
Porte
de
Louvain
,
and
be
again
in
the
city
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
do
you
live
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
;
"
I
will
see
you
safe
home

answer
france

<EOS>
It
be
not
far
from
the
Rue
de
Louvain
,
and
we
stand
on
the
doorstep
of
the
house
we
seek
ere
<EOS>
the
cloud
,
sever
with
loud
peal
and
shattered
cataract
of
lightning

empty
their
livid
fold
in

heavy

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
say
Frances
,
as
,
after
put
her
into
the
house
,
I
pause
ere
<EOS>
I
follow
:
the
word
decide
me
;
I
step
across
the
threshold
,
shut
the
door
on
the
rushing
,
flashing
,
whiten
storm
,
and
follow
her
upstairs
to
her
apartment
.
<EOS>
neither
she
nor
I
be
wet
;
a
projection
over
the
door
have
ward
off
the
straight
-
descend
flood
;
none
but
the
first
,
large
drop
have
touch
our
garment
;
one
minute
more
and
we
should
not
have
have
a
dry
thread
on
us
.
  
<EOS>
step
over
a
little
mat
of
green
wool
,
I
find
myself
in
a
small
room
with
a
paint
floor
and
a
square
of
green
carpet
in
the
middle
;
the
article
of
furniture
be
few
,
but
all
bright
and
exquisitely
clean
;
order
reign
through
its
narrow
limit
 
such
order
as
it
soothe
my
punctilious
soul
to
behold

<EOS>
and
I
have
hesitate
to
enter
the

because
I
apprehend
after
all
that
Mdlle

<EOS>
Reuter

about

may
be
too

I
fear
to
embarrass

by

her

unawares

<EOS>
poor
the
place
may
be
;
poor
truly
it
be
;
but
its
neatness
be
well
than
elegance
,
and
have
but
a
bright
little
fire
shone
on
that
clean
hearth
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
deem
it
more
attractive
than
a
palace
.
<EOS>
no
fire
be
there
,
however
,
and
no
fuel
lay
ready
to
light
;
the
lace

mender
be
unable
to
allow
herself
that
indulgence
,
especially
now
when
,
deprive
by
death
of
her
sole
relative
,
she
have
only
her
own
unaided
exertion
to
rely
on

<EOS>
france
go
into
an
inner
room
to
take
off
her
bonnet

and
she
come
out
a
model
of
frugal
neatness

with
her

at

the

of
inward
ruth

which
the
chill

of
that
hearth

in

quick

penetrate

quick
to
determine
,
and
quick
to
put
in
practice
,
she
have
in
a
moment
tie
a
holland
apron
round
her
waist

then
she
disappear
,
and
reappear
with
a
basket

it

a

she

and
produce
wood

deftly

compactly

"
It

<EOS>
She
have
strike

the

and
truly

when

soon
arrange
a

whose

shape

denote

<EOS>
well

everything

be
at

these

to

bring
them
with

to

and
leave
them
to
me

and

ever
since
I
be
a

I

She

she

with
a

exaltation
    
"

"

I
answer

in

there

a
sort
of
illusion
in

<EOS>
and
,
as
I
speak

a
pang

new
to
me
,
shoot
across
my
heart
:
it
be
a
pang
of
mortification
at
the
humility
of
my
position

and
the
inadequacy
of
my

while
with
that
pang

a
strong
desire

more

in

my

for
indeed
I
have
unconsciously
watch

rather
too
closely

follow
all
her

and
all
her
movement
a
little
too
perseveringly

my

for
she
mesmerize
me
by
the
grace

her
action
 
by
the
deft

cleanly

at

no

for

to
speak
truth

I
do
not
like
to
apply
to
the
directress
,
because
I
consider
she
act
neither
justly

honourably
towards
me

she
use
underhand

to
set
my
pupil
against
me

thereby
render
me
unhappy
while
I
hold
my
place

she
eventually
deprive
me

it

a
masked

hypocritical
manoeuvre

pretend

I
have
still
my

it

keep

I

not

I
leave

rather
abruptly
;
I
have
much
ado
to
resist
a
strong
inward
impulse
,
urge
me
to
take
a
warm
,
more
expressive
leave

<EOS>
what
so
natural
as
to
fold
her
for
a
moment
in
a
close
embrace
,
to
imprint
one
kiss
on
her
cheek
or
forehead
?
<EOS>
I
be
not
unreasonable
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
I
want
;
satisfied
in
that
point
,
I
could
go
away
content
;
and
Reason
deny
me
even
this

she
order
me
to
turn
my
eye
from
her
face
,
and
my
step
from
her
apartment
 
to
quit
her
as
dryly
and
coldly
as
I
would
have
quit
old
Madame
Pelet

obey

I
swear
rancorously

be
avenge
one

I
have
one
object
before

would

<EOS>
so
smile

so

not

<EOS>
would
she
sit
at

side
when
I
dictate
or
correct

with
such
a
still
,
content
,
halcyon
mien
?
<EOS>
"
for
I
have
ever
remark
,
that
however
sad
or
harass
her
countenance
may
be
when
I
enter
a
room
,
yet
after
I
have
be
near
her
,
speak
to
her
a
few
word
,
give
her
some
direction
,
utter
perhaps
some
reproofs
<EOS>
,
she
would
,
all
at
once
,
nestle
into
a
nook
of
happiness
,
and
look
up
serene
and
revive
.
<EOS>
the
reproofs
suit
her
good
of
all
:
while
I
scold
she
would
chip
away
with
her
pen
-
knife
at
a
pencil
or
a
pen
;
fidgette
a
little
,
pout
a
little
,
defend
herself
by
monosyllable
,
and
when
I
deprive
her
of
the
pen
or
pencil
,
fear
it
would
be
all
cut
away
,
and
when
I
interdict
even
the
monosyllabic
defence
,
for
the
purpose
of
work
up
the
subdue
excitement
a
little
high
,
she
would
at
last
raise
her
eye
and
give
me
a
certain
glance
,
sweeten
with
gaiety
,
and
point
with
defiance
,
which
,
to
speak
truth
,
thrill
me
as
nothing
have
ever
do
,
and
make
me
,
in
a
fashion
(
though
happily
she
do
not
know
it
)
,
her
subject
,
if
not
her
slave
.
<EOS>
after
such
little
scene
her
spirit
would
maintain
their
flow
,
often
for
some
hour
,
and
,
as
I
remark
before
,
her
health
therefrom
take
a
sustenance
and
vigour
<EOS>
which
,
previously
to
the
event
of
her
aunt
's
death
and
her
dismissal
,
have
almost
recreate
her
whole
frame
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
take
me
several
minute
to
write
these
last
sentence
;
but
I
have
think
all
their
purport
during
the
brief
interval
of
descend
the
stair
from
Frances
'
room
.
<EOS>
just
as
I
be
open
the
outer
door
,
I
remember
the
twenty
franc
which
I
have
not
restore
;
I
pause
:
impossible
to
carry
them
away
with
me
;
difficult
to
force
them
back
on
their
original
owner
;
I
have
now
see
her
in
her
own
humble
abode
,
witness
the
dignity
of
her
poverty
,
the
pride
of
order
,
the
fastidious
care
of
conservatism
,
obvious
in
the
arrangement
and
economy
of
her
little
home
;
I
be
sure
she
would
not
suffer
herself
to
be
excuse
pay
her
debt
;
I
be
certain
the
favour
of
indemnity
would
be
accept
from
no
hand
,
perhaps
least
of
all
from
mine
:
yet
these
four
five
-
franc
piece
be
a
burden
to
my
self
-
respect
,
and
I
must
get
rid
of
them
.
<EOS>
an
expedient
 
a
clumsy
one
no
doubt
,
but
the
good
I
could
devise
-
suggest
itself
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
dart
up
the
stair
,
knock
,
re
-
enter
the
room
as
if
in
haste
:
    
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
,
I
have
forget
one
of
my
glove
;
I
must
have
leave
it
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
instantly
rise
to
seek
it
;
as
she
turn
her
back
,
I
 
be
now
at
the
hearth
 
noiselessly
lift
a
little
vase
,
one
of
a
set
of
china
ornament
,
as
old
-
fashioned
as
the
tea
-
cup
 
slip
the
money
under
it
,
then
say
 
"
oh
here
be
my
glove
!
<EOS>
I
have
drop
it
within
the
fender
;
good
evening
,
mademoiselle
,
<EOS>

I
make
my
second
exit
.
  
<EOS>
Brief
<EOS>
as
my
impromptu
return
have
be
,
it
have
afford
me
time
to
pick
up
a
heart
-
ache
;
I
remark
that
Frances
have
already
remove
the
red
ember
of
her
cheerful
little
fire
from
the
grate
:
<EOS>
force
to
calculate
every
item
,
to
save
in
every
detail
,
she
have
instantly
on
my
departure
retrench
a
luxury
too
expensive
to
be
enjoy
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
it
be
not
yet
winter
,
"
think
I
;
"
but
in
two
month
more
come
the
wind
and
rain
of
November
;
would
to
God
that
before
then
I
could
earn
the
right
,
and
the
power
,
to
shovel
coal
into
that
grate

<EOS>
already
the
pavement
be
dry
;
a
balmy
and
fresh
breeze
stir
the
air
,
purify
by
lightning
;
I
feel
the
West
behind
me
,
where
spread
a
sky
like
opal
;
azure
immingle
with
crimson
:
the
enlarge
sun

glorious
in
tyrian
tint

dip
his
brim
already

step
,
as
I
be
,
eastward
<EOS>
,
I
face
a
vast
bank
of
cloud
,
but
also
I
have
before
me
the
arch
of
an
evening
rainbow
;
<EOS>
a
perfect
rainbow
 
high
,
wide
,
vivid
.
<EOS>
I
look
long
;
my
eye
drink
in
the
scene
,
and
I
suppose
my
brain
must
have
absorb
it
;
for
that
night
,
after
lie
awake
in
pleasant
fever
a
long
time
,
watch
the
silent
sheet
-
lightning
,
which
still
play
among
the
retreat
cloud
,
and
flash
silvery
over
the
star

I
at
last
fall
asleep
;
and
then
in
a
dream
be
reproduce
the
set
sun
,
the
bank
of
cloud
,
the
mighty
rainbow
.
<EOS>
I
stand
,
methought
,
on
a
terrace
;
I
lean
over
a
parapeted
wall
;
there
be
space
below
me
,
depth
I
could
not
fathom
,
but
hear
an
endless
dash
of
wave
,
I
believe
it
to
be
the
sea
;
sea
spread
to
the
horizon
;
sea
of
changeful
green
and
intense
blue
:
all
be
soft
in
the
distance
;
all
vapour

veil

the

midway

the
rainbow

the
soft

dusk
cloud

fleecy

like

and
even
that
sum
I

hold

a
very
precarious
tenure

<EOS>
It
be
some
time
since
I
make
any
reference
to
M.
Pelet
.
<EOS>
the
moonlight
walk
be
,
I
think
,
the
last
incident
record
in
this
narrative
where
that
gentleman
cut
any
conspicuous
figure
:
the
fact
be
,
since
that
event
,
a
change
have
come
over
the
spirit
of
our
intercourse
.
<EOS>
He
,
indeed
,
ignorant
that
the
still
hour
,
a
cloudless
moon
,
and
an
open
lattice
,
have
reveal
to
me
the
secret
of
his
selfish
love
and
false
friendship
,
would
have
continue
smooth
and
complaisant
as
ever
;
but
I
grow
spiny
as
a
porcupine
,
and
inflexible
as
a
blackthorn
cudgel
;
I
never
have
a
smile
for
his
raillery
,
never
a
moment
for
his
society
;
his
invitation
to
take
coffee
with
him
in
his
parlour
be
invariably
reject
,
and
very
stiffly
and
sternly
reject
too
;
his
jest
allusion
to
the
directress
(
which
he
still
continue
)
be
hear
with
a
grim
calm
very
different
from
the
petulant
pleasure
they
be
formerly
will
not
to
excite
.
<EOS>
for
a
long
time
Pelet
bear
with
my
frigid
demeanour
very
patiently
;
he
even
increase
his
attention
;
but
find
that
even
a
cringe
politeness
fail
to
thaw
or
move
me
,
he
at
last
alter
too
;
in
his
turn
he
cool
;
his
invitation
cease
;
his
countenance
become
suspicious
and
overcast
,
and
I
read
in
the
perplexed
yet
brood
aspect
of
his
brow
,
a
constant
examination
and
comparison
of
premise
,
and
an
anxious
endeavour
to
draw
thence
some
explanatory
inference
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
I
fancy
,
he
succeed
,
for
he
be
not
without
penetration
;
perhaps
,
too
,
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Zoraide
may
have
aid
him
in
the
solution
of
the
enigma
;
at
any
rate
I
soon
find
that
the
uncertainty
of
doubt
have
vanish
from
his
manner
;
renounce
all
pretence
of
friendship
and
cordiality
,
he
adopt
a
reserved
,
formal
,
but
still
scrupulously
polite
deportment
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
point
to
which
I
have
wish
to
bring
him
,
and
I
be
now
again
comparatively
at
my
ease
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
,
it
be
true
,
like
my
position
in
his
house
;
but
be
free
from
the
annoyance
of
false
profession
and
double
-
deal
I
could
endure
it
,
especially
as
no
heroic
sentiment
of
hatred
or
jealousy
of
the
director
distract
my
philosophical
soul
<EOS>
;
he
have
not
,
I
find
,
wound
me
in
a
very
tender
point
,
the
wound
be
so
soon
and
so
radically
heal
,
leave
only
a
sense
of
contempt
for
the
treacherous
fashion
in
which
it
have
be
inflict
,
and
a
last
mistrust
of
the
hand
which
I
have
detect
attempt
to
stab
in
the
dark
.
  
<EOS>
this
state
of
thing
continue
till
about
the
middle
of
July
,
and
then
there
be
a
little
change
;
Pelet
come
home
one
night
,
an
hour
after
his
usual
time
,
in
a
state
of
unequivocal
intoxication
,
a
thing
anomalous
with
him
;
for
if
he
have
some
of
the
bad
fault
of
his
countryman
,
he
have
also
one
at
least
of
their
virtue
,
i.e.
sobriety
.
<EOS>
so
drunk
,
however
,
be
he
upon
this
occasion

that
after
have
rouse

by
violently
ring
the

bring
in
immediately

for
he
imagine
it
be
noon

whereas
the

have
just
toll
midnight

after
have
furiously
rate
the

and
go
near
to
chastise
his
poor
old
mother

yet
retire
;
some
german
book
I
have
get
hold
of
have
keep
me
up
late
;
I
hear
the
uproar
below
,
and
could
distinguish
the
director
's
voice
exalt
in
a
manner
as
appalling
as
it
be
unusual
.
<EOS>
open
my
door
a
little
,
I
become
aware
of
a
demand
on
his
part
for
"
Creemsvort
"
to
be
bring
down
to
him
that
he
may
cut
his
throat
on
the
hall
-
table
and
wash
his
honour
,
which
he
affirm
to
be
in
a
dirty
condition
,
in
infernal
british
blood
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
either
mad
or
drunk
,
"
think
I
,
"
and
in
either
case
the
old
woman
and
the
servant
will
be
the
well
of
a
man
's
assistance
,
"
<EOS>
so
I
descend
straight
to
the
hall
.
<EOS>
I
find
him
stagger
about
,
his
eye
in
a
fine
frenzy
roll
 
a
pretty
sight
he
be
,
a
just
medium
between
the
fool
and
the
lunatic
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
M.
Pelet
,
"
say
I
,
"
you
have
better
go
to
bed
,
"
and
I
take
hold
of
his
arm
.
<EOS>
His
excitement
,
of
course
,
increase
greatly
at
sight
and
touch
of
the
individual
for
whose
blood
he
have
be
make
application
:
he
struggle
and
strike
with
fury
 
but
<EOS>
a
drunken
man
be
no
match
for
a
sober
one
;
and
,
even
in
his
normal
state
,
Pelet
's
wear
out
frame
could
not
have
stand
against
my
sound
one
.
<EOS>
I
get
him
up
-
stair
,
and
,
in
process
of
time
,
to
bed
.
<EOS>
during
the
operation
he
do
not
fail
to
utter
commination
which
,
though
break
,
have
a
sense
in
them
;
while
stigmatize
me
as
the
treacherous
spawn
of
a
perfidious
country
,
he
,
in
the
same
breath
,
anathematize
Zoraide
Reuter
;
he
term
her
"
femme
sotte
et
vicieuse
,
"
who
,
in
a
fit
of
lewd
caprice
,
have
throw
herself
away
on
an
unprincipled
adventurer
;
direct
the
point
of
the
last
appellation
by
a
furious
blow
,
obliquely
aim
at
me
.
<EOS>
I
leave
him
in
the
act
of
bound
elastically
out
of
the
bed
into
which
I
have
tuck
him
;
but
,
as
I
take
the
precaution
of
turn
the
key
in
the
door
behind
me
,
I
retire
to
my
own
room
,
assure
of
his
safe
custody
till
the
morning
,
and
free
to
draw
undisturbed
conclusion
from
the
scene
I
have
just
witness
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
it
be
precisely
about
this
time
that
the
directress
,
sting
by
my
coldness
,
bewitch
by
my
scorn
,
and
excite
by
the
preference
she
suspect
me
of
cherish
for
another
,
have
fall
into
a
snare
of
her
own
lay
 
<EOS>
be
herself
catch
in
the
mesh
of
the
very
passion
with
which
she
wish
to
entangle
me
.
<EOS>
conscious
of
the
state
of
thing
in
that
quarter
<EOS>
,
I
gather
,
from
the
condition
in
which
I
see
my
employer
,
that
his
lady
-
love
have
betray
the
alienation
of
her
affection
 
inclination
,
rather
,
I
would
say
;
affection
be
a
word
at
once
too
warm
and
too
pure
for
the
subject
 
<EOS>
have
let
him
see
that
the
cavity
of
her
hollow
heart
,
empty
of
his
image
,
be
now
occupy
by
that
of
his
usher
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
without
some
surprise
that
I
find
myself
oblige
to
entertain
this
view
of
the
case
;
Pelet
,
with
his
old
-
establish
school
,
be
so
convenient
,
so
profitable
a
match
 
<EOS>
Zoraide
be
so
calculate
,
so
interested
a
woman
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
mere
personal
preference
could
,
in
her
mind
,
have
prevail
for
a
moment
over
worldly
advantage
:
<EOS>
yet
,
it
be
evident
,
from
what
Pelet
say
,
that
,
not
only
have
she
repulse
him
,
but
have
even
let
slip
expression
of
partiality
for
me
.
<EOS>
one
of
his
drunken
exclamation
be
,
"
and
the
jade
doat
on
your
youth
,
you
raw
blockhead
!
<EOS>
and
talk
of
your
noble
deportment
,
as
she
call
your
accurse
english
formality
 
and
your
pure
moral
,
forsooth
!
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
her
,
I
think
,
must
be
a
curious
soul
,
where
in
spite
of
a
strong
,
natural
tendency
to
estimate
unduly
advantage
of
wealth
and
station
,
the
sardonic
disdain
of
a
fortuneless
subordinate
have
work
a
deep
impression
than
could
be
imprint
by
the
most
flattering
assiduity
of
a
prosperous
chef
D'INSTITUTION
.
<EOS>
I
smile
inwardly
;
and
strange
to
say
,
though
my
AMOUR
PROPRE
be
excite
not
disagreeably
by
the
conquest
,
my
well
feeling
remain
untouched
.
<EOS>
next
day
,
when
I
see
the
directress
,
and
when
she
make
an
excuse
to
meet
me
in
the
corridor
,
and
besought
my
notice
by
a
demeanour
and
look
subdue
to
Helot
humility
,
I
could
not
love
,
I
could
scarcely
pity
her
.
<EOS>
to
answer
briefly
and
dryly
some
interesting
inquiry
about
my
health
 
to
pass
her
by
with
a
stern
bow
 
be
all
I
could
;
her
presence
and
manner
have
then
,
and
for
some
time
previously
and
consequently
,
a
singular
effect
upon
me
:
they
seal
up
all
that
be
good
<EOS>
elicit
all
that
be
noxious
in
my
nature
;
sometimes
they
enervate
my
sense
,
but
they
always
harden
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
be
aware
of
the
detriment
do
,
and
quarrel
with
myself
for
the
change
.
<EOS>
I
have
ever
hate
a
tyrant
;
and
,
behold
,
the
possession
of
a
slave
,
self
-
give
,
go
near
to
transform
me
into
what
I
abhor
!
<EOS>
there
be
at
once
a
sort
of
low
gratification
in
receive
this
luscious
incense
from
an
attractive
and
still
young
worshipper
;
and
an
irritating
sense
of
degradation
in
the
very
experience
of
the
pleasure
.
<EOS>
when
she
steal
about
me
with
the
soft
step
of
a
slave
,
I
feel
at
once
barbarous
and
sensual
as
a
pasha
.
<EOS>
I
endure
her
homage
sometimes
;
sometimes
I
rebuke
it
.
<EOS>
My
indifference
or
harshness
serve
equally
to
increase
the
evil
I
desire
to
check
.
  
<EOS>
"
Que
le
dedain

bien
!
<EOS>
"
I
once
overhear
her
say
to
her
mother
:
"
il
est
beau
comme
<EOS>
Apollon
quand
il
sourit
de
son
air
hautain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
the
jolly
old
dame
laugh
,
and
say
she
think
her
daughter
be
bewitch
<EOS>
,
for
I
have
no
point
of
a
handsome
man
about
me
,
except
be
straight
and
without
deformity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>

she
continue
,
"

<EOS>
worthy
old
girl
!
<EOS>
I
could
have
go
and
kiss
her
<EOS>
have
she
not
be
a
little
too
old
,
too
fat
,
and
too
red
-
face
;
her
sensible
,
truthful
word
seem
so
wholesome
,
contrast
with
the
morbid
illusion
of
her
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
when
Pelet
awake
on
the
morning
after
his
frenzy
fit
,
he
retain
no
recollection
of
what
have
happen
the
previous
night
,
and
his
mother
fortunately
have
the
discretion
to
refrain
from
inform
him
that
I
have
be
a
witness
of
his
degradation
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
again
have
recourse
to
wine
for
cure
his
griefs
,
but
even
in
his
sober
mood
he
soon
show
that
the
iron
of
jealousy
have
enter
into
his
soul
.
<EOS>
a
thorough
Frenchman
,
the
national
characteristic
of
ferocity
have
not
be
omit
by
nature
in
compound
the
ingredient
of
his
character
;
it
have
appear
first
in
his
access
of
drunken
wrath
,
when
some
of
his
demonstration
of
hatred
to
my
person
be
of
a
truly
fiendish
character
,
and
now
it
be
more
covertly
betray
by
momentary
contraction
of
the
feature
,
and
flash
of
fierceness
in
his
light
blue
eye
,
when
their
glance
chance
to
encounter
mine
.
<EOS>
He
absolutely
avoid
speak
to
me
;
I
be
now
spare
even
the
falsehood
of
his
politeness
.
<EOS>
in
this
state
of
our
mutual
relation
,
my
soul
rebel
sometimes
almost
ungovernably
,
against
live
in
the
house
and
discharge
the
service
of
such
a
man
;
but
who
be
free
from
the
constraint
of
circumstance
?
<EOS>
at
that
time
,
I
be
not
:
I
use
to
rise
each
morning
eager
to
shake
off
his
yoke
,
and
go
out
with
my
portmanteau
under
my
arm
,
if
a
beggar
,
at
least
a
freeman
;
and
in
the
evening
,
when
I
come
back
from
the
pensionnat
de
demoiselles
,
a
certain
pleasant
voice
in
my
ear
;
a
certain
face
,
so
intelligent
,
yet
so
docile
,
so
reflective
,
yet
so
soft
,
in
my
eye
;
a
certain
cast
of
character
,
at
once
proud
and
pliant
,
sensitive
and
sagacious
,
serious
and
ardent
,
in
my
head
;
a
certain
tone
of
feeling
,
fervid
and
modest
,
refined
and
practical
,
pure
and
powerful
,
delight
and
trouble
my
memory
 
vision
of
new
tie
I
long
to
contract
,
of
new
duty
I
long
to
undertake
,
have
take
the
rover
and
the
rebel
out
of
me
,
and
have
show
endurance
of
my
hate
lot
in
the
light
of
a
spartan
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
but
Pelet
's
fury
subside
;
a
fortnight
suffice
for
its
rise
,
progress
,
and
extinction
:
in
that
space
of
time
the
dismissal
of
the
obnoxious
teacher
have
be
effect
in
the
neighbouring
house
,
and
in
the
same
interval
I
have
declare
my
resolution
to
follow
and
find
out
my
pupil
,
and
upon
my
application
for
her
address
be
refuse
,
I
have
summarily
resign
my
own
post
.
<EOS>
this
last
act
seem
at
once
to
restore
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
reuter
to
her
sense
;
her
sagacity
,
her
judgment
,
so
long
mislead
by
a
fascinating
delusion
,
strike
again
into
the
right
track
the
moment
that
delusion
vanish
.
<EOS>
by
the
right
track
,
I
do
not
mean
the
steep
and
difficult
path
of
principle
 
in
that
path
she
never
tread
;
but
the
plain
highway
of
common
sense
,
from
which
she
have
of
late
widely
diverge
.
<EOS>
when
there
she
carefully
seek
,
and
have
find
,
industriously
pursue
the
trail
of
her
old
suitor
,
M.
Pelet
.
<EOS>
She
soon
overtook
him
.
<EOS>
what
art
she
employ
to
soothe
and
blind
him
<EOS>
I
know
not
,
but
she
succeed
both
in
allay
his
wrath
,
and
hoodwink
his
discernment
,
as
be
soon
prove
by
the
alteration
in
his
mien
and
manner
;
she
must
have
manage
to
convince
him
that
I
neither
be
,
nor
ever
have
be
,
a
rival
of
his
,
for
the
fortnight
of
fury
against
me
terminate
in
a
fit
of
exceed
graciousness
and
amenity
,
not
unmixed
with
a
dash
of
exult
self
-
complacency
,
more
ludicrous
than
irritate
.
<EOS>
Pelet
's
bachelor
's
life
have
be
pass
in
proper
french
style
with
due
disregard
to
moral
restraint
,
and
I
think
his
marry
life
promise
to
be
very
french
also
.
<EOS>
He
often
boast
to
me
what
a
terror
he
have
be
to
certain
husband
of
his
acquaintance
;
I
perceive
it
would
not
now
be
difficult
to
pay
him
back
in
his
own
coin
.
  
<EOS>
the
crisis
draw
on
.
<EOS>
no
sooner
have
the
holiday
commence
than
note
of
preparation
for
some
momentous
event
sound
all
through
the
premise
of
Pelet
:
painter
,
polisher
,
and
upholsterer
be
immediately
set
to
work
,
and
there
be
talk
of
"
la
chambre
de
Madame
,
"
"
le
salon
de
Madame
.
"
<EOS>
not
deem
it
probable
that
the
old
duenna
at
present
grace
with
that
title
in
our
house
,
have
inspire
her
son
with
such
enthusiasm
of
filial
piety
,
as
to
induce
him
to
fit
up
apartment
expressly
for
her
use
,
I
conclude
,
in
common
with
the
cook
,
the
two
housemaid
,
and
the
kitchen
-
scullion
,
that
a
new
and
more
juvenile
Madame
be
destine
to
be
the
tenant
of
these
gay
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
presently
official
announcement
of
the
come
event
be
put
forth
.
<EOS>
in
another
week
's
time
M.
Francois
Pelet
,
directeur
,
and
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Zoraide
Reuter
,
directrice
,
be
to
be
join
together
in
the
band
of
matrimony
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
,
in
person
,
herald
the
fact
to
me
;
terminate
his
communication
by
an
obliging
expression
of
his
desire
that
I
should
continue
,
as
heretofore
,
his
able
assistant
and
most
trust
friend
;
and
a
proposition
to
raise
my
salary
by
an
additional
two
hundred
franc
per
annum
.
<EOS>
I
thank
him
,
give
no
conclusive
answer
at
the
time
,
and
,
when
he
have
leave
me
,
throw
off
my
blouse
,
put
on
my
coat
,
and
set
out
on
a
long
walk
outside
the
Porte
de
Flandre
,
in
order
,
as
I
think
,
to
cool
my
blood
,
calm
my
nerve
,
and
shake
my
disarranged
idea
into
some
order
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
I
have
just
receive
what
be
virtually
my
dismissal
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
conceal
,
I
do
not
desire
to
conceal
from
myself
the
conviction
that
,
be
now
certain
that
Mdlle
.
<EOS>
Reuter
be
destine
to
become
Madame
Pelet
<EOS>
it
would
not
do
for
me
to
remain
a
dependent
dweller
in
the
house
which
be
soon
to
be
hers
.
<EOS>
Her
present
demeanour
towards
me
be
deficient
neither
in
dignity
nor
propriety
;
but
I
know
her
former
feeling
be
unchanged
.
<EOS>
Decorum
now
repress
,
and
Policy
mask
it
,
but
opportunity
would
be
too
strong
for
either
of
these
 
Temptation
would
shiver
their
restraint
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
no
pope
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
boast
infallibility
:
in
short
,
if
I
stay
,
the
probability
be
that
,
in
three
month
'
time
,
a
practical
modern
french
novel
would
be
in
full
process
of
concoction
under
the
roof
of
the
unsuspecting
Pelet
.
<EOS>
now
,
modern
french
novel
be
not
to
my
taste
,
either
practically
or
theoretically
.
<EOS>
Limited
as
have
yet
be
my
experience
of
life
,
I
have
once
have
the
opportunity
of
contemplating
,
near
at
hand
,
an
example
of
the
result
produce
by
a
course
of
interesting
and
romantic
domestic
treachery
.
<EOS>
no
golden
halo
of
fiction
be
about
this
example
,
I
see
it
bare
and
real
,
and
it
be
very
loathsome
.
<EOS>
I
see
a
mind
degrade
by
the
practice
of
mean
subterfuge
,
by
the
habit
of
perfidious
deception
,
and
a
body
deprave
by
the
infectious
influence
of
the
vice
-
polluted
soul
.
<EOS>
I
have
suffer
much
from
the
force
and
prolonged
view
of
this
spectacle
;
those
suffering
I
do
not
now
regret
,
for
their
simple
recollection
act
as
a
most
wholesome
antidote
to
temptation
.
<EOS>
They
have
inscribe
on
my
reason
the
conviction
that
unlawful
pleasure
,
trench
on
another
's
right
,
be
delusive
and
envenomed
pleasure
 
its
hollowness
disappoint
at
the
time
,
its
poison
cruelly
torture
afterwards
,
its
effect
deprave
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
from
all
this
result
the
conclusion
that
I
must
leave
Pelet
's
,
and
that
instantly
;
"
but
,
"
say
Prudence
,
"
you
know
not
where
to
go
,
nor
how
to
live
;
"
and
then
the
dream
of
true
love
come
over
me
:
Frances
Henri
seem
to
stand
at
my
side
;
her
slender
waist
to
invite
my
arm
;
her
hand
to
court
my
hand
;
I
feel
it
be
make
to
nestle
in
mine
;
I
could
not
relinquish
my
right
to
it
,
nor
could
I
withdraw
my
eye
for
ever
from
her
,
where
I
see
so
much
happiness
,
such
a
correspondence
of
heart
with
heart
;
over
whose
expression
I
have
such
influence
;
where
I
could
kindle
bliss
,
infuse
awe
,
stir
deep
delight
,
rouse
sparkling
spirit
,
and
sometimes
waken
pleasurable
dread
.
<EOS>
My
hope
to
will
and
possess
,
my
resolution
to
merit
and
rise
,
rise
in
array
against
me
;
and
here
I
be
about
to
plunge
into
the
gulf
of
absolute
destitution
;
"
and
all
this
,
"
suggest
an
inward
voice
,
"
because
you
fear
an
evil
which
may
never
happen
!
"
<EOS>
"
It
will
happen
;
you
know
it
will
,
"
answer
that
stubborn
monitor
,
Conscience
.
<EOS>
"
do
what
you
feel
be
right
;
obey
me
,
and
even
in
the
slough
of
want
I
will
plant
for
you
firm
footing
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
as
I
walk
fast
along
the
road
,
there
rise
upon
me
a
strange
,
inly
-
feel
idea
of
some
great
Being
,
unseen
,
but
all
present
,
who
in
His
beneficence
desire
only
my
welfare
,
and
now
watch
the
struggle
of
good
and
evil
in
my
heart
,
and
wait
to
see
whether
I
should
obey
His
voice
,
hear
in
the
whisper
of
my
conscience
,
or
lend
an
ear
to
the
sophism
by
which
His
enemy
and
mine
 
the
Spirit
of
Evil
 
seek
to
lead
me
astray
.
<EOS>
rough
and
steep
be
the
path
indicate
by
divine
suggestion
;
mossy
and
decline
the
green
way
along
which
Temptation
strew
flower
;
but
whereas
,
methought
,
the
Deity
of
Love
,
the
friend
of
all
that
exist
,
would
smile
well
-
pleased
be
I
to
gird
up
my
loin
and
address
myself
to
the
rude
ascent
;
so
,
on
the
other
hand
,
each
inclination
to
the
velvet
declivity
seem
to
kindle
a
gleam
of
triumph
on
the
brow
of
the
man
-
hate
,
God
-
defy
demon
.
<EOS>
sharp
and
short
<EOS>
I
turn
round
;
fast
I
retrace
my
step
;
in
half
an
hour
I
be
again
at
M.
Pelet
's
:
I
seek
him
in
his
study
;
brief
parley
,
concise
explanation
suffice
;
my
manner
prove
that
I
be
resolve
;
he
,
perhaps
,
at
heart
approve
my
decision
.
<EOS>
after
twenty
minute
'
conversation
,
I
re
-
enter
my
own
room
,
self
-
deprive
of
the
mean
of
living
,
self
-
sentence
to
leave
my
present
home
,
with
the
short
notice
of
a
week
in
which
to
provide
another
.
    
<EOS>
DIRECTLY
as
I
close
the
door
<EOS>
,
I
see
lay
on
the
table
two
letter
<EOS>
;
my
thought
be
,
that
they
be
note
of
invitation
from
the
friend
of
some
of
my
pupil
;
I
have
receive
such
mark
of
attention
occasionally
,
and
with
me
,
who
have
no
friend
,
correspondence
of
more
interest
be
out
of
the
question
;
the
postman
's
arrival
have
never
yet
be
an
event
of
interest
to
me
since
I
come
to
Brussels
.
<EOS>
I
lay
my
hand
carelessly
on
the
document
,
and
coldly
and
slowly
glance
at
them
<EOS>
,
I
prepare
to
break
the
seal
;
my
eye
be
arrest
and
my
hand
too
;
I
see
what
excite
me
,
as
if
I
have
find
a
vivid
picture
where
I
expect
only
to
discover
a
blank
page
:
on
one
cover
be
an
English
postmark
;
on
the
other
,
a
lady
's
clear
,
fine
autograph
;
the
last
I
open
first
:
    
"
MONSIEUR
,
  
<EOS>
"
I
find
out
what
you
have
do
the
very
morning
after
your
visit
to
me
;
you
may
be
sure
I
should
dust
the
china
,
every
day
;
and
,
as
no
one
<EOS>
but
you
have
be
in
my
room
for
a
week
,
and
as
fairy
-
money
be
not
current
in
Brussels
,
I
could
not
doubt
who
leave
the
twenty
franc
on
the
chimney
-
piece
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
hear
you
stir
the
vase
when
I
be
stoop
to
look
for
your
glove
under
the
table
,
and
I
wonder
you
should
imagine
it
have
get
into
such
a
little
cup
.
<EOS>
now
,
monsieur
,
the
money
be
not
mine
,
and
I
shall
not
keep
it
;
I
will
not
send
it
in
this
note
because
it
may
be
lose
 
besides
,
it
be
heavy
;
but
I
will
restore
it
to
you
the
first
time
I
see
you
,
and
you
must
make
no
difficulty
about
take
it
;
<EOS>
because
,
in
the
first
place
,
I
be
sure
,
monsieur
,
you
can
understand
that
one
like
to
pay
one
's
debt
;
that
it
be
satisfactory
to
owe
no
man
anything
;
and
,
in
the
second
place
,
I
can
now
very
well
afford
to
be
honest
,
as
I
be
provide
with
a
situation
.
<EOS>
this
last
circumstance
be
,
indeed
,
the
reason
of
my
writing
to
you
,
for
it
be
pleasant
to
communicate
good
news
;
and
,
in
these
day
,
I
have
only
my
master
to
whom
I
can
tell
anything
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
week
ago
,
monsieur
,
I
be
send
for
by
a
Mrs.
Wharton
,
an
english
lady
;
her
eld
daughter
be
go
to
be
married
,
and
some
rich
relation
have
make
her
a
present
of
a
veil
and
dress
in
costly
old
lace
,
as
precious
,
they
say
,
almost
as
jewel
,
but
a
little
damage
by
time
,
I
be
commission
to
put
them
in
repair
.
<EOS>
I
have
to
do
it
at
the
house
;
they
give
me
,
besides
,
some
embroidery
to
complete
,
and
nearly
a
week
elapse
before
I
have
finish
everything
.
<EOS>
while
I
work
,
Miss
Wharton
often
come
into
the
room
and
sit
with
me
,
and
so
do
Mrs.
Wharton
<EOS>
;
they
make
me
talk
English
;
ask
how
I
have
learn
to
speak
it
so
well
;
then
they
inquire
what
I
know
besides
 
what
book
I
have
read
;
soon
they
seem
to
make
a
sort
of
wonder
of
me
,
consider
me
no
doubt
as
a
learned
grisette
.
<EOS>
one
afternoon
,
Mrs.
Wharton
bring
in
a
parisian
lady
to
test
the
accuracy
of
my
knowledge
of
French
;
the
result
of
it
be
that
,
owe
probably
in
a
great
degree
to
the
mother
's
and
daughter
's
good
humour
about
the
marriage
,
which
incline
them
to
do
beneficent
deed
,
and
partly
,
I
think
,
because
they
be
naturally
benevolent
people
,
they
decide
that
the
wish
I
have
express
to
do
something
more
than
mend
lace
be
a
very
legitimate
one
;
and
the
same
day
they
take
me
in
their
carriage
to
Mrs.
d."s
,
who
be
the
directress
of
the
first
english
school
at
Brussels
.
<EOS>
It
seem
she
happen
to
be
in
want
of
a
french
lady
to
give
lesson
in
geography
,
history
,
grammar
,
and
composition
,
in
the
french
language
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wharton
recommend
me
very
warmly
;
and
,
as
two
of
her
young
daughter
be
pupil
in
the
house
,
her
patronage
avail
to
get
me
the
place
.
<EOS>
It
be
settle
that
I
be
to
attend
six
hour
daily
(
for
,
happily
<EOS>
,
it
be
not
require
that
I
should
live
in
the
house
;
I
should
have
be
sorry
to
leave
my
lodging
)
,
and
,
for
this
,
Mrs.
D.
will
give
me
twelve
hundred
franc
per
annum
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
therefore
,
monsieur
,
that
I
be
now
rich
;
richer
almost
than
I
ever
hope
to
be
:
I
feel
thankful
for
it
,
especially
as
my
sight
be
begin
to
be
injure
by
constant
work
at
fine
lace
;
and
I
be
get
,
too
,
very
weary
of
sit
up
late
at
night
,
and
yet
not
be
able
to
find
time
for
reading
or
study
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
fear
that
I
should
fall
ill
,
and
be
unable
to
pay
my
way
;
this
fear
be
now
,
in
a
great
measure
,
remove
;
and
,
in
truth
,
monsieur
,
I
be
very
grateful
to
God
for
the
relief
;
and
I
feel
it
necessary
,
almost
,
to
speak
of
my
happiness
to
some
one
who
be
kind
-
hearted
enough
to
derive
joy
from
see
other
joyful
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
,
therefore
,
resist
the
temptation
of
write
to
you
;
I
argue
with
myself
it
be
very
pleasant
for
me
to
write
,
and
it
will
not
be
exactly
painful
,
though
it
may
be
tiresome
to
monsieur
to
read
.
<EOS>
do
not
be
too
angry
with
my
circumlocution
and
inelegancie
of
expression
,
and
,
believe
me

Your

pupil

F.
E.
HENRI

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
have
read
this
letter
,
I
muse
on
its
content
for
a
few
moment
 
whether
with
sentiment
pleasurable
or
<EOS>
otherwise
I
will
hereafter
note
 
and
then
take
up
the
other
.
<EOS>
It
be
direct
in
a
hand
to
me
unknown
 
small
,
and
rather
neat
;
neither
masculine
nor
exactly
feminine
;
the
seal
bear
a
coat
of
arm
,
concern
which
I
could
only
decipher
that
it
be
not
that
of
the
Seacombe
family
<EOS>
,
consequently
the
epistle
could
be
from
none
of
my
almost
forget
,
and
certainly
quite
forget
patrician
relation
.
<EOS>
from
whom
,
then
,
be
it
?
<EOS>
I
remove
the
envelope
;
the
note
fold
within
run
as
follow
:
  
"
I
have
no
doubt
in
the
world
that
you
be
do
well
in
that
greasy
flander
;
live
probably
on
the
fat
of
the
unctuous
land
;
sit
like
a
black
-
haired
,
tawny
-
skinned
,
long
-
nosed
Israelite
by
the
flesh
-
pot
of
Egypt
;
or
like
a
rascally
son
of
Levi
near
the
brass
cauldron
of
the
sanctuary
,
and
every
now
and
then
plunge
in
a
consecrated
hook
,
and
draw
out
of
the
sea
of
broth
the
fat
of
heave
-
shoulder
and
the
fleshy
of
wave
-
breast
.
<EOS>
I
know
this
,
because
you
never
write
to
any
one
in
England
.
<EOS>
thankless
dog
that
you
be
!
<EOS>
I
,
by
the
sovereign
efficacy
of
my
recommendation
,
get
you
the
place
where
you
be
now
live
in
clover
,
and
yet
not
a
word
of
gratitude
,
or
even
acknowledgment
,
have
you
ever
offer
in
return

but
I
be
come
to
see
you

and
small
conception
can
you
,
with
your
addle
aristocratic

form

I
have

ready
packed
in
my
carpet

destine
to
be
present
to
you
immediately
on
my
arrival

<EOS>
"
meantime
I
know
all
about
your
affair
,
and
have
just
get
information
,
by
Brown
's
last
letter
,
that
you
be

her
when
I
come
over

<EOS>
and
this
you
may
rely
on
:
if
she
please
my
taste

or
if
I
think
it
worth

in
a
pecuniary
point
of
view
,
I
will
pounce
on
your
prize

bear
her
away
triumphant
in

your
tooth

<EOS>
yet
I
do
not
like
dumpie
either

Brown
say
she

out

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
<EOS>
"
say
I
;
and
ere
I
lay
the
letter
down
<EOS>
,
I
again
glance
at
the
small
,
neat
handwriting
,
not
a
bit
like
that
of
a
mercantile
man
,
nor
,
indeed
,
of
any
man
except
Hunsden
himself
.
<EOS>
They
talk
of
affinity
between
the
autograph
and
the
character
:
what
affinity
be
there
here
?
<EOS>
I
recall
the
writer
's
peculiar
face
and
certain
trait
I
suspect
,
rather
than
know
,
to
appertain
to
his
nature
,
and
I
answer
,
"
a
great
deal
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hunsden
,
then
,
be
come
to
Brussels
,
and
come
<EOS>
I
know
not
when
;
come
charge
with
the
expectation
of
find
me
on
the
summit
of
prosperity
,
about
to
be
marry
,
to
step
into
a
warm
nest
,
to
lie
comfortably
down
by
the
side
of
a
snug
,
well
-
feed
little
mate
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
him
joy
of
the
fidelity
of
the
picture
he
have
paint
,
"
think
I.
"
<EOS>
what
will
he
say
when
,
instead
of
a
pair
of
plump
turtle
dove
,
billing
and
cooing
in
a
bower
of
rose
,
he
find
a
single
lean
cormorant
,
stand
mateless
and
shelterless
on
poverty
's
bleak
cliff
?
<EOS>
oh
,
confound
him
!
<EOS>
let
him
come
,
and
let
him
laugh
at
the
contrast
between
rumour
and
fact
.
<EOS>
be
he
the
devil
himself
,
instead
of
be
merely
very
like
him
,
I
would
not
condescend
to
get
out
of
his
way
,
or
to
forge
a
smile
or
a
cheerful
word
wherewith
to
avert
his
sarcasm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
then
I
recur
to
the
other
letter
:
<EOS>
that
strike
a
chord
whose
sound
I
could
not
deaden
by
thrust
my
finger
into
my
ear
,
for
it
vibrate
within
;
and
though
its
swell
may
be
exquisite
music
,
its
cadence
be
a
groan
.
  
<EOS>
that
Frances
be
relieve
from
the
pressure
of
want
,
that
the
curse
of
excessive
labour
be
take
off
her
,
fill
me
with
happiness
;
that
her
first
thought
in
prosperity
should

out
the

our

would
,
as

suffice
well

since

where
frugality
in

the

I

<EOS>
the
circumstance
be
briefly
these
:
  
<EOS>
some
three
month
ago
M.
Pelet
have
,
on
the
occasion
of
his
fete
,
give
the
boy
a
treat
,
which
treat
consist
in
a
party
of
pleasure
to
a
certain
place
of
public
resort
in
the
outskirt
of
Brussels
,
of
which
I
do
not
at
this
moment
remember
the
name
,
but
near
it
be
several
of
those
lakelet
call
etang
;
and
there
be
one
etang
,
large
than
the
rest
,
where
on
holiday
people
be
accustom
to
amuse
themselves
by
row
round
it
in
little
boat
.
<EOS>
the
boy
have
eat
an
unlimited
quantity
of
"
gaufre
,
"
and
drank
several
bottle
of
Louvain
beer
,
amid
the
shade
of
a
garden
make
and
provide
for
such
cram
,
petition
the
director
for
leave
to
take
a
row
on
the
etang
.
<EOS>
half
a
dozen
of
the
eld
succeed
in
obtain
leave
,
and
I
be
commission
to
accompany
them
as
surveillant
.
<EOS>
among
the
half
dozen
happen
to
be
a
certain
Jean
Baptiste
Vandenhuten
,
a
most
ponderous
young
Flamand
,
not
tall
,
but
even
now
,
at
the
early
age
of
sixteen
,
possess
a
breadth
and
depth
of
personal
development
truly
national
.
<EOS>
It
chance
that
Jean
be
the
first
lad
to
step
into
the
boat
;
he
stumble
,
roll
to
one
side
,
the
boat
revolt
at
his
weight
and
capsize
.
<EOS>
Vandenhuten
sink
like
lead
,
rise
,
sink
again
.
<EOS>
My
coat
and
waistcoat
be
off
in
an
instant
;
I
have
not
be
bring
up
at
Eton
and
boat
and
bathe
and
swam
there
ten
long
year
for
nothing
;
it
be
a
natural
and
easy
act
for
me
to
leap
to
the
rescue
.
<EOS>
the
lad
and
the
boatman
yell
;
they
think
there
would
be
two
death
by
drown
instead
of
one
;
but
as
Jean
rise
the
third
time
,
I
clutch
him
by
one
leg
and
the
collar
,
and
in
three
minute
more
both
he
and
I
be
safe
land
.
<EOS>
to
speak
heaven
's
truth
,
my
merit
in
the
action
be
small
indeed
,
for
I
have
run
no
risk
,
and
subsequently
do
not
even
catch
cold
from
the
wetting
;
but
when
M.
and
Madame
Vandenhuten
,
of
whom
Jean
Baptiste
be
the
sole
hope
,
come
to
hear
of
the
exploit
,
they
seem
to
think
I
have
evince
a
bravery
and
devotion
which
no
thank
could
sufficiently
repay
.
<EOS>
Madame
,
in
particular
,
be
"
certain
I
must
have
dearly
love
their
sweet
son
,
or
I
would
not
thus
have
hazard
my
own
life
to
save
his
.

"
<EOS>
Monsieur
,
an
honest

look
,
though
phlegmatic
man
,
say
very
little
,
but
he
would
not
suffer
me
to
leave
the
room
,
till
I
have
promise
that
in
case
I
ever
stand
in
need
of
help
I
would
,
by
apply
to
him
,
give
him
a
chance
of
discharge
the
obligation
under
which
he
affirm
I
have
lay
him

<EOS>
these
word
,
then
,
be
my
glimmer
of
light

it
be
here
<EOS>
I
find
my
sole
outlet
;
and
in
truth
,
though
the
cold
light
rouse
,
it
do
not
cheer
me
;
nor
do
the
outlet
seem
such
as
I
should
like
to
pass
through
.
<EOS>
right
I
have
none
to
M.
Vandenhuten
's
good
office
;
it
be
not
on
the
ground
of
merit
I
could
apply
to
him
;
<EOS>
no
,
I
must
stand
on
that
of
necessity
<EOS>
:
I
have
no
work
;
I
want
work
;
my
good
chance
of
obtain
it
lie
in
secure
his
recommendation
.
<EOS>
this
I
know
could
be
have
by
ask
for
it
;
not
to
ask
,
because
the
request
revolt
my
pride
and
contradict
my
habit
,
would
,
I
feel
,
be
an
indulgence
of
false
and
indolent
fastidiousness
.
<EOS>
I
may
repent
the
omission
all
my
life
;
I
would
not
then
be
guilty
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
that
evening
I
go

I

Ostend
 
do
not

"
You

I
cry

throw
open

for

indeed

I
have
seldom
feel
so
feverish

<EOS>
hear
a
step
ascend
the

I
wonder
whether
the

now
mount
to
his

be
as
unsettle
in

<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
be

come

to
solve
the

hardly

in
inaudible
thought

<EOS>
He
have
actually
knock
at
the
door
 
at
my
door
;
a
smart
,
prompt
rap
;
and
,
almost
before
I
could
invite
him
in

he
be
over
the
threshold

have
close
the
door
behind
him

<EOS>
"
and
how
be
you
?
"
ask
an
indifferent
,
quiet
voice
,
in
the
english
language
;
while
my
visitor
,
without
any
sort
of
bustle
or
introduction
,
put
his
hat
on
the
table
,
and
his
glove
into
his
hat

draw
the

armchair
the

a

forward

seat
himself
tranquilly
therein

<EOS>
"
can
not

<EOS>
"
he
inquire
in
a
few
moment
,
in
a
tone
whose
nonchalance
seem
to
intimate
that
it
be
much
the
same
thing
whether
I
answer
or
not

<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
I
find
it
desirable
to
have
recourse
to
my
good
friend
"
les

"
not
exactly
to
ascertain
the
identity
of
my
visitor
 
for
I
already
know
him

confound
his
impudence

<EOS>
but
to
see
how
he
look
 
to
get
a
clear
notion
of
his
mien
and
countenance
.
<EOS>
I
wipe
the
glass
very
deliberately
,
and
put
them
on
quite
as
deliberately
;
adjust
them
so
as
not
to
hurt
the
bridge
of
my
nose
or
get
entangle
in
my
short
tuft
of
dun
hair

the
window
-
seat
,
with
my
back
to
the
light
,
and
I
have
him
VIS
-
A
-
VIS
;
a
position
he
would
much
rather
have
have
reverse
;
for
,
at
any
time
,
he
prefer
scrutinize
to
be
scrutinize
.
<EOS>
yes
,
it
be
he
,
and
no
mistake
,
with
his
six
foot
of
length
arrange
in
a
sit
attitude
;
with
his
dark
travelling
surtout
with
its
velvet
collar
,
his
gray
pantaloon
,
his
black
stock
,
and
his
face
,
the
most
original
one
Nature
ever
model
,
yet
the
least
obtrusively
so
;
not
one
feature
that
could
be
term
marked
or
odd
,
yet
the
effect
of
the
whole
unique
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
use
in
attempt
to
describe
what
be
indescribable
.
<EOS>
be
in
no
hurry
to
address
him
,
I
sit
and
stare
at
my
ease
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
that
be
your
game
 
<EOS>
be
it
?
"
say
he
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
we
will
see
which
be
soon
tired
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
slowly
draw
out
a
fine
cigar
-
case
,
pick
one
to
his
taste
,
light
it
,
take
a
book
from
the
shelf
convenient
to
his
hand
,
then
lean
back
,
proceed
to
smoke
and
read
as
tranquilly
as
if
he
have
be
in
his
own
room
,
in
Grove
-
street
,
X
 
shire
,
England
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
be
capable
of
continue
in
that
attitude
till
midnight
,
if
he
conceive
the
whim
,
so
I
rise
,
and
take
the
book
from
his
hand
,
I
say
,
    
"
You
do
not
ask
for
it
,
and
you
shall
not
have
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
silly
and
dull
,
"
he
observe
,
"
<EOS>
so
I
have
not
lose
much
;
"
then
the
spell
be
break
,
he
go
on
:
"
<EOS>
I
think
you
live
at
Pelet
's
;
I
go
there
this
afternoon
expect
to
be
starve
to
death
by
sit
in
a
boarding
-
school
drawing
-
room
,
and
they
tell
me
you
be
go
,
have
depart
this
morning
;
you
have
leave
your
address
behind
you
though
,
which
I
wonder
at
;
it
be
a
more
practical
and
sensible
precaution
than
I
should
have
imagine
you
capable
of
.
<EOS>
why
do
you
leave
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
because
M.
Pelet
have
just
marry
the
lady
whom
you
and
Mr.
Brown
assign
to
me
as
my
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
indeed
!
"
reply
Hunsden
with
a
short
laugh
;
"
so
you
have
lose
both
your
wife
and
your
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
precisely
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
see
him
give
a
quick
,
covert
glance
<EOS>
all
round
my
room
;
he
mark
its
narrow
limit
,
its
scanty
furniture
:
in
an
instant
he
have
comprehend
the
state
of
matter
 
have
absolve
me
from
the
crime
of
prosperity
.
<EOS>
a
curious
effect
this
discovery
work
in
his
strange
mind
;
I
be
morally
certain
that
if
he
have
find
me
instal
in
a
handsome
parlour
,
lounge
on
a
soft
couch
,
with
a
pretty
,
wealthy
wife
at
my
side
,
he
would
have
hate
me
;
a
brief
,
cold
,
haughty
visit
,
would
in
such
a
case
have
be
the
extreme
limit
of
his
civility
,
and
never
would
he
have
come
near
me
more
,
so
long
as
the
tide
of
fortune
bear
me
smoothly
on
its
surface
;
but
the
paint
furniture
,
the
bare
wall
,
the
cheerless
solitude
of
my
room
relax
his
rigid
pride
,
and
I
know
not
what
soften
change
have
take
place
both
in
his
voice
and
look
ere
<EOS>
he
speak
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
You

another

<EOS>

no

no

You

He
serve

I
make
no

I
let
him
think
so
,
not
feel
inclined
to
enter
into
an
explanation
of
the
real
state
of
thing
,
and
as
little
to
forge
a
false
account

it
be
not
easy
to
blind
Hunsden

my
very
silence
,
instead
of
convince
him
that
he
have
hit
the
truth

seem
to
render
him
doubtful
about
it

he
go
on
:
    
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
the

conduct

such

always
be
amongst

you
offer
her
your
youth
and
your
talent
 
such
as
they
be
 
in
exchange
for
her
position
and
money
:
I
do
not
suppose
you
take
appearance
,
or
what
be
call
LOVE
,
into
the
account
 
<EOS>
for
I
understand
she
be
old
than
you

Brown
say
,
rather
sensible

look
than
beautiful

<EOS>
She

have
then
no
chance

make
a
well

first
incline

Pelet

very
glad

glad

have
baffle
the
sagacity

baffle
it

I
could
never

play
of
their

no

<EOS>
cutting
as
these
word
may
have
be
under
some
circumstance

they
draw
no
blood
now

<EOS>
My
life
be
change
;
my
experience
have
be
vary
since
I
leave
X
 
,
but
Hunsden
could
not
know
this
;
he
have
see
me
only
in
the
character
of
Mr.
Crimsworth
's
clerk
 
a
dependant
amongst
wealthy
stranger
,
meeting
disdain
with
a
hard
front
,
conscious
of
an
unsocial
and
unattractive
exterior
,
refuse
to
sue
for
notice
which
I
be
sure
would
be
withhold
,
decline
to
evince
an
admiration
which
I
know
would
be
scorn
as
worthless
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
aware
that
since
then
youth
and
loveliness
have
be
to
me
everyday
object
;
that
I
have
study
them
at
leisure
and
closely
,
and
have
see
the
plain
texture
of
truth
under
the
embroidery
of
appearance
;
nor
could
he
,
keen
-
sight
as
he
be
,
penetrate
into
my
heart
,
search
my
brain
,
and
read
my
peculiar
sympathy
and
antipathy
;
he
have
not
know
me
long
enough
,
or
well
enough
,
to
perceive
how
low
my
feeling
would
ebb
under
some
influence
,
powerful
over
most
mind
;
how
high
,
how
fast
they
would
flow
under
other
influence
,
that
perhaps
act
with
the
more
intense
force
on
me
,
because
they
act
on
me
alone
.
<EOS>
neither
could
he
suspect
for
an
instant
the
history
of
my
communication
with
Mdlle

<EOS>
reuter
;
secret
to
him
and
to
all
other
be
the
tale
of
her
strange
infatuation
;
her
blandishment
,
her
wile
have
be
see
but
by
me
,
and
to
me
only
be
they
know
;
but
they
have
change
me
,
for
they
have
prove
that
I
COULD
impress
.
<EOS>
a
sweet
secret
nestled
deeper
in
my
heart
;
one
full
of
tenderness
and
as
full
of
strength
:
it
take
the
ste
out
of
Hunsden
's
sarcasm
;
it
keep
me
unbent
by
shame
,
and
unstirre
by
wrath
.
<EOS>
but
of
all
this
I
could
say
nothing
 
nothing
decisive
at
least
;
uncertainty
seal
my
lip
,
and
<EOS>
during
the
interval
of
silence
by
which
alone
I
reply
to
Mr.
Hunsden
,
I
make
up
my
mind
to
be
for
the
present
wholly
misjudge
by
him
,
and
misjudge
I
be
;
he
think
he
have
be
rather
too
hard
upon
me
,
and
that
I
be
crush
by
the
weight
of
his
upbraiding
;
so
to
re
-
assure
me
<EOS>
he
say
,
doubtless
I
should
mend
some
day
;
I
be
only
at
the
beginning
of
life
yet
;
and
since
happily
I
be
not
quite
without
sense
,
every
false
step
I
make
would
be
a
good
lesson
.
  
<EOS>
just
then
I
turn
my
face
a
little
to
the
light
;
the
approach
of
twilight
,
and
my
position
in
the
window
-
seat
,
have
,
for
the
last
ten
minute
,
prevent
him
from
study
my
countenance
;
as
I
move
,
however
,
he
catch
an
expression
which
he
thus
interpret
<EOS>
:
    
"
confound
it
!
<EOS>
how
doggedly
self
-
approve
the
lad
look
!
<EOS>
I
think
he
be
fit
to
die
with
shame
,
and
there
he
sit
grin
smile
,
as
good
as
to
say
,
"
let
the
world
wag
as
it
will
,
I
have
the
philosopher
's
stone
in
my
waist

coat
pocket
,
and
the
elixir
of
life
in
my
cupboard

I
be
independent
of
both
Fate
and
Fortune

you

It

<EOS>
he
laugh
,
as
mockingly
,
as
heartlessly
as
Mephistopheles

and
so
laugh
,
vanish
.
  
<EOS>
some
people
,
however
indifferent
they
may
become
after
a
considerable
space
of
absence
,
always
contrive
to
leave
a
pleasant
impression
just
at
parting
;
<EOS>
not
so
Hunsden
,
a
conference
with
him
affect
one
like
a
draught
of
peruvian
bark
;
it
seem
a
concentration
of
the
specially
harsh
,
stringent
,
bitter
;
whether
,
like
bark
,
it
invigorate
,
I
scarcely
know
.
  
<EOS>
a
ruffled
mind
make
a
restless
pillow
;
I
sleep
little
on
the
night
after
this
interview
;
towards
morning
I
begin
to
doze
,
but
hardly
have
my
slumber
become
sleep
,
when
I
be
rouse
from
it
by
hear
a
noise
in
my
sitting
room
,
to
which
my
bed
-
room
adjoin
 
a
step
,
and
a
shoving
of
furniture
;
the
movement
last
barely
two
minute
;
with
the
closing
of
the
door
it
cease
.
<EOS>
I
listen
;
not
a
mouse
stir
;
perhaps
I
have
dreamt
it
;
perhaps
a
locataire
have
make
a
mistake
,
and
enter
my
apartment
instead
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
It
be
yet
but
five
o'clock
;
neither
I
nor
the
day
be
wide
awake
;
I
turn
,
and
be
soon
unconscious
.
<EOS>
when
I
do
rise
,
about
two
hour
later
,
I
have
forget
the
circumstance
;
the
first
thing
I
see
,
however
,
on
quit
my
chamber
,
recall
it
;
just
push
in
at
the
door
of
my
sitting
-
room
,
and
still
stand
on
end
,
be
a
wooden
packing
-
case
 
a
rough
deal
affair
,
wide
but
shallow
;
a
porter
have
doubtless
shove
it
forward
,
but
see
no
occupant
of
the
room
,
have
leave
it
at
the
entrance
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
none
of
mine

"
think
I
,
approach
;
"
it
must
be
mean
for
somebody
else

"
I
stoop
to
examine
the
address
:

"
  
<EOS>
I
be
puzzle
,
but
conclude
that
the
good
way
to
obtain
information
be
to
ask
within
,
I
cut
the
cord
and
open
the
case
.
<EOS>
green
baize
envelop
its
content
,
sew
carefully
at
the
side
;
I
rip
the
pack

thread
with
my
pen
-
knife
,
and
still
,
as
the
seam
give
way
,
glimpse
of
gilding
appear
through
the
widen
interstice
.
<EOS>
board
and
baize
being
at
length
remove
,
I
lift
from
the
case
a
large
picture
,
in
a
magnificent
frame
;
lean
it
against
a
chair
,
in
a
position
where
the
light
from
the
window
fall
favourably
upon
it
,
I
step
back
 
already
I
have
mount
my
spectacle
.
<EOS>
a
portrait
-
painter
's
sky
(
the
most
sombre
and
threatening
of
welkins
)
,
and
distant
tree
of
a
conventional
depth
of
hue
,
raise
in
full
relief
a
pale
,
pensive
-
look
female
face
,
shadow
with
soft
dark
hair
,
almost
blend
with
the
equally
dark
cloud
;
large
,
solemn
eye
look
reflectively
into
mine
;
a
thin
cheek
rest
on
a
delicate
little
hand
;
a
shawl
,
artistically
drape
,
half
hid
,
half
show
a
slight
figure
.
<EOS>
a
listener
(
have
there
be
one
)
may
have
hear
me
,
after
ten
minute
'
silent
gazing
,
utter
the
word
"
Mother
!
<EOS>
"
I
may
have
say
more
 
<EOS>
but
with
me
,
the
first
word
utter
aloud
in
soliloquy
rouse
consciousness
;
it
remind
me
that
only
crazy
people
talk
to
themselves
,
and
then
I
think
out
my
monologue
,
instead
of
speak
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
think
a
long
while
,
and
a
long
while
have
contemplate
the
intelligence
,
the
sweetness
,
and
 
alas
!
<EOS>
the
sadness
also
of
those
fine
,
grey
eye
,
the
mental
power
of
that
forehead
,
and
the
rare
sensibility
of
that
serious
mouth
,
when
my
glance
,
travel
downward
,
fall
on
a
narrow
billet
,
stick
in
the
corner
of
the
picture
,
between
the
frame
and
the
canvas
.
<EOS>
then
I
first
ask
,
"
who
send
this
picture
?
<EOS>
who
think
of
me
,
save
it
out
of
the
wreck
of
Crimsworth
Hall
,
and
now
commit
it
to
the
care
of
its
natural
keeper
?
<EOS>
"
I
take
the
note
from
its
niche
;
thus
it
speak
:
    
"
there
be
a
sort
of
stupid
pleasure
in
give
a
child
sweet
,
a
fool
his
bell
,
a
dog
a
bone
.
<EOS>
You
be
repay
by
see
the
child
besmear
his
face
with
sugar
;
by
witness
how
the
fool
's
ecstasy
make
a
great
fool
of
him
than
ever
;
by
watch
the
dog
's
nature
come
out
over
his
bone
.
<EOS>
in
give
William
Crimsworth
his
mother
's
picture
,
I
give
him
sweet
,
bell
,
and
bone
all
in
one
;
what
grieve
me
be
,
that
I
can
not
behold
the
result
;
I
would
have
add
five
shilling
more
to
my
bid
if
the
auctioneer
could
only
have
promise
me
that
pleasure
.

P.S.
 
<EOS>
You
say
last
night
you
positively
decline
add
another
item
to
your
account
with
me
;
do
not
you
think
I
have
save
you
that
trouble
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
muffle
the
picture
in
its
green
baize
covering
,
restore
it
to
the
case
,
and
have
transport
the
whole
concern
to
my
bed
-
room
,
put
it
out
of
sight
under
my
bed
.
<EOS>
My
pleasure
be
now
poison
by
pungent
pain
;
I
determine
to
look
no
more
till
I
could
look
at
my
ease
.
<EOS>
if
Hunsden
have
come
in
at
that
moment
,
I
should
have
say
to
him
,
"
I
owe
you
nothing
,
Hunsden
 
not
a
fraction
of
a
farthing
:
you
have
pay
yourself
in
taunt
!
"
  
<EOS>
too
anxious
to
remain
any
longer
quiescent
,
I
have
no
sooner
breakfast
,
than
I
repair
once
more
to
M.
Vandenhuten
's
,
scarcely
hope
to
find
him
at
home
;
for
a
week
have
barely
elapse
since
my
first
call
:
but
fancy
I
may
be
able
to
glean
information
as
to
the
time
when
his
return
be
expect
.
<EOS>
a
well
result
await
me
than
I
have
anticipate
,
for
though
the
family
be
yet
at
Ostend
,
M.
Vandenhuten
have
come
over
to
Brussels
on
business
for
the
day
.
<EOS>
He
receive
me
with
the
quiet
kindness
of
a
sincere
though
not
excitable
man
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
sit
five
minute
alone
with
him
in
his
bureau
,
before
I
become
aware
of
a
sense
of
ease
in
his
presence
,
such
as
I
rarely
experience
with
stranger
.
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
at
my
own
composure
,
for
,
after
all
,
I
have
come
on
business
to
me
exceedingly
painful
 
<EOS>
that
of
solicit
a
favour
.
<EOS>
I
ask
on
what
basis
the
calm
rest
 
<EOS>
I
fear
it
may
be
deceptive
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
I
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
ground
,
and
at
once
I
feel
assured
of
its
solidity
;
I
know
where
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
M.
Vandenhuten
be
rich
,
respected
,
and
influential
;
<EOS>
I
,
poor
,
despised
and
powerless
<EOS>
;
so
we
stand
to
the
world
at
large
as
member
of
the
world
's
society
;
but
to
each
other
,
as
a
pair
of
human
being
,
our
position
be
reverse
.
<EOS>
the
Dutchman
(
he
be
not
Flamand
,
but
pure
Hollandais
)
be
slow
,
cool
,
of
rather
dense
intelligence
,
though
sound
and
accurate
judgment
;
the
Englishman
far
more
nervous
,
active
,
quicker
both
to
plan
and
to
practise
,
to
conceive
and
to
realize
.
<EOS>
the
dutchman
be
benevolent
,
the
Englishman
susceptible
;
in
short
our
character
dovetail
,
but
my
mind
have
more
fire
and
action
than
his
,
instinctively
assume
and
keep
the
predominance
.
  
<EOS>
this
point
settle
,
and
my
position
well
ascertained
,
I
address
him
on
the
subject
of
my
affair
with
that
genuine
frankness
which
full
confidence
can
alone
inspire
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
pleasure
to
him
to
be
so
appeal
to
;
he
thank
me
for
give
him
this
opportunity
of
use
a
little
exertion
in
my
behalf
.
<EOS>
I
go
on
to
explain
to
him
that
my
wish
be
not
so
much
to
be
help
,
as
to
be
put
into
the
way
of
help
myself
;
of
him
I
do
not
want
exertion
 
<EOS>
that
be
to
be
my
part
 
but
only
information
and
recommendation
.
<EOS>
soon
after
I
rise
to
go
.
<EOS>
He
hold
out
his
hand
at
part
 
an
action
of
great
significance
with
foreigner
than
with
Englishmen

<EOS>
as
I
exchange
a

I

the

his

like
solace
in
the

animate
the
honest
breast
of
Victor
Vandenhuten
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
fortnight
be
a
period
of
many
alternation
;
my
existence
during
its
lapse
resemble
a
sky
of
one
of
those
autumnal
night
which
be
specially
haunt
by
meteor
and
fall
star
.
<EOS>
hope
and
fear
,
expectation
and
disappointment
,
descend
in

shower
from
zenith
to
horizon

but
all
be
transient
,
and
darkness
follow
swift
each
vanish
apparition
.
<EOS>
M.
Vandenhuten
aid
me
faithfully
;
he
set
me
on
the
track
of
several
place
,
and
himself
make
effort
to
secure
them
for
me
;
but
for
a
long
time
solicitation
and
recommendation
be
vain
 
<EOS>
the
door
either
shut
in
my
face
when
I
be
about
to
walk
in
,
or
another
candidate
,
enter
before
me
,
render
my
further
advance
useless
.
<EOS>
feverish
and
rouse
,
no
disappointment
arrest
me
;
defeat
follow
fast
on
defeat
serve
as
stimulant
to
will
.
<EOS>
I
forgot
fastidiousness
,
conquer
reserve
,
thrust
pride
from
me
:
<EOS>
I
ask
,
<EOS>
I
persevere
,
I
remonstrate
,
I
dun
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
that
opening
be
force
into
the
guard
circle
where
Fortune
sit
deal
favour
round
.
<EOS>
My
perseverance
make
me
known
;
my
importunity
make
me
remark
.
<EOS>
I
be
inquire
about
;
my
former
pupil
'
parent
,
gather
the
report
of
their
child
,
hear
me
speak
of
as
talented
,
and
they
echo
the
word
:
the
sound
,
bandy
about
at
random
,
come
at
last
to
ear
which
,
but
for
its
universality
,
it
may
never
have
reach
;
and
at
the
very
crisis
when
I
have
try
my
last
effort
and
know
not
what
to
do
,
Fortune
look
in
at
me
one
morning
,
as
I
sit
in
drear
and
almost
desperate
deliberation
on
my
bedstead
,
nod
with
the
familiarity
of
an
old
acquaintance
 
though
God
know
I
have
never
meet
her
before
 
and
throw
a
prize
into
my
lap
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
second
week
of
October
,
18
 
,
I
get
the
appointment
of
english
professor
to
all
the
class
of
 
College
,
Brussels
,
with
a
salary
of
three
thousand
franc
per
annum
;
and
the
certainty
of
be
able
,
by
dint
of
the
reputation
and
publicity
accompany
the
position
,
to
make
as
much
more
by
private
mean
.
<EOS>
the
official
notice
,
which
communicate
this
information
,
mention
also
that
it
be
the
strong
recommendation
of
M.
Vandenhuten
,
negociant
,
which
have
turn
the
scale
of
choice
in
my
favour
.
  
<EOS>
no
sooner
have
I
read
the
announcement
than
I
hurry
to
M.
Vandenhuten
's
bureau
,
push
the
document
under
his
nose
,
and
when
he
have
peruse
it
,
take
both
his
hand
,
and
thank
him
with
unrestrained
vivacity
.
<EOS>
My
vivid
word
and
emphatic
gesture
move
his
dutch
calm
to
unwonted
sensation
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
be
happy
 
<EOS>
glad
to
have
serve
me
;
but
he
have
do
nothing
merit
such
thank
.
<EOS>
He
have
not
lay
out
a
centime
 
<EOS>
only
scratch
a
few
word
on
a
sheet
of
paper
.
  
<EOS>
again
I
repeat
to
him
    
<EOS>
"
You
have
make
me
quite
happy
,
and
in
a
way
that
suit
me
;
I
do
not
feel
an
obligation
irksome

confer
by
your
kind

;
I
do
not
feel
disposed
to
shun
you
because
you
have
do
me
a
favour

from
this
day
you
must
consent
to
admit
me
to
your
intimate

for
I
shall
hereafter
recur
again
and
again
to
the
pleasure
of
your

<EOS>
"
Ainsi
soit

"
be
the
reply
,
accompany
by
a
smile
of
benignant
content
.
<EOS>
I
go
away
with
its
sunshine
in
my
heart
.
    
<EOS>
it
be
two
o'clock
when
I
return
to
my
lodging
;
my
dinner
,
just
bring
in
from
a
neighbour
hotel
,
smoke
on
the
table
;
I
sit
down
think
to
eat
 
<EOS>
have
the
plate
be
heap
with
potsherd
and
broken
glass
,
instead
of
boil
beef
and
haricot
,
I
could
not
have
make
a
more
signal
failure
:
appetite
have
forsake
me
.
<EOS>
impatient
of
see
food
which
I
could
not
taste
,
I
put
it
all
aside
into
a
cupboard
,
and
then
demand
,
"
what
shall
I
do
till
evening
?
"
<EOS>
for
before
six
P.M.
it
would
be
vain
to
seek
the
Rue
Notre
Dame
aux
Neiges
;
its
inhabitant
(
for
me
it
have
but
one
)
be
detain
by
her
vocation
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
I
walk
in
the
street
of
Brussels
,
and
I
walk
in
my
own
room
from
two
o'clock
till
six
;
never
once
in
that
space
of
time
do
I
sit
down
.
<EOS>
I
be
in
my
chamber
when
the
last
-
name
hour
strike
;
I
have
just
bathe
my
face
and
feverish
hand
,
and
be
stand
near
the
glass
;
my
cheek
be
crimson
,
my
eye
be
flame
,
still
all
my
feature
look
quite
settle
and
calm
.
<EOS>
descend
swiftly
the
stair
and
step
out
,
I
be
glad
to
see
Twilight
draw
on
in
cloud
;
such
shade
be
to
me
like
a
grateful
screen
,
and
the
chill
of
latter
Autumn
,
breathe
in
a
fitful
wind
from
the
north
-
west
,
meet
me
as
a
refresh
coolness
.
<EOS>
still
I
see
it
be
cold
to
other
,
for
the
woman
I
pass
be
wrap
in
shawl
,
and
the
man
have
their
coat
button
close
.
  
<EOS>
when
be
we
quite
happy
?
<EOS>
be
I
<EOS>
so
then
?
<EOS>
no
;
an
urgent
and
grow
dread
worry
my
nerve
,
and
have
worry
them
since
the
first
moment
good
tiding
have
reach
me
.
<EOS>
how
be
france
?
<EOS>
It
be
ten
week
since
I
have
see
her
,
six
since
I
have
hear
from
her
,
or
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
answer
her
letter
by
a
brief
note
,
friendly
but
calm
,
in
which
no
mention
of
continued
correspondence
or
further
visit
be
make
.
<EOS>
at
that
hour
my
bark
hang
on
the
topmost
curl
of
a
wave
of
fate
,
and
I
know
not
on
what
shoal
<EOS>
the
onward
rush
of
the
billow
may
hurl
it
;
I
would
not
then
attach
her
destiny
to
mine
by
the
slight
thread
;
if
doom
to
split
on
the
rock
,
or
run
aground
on
the
sand

bank
,
I
be
resolve
no
other
vessel
should
share
my
disaster
:
but
six
week
be
a
long
time
;
and
could
it
be
that
she
be
still
well
and
do
well
?
<EOS>
be
not
all
sage
agree
in
declare
that
happiness
find
no
climax
on
earth
?
<EOS>
dare
<EOS>
I
think
that
but
half
a
street
now
divide
me
from
the
full
cup
of
contentment
 
<EOS>
the
draught
draw
from
water
say
to
flow
only
in

<EOS>
I
be
at
the
door
;
I
enter
the
quiet
house
;
I
mount
the
stair
;
the
lobby
be
void
and
still
<EOS>

all
the

I
look

it

duly
in

<EOS>
"

I
say
,
and
advanced

<EOS>

but
I
will
be
a
little
calm
;
I
be
not
go
to
rush
in

and
get
up
a
scene
directly

"
<EOS>
forcibly
stay
my
eager

I
pause
on
the

<EOS>
"
what

I
demand
to
myself

a

<EOS>
a

backwards

Would

Ere

His

Sir

would

<EOS>
look
at
the
rigid
and
formal
race
of
old
maid
 
the
race
whom
all
despise
;
they
have
feed
themselves
,
from
youth
upwards
,
on
maxim
of
resignation
and
endurance
.
<EOS>
many
of

get
ossify

so
continually
their

,
so
perpetually
their

,
that
at
last
it
absorb
the
soft
and
more
agreeable
quality
of
their
nature
;
and
they
die
mere
model
of
austerity
,
fashion
out
of
a

much

<EOS>
anatomist
will
tell
you
that
there
be
a

in
the
withered
old

carcass
 
the

in
that

<EOS>
Can
this
be
so
?
<EOS>
I
really
do
not
know
;
but
feel
inclined
to
doubt
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
come
forward
,
bade
france
"
good
evening
,
"
and
take
my
seat
.
<EOS>
the
chair
I
have
choose
be
one
she
have
probably
just
leave
;
it
stand
by
a
little
table
where
be
her
open
desk
and
paper
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
she
have
fully
recognize
me
at
first
,
but
she
do
so
now
;
and
in
a
voice
,
soft
but
quiet
,
she
return
my
greeting
.
<EOS>
I
have
show
no
eagerness
;
she
take
her
cue
from
me
,
and
evince
no
surprise
.
<EOS>
We
meet
as
we
have
always
meet
,
as
master
and
pupil
 
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
I
proceed
to
handle
the
paper
;
france
,
observant
and
serviceable
,
step
into
an
inner
room
,
bring
a
candle
,
light
it
,
place
it
by
me
;
then
draw
the
curtain
over
the
lattice
,
and
have
add
a
little
fresh
fuel
to
the
already
bright
fire
,
she
draw
a
second
chair
to
the
table
and
sit
down
at
my
right
hand
,
a
little
removed
.
<EOS>
the
paper
on
the
top
be
a
translation
of
some
grave
french
author
into
English
,
but
underneath
lie
a
sheet
with
stanza
;
on
this
I
lay
hand
.
<EOS>
france
half
rise
,
make
a
movement
to
recover
the
capture
spoil
,
say
,
that
be
nothing
 
a
mere
copy
of
verse
.
<EOS>
I
put
by
resistance
with
the
decision
<EOS>
I
know
she
never
long
opposed
;
but
on
this
occasion
her
finger
have
fasten
on
the
paper
.
<EOS>
I
have
quietly
to
unloose
them
;
their
hold
dissolve
to
my
touch
;
her
hand
shrink
away
;
my
own
would
fain
have
follow
it
,
but
for
the
present
I
forbid
such
impulse
.
<EOS>
the
first
page
of
the
sheet
be
occupy
with
the
line
I
have
overhear
;
the
sequel
be
not
exactly
the
writer
's
own
experience
,
but
a
composition
by
portion
of
that
experience
suggest
.
<EOS>
thus
while
egotism
be
avoid
,
the
fancy
be
exercise
,
and
the
heart
satisfy
.
<EOS>
I
translate
as
before

and
my
translation
be
nearly
literal

it
continue
thus
:
    
when
sickness
stay'd
<EOS>
awhile
my
course

He
seem'd
impatient
still
,
because
his
pupil
's
flagging
force
Could
not
obey
his
will
.
  
<EOS>
one
day
when
summon
to
the
bed
where
pain
and
I
do
strive
,
I
hear
him
,
as
he
bend
his
head
,
say
,
"
God
,
she
must
revive
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
feel
his
hand
,
with
gentle
stress
,
a
moment
lay
on
mine
,
and
wish
to
mark
my
consciousness
by
some
responsive
sign
.
  
<EOS>
but
pow'rless
then
to
speak
or
move
,
I
only
feel
,
within
,
the
sense
of
Hope
,
the
strength
of
Love
,
Their
healing
work
begin
.
  
<EOS>
and
as
he
from
the
room
withdraw
,
My
heart
his
step
pursue
;
I
long'd
to
prove
,
by
effort
new
;
<EOS>
My
speechless
gratitude
.
  
<EOS>
when
once
again
I
take
my
place
,
long
vacant
,
in
the
class
,
th
'
unfrequent
smile
across
his
face
<EOS>
do
for
one
moment
pass
.
  
<EOS>
the
lesson
do
;
the
signal
make
of
glad
release
and
play
,
He
,
as
he
pass
,
an
instant
stay'd
,
one
kindly
word
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jane
,
till
to
-
morrow
you
be
free
from
tedious
task
and
rule
;
this
afternoon
I
must
not
see
that
yet
pale
face
in
school
.
  
<EOS>
"
seek
in
the
garden
-
shade
a
seat
,
far
from
the
play
-
ground
din
;
<EOS>
the
sun
be
warm
,
the
air
be
sweet
:
<EOS>
stay
till
I
call
you
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
a
long
and
pleasant
afternoon
I
pass
in
those
green
bower
;
all
silent
,
tranquil
,
and
alone
with
bird
,
and
bee
,
and
flower
.
  
<EOS>
yet
,
when
my
master
's
voice
I
hear
Call
,
from
the
window
,
"
Jane
!
<EOS>
"
I
enter
,
joyful
,
at
the
word
,
the
busy
house
again
.
  
<EOS>
He
,
in
the
hall
,
pace
up
and
down
;
He
pause
as
I
pass
by
;
His
forehead
stern
relax
its
frown
<EOS>
:
He
raise
his
deep
-
set
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
not
quite
so
pale
,
"
he
murmur
low
.
"
<EOS>
now
Jane
,
go
rest
awhile
.
"
<EOS>
and
as
I
smile
,
his
smoothen
brow
Returned
as
glad
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
My
perfect
health
restore
,
he
take
His
mien
austere
again
;
and
,
as
before
,
he
would
not
brook
the
slight
fault
from
Jane
.
  
<EOS>
the
long
task
,
the
hard
theme
fall
to
my
share
as
erst
,
and
still
I
toil
to
place
my
name
<EOS>
in
every
study
first
.
  
<EOS>
He
yet
begrudge
and
stinted
praise
,
but
I
have
learn
to
read
the
secret
meaning
of
his
face
,
and
that
be
my
good
meed
.
  
<EOS>
even
when
his
hasty
temper
speak
in
tone
that
sorrow
stir
,
My
grief
be
lull
as
soon
as
wake
by
some
relent
word
.
  
<EOS>
and
when
he
lend
some
precious
book
,
or
give
some
fragrant
flower
,
I
do
not
quail
to
Envy
's
look
,
<EOS>
Upheld
by
Pleasure
's
power
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
our
school
rank
take
their
ground
,
the
hard
-
fought
field
I
win
;
the
prize
,
a
laurel
-
wreath
,
be
bind
My
throbbing
forehead
on
.
  
<EOS>
low
at
my
master
's
knee
<EOS>
I
bend
,
<EOS>
the
offer
crown
to
meet
;
<EOS>
Its
green
leave
through
my
temple
send
a
thrill
as
wild
as
sweet
.
  
<EOS>
the
strong
pulse
of
ambition
strike
in
every
vein
I
own
;
at
the
same
instant
,
bleed
break
a
secret
,
inward
wound
.
  
<EOS>
the
hour
of
triumph
be
to
me
<EOS>
the
hour
of
sorrow
sore
;
a
day
hence
I
must
cross
the
sea
,
Ne'er
to
recross
it
more
.
  
<EOS>
an
hour
hence
,
in
my
master
's
room
<EOS>
I
with
him
sit
alone
,
and
tell
him
what
a
dreary
gloom
o'er
joy
have
part
throw
.
  
<EOS>
He
little
say
;
the
time
be
brief
,
the
ship
be
soon
to
sail
,
<EOS>
and
while
I
sob
in
bitter
grief
,
My
master
but
look
pale
.
  
<EOS>
They
call
in
haste
;
he
bid
me
go
,
then
snatch
me
back
again
;
He
hold
me
fast
and
murmur
low
,
"
why
will
they
part
us
,
Jane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
not
happy
in
my
care
?
<EOS>
do
I
not
faithful
prove
?
<EOS>
Will
other
to
my
darling
bear
as
true
,
as
deep
a
love
?
  
<EOS>
"
o
God
,
watch
o'er
<EOS>
my
foster
child
!
<EOS>
o
guard
her
gentle
head
!
<EOS>
when
mind
be
high
and
tempest
wild
Protection
round
her
spread
!
  
<EOS>
"
They
call
again
;
leave
then
my
breast
;
Quit
thy
true
shelter
,
Jane
;
but
when
deceive
,
repulse
,
oppr
,
come
home
to
me
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
read
 
then
dreamily
make
mark
on
the
margin
with
my
pencil
;
think
all
the
while
of
other
thing
;
think
that
"
Jane
"
be
now
at
my
side
;
no
child
,
but
a
girl
of
nineteen
;
and
she
may
be
mine
,
so
my
heart
affirm
;
poverty
's
curse
be
take
off
me
;
Envy
and
Jealousy
be
far
away
,
and
unapprize
of
this
our
quiet
meeting
;
the
frost
of
the
Master
's
manner
may
melt
;
I
feel
the
thaw
come
fast
,
whether
I
would
or
not
;
no
further
need
for
the
eye
to
practise
a
hard
look
,
for
the
brow
to
compress
its
expanse
into
a
stern
fold
:
it
be
now
permit
to
suffer
the
outward
revelation
of
the
inward
glow
 
to
seek
,
demand
,
elicit
an
answering
ardour
.
<EOS>
while
muse
thus
,
I
think
that
the
grass
on
Hermon
never
drank
the
fresh
dew
of
sunset
more
gratefully
than
my
feeling
drink
the
bliss
of
this
hour
.
  
<EOS>
france
rise
,
as
if
restless
;
she
pass
before
me
to
stir
the
fire
,
which
do
not
want
stir
;
she
lift
and
put
down
the
little
ornament
on
the
mantelpiece
;
her
dress
wave
within
a
yard
of
me
;
slight
,
straight
,
and
elegant
,
she
stand
erect
on
the
hearth
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
impulse
we
can
control
;
but
there
be
other
which
control
us
,
because
they
attain
us
with
a
tiger
-
leap
,
and
be
our
master
ere
we
have
see
them
.
<EOS>
perhaps
,
though
,
such
impulse
be
seldom
altogether
bad
;
perhaps
reason
,
by
a
process
as
brief
as
quiet
,
a
process
that
be
finish
ere
feel
,
have
ascertain
the
sanity
of
the
deed
Instinct
meditate
,
and
feel
justified
in
remain
passive
while
it
be
perform
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
do
not
reason
,
I
do
not
plan
or
intend
,
yet
,
whereas
one
moment
I
be
sit
solus
on
the
chair
near
the
table
,
the
next
,
I
hold
Frances
on
my
knee
,
place
there
with
sharpness
and
decision
,
and
retain
with
exceed
tenacity
.
  
<EOS>
"
monsieur
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Frances
,
and
be
still
:
<EOS>
not
another
word
escape
her
lip
;
sorely
confound
she
seem
during
the
lapse
of
the
first
few
moment
;
but
the
amazement
soon
subside
;
terror
do
not
succeed
,
nor
fury
:
after
all
,
she
be
only
a
little
near
than
she
have
ever
be
before
,
to
one
she
habitually
respect
and
trusted
;
embarrassment
may
have
impel
her
to
contend
,
but
self
-
respect
check
resistance
where
resistance
be
useless
.
  
<EOS>
"
Frances
,
how
much
regard
have
you
for
me
?
"
be
my
demand
.
<EOS>
no
answer
;
the
situation
be
yet
too
new
and
surprising
to
permit
speech
.
<EOS>
on
this
consideration
,
I
compel
myself
for
some
second
to
tolerate
her
silence
,
though
impatient
of
it
:
presently
,
I
repeat
the
same
question
 
probably
,
not
in
the
calm
of
tone
;
she
look
at
me
;
my
face
,
doubtless
,
be
no
model
of
composure
,
my
eye
no
still
well
of
tranquillity
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
speak
,
"
I
urge
;
and
a
very
low
,
hurried
,
yet
still
arch
voice
say
    
"
Monsieur

vous
me
faite
mal
;
de

un

ma

"
  
<EOS>
in
truth
I
become
aware
that
I
be
hold
the
say
"

"
in
a
somewhat
ruthless
grasp
<EOS>
:
I
do
as
desire
;
and
,
for
the
third
time
,
ask
more
gently
    
"
Frances
,
how
much
regard
have
you
for
me
?

<EOS>
"
Mon

the
truthful
rejoinder

you
enough
to

yourself
to

<EOS>
to

"
  
<EOS>
I
feel
the
agitation
of
the
heart
,
I
see
"
the
purple
light
of
love
"
cast
its
glowing
reflection
on
cheek
,
temple
,
neck
;
I
desire
to
consult
the
eye

shelter
lash
and

"

<EOS>
a
pause
;
then
with
a
new
,
yet
still
subdue
inflexion
of
the

an
inflexion
which
provoke
while

accompany

too

by
a
"

<EOS>
some
moment
be
take
for
reflection
;
the

pronounce
slowly
,
run
thus
:
    
"
You

I

I

to
see

I
like

I

you
be
very
good
,
and
very
superior
;
I
know
you
be
stern
to
those
who
be
careless
and
idle
,
but
you
be
kind
,
very
kind
to
the
attentive
and
industrious

even
if
they
be
not
clever

<EOS>
Master
,
I
should
be
GLAD

live
with
you
always
;
"
and
she
make
a
sort
of
movement
,
as
if
she
would
have
cling
to
me
,
but
restrain
herself
she
only

with
earnest
emphasis

<EOS>

<EOS>
I
draw
her
a
little
nearer
to
my
heart
;
I
take
a
first
kiss
from
her
lip
,
thereby
seal
the
compact
,
now
frame
between
us
;
afterwards
she
and
I
be
silent
,
nor
be
our
silence
brief

<EOS>
france
'
thought
,
during
this
interval
,
I
know
not
,
nor
do
I
attempt
to
guess
them
;
I
be
not
occupy
in
search
her
countenance
,
nor
in
otherwise
trouble
her
composure
.
<EOS>
the
peace
I
feel
,
I
wish
her
to
feel
;
my
arm

still
detain
her

with
a
restraint
that
be
gentle
enough
,
so
long
as
no
opposition
tighten
it

<EOS>
My
gaze
be
on

red
fire

its

it

the
depth
fathomless

<EOS>
"
Monsieur

"
at

say
my
quiet
companion
,
as
stirless
in
her

as
a

in

terror

<EOS>
even
now
in

she
scarcely
lift
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
france

<EOS>
"
I
like
unexaggerated
intercourse
;
it
be
not
my
way
to
overpower
with
amorous
epithet

any
more
than
to
worry
with

importunate

I
remind

<EOS>
"
well

monsieur

I

merely
to

that

I
mean
good

<EOS>
thus
we
shall
have
both

I

that

not

You

I

salary
of
three
thousand
franc
a
year

which
I
can
easily
double
by
a
little
additional

<EOS>
thus
you
see
it
would
be
useless
for
you
to
fag
yourself
by
go
out
to
give
lesson
;
on
six
thousand
franc
you

I
can
live

and
live
well

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
france
seem
to
consider
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
flattering
to
man

strength

something
consonant
to
his
honourable
pride
,
in
the
idea
of
become
the

what
he
love
 
feeding
and
clothing
it
,
as
God
do
the
lily
of
the
field
.
<EOS>
so
,
to
decide
her
resolution
,
I
go
on
:
    
<EOS>
"
life
have
be
painful
and
laborious
enough
to
you
so
far
,
france
;
you
require
complete
rest
;
your
twelve
hundred
franc
would
not
form
a
very
important
addition
to
our
income
,
and
what
sacrifice
of
comfort
to
earn
it
!
<EOS>
relinquish
your
labours
:
you
must
be
weary
,
and
let
me
have
the
happiness
of
give
you
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
whether
france
have
accord
due
attention
to
my
harangue
;
instead
of
answer
me
with
her
usual
respectful
promptitude
,
she
only
sigh
and
say
,
    
"
how
rich
you
be
,
monsieur
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
she
stir
uneasy
in
my
arm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
three
thousand
franc
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
murmur
,
"
while
I
get
only
twelve
hundred
!
"
<EOS>
She
go
on
faster
.
"
<EOS>
however
,
it
must
be
so
for
the
present
;
and
,
monsieur
,
be
you
not
say
something
about
my
giving
up
my
place
?
<EOS>
oh
no
!
<EOS>
I
shall
hold
it
fast
;
"
and
her
little
finger
emphatically
tighten
on
mine
.
  
<EOS>
"
think
of
my
marry
you
to
be
keep
by
you
,
monsieur
!
<EOS>
I
could
not
do
it
;
and
how
dull
my
day
would
be
!
<EOS>
You
would
be
away
teach
in
close
,
noisy
school
-
room
,
from
morning
till
evening
,
and
I
should
be
linger
at
home
,
unemployed
and
solitary
;
I
should
get
depressed
and
sullen
,
and
you
would
soon
tire
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
france
,
you
could
read
and
study
 
two
thing
you
like
so
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
monsieur
,
I
could
not
;
I
like
a
contemplative
life
,
but
I
like
an
active
life
better
;
I
must
act
in
some
way
,
and
act
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
take
notice
,
monsieur
,
that
people
who
be
only
in
each
other
's
company
for
amusement
,
never
really
like
each
other
so
well
,
or
esteem
each
other
so
highly
,
as
those
who
work
together
,
and
perhaps
suffer
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
speak
God
's
truth
,
"
say
I
at
last
,
"
and
you
shall
have
your
own
way
,
for
it
be
the
good
way
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
a
reward
for
such
ready
consent
,
give
me
a
voluntary
kiss
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
some
hesitation
,
natural
to
a
novice
in
the
art
of
kissing
,
she
bring
her
lip
into
very
shy
and
gentle
contact
with
my
forehead
;
I
take
the
small
gift
as
a
loan
,
and
repay
it
promptly
,
and
with
generous
interest
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
not
whether
france
be
really
much
alter
since
the
time
I
first
see
her
;
but
,
as
I
look
at
her
now
,
I
feel
that
she
be
singularly
change
for
me
;
the
sad
eye
,
the
pale
cheek
,
the
dejected
and
joyless
countenance
I
remember
as
her
early
attribute
,
be
quite
go
,
and
now
I
see
a
face
dress
in
grace
;
smile
,
dimple
,
and
rosy
tint
round
its
contour
and
brighten
its
hue
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
accustom
to
nurse
a
flattering
idea
that
my
strong
attachment
to
her
prove
some
particular
perspicacity
in
my
nature
;
she
be
not
handsome
,
she
be
not
rich
,
she
be
not
even
accomplish
,
yet
be
she
my
life
's
treasure
;
I
must
then
be
a
man
of
peculiar
discernment
.
<EOS>
to
-
night
my
eye
open
on
the
mistake
I
have
make
;
I
begin
to
suspect
that
it
be
only
my
taste
which
be
unique
,
not
my
power
of
discover
and
appreciate
the
superiority
of
moral
worth
over
physical
charm
.
<EOS>
for
me
Frances
have
physical
charm
:
in
her
there
be
no
deformity
to
get
over
;
none
of
those
prominent
defect
of
eye
,
tooth
,
complexion
,
shape
,
which
hold
at
bay
the
admiration
of
the
bold
male
champion
of
intellect
(
for
woman
can
love
a
downright
ugly
man
if
he
be
but
talented
)
;
have
she
be
either
"
edentee
,
myope
,
rugueuse
,
ou
bossue
,
"
my
feeling
towards
her
may
still
have
be
kindly
,
but
they
could
never
have
be
impassione
;
I
have
affection
for
the
poor
little
misshapen
Sylvie
,
but
for
her
I
could
never
have
have
love
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
france
'
mental
point
have
be
the
first
to
interest
me
,
and
they
still
retain
the
strong
hold
on
my
preference
;
but
I
like
the
grace
of
her
person
too
.
<EOS>
I
derive
a
pleasure
,
purely
material
,
from
contemplate
the
clearness
of
her
brown
eye
,
the
fairness
of
her
fine
skin
,
the
purity
of
her
well
-
set
tooth
,
the
proportion
of
her
delicate
form
;
and
that
pleasure
I
could
ill
have
dispense
with
.
<EOS>
It
appear
,
then
,
that
I
too
be
a
sensualist
,
in
my
temperate
and
fastidious
way
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
reader
,
during
the
last
two
page
I
have
be
give
you
honey
fresh
from
flower
,
but
you
must
not
live
entirely
on
food
so
luscious
;
taste
then
a
little
gall
 
<EOS>
just
a
drop
,
by
way
of
change
.
  
<EOS>
at
a
somewhat
late
hour
I
return
to
my
lodging
:
have
temporarily
forget
that
man
have
any
such
coarse
care
as
those
of
eat
and
drink
,
I
go
to
bed
fast
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
excite
and
in
action
all
day
,
and
have
taste
no
food
since
eight
that
morning
;
besides
,
for
a
fortnight
past
,
I
have
know
no
rest
either
of
body
or
mind
;
the
last
few
hour
have
be
a
sweet
delirium
,
it
would
not
subside
now
,
and
till
long
after
midnight
,
break
with
troubled
ecstacy
the
rest
I
so
much
need
.
<EOS>
at
last
I
doze
,
but
not
for
long
;
it
be
yet
quite
dark
when
I
awoke
,
and
my
waking
be
like
that
of
Job
when
a
spirit
pass
before
his
face
,
and
like
him
,
"
the
hair
of
my
flesh
stand
up
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
continue
the
parallel
,
for
in
truth
,
though
I
see
nothing
,
yet
"
a
thing
be
secretly
bring
unto
me
,
and
mine
ear
receive
a
little
thereof
;
there
be
silence
,
and
I
hear
a
voice
,
"
say
 
"
in
the
midst
of
life
we
be
in
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
that
sound
,
and
the
sensation
of
chill
anguish
accompany
it
,
many
would
have
regard
as
supernatural
;
but
I
recognize
it
at
once
as
the
effect
of
reaction
.
<EOS>
man
be
ever
clog
with
his
mortality
,
and
it
be
my
mortal
nature
which
now
falter
and
plain
;
my
nerve
,
which
jar
and
give
a
false
sound
,
because
the
soul
,
of
late
rush
headlong
to
an
aim
,
have
overstrain
the
body
's
comparative
weakness
.
<EOS>
a
horror
of
great
darkness
fall
upon
me
;
I
feel
my
chamber
invade
by
one
I
have
know
formerly
,
but
have
think
for
ever
depart
.
<EOS>
I
be
temporarily
a
prey
to
hypochondria
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
be
my
acquaintance
,
nay
,
my
guest
,
once
before
in
boyhood
;
I
have
entertain
her
at
bed
and
board
for
a
year
;
for
that
space
of
time
I
have
her
to
myself
in
secret
;
she
lie
with
me
,
she
eat
with
me
,
she
walk
out
with
me
,
show
me
nook
in
wood
,
hollow
in
hill
,
where
we
could
sit
together
,
and
where
she
could
drop
her
drear
veil
over
me
,
and
so
hide
sky
and
sun
,
grass
and
green
tree
;
take
me
entirely
to
her
death
-
cold
bosom
,
and
hold
me
with
arm
of
bone
.
<EOS>
what
tale
she
would
tell
me
at
such
hour
!
<EOS>
what
song
she
would
recite
in
my
ear
!
<EOS>
how
she
would
discourse
to
me
of
her
own
country
 
<EOS>
the
grave
 
<EOS>
and
again
and
again
promise
to
conduct
me
there
ere
long
;
and
,
draw
me
to
the
very
brink
of
a
black
,
sullen
river
,
show
me
,
on
the
other
side
,
shore
unequal
with
mound
,
monument
,
and
tablet
,
stand
up
in
a
glimmer
more
hoary
than
moonlight
.
<EOS>
"
Necropolis
!
<EOS>
"
she
would
whisper
,
point
to
the
pale
pile
,
and
add
,
"
It
contain
a
mansion
prepare
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
but
my
boyhood
be
lonely
,
parentless
;
uncheere
by
brother
or
sister
;
and
there
be
no
marvel
that
,
just
as
I
rise
to
youth
,
a
sorceress
,
find
me
lose
in
vague
mental
wandering
,
with
many
affection
and
few
object
,
glow
aspiration
and
gloomy
prospect
,
strong
desire
and
slender
hope
,
should
lift
up
her
illusive
lamp
to
me
in
the
distance
,
and
lure
me
to
her
vaulted
home
of
horror
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
her
spell
then
have
power
;
but
now
,
when
my
course
be
widen
,
my
prospect
brightening
;
when
my
affection
have
find
a
rest
;
when
my
desire
,
fold
wing
,
weary
with
long
flight
,
have
just
alight
on
the
very
lap
of
fruition
,
and
nestle
there
warm
,
content
,
under
the
caress
of
a
soft
hand
 
<EOS>
why
do
hypochondria
accost
me
now
?
  
<EOS>
I
repulse
her
as
one
would
a
dreaded
and
ghastly
concubine
come
to
embitter
a
husband
's
heart
toward
his
young
bride
;
in
vain
;
she
keep
her
sway
over
me
for
that
night
and
the
next
day
,
and
eight
succeed
day
.
<EOS>
afterwards
,
my
spirit
begin
slowly
to
recover
their
tone
;
my
appetite
return
,
and
in
a
fortnight
I
be
well
.
<EOS>
I
have
go
about
as
usual
all
the
time
,
and
have
say
nothing
to
anybody
of
what
I
feel
;
but
I
be
glad
when
the
evil
spirit
depart
from
me
,
and
I
could
again
seek
Frances
,
and
sit
at
her
side
,
free
from
the
dreadful
tyranny
of
my
demon
.
    
<EOS>
one
fine
,
frosty
Sunday
in
November
,
Frances
and
I
take
a
long
walk
;
we
make
the
tour
of
the
city
by
the
Boulevards
;
and
,
afterwards
,
france
be
a
little
tired
,
we
sit
down
on
one
of
those
wayside
seat
place
under
the
tree
,
at
interval
,
for
the
accommodation
of
the
weary
.
<EOS>
Frances
be
tell
me
about
Switzerland
;
the
subject
animate
her
;
and
I
be
just
think
that
her
eye
speak
full
as
eloquently
as
her
tongue
,
when
she
stop
and
remark
    
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
,
there
be
a
gentleman
who
know
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
look
up
<EOS>
;
three
fashionably
dress
man
be
just
then
pass
 
Englishmen
,
I
know
by
their
air
and
gait
as
well
as
by
their
feature
;
in
the
tall
of
the
trio
<EOS>
I
at
once
recognize
Mr.
Hunsden
;
he
be
in
the
act
of
lift
his
hat
to
Frances
;
afterwards
,
he
make
a
grimace
at
me
,
and
pass
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
a
person
I
know
in
England
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
he
bow
to
me
?
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
he
do
know
you
,
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
,
monsieur
?
"
<EOS>
(
She
still
call
me
"
monsieur
"
;
I
could
not
persuade
her
to
adopt
any
more
familiar
term
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
not
read
the
expression
of
his
eye
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
of
his
eye
?
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
what
do
they
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
to
you
they
say
,
"
how
do
you
do
,
Wilhelmina
Crimsworth
?
"
to
me
,
"
so
you
have
find
your
counterpart
at
last
;
there
she
sit
,
the
female
of
your
kind
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
monsieur
,
you
could
not
read
all
that
in
his
eye
;
he
be
so
soon
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
read
that
and
more
,
Frances
;
I
read
that
he
will
probably
call
on
me
this
evening
,
or
on
some
future
occasion
shortly
;
and
I
have
no
doubt
he
will
insist
on
be
introduce
to
you
;
shall
I
bring
him
to
your
room
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
please
,
monsieur
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
objection
;
I
think
,
indeed
,
I
should
rather
like
to
see
him
nearer
;
he
look
so
original
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
I
have
anticipate
,
Mr.
Hunsden
come
that
evening
.
<EOS>
the
first
thing
he
say
be
:
    
"
You
need
not
begin
boast
,
Monsieur
le
Professeur
<EOS>
;
I
know
about
your
appointment
to
 
College
,
and
all
that
;
Brown
have
tell
me
.
"
<EOS>
then
he
intimate
that
he
have
return
from
Germany
but
a
day
or
two
since
;
afterwards
,
he
abruptly
demand
whether
that
be
Madame
Pelet
-
Reuter
with
whom
he
have
see
me
on
the
Boulevards
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
utter
a
rather
emphatic
negative
,
but
on
second
thought
I
check
myself
,
and
,
seem
to
assent
,
ask
what
he
think
of
her
?
  
<EOS>
"
as
to
her
,
I
will
come
to
that
directly
;
but
first
I
have
a
word
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
see
you
be
a
scoundrel
;
you
have
no
business
to
be
promenade
about
with
another
man
's
wife
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
have
sounder
sense
than
to
get
mix
up
in
foreign
hodge
-
podge
of
this
sort
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
the
lady
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
too
good
for
you
evidently
;
she
be
like
you
,
but
something
well
than
you
 
no
beauty
,
though
;
yet
when
she
rise
(
for
I
look
back
to
see
you
both
walk
away
)
<EOS>
I
think
her
figure
and
carriage
good
.
<EOS>
these
foreigner
understand
grace
.
<EOS>
what
the
devil
have
she
do
with
Pelet
?
<EOS>
She
have
not
be
marry
to
him
three
month
 
<EOS>
he
must
be
a
spoon
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
would
not
let
the
mistake
go
too
far
;
I
do
not
like
it
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
pelet
?
<EOS>
how
your
head
run
on
Mons
.
<EOS>
and
Madame
Pelet
!
<EOS>
You
be
always
talk
about
them

I
wish
to

<EOS>

<EOS>
Hunsden
unconsciously
lay
stress
on
the
word
caste
,
and
,
in
fact
,
republican
,
lord
-
hater
as
he
be

Hunsden
be
as
proud
of
his
old
  
shire
blood
,
of
his
descent
and
family
standing
,
respectable
and
respect
through
long
generation
back
,
as
any
peer

<EOS>
Hunsden
would
as
little
have
think
of
take
a
wife
from
a
caste
inferior
to
his
own
,
as
a
Stanley
would
think
of
mate
with
a
Cobden

<EOS>
I
enjoy
the
surprise
I
should
give
;
I
enjoy
the
triumph
of
my
practice
over
his
theory
;
and
lean
over
the
table
,
and
utter
the
word
slowly
but
with
repressed
glee
,
I
say
concisely
    
"
<EOS>
She

mender

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hunsden
examine
me
.
<EOS>
He
do
not

he
be
surprised
,
but
surprise
he
be
;
he
have
his
own
notion
of
good
breeding
.
<EOS>
I
see
he
suspect
I
be
go
to
take
some
very
rash
step
;
but
repress
declamation
or
remonstrance
,
he
only
answer
    
"
<EOS>
well
,
you
be
the
good
judge
of
your
own

<EOS>
a
lace
-
mender
may
make
a
good

as
well
as

but
of
course
you
have
take
care
to
ascertain
thoroughly
that
since

she

I
can
not

you

"
  
<EOS>
after
sit
in
silence
a
little
while
longer
,
Hunsden
rise
,
and
be
quietly
bid
me
good
evening
;
the
polite
,
considerate
manner
in
which
he
offer
me
his
hand
(
a
thing
he
have
never
do
before
)
,
convince
me
that
he
think
I
have
make
a
terrible
fool
of
myself
;
and
that

ruin

throw
away
as
I
be

it
be
no

indulgence

forbearance

<EOS>
"
good

in

soft

his

look
benevolently
compassionate

"
<EOS>
good
night

<EOS>
I
wish
you

your

much
prosperity

and
I
hope
she
will
satisfy
your
fastidious
soul

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
much
ado
to
refrain
from
laugh
as
I
beheld
the
magnanimous
pity
of
his
mien
;
maintaining
,
however
,
a
grave
air
,
I
say
:
    
"

<EOS>
yes
 
if
it
would
be
convenient

I
should
like
to
see
her
 
<EOS>

.
"
He
hesitate
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
on
no
account
wish
to
intrude
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
come
,
then
,
"
say
I.
We
set
out
.
<EOS>
Hunsden
no
doubt
regard
me
as
a
rash
,
imprudent
man
,
thus
to
show
my
poor
little
grisette
sweetheart
,
in
her
poor
little
unfurnished
grenier
;
but
he
prepare
to
act
the
real
gentleman
,
have
,
in
fact
,
the
kernel
of
that
character
,
under
the
harsh
husk
it
please
him
to
wear
by
way
of
mental
mackintosh
.
<EOS>
He
talk
affably
,
and
even
gently
,
as
we
go
along
the
street
;
he
have
never
be
so
civil
to
me
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
We
reach
the
house
,
enter
,
ascend
the
stair
;
on
gain
the
lobby
,
Hunsden
turn
to
mount
a
narrow
stair
which
lead
to
a
high
story
;
I
see
his
mind
be
bent
on
the
attic
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
,
Mr.
Hunsden
,
"
say
I
quietly
,
tap
at
Frances
'
door
.
<EOS>
He
turn
;
in
his
genuine
politeness
he
be
a
little
disconcert
at
have
make
the
mistake
;
his
eye
revert
to
the
green
mat
,
but
he
say
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
We
walk
in
,
and
Frances
rise
from
her
seat
near
the
table
to
receive
us
;
her
mourning
attire
give
her
a
recluse
,
rather
conventual
,
but
withal
very
distinguished
look
;
its
grave
simplicity
add
nothing
to
beauty
,
but
much
to
dignity
;
the
finish
of
the
white
collar
and
manchette
suffice
for
a
relief
to
the
merino
gown
of
solemn
black
;
ornament
be
forswear
.
<EOS>
france
curtsy
with
sedate
grace
,
look
,
as
she
always
do
,
when
one
first
accost
her
,
more
a
woman
to
respect
than
to
love
;
I
introduce
Mr.
Hunsden
,
and
she
express
her
happiness
at
make
his
acquaintance
in
French
.
<EOS>
the
pure
and
polished
accent
,
the
low
yet
sweet
and
rather
full
voice
,
produce
their
effect
immediately
;
Hunsden
speak
French
in
reply
;
I
have
not
hear
him
speak
that
language
before
;
he
manage
it
very
well
.
<EOS>
I
retire
to
the
window
-
seat
;
Mr.
Hunsden
,
at
his
hostess
's
invitation
,
occupy
a
chair
near
the
hearth
;
from
my
position
I
could
see
them
both
,
and
the
room
too
,
at
a
glance
.
<EOS>
the
room
be
so
clean
and
bright
,
it
look
like
a
little
polished
cabinet
;
a
glass
fill
with
flower
in
the
centre
of
the
table
,
a
fresh
rise
in
each
china
cup
on
the
mantelpiece
<EOS>
give
it
an
air
of
FETE
.
<EOS>
france
be
serious
,
and
Mr.
Hunsden
subdue
,
but
both
mutually
polite
;
they
get
on
at
the
French
swimmingly
:
ordinary
topic
be
discuss
with
great
state
and
decorum
<EOS>
;
I
think
I
have
never
see
two
such
model
of
propriety
,
for
Hunsden
(
thank
to
the
constraint
of
the
foreign
tongue
)
be
oblige
to
shape
his
phrase
,
and
measure
his
sentence
,
with
a
care
that
forbid
any
eccentricity
.
<EOS>
at
last
England
be
mention
,
and
Frances
proceed
to
ask
question
.
<EOS>
animate
by
degree
,
she
begin
to
change
,
just
as
a
grave
night
-
sky
change
at
the
approach
of
sunrise
:
first
it
seem
as
if
her
forehead
clear
,
then
her
eye
glitter
,
her
feature
relaxed
,
and
become
quite
mobile
;
her
subdue
complexion
grow
warm
and
transparent
;
to
me
,
she
now
look
pretty
;
before
,
she
have
only
look
ladylike
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
many
thing
to
say
to
the
Englishman
just
fresh
from
his
island
-
country
,
and
she
urge
him
with
an
enthusiasm
of
curiosity
,
which
ere
long
thaw
Hunsden
's
reserve
as
fire
thaw
a
congealed
viper
.
<EOS>
I
use
this
not
very
flattering
comparison
because
he
vividly
remind
me
of
a
snake
wake
from
torpor
,
as
he
erect
his
tall
form
,
rear
his
head
,
before
a
little
declined
,
and
put
back
his
hair
from
his
broad
Saxon
forehead
,
show
unshaded
the
gleam
of
almost
savage
satire
which
his
interlocutor
's
tone
of
eagerness
and
look
of
ardour
have
suffice
at
once
to
kindle
in
his
soul
and
elicit
from
his
eye
:
he
be
himself
;
as
Frances
be
herself
,
and
in
none
but
his
own
language
would
he
now
address
her
.
  
<EOS>
"

I

why

it
possible

off
from

startling
emphasis

deign

slight
glance
of
admiration

He
like
something
strong
,
whether
in
man

woman
;
he
like
whatever
dare
to
clear
conventional
limit
.
<EOS>
He
have
never
before
hear
a
lady
say
"
hell
"
with
that
uncompromising
sort
of
accent
,

the
sound
please
him
from
a
lady
's
lip

he
would
fain
have
have
france
to
strike
the
string
again
,
but
it
be
not
in
her
way

<EOS>
the
display
of
eccentric
vigour
never
give
her
pleasure

it
only
sound
in
her
voice
or
flash
in
her
countenance

extraordinary
circumstance

those
generally
painful
 
force
it
out

depth

latent

to
me
,
once

twice

she
have
in

uttered
venturous
thought
in

language
;
but
when
the
hour
of
such
manifestation
be
past

I
could
not
recall
it

it
come
of
itself

itself
depart

put
by
soon
with
a
smile
,

recur
to
the

<EOS>
one
January
morning
 
the
first
of
the
new

<EOS>
holiday
 
<EOS>
I
go
in
a
fiacre
,
accompany
only
by
M.
Vandenhuten
,
to
the
Rue
Notre
Dame
aux
Neiges
,
and
have
alight
alone
and
walk
upstairs
<EOS>
,
I
find
Frances
apparently
wait
for
me
,
dress
in
a
style
scarcely
appropriate
to
that
cold
,
bright
,
frosty
day
.
<EOS>
never
till
now
have
I
see
her
attire
in
any
other
than
black
or
sad
-
coloured
stuff
;
and
there
she
stand
by
the
window
,
clothe
all
in
white
,
and
white
of
a
most
diaphanous
texture
;
her
array
be
very
simple
,
to
be
sure
,
but
it
look
imposing
and
festal
because
it
be
so
clear
,
full
,
and
float
;
a
veil
shadow
her
head
,
and
hang
below
her
knee
;
a
little
wreath
of
pink
flower
fasten
it
to
her
thickly
tresse
grecian
plait
,
and
thence
it
fall
softly
on
each
side
of
her
face
.
<EOS>
singular
to
state
,
she
be
,
or
have
be
cry
;
when
I
ask
her
if
she
be
ready
,
she
say
"
yes
,
monsieur
,
"
with
something
very
like
a
check
sob
;
and
when
I
take
a
shawl
,
which
lie
on
the
table
,
and
fold
it
round
her
,
not
only
do
tear
after
tear
course
unbidden
down
her
cheek
,
but
she
shake
to
my
ministration
like
a
reed
.
<EOS>
I
say
I
be
sorry
to
see
her
in
such
low
spirit
,
and
request
to
be
allow
an
insight
into
the
origin
thereof
.
<EOS>
She
only
say
,
"
It
be
impossible
to
help
it
,
"
and
then
voluntarily
,
though
hurriedly
,
put
her
hand
into
mine
,
accompany
me
out
of
the
room
,
and
run
downstairs
with
a
quick
,
uncertain
step
,
like
one
who
be
eager
to
get
some
formidable
piece
of
business
over
.
<EOS>
I
put
her
into
the
fiacre
.
<EOS>
M.
Vandenhuten
receive
her
,
and
seat
her
beside
himself
;
we
drive
all
together
to
the
protestant
chapel
,
go
through
a
certain
service
in
the
Common
Prayer
Book
,
and
she
and
I
come
out
married
.
<EOS>
M.
Vandenhuten
have
give
the
bride
away
.
  
<EOS>
We
take
no
bridal
trip
;
our
modesty
,
screen
by
the
peaceful
obscurity
of
our
station
,
and
the
pleasant
isolation
of
our
circumstance
,
do
not
exact
that
additional
precaution
.
<EOS>
We
repair
at
once
to
a
small
house
I
have
take
in
the
faubourg
near

that
part
of

city
where
the

<EOS>
three

pretty

<EOS>
It
be
snow
fast

the

turn
out
wild

the

Our

ourselves
to
labour

<EOS>
both
my

the
notion
that
we

destine

earn
our

by
exertion

and
that
of
the
most
assiduous
kind

<EOS>
Our

every
morning
at
eight
o'clock

not
meet

till
five
P.M.

into
what
sweet
rest
do
the
turmoil
of
each
busy
day
decline

<EOS>
look
down
the
vista
of
memory

I
see
the
evening
pass
in
that
little
parlour
like

peculiar

she
have
be

long
on
a

and
at
last
,
have
come
to
a
conclusion
,
wish
to
test
its
soundness
by
the
touchstone
of
my
judgment
:
    
"
I

vital

her

so
unaffectedly

suavely
respectful

that
my

expand

We

Ere

there
,
preserve
pure
and
dewy
under
the
umbrage
of
later
growth
and
hardier
nature
:
perhaps
I
only
in
the
world
know
the
secret
of
their
existence
,
but
to
me
they
be
ever
ready
to
yield
an
exquisite
fragrance
and
present
a
beauty
as
chaste
as
radiant
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
daytime
my
house
and
establishment
be
conduct
by
Madame
the
directress
,
a
stately
and
elegant
woman
,
bear
much
anxious
thought
on
her
large
brow
;
much
calculated
dignity
in
her
serious
mien
:
immediately
after
breakfast
I
use
to
part
with
this
lady
;
I
go
to
my
college
,
she
to
her
schoolroom
;
return
for
an
hour
in
the
course
of
the
day
,
I
find
her
always
in
class
,
intently
occupy
;
silence
,
industry
,
observance
,
attend
on
her
presence
.
<EOS>
when
not
actually
teach
,
she
be
overlook
and
guide
by
eye
and
gesture
;
she
then
appear
vigilant
and
solicitous
.
<EOS>
when
communicate
instruction
,
her
aspect
be
more
animate
;
she
seem
to
feel
a
certain
enjoyment
in
the
occupation
.
<EOS>
the
language
in
which
she
address
her
pupil
,
though
simple
and
unpretending
,
be
never
trite
or
dry
;
she
do
not
speak
from
routine
formula
 
<EOS>
she
make
her
own
phrase
as
she
go
on
,
and
very
nervous
and
impressive
phrase
they
frequently
be
;
often
,
when
elucidate
favourite
point
of
history
,
or
geography
,
she
would
wax
genuinely
eloquent
in
her
earnestness
.
<EOS>
Her
pupil
,
or
at
least
the
eld
and
more
intelligent
amongst
them
,
recognize
well
the
language
of
a
superior
mind
;
they
feel
too
,
and
some
of
them
receive
the
impression
of
elevated
sentiment
;
there
be
little
fondling
between
mistress
and
girl
,
but
some
of
france
'
pupil
in
time
learn
to
love
her
sincerely
,
all
of
them
behold
her
with
respect
;
her
general
demeanour
towards
them
be
serious
;
sometimes
benignant
when
they
please
her
with
their
progress
and
attention
,
always
scrupulously
refined
and
considerate
.
<EOS>
in
case
where
reproof
or
punishment
be
call
for
she
be
usually
forbear
enough
;
but
if
any
take
advantage
of
that
forbearance
,
which
sometimes
happen
,
a
sharp
,
sudden
and
lightning
-
like
severity
teach
the
culprit
the
extent
of
the
mistake
commit
.
<EOS>
sometimes
a
gleam
of
tenderness
soften
her
eye
and
manner
,
but
this
be
rare
;
only
when
a
pupil
be
sick
,
or
when
it
pine
after
home
,
or
in
the
case
of
some
little
motherless
child
,
or
of
one
much
poor
than
its
companion
,
whose
scanty
wardrobe
and
mean
appointment
bring
on
it
the
contempt
of
the
jewelled
young
countess
and
silk
-
clothe
miss
.
<EOS>
over
such
feeble
fledgling
the
directress
spread
a
wing
of
kindly
protection
:
it
be
to
their
bedside
she
come
at
night
to
tuck
them
warmly
in
;
it
be
after
them
she
look
in
winter
to
see
that
they
always
have
a
comfortable
seat
by
the
stove
;
it
be
they
who
by
turn
be
summon
to
the
salon
to
receive
some
little
dole
of
cake
or
fruit
 
to
sit
on
a
footstool
at
the
fireside
 
to
enjoy
home
comfort
,
and
almost
home
liberty
,
for
an
evening
together
 
to
be
speak
to
gently
and
softly
,
comfort
,
encourage
,
cherish
 
and
when
bedtime
come
,
dismiss
with
a
kiss
of
true
tenderness
.
<EOS>
as
to
Julia

of

<EOS>
Mathilde
de
,
heiress
of
a
belgian
count
,
and
sundry
other
child
of
patrician
race
,
the
directress
be
careful
of
them
as
of
the
other
,
anxious
for
their
progress
,
as
for
that
of
the
rest
 
<EOS>
but
it
never
seem
to
enter
her
head
to
distinguish
them
by
a
mark
of
preference
;
one
girl
of
noble
blood
she
love
dearly
 
a
young
irish
baroness
 
lady
Catherine
;
but
it
be
for
her
enthusiastic
heart
and
clever
head
,
for
her
generosity
and
her
genius
,
the
title
and
rank
go
for
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
My
afternoon
be
spend
also
in
college
,
with
the
exception
of
an
hour
that
my
wife
daily
exact
of
me
for
her
establishment
,
and
with
which
she
would
not
dispense
.
<EOS>
She
say
that
I
must
spend
that
time
amongst
her
pupil
to
learn
their
character
,
to
be
AU
COURANT
with
everything
that
be
pass
in
the
house
,
to
become
interested
in
what
interest
<EOS>
her
,
to
be
able
to
give
her
my
opinion
on
knotty
point
when
she
require
it
,
and
this
she
do
constantly
,
never
allow
my
interest
in
the
pupil
to
fall
asleep
,
and
never
make
any
change
of
importance
without
my
cognizance
and
consent
.
<EOS>
She
delight
to
sit
by
me
when
I
give
my
lesson
(
lesson
in
literature
)
,
her
hand
fold
on
her
knee
,
the
most
fixedly
attentive
of
any
present
.
<EOS>
She
rarely
address
me
in
class
;
when
she
do
it
be
with
an
air
of
marked
deference
;
it
be
her
pleasure
,
her
joy
to
make
me
still
the
master
in
all
thing
.
  
<EOS>
at
six
o'clock
P.M.
<EOS>
my
daily
labour
cease
.
<EOS>
I
then
come
home
,
for
my
home
<EOS>
be
my
heaven
;
ever
at
that
hour
,
as
I
enter
our
private
sitting
-
room
,
the
lady
-
directress
vanish
from
before
my
eye
,
and
Frances
Henri
,
my
own
little
lace
-
mender
,
be
magically
restore
to
my
arm
;
much
disappointed
she
would
have
be
if
her
master
have
not
be
as
constant
to
the
tryst
as
herself
,
and
if
his
truthfull
kiss
have
not
be
prompt
to
answer
her
soft
,
"
bon
soir
,
monsieur
.
"
  
<EOS>
talk
French
to
me
<EOS>
she
would
,
and
<EOS>
many
a
punishment
she
have
have
for
her
wilfulness
.
<EOS>
I
fear
the
choice
of
chastisement
must
have
be
injudicious
,
for
instead
of
correct
the
fault
,
it
seem
to
encourage
its
renewal
.
<EOS>
Our
evening
be
our
own
;
that
recreation
be
necessary
to
refresh
our
strength
for
the
due
discharge
of
our
duty
;
sometimes
we
spend
them
all
in
conversation
,
and
my
young
Genevese
,
now
that
she
be
thoroughly
accustomed
to
her
english
professor
,
now
that
she
love
him
too
absolutely
to
fear
him
much
,
repose
in
him
a
confidence
so
unlimited
that
topic
of
conversation
could
no
more
be
want
with
him
than
subject
for
communion
with
her
own
heart
.
<EOS>
in
those
moment
,
happy
as
a
bird
with
its
mate
,
she
would
show
me
what
she
have
of
vivacity
,
of
mirth
,
of
originality
in
her
well
-
dower
nature
.
<EOS>
She
would
show
,
too
,
some
store
of
raillery
,
of
"
malice
,
"
and
would
vex
,
tease
,
pique
me
sometimes
about
what
she
call
my
"
bizarrerie
anglaise
,
"
my
"
caprice
insulaire
,
"
with
a
wild
and
witty
wickedness
that
make
a
perfect
white
demon
of
her
while
it
last
.
<EOS>
this
be
rare
,
however
,
and
the
elfish
freak
be
always
short
:
sometimes
when
drive
a
little
hard
in
the
war
of
word
 
for
her
tongue
do
ample
justice
to
the
pith
,
the
point
,
the
delicacy
of
her
native
French
,
in
which
language
she
always
attack
me
 
<EOS>
I
use
to
turn
upon
her
with
my
old
decision
,
and
arrest
bodily
the
sprite
that
tease
me
.
<EOS>
vain
idea
!
<EOS>
no
sooner
have
I
grasp
hand
or
arm
than
the
elf
be
go
;
the
provocative
smile
quench
in
the
expressive
brown
eye
,
and
a
ray
of
gentle
homage
shone
under
the
lid
in
its
place
.
<EOS>
I
have
seize
a
mere
vexing
fairy
,
and
find
a
submissive
and
supplicate
little
mortal
woman
in
my
arm
.
<EOS>
then
I
make
her
get
a
book
,
and
read
English
to
me
for
an
hour
by
way
of
penance
.
<EOS>
I
frequently
dose
her
with
Wordsworth
in
this
way
,
and
Wordsworth
steady
her
soon
;
she
have
a
difficulty
in
comprehend
his
deep
,
serene
,
and
sober
mind
;
his
language
,
too
,
be
not
facile
to
her
;
she
have
to
ask
question
,
to
sue
for
explanation
,
to
be
like
a
child
and
a
novice
,
and
to
acknowledge
me
as
her
senior
and
director
.
<EOS>
Her
instinct
instantly
penetrate
and
possess
the
meaning
of
more
ardent
and
imaginative
writer
.
<EOS>
Byron
excite
her
;
Scott
she
love
;
Wordsworth
only
she
puzzle
at
,
wonder
over
,
and
hesitate
to
pronounce
an
opinion
upon
.
  
<EOS>
but
whether
she
read
to
me
,
or
talk
with
me
;
whether
she
tease
me
in
French
,
or
entreat
me
in
English
;
whether
she
jest
with
wit
,
or
inquire
with
deference
;
narrate
with
interest
,
or
listen
with
attention
;
whether
she
smile
at
me
or
on
me
,
always
at
nine
o'clock
I
be
leave
abandon
.
<EOS>
She
would
extricate
herself
from
my
arm
,
quit
my
side
,
take
her
lamp
,
and
be
go
.
<EOS>
Her
mission
be
upstairs
;
I
have
follow
her
sometimes
and
watch
her
.
<EOS>
first
she
open
the
door
of
the
dortoir
(
the
pupil
'
chamber
)
,
noiselessly
she
glide
up
the
long
room
between
the
two
row
of
white
bed
,
survey
all
the
sleeper
;
if
any
be
wakeful
,
especially
if
any
be
sad
,
speak
to
them
and
soothe
them
;
stand
some
minute
to
ascertain
that
all
be
safe
and
tranquil
;
trim
the
watch
-
light
which
burn
in
the
apartment
all
night
,
then
withdraw
,
close
the
door
behind
her
without
sound
.
<EOS>
thence
she
glide
to
our
own
chamber
;
it
have
a
little
cabinet
within
;
this
she
seek
;
there
,
too
,
appear
a
bed
,
but
one
,
and
that
a
very
small
one
;
her
face
(
the
night
I
follow
and
observe
her
)
change
as
she
approach
this
tiny
couch
;
from
grave
it
warm
to
earnest
;
she
shade
with
one
hand
the
lamp
she
hold
in
the
other
;
she
bend
above
the
pillow
and
hang
over
a
child
asleep
;
its
slumber
(
that
evening
at
least
,
and
usually
,
I
believe
)
be
sound
and
calm
;
no
tear
wet
its
dark
eyelash
;
no
fever
heat
its
round
cheek
;
no
ill
dream
discompose
its
budding
feature
.
<EOS>
france
gaze
,
she
do
not
smile
,
and
yet
the
deep
delight
fill
,
flush
her
face
;
feel
pleasurable
,
powerful
,
work
in
her
whole
frame
,
which
still
be
motionless
.
<EOS>
I
see
,
indeed
,
her
heart
heave
,
<EOS>
her
lip
be
a
little
apart
,
her
breathing
grow
somewhat
hurried
;
the
child
smile
;
then
at
last
the
mother
smile
too
,
and
say
in
low
soliloquy
,
"
God
bless
my
little
son
!
"
<EOS>
She
stoop
closer
over
him
,
breathe
the
softest
of
kiss
on
his
brow
,
cover
his
minute
hand
with
hers
,
and
at
last
start
up
and
come
away
.
<EOS>
I
regain
the
parlour
before
her
.
<EOS>
enter
it
two
minute
later
she
say
quietly
as
she
put
down
her
extinguished
lamp
    
"

to

because
I
be
to

a
good

<EOS>
what

have
be
have

envious

careless

<EOS>
a
profligate

a

a

or
a
tyrant
 
be
another
question
,
and
one
which
I
once
propound
to
her
.
<EOS>
Her
answer
,
give
after
some
reflection
,
be
    
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
try
to
endure
the

<EOS>
yes

I
would
have
go
back
;
again
assure
myself
whether

vice

say
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
ask
me

I
would
have
an
answer
,
because
I
see
a
strange
kind
of
spirit
in
her
eye
,
whose
voice
I
determine
to
waken

<EOS>
"
Monsieur

"
<EOS>
She
stop
,
her
voice
be
cut
off
,
her
eye
suddenly
suffuse
.
<EOS>
She
and
I
be
stand
side
by
side
;
she
throw
her
arm
round
me
,
and
strain
me
to
her
heart
with
passionate
earnestness

<EOS>
the
energy
of
her

glow
in
her
dark
and
then
dilate
eye
,
and
crimson
her
animated
cheek
;
her
look
and
movement
be
like
inspiration
;
in
one
there
be
such
a
flash
,
in
the
other
such
a
power
.
<EOS>
half
an
hour
afterwards
,
when
she
have
become
calm

I
ask
where
all
that
wild
vigour
be
go
which
have
transform
her
ere

make
her
glance
so
thrilling

ardent
 
her

so
rapid

<EOS>
She
look
down
,
smile
softly
and
passively
:
    
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
where
it
be
go
,
monsieur

"
say
she
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
know
that

whenever
it
be

it
will
come
back
again

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
behold
us
now
at
the
close
of
the
ten
year
,
and
we
have
realize
an
independency
.
<EOS>
the
rapidity
with
which
we
attain
this
end
have
its
origin
in
three
reason
:
firstly
,
we
work
so
hard
for
it
;
secondly
,
we
have
no
incumbrance
to
delay
success
;
thirdly
,
as
soon
as
we
have
capital
to
invest
,
two
well
-
skilled
counsellor
,
one
in
Belgium
,
one
in
England
,
viz

<EOS>
Vandenhuten
and
Hunsden
,
give
us
each
a
word
of
advice
as
to
the
sort
of

to
be
choose
.
<EOS>
the
suggestion
make
be
judicious
;
and
,
be
promptly
act
on
,
<EOS>
the
result
prove
gainful
 
<EOS>
I
need
not
say
how
gainful
;
I
communicate
detail
to
Messrs.
Vandenhuten
and
Hunsden
;
nobody

be

them

<EOS>
account
be
wind
up

and
our
professional
connection
dispose
of
<EOS>
,
we
both
agree
that
,
as
mammon
be
not
our
master
,
nor
his
service
that
in
which
we
desire
to
spend
our
life
;
as
our
desire
be
temperate
,
and
our
habit
unostentatious
,
we
have
now
abundance
to
live
on
 
abundance
to
leave
our
boy
;
and
should
besides
always
have
a
balance
on
hand
,
which
,
properly
manage
by
right
sympathy
and
unselfish
activity
,
may
help
philanthropy
in
her
enterprise
,
and
put
solace
into
the
hand
of
charity
.
  
<EOS>
to
England
we
now
resolve
to
take
wing
;
we
arrive
there
safely
;
france
realize
the
dream
of
her
lifetime
.
<EOS>
We
spend
a
whole
summer
and
autumn
in
travel
from
end
to
end
of
the
british
island
,
and
afterwards
pass
a
winter
in
London
.
<EOS>
then
we
think
it
high
time
to
fix
our
residence
.
<EOS>
My
heart
yearn
towards
my
native
county
of
  
shire
;
and
it
be
in
shire
I
now
live
;
it
be
in
the
library
of
my
own
home
I
be
now
write
.
<EOS>
that
home
lie
amid
a
sequestered
and
rather
hilly
region
,
thirty
mile
remove
from
X
 
;
a
region
whose
verdure
the
smoke
of
mill
have
not
yet
sully
,
whose
water
still
run
pure
,
whose
swell
of
moorland
preserve
in
some
ferny
glen
that
lie
between
them
the
very
primal
wildness
of
nature
,
her
moss
,
her
bracken
,
her
blue
-
bell
,
her
scent
of
reed
and
heather
,
her
free
and
fresh

<EOS>
My
house
be
a
picturesque
and
not
too
spacious
dwelling
,
with
low
and
long
window
,
a
trellised
and
leaf
-
veil
porch
over
the
front
door
,
just
now
,
on
this
summer
evening
,
look
like
an
arch
of
rose
and
ivy
.
<EOS>
the
garden
be
chiefly
lay
out
in
lawn
,
form
of
the
sod
of
the
hill
,
with
herbage
short
and
soft
as
moss
,
full
of
its
own
peculiar
flower
,
tiny
and
starlike
,
imbed
in
the
minute
embroidery
of
their
fine
foliage
.
<EOS>
at
the
bottom
of
the
sloping
garden
there
be
a
wicket
,
which
open
upon
a
lane
as
green
as
the
lawn
,
very
long
,
shady
,
and
little
frequented
;
on
the
turf
of
this
lane
generally
appear
the
first
daisy
of
spring
 
whence
its
name
 
Daisy
Lane
;
serve
also
as
a
distinction
to
the
house

<EOS>
It
terminate
(
the
lane
I
mean
)
in
a
valley
full
of
wood
;
which
wood
 
chiefly
oak
and
beech
 
spread
shadowy
about
the
vicinage
of
a
very
old
mansion
,
one
of
the
Elizabethan
structure
,
much
large
,
as
well
as
more
antique
than
Daisy

the
property
and

of
an
individual
familiar

to

<EOS>
yes

Yorke
Hunsden
,
still

;
never

I
suppose
,
have
yet
find
his
ideal
,
though
I
know
at
least
a
score
of
young
lady
within
a
circuit
of
forty
mile
,
who
would
be
willing
to
assist
him
in
the
search

<EOS>
the
estate
fall
to
him
by
the
death
of
his
father
,
five
year
since
;
he
have
give
up
trade
,
after
have
make
by
it
sufficient
to
pay
off
some
incumbrance
by
which
the
family
heritage
be
burden
.
<EOS>
I
say
he
abide
here
,
but
I
do
not
think
he
be
resident
above
five
month
out
of
the
twelve
;
he
wander
from
land
to
land
,
and
spend
some
part
of
each
winter
in
town
:
he
frequently
bring
visitor
with
him
when
he
come
to
  
shire
,
and
these
visitor
be
often
foreigner
;
sometimes
he
have
a
german
metaphysician
,
sometimes
a
french
savant
;
he
have
once
a
dissatisfied
and
savage
-
look
Italian
,
who
neither
sing
nor
play
,
and
of
whom
Frances
affirm
that
he
have
"
tout
<EOS>
l'air
d'un
conspirateur
.
"
  
<EOS>
what
English
guest
Hunsden
invite
,
be
all
either
man
of
Birmingham
or
Manchester
 
hard
man
,
seemingly
knit
up
in
one
thought
,
whose
talk
be
of
free
trade
.
<EOS>
the
foreign
visitor
,
too
,
be
politician
;
they
take
a
wide
theme
 
<EOS>
european
progress
 
<EOS>
the
spread
of
liberal
sentiment
over
the
continent
;
on
their
mental
tablet
,
the
name
of
Russia
,
Austria
,
and
the
Pope
,
be
inscribe
in
red
ink
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
some
of
them
talk
vigorous
sense
 
yea
<EOS>
,
I
have
be
present
at
polyglot
discussion
in
the
old
,
oak
-
line
dining
-
room
at
Hunsden
Wood
,
where
a
singular
insight
be
give
of
the
sentiment
entertain
by
resolute
mind
respect
old
northern
despotism
,
and
old
southern
superstition
:
<EOS>
also
,
I
have
hear
much
twaddle
,
enounce
chiefly
in
French
and
Deutsch
,
but
let
that
pass
.
<EOS>
Hunsden
himself
tolerate
the
drivel
theorist
;
with
the
practical
man
he
seem
leagued
hand
and
heart
.
  
<EOS>
when
Hunsden
be
stay
alone
at
the
Wood
(
which
seldom
happen
)
<EOS>
he
generally
find
his
way
two
or
three
time
a
week
to
Daisy
Lane
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
philanthropic
motive
for
come
to
smoke
his
cigar
in
our
porch
on
summer
evening
;
he
say
he
do
it
to
kill
the
earwigs
amongst
the
rose
,
with
which
insect
,
but
for
his
benevolent
fumigation
,
he
intimate
we
should
certainly
be
overrun
.
<EOS>
on
wet
day
,
too
,
we
be
almost
sure
to
see
him
;
accord
to
him
,
it
get
on
time
to
work
me
into
lunacy
by
tread
on
my
mental
corn
,
or
to
force
from
Mrs.
Crimsworth
revelation
of
the
dragon
within
her
,
by
insult
the
memory
of
Hofer
and
tell
.
  
<EOS>
We
also
go
frequently
to
Hunsden
Wood
,
and
both
I
and
Frances
relish
a
visit
there
highly
.
<EOS>
if
there
be
other
guest
,
their
character
be
an
interesting
study
;
their
conversation
be
exciting
and
strange
;
the
absence
of
all
local
narrowness
both
in
the
host
and
his
choose
society
give
a
metropolitan
,
almost
a
cosmopolitan
freedom
and
largeness
to
the
talk
.
<EOS>
Hunsden
himself
be
a
polite
man
in
his
own
house
:
<EOS>
he
have
,
when
he
choose
to
employ
it
,
an
inexhaustible
power
of
entertain
guest
;
<EOS>
his
very
mansion
too
be
interesting
,
the
room
look
story
,
the
passage
legendary
,
the
low
-
ceile
chamber
,
with
their
long
row
of
diamond
-
pan
lattice
,
have
an
old
-
world
,
haunt
air
:
in
his
travel
he
have
collect
store
of
article
of
VERTU
,
which
be
well
and
tastefully
disposed
in
his
panelled
or
tapestrie
room
:
I
have
see
there
one
or
two
picture
,
and
one
or
two
piece
of
statuary
which
many
an
aristocratic
connoisseur
may
have
envy
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
and
Frances
have
dine
and
spend
an
evening
with
Hunsden
,
he
often
walk
home
with
us
.
<EOS>
His
wood
be
large
,
and
some
of
the
timber
be
old
and
of
huge
growth
.
<EOS>
there
be
wind
way
in
it
which
,
pursue
through
glade
and
brake
,
make
the
walk
back
to
Daisy
Lane
a
somewhat
long
one
.
<EOS>
many
a
time
,
when
we
have
have
the
benefit
of
a
full
moon
,
and
when
the
night
have
be
mild
and
balmy
,
when
,
moreover
,
a
certain
nightingale
have
be
singe
,
and
a
certain
stream
,
hide
in
alder
,
have
lend
the
song
<EOS>
a
soft
accompaniment
,
the
remote
church
-
bell
of
the
one
hamlet
in
a
district
of
ten
mile
,
have
toll
midnight
<EOS>
ere
the
lord
of
the
wood
<EOS>
leave
us
at
our
porch
.
<EOS>
free
-
flow
be
his
talk
at
such
hour
,
and
far
more
quiet
and
gentle
than
in
the
day
-
time
and
before
number
.
<EOS>
He
would
then
forget
politic
and
discussion
,
and
would
dwell
on
the
past
time
of
his
house
,
on
his
family
history
,
on
himself
and
his
own
feeling
 
subject
each
and
all
invest
with
a
peculiar
zest
,
for
they
be
each
and
all
unique
.
<EOS>
one
glorious
night
in
June
,
after
I
have
be
taunt
him
about
his
ideal
bride
and
ask
him
when
she
would
come
and
graft
her
foreign
beauty
on
the
old
Hunsden
oak
,
he
answer
suddenly
    
"
<EOS>
You
call
her
ideal
;
but
see
,
here
be
her
shadow
;
and
there
can
not
be
a
shadow
without
a
substance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
lead
us
from
the
depth
of
the
"
wind
way
"
into
a
glade
from
whence
the
beech
withdraw
,
leave
it
open
to
the
sky
;
an
unclouded
moon
pour
her
light
into
this
glade
,
and
Hunsden
hold
out
under
her
beam
an
ivory
miniature
.
  
<EOS>
france
,
with
eagerness
,
examine
it
first
;
then
she
give
it
to
me
 
still
,
however
,
push
her
little
face
close
to
mine
,
and
seek
in
my
eye
what
I
think
of
the
portrait
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
represent
a
very
handsome
and
very
individual
-
look
female
face
,
with
,
as
he
have
once
say
,
"
straight
and
harmonious
feature
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
dark
;
the
hair
,
raven
-
black
,
sweep
not
only
from
the
brow
,
but
from
the
temple
 
seem
thrust
away
carelessly
,
as
if
such
beauty
dispense
with
,
nay
,
despised
arrangement
.
<EOS>
the
italian
eye
look
straight
into
you
,
and
an
independent
,
determined
eye
it
be
;
the
mouth
be
as
firm
as
fine
;
the
chin
ditto
.
<EOS>
on
the
back
of
the
miniature
be
gild
"
Lucia
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
a
real
head
,
"
be
my
conclusion
.
  
<EOS>
Hunsden
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
,
"
he
reply
.
<EOS>
"
all
be
real
in
Lucia
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
she
be
somebody
you
would
have
like
to
marry
 
but
could
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
certainly
have
like
to
marry
her
,
and
that
I
have
not
do
so
be
a
proof
that
I
COULD
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
repossess
himself
of
the
miniature
,
now
again
in
Frances
'
hand
,
and
put
it
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
think
of
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
ask
of
my
wife
,
as
he
button
his
coat
over
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
Lucia
once
wear
chain
and
break
them
,
"
be
the
strange
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
matrimonial
chain
,
"
she
add
,
correct
herself
,
as
if
she
fear

social
chain
of

the

be

have
make
an
effort
,
and
a
successful
and
triumphant
effort
,
to
wrest
some
vigorous
and
value
faculty
from
insupportable
constraint
;
and
when
Lucia
's
faculty
get
free
,
I
be
certain
it
spread
wide

carry
her
high

<EOS>
"
Lucia
have
tread
the
stage
,
"
continue

<EOS>
"
You
never
seriously
think
of

her

you
admire
her
originality

you

you
worship
her

be

I
be

she
fill

that
this
be
a
sweet
summer
evening
;
it
be
 
there
have
be
a
series
of
lovely
day
,
and
this
be
the
lovely
;
the
hay
be
just
carry
from
my
field
,
its
perfume
still
linger
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
france
propose
to
me
,
an
hour
or
two
since
,
to
take
tea
out
on
the
lawn
;
I
see
the
round
table
,
load
with
china
,
place
under
a
certain
beech
;
Hunsden
be
expect
 
<EOS>
nay
,
I
hear
he
be
come
 
<EOS>
there
be
his
voice
,
lay
down
the
law
on
some
point
with
authority
;
that
of
Frances
reply
;
she
oppose
him
of
course
.
<EOS>
They
be
dispute
about
Victor
,
of
whom
Hunsden
affirm
that
his
mother
be
make
a
milksop
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Crimsworth
retaliate
:
    
"
well
a
thousand
time
he
should
be
a
milksop
than
what
he
,
Hunsden
,
call
"
a
fine
lad
;
"
and
moreover
she
say
that
if
Hunsden
be
to
become
a
fixture
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
be
not
a
mere
comet
,
come
and
go
,
no
one
know
how
,
when
,
where
,
or
why
,
she
should
be
quite
uneasy
till
she
have
get
Victor
away
to
a
school
at
least
a
hundred
mile
off
;
for
that
with
his
mutinous
maxim
and
unpractical
dogmas
,
he
would
ruin
a
score
of
child
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
word
to
say
of
<EOS>
Victor
ere
<EOS>
I
shut
this
manuscript
in
my
desk
 
<EOS>
but
it
must
be
a
brief
one
,
<EOS>
for
I
hear
the
tinkle
of
silver
on
porcelain
.
  
<EOS>
Victor
be
as
little
of
a
pretty
child
as
I
be
of
a
handsome
man
,
or
his
mother
of
a
fine
woman
;
he
be
pale
and
spare
,
with
large
eye
,
as
dark
as
those
of
Frances
,
and
as
deeply
set
as
mine
.
<EOS>
His
shape
be
symmetrical
enough
,
but
slight
;
his
health
be
good
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
a
child
smile
less
than
he
do
,
nor
one
who
knit
such
a
formidable
brow
when
sit
over
a
book
that
interest
him
,
or
while
listen
to
tale
of
adventure
,
peril
,
or
wonder
,
narrate
by
his
mother
,
Hunsden
,
or
myself
.
<EOS>
but
though
still
,
he
be
not
unhappy
 
though
serious
,
not
morose
;
he
have
a
susceptibility
to
pleasurable
sensation
almost
too
keen
,
for
it
amount
to
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
He
learn
to
read
in
the
old
-
fashioned
way
out
of
a
spelling
-
book
at
his
mother
's
knee
,
and
as
he
get
on
without
drive
by
that
method
,
she
think
it
unnecessary
to
buy
him
ivory
letter
,
or
to
try
any
of
the
other
inducement
to
learn
now
deem
indispensable
.
<EOS>
when
he
could
read
,
he
become
a
glutton
of
book
,
and
be
so
still
.
<EOS>
His
toy
have
be
few
,
and
he
have
never
want
more
.
<EOS>
for
those
he
possess
,
he
seem
to
have
contract
a
partiality
amount
to
affection
;
this
feeling
,
direct
towards
one
or
two
live
animal
of
the
house
,
strengthen
almost
to
a
passion
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Hunsden
give
him
a
mastiff
cub
,
which
he
call
Yorke
,
after
the
donor
;
it
grow
to
a
superb
dog
,
whose
fierceness
,
however
,
be
much
modify
by
the
companionship
and
caress
of
its
young
master
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
nowhere
,
do
nothing
without
Yorke
;
Yorke
lie
at
his
foot
while
he
learn
his
lesson
,
play
with
him
in
the
garden
,
walk
with
him
in
the
lane
and
wood
,
sit
near
his
chair
at
meal
,
be
feed
always
by
his
own
hand
,
be
the
first
thing
he
seek
in
the
morning
,
the
last
he
leave
at
night
.
<EOS>
Yorke
accompany
Mr.
Hunsden
one
day
to
X
 
,
and
be
bite
in
the
street
by
a
dog
in
a
rabid
state
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Hunsden
have
bring
him
home
,
and
have
inform
me
of
the
circumstance
,
I
go
into
the
yard
and
shoot
him
where
he
lie
lick
his
wound
:
he
be
dead
in
an
instant
;
he
have
not
see
me
level
the
gun
;
I
stand
behind
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
scarcely
be
ten
minute
in
the
house
,
when
my
ear
be
strike
with
sound
of
anguish
<EOS>
:
I
repair
to
the
yard
once
more
,
for
they
proceed
thence
.
<EOS>
Victor
be
kneel
beside
his
dead
mastiff
,
bent
over
it
,
embrace
its
bull
-
like
neck
,
and
lose
in
a
passion
of
the
wildest
woe
:
he
see
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
papa
,
I
will
never
forgive
you
!
<EOS>
I
will
never
forgive
you
!
"
<EOS>
be
his
exclamation
.
<EOS>
"
You
shoot
yorke
 
I
see
it
from
the
window
.
<EOS>
I
never
believe
you
could
be
so
cruel
 
<EOS>
I
can
love
you
no
more
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
much
ado
to
explain
to
him
,
with
a
steady
voice
,
the
stern
necessity
of
the
deed
;
he
still
,
with
that
inconsolable
and
bitter
accent
which
I
can
not
render
,
but
which
pierce
my
heart
,
repeat
    
"
He
may
have
be
cure
 
<EOS>
you
should
have
try
 
you
should
have
burn
the
wound
with
a
hot
iron
,
or
cover
it
with
caustic
.
<EOS>
You
give
no
time
;
and
now
it
be
too
late
 
<EOS>
he
be
dead
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
sink
fairly
down
on
the
senseless
carcase
;
I
wait
patiently
a
long
while
,
till
his
grief
have
somewhat
exhaust
him
;
and
then
I
lift
him
in
my
arm
and
carry
him
to
his
mother
,
sure
that
she
would
comfort
him
best
.
<EOS>
She
have
witness
the
whole
scene
from
a
window
;
she
would
not
come
out
for
fear
of
increase
my
difficulty
by
her
emotion
,
but
she
be
ready
now
to
receive
him
.
<EOS>
She
take
him
to
her
kind
heart
,
and
on
to
her
gentle
lap
;
console
him
but
with
her
lip
,
her
eye
,
her
soft
embrace
,
for
some
time
;
and
then
,
when
his
sobs
diminish
,
tell
him
that
Yorke
have
feel
no
pain
in
die
,
and
that
if
he
have
be
leave
to
expire
naturally
,
his
end
would
have
be
most
horrible
;
above
all
,
she
tell
him
that
I
be
not
cruel
(
for
that
idea
<EOS>
seem
to
give
exquisite
pain
to
poor
Victor
)
,
that
it
be
my
affection
for
Yorke
and
him
which
have
make
me
act
so
,
and
that
I
be
now
almost
heart
-
break
to
see
him
weep
thus
bitterly
.
  
<EOS>
Victor
would
have
be
no
true
son
of
his
father
,
have
these
consideration
,
these
reason
,
breathe
in
so
low
,
so
sweet
a
tone
 
married
to
caress
so
benign
,
so
tender
 
to
look
so
inspired
with
pity
sympathy
 
produce
no
effect
on
him
.
<EOS>
They
do
produce
an
effect
:
he
grow
calm
,
rest
his
face
on
her
shoulder
,
and
lie
still
in
her
arm
.
<EOS>
look
up
,
shortly
,
he
ask
his
mother
to
tell
him
over
again
what
she
have
say
about
Yorke
have
suffer
no
pain
,
and
my
not
be
cruel
;
the
balmy
word
be
repeat
,
he
again
pillow
his
cheek
on
her
breast
,
and
be
again
tranquil
.
  
<EOS>
some
hour
after
,
he
come
to
me
in
my
library
,
ask
if
I
forgave
him
,
and
desire
to
be
reconcile
.
<EOS>
I
draw
the
lad
to
my
side
,
and
there
I
keep
him
a
good
while
,
and
have
much
talk
with
him
,
in
the
course
of
which
he
disclose
many
point
of
feeling
and
think
I
approve
of
in
my
son
.
<EOS>
I
find
,
it
be
true
,
few
element
of
the
"
good
fellow
"
or
the
"
fine
fellow
"
in
him
;
scant
sparkle
of
the
spirit
which
love
to
flash
over
the
wine
cup
,
or
which
kindle
the
passion
to
a
destroy
fire
;
but
I
see
in
the
soil
of
his
heart
healthy
and
swell
germ
of
compassion
,
affection
,
fidelity
.
<EOS>
I
discover
in
the
garden
of
his
intellect
a
rich
growth
of
wholesome
principle
 
reason
,
justice
,
moral
courage
,
promise
,
if
not
blight
,
a
fertile
bearing
.
<EOS>
so
I
bestow
on
his
large
forehead
,
and
on
his
cheek
 
still
pale
with
tear
 
a
proud
and
contented
kiss
,
and
send
him
away
comfort
.
<EOS>
yet
I
see
him
the
next
day
lay
on
the
mound
under
which
Yorke
have
be
bury
,
his
face
cover
with
his
hand
;
he
be
melancholy
for
some
week
,
and
more
than
a
year
elapse
before
he
would
listen
to
any
proposal
of
have
another
dog
.
  
<EOS>
Victor
learn
fast
.
<EOS>
He
must
soon
go
to
Eton
,
where
,
I
suspect
,
his
first
year
or
two
will
be
utter
wretchedness
:
to
leave
me
,
his
mother
,
and
his
home
,
will
give
his
heart
an
agonize
wrench
;
then
,
the
fagging
will
not
suit
him
 
but
emulation
,
thirst
after
knowledge
,
the
glory
of
success
,
will
stir
and
reward
him
in
time
.
<EOS>
meantime
,
I
feel
in
myself
a
strong
repugnance
to
fix
the
hour
which
will
uproot
my
sole
olive
branch
,
and
transplant
it
far
from
me
;
and
,
when
I
speak
to
france
on
the
subject
,
I
be
hear
with
a
kind
of
patient
pain
,
as
though
I
allude
to
some
fearful
operation
,
at
which
her
nature
shudder
,
but
from
which
her
fortitude
will
not
permit
her
to
recoil
.
<EOS>
the
step
must
,
however
,
be
take
,
and
it
shall
be
;
for
,
though
france
will
not
make
a
milksop
of
her
son
,
she
will
accustom
him
to
a
style
of
treatment
,
a
forbearance
,
a
congenial
tenderness
,
he
will
meet
with
from
none
else
.
<EOS>
She
see
,
as
I
also
see
,
a
something
in
Victor
's
temper
 
a
kind
of
electrical
ardour
and
power
 
which
emit
,
now
and
then
,
ominous
spark
;
Hunsden
call
it
his
spirit
,
and
say
it
should
not
be
curb
.
<EOS>
I
call
it
the
leaven
of
the
offending
Adam
,
and
consider
that
it
should
be
,
if
not
WHIPPED
out
of
him
,
at
least
soundly
discipline
;
and
that
he
will
be
cheap
of
any
amount
of
either
bodily
or
mental
suffering
which
will
ground
him
radically
in
the
art
of
self
-
control
.
<EOS>
france
give
this
something
in
her
son
's
marked
character
no
name
;
but
when
it
appear
in
the
grinding
of
his
tooth
,
in
the
glittering
of
his
eye
,
in
the
fierce
revolt
of
feeling
against
disappointment
,
mischance
,
sudden
sorrow
,
or
suppose
injustice
,
she
fold
him
to
her
breast
,
or
take
him
to
walk
with
her
alone
in
the
wood
;
then
she
reason
with
him
like
any
philosopher
,
and
to
reason
Victor
be
ever
accessible
;
then
she
look
at
him
with
eye
of
love
,
and
by
love
Victor
can
be
infallibly
subjugate
;
but
will
reason
or
love
be
the
weapon
with
which
in
future
the
world
will
meet
his
violence
?
<EOS>
oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
for
that
flash
in
his
black
eye
 
for
that
cloud
on
his
bony
brow
 
for
that
compression
of
his
statuesque
lip
,
the
lad
will
some
day
get
blow
instead
of
blandishment
 
kick
instead
of
kiss
;
then
for
the
fit
of
mute
fury
which
will
sicken
his
body
and
madden
his
soul
;
then
for
the
ordeal
of
merited
and
salutary
suffering
,
out
of
which
he
will
come
(
I
trust
)
<EOS>
a
wiser
and
a
well
man
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
him
now
;
he
stand
by
Hunsden
,
who
be
seat
on
the
lawn
under
the
beech
;
Hunsden
's
hand
rest
on
the
boy
's
collar
,
and
he
be
instill
God
know
what
principle
into
his
ear
.
<EOS>
Victor
look
well
just
now
,
for
he
listen
with
a
sort
of
smile
interest
;
he
never
look
so
like
his
mother
as
when
he
smile
 
pity
the
sunshine
break
out
so
rarely
!
<EOS>
Victor
have
a
preference
for
Hunsden
,
full
as
strong
as
I
deem
desirable
,
be
considerably
more
potent
,
decide
,
and
indiscriminate
,
than
any
I
ever
entertain
for
that
personage
myself
.
<EOS>
france
,
too
,
regard
it
with
a
sort
of
unexpressed
anxiety
;
while
her
son
lean
on
Hunsden
's
knee
,
or
rest
against
his
shoulder
,
she
rove
with
restless
movement
round
,
like
a
dove
guard
its
young
from
a
hovering
hawk
;
she
say
she
wish
Hunsden
have
child
of
his
own
,
for
then
he
would
better
know
the
danger
of
incite
their
pride
end
indulge
their
foible
.
  
<EOS>
france
approach
my
library
window
;
put
aside
the
honeysuckle
which
half
cover
it
,
and
tell
me
tea
be
ready
;
see
that
I
continue
busy
<EOS>
she
enter
the
room
,
come
near
me
quietly
,
and
put
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
est
trop
applique
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
soon
have
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
draw
a
chair
near
,
and
sit
down
to
wait
till
I
have
finish
;
her
presence
be
as
pleasant
to
my
mind
as
the
perfume
of
the
fresh
hay
and
spicy
flower
,
as
the
glow
of
the
westere
sun
,
as
the
repose
of
the
midsummer
eve
be
to
my
sense
.
  
<EOS>
but
Hunsden
come
;
I
hear
his
step
,
and
there
he
be
,
bend
through
the
lattice
,
from
which
he
have
thrust
away
the
woodbine
with
unsparing
hand
,
disturb
two
bee
and
a
butterfly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Crimsworth

<EOS>
I
say
,
Crimsworth
!
<EOS>
take
that
pen
out
of
his
hand
,
mistress
,
and
make
him
lift
up
his
head

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well

Hunsden

<EOS>
I
hear
you

I
be
at

<EOS>
your
brother
Ned
be
get
rich
than
Croesus
by
railway
speculation
;
they
call
him
in
the
Piece
Hall
a

and
I
have
hear

.
<EOS>
M.
and
Madame
Vandenhuten
and
<EOS>
Jean
Baptiste
talk
of
come
to
see
you
next
month
.
<EOS>
He
mention
the
Pelets
too
;
he
say
their
domestic
harmony
be
not
the
fine
in
the
world
,
but
in
business
they
be
do
"
on

"
which
circumstance
he
conclude
will
be
a
sufficient
consolation
to
both
for
any
little
crosse
in
the
affection

<EOS>
why
do
not
you
invite
the
Pelets
to
