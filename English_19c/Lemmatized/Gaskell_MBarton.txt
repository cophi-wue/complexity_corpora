MANCHESTER
SONG
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
some
field
near
Manchester
,
well
known
to
the
inhabitant
as
"
Green
Heys
field
,
"
through
which
run
a
public
footpath
to
a
little
village
about
two
mile
distant
.
 
<EOS>
in
spite
of
these
field
be
flat
,
and
low
,
nay
,
in
spite
of
the
want
of
wood
(
the
great
and
usual
recommendation
of
level
tract
of
land
)
,
there
be
a
charm
about
them
which
strike
even
the
inhabitant
of
a
mountainous
district
,
who
see
and
feel
the
effect
of
contrast
in
these
commonplace
but
thoroughly
rural
field
,
with
the
busy
,
bustle
manufacturing
town
he
leave
<EOS>
but
half
-
an
-
hour
ago
.
 
<EOS>
here
and
there
an
old
black
and
white
farmhouse
,
with
its
rambling
outbuilding
,
speak
of
other
time
and
other
occupation
than
those
which
now
absorb
the
population
of
the
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
here
in
their
season
may
be
see
the
country
business
of
haymaking
,
plough
,
etc
.
,
which
be
such
pleasant
mystery
for
townspeople
to
watch
:
and
here
the
artisan
,
deafen
with
noise
of
tongue
and
engine
,
may
come
to
listen
awhile
to
the
delicious
sound
of
rural
life
:
<EOS>
the
lowing
of
cattle
,
the
milkmaid
's
call
,
the
clatter
and
cackle
of
poultry
in
the
farmyard
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
wonder
,
then
,
that
these
field
be
popular
place
of
resort
at
every
holiday
time
;
and
you
would
not
wonder
,
if
you
could
see
,
or
I
properly
describe
,
the
charm
of
one
particular
stile
,
that
it
should
be
,
on
such
occasion
,
a
crowded
halt
place
.
 
<EOS>
close
by
it
be
a
deep
,
clear
pond
,
reflect
in
its
dark
green
depth
the
shadowy
tree
that
bend
over
it
to
exclude
the
sun
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
place
where
its
bank
be
shelve
be
on
the
side
next
to
a
rambling
farmyard
,
belong
to
one
of
those
old
world
,
gable
,
black
and
white
house
I
name
above
,
overlook
the
field
through
which
the
public
footpath
lead
.
 
<EOS>
the
porch
of
this
farmhouse
be
cover
by
a
rose
-
tree
;
and
the
little
garden
surround
it
be
crowd
with
a
medley
of
old
-
fashioned
herb
and
flower
,
plant
long
ago
,
when
the
garden
be
the
only
druggist
's
shop
within

grow
in
scrambling

,
balm
(
for

)
,
rosemary
,
pink

wallflower
,
onion
and
jessamine
,
in
most
republican
and
indiscriminate
order
.
 
<EOS>
this
farmhouse
and
garden
be
within
a
hundred
yard
of
the
stile
of
which
I
speak
,
lead
from
the
large
pasture
field
into
a
small
one
,
divide
by
a
hedge
of
hawthorn
and
blackthorn
;
and
near
this
stile
,
on
the
further
side
<EOS>
,
there
run
a
tale
that
primrose
may
often
be
find
,
and
occasionally
the
blue
sweet
violet
on
the
grassy
hedge
bank
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
it
be
on
a
holiday
grant
by
the
master
,
or
a
holiday
seize
in
right
of
nature
and
her
beautiful
spring
time
by
the
workman
,
but
one
afternoon
(
now
ten
or
a
dozen
year
ago
)
<EOS>
these
field
be
much
throng
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
early
May
evening
 
<EOS>
the
April
of
the
poet
;
for
heavy
shower
have
fall
all
the
morning
,
and
the
round
,
soft
,
white
cloud
which
be
blow
by
a
west
wind
over
the
dark
blue
sky
,
be
sometimes
vary
by
one
blacker
and
more
threatening
.
 
<EOS>
the
softness
of
the
day
tempt
forth
the
young
green
leave
,
which
almost
visibly
flutter
into
life
;
and
the
willow
,
which
that
morning
have
have
only
a
brown
reflection
in
the
water
below
,
be
now
of
that
tender
grey
-
green
which
blend
so
delicately
with
the
spring
harmony
of
colour
.
  
<EOS>
group
of
merry
and
somewhat
loud
-
talk
girl
,
whose
age
may
range
from
twelve
to
twenty
,
come
by
with
a
buoyant
step
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
most
of
them
factory
girl
,
and
wear
the
usual
out
-
of
-
door
dress
of
that
particular
class
of
maiden
;
namely
,
a
shawl
,
which
at
midday
or
in
fine
weather
be
allow
to
be
merely
a
shawl
,
but
towards
evening
,
if
the
day
be
chilly
,
become
a
sort
of
spanish
mantilla
or
Scotch
plaid
,
and
be
bring
over
the
head
and
hang
loosely
down
,
or
be
pin
under
the
chin
in
no
unpicturesque
fashion
.
  
<EOS>
Their
face
be
not
remarkable
for
beauty
;
indeed
,
they
be
below
the
average
,
with
one
or
two
exception
;
they
have
dark
hair
,
neatly
and
classically
arrange
,
dark
eye
,
but
sallow
complexion
and
irregular
feature
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
thing
to
strike
a
passer
-
by
be
an
acuteness
and
intelligence
of
countenance
,
which
have
often
be
notice
in
a
manufacturing
population
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
also
number
of
boy
,
or
rather
young
man
,
ramble
among
these
field
,
ready
to
bandy
joke
with
any
one
,
and
particularly
ready
to
enter
into
conversation
with
the
girl
,
who
,
however
,
hold
themselves
aloof
,
not
in
a
shy
,
but
rather
in
an
independent
way
,
assume
an
indifferent
manner
to
the
noisy
wit
or
obstreperous
compliment
of
the
lad
.
 
<EOS>
here
and
there
come
a
sober
,
quiet
couple
,
either
whisper
lover
,
or
husband
and
wife
,
as
the
case
may
be
;
and
if
the
latter
,
they
be
seldom
unencumbered
by
an
infant
,
carry
for
the
most
part
by
the
father
,
while
occasionally
even
three
or
four
<EOS>
little
toddler
have
be
carry
or
drag
thus
far
,
in
order
that
the
whole
family
may
enjoy
the
delicious
May
afternoon
together
.
  
<EOS>
some
time
in
the
course
of
that
afternoon
,
two
work
man
meet
with
friendly
greeting
at
the
stile
so
often
name
.
 
<EOS>
one
be
a
thorough
speciman
of
a
Manchester
man
;
bear
of
factory
worker
,
and
himself
breed
up
in
youth
,
and
live
in
manhood
,
among
the
mill
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
below
the
middle
size
and
slightly
make
;
there
be
almost
a
stunted
look
about
him
;
and
his
wan
,
colourless
face
give
you
the
idea
,
that
in
his
childhood
he
have
suffer
from
the
scanty
live
consequent
upon
bad
time
and
improvident
habit
.
 
<EOS>
His
feature
be
strongly
mark
,
though
not
irregular
,
and
their
expression
be
extreme
earnestness
;
resolute
either
for
good
or
evil
,
a
sort
of
latent
stern
enthusiasm
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
time
of
which
I
write
,
the
good
predominate
over
the
bad
in
the
countenance
,
and
he
be
one
from
whom
a
stranger
would
have
ask
a
favour
with
tolerable
faith
that
it
would
be
grant
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
accompany
by
his
wife
,
who
may
,
without
exaggeration
,
have
be
call
a
lovely
woman
,
although
now
her
face
be
swollen
with
crying
,
and
often
hide
behind
her
apron
.
<EOS>
She
have
the
fresh
beauty
of
the
agricultural
district
;
and
somewhat
of
the
deficiency
of
sense
in
her
countenance
,
which
be
likewise
characteristic
of
the
rural
inhabitant
in
comparison
with
the
native
of
the
manufacturing
town
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
far
advanced
in
pregnancy
,
which
perhaps
occasion
the
overpowering
and
hysterical
nature
of
her
grief
.
 
<EOS>
the
friend
whom
they
meet
be
more
handsome
and
less
sensible
-
look
than
the
man
I
have
just
describe
;
he
seem
hearty
and
hopeful
,
and
although
his
age
be
great
,
yet
there
be
far
more
of
youth
's
buoyancy
in
his
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
tenderly
carry
a
baby
in
arm
,
while
his
wife
,
a
delicate
,
fragile
-
look
woman
,
limp
in
her
gait
,
bear
another
of
the
same
age
;
little
,
feeble
twin
,
inherit
the
frail
appearance
of
their
mother
.
  
<EOS>
the
last
-
mention
man
be
the
first
to
speak
,
while
a
sudden
look
of
sympathy
dim
his
gladsome
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
John
,
how
go
it
with
you
?
"
<EOS>
and
in
a
low
voice
,
he
add
,
"
any
news
of
Esther
yet
?
"
<EOS>
meanwhile
the
wife
greet
each
other
like
old
friend
,
the
soft
and
plaintive
voice
of
the
mother
of
the
twin
seem
to
call
forth
only
fresh
sobs
from
Mrs.
Barton
.
  
<EOS>
"
come
,
woman
,
"
say
John
Barton
,
"
you
have
both
walk
far
enough
.
 
<EOS>
My
Mary
expect
to
have
her
bed
in
three
week
;
and
as
for
you
,
Mrs.
Wilson
,
you
know
you
be
but
a
cranky
sort
of
a
body
at
the
good
of
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
say
so
kindly
,
that
no
offence
could
be
take
.
"
<EOS>
sit
you
down
here
;
the
grass
be
well
nigh
dry
by
this
time
;
and
you
be
neither
of
you

folk
about

<EOS>
stay
,
"
he
add
,
with
some
tenderness
,
"
here
be
my
pocket
-
handkerchief
to
spread
under
you
to
save
the
gown
woman
always
think
so
much
on
;
and
now
,
Mrs.
Wilson
,
give
me
the
baby
,
I
may
as
well
carry
him
,
while
you
talk
and
comfort
my
wife
;
poor
thing
<EOS>
,
she
take
on
sadly
about
Esther
.
"
     
<EOS>
these
arrangement
be
soon
complete
;
the
two
woman
sit
down
on
the
blue
cotton
handkerchief
of
their
husband
,
and
the
latter
,
each
carry
a
baby
,
set
off
for
a
further
walk
;
but
as
soon
as
Barton
have
turn
his
back
upon
his
wife
,
his
countenance
fall
back
into
an
expression
of
gloom
.
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
have
hear
nothing
of
Esther
,
poor
lass
?
"
ask
Wilson
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
nor
shall
not
,
as
I
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
mind
be
,
she
be
go
off
with
somebody
.
 
<EOS>
My
wife
fret
and
think
she
be
drown
herself
,
but
<EOS>
I
tell
her
,
folk
do
not
care
to
put
on
their
good
clothe
to
drown
themselves
;
and
Mrs.
Bradshaw
(
where
she
lodge
,
you
know
)
say
the
last
time
she
set
eye
on
her
<EOS>
be
last
Tuesday
,
<EOS>
when
she
come
downstairs
,
dress
in
her
Sunday
gown
,
and
with
a
new
ribbon
in
her
bonnet
,
and
glove
on
her
hand
,
like
the
lady
she
be
so
fond
of
think
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
as
pretty
a
creature
as
ever
the
sun
shine
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
she
be
a
farrantly
*
lass
;
more
be
the
pity
now
,
"
add
Barton
,
with
a
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
see
them
<EOS>
Buckinghamshire
people
as
come
to
work
here
<EOS>
have
quite
a
different
look
with
them
to
us
Manchester
folk
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
see
among
the
Manchester
wench
such
fresh
rosy
cheek
,
or
such
black
lash
to
grey
eye
(
make
them
look
like
black
)
,
as
my
wife
and
Esther
have
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
seed
two
such
pretty
woman
for
sister
;
never
.
 
<EOS>
not
<EOS>
but
what
beauty
be
a
sad
snare
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
Esther
so
puff
up
,
that
there
be
no
hold
her
in
.
 
<EOS>
Her
spirit
be
always
up
,
if
I
speak
ever
so
little
in
the
way
of
advice
to
her
;
my
wife
spoil
her
,
it
be
true
,
for
you
see
she
be
so
much
old
than
Esther
<EOS>
,
she
be
more
like
a
mother
to
her
,
do
everything
for
her
.
"
     
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
she
ever
leave
you
,
"
observe
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
the
bad
of
factory
work
for
girl
.
 
<EOS>
They
can
earn
so
much
when
work
be
plenty
,
that
they
can
maintain
themselves
anyhow
.
 
<EOS>
My
Mary
shall
never
work
in
a
factory
,
that
I
be
determined
on
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
Esther
spend
her
money
in
dress
,
think
to
set
off
her
pretty
face
;
and
get
to
come
home
so
late
at
night
,
that
at
last
I
tell
her
my
mind
;
my
missis
think
I
speak
crossly
,
but
I
mean
right
,
for
I
love
Esther
,
if
it
be
only
for
Mary
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
esther
,
I
see
what
you
will
end
at
with
your
artificial
,
and
your
fly
-
away
veil
,
and
stop
out
when
honest
woman
be
in
their
bed
:
you
will
be
a
street
-
walker
,
Esther
,
and
then
,
do
not
you
go
to
think
I
will
have
you
darken
my
door
,
though
my
wife
be
your
sister
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
she
,
"
do
not
trouble
yourself
,
John
,
I
will
pack
up
and
be
off
now
,
for
I
will
never
stay
to
hear
myself
call
as
you
call
me

"
 
<EOS>
She
flush
up
like
a
turkey
-
cock
,
and
I
think
fire
would
come
out
of
her
eye
;
<EOS>
but
when
she
see
Mary
cry
(
for
Mary
can
not
abide
word
in
a
house
)
,
she
go
and
kiss
her
,
and
say
she
be
not
so
bad
as
I
think
her
.
 
<EOS>
so
we
talk
more
friendly
,
for
,
as
I
say
<EOS>
,
I
like
the
lass
well
enough
,
and
her
pretty
look
,
and
her
cheery
way
.
<EOS>
but
she
say
(
and
at
that
time
I
think
there
be
sense
in
what
she
say
)
<EOS>
we
should
be
much
well
friend
if
she
go
into
lodging
,
and
only
come
to
see
us
now
and
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
still
be
friendly
.
 
<EOS>
folk
say
you
would
cast
her
off
,
and
say
you
would
never
speak
to
her
again

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
folk
always
make
one
a
deal
bad

say
John
Barton
testily

"
She
come
many
a

she
come
to
drink
a
cup
of
tea
with
Mary
;
and
that
be
the
last
time
we
set
eye
on
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
she
any
way
different
in
her
manner
?
"
ask
Wilson
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
do
not
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
think
several
time
since
,
that
she
be
a
bit
quieter
,
and
more
womanly
-
like
;
more
gentle
,
and
more
blushing
,
and
not
so
riotous
and
noisy
.
 
<EOS>
She
come
in
towards
four
o'clock
,
when
afternoon
church
be
loose
,
and
she
go
and
hang
her
bonnet
up
on
the
old
nail
we
use
to
call
her
,
while
she
live
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
think
what
a
pretty
lass
she
be
,
as
she
sit
on
a
low
stool
by
Mary
,
who
be
rock
herself
,
and
in
rather
a
poor
way
.
 
<EOS>
She
laugh
and
cry
by
turn
,
but
all
so
softly
and
gently
,
like
a
child
,
that
I
could
not
find
in
my
heart
to
scold
her
,
especially
as
Mary
be
fret
already
.
 
<EOS>
one
thing
I
do
remember
I
do
say
,
and
pretty
sharply
too
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
our
little
Mary
by
the
waist
and
"
    
"
Thou
must
leave
off
call
her
"
little
"
Mary
<EOS>
,
she
be
grow
up
into
as
fine
a
lass
as
one
can
see
on
a
summer
's
day
;
more
of
her
mother
's
stock
than
thine
,
"
interrupt
Wilson
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
well
,
I
call
her
"
little
"
because
her
mother
's
name
be
Mary
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
be
say
,
she
take
Mary
in
a
coaxing
sort
of
way
,
and
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
"
say
she
,
"
what
should
you
think
if
I
send
for
you
some
day
and
make
a
lady
of
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
so
I
could
not
stand
such
talk
as
that
to
my
girl
,
and
I
say
,
"
thou'd
<EOS>
best
not
put
that
nonsense
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
the
girl
's
head
<EOS>
I
can
tell
thee
<EOS>
;
I
would
rather
see
her
earn
her
bread
by
the
sweat
of
brow
,
as
the
Bible
tell
her
she
should
do
,
ay
,
though
she
never
get
butter
to
her
bread
,
than
be
like
a
do
-
nothing
lady
,
worry
shopman
all
morning
,
and
screech
at
her
pianny
all
afternoon
,
and
go
to
bed
without
have
do
a
good
turn
to
any
one
of
God
's
creature
but
herself
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Thou
never
could
abide
the
gentlefolk
,
"
say
Wilson
,
half
amuse
at
his
friend
's
vehemence
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
what
good
have
they
ever
do
me
that
I
should
like
them
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Barton
,
the
latent
fire
light
up
his
eye
:
and
burst
forth
he
continue
,
"
if
I
be
sick
do
they
come
and
nurse
me

<EOS>
if
my
child
lie
die
(
as
poor
Tom
lie

with
his
white
wan

for

food

I

give
him

,
do
the
rich
man
bring
the
wine

broth
that
may
save
his

<EOS>
if
I
be
out

work
for
week
in

bad
time

winter
come

with

when
I
lie

and
Mary
(
bless
her

<EOS>
stand
fretting

as
I
know
she
will
fret

here
his
voice
falter
a
little
,

will
a
rich
lady
come

take
her
to
her

need

till
she
can
look

see
what
good

<EOS>
no

I
tell
you
it
be
the
poor
,
and
the
poor
only
,
as
do
such
thing
for
the
poor

<EOS>
do
not
think

come
over
me
with
th

old
tale

that
the
rich
know
nothing

the
trial
of
the

;
I
say
,
if

they
ought
to
know

<EOS>
We
be
their
slave
as
long
as
we
can
work
;
we
pile
up
their
fortune
with
the
sweat
of
our
brow
,
and
yet
we
be
to
live
as
separate
as
if
we
be
in
two
world
;
ay
,
as
separate
as
Dives
and
Lazarus
,
with
a
great
gulf
betwixt
us
:
<EOS>
but
I
know
who
be
good
off
then
,
"
and
he
wind
up
his
speech
with
a
low
chuckle
that
have
no
mirth
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
neighbour
,
"
say
Wilson
,
"
all
that
may
be
very
true
,
but
what
I
want
to
know
now
be
about
Esther
 
<EOS>
when
do
you
last
hear
of
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
she
take
leave
of
us
that
Sunday
night
in
a
very
loving
way
,
kiss
both
wife
Mary
,
and
daughter
Mary
(
if
I
must
not
call
her
"
little
"
)
,
and
shake
hand
with
me
;
but
all
in
a
cheerful
sort
of
manner
,
so
we
think
nothing
about
her
kiss
and
shake
.
 
<EOS>
but
on
Wednesday
night
come
Mrs.
Bradshaw
's
son
 
with
Esther
's
box
,
and
presently
Mrs.
Bradshaw
follow
with
the
key
;
and
when
we
begin
to
talk
,
we
find
Esther
tell
her
she
be
come
back
to
live
with
us
,
and
would
pay
her
week
's
money
for
not
give
notice
;
and
on
Tuesday
night
she
carry
off
a
little
bundle
<EOS>
(
her
good
clothe
be
on
her
back
,
as
I
say
before
)
and
tell
Mrs.
Bradshaw
not
to
hurry
herself
about
the
big
box
,
but
bring
it
when
she
have
time
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
of
course
,
she
think
she
should
find
Esther
with
us
;
and
when
she
tell
her
story
,
my
missis
set
up
such
a
screech
,
and
fall
down
in
a
dead
swoon
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
run
up
with
water
for
her
mother
,
and
I
think
so
much
about
my
wife
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
seem
to
care
at
all
for
Esther
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
next
day
I
ask
all
the
neighbour
(
both
our
own
and
Bradshaw
's
)
and
<EOS>
they
would
none
of
'em
hear
or
see
nothing
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
even
go
to
a
policeman
,
a
good
enough
sort
of
man
,
but
a
fellow
I
would
never
speak
to
before
because
of
his
livery
,
and
<EOS>
I
ask
him
if
his
"
cuteness
could
find
anything
out
for
us
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
believe
he
ask
other
policeman
;
and
one
on
'em
have
see
a
wench
,
like
our
Esther
,
walk
very
quickly
,
with
a
bundle
under
her
arm
,
on
Tuesday
night
,
toward
eight
o'clock
,
and
get
into
a
hackney
coach
,
near
Hulme
Church
,
and
we
do
not
know
th
'
number
,
and
can
not
trace
it
no
further
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
enough
for
the
girl
,
for
bad
's
come
over
her
,
one
way
or
another
,
but
I
be
sorry
for
my
wife
.
 
<EOS>
She
love
her
next
to
me
and
Mary
,
and
she
be
never
be
the
same
body
since
poor
Tom
's
death
.
<EOS>
however
,
let
's
go
back
to
them
;
your
old
woman
may
have
do
her
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
as
they
walk
homeward
with
a
brisker
pace
,
Wilson
express
a
wish
that
they
still
be
the
near
neighbour
they
once
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
still
our
Alice

in

cellar
under
No

14
,
in
Barber

and
if
you

speak
the
word
she
would
be
with
you
in
five
minute
to
keep
your
wife
company
when
she
be
lonesome

<EOS>
though
I
be
Alice

brother

and
perhaps
ought
not
to
say
it

I
will
say
there
be
none
more

She

<EOS>
with
a

<EOS>
Mrs.

know
manner
too
well
to
do
anything
but
sit
at
the
tea

table
and
make
tea
,
though
in
her
heart
she
long
to
be
able
to
superintend
the
frying
of
the
ham
,
and
cast
many
an
anxious
look
at
Mary

she
break

<EOS>
Jem
stand
awkwardly
lean
against
the
dresser
,
reply
rather
gruffly
to
his
aunt
's
speech
,
which
give
him
,
he
think
,
the
air
of
be
a
little
boy
;
whereas
he
consider
himself
as
a
young
man
,
and
not
so
very
young
neither
,
as
in
two
month
he
would
be
eighteen
.
<EOS>
Barton
vibrate
between
the
fire
and
the
tea

table
,
his
only
drawback
be
a
fancy
that
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
his
wife
's
face
flush
and
contract
as
if
in
pain
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
the
business
actually
begin
.
 
<EOS>
knife
and
fork
,
cup
and
saucer
make
a
noise
,
but
human
voice
be
still
,
for
human
being
be
hungry
and
have
no
time
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
first
broke
silence
;
hold
her
tea
-
cup
with
the
manner
of
one
propose
a
toast
,
she
say
,
"
here
be
to
absent
friend
.
 
<EOS>
friend
may
meet
,
but
mountain
never
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
an
unlucky
toast
or
sentiment
,
as
she
instantly
feel
.
 
<EOS>
every
one
thought
of
Esther
,
the
absent
Esther
;
and
Mrs.
Barton
put
down
her
food
,
and
could
not
hide
the
fast
-
drop
tear
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
could
have
bite
her
tongue
out
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
wet
blanket
to
the
evening
;
for
though
all
have
be
say
and
suggest
in
the
field
that
could
be
say
or
suggest
,
every
one
have
a
wish
to
say
something
in
the
way
of
comfort
to
poor
Mrs.
Barton
,
and
a
dislike
to
talk
about
anything
else
while
her
tear
fall
fast
and
scald
.
 
<EOS>
so
George
Wilson
,
his
wife
,
and
child
set
off
early
home
,
not
before
(
in
spite
of
mal

a

propos
speech

<EOS>
they
have
express
a
wish
that
such
meeting
may
often
take
place
,
and
not
before
John
Barton
have
give
his
hearty
consent
;
and
declare
that
as
soon
as
ever
his
wife
be
well
again
they
would
have
just
such
another
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
care
not
to
come
and
spoil
it
,
"
think
poor
Alice
,
and
go
up
to
Mrs.
Barton
<EOS>
,
she
take
her
hand
almost
humbly
,
and
say
,
"
You
do
not
know
how
sorry
I
be
<EOS>
I
say
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
to
her
surprise
,
a
surprise
that
bring
tear
of
joy
into
her
eye
,
Mary
Barton
put
her
arm
round
her
neck
,
and
kiss

<EOS>
"
You

while
the

,
leave

still
open
,
she
hear
the
cry
of
agony
,
which
resound
in
the
little
court
in
the
stillness
of
the
night

his
night

bell
,
and
still
longer
in
understand
who
it
be
that
make
this
sudden
call
upon

and
then
he
beg

to

in
order

Barton
absolutely
stamp
with
impatience
,
outside
the
doctor

door
,
before
he
come
down
;
and
walk
so
fast
homeward
,
that
the
medical

several
time
ask

to
go
slower

<EOS>
John
have
no
time
for
listening
.
 
<EOS>
He
open
the
latched
door
,
stay
not
to
light
a
candle
for
the
mere
ceremony
of
show
his
companion
up
the
stair
,
so
well
known
to
himself
;
but
,
in
two
minute
,
be
in
the
room
,
where
lie
the
dead
wife
,
whom
he
have
love
with
all
the
power
of
his
strong
heart
.
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
stumble
upstairs
by
the
fire
-
light
,
and
meet
the
awe
-
strike
look
of
the
neighbour
,
which
at
once
tell
him
the
state
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
the
room
be
still
,
as
he
,
with
habitual
tiptoe
step
,
approach
the
poor
frail
body
,
that
nothing
now
could
more
disturb
.
 
<EOS>
Her
daughter
knelt
by
the
bedside
,
her
face
bury
in
the
clothe
,
which
be
almost
cram
into
her
mouth
,
to
keep
down
the
choking
sobs
.
 
<EOS>
the
husband
stand
like
one
stupefy
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
question
the
neighbour
in
whisper
,
and
then
approach
Barton
,
say
,
"
You
must
go
downstairs
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
great
shock
,
but
bear
it
like
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
go
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
go
mechanically
and
sit
down
on
the
first
chair
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
hope
.
 
<EOS>
the
look
of
death
be
too
clear
upon
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
when
he
hear
one
or
two
unusual
noise
,
the
thought
burst
on
him
that
it
may
only
be
a
trance
,
a
fit
<EOS>
,
a
 
he
do
not
well
know
what
 
but
not
death
!
 
<EOS>
oh
,
not
death
!
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
start
up
to
go
up
-
stair
again
,
when
the
doctor
's
heavy
cautious
creaking
footstep
be
hear
on
the
stair
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
know
what
it
really
be
in
the
chamber
above
.
  
<EOS>
"
nothing
could
have
save
her
 
there
have
be
some
shock
to
the
system
"
 
a
nd
<EOS>
so
he
go
on
,
but
to
unheeding
ear
,
which
yet
retain
his
word
to
ponder
on
;
word
not
for
immediate
use
in
convey
sense
,
but
to
be
lay
by
,
in
the
store
-
house
of
memory
,
for
a
more
convenient
season
.
 
<EOS>
the
doctor
,
see
the
state
of
the
case
,
grieve
for
the
man
;
and
,
very
sleepy
,
think
it
best
to
go
,
and
accordingly
wish
him
good
-
night
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
answer
,
so
he
let
himself
out
;
and
Barton
sit
on
,
like
a
stock
or
a
stone
,
so
rigid
,
so
still
.
 
<EOS>
He
hear
the
sound
above
,
too
,
and
know
what
they
mean
.
 
<EOS>
He
hear
the
stiff
unseasoned
drawer
,
in
which
his
wife
keep
her
clothe
,
pull
open
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
the
neighbour
come
down
,
and
blunder
about
in
search
of
soap
and
water
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
well
what
she
want
,
and
why
she
want
them
,
but
he
do
not
speak
nor
offer
to
help
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
she
go
,
with
some
kindly
mean
word
(
a
text
of
comfort
,
which
fall
upon
a
deafen
ear
)
,
and
something
about
"
Mary
,
"
but
which
Mary
,
in
his
bewildered
state
,
he
could
not
tell
.
  
<EOS>
He
try
to
realise
it
 
to
think
it
possible
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
his
mind
wander
off
to
other
day
,
to
far
different
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
of
their
courtship
;
of
his
first
see
her
,
an
awkward
beautiful
rustic
,
far
too
shiftless
for
the
delicate
factory
work
to
which
she
be
apprentice
;
of
his
first
gift
to
her
,
a
bead
necklace
,
which
have
long
ago
be
put
by
,
in
one
of
the
deep
drawer
of
the
dresser
,
to
be
keep
for
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
He
wonder
if
it
be
there
yet
,
and
with
a
strange
curiosity
he
get
up
to
feel
for
it
;
for
the
fire
by
this
time
be
well
nigh
out
,
and
candle
he
have
none
.
 
<EOS>
His
grope
hand
fall
on
the
pile
-
up
tea
-
thing
,
which
at
his
desire
she
have
leave
unwashed
till
morning
 
they
be
all
so
tired
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
remind
of
one
of
the
daily
little
action
,
which
acquire
such
power
when
they
have
be
perform
for
the
last
time
by
one
we
love
.
 
<EOS>
He
begin
to
think
over
his
wife
's
daily
round
of
duty
:
and
something
in
the
remembrance
that
these
would
never
more
be
do
by
her
,
touch
the
source
of
tear
,
and
he
cry
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Mary
,
meanwhile
,
have
mechanically
help
the
neighbour
in
all
the
last
attention
to
the
dead
;
and
when
she
be
kiss
and
speak
to
soothingly
,
tear
steal
quietly
down
her
cheek
;
but
she
reserve
the
luxury
of
a
full
burst
of
grief
till
she
should
be
alone
.
 
<EOS>
She
shut
the
chamber
-
door
softly
,
after
the
neighbour
be
go
,
and
then
shake
the
bed
by
which
she
knelt
with
her
agony
of
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
She
repeat
,
over
and
over
again
,
<EOS>
the
same
word
;
the
same
vain
,
unanswered
address
to
her
who
be
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
mother
!
<EOS>
mother
,
be
you
really
dead
!
 
<EOS>
oh
,
mother
,
mother
!
"
  
<EOS>
at
last
she
stop
,
because
it
flash
across
her
mind
that
her
violence
of
grief
may
disturb
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
all
be
still
below
.
<EOS>
She
look
on
the
face
so
changed
,
and
yet
so
strangely
like
.
 
<EOS>
She
bend
down
to
kiss
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
cold
unyielding
flesh
strike
a
shudder
to
her
heart
,
and
hastily
obey
her
impulse
,
she
grasp
the
candle
,
and
open
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
hear
the
sobs
of
her
father
's
grief
;
and
quickly
,
quietly
steal
down
the
step
,
she
kneel
by
him
,
and
kiss
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
no
notice
at
first
;
for
his
burst
of
grief
would
not
be
control
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
her
shriller
sobs
,
her
terrified
cry
(
which
she
could
not
repress
)
,
rise
upon
his
ear
,
he
check
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
child
,
we
must
be
all
to
one
another
,
now
she
be
go
,
"
whisper
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
father
,
what
can
I
do
for
you
?
 
<EOS>
do
tell
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
do
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
thou
wilt
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
must
not
fret
thyself
ill
<EOS>
,
that
be
the
first
thing
I
ask
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
must
leave
me
and
go
to
bed
now
,
like
a
good
girl
as
thou
art
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
leave
you
,
father
!
<EOS>
oh
,
do
not
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
but
thou
must
:
thou
must
go
to
bed
,
and
try
and
sleep
;
thou'lt
have
enough
to
do
and
to
bear
,
poor
wench
,
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
Mary
get
up
,
kiss
her
father
,
and
sadly
go
upstairs
to
the
little
closet
,
where
she
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
She
think
it
be
of
no
use
undressing
,
for
that
she
could
never
,
never
sleep
<EOS>
,
so
throw
herself
on
her
bed
in
her
clothe
,
and
before
ten
minute
have
pass
away
,
the
passionate
grief
of
youth
have
subside
into
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
Barton
have
be
rouse
by
his
daughter
's
entrance
,
both
from
his
stupor
and
from
his
uncontrollable
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
think
on
what
be
to
be
do
,
could
plan
for
the
funeral
,
could
calculate
the
necessity
of
soon
return
to
his
work
,
as
the
extravagance
of
the
past
night
would
leave
them
short
of
money
if
he
long
remain
away
from
the
mill
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
in
a
club
,
so
that
money
be
provide
for
the
burial
.
 
<EOS>
these
thing
settle
in
his
own
mind
,
he
recall
the
doctor
's
word
,
and
bitterly
think
of
the
shock
his
poor
wife
have
so
recently
have
,
in
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
her
cherish
sister
.
 
<EOS>
His
feeling
towards
Esther
almost
amount
to
curse
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
she
who
have
bring
on
all
this
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
Her
giddiness
,
her
lightness
of
conduct
have
work
this
woe
.
 
<EOS>
His
previous
thought
about
her
have
be
tinge
with
wonder
and
pity
,
but
now
he
harden
his
heart
against
her
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
the
good
influence
over
John
Barton
's
life
have
depart
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
the
tie
which
bind
him
down
to
the
gentle
humanity
of
earth
be
loosen
,
and
henceforward
the
neighbour
all
remark
he
be
a
changed
man
.
 
<EOS>
His
gloom
and
his
sternness
become
habitual
instead
of
occasional
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
more
obstinate
.
 
<EOS>
but
never
to
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
between
the
father
and
the
daughter
there
exist
in
full
force
that
mysterious
bond
which
unite
those
who
have
be
love
by
one
who
be
now
dead
and
go
.
 
<EOS>
while
he
be
harsh
and
silent
to
other
,
he
humour
Mary
with
tender
love
:
she
have
more
of
her
own
way
than
be
common
in
any
rank
with
girl
of
her
age
.
<EOS>
part
of
this
be
the
necessity
of
the
case
;
for
of
course
all
the
money
go
through
her
hand
,
and
the
household
arrangement
be
guide
by
her
will
and
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
but
part
be
her
father
's
indulgence
,
for
he
leave
her
,
with
full
trust
in
her
unusual
sense
and
spirit
,
to
choose
her
own
associate
,
and
her
own
time
for
see
them
.
  
<EOS>
with
all
this
,
Mary
have
not
her
father
's
confidence
in
the
matter
which
now
begin
to
occupy
him
,
heart
and
soul
;
she
be
aware
that
he
have
join
club
,
and
become
an
active
member
of
the
Trades
'
Union
,
but
it
be
hardly
likely
that
a
girl
of
Mary
's
age
(
even
when
two
or
three
year
have
elapse
since
her
mother
's
death
)
should
care
much
for
the
difference
between
the
employer
and
the
employ
 
an
eternal
subject
for
agitation
in
the
manufacturing
district
,
which
,
however
it
may
be
lull
for
a
time
,
be
sure
to
break
forth
again
with
fresh
violence
at
any
depression
of
trade
,
show
that
in
its
apparent
quiet
,
the
ashe
have
still
smoulder
in
the
breast
of
a
few
.
  
<EOS>
among
these
few
be
John
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
at
all
time
it
be
a
bewilder
thing
to
the
poor
weaver
to
see
his
employer
remove
from
house
to
house
,
<EOS>
each
one
grander
than
the
last
,
till
he
end
in
build
one
more
magnificent
than
all
,
or
withdraw
his
money
from
the
concern
,
or
sell
his
mill
,
to
buy
an
estate
in
the
country
,
while
all
the
time
the
weaver
,
who
think
he
and
his
fellow
be
the
real
maker
of
this
wealth
,
be
struggle
on
for
bread
for
his
child
,
through
the
vicissitude
of
lower
wage
,
short
hour
,
few
hand
employ
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
he
know
trade
be
bad
,
and
could
understand
(
at
least
partially
)
that
there
be
not
buyer
enough
in
the
market
to
purchase
the
good
already
make
,
and
consequently
that
there
be
no
demand
for
more
;
when
he
would
bear
and
endure
much
without
complain
<EOS>
,
could
he
also
see
that
his
employer
be
bear
their
share
;
he
be
,
I
say
,
bewilder
and
(
to
use
his
own
word
)
"
aggravate
"
to
see
that
all
go
on
just
as
usual
with
the
millowner
.
 
<EOS>
large
house
be
still
occupy
,
while
spinner
'
and
weaver
'
cottage
stand
empty
,
because
the
family
that
once
fill
them
be
oblige
to
live
in
room
or
cellar
.
 
<EOS>
Carriages
still
roll
along
the

the

while
the

loiter
away
his

time
in
watch
these

at

ask

for

of
the

,
of
the
die
life
of
those
near
and
dear
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
contrast
be
too
great
.
 
<EOS>
why
should
he
alone
suffer
from
bad
time
?
  
<EOS>
I
know
that
this
be
not
really
the
case
;
and
I
know
what
be
the
truth
in
such
matter
;
but
what
I
wish
to
impress
be
what
the
workman
feel
and
think
.
 
<EOS>
true
,
that
with
child
-
like
improvidence
,
good
time
will
often
dissipate
his
grumbling
,
and
make
him
forget
all
prudence
and
foresight
.
  
<EOS>
but
there
be
earnest
man
among
these
people
,
man
who
have
endure
wrong
without
complain
,
but
without
ever
forget
or
forgive
those
whom
(
they
believe
)
have
cause
all
this
woe
.
  
<EOS>
among
these
be
John
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
His
parent
have
suffer
;
his
mother
have
die
from
absolute
want
of
the
necessary
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
himself
be
a
good
,
steady
workman
,
and
,
as
such
,
pretty
certain
of
steady
employment
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
spend
all
he
get
with
the
confidence
<EOS>
(
you
may
also
call
it
improvidence
)
of
one
who
be
willing
,
and
believe
himself
able
,
to
supply
all
his
want
by
his
own
exertion
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
his
master
suddenly
fail
,
and
all
hand
in
the
mill
be
turn
back
,
one
Tuesday
morning
,
with
the
news
that
Mr.
Hunter
have
stop
,
Barton
have
only
a
few
shilling
to
rely
on
;
but
he
have
good
heart
of
be
employ
at
some
other
mill
,
and
accordingly
,
before
return
home
,
he
spend
some
hour
in
go
from
factory
to
factory
,
ask
for
work
.
 
<EOS>
but
at
every
mill
be
some
sign
of
depression
of
trade
!
<EOS>
some
be
work
short
hour
,
some
be
turn
off
hand
,
and
for
week
Barton
be
out
of
work
,
live
on
credit
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
during
this
time
that
his
little
son
,
the
apple
of
his
eye
,
the
cynosure
of
all
his
strong
power
of
love
,
fall
ill
of
the
scarlet
fever
.
 
<EOS>
They
drag
him
through
the
crisis
,
but
his
life
hang
on
a
gossamer
thread
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
,
the
doctor
say
,
depend
on
good
nourishment
,
on
generous
living
,
to
keep
up
the
little
fellow
's
strength
,
in
the
prostration
in
which
the
fever
have
leave
him
.
 
<EOS>
mock
word
!
<EOS>
when
the
common
food
in
the
house
would
not
furnish
one
little
meal
.
 
<EOS>
Barton
try
credit
;
but
it
be
wear
out
at
the
little
provision
shop
,
which
be
now
suffer
in
their
turn
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
it
would
be
no
sin
to
steal
,
and
would
have
steal
;
but
he
could
not
get
the
opportunity
in
the
few
day
the
child
linger
.
 
<EOS>
Hungry
himself
,
almost
to
an
animal
pitch
of
ravenousness
,
but
with
the
bodily
pain
swallow
up
in
anxiety
for
his
little
sinking
lad
<EOS>
,
he
stand
at
one
of
the
shop
window
where
all
edible
luxury
be
display
;
haunch
of
venison
,
Stilton
cheese
,
mould
of
jelly
 
all
appetise
sight
to
the
common
passer
-
by
.
 
<EOS>
and
out
of
this
shop
come
Mrs.
Hunter
!
 
<EOS>
She
cross
to
her
carriage
,
follow
by
the
shopman
load
with
purchase
for
a
party
.
 
<EOS>
the
door
be
quickly
slam
to
,
and
she
drive
away
;
and
Barton
return
home
with
a
bitter
spirit
of
wrath
in
his
heart
to
see
his
only
boy
a
corpse
!
  
<EOS>
You
can
fancy
,
now
,
the
hoard
of
vengeance
in
his
heart
against
the
employer
.
 
<EOS>
for
there
be
never
want
those
who
,
either
in
speech
or
in
print
,
find
it
their
interest
to
cherish
such
feeling
in
the
work
class
;
who
know
how
and
when
to
rouse
the
dangerous
power
at
their
command
;
and
who
use
their
knowledge
with
unrelenting
purpose
to
either
party
.
  
<EOS>
so
while
Mary
take
her
own
way
,
grow
more
spirited
every
day
,
and
grow
in
her
beauty
too
,
her
father
be
chairman
at
many
a
Trades
'
Union
meeting
;
a
friend
of
delegate
,
and
ambitious
of
be
a
delegate
himself
;
a
Chartist
,
and
ready
to
do
anything
for
his
order
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
time
be
good
;
and
all
these
feeling
be
theoretical
,
not
practical
.
 
<EOS>
His
most
practical
thought
be
get
Mary
apprentice
to
a
dressmaker
;
for
he
have
never
leave
off
dislike
a
factory
life
for
a
girl
,
on
more
account
than
one
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
must
do
something
.
 
<EOS>
the
factory
be
,
as
I
say
,
out
of
the
question
,
there
be
two
thing
open
 
go
out
to
service
and
the
dressmaking
business
;
and
against
the
first
of
these
,
Mary
set
herself
with
all
the
force
of
her
strong
will
.
 
<EOS>
what
that
will
may
have
be
able
to
achieve
have
her
father
be
against
her
,
I
can
not
tell
;
but
he
dislike
the
idea
of
part
with
her
,
who
be
the
light
of
his
hearth
;
the
voice
of
his
otherwise
silent
home
.
<EOS>
besides
,
with
his
idea
and
feeling
towards
the
high
class
,
he
consider
domestic
servitude
as
a
species
of
slavery
;
a
pampering
of
artificial
want
on
the
one
side
,
a
giving
up
of
every
right
of
leisure
by
day
and
quiet
rest
by
night
on
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
how
far
his
strong
exaggerated
feeling
have
any
foundation
in
truth
,
it
be
for
you
to
judge
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
that
Mary
's
determination
not
to
go
to
service
arise
from
far
less
sensible
thought
on
the
subject
than
her
father
's
.
 
<EOS>
three
year
of
independence
of
action
(
since
her
mother
's
death
such
a
time
have
now
elapse
)
have
little
incline
her
to
submit
to
rule
as
to
hour
and
associate
,
to
regulate
her
dress
by
a
mistress
's
idea
of
propriety
,
to
lose
the
dear
feminine
privilege
of
gossip
with
a
merry
neighbour
,
and
work
night
and
day
to
help
one
who
be
sorrowful
.
 
<EOS>
besides
all
this
,
the
saying
of
her
absent
,
the
mysterious
aunt
Esther
,
have
an
unacknowledged
influence
over
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
She
know
she
be
very
pretty
;
the
factory
people
as
they
pour
from
the
mill
,
and
in
their
freedom
tell
the
truth
(
whatever
it
may
be
)
to
every
passer
-
by
,
have
early
let
Mary
into
the
secret
of
her
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
if
their
remark
have
fall
on
an
unheeding
ear
,
there
be
always
young
man
enough
,
in
a
different
rank
from
her
own
,
who
be
willing
to
compliment
the
pretty
weaver
's
daughter
as
they
meet
her
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
trust
a
girl
of
sixteen
for
know
it
well
if
she
be
pretty
;
concern
her
plainness
<EOS>
she
may
be
ignorant
.
 
<EOS>
so
with
this
consciousness
she
have
early
determine
that
her
beauty
should
make
her
a
lady
;
the
rank
she
covet
the
more
for
her
father
's
abuse
;
the
rank
to
which
she
firmly
believe
her
lose
aunt
<EOS>
Esther
have
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
while
a
servant
must
often
drudge
and
be
dirty
,
must
be
know
as
his
servant
by
all
who
visit
at
her
master
's
house
,
a
dressmaker
's
apprentice
must
(
or
so
Mary
think
)
<EOS>
be
always
dressed
with
a
certain
regard
to
appearance
;
must
never
soil
her
hand
,
and
nee
never
redden
or
dirty
her
face
with
hard
labour
.
 
<EOS>
before
my
tell
you
so
truly
what
folly
Mary
feel
or
think
,
injure
her
without
redemption
in
your
opinion
,
think
what
be
the
silly
fancy
of
sixteen
year
of
age
in
every
class
,
and
under
all
circumstance
.
<EOS>
the
end
of
all
the
thought
of
father
and
daughter
be
,
as
I
say
before
,
Mary
be
to
be
a
dressmaker
;
and
her
ambition
prompt
her
unwilling
father
to
apply
at
all
the
first
establishment
,
to
know
on
what
term
of
painstaking
and
zeal
his
daughter
may
be
admit
into
ever
so
humble
a
workwoman
's
situation
.
 
<EOS>
but
high
premium
be
ask
at
all
;
poor
man
!
<EOS>
he
may
have
know
that
without
give
up
a
day
's
work
to
ascertain
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
be
indignant
,
indeed
<EOS>
,
have
he
know
that
if
Mary
have
accompany
him
,
the
case
may
have
be
rather
different
,
as
her
beauty
would
have
make
her
desirable
as
a
show
-
woman
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
try
second
-
rate
place
;
at
all
the
payment
of
a
sum
of
money
be
necessary
,
and
money
he
have
none
.
<EOS>
disheartened
and
angry
,
he
go
home
at
night
,
declare
it
be
time
lose
;
that
dressmaking
be
at
all
event
a
troublesome
business
,
and
not
worth
learn
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
see
that
the
grape
be
sour
,
and
the
next
day
she
set
out
herself
,
as
her
father
could
not
afford
to
lose
another
day
's
work
;
and
before
night
(
as
yesterday
's
experience
have
considerably
lower
her
idea
)
<EOS>
she
have
engage
herself
as
apprentice
(
so
call
,
though
there
be
no
deed
or
indenture
to
the
bond
)
to
a
certain
Miss
Simmonds
,
milliner
and
dressmaker
,
in
a
respectable
little
street
lead
off
Ardwick
Green
,
where
her

ground

and
stick
in
the
front
-
parlour
window
;
where
the
workwoman
be
call
"
her
young
lady
"
;
and
where
Mary
be
to
work
for
two
year
without
any
remuneration
,
on
consideration
of
be
teach
the
business
;
and
where
afterwards
she
be
to
dine
and
have
tea
,
with
a
small
quarterly
salary
(
pay
quarterly
because
so
much
more
genteel
than
by
the
week
)
,
a
very
small
one
,
divisible
into
a
minute
weekly
pittance
.
 
<EOS>
in
summer
she
be
to
be
there
by
six
,
bring
her
day
's
meal
during
the
first
two
year
;
in
winter
she
be
not
to
come
till
after
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
Her
time
for
return
home
at
night
must
always
depend
upon
the
quantity
of
work
<EOS>
Miss
Simmonds
have
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
and
Mary
be
satisfied
;
and
see
this
,
her
father
be
content
too
,
although
his
word
be
grumble
and
morose
;
but
Mary
know
his
way
,
and
coaxed
and
plan
for

so
cheerily

another

pass

<EOS>
the
wave
of
time
seem
long
since
to
have
sweep
away
all
trace
of
poor
Mary
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
but
her
husband
still
think
of
her
,
although
with
a
calm
and
quiet
grief
,
in
the
silent
watch
of
the
night
:
and
Mary
would
start
from
her
hard

earn
sleep
,
and
think
,
in
her
half
-
dreamy
,
half
-
awaken
state

she
see
her
mother
stand
by
her
bedside

she
use
to
do
"
in
the
day
of
long
ago
"

with
a
shaded
candle
and
an
expression
of
ineffable
tenderness
,
while
she
look
on
her
sleep
child

but
Mary
rub
her
eye
and
sink
back
on
her
pillow
,
awake
,
and
know
it
be
a
dream
;
and
still
,
in
all
her
trouble
and
perplexity
,
her
heart
call
on
her
mother
for
aid
,
and
she
think
,
"
if
mother
have
but
live
,
she
would
have
help
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
forget
that
the
woman
's
sorrow
be
far
more
difficult
to
mitigate
than
a
child
's
,
even
by
the
mighty
power
of
a
mother
's
love
;
and
unconscious
of
the
fact

that
she
be
far
superior
in
sense
and
spirit
to
the
mother
she
mourn
.
 
<EOS>
Aunt
Esther
be
still
mysteriously
absent
,
and
people
have
grow
weary
of
wondering
,
and
begin
to
forget
.
 
<EOS>
Barton
still
attend
his
club
,
and
be
an
active
member
of
a
Trades
'
union
;
indeed
,
more
frequently
than
ever
,
since
the
time
of
Mary

return
in
the

be
so
uncertain
;
and
as
she
occasionally
,
in
very
busy
time
,
remain
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
His
chief
friend
be
still
George
Wilson
,
although
he
have
no
great
sympathy
on
the
question
that
agitate
Barton
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
but
their
heart
be
bind
by
old
tie
to
one
another
,
and
the
remembrance
of
former
thing
give
an
unspoken
charm
to
their
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
Our

His

be
never

of
praise
Jem
,
at
all
which
commendation
<EOS>
pretty
Mary
Barton
would
toss
her
head

see
clearly
enough
that
they
wish
her
to
understand
what
a
good

would
make
,
and
to
favour

about
which
he
never

<EOS>
one
day
,
in
the
early
winter
time
,
when
people
be
provide
with
warm

,
not

soon
to

and
when

at

,
Mary
meet

come

the

whose
forgiving
kiss
have
comfort
her

so
there
be
a
warm
greeting
between
the
tidy
old
woman
and
the
bloom

and
then
Alice
venture
to
ask
if
she
would
come
in
and
take
her
tea
with
her
that
very
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
think
it
dull
enough
to
come
just
to
sit
with
an
old
woman
like
me
,
but
there
be
a
tidy
young
lass
as
life
in
the
floor
above
,
who
do
plain
work
,
and
now
and
then
a
bit
in
your
own
line
,
Mary
;
she
be
grand
-
daughter
to
old
Job
Legh
,
a
spinner
,
and
a
good
girl
she
be
.
 
<EOS>
do
come
,
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
terrible
wish
to
make
you
known
to
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
genteel
-
look
lass
,
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
the
beginning
of
this
speech
Mary
have
fear
the
intended
visitor
be
to
be
no
other
than
Alice
's
nephew
;
but
Alice
be
too
delicate
-
minded
to
plan
a
meeting
,
even
for
her
dear
Jem
,
when
one
would
have
be
an
unwilling
party
;
and
Mary
,
relieve
from
her
apprehension
by
the
conclusion
,
gladly
agree
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
how
busy
Alice
feel
!
<EOS>
it
be
not
often
she
have
any
one
to
tea
;
and
now
her
sense
of
the
duty
of
a
hostess
be
almost
too
much
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
make
haste
home
,
and
light
the
unwilling
fire
,
borrow
a
pair
of
bellow
to
make
it
burn
the
faster
.
 
<EOS>
for
herself
she
be
always
patient
;
she
let
the
coal
take
their
time
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
put
on
her
patten
,
and
go
to
fill
her
kettle
at
the
pump
in
the
next
court
,
and
on
her
way
she
borrow
a
cup
;
of
odd
saucer
she
have
plenty
,
serve
as
plate
when
occasion
require
.
 
<EOS>
half
an
ounce
of
tea
and
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
butter
go
far
to
absorb
her
morning
's
wage
;
but
this
be
an
unusual
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
in
general
,
she
use
herb
-
tea
for
herself
,
when
at
home
,
unless
some
thoughtful
mistress
make
a
present
of
tea
-
leave
from
her
more
abundant
household
.
 
<EOS>
the
two
chair
draw
out
for
visitor
,
and
duly
sweep
and
dust
;
an
old
board
arrange
with
some
skill
upon
two
old
candle
box
set
on
end
(
rather
rickety
to
be
sure
,
but
she
know
the
seat
of
old
,
and
when
to
sit
lightly
;
indeed
the
whole
affair
be
more
for
apparent
dignity
of
position
than
for
any
real
ease
)
;
a
little
,
very
little
round
table
,
put
just
before
the
fire
,
which
by
this
time
be
blaze
merrily
;
her
unlacquered
ancient
,
third
-
hand
tea
-
tray
arrange
with
a
black
tea
-
pot
,
two
cup
with
a
red
and
white
pattern
,
and
one
with
the
old
friendly
willow
pattern
,
and
saucer
,
not
to
match
(
on
one
of
the
extra
supply
the
lump
of
butter
flourish
away
)
;
all
these
preparation
complete
,
Alice
begin
to
look
about
her
with
satisfaction
,
and
a
sort
of
wonder
what
more
could
be
do
to
add
to
the
comfort
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
one
of
the
chair
away
from
its
appropriate
place
by
the
table
,
and
put
it
close
to
the
broad
large
hanging
shelf
I
tell
you
about
when
I
first
describe
her
cellar
-
dwelling
,
and
mount
on
it
,
she
pull
towards
her
an
old
deal
box
,
and
take
thence
a
quantity
of
the
oat
bread
of
the
north
,
the
"
clap
-
bread
"
of
Cumberland
and
Westmoreland
,
and
descend
carefully
with
the
thin
cake
,
threaten
to
break
to
piece
in
her
hand
,
she
place
them
on
the
bare
table
,
with
the
belief
that
her
visitor
would
have
an
unusual
treat
in
eat
the
bread
of
her
childhood
.
 
<EOS>
She
bring
out
a
good
piece
of
a
four
-
pound
loaf
of
common
household
bread
as
well
,
and
then
sit
down
to
rest
,
really
to
rest
,
and
not
to
pretend
,
on
one
of
the
rush
-
bottom
chair
.
 
<EOS>
the
candle
be
ready
to
be
light
,
the
kettle
boil
,
the
tea
be
await
its
doom
in
its
paper
parcel
;
all
be
ready
.
  
<EOS>
a
knock
at
the
door
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
Margaret
,
the
young
workwoman
who
live
in
the
room
above
,
who
have
hear
the
bustle
,
and
the
subsequent
quiet
,
begin
to
think
it
be
time
to
pay
her
visit
below
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
sallow
,
unhealthy
,
sweet
-
looking
young
woman
,
with
a
careworn
look
;
her
dress
be
humble
and
very
simple
,
consist
of
some
kind
of
dark
stuff
gown
,
her
neck
be
cover
by
a
drab
shawl
or
large
handkerchief
,
pin
down
behind
and
at
the
side
in
front
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
woman
give
her
a
hearty
greeting
,
and
make
her
sit
down
on
the
chair
she
have
just
leave
,
while
she
balance
herself
on
the
board
seat
,
in
order
that
Margaret
may
think
it
be
quite
her
free
and
independent
choice
to
sit
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
think
what
keep
Mary
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
quite
grand
with
her
late
hour
,
"
say
Alice
,
as
Mary
still
delay
.
  
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
Mary
be
dress
herself
;
yes
,
to
come
to
poor
old
Alice
's
 
<EOS>
she
think
it
worth
while
to
consider
what
gown
she
should
put
on
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
for
Alice
,
however
,
you
may
be
pretty
sure
;
no
,
they
know
each
other
too
well
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mary
like
make
an
impression
,
and
in
this
it
must
be
own
she
be
pretty
often
gratified
 
and
there
be
this
strange
girl
to
consider
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
put
on
her
pretty
new
blue
merino
,
make
tight
to
her
throat
her
little
linen
collar
and
linen
cuff
,
and
sally
forth
to
impress
poor
gentle
Margaret
.
 
<EOS>
She
certainly
succeed
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
,
who
never
think
much
about
beauty
,
have
never
tell
Margaret
how
pretty
Mary
be
;
and
,
as
she
come
in
half
-
blushing
at
her
own
self
-
consciousness
,
Margaret
could
hardly
take
her
eye
off
her
,
and
Mary
put
down
her
long
black
lash
with
a
sort
of
dislike
of
the
very
observation
she
have
take
such
pain
to
secure
.
 
<EOS>
Can
you
fancy
the
bustle
of
Alice
to
make
the
tea
,
to
pour
it
out
,
and
sweeten
it
to
their
liking
,
to
help
and
help
again
to
clap
-
bread
and
bread
and
butter
?
 
<EOS>
Can
you
fancy
the
delight
with
which
she
watch
her
pile
-
up
clap
-
bread
disappear
before
the
hungry
girl
and
listen
to
the
praise
of
her
home
-
remember
dainty
?
  
<EOS>
"
My
mother
use
to
send
me
some
clap
-
bread
by
any
north
-
country
person
 
bless
her
!
<EOS>
She
know
how
good
such
thing
taste
when
far
away
from
home
.
 
<EOS>
not
but
what
every
one
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
be
in
service
my
fellow
-
servant
be
always
glad
to
share
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
eh
,
it
be
a
long
time
ago
,
yon
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
tell
us
about
it
,
Alice
,
"
say
Margaret
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
lass
,
there
be
nothing
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
more
mouth
at
home
than
could
be
feed
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
,
that
be
Will
's
father
<EOS>
(
you
do
not
know
Will
,
but
he
be
a
sailor
to
foreign
part
)
,
have
come
to
Manchester
,
and
send
word
what
terrible
lot
of
work
be
to
be
have
,
both
for
lad
and
lass
.
 
<EOS>
so
father
send
George
first
(
you
know
George
,
well
enough
,
Mary
)
,
and
then
work
be
scarce
out
toward
Burton
,
where
we
live
,
and
father
say
I
maun
try
and
get
a
place
.
 
<EOS>
and
George
write
as
how
wage
be
far
high
in
Manchester
than
Milnthorpe
or
Lancaster
;
<EOS>
and
,
lass
,
I
be
young
and
thoughtless
,
and
think
it
be
a
fine
thing
to
go
so
far
from
home
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
one
day
,
th
'
butcher
he
bring
us
a
letter
fra
George
,
to
say
he
would
hear
on
a
place
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
all
agog
to
go
,
and
father
be
pleased
like
<EOS>
;
but
mother
say
little
,
and
that
little
be
very
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
think
she
be
a
bit
hurt
to
see
me
so
ready
to
go
 
<EOS>
God
forgive
me
!
 
<EOS>
but
she
pack
up
my
clothe
,
and
some
of
the
well
end
of
her
own
as
would
fit
me
,
in
yon
little
paper
box
up
there
 
<EOS>
it
be
good
for
nought
now
,
but
I
would
liefer
live
without
fire
than
break
it
up
to
be
burn
;
and
yet
it
be
go
on
for
eighty
year
old
,
<EOS>
for
she
have
it
when
she
be
a
girl
,
and
bring
all
her
clothe
in
it
to
father
's
when
they
be
marry
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
be
say
,
she
do
not
cry
,
though
the
tear
be
often
in
her
eye
;
and
I
see
her
look
after
me
down
the
lane
as
long
as
I
be
in
sight
,
with
her
hand
shade
her
eye
 
<EOS>
and
that
be
the
last
look
I
ever
have
on
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Alice
know
that
before
long
she
should
go
to
that
mother
;
and
,
besides
,
the
griefs
and
bitter
woe
of
youth
have
wear
themselves
out
before
we
grow
old
;
but
she
look
so
sorrowful
that
the
girl
catch
her
sadness
,
and
mourn
for
the
poor
woman
who
have
be
dead
and
go
so
many
year
ago
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
never
see
her
again
,
Alice
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
never
go
home
while
she
be
alive
?
"
ask
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
nor
since
.
 
<EOS>
many
a
time
and
oft
<EOS>
have
I
plan
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
plan
it
yet
,
and
hope
to
go
home
again
before
it
please
God
to
take
me
.
<EOS>
I
use
to
try
and
save
money
enough
to
go
for
a
week
when
I
be
in
service
;
but
first
one
thing
come
,
and
then
another
.
 
<EOS>
first
,
missis
's
child
fall
ill
of
the
measle
,
just
when
the
week
I
would
ask
for
come
,
and
I
could
not
leave
them
,
for
one
and
all
cry
for
me
to
nurse
them
.
 
<EOS>
then
missis
herself
fall
sick
,
and
I
could
go
less
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
you
see
,
they
keep
a
little
shop
,
and
he
drink
,
and
missis
and
me
be
all
there
be
to
mind
child
and
shop
and
all
,
and
cook
and
wash
besides
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
be
glad
she
have
not
go
into
service
,
and
say
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
eh
,
lass
!
<EOS>
thou
little
know
the
pleasure
o
'
help
other
;
I
be
as
happy
there
as
could
be
;
almost
as
happy
as
I
be
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
but
next
year
I
think
I
could
go
at
a
leisure
time
,
and
missis
tell
me
<EOS>
I
should
have
a
fortnight
then
,
and
I
use
to
sit
up
all
that
winter
work
hard
at
patchwork
,
to
have
a
quilt
of
my
own
making
to
take
to
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
but
master
die
,
and
missis
go
away
fra
Manchester
,
and
I
would
to
look
out
for
a
place
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
,
"
interrupt
Mary
,
"
I
should
have
think
that
be
the
good
time
to
go
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
think
not
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
it
be
a
different
thing
go
home
for
a
week
on
a
visit
,
may
be
with
money
in
my
pocket
to
give
father
a
lift
,
to
go
home
to
be
a
burden
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
how
could
I
hear
o
'
a
place
there
?
 
<EOS>
anyways
I
think
it
best
to
stay
,
though
perhaps
it
may
have
be
well
to
ha
'
go
,
for
then
I
should
ha
'
see
mother
again
"
;
and
the
poor
old
woman
look
puzzled
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
you
do
what
you
think
right

say
Margaret
gently

<EOS>
"
ay

say
Alice
,
raise
her
head
and
speak
more
cheerfully

<EOS>
"
that
be
the
thing
,
and
then
let
the
Lord
send
what
He
see
fit
;
not
but
that
I
grieve
sore
,
oh
,
sore
and
sad
,
when
towards
spring
next
year
,
when
my

be
all
do
to
th

George
come
in
one
evening
to
tell
me
mother
be
dead

<EOS>
I
cry
many
a
night
at
after
;
<EOS>

<EOS>
I
would
no
time
for
crying
by
day
,
for
that
missis
be
terrible
strict
;
she
would
not
hearken
to
my
go
to
th

funeral
;
and
indeed
I
would
have
be
too
late

set
off
that
very
night
by

and
Phryganidae
have
be
so
much
and
so
closely
study
by
Manchester
workman
,
while
they
have
in
a
great
measure
escape
general
observation
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
will
refer
to
the
preface
to
Sir
J.
E.
Smith
's
Life
(
I
have
it
not
by
me
,
or
I
would
copy
you
the
exact
passage
)
,
you
will
find
that
he
name
a
little
circumstance
corroborative
of
what
I
have
say
.
 
<EOS>
be
on
a
visit
to
Roscoe
,
of
Liverpool
,
he
make
some
inquiry
of
him
as
to
the
habitat
of
a
very
rare
plant
,
say
to
be
find
in
certain
place
in
Lancashire
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Roscoe
know
nothing
of
the
plant
;
but
state
,
that
if
any
one
could
give
him
the
desire
information
,
it
would
be
a
hand
-
loom
weaver
in
Manchester
,
whom
he
name
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
J.
E.
Smith
proceed
by
boat
to
Manchester
,
and
on
arrive
at
that
town
,
he
inquire
of
the
porter
who
be
carry
his
luggage
if
he
could
direct
him
to
so
-
and
-
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
yes
,
"
reply
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
do
a
bit
in
my
way
"
;
and
,
on
further
investigation
,
it
turn
out
that
both
the
porter
and
his
friend
the
weaver
be
skilful
botanist
,
and
able
to
give
Sir
J.
E.
Smith
the
very
information
which
he
want
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
taste
and
pursuit
of
some
of
the
thoughtful
,
little
understood
,
work
-
man
of
Manchester
.
  
<EOS>
and
Margaret
's
grandfather
be
one
of
these
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
little
wiry
-
look
old
man
,
who
move
with
a
jerk
motion
,
as
if
his
limb
be
work
by
a
string
like
a
child
's
toy
,
with
dun
-
colour
hair
lie
thin
and
soft
at
the
back
and
side
of
his
head
;
his
forehead
be
so
large
it
seem
to
overbalance
the
rest
of
his
face
,
<EOS>
which
have
,
indeed
,
lose
its
natural
contour
by
the
absence
of
all
the
tooth
.
 
<EOS>
the
eye
absolutely
gleam
with
intelligence
;
so
keen
,
so
observant
,
you
feel
as
if
they
be
almost
wizard
-
like
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
whole
room
look
not
unlike
a
wizard
's
dwelling
.
 
<EOS>
instead
of
picture
be
hang
rude
wooden
frame
of
impale
insect
;
the
little
table
be
cover
with
cabalistic
book
;
and
beside
them
lie
a
case
of
mysterious
instrument
,
one
of
which
Job
Legh
be
use
when
his
grand
-
daughter
enter
.
  
<EOS>
on
her
appearance
he
push
his
spectacle
up
so
as
to
rest
midway
on
his
forehead
,
and
give
Mary
a
short
,
kind
welcome
.
 
<EOS>
but
Margaret
he
caress
as
a
mother
<EOS>
caress
her
first
-
bear
;
stroke
her
with
tenderness
,
and
almost
alter
his
voice
as
he
speak
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
look
round
on
the
odd
,
strange
thing
she
have
never
see
at
home
,
and
which
seem
to
her
to
have
a
very
uncanny
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
your
grandfather
a
fortune
-
teller
?
"
<EOS>
whisper
she
to
her
new
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
reply
Margaret
,
in
the
same
voice
;
"
but
you
be
not
the
first
as
have
take
him
for
such
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
only
fond
of
such
thing
as
most
folk
know
nothing
about
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
you
know
aught
about
them
too
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
a
bit
about
some
of
the
thing
grandfather
be
fond
on
;
just
because
he
be
fond
on
'em
,
I
try
to
learn
about
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
thing
be
these
?
"
say
Mary
,
strike
with
the
weird
-
look
creature
that
sprawl
around
the
room
in
their
roughly
-
make
glass
case
.
  
<EOS>
but
she
be
not
prepare
for
the
technical
name
,
which
Job
Legh
patter
down
on
her
ear
,
on
which
they
fall
like
hail
on
a
skylight
;
and
<EOS>
the
strange
language
only
bewilder
her
more
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
Margaret
see
the
state
of
the
case
,
and
come
to
the
rescue
.
  
<EOS>
"
look
,
Mary
,
at
this
horrid
scorpion
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
me
such
a
fright
<EOS>
:
I
be
all
of
a
twitter
yet
when
I
think
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Grandfather
go
to
Liverpool
one
Whitsun
-
week
to
go
stroll
about
the
dock
and
pick
up
what
he
could
from
the
sailor
,
who
often
bring
some
queer
thing
or
another
from
the
hot
country
they
go
to
;
and
so
he
see
a
chap
with
a
bottle
in
his
hand
,
like
a
druggist
's
physic
-
bottle
;
and
say
grandfather
,
"
what
have
ye
get
there
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
the
sailor
hold
it
up
,
and
grandfather
know
it
be
a
rare
kind
<EOS>
o
'
scorpion
,
not
common
even
in
the
East
Indies
where
the
man
come
from
;
and
say
he
,
"
how
do
you
catch
this
fine
fellow
,
for
he
would
not
be
take
for
nothing
,
I
be
think
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
the
man
say
as
how
when
they
be
unload
the
ship
he
would
find
him
lie
behind
a
bag
of
rice
,
and
he
think
the
cold
have
kill
him
,
for
he
be
not
squash
nor
injure
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
like
to
part
with
any
of
the
spirit
out
of
his
grog
to
put
the
scorpion
in
,
but
slip
him
into
the
bottle
,
know
there
be
folk
enow
who
would
give
him
something
for
him
.
<EOS>
so
grandfather
give
him
a
shilling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
two
shilling
,
"
interrupt
Job
Legh
;
"
and
a
good
bargain
it
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
!
grandfather
come
home
as
proud
as
Punch
,
and
pull
the
bottle
out
of
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
see
th
'
scorpion
be
double
up
,
and
grandfather
think
I
could
not
fairly
see
how
big
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
shake
him
out
right
before
the
fire
;
and
a
good
warm
one
it
be
,
for
I
be
iron
<EOS>
,
I
remember
.
 
<EOS>
I
leave
off
iron
and
stoop
down
over
him
,
to
look
at
him
better
,
and
grandfather
get
a
book
,
and
begin
to
read
how
this
very
kind
be
the
most
poisonous
and
vicious
specie
,
how
their
bite
be
often
fatal
,
and
then
go
on
to
read
how
people
who
be
bite
get
swell
,
and
scream
with
pain
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
listen
hard
,
but
as
it
fall
out
,
I
never
take
my
eye
off
the
creature
,
though
I
could
not
ha
'
tell
I
be
watch
it
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
it
seem
to
give
a
jerk
,
and
before
I
could
speak
it
give
another
,
and
in
a
minute
it
be
as
wild
as
it
could
be
,
run
at
me
just
like
a
mad
dog
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
do
?
"
ask
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Me
!
<EOS>
why
,
I
jump
first
on
a
chair
,
and
then
on
all
the
thing
I
would
be
iron
on
the
dresser
,
and
I
scream
for
grandfather
to
come
up
by
me
,
but
he
do
not
hearken
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
if
I
would
come
up
by
thee
,
who
have
ha
'
catch
the
creature
,
I
should
like
to
know
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
beg
grandfather
to
crush
it
,
and
I
have
the
iron
right
over
it
once
,
ready
to
drop
,
but
grandfather
beg
me
not
to
hurt
it
in
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
could
not
think
what
he
would
have
<EOS>
,
for
he
hop
round
the
room
as
if
he
be
sore
afraid
,
for
all
he
beg
me
not
to
injure
it
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
he
go
to
th
'
kettle
,
and
lift
up
the
lid
,
and
peep
in
.
 
<EOS>
what
on
earth
be
he
do
that
for
,
think
I
;
he
will
never
drink
his
tea
with
a
scorpion
run
free
and
easy
about
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
take
the
tong
,
and
he
settle
his
spectacle
on
his
nose
,
and
in
a
minute
he
have
lift
the
creature
up
by
th
'
leg
,
and
drop
him
into
the
boiling
water
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
that
kill
him
?
"
say
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
sure
enough
;
he
boil
for
long
time
than
grandfather
like
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
so
afeard
of
his
come
round
again
<EOS>
,
I
run
to
the
public
-
house
for
some
gin
,
and
grandfather
fill
the
bottle
,
and
then
we
pour
off
the
water
,
and
pick
him
out
of
the
kettle
,
and
drop
him
into
the
bottle
,
and
he
be
there
about
a
twelvemonth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
bring
him
to
life
at
first
?
"
ask
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
see
,
he
be
never
really
dead
,
only
torpid
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
dead
asleep
with
the
cold
,
and
<EOS>
our
good
fire
bring
him
round
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
father
do
not
care
for
such
thing
,
"
say
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
?
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
be
often
<EOS>
downright
glad
grandfather
be
so
fond
of
his
book
,
and
his
creature
,
and
his
plant
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
my
heart
good
to
see
him
so
happy
,
sort
them
all
at
home
,
and
so
ready
to
go
in
search
of
more
,
whenever
he
be
a
spare
day
.
 
<EOS>
look
at
him
now
!
<EOS>
he
be
go
back
to
his
book
,
and
he
will
be
as
happy
as
a
king
,
work
away
<EOS>
till
I
make
him
go
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
It
keep
him
silent
,
to
be
sure
;
but
so
long
as
I
see
him
earnest
,
and
please
,
and
eager
,
what
do
that
matter
?
 
<EOS>
then
,
when
he
have
his
talk
bout
,
you
can
not
think
how
much
he
have
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
dear
grandfather
!
<EOS>
you
do
not
know
how
happy
we
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
wonder
if
the
dear
grandfather
hear
all
this
,
for
Margaret
do
not
speak
in
an
undertone
;
but
no
!
<EOS>
he
be
far
too
deep
,
and
eager
in
solve
a
problem
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
even
notice
Mary
's
leave
-
taking
,
and
she
go
home
with
the
feeling
that
she
have
that
night
make
the
acquaintance
of
two
of
the
strange
people
she
ever
see
in
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
Margaret
,
so
quiet
,
so
commonplace
,
until
her
singing
power
be
call
forth
;
so
silent
from
home
,
so
cheerful
and
agreeable
at
home
;
and
her
grandfather
so
very
different
to
any
one
Mary
have
ever
see
.
 
<EOS>
Margaret
have
say
he
be
not
a
fortune
-
teller
,
but
she
do
not
know
whether
to
believe
her
.
  
<EOS>
to
resolve
her
doubt
,
she
tell
the
history
of
the
evening
to
her
father
,
who
be
interested
by
her
account
,
and
curious
to
see
and
judge
for
himself
.
 
<EOS>
opportunity
be
not
often
want
where
inclination
go
before
,
and
ere
the
end
of
that
winter
Mary
look
upon
Margaret
almost
as
an
old
friend
.
 
<EOS>
the
latter
would
bring
her
work
when
Mary
be
likely
to
be
at
home
in
the
evening
and
sit
with
her
;
and
Job
Legh
would
put
a
book
and
his
pipe
in
his
pocket
and
just
step
round
the
corner
to
fetch
his
grandchild
,
ready
for
a
talk
if
he
find
Barton
in
;
ready
to
pull
out
pipe
and
book
if
the
girl
want
him
to
wait
,
and
John
be
still
at
his
club
.
 
<EOS>
in
short
,
ready
to
do
whatever
would
give
pleasure
to
his
darle
Margaret
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
point
of
resemblance
,
or
dissimilitude
(
for
this
join
people
as
often
as
that
)
attract
the
two
girl
to
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
Margaret
have
the
great
charm
of
possess
good
strong
common
sense
,
and
do
you
not
perceive
how
involuntarily
this
be
value
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
pleasant
to
have
a
friend
who
possess
the
power
of
set
a
difficult
question
in
a
clear
light
;
whose
judgment
can
tell
what
be
good
to
be
do
;
and
who
be
so
convinced
of
what
be
"
wise
,
good
,
"
that
in
consideration
of
the
end
,
all
difficulty
in
the
way
diminish
.
 
<EOS>
People
admire
talent
,
and
talk
about
their
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
value
common
sense
without
talk
about
it
,
and
often
without
know
it
.
  
<EOS>
so
Mary
and
Margaret
grow
in
love
one
toward
the
other
;
and
Mary
tell
many
of
her
feeling
in
a
way
she
have
never
do
before
to
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
Most
of
her
foible
also
be
make
known
to
Margaret
,
but
not
all
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
cherish
weakness
still
conceal
from
every
one
.
 
<EOS>
It
concern
a
lover
,
not
beloved
,
but
favour
by
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
a
gallant
,
handsome
young
man
;
but
 
not
beloved
.
 
<EOS>
yet
Mary
hope
to
meet
him
every
day
in
her
walk
,
blush
when
she
hear
his
name
,
and
try
to
think
of
him
as
her
future
husband
,
and
above
all
,
try
to
think
of
herself
as
his
future
wife
.
 
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
poor
Mary
!
<EOS>
Bitter
woe
do
thy
weakness
work
thee
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
other
lover
.
 
<EOS>
one
or
two
would
gladly
have
keep
her
company
,
but
she
hold
herself
too
high
,
they
say
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
Wilson
say
nothing
,
but
love
on
and
on
,
ever
more
fondly
;
he
hope
against
hope
;
he
would
not
give
up
,
for
it
seem
like
give
up
life
to
give
up
thought
of
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
dare
to
look
to
any
end
of
all
this
;
<EOS>
the
present
,
so
that
he
see
her
,
touch
the
hem
of
her
garment
,
be
enough
.
 
<EOS>
surely
,
in
time
,
such
deep
hope
would
beget
love
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
not
relinquish
hope
,
and
yet
her
coldness
of
manner
be
enough
to
daunt
any
man
;
and
it
make
Jem
more
despairing
than
he
would
acknowledge
for
a
long
time
even
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
but
one
evening
he
come
round
by
Barton
's
house
,
a

Margaret

asleep
before

<EOS>
She
have
come
in
to
speak
to
Mary
;
and
wear

out
by
a
long
,
work
,
watch
night

she
fall
asleep
in
the
genial
warmth

an
old

saying
about
a
pair
of
glove
come
into
Jem

and
step
gently
up

he
kiss
Margaret
with
a
friendly
kiss

<EOS>
She
awake

and
perfectly
understand
the
thing
,
she
say
,
"
<EOS>
for
shame
of
yourself

Jem

<EOS>
what
would
Mary
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
lightly

lightly
answer

"
She
would
nobbut

practice
make
perfect

<EOS>
and
they
both
laugh
.
<EOS>
but
the
word
Margaret
have
say
rankle
in
Jem
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Would
Mary
care
?
 
<EOS>
Would
she
care
in
the
very
least
?
 
<EOS>
They
seem
to
call
for
an
answer
by
night
and
by
day
;
and
Jem
feel
that
his
heart
tell
him
Mary
be
quite
indifferent
to
any
action
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
still
he
love
on

and
on

ever
more
fondly

<EOS>
Mary
's
father
be
well
aware
of
the
nature
of
Jem
Wilson
's
feeling
for
his
daughter
,
but
he
take
no
notice
of
them
to
any
one
,
think
Mary
full
young
yet
for
the
care
of
married
life
,
and
unwilling
,
too
,
to
entertain
the
idea
of
part
with
her
at
any
time
,
however
distant
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
welcome
Jem
at
his
house
,
as
he
would
have
do
his
father
's
son
,
whatever
be
his
motive
for
come
;
and
now
and
then
admit
the
thought
,
that
Mary
may
do
bad
,
when
her
time
come
,
than
marry
Jem
Wilson
,
a
steady
workman
at
a
good
trade
,
a
good
son
to
his
parent
,
and
a
fine
manly
spirit
chap
 
at
least
when
Mary
be
not
by
;
for
when
she
be
present
he
watch
her
too
closely
,
and
too
anxiously
,
to
have
much
of
what
John
Barton
call
"
spunk

in

<EOS>
It
be
towards
the
end
of
February
,
in
that
year
,
and
a
bitter
black
frost
have
last
for
many
week
.
 
<EOS>
the
keen
east
wind
have
long
since
sweep
the
street
clean
,
though
in
a
gusty
day
the
dust
would
rise
like
pound
ice
,
and
make
people
's
face
quite
smart
with
the
cold
force
with
which
it
blow
against
them
.
 
<EOS>
Houses
,
sky
,
people
,
and
everything
look
as
if
a
gigantic
brush
have
wash
them
all
over
with
a
dark
shade
of
indian
ink
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
some
reason
for
this
grimy
appearance
on
human
being
,
whatever
there
may
be
for
the
dun
look
of
the
landscape
;
for
soft
water
have
become
an
article
not
even
to
be
purchase
;
and
the
poor
washerwoman
may
be
see
vainly
try
to
procure
a
little
by
break
the
thick
grey
ice
that
coat
the
ditch
and
pond
in
the
neighbourhood

<EOS>
People
prophesy
a
long
continuance
to
this
already
lengthen
frost
;
say
the
spring
would
be
very
late
;
no
spring
fashion
require
;
no
summer
clothing
chase
for
a
short
uncertain
summer
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
there
be
no
end
to
the
evil
prophesy
during
the
continuance
of
that
bleak
east
wind

Mary
hurry
home
one
evening

just
as

from
Miss

with
her

so
she

I

I

They

<EOS>
by
this

Mary
have
break
up
the

light
her

and
Margaret
settle
herself
to
her
work
on
one
side

the
table

while
her

hurry
over
her
tea
at
the

<EOS>
the
thing
be
then
lift
en
masse
to
the
dresser
;
and
dust
her
side
of
the
table
with
the
apron
she
always
wear
at
home
,
Mary
take
up
some
breadth
and
begin
to
run
them
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
it
all
for
,
for
if
you
tell
me
I
have
forget

"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
for
Mrs.
Ogden
as
keep
the
greengrocer
's
shop
in
Oxford
Road
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
drink
himself
to
death
,
and
though
she
cry
over
him
and
his
way
all
the
time
he
be
alive
,
she
be
fret
sadly
for
him
now
he
be
dead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
he
leave
her
much
to
go
upon
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Mary
,
examine
the
texture
of
the
dress
.
 
<EOS>
"
this
be
beautifully
fine
soft
bombazine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
be
much
afeard
<EOS>
there
be
but
little
,
and
there
be
several
young
child
,
besides
the
three
Miss
Ogdens
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
think
girl
like
them
would
ha
'
make
their
own
gown
,
"
observe
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
I
dare
say
they
do
,
many
a
one
,
but
now
they
seem
all
so
busy
get
ready
for
the
funeral
;
for
it
be
to
be
quite
a
grand
affair
,
well
-
nigh
twenty
people
to
breakfast
,
as
one
of
the
little
one
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
little
thing
seem
to
like
the
fuss
,
and
I
do
believe
it
comfort
poor
Mrs.
Ogden
to
make
all
the
piece
o
'
work
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
smell
of
ham
boiling
and
fowl
roast
while
I
wait
in
the
kitchen
<EOS>
;
it
seem
more
like
a
wedding
nor
*
a
funeral
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
she
would
spend
a
matter
o
'
sixty
pound
on
th
'
burial
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
say
she
be
but
badly
off
,
"
say
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
I
know
she
be
ask
for
credit
at
several
place
,
say
her
husband
lay
hand
on
every
farthing
he
could
get
for
drink
.
 
<EOS>
but
th
'
undertaker
urge
her
on
,
you
see
,
and
tell
her
this
thing
's
usual
,
and
that
thing
be
only
a
common
mark
of
respect
,
and
that
everybody
have
t'other
thing
,
till
the
poor
woman
have
no
<EOS>
will
o
<EOS>
'
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
too
<EOS>
,
her
heart
strike
her
(
it
always
do
when
a
person
be
go
)
for
many
a
word
and
many
a
slight
deed
to
him
who
be
stiff
and
cold
;
and
she
think
to
make
up
matter
,
as
it
be
,
by
a
grand
funeral
,
though
she
and
all
her
child
,
too
,
may
have
to
pinch
many
a
year
to
pay
the
expense
,
if
ever
they
pay
them
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
this
mourning
,
too
,
will
cost
a
pretty
penny
,
"
say
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
often
wonder
why
folk
wear
mourning
;
it
be
not
pretty
or
become
;
and
it
cost
a
deal
of
money
just
when
people
can
spare
it
least
;
and
if
what
the
Bible
tell
us
be
true
,
we
ought
not
to
be
sorry
when
a
friend
,
who
be
be
good
,
go
to
his
rest
;
and
as
for
a
bad
man
,
one
's
glad
enough
to
get
<EOS>
shut
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
see
what
good
come
out
<EOS>
o
'
wear
mourning
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
I
think
the
fancy
be
send
for
(
old
Alice
call
everything
"
send
for
,
"
and
I
believe
she
be
right
)
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
do
good
,
though
not
as
much
as
it
cost
,
that
I
do
believe
,
in
set
people
(
as
be
cast
down
by
sorrow
and
feel
themselves
unable
to
settle
to
anything
but
cry
)
something
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
why
now
I
tell
you
how
they
be
grieve
;
for
,
perhaps
,
he
be
a
kind
husband
and
father
,
in
his
thoughtless
way
,
when
he
be
not
in
liquor
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
cheer
up
wonderful
while
I
be
there
,
and
I
ask
'em
for
more
direction
than
usual
,
that
they
may
have
something
to
talk
over
and
fix
about
;
and
I
leave
'em
my
fashion
-
book
(
though
it
be
two
month
old
)
just
a
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
every
one
would
grieve
a
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Alice
would
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Old
Alice
be
one
in
a
thousand
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
,
too
,
if
she
would
fret
much
,
however
sorry
she
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
say
it
be
send
,
and
fall
to
try
to
find
out
what
good
it
be
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
every
sorrow
in
her
mind
be
send
for
good
.
 
<EOS>
do
I
ever
tell
you
,
Mary
,
what
she
say
one
day
when
she
find
me
take
on
about
something
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
do
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
you
fret
about
,
first
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
you
,
just
now
;
perhaps
I
may
some
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
when
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
this
very
evening
,
if
it
rise
in
my
heart
;
perhaps
never
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
fear
that
sometimes
I
can
not
abide
to
think
about
,
and
sometimes
I
do
not
like
to
think
on
anything
else
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
be
fret
about
this
fear
,
and
Alice
come
in
for
something
,
and
find
me
cry
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
tell
her
no
more
than
I
would
you
,
Mary
;
so
she
say
,
"
well
,
dear
,
you
must
mind
this
,
when
you
be
go
to
fret
and
be
low
about
anything
 
<EOS>
an
anxious
mind
be
never
a
holy
mind

"
 
<EOS>
o
Mary
,
I
have
so
often
check
my
grumble
sin
'
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
she
say
that
.
"
     
<EOS>
the
weary
sound
of
stitching
be
the
only
sound
hear
for
a
little
while
,
till
Mary
inquire
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
expect
to
get
pay
for
this
mourning
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
do
not
much
think
I
shall
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
think
it
over
once
or
twice
,
and
I
mean
to
bring
myself
to
think
I
shall
not
,
and
to
like
to
do
it
as
my
bit
towards
comfort
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
they
can
pay
,
and
yet
they
be
just
the
sort
of
folk
to
have
their
mind
easy
for
wear
mourning
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
only
one
thing
I
dislike
make
black
for
,
it
do
so
hurt
the
eye
.
"
  
<EOS>
Margaret
put
down
her
work
with
a
sigh
,
and
shade
her
eye
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
assume
a
cheerful
tone
,
and
say
   
"
You
will
not
have
to
wait
long
,
Mary
,
for
my
secret
be
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
,
do
you
know
I
sometimes
think
I
be
grow
a
little
blind
,
and
then
what
would
become
of
grandfather
and
me
?
 
<EOS>
oh
,
God
help
me
,
Lord
help
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
fall
into
an
agony
of
tear
,
while
Mary
kneel
by
her
,
strive
to
soothe
and
to
comfort
her
:
but
,
like
an
inexperienced
person
,
strive
rather
to
deny
the
correctness
of
Margaret
's
fear
,
than
help
her
to
meet
and
overcome
the
evil
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Margaret
,
quietly
fix
her
tearful
eye
on
Mary
;
"
I
know
I
be
not
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
feel
one
go
some
time
,
long
before
I
ever
think
what
it
would
lead
to
;
and
last
autumn
I
go
to
a
doctor
;
and
he
do
not
mince
the
matter
,
but
say
unless
I
sit
in
a
darkened
room
,
with
my
hand
before
me
,
my
sight
would
not
last
me
many
year
longer
.
 
<EOS>
but
how
could
I
do
that
,
Mary
?
 
<EOS>
for
one
thing
,
grandfather
would
have
know
there
be
somewhat
the
matter
;
and
,
oh
!
<EOS>
it
will
grieve
him
sore
whenever
he
be
tell
,
so
the
later
the
well
;
and
besides
,
Mary
,
we
have
sometimes
little
enough
to
go
upon
,
and
what
I
earn
be
a
great
help
.
 
<EOS>
for
grandfather
take
a
day
here
,
and
a
day
there
,
for
botanising
or
go
after
insect
,
and
he
will
think
little
enough
of
four
or
five
shilling
for
a
speciman
;
dear
grandfather
!
<EOS>
and
I
be
so
loath
to
think
he
should
be
stint
of

"

You

indeed

all

it

there
that
the

right

<EOS>
be
the
gable
end
of
the

a
house

from
its
size

its
handsome
stone
facing

and
the
attempt
at
ornament
in

have
probably
be
once
a

now
the

so
fearful

be
the
sight
when

there

gush
out
from

unwinke
anxiety
,
and
people
's
very
breathing
seem
stilled
in
suspense
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
be
nowhere
to
be
see
,
but
the
wind
appear
,
for
the
moment
,
high
than
ever
,
and
drive
back
the
invade
flame
to
the
other
end
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
and
Margaret
could
see
now
;
right
above
them
dance
the
ladder
in
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
the
crowd
press
back
from
under
;
firemen
's
helmet
appear
at
the
window
,
hold
the
ladder
firm
,
when
a
man
,
with
quick
,
steady
tread
,
and
unmoving
head
,
pass
from
one
side
to
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
the
multitude
do
not
even
whisper
while
he
cross
the
perilous
bridge
,
which
quiver
under
him
;
but
when
he
be
across
,
safe
comparatively
in
the
factory
,
a
cheer
arise
for
an
instant
,
check
,
however
,
almost
immediately
,
by
the
uncertainty
of
the
result
,
and
the
desire
not
in
any
way
to
shake
the
nerve
of
the
brave
fellow
who
have
cast
his
life
on
such
a
die
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
he
be
again
!
"
<EOS>
spring
to
the
lip
of
many
,
as
they
see
him
at
the
doorway
,
stand
as
if
for
an
instant
to
breathe
a
mouthful
of
the
fresher
air
,
before
he
trust
himself
to
cross
.
 
<EOS>
on
his
shoulder
he
bear
an
insensible
body
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
Jem
Wilson
and
his
father
,
"
whisper
Margaret
;
but
Mary
know
it
before
.
 
<EOS>
the
people
be
sick
with
anxious
terror
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
no
longer
balance
himself
with
his
arm
;
everything
must
depend
on
nerve
and
eye
.
 
<EOS>
They
see
the
latter
be
fix
,
by
the
position
of
the
head
,
which
never
waver
;
the
ladder
shake
under
the
double
weight
;
but
still
he
never
move
his
head
 
<EOS>
he
dare
not
look
below
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
an
age
before
the
crossing
be
accomplish
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
the
window
be
gain
;
the
bearer
relieve
from
his
burden
;
both
have
disappear
.
  
<EOS>
then
the
multitude
may
shout
;
and
above
the
roar
flame
,
loud
than
the
blowing
of
the
mighty
wind
,
arise
that
tremendous
burst
of
applause
at
the
success
of
the
dare
enterprise
.
 
<EOS>
then
a
shrill
cry
be
hear
,
ask
   
<EOS>
"
be
the
oud
man
alive
,
and
likely
to
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
"
answer
one
of
the
fireman
to
the
hushed
crowd
below
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
come
round
finely
,
now
he
be
have
a
dash
of
cowd
water
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
draw
back
his
head
;
and
the
eager
inquiry
,
the
shout
,
the
sea
-
like
murmur
of
the
move
roll
mass
begin
again
to
be
hear
 
but
only
for
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
in
far
less
time
than
even
that
in
which
I
have
endeavour
briefly
to
describe
the
pause
of
event
,
the
same
bold
hero
step
again
upon
the
ladder
,
with
evident
purpose
to
rescue
the
man
yet
remain
in
the
burn
mill
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
across
in
the
same
quick
steady
manner
as
before
,
and
the
people
below
,
make
less
acutely
anxious
by
his
previous
success
,
be
talk
to
each
other
,
shout
out
intelligence
of
the
progress
of
the
fire
at
the
other
end
of
the
factory
,
tell
of
the
endeavour
of
the
fireman
at
that
part
to
obtain
water
,
while
the
closely
-
pack
body
of
man
heave
and
roll
from
side
to
side
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
different
from
the
former
silent
breathless
hush
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
if
it
be
from
this
cause
,
or
from
the
recollection
of
peril
past
,
or
that
he
look
below
,
in
the
breathing
moment
before
return
with
the
remain
person
(
a
slight
little
man
)
<EOS>
sling
across
his
shoulder
,
but
Jem
Wilson
's
step
be
less
steady
,
his
tread
more
uncertain
;
he
seem
to
feel
with
his
foot
for
the
next
round
of
the
ladder
,
to
waver
,
and
finally
to
stop
half
-
way
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
crowd
be
still
enough
;
in
the
awful
instant
that
intervene
no
one
durst
speak
,
even
to
encourage
.
 
<EOS>
many
turn
sick
with
terror
,
and
shut
their
eye
to
avoid
see
the
catastrophe
they
dread
.
 
<EOS>
It
come
.
 
<EOS>
the
brave
man
sway
from
side
to
side
,
at
first
as
slightly
as
if
only
balance
himself
;
but
he
be
evidently
lose
nerve
,
and
even
sense
<EOS>
;
it
be
only
wonderful
how
the
animal
instinct
of
self
-
preservation
do
not
overcome
every
generous
feeling
,
and
impel
him
at
once
to
drop
the
helpless
,
inanimate
body
he
carry
;
perhaps
the
same
instinct
tell
him
,
that
the
sudden
loss
of
so
heavy
a
weight
would
of
itself
be
a
great
and
imminent
danger
.
  
<EOS>
"
help
me
;
she
be
faint
,
"
cry
Margaret
.
 
<EOS>
but
no
one
heed
.
 
<EOS>
all
eye
be
direct
upwards
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
point
of
time
a
rope
,
with
a
running
noose
,
be
dexterously
throw
by
one
of
the
fireman
,
after
the
manner
of
a
lasso
,
over
the
head
and
round
the
body
of
the
two
man
.
 
<EOS>
true
,
it
be
with
rude
and
slight
adjustment
:
<EOS>
but
slight
as
it
be
,
it
serve
as
a
steady
guide
;
it
encourage
the
sink
heart
,
the
dizzy
head
.
 
<EOS>
once
more
Jem
step
onwards
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
hurry
by
any
jerk
or
pull
.
 
<EOS>
slowly
and
gradually
the
rope
be
haul
in
,
slowly
and
gradually
do
he
make
the
four
or
five
pace
between
him
and
safety
.
 
<EOS>
the
window
be
gain
,
and
all
be
save
.
<EOS>
the
multitude
in
the
street
absolutely
dance
with
triumph
,
and
huzzaed
,
and
yell
till
you
would
have
fancy
their
very
throat
would
crack
;
and
then
,
with
all
the
fickleness
of
interest
characteristic
of
a
large
body
of
people
,
press
and
stumbled
,
and
curse
and
swear
,
in
the
hurry
to
get
out
of
Dunham
Street
,
and
back
to
the
immediate
scene
of
the
fire
,
the
mighty
diapason
of
whose
roaring
flame
form
an
awful
accompaniment
to
the
scream
,
and
yell
,
and
imprecation
,
of
the
struggle
crowd
.
  
<EOS>
as
they
press
away
,
Margaret
be
leave
,
pale
and
almost
sink
under
the
weight
of
Mary
's
body
,
which
she
have
preserve
in
an
upright
position
by
keep
her
arm
tight
round
Mary
's
waist
,
dreading
,
with
reason
,
the
trampling
of
unheeding
foot
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
she
gently
let
her
down
on
the
cold
clean
pavement
;
and
the
change
of
posture
,
and
the
difference
in
temperature
,
now
that
the
people
have
withdraw
from
their
close
neighbourhood
,
speedily
restore
her
to
consciousness
.
  
<EOS>
Her
first
glance
be
bewilder
and
uncertain
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
forget
where
she
be
.
 
<EOS>
Her
cold
,
hard
bed
feel
strange
;
the
murky
glare
in
the
sky
affright
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
shut
her
eye
to
think
,
to
recollect
.
  
<EOS>
Her
next
look
be
upwards
.
 
<EOS>
the
fearful
bridge
have
be
withdraw
;
the
window
be
unoccupied
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
safe

"
say
Margaret
.
  
<EOS>
"
all

<EOS>
be
all
safe

Margaret

"
ask
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
ask
yon
fireman
,
and
he
will
tell
you
more
about
it
than
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
know
they
be
all
safe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
fireman
hastily
corroborate
Margaret
's
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
let
Jem
Wilson
go
twice
?
"
ask
Margaret
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
 
why
,
we
could
not
hinder
him

<EOS>
as
soon
as
ever
he
would
hear
his
father
speak
(
which
he
be
na
long
a
doing

,
Jem
be
off
like
a
shot
;
only
say
he
know
better
nor
us
where
to
find
t'other
man

<EOS>
We
would
all
ha

go

if
he
have
na
be
in
such
a
hurry
,
for
no
one
can
say
as
Manchester
fireman
be
ever
backward
when
there
be
danger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
run
off
;
and
the
two
girl
,
without
remark
or
discussion
,
turn
homeward
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
overtake
by
the
eld
Wilson
,
pale
,
grimy
,
and
blear
-
eyed
,
but
apparently
,
as
strong
and
well
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
He
loiter
a
minute
or
two
alongside
of
them
give
an
account
of
his
detention
in
the
mill
;
he
then
hastily
wish
good
-
night
,
say
he
must
go
home
and
tell
his
missis
he
be
all
safe
and
well
:
<EOS>
but
after
he
have
go
a
few
step
,
he
turn
back
,
come
on
Mary
's
side
of
the
pavement
,
and
in
an
earnest
whisper
,
which
Margaret
could
not
avoid
hearing
,
he
say
   
"
Mary
,
if
my
boy
come
across
you
to
-
night
,
give
him
a
kind
word
or
two
for
my
sake

<EOS>
do

<EOS>
bless
you
,
there
be
a
good
wench

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
hang
her
head
and
answer
not
a
word
,
and
in
an
instant
he
be
go
.
  
<EOS>
when
they
arrive
at
home
,
they
find
John
Barton
smoke
his
pipe
,
unwilling
to
question
;
yet
very
willing
to
hear
all
the
detail
they
could
give
him
.
 
<EOS>
Margaret
go
over
the
whole
story
,
and
it
be
amusing
to
watch
his
gradually
increase
interest
and
excitement
.
<EOS>
first
,
the
regular
puffing
abate
,
then
cease
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
pipe
be
fairly
take
out
of
his
mouth
,
and
hold
suspend
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
rise
,
and
at
every
further
point
he
come
a
step
nearer
to
the
narrator
.
  
<EOS>
when
it
be
end
he
swear
(
an
unusual
thing
for
him
)
that
if
Jem
Wilson
want
Mary
he
should
have
her
tomorrow
,
if
he
have
not
a

<EOS>
Margaret
laugh
,
but
Mary

who
be
now
recover
from
her
agitation

pout
and
look
angry
.

the
work

they
have

but
with

ANCHESTER

<EOS>
John
Barton
be
not
far
wrong
in
his
idea
<EOS>
that
the
Messrs.
Carson
would
not
be
over
-
much
grieved
for
the
consequence
of
the
fire
in
their
mill
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
well
insure
;
the
machinery
lack
the
improvement
of
late
year
,
and
work
but
poorly
in
comparison
with
that
which
may
now
be
procure
.
 
<EOS>
above
all
,
trade
be
very
slack
;
cotton
could
find
no
market
,
and
good
lay
pack
and
pile
in
many
a
warehouse
.
 
<EOS>
the
mill
be
merely
work
to
keep
the
machinery
,
human
and
metal
,
in
some
kind
of
order
and
readiness
for
well
time
.
 
<EOS>
so
this
be
an
excellent
opportunity
,
Messrs.
Carson
think
,
for
refit
their
factory
with
first
-
rate
improvement
,
for
which
the
insurance
money
would
amply
pay
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
in
no
hurry
about
the
business
,
however
.
 
<EOS>
the
weekly
drain
of
wage
give
for
labour
,
useless
in
the
present
state
of
the
market
,
be
stop

<EOS>
the

have
more
leisure
than
they
have
know
for

and
promise

all
manner
of
pleasant
excursion
,
as
soon
as
the
weather
should
become
more
genial

<EOS>
It
be
a
pleasant
thing
to
be
able
to
lounge
over
breakfast
with
a
review

newspaper
in

to
have
time

agreeable

accomplished

on

no
money

but
whose
father
,
shut
up
during
a
long
day
with
calico

have
so
seldom
have
leisure
to
enjoy
their
daughter

there

happy
family
evening

now
that
the

domestic
enjoyment

<EOS>
there
be
another
side
to

<EOS>
there
be
home
over
which
Carsons
'
fire
throw
a
deep
,
terrible
gloom
;
the
home
of
those
who
would
fain
work
,
and
no
man
give
unto
them
 
the
home
of
those
to
whom
leisure
be
a
curse
.
<EOS>
there
,
the
family
music
be
hungry
wail
,
when
week
after
week
pass
by
,
and
there
be
no
work
to
be

,
and
consequently
no
wage
to
pay
for
the
bread

child
cry
aloud
for
in
their
young
impatience
of
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
breakfast
to
lounge
over
;
their
lounge
be
take
in

,
to
try
and
keep
warmth
in
them
that
bitter
March
weather
,
and
,
by
be
quiet

to
deaden
the
gnaw
wolf
within

many

enough
in

buy

make

It
be

<EOS>
the
evil
and
the
good
of
our

come
out
strongly
then

there

desperate

there

bitter

tongued
mother
(
o
God

<EOS>
what

<EOS>

there

there
be
"
love

;
and
self

denial
,
among
rude
,
coarse
man
,
akin
to
that
of
Sir
Philip
Sidney
's
most
glorious
deed
.
 
<EOS>
the
vice
of
the
poor
sometimes
astound
us
here
;
but
when
the
secret
of
all
heart
shall
be
make
known
,
their
virtue
will
astound
us
in
far
great
degree
.
 
<EOS>
of
this
I
be
certain
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
cold
,
bleak
spring
come
on
(
spring

in
name
alone
)
,
and
consequently
as

dead

turn
off

and
finally
stop
work
altogether
.
  
<EOS>
Barton
work
short

<EOS>
Wilson
,
of
course
,
be
a
hand
in
carson

have
no

<EOS>
but
his

,
work
at
an
engineer
's
,
and
a
steady
man
,
obtain
wage
enough
to
maintain
all
the
family
in
a
careful
way
.
 
<EOS>
still
it
prey
on
Wilson
's
mind
to
be
so
long
indebted
to
his
son
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
out
of
spirit
,
and
depressed
.
<EOS>
Barton
be
morose
,
and
sour
towards
mankind
as
a
body
,
and
the
rich
in
particular
.
 
<EOS>
one
evening
,
when
the
clear
light
at
six
o'clock
contrast
strangely
with
the
Christmas
cold
,
and
when
the
bitter
wind
pipe
down
every
entry
,
and
through
every
cranny
,
Barton
sit
brood
over
his
stint
fire
,
and
listen
for
Mary
's
step
,
in
unacknowledged
trust
that
her
presence
would
cheer
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
door
be
open
,
and
Wilson
come
breathless
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
You

ask

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
I
han

I
tell

"
say
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
Wilson
look
disappointed
.
 
<EOS>
Barton
try
not
to
be
interested
,
but
he
could
not
help
it
in
spite
of
his
gruffness
.
 
<EOS>
He
rise
,
and
go
to
the
cupboard
(
his
wife
's
pride
long
ago
)
.
 
<EOS>
there
lie
the
remain
of
his
dinner
,
hastily
put
by
ready
for
supper
.
 
<EOS>
Bread
,
and
a
slice
of
cold
fat
boil
bacon
.
 
<EOS>
He
wrap
them
in
his
handkerchief
,
put
them
in
the
crown
of
his
hat
,
and
say
,
"
come
,
let
us
be
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
go
 
art
thou
go
to

this
time
o

?
<EOS>
"
  
"
no
,
stupid
,
to
be
sure
not
.
 
<EOS>
go
to
see
the
chap
thou
speak
on
.
<EOS>
"
so
they
put
on
their
hat
and
set
out
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
way
Wilson
say
Davenport
be
a
good
fellow
,
though
too
much
of
the
Methodee
;
that
his
child
be
too
young
to
work
,
but
not
too
young
to
be
cold
and
hungry
;
that
they
have
sink
lower
and
low
,
and
pawn
thing
after
thing
,
and
that
they
now
live
in
a
cellar
in
Berry
Street
,
off
Store
Street
.
 
<EOS>
Barton
growl
inarticulate
word
of
no
benevolent
import
to
a
large
class
of
mankind
,
and
so
they
go
along
till
they
arrive
in
Berry
Street
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
unpaved
:
and
down
the
middle
a
gutter
force
its
way
,
every
now
and
then
form
pool
in
the
hole
with
which
the
street
abound
.
 
<EOS>
never
be
the
old
Edinburgh
cry
of
Gardez
l'eau
!
<EOS>
more
necessary
than
in
this
street
.
<EOS>
as
they
pass
,
woman
from
their
door
toss
household
slop
of
every
description
into
the
gutter
;
they
run
into
the
next
pool
,
which
overflow
and
stagnate
.
 
<EOS>
heap
of
ashe
be
the
stepping
-
stone
,
on
which
the
passer
-
by
,
who
care
in
the
least
for
cleanliness
,
take
care
not
to
put
his
foot
.
 
<EOS>
Our
friend
be
not
dainty
,
but
even
they
pick
their
way
,
till
they
get
to
some
step
lead
down
to
a
small
area
,
where
a
person
stand
would
have
his
head
about
one
foot
below
the
level
of
the
street
,
and
may
at
the
same
time
,
without
the
least
motion
of
his
body
,
touch
the
window
of
the
cellar
and
the
damp
muddy
wall
right
opposite
.
 
<EOS>
You
go
down
one
step
even
from
the
foul
area
into
the
cellar
in
which
a
family
of
human
being
live
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
dark
inside
.
 
<EOS>
the
window
-
pane
,
many
of
them
,
be
break
and
stuff
with
rag
,
which
be
reason
enough
for
the
dusky
light
that
pervade
the
place
even
at
midday
.
<EOS>
after
the
account
I
have
give
of
the
state
of
the
street
,
no
one
can
be
surprised
that
on
go
into
the
cellar
inhabit
by
Davenport
,
the
smell
be
so
foetid
as
almost
to
knock
the
two
man
down
.
 
<EOS>
quickly
recover
themselves
,
as
those
inure
to
such
thing
do
,
they
begin
to
penetrate
the
thick
darkness
of
the
place
,
and
to
see
three
or
four
little
child
roll
on
the
damp
,
nay
wet
brick
floor
,
through
which
the
stagnant
,
filthy
moisture
of
the
street
ooze
up
;
the
fire
-
place
be
empty
and
black
;
the
wife
sit
on
her
husband
's
lair
,
and
cry
in
the
dark
loneliness
.
  
<EOS>
"
see
,
missis
<EOS>
,
I
be
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
hold
your

child

<EOS>
;
here

"
     
<EOS>
in
that
dim
light
,
which
be
darkness
to
stranger
,
they
cluster
round
Barton
,
and
tear
from
him
the
food
he
have
bring
with
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
large
hunch
of
bread
,
but
it
vanish
in
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
mun
do
summut

"
say
he
to
Wilson
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yo
stop
here
,
and
I
will
be
back
in
half
-
an

hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
he
stride
,
and
run
,
and
hurried
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
empty
into
the
ever
-
useful
pocket
-
handkerchief
the
little
meal
remain
in
the
mug
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
would
have
her
tea
at
Miss
Simmonds
'
;
her
food
for
the
day
be
safe
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
go
upstairs
for
his
well
coat
,
and
his
one
,
gay
red
-
and
-
yellow
silk
pocket
-
handkerchief
 
<EOS>
his
jewel
,
his
plate
,
his
valuable
,
these
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
to
the
pawn
-
shop
;
he
pawn
them
for
five
shilling
;
he
stop
not
,
nor
stay
,
till
he
be
once
more
in
London
Road
,
within
five
minute
'
walk
of
Berry
Street
 
<EOS>
then
he
loiter
in
his
gait
,
in
order
to
discover
the
shop
he
want
.
 
<EOS>
He
buy
meat
,
and
a
loaf
of
bread
,
candle
,
chip
,
and
from
a
little
retail
yard
he
purchase
a
couple
of
hundredweight
of
coal
.
 
<EOS>
some
money
still
remain
 
all
destine
for
them
,
but
he
do
not
yet
know
how
good
to
spend
it
.
 
<EOS>
food
,
light
,
and
warmth
<EOS>
,
he
have
instantly
see
be
necessary
;
for
luxury
he
would
wait
.
 
<EOS>
Wilson
's
eye
fill
with
tear
when
he
see
Barton
enter
with
his
purchase
.
<EOS>
He
understand
it
all
,
and
long
to
be
once
more
in
work
that
he
may
help
in
some
of
these
material
way
,
without
feel
that
he
be
use
his
son
's
money
.
 
<EOS>
but
though
"
silver
and
gold
he
have
none
,
"
he
give
heart
-
service
and
love
 
work
of
far
more
value
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
John
Barton
behind
in
these
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
fever
"
be
(
as
it
usually
be
in
Manchester
)
of
a
low
,
putrid
,
typhoid
kind
;
bring
on
by
miserable
living
,
filthy
neighbourhood
,
and
great
depression
of
mind
and
body
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
virulent
,
malignant
,
and
highly
infectious
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
poor
be
fatalist
with
regard
to
infection
!
<EOS>
and
well
for
them
it
be
so
,
for
in
their
crowded
dwelling
no
invalid
can
be
isolate
.
<EOS>
Wilson
ask
Barton
if
he
think
he
should
catch
it
,
and
be
laugh
at
for
his
idea
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
man
,
rough
,
tender
nurse
as
they
be
,
light
the
fire
,
which
smoke
and
puff
into
the
room
as
if
it
do
not
know
the
way
up
the
damp
,
unused
chimney
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
smoke
seem
purifying
and
healthy
in
the
thick
clammy
air
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
clamour
again
for
bread
;
but
this
time
Barton
take
a
piece
first
to
the
poor
,
helpless
,
hopeless
woman
,
who
still
sit
by
the
side
of
her
husband
,
listen
to
his
anxious
miserable
muttering
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
the
bread
,
when
it
be
put
into
her
hand
,
and
break
a
bit
,
but
could
not
eat
.
<EOS>
She
be
past
hunger
.
 
<EOS>
She
fall
down
on
the
floor
with
a
heavy
unresisting
bang
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
look
puzzled
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
wellnigh
clem
,
"
say
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
"
Folk
do
say
one
must
not
give
clemmed
people
much
to
eat
;
but
,
bless
us
,
she
will
eat
nought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
yo
what
I
will
do
,
"
say
Wilson
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
these
two
big
lad
,
as
do
nought
but
fight
,
home
to
my
missis
for
tonight
,
and
I
will
get
a
jug
o
'
tea
.
 
<EOS>
Them
woman
always
do
best
with
tea
,
and
such
-
like
slop
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
Barton
be
now
leave
alone
with
a
little
child
,
cry
(
when
it
have
do
eat
)
for
mammy
;
with
a
faint
,
dead
-
like
woman
;
and
with
the
sick
man
,
whose
muttering
be
rise
up
to
scream
and
shriek
of
agonised
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
He
carry
the
woman
to
the
fire
,
and
chafe
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
around
for
something
to
raise
her
head
.
<EOS>
there
be
literally
nothing
but
some
loose
brick
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
those
he
get
;
and
take
off
his
coat
he
cover
them
with
it
as
well
as
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
He
pull
her
foot
to
the
fire
,
which
now
begin
to
emit
some
faint
heat
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
round
for
water
,
but
the
poor
woman
have
be
too
weak
to
drag
herself
out
to
the
distant
pump
,
and
water
there
be
none
.
 
<EOS>
He
snatch
the
child
,
and
run
up
the
area
-
step
to
the
room
above
,
and
borrow
their
only
saucepan
with
some
water
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
begin
,
with
the
useful
skill
of
a
working
-
man
,
to
make
some
gruel
;
and
when
it
be
hastily
make
,
he
seize
a
battered
iron
table
-
spoon
(
keep
when
many
other
little
thing
have
be
sell
in
a
lot
,
in
order
to
feed
baby
)
,
and
with
it
he
force
one
or
two
drop
between
her
clenched
tooth
.
 
<EOS>
the
mouth
open
mechanically
to
receive
more
,
and
gradually
she
revive
.
 
<EOS>
She
sit
up
and
look
round
;
and
recollect
all
,
fall
down
again
in
weak
and
passive
despair
.
 
<EOS>
Her
little
child
crawl
to
her
,
and
wipe
with
its
finger
the
thick
-
come
tear
which
she
now
have
strength
to
weep
.
<EOS>
It
be
now
high
time
to
attend
to
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
lie
on
straw
,
so
damp
and
mouldy
,
no
dog
would
have
choose
it
in
preference
to
flag
;
over
it
be
a
piece
of
sack
,
come
next
to
his
worn
skeleton
of
a
body
;
above
him
be
muster
every
article
of
clothing
that
could
be
spare
by
mother
or
child
this
bitter
weather
;
and
in
addition
to
his
own
,
these
may
have
give
as
much
warmth
as
one
blanket
,
could
they
have
be
keep
on
him
;
but
as
he
restlessly
toss
to
and
fro
,
they
fall
off
and
leave
him
shiver
in
spite
of
the
burn
heat
of
his
skin
.
 
<EOS>
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
he
start
up
in
his
naked
madness
,
look
like
the
prophet
of
woe
in
the
fearful
plague
-
picture
;
but
he
soon
fall
again
in
exhaustion
,
and
Barton
find
he
must
be
closely
watch
,
l
in
these
fall
he
should
injure
himself
against
the
hard
brick
floor
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
thankful
when
Wilson
re
-
appear
,
carry
in
both
hand
a
jug
of
steam
tea
,
intend
for
the
poor
wife
;
but
when
the
delirious
husband
see
drink
,
he
snatch
at
it
with
animal
instinct
,
with
a
selfishness
he
have
never
show
in
health
.
  
<EOS>
then
the
two
man
consult
together
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
decide
,
without
a
word
be
speak
on
the
subject
,
that
both
should
spend
the
night
with
the
forlorn
couple
;
that
be
settle
.
 
<EOS>
but
could
no
doctor
be
have
?
 
<EOS>
in
all
probability
,
no
;
the
next
day
an
infirmary
order
must
be
beg
,
but
meanwhile
the
only
medical
advice
they
could
have
must
be
from
a
druggist
's
.
 
<EOS>
so
Barton
<EOS>
(
be
the
moneyed
man
)
set
out
to
find
a
shop
in
London
Road
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
pretty
sight
to
walk
through
a
street
with
light
shop
;
the
gas
be
so
brilliant
,
the
display
of
good
so
much
more
vividly
show
than
by
day
,
and
of
all
shop
a
druggist
's
look
the
most
like
the
tale
of
our
childhood
,
from
Aladdin
's
garden
of
enchant
fruit
to
the
charming
Rosamond
with
her
purple
jar
.
 
<EOS>
no
such
association
have
Barton
;
yet
he
feel
the
contrast
between
the
well
-
fill
,
well
-
light
shop
and
the
dim

it
make
him
moody
that
such
contrast
should
exist

<EOS>
They
be
the
mysterious
problem
of
life
to
more
than
him

<EOS>
He
wonder
if
any
in
all
the
hurry
crowd
have
come
from
such
a
house
of
mourning
.
 
<EOS>
He
think
they
all
look
joyous

and
he
be
angry
with
them

<EOS>
but
he
could
not
<EOS>
,
you
can
not

read
the
lot
of
those
who
daily
pass
you
by

<EOS>
how
do
you
know
the
wild
romance
of
their
life
;
the
trial
,
the
temptation
they
be
even
now
endure
,
resist
,
sink
under

<EOS>
You
may
be
elbow
one
instant
by
the
girl
desperate
in
her
abandonment
,
laugh
in
mad
merriment
with
her
outward
gesture
,
while
her
soul
be
long
for
the
rest
of
the
dead
,
and
bring
itself
to
think
of
the
cold
flow
river
as
the
only
mercy
of
God
remain
to
her
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
pass
the
criminal
,
meditate
crime
at
which
you
will
to

morrow
shudder
with
horror
as
you
read
them

<EOS>
You
may
push
against
one
,
humble
and
unnoticed
,
the
last
upon
earth
,
who
in
heaven
will
for
ever
be
in
the
immediate
light
of
God

<EOS>
Errands
of

errand
of

do
you

<EOS>
Barton
's
be
an
errand
of
mercy
;
but
the
thought
of
his
heart
be
touch
by
sin
,
by
bitter
hatred
of
the
happy
,
whom
he
,
for
the
time
,
confound
with
the
selfish
.
  
<EOS>
He
reach
a
druggist

shop
,
and
enter
.
 
<EOS>
the
druggist
(
whose
smooth
manner
seem
to
have
be
salve
over
with
his
own
spermaceti
)
listen
attentively
to
Barton
's
description
of
Davenport
's
illness
;
conclude
it
be
typhus
fever
,
very
prevalent
in
that
neighbourhood
;
and
proceed
to
make
up
a
bottle
of
medicine
,
sweet
spirit
of
nitre
,
or
some
such
innocent
potion
,
very
good
for
slight
cold
,
but
utterly
powerless
to
stop
,
for
an
instant
,
the
rage
fever
of
the
poor
man
it
be
intend
to
relieve
.
 
<EOS>
He
recommend
the
same
course
they
have
previously
determine
to
adopt
,
apply
the
next
morning
for
an
infirmary
order
;
and
Barton
leave
the
shop
with
comfortable
faith
in
the
physic
give
him
;
for
man
of
his
class
,
if
they
believe
in
physic
at
all
,
believe
that
every
description
be
equally
efficacious
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
Wilson
have
do
what
he
could
at
Davenport
's
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
soothe
,
and
cover
the
man
many
a
time
;
he
have
feed
and
hush
the
little
child
,
and
speak
tenderly
to
the
woman
,
who
lie
still
in
her
weakness
and
her
weariness
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
open
a
door
,
but
only
for
an
instant
;
it
lead
into
a
back
cellar
,
with
a
grating
instead
of
a
window
,
down
which
drop
the
moisture
from
pigsty
,
and
bad
abomination
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
pave
;
the
floor
be
one
mass

bad

mud

<EOS>
It
have
never

for
there
be
not
an

in
it

nor
could
a
human
being

much
less
a

have
live
there
many

<EOS>
yet
the

make
a

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
when

turn
round
again

he

the

"

She
finish

<EOS>
Wilson
cover
her
with
his
coat
as
well
as
he
could
,
and
try
to
move
lightly
,
for
fear
of
disturb
her
;
but
there
need
have
be
no
such
dread
,
for
her
sleep
be
profound
and
heavy
with
exhaustion

<EOS>
once
only
she
rouse

pull
the

<EOS>
round
her

<EOS>
and
now
Wilson

and
<EOS>
Barton
's
to

be
want
to
restrain
the
wild
mad
agony
of
the

<EOS>
He
start
up
,
he
yell
,
he
seem
infuriate
by
overwhelming
anxiety

<EOS>
He
curse
and
swear
,
which
surprise
Wilson
,
who
know
his
piety
in
health
,
and
who
do
not
know
the
unbridled
tongue
of
delirium
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
he
seem
exhausted
,
and
fall
asleep
;
and
Barton
and
Wilson
draw
near
the
fire
,
and
talk
together
in
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
They
sit
on
the
floor
,
for
chair
there
be
none

the

be
an

turn
upside

<EOS>
They
put
out
the

converse
by

"

I

It

Han

<EOS>
but
Wilson
be
no
arguer
;
no
speechifier
,
as
he
would
have
call
it

<EOS>
so
Barton
,
see
he
be
likely
to
have
it
his
own
way

go
on

"
You

I

our

our

we

They

somehow
a

how

besides

there

the

Can

there
be

<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
well

Barton

I
will
not

Mr.

speak
to

he

Han

ask

in

<EOS>
"
I

continue
he

to

off

I
would
scorn

when
I
see
such

there
die
away

for
very
clemming

I
can
not
stand
it

I

she
keep
herself
pretty
much

I

we

that

"
  
<EOS>
and
in
this
kind
of
talk
the
night
,
the
long
heavy
night
of
watching
,
wear
away
.
 
<EOS>
as
far
as
they
could
judge
,
Davenport
continue
in
the
same
state
,
although
the
symptom
vary
occasionally
.
 
<EOS>
the
wife
sleep
on
,
only
rouse
by
the
cry
of
her
child
now
and
then
,
which
seem
to
have
power
over
her
,
when
far
loud
noise
fail
to
disturb
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
watcher
agree
,
that
as
soon
as
it
be
likely
Mr.
Carson
would
be
up
and
visible
,
Wilson
should
go
to
his
house
,
and
beg
for
an
infirmary
order
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
the
grey
dawn
penetrate
even
into
the
dark
cellar
.
 
<EOS>
Davenport
sleep
,
and
Barton
be
to
remain
there
until
Wilson
's
return
;
so
,
step
out
into
the
fresh
air
,
brisk
and
reviving
,
even
in
that
street
of
abomination
<EOS>
,
Wilson
take
his
way
to
Mr.
Carson
's
.
  
<EOS>
Wilson
have
about
two
mile
to
walk
before
he
reach
Mr.
Carson
's
house
,
which
be
almost
in
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
the
street
be
not
yet
bustling
and
busy
.
 
<EOS>
the
shopman
be
lazily
take
down
the
shutter
,
although
it
be
near
eight
o'clock
;
for
the
day
be
long
enough
for
the
purchase
people
make
in
that
quarter
of
the
town
,
while
trade
be
so
flat
.
 
<EOS>
one
or
two
miserable
-
look
woman
be
set
off
on
their
day
's
beg
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
few
people
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
's
be
a
good
house
,
and
furnish
with
disregard
to
expense
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
in
addition
to
lavish
expenditure
,
there
be
much
taste
show
,
and
many
article
choose
for
their
beauty
and
elegance
adorn
his
room
.
 
<EOS>
as
Wilson
pass
a
window
which
a
housemaid
have
throw
open
,
he
see
picture
and
gilding
,
at
which
he
be
tempt
to
stop
and
look
;
but
then
he
think
it
would
not
be
respectful
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
hasten
on
to
the
kitchen
door
.
 
<EOS>
the
servant
seem
very
busy
with
preparation
for
breakfast
;
but
good
-
naturedly
,
though
hastily
,
tell
him
to
step
in
,
and
they
could
soon
let
Mr.
Carson
know
he
be
there
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
be
usher
into
a
kitchen
hang
round
with
glitter
tin
,
where
a
roar
fire
burn
merrily
,
and
where
number
of
utensil
hang
round
,
at
whose
nature
and
use
Wilson
amuse
himself
by
guess
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
servant
bustle
to
and
fro
;
an
outdoor
manservant
come
in
for
order
,
and
sit
down
near
Wilson
.
 
<EOS>
the
cook
broil
steak
,
and
the
kitchen
-
maid
toast
bread
,
and
boil
egg
.
  
<EOS>
the
coffee
steam
upon
the
fire
,
and
altogether
the
odour
be
so
mixed
and
appetising
,
that
Wilson
begin
to
yearn
for
food
to
break
his
fast
,
which
have
last
since
dinner
the
day
before
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
servant
have
know
this
,
they
would
have
willingly
give
him
meat
and
bread
in
abundance
;
but
they
be
like
the
rest
of
us
,
and
not
feel
hunger
themselves
,
forget
it
be
possible
<EOS>
another
might
.
 
<EOS>
so
Wilson
's
craving
turn
to
sickness
,
while
they
chat
on
,
make
the
kitchen
's
free
and
keen
remark
upon
the
parlour
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
late
you
be
last
night
,
Thomas
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
be
right
weary
of
wait

they
tell
me
to
be
at
the
room
by
twelve
;
and
there
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
two
o'clock
before
they
call
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
you
wait
all
that
time
in
the
street
?
"
<EOS>

He
could
not

<EOS>
the
trump

set

the
source
of
tear
be
open
by
sympathy
in
the
widow
,
and
her
full
heart
be
,
for
a
time
,
relieve
.
  
<EOS>
and
Mary
forget
<EOS>
all
purpose
meeting
with
her
gay
lover
,
Harry
Carson
;
forget
Miss
Simmonds
'
errand
,
and
her
anger
,
in
the
anxious
desire
to
comfort
the
poor
lone
woman
.
 
<EOS>
never
have
her
sweet
face
look
more
angelic
,
never
have
her
gentle
voice
seem
so
musical
as
when
she
murmur
her
broken
sentence
of
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
do
not
cry
so
,
dear
Mrs.
Davenport
,
pray
do
not
take
on
so
.
 
<EOS>
sure
he
be
go
<EOS>
where
he
will
never
know
care
again
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
I
know
how
lonesome
you
must
feel
;
but
think
of
your
child
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
we
will
all
help
to
earn
food
for
'em
.
 
<EOS>
think
how
sorry
he'd
be
,
if
he
see
you
fret
so
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
cry
so
,
please
do
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
she
end
by
cry
herself
as
passionately
as
the
poor
widow
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
agree
the
town
must
bury
him
;
he
have
pay
to
a
burial
club
as
long
as
he
could
,
but
by
a
few
week
'
omission
,
he
have
forfeit
his
claim
to
a
sum
of
money
now
.
 
<EOS>
Would
Mrs.
Davenport
and
the
little
child
go
home
with
Mary
?
 
<EOS>
the
latter
brighten
up
as
she
urge
this
plan
;
but
no
!
<EOS>
where
the
poor
,
fondly
love
remain
be
,
there
would
the
mourner
be
;
and
all
that
they
could
do
be
to
make
her
as
comfortable
as
their
fund
would
allow
,
and
to
beg
a
neighbour
to
look
in
and
say
a
word
at
time
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
be
leave
alone
with
her
dead
,
and
they
go
to
work
that
have
work
,
and
he
who
have
none
,
take
upon
him
the
arrangement
for
the
funeral
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
have
many
a
scolding
from
Miss
Simmonds
that
day
for
her
absence
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
Miss
Simmonds
be
much
put
out
by
Mary
's
non
-
appearance
in
the
morning
with
certain
bit
of
muslin
,
and
shade
of
silk
which
be
want
to
complete
a
dress
to
be
wear
that
night
;
but
it
be
true
enough
that
Mary
do
not
mind
what
she
be
about
;
she
be
too
busy
plan
how
her
old
black
gown
(
her
good
when
her
mother
die
)
may
be
sponge
,
and
turn
,
and
lengthen
into
something
like
decent
mourning
for
the
widow
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
she
go
home
at
night
(
though
it
be
very
late
,
as
a
sort
of
retribution
for
her
morning
's
negligence
)
,
she
set
to
work
at
once
,
and
be
so
busy
and
so
glad
over
her
task
,
that
she
have
,
every
now
and
then
,
to
check
herself
in
singe
merry
ditty
,
which
she
feel
little
accord
with
the
sewing
on
which
she
be
engage
.
  
<EOS>
so
when
the
funeral
day
come
,
Mrs.
Davenport
be
neatly
array
in
black
,
a
satisfaction
to
her
poor
heart
in
the
midst
of
her
sorrow
.
<EOS>
Barton
and
Wilson
both
accompany
her
,
as
she
lead
her
two
elder
boy
,
and
follow
the
coffin
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
simple
walk
funeral
,
with
nothing
to
grate
on
the
feeling
of
any
;
far
more
in
accordance
with
its
purpose
,
to
my
mind
,
than
the
gorgeous
hearse
,
and
nodding
plume
,
which
form
the
grotesque
funeral
pomp
of
respectable
people
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
"
rattle
the
bone
over
the
stone
,
"
of
the
pauper
's
funeral
.
 
<EOS>
decently
and
quietly
be
he
follow
to
the
grave
by
one
determine
to
endure
her
woe
meekly
for
his
sake
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
mark
of
pauperism
attendant
on
the
burial
concern
the
living
and
joyous
,
far
more
than
the
dead
,
or
the
sorrowful
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
arrive
in
the
churchyard
,
they
halt
before
a
raise
and
handsome
tombstone
;
in
reality
a
wooden
mockery
of
stone
respectability
which
adorn
the
burial
-
ground
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
easily
raise
in
a
very
few
minute
,
and
below
be
the
grave
in
which
pauper
body
be
pile
until
within
a
foot
or
two
of
the
surface
;
when
the
soil
be
shovel
over
,
and
stamp
down
,
and
the
wooden
cover
go
to
do
temporary
duty
over
another
hole
.

little
recked
they
of
this

now
give
up

JEM

"
how

<EOS>
oh

what

<EOS>
the

like
fever
be
not

brave
with
impunity

and
balk
of
its
prey

<EOS>
the
widow
have
reclaim
her
child
;
her
neighbour
,
in
the
good
-
samaritan
sense
of
the
word
,
have
pay
her
little
arrear
of
rent
,
and
make
her
a
few
shilling
beforehand
with
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
determine
to
flit
from
that
cellar
to
another
less
full
of
painful
association
,
less
haunt
by
mournful
memory
.
 
<EOS>
the
Board
,
not
so
formidable
as
she
have
imagine
,
have
inquire
into
her
case
;
and
,
instead
of
send
her
to
Stoke
Claypole
,
her
husband
's
Buckinghamshire
parish
,
as
she
have
dread
,
have
agree
to
pay
her
rent
.
 
<EOS>
so
food
for
four
mouth
be
all
she
be
now
require
to
find
;
only
for
three
she
would
have
say
;
for
herself
and
the
unweaned
child
be
but
reckon
as
one
in
her
calculation
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
a
strong
heart
,
now
her
bodily
strength
have
be
recruit
by
a
week
or
two
of
food
,
and
she
would
not
despair
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
take
in
some
little
child
to
nurse
,
who
bring
their
daily
food
with
them
,
which
she
cook
for
them
,
without
wrong
their
helplessness
of
a
crumb
;
and
when
she
have
restore
them
to
their
mother
at
night
,
she
set
to
work
at
plain
sewing
,
"
seam
,
and
gusset
,
and
band
,
"
and
sit
think
how
she
may
best
cheat
the
factory
inspector
,
and
persuade
him
that
her
strong
,
big
,
hungry
Ben
be
above
thirteen

<EOS>
Her
plan
of
living
be
so
far
arrange
,
when
she
hear
,
with
keen
sorrow
,
that
Wilson

twin
lad
be
ill
of
the
fever
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
never
be
strong
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
like
many
a
pair
of
twin
,
and
seem
to
have
but
one
life
divide
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
one
life
,
one
strength
,
and
in
this
instance
,
I
may
almost
say
,
one
brain
,
for
they
be
helpless
,
gentle
,
silly
child
,
but
not
the
less
dear
to
their
parent

to
their
strong

active

manly

elder

<EOS>
They
be
late
on
their

late
in

late
every
way

have
to
be
nurse
and
care
for
when
other

of
their

be
tumble
about
in
the
street
,
and
lose
themselves
,
and
be
take
to
the
police

office
mile
away
from

<EOS>
still
want
have
never
yet
come
in
at
the
door
to
make
love
for
these
innocent
fly
out
of
the
window
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
this
the
case
even
now
,
when
Jem
Wilson
's
earning
,
and
his
mother
's
occasional
charing
,
be
barely
sufficient
to
give
all
the
family
their
fill
of
food
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
the
twin
,
after
ail
many
day
,
and
care
little
for
their
meat
,
fall
sick
on
the
same
afternoon
,
with
the

heavy
stupor
of
suffering

the
three

that
love
them
so

each
feel

though
none
acknowledge
to
the

that
they
have
little
chance
for

<EOS>
It
be
nearly
a
week
before
the
tale
of
their
illness
spread
as
far
as
the
court
where
the
Wilsons
have
once
dwelt
,
and
the
barton
yet
live

<EOS>
Alice
have
hear
of
the

have
lock
her

and
go
off
straight

but
she
be
often
absent
for
day
,
send
for
,
as
her
neighbour
know

to
help
in
some
sudden
emergency

Margaret

after

seriously
ill

<EOS>
She
tell
Mary
of
it
as
she
enter
the
court
late
that
evening
;
and
Mary
listen
with
sadden
heart
to
the
strange
contrast
which
such
woeful
tiding
present
to
the
gay
and
love
word
she
have
be

on
her
walk
home

<EOS>
She
blame

vision
of
the
golden

that
she
have
lately

seldom
on
Sunday
afternoon
,
or
other
leisure
time
,
to
see
Mrs.
Wilson
,
her
mother

and
with
hasty
purpose
of
amendment
she
only
stay
to
leave
a
message
for
her
father
with
the
next

neighbour
,
and
then
go
off
at
a
brisk
pace
on
her
way
to
the
house
of

She
stop
with

on

to
still
her
beat

listen
to
the

<EOS>
She
open
the
door
softly
;
there
sit
Mrs.

in
the
old
rocking

,
with
one
sick
death
-
like
boy
lie
on
her
knee
,
cry
without
let
or
pause
,
but
softly
,
gently
,
as
fear
to
disturb
the
troubled

child
;
while
behind
her
,
old
Alice
let
her
fast
-
drop
tear
fall
down
on
the
dead
body
of
the
other

over

anxiously

Mary

Mary

she

it
be

much
bad

<EOS>
at

Alice
shake

She

silent
in

and
again
Alice
speak
first

<EOS>
"
I
sometimes
think
the
Lord
be
against
planning
.
 
<EOS>
Whene'er
<EOS>
I
plan
overmuch
,
He
be
sure
to
send
and
mar
all
my
plan
,
as
if
He
would
ha
'
me
put
the
future
into
His
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Afore
Christmas
time
I
be
as
full
as
full
could
be
,
of
go
home
for
good
and
all
;
yo
han
hear
how
I
have
wish
it
this
terrible
long
time
.
 
<EOS>
and
a
young
lass
from
behind
Burton
come
into
place
in
Manchester
last
Martinmas
;
so
after
awhile
she
have
a
Sunday
out
,
and
she
come
to
me
,
and
tell
me
some
cousin
o
'
mine
bid
her
find
me
out
,
and
say
how
glad
they
should
be
to
ha
'
me
to
bide
wi
'
'em
,
and
look
after
th
'
childer
,
for
they'n
getten
a
big
farm
,
and
she
be
a
deal
to
do
among
th
'
cow
.
 
<EOS>
so
many
be
a
winter
's
night
<EOS>
do
I
lie
awake
and
think
,
that
please
God
,
come
summer
,
I
would
bid
George
and
his
wife
goodbye
,
and
go
home
at
last
.
<EOS>
little
do
I
think
how
God
Almighty
would
balk
me
,
for
not
leave
my
day
in
His
hand
,
who
have
lead
me
through
the
wilderness
hitherto
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
George
out
of
work
,
and
more
cast
down
than
ever
I
seed
him
;
want
every
chip
o
'
comfort
he
can
get
,
e'en
<EOS>
afore
this
last
heavy
stroke
;
and
now
I
be
think
the
Lord
's
finger
point
very
clear
to
my
fit
abiding
-
place
;
and
I
be
sure
if
George
and
Jane
can
say
"
His
will
be
do
,
"
it
be
no
more
than
what
I
be
behold
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
say
,
she
fall
to
tidy
the
room
,
remove
as
much
as
she
could
every
vestige
of
sickness
;
make
up
the
fire
,
and
set
on
the
kettle
for
a
cup
of
tea
for
her
sister
-
in

law
,
whose
low
moan
and
sobs
be
occasionally
hear
in
the

<EOS>
Mary
help
her
in
all
these
little

<EOS>
They
be
busy
in
this
way
when
the
door
be
softly
open
,
and
Jem
come
in
,
all
grimed
and
dirty
from
his
night

work
,
his
soil
apron
wrap
round
his
middle

in

and
apparel
in
which
he
would
have
be
sorry
at
another
time
to
have
be
see
by
Mary

<EOS>
but
just
now
he
hardly
see
her
;
he
go
straight
up
to
Alice
,
and
ask
how
the
little
chap
be
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
be
a
shade
better
at
dinner

time

and
he
have
be
work
away
through
the
long
afternoon
,
and
far
into
the
night
,
in
the
belief
that
they
have
take
the
turn

<EOS>
He
have
steal
out
during
the
half

hour
allow
at

work

to
buy
them
an
orange

which
now
puff
out

<EOS>
He
would
make
his

he

Jem
go
to
the
cupboard
,
and
quietly
extricate
from
his
pocket
the
orange
he
have
buy

<EOS>
but
he
stay
long
there

and
at

<EOS>
the

as

They
cry
afresh
in

<EOS>
Mary
's
heart
melt
within
her
as
she
witness
Jem
's
sorrow
,
and
she
step
gently
up
to
the
corner
where
he
stand
,
with
his
back
turn
to
them
,
and
put
her
hand
softly
on
his
arm
,
say
   
"
<EOS>
O
Jem
,
do
not
give
way
so
;
I
can
not
bear
to
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
feel
a
strange
leap
of
joy
in
his
heart
,
and
know
the
power
she
have
of
comfort
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
speak
,
as
though
fear
to
destroy
by
sound
or
motion
the
happiness
of
that
moment
,
when
her
soft
hand
's
touch
thrill
through
his
frame
,
and
her
silvery
voice
be
whisper
tenderness
in
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
it
may
be
very
wrong
;
he
could
almost
hate
himself
for
it
;
with
death
and
woe
so
surround
him
,
it
yet
be
happiness
,
be
bliss
,
to
be
so
spoken
to
by
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
,
Jem
,
please
do
not
,
"
whisper
she
again
,
believe
that
his
silence
be
only
another
form
of
grief
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
not
contain
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
take
her
hand
in
his
firm
yet
tremble
grasp
,
and
say
,
in
tone
that
instantly
produce
a
revulsion
in
her
mood
   
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
I
almost
loathe
myself
when
I
feel
I
would
not
give
up
this
minute
,
when
my
brother
lie
dead
,
and
father
and
mother
be
in
such
trouble
,
for
all
my
life
that
be
past
and
go

<EOS>
and
,
Mary

"
(
as
she
try
to
release
her
hand
)
<EOS>
,
"
you
know
what
make
me
feel
so
blessed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
do
know
 
<EOS>
he
be
right
there
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
he
turn
to
catch
a
look
at
her
sweet
face
,
he
see
that
it
express
unfeigned
distress
,
almost
amount
to
vexation
;
<EOS>
a
dread
of
him
,
that
he
think
be
almost
repugnance
.
  
<EOS>
He
let
her
hand
go
,
and
she
quickly
go
away
to
Alice
's
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
fool
that
I
be
 
nay
,
wretch
that
I
be
 
to
let
myself
take
this
time
of
trouble
to
tell
her
how
I
love
her
;
no
wonder
that
she
turn
away
from
such
a
selfish
beast
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
partly
to
relieve
her
from
his
presence
,
and
partly
from
natural
desire
,
and
partly
,
perhaps
,
from
a
penitent
wish
to
share
to
the
utmost
<EOS>
his
parent
'
sorrow
,
he
soon
go
upstairs
to
the
chamber
of
death
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
mechanically
help
Alice
in
all
the
duty
she
perform
through
the
remainder
of
that
long
night
,
but
she
do
not
see
Jem
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
remain
upstairs
until
after
the
early
dawn
show
Mary
that
she
need
have
no
fear
of
go
home
through
the
deserted
and
quiet
street
,
to
try
and
get
a
little
sleep
before
work
-
hour
.
 
<EOS>
so
leave
kind
message
to
George
and
Jane
Wilson
,
and
hesitate
whether
she
may
dare
to
send
a
few
kind
word
to
Jem
,
and
decide
that
she
have
well
not
,
she
step
out
into
the
bright
morning
light
,
so
fresh
a
contrast
to
the
darkened
room
where
death
have
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
 
<EOS>
another
morn
than
our
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
lie
down
on
her
bed
in
her
clothe
;
and
whether
it
be
this
,
or
the
broad
day
-
light
that
pour
in
through
the
sky
window
,
or
whether
it
be
over
-
excitement
,
it
be
long
before
she
could
catch
a
wink
of
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
Her
thought
run
on
Jem
's
manner
and
word
;
not
but
what
she
have
know
the
tale
they
tell
for
many
a
day
;
but
still
she
wish
he
have
not
put
it
so
plainly
.
  
<EOS>
"
o
dear
,
"
say
she
to
herself
,
"
I
wish
he
would
not
mistake
me
so
;
I
never
dare
to
speak
a
common
word
o
'
kindness
,
but
his
eye
brighten
and
his
cheek
flush
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
hard
on
me
;
for
father
and
George
Wilson
be
old
friend
;
and
Jem
and
I
ha
'
know
each
other
since
we
be
quite
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
what
possess
me
,
that
I
must
always
be
want
to
comfort
him
when
he
be
downcast
,
and
that
I
must
go
meddle
wi
'
him
to
-
night
,
when
sure
enough
it
be
his
aunt
's
place
to
speak
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
for
him
,
and
yet
,
unless
I
be
always
watch
myself
,
I
be
speak
to
him
in
a
loving
voice
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
not
go
right
,
for
I
either
check
myself
till
I
be
downright
cross
to
him
,
or
else
I
speak
just
natural
,
and
that
be
too
kind
and
tender
by
half
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
as
good
as
engage
to
be
married
to
another
;
and
another
far
handsome
than
Jem
;
only
I
think
I
like
Jem
's
face
best
for
all
that
;
like
's
like
,
and
there
be
no
help
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
when
I
be
Mrs.
Harry
Carson
,
may
happen
I
can
put
some
good
fortune
in
Jem
's
way
.
 
<EOS>
but
will
he
thank
me
for
it
?
 
<EOS>
He
be
rather
savage
at
time
,
that
I
can
see
,
and
perhaps
kindness
from
me
,
when
I
be
another
be
,
will
only
go
against
the
grain
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
plague
myself
wi
'
think
any
more
about
him
,
that
I
will
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
she
turn
on
her
pillow
,
and
fall
asleep
,
and
dreamt
of
what
be
often
in
her
wake
thought
;
of
the
day
when
she
should
ride
from
church
in
her
carriage
,
with
wedding
-
bell
ringing
,
and
take
up
her
astonished
father
,
and
drive
away
from
the
old
dim
work
-
a
-
day
court
for
ever
,
to
live
in
a
grand
house
,
where
her
father
should
have
newspaper
,
and
pamphlet
,
and
pipe
,
and
meat
dinner
every
day
 
and
all
day
long
if
he
like
.
  
<EOS>
such
thought
mingle
in
her
predilection
for
the
handsome
young
Mr.
Carson
,
who
,
unfettere
by
work
-
hour
,
let
scarcely
a
day
pass
without
contrive
a
meeting
with
the
beautiful
little
milliner
he
have
first
see
while
lounge
in
a
shop
where
his
sister
be
make
some
purchase
,
and
afterwards
never
rest
till
he
have
freely
,
though
respectfully
,
make
her
acquaintance
in
her
daily
walk
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
,
to
use
his
own
expression
to
himself
,
quite
infatuate
by
her
,
and
be
restless
each
day
till
the
time
come
when
he
have
a
chance
,
and
,
of
late
,
more
than
a
chance
of
meet
her
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
of
keen
practical
shrewdness
about
her
,
which
contrast
very
bewitchingly
with
the
simple
,
foolish
,
unworldly
idea
she
have
pick
up
from
the
romance
which
Miss
Simmonds
'
young
lady
be
in
the
habit
of
recommend
to
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
Mary
be
ambitious
,
and
do
not
favour
Mr.
Carson
the
less
because
he
be
rich
and
a
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
leaven
,
infuse
year
ago
by
her
Aunt
Esther
,
ferment
in
her
little
bosom
,
and
perhaps
all
the
more
,
for
her
father
's
aversion
to
the
rich
and
the
gentle
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
contrariness
of
the
human
heart
,
from
Eve
downward
,
that
we
all
,
in
our
old
Adam
state
,
fancy
thing
forbid
sweetest
.
<EOS>
so
Mary
dwell
upon
and
enjoy
the
idea
of
some
day
become
a
lady
,
and
do
all
the
elegant
nothing
appertain
to
ladyhood
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
comfort
to
her
,
when
scold
by
Miss
Simmonds
,
to
think
of
the
day
when
she
would
drive
up
to
the
door
in
her
own
carriage
,
to
order
her
gown
from
the
hasty
-
tempered
yet
kind
dressmaker
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
pleasure
to
her
to
hear
the
general
admiration
of
the
two
elder
Miss
Carsons
,
acknowledge
beauty
in
ball
-
room
and
street
,
on
horseback
and
on
foot
,
and
to
think
of
the
time
when
she
should
ride
and
walk
with
them
in
love
sisterhood
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
good
of
her
plan
,
the
holy
,
that
which
in
some
measure
redeem
the
vanity
of
the
rest
,
be
those
relate
to
her
father
;
her
dear
father
,
now
oppress
with
care
,
and
always
a
disheartened
,
gloomy
person
.
 
<EOS>
how
she
would
surround
him
with
every
comfort
she
could
devise
<EOS>
(
of
course
,
he
be
to
live
with
them
)
,
till
he
should
acknowledge
rich
to
be
very
pleasant
thing
,
and
bless
his
lady
-
daughter
!
 
<EOS>
every
one
who
have
show
her
kindness
in
her
low
estate
should
then
be
repay
a
hundredfold
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
the
castle
in
air
,
the
Alnaschar
-
vision
in
which
Mary
indulge
,
and
which
she
be
doom
in
after
day
to
expiate
with
many
tear
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
her
word
 
or
,
even
more
,
her
tone
 
would
maintain
their
hold
on
Jem
Wilson
's
memory
.
 
<EOS>
a
thrill
would
yet
come
over
him
when
he
remember
how
her
hand
have
rest
on
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
the
thought
of
her
mingle
with
all
his
grief
,
and
it
be
profound

for
the
loss
of

one

about
three

He

scrubbing
he
have
bestow
on
it
.
<EOS>
His
dark
black
hair
have
be
arrange
and
rearrange
before
the
household
looking
-
glass
,
and
in
his
button
-
hole
he
stick
a
narcissus
(
a
sweet
Nancy
be
its
pretty
Lancashire
name
)
,
hope
it
would
attract
Mary
's
notice
,
so
that
he
may
have
the
delight
of
give
it
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
bad
beginning
of
his
visit
of
happiness
that
Mary
see
him
some
minute
before
he
come
into
her
father
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
sit
at
the
end
of
the
dresser
,
with
the
little
window
-
blind
draw
on
one
side
,
in
order
that
she
may
see
the
passer
-
by
,
in
the
interval
of
read
her
Bible
,
which
lie
open
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
watch
all
the
greeting
a
friend
give
Jem
;
she
see
the
face
of
condolence
,
the
sympathetic
shake
of
the
hand
,
and
have
time
to
arrange
her
own
face
and
manner
before
Jem
come
in
,
which
he
do
,
as
if
he
have
eye
for
no
one
but
her
father
,
who
sit
smoke
his
pipe
by
the
fire
,
while
he
read
an
old
Northern
Star
,
borrow
from
a
neighbour
public
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
then
he
turn
to
Mary
,
who
,
he
feel
through
the
sure
instinct
of
love
,
by
which
almost
his
body
think
,
be
present
.
 
<EOS>
Her
hand
be
busy
adjust
her
dress
;
a
forced
and
unnecessary
movement
Jem
could
not
help
think
.
 
<EOS>
Her
accost
be
quiet
and
friendly
,
if
grave
;
she
feel
that
she
redden
like
a
rose
,
and
wish
she
could
prevent
it
,
while
Jem
wonder
if
her
blush
arise
from
fear
,
or
anger
,
or
love
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
very
cunning
<EOS>
,
I
be
afraid
.
 
<EOS>
She
pretend
to
read
diligently
,
and
not
to
listen
to
a
word
that
be
say
,
while
in
fact
she
hear
all
sound
,
even
to
Jem
's
long
,
deep
sigh
,
which
wring
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
she
take
up
her
Bible
,
and
as
if
their
conversation
disturb
her
,
go
upstairs
to
her
little
room
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
have
scarcely
speak
a
word
to
Jem
<EOS>
;
scarcely
look
at
him
;
never
notice
his
beautiful
sweet
Nancy
,
which
only
await
her
least
word
of
praise
to
be
hers
!
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
 
that
pang
be
spare
 
that
in
her
little
dingy
bedroom
stand
a
white
jug
,
fill
with
a
luxuriant
bunch
of
early
spring
rose
,
make
the
whole
room
fragrant
and
bright
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
the
gift
of
her
rich
lover
.
 
<EOS>
so
Jem
have
to
go
on
sit
with
John
Barton
,
fairly
catch
in
his
own
trap
,
and
have
to
listen
to
his
talk
,
and
answer
him
as
best
he
may
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
the
right
stuff
in
this
here
Star
,
and
no
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
right
-
down
piece
for
short
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
at
the
same
rate
of
wage
as
now
?
"
ask
Jem
.
  
<EOS>
"
aye
,
aye
!
<EOS>
else
where
be
the
use
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
take
out
o
'
the
master
'
pocket
what
they
can
well
afford
.
 
<EOS>
do
I
ever
tell
yo
<EOS>
what
th
'
Infirmary
chap
let
me
into
,
many
a
year
agone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
say
Jem
listlessly
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
!
yo
must
know
I
be
in
th
'
Infirmary
for
a
fever
,
and
time
be
rare
and
bad
,
and
there
be
good
chap
there
to
a
man
while
he
be
wick
,
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
whate'er
they
may
be
about
cut
him
up
at
after
.
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
 
<EOS>
so
when
I
be
well
o
'
th
'
fever
,
but
weak
as
water
,
they
say
to
me
,
say
they
,
"
if
yo
can
write
,
you
may
stay
in
a
week
longer
,
and
help
our

wi

and
we

and

<EOS>
Yo'll
be
twice
as
strong
in

.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
there
want
but
<EOS>
one
word
to
that
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
be
set
to
writing
and
copy
;
th
'
writing
I
could
do
well
enough
,
but
they
would
<EOS>
such
queer
way
<EOS>
o
'
spelling
,
that
I
would
ne'er
be
use
to
,
that
I
would
to
look
first
at
th

copy
and
then
at
my
letter
,
for
all
the
world
like
a

<EOS>
but
one
thing
startle
me
e'en
then
,
and
I
think
I
would
make
bold
to
ask
the
surgeon
<EOS>
the
meaning
o't
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
getten
no
head
for

but
this
I

that
by

TH

<EOS>
th

CHAUCER
,
the

<EOS>
Jem
be
ponder
Mary
's
conduct
;
but
the
pause
make
him
aware
he
ought
to
utter
some
civil
listening
noise
;
so
he
say
   
"
very
true
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
it

true

,
my

that
we
be

they'n

<EOS>
but
there

a

happen
afore

as
folk
do
not

.
 
<EOS>
Yo
may
take
my
word
for
that
,
Jem

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
be
very
willing
to
take
it
,
but
do
not
express
the
curiosity
he
should
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
so
John
Barton
think
he
would
try
another
hint
or
two
.
  
<EOS>
"
working
folk
will
not
be
grind
to

.
 
<EOS>
We'n
a

have

<EOS>
so
,
if
th

not
do
us
no
good
,
and
they
say
they
can
not
,
we
mun
try

.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
still
Jem
be
not
curious
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
up
hope
of
see
Mary
again
by
her
own
good
free
-
will
;
and
the
next
good
thing
would
be
,
to
be
alone
to
think
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
so
mutter
something
which
he
mean
to
serve
as
an
excuse
for
his
sudden
departure
,
he
hastily
wish
John
good
-
afternoon
,
and
leave
him
to
resume
his
pipe
and
his
politic
.
  
<EOS>
for
three
year
past
trade
have
be
get
bad
and
bad
,
and
the
price
of
provision
high
and
high
.
 
<EOS>
this
disparity
between
the
amount
of
the
earning
of
the
work
class
and
the
price
of
their
food
,
occasion
,
in
more
case
than
could
well
be
imagine
,
disease
and
death
.
 
<EOS>
whole
family
go
through
a
gradual
starvation
.
 
<EOS>
They
only
want
a
Dante
to
record
their
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
even
his
word
would
fall
short
of
the
awful
truth
;
they
could
only
present
an
outline
of
the
tremendous
fact
of
the
destitution
that
surround
thousand
upon
thousand
in
the
terrible
year
1839
,
1840
,
and
1841
.
 
<EOS>
even
philanthropist
who
have
study
the
subject
,
be
force
to
own
themselves
perplex
in
their
endeavour
to
ascertain
the
real
cause
of
the
misery
;
the
whole
matter
be
of
so
complicated
a
nature
,
that
it
become
next
to
impossible
to
understand
it
thoroughly
.
 
<EOS>
It
need
excite
no
surprise
,
then
,
to
learn
that
a
bad
feeling
between
work
-
man
and
the
upper
class
become
very
strong
in
this
season
of
privation
.
 
<EOS>
the
indigence
and
suffering
of
the
operative
induce
a
suspicion
in
the
mind
of
many
of
them
,
that
their
legislator
,
their
magistrate
,
their
employer
,
and
even
the
minister
of
religion
,
be
,
in
general
,
their
oppressor
and
enemy
;
and
be
in
league
for
their
prostration
and
enthralment
.
 
<EOS>
the
most
deplorable
and
enduring
evil
that
arise
out
of
the
period
of
commercial
depression
to
which
I
refer
,
be
this
feeling
of
alienation
between
the
different
class
of
society
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
impossible
to
describe
,
or
even
faintly
to
picture
,
the
state
of
distress
which
prevail
in
the
town
at
that
time
,
that
I
will
not
attempt
it
;
and
yet
I
think
again
that
surely
,
in
a
christian
land
,
it
be
not
know
even
so
feebly
as
word
could
tell
it
,
or
the
more
happy
and
fortunate
would
have
throng
with
their
sympathy
and
their
aid
.
 
<EOS>
in
many
instance
the
sufferer
weep
first
,
and
then
they
curse
.
 
<EOS>
Their
vindictive
feeling
exhibit
themselves
in
rabid
politic
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
hear
,
as
I
have
hear
,
of
the
suffering
and
privation
of
the
poor
,
of
provision
shop
where
ha'porth
of
tea
,
sugar
,
butter
,
and
even
flour
,
be
sell
to
accommodate
the
indigent
 
of
parent
sit
in
their
clothe
by
the
fireside
during
the
whole
night
,
for
seven
week
together
,
in
order
that
their
only
bed
and
bedding
may
be
reserve
for
the
use
of
their
large
family
 
of
other
sleep
upon
the
cold
hearthstone
for
week
in
succession
,
without
adequate
mean
of
provide
themselves
with
food
or
fuel
(
and
this
in
the
depth
of
winter
)
 
of
other
be
compel
to
fast
for
day
together
,
uncheere
by
any
hope
of
well
fortune
,
living
,
moreover
,
or
rather
starve
,
in
a
crowded
garret
,
or
damp
cellar
,
and
gradually
sink
under
the
pressure
of
want
and
despair
into
a
premature
grave
;
and
when
this
have
be
confirm
by
the
evidence
of
their
careworn
look
,
their
excited
feeling
,
and
their
desolate
home
 
<EOS>
can
I
wonder
that
many
of
them
,
in
such
time
of
misery
and
destitution
,
speak
and
act
with
ferocious
precipitation
?
  
<EOS>
an
idea
be
now
spring
up
among
the
operative
,
that
originate
with
the
Chartists
,
but
which
come
at
last
to
be
cherish
as
a
darle
child
by
many
and
many
a
one
.
 
<EOS>
They
could
not
believe
that
Government
know
of
their
misery
;
they
rather
choose
to
think
it
possible
that
man
could
voluntarily
assume
the
office
of
legislator
for
a
nation
who
be
ignorant
of
its
real
state
;
as
who
should
make
domestic
rule
for
the
pretty
behaviour
of
child
without
care
to
know
that
those
child
have
be
keep
for
day
without
food
.
<EOS>
besides
,
the
starve
multitude
have
hear
,
that
the
very
existence
of
their
distress
have
be
deny
in
Parliament
;
and
though
they
feel
this
strange
and
inexplicable
,
yet
the
idea
that
their
misery
have
still
to
be
reveal
in
all
its
depth
,
and
that
then
some
remedy
would
be
find
,
soothe
their
ache
heart
,
and
keep
down
their
rise
fury
.
  
<EOS>
so
a
petition
be
frame
,
and
sign
by
thousand
in
the
bright
spring
day
of
1839
,
implore
Parliament
to
hear
witness
who
could
testify
to
the
unparalleled
destitution
of
the
manufacturing
district
.
 
<EOS>
Nottingham
,
Sheffield
,
Glasgow
,
Manchester
,
and
many
other

be
busy
appoint
delegate
to
convey
this
petition
,
who
may
speak
,
not
merely
of
what
they
have
see

and
have
hear
,
but
from
what
they
have
bear
and
suffer

be
those
delegate

<EOS>
one
of
them
be
John
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
be
ashamed
to
own
the
flutter
of
spirit
his
appointment
give
him
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
childish
delight
of
see
London
 
that
go
a
little
way
,
and
but
a
little
way
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
vain
idea
of
speak
out
his
notion
before
so
many
grand
folk
 
<EOS>
that
go
a
little
further
;
and
last
,
there
be
the
really
pure
gladness
of
heart
arise
from
the
idea
that
he
be
one
of
those
choose
to
be
instrument
in
make
know
the
distress
of
the
people
,
and
consequently
in
procure
them
some
grand
relief
,
by
mean
of
which
they
should
never
suffer
want
or
care
any
more

<EOS>
He
hope
largely
,
but
vaguely
,
of
the
result
of
his
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
an
argosy
of
the
precious
hope
of
many
otherwise

be
that
petition
to
be

<EOS>
the
night
before
the
morning
on
which
the
Manchester
delegate
be
to
leave
for
London
,
Barton
may
be
say
to
hold
a
levee

so
many

<EOS>
Job

establish
himself

his
pipe

not

much

but
puff
away

and
imagine
himself
of
use
in
adjust
the
smoothing

that
hang

fire
,
ready
for

when
she
should

her

take

earn
a
decent
wage

what
I

speak

they

Mary

with

over

shade
them
from

its
disorder
before
go

wonder

morning
solitude

for
several
hour
when
the

strike
she
think
of
her

wonder
where
he
be
;
she
make
good
resolution
accord
to
her
light
;
and
by
-
and

bye
come
the
distraction
and
event
of
the
broad
full
day
to
occupy
her
with
the
present
,
and
to
deaden
the
memory
of
the
absent

<EOS>
one
of
Mary

resolution
be
,
that
she
would
not
be
persuade
or
induce
to
see
Mr.
Harry
Carson
during
her
father
's
absence
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
crooked
in
her
conscience
after
all
;
for
this
very
resolution
seem
an
acknowledgment
that
it
be
wrong
to
meet
him
at
any
time
;
and
yet
she
have
bring
herself
to
think
her
conduct
quite
innocent
and
proper
,
for
although
unknown
to
her
father
,
and
certain
,
even
do
he
know
it
,
to
fail
of
obtain
his
sanction
<EOS>
,
she
esteem
her
love
-
meeting
with
Mr.
Carson
as
sure
to
end
in
her
father
good
and
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
that
he
be
away
,
she
would
do
nothing
that
he
would
disapprove
of
;
no
,
not
even
though
it
be
for
his
own
good
in
the
end
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
amongst
Miss
Simmonds
'
young
lady
be
one
who
have
be
from
the
begin
a
confidante
in
Mary
's
love
affair
,
make
so
by
Mr.
Carson
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
feel
the
necessity
of
some
third
person
to
carry
letter
and
message
,
and
to
plead
his
cause
when
he
be
absent
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
girl
name
Sally
Leadbitter
he
have
find
a
willing
advocate
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
have
be
willing
to
have
embark
in
a
love
affair
herself
(
especially
a
clandestine
one
)
,
for
the
mere
excitement
of
the
thing
;
but
her
willingness
be
strengthen
by
sundry
half
-
sovereign
,
which
from
time
to
time
Mr.
Carson
bestow
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
Sally
Leadbitter
be
vulgar
-
minded
to
the
last
degree
;
never
easy
unless
her
talk
be
of
love
and
lover
;
in
her
eye
it
be
an
honour
to
have
have
a
long
list
of
wooer
.
 
<EOS>
so
constituted
,
it
be
a
pity
that
Sally
herself
be
but
a
plain
,
red

haired
,
freckle
girl
;
never
likely
,
one
would
have
think
,
to
become
a
heroine
on
her
own
account

<EOS>
but
what
she
lack
in
beauty
she
try
to
make
up
for
by
a
kind
of
witty
boldness
,
which
give
her
what
her
better
would
have
call
piquancy
.
 
<EOS>
consideration
of
modesty
or
propriety
never
check
her
utterance
of
a
good
thing
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
just
talent
enough
to
corrupt
other
.
 
<EOS>
Her
very
good
nature
be
an
evil
influence
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
hate
one
who
be
so
kind
;
they
could
not
avoid
one
who
be
so
willing
to
shield
them
from
scrape
by
any
exertion
of
her
own
;
whose
ready
finger
would
at
any
time
make
up
for
their
deficiency
,
and
whose
still
more
convenient
tongue
would
at
any
time
invent
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
the
Jews
,
or
Mohammedans
(
I

believe
that
there
be
one
little
bone
of
our
body

one
of
the
vertebrae
,
if
I
remember
rightly
,
 
which
will
never
decay
and
turn
to
dust
,
but
will
lie
incorrupt
and
indestructible
in
the
ground
until
the
last
day
:
this
be
the
Seed
of
the
Soul
.
 
<EOS>
the
most
depraved
have
also
their
seed
of
the
Holiness
that
shall
one
day
overcome
their
evil
;
their
one
good
quality

lurk
hide
,
but
safe
,
among
all
the
corrupt
and
bad
.
  
<EOS>
Sally
's
seed
of
the
future
soul
be
her
love
for
her
mother
,
an
aged
bedridden
woman

<EOS>
for
her
she
have
self
-
denial
;
for
her
,
her
good
-
nature
rise
into
tenderness
;
to
cheer
her
lonely
bed
,
her
spirit
,
in
the
evening
,
when
her
body
be
often
woefully
tired
,
never
flag
,
but
be
ready
to
recount
the
event
of
the
day
,
to
turn
them
into
ridicule
,
and
to
mimic
,
with
admirable
fidelity
,
any
person
gift
with
an
absurdity
who
have
fall
under
her
keen
eye
.
<EOS>
but
the
mother
be
lightly
principle
like
Sally
herself
;
nor
be
there
need
to
conceal
from
her
the
reason
why
Mr.
Carson
give
her
so
much
money
.
 
<EOS>
She
chuckle
with
pleasure
,
and
only
hope
that
the
wooing
would
be
long
a

doing
.
  
<EOS>
still
neither
she
,
nor
her
daughter

nor
Harry
Carson
like
this
resolution
of
Mary

not
to
see
him
during
her
father

absence

<EOS>
one
evening
(
and
the
early
summer
evening
be
long

bright

,
Sally
meet
Mr.
Carson
by
appointment
,
to
be
charge
with
a
letter
for
Mary
,
implore
her
to
see
him
,
which
Sally
be
to
back
with
all
her
power

persuasion

<EOS>
after
part
from
him
she
determine
,
as
it
be
not

very
late
,
to
go
at
once
to
Mary

Jem

his
claim
come
rush
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
though
not
guard
from
unnecessary
sight
or
sound
of
death
,
as
the
child
of
the
rich
be

yet
it
have
so
often
be

this
last
three
or
four
month

<EOS>
It

so
terrible
thus
to

<EOS>
Her
father

<EOS>
such
be
the
thought

<EOS>
She
could
not
go
to
comfort
the
bereave
,
even
if
comfort
be
in
her
power
to
give
;
for
she
have
resolve
to
avoid
Jem
;
and
she
feel
that
this
of
all
other
be
not
the
occasion
on
which
she
could
keep
up
a
studiously
cold
manner
.
  
<EOS>
and
in
this
shock
of
grief
,
Sally
Leadbitter
be
the
last
person
she
wish
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
she
rise
to
welcome
her
,
betray
her
tear
-
swollen
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
shall
tell
Mr.
Carson
to

can
tell
you

"
  
"
<EOS>
for
him
,

"
say
Mary
,
with
a
toss
of
her
pretty
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
miss
,
for
him
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
be
sigh
as
if
your
heart
would
break
now
for
several
day
,
over
your
work
;
now
arn't
you
a
little
goose
not
to
go
and
see
one
who
I
be
sure
love
you
as
his
life
,
and
whom
you
love
;
"
how
much
,
Mary
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
this
much
,
"
as
the
child
say
"
(
open
her
arm
very
wide
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
"
say
Mary
,
pout
;
"
I
often
think
I
do
not
love
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
be
to
tell
him
that
,
be
I
,
<EOS>
next
time
I
see
him

"
ask
Sally
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
like
,
"
reply
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
I
do
not
care
for
that
or
anything
else
now
"
;
weep
afresh
.
  
<EOS>
but
Sally
do
not
like
to
be
the
bearer
of
any
such
news
.
 
<EOS>
She
see
she
have
go
on
the
wrong
tack
,
and
that
Mary
's
heart
be
too
full
to
value
either
message
or
letter
as
she
ought
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
wisely
pause
in
their
delivery
and
say
,
in
a
more
sympathetic
tone
than
she
have
hitherto
use
   
"
<EOS>
do
tell
me
,
Mary
,
what
be
fret
you
so

<EOS>
You

to
see
you

<EOS>
"
I
will
tell

<EOS>
You
see
there
be
a
gentleman
lecture
on
music
at
th
'
Mechanics
'
,
and
he
want
folk
to
sing
his

.
 
<EOS>
well
,
last
night
the
counter
get
a
sore
throat
and
could
not

a
note
.
 
<EOS>
so
they
send
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
Jacob
Butterworth
have
say
a
good
word
for
me
,
and
they
ask
me
would
I
sing
?
 
<EOS>
You
may
think
I
be
frightened
,
but
I
think
,
now
or
never
,
and
say
I
would
do
my
good
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
try
o'er
the
song
wi
'
th
'
lecturer
,
and
then
th
'
manager
tell
me
I
be
to
make
myself
decent
and
be
there
by
seven
.

and
what
do
you
put
on
?
"
ask
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
why
do
not
you
come
in
for
my
pretty
pink
gingham
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
think
on't
;
but
you
have
na
come
home
then
.
 
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
I
put
on
my
merino
,
as
be
turn
last
winter
,
and
my
white
shawl
,
and
do
my
hair
pretty
tidy
;
it
do
well
enough
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
but
as
I
be
say
,
I
go
at
seven
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
to
read
my
music
,
but
I
take
th
'
paper
in
wi
'
me
,
to
ha
'
something
to
do
wi
'
my
finger
.
 
<EOS>
Th
'
folk
'
head
dance
,
as
I
stand
as
right
<EOS>
afore
<EOS>
'em
all
as
if
I
would
be
go
to
play
at
ball
wi
'
'em
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
guess
I
feel
squeamish
,
but
mine
be
not
the
first
song
,
and
th
'
music
sound
like
a
friend
's
voice
tell
me
to
take
courage
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
to
make
a
long
story
short
,
when
it
be
all
o'er
th
'
lecturer
thank
me
,
and
th
'
manager
say
as
how
there
never
be
a
new
singer
so
applaud
(
for
they
would
clap
and
stamp
after
I
would
do
,
till
I
begin
to
wonder
how
many
pair
o
'
shoe
<EOS>
they
would
get
through
a
week
at
that
rate
,
let
alone
their
hand

.
 
<EOS>
so
I
be
to
sing
again
o
'
Thursday
;
and
I
get
a
sovereign
last
night
,

be
to
have
half
-
a
-
sovereign
every
night

'
<EOS>
lecturer

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well

Margaret
,
I
be
right
glad
to
hear
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
do
not
think
you
have
hear
the
good
bit
yet
.
 
<EOS>
now
that
a
way
seem
open
to
me
,
of
not
be
a
burden
to
any
one
,
though
it
do
please
God
to
make
me
blind
,
I
think
I
would
tell
grandfather
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
tell'd
<EOS>
him
about
the
singing
and
the
sovereign
last
night
,
for
I
think
I
would
not
send
him
to
bed
wi
'
a
heavy
heart
;
but
this
morning
I
tell
him
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
how
do
he
take
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
not
a
man
of
many
word
;
and
it
take
him
by
surprise
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
at
that
;
I
have
notice
it
in
your
way
ever
since
you
tell
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
that
be
it
!
 
<EOS>
if
I
would
not

you
would
see
me
every
day

you
would
not
ha
'
notice
the
little
mite
o
'
difference
fra
'
day
to
day

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
,
but
what
do
your
grandfather
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
Mary
,
"
say
Margaret
,
half
smile
,
"
I
be
a
bit
loth
to
tell
yo
,
for
unless
yo
know
grandfather
's
way
like
me

,
yo'd
think
it
strange
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
take
by
surprise
,
and
he
say
:
"
damn
yo
!
"
 
<EOS>
then
he
begin
look
at
his
book
as
it
be
,
and
be
very
quiet
,
while
I
tell
him
all
about
it
;
how
I
would
fear
,
and
how
downcast
I
would
be
;
and
how
I
be
now
reconcile
to
it
,
if
it
be
th
'
Lord
's
will
;
and
how
I
hope
to
earn
money
by
singe
;
and
<EOS>
while
I
be
talk
,
I
see
great
big
tear
come
drop
on
th
'
book
;
but
in
course
I
never
let
on
that
I
see
'em
.
 
<EOS>
dear
grandfather
!
<EOS>
and
all
day
long
he
be
be
quietly
move
thing
out

o

<EOS>
my
way
,
as
he
think
may
trip
me
up
,
and
put
thing
in
my
way
as
he
think
I
may
want
;
never
know
I
see
and
feel
what
he
be
do
;
for
,
yo
see
,
he
think
I
be
out
and
out
blind

I
guess
 
as
I
shall
be
soon

Margaret

in
spite
of
her
cheerful
and
relieved
tone

<EOS>
though
Mary
catch
the
sigh
,
she
feel
it
be
well
to
let
it
pass
without
notice
,
and
begin
,
with
the
tact
which
true
sympathy
rarely
fail
to
supply
,
to
ask
a
variety
of
question
respect
her
friend
's
musical
debut
,
which
tend
to
bring
out
more
distinctly
how
successful
it

Would

before

I
be
practise
well
-
nigh
upon
two
hour
this
one
which
I
be
to
sing
o

Thursday

<EOS>
the
lecturer
say
he
be
sure
it
would
just
suit
me
,
and
I
should
do
justice
to
it
;
and
I
should
be
right
sorry
to
disappoint
him
,
he
be
so
nice

encouraging
like
to
me

<EOS>
eh

<EOS>
Mary
,
what
a

<EOS>
there
be
not
more
o

that
way

less
scold

<EOS>
It
would
go
a
vast
deal
further
.
 
<EOS>
beside
,
some
o

th

singer
say
,
they
be
a'most
certain
that
it
be
a
song
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
his
own
,
because
he
be
so
fidgety
and
particular
about
it
,
and
so
anxious
I
should
give
it
th
'
proper
expression
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
make
me
care
still
more
.
 
<EOS>
Th
'
first
verse
,
he
say
,
be
to
be
sing
"
tenderly
,

joyously
!

<EOS>
I
be
afraid
I
do
not

that

I
will
try

<EOS>
well

at

<EOS>
Job

<EOS>
"
well
,
them
undertaker
folk

drive
a

<EOS>

<EOS>
every

one
o

have
it

<EOS>
It
be

I
wonder
why
they
do
not
hire
a

rather
than
hang
on
like

I

th

they

and

<EOS>
one

and
some

after

a

,
to

after

John

It

<EOS>
as
long
as
I

our

abide
in

and
as

I
shall

I
will
not

no

<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
so
,
daunt
in
their
inquiry
,
they
sit
silent
for
a
few
minute
.
  
<EOS>
Old
Job
,
however
,
feel
that
some

must
speak
,
else
all
the
good
they
have
do
in
dispel
John
Barton
's
gloom
be
lose
.
 
<EOS>
so
after
a
while
he
think
of
a
subject
,
neither
sufficiently
dissonant
from
the
last
to
jar
on
a
full
heart
,
nor
too
much
the
same
to
cherish
the
continuance
of
the
gloomy
train
of
thought
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
ever
hear

"
say
he
to
Mary
,
"
that
I
be
in
London
once
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no

"
say
she
with
surprise

I

<EOS>
You
must
know
<EOS>
I
have
<EOS>
but
one
child
,
and
<EOS>
she
be
Margaret
's
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
her
above
a
bit
,
and
one
day
when
she
come
(
stand
behind
me
for
that
<EOS>
I
should
not
see
her
blush
,
and
stroke
my
cheek
in
her
own
coax
way
)
,
and
tell
me
she
and
Frank
Jennings
(
as
be
a
joiner
lodge
near
us
)
should
be
so
happy
<EOS>
if
they
be
married
,
I
could
not
find
in
my
heart
t
'
say
her
nay
,
though
I
go
sick
at
the
thought
of
lose
her
away
from
my
home
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
be
my
only
child
,
and
I
never
say
nought
of
what
I
feel
,
for
fear
o
'
grieve
her
young
heart
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
try
to
think
o
'
the
time
when
I
would
be
young
mysel
,
and
have
love
her
bless
mother
,
and
how
we
would
leave
father

mother
,
and
go
out
into
th

world
together
,
and
I
be
now
right
thankful
<EOS>
I
hold
my
peace
,
and
didna
fret
her
wi
'
tell
her
how
sore
I
be
at
part
wi
'
her
that
be
the
light
o

my
eye

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
say
Mary
,
"
you
say
the
young
man
be
a
neighbour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
so
he
be
,
and
his
father
afore
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
work
be
rather
slack
in
Manchester
,
and
Frank
's
uncle
send
him
<EOS>
word
o
'
London
work
and
London
wage
,
so
he
be
to
go
there
,
and
it
be
there
<EOS>
Margaret
be
to
follow
him
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
my
heart
ache
yet
at
thought
of
those
day

<EOS>
She
<EOS>
so
happy
,
and
he
so
happy
;
only
the
poor
father
as
fret
sadly
behind
their
back
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
marry
and
stay
some
day
wi

me
afore
set
off
;
and
I
have
often
think
sin

,
Margaret
's
heart
fail
her
many
a
time
those
few
day
,
and
she
would
fain
ha

;
but
I
know
fra

mysel
it
be
well
to
keep
it
pen
up
,
and
I
never
let
on
what
I
be

<EOS>
I
know
what
she
mean
when
she
come

,
and
hold
my
hand
,
and
all
her
old

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"

"
reply

<EOS>
"
well
,
them

<EOS>
She

in

and
I
believe
she

<EOS>
and
Frank

family
hear

be
in
good
work

<EOS>
in
one
o

her
letter
,
poor
thing
,
she
end
wi
'
say
,
"
Farewell
,
Grandad
!
"
<EOS>
wi
'
a
line
draw
under
grandad
,
and
fra
'
that
an
'
other
hint
I
know
she
be
in
th
'
family
way
;
and
<EOS>
I
say
nought
,
but
I
screw
up
a
little
money
,
think
come
<EOS>
Whitsuntide
<EOS>
I
would
take
a
holiday
and
go
and
see
her
an
'
th
'
little
one
.
 
<EOS>
but
one
day
towards
Whitsuntide
,
come
Jennings
wi
'
a
grave
face
,
and
say
he
,
"
I
hear
our
Frank
and
your
Margaret
's
both
getten
the
fever
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
You
may
ha
'
knock
me
down
wi
'
a
straw
,
for
it
seem
as
if
God
tell
me
what
th
'
upshot
would
be
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Jennings
have
get
a
letter
,
you
see
,
fra
'
the
landlady
they
lodge
wi
'
;
a
well
-
pen
letter
,
ask
if
they
would
no
friend
to
come
and
nurse
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
catch
it
first
,
and
Frank
,
who
be
as
tender
<EOS>
o'er
her
as
her
own
mother
could
ha
'
be
,
have
nurse
her
till
he
would
catch
it
himsel
;
and
she
expect
her
down-
lie
*
everyday
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
t
'
make
a
long
story
short
,
old
Jennings
<EOS>
and
I
go
up
by
that
night
's
coach
.
 
<EOS>
so
you
see
,
Mary
<EOS>
,
that
be
the
way
I
get
to
London
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
but
how
be
your
daughter
when
you
get
there
?
"
ask
Mary
anxiously
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
at
rest
,
poor
wench
,
and
so
be
Frank
.
 
<EOS>
I
guess
as
much
when
I
see'd
th
'
landlady
's
face
,
all
swell
wi
'
cry
,
when
she
open
th
'
door
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
We
say
,
"
where
be
they
?
"
<EOS>
and
I
know
they
be
dead
<EOS>
,
fra
'
her
look
;
but
Jennings
do
not
,
as
I
take
it
;
for
when
she
show
us
into
a
room
wi
'
a
white
sheet
on
th
'
bed
,
and
underneath
it
,
plain
to
be
see
,
two
still
figure
,
he
screech
out
as
if
he
would
be
a
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
yet
he
would
<EOS>
other
child
<EOS>
and
I
would
none
.
 
<EOS>
there
lie
my
darling
,
my
only
one
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
dead
,
and
there
be
no
one
to
love
me
,
no
,
not
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
disremember
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
rightly
what
I
do
;
but
I
know
I
be
very
quiet
,
while
my
heart
be
crush
within
me
.
     
<EOS>
"
Jennings
could
na
'
stand
be
in
the
room
at
all
,
so
the
landlady
take
him
down
,
and
I
be
glad
to
be
alone
.
 
<EOS>
It
grow
dark
while
I
sit
there
;
and
at
last
th
'
landlady
come
up
again
,
and
say
,
"
come
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
I
get
up
,
and
walk
into
the
light
,
but
I
have
to
hold
by
th
'
stair
-
rail
<EOS>
,
I
be
so
weak
and
dizzy
.
 
<EOS>
She
lead
me
into
a
room
,
where
Jennings
lie
on
a
sofa
fast
asleep
,
wi
'
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
over
his
head
for
a
night
-
cap
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
he
would
cry
himself
fairly
off
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
tea
on
th
'
table
all
ready
;
for
she
be
a
kind
-
hearted
body
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
still
say
,
"
come
here
,
"
and
take
hold
o
'
my
arm
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
go
round
the
table
,
and
there
be
a
clothe
-
basket
by
th
'
fire
,
wi
'
a
shawl
put
<EOS>
o'er
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
lift
that
up
,
"
say
she
,
and
I
do
;
and
there
lie
a
little
wee
babby
fast
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
give
a
leap
,
and
th
'
tear
come
rush
into
my
eye
first
time
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
"
be
it
hers
?
"
say
I
,
though
I
know
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
"
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
get
a
bit
better
<EOS>
o
'
the
fever
,
and
th
'
<EOS>
babby
be
bear
;
and
then
the
poor
young
man
take
worse
and
die
,
and
she
be
not
many
hour
behind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
little
mite
of
a
thing
!
<EOS>
and
yet
it
seem
her
angel
come
back
to
comfort
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
quite
jealous
<EOS>
o
'
Jennings
<EOS>
whenever
he
go
near
the
babby
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
more
my
flesh
and
blood
than
his'n
,
and
yet
I
be
afraid
he
would
claim
it
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
that
be
far
enough
fra
'
his
thought
;
he
would
plenty
other
childer
,
and
,
as
I
find
out
after
,
he
would
all
along
be
wish
me
to
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
we
bury
Margaret
and
her
husband
in
a
big
,
crowded
,
lonely
churchyard
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
loath
to
leave
them
there
,
as
I
think
,
<EOS>
when
they
rise
again
,
they
would
feel
so
strange
at
first
away
fra
'
Manchester
,
and
all
old
friend
;
but
it
could
na
be
help
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
God
watch
o'er
their
grave
there
as
well
as
here
.
 
<EOS>
that
funeral
cost
a
mint
o
'
money
,
but
Jennings
and
I
wish
to
do
th
'
thing
decent
.
 
<EOS>
then
we
would
the
stout
little
babby
to
bring
home
.
 
<EOS>
We
would
not
overmuch
money
leave
;
but
it
be
fine
weather
,
and
we
think
we
would
take
th
'
coach
to
Brummagem
,
and
walk
on
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
bright
May
morning
when
I
last
see
London
town
,
look
back
from
a
big
hill
a
mile
or
two
off
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
that
big
mass
o
'
a
place
I
be
leave
my
blessed
child
asleep
 
in
her
last
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
God
's
will
be
do
!
<EOS>
She
be
get
to
heaven
afore
me
;
but
I
shall
get
there
at
last
,
please
God
,
though
it
be
a
long
while
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
babby
have
be
feed
afore
we
set
out
,
and
th
'
coach
moving
keep
it
asleep
,
bless
its
little
heart
!
 
<EOS>
but
when
th
'
coach
stop
for
dinner
it
be
awake
,
and
cry
for
its
pobbie
.
<EOS>
*
 
<EOS>
so
we
ask
for
some
bread
and
milk
,
and
Jennings
take
it
first
for
to
feed
it
,
but
it
make
its
mouth
like
a
square
,
and
let
it
run
out
at
each
o
'
the
four
corner
.
 
<EOS>
"
shake
it
,
Jennings
,
"
say
I
;
"
that
be
the
way
they
make
water
run
through
a
funnel
,
when
it
be
o'er
full
;
and
a
child
's
mouth
be
broad
end
<EOS>
o
'
th
'
funnel
,
and
th
'
gullet
the
narrow

"
<EOS>
so
he
shake
it
,
but
it
only
cry
th
'
more
.
 
<EOS>
"
let
me
have
it
,
"
say
I
,
think
he
be
an
awkward
oud
chap
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
just
as
bad
<EOS>
wi
'
me
.
 
<EOS>
by
shake
th
'
babby
we
get
well
nor
a
gill
into
its
mouth
,
but
more
nor
that
come
up
again
,
wet
a
'
th
'
nice
dry

have
put
on
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
just
as
we
would
get
to
th
'
dinner
-
table
,
and
help
oursel
,
and
eaten
two
mouthful
,
come
in
th

guard
,
and
a
fine

wi

a
sample
of
calico
flourishing
in
his

.
 
<EOS>
"
Coach

"
<EOS>
say
one
;
"
half
-
a
-
crown

dinner

"
say
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
we
think
it
a
deal
for
both
our
dinner
,
when
we
would
hardly
taste
'em
;
but
,
bless
your
life
,
it
be
half
-
a
-
crown
apiece
,
and
a
shilling
for
th
'
bread
and
milk
as
be
possette
all
over
babby
's
clothe
.
 
<EOS>
We
speak
up
again
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
it
<EOS>
;
but
everybody
say
it
be
the
rule
,
so
what
could
two
poor
oud
chap
like
us
do
again
it
?
<EOS>
well
,
poor
babby
cry
without
stop
to
take
breath
,
fra
'
<EOS>
that
time
till
we
get
to
Brummagem
for
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
ache
for
th
'
little
thing
.
 
<EOS>
It
catch
wi
'
its
wee
mouth
at
our
coat
sleeve
and
at
our
mouth
,
when
we
try
t
'
comfort
it
by
talk
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
poor
little
wench
!
<EOS>
it
want
its
mammy
,
as
be
lie
cold
in
th
'
grave
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
"
say
I
,
"
it
will
be
clem
to
death
,
if
it
let
out
its
supper
as
it
do
its
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
let
's
get
some
woman
to
feed
it
;
it
come
natural
to
woman
to
do
for
babbie
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
we
ask
th
'
chambermaid
at
the
inn
,
and
she
take
quite
kindly
to
it
;
and
we
get
a
good
supper
,
and
grow
rare
and
sleepy
,
what
wi
'
th
'
warmth
and
wi
'
our
long
ride
i
'
the
open
air
.
 
<EOS>
th
'
chambermaid
say
she
would
like
t
'
have
it
t
'
sleep
wi
'
her
,
only
missis
would
scold
so
;
but
it
look
so
quiet
and
smile
like
,
as
it
lie
in
her
arm
,
that
we
think
'
t
would
be
no
trouble
to
have
it
<EOS>
wi
'
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
:
"
see
,
Jennings
<EOS>
,
how
woman
folk
do
quieten
babbie
;
it
be
just
as
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
He
look
grave
;
he
be
always
thoughtful
-
look
,
though
I
never
hear
him
say
anything
very
deep
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
say
he
   
"
"
young
woman
!
<EOS>
have
you
get
a
spare
nightcap
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
missis
always
keep
nightcap
for
gentleman
as
do
not
like
to
unpack
,
"
say
she
,
rather
quick
.
     
<EOS>
"
"
ay
,
but
young
woman
,
it
be
one
of
your
nightcap
I
want
.
 
<EOS>
th
'
babby
seem
to
have
take
a
mind
to
yo
;
and
maybe
in
th
'
dark
it
may
take
me
for
yo
if
I
would
getten
your
nightcap
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
chambermaid
smirk
and
go
for
a
cap
,
but
I
laugh
outright
at
th
'
oud
bearded
chap
think
he
would
make
hissel
like
a
woman
just
by
put
on
a
woman
's
cap
.
 
<EOS>
Howe'er
he
would
not
be
laugh
out
on't
,
so
I
hold
th
'
babby
till
he
be
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
night
as
we
have
on
it
!
 
<EOS>
Babby
begin
to
scream
o
'
th
'
oud
fashion
,
and
we
take
it
turn
and
turn
about
to
sit
up
and
rock
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
be
very
sore
for
the
little
one
,
as
it
grope
about
wi
'
its
mouth
;
but
for
a
'
that
I
could
scarce
keep
fra
'
smile
at
th
'
think
<EOS>
o
'
us
two
oud
chaps
,
th
'
one
wi
'
a
woman
's
nightcap
on
,
sit
on
our
hinder
end
for
half
the
night
,
hushabye
a
babby
as
would
not
be
hushabie
.
 
<EOS>
toward
morning
,
poor
little
wench
!
<EOS>
it
fall
asleep
,
fairly
tired
out
wi
'
cry
,
but
even
in
its
sleep
it
give
such
pitiful
sobs
,
quiver
up
fra
'
the
very
bottom
of
its
little
heart
,
that
once
or
twice
I
almost
wish
it
lie
on
its
mother
's
breast
,
at
peace
for
ever
.
<EOS>
jenning
fall
asleep
too
;
but
I
begin
for
to
reckon
up
our
money
.
<EOS>
It
be
little
enough
we
have
leave
,
our
dinner
<EOS>
the
day
afore
have
ta'en
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
our
reckoning
would
be
for
that
night
lodging
,
and
supper
,
and
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
do
a
sum
always
send
me
asleep
<EOS>
ever
sin
<EOS>
'
I
be
a
lad
;
so
I
fall
sound
in
a
short
time
,
and
be
only
waken
by
chambermaid
tap
at
th
'
door
,
to
say
she
would
dress
the
babby
before
her
missis
be
up
if
we
like
.
 
<EOS>
but
bless
yo
<EOS>
,
we
would
never
think
<EOS>
o
'
undress
it
the
night
afore
,
and
now
it
be
sleep
so
sound
,
and
we
be
so
glad
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
'
the
peace
and
quietness
,
that
we
think
it
be
no
good
to
waken
it
up
to
screech
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
(
there
be
Mary
asleep
for
a
good
listener
!
)
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
be
get
weary
of
my
tale
,
so
I
will
not
be
long
over
end
it
.
 
<EOS>
th
'
reckoning
leave
us
very
bare
,
and
we
think
we
would
best
walk
home
,
for
it
be
only
sixty
mile
,
they
tell
us
,
and
not
stop
again
for
nought
,
save
victual
.
 
<EOS>
so
we
leave
Brummagem
(
which
be
as
black
a
place
as
Manchester
,
without
look
so
like
home
)
,
and
walk
a
'
that
day
,
carry
babby
turn
and
turn
about
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
well
feed
by
<EOS>
chambermaid
afore
<EOS>
we
leave
,
and
th
'
day
be
fine
,
and
folk
begin
to
have
some
knowledge
o
'
th
'
proper
way
<EOS>
o
'
speaking
,
and
we
be
more
cheery
at
thought
<EOS>
o
'
home
(
though
mine
,
God
know
,
be
lonesome
enough
)
.
 
<EOS>
We
stop
none
for
dinner
,
but
at
baggin
-
time
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
we
getten
a
good
meal
at
a
public
-
house
,
an
'
fed
th
'
babby
as
well
as
we
could
,
but
that
be
but
poorly
.
 
<EOS>
We
get
a
crust
too
for
it
to
suck
 
chambermaid
put
us
up
to
that
.
 
<EOS>
that
night
,
whether
we
be
tired
or
whatten
,
I
do
not
know
,
but
it
be
dree
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
*
work
,
and
th
'
poor
little
wench
have
sleep
out
her
sleep
,
and
begin
th
'
cry
as
wear
my
heart
out
again
.
 
<EOS>
say
Jennings
,
say
<EOS>
he
   
<EOS>
"
"
We
should
na
ha
'
set
out
<EOS>
so
like
gentlefolk
<EOS>
a
top
o
'
the
coach
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
"
Nay
,
lad
!
 
<EOS>
We
should
ha
'
have
more
to
walk
if
we
have
na
ride
,
and
I
be
sure
both
you
and
i'se
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
weary
o
'
tramping
.
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
so
he
be
quiet
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
<EOS>
one
o
'
<EOS>
them
as
be
sure
to
find
out
somewhat
<EOS>
have
be
do
amiss
when
there
be
no
go
back
to
undo
it
.
 
<EOS>
so
presently
he
cough
,
as
if
he
be
go
to
speak
,
and
I
say
to
myself
,
"
at
it
again
,
my
lad
.
"
 
<EOS>
say
<EOS>
he
   
"
<EOS>
"
I
ax
pardon
,
neighbour
,
but
<EOS>
it
strike
me
it
would
ha
'
be
well
for
my
son
if
he
have
never
begin
to
keep
company
wi
'
your
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
that
put
me
up
,
and
my
heart
get
very
full
,
and
but
that
I
be
carry
her
babby
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
should
ha
'
strike
him
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
I
could
hold
in
no
longer
,
and
say
<EOS>
I
   
"
"
Better
say
at
once
it
would
ha
'
be
well
for
God
never
to
ha
'
make
th
'
world
,
for
then
we
would
never
ha
'
be
in
it
,
to
have
have
th
'
heavy
heart
we
have
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
he
say
that
be
rank
blasphemy
;
but
I
think
his
way
of
cast
up
again
th
'
event
God
have
please
to
send
,
be
bad
blasphemy
.
 
<EOS>
Howe'er
,
I
say
nought
more
angry
,
for
th
'
little
babby
's
sake
,
as
be
th
'
child
o
'
<EOS>
his
dead
son
,
as
well
as
o
'
my
dead
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
th
'
long
lane
will
have
a
turning
,
and
that
night
come
to
an
end
at
last
;
and
we
be
footsore
and
tired
enough
,
and
to
my
mind
the
babby
be
get
weak
and
weak
,
and
it
wring
my
heart
to
hear
its
little
wail
!
 
<EOS>
I
would
ha
'
give
my
right
hand
for
one
of
yesterday
's
hearty
cry
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
want
our
breakfast
,
and
so
be
it
too
,
motherless
babby
!
 
<EOS>
We
could
see
no
public
-
house
,
so
about
six
o'clock
(
only
we
think
it
be
later
)
<EOS>
we
stop
at
a
cottage
,
where
a
woman
be
move
about
near
th
'
open
door
.
 
<EOS>
say
I
,
"
good
woman
,
may
we
rest
us
a
bit
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
come
in
,
"
say
she
,
wipe
a
chair
,
as
look
bright
enough
afore
,
wi
'
her
apron
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
cheery
,
clean
room
;
and
we
be
glad
to
sit
down
again
,
though
I
think
my
leg
would
never
bend
at
th
'
knee
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
minute
she
fall
a
noticing
th
'
babby
,
and
take
it
in
her
arm
,
and
kiss
it
again
and
again
.
<EOS>
"
missis
,
"
say
I
,
"
we
be
not
without
money
and
if
yo'd
give
us
somewhat
for
breakfast
,
we
would
pay
yo
honest
,
and
if
yo
would
wash
and
dress
that
poor
babby
,
and
get
some
pobbie
down
its
throat
,
for
it
be
well
-
nigh
clem
<EOS>
,
I
would
pray
for
you
till
my
die
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
she
say
nought
but
give
me
th
'
babby
back
,
and
afore
you
could
say
Jack
Robinson
,
she
would
a
pan
on
th
'
fire
,
and
bread
and
cheese
on
th
'
table
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
turn
round
,
her
face
look
red
,
and
her
lip
be
tight
press
together
.
 
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
we
be
right
down
glad
on
our
breakfast
,
and
God
bless
and
reward
that
woman
for
her
kindness
that
day
!
 
<EOS>
She
feed
th
'
poor
babby
as
gently
and
softly
,
and
speak
to
it
as
tenderly
as
its
own
poor
mother
could
ha
'
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
that
stranger
and
it
have
know
each
other
afore
,
maybe
in
heaven
,
where
folk
's
spirit
come
from
,
they
say
;
th
'
babby
look
up
so
lovingly
in
her
eye
,
and
make
little
noise
more
like
a
dove
than
aught
else
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
undress
it
(
poor
darling
!
<EOS>
it
be
time
)
,
touch
it
so
softly
;
and
wash
it
from
head
to
foot
;
and
as
many
on
its
clothe
be
dirty
,
and
what
bit
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
thing
its
mother
have
get
ready
for
it
have
be
send
by
th
'
carrier
fra
'
London
<EOS>
,
she
put
'em
aside
;
and
wrap
little
naked
babby
in
her
apron
,
she
pull
out
a
key
,
as
be
fasten
to
a
black
ribbon
,
and
hang
down
her
breast
,
and
unlock
a
drawer
in
th
'
dresser
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
to
be
pry
,
but
I
could
na
help
see
in
that
drawer
some
little
child
's
clothe
,
all
strew
wi
'
lavender
,
and
lie
by
'em
a
little
whip
an
'
a
broken
rattle
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
have
an
insight
into
that
woman
's
heart
then
.
 
<EOS>
She
take
out
a
thing
or
two
and
lock
the
drawer
,
and
go
on
dress
babby
.
 
<EOS>
just
about
then
come
her
husband
down
,
a
great
big
fellow
as
do
not
look
half
awake
,
though
it
be
get
late
;
but
he
would
hear
all
as
have
be
say
downstairs
,
as
be
plain
to
be
see
;
but
he
be
a
gruff
chap
.
<EOS>
We
would
finish
our
breakfast
,
and
Jennings
be
look
hard
at
th

woman
as
she
be
get
the
babby
to

<EOS>
at

enough

have
go
to
th

and
stand
there
,
whistle
wi
'
his
hand
in
his
breech
-
pocket
,
look
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
but
at
last
he
turn
and
say
,
quite
sharp
   
"
"
I
say
,
<EOS>
missis
,
I
be
to
have
no
breakfast
to

day
,
I

<EOS>
"
  
"
so
wi
'
that
she
kiss
th
'
child
,
a
long
,
soft
kiss
,
and
look
in
my
face
to
see
if
I
could
take
her
meaning
,
give
me
th
'
babby
without
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
loath
to
stir
,
but
I
see
it
be
well
to
go
.
 
<EOS>
so
give
Jennings
a
sharp
nudge
(
for
he
would
fall
asleep
)
,
I
say
,
"
Missis
,
what
be
to
pay
?
<EOS>
"
pull
out
my
money
wi
'
a
jingle
that
she
may
na
guess
we
be
at
all
bare
o
'
cash
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
look
at
her
husband
,
who
say
ne'er
a
word
,
but
be
listen
with
all
his
ear
nevertheless
;
and
when
she
see
he
would
na
say
,
she
say
,
hesitate
,
as
if
 
pull
two
way
,
by
her
fear
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
'
him
,
"
Should
you
think
sixpence
over
much
?
"
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
different
to
public
-
house
reckoning
,
for
we
would
eaten
a
main
deal
<EOS>
afore
the
chap
come
down
.
 
<EOS>
so
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
and
,
missis
,
what
should
we
gi
'
<EOS>
you
for
the
babby

bread
and
milk

"
 
<EOS>
(
I
have
it
once
in
my
mind
to
say
"
and
for
a
'
your
trouble
with
it
,
"
but
my
heart
would
na
let
me
say
it
,
for
I
could
read
in
her
way
how
it
have
be
a
work
o

love

.
 
<EOS>
so
say
she
,
quite
quick
,
and
steal
a
look
at
her
husband
's
back
,
as
look
all
<EOS>
ear
,
if
ever
a
back
do
,
"
oh
,
we
could
take
nought
for
the
little

food

if

twice
as
much

bless
it

"
 
<EOS>
Wi
'
that
he
look
at
her
;
such
a
scowling
look
!
 
<EOS>
She
know
what
he
mean
,
and
step
softly
across
the
floor
to
him
,
and
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
He
seem'd
<EOS>
as
though
he
would
shake
it
off
by
a
jerk
on
his
elbow
,
but
she
say
quite
low
,
"
for
poor
little
Johnnie
's
sake
,
Richard
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
move
or
speak
again
,
and
after
look
in
his
face
for
a
minute
,
she
turn
away
,
swallow
deep
in
her
throat
.
<EOS>
She
kiss
th
'
sleep
babby
as
she
pass
,
when
I
pay
her
.
 
<EOS>
to
quieten
th
'
gruff
husband
,
and
stop
him
if
he
rate
her
,
I
could
na
help
slip
another
sixpence
under
th
'
loaf
,
and
then
we
set
off
again
.
 
<EOS>
last
look
<EOS>
I
have
o
'
that
woman
she
be
quietly
wipe
her
eye
wi

the
corner
of
her
apron
,
as
she
go
about
her
husband
's
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
shall
know
her
in

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
stop
to
think
of
that
long
ago
May
morning
,
when
he
have
carry
his
grand
-
daughter
under
the
distant
hedgerow
and
beneath
the
flowering
sycamore
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
nought
more
to
say

wench
,
"
say
he
to
Margaret
,
as
she
beg
him
to
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
that
night
we
reach
Manchester
,
and
I
would
find
out
that
Jennings
would
be
glad
enough
to
give
up
babby
to
me
,
so
I
take
her
home
at
once
,
and
a
blessing
she
be
be
to
me

"
  
<EOS>
They
be
all
silent
for
a
few
minute
;
each
follow
out
the
current
of
their
thought
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
almost
simultaneously
,
their
attention
fall
upon
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
sit
on
her
little
stool
,
her
head
rest
on
her
father
's
knee
,
and
sleep
as
soundly
as
any
infant
,
her
breath
(
still
like
an
infant

come
and
go
as
softly
as
a
bird
steal
to
her
leafy
nest
.
 
<EOS>
Her
half
-
open
mouth
be
as
scarlet
as
the
winter

berry
,
and
contrast
finely
with
the
clear
paleness
of
her
complexion
,
where
the
eloquent
blood
flush
carnation
at
each
motion
.
 
<EOS>
Her
black
eye

lash
lie
on
the
delicate
cheek
,
which
be
still
more
shade
by
the
masse
of
her
golden
hair

<EOS>
that
seem
to
form
a
nest

like
pillar
for
her
as
she
lie

<EOS>
Her
father
in
fond
pride
straighten
one
glossy
curl
,
for
an
instant
,
as
if
to
display
its
length
and
silkiness

the
little
action
awake
her

and
,
like

even
her

could
not

outright

so
adjust
his

cock

cross

<EOS>
but
the
rent
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
half
-
a
-
crown
a
week
 
<EOS>
nearly
all
Mary
's
earning
 
and
much
less
room
may
do
for
them
,
only
two
.
 
<EOS>
(
now
come
the
time
to
be
thankful
that
the
early
dead
be
save
from
the
evil
to
come
.
)
 
<EOS>
the
agricultural
labourer
generally
have
strong
local
attachment
;
but
they
be
far
less
common
,
almost
obliterate
,
among
the
inhabitant
of
a
town
.
 
<EOS>
still
there
be
exception
,
and
Barton
form
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
remove
to
his
present
house
just
after
the
last
bad
time
,
when
little
Tom
have
sicken
and
die
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
then
think
the
bustle
of
a
removal
would
give
his
poor
stunned
wife
something
to
do
,
and
he
have
take
more
interest
in
the
detail
of
the
proceeding
than
he
otherwise
would
have
do
,
in
the
hope
of
call
her
forth
to
action
again
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
seem
to
know
every
brass
-
head
nail
drive
up
for
her
convenience
.
 
<EOS>
only
one
have
be
displace
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Esther
's
bonnet
nail
,
which
in
his
deep
revengeful
anger
against
her
,
after
his
wife
's
death
,
he
have
tear
out
of
the
wall
,
and
cast
into
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
hard
work
to
leave
the
house
,
which
yet
seem
hallowed
by
his
wife
's
presence
in
the
happy
day
of
old
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
be
a
law
unto
himself
,
though
sometimes
a
bad
,
fierce
law
;
and
he
resolve
to
give
the
rent
-
collector
notice
,
and
look
out
for
a
cheap
abode
,
and
tell
Mary
they
must
flit
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Mary
!
<EOS>
she
love
the
house
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
wrench
up
her
natural
feeling
of
home
,
for
it
would
be
long
before
the
fibre
of
her
heart
would
gather
themselves
about
another
place
.
  
<EOS>
this
trial
be
spare
.
 
<EOS>
the
collector
(
of
himself
)
,
on
the
very
Monday
when
Barton
plan
to
give
him
notice
of
his
intention
to
leave
,
lower
the
rent
threepence
a
week
,
just
enough
to
make
Barton
compromise
and
agree
to
stay
on
a
little
long
.
  
<EOS>
but
by
degree
the
house
be
strip
of
all
its
little
ornament
.
<EOS>
some
be
break
;
and
the
odd
twopence
and
threepence
,
want
to
pay
for
their
repair
,
be
require
for
the
far
sterner
necessity
of
food
.
 
<EOS>
and
by
-
and
-
bye
Mary
begin
to
part
with
other
superfluity
at
the
pawn
-
shop
.
 
<EOS>
the
smart
tea
-
tray
and
tea
-
caddy
,
long
and
carefully
keep
,
go
for
bread
for
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
ask
for
it
,
or
complain
,
but
she
see
hunger
in
his
shrunk
,
fierce
,
animal
look
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
blanket
go
,
for
it
be
summer
time
,
and
they
could
spare
them
;
and
their
sale
make
a
fund
,
which
Mary
fancy
would
last
till
well
time
come
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
soon
all
go
;
and
then
she
look
around
the
room
to
crib
it
of
its
few
remain
ornament
.
 
<EOS>
to
all
these
proceeding
her
father
say
never
a
word
.
<EOS>
if
he
fast
,
or
feast
(
after
the
sale
of
some
article
)
on
an
unusual
meal
of
bread
and
cheese
,
he
take
all
with
a
sullen
indifference
,
which
depress
Mary
's
heart
.
 
<EOS>
She
often
wish
he
would
apply
for
relief
from
the
Guardians
'
relieve
office
;
often
wonder
the
Trades
'
Union
do
nothing
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
once
,
when
she
ask
him
as
he
sit
,
grime
,
unshaven
,
and
gaunt
,
after
a
day
's
fasting
,
over
the
fire
,
why
he
do
not
get
relief
from
the
town
,
he
turn
round
,
with
grim
wrath
,
and
say
,
"
I
do
not
want
money
,
child
!
<EOS>
D####n
<EOS>
their
charity
and
their
money

<EOS>
I
want
work
,
and
it
be
my
right

<EOS>
I
want
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
would
bear
it
all
,
he
say
to
himself
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
do
bear
it
,
but
not
meekly
;
that
be
too
much
to
expect
.
 
<EOS>
real
meekness
of
character
be
call
out
by
experience
of
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
and
few
have
be
kind
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
yet
through
it
all
,
with
stern
determination
he
refuse
the
assistance
his
Trades
'
Union
would
have
give
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
not
much
to
give
,
but
,
with
worldly
wisdom
,
think
it
better
to
propitiate
an
active
,
useful
member
,
than
to
help
those
who
be
more
unenergetic
,
though
they
have
large
family
to
provide
for
.
 
<EOS>
not
so
think
John
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
with
him
,
need
be
right
.
  
<EOS>
"
give
it
to
Tom
Darbyshire
,
"
he
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
more
claim
on
it
than
me
,
for
he
be
more
need
of
it
,
with
his
seven
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
now
Tom
Darbyshire
be
,
in
his
listless
,
grumble
way
,
a
back
-
bite
enemy
of
John
Barton
's
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
know
it
;
but
he
be
not
to
be
influence
by
that
in
a
matter
like
this
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
go
early
to
her
work
;
but
her
cheery
laugh
over
it
be
now
miss
by
the
other
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mind
wander
over
the
present
distress
,
and
then
settle
,
as
she
stitch
,
on
the
vision
of
the
future
,
where
yet
her
thought
dwelt
more
on
the
circumstance
of
ease
,
and
the
pomp
and
vanity
await
her
,
than
on
the
lover
with
whom
she
be
to
share
them
.
 
<EOS>
still
she
be
not
insensible
to
the
pride
of
have
attract
one
so
far
above
herself
in
station
;
not
insensible
to
the
secret
pleasure
of
know
that
he
,
whom
so
many
admired
,
have
often
say
he
would
give
anything
for
one
of
her
sweet
smile
.
 
<EOS>
Her
love
for
him
be
a
bubble
,
blow
out
of
vanity
;
but
it
look
very
real
and
very
bright
.
 
<EOS>
Sally
Leadbitter
,
meanwhile
,
keenly
observe
the
sign
of
the
time
;
she
find
out
that
Mary
have
begin
to
affix
a
stern
value
to
money
as
the
"
Purchaser
of
Life
,
"
and
many
girl
have
be
dazzle
and
lure
by
gold
,
even
without
the
betraying
love
which
she
believe
to
exist
in
Mary
's
heart
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
urge
young
Mr.
Carson
,
by
representation
of
the
want
she
be
sure
surround
Mary
,
to
bring
matter
more
to
a
point
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
a
kind
of
instinctive
dread
of
hurt
Mary
's
pride
of
spirit
,
and
durst
not
hint
his
knowledge
in
any
way
of
the
distress
that
many
must
be
endure
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
that
for
the
present
he
must
still
be
content
with
steal
meeting
and
summer
evening
stroll
,
and
the
delight
of
pour
sweet
honeyed
word
into
her
ear
,
while
she
listen
with
a
blush
and
a
smile
that
make
her
look
radiant
with
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
no
;
he
would
be
cautious
in
order
to
be
certain
;
for
Mary
,
one
way
or
another
,
he
must
make
his
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
doubt
of
the
effect
of
his
own
personal
charm
in
the
long
run
;
for
he
know
he
be
handsome
,
and
believe
himself
fascinating
.
  
<EOS>
if
he
have
know
what
Mary

home
be

he
would
not
have
be
so
much
convinced
of
his
increase
influence
over
her
,
by
her
be
more
and
more
ready
to
linger
with
him
in
the
sweet
summer
air
.
 
<EOS>
for
when
she
return
for
the
night
her
father
be
often
out
,
and
the
house
want
the
cheerful
look
it
have
have
in
the
day
when
money
be
never
want
to
purchase
soap
and
brush
,
black
-
lead
and
pipe
-
clay
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
dingy
and
comfortless
;
for
,
of
course
,
there
be
not
even
the
dumb
familiar
home
-
friend
,
a
fire
.
 
<EOS>
and
Margaret
,
too
,
be
now
very
often
from
home
,
singe
at
some
of
those
grand
place
.
 
<EOS>
and
Alice
<EOS>
;
oh
,
Mary
wish
she
have
never
leave
her
cellar
to
go
and
live
at
ancoat
with
her
sister
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
for
in
that
matter
Mary
feel
very
guilty
;
she
have
put
off
and
put
off
go
to
see
the
widow
,
after
George
Wilson
's
death
,
from
dread
of
meet
Jem
,
or
give
him
reason
to
think
she
wish
to
be
as
intimate
with
him
as
formerly
;
and
now
she
be
so
much
ashamed
of
her
delay
that
she
be
likely
never
to
go
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
if
her
father
be
at
home
it
be
no
better
;
indeed
,
it
be
bad
.
<EOS>
He
seldom
speak
,
less
than
ever
;
and
often
when
he
do
speak
,
they
be
sharp
angry
word
,
such
as
he
have
never
give
her
formerly
.
<EOS>
Her
temper
be
high
,
too
,
and
her
answer
not
over
mild
;
and
once
in
his
passion
he
have
even
beat
her
.
 
<EOS>
if
Sally
Leadbitter
or
Mr.
Carson
have
be
at
hand
at
that
moment
,
Mary
would
have
be
ready
to
leave
home
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
She
sit
alone
,
after
her
father
have
fling
out
of
the
house
,
bitterly
think
on
the
day
that
be
go
;
angry
with
her
own
hastiness
,
and
believe
that
her
father
do
not
love
her
;
strive
to
heap
up
one
painful
thought
on
another
.
 
<EOS>
who
care
for
her
?
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
may
,
but
in
this
grief
that
seem
no
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
Mother
dead
!
 
<EOS>
Father
so
often
angry
,
so
lately
cruel
(
for
it
be
a
hard
blow
,
and
blister
and
redden
Mary
's
soft
white
skin
with
pain
)
:
<EOS>
and
then
her
heart
turn
round
,
and
she
remember
with
self
-
reproach
how
provokingly
she
have
look
and
speak
,
and
how
much
her
father
have
to
bear
;
and
oh
,
what
a
kind
and
loving
parent
he
have
be
,
till
these
day
of
trial
.
 
<EOS>
the
remembrance
of
one
little
instance
of
his
fatherly
love
throng
after
another
into
her
mind
,
and
she
begin
to
wonder
how
she
could
have
behave
to
him
as
she
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
then
he
come
home
;
and
but
for
very
shame
she
would
have
confess
her
penitence
in
word
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
look
sullen
,
from
her
effort
to
keep
down
emotion
;
and
for
some
time
her
father
do
not
know
how
to
begin
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
he
gulp
down
pride
,
and
say
   
"
<EOS>
Mary
,
I
be
not
above
say
I
be
very
sorry
<EOS>
I
beat
thee
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
wert
a
bit
aggravate
,
and
I
be
not
the
man
I
be

<EOS>
but
it
be
wrong
,
and
I
will
try
never
to
lay
hand
on
thee
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
he
hold
out
his
arm
,
and
in
many
tear
she
tell
him
her
repentance
for
her
fault
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
strike
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
still
,
he
often
be
angry
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
be
almost
well
than
be
silent
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
sit
near
the
fireplace
(
from
habit
)
smoking
,
or
chew
opium
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
how
Mary
loathe
that
smell
!
 
<EOS>
and
in
the
dusk
,
just
before
it
merge
into
the
short
summer
night
,
she
have
learn
to
look
with
dread
towards
the
window
,
which
now
her
father
would
have
keep
uncurtaine
:
for
there
be
not
seldom
see
sight
which
haunt
her
in
her
dream
.
 
<EOS>
strange
face
of
pale
man
,
with
dark
glaring
eye
,
peer
into
the
inner
darkness
,
and
seem
desirous
to
ascertain
if
her
father
be
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
or
,
a
hand
and
arm
<EOS>
(
the
body

be
put
within
the
door

and
beckon
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
always
go

<EOS>
and
once
or
twice
,
when
Mary
be
in
bed
,
she
hear
man

voice
below
,
in
earnest
,
whisper
talk

<EOS>
They
be
all
desperate
member
of
Trades

ready

<EOS>
while
all
this
change
for
gloom
yet
strike
fresh
and
heavy
on
Mary
's
heart
,
her
father
startle
her
out
of
a
reverie
one
evening
,
by
ask
her
when
she
have
be

see
Jane
Wilson

<EOS>
from
his
manner
of
speak
,
she
be
make
aware
that
he
have
be
;
but
at
the
time
of
his
visit
he
have
never
mention
anything
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
he
gruffly
tell
her
to
go
next
day
without
fail
,
and
add
some
abuse
of
her
for

<EOS>
the
little
outward
impulse
of
her
father
's
speech
give
Mary
the
push
which
she
in
this
instance
require
;
and
accordingly
,
time
her
visit
so
as
to
avoid
Jem

follow
afternoon

<EOS>
the

the

They

Mary
feel
guilty

for

silent

look

then
turn
to

she

there
never

I
have

the

they
be
boil

know'd

off

all

so
I
tidy
my
house
in

rough

I
look
at

clock
up
yonder

point
at
one
that
hang
against

and
I
seed
it
be
nine
o'clock

so
<EOS>
,
think
I
,
th

potato
shall
be
well
boil
at
any
rate

I
get
'em
on
th

fire
in
a
jiffy

that

I
could

then
I
fall
to
unpack

at
twenty

twelve

he
come
home

I
have
the
beef
ready
on

I
go

<EOS>
Mary

th

boil
away

He

Mary

I

Alice

who

near

of

it

evident

the

it

I

it
be
Prince

ought
to
be
ask
how
he
would
like
his

to
be
from
home
when
he
come
in

tired
and
worn
,
and
want
some
one
to
cheer
him

and
maybe
,
her
to
come
in
by
-
and
-
bye
,
just
as
tired
and
down
in
th
'
mouth
;
and
how
he
would
like
for
her
never
to
be
at
home
to
see
to
th
'
cleaning
of
his
house
,
or
to
keep
a
bright
fire
in
his
grate

<EOS>
let
alone
his
meal
be
all
hugger

mugger

comfortless

I
would
be
bind
,
prince
as
he
be

if
his
missis
serve
him
so

he
would
be
off
to
a
gin

palace

summut

that
kind

<EOS>
so
why
can
not
he
make
a
law
again
poor
folk

wife
work
in
factory

<EOS>
Mary
venture
to
say
that
she
think
the
Queen
and
Prince
Albert
could
not
make
law
,
but
the
answer
be
   
"
pooh
!
<EOS>
do
not
tell
me
it
be
not
the
Queen
as
make
law
;
and
be
not
she
bind
to
obey
Prince

and
if
he
say
they
must
not

why
she
would
say
they
must
not

then
all

Mary
go
very
red
,
and
look
annoyed

although
there
be
a
secret
spring
of
joy
deep
down
in
her
heart
,
at
hear
Jem
so
spoken
of

his
mother
only
see
the
annoyed
look

be
pique
accordingly

<EOS>
She
be
not
over
and
above
desirous
that
her
son
should
marry
.
 
<EOS>
His
presence
in
the
house
seem
a
relic
of
happy
time
,
and
she
have
some
little
jealousy
of
his
future
wife
,
whoever
she
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
still
she
could
not
bear
any
one
not
to
feel
gratified
and
flatter
by
Jem
's
preference
,
and
<EOS>
full
well
she
know
how
above
all
other
he
prefer
Mary

<EOS>
now
she
have
never
think
Mary
good
enough
for
Jem
,
and
her
late
neglect
in
come
to
see
her
still
rankle
a
little
in
her
breast
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
determine
to
invent
a
little
,
in
order
to
do
away
with
any
idea
Mary
may
have
that
Jem
would
choose
her
for

his
right

call
it

"
ay

he
will
be
for
take
a

soon

and
then
,
in
a
low
voice
,
as
if
confidentially
,
but
really
to
prevent
any
contradiction
or
explanation
from
her
simple
sister
-
in

law

she
add
   
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
be
long
afore
Molly
Gibson
(
that

her
at

provision
shop
round

will
hear
a
secret
as
will
not

be
think

<EOS>
She
be
be
cast
sheep
's
eye
at
our

this
many
a
day

he
think
her
father
would
not
give
her
to
a
common
working

now
he
be
good
as
her

every

by
an
effort
Mary
manage
to
keep
down
her
vexation

to
say
,
"
She
hope

would
be
happy

be
glad
she
be
go
out
of
the
room

Her
word
irritate
her
;
perhaps
not
the
less
because
she
do
not
fully
believe
them
.
<EOS>
besides
,
she
want
to
speak
to
Alice
,
and
Mrs.
Wilson
seem
to
think
that
she
,
as
the
widow

ought
to
absorb
all
the
attention

dear
Alice
,

begin
Mary

be

grieved

you
so
deaf

it
must
have
come
on
very
rapid
.

<EOS>
"
yes
,
dear

it
be
a
trial

I
will
not
deny
it

Pray
God
give
me
strength
to
find
out
its
teaching

I
feel
it
sore
one
fine
day
when
I
think
I
would
go
gather
some
meadow
-
sweet
to
make
tea
for
Jane
's
cough
;
and
the
field
seem
so
dree
and
still
,
and
at
first
I
could
na
make
out
what
be
want
;
and
then
it
strike
me
it
be
th
'
song
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
the
bird
,
and
that
I
never
should
hear
their
sweet
music
no
more
,
and
I
could
na
help
cry
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
much
to
be
thankful
for
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
be
a
comfort
to
Jane
,
if
I
be
only
some
one
to
scold
now
and
then
;
poor
body
!
 
<EOS>
It
take
off
her
thought
from
her
sore
loss
when
she
can
scold
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
if
my
eye
be
leave
I
can
do
well
enough
;
I
can
guess
at
what

be

"
  
<EOS>
the
splendid
red
and
yellow
patch
quilt
now
make
its
appearance
,
and
Jane
Wilson
would
not
be
satisfied
unless
Mary
praise
it
all
over
,
border
,
centre
,
and
ground
-
work
,
right
side
and
wrong
;
and
Mary
do
her
duty
,
say
all
the
more
,
because
she
could
not
work
herself
up
to
any
very
hearty
admiration
of
her
rival
's
present
.

She
make
haste

however

with
her
commendation

in
order
to

<EOS>
do
Jem
really
care
for
Molly
Gibson
?
 
<EOS>
well
,
if
he

People
seem
all
to
think
he
be
much
too
good
for
her
<EOS>
(
Mary
's
own
self
)
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
some
one
else
,
far
more
handsome
,
and
far
more
grand
,
would
show
him
one
day
that
she
be
good
enough
to

He

and
fiercely

heavily
do
the

towards
eleven
o'clock
,
some
irritate
by
the
opposition
of
other
to
their
desperate
plan
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
a

to
cheer
them
,
as
they
quit
the
glare
of

<EOS>
He

when
he

but
he
do
not

He

even
by
the
darkness
visible
of
that
badly

light
street
,
that
the
woman
who
stand
by
him
be
of
no
doubtful
profession
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
tell
by
her
fade
finery
,
all
unfit
to
meet
the
pelting
of
that
pitiless
storm
;
the
gauze
bonnet
,
once
pink
,
now
dirty
white
;
the
muslin
gown
,

coloured

<EOS>
"
I

He

She
put
her

to
her
side

He

and
in
her
large

unnaturally
bright
grey
eye

her
lovely

half
open

as

He

<EOS>
Barton
return
home
after
his
encounter
with
Esther
,
uneasy
 
and
dissatisfied
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
say
no
more
than
he
have
be
plan
to
say
for
year
,
in
case
she
be
ever
throw
in
his
way
,
in
the
character
in
which
he
feel
certain
he
should
meet
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
believe
she
deserve
it
all
,
and
yet
he
now
wish
he
have
not
say
it
.
 
<EOS>
Her
look
,
as
she
ask
for
mercy
,
haunt
him
through
his
broken
and
disorder
sleep
;
her
form
,
as
he
last
see
her
,
lie
prostrate
in
helplessness
,
would
not
be
banish
from
his
dream
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
up
in
bed
to
try
and
dispel
the
vision
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
too
late
,
his
conscience
smote
him
with
harshness
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
all
very
well
<EOS>
,
he
think
,
to
have
say
what
he
do
,
if
he
have
add
some
kind
word
,
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
He
wonder
if
his
dead
wife
be
conscious
of
that
night
's
occurrence
;
and
he
hope
not
,
for
with
her
love
for
Esther
he
believe
it
would
embitter
heaven
to
have
see
her
so
degraded
and
repulse
.
 
<EOS>
for
he
now
recall
her
humility
,
her
tacit
acknowledgment
of
her
lose
character
;
and
he
begin
to
marvel
if
there
be
power
in
the
religion
he
have
often
hear
of
,
to
turn
her
from
her
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
that
no
earthly
power
that
he
know
of
could
do
it
,
but
there
glimmer
on
his
darkness
the
idea
that
religion
may
save
her
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
where
to
find
her
again
?
 
<EOS>
in
the
wilderness
of
a
large
town
,
where
to
meet
with
an
individual
of
so
little
value
or
note
to
any
?
  
<EOS>
and
evening
after
evening
he
pace
the
same
street
in
which
he
have
hear
those
footstep
follow
him
,
peer
under
every
fantastic
,
discreditable
bonnet
,
in
the
hope
of
once
more
meeting
Esther
,
and
address
her
in
a
far
different
manner
from
what
he
have
do
before
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
return
,
night
after
night
,
disappoint
in
his
search
,
and
at
last
give
it
up
in
despair
,
and
try
to
recall
his
angry
feeling
towards
her
,
in
order
to
find
relief
from
his
present
self
-
reproach
.
  
<EOS>
He
often
look
at
Mary
,
and
wish
she
be
not
so
like
her
aunt
,
for
the
very
bodily
likeness
seem
to
suggest
the
possibility
of
a
similar
likeness
in
their
fate
;
and
then
this
idea
enrage
his
irritable
mind
,
and
he
become
suspicious
and
anxious
about
Mary
's
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
now
hitherto
<EOS>
she
have
be
so
remarkably
free
from
all
control
,
and
almost
from
all
inquiry
concern
her
action
,
that
she
do
not
brook
this
change
in
her
father
's
behaviour
very
well
.
<EOS>
just
when
she
be
yield
more
than
ever
to
Mr.
Carson
's
desire
of
frequent
meeting
,
it
be
hard
to
be
so
question
concern
her
hour
of
leave
off
work
,
whether
she
have
come
straight
home
,
etc
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
tell
lie
;
though
she
could
conceal
much
if
she
be
not
question
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
take
refuge
in
obstinate
silence
,
allege
as
a
reason
for
it
her
indignation
at
be
so
cross
-
examine
.
 
<EOS>
this
do
not
add
to
the
good
feeling
between
father
and
daughter
,
and
yet
they
dearly
love
each
other
;
and
in
the
mind
of
each
,
one
principal
reason
for
maintain
such
behaviour
as
displease
the
other
,
be
the
believing
that
this
conduct
would
insure
that
person
's
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
now
begin
to
wish
Mary
be
marry
.
 
<EOS>
then
this
terrible
superstitious
fear
suggest
by
her
likeness
to
Esther
would
be
do
away
with
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
that
he
could
not
resume
the
rein
he
have
once
slacken
.
 
<EOS>
but
with
a
husband
it
would
be
different
.
 
<EOS>
if
Jem
Wilson
would
but
marry
her
!
 
<EOS>
with
his
character
for
steadiness
and
talent
!
<EOS>
but
he
be
afraid
Mary
have
slight
him
,
he
come
so
seldom
now
to
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
ask
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
what
be
come
o'er
thee
and
Jem
Wilson
?
 
<EOS>
You
be
great
friend
at
one
time

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
folk
say
he
be
go
to
be
married
to
Molly
Gibson
,
and
of
course
court
take
up
a
deal
o

time

answer
Mary
,
as
indifferently
as
she
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou'st
play
thy
card
badly
,
then
,
"
reply
her
father
,
in
a
surly
tone

<EOS>
"
at
one
time
he
be
desperate
fond
o
'
thee

or
I
be
much
mistaken

<EOS>
much
fonder
of
thee
than
thou
deservedst

that
be

say
Mary
pertly
,
for
she
remember
that
the
very
morning
before
she
have
meet
Mr.
Carson
,
who
have
sigh
,
and
swear
,
and
protest
all
manner
of
tender
vow
that
she
be
the
lovely
,
sweetest
,
good
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
she
have
see
him
afterwards
ride
with
one
of
his
beautiful
sister
,
have
he
not
evidently
point
her
out
as
in
some
way
or
other
an
object
worthy
of
attention
and
interest
,
and
then
linger
behind
his
sister
's
horse
for
a
moment
to
kiss
his
hand
repeatedly
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
as
for
Jem
Wilson
,
she
could
whistle
him
down
the
wind
.
  
<EOS>
but
her
father
be
not
in
the
mood
to
put
up
with
pertness
,
and
he
upbraid
her
with
the
loss
of
Jem
Wilson
till
she
have
to
bite
her
lip
till
the
blood
come
,
in
order
to
keep
down
the
angry
word
that
would
rise
in
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
her
father
leave
the
house
,
and
then
she
may
give
way
to
her
passionate
tear
.
  
<EOS>
It
so
happen
that
Jem
,
after
much
anxious
thought
,
have
determine
that
day
to
"
put
his
fortune
to
the
touch
,
to
win
or
lose
all
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
be
in
a
condition
to
maintain
a
wife
in
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
true
his
mother
and
aunt
must
form
part
of
the
household
:
but
such
be
not
an
uncommon
case
among
the
poor
,
and
if
there
be
the
advantage
of
previous
friendship
between
the
party
,
it
be
not
,
he
think
,
an
obstacle
to
matrimony
.
 
<EOS>
both
mother
and
aunt
,
he
believe
,
would
welcome
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
oh
!
<EOS>
what
a
certainty
of
happiness
<EOS>
the
idea
of
that
welcome
implied
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
be
absent
and
abstract
all
day
long
with
the
thought
of
the
come
event
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
He
almost
smile
at
himself
for
his
care
in
washing
and
dress
in
preparation
for
his
visit
to
Mary
;
as
if
one
waistcoat
or
another
could
decide
his
fate
in
so
passionately
a
momentous
thing
.
 
<EOS>
He
believe
he
only
delay
before
his
little
looking
-
glass
for
cowardice
,
for
absolute
fear
of
a
girl
.
<EOS>
He
would
try
not
to
think
so
much
about
the
affair
,
and
he
think
the
more
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Jem
!
<EOS>
it
be
not
an
auspicious
moment
for
thee
!
  
<EOS>
"
come
in
,
"
say
Mary
,
as
some
one
knock
at
the
door
,
while
she
sit
sadly
at
her
sewing
,
try
to
earn
a
few
penny
by
work
over
hour
at
some
mourning
.
  
<EOS>
Jem
enter
,
look
more
awkward
and
abash
than
he
have
ever
do
before
.
 
<EOS>
yet
here
be
Mary
all
alone
,
just
as
he
have
hope
to
find
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
ask
him
to
take
a
chair
,
but
after
stand
a
minute
or
two
<EOS>
he
sit
down
near
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
your
father
at
home
,
Mary
?
"
say
he
,
by
way
of
make
an
opening
,
for
she
seem
determined
to
keep
silence
,
and
go
on
stitch
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
he
be
go
to
his
Union
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
another
silence
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
use
wait
,
think
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
the
subject
would
never
be
lead
to
by
any
talk
he
could
think
of
in
his
anxious
,
fluttered
state
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
better
begin
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
!
"
say
he
,
and
the
unusual
tone
of
his
voice
make
her
look
up
for
an
instant
,
but
in
that
time
she
understand
from
his
countenance
what
be
come
,
and
her
heart
beat
so
suddenly
and
violently
she
could
hardly
sit
still
.
 
<EOS>
yet
one
thing
she
be
sure
of
;
nothing
he
could
say
should
make
her
have
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
show
them
all
who
would
be
glad
to
have
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
not
yet
calm
after
her
father
's
irritate
speech
.
 
<EOS>
yet
her
eye
fall
veil
before
that
passionate
look
fix
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Mary
!
<EOS>
(
for
how
dear
you

I
can
not

<EOS>
It

You

you

<EOS>
I
would
no

I
scorn
to

tie
you
down

I
live
in
terror
lest

you

now

Mary

I

"
as
she
,
in
her
unbearable
agitation
,
stand
up
and
turn
away
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
rise
too
,
and
come
nearer
,
try
to
take
hold
of
her
hand
;
but
this
she
would
not
allow

<EOS>
She
be
brace
herself
up

for
once

for
all

<EOS>
"
and
now
,
Mary

I
have
a
home
to
offer
you
,
and
a
heart
as
true

man
have
to

you

cherish
you

we
shall
never

rich
folk
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
;
but
if
a
love
heart
and
a
strong
right
arm
can
shield
you
from
sorrow
,
or
from
want
,
mine
shall
do
it

<EOS>
I
can
not
speak
as
I
would
like
;
my
love
will
not
let
itself
be
put
in

.
<EOS>
but
,
oh
!
<EOS>
darle
,
say
you
will
believe
me

and
that
you
will

mine

"
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
speak
at
once
;
her
word
would
not
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
they
say
silence
give
consent

be
it
so
?
"
<EOS>
he
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
now
or
never
the
effort
must
be
make
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no

<EOS>
it
do
not

"
 
<EOS>
Her
voice
be
calm
,
although
she
tremble
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
always
be
your
friend

Jem

but
I
can
never

your

<EOS>
"
  
"
not
my

"
say
he
mournfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
o
Mary
,
think
awhile
!
<EOS>
you
can
not

my
friend
if
you
will

<EOS>
at

,
I
can
never

to
be
only
your

<EOS>
do
think
awhile
!
 
<EOS>
if
you

no

you
will
make
me
hopeless

desperate

<EOS>
It
be
no
love

yesterday

<EOS>
It
have
make
the
very
groundwork
of
all
that
people
call
good

me

I
do
not

what
I
shall
be

<EOS>
and
,
Mary

think
how
glad
your
father
would
be
!
 
<EOS>
It
may
sound
vain
,
but
he
be
tell
me
more
than
once
how
much
he
should
like
to
see
us
<EOS>
two
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
intend
this
for
a
powerful
argument
,
but
in
Mary
's
present
mood
it
tell
against
him
more
than
anything
;
for
it
suggest
the
false
and
foolish
idea
that
her
father
,
in
his
evident
anxiety
to
promote
her
marriage
with
Jem
,
have
be
speak
to
him
on
the
subject
with
some
degree
of
solicitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
Jem
,
it
can
not
be
.
 
<EOS>
once
for
all
,
I
will
never
marry
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
be
this
the
end
of
all
my
hope
and
fear
?
<EOS>
the
end
of
my
life
,
I
may
say
,
for
<EOS>
it
be
the
end
of
all
worth
live
for
!
"
 
<EOS>
His
agitation
rise
and
carry
him
into
passion
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
you
will
hear
,
maybe
,
of
me
as
a
drunkard
,
and
maybe
as
a
thief
,
and
maybe
as
a
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
remember
!
<EOS>
when
all
be
speak
ill
of
me
,
you
will
have
no
right
to
blame
me
,
for
it
be
your
cruelty
that
will
have
make
me
what
I
feel
I
shall
become
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
not
even
say
you
will
try
and
like
me
;
will
you
,
Mary
?
"
say
he
,
suddenly
change
his
tone
from
threaten
despair
to
fond
,
passionate
entreaty
,
as
he
take
her
hand
and
hold
it
forcibly
between
both
of
his
,
while
he
try
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
averted
face
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
silent
,
but
it
be
from
deep
and
violent
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
to
wait
;
he
would
not
hope
,
to
be
dash
away
again
;
he
rather
in
his
bitterness
of
heart
choose
the
certainty
of
despair
,
and
before
she
could
resolve
what
to
answer
,
he
fling
away
her
hand
and
rush
out
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jem
!
Jem
!
"
<EOS>
cry
she
,
with
faint
and
choking
voice
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
too
late
;
he
leave
street
after
street
behind
him
with
his
almost
wing
speed
,
as
he
seek
the
field
,
where
he
may
give
way
unobserved
to
all
the
deep
despair
he
feel
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
scarcely
ten
minute
since
he
have
enter
the
house
,
and
find
Mary
at
comparative
peace
,
and
now
she
lie
half
across
the
dresser
,
her
head
hide
in
her
hand
,
and
every
part
of
her
body
shake
with
the
violence
of
her
sobs
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
tell
at
first
(
if
you
have
ask
her
,
and
she
could
have
command
voice
enough
to
answer
)
why
she
be
in
such
agonize
grief
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
too
sudden
for
her
to
analyse
,
or
think
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
only
feel
that
by
her
own
do
her
life
would
be
hereafter
blank
and
dreary
.
 
<EOS>
By-
<EOS>
and
-
bye
her
sorrow
exhaust
her
body
by
its
power
,
and
she
seem
to
have
no
strength
leave
for
cry
.
 
<EOS>
She
sit
down
;
and
now
thought
crowd
on
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
one
little
hour
ago
,
and
all
be
still
unsaid
,
and
she
have
her
fate
in
her
own
power
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
how
long
ago
have
she
determine
to
say
pretty
much
what
she
do
,
if
the
occasion
ever
offer
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
as
if
two
people
be
argue
the
matter
;
that
mournful
desponding
communion
between
her
former
self
,
and
her
present
self
.
<EOS>
Herself
,
a
day
,
an
hour
ago
;
and
herself
now
.
 
<EOS>
for
we
have
every
one
of
us
feel
how
a
very
few
minute
of
the
month
and
year
call
life
,
will
sometimes
suffice
to
place
all
time
past
and
future
in
an
entirely
new
light
;
will
make
us
see
the
vanity
or
the
criminality
of
the
bygone
,
and
so
change
the
aspect
of
the
come
time
that
we
look
with
loathing
on
the
very
thing
we
have
most
desire
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
moment
may
change
our
character
for
life
,
by
give
a
totally
different
direction
to
our
aim
and
energy
.
  
<EOS>
to
return
to
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
Her
plan
have
be
,
as
we
well
know
,
to
marry
Mr.
Carson
,
and
the
occurrence
an
hour
ago
be
only
a
preliminary
step
.
<EOS>
true
;
but
it
have
unveil
her
heart
to
her
;
it
have
convince
her
that
she
love
Jem
above
all
person
or
thing
.
 
<EOS>
but
Jem
be
a
poor
mechanic
,
with
a
mother
and
aunt
to
keep
;
a
mother
,
too
,
who
have
show
her
pretty
clearly
that
she
do
not
desire
her
for
a
daughter
-
in
-
law
:
while
Mr.
Carson
be
rich
,
and
prosperous
,
and
gay
,
and
(
she
believe
)
would
place
her
in
all
circumstance
of
ease
and
luxury
,
where
want
could
never
come
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
these
hollow
vanity
to
her
,
now
she
have
discover
the
passionate
secret
of
her
soul
?
 
<EOS>
She
feel
as
if
she
almost
hate
Mr.
Carson
,
who
have
decoy
her
with
his
bauble
.
 
<EOS>
She
now
see
how
vain
,
how
nothing
to
her
,
would
be
all
gaiety
and
pomp
,
all
joy
and
pleasure
,
unless
she
may
share
them
with
Jem
;
yes
,
with
him
she
have
harshly
reject
so
short
a
time
ago
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
be
poor
,
she
love
him
all
the
well
.
<EOS>
if
his
mother
do
think
her
unworthy
of
him
,
what
be
it
but
the
truth
?
<EOS>
as
she
now
own
with
bitter
penitence
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
hitherto
be
walk
in
grope
-
light
towards
a
precipice
;
but
in
the
clear
revelation
of
that
past
hour
she
see
her
danger
,
and
turn
away
resolutely
and
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
that
be
some
comfort
<EOS>
:
I
mean
her
clear
perception
of
what
she
ought
not
to
do
;
of
what
no
lure
temptation
should
ever
again
induce
her
to
hearken
to
.
 
<EOS>
how
she
could
best
undo
the
wrong
she
have
do
to
Jem
and
herself
by
refuse
his
love
be
another
anxious
question
.
 
<EOS>
She
weary
herself
by
propose
plan
,
and
reject
them
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
rouse
to
a
consciousness
of
time
by
hear
the
neighbour
church
clock
strike
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
<EOS>
she
know
may
be
expect
home
any
minute
,
and
she
be
in
no
mood
for
a
meeting
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
hastily
gather
up
her
work
,
and
go
to
her
own
little
bedroom
,
leave
him
to
let
himself
in
.
  
<EOS>
She
put
out
her
candle
,
that
her
father
may
not
see
its
light
under
the
door
;
and
sit
down
on
her
bed
to
think
.
 
<EOS>
but
again
,
turn
thing
over
in
her
mind
again
and
again
,
she
could
only
determine
at
once
to
put
an
end
to
all
further
communication
with
Mr.
Carson
,
in
the
most
decide
way
she
could
.
 
<EOS>
maidenly
modesty
(
and
true
love
be
ever
modest
)
seem
to
oppose
every
plan
she
could
think
of
,
for
show
Jem
how
much
she
repent
her
decision
against
him
,
and
how
dearly
she
have
now
discover
that
she
love
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
come
to
the
unusual
wisdom
of
resolve
to
do
nothing
,
but
strive
to
be
patient
,
and
improve
circumstance
as
they
may
turn
up
.
<EOS>
surely
,
if
Jem
know
of
her
remain
unmarried
,
he
would
try
his
fortune
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
never
be
content
with
one
rejection
;
she
believe
she
could
not
in
his
place
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
very
wrong
,
but
now
she
would
endeavour
to
do
right
,
and
have
womanly
patience
,
until
he
see
her
changed
and
repentant
mind
in
her
natural
action
.
<EOS>
even
if
she
have
to
wait
for
year
,
it
be
no
more
than
now
<EOS>
it
be
easy
to
look
forward
to
,
as
a
penance
for
her
giddy
flirting
on
the
one
hand
,
and
her
cruel
mistake
concern
her
feeling
on
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
so
anticipate
a
happy
ending
in
the
course
of
her
love
,
however
distant
it
may
be
,
she
fall
asleep
just
as
the
early
factory
bell
be
ring
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
sink
down
in
her
clothe
,
and
her
sleep
be
unrefreshe
.
 
<EOS>
She
waken
up
shivery
and
chill
in
body
,
and
sorrow
-
stricken
in
mind
,
though
she
could
not
at
first
rightly
tell
the
cause
of
her
depression
.
  
<EOS>
She
recall
the
event
of
the
night
before
,
and
still
resolve
to
adhere
to
the
determination
she
have
then
form
.
 
<EOS>
but
patience
seem
a
far
more
difficult
virtue
this
morning
.
  
<EOS>
She
hasten
downstairs
,
and
in
her
earnest
,
sad
desire
to
do
right
,
now
take
much
pain
to
secure
a
comfortable
though
scanty
breakfast
for
her
father
;
and
when
he
dawdle
into
the
room
,
in
an
evidently
irritable
temper
,
she
bear
all
with
the
gentleness
of
penitence
,
till
at
last
her
mild
answer
turn
away
wrath
.
  
<EOS>
She
loathe
the
idea
of
meet
Sally
Leadbitter
at
her
daily
work
;
yet
it
must
be
do
,
and
she
try
to
nerve
herself
for
the
encounter
,
and
to
make
it
at
once
understand
,
that
have
determine
to
give
up
have
anything
further
to
do
with
Mr.
Carson
<EOS>
,
she
consider
the
bond
of
intimacy
break
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
but
Sally
be
not
the
person
to
let
these
resolution
be
carry
into
effect
too
easily
.
 
<EOS>
She
soon
become
aware
of
the
present
state
of
Mary
's
feeling
,
but
she
think
they
merely
arise
from
the
changeableness
of
girlhood
,
and
that
the
time
would
come
when
Mary
would
thank
her
for
almost
force
her
to
keep
up
her
meeting
and
communication
with
her
rich
lover
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
when
two
day
have
pass
over
in
rather
too
marked
avoidance
of
Sally
on
Mary
's
part
,
and
when
the
former
be
make
aware
by
Mr.
Carson
's
complaint
that
Mary
be
not
keep
her
appointment
with
him
,
and
that
unless
he
detain
her
by
force
,
he
have
no
chance
of
obtain
a
word
as
she
pass
him
in
the
street
on
her
rapid
walk
home
,
she
resolve
to
compel
Mary
to
what
she
call
her
own
good
.
  
<EOS>
She
take
no
notice
during
the
third
day
of
Mary
's
avoidance
as
they
sit
at
work
;
she
rather
seem
to
acquiesce
in
the
coolness
of
their
intercourse
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
away
her
sewing
early
,
and
go
home
to
her
mother
,
who
,
she
say
,
be
more
ailing
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
girl
soon
follow
her
example
,
and
Mary
,
cast
a
rapid
glance
up
and
down
the
street
,
as
she
stand
last
on
Miss
Simmonds
'
doorstep
,
darted
homeward
,
in
hope
of
avoid
the
person
whom
she
be
fast
learn
to
dread
.
 
<EOS>
that
night
she
be
safe
from
any
encounter
on
her
road
,
and
she
arrive
at
home
,
which
she
find
,
as
she
expect
,
empty
<EOS>
;
for
she
know
it
be
a
club
night
,
which
her
father
would
not
miss
.
 
<EOS>
She
sit
down
to
recover
breath
,
and
to
still
her
heart
,
which
pant
more
from
nervousness
than
from
over
-
exertion
,
although
she
have
walk
so
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
arise
,
and
take
off
her
bonnet
<EOS>
,
her
eye
catch
the
form
of
Sally
Leadbitter
pass
the
window
with
a
linger
step
,
and
look
into
the
darkness
with
all
her
might
,
as
if
to
ascertain
if
Mary
be
return
.
 
<EOS>
in
an
instant
she
repasse
and
knock
at
the
house
-
door
;
but
without
await
an
answer
,
she
enter
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Mary
,
dear
"
(
know
well
how
little
<EOS>
"
dear
"
Mary
consider
her
just
then
)
;
"
it
be
so
difficult
to
get
any
comfortable
talk
at
Miss
Simmonds
'
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
would
just
step
up
and
see
you
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
,
from
what
you
say
,
your
mother
be
ail
,
and
that
you
want
to
be
with
her
,
"
reply
Mary
,
in
no
welcome
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
but
mother
's
well
now
,
"
say
the
unabashed
Sally
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
father
be
out
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
look
round
as
well
as
she
could
;
for
Mary
make
no
haste
to
perform
the
hospitable
office
of
strike
a
match
,
and
light
a
candle
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
he
be
out
,
"
say
Mary
shortly
,
and
busy
herself
at
last
about
the
candle
,
without
ever
ask
her
visitor
to
sit
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
much
the
well
,
"
answer
Sally
;
"
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
Mary
,
I
have
a
friend
at
th
'
end
of
the
road
,
as
be
anxious
to
come
and
see
you
at
home
,
since
you
be
grow
so
particular
as
not
to
like
to
speak
to
him
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
be
here
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
o
Sally
,
do
not
let
him
,
"
say
Mary
,
speak
at
last
heartily
;
and
run
to
the
door
,
she
would
have
fasten
it
,
but
Sally
hold
her
hand
,
laugh
meanwhile
at
her
distress
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
please
,
Sally
,
"
struggle
,
"
dear
Sally
!
<EOS>
do
not
let
him
come
here
,
the
neighbour
will
so
talk
,
and
father'll
go
mad
if
he
hear
;
he
will
kill
me
,
Sally
<EOS>
,
he
will
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
I
do
not
love
him
 
I
never
do
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
let
me
go
,
"
as
footstep
approach
;
and
then
,
as
they
pass
the
house
,
and
seem
to
give
her
a
respite
,
she
continue
,
"
do
,
Sally
,
dear
Sally
,
go
and
tell
him
I
do
not
love
him
,
and
that
I
do
not
want
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
wrong
,
I
dare
say
,
keep
company
with
him
at
all
,
but
I
be
very
sorry
,
if
I
have
lead
him
to
think
too
much
of
me
;
and
I
do
not
want
him
to
think
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
tell
him
this
,
Sally
?
<EOS>
and
I
will
do
anything
for
you
,
if
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
I
will
do
,
"
say
Sally
,
in
a
more
relent
mood
;
"
I
will
go
back
with
you
to
where
he
be
wait
for
us
;
or
rather
<EOS>
,
I
should
say
,
where
I
tell
him
to
wait
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
till
I
seed
if
your
father
be
at
home
;
and
if
I
do
not
come
back
in
that
time
,
he
say
he
would
come
here
,
and
break
the
door
open
<EOS>
but
he
would
see
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
let
us
go
,
let
us
go
,
"
say
Mary
,
feel
that
the
interview
must
be
,
and
have
well
be
anywhere
than
at
home
,
where
her
father
may
return
at
any
minute
.
 
<EOS>
She
snatch
up
her
bonnet
,
and
be
at
the
end
of
the
court
in
an
instant
;
but
then
,
not
know
whether
to
turn
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
,
she
be
oblige
to
wait
for
Sally
,
who
come
leisurely
up
,
and
put
her
arm
through
Mary
's
with
a
kind
of
decide
hold
,
intend
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
her
change
her
mind
and
turn
back
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
,
under
the
circumstance
,
be
quite
different
to
Mary
's
plan
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
wonder
more
than
once
if
she
must
not
have
another
interview
with
Mr.
Carson
;
and
have
then
determine
,
while
she
express
her
resolution
that
it
should
be
the
final
one
,
to
tell
him
how
sorry
she
be
if
she
have
thoughtlessly
give
him
false
hope
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
be
it
remember
,
she
have
the
innocence
,
or
the
ignorance
,
to
believe
his
intention
honourable
;
and
<EOS>
he
,
feel
that
at
any
price
he
must
have
her
,
only
that
he
would
obtain
her
as
cheaply
as
he
could
,
have
never
undeceive
her
;
while
Sally
Leadbitter
laugh
in
her
sleeve
at
them
both
,
and
wonder
how
it
would
all
end
 
whether
Mary
would
gain
her
point
of
marriage
,
with
her
sly
affectation
of
believe
such
to
be
Mr.
Carson
's
intention
in
court
her
.
  
<EOS>
not
very
far
from
the
end
of
the
street
,
into
which
the
court
where
Mary
live
open
,
they
meet
Mr.
Carson
,
his
hat
a
good
deal
slouch
over
his
face
,
as
if
afraid
of
be
recognise
.
 
<EOS>
He
turn
when
he
see
them
come
,
and
lead
the
way
without
utter
a
word
(
although
they
be
close
behind
)
to
a
street
of
half
-
finished
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
length
of
the
walk
give
Mary
time
to
recoil
from
the
interview
which
be
to
follow
;
but
even
if
her
own
resolve
to
go
through
with
it
have
fail
,
there
be
the
steady
grasp
of
Sally
Leadbitter
,
which
she
could
not
evade
without
an
absolute
struggle
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
he
stop
in
the
shelter
and
concealment
of
a
wooden
fence
,
put
up
to
keep
the
building
rubbish
from
intrude
on
the
foot
-
pavement
.
<EOS>
inside
this
fence
,
a
minute
afterwards
,
the
girl
be
stand
by
him
;
Mary
now
return
Sally
's
detaining
grasp
with
interest
,
for
she
have
determine
on
the
way
to
make
her
a
witness
,
willing
or
unwilling
,
to
the
ensue
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
but
Sally
's
curiosity
lead
her
to
be
a
very
passive
prisoner
in
Mary
's
hold
.
  
<EOS>
with
more
freedom
than
he
have
ever
use
before
,
Mr.
Carson
put
his
arm
firmly
round
Mary
's
waist
,
in
spite
of
her
indignant
resistance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
nay
!
<EOS>
you
little
witch
!
 
<EOS>
now
I
have
catch
you
,
I
shall
keep
you
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
tell
me
now
what
have
make
you
run
away
from
me
so
fast
<EOS>
these
few
day
 
tell
me
,
you
sweet
little
coquette
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
cease
struggle
,
but
turn
so
as
to
be
almost
opposite
to
him
,
while
she
speak
out
calmly
and
boldly
   
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Carson
!
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
to
you
for
once
and
for
all

<EOS>
since
I
meet
you
last
Monday
evening
,
I
have
make
up
my
mind
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
have
be
wrong
in
lead
you
to
think
I
like
you
;
but
I
believe
I

if
I

you
to

"
  
<EOS>
for
an
instant
he
be
surprised
;
the
next
,
vanity
come
to
his
aid
,
and
convince
him
that
she
could
only
be

humbly
beg
my
pardon

you
have
make
me

too
much

<EOS>
as
if
you
do
not
know
I
think
of
you
from
morning
till
night
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
want
to
be

as

puzzle
by
his
perseverance
in

hesitate
in
what

she
could

put

You

how
little

give

one

exceed
great
relief

she
have
dread

she
know

call
out

load
herself
with
reproach

the
misery
she
may

It
be
a
relief
to
gather
that
the
attachment
be
of
that
low
despicable
kind
which
can
plan
to
seduce
the
object
of
its
affection

that
the
feeling
she
have
cause
be
shallow
enough

for
it
only
pretend
to
embrace
self

at
the
expense
of
the
misery

the
ruin

of
one
falsely
term
beloved

She
nee
not

relief

no

I

if
you
do

why
(
if
I
may
be
so
bold
as
to
ask
)
do
you
go
and
tell
her
you
have
no

otherwise
by
her

<EOS>
that
be
what
put
her
up
at
last

why
,
I
have
repeatedly
before
lead
her
to
infer
that

not
my

<EOS>
I
never
dream
she
could
have
be
so
foolish
as
to
have
mistake
me

little
provoking
romancer
though
she
be

so
I
naturally
wish
her
to
know
what
a
sacrifice
of
prejudice
,
of
 
of
myself
,
in
short
,
I
be
willing

make
for

it

may
have
any
lady
in

I
be
willing

now

do

a

I
be
make

no

He

though
that

the

him
to
the

then
the

like

You

where
have
you
be
to

first
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
eh
,
lass
,
that
would
take
a
long
time
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
half
o'er
the
world
,
I
sometimes
think
.
 
<EOS>
Bolton
and
Bury
,
and
Owdham
,
and
Halifax
,
and
 
but
Mary
,
guess
who
I
see
there
?
 
<EOS>
maybe
you
know
,
though
,
so
it
be
not
fair
guessing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
dunnot
.
 
<EOS>
tell
me
,
Margaret
,
for
I
can
not
abide
wait
and
guess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
one
night
as
I
be
go
fra
'
my
lodging
wi
'
the
help
on
a
lad
as
belong
to
th
'
landlady
,
to
find
the
room
where
I
be
to
sing
,
I
hear
a
cough
before
me
,
walk
along
.
 
<EOS>
think
I
<EOS>
,
that
be
Jem
Wilson
's
cough
,
or
I
be
much
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
next
time
come
a
sneeze
and
cough
,
and
then
I
be
certain
.
 
<EOS>
first
I
hesitate
whether
I
should
speak
,
think
if
it
be
a
stranger
<EOS>
he
would
maybe
think
me
forrard
.
<EOS>
*
 
<EOS>
but
I
know
blind
folk
must
not
be
nesh
about
use
their
tongue
,
so
<EOS>
say
I
,
"
Jem
Wilson
,
be
that
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
and
sure
enough
it
be
,
and
nobody
else
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
know
he
be
in
Halifax
,
Mary
?
<EOS>
"
     
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
she
answer
,
faintly
and
sadly
;
for
Halifax
be
all
the
same
to
her
heart
as
the
Antipodes
;
equally
inaccessible
by
humble
penitent
look
and
maidenly
token
of
love
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
he
be
there
,
however
:
he
be
put
up
an
engine
for
some
folk
there
,
for
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
do
well
,
for
he
be
getten
four
or
five
man
under
him
;
we
would
two
or
three
meeting
,
and
he
tell
me
all
about
his
invention
for
do
away
wi
'
the
crank
,
or
somewhat
.
<EOS>
His
master
's
buy
it
from
him
,
and
ta'en
out
a
patent
,
and
Jem
be
a
gentleman
for
life
<EOS>
wi
'
the
money
his
master
gi
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
will
ha
'
hear
all
this
,
Mary
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
she
have
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
think
it
all
happen
afore
<EOS>
he
leave
Manchester
,
and
then
in
course
you
would
ha
'
know
.
 
<EOS>
but
maybe
it
be
all
settle
after
he
get
to
Halifax
;
however
,
he
be
get
two
or
three
hunder
pound
for
his
invention
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
be
up
with
you
,
Mary
?
<EOS>
you
be
sadly
out
of
sort
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
never
be
quarrel
wi
'
Jem
,
surely
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
now
Mary
cry
outright
;
she
be
weak
in
body
,
and
unhappy
in
mind
,
and
the
time
be
come
when
she
may
have
the
relief
of
tell
her
grief
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
confess
how
much
of
her
sorrow
be
cause
by
her
have
be
vain
and
foolish
;
she
hope
that
nee
never
be
know
,
and
she
could
not
bear
to
think
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
Margaret
!
<EOS>
do
you
know
Jem
come
here
one
night
when
I
be
put
out
,
and
cross
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
dear
!
<EOS>
dear
!
<EOS>
I
could
bite
my
tongue
out
when
I
think
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
tell
me
how
he
love
me
,
and
I
think
I
do
not
love
him
,
and
I
tell
him
I
do
not
;
<EOS>
and
,
Margaret
,
 
he
believe
me
,
and
go
away
so
sad
,
and
so
angry
;
and
now
,
I
would
do
anything
 
I
would
indeed
"
;
her
sobs
choke
the
end
of
her
sentence
.
 
<EOS>
Margaret
look
at
her
with
sorrow
,
but
with
hope
;
for
she
have
no
doubt
in
her
own
mind
,
that
it
be
only
a
temporary
estrangement
,
  
<EOS>
"
tell
me
,
Margaret
,
"
say
Mary
,
take
her
apron
down
from
her
eye
,
and
look
at
Margaret
with
eager
anxiety
,
"
what
can
I
do
to
bring
him
back
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
Should
I
write
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
"
reply
her
friend
,
"
that
would
not
do

<EOS>
man
be
so
queer
,
they
like
to
have
a
'
the
courting
to
themselves
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
not
mean
to
write
him
a
courting
letter
,
"
say
Mary
,
somewhat
indignantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
write
at
all
,
it
would
be
to
give
him
a
hint
you
would
take
the
rue
,
and
would
be
very
glad
to
have
him
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
now
he
would
rather
find
that
out
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
he
will
not
try
,
"
say
Mary
,
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
can
he
find
it
out
when
he
be
at
Halifax
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
he
be
a
will
<EOS>
he
be
a
way
,
depend
upon
it

<EOS>
and
you
would
not
have
him
if
he
be
not
a
will
to
you
,
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
no
,
dear
!
"
<EOS>
change
her
tone
from
the
somewhat
hard
way
in
which
sensible
people
too
often
speak
,
to
the
soft
accent
of
tenderness
which
come
with
such
peculiar
grace
from
them
,
"
you
must
just
wait
and
be
patient
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
depend
upon
it
,
all
will
end
well
,
and
well
than
if
you
meddle
in
it
now

<EOS>
"
but
it
be
so
hard
to
be
patient
,
"
plead
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
dear
;
be
patient
be
the
hard
work
<EOS>
we
,
any
of
us
,
have
to
do
through
life

,
I
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
Waiting
be
far
more
difficult
than
do

<EOS>
I
have
know
that
about
my
sight
,
and
many
a
one
have
know
it
in
watch
the
sick

it
be
one
of
God
's
lesson
we
all
must
learn

one
way

another

<EOS>
after
a
pause
 
"
have
ye
be
to
see
his
mother
of
late

"
  
<EOS>

no

not
for

I
go

so
frabbit

with
me

<EOS>
"
well
!
<EOS>
if
I
be
you
I
would
go
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
will
hear
on't
,
and
it
will
do
you
far
more
good
in
his
mind
than
write
a
letter
,
which
,
after
all
,
you
would
find
a
tough
piece
of
work
when
you
come
to
settle
to
it

t
would
be
hard
to
say
neither
too
much

too
little

I
must
be
go

grandfather
be
at
home

it
be
our
first
night
together

rise
up
from

Mary
!

I
have
somewhat
else
<EOS>
I
want
to
say
to
you

I
do
not
rightly
know
how
to
begin
.
 
<EOS>
You
see

grandfather

I
know
what
bad
time
be

<EOS>
we
know
your
father
be
out
of
work

I
be
get
more
money
than
I
can
well
manage
;
and
,
dear

would
you
just
take
this
bit
o
'
gold
,
and
pay
me
back
in
good
time
?

the
tear
stand
in
Margaret

eye
as
she
speak

<EOS>
"
Dear
Margaret
,
we
be
not
so
bad
press
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
the
thought
of
her
father
and
his
ill
look
,
and
his
one
meal
a
day
,
rush
upon
Mary
.
)
 
<EOS>
"
and
yet
,
dear
,
if
it
would
not
put
you
out
o
'
your
way
 
I
would
work
hard
to
make
it
up
to
you
;
 
but
would
not
your
grandfather
be
vex
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
he
,
wench
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
more
his
thought
than
mine
,
and
we
have
get
ever
so
many
more
at
home
,
so
do
not
hurry
yourself
about
pay
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
hard
to
be
blind
,
to
be
sure
,
else
money
come
in
so
easily
now
to
what
it
use
to
do
;
and
it
be
downright
pleasure
to
earn
it
,
for
I
do
so
like
singe
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
sing

"

Mary

look
at
the
sovereign

some
have
one
kind
of
gift

some
another

Many
be
the
time
when
I
could

that
I
long
for
your
beauty

<EOS>
We
be
like
childer
,
ever
want
what
we
han
not
get
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
I
must
say
just
one
more
word
.
 
<EOS>
remember
,
if
you
be
sore
press
for
money
,
we
shall
take
it
very
unkind
if
you
donnot
let
us
know
.
 
<EOS>
good
-
bye
to
ye
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
spite
of
her
blindness
she
hurry
away
,
anxious
to
rejoin
her
grandfather
,
and
desirous
also
to
escape
from
Mary
's
expression
of
gratitude
.
  
<EOS>
Her
visit
have
do
Mary
good
in
many
way
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
strengthen
her
patience
and
her
hope
;
it
have
give
her
confidence
in
Margaret
's
sympathy
;
and
last
,
and
really
least
in
comfort
power
(
of
so
little
value
be
silver
and
gold
in
comparison
to
love
,
that
gift
in
every
one
's
power
to
bestow
)
,
come
the
consciousness
of
the
money
-
value
of
the
sovereign
she
hold
in
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
many
thing
it
may
purchase
!
 
<EOS>
first
of
all
come
the
thought
of
the
comfortable
supper
for
her
father
that
very
night
;
and
act
instantly
upon
the
idea
,
she
set
off
in
hope
that
all
the
provision
shop
may
not
yet
be
close
,
although
it
be
so
late
.
  
<EOS>
that
night
the
cottage
shone
with
unusual
light
and
fire
gleam
;
and
the
father
and
daughter
sit
down
to
a
meal
they
think
almost
extravagant
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
long
since
they
have
have
enough
to
eat
.
  
<EOS>
"
food
give
heart
,
"
say
the
Lancashire
people
;
and
the
next
day
Mary
make
time
to
go
and
call
on
Mrs.
Wilson
,
accord
to
Margaret
's
advice
.
 
<EOS>
She
find
her
quite
alone
,
and
more
gracious
than
she
have
be
the
last
time
Mary
have
visit
her
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
be
go
out
,
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
just
step
up
to
the
post
-
office
,
all
for
no
earthly
use
.
<EOS>
for
it
be
to
ask
if
they
have
not
a
letter
lie
there
for
her
from
her
foster
-
son
,
Will
Wilson
,
the
sailor
-
lad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
make
her
think
there
be
a
letter
?
"
ask
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
yo
see
,
a
neighbour
as
have
be
in
Liverpool
,
tell
us
<EOS>
Will
's
ship
be
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
now
he
say
last
time
he
be
in
Liverpool
,
he
would
ha
'
come
to
ha
'
see
Alice
,
but
his
ship
have
<EOS>
but
a
week
holiday
,
and
hard
work
for
the
man
in
that
time
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
so
Alice
make
sure
he
will
come
this
,
and
have
have
her
hand
behind
her
ear
at
every
noise
in
th

think
it
be
him

<EOS>
and
to

day
she
be
neither

off
she
would
go

see
if

send
her
a
line
to
th

I
try

for
let
alone

deafness

be
getten
so
dark

she
can
not

no

I
do
not

enough

ay
,

it
be
go
lately
a
good
deal

you

in

how

I
can

rather
to
her
disappointment

Mary
own
she
have

of
the
sum

It

why

climate
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
be
in
land
where
muslin
be
too
hot
to
wear
on
land
,
and
where
the
sea
be
more
than
milk
-
warm
;
and
<EOS>
though
I
would
never
the
good
luck
to
see
a
mermaid
in
that
latitude
,
I
know
them
that
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
tell
us
about
it
,
"
cry
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pooh
,
pooh
!
<EOS>
"
say
Job
,
the
naturalist
.
  
<EOS>
both
speech
determine
Will
to
go
on
with
his
story
.
 
<EOS>
what
could
a
fellow
who
have
never
be
many
mile
from
home
know
about
the
wonder
of
the
deep
,
that
he
should
put
him
down
in
that
way
?
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
it
be
Jack
Harris
,
our
third
mate
last
voyage
,
as
many
and
many
a
time
tell
us
all
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
he
be
becalm
off
Chatham
Island
(
that
be
in
the
Great
Pacific
,
and
a
warm
enough
latitude
for
mermaid
,
and
shark
,
and
such
like
peril
)
.
 
<EOS>
so
some
of
the
man
take
the
long
-
boat
,
and
pull
for
the
island
to
see
what
it
be
like
;
and
when
they
get
near
,
they
hear
a
puffing
,
like
a
creature
come
up
to
take
breath
;
you
have
never
hear
a
diver
?
 
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
well
;
you
have
hear
folk
in
th
'
asthma
,
and
it
be
for
all
the
world
like
that
.
 
<EOS>
so
they
look
around
,
and
what
should
they
see
but
a
mermaid
,
sit
on
a
rock
,
and
sun
herself
.
 
<EOS>
the
water
be
always
warm
when
it
be
rough
,
you
know
,
so
I
suppose
in
the
calm
she
feel
it
rather
chilly
,
and
have
come
up
to
warm
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
she
like
?
"
ask
Mary
breathlessly
.
  
<EOS>
Job
take
his
pipe
off
the
chimney
-
piece
,
and
begin
to
smoke
with
very
audible
puff
,
as
if
the
story
be
not
worth
listen
to
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Jack
use
to
say
she
be
for
all
the
world
as
beautiful
as
any
of
the
wax
lady
in
the
barber
'
shop
;
only
,
Mary
,
there
be
one
little
difference
;
her
hair
be
bright
grass
-
green
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
think
that
be
pretty
,
"
say
Mary
hesitatingly
;
as
if
not
like
to
doubt
the
perfection
of
anything
belong
to
such
an
acknowledge
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
but
it
be
when
you
be
use
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
think
when
first
we
get
sight
of
land
,
there
be
no
colour
so
lovely
as
grass
-
green
.
<EOS>
however
,
she
have
green
hair
sure
enough
:
and
be
proud
enough
of
it
,
too
;
for
she
be
comb
it
out
full
length
when
first
they
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
think
she
be
a
fair
prize
,
and
maybe
as
good
as
a
whale
in
ready
money
(
they
be
whale
-
fisher
,
you
know
)
.
 
<EOS>
for
some
folk
think
a
deal
of
mermaid
,
whatever
other
folk
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
hit
at
Job
,
who
retaliate
in
a
series
of
sonorous
spitting
and
puff
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
,
as
I
be
say
,
they
pull
towards
her
,
think
to
catch
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
all
the
while
comb
her
beautiful
hair
,
and
beckon
to
them
,
while
with
the
other
hand
she
hold
a
looking
-
glass
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
many
hand
have
she
?
"
ask
Job
.
  
<EOS>
"
two
,
to
be
sure
,
just
like
any
other
woman

"
answer
Will
indignantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
think
you
say
she
beckon
with
one
hand
,
and
comb
her
hair
with
another
,
and
hold
a
looking
-
glass
with
her
third
,
"

Job
,
with
provoking
quietness
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
!
<EOS>
at

,
if
I
do
,
I
mean
she
do
one
thing
after
another
,
as
anyone

<EOS>
"
(
here
he
mumble
a
word
or
two
)

could
understand
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
Mary
,
"
turn
very
decidedly
towards
her
,
"
when
she
see
them
come
near
,
whether
it
be
she
grow
frightened
at
their
fowling
-
piece
,
as
they
have
on
board
for
a
bit
<EOS>
o
'
shooting
on
the
island
,
or
whether
it
be
she
be
just
a
fickle
jade
as
do
not
rightly
know
her
own
mind
(
which
,
see
one
half
of
her
be
woman
,
I
think
myself
be
most
probably
)
,
but
when
they
be
only
about
two
oar
'
length
from
the
rock
where
she
sit
,
down
she
plop
into
the
water
,
leave
nothing
but
her
hinder
end
of
a
fish
tail
stick
up
for
a
minute
,

then
that
disappear
too

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
do
they
never
see
her
again
?
"
ask
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
never
so
plain
;
the
man
who
have
the
second
watch
one
night
declare
he
see
her
swimming
round
the
ship
,
and
hold
up
her
glass
for
him
to
look
in
;
and
then
he
see
the
little
cottage
near
Aber
in
Wales
(
where
his
wife
live
)
as
plain
as
ever
<EOS>
he
see
it
in
life

his
wife
stand
outside
,
shade
her
eye
as
if
she
be
look
for
him

<EOS>
but
Jack
Harris
give
him
no
credit

for
he
say
he
be
always
a
bit
of
a
romancer

beside
that

a

sick

down

hearted

one

will

that
I
have
often
see
with
my
own
eye

I
reckon
it
be
a

proof

the
truth
of
their

that
want
proof

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Margaret
,
almost
anxious
her
grandfather
should
be
convince

<EOS>
"
why

in

hurry
she
leave

comb
on

it

they

nothing

they
row
there

take
it
,

Jack
Harris
have
it
on

the
John

I

every
Sunday

what

why

<EOS>
"
I

sneered
Job
Legh

<EOS>
the
sailor
bite
his
lip
to
keep
down
his
anger
against
an
old
man

Margaret
feel
very
uneasy
,
know
her
grandfather
so
well
,

not
dare
to
guess
what
caustic
remark
may
come
next
to
irritate
the
young
sailor
guest
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
,
however
,
be
too
much
interested
by
the
wonder
of
the
deep
to
perceive
the
incredulity
with
which
Job
Legh
receive
Wilson
's
account
of
the
mermaid
,
and
when
he
leave
off

half
offended
,

very
much
inclined
not

open
his
lip
again
through
the
evening

that

not
so
Job

He
put
down

nod
his

as
a
token
of
approbation

Job
Legh
,
sincere
man
as
he
be
,
would
have
pretend
belief

he
be
so
much
delighted
at
the
idea
of
possess
this
speciman

<EOS>
He
win
the
sailor
's
heart
by
get
up
to
shake
both
his
hand
in
his
vehement
gratitude
,
puzzle
poor
old
Alice

who
yet
smile
through
her
wonder

for
she
understand
the
action
to
indicate
some
kindly
feeling
towards
her
nephew

<EOS>
Job
want
to
prove
his
gratitude
,
and
be
puzzle
how
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
fear
the
young
man
would
not
appreciate
any
of
his
duplicate
araneide
;
not
even
the
great
American
Mygale
,
one
of
his
most
precious
treasure
;
or
else
he
would
gladly
have
bestow
any
duplicate
on
the
donor
of
a
real
dry
Exocetus
.
 
<EOS>
what
could
he
do
for
him
?
 
<EOS>
He
could
ask
Margaret
to
sing
.
 
<EOS>
other
folk
beside
her
old
doting
grandfather
think
a
deal
of
her
song
.
 
<EOS>
so
Margaret
begin
some
of
her
noble
old
-
fashioned
song
.
 
<EOS>
She
know
no
modern
music
(
for
which
her
auditor
may
have
be
thankful
)
,
but
she
pour
her
rich
voice
out
in
some
of
the
old
canzonet
she
have
lately
learn
while
accompany
the
musical
lecturer
on
his
tour
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
be
amuse
to
see
how
the
young
sailor
sit
entrance
;
mouth
,
eye
,
all
open
,
in
order
to
catch
every
breath
of
sound
.
 
<EOS>
His
very
lid
refuse
to
wink
,
as
if
afraid
in
that
brief
proverbial
interval
to
lose
a
particle
of
the
rich
music
that
float
through
the
room
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
the
idea
cross
Mary
's
mind
that
it
be
possible
the
plain
little
sensible
Margaret
,
so
prim
and
demure
,
may
have
power
over
the
heart
of
the
handsome
,
dash
spirit
Will
Wilson
.
  
<EOS>
Job
,
too
,
be
rapidly
change
his
opinion
of
his
new
guest
.
 
<EOS>
the
fly
fish
go
a
great
way
,
and
his
undisguised
admiration
for
Margaret

singing
carry
him
still
further
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
amusing
enough
to
see
these
two
,
within
the
hour
so
barely
civil
to
each
other
,
endeavour
now
to
be
ultra
-
agreeable

<EOS>
Will
,
as
soon
as
he
have
take
breath
(
a
long
,
deep
gasp
of
admiration
)
<EOS>
after
Margaret
's
song
,
sidle
up
to
Job
,
and
ask
him
in
a
sort
of
doubt
tone
   
<EOS>
"
You
would
not

would
ye

"
a
what

"
exclaim
Job

<EOS>
"
I
do
not

say
Will
humbly

"

we
call
'em
just
Manx
cat

They
be
cat
without
tail

<EOS>
now
Job

in
all
his

have
never
hear

Mary
think
of

long
-
cherish

fond
wish
to
revisit
the
home

so
often

often
defer

there

merry
farewell
,
and
Mary
be
once
more
in
the
quietness

solitude
of
her
own
dingy
,
dreary
-
looking
home
;
her
father
still
out

the
fire
extinguish
,
and
her
evening
's
task
of
work
lie
all
undone
upon
the

it
have
be
a
pleasant
little
interlude

think
upon

It
have
distract
her
attention
for
a
few
hour
from
the
pressure
of
many
uneasy
thought
,
of
the
dark
,
heavy
,
oppressive
time

when
sorrow
and
want
seem
to
surround
her
on
every
side
;
of
her
father
,
his
change
and
alter
look
,
tell
so
plainly
of
broken
health

an
embittered
heart
;
of
the
morrow

the
morrow
beyond
that

to
be
spend
in
that
close
monotonous
workroom

with
Sally

odious
whisper

look

so
full

dread

Miss
Simmonds

step
up

down
the
street

lest
her
persecuting
lover
should
be
near

for
he
lie
in
wait
for
her
with
wonderful
perseverance
,
and
of
late
have
make
himself
almost
hateful
,
by
the
unmanly
force
which
he
have
use
to
detain
her
to
listen
to
him
,

the
indifference
with
which
he
expose
her
to
the
remark

the
passer

daily
quantity
of

have
never

extra
punishment
of

have
be

once
more
she
be
out

<EOS>
the
door
close
behind
her
with
a
ponderous
clang
,
and
in
her
desolation
she
feel
as
if
shut
out

from
the
only
shelter
she
could
meet
with
,
houseless

it

one
thought
have
haunt
her
both
by
night
and
by
day
,
with
monomaniacal
incessancy
;
and
that
thought
be
how
to
save
Mary
(
her
dead
sister
's
only
child
,
her
own
little
pet
in
the
day
of
her
innocence

from
follow
in
the
same
downward
path
to
vice
.
 
<EOS>
to
whom
could
she
speak
and
ask
for
aid
?
 
<EOS>
She
shrink
from
the
idea
of
address
John

again
;
her
heart
sink
within
her
,
at
the
remembrance
of
his
fierce
repulsing
action
,
and
far
fiercer
word
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
bad
than
death
to
reveal
her
condition
to
Mary
,
<EOS>
else
she
sometimes
think
that
this
course
would
be
the
most
terrible
,
the
most
efficient
warning
.
 
<EOS>
She
must
speak
;
to
that
she
be
soul
-
compel
;
but
to
whom
?
 
<EOS>
She
dread
address
any
of
her
former
female
acquaintance
,
even
suppose
they
have
sense
,
or
spirit
,
or
interest
enough
to
undertake
her
mission

<EOS>
to
whom
shall
the
outcast
prostitute
tell
her
tale
?
 
<EOS>
who
will
give
her
help
in
the
day
of
need
?
 
<EOS>
Hers
be
the
leper
sin
,
and
all
stand
aloof
dread
to
be
count
unclean
.
  
<EOS>
in
her
wild
night
wandering
,
she
have
note
the
haunt
and
habit
of
many
a
one
who
little
thought
of
a
watcher
in
the
poor
forsaken
woman
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
easily
imagine
that
a
double
interest
be
attach
by
her
to
the
way
and
companionship
of
those
with
whom
she
have
be
acquaint
in
the
day
which
,
when
present
,
she
have
consider
hardly
-
work
and
monotonous
,
but
which
now
in
retrospection
seem
so
happy
and
unclouded
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
she
have
,
as
we
have
see
,
know
where
to
meet
with
John
Barton
on
that
unfortunate
night
,
which
have
only
produce
irritation
in
him
,
and
a
month
's
imprisonment
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
also
observe
that
he
be
still
intimate
with

Wilsons

<EOS>
She
have
see
him
walk
and
talk
with
both
father
and
son
;
her
old
friend
too
;
and
she
have
shed
unregarded
,
unvalued
tear
,
when
some
one
have
casually
tell
her
of
George
Wilson
's
sudden
death
.
 
<EOS>
It
now
flash
across
her
mind
that
to
the
son
,
to
Mary
's
playfellow
,
her
eld
brother
in
the
day
of
childhood
,
her
tale
may
be
tell
,
and
listen
to
with
interest
by
him
,
and
some
mode
of
action
suggest
by
which
Mary
may
be
guard
and
save
.
  
<EOS>
all
these
thought
have
pass
through
her
mind
while
yet
she
be
in
prison
;
so
when
she
be
turn
out
,
her
purpose
be
clear
,
and
she
do
not
feel
her
desolation
of
freedom
as
she
would
otherwise
have
do
.
  
<EOS>
that
night
she
station
herself
early
near
the
foundry
where
she
know
Jem
work
;
he
stay
later
than
usual
,
be
detain
by
some
arrangement
for
the
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
She
grow
tired
and
impatient
;
many
workman
have
come
out
of
the
door
in
the
long
,
dead
,
brick
wall
,
and
eagerly
have
she
peer
into
their
face
,
deaf
to
all
insult
or
curse
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
have
go
home
early
;
one
more
turn
in
the
street
,
and
she
would
go
.
  
<EOS>
during
that
turn
he
come
out
,
and
in
the
quiet
of
that
street
of
workshop
and
warehouse
,
she
directly
hear
his
step
.
 
<EOS>
how
her
heart
fail
her
for
an
instant
!
<EOS>
but
still
she
be
not
daunt
from
her
purpose
,
painful
as
its
fulfilment
be
sure
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
She
lay
her
hand
on
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
as
she
expect
,
after
a
momentary
glance
at
the
person
who
thus
endeavour
to
detain
him
,
he
make
an
effort
to
shake
it
off
,
and
pass
on
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
tremble
as
she
be
,
she
have
provide
against
this
by
a
firm
and
unusual
grasp
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
listen
to
me
,
Jem
Wilson

"
she
say
,
with
almost
an
accent
of
command

<EOS>
"

nought

<EOS>
He
make
another
struggle

<EOS>
"
You
must
listen

she
say
again
,
authoritatively
,
"
for
Mary
Barton
's
sake

<EOS>
the
spell
of
her
name
be
as
potent
as
that
of

eye

exclamation

,
between
the
shame
of
acknowledge
herself
,
and
the
additional
weight
to
her
revelation
which
such
acknowledgment
would
give
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
speak
   
<EOS>
"
do
you
remember
Esther
,
the
sister
of
John
Barton
's
wife
?
<EOS>
the
aunt
to
Mary
?
 
<EOS>
and
the
valentine
I
send
you
last
February
ten
year
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
mind
her
well
!
 
<EOS>
but
yo
be
not
Esther
,
be
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
look
again
into
her
face
,
and
see
that
indeed
it
be
his
boyhood
's
friend
<EOS>
,
he
take
her
hand
,
and
shake
it
with
a
cordiality
that
forget
the
present
in
the
past
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
Esther
!
 
<EOS>
where
han
ye
be
this
many
a
year
?
 
<EOS>
where
han
ye
be
wander
that
we
none
of
us
could
find
you
out
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
question
be
ask
thoughtlessly
,
but
answer
with
fierce
earnestness
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
have
I
be
?
 
<EOS>
what
have
I
be
do
?
 
<EOS>
why
do
you
torment
me
with
question
like
these
?
 
<EOS>
Can
you
not
guess
?
 
<EOS>
but
the
story
of
my
life
be
want
to
give
force
to
my
speech
,
afterwards
I
will
tell
it
you
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
!
do
not
change
your
fickle
mind
now
,
and
say
you
do
not
want
to
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
hear
it
,
and
I
must
tell
it
;
and
then
see
after
Mary
,
and
take
care
<EOS>
she
do
not
become
like
me
.
 
<EOS>
as
she
be
love
now
,
so
do
I
love
once
:
one
above
me
far
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
remark
not
,
in
her
own
absorption
,
<EOS>
the
change
in
Jem
's
breathing
,
the
sudden
clutch
at
the
wall
which
tell
the
fearfully
vivid
interest
he
take
in
what
she
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
be
so
handsome
,
so
kind
!
 
<EOS>
well
,
the
regiment
be
order
to
Chester
<EOS>
(
do
I
tell
you
he
be
an
officer

)
,
and
he
could
not
bear
to
part
from
me
,
nor
I
from
him
,
so
he
take
me
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
think
poor
Mary
would
have
take
it
so
to
heart
!
 
<EOS>
I
always
mean
to
send
for
her
to
pay
me
a
visit
when
I
be
married
;
for
,
mark
you
!
<EOS>
he
promise
me
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
do
.
 
<EOS>
then
come
three
year
of
happiness
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
ought
not
to
have
be
happy
,
but
I
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
little
girl
,
too

<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
the
sweetest
darling
that
ever
be
see
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
not
think
of
her
,
"
put
her
hand
wildly
up
to
her
forehead
,
"
or
I
shall
go
mad
;
I
shall

"
do
not
tell
me
any
more
about
yoursel

say
Jem
soothingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
you
be
tired
already
,
be
you
?
<EOS>
but
I
will
tell
you
;
as
you
have
ask
for
it
,
you
shall
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
recall
the
agony
of
the
past
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
have
the
relief
of
tell
it

<EOS>
oh
,
how
happy
I
be
!
"
 
<EOS>
sink
her
voice
into
a
plaintive
,
childlike
manner
.
<EOS>
"
It
go
like
a
shot
through
me
when
one
day
he
come
to
me
and
tell
me
he
be
order
to
Ireland
,
and
must
leave
me
behind
;
at
Bristol
we
then
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
mutter
some
word
;
she
catch
their
meaning
,
and
in
a
plead
voice
continue
   
<EOS>
"
oh
,
do
not
abuse
him
;
do
not
speak
a
word
against
him
!
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
how
I
love
him
yet
;
<EOS>
yet
,
when
I
be
sink
so
low
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
guess
how
kind
he
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
me
fifty
pound
before
we
part
,
and
I
know
he
could
ill
spare
it
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
,
Jem
,
please
,
"
as
his
muttered
indignation
rise
again
.
 
<EOS>
for
her
sake
he
cease
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
may
have
do
better
with
the
money
;
I
see
now
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
know
the
value
of
it
then
.
 
<EOS>
formerly
I
have
earn
it
easily
enough
at
the
factory
,
and
as
I
have
no
more
sensible
want
,
I
spend
it
on
dress
and
on
eat
.
 
<EOS>
while
I
live
with
him
,
I
have
it
for
ask
;
and
fifty
pound
would
,
I
think
,
go
a
long
way
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
go
back
to
Chester
,
where
I
would
be
so
happy
,
and
set
up
a
small
-
ware
shop
,
and
hire
a
room
near
.
 
<EOS>
We
should
have
do
well
,
but
alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
my
little
girl
fall
ill
,
and
I
could
not
mind
my
shop
and
her
too
:
and
thing
grow
bad
and
bad
.
 
<EOS>
I
sell
my
good
anyhow
to
get
money
to
buy
her
food
and
medicine
;
I
write
over
and
over
again
to
her
father
for
help
,
but
he
must
have
change
his
quarter
,
for
I
never
get
an
answer
.
 
<EOS>
the
landlord
seize
the
few
bobbin
and
tape
I
have
leave
,
for
shop
-
rent
;
and
the
person
to
whom
the
mean
little
room
,
to
which
we
have
be
force
to
remove
,
belong
,
threaten
to
turn
us
out
unless
his
rent
be
pay
;
it
have
run
on
many
week
,
and
it
be
winter
,
cold
bleak
winter
;
and
my
child
be
so
ill
,
so
ill
,
and
I
be
starve
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
could
not
bear
to
see
her
suffer
,
and
forget
how
much
well
it
would
be
for
us
to
die
together
;
 
<EOS>
oh
,
her
moan
,
her
moan
,
which
money
could
give
the
mean
of
relieve
!
 
<EOS>
so
I
go
out
into
the
street
one
January
night
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
God
will
punish
me
for
that
?
<EOS>
"
she
ask
with
wild
vehemence
,
almost
amount
to
insanity
,
and
shake
Jem
's
arm
in
order
to
force
an
answer
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
before
he
could
shape
his
heart
's
sympathy
into
word
,
her
voice
have
lose
its
wildness
,
and
she
speak
with
the
quiet
of
despair
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
it
be
no
matter
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
do
that
since
,
which
separate
us
as
far
asunder
as
heaven
and
hell
can
be

<EOS>
Her
voice
rise
again
to
the
sharp
pitch
of
agony
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
darling
!
<EOS>
my
darling
!
<EOS>
even
after
death
I
may
not

thee

one

she
be
so
good
 
<EOS>
like
a
little
angel

what
be
that
text

I
do
not
remember
,
 
the
text
mother
use
to
teach
me
when
I
sit
on
her
knee
long
ago
;
it
begin

bless

"
Blessed
be
the
pure

they
shall
see
God

ay

that

It
would
break
mother

heart

I
be

it
do
break
Mary
's
heart

,
you
see

and
now
I
recollect
it
be
about
her
child
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
you

Jem

You
know
Mary
Barton
,
do
not
you

say
she
,
try
to
collect
her
thought

<EOS>
yes
,
Jem
know
her
.
 
<EOS>
how
well
,
his
beat
heart
could
testify
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
there
be
something
to
do
for
her
;
I
forget
what
;
wait
a
minute
!
 
<EOS>
She
be
so
like
my
little
girl

"
say
she
,
raise
her
eye
glisten
with
unshed
tear
,
in
search
of
the
sympathy
of
Jem
's
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
He
deeply
pity
her
;
but
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
he
long
to
recall
her
mind
to
the
subject
of
Mary
,
and
the
lover
above
her
in
rank
,
and
the
service
to
be
do
for
her
sake
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
control
himself
to
silence
.
 
<EOS>
after
awhile
,
she
speak
again
,
and
in
a
calm
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
I
come
to
Manchester
(
for
I
could
not
stay
in
Chester
after
her
death
)
,
I
find
you
all
out
very
soon
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
never
think
my
poor
sister
be
dead
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
would
not
think
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
use
to
watch
about
the
court
where
John
live
,
for
many
and
many
a
night
,
and
gather
all
I
could
about
them
from
the
neighbour
'
talk
;
for
I
never
ask
a
question
.
 
<EOS>
I
put
this
and
that
together
,
and
follow
one
,
and
listen
to
another
;
many
be
the
time
I
have
watch
the
policeman
off
his
beat
,
and
peep
through
the
chink
of
the
window
-
shutter
to
see
the
old
room
,
and
sometimes
Mary
or
her
father
sit
up
late
for
some
reason
or
another
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
out
Mary
go
to
learn
dressmake
,
and
<EOS>
I
begin
to
be
frightened
for
her
;
for
it
be
a
bad
life
for
a
girl
to
be
out
late
at
night
in
the
street
,
and
after
many
an
hour
of
weary
work
,
they
be
ready
to
follow
after
any
novelty
that
make
a
little
change
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
make
up
my
mind
,
that
bad
as
I
be
<EOS>
,
I
could
watch
over
Mary
,
and
perhaps
keep
her
from
harm
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
use
to
wait
for
her
at
night
,
and
follow
her
home
,
often
when
she
little
know
any
one
be
near
her
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
of
her
companion
I
never
could
abide
,
and
I
be
sure
that
girl
be
at
the
bottom
of
some
mischief
.
 
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
by
Mary
's
walk
homeward
be
not
alone
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
join
soon
after
she
come
out
by
a
man
;
a
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
fear
for
her
,
for
I
see
she
be
light
-
hearted
,
and
please
with
his
attention
;
and
I
think
bad
of
him
for
have
such
long
talk
with
that
bold
girl
<EOS>
I
tell
you
of
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
lay
up
for
a
long
time
with
spitting
of
blood
;
and
could
do
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
it
make
make
me
bad
,
think
about
what
may
be
happen
to
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
come
out
,
all
be
go
on
as
before
,
only
she
seem
fonder
of
him
than
ever
;
and
oh
!
<EOS>
Jem
,
her
father
will
not
listen
to
me
,
and
it
be
you
must
save
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
You
be
like
a
brother
to
her
,
and
maybe
could
give
her
advice
and
watch
over
her
,
and
at
any
rate
John
will
hearken
to
you
;
only
he
be
so
stern
,
and
so
cruel
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
begin
to
cry
a
little
at
the
remembrance
of
his
harsh
word
;
but
Jem
cut
her
short
by
his
hoarse
,
stern
inquiry
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
who
be
this
spark
that
Mary
love
?
 
<EOS>
tell
me
his
name
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
young
Carson
,
old
Carson
's
son
,
that
your
father
work
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
pause
.
 
<EOS>
She
break
the
silence
   
<EOS>
"
O
Jem
,
I
charge
you
with
the
care
of
her
!
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
would
be
murder
to
kill
her
,
but
it
would
be
well
for
her
to
die
than
to
live
to
lead
such
a
life
as
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
hear
me
,
Jem
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
I
hear
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
well
.
 
<EOS>
better
we
be
all
dead
.
<EOS>
"
this
be
say
as
if
think
aloud
;
but
he
immediately
change
his
tone
and
continue
   
<EOS>
"
esther
,
you
may
trust
to
my
do
all
I
can
for
Mary

<EOS>
that
I
have

<EOS>
and
now
listen
to
me

<EOS>
You
loathe
the
life

else
you
would
not
speak
of
it
as
you
do

come
home
with

<EOS>
come
to
my

She

my

Alice

I
will
see
that
they
give
you

I
will

She
be
silent
for
a
minute

and
he
hope
he
have
gain
his
point
.

then
she
say

with
accent

his
hold

still
seem
inclined
to
urge
her

must
have
drink

glare
round
with
terrified
eye

as

dread

some
spiritual
creature

with
dim
form

<EOS>
"
It
be
so
frightful
to
see
them
,

whisper
in
tone
of
wildness

although
so
low
spoken

<EOS>
"
there
they
go
round
and
round
my
bed
the
whole
night
through
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
,
carry
little
Annie
(
I
wonder
how
they
get
together
)
and
Mary
 
and
all
look
at
me
with
their
sad
,
stony
eye
;
o
Jem
!
<EOS>
it
be
so
terrible
!
 
<EOS>
They
do
not
turn
back
either
,
but
pass
behind
the
head
of
the
bed
,
and
I
feel
their
eye
on
me
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
creep
under
the
clothe
I
still
see
them
;
and
what
be
bad
,
"
hiss
out
her
word
with
fright
,
"
they
see
me
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
speak
to
me
of
lead
a
well
life
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
drink
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
pass
to
-
night
without
a
dram
;
I
dare
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
be
silent
from
deep
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
could
he
,
then
,
do
nothing
for
her
!
 
<EOS>
She
speak
again
,
but
in
a
less
excited
tone
,
although
it
be
thrillingly
earnest
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
grieve
for
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
it
better
than
if
you
tell
me
in
word

<EOS>
but
you
can
do
nothing
for
me

<EOS>
I
be
past
hope

<EOS>
You
can
yet
save
Mary

<EOS>
You
must

<EOS>
She
be
innocent
,
except
for
the
great
error
of
love
one
above
her
in
station

<EOS>
Jem
!
<EOS>
you
WILL
save
her

<EOS>
with
heart
and
soul
,
though
in

word

Jem
promise
that
if
aught
earthly
could
keep
her
from
fall
,
he
would
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
bless
him
,
and
bade
him
good
-
night

<EOS>
"
stay
a
minute
,
"
say
he
,
as

on
the
point

departure

I
may
want
to
speak
to
you
again

She
laugh
strangely

"
and
do
you
think
one
sink
so
low

I

<EOS>
decent
,
good
people
have
home

<EOS>
We
have
none

<EOS>
no

if
you
want
me
,
come
at
night
and
look
at
the
corner
of
the
street
about
here

<EOS>
the
cold
,
the
bleaker

the
more
stormy
the
night

the
more
certain
you
will
be
to
find
me

for
then
,

she
add
,
with
a
plaintive
fall
in
her
voice
,
"
it
be
so
cold
sleeping
in
entry
,
and
on
door

step
,
and
I
want
a
dram
more
than
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
again
she
rapidly
turn
off
,
and
Jem
also
go
on
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
but
before
he
reach
the
end
of
the
street
,
even
in
the
midst
of
the
jealous
anguish
that
fill
his
heart
,
his
conscience
smote
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
do
enough
to
save
her
.
 
<EOS>
one
more
effort
,
and
she
may
have
come
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
twenty
effort
would
have
be
well
reward
by
her
yielding
.
 
<EOS>
He
turn
back
,
but
she
be
go
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
tumult
of
his
other
feeling
,
his
self
-
reproach
be
deaden
for
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
but
many
and
many
a
day
afterwards
he
bitterly
regret
his
omission
of
duty
;
his
weariness
of
well
-
doing
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
the
great
thing
be
to
reach
home
,
and
solitude
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
love
another
!
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
should
he
bear
it
?
 
<EOS>
He
have
think
her
rejection
of
him
a
hard
trial
,
but
that
be
nothing
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
only
remember
it
,
to
be
thankful
that
he
have
not
yield
to
the
temptation
of
try
his
fate
again
,
not
in
actual
word
,
but
in
a
meeting
,
where
her
manner
should
tell
far
more
than
word
,
that
her
sweet
smile
,
her
dainty
movement
,
her
pretty
household
way
,
be
all
to
be
reserve
to
gladden
another
's
eye
and
heart
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
must
live
on
;
that
seem
the
strange
.
 
<EOS>
that
a
long
life
(
and
he
know
man
do
live
long
,
even
with
deep
,
bite
sorrow
corrode
at
their
heart
)
must
be
spend
without
Mary
;
nay
,
with
the
consciousness
<EOS>
she
be
another
's
!
 
<EOS>
that
hell
of
thought
he
would
reserve
for
the
quiet
of
his
own
room
,
the
dead
stillness
of
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
on
the
threshold
of
home
now

<EOS>
He
enter
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
usual
face
,
the
usual
sight
.
 
<EOS>
He
loathe
them
,
and
then
he
curse
himself
because
he
loathe
them
.
<EOS>
His
mother
's
love
have
take
a
cross
turn
,
because
he
have
keep
the
tempt
supper
she
have
prepare
for
him
wait
until
it
be
nearly
spoilt
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
,
her
dull
sense
deaden
day
by
day
,
sit
mutely
near
the
fire
:
<EOS>
her
happiness
bound
by
the
consciousness
of
the
presence
of
her
foster
-
child
,
know
that
his
voice
repeat
what
be
pass
to
her
deafen
ear
,
that
his
arm
remove
each
little
obstacle
to
her
totter
step
.
 
<EOS>
and
Will
,
out
of
the
very
kindness
of
his
heart
,
talk
more
and
more
merrily
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
Jem
be
downcast
,
and
fancy
his
rattling
may
cheer
him
;
at
any
rate
,
it
drown
his
aunt
's
muttered
grumbling
,
and
in
some
measure
conceal
the
blank
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
bed
-
time
come
;
and
Will
withdrew
to
his
neighbouring
lodging
;
and
Jane
and
Alice
Wilson
have
rake
the
fire
,
and
fasten
door
and
shutter
,
and
patter
upstairs
,
with
their
totter
footstep
and
shrill
voice
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
,
too
,
go
to
the
closet
term
his
bedroom
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
bolt
to
the
door
;
but
by
one
strong
effort
of
his
right
arm
a
heavy
chest
be
move
against
it
,
and
he
could
sit
down
on
the
side
of
his
bed
,
and
think
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
love
another
!
 
<EOS>
that
idea
would
rise
uppermost
in
his
mind
,
and
have
to
be
combat
in
all
its
form
of
pain
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
,
perhaps
,
no
great
wonder
that
she
should
prefer
one
so
much
above
Jem
in
the
external
thing
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
gentleman
;
why
do
he
,
with
his
range
of
choice
among
the
lady
of
the
land
,
why
do
he
stoop
down
to
carry
off
the
poor
man
's
darling
?
 
<EOS>
with
all
the
glory
of
the
garden
at
his
hand
,
why
do
he
prefer
to
cull
the
wild
-
rise
,
 
Jem
's
own
fragrant
wild
-
rose
?
  
<EOS>
His
own
!
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
never
now
his
own
!
 
<EOS>
go
for
evermore
.
  
<EOS>
then
uprose
the
guilty
longing
for
blood
!
 
<EOS>
the
frenzy
of
jealousy
!
 
<EOS>
some
one
should
die
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
rather
Mary
be
dead
,
cold
in
her
grave
,
than
that
she
be
another
's
.
 
<EOS>
a
vision
of
her
pale
,
sweet
face
,
with
her
bright
hair
all
bedabble
with
gore
,
seem
to
float
constantly
before
his
ache
eye
.
 
<EOS>
but
her
be
ever
open
,
and
contain
,
in
their
soft
,
deathly
look
,
such
mute
reproach
!
 
<EOS>
what
have
she
do
to
deserve
such
cruel
treatment
from
him
?
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
woo
by
one
whom
Jem
know
to
be
handsome
,
gay
,
and
bright
,
and
she
have
give
him
her
love
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
wooer
who
should
die
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
die
,
know
the
cause
of
his
death
.
<EOS>
Jem
picture
him
(
and
gloat
on
the
picture
)
,
lie
smitten
,
yet
conscious
;
and
listen
to
the
upbraid
accusation
of
his
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
how
he
have
leave
his
own
rank
,
and
dare
to
love
a
maiden
of
low
degree
!
<EOS>
and
oh
!
stinging
agony
of
all
 
how
she
,
in
return
,
have
love
him
!
 
<EOS>
then
the
other
nature
speak
up
,
and
bade
him
<EOS>
remember
the
anguish
he
should
so
prepare
for
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
at
first
he
refuse
to
listen
to
that
well
voice
;
or
listen
only
to
pervert
.
<EOS>
He
would
glory
in
her
wail
grief
!
<EOS>
he
would
take
pleasure
in
her
desolation
of
heart
!
  
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
he
could
not
,
say
the
still
small
voice
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
bad
,
far
bad
,
to
have
cause
such
woe
,
than
it
be
now
to
bear
his
present
heavy
burden
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
too
heavy
,
too
grievous
to
be
bear
,
and
live
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
slay
himself
and
the
lover
should
love
on
,
and
the
sun
shine
bright
,
and
he
with
his
burning
,
woeful
heart
would
be
at
rest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
rest
that
be
reserve
for
the
people
of
God
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
have
he
not
promise
,
with
such
earnest
purpose
of
soul
as
make
word
more
solemn
than
oath
,
to
save
Mary
from
become
such
as
Esther
?
 
<EOS>
Should
he
shrink
from
the
duty
of
life
,
into
the
cowardliness
of
death
?
 
<EOS>
who
would
then
guard
Mary
,
with
her
love
and
her
innocence
?
 
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
a
goodly
thing
to
serve
her
,
although
she
love
him
not
;
to
be
her
preserve
angel
,
through
the
peril
of
life
;
and
she
,
unconscious
all
the
while
?
  
<EOS>
He
brace
up
his
soul
,
and
say
to
himself
,
that
with
God
's
help
he
would
be
that
earthly
keeper
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
the
mist
and
the
storm
seem
clear
away
from
his
path
,
though
it
still
be
full
of
stinging
thorn
.
 
<EOS>
have
do
the
duty
near
to
him
(
of
reduce
the
tumult
of
his
own
heart
to
something
like
order
)
,
the
second
become
more
plain
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Esther
's
experience
have
lead
her
,
perhaps
too
hastily
,
to
the
conclusion
that
Mr.
Carson
's
intention
be
evil
towards
Mary
;
at
least
she
have
give
no
just
ground
for
the
fear
she
entertain
<EOS>
that
such
be
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
possible
,
nay
,
to
Jem
's
heart
very
probable
,
that
he
may
only
be
too
happy
to
marry
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
a
lady
by
right
of
nature
,
<EOS>
Jem
think
;
in
movement
,
grace
,
and
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
birth
to
a
Manchester
manufacturer
,
many
of
whom
glory
,
and
justly
too
,
in
be
the
architect
of
their
own
fortune
?
 
<EOS>
and
,
as
far
as
wealth
be
concern
,
judge
another
by
himself
,
Jem
could
only
imagine
it
a
great
privilege
to
lay
it
at
the
foot
of
the
love
one
.
 
<EOS>
Harry
Carson
's
mother
have
be
a
factory
girl
;
<EOS>
so
,
after
all
,
what
be
the
great
reason
for
doubt
his
intention
towards
Mary
?
  
<EOS>
there
may
probably
be
some
little
awkwardness
about
the
affair
at
first
;
Mary
's
father
have
such
strong
prejudice
on
the
one
hand
;
and
something
of
the
same
kind
be
likely
to
exist
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Carson
's
family
.
 
<EOS>
but
Jem
know
he
have
power
over
John
Barton
's
mind
;
and
it
would
be
something
to
exert
that
power
in
promote
Mary
's
happiness
,
and
to
relinquish
all
thought
of
self
in
so
do
.
  
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
why
have
Esther
choose
him
for
this
office
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
beyond
his
strength
to
act
rightly
!
 
<EOS>
why
have
she
single
him
out
?
  
<EOS>
the
answer
come
when
he
be
calm
enough
to
listen
for
it
:
because
Mary
have
no
other
friend
capable
of
the
duty
require
of
him
;
the
duty
of
a
brother
,
as
Esther
imagine
him
to
be
in
feeling
,
from
his
long
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
be
unto
her
as
a
brother
.
  
<EOS>
as
such
,
he
ought
to
ascertain
Harry
Carson
's
intention
towards
her
in
win
her
affection
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
ask
him
straightforwardly
,
as
become
man
speak
to
man
,
not
conceal
,
if
need
be
,
the
interest
he
feel
in
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
with
the
resolve
to
do
his
duty
to
the
good
of
his
power
,
peace
come
into
his
soul
;
he
have
leave
the
windy
storm
and
temp
behind
.
  
<EOS>
two
hour
before
day
-
dawn
he
fall
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
a
violent
meeting
between
the
RIVALS
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
thoughtful
heart
can
look
into
this
gulf
<EOS>
that
darkly
yawn
'
twixt
rich
and
poor
,
and
not
find
food
for
sad
meditation
!
<EOS>
Can
see

without

keen
grief

Them
fiercely

where

shall
bridge
this

<EOS>
We
must
return
to
John
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
John
!
 
<EOS>
He
never
get
over
his
disappointing
journey
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
the
deep
mortification
he
then
experience
(
with
,
perhaps
,
as
little
selfishness
for
its
cause
as
mortification
ever
have
)
be
of
no
temporary
nature
;
indeed
,
few
of
his
feeling
be
.
  
<EOS>
then
come
a
long
period
of
bodily
privation
;
of
daily
hunger
after
food
;
and
though
he
try
to
persuade
himself
he
could
bear
want
himself
with
stoical
indifference
,
and
do
care
about
it
as
little
as
most
man
,
yet
the
body
take
its
revenge
for
its
uneasy
feeling
.
<EOS>
the
mind
become
sour

morose

and
lose
much
of
its
equipoise

<EOS>
It
be
no
longer
elastic
,
as
in
the
day
of
youth
,
or
in
time
of
comparative
happiness
;
it
cease
to
hope

<EOS>
and
it
be
hard
to
live
on
when
one
can
no
longer
hope

the
same
state
of
feeling
which
John
Barton
entertain
,
if
belong
to
one
who
have
have
leisure
to
think
of
such
thing
,
and
physician
to
give
name
to
them
,
would
have
be
call
monomania
;
so
haunting
,
so
incessant
,
be
the
thought
that
press
upon
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
somewhere
read
a
forcibly
describe
punishment
among
the
Italians
,
worthy
of
a
Borgia
.
 
<EOS>
the
supposed
or
real
criminal
be
shut
up
in
a
room
,
supply
with
every
convenience
and
luxury
;
and
at
first
mourn
little
over
his
imprisonment
.
 
<EOS>
but
day
by
day
he
become
aware
that
the
space
between
the
wall
of
his
apartment
be
narrow
,
and
then
he
understand
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
those
paint
wall
would
come
into
hideous
nearness
,
and
at
last
crush
the
life
out
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
day
by
day
,
nearer
and
nearer
,
come
the
disease
thought
of
John
Barton
.
 
<EOS>
They
exclude
the
light
of
heaven
,
the
cheer
sound
of
earth
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
prepare
his
death
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
much
of
their
morbid
power
may
be
ascribe
to
the
use
of
opium
.
 
<EOS>
but
before
you
blame
too
harshly
this
use
,
or
rather
abuse
,
try
a
hopeless
life
,
with
daily
craving
of
the
body
for
food
.
 
<EOS>
try
,
not
alone
be
without
hope
yourself
,
but
see
all
around
you
reduce
to
the
same
despair
,
arise
from
the
same
circumstance
;
all
around
you
tell
(
though
they
use
no
word
or
language
)
,
by
their
look
and
feeble
action
,
that
they
be
suffer
and
sink
under
the
pressure
of
want
.
 
<EOS>
Would
you
not
be
glad
to
forget
life
,
and
its
burden
?
 
<EOS>
and
opium
give
forgetfulness
for
a
time
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
they
who
thus
purchase
it
pay
dearly
for
their
oblivion
;
but
can
you
expect
the
uneducated
to
count
the
cost
of
their
whistle
?
 
<EOS>
poor
wretch
!
 
<EOS>
They
pay
a
heavy
price
.
 
<EOS>
day
of
oppressive
weariness
and
languor
,
whose
reality
have
the
feeble
sickliness
of
dream
<EOS>
;
night
,
whose
dream
be
fierce
reality
of
agony
;
sink
health
,
totter
frame
,
incipient
madness
,
and
bad
,
the
CONSCIOUSNESS
of
incipient
madness
;
this
be
the
price
of
their
whistle
.
 
<EOS>
but
have
you
teach
them
the
science
of
consequence
?
  
<EOS>
John
Barton
's
overpower
thought
,
which
be
to
work
out
his
fate
on
earth
,
be
rich
and
poor
;
why
be
they
so
separate
<EOS>
,
so
distinct
,
when
God
have
make
them
all
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
His
will
that
their
interest
be
so
far
apart
.
 
<EOS>
whose
do
be
it
?
  
<EOS>
and
so
on
into
the
problem
and
mystery
of
life
,
until
,
bewilder
and
lost
,
unhappy
and
suffering
,
the
only
feeling
that
remain
clear
and
undisturbed
in
the
tumult
of
his
heart
,
be
hatre
to
the
one
class
,
and
keen
sympathy
with
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
avail
his
sympathy
?
 
<EOS>
no
education
have
give
him
wisdom
;
and
without
wisdom
,
even
love
,
with
all
its
effect
,
too
often
work
but
harm
.
 
<EOS>
He
act
to
the
good
of
his
judgment
,
but
it
be
a
widely
-
err
judgment
.
  
<EOS>
the
action
of
the
uneducated
seem
to
me
typified
in
those
of
Frankenstein
,
that
monster
of
many
human
quality
,
ungifte
with
a
soul
,
a
knowledge
of
the
difference
between
good
and
evil
.
  
<EOS>
the
people
rise
up
to
life
;
they
irritate
us
,
they
terrify
us
,
and
we
become
their
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
in
the
sorrowful
moment
of
our
triumphant
power
,
their
eye
gaze
on
us
with
mute
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
why
have
we
make
them
what
they
be
;
a
powerful
monster
,
yet
without
the
inner
mean
for
peace
and
happiness
?
  
<EOS>
John
Barton
become
a
Chartist
,
a
Communist
,
all
that
be
commonly
call
wild
and
visionary
.
 
<EOS>
ay
!
<EOS>
but
be
visionary
be
something
.
<EOS>
It
show
a
soul
,
a
being
not
altogether
sensual
;
a
creature
who
look
forward
for
other
,
if
not
for
himself
.
  
<EOS>
and
with
all
his
weakness
he
have
a
sort
of
practical
power
,
which
make
him
useful
to
the
body
of
man
to
whom
he
belong
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
ready
kind
of
rough
Lancashire
eloquence
,
arise
out
of
the
fulness
of
his
heart
,
which
be
very
stirring
to
man
similarly
circumstance
,
who
like
to
hear
their
feeling
put
into
word
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
pretty
clear
head
at
time
,
for
method
and
arrangement
;
a
necessary
talent
to
large
combination
of
man
.
 
<EOS>
and
what
perhaps
more
than
all
make
him
relied
upon
and
value
,
be
the
consciousness
which
every
one
who
come
in
contact
with
him
feel
,
that
he
be
actuate
by
no
selfish
motive
;
that
his
class
,
his
order
,
be
what
he
stand
by
,
not
the
right
of
his
own
paltry
self
.
 
<EOS>
for
even
in
great
and
noble
man
,
as
soon
as
self
come
into
prominent
existence
,
it
become
a
mean
and
paltry
thing
.
  
<EOS>
a
little
time
before
this
,
there
have
come
one
of
those
occasion
for
deliberation
among
the
employ
,
which
deeply
interested
John
Barton
,
and
the
discussion
concern
which
have
cause
his
frequent
absence
from
home
of
late
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
if
I
can
express
myself
in
the
technical
term
of
either
master
or
workman
,
but
I
will
try
simply
to
state
the
case
on
which
the
latter
deliberate
.
  
<EOS>
an
order
for
coarse
good
come
in
from
a
new
foreign
market
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
large
order
,
give
employment
to
all
the
mill
engage
in
that
specie
of
manufacture
;
but
it
be
necessary
to
execute
it
speedily
,
and
at
as
low
price
as
possible
,
as
the
master
have
reason
to
believe
that
a
duplicate
order
have
be
send
to
one
of
the
continental
manufacturing
town
,
where
there
be
no
restriction
on
food
,
no
taxis
on
building
or
machinery
,
and
where
consequently
they
dread
that
the
good
could
be
make
at
a
much
low
price
than
they
could
afford
them
for
;
and
that
,
by
so
act
and
charge
,
the
rival
manufacturer
would
obtain
undivided
possession
of
the
market
.
<EOS>
It
be
clearly
their
interest
to
buy
cotton
as
cheaply
,
and
to
beat
down
wage
as
low
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
the
long
run
the
interest
of
the
workman
would
have
be
thereby
benefit
.
 
<EOS>
distrust
each
other
as
they
may
,
the
employer
and
the
employed
must
rise
or
fall
together
.
 
<EOS>
there
may
be
some
difference
as
to
chronology
,
none
as
to
fact
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
master
do
not
choose
to
make
all
these
circumstance
know
.
 
<EOS>
They
stand
upon
be
the
master
,
and
that
they
have
a
right
to
order
work
at
their
own
price
,
and
they
believe
that
in
the
present
depression
of
trade
,
and
unemployment
of
hand
,
there
would
be
no
great
difficulty
in
get
it
do
.
  
<EOS>
now
let
us
turn
to
the
workman
's
view
of
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
the
master
(
of
the
totter
foundation
of
whose
prosperity
they
be
ignorant
)
seem
do
well
,
and
,
like
gentleman
,
"
live
at
home
in
ease
,
"
while
they
be
starve
,
gasp
on
from
day
to
day
;
and
there
be
a
foreign
order
to
be
execute
,
the
extent
of
which
,
large
as
it
be
,
be
greatly
exaggerated
;
and
it
be
to
be
do
speedily
.
 
<EOS>
why
be
the
master
offer
such
low
wage
under
these
circumstance
?
<EOS>
shame
upon
them
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
take
advantage
of
their
workpeople
be
almost
starve
;
but
they
would
starve
entirely
rather
than
come
into
such
term
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
bad
enough
to
be
poor
,
while
by
the
labour
of
their
thin
hand
,
the
sweat
of
their
brow
,
the
master
be
make
rich
;
but
they
would
not
be
utterly
grind
down
to
dust
.
 
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
they
would
fold
their
hand
and
sit
idle
,
and
smile
at
the
master
,
whom
even
in
death
they
could
baffle
.
 
<EOS>
with
spartan
endurance
they
determine
to
let
the
employer
know
their
power
,
by
refuse
to
work
.
  
<EOS>
so
class
distrust
class
,
and
their
want
of
mutual
confidence
work
sorrow
to
both
.
 
<EOS>
the
master
would
not
be
bully
,
and
compel
to
reveal
why
they
feel
it
wisest
and
good
to
offer
only
such
low
wage
;
they
would
not
be
make
to
tell
that
they
be
even
sacrifice
capital
to
obtain
a
decisive
victory
over
the
continental
manufacturer
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
workman
sit
silent
and
stern
with
fold
hand
,
refuse
to
work
for
such
pay
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
strike
in
Manchester
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
it
be
succeed
by
the
usual
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
many
other
Trades
'
union
,
connect
with
different
branch
of
business
,
support
with
money
,
countenance
,
and
encouragement
of
every
kind
,
the
stand
which
the
Manchester
power
-
loom
weaver
be
make
against
their
master
.
 
<EOS>
delegate
from
Glasgow
,
from
Nottingham
,
and
other
town
,
be
send
to
Manchester
,
to
keep
up
the
spirit
of
resistance
;
a
committee
be
form
,
and
all
the
requisite
officer
elect
;
chairman
,
treasurer
,
honorary
secretary
;
 
among
them
be
John
Barton
.
  
<EOS>
the
master
,
meanwhile
,
take
their
measure
.
 
<EOS>
They
placard
the
wall
with
advertisement
for
power
-
loom
weaver
.
 
<EOS>
the
workman
reply
by
a
placard
in
still
large
letter
,
state
their
grievance
.
 
<EOS>
the
master
meet
daily
in
town
,
to
mourn
over
the
time
(
so
fast
slip
away
)
for
the
fulfilment
of
the
foreign
order
;
and
to
strengthen
each
other
in
their
resolution
not
to
yield
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
give
up
now
,
they
may
give
up
always
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
never
do
.
<EOS>
and
amongst
the
most
energetic
of
the
master
,
the
Carsons
,
father
and
son
,
take
their
place
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
well
know
,
that
there
be
no
religionist
so
zealous
as
a
convert
;
no
master
so
stern
,
and
regardless
of
the
interest
of
their
workpeople
,
as
those
who
have
rise
from
such
a
station
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
this
would
account
for
the
eld
Mr.
Carson
's
determination
not
to
be
bully
into
yield
;
not
even
to
be
bully
into
give
reason
for
act
as
the
master
do
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
employer
'
will
,
and
that
should
be
enough
for
the
employ
.
 
<EOS>
Harry
Carson
do
not
trouble
himself
much
about
the
ground
for
his
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
He
like
the
excitement
of
the
affair
.
 
<EOS>
He
like
the
attitude
of
resistance
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
brave
,
and
he
like
the
idea
of
personal
danger
,
with
which
some
of
the
more
cautious
try
to
intimidate
the
violent
among
the
master
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
power
-
loom
weaver
live
in
the
more
remote
part
of
Lancashire
,
and
the
neighbouring
county
,
hear
of
the
master
'
advertisement
for
workman
;
and
in
their
solitary
dwelling
grow
weary
of
starvation
,
and
resolve
to
come
to
Manchester

<EOS>
Foot

they

they

in

early
dawn
,
before
people
be
astir
,
or
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
begin
the
real
wrong
-
doing
of
the
Trades
'
Unions
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
their
decision
to
work
,
or
not
,
at
such
a
particular
rate
of
wage
,
that
be
either
wise
or
unwise
;
all
error
of
judgment
at
the
bad
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
have
no
right
to
tyrannise
over
other
,
and
tie
them
down
to
their
own
procrustean
bed
.
 
<EOS>
abhor
what
they
consider
oppression
in
the
master
,
why
do
they
oppress
other
?
 
<EOS>
because
,
when
man
get
excited
,
they
know
not
what
they
do
.
<EOS>
Judge
,
then
,
with
something
of
the
mercy
of
the
Holy
One
,
whom
we
all
love
.
  
<EOS>
in
spite
of
policeman
set
to
watch
over
the
safety
of
the
poor
country
weaver
 
in
spite
of
magistrate
,
and
prison
,
and
severe
punishment
 
<EOS>
the
poor
depressed
man
tramp
in
from
Burnley
,
Padiham
,
and
other
place
,
to
work
at
the
condemned
"
Starvation
price
,
"
be
waylaid
,
and
beat
,
and
leave
by
the
roadside
almost
for
dead
.
 
<EOS>
the
police
break
up
every
lounge
knot
of
man
:
 
<EOS>
they
separate
quietly
,
to
reunite
half
-
a
-
mile
out
of
town
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
the
feeling
between
the
master
and
workman
do
not
improve
under
these
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
combination
be
an
awful
power
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
like
the
equally
mighty
agency
of
steam
;
capable
of
almost
unlimited
good
or
evil
.
 
<EOS>
but
to
obtain
a
blessing
on
its
labour
,
it
must
work
under
the
direction
of
a
high
and
intelligent
will
;
incapable
of
be
mislead
by
passion
or
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
the
will
of
the

not

to
the
calmness
of

<EOS>
so
much
for
generality
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
now
return
to
individual
.
  
<EOS>
a
note
,
respectfully
word

although
its
tone
of
determination
be
strong
,
have
be
send
by
the
power

,
request
that
a
"
deputation
"
of
them
may
have
a
meeting
with
the
master
,
to
state
the
condition
they
must
have
fulfil
before
they
would
end
the
turn

out

<EOS>
They
think
they
have

a
sufficiently
command
position
to
dictate
.
 
<EOS>
John
Barton
be
appoint
one
of
the
deputation

<EOS>
the
master
agree
to
this
meeting
,
be
anxious
to
end
the
strife
,
although
undetermined
among
themselves
how
far
they
should
yield
,
or
whether
they
should
yield
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
the
old

whose
experience
have
teach
them
sympathy
,
be
for
concession
.
 
<EOS>
Others

white

have
only
learn
hardness
and
obstinacy
from
the
day
of
the
year
of
their
life
,
and
sneer
at
the
more
gentle

yielding

<EOS>
the
young
man
be
one
and
all
for
an
unflinching
resistance
to
claim

with
so
much
violence
.
 
<EOS>
of
this
party
<EOS>
Harry

be
the

<EOS>
but
like
all
energetic
people

the
more
he

do
the
more

he
seem
to
find
.
 
<EOS>
with
all
his
letter
-
writing
,
his
calling
,
his
be
present
at
the
New
Bailey
,
when
investigation
of
any
case
of
violence
against
knob
-
stick
*
be
go
on
,
he
beset
Mary
more
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
weary
of
her
life
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
from
blandishment
he
have
even
go
to
threat
 
threat
that
whether
she
would
or
not
she
should
be
his
;
he
show
an
indifference
that
be
most
insulting
to
everything
which
may
attract
attention
and
injure
her
character
.
     
<EOS>
and
still
she
never
see
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
She
know
he
have
return
home
.
 
<EOS>
She
hear
of
him
occasionally
through
his
cousin
,
who
rove
gaily
from
house
to
house
,
find
and
make
friend
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
never
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
she
to
think
?
 
<EOS>
have
he
give
her
up
?
 
<EOS>
be
a
few
hasty
word
,
speak
in
a
moment
of
irritation
,
to
stamp
her
lot
through
life
?
 
<EOS>
at
time
she
think
that
she
could
bear
this
meekly
,
happy
in
her
own
constant
power
of
loving
.
 
<EOS>
for
of
change
or
of
forgetfulness
<EOS>
she
do
not
dream
.
 
<EOS>
then
at
other
time
her
state
of
impatience
be
such
,
that
it
require
all
her
self
-
restraint
to
prevent
her
from
go
and
seek
him
out
,
and
(
as
man
would
do
to
man
,
or
woman
to
woman
)
beg
him
to
forgive
her
hasty
word
,
and
allow
her
to
retract
them
,
and
bid
him
accept
of
the
love
that
be
fill
her
whole
heart
.
 
<EOS>
She
wish
Margaret
have
not
advise
her
against
such
a
manner
of
proceeding
;
she
believe
it
be
her
friend
's
word
that
seem
to
make
such
a
simple
action
impossible
,
in
spite
of
all
the
internal
urging
.
 
<EOS>
but
a
friend
's
advice
be
only
thus
powerful
,
when
it
put
into
language
the
secret
oracle
of
our
soul
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
whispering
of
her
womanly
nature
that
cause
her
to
shrink
from
any
unmaidenly
action
,
not
Margaret
's
counsel
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
time
,
this
ten
day
or
so
,
of
Will
's
visit
to
Manchester
,
there
be
something
go
on
which
interested
Mary
even
now
,
and
which
,
in
former
time
,
would
have
exceedingly
amuse
and
excite
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
see
as
clearly
as
if
tell
in
word
,
that
the
merry
,
random
,
boisterous
sailor
have
fall
deeply
in
love
with
the
quiet
,
prim
,
somewhat
plain
Margaret
:
she
doubt
if
Margaret
be
aware
of
it
,
and
yet
,
as
she
watch
more
closely
,
she
begin
to
think
some
instinct
make
the
blind
girl
feel
whose
eye
be
so
often
fix
upon
her
pale
face
;
that
some
inner
feeling
make
the
delicate
and
become
rose
-
flush
steal
over
her
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
speak
so
decidedly
as
before
;
there
be
a
hesitation
in
her
manner
,
that
seem
to
make
her
very
attractive
;
as
if
something
soft
,
more
lovable
than
excellent
sense
,
be
come
in
as
a
motive
for
speech
;
her
eye
have
always
be
soft
,
and
be
in
no
way
disfigure
by
her
blindness
,
and
now
seem
to
have
a
new
charm
,
as
they
quiver
under
their
white
,
downcast
lid
.
 
<EOS>
She
must
be
conscious
,
think
Mary
 
heart
answer
to
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Will
's
love
have
no
blushing
,
no
downcast
eye
,
no
weighing
of
word
;
it
be
as
open
and
undisguised
as
his
nature
;
yet
he
seem
afraid
of
the
answer
its
acknowledgment
may
meet
with
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Margaret
's
angelic
voice
that
have
entrance
him
,
and
which
make
him
think
of
her
as
a
being
of
some
other
sphere
,
that
he
fear
to
woo
.
<EOS>
so
he
try
to
propitiate
Job
in
all
manner
of
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
over
to
Liverpool
to
rummage
in
his
great
sea
-
chest
for
the
fly
-
fish
(
no
very
odorous
present
,
by
the
way
)
.
 
<EOS>
He
hesitate
over
a
child
's
caul
for
some
time
,
which
be
,
in
his
eye
,
a
far
great
treasure
than
any
Exocetus
.
 
<EOS>
what
use
could
it
be
of
to
a
landsman
?
 
<EOS>
then
Margaret
's
voice
ring
in
his
ear
;
and
he
determine
to
sacrifice
it
,
his
most
precious
possession
,
to
one
whom
she
love
as
she
do
her
grandfather
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
rather
a
relief
to
him
,
when
,
have
put
it
and
the
fly
-
fish
together
in
a
brown
paper
parcel
,
and
sit
upon
them
for
security
all
the
way
in
the
railroad
,
he
find
that
Job
be
so
indifferent
to
the
precious
caul
that
he
may
easily
claim
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
hang
about
Margaret
,
till
he
have
receive
many
warning
and
reproach
from
his
conscience
in
behalf
of
his
dear
aunt
Alice
's
claim
upon
his
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
away
,
and
then
he
bethink
him
of
some
other
little
word
with
Job
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
turn
back
,
and
stand
talk
once
more
in
Margaret
's
presence
,
door
in
hand
,
only
wait
for
some
little
speech
of
encouragement
to
come
in
and
sit
down
again
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
the
invitation
be
not
give
,
he
be
force
to
leave
at
last
,
and
go
and
do
his
duty
.
  
<EOS>
four
day
have
Jem
Wilson
watch
for
Mr.
Harry
Carson
without
success
;
his
hour
of
go
and
return
to
his
home
be
so
irregular
,
owe
to
the
meeting
and
consultation
among
the
master
,
which
be
render
necessary
by
the
turn
-
out
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
fifth
,
without
any
purpose
on
Jem
's
part
,
they
meet
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
workman
's
dinner
-
hour
,
the
interval
between
twelve
and
one
;
when
the
street
of
Manchester
be
comparatively
quiet
,
for
a
few
shopping
lady
and
lounge
gentleman
count
for
nothing
in
that
busy
,
bustling
,
live
place
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
have
be
on
an
errand
for
his
master
,
instead
of
return
to
his
dinner
;
and
in
pass
along
a
lane
,
a
road
(
call
,
in
compliment
to
the
intention
of
some
future
builder
,
a
street
)
,
he
encounter
Harry
Carson
,
the
only
person
,
as
far
as
he
see
,
beside
himself
,
tread
the
unfrequented
path
.
<EOS>
along
one
side
run
a
high
broad
fence
,
blacken
over
by
coal
-
tar
,
and
spike
and
stick
with
pointed
nail
at
the
top
,
to
prevent
any
one
from
climb
over
into
the
garden
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
fence
be
the
footpath
.
 
<EOS>
the
carriage
-
road
be
such
as
no
carriage
,
no
,
not
even
a
cart
,
could
possibly
have
pass
along
without
hercule
to
assist
in
lift
it
out
of
the
deep
clay
rut
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
be
a
dead
brick
wall
;
and
a
field
after
that
,
where
there
be
a
saw
-
pit
and
joiner
's
shed
.
  
<EOS>
Jem
's
heart
beat
violently
when
he
see
the
gay
,
handsome
young
man
approach
,
with
a
light
buoyant
step
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
then
,
be
he
whom
Mary
love
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
,
perhaps
,
no
wonder
;
for
he
seem
to
the
poor
smith
so
elegant
,
so
well
appoint
,
that
he
feel
the
superiority
in
external
,
strangely
and
painfully
,
for
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
then
something
uprose
within
him
,
and
tell
him
,
that
"
a
man
be
a
man
for
a
'
that
,
for
a
'
that
,
and
twice
as
much
as
a
'
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
he
no
longer
feel
troubled
by
the
outward
appearance
of
his
rival
.
  
<EOS>
Harry
Carson
come
on
,
lightly
bound
over
the
dirty
place
with
almost
a
lad
's
buoyancy
.
 
<EOS>
to
his
surprise
the
dark
,
sturdy
-
look
artisan
stop
him
by
say
respectfully
   
"
May
I
speak
a
word
wi
'
you
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
certainly
,
my
good
man
,
"
look
his
astonishment
;
then
find
that
the
promise
speech
do
not
come
very
quickly
,
he
add
,
"
<EOS>
but
make
haste
,
for
I
be
in
a
hurry
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
have
cast
about
for
some
less
abrupt
way
of
broach
the
subject
uppermost
in
his
mind
than
he
now
find
himself
oblige
to
use
.
<EOS>
with
a
husky
voice
that
tremble
as
he
speak
,
he
say
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
sir
,
yo're
keep
company
wi
'
a
young
woman
call
Mary
Barton
?
"
  
<EOS>
a
light
break
in
upon
Henry
Carson
's
mind
,
and
he
pause
before
he
give
the
answer
for
which
the
other
wait
.
  
<EOS>
Could
this
man
be
a
lover
of
Mary
's
?
 
<EOS>
and
(
strange
stinging
think
)
<EOS>
could
he
be
beloved
by
her
,
and
so
have
cause
her
obstinate
rejection
of
himself
?
 
<EOS>
He
look
at
Jem
from
head
to
foot
,
a
black
,
grimy
mechanic
,
in
dirty
fustian
clothe
,
strongly
build
,
and
awkward
(
accord
to
the
dancing
-
master
)
;
then
he
glance
at
himself
,
and
recall
the
reflection
he
have
so
lately
quit
in
his
bedroom
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
no
woman
with
eye
could
choose
the
one
when
the
other
woo
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Hyperion
to
a
Satyr
.
 
<EOS>
that
quotation
come
aptly
;
he
forget
"
that
a
man
be
a
man
for
a
'
that
.
"
<EOS>
and
yet
here
be
a
clue
,
which
he
have
often
want
,
to
her
changed
conduct
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
love
this
man
 
if
 
he
hate
the
fellow
,
and
long
to
strike
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
know
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
Barton
!
<EOS>
let
me
see
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
that
be
the
name
of
the
girl
.
 
<EOS>
an
arrant
flirt
the
little
hussy
be
;
but
very
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
ay
,
Mary
Barton
be
her
name
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
bite
his
lip
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
then
so
;
that
Mary
be
a
flirt
;
the
giddy
creature
of
whom
he
speak
?
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
believe
it
,
and
yet
how
he
wish
the
suggestive
word
unspoken
.
 
<EOS>
that
thought
must
keep
now
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
even
if
she
be
,
the
more
reason
for
there
be
some
one
to
protect
her
;
poor
faulty
darling
,
  
<EOS>
"
She
be
a
good
girl
,
sir
,
though
maybe
a
bit
set
up
with
her
beauty
;
but
she
be
her
father
's
only
child
,
sir
,
and
"
 
h
e
stop
;
he
do
not
like
to
express
suspicion
,
and
yet
he
be
determine
he
would
be
certain
there
be
ground
for
none
.
 
<EOS>
what
should
he
say
?
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
my
fine
fellow
,
and
what
have
I
to
do
with
that
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
but
loss
of
my
time
,
and
yours
,
too
,
if
you
have
only
stop
me
to
tell
me
Mary
Barton
be
very
pretty
<EOS>
;
I
know
that
well
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
seem
as
though
he
would
have
go
on
,
but
Jem
put
his
black
,
work
,
right
hand
upon
his
arm
to
detain
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
haughty
young
man
shake
it
off
,
and
with
his
glove
pretend
to
brush
away
the
sooty
contamination
that
may
be
leave
upon
his
light
greatcoat
sleeve
.
 
<EOS>
the
little
action
arouse
Jem
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
in
plain
word
,
what
I
have
get
to
say
to
you
,
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
be
tell
me
by
one
as
know
,
and
have
see
,
that
you
walk
with
this
same
Mary
Barton
,
and
be
know
to
be
court
her
;
and
her
as
speak
to
me
about
it
,
think
as
how
Mary
love
you
.
<EOS>
that
may
be
or
may
not
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
an
old
friend
of
hers
and
her
father
's
;
and
I
just
wish
to
know
if
you
mean
to
marry
the
girl
.
<EOS>
spite
of
what
you
say
of
her
lightness
,
I
ha
'
know
her
long
enough
to
be
sure
she
will
make
a
noble
wife
for
any
one
,
let
him
be
what
he
may
;
and
I
mean
to
stand
by
her
like
a
brother
;
and
if
you
mean
rightly
,
you
will
not
think
the
bad
on
me
for
what
I
have
now
say
;
and
if
 
but
no
,
I
will
not
say
what
I
will
do
to
the
man
who
wrong
a
hair
of
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
He
shall
rue
it
to
the
long
day
he
live
,
that
be
all
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
sir
,
what
I
ask
of
you
be
this
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
mean
fair
and
honourable
by
her
,
well
and
good
:
<EOS>
but
if
not
,
for
your
own
sake
as
well
as
her
,
leave
her
alone
,
and
never
speak
to
her
more
.
<EOS>
"
Jem
's
voice
quiver
with
the
earnestness
with
which
he
speak
,
and
he
eagerly
wait
for
some
answer
.
  
<EOS>
Harry
Carson
,
meanwhile
,
instead
of
attend
very
particularly
to
the
purpose
the
man
have
in
address
him
,
be
try
to
gather
from
his
speech
what
be
the
real
state
of
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
He
succeed
so
far
as
to
comprehend
that
Jem
incline
to
believe
that
Mary
love
his
rival
;
and
consequently
,
that
if
the
speaker
be
attach
to
her
himself
,
he
be
not
a
favoured
admirer
.
 
<EOS>
the
idea
come
into
Mr.
Carson
's
mind
,
that
perhaps
,
after
all
,
Mary
love
him
in
spite
of
her
frequent
and
obstinate
rejection
;
and
that
she
have
employ
this
person
(
whoever
he
be
)
to
bully
him
into
marry
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
resolve
to
try
and
ascertain
more
correctly
the
man
's
relation
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
either
he
be
a
lover
,
and
if
so
,
not
a
favour
one
(
in
which
case
Mr.
Carson
could
not
at
all
understand
the
man
's
motive
for
interesting
himself
in
secure
her
marriage
)
;
or
<EOS>
he
be
a
friend
,
an
accomplice
,
whom
she
have
employ
to
bully
him
.
 
<EOS>
so
little
faith
in
goodness
have
the
mean
and
selfish
!
  
<EOS>
"
before
I
make
you
into
my
confidant
,
my
good
man
,
"
say
Mr.
Carson
,
in
a
contemptuous
tone
,
"
I
think
it
may

the

there
may

about
twenty
gentleman

include
some
by
courtesy
,
who
be
not
immediately
concerned

the
settlement

question

who

nevertheless

be
sufficiently
interested
to
attend

<EOS>
these
be
divide
into
little
group
,
who
do
not
seem
by
any
mean
unanimous

<EOS>
some
be
for
a
slight
concession
,
just
a
sugar

plum
to
quieten
the
naughty
child

a
sacrifice
to
peace

some

steadily

vehemently
oppose

precedent

tittle

the
outward
force

turn

out

It
be
teach
the
workpeople
how
to
become
master

say
they

<EOS>
do
they
want
the
wild
thing
here

after
,
they
would
know
that
the
way
to
obtain
their
wish
would
be
to
strike
work

<EOS>
besides
,
one
or
two
of
those
present
have
only
just
return
from
the
New
Bailey
,
where
one
of
the
turn

out
have
be
try
for
a
cruel
assault
on
a
poor
north

country
weaver
,
who
have
attempt
to
work
at
the
low
price

<EOS>
They
be
indignant
,

justly
so
,
at
the
merciless
manner
in
which
the
poor
fellow
have
be
treat
;
and
their
indignation
at
wrong
,
take
(
as
it

do

the
extreme
form

revenge

They
feel
as

rather

body

the
consequence

believe

for

however
insane

without

such
be
their

truth

you
can

violence
by
violence

You
may
put
it
down

a
time

while
you
be
crow
over
your
imaginary
success

see
if
it
do
not
return
with
seven
devil
bad

its
former
self

<EOS>
no
one
thought
of
treat
the
workman
as
brother

friend
,
and
openly
,
clearly
,
as
appeal

state
exactly

fully
the
circumstance

lead
the

policy

themselves

enter

on
to

in

more
livid

eye
more
fierce

<EOS>
one

in
obedience
to

They
receive
it
with
deep
brooding
silence
,
but

never

and
leave
the

Starved

a

<EOS>
the
idle

the
industrious
class

<EOS>
the
room
be
not
large
,
but
its
bareness
of
furniture
make
it
appear
so
.
 
<EOS>
unshaded

flare
down
upon
the
lean
and
unwashed
artisan
as
they
enter
,
their
eye
blink
at
the
excess
of
light
.
  
<EOS>
They
take
their
seat
on
bench
,
and
await
the
deputation
.
 
<EOS>
the
latter
,
gloomily
and
ferociously
,
deliver
the

ultimatum
,
add
thereto
not

word
of

and
it
sink
all
the

the
sore
heart
of
the
listener
for
their
forbearance
.
  
<EOS>
then

(
who
have

<EOS>
You
would

<EOS>
He

among

<EOS>
He
may
have
be
a
disgraced
medical
student
of
the
Bob
Sawyer
class

an
unsuccessful

or
a
flashy
shopman

<EOS>
the
impression
he
would
have
give
you
would
have
be
unfavourable
,
and
yet
there
be
much
about
him
that
could
only
be
characterise
as
doubtful

<EOS>
He
smirk
in
acknowledgment
of
their
uncouth
greeting
,
and
sit
down
;
then
glance
round
,
he
inquire
whether
it
would
not
be
agreeable
to
the

present
to
have
pipe
and
liquor
hand
round

add
,
that
he
would

into
a
liking
for
tobacco
,
beer
,
and
similar
gratification
,
gleam
up
at
the
proposal
of
the
London
delegate
.
 
<EOS>
tobacco
and
drink
deaden
the
pang
of
hunger
,
and
make
one
forget
the
miserable
home
,
the
desolate
future

<EOS>
They

He

"
You
will
wonder
,
chap
,
<EOS>
how
I
come
to
miss
the
time
this
morning
;
I
will
just
tell
you
what
I
be
a
-
doing
.
 
<EOS>
Th
'
chaplain
at
the
New
Bailey
send
and
give
me
an
order
to
see
Jonas
Higginbotham
;
him
as
be
take
up
last
week
for
throw
vitriol
in
a
knob
-
stick
's
face
.
<EOS>
well
,
I
could
not
help
but
go
;
and
I
do
not
reckon
it
would
ha
'
keep
me
so
late
.
 
<EOS>
Jonas
be
like
one
crazy
when
I
get
to
him
;
he
say
he
could
na
get
rest
night
or
day
for
th
'
face
of
the
poor
fellow
he
have
damage
;
then
he
think
on
his
weak
,
clemmed
look
,
as
he
tramp
,
footsore
,
into
town
;
and
Jonas
think
,
maybe
,
he
have
leave
them
at
home
as
would
look
for
news
,
and
hope
and
get
none
,
but
,
haply
,
tiding
of
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
well
,
Jonas
have
think
on
these
thing
till
he
could
not
rest
,
but
walk
up
and
down
continually
like
a
wild
beast
in
his
cage
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
he
bethink
him
on
a
way
to
help
a
bit
,
and
he
get
the
chaplain
to
send
for
me
;
and
he
tell
me
this
;
and
that
th
'
man
be
lie
in
the
Infirmary
,
and
he
bid
me
go
<EOS>
(
to
-
day
's
the
day
as
folk
may
be
admit
into
th
'
infirmary
)
and
get
his
silver
watch
,
as
be
his
mother
's
,
and
sell
it
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
take
the
money
,
and
bid
the
poor
knob
-
stick
send
it
to
his
friend
beyond
Burnley
;
and
I
be
to
take
him
Jonas
's
kind
regard
,
and
he
humbly
axe
him
to
forgive
him
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
do
what
Jonas
wish
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
bless
your
life
,
none
on
us
would
ever
throw
vitriol
again
(
at
least
at
a
knob
-
stick
)
if
they
could
see
the
sight
I
see
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
lie
,
his
face
all
wrap
in
cloth
,
so
I
do
not
see
that
:
but
not
a
limb
,
nor
a
bit
of
a
limb
,
could
keep
from
quiver
with
pain
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
ha
'
bitten
his
hand
to
keep
down
his
moan
,
but
could
not
,
his
face
hurt
him
so
if
he
move
it
<EOS>
e'er
<EOS>
so
little
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
scarce
mind
me
when
I
tell
him
about
Jonas
;
he
do
squeeze
my
hand
when
I
jingle
the
money
,
but
when
I
axe
his
wife
's
name
,
he
shriek
out
,
"
Mary
,
Mary
,
shall
I
never
see
you
again
?
 
<EOS>
Mary
,
my
darling
,
they
have
make
me
blind
because
I
want
to
work
for
you
and
our
own
baby
;
o
Mary
,
Mary
!
"
 
<EOS>
then
the
nurse
come
,
and
say
he
be
rave
,
and
that
I
have
make
him
bad
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
afeard
<EOS>
it
be
true
;
yet
I
be
loth
to
go
without
know
where
to
send
the
money
.
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
.
.
 
<EOS>
so
that
keep
me
beyond
my
time
,
chap
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
hear
where
the
wife
live
at
last
?
"
ask
many
anxious
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
he
go
on
talk
to
her
,
till
his
word
cut
my
heart
like
a
knife
.
 
<EOS>
I
axe
th
'
nurse
to
find
out
who
she
be
,
and
where
she
live
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
I
be
more
especial
name
it
now
for
be
this
,
 
for
one
thing
I
want
you
all
to
know
why
I
be
not
at
my
post
this
morning
;
for
another
,
I
wish
to
say
,
that
I
,
for
one
,
ha
'
see
enough
of
what
come
of
attack
knob
-
stick
,
and
I
will
ha
'
nought
to
do
with
it
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
some
expression
of
disapprobation
,
but
John
do
not
mind
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
!
<EOS>
I
be
no
coward
,
"
he
reply
,
"
and
I
be
true
to
th
'
backbone
.
<EOS>
what
I
would
like
,
and
what
I
would
do
,
would
be
to
fight
the
master
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
among
yo
call
me
a
coward
.
 
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
every
man
have
a
right
to
his
opinion
;
but
since
I
have
think
on
th
'
matter
to
-
day
<EOS>
I
have
think
we
han
all
on
us
<EOS>
be
more
like
coward
in
attack
the
poor
like
ourselves
;
them
as
have
none
to
help
,
but
mun
choose
between
vitriol
and
starvation
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
we
be
more
cowardly
in
do
that
than
in
leave
them
alone
.
 
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
what
I
would
do
be
this
.
<EOS>
have
at
the
master
!
"
 
<EOS>
again
he
shout
,
"
have
at
the
master
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
speak
lower
;
all
listen
with
hushed
breath
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
master
as
have
work
this
woe
;
it
be
the
master
as
should
pay
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Him
as
call
me
coward
just
now
,
may
try
if
I
be
one
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
set
me
to
serve
out
the
master
,
and
see
if
there
be
aught
I
will
stick
at
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
give
the
master
a
bit
on
a
fright
if
one
of
them
be
beat
within
an
inch
of
his
life
,
"
say
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
ay
!
or
beat
till
no
life
be
leave
in
him
,
"
growl
another
.
  
<EOS>
and
so
with
word
,
or
look
that
tell
more
than
word
,
they
build
up
a
deadly
plan
.
 
<EOS>
Deeper
and
darker
grow
the
import
of
their
speech
,
as
they
stand
hoarsely
mutter
their
meaning
out
,
and
glare
with
eye
that
tell
the
terror
their
own
thought
be
to
them
,
upon
their
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
Their
clenched
fist
,
their
set
tooth
,
their
livid
look
,
all
tell
the
suffering
which
their
mind
be
voluntarily
undergo
in
the
contemplation
of
crime
,
and
in
familiarise
themselves
with
its
detail
.
  
<EOS>
then
come
one
of
those
fierce
terrible
oath
which
bind
member
of
Trades
'
union
to
any
give
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
then
under
the
flare
gaslight
,
they
meet
together
to
consult
further
.
 
<EOS>
with
the
distrust
of
guilt
,
each
be
suspicious
of
his
neighbour
;
each
dread
the
treachery
of
another
.
 
<EOS>
a
number
of
piece
of
paper
(
the
identical
letter
on
which
the
caricature
have
be
draw
that
very
morning
)
be
tear
up
,
and
one
be

.
 
<EOS>
then
all
be
fold
up
again
,
look
exactly
alike
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
shuffle
together
in
a
hat
.
 
<EOS>
the
gas
be
extinguish
;
each
draw
out
a
paper
.
 
<EOS>
the
gas
be
re

light

<EOS>
then
each
go
as
far
as
he
could
from
his
fellow
,
and
examine
the
paper
he
have
draw
without
say
a
word
,
and
with
a
countenance
as
stony
and
immovable
as
he
could
make
it
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
still
rigidly
silent
,
they
each
take
up
their
hat
and
go
every
one
his
own
way
.
  
<EOS>
He
who
have
draw
the
mark
paper
have
draw
the
lot
of
the
assassin
!
<EOS>
and
he
have
swear
to
act

to
his

<EOS>
but

He

He

She

of
sisterly
love
have
gush
up
in
her
heart

so
sorry
do

"
<EOS>
well

and
why
on

<EOS>
You

sixpence

I
have
not

three
shilling

no
,
nor
even
a

,
not
here

before
I
come
I
give
my
landlady
enough
to
carry
me
to
the
island
and
back
,
and
maybe
a
trifle
for
present
,
and
I
bring
the
rest
here

it
be
all
go

this
,
"
jingle
a
few
copper
in
his
hand

<EOS>
"
Nay
,
never
fret
over
my
walk
a
matter
of
thirty
mile

add
he
,
as
he
see
she
look
grave
and
sorry

<EOS>
"
It
be
a
fine
clear
night
,
and
I
shall
set
off
betime
,
and
get
in
afore
the
Manx
packet
sail
.
<EOS>
where
be
your
father
go
?
 
<EOS>
to
Glasgow
do
you
say
?
 
<EOS>
perhaps
he
and
I
may
have
a
bit
of
a
trip
together
then
,
for
,
if
the
Manx
boat
have
sail
when
I
get
into
Liverpool
,
I
shall
go
by
a
Scotch
packet
.
<EOS>
what
be
he
go
to
do
in
Glasgow
?
 
<EOS>
seek
for
work
?
 
<EOS>
Trade
be
as
bad
there
as
here
,
folk
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
he
know
that
,
"
answer
Mary
sadly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
sometimes
think
he
will
never
get
work
again
,
and
that
trade
will
never
mend
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
hard
to
keep
up
one
's
heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
be
a
boy
<EOS>
,
I
would
go
to
sea
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
get
away
from
bad
news
at
any
rate
;
and
now
,
there
be
hardly
a
creature
that
cross
the
door
-
step
,
but
have
something
sad
and
unhappy
to
tell
one
.
 
<EOS>
Father
be
go
as
a
delegate
from
his
Union
,
to
ask
help
from
the
Glasgow
folk
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
start
this
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
sigh
,
for
the
feeling
again
come
over
her
that
it
be
very
flat
to
be
leave
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
say
no
one
cross
the
threshold
but
have
something
sad
to
say
;
you
do
not
mean
that
Margaret
Jennings
have
any
trouble
?
<EOS>
"
ask
the
young
sailor
anxiously
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
!
"
reply
Mary
,
smile
a
little
;
"
she
be
the
only
one
I
know
,
I
believe
,
who
seem
free
from
care
.
 
<EOS>
Her
blindness
almost
appear
a
blessing
sometimes
;
she
be
so
down
-
hearted
when
she
dread
it
,
and
now
she
seem
so
calm
and
happy
<EOS>
when
it
be
downright
come
.
 
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
Margaret
's
happy
,
I
do
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
almost
wish
it
have
be
otherwise
,
"
say
Will
thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
have
be
so
glad
to
comfort
her
,
and
cherish
her
,
if
she
have
be
in
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
can
not
you
cherish
her
,
even
though
she
be
happy
?
"
ask
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
.
 
<EOS>
She
seem
so
much
well
than
I
be
!
 
<EOS>
and
her
voice
!
 
<EOS>
when
I
hear
it
,
and
think
of
the
wish
that
be
in
my
heart
,
it
seem
as
much
out
of
place
to
ask
her
to
be
my
wife
,
as
it
would
be
to
ask
an
angel
from
heaven
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
could
not
help
laugh
outright
,
in
spite
of
her
depression
,
at
the
idea
of
Margaret
as
an
angel
;
it
be
so
difficult
(
even
to
her
dressmaking
imagination
)
to
fancy
where
,
and
how
,
the
wing
would
be
fasten
to
the
brown
stuff
gown
,
or
the
blue
and
yellow
print
.
  
<EOS>
Will
laugh
,
too
,
a
little
,
out
of
sympathy
with
Mary
's
pretty
merry
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
say
   
<EOS>
"
ay
,
you
may
laugh
,
Mary
<EOS>
:
it
only
show
you
have
never
be
in
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
in
an
instant
Mary
be
carnation
colour
,
and
the
tear
spring
to
her
soft
grey
eye
.
 
<EOS>
She
that
be
suffer
so
much
from
the
doubt
arise
from
love
!
 
<EOS>
It
be
unkind
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
notice
her
change
of
look
and
of
complexion
.
 
<EOS>
He
only
notice
that
she
be
silent
,
so
he
continue
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
 
I
think
,
that
when
I
come
back
from
this
voyage
,
I
will
speak
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
my
fourth
voyage
in
the
same
ship
and
with
the
same
captain
,
and
he
be
promise
he
will
make
me
a
second
mate
after
this
trip
;
then
I
shall
have
something
to
offer
Margaret
;
and
her
grandfather
,
and
Aunt
Alice
,
shall
live
with
her
,
and
keep
her
from
be
lonesome
while
I
be
at
sea
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
speak
as
if
she
care
for
me
,
and
would
marry
me
;
d'ye
think
she
do
care
at
all
for
me
,
Mary
?
"
<EOS>
ask
he
anxiously
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
have
a
very
decide
opinion
of
her
own
on
the
subject
,
but
she
do
not
feel
as
if
she
have
any
right
to
give
it
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
say
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
ask
Margaret
,
not
me
,
<EOS>
Will
<EOS>
;
she
be
never
name
your
name
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
countenance
fall
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
I
should
say
that
be
a
good
sign
from
a
girl
like
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
to
say
what
I
think
;
but
,
if
I
be
you
,
I
would
not
leave
her
now
without
speak
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
speak
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
try
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
in
to
wish
them
good
-
bye
,
and
my
voice
stick
in
my
throat
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
say
nought
of
what
I
would
plan
to
say
;
and
I
never
think
of
be
so
bold
as
to
offer
her
marriage
till
I
would
be
my
next
trip
,
and
be
make
mate
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
even
offer
her
this
box
,
"
say
he
,
undo
his
paper
parcel
and
display
a
gaudily
ornament
accordion
;
"
I
long
to
buy
her
something
,
and
I
think
,
if
it
be
something
in
the
music
line
,
she
would
maybe
fancy
it
more
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
will
you
give
it
to
her
,
Mary
,
when
I
be
go
?
<EOS>
and
,
if
you
can
slip
in
something
tender
,
  
something
,
you
know
,
of
what
I
feel
 
<EOS>
maybe
she
would
listen
to
you
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
promise
that
she
would
do
all
that
he
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
think
on
her
many
and
many
a
night
,
when
I
be
keep
my
watch
in
mid
-
sea
;
I
wonder
if
she
will
ever
think
on
me
when
the
wind
be
whistle
,
and
the
gale
rise
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
often
speak
of
me
to
her
,
Mary
?
 
<EOS>
and
if
I
should
meet
with
any
mischance
,
tell
her
how
dear
,
how
very
dear
,
she
be
to
me
,
and
bid
her
,
for
the
sake
of
one
who
love
her
well
,
try
and
comfort
my
poor
aunt
Alice
.
 
<EOS>
dear
old
aunt
!
<EOS>
you
and
Margaret
will
often
go
and
see
her
,
will
not
you
?
 
<EOS>
She
be
sadly
fail
since
I
be
last
ashore
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
good
as
she
have
be
!
<EOS>
when
I
live
with
her
,
a
little
wee
chap
,
I
use
to
be
waken
by
the
neighbour
knock
her
up
;
this
one
be
ill
,
and
that
body
's
child
be
restless
;
and
for
as
tired
as
ever
she
may
be
,
she
would
be
up
and
dress
in
a
twinkling
,
never
think
of
the
hard
day
's
wash
afore
her
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Them
be
happy
time
!
 
<EOS>
how
pleased
I
use
to
be
when
she
would
take
me
into
the
field
with
her
to
gather
herb
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
taste
tea
in
China
since
then
,
but
it
be
not
half
so
good
as
the
herb
tea
she
use
to
make
for
me
o
'
Sunday
night
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
know
such
a
deal
about
plant
and
bird
,
and
their
way
.
 
<EOS>
She
use
to
tell
me
long
story
about
her
childhood
,
and
we
use
to
plan
how
we
would
go
some
time
,
please
God
(
that
be
always
her
word
)
,
and
live
near
her
old
home
beyond
Lancaster
;
in
the
very
cottage
where
she
be
bear
,
if
we
could
get
it
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
!
<EOS>
and
how
different
it
be
!
 
<EOS>
here
be
she
still
in
a
back
street
o
'
Manchester
,
never
likely
to
see
her
own
home
again
;
and
I
,
a
sailor
,
off
for
America
next
week
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
she
have
be
able
to
go
to
Burton
<EOS>
once
afore
she
die
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
maybe
have
find
all
sadly
change
,
"
say
Mary
,
though
her
heart
echo
Will
's
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
"
ay
!
<EOS>
ay
!
<EOS>
I
dare
say
it
be
good
.
 
<EOS>
one
thing
I
do
wish
though
,
<EOS>
and
I
have
often
wish
it
when
out
alone
on
the
deep
sea
,
when
even
the
most
thoughtless
can
not
choose
but
think
on
th
'
past
and
th
'
future
;
and
that
is
,
that
I
would
never
grieved
her
.
 
<EOS>
o
Mary
!
<EOS>
many
a
hasty
word
come
sorely
back
on
the
heart
when
one
think
one
shall
never
see
the
person
whom
one
have
grieve
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
both
stand
think
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
Mary
start
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
father
's
step
.
 
<EOS>
and
his
shirt
be
not
ready
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
hurry
to
her
iron
,
and
try
to
make
up
for
lose
time
.
  
<EOS>
John
Barton
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
haggard
and
wildly
anxious
-
looking
man
<EOS>
,
Will
think
he
have
never
see
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
at
Will
,
but
speak
no
word
of
greeting
or
welcome
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
come
to
bid
you
good
-
bye
,
"
say
the
sailor
,
and
would
in
his
sociable
friendly
humour
have
go
on
speak
.
 
<EOS>
but
John
answer
abruptly
   
"
<EOS>
good
-
bye
to
ye
,
then
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
that
in
his
manner
which
leave
no
doubt
of
his
desire
to
get
rid
of
the
visitor
,
and
Will
accordingly
shook
hand
with
Mary
,
and
look
at
John
,
as
if
doubt
how
far
to
offer
to
shake
hand
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
meet
with
no
answer
glance
or
gesture
,
so
he
go
his
way
,
stop
for
an
instant
at
the
door
to
say
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
think
on
me
on
Tuesday
,
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
day
we
shall
hoist
our
blue
Peter
,
Jack
Harris
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
Mary
be
heartily
sorry
when
the
door
close
;
it
seem
like
shut
out
a
friendly
sunbeam
.
 
<EOS>
and
her
father
!
<EOS>
what
could
be
the
matter
with
him
?
 
<EOS>
He
be
so
restless
;
not
speak
(
she
wish
he
would
)
,
but
start
up
and
then
sit
down
,
and
meddle
with
her
iron
;
he
seem
so
fierce
,
too
,
to
judge
from
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
She
wonder
if
he
dislike
Will
be
there
;
or
if
he
be
vex
to
find
that
she
have
not
get
further
on
with
her
work
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
she
could
bear
his
nervous
way
no
longer
,
it
make
her
equally
nervous
and
fidgety
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
when
be
you
go
,
father
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
the
time
<EOS>
o
'
the
train
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
why
shouldst
thou
know
?
<EOS>
"
reply
he
gruffly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Meddle
with
thy
ironing
,
but
donnot
be
ask
question
about
what
do
not
concern
thee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
get
you
something
to
eat
first
,
"
answer
she
gently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
dost
not
know
that
I
be
larn
to
do
without
food
,
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
look
at
him
to
see
if
he
speak
jestingly
.
 
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
he
look
savagely
grave
.
  
<EOS>
She
finish
her
bit
of
iron
,
and
begin
prepare
the
food
she
be
sure
her
father
need
;
for
by
this
time
her
experience
in
the
degree
of
hunger
have
teach
her
that
his
present
irritability
be
increase
,
if
not
cause
by
want
of
food
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
have
a
sovereign
give
him
to
pay
his
expense
as
delegate
to
Glasgow
,
and
out
of
this
he
have
give
Mary
a
few
shilling
in
the
morning
;
so
she
have
be
able
to
buy
a
sufficient
meal
,
and
now
her
care
be
to
cook
it
so
as
to
tempt
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
thou'rt
do
that
for
me
,
Mary
,
thou
mayst
spare
thy
labour
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
thee
<EOS>
I
be
not
for
eat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
just
a
little
bit
,
father
,
before
start
,
"
coax
Mary
perseveringly
.
  
<EOS>
at
that
instant
who
should
come
in
<EOS>
but
Job
Legh
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
often
he
come
,
but
when
he
do
pay
visit
,
Mary
know
from
past
experience
they
be
anything
but
short
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
's
countenance
fall
back
into
the
deep
gloom
from
which
it
be
but
just
emerge
at
the
sound
of
Mary
's
sweet
voice
,
and
pretty
pleading
.
 
<EOS>
He
become
again
restless
and
fidgety
,
scarcely
give
Job
Legh
<EOS>
the
greeting
necessary
for
a
host
in
his
own
house
.
 
<EOS>
Job
,
however
,
do
not
stand
upon
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
come
to
pay
a
visit
,
and
be
not
to
be
daunt
from
his
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
interested
in
John
Barton
's
mission
to
Glasgow
,
and
want
to
hear
all
about
it
;
so
he
sit
down
,
and
make
himself
comfortable
,
in
a
manner
that
Mary
see
be
mean
to
be
stationary
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
thou'rt
off
to
Glasgow
,
art
thou
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he

his
catechism

"
  
<EOS>
that
be
just
what
Mary
want
to
know
;
but
what
apparently
her
father
be
in
no
mood
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
He
get
up
without
speak
,
and
go
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
know
from
his
step
,
and
his
way
,
how
much
he
be
put
out

and
fear
Job
would
see
it
too
!
 
<EOS>
but
no
!
<EOS>
Job
seem
imperturbable
.
 
<EOS>
so
much
the
well
,
and
perhaps
she
could
cover
her
father
's
rudeness
by
her
own
civility
to
so
kind
a
friend
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
half
-
listening
to
her
father
's
movement
upstairs
(
passionate
,
violent
,
restless
motion
they
be
)
,
and
half
-
attend
to
Job
Legh
<EOS>
,
she
try
to
pay
him
all
due
regard
.
  
<EOS>
"
when

that
plaguing
question
again

<EOS>
"
oh

She
be
meaning
to
go
and
keep
Alice

company
for
an
hour
or
so
this
evening
:
as
soon
as
she

her
nephew
will
have
start
for
Liverpool
;
for
she
fancy
the
old
woman
will
feel
a

lonesome

Th

for
your

"
  
<EOS>
"
yes

You

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay

<EOS>
I
be
one
,
sure
enough

I
be
but
a
sleep
partner
in
the
concern

<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
become
a
member
for
peace

else
I
do

Yo

for
differ
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
there
be
no
harm
in
that

<EOS>
but
then
they
will
not
let
me
be
silly
in
peace
and
quietness
,
but
will
force
me
to
be
as
wise
as
they
be
;
now
that
be
not
british
liberty
,
I
say
.

what
could
her

<EOS>
Tramping
and
bang
about

<EOS>
why
do
he

<EOS>
or
why

not
Job

the

no

<EOS>
"
You
see
my
folly
be
this
,
Mary

<EOS>
I
would
take
what
I
could
get
;
I
think
half
a
loaf
be
well
than
no
bread
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
work
for
low
wage
rather
than
sit
idle

starve

come
the
Trades

Union

"
well

if

worry
you
out
of

Will
you

will
you
be
worried

<EOS>
"
now
clem
be
a
quiet
death
,
and
worrying
be
not

so
I
choose
clem
,
and
come
into
th

I
would
wish

leave
me
free

<EOS>
Creak

<EOS>
Her
father
be
come
down
at
last

<EOS>
yes
,
he
come
down
,
but
more
doggedly
fierce
than
before
,
and
make
up
for
his
journey
,
too
;
with
his
little
bundle
on
his
arm

<EOS>
He
go
up
to
Job

and
,
more
civilly
than
Mary
expect
,
wish
him
good

<EOS>
He
then
turn
to
her
,
and
in
a
short
cold
manner
,
bade
her
farewell
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh

She
follow
him
to
the
door

blind
by
sudden
tear

she
stand
there

after
him

<EOS>
He
be
so
strange
,
so
cold
,
so
hard
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
,
at
the
end
of
the
court

he
turn
,
and
see
her
stand
there
;
he
come
back
quickly

take
her
in

faintly

mournfully

<EOS>
"
It

I
could

<EOS>
so
say
,
he
unlace
her
soft
twine
arm

and
kiss
her
once
more
,
set
off
on
his
fierce
errand

<EOS>
and
he
be
out

<EOS>
She
do
not
know
why

she
have
never

feel
so
depressed

so
desolate

<EOS>
She
turn
in

<EOS>
Her

,
as
soon
as
he
be
out

slacken
his
pace

and
fall
into
that
heavy
listless
step
which
tell

as
well

of
hopelessness

weakness

It

His

be
run
on

Tom

on

of
happy
year

<EOS>
He
follow
the
sound

and
find
a
poor
little
mortal

who

John
Barton

the
little
laddie

with
beautiful
patience
he
gather
fragment
of
mean
from
the
half
-
spoken
word
which
come
mingle
with
sobs
from
the
terrified
little
heart

<EOS>
so

aid
by
inquiry
here

there
from

be
too
busy
to
miss
him

but
now
receive
him
with
thankfulness

and
with
an
eloquent
irish
blessing

<EOS>
when
John
hear
the
word
of

he
shake
his

mournfully

turn
away

She

impatience
towards
him
so
far
as
to
be
able

<EOS>
a
leaden
weight
seem
to
hang
over
her
;
a
sort
of
presentiment
of
evil
,
or
perhaps
only
an
excess
of
low

spirited
feeling
in
consequence
of
the
two
departure
which
have
take
place
that
afternoon

<EOS>
She
wonder
how
long
Job
Legh

<EOS>
She
do
not

she

so
much
to

how

otherwise

so
many
do

She
have
live
longer
with

to
her
their
manner
be
far
less
haughty
than
to
the
other
domestic

<EOS>
She
occasionally
come
into
the
drawing

room
to
look
for
thing
belong

it
do

when

He

dead

crimson
with
life

<EOS>
the
policeman
have
advance
,
and
stand
ready

<EOS>
but
at
first
the
old
man

mind
could
only
take
in
the
idea
of
death
;
slowly
,
slowly
come
the
conception
of
violence
,
of
murder

"
how
do
he
die
?
<EOS>
"
he
groan
forth

unfrequented
way
Mr.

know
,
but
a
short
cut
to
his
garden
door

of
which
Harry
have

;
that
as
he
(
the
policeman

come
nearer
,
he
have
hear
footstep
as
of
a
man
run
away
;
but
the
evening
be
so
dark
(
the
moon
not
have

that
he
could
see

light
of
the
lantern
they
have
discover
who
it
be
that
have
be
kill

<EOS>
that
they
believe
him
to
be
dead
when
they
first
take
him
up
,
as
he
have
never
move
,
speak
,
or
breathe

<EOS>
that
intelligence
of
the
murder
have
be
send
to
the

who
would

that

<EOS>
"
where

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
lift
up
some
of
the
thick
chestnut
curl
,
and
show
a
blue
spot
(
you
could
hardly
call
it
a
hole
,
the
flesh
have
close
so
much
over
it
)
in
the
left
temple

<EOS>
a
deadly
aim

<EOS>
and
yet
it
be
so
dark
a
night

<EOS>
"
He
must
have
be
close
upon
him
,
"
say
one
policeman

<EOS>
"
and
have
have
him
between
him

add
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
commotion
at
the
door
of
the
room
,
and
there
stand
poor
Mrs.
Carson
,
the
mother
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
hear
unusual
noise
in
the
house
,
and
have
send
down
her
maid
(
much
more
a
companion
to
her
than
her
highly
-
educate
daughter
)
to
discover
what
be
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
maid
either
forget
,
or
dread
,
to
return
;
and
with
nervous
impatience
Mrs.
Carson
come
down
herself
,
and
have
trace
the
hum
and
buzz
of
voice
to
the
servant
'
hall
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
turn
round
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
could
not
leave
the
dead
for
any
one
live
.
  
<EOS>
"
take
her
away
,
nurse
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
no
sight
for
her

<EOS>
Tell
Miss
Sophy
to
go
to
her
mother

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
His
eye
be
again
fix
on
the
dead
face
of
his
son
.
  
<EOS>
presently
Mrs.
Carson
's
hysterical
cry
be
hear
all
over
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Her
husband
shudder
at
the
outward
expression
of
the
agony
which
be
rend
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
then
the
police
superintendent
come
,
and
after
him
the
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
the
latter
go
through
all
the
form
of
ascertain
death
,
without
utter
a
word
,
and
when
at
the
conclusion
of
the
operation
of
open
a
vein
,
from
which
no
blood
flow
,
he
shake
his
head
,
all
present
understand
the
confirmation
of
their
previous
belief
.
 
<EOS>
the
superintendent
ask
to
speak
to
Mr.
Carson
in
private
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
just
what
I
be
go
to
request
of
you
,
"
answer
he
;
so
he
lead
the
way
into
the
dining
-
room
,
with
the
wine
-
glass
still
on
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
the
door
be
carefully
shut
,
and
both
sit
down
,
each
apparently
wait
for
the
other
to
begin
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
Mr.
Carson
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
probably
have
hear
that
I
be
a
rich
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
superintendent
bow
in
assent
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
half
 
nay
,
if
necessary
,
the
whole
of
my
fortune
I
will
give
to
have
the
murderer
bring
to
the
gallow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
every
exertion
,
you
may
be
sure
,
sir
,
shall
be
use
on
our
part
;
but
probably
offer
a
handsome
reward
may
accelerate
the
discovery
of
the
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
I
want
particularly
to
tell
you
,
sir
,
be
that
one
of
my
man
have
already
get
some
clue
,
and
that
another
(
who
accompany
me
here
)
have
within
this
quarter
of
an
hour
find
a
gun
in
the
field
which
the
murderer
cross
,
and
which
he
probably
throw
away
when
pursue
,
as
encumber
his
flight
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
small
doubt
of
discover
the
murderer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
you
call
a
handsome
reward
?
"
say
Mr.
Carson
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
three
,
or
five
hundred
pound
be
a
munificent
reward
:
more
than
will
probably
be
require
as
a
temptation
to
any
accomplice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
make
it
a
thousand
,
"
say
Mr.
Carson
decisively
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
doing
of
those
damned
turn
-
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
imagine
not
,
"
say
the
superintendent
.
 
<EOS>
"
some
day
ago
the
man
I
be
name
to
you
before
,
report
to
the
inspector
when
he
come
on
his
beat
,
that
he
have
to
separate
your
son
from
a
young
man
,
who
by
his
dress
he
believe
to
be
employ
in
a
foundry
;
that
the
man
have
throw
Mr.
Carson
down
,
and
seem
inclined
to
proceed
to
more
violence
,
when
the
policeman
come
up
and
interfere
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
my
man
wish
to
give
him
in
charge
for
an
assault
,
but
Mr.
Carson
would
not
allow
that
to
be
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
just
like
him
!
 
<EOS>
noble
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
murmur
the
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
after
your
son
have
leave
,
the
man
make
use
of
some
pretty
strong
threat
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
be
rather
a
curious
coincidence
that
this
scuffle
take
place
in
the
very
same
spot
where
the
murder
be
commit
;
in
Turner
Street
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
some
one
knock
at
the
door
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Sophy
,
who
beckon
her
father
out
,
and
then
ask
him
,
in
an
awestruck
whisper
,
to
come
upstairs
and
speak
to
her
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
not
leave
Harry
,
and
talk
so
strangely
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
 
indeed
 
papa
,
I
think
she
have
lose
her
sense
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
the
poor
girl
sob
bitterly
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
she
?
"
ask
Mr.
Carson
.
  
<EOS>
"
in
his
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
go
upstairs
rapidly
and
silently
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
large
comfortable
bedroom
;
too
large
to
be
well
light
by
the
flare
,
flicker
kitchen
-
candle
which
have
be
hastily
snatch
up
,
and
now
stand
on
the
dressing
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
bed
,
surround
by
its
heavy
,
pall
-
like
green
curtain
,
lie
the
dead
son
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
carry
him
up
,
and
lay
him
down
,
as
tenderly
as
though
they
fear
to
waken
him
;
and
,
indeed
,
it
look
more
like
sleep
than
death
,
so
very
calm
and
full
of
repose
be
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
,
too
,
the
chiselled
beauty
of
the
feature
much
more
perfectly
than
when
the
brilliant
colouring
of
life
have
distract
your
attention
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
peace
about
him
which
tell
that
death
have
come
too
instantaneously
to
give
any
previous
pain
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
chair
,
at
the
head
of
the
bed
,
sit
the
mother
 
smile
.
 
<EOS>
She
hold
one
of
the
hand
(
rapidly
stiffen
,
even
in
her
warm
grasp
)
,
and
gently
stroke
the
back
of
it
,
with
the
endearing
caress
she
have
use
to
all
her
child
when
young
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
glad
you
be
come
,
"
say
she
,
look
up
at
her
husband
,
and
still
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
Harry
be
so
full
of
fun
,
he
always
have
something
new
to
amuse
us
with
;
and
now
he
pretend
he
be
asleep
,
and
that
we
can
not
waken
him
.
 
<EOS>
look
!
<EOS>
he
be
smile
now
;
he
hear
I
have
find
him
out
.
 
<EOS>
look
!
"
  
<EOS>
and
,
in
truth
,
the
lip
,
in
the
rest
of
death
,
do
look
as
though
they
wear
a
smile
,
and
the
wave
light
of
the
unsnuffed
candle
almost
make
them
seem
to
move
.
  
<EOS>
"
look
,
Amy
,
"
say
she
to
her
young
child
,
who
knelt
at
her
foot
,
try
to
soothe
her
,
by
kiss
her
garment

oh

he
be
always
a
rogue

You
remember

do
not
you

love

<EOS>
how
full
of
play
he
be
as
a
baby
;
hide
his
face
under
my
arm
,
when
you
want
to
play
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
always
a
rogue

Harry

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
get
her
away
,
sir
,
"
say
nurse
;
<EOS>
"
you
know
there
be
much
to
be
do
before

"
I
understand

nurse

say
the
father
,
hastily
interrupt
her
in
dread
of
the
distinct
word
which
would
tell
of
the
change
of
mortality
.
  
<EOS>
"
come

he

They

into

yet
in

shivering
and
chattering

Sophy

catch
the
calm
beauty
of
the

so
calm
amidst
such
violence

examine
the

the

<EOS>
It
be
so
common
to
him
to
be
acquaint
with
crime

that
he
be
far
from

all
his
interest
absorb
in
the
present

of
violence

although
he
could
not

have
much
anxiety
to
detect
the
murderer

<EOS>
He
be
busy
look
at
the
only
oil

painting
in
the
room
(
a
youth
of
eighteen
or
so

in
a
fancy
dress

conjecture
its
identity
with

so
mysteriously
dead

<EOS>
nobody

<EOS>
It

strange
to
Sophy
to
hear
nurse
summon
from
her
mother
's
side
to
supper
,
in
the
middle
of
the
night

still
strange
that

the
necessity

out

but
just
as

It

Mary
could
do
nothing

feel
guilty
of
her
long
morning
nap
,
and
hasten
to
follow
Margaret
's
step
;
for
late
as
it
be
,
she
feel
she
could
not
settle
well
to

unless
she
learn
how
kind

so
,
eat
her
crust

of

bread
breakfast

she
pass
rapidly
along

<EOS>
She
remember
afterwards
the
little
group
of
people
she
have
see
,
eagerly
hear
,
and
imparting
news
;
but
at
the
time
her
only
care
be
to
hasten
on
her
way
,
in
dread
of
a
reprimand
from
Miss
Simmonds
.
  
<EOS>
She
go
into
the
house
at
Jane
Wilson

,
her
heart
at
the
instant
give
a
strange
knock
,

send
the
rosy
flush
into
her
face
,
at
the
thought
that
Jem

possibly
be
inside

I
do
assure

she

<EOS>
there
be
the
round
table

with
a
cup
and
saucer

which
have
evidently
be
use

and
there
be
Jane
Wilson
sit
on
the
other
side
,
cry
quietly
,
while
she
eat
her
breakfast
with
a
sort
of
unconscious
appetite

<EOS>
and
there
be
Mrs.

wash
away
at
a
night

cap

so

,
by

nothing
 
<EOS>

Alice
be
much
the

better

they
tell
her
:
at

she
could
speak
,
though
it
be

talk

Would
Mary
like

many

nought
of
her
present
state

<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
that
I
could
see
,
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
I
try
and
be
patient
with
her
afore

,
but
I
would
give
aught
I
have
to
see
her
,
and
see
what
she
want
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
useless
!
 
<EOS>
I
mean
to
stay
here
as
long
as
Jane
Wilson
be
alone
;
and
I
would
fain
be
here
all
to
-
night
,
but
"
    
"
I
will
come
,
"
say
Mary
decidedly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Davenport
say
she
would
come
again
,
but
she
be
hardworke
all
day
"
    
"
I
will
come
,
"
repeat
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
!
"
say
Margaret
,
"
and
I
will
be
here
till
you
come
.
 
<EOS>
maybe
,
Jem
and
you
could
take
th
'
night
between
you
,
and
Jane
Wilson
may
get
a
bit
of
sound
sleep
in
his
bed
;
for
she
be
up
and
down
the
well
part
of
last
night
,
and
just
when
she
be
in
a
sound
sleep
this
morning
,
between
two
and
three
,
Jem
come
home
,
and
th
'
sound
o
'
his
voice
rouse
her
in
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
have
he
be
till
that
time
<EOS>
o
'
night
?
"
ask
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
!
<EOS>
it
be
none
of
my
business
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
never
see
him
till
he
come
in
here
to
see
Alice
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
in
again
this
morning
,
and
seem
sadly
downcast
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
will
,
maybe
,
manage
to
comfort
him
to
-
night
,
Mary
,
"
say
Margaret
,
smile
,
while
a
ray
of
hope
glimmer
in
Mary
's
heart
,
and
she
almost
feel
glad
,
for
an
instant
,
of
the
occasion
which
would
at
last
bring
them
together
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
happy
night
!
<EOS>
when
would
it
come
?
 
<EOS>
many
hour
have
yet
to
pass
.
  
<EOS>
then
she
see
Alice
,
and
repent
,
with
a
bitter
self
-
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
could
not
help
have
gladness
in
the
depth
of
her
heart
,
blame
herself
as
she
would
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
try
not
to
think
,
as
she
hurry
along
to
Miss
Simmonds
'
,
with
a
dancing
step
of
lightness
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
late
 
that
she
know
she
should
be
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Simmonds
be
vexed
and
cross
.
 
<EOS>
that
also
she
have
anticipate
,
and
have
intend
to
smooth
her
raven
down
by
extraordinary
diligence
and
attention
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
something
about
the
girl
she
do
not
understand
 
have
not
anticipate
.
 
<EOS>
They
stop
talk
when
she
come
in
;
or
rather
,
I
should
say
,
stop
listen
,
for
Sally
Leadbitter
<EOS>
be
the
talker
to
whom
they
be
hearken
with
deep
attention
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
they
eye
Mary
,
as
if
she
have
acquire
some
new
interest
to
them
since
the
day
before
.
 
<EOS>
then
they
begin
to
whisper
;
and
,
absorb
as
Mary
have
be
in
her
own
thought
,
she
could
not
help
become
aware
that
it
be
of
her
they
speak
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
Sally
Leadbitter
ask
Mary
if
she
have
hear
the
news
?
  
<EOS>
"
no
!
 
<EOS>
what
news
?
<EOS>
"
answer
she
.
  
<EOS>
the
girl
look
at
each
other
with
gloomy
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
Sally
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
not
hear
that
young
Mr.
Carson
be
murder
last
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
's
lip
could
not
utter
a
negative
,
but
no
one
who
look
at
her
pale
and
terror
-
stricken
face
could
have
doubt
that
she
have
not
hear
before
of
the
fearful
occurrence
.
  
<EOS>
oh
,
it
be
terrible
,
that
sudden
information
,
that
one
you
have
know
have
meet
with
a
bloody
death
!
 
<EOS>
You
seem
to
shrink
from
the
world
where
such
deed
can
be
commit
,
and
to
grow
sick
with
the
idea
of
the
violent
and
wicked
man
of
earth
.
 
<EOS>
much
as
Mary
have
learn
to
dread
him
lately
,
now
he
be
dead
(
and
dead
in
such
a
manner
)
<EOS>
her
feeling
be
that
of
oppressive
sorrow
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
room
go
round
and
round
,
and
she
feel
as
though
she
should
faint
;
but
Miss
Simmonds
come
in
,
bring
a
waft
of
fresh
air
as
she
open
the
door
,
to
refresh
the
body
,
and
the
certainty
of
a
scolding
for
inattention
to
brace
the
sink
mind
.
 
<EOS>
She
,
too
,
be
full
of
the
morning
's
news
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
hear
any
more
of
this
horrid
affair
,
Miss
Barton
?
"
<EOS>
ask
she
,
as
she
settle
to
her
work
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
try
to
speak
;
at
first
she
could
not
,
and
when
she
succeed
in
utter
a
sentence
,
it
seem
as
though
it
be
not
her
own
voice
that
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
madam
,
I
never
hear
of
it
till
this
minute

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
that
be
strange

for
every
one

<EOS>
I
hope

<EOS>
I
hope

"
  
<EOS>
one
of
the
girl
remind
them
that
the
assize
come
on
next
week
.
  
<EOS>
"
ay

"
reply
Miss
Simmonds
,
"
and
the
milkman
tell
me
they
will
catch
the
wretch

and
have

<EOS>
such

"
  
<EOS>
then
each
begin
to
communicate
to
Miss
Simmonds
the
various
report
they
have
hear
.
  
<EOS>
suddenly
she
burst
out
   
"

cry
like

with
an
untimely
end

<EOS>
for
shame
of
yourself

<EOS>
mind
your
character

your
work

if
you

<EOS>
or
if
you
must
cry

(
see
her
scold
rather
increase
the
flow
of
Mary
's
tear
,
than
otherwise
)
<EOS>
,
"
take
this
print
to
cry
over

that

rub
it
,
as
if
she
love
it
,
with
a
clean
pocket

handkerchief
,
in
order
to
soften
the
edge
of
the
hard
round
drop

<EOS>
Mary
take
the
print
,
and
,
naturally
enough
,
have
have
leave
give
her
to
cry
over
it
,
rather
check
the
inclination
to
weep

<EOS>
everybody
be
full
of
the
one
subject

<EOS>
the
girl
send
out
to
match
silk
,
come
back
with
the
account
gather
at
the
shop
,
of
the
coroner
's
inquest
then
sit
;
the
lady
who
call
to
speak
about
gown
first
begin
about
the
murder
,
and
mingle
detail
of
that
,
with
direction
for
their
dress
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
feel
as
though
the
haunting
horror
be
a
nightmare
,
a
fearful
dream
,
from
which
awakening
would
relieve
her
.
 
<EOS>
the
picture
of
the
murder
body
,
far
more
ghastly
than
the
reality
,
seem
to
swim
in
the
air
before
her
eye
.
 
<EOS>
Sally
Leadbitter
look
and
speak
of
her
,
almost
accusingly
,
and
make
no
secret
now
of
Mary
's
conduct
,
more
blamable
to
her
fellow
-
workwoman
for
its
latter
changeableness
,
than
for
its
former
giddy
flirting
.
  
<EOS>
"
poor
young
gentleman
,
"
say
one
,
as
Sally
recount
Mary
's
last
interview
with
Mr.
Carson
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
shame
!
<EOS>
"
exclaim
another
,
look
indignantly
at
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
what
I
call
regular
jilting
,
"
say
a
third
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
he
lie
cold
and
bloody
in
his
coffin
now

<EOS>
Mary
be
more
thankful
than
she
could
express
,
when
Miss
Simmonds
return
,
to
put
a
stop
to
Sally
's
communication
,
and
to
check
the
remark
of
the
girl
.
  
<EOS>
She
long
for
the
peace
of
Alice
's
sick
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
no
more
thinking
with
infinite
delight
of
her
anticipate
meeting
with
Jem
<EOS>
;
she
feel
too
much
shocked
for
that
now
;
but
long
for
peace
and
kindness
,
for
the
image
of
rest
and
beauty
,
and
sinless
time
long
ago
,
which
the
poor
old
woman
's
rambling
present

she
wish
to
be
as
near
death
as
Alice

and
to
have
struggle
through
this
world
,
whose
suffering
she
have
early
learnt
,
and
whose
crime
now
seem
press
close
upon
her

<EOS>
old
text
from
the
Bible
,
that
her
mother
use
to
read
(
or
rather
spell
out
)
aloud
in
the
day
of
childhood
,
come
up
to
her
memory

<EOS>
"
where
the
wicked
cease

and
God

and
it
be
to
that
world
Alice

<EOS>
oh

that
she
be
Alice

<EOS>
I
must
return
to
the
Wilsons

house
,
which
be
far
from
be
the
abode
of
peace
that
Mary
be
picture
it
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
You
remember
the
reward
Mr.
Carson
offer
for
the
apprehension
of
the
murderer
of
his
son
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
in
itself
a
temptation
,
and
to
aid
its
efficacy
<EOS>
come
the
natural
sympathy
for
the
aged
parent
mourn
for
their
child
,
for
the
young
man
cut
off
in
the
flower
of
his
day
;
and
besides
this
,
there
be
always
a
pleasure
in
unravel
a
mystery
,
in
catch
at
the
gossamer
clue
which
will
guide
to
certainty
.
<EOS>
this
feeling
,
I
be
sure
,
give
much
impetus
to
the
police
.
 
<EOS>
Their
sense
be
ever
and
always
on
the
qui
-
vive
,
and
they
enjoy
the
collect
and
collate
evidence
,
and
the
life
of
adventure
they
experience
:
a
continual
unwinding
of
Jack
Sheppard
romance
,
always
interesting
to
the
vulgar
and
uneducated
mind
,
to
which
the
outward
sign
and
token
of
crime
be
ever
exciting
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
lack
of
clue
or
evidence
at
the
coroner
's
inquest
that
morning
.
 
<EOS>
the
shot
,
the
finding
of
the
body
,
the
subsequent
discovery
of
the
gun
,
be
rapidly
depose
to
;
and
then
the
policeman
who
have
interrupt
the
quarrel
between
Jem
Wilson
and
the
murder
young
man
be
bring
forward
,
and
give
his
evidence
,
clear
,
simple
,
and
straightforward
.
 
<EOS>
the
coroner
have
no
hesitation
,
the
jury
have
none
,
but
the
verdict
be
cautiously
word
.
 
<EOS>
"
wilful
murder
against
some
person
unknown
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
this
very
cautiousness
,
when
he
deem
the
thing
so
sure
as
to
require
no
caution
,
irritate
Mr.
Carson
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
not
soothe
him
that
the
superintendent
call
the
verdict
a
mere
form
,
 
exhibit
a
warrant
empower
him
to
seize
the
body
of
Jem
Wilson
commit
on
suspicion
,
 
declare
his
intention
of
employ
a
well
-
know
officer
in
the
Detective
Service
to
ascertain
the
ownership
of
the
gun
,
and
to
collect
other
evidence
,
especially
as
regard
the
young
woman
,
about
whom
the
policeman
depose
that
the
quarrel
have
take
place
;
Mr.
Carson
be
still
excited
and
irritable
;
restless
in
body
and
mind
.
 
<EOS>
He
make
every
preparation
for
the
accusation
of
Jem
the
following
morning
before
the
magistrate
:
he
engage
attorney
skilled
in
criminal
practice
to
watch
the
case
and
prepare
brief
;
he
write
to
celebrated
barrister
come
the
Northern
Circuit
,
to
bespeak
their
service
.
 
<EOS>
a
speedy
conviction
,
a
speedy
execution
,
seem
to
be
the
only
thing
that
would
satisfy
his
crave
thirst
for
blood
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
fain
be
policeman
,
magistrate
,
accuse
speaker
,
all
;
but
most
of
all
,
the
judge
,
rise
with
full
sentence
of
death
on
his
lip
.
  
<EOS>
that
afternoon
,
as
Jane
Wilson
have
begin
to
feel
the
effect
of
a
night

disturbed
rest

evince
in
frequent
dropping
off
to
sleep
,
while
she
sit
by
her
sister

in

bedside
,
lull
by
the
incessant
crooning
of
the

she
be
startle
by
a
man
speak
in
the
house

place
below

who
,
weary
of
knock
at
the

without
obtain
any

have
enter

be
call
lustily
for
   
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
when
Mrs.

catch
a

the
intruder
through
the

she
at
once
see
he
be
a
stranger
,
a
working

man
,
it
may
be
a
fellow

labourer
with
her
son
,
for
his
dress
be
grimy
enough
for
the
supposition
.
 
<EOS>
He
hold
a
gun
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
make
bold
to
ask
if
this
gun
belong
to
your
son
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
first
look
at
the
man
,
and
then
,
weary
and
half
asleep
,
not
see
any
reason
for
refuse
to
answer
the
inquiry
,
she
move
forward
to
examine
it

talk
while
she
look
for
certain
old

fashioned
ornament
on
the
stock

<EOS>
"
It
look
like

it
be

sure
enough

<EOS>
I
could
speak
to
it
anywhere
by

<EOS>
You
see
it
be
his
grandfather
be
as

gamekeeper
to
some

up

they
do

,
how

<EOS>
He

be

He

for
sure

now
his

so
ill

and
me
leave
all
alone

;
and
the
immediate
cause
of
her
anxiety
be
thus
recall
to
her

,
she
enter
on
a
long
story
of
Alice

the

any
further
information
he
could
;
and
then
,
say
he
be
in
a
hurry
,
he
turn
to
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
She
follow
him
to
the
door
,
still
tell
him
her
trouble
,
and
be
never
strike
,
until
it
be
too
late
to
ask
the
reason
,
with
the
unaccountableness
of
his
conduct
,
in
carry
the
gun
away
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
as
she
heavily
climb
the
stair
,
she
put
away
the
wonder
and
the
thought
about
his
conduct
,
by
determine
to
believe
he
be
some
workman
with
whom
her
son
have
make
some
arrangement
about
shoot
at
the
gallery
;
or
mend
the
old
weapon
;
or
something
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
enough
to
fret
her
,
without
moidere
herself
about
old
gun
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
have
give
it
to
him
to
bring
it
to
her
;
so
it
be
safe
enough
;
or
,
if
it
be
not
,
why
she
should
be
glad
never
to
set
eye
on
it
again
,
for
she
could
not
abide
firearm
,
they
be
so
apt
to
shoot
people
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
comfort
herself
for
the
want
of
thought
in
not
make
further
inquiry
,
she
fall
off
into
another
dose
,
feverish
,
dream
-
haunted
,
and
unrefreshing
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
policeman
walk
off
with
his
prize
,
with
an
odd
mixture
of
feeling
;
a
little
contempt
,
a
little
disappointment
,
and
a
good
deal
of
pity
.
 
<EOS>
the
contempt
and
the
disappointment
be
cause
by
the
widow
's
easy
admission
of
the
gun
be
her
son
's
property
,
and
her
manner
of
identify
it
by
the
ornament
.
 
<EOS>
He
like
an
attempt
to
baffle
him
;
he
be
accustomed
to
it
;
it
give
some
exercise
to
his
wit
and
his
shrewdness
.
 
<EOS>
there
would
be
no
fun
in
fox
-
hunting
,
if
Reynard
yield
himself
up
without
any
effort
to
escape
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
again
,
his
mother
's
milk
be
yet
in
him
,
policeman
,
officer
of
the
Detective
Service
though
he
be
;
and
he
feel
sorry
for
the
old
woman
,
whose
"
softness
"
have
give
such
material
assistance
in
identify
her
son
as
the
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
convey
the
gun
,
and
the
intelligence
he
have
gain
,
to
the
superintendent
;
and
the
result
be
,
that
,
in
a
short
time
afterwards
,
three
policeman
go
to
the
work
at
which
Jem
be
foreman
,
and
announce
their
errand
to
the
astonished
overseer
,
who
direct
them
to
the
part
of
the
foundry
where
Jem
be
then
superintend
a
casting
.
  
<EOS>
Dark
,
black
be
the
wall
,
the
ground
,
the
face
around
them
,
as
they
cross
the
yard
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
in
the
furnace
-
house
,
a
deep
and
lurid
red
glare
over
all
;
the
furnace
roar
with
mighty
flame
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
,
like
demon
,
in
their
fire
-
and

soot
colouring
,
stand
swart
around
,
await
the
moment
when
the
ton
of
solid
iron
should
have
melt
down
into
fiery
liquid
,
fit
to
be
pour
,
with
still
,
heavy
sound
,
into
the
delicate
moulding
of
fine
black
sand
,
prepare
to
receive
it

<EOS>
the
heat
be
intense
,
and
the
red
glare
grow
every
instant
more
fierce
;
the
policeman
stand
awed
with
the
novel
sight
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
black
figure
,
hold
strange

shape
bucket

shovel
,
come
athwart
the
deep

red
furnace
light
,
and
clear
and
brilliant
flow
forth
the
iron
into
the
appropriate
mould
.
 
<EOS>
the
buzz
of
voice
rise
again
;
there
be
time
to
speak
,
and
gasp
,
and
wipe
the
brow
;
and
then
one
by
one
,
the
man
disperse
to
some
other
branch
of
their
employment

and
then
the
other
two
step
forward
and
arrest
him
,
state
of
what
he
be
accuse
,
and
the
ground
of
the
accusation
.
 
<EOS>
He
offer
no
resistance
,
though
he
seem
surprised
;
but
call
a
fellow

workman
to
him
,
he
briefly
request
him
to
tell
his

change

to

then
,
again

she
reproach
herself
a

for
the
feeling

pleasure
she
experience

in
think
that
he

never

lightly
forwards

unheard

Mary

off

with

make
Mrs.

Mrs.

an
account

with
hung
head

she
instinctively
choose
the
short
cut
to
that
home
which
be

in
her
present
state
of

only
the
hiding

place
of
four

where
she
may
vent
her
agony
,
unseen
and
unnoticed
by
the
keen
unkind
world
without

where
no

and
turn
hastily
<EOS>
she
see
a
little
italian
boy
with
his
humble
show
-
box
,
a
white
mouse
,
or
some
such
thing

<EOS>
the
set
sun
cast
its
red
glow
on
his
face

otherwise
the
olive
complexion
would
have

very
pale

broken
English

the

<EOS>
"
hungry

<EOS>
so
hungry

"
  
<EOS>
and
as
if
to
aid
by
gesture
the
effect
of
the
solitary
word

he
point
to
his
mouth

with
its
white
quivering
lip

Mary
answer
him
impatiently
,
"
o

hunger

nothing
 
nothing

on

her
heart
upbraid
her
the
next
minute
with
her
unrelenting
speech

she
hastily
enter
her
door
and
seize
the
scanty
remnant
of
food
which
the
cupboard

she
retrace
her
step
to
the
place
where
the
little
hopeless
stranger
have
sink
down
by
his
mute
companion
in
loneliness
and
starvation
,
and
be
rain
down

as
he
speak
in
some
foreign
tongue

with
low
cry

"
Mamma

with
the
elasticity

heart
belong
to
childhood

spring
up
as
he
see
the
food
the
girl
bring
;
she
whose
face
,
lovely
in
its
woe
,
have
tempt
him
first
to
address
her
;
and
,
with
the
graceful
courtesy
of
his
country
,
he
look
up
and
smile
while
he
kiss
her
hand
,
and
then
pour
forth
his
thank
,
and
share
her
bounty
with
his
little
pet
companion

<EOS>
She
stand
an
instant
,
divert
from
the
thought
of
her
own
grief
by
the
sight
of
his
infantine
gladness
;
and
then
bend
down
and
kiss
his
smooth
forehead
,
she
leave
him
,
and
seek
to
be
alone
with
her
agony
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
She
re
-
enter
the
house
,
lock
the
door
,
and
tear
off
her
bonnet
,
as
if
greedy
of
every
moment
which
take
her
from
the
full
indulgence
of
painful
,
despair
think
.
  
<EOS>
then
she
throw
herself
on
the
ground
,
yes
,
on
the
hard
flag
she
throw
her
soft
limb
down
;
and
the
comb
fall
out
of
her
hair
,
and
those
bright
tress
sweep
the
dusty
floor
,
while
she
pillow
and
hide
her
face
on
her
arm
,
and
burst
forth
into
loud
,
suffocate
sobs
.
  
<EOS>
o
earth
!
<EOS>
thou
didst
seem
but
a
dreary
dwelling
-
place
for
thy
poor
child
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
none
to
comfort
,
none
to
pity
!
 
<EOS>
and
self
-
reproach
gnawing
at
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
oh
,
why
do
she
ever
listen
to
the
tempter
?
 
<EOS>
why
do
she
ever
give
ear
to
her
own
suggestion
,
and
craving
after
wealth
and
grandeur
?
<EOS>
why
have
she
think
it
a
fine
thing
to
have
a
rich
lover
?
  
<EOS>
She
 
she
have
deserve
it
all
:
but
he
be
the
victim
,
 
he
,
the
beloved
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
conjecture
<EOS>
,
she
could
not
even
pause
to
think
who
have
reveal
,
or
how
he
have
discover
her
acquaintance
with
Harry
Carson
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
but
too
clear
,
<EOS>
some
way
or
another
,
he
have
learn
all
;
and
what
would
he
think
of
her
?
 
<EOS>
no
hope
of
his
love
,
 
<EOS>
oh
,
that
she
would
give
up
,
and
be
content
:
it
be
his
life
,
his
precious
life
,
that
be
threaten
!
 
<EOS>
then
she
try
to
recall
the
particular
,
which
,
when
Mrs.
Wilson
have
give
them
,
have
fall
but
upon
a
deafen
ear
,
 
something
about
a
gun
,
a
quarrel
,
which
she
could
not
remember
clearly
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
how
terrible
to
think
of
his
crime
,
his
blood
-
guiltiness
;
he
who
have
hitherto
be
so
good
,
so
noble
,
and
now
an
assassin
!
 
<EOS>
and
then
she
shrink
from
him
in
thought
;
and
then
,
with
bitter
remorse
,
clung
more
closely
to
his
image
with
passionate
self
-
upbraiding
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
not
she
who
have
lead
him
to
the
pit
into
which
he
have
fall
?
 
<EOS>
be
she
to
blame
him
?
 
<EOS>
She
to
judge
him
?
 
<EOS>
who
could
tell
how
madden
he
may
have
be
by
jealousy
;
how
one
moment
's
uncontrollable
passion
may
have
lead
him
to
become
a
murderer
!
 
<EOS>
and
she
have
blame
him
in
her
heart
after
his
last
deprecating
,
imploring
,
prophetic
speech
!
  
<EOS>
then
she
burst
out
cry
afresh
;
and
when
weary
of
crying
,
fall
to
think
again
.
 
<EOS>
the
gallow
!
 
<EOS>
the
gallow
!
 
<EOS>
Black
it
stand
against
the
burn
light
which
dazzle
her
shut
eye
,
press
on
them
as
she
would
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
she
be
go
mad
;
and
for
awhile
she
lie
outwardly
still
,
but
with
the
pulse
career
through
her
head
with
wild
vehemence
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
come
a
strange
forgetfulness
of
the
present
,
in
thought
of
the
long
-
past
time
;
 
of
those
day
when
she
hide
her
face
on
her
mother
's
pitying
,
love
bosom
,
and
hear
tender
word
of
comfort
,
be
her
grief
or
her
error
<EOS>
what
it
may
;
 
of
those
day
when
she
have
feel
as
if
her
mother
's
love
be
too
mighty
not
to
last
for
ever
;
 
of
those
day
when
hunger
have
be
to
her
(
as
to
the
little
stranger
she
have
that
evening
relieve
)
something
to
be
think
about
,
and
mourn
over
;
 
when
Jem
and
she
have
play
together
;
<EOS>
he
,
with
the
condescension
of
an
old
child
,
and
she
,
with
unconscious
earnestness
,
believe
that
he
be
as
much
gratify
with
important
trifle
as
she
be
;
 
when
her
father
be
a
cheery
-
hearted
man
,
rich
in
the
love
of
his
wife
,
and
the
companionship
of
his
friend
;
 
when
(
for
it
still
work
round
to
that
)
,
when
mother
be
alive
,
and
he
be
not
a
murderer
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
Heaven
bless
her
unaware
,
and
she
sink
from
remember
,
to
wander
,
unconnected
thought
,
and
thence
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
it
be
sleep
,
though
in
that
strange
posture
,
on
that
hard
cold
bed
;
and
she
dreamt
of
the
happy
time
of
long
ago
,
and
her
mother
come
to
her
,
and
kiss
her
as
she
lie
,
and
once
more
the
dead
be
alive
again
in
that
happy
world
of
dream
.
 
<EOS>
all
be
restore
to
the
gladness
of
childhood
,
even
to
the
little
kitten
which
have
be
her
playmate
and
bosom
friend
then
,
and
which
have
be
long
forget
in
her
wake
hour
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
love
one
be
there
!
  
<EOS>
She
suddenly
waken
!
 
<EOS>
clear
and
wide
awake
!
 
<EOS>
some
noise
have
startle
her
from
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
She
sit
up
,
and
put
her
hair
(
still
wet
with
tear
)
back
from
her
flushed
cheek
,
and
listen
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
she
could
only
hear
her
beat
heart
.
 
<EOS>
all
be
still
without
,
for
it
be
after
midnight
,
such
hour
of
agony
have
pass
away
;
but
the
moon
shine
clearly
in
at
the
unshuttered
window
,
make
the
room
almost
as
light
as
day
,
in
its
cold
ghastly
radiance
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
low
knock
at
the
door
!
 
<EOS>
a
strange
feeling
creep
over
Mary
's
heart
,
as
if
something
spiritual
be
near
;
as
if
the
dead
,
so
lately
present
in
her
dream
,
be
yet
glide
and
hover
round
her
,
with
their
dim
,
dread
form
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
why
dread
?
 
<EOS>
have
they
not
love
her
?
 
<EOS>
and
who
love
her
now
?
 
<EOS>
be
she
not
lonely
enough
to
welcome
the
spirit
of
the
dead
,
who
have
love
her
while
here
?
 
<EOS>
if
her
mother
have
conscious
being
,
her
love
for
her
child
endure
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
quiet
her
fear
,
and
listen
 
listen
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
Mary
!
open
the
door
!
"
<EOS>
as
a
little
movement
on
her
part
seem
to
tell
the
being
outside
of
her
wakeful
,
watchful
state
.
<EOS>
They
be
the
accent
of
her
mother
's
voice
;
the
very
south
-
country
pronunciation
,
that
Mary
so
well
remember
;
and
which
she
have
sometimes
try
to
imitate
when
alone
,
with
the
fond
mimicry
of
affection
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
without
fear
,
without
hesitation
,
she
rise
and
unbar
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
against
the
moonlight
,
stand
a
form
,
so
closely
resemble
her
dead
mother
,
that
Mary
never
doubt
the
identity
,
but
exclaim
(
as
if
she
be
a
terrified
child
,
secure
of
safety
when
near
the
protect
care
of
its
parent
)
    
"
o
mother

<EOS>
mother
!
<EOS>
you

"
<EOS>
she
throw
herself
,
or
rather
fall
,
into
the
tremble
arm
of
her
long
-
lose
,
unrecognised
aunt
,
Esther

<EOS>
ESTHER

in
SEEKING
MARY

MARGARET

SONG

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
must
go
back
a
little
to
explain
the
motive
which
cause
Esther
to
seek
an
interview
with
her
niece
.
  
<EOS>
the
murder
have
be
commit
early
on
Thursday
night
,
and
between
then
and
the
dawn
of
the
following
day
there
be
ample
time
for
the
news
to
spread
far
and
wide
among
all
those
whose
duty
,
or
whose
want
,
or
whose
error
,
cause
them
to
be
abroad
in
the
street
of
Manchester
.
  
<EOS>
among
those
who
listen
to
the
tale
of
violence
be
Esther
.
  
<EOS>
a
craving
desire
to
know
more
take
possession
of
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
far
away
as
she
be
from
Turner
Street
,
she
immediately
set
off
to
the
scene
of
the
murder
,
which
be
faintly
light
by
the
grey
dawn
as
she
reach
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
quiet
and
still
that
she
could
hardly
believe
it
to
be
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
the
only
vestige
of
any
scuffle
or
violence
be
a
trail
on
the
dust
,
as
if
somebody
have
be
lie
there
,
and
then
be
raise
by
extraneous
force
.
 
<EOS>
the
little
bird
be
begin
to
hop
and
twitt
in
the
leafless
hedge
,
make
the
only
sound
that
be
near
and
distinct
.
 
<EOS>
She
cross
into
the
field
where
she
guess
the
murderer
to
have
stand
;
it
be
easy
of
access
,
for
the
worn
,
stunted
hawthorn
-
hedge
have
many
gap
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
night
-
smell
of
bruise
grass
come
up
from
under
her
foot
,
as
she
go
towards
the
saw
-
pit
and
carpenter
's
shed
which
,
as
I
have
say
before
,
be
in
a
corner
of
the
field
near
the
road
,
and
where
one
of
her
informant
have
tell
her
it
be
suppose
by
the
police
that
the
murderer
have
lurk
while
wait
for
his
victim
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
sign
,
however
,
that
any
one
have
be
about
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
grass
have
be
bruise
or
bent
where
he
have
trod
,
it
have
have
enough
of
the
elasticity
of
life
to
raise
itself
under
the
dewy
influence
of
night
.
 
<EOS>
She
hush
her
breath
in
involuntary
awe
,
but
nothing
else
tell
of
the
violent
deed
by
which
a
fellow
-
creature
have
pass
away
.
<EOS>
She
stand
still
for
a
minute
,
imagine
to
herself
the
position
of
the
party
,
guide
by
the
only
circumstance
which
afford
any
evidence
,
the
trail
mark
on
the
dust
in
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
suddenly
(
it
be
before
the
sun
have
rise
above
the
horizon
)
<EOS>
she
become
aware
of
something
white
in
the
hedge
.
 
<EOS>
all
other
colour
wear
the
same
murky
hue
,
though
the
form
of
object
be
perfectly
distinct
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
it
?
 
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
a
flower
;
 
that
,
the
time
of
year
make
clear
.
 
<EOS>
a
frozen
lump
of
snow
,
linger
late
in
one
of
the
gnarled
tuft
of
the
hedge
?
 
<EOS>
She
step
forward
to
examine
.
 
<EOS>
It
prove
to
be
a
little
piece
of
stiff
writing
-
paper
compress
into
a
round
shape
.
 
<EOS>
She
understand
it
instantly
;
it
be
the
paper
that
have
serve
as
wad
for
the
murderer
's
gun
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
have
be
stand
just
where
the
murderer
must
have
be
but
a
few
hour
before
;
probably
(
as
the
rumour
have
spread
through
the
town
,
reach
her
ear
)
<EOS>
one
of
the
poor
madden
turn
-
out
,
who
hang
about
everywhere
,
with
black
,
fierce
look
,
as
if
contemplate
some
deed
of
violence
.
 
<EOS>
Her
sympathy
be
all
with
them
,
for
she
have
know
what
they
suffer
;
and
besides
this
,
there
be
her
own
individual
dislike
of
Mr.
Carson
,
and
dread
of
him
for
Mary
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
yet
,
poor
Mary
!
 
<EOS>
death
be
<EOS>
a
terrible
,
though
sure
,
remedy
for
the
evil
Esther
have
dread
for
her
;
and
how
would
she
stand
the
shock
,
love
as
her
aunt
believe
her
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
Poor
Mary
!
<EOS>
who
would
comfort
her
?
<EOS>
Esther
's
thought
begin
to
picture
her
sorrow
,
her
despair
,
when
the
news
of
her
lover
's
death
should
reach
her
;
and
she
long
to
tell
her
there
may
have
be
a
keen
grief
yet
have
he
live
.
  
<EOS>
bright
,
beautiful
come
the
slant
ray
of
the
morning
sun
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
time
for
such
as
she
to
hide
themselves
,
with
the
other
obscene
thing
of
night
,
from
the
glorious
light
of
day
,
which
be
only
for
the
happy
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
turn
her
step
towards
town
,
still
hold
the
paper
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
get
over
the
hedge
it
encumber
her
to
hold
it
in
her
clasped
hand
,
and
she
throw
it
down
.
 
<EOS>
She
pass
on
a
few
step
,
her
thought
still
of
Mary
,
till
the
idea
cross
her
mind
,
<EOS>
could
it
(
blank
as
it
appear
to
be
)
give
any
clue
to
the
murderer
?
<EOS>
as
I
say
before
,
her
sympathy
be
all
on
that
side
,
so
she
turn
back
and
pick
it
up
;
and
then
feel
as
if
in
some
measure
an
accessory
,
she
hide
it
unexamine
in
her
hand
,
and
hastily
pass
out
of
the
street
at
the
opposite
end
to
that
by
which
she
have
enter
it
.
  
<EOS>
and
what
do
you
think
she
feel
,
when
have
walk
some
distance
from
the
spot
,
she
dare
to
open
the
crushed
paper
,
and
see
write
on
it
Mary
Barton
's
name
,
and
not
only
that
,
but
the
street
in
which
she
live
!
 
<EOS>
true
,
a
letter
or
two
be
tear
off
,
but
,
nevertheless
,
there
be
the
name
clear
to
be
recognise
.
 
<EOS>
and
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
what
terrible
thought
flash
into
her
mind
;
or
be
it
only
fancy
?
 
<EOS>
but
it
look
very
like
the
writing
which
she
have
once
know
<EOS>
well
 
<EOS>
the
writing
of
Jem
Wilson
,
who
,
when
she
live
at
her
brother
-
in
-
law
's
,
and
he
be
a
near
neighbour
,
have
often
be
employ
by
her
to
write
her
letter
to
people
,
to
whom
she
be
ashamed
of
send
her
own
misspelt
scrawl
.
 
<EOS>
She
remember
the
wonderful
flourish
she
have
so
much
admire
in
those
day
,
while
she
sit
by
dictate
,
and
Jem
,
in
all
the
pride
of
newly
-
acquire
penmanship
,
use
to
dazzle
her
eye
by
extraordinary
grace
and
twirl
.
  
<EOS>
if
it
be
his
!
  
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
merely
that
her
head
be
run
so
on
Mary
,
that
she
be
associate
every
trifle
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
as
if
only
one
person
write
in
that
flourish
,
meander
style
!
  
<EOS>
It
be
enough
to
fill
her
mind
to
think
from
what
she
may
have
save
Mary
by
secure
the
paper
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
look
at
it
just
once
more
,
and
see
if
some
very
dense
and
stupid
policeman
could
have
mistake
the
name
,
or
if
Mary
would
certainly
have
be
drag
into
notice
in
the
affair
.
  
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
no
one
could
have
mistake
the
"
ry
Barton
,
"
and
it
be
Jem
's
handwriting
!
  
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
if
it
be
so
,
she
understand
it
all
,
and
she
have
be
the
cause
!
<EOS>
with
her
violent
and
unregulated
nature
,
render
morbid
by
the
course
of
life
she
lead
,
and
her
consciousness
of
her
degradation
,
she
curse
herself
for
the
interference
which
she
believe
have
lead
to
this
;
for
the
information
and
the
warning
she
have
give
to
Jem
,
which
have
rouse
him
to
this
murderous
action
.
 
<EOS>
how
could
she
,
the
abandon
and
polluted
outcast
,
ever
have
dare
to
hope
for
a
blessing
,
even
on
her
effort
to
do
good
.
 
<EOS>
the
black
curse
of
Heaven
rest
on
all
her
doing
,
be
they
for
good
or
for
evil
.
  
<EOS>
poor
,
disease
mind
!
<EOS>
and
there
be
none
to
minister
to
thee
!
  
<EOS>
so
she
wander
about
,
too
restless
to
take
her
usual
heavy
morning
's
sleep
,
up
and
down
the
street
,
greedily
listen
to
every
word
of
the
passer
-
by
,
and
loiter
near
each
group
of
talker
,
anxious
to
scrape
together
every
morsel
of
information
,
or
conjecture
,
or
suspicion
,
though
without
possess
any
definite
purpose
in
all
this
.
 
<EOS>
and
ever
and
always
she
clench
the
scrap
of
paper
which
may
betray
so
much
,
until
her
nail
have
deeply
indent
the
palm
of
her
hand
;
so
fearful
be
she
in
her
nervous
dread
,
<EOS>
lest
unaware
<EOS>
she
should
let
it
drop
.
  
<EOS>
towards
the
middle
of
the
day
she
could
no
longer
evade
the
body
's
craving
want
of
rest
and
refreshment
;
but
the
rest
be
take
in
a
spirit
vault
,
and
the
refreshment
be
a
glass
of
gin
.
  
<EOS>
then
she
start
up
from
the
stupor
she
have
take
for
repose
;
and
suddenly
drive
before
the
gusty
impulse
of
her
mind
,
she
push
her
way
to
the
place
where
at
that
very
time
the
police
be
bring
the
information
they
have
gather
with
regard
to
the
all
-
engross
murder
.
  
<EOS>
She
listen
with
painful
acuteness
of
comprehension
to
drop
word
,
and
unconnected
sentence
,
the
meaning
of
which
become
clear
,
and
yet
more
clear
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
be
suspect
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
be
ascertain
to
be
the
murderer
.
  
<EOS>
She
see
him
(
although
he
,
absorb
in
deep
sad
thought
,
see
her
not
)
,
she
see
him
bring
handcuff
and
guard
out
of
the
coach
.
<EOS>
She
see
him
enter
the
station
 
<EOS>
she
gasp
for
breath
till
he
come
out
,
still
handcuff
,
and
still
guard
,
to
be
convey
to
the
New
Bailey
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
the
only
one
who
have
speak
to
her
with
hope
that
she
may
win
her
way
back
to
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
His
word
have
linger
in
her
heart
with
a
sort
of
call
to
heaven
,
like
distant
Sabbath
bell
,
although
in
her
despair
she
have
turn
away
from
his
voice
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
the
only
one
who
have
speak
to
her
kindly
.
 
<EOS>
the
murder
,
shocking
though
it
be
,
be
an
absent
,
abstract
thing
,
on
which
her
thought
could
not
,
and
would
not
dwell
:
<EOS>
all
that
be
present
in
her
mind
be
Jem
's
danger
,
and
his
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
then
Mary
come
to
remembrance
.
 
<EOS>
Esther
wonder
till
she
be
sick
of
wonder
,
in
what
way
she
be
take
the
affair
.
 
<EOS>
in
some
manner
it
would
be
a
terrible
blow
for
the
poor
,
motherless
girl
;
with
her
dreadful
father
,
too
,
who
be
to
esther
a
sort
of
accuse
angel
.
  
<EOS>
She
set
off
towards
the
court
where
Mary
live
,
to
pick
up
what
she
could
there
of
information
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
be
ashamed
to
enter
in
where
once
she
have
be
innocent
,
and
hang
about
the
neighbouring
street
,
not
daring
to
question
,
so
she
learn
but
little
;
nothing
,
in
fact
,
but
the
knowledge
of
John
Barton
's
absence
from
home
.
  
<EOS>
She
go
up
a
dark
entry
to
rest
her
weary
limb
on
a
doorstep
and
think
.
 
<EOS>
Her
elbow
on
her
knee
,
her
face
hide
in
her
hand
,
she
try
to
gather
together
and
arrange
her
thought
.
 
<EOS>
but
still
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
she
open
her
hand
to
see
if
the
paper
be
yet
there
.
  
<EOS>
She
get
up
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
form
a
plan
,
and
have
a
course
of
action
to
look
forward
to
that
would
satisfy
one
craving
desire
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
the
time
be
long
go
by
when
there
be
much
wisdom
or
consistency
in
her
project
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
get
late
,
and
that
be
so
much
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
She
go
to
a
pawnshop
,
and
take
off
her
finery
in
a
back
room
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
know
by
the
people
,
and
have
a
character
for
honesty
,
so
she
have
no
very
great
difficulty
in
induce
them
to
let
her
have
a
suit
of
outer
clothe
,
befit
the
wife
of
a
working
-
man
,
a
black
silk
bonnet
,
a
print
gown
,
a
plaid
shawl
,
dirty
and
rather
worn
to
be
sure
,
but
which
have
a
sort
of
sanctity
to
the
eye
of
the
street
-
walker
as
be
the
appropriate
garb
of
that
happy
class
to
which
she
could
never
,
never
more
belong
.
  
<EOS>
She
look
at
herself
in
the
little
glass
which
hang
against
the
wall
,
and
sadly
shake
her
head
<EOS>
think
how
easy
be
the
duty
of
that
Eden
of
innocence
from
which
she
be
shut
out
;
how
she
would
work
,
and
toil
,
and
starve
,
and
die
,
if
necessary
,
for
a
husband
,
a
home
 
for
child
 
<EOS>
but
that
think
she
could
not
bear
;
a
little
form
rise
up
,
stern
in
its
innocence
,
from
the
witch
'
caldron
of
her
imagination
,
and
she
rush
into
action
again
.
  
<EOS>
You
know
now
how
she
come
to
stand
by
the
threshold
of
Mary
's
door
,
wait
,
tremble
,
until
the
latch
be
lift
,
and
her
niece
,
with
word
that
speak
of
such
desolation
among
the
living
,
fall
into
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
feel
as
if
some
holy
spell
would
prevent
her
(
even
as
the
unholy
Lady
Geraldine
be
prevent
,
in
the
abode
of
Christabel
)
from
cross
the
threshold
of
that
home
of
her
early
innocence
;
and
she
have
mean
to
wait
for
an
invitation
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mary
's
helpless
action
do
away
with
all
reluctant
feeling
,
and
she
bear
or
drag
her
to
her
seat
,
and
look
on
her
bewilder
eye
,
as
,
puzzle
with
the
likeness
,
which
be
not
identity
<EOS>
,
she
gaze
on
her
aunt
's
feature
.
  
<EOS>
in
pursuance
of
her
plan
,
Esther
mean
to
assume
the
manner
and
character
,
as
she
have
do
the
dress
,
of
a
mechanic
's
wife
;
but
then
,
to
account
for
her
long
absence
,
and
her
long
silence
towards
all
that
ought
to
have
be
dear
to
her
,
it
be
necessary
that
she
should
put
on
an
indifference
far
distant
from
her
heart
,
which
be
love
and
yearning
,
in
spite
of
all
its
fault
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
perhaps
,
she
over
-
act
her
part
,
for
<EOS>
certainly
Mary
feel
a
kind
of
repugnance
to
the
change
and
alter
aunt
,
who
so
suddenly
reappear
on
the
scene
;
and
it
would
have
cut
Esther
to
the
very
core
,
could
she
have
know
how
her
little
darling
of
former
day
be
feel
towards
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
remember
me
,
I
see
,
Mary
!
"
<EOS>
she
begin
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
long
while
since
I
leave
you
all
,
to
be
sure
;
and
I
,
many
a
time
,
thought
of
come
to
see
you
,
and
 
and
your
father
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
live
so
far
off
,
and
be
always
so
busy
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
do
just
what
I
wish
.
 
<EOS>
You
recollect
aunt
Esther
,
do
not
you
,
Mary
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
Aunt
Hetty
?
"
ask
Mary
faintly
,
still
look
at
the
face
which
be
so
different
from
the
old
recollection
of
her
aunt
's
fresh
dazzling
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
I
be
Aunt
Hetty
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
it
be
so
long
since
I
hear
that
name
,
"
sigh
forth
the
thought
it
suggest
;
then
,
recover
herself
,
and
strive
after
the
hard
character
she
wish
to
assume
,
she
continue
:
"
and
to
-
day
I
hear
a
friend
of
yours
,
and
of
mine
too
,
long
ago
,
be
in
trouble
,
and
I
guess
you
would
be
in
sorrow
<EOS>
,
so
I
think
I
would
just
step
this
far
and
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
's
tear
flow
afresh
,
but
she
have
no
desire
to
open
her
heart
to
her
strangely
-
find
aunt
,
who
have
,
by
her
own
confession
,
keep
aloof
from
and
neglect
them
for
so
many
year
.
 
<EOS>
yet
she
try
to
feel
grateful
for
kindness
(
however
late
)
from
any
one
,
and
wish
to
be
civil
.
 
<EOS>
moreover
,
she
have
a
strong
disinclination
to
speak
on
the
terrible
subject
uppermost
in
her
mind
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
after
a
pause
,
she
say
   
"
thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
mean
very
kind
.
 
<EOS>
have
you
have
a
long
walk
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
sorry
,
"
say
she
,
rise
with
a
sudden
thought
,
which
be
as
suddenly
check
by
recollection
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
nothing
to
eat
in
the
house
,
and
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
must
be
hungry
,
after
your
walk
.
"
  
<EOS>
for
Mary
conclude
that
certainly
her
aunt
's
residence
must
be
far
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
,
out
of
sight
or
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
after
all
,
she
do
not
think
much
about
her
;
her
heart
be
so
aching
-
full
of
other
thing
,
that
all
besides
seem
like
a
dream
.
<EOS>
She
receive
feeling
and
impression
from
her
conversation
with
her
aunt
,
but
do
not
,
could
not
,
put
them
together
,
or
think
or
argue
about
them
.
  
<EOS>
and
Esther
!
<EOS>
how
scanty
have
be
her
food
for
day
and
week
,
her
thinly
-
cover
bone
and
pale
lip
may
tell
,
but
her
word
should
never
reveal
!
  
<EOS>
so
,
with
a
little
unreal
laugh
,
she
reply
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Mary
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
do
not
talk
about
eat
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
the
good
of
everything
,
and
plenty
of
it
,
for
my
husband
be
in
good
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
such
a
supper
before
I
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
touch
a
morsel
if
you
have
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
word
shoot
a
strange
pang
through
Mary
's
heart
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
always
remember
her
aunt
's
loving
and
unselfish
disposition
;
how
be
it
change
,
if
,
live
in
plenty
,
she
have
never
think
it
worth
while
to
ask
after
her
relation
who
be
all
but
starving
!
 
<EOS>
She
shut
up
her
heart
instinctively
against
her
aunt
.
  
<EOS>
and
all
the
time
poor
Esther
be
swallow
her
sobs
,
and
over
-
act
her
part
,
and
control
herself
more
than
she
have
do
for
many
a
long
day
,
in
order
that
her
niece
may
not
be
shock
and
revolt
,
by
the
knowledge
of
what
her
aunt
have
become
 
a
prostitute
;
an
outcast
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
long
to
open
her
wretched
,
wretched
heart
,
so
hopeless
,
so
abandon
by
all
live
thing
,
to
one
who
have
love
her
once
;
and
yet
she
refrain
,
from
dread
of
the
averted
eye
,
the
alter
voice
,
the
internal
loathing
,
which
she
fear
such
disclosure
may
create
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
go
straight
to
the
subject
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
tarry
long
,
for
she
feel
unable
to
support
the
character
she
have
assume
for
any
length
of
time
.
  
<EOS>
They
sit
by
the
little
round
table
,
face
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
the
candle
be
place
right
between
them
,
and
Esther
move
it
in
order
to
have
a
clear
view
of
Mary
's
face
,
so
that
she
may
read
her
emotion
,
and
ascertain
her
interest
.
  
<EOS>
then
she
begin
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
bad
business
<EOS>
,
I
be
afraid
,
this
of
Mr.
Carson
's
murder
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
wince
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
Jem
Wilson
be
take
up
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
cover
her
eye
with
her
hand
,
as
if
to
shade
them
from
the
light
,
and
esther
herself
,
less
accustomed
to
self
-
command
,
be
get
too
much
agitate
for
calm
observation
of
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
take
a
walk
near
Turner
Street
,
and
I
go
to
see
the
spot
,
"
continue
Esther
,
"
and
,
as
luck
would
have
it
<EOS>
,
I
spy
this
bit
of
paper
in
the
hedge
,
"
produce
the
precious
piece
still
fold
in
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
have
be
use
as
wad
for
the
gun
,
I
reckon
;
indeed
,
that
be
clear
enough
,
from
the
shape
it
be
cram
into
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
for
the
murderer
<EOS>
,
whoever
he
may
be
(
I
do
not
then
know
of
Jem
's
be
suspect
)
,
and
I
think
I
would
never
leave
a
thing
about
as
may
help
,
ever
so
little
,
to
convict
him
;
the
police
be
so
'
cute
about
straw
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
carry
it
a
little
way
,
and
then
I
open
it
and
see
your
name
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
take
her
hand
away
from
her
eye
,
and
look
with
surprise
at
her
aunt
's
face
,
as
she
utter
these
word
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
kind
after
all
,
for
be
she
not
save
her
from
be
summon
,
and
from
be
question
and
examine
;
a
thing
to
be
dread
above
all
other
:
as
she
feel
sure
that
her
unwilling
answer
,
frame
them
how
she
may
,
would
add
to
the
suspicion
against
Jem
;
her
aunt
be
indeed
kind
,
to
think
of
what
would
spare
her
this
.
  
<EOS>
Esther
go
on
,
without
notice
Mary
's
look
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
action
of
speaking
be
so
painful
to
her
,
and
so
much
interrupt
by
the
hard
,
rake
little
cough
,
which
have
be
her
constant
annoyance
for
month
,
that
she
be
too
much
engross
by
the
physical
difficulty
of
utterance
,
to
be
a
very
close
observer
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
could
be
no
mistake
if
they
have
find
it
.
 
<EOS>
look
at
your
name
,
together
with
the
very
name
of
this
court
!
 
<EOS>
and
in
Jem
's
handwriting
too
,
<EOS>
or
I
be
much
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
Look
,
Mary
!
"
  
<EOS>
and
now
she
do
watch
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
take
the
paper
and
flatten
it
;
then
suddenly
stand
stiff
up
,
with
irrepressible
movement
,
as
if
petrify
by
some
horror
abruptly
disclose
;
her
face
,
strung
and
rigid
;
her
lip
compress
tight
,
to
keep
down
some
rise
exclamation
.
 
<EOS>
She
drop
on
her
seat
,
as
suddenly
as
if
the
brace
muscle
have
in
an
instant
give
way
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
speak
no
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
his
handwriting
 
be
not
it
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Esther
,
though
Mary
's
manner
be
almost
confirmation
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
tell
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
will
tell
?
<EOS>
"
demand
Mary
,
in
a
tone
so
sternly
earnest
,
as
almost
to
be
threaten
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Mary
,
"
say
Esther
,
rather
reproachfully
,
"
I
be
not
so
bad
as
that
.
 
<EOS>
o
Mary
,
you
can
not
think
I
would
do
that
,
whatever
I
may
be

"
  
<EOS>
the
tear
spring
to
her
eye
at
the
idea
that
she
be
suspect
of
be
one
who
would
help
to
inform
against
an
old
friend

<EOS>
Mary
catch
her
sad
and
upbraiding
look

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no

<EOS>
I
know
you
would
not

aunt

I
do
not

what
I

I
be
so
shocked

Mary
sit
still
look
at
the
writing
,
and
turn
the
paper
round
with
careful
examination
,
try
to
hope
,
but
her
very
fear
belie
her
hope

<EOS>
"
I
think
you
care
for
the
young
man
that
be
murder
,
"
observe
Esther
,
half
-
aloud
;
but
feel
that
she
could
not
mistake
this
strange
interest
in
the
suspect
murderer
,
imply
by
Mary
's
eagerness
to
screen
him
from
anything
which
may
strengthen
suspicion
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
come
,
desirous
to
know
the
extent
of
Mary
's
grief
for
Mr.
Carson
,
and
glad
of
the
excuse
afford
her
by
the
important
scrap
of
paper

<EOS>
Her
remark
about
its

Jem

handwriting
<EOS>
,
she
have
,
with
this
view
of
ascertain
Mary
's
state
of
feeling
,
feel
to
be
most
imprudent
the
instant
after
she
have
utter
it
;
but
Mary
's
anxiety
that
she
should
not
tell
be
too
great
,
and
too
decide
,
to
leave
a
doubt
as
to
her
interest
for
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
She
grow
more
and
more
bewildered
,
and
her
dizzy
head
refuse
to
reason
.
<EOS>
Mary
never
speak
.
 
<EOS>
She
hold
the
bit
of
paper
firmly
,
determine
to
retain
possession
of
it
<EOS>
,
come
what

and
anxious

for
her
aunt

go

<EOS>
as
she
sit
,
her
face
bear
a
likeness
to
Esther

dead
child

<EOS>
"
You
be
so
like
my
little
girl
,
Mary

"
<EOS>
say
Esther
,
weary
of
the
one
subject
on
which
she
could
get
no
satisfaction
,
and
recur
,
with
full
heart
,
to
the
thought
of
the
dead

<EOS>
Mary
look
up

<EOS>
Her
aunt
have
child

then

<EOS>
that

all

she
receive

<EOS>
no
faint
imagination
of
the
love
and
the
woe
of
that
poor

her
mind

she
would
have
take
her

all
guilty

err
,
to
her

try
to
bind
up
the
broken
heart

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
it

not

<EOS>
Her
aunt
have
child

then
;
and
she
be
on
the
point
of
put
some
question
about
them
,
but
before
it
could
be
speak
another
thought
turn
it
aside
,
and
she
go
back
to
her
task
of
unravel
the
mystery
of
the
paper
,
and
the
handwriting

<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
she
wish
her
aunt
would
go

intenseness

her
power

although
the
wish
be
unexpresse

Esther
feel
herself
unwelcome

and
that
her
absence
be
desire

<EOS>
She
feel
this
some
time
before
she
could
summon
up
resolution
to
go
.
<EOS>
She
be
so
much
disappointed
in
this
long
-
for
,
dreaded
interview
with
Mary
;
she
have
wish
to
impose
upon
her
with
her
tale
of
married
respectability

and
yet
she
have
yearn
and
crave
for
sympathy
in
her
real
lot

and
she
have
impose
upon
her
well

<EOS>
She
should
perhaps
be
glad
of
it
afterwards
;
but
her
desolation
of
hope
seem
for
the
time
redouble

<EOS>
and
she
must
leave
the
old
dwelling

place
,
<EOS>
whose
very
wall
,
and
flag
,
dingy
and
sordid
as
they
be

have
a
charm
for
her

<EOS>
Must
leave
the
abode
of
poverty

for
the
more
terrible
abode

She

terrible

thus

so

up

,
to

her

push
her
off

the
word

She
rush
into

outer

weep
long

bitterly

MARY

<EOS>
no
sooner
be
Mary
alone
than
she
fasten
the
door
,
and
put
the
shutter
up
against
the
window
,
which
have
all
this
time
remain
shade
only
by
the
curtain
hastily
draw
together
on
Esther

entrance

the
lighting

She
do
all
this
with
the
same
compress
lip

and
the
same
stony
look
that
her
face
have
assume
on
the
first
examination
of
the
paper

<EOS>
then
she
sit
down
for
an
instant

think
;

rise
directly
,
go
,
with

up

pass

into
her

<EOS>
what
do
she
want
there
?
  
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
;
I
must
put
into
word
the
dreadful
secret
which
she
believe
that
bit
of
paper
have
reveal
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
be
the
murderer
.
  
<EOS>
that
corner
of
stiff
,
shining
,
thick
,
write
paper
,
she
recognise
as
a
part
of
the
sheet
on
which
she
have
copy
Samuel
Bamford
's
beautiful
line
so
many
month
ago
 
copy
(
as
you
perhaps
remember
)
on
the
blank
part
of
a
valentine
send
to
her
by
Jem
Wilson
,
in
those
day
when
she
do
not
treasure
and
hoard
up
everything
he
have
touch
,
as
she
would
do
now
.
  
<EOS>
that
copy
have
be
give
to
her
father
,
for
whom
it
be
make
,
and
she
have
occasionally
see
him
read
it
over
,
not
<EOS>
a
fortnight
ago
she
be
sure
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
resolve
to
ascertain
if
the
other
part
still
remain
in
his
possession
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
 
<EOS>
it
be
just
possible
<EOS>
he
MIGHT
,
have
give
it
away
to
some
friend
;
and
if
so
,
that
person
be
the
guilty
one
,
for
she
could
swear
to
the
paper
anywhere
.
  
<EOS>
first
of
all
she
pull
out
every
article
from
the
little
old
chest
of
drawer
.
 
<EOS>
amongst
them
be
some
thing
which
have
belong
to
her
mother
,
but
she
have
no
time
now
to
examine
and
try
and
remember
them
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
reverence
she
could
pay
them
be
to
carry
them
and
lie
them
on
the
bed
carefully
,
while
the
other
thing
be
toss
impatiently
out
upon
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
the
copy
of
Bamford
's
line
be
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
perhaps
he
may
have
give
it
away
;
but
then
must
it
not
have
be
to
Jem
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
his
gun
.
  
<EOS>
and
she
set
to
with
redouble
vigour
to
examine
the
deal
box
which
serve
as
chair
,
and
which
have
once
contain
her
father
's
Sunday
clothe
,
in
the
day
when
he
could
afford
to
have
Sunday
clothe
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
redeem
his
well
coat
from
the
pawn
-
shop
before
he
leave
,
that
she
have
notice
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
his
old
one
.
 
<EOS>
what
rustle
under
her
hand
in
the
pocket
?
  
<EOS>
the
paper
!
 
<EOS>
"
O
father
!
"
  
<EOS>
yes
,
it
fit
;
<EOS>
jagged
end
to
jagged
end
,
letter
to
letter
,
and
even
the
part
which
Esther
have
consider
blank
<EOS>
have
its
tally
mark
with
the
large
piece
,
its
tail
of
ys
and
gs
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
as
if
that
be
not
damn
evidence
enough
,
she
feel
again
,
and
find
some
little
bullet
or
shoot
(
I
do
not
know
which
you
would
call
them
)
in
that
same
pocket
,
along
with
a
small
paper
parcel
of
gunpowder
.
 
<EOS>
as
she
be
go
to
replace
the
jacket
,
have
abstract
the
paper
,
and
bullet
,
etc
.
,
she
see
a
woollen
gun
-
case
make
of
that
sort
of
striped
horse
-
cloth
<EOS>
you
must
have
see
a
thousand
time
appropriate
to
such
a
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
the
sight
of
it
make
her
examine
still
further
,
but
there
be
nothing
else
that
could
afford
any
evidence
,
so
she
lock
the
box
,
and
sit
down
on
the
floor
to
contemplate
the
article
;
now
with
a
sickening
despair
,
now
with
a
kind
of
wonder
curiosity
,
how
her
father
have
manage
to
evade
observation
.
 
<EOS>
after
all
it
be
easy
enough
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
evidently
get
possession
of
some
gun
<EOS>
(
be
it
really
<EOS>
Jem
's
?
<EOS>
be
he
an
accomplice
?
 
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
she
do
not
believe
it
;
he
never
,
never
would
deliberately
plan
a
murder
with
another
,
however
he
may
be
work
up
to
it
by
passionate
feeling
at
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
Least
of
all
would
he
accuse
her
to
her
father
,
without
previously
warn
her
;
it
be
out
of
his
nature
)
.
  
<EOS>
then
have
obtain
possession
of
the
gun
,
her
father
have
load
it
at
home
,
and
may
have
carry
it
away
with
him
some
time
when
the
neighbour
be
not
notice
,
and
she
be
out
,
or
asleep
;
and
then
he
may
have
hide
it
somewhere
to
be
in
readiness
when
he
should
want
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
sure
he
have
no
such
thing
with
him
when
he
go
away
the
last
time
.
  
<EOS>
She
feel
it
be
of
no
use
to
conjecture
his
motive
.
 
<EOS>
His
action
have
become
so
wild
and
irregular
of
late
,
that
she
could
not
reason
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
be
it
not
enough
to
know
that
he
be
guilty
of
this
terrible
offence
?
 
<EOS>
Her
love
for
her
father
seem
to
return
with
painful
force
,
mix
up
as
it
be
with
horror
at
his
crime
.
<EOS>
that
dear
father
who
be
once
so
kind
,
so
warm
-
hearted
,
so
ready
to
help
either
man
or
beast
in
distress
,
to
murder
!
 
<EOS>
but
in
the
desert
of
misery
with
which
these
thought
surround
her
,
the
arid
depth
of
whose
gloom
she
dare
not
venture
to
contemplate
,
a
little
spring
of
comfort
be
gush
up
at
her
foot
,
unnoticed
at
first
,
but
soon
to
give
her
strength
and
hope
.
  
<EOS>
and
that
be
the
necessity
for
exertion
on
her
part
which
this
discovery
enforce
.
  
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
do
think
that
the
necessity
for
exertion
,
for
some
kind
of
action
(
bodily
or
mental
)
in
time
of
distress
,
be
a
most
infinite
blessing
,
although
the
first
effort
at
such
season
be
painful
.
<EOS>
something
to
be
do
imply
that
there
be
yet
hope
of
some
good
thing
to
be
accomplish
,
or
some
additional
evil
that
may
be
avoid
;
and
by
degree
the
hope
absorb
much
of
the
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
woe
that
can
not
in
any
earthly
way
be
escape
that
admit
least
earthly
comforting
.
 
<EOS>
of
all
trite
,
wear
-
out
,
hollow
mockery
of
comfort
that
be
ever
utter
by
people
who
will
not
take
the
trouble
of
sympathise
with
other
,
<EOS>
the
one
I
dislike
the
most
be
the
exhortation
not
to
grieve
over
an
event
,
"
for
it
can
not
be
help
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
if
I
could
help
it
,
I
would
sit
still
with
folded
hand
,
content
to
mourn
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
not
believe
that
as
long
as
hope
remain
I
would
be
up
and
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
mourn
because
what
have
occur
can
not
be
help
.
 
<EOS>
the
reason
you
give
me
for
not
grieve
,
be
the
very
sole
reason
of
my
grief
.
 
<EOS>
give
me
noble
and
high
reason
for
endure
meekly
what
my
Father
see
fit
to
send
,
and
I
will
try
earnestly
and
faithfully
to
be
patient
;
but
mock
me
not
,
or
any
other
mourner
,
with
the
speech
,
"
do
not
grieve
,
for
it
can
not
be
help
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
past
remedy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
some
remedy
to
Mary
's
sorrow
come
with
thinking
.
 
<EOS>
if
her
father
be
guilty
,
Jem
be
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
if
innocent
,
there
be
a
possibility
of
save
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
be
save
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
must
do
it
;
for
,
be
not
she
the
sole
depository
of
the
terrible
secret
?
 
<EOS>
Her
father
be
not
suspect
;
and
never
should
be
,
if
by
any
foresight
or
any
exertion
of
her
own
she
could
prevent
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
know
how
Jem
be
to
be
save
,
while
her
father
be
also
to
be
consider
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
require
much
thought
and
much
prudence
.
 
<EOS>
but
with
the
call
upon
her
exertion
,
and
her
various
quality
of
judgment
and
discretion
,
come
the
answer
consciousness
of
innate
power
to
meet
the
emergency
.
 
<EOS>
every
step
now
,
nay
,
the
employment
of
every
minute
be
of
consequence
;
for
you
must
remember
she
have
learn
at
Miss
Simmonds
'
the
probability
that
the
murderer
would
be
bring
to
trial
the
next
week
.
 
<EOS>
and
you
must
remember
,
too
,
that
never
be
so
young
a
girl
so
friendless
,
or
so
penniless
,
as
Mary
be
at
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
lion
accompany
Una
through
the
wilderness
and
the
danger
;
and
so
will
a
high
,
resolve
purpose
of
right
-
do
ever
guard
and
accompany
the
helpless
.
  
<EOS>
It
strike
two
;
deep
,
mirk
night
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
of
no
use
bewilder
herself
with
plan
this
weary
,
endless
night
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
could
be
do
before
morning
;
and
,
at
first
in
her
impatience
,
she
begin
to
long
for
day
;
but
then
she
feel
in
how
unfit
a
state
her
body
be
for
any
plan
of
exertion
,
and
she
resolutely
make
up
her
mind
to
husband
her
physical
strength
.
  
<EOS>
first
of
all
she
must
burn
the
tell
-
tale
paper
.
 
<EOS>
the
powder
,
bullet
,
and
gun
-
case
,
she
tie
into
a
bundle
,
and
hide
in
the
sacking
of
the
bed
for
the
present
,
although
there
be
no
likelihood
of
their
affording
evidence
against
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
carry
the
paper
downstairs
,
and
burn
it
on
the
hearth
,
powder
the
very
ashe
with
her
finger
,
and
disperse
the
fragment
of
flutter
black
film
among
the
cinder
of
the
grate
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
breathe
again
.
  
<EOS>
Her
head
ache
with
dizzying
violence
;
she
must
get
quit
of
the
pain
or
it
would
incapacitate
her
for
thinking
and
planning
.
 
<EOS>
She
look
for
food
,
but
there
be
nothing
but
a
little
raw
oatmeal
in
the
house
:
<EOS>
still
,
although
it
almost
choke
her
,
she
eat
some
of
this
,
know
from
experience
,
how
often
headache
be
cause
by
long
fasting
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
seek
for
some
water
to
bathe
her
throb
temple
,
and
quench
her
feverish
thirst
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
none
in
the
house
,
so
she
take
the
jug
and
go
out
to
the
pump
at
the
other
end
of
the
court
,
whose
echo
resound
her
light
footstep
in
the
quiet
stillness
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
the
hard
,
square
outline
of
the
house
cut
sharply
against
the
cold
bright
sky
,
from
which
myriad
of
star
be
shine
down
in
eternal
repose
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
little
sympathy
in
the
outward
scene
,
with
the
internal
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
all
be
so
still
,
so
motionless
,
so
hard
!
 
<EOS>
very
different
to
this
lovely
night
in
the
country
in
which
I
be
now
write
,
where
the
distant
horizon
be
soft
and
undulate
in
the
moonlight
,
and
the
nearer
tree
sway
gently
to
and
fro
in
the
night
-
wind
with
something
of
almost
human
motion
;
and
the
rustle
air
make
music
among
their
branch
,
as
if
speak
soothingly
to
the
weary
one
who
lie
awake
in
heaviness
of
heart
.
 
<EOS>
the
sight
and
sound
of
such
a
night
lull
pain
and
grief
to
rest
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mary
re
-
enter
her
home
after
she
have
fill
her
pitcher
,
with
a
still
strong
sense
of
anxiety
,
and
a
still
clear
conviction
of
how
much
rest
upon
her
unassisted
and
friendless
self
,
alone
with
her
terrible
knowledge
,
in
the
hard
,
cold
,
populous
world
.
  
<EOS>
She
bathe
her
forehead
,
and
quench
her
thirst
,
and
then
,
with
wise
deliberation
of
purpose
,
go
upstairs
,
and
undress
herself
,
as
if
for
a
long
night
's
slumber
,
although
so
few
hour
intervene
before
day
-
dawn
.
 
<EOS>
She
believe
she
never
could
sleep
,
but
she
lie
down
,
and
shut
her
eye
;
and
before
many
minute
she
be
in
as
deep
and
sound
a
slumber
as
if
there
be
no
sin
or
sorrow
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
She
wake
up
,
as
it
be
natural
,
much
refresh
in
body
;
but
with
a
consciousness
of
some
great
impending
calamity
.
 
<EOS>
She
sit
up
in
bed
to
recollect
,
and
when
she
do
remember
,
she
sink
down
again
with
all
the
helplessness
of
despair
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
only
the
weakness
of
an
instant
;
for
be
not
the
very
minute
precious
,
for
deliberation
if
not
for
action
?
  
<EOS>
before
she
have
finish
the
necessary
morning
business
of
dressing
,
and
set
her
house
in
some
kind
of
order
,
she
have
disentangle
her
ravel
idea
,
and
arrange
some
kind
of
a
plan
for
action
.
 
<EOS>
if
Jem
be
innocent
(
and
now
of
his
guilt
,
even
his
slight
participation
in
,
or
knowledge
of
,
the
murder
,
she
acquit
him
with
all
her
heart
and
soul
)
,
he
must
have
be
somewhere
else
when
the
crime
be
commit
;
probably
with
some
other
,
who
may
bear
witness
to
the
fact
,
if
she
only
know
where
to
find
them
.
<EOS>
everything
rest
on
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
hear
of
an
alibi
,
and
believe
it
may
mean
the
deliverance
she
wish
to
accomplish
;
but
she
be
not
quite
sure
,
and
determine
to
apply
to
Job
,
as
one
of
the
few
among
her
acquaintance
gift
with
the
knowledge
of
hard
word
,
for
to
her
,
all
term
of
law
,
or
natural
history
,
be
alike
many
-
syllable
mystery
.
  
<EOS>
no
time
be
to
be
lose
.
 
<EOS>
She
go
straight
to
<EOS>
Job
Legh
's
house
,
and
find
the
old
man
and
his
grand
-
daughter
sit
at
breakfast
;
as
she
open
the
door
she
hear
their
voice
speak
in
a
grave
,
hush
,
subdued
tone
,
as
if
something
grieve
their
heart
.
 
<EOS>
They
stop
talk
on
her
entrance
,
and
then
she
know
they
have
be
converse
about
the
murder
;
about
Jem
's
probable
guilt
;
and
(
it
flash
upon
her
for
the
first
time
)
on
the
new
light
they
would
have
obtain
regard
herself
:
<EOS>
for
until
now
they
have
never
hear
of
her
giddy
flirting
with
Mr.
Carson
;
not
in
all
her
confidential
talk
with
Margaret
have
she
ever
speak
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
,
Margaret
would
hear
her
conduct
talk
of
by
all
,
as
that
of
a
bold
,
bad
girl
;
and
even
if
she
do
not
believe
everything
that
be
say
,
she
could
hardly
help
feel
wound
,
and
disappoint
in
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
so
it
be
in
a
timid
voice
that
Mary
wish
her
usual
good
-
morrow
,
and
her
heart
sink
within
her
a
little
,
when
Job
,
with
a
form
of
civility
,
bade
her
welcome
in
that
dwelling
,
where
,
until
now
,
she
have
be
too
well
assured
to
require
to
be
ask
to
sit
down
.
  
<EOS>
She
take
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
Margaret
continue
silent
.

"

"
I
be

enough

<EOS>
reply
Job
<EOS>
;

I

Job
relapse
into

Mary

a
moment

well

answer
Mary
,
in
agony
of
terror
,
lest
Job
's
question
be
prompt
by
any
suspicion
of
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
be
far
enough
from
any
such
thought
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
have
no
doubt
in
his
own
mind
that
Jem
have
,
in
some
passionate
moment
,
urge
on
by
slight
love
and
jealousy
,
be
the
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
strongly
inclined
to
believe
,
that
Mary
be
aware
of
this
,
only
that
,
too
late
repentant
of
her
light
conduct
which
have
lead
to
such
fatal
consequence

she
be
now
most
anxious
to
save
her
old
playfellow

her
early

from
the
doom
await
the
shedder
of

"
if

I

We

they

I

,
o

<EOS>
be
not
an

a
proving

I

"
  
<EOS>
"
an
alibi
be
that
,
sure
enough
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
think
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
mun
ask
his
mother
his
doing
,
and
his
whereabout
that
night
;
the
knowledge
of
that
will
guide
you
a
bit
.
"
  
<EOS>
for
he
be
anxious
that
on
another
should
fall
the
task
of
enlighten
Mary
on
the
hopelessness
of
the
case
,
and
he
feel
that
her
own
sense
would
be
more
convinced
by
inquiry
and
examination
than
any
mere
assertion
of
his
.
  
<EOS>
Margaret
have
sit
silent
and
grave
all
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
to
tell
the
truth
,
she
be
surprised
and
disappoint
by
the
disclosure
of
Mary
's
conduct
,
with
regard
to
Mr.
Henry
Carson
.
 
<EOS>
Gentle
,
reserve
,
and
prudent
herself
,
never
expose
to
the
trial
of
be
admire
for
her
personal
appearance
,
and
unsusceptible
enough
to
be
in
doubt
even
yet
,
whether
the
flutter
,
tender
,
infinitely
joyous
feeling
she
be
for
the
first
time
experience
,
at
sight
or
sound
,
or
thought
of
Will
Wilson
,
be
love
or
not
,
 
Margaret
have
no
sympathy
with
the
temptation
to
which
loveliness
,
vanity
,
ambition
,
or
the
desire
of
be
admire
,
expose
so
many
;
no
sympathy
with
flirt
girl
,
in
short
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
she
have
no
idea
of
the
strength
of
the
conflict
between
will
and
principle
in
some
who
be
differently
constitute
from
herself
.
 
<EOS>
with
her
,
to
be
convince
that
an
action
be
wrong
,
be
tantamount
to
a
determination
not
to
do
so
again
;
and
she
have
little
or
no
difficulty
in
carry
out
her
determination
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
could
not
understand
how
it
be
that
Mary
have
act
wrongly
,
and
have
feel
too
much
ashamed
,
in
spite
of
internal
sophistry
,
to
speak
of
her
action
.
 
<EOS>
Margaret
consider
herself
deceive
;
feel
aggrieved
;
and
,
at
the
time
of
which
I
be
now
tell
you
,
be
strongly
inclined
to
give
Mary
up
altogether
,
as
a
girl
devoid
of
the
modest
propriety
of
her
sex
,
and
capable
of
gross
duplicity
,
in
speak
of
one
lover
as
she
have
do
of
Jem
,
while
she
be
encourage
another
in
attention
,
at
good
of
a
very
doubtful
character
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
Margaret
be
draw
into
the
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
it
flash
across
Mary
's
mind
,
that
the
night
of
the
murder
be
the
very
night
,
or
rather
the
same
early
morning
,
that
Margaret
have
be
with
Alice
.
 
<EOS>
She
turn
sharp
round
,
with
   
"
<EOS>
O
Margaret
,
you
can
tell
me
;
you
be
there
when
he
come
back
that
night
;
be
you
not
?
 
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
you
be
not
;
but
you
be
there
not
many
hour
after
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
hear
where
he
would
be
?
 
<EOS>
He
be
away
the
night
before
,
too
,
when
Alice
be
first
take
;
when
you
be
there
for
your
tea

oh

<EOS>
where
be
he
,
Margaret
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
she
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
stay
!
<EOS>
I
do
remember
something
about
his
keeping
Will
company
,
in
his
walk
to
Liverpool
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
justly
say
what
it
be
,
so
much
happen
that
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
to
his
mother
's
,
"
say
Mary
resolutely
.
  
<EOS>
They
neither
of
them
speak
,
either
to
advise
or
dissuade
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
feel
she
have
no
sympathy
from
them
,
and
brace
up
her
soul
to
act
without
such
loving
aid
of
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
She
know
that
their
advice
would
be
willingly
give
at
her
demand
,
and
that
be
all
she
really
require
for
Jem
's
sake
.
 
<EOS>
still
her
courage
fail
a
little
as
she
walk
to
Jane
Wilson
's
,
alone
in
the
world
with
her
secret
.
  
<EOS>
Jane
Wilson
's
eye
be
swell
with
crying
;
and
it
be
sad
to
see
the
ravage
which
intense
anxiety
and
sorrow
have
make
on
her
appearance
in
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
.
 
<EOS>
all
night
long
she
and
Mrs.
Davenport
have
croon
over
their
sorrow
,
always
recur
,
like
the
burden
of
an
old
song
,
to
the
dreadest
sorrow
of
all
,
which
be
now
impend
over
Mrs.
Wilson
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
grow
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
what
word
to
use
 
<EOS>
but
,
something
like
proud
of
her
martyrdom
;
she
have
grow
to
hug
her
grief
;
to
feel
an
excitement
in
her
agony
of
anxiety
about
her
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
so
,
Mary
,
you
be
here
!
 
<EOS>
o
Mary
,
lass
!
 
<EOS>
He
be
to
be
try
on
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
fall
to
sob
,
in
the
convulsive
breath
-
catch
manner
which
tell
of
so
much
previous
weeping
.
  
<EOS>
"
o
Mrs.
Wilson
,
do
not
take
on
so
!
 
<EOS>
We
will
get
him
off
,
you
will
see
.
<EOS>
do
not
fret
;
they
can
not
prove
him
guilty
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
I
tell
thee
they
will
,
"
interrupt
Mrs.
Wilson
,
half
-
irritated
at
the
light
way
,
as
she
consider
it
,
in
which
Mary
speak
;
and
a
little
displeased
that
another
could
hope
when
she
have
almost
bring
herself
to
find
pleasure
in
despair
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
suit
thee
well
,
"
continue
she
,
"
to
make
light
o
'
the
misery
thou
hast
cause
;
but
I
shall
lay
his
death
at
thy
door
,
as
long
as
I
live
,
and
die
<EOS>
I
know
he
will
;
and
all
for
what
he
never
do
 
<EOS>
no
,
he
never
do
;
my
own
blessed
boy
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
too
weak
to
be
angry
long
;
her
wrath
sink
away
to
feeble
sobbing
and
wear
-
out
moan
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
be
most
anxious
to
soothe
her
from
any
violence
of
either
grief
or
anger
;
she
do
so
want
her
to
be
clear
in
her
recollection
;
and
,
besides
,
her
tenderness
be
great
towards
Jem
's
mother
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
speak
in
a
low
gentle
tone
the
love
sentence
,
which
sound
so
broken
and
powerless
in
repetition
,
and
which
yet
have
so
much
power
when
accompany
with
caress
look
and
action
,
fresh
from
the
heart
;
and
the
old
woman
insensibly
give
herself
up
to
the
influence
of
those
sweet
,
love
blue
eye
,
those
tear
of
sympathy
,
those
word
of
love
and
hope
,
and
be
lull
into
a
less
morbid
state
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
dear
Mrs.
Wilson
,
can
you
remember
where
he
say
he
be
go
on
Thursday
night
?
 
<EOS>
He
be
out
when
Alice
be
take
ill
;
and
he
do
not
come
home
till
early
in
the
morning
,
or
,
to
speak
true
,
in
the
night
:
do
he
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
!
<EOS>
he
go
out
near
upon
five
;
he
go
out
with
Will
;
he
say
he
be
go
to
set
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
him
a
part
of
the
way
,
for
Will
be
hot
upon
walk
to
Liverpool
,
and
would
not
hearken
to
Jem
's
offer
of
lend
him
five
shilling
for
his
fare
.
 
<EOS>
so
the
two
lad
set
off
together
.
<EOS>
I
mind
it
all
now
:
but
,
thou
seest
,
Alice
's
illness
,
and
this
business
of
poor
Jem

,
drive
it
out
of
my
head

they
go
off
together
,
to
walk
to
Liverpool

;
that
be
to
say
,
Jem
be
to
go
a
part
o
<EOS>

th

way

<EOS>
but
,
who
know
"
(
fall
back
into
the
old
desponding
tone
)
<EOS>
"
if
he
really
go
?
 
<EOS>
He
may
be
lead
off
on
the
road

<EOS>
o
Mary

wench
!

they
will
hang
him
for
what
he

never

"
     
<EOS>
"
no
they
will
not
,
they
shall
not

<EOS>
I
see
my
way
a
bit
now
.
 
<EOS>
We
mun
get
Will
to
help
;
there
will
be
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
swear
that
Jem
be
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
where
be
Jem
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
folk
say
he
be
take
to
Kirkdale
,
i

th

prison
van
this
morning
,
without
my
see
him
,
poor
chap

<EOS>
o
wench
!
<EOS>
but
they
have
hurry
on
the
business
at
a
cruel
rate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ay
!
<EOS>
they
have
not
let
grass
grow
under
their
foot

in
hunt
out
the
man
that
do
it
,
"
say
Mary
sorrowfully
and
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
keep
up
your
heart
.
 
<EOS>
They
get
on
the
wrong
scent
when
they
take
to
suspect
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
be
afeard
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
see
it
will
end
right
for
Jem

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
mind
it
less
if
I
could
do
aught
,
"
say
Jane
Wilson
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
be
such
a
poor
weak
old
body
,
and
my
head
be
so
go
,
and
I
be
so
dazed
<EOS>
like
,
what
with
Alice
and
all
,
that
I
think
and
think
,
and
can
do
nought
to
help
my
child

<EOS>
I
may
ha

go
and
see
him
last
night
,
they
tell
me
now
,
and
then
I
miss
it
.
 
<EOS>
o
Mary
,
I
miss
it
;
and
I
may
never
see
the
lad
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
look
so
piteously
in
Mary
's
face
with
her
miserable
eye
,
that
Mary
feel
her
heart
give
way
,
and
,
dread
the
weakness
of
her
power
,
which
the
burst
of
cry
she
long
for
<EOS>
would
occasion
,
hastily
change
the
subject
to
Alice
;
and
Jane
<EOS>
,
in
her
heart
,
feel
that
there
be
no
sorrow
like
a
mother
's
sorrow
,
reply
   
"
<EOS>
She
keep
on
much
the
same
,
thank
you

<EOS>
She
be
happy
,
for
she
know
nothing
of
what
be
go
on
;
but
th
'
doctor
say
she
grow
weak
and
weak
.
 
<EOS>
Thou'lt
maybe
like
to
see
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
go
upstairs
;
partly
because
it
be
the
etiquette
in
humble
life
to
offer
to
friend
a
last
opportunity
of
see
the
dying
or
the
dead
,
while
the
same
etiquette
forbid
a
refusal
of
the
invitation
;
and
partly
because
she
long
to
breathe
,
for
an
instant
,
the
atmosphere
of
holy
calm
,
which
seem
ever
to
surround
the
pious
,
good
old
woman
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
lie
,
as
before
,
without
pain
,
or
at
least
any
outward
expression
of
it
;
but
totally
unconscious
of
all
present
circumstance
,
and
absorb
in
recollection
of
the
day
of
her
girlhood
,
which
be
vivid
enough
to
take
the
place
of
reality
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
still
she
talk
of
green
field
,
and
still
she
speak
to
the
long
-
dead
mother
and
sister
,
low
-
lying
in
their
grave
this
many
a
year
,
as
if
they
be
with
her
and
about
her
,
in
the
pleasant
place
where
her
youth
have
pass
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
voice
be
fainter
,
the
motion
be
more
languid
;
she
be
evidently
pass
away
;
but
how
happily
!
  
<EOS>
Mary
stand
for
a
time
in
silence
,
watching
and
listening
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
bend
down
and
reverently
kiss
Alice
's
cheek
;
and
draw
Jane
Wilson
away
from
the
bed
,
as
if
the
spirit
of
her
who
lie
there
be
yet
cognisant
of
present
reality
,
she
whisper
a
few
word
of
hope
to
the
poor
mother
,
and
kiss
her
over
and
over
again
in
a
warm
,
love
manner
,
she
bid
her
good
-
bye
,
go
a
few
step
,
and
then
once
more
come
back
to
bid
her
keep
up
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
and
when
she
have
fairly
leave
the
house
,
Jane
Wilson
feel
as
if
a
sunbeam
have
cease
shine
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
yet
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
sorely
Mary
's
heart
ache
;
for
more
and
more
the
fell
certainty
come
on
her
that
her
father
be
the
murderer
!
 
<EOS>
She
struggle
hard
not
to
dwell
on
this
conviction
;
to
think
alone
on
the
mean
of
prove
Jem
's
innocence
;
that
be
her
first
duty
,
and
that
should
be
do
.
   
<EOS>
the
SUB
-
POENA
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
must
it
then
depend
on
this
poor
eye
<EOS>
and
this
unsteady
hand
,
whether
the
bark
,
that
bear
my
all
of
treasured
hope
and
love
,
Shall
find
a
passage
through
these
frown
rock
to
some
fair
port
where
peace
and
safety
smile
,
 
or
whether
it
shall
blindly
dash
against
them
,
and
miserably
sink
?
<EOS>
Heaven
be
my
help
;
and
clear
my
eye
and
nerve
my
tremble
hand
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
constant
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
heart
beat
,
her
head
full
of
idea
,
which
require
time
and
solitude
to
be
reduce
into
order
,
Mary
hurry
home
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
like
one
who
find
a
jewel
of
which
he
can
not
all
at
once
ascertain
the
value
,
but
who
hide
his
treasure
until
some
quiet
hour
when
he
may
ponder
over
the
capability
its
possession
unfold
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
like
one
who
discover
the
silken
clue
which
guide
to
some
bower
of
bliss
,
and
secure
of
the
power
within
his
grasp
,
have
to
wait
for
a
time
before
he
may
thread
the
labyrinth
.
  
<EOS>
but
no
jewel
,
no
bower
of
bliss
be
ever
so
precious
to
miser
or
lover
as
be
the
belief
which
now
pervade
Mary
's
mind
that
Jem
's
innocence
may
be
prove
,
without
involve
any
suspicion
of
that
other
 
<EOS>
that
dear
one
,
so
dear
,
although
so
criminal
 
on
whose
part
in
this
cruel
business
she
dare
not
dwell
even
in
thought
.
 
<EOS>
for
if
she
do
there
arise
the
awful
question
,
 
if
all
go
against
Jem
<EOS>
the
innocent
,
if
judge
and
jury
give
the
verdict
forth
which
have
the
loom
gallow
in
the
rear
,
what
ought
she
to
do
,
possess
of
her
terrible
knowledge
?
 
<EOS>
surely
not
to
inculpate
her
father
 
and
<EOS>
yet
 
<EOS>
and
yet
 
she
almost
pray
for
the
blessed
unconsciousness
of
death
or
madness
,
rather
than
that
awful
question
should
have
to
be
answer
by
her
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
a
way
seem
opening
,
open
yet
more
clear
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
thankful
she
have
think
of
the
alibi
,
and
yet
more
thankful
to
have
so
easily
obtain
the
clue
to
Jem
's
whereabout
that
miserable
night
.
 
<EOS>
the
bright
light
that
her
new
hope
throw
over
all
seem
also
to
make
her
thankful
for
the
early
time
appoint
for
the
trial
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
easy
to
catch
Will
Wilson
on
his
return
from
the
Isle
of
Man
,
which
he
have
plan
<EOS>
should
be
on
the
Monday
;
and
on
the
Tuesday
all
would
be
make
clear
 
all
that
she
dare
to
wish
to
be
make
clear
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
still
to
collect
her
thought
and
freshen
her
memory
enough
to
arrange
how
to
meet
with
Will
 
for
to
the
chance
of
a
letter
she
would
not
trust
;
to
find
out
his
lodging
when
in
Liverpool
;
to
try
and
remember
the
name
of
the
ship
in
which
he
be
to
sail
:
and
the
more
she
consider
these
point
,
the
more
difficulty
she
find
there
would
be
in
ascertain
these
minor
but
important
fact
.
 
<EOS>
for
you
be
aware
that
Alice
,
whose
memory
be
clear
and
strong
on
all
point
in
which
her
heart
be
interested
,
be
lie
in
a
manner
senseless
:
<EOS>
that
Jane
Wilson
be
(
to
use
her
own
word
,
so
expressive
to
a
Lancashire
ear
)
"
daze
"
;
that
be
to
say
,
bewilder
,
lose
in
the
confusion
of
terrifying
and
distress
thought
;
incapable
of
concentrate
her
mind
;
and
at
the
good
of
time
Will
's
proceeding
be
a
matter
of
little
importance
to
her
(
or
so
she
pretend
)
,
she
be
so
jealous
of
aught
which
distract
attention
from
her
pearl
of
price
,
her
only
son
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
so
Mary
feel
hopeless
of
obtain
any
intelligence
of
the
sailor
's
arrangement
from
her
.
  
<EOS>
then
,
should
she
apply
to
Jem
himself
?
 
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
she
know
him
too
well
.
<EOS>
She
feel
how
thoroughly
he
must
ere
now
have
have
it
in
his
power
to
exculpate
himself
at
another
's
expense
.
 
<EOS>
and
his
tacit
refusal
so
to
do
,
have
assure
her
of
what
she
have
never
doubt
,
that
the
murderer
be
safe
from
any
impeachment
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
but
then
neither
would
he
consent
,
she
fear
,
to
any
step
which
may
tend
to
prove
himself
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
she
could
not
consult
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
remove
to
Kirkdale
,
and
time
press
.
 
<EOS>
already
it
be
Saturday
at
noon
.
<EOS>
and
even
if
she
could
have
go
to
him
,
I
believe
she
would
not
.
<EOS>
She
long
to
do
all
herself
;
to
be
his
liberator
,
his
deliverer
;
to
win
him
life
,
though
she
may
never
regain
his
lost
love
by
her
own
exertion
!
 
<EOS>
and
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
how
could
she
see
him
to
discuss
a
subject
in
which
both
know
who
be
the
bloodstained
man
;
and

She

<EOS>
Her

look
at
the
unusual
appearance
of
the
writing

which
,
though
legible

convey
no

rather
her

shut
itself
up

any

which
after
all
be
rather
a
proof
she
have
some
suspicion

<EOS>
"
what

ask

ask
Mary
again
,
in

hoarse

feeble

over
in
her

<EOS>
"

Mary

She

She

so
certain

monosyllable

off

reason

oh

awful
be
it
in

<EOS>
a
NONYMOUS
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
could
not
be
patient
in
her
loneliness
;
so
much
painful
thought
weigh
on
her
mind
;
the
very
house
be
haunt
with
memory
and
foreshadowing
.
  
<EOS>
have
perform
all
duty
to
Jem
,
as
far
as
her
weak
power
,
yet
love
heart
could
act
;
and
a
black
veil
be
draw
over
her
father
's
past
,
present
,
and
future
life
,
beyond
which
she
could
not
penetrate
to
judge
of
any
filial
service
she
ought
to
render
:
her
mind
unconsciously
seek
after
some
course
of
action
in
which
she
may
engage
.
 
<EOS>
anything
,
anything
,
rather
than
leisure
for
reflection
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
come
up
the
old
feeling
which
first
bind
Ruth
to
Naomi
<EOS>
;
the
love
they
both
hold
towards
one
object
;
and
Mary
feel
that
her
care
would
be
most
lighten
by
be
of
use
,
or
of
comfort
to
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
once
more
lock
up
the
house
,
and
set
off
towards
ancoat
;
rush
along
with
downcast
head
,
for
fear
lest
anyone
should
recognise
her
and
arrest
her
progress
.
  
<EOS>
Jane
Wilson
sit
quietly
in
her
chair
as
Mary
enter
;
so
quietly
,
as
to
strike
one
by
the
contrast
it
present
to
her
usual
bustling
and
nervous
manner
.
  
<EOS>
She
look
very
pale
and
wan
:
but
the
quietness
be
the
thing
that
strike
Mary
most
.
 
<EOS>
She
do
not
rise
as
Mary
come
in
,
but
sit
still
and
say
something
in
so
gentle
,
so
feeble
a
voice
,
that
Mary
do
not
catch
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davenport
,
who
be
there
,
pluck
Mary
by
the
gown
,
and
whisper
,
"
never
heed
her
;
she
be
wear
out
,
and
best
let
alone
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
all
about
it
,
upstairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
Mary
,
touch
by
the
anxious
look
with
which
Mrs.
Wilson
gaze
at
her
,
as
if
wait
the
answer
to
some
question
,
go
forward
to
listen
to
the
speech
she
be
again
repeat
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
this
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
tell
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
then
Mary
look
and
see
another
ominous
slip
of
parchment
in
the
mother
's
hand
,
which
she
be
roll
up
and
down
in
a
tremulous
manner
between
her
finger
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
's
heart
sicken
within
her
,
and
she
could
not
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
?
"
<EOS>
she
repeat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
tell
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
still
look
at
Mary
,
with
the
same
child
-
like
gaze
of
wonder
and
patient
entreaty
.
  
<EOS>
what
could
she
answer
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
ye
not
to
heed
her
,
"
say
Mrs.
Davenport
,
a
little
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
know
well
enough
what
it
be
 
too
well
,
<EOS>
belike
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
in
when
they
sarve
it
;
but
Mrs.
Heming
(
her
as
live
next
door
)
be
,
and
she
spell
out
the
meaning
,
and
make
it
all
clear
to
Mrs.
Wilson
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
summon
to
be
a
witness
on
Jem
's
trial
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Heming
think
to
swear
to
the
gun
;
for
yo
see
,
there
be
nobbut
<EOS>
*
<EOS>
her
as
can
testify
to
its
be
his

and
she
let
on
so
easily
to
the
policeman
that
it
be
his
,
that
there
be
no
get
off
her
word
now
.
<EOS>
poor
body
;
she
take
it
very
hard
,
I
dare
say
!
"
     
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilson
have
wait
patiently
while
this
whisper
speech
be
be
utter
,
imagine
,
perhaps
,
that
it
would
end
in
some
explanation
address
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
both
be
silent
,
though
their
eye
,
without
speech
or
language
,
tell
their
heart
'
pity
,
she
speak
again
in
the
same
unaltered
gentle
voice
(
so
different
from
the
irritable
impatience
she
have
be
ever
apt
to
show
to
everyone
except
her
husband
 
<EOS>
he
who
have
wed
her
,
break
-
down
and
injure
)
,
 
in
a
voice
so
different
,
I
say
,
from
the
old
,
hasty
manner
<EOS>
,
she
speak
now
the
same
anxious
word
   
<EOS>
"
what
be
this
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
tell
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yo'd
better
give
it
me
at
once
,
Mrs.
Wilson
,
and
let
me
put
it
out
of
your
sight
.
 
<EOS>
speak
to
her
,
Mary
,
wench
,
and
ask
for
a
sight
on
it
<EOS>
;
I
have
try
and
better
-
try
to
get
it
from
her
,
and
she
take
no
heed
of
word
,
and
I
be
loth
to
pull
it
by
force
out
of
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
draw
the
little
"
cricket
"
*
out
from
under
the
dresser
,
and
sit
down
at
Mrs.
Wilson
's
knee
,
and
,
coax
one
of
her
tremulous
ever
-
move
hand
into
her
,
begin
to
rub
it
soothingly
;
there
be
a
little
resistance
 
a
very
little
,
but
that
be
all
;
and
presently
,
in
the
nervous
movement
of
the
imprison
hand
,
the
parchment
fall
to
the
ground
.
     
<EOS>
Mary
calmly
and
openly
pick
it
up
,
without
any
attempt
at
concealment
,
and
quietly
place
it
in
sight
of
the
anxious
eye
that
follow
it
with
a
kind
of
spell
-
bind
dread
,
go
on
with
her
soothe
caress
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
have
have
no
sleep
for
many
night
,
"
say
the
girl
to
Mrs.
Davenport
,
"
and
all
this
woe
and
sorrow
,
 
<EOS>
it
be
no
wonder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davenport
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
get
her
fairly
to
bed
;
we
must
get
her
undressed
,
and
all
;
and
trust
to
God
in
His
mercy
to
send
her
to
sleep
,
or
else
<EOS>
"
    
for
,
you
see
,
they
speak
before
her
as
if
she
be
not
there
;
her
heart
be
so
far
away
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
they
almost
lift
her
from
the
chair
,
in
which
she
sit
motionless
,
and
take
her
up
as
gently
as
a
mother
carry
her
sleep
baby
,
they
undress
her
poor
,
wear
form
,
and
lay
her
in
the
little
bed
upstairs
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
once
think
of
place
her
in
Jem
's
bed
,
to
be
out
of
sight
or
sound
of
any
disturbance
of
Alice
's
;
but
then
again
they
remember
the
shock
she
may
receive
in
awaken
in
so
unusual
a
place
,
and
also
that
Mary
,
who
intend
to
keep
vigil
that
night
in
the
house
of
mourning
,
would
find
it
difficult
to
divide
her
attention
in
the
possible
case
that
may
ensue
.
  
<EOS>
so
they
lay
her
,
as
I
say
before
,
on
that
little
pallet
bed
;
and
,
as
they
be
slowly
withdraw
from
the
bedside
,
hope
and
pray
that
she
may
sleep
,
and
forget
for
a
time
her
heavy
burden
<EOS>
,
she
look
wistfully
after
Mary
,
and
whisper
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
tell
me
what
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
and
gaze
in
her
face
for
the
expect
answer
,
her
eyelid
slowly
closed
,
and
she
fall
into
a
deep
,
heavy
sleep
,
almost
as
profound
a
rest
as
death
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Davenport
go
her
way
,
and
Mary
be
alone
,
 
for
I
can
not
call
those
who
sleep
ally
against
the
agony
of
thought
which
solitude
sometimes
bring
up
.
  
<EOS>
She
dread
the
night
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
may
die
;
the
doctor
have
that
day
declare
her
case
hopeless
,
and
not
far
from
death
;
and
at
time
,
the
terror
so
natural
to
the
young
,
not
of
death
,
but
of
the
remain
of
the
dead
,
come
over
Mary
;
and
she
bend
and
listen
anxiously
for
the
long
-
draw
,
pause
breath
of
the
sleep
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
or
Mrs.
Wilson
may
awake
in
a
state
which
Mary
dread
to
anticipate
,
and
anticipate
while
she
dread
;
 
in
a
state
of
complete
delirium
.
 
<EOS>
already
her
sense
have
be
severely
stun
by
the
full
explanation
of
what
be
require
of
her
 
of
what
she
have
to
prove
against
her
son
,
her
Jem
,
her
only
child
 
<EOS>
which
Mary
could
not
doubt
the
officious
Mrs.
Heming
have
give
;
and
what
if
in
dream
(
that
land
into
which
no
sympathy
or
love
can
penetrate
with
another
,
either
to
share
its
bliss
or
its
agony
 
<EOS>
that
land
whose
scene
be
unspeakable
terror
,
be
hide
mystery
,
be
priceless
treasure
to
one
alone
 
that
land
where
alone
<EOS>
I
may
see
,
while
yet
I
tarry
here
,
the
sweet
look
of
my
dear
child
)
 
<EOS>
what
if
,
in
the
horror
of
her
dream
,
her
brain
should
go
still
more
astray
,
and
she
should
waken
crazy
with
her
vision
,
and
the
terrible
reality
that
beget
them
?
  
<EOS>
how
much
bad
be
anticipation
sometimes
than
reality
!
 
<EOS>
how
Mary
dread
that
night
,
and
how
calmly
it
pass
by
!
 
<EOS>
even
more
so
than
if
Mary
have
not
have
such
claim
upon
her
care
!
  
<EOS>
anxiety
about
them
deaden
her
own
peculiar
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
She
think
of
the
sleeper
whom
she
be
watch
,
till
,
overpower
herself
by
the
want
of
rest
<EOS>
,
she
fall
off
into
short
slumber
in
which
the
night
wear
imperceptibly
away
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
sure
,
Alice
speak
,
and
sing
during
her
wake
moment
,
like
the
child
she
deem
herself
;
but
so
happily
with
the
dearly
-
love
one
around
her
,
with
the
scent
of
the
heather
,
and
the
song
of
the
wild
bird
hover
about
her
in
imagination
 
with
old
scrap
of
ballad
,
or
old
snatch
of
primitive
version
of
the
Psalms
(
such
as
be
sing
in
country
church
half
draperie
over
with
ivy
,
and
where
the
run
brook
,
or
the
murmuring
wind
among
the
tree
make
fit
accompaniment
to
the
chorus
of
human
voice
utter
praise
and
thanksgive
to
their
God
)
 
<EOS>
that
the
speech
and
the
song
give
comfort
and
good
cheer
to
the
listener
's
heart
,
and
the
grey
dawn
begin
to
dim
the
light
of
the
rush
-
candle
,
before
Mary
think
it
possible
that
day
be
already
tremble
in
the
horizon
.
  
<EOS>
then
she
get
up
from
the
chair
where
she
have
be
doze
,
and
go
,
half
-
asleep
,
to
the
window
to
assure
herself
that
morning
be
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
street
be
unusually
quiet
with
a
Sabbath
stillness
.
<EOS>
no
factory
bell
that
morning
;
no
early
workman
go
to
their
labour
;
no
slip
-
shod
girl
clean
the
window
of
the
little
shop
which
break
the
monotony
of
the
street
;
instead
,
you
may
see
here
<EOS>
and
there
some
operative
sallye
forth
for
a
breath
of
country
air
,
or
some
father
lead
out
his
wee
toddling
bairn
for
the
unwonted
pleasure
of
a
walk
with
"
daddy
,
"
in
the
clear
frosty
morning
.
 
<EOS>
man
with
more
leisure
on
week
-
day
would
perhaps
have
walk
quicker
than
they
do
through
the
fresh
sharp
air
of
this
Sunday
morning
;
but
to
them
there
be
a
pleasure
,
an
absolute
refreshment
in
the
dawdling
gait
they
,
one
and
all
of
them
,
have
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
,
indeed
,
one
or
two
passenger
on
that
morning
whose
object
be
less
innocent
and
less
praiseworthy
than
those
of
the
people
I
have
already
mention
,
and
whose
animal
state
of
mind
and
body
clash
jarringly
on
the
peacefulness
of
the
day
,
but
upon
them
I
will
not
dwell
;
as
you
and
I
,
and
almost
every
one
,
I
think
,
may
send
up
our
individual
cry
of
self
-
reproach
that
we
have
not
do
all
that
we
could
for
the
stray
and
wander
one
of
our
brother
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mary
turn
from
the
window
,
she
go
to
the
bed
of
each
sleeper
,
to
look
and
listen
.
 
<EOS>
Alice
look
perfectly
quiet
and
happy
in
her
slumber
,
and
her
face
seem
to
have
become
much
more
youthful
during
the
painless
approach
to
death
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilson
's
countenance
be
stamp
with
the
anxiety
of
the
last
few
day
,
although
she
,
too
,
appear
sleep
soundly
;
but
as
Mary
gaze
on
her
,
try
to
trace
a
likeness
to
her
son
in
her
face
,
she
awake
and
look
up
into
Mary
's
eye
,
while
the
expression
of
consciousness
come
back
into
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
both
be
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
's
eye
have
fall
beneath
that
penetrating
gaze
,
in
which
the
agony
of
memory
seem
every
minute
to
find
full
vent
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
a
dream
?
"
<EOS>
the
mother
ask
at
last
in
a
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
!
"
reply
Mary
,
in
the
same
tone
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilson
hide
her
face
in
the
pillow
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
fully
conscious
of
everything
this
morning
;
it
be
evident
that
the
stunning
effect
of
the
sub
-
poena
,
which
have
affect
her
so
much
last
night
in
her
weak
,
wear
-
out
state
,
have
pass
away
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
offer
no
opposition
when
she
indicate
by
languid
gesture
and
action
that
she
wish
to
rise
.
 
<EOS>
a
sleepless
bed
be
a
haunted
place
.
  
<EOS>
when
she
be
dress
with
Mary
's
aid
,
she
stand
by
Alice
for
a
minute
or
two
look
at
the
slumberer
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
happy
she
be
!
"
<EOS>
say
she
,
quietly
and
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
all
the
time
that
Mary
be
get
breakfast
ready
,
and
perform
every
other
little
domestic
office
she
could
think
of
,
to
add
to
the
comfort
of
Jem
's
mother
,
Mrs.
Wilson
sit
still
in
the
arm
-
chair
,
watch
her
silently
.
 
<EOS>
Her
old
irritation
of
temper
and
manner
seem
to
have
suddenly
disappear
,
or
perhaps
she
be
too
depressed
in
body
and
mind
to
show
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
tell
her
all
that
have
be
do
with
regard
to
Mr.
Bridgnorth
;
all
her
own
plan
for
seek
out
Will
;
all
her
hope
;
and
conceal
as
well
as
she
could
all
the
doubt
and
fear
that
would
arise
unbidden
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
Mrs.
Wilson
listen
without
much
remark
,
but
with
deep
interest
and
perfect
comprehension
.
 
<EOS>
when
Mary
cease
,
she
sigh
,
and
say
,
"
o
wench
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
his
mother
,
and
yet
I
do
so
little
<EOS>
,
I
can
do
so
little
!
 
<EOS>
that
be
what
fret
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
seem
like
a
child
as
see
its
mammy
ill
,
and
moan
and
cry
its
little
heart
out
,
yet
do
nought
to
help
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
my
sense
have
leave
me
all
at
once
,
and
I
can
not
even
find
strength
to
cry
like
the
little
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hereupon
she
break
into
a
feeble
wail
of
self
-
reproach
,
that
her
outward
show
of
misery
be
not
great
;
as
if
any
cry
,
or
tear
,
or
loud
-
spoken
word
could
have
tell
of
such
pang
at
the
heart
as
that
look
,
and
that
thin
,
piping
,
altered
voice
!
  
<EOS>
but
think
of
Mary
and
what
she
be
endure
.
 
<EOS>
picture
to
yourself
<EOS>
(
for
I
can
not
tell
you
)
<EOS>
the
army
of
thought
that
meet
and
clash
in
her
brain
;
and
then
imagine
the
effort
it
cost
her
to
be
calm
,
and
quiet
,
and
even
in
a
faint
way
,
cheerful
and
smile
at
time
.
  
<EOS>
after
a
while
she
begin
to
stir
about
in
her
own
mind
for
some
mean
of
spare
the
poor
mother
<EOS>
the
trial
of
appear
as
a
witness
in
the
matter
of
the
gun
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
make
no
allusion
to
her
summon
this
morning
,
and
Mary
almost
think
she
must
have
forget
it
;
and
surely
some
mean
may
be
find
to
prevent
that
additional
sorrow
.
<EOS>
She
must
see
Job
about
it
;
nay
,
if
necessary
,
she
must
see
Mr.
Bridgnorth
,
with
all
his
truth
-
compel
power
;
for
,
indeed
,
she
have
so
struggle
and
triumph
(
though
a
sadly
-
bleed
victor
at
heart
)
over
herself
these
two
last
day
,
have
so
conceal
agony
,
and
hide
her
inward
woe
and
bewilderment
,
that
she
begin
to
take
confidence
,
and
to
have
faith
in
her
own
power
of
meet
any
one
with
a
passably
fair
show
,
whatever
may
be
rend
her
life
beneath
the
cloak
of
her
deception
.
  
<EOS>
accordingly
,
as
soon
as
Mrs.
Davenport
come
in
after
morning
church
,
to
ask
after
the
two
lone
woman
,
and
she
have
hear
the
report
Mary
have
to
give
(
so
much
well
as
regard
Mrs.
Wilson
than
what
they
have
fear
the
night
before
it
would
have
be
)
 
as
soon
as
this
kind
-
hearted
,
grateful
woman
come
in
,
Mary
,
tell
her
purpose
,
go
off
to
fetch
the
doctor
who
attend
Alice
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
shake
himself
after
his
morning
's
round
,
and
happy
in
the
anticipation
of
his
Sunday
's
dinner
;
but
he
be
a
good
-
tempered
man
,
who
find
it
difficult
to
keep
down
his
jovial
easiness
even
by
the
bed
of
sickness
or
death
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
mischosen
his
profession
;
for
it
be
his
delight
to
see
every
one
around
him
in
full
enjoyment
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
he
subdue
his
face
to
the
proper
expression
of
sympathy
,
befit
a
doctor
listen
to
a
patient
,
or
a
patient
's
friend
(
and
Mary
's
sad
,
pale
,
anxious
face
may
be
take
for
either
the
one
or
the
other
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
my
girl
!
<EOS>
and
what
bring
you
here
?
"
<EOS>
say
he
,
as
he
enter
his
surgery
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
on
your
own
account
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
to
come
and
see
Alice
Wilson
,
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
think
you
would
maybe
take
a
look
at
Mrs.
Wilson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
bustle
on
his
hat
and
coat
,
and
follow
Mary
instantly
.
  
<EOS>
after
shake
his
head
over
Alice
(
as
if
it
be
a
mournful
thing
for
one
so
pure
and
good
,
so
true
,
although
so
humble
a
Christian
,
to
be
near
her
desire
haven
)
,
and
mutter
the
accustomed
word
intend
to
destroy
hope
,
and
prepare
anticipation
,
he
go
,
in
compliance
with
Mary
's
look
,
to
ask
the
usual
question
of
Mrs.
Wilson
,
who
sit
passively
in
her
arm
-
chair
.
  
<EOS>
She
answer
his
question
,
and
submit
to
his
examination
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
think
her
?
"
ask
Mary
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
 
a
,
"
begin
he
,
perceive
that
he
be
desire
to
take
one
side
in
his
answer
,
and
unable
to
find
out
whether
his
listener
be
anxious
for
a
favourable
verdict
or
otherwise
;
but
think
it
most
probable
that
she
would
desire
the
former
,
he
continue
   
<EOS>
"
She
be
weak
,
certainly
;
the
natural
result
of
such
a
shock
as
the
arrest
of
her
son
would
be
,
 
for
I
understand
this
James
Wilson
,
who
murder
Mr.
Carson
,
be
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
sad
thing
to
have
such
a
reprobate

<EOS>
"
You
say

who
MURDERED

Mary
indignantly

He
be
only
take
up
on

have
no

of
his
innocence

<EOS>
"

well

well

<EOS>
doctor
have
seldom

I
dare

I
be
not

correct

I

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
indeed
,
young
woman

I
see
no
cause
for
apprehension
about
this
poor
creature
in
the
next
room
;
 
weak
 
certainly
;
but
a
day
or
two
's
good
nursing
will
set
her
up
,

I
be
sure
you
be
a
good
nurse

my
dear

from
your
pretty
kind

hearted
face

I
will
send
a
couple
of
pill

a
draught

do
not
alarm
yourself
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
occasion

I
assure
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
do
not
think
her
fit
to
go
to
Liverpool

ask
Mary
,
still
in
the
anxious
tone
of
one
who
wish
earnestly
for
some
particular
decision
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
Liverpool
 
yes
,
"
reply
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
a
short
journey
like
that
could
not
fatigue
,
and
may
distract
her
thought

<EOS>
let
her
go
by
all
mean

it
would
be
the
very
thing
for
her

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

o

burst
out
Mary

almost

I
do

she
be

ill

go

<EOS>
"
whew

<EOS>
say
he
,
with
a
prolong
whistle
,
try
to
understand
the
case
;
but
be
,
as
he
say
,
no
reader
of
newspaper
,
utterly
unaware
of
the
peculiar
reason
there
may
be
for
so
apparently
unfeele
a
wish
 
<EOS>
"
why
do
you
not
tell
me
so
sooner

It
may
certainly
do
her
harm

there
be
always

what
not

<EOS>
to
her

they
may
prove
very
injurious

very
.
 
<EOS>
I
disapprove
of
journey
,
or
excitement
,
in
all
case
where
the
patient
be
in
the
low
,
fluttered
state
in
which
Mrs.

be

<EOS>
if
you
take
my
advice

you
will
certainly
put
a
stop

<EOS>
He
really
have
completely
change
his
opinion

quite
unconsciously

desirous
be

with
the

would
have
do
it

my
dinner
wait
all
this
time

<EOS>
to
be
sure

never

be
aware

shake

now
Sally
have
a
grand
view
,
and
look
her
over
and
over
(
a
very
different
thing
from
look
her
through
and
through

,
and
almost
learn
her
off
by
heart
:
 
<EOS>
"
Her
every

day
gown
(
Hoyle
's
print
you
know
,
that
lilac
thing
with
the
high
body
)
<EOS>
she
be
so
fond
of
;
a
little
black
silk
handkerchief
just
knot
round
her
neck
,
like
a
boy
;
her
hair
all
take
back
from
her
face
,
as
if
she
want
to
keep
her
head
cool
 
<EOS>
she
would
always
keep
that
hair
of
hers
so
long
;
and
her
hand
twitch
continually
about
"
    
such
particular
would
make
Sally
into
a
Gazette
Extraordinary
the
next
morning
at
the
workroom
and
be
worth
come
for
,
even
if
little
else
could
be
extract
from
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
Mary
!
<EOS>
"
she
begin

<EOS>
"
where

you

yourself

You

sorry
for

as

stiff

cold
for
your

Mary

we
shall
ne'er
cast
it
up

Miss
Simmonds
,
too

will
be
mighty
put
out
if
you

<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
,
you
will
have
to
be
in
Liverpool
,
Tuesday
,

maybe
Wednesday

after
that
you
will
surely
come
,
and
tell
us
all
about
it

<EOS>
Miss
Simmonds
know
you
will
have

off
those
two

between
you

she
be
a
bit
of
a
gossip

and
will
like
hear
all
<EOS>
how
and
about
the
trial
,
well
enough
to
let
you
off
very
easy
for
your

two

<EOS>
besides
,
Betsy
Morgan
be

yesterday
,
she
should
not
wonder
<EOS>
but
you
would
prove
quite
an
attraction

customer

<EOS>
many
a
one
would
come

have
their
gown
make
by

to
catch
a
glimpse
at

you
will
turn
out
quite
a

the
little
finger
twitch
bad
than
ever

the
large
soft
eye
look
up
pleadingly
into
Sally

face

but
she
go
on
in
the

strain
,
not
from
any
unkind
or
cruel
feeling
towards
Mary

solely
because
she

She

at
Mr.

death

at
the

the
excitement

rather
pleasant

off

fire
up

sink

have
be
settle
about

it

that

Sally

<EOS>
Mary
pause
;
she
be
go
on
too
fast
with
one
so
curious
and
so
unscrupulous
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
she
remember
how
even
she
herself
have
,
at
first
,
believe
him
guilty
;
and
she
feel
it
be
not
for
her
to
cast
stone
at
those
who
,
on
similar
evidence
,
incline
to
the
same
belief
.
 
<EOS>
none
have
give
him
much
benefit
of
a
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
none
have
faith
in
his
innocence
.
 
<EOS>
none
but
his
mother
;
and
the
heart
love
more
than
the
head
reason
,
and
her
yearning
affection
have
never
for
an
instant
entertain
the
idea
that
her
Jem
be
a
murderer

<EOS>
but
Mary
dislike
the
whole
conversation
;
the
subject
,
the
manner
in
which
it
be
treat
,
be
all
painful
,
and
she
have
a
repugnance
to
the
person
with
whom
she
speak

<EOS>
She
be
thankful
,
therefore
,
when
Job
Legh
's
voice
be
hear
at
the
door
,
as
he
stand
with
the
latch
in
his
hand
,
talk
to
a
neighbour
,
and
when
Sally
jump
up
in
vexation
and
say
,
"
there

your

Job
pass
each

at

door

with
mutual
look

dislike

neither
take
any
pain

"
She

very
good

natured

too
honourable
to
abuse

who
have
only
that
instant
cross
her
threshold

gladly
dwell
on
the
good
quality
most
apparent

Howe'er

I
have
see
Mr.

he
be
in
a
manner
the

mind
as
we
;
he
think
it
would
have
an
awkward
look

and
may
tell
against
the
poor
lad
on
his
trial

still

ill

I
do

so
bad

begin
to
dread
her
part

anything

may
tell
against

poor
lover

"
Will
you
come

doctor
seem
to
say
as
I

not

contempt

still

changeless

you
must
have
often
observe
in
the
house
of
sickness

mourning

no

go
on

people
watch

rather
than

in

more
sudden

violent
attack

little
movement
be
go
on

so
noiseless
and
hush

the
furniture
all
arrange
and
stationary

with
a

the
comfort

the
afflict

the
window

blind
draw
down

keep
out
the
disturbing
variety
of
a
sunbeam

the
same
sadden
serious
look
on
the
face
of
the
indweller

you
fall
back
into
the

train
of
thought
with
all
these
association

forget
the
street

the
outer

quietly
in

chair

look

about

incessant
talking

little
laugh

perhaps
in
sympathy

her
unseen
companion

unseen

I

so
quietly
that

It
make

deep
impression

illness
could
have
do

<EOS>
if
she
have
rave
in
delirium

he
could
have
speak

now

at

pull

aside
into

corner

place

Mrs.

begin
to
talk
to
her

Yo're
right

I
be
sure
you
would
think
so

say
Mary

<EOS>
but
they
be
reckon
without
their
host
.
 
<EOS>
They
esteem
her
sense
go
,
while
,
in
fact
,
they
be
only
inert
,
and
could
not
convey
impression
rapidly
to
the
overburden
,
troubled
brain

<EOS>
They
have
not
notice
that
her
eye
have
follow
them
(
mechanically
it
seem
at
first
)
as
they
have
move
away
to
the
corner
of
the
room
;
that
her
face
,
hitherto
so
changeless
,
have
begin
to
work
with
one
or
two
of
the
old
symptom
of
impatience

<EOS>
but
when
they
be
silent
she
stand
up
,
and
startle
them
almost
as
if
a
dead
person
have
speak
,
by
say
clearly

decidedly

him
at

him

his

all

They
will
let
me
go
to
him

<EOS>
maybe
,
the
very
minute
it
be
over
;

I
know
many
scripture

(
though
you
would
not

that
may
keep
up
his

I
miss
see
him
ere

he
go
to
yon
prison

nought
shall
keep
me
away
again
one
minute

I
can

his

for
maybe
the
minute

number

the
count

small

I
know
I
can
be
a
comfort
to
him

poor
lad

You
would
not

now

he
would
always
speak

kind

soft
to

He
love
me
above

I

leave
him
now
to
dree
all
the
cruel
slander
they
will
put
upon
him
?

I
can
pray
for
him
at
each
hard
word
they
say
against
him
,
if
I
can
do
nought
else
;
and
he
will
know
what
his

be
do
for
him
,
poor
lad
,
by
the
look
on
my
face
.

"
  
<EOS>
still
they
make
some
look
,
or
gesture
of
opposition
to
her
wish
.
<EOS>
She
turn
sharp
round
on
Mary
,
the
old
object
of
her
pettish
attack
,
and
say
,
"
now

wench

<EOS>
once
for
all

I
tell
you
this

<EOS>
he

what

I
shall
go

Liverpool
tomorrow

find
my

with
him
through
thick

perhaps

God

His

take
me

<EOS>
She
sink
back
in
her
chair
,
quite
exhausted
by
the
sudden
effort
she
have
make
;
but
if
they
even
offer
to
speak
,
she
cut
them
short
(
whatever
the
subject
may
be
)
,
with
the
repetition
of
the
same
word
,
"
I
shall
go
to
Liverpool
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
no
more
could
be

,
the
doctor

opinion
have
be
so
undecided
;
Mr.
Bridgnorth
have
give
his
legal
voice
in
favour
of
her
go

and
Mary
be
oblige
to
relinquish
the
idea
of
persuade
her
to
remain
at
home

indeed

under
all

it

I

I

not

up
Will

if
Jem

life
be

depend
on
it

"
  
<EOS>
now
Mary
dislike
this
plan
inexpressibly
;
her
dislike
be
partly
ground
on
reason
,
and
partly
on
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
depute
to
any
one
the
active
measure
necessary
to
be
take
in
order
to
save
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
She
feel
as
if
they
be
her
duty
,
<EOS>
her
right
.
 
<EOS>
She
durst
not
trust
to
any
one
the
completion
of
her
plan
:
they
may
not
have
energy
,
or
perseverance
,
or
desperation
enough
to
follow
out
the
slight
chance
;
and
her
love
would
endow
her
with
all
these
quality
independently
of
the
terrible
alternative
which
await
her
in
case
all
fail
and
Jem
be
condemn
.
 
<EOS>
no
one
could
have
her
motive
;
and
consequently
no
one
could
have
her
sharpen
brain
,
her
despairing
determination
.
 
<EOS>
besides
(
only
that
be
purely
selfish
)
,
she
could
not
endure
the
suspense
of
remain
quiet
,
and
only
know
the
result
when
all
be
accomplish
.
  
<EOS>
so
with
vehemence
and
impatience
she
rebut
every
reason
Job
adduce
for
his
plan
;
and
of
course
,
thus
oppose
,
by
what
appear
to
him
wilfulness
,
he
become
more
resolute
,
and
angry
word
be
exchange
,
and
a
feeling
of
estrangement
rise
up
between
them
,
for
a
time
,
as
they
walk
homeward
.
  
<EOS>
but
then
come
in
Margaret
with
her
gentleness
,
like
an
angel
of
peace
,
so
calm
and
reasonable

that
both
feel
ashamed
of
their
irritation
,
and
tacitly
leave
the
decision
to
her
(
only
,
by
the
way

I
think
Mary
could
never
have
submit
if
it
have
go
against

penitent

Margaret
have
still

you

little

hear
herself
from
him
that
Jem
have
not

would
have
speak
angrily
to
the
person
who
knock
so
gently
at
the
door

if
anger
have
be
in
her
nature
;
but
she
be
a
soft
,
helpless
kind
of
woman
,
and
only
sigh
over
the
many
interruption
she
have
have
to
her
business
that
unlucky
Monday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
feeling
which
would
have
be
anger
in
a
more
impatient
temper
,
take
the
form
of
prejudice
against
the
disturber
,
whoever
he
or
she
may
be
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
's
fluttered
and
excited
appearance
strengthen
this
prejudice
in
Mrs.
Jones
's
mind
,
as
she
stand
,
strip
the
soap
-
sud
off
her
arm
,
while
she
eye
her
visitor
,
and
wait
to
be
tell
what
her
business
be

no
word
would
come

Mary

up
in

"

<EOS>
and
again

seem
close

Mary
bent
forwards
with
suppliant
action
(
as

by

rough

autumnal
wind

out

Mrs.

suspect
some

the
distress
of
the
pale
young

before
her

so
obvious

so
pitiable

that

reserved

distant

spicy
or
frozen

that
send
to
that
mighty

for
their
comfort
or
their
luxury
;
she
see
small
boat
pass
to
and
fro
on
that
glitter
highway
,
but
she
also
see
such
puff
and
cloud
of
smoke
from
the
countless
steamer
,
that
she
wonder
at
Charley

intolerance
of
the
smoke
of
Manchester

<EOS>
across
the
swing

bridge
,
along
the
pier
,
 
and
they
stand
breathless
by
a
magnificent
dock
,
where
hundred
of
ship
lie
motionless
during
the
process
of
loading
and
unloading
.
 
<EOS>
the
cry
of
the
sailor
,
the
variety
of
language
use
by
the
passer
-
by
,
and
the
entire
novelty
of
the
sight
compare
with
anything
which
Mary
have
ever
see
,
make
her
feel
most
helpless
and
forlorn
;
and
she
cling
to
her
young
guide
as
to
one
who
alone
by
his
superior
knowledge
could
interpret
between
her
and
the
new
race
of
man
by
whom
she
be
surround

for
a
new
race
sailor
may
reasonably
be
consider
,
to
a
girl
who
have
hitherto
see
none
but
inland
dweller

and
those
for
the
great
part
factory
people

<EOS>
in
that
new
world
of
sight
and
sound

she
still
bear
one
prevail
thought
,
and
though
her
eye
glance
over
the
ship

the
wide
-
spread
river

her
mind
be
full
of
the
thought

<EOS>
"
why
be
we
here
?
"
<EOS>
ask
she
of
Charley

<EOS>
"
there
be
no
little
boat
about

I

"
<EOS>
to
be
sure
not

reply
he
,
rather
contemptuously
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
the
John
Cropper
lie
in
this
dock
,
and
I
know
many
of
the
sailor

and
if
I
could
see
one
I
know
,
I
would
ask
him
to
run
up
the
mast
,
and
see
if
he
could
catch
a
sight
of

in
the
offing

Mary
assent
quietly
to
this
speech
,
as
if
she
be
as
careless
as
Charley
seem
now
to
be
about
her
overtake
will
;
but
in
truth
her
heart
be
sink
within
her

she
no

feel
the
energy
which
have
hitherto
uphold
her

Her
bodily

give
way

cold

shivering

the
noonday
sun
beat
down
with
considerable
power
on
the
shadeless
spot
where
she

<EOS>
"
here

Tom
Bourne

say
Charley
;
and
alter
his
manner
from
the
patronising
key
in
which
he
have
speak
to
Mary
,
he
address
a
weather
-
beat
old
sailor
who
come
roll
along
the
pathway
where
they
stand
,
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
and
his
quid
in
his
mouth
,
with
very
much
the
air
of
one
who
have
nothing
to
do
but
look
about
him
,
and
spit
right
and
leave
;
address
this
old
tar
,
Charley
make
known
to
him
his
wish
in
slang
,
which
to
Mary
be
almost
inaudible
,
and
quite
unintelligible
,
and
which
I
be
too
much
of
a
land
-
lubber
to
repeat
correctly
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
watch
look
and
action
with
a
renovate
keenness
of
perception
.
  
<EOS>
She
see
the
old
man
listen
attentively
to
Charley

she
see
him
eye
her
over
from
head
to
foot
,
and
wind
up
his
inspection
with
a
little
nod
of
approbation
(
for
her
very
shabbiness
and
poverty
of
dress
be
creditable
sign
to
the
experienced
old
sailor
)
,
and
then
she
watch
him
leisurely
swing
himself
on
to
a
ship
in
the
basin
,
and
,
borrow
a
glass
,
run
up
the
mast
with
the
speed
of
a
monkey

<EOS>
"
He

<EOS>
say
she
,
in
affright
,
clutch
at
Charley

arm
,
and
judge
the
sailor
,
from
his
storm

mark
face

unsteady
walk
on

much
old

why

I

be
up

She
think
I
be
to
be
a
shoemaker

I
have
make
up
my

away

for

appear
in
no

roughly

after

she

They

They
see
a

<EOS>
there

not
a
breath
of

and
yet
it
be
cold
than
when
the
soft
violence
of
the
westerly
wind

<EOS>
the

renew
their

the

Mary
shiver
,
and
her
heart
sink
within
her
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
now
they
evidently
be
make
progress
.
 
<EOS>
then
the
steersman
point
to
a
ripple
line
on
the
river
only
a
little
way
off
,
and
the
man
disturb
Mary
,
who
be
watch
the
ship
that
lie
in
what

to
her
the
open
sea

to

at

She
give
a
little
start
,
and
rise
.
 
<EOS>
Her
patience
,
her
grief
,
and
perhaps
her
silence
,
have
begin
to
win
upon
the
man

<EOS>
"
Yon

<EOS>
Wind

right
now

<EOS>
He
have
forget
(
or
perhaps
he
do
not
like
to
remind
Mary
)
that
the
same
wind
which
now
bear
their
little
craft
along
with
easy
,
rapid
motion
,
would
also
be
favourable
to
the
John
Cropper

<EOS>
but
as
they
look
with
strain
eye
,
as
if
to
measure
the
decrease
distance
that
separate
them
from
her

they
see
her
sail
unfurl
and
flap
in
the
breeze
,
till
,
catch
the
right
point
,
they
belly
forth
into
white
roundness
,
and
the
ship
begin
to
plunge
and
heave
,
as
if
she
be
a
live
creature
,
impatient
to
be
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
They

heave

say
one
of
the

to
the
other

as
the
faint
musical
cry
of
the
sailor
come
float
over
the
water
that
still
separate
them
.
  
<EOS>
full
of
the
spirit
of
the
chase
,
though
as
yet
ignorant
of
Mary
's
motive
,
the
man
spring
to
hoist
another
sail

<EOS>
It
be
fully
as
much
as
the
boat
could
bear
,
in
the
keen
,
gusty
east
wind
which
be
now
blow
,
and
she
bend
,

upbraidingly

They

but
they

busy
with
all
the
confusion
prevalent
in

there

He

William

They

all

at

I

"
what

the

<EOS>
They
tell
her
,
and
she
gather
the
meaning
out
of
the
sailor

slang
which
envelop
it

<EOS>
there
be
a
hope
still
,
although
so
slight

<EOS>
"
how
far
do
the

go
with

"
  
<EOS>
to
different
distance
,
they

<EOS>
some
pilot
would
go
as
far
as
Holyhead
for
the
chance
of
the
homeward

other
only
take
the

over

Banks

<EOS>
some
captain
be
more
cautious
than
other
,
and
the
pilot
have
different
way
.
 
<EOS>
the
wind
be
against
the
homeward
-
bind
vessel
,
so
perhaps
the
pilot
aboard
the
John
Cropper
would
not
care
to
go
far
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
soon
would
he
come
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
three
boatman
,
and
three
opinion
,
vary
from
twelve
hour
to
two
day
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
the
man
who
give
his
vote
for
the
long
time
,
on
have
his
judgment
dispute
,
grow
stubborn
,
and
double
the
time
,
and
think
it
may
be
the
end
of
the
week
before
the
pilot
-
boat
come
home
.
  
<EOS>
They
begin
dispute
and
urge
reason
;
and
Mary
try
to
understand
them
;
but
independently
of
their
nautical
language
,
a
veil
seem
draw
over
her
mind
,
and
she
have
no
clear
perception
of
anything
that
pass
.
 
<EOS>
Her
very
word
seem
not
her
own
,
and
beyond
her
power
of
control
,
for
she
find
herself
speak
quite
differently
to
what
she
mean
.
  
<EOS>
one
by
one
<EOS>
her
hope
have
fall
away
,

leave
her
desolate

and
though
a
chance
yet
remain
,
she
could
no
longer
hope
.
 
<EOS>
She
feel
certain
it
,
too
,
would
fade
and
vanish
.
 
<EOS>
She
sink
into
a
kind
of
stupor
.
 
<EOS>
all
outward
object
harmonise
with
her
despair
 
<EOS>
the
gloomy
leaden
sky
 
<EOS>
the
deep
dark
water
below
,
of
a
still
heavy
shade
of
colour
 
<EOS>
the
cold
,
flat
yellow
shore
in
the
distance

which
no
ray
lighten
up
 
the
nipping

<EOS>
She
shiver
with
her
depression
of
mind
and
body

<EOS>
the
sail
be
take
down
,
of
course
,
on
the
return
to
Liverpool
,
and
the
progress
they
make
,
row
and
tacking
,
be
very
slow
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
talk
together
,
dispute
about
the
pilot
at
first
,
and
then
about
matter
of
local
importance
,
in
which
Mary
would
have
take
no
interest
at
any
time
,
and
she
gradually
become
drowsy
;
<EOS>
irrepressibly
so
,
indeed
,
for
in
spite
of
her
jerk
effort
to
keep
awake
,
she
sink
away
to
the
bottom
of
the
boat
,
and
there
lie
crouched
on
a
rough
heap
of
sail
,
rope
,
and
tackle
of
various
kind
.
  
<EOS>
the
measured
beat
of
the
water
against
the
side
of
the
boat
,
and
the
musical
boom
of
the
more
distant
wave
,
be
more
lulling
than
silence
,
and
she
sleep
sound
.
  
<EOS>
once
she
open
her
eye
heavily
,
and
dimly
see
the
old
grey
,
rough
boatman
(
who
have
stand
out
the
most
obstinately
for
the
full
fare
)
cover
her
with
his
thick
pea
-
jacket
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
take
it
off
on
purpose
,
and
be
do
it
tenderly
in
his
way
,
but
before
she
could
rouse
herself
up
to
thank
him
she
have
drop
off
to
sleep
again
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
in
the
dusk
of
evening
,
they
arrive
at
the
landing
-
place
from
which
they
have
start
some
hour
before
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
speak
to
Mary
,
but
though
she
mechanically
reply
,
she
do
not
stir
;
so
,
at
length
,
they
be
oblige
to
shake
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
stand
up
,
shiver
and
puzzle
as
to
her
whereabouts
.
  
<EOS>
"
now
tell
me
where
you
be
bind
to
,
missus
,
"
say
the
grey
old
man
,
"
and
maybe
I
can
put
you
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
slowly
comprehend
what
he
say
,
and
go
through
the
process
of
recollection
;
but
very
dimly
,
and
with
much
labour
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
her
hand
into
her
pocket
and
pull
out
her
purse
,
and
shake
its
content
into
the
man
's
hand
;
and
then
begin
meekly
to
unpin
her
shawl
,
although
they
have
turn
away
without
ask
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
!
no
!
"
say
the
old
man
,
who
linger
on
the
step
before
spring
into
the
boat
,
and
to
whom
she
mutely
offer
the
shawl
.
<EOS>
"
keep
it
!
<EOS>
we
donnot
want
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
only
for
to
try
you

<EOS>
some
folk

they

no

all
the

"
  
<EOS>
"

you

say
she
,
in
a
dull
,
low
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be

<EOS>
I
axe
that
question
afore

say
the
gruff
old
fellow
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know

<EOS>
I
be
a
stranger
,
"
reply
she
quietly
,
with
a
strange
absence
of
anxiety
under
the
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
you
mun
find
out
then
,

say
he
sharply
:

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
card
somewhere
as

she
answer
,
and
the
man
,
partly
relieve
,
jump
into
the
boat
,
which
be
now
push
off
to
make
way
for
the
arrival
from
some
steamer

<EOS>
Mary
feel
in
her
pocket
for
the
card
,
on
which
be
write
the
name
of
the
street
where
she
be
to

Mr.

at

o'clock

former
the
particular

some
respectable

<EOS>
It
be
not

<EOS>
She
try
to
brighten
her
perception
,
and
feel
again
,
and
take
out
the
little
article

pocket
contain

her
empty
purse
,
her
pocket

handkerchief

and
such
little

more
cloudy

<EOS>
She
strove
to
remember
where
Will

lodge
,
but
she
could
not

name
,
street
,
everything

pass
away

it
do
not

better
she
be

<EOS>
She
sit
down
quietly
on
the
top
step
of
the
landing

and
gaze
down
into
the
dark
,
dank
water
below

<EOS>
once
or
twice
a
spectral
thought
loom
among
the
shadow
of
her
brain
;
a
wonder
whether
beneath
that
cold
dismal
surface
there
would
not
be
rest
from
the
trouble
of
earth

<EOS>
but
she
could
not

before

two
consecutive
moment

and
she
forget
what
she
think
about
before
she
could
act
upon
it

<EOS>
so
she
continue
sit
motionless
,
without
look
up
,
or
regard
in
any
way
the
insult
to
which
she
be
subject

<EOS>
through
the
darkening
light
the
old
boatman
have
watch
her
:
interested
in
her
in
spite
of
himself
,
and
his
scolding
of
himself

<EOS>
when
the
landing

place
be
once
more
comparatively
clear

he
make
his
way
towards
it
,
across
boat
,
and
along
plank
,
swear
at
himself
while
he
do
so
for
an
old
fool

He
shake

She

at

Job

stand
upon

where
Mr.

at
Assize

<EOS>
He
have
leave
Mrs.

at
the
dwelling
of
a
friend
of
his

who
have
offer
him
a
room
for
the
old
woman
and
Mary
:
a
room
which
have
frequently
be
his
,
on
his
occasional
visit
to
Liverpool
,
but
which
he
be
thankful
now
to
have
obtain
for
them
,
as
his
own
sleeping
place
be
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
,
and
the
town
appear
crowded
and
disorderly
on
the
eve
of
the
Assizes
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
show
in
to
Mr.

who

Mary
and
Will
Wilson
have
not
yet
arrive
,
be
,
as
you
know
,
far
away
on
the
broad
sea
;
but
of
this
Job
of
course
know
nothing
,
and
he
do
not
as
yet
feel
much
anxiety
about
their
non
-
appearance
;
he
be
more
curious
to
know
the
result
of
Mr.
Bridgnorth
's
interview
that
morning
with
Jem
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
yes
,
"
say
Mr.
Bridgnorth
,
put
down
his
pen
,
"
I
have
see
him
,
but
to
little
purpose
,
I
be
afraid
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
very
impracticable
 
very
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
of
course
,
that
he
must
be
perfectly
open
with
me
,
or
else
I
could
not
be
prepare
for
the
weak
point
.
 
<EOS>
I
name
your
name
with
the
view
of
unlock
his
confidence
,
but
"
    
"
what
do
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
ask
Job
breathlessly
.
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
very
little
.
 
<EOS>
He
barely
answer
me
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
refuse
to
answer
some
question
 
positively
refuse
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
I
can
do
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
then
you
think
him
guilty
,
sir
?
"
say
Job
despondingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
I
do
not
,
"
reply
Mr.
Bridgnorth
,
quickly
and
decisively
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
much
less
than
I
do
before
I
see
him

<EOS>
the
impression
(
mind
,
'
tis
only
impression
;
I
rely
upon
your
caution
,
not
to
take
it
for
fact
)
  
the
impression
,
"
with
an
emphasis
on
the
word
,
"
he
give
me
be
,
that
he
know
something
about
the
affair
,
but
what
,
he
will
not
say
;
and
so
the
chance
be
,
if
he
persist
in
his
obstinacy
,
he
will
be
hang
.
<EOS>
that
be
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
begin
to
write
again
,
for
he
have
no
time
to
lose
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
he
must
not
be
hang
,
"
say
Job
with
vehemence
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bridgnorth
look
up
,
smile
a
little
,
but
shake
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
do
he
say
,
sir
,
if
I
may
be
so
bold
as
to
ask
?
"
<EOS>
continue
Job
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
word
be
few
enough
,
and
he
be
so
reserved
and
short
,
that
,
as
I
say
before
,
I
can
only
give
you
the
impression
they
convey
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
,
of
course
,
who
I
be
,
and
for
what
I
be
send
.
<EOS>
He
look
pleased
<EOS>
,
I
think
 
at
least
his
face
(
sad
enough
when
I
go
in
<EOS>
,
I
assure
ye
)
<EOS>
brighten
a
little
;
but
he
say
he
have
nothing
to
say
,
no
defence
to
make
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
him
if
he
be
guilty
,
then
;
and
,
by
way
of
open
his
heart
,
I
say
I
understand
he
have
have
provocation
enough
,
<EOS>
inasmuch
as
I
hear
that
the
girl
be
very
lovely
and
have
jilt
him
to
fall
desperately
in
love
with
that
handsome
young
Carson
(
poor
fellow
!
)
.
 
<EOS>
but
James
Wilson
do
not
speak
one
way
or
another
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
go
to
particular
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
him
if
the
gun
be
his
,
as
his
mother
have
declare
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
not
hear
of
her
admission
<EOS>
,
it
be
evident
,
from
his
quick
way
of
look
up
,
and
the
glance
of
his
eye
;
but
when
he
see
I
be
observe
him
,
he
hang
down
his
head
again
,
and
merely
say
she
be
right
;
it
be
his
gun
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
well
!
"
say
Job
impatiently
,
as
Mr.
Bridgnorth
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
little
more
to
tell
you
,
"
continue
that
gentleman

<EOS>

I
ask
him
to
inform
me
,
in
all
confidence
,
how
it
come
to
be
find
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
silent
for
a
time
,
and
then
refuse
.
 
<EOS>
not
only
refuse
to
answer
that
question
,
but
candidly
tell
me
he
would
not
say
another
word
on
the
subject
,
and
,
thank
me
for
my
trouble
and
interest
in
his
behalf
,
he
all
but
dismiss
me
.
 
<EOS>
ungracious
enough
on
the
whole
,
be
it
not
,
Mr.
Legh
?
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
I
assure
ye
,
<EOS>
I
be
twenty
time
more
inclined
to
think
him
innocent
than
before
I
have
the
interview
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
Mary
Barton
would
come

Job
anxiously

She

long
time
about
it

ay

Mr.

Mr.

Mr.

Saturday
night

<EOS>
though
,
after
all
,
jury
go
very
little
by
such
general
and
vague
testimony
as
that
to
character
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
right
that
they
should
not
often
;
but
in
this
instance
unfortunate
for
us

as
we
must
rest
our
case
on
the
alibi

<EOS>
the
pen
go
again

scratch
,
scratch
over
the
paper

<EOS>
Job
grow
very
fidgety
.
 
<EOS>
He
sit
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
,
the
more
readily
to
start
up
when
Will
and
Mary
should
appear
.
 
<EOS>
He
listen
intently
to
every
noise
and
every
step
on
the
stair
.
  
<EOS>
once
he
hear
a
man
's
footstep
,
and
his
old
heart
give
a
leap
of
delight
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
only
Mr.
Bridgnorth
's
clerk
,
bring
him
a
list
of
those
case
in
which
the
grand
jury
have
find
true
bill
.
<EOS>
He
glance
it
over
and
push
it
to
Job
,
merely
say
   
<EOS>
"
of
course
we
expect
this
,
"
and
go
on
with
his
writing
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
true
bill
against
James
Wilson
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
Job
feel
now
doubly
anxious
and
sad
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
the
beginning
of
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
get
,
by
imperceptible
degree
,
to
think
Jem
innocent
.
<EOS>
little
by
little
this
persuasion
have
come
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
(
toss
about
in
the
little
boat
on
the
broad
river
)
do
not
come
,
nor
do
Will
.
  
<EOS>
Job
grow
very
restless
.
 
<EOS>
He
long
to
go
and
watch
for
them
out
of
the
window
,
but
fear
to
interrupt
Mr.
Bridgnorth
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
his
desire
to
look
out
be
irresistible
,
and
he
get
up
and
walk
carefully
and
gently
across
the
room
,
his
boot
creak
at
every
cautious
step
.
 
<EOS>
the
gloom
which
have
overspread
the
sky
,
and
the
influence
of
which
have
be
feel
by
Mary
on
the
open
water
,
be
yet
more
perceptible
in
the
dark
,
dull
street
.
 
<EOS>
Job
grow
more
and
more
fidgety
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
oblige
to
walk
about
the
room
,
for
he
could
not
keep
still
;
and
he
do
so
,
regardless
of
Mr.
Bridgnorth
's
impatient
little
motion
and
noise
,
as
the
slow
,
stealthy
,
creak
movement
be
hear
,
backwards
and
forwards
,
behind
his
chair
.
  
<EOS>
He
really
like
Job
,
and
be
interested
for
Jem
,
else
his
nervousness
would
have
overcome
his
sympathy
long
before
it
do
.
<EOS>
but
he
could
hold
out
no
longer
against
the
monotonous
,
grate
sound
;
so
at
last
he
throw
down
his
pen
,
lock
his
portfolio
,
and
take
up
his
hat
and
glove
,
he
tell
Job
he
must
go
to
the
court

<EOS>
"
but
Will
Wilson
be
not
come

say
Job
in
dismay
.
 
<EOS>
"
just
wait
while
I
run
to
his
lodging

<EOS>
I
would
have
do
it
before
,
but
I
think
they
would
be
here
every
minute
,
and
I
be
afraid
of
miss
them

<EOS>
I
will
be
back
in
no
time

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
my
good
fellow
,
I
really
must
go
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
I
begin
to
think
Johnson
must
have
make
a
mistake
,
and
have
fix
with
this
William
Wilson
to
meet
me
at
the
court
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
like
to
wait
for
him
here
,
pray
make
use
of
my
room
;
but
I
have
a
notion
I
shall
find
him
there
:
in
which
case
,
I
will
send
him
to
your
lodging
;
shall
I
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
where
to
find
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
here
again
by
eight
o'clock
,
and
with
the
evidence
of
this
witness
that
be
to
prove
the
alibi
,
I
will
have
the
brief
draw
out
,
and
in
the
hand
of
counsel
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
so
say
he
shake
hand
with
Job
,
and
go
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
consider
for
a
minute
as
he
linger
at
the
door
,
and
then
bend
his
step
towards
Mrs.
Jones
's
,
where
he
know
(
from
reference
to
queer
,
odd
,
heterogeneous
memorandum
,
in
an
ancient
black
-
leather
pocket
-
book
)
that
Will
lodge
,
and
where
he
doubt
not
he
should
hear
both
of
him
and
of
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
He
go
there
,
and
gather
what
intelligence
he
could
out
of
Mrs.
Jones
's
slow
reply
.
  
<EOS>
He
ask
if
a
young
woman
have
be
there
that
morning
,
and
if
she
have
see
Will
Wilson
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
not
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
bless
you
,
because
he
have
sail
some
hour
before
she
come
ask
for
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
dead
silence
,
break
only
by
the
even
,
heavy
sound
of
Mrs.
Jones
's
ironing
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
the
young
woman
now
?
"
ask
Job
.
  
<EOS>
"
somewhere
down
at
the
dock
,
"
she
think
.
 
<EOS>
"
Charley
would
know
,
if
he
be
in

but
he
be
not

<EOS>
He
be
in
mischief

somewhere

other

she
have
no

boy
always
be

<EOS>
He
would
break
his
neck
some
day
,
she
know

;
<EOS>
so
say
,
she
quietly
spit
upon
her
fresh
iron
,
to
test
its
heat
,
and
then
go
on
with
her
business
.
  
<EOS>
Job
could
have
box
her
,
he
be
in
such
a
state
of
irritation
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
do
not
,
and
he
have
his
reward

<EOS>
Charley
come
in
,
whistle
with
an
air
of
indifference
,
assume

carry
off
his
knowledge
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
to
which
he
have
linger
about
the
dock
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
be
<EOS>
an
old
man
come
to
know
where
the
young
woman

go
out
with
thee
this
morning

his
mother
,
after
she
have
bestow
on
him
a
little
motherly
scold
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
she
be
now
I
do
not
know

<EOS>
I
see
her
last
sailing
down
the
river
after
the
John
Cropper
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
<EOS>
afeard
she
will
not
reach
her
;
wind
change
,
and
she
would
be
under
weigh
,
and
over
the
bar
in
no
time

She
would
have
be
back
by
now

<EOS>
It
take
Job
some
little
time
to
understand
this
,
from
the
confused
use
of
the
feminine
pronoun
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
inquire
how
he
could
best
find
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
run
down
again
to
the

I
will
warrant
I
will
find
her

"
Thou

do
no
such
a

his

set
her
back
against
the
door

<EOS>
the
lad
make
a
comical
face
at
Job
,
which
meet
with
no
responsive
look
from
the
old
man
,
whose
sympathy
be
naturally
in
favour
of
the
parent
:
although
he
would
thankfully
have
avail
himself
of
Charley
's
offer
;
for
he
be
weary
,
and
anxious
to
return
to
poor
Mrs.
Wilson
,
who
would
be
wonder
what
have
become
of
him

<EOS>
"
how
can
I
best
find
her
?
 
<EOS>
who
do
she
go
with

lad

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
Charley
be
sullen
at
his
mother
's
exercise
of
authority
before
a
stranger
,
and
at
that
stranger
's
grave
look
when
he
mean
to
have
make
him
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
river
boatman

that
be
all
I

say
he

what

the

persevere
Job

I

oh

it

Prince

she

Johnson
tell

it
be

I
doubt
it
be

<EOS>
a

chase

Our

must
rest
on
the
uncertainty

circumstantial
evidence

the
goodness
of
the
prisoner

previous
character

a
very
vague
and
weak
defence

<EOS>
however

I
have
engage
Mr.
Clinton
as
counsel

he
will
make
the
good
of
it

and
now
,
my
good

I
must
wish
you
good

night

turn
you
out

as
it
be

I
shall
have
to
sit
up

do
you
see
my

upstairs

You

I
trouble
you

step
up
immediately

"
  
<EOS>
after
this
Job
could
not
stay

,
make

Job
be
silent

He
could
not

anything
further
that

so
he
rise
up

,
thank
Mrs.

for
the
shelter
she
have
give
him
<EOS>
,
he
go
out
into
the
street

there
he
stand
still

to
ponder
over
probability

chance

<EOS>
after
some
little
time
he
slowly
turn
towards
the
lodging
where
he
have
leave
Mrs.

<EOS>
there
be
nothing
else
to
be
do

but
he
loiter
on
the
way

fervently
hope
that
her
weariness

her
woe
may
have
send
her
to
sleep
before
his
return

that
he
may
be
spare
her
questioning

He

<EOS>
Job
give
no

mistaken

have
no
such

convince

that
some

be
decide
thing

He
lead

account

it
very

look
at

half
triumphantly

as
if

She

She

She

He

aside
the

Mary
attribute
this
to

finding

gather
up
her
strength
for
an
effort

she
instantly
recognise
the
unfavourable
point
at
which

seem
stationary

and
give
a
heavy
sigh

turn
into

poor

the
murder
man

perhaps
the
most
restless

He
have
sleep

little

the

his

probably
think

no

move
up

out
once
more

make
inquiry
for
Mary

and
when
he
could
hear
nothing
of

he
have
desperately
resolve
not
to
undeceive
Mrs.

,
as
sorrow
never
come

late

and
if
the
blow
be
inevitable
,
it
would
be
well
to
leave
her
in
ignorance

evil
as
long
as

She
take
her
place
in

wear

dispirited

He
do

dread

would

the
letter
run

"
dear
FRIEND
,
 
<EOS>
I
thank
you
heartily
for
your
goodness
in
find
me
a
lawyer
,
but
lawyer
can
do
no
good
to
me
,
whatever
they
may
do
to
other
people
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
not
the
less
obliged
to
you
,
dear
friend
.
 
<EOS>
I
foresee
thing
will
go
against
me
 
and
no
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
be
a
juryman
I
should
say
the
man
be
guilty
as
have
as
much
evidence
bring
against
him
as
may
be
bring
against
me
tomorrow
.
 
<EOS>
so
it
be
no
blame
to
them
if
they
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
Job
Legh
,
I
think
I
need
not
tell
you
I
be
as
guiltless
in
this
matter
as
the
babe
unborn
,
although
it
be
not
in
my
power
to
prove
it
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
do
not
believe
that
you
think
me
innocent
,
I
could
not
write
as
I
do
now
to
tell
you
my
wish

<EOS>
You
will
not
forget
they
be
the
word

a
man
shortly
to
die

<EOS>
dear
friend
,
you
must
take
care
of
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
not
in
the
money
way
,
for
she
will
have
enough
for
her
and
Aunt
Alice
;
but
you
must
let
her
talk
to
you
of
me
;
and
show
her
that
(
whatever
other
may
do
)
<EOS>
you
think
I
die
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
reckon
she
will
stay
long
behind
when
we
be
all
go
.
 
<EOS>
be
tender
with
her
,
Job
,
for
my
sake

and
if
she
be
a
bit
fractious
at
time
,
remember
what
she
have
go
through
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
mother
will
never
doubt
me
,
God
bless
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
one
other

I
fear
I
have
love
too
dearly
;
and
yet
,
the
love
her
have
make
the
happiness
of
my
life

<EOS>
She
will
think
I
have
murder
her
lover
:
she
will
think
I
have
cause
the
grief
she
must
be
feel
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
must
go
on
think
so
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
hard
upon
me
to
say
this
;
but
she
MUST
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
good
for
her
,
and
that
be
all
I
ought
to
think
on
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
dear
Job
,
you
be
a
hearty
fellow
for
your
time
of
life
,
and
may
live
many
year
to
come
;
and
perhaps
you
could
tell
her
,
when
you
feel
sure
you
be
draw
near
your
end
,
that
I
solemnly
tell
you
(
as
I
do
now
)
that
I
be
innocent
of
this
thing
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
tell
her
for
many
year
to
come
:
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
well
bear
to
think
on
her
live
through
a
long
life
,
and
hate
the
thought
of
me
as
the
murderer
of
him
she
love
,
and
die
with
that
hatred
to
me
in
her
heart

<EOS>
It
would
hurt
me
sore
in
the
other
world
to
see
the
look
of
it
in
her
face
,
as
it
would
be
,
till
she
be
tell
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
not
let
myself
think
on
how
she
must
be

me
now

Job
turn
the
letter
over

over
when
he
have
read
it

sigh
deeply
;

then
wrap
it
carefully
up
in
a
bit
of
newspaper
he
have
about
him
,
he
put
it
in
his
waistcoat
pocket

go
off
to

ask

against

her
fold
arm

rest

her
head
be
hide
within
them

It
be
an
attitude
of
hopelessness

have
serve
to
strike
Job
dumb
in
sickness
of
heart

even
without
the
sound
of
Mrs.
Wilson
's
voice
in
passionate
sobbing

sore
lamentation

which
tell
him
as
well

he
do
not

undeceived

hope

give
her

night

gabble
over
the
indictment

in

minute
or
two
there

the
accustomed
question

"
how

you
,
Guilty
or
not
guilty
?

"
  
<EOS>
although
but
one
answer
be
expect
,
 
be
customary
in
all
case
,
 
there
be
a
pause
of
dead
silence
,
an
interval
of
solemnity
even
in
this
hackneye
part
of
the
proceeding
;
while
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
stand
with
compress
lip
,
look
at
the
judge
with
his
outward
eye
,
but
with
far
other
and
different
scene
present
to
his
mental
vision
;
a
sort
of
rapid
recapitulation
of
his
life
,
 
remembrance
of
his
childhood
,
 
his
father
(
so
proud
of
him
,
his
first
-
bear
child
)
,
 
his
sweet
little
playfellow
,
Mary
,
 
his
hope
,
his
love
,
his
despair
,
 
yet
still
,
yet
ever
and
ever
,
his
love
,
 
the
blank
,
wide
world
<EOS>
it
have
be
without
her
love
,
 
his
mother
,
 
his
childless
mother
,
 
but
not
long
to
be
so
,
 
not
long
to
be
away
from
all
she
love
,
 
nor
during
that
time
to
be
oppress
with
doubt
as
to
his
innocence
,
sure
and
secure
of
her
darling
's
heart
;
 
he
start
from
his
instant
's
pause
,
and
say
in
a
low
firm
voice
  
"
not
guilty
,
my
lord
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
circumstance
of
the
murder
,
the
discovery
of
the
body
,
the
cause
of
suspicion
against
Jem
,
be
as
well
known
to
most
of
the
audience
as
they
be
to
you
,
so
there
be
some
little
buzz
of
conversation
go
on
among
the
people
while
the
lead
counsel
for
the
prosecution
make
his
very
effective
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
Mr.
Carson
,
the
father
,

behind
Serjeant
Wilkinson
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
noble

look
old
man
he
be
!
<EOS>
so
stern
and
inflexible
,
with
such
classical
feature
!
 
<EOS>
do
he
not
remind
you
of
some
of
the
bust
of
Jupiter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
more
interested
by
watch
the
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
criminal
always
interest
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
to
trace
in
the
feature
common
to
humanity
some
expression
of
the
crime
by
which
they
have
distinguish
themselves
from
their
kind
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
a
good
number
of
murderer
in
my
day
,
but
I
have
seldom
see
one
with
such
mark
of
Cain
on
his
countenance
as
the
man
at
the
bar
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
be
no
physiognomist
,
but
I
do
not
think
his
face
strike
me
as
bad
.
 
<EOS>
It
certainly
be
gloomy
and
depressed
,
and
not
unnaturally
so
,
consider
his
situation
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
only
look
at
his
low
,
resolute
brow
,
his
downcast
eye
,
his
white
compress
lip
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
look
up
,
 
just
watch
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
forehead
be
not
so
low
if
he
have
that
mass
of
black
hair
remove
,
and
be
very
square
,
which
some
people
say
be
a
good
sign
.
<EOS>
if
other
be
to
be
influence
by
such
trifle
as
you
be
,
it
would
have
be
much
well
if
the
prison
barber
have
cut
his
hair
a
little
previous
to
the
trial
;
and
as
for
downcast
eye
,
and
compress
lip
,
it
be
all
part
and
parcel
of
his
inward
agitation
just
now
;
nothing
to
do
with
character
,
my
good
fellow

"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Jem
!
 
<EOS>
His
raven
hair
(
his
mother
's
pride
,
and
so
often
fondly
caress
by
her
finger
)
,
be
that
,
too
,
to
have
its
influence
against
him

<EOS>
the
witness
be
call
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
they
consist
principally
of
policeman
;
who
,
be
much
accustom
to
give
evidence
,
know
what
be
the
material
point
they
be
call
on
to
prove
,
and
do
not
lose
the
time
of
the
court
in
listen
to
anything
unnecessary

"
clear
as

whisper
one
attorney

clerk

another

<EOS>
"
black
as

they
both
smile

"

rather
hard

both
be
silent

as
one
of

officer

court
usher
Mrs.

box

<EOS>
I
have
often
call
her
"
the
old
woman
,
"
and
"
an
old
woman
,
"
because
,
in
truth
,
her
appearance
be
so
much
beyond
her
year
,
which
could
not
be
many
above
fifty
.
 
<EOS>
but
partly
owing
to
her
accident
in
early
life
,
which
leave
a
stamp
of
pain
upon
her
face
,
partly
owing
to
her
anxious
temper

partly
to
her
sorrow

and
partly
to
her
limping
gait
,
she
always
give
me
the
idea
of
age

<EOS>
but
now
she
may
have
seem
more
than
seventy

her
line
be
so
set

deep

her

so
sharpened

her
walk
so
feeble

She

try

into
composure

(
unconsciously

she

uncontrolled
impatience

He
have
bury
his
face
in
his
arm
,
which
rest
on
the
front
of
the
dock
(
an
attitude
he
retain
during
the
great
part
of
his
trial
,
and
which
prejudice
many
against
him

the
counsel
begin
the
examination

<EOS>
"
Your

yes

with
quiver
voice

ready
to
break
out
into
weeping

earn
respect
by
the
strong
effort
at
self

control

prompt
,
as
I
have
say
before
,
by
her
earnest
wish
to
please
her
son
by
her
behaviour

<EOS>
the
barrister
now
proceed
to
the
important
part
of
the
examination
,
tend
to
prove
that
the
gun
find
on
the
scene
of
the
murder
be
the
prisoner
's
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
commit
herself
so
fully
to
the
policeman
,
that
she
could
not
well
retract
;
so
without
much
delay
in
bring
the
question
round
to

make

parch
tongue
utter
word

at
last
she
moan
forth
   
"

oh
!
<EOS>
Jem

Jem

<EOS>
what
mun
I
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
every
one
bent
forward
to
hear
the
prisoner
's
answer
;
although
,
in
fact
,
it
be
of
little
importance
to
the
issue
of
the
trial

He
lift
up
his
head
;

with
a
face
brim
full
of
pity
for
his
mother
,
yet
resolve
into
endurance

say
   
"

tell
the
truth

mother

so
she
do
,
with
the
fidelity
of
a
little
child
.
 
<EOS>
every
one
feel
that
she
do
;
and
the
little
colloquy
between
mother
and
son
do
them
some
slight
service
in
the
opinion
of
the
audience

the
awful
judge
sit
unmoved
;

the
jurymen
change
not
a
muscle
of
their
countenance
;
while
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
go
triumphantly
through
this
part
of
the
case
,
include
the
fact
of
Jem
's
absence
from
home
on
the
night
of
the
murder

bring
every
admission
to
bear
right

It
be
over

She
be
tell
to
go
down

she
could
no

compel
her
mother

heart
to
keep
silence

suddenly
turn
towards
the
judge
(
with
whom
she
imagine
the
verdict
to
rest

she
thus
address
him

choke
voice

I

who

and
have
nurse
him
on
my
knee

and
be
gladden
by
the
sight

him
every
day

ought

better

against
her
heart

My
lord
judge
,
he
be
so
good
<EOS>
I
often
wonder
what
harm
there
be
in
him
;
many
be
the
time
when
I
have
be
fret
(
for
I
be
frabbit
enough
at
time
)
,
when
I
have
scold't
myself
,
and
say
:
"
You
ungrateful
thing
,
the
Lord
God
have
give
you
Jem
,
and
be
not
that
blessing
enough
for
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
but
He
have
see
fit
to
punish
me
.
 
<EOS>
if
Jem
be
 
if
Jem
be
 
take
from
me
,
I
shall
be
a
childless
woman
;
and
very
poor
,
have
nought
leave
to
love
on
earth
,
and
I
can
not
say
"
His
will
be
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
,
my
lord
judge
,
oh
,
I
can
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
while
sob
out
these
word
she
be
lead
away
by
the
officer
of
the
court
,
but
tenderly
,
and
reverently
,
with
the
respect
which
great
sorrow
command
.
  
<EOS>
the
stream
of
evidence
go
on
and
on
,
gather
fresh
force
from
every
witness
who
be
examine
,
and
threaten
to
overwhelm
poor
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
already
they
have
prove
that
the
gun
be
his
,
that
he
have
be
hear
not
many
day
before
the
commission
of
the
deed
to
threaten
the
deceased
;
indeed
,
that
the
police
have
,
at
that
time
,
be
oblige
to
interfere
,
to
prevent
some
probable
act
of
violence
.
 
<EOS>
It
only
remain
to
bring
forward
a
sufficient
motive
for
the
threat
and
the
murder
.
 
<EOS>
the
clue
to
this
have
be
furnish
by
the
policeman
,
who
have
overhear
Jem
's
angry
language
to
Mr.
Carson
;
and
his
report
in
the
first
instance
have
occasion
the
sub
-
poena
to
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
and
now
she
be
to
be
call
on
to
bear
witness
.
 
<EOS>
the
court
be
by
this
time
almost
as
full
as
it
could
hold
;
but
fresh
attempt
be
be
make
to
squeeze
in
at
all
the
entrance
,
for
many
be
anxious
to
see
and
hear
this
part
of
the
trial
.
  
<EOS>
Old
Mr.
Carson
feel
an
additional
beat
at
his
heart
at
the
thought
of
see
the
fatal
Helen
,
the
cause
of
all
,
 
a
kind
of
interest
and
yet
repugnance
,
for
be
not
she
belove
by
the
dead
;
nay
,
perhaps
,
in
her
way
,
loving
and
mourn
for
the
same
being
that
he
himself
be
so
bitterly
grieve
over
?
 
<EOS>
and
yet
he
feel
as
if
he
abhor
her
and
her
rumour
loveliness
,
as
if
she
be
the
curse
against
him
;
and
he
grow
jealous
of
the
love
with
which
she
have
inspire
his
son
,
and
would
fain
have
deprive
her
of
even
her
natural
right
of
sorrow
over
her
lover
's
untimely
end
:
for
you
see
it
be
a
fixed
idea
in
the
mind
of
all
,
that
the
handsome
,
bright
,
gay
,
rich
young
gentleman
must
have
be
belove
in
preference
to
the
serious
,
almost
stern
-
look
smith
,
who
have
to
toil
for
his
daily
bread
.
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
<EOS>
the
effect
of
the
trial
have
equal
Mr.
Carson
's
most
sanguine
hope
,
and
a
severe
look
of
satisfaction
come
over
the
face
of
the
avenger
,
 
over
that
countenance
<EOS>
whence
<EOS>
the
smile
have
depart
,
never
more
to
return
.
  
<EOS>
all
eye
be
direct
to
the
door
through
which
the
witness
enter

<EOS>
even
Jem
look
up
to
catch
one
glimpse
before
he
hide
his
face
from
her
look
of
aversion
.
 
<EOS>
the
officer
have
go
to
fetch
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
in
exactly
the
same
attitude
as
when
Job
Legh
have
see
her
two
hour
before
through
the
half
-
open
door
.
 
<EOS>
not
a
finger
have
move
.
 
<EOS>
the
officer
summon
her
,
but
she
do
not
stir
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
<EOS>
so
still
,
he
think
she
have
fall
asleep
,
and
he
step
forward
and
touch
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
start
up
in
an
instant
,
and
follow
him
with
a
kind
of
rush
rapid
motion
into
the
court
,
into
the
witness
-
box
.
  
<EOS>
and
amid
all
that
sea
of
face
,
misty
and
swimming
before
her
eye
,
she
see
<EOS>
but
two
clear
bright
spot
,
distinct
and
fix
:
the
judge
,
who
may
have
to
condemn
;
and
the
prisoner
,
who
may
have
to
die
.
  
<EOS>
the
mellow
sunlight
stream
down
that
high
window
on
her
head
,
and
fall
on
the
rich
treasure
of
her
golden
hair
,
stuff
away
in
masse
under
her
little
bonnet
-
cap
;
and
in
those
warm
beam
the
mote
keep
dance
up
and
down
.
 
<EOS>
the
wind
have
change
 
have
change
almost
as
soon
as
she
have
give
up
her
watching
;
the
wind
have
change
,
and
she
heed
it
not
.
  
<EOS>
many
who
be
look
for
mere
flesh
and
blood
beauty
,
mere
colour
,
be
disappoint
;
for
her
face
be
deadly
white
,
and
almost
set
in
its
expression
,
while
a
mournful
bewildered
soul
look
out
of
the
depth
of
those
soft
,
deep
,
grey
eye
.
 
<EOS>
but
other
recognise
a
high
and
a
strange
kind
of
beauty
;
one
that
would
keep
its
hold
on
the
memory
for
many
after
year
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
there
myself
;
but
one
who
be
,
tell
me
that
her
look
,
and
indeed
her
whole
face
,
be
more
like
the
well
-
know
engraving
from
Guido
's
picture
of
"
Beatrice
Cenci
"
than
anything
else
he
could
give
me
an
idea
of
.
 
<EOS>
He
add
,
that
her
countenance
haunt
him
,
like
the
remembrance
of
some
wild
sad
melody
,
hear
in
childhood
;
that
it
would
perpetually
recur
with
its
mute
imploring
agony
.
  
<EOS>
with
all
the
court
reel
before
her
(
always
save
and
except
those
awful
two
)
,
she
hear
a
voice
speak
,
and
answer
the
simple
inquiry
(
something
about
her
name
)
<EOS>
mechanically
,
as
if
in
a
dream
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
go
on
for
two
or
three
more
question
,
with
a
strange
wonder
in
her
brain
,
at
the
reality
of
the
terrible
circumstance
in
which
she
be
place
.
  
<EOS>
suddenly
she
be
rouse
,
she
know
not
how
or
by
what
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
conscious
that
all
be
real
,
that
hundred
be
look
at
her
,
that
true
-
sound
word
be
be
extract
from
her
;
<EOS>
that
that
figure
,
so
bow
down
,
with
the
face
conceal
with
both
hand
,
be
really
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
flush
scarlet
,
and
then
,
paler
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
dread
of
herself
,
with
the
tremendous
secret
imprison
within
her
,
she
exert
every
power
she
have
to
keep
in
the
full
understanding
of
what
be
go
on
,
of
what
she
be
ask
,
and
of
what
she
answer
.
<EOS>
with
all
her
faculty
preternaturally
alive
and
sensitive
,
she
hear
the
next
question
from
the
pert
young
barrister
,
who
be
delighted
to
have
the
examination
of
this
witness
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
pray
,
may
I
ask
,
which
be
the
favoured
lover
?
 
<EOS>
You
say
you
know
both
these
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
which
be
the
favoured
lover
?
 
<EOS>
which
do
you
prefer
?
"
  
<EOS>
and
who
be
he
,
the
questioner
,
that
he
should
dare
so
lightly
to
ask
of
her
heart
's
secret
?
 
<EOS>
that
he
should
dare
to
ask
her
to
tell
,
before
that
multitude
assemble
there
,
what
woman
usually
whisper
with
blush
and
tear
,
and
many
hesitation
,
to
one
ear
alone
?
  
<EOS>
so
,
for
an
instant
,
a
look
of
indignation
contract
Mary
's
brow
,
as
she
steadily
meet
the
eye
of
the
impertinent
counsellor
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
in
that
instant
,
she
see
the
hand
remove
from
a
face
beyond
,
behind
;
and
a
countenance
reveal
of
such
intense
love
and
woe
,
 
such
a
deprecating
dread
of
her
answer
;
and
suddenly
her
resolution
be
take
.
 
<EOS>
the
present
be
everything
;
the
future
,
that
vast
shroud
,
it
be
madden
to
think
upon
;
but
now
she
may
own
her
fault
,
but
now
she
may
even
own
her
love
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
when
the
beloved
stand
thus
,
abhor
of
man
,
there
would
be
no
feminine
shame
to
stand
between
her
and
her
avowal
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
also
turn
towards
the
judge
,
partly
to
mark
that
her
answer
be
not
give
to
the
monkeyfied
man
who
question
her
,
and
likewise
that
the
face
may
be
avert
from
,
and
her
eye
not
gaze
upon
,
the
form
that
contract
with
the
dread
of
the
word
he
anticipate
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
ask
me
which
of
them
two
I
like
best
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
I
like
Mr.
Harry
Carson
once
 
I
do
not
know
 
I
have
forget
;
but
I
love
James
Wilson
<EOS>
,
that
be
now
on
trial
,
above
what
tongue
can
tell
 
above
all
else
on
earth
put
together
;
and
I
love
him
now
better
than
ever
,
though
he
have
never
know
a
word
of
it
till
this
minute
.
 
<EOS>
for
you
see
,
sir
,
mother
die
before
I
be
thirteen
,
before
I
could
know
right
from
wrong
about
some
thing
;
and
I
be
giddy
and
vain
,
and
ready
to
listen
to
any
praise
of
my
good
look
;
and
this
poor
young
Mr.
Carson
fall
in
with
me
,
and
tell
me
he
love
me
;
and
I
be
foolish
enough
to
think
he
mean
me
marriage
:
a
mother
be
a
pitiful
loss
to
a
girl
,
sir
:
<EOS>
and
so
I
use
to
fancy
<EOS>
I
could
like
to
be
a
lady
,
and
rich
,
and
never
know
want
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
find
out
how
dearly
I
love
another
till
one
day
,
when
James
Wilson
ask
me
to
marry
him
,
and
I
be
very
hard
and
sharp
in
my
answer
(
for
indeed
,
<EOS>
sir
,
I
would
a
deal
to
bear
just
then
)
,
and
he
take
me
at
my
word
and
leave
me
;
and
from
that
day
to
this
I
have
never
speak
a
word
to
him
,
or
set
eye
on
him
;
though
I
would
fain
have
do
so
,
to
try
and
show
him
we
have
both
be
too
hasty
;
for
he
would
not
be
go
out
of
my
sight
above
a
minute
before
I
know
I
love
 
far
above
my
life
,
"
say
she
,
drop
her
voice
as
she
come
to
this
second
confession
of
the
strength
of
her
attachment
.
 
<EOS>
"
but
,
if
the
gentleman
ask
me
which
I
love
the
good
,
I
make
answer
,
I
be
flatter
by
Mr.
Carson
,
and
please
with
his
flattery
;
but
James
Wilson
,
I
"
  
<EOS>
She
cover
her
face
with
her
hand
,
to
hide
the
burn
scarlet
blush
,
which
even
dye
her
finger
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
pause
;
still
,
though
her
speech
may
inspire
pity
for
the
prisoner
,
it
only
strengthen
the
supposition
of
his
guilt
.
  
<EOS>
presently
the
counsellor
go
on
with
his
examination
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
have
see
young
Mr.
Carson
since
your
rejection
of
the
prisoner

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
often

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
speak

conclude
,
at
these

<EOS>

only
once
,
to
call
speak

what
be
the

you

you

rival

<EOS>
"
no

<EOS>
I
do
not
think
as
I
have
do
wrong
in
say
,
now
as
thing
stand
,
what
my
feeling
be
;

I
never
would
be
so
bold
as
to
tell
one
young
man
I
care

I
never
name

name

never

<EOS>
"
then
what
do
you
say
when
you
have
this
final
conversation
with
Mr.
Carson
?
 
<EOS>
You
can
give
me
the
substance

it

if
you
do
not
remember
the
word

<EOS>
"
I
will
try
,
sir
;
but
I
be
not
very
clear

<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
could
not
love
him
,
and
wish
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
him

<EOS>
He
do
his
good
to
over
-
persuade
me
,
but
I
keep
steady
,
and
at
last
I
run
off
.

you
never

to
him
again

never

now
,
young
woman

remember
you

do
you
ever
tell
the

at
the
bar
of
Mr.
Henry
Carson

attention
to
you

<EOS>
of
your
acquaintance

in
short

<EOS>
do
you
ever

excite
his
jealousy

boasting

so
far

you

"
<EOS>
never

I

she

never

I
be

what

to
this

I
can

out
who
tell
Jem

<EOS>
o
sir
,
may
not
I
go
down
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
for
she
feel
the
sense
,
the
composure
,
the
very
bodily
strength
which
she
have
compel
to
her
aid
for
a
time
,
suddenly
give
way

be
conscious
that
she
be
lose
all
command

there
be
no
occasion

detain
her
longer

she
have
do
her
part

<EOS>
She
may
go
down
.
 
<EOS>
the
evidence
be
still
strong
against
the
prisoner
;
but
now
he
stand
erect
and
firm
,
with
self
-
respect
in
his
attitude
,
and
a
look
of
determination
on
his
face

which
almost
make
it
appear
noble

<EOS>
yet
he
seem
lose
in

<EOS>
Job
Legh
have
all
this
time
be
try
to
soothe
and
comfort
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilson
,
who
would
first
be
in
the
court
,
in
order
to
see
her
darling
,
and
then
,
when
her
sobs
become
irrepressible
,
have
to
be
lead
out
into
the
open
air
,
and
sit
there
weep
,
on
the
step
of
the
court
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
who
would
have
take
charge
of
Mary
,
on
her
release
from
the
witness
-
box
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
know
,
if
Mrs.
Sturgis
,
the
boatman
's
wife
,
have
not
be
there
,
bring
by
her
interest
in
Mary
,
towards
whom
she
now
press
,
in
order
to
urge
her
to
leave
the
scene
of
the
trial
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
!
no
!
"
say
Mary
,
to
this
proposition
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
be
here

<EOS>
I
must
watch
that

him

"
oh

never

besides
,

have
change
,
and
that
be
in
his
favour

<EOS>
come
away
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
so
hot
,
and
first
white
and
then
red
;
I
be
sure
you
be
ill

<EOS>
just
come
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
I
do
not
know
about
anything
but
that
I
must
stay
,
"
reply
Mary
,
in
a
strange
hurried
manner
,
catch
hold
of
some
rail
as
if
she
fear
some
bodily
force
would
be
employ
to
remove
her
.
 
<EOS>
so
Mrs.
Sturgis
just
wait
patiently
by
her
,
every
now
and
then
peep
among
the
congregation
of
head
in
the
body
of
the
court
,
to
see
if
her
husband
be
still
there
.
 
<EOS>
and
there
he
always
be
to
be
see
,
look
and
listen
with
all
his
might
.
 
<EOS>
His
wife
feel
easy
that
he
would
not
be
want
her
at
home
until
the
trial
be
end
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
never
let
go
her
clutch
hold
on
the
rail
.
 
<EOS>
She
want
them
to
steady
her
,
in
that
heaving
,
whirl
court
.
 
<EOS>
She
think
the
feeling
of
something
hard
compress
within
her
hand
would
help
her
to
listen
,
for
it
be
such
pain
,
such
weary
pain
in
her
head
,
to
strive
to
attend
to
what
be
be
say
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
all
at
sea
,
sail
away
on
billowy
wave
,
and
every
one
speak
at
once
,
and
no
one
heed
her
father
,
who
be
call
on
them
to
be
silent
,
and
listen
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
then
again
,
for
a
brief
second
,
the
court
stand
still
,
and
she
could
see
the
judge
,
sit
up
there
like
an
idol
,
with
his
trapping
,
so
rigid
and
stiff
;
and
Jem
,
opposite
,
look
at
her
,
as
if
to
say
,
be
I
to
die
for
what
you
know
your
.
 
<EOS>
then
she
check
herself
,
and
by
a
great
struggle
bring
herself
round
to
an
instant
's
sanity
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
round
of
thought
never
stand
still
;
and
off
she
go
again
;
and
every
time
her
power
of
struggle
against
the
grow
delirium
grow
fainter
and
fainter
.
 
<EOS>
She
mutter
low
to
herself
,
but
no
one
hear
her
except
her
neighbour
,
Mrs.
Sturgis
;
all
be
too
closely
attend
to
the
case
for
the
prosecution
,
which
be
now
be
wind
up
.
  
<EOS>
the
counsel
for
the
prisoner
have
avoid
much
cross
-
examination
,
reserve
to
himself
the
right
of
call
the
witness
forward
again
;
for
he
have
receive
so
little
,
and
such
vague
instruction
,
and
understand
that
so
much
depend
on
the
evidence
of
one
who
be
not
forthcoming
,
that
in
fact
he
have
little
hope
of
establish
anything
like
a
show
of
a
defence
,
and
content
himself
with
watch
the
case
,
and
lie
in
wait
for
any
legal
objection
that
may
offer
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
He
lie
back
on
the
seat
,
occasionally
take
a
pinch
of
snuff
in
a
manner
intend
to
be
contemptuous
;
now
and
then
elevate
his
eyebrow
,
and
sometimes
exchange
a
little
note
with
Mr.
Bridgnorth
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
attorney
have
far
more
interest
in
the
case
than
the
barrister
,
to
which
he
be
perhaps
excite
by
his
poor
old
friend
Job
Legh
;
who
have
edge
and
wedge
himself
through
the
crowd
close
to
Mr.
Bridgnorth
's
elbow
,
send
thither
by
Ben
Sturgis
,
to
whom
he
have
be
"
introduce
"
by
Charley
Jones
,
and
who
have
account
for
Mary
's
disappearance
on
the
precede
day
,
and
speak
of
their
chase
,
their
fear
,
their
hope
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
be
tell
in
a
few
word
to
Mr.
Bridgnorth
 
so
few
,
that
they
give
him
but
a
confused
idea
,
that
time
be
of
value
;
and
this
he
name
to
his
counsel
,
who
now
rise
to
speak
for
the
defence
.
  
<EOS>
Job
Legh
look
about
for
Mary
,
now
he
have
gain
,
and
give
,
some
idea
of
the
position
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
he
see
her
,
stand
by
a
decent
-
look
woman
,
look
flushed
and
anxious
,
and
move
her
lip
incessantly
,
as
if
eagerly
talk
;
her
eye
never
rest
on
any
object
,
but
wander
about
as
if
in
search
of
something
.
 
<EOS>
Job
think
it
be
for
him
she
be
seek
,
and
he
struggle
to
get
round
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
succeed
,
she
take
no
notice
of
him
,
although
he
speak
to
her
,
but
still
keep
look
round
and
round
in
the
same
wild
,
restless

<EOS>
He
try
to
hear
the
low
quick
muttering
of
her
voice
,
as
he
catch
the
repetition
of
the
same
word
over
and
over
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
not
go
mad

<EOS>
I

They

people
tell
the
truth
when
they

I

I

<EOS>
suddenly
she
seem
to
become
aware
how
earnestly
Job
be
listen
(
with
mournful
attention
)
to
her
word
,
and
turn
sharp
round
upon
him
,
with
upbraid
for
his
eavesdropping
on
her
lip
<EOS>
,
she
catch
sight
of
something
,
 
or
some
one
,
 
who
even
in
that
state
,
have
power
to
arrest
her
attention
;
and
throw
up
her
arm
with
wild
energy
,
she
shriek
aloud
   
<EOS>
"
O
Jem
!
<EOS>
Jem
!
<EOS>
you
be
save
;
and
I
am
mad
"
and
be
instantly
seize
with
convulsion
.
 
<EOS>
with
much
commiseration
she
be
take
out
of
court
,
while
the
attention
of
many
be
divert
from
her
,
by
the
fierce
energy
with
which
a
sailor
force
his
way
over
rail
and
seat
,
against
turnkey
and
policeman
.
 
<EOS>
the
officer
of
the
court
oppose
this
forcible
manner
of
entrance
,
but
they
could
hardly
induce
the
offender
to
adopt
any
quieter
way
of
attain
his
object
,
and
tell
his
tale
in
the
witness
-
box
,
the
legitimate
place
.
 
<EOS>
for
Will
have
dwell
so
impatiently
on
the
danger
in
which
his
absence
would
place
his
cousin
,
that
even
yet
he
seem
to
fear
that
he
may
see
the
prisoner
carry
off
,
and
hang
,
before
he
could
pour
out
the
narrative
which
would
exculpate
him
.
 
<EOS>
as
for
Job
Legh
,
his
feeling
be
all
but
uncontrollable
;
as
you
may
judge
by
the
indifference
with
which
he
see
Mary
borne
,
stiff
and
convulsed
,
out
of
the
court
,
in
the
charge
of
the
kind
Mrs.
Sturgis
,
who
,
you
will
remember
,
be
an
utter
stranger
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
keep
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
trouble
myself
about
her
,
"
say
he
to
himself
,
as
he
write
with
tremble
hand
a
little
note
of
information
to
Mr.
Bridgnorth
,
who
have
conjecture
,
when
Will
have
first
disturb
the
awful
tranquillity
of
the
life
-
and
-
death
court
,
that
the
witness
have
arrive
(
better
late
than
never
)
on
whose
evidence
rest
all
the
slight
chance
yet
remain
to
Jem
Wilson
of
escape
death
.
 
<EOS>
during
the
commotion
in
the
court
,
among
all
the
cry
and
command
,
the
dismay
and
the
direction
,
consequent
upon
Will
's
entrance
,
and
poor
Mary
's
fearful
attack
of
illness
,
Mr.
Bridgnorth
have
keep
his
lawyer
-
like
presence
of
mind
;
and
long
before
Job
Legh
's
almost
illegible
note
be
poke
at
him
,
he
have
recapitulate
the
fact
on
which
Will
have
to
give
evidence
,
and
the
manner
in
which
he
have
be
pursue
,
after
his
ship
have
take
her
leave
of
the
land
.
  
<EOS>
the
barrister
who
defend
Jem
take
new
heart
when
he
be
put
in
possession
of
these
striking
point
to
be
adduce
,
not
so
much
out
of
earnestness
to
save
the
prisoner
,
of
whose
innocence
he
be
still
doubtful
,
as
because
he
see
the
opportunity
for
the
display
of
forensic
eloquence
which
be
present
by
the
fact
;
"
a
gallant
tar
bring
back
from
the
pathless
ocean
by
a
girl
's
noble
daring
,
"
"
the
danger
of
too
hastily
judge
from
circumstantial
evidence
,
"
etc
.
<EOS>
etc
.
<EOS>
;
while
the
counsellor
for
the
prosecution
prepare
himself
by
fold
his
arm
,
elevate
his
eyebrow
,
and
put
his
lip
in
the
form
in
which
they
may
best
whistle
down
the
wind
such
evidence
as
may
be
produce
by
a
suborn
witness
,
who
dare
to
perjure
himself
.
 
<EOS>
for
,
of
course
,
it
be
etiquette
to
suppose
that
such
evidence
as
may
be
give
against
the
opinion
which
lawyer
be
pay
to
uphold
,
be
anything
but
base
on
truth
;
and
"
perjury
,
"
"
conspiracy
,
"
and
"
peril
of
your
immortal
soul
,
"
be
light
expression
to
throw
at
the
head
of
those
who
may
prove
(
not
the
speaker
,
there
would
then
be
some
excuse
for
the
hasty
word
of
personal
anger
,
but
)
<EOS>
the
hirer
of
the
speaker
to
be
wrong
,
or
mistake
.
  
<EOS>
but
when
once
Will
have
attain
his
end
,
and
feel
that
his
tale
,
or
part
of
a
tale
,
would
be
hear
by
judge
and
jury
;
when
once
he
see
Jem
stand
safe
and
well
before
him
(
even
though
he
see
him
pale
and
careworn
at
the
felon
'
bar
)
,
his
courage
take
the
shape
of
presence
of
mind
,
and
he
await
the
examination
with
a
calm
,
unflinching
intelligence
,
which
dictate
the
clear
and
most
pertinent
answer
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
the
story
you
know
<EOS>
so
well
:
how
his
leave
of
absence
be
nearly
expire
,
he
have
resolve
to
fulfil
his
promise
,
and
go
to
see
an
uncle
reside
in
the
Isle
of
Man
;
how
his
money
(
sailor
-
like
)
be
all
expend
in
Manchester
,
and
how
,
consequently
,
it
have
be
necessary
for
him
to
walk
to
Liverpool
,
which
he
have
accordingly
do
on
the
very
night
of
the
murder
,
accompany
as
far
as
hollin
Green
by
his
friend
and
cousin
,
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
clear
and
distinct
in
every
corroborative
circumstance
,
and
give
a
short
account
of
the
singular
way
in
which
he
have
be
recall
from
his
outward
-
bind
voyage
,
and
the
terrible
anxiety
he
have
feel
,
as
the
pilot
-
boat
have
struggle
home
against
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
the
jury
feel
that
their
opinion
(
so
nearly
decide
half
-
an
-
hour
ago
)
be
shake
and
disturb
in
a
very
uncomfortable
and
perplexing
way
,
and
be
almost
grateful
to
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
,
when
he
get
up
,
with
a
brow
of
thunder
,
to
demolish
the
evidence
,
which
be
so
bewildering
when
take
in
connection
with
everything
previously
adduce
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
such
,
without
look
to
the
consequence
,
be
the
first
impulsive
feeling
of
some
among
the
jury
<EOS>
,
how
shall
I
describe
the
vehemence
of
passion
which
possess
the
mind
of
poor
Mr.
Carson
,
as
he
see
the
effect
of
the
young
sailor
's
statement
?
 
<EOS>
It
never
shake
his
belief
in
Jem
's
guilt
in
the
least
,
that
attempt
at
an
alibi
;
his
hatred
,
his
longing
for
vengeance
,
have
once
define
an
object
to
itself
,
could
no
more
bear
to
be
frustrate
and
disappointed
than
the
beast
of
prey
can
submit
to
have
his
victim
take
from
his
hungry
jaw
.
 
<EOS>
no
more
likeness
to
the
calm
stern
power
of
Jupiter
be
there
in
that
white
eager
face
,
almost
distort
by
its
fell
anxiety
of
expression
.
  
<EOS>
the
counsel
to
whom
etiquette
assign
the
cross
-
examination
of
Will
,
catch
the
look
on
Mr.
Carson
's
face
,
and
in
his
desire
to
further
the
intense
wish
there
manifest
,
he
over
-
shoot
his
mark
even
in
his
first
insulting
question
   
"
<EOS>
and
now
,
my
man
,
you
have
tell
the
court
a
very
good
and
very
convincing
story
;
no
reasonable
man
ought
to
doubt
the
unstained
innocence
of
your
relation
at
the
bar
.
 
<EOS>
still
there
be
one
circumstance
you
have
forget
to
name
;
and
I
feel
that
without
it
your
evidence
be
rather
incomplete
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
have
the
kindness
to
inform
the
gentleman
of
the
jury
what
have
be
your
charge
for
repeat
this
very
plausible
story
?
 
<EOS>
how
much
good
coin
of
Her
Majesty
's
realm
have
you
receive
,
or
be
you
to
receive
,
for
walk
up
from
the
dock
,
or
some
less
credible
place
,
and
utter
the
tale
you
have
just
now
repeat
,
 
very
much
to
the
credit
of
your
instructor
,
I
must
say
?
 
<EOS>
Remember
,
sir
,
you
be
upon
oath
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
take
Will
a
minute
to
extract
the
meaning
from
the
garb
of
unaccustomed
word
in
which
it
be
invest
,
and
during
this
time
he
look
a
little
confused
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
instant
the
truth
flash
upon
him
<EOS>
he
fix
his
bright
clear
eye
,
flame
with
indignation
,
upon
the
counsellor
,
whose
look
fall
at
last
before
that
stern
unflinching
gaze
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
and
not
till
then
,
Will
make
answer
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
tell
the
judge
and
jury
how
much
money
you
have
be
pay
for
your
impudence
towards
one
who
have
tell
God
's
blessed
truth
,
and
who
would
scorn
to
tell
a
lie
,
or
blackguard
any
one
,
for
the
big
fee
as
ever
lawyer
get
for
do
dirty
work
?
 
<EOS>
Will
you
tell
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
ready
,
my
lord
judge
,
to
take
my
oath
as
many
time
as
your
lordship
or
the
jury
would
like
,
to
testify
to
thing
have
happen
just
as
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
O'Brien
,
the
pilot
,
in
court
now
.
<EOS>
Would
somebody
with
a
wig
on
please
to
ask
him
how
much
he
can
say
for
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
good
idea
,
and
catch
at
by
the
counsel
for
the
defence
.
<EOS>
O'Brien
give
just
such
testimony
as
be
require
to
clear
Will
from
all
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
witness
the
pursuit
,
he
have
hear
the
conversation
which
take
place
between
the
boat
and
the
ship
;
he
have
give
Will
a
homeward
passage
in
his
boat
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
character
of
an
accredited
pilot
,
appoint
by
the
Trinity
House
,
be
know
to
be
above
suspicion
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
sink
back
on
his
seat
in
sickening
despair
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
enough
of
court
to
be
aware
of
the
extreme
unwillingness
of
jury
to
convict
,
even
where
the
evidence
be
most
clear
,
when
the
penalty
of
such
conviction
be
death
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
period
of
the
trial
most
condemnatory
to
the
prisoner
,
he
have
repeat
this
fact
to
himself
,
in
order
to
damp
his
too
certain
expectation
for
a
conviction
.
 
<EOS>
now
it
need
not
repetition
,
for
it
force
itself
upon
his
consciousness
,
and
he
seem
to
KNOW
,
even
before
the
jury
retire
to
consult
,
that
by
some
trick
,
some
negligence
,
some
miserable
hocus
-
pocus
,
the
murderer
of
his
child
,
his
darling
,
his
Absalom
,
who
have
never
rebel
 
the
slayer
of
his
unburied
boy
would
slip
through
the
fang
of
justice
,
and
walk
free
and
unscathed
over
that
earth
where
his
son
would
never
more
be
see
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
even
so
.
 
<EOS>
the
prisoner
hide
his
face
once
more
to
shield
the
expression
of
an
emotion
he
could
not
control
,
from
the
notice
of
the
over
-
curious
;
Job
Legh
cease
his
eager
talk
to
Mr.
Bridgnorth
;
Charley
look
grave
and
earnest
;
for
the
jury
file
one
by
one
back
into
their
box
,
and
the
question
be
ask
to
which
such
an
awful
answer
may
be
give
.
  
<EOS>
the
verdict
they
have
come
to
be
unsatisfactory
to
themselves
at
last
;
neither
be
convince
of
his
innocence
,
nor
yet
quite
willing
to
believe
him
guilty
in
the
tooth
of
the
alibi
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
punishment
that
await
him
,
if
guilty
,
be
so
terrible
,
and
so
unnatural
a
sentence
for
man
to
pronounce
on
man
,
that
the
knowledge
of
it
have
weigh
down
the
scale
on
the
side
of
innocence
,
and
"
not
guilty
"
be
the
verdict
that
thrill
through
the
breathless
court
.
  
<EOS>
one
moment
of
silence
,
<EOS>
and
then
the
murmur
rise
,
as
the
verdict
be
discuss
by
all
with
lower
voice
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
stand
motionless
,
his
head
bow
;
poor
fellow
,
he
be
stun
with
the
rapid
career
of
event
during
the
last
few
hour
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
assume
his
place
at
the
bar
with
little
or
no
expectation
of
an
acquittal
;
and
with
scarcely
any
desire
for
life
,
in
the
complication
of
occurrence
tend
to
strengthen
the
idea
of
Mary
's
more
than
indifference
to
him
;
she
have
love
another
,
and
in
her
mind
Jem
believe
that
he
himself
must
be
regard
as
the
murderer
of
him
she
love
.
 
<EOS>
and
suddenly
,
athwart
this
gloom
which
make
life
seem
such
a
blank
expanse
of
desolation
,
there
flash
the
exquisite
delight
of
hear
Mary
's
avowal
of
love
,
make
the
future
all
glorious
,
if
a
future
in
this
world
he
may
hope
to
have
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
dwell
on
anything
but
her
word
,
tell
of
her
passionate
love
;
all
else
be
indistinct
,
nor
could
he
strive
to
make
it
otherwise
.
<EOS>
She
love
him
.
  
<EOS>
and
life
,
now
full
of
tender
image
,
suddenly
bright
with
all
exquisite
promise
,
hang
on
a
breath
,
the
slender
gossamer
chance
.
 
<EOS>
He
try
to
think
that
the
knowledge
of
her
love
would
soothe
him
even
in
his
die
hour
;
but
the
phantom
of
what
life
with
her
may
be
would
obtrude
,
and
make
him
almost
gasp
and
reel
under
the
uncertainty
he
be
endure
.
 
<EOS>
Will
's
appearance
have
only
add
to
the
intensity
of
this
suspense
.
  
<EOS>
the
full
meaning
of
the
verdict
could
not
at
once
penetrate
his
brain
.
 
<EOS>
He
stand
dizzy
and
motionless
.
 
<EOS>
some
one
pull
his
coat
.
<EOS>
He
turn
,
and
see
Job
Legh
,
the
tear
steal
down
his
brown
furrowed
cheek
,
while
he
try
in
vain
to
command
voice
enough
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
He
keep
shake
Jem
by
the
hand
,
as
the
good
and
necessary
expression
of
his
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
"
here
,
make
yourself
scarce
!
 
<EOS>
I
should
think
you
would
be
glad
to
get
out
of
that
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
the
gaoler
,
as
he
bring
up
another
livid
prisoner
,
from
out
whose
eye
come
the
anxiety
which
he
would
not
allow
any
other
feature
to
display
.
  
<EOS>
Job
Legh
press
out
of
court
,
and
Jem
follow
unreasoningly
.
  
<EOS>
the
crowd
make
way
,
and
keep
their
garment
tight
about
them
,
as
Jem
pass
,
for
about
him
there
still
hang
the
taint
of
the
murderer

<EOS>
He
be
in
the
open
air
,

the

be
   
<EOS>
"

They

him
to

They

tell
her

They
bring
her

throw
herself
upon

weep
there

He
return
her

look
around

beyond

there
be
no

sight

that

she

have
divine
the

<EOS>
long
ago
(
reckon
time
by
event
and
thought
,
and
not
by
clock
or
dial

plate
)
,
Jem
have
feel
certain
that
Mary
's
father
be
Harry
Carson
's
murderer
;
and
although
the
motive
be
in
some
measure
a
mystery
,
yet
a
whole
train
of
circumstance
(
the
principal
of
which
be
that
John
Barton
have
borrow
the
fatal
gun
only
two
day
before
)
<EOS>
have
leave
no
doubt
in
Jem
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
he
think
that
John
have
discover
,
and
thus
bloodily
resent
,
the
attention
which
Mr.
Carson
have
pay
to
his
daughter
;
at
other
,
he
believe
the
motive
to
exist
in
the
bitter
feud
between
the
master
and
their
work
-
people
,
in
which
Barton
be
know
to
take
so
keen
an
interest
.
 
<EOS>
but
if
he
have
feel
himself
pledge
to
preserve
this
secret
,
even
when
his
own
life
be
the
probable
penalty
,
and
he
believe
he
should
fall
execrate
by
Mary
as
the
guilty
destroyer
of
her
lover
,
how
much
more
be
he
bind
now
to
labour
to
prevent
any
word
of
hers
from
inculpate
her
father
,
now
that
she
be
his
own
;
now
that
she
have
brave
so
much
to
rescue
him
;

now
that
her
poor
brain
have
lose
all
guide
and
control
power
over
her
word
.
  
<EOS>
all
that
night
long
Jem
wander
up
and
down
the
narrow
precinct
of
Ben
Sturgis
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
little
bedroom
where
Mrs.
Sturgis
alternately
tend
Mary
,
and
weep
over
the
violence
of
her
illness
,
he
listen
to
her
raving
;
each
sentence
of
which
have
its
own
peculiar
meaning
and
reference
,
intelligible
to
his
mind
,
till
her
word
rise
to
the
wild
pitch
of
agony
,
that
no
one
could
alleviate
,
and
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
,
and
stole
,
sick
and
miserable
,
downstairs
,
where
Ben
Sturgis
think
it
his
duty
to
snore
away
in
an
arm
-
chair
instead
of
his
bed
,
under
the
idea
that
he
should
thus
be
more
ready
for
active
service
,
such
as
fetch
the
doctor
to
revisit
his
patient
.

before
it
be
fairly
light

Jem
(
wide
awake
,
and
listen
with
an
earnest
attention
he
could
not
deaden
,
however
painful
its
result
prove
)
hear
a
gentle
subdued
knock
at
the
house
door
;
it
be
no
business
of
his
,
to
be
sure
,
to
open
it
,
but
as
Ben
sleep
on
,
he
think
he
would
see
who
the
early
visitor
may
be
,
and
ascertain
if
there
be
any
occasion
for
disturb
either
host
or
hostess
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Job
Legh
who
stand
there

distinct
against
the
outer
light
of
the

<EOS>
"

choke
him

let
me
in

push
past

have
stand

unwilling

late
last
night
I
get
a
letter
from
Margaret

<EOS>
very
anxious

<EOS>
the

say
the
old

yonder
can
not

it
seem
so
lonesome
for
her
to
die
with
no
one
but
Margaret
and
Mrs.
Davenport
about
her

<EOS>
so
I
think
I
would
just
come
and
stay
with
Mary
Barton
,
and
see
as
she
be
well
do
to

you

on
with

Could
not

know

only
give
up

it
be

to
my

John

would
be
more
in

way

look
after

than
delegate
it
up

down

look

his
own

<EOS>
a
new
idea

<EOS>
what
if
Mary
should
implicate
her

rave
terribly

all

mix
up
thought

see
yesterday

now
you

Jem
feel
how
right
Job
be

could
not
resist
what
he
know
to
be
his
duty

I
can
not

you

heavy

sick
at
heart

fond

linger
look

float
behind

could
not

the
elasticity

have
be
crush
out

him
by
early
sorrow

now
,
especially
,
the
dark
side
of
everything
seem
to
be
present
to
him

<EOS>
what
if
she
die

just
when
he
know
the
treasure
,
the
untold
treasure
he
possess
in
her
love

<EOS>
what
if
(
bad
than
death

<EOS>
she
remain
a
poor
gibbering
maniac
all
her

mad
people

even
under

terror

distract

and
no

able
to
comfort
her
!
  
<EOS>
"
Jem
,
"
say
Job
,
partly
guess
the
other
's
feeling
by
his
own
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Jem
!
"
<EOS>
repeat
he
,
arrest
his
attention
before
he
speak

<EOS>
Jem
turn
round
,
the
little
motion
cause
the
tear
to
overflow
and
trickle
down
his
cheek

<EOS>
"
Thou
must
trust
in
God
,
and
leave
her
in
His
hand

<EOS>
He
speak
hush
,
and
low
;
but
the
word
sink
all
the
more
into
Jem
's
heart
,
and
give
him
strength
to
tear
himself
away
.
  
<EOS>
He
find
his
mother
(
notwithstanding
that
she
have
but
just
regain
her
child
through
Mary
's
instrumentality
)
half
inclined
to
resent
his
have
pass
the
night
in
anxious
devotion
to
the
poor
invalid
.
<EOS>
She
dwell
on
the
duty
of
child
to
their
parent
(
above
all
other
)
,
till
Jem
could
hardly
believe
the
relative
position
they
have
hold
only
yesterday
,
when
she
be
struggle
with
and
control
every
instinct
of
her
nature

only
because
he
wish
it
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
recollection
of
that
yesterday
,
with
its
hair's
-
breadth
between
him
and
a
felon
's
death
,
and
the
love
that
have
lighten
the
dark
shadow
,
make
him
bear
with
the
meekness
and
patience
of
a
true
-
hearted
man
all
the
worrying
little
acerbity
of
to

day
;
and
he
have
no
small
merit
in
do
so
;
for
in
him
,
as
in
his
mother
,
the
reaction
after
intense
excitement
have
produce
its
usual
effect
in
increase
irritability
of
the
nervous
system
.
  
<EOS>
They
find
Alice
alive
,
and
without
pain
.
 
<EOS>
and
that
be
all
.
 
<EOS>
a
child
of
a
few
week
old
would
have
have
more
bodily
strength
;
a
child
of
a
very
few
month
old
,
more
consciousness
of
what
be
pass
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
but
even
in
this
state
she
diffuse
an
atmosphere
of
peace
around
her
.
 
<EOS>
true
,
Will
,
at
first
,
weep
passionate
tear
at
the
sight
of
her
,
who
have
be
as
a
mother
to
him
,
so
stand
on
the
confine
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
but
even
now
,
as
always
,
loud
passionate
feeling
could
not
long
endure
in
the
calm
of
her
presence
.
 
<EOS>
the
firm
faith
which
her
mind
have
no
long
power
to
grasp
,
have
leave
its
trail
of
glory
;
for
by
no
other
word
can
I
call
the
bright
happy
look
which
illumine
the
old
earth
-
wear
face
.
 
<EOS>
Her
talk
,
it
be
true
,
bore
no
more
that
constant
earnest
reference
to
God
and
His
holy
Word
which
it
have
do
in
health
,
and
there
be
no
deathbed
word
of
exhortation
from
the
lip
of
one
so
habitually
pious
.
 
<EOS>
for
still
she
imagine
herself
once
again
in
the
happy
,
happy
realm
of
childhood
;
and
again
dwell
in
the
lovely
northern
haunt
where
she
have
so
often
long
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
though
earthly
sight
be
go
away
,
she
behold
again
the
scene
she
have
love
from
long
year
ago
!
<EOS>
she
see
them
without
a
change
to
dim
the
old
radiant
hue
.
 
<EOS>
the
long
dead
be
with
her
,
fresh
and
bloom
as
in
those
bygone
day
.
 
<EOS>
and
death
come
to
her
as
a
welcome
blessing
,
like
as
evening
come
to
the
weary
child
.
 
<EOS>
Her
work
here
be
finish
,
and
faithfully
do
.
  
<EOS>
what
well
sentence
can
an
emperor
wish
to
have
say
over
his
bi

<EOS>
in
second
childhood
(
that
blessing
cloud
by
a

)

her

good

<EOS>
dear

bless
me
once
more
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
very
tired
,
and
would
fain
go
to
sleep

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
never
speak
again
on
this
side
heaven
.
  
<EOS>
She
die
the
day
after
their
return
from
Liverpool
.
 
<EOS>
from
that
time
,
Jem
become
aware
that
his
mother
be
jealously
watch
for
some
word
or
sign
which
should
betoken
his
wish
to
return
to
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
go
to
Liverpool
<EOS>
he
must
and
would
,
as
soon
as
the
funeral
be
over
,
if
but
for
a
simple
glimpse
of
his
darling
.
 
<EOS>
for
Job
have
never
write
;
indeed
,
any
necessity
for
his
so
do
have
never
enter
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
if
Mary
die
,
he
would
announce
it
personally
;
if
she
recover
,
he
mean
to
bring
her
home
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Writing
be
to
him
little
more
than
an
auxiliary
to
natural
history
;
a
way
of
ticket
specimen
,
not
of
express
thought
.
  
<EOS>
the
consequence
of
this
want
of
intelligence
as
to
Mary
's
state
be
,
that
Jem
be
constantly
anticipate
that
every
person
and
every
scrap
of
paper
be
to
convey
to
him
the
news
of
her
death
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
endure
this
state
long
;
but
he
resolve
not
to
disturb
the
house
by
announce
to
his
mother
his
purposed
intention
of
return
to
Liverpool
,
until
the
dead
have
be
bury
forth
.
  
<EOS>
on
Sunday
afternoon
they
lay
her
low
with
many
tear
.
 
<EOS>
Will
wept
as
one
who
would
not
be
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
childish
feeling
come
over
him
,
the
feeling
of
loneliness
at
be
leave
among
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
by
-
and
-
by
,
Margaret
timidly
steal
near
him
,
as
if
wait
to
console
;
and
soon
his
passion
sink
down
to
grief
,
and
grief
give
way
to
melancholy
,
and
though
he
feel
as
if
he
never
could
be
joyful
again
,
he
be
all
the
while
unconsciously
approach
nearer
to
the
full
happiness
of
call
Margaret
his
own
,
and
a
golden
thread
be
interweave
even
now
with
the
darkness
of
his
sorrow
.
 
<EOS>
yet
it
be
on
his
arm
that
Jane
Wilson
leant
on
her
return
homeward
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
take
charge
of
Margaret
.
  
<EOS>
"
Margaret
,
I
be
bind
for
Liverpool
by
the
first
train
to
-
morrow
;
I
must
set
your
grandfather
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
sure
he
like
nothing
well
than
watch
over
poor
Mary
;
he
love
her
nearly
as
well
as
me
.
 
<EOS>
but
let
me
go
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
be
so
full
of
poor
Alice
<EOS>
,
I
have
never
think
of
it
before
;
I
can
not
do
so
much
as
many
a
one
,
but
Mary
will
like
to
have
a
woman
about
her
that
she
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
I
wait
to
be
remind
,
Jem
,
"
reply
Margaret
,
with
some
little
self
-
reproach
.
  
<EOS>
but
Margaret
's
proposition
do
not
at
all
agree
with
her
companion
's
wish
.
 
<EOS>
He
find
he
have
better
speak
out
,
and
put
his
intention
at
once
to
the
right
motive
;
the
subterfuge
about
set
Job
Legh
at
liberty
have
do
him
harm
instead
of
good
.
  
<EOS>
"
to
tell
truth
,
Margaret
,
it
be
I
that
must
go
,
and
that
for
my
own
sake
,
not
your
grandfather
's
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
rest
neither
by
night
nor
day
for
think
on
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
whether
she
live
or
die
,
I
look
on
her
as
my
wife
before
God
,
as
surely
and
solemnly
as
if
we
be
married
.
<EOS>
so
be
,
I
have
the
great
right
to
look
after
her
,
and
I
can
not
yield
it
even
to
"
    
"
Her
father
,
"
say
Margaret
,
finish
his
interrupted
sentence
.
<EOS>
"
It
seem
strange
that
a
girl
like
her
should
be
throw
on
the
bare
world
to
struggle
through
so
bad
an
illness
.
 
<EOS>
no
one
seem
to
know
where
John
Barton
be
,
else
I
think
of
get
Morris
to
write
him
a
letter
tell
him
about
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
he
be
home
,
that
I
do
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
could
not
echo
this
wish
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
be
not
bad
off
for
friend
where
she
be
,
"
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
call
them
friend
,
though
a
week
ago
we
none
of
us
know
there
be
such
folk
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
but
be
anxious
and
sorrowful
about
the
same
thing
make
people
friend
quicker
than
anything
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
like
a
mother
to
Mary
in
her
way
;
and
he
bear
a
good
character
,
as
far
as
I
could
learn
just
in
that
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
draw
near
home
,
and
<EOS>
I
have
not
say
my
say
,
Margaret
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
look
after
mother
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
not
like
my
going
,
and
I
have
get
to
break
it
to
her
yet
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
take
it
very
badly
,
I
will
come
back
to
-
morrow
night
;
but
if
she
be
not
against
it
very
much
,
I
mean
to
stay
till
it
be
settle
about
Mary
,
one
way
or
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Will
,
you
know
,
will
be
there
,
Margaret
,
to
help
a
bit
in
do
for
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Will
be
be
there
make
the
only
objection
Margaret
see
to
this
plan
.
 
<EOS>
She
dislike
the
idea
of
seem
to
throw
herself
in
his
way
,
and
yet
she
do
not
like
to
say
anything
of
this
feeling
to
Jem
,
who
have
all
along
seem
perfectly
unconscious
of
any
love
-
affair
,
besides
his
own
,
in
progress
.
  
<EOS>
so
Margaret
give
a
reluctant
consent
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
can
just
step
up
to
our
house
to
-
night
,
Jem
,
I
will
put
up
a
few
thing
as
may
be
useful
to
Mary
,
and
then
you
can
say
when
you
will
likely
be
back

<EOS>
if
you
come
home
to

morrow
night

and
Will
be
there
,
perhaps
I
need
not
step
up

<EOS>
"
yes
,
Margaret
,
do
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
not
leave
easy
unless
you
go
some
time
in
the
day
to
see
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
come
to
-
night
,
though
;
and
now
good

bye

<EOS>
Stay
!
<EOS>
do
you
think
you
could
just
coax
poor
Will
to
walk
a
bit
home
with
you
,
that
I
may
speak
to
mother
by
myself

"
  
<EOS>
no
!
that
Margaret
could
not
do
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
expect
too
great
a
sacrifice
of
bashful
feeling

<EOS>
but
the
object
be
accomplish
by
Will
's
go
upstairs
immediately
on
their
return
to
the
house
,
to
indulge
his
mournful
thought
alone

<EOS>
as
soon
as
Jem
and
his
mother
be
leave
by
themselves

he
begin
on
the
subject
uppermost
in
his
mind

<EOS>
"
mother
!

<EOS>
She
put
her
handkerchief
from
her
eye
,
and
turn
quickly
round
so
as
to
face
him
where
he
stand
,
think
what
good
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
the
little
action
annoy
him
,
and
he
rush
at
once
into
the
subject
.

"
Mother

be
go
back
to

morrow
morning
to
see
how

<EOS>

and
what
be
Mary
Barton
to
thee

that
thou
shouldst
be
run
after
her

a

way

His

be
choke
in
his
throat

<EOS>
for
an
instant
his
mother
be
interested
by
his
word
;
and
then
come
back
the
old
jealousy
of
be
supplant
in
the
affection
of
that
son

who
have
be
,
as
it
be
,
newly
bear
to
her
,
by
the
escape
he
have
so
lately
experience
from
danger

<EOS>
so
she
harden
her
heart
against

any
feeling
of
sympathy

turn
away
from
the
face

recall
the
earnest
look
of
his
childhood

when
he
have
come
to
her
in
some
trouble

sure
of
help

coldly

be
more
because

I
do

never

right

You

a

often

I

be
bind

when

off

when

come

without

without

and
so
it
be
with
them
that
be
hide

<EOS>
if
they
have
be
worthy
to

heartily

alive

they

not

it

we

no

in
God

ray
of

no

be
fearful
of

because
their

be
not

take
up

She
let
him
out
and
bolt
the
door
behind
him

<EOS>
He
stand
on
the
step
to
adjust
some
fasten
about
the
bundle
.
 
<EOS>
the
court
,
the
street
,
be
deeply
still
.
 
<EOS>
long
ago
all
have
retire
to
rest
on
that
quiet
Sabbath
evening
.
 
<EOS>
the
star
shine
down
on
the
silent
desert
street
,
and
the
clear
soft
moonlight
fall
in
bright
masse
,
leave
the
step
on
which
Jem
stand
in
shadow
.
  
<EOS>
a
footfall
be
hear
along
the
pavement
;
slow
and
heavy
be
the
sound
.
 
<EOS>
before
Jem
have
end
his
little
piece
of
business
,
a
form
have
glide
into
sight
;
a
wan
,
feeble
figure
,
bear
with
evident
and
painful
labour
a
jug
of
water
from
a
neighbouring
pump
.
 
<EOS>
It
go
before
Jem
,
turn
up
the
court
at
the
corner
of
which
he
be
stand
,
pass
into
the
broad
,
calm
light
;
and
there
,
with
bowed
head
,
sinking
and
shrunk
body
,
Jem
recognise
John
Barton
.
  
<EOS>
no
haunting
ghost
could
have
have
less
of
the
energy
of
life
in
its
involuntary
motion
than
he
,
who
,
nevertheless
,
go
on
with
the
same
measured
clockwork
tread
until
the
door
of
his
own
house
be
reach
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
disappear
,
and
the
latch
fall
feebly
to
,
and
make
a
faint
and
wavering
sound
,
break
the
solemn
silence
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
then
all
again
be
still
.
  
<EOS>
for
a
minute
or
two
Jem
stand
motionless
,
stun
by
the
thought
which
the
sight
of
Mary
's
father
have
call
up
.
  
<EOS>
Margaret
do
not
know
he
be
at
home
:
have
he
steal
like
a
thief
by
dead
of
night
into
his
own
dwelling
?
 
<EOS>
Depressed
as
Jem
have
often
and
long
see
him
<EOS>
,
this
night
there
be
something
different
about
him
still
;
beat
down
by
some
inward
storm
,
he
seem
to
grovel
along
,
all
self
-
respect
lose
and
go
.
  
<EOS>
Must
he
be
tell
of
Mary
's
state
?
 
<EOS>
Jem
feel
he
must
not
;
and
this
for
many
reason
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
inform
of
her
illness
without
many
other
particular
be
communicate
at
the
same
time
,
of
which
it
be
well
he
should
be
keep
in
ignorance
;
indeed
,
of
which
Mary
herself
could
alone
give
the
full
explanation
.
 
<EOS>
no
suspicion
that
he
be
the
criminal
seem
hitherto
to
have
be
excite
in
the
mind
of
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
add
to
these
reason
be
Jem
's
extreme
unwillingness
to
face
him
,
with
the
belief
in
his
breast
that
he
,
and
none
other
,
have
do
the
fearful
deed
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
true
that
he
be
Mary
's
father
,
and
as
such
have
every
right
to
be
tell
of
all
concern
her
;
but
suppose
he
be
,
and
that
he
follow
the
impulse
so
natural
to
a
father
,
and
wish
to
go
to
her
<EOS>
,
what
may
be
the
consequence
?
 
<EOS>
among
the
mingle
feeling
she
have
reveal
in
her
delirium
,
ay
,
mingle
even
with
the
most
tender
expression
of
love
for
her
father
,
be
a
sort
of
horror
of
him
;
a
dread
of
him
as
a
blood
-
shedder
,
which
seem
to
separate
him
into
two
person
,
 
one
,
the
father
who
have
dandle
her
on
his
knee
,
and
love
her
all
her
life
long
;
the
other
,
the
assassin
,
the
cause
of
all
her
trouble
and
woe
.
  
<EOS>
if
he
present
himself
before
her
while
this
idea
of
his
character
be
uppermost
,
who
may
tell
the
consequence
?
  
<EOS>
Jem
could
not
,
and
would
not
,
expose
her
to
any
such
fearful
chance
:
and
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
believe
he
look
upon
her
as
more
his
own
,
to
guard
from
all
shadow
of
injury
with
most
loving
care
,
than
as
belong
to
any
one
else
in
this
world
,
though
girt
with
the
reverend
name
of
Father
,
and
guiltless
of
aught
that
may
have
lessen
such
reverence
.
  
<EOS>
if
you
think
this
account
of
mine
confused
,
of
the
half
-
feeling
,
half
-
reason
,
which
pass
through
Jem
's
mind
,
as
he
stand
gaze
on
the
empty
space
,
where
that
crush
form
have
so
lately
be
see
,
 
if
you
be
perplex
to
disentangle
the
real
motive
,
I
do
assure
you
it
be
from
just
such
an
involved
set
of
thought
that
Jem
draw
the
resolution
to
act
as
if
he
have
not
see
that
phantom
likeness
of
John
Barton

himself
,

Mary
still
hover
between
life
and
death
when
Jem
arrive
at
the
house
where
she
lie
;
and
the
doctor
be
as
yet
unwilling
to
compromise
their
wisdom
by
allow
too
much
hope
to
be
entertain

<EOS>
but
the
state
of
thing
,
if
not
less
anxious
,
be
less
distressing
than
when
Jem
have
quit
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
lie
now
in
a
stupor
,
which
be
partly
disease
,
and
partly
exhaustion
after
the
previous
excitement

<EOS>
and
now
Jem
find
the
difficulty
which
every
one
who
have
watch
by
a
sick
-
bed
know
full
well
;
and
which
be
perhaps
more
insurmountable
to
man
than
it
be
to
woman
,
 
the
difficulty
of
be
patient
,
and
try
not
to
expect
any
visible
change
for
long
,
long
hour
of
sad
monotony
.
  
<EOS>
but
after
a
while
the
reward
come
.
 
<EOS>
the
laboured
breathing
become
low
and
soft
,
the
heavy
look
of
oppressive
pain
melt
away
from
the
face
,
and
a
languor
that
be
almost
peace
take
the
place
of
suffer
.
 
<EOS>
She
sleep
a
natural
sleep
;
and
they
steal
about
on
tiptoe
,
and
speak
low
,
and
softly
,
and
hardly
dare
to
breathe
,
however
much
they
long
to
sigh
out
their
thankful
relief

She
open
her
eye

Her
mind
be
in
the
tender
state
of
a
lately
bear
infant

She
be
pleased
with
the
gay
but
not
dazzle
colour
of
the
paper
;
soothe
by
the
subdued
light
;
and
quite
sufficiently
amuse
by
look
at
all
the
object
in
the
room
 
the
drawing
of
the
ship
,
the
festoon
of
the
curtain
,
the
bright
flower
on
the
paint
back
of
the
chair
 
to
care
for
any
strong
excitement

She
wonder
at
the
ball
of
glass

contain
various
coloured
sand
from
the
Isle
of
Wight

some
other
place

hang
suspend
from

she

not

exert
herself

ask

it
into

by
spoonful

do

the
tremble
eagerness
of
gesture

of
one

have
long
await
her
awakening

and
who
now
stand
behind
the
curtain
watch
through
some
little
chink
her
every
faint
motion

or
if
she
have
catch
a
glimpse

peep

she
be

without
a
word
have
be
speak
by
any
one
during
that
half
-
hour
of
inexpressible
joy
.
 
<EOS>
and
again
the
stillness
be
enforce
by
a
sign
and
whisper
word
,
but
with
eye
that
beam
out
their
bright
thought
of
hope
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
sit
by
the
side
of
the
bed
,
hold
back
the
little
curtain
,
and
gaze
as
if
he
could
never
gaze
his
fill
at
the
pale
,
waste
face
,
so
marbled
and
so
chisel
in
its
wan
outline
.
  
<EOS>
She
waken
once
more
;
her
soft
eye
open
,
and
meet
his
overbending
look
.
 
<EOS>
She
smile
gently
,
as
a
baby
do
when
it
see
its
mother
tend
its
little
cot
;
and
continue
her
innocent
,
infantine
gaze
into
his
face
,
as
if
the
sight
give
her
much
unconscious
pleasure
.
<EOS>
but
by
-
and
-
by
a
different
expression
come
into
her
sweet
eye
;
a
look
of
memory
and
intelligence
;
her
white
flesh
flush
the
bright
rosy
red
,
and
with
feeble
motion
she
try
to
hide
her
head
in
the
pillow
.
  
<EOS>
It
require
all
Jem
's
self
-
control
to
do
what
he
know
and
feel
to
be
necessary
,
to
call
Mrs.
Sturgis
,
who
be
quietly
doze
by
the
fireside
;
and
that
do
,
he
feel
almost
oblige
to
leave
the
room
to
keep
down
the
happy
agitation
which
would
gush
out
in
every
feature
,
every
gesture
,
and
every
tone
.
  
<EOS>
from
that
time
forward
Mary
's
progress
towards
health
be
rapid
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
every
reason
,
but
one
,
in
favour
of
her
speedy
removal
home
.
 
<EOS>
all
Jem
's
duty
lie
in
Manchester
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
his
mother
's
dwelling
-
place
,
and
there
his
plan
for
life
have
be
to
be
work
out
;
<EOS>
plan
which
the
suspicion
and
imprisonment
he
have
fall
into
,
have
throw
for
a
time
into
a
chaos
,
which
his
presence
be
require
to
arrange
into
form
.
 
<EOS>
for
he
may
find
,
in
spite
of
a
jury
's
verdict
,
that
too
strong
a
taint
be
on
his
character
for
him
ever
to
labour
in
Manchester
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
remember
the
manner
in
which
some
one
suspect
of
have
be
a
convict
be
shun
by
master
and
man
,
when
he
have
accidentally
meet
with
work
in
their
foundry
;
the
recollection
smite
him
now
,
how
he
himself
have
think
it
do
not
become
an
honest
upright
man
to
associate
with
one
who
have
be
a
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
choose
but
think
on
that
poor
humble
be
,
with
his
downcast
conscious
look
;
hunt
out
of
the
workshop
,
where
he
have
seek
to
earn
an
honest
livelihood
,
by
the
look
,
and
half
-
spoken
word
,
and
the
black
silence
of
repugnance
(
bad
than
word
to
bear
)
,
that
meet
him
on
all
side
.
  
<EOS>
Jem
feel
that
his
own
character
have
be
attaint
;
and
that
to
many
it
may
still
appear
suspicious
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
that
he
could
convince
the
world
,
by
a
future
as
blameless
as
his
past
have
be
,
that
he
be
innocent
.
 
<EOS>
but
at
the
same
time
he
see
that
he
must
have
patience
,
and
nerve
himself
for
some
trial
;
and
the
sooner
these
be
undergo
<EOS>
,
the
sooner
he
be
aware
of
the
place
he
hold
in
man
's
estimation
,
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
long
to
have
present
himself
once
more
at
the
foundry
;
and
then
the
reality
would
drive
away
the
picture
that
would
(
unbidden
)
come
of
a
shunned
man
,
eyed
askance
by
all
,
and
drive
forth
to
shape
out
some
new
career
.
  
<EOS>
I
say
every
reason
"
but
one
"
incline
Jem
to
hasten
Mary
's
return
as
soon
as
she
be
sufficiently
convalescent
.
 
<EOS>
that
one
be
the
meeting
which
await
her
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
turn
it
over
as
Jem
would
,
he
could
not
decide
what
be
the
good
course
to
pursue
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
compel
himself
to
any
line
of
conduct
that
his
reason
and
his
sense
of
right
tell
him
to
be
desirable
;
but
they
do
not
tell
him
it
be
desirable
to
speak
to
Mary
,
in
her
tender
state
of
mind
and
body
,
of
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
how
much
would
be
imply
by
the
mere
mention
of
his
name
!
 
<EOS>
speak
it
as
calmly
,
and
as
indifferently
as
he
may
,
he
could
not
avoid
express
some
consciousness
of
the
terrible
knowledge
she
possess
.
  
<EOS>
She
,
for
her
part
,
be
soft
and
gentle
than
she
have
even
be
in
her
gentle
mood
;
since
her
illness
,
her
motion
,
her
glance
,
her
voice
be
all
tender
in
their
languor
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
almost
a
trouble
to
her
to
break
the
silence
with
the
low
sound
of
her
own
sweet
voice
,
and
her
word
fall
sparingly
on
Jem
's
greedy
,
listen
ear
.
  
<EOS>
Her
face
be
,
however
,
so
full
of
love
and
confidence
,
that
Jem
feel
no
uneasiness
at
the
state
of
silent
abstraction
into
which
she
often
fall
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
do
but
love
him
,
all
would
yet
go
right
;
and
it
be
well
not
to
press
for
confidence
on
that
one
subject
which
must
be
painful
to
both
.
  
<EOS>
there
come
a
fine
,
bright
,
balmy
day
.
 
<EOS>
and
Mary
totter
once
more
out
into
the
open
air
,
lean
on
Jem
's
arm
,
and
close
to
his
beat
heart
.
 
<EOS>
and
Mrs.
Sturgis
watch
them
from
her
door
,
with
a
blessing
on
her
lip
,
as
they
go
slowly
up
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
They
come
in
sight
of
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
shudder
.
  
<EOS>
"
o
Jem
!
<EOS>
take
me
home
.
 
<EOS>
Yon
river
seem
all
make
of
glitter
,
heave
,
dazzle
metal
,
just
as
it
do
when
I
begin
to
be
ill
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jem
lead
her
homeward
.
 
<EOS>
She
drop
her
head
as
search
for
something
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jem
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
be
all
attention
.
 
<EOS>
She
pause
for
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
"
when
may
I
go
home
?
 
<EOS>
to
Manchester
<EOS>
,
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
so
weary
of
this
place
;
and
I
would
fain
be
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
speak
in
a
feeble
voice
;
not
at
all
impatiently
,
as
the
word
themselves
would
seem
to
intimate
,
but
in
a
mournful
way
,
as
if
anticipate
sorrow
even
in
the
very
fulfilment
of
her
wish
.
  
<EOS>
"
darling
!
<EOS>
we
will
go
whenever
you
wish
;
whenever
you
feel
strong
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
Job
to
tell
Margaret
to
get
all
in
readiness
for
you
to
go
there
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
tend
you
and
nurse
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
go
home
.
 
<EOS>
Job
proffer
for
you
to
go
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
but
I
must
go
home
,
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
try
and
not
fail
now
in
what
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
thing
we
must
not
speak
on
"
(
lower
her
voice
)
,
"
but
you
will
be
really
kind
if
you
will
not
speak
against
my
go
home
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
,
dear
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
go
home
,
and
I
must
go
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
not
alone
,
Mary
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
alone
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
you
why
I
ask
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
you
guess
,
I
know
you
well
enough
to
be
sure
you
will
understand
why
I
ask
you
never
to
speak
on
that
again
to
me
,
till
I
begin
.
 
<EOS>
Promise
,
dear
Jem
,
promise
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
promise
;
to
gratify
that
beseech
face
,
he
promise
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
repent
,
and
feel
as
if
he
have
do
ill
.
 
<EOS>
then
again
he
feel
as
if
she
be
the
good
judge
,
and
know
all
(
perhaps
more
than
even
he
do
)
,
may
be
form
plan
which
his
interference
would
mar
.
  
<EOS>
one
thing
be
certain
!
<EOS>
it
be
a
miserable
thing
to
have
this
awful
forbidden
ground
of
discourse
;
to
guess
at
each
other
's
thought
,
when
eye
be
avert
,
and
cheek
blanch
,
and
word
stand
still
,
arrest
in
their
flow
by
some
casual
allusion
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
a
day
,
fine
enough
for
Mary
to
travel
on
,
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
wish
to
go
,
but
now
her
courage
fail
her
.
 
<EOS>
how
could
she
have
say
she
be
weary
of
that
quiet
house
,
where
even
Ben
Sturgis
's
grumbling
only
make
a
kind
of
harmonious
bass
in
the
concord
between
him
and
his
wife
,
so
thoroughly
do
they
know
each
other
with
the
knowledge
of
many
year
!
 
<EOS>
how
could
she
have
long
to
quit
that
little
peaceful
room
where
she
have
experience
such
loving
tendence
!
 
<EOS>
even
the
very
check
bed
-
curtain
become
dear
to
her
under
the
idea
of
see
them
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
be
so
with
inanimate
object
,
if
they
have
such
power
of
exciting
regret
,
what
be
her
feeling
with
regard
to
the
kind
old
couple
,
who
have
take
the
stranger
in
,
and
care
for
her
,
and
nurse
her
,
as
though
she
have
be
a
daughter
?
 
<EOS>
each
wilful
sentence
speak
in
the
half
-
unconscious
irritation
of
feebleness
come
now
with
avenge
self
-
reproach
to
her
memory
,
as
she
hang
about
Mrs.
Sturgis
,
with
many
tear
,
which
serve
instead
of
word
to
express
her
gratitude
and
love
.
  
<EOS>
Ben
bustle
about
with
the
square
bottle
of
Goldenwasser
in
one
of
his
hand
,
and
a
small
tumbler
in
the
other
;
he
go
to
Mary
,
Jem
,
and
his
wife
in
succession
,
pour
out
a
glass
for
each
,
and
bid
them
drink
it
to
keep
their
spirit
up
;
but
as
each
severally
refuse
,
he
drink
it
himself
;
and
pass
on
to
offer
the
same
hospitality
to
another
,
with
the
like
refusal
,
and
the
like
result
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
swallow
the
last
of
the
three
draught
,
he
condescend
to
give
his
reason
for
have
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
abide
waste
.
 
<EOS>
what
be
pour
out
mun
be
drunk
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
my
maxim
.
"
 
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
replace
the
bottle
in
the
cupboard
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
he
who
,
in
a
firm
commanding
voice
,
at
last
tell
Jem
and
Mary
to
be
off
,
or
they
would
be
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Sturgis
have
keep
up
till
then
;
but
as
they
leave
her
house
,
she
could
no
longer
restrain
her
tear
,
and
cry
aloud
in
spite
of
her
husband
's
upbraiding
.
  
<EOS>
"
perhaps
they
will
be
too
late
for
the
train
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
she
,
with
a
degree
of
hope
,
as
the
clock
strike
two
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
and
come
back
again
!
 
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
that
would
never
do
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
do
our
part
,
and
cry
our
cry
;
it
be
no
use
go
over
the
same
ground
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
ha
'
to
give
'em
more
out
of
yon
bottle
when
next
parting
time
come
,
and
them
three
glass
they
ha
'
make
a
hole
in
the
stuff
,
I
can
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
Time
Jack
be
back
from
Hamburg
with
some
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
they
reach
Manchester
,
Mary
look
very
white
,
and
the
expression
of
her
face
be
almost
stern
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
in
fact
summon
up
her
resolution
to
meet
her
father
if
he
be
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
have
never
name
his
midnight
glimpse
of
John
Barton
to
human
being
:
but
Mary
have
a
sort
of
presentiment
,
that
wander
where
he
would
,
he
would
seek
his
home
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
what
mood
she
dread
to
think
.
<EOS>
for
the
knowledge
of
her
father
's
capability
of
guilt
seem
to
have
open
a
dark
gulf
in
his
character
,
into
the
depth
of
which
she
tremble
to
look
.
 
<EOS>
at
one
moment
she
would
fain
have
claim
protection
against
the
life
she
must
lead
,
for
some
time
at
least
,
alone
with
a
murderer
!
 
<EOS>
She
think
of
his
gloom
,
before
his
mind
be
haunt
by
the
memory
of
so
terrible
a
crime
;
his
moody
,
irritable
way
.
 
<EOS>
She
imagine
the
evening
as
of
old
;
she
,
toil
at
some
work
,
long
after
house
be
shut
,
and
folk
abe
;
<EOS>
he
,
more
savage
than
he
have
ever
be
before
with
the
inward
gnawing
of
his
remorse
.
 
<EOS>
at
such
time
she
could
have
cry
aloud
with
terror
,
at
the
scene
her
fancy
conjure
up
.
  
<EOS>
but
her
filial
duty
,
nay
,
her
love
and
gratitude
for
many
deed
of
kindness
do
to
her
as
a
little
child
,
conquer
all
fear
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
endure
all
imaginable
terror
,
although
of
daily
occurrence
.
<EOS>
and
she
would
patiently
bear
all
wayward
violence
of
temper
;
more
than
patiently
would
she
bear
it
 
pitifully
,
as
one
who
know
of
some
awful
curse
await
the
blood
-
shedder
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
watch
over
him
tenderly
,
as
the
innocent
should
watch
over
the
guilty
;
await
the
gracious
season
,
wherein
to
pour
oil
and
balm
into
the
bitter
wound
.
  
<EOS>
with
the
untroubled
peace
which
the
resolve
to
endure
to
the
end
give
,
she
approach
the
house
that
from
habit
she
still
call
home
,
but
which
possess
the
holiness
of
home
no
longer

<EOS>
"
Jem
!

say
she
,
as
they
stand
at
the
entrance
to
the
court
,
close
by
Job
Legh
's
door
,
"
you
must
go
in
there

half

an

She
sigh
heavily

<EOS>
"
Mary

Mary

be
to
be
nought
to
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
and
my
heart
's
bind
up
in
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
why
you
bid
me
keep
away
,
but
"
    
She
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
,
as
he
speak
in
a
loud
agitated
tone
;
she
look
into
his
face
with
upbraid
love
in
her
eye
,
and
then
she
say
,
while
her
lip
quiver
,
and
he
feel
her
whole
frame
tremble
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Jem
!
 
<EOS>
I
often
could
have
tell
you
more
of
love
,
if
I
have
not
once
speak
out
so
free
.
 
<EOS>
remember
that
time
,
Jem
,
if
ever
you
think
me
cold
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
the
love
that
be
in
my
heart
would
out
in
word
;
but
now
,
though
I
be
silent
on
the
pain
I
be
feel
in
quit
you
,
the
love
be
in
my
heart
all
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
the
time
to
speak
on
such
thing
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
do
not
do
what
I
feel
to
be
right
now
,
I
may
blame
myself
all
my
life
long
!
 
<EOS>
Jem
,
you
promise
"
    
<EOS>
and
so
say
she
leave
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
go
quicker
than
she
would
otherwise
have
pass
over
those
few
yard
of
ground
,
<EOS>
for
fear
he
should
still
try
to
accompany
her
.
 
<EOS>
Her
hand
be
on
the
latch
,
and
in
a
breath
the
door
be
open
.
  
<EOS>
there
sit
her
father
,
still
and
motionless
 
not
even
turn
his
head
to
see
who
have
enter
;
but
perhaps
he
recognise
the
footstep
 
the
trick
of
action
.
  
<EOS>
He
sit
by
the
fire
;
the
grate
,
I
should
say
,
for
fire
there
be
none
.
 
<EOS>
some
dull
grey
ashe
,
negligently
leave
,
long
day
ago
,
coldly
choke
up
the
bar
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
take
the
accustomed
seat
from
mere
force
of
habit
,
which
rule
his
automaton
body
.
 
<EOS>
for
all
energy
,
both
physical
and
mental
,
seem
to
have
retreat
inward
to
some
of
the
great
citadel
of
life
,
there
to
do
battle
against
the
Destroyer
,
Conscience
.
  
<EOS>
His
hand
be
cross
,
his
finger
interlace
;
usually
a
position
imply
some
degree
of
resolution
,
or
strength
;
but
in
him
it
be
so
faintly
maintain
,
that
it
appear
more
the
result
of
chance
;
<EOS>
an
attitude
require
some
application
of
outward
force
to
alter
 
and
a
blow
with
a
straw
seem
as
though
it
would
be
sufficient
.
  
<EOS>
and
as
for
his
face
,
it
be
sink
and
wear
 
like
a
skull
,
with
yet
a
suffer
expression
that
skull
have
not
!
 
<EOS>
Your
heart
would
have
ache
to
have
see
the
man
,
however
hardly
you
may
have
judge
his
crime
.
  
<EOS>
but
crime
and
all
be
forget
by
his
daughter
,
as
she
see
his
abashed
look
,
his
smitten
helplessness
.
 
<EOS>
all
along
she
have
feel
it
difficult
(
as
I
may
have
say
before
)
to
reconcile
the
two
idea
,
of
her
father
and
a
blood
-
shedder
.
 
<EOS>
but
now
it
be
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
her
father
!
<EOS>
her
own
dear
father
!
<EOS>
and
in
his
suffering
,
whatever
their
cause
,
more
dearly
love
than
ever
before
.
 
<EOS>
His
crime
be
a
thing
apart
,
never
more
to
be
consider
by
her
.
  
<EOS>
and
tenderly
do
she
treat
him
,
and
fondly
do
she
serve
him
in
every
way
that
heart
could
devise
,
or
hand
execute
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
some
money
about
her
,
the
price
of
her
strange
service
as
a
witness
;
and
when
the
linger
dusk
grow
on
she
steal
out
to
effect
some
purchase
necessary
for
her
father
's
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
for
how
body
and
soul
have
be
keep
together
,
even
as
much
as
they
be
,
during
the
day
he
have
dwell
alone
,
no
one
can
say
.
 
<EOS>
the
house
be
bare
as
when
Mary
have
leave
it
,
of
coal
,
or
of
candle
,
of
food
,
or
of
blessing
in
any
shape
.
  
<EOS>
She
come
quickly
home
;
but
as
she
pass
Job
Legh
's
door
,
she
stop
.
 
<EOS>
Doubtless
Jem
have
long
since
go
;
and
doubtless
,
<EOS>
too
,
he
have
give
Margaret
some
good
reason
for
not
intrude
upon
her
friend
for
this
night
at
least
,
otherwise
Mary
would
have
see
her
before
now
.
  
<EOS>
but
to
-
morrow
,
 
would
she
not
come
in
to
-
morrow
?
 
<EOS>
and
who
so
quick
as
blind
Margaret
in
notice
tone
,
and
sigh
,
and
even
silence
?
  
<EOS>
She
do
not
give
herself
time
for
further
thought
,
her
desire
to
be
once
more
with
her
father
be
too
pressing
;
but
she
open
the
door
,
before
she
well
know
what
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
Mary
Barton
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
her
by
her
breathing
!
 
<EOS>
Grandfather
,
it
be
Mary
Barton
!
"
  
<EOS>
Margaret
's
joy
at
meet
her
,
the
open
demonstration
of
her
love
,
affect
Mary
much
;
she
could
not
keep
from
cry
,
and
sit
down
weak
and
agitated
on
the
first
chair
she
could
find
.
  
<EOS>
"
ay
,
ay
,
Mary
!
<EOS>
thou'rt
<EOS>
look
a
bit
different
to
when
I
see
thee
last
.
 
<EOS>
Thou'lt
give
Jem
and
me
good
character
for
sick
nurse
,
I
trust
.
 
<EOS>
if
all
trade
fail
,
I
will
turn
to
that
.
 
<EOS>
Jem
's
place
be
for
life
,
I
reckon
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
never
redden
so
,
lass
.
 
<EOS>
You
and
<EOS>
he
know
each
other
's
mind
by
this
time
!
"
  
<EOS>
Margaret
hold
her
hand
,
and
gently
smile
into
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
Job
Legh
take
the
candle
up
,
and
begin
a
leisurely
inspection
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thou
hast
get
a
bit
of
pink
in
thy
cheek
,
 
not
much
;
but
when
last
I
see
thee
,
thy
lip
be
as
white
as
a
sheet
.
 
<EOS>
Thy
nose
be
sharpish
at
th
'
end
;
thou'rt
more
like
thy
father
than
ever
thou
wert
before
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
child
,
what
be
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
art
thou
go
to
faint
?
"
  
<EOS>
for
Mary
have
sicken
at
the
mention
of
that
name
;
yet
she
feel
that
now
or
never
be
the
time
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
's
come
home
!
"
<EOS>
she
say
,
"
but
he
be
very
poorly
;
I
never
see
him
as
he
be
now
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
Jem
not
to
come
near
him
for
fear
it
may
fidget
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
speak
hastily
,
and
(
to
her
own
idea
)
in
an
unnatural
manner
.
<EOS>
but
they
do
not
seem
to
notice
it
,
nor
to
take
the
hint
she
have
throw
out
of
company
be
unacceptable
;
for
Job
Legh
directly
put
down
some
insect
,
which
he
be
impale
on
a
cork
-
pin
,
and
exclaim
   
"
thy
father
come
home
!
 
<EOS>
why
,
Jem
never
say
a
word
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
and
ail
too
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
in
,
and
cheer
him
with
a
bit
of
talk
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
know
any
good
come
of
delegate
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
O
Job
!
<EOS>
father
can
not
stand
 
father
be
too
ill
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
come
;
not
but
that
you
be
very
kind
and
good
;
but
to
-
night
 
indeed
,
"
say
she
at
last
,
in
despair
,
see
Job
still
persevere
in
put
away
his
thing
;
"
you
must
not
come
till
I
send
or
come
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
Father
's
in
that
strange
way
,
I
can
not
answer
for
it
if
he
see
stranger
.
<EOS>
please
do
not
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
come
and
tell
you
every
day
how
he
go
on
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
off
now
to
see
after
him
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
Job
!
<EOS>
kind
Job
!
<EOS>
do
not
be
angry
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
know
all
,
you
would
pity
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
for
Job
be
mutter
away
in
high
dudgeon
,
and
even
Margaret
's
tone
be
alter
as
she
wish
Mary
good
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
just
then
she
could
ill
brook
coldness
from
any
one
,
and
least
of
all
bear
the
idea
of
be
consider
ungrateful
by
so
kind
and
zealous
<EOS>
a
friend
as
Job
have
be
<EOS>
;
so
she
turn
round
suddenly
,
even
when
her
hand
be
on
the
latch
of
the
door
,
and
run
back
,
and
throw
her
arm
about
his
neck
,
and
kiss
him
first
,
and
then
Margaret
.
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
the
tear
fast
fall
down
her
cheek
,
but
no
word
speak
,
she
hastily
leave
the
house
,
and
go
back
to
her
home
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
change
in
her
father
's
position
,
or
in
his
spectral
look
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
answer
her
question
(
but
few
in
number
,
for
so
many
subject
be
unapproachable
)
by
monosyllable
,
and
in
a
weak
,
high
,
childish
voice
;
but
he
have
not
lift
his
eye
;
he
could
not
meet
his
daughter
's
look
.
 
<EOS>
and
she
,
when
she
speak
,
or
as
she
move
about
,
avoid
let
her
eye
rest
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
wish
to
be
her
usual
self
;
but
while
everything
be
do
with
a
consciousness
of
purpose
,
she
feel
it
be
impossible
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
manner
thing
go
on
for
some
day
.
 
<EOS>
at
night
he
feebly
clamber
upstairs
to
bed
;
and
during
those
long
dark
hour
Mary
hear
those
groan
of
agony
which
never
escape
his
lip
by
day
,
when
they
be
compress
in
silence
over
his
inward
woe
.
  
<EOS>
many
a
time
she
sit
up
listen
,
and
wonder
if
it
would
ease
his
miserable
heart
if
she
go
to
him
,
and
tell
him
she
know
all
,
and
love
and
pity
him
more
than
word
could
tell
.
  
<EOS>
by
day
the
monotonous
hour
wear
on
in
the
same
heavy
,
hushed
manner
as
on
that
first
dreary
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
He
eat
,
 
but
without
that
relish
;
and
food
seem
no
longer
to
nourish
him
,
for
each
morning
his
face
have
catch
more
of
the
ghastly
foreshadowing
of
death
.
  
<EOS>
the
neighbour
keep
strangely
aloof
.
 
<EOS>
of
late
year
John
Barton
have
have
a
repellent
power
about
him
,
feel
by
all
,
except
to
the
few
who
have
either
know
him
in
his
well
and
happy
day
,
or
those
to
whom
he
have
give
his
sympathy
and
his
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
People
do
not
care
to
enter
the
door
of
one
whose
very
depth
of
thoughtfulness
render
him
moody
and
stern
.
 
<EOS>
and
now
they
content
themselves
with
a
kind
inquiry
when
they
see
Mary
in
her
going
-
out
or
in
her
coming
-
in
.
 
<EOS>
with
her
oppress
knowledge
,
she
imagine
their
reserved
conduct
stranger
than
it
be
in
reality
.
 
<EOS>
She
miss
Job
and
Margaret
too
;
<EOS>
who
,
in
all
former
time
of
sorrow
or
anxiety
since
their
acquaintance
first
begin
,
have
be
ready
with
their
sympathy
.
  
<EOS>
but
most
of
all
she
miss
the
delicious
luxury
she
have
lately
enjoy
in
have
Jem
's
tender
love
at
hand
every
hour
of
the
day
,
to
ward
off
every
wind
of
heaven
,
and
every
disturbing
thought
.
  
<EOS>
She
know
he
be
often
hover
about
the
house
;
though
the
knowledge
seem
to
come
more
by
intuition
,
than
by
any
positive
sight
or
sound
for
the
first
day
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
third
day
she
meet
him
at
Job
Legh
's
.
  
<EOS>
They
receive
her
with
every
effort
of
cordiality
;
but
still
there
be
a
cobweb
-
veil
of
separation
between
them
,
to
which
Mary
be
morbidly
acute
;
while
in
Jem
's
voice
,
and
eye
,
and
manner
,
there
be
every
evidence
of
most
passionate
,
most
admiring
,
and
most
trust
love
.
 
<EOS>
the
trust
be
show
by
his
respectful
silence
on
that
one
point
of
reserve
on
which
she
have
interdict
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
He
leave
Job
Legh
's
house
when
she
do
.
 
<EOS>
They
linger
on
the
step
,
he
hold
her
hand
between
both
of
his
,
as
loth
to
let
her
go
;
he
question
her
as
to
when
he
should
see
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
mother
do
so
want
to
see
you
,
"
whisper
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
come
to
see
her
to
-
morrow
;
or
when
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
,
"
reply
she
softly
.
 
<EOS>
"
not
yet
.
 
<EOS>
wait
awhile
;
<EOS>
perhaps
only
a
little
while
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
Jem
,
I
must
go
to
him
,
 
dearest
Jem
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
,
the
fourth
from
Mary
's
return
home
,
as
she
be
sit
near
the
window
,
sadly
dream
over
some
work
,
she
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
last
person
she
wish
to
see
 
of
Sally
Leadbitter
!
  
<EOS>
She
be
evidently
come
to
their
house
;
another
moment
,
and
she
tap
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
John
Barton
give
an
anxious
,
uneasy
side
-
glance
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
know
that
if
she
delay
answer
the
knock
,
Sally
would
not
scruple
to
enter
;
so
as
hastily
as
if
the
visit
have
be
desire
,
she
open
the
door
,
and
stand
there
with
the
latch
in
her
hand
,
bar
up
all
entrance
,
and
as
much
as
possible
obstruct
all
curious
glance
into
the
interior
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
Mary
Barton
!
 
<EOS>
You
be
home
at
last
!
 
<EOS>
I
hear
you
would
getten
home
;
so
I
think
I
would
just
step
over
and
hear
the
news
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
be
bent
on
come
in
,
and
see
Mary
's
preventive
design
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
stand
on
tiptoe
,
look
over
Mary
's
shoulder
into
the
room
where
she
suspect
a
lover
to
be
lurk
;
but
instead
,
she
see
only
the
figure
of
the
stern
,
gloomy
father
<EOS>
she
have
always
be
in
the
habit
of
avoid
;
and
she
drop
down
again
,
content
to
carry
on
the
conversation
where
Mary
choose
,
and
as
Mary
choose
,
in
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"

You

<EOS>
Mary
give
a
low
moan
 
and
then
implore
Sally
to
change
the
subject
;
for
unpleasant
as
it
always
be
,
it
be
doubly
unpleasant
in
the
manner
in
which
she
be
treat
it
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
have
be
alone
<EOS>
Mary
would
have
bear
it
patiently
 
<EOS>
or
she
think
,
<EOS>
but
now
she
feel
almost
certain
,
her
father
be
listen
;
there
be
a
subdued
breathing
,
a
slight
bracing
-
up
of
the
listless
attitude

<EOS>
but
there
be
no
arrest
Sally
's
curiosity
to
hear
all
she
could
respect
the
adventure
Mary

experience

<EOS>
She
,
in

with
the
rest
of
Miss
Simmonds

young
lady

be
almost
jealous
of
the
fame
that
Mary
have
obtain
;
to
herself
,
such
miserable
notoriety
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
!
<EOS>
there

no

talk
it
over

<EOS>
why
!
<EOS>
it
be
in
the
Guardian
 
and
the
Courier
 
and
some
one
tell
Jane
Hodgson
it
be
even
copy
into
a
London
paper
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
set
up
heroine

the
truth

I
never

Sally

how

ask
she
reproachfully

"

<EOS>
You

all

<EOS>
Cast
down
as
Mary
be
,
she
could
hardly
keep
from
smile
at
the
idea
,
so
wildly
incongruous
with
the
scene
she
have
really
undergo

of
look
out
for
admirer
during
a

for
murder

<EOS>

You

"
do
not

<EOS>
I
suppose
I
must
not

it
,
see
you
go
to
such
trouble
to
get
up
an
alibi

not
that
I

how
good

with

about

about

oh

I
do

know
more

he

turn
away
from

because
folk
do
not

clear
him
outright
of

the

hang
him

Old

all

<EOS>
"
I

so
I

Mary
shut

Her

unchanging
attitude

only
his

bow

She
put

but
his
head
be
droop
so
low
she
could
not
hear
what
he

so
she
stoop
down
;

after
a
moment

pause
,
he
repeat
the

<EOS>
Could

<EOS>
They

SOUTHEY

<EOS>
as

turn
into

street
where

Wilsons

<EOS>
He
come
upon
her
suddenly
,
and
she
start

<EOS>
"
You

he
ask
tenderly

yes

She
feel
rightly

guess
the

her
only
half
-
express
inquiry

He
hesitate
a
moment
before
he
answer
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
darling
,
it
be
;
it
be
no
use
hide
it
 
if
you
mean
that
I
be
no
long
to
work
at
Duncombe
's
foundry

<EOS>
It
be
no
time
(
to
my
mind
)
to
have
secret
from
each
other
,
though
I
do
not
name
it
yesterday

think
you
may
fret

<EOS>
I
shall
soon
get
work
again

never
fear

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
why
do
they
turn
you
off
,
when
the
jury
have
say
you
be
innocent
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
just
to
say
turn
off
,
though
I
do
not
think
I
could
have
well
stay
on
.
 
<EOS>
a
good
number
of
the
man
manage
to
let
out
they
should
not
like
to
work
under
me
again
;
there
be
some
few
who
know
me
well
enough
to
feel
I
could
not
have
do
it
,
but
more
be
doubtful
;
and
one
speak
to
young
Mr.
Duncombe
,
hint
at
what
they
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
o
Jem
!
<EOS>
what
a
shame
!
<EOS>
"
say
Mary
,
with
mournful
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
darling
!
<EOS>
I
be
not
for
blame
them
.
 
<EOS>
poor
fellow
like
them
have
nought
to
stand
upon
and
be
proud
of
but
their
character
,
and
it
be
fitting
they
should
take
care
of
that
,

keep
that
free
from
soil
and
taint

"
  
<EOS>

you
 
what

good
from
you

know
you
by

so
some
do

the
overlook
,
<EOS>
I
be

,
would
know
I
be
innocent

<EOS>
indeed
,
he
say
as
much
to

day
;

he
say
he
have
have
some
talk
with
old
Mr.
Duncombe
,
and
they
think
it
may
be
well
if
I
leave
Manchester
for
a
bit
;
they
would
recommend
me
to
some
other
place

<EOS>

Mary
could
only
shake
her
head
in
a
mournful
way
,
and
repeat
her
word

"
They
may
have
know
thee
better

<EOS>
Jem
press
the
little
hand
he
hold
between
his
own
work
-
harden
one
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
minute
or
two
,
he
ask
   
"
Mary
,
art
thou
much
bind
to
Manchester

Would
it
grieve
thee
sore

in

glancing

<EOS>
trust
me

I
will
never
ask
thee
to
leave
Manchester

fine

Thou

not
rightly
 
not
now

at
any
rate

with
thee
,
Jem

"
her
voice
sink
to
a
soft
,
low
whisper
,
"
anywhere

what
be
the
use
of
a
geographical
description
?
  
<EOS>
"
but
father
!

"
say
Mary
,
suddenly
break
that
delicious
silence
with
the
one
sharp
discord
in
her
present
life

<EOS>
She
look
up
at
her
lover
's
grave
face
;
and
then
the
message
her
father
have
send
flash
across
her
memory
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
Jem
,
do
I
tell
you
?
 
<EOS>
Father
send
word

wish
to
speak
with
you

<EOS>
I
be
to
bid
you

eight

"
at

I
will
go

It
be
no
use

he
continue
,
after
a
pause
for
a
few
minute
,
during
which
they
slowly
and
silently
pace
up
and
down
the
by
-
street
,
into
which
he
have
lead
her
when
their
conversation
begin
.
<EOS>
"
come

then
I
will
take
thee
home

<EOS>
Thou
wert
all
in
a
tremble

when
first
I
come
up
to
thee

thou'rt
not
fit
to
be
trust
home

say
he
,
with
fond
exaggeration
of
her
helplessness
.
  
<EOS>
yet
a
little
more
lover
'
loitering
!
<EOS>
a
few
more
word
,
in
themselves
nothing
 
to
you
nothing
 
but
to
those
two
,
what
tender
passionate
language
can
I
use
to
express
the
feeling
which
thrill
through
that
young
man
and
maiden
,
as
they
listen
to
the
syllable
make
dear
and
lovely
through
life
by
that
hour
's
low

whispered
talk

<EOS>
It
strike
the
half

hour
past
seven

come
and
speak

they
go
in

<EOS>
Jane
Wilson
be
rather
chafed
at
her
son
's
delay
in
return
home
,
for
as
yet
he
have
manage
to
keep
her
in
ignorance
of
his
dismissal
from
the
foundry
;
and
it
be
her
way
to
prepare
some
little
pleasure
,
some
little
comfort
for
those
she
love
;
and
if
they
,
unwittingly
,
do
not
appear
at
the
proper
time
to
enjoy
her
preparation
,
she
work
herself
up
into
a
state
of
fretfulness
which
find
vent
in
upbraiding
as
soon
as
ever
the
object
of
her
care
appear
,
thereby
mar
the
peace
which
should
ever
be
the
atmosphere
of
a
home
,
however
humble
;
and
cause
a
feeling
almost
amount
to
loathe
to
arise
at
the
sight
of
the
"
stall
ox
,
"
which
,
though
an
effect
and
proof
of
careful
love
,
have
be
the
cause
of
so
much
disturbance

<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilson
at
first
sigh
,
and
then
grumble
to
herself
,
over
the
increase
toughness
of
the
potato

cake
she
have
make
for
her
son
's
tea

<EOS>
the
door
open

and
he
come
in
;
his
face
brighten
into
proud
smile
,
Mary
Barton
hang
on
his
arm
,
blush
and
dimpling
,
with
eyelid
veil
the
happy
light

her
eye
 
<EOS>
there
be
around
the
young
couple
a
radiant
atmosphere
 
a
glory

Could

Could

her

she
open
her

and
receive
Mary
into
them

as
shed
tear
of
agitated
joy

in

ear

It
take
some
of
Jem

self

command
to
separate
those
whom
he
so
much
love
,

who
be
begin
,
for
his

,
to
love
one
another
so
dearly

<EOS>
but
the
time
for
his
meeting
John
Barton
draw
on
:
and
it
be
a
long
way
to
his
house
.
  
<EOS>
as
they
walk
briskly
thither
they
hardly
speak
;
though
many
thought
be
in
their
mind
.
  
<EOS>
the
sun
have
not
long
set
,
but
the
first
faint
shade
of
twilight
be
over
all
;
and
when
they
open
the
door
,
Jem
could
hardly
perceive
the
object
within
by
the
waning
light
of
day
,
and
the
flicker
fire
-
blaze
.
  
<EOS>
but
Mary
see
all
at
a
glance
.
  
<EOS>
Her
eye
,
accustom
to
what
be
usual
in
the
aspect
of
the
room
,
see
instantly
what
be
unusual
,
 
see
and
understand
it
all
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
be
stand
behind
his
habitual
chair
;
hold
by
the
back
of
it
as
if
for
support
.
 
<EOS>
and
opposite
to
him
there
stand
Mr.
Carson
;
the
dark
outline
of
his
stern
figure
loom
large
against
the
light
of
the
fire
in
that
little
room
.
  
<EOS>
behind
her
father
sit
Job
Legh
,
his
head
in
his
hand
,
and
rest
his
elbow
on
the
little
family
table
,
listen
evidently
;
but
as
evidently
deeply
affect
by
what
he
hear
.
  
<EOS>
there
seem
to
be
some
pause
in
the
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
and
Jem
stand
at
the
half
-
open
door
,
not
daring
to
stir
;
hardly
to
breathe
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
have
I
hear
you
aright
?
"
begin
Mr.
Carson
,
with
his
deep
quivering
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Man

<EOS>
(
he
say
these
last
few
word
almost
as
if
appeal
for
pity
,
and
then
he
change
his
tone
to
one
more
vehement
and
fierce
)
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
not
dare
to
think
that
I
shall
be
merciful

spare
you

you
have
come
forward

accuse
yourself

I
tell
you
I

he

advance
his
face
,

repeat
the
word

slow

grind
emphasis

as
if
to
infuse
some
of
the
bitterness

his
soul
into
it

John

gasp
,

not
with
fear

It

of
all
earthly
thing
,
they
bear
him
to
his
bed
.
  
<EOS>
for
a
time
they
listen
with
divided
attention
to
his
faint
breathing
;
for
in
each
hasty
hurry
step
that
echo
in
the
street
outside
,
they
think
they
hear
the
approach
of
the
officer
of
justice
.
  
<EOS>
when
Mr.
Carson
leave
the
house
he
be
dizzy
with
agitation
;
the
hot
blood
go
career
through
his
frame
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
see
the
deep
blue
of
the
night
-
heaven
for
the
fierce
pulse
which
throb
in
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
and
partly
to
steady
and
calm
himself
,
he
lean
against
a
railing
,
and
look
up
into
those
calm
majestic
depth
with
all
their
thousand
star
.
  
<EOS>
and
by
-
and
-
by
his
own
voice
return
upon
him
,
as
if
the
last
word
he
have
speak
be
be
utter
through
all
that
infinite
space
;
but
in
their
echo
there
be
a
tone
of
unutterable
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
"
let
my
trespass
be
unforgiven
,
so
that
I
may
have
vengeance
for
my
son
's
murder
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
try
to
shake
off
the
spiritual
impression
make
by
this
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
feverish
and
ill
,
 
and
no
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
so
he
turn
to
go
homeward
;
not
,
as
he
have
threaten
,
to
the
police
-
office
.
 
<EOS>
after
all
(
he
tell
himself
)
,
that
would
do
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
no
fear
of
the
man
's
escaping
,
unless
he
escape
to
the
grave
.
  
<EOS>
so
he
try
to
banish
the
phantom
voice
and
shape
which
come
unbidden
to
his
brain
,
and
to
recall
his
balance
of
mind
by
walk
calmly
and
slowly
,
and
notice
everything
which
strike
his
sense
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
warm
soft
evening
in
spring
,
and
there
be
many
person
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
among
other
a
nurse
with
a
little
girl
in
her
charge
,
convey
her
home
from
some
child
's
gaiety
;
a
dance
most
likely
,
for
the
lovely
little
creature
be
daintily
deck
out
in
soft
,
snowy
muslin
;
and
her
fairy
foot
trip
along
by
her
nurse
's
side
as
if
to
the
measure
of
some
tune
she
have
lately
keep
time
to
.
  
<EOS>
suddenly
up
behind
her
there
come
a
rough
,
rude
errand
-
boy
,
nine
or
ten
year
of
age
;
a
giant
he
look
by
the
fairy
-
child
,
as
she
flutter
along
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
it
be
,
but
in
some
awkward
way
he
knock
the
poor
little
girl
down
upon
the
hard
pavement
as
he
brush
rudely
past
,
not
much
care
whom
he
hurt
,
so
that
he
get
along
.
  
<EOS>
the
child
arise
,
sob
with
pain
;
and
not
without
cause
,
for
blood
be
drop
down
from
the
face
,
but
a
minute
before
so
fair
and
bright
 
drop
down
on
the
pretty
frock
,
make
those
scarlet
mark
so
terrible
to
little
child
.
  
<EOS>
the
nurse
,
a
powerful
woman
,
have
seize
the
boy
,
just
as
Mr.
Carson
(
who
have
see
the
whole
transaction
)
come
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
naughty
little
rascal
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
to
a
policeman
,
that
I
will
!
 
<EOS>
do
you
see
how
you
have
hurt
the
little
girl
?
 
<EOS>
do
you
?
"
<EOS>
accompany
every
sentence
with
a
violent
jerk
of
passionate
anger
.
  
<EOS>
the
lad
look
hard
and
defying
;
but
withal
terrify
at
the
threat
of
the
policeman
,
those
ogre
of
our
street
to
all
unlucky
urchin
.
<EOS>
the
nurse
see
it
,
and
begin
to
drag
him
along
,
with
a
view
of
make
what
she
call
"
a
wholesome
impression
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
terror
increase
and
with
it
his
irritation
;
when
the
little
sweet
face
,
choke
away
its
sobs
,
pull
down
nurse
's
head
and
say
   
"
please
,
dear
nurse
,
I
be
not
much
hurt
;
it
be
very
silly
to
cry
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
not
mean
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
he
do
not
know
what
he
be
do
,
do
you
,
little
boy
?
 
<EOS>
Nurse
will
not
call
a
policeman
,
so
do
not
be
frighten
.
"
 
<EOS>
and
she
put
up
her
little
mouth
to
be
kiss
by
her
injurer
,
just
as
she
have
be
teach
to
do
at
home
to
"
make
peace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
that
lad
will
mind
,
and
be
more
gentle
for
the
time
to
come
,
I
will
be
bind
,
thank
to
that
little
lady
,
"
say
a
passer
-
by
,
half
to
himself
,
and
half
to
Mr.
Carson
,
whom
he
have
observe
to
notice
the
scene
.
  
<EOS>
the
latter
take
no
apparent
heed
of
the
remark
,
but
pass
on
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
child
's
pleading
remind
him
of
the
low
,
broken
voice
he
have
so
lately
hear
,
penitently
and
humbly
urge
the
same
extenuation
of
his
great
guilt
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
I
be
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
have
some
association
with
those
word
;
he
have
hear
,
or
read
of
that
plea
somewhere
before
.
 
<EOS>
where
be
it
?
  
<EOS>
"
Could
it
be
?
"
    
<EOS>
He
would
look
when
he
get
home
.
 
<EOS>
so
when
he
enter
his
house
he
go
straight
and
silently
upstairs
to
his
library
,
and
take
down
the
great
,
large
,
handsome
Bible
,
all
grand
and
golden
,
with
its
leave
adhere
together
from
the
bookbinder
's
press
,
so
little
have
it
be

<EOS>
on

(
which
fall
open

be

and
his

"
  
<EOS>
to
make
the
entry
complete
,
his
death
should
now
be
add
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
page
become
hide
by
the
gathering
mist
of
tear
.
  
<EOS>
think
upon
thought
,
and
recollection
upon
recollection
come
crowd
in
,
from
the
remembrance
of
the
proud
day
when
he
have
purchase
the
costly
book
,
in
order
to
write
down
the
birth
of
the
little
babe
of
a
day
old
.
  
<EOS>
He
lay
his
head
down
on
the
open
page
,
and
let
the
tear
fall
slowly
on
the
spotless
leave
.
  
<EOS>
His
son
's
murderer
be
discover
;
have
confess
his
guilt
,
and
yet
(
strange
to
say
)
<EOS>
he
could
not
hate
him
with
the
vehemence
of
hatred
he
have
feel
,
when
he
have
imagine
him
a
young
man
,
full
of
lusty
life
,
defy
all
law
,
human
and
divine
.
 
<EOS>
in
spite
of
his
desire
to
retain
the
revengeful
feeling
he
consider
as
a
duty
to
his
dead
son
,
something
of
pity
would
steal
in
for
the
poor
,
waste
skeleton
of
a
man
,
the
smitten
creature
,
who
have
tell
him
of
his
sin
,
and
implore
his
pardon
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
day
of
his
childhood
and
youth
,
Mr.
Carson
have
be
accustom
to
poverty
;
but
it
be
honest
,
decent
poverty
;
not
the
grind
squalid
misery
he
have
remark
in
every
part
of
John
Barton
's
house
,
and
which
contrast
strangely
with
the
pompous
sumptuousness
of
the
room
in
which
he
now
sit
.
 
<EOS>
unaccustomed
wonder
fill
his
mind
at
the
reflection
of
the
different
lot
of
the
brother
of
mankind
.
  
<EOS>
then
he
rouse
himself
from
his
reverie
,
and
turn
to
the
object
of
his
search
 
<EOS>
the
Gospel
,
where
he
half
expect
to
find
the
tender
pleading
:
"
<EOS>
They
know
not
what
they
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
murk
midnight
by
this
time
,
and
the
house
be
still
and
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
to
interrupt
the
old
man
in
his
unwonted
study
.
  
<EOS>
year
ago
,
the
Gospel
have
be
his
task
-
book
in
learn
to
read
.
<EOS>
so
many
year
ago
,
that
he
have
become
familiar
with
the
event
before
he
could
comprehend
the
Spirit
that
make
the
life
.
  
<EOS>
He
fall
to
the
narrative
now
afresh
,
with
all
the
interest
of
a
little
child
.
 
<EOS>
He
begin
at
the
beginning
,
and
read
on
almost
greedily
,
understand
for
the
first
time
the
full
meaning
of
the
story
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
to
the
end
;
<EOS>
the
awful
end
.
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
the
haunting
word
of
plead
.
  
<EOS>
He
shut
the
book
,
and
think
deeply
.
  
<EOS>
all
night
long
,
the
Archangel
combat
with
the
Demon
.
  
<EOS>
all
night
long
,
other
watch
by
the
bed
of
Death
.
 
<EOS>
John
Barton
have
revive
to
fitful
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
He
speak
at
time
with
even
something
of
his
former
energy
;
and
in
the
racy
Lancashire
dialect
he
have
always
use
when
speak
freely
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
I
have
so
often
be
hanker
after
the
right
way
;
and
it
be
a
hard
one
for
a
poor
man
to
find
.
 
<EOS>
at
least
it
be
be
so
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
no
one
learn
me
,
and
no
one
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
be
a
little
chap
they
teach
me
to
read
,
and
then
they
never
give
no
book
;
only
I
hear
say
the
Bible
be
a
good
book
.
 
<EOS>
so
when
I
grow
thoughtful
,
and
puzzle
,
I
take
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
would
never
believe
black
be
black
,
or
night
be
night
,
when
you
see
all
about
you
act
as
if
black
be
white
,
and
night
be
day
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
much
I
can
say
for
myself
in
t'other
world
.
 
<EOS>
God
forgive
me
;
but
I
can
say
this
,
I
would
fain
have
go
after
the
Bible
rule
if
I
would
see
folk
credit
it
;
they
all
speak
up
for
it
,
and
go
and
do
clean
contrary
.
 
<EOS>
in
those
day
I
would
ha
'
go
about
wi
'
my
Bible
,
like
a
little
child
,
my
finger
in
th
'
place
,
and
ask
the
meaning
of
this
or
that
text
,
and
no
one
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
take
out
two
or
three
text
as
clear
as
glass
,
and
I
try
to
do
what
they
bid
me
do
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
know
how
it
be
,
<EOS>
master
and
man
,
all
alike
care
no
more
for
mind
those
text
,
than
I
do
for
th
'
Lord
Mayor
of
London
;
so
I
grow
to
think
it
must
be
a
sham
put
upon
poor
ignorant
folk
,
woman
,
and
such
like
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
long
I
try
to
live
Gospel

wise

but
it
be
liker
heaven
than
any

bit

<EOS>
I
would
old
Alice
to
strengthen
me

but
every
one
else
say
,
"
stand
up
for
thy
right

or
thou'lt
never
get

;
and
wife
and
child
never
speak
,
but
their
helplessness
cry
aloud

and
I
be
drive
to
do
as
other
do

and
then
Tom
die

You

all
about
that

I
be

<EOS>
then
again
he
speak
,
after
some
minute
of
hushed
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
all
along
it
come
natural
to
love
folk

now
I

I

my

my
try

at
last
I

up

I

from

Job

Mary

as
the
final

and
morning
dawn

Jem
suggest
some
alleviation
to

although
Mary
have
hardly

conscious
of
her

and
it
have
be
more
like
a
secret
instinct
inform
her
soul
,
than
the
result
of
any
process
of
reasoning
,
she
have
feel
for
some
time
(
ever
since
her
return
from
Liverpool
,
in

,
that
for
her
father
there
be
but
one
thing
to

that

<EOS>
She
have
see
that
Conscience

give
the
mortal
wound
to
his
earthly

she
do
not
dare
to
question
of
the
infinite
mercy
of
God

what
the
Future

would
be
to
him

<EOS>
though
at
first
desolate
and
stun
by
the
blow
which
have
fall
on
herself
,
she
be
resign
and
submissive
as
soon
as
she
recover
strength
enough
to
ponder
and
consider
a
little
;
and
you
may
be
sure
that
no
tenderness
or
love
be
want
on
Jem
's
part
,
and
no
consideration
and
sympathy
on
that
of
Job
and
Margaret
to
soothe

comfort
the
girl
who
now
stand
alone
in

do

She
put
herself
into
their

with
the
trust

glad
to
be
undisturbed
in
the
reverie

which
fill
her
eye
with
tear

cause
them
to
fall
quietly

down

It
be
the
long
day
she
have
ever
know
in
her
life
;
every
change
and
every
occupation
be
take
away
from
her
:
but
perhaps
the
length
of
quiet
time
thus
afford
be
really
good
,
although
its
duration
weigh
upon
her
;
for
by
this
mean
she
contemplate
her
situation

fully
understand
that
the
morning
's

have
leave
her

she

spare
the

just

should
naturally

in

,
lie
down
to
slumber

<EOS>
for
in
such
case
,
wear
out
by
anxiety
,
and
it
may
be
by
much
watch
,
our
very
excess
of
grief
rock
itself
to
sleep
,
before
we
have
have
time
to
realise
its
cause
;
and
we
waken
,
with
a
start
of
agony
like
a
fresh
stab

the

She
feel
bind
by
regard
,
as
well
as
by
etiquette
,
to
go
and
see
her
future
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
and
by
an
old
association
of
ideas
(
perhaps
of
death
with
churchyard
,
and
church
with
Sunday
)
<EOS>
she
think
it
necessary
to
put
on
her
good
,
and
latterly
unused
clothe
,
the
airing
of
which
on
a
little
clothe
-
horse
before
the
fire
seem
to
give
her
a
not
unpleasing

<EOS>
when
Jem
return
home
late
in
the
evening
succeed
John
Barton
's
death
,
weary
and
oppress
with
the
occurrence

excitement
of
the
day

he
find
his
mother
busy
about
her
mourning
,

much
inclined
to
talk

although
he
long
for
quiet
,
he
could

sit
down

answer

how
do
you
hear

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Job
come
over
here
,
and
tell
me
,
on

<EOS>
do
he
make
a
fine
end

"
  
<EOS>
It
strike
Jem
that
she
have
not
hear
of
the
confession
which
have
be
make
by
John
Barton
on
his
death
-
bed
;
he
remember
Job
Legh
's
discretion
,
and
he
determine
that
if
it
could
be
avoid
his
mother
should
never
hear
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
the
difficulty
to
be
anticipate
in
preserve
the
secret
would
be
obviate
,
if
he
could
induce
his
mother
to
fall
into
the
plan
he
have
name
to
Mary
of
emigrate
to
Canada
.
 
<EOS>
the
reason
which
render
this
secrecy
desirable
relate
to
the
domestic
happiness
he
hope
for
.
 
<EOS>
with
his
mother
's
irritable
temper
he
could
hardly
expect
that
all
allusion
to
the
crime
of
John
Barton
would
be
for
ever
restrain
from
pass
her
lip
,
and
he
know
the
deep
trial
which
such
reference
would
be
to
Mary
.
<EOS>
accordingly
he
resolve
as
soon
as
possible
in
the
morning
to
go
to
Job
and
beseech
his
silence
;
he
trust
that
secrecy
in
that
quarter
,
even
if
the
knowledge
have
be
extend
to
Margaret
,
may
be
easily
secure
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
would
be
Mr.
Carson
's
course
?
  
<EOS>
be
there
any
mean
by
which
he
may
be
persuade
to
spare
John
Barton
's
memory
?
  
<EOS>
He
be
rouse
up
from
this
train
of
thought
by
his
mother
's
more
irritated
tone
of
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"

she

thou

I

think
I
when

he
will
be
sure
to
be
good
company

see
he
be
in

house
at
the

He

<EOS>
Jem
be
glad
to
escape
from
all
this
talk
,
to
the
solitude
and
quiet
of
his
own
room
,
where
he
could
lie
and
think
uninterruptedly
of
what
have
happen
and
remain
to
be
do
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
thing
be
to
seek
an
interview
with
Mr.
Duncombe
,
his
former
master
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
early
the
next
morning
Jem
set
off
on
his
walk
to
the
work
,
where
for
so
many
year
his
day
have
be
spend
;
where
for
so
long
a
time
his
thought
have
be
think
,
his
hope
and
fear
experience
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
cheer
feeling
to
remember
that
henceforward
he
be
to
be
sever
from
all
these
familiar
place
;
nor
be
his
spirit
enliven
by
the
evident
feeling
of
the
majority
of
those
who
have
be
his
fellow
-
workman
.
<EOS>
as
he
stand
in
the
entrance
to
the
foundry
,
await
Mr.
Duncombe
's
leisure
,
many
of
those
employ
in
the
work
pass
him
on
their
return
from
breakfast
;
and
,
with
one
or
two
exception
,
without
any
acknowledgment
of
former
acquaintance
beyond
a
distant
nod
at
the
utmost
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
hard
,
"
say
Jem
to
himself
,
with
a
bitter
and
indignant
feeling
rise
in
his
throat
,
"
that
let
a
man
's
life
be
what
it
may

folk
be
so
ready
to
credit
the
first
word
against
him

I
could
live
it
down
if
I
stay
in
England

then
what
would
not
Mary
have
to
bear
?
 
<EOS>
sooner
or
later
the
truth
would
out
;

then
she
would
be
a
show
to
folk
for
many
a
day

do
not
believe
in

guilt

in
spite
of
the
silence
in
which
he
again
this
day
hear
the
imputation
of
it

he
agree

under

the

of
the
moral

and
text
which
she
fancy
be
expect
from
visitor

occasion

a
good

speech
as

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilson
be
weep
herself
long
before
she
have
end
this
speech
,
which
be
so
different
to
all
she
have
plan
to
say
,
and
from
all
the
formal
piety
she
have
lay
in
store
for
the
visit
;
for
this
be
heart
's
piety
,
and
need
no
garnish
of
text
to
make
it
true
religion
,
pure
and
undefiled
.
  
<EOS>
They
sit
together
on
the
same
chair
,
their
arm
encircle
each
other
;
they
weep
for
the
same
dead
;
they
have
the
same
hope
,
and
trust
,
and
overflow
love
in
the
living
.
  
<EOS>
from
that
time
forward
,
hardly
a
pass
cloud
dim
the
happy
confidence
of
their
intercourse
;
even
by
Jem
would
his
mother
's
temper
sooner
be
irritate
than
by
Mary
;
before
the
latter
she
repress
her
occasional
nervous
ill
-
humour
till
the
habit
of
indulge
it
be
perceptibly
decrease
.
  
<EOS>
year
afterwards
,
in
conversation
with
Jem
,
he
be
startle
by
a
chance
expression
which
drop
from
his
mother
's
lip
;
it
imply
a
knowledge
of
John
Barton
's
crime
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
many
a
long
day
since
they
have
see
any
Manchester
people
who
could
have
reveal
the
secret
(
if
indeed
it
be
know
in
Manchester
,
against
which
Jem
have
guard
in
every
possible
way
)
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
be
lead
to
inquire
first
as
to
the
extent
,
and
then
as
to
the
source
of
her
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
Mary
herself
who
have
tell
all
.
  
<EOS>
for
on
the
morning
to
which
this
chapter
principally
relate
,
as
Mary
sit
weep
,
and
as
Mrs.
Wilson
comfort
her
by
every
tender
word
and
caress
,
she
reveal
,
to
the
dismayed
and
astonish
Jane
,
the
sting
of
her
deep
sorrow
;
the
crime
which
stain
her
dead
father
's
memory
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
quite
unconscious
that
Jem
have
keep
it
secret
from
his
mother
;
she
have
imagine
it
bruit
abroad
as
the
suspicion
against
her
lover
have
be
;
so
word
after
word
(
drop
from
her
lip
in
the
supposition
that
Mrs.
Wilson
know
all
)
<EOS>
have
tell
the
tale
and
reveal
the
cause
of
her
deep
anguish
;
deep
than
be
ever
cause
by
death
alone
.
  
<EOS>
on
large
occasion
like
the
present
,
Mrs.
Wilson
's
innate
generosity
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
Her
weak
and
ailing
frame
impart
its
irritation
to
her
conduct
in
small
thing
,
and
daily
trifle
;
but
she
have
deep
and
noble
sympathy
with
great
sorrow
,
and
even
at
the
time
that
Mary
speak
she
allow
no
expression
of
surprise
or
horror
to
escape
her
lip
.
 
<EOS>
She
give
way
to
no
curiosity
as
to
the
untold
detail
;
she
be
as
secret
and
trustworthy
as
her
son
himself
;
and
if
in
year
to
come
her
anger
be
occasionally
excited
against
Mary
,
and
she
,
on
rare
occasion
,
yield
to
ill
-
temper
against
her
daughter
-
in
-
law
,
she
would
upbraid
her
for
extravagance
,
or
stinginess
,
or
over
-
dressing
,
or
under
-
dressing
,
or
too
much
mirth
or
too
much
gloom
,
but
never
,
never
in
her
most
uncontrolled
moment
do
she
allude
to
any
one
of
the
circumstance
relate
to
Mary
's
flirtation
with
Harry
Carson
,
or
his
murderer
;
and
always
when
she
speak
of
John
Barton
,
name
him
with
the
respect
due
to
his
conduct
before
the
last
,
miserable
,
guilty
month
of
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
therefore
it
come
like
a
blow
to
Jem
,
when
,
after
year
have
pass
away
,
he
gather
his
mother
's
knowledge
of
the
whole
affair
.
 
<EOS>
from
the
day
when
he
learn
(
not
without
remorse
)
<EOS>
what
hide
depth
of
self
-
restraint
she
have
in
her
soul
,
his
manner
to
her
,
always
tender
and
respectful
,
become
reverential
;
and
it
be
more
than
ever
a
love
strife
between
him
and
Mary
which
should
most
contribute
towards
the
happiness
of
the
decline
year
of
their
mother
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
speak
of
the
event
which
have
occur
only
lately
,
while
I
have
yet
many
thing
to
tell
you
that
happen
six
or
seven
year
ago
.
   
<EOS>
details
connect
with
the
murder
.
 
<EOS>
"
the
rich
man
dine
,
while
the
poor
man
pine
,
and
eat
his
heart
away
<EOS>
;
"
They
teach
us
lie
,
"
he
sternly
cry
,
"
Would
brother
do
as
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
the
Dream
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Carson
stand
at
one
of
the
breathing
-
moment
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
the
object
of
the
toil
,
the
fear
,
and
the
wish
of
his
past
year
,
be
suddenly
hide
from
his
sight
,
 
vanish
into
the
deep
mystery
which
circumscribe
existence
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
even
the
vengeance
which
he
have
cherish
,
take
away
from
before
his
eye
,
as
by
the
hand
of
God
.
  
<EOS>
event
like
these
would
have
startle
the
most
thoughtless
into
reflection
,
much
more
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Carson
,
whose
mind
,
if
not
enlarge
,
be
energetic
;
indeed
,
whose
very
energy
,
have
be
hitherto
the
cause
of
the
employment
of
his
power
in
only
one
direction
,
have
prevent
him
from
become
largely
and
philosophically
comprehensive
in
his
view
.
  
<EOS>
but
now
the
foundation
of
his
past
life
be
raze
to
the
ground
,
and
the
place
they
have
once
occupy
be
sow
with
salt
,
to
be
rebuild
no
more
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
like
the
change
from
this
life
to
that
other
hide
one
,
when
so
many
of
the
motive
which
have
actuate
all
our
earthly
existence
,
will
have
become
more
fleeting
than
the
shadow
of
a
dream
.
 
<EOS>
with
a
wrench
of
his
soul
from
the
past
,
so
much
of
which
be
as
nothing
,
and
bad
than
nothing
to
him
now
,
Mr.
Carson
take
some
hour
,
after
he
have
witness
the
death
of
his
son
's
murderer
,
to
consider
his
situation
.
  
<EOS>
but
suddenly
,
while
he
be
deliberate
,
and
search
for
motive
which
should
be
effective
to
compel
him
to
exertion
and
action
once
more
;
while
he
contemplate
the
desire
after
rich
,
social
distinction
,
a
name
among
the
merchant
-
prince
amidst
whom
he
move
,
and
see
these
false
substance
fade
away
into
the
shadow
they
truly
be
,
and
one
by
one
disappear
into
the
grave
of
his
son
,
 
suddenly
,
I
say
,
the
thought
arise
within
him
that
more
yet
remain
to
be
learn
about
the
circumstance
and
feeling
which
have
prompt
John
Barton
's
crime
;
and
when
once
this
mournful
curiosity
be
excite
,
it
seem
to
gather
strength
in
every
moment
that
its
gratification
be
delay
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
he
send
a
message
to
summon
Job
Legh
and
Jem
Wilson
,
from
whom
he
promise
himself
some
elucidation
of
what
be
as
yet
unexplained
;
while
he
himself
set
forth
to
call
on
Mr.
Bridgnorth
,
whom
he
know
to
have
be
Jem
's
attorney
,
with
a
glimmer
suspicion
intrude
on
his
mind
,
which
he
strove
to
repel
,
that
Jem
may
have
have
some
share
in
his
son
's
death
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
return
before
his
summon
visitor
arrive
;
and
have
time
enough
to
recur
to
the
evening
on
which
John
Barton
have
make
his
confession
.
 
<EOS>
He
remember
with
mortification
how
he
have
forget
his
proud
reserve
,
and
his
habitual
concealment
of
his
feeling
,
and
have
lay
bare
his
agony
of
grief
in
the
presence
of
these
two
man
who
be
come
to
see
him
by
his
desire
;
and
he
entrench
himself
behind
stiff
barrier
of
self
-
control
,
through
which
he
hope
no
appearance
of
emotion
would
force
its
way
in
the
conversation
he
anticipate
.
  
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
when
the
servant
announce
that
two
man
be
there
by
appointment
to
speak
to
him
,
and
he
have
desire
that
they
may
be
show
into
the
library
where
he
sit
,
any
watcher
may
have
perceive
by
the
tremble
hand
,
and
shake
head
,
not
only
how
much
he
be
age
by
the
occurrence
of
the
last
few
week
,
but
also
how
much
he
be
agitate
at
the
thought
of
the
impending
interview
.
  
<EOS>
but
he
so
far
succeed
in
command
himself
at
first
,
as
to
appear
to
Jem
Wilson
and
<EOS>
Job
Legh
one
of
the
hard
and
most
haughty
man
they
have
ever
speak
to
,
and
to
forfeit
all
the
interest
which
he
have
previously
excite
in
their
mind
by
his
unreserved
display
of
deep
and
genuine
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
when
he
have
desire
them
to
be
seat
,
he
shade
his
face
with
his
hand
for
an
instant
before
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
call
on
Mr.
Bridgnorth
this
morning
,
"
say
he
,
at
last
;
"
as
I
expect
,
he
can
give
me
but
<EOS>
little
satisfaction
on
some
point
respect
the
occurrence
on
the
18th
of
last
month
which
I
desire
to
have
clear
up
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
you
two
can
tell
me
what
I
want
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
as
intimate
friend
of
Barton
's
you
probably
know
,
or
can
conjecture
a
good
deal
.
 
<EOS>
have
no
scruple
as
to
speak
the
truth
.
<EOS>
what
you
say
in
this
room
shall
never
be
name
again
by
me
.
<EOS>
besides
,
you
be
aware
that
the
law
allow
no
one
to
be
try
twice
for
the
same
offence
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
stop
for
a
minute
,
for
the
mere
act
of
speak
be
fatigue
to
him
after
the
excitement
of
the
last
few
day
.
  
<EOS>
Job
Legh
take
the
opportunity
of
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
go
to
be
affront
either
for
myself

Jem
at
what
you
have
just
now

about
the
truth

<EOS>
You
do
not
know
us

there
be
an
end
on't
;
only
it
be
as
well
for
folk
to
think
other
good

true
until
they
be
prove
contrary

<EOS>
ask
what
you
like

I
will
answer
for
it

we
will
either
tell
truth

hold
our
tongue

"
I
beg
your
pardon

Mr.
Carson

slightly
bow
his
head

what
I
wish
to
know
be

refer
to
a
slip
of
paper
he
hold
in
his

so
much

hardly
adjust
his
glass
to
his

whether
you

Wilson

can
explain
how
Barton
come
possess
of
your
gun

I
believe
you
refuse
this
explanation
to
Mr.
Bridgnorth

<EOS>
"
I
do
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
say
what
I
know

I
see
it
would
criminate
Barton

so
I
refuse
tell
aught

<EOS>
to
you
,
sir

now
I
will
tell
everything

anything

only
it

little

the
gun
be
my
father

before
it
be
mine
,
and
long
ago
he
and
John
Barton
have
a
fancy
for
shoot
at
the
gallery
;
and
they
use
always
to
take
this
gun
,
and
brag
that
though
it
be
old

fashioned
it
be
sure

<EOS>
Jem

with
self
-
upbraid
pain
how
Mr.
Carson
wince
at
these
last
word
,
but
at
each
irrepressible
and
involuntary
evidence
of
feeling
,
the
heart
of
the
two
man
warm
towards
him

Jem
go
on
speak

"
one
day
in
the
week
 
I

it
be
on
the
Wednesday

<EOS>
yes

it

<EOS>
it
be
on
St.
Patrick

I

go
to
my
dinner

Mother
be
out

he
would
find
no

He
say
he
would
come
to
borrow
the
old
gun
,
and
that
he
would
have
make
bold
,
and
take
it
,
but
it
be
not
to
be
see
.

Mother
be
afraid
of
it

so
after
father
's
death
(
for
while
he
be
alive

she
seem
to
think
he
could
manage
it

I
have
carry
it
to
my

go
up

I
do
not

when
I
give
it
him

<EOS>
at
first
he
mutter
something
about
the
shoot
gallery

I
never
doubt
but
that
it
be
for
practice
there
,

do
year
before

Mr.

have
string
up
his
frame
to
an
attitude

upright
attention

now
the
tension
relax
,
and
he
sink
back
in
his

I

judge
from

never

to
the
effect
produce
on

the
great

mock

present

Mr.

an
Owenite

what
hurt
him
sore

rankle
in
him
as
long

I

,
sir

it
rankle
in
many
a

heart
far
more
than
the

that
those

hard
to
him
that
a
heap
of
gold
should
part
him

he

you

surely
it

on

both

<EOS>
Jem
have
maintain
a
manly
and
dignified
reserve
ever
since
he
have
make
his
open
statement
of
all
he
know
.
 
<EOS>
now
both
the
man
rise
and
bow
low
,
look
at
Mr.
Carson
with
the
deep
human
interest
<EOS>
they
could
not
fail
to
take
in
one
who
have
endure
and
forgive
a
deep
injury
;
and
who
struggle
hard
,
as
it
be
evident
he
do
,
to
bear
up
like
a
man
under
his
affliction
.
  
<EOS>
He
bow
low
in
return
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
suddenly
come
forward
and
shake
them
by
the
hand
;
and
thus
,
without
a
word
more
,
they
part
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
stage
in
the
contemplation
and
endurance
of
great
sorrow
,
which
endow
man
with
the
same
earnestness
and
clearness
of
think
that
in
some
of
old
take
the
form
of
Prophecy
.
 
<EOS>
to
those
who
have
large
capability
of
loving
and
suffer
,
unite
with
great
power
of
firm
endurance
,
there
come
a
time
in
their
woe
,
when
they
be
lift
out
of
the
contemplation
of
their
individual
case
into
a
search
inquiry
into
the
nature
of
their
calamity
,
and
the
remedy
(
if
remedy
there
be
)
which
may
prevent
its
recurrence
to
other
as
well
as
to
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
hence
the
beautiful
,
noble
effort
which
be
from
time
to
time
bring
to
light
,
as
be
continuously
make
by
those
who
have
once
hang
on
the
cross
of
agony
,
in
order
that
other
may
not
suffer
as
they
have
do
;
one
of
the
grand
end
which
sorrow
can
accomplish
;
the
sufferer
wrestling
with
God
's
messenger
until
a
blessing
be
leave
behind
,
not
for
one
alone
but
for
generation
.
  
<EOS>
It
take
time
before
the
stern
nature
of
Mr.
Carson
be
compel
to
the
recognition
of
this
secret
of
comfort
,
and
that
same
sternness
prevent
his
reaping
any
benefit
in
public
estimation
from
the
action
he
perform
;
for
the
character
be
more
easily
change
than
the
habit
and
manner
originally
form
by
that
character
,
and
to
his
die
day
Mr.
Carson
be
consider
hard
and
cold
by
those
who
only
casually
see
him
or
superficially
know
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
those
who
be
admit
into
his
confidence
be
aware
,
that
the
wish
that
lie
nearest
to
his
heart
be
that
none
may
suffer
from
the
cause
from
which
he
have
suffer
;
that
a
perfect
understanding
,
and
complete
confidence
and
love
,
may
exist
between
master
and
man
;
that
the
truth
may
be
recognise
that
the
interest
of
one
be
the
interest
of
all
,
and
,
as
such
,
require
the
consideration
and
deliberation
of
all
;
that
hence
it
be
most
desirable
to
have
educate
worker
,
capable
of
judging
,
not
mere
machine
of
ignorant
man
:
and
to
have
them
bind
to
their
employer
by
the
tie
of
respect
and
affection
,
not
by
mere
money
bargain
alone
;
in
short
,
to
acknowledge
the
Spirit
of
Christ
as
the
regulating
law
between
both
party
.
  
<EOS>
many
of
the
improvement
now
in
practice
in
the
system
of
employment
in
Manchester
,
owe
their
origin
to
short
,
earnest
sentence

by
Mr.

<EOS>
many
and
many
yet

into

from

It

they

at

recognise
under

description

a
woman
know
to
them
under
the
name
of
the
"
Butterfly

from
the
gaiety
of
her
dress
a
year
or
two
ago

by
their
help
he
trace
out
one
of
her
haunt

a
low
lodging

house
behind
Peter

street

<EOS>
He
and
his
companion
,
a
kind
-
hearted
policeman
,
be
admit
,
suspiciously
enough
,
by
the
landlady
,
who
usher
them
into
a
large
garret
where
twenty
or
thirty
people
of
all
age
and
both
sex
lay
and
dose
away
the
day
,
choose
the
evening
and
night
for
their
trade
of
beggary
,
thieving
,
or
prostitution

<EOS>
"
I
know
the
Butterfly
be
here
,
"
say
she
,
look
round
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
come
in
,
the
night
before
last
,
and
say
she
have
not
a
penny
to
get
a
place
for
shelter
;
and
that
if
she
be
far
away
in
the
country
she
could
steal
aside
and
die
in
a
copse
,
or
a
clough
,
like
the
wild
animal
;
but
here
the
police
would
let
no
one
alone
in
the
street
,
and
she
want
a
spot
to
die
in
,
in
peace
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
queer
sort
of
peace
we
have
here
,
but
that
night
the
room
be
uncommon
empty
,
and
I
be
not
a
hard
-
hearted
woman

(
I
wish
I
be

I
could
ha

make
a
good
thing
out
of
it

afore

I
be
harder

,
so
I
send
her
up

but
she
be
not
here
now

I
think
.

<EOS>
"
be
she
very
bad

ask
Jem

<EOS>
"
ay
!
nought
but
skin
and
bone
,
with
a
cough
to
tear
her
in
two

"
  
<EOS>
They
make
some
inquiry
,
and
find
that
in
the
restlessness
of
approach
death
,
she
have
long
to
be
once
more
in
the
open
air
,
and
have
go
forth
 
<EOS>
where
,
no
one
seem
to
be
able
to
tell
.
<EOS>
leave
many
message
for
her
,
and
direction
that
he
be
to
be
send
for
if
either
the
policeman
or
the
landlady
obtain
any
clue
to
her
whereabouts
,
Jem
bend
his
step
towards
Mary
's
house
;
for
he
have
not
see
her
all
that
long
day
of
search
.
 
<EOS>
He
tell
her
of
his
proceeding
and
want
of
success
;
and
both
be
sadden
at
the
recital
,
and
sit
silent
for
some
time
.
  
<EOS>
after
awhile
they
begin
talk
over
their
plan
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
day
or
two
,
Mary
be
to
give
up
house
,
and
go
and
live
for
a
week
or
so
with
Job
Legh
,
until
the
time
of
her
marriage
,
which
would
take
place
immediately
before
sailing
;
they
talk
themselves
back
into
silence
and
delicious
reverie
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
sit
by
Jem
,
his
arm
around
her
waist
,
her
head
on
his
shoulder
;
and
think
over
the
scene
which
 
have
pass
in
that
home
she
be
so
soon
to
leave
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
suddenly
she
feel
Jem
start
,
and
start
too
without
know
why
;
she
try
to
see
his
countenance
,
but
the
shade
of
evening
have
deepen
so
much
she
could
read
no
expression
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
turn
to
the
window
;
she
look
and
see
a
white
face
press
against
the
pane
on
the
outside
,
gaze
intently
into
the
dusky
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
while
they
watch
,
as
if
fascinate
by
the
appearance
,
and
 
unable
to
think
or
stir
,
a
film
come
over
the
bright
,
feverish
,
glitter
eye
outside
,
and
the
form
sink
down
to
the

fainting

lie
the
poor

Butterfly
 
<EOS>
the
once
innocent
Esther
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
come
(
as
a
wounded
deer
drag
its
heavy
limb
once
more
to
the
green
coolness
of
the
lair
in
which
it
be
bear
,
there
to
die
)
to
see
the
place
familiar

again
before

<EOS>
They
carry
her
upstairs
and
lay
her
on
Mary
's
bed
,
not
daring
to
undress
her
,
lest
any
motion
should
frighten
the
tremble
life
away
;
but
it
be
all
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
towards
midnight
,
she
open
wide
her
eye
and
look
around
on
the
once
familiar
room
;
<EOS>
Job
Legh
knelt
by

bed
pray
aloud
and
fervently
for
her
,
but
he
stop
as
he
see
her
roused
look
.
 
<EOS>
She
sit
up
in
bed
with
a
sudden
convulsive
motion
.
  
<EOS>
"
have
it
be
a
dream
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
ask
she
wildly
.
 
<EOS>
then
with
a
habit
,
which
come
like
instinct
even
in
that
awful
die
hour
,
her
hand
seek
for
a
locket
which
hang
conceal
in
her
bosom
,
and
,
find
that
,
she
know
all
be
true
which
have
befall
her
since
last
she
lie
an
innocent
girl
on
that
bed
.
  
<EOS>
She

,
and
speak
word
never
more

<EOS>
She
hold
the
locket
contain
her
child

hair
still
in
her
hand
,
and
once
or
twice
she
kiss
it
with
a
long
soft
kiss
.
 
<EOS>
She
cry
feebly
and
sadly
as
long
as
she
have
any
strength
to
cry
,
and
then
she
die
.
  
<EOS>
They
lay
her
in
one
grave
with
John
Barton

<EOS>
and
there
they
lie
without
