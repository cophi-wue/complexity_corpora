I
SHALL
never
forget
the
one
-
fourth
serious
and
three
-
fourth
comical
astonishment
,
with
which
,
on
the
morning
of
the
third
of
January
eighteen
-
hundred
-
and
-
forty
-
two
,
I
open
the
door
of
,
and
put
my
head
into
,
a
"
state
-
room
"
on
board
the
Britannia
steam
-
packet
,
twelve
hundred
ton
burthen
per
register
,
bind
for
Halifax
and
Boston
,
and
carry
Her
Majesty
's
mail
.
   
<EOS>
that
this
state
-
room
have
be
specially
engage
for
"
Charles
Dickens
,
Esquire
,
and
Lady
,
"
be
render
sufficiently
clear
even
to
my
scared
intellect
by
a
very
small
manuscript
,
announce
the
fact
,
which
be
pin
on
a
very
flat
quilt
,
cover
a
very
thin
mattress
,
spread
like
a
surgical
plaster
on
a
most
inaccessible
shelf
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
this
be
the
state
-
room
concern
which
Charles
Dickens
,
Esquire
,
and
Lady
,
have
hold
daily
and
nightly
conference
for
at
least
four
month
precede
:
 
that
this
could
by
any
possibility
be
that
small
snug
chamber
of
the
imagination
,
which
Charles
Dickens
,
Esquire
,
with
the
spirit
of
prophecy
strong
upon
him
,
have
always
foretold
would
contain
<EOS>
at
least
one
little
sofa
,
and
which
his
lady
,
with
a
modest
yet
most
magnificent
sense
of
its
limited
dimension
,
have
from
the
first
opined
would
not
hold
more
than
two
enormous
portmanteaus
in
some
odd
corner
out
of
sight
(
portmanteaus
which
could
now
no
more
be
get
in
at
the
door
,
not
to
say
stow
away
,
than
a
giraffe
could
be
persuade
or
force
into
a
flower
-
pot
)
:
 
that
this
utterly
impracticable
,
thoroughly
hopeless
,
and
profoundly
preposterous
box
,
have
the
remote
reference
to
,
or
connection
with
,
those
chaste
and
pretty
,
not
to
say
gorgeous
little
bower
,
sketch
by
a
masterly
hand
,
in
the
highly
varnish
lithographic
plan
hang
up
in
the
agent
's
counting
-
house
in
the
city
of
London
:
 
that
this
room
of
state
,
in
short
,
could
be
anything
but
a
pleasant
fiction
and
cheerful
jest
of
the
captain
's
,
invent
and
put
in
practice
for
the
well
relish
and
enjoyment
of
the
real
state
-
room
presently
to
be
disclose
:
---
these
be
truth
which
I
really
could
not
,
for
the
moment
,
bring
my
mind
at
all
to
bear
upon
or
comprehend
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
sit
down
upon
a
kind
of
horsehair
slab
,
or
perch
,
of
which
there
be
two
within
;
and
look
,
without
any
expression
of
countenance
whatever
,
at
some
friend
who
have
come
on
board
with
us
,
and
who
be
crush
their
face
into
all
manner
of
shape
by
endeavour
to
squeeze
them
through
the
small
doorway
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
experience
a
pretty
smart
shock
before
come
below
,
<EOS>
which
,
but
that
we
be
the
most
sanguine
people
live
,
may
have
prepare
us
for
the
bad
.
 
<EOS>
the
imaginative
artist
to
whom
I
have
already
make
allusion
,
have
depict
in
the
same
great
work
,
a
chamber
of
almost
interminable
perspective
,
furnish
,
as
Mr
Robins
would
say
,
in
a
style
of
more
than
Eastern
splendour
,
and
fill
(
but
not
inconveniently
so
)
with
group
of
lady
and
gentleman
,
in
the
very
high
state
of
enjoyment
and
vivacity
.
<EOS>
before
descend
into
the
bowel
of
the
ship
,
we
have
pass
from
the
deck
into
a
long
narrow
apartment
,
not
unlike
a
gigantic
hearse
with
window
in
the
side
;
have
at
the
upper
end
a
melancholy
stove
,
at
which
three
or
four
chilly
steward
be
warm
their
hand
;
while
on
either
side
,
extend
down
its
whole
dreary
length
,
be
a
long
,
long
table
,
over
each
of
which
a
rack
,
fix
to
the
low
roof
,
and
stick
full
of
drinking
-
glass
and
cruet
-
stand
,
hint
dismally
at
rolling
sea
and
heavy
weather
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
at
that
time
see
the
ideal
presentment
of
this
chamber
which
have
since
gratify
me
so
much
,
but
I
observe
that
one
of
our
friend
who
have
make
the
arrangement
for
our
voyage
,
turn
pale
on
enter
,
retreat
on
the
friend
behind
him
.
<EOS>
,
smote
his
forehead
involuntarily
,
and
say
below
his
breath
,
"
<EOS>
impossible
!
<EOS>
it
can
not
be
!
"
<EOS>
or
word
to
that
effect
.
 
<EOS>
He
recover
himself
however
by
a
great
effort
,
and
after
a
preparatory
cough
or
two
,
cry
,
with
a
ghastly
smile
which
be
still
before
me
,
look
at
the
same
time
<EOS>
round
the
wall
,
"
ha
!
<EOS>
the
breakfast
-
room
,
steward
---
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
all
foresaw
what
the
answer
must
be
:
 
<EOS>
we
know
the
agony
he
suffer
.
<EOS>
He
have
often
speak
of
the
saloon
;
have
take
in
and
live
upon
the
pictorial
idea
;
have
usually
give
us
to
understand
,
at
home
,
that
to
form
a
just
conception
of
it
,
it
would
be
necessary
to
multiply
the
size
and
furniture
of
an
ordinary
drawing
-
room
by
seven
,
and
then
fall
short
of
the
reality
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
man
in
reply
avow
the
truth
;
the
blunt
,
remorseless
,
naked
truth
;
"
this
be
the
saloon
,
sir
"
---
he
actually
reel
beneath
the
blow
.
   
<EOS>
in
person
who
be
so
soon
to
part
,
and
interpose
between
their
else
daily
communication
the
formidable
barrier
of
many
thousand
mile
of
stormy
space
,
and
who
be
for
that
reason
anxious
to
cast
no
other
cloud
,
not
even
the
pass
shadow
of
a
moment
's
disappointment
or
discomfiture
,
upon
the
short
interval
of
happy
companionship
that
yet
remain
to
them
---
in
person
so
situated
,
the
natural
transition
from
these
first
surprise
be
obviously
into
peal
of
hearty
laughter
,
and
I
can
report
that
I
,
for
one
,
be
still
seat
upon
the
slab
or
perch
before
mention
,
roar
outright
until
the
vessel
ring
again
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
in
less
than
two
minute
after
come
upon
it
for
the
first
time
,
we
all
by
common
consent
agree
that
this
state
-
room
be
the
pleasantest
and
most
facetious
and
capital
contrivance
possible
;
and
that
to
have
have
it
one
inch
large
,
would
have
be
quite
a
disagreeable
and
deplorable
state
of
thing
.
 
<EOS>
and
with
this
;
and
with
show
how
,
---
by
very
nearly
close
the
door
,
and
twine
in
and
out
like
serpent
,
and
by
count
the
little
washing
slab
as
standing
-
room
,
---
we
could
manage
to
insinuate
four
people
into
it
,
all
at
one
time
;
and
entreat
each
other
to
observe
how
very
airy
it
be
(
in
dock
)
,
and
how
there
be
a
beautiful
port
-
hole
which
could
be
keep
open
all
day
(
weather
permitting
)
,
and
how
there
be
quite
a
large
bull'
-
eye
just
over
the
looking
-
glass
which
would
render
shave
a
perfectly
easy
and
delightful
process
(
when
the
ship
do
not
roll
too
much
)
;
we
arrive
,
at
last
,
at
the
unanimous
conclusion
that
it
be
rather
spacious
than
otherwise
:
 
though
I
do
verily
believe
that
,
deduct
the
two
berth
,
one
above
the
other
,
than
which
nothing
small
for
sleep
in
be
ever
make
except
coffin
,
it
be
no
big
than
one
of
those
hackney
cabriolet
which
have
the
door
behind
,
and
shoot
their
fare
out
,
like
sack
of
coal
,
upon
the
pavement
.
   
<EOS>
have
settle
this
point
to
the
perfect
satisfaction
of
all
party
,
concerned
and
unconcerned
,
we
sit
down
round
the
fire
in
the
lady
'
cabin
---
just
to
try
the
effect
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
rather
dark
,
certainly
;
but
somebody
say
,
"
of
course
it
would
be
light
,
at
sea
,
"
a
proposition
to
which
we
all
assent
;
echo
"
of
course
,
of
course
;
"
though
it
would
be
exceedingly
difficult
to
say
why
we
think
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
,
too
,
when
we
have
discover
and
exhaust
another
topic
of
consolation
in
the
circumstance
of
this
lady
'
cabin
adjoin
our
state
-
room
,
and
the
consequently
immense
feasibility
of
sit
there
at
all
time
and
season
,
and
have
fall
into
a
momentary
silence
,
lean
our
face
on
our
hand
and
look
at
the
fire
,
one
of
our
party
say
,
with
the
solemn
air
of
a
man
who
have
make
a
discovery
,
"
what
a
relish
mull
claret
will
have
down
here
!
"
<EOS>
which
appear
to
strike
us
all
most
forcibly
;
as
though
there
be
something
spicy
and
high
-
flavour
in
cabin
,
which
essentially
improve
that
composition
,
and
render
it
quite
incapable
of
perfection
anywhere
else
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
stewardess
,
too
,
actively
engage
in
produce
clean
sheet
and
table
-
cloth
from
the
very
entrail
of
the
sofa
,
and
from
unexpected
locker
,
of
such
artful
mechanism
,
that
it
make
one
's
head
ache
to
see
them
open
one
after
another
,
and
render
it
quite
a
distract
circumstance
to
follow
her
proceeding
,
and
to
find
that
every
nook
and
corner
and
individual
piece
of
furniture
be
something
else
besides
what
it
pretend
to
be
,
and
be
a
mere
trap
and
deception
and
place
of
secret
stowage
,
<EOS>
whose
ostensible
purpose
be
its
least
useful
one
.
   
<EOS>
God
bless
that
stewardess
for
her
piously
fraudulent
account
of
January
voyage
!
 
<EOS>
God
bless
her
for
her
clear
recollection
of
the
companion
passage
of
last
year
,
when
nobody
be
ill
,
and
everybody
dance
from
morning
to
night
,
and
it
be
"
a
run
"
of
twelve
day
,
and
a
piece
of
the
pure
frolic
,
and
delight
,
and
jollity
!
 
<EOS>
all
happiness
be
with
her
for
her
bright
face
and
her
pleasant
Scotch
tongue
,
which
have
sound
of
old
Home
in
it
for
my
fellow
-
traveller
;
and
for
her
prediction
of
fair
wind
and
fine
weather
(
all
wrong
,
or
I
should
not
be
half
so
fond
of
her
)
;
and
for
the
ten
thousand
small
fragment
of
genuine
womanly
tact
,
by
which
,
without
piece
them
elaborately
together
,
and
patch
them
up
into
shape
and
form
and
case
and
pointed
application
,
she
nevertheless
do
plainly
show
that
all
young
mother
on
one
side
of
the
Atlantic
be
near
and
close
at
hand
to
their
little
child
leave
upon
the
other
;
and
that
what
seem
to
the
uninitiated
a
serious
journey
,
be
,
to
those
who
be
in
the
secret
,
a
mere
frolic
,
to
be
sing
about
and
whistle
at
!
 
<EOS>
light
be
her
heart
,
and
gay
her
merry
eye
,
for
year
!
   
<EOS>
the
state
-
room
have
grow
pretty
fast
;
but
by
this
time
it
have
expand
into
something
quite
bulky
,
and
almost
boast
a
bay
-
window
to
view
the
sea
from
.
 
<EOS>
so
we
go
upon
deck
again
in
high
spirit
;
and
there
,
everything
be
in
such
a
state
of
bustle
and
active
preparation
,
that
the
blood
quicken
its
pace
,
and
whirl
through
one
's
vein
on
that
clear
frosty
morning
with
involuntary
mirthfulness
.
 
<EOS>
for
every
gallant
ship
be
ride
slowly
up
and
down
,
and
every
little
boat
be
splash
noisily
in
the
water
;
and
knot
of
people
stand
upon
the
wharf
,
gaze
with
a
kind
of
"
dread
delight
"
on
the
far
-
famed
fast
american
steamer
;
and
one
party
of
man
be
"
take
in
the
milk
,
"
or
,
in
other
word
,
get
the
cow
on
board
;
and
another
be
fill
the
icehouse
to
the
very
throat
with
fresh
provision
;
with
butchers'-meat
and
garden
-
stuff
,
pale
sucking
-
pig
,
calf
'
head
in
score
,
beef
,
veal
,
and
pork
,
and
poultry
out
of
all
proportion
;
and
other
be
coil
rope
and
busy
with
oakum
yarns
;
and
other
be
lower
heavy
package
into
the
hold
;
and
the
purser
's
head
be
barely
visible
as
it
loom
in
a
state
,
of
exquisite
perplexity
from
the
midst
of
a
vast
pile
of
passenger
'
luggage
;
and
there
seem
to
be
nothing
go
on
anywhere
,
or
uppermost
in
the
mind
of
anybody
,
but
preparation
for
this
mighty
voyage
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
with
the
bright
cold
sun
,
the
bracing
air
,
the
crisply
-
curl
water
,
the
thin
white
crust
of
morning
ice
upon
the
deck
which
crackle
with
a
sharp
and
cheerful
sound
beneath
the
light
tread
,
be
irresistible
.
 
<EOS>
and
when
,
again
upon
the
shore
,
we
turn
and
see
from
the
vessel
's
mast
her
name
signal
in
flag
of
joyous
colour
,
and
flutter
by
their
side
the
beautiful
american
banner
with
its
star
and
stripe
,
---
the
long
three
thousand
mile
and
more
,
and
,
longer
still
,
the
six
whole
month
of
absence
,
so
dwindle
and
fade
,
that
the
ship
have
go
out
and
come
home
again
,
and
<EOS>
it
be
broad
spring
already
in
the
Coburg
Dock
at
Liverpool
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
not
inquire
among
my
medical
acquaintance
,
whether
Turtle
,
and
cold
Punch
,
with
Hock
,
Champagne
,
and
Claret
,
and
all
the
slight
et
cetera
usually
include
in
an
unlimited
order
for
a
good
dinner
---
especially
when
it
be
leave
to
the
liberal
construction
of
my
faultless
friend
,
Mr
Radley
,
of
the
Adelphi
Hotel
---
be
peculiarly
calculate
to
suffer
a
sea
-
change
;
or
whether
a
plain
mutton
-
chop
,
and
a
glass
or
two
of
sherry
,
would
be
less
likely
of
conversion
into
foreign
and
disconcert
material
.
 
<EOS>
My
own
opinion
be
,
that
whether
one
be
discreet
or
indiscreet
in
these
particular
,
on
the
eve
of
a
sea
-
voyage
,
be
a
matter
of
little
consequence
;
and
that
,
to
use
a
common
phrase
,
"
it
come
to
very
much
the
same
thing
in
the
end
.
"
 
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
may
<EOS>
,
I
know
that
the
dinner
of
that
day
be
undeniably
perfect
;
that
it
comprehend
all
these
item
,
and
a
great
many
more
;
and
that
we
all
do
ample
justice
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
know
too
,
that
,
bate
a
certain
tacit
avoidance
of
any
allusion
to
to
-
morrow
;
such
as
may
be
suppose
to
prevail
between
delicate
-
minded
turnkey
,
and
a
sensitive
prisoner
who
be
to
be
hang
next
morning
;
we
get
on
very
well
,
and
,
all
thing
consider
,
be
merry
enough
.
   
<EOS>
when
the
morning
---
the
morning
---
come
,
and
we
meet
at
breakfast
,
it
be
curious
to
see
how
eager
we
all
be
to
prevent
a
moment
's
pause
in
the
conversation
,
and
how
astoundingly
gay
everybody
be
:
the
force
spirit
of
each
member
of
the
little
party
have
as
much
likeness
to
his
natural
mirth
,
as
hot

house
pea
at
five
guinea
the
quart
,
resemble
in
flavour
the
growth
of
the
dew
,
and

of
Heaven

<EOS>
but
as
one
o'clock
,
the
hour
for
go
aboard

draw
near

this
volubility
dwindle
away
by
little
and
little
,
despite
the
most
persevere
effort
to
the
contrary
,
until
at
last
,
the
matter
be
now
quite
desperate
,
we
throw
off
all
disguise
;
openly
speculate
upon
where
we
should
be
this
time
to
-
morrow
,
this
time
next
day
,
and
so
forth
;
and
entrust
a
vast
number
of
message
to
those
who
intend
return
to
town
that
night
,
which
be
to
be
deliver
at
home
and
elsewhere
without
fail
,
within
the
very
short
possible
space
of
time
after
the
arrival
of
the
railway
train
at
Euston
Square
.
 
<EOS>
and
commission
and
remembrance
do
so
crowd
upon
one
at
such
a
time
,
that
we
be
still
busied
with
this
employment
when
we
find
ourselves
fuse
,
as
it
be
,
into
a
dense
conglomeration
of
passenger
and
passenger
'
friend
and
passenger
'
luggage
,
all
jumble
together
on
the
deck
of
a
small
steamboat
,
and
pant
and
snort
off
to
the
packet
,
which
have
work
out
of

yesterday
afternoon
and

<EOS>
all

to
where
she

dimly
discernible
through
the
gather
fog
of
the
early
winter
afternoon

every

in
the

and

of

his

in

who

dispense
so
much
consolation
by
inquire
with
a
yawn
of
another
gentleman
whether
he
be
"

as
if
it
be
a

even
he
condescend
to
look
that
way

and
nod
his
head
,
as
who
should
say
,
"
no

and

the
sage
Lord
Burleigh

half
so

this
lazy

of

the

(
as
everybody

out
already
;
it
be
impossible
to

how

thirteen
time
without
a
single

<EOS>
there
be
another
passenger
very
much
wrap

up
,
who
have
be
frown
down
by
the
rest
,
and
morally
trample
upon
and
crush

for
presume
to
inquire
with
a
timid
interest
how
long
it
be
since
the
poor
President
go
down
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
stand
close
to
the
lazy
gentleman
,
and
say
with
a
faint
smile
that
he
believe
She
be
a
very
strong
ship
;
to
which
the
lazy
gentleman
,
look
first
in
his
questioner
's
eye
and
then
very
hard
in
the
wind

,
answer
unexpectedly
and
ominously
,
that
She

<EOS>
upon
this
the
lazy
gentleman
instantly
fall
very
low
in
the
popular
estimation
,
and
the
passenger
,
with
look
of
defiance
,
whisper
to
each
other
that
he
be
an
ass
,
and
an
impostor
,
and
clearly
do
not
know
anything
at
all
about
it

we

in

beset
and

by
its

pervade
the
whole

and
be
to

with
by
the
dozen
in
every
nook

corner

swarm
down
below
with
their
own
baggage

and
stumble
over
other

;
dispose
themselves
comfortably
in
wrong
cabin
,
and
create
a
most
horrible
confusion
by
have
to
turn
out
again
;
madly
bent
upon
open

and
on
force
a
passage
into
all
kind
of
out

of

place
where

send
wild
steward

with
elfin

to

upon
the
breezy
deck
on
unintelligible
errand
,
impossible
of
execution

and
in
short
,
create
the
most
extraordinary
and
bewildering
tumult
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
all
this

the
lazy

who
seem
to
have
no

of

kind

not
so
much
as
a

even
<EOS>

lounge
up

down
the
hurricane
deck
,
coolly
puff
a
cigar
;
and

unconcerned
demeanour

exalt
him
in

this

<EOS>
if
we
could
have
go
off
in
the

of
that
last

we
should
have
start
triumphantly
:

two

neither

It

three

ring
upon

the

throb
like
a
strong

that

just

the
breath
of
life
;
the
two
great

turn
fiercely

Chapter
02
.
<EOS>
the
Passage
out
 
<EOS>
we
all
dine
together
that
day
;
and
a
rather
formidable
party
<EOS>
we
be
:
 
no
few
than
eighty
-
six
strong
.
 
<EOS>
the
vessel
be
pretty
deep
in
the
water
,
with
all
her
coal
on
board
and
so
many
passenger
,
and
the
weather
be
calm
and
quiet
,
there
be
but
little
motion
;
so
that
before
the
dinner
be
half
over
,
even
those
passenger
who
be
most
distrustful
of
themselves
pluck
up
amazingly
;
and
those
who
in
the
morning
have
return
to
the
universal
question
,
<EOS>
"
be
you
a
good
sailor
?
"
<EOS>
a
very
decide
negative
,
now
either
parry
the
inquiry
with
the
evasive
reply
,
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
be
no
bad
than
anybody
else
;
"
or
,
reckless
of
all
moral
obligation
,
answer
boldly
"
<EOS>
yes
:
"
and
with
some
irritation
too
,
as
though
they
would
add
,
"
I
should
like
to
know
what
you
see
in
ME
,
sir
,
particularly
,
to
justify
suspicion
!
"
   
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
high
tone
of
courage
and
confidence
,
I
could
not
but
observe
that
very
few
remain
long
over
their
wine
;
and
that
everybody
have
an
unusual
love
of
the
open
air
;
and
that
the
favourite
and
most
covet
seat
be
invariably
those
near
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
the
tea
-
table
,
too
,
be
by
no
mean
as
well
attend
as
the
dinner
-
table
;
and
there
be
less
whist
-
playing
than
may
have
be
expect
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
with
the
exception
of
one
lady
,
who
have
retire
with
some
precipitation
at
dinner
-
time
,
immediately
after
be
assist
to
the
fine
cut
of
a
very
yellow
boil
leg
of
mutton
with
very
green
caper
,
there
be
no
invalid
as
yet
;
and
walk
,
and
smoking
,
and
drinking
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
(
but
always
in
the
open
air
)
,
go
on
with
unabated
spirit
,
until
eleven
o'clock
or
thereabout
,
when
"
turn
in
"
---
no
sailor
of
seven
hour
'
experience
talk
of
go
to
bed
---
become
the
order
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
the
perpetual
tramp
of
boot
-
heel
on
the
deck
give
place
to
a
heavy
silence
,
and
the
whole
human
freight
be
stow
away
below
,
except
a
very
few
straggler
,
like
myself
,
who
be
probably
,
like
me
,
afraid
to
go
there
.
   
<EOS>
to
one
unaccustomed
to
such
scene
,
this
be
a
very
striking
time
on
shipboard
.
 
<EOS>
afterwards
,
and
when
its
novelty
have
long
wear
off
,
it
never
cease
to
have
a
peculiar
interest
and
charm
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
the
gloom
through
which
the
great
black
mass
hold
its
direct
and
certain
course
<EOS>
;
the
rush

plainly

,
but
dimly

;
the
broad

white

glisten
track

that
follow
in
the
vessel

wake
;
the
man
on
the
look

out
forward
,
who
would
be
scarcely
visible
against
the
dark
sky
,
but
for
their
blotting
out
some
score
of
glisten
star
;
the
helmsman
at
the
wheel
,
with
the
illuminate
card
before
him
,
shine
,
a
speck
of
light
amidst
the
darkness
,
like
something
sentient
and
of
divine
intelligence
;
the
melancholy
sighing
of
the
wind
through
block
,
and
rope
,
and
chain
;
the
gleaming
forth
of
light
from
every
crevice
,
nook
,
and
tiny
piece
of
glass
about
the
deck
,
as
though
the
ship
be
fill
with
fire
in
hiding
,
ready
to
burst
through
any
outlet
,
wild
with
its
resistless
power
of
death

ruin

<EOS>
at
first
,
too
,
and
even
when
the
hour
,
and
all
the

exalt

have
come
to
be
familiar

it

difficult

alone

<EOS>
They
change

exceed

it

me

suddenly
out

My

on

<EOS>
It

not
exactly
comfortable
below

<EOS>
It
be
decidedly
close

and
it
be
impossible
to
be
unconscious
of
the
presence
of
that
extraordinary
compound
of
strange
smell
,
which
be
to
be
find
nowhere
but
on

and
which
be
such
a
subtle
perfume
that
it
seem
to
enter
at
every
pore
of

and
whisper
of

<EOS>
two
passenger

(
one

lie
already
in
silent

on

one

<EOS>
(
my

execrate

<EOS>
everything
slope
the
wrong
way
:
which
in
itself
be
an
aggravation
scarcely

<EOS>
I
have
leave
the

open

a
moment
before
,
in
the
bosom
of
a
gentle
declivity

and
,
when
I
turn
to
shut
it

it

on

summit

now
every

creak

crackle

<EOS>
there
be
nothing
for

so
I
go

It

pretty

the

the
next
two
day

with
a
tolerably
fair

<EOS>
I
read
in

<EOS>
(
but
to
this
hour
I
do
not
know

<EOS>
a
good
deal
;
and
reel
on

a
little
;
drank
cold
brandy

water
with
an
unspeakable
disgust

and
eat
hard

perseveringly

not
ill

go

<EOS>
It
be
the
third

I
be
awaken
out

by
a
dismal

<EOS>
I
rouse
myself
,
and
look
out
of
bed
.
 
<EOS>
the
water
-
jug
be
plunge
and
leap
like
a
lively
dolphin
;
all
the
small
article
be
afloat
,
except
my
shoe
,
which
be
strand
on
a
carpet
-
bag
,
high
and
dry
,
like
a
couple
of
coal
-
barge
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
I
see
them
spring
into
the
air
,
and
behold
the
looking
-
glass
,
which
be
nail
to
the
wall
,
stick
fast
upon
the
ceiling
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
the
door
entirely
disappear
,
and
a
new
one
be
open
in
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
begin
to
comprehend
that
the
state

room
be
stand
on
its
head

<EOS>
before
it
be
possible
to
make
any
arrangement
at
all
compatible
with
this
novel
state
of
thing
,
the
ship
right
.
 
<EOS>
before
one
can
say
"
Thank
Heaven
!
"
<EOS>
she
wrong
again
.
 
<EOS>
before
one
can
cry
she
be
wrong
,
she
seem
to
have
start
forward
,
and
to
be
a
creature
actually
run
of
its
own
accord
,
with
broken
knee
and
fail
leg
,
through
every
variety
of
hole
and
pitfall
,
and
stumble
constantly
.
 
<EOS>
before
one
can
so
much
as
wonder
,
she
take
a
high
leap
into
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
before
she
have
well
do
that
,
she
take
a
deep
dive
into
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
before
she
have
gain
the
surface
,
she
throw
a
summerset
.
 
<EOS>
the
instant
<EOS>
she
be
on
her
leg
,
she
rush
backward
.
<EOS>
and
so
she
go
on
staggering
,
heaving
,
wrestling
,
leaping
,
diving
,
jumping
,
pitching
,
throbbing
,
rolling

and
rock

and
go
through
all
these
movement

sometimes
by
turn

and
sometimes
altogether

feel
dispose
to
roar
for

<EOS>
a

<EOS>
"
Steward

"
 
<EOS>
"
Sir

"
 
<EOS>

what
be
the

<EOS>
what
do
you
call
this

"
 
<EOS>
"
rather
a
heavy
sea
on
,
sir
,
and
a
head
-
wind
.
"
   
<EOS>
a
head
-
wind
!
 
<EOS>
imagine
a
human
face
upon
the
vessel
's
prow
,
with
fifteen
thousand
samson
in
one
bent
upon
drive
her
back
,
and
hit
her
exactly
between
the
eye
<EOS>
whenever
she
attempt
to
advance
an
inch
.
 
<EOS>
imagine
the
ship
herself
,
with
every
pulse
and
artery
of
her
huge
body
swell
and
burst
under
this
maltreatment
,
swear
to
go
on
or
die
.
 
<EOS>
imagine
the
wind
howling
,
the
sea
roaring
,
<EOS>
the
rain
beat
:
 
all
in
furious
array
against
her
.
<EOS>
picture
the
sky
both
dark
and
wild
,
and
the
cloud
,
in
fearful
sympathy
with
the
wave
,
make
another
ocean
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
add
to
all
this
,
the
clatter
on
deck
and
down
below
<EOS>
;
the
tread
of
hurried
foot
;
the
loud
hoarse
shout
of
seaman
;
the
gurgling
in
and
out
of
water
through
the
scupper
;
with
,
every
now
and
then
,
the
striking
of
a
heavy
sea
upon
the
plank
above
,
with
the
deep
,
dead
,
heavy
sound
of
thunder
hear
within
a
vault
;
---
and
there
be
the
head
-
wind
of
that
January
morning
.
   
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
of
what
may
be
call
the
domestic
noise
of
the
ship
:
 
such
as
the
breaking
of
glass
and
crockery
,
the
tumble
down
of
steward
,
the
gambol
,
overhead
,
of
loose
cask
and
truant
dozen
of
bottled
porter
,
and
the
very
remarkable
and
far
from
exhilarate
sound
raise
in
their
various
state
-
room
by
the
seventy
passenger
who
be
too
ill
to
get
up
to
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
of
them
:
 
for
although
I
lie
listen
to
this
concert
for
three
or
four
day
,
I
do
not
think
I
hear
it
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
minute
,
<EOS>
at
the
expiration
of
which
term
,
I
lie
down
again
,
excessively
sea
-
sick
.
   
<EOS>
not
sea
-
sick
,
be
it
understand
,
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
the
term
:
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
be
:
 
<EOS>
but
in
a
form
which
I
have
never
see
or
hear
describe
,
though
I
have
no
doubt
it
be
very
common
.
 
<EOS>
I
lie
there
,
all
the
day
long
,
quite
coolly
and
contentedly
;
with
no
sense
of
weariness
,
with
no
desire
to
get
up
,
or
get
well
,
or
take
the
air
;
with
no
curiosity
,
or
care
,
or
regret
,
of
any
sort
or
degree
,
save
that
I
think
I
can
remember
,
in
this
universal
indifference
,
have
a
kind
of
lazy
joy
---
of
fiendish
delight
,
if
anything
so
lethargic
can
be
dignified
with
the
title
---
in
the
fact
of
my
wife
be
too
ill
to
talk
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
may
be
allow
to
illustrate
my
state
of
mind
by
such
an
example
,
I
should
say
that
I
be
exactly
in
the
condition
of
the
elder
Mr
Willet
,
after
the
incursion
of
the
rioter
into
his
bar
at
Chigwell
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
would
have
surprise
me
.
 
<EOS>
if
,
in
the
momentary
illumination
of
any
ray
of
intelligence
that
may
have
come
upon
me
in
the
way
of
thought
of
Home
,
a
goblin
postman
,
with
a
scarlet
coat
and
bell
,
have
come
into
that
little
kennel
before
me
,
broad
awake
in
broad
day
,
and
,
apologise
for
be
damp
through
walk
in
the
sea
,
have
hand
me
a
letter
direct
to
myself
,
in
familiar
character
,
I
be
certain
I
should
not
have
feel
one
atom
of
astonishment
:
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
be
perfectly
satisfy
.
 
<EOS>
if
Neptune
himself
have
walk
in
,
with
a
toast
shark
on
his
trident
,
I
should
have
look
upon
the
event
as
one
of
the
very
common
everyday
occurrence
.
   
<EOS>
once
---
once
---
I
find
myself
on
deck
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
I
get
there
,
or
what
possess
me
to
go
there
,
but
there
I
be
;
and
completely
dress
too
,
with
a
huge
pea
-
coat
on
,
and
<EOS>
a
pair
of
boot
such
as
no
weak
man
in
his
sense
could
ever
have
get
into
.
<EOS>
I
find
myself
stand
,
when
a
gleam
of
consciousness
come
upon
me
,
hold
on
to
something
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
be
the
boatswain
:
 
or
it
may
have
be
the
pump
:
 
or
possibly
the
cow
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
how
long
I
have
be
there
;
whether
a
day
or
a
minute
.
<EOS>
I
recollect
try
to
think
about
something
(
about
anything
in
the
whole
wide
world
,
I
be
not
particular
)
without
the
small
effect
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
even
make
out
which
be
the
sea
,
and
which
<EOS>
the
sky
,
for
the
horizon
seem
drunk
,
and
be
fly
wildly
about
in
all
direction
.
 
<EOS>
even
in
that
incapable
state
,
however
,
I
recognise
the
lazy
gentleman
stand
before
me
:
 
nautically
clothe
in
a
suit
of
shaggy
blue
,
with
an
oilskin
hat
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
too
imbecile
,
although
I
know
it
to
be
he
,
to
separate
him
from
his
dress
;
and
try
to
call
him
<EOS>
,
I
remember
,
PILOT
.
 
<EOS>
after
another
interval
of
total
unconsciousness
,
I
find
he
have
go
,
and
recognise
another
figure
in
its
place
.
 
<EOS>
It
seem
to
wave
and
fluctuate
before
me
as
though
I
see
it
reflect
in
an
unsteady
looking
-
glass
;
but
I
know
it
for
the
captain
;
and
such
be
the
cheerful
influence
of
his
face
,
that
I
try
to
smile
:
 
<EOS>
yes
,
even
then
I
try
to
smile
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
by
his
gesture
that
he
address
me
;
but
it
be
a
long
time
before
I
could
make
out
that
he
remonstrate
against
my
standing
up
to
my
knee
in
water
---
as
I
be
;
of
course
I
do
not
know
why
.
 
<EOS>
I
try
to
thank
him
,
but
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
only
point
to
my
boot
---
or
<EOS>
wherever
I
suppose
my
boot
to
be
---
and
say
in
a
plaintive
voice
,
"
cork
sole
:
"
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
endeavour
,
I
be
tell
,
to
sit
down
in
the
pool
.
 
<EOS>
find
that
I
be
quite
insensible
,
and
for
the
time
a
maniac
,
he
humanely
conduct
me
below
.
   
<EOS>
there
I
remain
until
I
get
better
:
 
suffering
,
whenever
I
be
recommend
to
eat
anything
,
an
amount
of
anguish
only
second
to
that
which
be
say
to
be
endure
by
the
apparently
drown
,
in
the
process
of
restoration
to
life
.
 
<EOS>
one
gentleman
on
board
have
a
letter
of
introduction
to
me
from
a
mutual
friend
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
He
send
it
below
with
his
card
,
on
the
morning
of
the
head
-
wind
;
and
I
be
long
trouble
with
the
idea
that
he
may
be
up
,
and
well
,
and
a
hundred
time
a
day
expect
me
to
call
upon
him
in
the
saloon
.
<EOS>
I
imagine
him
one
of
those
cast
-
iron
image
---
I
will
not
call
them
man
---
who
ask
,
with
red
face
,
and
lusty
voice
,
what
sea
-
sickness
mean
,
and
whether
it
really
be
as
bad
as
it
be
represent
to
be
.
<EOS>
this
be
very
torturing
indeed
;
and
I
do
not
think
I
ever
feel
such
perfect
gratification
and
gratitude
of
heart
,
as
I
do
when
I
hear
from
the
ship
's
doctor
that
he
have
be
oblige
to
put
a
large
mustard
poultice
on
this
very
gentleman
's
stomach
.
 
<EOS>
I
date
my
recovery
from
the
receipt
of
that
intelligence
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
materially
assist
though
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
by
a
heavy
gale
of
wind
,
which
come
slowly
up
at
sunset
,
when
we
be
about
ten
day
out
,
and
rage
with
gradually
increase
fury
until
morning
,
save
that
it
lull
for
an
hour
a
little
before
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
the
unnatural
repose
of
that
hour
,
and
in
the
after
gathering
of
the
storm
,
so
inconceivably
awful
and
tremendous
,
that
its
bursting
into
full
violence
be
almost
a
relief
.
   
<EOS>
the
labouring
of
the
ship
in
the
troubled
sea
on
this
night
I
shall
never
forget
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
it
ever
be
bad
than
this
?
<EOS>
"
be
a
question
I
have
often
hear
ask
,
when
everything
be
slide
and
bump
about
,
and
when
it
certainly
do
seem
difficult
to
comprehend
the
possibility
of
anything
afloat
be
more
disturbed
,
without
topple
over
and
go
down
.
 
<EOS>
but
what
the
agitation
of
a
steam
-
vessel
be
,
on
a
bad
winter
's
night
in
the
wild
Atlantic
,
it
be
impossible
for
the
most
vivid
imagination
to
conceive
.
 
<EOS>
to
say
that
she
be
fling
down
on
her
side
in
the
wave
,
with
her
mast
dip
into
them
,
and
that
,
spring
up
again
,
she
roll
over
on
the
other
side
,
until
a
heavy
sea
strike
her
with
the
noise
of
a
hundred
great
gun
,
and
hurls
her
back
---
that
she
stop
,
and
stagger
,
and
shiver
,
as
though
stunned
,
and
then
,
with
a
violent
throbbing
at
her
heart
,
dart
onward
like
a
monster
goad
into
madness
,
to
be
beat
down
,
and
batter
,
and
crush
,
and
leap
on
by
the
angry
sea
---
that
thunder
,
lightning
,
hail
,
and
rain
,
and
wind
,
be
all
in
fierce
contention
for
the
mastery
---
that
every
plank
have
its
groan
,
<EOS>
every
nail
its
shriek
,
and
every
drop
of
water
in
the
great
ocean
its
howling
voice
---
be
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
to
say
that
all
be
grand
,
and
all
appalling
and
horrible
in
the
last
degree
,
be
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
word
can
not
express
it
.
 
<EOS>
thought
can
not
convey
it
.
<EOS>
only
a
dream
can
call
it
up
again
,
in
all
its
fury
,
rage
,
and
passion
.
   
<EOS>
and
yet
,
in
the
very
midst
of
these
terror
,
I
be
place
in
a
situation
so
exquisitely
ridiculous
,
that
even
then
I
have
as
strong
a
sense
of
its
absurdity
as
I
have
now
,
and
could
no
more
help
laugh
than
I
can
at
any
other
comical
incident
,
happen
under
circumstance
the
most
favourable
to
its
enjoyment
.
 
<EOS>
about
midnight
we
ship
a
sea
,
which
force
its
way
through
the
skylight
,
<EOS>
burst
open
the
door
above
,
and
come
rage
and
roar
down
into
the
lady
'
cabin
,
to
the
unspeakable
consternation
of
my
wife
and
a
little
Scotch
lady
---
who
,
by
the
way
,
have
previously
send
a
message
to
the
captain
by
the
stewardess
,
request
him
,
with
her
compliment
,
to
have
a
steel
conductor
immediately
attach
to
the
top
of
every
mast
,
and
to
the
chimney
,
in
order
that
the
ship
may
not
be
strike
by
lightning
.
 
<EOS>
They
and
the
handmaid
before
mention
,
be
in
such
ecstasy
of
fear
<EOS>
that
I
scarcely
know
what
to
do
with
them
,
I
naturally
bethought
myself
of
some
restorative
or
comfortable
cordial
;
and
nothing
well
occur
to
me
,
at
the
moment
,
than
hot
brandy
-
and
-
water
<EOS>
,
I
procure
a
tumbler
full
without
delay
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
stand
or
sit
without
hold
on
,
they
be
all
heap
together
in
one
corner
of
a
long
sofa
---
a
fixture
extend
entirely
across
the
cabin
---
where
they
cling
to
each
other
in
momentary
expectation
of
be
drown
.
<EOS>
when
I
approach
this
place
with
my
specific
,
and
be
about
to
administer
it
with
many
consolatory
expression
to
the
near
sufferer
,
what
be
my
dismay
to
see
them
all
roll
slowly
down
to
the
other
end
!
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
stagger
to
that
end
,
and
hold
out
the
glass
once
more
,
how
immensely
baffle
be
my
good
intention
by
the
ship
give
another
lurch
,
and
their
all
roll
back
again
!
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
dodge
them
up
and
down
this
sofa
for
at
least
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
without
reach
them
once
;
and
by
the
time
I
do
catch
them
,
the
brandy
-
and
-
water
be
diminish
,
by
constant
spilling
,
to
a
teaspoonful
.
 
<EOS>
to
complete
the
group
,
it
be
necessary
to
recognise
in
this
disconcert
dodger
,
an
individual
very
pale
from
sea
-
sickness
,
who
have

a

of

<EOS>
of
the
outrageous

perform

which
make
bed
a
practical
joke
,
and
get
up
,
by
any
process
short
of
fall
out
,
an
impossibility
;
I
say
nothing

<EOS>
but
anything
like
the
utter
dreariness
and
desolation
that
meet
my
eye
when
I
literally
"
tumble
up
"
on
deck
at
noon

I
never

<EOS>
ocean
and

be
all
of

dull

heavy

uniform

lead

<EOS>
there
be
no
extent
of
prospect
even
over
the
dreary
waste
that
lie
around
us
,
for
the
sea
run
high
,
and
the
horizon
encompass
us
like
a
large
black
hoop
.
 
<EOS>
view
from
the
air
,
or
some
tall
bluff
on
shore
,
it
would
have
be
impose
and
stupendous
,
no
doubt
;
but
see
from
the
wet
and
rolling
deck
,
it
only
impress
one
giddily
and
painfully
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
gale
of
last
night
the
life
-
boat
have
be
crush
by
one
blow
of
the
sea
like
a
walnut

shell

and
there
it
hang
dangle
in
the

a
mere
faggot
of
crazy
board

<EOS>
the

of

be
tear
sheer
away
.
 
<EOS>
the

their

about
the

Chimney

<EOS>
;

a

it

<EOS>
I
be
now
comfortably
establish
by
courtesy
in
the
lady
'
cabin
,
<EOS>
where
,
besides
ourselves
,
there
be
only
four
other
passenger
.
<EOS>
first
,
the
little
Scotch
lady
before
mention
,
on
her
way
to
join
her
husband
at
New
York
,
who
have
settle
there
three
year
before
.
<EOS>
secondly
and
thirdly
,
an
honest
young
Yorkshireman
,
connect
with
some
american
house
;
domicile
in
that
same
city
,
and
carry
thither
his
beautiful
young
wife
to
whom
he
have
be
marry
but
a
fortnight
,
and
who
be
the
fair
speciman
of
a
comely
english
country
girl
I
have
ever
see
.
 
<EOS>
fourthly
,
fifthly
,
and
lastly
,
another
couple
:
 
newly
marry
too
,
if
one
may
judge
from
the
endearment
they
frequently
interchange
:
 
of
whom
I
know
no
more
than
that
they
be
rather
a
mysterious
,
run
-
away
kind
of
couple
;
that
the
lady
have
great
personal
attraction
also
;
and
that
the
gentleman
carry
more
gun
with
him
than
Robinson
Crusoe
,
wear
a
shooting
-
coat
,
and
have
two
great
dog
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
on
further
consideration
,
I
remember
that
he
try
hot
roast
pig
and
bottle
ale
as
a
cure
for
sea
-
sickness
;
and
that
he
take
these
remedy
(
usually
in
bed
)
day
after
day
,
with
astonishing
perseverance
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
add
,
for
the
information
of
the
curious
,
that
they
decidedly
fail
.
   
<EOS>
the
weather
continue
obstinately
and
almost
unprecedentedly
bad
,
we
usually
straggle
into
this
cabin
,
more
or
less
faint
and
miserable
,
about
an
hour
before
noon
,
and
lie
down
on
the
sofa
to
recover
;
during
which
interval
,
the
captain
would
look
in
to
communicate
the
state
of
the
wind
,
the
moral
certainty
of
its
change
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
(
the
weather
be
always
go
to
improve
to

morrow
,
at

)
,
the
vessel

rate
of
sailing
,
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
observation
there
be
none
to
tell
us
of
,
for
there
be
no
sun
to
take
them
by
.
 
<EOS>
but
a
description
of
one
day
will
serve
for
all
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
here
it
be
.
   
<EOS>
the
captain
be
go
,
we
compose
ourselves
to
read
,
if
the
place
be
light
enough
;
and
if
not
,
we
doze
and
talk
alternately
.
 
<EOS>
at
one
,
a
bell
ring
,
and
the
stewardess
come
down
with
a
steam
dish
of
baked
potato
,
and
another
of
roasted
apple
;
and
plate
of
pig
's
face
,
cold
ham
,
salt
beef
;
or
perhaps
a
smoking
mess
of
rare
hot
collop
.
 
<EOS>
We
fall
to
upon
these
dainty
;
eat
as
much
as
we
can
(
we
have
great
appetite
now
)
;
and
be
as
long
as
possible
about
it
.
<EOS>
if
the
fire
will
burn
(
it
WILL
sometimes
)
<EOS>
we
be
pretty
cheerful
.
<EOS>
if
it
will
not
,
we
all
remark
to
each
other
that
it
be
very
cold
,
rub
our
hand
,
cover
ourselves
with
coat
and
cloak
,
and
lie
down
again
to
doze
,
talk
,
and
read
(
provide
as
aforesaid
)
,
until
dinner
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
at
five
,
another
bell
ring
,
and
the
stewardess
reappear
with
another
dish
of
potato
---
boil
this
time
---
and
store
of
hot
meat
of
various
kind
:
 
not
forget
the
roast
pig
,
to
be
take
medicinally
.
 
<EOS>
We
sit
down
at
table
again
(
rather
more
cheerfully
than
before
)
;
prolong
the
meal
with
a
rather
mouldy
dessert
of
apple
,
grape
,
and
orange
;
and
drink
our
wine
and
brandy
-
and
-
water
.
 
<EOS>
the
bottle
and
glass
be
still
upon
the
table
,
and
the
orange
and
so
forth
be
roll
about
accord
to
their
fancy
and
the
ship
's
way
,
when
the
doctor
come
down
,
by
special
nightly
invitation
,
to
join
our
evening
rubber
:
immediately
on
whose
arrival
we
make
a
party
at
whist
,
and
as
it
be
a
rough
night
and
the
card
will
not
lie
on
the
cloth
,
we
put
the
trick
in
our
pocket
as
we
take
them
.
 
<EOS>
at
whist
we
remain
with
exemplary
gravity
(
deduct
a
short
time
for
tea
and
toast
)
until
eleven
o'clock
,
or
thereabout
;
when
the
captain
come
down
again
,
in
a
sou'-wester
hat
tie
under
his
chin
,
and
a
pilot
-
coat
:
 
make
the
ground
wet
where
he
stand
.
 
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
card
-
playing
be
over
,
and
the
bottle
and
glass
be
again
upon
the
table
;
and
after
an
hour
's
pleasant
conversation
about
the
ship
,
the
passenger
,
and
thing
in
general
,
the
captain
(
who
never
go
to
bed
,
and
be
never
out
of
humour
)
turn
up
his
coat
collar
for
the
deck
again
;
shake
hand
all
round
;
and
go
laugh
out
into
the
weather
as
merrily
as
to
a
birthday
party
.
   
<EOS>
as
to
daily
news
,
there
be
no
dearth
of
that
commodity
.
 
<EOS>
this
passenger
be
report
to
have
lose
fourteen
pound
at
Vingt

et

un
in
the
saloon
yesterday
;
and
that
passenger
drink
his
bottle
of
champagne
every
day
,
and
how
he
do
it
(
be
only
a
clerk
)
,
nobody
know
.
 
<EOS>
the
head
engineer
have
distinctly
say
that
there
never
be
such
time
---
mean
weather

and
four
good

ill

and
have

<EOS>
several
berth

full
of

<EOS>
the

and
have
be

<EOS>
all
the

fall
down

and

<EOS>
News
!
 
<EOS>
a
dozen
murder
on
shore
would
lack
the
interest
of
these
slight
incident
at
sea
.
   
<EOS>
divide
between
our
rubber
and
such
topic
as
these
,
we
be
run
(
as
we
think
)
into
Halifax
Harbour
,
on
the
fifteenth
night
,
with
little
wind
and
a
bright
moon
---
indeed
,
we
have
make
the
light
at
its
outer
entrance
,
and
put
the
pilot
in
charge
---
when
suddenly
the
ship
strike
upon
a
bank
of
mud
.
 
<EOS>
an
immediate
rush
on
deck
take
place
of
course
;
the
side
be
crowd
in
an
instant
;
and
for
a
few
minute
we
be
in
as
lively
a
state
of
confusion
as
the
great
lover
of
disorder
would
desire
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
the
passenger
,
and
gun
,
and
water
-
cask
,
and
other
heavy
matter
,
be
all
huddle
together
<EOS>
aft
,
however
,
to
lighten
her
in
the
head
,
she
be
soon
get
off
;
and
after
some
driving
on
towards
an
uncomfortable
line
of
object
(
whose
vicinity
have
be
announce
very
early
in
the
disaster
by
a
loud
cry
of
"
Breakers
a
-
head
!
"
)
and
much
backing
of
paddle
,
and
heaving
of
the
lead
into
a
constantly
decrease
depth
of
water
,
we
drop
anchor
in
a
strange
outlandish
-
look
nook
which
nobody
on
board
could
recognise
,
although
there
be
land
all
about
us
,
and
so
close
that
we
could
plainly
see
the
wave
branch
of
the
tree
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
strange
enough
,
in
the
silence
of
midnight
,
and
the
dead
stillness
that
seem
to
be
create
by
the
sudden
and
unexpected
stoppage
of
the
engine
which
have
be
clank
and
blast
in
our
ear
incessantly
for
so
many
day
,
to
watch
the
look
of
blank
astonishment
express
in
every
face
:
 
begin
with
the
officer
,
trace
it
through
all
the
passenger
,
and
descend
to
the
very
stoker
and
furnaceman
,
who
emerge
from
below
,
one
by
one
,
and
cluster
together
in
a
smoky
group
about
the
hatchway
of
the
engine
-
room
,
compare
note
in
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
after
throw
up
a
few
rocket
and
fire
signal
gun
in
the
hope
of
be
hail
from
the
land
,
or
at
least
of
see
a
light
---
but
without
any
other
sight
or
sound
present
itself
---
it
be
determined
to
send
a
boat
on
shore
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
amusing
to
observe
how
very
kind
some
of
the
passenger
be
,
in
volunteer
to
go
ashore
in
this
same
boat
:
for
the
general
good
,
of
course
:
 
not
by
any
mean
because
they
think
the
ship
in
an
unsafe
position
,
or
contemplate
the
possibility
of
her
heeling
over
in
case
the
tide
be
run
out
.
<EOS>
nor
be
it
less
amusing
to
remark
how
desperately
unpopular
the
poor
pilot
become
in
one
short
minute
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
have
his
passage
out
from
Liverpool
,
and
during
the
whole
voyage
have
be
quite
a
notorious
character
,
as
a
teller
of
anecdote
and
cracker
of
joke
.
<EOS>
yet
here
be
the
very
man
who
have
laugh
the
loud
at
his
jest
,
now
flourish
their
fist
in
his
face
,
load
him
with
imprecation
,
and
defy
him
to
his
tooth
as
a
villain
!
   
<EOS>
the
boat
soon
shove
off
,
with
a
lantern
and
sundry
blue
light
on
board
;
and
in
less
than
an
hour
return
;
the
officer
in
command
bring
with
him
a
tolerably
tall
young
tree
,
which
he
have
pluck
up
by
the
root
,
to
satisfy
certain
distrustful
passenger
whose
mind
misgave
them
that
they
be
to
be
impose
upon
and
shipwreck
,
and
who
would
on
no
other
term
believe
that
he
have
be
ashore
,
or
have
do
anything
but
fraudulently
row
a
little
way
into
the
mist
,
specially
to
deceive
them
and
compass
their
death
.
<EOS>
Our
captain
have
foresee
from
the
first
that
we
must
be
in
a
place
call
the
eastern
passage
;
and
so
we
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
about
the
last
place
in
the
world
in
which
we
have
any
business
or
reason
to
be
,
but
a
sudden
fog
,
and
some
error
on
the
pilot
's
part
,
be
the
cause
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
surround
by
bank
,
and
rock
,
and
shoal
of
all
kind
,
but
have
happily
drift
,
it
seem
,
upon
the
only
safe
speck
that
be
to
be
find
thereabout
.
 
<EOS>
ease
by
this
report
,
and
by
the
assurance
that
the
tide
be
past
the
ebb
,
we
turn
in
at
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
dress
about
half
-
past
nine
next
day
,
when
the
noise
above
hurry
me
on
deck
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
leave
it
overnight
,
it
be
dark
,
foggy
,
and
damp
,
and
there
be
bleak
hill
<EOS>
all
round
us
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
we
be
glide
down
a
smooth
,
broad
stream
,
at
the
rate
of
eleven
mile
an
hour
:
 
our
colour
fly
gaily
;
our
crew
rig
out
in
their
smart
clothe
;
our
officer
in
uniform
again
;
the
sun
shine
as
on
a
brilliant
April
day
in
England
;
the
land
stretch
out
on
either
side
,
streak
with
light
patch
of
snow
;
white
wooden
house
;
people
at
their
door
;
telegraph
work
;
flag
hoist
;
wharf
appear
;
ship
;
<EOS>
quay
crowd
with
people
;
distant
noise
;
shout
;
man
and
boy
run
down
steep
place
towards
the
pier
:
 
all
more
bright
and
gay
and
fresh
to
our
unused
eye
than
word
can
paint
them
.
 
<EOS>
We
come
to
a
wharf
,
pave
with
uplifted
face
;
get
alongside
,
and
be
make
fast
,
after
some
shouting
and
straining
of
cable
;
dart
,
a
score
of
us
along
the
gangway
,
almost
as
soon
as
it
be
thrust
out
to
meet
us
,
and
before
it
have
reach
the
ship
---
and
leap
upon
the
firm
glad
earth
again
!
   
<EOS>
I
suppose
this
Halifax
would
have
appear
an
Elysium
,
though
it
have
be
a
curiosity
of
ugly
dulness
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
carry
away
with
me
a
most
pleasant
impression
of
the
town
and
its
inhabitant
,
and
have
preserve
it
to
this
hour
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
it
without
regret
that
I
come
home
,
without
have
find
an
opportunity
of
return
thither
,
and
once
more
shake
hand
with
the
friend
I
make
that
day
.
   
<EOS>
It
happen
to
be
the
opening
of
the
Legislative
Council
and
General
Assembly
,
at
which
ceremonial
the
form
observe
on
the
commencement
of
a
new
Session
of
Parliament
in
England
be
so
closely
copy
,
and
so

in

on

<EOS>
the
indescribable
interest
with
which
I
strain
my
eye
,
as
the
first
patch
of
american
soil
peep
like
molehill
from
the
green
sea

and
follow
them
,
as
they
swell

by
slow

almost
imperceptible

into

continuous

a

yet
the

dry

and
bright

that
the
temperature
be
not
only
endurable

delicious

<EOS>
how
I
remain
on
deck
,
stare
about
me
,
until
we
come
alongside
the
dock

and
how
,
though
I
have
have
as
many
eye
as
Argus

I
should
have
have
them
all
wide
open
,
and
all
employ
on
new
object
---
be
topic
which
I
will
not
prolong
this
chapter
to
discuss
.
 
<EOS>
neither
will
I
more
than
hint
at
my
foreigner
-
like
mistake
in
supposing
that
a
party
of
most
active
person
,
who
scramble
on
board
at
the
peril
of
their
life
as
we
approach
the
wharf
,
be
newsman
,
answer
to
that
industrious
class
at

whereas
,
despite
the
leathern
wallet
of
news
sling
about
the
neck
of
some
,
and
the
broad
sheet
in
the
hand
of
all

they
be

who
board

inform
me
)
,
"
because
they
like
the
excitement
of
it

"
 
<EOS>
suffice
it
in
this
place
to
say
,
that
one
of
these
invader
,
with
a
ready
courtesy
for
which
I
thank
him
here
most
gratefully
,
go
on
before
to
order
room
at
the
hotel
;
and
that
when
I
follow
,
as
I
soon
do
,
I
find
myself
roll
through
the
long
passage
with
an
involuntary
imitation
of
the
gait
of
Mr
T
P
Cooke
,
in
a
new
nautical
melodrama

<EOS>
"
dinner
,
if
you
please
,
"
say
I
to
the
waiter
.
   
<EOS>
"
when
?
"
say
the
waiter
.
   
<EOS>
"
as
quick
as
possible
,
"
say
I.
   
<EOS>
"
right
away
?
"
say
the
waiter
.
   
<EOS>
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
I
answer
"
no
,
"
at
hazard
.
   
<EOS>
"
not
right
away
?
"
cry
the
waiter
,
with
an
amount
of
surprise
that
make
me
start
.
   
<EOS>
I
look
at
him
doubtfully
,
and
return
,
"
<EOS>
no
;
I
would
rather
have
it
in
this
private
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
it
very
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
at
this
,
I
really
think
the
waiter
must
have
go
out
of
his
mind
:
 
as
I
believe
he
would
have
do
,
but
for
the
interposition
of
another
man
,
who
whisper
in
his
ear
,
"
directly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
and
that
be
a
fact
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
waiter
,
look
helplessly
at
me
:
 
"
right
away
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
see
now
that
"
right
away
"
and
"
directly
"
be
one
and
the
same
thing
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
reverse
my
previous
answer
,
and
sit
down
to
dinner
in
ten
minute
afterwards
;
and
a
capital
dinner
it
be
.
   
<EOS>
the
hotel
(
a
very
excellent
one
)
be
call
the
Tremont
House
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
more
gallery
,
colonnade
,
piazza
,
and
passage
than
I
can
remember
,
or
the
reader
would
believe

Chapter
03
.
<EOS>
Boston
 
<EOS>
in
all
the
public
establishment
of
America
,
the
utmost
courtesy
prevail
.
 
<EOS>
Most
of
our
department
be
susceptible
of
considerable
improvement
in
this
respect
,
but
the
Custom
-
house
above
all
other
would
do
well
to
take
example
from
the
United
States
and
render
itself
somewhat
less
odious
and
offensive
to
foreigner
.
 
<EOS>
the
servile
rapacity
of
the
french
official
be
sufficiently
contemptible
;
but
there
be
a
surly
boorish
incivility
about
our
man
,
alike
disgusting
to
all
person
who
fall
into
their
hand
,
and
discreditable
to
the
nation
that
keep
such
ill
-
condition
cur
snarl
about
its
gate
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
land
in
America
,
I
could
not
help
be
strongly
impressed
with
the
contrast
their
Custom
-
house
present
,
and
the
attention
,
politeness
and
good
humour
with
which
its
officer
discharge
their
duty
.
   
<EOS>
as
we
do
not
land
at
Boston
,
in
consequence
of
some
detention
at
the
wharf
,
until
after
dark
,
I
receive
my
first
impression
of
the
city
in
walk
down
to
the
Custom
-
house
on
the
morning
after
our
arrival
,
which
be
Sunday
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
to
say
,
by
the
way
,
how
many
offer
of
pew
and
seat
in
church
for
that
morning
be
make
to
us
,
by
formal
note
of
invitation
,
before
we
have
half
finish
our
first
dinner
in
America
,
but
if
I
may
be
allow
to
make
a
moderate
guess
,
without
go
into
nice
calculation
,
I
should
say
that
at
least
as
many
sitting
be
proffer
us
,
as
would
have
accommodate
a
score
or
two
of
grow
-
up
family
.
 
<EOS>
the
number
of
creed
and
form
of
religion
to
which
the
pleasure
of
our
company
be
request
,
be
in
very
fair
proportion
.
   
<EOS>
not
be
able
,
in
the
absence
of
any
change
of
clothe
,
to
go
to
church
that
day
,
we
be
compel
to
decline
these
kindness
,
one
and
all
;
and
I
be
reluctantly
oblige
to
forego
the
delight
of
hear
Dr.
Channing
,
who
happen
to
preach
that
morning
for
the
first
time
in
a
very
long
interval
.
 
<EOS>
I
mention
the
name
of
this
distinguish
and
accomplished
man
(
with
whom
I
soon
afterwards
have
the
pleasure
of
become
personally
acquaint
)
<EOS>
,
that
I
may
have
the
gratification
of
record
my
humble
tribute
of
admiration
and
respect
for
his
high
ability
and
character
;
and
for
the
bold
philanthropy
with
which
he
have
ever
oppose
himself
to
that
most
hideous
blot
and
foul
disgrace
---
slavery
.
   
<EOS>
to
return
to
Boston
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
get
into
the
street
upon
this
Sunday
morning
,
the
air
be
so
clear
,
the
house
be
so
bright
and
gay
:
the
signboard
be
paint
in
such
gaudy
colour
;
the
gild
letter
be
so
very
golden
;
the
brick
be
so
very
red
,
the
stone
be
so
very
white
,
the
blind
and
area
railing
be
so
very
green
,
the
knob
and
plate
upon
the
street
door
so
marvellously
bright
and
twinkle
;
and
all
so
slight
and
unsubstantial
in
appearance
---
that
every
thoroughfare
in
the
city
look
exactly
like
a
scene
in
a
pantomime
.
 
<EOS>
It
rarely
happen
in
the
business
street
that
a
tradesman
,
if
I
may
venture
to
call
anybody
a
tradesman
,
where
everybody
be
a
merchant
,
reside
above
his
store
;
so
that
many
occupation
be
often
carry
on
in
one
house
,
and
the
whole
front
be
cover
with
board
and
inscription
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
walk
along
,
I
keep
glance
up
at
these
board
,
confidently
expect
to
see
a
few
of
them
change
into
something
;
and
I
never
turn
a
corner
suddenly
without
look
out
for
the
clown
and
pantaloon
,
who
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
be
hide
in
a
doorway
or
behind
some
pillar
close
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
Harlequin
and
Columbine
,
I
discover
immediately
that
they
lodge
(
they
be
always
look
after
lodging
in
a
pantomime
)
at
a
very
small
clockmaker
's
one
story
high
,
near
the
hotel
;
which
,
in
addition
to
various
symbol
and
device
,
almost
cover
the
whole
front
,
have
a
great
dial
hang
out
---
to
be
jump
through
,
of
course
.
   
<EOS>
the
suburb
be
,
if
possible
,
even
more
unsubstantial
-
look
than
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
the
white
wooden
house
<EOS>
(
so
white
that
it
make
one
wink
to
look
at
them
)
,
with
their
green
jalousie
blind
,
be
so
sprinkled
and
drop
about
in
all
direction
,
without
seem
to
have
any
root
at
all
in
the
ground
;
and
the
small
church
and
chapel
be
so
prim
,
and
bright
,
and
highly
varnish
;
that
I
almost
believe
the
whole
affair
could
be
take
up
piecemeal
like
a
child
's
toy
,
and
cram
into
a
little
box
.
   
<EOS>
the
city
be
a
beautiful
one
,
and
can
not
fail
,
I
should
imagine
,
to
impress
all
stranger
very
favourably
.
 
<EOS>
the
private
dwelling
-
house
be
,
for
the
most
part
,
large
and
elegant
;
the
shop
extremely
good
;
and
the
public
building
handsome
.
 
<EOS>
the
State
House
be
build
upon
the
summit
of
a
hill
,
which
rise
gradually
at
first
,
and
afterwards
by
a
steep
ascent
,
almost
from
the
water
's
edge
.
 
<EOS>
in
front
be
a
green
enclosure
,
call
the
Common
.
 
<EOS>
the
site
be
beautiful
:
 
and
from
the
top
there
be
a
charming
panoramic
view
of
the
whole
town
and
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
in
addition
to
a
variety
of
commodious
office
,
it
contain
two
handsome
chamber
;
in
one
the
House
of
Representatives
of
the
State
hold
their
meeting
:
 
in
the
other
,
the
Senate
.
 
<EOS>
such
proceeding
as
I
see
here
,
be
conduct
with
perfect
gravity
and
decorum
;
and
be
certainly
calculate
to
inspire
attention
and
respect
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
that
much
of
the
intellectual
refinement
and
superiority
of
Boston
,
be
referable
to
the
quiet
influence
of
the
University
of
Cambridge
,
which
be
within
three
or
four
mile
of
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
the
resident
professor
at
that
university
be
gentleman
of
learn
and
varied
attainment
;
and
be
,
without
one
exception
that
I
can
call
to
mind
,
man
who
would
shed
a
grace
upon
,
and
do
honour
to
,
any
society
in
the
civilised
world
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
the
resident
gentry
in
Boston
and
its
neighbourhood
,
and
I
think
I
be
not
mistake
in
add
,
a
large
majority
of
those
who
be
attach
to
the
liberal
profession
there
,
have
be
educate
at
this
same
school
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
the
defect
of
american
university
may
be
,
they
disseminate
no
prejudice
;
rear
no
bigot
;
dig
up
the
bury
ashe
of
no
old
superstition
;
never
interpose
between
the
people
and
their
improvement
;
exclude
no
man
because
of
his
religious
opinion
;
above
all
,
in
their
whole
course
of
study
and
instruction
,
recognise
a
world
,
and
a
broad
one
too
,
lie
beyond
the
college
wall
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
source
of
inexpressible
pleasure
to
me
to
observe
the
almost
imperceptible
,
but
not
less
certain
effect
,
work
by
this
institution
among
the
small
community
of
Boston
;
and
to
note
at
every
turn
the
humanising
taste
and
desire
it
have
engender
;
<EOS>
the
affectionate
friendship
to
which
it
have
give
rise
;
the
amount
of
vanity
and
prejudice
it
have
dispel
.
 
<EOS>
the
golden
calf
they
worship
at
Boston
be
a
pigmy
compare
with
the
giant
effigy
set
up
in
other
part
of
that
vast
counting
-
house
which
lie
beyond
the
Atlantic
;
and
the
almighty
dollar
sink
into
something
comparatively
insignificant
,
amidst
a
whole
pantheon
of
well
god
.
   
<EOS>
above
all
,
I
sincerely
believe
that
the
public
institution
and
charity
of
this
capital
of
Massachusetts
be
as
nearly
perfect
,
as
the
most
considerate
wisdom
,
benevolence
,
and
humanity
,
can
make
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
in
my
life
be
more
affect
by
the
contemplation
of
happiness
,
under
circumstance
of
privation
and
bereavement
,
than
in
my
visit
to
these
establishment
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
great
and
pleasant
feature
of
all
such
institution
in
America
,
that
they
be
either
support
by
the
State
or
assist
by
the
state
;
or
(
in
the
event
of
their
not
need
its
help
hand
)
that
they
act
in
concert
with
it
,
and
be
emphatically
the

I
can
not
but
think
,
with
a
view
to
the
principle
and
its
tendency
to
elevate
or
depress
the
character
of
the
industrious
class
,
that
a
Public
Charity
be
immeasurably
well
than
a
Private
Foundation
,
no
matter
how
munificently
the
latter
may
be
endow
.
 
<EOS>
in
our
own
country
,
where
it
have
not
,
until
within
these
later
day
,
be
a
very
popular
fashion
with
government
to
display
any
extraordinary
regard
for
the
great
mass
of
the
people
or
to
recognise
their
existence
as
improvable
creature
,
private
charity
,
unexample
in
the
history
of
the
earth
,
have
arise
,
to
do
an
incalculable
amount
of
good
among
the
destitute
and
afflict
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
government
of
the
country
,
have
neither
act
nor
part
in
them
,
be
not
in
the
receipt
of
any
portion
of
the
gratitude
they
inspire
;
and
,
offer
very
little
shelter
or
relief
beyond
that
which
be
to
be
find
in
the
workhouse
and
the
jail
,
have
come
,
not
unnaturally
,
to
be
look
upon
by
the
poor
rather
as
a
stern
master
,
quick
to
correct
and
punish
,
than
a
kind
protector
,
merciful
and
vigilant
in
their
hour
of
need
.
   
<EOS>
the
maxim
that
out
of
evil
cometh
good
,
be
strongly
illustrate
by
these
establishment
at
home
;
as
the
record
of
the
Prerogative
Office
in
doctor
'
Commons
can
abundantly
prove
.
 
<EOS>
some
immensely
rich
old
gentleman

surround
by
needy
relative

make
,
upon
a
low
average
,
a

a

<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
or
lady
,
never
very
remarkable
in
the
good
of
time
for
good
temper
,
be
full
of
ache
and
pain
from
head
to
foot
;
full
of
fancy
and
caprice
;
full
of
spleen
,
distrust
,
suspicion
,
and
dislike
.
 
<EOS>
to
cancel
old
will
,
and
invent
new
one
,
be
at
last
the
sole
business
of
such
a
testator
's
existence
;
and
relation
and
friend
<EOS>
(
some
of

breed
up

from
their

specially
disqualify
from
devote
themselves
to
any
useful
pursuit

on
that
account
)
<EOS>
be
so
often
and
so
unexpectedly
and
summarily
cut
off
,
and
reinstate
,
and
cut
off
again
,
that
the
whole
family
,
down
to
the
remote
cousin
,
be
keep
in
a
perpetual
fever
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
it
become
plain
that
the
old
lady
or
gentleman
have
not
long
to
live
;
and
the
plainer
this
become
,
the
more
clearly
the
old
lady
or
gentleman
perceive
that
everybody
be
in
a
conspiracy
against
their
poor
old
dying
relative
;
wherefore
the
old
lady
or
gentleman
make
another
last
will
---
positively
the
last
this
time
---
conceal
the
same
in
a
china
teapot
,
and
expire
next
day
.
 
<EOS>
then
it
turn
out
,
that
the
whole
of
the
real
and
personal
estate
be
divide
between
half
-
a

dozen
charity
;
and
that
the
dead

go
testator
have
in
pure
spite
help
to
do
a
great
deal
of
good
,
at
the
cost
of
an
immense
amount
of
evil
passion
and
misery

<EOS>
the
Perkins

<EOS>
after

say
the

"
an

current

also
with
his

so
that
all
his

by

it

if

he

<EOS>
those
who
prove
unable

it

disqualify

<EOS>
I
go
to
see
this
place
<EOS>
one
very
fine
winter
morning
:
 
an
italian
sky
above
,
and
the
air
so
clear
and
bright
on
every
side
,
that
even
my
eye
,
which
be
none
of
the
good
,
could
follow
the
minute
line
and
scrap
of
tracery
in
distant
building
.
 
<EOS>
like
most
other
public
institution
in
America
,
of
the
same
class
,
it
stand
a
mile
or
two
without
the
town
,
in
a
cheerful
healthy
spot
;
and
be
an
airy
,
spacious
,
handsome
edifice
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
build
upon
a
height
,
command
the
harbour
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
pause
for
a
moment
at
the
door
,
and
mark
how
fresh
and
free
the
whole
scene
be
---
<EOS>
what
sparkling
bubble
glance
upon
the
wave
,
and
well
up
every
moment
to
the
surface
,
as
though
the
world
below
,
like
that
above
,
be
radiant
with
the
bright
day
,
and
gush
over
in
its
fulness
of
light
:
 
when
I
gaze
from
sail
to
sail
away
upon
a
ship
at
sea
,
a
tiny
speck
of
shine
white
,
the
only
cloud
upon
the
still
,
deep
,
distant
blue
---
and
,
turn
,
see
a
blind
boy
with
his
sightless
face
address
that
way
,
as
though
he
too
have
some
sense
within
him
of
the
glorious
distance
:
 
<EOS>
I
feel
a
kind
of
sorrow
that
the
place
should
be
so
very
light
,
and
a
strange
wish
that
for
his
sake
it
be
dark
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
but
momentary
,
of
course
,
and
a
mere
fancy
,
but
I
feel
it
keenly
for
all
that
.
   
<EOS>
the
child
be
at
their
daily
task
in
different
room
,
except
a
few
who
be
already
dismiss
,
and
be
at
play
.
 
<EOS>
here
,
as
in
many
institution
,
no
uniform
be
wear
;
and
I
be
very
glad
of
it
,
for
two
reason
.
 
<EOS>
firstly
,
because
I
be
sure
that
nothing
but
senseless
custom
and
want
of
thought
would
reconcile
us
to
the
livery
and
badge
we
be
so
fond
of
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
secondly
,
because
the
absence
of
these
thing
present
each
child
to
the
visitor
in
his
or
her
own
proper
character
,
with
its
individuality
unimpaired
;
not
lose
in
a
dull
,
ugly
,
monotonous
repetition
of
the
same
unmeaning
garb
:
which
be
really
an
important
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
the
wisdom
of
encourage
a
little
harmless
pride
in
personal
appearance
even
among
the
blind
,
or
the
whimsical
absurdity
of
consider
charity
and
leather
breech
inseparable
companion
,
as
we
do
,
require
no
comment
.
   
<EOS>
good
order
,
cleanliness
,
and
comfort
,
pervade
every
corner
of
the
building
.
 
<EOS>
the
various
class
,
who
be
gather
round
their
teacher
,
answer
the
question
put
to
them
with
readiness
and
intelligence
,
and
in
a
spirit
of
cheerful
contest
for
precedence
which
please
me
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
those
who
be
at
play
,
be
gleesome
and
noisy
as
other
child
.
 
<EOS>
more
spiritual
and
affectionate
friendship
appear
to
exist
among
them
,
than
would
be
find
among
other
young
person
suffer
under
no
deprivation
;
but
this
I
expect
and
be
prepared
to
find
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
part
of
the
great
scheme
of
Heaven
's
merciful
consideration
for
the
afflict
.
   
<EOS>
in
a
portion
of
the
building
,
set
apart
for
that
purpose
,
be
workshop
for
blind
person
whose
education
be
finish
,
and
who
have
acquire
a
trade
,
but
who
can
not
pursue
it
in
an
ordinary
manufactory
because
of
their
deprivation
.
 
<EOS>
several
people
be
at
work
here
;
make
brush
,
mattress
,
and
so
forth
;
and
the
cheerfulness
,
industry
,
and
good
order
discernible
in
every
other
part
of
the
building
,
extend
to
this
department
also
.
   
<EOS>
on
the
ringing
of
a
bell
,
the
pupil
all
repair
,
without
any
guide
or
leader
,
to
a
spacious
music
-
hall
,
where
they
take
their
seat
in
an
orchestra
erect
for
that
purpose
,
and
listen
with
manifest
delight
to
a
voluntary
on
the
organ
,
play
by
one
of
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
at
its
conclusion
,
the
performer
,
a
boy
of
nineteen
or
twenty
,
give
place
to
a
girl
;
and
to
her
accompaniment
they
all
sing
a
hymn
,
and
afterwards
a
sort
of
chorus
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
sad
to
look
upon
and
hear
them
,
happy
though
their
condition
unquestionably
be
;
and
I
see
that
one
blind
girl
,
who
(
be
for
the
time
deprive
of
the
use
of
her
limb
,
by
illness
)
sit
close
beside
me
with
her
face
towards
them
,
weep
silently
the
while
she
listen
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
strange
to
watch
the
face
of
the
blind
,
and
see
how
free
they
be
from
all
concealment
of
what
be
pass
in
their
thought
;
observe
which
,
a
man
with
eye
may
blush
to
contemplate
the
mask
he
wear
.
 
<EOS>
allow
for
one
shade
of
anxious
expression
which
be
never
absent
from
their
countenance
,
and
the
like
of
which
we
may
readily
detect
in
our
own
face
if
we
try
to
feel
our
way
in
the
dark
,
<EOS>
every
idea
,
as
it
rise
within
them
,
be
express
with
the
lightning
's
speed
and
nature
's
truth
.
 
<EOS>
if
the
company
at
a
rout
,
or
drawing
-
room
at
court
,
could
only
for
one
time
be
as
unconscious
of
the
eye
upon
them
as
blind
man
and
woman
be
,
what
secret
would
come
out
,
and
what
a
worker
of
hypocrisy
this
sight
,
the
loss
of
which
we
so
much
pity
,
would
appear
to
be
!
   
<EOS>
the
thought
occur
to
me
as
I
sit
down
in
another
room
,
before
a
girl
,
blind
,
deaf
,
and
dumb
;
destitute
of
smell
;
and
nearly
so
of
taste
:
 
before
a
fair
young
creature
with
every
human
faculty
,
and
hope
,
and
power
of
goodness
and
affection
,
inclose
within
her
delicate
frame
,
and
but
one
outward
sense
---
the
sense
of
touch
.
<EOS>
there
she
be
,
before
me
;
build
up
,
as
it
be
,
in
a
marble
cell
,
impervious
to
any
ray
of
light
,
or
particle
of
sound
;
with
her
poor
white
hand
peep
through
a
chink
in
the
wall
,
beckon
to
some
good
man
for
help
,
that
an
Immortal
soul
may
be
awaken
.
   
<EOS>
long
before
I
look
upon
her
,
the
help
have
come
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
be
radiant
with
intelligence
and
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
Her
hair
,
braid
by
her
own
hand
,
be
bind
about
a
head
,
whose
intellectual
capacity
and
development
be
beautifully
express
in
its
graceful
outline
,
and
its
broad
open
brow
;
<EOS>
her
dress
,
arrange
by
herself
,
be
a
pattern
of
neatness
and
simplicity
;
the
work
she
have
knit
,
lie
beside
her
;
her
writing
-
book
be
on
the
desk
she
lean
upon
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
from
the
mournful
ruin
of
such
bereavement
,
there
have
slowly
rise
up
this
gentle
,
tender
,
guileless
,
grateful
-
hearted
being
.
   
<EOS>
like
other
inmate
of
that
house
,
she
have
a
green
ribbon
bind
round
her
eyelid
.
 
<EOS>
a
doll
she
have
dress
lie
near
upon
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
it
up
,
and
see
that
she
have
make
a
green
fillet
such
as
she
wear
herself
,
and
fasten
it
about
its
mimic
eye
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
seat
in
a
little
enclosure
,
make
by
school
-
desk
and
form
,
write
her
daily
journal
.
 
<EOS>
but
soon
finish
this
pursuit
,
she
engage
in
an
animate
conversation
with
a
teacher
who
sit
beside
her
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
favourite
mistress
with
the
poor
pupil
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
could
see
the
face
of
her
fair
instructress
,
she
would
not
love
her
less
,
I
be
sure
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
extract
a
few
disjoint
fragment
of
her
history
,
from
an
account
,
write
by
that
one
man
who
have
make
her
what
she
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
beautiful
and
touching
narrative
;
and
I
wish
I
could
present
it
entire
.
   
<EOS>
Her
name
be
Laura
Bridgman
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
be
bear
in
Hanover
,
New
Hampshire
,
on
the
twenty
-
first
of
December
,
1829
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
describe
as
have
be
a
very
sprightly
and
pretty
infant
,
with
bright
blue
eye
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
,
however
,
so
puny
and
feeble
until
she
be
a
year
and
a
half
old
,
that
her
parent
hardly
hope
to
rear
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
subject
to
severe
fit
,
which
seem
to
rack
her
frame
almost
beyond
her
power
of
endurance
:
 
and
<EOS>
life
be
hold
by
the
feeble
tenure
:
 
but
<EOS>
when
a
year
and
a
half
old
,
she
seem
to
rally
;
the
dangerous
symptom
subside
;
and
at
twenty
month
old
,
she
be
perfectly
well
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
then
her
mental
power
,
hitherto
stint
in
their
growth
,
rapidly
develop
themselves
;
and
during
the
four
month
of
health
which
she
enjoy
,
she
appear
(
make
due
allowance
for
a
fond
mother
's
account
)
to
have
display
a
considerable
degree
of
intelligence

<EOS>
"
but
suddenly
she
sicken
again
;
her
disease
rage
with
great
violence
during
five
week
,
when
her
eye
and
ear
be
inflame
,
suppurated
,
and
their
content
be
discharge

<EOS>
but
though
sight
and
hearing
be
go
for
ever

the
poor
child

suffering
be
not
end

the
fever
rage
during
seven
week

for
five
month
she

It
be
now
observe
that

,
consequently
,
that
her
taste

blunt

what
a
situation
be
her
!

the
darkness

the
silence

around
her

no

smile
call
forth
her
answering
smile

no

voice
teach
her
to
imitate
his
sound

they

brother

be

form

resist
her
touch

which
differ
not

the
furniture
of
the
house

save
in
warmth

in
the
power

locomotion

in

from

dog

the
immortal
spirit
which
have
be
implant
within
her
could
not
die
,
nor
be
maim
nor
mutilate
;
and
though
most
of
its
avenue
of
communication
with
the
world
be
cut
off
,
it
begin
to
manifest
itself
through
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
she
could
walk
,
she
begin
to
explore
the
room
,
and
then
the
house
;
she
become
familiar
with
the
form
,
density
,
weight
,
and
heat
,
of
every
article
she
could
lay
her
hand
upon

She
follow
her
mother
,
and
feel
her
hand
and
arm
,
as
she
be
occupy
about
the
house
;
and
her
disposition
to
imitate
,
lead
her
to
repeat
everything
herself

She
even
learn
to
sew
a
little
,
and
to
knit

"
   
<EOS>
the
reader
will
scarcely
need
to
be
tell
,
however
,
that
the
opportunity
of
communicate
with
her
,
be
very
,
very
limited
;
and
that
the
moral
effect
of
her
wretched
state
soon
begin
to
appear
.
 
<EOS>
those
who
can
not
be
enlighten
by
reason
,
can
only
be
control
by
force
;
and
this
,
couple
with
her
great
privation
,
must
soon
have
reduce
her
to
a
bad
condition
than
that
of
the
beast
that
perish
,
but
for
timely
and
unhoped
-
for
aid

<EOS>
"
at
this
time
,
I
be
so
fortunate
as
to
hear
of
the
child
,
and
immediately
hasten
to
Hanover
to
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
her
with
a
well
-
form
figure
;
a
strongly
-
marked
,
nervous
-
sanguine
temperament
;
a
large
and
beautifully
-
shape
head
;
and
the
whole
system
in
healthy
action

<EOS>
the
parent
be
easily
induce
to
consent
to
her
come
to
Boston
,
and
on
the
4th
of
October
,
1837
,
they
bring
her
to
the
Institution
.
   
<EOS>
"
for
a
while
,
she
be
much
bewilder
;
and
after
wait
about
two
week
,
until
she
become
acquainted
with
her
new
locality
,
and
somewhat
familiar
with
the
inmate
,
the
attempt
be
make
to
give
her
knowledge
of
arbitrary
sign
,
by
which
she
could
interchange
thought
with
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
there
be
one
of
two
way
to
be
adopt
:
 
either
to
go
on
to
build
up
a
language
of
sign
on
the
basis
of
the
natural
language
which
she
have
already
commence
herself
,
or
to
teach
her
the
purely
arbitrary
language
in
common
use
:
 
that
is
,
to
give
her
a
sign
for
every
individual
thing
,
or
to
give
her
a
knowledge
of
letter
by
combination
of
which
she
may
express
her
idea
of
the
existence
,
and
the
mode
and
condition
of
existence
,
of
any
thing
.
 
<EOS>
the
former
would
have
be
easy
,
but
very
ineffectual
;
the
latter
seem
very
difficult
,
but
,
if
accomplished
,
very
effectual
.
 
<EOS>
I
determine
therefore
to
try
the
latter
.
   
<EOS>
"
the
first
experiment
be
make
by
take
article
in
common
use
,
such
as
knife
,
fork
,
spoon
,
keys
,
&
c.
,
and
paste
upon
them
label
with
their
name
print
in
raise
letter
.
 
<EOS>
these
<EOS>
she
feel
very
carefully
,
and
soon
,
of
course
,
distinguish
that
the
crooked
line
spoon
,
differ
as
much
from
the
crooked
line
KEY
,
as
the
spoon
differ
from
the
key
in
form
.
   
<EOS>
"
then
small
detach
label
,
with
the
same
word
print
upon
them
,
be
put
into
her
hand
;
and
she
soon
observe
that
they
be
similar
to
the
one
paste
on
the
article
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
show
her
perception
of
this
similarity
by
lay
the
label
key
upon
the
key
,
and
the
label
spoon
upon
the
spoon
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
encourage
here
by
the
natural
sign
of
approbation
,
pat
on
the
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
the
same
process
be
then
repeat
with
all
the
article
which
she
could
handle
;
and
she
very
easily
learn
to
place
the
proper
label
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
evident
,
however
,
that
the
only
intellectual
exercise
be
that
of
imitation
and
memory
.
 
<EOS>
She
recollect
that
the
label
BOOK
be
place
upon
a
book
,
and
she
repeat
the
process
first
from
imitation
,
next
from
memory
,
with
only
the
motive
of
love
of
approbation
,
but
apparently
without
the
intellectual
perception
of
any
relation
between
the
thing
.
   
<EOS>
"
after
a
while
,
instead
of
label
,
the
individual
letter
be
give
to
her
on
detached
bit
of
paper
:
 
they
be
arrange
side
by
side
so
as
to
spell
BOOK
,
KEY
,
&
c.
;
then
they
be
mix
up
in
a
heap
and
a
sign
be
make
for
her
to
arrange
them
herself
so
as
to
express
the
word
BOOK
,
KEY
,
&
c.
;
and
she
do
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hitherto
,
the
process
have
be
mechanical
,
and
the
success
about
as
great
as
teach
a
very
know
dog
a
variety
of
trick
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
child
have
sit
in
mute
amazement
,
and
patiently
imitate
everything
her
teacher
do
;
but
now
the
truth
begin
to
flash
upon
her
:
 
<EOS>
her
intellect
begin
to
work
:
 
<EOS>
she
perceive
that
here
be
a
way
by
which
she
could
herself
make
up
a
sign
of
anything
that
be
in
her
own
mind
,
and
show
it
to
another
mind
;
and
at
once
her
countenance
light
up
with
a
human
expression
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
no
longer
a
dog
,
or
parrot
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
an
immortal
spirit
,
eagerly
seize
upon
a
new
link
of
union
with
other
spirit
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
almost
fix
upon
the
moment
when
this
truth
dawn
upon
her
mind
,
and
spread
its
light
to
her
countenance
;
I
see
that
the
great
obstacle
be
overcome
;
and
that
henceforward
nothing
but
patient
and
persevere
,
but
plain
and
straightforward
,
effort
be
to
be
use
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
result
thus
far
,
be
quickly
relate
,
and
easily
conceive
;
but
not
so
be
the
process
;
for
many
week
of
apparently
unprofitable
labour
be
pass
before
it
be
effect
.
   
<EOS>
"
when
it
be
say
above
that
a
sign
be
make
,
it
be
intend
to
say
,
that
the
action
be
perform
by
her
teacher
,
she
feel
his
hand
,
and
then
imitate
the
motion
.
   
<EOS>
"
the
next
step
be
to
procure
a
set
of
metal
type
,
with
the
different
letter
of
the
alphabet
cast
upon
their
end
;
also
a
board
,
in
which
be
square
hole
,
into
which
hole
<EOS>
she
could
set
the
type
;
so
that
the
letter
on
their
end
could
alone
be
feel
above
the
surface
.
   
<EOS>
"
then
,
on
any
article
be
hand
to
her
,
for
instance
,
a
pencil
,
or
a
watch
,
she
would
select
the
component
letter
,
and
arrange
them
on
her
board
,
and
read
them
with
apparent
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
be
exercise
for
several
week
in
this
way
,
until
her
vocabulary
become
extensive
;
and
then
the
important
step
be
take
of
teach
her
how
to
represent
the
different
letter
by
the
position
of
her
finger
,
instead
of
the
cumbrous
apparatus
of
the
board
and
type
.
 
<EOS>
She
accomplish
this
speedily
and
easily
,
for
her
intellect
have
begin
to
work
in
aid
of
her
teacher
,
and
her
progress
be
rapid
.
   
<EOS>

this
be
the
period

about
three
month

she
have
commence

wonder
to
see
how
rapidly

correctly

eagerly

she
go
on
with
her
labour

Her
teacher
give
her
a
new
object
,
for
instance
,
a
pencil

first
let
her
examine
it
,
and
get
an
idea
of
its
use

then
teach
her
how
to
spell
it
by
make
the
sign
for
the
letter
with
her
own
finger
:
the
child
grasp
her
hand
,

feel
her
finger
,
as
the
different
letter
be
form
;
she
turn
her
head
a
little
on
one
side
like
a
person
listen
closely
;
her
lip
be
apart
;
she
seem
scarcely
to
breathe
;

her
countenance

at
first
anxious
,
gradually
change
to
a
smile

she
comprehend
the
lesson
.
 
<EOS>
She
then
hold
up
her
tiny
finger

spell
the
word
in
the
manual
alphabet

next
,
she
take
her
type

arrange
her
letter

make
sure
that
she
be
right

she
take
the
whole
of

the
word

the
object

the
whole
of

succeed
year

gratify
her
eager
inquiry

It
have
be
ascertain
beyond

that

not

never

have
no

she
seem
as
happy

playful
as

lamb

and
the
employment

her
intellectual
faculty

very
happy

knitting

will
busy
herself
for
hour

she
have
no

evidently
amuse
herself
by
imaginary
dialogue

fondly

such

fragment

most
interesting

instructive
history
of
Laura

<EOS>
the
name
of
her
great
benefactor

who

after

can
ever
hear
that

indifference

a
further
account
have
be
publish
by
Dr.

since
the
report
from
which
I
have
just
quote
.

It
describe
her
rapid
mental
growth
and
improvement
during
twelve
month
more
,
and
bring
her
little
history
down
to
the
end
of
last
year
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
remarkable
,
that
as
we
dream
in
word
,
and
carry
on
imaginary
conversation
,
in
which
we
speak
both
for
ourselves
and
for
the
shadow
who
appear
to
us
in
those
vision
of
the
night
,
so
she
,
have
no
word
,
use
her
finger
alphabet
in
her
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
and
it
have
be
ascertain
that
when
her
slumber
be
break
,
and
be
much
disturb
by
dream
,
she
express
her
thought
in
an
irregular
and
confused
manner
on
her
finger
:
 
just
as
we
should
murmur
and
mutter
them
indistinctly
,
in
the
like
circumstance
.
   
<EOS>
I
turn
over
the
leave
of
her
Diary
,
and
find
it
write
in
a
fair
legible
square
hand
,
and
express
in
term
which
be
quite
intelligible
without
any
explanation
.
 
<EOS>
on
my
saying
that
I
should
like
to
see
her
write
again
,
the
teacher
who
sit
beside
her
,
bid
her
,
in
their
language
,
sign
her
name
upon
a
slip
of
paper
,
twice
or
thrice
.
 
<EOS>
in
do
so
,
I
observe
that
she
keep
her
left
hand
always
touch
,
and
follow
up
,
her
right
,
in
which
,
of
course
,
she
hold
the
pen

<EOS>
no
line
be
indicate
by
any
contrivance

straight

freely

have
,
until
now
,
be
quite
unconscious
of
the
presence
of
visitor

,
have
her
hand
place
in
that
of
the
gentleman
who
accompany
me

she
immediately
express
his
name
upon
her
teacher
's
palm

<EOS>
indeed
her
sense
of
touch
be
now
so
exquisite

that
have
be
acquaint
with
a
person
once
,
she
can
recognise
him
or
her
after
almost
any
interval

<EOS>
this
gentleman
have
be
in
her
company

I
believe
,
but
very
seldom

certainly
have
not
see
her
for
many
month

she
reject
at
once

do

retain
my

with
evident
pleasure

her

exame
her
dress

a
girl
's
curiosity

interest

<EOS>
She
be
merry
and
cheerful
,
and
show
much
innocent
playfulness
in
her
intercourse
with
her
teacher

<EOS>
Her
delight
on
recognise
a
favourite
playfellow
and
companion
---
herself
a
blind
girl

who
silently
,
and
with
an
equal
enjoyment
of
the
come
surprise
,
take
a
seat
beside

beautiful
to

It
elicit
from
her
at
first
,
as
other
slight
circumstance
do
twice
or
thrice
during
my
visit

an
uncouth
noise

be
rather
painful
to
hear

touch
her
lip

she
immediately
desist

embrace
her
laughingly

affectionately

have
previously
be
into

evince

I
think
,
even
in
this

an
anxiety
peculiar
to
their
condition
,
that
their
little
feat
of
agility
should
be
see

among
them
be
a

entertain
himself

gymnastic
exercise

bring
the
arm
and
chest
into
play

he
enjoy
mightily

especially
when
,
in
thrust
out
his
right
arm

he
bring
it
into
contact
with
another
boy

young
child

deaf

dumb

and
blind

<EOS>
Dr.
Howe
's
account
of
this
pupil
's
first
instruction
be
so
very
striking
,
and
so
intimately
connect
with
Laura
herself
,
that
I
can
not
refrain
from
a
short
extract
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
premise
that
the
poor
boy
's
name
be
Oliver
Caswell
;
that
he
be
thirteen
year
of
age
;
and
that
he
be
in
full
possession
of
all
his
faculty
,
until
three
year
and
four
month
old
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
then
attack
by
scarlet
fever
;
in
four
week
become
deaf
;
in
a
few
week
more
,
blind
;
in
six
month
,
dumb
.
 
<EOS>
He
show
his
anxious
sense
of
this
last
deprivation
,
by
often
feel
the
lip
of
other
person
when
they
be
talk
,
and
then
put
his
hand
upon
his
own
,
as
if
to
assure
himself
that
he
have
them
in
the
right
position
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
thirst
for
knowledge
,
"
say
Dr.
Howe
,
"
proclaim
itself
as
soon
as
he
enter
the
house
,
by
his
eager
examination
of
everything
he
could
feel
or
smell
in
his
new
location
.
 
<EOS>
for
instance
,
tread
upon
the
register
of
a
furnace
,
he
instantly
stoop
down
,
and
begin
to
feel
it
,
and
soon
discover
the
way
in
which
the
upper
plate
move
upon
the
low
one
;
but
this
be
not
enough
for
him
,
so
lie
down
upon
his
face
,
he
apply
his
tongue
first
to
one
,
then
to
the
other
,
and
seem
to
discover
that
they
be
of
different
kind
of
metal
.
   
<EOS>
"
His
sign
be
expressive
:
 
and
the
strictly
natural
language
,
laughing
,
cry
,
sighing
,
kissing
,
embracing
,
&
c.
,
be
perfect
.
   
<EOS>
"
some
of
the
analogical
sign
which
(
guide
by
his
faculty
of
imitation
)
he
have
contrive
,
be
comprehensible
;
such
as
the
wave
motion
of
his
hand
for
the
motion
of
a
boat
,
the
circular
one
for
a
wheel
,
&
c.
   
<EOS>
"
the
first
object
be
to
break
up
the
use
of
these
sign
and
to
substitute
for
them
the
use
of
purely
arbitrary
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
profit
by
the
experience
I
have
gain
in
the
other
case

I
omit
several
step
of
the
process
before
employ
,

commence
at
once
with
the
finger
language

several
article
have
short
name

such

key

cup

mug

with
Laura
for
an
auxiliary

sit
down

take
his

place
it
upon

of
them

with
my
own

make
the
letter
KEY

He
feel
my
hand
eagerly
with
both
of
his
,

on
my
repeat
the
process

he
evidently
try
to
imitate

motion
of
my
finger

few
minute

interested

the
two
present
a
singular
sight

her
face
be
flush

anxious

her
finger
twine
in
among
our
so
closely
as
to
follow
every
motion
,

so
slightly
as
not
to
embarrass
them

stand
attentive

head
a
little
aside
,
his
face
turn
up
,
his
left
hand
grasp
mine
,
and
his
right
hold
out
:
 
at
every
motion
of
my
finger
his
countenance
betoken
keen
attention
;
there
be
an
expression
of
anxiety
as
he
try
to
imitate
the
motion
;
then
a
smile
come
steal
out
as
he
think
he
could
do
so
,
and
spread
into
a
joyous
laugh
the
moment
he
succeed
,
and
feel
me
pat
his
head
,
and
Laura
clap
him
heartily
upon
the
back
,
and
jump
up
and
down
in
her
joy
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
learn
more
than
a
half
-
dozen
letter
in
half
an
hour
,
and
seem
delighted
with
his
success
,
at
least
in
gain
approbation
.
<EOS>
His
attention
then
begin
to
flag
,
and
I
commence
play
with
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
that
in
all
this
he
have
merely
be
imitate
the
motion
of
my
finger
,
and
place
his
hand
upon
the
key
,
cup
,
&
c.
,
as
part
of
the
process
,
without
any
perception
of
the
relation
between
the
sign
and
the
object
.
   
<EOS>
"
when
he
be
tired
with
play
<EOS>
I
take
him
back
to
the
table
,
and
he
be
quite
ready
to
begin
again
his
process
of
imitation
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
learn
to
make
the
letter
for
KEY
,
PEN
,
PIN
;
and
by
have
the
object
repeatedly
place
in
his
hand
,
he
at
last
perceive
the
relation
I
wish
to
establish
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
evident
,
because
,
when
I
make
the
letter
pin
,
or
PEN
,
or
CUP
,
he
would
select
the
article
.
   
<EOS>
"
the
perception
of
this
relation
be
not
accompany
by
that
radiant
flash
of
intelligence
,
and
that
glow
of
joy
,
which
mark
the
delightful
moment
when
Laura
first
perceive
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
place
all
the
article
on
the
table
,
and
go
away
a
little
distance
with
the
child
,
place
Oliver
's
finger
in
the
position
to
spell
KEY
,
on
which
Laura
go
and
bring
the
article
:
 
<EOS>
the
little
fellow
seem
much
amuse
by
this
,
and
look
very
attentive
and
smile
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
cause
him
to
make
the
letter
BREAD
,
and
in
an
instant
Laura
go
and
bring
him
a
piece
:
 
<EOS>
he
smell
at
it
;
put
it
to
his
lip
;
cock
up
his
head
with
a
most
knowing
look
;
seem
to
reflect
a
moment
;
and
then
laugh
outright
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
aha
!
 
<EOS>
I
understand
now
how
something
may
be
make
out
of
this
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
now
clear
that
he
have
the
capacity
and
inclination
to
learn
,
that
he
be
a
proper
subject
for
instruction
,
and
need
only
persevere
attention
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
put
him
in
the
hand
of
an
intelligent
teacher
,
nothing
doubt
of
his
rapid
progress
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
well
may
this
gentleman
call
that
a
delightful
moment
,
in
which
some
distant
promise
of
her
present
state
first
gleam
upon
the
darken
mind
of
Laura
Bridgman
.
 
<EOS>
throughout
his
life
,
the
recollection
of
that
moment
will
be
to
him
a
source
of
pure
,
unfade
happiness
;
nor
will
it
shine
less
brightly
on
the
evening
of
his
day
of
Noble
Usefulness

<EOS>
the
affection
which
exist
between
these
two
---
the
master
and
the
pupil

be
as
far
remove
from
all
ordinary
care

as
the
circumstance
in
which
it
have
have
its
growth
,
be
apart

<EOS>
He
be
occupy
now
,
in
devising
mean
of
impart
to
her

high
knowledge

and
of
convey
to
her
some
adequate
idea
of
the
Great
Creator

,
dark

silent

scentless
though
it

Ye

<EOS>
let
that
poor

of
her
lie
gently
on
your

for
there
may
be
something
in
its
healing
touch
akin
to
that
of
the
Great
Master

precept
you
misconstrue

whose

you

of

<EOS>
as
I
rise
to
quit
the
room

a
pretty
little
child
of
one

kindness

which
twenty

would
have

Asylum

the
resident
physician

as
we
walk
along
the

his

flock
round
us
unrestrained
.
 
<EOS>
of
those
who
deny
or

the
wisdom
of
this
maxim
after
witness
its
effect
,
if
there
be
such
people
still
alive

I
can
only
say
that
I
hope
I
may
never
be
summon
as
a
Juryman
on
a
Commission
of
Lunacy
<EOS>
whereof
they
be
the
subject
;
for
I
should
certainly
find
them
out
of
their
sense
,
on
such
evidence
alone
.
   
<EOS>
each
ward
in
this
institution
be
shape
like
a
long
gallery
or
hall
,
with
the
dormitory
of
the
patient
open
from
it
on
either
hand
.
 
<EOS>
here
they
work
,
read
,
play
at
skittle

and
other
game
;
and
when
the
weather
do
not
admit
of
their

exercise
out

pass
the
day
together

<EOS>
in
one
of

calmly

the

with
a
couple

<EOS>
these
lady
be
graceful

handsome

and
it
be
not
difficult
to
perceive
at
a
glance
that
even
their
presence
there
,
have
a
highly
beneficial
influence
on
the
patient
who
be
group
about
them

<EOS>
lean
her
head
against
the
chimney

piece
,
with
a
great
assumption
of
dignity
and
refinement
of
manner

sit
an
elderly

many
scrap

<EOS>
Her
head
in
particular
be
so
strew
with
scrap
of
gauze

cotton
and
bit
of
paper

and
have
so
many
queer
odd

end
stick
all
about
it

that
it
look
like
a
bird's

nest

<EOS>
She
be
radiant
with
imaginary
jewel
;
wear
a
rich
pair
of
undoubted
gold
spectacle
;
and
gracefully
drop
upon
her
lap
,
as
we
approach
,
a
very
old
greasy
newspaper
,
in
which
I
dare
say
she
have
be
read
an
account
of
her
own
presentation
at
some
Foreign
Court
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
be
thus
particular
in
describe
her
,
because
she
will
serve
to
exemplify
the
physician
's
manner
of
acquire
and
retain
the
confidence
of
his
patient

<EOS>
"

aloud

take
me
by

advance
to
the
fantastic

great
politeness

not
raise
her
suspicion
by
the
slight
look

or
any

aside

It

She

you

<EOS>
She
be
kind
enough
to
receive
my
visit
,
and
to
permit
my
wife
and
family
to
reside
here
;
for
which
it
be
hardly
necessary
to
say
,
we
be
much
indebted

courteous

on

she
bow
condescendingly

the
pleasure

very
tempestuous
passage

Mr
Dickens

the
lady

the
house

<EOS>
We
exchange
the
most
dignified
salutation
with
profound
gravity
and
respect
,
and
so
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
the
rest
of
the
madwoman
seem
to
understand
the
joke
perfectly
(
not
only
in
this
case
,
but
in
all
the
other
,
except
their
own
)
,
and
be
highly
amuse
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
nature
of
their
several
kind
of
insanity
be
make
known
to
me
in
the
same
way
,
and
we
leave
each
of
them
in
high
good
humour

<EOS>
not
only
be
a
thorough
confidence
establish
,
by
those
mean
,
between
the
physician
and
patient
,
in
respect
of
the
nature
and
extent
of
their
hallucination
,
but
it
be
easy
to
understand
that
opportunity
be
afford
for
seize
any
moment
of
reason
,
to
startle
them
by
place
their
own
delusion
before
them
in
its
most
incongruous
and
ridiculous
light
.
   
<EOS>
every
patient
in
this
asylum
sit
down
to
dinner
every
day
with
a
knife
and
fork
;
and
in
the
midst
of
them
sit
the
gentleman
,
whose
manner
of
deal
with
his
charge
,
I
have
just
describe

<EOS>
at
every
meal
,
moral
influence
alone
restrain
the
more
violent
among
them
from
cut
the
throat
of
the
rest
;
but
the
effect
of
that
influence
be
reduce
to
an
absolute
certainty
,
and
be
find
,
even
as
a
means
of
restraint
,
to
say
nothing
of
it
as
a
means
of
cure
,
a
hundred
time
more
efficacious
than
all
the
strait

waistcoat
,
fetter
,
and
handcuff
,
that
ignorance
,
prejudice
,
and
cruelty
have
manufacture
since

<EOS>
in
the
labour
department

every
patient

his
trade
as
if
he
be
a
sane
man

<EOS>
in
the
garden

and
on
the
farm

they
work
with
spade

<EOS>
for
amusement

and
ride
out

take
the
air
in
carriage
provide
for
the
purpose

<EOS>
They
have
among
themselves
a
sewing
society
to
make
clothe
for
the
poor

which
hold
meeting
,
pass
resolution
,
never
come
to
fisty
-
cuff
or
bowie
-
knife
as
sane
assembly
have
be
know
to
do
elsewhere
;
and
conduct
all
its
proceeding
with
the
great
decorum

<EOS>
the
irritability

which
would
otherwise
be
expend
on
their

these

<EOS>
They
be
cheerful
,
tranquil
,
and
healthy

<EOS>
once
a
week
they
have
a
ball
,
in
which
the
Doctor
and
his
family
,
with
all
the
nurse
and
attendant
,
take
an
active
part
.
 
<EOS>
dance
and
marche
be
perform
alternately
,
to
the
enliven
strain
of
a
piano
;
and
now
and
then
some
gentleman
or
lady
(
whose
proficiency
have
be
previously
ascertain
)
oblige
the
company
with
a
song
:
nor
do
it
ever
degenerate
,
at
a
tender
crisis
,
into
a
screech
or
howl
;
wherein
,
I
must
confess
,
I
should
have
think
the
danger
lie
.
 
<EOS>
at
an
early
hour
they
all
meet
together
for
these
festive
purpose
;
at
eight
o'clock
refreshment
be
serve
;
and
at
nine
they
separate
.
   
<EOS>
immense
politeness
and
good
breeding
be
observe
throughout
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
take
their
tone
from
the
Doctor
;
and
he
move
a
very
Chesterfield
among
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
like
other
assembly
,
these
entertainment
afford
a
fruitful
topic
of
conversation
among
the
lady
for
some
day
;
and
the
gentleman
be
so
anxious
to
shine
on
these
occasion
,
that
they
have
be
sometimes
find
"
practise
their
step
"
in
private
,
to
cut
a
more
distinguished
figure
in
the
dance
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
obvious
that
one
great
feature
of
this
system
,
be
the
inculcation
and
encouragement
,
even
among
such
unhappy
person
,
of
a
decent
self
-
respect
.
 
<EOS>
something
of
the
same
spirit
pervade
all
the
institution
at
South
Boston
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
the
House
of
Industry

<EOS>
in
that
branch
of

which
be
devoted

"

<EOS>
It
be
not

that

<EOS>
they
must
be
evil

disposed
and
wicked
people
,
before
whose
vicious
eye
it
be
necessary
to
flourish
threat
and
harsh
restraint
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
meet
at
the
very
threshold
with
this
mild
appeal
.
 
<EOS>
all
within
-
door
be
very
plain
and
simple
,
as
it
ought
to
be
,
but
arrange
with
a
view
to
peace
and
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
It
cost
no
more
than
any
other
plan
of
arrangement

but
it
speak
an
amount
of
consideration
for
those
who
be
reduce
to
seek
a
shelter
there
,
which
put
them
at
once
upon
their
gratitude
and
good
behaviour

<EOS>
instead
of

parcel
out
in
great

long

where
a

<EOS>
in
these

the
well

They
have
a
motive
for
exertion
and
become
pride
,
in
the
desire
to
make
these
little
chamber
comfortable
and
decent
.
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
remember
one
<EOS>
but
it
be
clean
and
neat
,
and
have
its
plant
or
two
upon
the
window
-
sill
,
or
row
of
crockery
upon
the
shelf
,
or
small
display
of
coloured
print
upon
the
whitewashed
wall
,
or
,
perhaps
,
its
wooden
clock
behind
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
the
orphan
and
young
child
be
in
an
adjoining
building
separate
from
this
,
but
a
part
of
the
same
Institution
.
 
<EOS>
some
be
such
little
creature
,
that
the
stair
be
of
lilliputian
measurement
,
fit
to
their
tiny
stride
.
 
<EOS>
the
same
consideration
for
their
year
and
weakness
be
express
in
their
very
seat
,
which
be
perfect
curiosity
,
and
look
like
article
of
furniture
for
a
pauper
doll's
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
imagine
the
glee
of
our
Poor
Law
Commissioners
at
the
notion
of
these
seat
have
arm
and
back
;
but
small
spine
be
of
old
date
than
their
occupation
of
the
Board
-
room
at
Somerset
House
<EOS>
,
I
think
even
this
provision
very
merciful
and
kind
.
   
<EOS>
here
again
,
I
be
greatly
pleased
with
the
inscription
on
the
wall
,
which
be
scrap
of
plain
morality
,
easily
remember
and
understand
:
 
such
as
"
love
one
another
"
---
"
God
remember
the
small
creature
in
his
creation
:
"
and
straightforward
advice
of
that
nature
.
 
<EOS>
the
book
and
task
of
these
small
of
scholar
,
be
adapt
,
in
the
same
judicious
manner
,
to
their
childish
power
.
 
<EOS>
when
we
have
examine
these
lesson
,
four
morsel
of
girl
(
of
whom
one
be
blind
)
sing
a
little
song
,
about
the
merry
month
of
May
,
which
I
think
(
be
extremely
dismal
)
would
have
suit
an
English
November
better
.
 
<EOS>
that
do
,
we
go
to
see
their
sleeping
-
room
on
the
floor
above
,
in
which
the
arrangement
be
no
less
excellent
and
gentle
than
those
we
have
see
below
.
 
<EOS>
and
after
observe
that
the
teacher
be
of
a
class
and
character
well
suited
to
the
spirit
of
the
place
,
I
take
leave
of
the
infant
with
a
light
heart
than
ever
I
have
take
leave
of
pauper
infant
yet
.
   
<EOS>
connect
with
the
House
of
Industry
,
there
be
also
an
Hospital
,
which
be
in
the
good
order
,
and
have
,
I
be
glad
to
say
,
many
bed
unoccupied
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
one
fault
,
however
,
which
be
common
to
all
american
interior
:
 
the
presence
of
the
eternal
,
accurse
,
suffocate
,
red
-
hot
demon
of
a
stove
,
whose
breath
would
blight
the
pure
air
under
Heaven
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
two
establishment
for
boy
in
this
same
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
one
be
call
the
Boylston
school
,
and
be
an
asylum
for
neglected
and
indigent
boy
who
have
commit
no
crime
,
but
who
in
the
ordinary
course
of
thing
would
very
soon
be
purge
of
that
distinction
if
they
be
not
take
from
the
hungry
street
and
send
here
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
be
a
House
of
Reformation
for
Juvenile
Offenders
.
<EOS>
They
be
both
under
the
same
roof
,
but
the
two
class
of
boy
never
come
in
contact
.
   
<EOS>
the
Boylston
boy
,
as
may
be
readily
suppose
,
have
very
much
the
advantage
of
the
other
in
point
of
personal
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
in
their
school
-
room
when
I
come
upon
them
,
and
answer
correctly
,
without
book
,
such
question
as
where
be
England
;
how
far
be
it
;
what
be
its
population
;
its
capital
city
;
its
form
of
government
;
and
so
forth
.
 
<EOS>
They
sing
a
song
too
,
about
a
farmer
sow
his
seed
:
 
with
corresponding
action
at
such
part
as
"
'
tis
<EOS>
thus
he
sow
,
"
"
he
turn
him
round
,
"
"
he
clap
his
hand
;
"
which
give
it
great
interest
for
them
,
and
accustom
them
to
act
together
,
in
an
orderly
manner
.
 
<EOS>
They
appear
exceedingly
well
-
teach
,
and
not
better
teach
than
fed
;
for
a
more
chubby
-
look
full
-
waistcoated
set
of
boy
,
I
never
see
.
   
<EOS>
the
juvenile
offender
have
not
such
pleasant
face
by
a
great
deal
,
and
in
this
establishment
there
be
many
boy
of
colour
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
them
first
at
their
work
(
basket
-
making
,
and
the
manufacture
of
palm
-
leaf
hat
)
,
afterwards
in
their
school
,
where
they
sing
a
chorus
in
praise
of
Liberty
:
 
an
odd
,
and
,
one
would
think
,
rather
aggravate
,
theme
for
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
these
boy
be
divide
into
four
class
,
each
denote
by
a
numeral
,
wear
on
a
badge
upon
the
arm
.
<EOS>
on
the
arrival
of
a
new
-
comer
,
he
be
put
into
the
fourth
or
low
class
,
and
leave
,
by
good
behaviour
,
to
work
his
way
up
into
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
the
design
and
object
of
this
institution
be
to
reclaim
the
youthful
criminal
by
firm
but
kind
and
judicious
treatment
;
to
make
his
prison
a
place
of
purification
and
improvement
,
not
of
demoralisation
and
corruption
;
to
impress
upon
him
that
there
be
but
one
path
,
and
that
one
sober
industry
,
which
can
ever
lead
him
to
happiness
;
to
teach
him
how
it
may
be
trodden
,
if
his
footstep
have
never
yet
be
lead
that
way
;
and
to
lure
him
back
to
it
if
they
have
stray
:
 
in
a
word
,
to
snatch
him
from
destruction
,
and
restore
him
to
society
a
penitent
and
useful
member
.
 
<EOS>
the
importance
of
such
an
establishment
,
in
every
point
of
view
,
and
with
reference
to
every
consideration
of
humanity
and
social
policy
,
require
no
comment
.
   
<EOS>
one
other
establishment
close
the
catalogue
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
House
of
Correction
for
the
State
,
in
which
silence
be
strictly
maintain
,
but
where
the
prisoner
have
the
comfort
and
mental
relief
of
see
each
other
,
and
of
work
together
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
improved
system
of
Prison
Discipline
which
we
have
import
into
England
,
and
which
have
be
in
successful
operation
among
us
for
some
year
past
.
   
<EOS>
America
,
as
a
new
and
not
over
-
populate
country
,
have
in
all
her
prison
,
the
one
great
advantage
,
of
be
enable
to
find
useful
and
profitable
work
for
the
inmate
;
whereas
,
with
us
,
the
prejudice
against
prison
labour
be
naturally
very
strong
,
and
almost
insurmountable
,
when
honest
man
who
have
not
offend
against
the
law
be
frequently
doom
to
seek
employment
in
vain
.
<EOS>
even
in
the
United
States
,
the
principle
of
bring
convict
labour
and
free
labour
into
a
competition
which
must
obviously
be
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
latter
,
have
already
find
many
opponent
,
whose
number
be
not
likely
to
diminish
with
access
of
year
.
   
<EOS>
for
this
very
reason
though
,
our
good
prison
would
seem
at
the
first
glance
to
be
better
conduct
than
those
of
America
.
 
<EOS>
the
treadmill
be
conduct
with
little
or
no
noise
;
five
hundred
man
may
pick
oakum
in
the
same
room
,
without
a
sound
;
and
both
kind
of
labour
admit
of
such
keen
and
vigilant
superintendence
,
as
will
render
even
a
word
of
personal
communication
amongst
the
prisoner
almost
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
other
hand
,
the
noise
of
the
loom
,
the
forge
,
the
carpenter
's
hammer
,
or
the
stonemason
's
see
,
greatly
favour
those
opportunity
of
intercourse
---
hurried
and
brief
no
doubt
,
but
opportunity
still
---
which
these
several
kind
of
work
,
by
render
it
necessary
for
man
to
be
employ
very
near
to
each
other
,
and
often
side
by
side
,
without
any
barrier
or
partition
between
them
,
in
their
very
nature
present
.
 
<EOS>
a
visitor
,
too
,
require
to
reason
and
reflect
a
little
,
before
the
sight
of
a
number
of
man
engage
in
ordinary
labour
,
such
as
he
be
accustomed
to
out
of
door
,
will
impress
him
half
as
strongly
as
the
contemplation
of
the
same
person
in
the
same
place
and
garb
would
,
if
they
be
occupy
in
some
task
,
marked
and
degrade
everywhere
as
belong
only
to
felon
in
jail
.
 
<EOS>
in
an
american
state
prison
or
house
of
correction
,
I
find
it
difficult
at
first
to
persuade
myself
that
I
be
really
in
a
jail
:
 
a
place
of
ignominious
punishment
and
endurance
.
 
<EOS>
and
to
this
hour
I
very
much
question
whether
the
humane
boast
that
it
be
not
like
one
<EOS>
,
have
its
root
in
the
true
wisdom
or
philosophy
of
the
matter
.
   
<EOS>
I
hope
I
may
not
be
misunderstood
on
this
subject
,
for
it
be
one
in
which
I
take
a
strong
and
deep
interest
.
 
<EOS>
I
incline
as
little
to
the
sickly
feeling
which
make
every
canting
lie
or
maudlin
speech
of
a
notorious
criminal
a
subject
of
newspaper
report
and
general
sympathy
,
as
I
do
to
those
good
old
custom
of
the
good
old
time
which
make
England
,
even
so
recently
as
in
the
reign
of
the
Third
King
George
,
in
respect
of
her
criminal
code
and
her
prison
regulation
,
one
of
the
most
bloody
-
minded
and
barbarous
country
on
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
think
it
would
do
any
good
to
the
rise
generation
,
I
would
cheerfully
give
my
consent
to
the
disinterment
of
the
bone
of
any
genteel
highwayman
(
the
more
genteel
,
the
more
cheerfully
)
,
and
to
their
exposure
,
piecemeal
,
on
any
sign
-
post
,
gate
,
or
gibbet
,
that
may
be
deem
a
good
elevation
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
My
reason
be
as
well
convinced
that
these
gentry
be
as
utterly
worthless
and
debauch
villain
,
as
it
be
that
the
law
and
jail
harden
them
in
their
evil
course
,
or
that
their
wonderful
escape
be
effect
by
the
prison
-
turnkey
who
,
in
those
admirable
day
,
have
always
be
felon
themselves
,
and
be
,
to
the
last
,
their
bosom
-
friend
and
pot
-
companion
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
I
know
,
as
all
man
do
or
should
,
that
the
subject
of
Prison
Discipline
be
one
of
the
high
importance
to
any
community
;
and
that
in
her
sweeping
reform
and
bright
example
to
other
country
on
this
head
,
America
have
show
great
wisdom
,
great
benevolence
,
and
exalted
policy
.
 
<EOS>
in
contrast
her
system
with
that
which
we
have
model
upon
it
,
I
merely
seek
to
show
that
with
all
its
drawback
,
our
have
some
advantage
of
its
own
.
   
<EOS>
the
House
of
Correction
which
have
lead
to
these
remark
,
be
not
wall
,
like
other
prison
,
but
be
palisade
round
about
with
tall
rough
stake
,
something
after
the
manner
of
an
enclosure
for
keep
elephant
in
,
as
we
see
it
represent
in
eastern
print
and
picture
.
 
<EOS>
the
prisoner
wear
a
parti
-
coloured
dress
;
and
those
who
be
sentence
to
hard
labour
,
work
at
nail
-
making
,
or
stone
-
cutting
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
there
,
the
latter
class
of
labourer
be
employ
upon
the
stone
for
a
new
custom
-
house
in
course
of
erection
at
Boston
.
 
<EOS>
They
appear
to
shape
it
skilfully
and
with
expedition
,
though
there
be
very
few
among
them
(
if
any
)
who
have
not
acquire
the
art
within
the
prison
gate
.
   
<EOS>
the
woman
,
all
in
one
large
room
,
be
employ
in
make
light
clothing
,
for
New
Orleans
and
the
Southern
States
.
 
<EOS>
They
do
their
work
in
silence
like
the
man
;
and
like
them
be
over
-
look
by
the
person
contract
for
their
labour
,
or
by
some
agent
of
his
appointment
.
 
<EOS>
in
addition
to
this
,
they
be
every
moment
liable
to
be
visit
by
the
prison
officer
appoint
for
that
purpose
.
   
<EOS>
the
arrangement
for
cooking
,
washing
of
clothe
,
and
so
forth
,
be
much
upon
the
plan
of
those
I
have
see
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
Their
mode
of
bestow
the
prisoner
at
night
(
which
be
of
general
adoption
)
differ
from
our
,
and
be
both
simple
and
effective
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
centre
of
a
lofty
area
,
light
by
window
in
the
four
wall
,
be
five
tier
of
cell
,
one
above
the
other
;
each
tier
have
before
it
a
light
iron
gallery
,
attainable
by
stair
of
the
same
construction
and
material
:
 
<EOS>
except
the
low
one
,
which
be
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
behind
these
,
back
to
back
with
them
and
face
the
opposite
wall
,
be
five
corresponding
row
of
cell
,
accessible
by
similar
mean
:
so
that
suppose
the
prisoner
lock
up
in
their
cell
,
an
officer
station
on
the
ground
,
with
his
back
to
the
wall
,
have
half
their
number
under
his
eye
at
once
;
the
remain
half
be
equally
under
the
observation
of
another
officer
on
the
opposite
side
;
and
all
in
one
great
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
unless
this
watch
be
corrupt
or
sleep
on
his
post
,
it
be
impossible
for
a
man
to
escape
;
for
even
in
the
event
of
his
force
the
iron
door
of
his
cell
without
noise
(
which
be
exceedingly
improbable
)
,
the
moment
he
appear
outside
,
and
step
into
that
one
of
the
five
gallery
on
which
it
be
situate
,
he
must
be
plainly
and
fully
visible
to
the
officer
below
.
 
<EOS>
each
of
these
cell
hold
a
small
truckle
bed
,
in
which
one
prisoner
sleep
;
never
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
small
,
of
course
;
and
the
door
be
not
solid
,
but
grate
,
and
without
blind
or
curtain
,
the
prisoner
within
be
at
all
time
expose
to
the
observation
and
inspection
of
any
guard
who
may
pass
along
that
tier
at
any
hour
or
minute
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
every
day
,
the
prisoner
receive
their
dinner
,
singly
,
through
a
trap
in
the
kitchen
wall
;
and
each
man
carry
his
to
his
sleep
cell
to
eat
it
,
where
he
be
lock
up
,
alone
,
for
that
purpose
,
one
hour
.
 
<EOS>
the
whole
of
this
arrangement
strike
me
as
be
admirable
;
and
I
hope
that
the
next
new
prison
we
erect
in
England
may
be
build
on
this
plan
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
give
to
understand
that
in
this
prison
no
sword
or
fire
-
arm
,
or
even
cudgel
,
be
keep
;
nor
be
it
probable
that
,
so
long
as
its
present
excellent
management
continue
,
any
weapon
,
offensive
or
defensive
,
will
ever
be
require
within
its
bound
.
   
<EOS>
such
be
the
institution
at
South
Boston
!
 
<EOS>
in
all
of
them
,
the
unfortunate
or
degenerate
citizen
of
the
state
be
carefully
instruct
in
their
duty
both
to
God
and
man
;
be
surround
by
all
reasonable
mean
of
comfort
and
happiness
that
their
condition
will
admit
of
;
be
appeal
to
,
as
member
of
the
great
human
family
,
however
afflict
,
indigent
,
or
fall
;
be
rule
by
the
strong
heart
,
and
not
by
the
strong
(
though
immeasurably
weak
)
Hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
describe
them
at
some
length
;
firstly
,
because
their
worth
demand
it
;
and
secondly
,
because
I
mean
to
take
them
for
a
model
,
and
to
content
myself
with
say
of
other
we
may
come
to
,
whose
design
and
purpose
be
the
same
,
that
in
this
or
that
respect
they
practically
fail
,
or
differ
.
   
<EOS>
I
wish
by
this
account
of
them
,
imperfect
in
its
execution
,
but
in
its
just
intention
,
honest
,
I
could
hope
to
convey
to
my
reader
one
-
hundredth
part
of
the
gratification
,
the
sight
I
have
describe
,
afford
me
.
   
<EOS>
to
an
Englishman
,
accustom
to
the
paraphernalia
of
Westminster
Hall
,
an
American
Court
of
Law
be
as
odd
a
sight
as
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
an
English
Court
of
Law
would
be
to
an
American
.
 
<EOS>
except
in
the
Supreme
Court
at
Washington
(
where
the
judge
wear
a
plain
black
robe
)
,
there
be
no
such
thing
as
a
wig
or
gown
connect
with
the
administration
of
justice
.
 
<EOS>
the
gentleman
of
the
bar
be
barrister
and
attorney
too
<EOS>
(
for
there
be
no
division
of
those
function
as
in
England
)
be
no
more
removed
from
their
client
than
attorney
in
our
Court
for
the
Relief
of
Insolvent
Debtors
be
,
from
theirs
.
 
<EOS>
the
jury
be
quite
at
home
,
and
make
themselves
as
comfortable
as
circumstance
will
permit
.
 
<EOS>
the
witness
be
so
little
elevated
above
,
or
put
aloof
from
,
the
crowd
in
the
court
,
that
a
stranger
enter
during
a
pause
in
the
proceeding
would
find
it
difficult
to
pick
him
out
from
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
it
chance
to
be
a
criminal
trial
,
his
eye
,
in
nine
case
out
of
ten
,
would
wander
to
the
dock
in
search
of
the
prisoner
,
in
vain
;
for
that
gentleman
would
most
likely
be
lounge
among
the
most
distinguished
ornament
of
the
legal
profession
,
whisper
suggestion
in
his
counsel
's
ear
,
or
make
a
toothpick
out
of
an
old
quill
with
his
penknife
.
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
notice
these
difference
,
when
I
visit
the
court
at
Boston
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
much
surprised
at
first
,
too
,
to
observe
that
the
counsel
who
interrogate
the
witness
under
examination
at
the
time
,
do
so
sitting
.
 
<EOS>
but
see
that
he
be
also
occupy
in
write
down
the
answer
,
and
remember
that
he
be
alone
and
have
no
"
junior
,
"
I
quickly
console
myself
with
the
reflection
that
law
be
not
quite
so
expensive
an
article
here
,
as
at
home
;
and
that
the
absence
of
sundry
formality
which
we
regard
as
indispensable
,
have
doubtless
a
very
favourable
influence
upon
the
bill
of
cost
.
   
<EOS>
in
every
Court
,
ample
and
commodious
provision
be
make
for
the
accommodation
of
the
citizen
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
case
all
through
America
.
 
<EOS>
in
every
Public
Institution
,
the
right
of
the
people
to
attend
,
and
to
have
an
interest
in
the
proceeding
,
be
most
fully
and
distinctly
recognise
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
grim
door
-
keeper
to
dole
out
their
tardy
civility
by
the
sixpenny
-
worth
;
nor
be
there
,
I
sincerely
believe
,
any
insolence
of
office
of
any
kind
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
national
be
exhibit
for
money
;
and
no
public
officer
be
a
showman
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
begin
of
late
year
to
imitate
this
good
example
.
<EOS>
I
hope
we
shall
continue
to
do
so
;
and
that
in
the
fulness
of
time
,
even
dean
and
chapter
may
be
convert
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
civil
court
an
action
be
try
,
for
damage
sustain
in
some
accident
upon
a
railway
.
 
<EOS>
the
witness
have
be
examine
,
and
counsel
be
address
the
jury
.
 
<EOS>
the
learn
gentleman
(
like
a
few
of
his
English
brother
)
be
desperately
long
-
winded
,
and
have
a
remarkable
capacity
of
say
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
.
<EOS>
His
great
theme
be
"
Warren
the
ENGINE
driver
,
"
whom
he
press
into
the
service
of
every
sentence
he
utter
.
 
<EOS>
I
listen
to
him
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
;
and
,
come
out
of
court
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
,
without
the
faint
ray
of
enlightenment
as
to
the
merit
of
the
case
<EOS>
,
feel
as
if
I
be
at
home
again
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
prisoner
's
cell
,
wait
to
be
examine
by
the
magistrate
on
a
charge
of
theft
,
be
a
boy
.
 
<EOS>
this
lad
,
instead
of
be
commit
to
a
common
jail
,
would
be
send
to
the
asylum
at
South
Boston
,
and
there
teach
a
trade
;
and
in
the
course
of
time
he
would
be
bind
apprentice
to
some
respectable
master
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
his
detection
in
this
offence
,
instead
of
be
the
prelude
to
a
life
of
infamy
and
a
miserable
death
,
would
lead
,
there
be
a
reasonable
hope
,
to
his
being
reclaim
from
vice
,
and
become
a
worthy
member
of
society
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
by
no
mean
a
wholesale
admirer
of
our
legal
solemnity
,
many
of
which
impress
me
as
be
exceedingly
ludicrous
.
 
<EOS>
Strange
as
it
may
seem
too
<EOS>
,
there
be
undoubtedly
a
degree
of
protection
in
the
wig
and
gown
---
a
dismissal
of
individual
responsibility
in
dress
for
the
part
---
which
encourage
that
insolent
bearing
and
language
,
and
that
gross
perversion
of
the
office
of
a
pleader
for
the
Truth
,
so
frequent
in
our
court
of
law
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
I
can
not
help
doubt
whether
America
,
in
her
desire
to
shake
off
the
absurdity
and
abuse
of
the
old
system
,
may
not
have
go
too
far
into
the
opposite
extreme
;
and
whether
it
be
not
desirable
,
especially
in
the
small
community
of
a
city
like
this
,
where
each
man
know
the
other
,
to
surround
the
administration
of
justice
with
some
artificial
barrier
against
the
"
Hail
fellow
,
well
meet
"
deportment
of
everyday
life
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
aid
it
can
have
in
the
very
high
character
and
ability
of
the
Bench
,
not
only
here
but
elsewhere
<EOS>
,
it
have
,
and
well
deserve
to
have
;
but
it
may
need
something
more
:
not
to
impress
the
thoughtful
and
the
well
-
inform
,
but
the
ignorant
and
heedless
;
a
class
which
include
some
prisoner
and
many
witness
.
 
<EOS>
these
institution
be
establish
,
no
doubt
,
upon
the
principle
that
those
who
have
so
large
a
share
in
make
the
law
,
would
certainly
respect
them
.
 
<EOS>
but
experience
have
prove
this
hope
to
be
fallacious
;
for
no
man
know
better
than
the
judge
of
America
,
that
on
the
occasion
of
any
great
popular
excitement
the
law
be
powerless
,
and
can
not
,
for
the
time
,
assert
its
own
supremacy
.
   
<EOS>
the
tone
of
society
in
Boston
be
one
of
perfect
politeness
,
courtesy
,
and
good
breeding
.
 
<EOS>
the
lady
be
unquestionably
very
beautiful
---
in
face
:
 
<EOS>
but
there
I
be
compel
to
stop
.
 
<EOS>
Their
education
be
much
as
with
us
;
neither
better
nor
bad
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hear
some
very
marvellous
story
in
this
respect
;
but
not
believe
them
,
be
not
disappoint
.
 
<EOS>
blue
lady
there
be
,
in
Boston
;
but
like
philosopher
of
that
colour
and
sex
in
most
other
latitude
,
they
rather
desire
to
be
think
superior
than
to
be
so
.
<EOS>
evangelical
lady
there
be
,
likewise
,
whose
attachment
to
the
form
of
religion
,
and
horror
of
theatrical
entertainment
,
be
most
exemplary
.
 
<EOS>
lady
who
have
a
passion
for
attend
lecture
be
to
be
find
among
all
class
and
all
condition
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
kind
of
provincial
life
which
prevail
in
city
such
as
this
,
the
pulpit
have
great
influence
.
 
<EOS>
the
peculiar
province
of
the
Pulpit
in
New
England
(
always
except
the
Unitarian
Ministry
)
would
appear
to
be
the
denouncement
of
all
innocent
and
rational
amusement
.
<EOS>
the
church
,
the
chapel
,
and
the
lecture
-
room
,
be
the
only
mean
of
excitement
except
;
and
to
the
church
,
the
chapel
,
and
the
lecture
-
room
,
the
lady
resort
in
crowd
.
   
<EOS>
wherever
religion
be
resort
to
,
as
a
strong
drink
,
and
as
an
escape
from
the
dull
monotonous
round
of
home
,
those
of
its
minister
who
pepper
the
high
will
be
the
sure
to
please
.
<EOS>
They
who
strew
the
Eternal
Path
with
the
great
amount
of
brimstone
,
and
who
most
ruthlessly
tread
down
the
flower
and
leave
that
grow
by
the
wayside
,
will
be
vote
the
most
righteous
;
and
they
who
enlarge
with
the
great
pertinacity
on
the
difficulty
of
get
into
heaven
,
will
be
consider
by
all
true
believer
certain
of
go
there
:
 
though
it
would
be
hard
to
say
by
what
process
of
reason
this
conclusion
be
arrive
at
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
so
at
home
,
and
it
be
so
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
with
regard
to
the
other
mean
of
excitement
,
the
Lecture
,
it
have
at
least
the
merit
of
be
always
new
.
 
<EOS>
one
lecture
tread
so
quickly
on
the
heel
of
another
,
that
none
be
remember
;
and
the
course
of
this
month
may
be
safely
repeat
next
,
with
its
charm
of
novelty
unbroken
,
and
its
interest
unabate
.
   
<EOS>
the
fruit
of
the
earth
have
their
growth
in
corruption
.
 
<EOS>
out
of
the
rottenness
of
these
thing
,
there
have
spring
up
in
Boston
a
sect
of
philosopher
know
as
Transcendentalists
.
 
<EOS>
on
inquire
what
this
appellation
may
be
suppose
to
signify
,
I
be
give
to
understand
that
whatever
be
unintelligible
would
be
certainly
transcendental
.
 
<EOS>
not
derive
much
comfort
from
this
elucidation
,
I
pursue
the
inquiry
still
further
,
and
find
that
the
transcendentalist
be
follower
of
my
friend
Mr
Carlyle
,
or
I
should
rather
say
,
of
a
follower
of
his
,
Mr
Ralph
Waldo
Emerson
.
<EOS>
this
gentleman
have
write
a
volume
of
essay
,
in
which
,
among
much
that
be
dreamy
and
fanciful
<EOS>
(
if
he
will
pardon
me
for
say
so
)
,
there
be
much
more
that
be
true
and
manly
,
honest
and
bold
.
<EOS>
Transcendentalism
have
its
occasional
vagary
(
what
school
have
not
?
)
,
but
it
have
good
healthful
quality
in
spite
of
them
;
not
least
among
the
number
a
hearty
disgust
of
can
not
,
and
an
aptitude
to
detect
her
in
all
the
million
variety
of
her
everlasting
wardrobe
.
 
<EOS>
and
therefore
if
I
be
a
Bostonian
,
I
think
I
would
be
a
Transcendentalist
.
   
<EOS>
the
only
preacher
I
hear
in
Boston
be
Mr
Taylor
,
who
address
himself
peculiarly
to
seamen
,
and
who
be
once
a
mariner
himself
.
<EOS>
I
find
his
chapel
down
among
the
shipping
,
in
one
of
the
narrow
,
old
,
water
-
side
street
,
with
a
gay
blue
flag
wave
freely
from
its
roof
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
gallery
opposite
to
the
pulpit
be
a
little
choir
of
male
and
female
singer
,
a
violoncello
,
and
a
violin
.
 
<EOS>
the
preacher
already
sit
in
the
pulpit
,
which
be
raise
on
pillar
,
and
ornament
behind
him
with
paint
drapery
of
a
lively
and
somewhat
theatrical
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
a
weather
-
beat
hard
-
featured
man
,
of
about
six
or
eight
and
fifty
;
with
deep
line
grave
as
it
be
into
his
face
,
dark
hair
,
and
a
stern
,
keen
eye
.
<EOS>
yet
the
general
character
of
his
countenance
be
pleasant
and
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
the
service
commence
with
a
hymn
,
to
which
succeed
an
extemporary
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
the
fault
of
frequent
repetition
,
incidental
to
all
such
prayer
;
but
it
be
plain
and
comprehensive
in
its
doctrine
,
and
breathe
a
tone
of
general
sympathy
and
charity
,
which
be
not
so
commonly
a
characteristic
of
this
form
of
address
to
the
Deity
as
it
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
that
do
he
open
his
discourse
,
take
for
his
text
a
passage
from
the
Song
of
Solomon
,
lay
upon
the
desk
before
the
commencement
of
the
service
by
some
unknown
member
of
the
congregation
:
 
<EOS>
"
who
be
this
come
up
from
the
wilderness
,
lean
on
the
arm
of
her
beloved
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
handle
his
text
in
all
kind
of
way
,
and
twist
it
into
all
manner
of
shape
;
but
always
ingeniously
,
and
with
a
rude
eloquence
,
well
adapt
to
the
comprehension
of
his
hearer
.
<EOS>
indeed
if
I
be
not
mistaken
,
he
study
their
sympathy
and
understanding
much
more
than
the
display
of
his
own
power
.
 
<EOS>
His
imagery
be
all
draw
from
the
sea
,
and
from
the
incident
of
a
seaman
's
life
;
and
be
often
remarkably
good
.
 
<EOS>
He
speak
to
them
of
"
that
glorious
man
,
Lord
Nelson
,
"
and
of
Collingwood
;
and
draw
nothing
in
,
as
the
saying
be
,
by
the
head
and
shoulder
,
but
bring
it
to
bear
upon
his
purpose
,
naturally
,
and
with
a
sharp
mind
to
its
effect
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
when
much
excited
with
his
subject
,
he
have
an
odd
way
---
compound
of
John
Bunyan
,
and
Balfour
of
Burley
---
of
take
his
great
quarto
Bible
under
his
arm
and
pace
up
and
down
the
pulpit
with
it
;
look
steadily
down
,
meantime
,
into
the
midst
of
the
congregation
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
when
he
apply
his
text
to
the
first
assemblage
of
his
hearer
,
and
picture
the
wonder
of
the
church
at
their
presumption
in
form
a
congregation
among
themselves
,
he
stop
short
with
his
Bible
under
his
arm
in
the
manner
I
have
describe
,
and
pursue
his
discourse
after
this
manner
:
   
<EOS>
"
who
be
these
---
who
be
they
---
who
be
these
fellow
?
<EOS>
where
do
they
come
from
?
 
<EOS>
where
be
they
go
to
?
<EOS>
---
come
from
!
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
answer
?
"
<EOS>
---
lean
out
of
the
pulpit
,
and
point
downward
with
his
right
hand
:
 
"
from
below
!
"
---
start
back
again
,
and
look
at
the
sailor
before
him
:
 
"
from

"
<EOS>
---
raise
his
hand
higher
,
and
high
,
at
every
repetition
of
the
word
,
so
that
he
stand
with
it
at
last
stretch
above
his
head
,
regard
them
in
a
strange
,
rapt
manner
,
and
press
the
book
triumphantly
to
his
breast
,
until
he
gradually
subside
into
some
other
portion
of
his
discourse
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
cite
this
,
rather
as
an
instance
of
the
preacher
's
eccentricity
than
his
merit
,
though
take
in
connection
with
his
look
and
manner
,
and
the
character
of
his
audience
,
even
this
be
strike
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
possible
,
however
,
that
my
favourable
impression
of
him
may
have
be
greatly
influence
and
strengthen
,
firstly
,
by
his
impress
upon
his
hearer
that
the
true
observance
of
religion
be
not
inconsistent
with
a
cheerful
deportment
and
an
exact
discharge
of
the
duty
of
their
station
,
which
,
indeed
,
it
scrupulously
require
of
them
;
and
secondly
,
by
his
caution
them
not
to
set
up
any
monopoly
in
Paradise
and
its
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
hear
these
two
point
so
wisely
touch
(
if
indeed
I
have
ever
hear
them
touch
at
all
)
,
by
any
preacher
of
that
kind
before
.
   
<EOS>
have
pass
the
time
I
spend
in
Boston
,
in
make
myself
acquaint
with
these
thing
,
in
settle
the
course
I
should
take
in
my
future
travel
,
and
in
mix
constantly
with
its
society
,
I
be
not
aware
that
I
have
any
occasion
to
prolong
this
chapter
.
<EOS>
such
of
its
social
custom
as
I
have
not
mention
,
however
,
may
be
tell
in
a
very
few
word
.
   
<EOS>
the
usual
dinner
-
hour
be
two
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
a
dinner
party
take
place
at
five
;
and
at
an
evening
party
,
they
seldom
sup
later
than
eleven
;
so
that
it
go
hard
but
one
get
home
,
even
from
a
rout
,
by
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
could
find
out
any
difference
between
a
party
at
Boston
and
a
party
in
London
,
save
that
at
the
former
place
all
assembly
be
hold
at
more
rational
hour
;
that
the
conversation
may
possibly
be
a
little
louder
and
more
cheerful
;
and
a
guest
be
usually
expect
to
ascend
to
the
very
top
of
the
house
to
take
his
cloak
off
;
that
he
be
certain
to
see
,
at
every
dinner
,
an
unusual
amount
of
poultry
on
the
table
;
and
at
every
supper
,
at
least
two
mighty
bowl
of
hot
stewed
oyster
,
in
any
one
of
which
a
half
-
grown
Duke
of
Clarence
may
be
smother
easily
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
two
theatre
in
Boston
,
of
good
size
and
construction
,
but
sadly
in
want
of
patronage
.
 
<EOS>
the
few
lady
who
resort
to
them
,
sit
,
as
of
right

in
the
front
row
of
the
box

<EOS>
the
bar
be
a
large
room
with
a
stone
floor
,
and
there
people
stand
and
smoke
,
and
lounge
about
,
all
the
evening
:
 
drop
in
and
out
as
the
humour
take
them
.
 
<EOS>
there
too
the
stranger

initiate
into
the

of
Gin

Cock

Sangaree

Mint
Julep

Sherry

<EOS>
the

both
married
and
single

many
of
whom
sleep
upon
the
premise

and
contract
by
the
week
for
their
board
and
lodging
:
the
charge
for
which
diminish
as
they
go
nearer
the
sky
to
roost
.
<EOS>
a
public
table
be
lay
in
a
very
handsome
hall
for
breakfast
,
and
for
dinner
,
and
for
supper
.
 
<EOS>
the
party
sit
down
together
to
these
meal
will
vary
in
number
from
one
to
two
hundred
:
 
sometimes
more
.
 
<EOS>
the
advent
of
each
of
these
epochs
in
the
day
be
proclaim
by
an
awful
gong
,
which
shake
the
very
window

frame
as
it
reverberate
through
the
house
,
and
horribly
disturb
nervous
foreigner
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
ordinary
for
lady
,
and
an
ordinary
for
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
in
our
private
room
the
cloth
could
not
,
for
any
earthly
consideration
,
have
be
lay
for
dinner
without
a
huge
glass
dish
of
cranberry
in
the
middle
of
the
table
;
and
breakfast
would
have
be
no
breakfast
unless
the
principal
dish
be
a
deform
beefsteak
with
a
great
flat
bone
in
the
centre
,
swim
in
hot
butter

and
sprinkle
with
the
very
black
of
all
possible
pepper

<EOS>
Our
bedroom
be
spacious
and
airy
,
but
(
like
every
bedroom
on
this
side
of
the
Atlantic
)
very
bare
of
furniture
,
have
no
curtain
to
the
french
bedstead
or
to
the
window

<EOS>
It
have
one
unusual
luxury
,
however
,
in
the
shape
of
a
wardrobe
of
paint
wood
,
something
small
than
an
english
watch

box
;
or
if
this
comparison
should
be
insufficient
to
convey
a
just
idea
of
its
dimension
,
they
may
be
estimate
from
the
fact
of
my
have
live
for
fourteen
day

night
in
the
firm
belief
that
it

Chapter
04
.
<EOS>
an
american
Railroad
.
 
<EOS>
Lowell
and
Its
Factory
System
 
<EOS>
before
leave
Boston
,
I
devote
one
day
to
an
excursion
to
Lowell
.
<EOS>
I
assign
a
separate
chapter
to
this
visit
;
not
because
I
be
about
to
describe
it
at
any
great
length
,
but
because
I
remember
it
as
a
thing
by
itself
,
and
be
desirous
that
my
reader
should
do
the
same
.
   
<EOS>
I
make
acquaintance
with
an
american
railroad
,
on
this
occasion
,
for
the
first
time
.
 
<EOS>
as
these
work
be
pretty
much
alike
all
through
the
States
,
their
general
characteristic
be
easily
describe
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
no
first
and
second
class
carriage
as
with
us
;
but
there
be
a
gentleman
's
car
and
a
lady
'
car
:
 
the
main
distinction
between
which
be
that
in
the
first
,
everybody
smoke
;
and
in
the
second
,
nobody
do
.
 
<EOS>
as
a
black
man
never
travel
with
a
white
one
,
there
be
also
a
negro
car
;
which
be
a
great
,
blunder
,
clumsy
chest
,
such
as
Gulliver
put
to
sea
in
,
from
the
kingdom
of
Brobdingnag
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
deal
of
jolting
,
a
great
deal
of
noise
,
a
great
deal
of
wall
,
not
much
window
,
a
locomotive
engine
,
a
shriek
,
and
a
bell
.
   
<EOS>
the
car
be
like
shabby
omnibus
,
but
large
:
 
hold
thirty
,
forty
,
fifty
,
people
.
 
<EOS>
the
seat
,
instead
of
stretch
from
end
to
end
,
be
place
crosswise
.
 
<EOS>
each
seat
hold
two
person
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
long
row
of
them
on
each
side
of
the
caravan
,
a
narrow
passage
up
the
middle
,
and
a
door
at
both
end
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
centre
of
the
carriage
there
be
usually
a
stove
,
feed
with
charcoal
or
anthracite
coal
;
which
be
for
the
most
part
red
-
hot
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
insufferably
close
;
and
you
see
the
hot
air
flutter
between
yourself
and
any
other
object
you
may
happen
to
look
at
,
like
the
ghost
of
smoke
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
lady
'
car
,
there
be
a
great
many
gentleman
who
have
lady
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
also
a
great
many
lady
who
have
nobody
with
them
:
 
for
any
lady
may
travel
alone
,
from
one
end
of
the
United
States
to
the
other
,
and
be
certain
of
the
most
courteous
and
considerate
treatment
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
the
conductor
or
check
-
taker
,
or
guard
,
or
whatever
he
may
be
,
wear
no
uniform
.
 
<EOS>
He
walk
up
and
down
the
car
,
and
in
and
out
of
it
,
as
his
fancy
dictate
;
lean
against
the
door
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
stare
at
you
,
if
you
chance
to
be
a
stranger
;
or
enter
into
conversation
with
the
passenger
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
a
great
many
newspaper
be
pull
out
,
and
a
few
of
them
be
read
.
 
<EOS>
everybody
talk
to
you
,
or
to
anybody
else
who
hit
his
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
be
an
Englishman
,
he
expect
that
that
railroad
be
pretty
much
like
an
english
railroad
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
say
"
no
,
"
he
say
"
<EOS>
yes
?
"
(
interrogatively
)
,
and
ask
in
what
respect
they
differ
.
 
<EOS>
You
enumerate
the
head
of
difference
,
one
by
one
,
and
he
say
"
yes
?
"
<EOS>
(
still
interrogatively
)
to
each
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
guess
that
you
do
not
travel
faster
in
England
;
and
on
your
replying
that
you
do
,
say
"
<EOS>
yes
?
"
again
(
still
interrogatively
)
,
and
it
be
quite
evident
,
do
not
believe
it
.
 
<EOS>
after
a
long
pause
he
remark
,
partly
to
you
,
and
partly
to
the
knob
on
the
top
of
his
stick
,
that
"
Yankees
be
reckon
to
be
considerable
of
a
go
-
ahead
people
too
;
"
upon
which
you
say
"
yes
,
"
and
then
he
say
"
yes
"
again
(
affirmatively
this
time
)
;
and
upon
your
look
out
of
window
,
tell
you
that
behind
that
hill
,
and
some
three
mile
from
the
next
station
,
there
be
a
clever
town
in
a
smart
lo
-
ca
-
tion
,
where
he
expect
you
have
conclude
to
stop
.
 
<EOS>
Your
answer
in
the
negative
naturally
lead
to
more
question
in
reference
to
your
intend
route
<EOS>
(
always
pronounce
rout
)
;
and
wherever
you
be
go
,
you
invariably
learn
that
you
can
not
get
there
without
immense
difficulty
and
danger
,
and
that
all
the
great
sight
be
somewhere
else
.
   
<EOS>
if
a
lady
take
a
fancy
to
any
male
passenger
's
seat
,
the
gentleman
who
accompany
her
give
him
notice
of
the
fact
,
and
he
immediately
vacate
it
with
great
politeness
.
 
<EOS>
politic
be
much
discuss
,
so
be
bank
,
so
be
cotton
.
 
<EOS>
quiet
people
avoid
the
question
of
the
Presidency
,
for
there
will
be
a
new
election
in
three
year
and
a
half
,
and
party
feeling
run
very
high
:
 
the
great
constitutional
feature
of
this
institution
be
,
that
directly
the
acrimony
of
the
last
election
be
over
,
the
acrimony
of
the
next
one
begin
;
which
be
an
unspeakable
comfort
to
all
strong
politician
and
true
lover
of
their
country
:
 
that
be
to
say
,
to
ninety
-
nine
man
and
boy
out
of
every
ninety
-
nine
and
a
quarter
.
   
<EOS>
except
when
a
branch
road
join
the
main
one
,
there
be
seldom
more
than
one
track
of
rail
;
so
that
the
road
be
very
narrow
,
and
the
view
,
where
there
be
a
deep
cutting
,
by
no
means
extensive
.
 
<EOS>
when
there
be
not
,
the
character
of
the
scenery
be
always
the
same
.
<EOS>
mile
after
mile
of
stunted
tree
:
 
some
hew
down
by
the
axe
,
some
blow
down
by
the
wind
,
some
half
fallen
and
rest
on
their
neighbour
<EOS>
,
many
mere
log
half
hide
in
the
swamp
,
other
moulder
away
to
spongy
chip
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
soil
of
the
earth
be
make
up
of
minute
fragment
such
as
these
;
each
pool
of
stagnant
water
have
its
crust
of
vegetable
rottenness
;
on
every
side
there
be
the
bough
,
and
trunk
,
and
stump
of
tree
,
in
every
possible
stage
of
decay
,
decomposition
,
and
neglect
.
 
<EOS>
now
you
emerge
for
a
few
brief
minute
on
an
open
country
,
glitter
with
some
bright
lake
or
pool
,
broad
as
many
an
English
river
,
but
so
small
here
that
it
scarcely
have
a
name
;
now
catch
hasty
glimpse
of
a
distant
town
,
with
its
clean
white
house
and
their
cool
piazza
,
its
prim
New
England
church
and
school
-
house
;
when
whir
-
r
-
r
-
r
!
<EOS>
almost
before
you
have
see
them
,
come
the
same
dark
screen
:
 
<EOS>
the
stunt
tree
,
the
stump
,

down

<EOS>
I
be
meet
at
the
station
at
Lowell
by
a
gentleman
intimately
connect
with
the
management
of
the
factory
there
;
and
gladly
put
myself
under
his
guidance
,
drive
off
at
once
to
that
quarter
of
the
town
in
which
the
work
,
the
object
of
my
visit
,
be
situate
.
 
<EOS>
although
only
just
of
age
---
for
if
my
recollection
serve
me
,
it
have
be
a
manufacturing
town
barely
one
-
and
-
twenty
year
---
Lowell
be
a
large
,
populous
,
thriving
place
.
 
<EOS>
those
indication
of
its
youth
which
first
attract
the
eye
,
give
it
a
quaintness
and
oddity
of
character
which
,
to
a
visitor
from
the
old
country
,
be
amusing
enough
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
very
dirty
winter
's
day
,
and
nothing
in
the
whole
town
look
old
to
me
,
except
the
mud
,
which
in
some
part
be
almost
knee
-
deep
,
and
may
have
be
deposit
there
,
on
the
subsiding
of
the
water
after
the
Deluge
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
place
,
there
be
a
new
wooden
church
,
which
,
have
no
steeple
,
and
be
yet
unpainted
,
look
like
an
enormous
packing
-
case
without
any
direction
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
in
another
there
be
a
large
hotel
,
whose
wall
and
colonnade
be
so
crisp
,
and
thin
,
and
slight
,
that
it
have
exactly
the
appearance
of
be
build
with
card
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
careful
not
to
draw
my
breath
as
we
pass
,
and
tremble
when
I
see
a
workman
come
out
upon
the
roof
,
lest
with
one
thoughtless
stamp
of
his
foot
he
should
crush
the
structure
beneath
him
,
and
bring
it
rattle
down
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
river
that
move
the
machinery
in
the
mill
(
for
they
be
all
work
by
water
power
)
,
seem
to
acquire
a
new
character
from
the
fresh
building
of
bright
red
brick
and
paint
wood
among
which
it
take
its
course
;
and
to
be
as
light
-
head
,
thoughtless
,
and
brisk
a
young
river
,
in
its
murmuring
and
tumbling
,
as
one
would
desire
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
one
would
swear
that
every
"
Bakery
,
"
"
grocery
,
"
and
"
Bookbindery
,
"
and
other
kind
of
store
,
take
its
shutter
down
for
the
first
time
,
and
start
in
business
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
the
golden
pestle
and
mortar
fix
as
sign
upon
the
sun
-
blind
frame
outside
the
Druggists
'
,
 
appear
to
have
be
just
turn
out
of
the
United
States
'
Mint
;
and
when
I
see
a
baby
of
some
week
or
ten
day
old
in
a
woman
's
arm
at
a
street
corner
,
I
find
myself
unconsciously
wonder
where
it
come
from
:
 
never
suppose
for
an
instant
that
it
could
have
be
bear
in
such
a
young
town
as
that
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
several
factory
in
Lowell
,
each
of
which
belong
to
what
we
should
term
a
Company
of
Proprietors
,
but
what
they
call
in
America
a
Corporation
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
over
several
of
these
;
such
as
a
woollen
factory
,
a
carpet
factory
,
and
a
cotton
factory
:
 
<EOS>
examine
them
in
every
part
;
and
see
them
in
their
ordinary
working
aspect
,
with
no
preparation
of
any
kind
,
or
departure
from
their
ordinary
everyday
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
add
that
I
be
well
acquainted
with
our
manufacturing
town
in
England
,
and
have
visit
many
mill
in
Manchester
and
elsewhere
in
the
same
manner
.
   
<EOS>
I
happen
to
arrive
at
the
first
factory
just
as
the
dinner
hour
be
over
,
and
the
girl
be
return
to
their
work
;
indeed
the
stair
of
the
mill
be
throng
with
them
as
I
ascend
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
all
well
dressed
,
but
not
to
my
thinking
above
their
condition
;
for
I
like
to
see
the
humbler
class
of
society
careful
of
their
dress
and
appearance
,
and
even
,
if
they
please
,
decorate
with
such
little
trinket
as
come
within
the
compass
of
their
mean
.
 
<EOS>
suppose
it
confine
within
reasonable
limit
,
I
would
always
encourage
this
kind
of
pride
,
as
a
worthy
element
of
self
-
respect
,
in
any
person
I
employ
;
and
should
no
more
be
deter
from
do
so
,
because
some
wretched
female
refer
her
fall
to
a
love
of
dress
,
than
I
would
allow
my
construction
of
the
real
intent
and
meaning
of
the
Sabbath
to
be
influence
by
any
warning
to
the
well
-
dispose
,
found
on
his
backsliding
on
that
particular
day
,
which
may
emanate
from
the
rather
doubtful
authority
of
a
murderer
in
Newgate
.
   
<EOS>
these
girl
,
as
I
have
say
,
be
all
well
dressed
:
 
and
that
phrase
necessarily
include
extreme
cleanliness
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
serviceable
bonnet
,
good
warm
cloak
,
and
shawl
;
and
be
not
above
clog
and
patten
.
 
<EOS>
moreover
,
there
be
place
in
the
mill
in
which
they
could
deposit
these
thing
without
injury
;
and
there
be
convenience
for
washing
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
healthy
in
appearance
,
many
of
them
remarkably
so
,
and
have
the
manner
and
deportment
of
young
woman
:
 
not
of
degraded
brute
of
burden
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
see
in
one
of
those
mill
<EOS>
(
but
I
do
not
,
though
I
look
for
something
of
this
kind
with
a
sharp
eye
)
,
the
most
lisping
,
mince
,
affect
,
and
ridiculous
young
creature
that
my
imagination
could
suggest
,
I
should
have
think
of
the
careless
,
mope
,
<EOS>
slatternly
,
degraded
,
dull
reverse
(
I
have
see
that
)
,
and
should
have
be
still
well
pleased
to
look
upon
her
.
   
<EOS>
the
room
in
which
they
work
,
be
as
well
order
as
themselves
.
<EOS>
in
the
window
of
some
,
there
be
green
plant
,
which
be
train
to
shade
the
glass
;
in
all
,
there
be
as
much
fresh
air
,
cleanliness
,
and
comfort
,
as
the
nature
of
the
occupation
would
possibly
admit
of
.
 
<EOS>
out
of
so
large
a
number
of
female
,
many
of
whom
be
only
then
just
verge
upon
womanhood
,
it
may
be
reasonably
suppose
that
some
be
delicate
and
fragile
in
appearance
:
 
no
doubt
there
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
solemnly
declare
,
that
from
all
the
crowd
I
see
in
the
different
factory
that
day
,
I
can
not
recall
or
separate
one
young
face
that
give
me
a
painful
impression
;
not
one
young
girl
<EOS>
whom
,
assume
it
to
be
a
matter
of
necessity
that
she
should
gain
her
daily
bread
by
the
labour
of
her
hand
,
I
would
have
remove
from
those
work
if
I
have
have
the
power
.
   
<EOS>
They
reside
in
various
boarding
-
house
near
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
owner
of
the
mill
be
particularly
careful
to
allow
no
person
to
enter
upon
the
possession
of
these
house
,
whose
character
have
not
undergo
the
most
searching
and
thorough
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
any
complaint
that
be
make
against
them
,
by
the
boarder
,
or
by
any
one
else
,
be
fully
investigate
;
and
if
good
ground
of
complaint
be
show
to
exist
against
them
,
they
be
remove
,
and
their
occupation
be
hand
over
to
some
more
deserving
person
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
few
child
employ
in
these
factory
,
but
not
many
.
 
<EOS>
the
law
of
the
State
forbid
their
work
more
than
nine
month
in
the
year
,
and
require
that
they
be
educate
during
the
other
three
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
purpose
there
be
school
in
Lowell
;
and
there
be
church
and
chapel
of
various
persuasion
,
in
which
the
young
woman
may
observe
that
form
of
worship
in
which
they
have
be
educate
.
   
<EOS>
at
some
distance
from
the
factory
,
and
on
the
high
and
pleasantest
ground
in
the
neighbourhood
,
stand
their
hospital
,
or
boarding
-
house
for
the
sick
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
the
good
house
in
those
part
,
and
be
build
by
an
eminent
merchant
for
his
own
residence
.
 
<EOS>
like
that
institution
at
Boston
,
which
I
have
before
describe
,
it
be
not
parcel
out
into
ward
,
but
be
divide
into
convenient
chamber
,
each
of
which
have
all
the
comfort
of
a
very
comfortable
home
.
 
<EOS>
the
principal
medical
attendant
reside
under
the
same
roof
;
and
be
the
patient
member
of
his
own
family
,
they
could
not
be
better
care
for
,
or
attend
with
great
gentleness
and
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
the
weekly
charge
in
this
establishment
for
each
female
patient
be
three
dollar
,
or
twelve
shilling
English
;
but
no
girl
employ
by
any
of
the
corporation
be
ever
exclude
for
want
of
the
mean
of
payment
.
 
<EOS>
that
they
do
not
very
often
want
the
mean
,
may
be
gather
from
the
fact
,
that
in
July
,
1841
,
no
few
than
nine
hundred
and
seventy
-
eight
of
these
girl
be
depositor
in
the
Lowell
Savings
Bank
:
 
<EOS>
the
amount
of
whose
joint
saving
be
estimate
at
one
hundred
thousand
dollar
,
or
twenty
thousand
english
pound
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
now
go
to
state
three
fact
,
which
will
startle
a
large
class
of
reader
on
this
side
of
the
Atlantic
,
very
much
.
   
<EOS>
firstly
,
there
be
a
joint
-
stock
piano
in
a
great
many
of
the
boarding
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
secondly
,
nearly
all
these
young
lady
subscribe
to
circulate
library
.
 
<EOS>
thirdly
,
they
have
get
up
among
themselves
a
periodical
call
the
LOWELL
offering
,
"
a
repository
of
original
article
,
write
exclusively
by
female
actively
employ
in
the
mill
,
"
---
which
be
duly
print
,
publish
,
and
sell
;
and
whereof
I
bring
away
from
Lowell
four
hundred
good
solid
page
,
which
I
have
read
from
beginning
to
end
.
   
<EOS>
the
large
class
of
reader
,
startle
by
these
fact
,
will
exclaim
,
with
one
voice
,
"
how
very
preposterous
!
"
 
<EOS>
on
my
deferentially
inquire
why
,
they
will
answer
,
"
these
thing
be
above
their
station
.
"
 
<EOS>
in
reply
to
that
objection
,
I
would
beg
to
ask
what
their
station
be
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
their
station
to
work
.
 
<EOS>
and
they
do
work
.
 
<EOS>
They
labour
in
these
mill
,
upon
an
average
,
twelve
hour
a
day
,
which
be
unquestionably
work
,
and
pretty
tight
work
too
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
it
be
above
their
station
to
indulge
in
such
amusement
,
on
any
term
.
<EOS>
be
we
quite
sure
that
we
in
England
have
not
form
our
idea
of
the
"
station
"
of
work
people
,
from
accustom
ourselves
to
the
contemplation
of
that
class
as
they
be
,
and
not
as
they
may
be
?
<EOS>
I
think
that
if
we
examine
our
own
feeling
,
we
shall
find
that
the
piano
,
and
the
circulate
library
,
and
even
the
Lowell
Offering
,
startle
us
by
their
novelty
,
and
not
by
their
bearing
upon
any
abstract
question
of
right
or
wrong
.
   
<EOS>
for
myself
,
I
know
no
station
in
which
,
the
occupation
of
to
-
day
cheerfully
do
and
the
occupation
of
to
-
morrow
cheerfully
look
to
,
any
one
of
these
pursuit
be
not
most
humanising
and
laudable
.
<EOS>
I
know
no
station
which
be
render
more
endurable
to
the
person
in
it
,
or
more
safe
to
the
person
out
of
it
,
by
have
ignorance
for
its
associate
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
no
station
which
have
a
right
to
monopolise
the
mean
of
mutual
instruction
,
improvement
,
and
rational
entertainment
;
or
which
have
ever
continue
to
be
a
station
very
long
,
after
seek
to
do
so
.
   
<EOS>
of
the
merit
of
the
Lowell
Offering
as
a
literary
production
,
I
will
only
observe
,
put
entirely
out
of
sight
the
fact
of
the
article
have
be
write
by
these
girl
after
the
arduous
labour
of
the
day
,
that
it
will
compare
advantageously
with
a
great
many
English
Annuals
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
pleasant
to
find
that
many
of
its
Tales
be
of
the
Mills
and
of
those
who
work
in
them
;
that
they
inculcate
habit
of
self
-
denial
and
contentment
,
and
teach
good
doctrine
of
enlarge
benevolence
.
 
<EOS>
a
strong
feeling
for
the
beauty
of
nature
,
as
display
in
the
solitude
the
writer
have
leave
at
home
,
breathe
through
its
page
like
wholesome
village
air
;
and
though
a
circulate
library
be
a
favourable
school
for
the
study
of
such
topic
,
it
have
very
scant
allusion
to
fine
clothe
,
fine
marriage
,
fine
house
,
or
fine
life
.
 
<EOS>
some
person
may
object
to
the
paper
be
sign
occasionally
with
rather
fine
name
,
but
this
be
an
american
fashion
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
the
province
of
the
state
legislature
of
Massachusetts
be
to
alter
ugly
name
into
pretty
one
,
as
the
child
improve
upon
the
taste
of
their
parent
.
 
<EOS>
these
change
cost
little
or
nothing
,
score
of
Mary
Annes
be
solemnly
convert
into
Bevelinas
every
session
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
say
that
on
the
occasion
of
a
visit
from
General
Jackson
or
General
Harrison
to
this
town
(
I
forget
which
,
but
it
be
not
to
the
purpose
)
,
he
walk
through
three
mile
and
a
half
of
these
young
lady
all
dress
out
with
parasol
and
silk
stocking
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
I
be
not
aware
that
any
bad
consequence
ensue
,
than
a
sudden
looking
-
up
of
all
the
parasol
and
silk
stocking
in
the
market
;
and
perhaps
the
bankruptcy
of
some
speculative
New
Englander
who
buy
them
all
up
at
any
price
,
in
expectation
of
a
demand
that
never
come
;
I
set
no
great
store
by
the
circumstance
.
   
<EOS>
in
this
brief
account
of
Lowell
,
and
inadequate
expression
of
the
gratification
it
yield
me
,
and
can
not
fail
to
afford
to
any
foreigner
to
whom
the
condition
of
such
people
at
home
be
a
subject
of
interest
and
anxious
speculation
,
I
have
carefully
abstain
from
draw
a
comparison
between
these
factory
and
those
of
our
own
land
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
the
circumstance
whose
strong
influence
have
be
at
work
for
year
in
our
manufacturing
town
have
not
arise
here
;
and
there
be
no
manufacture
population
in
Lowell
,
so
to
speak
:
 
for
these
girl
<EOS>
(
often
the
daughter
of
small
farmer
)
come
from
other
States
,
remain
a
few
year
in
the
mill
,
and
then
go
home
for
good
.
   
<EOS>
the
contrast
would
be
a
strong
one
,
for
it
would
be
between
the
Good
and
Evil
,
the
living
light
and
deep
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
I
abstain
from
it
,
because
I
deem
it
just
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
only
the
more
earnestly
adjure
all
those
whose
eye
may
rest
on
these
page
,
to
pause
and
reflect
upon
the
difference
between
this
town
and
those
great
haunt
of
desperate
misery
:
 
to
call
to
mind
,
if
they
can
in
the
midst
of
party
strife
and
squabble
,
the
effort
that
must
be
make
to
purge
them
of
their
suffering
and
danger
:
 
and
last
,
and
foremost
,
to
remember
how
the
precious
time
be
rush
by
.
   
<EOS>
I
return
at
night
by
the
same
railroad
and
in
the
same
kind
of
car
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
the
passenger
be
exceedingly
anxious
to
expound
at
great
length
to
my
companion
(
not
to
me
,
of
course
)
<EOS>
the
true
principle
on
which
book
of
travel
in
America
should
be
write
by
Englishmen
<EOS>
,
I
feign
to
fall
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
but
glance
all
the
way
out
at
window
from
the
corner
of
my
eye
,
I
find
abundance
of
entertainment
for
the
rest
of
the
ride
in
watch
the
effect
of
the
wood
fire
,
which
have
be
invisible
in
the
morning
but
be
now
bring
out
in
full
relief
by
the
darkness
:
 
for
we
be
travel
in
a
whirlwind
of
bright
spark
,
which
shower
about
us
like
a
storm
of
fiery
snow

LEAVING
Boston
on
the
afternoon
of
Saturday
the
fifth
of
February
,
we
proceed
by
another
railroad
to
Worcester
:
 
<EOS>
a
pretty
New
England
town
,
where
we
have
arrange
to
remain
under
the
hospitable
roof
of
the
Governor
of
the
State
,
until
Monday
morning
.
   
<EOS>
these
town
and
city
of
New
England
(
many
of
which
would
be
village
in
Old
England
)
,
be
as
favourable
specimen
of
rural
America
,
as
their
people
be
of
rural
Americans
.
 
<EOS>
the
well
-
trim
lawn
and
green
meadow
of
home
be
not
there
;
and
the
grass
,
compare
with
our
ornamental
plot
and
pasture
,
be
rank
,
and
rough
,
and
wild
:
 
but
delicate
slope
of
land
,
gently
-
swell
hill
,
wooded
valley
,
and
slender
stream
,
abound
.
 
<EOS>
every
little
colony
of
house
have
its
church
and
school
-
house
peeping
from
among
the
white
roof
and
shady
tree
;
every
house
be
the
white
of
the
white
;
every
Venetian
blind
the
greenest
of
the
green
;
every
fine
day
's
sky
<EOS>
the
blue
of
the
blue
.
 
<EOS>
a
sharp
dry
wind
and
a
slight
frost
have
so
harden
the
road
when
we
alight
at
Worcester
,
that
their
furrowed
track
be
like
ridge
of
granite
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
usual
aspect
of
newness
on
every
object
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
building
look
as
if
they
have
be
build
and
paint
that
morning
,
and
could
be
take
down
on
Monday
with
very
little
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
keen
evening
air
,
every
sharp
outline
look
a
hundred
time
sharp
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
the
clean
cardboard
colonnade
have
no
more
perspective
than
a
chinese
bridge
on
a
tea
-
cup
,
and
appear
equally
well
calculate
for
use
.
 
<EOS>
the
razor
-
like
edge
of
the
detached
cottage
seem
to
cut
the
very
wind
as
it
whistle
against
them
,
and
to
send
it
smart
on
its
way
with
a
shriller
cry
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
those
slightly
-
build
wooden
dwelling
behind
which
the
sun
be
set
with
a
brilliant
lustre
,
could
be
so
look
through
and
through
,
that
the
idea
of
any
inhabitant
be
able
to
hide
himself
from
the
public
gaze
,
or
to
have
any
secret
from
the
public
eye
,
be
not
entertainable
for
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
even
where
a
blaze
fire
shone
through
the
uncurtained
window
of
some
distant
house
,
it
have
the
air
of
be
newly
light
,
and
of
lack
warmth
;
and
instead
of
awaken
thought
of
a
snug
chamber
,
bright
with
face
that
first
see
the
light
round
that
same
hearth
,
and
ruddy
with
warm
hanging
,
it
come
upon
one
suggestive
of
the
smell
of
new
mortar
and
damp
wall
.
   
<EOS>
so
I
think
,
at
least
,
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
next
morning
when
the
sun
be
shine
brightly
,
and
the
clear
church
bell
be
ring
,
and
sedate
people
in
their
good
clothe
enliven
the
pathway
near
at
hand
and
dot
the
distant
thread
of
road
,
there
be
a
pleasant
Sabbath
peacefulness
on
everything
,
which
it
be
good
to
feel
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
the
well
for
an
old
church
;
better
still
for
some
old
grave
;
but
as
it
be
,
a
wholesome
repose
and
tranquillity
pervade
the
scene
,
which
after
the
restless
ocean
and
the
hurried
city
,
have
a
doubly
grateful
influence
on
the
spirit
.
   
<EOS>
We
go
on
next
morning
,
still
by
railroad
,
to
Springfield
.
 
<EOS>
from
that
place
to
Hartford
,
whither
we
be
bind
,
be
a
distance
of
only
five
-
and
-
twenty
mile
,
but
at
that
time
of
the
year
the
road
be
so
bad
that
the
journey
would
probably
have
occupy
ten
or
twelve
hour
.
 
<EOS>
fortunately
,
however
,
the
winter
have
be
unusually
mild
,
the
Connecticut
River
be
"
open
,
"
or
,
in
other
word
,
not
freeze
.
 
<EOS>
the
captain
of
a
small
steamboat
be
go
to
make
his
first
trip
for
the
season
that
day
(
the
second
February
trip
,
I
believe
,
within
the
memory
of
man
)
,
and
only
wait
for
us
to
go
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
we
go
on
board
,
with
as
little
delay
as
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
as
good
as
his
word
,
and
start
directly
.
   
<EOS>
It
certainly
be
not
call
a
small
steamboat
without
reason
.
 
<EOS>
I
omit
to
ask
the
question
,
but
I
should
think
it
must
have
be
of
about
half
a
pony
power
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Paap
,
the
celebrated
Dwarf
,
may
have
live
and
die
happily
in
the
cabin
,
which
be
fit
with
common
sash
-
window
like
an
ordinary
dwelling
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
these
window
have
bright
-
red
curtain
,
too
,
hang
on
slack
string
across
the
low
pane
;
so
that
it
look
like
the
parlour
of
a
lilliputian
public
-
house
,
which
have
get
afloat
in
a
flood
or
some
other
water
accident
,
and
be
drift
nobody
know
where
.
 
<EOS>
but
even
in
this
chamber
there
be
a
rocking
-
chair
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
impossible
to
get
on
anywhere
,
in
America
,
without
a
rocking
-
chair
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
afraid
to
tell
how
many
foot
short
this
vessel
be
,
or
how
many
foot
narrow
:
to
apply
the
word
length
and
width
to
such
measurement
would
be
a
contradiction
in
term
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
may
state
that
we
all
keep
the
middle
of
the
deck
,
lest
the
boat
should
unexpectedly
tip
over
;
and
that
the
machinery
,
by
some
surprising
process
of
condensation
,
work
between
it
and
the
keel
:
 
the
whole
form
a
warm
sandwich
,
about
three
foot
thick
.
   
<EOS>
It
rain
all
day
as
I
once
think
it
never
do
rain
anywhere
,
but
in
the
Highlands
of
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
the
river
be
full
of
float
block
of
ice
,
which
be
constantly
crunch
and
crack
under
us
;
and
the
depth
of
water
,
in
the
course
we
take
to
avoid
the
large
masse
,
carry
down
the
middle
of
the
river
by
the
current
,
do
not
exceed
a
few
inch
.
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
we
move
onward
,
dexterously
;
and
be
well
wrap
up
,
bade
defiance
to
the
weather
,
and
enjoy
the
journey
.
 
<EOS>
the
Connecticut
River
be
a
fine
stream
;
and
the
bank
in
summer
-
time
be
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
beautiful
;
at
all
event
,
I
be
tell
so
by
a
young
lady
in
the
cabin
;
and
she
should
be
a
judge
of
beauty
,
if
the
possession
of
a
quality
include
the
appreciation
of
it
,
for
a
more
beautiful
creature
I
never
look
upon
.
   
<EOS>
after
two
hour
and
a
half
of
this
odd
travelling
(
include
a
stoppage
at
a
small
town
,
where
we
be
salute
by
a
gun
considerably
big
than
our
own
chimney
)
,
we
reach
Hartford
,
and
straightway
repair
to
an
extremely
comfortable
hotel
:
 
except
,
as
usual
,
in
the
article
of
bedroom
,
which
,
in
almost
every
place
we
visit
,
be
very
conducive
to
early
rise
.
   
<EOS>
We
tarry
here
,
four
day
.
 
<EOS>
the
town
be
beautifully
situate
in
a
basin
of
green
hill
;
the
soil
be
rich
,
well
-
wooded
,
and
carefully
improve
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
seat
of
the
local
legislature
of
Connecticut
,
which
sage
body
enact
,
in
bygone
time
,
the
renowned
code
of
"
Blue
Laws
,
"
in
virtue
whereof
,
among
other
enlighten
provision
,
any
citizen
who
could
be
prove
to
have
kiss
his
wife
on
Sunday
,
be
punishable
,
I
believe
,
with
the
stock
.
 
<EOS>
too
much
of
the
old
Puritan
spirit
exist
in
these
part
to
the
present
hour
;
but
its
influence
have
not
tend
,
that
I
know
,
to
make
the
people
less
hard
in
their
bargain
,
or
more
equal
in
their
dealing
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
never
hear
of
its
working
that
effect
anywhere
else
,
I
infer
that
it
never
will
,
here
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
be
accustomed
,
with
reference
to
great
profession
and
severe
face
,
to
judge
of
the
good
of
the
other
world
pretty
much
as
I
judge
of
the
good
of
this
;
and
whenever
I
see
a
dealer
in
such
commodity
with
too
great
a
display
of
them
in
his
window
,
I
doubt
the
quality
of
the
article
within
.
   
<EOS>
in
Hartford
stand
the
famous
oak
in
which
the
charter
of
King
Charles
be
hide
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
now
inclose
in
a
gentleman
's
garden
.
<EOS>
in
the
State
House
be
the
charter
itself
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
the
court
of
law
here
,
just
the
same
as
at
Boston
;
the
public
institution
almost
as
good
.
 
<EOS>
the
Insane
Asylum
be
admirably
conduct
,
and
so
be
the
institution
for
the
Deaf
and
Dumb
.
   
<EOS>
I
very
much
question
within
myself
,
as
I
walk
through
the
Insane
Asylum
,
whether
I
should
have
know
the
attendant
from
the
patient
,
but
for
the
few
word
which
pass
between
the
former
,
and
the
Doctor
,
in
reference
to
the
person
under
their
charge
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
I
limit
this
remark
merely
to
their
look
;
for
the
conversation
of
the
mad
people
be
mad
enough
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
one
little
,
prim
old
lady
,
of
very
smiling
and
good
-
humoured
appearance
,
who
come
sidle
up
to
me
from
the
end
of
a
long
passage
,
and
with
a
curtsey
of
inexpressible
condescension
,
propound
this
unaccountable
inquiry
:
   
"
do
Pontefract
still
flourish
,
sir
,
upon
the
soil
of
England
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
do
,
madam
,
"
I
rejoin
.
   
<EOS>
"
when
you
last
see
him
,
sir
,
he
be
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
well
,
madam
,
"
say
I
,
"
extremely
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
beg
me
to
present
his
compliment
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
him
look
better
.
"
   
<EOS>
at
this
,
the
old
lady
be
very
much
delighted
.
 
<EOS>
after
glance
at
me
for
a
moment
,
as
if
to
be
quite
sure
that
I
be
serious
in
my
respectful
air
,
she
sidle
back
some
pace
;
sidle
forward
again
;
make
a
sudden
skip
(
at
which
I
precipitately
retreat
a
step
or
two
)
;
and
say
:
   
"
I
be
an
antediluvian
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
I
think
the
good
thing
to
say
be
,
that
I
have
suspect
as
much
from
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
I
say
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
be
an
extremely
proud
and
pleasant
thing
,
sir
,
to
be
an
antediluvian
,
"
say
the
old
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
it
be
,
madam
,
"
I
rejoin
.
   
<EOS>
the
old
lady
kiss
her
hand
,
give
another
skip
,
smirk
and
sidle
down
the
gallery
in
a
most
extraordinary
manner
,
and
amble
gracefully
into
her
own
bed
-
chamber
.
   
<EOS>
in
another
part
of
the
building
,
there
be
a
male
patient
in
bed
;
very
much
flushed
and
heat
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
"
say
he
,
start
up
,
and
pull
off
his
night
-
cap
:
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
settle
at
last

<EOS>
I
have
arrange
it
with
Queen
Victoria
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
arrange
what
?
"
ask
the
Doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
that
business
,
"
pass
his
hand
wearily
across
his
forehead
,
"
about
the
siege
of
New

even
while

he
seem

I
think
,
to
have
some
faint
idea

be
incoherent

directly
he
have
say
these
word

he
lie
down
again

give
a

cover
his

after

have
compose

be
very
anxious

walk

I
immediately
do

<EOS>
by

very

humour
him
to
the

I
go
to
the
window
,
which
command
a
beautiful
prospect
,
and
remark
,
with
an
address
upon
which
I
greatly
plume
myself
:
   
"
what
a
delicious
country
you
have
about
these
lodging

yours

"
   
<EOS>
"
Poh
!

say
he
,
move
his
finger
carelessly
over
the
note
of
his
instrument
:
 
"
WELL
ENOUGH
for
SUCH
an
INSTITUTION
as
this

I
do
not

I

take
aback

<EOS>
in

there

there

murder
some

ask

well

they

not

"
   
<EOS>
I
shall
always
entertain
a
very
pleasant
and
grateful
recollection
of
Hartford
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
lovely
place
,
and
I
have
many
friend
there
,
whom
I
can
never
remember
with
indifference
.
 
<EOS>
We
leave
it
with
no
little
regret
on
the
evening
of
Friday
the
11th
,
and
travel
that
night
by
railroad
to
New
Haven
.
 
<EOS>
upon
the
way
,
the
guard
and
I
be
formally
introduce
to
each
other
(
as
we
usually
be
on
such
occasion
)
,
and
exchange
a
variety
of
small
-
talk
.
 
<EOS>
We
reach
New
Haven
at
about
eight
o'clock
,
after
a
journey
of
three
hour
,
and
put
up
for
the
night
at
the
good
inn
.
   
<EOS>
New
Haven
,
know
also
as
the
City
of
Elms
,
be
a
fine
town
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
its
street
(
as
its
ALIAS
sufficiently
import
)
be
plant
with
row
of
grand
old
elm
-
tree
;
and
the
same
natural
ornament
surround
Yale
College
,
an
establishment
of
considerable
eminence
and
reputation
.
 
<EOS>
the
various
department
of
this
institution
be
erect
in
a
kind
of
park
or
common
in
the
middle
of
the
town
,
where
they
be
dimly
visible
among
the
shadow
tree
.
 
<EOS>
the
effect
be
very
like
that
of
an
old
cathedral
yard
in
England
;
and
when
their
branch
be
in
full
leaf
,
must
be
extremely
picturesque
.
<EOS>
even
in
the
winter
time
,
these
group
of
well
-
grow
tree
,
cluster
among
the
busy
street
and
house
of
a
thriving
city
,
have
a
very
quaint
appearance
:
 
seem
to
bring
about
a
kind
of
compromise
between
town
and
country
;
as
if
each
have
meet
the
other
half
-
way
,
and
shake
hand
upon
it
;
which
be
at
once
novel
and
pleasant
.
   
<EOS>
after
a
night
's
rest
,
we
rise
early
,
and
in
good
time
go
down
to
the
wharf
,
and
on
board
the
packet
New
York
for
New
York
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
the
first
american
steamboat
of
any
size
that
I
have
see
;
and
certainly
to
an
english
eye
it
be
infinitely
less
like
a
steamboat
than
a
huge
float
bath
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
persuade
myself
,
indeed
,
but
that
the
bathing
establishment
off
Westminster
Bridge
,
which
I
leave
a
baby
,
have
suddenly
grow
to
an
enormous
size
;
run
away
from
home
;
and
set
up
in
foreign
part
as
a
steamer
.
 
<EOS>
be
in
America
,
too
,
which
our
vagabond
do
so
particularly
favour
<EOS>
,
it
seem
the
more
probable
.
   
<EOS>
the
great
difference
in
appearance
between
these
packet
and
our
,
be
,
that
there
be
so
much
of
them
out
of
the
water
:
 
<EOS>
the
main
-
deck
be
enclose
on
all
side
,
and
fill
with
cask
and
good
,
like
any
second
or
third
floor
in
a
stack
of
warehouse
;
and
the
promenade
or
hurricane
-
deck
be
a
-
top
of
that
again
.
 
<EOS>
a
part
of
the
machinery
be
always
above
this
deck
;
where
the
connecting
-
rod
,
in
a
strong
and
lofty
frame
,
be
see
work
away
like
an
iron
top
-
sawyer
.
<EOS>
there
be
seldom
any
mast
or
tackle
:
 
nothing
aloft
but
two
tall
black
chimney
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
at
the
helm
be
shut
up
in
a
little
house
in
the
fore
part
of
the
boat
(
the
wheel
be
connect
with
the
rudder
by
iron
chain
,
work
the
whole
length
of
the
deck
)
;
and
the
passenger
,
unless
the
weather
be
very
fine
indeed
,
usually
congregate
below
.
 
<EOS>
directly
you
have
leave
the
wharf
,
all
the
life
,
and
stir
,
and
bustle
of
a
packet
cease
.
 
<EOS>
You
wonder
for
a
long
time
how
she
go
on
,
for
there
seem
to
be
nobody
in
charge
of
her
;
and
when
another
of
these
dull
machine
come
splash
by
<EOS>
,
you
feel
quite
indignant
with
it
,
as
a
sullen
cumbrous
,
ungraceful
,
unshiplike
leviathan
:
 
quite
forget
that
the
vessel
you
be
on
board
of
,
be
its
very
counterpart
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
always
a
clerk
's
office
on
the
low
deck
,
where
you
pay
your
fare
;
a
lady
'
cabin
;
baggage
and
stowage
room
;
engineer
's
room
;
and
in
short
a
great
variety
of
perplexity
which
render
the
discovery
of
the
gentleman
's
cabin
,
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
.
<EOS>
It
often
occupy
the
whole
length
of
the
boat
(
as
it
do
in
this
case
)
,
and
have
three
or
four
tier
of
berth
on
each
side
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
first
descend
into
the
cabin
of
the
New
York
,
it
look
,
in
my
unaccustomed
eye
,
about
as
long
as
the
Burlington
Arcade
.
   
<EOS>
the
sound
which
have
to
be
cross
on
this
passage
,
be
not
always
a
very
safe
or
pleasant
navigation
,
and
have
be
the
scene
of
some
unfortunate
accident
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
wet
morning
,
and
very
misty
,
and
we
soon
lose
sight
of
land
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
be
calm
,
however
,
and
brighten
towards
noon
.
 
<EOS>
after
exhaust
(
with
good
help
from
a
friend
)
the
larder
,
and
the
stock
of
bottled
beer
,
I
lie
down
to
sleep
;
be
very
much
tired
with
the
fatigue
of
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
wake
from
my
nap
in
time
to
hurry
up

and
see

Frying

,
and
other
notorious
locality
,
attractive
to
all
reader
of
famous
Diedrich
Knickerbocker
's
history
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
now
in
a
narrow
channel
,
with
slope
bank
on
either
side
,
besprinkle
with
pleasant
villa
,
and
make
refreshing
to
the
sight
by
turf
and
tree
.
 
<EOS>
soon
we
shoot
in
quick
succession
,
past
a
lighthouse
;
 
<EOS>
a
madhouse
(
how
the

up
their

why

this

<EOS>
some

They

<EOS>
not

perhaps
,
that
there
be
more

but
elsewhere

they
have
particular
haunt

you
must
find
them
out

here

they
pervade
the
town
.
   
<EOS>
We
must
cross
Broadway
again
;
gain
some
refreshment
from

<EOS>
be

<EOS>
You
wonder
what
may
be
the
use
of
this
tall

in
the

,
with
something
like
Liberty

so
do
I.

there

<EOS>
again
across

pass
from

coloured

shop

into
another

a

between

on

on

let

look
in

<EOS>
a
small
bare
cell

into
which
the

there
be

upon

sit
a
man

sixty

reading

<EOS>
He
look
up
for
a
moment
;
give
an
impatient
dog
shake
;
and
fix
his
eye
upon
his
book
again
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
withdraw
our
head
,
the
door
close
on
him
,
and
be
fasten
as
before

this
man
have
murder
his

will
probably
be
hang

possible

<EOS>
with
what
stupendous
and
untranslatable
coolness
he
say
this
,
and
how
loungingly
he
lead
on
to
the
woman
's
side
:
 
<EOS>
make
,
as
he
go
,
a
kind

rail

each

square
aperture

some
of
the

peep
anxiously
through
it
at
the
sound
of
footstep
;
other
shrink
away
in
shame
.
<EOS>
---
for
what
offence
can
that
lonely
child
,
of
ten
or
twelve
year
old
,
be
shut
up
here
?
 
<EOS>
oh

<EOS>
that
boy
?
<EOS>
He
be
the
son
of
the
prisoner
we
see
just
now

be
a

be
detain
here
for
safe
keeping

until
the
trial

that
be
all

it
be
a
dreadful
place
for
the
child
to
pass
the
long
day

night
in

<EOS>
this
be
rather
hard
treatment

it
not

<EOS>
what
say

it

again
he
clink
his

leisurely
away

I

a
question
to
ask
him
as
we
go
.
   
<EOS>
"
pray
,
why
do
they
call
this
place
the
Tombs
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
well
,
it
be
the
can
not
name

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
it

<EOS>
why
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
some
suicide

here

when
it

<EOS>
I
expect
it
come
about
from
that

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
just
now
,
that
that
man
's
clothe
be
scatter
about
the
floor
of
his
cell
.
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
oblige
the
prisoner
to
be
orderly
,
and
put
such
thing
away
?

"
   
<EOS>
"
where
should
they
put
'
em
?

"
<EOS>
not
on
the
ground
surely
.
 
<EOS>
what
do
you
say
to
hang
them
up
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
stop
and
look
round
to
emphasise
his
answer
:
   
<EOS>
"
why
,
I
say
that
be
just
it
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
have
hook
they
WOULD
hang
themselves
,
so
they
be
take
out
of
every
cell
,
and
there
be
only
the
mark
leave
where
they
use
to
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
the
prison
-
yard
in
which
he
pause
now
,
have
be
the
scene
of
terrible
performance

<EOS>
into
this
narrow

grave

the

beneath

about

a
weight
at

come
run
down

him
up
into

a

the

dismal

between

the
prison

wall

interpose

thick
gloomy

It
be
the
curtain
to
his

of
death

his
winding

sheet

from
him
it
shut
out
life

unrepente
hardihood
in

which
its

there

let

go
forth
again
into

once

the

We

take

<EOS>
two
portly

up
behind
this

a
select
party
of
half

a

dozen
gentleman

have
just
now
turn
the
corner
.
   
<EOS>
here
be
a
solitary
swine
lounge
homeward
by
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
only
one
ear
;
have
part
with
the
other
to
vagrant
-
dog
in
the
course
of
his
city
ramble

<EOS>
but
he
get
on
very
well
without
it
;
and
lead
a
rove
,
gentlemanly
,
vagabond
kind
of
life
,
somewhat
answer
to
that
of
our
club

man
at
home

<EOS>
He
leave
his
lodging
every
morning
at
a
certain
hour
,
throw
himself
upon
the
town
,
get
through
his
day
in
some
manner
quite
satisfactory
to
himself
,
and
regularly
appear
at
the
door
of
his
own
house
again
at
night
,
like
the
mysterious
master
of
Gil
Blas
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
free
-
and
-
easy
,
careless
,
indifferent
kind
of
pig
,
have
a
very
large
acquaintance
among
other
pig
of
the
same
character
,
whom
he
rather
know
by
sight
than
conversation
,
as
he
seldom
trouble
himself
to
stop
and
exchange
civility
,
but
go
grunt
down
the
kennel
,
turn
up
the
news
and
small
-
talk
of
the
city
in
the
shape
of
cabbage
-
stalk
and
offal
,
and
bear
no
tail
but
his
own
:
 
which
be
a
very
short
one
,
for
his
old
enemy
,
the
dog
,
have
be
at
that
too
,
and
have
leave
him
hardly
enough
to
swear
by
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
in
every
respect
a
republican
pig
,
go
wherever
he
please
,
and
mingle
with
the
good
society
,
on
an
equal
,
if
not
superior
footing
,
for
every
one
make
way
when
he

the
haughtiest
give
him
the
wall
,
if
he
prefer
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
great
philosopher
,
and
seldom
move
,
unless
by
the
dog
before
mention
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
indeed
,
you
may
see
his
small
eye
twinkle
on
a
slaughter
friend
,
whose
carcase
garnish
a
butcher
's
door
-
post
,
but
he
grunt
out
"
<EOS>
such
be
life
:
all
flesh
be
pork
!
"
bury
his
nose
in
the
mire
again
,
and
waddle
down
the
gutter
:
 
comfort
himself
with
the
reflection
that
there
be
one
snout
the
less
to
anticipate
stray
cabbage
-
stalk
,
at
any
rate
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
the
city
scavenger
,
these
pig
.
 
<EOS>
ugly
brute
they
be
;
have
,
for
the
most
part
,
scanty
brown
back
,
like
the
lid
of
old
horsehair
trunk
:
 
spot
with
unwholesome
black
blotch
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
long
,
gaunt
leg
,
too
,
and
such
peaked
snout
,
that
if
one
of
them
could
be
persuade
to
sit
for
his
profile
,
nobody
would
recognise
it
for
a
pig
's
likeness
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
never
attend
upon
,
or
fed
,
or
drive
,
or
catch
,
but
be
throw
upon
their
own
resource
in
early
life
,
and
become
preternaturally
know
in
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
every
pig
know
where
he
live
,
much
well
than
anybody
could
tell
him
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
hour
,
just
as
evening
be
close
in
,
you
will
see
them
roam
towards
bed
by
score
,
eat
their
way
to
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
occasionally
,
some
youth
among
them
who
have
over
-
eat
himself
,
or
have
be
worry
by
dog
,
trot
shrinkingly
homeward
,
like
a
prodigal
son
:
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
a
rare
case
:
 
perfect
self
-
possession
and
self
-
reliance
,
and
immovable
composure
,
be
their
foremost
attribute
.
   
<EOS>
the
street
and
shop
be
light
now
;
and
as
the
eye
travel
down
the
long
thoroughfare
,
dot
with
bright
jet
of
gas
,
it
be
remind
of
Oxford
Street
,
or
piccadilly
.
 
<EOS>
here
and
there
a
flight
of
broad
stone
cellar
-
step
appear
,
and
a
paint
lamp
direct
you
to
the
Bowling
Saloon
,
or
ten

pin
alley
;
ten

pin
be
a
game
of
mingle
chance

,
invent
when
the

pass
an

forbid
Nine

Pins

<EOS>
at
other
downward
flight
of

be
other
lamp
,
mark
the
whereabouts
of
oyster
-
cellar
---
pleasant
retreat
,
say
I
:
 
not
only
by
reason
of
their
wonderful
cookery
of
oyster
,
pretty
nigh
as
large
as
cheese
-
plate
(
or
for
thy
dear
sake
,
heartiest
of
Greek
Professors

,
but
because
of
all
kind
of
cater
of
fish
,
or
flesh
,
or
fowl
,
in
these
latitude
,
the
swallower
of
oyster
alone
be
not
gregarious
;
but
subdue
themselves
,
as
it
be
,
to
the
nature
of
what
they
work
in
,
and
copy
the
coyness
of
the
thing
they
eat
,
do
sit
apart
in
curtained
box
,
and
consort
by
two
,
not
by
two
hundred
.
   
<EOS>
but
how
quiet
the
street
be
!
 
<EOS>
be
there
no
itinerant
band
;
no
wind
or
string
instrument
?
 
<EOS>
no

not
one

<EOS>
by

be
there
no
Punches

Fantoccini

Barrel

<EOS>
no

not

<EOS>
yes
,
I
remember
one
.
 
<EOS>
one
barrel

organ
and
a
dancing

monkey
---
sportive
by
nature
,
but
fast
fade
into
a
dull
,
lumpish
monkey
,
of
the
utilitarian
school
.
 
<EOS>
beyond
that

nothing
lively
;
no

not
so
much
as
a
white

<EOS>
be
there
no
amusement
?
 
<EOS>
yes
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
lecture

room
across
the
way
,
from
which
that
glare
of
light
proceed
,
and
there
may
be
evening
service
for
the
lady
thrice
a
week
,
or
oftener
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
young
gentleman
,
there
be
the
counting

house
,
the
store
,
the
bar
-
room
:
<EOS>
the
latter
,
as
you
may
see
through
these
window
,
pretty
full
.
 
<EOS>
Hark
!
<EOS>
to
the
clinking
sound
of
hammer
break
lump
of
ice
,
and
to
the
cool
gurgling
of
the
pound
bit

as

in
the

they
be
pour
from

<EOS>
no
amusement
?
 
<EOS>
what
be
these
sucker
of
cigar
and
swallower
of
strong
drink
,
whose
hat
and
leg
we
see
in
every
possible
variety
of
twist
,
do
,
but
amuse
themselves
?
 
<EOS>
what
be
the
fifty
newspaper
,
which
those
precocious
urchin
be
bawl
down
the
street
,
and
which
be
keep
file
within
,
what
be
they
but
amusement
?
 
<EOS>
not
vapid
,
waterish
amusement
,
but
good
strong
stuff
;
deal
in
round
abuse
and
blackguard
name
;
pull
off
the
roof
of
private
house
,
as
the
Halting
Devil
do
in
Spain
;
pimping
and
pander
for
all
degree
of
vicious
taste
,
and
gorge
with
coin
lie
the
most
voracious
maw
;
impute
to
every
man
in
public
life
the
coarse
and
the
vile
motive
;
scare
away
from
the
stabbed
and
prostrate
body
-
politic
,
every
Samaritan
of
clear
conscience
and
good
deed
;
and
set
on
,
with
yell
and
whistle
and
the
clapping
of
foul
hand
,
the
vile
vermin
and
bad
bird
of
prey
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
no
amusement
!
   
<EOS>
let
us
go
on
again
;
and
pass
this
wilderness
of
an
hotel
with
store
about
its
base
,
like
some
continental
theatre
,
or
the
London
Opera
House
shorn
of
its
colonnade
,
plunge
into
the
five
point
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
needful
,
first
,
that
we
take
as
our
escort
these
two
head
of
the
police
,
whom
you
would
know
for
sharp
and
well
-
train
officer
if
you
meet
them
in
the
Great
Desert
.
 
<EOS>
so
true
it
be
,
that
certain
pursuit
,
wherever
carry
on
,
will
stamp
man
with
the
same
character
.
 
<EOS>
these
two
may
have
be
begotten
,
bear
,
and
breed
,
in
Bow
Street
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
see
no
beggar
in
the
street
by
night
or
day
;
but
of
other
kind
of
stroller
,
plenty
.
 
<EOS>
poverty
,
wretchedness
,
and
vice
,
be
rife
enough
where
we
be
go
now
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
the
place
:
 
these
narrow
way
,
diverge
to
the
right
and
leave
,
and
reek
everywhere
with
dirt
and
filth
.
 
<EOS>
such
life
as
be
lead
here
,
bear
the
same
fruit
here
as
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
the
coarse
and
bloated
face
at
the
door
,
have
counterpart
at
home
,
and
all
the
wide
world
over
.
 
<EOS>
Debauchery
have
make
the
very
house
prematurely
old
.
 
<EOS>
see
how
the
rotten
beam
be
tumble
down
,
and
how
the
patched
and
broken
window
seem
to
scowl
dimly
,
like
eye
that
have
be
hurt
in
drunken
fray
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
those
pig
live
here
.
 
<EOS>
do
they
ever
wonder
why
their
master
walk
upright
in
lieu
of
go
on
all
-
four
?
<EOS>
and
why
they
talk
instead
of
grunt
?
   
<EOS>
so
far
,
nearly
every
house
be
a
low
tavern
;
and
on
the
bar
-
room
wall
,
be
colour
print
of
Washington
,
and
Queen
Victoria
of
England
,
and
the
American
Eagle
.
 
<EOS>
among
the
pigeon
-
hole
that
hold
the
bottle
,
be
piece
of
plate
-
glass
and
coloured
paper
,
for
there
be
,
in
some
sort
,
a
taste
for
decoration
,
even
here
.
 
<EOS>
and
as
seaman
frequent
these
haunt
,
there
be
maritime
picture
by
the
dozen
:
 
of
parting
between
sailor
and
their
lady
-
love
,
portrait
of
William
,
of
the
ballad
,
and
his
Black
-
Eyed
Susan
;
of
Will
Watch
,
the
Bold
Smuggler
;
of
Paul
Jones
the
Pirate
,
and
the
like
:
 
on
which
the
paint
eye
of
Queen
Victoria
,
and
of
Washington
to
boot
,
rest
in
as
strange
companionship
,
as
on
most
of
the
scene
that
be
enact
in
their
wonder
presence
.
   
<EOS>
what
place
be
this
,
to
which
the
squalid
street
conduct
us
?
 
<EOS>
a
kind
of
square
of
leprous
house
,
some
of
which
be
attainable
only
by
crazy
wooden
stair
without
.
 
<EOS>
what
lie
beyond
this
totter
flight
of
step
,
that
creak
beneath
our
tread
?
<EOS>
---
a
miserable
room
,
light
by
one
dim
candle
,
and
destitute
of
all
comfort
,
save
that
which
may
be
hide
in
a
wretched
bed
.
 
<EOS>
beside
it
,
sit
a
man
:
 
<EOS>
his
elbow
on
his
knee
:
 
his
forehead
hide
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
what
ail
that
man
?
"
ask
the
foremost
officer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fever
,
"
he
sullenly
reply
,
without
look
up
.
 
<EOS>
Conceive
the
fancy
of
a
feverish
brain
,
in
such
a
place
as
this
!
   
<EOS>
ascend
these
pitch
-
dark
stair
,
heedful
of
a
false
footing
on
the
tremble
board
,
and
grope
your
way
with
me
into
this
wolfish
den
,
where
neither
ray
of
light
nor
breath
of
air
,
appear
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
a
negro
lad
,
startle
from
his
sleep
by
the
officer
's
voice
<EOS>
---
he
know
it
well
---
but
comfort
by
his
assurance
that
he
have
not
come
on
business
,
officiously
bestir
himself
to
light
a
candle
.
 
<EOS>
the
match
flicker
for
a
moment
,
and
show
great
mound
of
dusty
rag
upon
the
ground
;
then
die
away
and
leave
a
denser
darkness
than
before
,
if
there
can
be
degree
in
such
extreme
.
 
<EOS>
He
stumble
down
the
stair
and
presently
come
back
,
shade
a
flare
taper
with

<EOS>
do

do

<EOS>
why

such

<EOS>
look

do

<EOS>
do
you

and
wherein
these
human

<EOS>

he
do
not

He
have
have
five

twenty
young

lock
up
in
this
very

and
you

handsome

there
be

'em

<EOS>
in
God

<EOS>
shut
the
door
upon
the
wretched
creature
who
be
in

now

and
put
its
screen
before
a
place
,
quite
unsurpassed
in
all
the
vice

neglect
,
and
devilry
,
of
the
bad
old
town
in
Europe
.
   
<EOS>
be
people
really

all
night

untrie

<EOS>

<EOS>
the

open
his
court
at

<EOS>
that
be
the
early
hour
at
which
the

prisoner
can
be
release
;
and
if
an
officer
appear
against
him
,
he
be
not
take
out
till
nine
o'clock
or
ten

<EOS>
---
<EOS>
but
if
any
one
among

die
in

,
as
one
man
do

not

<EOS>
then
he
be
half

as
that

and
there
an
end
.
   
<EOS>
what
be
this
intolerable
tolling
of
great
bell
,
and
crash
of
wheel
,
and
shout
in
the
distance
?
 
<EOS>
a
fire
.
 
<EOS>
and
what
that
deep
red
light
in
the
opposite

?
 
<EOS>
another
fire

<EOS>
and
what
these
char
and
blacken
wall
<EOS>
we
stand
before
?
 
<EOS>
a
dwelling
where
a
fire
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
more
than
hint
,
in
an
official
report
,
not
long
ago
,
that
some
of
these
conflagration
be
not
wholly
accidental
,
and
that
speculation
and
enterprise
find
a
field
of
exertion
,
even
in
flame
:
 
but
be
this
as
it
may
,
there
be
a
fire
last
night
,
there
be
two
to
-
night
,
and
you
may
lay
an
even
wager
there
will
be
at
least
one
,
to

morrow
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
carry
that
with
us
for
our
comfort
,
let
us
say
,
good
night
,
and
climb
up
-
stair
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
one
day
,
during
my
stay
in
New
York
,
I
pay
a
visit
to
the
different
public
institution
on
Long
Island
,
or
Rhode
Island
:
 
<EOS>
I
forget
which
.
 
<EOS>
one
of
them
be
a
Lunatic
Asylum
.
 
<EOS>
the
building
be
handsome
;
and
be
remarkable
for
a
spacious
and
elegant
staircase
.
<EOS>
the
whole
structure
be
not
yet
finish
,
but
it
be
already
one
of
considerable
size
and
extent
,
and
be
capable
of
accommodate
a
very
large
number
of
patient
.
   
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
I
derive
much
comfort
from
the
inspection
of
this
charity
.
 
<EOS>
the
different
ward
may
have
be
clean
and
better
order
;
I
see
nothing
of
that
salutary
system
which
have
impress
me
so
favourably
elsewhere
;
and
everything
have
a
lounge
,
listless
,
madhouse
air
,
which
be
very
painful
.
 
<EOS>
the
mope
idiot
,
cower
down
with
long
dishevelled
hair
;
the
gibber
maniac
,
with
his
hideous
laugh
and
pointed
finger
;
the
vacant
eye
,
the
fierce
wild
face
,
the
gloomy
picking
of
the
hand
and
lip
,
and
munching
of
the
nail
:
 
there
they
be
all
,
without
disguise
,
in
naked
ugliness
and
horror
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
dining
-
room
,
a
bare
,
dull
,
dreary
place
,
with
nothing
for
the
eye
to
rest
on
but
the
empty
wall
,
a
woman
be
lock
up
alone
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
bent
,
they
tell
me
,
on
commit
suicide
.
 
<EOS>
if
anything
could
have
strengthen
her
in
her
resolution
,
it
would
certainly
have
be
the
insupportable
monotony
of
such
an
existence
.
   
<EOS>
the
terrible
crowd
with
which
these
hall
and
gallery
be
fill
,
so
shock
me
,
that
I
abridge
my
stay
within
the
short
limit
,
and
decline
to
see
that
portion
of
the
building
in
which
the
refractory
and
violent
be
under
close
restraint
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
that
the
gentleman
who
preside
over
this
establishment
at
the
time
I
write
of
,
be
competent
to
manage
it
,
and
have
do
all
in
his
power
to
promote
its
usefulness
:
 
but
will
it
be
believe
that
the
miserable
strife
of
Party
feeling
be
carry
even
into
this
sad
refuge
of
afflicted
and
degraded
humanity
?
 
<EOS>
Will
it
be
believe
that
the
eye
which
be
to
watch
over
and
control
the
wandering
of
mind
on
which
the
most
dreadful
visitation
to
which
our
nature
be
expose
have
fall
,
must
wear
the
glass
of
some
wretched
side
in
politic
?
 
<EOS>
Will
it
be
believe
that
the
governor
of
such
a
house
as
this
,
be
appoint
,
and
depose
,
and
change
perpetually
,
as
party
fluctuate
and
vary
,
and
as
their
despicable
weathercock
be
blow
this
way
or
that
?
 
<EOS>
a
hundred
time
in
every
week
,
some
new
most
paltry
exhibition
of
that
narrow
-
minded
and
injurious
Party
Spirit
,
which
be
the
Simoom
of
America
,
sickening
and
blight
everything
of
wholesome
life
within
its
reach
,
be
force
upon
my
notice
;
but
I
never
turn
my
back
upon
it
with
feeling
of
such
deep
disgust
and
measureless
contempt
,
as
when
I
cross
the
threshold
of
this
madhouse
.
   
<EOS>
at
a
short
distance
from
this
building
be
another
call
the
Alms
House
,
that
be
to
say
,
the
workhouse
of
New
York
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
large
institution
also
:
 
<EOS>
lodging
,
I
believe
,
when
I
be
there
,
nearly
a
thousand
poor
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
badly
ventilate
,
and
badly
light
;
be
not
too
clean
;
---
and
impress
me
,
on
the
whole
,
very
uncomfortably
.
<EOS>
but
it
must
be
remember
that
New
York
,
as
a
great
emporium
of
commerce
,
and
as
a
place
of
general
resort
,
not
only
from
all
part
of
the
States
,
but
from
most
part
of
the
world
,
have
always
a
large
pauper
population
to
provide
for
;
and
labour
,
therefore
,
under
peculiar
difficulty
in
this
respect
.
 
<EOS>
nor
must
it
be
forget
that
New
York
be
a
large
town
,
and
that
in
all
large
town
a
vast
amount
of
good
and
evil
be
intermix
and
jumble
up
together
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
same
neighbourhood
be
the
Farm
,
where
young
orphan
be
nurse
and
breed
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
it
,
but
I
believe
it
be
well
conduct
;
and
I
can
the
more
easily
credit
it
,
from
know
how
mindful
they
usually
be
,
in
America
,
of
that
beautiful
passage
in
the
Litany
which
remember
all
sick
person
and
young
child
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
take
to
these
institution
by
water
,
in
a
boat
belong
to
the
Island
jail
,
and
row
by
a
crew
of
prisoner
,
who
be
dress
in
a
striped
uniform
of
black
and
buff
,
in
which
they
look
like
fade
tiger
.
 
<EOS>
They
take
me
,
by
the
same
conveyance
,
to
the
jail
itself
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
an
old
prison
,
and
quite
a
pioneer
establishment
,
on
the
plan
I
have
already
describe
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
hear
this
,
for
it
be
unquestionably
a
very
indifferent
one
.
 
<EOS>
the
most
be
make
,
however
,
of
the
mean
it
possess
,
and
it
be
as
well
regulate
as
such
a
place
can
be
.
   
<EOS>
the
woman
work
in
covered
shed
,
erect
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
remember
right
,
there
be
no
shop
for
the
man
,
but
be
that
as
it
may
,
the
great
part
of
them
labour
in
certain
stone
-
quarry
near
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
be
very
wet
indeed
,
this
labour
be

,
and
the
prisoner
be
in
their
cell
.
 
<EOS>
imagine
these
cell
,
some
two
or
three
hundred
in
number
,
and
in
every
one
a
man
lock
up
;
this
one
at
his
door
for
air
,
with
his
hand
thrust
through
the
grate
;
this
one
in
bed
(
in
the
middle
of
the
day
,
remember
)
;
and
this
one
fling
down
in
a
heap
upon
the
ground
,
with
his
head
against
the
bar
,
like
a
wild
beast
.
 
<EOS>
make
the
rain
pour
down
,
outside
,
in
torrent

<EOS>
put
the
everlasting
stove
in
the
midst
;
hot
,
and
suffocate
,
and
vaporous
,
as
a
witch
's
cauldron
.
 
<EOS>
add
a
collection
of
gentle
odour
,
such
as
would
arise
from
a
thousand
mildew
umbrella
,
wet
through
,
and
a
thousand
buck
-
basket
,
full
of
half
-
washed
linen
---
and
there
be
the
prison
,
as
it
be
that
day
.
   
<EOS>
the
prison
for
the
state
at
Sing
Sing
be
,
on
the
other
hand
,
a
model
jail
.
 
<EOS>
that
,
and
Auburn
,
be
,
I
believe
,
the
large
and
good
example
of
the
silent
system
.
   
<EOS>
in
another
part
of
the
city
,
be
the
Refuge
for
the
Destitute
:
 
an
Institution
whose
object
be
to
reclaim
youthful
offender
,
male
and
female
,
black
and
white
,
without
distinction
;
to
teach
them
useful
trade
,
apprentice
them
to
respectable
master
,
and
make
them
worthy
member
of
society
.
 
<EOS>
Its
design
,
it
will
be
see
,
be
similar
to
that
at
Boston
;
and
it
be
a
no
less
meritorious
and
admirable
establishment
.
 
<EOS>
a
suspicion
cross
my
mind
during
my
inspection
of
this
noble
charity
,
whether
the
superintendent
have
quite
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
world
and
worldly
character
;
and
whether
he
do
not
commit
a
great
mistake
in
treat
some
young
girl
,
who
be
to
all
intent
and
purpose
,
by
their
year
and
their
past
life
,
woman
,
as
though
they
be
little
child
;
which
certainly
have
a
ludicrous
effect
in
my
eye
,
and
,
or
I
be
much
mistaken
,
in
theirs
also
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
Institution
,
however
,
be
always
under
a
vigilant
examination
of
a
body
of
gentleman
of
great
intelligence
and
experience
,
it
can
not
fail
to
be
well
conduct
;
and
whether
I
be
right
or
wrong
in
this
slight
particular
,
be
unimportant
to
its
desert
and
character
,
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
estimate
too
highly
.
   
<EOS>
in
addition
to
these
establishment
,
there
be
in
New
York
,
excellent
hospital
and
school
,
literary
institution
and
library
;
an
admirable
fire
department
(
as
indeed
it
should
be
,
have
constant
practice
)
,
and
charity
of
every
sort
and
kind
.
<EOS>
in
the
suburb
there
be
a
spacious
cemetery
:
 
unfinished
yet
,
but
every
day
improve
.
 
<EOS>
the
sad
tomb
I
see
there
be
"
the
Strangers
'
Grave
.
 
<EOS>
dedicate
to
the
different
hotel
in
this
city
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
there
be
three
principal
theatre
.
 
<EOS>
two
of
them
,
the
Park
and
the
Bowery
,
be
large
,
elegant
,
and
handsome
building
,
and
be
,
I
grieve
to
write
it
,
generally
desert
.
 
<EOS>
the
third
,
the
Olympic
,
be
a
tiny
show
-
box
for
vaudeville
and
burlesque
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
singularly
well
conduct
by
Mr
Mitchell
,
a
comic
actor
of
great
quiet
humour
and
originality
,
who
be
well
remember
and
esteem
by
London
playgoer
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
happy
to
report
of
this
deserve
gentleman
,
that
his
bench
be
usually
well
fill
,
and
that
his
theatre
ring
with
merriment
every
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
almost
forget
a
small
summer
theatre
,
call
Niblo
's
,
with
gardens
and
open
air
amusement
attach
;
but
I
believe
it
be
not
exempt
from
the
general
depression
under
which
Theatrical
Property
,
or
what
be
humorously
call
by
that
name
,
unfortunately
labour
.
   
<EOS>
the
country
round
New
York
be
surpassingly
and
exquisitely
picturesque
.
 
<EOS>
the
climate
,
as
I
have
already
intimate
,
be
somewhat
of
the
warm
.
 
<EOS>
what
it
would
be
,
without
the
sea
breeze
which
come
from
its
beautiful
Bay
in
the
evening
time
,
I
will
not
throw
myself
or
my
reader
into
a
fever
by
inquire
.
   
<EOS>
the
tone
of
the
good
society
in
this
city
,
be
like
that
of
Boston
;
here
and
there
,
it
may
be
,
with
a
great
infusion
of
the
mercantile
spirit
,
but
generally
polished
and
refined
,
and
always
most
hospitable
.
 
<EOS>
the
house
and
table
be
elegant
;
the
hour
later
and
more
rakish
;
and
there
be
,
perhaps
,
a
great
spirit
of
contention
in
reference
to
appearance
,
and
the
display
of
wealth
and
costly
living
.
 
<EOS>
the
lady
be
singularly
beautiful
.
   
<EOS>
before
I
leave
New
York
I
make
arrangement
for
secure
a
passage
home
in
the
George
Washington
packet
ship
,
which
be
advertise
to
sail
in
June
:
 
<EOS>
that
be
the
month
in
which
I
have
determine
,
if
prevent
by
no
accident
in
the
course
of
my
rambling
,
to
leave
America
.
   
<EOS>
I
never
think
that
go
back
to
England
,
return
to
all
who
be
dear
to
me
,
and
to
pursuit
that
have
insensibly
grow
to
be
a
part
of
my
nature
,
I
could
have
feel
so
much
sorrow
as
I
endure
,
when
I
part
at
last
,
on
board
this
ship
,
with
the
friend
who
have
accompany
me
from
this
city
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
think
the
name
of
any
place
,
so
far
away
and
so
lately
know
,
could
ever
associate
itself
in
my
mind
with
the
crowd
of
affectionate
remembrance
that
now
cluster
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
those
in
this
city
who
would
brighten
,
to
me
,
the
dark
winter
-
day
that
ever
glimmer
and
go
out
in
Lapland
;
and
before
whose
presence
even
Home
grow
dim
,
when
they
and
I
exchange
that
painful
word
which
mingle
with
our
every
thought
and
deed
;
which
haunt
our
cradle
-
head
in
infancy
,
and
close
up
the
vista
of
our
life
in

Chapter

<EOS>
Philadelphia
,
and
Its
Solitary
Prison
 
<EOS>
the
journey
from
New
York
to
Philadelphia
,
be
make
by
railroad
,
and
two
ferry
;
and
usually
occupy
between
five
and
six
hour
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
evening
when
we
be
passenger
in
the
train
:
 
and
watch
the
bright
sunset
from
a
little
window
near
the
door
by
which
we
sit
,
my
attention
be
attract
to
a
remarkable
appearance
issue
from
the
window
of
the
gentleman
's
car
immediately
in
front
of
us
,
which
I
suppose
for
some
time
be
occasion
by
a
number
of
industrious
person
inside
,
rip
open
feather
-
bed
,
and
give
the
feather
to
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
it
occur
to
me
that
they
be
only
spit
,
which
be
indeed
the
case
;
though
how
any
number
of
passenger
which
it
be
possible
for
that
car
to
contain
,
could
have
maintain
such
a
playful
and
incessant
shower
of
expectoration
,
I
be
still
at
a
loss
to
understand
:
notwithstanding
the
experience
in
all
salivatory
phenomenon
which
I
afterwards
acquire
.
   
<EOS>
I
make
acquaintance
,
on
this
journey
,
with
a
mild
and
modest
young
quaker
,
who
open
the
discourse
by
inform
me
,
in
a
grave
whisper
,
that
his
grandfather
be
the
inventor
of
cold
-
draw
castor
oil
.
 
<EOS>
I
mention
the
circumstance
here
,
think
it
probable
that
this
be
the
first
occasion
on
which
the
valuable
medicine
in
question
be
ever
use
as
a
conversational
aperient
.
   
<EOS>
We
reach
the
city
,
late
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
look
out
of
my
chamber
-
window
,
before
go
to
bed
,
I
see
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
,
a
handsome
building
of
white
marble
,
which
have
a
mournful
ghost
-
like
aspect
,
dreary
to
behold
.
 
<EOS>
I
attribute
this
to
the
sombre
influence
of
the
night
,
and
on
rise
in
the
morning
look
out
again
,
expect
to
see
its
step
and
portico
throng
with
group
of
people
pass
in
and
out
.
 
<EOS>
the
door
be
still
tight
shut
,
however
;
the
same
cold
cheerless
air
prevail
:
 
and
the
building
look
as
if
the
marble
statue
of
Don
Guzman
could
alone
have
any
business
to
transact
within
its
gloomy
wall
.
 
<EOS>
I
hasten
to
inquire
its
name
and
purpose
,
and
then
my
surprise
vanish
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
Tomb
of
many
fortune
;
the
Great
Catacomb
of
investment
;
the
memorable
United
States
Bank
.
   
<EOS>
the
stoppage
of
this
bank
,
with
all
its
ruinous
consequence
,
have
cast
(
as
I
be
tell
on
every
side
)
a
gloom
on
Philadelphia
,
under
the
depressing
effect
of
which
it
yet
labour
.
 
<EOS>
It
certainly
do
seem
rather
dull
and
out
of
spirit
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
handsome
city
,
but
distractingly
regular
.
 
<EOS>
after
walk
about
it
for
an
hour
or
two
,
I
feel
that
I
would
have
give
the
world
for
a
crooked
street
.
 
<EOS>
the
collar
of
my
coat
appear
to
stiffen
,
and
the
brim
of
my
bat
to
expand
,
beneath
its
quakery
influence
.
 
<EOS>
My
hair
shrink
into
a
sleek
short
crop
,
my
hand
fold
themselves
upon
my
breast
of
their
own
calm
accord
,
and
thought
of
take
lodging
in
Mark
Lane
over
against
the
Market
Place
,
and
of
make
a
large
fortune
by
speculation
in
corn
,
come
over
me
involuntarily
.
   
<EOS>
Philadelphia
be
most
bountifully
provide
with
fresh
water
,
which
be
shower
and
jerk
about
,
and
turn
on
,
and
pour
off
,
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
the
Waterworks
,
which
be
on
a
height
near
the
city
,
be
no
less
ornamental
than
useful
,
be
tastefully
lay
out
as
a
public
garden
,
and
keep
in
the
good
and
neatest
order
.
 
<EOS>
the
river
be
dam
at
this
point
,
and
force
by
its
own
power
into
certain
high
tank
or
reservoir
,
whence
the
whole
city
,
to
the
top
story
of
the
house
,
be
supply
at
a
very
trifling
expense
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
various
public
institution
.
 
<EOS>
among
them
a
most
excellent
hospital
---
a
quaker
establishment
,
but
not
sectarian
in
the
great
benefit
it
confer
;
a
quiet
,
quaint
old
Library
,
name
after
Franklin
;
a
handsome
Exchange
and
Post
Office
;
and
so
forth
.
 
<EOS>
in
connection
with
the
quaker
Hospital
,
there
be
a
picture
by
West
,
which
be
exhibit
for
the
benefit
of
the
fund
of
the
institution
.
<EOS>
the
subject
be
,
our
Saviour
healing
the
sick
,
and
it
be
,
perhaps
,
as
favourable
a
speciman
of
the
master
as
can
be
see
anywhere
.
<EOS>
whether
this
be
high
or
low
praise
,
depend
upon
the
reader
's
taste
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
same
room
,
there
be
a
very
characteristic
and
life
-
like
portrait
by
Mr
Sully
,
a
distinguished
american
artist
.
   
<EOS>
My
stay
in
Philadelphia
be
very
short
,
but
what
I
see
of
its
society
,
I
greatly
like
.
 
<EOS>
treating
of
its
general
characteristic
,
I
should
be
dispose
to
say
that
it
be
more
provincial
than
Boston
or
New
York
,
and
that
there
be
afloat
in
the
fair
city
,
an
assumption
of
taste
and
criticism
,
savour
rather
of
those
genteel
discussion
upon
the
same
theme
,
in
connection
with
Shakspeare
and
the
Musical
Glasses
,
of
which
we
read
in
the
Vicar
of
Wakefield
.
 
<EOS>
near
the
city
,
be
a
most
splendid
unfinished
marble
structure
for
the
Girard
College
,
found
by
a
deceased
gentleman
of
that
name
and
of
enormous
wealth
,
which
,
if
complete
accord
to
the
original
design
,
will
be
perhaps
the
rich
edifice
of
modern
time
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
bequest
be
involve
in
legal
dispute
,
and
pende
them
the
work
have
stop
;
so
that
like
many
other
great
undertaking
in
America
,
even
this
be
rather
go
to
be
do
one
of
these
day
,
than
do
now
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
outskirt
,
stand
a
great
prison
,
call
the
Eastern
Penitentiary
:
 
conduct
on
a
plan
peculiar
to
the
state
of
Pennsylvania
.
 
<EOS>
the
system
here
,
be
rigid
,
strict
,
and
hopeless
solitary
confinement
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
it
,
in
its
effect
,
to
be
cruel
and
wrong
.
   
<EOS>
in
its
intention
,
I
be
well
convinced
that
it
be
kind
,
humane
,
and
mean
for
reformation
;
but
I
be
persuade
that
those
who
devise
this
system
of
Prison
Discipline
,
and
those
benevolent
gentleman
who
carry
it
into
execution
,
do
not
know
what
it
be
that
they
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
that
very
few
man
be
capable
of
estimate
the
immense
amount
of
torture
and
agony
which
this
dreadful
punishment
,
prolong
for
year
,
inflict
upon
the
sufferer
;
and
in
guess
at
it
myself
,
and
in
reasoning
from
what
I
have
see
write
upon
their
face
,
and
what
to
my
certain
knowledge
they
feel
within
,
I
be
only
the
more
convinced
that
there
be
a
depth
of
terrible
endurance
in
it
which
none
but
the
sufferer
themselves
can
fathom
,
and
which
no
man
have
a
right
to
inflict
upon
his
fellow
-
creature
.
<EOS>
I
hold
this
slow
and
daily
tamper
with
the
mystery
of
the
brain
,
to
be
immeasurably
bad
than
any
torture
of
the
body
:
 
and
because
its
ghastly
sign
and
token
be
not
so
palpable
to
the
eye
and
sense
of
touch
as
scar
upon
the
flesh
;
because
its
wound
be
not
upon
the
surface
,
and
it
extort
few
cry
that
human
ear
can
hear
;
therefore
I
the
more
denounce
it
,
as
a
secret
punishment
which
slumber
humanity
be
not
rouse
up
to
stay
.
 
<EOS>
I
hesitate
once
,
debate
with
myself
,
whether
,
if
I
have
the
power
of
say
"
yes
"
or
"
no
,
"
I
would
allow
it
to
be
try
in
certain
case
,
where
the
term
of
imprisonment
be
short
;
but
now
,
I
solemnly
declare
,
that
with
no
reward
or
honour
could
I
walk
a
happy
man
beneath
the
open
sky
by
day
,
or
lie
me
down
upon
my
bed
at
night
,
with
the
consciousness
that
one
human
creature
,
for
any
length
of
time
,
no
matter
what
,
lie
suffer
this
unknown
punishment
in
his
silent
cell
,
and
I
the
cause
,
or
I
consent
to
it
in
the
least
degree
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
accompany
to
this
prison
by
two
gentleman
officially
connect
with
its
management
,
and
pass
the
day
in
go
from
cell
to
cell
,
and
talk
with
the
inmate
.
 
<EOS>
every
facility
be
afford
me
,
that
the
utmost
courtesy
could
suggest
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
be
conceal
or
hide
from
my
view
,
and
every
piece
of
information
that
I
seek
,
be
openly
and
frankly
give
.
 
<EOS>
the
perfect
order
of
the
building
can
not
be
praise
too
highly
,
and
of
the
excellent
motive
of
all
who
be
immediately
concerned
in
the
administration
of
the
system
,
there
can
be
no
kind
of
question
.
   
<EOS>
between
the
body
of
the
prison
and
the
outer
wall
,
there
be
a
spacious
garden
.
 
<EOS>
enter
it
,
by
a
wicket
in
the
massive
gate
,
we
pursue
the
path
before
us
to
its
other
termination
,
and
pass
into
a
large
chamber
,
from
which
seven
long
passage
radiate
.
 
<EOS>
on
either
side
of
each
,
be
a
long
,
long
row
of
low
cell
door
,
with
a
certain
number
over
every
one
.
 
<EOS>
above
,
a
gallery
of
cell
like
those
below
,
except
that
they
have
no
narrow
yard
attach
(
as
those
in
the
ground
tier
have
)
,
and
be
somewhat
small
.
 
<EOS>
the
possession
of
two
of
these
,
be
suppose
to
compensate
for
the
absence
of
so
much
air
and
exercise
as
can
be
have
in
the
dull
strip
attach
to
each
of
the
other
,
in
an
hour
's
time
every
day
;
and
therefore
every
prisoner
in
this
upper
story
have
two
cell
,
adjoin
and
communicate
with
,
each
other
.
   
<EOS>
stand
at
the
central
point
,
and
look
down
these
dreary
passage
,
the
dull
repose
and
quiet
that
prevail
,
be
awful
.
<EOS>
occasionally
,
there
be
a
drowsy
sound
from
some
lone
weaver
's
shuttle
,
or
shoemaker
's
last
,
but
it
be
stifle
by
the
thick
wall
and
heavy
dungeon
-
door
,
and
only
serve
to
make
the
general
stillness
more
profound
.
 
<EOS>
over
the
head
and
face
of
every
prisoner
who
come
into
this
melancholy
house
,
a
black
hood
be
draw
;
and
in
this
dark
shroud
,
an
emblem
of
the
curtain
drop
between
him
and
the
live
world
,
he
be
lead
to
the
cell
from
which
he
never
again
come
forth
,
until
his
whole
term
of
imprisonment
have
expire
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
hear
of
wife
and
child
;
home
or
friend
;
the
life
or
death
of
any
single
creature
.
 
<EOS>
He
see
the
prison
-
officer
,
but
with
that
exception
he
never
look
upon
a
human
countenance
,
or
hear
a
human
voice
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
bury
alive
;
to
be
dig
out
in
the
slow
round
of
year
;
and
in
the
mean
time
dead
to
everything
but
torture
anxiety
and
horrible
despair
.
   
<EOS>
His
name
,
and
crime
,
and
term
of
suffering
,
be
unknown
,
even
to
the
officer
who
deliver
him
his
daily
food
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
number
over
his
cell
-
door
,
and
in
a
book
of
which
the
governor
of
the
prison
have
one
copy
,
and
the
moral
instructor
another
:
 
this
be
the
index
of
his
history
.
 
<EOS>
beyond
these
page
the
prison
have
no
record
of
his
existence
:
 
and
though
he
live
to
be
in
the
same
cell
ten
weary
year
,
he
have
no
means
of
know
,
down
to
the
very
last
hour
,
in
which
part
of
the
building
it
be
situate
;
what
kind
of
man
there
be
about
him
;
whether
in
the
long
winter
night
there
be
live
people
near
,
or
he
be
in
some
lonely
corner
of
the
great
jail
,
with
wall
,
and
passage
,
and
iron
door
between
him
and
the
near
sharer
in
its
solitary
horror
.
   
<EOS>
every
cell
have
double
door
:
 
the
outer
one
of
sturdy
oak
,
the
other
of
grate
iron
,
wherein
there
be
a
trap
through
which
his
food
be
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
Bible
,
and
a
slate
and
pencil
,
and
,
under
certain
restriction
,
have
sometimes
other
book
,
provide
for
the
purpose
,
and
pen
and
ink
and
paper
.
 
<EOS>
His
razor
,
plate
,
and
can
,
and
basin
,
hang
upon
the
wall
,
or
shine
upon
the
little
shelf
.
 
<EOS>
fresh
water
be
lay
on
in
every
cell
,
and
he
can
draw
it
at
his
pleasure
.
<EOS>
during
the
day
,
his
bedstead
turn
up
against
the
wall
,
and
leave
more
space
for
him
to
work
in
.
 
<EOS>
His
loom
,
or
bench
,
or
wheel
,
be
there
;
and
there
he
labour
,
sleep
and
wake
,
and
count
the
season
as
they
change
,
and
grow
old
.
   
<EOS>
the
first
man
I
see
,
be
seat
at
his
loom
,
at
work
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
there
six
year
,
and
be
to
remain
,
I
think
,
three
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
convict
as
a
receiver
of
steal
good
,
but
even
after
his
long
imprisonment
,
deny
his
guilt
,
and
say
he
have
be
hardly
deal
by
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
his
second
offence
.
   
<EOS>
He
stop
his
work
when
we
go
in
,
take
off
his
spectacle
,
and
answer
freely
to
everything
that
be
say
to
him
,
but
always
with
a
strange
kind
of
pause
first
,
and
in
a
low
,
thoughtful
voice
.
 
<EOS>
He
wear
a
paper
hat
of
his
own
making
,
and
be
pleased
to
have
it
notice
and
command
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
very
ingeniously
manufacture
a
sort
of
dutch
clock
from
some
disregard
odd
and
end
;
and
his
vinegar
-
bottle
serve
for
the
pendulum
.
 
<EOS>
see
me
interested
in
this
contrivance
,
he
look
up
at
it
with
a
great
deal
of
pride
,
and
say
that
he
have
be
think
of
improve
it
,
and
that
he
hope
the
hammer
and
a
little
piece
of
break
glass
beside
it
"
would
play
music
before
long
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
have
extract
some
colour
from
the
yarn
with
which
he
work
,
and
paint
a
few
poor
figure
on
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
one
,
of
a
female
,
over
the
door
<EOS>
,
he
call
"
the
Lady
of
the
Lake
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
smile
as
I
look
at
these
contrivance
to
while
away
the
time
;
but
when
I
look
from
them
to
him
,
I
see
that
his
lip
tremble
,
and
could
have
count
the
beating
of
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
forget
how
it
come
about
,
but
some
allusion
be
make
to
his
have
a
wife
.
 
<EOS>
He
shake
his
head
at
the
word
,
turn
aside
,
and
cover
his
face
with
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
but
you
be
resign
now
!
"
say
one
of
the
gentleman
after
a
short
pause
,
during
which
he
have
resume
his
former
manner
.
 
<EOS>
He
answer
with
a
sigh
that
seem
quite
reckless
in
its
hopelessness
,
"
<EOS>
oh
yes
,
<EOS>
oh
yes
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
resign
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
be
a
well
man
,
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
hope
so
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
hope
I
may
be
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
time
go
pretty
quickly
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Time
be
very
long
gentleman
,
within
these
four
wall
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
gaze
about
him
---
<EOS>
Heaven
only
know
how
wearily
!
<EOS>
---
as
he
say
these
word
;
and
in
the
act
of
do
so
,
fall
into
a
strange
stare
as
if
he
have
forget
something
.
 
<EOS>
a
moment
afterwards
he
sigh
heavily
,
put
on
his
spectacle
,
and
go
about
his
work
again
.
   
<EOS>
in
another
cell
,
there
be
a
German
,
sentence
to
five
year
'
imprisonment
for
larceny
,
two
of
which
have
just
expire
.
 
<EOS>
with
colour
procure
in
the
same
manner
,
he
have
paint
every
inch
of
the
wall
and
ceiling
quite
beautifully
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
lay
out
the
few
foot
of
ground
,
behind
,
with
exquisite
neatness
,
and
have
make
a
little
bed
in
the
centre
,
that
look
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
like
a
grave
.
<EOS>
the
taste
and
ingenuity
he
have
display
in
everything
be
most
extraordinary
;
and
yet
a
more
dejected
,
heart
-
break
,
wretched
creature
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
such
a
picture
of
forlorn
affliction
and
distress
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
My
heart
bleed
for
him
;
and
when
the
tear
run
down
his
cheek
,
and
he
take
one
of
the
visitor
aside
,
to
ask
,
with
his
tremble
hand
nervously
clutch
at
his
coat
to
detain
him
,
whether
there
be
no
hope
of
his
dismal
sentence
be
commute
,
the
spectacle
be
really
too
painful
to
witness
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
see
or
hear
of
any
kind
of
misery
that
impress
me
more
than
the
wretchedness
of
this
man
.
   
<EOS>
in
a
third
cell
,
be
a
tall
,
strong
black
,
a
burglar
,
work
at
his
proper
trade
of
make
screw
and
the
like
.
 
<EOS>
His
time
be
nearly
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
only
a
very
dexterous
thief
,
but
be
notorious
for
his
boldness
and
hardihood
,
and
for
the
number
of
his
previous
conviction
.
 
<EOS>
He
entertain
us
with
a
long
account
of
his
achievement
,
which
he
narrate
with
such
infinite
relish
,
that
he
actually
seem
to
lick
his
lip
as
he
tell
us
racy
anecdote
of
steal
plate
,
and
of
old
lady
whom
he
have
watch
as
they
sit
at
window
in
silver
spectacle
(
he
have
plainly
have
an
eye
to
their
metal
even
from
the
other
side
of
the
street
)
and
have
afterwards
rob
.
 
<EOS>
this
fellow
,
upon
the
slight
encouragement
,
would
have
mingle
with
his
professional
recollection
the
most
detestable
can
not
;
but
I
be
very
much
mistaken
if
he
could
have
surpass
the
unmitigated
hypocrisy
with
which
he
declare
that
he
bless
the
day
on
which
he
come
into
that
prison
,
and
that
he
never
would
commit
another
robbery
as
long
as
he
live
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
one
man
who
be
allow
,
as
an
indulgence
,
to
keep
rabbit
.
 
<EOS>
His
room
have
rather
a
close
smell
in
consequence
<EOS>
,
they
call
to
him
at
the
door
to
come
out
into
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
He
comply
of
course
,
and
stand
shade
his
haggard
face
in
the
unwonted
sunlight
of
the
great
window
,
look
as
wan
and
unearthly
as
if
he
have
be
summon
from
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
white
rabbit
in
his
breast
;
and
when
the
little
creature
,
get
down
upon
the
ground
,
steal
back
into
the
cell
,
and
he
,
be
dismiss
,
creep
timidly
after
it
<EOS>
,
I
think
it
would
have
be
very
hard
to
say
in
what
respect
the
man
be
the
noble
animal
of
the
two
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
an
english
thief
,
who
have
be
there
but
a
few
day
out
of
seven
year
:
 
a
villainous
,
low
-
browed
,
thin
-
lip
fellow
,
with
a
white
face
;
who
have
as
yet
no
relish
for
visitor
,
and
who
,
but
for
the
additional
penalty
,
would
have
gladly
stab
me
with
his
shoemaker
's
knife
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
another
German
who
have
enter
the
jail
but
yesterday
,
and
who
start
from
his
bed
when
we
look
in
,
and
plead
,
in
his
broken
English
,
very
hard
for
work
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
poet
,
who
after
do
two
day
'
work
in
every
four
-
and
-
twenty
hour
,
one
for
himself
and
one
for
the
prison
,
write
verse
about
ship
(
he
be
by
trade
a
mariner
)
,
and
"
the
maddening
wine
-
cup
,
"
and
his
friend
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
very
many
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
some
redden
at
the
sight
of
visitor
,
and
some
turn
very
pale
.
 
<EOS>
some
two
or
three
have
prisoner
nurse
with
them
,
for
they
be
very
sick
;
and
one
,
a
fat
old
negro
whose
leg
have
be
take
off
within
the
jail
,
have
for
his
attendant
a
classical
scholar
and
an
accomplished
surgeon
,
himself
a
prisoner
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
sit
upon
the
stair
,
engage
in
some
slight
work
,
be
a
pretty
coloured
boy
.
<EOS>
"
be
there
no
refuge
for
young
criminal
in
Philadelphia
,
then
?
"
say
I.
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
but
only
for
white
child
.
"
 
noble
aristocracy
in
crime
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
sailor
who
have
be
there
upward
of
eleven
year
,
and
who
in
a
few
month
'
time
would
be
free
.
 
<EOS>
eleven
year
of
solitary
confinement
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
glad
to
hear
your
time
be
nearly
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
what
do
he
say
?
 
<EOS>
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
why
do
he
stare
at
his
hand
,
and
pick
the
flesh
upon
his
finger
,
and
raise
his
eye
for
an
instant
,
every
now
and
then
,
to
those
bare
wall
which
have
see
his
head
turn
grey
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
way
he
have
sometimes
.
   
<EOS>
do
he
never
look
man
in
the
face
,
and
do
he
always
pluck
at
those
hand
of
his
,
as
though
he
be
bent
on
part
skin
and
bone
?
 
<EOS>
It
be
his
humour
:
 
nothing
more
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
his
humour
too
,
to
say
that
he
do
not
look
forward
to
go
out
;
that
he
be
not
glad
the
time
be
draw
near
;
that
he
do
look
forward
to
it
once
,
but
that
be
very
long
ago
;
that
he
have
lose
all
care
for
everything
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
his
humour
to
be
a
helpless
,
crush
,
and
broken
man
.
 
<EOS>
and
,
Heaven
be
his
witness
that
he
have
his
humour
thoroughly
gratify
!
   
<EOS>
there
be
three
young
woman
in
adjoin
cell
,
all
convict
at
the
same
time
of
a
conspiracy
to
rob
their
prosecutor
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
silence
and
solitude
of
their
life
they
have
grow
to
be
quite
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
Their
look
be
very
sad
,
and
may
have
move
the
stern
visitor
to
tear
,
but
not
to
that
kind
of
sorrow
which
the
contemplation
of
the
man
awaken
.
 
<EOS>
one
be
a
young
girl
;
not
twenty
,
as
I
recollect
;
whose
snow
-
white
room
be
hang
with
the
work
of
some
former
prisoner
,
and
upon
whose
downcast
face
the
sun
in
all
its
splendour
shone
down
through
the
high
chink
in
the
wall
,
where
one
narrow
strip
of
bright
blue
sky
be
visible
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
very
penitent
and
quiet
;
have
come
to
be
resign
,
she
say
(
and
I
believe
her
)
;
and
have
a
mind
at
peace
.
 
<EOS>
"
in
a
word
,
you
be
happy
here
?
"
say
one
of
my
companion
.
 
<EOS>
She
struggle
---
<EOS>
she
do
struggle
very
hard
---
to
answer
,
yes
;
but
raise
her
eye
,
and
meet
that
glimpse
of
freedom
overhead
<EOS>
,
she
burst
into
tear
,
and
say
,
"
She
try
to
be
;
she
utter
no
complaint
;
but
it
be
natural
that
she
should
sometimes
long
to
go
out
of
that
one
cell
:
 
she
could
not
help
that
,
"
she
sob
,
poor
thing
!
   
<EOS>
I
go
from
cell
to
cell
that
day
;
and
every
face
I
see
,
or
word
I
hear
,
or
incident
<EOS>
I
note
,
be
present
to
my
mind
in
all
its
painfulness
.
 
<EOS>
but
let
me
pass
them
by
,
for
one
,
more
pleasant
,
glance
of
a
prison
on
the
same
plan
which
I
afterwards
see
at
Pittsburg
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
have
go
over
that
,
in
the
same
manner
,
I
ask
the
governor
if
he
have
any
person
in
his
charge
who
be
shortly
go
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
one
<EOS>
,
he
say
,
whose
time
be
up
next
day
;
but
he
have
only
be
a
prisoner
two
year
.
   
<EOS>
two
year
!
 
<EOS>
I
look
back
through
two
year
of
my
own
life
---
out
of
jail
,
prosperous
,
happy
,
<EOS>
surround
by
blessing
,
comfort
,
good
fortune
---
and
think
how
wide
a
gap
it
be
,
and
how
long
those
two
year
pass
in
solitary
captivity
would
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
the
face
of
this
man
,
who
be
go
to
be
release
next
day
,
before
me
now
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
almost
more
memorable
in
its
happiness
than
the
other
face
in
their
misery
.
 
<EOS>
how
easy
and
how
natural
it
be
for
him
to
say
that
the
system
be
a
good
one
;
and
that
the
time
go
"
pretty
quick
---
consider
;
"
and
that
when
a
man
once
feel
that
he
have
offend
the
law
,
and
must
satisfy
it
,
"
he
get
along
,
somehow
:
"
and
so
forth
!
   
<EOS>
"
what
do
he
call
you
back
to
say
to
you
,
in
that
strange
flutter
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
of
my
conductor
,
when
he
have
lock
the
door
and
join
me
in
the
passage
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
 
<EOS>
that
he
be
afraid
the
sol
of
his
boot
be
not
fit
for
walk
,
as
they
be
a
good
deal
wear
when
he
come
in
;
and
that
he
would
thank
me
very
much
to
have
them
mend
,
ready
.
"
   
<EOS>
those
boot
have
be
take
off
his
foot
,
and
put
away
with
the
rest
of
his
clothe
,
two
year
before
!
   
<EOS>
I
take
that
opportunity
of
inquire
how
they
conduct
themselves
immediately
before
go
out
;
add
that
I
presume
they
tremble
very
much
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
it
be
not
so
much
a
tremble
,
"
be
the
answer
---
"
though
they
do
quiver
---
as
a
complete
derangement
of
the
nervous
system
.
 
<EOS>
They
can
not
sign
their
name
to
the
book
;
sometimes
can
not
even
hold
the
pen
;
look
about
'em
without
appear
to
know
why
,
or
where
they
be
;
and
sometimes
get
up
and
sit
down
again
,
twenty
time
in
a
minute
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
when
they
be
in
the
office
,
where
they
be
take
with
the
hood
on
,
as
they
be
bring
in
.
 
<EOS>
when
they
get
outside
the
gate
,
they
stop
,
and
look
first
one
way
<EOS>
and
then
the
other
;
not
know
which
to
take
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
they
stagger
as
if
they
be
drunk
,
and
sometimes
be
force
to
lean
against
the
fence
<EOS>
,
they
be
so
bad
:
<EOS>
---
but
they
clear
off
in
course
of
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
as
I
walk
among
these
solitary
cell
,
and
look
at
the
face
of
the
man
within
them
,
I
try
to
picture
to
myself
the
thought
and
feeling
natural
to
their
condition
.
 
<EOS>
I
imagine
the
hood
just
take
off
,
and
the
scene
of
their
captivity
disclose
to
them
in
all
its
dismal
monotony
.
   
<EOS>
at
first
,
the
man
be
stunned
.
 
<EOS>
His
confinement
be
a
hideous
vision
;
and
his
old
life
a
reality
.
 
<EOS>
He
throw
himself
upon
his
bed
,
and
lie
there
abandon
to
despair
.
 
<EOS>
by
degree
the
insupportable
solitude
and
barrenness
of
the
place
rouse
him
from
this
stupor
,
and
when
the
trap
in
his
grate
door
be
open
,
he
humbly
beg
and
pray
for
work
.
 
<EOS>
"
give
me
some
work
to
do
,
or
I
shall
go
rave
mad
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
have
it
;
and
by
fit
and
start
apply
himself
to
labour
;
but
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
there
come
upon
him
a
burning
sense
of
the
year
that
must
be
waste
in
that
stone
coffin
,
and
an
agony
so
pierce
in
the
recollection
of
those
who
be
hide
from
his
view
and
knowledge
<EOS>
,
that
he
start
from
his
seat
,
and
stride
up
and
down
the
narrow
room
with
both
hand
clasped
on
his
uplifted
head
,
hear
spirit
tempt
him
to
beat
his
brain
out
on
the
wall
.
   
<EOS>
again
he
fall
upon
his
bed
,
and
lie
there
,
moan
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
he
start
up
,
wonder
whether
any
other
man
be
near
;
whether
there
be
another
cell
like
that
on
either
side
of
him
:
 
and
listen
keenly
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
no
sound
,
but
other
prisoner
may
be
near
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
He
remember
to
have
hear
once
,
when
he
little
thought
of
come
here
himself
,
that
the
cell
be
so
construct
that
the
prisoner
could
not
hear
each
other
,
though
the
officer
could
hear
them
.
   
<EOS>
where
be
the
near
man
---
upon
the
right
,
or
on
the
left
?
<EOS>
or
be
there
one
in
both
direction
?
 
<EOS>
where
be
he
sit
now
---
with
his
face
to
the
light
?
<EOS>
or
be
he
walk
to
and
fro
?
 
<EOS>
how
be
he
dress
?
<EOS>
have
he
be
here
long
?
 
<EOS>
be
he
much
wear
away
?
 
<EOS>
be
he
very
white
and
spectre
-
like
?
 
<EOS>
do
he
think
of
his
neighbour
too
?
   
<EOS>
scarcely
venture
to
breathe
,
and
listen
<EOS>
while
he
think
,
he
conjure
up
a
figure
with
his
back
towards
him
,
and
imagine
it
move
about
in
this
next
cell
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
idea
of
the
face
,
but
he
be
certain
of
the
dark
form
of
a
stooping
man
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
cell
upon
the
other
side
,
he
put
another
figure
,
whose
face
be
hide
from
him
also
.
 
<EOS>
Day
after
day
,
and
often
when
he
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
he
think
of
these
two
man
until
he
be
almost
distract
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
change
them
.
 
<EOS>
there
they
be
always
as
he
first
imagine
them
---
an
old
man
on
the
right
;
a
young
man
upon
the
left
---
whose
hide
feature
torture
him
to
death
,
and
have
a
mystery
that
make
him
tremble
.
   
<EOS>
the
weary
day
pass
on
with
solemn
pace
,
like
mourner
at
a
funeral
;
and
slowly
he
begin
to
feel
that
the
white
wall
of
the
cell
have
something
dreadful
in
them
:
 
that
their
colour
be
horrible
:
 
that
their
smooth
surface
chill
his
blood
:
 
that
there
be
one
hateful
corner
which
torment
him
.
 
<EOS>
every
morning
when
he
wake
,
he
hide
his
head
beneath
the
coverlet
,
and
shudder
to
see
the
ghastly
ceiling
look
down
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
blessed
light
of
day
itself
peep
in
,
an
ugly
phantom
face
,
through
the
unchangeable
crevice
which
be
his
prison
window
.
   
<EOS>
by
slow
but
sure
degree
,
the
terror
of
that
hateful
corner
swell
until
they
beset
him
at
all
time
;
invade
his
rest
,
make
his
dream
hideous
,
and
his
night
dreadful
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
,
he
take
a
strange
dislike
to
it
;
feel
as
though
it
give
birth
in
his
brain
to
something
of
correspond
shape
,
which
ought
not
to
be
there
,
and
rack
his
head
with
pain
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
begin
to
fear
it
,
then
to
dream
of
it
,
and
of
man
whisper
its
name
and
point
to
it
.
<EOS>
then
he
could
not
bear
to
look
at
it
,
nor
yet
to
turn
his
back
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
it
be
every
night
<EOS>
the
lurk
-
place
of
a
ghost
:
 
a
shadow
:
---
a
silent
something
,
horrible
to
see
,
but
whether
bird
,
or
beast
,
or
muffle
human
shape
,
he
can
not
tell
.
   
<EOS>
when
he
be
in
his
cell
by
day
,
he
fear
the
little
yard
without
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
in
the
yard
,
he
dread
to
re
-
enter
the
cell
.
 
<EOS>
when
night
come
,
there
stand
the
phantom
in
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
the
courage
to
stand
in
its
place
,
and
drive
it
out
<EOS>
(
he
have
once
:
be
desperate
)
<EOS>
,
it
brood
upon
his
bed
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
twilight
,
and
always
at
the
same
hour
,
a
voice
call
to
him
by
name
;
as
the
darkness
thicken
,
his
Loom
begin
to
live
;
and
even
that
,
his
comfort
,
be
a
hideous
figure
,
watch
him
till
daybreak
.
   
<EOS>
again
,
by
slow
degree
,
these
horrible
fancy
depart
from
him
one
by
one
:
 
<EOS>
return
sometimes
,
unexpectedly
,
but
at
long
interval
,
and
in
less
alarming
shape
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
talk
upon
religious
matter
with
the
gentleman
who
visit
him
,
and
have
read
his
Bible
,
and
have
write
a
prayer
upon
his
slate
,
and
hang
it
up
as
a
kind
of
protection
,
and
an
assurance
of
heavenly
companionship
.
 
<EOS>
He
dream
now
,
sometimes
,
of
his
child
or
his
wife
,
but
be
sure
that
they
be
dead
,
or
have
desert
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
easily
move
to
tear
;
be
gentle
,
submissive
,
and
break
-
spirited
.
<EOS>
occasionally
,
the
old
agony
come
back
:
 
<EOS>
a
very
little
thing
will
revive
it
;
even
a
familiar
sound
,
or
the
scent
of
summer
flower
in
the
air
;
but
it
do
not
last
long
,
now
:
 
for
the
world
without
,
have
come
to
be
the
vision
,
and
this
solitary
life
,
the
sad
reality
.
   
<EOS>
if
his
term
of
imprisonment
be
short
---
I
mean
comparatively
,
for
short
it
can
not
be
---
<EOS>
the
last
half
year
be
almost
bad
than
all
;
for
then
he
think
the
prison
will
take
fire
and
he
be
burn
in
the
ruin
,
or
that
he
be
doom
to
die
within
the
wall
,
or
that
he
will
be
detain
on
some
false
charge
and
sentence
for
another
term
:
 
or
that
something
,
no
matter
what
,
must
happen
to
prevent
his
go
at
large
.
 
<EOS>
and
this
be
natural
,
and
impossible
to
be
reason
against
,
because
,
after
his
long
separation
from
human
life
,
and
his
great
suffering
,
any
event
will
appear
to
him
more
probable
in
the
contemplation
,
than
the
be
restore
to
liberty
and
his
fellow
-
creature
.
   
<EOS>
if
his
period
of
confinement
have
be
very
long
,
the
prospect
of
release
bewilder
and
confuse
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
broken
heart
may
flutter
for
a
moment
,
when
he
think
of
the
world
outside
,
and
what
it
may
have
be
to
him
in
all
those
lonely
year
,
but
that
be
all
.
<EOS>
the
cell
-
door
have
be
close
too
long
on
all
its
hope
and
care
.
<EOS>
well
to
have
hang
him
in
the
beginning
than
bring
him
to
this
pass
,
and
send
him
forth
to
mingle
with
his
kind
,
who
be
his
kind
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
on
the
haggard
face
of
every
man
among
these
prisoner
,
the
same
expression
sit
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
liken
it
to
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
something
of
that
strained
attention
which
we
see
upon
the
face
of
the
blind
and
deaf
,
mingle
with
a
kind
of
horror
,
as
though
they
have
all
be
secretly
terrify
.
 
<EOS>
in
every
little
chamber
that
I
enter
,
and
at
every
grate
through
which
I
look
,
I
seem
to
see
the
same
appalling
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
It
live
in
my
memory
,
with
the
fascination
of
a
remarkable
picture
.
 
<EOS>
Parade
before
my
eye
,
a
hundred
man
,
with
one
among
them
newly
release
from
this
solitary
suffering
,
and
I
would
point
him
out
.
   
<EOS>
the
face
of
the
woman
,
as
I
have
say
,
it
humanise
and
refine
.
<EOS>
whether
this
be
because
of
their
well
nature
,
which
be
elicit
in
solitude
,
or
because
of
their
be
gentle
creature
,
of
great
patience
and
longer
suffer
,
I
do
not
know
;
but
so
it
be
.
<EOS>
that
the
punishment
be
nevertheless
,
to
my
thinking
,
fully
as
cruel
and
as
wrong
in
their
case
,
as
in
that
of
the
man
,
I
need
scarcely
add
.
   
<EOS>
My
firm
conviction
be
that
,
independent
of
the
mental
anguish
<EOS>
it
occasion
---
an
anguish
so
acute
and
so
tremendous
,
that
all
imagination
of
it
must
fall
far
short
of
the
reality
<EOS>
---
it
wear
the
mind
into
a
morbid
state
,
which
render
it
unfit
for
the
rough
contact
and
busy
action
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
my
fix
opinion
that
those
who
have
undergo
this
punishment
,
MUST
pass
into
society
again
morally
unhealthy
and
disease
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
many
instance
on
record
,
of
man
who
have
choose
,
or
have
be
condemn
,
to
life
of
perfect
solitude
,
but
I
scarcely
remember
one
,
even
among
sage
of
strong
and
vigorous
intellect
,
where
its
effect
have
not
become
apparent
,
in
some
disorder
train
of
thought
,
or
some
gloomy
hallucination
.
 
<EOS>
what
monstrous
phantom
,
breed
of
despondency
and
doubt
,
and
bear
and
rear
in
solitude
,
have
stalk
upon
the
earth
,
make
creation
ugly
,
and
darken
the
face
of
Heaven
!
   
<EOS>
suicide
be
rare
among
these
prisoner
:
 
be
almost
,
indeed
,
unknown
.
 
<EOS>
but
no
argument
in
favour
of
the
system
,
can
reasonably
be
deduce
from
this
circumstance
,
although
it
be
very
often
urge
.
<EOS>
all
man
who
have
make
disease
of
the
mind
their
study
,
know
perfectly
well
that
such
extreme
depression
and
despair
as
will
change
the
whole
character
,
and
beat
down
all
its
power
of
elasticity
and
self
-
resistance
,
may
be
at
work
within
a
man
,
and
yet
stop
short
of
self
-
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
common
case
.
   
<EOS>
that
it
make
the
sense
dull
,
and
by
degree
impair
the
bodily
faculty
,
I
be
quite
sure
.
 
<EOS>
I
remark
to
those
who
be
with
me
in
this
very
establishment
at
Philadelphia
,
that
the
criminal
who
have
be
there
long
,
be
deaf
.
 
<EOS>
They
,
who
be
in
the
habit
of
see
these
man
constantly
,
be
perfectly
amazed
at
the
idea
,
which
they
regard
as
groundless
and
fanciful
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
the
very
first
prisoner
to
whom
they
appeal
---
one
of
their
own
selection
confirm
my
impression
(
which
be
unknown
to
him
)
instantly
,
and
say
,
with
a
genuine
air
it
be
impossible
to
doubt
,
that
he
could
not
think
how
it
happen
,
but
he
be
grow
very
dull
of
hearing
.
   
<EOS>
that
it
be
a
singularly
unequal
punishment
,
and
affect
the
bad
man
<EOS>
least
,
there
be
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
in
its
superior
efficiency
as
a
means
of
reformation
,
compare
with
that
other
code
of
regulation
which
allow
the
prisoner
to
work
in
company
without
communicate
together
,
I
have
not
the
small
faith
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
instance
of
reformation
that
be
mention
to
me
,
be
of
a
kind
that
may
have
be
---
and
I
have
no
doubt
whatever
,
in
my
own
mind
,
would
have
be
---
equally
well
bring
about
by
the
Silent
System
.
 
<EOS>
with
regard
to
such
man
as
the
negro
burglar
and
the
english
thief
,
even
the
most
enthusiastic
have
scarcely
any
hope
of
their
conversion
.
   
<EOS>
It
seem
to
me
that
the
objection
that
nothing
wholesome
or
good
have
ever
have
its
growth
in
such
unnatural
solitude
,
and
that
even
a
dog
or
any
of
the
more
intelligent
among
beast
,
would
pine
,
and
mope
,
and
rust
away
,
beneath
its
influence
,
would
be
in
itself
a
sufficient
argument
against
this
system
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
we
recollect
,
in
addition
,
how
very
cruel
and
severe
it
be
,
and
that
a
solitary
life
be
always
liable
to
peculiar
and
distinct
objection
of
a
most
deplorable
nature
,
which
have
arise
here
,
and
call
to
mind
,
moreover
,
that
the
choice
be
not
between
this
system
,
and
a
bad
or
ill
-
consider
one
,
but
between
it
and
another
which
have
work
well
,
and
be
,
in
its
whole
design
and
practice
,
excellent
;
there
be
surely
more
than
sufficient
reason
for
abandon
a
mode
of
punishment
attend
by
so
little
hope
or
promise
,
and
fraught
,
beyond
dispute
,
with
such
a
host
of
evil
.
   
<EOS>
as
a
relief
to
its
contemplation
,
I
will
close
this
chapter
with
a
curious
story
arise
out
of
the
same
theme
,
which
be
relate
to
me
,
on
the
occasion
of
this
visit
,
by
some
of
the
gentleman
concern
.
   
<EOS>
at
one
of
the
periodical
meeting
of
the
inspector
of
this
prison
,
a
work
man
of
Philadelphia
present
himself
before
the
Board
,
and
earnestly
request
to
be
place
in
solitary
confinement
.
 
<EOS>
on
be
ask
what
motive
could
possibly
prompt
him
to
make
this
strange
demand
,
he
answer
that
he
have
an
irresistible
propensity
to
get
drunk
;
that
he
be
constantly
indulge
it
,
to
his
great
misery
and
ruin
;
that
he
have
no
power
of
resistance
;
that
he
wish
to
be
put
beyond
the
reach
of
temptation
;
and
that
he
could
think
of
no
well
way
than
this
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
point
out
to
him
,
in
reply
,
that
the
prison
be
for
criminal
who
have
be
try
and
sentence
by
the
law
,
and
could
not
be
make
available
for
any
such
fanciful
purpose
;
he
be
exhort
to
abstain
from
intoxicate
drink
,
as
he
surely
may
if
he
would
;
and
receive
other
very
good
advice
,
with
which
he
retire
,
exceedingly
dissatisfied
with
the
result
of
his
application
.
   
<EOS>
He
come
again
,
and
again
,
and
again
,
and
be
so
very
earnest
and
importunate
,
that
at
last
they
take
counsel
together
,
and
say
,
"
He
will
certainly
qualify
himself
for
admission
,
if
we
reject
him
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
shut
him
up
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
soon
be
glad
to
go
away
,
and
then
we
shall
get
rid
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
they
make
him
sign
a
statement
which
would
prevent
his
ever
sustain
an
action
for
false
imprisonment
,
to
the
effect
that
his
incarceration
be
voluntary
,
and
of
his
own
seeking
;
they
request
him
to
take
notice
that
the
officer
in
attendance
have
order
to
release
him
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
,
when
he
may
knock
upon
his
door
for
that
purpose
;
but
desire
him
to
understand
,
that
once
go
out
,
he
would
not
be
admit
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
these
condition
agree
upon
,
and
he
still
remain
in
the
same
mind
,
he
be
conduct
to
the
prison
,
and
shut
up
in
one
of
the
cell
.
   
<EOS>
in
this
cell
,
the
man
,
who
have
not
the
firmness
to
leave
a
glass
of
liquor
standing
untaste
on
a
table
before
him
---
in
this
cell
,
in
solitary
confinement
,
and
work
every
day
at
his
trade
of
shoemaking
,
this
man
remain
nearly
two
year
.
 
<EOS>
His
health
beginning
to
fail
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
,
the
surgeon
recommend
that
he
should
work
occasionally
in
the
garden
;
and
as
he
like
the
notion
very
much
,
he
go
about
this
new
occupation
with
great
cheerfulness
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
dig
here
,
one
summer
day
,
very
industriously
,
when
the
wicket
in
the
outer
gate
chance
to
be
leave
open
:
 
showing
,
beyond
,
the
well
-
remember
dusty
road
and
sunburnt
field
.
 
<EOS>
the
way
be
as
free
to
him
as
to
any
man
live
,
but
he
no
sooner
raise
his
head
and
catch
sight
of
it
,
all
shine
in
the
light
,
than
,
with
the
involuntary
instinct
of
a
prisoner
,
he
cast
away
his
spade
,
scamper
off
as
fast
as
his
leg
would
carry
him
,
and
never
once
look
back

Chapter
08
.
<EOS>
Washington
.
 
<EOS>
the
Legislature
.
 
<EOS>
and
the
President
's
House
 
we
leave
Philadelphia
by
steamboat
,
at
six
o'clock
one
very
cold
morning
,
and
turn
our
face
towards
Washington
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
this
day
's
journey
,
as
on
subsequent
occasion
,
we
encounter
some
englishman
(
small
farmer
,
perhaps
,
or
country
publican
at
home
)
who
be
settle
in
America
,
and
be
travel
on
their
own
affair
.
 
<EOS>
of
all
grade
and
kind
of
man
that
jostle
one
in
the
public
conveyance
of
the
States
,
these
be
often
the
most
intolerable
and
the
most
insufferable
companion
.
 
<EOS>
United
to
every
disagreeable
characteristic
that
the
bad
kind
of
american
traveller
possess
,
these
countryman
of
our
display
an
amount
of
insolent
conceit
and
cool
assumption
of
superiority
,
quite
monstrous
to
behold
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
coarse
familiarity
of
their
approach
,
and
the
effrontery
of
their
inquisitiveness
(
which
they
be
in
great
haste
to
assert
,
as
if
they
pant
to
revenge
themselves
upon
the
decent
old
restraint
of
home
)
,
they
surpass
any
native
specimen
that
come
within
my
range
of
observation
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
often
grow
so
patriotic
when
I
see
and
hear
them
,
that
I
would
cheerfully
have
submit
to
a
reasonable
fine
,
if
I
could
have
give
any
other
country
in
the
whole
world
,
the
honour
of
claim
them
for
its
child
.
   
<EOS>
as
Washington
may
be
call
the
head
-
quarter
of
tobacco
-
tincture
saliva
,
the
time
be
come
when
I
must
confess
,
without
any
disguise
,
that
the
prevalence
of
those
two
odious
practice
of
chewing
and
expectorating
begin
about
this
time
to
be
anything
but
agreeable
,
and
soon
become
most
offensive
and
sickening
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
the
public
place
of
America
,
this
filthy
custom
be
recognise
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
court
of
law
,
the
judge
have
his
spittoon
,
the
cri
his
,
the
witness
his
,
and
the
prisoner
his
;
while
the
juryman
and
spectator
be
provide
for
,
as
so
many
man
who
in
the
course
of
nature
must
desire
to
spit
incessantly
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
hospital
,
the
student
of
medicine
be
request
,
by
notice
upon
the
wall
,
to
eject
their
tobacco
juice
into
the
box
provide
for
that
purpose
,
and
not
to
discolour
the
stair
.
 
<EOS>
in
public
building
,
visitor
be
implore
,
through
the
same
agency
,
to
squirt
the
essence
of
their
quid
,
or
"
plug
,
"
as
I
have
hear
them
call
by
gentleman
learn
in
this
kind
of
sweetmeat
,
into
the
national
spittoon
,
and
not
about
the
basis
of
the
marble
column
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
some
part
,
this
custom
be
inseparably
mix
up
with
every
meal
and
morning
call
,
and
with
all
the
transaction
of
social
life
.
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
,
who
follow
in
the
track
I
take
myself
,
will
find
it
in
its
full
bloom
and
glory
,
luxuriant
in
all
its
alarm
recklessness
,
at
Washington
.
 
<EOS>
and
let
him
not
persuade
himself
(
as
I
once
do
,
to
my
shame
)
that
previous
tourist
have
exaggerate
its
extent
.
 
<EOS>
the
thing
itself
be
an
exaggeration
of
nastiness
,
which
can
not
be
outdo
.
   
<EOS>
on
board
<EOS>
this
steamboat
,
there
be
two
young
gentleman
,
with
shirt
-
collar
reverse
as
usual
,
and
arm
with
very
big
walking
-
stick
;
who
plant
two
seat
in
the
middle
of
the
deck
,
at
a
distance
of
some
four
pace
apart
;
take
out
their
tobacco
-
box
;
and
sit
down
opposite
each
other
,
to
chew
.
 
<EOS>
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
's
time
,
these
hopeful
youth
have
shed
about
them
on
the
clean
board
,
a
copious
shower
of
yellow
rain
;
clearing
,
by
that
means
,
a
kind
of
magic
circle
,
within
whose
limit
no
intruder
dare
to
come
,
and
which
they
never
fail
to
refresh
and
re
-
refresh
before
a
spot
be
dry
.
 
<EOS>
this
being
before
breakfast
,
rather
dispose
me
,
I
confess
,
to
nausea
;
but
look
attentively
at
one
of
the
expectorator
,
I
plainly
see
that
he
be
young
in
chewing
,
and
feel
inwardly
uneasy
,
himself
.
 
<EOS>
a
glow
of
delight
come
over
me
at
this
discovery
;
and
as
I
mark
his
face
turn
paler
and
paler
,
and
see
the
ball
of
tobacco
in
his
left
cheek
,
quiver
with
his
suppressed
agony
,
while
yet
he
spit
,
and
chew
,
and
spat
again
,
in
emulation
of
his
old
friend
,
I
could
have
fall
on
his
neck
and
implore
him
to
go
on
for
hour
.
   
<EOS>
We
all
sit
down
to
a
comfortable
breakfast
in
the
cabin
below
,
where
there
be
no
more
hurry
or
confusion
than
at
such
a
meal
in
England
,
and
where
there
be
certainly
great
politeness
exhibit
than
at
most
of
our
stage
-
coach
banquet
.
 
<EOS>
at
about
nine
o'clock
we
arrive
at
the
railroad
station
,
and
go
on
by
the
car
.
 
<EOS>
at
noon
we
turn
out
again
,
to
cross
a
wide
river
in
another
steamboat
;
land
at
a
continuation
of
the
railroad
on
the
opposite
shore
;
and
go
on
by
other
car
;
in
which
,
in
the
course
of
the
next
hour
or
so
,
we
cross
by
wooden
bridge
,
each
a
mile
in
length
,
two
creek
,
call
respectively
great
and
Little
Gunpowder
.
 
<EOS>
the
water
in
both
be
blacken
with
flight
of
canvas
-
back
duck
,
which
be
most
delicious
eating
,
and
abound
hereabout
at
that
season
of
the
year
.
   
<EOS>
these
bridge
be
of
wood
,
have
no
parapet
,
and
be
only
just
wide
enough
for
the
passage
of
the
train
;
which
,
in
the
event
of
the
small
accident
,
wound
inevitably
be
plunge
into
the
river
.
<EOS>
They
be
startle
contrivance
,
and
be
most
agreeable
when
pass
.
   
<EOS>
We
stop
to
dine
at
Baltimore
,
and
be
now
in
Maryland
,
be
wait
on
,
for
the
first
time
,
by
slave
.
 
<EOS>
the
sensation
of
exact
any
service
from
human
creature
who
be
buy
and
sell
,
and
be
,
for
the
time
,
a
party
as
it
be
to
their
condition
,
be
not
an
enviable
one
.
 
<EOS>
the
institution
exist
,
perhaps
,
in
its
least
repulsive
and
most
mitigate
form
in
such
a
town
as
this
;
but
it
be
slavery
;
and
though
I
be
,
with
respect
to
it
,
an
innocent
man
,
its
presence
fill
me
with
a
sense
of
shame
and
self
-
reproach
.
   
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
we
go
down
to
the
railroad
again
,
and
take
our
seat
in
the
car
for
Washington
.
 
<EOS>
be
rather
early
,
those
man
and
boy
who
happen
to
have
nothing
particular
to
do
,
and
be
curious
in
foreigner
,
come
(
accord
to
custom
)
<EOS>
round
the
carriage
in
which
I
sit
;
let
down
all
the
window
;
thrust
in
their
head
and
shoulder
;
hook
themselves
on
conveniently
,
by
their
elbow
;
and
fall
to
compare
note
on
the
subject
of
my
personal
appearance
,
with
as
much
indifference
as
if
I
be
a
stuff
figure
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
gain
so
much
uncompromising
information
with
reference
to
my
own
nose
and
eye
,
and
various
impression
work
by
my
mouth
and
chin
on
different
mind
,
and
how
my
head
look
when
it
be
view
from
behind
,
as
on
these
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
some
gentleman
be
only
satisfied
by
exercise
their
sense
of
touch
;
and
the
boy
(
who
be
surprisingly
precocious
in
America
)
be
seldom
satisfied
,
even
by
that
,
but
would
return
to
the
charge
over
and
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
many
a
bud
president
have
walk
into
my
room
with
his
cap
on
his
head
and
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
and
stare
at
me
for
two
whole
hour
:
 
occasionally
refresh
himself
with
a
tweak
of
his
nose
,
or
a
draught
from
the
water
-
jug
;
or
by
walk
to
the
window
and
invite
other
boy
in
the
street
below
,
to
come
up

do
likewise

crying

"

<EOS>
We
reach
Washington
at
about
half
-
past
six
that
evening
,
and
have
upon
the
way
a
beautiful
view
of
the
Capitol
,
which
be
a
fine
building
of
the
corinthian
order
,
place
upon
a
noble
and
commanding
eminence
.
 
<EOS>
arrive
at
the
hotel
;
I
see
no
more
of
the
place
that
night
;
be
very
tired
,
and
glad
to
get
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
breakfast
over
next
morning

I
walk
about
the
street
for
an
hour
or
two
,
and
,
come
home

throw
up
the
window
in
the
front

back
,
and
look
out
.
 
<EOS>
here
be
Washington
,
fresh
in
my
mind
and
under
my
eye
.
   
<EOS>
take
the
bad
part
of
the
City
Road
and
Pentonville
,
or
the
straggle
outskirt
of
Paris
,
where
the
house
be
small
,
preserve
all
their
oddity
,
but
especially
the
small
shop

<EOS>

Post
Office

one
the
Patent
Office

and
one
the
Treasury

make
it
scorch
hot
in
the
morning
,
and
freeze
cold
in
the
afternoon
,
with
an
occasional
tornado
of
wind
and
dust
;
leave
a
brick
-
field
without
the
brick
,
in
all
central
place
where
a
street
may
naturally
be
expect

and
that
be
Washington

<EOS>
the
hotel
in
which
we
live

be
a
long
row
of
small
house

and
opening
at
the
back
upon

<EOS>
I
walk
to
the

look
across
the
road
upon
a
long

straggle
row
of
house
,
one
story
high
,
terminate
,
nearly
opposite
,
but
a
little
to
the
left
,
in
a
melancholy
piece
of
waste
ground
with
frowzy
grass
,
which
look
like
a
small
piece
of
country
that
have
take
to
drinking
,
and
have
quite
lose
itself
.
 
<EOS>
stand
anyhow
and
all
wrong

upon
this
open
space
,
like
something
meteoric
that
have
fall
down
from
the
moon
,
be
an
odd
,
lop
-
sided
,
one

eyed
kind
of
wooden
building

that
look

with
a

staff
as
long
as
itself

out

<EOS>
something
large

<EOS>
under

the

most
obtrusive

<EOS>
on

a

be

"
the

"
 
<EOS>
at
another

which
look
like
a
backway
to
somewhere
else

but
be
an
independent
building
in
itself
,
oyster
be
procurable

<EOS>
at

pant

or
in

pantaloon

<EOS>
and
that
be
our
street
in
Washington
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
sometimes
call
the
City
of
Magnificent
Distances
,
but
it
may
with
great
propriety
be
term
the
City
of
Magnificent
Intentions
;
for
it
be
only
on
take
a
bird's
-
eye
view
of
it
from
the
top
of
the
Capitol
,
that
one
can
at
all
comprehend
the
vast
design
of
its
projector
,
an
aspire
Frenchman
.
 
<EOS>
spacious
avenue
,
that
begin
in
nothing
,
and
lead
nowhere
;
street
,
mile
-
long
,
that
only
want
house
,
road
and
inhabitant
;
public
building
that
need
but
a
public
to
be
complete
;
and
ornament
of
great
thoroughfare
,
which
only
lack
great
thoroughfare
to
ornament
---
be
its
lead
feature
.
 
<EOS>
one
may
fancy
the
season
over
,
and
most
of
the
house
go
out
of
town
for
ever
with
their
master
.
 
<EOS>
to
the
admirer
of
city
it
be
a
Barmecide
Feast
:
 
a
pleasant
field
for
the
imagination
to
rove
in
;
a
monument
raise
to
a
deceased
project
,
with
not
even
a
legible
inscription
to
record
its
depart
greatness
.
   
<EOS>
such
as
it
be
,
it
be
likely
to
remain
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
originally
choose
for
the
seat
of
Government
,
as
a
means
of
avert
the
conflict
jealousy
and
interest
of
the
different
States
;
and
very
probably
,
too
,
as
be
remote
from
mob
:
 
<EOS>
a
consideration
not
to
be
slight
,
even
in
America
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
no
trade
or
commerce
of
its
own
:
 
<EOS>
have
little
or
no
population
beyond
the
President
and
his
establishment
;
the
member
of
the
legislature
who
reside
there
during
the
session
;
the
Government
clerk
and
officer
employ
in
the
various
department
;
the
keeper
of
the
hotel
and
boarding
-
house
;
and
the
tradesman
who
supply
their
table
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
unhealthy
.
 
<EOS>
few
people
would
live
in
Washington
<EOS>
,
I
take
it
,
who
be
not
oblige
to
reside
there
;
and
the
tide
of
emigration
and
speculation
,
those
rapid
and
regardless
current
,
be
little
likely
to
flow
at
any
time
towards
such
dull
and
sluggish
water
.
   
<EOS>
the
principal
feature
of
the
Capitol
,
be
,
of
course
,
the
two
house
of
Assembly
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
,
besides
,
in
the
centre
of
the
building
,
a
fine
rotunda
,
ninety
-
six
foot
in
diameter
,
and
ninety
-
six
high
,
whose
circular
wall
be
divide
into
compartment
,
ornament
by
historical
picture
.
 
<EOS>
four
of
these
have
for
their
subject
prominent
event
in
the
revolutionary
struggle
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
paint
by
Colonel
Trumbull
,
himself
a
member
of
Washington
's
staff
at
the
time
of
their
occurrence
;
from
which
circumstance
they
derive
a
peculiar
interest
of
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
same
hall
Mr
Greenough
's
large
statue
of
Washington
have
be
lately
place
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
great
merit
of
course
,
but
it
strike
me
as
be
rather
strained
and
violent
for
its
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
wish
,
however
,
to
have
see
it
in
a
well
light
than
it
can
ever
be
view
in
,
where
it
stand
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
very
pleasant
and
commodious
library
in
the
Capitol
;
and
from
a
balcony
in
front
,
the
bird's
-
eye
view
,
of
which
I
have
just
speak
,
may
be
have
,
together
with
a
beautiful
prospect
of
the
adjacent
country
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
of
the
ornamented
portion
of
the
building
,
there
be
a
figure
of
Justice
;
whereunto
the
Guide
Book
say
,
"
the
artist
at
first
contemplate
give
more
of
nudity
,
but
he
be
warn
that
the
public
sentiment
in
this
country
would
not
admit
of
it
,
and
in
his
caution
he
have
go
,
perhaps
,
into
the
opposite
extreme
.
"
 
<EOS>
Poor
Justice
!
<EOS>
she
have
be
make
to
wear
much
strange
garment
in
America
than
those
she
pine
in
,
in
the
Capitol
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
hope
that
she
have
change
her
dress
-
maker
since
they
be
fashioned
,
and
that
the
public
sentiment
of
the
country
do
not
cut
out
the
clothe
she
hide
her
lovely
figure
in
,
just
now
.
   
<EOS>
the
House
of
Representatives
be
a
beautiful
and
spacious
hall
,
of
semicircular
shape
,
support
by
handsome
pillar
.
 
<EOS>
one
part
of
the
gallery
be
appropriate
to
the
lady
,
and
there
they
sit
in
front
row
,
and
come
in
,
and
go
out
,
as
at
a
play
or
concert
.
 
<EOS>
the
chair
be
canopy
,
and
raise
considerably
above
the
floor
of
the
House
;
and
every
member
have
an
easy
chair
and
a
write
desk
to
himself
:
which
be
denounce
by
some
people
out
of
door
as
a
most
unfortunate
and
injudicious
arrangement
,
tend
to
long
sitting
and
prosaic
speech
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
elegant
chamber
to
look
at
,
but
a
singularly
bad
one
for
all
purpose
of
hearing
.
 
<EOS>
the
Senate
,
which
be
small
,
be
free
from
this
objection
,
and
be
exceedingly
well
adapt
to
the
use
for
which
it
be
design
.
 
<EOS>
the
sitting
,
I
need
hardly
add
,
take
place
in
the
day
;
and
the
parliamentary
form
be
model
on
those
of
the
old
country
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
sometimes
ask
,
in
my
progress
through
other
place
,
whether
I
have
not
be
very
much
impress
by
the
HEADS
of
the
lawmaker
at
Washington
;
<EOS>
mean
not
their
chief
and
leader
,
but
literally
their
individual
and
personal
head
,
whereon
their
hair
grow
,
and
whereby
the
phrenological
character
of
each
legislator
be
express
:
 
and
I
almost
as
often
strike
my
questioner
dumb
with
indignant
consternation
by
answer
"
no
,
that
I
do
not
remember
be
at
all
overcome
.
"
 
<EOS>
as
I
must
,
at
whatever
hazard
,
repeat
the
avowal
here
,
I
will
follow
it
up
by
relate
my
impression
on
this
subject
in
as
few
word
as
possible
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
---
it
may
be
from
some
imperfect
development
of
my
organ
of
veneration
---
I
do
not
remember
have
ever
faint
away
,
or
have
even
be
move
to
tear
of
joyful
pride
,
at
sight
of
any
legislative
body
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
bear
the
House
of
Commons
like
a
man
,
and
have
yield
to
no
weakness
,
but
slumber
,
in
the
House
of
Lords
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
election
for
borough
and
county
,
and
have
never
be
impel
(
no
matter
which
party
win
)
to
damage
my
hat
by
throw
it
up
into
the
air
in
triumph
,
or
to
crack
my
voice
by
shout
forth
any
reference
to
our
Glorious
Constitution
,
to
the
noble
purity
of
our
independent
voter
,
or
,
the
unimpeachable
integrity
of
our
independent
member
.
 
<EOS>
have
withstand
such
strong
attack
upon
my
fortitude
,
it
be
possible
that
I
may
be
of
a
cold
and
insensible
temperament
,
amount
to
iciness
,
in
such
matter
;
and
therefore
my
impression
of
the
live
pillar
of
the
Capitol
at
Washington
must
be
receive
with
such
grain
of
allowance
as
this
free
confession
may
seem
to
demand
.
   
<EOS>
do
I
see
in
this
public
body
an
assemblage
of
man
,
bind
together
in
the
sacred
name
of
Liberty
and
Freedom
,
and
so
assert
the
chaste
dignity
of
those
twin
goddess
,
in
all
their
discussion
,
as
to
exalt
at
once
the
Eternal
Principles
to
which
their
name
be
give
,
and
their
own
character
and
the
character
of
their
countryman
,
in
the
admire
eye
of
the
whole
world
?
   
<EOS>
It
be
but
<EOS>
a
week
,
since
an
aged

grey

a
lasting
honour
to
the
land
that
give
him
birth

who
have
do
good
service
to
his

as
his

and
who
will
be
remember
score
upon
score
of

<EOS>
after
the
worm
breed
in
its
corruption
,
be
but
so
many
grain
of
dust
---
<EOS>
it
be
but
<EOS>
a
week
,
since
this
old
man
have
stand
for
day
upon
his
trial
before
this
very
body

charge
with
have
dare
to
assert
the
infamy
of
that
traffic

which
have

its
accursed

and
their
unborn
child

<EOS>
yes
.
 
and
publicly
exhibit
in
the
same
city
all
the
while
;
gild
,
frame
and
glaze
hang
up
for
general
admiration
;
show
to
stranger
not
with
shame
,
but
pride
;
its
face
not
turn
towards
the
wall
,
itself
not
take
down

burn

be
the
Unanimous
Declaration
of

<EOS>
It
be
not
a
month
,
since
this
same
body
have
sit
calmly
by
,
and
hear
a
man
,
one
of
themselves
,
with
oath
which
beggar
in
their

<EOS>
there
he
sit
,
among
them
;
not
crush
by
the
general
feeling
of
the
assembly
,
but
as
good
a
man
as
any

<EOS>
there
be
but
a
week
to
come
,
and
another

that

for
do
his

him
there
;
for
claim
in
a
Republic
the
Liberty

Freedom

find
guilty

have
strong
censure
pass
upon

<EOS>
His
be
a
grave
offence
indeed

for

he
have
rise
up

but
there

they
go
variously
armed
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
Inalienable
Right
of
some
among
them
,
to
take
the
field
after
THEIR
Happiness
equip
with
cat
and
cartwhip
,
stock
,
and
iron
collar
,
and
to
shout
their
view
halloa
!
<EOS>
(
always
in
praise
of
Liberty
)
to
the
music
of
clank
chain
and
bloody
stripe
.
   
<EOS>
where
sit
the
many
legislator
of
coarse
threat
;
of
word
and
blow
such
as
coalheaver
deal
upon
each
other
,
when
they
forget
their
breeding
?
 
<EOS>
on
every
side
.
 
<EOS>
every
session
have
its
anecdote
of
that
kind
,
and
the
actor
be
all
there
.
   
<EOS>
do
I
recognise
in
this
assembly
,
a
body
of
man
,
who
,
apply
themselves
in
a
new
world
to
correct
some
of
the
falsehood
and
vice
of
the
old
,
purify
the
avenue
to
Public
Life
,
pave
the
dirty
way
to
Place
and
Power
,
debate
and
make
law
for
the
Common
Good
,
and
have
no
party
but
their
country
?
   
<EOS>
I
see
in
them
,
the
wheel
that
move
the
mean
perversion
of
virtuous
Political
Machinery
that
the
bad
tool
ever
work
.
<EOS>
despicable
trickery
at
election
;
under
-
handed
tampering
with
public
officer
<EOS>
;
cowardly
attack
upon
opponent
,
with
scurrilous
newspaper
for
shield
,
and
hire
pen
for
dagger
;
shameful
truckling
to
mercenary
knave
,
whose
claim
to
be
consider
,
be
,
that
every
day
and
week
they
sow
new
crop
of
ruin
with
their
venal
type
,
which
be
the
dragon
's
tooth
of
yore
,
in
everything
but
sharpness
;
aiding
and
abetting
of
every
bad
inclination
in
the
popular
mind
,
and
artful
suppression
of
all
its
good
influence
:
such
thing
as
these
,
and
in
a
word
,
dishonest
Faction
in
its
most
depraved
and
most
unblushing
form
,
stare
out
from
every
corner
of
the
crowded
hall
.
   
<EOS>
do
I
see
among
them
,
the
intelligence
and
refinement
:
 
the
true
,
honest
,
patriotic
heart
of
America
?
 
<EOS>
here
and
there
,
be
drop
of
its
blood
and
life
,
but
they
scarcely
colour
the
stream
of
desperate
adventurer
which
set
that
way
for
profit
and
for
pay
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
game
of
these
man
,
and
of
their
profligate
organ
,
to
make
the
strife
of
politic
so
fierce
and
brutal
,
and
so
destructive
of
all
self
-
respect
in
worthy
man
,
that
sensitive
and
delicate
-
minded
person
shall
be
keep
aloof
,
and
they
,
and
such
as
they
,
be
leave
to
battle
out
their
selfish
view
unchecked
.
 
<EOS>
and
thus
this
low
of
all
scramble
fight
go
on
,
and
they
who
in
other
country
would
,
from
their
intelligence
and
station
,
most
aspire
to
make
the
law
<EOS>
,
do
here
recoil
the
farth
from
that
degradation
.
   
<EOS>
that
there
be
,
among
the
representative
of
the
people
in
both
Houses
,
and
among
all
party
,
some
man
of
high
character
and
great
ability
,
I
need
not
say
.
 
<EOS>
the
foremost
among
those
politician
who
be
know
in
Europe
,
have
be
already
describe
,
and
I
see
no
reason
to
depart
from
the
rule
I
have
lay
down
for
my
guidance
,
of
abstain
from
all
mention
of
individual
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
sufficient
to
add
,
<EOS>
that
to
the
most
favourable
account
that
have
be
write
of
them
,
I
more
than
fully
and
most
heartily
subscribe
;
and
that
personal
intercourse
and
free
communication
have
breed
within
me
,
not
the
result
predict
in
the
very
doubtful
proverb
,
but
increase
admiration
and
respect
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
strike
man
to
look
at
,
hard
to
deceive
,
prompt
to
act
,
lion
in
energy
,
crichton
in
varied
accomplishment
,
Indians
in
fire
of
eye
and
gesture
,
Americans
in
strong
and
generous
impulse
;
and
they
as
well
represent
the
honour
and
wisdom
of
their
country
at
home
,
as
the
distinguished
gentleman
who
be
now
its
Minister
at
the
British
Court
sustain
its
high
character
abroad
.
   
<EOS>
I
visit
both
house
nearly
every
day
,
during
my
stay
in
Washington
.
 
<EOS>
on
my
initiatory
visit
to
the
House
of
Representatives
,
they
divide
against
a
decision
of
the
chair
;
but
the
chair
win
.
 
<EOS>
the
second
time
I
go
,
the
member
who
be
speak
,
be
interrupt
by
a
laugh
,
mimic
it
,
as
one
child
would
in
quarrel
with
another
,
and
add
,
"
that
he
would
make
honourable
gentleman
opposite
,
sing
out
a
little
more
on
the
other
side
of
their
mouth
presently
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
interruption
be
rare
;
the
speaker
be
usually
hear
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
more
quarrel
than
with
us
,
and
more
threatening
than
gentleman
be
accustomed
to
exchange
in
any
civilised
society
of
which
we
have
record
:
 
but
farm
-
yard
imitation
have
not
as
yet
be
import
from
the
Parliament
of
the
United
Kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
the
feature
in
oratory
which
appear
to
be
the
most
practised
,
and
most
relished
,
be
the
constant
repetition
of
the
same
idea
or
shadow
of
an
idea
in
fresh
word
;
and
the
inquiry
out
of
door
be
not
,
"
what
do
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
but
,
"
how
long
do
he
speak
?
"
 
<EOS>
these
,
however
,
be
but
enlargement
of
a
principle
which
prevail
elsewhere
.
   
<EOS>
the
Senate
be
a
dignified
and
decorous
body
,
and
its
proceeding
be
conduct
with
much
gravity
and
order
.
 
<EOS>
both
house
be
handsomely
carpet
;
but
the
state
to
which
these
carpet
be
reduce
by
the
universal
disregard
of
the
spittoon
with
which
every
honourable
member
be
accommodate
,
and
the
extraordinary
improvement
on
the
pattern
which
be
squirt
and
dabble
upon
it
in
every
direction
,
do
not
admit
of
be
describe
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
merely
observe
,
that
I
strongly
recommend
all
stranger
not
to
look
at
the
floor
;
and
if
they
happen
to
drop
anything
,
though
it
be
their
purse
,
not
to
pick
it
up
with
an
ungloved
hand
on
any
account
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
somewhat
remarkable
too
,
at
first
,
to
say
the
least
,
to
see
so
many
honourable
member
with
swelled
face
;
and
it
be
scarcely
less
remarkable
to
discover
that
this
appearance
be
cause
by
the
quantity
of
tobacco
they
contrive
to
stow
within
the
hollow
of
the
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
strange
enough
too
,
to
see
an
honourable
gentleman
lean
back
in
his
tilt
chair
with
his
leg
on
the
desk
before
him
,
shape
a
convenient
"
plug
"
with
his
penknife
,
and
when
it
be
quite
ready
for
use
,
shoot
the
old
one
from
his
mouth
,
as
from
a
pop
-
gun
,
and
clap
the
new
one
in
its
place
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
surprised
to
observe
that
even
steady
old
chewer
of
great
experience
,
be
not
always
good
marksman
,
which
have
rather
incline
me
to
doubt
that
general
proficiency
with
the
rifle
,
of
which
we
have
hear
so
much
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
several
gentleman
call
upon
me
who
,
in
the
course
of
conversation
,
frequently
miss
the
spittoon
at
five
pace
;
and
one
(
<EOS>
but
he
be
certainly
short
-
sighted
)
<EOS>
mistake
the
closed
sash
for
the
open
window
,
at
three
.
 
<EOS>
on
another
occasion
,
when
I
dine
out
,
and
be
sit
with
two
lady
and
some
gentleman
round
a
fire
before
dinner
<EOS>
,
one
of
the
company
fall
short
of
the
fireplace
,
six
distinct
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
dispose
to
think
,
however
,
that
this
be
occasion
by
his
not
aim
at
that
object
;
as
there
be
a
white
marble
hearth
before
the
fender
,
which
be
more
convenient
,
and
may
have
suit
his
purpose
better
.
   
<EOS>
the
Patent
Office
at
Washington
,
furnish
an
extraordinary
example
of
american
enterprise
and
ingenuity
;
for
the
immense
number
of
model
it
contain
be
the
accumulated
invention
of
only
five
year
;
the
whole
of
the
previous
collection
have
be
destroy
by
fire
.
 
<EOS>
the
elegant
structure
in
which
they
be
arrange
be
one
of
design
rather
than
execution
,
for
there
be
but
one
side
erect
out
of
four
,
though
the
work
be
stop
.
 
<EOS>
the
Post
Office
be
a
very
compact
and
very
beautiful
building
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
of
the
department
,
among
a
collection
of
rare
and
curious
article
,
be
deposit
the
present
which
have
be
make
from
time
to
time
to
the
american
ambassador
at
foreign
court
by
the
various
potentate
to
whom
they
be
the
accredited
agent
of
the
Republic
;
gift
<EOS>
which
by
the
law
they
be
not
permit
to
retain
.
 
<EOS>
I
confess
that
I
look
upon
this
as
a
very
painful
exhibition
,
and
one
by
no
mean
flattering
to
the
national
standard
of
honesty
and
honour
.
<EOS>
that
can
scarcely
be
a
high
state
of
moral
feeling
which
imagine
a
gentleman
of
repute
and
station
,
likely
to
be
corrupt
,
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
,
by
the
present
of
a
snuff
-
box
,
or
a
richly
-
mount
sword
,
or
an
eastern
shawl
;
and
surely
the
nation
who
repose
confidence
in
her
appoint
servant
,
be
likely
to
be
better
serve
,
than
she
who
make
them
the
subject
of
such
very
mean
and
paltry
suspicion
.
   
<EOS>
at
George
Town
,
in
the
suburb
,
there
be
a
Jesuit
College
;
delightfully
situate
,
and
,
so
far
as
I
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
,
well
manage
.
 
<EOS>
many
person
who
be
not
member
of
the
Romish
Church
,
avail
themselves
,
I
believe
,
of
these
institution
,
and
of
the
advantageous
opportunity
they
afford
for
the
education
of
their
child
.
 
<EOS>
the
height
of
this
neighbourhood
,
above
the
Potomac
River
,
be
very
picturesque
:
 
and
be
free
,
I
should
conceive
,
from
some
of
the
insalubrity
of
Washington
.
 
<EOS>
the
air
,
at
that
elevation
,
be
quite
cool
and
refreshing
,
when
in
the
city
it
be
burn
hot
.
   
<EOS>
the
President
's
mansion
be
more
like
an
english
club
-
house
,
both
within
and
without
,
than
any
other
kind
of
establishment
with
which
I
can
compare
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
ornamental
ground
about
it
have
be
lay
out
in
garden
walk
;
they
be
pretty
,
and
agreeable
to
the
eye
;
though
they
have
that
uncomfortable
air
of
have
be
make
yesterday
,
which
be
far
from
favourable
to
the
display
of
such
beauty
.
   
<EOS>
My
first
visit
to
this
house
be
on
the
morning
after
my
arrival
,
when
I
be
carry
thither
by
an
official
gentleman
,
who
be
so
kind
as
to
charge
himself
with
my
presentation
to
the
President
.
   
<EOS>
We
enter
a
large
hall
,
and
have
twice
or
thrice
rung
a
bell
which
nobody
answer
,
walk
without
further
ceremony
through
the
room
on
the
ground
floor
,
as
diver
other
gentleman
(
mostly
with
their
hat
on
,
and
their
hand
in
their
pocket
)
be
do
very
leisurely
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
these
have
lady
with
them
,
to
whom
they
be
show
the
premise
;
other
be
lounge
on
the
chair
and
sofa
;
other
,
in
a
perfect
state
of
exhaustion
from
listlessness
,
be
yawn
drearily
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
portion
of
this
assemblage
be
rather
assert
their
supremacy
than
do
anything
else
,
as
they
have
no
particular
business
there
,
that
anybody
know
of
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
be
closely
eye
the
movable
,
as
if
to
make
quite
sure
that
the
President
(
who
be
far
from
popular
)
have
not
make
away
with
any
of
the
furniture
,
or
sell
the
fixture
for
his
private
benefit
.
   
<EOS>
after
glance
at
these
lounger
;
who
be
scatter
over
a
pretty
drawing
-
room
,
opening
upon
a
terrace
which
command
a
beautiful
prospect
of
the
river
and
the
adjacent
country
;
and
who
be
saunter
,
too
,
about
a
large
state
-
room
call
the
Eastern
Drawing
-
room
;
we
go
up
-
stair
into
another
chamber
,
where
be
certain
visitor
,
wait
for
audience
.
 
<EOS>
at
sight
of
my
conductor
,
a
black
in
plain
clothe
and
yellow
slipper
who
be
glide
noiselessly
about
,
and
whisper
message
in
the
ear
of
the
more
impatient
,
make
a
sign
of
recognition
,
and
glide
off
to
announce
him
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
previously
look
into
another
chamber
fit
all
round
with
a
great
,
bare
,
wooden
desk
or
counter
,
whereon
lie
file
of
newspaper
,
to
which
sundry
gentleman
be
refer
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
such
mean
of
beguile
the
time
in
this
apartment
,
which
be
as
unpromising
and
tiresome
as
any
waiting
-
room
in
one
of
our
public
establishment
,
or
any
physician
's
dining
-
room
during
his
hour
of
consultation
at
home
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
some
fifteen
or
twenty
person
in
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
one
,
a
tall
,
wiry
,
muscular
old
man
,
from
the
west
;
sunburnt
and
swarthy
;
with
a
brown
white
hat
on
his
knee
,
and
a
giant
umbrella
rest
between
his
leg
;
who
sit
bolt
upright
in
his
chair
,
frown
steadily
at
the
carpet
,
and
twitch
the
hard
line
about
his
mouth
,
as
if
he
have
make
up
his
mind
"
to
fix
"
the
President
on
what
he
have
to
say
,
and
would
not
bate
him
a
grain
.
 
<EOS>
another
,
a
Kentucky
farmer
,
six
-
foot
-
six
in
height
,
with
his
hat
on
,
and
his
hand
under
his
coat
-
tail
,
who
lean
against
the
wall
and
kick
the
floor
with
his
heel
,
as
though
he
have
Time
's
head
under
his
shoe
,
and
be
literally
"
kill
"
him
.
 
<EOS>
a
third
,
an
oval
-
faced
,
bilious
-
looking
man
,
with
sleek
black
hair
crop
close
,
and
whisker
and
beard
shave
down
to
blue
dot
,
who
suck
the
head
of
a
thick
stick
,
and
from
time
to
time
take
it
out
of
his
mouth
,
to
see
how
it
be
get
on
.
 
<EOS>
a
fourth
do
nothing
but
whistle
.
 
<EOS>
a
fifth
do
nothing
but
spit
.
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
all
these
gentleman
be
so
very
persevering
and
energetic
in
this
latter
particular
,
and
bestow
their
favour
so
abundantly
upon
the
carpet
,
that
I
take
it
for
grant
the
presidential
housemaid
<EOS>
have
high
wage
,
or
,
to
speak
more
genteelly
,
an
ample
amount
of
"
compensation
:
"
which
be
the
american
word
for
salary
,
in
the
case
of
all
public
servant
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
not
wait
in
this
room
many
minute
,
before
the
black
messenger
return
,
and
conduct
us
into
another
of
small
dimension
,
where
,
at
a
business
-
like
table
cover
with
paper
,
sit
the
President
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
somewhat
worn
and
anxious
,
and
well
he
may
;
be
at
war
with
everybody
---
but
the
expression
of
his
face
be
mild
and
pleasant
,
and
his
manner
be
remarkably
unaffected
,
gentlemanly
,
and
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
that
in
his
whole
carriage
and
demeanour
,
he
become
his
station
singularly
well
.
   
<EOS>
be
advise
that
the
sensible
etiquette
of
the
republican
court
admit
of
a
traveller
,
like
myself
,
decline
,
without
any
impropriety
,
an
invitation
to
dinner
,
which
do
not
reach
me
until
I
have
conclude
my
arrangement
for
leave
Washington
some
day
before
that
<EOS>
to
which
it
refer
,
I
only
return
to
this
house
once
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
on
the
occasion
of
one
of
those
general
assembly
which
be
hold
on
certain
night
,
between
the
hour
of
nine
and
twelve
o'clock
,
and
be
call
,
rather
oddly
,
Levees
.
   
<EOS>
I
go
,
with
my
wife
,
at
about
ten
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
pretty
dense
crowd
of
carriage
and
people
in
the
court
-
yard
,
and
so
far
as
I
could
make
out
,
there
be
no
very
clear
regulation
for
the
taking
up
or
set
down
of
company
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
certainly
no
policeman
to
soothe
startled
horse
,
either
by
saw
at
their
bridle
or
flourish
truncheon
in
their
eye
;
and
I
be
ready
to
make
oath
that
no
inoffensive
person
be
knock
violently
on
the
head
,
or
poke
acutely
in
their
back
or
stomach
;
or
bring
to
a
standstill
by
any
such
gentle
mean
,
and
then
take
into
custody
for
not
move
on
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
confusion
or
disorder
.
 
<EOS>
Our
carriage
reach
the
porch
in
its
turn
,
without
any
blustering
,
swear
,
shouting
,
backing
,
or
other
disturbance
:
 
and
we
dismount
with
as
much
ease
and
comfort
as
though
we
have
be
escort
by
the
whole
Metropolitan
Force
from
A
to
z
inclusive
.
   
<EOS>
the
suite
of
room
on
the
ground
-
floor
be
light
up
,
and
a
military
band
be
play
in
the
hall
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
small
drawing
-
room
,
the
centre
of
a
circle
of
company
,
be
the
President
and
his
daughter
-
in
-
law
,
who
act
as
the
lady
of
the
mansion
;
and
a
very
interesting
,
graceful
,
and
accomplished
lady
too
.
 
<EOS>
one
gentleman
who
stand
among
this
group
,
appear
to
take
upon
himself
the
function
of
a
master
of
the
ceremony
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
no
other
officer
or
attendant
,
and
none
be
need
.
   
<EOS>
the
great
drawing
-
room
,
which
I
have
already
mention
,
and
the
other
chamber
on
the
ground
-
floor
,
be
crowd
to
excess
.
 
<EOS>
the
company
be
not
,
in
our
sense
of
the
term
,
select
,
for
it
comprehend
person
of
very
many
grade
and
class
;
nor
be
there
any
great
display
of
costly
attire
:
 
indeed
,
some
of
the
costume
may
have
be
,
for
aught
I
know
,
grotesque
enough
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
decorum
and
propriety
of
behaviour
which
prevail
,
be
unbroken
by
any
rude
or
disagreeable
incident
;
and
every
man
,
even
among
the
miscellaneous
crowd
in
the
hall
who
be
admit
without
any
order
or
ticket
to
look
on
,
appear
to
feel
that
he
be
a
part
of
the
institution
,
and
be
responsible
for
its
preserving
a
become
character
,
and
appear
to
the
good
advantage
.
   
<EOS>
that
these
visitor
,
too
,
whatever
their
station
,
be
not
without
some
refinement
of
taste
and
appreciation
of
intellectual
gift
,
and
gratitude
to
those
man
who
,
by
the
peaceful
exercise
of
great
ability
,
shed
new
charm
and
association
upon
the
home
of
their
countryman
,
and
elevate
their
character
in
other
land
,
be
most
earnestly
testify
by
their
reception
of
Washington
Irving
,
my
dear
friend
,
who
have
recently
be
appoint
Minister
at
the
court
of
Spain
,
and
who
be
among
them
that
night
,
in
his
new
character
,
for
the
first
and
last
time
before
go
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
I
sincerely
believe
that
in
all
the
madness
of
american
politic
,
few
public
man
would
have
be
so
earnestly
,
devotedly
,
and
affectionately
caress
,
as
this
most
charming
writer
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
seldom
respect
a
public
assembly
more
,
than
I
do
this
eager
throng
,
when
I
see
them
turn
with
one
mind
from
noisy
orator
and
officer
of
state
,
and
flock
with
a
generous
and
honest
impulse
round
the
man
of
quiet
pursuit
:
 
proud
in
his
promotion
as
reflect
back
upon
their
country
:
 
and
grateful
to
him
with
their
whole
heart
for
the
store
of
graceful
fancy
he
have
pour
out
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
long
may
he
dispense
such
treasure
with
unsparing
hand
;
and
long
may
they
remember
him
as
worthily
!
   
<EOS>
the
term
we
have
assign
for
the
duration
of
our
stay
in
Washington
be
now
at
an
end
,
and
we
be
to
begin
to
travel
;
for
the
railroad
distance
we
have
traverse
yet
,
in
journey
among
these
old
town
,
be
on
that
great
continent
look
upon
as
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
at
first
intend
go
South
---
to
Charleston
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
I
come
to
consider
the
length
of
time
which
this
journey
would
occupy
,
and
the
premature
heat
of
the
season
,
which
even
at
Washington
have
be
often
very
trying
;
and
weigh
moreover
,
in
my
own
mind
,
the
pain
of
live
in
the
constant
contemplation
of
slavery
,
against
the
more
than
doubtful
chance
of
my
ever
see
it
,
in
the
time
I
have
to
spare
,
strip
of
the
disguise
in
which
it
would
certainly
be
dress
,
and
so
add
any
item
to
the
host
of
fact
already
heap
together
on
the
subject
;
I
begin
to
listen
to
old
whispering
which
have
often
be
present
to
me
at
home
in
England
,
when
I
little
thought
of
ever
be
here
;
and
to
dream
again
of
city
grow
up
,
like
palace
in
fairy
tale
,
among
the
wild
and
forest
of
the
west
.
   
<EOS>
the
advice
I
receive
in
most
quarter
when
I
begin
to
yield
to
my
desire
of
travel
towards
that
point
of
the
compass
be
,
accord
to
custom
,
sufficiently
cheerless
:
 
<EOS>
my
companion
be
threaten
with
more
peril
,
danger
,
and
discomfort
,
than
I
can
remember
or
would
catalogue
if
I
could
;
but
of
which
it
will
be
sufficient
to
remark
that
blowing
-
up
in
steamboat
and
breaking
-
down
in
coach
be
among
the
least
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
have
a
western
route
sketch
out
for
me
by
the
good
and
kind
authority
to
which
I
could
have
resort
,
and
put
no
great
faith
in
these
discouragement
,
I
soon
determine
on
my
plan
of
action
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
to
travel
south
,
only
to
Richmond
in
Virginia
;
and
then
to
turn
,
and
shape
our
course
for
the
Far
West
;
whither
I
beseech
the
reader
's
company
,
in
a
new
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter

and

<EOS>
a
Canal
Boat
 
<EOS>
we
be
to
proceed
in
the
first
instance
by
steamboat
;
and
as
it
be
usual
to
sleep
on
board
,
in
consequence
of
the
starting
-
hour
be
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
we
go
down
to
where
she
lie
,
at
that
very
uncomfortable
time
for
such
expedition
when
slipper
be
most
valuable
,
and
a
familiar
bed
,
in
the
perspective
of
an
hour
or
two
,
look
uncommonly
pleasant
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
ten
o'clock
at
night
:
 
say
<EOS>
half
-
past
ten
:
 
moonlight
,
warm
,
and
dull
enough
.
 
<EOS>
the
steamer
(
not
unlike
a
child
's
Noah
's
ark
in
form
,
with
the
machinery
on
the
top
of
the
roof
)
be
ride
lazily
up
and
down
,
and
bump
clumsily
against
the
wooden
pier
,
as
the
ripple
of
the
river
trifle
with
its
unwieldy
carcase
.
 
<EOS>
the
wharf
be
some
distance
from
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nobody
down
here
;
and
one
or
two
dull
lamp
upon
the
steamer
's
deck
be
the
only
sign
of
life
remain
,
when
our
coach
have
drive
away
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
our
footstep
be
hear
upon
the
plank
,
a
fat
negress
,
particularly
favour
by
nature
in
respect
of
bustle
,
emerge
from
some
dark
stair
,
and
marshal
my
wife
towards
the
lady
'
cabin
,
to
which
retreat
she
go
,
follow
by
a
mighty
bale
of
cloak
and
great
-
coat
.
<EOS>
I
valiantly
resolve
not
to
go
to
bed
at
all
,
but
to
walk
up
and
down
the
pier
till
morning
.
   
<EOS>
I
begin
my
promenade
---
think
of
all
kind
of
distant
thing
and
person
,
and
of
nothing
near
---
and
pace
up
and
down
for
half
-
an
-
hour
.
<EOS>
then
I
go
on
board
again
;
and
get
into
the
light
of
one
of
the
lamp
,
look
at
my
watch
and
think
it
must
have
stop
;
and
wonder
what
have
become
of
the
faithful
secretary
whom
I
bring
along
with
me
from
Boston
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
sup
with
our
late
landlord
(
a
Field
Marshal
,
at
least
,
no
doubt
)
in
honour
of
our
departure
,
and
may
be
two
hour
longer
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk
again
,
but
it
get
dull
and
duller
:
 
<EOS>
the
moon
go
down
:
 
<EOS>
next
June
seem
farther
off
in
the
dark
,
and
the
echo
of
my
footstep
make
me
nervous
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
turn
cold
too
;
and
walk
up
and
down
without
my
companion
in
such
lonely
circumstance
,
be
but
poor
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
break
my
staunch
resolution
,
and
think
it
may
be
,
perhaps
,
as
well
to
go
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
I
go
on
board
again
;
open
the
door
of
the
gentleman
's
cabin
and
walk
in
.
 
<EOS>
somehow
or
other
---
from
its
being
so
quiet
,
I
suppose
---
I
have
take
it
into
my
head
that
there
be
nobody
there
.
 
<EOS>
to
my
horror
and
amazement
<EOS>
it
be
full
of
sleeper
in
every
stage
,
shape
,
attitude
,
and
variety
of
slumber
:
 
in
the
berth
,
on
the
chair
,
on
the
floor
,
on
the
table
,
and
particularly
round
the
stove
,
my
detest
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
another
step
forward
,
and
slip
on
the
shine
face
of
a
black
steward
,
who
lie
roll
in
a
blanket
on
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
He
jump
up
,
grin
,
half
in
pain
and
half
in
hospitality
;
<EOS>
whisper
my
own
name
in
my
ear
;
and
grope
among
the
sleeper
,
lead
me
to
my
berth
.
 
<EOS>
stand
beside
it
,
I
count
these
slumber
passenger
,
and
get
past
forty
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
use
in
go
further
,
so
I
begin
to
undress
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
chair
be
all
occupy
,
and
there
be
nothing
else
to
put
my
clothe
on
,
I
deposit
them
upon
the
ground
:
 
not
without
soil
my
hand
,
for
it
be
in
the
same
condition
as
the
carpet
in
the
Capitol
,
and
from
the
same
cause
.
 
<EOS>
have
but
partially
undressed
,
I
clamber
on
my
shelf
,
and
hold
the
curtain
open
for
a
few
minute
while
I
look
round
on
all
my
fellow
-
traveller
again
.
 
<EOS>
that
do
,
I
let
it
fall
on
them
,
and
on
the
world
:
 
turn
round
:
 
and
go
to
sleep
.
   
<EOS>
I
wake
,
of
course
,
when
we
get
under
weigh
,
for
there
be
a
good
deal
of
noise
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
be
then
just
break
.
 
<EOS>
everybody
wake
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
some
be
self
-
possess
directly
,
and
some
be
much
perplex
to
make
out
where
they
be
until
they
have
rub
their
eye
,
and
lean
on
one
elbow
,
look
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
some
yawn
,
some
groan
,
nearly
all
spit
,
and
a
few
get
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
among
the
riser
:
for
it
be
easy
to
feel
,
without
go
into
the
fresh
air
,
that
the
atmosphere
of
the
cabin
be
vile
in
the
last
degree
.
 
<EOS>
I
huddle
on
my
clothe
,
go
down
into
the
fore
-
cabin
,
get
shave
by
the
barber
,
and
wash
myself
.
 
<EOS>
the
washing
and
dress
apparatus
for
the
passenger
generally
<EOS>
,
consist
of
two
jack

towel
,
three
small
wooden
basin
,
a
keg
of
water
and
a

to
serve

out
with
,
six
square
inch
of
looking

glass
,
two
ditto
ditto
of
yellow
soap
,
a
comb
and
brush
for
the
head
,
and
nothing
for
the
tooth
.
 
<EOS>
everybody
use
the
comb
and
brush
,
except
myself
.
 
<EOS>
everybody
stare
to
see
me
use
my
own
;
and
two
or
three
gentleman
be
strongly
disposed
to
banter
me
on
my
prejudice
,
but
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
make
my
toilet
,
I
go
upon
the
hurricane
-
deck
,
and
set
in
for
two
hour
of
hard
walk
up
and
down
.
 
<EOS>
the
sun
be
rise
brilliantly
;
we
be
pass
Mount
Vernon
,
where
Washington
lie
bury
;
the
river
be
wide
and
rapid
;
and
its
bank
be
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
glory
and
splendour
of
the
day
be
come
on
,
and
grow
bright
every
minute
.
   
<EOS>
at
eight
o'clock
,
we
breakfast
in
the
cabin
where
I
pass
the
night
,
but
the
window
and
door
be
all
throw
open
,
and
now
it
be
fresh
enough
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
hurry
or
greediness
apparent
in
the
despatch
of
the
meal
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
long
than
a
travel
breakfast
with
us
;
more
orderly
,
and
more
polite
.
   
<EOS>
soon
after
nine
o'clock
we
come
to
Potomac
Creek
,
where
we
be
to
land
;
and
then
come
the
odd
part
of
the
journey
.
 
<EOS>
seven

<EOS>
some

so
many
monkey

whoop
like

for
the
main
thing
to
be
do
in
all
kind
of

here
,
be
to
make
as
much
noise
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
the
coach
be
something
like
the
french
coach
,
but
not
nearly
so
good
.
 
<EOS>
in
lieu
of
spring
,
they
be
hang
on
band
of
the
strong
leather
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
very
little
choice
or
difference
between
them
;
and
they
may
be
liken
to
the
car
portion
of
the
swing
at
an
English
fair
,
roof
,
put
upon
axle
-
tree
and
wheel
,
and
curtain
with
paint
canva
.
<EOS>
They
be
cover
with
mud
from
the
roof
to
the
wheel
-
tire
,
and
have
never
be
clean
since
they
be
first
build
.
   
<EOS>
the
ticket
we
have
receive

the

be
mark
No%

so
we
belong

<EOS>
No%

<EOS>
I
throw
my
coat
on
the

,
and
hoist
my

her

into
the

<EOS>
It
have
only
one
step
,
and
that
be
about
a
yard
from
the

,
be
usually
approach

there

<EOS>
the
coach
hold
nine
inside
,
have
a
seat
across

where
we
in
England
put
our

so
that
there
be
only
one
feat
more
difficult
in
the
performance
than
get
in

and
that
is
,
get
out

<EOS>
there
be
only
one

passenger

and
he
sit
upon
the

<EOS>
as
I
be
that
one
,
I
climb
up
;
and
while
they
be
strap
the
luggage
on
the
roof
,
and
heap
it
into
a
kind
of
tray
behind

have
a

look

<EOS>
He
be

He

He

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
and
yet
he
wear
a
low

crown
,
broad

black

faintly
shadow
forth
a
kind
of
insane
imitation

<EOS>
but
somebody
in
authority
cry
"
go

<EOS>
as
I

<EOS>
the

and
all
the
coach
follow
in
procession
:

<EOS>
by
the
way
,
whenever
an
Englishman
would
cry
"
all
right
!
"
<EOS>
an
american
cry
"
go
ahead

"
which
be
somewhat
expressive
of
the
national
character
of
the

<EOS>
the
first
half

mile

<EOS>
the

unexpectedly

can
not

for
some

<EOS>
but
we
get
past
even
this

come
to
the
road
itself
,
which
be

of
alternate
swamp

<EOS>
a
tremendous

be
close

the

roll
his

screw
his

up
very

look
straight
between
the

<EOS>
"
We

do
this

<EOS>
He
take
a

dance
on

with
both

We

although
it

know

bloody

from

terrible
conflict
with
the
Indians
which
once
occur
there

<EOS>
It
be
a
good
place
for
such
a
struggle
,
and
,
like
every
other
spot
I
see
associate
with
any
legend
of
that
wild
people
now
so
rapidly
fade
from
the
earth

interest
me
very
much

<EOS>
the
city
be
the
seat

local

of
Virginia

and
in

shady
legislative
hall
,
some
orator
be
drowsily
hold
forth

the
hot
noon
day

<EOS>
by
dint
of
constant
repetition
,
however
,
these
constitutional
sight
have
very
little
more
interest
for
me
than
so
many
parochial
vestry
;
and
I
be
glad
to
exchange
this
one
for
a
lounge
in
a
well
-
arrange
public
library
of
some
ten
thousand
volume
,
and
a
visit
to
a
tobacco
manufactory
,
where
the
workman
be
all
slave
.
   
<EOS>
I
see
in
this
place
the
whole
process
of
pick
,
roll
,
pressing
,
dry
,
pack
in
cask
,
and
branding
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
tobacco
thus
deal
with
,
be
in
course
of
manufacture
for
chewing
;
and
one
would
have
suppose
there
be
enough
in
that
one
storehouse
to
have
fill
even
the
comprehensive
jaws
of
America
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
form
,
the
weed
look
like
the
oil

cake
on
which
we
fatten
cattle
;
and
even
without
reference
to
its
consequence
,
be
sufficiently
uninvite
.
   
<EOS>
many
of
the
workman
appear
to
be
strong
man
,
and
it
be
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
they
be
all
labour
quietly
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
after
two
o'clock
in
the
day
,
they
be
allow
to
sing
,
a
certain
number
at
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
the
hour
strike
while
I
be
there
,
some
twenty
sing
a
hymn
in
part
,
and
sing
it
by
no
means
ill
;
pursue
their
work
meanwhile
.
 
<EOS>
a
bell
ring
as
I
be
about
to
leave
,
and
they
all
pour
forth
into
a
building
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
several
time
that
I
should
like
to
see
them
at
their
meal
;
but
as
the
gentleman
to
whom
I
mention
this
desire
appear
to
be
suddenly
take
rather
deaf
,
I
do
not
pursue
the
request
.
 
<EOS>
of
their
appearance
I
shall
have
something
to
say
,
presently
.
   
<EOS>
on
the
follow
day
,
I
visit
a
plantation
or
farm
,
of
about
twelve
hundred
acre
,
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
here
again
,
although
I
go
down
with
the
owner
of
the
estate
,
to
"
the
quarter
,
"
as
that
part
of
it
in
which
the
slave
live
be
call
,
I
be
not
invite
to
enter
into
any
of
their
hut
.
 
<EOS>
all
I
see
of
them
,
be
,
that
they
be
very
crazy
,
wretched
cabin
,
near
to
which
group
of
half
-
naked
child
bask
in
the
sun
,
or
wallow
on
the
dusty
ground
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
believe
that
this
gentleman
be
a
considerate
and
excellent
master
,
who
inherit
his
fifty
slave
,
and
be
neither
a
buyer
nor
a
seller
of
human
stock
;
and
I
be
sure
,
from
my
own
observation
and
conviction
,
that
he
be
a
kind
-
hearted
,
worthy
man
.
   
<EOS>
the
planter
's
house
be
an
airy
,
rustic
dwelling
,
that
bring
Defoe
's
description
of
such
place
strongly
to
my
recollection
.
<EOS>
the
day
be
very
warm
,
but
the
blind
be
all
closed
,
and
the
window
and
door
set
wide
open
,
a
shady
coolness
rustle
through
the
room
,
which
be
exquisitely
refreshing
after
the
glare
and
heat
without
.
 
<EOS>
before
the
window
be
an
open
piazza
,
where
,
in
what
they
call
the
hot
weather
---
whatever
that
may
be
---
they
sling
hammock
,
and
drink
and
doze
luxuriously
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
their
cool
rejection
may
taste
within
the
hammock
,
but
,
have
experience
,
I
can
report
that
,
out
of
them
,
the
mound
of
ice
and
the
bowl
of
mint
-
julep
and
sherry
-
cobbler
they
make
in
these
latitude
,
be
refreshment
never
to
be
think
of
afterwards
,
in
summer
,
by
those
who
would
preserve
contented
mind
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
two
bridge
across
the
river
:
 
one
belong
to
the
railroad
,
and
the
other
,
which
be
a
very
crazy
affair
,
be
the
private
property
of
some
old
lady
in
the
neighbourhood
,
who
levy
toll
upon
the
townspeople
.
 
<EOS>
cross
this
bridge
,
<EOS>
on
my
way
back
,
I
see
a
notice
paint
on
the
gate
,
caution
all
person
to
drive
slowly
:
 
under
a
penalty
,
if
the
offender
be
a
white
man
,
of
five
dollar
;
if
a
negro
,
fifteen
stripe
.
   
<EOS>
the
same
decay
and
gloom
that
overhang
the
way
by
which
it
be
approach
,
hover
above
the
town
of
Richmond
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
pretty
villas
and
cheerful
house
in
its
street
,
and
nature
smile
upon
the
country
round
;
but
jostle
its
handsome
residence
,
like
slavery
itself
go
hand
in
hand
with
many
lofty
virtue
,
be
deplorable
tenement
,
fence
unrepaired
,
wall
crumble
into
ruinous
heap
.
 
<EOS>
hint
gloomily
at
thing
below
the
surface
,
these
,
and
many
other
token
of
the
same
description
,
force
themselves
upon
the
notice
,
and
be
remember
with
depressing
influence
,
when
lively
feature
be
forget
.
   
<EOS>
to
those
who
be
happily
unaccustomed
to
them
,
the
countenance
in
the
street
and
labouring
-
place
,
too
,
be
shocking
.
 
<EOS>
all
man
who
know
that
there
be
law
against
instruct
slave
,
of
which
the
pain
and
penalty
greatly
exceed
in
their
amount
the
fine
impose
on
those
who
maim
and
torture
them
,
must
be
prepared
to
find
their
face
very
low
in
the
scale
of
intellectual
expression
.
<EOS>
but
the
darkness
---
not
of
skin
,
but
mind
---
which
meet
the
stranger
's
eye
at
every
turn
;
the
brutalizing
and
blot
out
of
all
fairer
character
trace
by
Nature
's
hand
;
immeasurably
outdo
his
bad
belief
.
 
<EOS>
that
travel
creation
of
the
great
satirist
's
brain
,
who
fresh
from
live
among
horse
,
peer
from
a
high
casement
down
upon
his
own
kind
with
tremble
horror
,
be
scarcely
more
repel
and
daunt
by
the
sight
,
than
<EOS>
those
who
look
upon
some
of
these
face
for
the
first
time
must
surely
be
.
   
<EOS>
I
leave
the
last
of
them
behind
me
in
the
person
of
a
wretched
drudge
,
who
,
after
run
to
and
fro
all
day
till
midnight
,
and
mope
in
his
stealthy
wink
of
sleep
upon
the
stair
betweenwhile
,
be
wash
the
dark
passage
at
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
;
and
go
upon
my
way
with
a
grateful
heart
that
I
be
not
doom
to
live
where
slavery
be
,
and
have
never
have
my
sense
blunt
to
its
wrong
and
horror
in
a
slave
-
rock
cradle
.
   
<EOS>
It
have
be
my
intention
to
proceed
by
James
River
and
Chesapeake
Bay
to
Baltimore
;
but
one
of
the
steamboat
be
absent
from
her
station
through
some
accident
,
and
the
mean
of
conveyance
be
consequently
render
uncertain
<EOS>
,
we
return
to
Washington
by
the
way
we
have
come
(
there
be
two
constable
on
board
the
steamboat
,
in
pursuit
of
runaway
slave
)
,
and
halt
there
again
for
one
night
,
go
on
to
Baltimore
next
afternoon
.
   
<EOS>
the
most
comfortable
of
all
the
hotel
of
which
I
have
any
experience
in
the
United
States
,
and
they
be
not
a
few
,
be
Barnum
's
,
in
that
city
:
 
where
the
english
traveller
will
find
curtain
to
his
bed
,
for
the
first
and
probably
the
last
time
in
America
(
this
be
a
disinterested
remark
,
for
I
never
use
them
)
;
and
where
he
will
be
likely
to
have
enough
water
for
wash
himself
,
which
be
not
at
all
a
common
case
.
   
<EOS>
this
capital
of
the
state
of
Maryland
be
a
bustling
,
busy
town
,
with
a
great
deal
of
traffic
of
various
kind
,
and
in
particular
of
water
commerce
.
 
<EOS>
that
portion
of
the
town
which
it
most
favour
be
none
of
the
clean
,
it
be
true
;
but
the
upper
part
be
of
a
very
different
character
,
and
have
many
agreeable
street
and
public
building
.
 
<EOS>
the
Washington
Monument
,
which
be
a
handsome
pillar
with
a
statue
on
its
summit
;
the
Medical
College
;
and
the
Battle
Monument
in
memory
of
an
engagement
with
the
British
at
North
Point
;
be
the
most
conspicuous
among
them
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
very
good
prison
in
this
city
,
and
the
State
Penitentiary
be
also
among
its
institution
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
latter
establishment
there
be
two
curious
case
.
   
<EOS>
one
be
that
of
a
young
man
,
who
have
be
try
for
the
murder
of
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
the
evidence
be
entirely
circumstantial
,
and
be
very
conflicting
and
doubtful
;
nor
be
it
possible
to
assign
any
motive
which
could
have
tempt
him
to
the
commission
of
so
tremendous
a
crime
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
try
twice
;
and
on
the
second
occasion
the
jury
feel
so
much
hesitation
in
convict
him
,
that
they
find
a
verdict
of
manslaughter
,
or
murder
in
the
second
degree
;
which
it
could
not
possibly
be
,
as
there
have
,
beyond
all
doubt
,
be
no
quarrel
or
provocation
,
and
if
he
be
guilty
at
all
,
he
be
unquestionably
guilty
of
murder
in
its
broad
and
bad
signification
.
   
<EOS>
the
remarkable
feature
in
the
case
be
,
that
if
the
unfortunate
deceased
be
not
really
murder
by
this
own
son
of
his
,
he
must
have
be
murder
by
his
own
brother
.
 
<EOS>
the
evidence
lie
in
a
most
remarkable
manner
,
between
those
two
.
 
<EOS>
on
all
the
suspicious
point
,
the
dead
man
's
brother
be
the
witness
:
 
<EOS>
all
the
explanation
for
the
prisoner
(
some
of
them
extremely
plausible
)
go
,
by
construction
and
inference
,
to
inculcate
him
as
plot
to
fix
the
guilt
upon
his
nephew
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
have
be
one
of
them
:
and
the
jury
have
to
decide
between
two
set
of
suspicion
,
almost
equally
unnatural
,
unaccountable
,
and
strange
.
   
<EOS>
the
other
case
,
be
that
of
a
man
who
once
go
to
a
certain
distiller
's
and
steal
a
copper
measure
contain
a
quantity
of
liquor
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
pursue
and
take
with
the
property
in
his
possession
,
and
be
sentence
to
two
year
'
imprisonment
.
 
<EOS>
on
come
out
of
the
jail
,
at
the
expiration
of
that
term
,
he
go
back
to
the
same
distiller
's
,
and
steal
the
same
copper
measure
contain
the
same
quantity
of
liquor
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
not
the
slight
reason
to
suppose
that
the
man
wish
to
return
to
prison
:
 
indeed
everything
,
but
the
commission
of
the
offence
,
make
directly
against
that
assumption
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
only
two
way
of
account
for
this
extraordinary
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
one
be
,
that
after
undergo
so
much
for
this
copper
measure
he
conceive
he
have
establish
a
sort
of
claim
and
right
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
other
that
,
by
dint
of
long
think
about
,
it
have
become
a
monomania
with
him
,
and
have
acquire
a
fascination
which
he
find
it
impossible
to
resist
;
swell
from
an
Earthly
Copper
Gallon
into
an
Ethereal
Golden
Vat
.
   
<EOS>
after
remain
here
a
couple
of
day
I
bind
myself
to
a
rigid
adherence
to
the
plan
I
have
lay
down
so
recently
,
and
resolve
to
set
forward
on
our
western
journey
without
any
more
delay
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
have
reduce
the
luggage
within
the
small
possible
compass
(
by
send
back
to
New
York
,
to
be
afterwards
forward
to
us
in
Canada
,
so
much
of
it
as
be
not
absolutely
want
)
;
and
have
procure
the
necessary
credential
to
banking
-
house
on
the
way
;
and
have
moreover
look
for
two
evening
at
the
set
sun
,
with
as
well
-
define
an
idea
of
the
country
before
us
as
if
we
have
be
go
to
travel
into
the
very
centre
of
that
planet
;
we
leave
Baltimore
by
another
railway
at
half
-
past
eight
in
the
morning
,
and
reach
the
town
of
York
,
some
sixty
mile
off
,
by
the
early
dinner
-
time
of
the
Hotel
which
be
the
start
-
place
of
the
four
-
horse
coach
,
wherein
we
be
to
proceed
to
Harrisburg
.
   
<EOS>
this
conveyance
,
the
box
of
which
I
be
fortunate
enough
to
secure
,
have
come
down
to
meet
us
at
the
railroad
station
,
and
be
as
muddy
and
cumbersome
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
as
more
passenger
be
wait
for
us
at
the
inn
-
door
,
the
coachman
observe
under
his
breath
,
in
the
usual
self
-
communicative
voice
,
look
the
while
at
his
mouldy
harness
as
if
it
be
to
that
he
be
address
himself
,
   
<EOS>
"
I
expect
we
shall
want
the
big
coach
.
"
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
wonder
within
myself
what
the
size
of
this
big
coach
may
be
,
and
how
many
person
it
may
be
design
to
hold
;
for
the
vehicle
which
be
too
small
for
our
purpose
be
something
large
than
two
english
heavy
night
coach
,
and
may
have
be
the
twin
-
brother
of
a
French
Diligence
.
 
<EOS>
My
speculation
be
speedily
set
at
rest
,
however
,
for
as
soon
as
we
have
dine
,
there
come
rumble
up
the
street
,
shake
its
side
like
a
corpulent
giant
,
a
kind
of
barge
on
wheel
.
 
<EOS>
after
much
blundering
and
backing
,
it
stop
at
the
door
:
 
roll
heavily
from
side
to
side
when
its
other
motion
have
cease
,
as
if
it
have
take
cold
in
its
damp
stable
,
and
between
that
,
and
the
having
be
require
in
its
dropsical
old
age
to
move
at
any
fast
pace
than
a
walk
,
be
distress
by
shortness
of
wind
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
if
here
be
not
the
Harrisburg
mail
at
last
,
and
dreadful
bright
and
smart
to
look
at
too
,
"
cry
an
elderly
gentleman
in
some
excitement
,
"
darn
my
mother
!
"
   
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
the
sensation
of
be
darn
may
be
,
or
whether
a
man
's
mother
have
a
keen
relish
or
disrelish
of
the
process
than
anybody
else
;
but
if
the
endurance
of
this
mysterious
ceremony
by
the
old
lady
in
question
have
depend
on
the
accuracy
of
her
son
's
vision
in
respect
to
the
abstract
brightness
and
smartness
of
the
Harrisburg
mail
,
she
would
certainly
have
undergo
its
infliction
.
<EOS>
however
,
they
book
twelve
people
inside
;
and
the
luggage
(
include
such
trifle
as
a
large
rocking
-
chair
,
and
a
good
-
sized
dining
-
table
)
be
at
length
make
fast
upon
the
roof
,
we
start
off
in
great
state
.
   
<EOS>
at
the
door
of
another
hotel
,
there
be
another
passenger
to
be
take
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
any
room
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
cry
the
new
passenger
to
the
coachman
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well
,
there
be
room
enough
,
"
reply
the
coachman
,
without
get
down
,
or
even
look
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
there
an't
no
room
at
all
,
sir
,
"
bawl
a
gentleman
inside
.
 
<EOS>
which
another
gentleman
(
also
inside
)
confirm
,
by
predict
that
the
attempt
to
introduce
any
more
passenger
"
will
not
fit
nohow
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
new
passenger
,
without
any
expression
of
anxiety
,
look
into
the
coach
,
and
then
look
up
at
the
coachman
:
 
<EOS>
"
now
,
how
do
you
mean
to
fix
it
?
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
after
a
pause
:
 
"
for
I
MUST
go
.
"
   
<EOS>
the
coachman
employ
himself
in
twist
the
lash
of
his
whip
into
a
knot
,
and
take
no
more
notice
of
the
question
:
 
clearly
signify
that
it
be
anybody
's
business
but
his
,
and
that
the
passenger
would
do
well
to
fix
it
,
among
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
state
of
thing
,
matter
seem
to
be
approximate

inside

in

who

nearly
suffocate

cry
faintly
,
"
I

get
out

<EOS>
this
be
no
matter
of
relief
or
self
-
congratulation
to
the
driver
,
for
his
immovable
philosophy
be
perfectly
undisturbed
by
anything
that
happen
in
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
of
all
thing
in
the
world
,
the
coach
would
seem
to
be
the
very
last
upon
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
the
exchange
be
make
,
however
,
and
then
the
passenger
who
have
give
up
his
seat
make
a
third
upon
the
box
,
seat
himself
in
what
he
call
the
middle
;
that
is
,
with
half
his
person
on
my
leg
,
and
the
other
half
on
the

cry
the
cap'en
to
his

,
the
horse
,
and
away
we
go
.
   
<EOS>
We
take
up
at
a
rural
bar
-
room
,
after
we
have
go
a
few
mile
,
an
intoxicate
gentleman
who
climb
upon
the
roof
among
the
luggage
,
and
subsequently
slip
off
without
hurt
himself
,
be
see
in
the
distant
perspective
reel
back
to
the
grog

shop
where
we
have
find
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
also
part
with
more
of
our
freight
at
different
time
,
so
that
when
we
come
to
change
horse
,
I
be
again
alone
outside
.
   
<EOS>
the
coachman
always
change
with
the
horse
,
and
be
usually
as
dirty
as
the
coach
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
be
dress
like
a
very
shabby
english
baker
;
the
second
like
a
russian
peasant
:
 
for
he
wear
a
loose
purple
camlet
robe
,
with
a
fur
collar
,
tie
round
his
waist
with
a
parti
-
colour
worsted
sash
;
grey
trouser
;
light
blue
glove
:
 
and
a
cap
of
bearskin
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
by
this
time
come
on
to
rain
very
heavily
,
and
there
be
a
cold
damp
mist
besides
,
which
penetrate
to
the
skin
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
glad
to
take
advantage
of
a
stoppage
and
get
down
to
stretch
my
leg
,
shake
the
water
off
my
great
-
coat
,
and
swallow
the
usual
anti
-
temperance
recipe
for
keep
out
the
cold
.
   
<EOS>
when
I
mount
to
my
seat
again
,
I
observe
a
new
parcel
lie
on
the
coach
roof
,
which
I
take
to
be
a
rather
large
fiddle
in
a
brown
bag
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
a
few
mile
,
however
,
I
discover
that
it
have
a
glazed
cap
at
one
end
and
a
pair
of
muddy
shoe
at
the
other
and
further
observation
demonstrate
it
to
be
a
small
boy
in
a
snuff
-
colour
coat
,
with
his
arm
quite
pinion
to
his
side
,
by
deep
forcing
into
his
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
,
I
presume
,
a
relative
or
friend
of
the
coachman
's
,
as
he
lie
a
-
top
of
the
luggage
with
his
face
towards
the
rain
;
and
except
when
a
change
of
position
bring
his
shoe
in
contact
with
my
hat
,
he
appear
to
be
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
,
on
some
occasion
of
our
stopping
,
this
thing
slowly
upreare
itself
to
the
height
of
three
foot
six
,
and
fix
its
eye
on
me
,
observe
in
piping
accent
,
with
a
complaisant
yawn
,
half
quench
in
an
obliging
air
of
friendly
patronage
,
"

you

the
scenery

which

beautiful

<EOS>
Our
road
wind
through
the
pleasant
valley
of
the
Susquehanna
;
the
river
,
dot
with
innumerable
green
island
,
lie
upon
our
right
;
and
on
the
left
,
a
steep
ascent
,
craggy
with
broken
rock
,
and
dark
with
pine
tree
.
<EOS>
the
mist
,
wreathe
itself
into
a
hundred
fantastic
shape
,
move
solemnly
upon
the
water
;
and
the
gloom
of
evening
give
to
all
an
air
of
mystery
and
silence
which
greatly
enhance
its
natural
interest
.
   
<EOS>
We
cross
this
river
by
a
wooden
bridge
,
roof
and
cover
in
on
all
side
,
and
nearly
a
mile
in
length
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
profoundly
dark
;
perplex
,
with
great
beam
,
cross
and
recrosse
it
at
every
possible
angle
;
and
through
the
broad
chink
and
crevice
in
the
floor
,
the
rapid
river
gleam
,
far
down
below
,
like
a
legion
of
eye
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
no
lamp
;
and
as
the
horse
stumble
and
flounder
through
this
place
,
towards
the
distant
speck
of
die
light
,
it
seem
interminable
.
 
<EOS>
I
really
could
not
at
first
persuade
myself
as
we
rumble
heavily
on
,
fill
the
bridge
with
hollow
noise
,
and
I
hold
down
my
head
to
save
it
from
the
rafter
above
,
but
that
I
be
in
a
painful
dream
;
for
I
have
often
dream
of
toil
through
such
place
,
and
as
often
argue
,
even
at
the
time
,
"
this
can
not
be
reality

"
   
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
we
emerge
upon
the
street
of
Harrisburg
,
whose
feeble
light
,
reflect
dismally
from
the
wet
ground
,
do
not
shine
out
upon
a
very
cheerful
city
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
soon
establish
in
a
snug
hotel
,
which
though
small
and
far
less
splendid
than
many
we
put
up
at

it
raise
above
them
all
in
my
remembrance
,
by
have
for
its
landlord
the
most
obliging
,
considerate
,
and
gentlemanly
person
I
ever
have
to
deal
with
.
   
<EOS>
as
we
be
not
to
proceed
upon
our
journey
until
the
afternoon
,
I
walk
out
,
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
,
to
look
about
me
;
and
be
duly
show
a
model
prison
on
the
solitary
system
,
just
erect
,
and
as
yet
without
an
inmate
;
the
trunk
of
an
old
tree
to
which
Harris
,
the
first
settler
here
(
afterwards
bury
under
it
)
,
be
tie
by
hostile
Indians
,
with
his
funeral
pile
about
him
,
when
he
be
save
by
the
timely
appearance
of
a
friendly
party
on
the
opposite
shore
of
the
river
;
the
local
legislature
(
for
there
be
another
of
those
body
here
again
,
in
full
debate
)
;
and
the
other
curiosity
of
the
town
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
very
much
interested
in
look
over
a
number
of
treaty
make
from
time
to
time
with
the
poor
Indians
,
sign
by
the
different
chief
at
the
period
of
their
ratification
,
and
preserve
in
the
office
of

,
trace
of

by
their
own

,
be
rough

of
the
creature
or
weapon
they
be
call
after

<EOS>
thus
,
the
Great
Turtle
make
a
crooked
pen
-
and
-
ink
outline
of
a
great
turtle
;
the
Buffalo
sketch
a

the
War
Hatchet
set
a
rough

of

weapon
for
his

.
 
<EOS>
so
with
the
Arrow
,
the
fish
,
the
Scalp
,
the
Big
Canoe
,
and
all
of
them
.
   
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
think
---
as
I
look
at
these
feeble
and
tremulous
production
of
hand
which
could
draw
the
long
arrow
to
the
head
in
a
stout
elk
-
horn
bow
,
or
split
a
bead
or
feather
with
a

---
of
Crabbe

musing
over
the
Parish
Register
,
and
the
irregular
scratch
make
with
a
pen
,
by
man
who
would
plough
a
lengthy
furrow
straight
from
end
to
end
.
 
<EOS>
nor
could
I
help
bestow
many
sorrowful
thought
upon
the
simple
warrior
whose
hand
and
heart
be
set
there
,
in
all
truth
and
honesty
;
and
who
only
learn
in
course
of
time
from
white
man
how
to
break
their
faith
,
and
quibble
out
of
form
and
bond
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
,
too
,
how
many
time
the
credulous
Big
Turtle
,
or
trust
Little
Hatchet
,
have
put
his
mark
to
treaty
which
be
falsely
read
to
him
;
and
have
sign
away
,
he
know
not
what
,
until
it
go
and
cast
him
loose
upon
the
new
possessor
of
the
land
,
a
savage
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
Our
host
announce
,
before
our
early
dinner
,
that
some
member
of
the
legislative
body
propose
to
do
us
the
honour
of
call
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
kindly
yield
up
to
us
his
wife
's
own
little
parlour
,
and
when
I
beg
that
he
would
show
them
in
,
I
see
him
look
with
painful
apprehension
at
its
pretty
carpet
;
though
,
be
otherwise
occupy
at
the
time
,
the
cause
of
his
uneasiness
do
not
occur
to
me
.
   
<EOS>
It
certainly
would
have
be
more
pleasant
to
all
party
concern
,
and
would
not
,
I
think
,
have
compromise
their
independence
in
any
material
degree
,
if
some
of
these
gentleman
have
not
only
yield
to
the
prejudice
in
favour
of
spittoon
,
but
have
abandon
themselves
,
for
the
moment
,
even
to
the
conventional
absurdity
of
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
.
   
<EOS>
It
still
continue
to
rain
heavily
,
and
when
we
go
down
to
the
Canal
Boat
<EOS>
(
for
that
be
the
mode
of
conveyance
by
which
we
be
to
proceed
)
after
dinner
,
the
weather
be
as
unpromising
and
obstinately
wet
as
one
would
desire
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
the
sight
of
this
canal
boat
,
in
which
we
be
to
spend
three
or
four
day
,
by
any
mean
a
cheerful
one
;
as
it
involve
some
uneasy
speculation
concern
the
disposal
of
the
passenger
at
night
,
and
open
a
wide
field
of
inquiry
touch
the
other
domestic
arrangement
of
the
establishment
,
which
be
sufficiently
disconcert
.
   
<EOS>
however
,
there
it
be
---
a
barge
with
a
little
house
in
it
,
view
from
the
outside
;
and
a
caravan
at
a
fair
,
view
from
within
:
 
the
gentleman
be
accommodate
,
as
the
spectator
usually
be
,
in
one
of
those
locomotive
museum
of
penny
wonder
;
and
the
lady
be
partition
off
by
a
red
curtain
,
after
the
manner
of
the
dwarf
and
giant
in
the
same
establishment
,
whose
private
life
be
pass
in
rather
close
exclusiveness
.
   
<EOS>
We
sit
here
,
look
silently
at
the
row
of
little
table
,
which
extend
down
both
side
of
the
cabin
,
and
listen
to
the
rain
as
it
drip
and
patter
on
the
boat
,
and
plash
with
a
dismal
merriment
in
the
water
,
until
the
arrival
of
the
railway
train
,
for
whose
final
contribution
to
our
stock
of
passenger
,
our
departure
be
alone
defer

<EOS>
It
bring
a
great
many
box
,
which
be
bump

toss
upon
the

almost
as
painfully
as
if
they
have
be
deposit
on
one

own
head
,
without
the
intervention
of
a
porter

knot
;
and
several
damp
gentleman
,
whose
clothe
,
on
their
drawing
round
the
stove
,
begin
to
steam
again
.
 
<EOS>
no
doubt
it
would
have
be
a
thought
more
comfortable
if
the
drive
rain
,
which
now
pour
down
more
soakingly
than
ever
,
have
admit
of
a
window
be
open
,
or
if
our
number
have
be
something
less
than
thirty
;
but
there
be
scarcely
time
to
think
as
much
,
when
a

attach

the

the

lady
be
seat
;
or
omit
any
little
act
of
politeness
which
could
contribute
to
their
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
nor
do
I
ever
once
,
on
any
occasion
,
anywhere
,
during
my
ramble
in
America
,
see
a
woman
expose
to
the
slight
act
of
rudeness
,
incivility
,
or
even
inattention
.
   
<EOS>
by
the
time
the
meal
be
over
,
the
rain
,
which
seem
to
have
wear
itself
out
by
come
down
so
fast
,
be
nearly
over
too
;
and
it
become
feasible
to
go
on
deck
:
 
which
be
a
great
relief
,
notwithstanding
its
be
a
very
small
deck
,
and
be
render
still
small
by
the
luggage
,
which
be
heap
together
in
the
middle
under
a
tarpaulin
covering
;
leave
,
on
either
side
,
a
path
so
narrow
,
that
it
become
a
science
to
walk
to
and
fro
without
tumble
overboard
into
the
canal
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
somewhat
embarrassing
at
first
,
too
,
to
have
to
duck
nimbly
every
five
minute
whenever
the
man
at
the
helm
cry
"
Bridge
!
"
<EOS>
and
sometimes
,
when
the
cry
be
"
Low
Bridge
,
"
to
lie
down
nearly
flat
.
 
<EOS>
but
custom
familiarise
one
to
anything
,
and
there
be
so
many
bridge
that
it
take
a
very
short
time
to
get
used
to
this
.
   
<EOS>
as
night
come
on
,
and
we
draw
in
sight
of
the
first
range
of
hill
,
which
be
the
outpost
of
the
Alleghany
Mountains
,
the
scenery
,
which
have
be
unintereste
hitherto
,
become
more
bold
and
striking
.
 
<EOS>
the
wet
ground
reek
and
smoke
,
after
the
heavy
fall
of
rain
,
and
the
croaking
of
the
frog
(
whose
noise
in
these
part
be
almost
incredible
)
sound
as
though
a
million
of
fairy
team
with
bell
be
travel
through
the
air
,
and
keep
pace
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
the
night
be
cloudy
yet
,
but
moonlight
too
:
 
and
when
we
cross
the
Susquehanna
river
---
over
which
there
be
an
extraordinary
wooden
bridge
with
two
gallery
,
one
above
the
other
,
so
that
even
there
,
two
boat
team
meeting
,
may
pass
without
confusion
---
it
be
wild
and
grand
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
mention
my
have
be
in
some
uncertainty
and
doubt
,
at
first
,
relative
to
the
sleep
arrangement
on
board
this
boat
.
 
<EOS>
I
remain
in
the
same
vague
state
of
mind
until
ten
o'clock
or
thereabout
,
<EOS>
when
go
below
,
I
find
suspend
on
either
side
of
the
cabin
,
three
long
tier
of
hang
bookshelf
,
design
apparently
for
volume
of
the
small
octavo
size
.
 
<EOS>
look
with
great
attention
at
these
contrivance
(
wonder
to
find
such
literary
preparation
in
such
a
place
)
,
I
descry
on
each
shelf
a
sort
of
microscopic
sheet
and
blanket
;
then
I
begin
dimly
to
comprehend
that
the
passenger
be
the
library
,
and
that
they
be
to
be
arrange
,
edge
-
wise
,
on
these
shelf
,
till
morning
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
assist
to
this
conclusion
by
see
some
of
them
gather
round
<EOS>
the
master
of
the
boat
,
at
one
of
the
table
,
draw
lot
with
all
the
anxiety
and
passion
of
gamester
depict
in
their
countenance
<EOS>
;
while
other
,
with
small
piece
of
cardboard
in
their
hand
,
be
grope
among
the
shelf
in
search
of
number
correspond
with
those
they
have
draw
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
any
gentleman
find
his
number
,
he
take
possession
of
it
by
immediately
undress
himself
and
crawl
into
bed
.
 
<EOS>
the
rapidity
with
which
an
agitate
gambler
subside
into
a
snore
slumberer
,
be
one
of
the
most
singular
effect
I
have
ever
witness
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
the
lady
,
they
be
already
abe
,
behind
the
red
curtain
,
which
be
carefully
draw
and
pin
up
the
centre
;
though
as
every
cough
,
or
sneeze
,
or
whisper
,
behind
this
curtain
,
be
perfectly
audible
before
it
,
we
have
still
a
lively
consciousness
of
their
society
.
   
<EOS>
the
politeness
of
the
person
in
authority
have
secure
to
me
a
shelf
in
a
nook
near
this
red
curtain
,
in
some
degree
remove
from
the
great
body
of
sleeper
:
 
to
which
place
I
retire
,
with
many
acknowledgment
to
him
for
his
attention
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
it
,
on
after
-
measurement
,
just
the
width
of
an
ordinary
sheet
of
Bath
post
letter
-
paper
;
and
I
be
at
first
in
some
uncertainty
as
to
the
good
mean
of
get
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
shelf
be
a
bottom
one
<EOS>
,
I
finally
determine
on
lie
upon
the
floor
,
roll
gently
in
,
stop
immediately
<EOS>
I
touch
the
mattress
,
and
remain
for
the
night
with
that
side
uppermost
,
whatever
it
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
luckily
,
I
come
upon
my
back
at
exactly
the
right
moment
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
much
alarm
on
look
upward
,
to
see
,
by
the
shape
of
his
half
-
yard
of
sack
(
which
his
weight
have
bend
into
an
exceedingly
tight
bag
)
<EOS>
,
that
there
be
a
very
heavy
gentleman
above
me
,
whom
the
slend
cord
seem
quite
incapable
of
hold
;
and
I
could
not
help
reflect
upon
the
grief
of
my
wife
and
family
in
the
event
of
his
come
down
in
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
I
could
not
have
get
up
again
without
a
severe
bodily
struggle
,
which
may
have
alarm
the
lady
;
and
as
I
have
nowhere
to
go
to
,
even
if
I
have
;
I
shut
my
eye
upon
the
danger
,
and
remain
there
.
   
<EOS>
one
of
two
remarkable
circumstance
be
indisputably
a
fact
,
with
reference
to
that
class
of
society
who
travel
in
these
boat
.
<EOS>
either
they
carry
their
restlessness
to
such
a
pitch
that
they
never
sleep
at
all
;
or
they
expectorate
in
dream
,
which
would
be
a
remarkable
mingling
of
the
real
and
ideal
.
 
<EOS>
all
night
long
,
and
every
night
,
on
this
canal
,
there
be
a
perfect
storm
and
temp
of
spit
;
and
once
my
coat
,
be
in
the
very
centre
of
the
hurricane
sustain
by
five
gentleman
(
which
move
vertically

strictly

out
Reid
's
Theory
of

Law
of
Storms

<EOS>
,
I
be
fain
the
next
morning
to
lay
it
on
the
deck
,
and
rub
it
down
with
fair
water
before
it
be
in
a
condition
to
be
wear
again
.
   
<EOS>
between
five
and
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
we
get
up
,
and
some
of
us
go
on
deck
,
to
give
them
an
opportunity
of
take
the
shelf
down
;
while
other
,
the
morning
be
very
cold

crowd
round
the
rusty
stove

cherish
the
newly
kindle
fire

and
fill
the

with
those
voluntary

they
have
be
so
liberal
all
night

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
there
be
a
tin
ladle
chain
to
the
deck
,
with
which
every
gentleman
who
think
it
necessary
to
cleanse
himself
(
many
be
superior
to
this
weakness
)
,
fish
the
dirty
water
out
of
the
canal
,
and
pour
it
into
a
tin
basin
,
secure
in
like
manner

<EOS>
there
be
also
a

<EOS>
at

o'clock

some

and
have
it
all
on

at

dinner

breakfast

<EOS>
there
be
a

with
a
light
fresh

coloured
face
,
and
a
pepper

salt
suit

who
be
the
most
inquisitive
fellow

can
possibly
be
imagine

He
never

interrogatively

He
be
an

<EOS>
sit
down

stand
up

still

walk
the

or
take
his

there

with
a
great
note
of
interrogation
in
each
eye
,
two
in
his
cocked
ear

two
more
in
his
turn
-
up
nose
and
chin
,
at

half
a
dozen
more
about
the
corner
of
his
mouth

and
the
large
one
of
all
in
his

which
be
brush
pertly
off
his

in
a
flaxen
clump

<EOS>
every

in
his

"

<EOS>
what
be
that

<EOS>
do
you
speak
?
 
<EOS>
say
that
again
,
will
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
be
always
wide
awake
,
like
the
enchanted
bride
who
drive
her
husband
frantic

always
restless
;
always
thirst
for

perpetually
seek
and
never

<EOS>
there
never
be
such
a
curious
man

<EOS>
I
wear
a
fur
great
-
coat
at
that
time
,
and
before
we
be
well
clear
of
the
wharf
,
he
question
me
concern
it
,
and
its
price
,
and
where
I
buy
it
,
and
when
,
<EOS>
and
what
fur
it
be
,
and
<EOS>
what
it
weigh
,
and
what
it
cost
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
take
notice
of
my
watch
,
and
ask
me
what
that
cost
,
and
whether
it
be
a
french
watch
,
and
where
I
get
it
,
and
how
I
get
it
,
and
whether
I
buy
it
or
have
it
give
me
,
and
how
it
go
,
and
where
the
key

hole
be
,
and
when
I
wound
it
,
every
night
or
every
morning
,
and
whether
I
ever
forget
to
wind
it
at
all
,
and
if
I
do
,
<EOS>
what
then
?
 
<EOS>
where
have
I
be

say
that

<EOS>
eh

<EOS>
Lor
now
!
<EOS>
do
tell
!
   
<EOS>
find
that
nothing
would
satisfy
him
,
I
evade
his
question
after
the
first
score
or
two
,
and
in
particular
pleaded
ignorance
respect
the
name
of
the
fur
<EOS>
whereof
the
coat
be
make
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
unable
to
say
whether
this
be
the
reason
,
but
that
coat
fascinate
him
afterwards
;
he
usually
keep
close
behind
me
as
I
walk
,
and
move
as
I
move
,
that
he
may
look
at
it
the
well
;
and
he
frequently
dive
into
narrow
place
after
me
at
the
risk
of
his
life
,
that
he
may
have
the
satisfaction
of
pass
his
hand
up
the
back
,
and
rub
it
the
wrong
way
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
another
odd
speciman
on
board
,
of
a
different
kind
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
thin
-
faced
,
spare
-
figured
man
of
middle
age
and
stature
,
dress
in
a
dusty
drabbish

coloured
suit

such
as
I
never
see
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
perfectly
quiet
during
the
first
part
of
the
journey
:
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
do
not
remember
have
so
much
as
see
him
until
he
be
bring
out
by
circumstance
,
as
great
man
often
be
.
 
<EOS>
the
conjunction
of
event
which
make
him
famous
,
happen

briefly
,
thus
.
   
<EOS>
the
canal
extend
to
the
foot
of
the
mountain
,
and
there
,
of
course
,
it
stop
;
the
passenger
be
convey
across
it
by
land
carriage
,
and
take
on
afterwards
by
another
canal
boat
,
the
counterpart
of
the
first
,
which
await
them
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
there
be
two
canal
line
of
passage
-
boat
;
one
be
call
The
Express
,
and
one
(
a
cheap
one
)
<EOS>
the
Pioneer
.
 
<EOS>
the
Pioneer
get
first
to
the
mountain
,
and
wait
for
the
Express
people
to
come
up
;
both
set
of
passenger
be
convey
across
it
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
We
be
the
Express
company
;
but
when
we
have
cross
the
mountain
,
and
have
come
to
the
second
boat
,
the
proprietor
take
it
into
their
bead
to
draft
all
the
Pioneers
into
it
likewise
,
so
that
we
be
five
-
and
-
forty
at
least
,
and
the
accession
of
passenger
be
not
at
all
of
that
kind
which
improve
the
prospect
of
sleep
at
night
.
<EOS>
Our
people
grumble
at
this
,
as
people
do
in
such
case
;
but
suffer
the
boat
to
be
tow
off
with
the
whole
freight
aboard
nevertheless
;
and
away
we
go
down
the
canal
.
 
<EOS>
at
home
,
I
should
have
protest
lustily
,
but
be
a
foreigner
here
,
I
hold
my
peace
.
 
<EOS>
not
so
this
passenger
.
 
<EOS>
He
cleave
a
path
among
the
people
on
deck
(
we
be
nearly
all
on
deck
)
,
and
without
address
anybody
whomsoever
,
soliloquise
as
follow

I

for

I

<EOS>
They

not

they

not

<EOS>
this

pile
of

a
little
too
mountainous

this

"
 
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
every
one
of
these
short
sentence
he
turn
upon
his
heel
,
and
walk
the
other
way
;
check
himself
abruptly
when
he
have
finish
another
short
sentence
,
and
turn
back
again
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
for
me
to
say
what
terrific
meaning
be
hide
in
the
word
of
this
brown
forester
,
but
I
know
that
the
other
passenger
look
on
in
a
sort
of
admire
horror
,
and
that
presently
the
boat
be
put
back
to
the
wharf
,
and
as
many
of
the
Pioneers
as
could
be
coax
or
bully
into
go
away
,
be
get
rid
of
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
start
again
,
some
of
the
bold
spirit
on
board
,
make
bold
to
say
to
the
obvious
occasion
of
this
improvement
in
our
prospect
,
"
much
oblige
to
you
,
sir
;
"
whereunto
the
brown
forester
<EOS>
(
wave
his
hand
,
and
still
walk
up
and
down
as
before
)
,
reply
,
"
no
you

<EOS>
You
be
none

<EOS>
my
raising

<EOS>
You

act
for

you

<EOS>
I
have
pinte
out
the

.
 
<EOS>
down
Easters
and
Johnny
Cakes
can
follow
if
they

<EOS>

---
and
so
on
,
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
unanimously
vote
one
of
the
table
for
his
bed
at
night
---
there
be
a
great
contest
for
the
table
---
in
consideration
for
his
public
service
:
 
and
he
have
the
warm
corner
by
the
stove
throughout
the
rest
of
the
journey
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
never
could
find
out
that
he
do
anything
except
sit
there
;
nor
do
I
hear
him
speak
again
until
,
in
the
midst
of
the
bustle
and
turmoil
of
get
the
luggage
ashore
in
the
dark
at
Pittsburg
,
I
stumble
over
him
as
he
sit
smoke
a
cigar
on
the
cabin
step
,
and
hear
him
mutter
to
himself
,
with
a
short
laugh
of
defiance
,
"
I

<EOS>
I
an't
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
from
the
brown
forest
of
the
Mississippi
,
I
be
,
damme
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
inclined
to
argue
from
this
,
that
he
have
never
leave
off
say
so
;
but
I
could
not
make
an
affidavit
of
that
part
of
the
story
,
if
require
to
do
so
by
my
Queen
and
Country
.
   
<EOS>
as
we
have
not
reach
Pittsburg
yet
,
however
,
in
the
order
of
our
narrative
,
I
may
go
on
to
remark
that
breakfast
be
perhaps
the
least
desirable
meal
of
the
day
,
as
in
addition
to
the
many
savoury
odour
arise
from
the
eatable
already
mention
,
there
be
whiff
of
gin
,
whiskey
,
brandy
,
and
rum
,
from
the
little
bar
hard
by
,
and
a
decide
seasoning
of
stale
tobacco
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
the
gentleman
passenger
be
far
from
particular
in
respect
of
their
linen
,
which
be
in
some
case
as
yellow
as
the
little
rivulet
that
have
trickle
from
the
corner
of
their
mouth
in
chewing
,
and
dry
there
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
the
atmosphere
quite
free
from
zephyr
whispering
of
the
thirty
bed
which
have
just
be
clear
away
,
and
of
which
we
be
further
and
more
pressingly
remind
by
the
occasional
appearance
on
the
table
-
cloth
of
a
kind
of
game
,
not
mention
in
the
Bill
of
Fare
.
   
<EOS>
and
yet
despite
these
oddity
---
and
even
they
have
,
for
me
<EOS>
at
least
,
a
humour
of
their
own
---
there
be
much
in
this
mode
of
travel
which
I
heartily
enjoy
at
the
time
,
and
look
back
upon
with
great
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
even
the
run
up
,
bare
-
necked
,
at
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
from
the
taint
cabin
to
the
dirty
deck
;
scooping
up
the
icy
water
,
plunge
one
's
head
into
it
,
and
draw
it
out
,
all
fresh
and
glow
with
the
cold
;
be
a
good
thing
.
 
<EOS>
the
fast
,
brisk
walk
upon
the
towing
-
path
,
between
that
time
and
breakfast
,
when
every
vein
and
artery
seem
to
tingle
with
health
;
the
exquisite
beauty
of
the
opening
day
,
when
light
come
gleam
off
from
everything
;
the
lazy
motion
of
the
boat
,
when
one
lie
idly
on
the
deck
,
look
through
,
rather
than
at
,
the
deep
blue
sky
;
the
glide
on
at
night
,
so
noiselessly
,
past
frown
hill
,
sullen
with
dark
tree
,
and
sometimes
angry
in
one
red
,
burn
spot
high
up
,
where
unseen
man
lie
crouch
round
a
fire
;
the
shine
out
of
the
bright
star
undisturbed
by
noise
of
wheel
or
steam
,
or
any
other
sound
than
the
limpid
rippling
of
the
water
as
the
boat
go
on
:
 
all
these
be
pure
delight
.
   
<EOS>
then
there
be
new
settlement
and
detach
log
-
cabin
and
frame
-
house
,
full
of
interest
for
stranger
from
an
old
country
:
 
cabin
with
simple
oven
,
outside
,
make
of
clay
;
and
lodging
for
the
pig
nearly
as
good
as
many
of
the
human
quarter
;
break
window
,
patch
with
wear
-
out
hat
,
old
clothe
,
old
board
,
fragment
of
blanket
and
paper
;
and
home
-
make
dresser
stand
in
the
open
air
without
the
door
,
whereon
be
range
the
household
store
,
not
hard
to
count
,
of
earthen
jar
and
pot
.
 
<EOS>
the
eye
be
pain
to
see
the
stump
of
great
tree
thickly
strew
in
every
field
of
wheat
,
and
seldom
to
lose
the
eternal
swamp
and
dull
morass
,
with
hundred
of
rotten
trunk
and
twist
branch
steep
in
its
unwholesome
water
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
quite
sad
and
oppressive
,
to
come
upon
great
tract
where
settler
have
be
burn
down
the
tree
,
and
where
their
wounded
body
lie
about
,
like
those
of
murdered
creature
,
while
here
<EOS>
and
there
some
char
and
blacken
giant
rear
aloft
two
wither
arm
,
and
seem
to
call
down
curse
on
his
foe
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
at
night
,
the
way
wind
through
some
lonely
gorge
,
like
a
mountain
pass
in
Scotland
,
shine
and
coldly
glitter
in
the
light
of
the
moon
,
and
so
closed
in
by
high
steep
hill
all
round
,
that
there
seem
to
be
no
egress
save
through
the
narrow
path
by
which
we
have
come
,
until
one
rugged
hill
-
side
seem
to
open
,
and
shut
out
the
moonlight
as
we
pass
into
its
gloomy
throat
,
wrap
our
new
course
in
shade
and
darkness
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
leave
Harrisburg
on
Friday
.
 
<EOS>
on
Sunday
morning
we
arrive
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
,
which
be
cross
by
railroad
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
ten
inclined
plane
;
five
ascending
,
and
five
descending
;
the
carriage
be
drag
up
the
former
,
and
let
slowly
down
the
latter
,
by
mean
of
stationary
engine
;
the
comparatively
level
space
between
,
be
traverse
,
sometimes
by
horse
,
and
sometimes
by
engine
power
,
as
the
case
demand
.
 
<EOS>
occasionally
the
rail
be
lay
upon
the
extreme
verge
of
a
giddy
precipice
;
and
look
from
the
carriage
window
,
the
traveller
gaze
sheer
down
,
without
a
stone
or
scrap
of
fence
between
,
into
the
mountain
depth
below
.
<EOS>
the
journey
be
very
carefully
make
,
however
;
only
two
carriage
travel
together
;
and
while
proper
precaution
be
take
,
be
not
to
be
dread
for
its
danger
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
very
pretty
travel
thus
,
at
a
rapid
pace
along
the
height
of
the
mountain
in
a
keen
wind
,
to
look
down
into
a
valley
full
of
light
and
softness
;
catch
glimpse
,
through
the
tree
-
top
,
of
scatter
cabin
;
<EOS>
child
run
to
the
door
;
dog
burst
out
to
bark
,
whom
we
could
see
without
hear
:
 
terrified
pig
scamper
homeward
;
family
sit
out
in
their
rude
garden
;
cow
gaze
upward
with
a
stupid
indifference
;
man
in
their
shirt
-
sleeve
look
on
at
their
unfinished
house
,
plan
out
to
-
morrow
's
work
;
and
we
ride
onward
,
high
above
them
,
like
a
whirlwind
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
amusing
,
too
,
when
we
have
dine
,
and
rattle
down
a
steep
pass
,
have
no
other
move
power
than
the
weight
of
the
carriage
themselves
,
to
see
the
engine
release
,
long
after
us
,
come
buzz
down
alone
,
like
a
great
insect
,
its
back
of
green
and
gold
so
shine
in
the
sun
,
that
if
it
have
spread
a
pair
of
wing
and
soar
away
,
no
one
would
have
have
occasion
,
as
I
fancy
,
for
the
least
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
stop
short
of
us
in
a
very
business
-
like
manner
when
we
reach
the
canal
:
 
and
,
before
we
leave
the
wharf
,
go
pant
up
this
hill
again
,
with
the
passenger
who
have
wait
our
arrival
for
the
mean
of
traverse
the
road
by
which
we
have
come
.
   
<EOS>
on
the
Monday
evening
,
furnace
fire
and
clank
hammer
on
the
bank
of
the
canal
,
warn
us
that
we
approach
the
termination
of
this
part
of
our
journey
.
 
<EOS>
after
go
through
another
dreamy
place
---
a
long
aqueduct
across
the
Alleghany
River
,
which
be
strange
than
the
bridge
at
Harrisburg
,
be
a
vast
,
low
,
wooden
chamber
full
of
water
---
we
emerge
upon
that
ugly
confusion
of
back
of
building
and
crazy
gallery
and
stair
,
which
always
abut
on
water
,
whether
it
be
river
,
sea
,
canal
,
or
ditch
:
 
and
be
at
Pittsburg
.
   
<EOS>
Pittsburg
be
like
Birmingham
in
England
;
at
least
its
townspeople
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
set
aside
the
street
,
the
shop
,
the
house
,
waggon
,
factory
,
public
building
,
and
population
,
perhaps
it
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
It
certainly
have
a
great
quantity
of
smoke
hang
about
it
,
and
be
famous
for
its
iron
-
work
.
 
<EOS>
besides
the
prison
to
which
I
have
already
refer
,
this
town
contain
a
pretty
arsenal
and
other
institution
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
beautifully
situate
on
the
Alleghany
River
,
over
which
there
be
two
bridge
;
and
the
villas
of
the
wealthy
citizen
sprinkle
about
the
high
ground
in
the
neighbourhood
,
be
pretty
enough
.
 
<EOS>
We
lodge
at
a
most
excellent
hotel
,
and
be
admirably
serve
.
 
<EOS>
as
usual
it
be
full
of
boarder
,
be
very
large
,
and
have
a
broad
colonnade
to
every
story
of
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
We
tarry
here
three
day
.
 
<EOS>
Our
next
point
be
Cincinnati
:
 
and
as
this
be
a
steamboat
journey
,
and
western
steamboat
usually
blow
up
one
or
two
a
week
in
the
season
,
it
be
advisable
to
collect
opinion
in
reference
to
the
comparative
safety
of
the
vessel
bind
that
way
,
then
lie
in
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
one
call
the
Messenger
be
the
best
recommend
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
be
advertise
to
start
positively
,
every
day
for
a
fortnight
or
so
,
and
have
not
go
yet
,
nor
do
her
captain
seem
to
have
any
very
fix
intention
on
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
the
custom
:
 
for
if
the
law
be
to
bind
down
a
free
and
independent
citizen
to
keep
his
word
with
the
public
,
what
would
become
of
the
liberty
of
the
subject
?
 
<EOS>
besides
,
it
be
in
the
way
of
trade
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
passenger
be
decoy
in
the
way
of
trade
,
and
people
be
inconvenience
in
the
way
of
trade
,
what
man
,
who
be
a
sharp
tradesman
himself
,
shall
say
,
"
We
must
put
a
stop
to
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
impress
by
the
deep
solemnity
of
the
public
announcement
<EOS>
,
I
(
be
then
ignorant
of
these
usage
)
be
for
hurry
on
board
in
a
breathless
state
,
immediately
;
but
receive
private
and
confidential
information
that
the
boat
would
certainly
not
start
until
Friday
,
April
the
first
,
we
make
ourselves
very
comfortable
in
the
mean
while
,
and
go
on
board
at
noon
that
day
.

Chapter
11
.
<EOS>
from
Pittsburg
to
Cincinnati
in
a
Western
Steamboat
.
<EOS>
Cincinnati
 
<EOS>
the
Messenger
be
one
among
a
crowd
of
high
-
pressure
steamboat
,
cluster
together
by
a
wharf
-
side
,
which
,
look
down
upon
from
the
rise
ground
that
form
the
landing
-
place
,
and
back
by
the
lofty
bank
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
,
appear
no
large
than
so
many
float
model
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
some
forty
passenger
on
board
,
exclusive
of
the
poor
person
on
the
low
deck
;
and
in
half
an
hour
,
or
less
,
proceed
on
her
way
.
   
<EOS>
We
have
,
for
ourselves
,
a
tiny
state
-
room
with
two
berth
in
it
,
open
out
of
the
lady
'
cabin
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
,
undoubtedly
,
something
satisfactory
in
this
"
location
,
"
inasmuch
as
it
be
in
the
stern
,
and
we
have
be
a
great
many
time
very
gravely
recommend
to
keep
as
far
aft
as
possible
,
"
because
the
steamboat
generally
blow
up
forward
.
"
 
<EOS>
nor
be
this
an
unnecessary
caution
,
as
the
occurrence
and
circumstance
of
more
than
one
such
fatality
during
our
stay
sufficiently
testify
.
 
<EOS>
apart
from
this
source
of
self
-
congratulation
,
it
be
an
unspeakable
relief
to
have
any
place
,
no
matter
how
confine
,
where
one
could
be
alone
:
 
and
as
the
row
of
little
chamber
of
which
this
be
one
,
have
each
a
second
glass
-
door
besides
that
in
the
lady
'
cabin
,
which
open
on
a
narrow
gallery
outside
the
vessel
,
where
the
other
passenger
seldom
come
,
and
where
one
could
sit
in
peace
and
gaze
upon
the
shift
prospect
,
we
take
possession
of
our
new
quarter
with
much
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
if
the
native
packet
I
have
already
describe
be
unlike
anything
we
be
in
the
habit
of
see
on
water
,
these
western
vessel
be
still
more
foreign
to
all
the
idea
we
be
accustomed
to
entertain
of
boat
.
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
what
to
liken
them
to
,
or
how
to
describe
them
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
they
have
no
mast

they
anything

at
all
calculate
to
remind
one
of
a
boat
's
head
,
stem
,
side
,
or
keel
.
 
<EOS>
except
that
they
be
in
the
water

and
display
a
couple
of
paddle

box
,
they
may
be
intend
,
for
anything
that
appear
to
the
contrary
,
to
perform
some
unknown
service
,
high
and
dry
,
upon
a
mountain
top
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
visible
deck
,
even
:
 
nothing
but
a
long
,
black
,
ugly
roof
cover
with
burn
-
out
feathery
spark
;
above
which
tower
two
iron
chimney
,
and
a
hoarse
escape
valve
,
and
a
glass
steerage
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
in
order
as
the
eye
descend
towards
the
water
,
be
the
side
,
and
door
,
and
window
of
the
state

room
,
jumble
as
oddly
together
as
though
they
form
a
small
street
,
build
by
the
varying
taste
of
a
dozen
man
:
 
<EOS>
the
whole
be
support
on
beam
and
pillar
rest
on
a
dirty
barge
,
but
a
few
inch
above
the
water
's
edge
:
 
and
in
the
narrow
space
between
this
upper
structure
and
this
barge
's
deck
,
be
the
furnace
fire
and
machinery
,
open
at
the
side
to
every
wind
that
blow
,
and
every
storm
of
rain
it
drive
along
its
path
.
   
<EOS>
pass
one
of
these
boat
at
night
,
and
see
the
great
body
of
fire
,
expose
as
I
have
just
describe
,
that
rage
and
roar
beneath
the
frail
pile
of
paint
wood
:
 
the
machinery
,
not
ward
off
or
guard
in
any
way
,
but
do
its
work
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
of
idler
and
emigrant
and
child
,
who
throng
the
low
deck
:
 
under
the
management
,
too
,
of
reckless
man
whose
acquaintance
with
its
mystery
may
have
be
of
six
month
'
standing
:
 
<EOS>
one
feel
directly
that
the
wonder
be
,
not
that
there
should
be
so
many
fatal
accident
,
but
that
any
journey
should
be
safely
make
.
   
<EOS>
within
,
there
be
one
long
narrow
cabin
,
the
whole
length
of
the
boat
;
from
which
the
state
-
room
open
,
on
both
side
.
 
<EOS>
a
small
portion
of
it
at
the
stern
be
partition
off
for
the
lady
;
and
the
bar
be
at
the
opposite
extreme
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
long
table
down
the
centre
,
and
at
either
end
a
stove
.
 
<EOS>
the
washing
apparatus
be
forward
,
on
the
deck
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
little
well
than
on
board
the
canal
boat
,
but
not
much
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
mode
of
travelling
,
the
american
custom
,
with
reference
to
the
mean
of
personal
cleanliness
and
wholesome
ablution
,
be
extremely
negligent
and
filthy
;
and
I
strongly
incline
to
the
belief
that
a
considerable
amount
of
illness
be
referable
to
this
cause
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
to
be
on
board
the
Messenger
three
day
:
 
arrive
at
Cincinnati
(
bar
accident
)
on
Monday
morning
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
three
meal
a
day
.
 
<EOS>
Breakfast
at
seven
,
dinner
at
half
-
past
twelve
,
supper
about
six
.
 
<EOS>
at
each
,
there
be
a
great
many
small
dish
and
plate
upon
the
table
,
with
very
little
in
them
;
so
that
although
there
be
every
appearance
of
a
mighty
"
spread
,
"
there
be
seldom
really
more
than
a
joint
:
 
except
for
those
who
fancy
slice
of
beet
-
root
,
shred
of
dry
beef
,
complicated
entanglement
of
yellow
pickle
;
maize
,
indian
corn
,
apple
-
sauce
,
and
pumpkin
.
   
<EOS>
some
people
fancy
all
these
little
dainty
together
(
and
sweet
preserve
beside
)
,
by
way
of
relish
to
their
roast
pig
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
generally
those
dyspeptic
lady
and
gentleman
who
eat
unheard
-
of
quantity
of
hot
corn
bread
(
almost
as
good
for
the
digestion
as
a
knead
pin
-
cushion
)
,
for
breakfast
,
and
for
supper
.
 
<EOS>
those
who
do
not
observe
this
custom
,
and
who
help
themselves
several
time
instead
,
usually
suck
their
knife
and
fork
meditatively
,
until
they
have
decide
what
to
take
next
:
 
then
pull
them
out
of
their
mouth
:
 
put
them
in
the
dish
;
help
themselves
;
and
fall
to
work
again
.
 
<EOS>
at
dinner
,
there
be
nothing
to
drink
upon
the
table
,
but
great
jug
full
of
cold
water
.
 
<EOS>
nobody
say
anything
,
at
any
meal
,
to
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
passenger
be
very
dismal
,
and
seem
to
have
tremendous
secret
weigh
on
their
mind
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
conversation
,
no
laughter
,
no
cheerfulness
,
no
sociality
,
except
in
spitting
;
and
that
be
do
in
silent
fellowship
round
the
stove
,
when
the
meal
be
over
.
 
<EOS>
every
man
sit
down
,
dull
and
languid
;
swallow
his
fare
as
if
breakfast
,
dinner
,
and
supper
,
be
necessity
of
nature
never
to
be
couple
with
recreation
or
enjoyment
;
and
have
bolt
his
food
in
a
gloomy
silence
,
bolt
himself
,
in
the
same
state
.
 
<EOS>
but
for
these
animal
observance
,
you
may
suppose
the
whole
male
portion
of
the
company
to
be
the
melancholy
ghost
of
depart
book
-
keeper
,
who
have
fall
dead
at
the
desk
:
 
<EOS>
such
be
their
weary
air
of
business
and
calculation
.
<EOS>
undertaker
on
duty
would
be
sprightly
beside
them
;
and
a
collation
of
funeral
-
bake
meat
,
in
comparison
with
these
meal
,
would
be
a
sparkling
festivity
.
   
<EOS>
the
people
be
all
alike
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
diversity
of
character
.
<EOS>
They
travel
about
on
the
same
errand
,
say
and
do
the
same
thing
in
exactly
the
same
manner
,
and
follow
in
the
same
dull
cheerless
round
.
 
<EOS>
all
down
the
long
table
,
there
be
scarcely
a
man
who
be
in
anything
different
from
his
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
quite
a
relief
to
have
,
sit
opposite
,
that
little
girl
of
fifteen
with
the
loquacious
chin
:
 
who
,
to
do
her
justice
,
act
up
to
it
,
and
fully
identify
nature
's
handwriting
,
for
of
all
the
small
chatterbox
that
ever
invade
the
repose
of
drowsy
lady
'
cabin
,
she
be
the
first
and
foremost
.
 
<EOS>
the
beautiful
girl
,
who
sit
a
little
beyond
her
---
farther
down
the
table
there
---
marry
the
young
man
with
the
dark
whisker
,
who
sit
beyond
HER
,
only
last
month
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
go
to
settle
in
the
very
Far
West
,
where
he
have
live
four
year
,
but
where
she
have
never
be

<EOS>
They
be
both
overturn
in
a
stage
-
coach
the
other
day
(
a
bad
oman
anywhere
else
,
where
overturn
be
not
so
common
)
,
and
his
head
,
which
bear
the
mark
of
a
recent
wound
,
be
bind
up
still
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
hurt
too
,
at
the
same
time
,
and
lie
insensible
for
some
day
;
bright
as
her
eye
be
,
now
.
   
<EOS>
further
down
still
,
sit
a
man
who
be
go
some
mile
beyond
their
place
of
destination
,
to
"
improve
"
a
newly
-
discover
copper
mine
.
<EOS>
He
carry
the
village
---
that
be
to
be
---
with
him
:
 
a
few
frame
cottage
,
and
an
apparatus
for
smelt
the
copper
.
 
<EOS>
He
carry
its
people
too
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
partly
american
and
partly
irish
,
and
herd
together
on
the
low
deck
;
where
they
amuse
themselves
last
evening
till
the
night
be
pretty
far
advanced
,
by
alternately
fire
off
pistol
and
singe
hymn
.
   
<EOS>
They
,
and
the
very
few
who
have
be
leave
at
table
twenty
minute
,
rise
,
and
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
so
too
;
and
pass
through
our
little
state
-
room
,
resume
our
seat
in
the
quiet
gallery
without
.
   
<EOS>
a
fine
broad
river
always
,
<EOS>
but
in
some
part
much
wide
than
in
other
:
 
<EOS>
and
then
there
be
usually
a
green
island
,
cover
with
tree
,
divide
it
into
two
stream
.
 
<EOS>
occasionally
,
we
stop
for
a
few
minute
,
maybe
to
take
in
wood
,
maybe
for
passenger
,
at
some
small
town
or
village
<EOS>
(
I
ought
to
say
city
,
every
place
be
a
city
here
)
;
but
the
bank
be
for
the
most
part
deep
solitude
,
overgrow
with
tree
,
which
,
hereabout
,
be
already
in
leaf
and
very
green
.
 
<EOS>
for
mile
,
and
mile
,
and
mile
,
these
solitude
be
unbroken
by
any
sign
of
human
life
or
trace
of
human
footstep
;
nor
be
anything
see
to
move
about
them
but
the
blue
jay
,
whose
colour
be
so
bright
,
and
yet
so
delicate
,
that
it
look
like
a
flying
flower
.
 
<EOS>
at
lengthen
interval
<EOS>
a
log
cabin
,
with
its
little
space
of
clear
land
about
it
,
nestle
under
a
rise
ground
,
and
send
its
thread
of
blue
smoke
curl
up
into
the
sky
.
 
<EOS>
It
stand
in
the
corner
of
the
poor
field
of
wheat
,
which
be
full
of
great
unsightly
stump
,
like
earthy
butchers'-blocks
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
the
ground
be
only
just
now
clear
:
 
the
fell
tree
lie
yet
upon
the
soil
:
 
and
the
log
-
house
only
this
morning
begin
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
pass
this
clearing
,
the
settler
lean
upon
his
axe
or
hammer
,
and
look
wistfully
at
the
people
from
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
the
child
creep
out
of
the
temporary
hut
,
which
be
like
a
gipsy
tent
upon
the
ground
,
and
clap
their
hand
and
shout
.
 
<EOS>
the
dog
only
glance
round
at
us
,
and
then
look
up
into
his
master
's
face
again
,
as
if
he
be
render
uneasy
by
any
suspension
of
the
common
business
,
and
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
pleasurer
.
 
<EOS>
and
still
there
be
the
same
,
eternal
foreground
.
<EOS>
the
river
have
wash
away
its
bank
,
and
stately
tree
have
fall
down
into
the
stream
.
 
<EOS>
some
have
be
there
so
long
,
that
they
be
mere
dry
,
grizzly
skeleton
.
 
<EOS>
some
have
just
topple
over
,
and
have
earth
yet
about
their
root
,
be
bathe
their
green
head
in
the
river
,
and
put
forth
new
shoot
and
branch
.
 
<EOS>
some
be
almost
slide
down
,
as
you
look
at
them
.
 
<EOS>
and
some
be
drown
so
long
ago
,
that
their
bleach
arm
start
out
from
the
middle
of
the
current
,
and
seem
to
try
to
grasp
the
boat
,
and
drag
it
under
water
.
   
<EOS>
through
such
a
scene
as
this
,
the
unwieldy
machine
take
its
hoarse
,
sullen
way
:
 
venting
,
at
every
revolution
of
the
paddle
,
a
loud
high
-
pressure
blast
;
enough
,
one
would
think
,
to
waken
up
the
host
of
Indians
who
lie
bury
in
a
great
mound
yonder
:
 
<EOS>
so
old
,
that
mighty
oak
and
other
forest
tree
have
strike
their
root
into
its
earth
;
and
so
high
,
that
it
be
a
hill
,
even
among
the
hill
that
Nature
plant
round
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
river
,
as
though
it
share
one
's
feeling
of
compassion
for
the
extinct
tribe
who
live
so
pleasantly
here
,
in
their
bless
ignorance
of
white
existence
,
hundred
of
year
ago
,
steal
out
of
its
way
to
ripple
near
this
mound
:
 
and
there
be
few
place
where
the
Ohio
sparkle
more
brightly
than
in
the
Big
Grave
Creek
.
   
<EOS>
all
this
I
see
as
I
sit
in
the
little
stern

gallery
mention
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
evening
slowly
steal
upon
the
landscape
and
change
it
before
me
,
when
we
stop
to
set
some
emigrant
ashore
.
   
<EOS>
five
man
,
as
many
woman
,
and
a
little
girl
.
 
<EOS>
all
their
worldly
good
be
a
bag
,
a
large
chest
and
an
old
chair
:
 
one
,
old
,
high
-
backed
,
rush
-
bottom
chair
:
 
a
solitary
settler
in
itself
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
row
ashore
in
the
boat
,
while
the
vessel
stand
a
little
off
await
its
return
,
the
water
be
shallow
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
land
at
the
foot
of
a
high
bank
,
on
<EOS>
the
summit
of
which
be
a
few
log
cabin
,
attainable
only
by
a
long
winding
path
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
grow
dusk
;
but
the
sun
be
very
red
,
and
shine
in
the
water
and
on
some
of
the
tree
-
top
,
like
fire
.
   
<EOS>
the
man
get
out
of
the
boat
first
;
help
out
the
woman
;
take
out
the
bag
,
the
chest
,
the
chair
;
bid
the
rower
"
good
-
bye
;
"
and
shove
the
boat
off
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
first
plash
of
the
oar
in
the
water
,
the
old
woman
of
the
party
sit
down
in
the
old
chair
,
close
to
the
water
's
edge
,
without
speak
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
none
of
the
other
sit
down
,
though
the
chest
be
large
enough
for
many
seat
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
stand
where
they
land
,
as
if
stricken
into
stone
;
and
look
after
the
boat
.
 
<EOS>
so
they
remain
,
quite
still
and
silent
:
 
<EOS>
the
old
woman
and
her
old
chair
,
in
the
centre
the
bag
and
chest
upon
the
shore
,
without
anybody
heed
them
all
eye
fix
upon
the
boat
.
 
<EOS>
It
come
alongside
,
be
make
fast
,
the
man
jump
on
board
,
the
engine
be
put
in
motion
,
and
we
go
hoarsely
on
again
.
 
<EOS>
there
they
stand
yet
,
without
the
motion
of
a
hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
see
them
through
my
glass
,
when
,
in
the
distance
and
increase
darkness
,
they
be
mere
speck
to
the
eye
:
 
linger
there
still
:
 
the
old
woman
in
the
old
chair
,
and
all
the
rest
about
her
:
 
not
stir
in
the
least
degree
.
 
<EOS>
and
thus
I
slowly
lose
them
.
   
<EOS>
the
night
be
dark
,
and
we
proceed
within
the
shadow
of
the
wooded
bank
,
which
make
it
dark
.
 
<EOS>
after
glide
past
the
sombre
maze
of
bough
for
a
long
time
,
we
come
upon
an
open
space
where
the
tall
tree
be
burn
.
 
<EOS>
the
shape
of
every
branch
and
twig
be
express
in
a
deep
red
glow
,
and
as
the
light
wind
stir
and
ruffle
it
,
they
seem
to
vegetate
in
fire
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
such
a
sight
as
we
read
of
in
legend
of

to
think
how

must
come

the

will
rear
their

when

the

unborn

strike

the

<EOS>
midnight
and
sleep
blot
out
these
scene
and
thought
:
 
and
when
the

shine
again
,
it
gild
the
house
-
top
of
a
lively
city
,
before
whose
broad

the

be
moor
;
with
other

as

<EOS>
Cincinnati
be
a
beautiful
city
;
cheerful
,
thriving
,
and
animate
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
often
see
a
place
that
commend
itself
so
favourably
and
pleasantly
to
a
stranger
at
the
first
glance
as
this
do
:
with
its
clean
house
of
red
and
white
,
its
well
-
pave
road
,
and
foot
-
way
of
bright
tile
.
 
<EOS>
nor
do
it
become
less
prepossess
on
a
close
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
the
street
be
broad
and
airy
,
the
shop
extremely
good
,
the
private
residence
remarkable
for
their
elegance
and
neatness
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
something
of
invention
and
fancy
in
the
vary
style
of
these
latter
erection
,
which
,
after
the
dull
company
of
the
steamboat
,
be
perfectly
delightful
,
as
convey
an
assurance
that
there
be
such
quality
still
in
existence
.
 
<EOS>
the
disposition
to
ornament
these
pretty
villas
and
render
them
attractive
,
lead
to
the
culture
of
tree
and
flower
,
and
the
laying
out
of
well
-
keep
garden
,
the
sight
of
which
,
to
those
who
walk
along
the
street
,
be
inexpressibly
refreshing
and
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
quite
charm
with
the
appearance
of
the
town
,
and
its
adjoining
suburb
of
Mount
Auburn
:
 
from
which
the
city
,
lie
in
an
amphitheatre
of
hill
,
form
a
picture
of
remarkable
beauty
,
and
be
see
to
great
advantage
.
   
<EOS>
there
happen
to
be
a
great
Temperance
Convention
hold
here
on
the
day
after
our
arrival
;
and
as
the
order
of
march
bring
the
procession
under
the
window
of
the
hotel
in
which
we
lodge
,
when
they
start
in
the
morning
,
I
have
a
good
opportunity
of
see
it
.
<EOS>
It
comprise
several
thousand
man
;
the
member
of
various
"
Washington
Auxiliary
Temperance
Societies
;
"
and
be
marshal
by
officer
on
horseback
,
who
canter
briskly
up
and
down
the
line
,
with
scarf
and
ribbon
of
bright
colour
flutter
out
behind
them
gaily
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
band
of
music
too
,
and
banner
out
of
number
:
 
and
<EOS>
it
be
a
fresh
,
holiday
-
look
concourse
altogether
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
particularly
pleased
to
see
the
Irishmen
,
who
form
a
distinct
society
among
themselves
,
and
muster
very
strong
with
their
green
scarf
;
carry
their
national
harp
and
their
Portrait
of
Father
Mathew
,
high
above
the
people
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
They
look
as
jolly
and
good
-
humoured
as
ever
;
and
,
work
(
here
)
<EOS>
the
hard
for
their
living
and
do
any
kind
of
sturdy
labour
that
come
in
their
way
,
be
the
most
independent
fellow
there
,
I
think
.
   
<EOS>
the
banner
be
very
well
paint
,
and
flaunt
down
the
street
famously
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
smiting
of
the
rock
,
and
the
gushing
forth
of
the
water
;
and
there
be
a
temperate
man
with
"
considerable
of
a
hatchet
"
(
as
the
standard
-
bearer
would
probably
have
say
)
,
aim
a
deadly
blow
at
a
serpent
which
be
apparently
about
to
spring
upon
him
from
the
top
of
a
barrel
of
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
chief
feature
of
this
part
of
the
show
be
a
huge
allegorical
device
,
bear
among
the
ship
-
carpenter
<EOS>
,
on
one
side
whereof
the
steamboat
Alcohol
be
represent
burst
her
boiler
and
explode
with
a
great
crash

while
upon
the
other

the

away
with
a

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
be
prevent
from
get
there
,
in
time
to
hear
these
Little
Warblers
,
or
to
report
upon
this
novel
kind
of
vocal
entertainment
:
 
novel
,
at
least
,
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
find
in
a
large
open
space
,
each
society
gather
round
its
own
banner
,
and
listen
in
silent
attention
to
its
own
orator
.
 
<EOS>
the
speech
,
judge
from
the
little
I
could
hear
of
them
,
be
certainly
adapt
to
the
occasion
,
as
have
that
degree
of
relationship
to
cold
water
which
wet
blanket
may
claim
:
 
but
the
main
thing
be
the
conduct
and
appearance
of
the
audience
throughout
the
day
;
and
that
be
admirable
and
full
of
promise
.
   
<EOS>
Cincinnati
be
honourably
famous
for
its
free
school
,
of
which
it
have
so
many
that
no
person
's
child
among
its
population
can
,
by
possibility
,
want
the
mean
of
education
,
which
be
extend
,
upon
an
average
,
to
four
thousand
pupil
,
annually
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
only
present
in
one
of
these
establishment
during
the
hour
of
instruction
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
boy
'
department
,
which
be
full
of
little
urchin
(
varying
in
their
age
,
I
should
say
,
from
six
year
old
to
ten
or
twelve
)
,
the
master
offer
to
institute
an
extemporary
examination
of
the
pupil
in
algebra
;
a
proposal
,
which
,
as
I
be
by
no
mean
confident
of
my
ability
to
detect
mistake
in
that
science
,
I
decline
with
some
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
girl
'
school
,
reading
be
propose
;
and
as
I
feel
tolerably
equal
to
that
art
,
I
express
my
willingness
to
hear
a
class
.
 
<EOS>
book
be
distribute
accordingly
,
and
some
half
-
dozen
girl
relieve
each
other
in
read
paragraph
from
English
History
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
seem
to
be
a
dry
compilation
,
infinitely
above
their
power
;
and
when
they
have
blunder
through
three
or
four
dreary
passage
concern
the
Treaty
of
Amiens
,
and
other
thrill
topic
of
the
same
nature
(
obviously
without
comprehend
ten
word
)
,
I
express
myself
quite
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
possible
that
they
only
mount
to
this
exalt
stave
in
the
Ladder
of
learn
for
the
astonishment
of
a
visitor
;
and
that
at
other
time
they
keep
upon
its
low
round
;
but
I
should
have
be
much
better
please
and
satisfied
if
I
have
hear
them
exercise
in
simple
lesson
,
which
they
understand
.
   
<EOS>
as
in
every
other
place
I
visit
,
the
judge
here
be
gentleman
of
high
character
and
attainment
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
one
of
the
court
for
a
few
minute
,
and
find
it
like
those
to
which
I
have
already
refer
.
 
<EOS>
a
nuisance
cause
be
try
;
there
be
not
many
spectator
;
and
the
witness
,
counsel
,
and
jury
,
form
a
sort
of
family
circle
,
sufficiently
jocose
and
snug
.
   
<EOS>
the
society
with
which
I
mingle
,
be
intelligent
,
courteous
,
and
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
the
inhabitant
of
Cincinnati
be
proud
of
their
city
as
one
of
the
most
interesting
in
America
:
 
and
with
good
reason
:
for
beautiful
and
thriving
as
it
be
now

and
contain
,
as
it
do
,
a
population
of
fifty
thousand

but
two

fifty
year
have
pass
away
since
the

on
which
it
stand
(
buy
at
that

be
a

and

LEAVING
Cincinnati
at
eleven
o'clock
in
the
forenoon
,
we
embark
for
Louisville
in
the
Pike
steamboat
,
which
,
carry
the
mail
,
be
a
packet
of
a
much
well
class
than
that
in
which
we
have
come
from
Pittsburg
.
 
<EOS>
as
this
passage
do
not
occupy
more
than
twelve
or
thirteen
hour
,
we
arrange
to
go
ashore
that
night
:
 
not
covet
the
distinction
of
sleep
in
a
state
-
room
,
when
it
be
possible
to
sleep
anywhere
else
.
   
<EOS>
there
chance
to
be
on
board
this
boat
,
in
addition
to
the
usual
dreary
crowd
of
passenger
,
one
Pitchlynn
,
a
chief
of
the
Choctaw
tribe
of
Indians
,
who
send
in
his
card
to
me
,
and
with
whom
I
have
the
pleasure
of
a
long
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
He
speak
English
perfectly
well
,
though
he
have
not
begin
to
learn
the
language
,
he
tell
me
,
until
he
be
a
young
man
grow
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
read
many
book
;
and
Scott
's
poetry
appear
to
have
leave
a
strong
impression
on
his
mind
:
 
especially
the
opening
of
the
Lady
of
the
Lake
,
and
the
great
battle
scene
in
Marmion
,
in
which
,
no
doubt
from
the
congeniality
of
the
subject
to
his
own
pursuit
and
taste
,
he
have
great
interest
and
delight
.
 
<EOS>
He
appear
to
understand
correctly
all
he
have
read
;
and
whatever
fiction
have
enlist
his
sympathy
in
its
belief
,
have
do
so
keenly
and
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
almost
say
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
dress
in
our
ordinary
everyday
costume
,
which
hang
about
his
fine
figure
loosely
,
and
with
indifferent
grace
.
 
<EOS>
on
my
tell
him
that
I
regret
not
to
see
him
in
his
own
attire
,
he
throw
up
his
right
arm
,
for
a
moment
,
as
though
he
be
brandish
some
heavy
weapon
,
and
answer
,
as
he
let
it
fall
again
,
that
his
race
be
lose
many
thing
besides
their
dress
,
and
would
soon
be
see
upon
the
earth
no
more
:
 
but
he
wear
it
at
home
,
he
add
proudly
.
   
<EOS>
He
tell
me
that
he
have
be
away
from
his
home
,
west
of
the
Mississippi
,
seventeen
month
:
 
and
be
now
return
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
be
chiefly
at
Washington
on
some
negotiation
pende
between
his
Tribe
and
the
government
:
 
which
be
not
settle
yet
(
he
say
in
a
melancholy
way
)
,
and
he
fear
never
would
be
:
 
for
what
could
a
few
poor
Indians
do
,
against
such
well
-
skilled
man
of
business
as
the
white
?
 
<EOS>
He
have
no
love
for
Washington
;
tired
of
town
and
city
very
soon
;
and
long
for
the
Forest
and
the
Prairie
.
   
<EOS>
I
ask
him
what
he
think
of
Congress
?
 
<EOS>
He
answer
,
with
a
smile
,
that
it
want
dignity
,
in
an
Indian
's
eye
.
   
<EOS>
He
would
very
much
like
,
he
say
,
to
see
England
before
he
die
;
and
speak
with
much
interest
about
the
great
thing
to
be
see
there
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
tell
him
of
that
chamber
in
the
British
Museum
wherein
be
preserve
household
memorial
of
a
race
that
cease
to
be
,
<EOS>
thousand
of
year
ago
,
he
be
very
attentive
,
and
it
be
not
hard
to
see
that
he
have
a
reference
in
his
mind
to
the
gradual
fading
away
of
his
own
people
.
   
<EOS>
this
lead
us
to
speak
of
Mr
Catlin
's
gallery
,
which
he
praise
highly
:
 
<EOS>
observe
that
his
own
portrait
be
among
the
collection
,
and
that
all
the
likeness
be
"
elegant
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Cooper
,
he
say
,
have
paint
the
Red
Man
well
;
and
so
would
I
<EOS>
,
he
know
,
if
I
would
go
home
with
him
and
hunt
buffaloes
,
which
he
be
quite
anxious
I
should
do
.
 
<EOS>
when
I
tell
him
that
supposing
<EOS>
I
go
,
I
should
not
be
very
likely
to
damage
the
buffalo
much
,
he
take
it
as
a
great
joke
and
laugh
heartily
.
   
<EOS>
He
be
a
remarkably
handsome
man
;
some
year
past
forty
,
I
should
judge
;
with
long
black
hair
,
an
aquiline
nose
,
broad
cheek
-
bone
,
a
sunburnt
complexion
,
and
a
very
bright
,
keen
,
dark
,
and
pierce
eye
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
but
twenty
thousand
of
the
Choctaws
leave
,
he
say
,
and
their
number
be
decrease
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
a
few
of
his
brother
chief
have
be
oblige
to
become
civilised
,
and
to
make
themselves
acquaint
with
what
the
white
know
,
for
it
be
their
only
chance
of
existence
.
 
<EOS>
but
they
be
not
many
;
and
the
rest
be
as
they
always
have
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
dwell
on
this
:
 
and
say
several
time
that
unless
they
try
to
assimilate
themselves
to
their
conqueror
,
they
must
be
sweep
away
before
the
stride
of
civilised
society
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
shake
hand
at
parting
,
I
tell
him
he
must
come
to
England
,
as
he
long
to
see
the
land
so
much
:
 
that
I
should
hope
to
see
him
there
,
one
day
:
 
and
that
I
could
promise
him
he
would
be
well
receive
and
kindly
treat
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
evidently
please
by
this
assurance
,
though
he
rejoin
with
a
good
-
humoured
smile
and
an
arch
shake
of
his
head
,
that
the
English
use
to
be
very
fond
of
the
Red
Men
when
they
want
their
help
,
but
have
not
care
much
for
them
,
since
.
   
<EOS>
He
take
his
leave
;
as
stately
and
complete
a
gentleman
of
Nature
's
making
,
as
ever
I
beheld
;
and
move
among
the
people
in
the
boat
,
another
kind
of
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
send
me
a
lithographed
portrait
of
himself
soon
afterwards
;
very
like
,
though
scarcely
handsome
enough
;
which
I
have
carefully
preserve
in
memory
of
our
brief
acquaintance
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
very
interesting
in
the
scenery
of
this
day
's
journey
,
which
bring
us
at
midnight
to
Louisville
.
 
<EOS>
We
sleep
at
the
Galt
House
;
a
splendid
hotel
;
and
be
as
handsomely
lodge
as
though
we
have
be
in
Paris
,
rather
than
hundred
of
mile
beyond
the
Alleghanies
.
   
<EOS>
the
city
present
no
object
of
sufficient
interest
to
detain
us
on
our
way
,
we
resolve
to
proceed
next
day
by
another
steamboat
,
the
Fulton
,
and
to
join
it
,
about
noon
,
at
a
suburb
call
Portland
,
where
it
would
be
delay
some
time
in
pass
through
a
canal
.
   
<EOS>
the
interval
,
after
breakfast
,
we
devote
to
ride
through
the
town
,
which
be
regular
and
cheerful
:
 
<EOS>
the
street
be
lay
out
at
right
angle
,
and
plant
with
young
tree
.
 
<EOS>
the
building
be
smoky
and
blacken
,
from
the
use
of
bituminous
coal
,
but
an
Englishman
be
well
used
to
that
appearance
,
and
indispose
to
quarrel
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
there
do
not
appear
to
be
much
business
stir
;
and
some
unfinished
building
and
improvement
seem
to
intimate
that
the
city
have
be
overbuilt
in
the
ardour
of
"
go
-
a
-
head
,
"
and
be
suffer
under
the
re
-
action
consequent
upon
such
feverish
forcing
of
its
power
.
   
<EOS>
on
our
way
to
Portland
,
we
pass
a
"
Magistrate
's
office
,
"
which
amuse
me
,
as
look
far
more
like
a
dame
school
than
any
police
establishment
:
 
for
this
awful
Institution
be
nothing
but
a
little
lazy
,
good
-
for
-
nothing
front
parlour
,
open
to
the
street
;
wherein
two
or
three
figure
(
I
presume
the
magistrate
and
his
myrmidon
)
be
bask
in
the
sunshine
,
the
very
effigy
of
languor
and
repose
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
perfect
picture
of
justice
retire
from
business
for
want
of
customer
;
her
sword
and
scale
sell
off
;
nap
comfortably
with
her
leg
upon
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
here
,
as
elsewhere
in
these
part
,
the
road
be
perfectly
alive
with
pig
of
all
age
;
lie
about
in
every
direction
,
fast
asleep
.
;
or
grunt
along
in
quest
of
hidden
dainty
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
always
a
sneak
kindness
for
these
odd
animal
,
and
find
a
constant
source
of
amusement
,
when
all
other
fail
,
in
watch
their
proceeding
.
 
<EOS>
as
we
be
ride
along
this
morning
,
I
observe
a
little
incident
between
two
youthful
pig
,
which
be
so
very
human
as
to
be
inexpressibly
comical
and
grotesque
at
the
time
,
though
I
dare
say
,
in
tell
,
it
be
tame
enough
.
   
<EOS>
one
young
gentleman
(
a
very
delicate
porker
with
several
straws
stick
about
his
nose
,
betoken
recent
investigation
in
a
dung
-
hill
)
be
walk
deliberately
on
,
profoundly
think
,
when
suddenly
his
brother
,
who
be
lie
in
a
miry
hole
unseen
by
him
,
rise
up
immediately
before
his
startled
eye
,
ghostly
with
damp
mud
.
 
<EOS>
never
be
pig
's
whole
mass
of
blood
so
turn
.
 
<EOS>
He
start
back
at
least
three
foot
,
gaze
for
a
moment
,
and
then
shoot
off
as
hard
as
he
could
go
:
 
his
excessively
little
tail
vibrate
with
speed
and
terror
like
a
distracted
pendulum
.
 
<EOS>
but
before
he
have
go
very
far
,
he
begin
to
reason
with
himself
as
to
the
nature
of
this
frightful
appearance
;
and
as
he
reason
,
he
relax
his
speed
by
gradual
degree
;
until
at
last
he
stop
,
and
face
about
.
<EOS>
there
be
his
brother
,
with
the
mud
upon
him
glaze
in
the
sun
,
yet
stare
out
of
the
very
same
hole
,
perfectly
amazed
at
his
proceeding
!
 
<EOS>
He
be
no
sooner
assure
of
this
;
and
he
assure
himself
so
carefully
that
one
may
almost
say
he
shade
his
eye
with
his
hand
to
see
the
well
;
than
he
come
back
at
a
round
trot
,
pounce
upon
him
,
and
summarily
take
off
a
piece
of
his
tail
;
as
a
caution
to
him
to
be
careful
what
he
be
about
for
the
future
,
and
never
to
play
trick
with
his
family
any
more
.
   
<EOS>
We
find
the
steamboat
in
the
canal
,
wait
for
the
slow
process
of
get
through
the
lock
,
and
go
on
board
,
where
we
shortly
afterwards
have
a
new
kind
of
visitor
in
the
person
of
a
certain
Kentucky
Giant
whose
name
be
Porter
,
and
who
be
of
the
moderate
height
of
seven
foot
eight
inch
,
in
his
stocking
.
   
<EOS>
there
never
be
a
race
of
people
who
so
completely
give
the
lie
to
history
as
these
giant
,
or
whom
all
the
chronicler
have
so
cruelly
libel
.
 
<EOS>
instead
of
roar
and
ravage
about
the
world
,
constantly
cater
for
their
cannibal
larder
,
and
perpetually
go
to
market
in
an
unlawful
manner
,
they
be
the
meek
people
in
any
man
's
acquaintance
:
 
rather
incline
to
milk
and
vegetable
diet
,
and
bear
anything
for
a
quiet
life
.
 
<EOS>
so
decidedly
be
amiability
and
mildness
their
characteristic
,
<EOS>
that
I
confess
I
look
upon
that
youth
who
distinguish
himself
by
the
slaughter
of
these
inoffensive
person
,
as
a
false
-
hearted
brigand
,
who
,
pretend
to
philanthropic
motive
,
be
secretly
influence
only
by
the
wealth
store
up
within
their
castle
,
and
the
hope
of
plunder
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
lean
the
more
to
this
opinion
from
find
that
even
the
historian
of
those
exploit
,
with
all
his
partiality
for
his
hero
,
be
fain
to
admit
that
the
slaughter
monster
in
question
be
of
a
very
innocent
and
simple
turn
;
extremely
guileless
and
ready
of
belief
;
lend
a
credulous
ear
to
the
most
improbable
tale
;
suffer
themselves
to
be
easily
entrap
into
pit
;
and
even
(
as
in
the
case
of
the
Welsh
Giant
)
with
an
excess
of
the
hospitable
politeness
of
a
landlord
,
rip
themselves
open
,
rather
than
hint
at
the
possibility
of
their
guest
be
verse
in
the
vagabond
art
of
sleight
-
of
-
hand
and
hocus
-
pocus
.
   
<EOS>
the
Kentucky
Giant
be
but
another
illustration
of
the
truth
of
this
position
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
weakness
in
the
region
of
the
knee
,
and
a
trustfulness
in
his
long
face
,
which
appeal
even
to
five
-
foot
nine
for
encouragement
and
support
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
only
twenty
-
five
year
old
,
he
say
,
and
have
grow
recently
,
for
it
have
be
find
necessary
to
make
an
addition
to
the
leg
of
his
inexpressible
.
<EOS>
at
fifteen
he
be
a
short
boy
,
and
in
those
day
his
english
father
and
his
irish
mother
have
rather
snub
him
,
as
be
too
small
of
stature
to
sustain
the
credit
of
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
He
add
that
his
health
have
not
be
good
,
though
it
be
well
now
;
but
short
people
be
not
want
who
whisper
that
he
drink
too
hard
.
   
<EOS>
I
understand
he
drive
a
hackney
-
coach
,
though
how
he
do
it
,
unless
he
stand
on
the
footboard
behind
,
and
lie
along
the
roof
upon
his
chest
,
with
his
chin
in
the
box
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
comprehend
.
 
<EOS>
He
bring
his
gun
with
him
,
as
a
curiosity
.
   
<EOS>
christen
"
the
Little
Rifle
,
"
and
display
outside
a
shop
-
window
<EOS>
,
it
would
make
the
fortune
of
any
retail
business
in
Holborn
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
show
himself
and
talk
a
little
while
,
he
withdraw
with
his
pocket
-
instrument
,
and
go
bob
down
the
cabin
,
among
man
of
six
foot
high
and
upwards
,
like
a
light
-
house
walk
among
lamp
-
post
.
   
<EOS>
within
a
few
minute
afterwards
,
we
be
out
of
the
canal
,
and
in
the
Ohio
river
again
.
   
<EOS>
the
arrangement
of
the
boat
be
like
those
of
the
Messenger
,
and
the
passenger
be
of
the
same
order
of
people
.
 
<EOS>
We
feed
at
the
same
time
,
on
the
same
kind
of
viand
,
in
the
same
dull
manner
,
and
with
the
same
observance
.
 
<EOS>
the
company
appear
to
be
oppress
by
the
same
tremendous
concealment
,
and
have
as
little
capacity
of
enjoyment
or
light
-
heartedness
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
in
my
life
do
see
such
listless
,
heavy
dulness
as
brood
over
these
meal
:
 
the
very
recollection
of
it
weigh
me
down
,
and
make
me
,
for
the
moment
,
wretched
.
 
<EOS>
Reading
and
write
on
my
knee
,
in
our
little
cabin
,
I
really
dread
the
coming
of
the
hour
that
summon
us
to
table
;
and
be
as
glad
to
escape
from
it
again
,
as
if
it
have
be
a
penance
or
a
punishment
.
 
<EOS>
healthy
cheerfulness
and
good
spirit
form
a
part
of
the
banquet
<EOS>
,
I
could
soak
my
crust
in
the
fountain
with
Le
Sage
's
stroll
player
,
and
revel
in
their
glad
enjoyment
:
 
but
sit
down
with
so
many
fellow
-
animal
to
ward
off
thirst
and
hunger
as
a
business
;
to
empty
,
each
creature
,
his
Yahoo
's
trough
as
quickly
as
he
can
,
and
then
slink
sullenly
away
;
to
have
these
social
sacrament
strip
of
everything
but
the
mere
greedy
satisfaction
of
the
natural
craving
;
go
so
against
the
grain
with
me
,
that
I
seriously
believe
the
recollection
of
these
funeral
feast
will
be
a
wake
nightmare
to
me
all
my
life
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
some
relief
in
this
boat
,
too
,
which
there
have
not
be
in
the
other
,
for
the
captain
(
a
blunt
,
good

natured
fellow
)
<EOS>
have
his
handsome
wife
with
him
,
who
be
dispose
to
be
lively
and
agreeable
,
as
be
a
few
other
lady
-
passenger
who
have
their
seat
about
us
at
the
same
end
of
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
but
nothing
could
have
make
head
against
the
depressing
influence
of
the
general
body
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
magnetism
of
dulness
in
them
which
would
have
beat
down
the
most
facetious
companion
that
the
earth
ever
know
.
 
<EOS>
a
jest
would
have
be
a
crime
,
and
a
smile
would
have
fade
into
a
grin
horror
.
 
<EOS>
such
deadly
,
leaden
people
;
such
systematic
plodding
,
weary
,
insupportable
heaviness

such
a
mass
of
animated
indigestion
in
respect
of
all
that

the

Ohio

Mississippi
river

at
all

the

Hour

Hour

at

go
down
behind
the
bank
,
the
slight
blade
of
grass
upon
it
seem
to
become
as
distinctly
visible
as
the
artery
in
the
skeleton
of
a
leaf
;
and
when
,
as
it
slowly
sink
,
the
red
and
golden
bar
upon
the
water
grow
dimmer
,
and
dimmer
yet
,
as
if
they
be
sink
too
;
and
all
the
glow
colour
of
depart
day
pale
,
inch
by
inch
,
before
the
sombre
night
;
the
scene
become
a
thousand
time
more
lonesome
and
more
dreary
than
before
,
and
all
its
influence
darken
with
the
sky
.
   
<EOS>
We
drink
the
muddy
water
of
this
river
while
we
be
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
consider
wholesome
by
the
native
,
and
be
something
more
opaque
than
gruel
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
see
water
like
it
at
the
Filter
-
shop
,
but
nowhere
else
.
   
<EOS>
on
the
fourth
night
after
leave
Louisville
,
we
reach
St
Louis
,
and
here
I
witness
the
conclusion
of
an
incident
,
trifle
enough
in
itself
,
but
very
pleasant
to
see
,
which
have
interest
me
during
the
whole
journey
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
woman
on
board
,
with
a
little
baby
;
and
both
little
woman
and
little
child
be
cheerful
,
good
-
looking
,
bright
-
eyed
,
and
fair
to
see
.
 
<EOS>
the
little
woman
have
be
pass
a
long
time
with
her
sick
mother
in
New
York
,
and
have
leave
her
home
in
St
Louis
,
in
that
condition
in
which
lady
who
truly
love
their
lord
desire
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
the
baby
be
bear
in
her
mother
's
house
;
and
she
have
not
see
her
husband
(
to
whom
she
be
now
return
)
,
for
twelve
month
:
 
have
leave
him
a
month
or
two
after
their
marriage
.
   
<EOS>
well
,
to
be
sure
,
there
never
be
a
little
woman
so
full
of
hope
,
and
tenderness
,
and
love
,
and
anxiety
,
as
this
little
woman
be
:
and
all
day
long
she
wonder
whether
"
He
"
would
be
at
the
wharf
;
and
whether
"
He
"
have
get
her
letter
;
and
whether
,
if
she
send
the
baby
ashore
by
somebody
else
,
"
He
"
would
know
it
,
meet
it
in
the
street
:
 
which
,
see
that
he
have
never
set
eye
upon
it
in
his
life
,
be
not
very
likely
in
the
abstract
,
but
be
probable
enough
,
to
the
young
mother
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
such
an
artless
little
creature
;
and
be
in
such
a
sunny
,
beam
,
hopeful
state
;
and
let
out
all
this
matter
cling
close
about
her
heart
,
so
freely
;
that
all
the
other
lady
passenger
enter
into
the
spirit
of
it
as
much
as
she
;
and
the
captain
(
who
hear
all
about
it
from
his
wife
)
be
wondrous
sly
<EOS>
,
I
promise
you
:
 
inquire
,
every
time
we
meet
at
table
,
as
in
forgetfulness
,
whether
she
expect
anybody
to
meet
her
at
St
Louis
,
and
whether
she
would
want
to
go
ashore
the
night
we
reach
it
(
but
he
suppose
she
would
not
)
,
and
cut
many
other
dry
joke
of
that
nature
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
one
little
weazen
,
dry
-
apple
-
face
old
woman
,
who
take
occasion
to
doubt
the
constancy
of
husband
in
such
circumstance
of
bereavement
;
and
there
be
another
lady
(
with
a
lap
-
dog
)
old
enough
to
moralize
on
the
lightness
of
human
affection
,
and
yet
not
so
old
that
she
could
help
nurse
the
baby
,
now
and
then
,
or
laugh
with
the
rest
,
when
the
little
woman
call
it
by
its
father
's
name
,
and
ask
it
all
manner
of
fantastic
question
concern
him
in
the
joy
of
her
heart
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
something
of
a
blow
to
the
little
woman
,
that
when
we
be
within
twenty
mile
of
our
destination
,
it
become
clearly
necessary
to
put
this
baby
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
but
she
get
over
it
with
the
same
good
humour
;
tie
a
handkerchief
round
her
head
;
and
come
out
into
the
little
gallery
with
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
such
an
oracle
as
she
become
in
reference
to
the
locality
!
<EOS>
and
such
facetiousness
as
be
display
by
the
married
lady
!
<EOS>
and
such
sympathy
as
be
show
by
the
single
one
!
<EOS>
and
such
peal
of
laughter
as
the
little
woman
herself
(
who
would
just
as
soon
have
cry
)
greet
every
jest
with
!
   
<EOS>
at
last
,
there
be
the
light
of
St
Louis
,
and
here
be
the
wharf
,
and
those
be
the
step
:
 
and
the
little
woman
cover
her
face
with
her
hand
,
and
laughing
(
or
seem
to
laugh
)
more
than
ever
,
run
into
her
own
cabin
,
and
shut
herself
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
that
in
the
charming
inconsistency
of
such
excitement
,
she
stop
her
ear
,
lest
she
should
hear
"
Him
"
ask
for
her
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
see
her
do
it
.
   
<EOS>
then
,
a
great
crowd
of
people
rush
on
board
,
though
the
boat
be
not
yet
make
fast
,
but
be
wander
about
,
among
the
other
boat
,
to
find
a
landing
-
place
:
 
and
everybody
look
for
the
husband
:
and
nobody
see
him
:
 
<EOS>
when
,
in
the
midst
of
us
all
---
Heaven
know
how
she
ever
get
there
---
there
be
the
little
woman
cling
with
both
arm
<EOS>
tight
round
the
neck
of
a
fine
,
good
-
looking
,
sturdy
young
fellow
!
<EOS>
and
in
a
moment
afterwards
,
there
she
be
again
,
actually
clap
her
little
hand
for
joy
,
as
she
drag
him
through
the
small
door
of
her
small
cabin
,
to
look
at
the
baby
as
he
lie
asleep
!
   
<EOS>
We
go
to
a
large
hotel
,
call
the
Planter
's
House
:
 
build
like
an
english
hospital
,
with
long
passage
and
bare
wall
,
and
sky
-
light
above
the
room
-
door
for
the
free
circulation
of
air
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
many
boarder
in
it
;
and
as
many
light
sparkle
and
glisten
from
the
window
down
into
the
street
below
,
when
we
drive
up
,
as
if
it
have
be
illuminate
on
some
occasion
of
rejoice
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
excellent
house
,
and
the
proprietor
have
most
bountiful
notion
of
provide
the
creature
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
dine
alone
with
my
wife
in
our
own
room
,
one
day
,
I
count
fourteen
dish
on
the
table
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
old
french
portion
of
the
town
,
the
thoroughfare
be
narrow
and
crooked
,
and
some
of
the
house
be
very
quaint
and
picturesque
:
 
be
build
of
wood
,
with
tumble
-
down
gallery
before
the
window
,
approachable
by
stair
or
rather
ladder
from
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
queer
little
barber
'
shop
and
drinking
-
house
too
,
in
this
quarter
;
and
abundance
of
crazy
old
tenement
with
blink
casement
,
such
as
may
be
see
in
flander
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
these
ancient
habitation
,
with
high
garret
gable
-
window
perk
into
the
roof
,
have
a
kind
of
french
shrug
about
them
;
and
be
lop
-
sided
with
age
,
appear
to
hold
their
head
askew
,
besides
,
as
if
they
be
grimace
in
astonishment
at
the
American
Improvements
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
hardly
necessary
to
say
,
that
these
consist
of
wharf
and
warehouse
,
and
new
building
in
all
direction
;
and
of
a
great
many
vast
plan
which
be
still
"
progress
.
"
 
<EOS>
already
,
however
,
some
very
good
house
,
broad
street
,
and
marble
-
front
shop
,
have
go
so
far
ahead
as
to
be
in
a
state
of
completion
;
and
the
town
bid
fair
in
a
few
year
to
improve
considerably
:
 
though
it
be
not
likely
ever
to
vie
,
in
point
of
elegance
or
beauty
,
with
Cincinnati
.
   
<EOS>
the
roman
catholic
religion
,
introduce
here
by
the
early
french
settler
,
prevail
extensively
.
 
<EOS>
among
the
public
institution
be
a
Jesuit
college
;
a
convent
for
"
the
Ladies
of
the
Sacred
Heart
;
"
and
a
large
chapel
attach
to
the
college
,
which
be
in
course
of
erection
at
the
time
of
my
visit
,
and
be
intend
to
be
consecrate
on
the
second
of
December
in
the
next
year
.
 
<EOS>
the
architect
of
this
building
,
be
one
of
the
reverend
father
of
the
school
,
and
the
work
proceed
under
his
sole
direction
.
 
<EOS>
the
organ
will
be
send
from
Belgium
.
   
<EOS>
in
addition
to
these
establishment
,
there
be
a
roman
catholic
cathedral
,
dedicated
to
Saint
Francis
Xavier
;
and
a
hospital
,
found
by
the
munificence
of
a
deceased
resident
,
who
be
a
member
of
that
church
.
 
<EOS>
It
also
send
missionary
from
hence
among
the
indian
tribe
.
   
<EOS>
the
unitarian
church
be
represent
,
in
this
remote
place
,
as
in
most
other
part
of
America
,
by
a
gentleman
of
great
worth
and
excellence
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
have
good
reason
to
remember
and
bless
it
;
for
it
befriend
them
,
and
aid
the
cause
of
rational
education
,
without
any
sectarian
or
selfish
view
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
liberal
in
all
its
action
;
of
kind
construction
;
and
of
wide
benevolence
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
three
free
-
school
already
erect
,
and
in
full
operation
in
this
city
.
 
<EOS>
a
fourth
be
build
,
and
will
soon
be
open
.
   
<EOS>
no
man
ever
admit
the
unhealthiness
of
the
place
he
dwell
in
(
unless
he
be
go
away
from
it
)
,
and
I
shall
therefore
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
be
at
issue
with
the
inhabitant
of
St
Louis
,
in
question
the
perfect
salubrity
of
its
climate
,
and
in
hint
that
I
think
it
must
rather
dispose
to
fever
,
in
the
summer
and
autumnal
season
.
 
<EOS>
just
add
,
that
it
be
very
hot
,
lie
among
great
river
,
and
have
vast
tract
of
undrained
swampy
land
around
it
,
I
leave
the
reader
to
form
his
own
opinion
.
   
<EOS>
as
I
have
a
great
desire
to
see
a
Prairie
before
turn
back
from
the
furth
point
of
my
wandering
;
and
as
some
gentleman
of
the
town
have
,
in
their
hospitable
consideration
,
an
equal
desire
to
gratify
me
;
a
day
be
fix
,
before
my
departure
,
for
an
expedition
to
the
Looking
-
Glass
Prairie
,
which
be
within
thirty
mile
of
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
deem
it
possible
that
my
reader
may
not
object
to
know
what
kind
of
thing
such
a
gipsy
party
may
be
at
that
distance
from
home
,
and
among
what
sort
of
object
it
move
,
I
will
describe
the
jaunt
in
another
chapter
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
13
.
<EOS>
a
Jaunt
to
the
Looking
-
Glass
Prairie
and
Back
 
<EOS>
I
MAY
premise
that
the
word
Prairie
be
variously
pronounce
PARAAER
,
PAREARER
,
PAROARER
.
 
<EOS>
the
latter
mode
of
pronunciation
be
perhaps
the
most
in
favour
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
fourteen
in
all
,
and
all
young
man
:
 
<EOS>
indeed
it
be
a
singular
though
very
natural
feature
in
the
society
of
these
distant
settlement
,
that
it
be
mainly
compose
of
adventurous
person
in
the
prime
of
life
,
and
have
very
few
grey
head
among
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
lady
:
 
<EOS>
the
trip
be
a
fatiguing
one
:
 
<EOS>
and
we
be
to
start
at
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
punctually
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
call
at
four
,
that
I
may
be
certain
of
keep
nobody
wait
;
and
have
get
some
bread
and
milk
for
breakfast
,
throw
up
the
window
and
look
down
into
the
street
,
expect
to
see
the
whole
party
busily
astir
,
and
<EOS>
great
preparation
go
on
below
.
<EOS>
but
as
everything
be
very
quiet
,
and
the
street
present
that
hopeless
aspect
with
which
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
be
familiar
elsewhere
,
I
deem
it
as
well
to
go
to
bed
again
,
and
go
accordingly
.
   
<EOS>
I
wake
again
at
seven
o'clock
,
and
by
that
time
the
party
have
assemble
,
and
be
gather
round
,
one
light
carriage
,
with
a
very
stout
axletree
;
one
something
on
wheel
like
an
amateur
carrier
's
cart
;
one
double
phaeton
of
great
antiquity
and
unearthly
construction
;
one
gig
with
a
great
hole
in
its
back
and
a
broken
head
;
and
one
rider
on
horseback
who
be
to
go
on
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
into
the
first
coach
with
three
companion
;
the
rest
bestow
themselves
in
the
other
vehicle
;
two
large
basket
be
make
fast
to
the
light
;
two
large
stone
jar
in
wicker
case
,
technically
know
as
demi
-
johns
,
be
consign
to
the
"
least
rowdy
"
of
the
party
for
safe
-
keeping
;
and
the
procession
move
off
to
the
ferryboat
,
in
which
it
be
to
cross
the
river
bodily
,
man
,
horse
,
carriage
,
and
all
,
as
the
manner
in
these
part
be
.
   
<EOS>
We
get
over
the
river
in
due
course
,
and
muster
again
before
a
little
wooden
box
on
wheel
,
hove
down
all
aslant
in
a
morass
,
with
"
MERCHANT
TAILOR
"
paint
in
very
large
letter
over
the
door
.
<EOS>
have
settle
the
order
of
proceeding
,
and
the
road
to
be
take
,
we
start
off
once
more
and
begin
to
make
our
way
through
an
ill
-
favour
Black
Hollow
,
call
,
less
expressively
,
the
American
Bottom
.
   
<EOS>
the
previous
day
have
be
---
not
to
say
hot
,
for
the
term
be
weak
and
lukewarm
in
its
power
of
convey
an
idea
of
the
temperature
.
<EOS>
the
town
have
be
on
fire
;
in
a
blaze
.
 
<EOS>
but
at
night
it
have
come
on
to
rain
in
torrent
,
and
all
night
long
it
have
rain
without
cessation
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
a
pair
of
very
strong
horse
,
but
travel
at
the
rate
of
little
more
than
a
couple
of
mile
an
hour
,
through
one
unbroken
slough
of
black
mud
and
water
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
no
variety
but
in
depth
.
 
<EOS>
now
it
be
only
half
over
the
wheel
,
now
it
hide
the
axletree
,
and
now
the
coach
sink
down
in
it
almost
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
the
air
resound
in
all
direction
with
the
loud
chirping
of
the
frog
,
who
,
with
the
pig
(
a
coarse
,
ugly
breed
,
as
unwholesome
-
look
as
though
they
be
the
spontaneous
growth
of
the
country
)
,
have
the
whole
scene
to
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
here
<EOS>
and
there
we
pass
a
log
hut
:

we

He

stray

I

I
make
bold
to
peep
in

<EOS>
It

unfurnished

comfortless
room

with
an
unframed

be
Dr.

<EOS>
a
crowd
have
flock
in
from

voice
from
among

call
out
to

<EOS>
upon
which
Doctor
Crocus
,
who
be
a
tall

fine

look
Scotchman
,
but
rather
fierce
and
warlike
in
appearance
for
a
professor
of
the
peaceful
art

,
burst
out
of
the
concourse
with
his
right

extend
,
and
his

throw
out
as
far
as
it
will
possibly
come

and
say
:
   
"
<EOS>
Your
countryman

<EOS>
Whereupon
Doctor
Crocus
<EOS>
and
I
shake
hand
;
and
Doctor
Crocus
look
as
if
I
do
not
by
any
mean
realise
his
expectation
,
which
,
in
a
linen
blouse
,
and
a
great
straw
hat
,
with
a
green
ribbon
,
and
no
glove
,
and
my
face

nose
profusely
ornament
with
the

"

I.
   
<EOS>
"
three

the

<EOS>
"
do
you
think
of
soon
return
to
the
old
country
?
"
say
I.
   
Doctor
Crocus
make
no
verbal
answer
,
but
give
me
an
imploring
look
,
which
say
so
plainly
"
Will
you
ask
me
that
again
,
a
little
louder
,
if
you
please
?
"
that
I
repeat
the
question
.
   
<EOS>
"
think
of
soon
return

"
<EOS>
repeat
the
Doctor
.
   
<EOS>
"
to
the
old
country

"
I
rejoin
.
   
<EOS>
Doctor
Crocus
look
round
upon
the
crowd
to
observe
the
effect
he
produce
,
rub
his
hand
,
and
say
,
in
a
very
loud
voice
:
   
"
not
yet
awhile

sir

not

<EOS>
You
will
not
catch
me

<EOS>
I
be
a

too
fond

freedom
for

<EOS>
ha

<EOS>
It
be

tear
himself

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
no

no

"
   
<EOS>
as
Doctor
Crocus
say
these
latter
word
,
he
shake
his
head
,
knowingly
,
and
laugh
again
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
the
bystander
shake
their
head
in
concert
with
the
doctor
,
and
laugh
too
,
and
look
at
each
other
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
a
pretty
bright
and
first

rate
sort
of
chap
be
Crocus
!
"
<EOS>
and
unless
I
be
very
much
mistaken
,
a
good
many
people
go
to
the
lecture
that
night
,
who
never
think
about
phrenology
,
or
about
Doctor
Crocus
either
,
in
all
their
life
before
.
   
<EOS>
from
Belleville
,
we
go
on
,
through
the
same
desolate
kind
of
waste
,
and
constantly
attend
,
without
the
interval
of
a
moment
,
by
the
same
music
;
until
,
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
we
halt
once
more
at
a
village
call
Lebanon
to
inflate
the
horse
again
,
and
give
them
some
corn
besides
:
 
of
which
they
stand
much
in
need
.
 
<EOS>
pende
this
ceremony
,
I
walk
into
the
village
,
where
I
meet
a
full
-
sized
dwelling
-
house
come
down
-
hill
at
a
round
trot
,
draw
by
a
score
or
more
of
oxen
.
   
<EOS>
the
public
-
house
be
so
very
clean
and
good
<EOS>
a
one
,
that
the
manager
of
the
jaunt
resolve
to
return
to
it
and
put
up
there
for
the
night
,
if
possible
.
 
<EOS>
this
course
decide
on
,
and
the
horse
be
well
refresh
,
we
again
push
forward
,
and
come
upon
the
Prairie
at
sunset
.
   
<EOS>
It
would
be
difficult
to
say
why
,
or
how
---
though
it
be
possibly
from
have
hear
and
read
so
much
about
it
---
but
the
effect
on
me
be
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
look
towards
the
set
sun
,
there
lie
,
stretch
out
before
my
view
,
a
vast
expanse
of
level
ground
;
unbroken
,
save
by
one
thin
line
of
tree
,
which
scarcely
amount
to
a
scratch
upon
the
great
blank
;
until
it
meet
the
glowing
sky
,
wherein
it
seem
to
dip
:
 
<EOS>
mingle
with
its
rich
colour
,
and
mellowing
in
its
distant
blue
.
 
<EOS>
there
it
lie
,
a
tranquil
sea
or
lake
without
water
,
if
such
a
simile
be
admissible
,
with
the
day
go
down
upon
it
:
 
a
few
bird
wheel
here
and
there
:
 
and
solitude
and
silence
reign
paramount
around
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
grass
be
not
yet
high
;
there
be
bare
black
patch
on
the
ground
;
and
the
few
wild
flower
that
the
eye
could
see
,
be
poor
and
scanty
.
<EOS>
great
as
the
picture
be
,
its
very
flatness
and
extent
,
which
leave
nothing
to
the
imagination
,
tame
it
down
and
cramp
its
interest
.
<EOS>
I
feel
little
of
that
sense
of
freedom
and
exhilaration
which
a
scottish
heath
inspire
,
or
even
our
english
down
awaken
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
lonely
and
wild
,
but
oppressive
in
its
barren
monotony
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
that
in
traverse
the
Prairies
,
I
could
never
abandon
myself
to
the
scene
,
forgetful
of
all
else
;
as
I
should
do
instinctively
,
be
the
heather
underneath
my
foot
,
or
an
iron
-
bind
coast
beyond
;
but
should
often
glance
towards
the
distant
and
frequently
-
recede
line
of
the
horizon
,
and
wish
it
gain
and
pass
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
a
scene
to
be
forget
,
but
it
be
scarcely
one
,
I
think
(
at
all
event
,
as
I
see
it
)
,
to
remember
with
much
pleasure
,
or
to
covet
the
looking
-
on
again
,
in
after
-
life
.
   
<EOS>
We
encamp
near
a
solitary
log
-
house
,
for
the
sake
of
its
water
,
and
dine
upon
the
plain
.
 
<EOS>
the
basket
contain
roast
fowl
,
buffalo
's
tongue
(
an
exquisite
dainty
,
by
the
way
)
,
ham
,
bread
,
cheese
,
and
butter
;
biscuit
,
champagne
,
sherry
;
lemon
and
sugar
for
punch
;
and
abundance
of
rough
ice
.
 
<EOS>
the
meal
be
delicious
,
and
the
entertainer
be
the
soul
of
kindness
and
good
humour
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
recall
that
cheerful
party
to
my
pleasant
recollection
since
,
and
shall
not
easily
forget
,
in
junketings
nearer
home
with
friend
of
old
date
,
my
boon
companion
on
the
Prairie
.
   
<EOS>
return
to
Lebanon
that
night
,
we
lie
at
the
little
inn
at
which
we
have
halt
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
in
point
of
cleanliness
and
comfort
it
would
have
suffer
by
no
comparison
with
any
english
alehouse
,
of
a
homely
kind
,
in
England
.
   
<EOS>
rise
at
five
o'clock
next
morning
,
I
take
a
walk
about
the
village
:
 
none
of
the
house
be
stroll
about
to
-
day
,
but
it
be
early
for
them
yet
,
perhaps
:
 
and
then
amuse
myself
by
lounge
in
a
kind
of
farm
-
yard
behind
the
tavern
,
of
which
the
lead
feature
be
,
a
strange
jumble
of
rough
shed
for
stable
;
a
rude
colonnade
,
build
as
a
cool
place
of
summer
resort
;
a
deep
well
;
a
great
earthen
mound
for
keep
vegetable
in
,
in
winter
time
;
and
a
pigeon
-
house
,
whose
little
aperture
look
,
as
they
do
in
all
pigeon
-
house
,
very
much
too
small
for
the
admission
of
the
plump
and
swelling
-
breast
bird
who
be
strut
about
it
,
though
they
try
to
get
in
never
so
hard
.
 
<EOS>
that
interest
exhaust
<EOS>
,
I
take
a
survey
of
the
inn
's
two
parlour
,
which
be
decorate
with
coloured
print
of
Washington
,
and
President
Madison
,
and
of
a
white
-
faced
young
lady
(
much
speckle
by
the
fly
)
,
who
hold
up
her
gold
neck
-
chain
for
the
admiration
of
the
spectator
,
and
inform
all
admire
comer
that
she
be
"
just
seventeen
:
"
although
I
should
have
think
her
old
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
good
room
be
two
oil
portrait
of
the
kit
-
cat
size
,
represent
the
landlord
and
his
infant
son
;
both
look
as
bold
as
lion
,
and
stare
out
of
the
canvas
with
an
intensity
that
would
have
be
cheap
at
any
price
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
paint
,
I
think
,
by
the
artist
who
have
touch
up
the
Belleville
door
with
red
and
gold
;
for
I
seem
to
recognise
his
style
immediately
.
   
<EOS>
after
breakfast
,
we
start
to
return
by
a
different
way
from
that
which
we
have
take
yesterday
,
and
come
up
at
ten
o'clock
with
an
encampment
of
german
emigrant
carry
their
good
in
cart
,
who
have
make
a
rousing
fire
which
they
be
just
quit
,
stop
there
to
refresh
.
 
<EOS>
and
very
pleasant
the
fire
be
;
for
,
hot
though
it
have
be
yesterday
,
it
be
quite
cold
to
-
day
,
and
the
wind
blow
keenly
.
 
<EOS>
loom
in
the
distance
,
as
we
ride
along
,
be
another
of
the
ancient
indian
burial
-
place
,
call
the
Monks
'
Mound
;
in
memory
of
a
body
of
fanatic
of
the
order
of
La
Trappe
,
who
found
a
desolate
convent
there
,
many
year
ago
,
when
there
be
no
settler
within
a
thousand
mile
,
and
be
all
sweep
off
by
the
pernicious
climate
:
 
in
which
lamentable
fatality
,
few
rational
people
will
suppose
,
perhaps
,
that
society
experience
any
very
severe
deprivation
.
   
<EOS>
the
track
of
to
-
day
have
the
same
feature
as
the
track
of
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
swamp
,
the
bush
,
and
the
perpetual
chorus
of
frog
,
the
rank
unseemly
growth
,
the
unwholesome
steam
earth
.
<EOS>
here
and
there
,
and
frequently
too
,
we
encounter
a
solitary
break
-
down
waggon
,
full
of
some
new
settler
's
good
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
pitiful
sight
to
see
one
of
these
vehicle
deep
in
the
mire
;
the
axle
-
tree
break
;
the
wheel
lie
idly
by
its
side
;
the
man
go
mile
away
,
to
look
for
assistance
;
the
woman
seat
among
their
wander
household
god
with
a
baby
at
her
breast
,
a
picture
of
forlorn
,
dejected
patience
;
the
team
of
oxen
crouch
down
mournfully
in
the
mud
,
and
breathe
forth
such
cloud
of
vapour
from
their
mouth
and
nostril
,
that
all
the
damp
mist
and
fog
around
seem
to
have
come
direct
from
them
.
   
<EOS>
in
due
time
we
muster
once
again
before
the
merchant
tailor
's
,
and
have
do
so
,
cross
over
to
the
city
in
the
ferry
-
boat
:
pass
,
on
the
way
,
a
spot
call
Bloody
Island
,
the
duelling
-
ground
of
St
Louis
,
and
so
designate
in
honour
of
the
last
fatal
combat
fight
there
,
which
be
with
pistol
,
breast
to
breast
.
<EOS>
both
combatant
fall
dead
upon
the
ground
;
and
possibly
some
rational
people
may
think
of
them
,
as
of
the
gloomy
madman
on
the
Monks
'
Mound
,
that
they
be
no
great
loss
to
the
community

return
to
Cincinnati
.
 
<EOS>
a
Stage

Coach
Ride
from
that
city
to
Columbus
,
and
Thence
to
Sandusky
.
<EOS>
so
,
by
Lake
Erie
,
to
the
Falls
of
Niagara
 
<EOS>
as
<EOS>
I
have
a
desire
to
travel
through
the
interior
of
the
state
of
Ohio
,
and
to
"
strike
the
lake
,
"
as
the
phrase
be
,
at
a
small
town
call
Sandusky
,
to
which
that
route
would
conduct
us
on
our
way
to
Niagara
<EOS>
,
we
have
to
return
from
St
Louis
by
the
way
we
have
come
,
and
to
retrace
our
former
track
as
far
as
Cincinnati
.
   
<EOS>
the
day
on
which
we
be
to
take
leave
of
St
Louis
be
very
fine
;
and
the
steamboat
,
which
be
to
have
start
I
do
not
know
how
early
in
the
morning
,
postponing
,
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
,
her
departure
until
the
afternoon
;
we
ride
forward
to
an
old
french
village
on
the
river
,
call
properly
Carondelet
,
and
nickname
Vide
Poche
,
and
arrange
that
the
packet
should
call
for
us
there
.
   
<EOS>
the
place
consist
of
a
few
poor
cottage
,
and
two
or
three
public
-
house
;
the
state
of
whose
larder
certainly
seem
to
justify
the
second
designation
of
the
village
,
for
there
be
nothing
to
eat
in
any
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
however
,
by
go
back
some
half
a
mile
or
so
,
we
find
a
solitary
house
where
ham
and
coffee
be
procurable
;
and
there
we
tarry
to
wait
the
advent
of
the
boat
,
which
would
come
in
sight
from
the
green
before
the
door
,
a
long
way
off
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
neat
,
unpretende
village
tavern
,
and
we
take
our
repast
in
a
quaint
little
room
with
a
bed
in
it
,
decorate
with
some
old
oil
painting
,
which
in
their
time
have
probably
do
duty
in
a
catholic
chapel
or
monastery
.
 
<EOS>
the
fare
be
very
good
,
and
serve
with
great
cleanliness
.
 
<EOS>
the
house
be
keep
by
a
characteristic
old
couple
,
with
whom
we
have
a
long
talk
,
and
who
be
perhaps
a
very
good
sample
of
that
kind
of
people
in
the
West
.
   
<EOS>
the
landlord
be
a
dry
,
tough
,
hard
-
face
old
fellow
(
not
so
very
old
either
,
for
he
be
but
just
turn
sixty
,
I
should
think
)
,
who
have
be
out
with
the
militia
in
the
last
war
with
England
,
and
have
see
all
kind
of
service
,
---
except
a
battle
;
and
he
have
be
very
near
see
that
,
he
add
:
 
very
near
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
all
his
life
be
restless
and
locomotive
,
with
an
irresistible
desire
for
change
;
and
be
still
the
son
of
his
old
self
:
 
for
if
he
have
nothing
to
keep
him
at
home
,
he
say
(
slightly
jerk
his
hat
and
his
thumb
towards
the
window
of
the
room
in
which
the
old
lady
sit
,
as
we
stand
talk
in
front
of
the
house
)
,
he
would
clean
up
his
musket
,
and
be
off
to
Texas
to
-
morrow
morning
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
the
very
many
descendant
of
Cain
proper
to
this
continent
,
who
seem
destine
from
their
birth
to
serve
as
pioneer
in
the
great
human
army
:
 
who
gladly
go
on
from
year
to
year
extend
its
outpost
,
and
leave
home
after
home
behind
them
;
and
die
at
last
,
utterly
regardless
of
their
grave
be
leave
thousand
of
mile
behind
,
by
the
wander
generation
who
succeed
.
   
<EOS>
His
wife
be
a
domesticated
,
kind
-
hearted
old
soul
,
who
have
come
with
him
,
"
from
the
queen
city
of
the
world
,
"
which
,
it
seem
,
be
Philadelphia
;
but
have
no
love
for
this
western
country
,
and
indeed
have
little
reason
to
bear
it
any
;
have
see
her
child
,
one
by
one
,
die
here
of
fever
,
in
the
full
prime
and
beauty
of
their
youth
.
 
<EOS>
Her
heart
be
sore
,
she
say
,
to
think
of
them
;
and
to
talk
on
this
theme
,
even
to
stranger
,
in
that
blighted
place
,
so
far
from
her
old
home
,
ease
it
somewhat
,
and
become
a
melancholy
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
the
boat
appear
towards
evening
,
we
bade
adieu
to
the
poor
old
lady
and
her
vagrant
spouse
,
and
make
for
the
near
landing
-
place
,
be
soon
on
board
the
Messenger
again
,
in
our
old
cabin
,
and
steam
down
the
Mississippi
.
   
<EOS>
if
the
come
up
this
river
,
slowly
make
head
against
the
stream
,
be
an
irksome
journey
,
the
shooting
down
it
with
the
turbid
current
be
almost
bad
;
for
then
the
boat
,
proceed
at
the
rate
of
twelve
or
fifteen
mile
an
hour
,
have
to
force
its
passage
through
a
labyrinth
of
float
log
,
which
,
in
the
dark
,
it
be
often
impossible
to
see
beforehand
or
avoid
.
 
<EOS>
all
that
night
,
the
bell
be
never
silent
for
five
minute
at
a
time
;
and
after
every
ring
the
vessel
reel
again
,
sometimes
beneath
a
single
blow
,
sometimes
beneath
a
dozen
deal
in
quick
succession
,
the
light
of
which
seem
more
than
enough
to
beat
in
her
frail
keel
,
as
though
it
have
be
pie
-
crust
.
 
<EOS>
look
down
upon
the
filthy
river
after
dark
,
it
seem
to
be
alive
with
monster
,
as
these
black
masse
roll
upon
the
surface
,
or
come
start
up
again
,
head
first
,
when
the
boat
,
in
plough
her
way
among
a
shoal
of
such
obstruction
,
drive
a
few
among
them
for
the
moment
under
water
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
the
engine
stop
during
a
long
interval
,
and
then
before
her
and
behind
,
and
gather
close
about
her
on
all
side
,
be
so
many
of
these
ill
-
favour
obstacle
that
she
be
fairly
hem
in
;
the
centre
of
a
float
island
;
and
be
constrain
to
pause
until
they
part
,
somewhere
,
as
dark
cloud
will
do
before
the
wind
,
and
open
by
degree
a
channel
out
.
   
<EOS>
in
good
time
next
morning
,
however
,
we
come
again
in
sight
of
the
detestable
morass
call
Cairo
;
and
stop
there
to
take
in
wood
,
lie
alongside
a
barge
,
whose
start
timber
scarcely
hold
together
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
moor
to
the
bank
,
and
on
its
side
be
paint
"
Coffee
House
;
"
that
being
,
I
suppose
,
the
float
paradise
to
which
the
people
fly
for
shelter
when
they
lose
their
house
for
a
month
or
two
beneath
the
hideous
water
of
the
Mississippi
.
 
<EOS>
but
look
southward
from
this
point
,
we
have
the
satisfaction
of
see
that
intolerable
river
drag
its
slimy
length
and
ugly
freight
abruptly
off
towards
New
Orleans
;
and
pass
a
yellow
line
which
stretch
across
the
current
,
be
again
upon
the
clear
Ohio
,
never
,
I
trust
,
to
see
the
Mississippi
more
,
save
in
troubled
dream
and
nightmare
.
 
<EOS>
leave
it
for
the
company
of
its
sparkling
neighbour
,
be
like
the
transition
from
pain
to
ease
,
or
the
awakening
from
a
horrible
vision
to
cheerful
reality
.
   
<EOS>
We
arrive
at
Louisville
on
the
fourth
night
,
and
gladly
avail
ourselves
of
its
excellent
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
next
day
we
go
on
in
the
Ben
Franklin
,
a
beautiful
mail
steamboat
,
and
reach
Cincinnati
shortly
after
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
be
by
this
time
nearly
tired
of
sleep
upon
shelf
,
we
have
remain
awake
to
go
ashore
straightway
;
and
grope
a
passage
across
the
dark
deck
of
other
boat
,
and
among
labyrinth
of
engine
-
machinery
and
leak
cask
of
molasse
,
we
reach
the
street
,
knock
up
the
porter
at
the
hotel
where
we
have
stay
before
,
and
be
,
to
our
great
joy
,
safely
house
soon
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
We
rest
but
one
day
at
Cincinnati
,
and
then
resume
our
journey
to
Sandusky
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
comprise
two
variety
of
stage
-
coach
travelling
,
which
,
with
those
I
have
already
glance
at
,
comprehend
the
main
characteristic
of
this
mode
of
transit
in
America
,
I
will
take
the
reader
as
our
fellow
-
passenger
,
and
pledge
myself
to
perform
the
distance
with
all
possible
despatch
.
   
<EOS>
Our
place
of
destination
in
the
first
instance
be
Columbus
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
distant
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
mile
from
Cincinnati
,
but
there
be
a
macadamised
road
(
rare
blessing
!
)
<EOS>
the
whole
way
,
and
the
rate
of
travel
upon
it
be
six
mile
an
hour
.
   
<EOS>
We
start
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
in
a
great
mail
-
coach
,
whose
huge
cheek
be
so
very
ruddy
and
plethoric
,
that
it
appear
to
be
trouble
with
a
tendency
of
blood
to
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
dropsical
it
certainly
be
,
for
it
will
hold
a
dozen
passenger
inside
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
wonderful
to
add
,
it
be
very
clean
and
bright
,
be
nearly
new
;
and
rattle
through
the
street
of
Cincinnati
gaily
.
   
<EOS>
Our
way
lie
through
a
beautiful
country
,
richly
cultivate
,
and
luxuriant
in
its
promise
of
an
abundant
harvest
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
we
pass
a
field
where
the
strong
bristling
stalk
of
indian
corn
look
like
a
crop
of
walking
-
stick
,
and
sometimes
an
enclosure
where
the
green
wheat
be
spring
up
among
a
labyrinth
of
stump
;
the
primitive
worm
-
fence
be
universal
,
and
an
ugly
thing
it
be
;
but
the
farm
be
neatly
keep
,
and
,
save
for
these
difference
,
one
may
be
travel
just
now
in
Kent
.
   
<EOS>
We
often
stop
to
water
at
a
roadside
inn
,
which
be
always
dull
and
silent
.
 
<EOS>
the
coachman
dismount
and
fill
his
bucket
,
and
hold
it
to
the
horse
'
head
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
scarcely
ever
any
one
to
help
him
;
there
be
seldom
any
lounger
stand
round
;
and
never
any
stable
-
company
with
joke
to
crack
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
when
we
have
change
our
team
,
there
be
a
difficulty
in
start
again
,
arise
out
of
the
prevalent
mode
of
break
a
young
horse
:
 
which
be
to
catch
him
,
harness
him
against
his
will
,
and
put
him
in
a
stage
-
coach
without
further
notice
:
 
<EOS>
but
we
get
on
somehow
or
other
,
after
a
great
many
kick
and
a
violent
struggle
;
and
jog
on
as
before
again
.
   
<EOS>
occasionally
,
when
we
stop
to
change
,
some
two
or
three
half
-
drunken
loafer
will
come
loiter
out
with
their
hand
in
their
pocket
,
or
will
be
see
kick
their
heel
in
rock
-
chair
,
or
lounge
on
the
window
-
sill
,
or
sit
on
a
rail
within
the
colonnade
:
 
they
have
not
often
anything
to
say
though
,
either
to
us
or
to
each
other
,
but
sit
there
idly
stare
at
the
coach
and
horse
.
 
<EOS>
the
landlord
of
the
inn
be
usually
among
them
,
and
seem
,
of
all
the
party
,
to
be
the
least
connected
with
the
business
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
he
be
with
reference
to
the
tavern
,
what
the
driver
be
in
relation
to
the
coach
and
passenger
:
 
<EOS>
whatever
happen
in
his
sphere
of
action
,
he
be
quite
indifferent
,
and
perfectly
easy
in
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
the
frequent
change
of
coachman
work
no
change
or
variety
in
the
coachman
's
character
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
always
dirty
,
sullen
,
and
taciturn
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
capable
of
smartness
of
any
kind
,
moral
or
physical
,
he
have
a
faculty
of
conceal
it
which
be
truly
marvellous
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
speak
to
you
as
you
sit
beside
him
on
the
box
,
and
if
you
speak
to
him
,
he
answer
(
if
at
all
)
in
monosyllable
.
 
<EOS>
He
point
out
nothing
on
the
road
,
and
seldom
look
at
anything
:
 
<EOS>
be
,
to
all
appearance
,
thoroughly
weary
of
it
and
of
existence
generally
.
 
<EOS>
as
to
do
the
honour
of
his
coach
,
his
business
,
as
I
have
say
,
be
with
the
horse
.
 
<EOS>
the
coach
follow
because
it
be
attach
to
them
and
go
on
wheel
:
 
not
because
you
be
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
towards
the
end
of
a
long
stage
,
he
suddenly
break
out
into
a
discordant
fragment
of
an
election
song
,
but
his
face
never
sing
along
with
him
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
only
his
voice
,
and
not
often
that
.
   
<EOS>
He
always
chew
and
always
spit
,
and
never
encumber
himself
with
a
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
the
consequence
to
the
box
passenger
,
especially
when
the
wind
blow
towards
him
,
be
not
agreeable
.
   
<EOS>
whenever
the
coach
stop
,
and
you
can
hear
the
voice
of
the
inside
passenger
;
or
whenever
any
bystander
address
them
,
or
any
one
among
them
;
or
they
address
each
other
;
you
will
hear
one
phrase
repeat
over
and
over
and
over
again
to
the
most
extraordinary
extent
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
ordinary
and
unpromising
phrase
enough
,
be
neither
more
nor
less
than
"
yes
,
sir
;
"
but
it
be
adapt
to
every
variety
of
circumstance
,
and
fill
up
every
pause
in
the
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
thus
:
---
the
time
be
one
o'clock
at
noon
.
 
<EOS>
the
scene
,
a
place
where
we
be
to
stay
and
dine
,
on
this
journey
.
 
<EOS>
the
coach
drive
up
to
the
door
of
an
inn
.
 
<EOS>
the
day
be
warm
,
and
there
be
several
idler
linger
about
the
tavern
,
and
wait
for
the
public
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
among
them
,
be
a
stout
gentleman
in
a
brown
hat
,
swinge
himself
to
and
fro
in
a
rocking
-
chair
on
the
pavement
.
   
<EOS>
as
the
coach
stop
,
a
gentleman
in
a
straw
hat
look
out
of
the
window
:
  
straw

the

I
reckon
that
be

it

<EOS>
BROWN

swinge
;
speak
very
slowly

without

yes

<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
a

.
 
<EOS>
They
look
at
each

,
very
seriously
.
  
<EOS>
straw

.
 
<EOS>
I
calculate
you
will
have
get
through
that
case
of
the

by
this

now

<EOS>
another
pause
.
 
<EOS>
They
look
at

still
more
seriously
than
before

<EOS>
BROWN

this

be
rather
behind
its

<EOS>
yes

nigh
upon

his

great

<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
BROWN

,
as
he
put
up
his

)
 
<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
all
the
other
inside

)
 
<EOS>
yes

<EOS>
coachman.(in
a
very
surly

)
 
<EOS>
no
it
an't
.
   
<EOS>
STRAW
HAT.(To
the
coachman
.
)
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
do
not
know
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
a
pretty
tall
time
come
that
last
fifteen
mile
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
fact
.
    
<EOS>
the
coachman
make
no
reply
,
and
plainly
decline
to
enter
into
any
controversy
on
a
subject
so
far
remove
from
his
sympathy
and
feeling
,
another
passenger
say
,
"
yes
,
sir
;
"
and
the
gentleman
in
the
straw
hat
in
acknowledgment
of
his
courtesy
,
say
"
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
,
"
to
him
,
in
return
.
 
<EOS>
the
straw
hat
then
inquire
of
the
brown
hat
,
whether
that
coach
in
which
he
(
the
straw
hat
)
then
sit
,
be
not
a
new
one
?
 
<EOS>
to
which
the
brown
hat
again
make
answer
,
"
yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
straw
HAT
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
so
.
 
<EOS>
pretty
loud
smell
of
varnish
,
sir
?
   
<EOS>
BROWN
HAT
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
.
   
<EOS>
all
the
other
inside
passenger
.
 
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
.
   
<EOS>
BROWN
HAT.(To
the
company
in
general
.
)
 
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
.
    
<EOS>
the
conversational
power
of
the
company
have
be
by
this
time
pretty
heavily
tax
,
the
straw
hat
open
the
door
and
get
out
;
and
<EOS>
all
the
rest
alight
also
.
 
<EOS>
We
dine
soon
afterwards
with
the
boarder
in
the
house
,
and
have
nothing
to
drink
but
tea
and
coffee
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
be
both
very
bad
and
the
water
be
bad
,
I
ask
for
brandy
;
but
it
be
a
Temperance
hotel
,
and
spirit
be
not
to
be
have
for
love
or
money
.
 
<EOS>
this
preposterous
forcing
of
unpleasant
drink
down
the
reluctant
throat
of
traveller
be
not
at
all
uncommon
in
America
,
but
I
never
discover
that
the
scruple
of
such
wincing
landlord
induce
them
to
preserve
any
unusually
nice
balance
between
the
quality
of
their
fare
,
and
their
scale
of
charge
:
 
on
the
contrary
,
I
rather
suspect
them
of
diminish
the
one
and
exalt
the
other
,
by
way
of
recompense
for
the
loss
of
their
profit
on
the
sale
of
spirituous
liquor
.
 
<EOS>
after
all
,
perhaps
,
the
plain
course
for
person
of
such
tender
conscience
,
would
be
,
a
total
abstinence
from
tavern
-
keeping
.
   
<EOS>
dinner
over
,
we
get
into
another
vehicle
which
be
ready
at
the
door
(
for
the
coach
have
be
change
in
the
interval
)
,
and
resume
our
journey
;
which
continue
through
the
same
kind
of
country
until
evening
,
when
we
come
to
the
town
where
we
be
to
stop
for
tea
and
supper
;
and
have
deliver
the
mail
bag
at
the
Post
-
office
,
ride
through
the
usual
wide
street
,
line
with
the
usual
store
and
house
(
the
draper
always
have
hang
up
at
their
door
,
by
way
of
sign
,
a
piece
of
bright
red
cloth
)
,
to
the
hotel
where
this
meal
be
prepare
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
many
boarder
here
,
we
sit
down
,
a
large
party
,
and
a
very
melancholy
one
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
buxom
hostess
at
the
head
of
the
table
,
and
<EOS>
opposite
,
a
simple
Welsh
schoolmaster
with
his
wife
and
child
;
who
come
here
,
on
a
speculation
of
great
promise
than
performance
,
to
teach
the
classic
:
 
and
they
be
sufficient
subject
of
interest
until
the
meal
be
over
,
and
another
coach
be
ready
.
 
<EOS>
in
it
we
go
on
once
more
,
light
by
a
bright
moon
,
until
midnight
;
when
we
stop
to
change
the
coach
again
,
and
remain
for
half
an
hour
or
so
in
a
miserable
room
,
with
a
blurred
lithograph
of
Washington
over
the
smoky
fire
-
place
,
and
a
mighty
jug
of
cold
water
on
the
table
:
 
to
which
refreshment
<EOS>
the
moody
passenger
do
so
apply
themselves
that
they
would
seem
to
be
,
one
and
all
,
keen
patient
of
Dr.
Sangrado
.
<EOS>
among
them
be
a
very
little
boy
,
who
chew
tobacco
like
a
very
big
one
;
and
a
droning
gentleman
,
who
talk
arithmetically
and
statistically
on
all
subject
,
from
poetry
downward
;
and
who
always
speak
in
the
same
key
,
with
exactly
the
same
emphasis
,
and
with
very
grave
deliberation
.
 
<EOS>
He
come
outside
just
now
,
and
tell
me
how
that
the
uncle
of
a
certain
young
lady
who
have
be
spirit
away
and
marry
by
a
certain
captain
,
live
in
these
part
;
and
how
this
uncle
be
so
valiant
and
ferocious
that
he
should
not
wonder
if
he
be
to
follow
the
say
captain
to
England
,
"
and
shoot
him
down
in
the
street
wherever
he
find
him
;
"
in
the
feasibility
of
which
strong
measure
<EOS>
I
,
be
for
the
moment
rather
prone
to
contradiction
,
from
feel
half
asleep
and
very
tired
,
decline
to
acquiesce
:
 
assure
him
that
if
the
uncle
do
resort
to
it
,
or
gratify
any
other
little
whim
of
the
like
nature
,
he
would
find
himself
one
morning
prematurely
throttle
at
the
Old
Bailey
:
 
and
that
he
would
do
well
to
make
his
will
before
he
go
,
as
he
would
certainly
want
it
before
he
have
be
in
Britain
very
long
.
   
<EOS>
on
we
go
,
all
night
,
and
by
-
and
-
by
the
day
begin
to
break
,
and
presently
the
first
cheerful
ray
of
the
warm
sun
come
slant
on
us
brightly
.
 
<EOS>
It
shed
its
light
upon
a
miserable
waste
of
sodden
grass
,
and
dull
tree
,
and
squalid
hut
,
whose
aspect
be
forlorn
and
grievous
in
the
last
degree
.
 
<EOS>
a
very
desert
in
the
wood
,
<EOS>
whose
growth
of
green
be
dank
and
noxious
like
that
upon
the
top
of
standing
water
:
 
where
poisonous
fungus
grow
in
the
rare
footprint
on
the
oozy
ground
,
and
sprout
like
witch
'
coral
,
from
the
crevice
in
the
cabin
wall
and
floor
;
it
be
a
hideous
thing
to
lie
upon
the
very
threshold
of
a
city
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
purchase
year
ago
,
and
as
the
owner
can
not
be
discover
,
the
state
have
be
unable
to
reclaim
it
.
 
<EOS>
so
there
it
remain
,
in
the
midst
of
cultivation
and
improvement
,
like
ground
accurse
,
and
make
obscene
and
rank
by
some
great
crime
.
   
<EOS>
We
reach
Columbus
shortly
before
seven
o'clock
,
and
stay
there
,
to
refresh
,
that
day
and
night
:
 
have
excellent
apartment
in
a
very
large
unfinished
hotel
call
the
Neill
House
,
which
be
richly
fit
with
the
polished
wood
of
the
black
walnut
,
and
open
on
a
handsome
portico
and
stone
verandah
,
like
room
in
some
italian
mansion
.
 
<EOS>
the
town
be
clean
and
pretty
,
and
of
course
be
"
go
to
be
"
much
large
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
the
seat
of
the
state
legislature
of
Ohio
,
and
lay
claim
,
in
consequence
,
to
some
consideration
and
importance
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
no
stage
-
coach
next
day
,
upon
the
road
we
wish
to
take
,
I
hire
"
an
extra
,
"
at
a
reasonable
charge
to
carry
us
to
Tiffin
;
a
small
town
from
whence
<EOS>
there
be
a
railroad
to
Sandusky
.
<EOS>
this
extra
be
an
ordinary
four
-
horse
stage
-
coach
,
such
as
I
have
describe
,
change
horse
and
driver
,
as
the
stage
-
coach
would
,
but
be
exclusively
our
own
for
the
journey
.
 
<EOS>
to
ensure
our
have
horse
at
the
proper
station
,
and
be
incommode
by
no
stranger
,
the
proprietor
send
an
agent
on
the
box
,
who
be
to
accompany
us
the
whole
way
through
;
and
thus
attend
,
and
bear
with
us
,
besides
,
a
hamper
full
of
savoury
cold
meat
,
and
fruit
,
and
wine
,
we
start
off
again
in
high
spirit
,
at
half
-
past
six
o'clock
next
morning
,
very
much
delighted
to
be
by
ourselves
,
and
dispose
to
enjoy
even
the
rough
journey
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
well
for
us
,
that
we
be
in
this
humour
,
for
the
road
we
go
over
that
day
,
be
certainly
enough
to
have
shake
temper
that
be
not
resolutely
at
Set
Fair
,
down
to
some
inch
below
Stormy
.
 
<EOS>
at
one
time
we
be
all
flung
together
in
a
heap
at
the
bottom
of
the
coach
,
and
at
another
we
be
crush
our
head
against
the
roof
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
one
side
be
down
deep
in
the
mire
,
and
we
be
hold
on
to

<EOS>
now
,
the
coach
be
lie
on
the
tail
of
the
two
wheeler
;
and
now
it
be
rear
up
in
the
air
,
in
a
frantic
state
,
with
all
four
horse
stand
on
the
top
of
an
insurmountable
eminence
,
look
coolly
back
at
it
,
as
though
they
would
say
"
unharness
us
.
 
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
do
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
driver
on
these
road
,
who
certainly
get
over
the
ground
in
a
manner
which
be
quite
miraculous
,
so
twist
and
turn
the
team
about
in
force
a
passage
,
corkscrew
fashion
,
through
the
bog
and
swamp
,
that
it
be
quite
a
common
circumstance
on
look
out
of
the
window
,
to
see
the
coachman
with
the
end
of
a
pair
of
rein
in
his
hand
,
apparently
drive
nothing
,
or
play
at
horse
,
and
<EOS>
the
leader
stare
at
one
unexpectedly
from
the
back
of
the
coach
,
as
if
they
have
some
idea
of
get
up
behind
.
 
<EOS>
a
great
portion
of
the
way
be
over
what
be
call
a
corduroy
road
,
which
be
make
by
throw
trunk
of
tree
into
a
marsh
,
and
leave
them
to
settle
there
.
 
<EOS>
the
very
slight
of
the
jolt
with
which
the
ponderous
carriage
fall
from
log
to
log
,
be
enough
,
it
seem
,
to
have
dislocate
all
the
bone
in
the
human
body
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
impossible
to
experience
a
similar
set
of
sensation
,
in
any
other
circumstance
,
unless
perhaps
in
attempt
to
go
up
to
the
top
of
St
Paul
's
in
an
omnibus
.
 
<EOS>
never
,
never
once
,
that
day
,
be
the
coach
in
any
position
,
attitude
,
or
kind
of
motion
to
which
we
be
accustomed
in
coach
.
 
<EOS>
never
do
it
make
the
small
approach
to
one
's
experience
of
the
proceeding
of
any
sort
of
vehicle
that
go
on
wheel
.
   
<EOS>
still
,
it
be
a
fine
day
,
and
the
temperature
be
delicious
,
and
though
we
have
leave
Summer
behind
us
in
the
west
,
and
be
fast
leave
Spring
,
we
be
move
towards
Niagara
and
home
.
 
<EOS>
We
alight
in
a
pleasant
wood
towards
the
middle
of
the
day
,
dine
on
a
fall
tree
,
and
leave
our
good
fragment
with
a
cottager
,
and
our
bad
with
the
pig
(
who
swarm
in
this
part
of
the
country
like
grain
of
sand
on
the
sea
-
shore
,
to
the
great
comfort
of
our
commissariat
in
Canada
)
<EOS>
,
we
go
forward
again
,
gaily
.
   
<EOS>
as
night
come
on
,
the
track
grow
narrow
and
narrower
,
until
at
last
it
so
lose
itself
among
the
tree
,
that
the
driver
seem
to
find
his
way
by
instinct
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
the
comfort
of
knowing
,
at
least
,
that
there
be
no
danger
of
his
fall
asleep
,
for
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
wheel
would
strike
against
an
unseen
stump
with
such
a
jerk
,
that
he
be
fain
to
hold
on
pretty
tight
and
pretty
quick
,
to
keep
himself
upon
the
box
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
there
any
reason
to
dread
the
least
danger
from
furious
driving
,
inasmuch
as
over
that
break
grind
the
horse
have
enough
to
do
to
walk
;
<EOS>
as
to
shy
,
there
be
no
room
for
that
;
and
a
herd
of
wild
elephant
could
not
have
run
away
in
such
a
wood
,
with
such
a
coach
at
their
heel
.
 
<EOS>
so
we
stumble
along
,
quite
satisfied
.
   
<EOS>
these
stump
of
tree
be
a
curious
feature
in
american
travelling
.
<EOS>
the
vary
illusion
they
present
to
the
unaccustomed
eye
as
it
grow
dark
,
be
quite
astonishing
in
their
number
and
reality
.
<EOS>
now
,
there
be
a
grecian
urn
erect
in
the
centre
of
a
lonely
field
;
now
there
be
a
woman
weep
at
a
tomb
;
now
a
very
commonplace
old
gentleman
in
a
white
waistcoat
,
with
a
thumb
thrust
into
each
arm
-
hole
of
his
coat
;
now
a
student
pore
on
a
book
;
now
a
crouching
negro
;
now
,
a
horse
,
a
dog
,
a
cannon
,
an
armed
man
;
a
hunch
-
back
throw
off
his
cloak
and
step
forth
into
the
light
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
often
as
entertain
to
me
as
so
many
glass
in
a
magic
lantern
,
and
never
take
their
shape
at
my
bidding
,
but
seem
to
force
themselves
upon
me
,
whether
I
would
or
no
;
and
strange
to
say
,
I
sometimes
recognise
in
them
counterpart
of
figure
once
familiar
to
me
in
picture
attach
to
childish
book
,
forget
long
ago
.
   
<EOS>
It
soon
become
too
dark
,
however
,
even
for
this
amusement
,
and
the
tree
be
so
close
together
that
their
dry
branch
rattle
against
the
coach
on
either
side
,
and
oblige
us
all
to
keep
our
head
within
.
 
<EOS>
It
lighten
too
,
for
three
whole
hour
;
each
flash
be
very
bright
,
and
blue
,
and
long
;
and
as
the
vivid
streak
come
dart
in
among
the
crowded
branch
,
and
the
thunder
roll
gloomily
above
the
tree
top
,
one
could
scarcely
help
think
that
there
be
well
neighbourhood
at
such
a
time
than
thick
wood
afford
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
,
between
ten
and
eleven
o'clock
at
night
,
a
few
feeble
light
appear
in
the
distance
,
and
Upper
Sandusky
,
an
indian
village
,
where
we
be
to
stay
till
morning
,
lie
before
us
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
go
to
bed
at
the
log
Inn
,
which
be
the
only
house
of
entertainment
in
the
place
,
but
soon
answer
to
our
knocking
,
and
get
some
tea
for
us
in
a
sort
of
kitchen
or
common
room
,
tapestrie
with
old
newspaper
,
paste
against
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
the
bed
-
chamber
to
which
my
wife
and
I
be
show
,
be
a
large
,
low
,
ghostly
room
;
with
a
quantity
of
withered
branch
on
the
hearth
,
and
two
door
without
any
fastening
,
opposite
to
each
other
,
both
opening
on
the
black
night
and
wild
country
,
and
so
contrived
,
that
one
of
them
always
blow
the
other
open
:
 
a
novelty
in
domestic
architecture
,
which
I
do
not
remember
to
have
see
before
,
and
which
I
be
somewhat
disconcert
to
have
force
on
my
attention
after
get
into
bed
,
as
I
have
a
considerable
sum
in
gold
for
our
travel
expense
,
in
my
dressing
-
case
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
the
luggage
,
however
,
pile
against
the
panel
,
soon
settle
this
difficulty
,
and
my
sleep
would
not
have
be
very
much
affect
that
night
,
I
believe
,
though
it
have
fail
to
do
so
.
   
<EOS>
My
Boston
friend
climb
up
to
bed
,
somewhere
in
the
roof
,
where
another
guest
be
already
snore
hugely
.
 
<EOS>
but
be
bite
beyond
his
power
of
endurance
,
he
turn
out
again
,
and
flee
for
shelter
to
the
coach
,
which
be
air
itself
in
front
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
not
a
very
politic
step
,
as
it
turn
out
;
for
the
pig
scent
him
,
and
look
upon
the
coach
as
a
kind
of
pie
with
some
manner
of
meat
inside
,
grunt
round
it
so
hideously
,
that
he
be
afraid
to
come
out
again
,
and
lie
there
shiver
,
till
morning
.
<EOS>
nor
be
it
possible
to
warm
him
,
when
he
do
come
out
,
by
mean
of
a
glass
of
brandy
:
 
for
in
indian
village
,
the
legislature
,
with
a
very
good
and
wise
intention
,
forbid
the
sale
of
spirit
by
tavern
keeper
.
 
<EOS>
the
precaution
,
however
,
be
quite
inefficacious
,
for
the
Indians
never
fail
to
procure
liquor
of
a
bad
kind
,
at
a
dearer
price
,
from
travel
pedlar
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
settlement
of
the
Wyandot
Indians
who
inhabit
this
place
.
<EOS>
among
the
company
at
breakfast
be
a
mild
old
gentleman
,
who
have
be
for
many
year
employ
by
the
United
States
Government
in
conduct
negotiation
with
the
Indians
,
and
who
have
just
conclude
a
treaty
with
these
people
by
which
they
bind
themselves
,
in
consideration
of
a
certain
annual
sum
,
to
remove
next
year
to
some
land
provide
for
them
,
west
of
the
Mississippi
,
and
a
little
way
beyond
St
Louis
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
me
a
moving
account
of
their
strong
attachment
to
the
familiar
scene
of
their
infancy
,
and
in
particular
to
the
burial
-
place
of
their
kindre
;
and
of
their
great
reluctance
to
leave
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
witness
many
such
removal
,
and
always
with
pain
,
though
he
know
that
they
depart
for
their
own
good
.
 
<EOS>
the
question
whether
this
tribe
should
go
or
stay
,
have
be
discuss
among
them
a
day
or
two
before
,
in
a
hut
erect
for
the
purpose
,
the
log
of
which
still
lie
upon
the
ground
before
the
inn
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
speaking
be
do
,
the
aye
and
no
be
range
on
opposite
side
,
and
every
male
adult
vote
in
his
turn
.
 
<EOS>
the
moment
the
result
be
know
,
the
minority
(
a
large
one
)
cheerfully
yield
to
the
rest
,
and
withdraw
all
kind
of
opposition
.
   
<EOS>
We
meet
some
of
these
poor
Indians
afterwards
,
ride
on
shaggy
pony
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
so
like
the
mean
sort
of
gipsy
,
that
if
I
could
have
see
any
of
them
in
England
,
I
should
have
conclude
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
that
they
belong
to
that
wander
and
restless
people
.
   
<EOS>
leave
this
town
directly
after
breakfast
,
we
push
forward
again
,
over
a
rather
bad
road
than
yesterday
,
if
possible
,
and
arrive
about
noon
at
Tiffin
,
where
we
part
with
the
extra
.
 
<EOS>
at
two
o'clock
we
take
the
railroad
;
the
travelling
on
which
be
very
slow
,
its
construction
be
indifferent
,
and
the
ground
wet
and
marshy
;
and
arrive
at
Sandusky
in
time
to
dine
that
evening
.
 
<EOS>
We
put
up
at
a
comfortable
little
hotel
on
the
brink
of
Lake
Erie
,
lie
there
that
night
,
and
have
no
choice
but
to
wait
there
next
day
,
until
a
steamboat
bind
for
Buffalo
appear
.
 
<EOS>
the
town
,
which
be
sluggish
and
uninteresting
enough
,
be
something
like
the
back
of
an
english
watering
-
place
,
out
of
the
season
.
   
<EOS>
Our
host
,
who
be
very
attentive
and
anxious
to
make
us
comfortable
,
be
a
handsome
middle
-
aged
man
,
who
have
come
to
this
town
from
New
England
,
in
which
part
of
the
country
he
be
"
raise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
when
I
say
that
he
constantly
walk
in
and
out
of
the
room
with
his
hat
on
;
and
stop
to
converse
in
the
same
free
-
and
-
easy
state
;
and
lie
down
on
our
sofa
,
and
pull
his
newspaper
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
read
it
at
his
ease
;
I
merely
mention
these
trait
as
characteristic
of
the
country
:
 
not
at
all
as
be
matter
of
complaint
,
or
as
have
be
disagreeable
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
undoubtedly
be
offend
by
such
proceeding
at
home
,
because
there
they
be
not
the
custom
,
and
where
they
be
not
,
they
would
be
impertinencie
;
but
in
America
,
the
only
desire
of
a
good
-
natured
fellow
of
this
kind
,
be
to
treat
his
guest
hospitably
and
well
;
and
I
have
no
more
right
,
and
<EOS>
I
can
truly
say
no
more
disposition
,
to
measure
his
conduct
by
our
english
rule
and
standard
,
than
I
have
to
quarrel
with
him
for
not
be
of
the
exact
stature
which
would
qualify
him
for
admission
into
the
Queen
's
grenadier
guard
.
 
<EOS>
as
little
inclination
have
I
to
find
fault
with
a
funny
old
lady
who
be
an
upper
domestic
in
this
establishment
,
and
who
,
when
she
come
to
wait
upon
us
at
any
meal
,
sit
herself
down
comfortably
in
the
most
convenient
chair
,
and
produce
a
large
pin
to
pick
her
tooth
with
,
remain
perform
that
ceremony
,
and
steadfastly
regard
us
meanwhile
with
much
gravity
and
composure
(
now
and
then
press
us
to
eat
a
little
more
)
,
until
it
be
time
to
clear
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
enough
for
us
,
that
whatever
we
wish
do
be
do
with
great
civility
and
readiness
,
and
a
desire
to
oblige
,
not
only
here
,
but
everywhere
else
;
and
that
all
our
want
be
,
in
general
,
zealously
anticipate
.
   
<EOS>
We
be
take
an
early
dinner
at
this
house
,
on
the
day
after
our
arrival
,
which
be
Sunday
,
when
a
steamboat
come
in
sight
,
and
presently
touch
at
the
wharf
.
 
<EOS>
as
she
prove
to
be
on
her
way
to
Buffalo
,
we
hurry
on
board
with
all
speed
,
and
soon
leave
Sandusky
far
behind
us
.
   
<EOS>
She
be
a
large
vessel
of
five
hundred
ton
,
and
handsomely
fit
up
,
though
with
high
-
pressure
engine
;
<EOS>
which
always
convey
that
kind
of
feeling
to
me
,
which
I
should
be
likely
to
experience
,
I
think
,
if
I
have
lodging
on
the
first
-
floor
of
a
powder
-
mill
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
laden
with
flour
,
some
cask
of
which
commodity
be
store
upon
the
deck
.
 
<EOS>
the
captain
come
up
to
have
a
little
conversation
,
and
to
introduce
a
friend
,
seat
himself
astride
of
one
of
these
barrel
,
like
a
Bacchus
of
private
life
;
and
pull
a
great
clasp
-
knife
out
of
his
pocket
,
begin
to
"
whittle
"
it
as
he
talk
,
by
pare
thin
slice
off
the
edge
.
 
<EOS>
and
he
whittle
with
such
industry
and
hearty
good
will
,
that
but
for
his
be
call
away
very
soon
,
it
must
have
disappear
bodily
,
and
leave
nothing
in
its
place
but
grist
and
shaving
.
   
<EOS>
after
call
at
one
or
two
flat
place
,
with
low
dam
stretch
out
into
the
lake
,
whereon
be
stumpy
lighthouse
,
like
windmill
without
sail
,
the
whole
look
like
a
dutch
vignette
,
we
come
at
midnight
to
Cleveland
,
where
we
lay
all
night
,
and
until
nine
o'clock
next
morning
.
   
<EOS>
I
entertain
quite
a
curiosity
in
reference
to
this
place
,
from
have
see
at
Sandusky
a
speciman
of
its
literature
in
the
shape
of
a
newspaper
,
which
be
very
strong
indeed
upon
the
subject
of
Lord
Ashburton
's
recent
arrival
at
Washington
,
to
adjust
the
point
in
dispute
between
the
United
States
Government
and
Great
Britain
:
inform
its
reader
that
as
America
have
"
whip
"
England
in
her
infancy
,
and
whip
her
again
in
her
youth
,
<EOS>
so
it
be
clearly
necessary
that
she
must
whip
her
once
again
in

I
find
it
a
pretty
town
,
and
have
the
satisfaction
of
behold
the
outside
of
the
office
of
the
journal
from
which
I
have
just
quote
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
enjoy
the
delight
of
see
the
wit
who
indite
the
paragraph
in
question
,
but
I
have
no
doubt
he
be
a
prodigious
man
in
his
way
,
and
hold
in
high
repute
by
a
select
circle
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
gentleman
on
board
,
to
whom
,
<EOS>
as
I
unintentionally
learn
through
the
thin
partition
which
divide
our
state
-
room
from
the
cabin
in
which
he
and
his
wife
converse
together
,
I
be
unwittingly
the
occasion
of
very
great
uneasiness
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
why
or
wherefore
,
but
I
appear
to
run
in
his
mind
perpetually
,
and
to
dissatisfy
him
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
first
of
all
I
hear
him
say
:
and
the
most
ludicrous
part
of
the
business
be
,
that
he
say
it
in
my
very
ear
,
and
could
not
have
communicate
more
directly
with
me
,
if
he
have
lean
upon
my
shoulder
,
and
whisper
me
:
 
<EOS>
"
Boz
be
on
board
still
,
my
dear
.
"
 
<EOS>
after
a
considerable
pause
,
he
add
,
complainingly
,
"
Boz
keep
himself
very
close
;
"
which
be
true
enough
,
for
I
be
not
very
well
,
and
be
lie
down
,
with
a
book
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
have
do
with
me
after
this
,
but
I
be
deceive
;
for
a
long
interval
have
elapse
,
during
which
I
imagine
him
to
have
be
turn
restlessly
from
side
to
side
,
and
try
to
go
to
sleep
;
he
break
out
again
,
with
"
I
suppose
that
Boz
will
be
write
a
book
by
-
and
-
by
,
and
put
all
our
name
in
it
!
"
<EOS>
at
which
imaginary
consequence
of
be
on
board
a
boat
with
Boz
,
he
groan
,
and
become
silent
.
   
<EOS>
We
call
at
the
town
of
Erie
,
at
eight
o'clock
that
night
,
and
lie
there
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
between
five
and
six
next
morning
,
we
arrive
at
Buffalo
,
where
we
breakfast
;
and
be
too
near
the
Great
Falls
to
wait
patiently
anywhere
else
,
we
set
off
by
the
train
,
the
same
morning
at
nine
o'clock
,
to
Niagara
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
miserable
day
;
chilly
and
raw
;
a
damp
mist
fall
;
and
the
tree
in
that
northern
region
quite
bare
and
wintry
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
the
train
halt
,
I
listen
for
the
roar
;
and
be
constantly
strain
my
eye
in
the
direction
where
I
know
the
Falls
must
be
,
from
see
the
river
roll
on
towards
them
;
every
moment
expect
to
behold
the
spray
.
 
<EOS>
within
a
few
minute
of
our
stopping
,
not
before
,
I
see
two
great
white
cloud
rise
up
slowly
and
majestically
from
the
depth
of
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
all
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
we
alight
:
 
and
then
for
the
first
time
,
I
hear
the
mighty
rush
of
water
,
and
feel
the
ground
tremble
underneath
my
foot
.
   
<EOS>
the
bank
be
very
steep
,
and
be
slippery
with
rain
,
and
half
-
melted
ice
.
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
how
I
get
down
,
but
I
be
soon
at
the
bottom
,
and
climb
,
with
two
english
officer
who
be
cross
and
have
join
me
,
over
some
break
rock
,
deafen
by
the
noise
,
half
-
blind
by
the
spray
,
and
wet
to
the
skin
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
at
the
foot
of
the
American
Fall
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
see
an
immense
torrent
of
water
tear
headlong
down
from
some
great
height
,
but
have
no
idea
of
shape
,
or
situation
,
or
anything
but
vague
immensity
.
   
<EOS>
when
we
be
seat
in
the
little
ferry
-
boat
,
and
be
cross
the
swollen
river
immediately
before
both
cataract
,
I
begin
to
feel
what
it
be
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
in
a
manner
stun
,
and
unable
to
comprehend
the
vastness
of
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
I
come
on
Table
Rock
,
and
look
---
<EOS>
Great
Heaven
,
on
what
a
fall
of
bright
-
green
water
!
---
that
it
come
upon
me
in
its
full
might
and
majesty
.
   
<EOS>
then
,
when
I
feel
how
near
to
my
Creator
<EOS>
I
be
stand
,
the
first
effect
,
and
the
endure
one
---
instant
and
lasting
---
of
the
tremendous
spectacle
,
be
peace
.
 
<EOS>
peace
of
Mind
,
tranquillity
,
calm
recollection
of
the
dead
,
great
thought
of
Eternal
Rest
and
happiness
:
 
nothing
of
gloom
or
terror
.
 
<EOS>
Niagara
be
at
once
stamp
upon
my
heart
,
an
image
of
Beauty
;
to
remain
there
,
changeless
and
indelible
,
until
its
pulse
cease
to
beat
,
for
ever
.
   
<EOS>
oh
,
how
the
strife
and
trouble
of
daily
life
recede
from
my
view
,
and
lessen
in
the
distance
,
during
the
ten
memorable
day
we
pass
on
that
Enchanted
Ground
!
 
<EOS>
what
voice
speak
from
out
the
thundering
water
;
what
face
,
fade
from
the
earth
,
look
out
upon
me
from
its
gleaming
depth
;
what
Heavenly
promise
glisten
in
those
angel
'
tear
,
the
drop
of
many
hue
,
that
shower
around
,
and
twine
themselves
about
the
gorgeous
arch
which
the

rainbow
make
!
   
<EOS>
I
never
stir
in
all
that
time
from
the
canadian
side
,
whither
<EOS>
I
have
go
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
cross
the
river
again
;
for
I
know
there
be
people
on
the
other
shore
,
and
in
such
a
place
it
be
natural
to
shun
strange
company
.
 
<EOS>
to
wander
to
and
fro
all
day
,
and
see
the
cataract
from
all
point
of
view
;
to
stand
upon
the
edge
of
the
great
Horse
-
Shoe
Fall
,
mark
the
hurried
water
gathering
strength
as
it
approach
the
verge
,
yet
seem
,
too
,
to
pause
before
it
shoot
into
the
gulf
below
;
to
gaze
from
the
river
's
level
up
at
the
torrent
as
it
come
stream
down
;
to
climb
the
neighbouring
height
and
watch
it
through
the
tree
,
and
see
the
wreathe
water
in
the
rapid
hurry
on
to
take
its
fearful
plunge
;
to
linger
in
the
shadow
of
the
solemn
rock
three
mile
below
;
watch
the
river
as
,
stir
by
no
visible
cause
,
it
heave
and
eddy
and
awake
the
echo
,
be
trouble
yet
,
far
down
beneath
the
surface
,
by
its
giant
leap
;
to
have
Niagara
before
me
,
light
by
the
sun
and
by
the
moon
,
red
in
the
day
's
decline
,
and
grey
as
evening
slowly
fall
upon
it
;
to
look
upon
it
every
day
,
and
wake
up
in
the
night
and
hear
its
ceaseless
voice
:
 
<EOS>
this
be
enough
.
   
<EOS>
I
think
in
every
quiet
season
now
,
still
do
those
water
roll
and
leap
,
and
roar
and
tumble
,
all
day
long
;
still
be
the
rainbow
span
them
,
a
hundred
foot
below
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
when
the
sun
be
on
them
,
do
they
shine
and
glow
like
molten
gold
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
when
the
day
be
gloomy
,
do
they
fall
like
snow
,
or
seem
to
crumble
away
like
the
front
of
a
great
chalk
cliff
,
or
roll
down
the
rock
like
dense
white
smoke
.
 
<EOS>
but
always
do
the
mighty
stream
appear
to
die
as
it
come
down
,
and
always
from
its
unfathomable
grave
arise
that
tremendous
ghost
of
spray
and
mist
which
be
never
lay
:
 
which
have
haunt
this
place
with
the
same
dread
solemnity
since
darkness
brood
on
the
deep
,
and
that
first
flood
before
the
Deluge
---
light
 
---
 
come
rush
on
Creation
at
the

<EOS>
in

Again
;

West

I
wish
to
abstain
from
institute
any
comparison
,
or
draw
any
parallel
whatever
,
between
the
social
feature
of
the
United
States
and
those
of
the
British
Possessions
in
Canada
.
 
<EOS>
for
this
reason
,
I
shall
confine
myself
to
a
very
brief
account
of
our
journeying
in
the
latter
territory
.
   
<EOS>
but
before
I
leave
Niagara
,
I
must
advert
to
one
disgusting
circumstance
which
can
hardly
have
escape
the
observation
of
any
decent
traveller
who
have
visit
the
Falls
.
   
<EOS>
on
Table
Rock
,
there
be
a
cottage
belong
to
a
Guide
,
where
little
relic
of
the
place
be
sell
,
and
where
visitor
register
their
name
in
a
book
keep
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
wall
of
the
room
in
which
a
great
many
of
these
volume
be
preserve
,
the
follow
request
be
post
:
 
"
visitor
will
please
not
copy
nor
extract
the
remark
and
poetical
effusion
from
the
register
and
album
keep
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
but
for
this
intimation
,
I
should
have
let
them
lie
upon
the
table
on
which
they
be
strew
with
careful
negligence
,
like
book
in
a
drawing
-
room
:
 
be
quite
satisfied
with
the
stupendous
silliness
of
certain
stanza
with
an
anti
-
climax
at
the
end
of
each
,
which
be
frame
and
hang
up
on
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
Curious
,
however
,
after
read
this
announcement
,
to
see
what
kind
of
morsel
be
so
carefully
preserve
,
I
turn
a
few
leave
,
and
find
them
scrawl
all
over
with
the
vilest
and
the
filthiest
ribaldry
that
ever
human
hog
delight
in
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
humiliating
enough
to
know
that
there
be
among
man
brute
so
obscene
and
worthless
,
that
they
can
delight
in
lay
their
miserable
profanation
upon
the
very
step
of
Nature
's
great
altar
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
these
should
be
hoard
up
for
the
delight
of
their
fellow
-
swine
,
and
keep
in
a
public
place
where
any
eye
may
see
them
,
be
a
disgrace
to
the
english
language
in
which
they
be
write
(
though
I
hope
few
of
these
entry
have
be
make
by
Englishmen
)
,
and
a
reproach
to
the
english
side
,
on
which
they
be
preserve
.
   
<EOS>
the
quarter
of
our
soldier
at
Niagara
,
be
finely
and
airily
situate
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
them
be
large
detached
house
on
the
plain
above
the
Falls
,
which
be
originally
design
for
hotel
;
and
in
the
evening
time
,
when
the
woman
and
child
be
lean
over
the
balcony
watch
the
man
as
they
play
at
ball
and
other
game
upon
the
grass
before
the
door
,
they
often
present
a
little
picture
of
cheerfulness
and
animation
which
make
it
quite
a
pleasure
to
pass
that
way
.
   
<EOS>
at
any
garrisoned
point
where
the
line
of
demarcation
between
one
country
and
another
be
so
very
narrow
as
at
Niagara
,
desertion
from
the
rank
can
scarcely
fail
to
be
of
frequent
occurrence
:
 
and
it
may
be
reasonably
suppose
that
when
the
soldier
entertain
the
wild
and
maddest
hope
of
the
fortune
and
independence
that
await
them
on
the
other
side
,
the
impulse
to
play
traitor
,
which
such
a
place
suggest
to
dishonest
mind
,
be
not
weaken
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
very
rarely
happen
that
the
man
who
do
desert
,
be
happy
or
contented
afterwards
;
and
many
instance
have
be
know
in
which
they
have
confess
their
grievous
disappointment
,
and
their
earnest
desire
to
return
to
their
old
service
if
they
could
but
be
assure
of
pardon
,
or
lenient
treatment
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
their
comrade
,
notwithstanding
<EOS>
,
do
the
like
,
from
time
to
time
;
and
instance
of
loss
of
life
in
the
effort
to
cross
the
river
with
this
object
,
be
far
from
be
uncommon
.
 
<EOS>
several
man
be
drown
in
the
attempt
to
swim
across
,
not
long
ago
;
and
one
,
who
have
the
madness
to
trust
himself
upon
a
table
as
a
raft
,
be
sweep
down
to
the
whirlpool
,
where
his
mangle
body
eddy
round
and
round
some
day
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
inclined
to
think
that
the
noise
of
the
Falls
be
very
much
exaggerated
;
and
this
will
appear
the
more
probable
when
the
depth
of
the
great
basin
in
which
the
water
be
receive
,
be
take
into
account
.
 
<EOS>
at
no
time
during
our
stay
there
,
be
the
wind
at
all
high
or
boisterous
,
but
we
never
hear
them
,
three
mile
off
,
even
at
the
very
quiet
time
of
sunset
,
though
we
often
try
.
   
<EOS>
Queenston
,
at
which
place
the
steamboat
start
for
Toronto
(
or
<EOS>
I
should
rather
say
at
which
place
they
call
,
for
their
wharf
be
at
Lewiston
,
on
the
opposite
shore
)
,
be
situate
in
a
delicious
valley
,
through
which
the
Niagara
river
,
in
colour
a
very
deep
green
,
pursue
its
course
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
approach
by
a
road
that
take
its
wind
way
among
the
height
by
which
the
town
be
shelter
;
and
see
from
this
point
be
extremely
beautiful
and
picturesque
.
<EOS>
on
the
most
conspicuous
of
these
height
stand
a
monument
erect
by
the
Provincial
Legislature
in
memory
of
General
Brock
,
who
be
slay
in
a
battle
with
the
american
force
,
after
have
win
the
victory
.
 
<EOS>
some
vagabond
,
suppose
to
be
a
fellow
of
the
name
of
Lett
,
who
be
now
,
or
who
lately
be
,
in
prison
as
a
felon
,
blow
up
this
monument
two
year
ago
,
and
it
be
now
a
melancholy
ruin
,
with
a
long
fragment
of
iron
rail
hang
dejectedly
from
its
top
,
and
wave
to
and
fro
like
a
wild
ivy
branch
or
break
vine
stem
.
<EOS>
It
be
of
much
high
importance
than
it
may
seem
,
that
this
statue
should
be
repair
at
the
public
cost
,
as
it
ought
to
have
be
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
firstly
,
because
it
be
beneath
the
dignity
of
England
to
allow
a
memorial
raise
in
honour
of
one
of
her
defender
,
to
remain
in
this
condition
,
on
the
very
spot
where
he
die
.
<EOS>
secondly
,
because
the
sight
of
it
in
its
present
state
,
and
the
recollection
of
the
unpunished
outrage
which
bring
it
to
this
pass
,
be
not
very
likely
to
soothe
down
border
feeling
among
english
subject
here
,
or
compose
their
border
quarrel
and
dislike
.
   
<EOS>
I
be

at
this
place
,
watch
the
passenger
embark
in
a
steamboat
which
precede
that
whose
come
we
await
,
and
participate
in
the
anxiety
with
which
a
sergeant
's
wife
be
collect
her
few
good
together
---
keep
one
distracted
eye
hard
upon
the
porter
,
who
be
hurry
them
on
board
,
and
the
other
on
a
hoopless
washing
-
tub
for
which
,
as
be
the
most
utterly
worthless
of
all
her
movable
<EOS>
,
she
seem
to
entertain
particular
affection
---
when
three
or
four
soldier
with
a
recruit
come
up
and
go
on
board
.
   
<EOS>
the
recruit
be
a
likely
young
fellow
enough
,
strongly
build
and
well
make
,
but
by
no
means
sober
:
 
<EOS>
indeed
he
have
all
the
air
of
a
man
who
have
be
more
or
less
drunk
for
some
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
carry
a
small
bundle
over
his
shoulder
,
sling
at
the
end
of
a
walking
-
stick
,
and
have
a
short
pipe
in
his
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
as
dusty
and
dirty
as
recruit
usually
be
,
and
his
shoe
betoken
that
he
have
travel
on
foot
some
distance
,
but
he
be
in
a
very
jocose
state
,
and
shake
hand
with
this
soldier
,
and
clap
that
one
on
the
back
,
and
talk
and
laugh
continually
,
like
a
roar
idle
dog
as
he
be
.
   
<EOS>
the
soldier
rather
laugh
at
this
blade
than
with
him
:
 
seem
to
say
,
as
they
stand
straighten
their
cane
in
their
hand
,
and
look
coolly
at
him
over
their
glaze
stock
,
"
go
on
,
my
boy
,
while
you
may
!
<EOS>
you
will
know
well
by
-
and
-
by
:
"
when
suddenly
the
novice
,
who
have
be
back
towards
the
gangway
in
his
noisy
merriment
,
fall
overboard
before
their
eye
,
and
splash
heavily
down
into
the
river
between
the
vessel
and
the
dock
.
   
<EOS>
I
never
see
such
a
good
thing
as
the
change
that
come
over
these
soldier
in
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
almost
before
the
man
be
down
,
their
professional
manner
,
their
stiffness
and
constraint
,
be
go
,
and
they
be
fill
with
the
most
violent
energy
.
 
<EOS>
in
less
time
than
be
require
to
tell
it
,
they
have
him
out
again
,
foot
first
,
with
the
tail
of
his
coat
flap
over
his
eye
,
everything
about
him
hang
the
wrong
way
,
and
the
water
stream
off
at
every
thread
in
his
threadbare
dress
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
moment
they
set
him
upright
and
find
that
he
be
none
the
bad
,
they
be
soldier
again
,
look
over
their
glaze
stock
more
composedly
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
the
half
-
sobered
recruit
glance
round
for
a
moment
,
as
if
his
first
impulse
be
to
express
some
gratitude
for
his
preservation
,
but
see
them
with
this
air
of
total
unconcern
,
and
have
his
wet
pipe
present
to
him
with
an
oath
by
the
soldier
who
have
be
by
far
the
most
anxious
of
the
party
,
he
stick
it
in
his
mouth
,
thrust
his
hand
into
his
moist
pocket
,
and
without
even
shake
the
water
off
his
clothe
,
walk
on
board
whistle
;
not
to
say
as
if
nothing
have
happen
,
but
as
if
he
have
mean
to
do
it
,
and
it
have
be
a
perfect
success
.
   
<EOS>
Our
steamboat
come
up
directly
this
have
leave
the
wharf
,
and
soon
bear
us
to
the
mouth
of
the
Niagara
;
where
the
star
and
stripe
of
America
flutter
on
one
side
and
the
Union
Jack
of
England
on
the
other
:
 
and
so
narrow
be
the
space
between
them
that
the
sentinel
in
either
fort
can
often
hear
the
watchword
of
the
other
country
give
.
 
<EOS>
Thence
we
emerge
on
Lake
Ontario
,
an
inland
sea
;
and
by
half
-
past
six
o'clock
be
at
Toronto
.
   
<EOS>
the
country
round
this
town
be
very
flat
,
be
bare
of
scenic
interest
;
but
the
town
itself
be
full
of
life
and
motion
,
bustle
,
business
,
and
improvement
.
 
<EOS>
the
street
be
well
pave
,
and
light
with
gas
;
the
house
be
large
and
good
;
the
shop
excellent
.
 
<EOS>
many
of
them
have
a
display
of
good
in
their
window
,
such
as
may
be
see
in
thrive
county
town
in
England
;
and
there
be
some
which
would
do
no
discredit
to
the
metropolis
itself
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
good
stone
prison
here
;
and
there
be
,
besides
,
a
handsome
church
,
a
court
-
house
,
public
office
,
many
commodious
private
residence
,
and
a
government
observatory
for
note
and
record
the
magnetic
variation
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
College
of
Upper
Canada
,
which
be
one
of
the
public
establishment
of
the
city
,
a
sound
education
in
every
department
of
polite
learning
can
be
have
,
at
a
very
moderate
expense
:
 
the
annual
charge
for
the
instruction
of
each
pupil
,
not
exceed
nine
pound
sterling
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
pretty
good
endowment
in
the
way
of
land
,
and
be
a
valuable
and
useful
institution
.
   
<EOS>
the
first
stone
of
a
new
college
have
be
lay
but
a
few
day
before
,
by
the
Governor
General
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
handsome
,
spacious
edifice
,
approach
by
a
long
avenue
,
which
be
already
plant
and
make
available
as
a
public
walk
.
 
<EOS>
the
town
be
well
adapt
for
wholesome
exercise
at
all
season
,
for
the
footway
in
the
thoroughfare
which
lie
beyond
the
principal
street
,
be
plank
like
floor
,
and
keep
in
very
good
and
clean
repair
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
matter
of
deep
regret
that
political
difference
should
have
run
high
in
this
place
,
and
lead
to
most
discreditable
and
disgraceful
result
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
not
long
since
gun
be
discharge
from
a
window
in
this
town
at
the
successful
candidate
in
an
election
,
and
the
coachman
of
one
of
them
be
actually
shoot
in
the
body
,
though
not
dangerously
wound
.
 
<EOS>
but
one
man
be
kill
on
the
same
occasion
;
and
from
the
very
window
whence
he
receive
his
death
,
the
very
flag
which
shield
his
murderer
(
not
only
in
the
commission
of
his
crime
,
but
from
its
consequence
)
,
be
display
again
on
the
occasion
of
the
public
ceremony
perform
by
the
Governor
General
,
to
which
I
have
just
advert
.
 
<EOS>
of
all
the
colour
in
the
rainbow
,
there
be
but
one
which
could
be
so
employ
:
 
I
need
not
say
that
flag
be
orange
.
   
<EOS>
the
time
of
leave
Toronto
for
Kingston
be
noon
.
 
<EOS>
by
eight
o'clock
next
morning
,
the
traveller
be
at
the
end
of
his
journey
,
which
be
perform
by
steamboat
upon
Lake
Ontario
,
call
at
Port
Hope
and
Coburg
,
the
latter
a
cheerful
,
thriving
little
town
.
 
<EOS>
vast
quantity
of
flour
form
the
chief
item
in
the
freight
of
these
vessel
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
no
few
than
one
thousand
and
eighty
barrel
on
board
,
between
Coburg
and
Kingston
.
   
<EOS>
the
latter
place
,
which
be
now
the
seat
of
government
in
Canada
,
be
a
very
poor
town
,
render
still
poor
in
the
appearance
of
its
market
-
place
by
the
ravage
of
a
recent
fire
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
may
be
say
of
Kingston
,
that
one
half
of
it
appear
to
be
burn
down
,
and
the
other
half
not
to
be
build
up
.
 
<EOS>
the
Government
House
be
neither
elegant
nor
commodious
,
yet
it
be
almost
the
only
house
of
any
importance
in
the
neighbourhood
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
an
admirable
jail
here
,
well
and
wisely
govern
,
and
excellently
regulate
,
in
every
respect
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
be
employ
as
shoemaker
,
ropemaker
,
blacksmith
,
tailor
,
carpenter
,
and
stonecutter
;
and
in
build
a
new
prison
,
which
be
pretty
far
advanced
towards
completion
.
 
<EOS>
the
female
prisoner
be
occupy
in
needlework
.
 
<EOS>
among
them
be
a
beautiful
girl
of
twenty
,
who
have
be
there
nearly
three
year
.
 
<EOS>
She
act
as
bearer
of
secret
despatch
for
the
self
-
style
Patriots
on
Navy
Island
,
during
the
canadian
Insurrection
:
 
sometimes
dress
as
a
girl
,
and
carry
them
in
her
stay
;
sometimes
attire
herself
as
a
boy
,
and
secrete
them
in
the
lining
of
her
hat
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
latter
character
she
always
ride
as
a
boy
would
,
which
be
nothing
to
her
,
for
she
could
govern
any
horse
that
any
man
could
ride
,
and
could
drive
four
-
in
-
hand
with
the
good
whip
in
those
part
.
 
<EOS>
set
forth
on
one
of
her
patriotic
mission
,
she
appropriate
to
herself
the
first
horse
she
could
lay
her
hand
on
;
and
this
offence
have
bring
her
where
I
see
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
quite
a
lovely
face
,
though
,
as
the
reader
may
suppose
from
this
sketch
of
her
history
,
there
be
a
lurk
devil
in
her
bright
eye
,
which
look
out
pretty
sharply
from
between
her
prison
bar
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
bomb
-
proof
fort
here
of
great
strength
,
which
occupy
a
bold
position
,
and
be
capable
,
doubtless
,
of
do
good
service
;
though
the
town
be
much
too
close
upon
the
frontier
to
be
long
hold
,
I
should
imagine
,
for
its
present
purpose
in
troubled
time
.
<EOS>
there
be
also
a
small
navy
-
yard
,
where
a
couple
of
Government
steamboat
be
build
,
and
get
on
vigorously
.
   
<EOS>
We
leave
Kingston
for
Montreal
on
the
tenth
of
May
,
at
half
-
past
nine
in
the
morning
,
and
proceed
in
a
steamboat
down
the
St
Lawrence
river
.
 
<EOS>
the
beauty
of
this
noble
stream
at
almost
any
point
,
but
especially
in
the
commencement
of
this
journey
when
it
wind
its
way
among
the
thousand
Islands
,
can
hardly
be
imagine
.
<EOS>
the
number
and
constant
succession
of
these
island
,
all
green
and
richly
woode
;
their
fluctuating
size
,
some
so
large
that
for
half
an
hour
together
one
among
them
will
appear
as
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
,
and
some
so
small
that
they
be
mere
dimple
on
its
broad
bosom
;
their
infinite
variety
of
shape
;
and
the
numberless
combination
of
beautiful
form
which
the
tree
grow
on
them
present
:
 
all
form
a
picture
fraught
with
uncommon
interest
and
pleasure
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
afternoon
we
shoot
down
some
rapid
where
the
river
boil
and
bubble
strangely
,
and
where
the
force
and
headlong
violence
of
the
current
be
tremendous
.
 
<EOS>
at
seven
o'clock
we
reach
Dickenson
's
landing
,
whence
traveller
proceed
for
two
or
three
hour
by
stage
-
coach
:
 
the
navigation
of
the
river
be
render
so
dangerous
and
difficult
in
the
interval
,
by
rapid
,
that
steamboat
do
not
make
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
the
number
and
length
of
those
PORTAGES
,
over
which
the
road
be
bad
,
and
the
travel
slow
,
render
the
way
between
the
town
of
Montreal
and
Kingston
,
somewhat
tedious
.
   
<EOS>
Our
course
lie
over
a
wide
,
uninclosed
tract
of
country
at
a
little
distance
from
the
river
-
side
,
whence
the
bright
warning
light
on
the
dangerous
part
of
the
St
Lawrence
shine
vividly
.
 
<EOS>
the
night
be
dark
and
raw
,
and
the
way
dreary
enough
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
nearly
ten
o'clock
when
we
reach
the
wharf
where
the
next
steamboat
lie
;
and
go
on
board
,
and
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
She
lie
there
all
night
,
and
start
as
soon
as
it
be
day
.
 
<EOS>
the
morning
be
usher
in
by
a
violent
thunderstorm
,
and
be
very
wet
,
but
gradually
improve
and
brighten
up
.
 
<EOS>
go
on
deck
after
breakfast
,
I
be
amazed
to
see
float
down
with
the
stream
,
a
most
gigantic
raft
,
with
some
thirty
or
forty
wooden
house
upon
it
,
and
at
least
as
many
flag
-
mast
,
so
that
it
look
like
a
nautical
street
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
many
of
these
raft
afterwards
,
but
never
one
so
large
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
timber
,
or
"
lumber
,
"
as
it
be
call
in
America
,
which
be
bring
down
the
St
Lawrence
,
be
float
down
in
this
manner
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
raft
reach
its
place
of
destination
,
it
be
break
up
;
the
material
be
sell
;
and
the
boatman
return
for
more
.
   
<EOS>
at
eight
we
land
again
,
and
travel
by
a
stage
-
coach
for
four
hour
through
a
pleasant
and
well
-
cultivate
country
,
perfectly
french
in
every
respect
:
 
in
the
appearance
of
the
cottage
;
the
air
,
language
,
and
dress
of
the
peasantry
;
the
sign
-
board
on
the
shop
and
tavern
:
 
and
the
Virgin
's
shrine
,
and
crosse
,
by
the
wayside
.
 
<EOS>
nearly
every
common
labourer
and
boy
,
though
he
have
no
shoe
to
his
foot
,
wear
round
his
waist
a
sash
of
some
bright
colour
:
 
generally
red

and
the

the
field
and
garden
,
and
do
all
kind
of
husbandry
,
wear
,
one

<EOS>
there

street
;
and

the
Saviour
at
the
corner
of

and
in
other
public
place
.
   
<EOS>
at
noon
we
go
on
board
another
steamboat
,
and
reach
the
village
of
Lachine
,
nine
mile
from
Montreal
,
by
three
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
we
leave
the
river
,
and
go
on
by
land
.
   
<EOS>
Montreal
be
pleasantly
situate
on
the
margin
of
the
St
Lawrence
,
and
be
back
by
some
bold
height
,
about
which
there
be
charming
ride
and
drive
.
 
<EOS>
the
street
be
generally
narrow
and
irregular
,
as
in
most
french
town
of
any
age
;
but
in
the
more
modern
part
of
the
city
,
they
be
wide
and
airy
.
 
<EOS>
They
display
a
great
variety
of
very
good
shop
;
and
both
in
the
town
and
suburb
there
be
many
excellent
private
dwelling
.
 
<EOS>
the
granite
quay
be
remarkable
for
their
beauty

and
extent
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
a
very
large
catholic
cathedral
here
,
recently
erect
with
two
tall

grim

square

which
have
a
quaint
and
remarkable
appearance
,
and
which
the
wiseacre
of
the
place
have
consequently
determine
to
pull
down
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
the
Government
House
be
very
superior
to
that
at
Kingston
,
and
the
town
be
full
of
life
and
bustle
.
 
<EOS>
in
one
of
the

a

five

six

and
a
famous
road
it
be
too
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
ride
in
the
vicinity
be
make
doubly
interesting
by
the
burst
out
of
spring
,
which
be
here
so
rapid

that
it

a
day
's
leap
from
barren

,
to
the

youth
of
summer

<EOS>
the
steamboat
to
Quebec
perform
the
journey
in
the
night
;
that
be
to
say
,
they
leave
Montreal
at
six
in
the
evening
,
and
arrive
at
Quebec
at
six
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
We
make
this
excursion
during
our
stay
in
Montreal
(
which
exceed
a
fortnight
)
,
and
be
charm
by
its
interest
and
beauty
.
   
<EOS>
the
impression
make
upon
the
visitor
by
this
Gibraltar
of
America
:
its
giddy
height
;
its
citadel
suspend
,
as
it
be
,
in
the
air
;
its
picturesque
steep
street
and
frown
gateway
;
and
the
splendid
view
which
burst
upon
the
eye
at
every
turn
:
 
be
at
once
unique
and
lasting
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
a
place
not
to
be
forget
or
mix
up
in
the
mind
with
other
place
,
or
alter
for
a
moment
in
the
crowd
of
scene
a
traveller
can
recall
.
 
<EOS>
apart
from
the
reality
of
this
most
picturesque
city
,
there
be
association
cluster
about
it
which
would
make
a
desert
rich
in
interest
.
 
<EOS>
the
dangerous
precipice
along
whose
rocky
front
,
Wolfe
and
his
brave
companion
climb
to
glory
;
the
Plains
of
Abraham
,
where
he
receive
his
mortal
wound
;
the
fortress
so
chivalrously
defended
by
Montcalm
;
and
his
soldier
's
grave
,
dig
for
him
while
yet
alive
,
by
the
bursting
of
a
shell
;
be
not
the
least
among
them
,
or
among
the
gallant
incident
of
history
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
noble
Monument
too
,
and
worthy
of
two
great
nation
,
which
perpetuate
the
memory
of
both
brave
general
,
and
on
which
their
name
be
jointly
write
.
   
<EOS>
the
city
be
rich
in
public
institution
and
in
catholic
church
and
charity
,
but
it
be
mainly
in
the
prospect
from
the
site
of
the
Old
Government
House
,
and
from
the
Citadel
,
that
its
surpass
beauty
lie
.
 
<EOS>
the
exquisite
expanse
of
country
,
rich
in
field
and
forest
,
mountain
-
height
and
water
,
which
lie
stretch
out
before
the
view
,
with
mile
of
canadian
village
,
glance
in
long
white
streak
,
like
vein
along
the
landscape
;
the
motley
crowd
of
gable
,
roof
,
and
chimney
top
in
the
old
hilly
town
immediately
at
hand
;
the
beautiful
St
Lawrence
sparkle
and
flash
in
the
sunlight
;
and
the
tiny
ship
below
the
rock
from
which
you
gaze
,
whose
distant
rigging
look
like
spider
'
webs
against
the
light
,
while
cask
and
barrel
on
their
deck
dwindle
into
toy
,
and
busy
mariner
become
so
many
puppet
;
all
this
,
frame
by
a
sink
window
in
the
fortress
and
look
at
from
the
shadowed
room
within
,
form
one
of
the
bright
and
most
enchanting
picture
that
the
eye
can
rest
upon
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
spring
of
the
year
,
vast
number
of
emigrant
who
have
newly
arrive
from
England
or
from
Ireland
,
pass
between
Quebec
and
Montreal
on
their
way
to
the
backwood
and
new
settlement
of
Canada
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
be
an
entertaining
lounge
(
as
I
very
often
find
it
)
to
take
a
morning
stroll
upon
the
quay
at
Montreal
,
and
see
them
group
in
hundred
on
the
public
wharf
about
their
chest
and
box
,
it
be
matter
of
deep
interest
to
be
their
fellow
-
passenger
on
one
of
these
steamboat
,
and
mingle
with
the
concourse
,
see
and
hear
them
unobserved
.
   
<EOS>
the
vessel
in
which
we
return
from
Quebec
to
Montreal
be
crowd
with
them
,
and
at
night
they
spread
their
bed
between
deck
(
those
who
have
bed
,
at
least
)
,
and
sleep
so
close
and
thick
about
our
cabin
door
,
that
the
passage
to
and
fro
be
quite
block
up
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
nearly
all
English
;
from
Gloucestershire
the
great
part
;
and
have
have
a
long
winter
-
passage
out
;
but
it
be
wonderful
to
see
how
clean
the
child
have
be
keep
,
and
how
untire
in
their
love
and
self
-
denial
all
the
poor
parent
be
.
   
<EOS>
can
not
as
we
may
,
and
as
we
shall
to
the
end
of
all
thing
,
it
be
very
much
hard
for
the
poor
to
be
virtuous
than
it
be
for
the
rich
;
and
the
good
that
be
in
them
,
shine
the
bright
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
in
many
a
noble
mansion
live
a
man
,
the
good
of
husband
and
of
father
,
whose
private
worth
in
both
capacity
be
justly
laud
to
the
sky
.
 
<EOS>
but
bring
him
here
,
upon
this
crowded
deck
.
 
<EOS>
Strip
from
his
fair
young
wife
her
silken
dress
and
jewel
,
unbind
her
braided
hair
,
stamp
early
wrinkle
on
her
brow
,
pinch
her
pale
cheek
with
care
and
much
privation
,
array
her
fade
form
in
coarsely
patch
attire
,
let
there
be
nothing
but
his
love
to
set
her
forth
or
deck
her
out
,
and
you
shall
put
it
to
the
proof
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
so
change
his
station
in
the
world
,
that
he
shall
see
in
those
young
thing
who
climb
about
his
knee
:
 
not
record
of
his
wealth
and
name
:
 
but
little
wrestler
with
him
for
his
daily
bread
;
so
many
poacher
on
his
scanty
meal
;
so
many
unit
to
divide
his
every
sum
of
comfort
,
and
farther
to
reduce
its
small
amount
.
 
<EOS>
in
lieu
of
the
endearment
of
childhood
in
its
sweetest
aspect
,
heap
upon
him
all
its
pain
and
want
,
its
sickness
and
ill
,
its
fretfulness
,
caprice
,
and
querulous
endurance
:
 
let
its
prattle
be
,
not
of
engage
infant
fancy
,
but
of
cold
,
and
thirst
,
and
hunger
:
 
and
if
his
fatherly
affection
outlive
all
this
,
and
he
be
patient
,
watchful
,
tender
;
careful
of
his
child
's
life
,
and
mindful
always
of
their
joy
and
sorrow
;
then
send
him
back
to
Parliament
,
and
Pulpit
,
and
to
Quarter
Sessions
,
and
when
he
hear
fine
talk
of
the
depravity
of
those
who
live
from
hand
to
mouth
,
and
labour
hard
to
do
it
,
let
him
speak
up
,
as
one
who
know
,
and
tell
those
holder
forth
that
they
,
by
parallel
with
such
a
class
,
should
be
high
Angels
in
their
daily
life
,
and
lay
but
humble
siege
to
Heaven
at
last
.
   
<EOS>
which
of
us
shall
say
what
he
would
be
,
if
such
reality
,
with
small
relief
or
change
all
through
his
day
,
be
his
!
 
<EOS>
look
round
upon
these
people
:
 
far
from
home
,
houseless
,
indigent
,
wander
,
weary
with
travel
and
hard
living
:
 
and
see
how
patiently
they
nurse
and
tend
their
young
child
:
 
<EOS>
how
they
consult
ever
their
want
first
,
then
half
supply
their
own
;
what
gentle
minister
of
hope
and
faith
the
woman
be
;
how
the
man
profit
by
their
example
;
and
how
very
,
very
seldom
even
a
moment
's
petulance
or
harsh
complaint
break
out
among
them
:
 
<EOS>
I
feel
a
strong
love
and
honour
of
my
kind
come
glow
on
my
heart
,
and
wish
to
God
there
have
be
many
atheist
in
the
well
part
of
human
nature
there
,
to
read
this
simple
lesson
in
the
book
of
Life
.
   
<EOS>
We
leave
Montreal
for
New
York
again
,
on
the
thirtieth
of
May
,
cross
to
La
Prairie
,
on
the
opposite
shore
of
the
St
Lawrence
,
in
a
steamboat
;
we
then
take
the
railroad
to
St
John
's
,
which
be
on
the
brink
of
Lake
Champlain
.
 
<EOS>
Our
last
greeting
in
Canada
be
from
the
english
officer
in
the
pleasant
barrack
at
that
place
(
a
class
of
gentleman
who
have
make
every
hour
of
our
visit
memorable
by
their
hospitality
and
friendship
)
;
and
with
"
Rule
Britannia
"
sound
in
our
ear
,
soon
leave
it
far
behind
.
   
<EOS>
but
Canada
have
hold
,
and
always
will
retain
,
a
foremost
place
in
my
remembrance
.
 
<EOS>
Few
Englishmen
be
prepared
to
find
it
what
it
be
.
<EOS>
advance
quietly
;
old
difference
settle
down
,
and
be
fast
forget
;
public
feeling
and
private
enterprise
alike
in
a
sound
and
wholesome
state
;
nothing
of
flush
or
fever
in
its
system
,
but
health
and
vigour
throbbing
in
its
steady
pulse
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
full
of
hope
and
promise
.
 
<EOS>
to
me
---
who
have
be
accustom
to
think
of
it
as
something
leave
behind
in
the
stride
of
advance
society
,
as
something
neglect
and
forget
,
slumber
and
waste
in
its
sleep
---
the
demand
for
labour
and
the
rate
of
wage
;
the
busy
quay
of
Montreal
;
the
vessel
take
in
their
cargo
,
and
discharge
them
;
the
amount
of
shipping
in
the
different
port
;
the
commerce
,
road
,
and
public
work
,
all
make
to
last
;
the
respectability
and
character
of
the
public
journal
;
and
the
amount
of
rational
comfort
and
happiness
which
honest
industry
may
earn
:
be
very
great
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
the
steamboat
on
the
lake
,
in
their
convenience
,
cleanliness
,
and
safety
;
in
the
gentlemanly
character
and
bearing
of
their
captain
;
and
in
the
politeness
and
perfect
comfort
of
their
social
regulation
;
be
unsurpassed
even
by
the
famous
Scotch
vessel
,
deservedly
so
much
esteem
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
the
inn
be
usually
bad
;
because
the
custom
of
boarding
at
hotel
be
not
so
general
here
as
in
the
States
,
and
the
british
officer
,
who
form
a
large
portion
of
the
society
of
every
town
,
live
chiefly
at
the
regimental
mess
:
 
but
in
every
other
respect
,
the
traveller
in
Canada
will
find
as
good
provision
for
his
comfort
as
in
any
place
I
know
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
one
american
boat
---
the
vessel
which
carry
us
on
Lake
Champlain
,
from
St
John
's
to
Whitehall
---
which
I
praise
very
highly
,
but
no
more
than
it
deserve
,
when
I
say
that
it
be
superior
even
to
that
in
which
we
go
from
Queenston
to
Toronto
,
or
to
that
in
which
we
travel
from
the
latter
place
to
Kingston
,
or
I
have
no
doubt
I
may
add
to
any
other
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
this
steamboat
,
which
be
call
the
Burlington
,
be
a
perfectly
exquisite
achievement
of
neatness
,
elegance
,
and
order
.
 
<EOS>
the
deck
be
drawing
-
room
;
the
cabin
be
boudoir
,
choicely
furnished
and
adorn
with
print
,
picture
,
and
musical
instrument
;
every
nook
and
corner
in
the
vessel
be
a
perfect
curiosity
of
graceful
comfort
and
beautiful
contrivance
.
 
<EOS>
Captain
Sherman
,
her
commander
,
to
whose
ingenuity
and
excellent
taste
<EOS>
these
result
be
solely
attributable
,
have
bravely
and
worthily
distinguish
himself
on
more
than
one
try
occasion
:
 
not
least
among
them
,
in
have
the
moral
courage
to
carry
british
troop
,
at
a
time
(
during
the
canadian
rebellion
)
when
no
other
conveyance
be
open
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
his
vessel
be
hold
in
universal
respect
,
both
by
his
own
countryman
and
our
;
and
no
man
ever
enjoy
the
popular
esteem
,
who
,
in
his
sphere
of
action
,
win
and
wear
it
better
than
this
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
by
mean
of
this
float
palace
we
be
soon
in
the
United
States
again
,
and
call
that
evening
at
Burlington
;
a
pretty
town
,
where
we
lay
an
hour
or
so
.
 
<EOS>
We
reach
Whitehall
,
where
we
be
to
disembark
,
at
six
next
morning
;
and
may
have
do
so
earlier
,
but
that
these
steamboat
lie
by
for
some
hour
in
the
night
,
in
consequence
of
the
lake
become
very
narrow
at
that
part
of
the
journey
,
and
difficult
of
navigation
in
the
dark
.
 
<EOS>
Its
width
be
so
contract
at
one
point
,
indeed
,
that
they
be
oblige
to
warp
round
by
mean
of
a
rope
.
   
<EOS>
after
breakfast
at
Whitehall
,
we
take
the
stage
-
coach
for
Albany
:
 
a
large
and
busy
town
,
where
we
arrive
between
five
and
six
o'clock
that
afternoon
;
after
a
very
hot
day
's
journey
,
for
we
be
now
in
the
height
of
summer
again
.
 
<EOS>
at
seven
we
start
for
New
York
on
board
a
great
North
River
steamboat
,
which
be
so
crowd
with
passenger
that
the
upper
deck
be
like
the
box
lobby
of
a
theatre
between
the
piece
,
and
the
low
one
like
Tottenham
Court
Road
on
a
Saturday
night
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
sleep
soundly
,
notwithstanding
,
and
soon
after
five
o'clock
next
morning
reach
New
York
.
   
<EOS>
tarry
here
,
only
that
day
and
night
,
to
recruit
after
our
late
fatigue
,
we
start
off
once
more
upon
our
last
journey
in
America
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
yet
five
day
to
spare
before
embark
for
England
,
and
I
have
a
great
desire
to
see
"
the
Shaker
Village
,
"
which
be
people
by
a
religious
sect
from
whom
it
take
its
name
.
   
<EOS>
to
this
end
,
we
go
up
the
North
River
again
,
as
far
as
the
town
of
Hudson
,
and
there
hire
an
extra
to
carry
us
to
Lebanon
,
thirty
mile
distant
:
 
and
of
course
another
and
a
different
Lebanon
from
that
village
where
I
sleep
on
the
night
of
the
Prairie
trip
.
   
<EOS>
the
country
through
which
the
road
meander
,
be
rich

beautiful
;
the
weather
very
fine
;
and
for
many
mile

Kaatskill
mountain
,
where
Rip

and
the
ghostly
Dutchmen
play
at
ninepins
one
memorable
gusty
afternoon
,
tower
in
the
blue
distance

like
stately

<EOS>
at
one
point

as
we
ascend
a
steep
hill
,
athwart
whose
base
a
railroad
,
yet
construct

take
its
course
,
we
come
upon
an

with

it
be
wonderful

the
furniture
of

dark
and
dirty
hut
.
   
<EOS>
between
nine
and
ten
o'clock
at
night
,
we
arrive
at
Lebanon
which
be
renowned
for
its
warm
bath
,
and
for
a
great
hotel
,
well
adapt
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
to
the
gregarious
taste
of
those
seeker
after
health
or
pleasure
who
repair
here
,
but
inexpressibly
comfortless
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
show
into
an
immense
apartment
,
light
by
two
dim
candle
,
call
the
drawing
-
room
:
 
<EOS>
from
which
there
be
a
descent
by
a
flight
of
step
,
to
another
vast
desert
,
call
the
dining
-
room
:
 
<EOS>
our
bed
-
chamber
be
among
certain
long
row
of
little
white
-
washed
cell
,
which
open
from
either
side
of
a
dreary
passage
;
and
be
so
like
room
in
a
prison
that
I
half
expect
to
be
lock
up
when
I
go
to
bed
,
and
listen
involuntarily
for
the
turning
of
the
key
on
the
outside
.
 
<EOS>
there
need
be
bath
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
,
<EOS>
for
the
other
washing
arrangement
be
on
as
limit
a
scale
as
I
ever
see
,
even
in
America
:
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
these
bedroom
be
so
very
bare
of
even
such
common
luxury
as
chair
,
that
I
should
say
they
be
not
provide
with
enough
of
anything
,
but
that
I
bethink
myself
of
our
have
be
most
bountifully
bite
all
night
.
   
<EOS>
the
house
be
very
pleasantly
situate
,
however
,
and
we
have
a
good
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
that
do
,
we
go
to
visit
our
place
of
destination
,
which
be
some
two
mile
off
,
and
the
way
to
which
be
soon
indicate
by
a
finger
-
post
,
whereon
be
paint
,
"
to
the
Shaker
Village
.
"
   
<EOS>
as
we
ride
along
,
we
pass
a
party
of
Shakers
,
who
be
at
work
upon
the
road
;
who
wear
the
broad
of
all
broad
-
brim
hat
;
and
be
in
all
visible
respect
such
very
wooden
man
,
that
I
feel
about
as
much
sympathy
for
them
,
and
as
much
interest
in
them
,
as
if
they
have
be
so
many
figure
-
head
of
ship
.
 
<EOS>
presently
we
come
to
the
beginning
of
the
village
,
and
alight
at
the
door
of
a
house
where
the
Shaker
manufacture
be
sell
,
and
which
be
the
headquarters
of
the
elder
,
request
permission
to
see
the
Shaker
worship
.
   
<EOS>
pende
the
conveyance
of
this
request
to
some
person
in
authority
,
we
walk
into
a
grim
room
,
where
several
grim
hat
be
hang
on
grim
peg
,
and
the
time
be
grimly
tell
by
a
grim
clock
which
utter
every
tick
with
a
kind
of
struggle
,
as
if
it
break
the
grim
silence
reluctantly
,
and
under
protest
.
 
<EOS>
range
against
the
wall
be
six
or
eight
stiff
,
high
-
back
chair
,
and
they
partook
so
strongly
of
the
general
grimness
that
one
would
much
rather
have
sit
on
the
floor
than
incur
the
small
obligation
to
any
of
them
.
   
<EOS>
presently
,
there
stalk
into
this
apartment
,
a
grim
old
Shaker
,
with
eye
as
hard
,
and
dull
,
and
cold
,
as
the
great
round
metal
button
on
his
coat
and
waistcoat
;
a
sort
of
calm
goblin
.
 
<EOS>
be
inform
of
our
desire
,
he
produce
a
newspaper
wherein
the
body
of
elder
,
whereof
he
be
a
member
,
<EOS>
have
advertise
but
a
few
day
before
,
that
in
consequence
of
certain
unseemly
interruption
which
their
worship
have
receive
from
stranger
,
their
chapel
be
close
to
the
public
for
the
space
of
one
year
.
   
<EOS>
as
nothing
be
to
be
urge
in
opposition
to
this
reasonable
arrangement
,
we
request
leave
to
make
some
trifle
purchase
of
Shaker
good
;
which
be
grimly
concede
.
 
<EOS>
We
accordingly
repair
to
a
store
in
the
same
house
and
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
passage
,
where
the
stock
be
preside
over
by
something
alive
in
a
russet
case
,
which
the
elder
say
be
a
woman
;
and
which
I
suppose
be
a
woman
,
though
I
should
not
have
suspect
it
.
   
<EOS>
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
be
their
place
of
worship
:
 
a
cool
,
clean
edifice
of
wood
,
with
large
window
and
green
blind
:
like
a
spacious
summer
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
as
there
be
no
get
into
this
place
,
and
nothing
be
to
be
do
but
walk
up
and
down
,
and
look
at
it
and
the
other
building
in
the
village
(
which
be
chiefly
of
wood
,
paint
a
dark
red
like
english
barn
,
and
compose
of
many
story
like
english
factory
)
,
I
have
nothing
to
communicate
to
the
reader
,
beyond
the
scanty
result
I
glean
the
while
our
purchase
be
make
,
   
these
people
be
call
Shakers
from
their
peculiar
form
of
adoration
,
which
consist
of
a
dance
,
perform
by
the
man
and
woman
of
all
age
,
who
arrange
themselves
for
that
purpose
in
opposite
party
:
 
the
man
first
divest
themselves
of
their
hat
and
coat
,
which
they
gravely
hang
against
the
wall
before
they
begin
;
and
tie
a
ribbon
round
their
shirt
-
sleeve
,
as
though
they
be
go
to
be
bleed
.
 
<EOS>
They
accompany
themselves
with
a
droning
,
hum
noise
,
and
dance
until
they
be
quite
exhausted
,
alternately
advance
and
retire
in
a
preposterous
sort
of
trot
.
<EOS>
the
effect
be
say
to
be
unspeakably
absurd
:
 
and
if
I
may
judge
from
a
print
of
this
ceremony
which
I
have
in
my
possession
;
and
which
I
be
inform
by
those
who
have
visit
the
chapel
,
be
perfectly
accurate
;
it
must
be
infinitely
grotesque
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
govern
by
a
woman
,
and
her
rule
be
understand
to
be
absolute
,
though
she
have
the
assistance
of
a
council
of
elder
.
<EOS>
She
live
,
it
be
say
,
in
strict
seclusion
,
in
certain
room
above
the
chapel
,
and
be
never
show
to
profane
eye
.
 
<EOS>
if
she
at
all
resemble
the
lady
who
preside
over
the
store
,
it
be
a
great
charity
to
keep
her
as
close
as
possible
,
and
I
can
not
too
strongly
express
my
perfect
concurrence
in
this
benevolent
proceeding
.
   
<EOS>
all
the
possession
and
revenue
of
the
settlement
be
throw
into
a
common
stock
,
which
be
manage
by
the
elder
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
have
make
convert
among
people
who
be
well
to
do
in
the
world
,
and
be
frugal
and
thrifty
,
it
be
understand
that
this
fund
prosper
:
 
the
more
especially
as
they
have
make
large
purchase
of
land
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
this
at
Lebanon
the
only
Shaker
settlement
:
 
<EOS>
there
be
,
I
think
,
at
least
,
three
other
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
good
farmer
,
and
all
their
produce
be
eagerly
purchase
and
highly
esteem
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shaker
seed
,
"
"
Shaker
herb
,
"
and
"
Shaker
distil
water
,
"
be
commonly
announce
for
sale
in
the
shop
of
town
and
city
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
good
breeder
of
cattle
,
and
be
kind
and
merciful
to
the
brute
creation
.
 
<EOS>
consequently
,
Shaker
beast
seldom
fail
to
find
a
ready
market
.
   
<EOS>
They
eat
and
drink
together
,
after
the
spartan
model
,
at
a
great
public
table
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
union
of
the
sex
,
and
every
Shaker
,
male
and
female
,
be
devote
to
a
life
of
celibacy
.
 
<EOS>
Rumour
have
be
busy
upon
this
theme
,
but
here
again
I
must
refer
to
the
lady
of
the
store
,
and
say
,
that
if
many
of
the
sister
shaker
resemble
her
,
I
treat
all
such
slander
as
bear
on
its
face
the
strong
mark
of
wild
improbability
.
 
<EOS>
but
that
they
take
as
proselyte
,
person
so
young
that
they
can
not
know
their
own
mind
,
and
can
not
possess
much
strength
of
resolution
in
this
or
any
other
respect
,
I
can
assert
from
my
own
observation
of
the
extreme
juvenility
of
certain
youthful
shaker
whom
I
see
at
work
among
the
party
on
the
road
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
say
to
be
good
driver
of
bargain
,
but
to
be
honest
and
just
in
their
transaction
,
and
even
in
horse
-
dealing
to
resist
those
thievish
tendency
which
would
seem
,
for
some
undiscovered
reason
,
to
be
almost
inseparable
from
that
branch
of
traffic
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
matter
they
hold
their
own
course
quietly
,
live
in
their
gloomy
,
silent
commonwealth
,
and
show
little
desire
to
interfere
with
other
people
.
   
<EOS>
this
be
well
enough
,
but
nevertheless
I
can
not
,
I
confess
,
incline
towards
the
shaker
;
view
them
with
much
favour
,
or
extend
towards
them
any
very
lenient
construction
.
 
<EOS>
I
so
abhor
,
and
from
my
soul
detest
that
bad
spirit
,
<EOS>
no
matter
by
what
class
or
sect
it
may
be
entertain
,
which
would
strip
life
of
its
healthful
grace
,
rob
youth
of
its
innocent
pleasure
,
pluck
from
maturity
and
age
their
pleasant
ornament
,
and
make
existence
but
a
narrow
path
towards
the
grave
:
 
that
odious
spirit
which
,
if
it
could
have
have
full
scope
and
sway
upon
the
earth
,
must
have
blast
and
make
barren
the
imagination
of
the
great
man
,
and
leave
them
,
in
their
power
of
raise
up
endure
image
before
their
fellow
-
creature
yet
unborn
,
no
well
than
the
beast
:
 
that
,
in
these
very
broad
-
brim
hat
and
very
sombre
coat
---
in
stiff
-
necked
,
solemn
-
visaged
piety
,
in
short
,
no
matter
what
its
garb
,
whether
it
have
crop
hair
as
in
a
Shaker
village
,
or
long
nail
as
in
a
Hindoo
temple
---
I
recognise
the
bad
among
the
enemy
of
Heaven
and
Earth
,
who
turn
the
water
at
the
marriage
feast
of
this
poor
world
,
not
into
wine
,
but
gall
.
 
<EOS>
and
if
there
must
be
people
vow
to
crush
the
harmless
fancy
and
the
love
of
innocent
delight
and
gaiety
,
which
be
a
part
of
human
nature
:
 
as
much
a
part
of
it
as
any
other
love
or
hope
that
be
our
common
portion
:
 
<EOS>
let
them
,
for
me
,
stand
openly
reveal
among
the
ribald
and
licentious
;
the
very
idiot
know
that
they
be
not
on
the
Immortal
road
,
and
will
despise
them
,
and
avoid
them
readily
.
   
<EOS>
leave
the
Shaker
village
with
a
hearty
dislike
of
the
old
Shakers
,
and
a
hearty
pity
for
the
young
one
:
 
temper
by
the
strong
probability
of
their
run
away
as
they
grow
old
and
wise
,
which
they
not
uncommonly
do
:
 
<EOS>
we
return
to
Lebanon
,
and
so
to
Hudson
,
by
the
way
we
have
come
upon
the
previous
day
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
we
take
the
steamboat
down
the
North
River
towards
New
York
,
but
stop
,
some
four
hour
'
journey
short
of
it
,
at
West
Point
,
where
we
remain
that
night
,
and
all
next
day
,
and
next
night
too
.
   
<EOS>
in
this
beautiful
place
:
 
the
fair
among
the
fair
and
lovely
Highlands
of
the
North
River
:
 
shut
in
by
deep
green
height
and
ruin
fort
,
and
look
down
upon
the
distant
town
of
Newburgh
,
along
a
glitter
path
of
sunlit
water
,
with
here
and
there
a
skiff
,
whose
white
sail
often
bend
on
some
new
tack
as
sudden
flaw
of
wind
come
down
upon
her
from
the
gully
in
the
hill
:
hem
in

besides
,
all
round
with
memory
of
Washington
,
and
event
of
the
revolutionary
war
:
 
be
the
Military
School
of
America
.
   
<EOS>
It
could
not
stand
on
more
appropriate
ground
,
and
any
ground
more
beautiful
can
hardly
be
.
 
<EOS>
the
course
of
education
be
severe
,
but
well
devised
,
and
manly

<EOS>
through
June
,
July

and
August

the
young

encamp
upon
the
spacious
plain
whereon
the
college
stand

and
all
the

their
military
exercise
be
perform
there
,
daily
.
<EOS>
the
term
of
study
at
this
institution
,
which
the
state
require
from
all
cadet
,
be
four
year
;
but
,
whether
it
be
from
the
rigid
nature
of
the
discipline
,
or
the
national
impatience
of
restraint
,
or
both
cause
combine
,
not
more
than
half
the
number
who
begin
their
study
here

ever
remain
to
finish
them
.
   
<EOS>
the
number
of
cadet
be
about
equal
to
that

<EOS>
the

beautifully
situate

and
there
be
a
most
excellent
hotel
for
stranger

though
it
have
the
two
drawback
of
be
a
total
abstinence
house
(
wine

and
of
serve
the

at
rather
uncomfortable
hour
:
 
to

breakfast
at
seven
,
dinner
at

<EOS>
the

of

in
the
very
dawn
and
greenness
of
summer
<EOS>

it

leave

upon

on

I

among
the
last

Home
 
I
never
have
so
much
interest
before

and
very
likely
I
shall
never
have
so
much
interest
again
,
in
the

as
on
the
long

for

of

<EOS>
some
nautical
authority
have
tell
me
a
day
or
two
previous
,
"
anything
with
west

will
do

"
so
when
I
dart
out

up

be
salute
by
a

I

I

I
dare

to
take
advantage
of
this
favourable
weather
,
and
the
ship
which
yesterday
have
be
in
such
a
crowded
dock
that
she
may
have
retire
from
trade
for
good
and
all
,
for
any
chance
she
seem
to
have
of
go
to
sea
,
be
now
full
sixteen
mile
away
.
 
<EOS>
a
gallant
sight
<EOS>
she
be
,
when
we
,
fast
gain
on
her
in
a
steamboat
,
see
her
in
the
distance
ride
at
anchor
:
 
<EOS>
her
tall
mast
point
up
in
graceful
line
against
the
sky
,
and
every
rope
and
spar
express
in
delicate
and
thread
-
like
outline
:
 
gallant
,
too
,
when
,
we
be
all
aboard
,
the
anchor
come
up
to
the
sturdy
chorus
"
cheerily
man
,
oh
cheerily
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
follow
proudly
in
the
tow
steamboat
's
wake
:
 
but
brave
and
most
gallant
of
all
,
when
the
tow
-
rope
being
cast
adrift
,
the
canvas
flutter
from
her
mast
,
and
spread
her
white
wing
she
soar
away
upon
her
free
and
solitary
course
.
   
<EOS>
in
the
after
cabin
we
be
only
fifteen
passenger
in
all
,
and
the
great
part
be
from
Canada
,
where
some
of
us
have
know
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
the
night
be
rough
and
squally
,
so
be
the
next
two
day
,
but
they
fly
by
quickly
,
and
we
be
soon
as
cheerful
and
snug
a
party
,
with
an
honest
,
manly
-
hearted
captain
at
our
head
,
as
ever
come
to
the
resolution
of
be
mutually
agreeable
,
on
land
or
water
.
   
<EOS>
We
breakfast
at
eight
,
lunch
at
twelve
,
dine
at
three
,
and
take
our
tea
at
half
-
past
seven
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
abundance
of
amusement
,
and
dinner
be
not
the
least
among
them
:
 
firstly
,
for
its
own
sake
;
secondly
,
because
of
its
extraordinary
length
:
 
its
duration
,
inclusive
of
all
the
long
pause
between
the
course
,
be
seldom
less
than
two
hour
and
a
half
;
which
be
a
subject
of
never
-
fail
entertainment
.
 
<EOS>
by
way
of
beguile
the
tediousness
of
these
banquet
,
a
select
association
be
form
at
the
low
end
of
the
table
,
below
the
mast
,
to
whose
distinguished
president
modesty
forbid
me
to
make
any
further
allusion
,
which
,
be
a
very
hilarious
and
jovial
institution
,
be
(
prejudice
apart
)
in
high
favour
with
the
rest
of
the
community
,
and
particularly
with
a
black
steward
,
who
live
for
three
week
in
a
broad
grin
at
the
marvellous
humour
of
these
incorporate
worthy
.
   
<EOS>
then
,
we
have
chess
for
those
who
play
it
,
whist
,
cribbage
,
book
,
backgammon
,
and
shovelboard
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
weather
,
fair
or
foul
,
calm
or
windy
,
we
be
every
one
on
deck
,
walk
up
and
down
in
pair
,
lie
in
the
boat
,
lean
over
the
side
,
or
chat
in
a
lazy
group
together
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
no
lack
of
music
,
for
one
play
the
accordion
,
another
the
violin
,
and
another
<EOS>
(
who
usually
begin
at
six
o'clock
AM
)
<EOS>
the
key
-
bugle
:
 
the
combined
effect
of
which
<EOS>
instrument
,
when
they
all
play
different
tune
in
different
part
of
the
ship
,
at
the
same
time
,
and
within
hearing
of
each
other
,
as
they
sometimes
do
(
everybody
be
intensely
satisfied
with
his
own
performance
)
,
be
sublimely
hideous
.
   
<EOS>
when
all
these
mean
of
entertainment
fail
,
a
sail
would
heave
in
sight
:
 
<EOS>
looming
,
perhaps
,
the
very
spirit
of
a
ship
,
in
the
misty
distance
,
or
pass
us
so
close
that
through
our
glass
we
could
see
the
people
on
her
deck
,
and
easily
make
out
her
name
,
and
whither
she
be
bind
.
 
<EOS>
for
hour
together
we
could
watch
the
dolphin
and
porpoise
as
they
roll
and
leap
and
dive
around
the
vessel
;
or
those
small
creature
ever
on
the
wing
,
the
Mother
Carey
's
chicken
,
which
have
bear
us
company
from
New
York
bay
,
and
for
a
whole
fortnight
flutter
about
the
vessel
's
stern
.
 
<EOS>
for
some
day
we
have
a
dead
calm
,
or
very
light
wind
,
during
which
the
crew
amuse
themselves
with
fishing
,
and
hook
an
unlucky
dolphin
,
who
expire
,
in
all
his
rainbow
colour
,
on
the
deck
:
 
an
event
of
such
importance
in
our
barren
calendar
,
that
afterwards
we
date
from
the
dolphin
,
and
make
the
day
on
which
he
die
,
an
era
.
   
<EOS>
besides
all
this
,
when
we
be
five
or
six
day
out
,
there
begin
to
be
much
talk
of
iceberg
,
of
which
wander
island
an
unusual
number
have
be
see
by
the
vessel
that
have
come
into
New
York
a
day
or
two
before
we
leave
that
port
,
and
of
whose
dangerous
neighbourhood
we
be
warn
by
the
sudden
coldness
of
the
weather
,
and
the
sinking
of
the
mercury
in
the
barometer
.
 
<EOS>
while
these
token
last
,
a
double
look
-
out
be
keep
,
and
many
dismal
tale
be
whisper
after
dark
,
of
ship
that
have
strike
upon
the
ice
and
go
down
in
the
night
;
but
the
wind
oblige
us
to
hold
a
southward
course
,
we
see
none
of
them
,
and
the
weather
soon
grow
bright
and
warm
again
.
   
<EOS>
the
observation
every
day
at
noon
,
and
the
subsequent
working
of
the
vessel
's
course
,
be
,
as
may
be
suppose
,
a
feature
in
our
life
of
paramount
importance
;
nor
be
there
want
(
as
there
never
be
)
sagacious
doubter
of
the
captain
's
calculation
,
who
,
so
soon
as
his
back
be
turn
,
would
,
in
the
absence
of
compass
,
measure
the
chart
with
bit
of
string
,
and
end
of
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
,
and
point
of
snuffer
,
and
clearly
prove
him
to
be
wrong
by
an
odd
thousand
mile
or
so
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
very
edifying
to
see
these
unbeliever
shake
their
head
and
frown
,
and
hear
them
hold
forth
strongly
upon
navigation
:
 
not
that
they
know
anything
about
it
,
but
that
they
always
mistrust
the
captain
in
calm
weather
,
or
when
the
wind
be
adverse
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
the
mercury
itself
be
not
so
variable
as
this
class
of
passenger
,
whom
you
will
see
,
when
the
ship
be
go
nobly
through
the
water
,
quite
pale
with
admiration
,
swear
that
the
captain
beat
all
captain
ever
know
,
and
even
hint
at
subscription
for
a
piece
of
plate
;
and
who
,
next
morning
,
when
the
breeze
have
lull
,
and
all
the
sail
hang
useless
in
the
idle
air
,
shake
their
despondent
head
again
,
and
say
,
with
screw
-
up
lip
<EOS>
,
they
hope
that
captain
be
a
sailor
---
but
they
shrewdly
doubt
him
.
   
<EOS>
It
even
become
an
occupation
in
the
calm
,
to
wonder
when
the
wind
WOULD
spring
up
in
the
favourable
quarter
,
where
,
it
be
clearly
show
by
all
the
rule
and
precedent
,
it
ought
to
have
spring
up
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
the
first
mate
,
who
whistle
for
it
zealously
,
be
much
respect
for
his
perseverance
,
and
be
regard
even
by
the
unbeliever
as
a
first
-
rate
sailor
.
 
<EOS>
many
gloomy
look
would
be
cast
upward
through
the
cabin
skylight
at
the
flap
sail
while
dinner
be
in
progress
;
and
some
,
grow
bold
in
ruefulness
,
predict
that
we
should
land
about
the
middle
of
July
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
always
on
board
ship
,
a
Sanguine
One
,
and
a
Despondent
One
.
 
<EOS>
the
latter
character
carry
it
hollow
at
this
period
of
the
voyage
,
and
triumph
over
the
Sanguine
One
at
every
meal
,
by
inquire
where
he
suppose
the
Great
Western
(
which
leave
New
York
a
week
after
us
)
<EOS>
be
now
:
 
and
where
he
suppose
the
"
Cunard
"
steam
-
packet
be
now
:
 
and
what
he
think
of
sailing
vessel
,
as
compare
with
steamship
now
:
 
and
so
beset
his
life
with
pestilent
attack
of
that
kind
,
that
he
too
be
oblige
to
affect
despondency
,
for
very
peace
and
quietude
.
   
<EOS>
these
be
addition
to
the
list
of
entertaining
incident
,
but
there
be
still
another
source
of
interest
.
 
<EOS>
We
carry
in
the
steerage
nearly
a
hundred
passenger
:
 
a
little
world
of
poverty
:
<EOS>
and
as
we
come
to
know
individual
among
them
by
sight
,
from
look
down
upon
the
deck
where
they
take
the
air
in
the
daytime
,
and
cook
their
food
,
and
very
often
eat
it
too
,
we
become
curious
to
know
their
history
,
and
with
what
expectation
they
have
go
out
to
America
,
and
on
what
errand
they
be
go
home
,
and
what
their
circumstance
be
.
 
<EOS>
the
information
we
get
on
these
head
from
the
carpenter
,
who
have
charge
of
these
people
,
be
often
of
the
strange
kind
.
 
<EOS>
some
of
them
have
be
in
America
but
three
day
,
some
but
three
month
,
and
some
have
go
out
in
the
last
voyage
of
that
very
ship
in
which
they
be
now
return
home
.
<EOS>
other
have
sell
their
clothe
to
raise
the
passage
-
money
,
and
have
hardly
rag
to
cover
them
;
other
have
no
food
,
and
live
upon
the
charity
of
the
rest
:
 
and
one
man
,
it
be
discover
nearly
at
the
end
of
the
voyage
,
not
before
---
for
he
keep
his
secret
close
,
and
do
not
court
compassion
---
have
have
no
sustenance
<EOS>
whatever
but
the
bone
and
scrap
of
fat
he
take
from
the
plate
use
in
the
after
-
cabin
dinner
,
when
they
be
put
out
to
be
wash
.
   
<EOS>
the
whole
system
of
shipping
and
convey
these
unfortunate
person
,
be
one
that
stand
in
need
of
thorough
revision
.
 
<EOS>
if
any
class
deserve
to
be
protect
and
assist
by
the
Government
,
it
be
that
class
who
be
banish
from
their
native
land
in
search
of
the
bare
mean
of
subsistence
.
 
<EOS>
all
that
could
be
do
for
these
poor
people
by
the
great
compassion
and
humanity
of
the
captain
and
officer
be
do
,
but
they
require
much
more
.
 
<EOS>
the
law
be
bind
,
at
least
upon
the
english
side
,
to
see
that
too
many
of
them
be
not
put
on
board
one
ship
:
 
and
that
their
accommodation
be
decent
:
 
not
demoralise
,
and
profligate
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
bind
,
too
,
in
common
humanity
,
to
declare
that
no
man
shall
be
take
on
board
without
his
stock
of
provision
be
previously
inspect
by
some
proper
officer
,
and
pronounce
moderately
sufficient
for
his
support
upon
the
voyage
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
bind
to
provide
,
or
to
require
that
there
be
provide
,
a
medical
attendant
;
whereas
in
these
ship
there
be
none
,
though
sickness
of
adult
,
and
death
of
child
,
on
the
passage
,
be
matter
of
the
very
common
occurrence
.
<EOS>
above
all
it
be
the
duty
of
any
Government
,
be
it
monarchy
or
republic
,
to
interpose
and
put
an
end
to
that
system
by
which
a
firm
of
trader
in
emigrant
purchase
of
the
owner
the
whole
'
tween
-
deck
of
a
ship
,
and
send
on
board
as
many
wretched
people
as
they
can
lay
hold
of
,
on
any
term
they
can
get
,
without
the
small
reference
to
the
convenience
of
the
steerage
,
the
number
of
berth
,
the
slight
separation
of
the
sex
,
or
anything
but
their
own
immediate
profit
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
even
this
the
bad
of
the
vicious
system
:
 
for
,
certain
crimp
agent
of
these
house
,
who
have
a
percentage
on
all
the
passenger
they
inveigle
,
be
constantly
travel
about
those
district
where
poverty
and
discontent
be
rife
,
and
tempt
the
credulous
into
more
misery
,
by
hold
out
monstrous
inducement
to
emigration
which
can
never
be
realise
.
   
<EOS>
the
history
of
every
family
we
have
on
board
be
pretty
much
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
after
hoard
up
,
and
borrowing
,
and
beg
,
and
sell
everything
to
pay
the
passage
,
they
have
go
out
to
New
York
,
expect
to
find
its
street
pave
with
gold
;
and
have
find
them
pave
with
very
hard
and
very
real
stone
.
 
<EOS>
enterprise
be
dull
;
labourer
be
not
want
;
job
of

be
to

but
the

not

<EOS>
They
be
come
back
,
even
poor
than
they
go

<EOS>
one
of
them
be
carry
an
open
letter
from
a
young
English
artisan

who
have
be
in
New

a

AT

<EOS>
I
haven't
<EOS>
quite
MADE
up
<EOS>
my

<EOS>
whether

be
a
carpenter

<EOS>
a
tailor

"
   
<EOS>
there
be
yet
another
kind
of
passenger
,
and
<EOS>
but
one
more
,
who
,
in
the
calm
and
the
light
wind
,
be
a
constant
theme
of
conversation
and
observation
among
us
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
an
english
sailor
,
a
smart
,
thorough
-
build
,
english
man
-
of
-
war's
-
man
from
his
hat
to
his
shoe
,
who
be
serve
in
the
american
navy
,
and
have
get
leave
of
absence
be
on
his
way
home
to
see
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
present
himself
to
take
and
pay
for
his
passage
,
it
have
be
suggest
to
him
that
be
an
able
seaman
he
may
as
well
work
it
and
save
the
money
,
but
this
piece
of
advice
he
very
indignantly
reject
:
say
,
"
He
would
be
damn
but
for
once
he
would
go
aboard
ship
,
as
a
gentleman
.
"
 
<EOS>
accordingly
,
they
take
his
money
,
but
he
no
sooner
come
aboard
,
than
he
stow
his
kit
in
the
forecastle
,
arrange
to
mess
with
the
crew
,
and
the
very
first
time
the
hand
be
turn
up
,
go
aloft
like
a
cat

before
anybody

<EOS>
and
all
through
the
passage
there
he
be
,
first
at
the
brace
,
outermost
on
the
yard
,
perpetually
lend
a
hand
everywhere
,
but
always
with
a
sober
dignity
in

manner

and
a
sober
grin
on

which
plainly
say
,
"
I
do
it
as
a
gentleman

<EOS>
for
my

mind
you

"
   
<EOS>
at
length
and
at
last
,
the
promise
wind
come
up
in
right
good
earnest
,
and
away
we
go
before
it
,
with
every
stitch
of
canvas
set
,
slash
through
the
water
nobly
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
grandeur
in
the
motion
of
the
splendid
ship
,
as
overshadow
by
her
mass
of
sail
,
she
ride
at
a
furious
pace
upon
the
wave
,
which
fill
one
with
an
indescribable
sense
of
pride
and
exultation
.
 
<EOS>
as
she
plunge
into
a
foam
valley
,
how
I
love
to
see
the
green
wave
,
border
deep
with
white
,
come
rush
on
astern
,
to
buoy
her
upward
at
their
pleasure
,
and
curl
about
her
as
she
stoop
again
,
but
always
own
her
for
their
haughty
mistress
still
!
 
<EOS>
on
,
on
we
fly
,
with
change
light
upon
the
water
,
be
now
in
the
blessed
region
of
fleecy
sky
;
a
bright
sun
light
us
by
day
,
and
a
bright
moon
by
night
;
the
vane
point
directly
homeward
,
alike
the
truthful
index
to
the
favour
wind
and
to
our
cheerful
heart
;
until
at
sunrise
,
one
fair
Monday
morning
---
the
twenty
-
seventh
of
June
,
I
shall
not
easily
forget
the
day
---
there
lie
before
us
,
old
Cape
Clear
,
God
bless
it
,
show
,
in
the
mist
of
early
morning
,
like
a
cloud
:
 
the
bright
and
most
welcome
cloud
,
to
us
,
that
ever
hide
the
face
of
Heaven
's
fall
sister
---
home
.
   
<EOS>
dim
speck
as
it
be
in
the
wide
prospect
<EOS>
,
it
make
the
sunrise
a
more
cheerful
sight
,
and
give
to
it
that
sort
of
human
interest
which
it
seem
to
want
at
sea
.
 
<EOS>
there
,
as
elsewhere
,
the
return
of
day
be
inseparable
from
some
sense
of
renew
hope
and
gladness
;
but
the
light
shine
on
the
dreary
waste
of
water
,
and
show
it
in
all
its
vast
extent
of
loneliness
,
present
a
solemn
spectacle
,
which
even
night
,
veil
it
in
darkness
and
uncertainty
,
do
not
surpass
.
 
<EOS>
the
rise
of
the
moon
be
more
in
keeping
with
the
solitary
ocean
;
and
have
an
air
of
melancholy
grandeur
,
which
in
its
soft
and
gentle
influence
,
seem
to
comfort
while
it
sadden
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
when
I
be
a
very
young
child
have
a
fancy
that
the
reflection
of
the
moon
in
water
be
a
path
to
Heaven
,
trodden
by
the
spirit
of
good
people
on
their
way
to
God
;
and
this
old
feeling
often
come
over
me
again
,
when
I
watch
it
on
a
tranquil
night
at
sea
.
   
<EOS>
the
wind
be
very
light
on
this
same
Monday
morning
,
but
it
be
still
in
the
right
quarter
,
and
so
,
by
slow
degree
,
we
leave
Cape
Clear
behind
,
and
sail
along
within
sight
of
the
coast
of
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
and
how
merry
we
all
be
,
and
how
loyal
to
the
George
Washington
,
and
how
full
of
mutual
congratulation
,
and
how
venturesome
in
predict
the
exact
hour
at
which
we
should
arrive
at
Liverpool
,
may
be
easily
imagine
and
readily
understand
.
 
<EOS>
also
,
how
heartily
we
drink
the
captain
's
health
that
day
at
dinner
;
and
how
restless
we
become
about
pack
up
:
 
and
how
two
or
three
of
the
most
sanguine
spirit
reject
the
idea
of
go
to
bed
at
all
that
night
as
something
it
be
not
worth
while
to
do
,
so
near
the
shore
,
but
go
nevertheless
,
and
sleep
soundly
;
and
how
to
be
so
near
our
journey
's
end
,
be
like
a
pleasant
dream
,
from
which
one
fear
to
wake
.
   
<EOS>
the
friendly
breeze
freshen
again
next
day
,
and
on
we
go
once
more
before
it
gallantly
:
 
descry
now
and
then
an
english
ship
go
homeward
under
shorten
sail
,
while
we
,
with
every
inch
of
canvas
crowd
on
,
dash
gaily
past
,
and
leave
her
far
behind
.
<EOS>
towards
evening
,
the
weather
turn
hazy
,
with
a
drizzling
rain
;
and
soon
become
so
thick
,
that
we
sail
,
as
it
be
,
in
a
cloud
.
<EOS>
still
we
sweep
onward
like
a
phantom
ship
,
and
many
an
eager
eye
glance
up
to
where
the
look
-
out
on
the
mast
keep
watch
for
Holyhead
.
   
<EOS>
at
length
his
long
-
expect
cry
be
hear
,
and
at
the
same
moment
there
shine
out
from
the
haze
and
mist
ahead
,
a
gleaming
light
,
which
presently
be
go
,
and
soon
return
,
and
soon
be
go
again
.
 
<EOS>
whenever
it
come
back
,
the
eye
of
all
on
board
,
brighten
and
sparkle
like
itself
:
 
<EOS>
and
there
we
all
stand
,
watch
this
revolving
light
upon
the
rock
at
Holyhead
,
and
praise
it
for
its
brightness
and
its
friendly
warning
,
and
laud
it
,
in
short
,
above
all
other
signal
light
that
ever
be
display
,
until
it
once
more
glimmer
faintly
in
the
distance
,
far
behind
us
.
   
<EOS>
then
,
it
be
time
to
fire
a
gun
,
for
a
pilot
;
and
almost
before
its
smoke
have
clear
away
,
a
little
boat
with
a
light
at
her
masthead
come
bear
down
upon
us
,
through
the
darkness
,
swiftly
.
 
<EOS>
and
presently
,
our
sail
be
back
,
she
run
alongside
;
and
the
hoarse
pilot
,
wrap
and
muffle
in
pea
-
coat
and
shawl
to
the
very
bridge
of
his
weather
-
plough
-
up
nose
,
stand
bodily
among
us
on
the
deck
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
think
if
that
pilot
have
want
to
borrow
fifty
pound
for
an
indefinite
period
on
no
security
,
we
should
have
engage
to
lend
it
to
him
,
among
us
,
before
his
boat
have
drop
astern
,
or
(
which
be
the
same
thing
)
before
every
scrap
of
news
in
the
paper
he
bring
with
him
have
become
the
common
property
of
all
on
board
.
   
<EOS>
We
turn
in
pretty
late
that
night
,
and
turn
out
pretty
early
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
by
six
o'clock
we
cluster
on
the
deck
,
prepare
to
go
ashore
;
and
look
upon
the
spire
,
and
roof
,
and
smoke
,
of
Liverpool
.
 
<EOS>
by
eight
we
all
sit
down
in
one
of
its
Hotels
,
to
eat
and
drink
together
for
the
last
time
.
 
<EOS>
and
by
nine
we
have
shake
hand
all
round
,
and
break
up
our
social
company
for
ever
.
   
<EOS>
the
country
,
by
the
railroad
,
seem
,
as
we
rattle
through
it
,
like
a
luxuriant
garden
.
 
<EOS>
the
beauty
of
the
field
(
so
small
they
look

,
the
hedge

and
the

the
pretty

the

the

<EOS>
slavery
 
<EOS>
the
upholder
of
slavery
in
America
---
of
the
atrocity
of
which
system
,
I
shall
not
write
one
word
for
which
I
have
not
have
ample
proof
and
warrant
---
may
be
divide
into
three
great
class
.
   
<EOS>
the
first
,
be
those
more
moderate
and
rational
owner
of
human
cattle
,
who
have
come
into
the
possession
of
them
as
so
many
coin
in
their
trading
capital
,
but
who
admit
the
frightful
nature
of
the
Institution
in
the
abstract
,
and
perceive
the
danger
to
society
with
which
it
be
fraught
:
 
danger
which
however
distant
they
may
be
,
or
howsoever
tardy
in
their
come
on
,
be
as
certain
to
fall
upon
its
guilty
head
,
as
be
the
Day
of
Judgment
.
   
<EOS>
the
second
,
consist
of
all
those
owner
,
breeder
,
user
,
buyer
and
seller
of
slave
,
who
will
,
until
the
bloody
chapter
have
a
bloody
end
,
own
,
breed
,
use
,
buy
,
and
sell
them
at
all
hazard
:
who
doggedly
deny
the
horror
of
the
system
in
the
tooth
of
such
a
mass
of
evidence
as
never
be
bring
to
bear
on
any
other
subject
,
and
to
which
the
experience
of
every
day
contribute
its
immense
amount
;
who
would
at
this
or
any
other
moment
,
gladly
involve
America
in
a
war
,
civil
or
foreign
,
provide
that
it
have
for
its
sole
end
and
object
the
assertion
of
their
right
to
perpetuate
slavery
,
and
to
whip
and
work
and
torture
slave
,
unquestione
by
any
human
authority
,
and
unassaile
by
any
human
power
;
who
,
when
they
speak
of
Freedom
,
mean
the
Freedom
to
oppress
their
kind
,
and
to
be
savage
,
merciless
,
and
cruel
;
and
of
whom
every
man
on
his
own
ground
,
in
republican
America
,
be
a
more
exacting
,
and
a
sterner
,
and
a
less
responsible
despot
than
the
Caliph
Haroun
Alraschid
in
his
angry
robe
of
scarlet
.
   
<EOS>
the
third
,
and
not
the
least
numerous
or
influential
,
be
compose
of
all
that
delicate
gentility
which
can
not
bear
a
superior
,
and
can
not
brook
an
equal
;
of
that
class
whose
Republicanism
mean
,
"
I
will
not
tolerate
a
man
above
me
:
 
and
of
those
below
,
none
must
approach
too
near
;
"
whose
pride
,
in
a
land
where
voluntary
servitude
be
shun
as
a
disgrace
,
must
be
minister
to
by
slave
;
and
whose
inalienable
right
can
only
have
their
growth
in
negro
wrong
.
   
<EOS>
It
have
be
sometimes
urge
that
,
in
the
unavaile
effort
which
have
be
make
to
advance
the
cause
of
Human
Freedom
in
the
republic
of
America
(
strange
cause
for
history
to
treat
of
!
)
,
sufficient
regard
have
not
be
have
to
the
existence
of
the
first
class
of
person
;
and
it
have
be
contend
that
they
be
hardly
use
,
in
be
confound
with
the
second
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
,
no
doubt
,
the
case
;
noble
instance
of
pecuniary
and
personal
sacrifice
have
already
have
their
growth
among
them
;
and
it
be
much
to
be
regret
that
the
gulf
between
them
and
the
advocate
of
emancipation
should
have
be
widen
and
deepen
by
any
mean
:
 
<EOS>
the
rather
,
as
there
be
,
beyond
dispute
,
among
these
slave
-
owner
,
many
kind
master
who
be
tender
in
the
exercise
of
their
unnatural
power
.
 
<EOS>
still
,
it
be
to
be
fear
that
this
injustice
be
inseparable
from
the
state
of
thing
with
which
humanity
and
truth
be
call
upon
to
deal
.
<EOS>
slavery
be
not
a
whit
the
more
endurable
because
some
heart
be
to
be
find
which
can
partially
resist
its
harden
influence
;
nor
can
the
indignant
tide
of
honest
wrath
stand
still
,
because
in
its
onward
course
it
overwhelm
a
few
who
be
comparatively
innocent
,
among
a
host
of
guilty
.
   
<EOS>
the
ground
most
commonly
take
by
these
well
man
among
the
advocate
of
slavery
,
be
this
:
 
"
It
be
a
bad
system
;
and
for
myself
I
would
willingly
get
rid
of
it
,
if
I
could
;
most
willingly
.
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
so
bad
,
as
you
in
England
take
it
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
deceive
by
the
representation
of
the
emancipationist
.
 
<EOS>
the
great
part
of
my
slave
be
much
attach
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
say
that
I
do
not
allow
them
to
be
severely
treat
;
but
I
will
put
it
to
you
whether
you
believe
that
it
can
be
a
general
practice
to
treat
them
inhumanly
,
when
it
would
impair
their
value
,
and
would
be
obviously
against
the
interest
of
their
master
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
be
it
the
interest
of
any
man
to
steal
,
to
game
,
to
waste
his
health
and
mental
faculty
by
drunkenness
,
to
lie
,
forswear
himself
,
indulge
hatred
,
seek
desperate
revenge
,
or
do
murder
?
 
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
all
these
be
road
to
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
and
why
,
then
,
do
man
tread
them
?
<EOS>
because
such
inclination
be
among
the
vicious
quality
of
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
Blot
out
,
ye
friend
of
slavery
,
from
the
catalogue
of
human
passion
,
brutal
lust
,
cruelty
,
and
the
abuse
of
irresponsible
power
(
of
all
earthly
temptation
the
most
difficult
to
be
resist
)
,
and
when
ye
have
do
so
,
and
not
before
,
we
will
inquire
whether
it
be
the
interest
of
a
master
to
lash
and
maim
the
slave
,
over
whose
life
and
limb
he
have
an
absolute
control
!
   
<EOS>
but
again
:
 
<EOS>
this
class
,
together
with
that
last
one
I
have
name
,
the
miserable
aristocracy
spawn
of
a
false
republic

lift
up
their
voice

such
cruelty

<EOS>
public

public

about
his

in
broad
unblushing

within

a

alive

it

worth

inquire
how
the

great
number

belong

defer
to

not

to
each

;
how
they

restrain

what

whether

that

,
I

the

in

immediately
at
hand
,
where

the
strong

We

the
particular
of
a

between

the

<EOS>
if
the

will
picture
to
himself
the
kind
of
Board
of
Honour
which
amicably
adjust
the
difference
between
these
two
little
boy
,
who
in
any
other
part
of
the
world
would
have
be
amicably
adjust
on
two
porter

soundly
flog
with
birchen

he
will
be
possess

no

with
as
strong
a
sense
of
its
ludicrous
character
,
as
that
which
set
me
laugh
whenever
its
image
rise
up
before
me
.
   
<EOS>
now
,
I
appeal
to
every
human
mind
,
imbue
with
the
commonest
of
common
sense
,
and
the
commonest
of
common
humanity
;
to
all
dispassionate
,
reason
creature
,
of
any
shade
of
opinion
;
and
ask
,
with
these
revolt
evidence
of
the
state
of
society
which
exist
in
and
about
the
slave
district
of
America
before
them
,
can
they
have
a
doubt
of
the
real
condition
of
the
slave
,
or
can
they
for
a
moment
make
a
compromise
between
the
institution
or
any
of
its
flagrant
,
fearful
feature
,
and
their
own
just
conscience
?
<EOS>
Will
they
say
of
any
tale
of
cruelty
and
horror
,
however
aggravate
in
degree
,
that
it
be
improbable
,
when
they
can
turn
to
the
public

,
and
,
run
,
read
such
sign
as
these
,
lay
before
them
by
the
man
who
rule
the
slave
:
 
in
their
own
act
and
under
their
own
hand
?
   
<EOS>
do
we
not
know
that
the
bad
deformity
and
ugliness
of
slavery
be
at

the
cause
and
the
effect
of
the
reckless
license
take
by
these
freeborn
outlaw
?
 
<EOS>
do
we
not

that
the
man
who
have
be
bear
and
breed
among
its
wrong
;
who
have
see
in

husband
oblige
at

word
of
command
to
flog

indecently
compel

drive

in
their
time
of
travail
,
and
become
mother
on
the
field
of
toil
,
under
the
very
lash
itself
;
who

read

and
see
his
virgin
sister
read
,
description
of
runaway
man
and
woman
,
and
their
disfigured
person

which
could
not
be
publish
elsewhere
,
of
so
much
stock
upon
a
farm
,
or
at

show
of

:
---
<EOS>
do

will
be

do

stalk

his

will
shoot

<EOS>
and
if
our

do
not
teach
us
this
and
much
beyond

if
we
be
such
idiot
as
to
close
our

to
that
fine
mode
of
training
which
rear
up
such

should

in

on

<EOS>
what

shall
we
declaim
against
the
ignorant
peasantry
of
Ireland
,
and
mince
the
matter
when
these
american
taskmaster
be

<EOS>
Shall
we
cry
shame
on
the
brutality
of
those
who
hamstring
cattle
:
 
and
spare
the
light
of
Freedom
upon
earth
who
notch
the
ear
of

write
with

hot

rack
their

for
livery
of
mutilation
which
their

shall
wear
for

carry

grave
,
break

who
mock

slay
the
Saviour
of

,
and
set
defenceless

<EOS>
Shall

Shall

exult
above

scatter
remnant

race

and
triumph
in
the
white
enjoyment
of
their
possession
?
 
<EOS>
rather
,
for
me
,
restore
the
forest
and
the
indian
village
;
in
lieu
of
star
and
stripe
,
let
some
poor
feather
flutter
in
the
breeze
;
replace
the
street
and
square
by
wigwam
;
and
though
the
death
-
song
of
a
hundred
haughty
warrior
fill
the
air
,
it
will
be
music
to
the
shriek
of
one
unhappy
slave

on
one
theme
,
which
be
commonly

in
respect

which
our
national
character
be
change
fast

let
the
plain
Truth
be
speak

let
us
not

like
dastard

beat
about
the

by
hint
at

fierce
Italian

We

<EOS>
conclude
Remarks
 
<EOS>
there
be
many
passage
in
this
book
,
where
I
have
be
at
some
pain
to
resist
the
temptation
of
trouble
my
reader
with
my
own
deduction
and
conclusion
:
 
<EOS>
prefer
that
they
should
judge
for
themselves
,
from
such
premise
as
I
have
lay
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
My
only
object
in
the
outset
,
be
,
to
carry
them
with
me
<EOS>
faithfully
wheresoever
<EOS>
I
go
:
 
and
<EOS>
that
task
I
have
discharge
.
   
<EOS>
but
I
may
be
pardon
,
if
on
such
a
theme
as
the
general
character
of
the
american
people
,
and
the
general
character
of
their
social
system
,
as
present
to
a
stranger
's
eye
<EOS>
,
I
desire
to
express
my
own
opinion
in
a
few
word
,
before
I
bring
these
volume
to
a
close
.
   
<EOS>
They
be
,
by
nature
,
frank
,
brave
,
cordial
,
hospitable
,
and
affectionate
.
 
<EOS>
cultivation
and
refinement
seem
but
to
enhance
their
warmth
of
heart
and
ardent
enthusiasm
;
and
it
be
the
possession
of
these
latter
quality
in
a
most
remarkable
degree
,
which
render
an
educate
american
one
of
the
most
endearing
and
most
generous
of
friend
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
be
so
win
upon
,
as
by
this
class
;
never
yield
up
my
full
confidence
and
esteem
so
readily
and
pleasurably
,
as
to
them
;
never
can
make
again
,
in
half
a
year
,
so
many
friend
for
whom
I
seem
to
entertain
the
regard
of
half
a
life
.
   
<EOS>
these
quality
be
natural
,
I
implicitly
believe
,
to
the
whole
people
.
 
<EOS>
that
they
be
,
however
,
sadly
sap
and
blight
in
their
growth
among
the
mass
;
and
that
there
be
influence
at
work
which
endanger
them
still
more
,
and
give
but
little
present
promise
of
their
healthy
restoration
;
be
a
truth
that
ought
to
be
tell
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
an
essential
part
of
every
national
character
to
pique
itself
mightily
upon
its
fault
,
and
to
deduce
token
of
its
virtue
or
its
wisdom
from
their
very
exaggeration
.
 
<EOS>
one
great
blemish
in
the
popular
mind
of
America
,
and
the
prolific
parent
of
an
innumerable
brood
of
evil
,
be
Universal
Distrust
.
 
<EOS>
yet
the
american
citizen
plume
himself
upon
this
spirit
,
even
when
he
be
sufficiently
dispassionate
to
perceive
the
ruin
it
work
;
and
will
often
adduce
it
,
in
spite
of
his
own
reason
,
as
an
instance
of
the
great
sagacity
and
acuteness
of
the
people
,
and
their
superior
shrewdness
and
independence
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
carry
,
"
say
the
stranger
,
"
this
jealousy
and
distrust
into
every
transaction
of
public
life
.
 
<EOS>
by
repel
worthy
man
from
your
legislative
assembly
,
it
have
breed
up
a
class
of
candidate
for
the
suffrage
,
who
,
in
their
very
act
,
disgrace
your
institution
and
your
people
's
choice
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
render
you
so
fickle
,
and
so
give
to
change
,
that
your
inconstancy
have
pass
into
a
proverb
;
for
you
no
sooner
set
up
an
idol
firmly
,
than
you
be
sure
to
pull
it
down
and
dash
it
into
fragment
:
 
and
this
,
<EOS>
because
directly
you
reward
a
benefactor
,
or
a
public
servant
,
you
distrust
him
,
merely
because
he
be
reward
;
and
immediately
apply
yourself
to
find
out
,
either
that
you
have
be
too
bountiful
in
your
acknowledgment
,
or
he
remis
in
his
desert
.
 
<EOS>
any
man
who
attain
a
high
place
among
you
,
from
the
President
downwards
,
may
date
his
downfall
from
that
moment
;
for
any
print
lie
that
any
notorious
villain
pen
,
although
it
militate
directly
against
the
character
and
conduct
of
a
life
,
appeal
at
once
to
your
distrust
,
and
be
believe
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
strain
at
a
gnat
in
the
way
of
trustfulness
and
confidence
,
however
fairly
win
and
well
deserved
;
but
you
will
swallow
a
whole
caravan
of
camel
,
if
they
be
laden
with
unworthy
doubt
and
mean
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
be
this
well
,
think
you
,
or
likely
to
elevate
the
character
of
the
governor
or
the
govern
,
among
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
the
answer
be
invariably
the
same
:
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
freedom
of
opinion
here
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
every
man
think
for
himself
,
and
we
be
not
to
be
easily
overreach
.
 
<EOS>
that
be
how
our
people
come
to
be
suspicious
.
"
   
<EOS>
another
prominent
feature
be
the
love
of
"
smart
"
deal
:
 
which
gild
over
many
a
swindle
and
gross
breach
of
trust
;
many
a
defalcation
,
public
and
private
;
and
enable
many
a
knave
to
hold
his
head
up
with
the
good
,
who
well
deserve
a
halter
;
though
it
have
not
be
without
its
retributive
operation
,
for
this
smartness
have
do
more
in
a
few
year
to
impair
the
public
credit
,
and
to
cripple
the
public
resource
,
than
dull
honesty
,
however
rash
,
could
have
effect
in
a
century
.
 
<EOS>
the
merit
of
a
broken
speculation
,
or
a
bankruptcy
,
or
of
a
successful
scoundrel
,
be
not
gauge
by
its
or
his
observance
of
the
golden
rule
,
"
do
as
you
would
be
do
by
,
"
but
be
consider
with
reference
to
their
smartness
.
 
<EOS>
I
recollect
,
on
both
occasion
of
our
pass
that
ill
-
fate
Cairo
on
the
Mississippi
,
remark
on
the
bad
effect
such
gross
deceit
must
have
when
they
explode
,
in
generate
a
want
of
confidence
abroad
,
and
discourage
foreign
investment
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
be
give
to
understand
that
this
be
a
very
smart
scheme
by
which
a
deal
of
money
have
be
make
:
 
and
that
its
smart
feature
be
,
that
they
forget
these
thing
abroad
,
in
a
very
short
time
,
and
speculate
again
,
as
freely
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
the
following
dialogue
<EOS>
I
have
hold
a
hundred
time
:
 
<EOS>
"
be
it
not
a
very
disgraceful
circumstance
that
such
a
man
as
so
-
and
-
so
should
be
acquire
a
large
property
by
the
most
infamous
and
odious
mean
,
and
notwithstanding
all
the
crime
of
which
he
have
be
guilty
,
should
be
tolerate
and
abet
by
your
Citizens
?
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
public
nuisance
,
be
he
not
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes

"
 
"
a
convict
liar
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes

<EOS>
"
He
have
be
kick

and
cuff
,
and
cane
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
he
be
utterly
dishonourable
,
debased
,
and
profligate
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
yes
,
sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
in
the
name
of
wonder
,
then
,
what
be
his
merit
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
sir
,
he
be
a
smart
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
in
like
manner
,
all
kind
of
deficient
and
impolitic
usage

<EOS>
the

be
assign
as
a
reason
for
that
comfortless
custom

so
very
prevalent
in
country

of

at

<EOS>
the
love
of

be
a
reason
why
the
literature
of
America
be
to
remain
for
ever
unprotecte
"
for
we
be
a
trading
people

and
do
not

for
poetry

<EOS>
though
we
do

by

very
proud
of

while
healthful
amusement

these

present
at

full
in
the

<EOS>
but
,
the
foul
growth
of
America
have
a
more
tangled
root
than
this

it
strike
its

deep
in

high

it

the

<EOS>
among
the

there
be
some

the

one
opinion
,
in
reference
to
the
vicious
character
of
these
infamous
journal

<EOS>
It
be
sometimes
contend
---
I
will
not
say
strangely
,
for
it
be
natural
to
seek
excuse
for
such
a
disgrace
---
that
their
influence
be
not
so
great
as
a
visitor
would
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
be
pardon
for
say
that
there
be
no
warrant
for
this
plea

and
that
every
fact

circumstance
tend
directly
to
the
opposite
conclusion

<EOS>
when
any
man

of
any
grade
of
desert
in
intellect
or
character

can
climb
to
any
public
distinction
,
no
matter
what
,
in
America
,
without
first
grovel
down
upon
the
earth
,
and
bend
the
knee
before
this
monster
of
depravity
;
when
any
private
excellence
be
safe
from
its
attack
;
when
any
social
confidence
be
leave
unbroken
by
it
,
or
any
tie
of
social
decency
and
honour
be
hold
in
the
least
regard

when
any
man
in
that

have
freedom
of
opinion

and
presume
to
think
for
himself

and
speak
for
himself

without
humble

a
censorship
which
,
for
its
rampant
ignorance
and
base
dishonesty
,
he
utterly
loathe
and
despise
in
his
heart
;
when
those
who
most
acutely
feel
its
infamy
and
the
reproach
it
cast
upon
the
nation
,
and
who
most
denounce
it

dare
to
set
their
heel
upon

crush
it
openly

in

then
,
I
will
believe
that
its

be
lessen

<EOS>
but
while
that
Press
have
its
evil
eye
in

and
its
black
hand
in
every

in

from

while
,
with
ribald
slander
for

it
be
the
standard
literature
of
an
enormous
class
,
who
must
find
their
reading
in

or
they
will
not

so
long

its

so

be
plainly
visible
in

<EOS>
to
those
who
be
accustomed
to
the
lead
english
journal

or
to
the
respectable
journal
of
the
Continent
of
Europe
;
to
those
who
be
accustomed
to
anything
else
in

it
would
be
impossible
,
without
an
amount
of
extract
for

I
have
neither
space
nor
inclination
,
to
convey
an
adequate
idea

this
frightful
engine
in
America

<EOS>
but
if
any

desire
confirmation
of
my
statement
on
this
head
,
let
him
repair
to
any
place
in
this
city
of
London
,
where
scatter
number
of
these
publication
be

be
find
;
and
there
,
let
him
form
his
own
opinion
.
<EOS>
(

<EOS>
It
would
be
well
<EOS>
,
there
can
be
no
doubt
,
for
the
american
people
as
a
whole
,
if
they
love
the
real
less
,
and
the
Ideal
somewhat
more
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
well
,
if
there
be
great
encouragement
to
lightness
of
heart
and
gaiety
,
and
a
wide
cultivation
of
what
be
beautiful
,
without
be
eminently
and
directly
useful
.
 
<EOS>
but
here
,
I
think
the
general
remonstrance
,
"
we
be
a
new
country
,
"
which
be
so
often
advanced
as
an
excuse
for
defect
which
be
quite
unjustifiable
,
as
be
,
of
right
,
only
the
slow
growth
of
an
old
one
,
may
be
very
reasonably
urge
:
 
and
I
yet
hope
to
hear
of
there
be
some
other
national
amusement
in
the
United
States
,
besides
newspaper
politic
.
   
<EOS>
They
certainly
be
not
a
humorous
people
,
and
their
temperament
always
impress
me
be
be
of
a
dull
and
gloomy
character
.
 
<EOS>
in
shrewdness
of
remark
,
and
a
certain
cast
-
iron
quaintness
,
the
Yankees
,
or
people
of
New
England
,
unquestionably
take
the
lead
;
as
they
do
in
most
other
evidence
of
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
travel
about
,
out
of
the
large
city
---
as
I
have
remark
in
former
part
of
these
volume
---
I
be
quite
oppress
by
the
prevail
seriousness
and
melancholy
air
of
business
:
 
which
be
so
general
and
unvarying
,
that
at
every
new
town
I
come
to
<EOS>
,
I
seem
to
meet
the
very
same
people
whom
I
have
leave
behind
me
,
at
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
such
defect
as
be
perceptible
in
the
national
manner
,
seem
,
to
me
,
to
be
referable
,
in
a
great
degree
,
to
this
cause
:
 
which
have
generate
a
dull
,
sullen
persistence
in
coarse
usage
,
and
reject
the
grace
of
life
as
undeserve
of
attention
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
doubt
that
Washington
,
who
be
always
most
scrupulous
and
exact
on
point
of
ceremony
,
perceive
the
tendency
towards
this
mistake
,
even
in
his
time
,
and
do
his
utmost
to
correct
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
can
not
hold
with
other
writer
on
these
subject
that
the
prevalence
of
various
form
of
dissent
in
America
,
be
in
any
way
attributable
to
the
non
-
existence
there
of
an
established
church
<EOS>
:
indeed
,
I
think
the
temper
of
the
people
,
if
it
admit
of
such
an
Institution
be
found
amongst
them
,
would
lead
them
to
desert
it
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
merely
because
it
be
establish
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
suppose
it
to
exist
,
I
doubt
its
probable
efficacy
in
summon
the
wander
sheep
to
one
great
fold
,
simply
because
of
the
immense
amount
of
dissent
which
prevail
at
home
;
and
because
I
do
not
find
in
America
any
one
form
of
religion
with
which
we
in
Europe
,
or
even
in
England
,
be
unacquainted
.
 
<EOS>
Dissenters
resort
thither
in
great
number
,
as
other
people
do
,
simply
because
it
be
a
land
of
resort
;
and
great
settlement
of
them
be
found
,
because
ground
can
be
purchase
,
and
town
and
village
rear
,
where
there
be
none
of
the
human
creation
before
.
 
<EOS>
but
even
the
shaker
emigrate
from
England
;
our
country
be
not
unknown
to
Mr
Joseph
Smith
,
the
apostle
of
Mormonism
,
or
to
his
benighted
disciple
;
I
have
behold
religious
scene
myself
in
some
of
our
populous
town
which
can
hardly
be
surpass
by
an
american
camp
-
meeting
;
and
I
be
not
aware
that
any
instance
of
superstitious
imposture
on
the
one
hand
,
and
superstitious
credulity
on
the
other
,
have
have
its
origin
in
the
United
States
,
which
we
can
not
more
than
parallel
by
the
precedent
of
Mrs
Southcote
,
Mary
toft
<EOS>
the
rabbit
-
breeder
,
or
even
Mr
Thorn
of
Canterbury
:
 
<EOS>
which
latter
case
arise
,
some
time
after
the
dark
age
have
pass
away
.
   
<EOS>
the
Republican
Institutions
of
America
undoubtedly
lead
the
people
to
assert
their
self
-
respect
and
their
equality
;
but
a
traveller
be
bind
to
bear
those
institution
in
his
mind
,
and
not
hastily
to
resent
the
near
approach
of
a
class
of
stranger
,
who
,
at
home
,
would
keep
aloof
.
 
<EOS>
this
characteristic
,
when
it
be
tincture
with
no
foolish
pride
,
and
stop
short
of
no
honest
service
,
never
offend
me
;
and
I
very
seldom
,
if
ever
,
experience
its
rude
or
unbecoming
display
.
 
<EOS>
once
or
twice
it
be
comically
develop
,
as
in
the
follow
case
;
but
this
be
an
amusing
incident
,
and
not
the
rule
,
or
near
it
.
   
<EOS>
I
want
a
pair
of
boot
at
a
certain
town
,
for
I
have
none
to
travel
in
,
but
those
with
the
memorable
cork
sol
,
which
be
much
too
hot
for
the
fiery
deck
of
a
steamboat
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
send
a
message
to
an
artist
in
boot
,
import
,
with
my
compliment
,
that
I
should
be
happy
to
see
him
,
if
he
would
do
me
the
polite
favour
to
call
.
 
<EOS>
He
very
kindly
return
for
answer
,
that
he
would
"
look
round
"
at
six
o'clock
that
evening
.
   
<EOS>
I
be
lie
on
the
sofa
,
with
a
book
and
a
wine
-
glass
,
at
about
that
time
,
when
the
door
open
,
and
a
gentleman
in
a
stiff
cravat
,
within
a
year
or
two
on
either
side
of
thirty
,
enter
,
in
his
hat
and
glove
;
walk
up
to
the
looking
-
glass
;
arrange
his
hair
;
take
off
his
glove
;
slowly
produce
a
measure
from
the
uttermost
depth
of
his
coat
-
pocket
;
and
request
me
,
in
a
languid
tone
,
to
"
unfix
"
my
strap
.
 
<EOS>
I
comply
,
but
look
with
some
curiosity
at
his
hat
,
which
be
still
upon
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
have
be
that
,
or
it
may
have
be
the
heat
---
but
he
take
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
he
sit
himself
down
on
a
chair
opposite
to
me
;
rest
an
arm
on
each
knee
;
and
,
lean
forward
very
much
,
take
from
the
ground
,
by
a
great
effort
,
the
speciman
of
metropolitan
workmanship
which
I
have
just
pull
off
:
 
whistling
,
pleasantly
,
as
he
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
He
turn
it
over
and
over
;
survey
it
with
a
contempt
no
language
can
express
;
and
inquire
if
I
wish
him
to
fix
me
a
boot
like
that
?
 
<EOS>
I
courteously
reply
,
that
provide
the
boot
be
large
enough
,
I
would
leave
the
rest
to
him
;
that
if
convenient
and
practicable
,
I
should
not
object
to
their
bearing
some
resemblance
to
the
model
then
before
him
;
but
that
I
would
be
entirely
guide
by
,
and
would
beg
to
leave
the
whole
subject
to
,
his
judgment
and
discretion
.
<EOS>
"
You
an't
partickler
,
about
this
scoop
in
the
heel
,
I
suppose
then
?
"
say
he
:
 
<EOS>
"
we
do
not
foller
that
,
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
repeat
my
last
observation
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
at
himself
in
the
glass
again
;
go
closer
to
it
to
dash
a
grain
or
two
of
dust
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
;
and
settle
his
cravat
.
 
<EOS>
all
this
time
,
my
leg
and
foot
be
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
nearly
ready
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
pretty
nigh
,
"
he
say
;
"
keep
steady
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
keep
as
steady
as
I
could
,
both
in
foot
and
face
;
and
have
by
this
time
get
the
dust
out
,
and
find
his
pencil
-
case
,
he
measure
me
,
and
make
the
necessary
note
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
finish
,
he
fall
into
his
old
attitude
,
and
take
up
the
boot
again
,
muse
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
and
this
,
"
he
say
,
at
last
,
"
be
an
english
boot
,
be
it
?
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
London
boot
,
eh
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
that
,
sir
,
"
I
reply
,
"
be
a
London
boot
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
muse
over
it
again
,
after
the
manner
of
Hamlet
with
Yorick
's
skull
;
nod
his
head
,
as
who
should
say
,
"
I
pity
the
Institutions
that
lead
to
the
production
of
this
boot
!
"
;
rise
;
put
up
his
pencil
,
note
,
and
paper
---
glance
at
himself
in
the
glass
,
all
the
time
---
put
on
his
hat
---
draw
on
his
glove
very
slowly
;
and
finally
walk
out
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
have
be
go
about
a
minute
,
the
door
reopen
,
and
his
hat
and
his
head
reappear
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
round
the
room
,
and
at
the
boot
again
,
which
be
still
lie
on
the
floor
;
appear
thoughtful
for
a
minute
;
and
then
say
"
well
,
good
arternoon
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
good
afternoon
,
sir
,
"
say
I
:
<EOS>
and
that
be
the
end
of
the
interview
.
   
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
other
head
on
which
I
wish
to
offer
a
remark
;
and
that
have
reference
to
the
public
health
.
 
<EOS>
in
so
vast
a
country
,
where
there
be
thousand
of
million
of
acre
of
land
yet
unsettle
and
uncleared
,
and
on
every
rood
of
which
,
vegetable
decomposition
be
annually
take
place
;
where
there
be
so
many
great
river
,
and
such
opposite
variety
of
climate
<EOS>
;
there
can
not
fail
to
be
a
great
amount
of
sickness
at
certain
season
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
may
venture
to
say
,
after
converse
with
many
member
of
the
medical
profession
in
America
,
that
I
be
not
singular
in
the
opinion
that
much
of
the
disease
which
do
prevail
,
may
be
avoid
,
if
a
few
common
precaution
be
observe
.
 
<EOS>
Greater
mean
of
personal
cleanliness
,
be
indispensable
to
this
end
;
the
custom
of
hastily
swallow
large
quantity
of
animal
food
,
three
time
a
-
day
,
and
rush
back
to
sedentary
pursuit
after
each
meal
,
must
be
change
;
the
gentler
sex
must
go
more
wisely
clothe
,
and
take
more
healthful
exercise
;
and
in
the
latter
clause
,
the
male
must
be
include
also
.
 
<EOS>
above
all
,
in
public
institution
,
and
throughout
the
whole
of
every
town
and
city
,
the
system
of
ventilation
,
and
drainage
,
and
removal
of
impurity
require
to
be
thoroughly
revise
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
local
Legislature
in
America
which
may
not
study
Mr
Chadwick
's
excellent
report
upon
the
Sanitary
Condition
of
our
Labouring
Classes
,
with
immense
advantage
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
now
arrive
at
the
close
of
this
book
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
little
reason
to
believe
,
from
certain
warning
I
have
have
since
I
return
to
England
,
that
it
will
be
tenderly
or
favourably
receive
by
the
american
people
;
and
as
I
have
write
the
truth
in
relation
to
the
mass
of
those
who
form
their
judgment
and
express
their
opinion
,
it
will
be
see
that
I
have
no
desire
to
court
,
by
any
adventitious
mean
,
the
popular
applause
.
   
<EOS>
It
be
enough
for
me
,
to
know
,
that
what
I
have
set
down
in
these
page
,
can
not
cost
me
a
single
friend
on
the
other
side
of
the
Atlantic
,
who
be
,
in
anything
,
deserve
of
the
name
.
 
<EOS>
for
the
rest
,
I
put
my
trust
,
implicitly
,
in
the
spirit
in
which
they
have
be
conceive
and
pen
;
and
I
can
bide
my
time
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
make
no
reference
to
my
reception
,
nor
have
I
suffer
it
to
influence
me
in
what
I
have
write
;
for
,
in
either
case
,
I
should
have
offer
but
a
sorry
acknowledgment
,
compare
with
that
I
bear
within
my
breast
,
towards
those
partial
reader
of
my
former
book
,
across
the
Water
,
who
meet
me
with
an
open
hand
,
and
not
with
one
that
close
upon
an
iron
muzzle
.
