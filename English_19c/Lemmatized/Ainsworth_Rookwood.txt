the
mode
of

of
the
rough

rudest
make

of

homely
appearance

melancholy

His

delicately

may
be
characterize
as
singularly
handsome

be
it
not
for
a
want
of
roundness
in
the
contour
of
the
face
which
give
the
lineament
a
thin

worn
look

totally
distinct

from
haggardness

emaciation

delicate

fine

the
nostril

so
;
the
upper
lip

short

haughtily
expressive

complexion

His

We

an
odd
caricature
of
humanity
.
<EOS>
His
figure
be
lean
,
and
almost
as
lank
as
a
skeleton

<EOS>
His
bald
head

one
of
a

the
overhanging
and
hoary
brow

gray
orb

<EOS>

endure
his
gaze

and
,
aware
of
his
power

Peter
seldom
fail
to
exercise
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
likewise
another
habit
,
which
,
as
it
savor
of
insanity
,
make
him
an
object
of
commiseration
with
some
,
while
it
render
him
yet
more
obnoxious
to
other

<EOS>
the
habit
we
allude
to
,
be
the
indulgence
of
wild
screaming
laughter
at
time
when
all
merriment
should
be
check
;
and
when
the
exhibition
of
levity
must
proceed
from
utter
disregard
of
human
grief
and
suffering
,
or
from
mental
alienation
.
<EOS>
weary
with
the
prolonged
silence
,
Peter

length
condescend
to
speak

<EOS>
"It

continue
the

press
the

him

<EOS>
first
impulse
have
be
to
free
himself
from

restraint

by
his
grandsire

society

<EOS>
He

to
commune
with
himself
.
<EOS>
leap
the
small
boundary

wall
,
which
defend
the
churchyard
from
a
deep
green
lane
,
he
hurry
along
in
a
direction
contrary
to
that
take
by
the
sexton
,
make
the
good
of
his
way
until
he
arrive
at
a
gap
in
the
high
-
banked
hazel
hedge
which
overhang
the
road
.
<EOS>
heedless
of
the
impediment
throw
in
his
way
by
the
undergrowth
of
a
rough
ring
fence

he
strike
through
the
opening
that
present

and
,
climb
over
the
moss
-
grow

trod
presently
upon

elastic
sward
of

<EOS>
a
few
minute
'
rapid
walking
bring
him
to
the
summit
of
a
rise
ground
crown
with
aged
oak
and
,
as
he
pass
beneath
their
broad
shadow

his
troubled
spirit

soothe

the
quietude

the
scene

serenity

Luke
yield
to
the
gentle
influence
of
the
time
and
hour

<EOS>
the
stillness
of
the
spot
allay
the
irritation
of
his
frame
,
and
the
dewy
chillness
cool
the
fever
of
his
brow
.
<EOS>
lean
for
support
against
the
gnarled
trunk
of
one
of
the
tree
,
he
give
himself
up
to
contemplation
.
<EOS>
the
event
of
the
last
hour
—
of
his
whole
existence
—
pass
in
rapid
review
before
him
.
<EOS>
the
thought
of
the
wayward
,
vagabond
life
he
have
lead
;
of
the
wild
adventure
of
his
youth
;
of
all
he
have
be
;
of
all
he
have
do
,
of
all
he
have
endure
—
crowd
his
mind
;
and
then
,
like
the
passing
of
a
cloud
flit
across
the
autumnal
moon
,
and
occasionally
obscure
the
smile
landscape
before
him
,
his
soul
be
shadow
by
the
remembrance
of
the
awful
revelation
of
the
last
hour
,
and
the
fearful
knowledge
he
have
acquire
of
his
mother
's
fate
—
of
his
father
's
guilt
.
<EOS>
the
eminence
on
which
he
stand
be
one
of
the
high
point
of
the
park
,
and
command
a
view
of
the
hall
,
which
may
be
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
,
discernible
through
a
broken
vista
of
tree
,
its
whitened
wall
glimmer
in
the
moonlight
,
and
its
tall
chimney
spire
far
from
out
the
round
masse
of
wood

direction

into
swell

stud
with
magnificent
timber

dip
into
smooth
dell
,
or
stretch
out
into
level
glade
,
until
it
suddenly
sink
into
a
deep
declivity
,
that
form
an
effectual
division
,
without
the
intervention
of
a
haw

haw
,
or
other
barrier

chase

the
mead

even
at

distance

and
in
that
still
hour

you
may
almost
catch
the
sound
of
the
brawling
water
,
as
they
dash
down
the
weir
in
a
foam
cascade
;
while
,
far
away
,
in
the
spread
valley
,
the
serpentine
meandering
of
the
slender
current
may
be
trace
,
glitter
like
silvery
thread
in
the
moonshine

the
mild
beam
of
the
queen
of
night

then
in

meridian
,
tremble
upon
the
topmost
branch

tall
timber

quiver
like
diamond
spray
upon

outer
foliage

penetrate
through
the
interstice
of

tree

fall
upon
the
light
wreath
of
vapor
then
begin
to
arise
from
the
surface
of
the
pool

steep
them
in
misty
splendor
,
and
lend
to
this
part
of
the
picture
a
character
of
dreamy
and
unearthly
beauty

<EOS>
all

be
in
unison

<EOS>

the
silence
of

solitude

hooting
of

large
gray
owl

at
his
approach
,
or
in
search
of
prey
,
wing
its
spectral
flight
in
continuous
and
mazy
circle
round
his
head
,
utter
at
each
wheel
its
startling
whoop
;
or
a
deep
,
distant
bay
,
that
ever
and
anon
boom
upon
the
ear
,
proceed
from
a
pack
of
hound
kennel
in
a
shed
adjoin
the
pool
before
mention

but
which

from

<EOS>
no

a
herd
of

in
a
covert
of
brown
fern
beneath
the
shadow
of
a
few
stunted
tree
,
immediately
below
the
point
of
land
on
which
Luke
stand
;

although
their
branching
antler
could
scarcely
be

from

ramification
of

they
escape
not
his
practise

"How

Luke
mechanically

his

yet
his

scarcely

the
piece
half
way
to
his

,
when
he
drop
it
again
to
its
rest

<EOS>
"what
<EOS>

I
about
to
do

"
<EOS>

.
<EOS>
"
why
,
for
mere
pastime

should
I
take
away
yon
noble
creature
's
life
,
when
his
carcass
would
be
utterly
useless
to
me
?
<EOS>
yet
such
be
the
force
of
habit
,
that
I
can
scarce
resist
the
impulse
that
tempt
me
to
fire
;
and
I
have
know
the

<EOS>
"unconscious

of

,
with
a

high
in

,
the
buck
fall
upon
his

,
struggle
in
the
agony
of
death

<EOS>
Luke
have
at
once
divine
the
cause
;
he
be
aware
that
poacher
be
at
hand

<EOS>
He
fancy
that
he
know
the
party

nor
be
he

in
his
conjecture

<EOS>
two

instantly
from

on

<EOS>
the
former
raise
himself
from

both
appear
to

attentively

<EOS>
Luke
fancy
he

sound

distance

whatever
the
noise
proceed
from
,
it

evident
the
deer

<EOS>
They
lay
hold
of
the
buck
,
and
,
drag
it
along
,
conceal
the
carcass
among
the
tall

they

the

just
at

too

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
but
if
I
be
find
here
,
I
shall
be
take
for

<EOS>
something
must
be
do
—
ha!—devil
take
them
,
here
they
be
already

<EOS>
"further
<EOS>
time
be
not

him
for
reflection

<EOS>
a
hoarse
baying
be
hear
,
follow
by
a
loud
cry
from
the
keeper
.
<EOS>
the
dog
have
scent
out
the
game
;
and
,
as
secrecy
be
no
longer
necessary
,
his
muzzle
have
be
remove
.
<EOS>
to
rush
forth
now
be
certain
betrayal
;
to
remain
be
almost
equally
assure
detection
;
and
,
doubt
whether
he
should
obtain
credence
if
he
deliver
himself
over
in
that
garb
and
armed
,
Luke
at
once
reject
the
idea
.
<EOS>
just
then
it
flash
across
his
recollection
that
his
gun
have
remain
unloaded
,
and
he
apply
himself
eagerly
to
repair
this
negligence
,
when
he
hear
the
dog
in
full
cry
,
make
swiftly
in
his
direction
.
<EOS>
He
throw
himself
upon
the
ground
,
where
the
fern
be
thickest
;
but
this
seem
insufficient
to
baffle
the
sagacity
of
the
hound
—
the
animal
have
get
his
scent
,
and
be
bay
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
the
keeper
be
draw
nigh
.
<EOS>
Luke
give
himself
up
for
lose
.
<EOS>
the
dog
,
however
,
stop
where
the
two
poacher
have
halt
,
and
be
there
completely
at
fault
:
snuff
the
ground
,
he
bay
,
wheeled
round
,
and
then
set
off
with
renew
barking
upon
their
track
.
<EOS>
Hugh
Badger
and
his
comrade
loiter
an
instant
at
the
same
place
,
look
warily
round
,
and
then
,
as
Luke
conjecture
,
follow
the
course
take
by
the
hound
.
<EOS>
swift
as
thought
,
Luke
arise
,
and
keep
as
much
as
possible
under
cover
of
the
tree
,
start
in
a
cross
line
for
the
lane
.
<EOS>
rapid
as
be
his
flight
,
it
be
not
without
a
witness
:
<EOS>
one
of
the
keeper
's
assistant
,
who
have
lag
behind
,
give
the
view
-
halloo
in
a
loud
voice
.
<EOS>
Luke
press
forward
with
redouble
energy
,
endeavor
to
gain
the
shelter
of
the
plantation
,
and
this
he
could
readily
have
accomplish
,
have
no
impediment
be
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
but
his
rage
and
vexation
be
boundless
,
when
he
hear
the
keeper
's
cry
echo
by
shout
immediately
below
him
,
and
the
tongue
of
the
hound
resounding
in
the
hollow
.
<EOS>
He
turn
sharply
round
,
steer
a
middle
course
,
and
still
aim
at
the
fence
.
<EOS>
It
be
evident
,
from
the
cheer
of
his
pursuer
,
that
he
be
in
full
view
,
and
he
hear
them
encourage
and
direct
the
dog
.
<EOS>
Luke
have
gain
the
park
paling
,
along
which
he
rush
,
in
the
vain
quest
of
some
practicable
point
of
egress
,
for
the
fence
be
high
in
this
part
of
the
park
than
elsewhere
,
owe
to
the
inequality
of
the
ground
.
<EOS>
He
have
cast
away
his
gun
as
useless
.
<EOS>
but
even
without
that
incumbrance
,
he
dare
not
hazard
the
delay
of
climb
the
paling
.
<EOS>
at
this
juncture
a
deep
breathing
be
hear
close
behind
him
.
<EOS>
He
throw
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
within
a
few
yard
be
a
ferocious
bloodhound
,
with
whose
savage
nature
Luke
be
well
acquaint
;
the
breed
,
some
of
which
he
have
already
see
,
have
be
maintain
at
the
hall
ever
since
the
day
of
grim
old
Sir
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
the
eye
of
the
hound
be
glare
,
blood
-
red
;
his
tongue
be
hang
out
,
and
a
row
of
keen
white
fang
be
display
,
like
the
tooth
of
a
shark
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
growl
—
a
leap
—
and
the
dog
be
close
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Luke
's
courage
be
undoubted
.
<EOS>
but
his
heart
fail
him
as
he
hear
the
roar
of
the
remorseless
brute
,
and
feel
that
he
could
not
avoid
an
encounter
with
the
animal
.
<EOS>
His
resolution
be
instantly
take
:
he
stop
short
with
such
suddenness
,
that
the
dog
,
when
in
the
act
of
springing
,
fly
past
him
with
great
violence
,
and
the
time
,
momentary
as
it
be
,
occupy
by
the
animal
in
recover
himself
,
enable
Luke
to
drop
on
his
knee
,
and
to
place
one
arm
,
like
a
buckler
,
before
his
face
,
while
he
hold
the
other
in
readiness
to
grapple
his
adversary
.
<EOS>
utter
a
fierce
yell
,
the
hound
return
to
the
charge
,
dart
at
Luke
,
who
receive
the
assault
without
flinch
;
and
in
spite
of
a
severe
laceration
of
the
arm
,
he
seize
his
foe
by
the
throat
,
and
hurl
him
upon
the
ground
,
jump
with
all
his
force
upon
his
belly
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
yell
of
agony
—
the
contest
be
end
,
and
Luke
be
at
liberty
to
pursue
his
flight
unmoleste
.
<EOS>
brief
as
have
be
the
interval
require
for
this
combat
,
it
have
be
sufficient
to
bring
the
pursuer
within
sight
of
the
fugitive
.
<EOS>
Hugh
Badger
,
who
from
the
acclivity
have
witness
the
fate
of
his
favorite
,
with
a
loud
oath
discharge
the
content
of
his
gun
at
the
head
of
its
destroyer
.
<EOS>
It
be
fortunate
for
Luke
that
at
this
instant
he
stumble
over
the
root
of
a
tree
—
the
shot
rattle
in
the
leave
as
he
fall
,
and
the
keeper
,
conclude
that
he
have
at
least
wing
his
bird
,
descend
more
leisurely
towards
him
.
<EOS>
as
he
lie
upon
the
ground
,
Luke
feel
that
he
be
wound
;
whether
by
the
tooth
of
the
dog
,
from
a
stray
shot
,
or
from
bruise
inflict
by
the
fall
,
he
could
not
determine
.
<EOS>
but
,
smart
with
pain
,
he
resolve
to
wreak
his
vengeance
upon
the
first
person
who
approach
him
.
<EOS>
He
vow
not
to
be
take
with
life
—
to
strangle
any
who
should
lay
hand
upon
him
.
<EOS>
at
that
moment
he
feel
a
pressure
at
his
breast
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
dead
hand
of
his
mother!luke
shudder
.
<EOS>
the
fire
of
revenge
be
quench
.
<EOS>
He
mentally
cancel
his
rash
oath
;
yet
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
surrender
at
discretion
,
and
without
further
effort
.
<EOS>
the
keeper
and
his
assistant
be
approach
the
spot
where
he
lie
,
and
search
for
his
body
.
<EOS>
Hugh
Badger
be
foremost
,
and
within
a
yard
of
him
.
<EOS>
"confound
<EOS>
the
rascal

<EOS>

Hugh
,
"
he
be
not
half
kill
<EOS>
;
he
seem
to
breathe

<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
word
be
scarcely
out
of
his
mouth
ere
the
speaker
be
dash
backwards
,
and
lie
sprawl
upon

sod

<EOS>
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
,
as
an
indian
chief
may
rush
upon
his
foe
,
Luke
arise
,
dash
himself
with
great
violence
against
Hugh

who
happen
to
stand
in
his
way

and
before
the
startled

who
be
either

fairly
over

Badger
be
shortly
on
his
leg

lustily
at
his
defeat

<EOS>
direct
his
man
to
skirt
alongside
the
fence

and
make
for
a
particular
part
of
the
plantation

a
load
fowling

piece
from

over

by

other
sound
convey

speedily
upon

track

<EOS>
the
plantation
through
which
the
chase
now
take
place
be
not
,
as
may
be
suppose

a
continuation
of

Luke

originally
cross
on

entrance
into

into

defile

in

His

upon

it
have
the
effect

by
irritate
his

the
thirst

Hugh

have
no

margin

He

cautiously

the

<EOS>
the

the

the

pursue
the
wandering
of

occasionally

into

here

at

from

that
the
object
of
his
pursuit
have
scale
the

and
he
forthwith
moderate
his
pace

<EOS>
halt

he
perceive
what
he
take

at

behind
a
knot
of
alder

His

"No

expostulation

Hugh

his

the

not

<EOS>
a

down
the

the

have

practise
upon
the
keeper

<EOS>
little
time

allow
him
for
reflection

<EOS>
before
he
could
reload
,
he
feel
himself
collar
by
the
iron
arm
of
Luke

<EOS>
Hugh
Badger
be
a
man
of
great
personal
strength
—
square
-
set
,
bandy
-
legged
,
with
a
prodigious
width
of
chest
,
and
a
frame
like
a
Hercules

and
,
energetic
as

Luke

assault

he
maintain
his

without

the

be
desperate

Luke

by
the
head

<EOS>
this
superiority
avail
him
little

<EOS>
It
be
rather
a
disadvantage

conflict

ensue

<EOS>
the
gripe
fasten
upon
Hugh

throat
be
like

Luke

defend
himself
with

vehemently

Hugh
succeed

extricate
himself
from
his
throttling
grasp
;
he
then
close
with
his
foe
,
and
they
be
lock
together

all
with

victory
,
at

,
seem
to
declare
itself
in

of
the
sturdy

<EOS>
aware
of
his
opponent
's
strength
,
it
be
Luke
's
chief
endeavor
to
keep
his
low
limb
disengaged
,
and
to
trust
more
to
skill
than
force
for
ultimate
success

<EOS>
to
prevent
this
be
Hugh

grand
object

with

this

It

Henrys

the
graceful

peaceable

the

the
Rookwoods

the
gentle
characteristic
of
a

though
it

boast
little
of
that
exuberance

external

luxuriance

prodigality

which

under
the

<EOS>
the

occupy

almost
rebuild
the

mansion
,
in
the
end
so
metamorphose
its
aspect
,
that
at
last
little
of
its
original
and
distinctive
character
remain

<EOS>
still
,
as
we
say
before

it
be
a
fine

though
some
change
have
take
place
for
the
bad
,
which
could
not
be
readily
pardon
by
the
eye

taste
:
<EOS>
as
,
for
instance
,
the
deep
embaye
window
have
dwindle
into
modernized
casement

of

construction

the
wide
porch

flight

the
house

for
an

after
all

what
be
like
an
old

no
undesirable

<EOS>
Marie

<EOS>
from

its
inhabitant
the
transition
be
natural
.
<EOS>
besides
the
connexion
between
them
,
there
be
many
point
of
resemblance
;
many
family
feature
in
common
;
there
be
the
same
melancholy
grandeur
,
the
same
character
of
romance
,
the
same
fantastical
display
.
<EOS>
nor
be
the
secret
passage
,
peculiar
to

want

the

<EOS>
both
have

<EOS>
one

pale

their
sun
be
eclipse
in
blood
from
its
rise

its
meridian

and
so
it
seem
would
be
its
setting

<EOS>
this
foul
reproach
attach
to
all
the
race
;
none
escape
it

<EOS>
traditional
rumor
be
hand
down

throughout
the
county

and
,
like
all
other
rumor

have
take
to
themselves
wing

fly
abroad

their
crime

word

<EOS>
how
be
it
they

punishment
?
<EOS>
how
come
they
to

<EOS>
Proof

They

indomitable
pride

force

difficulty

overwhelm
ordinary
individual

<EOS>
no
quality

its
possessor

firmness

the
determined
energy
of
the
Rookwoods

them
harmless
through
a
sea
of
trouble

<EOS>
besides

they
be
wealthy

lavish

gold

ominous

various

<EOS>
amongst

it

state
that
the

suspicion
be
his

that
it
be
the
discovery

infidelity
in

his
sudden

with
his

<EOS>
other

that
he

<EOS>
this
be
all
that
could
be
gather

the
misfortune

<EOS>
the
young
Sir

attend
Charles

in
the
character

if
he
could
not
requite
the
devotion
of
the
son

by
absolutely
reinstate
the
fall
fortune

the
monarch
could
at

accord
him
the

bestow
upon
him
certain

travel
.
<EOS>
shortly
after
the
completion
of
his
academical
education
,
he
have
depart
to
make
the
tour
of
the
continent
,
and
have
be
absent
rather
well
than
a
year
.
<EOS>
He
have
quit
his
father
in
displeasure
,
and
be
destine
never
again
to
see
his
face
while
live
.
<EOS>
the
last
intelligence
receive
of
young
Rookwood
be
from
Bordeaux
,
whence
<EOS>
it
be
think
he
have
depart
for
the
Pyrenees
.
<EOS>
a
special
messenger
have
be
despatch
in
search
of
him
,
with
tiding
of
the
melancholy
event
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
it
be
deem
improbable
by
Lady
Rookwood
that
her
son
could
return
within
any
reasonable
space
,
she
give
direction
for
the
accomplishment
of
the
funeral
rite
of
her
husband
on
the
sixth
night
after
his
decease
—
it
be
the
custom
of
the
Rookwoods
ever
to
inter
their
dead
at
midnight,—intruste
their
solemnization
entirely
to
the
care
of
one
of
Sir
Piers
's
hanger
-
on
—
Dr
.
<EOS>
Titus
Tyrconnel,—for
which
she
be
greatly
scandalize
in
the
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
Ranulph
Rookwood
be
a
youth
of
goodly
promise
.
<EOS>
the
stock
from
which
he
spring
<EOS>
would
on
neither
side
warrant
such
conclusion
.
<EOS>
but
it
sometimes
happen
that
from
the
dark
element
be
compound
the
bright
and
subtlest
substance
;
and
so
it
occur
in
this
instance
.
<EOS>
Fair
,
frank
,
and
free
—
generous
,
open
,
unsuspicious
<EOS>
—
he
seem
the
very
opposite
of
all
his
race
—
their
antagonize
principle
.
<EOS>
capriciously
indulgent
,
his
father
have
allow
him
ample
mean
,
neither
curb
nor
restrain
his
expenditure
;
accede
at
one
moment
to
every
inclination
,
and
the
next
irresolutely
oppose
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
,
therefore
,
for
him
,
in
such
a
state
of
thing
,
to
act
decidedly
,
without
incur
his
father
's
displeasure
;
and
the
only
measure
he
resolve
upon
,
which
be
to
absent
himself
for
a
time
,
be
conjecture
to
have
bring
about
the
result
he
have
endeavor
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
other
reason
,
however
,
there
be
,
which
secretly
influence
him
,
which
it
will
be
our
business
in

<EOS>
there

ripe

ready

It

graceful
refinement

nor

<EOS>
no

melancholy

unaffected
emotion

the
company

as
remind
them
forcibly
of
the
depart

of
which
it
seem
a
portion

<EOS>
the
party
consist
of
the
vicar
of
Rookwood
,
Dr.
Polycarp
Small
;
Dr.
Titus
Tyrconnel
,
an
emigrant
,
and
empirical
professor
of

,
from

,
whose
convivial
habit
have
first
introduce
him

and
afterwards
retain
him
there

Mr.
Codicil
Coates
,
clerk

attorney

,
bailiff
,
and
receiver

<EOS>
We
be
wrong

Tyrconnel
be
retain
.
<EOS>
He
be
an
impudent
,
intrusive
fellow
,
whom
,
have
once
gain
a
footing
in
the
house
,
it
be
impossible
to
dislodge
.
<EOS>
He
care
for
no
insult
;
perceive
no
slight
;
and
profess
,
in
her
presence
,
the
profound
respect
for
Lady
Rookwood
:
in
short
,
he
be
ever
ready
to
do
anything
but
depart
.
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
be
one
of
those
people
who
can
not
dine
alone
.
<EOS>
He
dislike
a
solitary
repast
almost
as
much
as
a
tête
-
à
-
tête
with
his
lady
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
be
recognize
at
once
as
the
true
Amphitryon
,
have
any
one
be
hardy
enough
to
play
the
part
of
Jupiter
.
<EOS>
ever
ready
to
give
a
dinner
,
he
find
a
difficulty
arise
,
not
usually
experience
on
such
occasion
—
there
be
no
one
upon
whom
to
bestow
it
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
good
of
wine
;
keep
an
excellent
table
;
be
himself
no
niggard
host
;
but
his
own
merit
,
and
those
of
his
cuisine
,
be
forget
in
the
invariable
pendant
to
the
feast
;
and
the
good
of
wine
lose
its
flavor
when
the
last
bottle
find
its
way
to
the
guest
's
head
.
<EOS>
Dine
alone
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
would
not
.
<EOS>
and
as
his
old
friend
forsook
him
,
he
plunge
lower
in
his
search
of
society
;
collect
within
his
house
a
class
of
person
whom
no
one
would
have
expect
to
meet
at
the
hall
,
nor
even
its
owner
have
choose
for
his
companion
,
have
any
choice
remain
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
endure
this
state
of
thing
without
much
outward
show
of
discontent
.
<EOS>
"
anything
for
a
quiet
life
,
"
be
his
constant
saying
;
and
,
like
the
generality
of
people
with
whom
those
word
form
a
favorite
maxim
,
he
lead
the
most
uneasy
life
imaginable
.
<EOS>
endurance
,
to
excite
commiseration
,
must
be
uncomplaining
—
an
axiom
the
aggrieved
of
the
gentle
sex
should
remember
.
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
endure
,
but
he
grumble
lustily
,
and
be
on
all
hand
vote
a
bore
;
domestic
grievance
,
especially
if
the
husband
be
the
plaintiff
,
be
the
most
intolerable
of
all
mentionable
misery
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
that
his
friend
desert
him
;
still
there
be
Titus
Tyrconnel
;
his
ear
and
lip
be
ever
open
to
pathos
and
to
punch
;
so
Titus
keep
his
station
.
<EOS>
immediately
after
her
husband
's
demise
,
it
have
be
Lady
Rookwood
's
intention
to

no

his
width

his
sesquipedality
of

and
obesity
of

these

with
him
synonymous

rebellious

schismatical
.
<EOS>
on
this
head
he
be
incline
to
be
disputatious
.
<EOS>
His
prejudice
do
not
prevent
him
from
pass
the
claret
,
nor
from
laugh
,
as
heartily
as
a
plethoric
asthma
and
sense
of
the
decorum

would
permit

at

Irishman

who

he
admit
,
notwithstanding
his

,

a
pleasant
fellow

<EOS>
and
when
,
in

to
the
flattery
,
a

be
insinuate
by
the

Titus
,
at
the
precise
moment
that
Small
yearn
for
his
afternoon

solace
,
yet
scruple
to
ask
for
it
;
when
the
door

all

"Well
,
at
this
moment
—
this
terrible
moment
—
what
should
I
hear
but
a
tap
against
the
wainscot
.
<EOS>
Holy
Virgin
!
<EOS>
how
it
startle
me
.
<EOS>
My
heart
leapt
to
my
mouth
in
an
instant
,
and
then
go
thump
,
thump
,
against
my
rib
.
<EOS>
but
I
say
nothing
,
though
you
may
be
sure
I
keep
my
ear
wide
open
—
and
then
presently
I
hear
the
tap
repeat
somewhat
louder
,
and
shortly
afterwards
a
third
—
I
should
still
have
say
nothing
,
but
Sir
Piers
hear
the
knock
,
and
raise
himself
at
the
summon
,
as
if
it
have
be
the
last
trumpet
.
'
<EOS>
come
in
,
'
cry
he
,
in
a
die
voice
;
and
Heaven
forgive
me
if
I
confess
that
I
expect
a
certain
person
,
whose
company
one
would
rather
dispense
with
upon
such
an
occasion
,
to
step
in
.
<EOS>
however
,
though
it
be
not
the
ould
gentleman
,
it
be
somebody
near
akin
to
him
;
for
a
door
I
have
never
see
,
and
never
even
dream
of
,
open
in
the
wall
,
and
in
step
Peter
Bradley
—
ay
,
you
may
well
stare
,
gentleman
;
but
it
be
Peter
,
look
as
stiff
as
a
crowbar
,
and
as
blue
as
a
mattock
.
<EOS>
well
,
he
walk
straight
up
to
the
bed
of
the
die
man
,
and
bend
his
great
,
diabolical
gray
eye
upon
him
,
laugh
all
the
while
—
<EOS>
yes
,
laugh
—
you
know
the
curse
grin
he
have
.
<EOS>
to
proceed
.
'
<EOS>
You
have
call
me
,
'
say
he
to
Sir
Piers
;
'
I
be
here
.
<EOS>
what
would
you
with
me?'—'We
be
not
alone
,
'
groan
the
die
man
.
'
<EOS>
leave
us
,
Mr.
Tyrconnel
—
leave
me
for
five
minute
—
only
five
,
mark
me
.
<EOS>
'—'i'll
go
,
'
think
I
,
'
but
I
shall
never
see
you
again
alive
.
'
<EOS>
and
true
enough
it
be
—
I
never
do
see
him
again
with
breath
in
his
body
.
<EOS>
without
more
ado
,
I
leave
him
,
and
I
have
scarcely
reach
the
corridor
when
I
hear
the
door
bolt
behind
me
.
<EOS>
I
then
stop
to
listen
:
and
I
be
sure
you
will
not
blame
me
when
I
say
I
clap
my
eye
to
the
keyhole
;
for
I
suspect
something
wrong
.
<EOS>
but
,
Heaven
save
us
!
<EOS>
that
crafty
gravedigger
have
take
his
precaution
too
well
.
<EOS>
I
could
neither
see
nor
hear
anything
,
except
after
a
few
minute
,
<EOS>
a
wild
unearthly
screech
.
<EOS>
and
then
the
door
be
throw
open
,
and
I
,
not
expect
it
,
be
precipitate
head
foremost
into
the
room
,
to
the
great
damage
of
my
nose
.
<EOS>
when
I
get
up
,
Peter
have
vanish
,
I
suppose
,
as
he
come
;
and
there
be
poor
Sir
Piers
lean
back
upon
the
pillow
with
his
hand
stretch
out
as
if
in
supplication
,
his
eye
unclosed
and
stare
,
and
his
limb
stark
and
<EOS>
stiff!"A
profound
silence
succeed
this
narrative
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Coates
would
not
venture
upon
a
remark
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Small
seem
,
for
some
minute
,
lose
in
painful
reflection
;
at
length
he
speak
:
"
You
have
describe
a
shocking
scene
,
Mr.
Tyrconnel
,
and
in
a
manner
that
convince
me
of
its
fidelity
.
<EOS>
but
I
trust
you
will
excuse
me
,
as
a
friend
of
the
late
Sir
Piers
,
in
request
you
to
maintain
silence
in
future
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Its
repetition
can
be
productive
of
no
good
,
and
may
do
infinite
harm
by
give
currency
to
unpleasant
report
,
and
harrow
the
feeling
of
the
survivor
.
<EOS>
every
one
acquaint
with
Sir
Piers
's
history
must
be
aware
,
as
I
dare
say
you
be
already
,
of
an
occurrence
which
cast
a
shade
over
his
early
life
,
blight
his
character
,
and
endanger
his
personal
safety
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
dreadful
accusation
.
<EOS>
but
I
believe
,
nay
,
I
be
sure
,
it
be
unfounded
.
<EOS>
dark
suspicion
attach
to
a
romish
priest
of
the
name
of
Checkley
.
<EOS>
He
,
I
believe
,
be
beyond
the
reach
of
human
justice
.
<EOS>
Erring
Sir
Piers
be
,
undoubtedly
.
<EOS>
but
I
trust
he
be
more
weak
than
sinful
.
<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
think
he
be
the
tool
of
other
,
especially
of
the
wretch
I
have
name
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
easy
to
perceive
how
that
incomprehensible
lunatic
,
Peter
Bradley
,
have
obtain
an
ascendancy
over
him
.
<EOS>
His
daughter
,
you
be
aware
,
be
Sir
Piers
's
mistress
.
<EOS>
Our
friend
be
now
go
,
and
with
him
let
us
bury
his
offence
,
and
the
remembrance
of
them
.
<EOS>
that
his
soul
be
heavily
laden
,
would
appear
from
your
account
of
his
last
moment
;
yet
I
fervently
trust
that
his
repentance
be
sincere
,
in
which
case
there
be
hope
of
forgiveness
for
him
.
'
<EOS>
at
what
time
soever
a
sinner
shall
repent
him
of
his
sin
,
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
,
I
will
blot
out
all
his
wickedness
out
of
my
remembrance
,
saith
the
Lord

'
<EOS>
Heaven
's
mercy
be
great
than
man
's
sin

<EOS>
and
there
be
hope
of
salvation
even
for
Sir
Piers

<EOS>
""I
trust
<EOS>
so
,
indeed
,
"
say
Titus
,
with
emotion
;
"
and
as
to
repeat
a
syllable
of
what
I
have
just
say
,
devil
a
word
more
<EOS>
will
I
utter
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
My
lip
shall
be
shut
and
seal
,
as
close
as
one
of
Mr.
Coates
's
bond
,
for
ever
and
a
day
:
but
I
think
it
just
right
to
make
you
acquaint
with
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
have
dismiss
the
bad
for
ever
,
I
be
ready
to
speak
of
Sir
Piers
's
good
quality
,
and
not
few
they
be
.
<EOS>
what
be
there
become
a
gentleman
that
he
could
not
do
,
I
would
like
to
know
?
<EOS>
Could
not
he
hunt
as
well
as
ever
a
one
in
the
county
?
<EOS>
and
have
not
he
as
good
a
pack
of
hound
?
<EOS>
Could
not
he
shoot
as
well
,
and
fish
as
well
,
and
drink
as
well
,
or
better?—only
<EOS>
he
could
not
carry
his
wine
,
which
be
his
misfortune
,
not
his
fault
.
<EOS>
and
be
not
he
always
ready
to
ask
a
friend
to
dinner
with
him
?
<EOS>
and
do
not
he
give
him
a
good
dinner
when
he
come
,
bar
the
cross
-
cup
afterwards
?
<EOS>
and
have
not
he
everything
agreeable
about
him
,
except
his
wife
?
<EOS>
which
be
a
great
drawback
.
<EOS>
and
with
all
his
peculiarity
and
humor
,
be
not
he
as
kind
-
hearted
a
man
as
need
be
?
<EOS>
and
an
Irishman
at
the
core
?
<EOS>
and
so
,
if
he
wern't
<EOS>
dead
,
I
would
say
long
life
to
him
!
<EOS>
but
as
he
be
,
here
be
peace
to
his
memory!"At
<EOS>
this
juncture

a
knocking
be

at

door

some

have
vainly
try

<EOS>
JACK
PALMER
be
a
good
-
humored
,
good
-
looking
man
,
with
immense
bushy
,
red
whisker
,
a
freckled
,
florid
complexion
,
and
sandy
hair
,
rather
inclined
to
scantiness
towards
the
scalp
of
the
head
,
which
garnish
the
nape
of
his
neck
with
a
ruff
of
crisp
little
curl
,
like
the
ring
on
a
monk
's
shave
crown
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
this
tendency
to
baldness
,
Jack
could
not
be
more
than
thirty
,
though
his
look
be
some
five
year
in
advance
.
<EOS>
His
face
be
one
of
those
inexplicable
countenance
,
which
appear
to
be
proper
to
a
peculiar
class
of
man
—
a
regular
Newmarket
physiognomy
—
compound
chiefly
of
cunning
and
assurance
;
not
low
cunning
,
nor
vulgar
assurance
,
but
crafty
sporting
subtlety
,
careless
as
to
result
,
indifferent
to
obstacle
,
ever
on
the
alert
for
the
main
chance
,
game
and
turf
all
over
,
eager
,
yet
easy
,
keen
,
yet
quiet
.
<EOS>
He
be
somewhat
showily
dress
,
in
such
wise
that
he
look
half
like
a
fine
gentleman
of
that
day
,
half
like
a
jockey
of
our
own
.
<EOS>
His
nether
man
appear
in
well
-
fit
,
well
-
wear
buckskin
,
and
boot
with
top
,
not
unconscious
of
the
saddle
;
while
the
airy
extravagance
of
his
broad
-
skirt
,
sky
-
blue
ride
coat
,
the
richness
of
his
vest
—
the
pocket
of
which
be
beautifully
exuberant
,
accord
to
the
mode
of
1737—the
smart
luxuriance
of
his
cravat
,
and
a
certain
curious
taste
in
the
size
and
style
of
his
button
,
proclaim
that
,
in
his
own
esteem
at
least
,
his
person
do
not
appear
altogether
unworthy
of
decoration
;
nor
,
in
justice
to
Jack
,
can
we
allow
that
he
be
in
error
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
model
of
a
man
for
five
foot
ten
;
square
,
compact
,
capitally
build
in
every
particular
,
except
that
his
leg
be
slightly
imbowe
,
which
defect
probably
arise
from
his
be
almost
constantly
on
horseback
;
a
sort
of
exercise
in
which
Jack
greatly
delight
,
and
be
account
a
superb
rider
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
indeed
,
his
daring
horsemanship
,
upon
one
particular
occasion
,
when
he
have
outstrip
a
whole
field
,
that
have
procure
him
the
honor
of
an
invitation
to
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
who
he
be
,
or
whence
he
come
,
be
a
question
not
easily
answer
—
Jack
,
himself
,
evade
all
solution
to
the
inquiry
.
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
never
trouble
his
head
about
the
matter
:
he
be
a
"
deuced
good
fellow
—
rode
well
,
and
stand
on
no
sort
of
ceremony
;
"
that
be
enough
for
him
.
<EOS>
nobody
else
know
anything
about
him
,
save
that
he
be
a
capital
judge
of
horseflesh
,
keep
a
famous
black
mare
,
and
attend
every
hunt
in
the
West
Riding
—
that
he
could
sing
a
good
song
,
be
a
choice
companion
,
and
could
drink
three
bottle
without
feel
the
bad
for
them
.
<EOS>
sensible
of
the
indecorum
that
may
attach
to
his
appearance
,
Dr.
Small
have
hastily
lay
down
his
pipe
,
and
arrange
his
wig
.
<EOS>
but
when
he
see
who
be
the
intruder
,
with
a
grunt
of
defiance
he
resume
his
occupation
,
without
return
the
bow
of
the
latter
,
or
bestow
further
notice
upon
him
.
<EOS>
nothing

at

Jack
greet
Titus
cordially
,
and
carelessly
salute
Mr.
Coates

himself
into

<EOS>
He
next
fill
a
tumbler
of
claret

and
drain
it
at
a
draught

<EOS>
"Have

ask
Titus

notice
the
dusty

reply
Palmer

I
have

by

he
be
as
fine
a

""So

rejoin
Titus

for
,
in
the
first
place

I
have
a
foolish
partiality
for
poacher

be
sorry
when
any

,
in

there
be
no

I
take
it

this
Bradley

Coates

<EOS>

I
remember
her
quite
well

I
be

I

me
see

something

odd

coate

shake

May
I
ask
the
reason

your
inquiry?""nothing
further

simple
curiosity

Jack

enjoy
the
consternation
of
his
companion

<EOS>
"
It
be
,
as
you
say
,
a
long
while
since

it
be
singular
how
that
sort

thing
be
remember
.
<EOS>
one
would
think
people
have
something
else
to
do
than
talk
of
one

private
affair
for
ever

<EOS>
for
my
part
,
I
despise
such
tattle
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
person
in
the
neighborhood
who
still
say
it
be
an
awkward
business
.
<EOS>
amongst
other
,
I
have
hear
that
this
very
Luke
Bradley
talk
in
pretty
plain
term
about
it

<EOS>
""doe
<EOS>
he

indeed

Coates

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
so
much
the
bad
for
him

<EOS>
let
me
once
lay
hand
upon
him

I
will
put
a
gag
in
his
mouth

shall
spoil
his
talking
in
the
future

<EOS>
""that
be
precisely
the
point
I
desire

arrive

reply
Jack

I
advise
you
by
all
mean

accomplish
that
,
for
the
sake
of
the
family

<EOS>
nobody
like
his
friend
to
be
talk
about

I
would
settle
the
matter
amicably

be
I
you

just
let

go
his

<EOS>
what
the
deuce
be
that

<EOS>
in
my
opinion

he
have
'
turn
stag

already

<EOS>
at

he
will
pay
deer
for
his

may
depend

it

all

""Well
,
well

"

Jack

"
no
offence

<EOS>
I
only
mean
to
offer
a
suggestion

<EOS>
I
think
the
family
,
young
Sir
Ranulph
,
I
mean
,
might
not
like
the
story
to
be
revive

<EOS>
as
to
Lady
Rookwood

she
do
not

I
suppose

care
much
about

<EOS>
indeed
,
if
I
have
be
rightly
inform
,
she
bear
this
youngster

good
-
will
to
begin
with
,
and
have
try
hard
to
get
him
out
of
the
country

<EOS>

,
as
you
say
,
what
do
it
signify
what
he
say

<EOS>
he
can
only
talk
.
<EOS>
Sir
Piers
be
dead
and
go
.
<EOS>
""Humph
!
"
muttered
coate
,
peevishly
.
"But
<EOS>
it
do
seem
a
little
hard
,
that
a

a
bit

I
tell

on

when
all
be

""The
<EOS>
fine
of

with

enthusiasm

be
those
bird
of
the
night
,
and
minion
of
the
moon
,
whom
we
call
,
most
unjustly
,
poacher

<EOS>
They
be
,
after
all
,
only
professional
sportsman

make
a
business
of
what
we
make
a
pleasure
;
a
nightly
pursuit
of
what
be
to
us
a
daily
relaxation
;
there
be
the
main
distinction
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
rest
,
it
be
all
in
idea
;
they
merely
thin
an
overstock
park
,
as
you
would
reduce
a
plethoric
patient
,
doctor
;
or
as
you
would
work
a
moneyed
client
,
if
you
get
him
into
Chancery
,
Mister
Attorney
.
<EOS>
and
then
how
much
more
scientifically
and
systematically
they
set
to
work
than
we
amateur
do
!
<EOS>
how
noiselessly
they
bag
a
hare
,
smoke
a
pheasant
,
or
knock
a
buck
down
with
an
air
-
gun
!
<EOS>
how
independent
be
they
of
any
license
,
except
that
of
a
good
eye
,
and
a
swift
pair
of
leg
!
<EOS>
how
unnecessary
be
it
for
them
to
ask
permission
to
shoot
over
Mr.
So

I
have
some
thought

in

highly
respectable

Mr.
Coates

<EOS>
turn
very
gravely

coate

bridle
up

I
make
no

you

next
maintain

gentleman

<EOS>
""most
<EOS>
undoubtedly

reply
Palmer
,
in
the
same
grave
tone
,
which
may
have
pass
for
banter

have
Jack
ever
banter

<EOS>
"
I
will
maintain
and
prove
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
how
he
can
be
otherwise
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
necessary
for
a
man
to
be
a
gentleman
before
he
can
turn
highwayman
,
as
it
be
for
a
doctor
to
have
his
diploma
,
or
an
attorney
his
certificate
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
fine
gentleman
of
their
day
,
as
Captain
Lovelace
,
Hind
,
Hannum
,
and
Dudley
,
be
eminent
on
the
road
,
and
they
set
the
fashion
.
<EOS>
ever
since
their
day
a
real
highwayman
would
consider
himself
disgrace
,
if
he
do
not
conduct
himself
in
every
way
like
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
there
be
pretender
in
this
line
,
as
in
everything
else
.
<EOS>
but
these
be
only
exception
,
and
prove
the
rule
.
<EOS>
what
be
the
distinguish
characteristic
of
a
fine
gentleman?—perfect
knowledge
of
the
world
—
perfect
independence
of
character
—
notoriety
—
command
of
cash
—
and
inordinate
success
with
the
woman
.
<EOS>
You
grant
all
these
premise
?
<EOS>
first
,
then
,
it
be
part
of
a
highwayman
's
business
to
be
thoroughly
acquaint
with
the
world
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
easy
and
pleasantest
fellow
go
.
<EOS>
there
be
Tom
King
,
for
example
:
he
be
the
handsome
man
about
town
,
and
the
best
-
breed
fellow
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
then
whose
inclination
be
so
uncontrolled
as
the
highwayman
's
,
so
long
as
the
mopuse
last
?
<EOS>
who
produce
so
great
an
effect
by
so
few
words?—'stand
and
DELIVER
!
'
<EOS>
be
sure
to
arrest
attention
.
<EOS>
every
one
be
captivate
by
an
address
so
take
.
<EOS>
as
to
money
,
he
win
a
purse
of
a
hundred
guinea
as
easily
as
you
would
the
same
sum
from
the
faro
table
.
<EOS>
and
wherein
lie
the
difference
?
<EOS>
only
in
the
name
of
the
game
.
<EOS>
who
so
little
need
of
a
banker
as
he
?
<EOS>
all
he
have
to
apprehend
be
a
check
—
all
he
have
to
draw
be
a
trigger
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
woman
,
they
dote
upon
him
:
not
even
your
red
-
coat
be
so
successful
.
<EOS>
look
at
a
highwayman
mount
on
his
flying
steed
,
with
his
pistol
in
his
holster
,
and
his
mask
upon
his
face
.
<EOS>
what
can
be
a
more
gallant
sight
?
<EOS>
the
clatter
of
his
horse
's
heel
be
like
music
to
his
ear
—
he
be
in
full
quest
—
he
shout
to
the
fugitive
horseman
to
stay
—
the
other
fly
all
the
faster
—
what
chase
can
be
half
so
exciting
as
that
?
<EOS>
suppose
he
overtake
his
prey
,
which
ten
to
one
he
will
,
how
readily
his
summon
to
deliver
be
obey
!
<EOS>
how
satisfactory
be
the
appropriation
of
a
lusty
purse
or
corpulent
pocket
-
book!—getting
<EOS>
the
brush
be
nothing
to
it
.
<EOS>
how
tranquilly
he
depart
,
take
off
his
hat
to
his
accommodate
acquaintance
,
wish
him
a
pleasant
journey
,
and
disappear
across
the
heath
!
<EOS>
England
,
sir
,
have
reason
to
be
proud
of
her
highwayman
.
<EOS>
They
be
peculiar
to
her
clime
,
and
be
as
much
before
the
brigand
of
Italy
,
the
contrabandist
of
Spain
,
or
the
cut
-
purse
of
France
—
as

shake
off

easily

I

not

painful

my

<EOS>
"when
<EOS>
I

I
pass
a

alone

in

<EOS>
a

introduce

during

I

by

singular
beauty

the
young

have
a
peculiar
and
inexpressible
charm
to
me

from
its
marked
resemblance
to
the
portrait
of
the
Lady
Eleanor
Rookwood
,
whose
charm
and
unhappy
fate
<EOS>
I
have
so
often
dwell
upon

deplore

there

"
continue
Ranulph

point
to
it

<EOS>
"
look
at
it
,
and
you
have
the
fair
creature
I
speak
of
before
you
;
the
color
of
the
hair
—
the
tenderness
of
the
eye
.
<EOS>
no
—
the
expression
be
not
so
sad
,
except
when
——
but
no
matter
!
<EOS>
I
recognize
her
feature
at
once
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
strike
me

that
upon
the
mention
of
my

the
party
betray
some
surprise
,
especially
the
eld
lady
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
be
so
attract
by
the
beauty
of
the
daughter
,
the
effect
of
which
upon
me
seem
rather
the
fulfilment
of
a
predestined
event
,
originate
in
the
strange
fascination
which
the
family
portrait
have
work
in
my
heart

than
the
operation
of
what
be
call
'
love
at
first
sight
,
'
that
I
be
insensible
to
the
agitation
of
the
mother

<EOS>
in
vain
I
endeavor
to
rally
myself
;
my
effort
at
conversation
be
fruitless
;
I
could
not
talk
—
all
I
could
do
be
silently
to
yield
to
the
soft
witchery
of
those
tender
eye
;
my
admiration
increase
each
instant
that
I
gaze
upon
them
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
accompany
them
home

<EOS>
attract
as
by
some
irresistible
spell

I
could
not
tear
myself
away

so
that
,
although
I
fancy
I
could
perceive
symptom
of
displeasure
in
the
look

both
the
mother

,
regardless

I
venture

uninvited

to
enter
the

<EOS>
in
order
to
shake
off
the
restraint
which
I
feel

impose
,
I
find
it
absolutely
necessary
to
divest
myself
of
bashfulness
,
and
to
exert
such
conversational
power
as
I
possess

<EOS>
I
succeed
so
well
that
the
discourse
soon
become
lively

animated

what
chiefly
delight
me

,
that
she

become
radiant

for
some
explanation
of
the
resemblance

which
I
have
just
allude

the
fitting
moment
have
,
I
conceive
,
arrive
.
<EOS>
I
call
attention
to
a
peculiar
expression
in
the
feature
of
Miss
Mowbray
,
and
then
instance
the
likeness
that
subsist
between
her
and
my
ancestress

'
<EOS>
It
be
the
more
singular
,
'
I

,
turn
to
her
mother

'
because
there
could
have
be
no
affinity

that
I
be
aware
of
,
between

the

be
really
surprising

<EOS>
'—'it

answer
Mrs.

there
be

<EOS>
'"words

astonishment

<EOS>
I
gaze
at
Mrs.

whether
I

her
speech

whether
I

shape
the
sound

to
suit
my
own
quick

passionate
conception

<EOS>

no

<EOS>
I
read
in
her
calm
,
collected
countenance
—
in
the
downcast
glance
,
and
sudden
sadness
of
Eleanor
,
as
well
as
in
the
changed

haughty
demeanor
of
the

I

hear
her
rightly

venture
now
to
interrupt

to
express
a
hope

she
would
suffer
an
acquaintance

keep
up

forth
her

it
eagerly

It
be
the
happy
moment
of
my

"I

this

receive
from

Her
farewell
word
assure
me

that
it
be
indifferent

her
whether
we
meet
again

<EOS>
then
be
it

I
watch
each
rosy
tint
reflect
upon

now
fade
into
yellow
—
now
shine
silvery
white

I
notice
the
mystic
mingling

twilight

the

I
be
astonish
at
the
sight

I
have
perceive
no

have
hear
no

towards
me

be
satisfied

no

an

time
can
never

It

It

<EOS>
Dr.

stand

and
,
under
the
direction
of
Peter
Bradley
,
the
tenantry
and
household
be
form
into
a
wide
half
-
moon
across
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
hush
of
expectation
,
as
Dr.
Small
look
gravely
round
;
and
even
Jack
Palmer
,
who
be
as
little
likely
as
any
man
to
yield
to
an
impression
of
the
kind
,
feel
himself
move
by
the
scene
.
<EOS>
the
very
orthodox
Small
,
as
be
well
known
to
our
reader
,
hold
everything
savor
of
the
superstition
of
the
Scarlet
Woman
in
supreme
abomination
;
and
,
entertain
such
opinion
,
it
can
scarcely
be
suppose
that
a
funeral
oration
would
find
much
favor
in
his
eye
,
accompany
,
as
it
be
,
with
the
accessory
of
censer
,
candle
,
and
cup
;
all
evidently
derive
from
that
period
when
,
under
the
three
-
crown
pontiff
's
sway
,
the
shave
priest
pronounce
his
benediction
<EOS>
o'er
the
dead
,
and
release
the
penitent
's
soul
from
purgatorial
flame
,
while
he
heavily
mulct
the
price
of
his
redemption
from
the
possession
of
his
successor
.
<EOS>
Small
resent
the
idea
of
tread
in
such
step
,
as
an
insult
to
himself
and
his
cloth
.
<EOS>
be
he
,
the
intolerant
of
Papistry
,
to
tolerate
this
?
<EOS>
be
he
,
who
could
not
endure
the
odor
of
Catholicism
,
to
have
his
nostril
thus
pollute
—
his
garment
thus
defile
by
actual
contact
with
it
?
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
think
of
:
and
he
have
formally
signify
his
declination
to
Mr.
Coates
,
when
a
little
conversation
with
that
gentleman
,
and
certain
weighty
consideration
therein
hold
forth
—
the
advowson
of
the
church
of
Rookwood
reside
with
the
family
—
and
represent
by
him
,
as
well
as
the
placing
in
juxtaposition
of
penalty
to
be
incur
by
refusal
,
that
the
scruple
of
Small
give
way
;
and
,
with
the
good
grace
he
could
muster
,
very
reluctantly
promise
compliance
.
<EOS>
with
these
feeling
,
it
will
be
readily
conceive
that
the
doctor
be
not
in
the
good
possible
frame
of
mind
for
the
delivery
of
his
exhortation
.
<EOS>
His
spirit
have
be
ruffle
by
a
variety
of
petty
annoyance
,
amongst
the
great
of
which
be
the
condition
to
which
the
good
cheer
have
reduce
his
clerk
,
Zachariah
Trundletext
,
whose
reel
eye
,
pendulous
position
,
and
open
mouth
proclaim
him
absolutely
incapable
of
office
.
<EOS>
Zachariah
be
,
in
consequence
,
dismiss
,
and
Small
commence
his
discourse
unsupported
.
<EOS>
but
as
our
recording
it
would
not
probably
conduce
to
the
amusement
of
our
reader
,
whatever
it
may
to
their
edification
,
we
shall
pass
it
over
with
very
brief
mention
.
<EOS>
suffice
it
to
say
,
that
the
oration
be
so
thickly
interstrewn
with
lengthy
quotation
from
the
fathers,—chrysostomus
,
Hieronymus
,
Ambrosius
,
Basilius
,
Bernardus
,
and
the
rest
,
with
whose
recondite
Latinity
,
notwithstanding
the
clashing
of
their
opinion
with
his
own
,
the
doctor
be
intimately
acquaint
,
and
which
he
moreover
delight
to
quote,—that
<EOS>
his
auditor
be
absolutely
mystified
and
perplex
,
and
probably
not
without
design
.
<EOS>
countenance
of
such
amazement
be
turn
towards
him
,
that
Small
,
who
have
a
keen
sense
of
the
ludicrous
,
could
scarcely
forbear
smile
as
he
proceed
;
and
if
we
could
suspect
so
grave
a
personage
of
waggery
,
we
should
almost
think
that
,
by
way
of
retaliation
,
he
have
palm
some
abstruse
,
monkish
epicedium
upon
his
astounded
auditor
.
<EOS>
the
oration
conclude
,
biscuit
and
confectionery
be
,

to
old
observance
,

such
of
the
tenantry

them

<EOS>
the
serving
of
the
grace

cup
,
which
ought
to
have
form
part
of
the
duty
of
Zachariah
,
have
he
be
capable
of
office
,
fall
to
the
share
of
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
the
bowl
be
kiss
,
first
by
Ranulph
,
with
lip
that
tremble
with
emotion
,
and
afterward
by
his
surround
friend
;
but
no
drop
be
taste
—
a
circumstance
which
do
not
escape
Peter
's
observation
.
<EOS>
proceed
to
the
tenantry
,
the
first
in
order
happen
to
be
Farmer
Toft
.
<EOS>
Peter
present
the
cup
,
and
as
Toft
be
about
to
drain
a
deep
draught
of
the
wine
,
Peter
whisper
in
his
ear
,
"
take
my
advice
for
once
,
Friend
Toft
,
and
do
not
let

bubble

<EOS>
for

<EOS>
and
the
sexton
pass
onwards

LIGHTS
stream
through
the
chancel
window
as
the
sexton

the
churchyard

darkly
define
all
the
ramify
tracery
of
the
noble
gothic
arch

and
illumine
the
gorgeous
dye
of
its
richly

stain

profusely
decorate
with
the
armorial
bearing
of
the
founder
of
the

the
many
alliance
of
his
descendant

<EOS>
the
sheen
of
their
blazonry

bright
in

<EOS>
open
the
gate

in
that
direction

Peter
become
aware
of
a
dark
figure
,
envelop
in
a
large
black
cloak
,
and
cover
with
a
slouched
hat
,
stand
at
some
distance
,
between
the
window
and
the
tree
,
and
so
intervene
as
to
receive
the
full
influence
of
the
stream
of
radiance
which
serve
to
dilate
its
almost
superhuman
stature
.
<EOS>
the
sexton

<EOS>
the
figure
remain
stationary
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
singular
both
in

the
person
.
<EOS>
Peter
's
curiosity
be
speedily
arouse
,
and
,
familiar
with
every
inch
of
the
churchyard
,
he
determine
to
take
the
near
cut
,
and
to
ascertain
to
whom
the
mysterious
cloak
and
hat
belong
.
<EOS>
make
his
way
over
the
undulate
grave
,
and
instinctively
round
the
headstone
that
intercept
his
path
,
he
quickly
draw
near
the
object
of
his
inquiry
.
<EOS>
from
the
moveless
posture
it
maintain
,
the
figure
appear
to
be
unconscious
of
Peter
's
approach
.
<EOS>
to
his
eye
it
seem
to
expand
as
he
advance
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
almost
close
upon
it
,
when
his
progress
be
arrest
by
a
violent
grasp
lay
on
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
He
start
,
and
utter
an
exclamation
of
alarm
.
<EOS>
at
this
moment
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
illumine
the
whole
churchyard

and
Peter
then
think
he
behold
,
at
some
distance
from
him
,
two
other
figure

upon

it
may
be

a

<EOS>
the
garb
of
these
figure
,
so
far
as
it
could
be
discern
through
the
drench
rain
,
be
fantastical
in
the
extreme
.
<EOS>
the
foremost
seem
to
have
a
long
white
beard
descend
to
his
girdle
.
<EOS>
little
leisure
,
however
,
be
allow
Peter
for
observation

<EOS>
the
vision

<EOS>
He
rub
his
eye

<EOS>
the
muffled
figure
have
vanish
,
and
not
a
trace
could
be
discover
of
the
mysterious
coffin
-
bearer
,
if
such
they
be
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
have
I
see
?
"
<EOS>
mentally
ejaculated
Peter
:
<EOS>
"
be
this
sorcery
or
treachery
,
or
both
?
<EOS>
no
body
-
snatcher
would
visit
this
place
on
a
night
like
this
,
when
the
whole
neighborhood
be
arouse

<EOS>
Can
it
be
a
vision
I
have

?
<EOS>
Pshaw
!
<EOS>
shall
I
juggle
myself
as
I
deceive
these
hind

<EOS>
It
be
no
bearded
demon
that
I
beheld
,
but
the
gipsy
patrico
,
Balthazar
.
<EOS>
I
know
him
at
once

<EOS>
but
what
mean
that
muffle
figure

and
whose
arm
could
it
have
be
that

<EOS>
what
if
Lady

have
give
order

removal

Susan

<EOS>
no

<EOS>
besides
,
I
have
the
key
of

and
there
be
hundred
now
in
the
church

would
permit
no
such
desecration

<EOS>
I
be
perplex
to
think
what
it
can
mean

I

<EOS>
say

he
hasten
to
the
church

after
wring
the
wet
from
his
clothe

as

shake
the
moisture
from

curly
hide

and
doff
his

he
enter
the
holy

<EOS>
the
interior
seem

blaze

the

<EOS>
some
few

probably

<EOS>
near

the
harsh

<EOS>
Peter
start
as

relax
his
hold
upon

<EOS>
there
be
a
whisper
amongst
the
party

<EOS>
a
light
step
be
hear
advance
towards
him
;
and
ere
the

could
sufficiently
recover

open
the
door

a
female
figure

"She

the

whether

a
tone
as
remarkable
for
its
sadness
as
for
its
force
and
fervor

<EOS>
there
be
a
tear
in
every
eye
—
a
cloud
on
every
brow

<EOS>
brightly
illumine
as

there

some
recess

heavy
pillar

and
in
one
of
these

by
her
mother

stand
Eleanor
,
a
weep
witness
of
the
scene

<EOS>
She
behold
the
coffin
silently
bear
along
;
she
see
one
dark
figure
slowly
follow
;
she
know
those
pale

oh

<EOS>
He
must
,
indeed

have
suffer
—
deeply
suffer
;
and
her
heart
tell
her
that
his
sorrow
have
be
for
her

<EOS>
many

wistful
look

besides
,
be
direct
to
the
principal
figure
in
this
ceremonial
,
Ranulph
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
prey
to
unutterable
anguish
of
soul
;
his
heart
bleed
inwardly
for
the
father
he
have
lose
.
<EOS>
mechanically
follow
the
body
down
the
aisle
,
he
have
take
his
station
near
it
,
gaze
with
confused
vision
upon
the
bystander
;
have
listen
,
with
a
sad
composure
,
to
the
expressive
delivery
of
Small
,
until
he
read—"For
man
walketh
in
a
vain
shadow
,
and
disquieteth
himself
in
vain
;
he
heapeth
up
rich

and
can
not
tell
who
shall
gather
them

<EOS>
""Verily
!
"
exclaim
a
deep
voice
;
and
Ranulph
,
look
round
,
meet
the
eye
of
Peter
Bradley
fix
full
upon
him
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
evidently
not
the
sexton
who
have
speak
.
<EOS>
Small
continue
the
service
.
<EOS>
He
arrive
at
this
verse
:
"
Thou
hast
set
our
misdeed
before
thee
;
and
our
secret
sin
in
the
light
of
thy
countenance
.
<EOS>
""even
<EOS>
so
!
<EOS>
"
exclaim
the
voice
;
and
as
Ranulph
raise
his
eye
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
,
he
think
he
see
a
dark
figure
,
muffle
in
a
cloak
,
disappear
behind
one
of
the
pillar
.
<EOS>
He
bestow
,
however
,
at
the
moment
,
little
thought
upon
this
incident
.
<EOS>
His
heart
melt
within
him
;
and
lean
his
face
upon
his
hand
,
he
weep
aloud
.
<EOS>
"command
<EOS>
yourself
,
I
entreat
of
you
,
my

Sir
Ranulph

"
say
Dr.
Small
,
as
soon
as
the
service

"
and
suffer
this
melancholy
ceremonial
to
be
complete
.
<EOS>
"
say
which
,
he
gently
withdraw
Ranulph
from
his
support
,
and
the
coffin
be
lower
into
the
vault

<EOS>
Ranulph
remain
for
some
time
in
the
extremity
of
sorrow

<EOS>
when
he

the

They
advance
towards
him

<EOS>
an
exclamation
of
surprise

joy
burst
from
his
lip

"Eleanor!""Ranulph!""Is

They

<EOS>
sad
—
sad
be
the

<EOS>
no

keen

if
life
hath
a

more
exquisite
than

if
felicity
hath
one
drop
more
racy
than
the
rest
in
her
honeyed
cup
<EOS>
,
it
be
the
happiness
enjoy
in
such
a
union
as
the
present
.
<EOS>
to
say
that
he
be
as
one
raise
from
the
depth
of
misery
by
some
angel
comforter
,
be
a
feeble
comparison
of
the
transport
of
Ranulph
.
<EOS>
to
paint
the
thrilling
delight
of
Eleanor
—
the
tremble
tenderness
—
the
fond
abandonment
which
vanquish
all
her
maiden

some

at

a

scarce

his

He
contrive

to
slide
off

shape
his

course
in
a
more
secure
direction

<EOS>
He
who
have
wander
amidst
the
Alps
must
have
often
have
occasion
to
witness
the
wonderful
surefootedness
of
that
mountain
pilot
,
the
mule
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
remark
how
,
with
tenacious
hoof
,
he
will
claw
the
rock
,
and
drag
himself
from
one
impend
fragment
to
another
,
with
perfect
security
to
his
rider
;
how
he
will
breast
the
roar
current
of
air
,
and
stand
unshrinking
at
the
verge
of
almost
unfathomable
ravine

he
be
timid

perpendicular
side

be
tremendous

Peter
watch
them
in
their

with
some
admiration

and
with
much
contempt

<EOS>
"He

he

<EOS>
as

<EOS>
"So

"It

comparatively
smooth
travelling

they

it

Luke

"Dick

"But
<EOS>
Dick
may

into

to

,

leap

"I
tell
you
so
—
he

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
well

if
you

Patting

She

"Now

urge
his

by

across

the

they
be
in

<EOS>
for
some
time
they
ride
along
the
bank

stream

a
sound
at
length
catch
the
quick
ear
of
the
highwayman

"Hist

cry
he
;

some
one
sing

do
you
hear
it?""I

Luke

blood
rush
to
his

<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
could
give

with
a
knowing
look

<EOS>
"
<EOS>

She

She

no

She

some
such

They

Her

when

confident
in

in

he
feel

He

possess

he

<EOS>
Turpin

the

It
be
a
subject
well
worthy
of
inquiry
,
to
trace
this
decline

fall
of
the

of

its
remoter

why

,
purse
to

and
mail
be
as
plentiful

it
be
worth
serious
investigation
,
we
repeat

to
ascertain
why
,
with
the
good
material
imaginable
for
a

of

we
have

whatever

the
chance

success
incomparably
great

<EOS>
We
throw
out
this
hint
,
without
a
doubt
of
see
it
follow
up
.
<EOS>
probably
the
solution
of
our
inquiry
may
be
,
that
the
supply
be
great
than
the
demand
;
that
,
in
the
present

have

His

he
change
his

renew
his
attack
in
other
quarter

that
he
seem

with
ubiquity,—his

his
resolution

above

his

His

perpetrate
with
a
suddenness
of

that
the

the
only
way

the

be
the

breach

when

Zoroaster

,
a

stalwart
rogue

whose
superior
strength

stature
—

<EOS>
strange
to

,
also
,
for
one
of
that
lithe
race
,
his

be
heavy

hebetudinous
;
the
consequence
,
no

,
of
habitual
intemperance

<EOS>
like
Cribb

he
wax
obese

<EOS>
there
be
a
kind
of
mock
state
in

as
he
place
himself
before
Turpin
,
and
with
his

hand
twist
up
the

gown

while

thrust

which

<EOS>
Turpin
's
attention
,
however
,
be
chiefly
direct
towards
his
neighbor
,
the
ruffler
,
in
whom
he
recognize
a
famous
impostor
of
the
day
,
with
whose
history
he
be
sufficiently
well
acquaint
to
be
able
at
once
to
identify
the
individual
.
<EOS>
We
have
before
state
,
that
a
magnificent
coal
-
black
beard
decorate
the
chin
of
this
worthy
;
but
this
be
not
all
—
his
costume
be
in
perfect
keeping
with
his
beard
,
and
consist
of
a
very
theatrical
-
looking
tunic
,
upon
the
breast
of
which
be
embroider
,
in
golden
wire
,
the
maltese
cross
;
while
over
his
shoulder
be
throw
the
fold
of
an
ample
cloak
of
tyrian
hue
.
<EOS>
to
his
side
be
girt
a
long
and
doughty
sword
,
which
he
term
,
in
his
knightly
phrase
,
Excalibur
;
and
upon
his
profuse
hair
rest
a
hat
as
broad
in
the
brim
as
a
spanish
sombrero
.
<EOS>
exaggerate
as
this
description
may
appear
,
we
can
assure
our
reader
that
it
be
not
overdraw
;
and
that
a
counterpart
of
the
sketch
we
have
give
of
the
ruffler
certainly
"
strut
his
hour
"
upon
the
stage
of
human
life
,
and
that
the
very
ancient
and
discriminate
city
of
Canterbury
—
to
which
be
all
honor
—
be
his
theatre
of
action
.
<EOS>
His
history
be
so
far
curious
,
that
it
exemplify
,
more
strongly
than
a
thousand
discourse
could
do
,
how
prone
we
be
to
be
govern
by
appearance
,
and
how
easily
we
may
be
make
the
dupe
of
a
plausible
impostor
.
<EOS>
be
it
remember
,
however
,
that
we
treat
of
the
eighteenth
century
,
before
the
march
of
intellect
have
commence
;
we
be
much
too
know
to
be
similarly
practise
upon
in
these
enlighten
time
.
<EOS>
but
we
will
let
the
knight
of
Malta
,
for
such
be
the
title
assume
by
the
ruffler
,
tell
his
own
story
in
his
own
way
hereafter
;
content
ourselves
with
the
moral
precept
we
have
already
deduce
from
it
.
<EOS>
next
to
the
knight
of
Malta
stand
the
whip
-
jack
,
habit
in
his
sailor
gear
—
stripe
shirt
and
dirty
canvas
trouser
;
and
adjoin
him
be
the
palliard
,
a
loathsome
tatterdemalion
,
his
dress
one
heap
of
rag
,
and
his
discolored
skin
one
mass
of
artificial
leprosy
and
imposthume
.
<EOS>
as
Turpin
's
eye
shift
from
one
to
another
of
these
figure
,
he
chance
upon
an
individual
who
have
be
long
endeavor
to
arrest
his
attention
.
<EOS>
this
personage
be
completely
in
the
background
.
<EOS>
all
that
Dick
could
discern
of
him
be
a
brown
curly
head
of
hair
,
carelessly
arrange
in
the
modern
mode
;
a
handsome
,
impudent
,
sun
-
freckle
face
,
with
one
eye
closed
,
and
the
other
occupy
by
a
break
bottle
-
neck
,
through
which
,
as
a
substitute
for
a
lorgnette
,
the
individual
reconnoiter
him
.
<EOS>
a
cocked
hat
be
place
in
a
very
dégagée
manner
under
his
arm
,
and
he
hold
an
ebony
cane
in
his
hand
,
very
much
in
the
style
of
a
"
fassionable
,
"
as
the
French
have
it
,
of
the
present
day
.
<EOS>
this
glimpse
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
Turpin
.
<EOS>
He
recognize
in
this
whimsical
personage
an
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Jerry
Juniper
be
what
the
classical
Captain
Grose
would
designate
a
"
gentleman
with
three
out

"
and
,
although
he
be
not
entirely

Jerry

with

with

it

then

perhaps
,
the

be
upon

if
a

one
condescend
to

with
him

what
marvel
if
he
should
sometimes
slightly
transgress
the

<EOS>
these
aberration

however

be
trifle

altogether
he

so
well

that

singular

<EOS>
all

fruitless

tired

so
inconsistent

immoderately

He
shake

MischiefsAre
like
the
visit
of

They
never
come
to
prey
upon
us
single.—Devil
's
Law
Case
.
<EOS>
the
course
of
our
tale
return
now
to
Eleanor
Mowbray
.
<EOS>
after
she
have
part
from
Ranulph
Rookwood
,
and
have
watch
him
disappear
beneath
the
arch
of
the
church
porch
,
her
heart
sink
,
and
,
draw
herself
back
within
the
carriage
,
she
become
a
prey
to
the
most
poignant
affliction
.
<EOS>
in
vain
she
endeavor
to
shake
off
this
feeling
of
desolation
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
.
<EOS>
despair
have
take
possession
of
her
;
the
magic
fabric
of
delight
melt
away
,
or
only
gleam
to
tantalize
,
at
an
unreachable
distance
.
<EOS>
a
presentiment
that
Ranulph
would
never
be
her
have
take
root
in
her
imagination
,
and
overshadow
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
while
Eleanor
pursue
this
train
of
reflection
,
the
time
insensibly
wear
away
,
until
the
sudden
stoppage
of
the
carriage
arouse
the
party
from
their
meditation
.
<EOS>
major
Mowbray
perceive
that
the
occasion
of
the
halt
be
the
rapid
advance
of
a
horseman
,
who
be
near
them
at
full
speed
.
<EOS>
the
appearance
of
the
rider
be
somewhat
singular
,
and
may
have
create
some
uneasiness
as
to
the
nature
of
his
approach
,
have
not
the
major
immediately
recognize
a
friend
;
he
be
,
nevertheless
,
greatly
surprised
to
see
him
,
and
turn
to
Mrs.
Mowbray
to
inform
her
that
Father
Ambrose
,
to
his
infinite
astonishment
,
be
come
to
meet
them
,
and
appear
,
from
his
manner
,
to
be
the
bearer
of
unwelcome
tiding
.
<EOS>
Father
Ambrose
be
,
perhaps
,
the
only
be
whom
Eleanor
dislike
.
<EOS>
She
have
feel
an
unaccountable
antipathy
towards
him
,
which
she
could
neither
extirpate
nor
control
,
during
their
long
and
close
intimacy
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
necessary
to
mention
that
her
religious
culture
have
be
in
accordance
with
the
tenet
of
the
Romish
Church
,
in
whose
faith
—
the
faith
of
her
ancestry
—
her
mother
have
continue
;
and
that
Father
Ambrose
,
with
whom
she
have
first
become
acquaint
during
the
residence
of
the
family
near
Bordeaux
,
be
her
ghostly
adviser
and
confessor
.
<EOS>
an
Englishman
by
birth
,
he
have
be
appoint
pastor
to
the
diocese
in
which
they
dwelt
,
and
be
,
consequently
,
a
frequent
visitor
,
almost
a
constant
inmate
of
the
château
;
yet
though
duty
and
respect
would
have
prompt
her
to
regard
the
father
with
affection
,
Eleanor
could
never
conquer
the
feeling
of
dislike
and
distrust
which
she
have
at
first
entertain
towards
him
;
a
dislike
which
be
increase
by
the
strange
control
in
which
he
seem
to
hold
her
mother
,
who
regard
him
with
a
veneration
approach
to
infatuation
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
therefore
,
with
satisfaction
that
she
bid
him
adieu
.
<EOS>
He
have
,
however
,
follow
his
friend
to
England
under
a
feign
name
as
—
be
a
recusant
romish
priest
,
and
suppose
to
have
be
engage
in
certain
jesuitical
plot
,
his
return
to
his
own
country
be
attend
with
considerable
risk
—
,
and
have
now
remain
domesticate
with
them
for
some
month
.
<EOS>
that
he
have
be
in
some
way
,
in
early
life
,
connect
with
a
branch
of
the
house
of
Rookwood
<EOS>
,
Eleanor
be
aware
—
she
fancy
he
may
have
be
engage
in
political
intrigue
with
Sir
Reginald
,
which
would
have
well
accord
with
his
ardent
,
ambitious
temperament
—
,
and
the
knowledge
of
this
circumstance
make
her
doubly
apprehensive
lest
the
nature
of
his
present
communication
should
have
reference
to
her
lover
,
towards
whose
cause
the
father
have
never
be
favorable
,
and
respect
whose
situation
he
may
have
make
some
discovery
,
which
she
fear
he
may
use
to
Ranulph
's
disadvantage

wrap
in
a
long
black
cloak

with
a
broad

closely
over
his
brow

impossible
to

further
of
the

and

the
circumstance
of
his
height

which
be
remarkable

until
he

the
carriage
window

his
hat
,
he
disclose
a
head
that
Titian
may
have
paint
,
and
which
,
arise
from
the
dark
drapery
,
look
not
unlike
the
visage
of
some
grave
and
saturnine
Venetian
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
venerable
expanse
of
forehead
,
thinly
scatter
with
hair
,
tower
over
black
pent

house
-
like
brow
,
which
,
in
their
turn

shadow

the
temple

hollow

and
blue
vein
may
be
trace
beneath
the
sallow
skin
;
the
cheek

bone
be
high
,
and
there
be
something
in
the
face
that
speak
of
self
-
mortification
;
while
the
thin
livid
lip
,
closely
compress
,
and
the
austere
and
sinister
expression
of
his
countenance
,
show
that
his
self
-
abasement
,
if
he
have
ever
practise
it
,
have
scarcely
prostrate
the
demon
of
pride
,
whose
dominion
may
still
be
trace
in
the
line
and
furrow
of
his
haughty
physiognomy
.
<EOS>
the
father
look
at
Mrs.
Mowbray
,
and
then
glance
suspiciously
at
Eleanor
.
<EOS>
the
former
appear
to
understand
him
.
<EOS>
"You
would
say
a
word
to
me
in
private
,
"
say
Mrs.
Mowbray
;
"
shall
I
descend?"the
priest
bow
assent
.
<EOS>
"It
be
not
to
you
alone
that
my
mission
extend
,
"
say
he
,
gravely
;
"
you
be
all
in
part
concerned
;
your
son
have
better
alight
with
you
.
<EOS>
""instantly

"
reply
the
major
.
<EOS>
"
if
you
will
give
your
horse
in
charge
to
the
postilion

we
will
attend
you
at

<EOS>
"with
a
feeling
of
renew
apprehension

<EOS>
,
she
know
not
why
,
with
Ranulph
,
Eleanor
behold
her
relative
descend
from
the
carriage

and
,
in
the
hope
of
gain
some
clue
from
their
gesture
to
the
subject
of
their
conversation
,
she
watch
their
motion
as
narrowly
as
her
situation

<EOS>
from
the
earnest
manner
of
the
priest
,
and
the
interest
his
narrative
seem
to
excite
in
his
hearer
,
it
be
evident
that
his
communication
be
of
importance

accompany
by
Father
Ambrose

Mrs.

to
the

"The

at
the
moment
the
clatter
of
a
horse

the
sound

for
the
dexterity

<EOS>
—
DICK

<EOS>
a
fine
fellow
with
a
genius
extensive
enough
to
have
effect
universal
reformation
have
be
doom
to
perish
by
the
halter
.
<EOS>
but
do
not
such
a
man
's
renown
extend
through
century
and
ten
of
century
,
while
many
a
prince
would
be
overlook
in
history
be
it
not
the
historian
's
interest
to
increase
the
number
of
his
page
?
<EOS>
Nay
,
when
the
traveller
see
a
gibbet
,
do
he
not
exclaim
,
"
that
fellow
be
no
fool
!
"
and
lament
the
hardship
of
the
times?—schiller
:
<EOS>
the
Robbers
.
<EOS>
TURPIN
's
quick
eye
range
over
the
spread
sward
in
front
of
the
ancient
priory
,
and
his
brow
become
contract
.
<EOS>
the
feeling
,
however
,
be
transient
.
<EOS>
the
next
instant
see
him
the
same
easy
,
reckless
being
he
have
be
before
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
more
paleness
in
his
cheek
than
usual
;
but
his
look
be
keen
,
and
his
knee
involuntarily
clasp
the
saddle
more
firmly
.
<EOS>
no
other
symptom
of
anxiety
be
perceptible
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
no
impeachment
to
Dick
's
valor
be
it
necessary
to
admit
that
a
slight
tremor
cross
him
as
he
scan
the
formidable
array
of
his
opponent
.
<EOS>
the
admission
be
needless
.
<EOS>
Dick
himself
would
have
be
the
last
man
to
own
it
;
nor
shall
we
do
the
memory
of
our
undaunted
highwayman
any
such
injustice
.
<EOS>
Turpin
be
intrepid
to
a
fault
.
<EOS>
He
be
rash
;
apt
to
run
into
risk
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
get
out
of
them
:
danger
be
his
delight
,
and
the
degree
of
excitement
be
always
in
proportion
to
the
peril
incur
.
<EOS>
after
the
first
glance
,
he
become
,
to
use
his
own
expressive
phrase
,
"
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
;
"
and
continue
,
as
long
as
they
permit
him
,
like
a
skilful
commander
,
calmly
to
calculate
the
numerical
strength
of
his
adversary
,
and
to
arrange
his
own
plan
of
resistance
.
<EOS>
this
troop
of
horseman
,
for
such
it
be
,
may
probably
amount
in
the
aggregate
to
twenty
man
,
and
present
an
appearance
like
that
of
a
strong
muster
at
a
rustic
fox
-
chase
,
due
allowance
be
make
for
the
various
weapon
of
offence
;
to
-
wit
:
<EOS>
naked
saber
,
firelock
,
and
a
world
of
huge
horse
-
pistol
,
which
the
present
field
carry
along
with
them
.
<EOS>
this
resemblance
be
heighten
by
the
presence
of
an
old
huntsman
and
a
gamekeeper
or
two
,
in
scarlet
and
green
jacket
,
and
a
few
yelping
hound
that
have
follow
after
them
.
<EOS>
the
majority
of
the
crew
consist
of
sturdy
yeoman
;
some
of
whom
,
mount
upon
wild
,
unbroken
colt
,
have
pretty
life
of
it
to
maintain
their
seat
,
and
curvet
about
in
"
most
admired
disorder
;
"
other
be
seat
upon
more
docile
,
but
quite
as
provoking
specimen
of
the
cart
-
horse
breed
,
whose
sluggish
side
,
reckless
alike
of
hobnailed
heel
or
ash
sapling
,
refuse
to
obey
their
rider
'
intimation
to
move
;
while
other
again
,
bring
stiff
,
wrong
-
head
pony
to
the
charge
—
obstinate
,
impracticable
little
brute
,
who
seem
to
prefer
revolving
on
their
own
axis
,
and
describe
absurd
rotatory
motion
,
to
proceed
in
the
direct
and
proper
course
point
out
to
them
.
<EOS>
Dick
could
scarcely
forbear
laughing
at
these
ridiculous
manoeuvre
;
but
his
attention
be
chiefly
attract
towards
three
individual
,
who
be
evidently
the
leader
of
this
warlike
expedition
.
<EOS>
in
the
thin
,
tall
figure
of
the
first
of
these
he
recognize
Ranulph
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
with
the
feature
and
person
of
the
second
of
the
group
he
be
not
entirely
unacquainted
,
and
fancy
—
nor
incorrectly
fancy
—
that
his
military
bearing
,
or
,
as
he
would
have
express
it
,
"
the
soldier
-
like
cut
of
his
jib
,
"
could
belong
to
no
other
than
Major
Mowbray
,
whom
he
have
once
ease
of
a
purse
on
Finchley
Common
.
<EOS>
in
the
round
,
rosy
countenance
and
robustious
person
of
the
last
of
the
trio
he
discover
his
ancient
ally
,
Titus
Tyrconnel
.
<EOS>
"Ah
,
Titus
,
my
jewel
<EOS>
,
be
you
there
?
"
<EOS>
exclaim
Dick
,
as
he
distinguish
the
Irishman
.
<EOS>
"
come
,
I
have
one
friend
among
them
whom
I
may
welcome
.
<EOS>
so
,
they
see
me
now
.
<EOS>
off
they
come
,
pell

mell
.
<EOS>
back
,
Bess
,
back!—slowly
,
wench
,
slowly
—
there
—
stand
!
"
<EOS>
and
Bess
again
remain
motionless
.
<EOS>
the
report
of
Turpin
's
pistol
reach
the
ear
of
the
troop
;
and
as
all
be
upon
the
alert
,
he
have
scarcely
present
himself
at
the
gateway
,
when
a
loud
shout
be
raise
,
and
the
whole
cavalcade
gallop
towards
him
,
create
,
as
may
be
imagine
,
the
wild
disorder
;
each
horseman
yelling
,
as
he
near
the
arch
,
and
get
involve
in
the
press
occasion
by
the
unexpected
concentration
of
force
at
that
point
,
while
oath
and
blow
,
kick
and
cuff
,
be
reciprocate
with
such
hearty
good
-
will
,
that
,
have
Turpin
ever
read
Ariosto
or
Cervantes
,
or
hear
of
the
discord
of
King
Agramante
's
camp
,
this
mêlée
must
have
strike
him
as
its
realization
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
entertain
little
apprehension
of
the
result
,
he
shout
encouragement
to
them
.
<EOS>
scarcely
,
however
,
have
the
foremost
horseman
disentangle
himself
from
the
crowd
,
and
,
struggle
to
the
door
,
be
in
the
act
of
level
his
pistol
at
Turpin
's
head
,
when
a
well
-
direct
ball
pierce
the
brain
of
his
charger
,
and
horse
and
man
roll
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
vow
vengeance
,
a
second
succeed
,
and
be
in
like
manner
compel
to
bite
the
dust
.
<EOS>
"that
will
let
Old
Peter
know
that
Ranulph
Rookwood
be
at
hand
,
"
exclaim
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
throw
away
another
shot
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
scene
at
the
archway
be
now
one
of
complete
confusion
.
<EOS>
terrify
by
the
shot
,
some
of
the
boor
would
have
draw
back
,
while
other
,
in
mid
career
,
advanced
,
and
propel
them
forwards
.
<EOS>
It
be
like
the
meeting
of
two
tide
.
<EOS>
here
and
there
,
regardless
of
the
bit
,
and
scare
by
the
firing
,
a
wild
colt
break
all
bound
,
and
,
hurl
his
rider
in
the
air
,
dart
off
into
the
green
;
or
,
in
another
case
,
rush
forward
,
and
encounter
the
prostrate

stumble

and
precipitate

master

over

the
very
foot
of
his
enemy

<EOS>
during
all
this
tumult
,
a
few
shot
be
fire
at
the
highwayman
,
which
,
without
do
him
a
jot
of
mischief
,
tend
materially
to
increase
their
own
confusion
.
<EOS>
the
voice
of
Turpin
be
now
hear
above
the
din
and
turmoil
to
sound
a
parley
;
and
as
he
appear
disposed
to
offer
no
opposition
,
some
of
his
antagonist
venture
to
raise
themselves
from
the
ground
,
and
to
approach
him
.
<EOS>
"I

"I

I

from

look

out

I

""Some

thrust
his

quietly

shout

Hurrah!""Hurrah

reply
the
crowd
,
at
the
top
of
their
voice
.
<EOS>
Ranulph
Rookwood
and
his
companion
hear
this
shout
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Coates
have
already
explain
the
stratagem
practise
upon
them
by
the
wily
highwayman
,
as
well
as
the
perilous
situation
in
which
he
himself
have
be
place
;
and
they
be
in
the
act
of
return
to
make
good
his
capture
,
when
the
loud
shout
of
the
crew
arrest
them
.
<EOS>
from
the
clamor
,
it
be
evident
that
considerable
reinforcement
must
have
arrive
from
some
unlooked
-
for
quarter
;
and
,
although
burn
to
be
avenge
upon
the
audacious
highwayman
,
the
major
feel
it
would
be
a
task
of
difficulty
,
and
that
extreme
caution
could
alone
ensure
success
.
<EOS>
with
difficulty
restrain
the
impatience
of
Ranulph
,
who
could
scarcely
brook
these
few
minute
of
needful
delay
,
Major
Mowbray
give
particular
instruction
to
each
of
the
man
in
detail
,
and
cause
several
of
them
to
dismount
.
<EOS>
by
this
arrangement
Mr.
Coates
find
himself
accommodate
with
a
steed
and
a
pair
of
pistol
,
with
which
latter
he
vow
to
wreak
his
vengeance
upon
some
of
his
recent
tormentor
.
<EOS>
after
a
short
space
of
time
occupy
in
this
manner
,
the
troop
slowly
advance
towards
the
postern
,
in
much
well
order
than
upon
the
previous
occasion
;
but
the
stout
of
them
quail
as
they
catch
sight
of
the
numerous
gipsy
-
gang
draw
out
in
battle
array
within
the
abbey
wall
.
<EOS>
each
party
scan
the
other
's
movement
in
silence
and
wonder
,
anxiously
await
,
yet
in
a
measure
dread
,
their
leader
's
signal
to
begin
.
<EOS>
that
signal
be
not
long

<EOS>
a
shot
from
the
rank

Rookwood
do
instant
and
bitter
execution

Rob

either
party

<EOS>
but
a
rush
be
make
by
a
detachment
of
horse
,
head
by
Major
Mowbray
,
the
conflict
soon
become
more
serious
.
<EOS>
the
gipsy
,
after
the
first
fire
,
throw
aside
their
pistol
,
and
fight
with
long
knife
,
with
which
they
inflict
desperate
gash
,
both
on
man
and
horse

<EOS>
Major
Mowbray
be
slightly
wound
in
the
thigh
,
and
his
steed
receive
the
blow

<EOS>
luckily
for
the

Ranulph
Rookwood
be
at
hand
,
and
with
the
butt

end
of
a
heavy

handle
pistol
fell
the
ruffian
to
the
earth
,
just
as
he
be
upon
the
point
of
repeat
the
thrust
.
<EOS>
Turpin
,
meanwhile
,
have
take
comparatively
a
small
share
in
the
conflict
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
content
himself
with
act
upon
the
defensive
,
and
except
in
the
case
of
Titus
Tyrconnel
,
whom
,
espy
amidst
the
crowd

he
have
considerably
alarm
by

a
bullet
through

He
also
succeed
in
unhorse

by
hurl

with
great
dexterity

empty
pistol
at
his
head

<EOS>
though
apparently
unconcerned
in
the
skirmish
,
he
do
not
flinch
from
it

but
keep
his
ground
unyieldingly
.
<EOS>
"

seem
to
bear
;
for
amid
the
shower
of
bullet

many

he
come
off
unhurt

"He

It
be
no

bring
him
down

but
,
by

<EOS>
he
be
spoil
my
good

<EOS>
there
be
a

<EOS>
""your

some
satisfaction

coate

"The

strife
continue
to
rage
without

there
be
now
several
ghastly
evidence

its
fury

in
the
shape

gape
wound
flood
the
turf
with
gore

it
be
still
difficult
to
see
upon
which
side
victory
would
eventually
declare
herself
.
<EOS>

by

the
great

maintain
their
ground

terrific

get
a

gripe

their
lithe
antagonist

deliver
a

with
their
ox

they
seldom

make
good
the
advantage

superior
weight

It

pretty
well

so

up
;

some
acquaintance
with

out
at

D'Osyndar

give

unlimited
use
of
his

and
only
require
a
little
trifling
assistance
in

<EOS>
He
have
a
grand
scheme
in

,
in
the
execution
of
which
they
could
mainly
assist
him
.
<EOS>
Jerry
be
a
Greek
by
nature
,
and
could
land
a
flat
as
well
as
the
good
of
them

<EOS>
Zoroaster
be
just
the
man
to
lose
a
fight
;
or
,
in
the
language
of
the
Fancy
,
to
play

no

Tom

<EOS>
He

them

<EOS>
We
will
now
proceed
to
reconnoitre
Jerry
's
opposite
neighbor
,
who
be
,
however
,
no
other
than
that
Upright
Man
,
the
Magus
Zoroaster
,
that
great
name
.
<EOS>
change
as
be
Juniper
,
the
Magus
be
yet
more
whimsically
metamorphose
.
<EOS>
some
trace
of
Jerry
still
remain
,
but
not
a
vestige
be
leave
of
the
original
Dimber
Damber
.
<EOS>
His
tawny
mother
have
not
know
her
son
.
<EOS>
this
alteration
,
however
,
be
not
owe
to
change
of
dress
;
it
be
the
result
of
the
punishment
he
have
receive
at
the
"
set
-
to
"
at
the
priory
.
<EOS>
not
a
feature
be
in
its
place
;
his
swollen
lip
trespass
upon
the
precinct
of
his
nose
;
his
nose
trod
hard
upon
his
cheek
;
while
his
cheek
again
,
not
to
be
behind
the
rest
,
rise
up
like
an
apple
-
dumpling
under
his
single
eye,—single
,
we
say
—
for
,
alas
!
<EOS>
there
be
no
speculation
in
the
other
.
<EOS>
His
dexter
daylight
be
utterly
darken
,
and
,
indeed
,
the
orb
that
remain
be
as
sanguinary
a
luminary
as
ever
struggle
through
a
London
fog
at
noonday
.
<EOS>
to
borrow
a
couplet
or
so
from
the
laureate
of
the
Fancy:——One
of
his
peeper
be
puton
the
bankruptcy
list
,
with
his
shop
window
shut
,
while
the
other
make
nearly
as
tag
-
rag
<EOS>
a
show
,
all
rimmed
round
with
black
like
the
Courier
in
woe
.
<EOS>
one
black
patch
decorate
his
rainbow
-
color
cheek
;
another
adorn
his
chin
;
a
grinder
have
be
dislodge
,
his
pipe
take
possession
of
the
aperture
.
<EOS>
His
toggery
be
that
of
a
member
of
the
prize
-
ring
;
what
we
now
call
a
"
belcher
"
bind
his
throat
;
a
spot
fogle
bandage
his
jobbernowl
,
and
shade
his
right
peeper
,
while
a
white
beaver
crown
the
occiput
of
the
Magus
.
<EOS>
and
though
,
at
first
sight
,
there
would
appear
to
be
some
incongruity
in
the
association
of
such
a
battered
character
as
the
Upright
Man
with
his
smart
companion
,
the
reader
's
wonder
will
rapidly
diminish
,
when
he
reflect
that
any
distinguished
P.
C.
man
can
ever
find
a
ready
passport
to
the
most
exclusive
society
.
<EOS>
view
in
this
light
,
Zoroaster
's
familiarity
with
his
swell
acquaintance
occasion
no
surprise
to
old
Simon
Carr
,
the
bottle
-
nosed
landlord
of
the
Falstaff
,
who
be
a
man
of
discernment
in
his
way
,
and
know
a
thing
or
two
.
<EOS>
despite
such
striking
evidence
to
the
contrary
,
the
Magus
be
perfectly
at
his
ease
,
and
sacrifice
as
usual
to
the
god
of
flame
.
<EOS>
His
mithra
,
or
pipe
,
the
symbol
of
his
faith
,
be
zealously
place
between
his
lip
,
and
never
do
his
Chaldean
,
bactrian
,
persian
,
pamphylian
,
proconnesian
,
or
babylonian
namesake
<EOS>
,
whichever
of
the
six
be
the
true
Zoroaster
—
videBayle,—respire
more
fervently
at
the
altar
of
fire
,
than
our
Magus
at
the
end
of
his
enkindle
tube
.
<EOS>
in
his
creed
we
believe
Zoroaster
be
a
dualist
,
and
believe
in
the
co
-
existence
and
mystical
relation
of
the
principle
of
good
and
ill
;
his
pipe
be
his
Yezdan
,
or
benign
influence
;
his
empty
pouch
his
Ahreman
,
or
the
devil
.
<EOS>
We
shall
not
pause
to
examine
his
tenet
;
we
meddle
with
no
man
's
religious
opinion
,
and
shall
leave
the
Magus
to
the
enjoyment
of
his
own
sentiment
,
be
they
what
they
may
.
<EOS>
one
guest
alone
remain
,
and
him
we
shall
briefly
dismiss
.
<EOS>
the
reader
,
we
imagine
,
will
scarcely
need
to
be
tell
who

<EOS>
Turpin
,
the
reader
already
know
,
be
a
crack
rider
;
he
be
the
crack
rider
of
England
of
his
time
,
and
,
perhaps
,
of
any
time
.
<EOS>
the
craft
and
mystery
of
jockeyship
be
not
so
well
understand
in
the
eighteenth
as
it
be
in
the
nineteenth
century
;
man
treat
their
horse
differently
,
and
few
ride
them
as
well
as
many
ride
now
,
when
every
youngster
take
to
the
field
as
naturally
as
if
he
have
be
breed
a
Guacho
.
<EOS>
Dick
Turpin
be
a
glorious
exception
to
the
rule
,
and
anticipate
a
later
age
.
<EOS>
He
ride
wonderfully
lightly
,
yet
sit
his
saddle
to
perfection
,
distribute
the
weight
so
exquisitely
that
his
horse
scarcely
feel
his
pressure
;
he
yield
to
every
movement
make
by
the
animal
,
and
become
,
as
it
be
,
part
and
parcel
of
itself
;
he
take
care
Bess
should
be
neither
strain
nor
wrung
.
<EOS>
freely
,
and
as
lightly
as
a
feather
,
be
she
bear
along
;
beautiful
be
it
to
see
her
action
—
to
watch
her
style
and
temper
of
cover
the
ground
;
and
many
a
first
-
rate
Meltonian
may
have
get
a
wrinkle
from
Turpin
's
seat
and
conduct
.
<EOS>
We
have
before
state
that
it
be
not
Dick
's
object
to
ride
away
from
his
pursuer
—
he
could
have
do
that
at
any
moment
.
<EOS>
He
like
the
fun
of
the
chase
,
and
would
have
be
sorry
to
put
a
period
to
his
own
excitement
.
<EOS>
confident
in
his
mare
,
he
just
keep
her
at
such
speed
as
should
put
his
pursuer
completely
to
it
,
without
in
the
slight
degree
inconvenience
himself
.
<EOS>
some
judgment
of
the
speed
at
which
they
go
may
be
form
,
when
we
state
that
little
well

an

<EOS>
how
Turpin
become
possessed
of
her
be
of
little
consequence
.
<EOS>
We
never
hear
that
he
pay
a
heavy
price
for
her
;
though
we
doubt
if
any
sum
would
have
induce
him
to
part
with
her
.
<EOS>
in
color
,
she
be
perfectly
black
,
with
a
skin
smooth
on
the
surface
as
polished
jet
;
not
a
single
white
hair
could
be
detect
in
her
satin
coat

<EOS>
in

she

magnificent
.
<EOS>
every
point
be
perfect
,
beautiful
,
compact
;
modelled
,
in
little
,
for
strength
and
speed
.
<EOS>
Arched
be
her
neck
,
as
that
of
the
swan
;
clean
and
fine
be
her
low
limb
,
as
those
of
the
gazelle
;
<EOS>
round
and
sound
as
a

be
her
carcase
,
and
as
broad
as

yard

<EOS>
her

look
at
the

palpable
through
the
veined
limb

<EOS>
She
be
build
more
for
strength
than
beauty
,
and
yet
she
be
beautiful
.
<EOS>
look
at
that
elegant
little
head
;
those
thin
,
taper
ear
,
closely
place
together
;
that
broad
,
snorting
nostril
,
which
seem
to
snuff
the
gale
with
disdain
;
that
eye

glowing
and
large
as

<EOS>

<EOS>
Behold
her

<EOS>
how
gracefully
she

<EOS>
She

off!—no
eagle
on

could
skim
the

more
swiftly

<EOS>
be
she
not
superb
?
<EOS>
as

her
temper

the

be
not

gentle

<EOS>
a
child
may
guide
her

<EOS>
but
hark
back
to
Dick
Turpin
.
<EOS>
We
leave
him
rattle
along
in
superb
style
,
and
in
the
high
possible
glee
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
in
fact
,
be
otherwise
than
exhilarate
;
nothing
be
so
wildly
intoxicate
as
a
mad
gallop

<EOS>
We
seem
to
start
out
of
ourselves
—
to
be
endue
,
for
the
time
,
with
new
energy
.
<EOS>
Our
thought
take
wing
rapid
as
our
steed
.
<EOS>
We
feel
as
if
his
fleetness
and
boundless
impulse
be
for
the
moment
our
own
.
<EOS>
We
laugh
;
we
exult
;
we
shout
for
very
joy
.
<EOS>
We
cry
out
with
mephistophele
,
but
in
anything
but
a
sardonic
mood
,
"
what
I
enjoy
with
spirit
,
be
it
the
less
my

<EOS>
if

I

twenty

<EOS>
"
these
be
Turpin
's
sentiment
precisely
.
<EOS>
give
him
four
leg
and
a
wide
plain
,
and
he
need
no
Mephistopheles
to
bid
him
ride
to

We

It

strain
in

a
dulness
in

a
laxity
in

irritate
by
the
keen
atmosphere

hardly
enable
him
to
distinguish

or
even
to
guide

It

that
Bess
suddenly
flounder

She

up

would
make
a

bade
me
keep
it
for

great
occasion

I
have
never

I
will
try
it
now

his

from

but
again
on
his
courser
's
back
,
he
care
not
for
anything
.
<EOS>
once
more
,
at
a
gallant
pace
,
he
traverse
the
bank
of
the
Don
,
skirt
the
field
of
flax
that
bind
its
side
,
and
hurry
far
more
swiftly
than
its
current
to
its
confluence
with
the
Aire
.
<EOS>
Snaith
be
past

<EOS>
He
be
on
the
road
to
Selby
when
dawn
first
begin
to
break
.
<EOS>
here
and
there
a
twitter
be
hear
in
the
hedge
;
a
hare
run
across
his
path
,
gray
-
look
as
the
morning
self
;
and
the
mist
begin
to
rise
from
the
earth
.
<EOS>
a
bar
of
gold
be
draw
against
the
east
,
like
the
roof
of
a
gorgeous
palace
.
<EOS>
but
the
mist
be
heavy
in
this
world
of
river
and
their
tributary
stream
.
<EOS>
the
Ouse
be
before
him
,
the
Trent
and
Aire
behind
;
the
Don
and
Derwent
on
either
hand
,
all
in
their
way
to
commingle
their
current
ere
<EOS>
they
form
the
giant
Humber
.
<EOS>
amid
a
region
so
prodigal
of
water
,
no
wonder
the
dew
fall
thick
as
rain
.
<EOS>
here
and
there
the
ground
be
clear
;
but
then
again
come
a
volley
of
vapor
,
dim
and
palpable
as
smoke
.
<EOS>
while
involve
in
one
of
these
fog
,
Turpin
become
aware
of
another
horseman
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
to
discern
the
feature
of
the
rider
,
but
his
figure
in
the
mist
seem
gigantic
;
neither
be
the
color
of
his
steed
distinguishable
.
<EOS>
nothing
be
visible
except
the
meagre
-
looking
,
phantom
-
like
outline
of
a
horse
and
his
rider
,
and
,
as
the
unknown
ride
upon
the
turf
that
edge
the
way
,
even
the
sound
of
the
horse
's
hoofs
be
scarcely
audible
.
<EOS>
Turpin
gaze
,
not
without
superstitious
awe
.
<EOS>
once
or
twice
he
essay
to
address
the
strange
horseman
,
but
his
tongue
clave
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
He
fancy
he
discover
in
the
mist
-
exaggerate
lineament
of
the
stranger
a
wild
and
fantastic
resemblance
to
his
friend
Tom
King
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
Tom
,
"
think
Turpin
;
"
he
be
come
to
warn
me
of
my
approach

.
<EOS>
I
will
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
terror
o'ermastered
his
speech
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
force
out
a
word
,
and
thus
side
by
side
they
ride
in
silence
.
<EOS>
quake
with
fear
he
would
scarcely
acknowledge
to
himself
,
Dick
watch
every
motion
of
his
companion
.
<EOS>
He
be
still
,
stern
,
spectre
-
like
,
erect
;
and
look
for
all
the
world
like
a
demon
on
his
phantom
steed
.
<EOS>
His
courser
seem
,
in
the
indistinct
outline
,
to
be
huge
and
bony
,
and
,
as
he
snort
furiously
in
the
fog
,
Dick
's
heated
imagination
supply
his
breath
with
a
due
proportion
of
flame
.
<EOS>
not
a
word
be
speak
—
not
a
sound
hear
,
save
the
sullen
dead
beat
of
his
hoofs
upon
the
grass
.
<EOS>
It
be
intolerable
to
ride
thus
cheek
by
jowl
with
a
goblin
.
<EOS>
Dick
could
stand
it
no
longer
.
<EOS>
He
put
spur
to
his
horse
,
and
endeavor
to
escape
.
<EOS>
but
it
may
not
be

<EOS>
the
stranger
,
apparently
without
effort

be
still
by
his
side

Bess

foot

in

master

apprehension

be

<EOS>
by

by

however
,
the
atmosphere
become
clear
.
<EOS>
bright
quiver
beam
burst
through
the
vaporous
shroud
,
and
then
it
be
that
Dick
discover
that
the
apparition
of
Tom
King
be
no
other
than
Luke
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
He
be
mount
on
his
old
horse

Rook

and
look
grim
and
haggard
as

crowing

"Sir

<EOS>
a
moment

afterwards
he
rise

shake
his

and
flounder
heavily
towards
the

and
such
be
the
chilling
effect
of
this
sudden
immersion

that
Mr.

now
think
much
more
of

<EOS>
the
hut
on
Thorne
Waste
,
to
which
we
have
before
incidentally
allude
,
and
whither
we
be
now
about
to
repair
,
be
a
low
,
lone
hovel
,
situate
on
the
bank
of
the
deep
and
oozy
Don
,
at
the
eastern
extremity
of
that
extensive
moor
.
<EOS>
ostensibly
its
owner
fulfil
the
duty
of
ferryman
to
that
part
of
the
river
;
but
as
the
road
which
skirt
his
tenement
be
little
frequented
,
his
craft
be
,
for
the
most
part
,
allow
to
sleep
undisturbed
in
her
mooring
.
<EOS>
in
reality
,
however
,
he
be
the
inland
agent
of
a
horde
of
smuggler
who
infest
the
neighboring
coast
;
his
cabin
be
their
rendezvous
;
and
not
unfrequently
,
it
be
say
,
the
depository
of
their
contraband
good
.
<EOS>
Conkey
Jem
—
so
be
he
call
by
his
associate
,
on
account
of
the
slawkenbergian
promontory
which
decorate
his
countenance
—
have
be
an
old
hand
at
the
same
trade
;
but
have
return
from
a
seven
year
'
leave
of
absence
from
his
own
country
,
procure
by
his
lawless
life
,
now
manage
matter
with
more
circumspection
and
prudence
,
and
have
never
since
be
detect
in
his
former
illicit
traffic
;
nor
,
though
so
marvellously
gifted
in
that
particular
himself
,
be
he
ever
know
to
nose
upon
any
of
his
accomplice
;
or
,
in
other
word
,
to
betray
them
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
his
hut
be
a
sort
of
asylum
for
all
fugitive
from
justice
;
and
although
the
sanctity
of
his
wall
would
,
in
all
probability
,
have
be
little
regard
,
have
any
one
be
,

within
them
,
yet
,
strange
to
say
,
even
if
a
robber
have
be
track
—
as
it
often
chance
—
to
Jem
's
immediate
neighborhood
,
all
trace
of
him
be
sure
to
be
lose
at
the
ferryman
's
hut
;
and
further
search
be
useless
.
<EOS>
within

the
hut
present
such

<EOS>
notwithstanding
the
grotesque

of
his
exaggerated

Jem

at

repulsive

and

and

suspiciously

while

Jem

and
what
with
his
width
of
shoulder
and
shortness
of
neck
,
his
figure
look
as
square
and
as
solid
as
a

<EOS>
His
throat
and
hirsute
chest
,
constantly
expose
to
the
weather
,
have
acquire
a
glowing
tan
,
while
his
arm
,
uncover

and

,
like

almost

a
knot
of

the
concentrated
force

which
few

<EOS>
It
be

on
the
stroke
of
midnight

Jem

who

extend
upon
the
floor

suddenly
arouse
by

warning
impulse

never

of

<EOS>
but
it
be
not

retire
for
the
night
that
the

enter
his
dormitory

<EOS>
beside

crazy
couch
stand
a

feebly

"Why

this

indeed
to

"Why

reluctantly

"
since
you

I

"During

complete

<EOS>
I
have
only
to
regret
the
absence
of
my
friend
,
Mr.
Coates
,
at
this
momentous
conjuncture
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
loss
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
he
inherit
from
his
father
a
taste
for
thief
-
taking
,
which
he
be
at
present
indulging
,
to
the
manifest
injury
of
his
legitimate
practice
.
<EOS>
hark
!
<EOS>
I
hear
Ranulph
's
step
in
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
He
will
tell
us
the
result
of
his
final
interview
.
<EOS>
I
come
to
give
you
advice
,
my
dear
,
"
add
the
doctor
in
a
low
tone
to
Eleanor
;
"
but
I
find
you
need
it
not

<EOS>
Whoso

<EOS>
I
be
glad
you
do
not
split
upon
the
rock

have
strand
half
your

<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
moment
Ranulph
Rookwood
enter
the
room
,
follow
by
Handassah

who
take
her
station
at

manner

<EOS>
"what
have
happen
?
"
<EOS>
ask
Dr.
Small
and
Mrs.
Mowbray
in
the
same
breath
.
<EOS>
Ranulph
hesitate
for
a
moment
in
his
answer
,
during
which
space
he
regard
Eleanor
with
the
deep
anxiety
,
and
seem
revolving
within
himself
how
he
could
frame
his
reply
in
such
way
as
should
be
least
painful
to
her
feeling
;
while
,
with
instinctive
apprehension
of
come
misfortune
,
Miss
Mowbray
eagerly
second
the
inquiry
of
her
friend
.
<EOS>
"It
be
with
great
pain
,
"
say
he
,
at
length
,
in
a
tone
of
despondency

not
unmingle
with
displeasure
,
"
that
I
be
oblige
to
descant
upon
the
infirmity
of
a
parent
,
and
to
censure
her
conduct
as
severely
as
I
may
do
now
.
<EOS>
I
feel
the
impropriety
of
such
a
step
,
and
I
would
willingly
avoid
it
,
could
I
do
so
in
justice
to
my
own
feeling
—
and
especially
at
a
moment
like
the
present
—
when
every
hope
of
my
life
be
fix
upon
unite
myself
to
you
,
dear
Eleanor
,
by
tie
as
near
as
my
own
to
that
parent

<EOS>

the
interview
which
I
have
just
have
with
Lady
Rookwood
—
bitter
and
heart
-
breaking
as
it
have
be
—
compel
me
to
reprobate
her
conduct
in
the
strong
term
,
as
harsh
,
unjust
,
and
dishonorable
;
and
if
I
could
wholly
throw
off
the
son
,
as
she
avow
she
have
throw
off
the

I
should
unhesitatingly
pronounce
it

malediction

indignity

apprehend

as
I
before
say
,
you
do
not
know
my

;
nor
could
it
enter
into
any

regulate
imagination

the
extremity

which
the
violence

<EOS>
the
term
upon
which
you
meet
together
will
not
escape

I
need

recall
to
your

her
haughtiness

her
coldness

<EOS>
that
coldness
have
since
ripen

distrust

the
match

would
now
utterly
set
aside

be
it

do
so

<EOS>
Whence
this
alteration
in
her
view
have
arise

I
have
no

ascertaining
;
it

give
a

her
action

wish

answer

Luke
neither

still
maintain
his
hold

gaze
searchingly
upon

as
if
spell

bind

could
not
withdraw
her
eye
from

nothing
more
terribly
impressive
could
be
conceive
than
Luke

whole
appearance

<EOS>
harass
and
exhaust
by
the
life
he
have
recently
lead
;
deprive
almost
of
natural
rest
;
goad
by
remorse
,
his
frame
be
almost
wear
to
the
bone
,
while
his
countenance
,
once
dark
and
swarthy

be
now
blanch
and
colorless
as
marble
.
<EOS>
this
pallid
and
deathlike
hue
be
,
in
all
probability
,
owe
to
the
loss
of
blood
he
have
sustain
from
the
wound
inflict
by
Major
Mowbray
,
with
the
stain
of
which
his
apparel
be

staunch

the
effusion
have
be
sufficient

His

with
their

fire

nay
,
they
look
dark

large
from
his
exceed
paleness

such
intense
mental

bodily
suffering
be
imprint
upon

countenance

that
,
despite
its
fierceness

desperation

few
could
have
regard
him

<EOS>
real
desperation
have
so
much
of
agony
in
its
character

that
no
one
can
witness
it
unmoved

<EOS>
His
garb
be
not
that
in
which
the
reader
first
beheld
him
,
but
a
rich
,
dark
,
simple
suit
of
velvet
,
correspond
more
with
his
real
rank
in
life
than
his
former
peasant
's
attire
;
but
it
be
disorder
by
his
recent
conflict
,
and
stain
with
bloody
testimonial
of
the
fray

his
long
,
sable
curl
,
once
his

now
hang
in
intertangled

<EOS>
even
in
her
terror
,
as
she
dwell
upon
his
noble
feature

Eleanor
could
not
help
admit
that
she
behold
the
undoubted
descendant
,
and
the
live
likeness
of
the
handsome
and
most
distinguished
of
her
house
—
the
profligate
and
criminal
Sir
Reginald

<EOS>
as
her
eye
,
mechanically
follow
this
train
of
thought
,
wander
for
an
instant
to
the
haughty
portraiture
of
Sir
Reginald

which
form
part
of
the
family
picture
,
and
thence
to
those
of
his
unfortunate
lady

she
be
strike
with
the
fancy
that
,
by
some
terrible
fatality
,
the
tragic
horror
of
bygone
day
be
to
be
again
enact
in
their
person

that
they
be
in
some
way
strangely
identify
with
their
unfortunate
progenitor

so
forcibly
be
this
idea
impress
upon
her
feature

Luke

who
have
follow
the
direction
of
her
glance
,
become
instantly
aware
of
it
.
<EOS>
draw
her
nearer
to
the
portrait
of
the
Lady
Eleanor

he
trace
the
resemblance
in
mute
wonder

thence
,
<EOS>
turn
towards
that
of
Sir

he
proudly
exclaim
:

You

then
the
maddening
think
that
she
would
be
shortly

while
the
idea
that
Ranulph

It

even
the

rook
seem
to
participate
in
the
universal
merriment
,
and
return
,
from
their
eyrie
,
a
hoarse
greeting

like
a
lusty
chorus

not

<EOS>
to

he
be
inter

with
all
the
pomp
and
peculiar
solemnity
proper
to
one
of
the

within
the
tomb

It

that

in
order
to
explain
which

again
revert
to
the
night

after

He

"
thou

<EOS>
and
have
possess
himself
of
what
he
come
in

—
namely
,
a
bunch
of
key
and
his
lantern
,
deposit
in
an
out

<EOS>
He
be
once

once

upon
that
awful

whereon
he
have
choose
to
enact

for

his
late
fantastical
character

and
he
gaze
upon

glisten
in
the
moonshine
,
the
green
and
undulating
hillock
,
the
"

<EOS>
He
muse
,
for
a
few
moment

upon
the

apparently
with
deep
interest

<EOS>
He
then
walk
beneath
the
shadow
of
one
of
the
yew
,
chant
an
odd
stanza
or
so
of
one
of
his
wild
stave
,
wrap
the
while

it

in
affectionate
contemplation

as

conclude

Alan
enter
the
churchyard
,
take
care
to
leave
the
door
slightly
ajar
,
in
order
to
facilitate
his
grandson
's
entrance
.
<EOS>
for
an
instant
he
linger
in
the
chancel
.
<EOS>
the
yellow
moonlight
fall
upon
the
monument
of
his
race
;
and
,
direct
by
the
instinct
of
hate
<EOS>
,
Alan
's
eye
rest
upon
the
gilded
entablature
of
his
perfidious
brother

Reginald

and
,
mutter
curse
,
"
not

deep
,
"
he
pass
on
.
<EOS>
have
light
his
lantern
in
no
tranquil
mood
,
he
descend
into
the
vault
,
observe
a
similar
caution
with
respect
to
the
portal
of
the
cemetery
,
which
he
leave
partially
unclosed
,
with
the
key
in
the
lock
.
<EOS>
here
he
resolve
to
abide
Luke
's
come
.
<EOS>
the
reader
know
what
probability
there
be
of
his
expectation
be
realize
.
<EOS>
for
a
while
he
pace
the
tomb
,
wrap
in
gloomy
meditation
,
and
ponder
,
it
may
be
,
upon
the
result
of
Luke
's
expedition
,
and
the
fulfilment
of
his
own
dark
scheme
,
scowl
from
time
to
time
beneath
his
bent
eyebrow
,
count
the
grim
array
of
coffin
,
and
notice
,
with
something
like
satisfaction
,
that
the
shell
which
contain
the
remain
of
his
daughter
have
be
restore
to
its
former
position
.
<EOS>
He
then
bethink
him
of
Father
Checkley
's
midnight
intrusion
upon
his
conference
with
Luke
,
and
their
apprehension
of
a
supernatural
visitation
,
and
his
curiosity
be
stimulate
to
ascertain
by
what
mean
the
priest
have
gain
admission
to
the
spot
unperceived
and
unheard
.
<EOS>
He
resolve
to
sound
the
floor
,
and
see
whether
any
secret
entrance
exist
;
and
hollowly
and
dully
do
the
hard
flagging
return
the
stroke
of
his
heel
as
he
pursue
his
scrutiny
.
<EOS>
at
length
the
metallic
ringing
of
an
iron
plate
,
immediately
behind
the
marble
effigy
of
Sir
Ranulph
,
resolve
the
point
.
<EOS>
there
it
be
that
the
priest
have
find
access
to
the
vault
;
but
Alan
's
disappointment
be
excessive
,
when
he
discover
that
the
plate
be
fasten
on
the
underside
,
and
all
communication
thence
with
the
churchyard
,
or
to
wherever
else
it
may
conduct
him
,
cut
off
:
but
the
present
be
not
the
season
for
further
investigation
,
and
tolerably
pleased
with
the
discovery
he
have
already
make
,
he
return
to
his
silent
march
round
the
sepulchre
.
<EOS>
at
length
a
sound
,
like
the
sudden
shutting
of
the
church
door
,
break
upon
the
profound
stillness
of
the
holy
edifice
.
<EOS>
in
the
hush
that
succeed
,
a
footstep
be
distinctly

thread
the
aisle
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>

"
<EOS>
exclaim
Alan
,
joyfully
;
add
,
an
instant
after
,
in
an
altered
voice

but
he
come
alone

<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
footstep
draw
near

<EOS>
Alan
step
forward
to
greet
,
as
he
suppose

his

start
back
in
astonishment
and
dismay
as
he
encounter
in
his
stead
Lady

<EOS>
Alan
retreat
,
while
the
lady
advance
,
swinge
the
iron
door
after
her
,
which
close
with
a
tremendous
clang
.
<EOS>
approach
the
statue
of
the
first
Sir
Ranulph
,
she
pause
,
and
Alan
then
remark
the
singular
and
terrible
expression
of
her
eye
,
which
appear
to
be
fix
upon
the
statue
,
or
upon
some
invisible
object
near
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
in
her
whole
attitude
and
manner
calculate
to
impress
the
deep
terror
on
the
beholder
.
<EOS>
and
Alan
gaze
upon
her
with
an
awe
which
momently
increase
.
<EOS>
Lady
Rookwood
's
bearing
be
as
proud
and
erect
as
we
have
formerly
describe
it
to
have
be
—
her
brow
be
haughtily
bent
—
her
chisel
lip
as
disdainfully
curl
;
but
the
staring
,
changeless
eye
,
and
the
deep
-
heave
sob
which
occasionally
escape
her
,
betray
how
much
she
be
under
the
influence
of
mortal
terror
.
<EOS>
Alan
watch
her
in
amazement
.
<EOS>
He
know
not
how
the
scene
be
likely
to
terminate
,
nor
what
could
have
induce
her
to
visit
this
ghostly
spot
at
such
an
hour
,
and
alone
;
but
he
resolve
to
abide
the
issue
in
silence
—
profound
as
her
own
.
<EOS>
after
a
time
,
however
,
his
impatience
get
the
well
of
his
fear
and
scruple

and
he
speak

<EOS>
"What

at

She
start
at
the
sound

voice

but
still
keep
her
eye
fix
upon
the
vacancy

<EOS>
"Hast

She

He

"There

"It

<EOS>
at
this
moment
Alan

happen
to
cast
his
eye
upward

he
then
beheld
what

with
new
terror

<EOS>
the
axe

sable

above

some
secret
machinery

it
be
evident
,
exist
between

mysterious
image

but
in
the
first
impulse
of
his
alarm
<EOS>
Alan
abandon
his
hold
of
the
slab

and
it
sink
slowly
downwards

<EOS>
He
utter
a
loud
cry

<EOS>
Lady

hear
this
cry

<EOS>
She
raise
herself
at
the
same
moment
—
the
dagger
be
in
her
hand
—
she
press
it
against
the
lid
,
but
its
downward
force
be
too
great
to
be
withstand
.
<EOS>
the
light
be
within
the
sarcophagus
,
and
Alan
could
discern
her
feature
.
<EOS>
the
expression
be
terrible
.
<EOS>
She
utter
one
shriek
and
the
lid
close
for
ever
.
<EOS>
IllustrationAlan
be
in
total
darkness
.
<EOS>
the
light
have
be
enclose
with
Lady
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
there
be
something
so
horrible
in
her
probable
fate
,
that
even
he
shudder
as
he
think
upon
it
.
<EOS>
exert
all
his
remain
strength
,
he
essay
to
raise
the
lid
,
but
now
it
be
more
firmly
closed
than
ever
.
<EOS>
It
defy
all
his
power
.
<EOS>
once
,
for
an
instant
,
he
fancy
that
it
yield
to
his
strain
sinew
,
but
it
be
only
his
hand
that
slide
upon
the
surface
of
the
marble
.
<EOS>
It
be
fix
—
immovable
.
<EOS>
the
side
and
lid
ring
with
the
stroke
which
the
unfortunate
lady
bestow
upon
them
with
the
dagger
's
point
;
but
those
sound
be
not
long
hear
.
<EOS>
presently
all
be
still
;
the
marble
cease
to
vibrate
with
her
blow
.
<EOS>
Alan
strike
the
lid
with
his
knuckle
,
but
no
response
be
return
.
<EOS>
all
be
silent
.
<EOS>
He
now
turn
his
attention
to
his
own
situation
,
which
have
become
sufficiently
alarming
.
<EOS>
an
hour
must
have
elapse
,
yet
Luke
have
not
arrive
.
<EOS>
the
door
of
the
vault
be
close
—
the
key
be
in
the
lock
,
and
on
the
outside
.
<EOS>
He
be
himself
a
prisoner
within
the
tomb
.
<EOS>
what
if
Luke
should
not
return
?
<EOS>
what
if
he
be
slay
,
as
it
may
chance
,
in
the
enterprise
?
<EOS>
that
thought
flash
across
his
brain
like
an
electric
shock
.
<EOS>
none
know
of
his
retreat
but
his
grandson
.
<EOS>
He
may
perish
of
famine
within
this
desolate
vault
.
<EOS>
He
check
this
notion
as
soon
as
it
be
form
—
it
be
too
dreadful
to
be
indulge
in
.
<EOS>
a
thousand
circumstance
may
conspire
to
detain
Luke
.
<EOS>
He
be
sure
to
come
.
<EOS>
yet
the
solitude
—
the
darkness
be
awful
,
almost
intolerable
.
<EOS>
the
dying
and
the
dead
be
around
him
.
<EOS>
He
dare
not
stir
.
<EOS>
another
hour
—
an
age
it
seem
to
him
—
have
pass
.
<EOS>
still
Luke
come
not
.
<EOS>
horrible
foreboding
cross
him
;
but
he
would
not
surrender
himself
to
them
.
<EOS>
He
rise
,
and
crawl
in
the
direction
,
as
he
suppose
,
of
the
door
—
fearful
,
even
of
the
stealthy
sound
of
his
own
footstep
.
<EOS>
He
reach
it
,
and
his
heart
once
more
throbbed
with
hope
.
<EOS>
He
bend
his
ear
to
the
key
;
he
draw
in
his
breath
;
he
listen
for
some
sound
,
but
nothing
be
to
be
hear
.
<EOS>
a
groan
would
have
be
almost
music
in
his
ear
.
<EOS>
another
hour
be
go
!
<EOS>
He
be
now
a
prey
to
the
most
frightful
apprehension
,
agitate
in
turn
by
the
wildest
emotion
of
rage
and
terror
.
<EOS>
He
at
one
moment
imagine
that
Luke
have
abandon
him
,
and
heap
curse
upon
his
head
;
at
the
next
,
convince
that
he
have
fall
,
he
bewail
with
equal
bitterness
his
grandson
's
fate
and
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
pace
the
tomb
like
one
distract
;
he
stamp
upon
the
iron
plate
;
he
smite
with
his
hand
upon
the
door
;
he
shout
,
and
the
vault
hollowly
echo
his
lamentation
.
<EOS>
but
Time
's
sand
run
on
,
and
Luke
arrive
not
.
<EOS>
Alan
now
abandon
himself
wholly
to
despair
.
<EOS>
He
could
no
longer
anticipate
his
grandson
's
coming
,
no
longer
hope
for
deliverance
.
<EOS>
His
fate
be
seal
.
<EOS>
death
await
him
.
<EOS>
He
must
anticipate
his
slow
but
inevitable
stroke
,
endure
all
the
grind
horror
of
starvation
.
<EOS>
the
contemplation
of
such
an
end
be
madness
,
but
he
be
force
to
contemplate
it
now
;
and
so
appalling
<EOS>
do
it
appear
to
his
imagination
,
that
he
half
resolve
to
dash
out
his
brain
against
the
wall
of
the
sepulchre
,
and
put
an
end
at
once
to
his
torture
;
and
nothing
,
except
a
doubt
whether
he
may
not
,
by
imperfectly
accomplish
his
purpose
,
increase
his
own
suffering
,
prevent
him
from
put
this
dreadful
idea
into
execution
.
<EOS>
His
dagger
be
go
,
and
he
have
no
other
weapon
.
<EOS>
terror
of
a
new
kind
now
assail
him
.
<EOS>
the
dead
,
he
fancy
,
be
burst
from
their
coffin
,
and
he
people
the
darkness
with
grisly
phantom
.
<EOS>
They
be
around
about
him
on
each
side
,
whirl
and
rustle
,
gibbering
,
groaning
,
shriek
,
laugh
,
and
lamenting
.
<EOS>
He
be
stunned
,
stifle
.
<EOS>
the
air
seem
to
grow
suffocate
,
pestilential
;
the
wild
laughter
be
redouble
;
the
horrible
troop
assail
him
;
they
drag
him
along
the
tomb
,
and
amid
their
howl
he
fall
,
and
become
insensible
.
<EOS>
when
he
return
to
himself
,
it
be
some
time
before
he
could
collect
his
scatter
faculty
;
and
when
the
agonizing
consciousness
of
his
terrible
situation
force
itself
upon
his
mind
,
he
have
nigh
relapse
into
oblivion
.
<EOS>
He
arise
.
<EOS>
He
rush
towards
the
door
;
he
knock
against
it
with
his
knuckle
till
the
blood
stream
from
them
;
he
scratch
against
it
with
his
nail
till
they
be
tear
off
by
the
root
.
<EOS>
with
insane
fury
he
hurl
himself
against
the
iron
frame
;
it
be
in
vain
.
<EOS>
again
he
have
recourse
to
the
trap
-
door
.
<EOS>
He
search
for
it
;
he
find
it
.
<EOS>
He
lay
himself
upon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
interval
of
space
in
which
he
could
insert
a
finger
's
point
.
<EOS>
He
beat
it
with
his
clenched
hand
;
he
tear
it
with
his
tooth
;
he
jump
upon
it
;
he
smite
it
with
his
heel
.
<EOS>
the
iron
return
a
sullen
sound
.
<EOS>
He
again
essay
the
lid
of
the
sarcophagus
.
<EOS>
despair
nerve
his
strength
.
<EOS>
He
raise
the
slab
a
few
inch
.
<EOS>
He
shout
,
scream
,
but
no
answer
be
return
;
and
again
the
lid
fall
.
<EOS>
"She
be
dead
!
"
<EOS>
cry
Alan
.
<EOS>
"
why
have
I
not
share
her
fate
?
<EOS>
but
mine
be
to
come
.
<EOS>
and
such
a
death!—oh
,
oh
!
"
<EOS>
and
,
frenzy
at
the
thought
,
he
again
hurry
to
the
door
,
and
renew
his
fruitless
attempt
to
escape
,
till
nature
give
way
,
and
he
sink
upon
the
floor
,
groaning
and
exhausted
.
<EOS>
physical
suffering
now
begin
to
take
the
place
of
his
mental
torture
.
<EOS>
parch
and
consume
with
a
fierce
internal
fever
,
he
be
torment
by
unappeasable
thirst
—
of
all
human
ill
the
most
unendurable
.
<EOS>
His
tongue
be
dry
and
dusty
,
his
throat
inflame
;
his
lip
have
lose
all
moisture
.
<EOS>
He
lick
the
humid
floor
;
he
seek
to
imbibe
the
nitrous
drop
from
the
wall
;
but
,
instead
of
allay
his
thirst
,
they
increase
it
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
give
the
world
,
have
he
possess
it
,
for
a
draught
of
cold
spring
-
water
.
<EOS>
oh
,
to
have
die
with
his
lip
upon
some
bubble
fountain
's
marge
!
<EOS>
but
to
perish
thus——!Nor
be
the
pang
of
hunger
want
.
<EOS>
He
have
to
endure
all
the
horror
of
famine
,
as
well
as
the
agony
of
quenchless
thirst
.
<EOS>
in
this
dreadful
state
three
day
and
night
pass
over
Alan
's
fated
head
.
<EOS>
nor
night
nor
day
have
he
.
<EOS>
Time
,
with
him
,
be
only
measure
by
its
duration
,
and
that
seem
interminable
.
<EOS>
each
hour
add
to
his
suffering
,
and
bring
with
it
no
relief
.
<EOS>
during
this
period
of
prolong
misery
reason
often
totter
on
her
throne
.
<EOS>
sometimes
he
be
under
the
influence
of
the
wildest
passion
.
<EOS>
He
drag
coffin
from
their
recess
,
hurl
them
upon
the
ground
,
strive
to
break
them
open
and
drag
forth
their
loathsome
content
.
<EOS>
upon
other
occasion
he
would
weep
bitterly
and
wildly
;
and
once
—
only
once
—
do
he
attempt
to
pray
;
but
he
start
from
his
knee
with
an
echo
of
infernal
laughter
,
as
he
deem
,
ring
in
his
ear
.
<EOS>
then
,
again
,
would
he
call
down
imprecation
upon
himself
and
his
whole
line
,
trample
upon
the
pile
of
coffin
he
have
rear
;
and
lastly
,
more
subdued
,
would
creep
to
the
board
that
contain
the
body
of
his
child
,
kiss
them
with
a
frantic
outbreak
of
affection
.
<EOS>
at
length
he
become
sensible
of
his
approach
dissolution
.
<EOS>
to
him
the
thought
of
death
may
well
be
terrible
,
but
he
quail
not
before
it
,
or
rather
seem
,
in
his
late
moment
,
to
resume
all
his
wonted
firmness
of
character
.
<EOS>
gather
together
his
remain
strength
,
he
drag
himself
towards
the
niche
wherein
his
brother
,
Sir
Reginald
Rookwood
,
be
deposit
,
and
place
his
hand
upon
the
coffin
,
solemnly
exclaim
,
"
My
curse
—
my
die
curse
—
be
upon
thee
evermore!"falle
with
his
face
upon
the
coffin
,
Alan
instantly
expire
.
<EOS>
in
this
attitude
his
remain
be
discover
.
<EOS>
L'ENVOYOur
tale
be
tell
.
<EOS>
yet
,
perhaps
,
we
may
be
allow
to
add
a
few
word
respect
two
of
the
subordinate
character
of
our
drama
—
melodrama
<EOS>
we
ought
to
say
—
namely
Jerry
Juniper
and
the
knight
of
Malta
.
<EOS>
what
become
of
the
Caper
Merchant
's
son
after
his
flight
from
Kilburn
Wells
we
have
never
be
able
distinctly
to
ascertain
.
<EOS>
juniper
,
however
,
would
seem
to
be
a
sort
of
wander
Jew
,
for
certain
it
be
,
that
somebody
very
like
him
be
extant
still
,
and
to
be
meet
with
at
Jerry
's
old
haunt
;
indeed
,
we
have
no
doubt
of
encounter
him
at
the
ensue
meeting
of
Ascot
and
Hampton
.
<EOS>
as
regard
the
knight
of
Malta
—
Knight
of
Roads—"Rhodes"—he
should
have
be
—
we
be
sorry
to
state
that
the
career
of
the
Ruffler
terminate
in
a
madhouse
,
and
thus
the
poor
knight
become
in
reality
a
Hospitaller
!
<EOS>
accord
to
the
custom
observe
in
those
establishment
,
the
knight
be
deprive
of
his
luxuriant
lock
,
and
the
loss
of
his
beard
render
his
case
incurable
;
but
,
in
the
mean
time
,
the
barber
of
the
place
make
his
fortune
by
retail
the
material
of
all
the
black
wig
he
could
collect
to
the
impostor
's
dupe
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
late
piece
of
intelligence
that
have
reach
us
of
the
Arch
-
hoaxer
of
Canterbury!Turpin
—
why
disguise
it?—wa
hang
at
York
in
1739
.
<EOS>
His
firmness
desert
him
not
at
the
last
.
<EOS>
when
he
mount
the
fatal
tree
his
left
leg
tremble
;
he
stamp
it
impatiently
down
,
and
,
after
a
brief
chat
with
the
hangman
,
throw
himself
suddenly
and
resolutely
from
the
ladder
.
<EOS>
His
suffering
would
appear
to
have
be
slight
:
<EOS>
as
he
himself
sing
,
He
die
,
not
as
other
man
,
by
degree
,
but
at
once
,
without
wince
,

quite
at
his

<EOS>
this
would
have
be
sufficient
to
excite
attention

have
no

add

<EOS>
His
costume
and
countenance
denote
foreign
extraction
,
while
his
language
and
conversation
show
that
he
be
well
acquaint
with
almost
every
part
of
this
kingdom

<EOS>
He
be
say
to
live
with
singular
frugality
,
notwithstanding
abundant
sample
of
wealth
,
and
profession
of
an
almost
unlimited
command

He
appear
to
study
retirement

although
subsequent

prove

society
of

beneath

the
element
in
which
he
most
freely

<EOS>
He
often
deck
his
person
with
a
fine
suit
of
italian
clothing
,
and
sometimes
with
the
more
gay
and
impose
costume
of
the
eastern
nation
;
yet
these
foreign
habit
be
for
month
scarcely
visible
beyond
the
limit
of
the
inn
of
his
abode
,
and
the
chapel
not
far
from
it
,
in
which
he
be
accustomed
to
offer
his
Sabbath
devotion
.
<EOS>
this
place
be
the
first
to
which
he
make
a
public
and
frequent
resort
;
and
though
he
do
not
always
attempt
to
advance
towards
the
uppermost
seat
in
the
synagogue
,
he
attract
attention
from
the
mere
singularity
of
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
"Such

the
notion

originate
beyond
all

fertile
brain

It

it

at

these

"All

convince
them

be
even

revelling

it

<EOS>

none

plunge

<EOS>
He
tear

We
have
hear
of
a
certain
gentleman
tobyman
,
we
forget
his
name
,
take
the
horse
from
his
curricle
for
a
similar
purpose
,

we
own

think
King
be
the
simple
plan
,
and
quite
practicable
still
.

descend

with

we

since
the
early
edition
of
this
romance
be
publish
,
we
regret
to
state
—
for
to
us
,
at
least
,
it
be
matter
of
regret
,
though
probably
not
to
the
traveller
along
the
Edgeware
Road
—
that
this
gentle
ascent
have
be
cut
through
,
and
the
fair
prospect
from
its
brow
utterly
destroyed.[110

<EOS>
this
,
we
regret
to
say
,
be
not
the
case
.

the
memory
of
bold
Will
Davies
,
the
"
golden
farmer"—so
name
from
the
circumstance
of
his
always
pay
his
rent
in
gold,—is
fast
decline
upon
his
peculiar
domain
,
Bagshot

<EOS>
the
inn
,
which
once
bear
his
name
,
still
remain
to
point
out
to
the
traveller
the
danger
his
forefather
have
to
encounter
in
cross
this
extensive
heath
.
<EOS>
just
beyond
this
house
the
common
spread
out
for
mile
on
all
aide
in
a
most
gallop

and
the
passenger

as
he
gaze
from
the
box
of
some
fly
coach

as
we
have
do
,
upon
the
gorse

cover

,
may
,
without
much
stretch

,
imagine
he
behold
Will
Davies
career
like
the
wind
over
its
wild
and
undulate
expanse
.
<EOS>
We
be
sorry
to
add
that
the
"
Golden
Farmer
"
have
alter
its
designation
to
the
"
Jolly
Farmer
.
<EOS>
"
this
should
be
amend
;
and
when
next
we
pass
that
way
,
we
hope
to
see
the
original
sign
restore
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
afford
to
lose
our
golden
farmer
.
