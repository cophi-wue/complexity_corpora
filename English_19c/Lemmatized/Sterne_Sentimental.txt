Strange

I

give
up
the

I

the

by

I
have
get

my

upon

<EOS>
I
have
scarce

a
poor
monk
of
the
order

come
into

to
beg
something
for

for
there
be
no

depend
upon
the

'
twould
oft
be
no
discredit
to

to
suppose
it

so

<EOS>
I
be
sure
at

for
myself
,
that
in
many
a
case
I
should
be
more
highly
satisfied
,
to
have
it
say
by

,
"
I
have
have
an
affair
with
the
moon

in
which
there
be
neither
sin

"
than
have
it
pass
altogether
as
my

act

wherein
there
be
so
much
of
both

<EOS>
but
,
be
this
as
it
may

the
moment
I
cast
my
eye
upon
him
,
I
be
predetermine
not
to
give
him
a
single
sous
;
and
,
accordingly
,
I
put
my
purse
into
my
pocket
 
<EOS>
button
it
 
<EOS>
set
myself
a
little
more
upon
my
centre

and
advance
up
gravely
to
him
;
there
be
something
,
I
fear
,
forbid
in
my
look
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
his
figure
this
moment
before
my
eye
,
and
think
there
be
that
in
it
which
deserve
better
.
  
<EOS>
the
monk
,
as
I
judge
by
the
break
in
his
tonsure
,
a
few
scatter
white
hair
upon
his
temple
,
be
all
that
remain
of
it
,
may
be
about
seventy
;
 
but
from
his
eye
,
and
that
sort
of
fire
which
be
in
them
,
which
seem
more
temper'd
by
courtesy
than
year
,
could
be
no
more
than
sixty
:
  
<EOS>
T
ruth
may
lie
between
 
<EOS>
He
be
certainly
sixty
-
five
;
and
the
general
air
of
his
countenance
,
notwithstanding
something
seem'd
to
have
be
plant
-
wrinkle
in
it
before
their
time
,
agree
to
the
account

<EOS>
It
be
one
of
those
head
which
Guido

often
paint

mild
,
pale
 
penetrating
,
free
from
all
commonplace
idea
of
fat
contented
ignorance
look
downwards
upon
the
earth

it
<EOS>
look'd
forwards
;
but
look'd
as
if
it
look'd
<EOS>
at
something
beyond
this
world

<EOS>
how
one
of
his
order
come
by
it
,
heaven
above

who
let
it
fall
upon
a
monk
's
shoulder
good
know

but
it
would
have
suit
a
Bramin
,
and
have
I
meet
it
upon
the
plain
of
Indostan
<EOS>
,
I
have
reverence
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
rest
of
his
outline
may
be
give
in

stroke

one
may
put
it
into
the
hand
of
any
one
to
design

for
'
twas
neither
elegant
nor
otherwise
,
but
as
character
and
expression
make
it
so
<EOS>
:
it
be
a
thin
,
spare
form
,
something
above
the
common
size
,
if
it
lose
not
the
distinction
by
a
bend
forward
in
the
figure
,
 
but
it
be
the
attitude
of
Intreaty

and
,
<EOS>
as
it
now
stand
presented
to
my
imagination

it
gain
more

<EOS>
when
he
have
enter
the
room
three
pace
,
he
stand
still
;
and
lay
his
left
hand
upon
his
breast
(
a
slender
white
staff
with
which
he
journey'd
be
in
his
right
)
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
get
close
up
to
him
,
he
introduce
himself
with
the
little
story
of
the
want
of
his
convent
,
and
the
poverty
of
his
order
;
 
and
do
it
with
so
simple
a
grace
,
 
and
such
an
air
of
deprecation
be
there
in
the
whole
cast
of
his
look
and
figure
,
 
<EOS>
I
be
bewitch'd
not
to
have
be
strike
with
it
.
     
<EOS>
a
well
reason
be

I
have
predetermine
not

give
him
a

<EOS>

<EOS>
'
Tis
very
true
<EOS>
,
say
I
,
reply
to
a
cast
upwards
with
his
eye
,
with
which
he
have
conclude
his
address
;
 
'
tis
very
true
,
 
and
heaven
be
their
resource
who
have
no
other
<EOS>
but
the
charity
of

the
stock
of
which
,
I
fear

be
no
way
sufficient
for
the
many
great
claim
which
be
hourly
make
upon
it

<EOS>
as
I
pronounce
the
word
great
claim
,
he
give
a
slight
glance
with
his
eye
downwards
upon
the
sleeve
of
his
tunic
:
  
<EOS>
I
 
feel
the
full
force
of
the
appeal
 
<EOS>
I
acknowledge
it
,
say
I
:
  
<EOS>
a
 
coarse
habit
,
and
that
but
once
in
three
year
with
meagre
diet
,
 
be
no
great
matter
;
and
the
true
point
of
pity
be
,
as
they
can
be
earn'd
in
the
world
with
so
little
industry
,
that
your
order
should
wish
to
procure
them
by
press
upon
a
fund
which
be
the
property
of
the
lame
,
the
blind
,
the
aged
and
the
infirm
;
 
the
captive
who
lie
down
count
over
and
over
again
the
day
of
his
affliction
,
languish
also
for
his
share
of
it
;
and
have
you
be
of
the
ORDER
of
MERCY
,
instead
of
the
order
of
St.
Francis
,
poor
as
I
be

<EOS>
continue
I

point
at
my
portmanteau

full
cheerfully
should

open'd

the

make
me
a
bow

<EOS>
but
of
all
other
,
resume
I
,
the
unfortunate
of
our
own
country
,
surely
,
have
the
first
right
;
and
I
have
leave
thousand
in
distress
upon
our
own
shore
.
 
<EOS>
the
monk
give
a
cordial
wave
with
his
head
,
 
as
much
as
to
say
,
no
doubt
there
be
misery
enough
in
every
corner
of
the
world
,
as
well
as
within
our
convent
 
<EOS>
but
we
distinguish
,
say
I
,
lay
my
hand
upon
the
sleeve
of
his
tunic
,
in
return
for
his
appeal
 
<EOS>
we
distinguish
,
my
good
father

betwixt
those

no

to
get
through
it
in

for
the
LOVE

<EOS>
the
poor
Franciscan
make
no
reply
:
 
a
hectic
of
a
moment
pass'd
across
his
cheek
,
but
could
not
tarry
 
<EOS>
nature
seem
to
have
do
with

resentment

none

Psha

say
I
,
with
an
air
of
carelessness
,
three
several
time
 
<EOS>
but
it

not
do

<EOS>
every
ungracious
syllable
I
have
utter'd
crowd
back
into
my
imagination

<EOS>
I
reflect
,
I
have
no
right
over
the
poor
Franciscan
,
but
to
deny
him
;
and
that
the
punishment
of
that
be
enough
to
the
disappointed
,
without
the
addition
of
unkind
language

<EOS>
I
consider'd
<EOS>
his
gray
hair
 
his
courteous
figure
seem'd
<EOS>
to
re

enter
and
gently
ask
me
what
injury
he
have
do
me

<EOS>
and
why
I
could
use
him
thus

<EOS>
I
would

I

in
conference
with

arrive
at

PREFACE
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
DESOBLIGEANT
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
have
be
observe
by
many
a
peripatetic
philosopher
,
that
nature
have
set
up
by
her
own
unquestionable
authority
certain
boundary
and
fence
to
circumscribe
the
discontent
of
man
;
she
have
effect
her
purpose
in
the
quiet
and
easy
manner
by
lay
him
under
almost
insuperable
obligation
to
work
out
his
ease
,
and
to
sustain
his
suffering
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
there
only
that
she
have
provide
him
with
the
most
suitable
object
to
partake
of
his
happiness
,
and
bear
a
part
of
that
burden
which
in
all
country
and
age
have
ever
be
too
heavy
for
one
pair
of
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
true
,
we
be
endue
with
an
imperfect
power
of
spread
our
happiness
sometimes
beyond
HER
limit
,
but
'
tis
so
order
,
that
,
from
the
want
of
language
,
connection
,
and
dependency
,
and
from
the
difference
in
education
,
custom
,
and
habit
,
we
lie
under
so
many
impediment
in
communicate
our
sensation
out
of
our
own
sphere
,
as
often
amount
to
a
total
impossibility
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
always
follow
from
hence
,
that
the
balance
of
sentimental
commerce

the
expatriate
adventurer

<EOS>
he
must
buy
what
he
have
little
occasion
for

at
their
own
price

his
conversation
will

of
more
equitable
broker

for
such
conversation
as
he
can
find
,
it
require
no
great
spirit
of
divination
to
guess
at
his
party
     
<EOS>
this
bring
me
to
my
point
;
and
naturally
lead
me
(
if
the
see
-
saw
of
this
desobligeant
will
but
let
me
get
on
)
into
the
efficient
as
well
as
final
cause
of
travel
     
<EOS>
Your
idle
people
that
leave
their
native
country
,
and
go
abroad
for
some
reason
or
reason
which
may
be
derive
from
one
of
these
general
cause
:
    
Infirmity
of
body
,
imbecility
of
mind
,
or
inevitable
necessity
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
two
include
all
those
who
travel
by
land
or
by
water
,
labour
with
pride
,
curiosity
,
vanity
,
or
spleen
,
subdivide
and
combine
ad
infinitum
.
  
<EOS>
the
third
class
include
the
whole
army
of
peregrine
martyr
;
more
especially
those
traveller
who
set
out
upon
their
travel
with
the
benefit
of
the
clergy
,
either
as
delinquent
travel
under
the
direction
of
governor
recommend
by
the
magistrate
;
 
or
young
gentleman
transport
by
the
cruelty
of
parent
and
guardian
,
and
travel
under
the
direction
of
governor
recommend
by
Oxford
,
Aberdeen
,
and
Glasgow
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
fourth
class
,
but
their
number
be
so
small
that
they
would
not
deserve
a
distinction
,
be
it
not
necessary
in
a
work
of
this
nature
to
observe
the
great
precision
and
nicety
,
to
avoid
a
confusion
of
character
.
 
<EOS>
and
these
man
I
speak
of
,
be
such
as
cross
the
sea
and
sojourn
in
a
land
of
stranger
,
with
a
view
of
save
money
for
various
reason
and
upon
various
pretence
:
 
<EOS>
but
as
they
may
also
save
themselves
and
other
a
great
deal
of
unnecessary
trouble
by
save
their
money
at
home
,
 
and
as
their
reason
for
travel
be
the
least
complex
of
any
other
specie
of
emigrant
,
I
shall
distinguish
these
gentleman
by
the
name
of
  
Simple
Travellers
.
  
<EOS>
thus
the
whole
circle
of
traveller
may
be
reduce
to
the
follow
HEADS
:
    
Idle
Travellers
,
Inquisitive
Travellers
,
lie
Travellers
,
Proud
Travellers
,
Vain
Travellers
,
Splenetic
Travellers
.
  
<EOS>
then
follow
:
  
the
Travellers
of
Necessity
,
the
Delinquent
and
Felonious
Traveller
,
the
Unfortunate
and
Innocent
Traveller
,
the
Simple
traveller
,
  
and
last
of
all
(
if
you
please
)
<EOS>
the
Sentimental
traveller
,
(
mean
thereby
myself
)
who
have
travell'd
,
and
of
which
I
be
now
sit
down
to
give
an
account
,
 
as
much
out
of
NECESSITY
,
and
the
besoin
de
Voyager
,
as
any
one
in
the
class
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
well
aware
,
at
the
same
time
,
as
both
my
travel
and
observation
will
be
altogether
of
a
different
cast
from
any
of
my
forerunner
,
that
I
may
have
insist
upon
a
whole
nitch
entirely
to
myself
;
 
but
I
should
break
in
upon
the
confine
of
the
VAIN
Traveller
,
in
wish
to
draw
attention
towards
me
,
till
I
have
some
well
ground
for
it
than
the
mere
NOVELTY
of
my
VEHICLE
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
sufficient
for
my
reader
,
if
he
have
be
a
traveller
himself
,
that
with
study
and
reflection
hereupon
he
may
be
able
to
determine
his
own
place
and
rank
in
the
catalogue
;
 
it
will
be
one
step
towards
know
himself
;
as
it
be
great
odd
<EOS>
but
he
retain
some
tincture
and
resemblance
,
of
what
he
imbibe
or
carry
out
,
to
the
present
hour
.
  
<EOS>
the
man
who
first
transplant
the
grape
of
Burgundy
to
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
(
observe
he
be
a
Dutchman
)
never
dreamt
of
drink
the
same
wine
at
the
Cape
,
that
the
same
grape
produce
upon
the
french
mountain
,
 
he
be
too
phlegmatic
for
that
 
<EOS>
but
undoubtedly
he
expect
to
drink
some
sort
of
vinous
liquor
;
but
whether
good
or
bad
,
or
indifferent
,
 
he
know
enough
of
this
world
to
know
,
that
it
do
not
depend
upon
his
choice
,
but
that
what
be
generally
call
CHOICE
,
be
to
decide
his
success
:
 
<EOS>
however
,
he
hope
for
the
good
;
and
in
these
hope
,
by
an
intemperate
confidence
in
the
fortitude
of
his
head
,
and
the
depth
of
his
discretion
,
Mynheer
may
possibly
oversee
both
in
his
new
vineyard
;
and
by
discover
his
nakedness
,
become
a
laugh
stock
to
his
people
.
  
<EOS>
even
so
it
fare
with
the
Poor
Traveller
,
sailing
and
post
through
the
politer
kingdom
of
the
globe
,
in
pursuit
of
knowledge
and
improvement
.
  
<EOS>
knowledge
and
improvement
be
to
be
get
by
sailing
and
post
for
that
purpose
;
but
whether
useful
knowledge
and
real
improvement
be
all
a
lottery
;
 
and
even
where
the
adventurer
be
successful
,
the
acquire
stock
must
be
use
with
caution
and
sobriety
,
to
turn
to
any
profit
:
  
b
ut
,
as
the
chance
run
prodigiously
the
other
way
,
both
as
to
the
acquisition
and
application
,
I
be
of
opinion
,
that
a
man
would
act
as
wisely
,
if
he
could
prevail
upon
himself
to
live
contented
without
foreign
knowledge
or
foreign
improvement
,
especially
if
he
live
in
a
country
that
have
no
absolute
want
of
either
;
 
and
indeed
,
much
grief
of
heart
have
it
oft
and
many
a
time
cost
me
,
when
I
have
observe
how
many
a
foul
step
<EOS>
the
Inquisitive
Traveller
have
measure
to
see
sight
and
look
into
discovery
;
all
which
,
as
Sancho
Panza
say
to
Don
Quixote
,
they
may
have
see
dry
-
shod
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
an
age
so
full
of
light
,
that
there
be
scarce
a
country
or
corner
in
Europe
whose
beam
be
not
cross
and
interchange
with
other
.
 
<EOS>
knowledge
in
most
of
its
branch
,
and
in
most
affair
,
be
like
music
in
an
italian
street
,
whereof
those
may
partake
who
pay
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
nation
under
heaven
 
and
<EOS>
God
be
my
record
(
before
whose
tribunal
I
must
one
day
come
and
give
an
account
of
this
work
)
 
<EOS>
that
I
do
not
speak
it
vauntingly
,
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
nation
under
heaven
abound
with
more
variety
of
learning
,
 
where
the
science
may
be
more
fitly
woo'd
,
or
more
surely
win
,
than
here
,
 
where
art
be
encourage
,
and
will
so
soon
rise
high
,
 
where
Nature
(
take
her
altogether
)
<EOS>
have
so
little
to
answer
for
,
 
and
,
to
close
all
,
where
there
be
more
wit
and
variety
of
character
to
feed
the
mind
with
:
  
W
here
then
,
my
dear
countryman
,
be
you
go
?
     
<EOS>
We
be
only
look
at
this
chaise
,
say
they
.
 
<EOS>
Your
most
obedient
servant
,
say
I
,
skip
out
of
it
,
and
pull
off
my
hat
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
wonder
,
say
one
of
them
,
who
,
I
find
be
an
Inquisitive
Traveller
,
 
what
could
occasion
its
motion
.
 
<EOS>
'
Twas
the
agitation
,
say
I
,
coolly
,
of
write
a
preface
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
hear
,
say
the
other
,
who
be
a
Simple
traveller
,
of
a
preface
write
in
a
desobligeant
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
well
,
say
I
,
in
a
vis
-
a
-
vis
.
     
<EOS>
as
an
Englishman
do
not
travel
to
see
Englishmen
,
I
retire
to
my
room
.
  
<EOS>
CALAIS
.
  
<EOS>
I
perceive
that
something
darken'd
<EOS>
the
passage
more
than
myself
,
as
I
stepp'd
along
it
to
my
room
;
it
be
effectually
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
,
the
master
of
the
hotel
,
who
have
just
return
from
vesper
,
and
with
his
hat
under
his
arm
,
be
most
complaisantly
follow
me
,
to
put
me
in
mind
of
my
want
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
write
myself
pretty
well
out
of
conceit
with
the
desobligeant
,
and
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
speak
of
it
,
with
a
shrug
,
as
if
it
would
<EOS>
no
way
suit
me
,
it
immediately
strike
my
fancy
that
it
belong'd
to
some
Innocent
Traveller
,
who
,
on
his
return
home
,
have
leave
it
to
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
's
honour
to
make
the
most
of
.
 
<EOS>
four
month
have
elapse
since
it
have
finish
its
career
of
Europe
in
the
corner
of
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
's
coach
-
yard
;
and
have
sally
out
from
thence
but
a
vampt
-
up
business
at
the
first
,
though
it
have
be
twice
take
to
piece
on
Mount
Sennis
,
it
have
not
profit
much
by
its
adventure
,
 
but
by
none
so
little
as
the
standing
so
many
month
unpitie
in
the
corner
of
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
's
coach
-
yard
.
 
<EOS>
much
indeed
be
not
to
be
say
for
it
,
 
but
something
may
;
 
and
when
a
few
word
will
rescue
misery
out
of
her
distress
,
I
hate
the
man
who
can
be
a
churl
of
them
.
     
<EOS>
now
be
I
the
master
of
this
hotel
,
say
I
,
lay
the
point
of
my
fore
-
finger
on
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
's
breast
,
I
would
inevitably
make
a
point
of
get
rid
of
this
unfortunate
desobligeant
;
 
it
stand
swinging
reproach
at
you
every
time
you
pass
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mon
Dieu
!
say
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
,
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
interest
 
except
the
interest
,
say
I
,
which
man
of
a
certain
turn
of
mind
take
,
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
,
in
their
own
sensation
,
 
<EOS>
I
be
persuade
,
to
a
man
who
feel
for
other
as
well
as
for
himself
,
every
rainy
night
,
disguise
it
as
you
will
,
<EOS>
must
cast
a
damp
upon
your
spirit
:
  
<EOS>
y
ou
suffer
,
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
,
as
much
as
the
machine
     
<EOS>
I
have
always
observe
,
when
there
be
as
much
sour
as
sweet
in
a
compliment
,
that
an
Englishman
be
eternally
at
a
loss
within
himself
,
whether
to
take
it
,
or
let
it
alone
:
 
<EOS>
a
Frenchman
never
be
:
 
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
make
me
a
bow
.
  
<EOS>
c'est
bien
vrai
,
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
this
case
I
should
only
exchange
one
disquietude
for
another
,
and
with
loss
:
 
figure
to
yourself
,
my
dear
Sir
,
<EOS>
that
in
give
you
a
chaise
which
would
fall
to
piece
before
you
have
get
half
-
way
to
Paris
,
 
figure
to
yourself
how
much
I
should
suffer
,
in
give
an
ill
impression
of
myself
to
a
man
of
honour
,
and
lie
at
the
mercy
,
as
I
must
do
,
d'un
homme
d'esprit
.
  
<EOS>
the
dose
be
make
up
exactly
after
my
own
prescription
;
so
I
could
not
help
taste
it
,
 
and
,
return
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
his
bow
,
without
more
casuistry
we
walk'd
<EOS>
together
towards
his
Remise
,
to
take
a
view
of
his
magazine
of
chaise
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
CALAIS
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
needs
be
a
hostile
kind
of
a
world
,
when
the
buyer
(
if
it
be
but
of
a
sorry
post
-
chaise
)
can
not
go
forth
with
the
seller
thereof
into
the
street
to
terminate
the
difference
betwixt
them
,
but
he
instantly
fall
into
the
same
frame
of
mind
,
and
view
his
conventionist
with
the
same
sort
of
eye
,
as
if
he
be
go
along
with
him
to
Hyde
-
park
corner
to
fight
a
duel
.
 
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
be
but
a
poor
swordsman
,
and
no
way
a
match
for
Monsieur
Dessein
,
I
feel
the
rotation
of
all
the
movement
within
me
,
to
which
the
situation
be
incident
;
 
I
look
at
Monsieur
Dessein
through
and
through
 
eye
him
as
he
walk'd
<EOS>
along
in
profile
,
 
then
,
en
face
;
 
think
like
a
Jew
,
 
then
a
Turk
,
 
dislike
his
wig
,
  
curse
him
by
my
god
,
 
wish
him
at
the
devil
.
        
<EOS>
and
be
all
this
to
be
light
up
in
the
heart
for
a
beggarly
account
of
three
or
four
louis
d'or
,
which
be
the
most
I
can
be
overreach
in
?
 
<EOS>
Base
passion
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
turn
myself
about
,
as
a
man
naturally
do
upon
a
sudden
reverse
of
sentiment
,
 
base
,
ungentle
passion
!
<EOS>
thy
hand
be
against
every
man
,
and
every
man
's
hand
against
thee
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
!
<EOS>
say
she
,
raise
her
hand
up
to
her
forehead
,
for
I
have
turn
full
in
front
upon
the
lady
whom
I
have
see
in
conference
with
the
monk
:
  
<EOS>
s
he
have
follow
us
unperceived
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
offer
her
my
own
;
  
she
have
a
black
pair
of
silk
glove
,
open
only
at
the
thumb
and
two
fore
-
finger
,
so
accept
it
without
reserve
,
 
<EOS>
and
I
lead
her
up
to
the
door
of
the
Remise
.
  
<EOS>
Monsieur
Dessein
have
diable
the
key
above
fifty
time
before
he
have
find
out
he
have
come
with
a
wrong
one
in
his
hand
:
 
we
be
as
impatient
as
himself
to
have
it
open
;
and
so
attentive
to
the
obstacle
that
I
continue
hold
her
hand
almost
without
know
it
:
 
so
that
Monsieur
Dessein
leave
us
together
with
her
hand
in
mine
,
and
with
our
face
turn
towards
the
door
of
the
Remise
,
and
say
he
would
be
back
in
five
minute
.
  
<EOS>
now
a
colloquy
of
five
minute
,
in
such
a
situation
,
be
worth
one
of
as
many
age
,
with
your
face
turn
towards
the
street
:
 
in
the
latter
case
,
'
<EOS>
tis
draw
from
the
object
and
occurrence
without
<EOS>
;
  
when
your
eye
be
fix
upon
a
dead
blank
,
 
you
draw
purely
from
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
a
silence
of
a
single
moment
upon
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
's
leave
us
,
have
be
fatal
to
the
situation
 
she
have
infallibly
turn
about
;
 
<EOS>
so
I
begin
the
conversation
instantly
.
        
<EOS>
but
what
be
the
temptation
(
as
I
write
not
to
apologize
for
the
weakness
of
my
heart
in
this
tour
,
 
but
to
give
an
account
of
them
)
 
shall
be
describe
with
the
same
simplicity
with
which
I
feel
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
REMISE
DOOR
.
 
<EOS>
CALAIS
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
tell
the
reader
that
I
do
not
care
to
get
out
of
the
desobligeant
,
because
I
see
the
monk
in
close
conference
with
a
lady
just
arrive
at
the
inn
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
the
truth
,
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
tell
him
the
whole
truth
;
for
I
be
as
full
as
much
restrain
by
the
appearance
and
figure
of
the
lady
he
be
talk
to
.
 
<EOS>
suspicion
cross
my
brain
and
say
,
he
be
tell
her
what
have
pass
:
something
jar
upon
it
within
me
,
 
<EOS>
I
wish
him
at
his
convent
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
heart
fly
out
before
the
understanding
,
it
save
the
judgment
a
world
of
pain
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
certain
she
be
of
a
well
order
of
being
;
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
think
no
more
of
her
,
but
go
on
and
write
my
preface
.
  
<EOS>
the
impression
return
upon
my
encounter
with
her
in
the
street
;
a
guard
frankness
with
which
she
give
me
her
hand
,
show
,
I
think
,
her
good
education
and
her
good
sense
;
and
as
I
lead
her
on
,
I
feel
a
pleasurable
ductility
about
her
,
which
spread
a
calmness
over
all
my
spirit
        
Good
God
!
<EOS>
how
a
man
may
lead
such
a
creature
as
this
round
the
world
with
him
!
     
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
see
her
face
 
<EOS>
'
twas
not
material
:
 
for
the
drawing
be
instantly
set
about
,
and
long
before
we
have
get
to
the
door
of
the
Remise
,
Fancy
have
finish
the
whole
head
,
and
please
herself
as
much
with
its
fit
her
goddess
,
as
if
she
have
dive
into
the
Tiber
for
it
;
 
but
thou
art
a
seduce
,
and
a
seducing
slut
;
and
albeit
thou
cheatest
us
seven
time
a
day
with
thy
picture
and
image
,
yet
with
so
many
charm
dost
thou
do
it
,
and
thou
deck
out
thy
picture
in
the
shape
of
so
many
angel
of
light
,
'
tis
a
shame
to
break
with
thee
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
have
get
to
the
door
of
the
Remise
,
she
withdraw
her
hand
from
across
her
forehead
,
and
let
me
see
the
original
:
  
<EOS>
i
t
be
a
face
of
about
six
-
and
-
twenty
,
 
of
a
clear
transparent
brown
,
simply
set
off
without
rouge
or
powder
;
 
it
be
not
critically
handsome
,
but
there
be
that
in
it
,
which
,
in
the
frame
of
mind
I
be
in
,
attach
me
much
more
to
it
,
 
<EOS>
it
be
interesting
:
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
it
wear
the
character
of
a
widow'd
look
,
and
in
that
state
of
its
declension
,
which
have
pass
the
two
first
paroxysm
of
sorrow
,
and
be
quietly
begin
to
reconcile
itself
to
its
loss
;
 
but
a
thousand
other
distress
may
have
trace
the
same
line
;
I
wish'd
to
know
what
they
have
be
 
and
be
ready
to
inquire
,
(
have
the
same
bon
ton
of
conversation
permit
,
as
in
the
day
of
Esdras
)
 
<EOS>
"
what
ailelh
thee
?
<EOS>
and
why
art
thou
disquiet
?
<EOS>
and
why
be
thy
understanding
trouble
?
"
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
I
feel
benevolence
for
her
;
and
resolv'd
some
way
or
other
to
throw
in
my
mite
of
courtesy
,
 
if
not
of
service
.
  
<EOS>
such
be
my
temptation
;
 
and
in
this
disposition
to
give
way
to
them
,
be
I
leave
alone
with
the
lady
with
her
hand
in
mine
,
and
with
our
face
both
turn
closer
to
the
door
of
the
Remise
than
what
be
absolutely
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
the
REMISE
DOOR
.
 
<EOS>
CALAIS
.
  
<EOS>
this
certainly
,
fair
lady
,
say
I
,
raise
her
hand
up
little
lightly
as
I
begin
,
must
be
one
of
Fortune
's
whimsical
doing
;
to
take
two
utter
stranger
by
their
hand
,
 
of
different
sex
,
and
perhaps
from
different
corner
of
the
globe
,
and
in
one
moment
place
them
together
in
such
a
cordial
situation
as
friendship
herself
could
scarce
have
achieve
for
them
,
have
she
project
it
for
a
month
.
     
<EOS>
and
your
reflection
upon
it
show
how
much
,
Monsieur
,
she
have
embarrass
you
by
the
adventure
     
<EOS>
when
the
situation
be
what
we
would
wish
,
nothing
be
so
ill
-
time
as
to
hint
at
the
circumstance
which
make
it
so
:
 
<EOS>
you
thank
Fortune
,
continue
she
 
<EOS>
you
have
reason
 
<EOS>
the
heart
know
it
,
and
be
satisfied
;
and
who
but
an
english
philosopher
would
have
send
notice
of
it
to
the
brain
to
reverse
the
judgment
?
  
<EOS>
in
say
this
,
she
disengage
her
hand
with
a
look
which
I
think
a
sufficient
commentary
upon
the
text
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
miserable
picture
which
I
be
go
to
give
of
the
weakness
of
my
heart
,
by
own
,
that
it
suffer
a
pain
,
which
worthy
occasion
could
not
have
inflict
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
mortify
with
the
loss
of
her
hand
,
and
the
manner
in
which
I
have
lose
it
carry
neither
oil
nor
wine
to
the
wound
:
 
<EOS>
I
never
feel
the
pain
of
a
sheepish
inferiority
so
miserably
in
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
the
triumph
of
a
true
feminine
heart
be
short
upon
these
discomfiture
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
very
few
second
she
lay
her
hand
upon
the
cuff
of
my
coat
,
in
order
to
finish
her
reply
;
so
,
some
way
or
other
<EOS>
,
God
know
how
,
I
regain
my
situation
.
     
<EOS>
She
have
nothing
to
add
.
  
<EOS>
I
forthwith
begin
to
model
a
different
conversation
for
the
lady
,
think
from
the
spirit
as
well
as
moral
of
this
,
that
I
have
be
mistake
in
her
character
;
but
upon
turn
her
face
towards
me
,
the
spirit
which
have
animate
the
reply
be
flee
,
 
the
muscle
relaxed
,
and
I
beheld
the
same
unprotected
look
of
distress
which
first
win
me
to
her
interest
:
  
m
elancholy
!
<EOS>
to
see
such
sprightliness
the
prey
of
sorrow
,
 
I
pity
her
from
my
soul
;
and
though
it
may
seem
ridiculous
enough
to
a
torpid
heart
,
 
I
could
have
take
her
into
my
arm
,
and
cherish
her
,
though
it
be
in
the
open
street
,
without
brush
.
  
<EOS>
the
pulsation
of
the
artery
along
my
finger
press
across
her
,
tell
her
what
be
pass
within
me
:
 
she
look
down
 
a
silence
of
some
moment
follow
.
  
<EOS>
I
fear
in
this
interval
,
I
must
have
make
some
slight
effort
towards
a
close
compression
of
her
hand
,
from
a
subtle
sensation
<EOS>
I
feel
in
the
palm
of
my
own
,
 
not
as
if
she
be
go
to
withdraw
her
 
<EOS>
but
as
if
she
think
about
it
;
 
and
I
have
infallibly
lose
it
a
second
time
,
have
not
instinct
more
than
reason
direct
me
to
the
last
resource
in
these
danger
,
 
to
hold
it
loosely
,
and
in
a
manner
as
if
I
be
every
moment
go
to
release
it
,
of
myself
;
so
she
let
it
continue
,
till
Monsieur
Dessein
return
with
the
key
;
and
in
the
mean
time
I
set
myself
to
consider
how
I
should
undo
the
ill
impression
which
the
poor
monk
's
story
,
in
case
he
have
tell
it
her
,
must
have
plant
in
her
breast
against
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
SNUFF
BOX
.
 
<EOS>
CALAIS
.
  
<EOS>
the
good
old
monk
be
within
six
pace
of
us
,
as
the
idea
of
him
cross
my
mind
;
and
be
advance
towards
us
a
little
out
of
the
line
,
as
if
uncertain
whether
he
should
break
in
upon
us
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
He
stopp'd
,
however
,
as
soon
as
he
come
up
to
us
,
with
a
world
of
frankness
:
 
and
have
a
horn
snuff
box
in
his
hand
,
he
present
it
open
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
taste
mine
 
<EOS>
say
I
,
pull
out
my
box
(
which
be
a
small
tortoise
one
)
and
put
it
into
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
'
Tis
most
excellent
,
say
the
monk
.
 
<EOS>
then
do
me
the
favour
,
I
reply
,
to
accept
of
the
box
and
all
,
and
when
you
take
a
pinch
out
of
it
,
sometimes
recollect
it
be
the
peace
offering
of
a
man
who
once
use
you
unkindly
,
but
not
from
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
the
poor
monk
<EOS>
blush'd
<EOS>
as
red
as
scarlet
.
 
<EOS>
Mon
Dieu
!
<EOS>
say
he
,
press
his
hand
together
 
<EOS>
you
never
use
me
unkindly
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
think
,
say
the
lady
,
he
be
not
likely
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
blush'd
<EOS>
in
my
turn
;
but
from
what
movement
,
I
leave
to
the
few
who
feel
,
to
analyze
.
  
<EOS>
excuse
me
,
Madame
,
reply
I
,
 
<EOS>
I
treat
him
most
unkindly
;
and
from
no
provocation
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
impossible
,
say
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
My
God
!
cry
the
monk
,
with
a
warmth
of
asseveration
which
seem'd
not
to
belong
to
him
 
<EOS>
the
fault
be
in
me
,
and
in
the
indiscretion
of
my
zeal
.
 
<EOS>
the
lady
oppose
it
,
and
I
join
with
her
in
maintain
<EOS>
it
be
impossible
,
that
a
spirit
so
regulated
as
his
,
could
give
offence
to
any
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
not
that
contention
could
be
render
so
sweet
and
pleasurable
a
thing
to
the
nerve
as
I
then
feel
it
.
 
<EOS>
We
remain
silent
,
without
any
sensation
of
that
foolish
pain
which
take
place
,
when
,
in
such
a
circle
,
you
look
for
ten
minute
in
one
another
's
face
without
say
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
whilst
<EOS>
this
last
,
the
monk
rub
his
horn
box
upon
the
sleeve
of
his
tunic
;
and
as
soon
as
it
have
acquire
a
little
air
of
brightness
by
the
friction
 
he
make
me
a
low
bow
,
and
say
,
'
twas
too
late
to
say
whether
it
be
the
weakness
or
goodness
of
our
temper
which
have
involve
us
in
this
contest
 
but
be
it
as
it
would
,
 
<EOS>
he
<EOS>
begg'd
<EOS>
we
may
exchange
box
.
 
<EOS>
in
say
this
,
he
present
his
to
me
with
one
hand
,
as
he
take
mine
from
me
in
the
other
,
and
have
kiss
it
,
 
with
a
stream
of
good
nature
in
his
eye
,
he
put
it
into
his
bosom
,
 
and
take
his
leave
.
  
<EOS>
I
guard
this
box
,
as
I
would
the
instrumental
part
of
my
religion
,
to
help
my
mind
on
to
something
well
:
 
in
truth
,
I
seldom
go
abroad
without
it
;
and
oft
and
many
a
time
<EOS>
have
I
call
up
by
it
the
courteous
spirit
of
its
owner
to
regulate
my
own
,
in
the
justling
of
the
world
:
 
<EOS>
they
have
find
full
employment
for
his
,
as
I
learn
from
his
story
,
till
about
the
forty
-
fifth
year
of
his
age
,
when
upon
some
military
service
ill
requite
,
and
meeting
at
the
same
time
with
a
disappointment
in
the
tender
of
passion
,
he
abandon
the
sword
and
the
sex
together
,
and
take
sanctuary
not
so
much
in
his
convent
as
in
himself
.
  
<EOS>
I
feel
a
damp
upon
my
spirit
,
as
I
be
go
to
add
,
that
in
my
last
return
through
Calais
,
upon
enquire
after
Father
Lorenzo
,
I
hear
he
have
be
dead
near
three
month
,
and
be
bury
,
not
in
his
convent
,
but
,
accord
to
his
desire
,
in
a
little
cemetery
belong
to
it
,
about
two
league
off
:
 
I
have
a
strong
desire
to
see
where
they
have
lay
him
,
 
when
,
upon
pull
out
his
little
horn
box
,
as
I
sit
by
his
grave
,
and
pluck
up
a
nettle
or
two
at
the
head
of
it
,
which
have
no
business
to
grow
there
,
they
all
strike
together
so
forcibly
upon
my
affection
,
that
I
burst
into
a
flood
of
tear
:
  
<EOS>
b
ut
I
be
as
weak
as
a
woman
;
and
I
beg
the
world
not
to
smile
,
but
to
pity
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
REMISE
DOOR
.
 
<EOS>
CALAIS
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
never
quit
the
lady
's
hand
all
this
time
,
and
have
hold
it
so
long
,
that
it
would
have
be
indecent
to
have
let
it
go
,
without
first
press
it
to
my
lip
:
 
the
blood
and
spirit
,
which
have
suffer
a
revulsion
from
her
,
crowd
back
to
her
as
I
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
now
the
two
traveller
,
who
have
speak
to
me
in
the
coach
-
yard
,
happen
at
that
crisis
to
be
pass
by
,
and
observe
our
communication
,
naturally
take
it
into
their
head
that
we
must
be
MAN
and
WIFE
at
least
;
so
,
stop
as
soon
as
they
come
up
to
the
door
of
the
Remise
,
the
one
of
them
who
be
the
Inquisitive
Traveller
,
ask'd
us
,
if
we
set
out
for
Paris
the
next
morning
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
only
answer
for
myself
,
I
say
;
and
the
lady
add
,
she
be
for
Amiens
.
 
<EOS>
We
dine
there
yesterday
,
say
the
Simple
Traveller
.
  
<EOS>
You
go
directly
through
the
town
,
add
the
other
,
in
your
road
to
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
return
a
thousand
thank
for
the
intelligence
<EOS>
,
that
AMIENS
be
in
the
road
to
PARIS
,
but
,
upon
pull
out
my
poor
monk
's
little
horn
box
to
take
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
I
make
them
a
quiet
bow
,
and
wish
them
a
good
passage
to
Dover
.
 
<EOS>
They
leave
us
alone
.
        
<EOS>
now
where
would
be
the
harm
,
say
I
to
myself
,
if
I
be
to
beg
of
this
distressed
lady
to
accept
of
half
of
my
chaise
?
 
<EOS>
and
what
mighty
mischief
could
ensue
?
  
<EOS>
every
dirty
passion
,
and
bad
propensity
in
my
nature
take
the
alarm
,
as
I
state
the
proposition
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
oblige
you
to
have
a
third
horse
,
say
Avarice
,
which
will
put
twenty
livre
out
of
your
pocket
;
 
<EOS>
You
know
not
what
she
be
,
say
caution
;
 
or
what
scrape
the
affair
may
draw
you
into
,
whisper'd
Cowardice

<EOS>
Depend
upon
it
,
Yorick
!
<EOS>
say
Discretion
,
'
twill
be
say
you
go
off
with
a
mistress
,
and
come
by
assignation
to
Calais
for
that
purpose
;
        
You
can
never
after
,
cry
Hypocrisy
aloud
,
show
your
face
in
the
world
;
 
or
rise
,
quoth
Meanness
,
in
the
church
;
 
or
be
any
thing
in
it
,
say
Pride
,
but
a
lousy
prebendary
.
  
<EOS>
but
'
tis
a
civil
thing
,
say
I
;
 
<EOS>
and
as
I
generally
act
from
the
first
impulse
,
and
therefore
seldom
listen
to
these
cabal
,
which
serve
no
purpose
,
that
I
know
of
,
but
to
encompass
the
heart
with
adamant
 
<EOS>
I
turn
instantly
about
to
the
lady
.
        
<EOS>
but
she
have
glide
off
unperceived
,
as
the
cause
be
plead
,
and
have
make
ten
or
a
dozen
pace
down
the
street
,
by
the
time
I
have
make
the
determination
;
so
I
set
off
after
her
with
a
long
stride
,
to
make
her
the
proposal
,
with
the
good
address
<EOS>
I
be
master
of
:
 
but
observe
she
<EOS>
walk'd
<EOS>
with
her
cheek
half
rest
upon
the
palm
of
her
hand
,
 
with
the
slow
short
-
measur'd
step
of
thoughtfulness
,
 
and
with
her
eye
,
as
she
go
step
by
step
,
fix
upon
the
ground
,
it
strike
me
she
be
try
the
same
cause
herself
.
 
<EOS>
God
help
her
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
she
have
some
mother
-
in
-
law
,
or
tartufish
aunt
,
or
nonsensical
old
woman
,
to
consult
upon
the
occasion
,
as
well
as
myself
:
 
so
not
care
to
interrupt
the
process
,
and
deem
it
more
gallant
to
take
her
at
discretion
than
by
surprise
,
I
face
about
and
take
a
short
turn
or
two
before
the
door
of
the
Remise
,
whilst
she
walk'd
<EOS>
muse
on
one
side
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
CALAIS
.
  
<EOS>
have
,
on
the
first
sight
of
the
lady
,
settle
the
affair
in
my
fancy
"
that
she
be
of
the
well
order
of
being
;
"
 
and
then
lay
it
down
as
a
second
axiom
,
as
indisputable
as
the
first
,
that
she
be
a
widow
,
and
wear
a
character
of
distress
,
 
<EOS>
I
go
no
further
;
I
get
grind
enough
for
the
situation
which
please
me
;
 
and
have
she
remain
close
beside
my
elbow
till
midnight
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
hold
true
to
my
system
,
and
consider
her
only
under
that
general
idea
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
scarce
get
twenty
pace
distant
from
me
,
ere
something
within
me
call
out
for
a
more
particular
enquiry
;
 
it
bring
on
the
idea
of
a
further
separation
:
  
<EOS>
I
 
may
possibly
never
see
her
more
:
  
<EOS>
t
he
heart
be
for
save
what
it
can
;
and
I
want
the
trace
through
which
my
wish
may
find
their
way
to
her
,
in
case
I
should
never
rejoin
her
myself
;
in
a
word
,
I
wish
to
know
her
name
,
 
her
family
's
 
her
condition
;
and
as
I
know
the
place
to
which
she
be
go
,
I
want
to
know
from
whence
she
come
:
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
come
at
all
this
intelligence
;
a
hundred
little
delicacy
stand
in
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
form'd
<EOS>
a
score
different
plan
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
such
thing
as
a
man
's
ask
her
directly
;
 
the
thing
be
impossible
.
  
<EOS>
a
little
french
debonnaire
captain
,
who
come
dance
down
the
street
,
show
me
it
be
the
easy

the
honour
to
present
him
to
the
lady

<EOS>
I

so

he

just
as
well

She

<EOS>
He
have
have
the
honour

he
say
,
to
be
at
the
bombardment
of
it
last
war

that
it

and
full
of
noblesse
when
the
Imperialists
be
drive
out
by
the
French
(
the

make
a
slight
courtesy
)
 
<EOS>
so
give
her
an
account
of
the
affair
,
and
of
the
share
he
have
have
in
it

<EOS>
he
begg'd
<EOS>
the
honour
to

look
back

and
,
without
stay
for
an
answer
 
dance
down

<EOS>
have
I
serve
seven
year
apprenticeship
to
good
breeding

I
could
not
have

as
much

<EOS>
the
REMISE
.
 
<EOS>
CALAIS
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
little
french
captain
leave
us
,
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
come
up
with
the
key
of
the
Remise
in
his
hand
,
and
forthwith
let
us
into
his
magazine
of
chaise
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
object
which
catch
my
eye
,
as
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
open'd
<EOS>
the
door
of
the
Remise
,
be
another
old
tatter'd
desobligeant
;
and
notwithstanding
it
be
the
exact
picture
of
that
which
have
hit
my
fancy
so
much
in
the
coach
-
yard
but
an
hour
before
,
 
the
very
sight
of
it
stirr'd
up
a
disagreeable
sensation
within
me
now
;
and
I
think
'
twa
a
churlish
beast
into
whose
heart
the
idea
could
first
enter
,
to
construct
such
a
machine
;
nor
have
I
much
more
charity
for
the
man
who
could
think
of
use
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
observe
the
lady
be
as
little
take
with
it
as
myself
:
 
so
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
lead
us
on
to
a
couple
of
chaise
which
stand
abreast
,
tell
us
,
as
he
recommend
them
,
that
they
have
be
purchase
by
my
lord
A.
and
B.
to
go
the
grand
tour
,
but
have
go
no
further
than
Paris
,
so
be
in
all
respect
as
good
as
new
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
too
good
;
 
so
<EOS>
I
pass'd
on
to
a
third
,
which
stand
behind
,
and
forthwith
begin
to
chaffer
for
the
price
.
 
<EOS>
but
'
twill
scarce
hold
two
,
say
I
,
open
the
door
and
get
in
.
 
<EOS>
have
the
goodness
,
Madame
,
say
Mons
.
<EOS>
Dessein
,
offer
his
arm
,
to
step
in
.
 
<EOS>
the
lady
hesitate
half
a
second
,
and
step
in
;
and
the
waiter
that
moment
beckon
to
speak
to
Mon
.
<EOS>
Dessein
,
he
shut
the
door
of
the
chaise
upon
us
,
and
leave
us
.
  
<EOS>
the
REMISE
.
 
<EOS>
CALAIS
.
  
<EOS>
c'est
bien
comique
,
'
tis
very
droll
,
say
the
lady
,
smile
,
from
the
reflection
that
this
be
the
second
time
we
a
have
be
leave
together
by
a
parcel
of
nonsensical
contingency
,
 
c'est
bien
comique
,
say
she
.
        
<EOS>
there
want
nothing
,
say
I
,
to
make
it
<EOS>
so
<EOS>
but
the
comic
use
which
the
gallantry
of
a
Frenchman
would
put
it
to
,
 
to
make
love
the
first
moment
,
and
an
offer
of
his
person
the
second
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
<EOS>
their
fort
,
reply
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
suppose
so
at
least
;
 
and
how
it
have
come
to
pass
,
continue
I
,
I
know
not
;
but
they
have
certainly
get
the
credit
of
understand
more
of
love
,
and
make
it
well
than
any
other
nation
upon
earth
;
but
,
for
my
own
part
,
I
think
them
arrant
bungler
,
and
in
truth
the
bad
set
of
marksman
that
ever
try
Cupid
's
patience
.
     
<EOS>
to
think
of
make
love
by
SENTIMENTS
!
  
<EOS>
I
should
as
soon
think
of
make
a
genteel
suit
of
clothe
out
of
remnant
:
  
a
nd
to
do
it
 
pop
 
at
first
sight
,
by
declaration
 
be
submit
the
offer
,
and
themselves
with
it
,
to
be
sift
with
all
their
pour
and
contre
,
by
an
unheated
mind
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
attend
as
if
she
expect
I
should
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
consider
then
,
Madame
,
continue
I
,
lay
my
hand
upon
her
:
    
<EOS>
that
grave
people
hate
love
for
the
name
's
sake
;
     
that
selfish
people
hate
it
for
their
own
;
     
Hypocrites
for
heaven
's
;
     
and
that
all
of
us
,
both
old
and
young
,
be
ten
time
bad
frightened
than
hurt
by
the
very
report
,
 
what
a
want
of
knowledge
in
this
branch
of
commence
<EOS>
a
man
betray
,
whoever
let
the
word
come
out
of
his
lip
,
till
an
hour
or
two
,
at
least
,
after
the
time
that
his
silence
upon
it
become
torment
.
 
<EOS>
a
course
of
small
,
quiet
attention
,
not
so
pointed
as
to
alarm
,
 
nor
so
vague
as
to
be
misunderstood
 
with
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
look
of
kindness
,
and
little
or
nothing
say
upon
it
,
 
leave
nature
for
your
mistress
,
and
she
fashion
it
to
her
mind
.
     
<EOS>
then
I
solemnly
declare
,

the

blush
,
you
have
be

love
to

good

for
the

I
can
not
say
that
I
rejoice
in
my
heart
at
the

You

what
the

lay
her

upon

mine

<EOS>
a
man
my
good
Sir

have
seldom
an
offer
of
kindness
to
make
to
a

she
have
a
presentiment
of
it
some
moment
before

<EOS>
Nature
arm
her
with
it
,
say
I

for
immediate
preservation

but
I

look
in
my
face
,
I
have
no
evil
to
apprehend
,
  
and
,
to
deal
frankly
with
you

have
determine
to
accept
it
.
 
<EOS>
if
I
have
(
she
stop
a
moment
)
 
<EOS>
I
believe
your
good
will
would
have
draw
a
story
from
me
,
which
would
have
make
pity
the
only
dangerous
thing
in
the
journey
.
  
<EOS>
in
say
this
,
she
suffer
me
to
kiss
her
hand
twice
,
and
with
a
look
of
sensibility
mix
with
concern
,
she
get
out

my

upon

every

I

post

<EOS>
Lord

<EOS>
say
I
,
hear
the
town
clock
strike
four
,
and
recollect
that
I
have
be
little
more
than
a
single
hour
in
Calais
,
        
what
a
large
volume
of
adventure
may
be
grasp
within
this
little
span
of
life
by
him
who
interest
his
heart
in
every

who

have
eye
to
see
what
time
and
chance
be
perpetually

out

the

the
experiment
have
keep
my
sense

the
good
part

awake
,

lay
the
gross
to

I
pity
the
man

can
travel
from

cry

I
declare
,

clap
my

cheerily
together

that
be
I
in

I
would
find
out
wherewith
in

call
forth
my
affection

<EOS>
I
could
not
do
better
,
I
would
fasten
them
upon
some
sweet
myrtle
,
or
seek
some
melancholy
cypress
to
connect
myself
to
;
 
I
would
court
their
shade
,
and
greet
them
kindly
for
their
protection
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
cut
my
name
upon
them
,
and
swear
they
be
the
lovely
tree
throughout
the
desert
:
 
if
their
leave
wither'd
,
I
would
teach
myself
to
mourn
;
and
,
when
they
rejoice
,
I
would
rejoice
along
with
them

<EOS>
the
learned
Smelfungus
travel
from
Boulogne

from

he

every

I
have
hear
he
have
fall
foul
upon
the

and
use
her
bad
than
a
common
strumpet

without
the
least
provocation
in

<EOS>
I
popp'd
upon
Smelfungus
again
at
Turin
,
in
his
return
home
;
and
a
sad
tale
of
sorrowful
adventure
have
he
to
tell
,
"
wherein
he
speak
of
move
accident
by
flood
and
field
,
and
of
the
cannibal
that
each

eat
:
 
the
Anthropophagi
:
"
 
he
have
be
flay
alive
,
and
bedevil'd
,
and
use
bad
than
St.
Bartholomew
,
at
every
stage

have
come
at

<EOS>
I
will
tell
it
,
cry
Smelfungus

to
the

<EOS>
You
have
better
tell
it

say
I
,
to
your

Mundungus

to
Vienna
,
 
to
Dresden
,
to
Berlin
,
without
one
generous
connection
or
pleasurable
anecdote
to
tell
of

he

travell'd
straight
on
,
look
neither
to
his
right

nor
his

l
love
or
Pity

him
out

<EOS>
peace
be
to
them
!
<EOS>
if
it
be
to

find
;
but
heaven
itself
,
be
it
possible
to
get
there
with
such
temper
,
would
want
object
to
give
it
;
every
gentle
spirit
would
come
fly
upon
the
wing
of
love
to
hail
their
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
would
the
soul
of
Smelfungus
and
Mundungus
hear
of
,
but
fresh
anthem
of
joy
,
fresh
rapture
of
love
,
and
fresh
congratulation
of
their
common
felicity
.
 
<EOS>
I
heartily
pity
them
;
they
have
bring
up
no
faculty
for
this
work
;
and
,
be
the
happy
mansion
in
heaven
to
be
allot
to
Smelfungus
and
Mundungus
<EOS>
,
they
would
be
so
far
from

happy

that
the
soul
of
Smelfungus

do
penance
there
to

one
of

because

Monsieur

a
clever
young

who
would
be
very
proud
of
the

to
serve
an
Englishman

why
an
english
one

more
than
any
other

<EOS>
They
be
so
generous

say
the
landlord

<EOS>
I
will
be
shoot

Set

It

last

the

take
the

I

<EOS>
I
can
not

once
for

,
that
tant
pis
and
tant

be
two
of
the
great
hinge
in

a

would
do
well
to
set

right
in
the
use

before

get
to

a

<EOS>
when
the
landlord
have
set
me
right
in
this
matter
,
he
call
in
La
Fleur
,
which
be
the
name
of
the
young
man
he
have
speak
of
,
 
say
only
first
,
that
as
for
his
talent
he
would
presume
to
say
nothing
,
 
Monsieur
be
the
good
judge
what
would
suit
him
;
but
for
the
fidelity
of
La
Fleur
he
would
stand
responsible
in
all
he
be
worth
.
  
<EOS>
the
landlord
deliver'd
this
in
a
manner
which
instantly
set
my
mind
to
the
business
I
be
upon
;
 
and
La
Fleur
,
who
stand
wait
without
,
in
that
breathless
expectation
which
every
son
of
nature
of
us
have
feel
in
our
turn

come
in

<EOS>
MONTREUIL
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
apt
to
be
take
with
all
kind
of
people
at
first
sight
;
but
never
more
so
than
when
a
poor
devil
come
to
offer
his
service
to
so
poor
a
devil
as
myself
;
and
as
I
know
this
weakness
,
I
always
suffer
my
judgment
to
draw
back
something
on
that
very
account
,
  
and
this
more
or
less
,
accord
to
the
mood
I
be
in
,
and
the
case
;
 
and
I
may
add
,
the
gender
too
,
of
the
person
I
be
to
govern
.
  
<EOS>
when
La
Fleur
enter
the
room
,
after
every
discount
I
could
make
for
my
soul
,
the
genuine
look
and
air
of
the
fellow
determine
the
matter
at
once
in
his
favour
;
so
I
hire
him
first
,
 
and
then
begin
to
enquire
what
he
could
do
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
shall
find
out
his
talent
,
quoth
<EOS>
I
,
as
I
want
them
,
 
besides
,
a
Frenchman
can
do
every
thing
.
  
<EOS>
now
poor
La
Fleur
could
do
nothing
in
the
world
but
beat
a
drum
,
and
play
a
march
or
two
upon
the
fife
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
determined
to
make
his
talent
do
;
and
can
not
say
my
weakness
be
ever
so
insult
by
my
wisdom
as
in
the
attempt
.
  
<EOS>
La
Fleur
have
set
out
early
in
life
,
as
gallantly
as
most
frenchman
do
,
with
serve
for
a
few
year
;
at
the
end
of
which
,
have
satisfy
the
sentiment
,
and
find
,
moreover
,
that
the
honour
of
beat
a
drum
be
likely
to
be
its
own
reward
,
as
it
open'd
no
further
track
of
glory
to
him
,
 
he
retire
a
ses
terre
,
and
live
comme
il
plaisoit
a
Dieu
;
 
that
be
to
say
,
upon
nothing
.
     
<EOS>
and
so
,
quoth
Wisdom
,
you
have
hire
a
drummer
to
attend
you
in
this
tour
of
yours
through
France
and
Italy
!
 
<EOS>
Psha
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
and
do
not
one
half
of
our
gentry
go
with
a
humdrum
compagnon
du
voyage
the
same
round
,
and
have
the
piper
and
the
devil
and
all
to
pay
besides
?
 
<EOS>
when
man
can
extricate
himself
with
an
equivoque
in
such
an
unequal
match
,
 
he
be
not
ill
off
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
can
do
something
else
,
<EOS>
La
Fleur
?
<EOS>
say
I.
 
o
qu'oui
!
<EOS>
he
could
make
spatterdashe
,
and
play
a
little
upon
the
fiddle
.
 
<EOS>
Bravo
!
<EOS>
say
wisdom
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
I
play
a
bass
myself
,
say
I
;
 
we
shall
do
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
shave
,
and
dress
a
wig
a
little
,
La

?
 
<EOS>
He
have
all
the
disposition
in
the
world

<EOS>
It
be
enough
for
heaven
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
interrupt
him
,
 
and
ought
to
be
enough
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
supper
come
in
,
and
have
a
frisky
English
spaniel
on
one
side
of
my
chair
,
and
a
french
valet
,
with
as
much
hilarity
in
his
countenance
as
ever
Nature
paint
in
one
,
on
the
other
,
 
<EOS>
I
be
satisfied
to
my
heart
's
content
with
my
empire
;
and
if
monarchs
know
what
they
would
be
at
,
they
may
be
as
satisfied

I
be

<EOS>
MONTREUIL

<EOS>
as
La

go
the
whole
tour
of
France
and
Italy
with
me
,
and
will
be
often
upon
the
stage
,
I
must
interest
the
reader
a
little
further
in
his
behalf
,
by
say
,
that
I
have
never
less
reason
to
repent
of
the
impulse
which
generally
do
determine
me
,
than
in
regard
to
this
fellow
;
 
he
be
a
faithful
,
affectionate
,
simple
soul
as
ever
trudge
after
the
heel
of
a
philosopher
;
and
,
notwithstanding
his
talent
of
drum
beating
and
spatterdash
-
making
,
which
,
though
very
good
in
themselves
,
happen
to
be
of
no
great
service
to
me
,
yet
be
I
hourly
recompense
by
the
festivity
of
his
temper
;
 
it
supply
all
defect
:
  
<EOS>
I
 
have
a
constant
resource
in
his
look
in
all
difficulty
and
distress
of
my
own
 
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
have
add
of
his
too
;
but
La
Fleur
be
out
of
the
reach
of
every
thing
;
for
,
whether
'
twas
hunger
or
thirst
,
or
cold
or
nakedness
,
or
watching
,
or
whatever
stripe
of
ill
luck
La
Fleur
meet
with
in
our
journeying
,
there
be
no
index
in
his
physiognomy
to
point
them
out
by
,
 
<EOS>
he
be
eternally
the
same
;
so
that
if
I
be
a
piece
of
a
philosopher
,
which
Satan
now
and
then
put
it
into
my
head
I
be
,
 
it
always
mortify
the
pride
of
the
conceit
,
by
reflect
how
much
I
owe
to
the
complexional
philosophy
of
this
poor
fellow
,
for
shame
me
into
one
of
a
well
kind
.
 
<EOS>
with
all
this
,
La
Fleur
have
a
small
cast
of
the
coxcomb
,
 
but
he
seem
at
first
sight
to
be
more
a
coxcomb
of
nature
than
of
art
;
and
,
before
I
have
be
three
day
in
Paris
with
him
,
 
he
seem
to
be
no
coxcomb
at
all
.

MONTREUIL

<EOS>
the
next
morning
,
La

enter
upon
his
employment

I
deliver
to

the
key
of
my
portmanteau
,
with
an
inventory
of
my
half
a
dozen
shirt
and
silk
pair

fasten
all
upon

get
the
horse
put

desire
the

to
come

<EOS>
c'est

point
through

half
a

who
have
get
round
about

La

thrice
<EOS>
he
wipe
his
eye

and
thrice
<EOS>
he
promise
he
would
bring
them
all
pardon
from
Rome

<EOS>
the
young
fellow
,
say
the
landlord
,
be
beloved
by
all
the
town
,
and
there
be
scarce
a
corner
in
Montreuil
where
the
want
of
him
will
not
be
feel
:
 
<EOS>
he
have
<EOS>
but
one
misfortune
in
the
world
,
continue
he
,
"
he
be
always
in

I
be
heartily
glad
of
it
,
say
I

"
twill
save
me
the
trouble
every
night
of
put
my

<EOS>
in
say
this

I
be
make
not

much
La

eloge
as
my

have
be
in

with

I
hope
I
shall
go
on
<EOS>
so
till
I
die

be
firmly
persuade
,
that
if
ever
I
do
a
mean
action
,
it
must
be
in
some
interval

another

<EOS>
whilst
this
interregnum
last

I
always
perceive
my

lock
up
,
 
<EOS>
I
can
scarce
find
in
it
to
give
Misery
a
sixpence
;
and
therefore
I
always
get
out
of
it
as
fast
as
I
can
 
and
<EOS>
the
moment
I
be
rekindle
,
I
be
all
generosity

good
-
will
again
;

would
do
anything
in
the
world
,
either
for
or
with
any
one
,
if
they
will
but
satisfy
me
there
be
no
sin
in
it

<EOS>
but
in

this

sure
I
be
command
the
passion

the

notwithstanding

live
there
,
try
all
the
power
of
irony

of

the
passage

nothing
operate
more
upon

the

nature
which
the

work
up
in

pathetic
speech
of
Perseus

O

for

give
so
little

I
do

for

that

have
so
little
to
give

but
as
this
be
the
first
public
act

I
take
the
more
notice

it

<EOS>
a

<EOS>
say
I
,
 
I
have
<EOS>
but
eight

show
them
in

and
there
be
eight
poor

eight
poor

for

<EOS>
a
poor
tatter'd
soul
,
without

instantly
withdraw
his

,
by
retire
two
step
out
of

make
a

bow
on

<EOS>
have
the
whole

cry
out

Place

with
one

it

not

<EOS>
just
Heaven

<EOS>
for

thou
order
it

that
beggary

which
be

should
find
a
way
to
be
at
unity
in
this
?
     
<EOS>
I
insist
upon
present
him
with
a
single
sous
,
merely
for
his
politesse
.
  
<EOS>
a
poor
little
dwarfish
brisk
fellow
,
who
stand
over
against
me
in
the
circle
,
put
something
first
under
his
arm
,
which
have
once
be
a
hat
,
take
his
snuff
-
box
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
generously
offer'd
<EOS>
a
pinch
on
both
side
of
him
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
gift
of
consequence
,
and
modestly
decline
.
  
<EOS>
t
he
poor
little
fellow
press
it
upon

with
a
nod
of
welcomeness
.
 
<EOS>
Prenez

say
he
,
look
another

so
they
each
take
a
pinch
.
 
<EOS>
Pity
thy
box
should
ever
want
one
!
<EOS>
say
I
to
myself
;
so
I
put
a
couple
of
sous
into
it
 
take
a
small
pinch
out
of
his
box
,
to
enhance
their
value
,
as
I
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
feel
the
weight
of
the
second
obligation
more
than
of
the
first
,
 
'
twas
do
him
an
honour
,
 
the
other
be
only
do
him
a
charity
;
 
and
he
make
me
a
bow
down
to
the
ground
for
it
.
     
<EOS>
here
!
say
I
to
an
old

with
one
hand

who
have
be
campaign

wear
out
to
death
in
the
service
 
<EOS>
here
be
a
couple
of
sous
for
thee
.
 
<EOS>
Vive

say
the
old
soldier
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
then
but
three
sous
left
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
give
one
,
simply
,
pour
l'amour
de
Dieu
,
which
be
the
footing
on
which
it
be
begg'd

<EOS>
the
poor

have
a

so
it
could
not

Monsieur

<EOS>
there
be
no
oppose
this
,
say
I.
  
Milord
Anglois
 
<EOS>
the
very
sound
be
worth
the
money
;
 
<EOS>
so
I
give
my
last
sous
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
the
eagerness
of
giving
,
I
have
overlook
a
pauvre
honteux
,
who
have
have
no
one
to
ask
a
sous
for
him
,
and
who
,
I
believe
,
would
have
perish
,
ere
he
could
have
ask'd
one
for
himself
:
 
<EOS>
he
stand
by
the
chaise
a
little
without
the
circle
,
and
wipe
a
tear
from
a
face
which
I
think
have
see
well
day
.
  
<EOS>
-Good
God
!
say
I
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
not
one
single
sous
left
to
give
him
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
have
a
thousand
!
<EOS>
cry
all
the
power
of
nature
,
stir
within
me
;
 
<EOS>
so
I
give
him
 
no
matter
what
 
I
be
ashamed
to
say
how
much
now
,
 
and
be
ashamed
to
think
how
little
,
then
:
 
<EOS>
so
,
if
the
reader
can
form
any
conjecture
of
my
disposition
,
as
these
two
fix
point
be
give
him
,
he
may
judge
within
a
livre
or
two
<EOS>
what
be
the
precise
sum
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
afford
nothing
for
the
rest
,
but
Dieu
vous
benisse
!
     
<EOS>
Et
le
bon
Dieu
vous
benisse
encore
,
say
the
old
soldier
,
the
dwarf
,
&
c.
 
<EOS>
the
pauvre
honteux
could
say
nothing
;
 
he
pull'd
out
a
little
handkerchief
,
and
wipe
his
face
as
he
turn
away
 
<EOS>
and
I
think
he
thank
me
more
than
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
the
BIDET
.
  
<EOS>
have
settle
all
these
little
matter
,
I
get
into
my
post
-
chaise
with
more
ease
than
ever
I
get
into
a
post
-
chaise
in
my
life
;
and
La
Fleur
have
get
one
large
jack
-
boot
on
the
far
side
of
a
little
bidet
,
and
another
on
this
(
for
I
count
nothing
of
his
leg
)
 
<EOS>
he
canter'd
away
before
me
as
happy
and
as
perpendicular
as
a
prince
.
  
<EOS>
-But
<EOS>
what
be
happiness
!
<EOS>
what
be
grandeur
in
this
paint
scene
of
life
!
 
<EOS>
a
dead
ass
,
before
we
have
get
a
league
,
put
a
sudden
stop
to
La
Fleur
's
career
;
 
his
bidet
would
not
pass
by
it
,
 
<EOS>
a
contention
arise
betwixt
them
,
and
the
poor
fellow
be
kick'd
out
of
his
jack
-
boot
the
very
first
kick
.
  
<EOS>
La
Fleur
bear
his
fall
like
a
french
Christian
,
say
neither
more
nor
less
upon
it
,
than
Diable
!
 
<EOS>
so
presently
get
up
,
and
come
to
the
charge
again
astride
his
bidet
,
beat
him
up
to
it
as
he
would
have
beat
his
drum
.
  
<EOS>
the
bidet
fly
from
one
side
of
the
road
to
the
other
,
then
back
again
,
 
then
this
way
,
then
that
way
,
and
in
short
,
every
way
but
by
the
dead
ass
:
  
l
a
Fleur
insist
upon
the
thing
 
and
the
bidet
throw
him
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
the
matter
,
La
Fleur
,
say
I
,
with
this
bidet
of
thine
?
<EOS>
Monsieur
,
say
he
,
c'est
un
cheval
le
plus
opiniatre
du
monde
.
  
<EOS>
Nay
,
if
he
be
a
conceited
beast
,
he
must
go
his
own
way
,
reply
<EOS>
I.
so
La
Fleur
get
off
him
,
and
give
him
a
good
sound
lash
,
the
bidet
take
me
at
my
word
,
and
away
he
scamper
back
to
Montreuil
.
  
<EOS>
-Peste
<EOS>
!
say
La
Fleur
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
mal
-
a
-
propos
to
take
notice
here
,
that
though
La
Fleur
avail
himself
but
of
two
different
term
of
exclamation
in
this
encounter
,
 
namely
,
diable
!
<EOS>
and
Peste
!
<EOS>
that
there
be
,
nevertheless
,
three
in
the
french
language
:
 
like
the
positive
,
comparative
,
and
superlative
,
one
or
the
other
of
which
serve
for
every
unexpected
throw
of
the
dice
in
life
.
  
<EOS>
Le
Diable
!
<EOS>
which
be
the
first
,
and
positive
degree
,
be
generally
use
upon
ordinary
emotion
of
the
mind
,
where
small
thing
only
fall
out
contrary
to
your
expectation
;
such
as
 
the
throwing
once
doublet
 
<EOS>
La
Fleur
's
be
kick'd
<EOS>
off
his
horse
,
and
so
forth
.
  
<EOS>
Cuckoldom
,
for
the
same
reason
,
be
always
 
Le
Diable
!
  
<EOS>
but
,
in
case
where
the
cast
have
something
provoke
in
it
,
as
in
that
of
the
bidet
's
run
away
after
,
and
leave
La
Fleur
aground
in
jack
-
boot
,
 
'
tis
the
second
degree
.
  
<EOS>
@@@Tis
then
Peste
!
  
<EOS>
and
for
the
third
        
<EOS>
but
here
my
heart
be
wrung
with
pity
and
fellow
feeling
,
when
I
reflect
what
misery
must
have
be
their
lot
,
and
how
bitterly
so
refine
a
people
must
have
smart
,
to
have
force
them
upon
the
use
of
it
.
     
<EOS>
Grant
me
,
<EOS>
o
ye
power
which
touch
the
tongue
with
eloquence
in
distress
!
 
<EOS>
what
ever
be
my
CAST
,
grant
me
but
decent
word
to
exclaim
in
,
and
I
will
give
my
nature
way
.
     
<EOS>
but
as
these
be
not
to
be
have
in
France
,
I
resolve
to
take
every
evil
just
as
it
befall
me
,
without
any
exclamation
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
La
Fleur
,
who
have
make
no
such
covenant
with
himself
,
follow
the
bidet
with
his
eye
till
it
be
get
out
of
sight
,
 
and
then
,
you
may
imagine
,
if
you
please
,
with
what
word
he
close
the
whole
affair
.
  
<EOS>
as
there
be
no
hunting
down
a
frightened
horse
in
jack
-
boot
,
there
remain
no
alternative
but
take
La
Fleur
either
behind
the
chaise
,
or
into
it
.
     
<EOS>
I
prefer
the
latter
,
and
in
half
an
hour
we
get
to
the
post
-
house
at
Nampont
.
  
<EOS>
NAMPONT
.
 
<EOS>
the
DEAD
ASS
.
     
<EOS>
and
this
,
say
he
,
put
the
remain
of
a
crust
into
his
wallet
 
and
this
should
have
be
thy
portion
,
say
he
,
hadst
thou
be
alive
to
have
share
it
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
by
the
accent
,
it
have
be
an
apostrophe
to
his
child
;
<EOS>
but
'
twa
to
his
ass
,
and
to
the
very
ass
we
have
see
dead
in
the
road
,
which
have
occasion
La
Fleur
's
misadventure
.
 
<EOS>
the
man
seem
to
lament
it
much
;
and
it
instantly
bring
into
my
mind
Sancho
's
lamentation
for
his
;
but
he
do
it
with
more
true
touch
of
nature
.
  
<EOS>
the
mourner
be
sit
upon
a
stone
bench
at
the
door
,
with
the
ass
's
pannel
and
its
bridle
on
one
side
,
which
he
take
up
from
time
to
time
,
 
then
lay
them
down
,
 
look'd
at
them
,
and
shake
his
head
.
<EOS>
He
then
take
his
crust
of
bread
out
of
his
wallet
again
,
as
if
to
eat
it
;
hold
it
some
time
in
his
hand
,
 
then
lay
it
upon
the
bit
of
his
ass
's
bridle
,
 
look
wistfully
at
the
little
arrangement
he
have
make
 
and
then
give
a
sigh
.
  
<EOS>
the
simplicity
of
his
grief
draw
number
about
him
,
and
La
Fleur
amongst
the
rest
,
whilst
the
horse
be
get
ready
;
as
I
continue
sit
in
the
post
-
chaise
,
I
could
see
and
hear
over
their
head
.
     
<EOS>
He
say
he
have
come
last
from
Spain
,
where
he
have
be
from
the
furth
border
of
Franconia
;
and
have
get
so
far
on
his
return
home
,
when
his
ass
die
.
 
<EOS>
every
one
seem
desirous
to
know
what
business
could
have
take
so
old
and
poor
a
man
so
far
a
journey
from
his
own
home
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
please
heaven
,
he
say
,
to
bless
him
with
three
son
,
the
fine
lad
in
Germany
;
but
have
in
one
week
lose
two
of
the
eld
of
them
by
the
small
-
pox
,
and
the
young
fall
ill
of
the
same
distemper
,
he
be
afraid
of
be
bereft
of
them
all
;
and
make
a
vow
,
if
heaven
would
not
take
him
from
him
also
,
he
would
go
in
gratitude
to
St.
Iago
in
Spain
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
mourner
get
thus
far
on
his
story
,
he
stopp'd
<EOS>
to
pay
Nature
her
tribute
,
 
and
weep
bitterly
.
  
<EOS>
He
say
,
heaven
have
accept
the
condition
;
and
that
he
have
set
out
from
his
cottage
with
this
poor
creature
,
who
have
be
a
patient
partner
of
his
journey
;
 
that
it
have
eat
the
same
bread
with
him
all
the
way
,
and
be
unto
him
as
a
friend
.
  
<EOS>
every
body
who
stand
about
,
hear
the
poor
fellow
with
concern
.
 
<EOS>
La
Fleur
offer
him
money
.
 
<EOS>
the
mourner
say
he
do
not
want
it
;
 
it
be
not
the
value
of
the
ass
 
<EOS>
but
the
loss
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
the
ass
,
he
say
,
he
be
assure
,
love
him
;
 
and
upon
this
tell
them
a
long
story
of
a
mischance
upon
their
passage
over
the
pyrenean
mountain
,
which
have
separate
them
from
each
other
three
day
;
during
which
time
the
ass
have
seek
him
as
much
as
he
have
seek
the
ass
,
and
that
they
have
scarce
either
eat
or
drank
till
they
meet
.
  
<EOS>
Thou
hast
<EOS>
one
comfort
,
friend
,
say
I
,
at
least
,
in
the
loss
of
thy
poor
beast
;
I
be
sure
thou
hast
be
a
merciful
master
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
alas
<EOS>

say
the
mourner
,
I
think
so
when
he
be
alive
;
 
but
now
that
he
be
dead
,
I
think
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
I
fear
the
weight
of
myself
and
my
affliction
together
have
be
too
much
for
him
,
 
<EOS>
they
have
shorten
the
poor
creature
's
day
,
and
I
fear
I
have
them
to
answer
for
.
 
<EOS>
shame
on
the
world
!
<EOS>
say
I
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
do
<EOS>
we
but
love
each
other
as
this
poor
soul
love
his
ass
"
twould
be
something

<EOS>
NAMPONT
.
 
<EOS>
the
POSTILION
.
  
<EOS>
the
concern
which
the
poor
fellow
's
story
throw
me
into
require
some
attention
;
the
postilion
pay
not
the
least
to
it
,
but
set
off
upon
the
pave
in
a
full
gallop
.
  
<EOS>
the
thirsty
soul
in
the
most
sandy
desert
of
Arabia
could
not
have
wish
more
for
a
cup
of
cold
water
,
than
mine
do
for
grave
and
quiet
movement
;
and
I
should
have
have
an
high
opinion
of
the
postilion
<EOS>
have
he
but
steal
off
with
me
in
something
like
a
pensive
pace
.
 
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
as
the
mourner
finish
his
lamentation
,
the
fellow
give
an
unfeeling
lash
to
each
of
his
beast
,
and
set
off
clatter
like
a
thousand
devil
.
  
<EOS>
I
call
to
him
as
loud
as
I
could
,
for
heaven
's
sake
to
go
slower
:
  
a
nd
<EOS>
the
loud
I
call
<EOS>
,
the
more
unmercifully
he
gallop
.
 
<EOS>
the
deuce
take
him
and
his
galloping
too
 
<EOS>
say
I
,
 
<EOS>
he
will
go
on
tear
my
nerve
to
piece
till
he
have
work
me
into
a
foolish
passion
,
and
then
he
will
go
slow
that
I
may
enjoy
the
sweet
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
postilion
manage
the
point
to
a
miracle
:
 
by
the
time
he
have
get
to
the
foot
of
a
steep
hill
,
about
half
a
league
from
Nampont
,
  
-he
have
put
me
out
of
temper
with
him
,
 
and
then
with
myself
,
for
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
My
case
then
require
a
different
treatment
;
and
a
good
rattling
gallop
would
have
be
of
real
service
to
me
.
        
<EOS>
then
,
prithee
,
get
on
 
get
on
,
my
good
lad
,
say
I.
  
<EOS>
the
postilion
point
to
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
try
to
return
back
to
the
story
of
the
poor
German
and
his
ass
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
break
the
clue
,
 
and
could
no
more
get
into
it
again
,
than
the
postilion
could
into
a
trot
.
     
<EOS>
the
deuce
go
,
say
I
,
with
it
all
!
 
<EOS>
here
be
I
sit
as
candidly
disposed
to
make
the
good
of
the
bad
,
as
ever
wight
be

and
all
run
counter

<EOS>
there
be
one
sweet
lenitive
at
least
for
evil
,
which
Nature
hold
out
to
us
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
take
it
kindly
at
her
hand

and
fall
asleep
;

the

which
rouse
me

Amiens

Bless

that
she
still

if

<EOS>
at
Brussels
;
 
'

only
return
from
Italy
through
Germany
to
Holland
,
by
the
route
of
flander

home

"
twill
scarce
be
ten
post
out

my
way

but
,
be
it
ten
thousand
!
<EOS>
with
what
a
moral
delight
will
it
crown
my
journey
,
in
share
in
the
sickening
incident
of
a
tale
of
misery
tell
to
me
by
such
a
sufferer

<EOS>
to
see
her
weep
!
<EOS>
and
,
though
I
can
not
dry
up
the
fountain

what
an
exquisite
sensation
be
there
still
leave

in
wipe
them
away
from
off
the
cheek
of
the
first
and
fair
of
woman

as
I
be
sit
with
my
handkerchief
in
my
hand
in
silence
the
whole
night
beside
her
?
  
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
wrong
in
the
sentiment
;
and
yet
I
instantly
reproach
my
heart
with
it
in
the
bitter
and
most
reprobate
of
expression
.
  
<EOS>
It
have
ever
,
as
I
tell
the
reader
,
be
one
of
the
singular
blessing
of
my
life
,
to
be
almost
every
hour
of
it
miserably
in
love
with
some
one
;
and
my
last
flame
happen
to
be
blow
out
by
a
whiff
of
jealousy
on
the
sudden
turn
of
a
corner
<EOS>
,
I
have
light
it
up
afresh
at
the
pure
taper
of
Eliza
but
about
three
month
before
,
 
<EOS>
swear
,
as
I
do
it
,
that
it
should
last
me
through
the
whole
journey
.
 
<EOS>
why
should
I
dissemble
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
swear
to
her
eternal
fidelity
;
 
she
have
a
right
to
my
whole
heart
:
  
<EOS>
t
o
divide
my
affection
be
to
lessen
them
;
 
to
expose
them
be
to
risk
them
:
 
where
there
be
risk
<EOS>
there
may
be
loss
:
  
a

what
wilt
<EOS>
thou
have
,
Yorick

to
answer
to
a
heart
so
full
of
trust
and
confidence
 
<EOS>
so
good
,
so
gentle
,
and
unreproache

<EOS>
I
will
not
go
to
Brussels
,
reply
I
,
interrupt
myself
.
 
<EOS>
but
my
imagination
go
on
,
 
<EOS>
I
recall
her
look
at
that
crisis
of
our
separation
,
when
neither
of
us
have
power
to
say
adieu
!
 
<EOS>
I
look'd
<EOS>
at
the
picture
she
have
tie
in
a
black
riband
about
my
neck
,
 
and
blush'd
as
I
look'd
<EOS>
at
it

<EOS>
I
would
have
give
the
world
to
have
kiss'd
<EOS>
it
,
 
but
be
ashamed
.
 
<EOS>
and
shall
this
tender
flower
,
say
I
,
press
it
between
my
hand
,
 
shall
it
be
smitten
to
its
very
root
,
 
and
smitten
,
Yorick

<EOS>
by
thee

who
hast
promise
to
shelter
it
in
thy
breast
?
  
<EOS>
Eternal
Fountain
of
Happiness

<EOS>
say
I

kneel
down
upon

be
thou
my
witness
 
and
every
pure
spirit
which
taste
it

be
my

also
,
that
I
would
not
travel
to
Brussels
,
unless
Eliza
go
along
with
me

do
the
road
lead
me
towards
heaven

<EOS>
in
transport
of

the

in

will
always

in

him
into

parlour
in
the
auberge

him
with

La

in

Madame

have
say
this
with
such
a
tone
of
reliance
upon
the
fact
,
that
La

have
not
power
to
disappoint
her
expectation
;
  
he
tremble
for
my
honour

and
possibly
may
not

be
unconcerned

<EOS>
so
that
when
Madame

ask
La

if
he
have
bring
a
letter
,
  
o
qu'oui

say
La

:
 
<EOS>
so
lay
down
his
hat
upon
the
ground
,
and
take
hold
of
the
flap
of
his
right
side
pocket
with
his

he
begin
to
search
for
the

with
his

then
contrariwise
.
 
<EOS>
Diable

<EOS>
then
seek
every
pocket
 
pocket
by
pocket
,
round
,
not
forget
his

:
  
Peste

<EOS>
then
La

empty
them
upon
the
floor
,
 
pull
out
a
dirty
cravat
,
 
a
handkerchief
,
 
a
comb

a

a
nightcap

then
give
a
peep
into

<EOS>
Quelle

<EOS>
He
have
leave
the
letter
upon
the
table
in
the
auberge
;
 
he
would
run
for
it
,
and
be
back
with
it
in
three
minute
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
just
finish
my
supper
when
La

give
me
an
account
of
his

<EOS>
he
tell
the
whole

and
only
add
that
if
Monsieur

forget
(
par

to
answer
Madame

,
the

give
him
an
opportunity

;
 
and
if
not

that
thing
be
only
as
they

<EOS>
now
I
be
not
altogether
sure
of
my
etiquette
,
whether
I
ought
to
have
write
or
no

<EOS>
but
if
I
have

a

could
not
have
be
angry
:

but
the
officious
zeal

La

out

like
lightning

and
return
with
pen

ink

and
paper

in
his

and
,
come
up
to
the

lay

close

with
such
a
delight
in
his

that
I
could
not

take
up
the

<EOS>
I
begin

begin
again

,
though
I
have
nothing
to

that
nothing
may
have
be
express
in
half

I
make
half

different
beginning

could
no

<EOS>
in
short
,
I
be
in

<EOS>
La

stepp'd
out
and
bring
a
little
water
in

glass
to
dilute
my

then
fetch'd
sand

<EOS>
It

Le

make
a

apology
for
the
liberty

a

signalize
himself
in

if
he

get
up

<EOS>
I

up
into

I
be
 
whatever

<EOS>
I
own

I

solitary

alone
in

chamber
in
the
hotel

be
far
from

so
flattering

I

<EOS>
I
walk
up
gravely
to
the
window
in
my
dusty
black

and
look
through
the
glass
see
all
the
world
in
yellow

blue

green

run
at
the
ring
of
pleasure

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
Alas

poor

<EOS>
cry
I

what
art
thou

here
?
 
<EOS>
on
the
very
first
onset
of
all
this
glitter

thou
art
reduce

an
atom

seek

seek
some
wind
alley
,
with
a
tourniquet
at
the
end

it

where
chariot
never

flambeau
shoot

there
thou
mayest
solace
thy
soul
in
converse
sweet
with
some
kind
grisette
of
a

and
get
into

<EOS>
May
I
perish

<EOS>
if
I
do

say
I

pull
out
the
letter
which
I
have
to
present
to
Madame

#
#
  
<EOS>
I
will
wait
upon
this
lady
,
the
very
first
thing
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
call
La
Fleur
to
go
seek
me
a
barber
directly
,
 
and
come
back
and
brush
my
coat
.
  
<EOS>
the
WIG

<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
barber
come
,
he
absolutely
refuse
to
have
any
thing
to
do
with
my
wig
:
 
'
twas
either
above
or
below
his
art
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
do
but
<EOS>
to
take
one
ready
make
of
his
own
recommendation
.
     
<EOS>
but
I
fear
,
friend
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
this
buckle
will
not
stand
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
emerge
it
,
reply
he
,
into
the
ocean
,
and
it
will
stand
.
     
<EOS>
what
a
great
scale
be
every
thing
upon
in
this
city
<EOS>
think
I.
 
<EOS>
the
utmost
stretch
of
an
english
periwig
-
maker
's
idea
could
have
go
no
further
than
to
have
"
dip
it
into
a
pail
of
water
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
what
difference
!
'
<EOS>
tis
like
time
to
Eternity
!
  
<EOS>
I
confess
I
do
hate
all
cold
conception
,
as
I
do
the
puny
idea
which
engender
them
;
and
be
generally
so
strike
with
the
great
work
of
nature
,
that
for
my
own
part
,
if
I
could
help
it
,
I
never
would
make
a
comparison
less
than
a
mountain
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
all
that
can
be
say
against
the
french
sublime
,
in
this
instance
of
it
,
be
this
:
  
t
hat
<EOS>
the
grandeur
be
MORE
in
the
word
,
and
LESS
in
the
thing
.
 
<EOS>
no
doubt
,
the
ocean
fill
the
mind
with
vast
idea
;
but
Paris
be
so
far
inland
<EOS>
,
it
be
not
likely
I
should
run
post
a
hundred
mile
out
of
it
,
to
try
the
experiment
;
 
the
parisian
barber
mean
nothing
.
     
<EOS>
the
pail
of
water
stand
beside
the
great
deep
,
make
,
certainly
,
but
a
sorry
figure
in
speech
;
 
but
,
'
twill
be
say
,
 
it
have
one
advantage
 
'
tis
in
the
next
room
,
and
the
truth
of
the
buckle
may
be
try
in
it
,
without
more
ado
,
in
a
single
moment
.
  
<EOS>
in
honest
truth
,
and
upon
a
more
candid
revision
of
the
matter
,
the
french
expression
profess
MORE
than
it
perform
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
see
the
precise
and
distinguish
mark
of
national
character
more
in
these
nonsensical
minutia
than
in
the
most
important
matter
of
state
;
where
great
man
of
all
nation
talk
and
stalk
so
much
alike
,
that
I
would
not
give
ninepence
to
choose
amongst
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
so
long
in
get
from
under
my
barber
's
hand
,
that
it
be
too
late
to
think
of
go
with
my
letter

that
night

but
when
a

out

his
reflection
turn
to
little
account
;
so
take
down
the
name
of
the
Hotel
de
Modene
,
where
I
lodge
,
I
walk
forth
without
any
determination

I
walk

Pray

<EOS>
most

Monsieur

<EOS>
I
have
give
a
cast
with
my
eye
into
half
a
dozen
shop

as
I
come
along

in
search
of
a
face
<EOS>
not
likely
to
be
disorder
by
such
an
interruption
:
 
till
at
last
,
this
,
hit
my
fancy
,
I
have
walk
in

<EOS>
She
be
work
a
pair
of
ruffle
,
as
she
sit
in
a
low
chair
,
on
the
far
side
of
the
shop
,
face
the
door
.
     
<EOS>
Tres
volontier
,
most
willingly
,
say
she
,
lay
her
work
down
upon
a
chair
next
her
,
and
rise
up
from
the
low
chair
she
be
sit
in
,
with
so
cheerful
a
movement
,
and
so
cheerful
a
look
,
that
have
I
be
lay
out
fifty
louis
d'or
with
her
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
say
 
"
this
woman
be
grateful

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
You
must
turn
,
Monsieur
,
say
she
,
go
with
me
to
the
door
of
the
shop
,
and
point
the
way
down
the
street
<EOS>
I
be
to
take
,
 
you
must
turn
first
to
your
left
hand
,
 
mais
prenez
garde
 
<EOS>
there
be
two
turn
;
and
be
so
good
as
to
take
the
second
 
then
go
down
a
little
way
<EOS>
and
you
will
see
a
church
:
 
<EOS>
and
,
when
you
be
past
it
,
give
yourself
the
trouble
to
turn
directly
to
the
right
,
and
that
will
lead
you
to
the
foot
of
the
Pont
Neuf
,
which
you
must
cross
 
and
there
any
one
will
do
himself
the
pleasure
to
show
you
.
     
<EOS>
She
repeat
her
instruction
three
time
over
to
me
,
with
the
same
goodnatur'd
<EOS>
patience
the
third
time
as
the
first
;
 
and
if
TONES
and
MANNERS
have
a
meaning
,
which
certainly
they
have
,
<EOS>
unless
to
heart
which
shut
them
out
,
 
she
seem
really
interested
that
I
should
not
lose
myself
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
suppose
it
be
the
woman
's
beauty
,
notwithstanding
<EOS>
she
be
the
handsome
grisette
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
I
ever
see
,
which
have
much
to
do
with
the
sense
I
have
of
her
courtesy
;
only
I
remember
,
when
I
tell
her
how
much
I
be
oblige
to
her
,
that
I
look
very
full
in
her
eye
,
 
and
that
I
repeat
my
thank
as
often
as
she
have
do
her
instruction
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
get
ten
pace
from
the
door
,
before
I
find
I
have
forget
every
tittle
of
what
she
have
say
;
 
so
look
back
,
and
see
her
still
stand
in
the
door
of
the
shop
,
as
if
to
look
whether
I
go
right
or
not
,
 
I
return
back
to
ask
her
,
whether
the
first
turn
be
to
my
right
or
leave
,
 
for
that
I
have
absolutely
forget
.
  
<EOS>
be
it
possible
!
<EOS>
say
she
,
half
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
very
possible
,
reply
I
,
when
a
man
be
think
more
of
a
woman
than
of
her
good
advice
.
  
<EOS>
as
this
be
the
real
truth
 
<EOS>
she
take
it
,
as
every
woman
take
a
matter
of
right
,
with
a
slight
curtsey
.
     
<EOS>
Attendez
!
<EOS>
say
she
,
lay
her
hand
upon
my
arm
to
detain
me
,
whilst
she
call
a
lad
out
of
the
back
shop
to
get
ready
a
parcel
of
glove
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
just
go
to
send
him
,
say
she
,
with
a
packet
into
that
quarter
,
and
if
you
will
have
the
complaisance
to
step
in
,
it
will
be
ready
in
a
moment
,
and
he
shall
attend
you
to
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
walk'd
in
with
her
to
the
far
side
of
the
shop
:
 
and
take
up
the
ruffle
in
my
hand
which
she
lay
upon
the
chair
,
as
if
I
have
a
mind
to
sit
,
she
sit
down
herself
in
her
low
chair
,
and
I
instantly
sit
myself
down
beside
her
.
     
<EOS>
He
will
be
ready
,
Monsieur
,
say
she
,
in
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
that
moment
,
reply
I
,
most
willingly
would
I
say
something
very
civil
to
you
for
all
these
courtesy
.
 
<EOS>
any
one
may
do
a
casual
act
of
good
nature
,
but
a
continuation
of
them
show
it
be
a
part
of
the
temperature
;
and
certainly
,
add
I
,
if
it
be
the
same
blood
which
come
from
the
heart
which
descend
to
the
extreme
(
touch
her
wrist
)
<EOS>
I
be
sure
you
must
have
one
of
the
good
pulse
of
any
woman
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
feel
it
,
say
she
,
hold
out
her
arm
.
 
<EOS>
so
lay
down
my
hat
,
I
take
hold
of
her
finger
in
one
hand
,
and
apply
the
two
forefinger
of
my
other
to
the
artery

<EOS>
Would

<EOS>
my

<EOS>
how
wouldst
thou
have
laugh'd
and
moralize
upon

thou

<EOS>
trust

my

I

Monsieur
be
so
good
,
quoth
<EOS>
she
,
as
he
pass'd
by
us
,
as
to
give
himself
the
trouble
of
feel
my
pulse
.
 
<EOS>
the
husband
take
off
his
hat
,
and
make
me
a
bow
,
say
,
I
do
him
too
much
honour
 
and
have
say
that
,
he
put
on
his
hat
and
walk'd
out
.
  
<EOS>
Good
God
!
<EOS>
say
I
to
myself
,
as
he
go
out
,
 
and
can
this
man
be
the
husband
of
this
woman
!
  
<EOS>
let
it
not
torment
the
few
who
know
what
must
have
be
the
ground
of
this
exclamation
,
if
I
explain
it
to
those
who
do
not
.
  
<EOS>
in
London
a
shopkeeper
and
a
shopkeeper
's
wife
seem
to
be
one
bone
and
one
flesh
:
 
in
the
several
endowment
of
mind
and
body
,
sometimes
the
one
,
sometimes
the
other
have
it
,
so
as
,
in
general
,
to
be
upon
a
par
,
and
totally
with
each
other
as
nearly
as
man
and
wife
need
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
in
Paris
,
there
be
scarce
two
order
of
being
more
different
:
for
the
legislative
and
executive
power
of
the
shop
not
rest
in
the
husband
,
he
seldom
come
there
:
  
<EOS>
i
n
<EOS>
some
dark
and
dismal
room
behind
,
he
sit
commerce
-
less
,
in
his
thrum
nightcap
,
the
same
rough
son
of
Nature
that
Nature
leave
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
genius
of
a
people
,
where
nothing
but
the
monarchy
be
salique
,
have
cede
this
department
,
with
sundry
other
,
totally
to
the
woman
,
 
by
a
continual
higgling
with
customer
of
all
rank
and
size
from
morning
to
night
,
like
so
many
rough
pebble
shake
long
together
in
a
bag
,
by
amicable
collision
they
have
wear
down
their
asperity
and
sharp
angle
,
and
not
only
become
round
and
smooth
,
but
will
receive
,
some
of
them
,
a
polish
like
a
brilliant
:
   
<EOS>
Monsieur
le
Mari
be
little
well
than
the
stone
under
your
foot
.
     
<EOS>
surely
,
 
surely
,
man
!
<EOS>
it
be
not
good
for
thee
to
sit
alone
:
   
thou
wast
make
for
social
intercourse
and
gentle
greeting
;
and
this
improvement
of
our
nature
from
it
<EOS>
I
appeal
to
as
my
evidence
.
     
<EOS>
and
how
do
it
beat
,
Monsieur
?
<EOS>
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
with
all
the
benignity
,
say
I
,
look
quietly
in
her
eye
,
that
I
expect
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
go
to
say
something
civil
in
return
 
<EOS>
but
the
lad
come
into
the
shop
with
the
glove
.
 
<EOS>
a
propos
<EOS>
,
say
I
,
I
want
a
couple
of
pair
myself
.
  
<EOS>
the
GLOVES
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
the
beautiful
grisette
rise
up
when
I
say
this
,
and
go
behind
the
counter
,
reach'd
down
a
parcel
and
untie
it
:
 
<EOS>
I
advance
to
the
side
over
against
her
:
 
<EOS>
they
be
all
too
large
.
 
<EOS>
the
beautiful
grisette
measure
them
one
by
one
across
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
not
alter
their
dimension
.
 
<EOS>
She
begg'd
<EOS>
I
would
try
a
single
pair
,
which
seem
to
be
the
least
.
 
<EOS>
She
hold
it
open
;
 
my
hand
slip
into
it
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
not
do
,
say
I
,
shake
my
head
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
say
she
,
do
the
same
thing
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
certain
combine
look
of
simple
subtlety
,
 
where
whim
,
and
sense
,
and
seriousness
,
and
nonsense
,
be
so
blended
,
that
all
the
language
of
Babel
set
loose
together
,
could
not
express
them
;
  
-they
be
communicate
and
catch
so
instantaneously
,
<EOS>
that
you
can
scarce
say
which
party
be
the
infector
.
 
<EOS>
I
leave
it
to
your
man
of
word
to
swell
page
about
it
 
<EOS>
it
be
enough
in
the
present
to
say
again
,
the
glove
would
not
do
;
so
,
fold
our
hand
within
our
arm
<EOS>
,
we
both
loll
upon
the
counter
 
<EOS>
it
be
narrow
,
and
there
be
just
room
for
the
parcel
to
lay
between
us
.
  
<EOS>
the
beautiful
grisette
look
sometimes
at
the
glove
,
then
sideway
to
the
window
,
then
at
the
glove
,
 
and
then
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
not
disposed
to
break
silence
:
  
<EOS>
I
 
follow
her
example
:
 
<EOS>
so
,
I
look
at
the
glove
,
then
to
the
window
,
then
at
the
glove
,
and
then
at
her
,
 
and
so
on
alternately
.
  
<EOS>
I
find
I
lose
considerably
in
every
attack
:
  
<EOS>
s
he
have
a
quick
black
eye
,
and
shoot
through
two
such
long
and
silken
eyelash
with
such
penetration
,
that
she
look'd
<EOS>
into
my
very
heart
and
rein
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
seem
strange
,
but
I
could
actually
feel
she
do
.
     
<EOS>
It
be
no
matter
,
say
I
,
take
up
a
couple
of
the
pair
next
me
,
and
put
them
into
my
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
sensible
the
beautiful
grisette
have
not
ask
above
a
single
livre
above
the
price
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
wish'd
she
have
ask
a
livre
more
,
and
be
puzzle
my
brain
how
to
bring
the
matter
about
.
 
<EOS>
do
you
think
,
my
dear
Sir
,
say
she
,
mistake
my
embarrassment
,
that
I
could
ask
a
sous
too
much
of
a
stranger
 
and
of
a
stranger
whose
politeness
,
more
than
his
want
of
glove
,
have
do
me
the
honour
to
lay
himself
at
my
mercy
?
 
<EOS>
m'en
croyez
capable
?
 
<EOS>
faith
!
<EOS>
not
I
,
say
I
;
and
if
you
be
,
you
be
welcome
.
 
<EOS>
so
count
the
money
into
her
hand
,
and
with
a
low
bow
than
one
generally
make
to
a
shopkeeper
's
wife
,
I
go
out
,
and
her
lad
with
his
parcel
follow
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
translation
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
nobody
in
the
box
I
be
let
into
but
a
kindly
old
french
officer
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
the
character
,
not
only
because
I
honour
the
man
whose
manner
be
soften
by
a
profession
which
make
bad
man
bad
;
but
that
I
once
know
one
,
 
for
he
be
no
more
,
 
and
why
should
I
not
rescue
one
page
from
violation
by
write
his
name
in
it
,
and
tell
the
world
it
be
Captain
Tobias
Shandy
,
the
dear
of
my
flock
and
friend
,
whose
philanthropy
I
never
think
of
at
this
long
distance
from
his
death
 
<EOS>
but
my
eye
gush
out
with
tear
.
<EOS>
for
his
sake
I
have
a
predilection
for
the
whole
corps
of
veteran
;
and
so
I
strode
over
the
two
back
row
of
bench
and
place
myself
beside
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
officer
be
read
attentively
a
small
pamphlet
,
it
may
be
the
book
of
the
opera
,
with
a
large
pair
of
spectacle
.
 
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
sit
down
,
he
take
his
spectacle
off
,
and
put
them
into
a
shagreen
case
,
return'd
them
and
the
book
into
his
pocket
together
.
<EOS>
I
half
rise
up
,
and
make
him
a
bow
.
  
<EOS>
translate
this
into
any
civilized
language
in
the
world
 
<EOS>
the
sense
be
this
:
  
<EOS>
"
here
be
a
poor
stranger
come
into
the
box
 
<EOS>
he
seem
as
if
he
know
nobody
;
and
be
never
likely
,
be
he
to
be
seven
year
in
Paris
,
if
every
man
he
come
near
keep
his
spectacle
upon
his
nose
:
  
'
tis
shut
the
door
of
conversation
absolutely
in
his
face
 
and
use
him
bad
than
a
German
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
french
officer
may
as
well
have
say
it
all
aloud
:
 
and
if
he
have
,
I
should
in
course
have
put
the
bow
I
make
him
into
French
too
,
and
tell
him
,
"
I
be
sensible
of
his
attention
,
and
return'd
him
a
thousand
thank
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
not
a
secret
so
aid
to
the
progress
of
sociality
,
as
to
get
master
of
this
short
HAND
,
and
to
be
quick
in
render
the
several
turn
of
look
and
limb
with
all
their
inflection
and
delineation
,
into
plain
word
.
 
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
by
long
habitude
,
I
do
it
so
mechanically
,
that
,
when
I
walk
the
street
of
London
,
I
go
translate
all
the
way
;
and
have
more
than
once
stand
behind
in
the
circle
,
where
not
three
word
have
be
say
,
and
have
bring
off
twenty
different
dialogue
with
me
,
which
I
could
have
fairly
write
down
and
swear
to
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
go
one
evening
to
Martini
's
concert
at
Milan
,
and
,
be
just
enter
the
door
of
the
hall
,
when
the
Marquisina
di
F
#
#
#
#
be
come
out
in
a
sort
of
a
hurry
:
  
<EOS>
s
he
be
almost
upon
me
before
I
see
her
;
so
I
give
a
spring
to
once
side
to
let
her
pass
.
 
<EOS>
She
have
do
the
same
,
and
on
the
same
side
too
;
so
we
run
our
head
together
:
 
<EOS>
she
instantly
get
to
the
other
side
to
get
out
:
 
<EOS>
I
be
just
as
unfortunate
as
she
have
be
,
for
I
have
spring
to
that
side
,
and
oppose
her
passage
again
.
 
<EOS>
We
both
fly
together
to
the
other
side
,
and
then
back
,
 
and
so
on
:
  
<EOS>
i
t
be
ridiculous
:
 
we
both
<EOS>
blush'd
<EOS>
intolerably
:
 
so
I
do
at
last
the
thing
I
should
have
do
at
first
;
 
I
stand
stock
-
still
,
and
the
Marquisina
have
no
more
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
power
to
go
into
the
room
,
till
I
have
make
her
so
much
reparation
as
to
wait
and
follow
her
with
my
eye
to
the
end
of
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
She
look'd
back
twice
,
<EOS>
and
walk'd
<EOS>
along
it
rather
sideways
,
as
if
she
would
make
room
for
any
one
come
up
stair
to
pass
her
.
 
<EOS>
no
,
say
I
 
<EOS>
that
be
a
vile
translation
:
 
<EOS>
the
Marquisina
have
a
right
to
the
good
apology
I
can
make
her
,
and
that
opening
be
leave
for
me
to
do
it
in
;
 
so
I
run
and
<EOS>
begg'd
pardon
for
the
embarrassment
I
have
give
her
,
say
it
be
my
intention
to
have
make
her
way
.
 
<EOS>
She
answer
,
she
be
guide
by
the
same
intention
towards
me
;
 
<EOS>
so
we
reciprocally
thank'd
<EOS>
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
at
the
top
of
the
stair
;
and
see
no
cicisbeo
near
her
,
I
begg'd
to
hand
her
to
her
coach
;
 
<EOS>
so
we
go
down
the
stair
,
stop
at
every
third
step
to
talk
of
the
concert
and
the
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
upon
my
word
,
Madame
,
say
I
,
when
I
have
hand
her
in
,
I
make
six
different
effort
to
let
you
go
out
.
 
<EOS>
and
I
make
six
effort
,
reply
she
,
to
let
you
enter
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
to
heaven
you
would
make
a
seventh
,
say
I.
 
with
all
my
heart
,
say
she
,
make
room
.
  
<EOS>
-life
be
too
short
to
be
long
about
the
form
of
it
,
 
so
I
instantly
stepp'd
<EOS>
in
,
and
she
carry
me
home
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
and
what
become
of
the
concert
,
St.
Cecilia
,
who
I
suppose
be
at
it
,
know
more
than
I.
  
<EOS>
I
will
only
add
,
that
the
connexion
which
arise
out
of
the
translation
give
me
more
pleasure
than
any
one
I
have
the
honour
to
make
in
Italy
.
  
<EOS>
the
DWARF
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
never
hear
the
remark
make
by
any
one
in
my
life
,
except
by
one
;
and
who
that
be
will
probably
come
out
in
this
chapter
;
so
that
be
pretty
much
unprepossessed
,
there
must
have
be
ground
for
what
strike
me
the
moment
I
cast
my
eye
over
the
parterre
,
  
and
that
be
,
the
unaccountable
sport
of
Nature
in
form
such
number
of
dwarf
.
 
<EOS>
no
doubt
she
sport
at
certain
time
in
almost
every
corner
of
the
world
;
but
in
Paris
there
be
no
end
to
her
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
the
goddess
seem
almost
as
merry
as
she
be
wise
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
carry
my
idea
out
of
the
Opera
Comique
with
me
,
I
measure
every
body
I
see
walk
in
the
street
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
melancholy
application
!
<EOS>
especially
where
the
size
be
extremely
little
,
 
the
face
extremely
dark
,
 
the
eye
quick
,
 
the
nose
long
,
 
the
tooth
white
,
 
the
jaw
prominent
,
 
to
see
so
many
miserable
,
by
force
of
accident
drive
out
of
their
own
proper
class
into
the
very
verge
of
another
,
which
it
give
me
pain
to
write
down
:
  
<EOS>
e
very
third
man
a
pigmy
!
 
<EOS>
some
by
rickety
head
and
hump
back
;
 
other
by
bandy
leg
;
 
<EOS>
a
third
set
arrest
by
the
hand
of
Nature
in
the
sixth
and
seventh
year
of
their
growth
;
 
a
fourth
,
in
their
perfect
and
natural
state
like
dwarf
apple
tree
;
from
the
first
rudiment
and
stamina
of
their
existence
,
never
mean
to
grow
high
.
  
<EOS>
a
Medical
Traveller
may
say
,
'
tis
owe
to
undue
bandage
;
 
a
Splenetic
one
,
to
want
of
air
;
 
and
an
Inquisitive
Traveller
,
to
fortify
the
system
,
may
measure
the
height
of
their
house
,
 
the
narrowness
of
their
street
,
and
in
how
few
foot
square
in
the
sixth
and
seventh
story
such
number
of
the
bourgeoisie
eat
and
sleep
together
;
but
I
remember
Mr.
Shandy
the
elder
,
who
account
for
nothing
like
any
body
else
,
in
speak
one
evening
of
these
matter
,
aver
that
child
,
like
other
animal
,
may
be
increase
almost
to
any
size
,
provide
they
come
right
into
the
world
;
but
the
misery
be
,
the
citizen
of
be
Paris
<EOS>
so
coop'd
up
,
that
they
have
not
actually
room
enough
to
get
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
call
it
get
anything
,
say
he
;
 
'
tis
get
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
continue
he
,
rise
in
his
argument
,
'
tis
get
bad

nothing

when
all
you
have
get
after
twenty
or
five
and
twenty
year
of
the
tender
care
and
most
nutritious
aliment
bestow
upon
it
,
shall
not
at
last
be
as
high
as
my
leg
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
Mr.
Shandy
be
very
short
,
there
could
be
nothing
more
say
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
as
this
be
not
a
work
of
reasoning
,
I
leave
the
solution
as
I
find
it
,
and
content
myself
with
the
truth
only
of
the
remark
,
which
be
verify
in
every
lane
and
by
-
lane
of
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
walk
down
that
which
lead
from
the
Carousal
to
the
Palais
Royal
,
and
observe
a
little
boy
in
some
distress
at
the
side
of
the
gutter
which
run
down
the
middle
of
it
<EOS>
,
I
take
hold
of
his
hand
and
help'd
him
over
.
 
<EOS>
upon
turn
up
his
face
to
look
at
him
after
,
I
perceive
he
be
about
forty
.
 
<EOS>
never
mind
,
say
I
,
some
good
body
will
do
as
much
for
me
when
I
be
ninety
.
  
<EOS>
I
feel
some
little
principle
within
me
which
incline
me
to
be
merciful
towards
this
poor
blighted
part
of
my
specie
,
who
have
neither
size
nor
strength
to
get
on
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
to
see
one
of
them
tread
upon
;
and
have
scarce
get
seat
beside
my
old
french
officer
,
ere
<EOS>
the
disgust
be
exercise
,
by
see
the
very
thing
happen
under
the
box
we
sit
in
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
the
orchestra
,
and
betwixt
that
and
the
first
side
box
,
there
be
a
small
esplanade
leave
,
where
,
when
the
house
be
full
,
number
of
all
rank
take
sanctuary
.
 
<EOS>
though
you
stand
,
as
in
the
parterre
,
you
pay
the
same
price
as
in
the
orchestra
.
 
<EOS>
a
poor
defenceless
being
of
this
order
have
get
thrust
somehow
or
other
into
this
luckless
place
;
 
the
night
be
hot
,
and
he
be
surround
by
being
two
foot
and
a
half
high
than
himself
.
 
<EOS>
the
dwarf
suffer
inexpressibly
on
all
side
;
but
the
thing
which
incommode
him
most
,
be
a
tall
corpulent
german
,
near
seven
foot
high
,
who
stand
directly
betwixt
him
and
all
possibility
of
his
see
either
the
stage
or
the
actor
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
dwarf
do
all
he
could
to
get
a
peep
at
what
be
go
forwards
,
by
seek
for
some
little
opening
betwixt
the
German
's
arm
and
his
body
,
try
first
on
one
side
,
then
the
other
;
but
the
German
stand
square
in
the
most
unaccommodating
posture
that
can
be
imagine
:
  
<EOS>
t
he
dwarf
may
as
well
have
be
place
at
the
bottom
of
the
deep
draw
-
well
in
Paris
;
so
he
civilly
reach
up
his
hand
to
the
German
's
sleeve
,
and
tell
him
his
distress
.
 
<EOS>
the
german
turn'd
<EOS>
his
head
back
,
look
down
upon
him
as
Goliah
do
upon
David
,
 
and
unfeelingly
resume
his
posture
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
just
then
take
a
pinch
of
snuff
out
of
my
monk
's
little
horn
box
.
 
<EOS>
and
how
would
thy
meek
and
courteous
spirit
,
<EOS>
my
dear
monk
!
<EOS>
so
temper'd
to
BEAR
and
FORBEAR
!
 
<EOS>
how
sweetly
would
it
have
lend
an
ear
to
this
poor
soul
's
complaint
!
  
<EOS>
the
old
french
officer
,
see
me
lift
up
my
eye
with
an
emotion
,
as
I
make
the
apostrophe
,
take
the
liberty
to
ask
me
what
be
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
the
story
in
three
word
;
and
add
,
how
inhuman
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
dwarf
be
drive
to
extreme
,
and
in
his
first
transport
,
which
be
generally
unreasonable
,
have
tell
the
german
he
would
cut
off
his
long
queue
with
his
knife
.
 
<EOS>
the
German
look'd
<EOS>
back
coolly
,
and
tell
him
he
be
welcome
,
if
he
could
reach
it
.
  
<EOS>
an
injury
sharpen'd
by
an
insult
,
be
it
to
whom
it
will
,
make
every
man
of
sentiment
a
party
:
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
leap'd
out
of
the
box
to
have
redress
it
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
french
officer
do
it
with
much
less
confusion
;
for
lean
a
little
over
,
and
nod
to
a
sentinel
,
and
point
at
the
same
time
with
his
finger
at
the
distress
,
 
the
sentinel
make
his
way
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
occasion
to
tell
the
grievance
,
 
the
thing
tell
himself
;
so
thrust
back
the
German
instantly
with
his
musket
,
 
he
take
the
poor
dwarf
by
the
hand
,
and
place
him
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
noble
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
clap
my
hand
together
.
 
<EOS>
and
yet
you
would
not
permit
this
,
say
the
old
officer
,
in
England
.
     
<EOS>
in
England
,
dear
Sir
,
say
I
,
we
sit
all
<EOS>
at
our
EASE
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
french
officer
would
have
set
me
at
unity
with
myself
,
in
case
<EOS>
I
have
be
at
variance
,
 
by
say
it
be
a
bon
mot
;
 
and
,
as
a
bon
mot
be
always
worth
something
at
Paris
,
he
offer
me
a
pinch
of
snuff
.
  
<EOS>
the
ROSE
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
now
my
turn
to
ask
the
old
french
officer
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
for
a
cry
of
"
Haussez
les
main
,
Monsieur
l'abbe
!
<EOS>
"
re
-
echo
from
a
dozen
different
part
of
the
parterre
,
be
as
unintelligible
to
me
,
as
my
apostrophe
to
the
monk
have
be
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
it
be
some
poor
Abbe
in
one
of
the
upper
loge
,
who
,
he
suppose
,
have
get
plant
perdu
behind
a
couple
of
grisette
in
order
to
see
the
opera
,
and
that
the
parterre
espy
him
,
be
insist
upon
his
hold
up
both
his
hand
during
the
representation
.
 
<EOS>
and
can
it
be
suppose
,
say
I
,
that
an
ecclesiastic
would
pick
the
grisette
'
pocket
?
 
<EOS>
the
old
french
officer
smile
,
and
whisper
in
my
ear
,
open
a
door
of
knowledge
which
I
have
no
idea
of
.
  
<EOS>
Good
God
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
turn
pale
with
astonishment
 
be
it
possible
,
that
a
people
so
smit
with
sentiment
should
at
the
same
time
be
so
unclean
,
and
<EOS>
so
unlike
themselves
,
 
Quelle
grossierte
!
<EOS>
add
I.
  
<EOS>
the
french
officer
tell
me
,
it
be
an
illiberal
sarcasm
at
the
church
,
which
have
begin
in
the
theatre
about
the
time
the
Tartuffe
be
give
in
it
by
Moliere
:
 
but
like
other
remain
of
gothic
manner
,
be
decline
.
 
<EOS>
every
nation
,
continue
he
,
have
their
refinement
and
grossierte
,
in
which
they
take
the
lead
,
and
lose
it
of
one
another
by
turn
:
  
t
hat
he
have
be
in
most
country
,
but
never
in
one
where
he
find
not
some
delicacy
,
which
other
seem
to
want
.
 
<EOS>
Le
POUR
et
le
CONTRE
<EOS>
se
trouvent
en
chaque
nation
;
there
be
a
balance
,
say
he
,
of
good
and
bad
everywhere
;
and
nothing
but
the
knowing
it
be
so
,
can
emancipate
one
half
of
the
world
from
the
prepossession
which
it
hold
against
the
other
:
   
that
the
advantage
of
travel
,
as
it
regard
the
scavoir

,
be
by
see
a
great
deal
both
of
man
and
manner

it
teach
us
mutual
toleration
;
and
mutual
toleration
,
conclude
he
,
make
me
a
bow
,
teach
us
mutual
love
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
french
officer
deliver
this
with
an
air
of
such
candour
and
good
sense
,
as
coincide
with
my
first
favourable
impression
of
his
character
:
  
<EOS>
I
 
think
I
love
the
man
;
but
<EOS>
I
fear
I
mistake
the
object
;
 
'
twas
my
own
way
of
thinking
 
the
difference
be
,
I
could
not
have
express
it
half
so
well
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
alike
troublesome
to
both
the
rider
and
his
beast
,
 
if
the
latter
go
prick
up
his
ear
,
and
start
all
the
way
at
every
object
which
he
never
see
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
as
little
torment
of
this
kind
as
any
creature
alive
;
<EOS>
and
yet
I
honestly
confess
,
that
many
a
thing
give
me
pain
,
and
that
I
blush'd
<EOS>
at
many
a
word
the
first
month
,
 
which
I
find
inconsequent
and
perfectly
innocent
the
second

You

that

to
oblige
an
Englishman
to
lay
out
a

your

<EOS>
the

make
a

go

something

when
a
young
decent
girl
about
twenty

who
by
her
air
and

to
be
fille

to
some
devout

come
into

ask
for
Les

the

give
her
the
book
directly
;
she

out
a

green
satin
purse
run
round
with
a

and
put
her

into

she
take
out
the
money

for
it

<EOS>
as
I

me
in

we

walk'd
out

<EOS>
and
what
have
you
to
do
,
my

say
I
,
with
the
wandering
of
the
Heart
,
who
scarce
know

you

one

nor

till

Le

the

hold
her
satin
purse

<EOS>
'
Tis

<EOS>
she

it
towards
me
 
<EOS>
and
there
be
very
little
in

my

I

but
be
but
as
good
as
thou
art
handsome

and
heaven
will
fill
it

<EOS>
I
have
a
parcel
of
crown
in
my
hand
to

for
Shakespeare

,
as
she
have
let
go
the

entirely

I
put
a
single
one
in

tie
up
the
riband

knot

return
it

the

me
more

thankful
sinking

where
the

bow
itself
down

<EOS>

<EOS>
I
never
give
a
girl
a
crown
in
my
life
which
give
me
half
the
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
My
advice
,
my
dear

would
not
have
be
worth
a
pin
to
you
,
say
I
,
if
I
have
not
give
this
along
with
it
:
 
but
now
,
when
you
see
the
crown
,
you
will
remember
it
;
 
so
do
not
,
my
dear
,
lie
it
out
in
riband
.
  
<EOS>
upon
my
word
,
Sir
,
say
the
girl
,
earnestly
,
I
be
incapable
;
 
in
say
which
,
as
be
usual
in
little
bargain
of
honour
,
she
give
me
her
hand
:
  
e
n
verite
,
Monsieur
<EOS>
,
je
mettrai
cet
argent
apart
,
say
she
.
  
<EOS>
when
a
virtuous
convention
be
make
betwixt
man

woman

it
sanctify
their
most
private
walk

so
,
notwithstanding
it
be
dusky

yet
as
both
our
road
lie
the

we
make
no
scruple

walk
along
the
Quai

She
make
me
a
second
courtesy
in
set
off
,
and
before
we
get
twenty
yard
from
the
door

as
if
she

not

enough
before

she
make
a
sort
of
a
little
stop
to
tell
me
again
 
she
<EOS>
thank'd
<EOS>
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
small
tribute
,
I
tell
her
,
which
I
could
not
avoid
pay
to
virtue
,
and
would
not
be
mistake
in
the
person
I
have
be
render
it
to
for
the
world
;
 
but
I
see
innocence
,
my
dear
,
in
your
face
,
 
and
foul
befall
the
man
who
ever
lay
a
snare
in
its
way
!
  
<EOS>
the
girl
seem'd
affect
some
way
or
other
with
what
I
say
;
 
she
give
a
low
sigh
:
  
<EOS>
I
 
find
I
be
not
empower
to
enquire
at
all
after
it
,
 
so
say
nothing
more
till
I
get
to
the
corner
of
the
Rue
de
Nevers
,
where
,
we
be
to
part
.
     
<EOS>
but
be
this
the
way
,
my
dear
,
say
I
,
to
the
Hotel
de
Modene
?
<EOS>
She
tell
me
it
be
;
 
or
that
I
may
go
by
the
Rue
de
Gueneguault
,
which
be
the
next
turn
.
 
<EOS>
then
I
will
go
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
by
the
Rue
de
Gueneguault
,
say
I
,
for
two
reason
;
first
,
I
shall
please
myself
,
and
next
,
I
shall
give
you
the
protection
of
my
company
as
far
on
your
way
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
the
girl
be
sensible
I
be
civil
 
and
say
,
she
wish
the
Hotel
de
Modene
be
in
the
Rue
de
St.
Pierre
.
 
<EOS>
You
live
there
?
<EOS>
say
<EOS>
I.
 
She
tell
me
she
be
fille
de
chambre
to
Madame
R
#
#
#
#
.
 
<EOS>
Good
God
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
'
tis
the
very
lady
for
whom
I
have
bring
a
letter
from
Amiens
.
 
<EOS>
the
girl
tell
me
that
Madame
R
#
#
#
#
,
she
believe
,
expect
a
stranger
with
a
letter
,
and
be
impatient
to
see
him
:
   
<EOS>
so
I
desire
the
girl
to
present
my
compliment
to
Madame
R
#
#
#
#
,
and
say
,
I
would
certainly
wait
upon
her
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
We
stand
still
at
the
corner
of
the
Rue
de
Nevers
whilst
this
pass'd
.
 
<EOS>
We
then
stop
a
moment
whilst
she
dispose
of
her
Egarements
du
Coeur
&
c.
more
commodiously
than
carry
them
in
her
hand
 
they
be
two
volume
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
hold
the
second
for
her
whilst
she
put
the
first
into
her
pocket
;
and
then
she
hold
her
pocket
,
and
I
put
in
the
other
after
it
.
  
<EOS>
@@@ti
sweet
to
feel
by
what
fine
spin
thread
<EOS>
our
affection
be
draw
together
.
  
<EOS>
We
set
off
afresh
,
and
as
she
take
her
third
step
,
the
girl
put
her
hand
within
my
arm
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
just
bid
her
,
 
but
<EOS>
she
do
it
of
herself
,
with
that
undeliberating
simplicity
,
which
show'd
<EOS>
it
be
out
of
her
head
that
she
have
never
see
me
before
.
 
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
feel
the
conviction
of
consanguinity
so
strongly
,
that
I
could
not
help
turn
half
round
to
look
in
her
face
,
and
see
if
I
could
trace
out
any
thing
in
it
of
a
family
likeness
.
 
<EOS>
Tut
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
be
we
not
all
relation
?
  
<EOS>
when
we
arrive
at
the
turning
up
of
the
Rue
de
Gueneguault
,
I
stopp'd
<EOS>
to
bid
her
adieu
for
good
and
all
:
 
the
girl
would
thank
me
again
for
my
company
and
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
She
bid
me
adieu
twice
.
 
<EOS>
I
repeat
it
as
often
;
and
so
cordial
be
the
parting
between
us
,
that
have
it
happen
any
where
else
<EOS>
,
I
be
not
sure
<EOS>
but
I
should
have
sign
it
with
a
kiss
of
charity
,
as
warm
and
holy
as
an
apostle
.
  
<EOS>
but
in
Paris
,
as
none
kiss
each
other
but
the
man
,
 
I
do
,
what
amount
to
the
same
thing
        
I
bid
God
bless
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
passport
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
get
home
to
my
hotel
,
La
Fleur
tell
me
I
have
be
enquire
after
by
the
Lieutenant
de
Police
.
 
<EOS>
the
deuce
take
it
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
 
I
know
the
reason
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
time
the
reader
should
know
it
,
for
in
the
order
of
thing
in
which
it
happen
,
it
be
omit
:
 
not
that
it
be
out
of
my
head
;
but
that
have
I
tell
it
then
it
may
have
be
forget
now
;
 
and
now
be
the
time
I
want
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
leave
London
with
so
much
precipitation
,
<EOS>
that
it
never
enter'd
<EOS>
my
mind
that
we
be
at
war
with
France
;
and
have
reach
Dover
,
and
look
through
my
glass
at
the
hill
beyond
Boulogne
,
before
the
idea
present
itself
;
and
with
this
in
its
train
,
that
there
be
no
get
there
without
a
passport
.
 
<EOS>
go
<EOS>
but
to
the
end
of
a
street
,
I
have
a
mortal
aversion
for
return
back
no
wiser
than
I
set
out
;
and
as
this
be
one
of
the
great
effort
I
have
ever
make
for
knowledge
,
I
could
less
bear
the
thought
of
it
:
 
<EOS>
so
hear
the
Count
de
 
have
hire
the
packet
<EOS>
,
I
begg'd
<EOS>
he
would
take
me
in
his
suite
.
 
<EOS>
the
Count
have
some
little
knowledge
of
me
,
so
make
little
or
no
difficulty
,
 
only
say
,
his
inclination
to
serve
me
could
reach
no
farther
than
Calais
,
as
he
be
to
return
by
way
of
Brussels
to
Paris
;
however
,
when
I
have
once
pass'd
there
,
I
may
get
to
Paris
without
interruption
;
but
that
in
Paris
I
must
make
friend
and
shift
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
let
me
get
to
Paris
,
Monsieur
le
Count
,
say
I
,
 
<EOS>
and
I
shall
do
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
embark'd
,
and
never
think
more
of
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
when
La
Fleur
tell
me
the
Lieutenant
de
Police
have
be
enquire
after
me
,
 
the
thing
instantly
recur
;
 
and
by
the
time
La
Fleur
have
well
tell
me
,
the
master
of
the
hotel
come
into
my
room
to
tell
me
the
same
thing
,
with
this
addition
to
it
,
that
my
passport
have
be
particularly
ask
after
:
 
the
master
of
the
hotel
conclude
with
say
,
<EOS>
He
hope
I
have
one
.
 
<EOS>
not
I
,
faith
!
say
I.
  
<EOS>
the
master
of
the
hotel
retire
three
step
from
me
,
as
from
an
infected
person
,
as
I
declare
this
;
 
and
poor
La
Fleur
advance
three
step
towards
me
,
and
with
that
sort
of
movement
which
a
good
soul
make
to
succour
a
distress'd
one
:
  
<EOS>
t
he
fellow
win
my
heart
by
it
;
and
from
that
single
trait
I
know
his
character
as
perfectly
,
and
could
rely
upon
it
as
firmly
,
as
if
he
have
serve
me
with
fidelity
for
seven
year
.
  
<EOS>
mon
seigneur
!
<EOS>
cry
the
master
of
the
hotel
;
but
recollect
himself
as
he
make
the
exclamation
,
he
instantly
change
the
tone
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
if
Monsieur
,
say
he
,
have
not
a
passport
(
apparemment
)
in
all
likelihood
he
have
friend
in
Paris
who
can
procure
him
one
.
  
<EOS>
not
that
I
know
of
,
quoth
<EOS>
I
,
with
an
air
of
indifference
.
 
<EOS>
then
certe
,
reply
he
,
you
will
be
send
to
the
Bastile
or
the
Chatelet
au
moin
.
 
<EOS>
Poo
!
say
I
,
the
King
of
France
be
a
good
natur'd
soul
:
  
h
e'll
hurt
nobody
.
 
<EOS>
Cela
n'empeche

,
say
he
 
<EOS>
you
will
certainly
be
send
to
the
Bastile
to
-
morrow
morning
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
take
your
lodging
for
a
month
,
<EOS>
answer'd
I
,
and
I
will
not
quit
them
a
day
before
the
time
for
all
the
king
of
France
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
La
Fleur
whisper
in
my
ear
,
that
nobody
could
oppose
the
king
of
France
.
  
<EOS>
Pardi
!
<EOS>
say
my
host
,
ce
Messieurs
Anglois
sont
<EOS>
des
gen
tre
extraordinaire
;
 
and
,
have
both
say
and
swear
it
<EOS>
,
 
he
go
out
.
  
<EOS>
the
PASSPORT
.
 
<EOS>
the
hotel
at
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
find
in
my
heart
to
torture
La
Fleur
's
with
a
serious
look
upon
the
subject
of
my
embarrassment
,
which
be
the
reason
I
have
treat
it
so
cavalierly
:
 
and
to
show
him
how
light
it
lie
upon
my
mind
<EOS>
,
I
dropt
the
subject
entirely
;
and
whilst
he
wait
upon
me
at
supper
,
talk'd
<EOS>
to
him
with
more
than
usual
gaiety
about
Paris
,
and
of
the
Opera
Comique
.
 
<EOS>
La
Fleur
have
be
there
himself
,
and
have
follow
me
through
the
street
as
far
as
the
bookseller
's
shop
;
but
see
me
come
out
with
the
young
fille
de
chambre
,
and
that
we
walk'd
down
the
Quai
de
Conti
together
,
<EOS>
La
Fleur
<EOS>
deem'd
<EOS>
it
unnecessary
to
follow
me
a
step
further
;
 
so
make
his
own
reflection
upon
it
,
he
take
a
short
cut
,
 
and
get
to
the
hotel
in
time
to
be
inform'd
of
the
affair
of
the
police
against
my
arrival
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
honest
creature
have
take
away
,
and
go
down
to
sup
himself
,
I
then
begin
to
think
a
little
seriously
about
my
situation
.
        
<EOS>
and
here
,
I
know
,
Eugenius
,
thou
wilt
smile
at
the
remembrance
of
a
short
dialogue
which
pass
betwixt
us
the
moment
I
be
go
to
set
out
:
  
<EOS>
I
 
must
tell
it
here
.
  
<EOS>
Eugenius
,
<EOS>
know
that
I
be
as
little
subject
to
be
overburden'd
with
money
as
thought
,
have
draw
me
aside
to
interrogate
me
how
much
I
have
take
care
for
.
 
<EOS>
upon
tell
him
the
exact
sum
,
Eugenius
shake
his
head
,
and
say
it
would
not
do
;
so
pull'd
out
his
purse
in
order
to
empty
it
into
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
enough
in
conscience
,
Eugenius
,
say
I.
 
indeed
,
Yorick
,
you
have
not
,
reply
Eugenius
;
I
know
France
and
Italy
better
than
you
.
 
<EOS>
but
you
do
not
consider
,
Eugenius
,
say
I
,
refuse
his
offer
,
that
before
I
have
be
three
day
in
Paris
,
I
shall
take
care
to
say
or
do
something
or
other
for
which
I
shall
get
clapp'd
up
into
the
Bastile
,
and
that
I
shall
live
there
a
couple
of
month
entirely
at
the
king
of
France
's
expense
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
pardon
,
say
Eugenius
drily
:
<EOS>
really
I
have
forget
that
resource
.
  
<EOS>
now
the
event
I
treat
gaily
come
seriously
to
my
door
.
  
<EOS>
be
it
folly
,
or
nonchalance
,
or
philosophy
,
or
pertinacity
 
or
what
be
it
in
me
,
that
,
after
all
,
when
La
Fleur
have
go
down
stair
,
and
I
be
quite
alone
,
I
could
not
bring
down
my
mind
to
think
of
it
otherwise
than
I
have
then
speak
of
it
to
Eugenius
?
     
<EOS>
and
as
for
the
Bastile
;
the
terror
be
in
the
word
.
 
<EOS>
make
the
most
of
it
<EOS>
you
can
,
say
I
to
myself
,
the
Bastile
be
but
another
word
for
a
tower
;
 
and
a
tower
be
but
another
word
for
a
house
you
can
not
get
out
of
.
 
<EOS>
mercy
on
the
gouty
!
<EOS>
for
they
be
in
it
twice
a
year
.
  
<EOS>
but
with
nine
livre
a
day
,
and
pen
and
ink
,
and
paper
,
and
patience
,
albeit
a
man
can
not
get
out
,
he
may
do
very
well
within
,
  
at
least
for
a
mouth
or
six
week
;
at
the
end
of
which
,
if
he
be
a
harmless
fellow
,
his
innocence
appear
,
and
he
come
out
a
well
and
wise
man
than
he
go
in
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
some
occasion
(
I
forget
what
)
to
step
into
the
court
-
yard
,
as
I
settle
this
account
;
and
remember
I
walk'd
down
stair
in
no
small
triumph
with
the
conceit
of
my
reasoning
.
 
<EOS>
Beshrew
the
sombre
pencil
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
vauntingly
 
for
I
envy
not
its
power
,
which
paint
the
evil
of
life
with
so
hard
and
deadly
a
colouring
.
 
<EOS>
the
mind
sit
terrify
at
the
object
she
have
magnify
herself
,
and
blacken
:
 
<EOS>
reduce
them
to
their
proper
size
and
hue
,
she
overlook
them
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
true
,
say
I
,
correct
the
proposition
,
 
the
Bastile
be
not
an
evil
to
be
despise
;
 
but
strip
it
of
its
tower
 
<EOS>
fill
up
the
fosse
,
 
unbarricade
the
door
 
call
it
simply
a
confinement
,
and
suppose
'
tis
some
tyrant
of
a
distemper
 
and
not
of
a
man
,
which
hold
you
in
it
,
 
the
evil
vanishe
,
and
you
bear
the
other
half
without
complaint
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
interrupt
in
the
heyday
of
this
soliloquy
,
with
a
voice
which
I
take
to
be
of
a
child
,
which
complain
"
it
could
not
get
out
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
look'd
up
and
down
the
passage
,
and
see
neither
man
,
woman
,
nor
child
,
I
go
out
without
farth
attention
.
  
<EOS>
in
my
return
back
through
the
passage
,
I
hear
the
same
word
repeat
twice
over
;
and
,
look
up
,
I
see
it
be
a
starling
hung
in
a
little
cage
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
get
out
,
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
get
out
,
"
say
the
starling
.
  
<EOS>
I
stand
look
at
the
bird
:
 
and
to
every
person
who
come
through
the
passage
it
run
flutter
to
the
side
towards
which
<EOS>
they
<EOS>
approach'd
it
,
with
the
same
lamentation
of
its
captivity
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
get
out
,
"
say
the
starling
.
 
<EOS>
God
help
thee
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
but
I
will
let
thee
out
,
cost
what
it
will
;
so
I
turn
about
the
cage
to
get
to
the
door
:
 
it
be
twist
and
double
twist
so
fast
with
wire
<EOS>
,
there
be
no
get
it
open
without
pull

<EOS>
the
CAPTIVE
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
the
bird
in
his
cage
pursue
me
into
my
room
;
I
sit
down
close
to
my
table
,
and
lean
my
head
upon
my
hand
,
I
begin
to
figure
to
myself
the
misery
of
confinement
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
a
right
frame
for
it
,
and
so
I
give
full
scope
to
my
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
begin
with
the
million
of
my
fellow
-
creature
bear
to
no
inheritance
but
slavery
:
 
but
find
,
however
affect
the
picture
be
,
that
I
could
not
bring
it
near
me
,
and
that
the
multitude
of
sad
group
in
it
do
but
distract
me
.
        
<EOS>
I
take
a
single
captive
,
and
have
first
shut
him
up
in
his
dungeon
,
I
then
look'd
<EOS>
through
the
twilight
of
his
grate
door
to
take
his
picture
.
  
<EOS>
I
beheld
his
body
half
-
waste
away
with
long
expectation
and
confinement
,
and
feel
what
kind
of
sickness
of
the
heart
it
be
which
arise
from
hope
<EOS>
deferr'd
.
 
<EOS>
upon
look
nearer
I
see
him
pale
and
feverish
:
 
<EOS>
in
thirty
year
the
western
breeze
have
not
once
fann'd
<EOS>
his
blood
;
 
<EOS>
he
have
see
no
sun
,
no
moon
,
in
all
that
time
 
nor
have
the
voice
of
friend
or
kinsman
breathe
through
his
lattice
.
 
<EOS>
His
child
     
<EOS>
but
here
my
heart
begin
to
bleed
 
<EOS>
and
I
be
force
to
go
on
with
another
part
of
the
portrait
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
sit
upon
the
ground
upon
a
little
straw
,
in
the
furth
corner
of
his
dungeon
,
which
be
alternately
his
chair
and
bed
:
 
a
little
calendar
of
small
stick
be
lay
at
the
head
,
notch'd
all
over
with
the
dismal
day
and
night
he
have
pass
there
;
 
<EOS>
he
have
one
of
these
little
stick
in
his
hand
,
and
,
with
a
rusty
nail
he
be
etch
another
day
of
misery
to
add
to
the
heap
.
 
<EOS>
as
I
darken
the
little
light
he
have
,
he
lift
up
a
hopeless
eye
towards
the
door
,
then
cast
it
down
,
 
shake
his
head
,
and
go
on
with
his
work
of
affliction
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
his
chain
upon
his
leg
,
as
he
turn
his
body
to
lay
his
little
stick
upon
the
bundle
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
a
deep
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
iron
enter
into
his
soul
!
 
<EOS>
I
burst
into
tear
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
sustain
the
picture
of
confinement
which
my
fancy
have
draw
.
 
<EOS>
I
start
up
from
my
chair
,
and
call
La
Fleur
:
 
<EOS>
I
bid
him
bespeak
me
a
remise
,
and
have
it
ready
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
by
nine
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
go
directly
,
say
I
,
myself
to
Monsieur
le
Duc
de
Choiseul
.
  
<EOS>
La
Fleur
would
have
put
me
to
bed
;
but
 
not
willing
he
should
see
anything
upon
my
cheek
which
would
cost
the
honest
fellow
a
heart
-
ache
,
 
<EOS>
I
tell
him
I
would
go
to
bed
by
myself
,
 
and
bid
him
go
<EOS>
do
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
the
starling
.
 
<EOS>
road
to
VERSAILLES
.
  
<EOS>
I
get
into
my
remise
the
hour
I
propose
:
 
<EOS>
La
Fleur
get
up
behind
,
and
I
bid
the
coachman
make
the
good
of
his
way
to
Versailles
.
  
<EOS>
as
there
be
nothing
in
this
road
,
or
rather
nothing
which
I
look
for
in
travel
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
fill
up
the
blank
better
than
with
a
short
history
of
this
self
-
same
bird
,
which
become
the
subject
of
the
last
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
whilst
<EOS>
the
honourable
<EOS>
Mr.
 
be
wait
for
a
wind
at
Dover
,
it
have
be
catch
upon
the
cliff
,
before
it
could
well
fly
,
by
an
english
lad
who
be
his
groom
;
who
,
not
care
to
destroy
it
,
have
take
it
in
his
breast
into
the
packet
;
 
and
,
by
course
of
feed
it
,
and
take
it
once
under
his
protection
,
in
a
day
or
two
grow
fond
of
it
,
and
get
it
safe
along
with
him
to
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
at
Paris
the
lad
have
lay
out
a
livre
in
a
little
cage
for
the
starling
,
and
as
he
have
little
to
do
well
the
five
month
his
master
staid
there
,
he
teach
it
,
in
his
mother
's
tongue
,
the
four
simple
word
(
and
no
more
)
 
to
which
I
own'd
myself
so
much
its
debtor
.
  
<EOS>
upon
his
master
be
go
on
for
Italy
,
the
lad
have
give
it
to
the
master
of
the
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
little
song
for
liberty
be
in
an
unknown
language
at
Paris
,
the
bird
have
little
or
no
store
set
by
him
:
 
<EOS>
so
La
Fleur
buy
both
him
and
his
cage
for
me
for
a
bottle
of
Burgundy
.
  
<EOS>
in
my
return
from
Italy
I
bring
him
with
me
to
the
country
in
whose
language
he
have
learn
his
note
;
and
tell
the
story
of
him
to
Lord
a
#
#
#
#
,
Lord
a
#
#
#
#
begg'd
the
bird
of
me
;
 
in
a
week
Lord
a
#
#
#
#
give
him
to
Lord
B
#
#
#
#
;
Lord
B
#
#
#
#
make
a
present
of
him
to
Lord
C
#
#
#
#
;
and
Lord
C
#
#
#
#
's
gentleman
sell
him
to
Lord
D
#
#
#
#
be
for
a
shilling
;
Lord
D
#
#
#
#
give
him
to
Lord
E
#
#
#
#
;
and
so
on
 
half
round
the
alphabet
.
 
<EOS>
from
that
rank
he
pass'd
into
the
low
house
,
and
pass'd
the
hand
of
as
many
commoner
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
all
these
want
to
get
in
,
and
my
bird
want
to
get
out
,
he
have
almost
as
little
store
set
by
him
in
London
as
in
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
but
many
of
my
reader
must
have
hear
of
him
;
and
if
any
by
mere
chance
have
ever
see
him
,
I
beg
leave
to
inform
them
,
that
that
bird
be
my
bird
,
or
some
vile
copy
set
up
to
represent
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
farther
to
add
upon
him
,
but
that
from
that
time
to
this
I
have
bear
this
poor
starling
as
the
crest
to
my
arm
.
  
<EOS>
thus
<EOS>
:
  
[
picture
which
can
not
be
reproduce

and
let
the
herald
's
officer
twist
his
neck
about
if
they
dare
.
  
<EOS>
the
ADDRESS
.
 
<EOS>
VERSAILLES
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
not
like
to
have
my
enemy
take
a
view
of
my
mind
when
I
be
go
to
ask
protection
of
any
man
;
for
which
reason
I
generally
endeavour
to
protect
myself
;
but
this
go
to
Monsieur
le
Duc
de
C
#
#
#
#
be
an
act
of
compulsion
;
have
it
be
an
act
of
choice
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
do
it
,
I
suppose
,
like
other
people
.
  
<EOS>
how
many
mean
plan
of
dirty
address
,
as
I
go
along
,
do
my
servile
heart
form
!
 
<EOS>
I
deserve
the
Bastile
for
every
one
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
then
nothing
would
serve
me
when
I
get
within
sight
of
Versailles
,
but
put
word
and
sentence
together
,
and
conceive
attitude
and
tone
to
wreath
myself
into
Monsieur
le
Duc
de
C
#
#
#
#
's
good
grace
.
 
<EOS>
this
will
do
,
say
I.
 
just
as
well
,
retort
I
again
,
as
a
coat
carry
up
to
him
by
an
adventurous
tailor
,
without
take
his
measure
.
 
<EOS>
Fool
!
<EOS>
continue
I
,
 
see
Monsieur
le
Duc
's
face
first
;
 
observe
what
character
be
write
in
it
;
 
take
notice
in
what
posture
he
stand
to
hear
you
;
 
mark
the
turn
and
expression
of
his
body
and
limb
;
 
and
for
the
tone
,
 
the
first
sound
which
come
from
his
lip
will
give
it
you
;
and
from
all
these
together
you
will
compound
an
address
at
once
upon
the
spot
,
which
can
not
disgust
the
Duke
;
 
the
ingredient
be
his
own
,
and
most
likely
to
go
down
.
  
<EOS>
well
!
say
I
,
I
wish
it
well
over
.
 
<EOS>
Coward
again
!
<EOS>
as
if
man
to
man
be
not
equal
throughout
the
whole
surface
of
the
globe
;
and
if
in
the
field
 
why
not
face
to
face
in
the
cabinet
too
?
 
<EOS>
and
trust
me
,
Yorick
,
whenever
it
be
not
so
,
man
be
false
to
himself
and
betray
his
own
succour
ten
time
where
nature
do
it
once
.
 
<EOS>
go
to
the
Duc
de
C
#
#
#
#
with
the
Bastile
in
thy
look
;
 
my
life
for
it
,
thou
wilt
be
send
back
to
Paris
in
half
an
hour
with
an
escort
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
so
,
say
I.
 
<EOS>
then
I
will
go
to
the
Duke
,
by
heaven
!
<EOS>
with
all
the
gaiety
and
debonairness
in
the
world
.
        
<EOS>
and
there
you
be
wrong
again
,
reply
<EOS>
I.
 
a
heart
at
ease
,
Yorick
,
fly
into
no
extreme
 
'
tis
ever
on
its
centre
.
 
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
cry
I
,
as
the
coachman
turn'd
<EOS>
in
at
the
gate
,
I
find
I
shall
do
very
well
:
 
and
by
the
time
he
have
wheel'd
round
the
court
,
and
bring
me
up
to
the
door
,
I
find
myself
so
much
the
well
for
my
own
lecture
,
that
I
neither
ascend
the
step
like
a
victim
to
justice
,
who
be
to
part
with
life
upon
the
top
most
,
  
nor
do
I
mount
them
with
a
skip
and
a
couple
of
stride
,
as
I
do
when
I
fly
up
,
Eliza
!
<EOS>
to
thee
to
meet
it
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
enter
the
door
of
the
saloon
I
be
meet
by
a
person
,
who
possibly
may
be
the
maitre
d'hotel
,
but
have
more
the
air
of
one
of
the
under
secretary
,
who
tell
me
the
Duc
de
C
#
#
#
#
be
busy
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
utterly
ignorant
,
say
I
,
of
the
form
of
obtain
an
audience
,
be
an
absolute
stranger
,
and
what
be
bad
in
the
present
conjuncture
of
affair
,
be
an
Englishman
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
reply
,
that
do
not
increase
the
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
I
make
him
a
slight
bow
,
and
tell
him
,
I
have
something
of
importance
to
say
to
Monsieur
le
Duc
.
 
<EOS>
the
secretary
look'd
<EOS>
towards
the
stair
,
as
if
he
be
about
to
leave
me
to
carry
up
this
account
to
some
one
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
not
mislead
you
,
say
I
,
 
for
what
I
have
to
say
be
of
no
manner
of
importance
to
Monsieur
le
Duc
de
C
<EOS>
#
#
#
#
but
of
great
importance
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
c'est
<EOS>
une
autre
affaire
,
reply
he
.
 
<EOS>
not
at
all
,
say
I
,
to
a
man
of
gallantry
.
 
<EOS>
but
pray
,
good
sir
,
continue
I
,
when
can
a
stranger
hope
to
have
access
?
 
<EOS>
in
not
less
than
two
hour
,
say
he
,
look
at
his
watch
.
 
<EOS>
the
number
of
equipage
in
the
court
-
yard
seem
to
justify
the
calculation
,
that
I
could
have
no
near
a
prospect
;
  
and
as
walk
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
saloon
,
without
a
soul
to
commune
with
,
be
for
the
time
as
bad
as
be
in
the
Bastile
itself
,
I
instantly
go
back
to
my
remise
,
and
bid
the
coachman
drive
me
to
the
Cordon
Bleu
,
which
be
the
near
hotel
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
there
be
a
fatality
in
it
;
 
I
seldom
go
to
the
place
I
set
out
for
.
  
<EOS>
LE
PATISSIER
.
 
<EOS>
VERSAILLES
.
  
<EOS>
before
I
have
get
half
way
down
the
street
<EOS>
I
change
my
mind
:
 
as
I
be
at
Versailles
,
think
I
,
I
may
as
well
take
a
view
of
the
town
;
<EOS>
so
I
pull'd
<EOS>
the
cord
,
and
order
the
coachman
to
drive
round
some
of
the
principal
street
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
town
be
not
very
large
,
say
I.
 
the
coachman
begg'd
pardon
for
set
me
right
,
and
tell
me
it
be
very
superb
,
and
that
number
of
the
first
duke
and
marquise
and
count
have
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
the
Count
de
b
#
#
#
#
,
of
whom
the
bookseller
at
the
Quai
de
Conti
have
speak
so
handsomely
the
night
before
,
come
instantly
into
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
and
why
should
I
not
go
,
<EOS>
think
I
,
to
the
Count
de
B
#
#
#
#
,
who
have
so
high
an
idea
of
english
book
and
english
man
 
and
tell
him
my
story
?
<EOS>
so
I
change
my
mind
a
second
time
.
 
<EOS>
in
truth
it
be
the
third
;
for
I
have
intend
that
day
for
Madame
de
R
#
#
#
#
,
in
the
Rue
St.
Pierre
,
and
have
devoutly
send
her
word
by
her
fille
de
chambre
that
I
would
assuredly
wait
upon
her
;
 
but
I
be
govern
by
circumstance
;
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
govern
them
:
<EOS>
so
see
a
man
stand
with
a
basket
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
,
as
if
he
have
something
to
sell
,
I
bid
La
Fleur
go
up
to
him
,
and
enquire
for
the
Count
's
hotel
.
  
<EOS>
La
Fleur
return
a
little
pale
;
and
tell
me
it
be
a
Chevalier
de
St.
Louis
selling
pate
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
impossible
,
La
Fleur
,
say
i.
 
La
Fleur
could
no
more
account
for
the
phenomenon
than
myself
;
but
persist
in
his
story
:
 
he
have
see
the
croix
set
in
gold
,
with
its
red
riband
,
he
say
,
tie
to
his
buttonhole
 
and
have
look
into
the
basket
and
see
the
pate
which
the
Chevalier
be
sell
;
so
could
not
be
mistake
in
that
.
  
<EOS>
such
a
reverse
in
man
's
life
awaken
a
well
principle
than
curiosity
:
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
look
for
some
time
at
him
as
I
sit
in
the
remise
:
  
<EOS>
t
he
more
<EOS>
I
look'd
<EOS>
at
him
,
his
croix
,
and
his
basket
,
the
strong
they
wove
themselves
into
my
brain
.
 
<EOS>
I
get
out
of
the
remise
,
and
go
towards
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
begirt
with
a
clean
linen
apron
which
fall
below
his
knee
,
and
with
a
sort
of
a
bib
that
go
half
way
up
his
breast
;
upon
the
top
of
this
,
but
a
little
below
the
hem
,
hang
his
croix
.
 
<EOS>
His
basket
of
little
pate
be
cover
over
with
a
white
damask
napkin
;
another
of
the
same
kind
be
spread
at
the
bottom
;
and
there
be
a
look
of
proprete
and
neatness
throughout
,
that
one
may
have
buy
his
pate
of
him
,
as
much
from
appetite
as
sentiment
.
  
<EOS>
He
make
an
offer
of
them
to
neither
;
but
stand
still
with
them
at
the
corner
of
an
hotel
,
for
those
to
buy
who
choose
it
without
solicitation
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
about
forty
-
eight
;
 
of
a
sedate
look
,
something
approach
to
gravity
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
I
go
up
rather
to
the
basket
than
him
,
and
have
lift
up
the
napkin
,
and
take
one
of
his
pate
into
my
hand
,
 
<EOS>
I
begg'd
<EOS>
he
would
explain
the
appearance
which
affect
me
.
  
<EOS>
He
tell
me
in
a
few
word
,
that
the
good
part
of
his
life
have
pass
in
the
service
,
in
which
,
after
spend
a
small
patrimony
,
he
have
obtain
a
company
and
the
croix
with
it
;
but
that
,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
last
peace
,
his
regiment
be
reform
,
and
the
whole
corps
,
with
those
of
some
other
regiment
,
leave
without
any
provision
,
he
find
himself
in
a
wide
world
without
friend
,
without
a
livre
,
 
and
indeed
,
say
he
,
without
anything
but
this
,
  
(
point
,
as
he
say
it
,
to
his
croix
)
.
 
<EOS>
the
poor
Chevalier
win
my
pity
,
and
he
finish
the
scene
with
win
my
esteem
too
.
  
<EOS>
the
king
,
he
say
,
be
the
most
generous
of
prince
,
but
his
generosity
could
neither
relieve
nor
reward
everyone
,
and
it
be
only
his
misfortune
to
be
amongst
the
number
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
little
wife
,
he
say
,
whom
he
love
,
who
do
the
patisserie
;
and
add
,
he
feel
no
dishonour
in
defend
her
and
himself
from
want
in
this
way
 
unless
Providence
have
offer'd
<EOS>
him
a
well
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
wicked
to
withhold
a
pleasure
from
the
good
,
in
pass
over
what
happen'd
<EOS>
to
this
poor
Chevalier
of
St.
Louis
about
nine
month
after
.
  
<EOS>
It
seem
he
usually
take
his
stand
near
the
iron
gate
which
lead
up
to
the
palace
,
and
as
his
croix
have
catch
the
eye
of
number
,
number
have
make
the
same
enquiry
which
I
have
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
tell
them
the
same
story
,
and
always
with
so
much
modesty
and
good
sense
,
that
it
have
reach'd
<EOS>
at
last
the
king
's
ear
;
 
<EOS>
who
,
hear
the
Chevalier
have
be
a
gallant
officer
,
and
respect
by
the
whole
regiment
as
a
man
of
honour
and
integrity
,
 
he
break
up
his
little
trade
by
a
pension
of
fifteen
hundred
livre
a
year
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
have
tell
this
to
please
the
reader
,
I
beg
he
will
allow
me
to
relate
another
,
out
of
its
order
,
to
please
myself
:
  
<EOS>
t
he
two
story
reflect
light
upon
each
other
,
 
and
'
tis
a
pity
they
should
be
part
.
  
<EOS>
the
sword
.
 
<EOS>
RENNES
.
  
<EOS>
when
state
and
empire
have
their
period
of
declension
,
and
feel
in
their
turn
what
distress
and
poverty
be
,
 
I
stop
not
to
tell
the
cause
which
gradually
bring
the
house
d'e
#
#
#
#
,
in
Brittany
,
into
decay
.
 
<EOS>
the
Marquis
d'e
<EOS>
#
#
#
#
have
fight
up
against
his
condition
with
great
firmness
;
wish
to
preserve
,
and
still
show
to
the
world
,
some
little
fragment
of
what
his
ancestor
have
be
;
 
their
indiscretion
have
put
it
out
of
his
power
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
enough
leave
for
the
little
exigency
of
OBSCURITY
.
 
<EOS>
but
he
have
two
boy
who
look
up
to
him
for
LIGHT
;
 
<EOS>
he
think
they
deserve
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
try
his
sword
 
it
could
not
open
the
way
,
 
the
MOUNTING
be
too
expensive
,
 
and
simple
economy
be
not
a
match
for
it
:
  
<EOS>
t
here
be
no
resource
but
commerce
.
  
<EOS>
in
any
other
province
in
France
,
save
Brittany
,
this
be
smite
the
root
for
ever
of
the
little
tree
his
pride
and
affection
wish'd
to
see
re
-
blossom
.
 
<EOS>
but
in
Brittany
,
there
be
a
provision
for
this
,
he
avail'd
<EOS>
himself
of
it
;
and
,
take
an
occasion
when
the
state
be
assemble
at
Rennes
,
the
Marquis
,
attend
with
his
two
boy
,
enter
the
court
;
and
have
plead
the
right
of
an
ancient
law
of
the
duchy
,
which
,
though
seldom
claim'd
,
he
say
,
be
no
less
in
force
<EOS>
,
he
take
his
sword
from
his
side
:
  
H
ere
,
say
he
,
take
it
;
and
be
trusty
guardian
of
it
,
till
well
time
put
me
in
condition
to
reclaim
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
president
accept
the
Marquis
's
sword
:
 
<EOS>
he
staid
a
few
minute
to
see
it
deposit
in
the
archive
of
his
house
 
and
depart
.
  
<EOS>
the
Marquis
and
his
whole
family
embark
the
next
clay
for
Martinico
,
and
in
about
nineteen
or
twenty
year
of
successful
application
to
business
,
with
some
unlook'd
<EOS>
for
bequest
from
distant
branch
of
his
house
,
return
home
to
reclaim
his
nobility
,
and
to
support
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
an
incident
of
good
fortune
which
will
never
happen
to
any
traveller
but
a
sentimental
one
,
that
I
should
be
at
Rennes
at
the
very
time
of
this
solemn
requisition
:
 
<EOS>
I
call
it
solemn
;
 
it
be
so
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
Marquis
enter
the
court
with
his
whole
family
:
 
<EOS>
he
support
his
lady
,
 
his
eld
son
support
his
sister
,
and
his
young
be
at
the
other
extreme
of
the
line
next
his
mother
;
 
he
put
his
handkerchief
to
his
face
twice
.
        
<EOS>
there
be
a
dead
silence
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
Marquis
have
approach
within
six
pace
of
the
tribunal
,
he
give
the
Marchioness
to
his
young
son
,
and
advance
three
step
before
his
family
,
 
he
reclaim'd
<EOS>
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
His
sword
be
give
him
,
and
the
moment
he
get
it
into
his
hand
he
draw
it
almost
out
of
the
scabbard
:
  
'
twa
the
shine
face
of
a
friend
he
have
once
give
up
 
he
look'd
<EOS>
attentively
along
it
,
begin
at
the
hilt
,
as
if
to
see
whether
it
be
the
same
,
  
when
,
observe
a
little
rust
which
it
have
contract
near
the
point
,
he
bring
it
near
his
eye
,
and
bend
his
head
down
over
it
,
 
<EOS>
I
think
 
I
see
a
tear
fall
upon
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
be
deceive
by
what
follow
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
find
,
"
say
he
,
"
some
OTHER
WAY
to
get
it
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
when
the
Marquis
have
say
this
,
he
return
his
sword
into
its
scabbard
,
make
a
bow
to
the
guardian
of
it
,
 
and
,
with
his
wife
and
daughter
,
and
his
two
son
follow
him
,
<EOS>
walk'd
out

<EOS>
o

how
I
envy
him
his
feeling
!
  
<EOS>
the
passport

<EOS>
VERSAILLES

<EOS>
I
find
no
difficulty
in
get
admittance
to
Monsieur

<EOS>
the
set
of
Shakespeares
be
lay
upon
the
table
,
and
he
be
tumble
them
over
.
 
<EOS>
I
walk'd
up
close
to
the
table
,
and
give
first
such
a
look
at
the
book
as
to
make
him
conceive
<EOS>
I
know
what
they
be
<EOS>
,
 
I
tell
him
I
have
come
without
any
one
to
present
me
,
know
I
should
meet
with
a
friend
in
his
apartment
,
who
,
I
trust
,
would
do
it
for
me
:
  
<EOS>
i

be
my
countryman
,
the
great
Shakespeare
,
say
I
,
point
to
his
work
 
<EOS>
et
<EOS>
ayez

apostrophize
his

add
I

<EOS>
the
Count
smile
at
the
singularity
of
the
introduction
;
and
see
I
look'd
<EOS>
a
little
pale
and
sickly
,
insist
upon
my
take
an
arm
-
chair
;
so
I
sit
down
;
and
to
save
him
conjecture
upon
a
visit
so
out
of
all
rule
,
I
tell
him
simply
of
the
incident
in
the
bookseller
's
shop
,
and
how
that
have
impel
me
rather
to
go
to
him
with
the
story
of
a
little
embarrassment
I
be
under
,
than
to
any
other
man
in
France
.
 
<EOS>
and
what
be
your
embarrassment
?
<EOS>
let
me
hear
it
,
say
the
Count
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
tell
him
the
story
just
as
I
have
tell
it
the
reader
.
     
<EOS>
and
the
master
of
my
hotel
,
say
I
,
as
I
conclude
it
,
will
need
have
it
,
Monsieur
le
Count
,
that
I
shall
be
send
to
the
Bastile
;
  
but
I
have
no
apprehension
,
continue
I
;
 
for
,
in
fall
into
the
hand
of
the
most
polish'd
people
in
the
world
,
and
be
conscious
<EOS>
I
be
a
true
man
,
and
not
come
to
spy
the
nakedness
of
the
land
<EOS>
,
I
scarce
think
I
lie
at
their
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
It
do
not
suit
the
gallantry
of
the
French
,
Monsieur
le
Count
,
say
I
,
to
show
it
against
invalid
.
  
<EOS>
an
animate
blush
come
into
the
Count
de
B
#
#
#
#
's
cheek
as
I
speak
this
.
 
<EOS>
Ne
craignez
rien
 
do
not
fear
,
say
he
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
do
not
,
reply
I
again
.
 
<EOS>
besides
,
continue
I
,
a
little
sportingly
,
I
have
come
laugh
all
the
way
from
London
to
Paris
,
and
I
do
not
think
Monsieur
le
Duc
de
Choiseul
be
such
an
enemy
to
mirth
as
to
send
me
back
cry
for
my
pain
.
     
<EOS>
My
application
to
you
,
Monsieur
le
Count
de
B
#
#
#
#
(
<EOS>
make
him
a
low
bow
)
,
be
to
desire
he
will
not
.
  
<EOS>
the
Count
hear
me
with
great
good
nature
,
or
I
have
not
say
half
as
much
,
 
and
once
or
twice
say
,
 
c'est
bien
dit
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
rest
my
cause
there
 
and
determine
to
say
no
more
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
Count
lead
the
discourse
:
 
we
talk'd
of
indifferent
thing
,
 
of
book
,
and
politic
,
and
man
;
 
and
then
of
woman
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
them
all
!
<EOS>
say
I
,
after
much
discourse
about
them
 
there
be
not
a
man
upon
earth
who
love
them
so
much
as
I
do
:
 
after
all
the
foible
I
have
see
,
and
all
the
satire
I
have
read
against
them
,
still
I
love
them
;
be
firmly
persuade
that
a
man
,
who
have
not
a
sort
of
affection
for
the
whole
sex
,
be
incapable
of
ever
love
a
single
one
as
he
ought
.
  
<EOS>
Eh
bien
!
 
<EOS>
Monsieur
l'Anglois
,
say
the
Count
,
gaily
;
 
you
be
not
come
to
spy
the
nakedness
of
the
land
;
 
<EOS>
I
believe
you
;
 
ni
encore
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
that
of
our
woman
!
 
<EOS>
but
permit
me
to
conjecture
,
 
if
,
par
hazard
,
they
fall
into
your
way
,
that
the
prospect
would
not
affect
you
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
something
within
me
which
can
not
bear
the
shock
of
the
least
indecent
insinuation
:
 
in
the
sportability
of
chit
-
chat
I
have
often
endeavour
to
conquer
it
,
and

very

break
off

a

sparrow
upon

which
have
incommode

off

write
Bevoriskius

I

have
the

to
mark
them
down
one

the
cock
sparrow
,
during
the
little

that
I
could
have
finish
the

,
have
actually
interrupt
me
with
the

three

twenty

a

<EOS>
how
merciful

add

be

Ill

that

that
the

have
occasion

turn
for
every
key
in

so
that
if
you
begin
a

too
high

low

there
must
be
a
want
either
in

it
go

there
be

be
empower'd

I
must
not
presume
to
say
how
far
this
have
affect
the
French
in
the
subject
we
be
speak

but
,
should
it
ever
be
the
case
of
the
English
,
in
the
progress
of
their
refinement
,
to
arrive
at
the
same
polish
which
distinguish
the
French

if
we
do
not
lose
the
politesse
du

which
incline
man
more
to
humane
action
than
courteous
one

<EOS>
we
should
at

lose
that
distinct

and
originality
of

which
distinguish
them

not

from
each
other

from
all

le
Count
,
<EOS>
say
I
,
rise
up
,
and
lay
them
before
him
upon
the
table
,
 
by
jingle
and
rub
one
against
another
for
seventy
year
together
in
one
body
's
pocket
or
another
<EOS>
be
,
they
be
become
so
much
alike
,
you
can
scarce
distinguish
one
shill
from
another
.
  
<EOS>
the
English
,
like
ancient
medal
,
keep
more
apart
,
and
passing
but
few
people
's
hand
,
preserve
the
first
sharpness
which
the
fine
hand
of
Nature
have
give
them
;
 
they
be
not
so
pleasant
to
feel
,
  
but
in
return
the
legend
be
so
visible
,
that
at
the
first
look
you
see
whose
image
and
superscription
they
bear
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
French
,
Monsieur
le
Count
,
add
I
(
<EOS>
wish
to
soften
what
I
have
say
)
,
have
so
many
excellence
,
they
can
the
better
spare
this
;
 
<EOS>
they
be
a
loyal
,
a
gallant
,
a
generous
,
an
ingenious
,
and
good
temper'd
people
as
be
under
heaven
;
 
if
they
have
a
fault
 
they
be
too
SERIOUS
.
  
<EOS>
Mon
Dieu
!
<EOS>
cry
the
Count
,
rise
out
of
his
chair
.
  
<EOS>
Mais
vous
plaisantez
,
say
he
,
correct
his
exclamation
.
 
<EOS>
I
lay
my
hand
upon
my
breast
,
and
with
earnest
gravity
assure
him
it
be
my
most
settled
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
the
Count
say
he
be
mortify
he
could
not
stay
to
hear
my
reason
,
be
engage
to
go
that
moment
to
dine
with
the
Duc
de
C
#

.
  
<EOS>
but
if
it
be
not
too
far
to
come
to
Versailles
to
eat
your
soup
with
me
,
I
beg
,
before
you
leave
France
,
I
may
have
the
pleasure
of
know
you
retract
your
opinion
,
 
or
,
in
what
manner
you
support
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
,
if
you
do
support
it
,
Monsieur
Anglois
,
say
he
,
you
must
do
it
with
all
your
power
,
because
you
have
the
whole
world
against
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
promise
the
Count
<EOS>
I
would
do
myself
the
honour
of
dining
with
him
before
I
set
out
for
Italy
;
 
so
take
my
leave

<EOS>
the
TEMPTATION
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
alight
at
the
hotel
,
the
porter
tell
me
a
young
woman
with
a
bandbox
have
be
that
moment
enquire
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
,
say
the
porter
,
whether
she
be
go
away
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
the
key
of
my
chamber
of
him
,
and
go
upstairs
;
and
when
I
have
get
within
ten
step
of
the
top
of
the
landing
before
my
door
,
I
meet
her
come
easily
down
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
fair
fille
de
chambre
<EOS>
I
have
walk
along
the
Quai
de
Conti
with
;
Madame
de
R
#

#

have
send
her
upon
some
commission
to
a
marchande
des
mode
within
a
step
or
two
of
the
Hotel
de
Modene
;
and
as
I
have
fail'd
in
wait
upon
her
,
have
bid
her
enquire
if
I
have
leave
Paris
;
and
if
so
,
whether
I
have
not
leave
a
letter
address
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
fair
fille
de
chambre
be
so
near
my
door
,
she
return
back
,
and
go
into
the
room
with
me
for
a
moment
or
two
<EOS>
whilst
I
write
a
card
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
fine
still
evening
in
the
latter
end
of
the
month
of
May
,
  
<EOS>
-the
crimson
window
curtain
(
which
be
of
the
same
colour
as
those
of
the
bed
)
be
draw
close
:
  
t
he
sun
be
set
,
and
reflect
through
them
so
warm
a
tint
into
the
fair
fille
de
chambre
's
face
,
 
<EOS>
I
think
she
blush'd
;
 
the
idea
of
it
make
me
blush
myself
:
  
<EOS>
w
e
be
quite
alone
;
and
that
superinduce
a
second
blush
before
the
first
could
get
off
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
sort
of
a
pleasing
half
guilty
blush
,
where
the
blood
be
more
in
fault
than
the
man
:
  
'
tis
send
impetuous
from
the
heart
,
and
virtue
fly
after
it
,
 
not
to
call
it
back
,
but
to
make
the
sensation
of
it
more
delicious
to
the
nerve
:
  
'
tis
associate
.
     
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
describe
it
;
 
I
feel
something
at
first
within
me
which
be
not
in
strict
unison
with
the
lesson
of
virtue
I
have
give
her
the
night
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
seek
five
minute
for
a
card
;
 
I
know
I
have
not
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
up
a
pen
.
 
<EOS>
I
lay
it
down
again
;
 
my
hand
tremble
:
  
t
he
devil
be
in
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
as
well
as
any
one
he
be
an
adversary
,
whom
,
if
we
resist
,
he
will
fly
from
us
;
 
<EOS>
but
I
seldom
resist
him
at
all
;
from
a
terror
,
though
I
may
conquer
,
I
may
still
get
a
hurt
in
the
combat
;
 
so
I
give
up
the
triumph
for
security
;
and
,
instead
of
think
to
make
him
fly
,
I
generally
fly
myself
.
  
<EOS>
the
fair
fille
de
chambre
come
close
up
to
the
bureau
where
I
be
look
for
a
card
 
take
up
first
the
pen
I
cast
down
,
then
offer'd
to
hold
me
the
ink
;
she
offer'd
<EOS>
it
so
sweetly
,
I
be
go
to
accept
it
;
 
<EOS>
but
I
durst
not
;
 
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
,
my
dear
,
say
I
,
to
write
upon
.
 
<EOS>
write
it
,
say
she
,
simply
,
upon
anything
.
     
<EOS>
I
be
just
go
to
cry
out
<EOS>
,
then
I
will
write
it
,
fair
girl
!
<EOS>
upon
thy
lip
.
     
<EOS>
if
I
do
,
say
I
,
I
shall
perish
;
 
<EOS>
so
I
take
her
by
the
hand
,
and
lead
her
to
the
door
,
and
begg'd
<EOS>
she
would
not
forget
the
lesson
I
have
give
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
say
,
indeed
she
would
not
;
 
and
,
as
she
utter
it
with
some
earnestness
,
she
turn'd
about
,
and
give
me
both
her
hand
,
close
together
,
into
mine
;
 
it
be
impossible
not
to
compress
them
in
that
situation
;
 
I
<EOS>
wish'd
to
let
them
go
;
and
all
the
time
I
hold
them
,
I
keep
argue
within
myself
against
it
,
  
-and
still
I
hold
them
on
.
 
<EOS>
in
two
minute
I
find
I
have
all
the
battle
to
fight
over
again
;
 
<EOS>
and
I
feel
my
leg
and
every
limb
about
me
tremble
at
the
idea
.
  
<EOS>
the
foot
of
the
bed
be
within
a
yard
and
a
half
of
the
place
where
we
be
stand
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
still
hold
of
her
hand
 
<EOS>
and
how
it
happen
<EOS>
I
can
give
no
account
;
but
<EOS>
I
neither
ask'd
her
 
nor
draw
her
 
nor
do
I
think
of
the
bed
;
 
but
so
it
do
happen
,
we
both
sit
down
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
just
show
you
,
say
the
fair
fille
de
chambre
,
the
little
purse
I
have
be
make
to
-
day
to
hold
your
crown
.
 
<EOS>
so
she
put
her
hand
into
her
right
pocket
,
which
be
next
me
,
and
feel
for
it
some
time
 
then
into
the
left
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
have
lose
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
never
bear
expectation
more
quietly
;
 
it
be
in
her
right
pocket
at
last
;
 
she
<EOS>
pull'd
it
out
<EOS>
;
it
be
of
green
taffeta
,
line
with
a
little
bit
of
white
quilt
satin
,
and
just
big
enough
to
hold
the
crown
:
 
<EOS>
she
put
it
into
my
hand
;
 
it
be
pretty
;
and
I
hold
it
ten
minute
with
the
back
of
my
hand
rest
upon
her
lap
 
look
sometimes
at
the
purse
,
sometimes
on
one
side
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
a
stitch
or
two
have
break
out
in
the
gather
of
my
stock
;
the
fair
fille
de
chambre
,
without
say
a
word
,
take
out
her
little
housewife
,
thread
a
small
needle
,
and
sew'd
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
foresaw
it
would
hazard
the
glory
of
the
day
;
and
,
as
she
<EOS>
pass'd
<EOS>
her
hand
in
silence
across
and
across
my
neck
in
the
manoeuvre
<EOS>
,
I
feel
the
laurel
shake
which
fancy
have
wreath'd
<EOS>
about
my
head
.
  
<EOS>
a
strap
have
give
way
in
her
walk
,
and
the
buckle
of
her
shoe
be
just
fall
off
.
 
<EOS>
See
<EOS>
,
say
the
fille
de
chambre
,
hold
up
her
foot
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
,
for
my
soul
but
fasten
the
buckle
in
return
,
and
put
in
the
strap
,
 
and
lift
up
the
other
foot
with
it
,
when
I
have
do
,
to
see
both
be
right
,
 
in
do
it
too
suddenly
,
it
unavoidably
throw
the
fair
fille
de
chambre
off
her
centre
,
 
and
then
     
the
CONQUEST
.
  
<EOS>
yes
,
 
and
then
  
.
 
<EOS>
Ye
whose
clay
-
cold
head
and
luke
-
warm
heart
can
argue
down
or
mask
your
passion
,
tell
me
,
what
trespass
be
it
that
man
should
have
them
?
<EOS>
or
how
his
spirit
stand
answerable
to
the
Father
of
spirit
but
for
his
conduct
under
them
?
  
<EOS>
if
Nature
have
so
wove
her
web
of
kindness
,
that
some
thread
of
love
and
desire
be
entangle
with
the
piece
,
 
must
the
whole
web
be
rend
in
draw
them
out
?
 
<EOS>
whip
me
such
stoic
,
great
Governor
of
Nature
!
<EOS>
say
I
to
myself
:
  
<EOS>
w
herever
thy
providence
shall
place
me
for
the
trial
of
my
virtue
;
 
<EOS>
whatever
be
my
danger
,
 
<EOS>
whatever
be
my
situation
,
 
let
me
feel
the
movement
which
rise
out
of
it
,
and
which
belong
to
me
as
a
man
,
 
and
,
if
I
govern
them
as
a
good
one
,
I
will
trust
the
issue
to
thy
justice
;
for
thou
hast
make
us
,
and
not
we
ourselves
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
finish
my
address
,
I
raise
the
fair
fille
de
chambre
up
by
the
hand
,
and
lead
her
out
of
the
room
:
  
<EOS>
s
he
stand
by
me
till
I
lock
the
door
and
put
the
key
in
my
pocket
,
 
and
then
,
 
the
victory
be
quite
decisive
 
and
not
till
then
,
I
press'd
<EOS>
my
lip
to
her
cheek
,
and
take
her
by
the
hand
again
,
lead
her
safe
to
the
gate
of
the
hotel
.
  
<EOS>
the
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
if
a
man
know
the
heart
,
he
will
know
it
be
impossible
to
go
back
instantly
to
my
chamber
;
 
it
be
touch
a
cold
key
with
a
flat
third
to
it
upon
the
close
of
a
piece
of
music
,
which
have
call'd
forth
my
affection
:
  
<EOS>
t
herefore
,
when
I
let
go
the
hand
of
the
fille
de
chambre
,
I
remain
at
the
gate
of
the
hotel
for
some
time
,
look
at
every
one
who
pass'd
<EOS>
by
,
 
and
form
conjecture
upon
them
,
till
my
attention
get
fix'd
upon
a
single
object
which
confound
all
kind
of
reason
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
tall
figure
of
a
philosophic
,
serious
,
adust
look
,
which
pass
and
repass'd
sedately
along
the
street
,
make
a
turn
of
about
sixty
pace
on
each
side
of
the
gate
of
the
hotel
;
 
<EOS>
the
man
be
about
fifty
-
two
 
have
a
small
cane
under
his
arm
 
be
dress'd
<EOS>
in
a
dark
drab
-
colour'd
coat
,
waistcoat
,
and
breech
,
which
seem'd
to
have
see
some
year
service
:
  
t
hey
be
still
clean
,
and
there
be
a
little
air
of
frugal
proprete
throughout
him
.
 
<EOS>
by
his
pulling
off
his
hat
,
and
his
attitude
of
accost
a
good
many
in
his
way
,
I
see
he
be
ask
charity
:
 
<EOS>
so
I
get
a
sous
or
two
out
of
my
pocket
ready
to
give
him
,
as
he
take
me
in
his
turn
.
 
<EOS>
He
pass'd
by
me
without
ask
anything
 
and
yet
do
not
go
five
step
further
before
he
ask'd
charity
of
a
little
woman
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
much
more
likely
to
have
give
of
the
two
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
scarce
do
with
the
woman
,
when
he
pull'd
off
his
hat
to
another
who
be
come
the
same
way
.
 
<EOS>
an
ancient
gentleman
come
slowly
 
and
,
after
him
,
a
young
smart
one
.
  
<EOS>
He
let
them
both
pass
,
and
ask'd
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
stand
observe
him
half
an
hour
,
in
which
time
he
have
make
a
dozen
turn
backwards
and
forwards
,
and
find
that
he
invariably
pursue
the
same
plan
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
two
thing
very
singular
in
this
,
which
set
my
brain
to
work
,
and
to
no
purpose
:
  
t
he
first
be
,
why
the
man
should
only
tell
his
story
to
the
sex
;
 
and
,
secondly
,
 
what
kind
of
story
it
be
,
and
what
specie
of
eloquence
it
could
be
,
<EOS>
which
soften'd
<EOS>
the
heart
of
the
woman
,
which
he
know
'
twas
to
no
purpose
to
practise
upon
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
two
other
circumstance
,
which
entangle
this
mystery
;
  
the
one
be
,
he
tell
every
woman
what
he
have
to
say
in
her
ear
,
and
in
a
way
which
have
much
more
the
air
of
a
secret
than
a
petition
;
  
the
other
be
,
it
be
always
successful
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
<EOS>
stopp'd
<EOS>
a
woman
,
but
she
pull'd
out
her
purse
,
and
immediately
give
him
something
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
form
no
system
to
explain
the
phenomenon
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
get
a
riddle
to
amuse
me
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
;
so
I
<EOS>
walk'd
upstairs
to
my
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
the
case
of
CONSCIENCE
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
immediately
follow
up
by
the
master
of
the
hotel
,
who
come
into
my
room
to
tell
me
I
must
provide
lodging
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
how
so
,
friend
?
<EOS>
say
<EOS>
I.
 
He
answer
,
I
have
have
a
young
woman
lock'd
up
with
me
<EOS>
two
hour
that
evening
in
my
bedchamber
,
and
'
twas
against
the
rule
of
his
house
.
 
<EOS>
very
well
,
say
I
,
we
will
all
part
friend
then
,
 
for
the
girl
be
no
bad
,
 
and
I
be
no
bad
,
 
and
you
will
be
just
as
I
find
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
enough
,
he
say
,
to
overthrow
the
credit
of
his
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
Voyez
vous
,
Monsieur
,
say
he
,
point
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
we
have
be
sit
upon
.
 
<EOS>
I
own
it
have
something
of
the
appearance
of
an
evidence
;
but
my
pride
not
suffer
me
to
enter
into
any
detail
of
the
case
,
I
exhort
him
to
let
his
soul
sleep
in
peace
,
as
I
resolve
to
let
mine
do
that
night
,
and
that
I
would
discharge
what
I
owe
him
at
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
mind
,
Monsieur
,
say
he
,
if
you
have
have
twenty
girl
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
score
more
,
reply
I
,
interrupt
him
,
than
I
ever
reckon'd
upon
 
Provided
,
add
he
<EOS>
,
it
have
be
<EOS>
but
in
a
morning
.
  
<EOS>
and
do
the
difference
of
the
time
of
the
day
at
Paris
make
a
difference
in
the
sin
?
 
<EOS>
It
make
a
difference
,
he
say
,
in
the
scandal
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
a
good
distinction
in
my
heart
;
and
can
not
say
I
be
intolerably
out
of
temper
with
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
own
it
be
necessary
,
resume
the
master
of
the
hotel
,
that
a
stranger
at
Paris
should
have
the
opportunity
present
to
him
of
buy
lace
and
silk
stocking
and
ruffle
,
et
tout
cela
;
 
and
'
tis
nothing
if
a
woman
come
with
a
band
-
box
.
 
<EOS>
o
,
my
conscience
!
<EOS>
say
I
<EOS>
,
she
have
one
<EOS>
but
I
never
look'd
<EOS>
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
then
Monsieur
,
say
he
,
have
buy
nothing
?
  
<EOS>
-Not
<EOS>
one
earthly
thing
,
reply
<EOS>
I.
 
because
,
say
he
,
I
could
recommend
one
to
you
who
would
use
you
en
conscience
.
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
see
her
this
night
,
say
I.
 
He
make
me
a
low
bow
,
and
<EOS>
walk'd
down
.
  
<EOS>
now
shall
I
triumph
over
this
maitre
d'hotel
,
cry
I
,
 
and
what
then
?
 
<EOS>
then
I
shall
let
him
see
I
know
he
be
a
dirty
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
and
what
then
?
 
<EOS>
what
then
?
 
<EOS>
I
be
too
near
myself
to
say
it
be
for
the
sake
of
other
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
good
answer
leave
;
 
there
be
more
of
spleen
than
principle
in
my
project
,
and
I
be
sick
of
it
before
the
execution
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
few
minute
the
grisette
come
in
with
her
box
of
lace
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
buy
nothing
,
however
,
say
I
,
within
myself
.
  
<EOS>
the
grisette
would
show
me
everything
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
hard
to
please
:
 
<EOS>
she
would
not
seem
to
see
it
;
she
open
her
little
magazine
,
and
lay
all
her
lace
one
after
another
before
me
;
 
unfold
and
fold
them
up
again
one
by
one
with
the
most
patient
sweetness
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
buy
,
 
or
not
;
 
she
would
let
me
have
everything
at
my
own
price
:
   
<EOS>
the
poor
creature
<EOS>
seem'd
<EOS>
anxious
to
get
a
penny
;
and
lay
herself
out
to
win
me
,
and
not
so
much
in
a
manner
which
seem'd
artful
,
as
in
one
I
feel
simple
and
caressing
.
  
<EOS>
if
there
be
not
a
fund
of
honest
gullibility
in
man
,
so
much
the
bad
;
 
my
heart
relent
,
and
I
give
up
my
second
resolution
as
quietly
as
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
why
should
I
chastise
one
for
the
trespass
of
another
?
 
<EOS>
if
thou
art
tributary
to
this
tyrant
of
an
host
,
think
I
,
look
up
in
her
face
,
so
much
hard
be
thy
bread
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
have
not
have
more
than
four
louis
d'or
in
my
purse
,
there
be
no
such
thing
as
rise
up
and
show
her
the
door
,
till
I
have
first
lay
three
of
them
out
in
a
pair
of
ruffle
.
     
<EOS>
the
master
of
the
hotel
will
share
the
profit
with
her
;
 
no
matter
,
 
then
I
have
only
pay
as
many
a
poor
soul
have
PAID
before
me
,
for
an
act
he
COULD
not
do
,
or
think
of
.
  
<EOS>
the
RIDDLE
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
when
La
Fleur
come
up
to
wait
upon
me
at
supper
,
he
tell
me
how
sorry
the
master
of
the
hotel
be
for
his
affront
to
me
in
bid
me
<EOS>
change
my
lodging
.
  
<EOS>
a
man
who
value
a
good
night
's
rest
will
not
lie
down
with
enmity
in
his
heart
,
if
he
can
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
so
I
bid
<EOS>
La
Fleur
tell
the
master
of
the
hotel
,
that
I
be
sorry
on
my
side
for
the
occasion
I
have
give
him
;
 
and
you
may
tell
him
,
if
you
will
,
La
Fleur
,
add
I
,
that
if
the
young
woman
should
call
again
,
I
shall
not
see
her
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
sacrifice
not
to
him
,
but
myself
,
have
resolve
,
after
so
narrow
an
escape
,
to
run
no
more
risk
,
but
to
leave
Paris
,
if
it
be
possible
,
with
all
the
virtue
<EOS>
I
enter'd
<EOS>
it
.
  
<EOS>
c'est
deroger
a
noblesse
,
Monsieur
,
say
La
Fleur
,
make
me
a
bow
down
to
the
ground
as
he
say
it
.
 
<EOS>
Et
encore
,
Monsieur
,
say
he
,
may
change
his
sentiment
;
 
and
if
(
par
hazard
)
<EOS>
he
should
like
to
amuse
himself
,
 
<EOS>
I
find
no
amusement
in
it
,
say
I
,
interrupt
him
.
     
<EOS>
Mon
Dieu
!
<EOS>
say
La
Fleur
,
 
and
take
away
.
  
<EOS>
in
an
hour
's
time
he
come
to
put
me
to
bed
,
and
be
more
than
commonly
officious
:
  
<EOS>
s
omething
hang
upon
his
lip
to
say
to
me
,
or
ask
me
,
which
he
could
not
get
off
:
 
I
could
not
conceive
what
it
be
,
and
indeed
give
myself
little
trouble
to
find
it
out
,
as
I
have
another
riddle
so
much
more
interesting
upon
my
mind
,
which
be
that
of
the
man
's
ask
charity
before
the
door
of
the
hotel
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
give
anything
to
have
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
;
and
that
,
not
out
of
curiosity
,
 
'
tis
so
low
a
principle
of
enquiry
,
in
general
,
I
would
not
purchase
the
gratification
of
it
with
a
two
-
sous
piece
;
 
but
a
secret
,
I
think
,
which
so
soon
and
so
certainly
soften'd
the
heart
of
every
woman
you
come
near
<EOS>
,
be
a
secret
at
least
equal
to
the
philosopher
's
stone
;
have
I
both
the
Indies
,
I
would
have
give
up
one
to
have
be
master
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
toss'd
and
turn'd
<EOS>
it
almost
all
night
long
in
my
brain
to
no
manner
of
purpose
;
and
when
I
awoke
in
the
morning
,
I
find
my
spirit
as
much
troubled
with
my
dream
,
as
ever
the
King
of
Babylon
have
be
with
his
;
and
I
will
not
hesitate
to
affirm
,
it
would
have
puzzle
all
the
wise
man
of
Paris
as
much
as
those
of
Chaldea
to
have
give
its
interpretation
.
  
<EOS>
LE
DIMANCHE
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
Sunday
;
and
when
La
Fleur
come
in
,
in
the
morning
,
with
my
coffee
and
roll
and
butter
,
he
have
get
himself
so
gallantly
<EOS>
array'd
,
I
scarce
know
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
covenant
at
Montreuil
to
give
him
a
new
hat
with
a
silver
button
and
loop
,
and
four
louis
d'or
,
pour
s'adoniser
,
when
we
get
to
Paris
;
and
the
poor
fellow
,
to
do
him
justice
,
have
do
wonder
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
buy
a
bright
,
clean
,
good
scarlet
coat
,
and
a
pair
of
breech
of
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
not
a
crown
bad
,
he
say
,
for
the
wear
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
wish'd
him
hang'd
<EOS>
for
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
<EOS>
look'd
<EOS>
so
fresh
,
that
though
I
know
the
thing
could
not
be
do
,
yet
I
would
rather
have
impose
upon
my
fancy
with
think
I
have
buy
them
new
for
the
fellow
,
than
that
they
have
come
out
of
the
Rue
de
Friperie
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
nicety
which
make
not
the
heart
sore
at
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
purchase
,
moreover
,
a
handsome
blue
satin
waistcoat
,
fancifully
enough
embroider
:
  
<EOS>
t
his
be
indeed
something
the
bad
for
the
service
it
have
do
,
but
'
twas
clean
scour'd
;
 
the
gold
have
be
touch'd
up
,
and
upon
the
whole
be
rather
showy
than
otherwise
;
 
and
as
the
blue
be
not
violent
,
it
suit
with
the
coat
and
breech
very
well
:
 
<EOS>
he
have
squeez'd
out
of
the
money
,
moreover
,
a
new
bag
and
a
solitaire
;
and
have
insist
with
the
fripi
upon
a
gold
pair
of
garter
to
his
breech
knee
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
purchase
muslin
ruffle
,
bien
brodees
,
with
four
livre
of
his
own
money
;
 
and
a
pair
of
white
silk
stocking
for
five
more
;
 
and
to
top
all
,
nature
have
give
him
a
handsome
figure
,
without
cost
him
a
sous
.
  
<EOS>
He
enter
the
room
thus
set
off
,
with
his
hair
dress
in
the
first
style
,
and
with
a
handsome
bouquet
in
his
breast
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
there
be
that
look
of
festivity
in
everything
about
him
,
which
at
once
put
me
in
mind
<EOS>
it
be
Sunday
;
 
and
,
by
combine
both
together
,
it
instantly
strike
me
,
that
the
favour
he
wish'd
to
ask
of
me
the
night
before
,
be
to
spend
the
day
as
every
body
in
Paris
spend
it
besides
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
scarce
make
the
conjecture
,
when
La
Fleur
,
with
infinite
humility
,
but
with
a
look
of
trust
,
as
if
I
should
not
refuse
him
,
begg'd
<EOS>
I
would
grant
him
the
day
,
pour
faire
le
galant
vis
-
a
-
vis
de
sa
maitresse
.
  
<EOS>
now
it

the
very
thing
I
intend
to
do
myself
vis

<EOS>
Madame
de
R

.
 
<EOS>
I
have
retain
the
remise
on
purpose
for
it
,
and
it
would
not
have
mortify
my
vanity
to
have
have
a
servant
so
well
dress'd
as
La
Fleur
be
,
to
have
get
up
behind
it
:
 
<EOS>
I
never
could
have
bad
spare
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
we
must
feel
,
not
argue
in
these
embarrassment
.
 
<EOS>
the
son
and
daughter
of
Service
part
with
liberty
,
but
not
with
nature
,
in
their
contract
;
they
be
flesh
and
blood
,
and
have
their
little
vanity
and
wish
in
the
midst
of
the
house
of
bondage
,
as
well
as
their
task
-
master
;
 
no
doubt
,
they
have
set
their
self
-
denial
at
a
price
,
 
and
their
expectation
be
so
unreasonable
,
that
I
would
often
disappoint
them
,
but
that
their
condition
put
it
so
much
in
my
power
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
behold

behold
<EOS>

I
am
THY

<EOS>
disarm
me
at

of
the

Thou

La

say
I

canst
thou
have
pick
up
in
so
little
a

at

La

let
as

slip
him
as
his

so
that
somehow

how

as
there
be
time
enough
for
me
to
win
the
Count
to
my
interest

La

have
contrive
to
make
it
do
to
win
the
maid
to
his

<EOS>
the
family

it
seem
,
be
to
be
at
Paris
that
day
,
and
he
have
make
a
party
with
her
,
and
two
or
three
more
of
the
Count

household
,
upon
the
boulevard

<EOS>
happy
people
!
<EOS>
that
once
a
week
at

be
sure
to
lay
down
all
your
care
together
,
and
dance
and
sing
and
sport
away
the
weight
of
grievance

which
bow
down
the

of

to
the

<EOS>
the
FRAGMENT
.
 
<EOS>
PARIS
.
  
<EOS>
La
Fleur
have
leave
me
something
to
amuse
myself
with
for
the
day
more
than
I
have
bargain'd
for
,
or
could
have
enter'd
<EOS>
either
into
his
head
or
mine
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
bring
the
little
print
of
butter
upon
a
currant
leaf
:
 
and
as
the
morning
be
warm
,
and
he
have
a
good
step
to
bring
it
,
he
have
begg'd
a
sheet
of
waste
paper
to
put
betwixt
the
currant
leaf
and
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
as
that
be
plate
sufficient
,
I
bid
him
lie
it
upon
the
table
as
it
be
;
and
as
I
resolve
to
stay
within
all
day
,
I
order
him
to
call
upon
the
traiteur
,
to
bespeak
my
dinner
,
and
leave
me
to
breakfast
by
myself
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
finish
the
butter
,
I
throw
the
currant
-
leaf
out
of
the
window
,
and
be
go
to
do
the
same
by
the
waste
paper
;
 
but
stop
to
read
a
line
first
,
and
that
draw
me
on
to
a
second
and
third
,
 
I
think
it
better
worth
;
so
I
shut
the
window
,
and
draw
a
chair
up
to
it
,
I
sit
down
to
read
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
old
French
of
Rabelais
's
time
,
and
for
aught
I
know
may
have
be
write
by
him

i
t
be
moreover
in
a
gothic
letter
,
and
that
so
fade
and
go
off
by
damp
and
length
of
time
,
it
cost
me
infinite
trouble
to
make
anything
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
throw
it
down
;
and
then
write
a
letter
to
Eugenius
;
 
<EOS>
then
I
take
it
up
again
,
and
embroil
my
patience
with
it
afresh
;
 
and
then
to
cure
that
,
I
write
a
letter
to
Eliza
.
 
<EOS>
still
it
keep
hold
of
me
;
and
the
difficulty
of
understand
it
increase

the
desire

<EOS>
I
get
my
dinner
;
and
after
I
have
enlighten
my
mind
with
a
bottle
of
Burgundy
;
I
at
it
again
,
 
and
,
after
two
or
three
hour
pore
upon
it
,
with
almost
as
deep
attention
as
ever
Gruter
or
Jacob
Spon
do
upon
a
nonsensical
inscription
,
I
think
I
make
sense
of
it
;
but
to
make
sure
of
it
,
the
good
way
,
I
imagine
,
be
to
turn
it
into
English
,
and
see
how
it
would
look
then
;
 
<EOS>
so
I
go
on
leisurely
,
as
a
trifling
man
do
,
sometimes
write
a
sentence
,
  
then
take
a
turn
or
two
,
 
and
then
look
how
the
world
go
,
out
of
the
window
;
<EOS>
so
that
it
be
nine
o'clock
at
night
before
I
have
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
begin
and
read
it
as
follow

I

little
of
the
many
thing
I
see
pass
at
broad
noonday
,
in
large
and
open
street
.
 
<EOS>
nature
be
shy
,
and
hate
to
act
before
spectator
;
but
in
such
an
unobserved
corner
you
sometimes
see
a
single
short
scene
of
her
worth
all
the
sentiment
of
a
dozen
french
play
compound
together
,
 
and
yet
they
be
absolutely
fine
;
 
and
whenever
I
have
a
more
brilliant
affair
upon
my
hand
than
common
,
as
they
suit
a
preacher
just
as
well
as
a
hero
,
I
generally
make
my
sermon
out
of
'em
;
 
and
for
the
text
,
 
"
Cappadocia
,
Pontus
and
Asia
,
Phrygia
and
Pamphylia

"
 
be
as
good
as
any
one
in
the
Bible
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
long
dark
passage
issue
out
from
the
Opera
Comique
into
a
narrow
street
;
'
tis
trod
by
a
few
who
humbly
wait
for
a
fiacre
,
{

}
or
wish
to
get
off
quietly
o'foot
when
the
opera
be
do
.
 
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
it
,
towards
the
theatre
,
'
tis
light
by
a
small
candle
,
the
light
of
which
be
almost
lose
before
you
get
half
-
way
down
,
but
near
the
door
 
'
tis
more
for
ornament
than
use
:
you
see
it
as
a
fix
star
of
the
least
magnitude
;
it
burn
,
 
but
do
little
good
to
the
world
,
that
we
know
of
.
  
<EOS>
in
return
along
this
passage
,
I
discern
,
as
I
approach
within
five
or
six
pace
of
the
door
<EOS>
,
two
lady
stand
arm
-
in
-
arm
with
their
back
against
the
wall
,
wait
,
as
I
imagine
,
for
a
fiacre
;
 
as
they
be
next
the
door
,
I
think
they
have
a
prior
right
;
so
edge
myself
up
within
a
yard
or
little
more
of
them
,
and
quietly
take
my
stand
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
in
black
,
and
scarce
see
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
next
me
be
a
tall
lean
figure
of
a
woman
,
of
about
thirty
-
six
;
the
other
of
the
same
size
and
make
,
of
about
forty
<EOS>
:
there
be
no
mark
of
wife
or
widow
in
any
one
part
of
either
of
them
;
 
they
seem'd
to
be
two
upright
vestal
sister
,
unsappe
by
caress
,
unbroke
in
upon
by
tender
salutation
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
wish'd
to
have
make
them
happy
:
  
<EOS>
t
heir
happiness
be
destin'd
<EOS>
that
night
,
to
come
from
another
quarter
.
  
<EOS>
a
low
voice
,
with
a
good
turn
of
expression
,
and
sweet
cadence
at
the
end
of
it
,
begg'd
for
a
twelve
-
sous
piece
betwixt
them
,
for
the
love
of
heaven
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
singular
that
a
beggar
should
fix
the
quota
of
an
alm
 
and
that
the
sum
should
be
twelve
time
as
much
as
what
be
usually
give
in
the
dark
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
seem
astonished
at
it
as
much
as
myself
.
 
<EOS>
twelve
sous
!
<EOS>
say
one
.
 
<EOS>
a
twelve

sous
piece

likewise
to
her
jacket
,
a
pale
green
riband
,
which
fall
across
her
shoulder
to
the
waist
;
at
the
end
of
which
hang
her
pipe
.
 
<EOS>
Her
goat
have
be
as
faithless
as
her
lover
;
and
she
have
get
a
little
dog
in
lieu
of
him
,
which
she
have
keep
tie
by
a
string
to
her
girdle
:
 
as
I
look
at
her
dog
<EOS>
,
she
draw
him
towards
her
with
the
string
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
shalt
not
leave
me
,
Sylvio
,
"
say
she
.
 
<EOS>
I
look'd
in
Maria
's
eye
and
see
she
be
think
more
of
her
father
than
of
her
lover
,
or
her
little
goat
;
for
,
as
she
utter'd
them
,
the
tear
trickle
down
her
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
I
sit
down
close
by
her
;
and
Maria
let
me
wipe
them
away
as
they
fall
,
with
my
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
steep'd
<EOS>
it
in
my
own
,
 
and
then
in
her
,
 
and
then
in
mine
,
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
<EOS>
wip'd
her
again
;
 
<EOS>
and
as
I
do
it
,
I
feel
such
undescribable
emotion
within
me
,
as
I
be
sure
could
not
be
account
for
from
any
combination
of
matter
and
motion
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
positive
I
have
a
soul
;
nor
can
all
the
book
with
which
materialist
have
pester'd
<EOS>
the
world
ever
convince
me
to
the
contrary
.
  
<EOS>
maria

<EOS>
when
Maria
have
come
a
little
to
herself
,
I
ask'd
her
if
she
remember
a
pale
thin
person
of
a
man
,
who
have
sit
down
betwixt
her
and
her
goat
about
two
year
before
?
 
<EOS>
She
say
she
be
unsettle
much
at
that
time
,
but
remember
it
upon
two
account
:
   
<EOS>
-that
<EOS>
ill
as
she
be
<EOS>
,
she
see
the
person
pity
her
;
and
next
,
that
her
goat
have
steal
his
handkerchief
,
and
she
have
beat
him
for
the
theft
;
 
<EOS>
she
have
wash'd
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
,
she
say
,
in
the
brook
,
and
keep
it
ever
since
in
her
pocket
to
restore
it
to
him
in
case
she
should
ever
see
him
again
,
which
,
she
add
,
he
have
half
promise
her
.
 
<EOS>
as
she
tell
me
this
,
she
take
the
handkerchief
out
of
her
pocket
to
let
me
see
it
;
she
have
fold
it
up
neatly
in
a
couple
of
vine
leave
,
tie
round
with
a
tendril
;
 
on
open
it
<EOS>
,
I
see
an
S.
mark
in
one
of
the
corner
.
  
<EOS>
She
have
since
that
,
she
tell
me
,
stray'd
as
far
as
Rome
,
and
walk'd
round
<EOS>
St.
Peter
's
once
,
 
and
return'd
back
;
 
that
she
find
her
way
alone
across
the
Apennines
;
 
have
travell'd
over
all
Lombardy
,
without
money
,
 
and
through
the
flinty
road
of
Savoy
without
shoe
:
  
<EOS>
h
ow
she
have
bear
it
,
and
how
she
have
get
support
,
she
could
not
tell
;
 
but
GOD
temper
the
wind
,
say
Maria
,
to
the
SHORN
LAMB

<EOS>
shorn
indeed
!
<EOS>
and
to
the
quick

say
I
:
 
and
wast
thou
in
my
own
land
,
where
I
have
a
cottage
,
I
would
take
thee
to
it
,
and
shelter
thee
:
 
<EOS>
thou
shouldst
eat
of
my
own
bread
and
drink
of
my
own
cup
;
  
<EOS>
I
would
be
kind
to
thy
Sylvio
;
 
in
all
thy
weakness
and
wandering
<EOS>
I
would
seek
after
thee
and
bring
thee
back
;
 
when
the
sun
go
down
I
would
say
my
prayer
:
 
and
when
I
have
do
thou
shouldst
play
thy
evening
song
upon
thy
pipe
,
nor
would
the
incense
of
my
sacrifice
be
bad
accept

nature
melt
within
me

as
I
utter'd
this

and
Maria
observe
,
as
I
take
out
my
handkerchief
,
that
it
be
steep'd
too
much
already
to
be
of
use
,
would
needs
go
wash
it
in

<EOS>
and
where
will
you
dry
it
,
Maria

<EOS>
say
I.
 
I
will
dry
it
in

do
me
good

<EOS>
and
be
your
heart
still
so
warm
,
Maria

<EOS>
say
I.
  
I
touch'd
<EOS>
upon
the
string
on
which
hang
all
her
sorrow
:
  
<EOS>
s
he
look'd
<EOS>
with
wistful
disorder
for
some
time
in
my

and
then
,
without

any

,
take
her
pipe
and
play'd
<EOS>
her
service
to
the
Virgin

<EOS>
the

Maria

She

<EOS>

<EOS>
Maria
put
her

within
mine

and
lengthen
the
string
,
to
let
the

follow

I
stopp'd

Maria

a

something

feminine

so
much
be
there
about
her
of
all

the

wish

in
woman

that
could

those

Eliza
out

she
should
not
only
eat
of
my
BREAD

DRINK
of
my

but
Maria
should
lie
in
my

be
unto

Adieu

in

Touch'd

draw
my

I
languish
 
hear
my
tale

and
blame
the
weather
for
the

<EOS>
Thou
giv'st
<EOS>
a
portion

rough

traverse
the
bleakest
mountain

Peace

a

come
loose
from
the
fore
foot
of
the
thill

horse
,
at
the
beginning
of
the
ascent
of
mount
Taurira
,
the
postilion
dismount
,
twist
the
shoe
off
,
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
;
as
the
ascent
be
of
five
or
six
mile
,
and
that
horse
our
main
dependence
,
I
make
a
point
of
have
the
shoe
fasten
on
again
,
as
well
as
we
could
;
but
the
postilion
have
throw
away
the
nail
,
and
the
hammer
in
the
chaise
box
being
of
no
great
use
without
them
,
I
submit
to
go
on

He
have
not
mount
half
a

come

flinty
piece
of
road
,
the
poor
devil
lose
a
second
shoe
,
and
from
off
his
other
fore
foot
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
get
out
of
the
chaise
in
good
earnest
;
and
see
a
house
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
the
left
hand
,
<EOS>
with
a
great
deal
to
do
I
prevail
upon
the
postilion
to
turn
up
to
it
.
<EOS>
the
look
of
the
house
,
and
of
every
thing
about
it
,
as
we
draw
near
,
soon
reconcile
me
to
the
disaster
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
little
farm
-
house
,
surround
with
about
twenty
acre
of
vineyard
,
about
as
much
corn
;
 
and
close
to
the
house
,
on
one
side
,
<EOS>
be
a
potagerie
of
an
acre
and
a
half
,
full
of
everything
which
could
make
plenty
in
a
french
peasant
's
house
;
 
and
,
on
the
other
side
,
be
a
little
wood
,
which
furnish
wherewithal
to
dress
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
about
eight
in
the
evening
when
I
get
to
the
house
 
<EOS>
so
I
leave
the
postilion
to
manage
his
point
as
he
could
;
 
and
,
for
mine
,
I
walk
directly
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
family
consist
of
an
old
grey
-
head
man
and
his
wife
,
with
five
or
six
son
and
son
-
in

law
,
and
their
several
wife
,
and
a
joyous
genealogy
out
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
all
sit
down
together
to
their
lentil
-
soup
;
a
large
wheaten
loaf
be
in
the
middle
of
the
table
;
and
a
flagon
of
wine
at
each
end
of
it
promise
joy
through
the
stage
of
the
repast
:
   
<EOS>
'
twas
a
feast
of
love

<EOS>
the
old
man
rise
up
to
meet
me
,
and
with
a
respectful
cordiality
would
have
me
sit
down
at
the
table
;
my
heart
be
set
down
the
moment
<EOS>
I
enter'd
<EOS>
the
room
;
so
I
sit
down
at
once
like
a
son
of
the
family
;
and
to
invest
myself
in
the
character
as
speedily
as
I
could
,
I
instantly
borrow
the
old
man
's
knife
,
and
take
up
the
loaf
,
cut
myself
a
hearty
luncheon
;
and
,
as
I
do
it
,
I
see
a
testimony
in
every
eye
,
not
only
of
an
honest
welcome
,
but
of
a
welcome
mix'd
with
thank
that
I
have
not
seem'd
to
doubt
it
.
  
<EOS>
be
it
this
?
<EOS>
or
tell
me
,
Nature
,
what
else
it
be
that
make
this
morsel
so
sweet
,
 
and
to
what
magic
<EOS>
I
owe
it
,
that
the
draught
I
take
of
their
flagon
be
so
delicious
with
it
,
that
they
remain
upon
my
palate
to
this
hour
?
  
<EOS>
if
the
supper
be
to
my
taste
,
 
the
grace
which
follow
it
be
much
more
so
.
  
<EOS>
the
grace
.
  
<EOS>
when
supper
be
over
,
the
old
man
give
a
knock
upon
the
table
with
the
haft
of
his
knife
,
to
bid
them
prepare
for
the
dance
:
 
<EOS>
the
moment
the
signal
be
give
,
the
woman
and
girl
run
altogether
into
a
back
apartment
to
tie
up
their
hair
,
 
and
the
young
man
to
the
door
to
wash
their
face
,
and
change
their
sabot
;
and
in
three
minute
every
soul
be
ready
upon
a
little
esplanade
before
the
house
to
begin
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
man
and
his
wife
come
out
last
,
and
place
me
betwixt
them
,
sit
down
upon
a
sofa
of
turf
by
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
man
have
some
fifty
year
ago
be
no
mean
performer
upon
the
vielle
,
 
and
at
the
age
he
be
then
of
,
touch'd
<EOS>
it
well
enough
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
His
wife
sing
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
little
to
the
tune
,
  
<EOS>
-then
intermit
,
 
and
join'd
<EOS>
her
old
man
again
,
as
their
child
and
grand
-
child
dance
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
till
the
middle
of
the
second
dance
,
when
,
from
some
pause
in
the
movement
,
wherein
they
all
seem
to
look
up
,
I
fancy
I
could
distinguish
an
elevation
of
spirit
different
from
that
which
be
the
cause
or
the
effect
of
simple
jollity
.
 
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
I
think
I
beheld
Religion
mix
in
the
dance
:
  
<EOS>
b
<EOS>
ut
,
as
I
have
never
see
her
so
engaged
,
I
should
have
look'd
<EOS>
upon
it
now
as
one
of
the
illusion
of
an
imagination
which
be
eternally
mislead
me
,
have
not
the
old
man
,
as
soon
as
the
dance
end
,
say
,
that
this
be
their
constant
way
;
and
that
all
his
life
long
<EOS>
he
have
make
it
a
rule
,
after
supper
be
over
,
to
call
out
his
family
to
dance
and
rejoice
;
believe
,
he
say
,
that
a
cheerful
and
contented
mind
be
the
good
sort
of
thank
to
heaven
that
an
illiterate
peasant
could
pay
,
     
or
a
learned
prelate
either

DELICACY

<EOS>
when
you
have
gain
the

Mount
Taurira
,
you
run
presently
down
to
lyon

then

<EOS>
'
Tis
a
journey
of
caution
;
and
it
fare
better
with
sentiment
,
not
to
be
in
a
hurry
with
them
;
so
I
contract
with
a
voiturin
to
take
his
time
with
a
couple
of
mule
,
and
convoy
me
in
my
own
chaise
safe
to
Turin

through
Savoy

<EOS>
poor

patient

quiet

honest
people

<EOS>
fear
not
:
 
your
poverty
,
the
treasury
of
your
simple
virtue

will
not
be
envy
you
by
the

nor
will
your

<EOS>
Nature

<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
thy
disorder

thou
art
still
friendly

the
scantiness
thou

with

thy
great
work
about

,
little
hast
thou
leave
to
give

either
to
the
scythe
or
to

but
to
that
little

grantest
safety

<EOS>
let

vent
his
complaint
upon
the
sudden
turn
and
danger
of
your
road
,
 
<EOS>
your
rock
,
 
your
precipice
;
  
the
difficulty
of
get
up
,
 
the
horror
of
get
down

mountain
impracticable
,
 
and
cataract
,
which
roll
down
great
stone
from
their
summit
,
and
block
his
road
up
.
 
<EOS>
the
peasant
have
be
all
day
at
work
in
remove
a
fragment
of
this
kind
between
St.
Michael
and
Madane
;
and
,
by
the
time
my
voiturin
get
to
the
place
,
it
want
full
two
hour
of
complete
before
a
passage
could
any
how
be
gain'd
:
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
but
to
wait
with
patience
;
 
'
twas
a
wet
and
tempestuous
night
;
so
that
by
the
delay
,
and
that
together
,
the
voiturin
find
himself
oblige
to
put
up
five
mile
short
of
his
stage
at
a
little
decent
kind
of
an
inn
by
the
roadside
.
  
<EOS>
I
forthwith
take
possession
of
my
bedchamber
 
<EOS>
get
a
good
fire
 
<EOS>
order'd
supper
;
and
be
thank
heaven
<EOS>
it
be
no
bad
,
when
a
voiture
arrive
with
a
lady
in
it
and
her
servant
maid
.
  
<EOS>
as
there
be
no
other
bed
-
chamber
in
the
house
,
the
hostess
,
  
without
much
nicety
,
lead
them
into
mine
,
tell
them
,
as
she
usher'd
<EOS>
them
in
,
that
there
be
nobody
in
it
but
an
english
gentleman
;
 
that
there
be
two
good
bed
in
it
,
and
a
closet
within
the
room
which
hold
another
.
 
<EOS>
the
accent
in
which
she
speak
of
this
third
bed
,
do
not
say
much
for
it
;
 
however
,
she
say
there
be
three
bed
<EOS>
and
<EOS>
but
three
people
,
and
<EOS>
she
durst
say
,
the
gentleman
would
do
anything
to
accommodate
matter
.
 
<EOS>
I
leave
not
the
lady
a
moment
to
make
a
conjecture
about
it
 
so
instantly
make
a
declaration
that
I
would
do
anything
in
my
power
.
  
<EOS>
as
this
do
not
amount
to
an
absolute
surrender
of
my
bed
-
chamber
,
I
still
feel
myself
so
much
the
proprietor
,
as
to
have
a
right
to
do
the
honour
of
it
;
 
<EOS>
so
I
desire
the
lady
to
sit
down
,
 
press
her
into
the
warm
seat
,
 
call
for
more
wood
,
 
desire
the
hostess
to
enlarge
the
plan
of
the
supper
,
and
to
favour
us
with
the
very
good
wine
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
have
scarce
warm'd
herself
five
minute
at
the
fire
,
before
she
begin
to
turn
her
head
back
,
and
give
a
look
at
the
bed
;
and
the
oftener
she
cast
her
eye
that
way
,
the
more
they
return'd
perplexd
;
 
<EOS>
I
feel
for
her
 
and
for
myself
:
 
for
in
a
few
minute
<EOS>
,
what
by
her
look
,
and
the
case
itself
,
I
find
myself
as
much
embarrassed
as
it
be
possible
the
lady
could
be
herself
.
  
<EOS>
that
the
bed
we
be
to
lie
in
be
in
one
and
the
same
room
,
be
enough
simply
by
itself
to
have
excite
all
this
;
 
but
the
position
of
them
,
for
they
stand
parallel
,
and
so
very
close
to
each
other
as
only
to
allow
space
for
a
small
wicker
chair
betwixt
them
,
render
the
affair
still
more
oppressive
to
us
;
 
they
be
fix
up
moreover
near
the
fire
;
and
the
projection
of
the
chimney
on
one
side
,
and
a
large
beam
<EOS>
which
cross'd
<EOS>
the
room
on
the
other
,
form
a
kind
of
recess
for
them
that
be
no
way
favourable
to
the
nicety
of
our
sensation
:
  
<EOS>
i
f
<EOS>
anything
could
have
add
to
it
<EOS>
,
it
be
that
the
two
bed
be
both
of
them
so
very
small
,
as
to
cut
us
off
from
every
idea
of
the
lady
and
the
maid
lie
together
;
which
in
either
of
them
,
could
it
have
be
feasible
,
my
lying
beside
them
,
though
a
thing
not
to
be
wish'd
,
yet
there
be
nothing
in
it
<EOS>
so
terrible
which
the
imagination
may
not
have
pass'd
over
without
torment
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
the
little
room
within
,
it
offer'd
<EOS>
little
or
no
consolation
to
us
:
 
'
twas
a
damp
,
cold
closet
,
with
a
half
dismantle
window
-
shutter
,
and
with
a
window
which
have
neither
glass
nor
oil
paper
in
it
to
keep
out
the
temp
of
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
endeavour
to
stifle
my
cough
when
the
lady
give
a
peep
into
it
;
so
it
reduce
the
case
in
course
to
this
alternative
 
<EOS>
that
the
lady
should
sacrifice
her
health
to
her
feeling
,
and
take
up
with
the
closet
herself
,
and
abandon
the
bed
next
mine
to
her
maid
,
 
or
that
the
girl
should
take
the
closet
,
&
c.
,
&
c.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
be
a
Piedmontese
of
about
thirty
,
with
a
glow
of
health
in
her
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
the
maid
be
a
Lyonoise
of
twenty
,
and
as
brisk
and
lively
a
french
girl
as
ever
move
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
difficulty
every
way
,
 
and
the
obstacle
of
the
stone
in
the
road
,
which
bring
us
into
the
distress
,
great
as
it
appear
whilst
the
peasant
be
remove
it
,
be
but
a
pebble
to
what
lie
in
our
way
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
to
add
,
that
it
do
not
lessen
the
weight
which
hang
upon
our
spirit
,
that
we
be
both
too
delicate
to
communicate
what
we
feel
to
each
other
upon
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
We
sit
down
to
supper
;
and
have
we
not
have
more
generous
wine
to
it
than
a
little
inn
in
Savoy
could
have
furnish'd
,
our
tongue
have
be
tie
up
,
till
necessity
herself
have
set
them
at
liberty
;
 
but
the
lady
have
a
few
bottle
of
Burgundy
in
her
voiture
,
send
down
her
fille
de
chambre
for
a
couple
of
them
;
so
that
by
the
time
supper
be
over
,
and
we
be
leave
alone
<EOS>
,
we
feel
ourselves
inspire
with
a
strength
of
mind
sufficient
to
talk
,
at
least
,
without
reserve
upon
our
situation
.
 
<EOS>
We
turn'd
<EOS>
it
every
way
,
and
debate
and
consider
it
in
all
kind
of
light
in
the
course
of
a
two
hour
'
negotiation
;
at
the
end
of
which
the
article
be
settle
finally
betwixt
us
,
and
stipulate
for
in
form
and
manner
of
a
treaty
of
peace
,
 
and
I
believe
with
as
much
religion
and
good
faith
on
both
side
as
in
any
treaty
which
have
yet
have
the
honour
of
be
hand
down
to
posterity
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
as
follow
:
      
<EOS>
First
,
as
the
right
of
the
bed
-
chamber
be
in
Monsieur
,
 
and
he
think
the
bed
next
to
the
fire
to
be
the
warm
,
he
insist
upon
the
concession
on
the
lady
's
side
of
take
up
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
grant
,
on
the
part
of
Madame
;
with
a
proviso
,
that
as
the
curtain
of
that
bed
be
of
a
flimsy
transparent
cotton
,
and
appear
likewise
too
scanty
to
draw
close
,
that
the
fille
de
chambre
shall
fasten
up
the
opening
,
either
by
cork
pin
,
or
needle
and
thread
,
in
such
manner
as
shall
be
deem'd
a
sufficient
barrier
on
the
side
of
Monsieur
.
  
<EOS>
2dly
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
require
on
the
part
of
Madame
,
that
Monsieur
shall
lie
the
whole
night
through
in
his
robe
de
chambre
.
  
<EOS>
reject
:
 
inasmuch
as
Monsieur
be
not
worth
a
robe
de
chambre
<EOS>
;
he
have
nothing
in
his
portmanteau
but
six
shirt
and
a
black
silk
pair
of
breech
.
  
<EOS>
the
mention
the
silk
pair
of
breech
make
an
entire
change
of
the
article
,
 
for
the
breech
be
accept
as
an
equivalent
for
the
robe
de
chambre
;
and
so
it
be
stipulate
and
agree
upon
,
that
I
should
lie
in
my
black
silk
breech
all
night
.
  
<EOS>
3dly
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
insist
upon
and
stipulate
for
by
the
lady
,
that
after
Monsieur
be
get
to
bed
,
and
the
candle
and
fire
extinguish
,
that
Monsieur
should
not
speak
one
single
word
the
whole
night
.
  
<EOS>
grant
;
provide
Monsieur
's
say
his
prayer
may
not
be
deem
an
infraction
of
the
treaty
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
but
one
point
forget
in
this
treaty
,
and
that
be
the
manner
in
which
the
lady
and
myself
should
be
oblige
to
undress
and
get
to
bed
;
 
there
be
but
one
way
of
do
it
,
and
that
I
leave
to
the
reader
to
devise
;
protest
as
I
do
it
,
that
if
it
be
not
the
most
delicate
in
nature
,
'
tis
the
fault
of
his
own
imagination
,
 
against
which
this
be
not
my
first
complaint
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
when
we
be
get
to
bed
,
whether
it
be
the
novelty
of
the
situation
,
or
what
it
be
,
I
know
not
;
but
so
it
be
,
<EOS>
I
could
not
shut
my
eye
;
I
try
this
side
,
and
that
,
and
turn'd
and
turn'd
again
,
till
a
full
hour
after
midnight
;
when
nature
and
patience
both
wear
out
,
 
o
,
my
God
!
say
I.
     
You
have
break
the
treaty
,
Monsieur
,
say
the
lady
,
who
have
no
more
slept
than
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
begg'd
<EOS>
a
thousand
pardon
 
<EOS>
but
insist
it
be
no
more
than
an
ejaculation
.
 
<EOS>
She
maintain
'
twa
an
entire
infraction
of
the
treaty
 
I
maintain
it
be
provide
for
in
the
clause
of
the
third
article
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
would
by
no
mean
give
up
her
point
,
though
she
weaken'd
<EOS>
her
barrier
by
it
;
for
in
the
warmth
of
the
dispute
,
I
could
hear
two
or
three
cork
pin
fall
out
of
the
curtain
to
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
upon
my
word
and
honour
,
Madame
,
say
I
,
 
stretch
my
arm
out
of
bed
by
way
of
asseveration
.
     
<EOS>
(
I
be
go
to
have
add
,
that
I
would
not
have
trespass
against
the
remote
idea
of
decorum
for
the
world
)
;
     
<EOS>
but
the
fille
de
chambre
hearing
<EOS>
there
be
word
between
us
,
and
fear
that
hostility
would
ensue
in
course
,
have
creep
silently
out
of
her
closet
,
and
it
be
totally
dark
,
have
steal
so
close
to
our
bed
,
that
she
have
get
herself
into
the
narrow
passage
which
separate
them
,
and
have
advance
so
far
up
as
to
be
in
a
line
betwixt
her
mistress
and
me
:
      
<EOS>
so
that
when
I
<EOS>
stretch'd
out
my
hand
<EOS>
I
catch
hold
of
the
fille
de
chambre
's
    
<EOS>
