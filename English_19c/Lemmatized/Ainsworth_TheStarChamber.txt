I.The
three
Cranes
in
the
Vintry
.
<EOS>
adjoin
the
Vintry
Wharf
,
and
at
the
corner
of
a
narrow
lane
communicate
with
Thames
Street
,
there
stand
,
in
the
early
part
of
the
Seventeenth
Century
,
a
tavern
call
the
Three
Cranes
.
<EOS>
this
old
and
renowned
place
of
entertainment
have
then
be
in
existence
more
than
two
hundred
year
,
though
under
other
designation
.
<EOS>
in
the
reign
of
Richard
II
.
,
when
it
be
first
establish
,
it
be
style
the
Painted
Tavern
,
from
the
circumstance
of
its
outer
wall
be
fancifully
colour
and
adorn
with
bacchanalian
device
.
<EOS>
but
these
decoration
go
out
of
fashion
in
time
,
and
the
tavern
,
somewhat
change
its
external
feature
,
though
preserve
all
its
internal
comfort
and
accommodation
,
assume
the
name
of
the
Three
Crowns
,
under
which
title
it
continue
until
the
accession
of
Elizabeth
,
when
it
become
(
by
a
slight
modification
)
<EOS>
the
Three
Cranes
;
and
so
remain
in
the
day
of
her
successor
,
and
,
indeed
,
long
afterwards
.
<EOS>
not
that
the
last
-
adopt
denomination
have
any
reference
,
as
may
be
suppose
,
to
the
three
huge
wooden
instrument
on
the
wharf
,
employ
with
rope
and
pulley
to
unload
the
lighter
and
other
vessel
that
bring
up
butts
and
hogshead
of
wine
from
the
large
craft
below
Bridge
,
and
constantly
throng
the
bank
;
though
,
no
doubt
,
they
indirectly
suggest
it
.
<EOS>
the
Three
Cranes
depict
on
the
large
signboard
,
suspend
in
front
of
the
tavern
,
be
long
-
necked
,
long
-
beak
bird
,
each
with
a
golden
fish
in
its
bill
.
<EOS>
but
under
whatever
designation
it
may
be
know
—
Crown
or
Crane
—
the
tavern
have
always
maintain
a
high
reputation
for
excellence
of
wine
:
and
this
be
the
less
surprising
when
we
take
into
account
its
close
proximity
to
the
vast
vault
and
cellar
of
the
Vintry
,
where
the
choice
produce
of
Gascony
,
Bordeaux
,
and
other
wine
-
grow
district
,
be
deposit
;
some
of
which
we
may
reasonably
conclude
would
find
its
way
to
its
table
.
<EOS>
good
wine
,
it
may
be
incidentally
remark
,
be
cheap
enough
when
the
Three
Cranes
be
first
open
,
the
delicate
juice
of
the
Gascoign
grape
be
then
vend
,
at
fourpence
the
gallon
,
and
Rhenish
at
sixpence
!
<EOS>
price
,
however
,
have
rise
considerably
at
the
period
of
which
we
propose
to
treat
;
but
the
tavern
be
as
well
-
repute
and
well
-
frequent
as
ever
:
even
more
so
,
for
it
have
considerably
advance
in
estimation
since
it
come
into
the
hand
of
a
certain
enterprising
french
skipper
,
Prosper
Bonaventure
by
name
,
who
intrust
its
management
to
his
active
and
pretty
little
wife
Dameris
,
while
he
himself
prosecute
his
trading
voyage
between
the
Garonne
and
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
and
very
well
Madame
Bonaventure
fulfil
the
duty
of
hostess
,
as
will
be
see
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
the
skipper
be
a
very
sharp
fellow
,
and
perfectly
understand
his
business
-
practically
anticipate
the
transatlantic
axiom
of
buy
at
the
cheap
market
and
gel
at
the
dear
-
he
soon
contrive
to
grow
rich
.
<EOS>
He
do
more
:
he
please
his
customer
at
the
Three
Cranes
.
<EOS>
take
care
to
select
his
wine
judiciously
,
and
have
good
opportunity
,
he
manage
to
obtain
possession
of
some
delicious
vintage
,
which
,
could
not
be
match
elsewhere
;
and
,
with
this
nectar
at
his
command
,
the
fortune
of
his
house
be
make
.
<EOS>
all
the
town
gallant
flock
to
the
Three
Cranes
to
dine
at
the
admirable
french
ordinary
newly
establish
there
,
and
crush
a
flask
or
so
of
the
exquisite
Bordeaux
,
about
which
,
and
its
delicate
flavour
and
bouquet
,
all
the
connoisseur
in
claret
be
rave
.
<EOS>
from
,
mid
-
day
,
therefore
,
till
late
in
the
afternoon
,
there
be
nearly
as
many
gay
barge
and
wherry
as
lighter
lie
off
the
Vintry
Wharf
;
and
sometimes
,
when
accommodation
be
want
,
the
little
craft
be
moor
along
the
shore
all
the
way
from
Queenhithe
to
the
Steelyard
;
at
which
latter
place
the
Catherine
Wheel
be
almost
as
much
note
for
racy
rhenish
and
high
-
dry
neat
's
tongue
,
as
our
tavern
be
for
fine
Bordeaux
and
well
-
season
pâtés
.
<EOS>
not
the
least
,
however
,
of
the
attraction
of
the
Three
Cranes
,
be
the
hostess
herself
.
<EOS>
a
lively
little
brunette
be
Madame
Bonaventure
,
still
young
,
or
,
at
all
event
,
very
far
from
be
old
;
with
extremely
fine
tooth
,
which
she
be
fond
of
displaying
,
and
a
remarkably
neat
ancle
,
which
she
feel
no
inclination
to
hide
beneath
the
sweep
of
her
round
circle
farthingale
.
<EOS>
Her
figure
be
quite
that
of
a
miniature
Venus
;
and
as
,
like
most
of
her
country
<EOS>
-
woman
,
she
understand
the
art
of
dress
to
admiration
,
she
set
off
her
person
to
the
good
advantage
;
always
attire
herself
in
a
style
,
and
in
colour
,
that
suit
her
,
and
never
indulge
in
an
unwarrantable
extravagance
of
ruff
,
or
absurd
and
unbecoming
length
of
peaked
boddice
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
stuff
she
wear
,
they
be
certainly
above
her
station
,
for
no
Court
dame
could
boast
of
rich
silk
than
those
in
which
the
pretty
Dameris
appear
on
fête
day
;
and
this
be
account
for
by
reason
that
the
good
skipper
seldom
return
from
a
trip
to
France
without
bring
his
wife
a
piece
of
silk
,
brocade
,
or
velvet
from
Lyons
;
or
some
little
matter
from
Paris
,
such
as
a
ruff
,
cuff
,
partlet
,
bandlet
,
or
fillet
.
<EOS>
thus
the
last
french
mode
may
be
see
at
the
Three
Crowns
,
display
by
the
hostess
,
as
well
as
the
last
french
entremet
at
its
table
;
since
,
among
other
important
accessory
to
the
well
-
doing
of
the
house
,
Madame
Bonaventure
keep
a
chef
de
cuisine
—
one
of
her
compatriot
—
of
such
superlative
skill
,
that
in
later
time
he
must
infallibly
have
be
distinguish
as
a
cordon
bleu
.
<EOS>
but
not
have
yet
complete
our
description
of
the
charming
Bordelaise
we
must
add
that
she
possess
a
rich
southern
complexion
,
fine
sparkling
black
eye
,
shade
by
long
dark
eye
-
lash
,
and
over
-
arch
by
jetty
brow
,
and
that
her
raven
hair
be
comb
back
and
gather
in
a
large
roll
over
her
smooth
forehead
,
which
have
the
five
point
of
beauty
complete
.
<EOS>
over
this
she
wear
a
prettily
-
conceive
coif
,
with
a
frontlet
.
<EOS>
a
well
-
starched
,
well
-
plait
ruff
encomposse
her
throat
.
<EOS>
Her
upper
lip
be
darken
,
but
in
the
slight
degree
,
by
down
like
the
soft
silk
;
and
this
peculiarity
(
a
peculiarity
it
would
be
in
an
Englishwoman
,
though
frequently
observable
in
the
beauty
of
the
South
of
France
)
lend
additional
piquancy
and
z
to
her
charm
in
the
eye
of
her
numerous
adorer
.
<EOS>
Her
ankle
we
have
say
be
trim
;
and
it
may
be
add
that
they
be
oftener
display
in
an
embroidered
french
velvet
shoe
than
in
one
of
spanish
leather
;
while
in
walk
out
she
increase
her
stature
"
by
the
altitude
of
a
chopine
.
<EOS>
"captain
<EOS>
Bonaventure
be
by
no
means
jealous
;
and
even
if
he
have
be
,
it
would
have
matter
little
,
since
he
be
so
constantly
away
.
<EOS>
fancy
,
therefore
,
she
have
some
of
the
privilege
of
a
widow
,
our
lively
Dameris
flirt
a
good
deal
with
the
gay
and
handsome
of
the
galliard
frequent
her
house
.
<EOS>
but
she
know
where
to
stop
;
no
licence
or
indecorum
be
ever
permit
at
the
Three
Cranes
;
and
that
be
say
a
great
deal
in
favour
of
the
hostess
,
when
the
dissolute
character
of
the
age
be
take
into
consideration
.
<EOS>
besides
this
,
Cyprien
,
a
stout
well
-
favour
young
Gascon
,
who
fill
the
post
of
drawer
and
chamberlain
,
together
with
two
or
three
other
trencher
-
scraper
,
who
serve
at
table
,
and
wait
on
the
guest
,
be
generally
sufficient
to
clear
the
house
of
any
troublesome
roysterer
.
<EOS>
thus
the
reputation
of
the
Three
Cranes
be
unblemished
,
in
spite
of
the
liveliness
and
coquetry
of
its
mistress
;
and
in
spite
,
also
,
of
the
malicious
tongue
of
rival
tavern
-
keeper
,
which
be
loud
against
it
.
<EOS>
a
pretty
woman
be
sure
to
have
enemy
and
calumniator
,
and
Madame
Bonaventure
have
more
than
enow
;
but
she
think
very
little
about
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
one
point
,
however
,
on
which
it
behove
her
to
be
careful
:
and
extremely
careful
she
was,—not
leave
a
single
loop
-
hole
for
censure
or
attack
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
question
of
religion
.
<EOS>
on
first
take
the
house
,
Madame
Bonaventure
give
it
out
that
she
and
the
skipper
be
Huguenots
,
descend
from
family
who
have
suffer
much
persecution
during
the
time
of
the
League
,
for
staunch
adherence
to
their
faith
;
and
the
statement
be
generally
credit
,
though
there
be
some
who
profess
to
doubt
it
.
<EOS>
certain
it
be
,
our
hostess
do
not
wear
any
cross
,
bead
,
or
other
outward
symbol
of
Papacy
.
<EOS>
and
though
this
may
count
for
little
,
it
be
never
discover
that
she
attend
mass
in
secret
.
<EOS>
Her
movement
be
watch
,
but
without
anything
come
to
light
that
have
reference
to
religious
observance
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
those
who
try
to
trace
her
,
find
that
her
visit
be
mostly
pay
to
Paris
Garden
,
the
Rose
,
and
the
Globe
(
where
our
immortal
bard
's
play
be
then
be
perform
)
,
or
some
other
place
of
amusement
;
and
if
she
do
go
on
the
river
at
time
,
it
be
merely
upon
a
party
of
pleasure
,
accompany
by
gay
gallant
in
velvet
cloak
and
silken
doublet
,
and
by
light
-
hearted
dame
like
herself
,
and
not
by
notorious
plotter
or
sour
priest
.
<EOS>
still
,
as
many
Bordeaux
merchant
frequent
the
house
,
as
well
as
trader
from
the
hanse
town
,
and
other
foreigner
,
it
be
look
upon
by
the
suspicious
as
a
hotbed
of
romish
heresy
and
treason
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
these
maligner
affirm
that
english
recusant
,
as
well
as
seminary
priest
from
abroad
,
have
be
harbour
there
,
and
clandestinely
spirit
away
from
the
pursuit
of
justice
by
the
skipper
;
but
the
charge
be
never
substantiate
,
and
could
,
therefore
,
only
proceed
from
envy
and
malice
.
<EOS>
whatever
Madame
Bonaventure
's
religious
opinion
may
be
,
she
keep
her
own
council
so
well
that
no
one
ever
find
them
out
.
<EOS>
but
evil
day
be
at
hand
.
<EOS>
hitherto
,
all
have
be
smile
and
prosperous
.
<EOS>
the
prospect
now
begin
to
darken
.
<EOS>
within
the
last
twelve
month
a
strange
and
unlooked
for
interference
have
take
place
with
our
hostess
's
profit
,
which
she
have
view
,
at
first
,
without
much
anxiety
,
because
she
do
not
clearly
comprehend
its
scope
;
but
latterly
,
as
its
formidable
character
become
reveal
,
it
begin
to
fill
her
with
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
the
calamity
,
as
she
naturally
enough
regard
it
,
arise
in
the
follow
manner
.
<EOS>
the
present
be
an
age
of
monopoly
and
patent
,
grant
by
a
crown
ever
eager
to
obtain
money
under
any
pretext
,
however
unjustifiable
and
iniquitous
,
provide
it
be
plausibly
coloured
;
and
these
vexatious
privilege
be
purchase
by
greedy
and
unscrupulous
person
for
the
purpose
of
turn
them
into
instrument
of
extortion
and
wrong
.
<EOS>
though
various
branch
of
trade
and
industry
groan
under
the
oppression
inflict
upon
them
,
there
be
no
means
of
redress
.
<EOS>
the
patentee
enjoy
perfect
immunity
,
grind
them
down
as
they
please
,
farm
out
whole
district
,
and
divide
the
spoil
.
<EOS>
Their
miserable
victim
dare
scarcely
murmur
;
have
ever
the
terrible
court
of
Star
-
Chamber
before
them
,
which
their
persecutor
could
command
,
and
which
punish
libeller
—
as
they
would
be
account
,
if
they
give
utterance
to
their
wrong
,
and
charge
their
oppressor
with
mis
-
doing,—with
fine
,
brand
,
and
the
pillory
.
<EOS>
many
be
handle
in
this
sort
,
and
hold
up
in
terrorem
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
hence
it
come
to
pass
,
that
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
from
the
fearful
nature
of
its
machinery
;
its
extraordinary
power
;
the
notorious
corruption
and
venality
of
its
officer
;
the
peculiarity
of
its
practice
,
which
always
favour
the
plaintiff
;
and
the
severity
with
which
it
punish
any
libelling
or
slanderous
word
utter
against
the
king
's
representative
(
as
the
patentee
be
consider
)
,
or
any
conspiracy
or
false
accusation
bring
against
them
;
it
come
to
pass
,
we
say
,
that
this
terrible
court
become
as
much
dread
in
Protestant
England
as
the
Inquisition
in
Catholic
Spain
.
<EOS>
the
punishment
inflict
by
the
Star
-
Chamber
be
,
as
we
learn
from
a
legal
authority
,
and
a
counsel
in
the
court
,
"
fine
,
imprisonment
,
loss
of
ear
,
or
nail
to
the
pillory
,
slit
the
nose
,
brand
the
forehead
,
whip
of
late
day
,
wear
of
paper
in
public
place
,
or
any
punishment
but
death
.
"
<EOS>
and
John
Chamberlain
,
Esq
.
,
write
to
Sir
Dudley
Carlton
,
about
the
same
period
,
observe
,
that
"
the
world
be
now
much
terrified
with
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
there
be
not
so
little
an
offence
against
any
proclamation
,
but
be
liable
and
subject
to
the
censure
of
that
court
.
<EOS>
and
for
proclamation
and
patent
,
they
be
become
so
ordinary
that
there
be
no
end
;
every
day
bring
forth
some
new
project
or
other
.
<EOS>
as
,
within
these
two
day
,
here
be
one
come
forth
for
tobacco
,
wholly
engross
by
Sir
Thomas
Roe
and
his
partner
,
which
,
if
they
can
keep
and
maintain
against
the
general
clamour
,
will
be
a
great
commodity
;
unless
,
peradventure
,
indignation
,
rather
than
all
other
reason
,
may
bring
that
filthy
weed
out
of
use
.
"
<EOS>
[
what
,
would
be
the
effect
of
such
a
patent
now
-
a
-
day
?
<EOS>
Would
it
,
at
all
,
restrict
the
use
of
the
"
filthy
weed
?
"
]
<EOS>
"
in
truth
,
"
proceed
Chamberlain
,
"
the
world
doth
even
groan
under
the
burthen
of
these
perpetual
patent
,
which
be
become
so
frequent
,
that
whereas
at
the
king
's
come
in
there
be
complaint
of
some
eight
or
nine
monopoly
then
in
be
<EOS>
,
they
be
now
say
to
be
multiply
to
as

"From

<EOS>
amongst
those
who
have
obtain
the
large
share
of
spoil
be
two
person
destine
to
occupy
a
prominent
position
in
our
history
.
<EOS>
They
be
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
and
Sir
Francis
<EOS>
Mitchell,—both
name
hold
in
general
dread
and
detestation
,
though
no
man
venture
to
speak
ill
of
them
openly
,
since
they
be
as
implacable
in
their
animosity
,
as
usurious
and
gripe
in
their
demand

and
many
an
ear
have
be
lose
,
many
a
nose
slit
,
many
a
back
scourge
at
the
cart
's
tail
,
because
the
unfortunate
owner
have
stigmatize
them
accord
to
their
desert
.
<EOS>
thus
they
enjoy
a
complete
immunity
of
wrong
;
and
,
with
the
terrible
court
of
Star
-
Chamber
to
defend
them
and
to
punish
their
enemy
,
they
set
all
opposition
at
defiance
.
<EOS>
insatiable
as
unscrupulous
,
this
avaricious
pair
be
ever
on
the
alert
to
devise
new
mean
of
exaction
and
plunder
,
and
amongst
the
late
and
most
productive
of
their
invention
be
three
patent
,
which
they
have
obtain
through
the
instrumentality
of
Sir
Edward
Villiers
(
half

brother
of
the
ruling
favourite

the
Marquess
of

for

-
money
,
of
course,—for
the
licensing
of
ale
-
house
the
inspection
of
inn
and
hostelry
,
and
the
exclusive
manufacture
of
gold
and
silver
thread
.
<EOS>
It
be
with
the
two
former
of
these
that
we
have
now
to
deal
;
inasmuch
as
it
be
their
mischievous
operation
that
affect
Madame
Bonaventure
so
prejudicially
;
and
this
we
shall
more
fully
explain
,
as
it
will
serve
to
show
the
working
of
a
frightful
system
of
extortion
and
injustice
happily
no
longer
in
existence

<EOS>
by
the
sweeping
power
confer
upon
them

follow
the
refusal

however
excessive
;

most
person
prefer
the
remote
possibility
of
ruin
,
with
the
chance
of
avert
it
by
ready
submission
,
to
the
positive

Fearful
be

havoc
occasion
by
these
licensed
depredator
,
yet
no
one
dare
to
check
them
—
no

<EOS>
They

them

<EOS>

they

<EOS>
the

it

would
not
desist
from
drain
the
life

current
from
the
vein
of

victim

remain

<EOS>
and
they
be
well

in
their
iniquitous
task,—for
the
plain
reason
that
they
pay
their
agent

well

<EOS>
they

none

the

indeed
some

the

no

CHAPTER
II.Sir
Giles
Mompesson
and
His
Partner
.
<EOS>
Madame
Bonaventure
have
already
pay
considerable
sum
to
the
two
extortioner
,
but
she
resist
their
last
application
;
in
consequence
of
which
she
receive
a
monition
from
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
,
to
the
effect
that
,
in
a
month
's
time
,
her
license
would
be
withdraw
,
and
her
house
shut
up
,
unless
,
in
the
interim
,
she
consent
to
make
amend
to
himself
and
his
co
-
patentee
,
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
,
by
payment
of
the
sum
in
question
,
together
with
a
further
sum
,
equal
to
it
in
amount
,
by
way
of
forfeit
;
thus
double
the
original
demand
.
<EOS>
Our
pretty
hostess
,
it
would
seem
,
have
place
herself
in
an
awkward
predicament
by
her
temerity
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
be
not
a
man
to
threaten
idly
,
as
all
who
have
incur
his
displeasure
experience
to
their
cost
.
<EOS>
His
plan
be
to
make
himself
fear
;
and
he
be
inexorable
,
as
fate
itself
,
to
a
creditor
.
<EOS>
He
ever
exact
the
full
penalty
of
his
bond
.
<EOS>
in
this
instance
,
accord
to
his
own
notion
,
he
have
act
with
great
leniency
;
and
certainly
,
judge
by
his
customary
mode
of
proceed
in
such
case
,
he
have
show
some
little
indulgence
.
<EOS>
in
this
line
of
conduct
he
have
be
mainly
influence
by
his
partner
,
who
,
not
be
insensible
to
the
attraction
of
the
fair
hostess
,
hope
to
win
her
favour
by
a
show
of
consideration
.
<EOS>
but
though
Madame
Bonaventure
be
willing
enough
,
for
her
own
purpose
,
to
encourage
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
's
attention
<EOS>
(
she
detest
him
in
her
secret
heart
)
,
she
by
no
mean
rely
upon
him
for
security
.
<EOS>
a
more
powerful
friend
be
hold
in
reserve
,
whom
she
mean
to
produce
at
the
last
moment
;
and
,
consequently
,
she
be
not
so
ill
at
ease
as
she
otherwise
would
have
be
,
though
by
no
mean
free
from
misgive
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
be
a
terrible
enemy
,
and
seldom
thwart
in
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
that
she
know
.
<EOS>
but
no
man
be
more
keenly
alive
to
his
own
interest
than
he
;
and
she
persuade
herself
he
would
find
it
to
his
advantage
not
to
molest
her
:
in
which
case
she
be
safe
.
<EOS>
of
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
she
have
less
apprehension
;
for
,
though
equally
mischievous
and
malevolent
with
his
partner
,
he
be
far
feebler
of
purpose
,
and
for
the
most
part
govern
by
him
.
<EOS>
besides
,
she
feel
she
have
the
amorous
knight
in
her
toil
,
and
could
easily
manage
him
if
he
be
alone
.
<EOS>
so
the
case
stand
with
respect
to
our
pretty
hostess
;
but
,
before
proceed
further
,
it
may
be
well
to
give
a
more
complete
description
of
the
two
bird
of
prey
by
whom
she
be
threaten
with
beak
and
talon
.
<EOS>
the
master
-
spirit
of
the
twain
be
undoubtedly
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
quick
in
conception
of
villainy
,
he
be
equally
daring
in
execution
.
<EOS>
how
he
have
rise
to
his
present
bad
eminence
no
one
precisely
know
;
because
,
with
the
craft
and
subtlety
that
distinguish
him
,
he
lay
his
scheme
so
deeply
,
and
cover
his
proceeding
with
so
thick
a
veil
,
that
they
have
be
rarely
detect
.
<EOS>
report
,
however
,
speak
of
him
as
a
usurer
of
the
vile
kind
,
who
wring
exorbitant
interest
from
needy
borrowers,—who
advance
money
to
expectant
heir
,
with
the
intention
of
plunder
them
of
their
inheritance,—and
who
resort
to
every
trick
and
malpractice
permit
by
the
law
to
benefit
himself
at
his
neighbour
's
expense
.
<EOS>
these
be
bad
enough
,
but
even
graver
accusation
be
make
against
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
whisper
that
he
have
obtain
fraudulent
possession
of
deed
and
family
paper
,
which
have
enable
him
to
wrest
estate
from
their
rightful
owner
;
and
some
do
not
scruple
to
add
to
these
charge
that
he
have
forge
document
to
carry
out
his
nefarious
design
.
<EOS>
be
this
as
it
may
,
from
comparative
poverty
he
speedily
rise
to
wealth
;
and
,
as
his
mean
increase
,
so
his
avaricious
scheme
be
multiply
and
extend
.
<EOS>
His
early
day
be
pass
in
complete
obscurity
,
none
but
the
neediest
spendthrift
or
the
most
desperate
gambler
know
where
he
dwell
,
and
every
one
who
find
him
out
in
his
wretched
abode
near
the
Marshalsea
have
reason
to
regret
his
visit
.
<EOS>
now
he
be
well
enough
know
by
many
a
courtly
prodigal
,
and
his
large
mansion
near
Fleet
Bridge
(
it
be
say
of
him
that
he
always
choose
the
neigbourhood
of
a
prison
for
his
dwelling
)
be
resort
to
by
the
town
gallant
whose
,
necessity
or
extravagance
compel
them
to
obtain
supply
at
exorbitant
interest
.
<EOS>
lavish
in
his
expenditure
on
occasion
,
Sir
Giles
be
habitually
so
greedy
and
penurious
,
that
he
begrudge
every
tester
he
expend
.
<EOS>
He
wish
to
keep
up
a
show
of
hospitality
without
cost
,
and
secretly
please
himself
by
think
that
he
make
his
guest
pay
for
his
entertainment
,
and
even
for
his
establishment
.
<EOS>
His
servant
complain
of
be
half
-
starve
,
though
he
be
constantly
at
war
with
them
for
their
wastefulness
and
riot
.
<EOS>
He
make
,
however
,
a
great
display
of
attendant
,
inasmuch
as
he
have
a
whole
retinue
of
myrmidon
at
his
beck
and
call
;
and
these
,
as
before
observe
,
be
well
pay
.
<EOS>
They
be
the
crow
that
follow
the
vulture
,
and
pick
the
bone
of
the
spoil
when
their
raven
master
have
be
fully
glut
.
<EOS>
in
the
court
of
Star
-
Chamber
,
as
already
remark
,
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
find
an
instrument
in
every
way
fit
to
his
purpose
;
and
he
work
it
with
terrible
effect
,
as
will
be
show
hereafter
.
<EOS>
with
him
it
be
at
once
a
weapon
to
destroy
,
and
a
shield
to
protect
.
<EOS>
this
court
claim
"
a
superlative
power
not
only
to
take
cause
from
other
court
and
punish
them
there
,
but
also
to
punish
offence
secondarily
,
when
other
court
have
punish
them
.
"
<EOS>
take
advantage
of
this
privilege
,
when
a
suit
be
commence
against
him
elsewhere
,
Sir
Giles
contrive
to
remove
it
to
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
where
,
be
omnipotent
with
clerk
and
counsel
,
he
be
sure
of
success,—the
complaint
be
so
warily
contrive
,
the
examination
so
adroitly
frame
,
and
the
interrogatory
so
numerous
and
perplexing
,
that
the
defendant
,
or
delinquent
,
as
he
be
indifferently
style
,
be
certain
to
be
baffle
and
defeat
.
<EOS>
"
the
sentence
of
this
court
,
"
it
have
be
say
by
one
intimately
acquaint
with
its
practice
,
and
very
favourably
inclined
to
it
,
"
strike
to
the
root
of
man
's
reputation
,
and
many
time
of
their
estate
;
"
and
,
again
,
it
be
a
rule
with
it
,
that
the
prosecutor
"
be
ever
intend
to
be
favour
.
"
<EOS>
know
this
as
well
as
the
high
legal
authority
from
whom
we
have
quote
,
Sir
Giles
ever
place
himself
in
the
favour
position
,
and
,
with
the
aid
of
this
iniquitous
tribunal
,
blast
many
a
fair
reputation
,
and
consign
many
a
victim
of
its
injustice
to
the
Fleet
,
there
to
rot
till
he
pay
him
the
utmost
of
his
demand
,
or
pay
the
debt
of
nature
.
<EOS>
in
an
age
less
corrupt
and
venal
than
that
under
consideration
,
such
a
career
could
not
have
long
continue
without
check
.
<EOS>
but
in
the
time
of
James
the
First
,
from
the
neediness
of
the
monarch
himself
,
and
the
rapacity
of
his
minion
and
courtier
and
their
satellites,—each
strive
to
enrich
himself
,
no
matter
how
—
a
thousand
abuse
,
both
of
right
and
justice
,
be
tolerate
or
connive
at
,
crime
stalk
abroad
unpunished
.
<EOS>
the
Star
-
Chamber
itself
serve
the
king
as
,
in
a
less
degree
,
it
serve
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
,
and
other
of
the
same
stamp
,
as
a
means
of
increase
his
revenue
;
half
the
fine
mulct
from
those
who
incur
its
censure
or
its
punishment
be
award
to
the
crown
.
<EOS>
thus
nice
inquiry
be
rarely
make
,
unless
a
public
example
be
need
,
when
the
wrongdoer
be
compel
to
disgorge
his
plunder
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
never
do
till
the
pear
be
fully
ripe
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
,
however
,
have
no
apprehension
of
any
such
result
in
his
case
.
<EOS>
like
a
sly
fox
,
or
rather
like
a
crafty
wolf
,
he
be
too
confident
in
his
own
cunning
and
resource
to
fear
be
catch
in
such
a
trap
.
<EOS>
His
title
be
purchase
,
and
he
reap
his
reward
in
the
consequence
it
give
him
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
act
likewise
;
and
it
be
about
this
time
that
the
connection
between
the
worthy
pair
commence
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
they
have
be
in
opposition
,
and
though
very
different
in
temperament
and
in
mode
of
proceeding
,
they
have
one
aim
in
common
;
and
recognize
great
merit
in
each
other
,
couple
with
a
power
of
mutual
assistance
,
they
agree
to
act
in
concert
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
be
as
cautious
and
timid
as
Sir
Giles
be
daring
and
inflexible
:
the
one
be
the
good
contriver
of
a
scheme
,
and
the
other
the
fit
to
carry
it
out
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
tremble
at
his
own
device
and
their
possible
consequence
:
Sir
Giles
adopt
his
scheme
,
if
promising
,
and
laugh
at
the
difficulty
and
danger
that
beset
them
.
<EOS>
the
one
be
the
head
;
the
other
the
arm
.
<EOS>
not
that
Sir
Giles
lack
the
ability
to
weave
as
subtle
a
web
of
deceit
as
his
partner
;
but
each
take
his
line
.
<EOS>
It
save
time
.
<EOS>
the
plan
of
license
and
inspect
tavern
and
hotel
have
originate
with
Sir
Francis
,
and
very
profitable
it
prove
.
<EOS>
but
Sir
Giles
carry
it
out
much
further
than
his
partner
have
propose
,
or
think
prudent
.
<EOS>
and
they
be
as
different
in
personal
appearance
,
as
in
mental
quality
and
disposition
.
<EOS>
Mompesson
be
the
dash
eagle
;
Mitchell
the
sorry
kite
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
be
weakly
,
emaciate
in
frame
;
much
give
to
sensual
indulgence
;
and
his
body
conform
to
his
timorous
organization
.
<EOS>
His
shrunken
shank
scarcely
suffice
to
support
him
;
his
back
be
bent
;
his
eye
blear
;
his
head
bald
;
and
his
chin
,
which
be
continually
wag
,
clothe
with
a
scanty
yellow
beard
,
shape
like
a
stiletto
,
while
his
sandy
moustachio
be
curl
upward
.
<EOS>
He
be
dress
in
the
extremity
of
the
fashion
,
and
affect
the
air
of
a
young
court
gallant
.

He

<EOS>
Sir
Giles
be
a

with
a
well
proportion
athletic
figure

and
his
strength

be
such

that
there
seem
good
reason

as

"Sir

His

He

<EOS>

Sir

<EOS>
a
consummate
hypocrite

easily
assume
any

the
tone
natural

one

insolent
domination

bitter
raillery

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
His
manner

however

be
not

grave
dignity

clothe
himself
,
like
his
purpose
,
in
inscrutable
reserve
,
on
occasion
require
it
.
<EOS>
so
ominous
be
his
presence

that
many
person
get
out
of
his
way
,
fear
to
come
in
contact
with
him
,

give
him
offence
;
and
the
broad
walk
at
Paul

be
sometimes
clear
as
he
take
his
way
along
it

follow
by

if
this
be
the
case
with
person

how
much
terror
his
sombre
figure
must
have
inspire
,
when

as
it

to
Madame

,
with
the
aspect
of
a
merciless
creditor

enforce

CHAPTER

III.The

French
Ordinary
.
<EOS>
the
month
allow
by
the
notice
expire
,
and
Madame
Bonaventure
's
day
of
reckon
arrive
.
<EOS>
no
arrangement
have
be
attempt
in
the
interim
,
though
abundant
opportunity
of
do
so
be
afford
her
,
as
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
visit
the
Three
Cranes
almost
daily
.
<EOS>
She
appear
to
treat
the
matter
very
lightly
,
always
put
it
off
when
mention
;
and
even
towards
the
last
seem
quite
unconcerned
,
as
if
entertain
no
fear
of
the
result
.
<EOS>
apparently
,
everything
go
on
just
as
usual
,
and
no
one
would
have
suppose
,
from
Madame
Bonaventure
's
manner
,
that
she
be
aware
of
the
possibility
of
a
mine
be
spring
beneath
her
foot
.
<EOS>
perhaps
she
fancy
she
have
countermine
her
opponent
,
and
so
feel
secure
.
<EOS>
Her
indifference
puzzle
Sir
Francis
,
who
know
not
whether
to
attribute
it
to
insensibility
or
over
-
confidence
.
<EOS>
He
be
curious
to
see
how
she
would
conduct
herself
when
the
crisis
come
;
and
for
that
purpose
repair
to
the
tavern
,
about
dinner
-
time
,
on
the
appoint
day
.
<EOS>
the
hostess
receive
him
very
graciously
;
trifle
and
jest
with
him
as
be
her
custom
,
and
look
all
blandishment
and
smile
to
him
and
everybody
else
,
as
if
nothing
could
possibly
happen
to
disturb
her
serenity
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
be
more
perplex
than
ever
.
<EOS>
with
the
levity
and
heedlessness
of
a
Frenchwoman
,
she
must
have
forget
all
about
the
claim
.
<EOS>
what
if
he
should
venture
to
remind
her
of
it
?
<EOS>
well
not
.
<EOS>
the
application
would
come
soon
enough
.
<EOS>
He
be
glad
it
devolve
upon
his
partner
,
and
not
on
himself
,
to
proceed
to
extremity
with
so
charm
a
person
.
<EOS>
He
really
could
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
and
yet
all
the
while
he
chuckle
internally
as
he
think
of
the
terrible
dilemma
in
which
she
would
be
speedily
catch
,
and
how
completely
it
would
place
her
at
his
mercy
.
<EOS>
She
must
come
to
term
then
.
<EOS>
and
Sir
Francis
rub
his
skinny
hand
gleefully
at
the
thought
.
<EOS>
on
her
part
,
Madame
Bonaventure
guess
what
be
pass
in
his
breast
,
and
secretly
enjoy
the
idea
of
checkmate
him
.
<EOS>
with
a
captivating
smile
she
leave
him
to
attend
to
her
numerous
guest
.
<EOS>
and
very
numerous
they
be
on
that
day
.
<EOS>
more
so

heavy
chimnie

heavy

and
on

in
London

the
ancient

with
its

narrow
court
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
where
there
be
a
mulberry
tree
two
century
old
than
the
tavern
itself
—
to
recreate
themselves
with
the
healthful
pastime
there
afford
,
and
indulge
at
the
same
time
in
a
few
whiff
of
tobacco
,
which
,
notwithstanding
the
king
's
fulmination
against
it
,
have
already
make
its
way
among
the
people
.
<EOS>
the
ordinary

hold
in
the
principal
room
in
the
house
;
which
be
well
enough
adapt
for

<EOS>
,
king
of
France
.
<EOS>
a
long
table
generally
run
down
the
centre
of
the
room
;
but
on
this
occasion
there
be
a
raise
cross
-
table
at
the
upper
end
,
with
a
traverse
,
or
curtain
,
partially
draw
before
it
,
proclaim
the
presence
of
important
guest
.
<EOS>
here
the
napery
be
fine
,
and
the
drinking

vessel
handsomer
,
than
those
use
at
the
low
board
.
<EOS>
a
grand
banquet
seem
take
place
.
<EOS>
long

necked
flask
be
place
in
cooler

and
the
buffet
be
cover
with

and
glass

<EOS>
the
table
groan
beneath
the
number
and
variety
of
dish
set
upon
it
.
<EOS>
in
addition
to
the
customary
yeoman
-
waiter
,
there
be
a
host
of
serving
-
man
in
rich
and
varied
livery
,
but
these
attend
exclusively
on
their
lord
at
the
raise
table
,
behind
the
traverse
.
<EOS>
as
Sir
Francis
be
usher
into
the
eat
-
room
,
he
be
quite
take
aback
by
the
unusually
magnificent
display
,
and
feel
greatly
surprised
that
no
hint
of
the
banquet
have
be
give
him
,
on
his
arrival
,
by
the
hostess
.
<EOS>
the
feast
have
already
commence
;
and
all
the
yeoman
-
waiter
and
trencher
-
scraper
be
too
busily
occupy
to
attend
to
him
.
<EOS>
Cyprien
,
who
marshal
the
dish
at
the
low
table
,
do
not
deign
to
notice
him
,
and
be
deaf
to
his
demand
for
a
place
.
<EOS>
It
seem
probable
he
would
not
obtain
one
at
all
;
and
he
be
about
to
retire
,
much
disconcert
,
when
a
young
man
somewhat
plainly
habit
,
and
who
seem
a
stranger
to
all
present
,
very
good
-
naturedly
make
room
for
him
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
he
be
squeeze
in
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
then
cast
a
look
round
to
ascertain
who
be
present
;
but
he
be
so
inconveniently
situate
,
and
the
crowd
of
serving
-
man
be
so
great
at
the
upper
table
,
that
he
could
only
imperfectly
distinguish
those
seat
at
it
;
besides
which
,
most
of
the
guest
be
hide
by
the
traverse
.
<EOS>
such
,
however
,
as
he
could
make
out
be
richly
attire
in
doublet
of
silk
and
satin
,
while
their
rich
velvet
mantle
,
plume
and
jewel
cap
,
and
long
rapier
,
be
carry
by
their
servant
.
<EOS>
two
or
three
turn
round
to
look
at
him
as
he
sit
down
;
and
amongst
these
he
remark
Sir
Edward
Villiers
,
whose
presence
be
far
from
agreeable
to
him,—for
though
Sir
Edward
be
secretly
connect
with
him
and
Sir
Giles
,
and
take
tithe
of
their
spoliation
,
he
disown
them
in
public
,
and
would
assuredly
not
countenance
any
open
display
of
their
rapacious
proceeding
.
<EOS>
another
personage
whom
he
recognise
,
from
his
obesity
,
the
peculiarity
of
his
long
flow
periwig
,
and
his
black
velvet
parisian
pourpoint
,
which
contrast
forcibly
with
the
glitter
habiliment
of
his
companion
,
be
Doctor
Mayerne
-
Turquet
,
the
celebrated
french
professor
of
medicine
,
then
so
high
in
favour
with
James
,
that
,
have
be
load
with
honour
and
dignity
,
he
have
be
recently
name
the
King
's
first
physician
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Mayerne
's
ability
be
so
distinguished
,
that
his
protestant
faith
alone
,
prevent
him
from
occupy
the
same
eminent
position
in
the
court
of
France
that
he
do
in
that
of
England
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
's
presence
at
the
banquet
be
unpropitious
;
it
be
natural
he
should
befriend
a
countrywoman
and
a
Huguenot
like
himself
,
and
,
possess
the
royal
ear
,
he
may
make
such
representation
as
he
please
to
the
King
of
what
should
occur
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
hope
he
would
be
go
before
Sir
Giles
appear
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
yet
a
third
person
,
who
give
the
usurious
knight
more
uneasiness
than
the
other
two
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
handsome
young
man
,
with
fair
hair
and
delicate
feature
,
whose
slight
elegant
figure
be
array
in
a
crimson
-
satin
doublet
,
slash
with
white
,
and
hose
of
the
same
colour
and
fabric
.
<EOS>
the
young
nobleman
in
question
,
whose
handsome
feature
and
prematurely
-
waste
frame
bear
the
impress
of
cynicism
and
debauchery
,
be
Lord
Roos
,
then
recently
entrap
into
marriage
with
the
daughter
of
Sir
Thomas
Lake
,
Secretary
of
State
:
<EOS>
a
marriage

<EOS>
Lord
Roos
be
Sir
Francis
's
swear
enemy
.
<EOS>
like
many
other
such
gay
moth
,
he
have
be
severely
singe
by
flutter
into
the
dazzle
light
hold
up
to
him
,
when
he
want
money
,
by
the
two
usurer
;
and
he
have
often
vow
revenge
against
them
for
the
manner
in
which
they
have
fleece
him
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
do
not
usually
give
any
great
heed
to
his
threat
,
be
too
much
accustomed
to
reproach
and
menace
from
his
victim
to
feel
alarm
or
compunction
;
but
just
now
the
case
be
different
,
and
he
could
not
help
fear
the
vindictive
young
lord
may
seize
the
opportunity
of
serve
him
an
ill
turn,—if
,
indeed
,
he
have
not
come
there
expressly
for
the
purpose
,
which
seem
probable
,
from
the
fierce
and
disdainful
glance
he
cast
at
him
.
<EOS>
an
angry
murmur
pervade
the
upper
table
on
Sir
Francis
's
appearance
;
and
something
be
say
which
,
though
he
could
not
gather
its
precise
import
do
not
sound
agreeably
to
his
ear
.
<EOS>
He
feel
he
have
unwittingly
bring
his
head
near
a
hornet
's
nest
,
and
may
esteem
himself
lucky
if
he
escape
without
sting
.
<EOS>
however
,
there
be
no
retreating
now
;
for
though
his
fear
counsel
flight
,
very
shame
restrain
him
.
<EOS>
the
repast
be
varied
and
abundant
,
consist
of
all
kind
of
fricassee
,
collop
and
rasher
,
boil
salmon
from
the
Thames
,
trout
and
pike
from
the
same
river
,
boil
pea
-
chicken
,
and
turkey
-
poults
,
and
florentine
of
puff
paste
,
calf
-
foot
pie
,
and
set
custard
.
<EOS>
between
each
guest
a
boil
salad
be
place
,
which
be
nothing
more
than
what
we
should
term
a
dish
of
vegetable
,
except
that
the
vegetable
be
somewhat
differently
prepared
;
cinnamon
,
ginger
,
and
sugar
be
add
to
the
pulp
carrot
,
besides
a
handful
of
currant
,
vinegar
,
and
butter
.
<EOS>
a
similar
plan
be
adopt
with
the
salad
of
burrage
,
chicory
,
marigold
leave
,
bugloss
,
asparagus
,
rocket
,
and
alexander
,
and
many
other
plant
discontinue
in
modern
cookery
,
but
then
much
esteem
;
oil
and
vinegar
be
use
with
some
,
and
spice
with
all
;
while
each
dish
be
garnish
with
slice
of
hard
-
boil
egg
.
<EOS>
a
jowl
of
sturgeon
be
carry
to
the
upper
table
,
where
there
be
also
a
baked
swan
,
and
a
roasted
bustard
,
flank
by
two
stately
venison
pasty
.
<EOS>
this
be
only
the
first
service
;
and
two
other
follow
,
consist
of
a
fawn
,
with

a
grand

,
hot

,
anchovy
,
and
a
plentiful
supply
of
little
made
dish
,
and
quelquechose
,
scatter
over
the
table
.
<EOS>
with
such
a
profusion
of
good
thing
,
it
may
appear
surprising
that
Sir
Francis
should
find
very
little
to
eat
;
but
the
attendant
all
seem
in
league
against
him
,
and
whenever
he
set
his
eye
upon
a
dish
,
it
be
sure
to
be
place
out
of
reach
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
be
a
great
epicure
,
and
the
Thames
salmon
look
delicious
;
but
he
would
have
fail
in
obtain
a
slice
of
it
,
if
his
neighbour
(
the
young
man
who
have
make
room
for
him
)
have
not
give
him
the
well
-
fill
trencher
intend
for
himself
.
<EOS>
in
the
same
way
he
secure
the
wing
of
a
boil
capon
,
lard
with
preserve
lemon
,
the
sauce
of
which
be
exquisite
,
as
he
well
know
,
from
experience
.
<EOS>
Cyprien
,
however
,
take
care
he
should
get
none
of
the
turkey
poult
,
or
the
florentine
,
but
whip
off
both
dish
from
under
his
very
nose
;
and
a
like
fate
would
have
attend
a
lumbar
pie
but
for
the
interference
of
his
good
-
natured
neighbour
,
who
again
come
to
his
aid
,
and
rescue
it
from
the
clutch
of
the
saucy
Gascon
,
just
as
it

CHAPTER
IV.A
Star
-
Chamber
Victim
.
<EOS>
His
hunger
be
somewhat
stay
,
Sir
Francis
now
find
leisure
to
consider
the
young
man
who
have
so
greatly
befriend
him
,
and
,
as
a
means
of
promote
conversation
between
them
,
begin
by
fill
his
glass
from
a
flask
of
excellent
Bordeaux
,
of
which
,
in
spite
of
Cyprien
's
effort
to
prevent
him
,
he
have
contrive
to
gain
possession
.
<EOS>
the
young
man
acknowledge
his
courtesy
with
a
smile
,
praise
the
wine
,
and
express
his
astonishment
at
the
wonderful
variety
and
excellence
of
the
repast
,
for
which
he
say
he
be
quite
unprepared
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
Sir
Francis
's
way
to
feel
or
express
much
interest
in
stranger
,
and
he
dislike
young
man
,
especially
when
they
be
handsome
,
as
be
the
case
with
his
new
acquaintance
;
but
there
be
something
in
the
youth
that
rivet
his
attention
.
<EOS>
from
the
plainness
of
his
attire
,
and
a
certain
not
unplease
rusticity
of
air
,
Sir
Francis
comprehend
at
once
that
he
be
fresh
from
the
country
;
but
he
also
feel
satisfied
,
from
his
bearing
and
deportment
,
that
he
be
a
gentleman
:
a
term
not
quite
so
vaguely
applied
then
,
as
it
be
now
-
a
-
day
.
<EOS>
the
youth
have
a
fine
frank
countenance
,
remarkable
for
manly
beauty
and
intelligence
,
and
a
figure
perfectly
proportion
and
athletic
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
set
him
down
as
well
skilled
in
all
exercise
;
vault
,
leaping
,
riding
,
and
toss
the
pike
;
nor
be
he
mistaken
.
<EOS>
He
also
conclude
him
to
be
fond
of
country
sport
;
and
he
be
right
in
the
supposition
.
<EOS>
He
further
imagine
the
young
man
have
come
to
town
to
well
his
fortune
,
and
seek
a
place
at
court
;
and
he
be
not
far
wrong
in
the
notion
.
<EOS>
as
the
wily
knight
scan
the
handsome
feature
of
his
companion
,
his
clean
-
make
limb
,
and
symmetrical
figure
,
he
think
that
success
must
infallibly
attend
the
production
of
such
a
fair
youth
at
a
Court
where
personal
advantage
be
the
first
consideration
.
<EOS>
"A
likely
gallant
,
"
he
reflect
,
"
to
take
the
fancy
of
the
king
;
and
if
I
aid
him
with
mean
to
purchase
rich
attire
,
and
procure
him
a
presentation
,
he
may
not
prove
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
but
of
that
I
shall
take
good
security
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
gratitude
be
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
introduce
to
my
Lady
Suffolk
.
<EOS>
She
will
know
how
to
treat
him
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
he
must
cast
his
country
slough
.
<EOS>
that
ill
-
make
doublet
of
green
cloth
must
be
exchange
for
one
of
velvet
slash
in
the
venetian
style
like
mine
own
,
with
hose
stuff
and
bombaste
accord
to
the
mode
.
<EOS>
a
silk
stocking
will
bring
out
the
nice
proportion
of
his
leg
;
though
,
as
I
be
a
true
gentleman
,
the
youth
have
so
well
form
a
limb
that
even
his
own
villainous
yarn
covering
can
not
disfigure
it
.
<EOS>
His
hair
be
of
a
good
brown
colour
,
which
the
king
affect
much
,
and
seem
to
curl
naturally
;
but
it
want
trim
to
the
mode
,
for
he
be
rough
as
a
young
colt
fresh
from
pasture
;
and
though
he
hath
not
much
beard
on
his
chin
or
upper
lip
,
yet
<EOS>
what
he
hath
become
him
well
,
and
will
become
him
well
,
when
properly
clip
and
twist
.
<EOS>
altogether
he
be
as
goodly
a
youth
as
one
would
desire
to
see
.
<EOS>
what
if
he
should
supplant
Buckingham
,
as
Buckingham
supplant
Somerset
?
<EOS>
let
the
proud
Marquis
look
to
himself
!
<EOS>
We
may
work
his
overthrow
yet
.
<EOS>
and
now
to
question
him
.
"After
<EOS>
replenish
his
glass
,
Sir
Francis
address
himself
in
his
bland
accent
,
and
with
his
most
insidious
manner
,
to
his
youthful
neighbour:—"For
a
stranger
to
town
,
as
I
conclude
you
to
be
,
young
Sir
,
"
he
say
,
"
you
have
make
rather
a
lucky
hit
in
come
hither
to
-
day
,
since
you
have
not
only
get
a
well
dinner
than
I
(
a
constant
frequenter
of
this
french
ordinary
)
ever
see
serve
here—(though
<EOS>
the
attendance
be
abominable
,
as
you
must
have
remark
—
that
rascally
Cyprien
deserve
the
bastinado
,
)
;
but
your
civility
and
good
manner
have
introduce
you
to
one
,
who
may
,
without
presumption
,
affirm
that
he
hath
the
will
,
and
,
it
may
be
,
the
ability
to
serve
you
;
if
you
will
only
point
out
to
him
the
way
.
<EOS>
""Nay
,
worthy
Sir
,
you
be
too
kind
,
"
the
young
man
modestly
reply
;
"
I
have
do
nothing
to
merit
your
good
opinion
,
though
I
be
happy
to
have
gain
it
.
<EOS>
I
rejoice
that
accident
have
so
far
befriend
me
as
to
bring
me
here
on
this
festive
occasion
;
and
I
rejoice
yet
more
that
it
have
bring
me
acquaint
with
a
worthy
gentleman
like
yourself
,
to
whom
my
rustic
manner
prove
not
to
be
displease

<EOS>
I
have
too
few
friend
to
neglect
any
that
chance
may
offer
;
and
as
I
must
carve
my
own
way
in
the
world
,
and
fight
for
a
position
in
it
,
I
gladly
accept
any
hand
that
may
be
stretch
out
to
help
me
in
the
struggle

<EOS>
""just
as
I

it

Sir
Francis

,
"
the
very
man
I
take
him

<EOS>
as
I

he
add
aloud
,
with
apparent
cordiality
,
and
affect
to
regard
the
other
with
great
interest
;
"
and
when
I
learn
the
particular
direction
in
which
you
intend
to
shape
your

I
shall

<EOS>
but
with
some
the
short

would
not

safe

<EOS>
in
your

I

it
may
be
different

<EOS>
You
have
a

you

he
come

<EOS>
though

splendid
than

no

<EOS>
nor

though
his

instantly
detect
Sir

at

the

be
so
scandalously
treat

do
he
exhibit
any
sign
of
displeasure

take
the
slight
notice

the
circumstance
;
reserve
this
point
for
consideration
,
when
his
first

should
be
settle
.
<EOS>
an
additional
frown
may
have
darken
his
countenance
;
but
it
be
so
stern
and
sombre
,
without

no

reply
to
the

<EOS>
though
bold
enough
before

boastful
of
what
they
would
do
,
they
all
look
awed
by
his
presence
,
and
avert
their
gaze
from
him
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
indeed
,
something
so
formidable
in
the
man
,
that
to
shun
a
quarrel
with
him
be
more
a
matter
of
prudence
than
an
act
of
cowardice
;
and
on
the
present
occasion
,
no
one
like
to
be
first
to
provoke
him
;
trust
to
his
neighbour
to
commence
the
attack
,

await
the
general
outbreak

<EOS>
there
be
one
exception
,

that
be
Jocelyn

so
far

court

the
young

(
notwithstanding
the

suddenly
rise
up

throw
all
the
scorn

defiance
he
could
muster
into
his

,
return
Mompesson

one
equally
fierce

menacing
.
<EOS>
a
bitter

curl
Sir

this

his

and
he
regard
the
young
man
fixedly
,
as
if
to
grave
his

<EOS>
perhaps
they
bring
Mounchensey

father
to
mind
,
for
Sir
Giles
withdraw
his
gaze
for
a
moment
to
reflect
,

then
look

strange

become

<EOS>
It

no

come

that
the

only
bide
his

turn
upon
his

against

it
be
only
natural
<EOS>
he
should
nourish

<EOS>

,
if
it

so

Sir

seem
to
entertain

Clement

continue

zealously

well

and
Sir

give
no
sign
whatever
of
distrust

but
,
on
the
contrary
,
treat
him
with
increase
confidence
.
<EOS>
the

if

I

I
conclude
you

CHAPTER
X.The
'
Prentices
and
Their
leader
.
<EOS>
while
the
Marquis
of
Buckingham
and
his
suite
be
move
towards
the
wharf
,
amid
the
acclamation
of
the
crowd
(
for
in
the
early
part
of
his
brilliant
career
the
haughty
favourite
be
extremely
popular
with
the
multitude
,
probably
owe
to
the
princely
largesse
he
be
in
the
habit
of
distribute
among
them
)
,
a
very
different
reception
await
those
who
succeed
him
.
<EOS>
the
hurrah
and
other
vociferation
of
delight
and
enthusiasm
be
change
into
groan
,
hooting
,
and
discordant
yell
,
when
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
come
in
sight
,
support
between
two
stout
myrmidon
,
and
scarcely
able
to
maintain
his
perpendicular
as
he
be
bear
by
them
towards
the
wherry
in
wait
for
him
near
the
stair
.
<EOS>
though
the
knight
be
escort
by
Captain
Bludder
and
his
alsatian
bully
,
several
of
the
crowd
do
not
seem
disposed
to
confine
themselves
to
jeer
and
derisive
shout
,
but
menace
him
with
some
rough
usage
.
<EOS>
plant
themselves
in
his
path
,
they
shake
their
fist
in
his
face
,
with
other
gesture
of
defiance
and
indignity
,
and
could
only
be
remove
by
force
.
<EOS>
Captain
Bludder
and
his
roaring
blade
assume
their
fierce
look
,
swear
their
loud
oath
,
twist
their
shaggy
moustache
,
and
tap
their
rapier
-
hilt
;
but
they
prudently
forbore
to
draw
their
weapon
,
well
know
that
the
proceeding
would
be
a
signal
for
a
brawl
,
and
that
the
cry
of
"
club
!
"
would
be
instantly
raise
.
<EOS>
amongst
the
foremost
of
those
who
thus
obstruct
Sir
Francis
and
his
party
be
a
young
man
with
a
lithe
active
figure
,
bright
black
eye
,
full
of
liveliness
and
malice
,
an
olive
complexion
,
and
a
gipsy
-
like
cast
of
countenance
.
<EOS>
attire
in
a
tight
-
fit
brown
frieze
jerkin
with
stone
button
,
and
purple
hose
,
his
head
be
cover
with
a
montero
cap
,
with
a
cock
's
feather
stick
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
be
armed
neither
with
sword
nor
dagger
,
but
carry
a
large
cudgel
or
club
,
the
well
-
know
and
formidable
weapon
,
of
the
London
'
prentice
,
in
the
use
of
which
,
whether
as
a
quarterstaff
or
missile
,
they
be
remarkably
expert
.
<EOS>
even
a
skilful
swordsman
stand
but
poor
chance
with
them
.
<EOS>
besides
this
saucy
-
looking
personage
,
who
be
address
as
Dick
Taverner
by
his
comrade
,
there
be
many
other
,
who
,
to
judge
from
their
habiliment
and
their
cudgel
,
belong
to
the
same
fraternity
as
himself
;
that
be
to
say
,
they
be
apprentice
to
grocer
,
draper
,
haberdasher
,
skinner
,
ironmonger
,
vintner
,
or
other
respectable
artificer
or
tradesfolk
.
<EOS>
now
Dick
Taverner
have
an
especial
grudge
against
our
two
extortioner
,
for
though
he
himself
,
be
'
prentice
to
a
bookseller
in
Paul
's
Churchyard
,
have
little
concern
with
them
,
he
be
the
son
of
an
inn
-
keeper
—
<EOS>
Simon
Taverner
,
of
the
Emperor
's
Head
,
Garlick

—
who
have
be
recently
mine
by
their
exaction
,
his
licence
take
from
him
,
and
his
house
close
:
enough
to
provoke
a
less
mettlesome
spark
than
Dick
,
who
have
vow
to
revenge
the
parental
injury
on
the
first
opportunity
.
<EOS>
the
occasion
now
seem
to
present
itself
,
and
it
be
not
to
be
lose
.
<EOS>
chance
to
be
play
at
bowl
in
the
alley
behind
the
Three
Cranes
with
some
of
his
comrade
on
the
day
in
question
,
Dick
learn
from
Cyprien
what
be
go
forward
,
and
the
party
resolve
to
have
their
share
in
the
sport
.
<EOS>
if
needful
,
they
promise
the
drawer
to
rescue
his
mistress
from
the
clutch
of
her
antagonist
,
and
to
drive
them
from
the
premise
.
<EOS>
but
their
service
in
this
respect
be
not
require
.
<EOS>
They
next
decide
on
give
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
a
sound
duck
in
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
Their
measure
be
quickly
and
warily
take
.
<EOS>
issue
from
an
arched
doorway
at
the
side
of
the
tavern
,
they
station
some
of
their
number
near
it
,
while
the
main
party
post
themselves
at
the
principal
entrance
in
front
.
<EOS>

to
communicate
with

and
messenger

"
and
summon
the
neighbouring
'
prentice
from
Queenhithe
,
Thames
Street
,
Trinity
Lane
,
Old
Fish
Street
,
and
Dowgate
Hill
;
so
that
fresh
auxiliary
be
constantly
arrive
.
<EOS>
Buckingham
,
with
the
young
noble
and
gallant
,
be
,
of
course
,
allow
to
pass
free
,
and
be
loudly

;
but
the
'
prentice
soon
ascertain
from
their
scout
that
Sir
Francis
be
come
forth
,
and
make
ready
for
him
.
<EOS>
utterly
unconscious
of
his
danger
,
the
inebriate
knight
reply
to
the
gibe
,
scoff
,
and
menace
address
to
him
,
by
snap
his
finger
in
his
opponent
'
face
,
and
irritate
them
in
their
turn
;
but
if
he
be
insensible
of
the
risk
he
run
,
those
around
him
be
not
,
and
his
two
supporter
endeavour
to
hurry
him
forward
.
<EOS>
violently
resist
their
effort
,
he
try
to
shake
them
off
,
and
more
than
once
stand
stock
-
still
,
until
compel
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
arrive
at
the
stairhead
,
he
next
refuse
to
embark
,
and
a
scene
of
violent
altercation
ensue
between
him
and
his
attendant
.
<EOS>
many
boat
be
moor
off
the
shore
,
with
a
couple
of
barge
close
at
hand
;
and
the
waterman
and
oarsman
stand
up
in
their
craft
,
listen
to
what
be
go
forward
with
much
apparent
amusement
.
<EOS>
hastily
descend
the
step
,
Captain
Bludder
place
himself
near
the
wherry
intend
for
the
knight
,
and
call
to
the
other
to
make
short
work
of
it
and
bring
him
down
.
<EOS>
at
this
juncture
the
word
be
give
by
Dick
Taverner
,
who
act
as
leader
,
and
in
less
than
two
minute
,
Sir
Francis
be
transfer
from
the
hand
of
his
myrmidon
to
those
of
the
'
prentice
.
<EOS>
to
accomplish
this
,
a
vigorous
application
of
cudgel
be
require
,
and
some
broken
pate
be
the
consequence
of
resistance
;
but
the
attack
be
perfectly
successful
;
the
myrmidon
and
Alsatians
be
route
,
and
the
'
prentice
remain
master
of
the
field
,
and
captor
of
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
stupefy
with
rage
and
astonishment
,
Captain
Bludder
look
on
;
at
one
moment
think
of
draw
his
sword
,
and
join
the
fray
;
but
the
next
,
perceive
that
his
man
be
evidently
worst
,
he
decide
upon
make
off
;
and
with
this
view
he
be
about
to
jump
into
the
wherry
,
when
his
purpose
be
prevent
by
Dick
Taverner
,
and
a
few
other
of
the
most
active
of
his
companion
,
who
dash
down
the
step
to
where
he
stand
.
<EOS>
the
captain
have
already
get
one
foot
in
the
wherry
,
and
the
waterman
,
equally
alarm
with
himself
,
be
try
to
push
off
,
when
the
invader
come
up
,
and
,
spring
into
the
boat
,
take
possession
of
the
oar
,
send
Bludder
flounder
into
the
Thames
,
where
he
sink
up
to
the
shoulder
,
and
stick
fast
in
the
mud
,
roar
piteously
for
help
.
<EOS>
scarcely
be
the
'
prentice
seat
,
than
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
be
bring
down
to
them
,
and
the
poor
knight
,
begin
to
comprehend
the
jeopardy
in
which
he
be
place
,
roar
for
help
as
lustily
as
the
half
-
drown
alsatian
captain
,
and
quite
as
ineffectually
.
<EOS>
the
latter
be
leave
to
shift
for
himself
,
but
the
former
be
row
out
some
twenty
or
thirty
yard
from
the
shore
,
where
,
a
stout
cord
be
fasten
to
his
girdle
,
he
be
plunge
head
-
foremost
into
the
river
;
and
after
be
thrice
draw
up
,
and
as
often
submerge
again
,
he
be
drag
on
board
,
and
leave
to
shiver
and
shake
in
his
dripping
habiliment
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
.
<EOS>
the
bath
have
completely
sober
him
,
and
he
bitterly
bemoan
himself
,
declare
that
if
he
do
not
catch
his
death
of
cold
he
should
be
plague
with
cramp
and
rheumatism
during
the
rest
of
his
day
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
dare
to
utter
any
threat
against
his
persecutor
,
but
he
internally
vow
to
be
revenge
upon
them
—
cost
what
it
may
.
<EOS>
the
'
prentice
laugh
at
his
complaint
,
and
Dick
Taverner
tell
him—"that
as
he
like
not
cold
water
,
he
should
have
spare
them
their
ale
and
wine
;
but
,
as
he
have
meddle
with
their
liquor
,
and
with
those
who
sell
them
,
they
have
give
him
a
taste
of
a
different
beverage
,
which
they
should
provide
,
free
of
cost
,
for
all
those
who
interfere
with
their
enjoyment
,
and
the
right
of
the
public

"
<EOS>
Dick
add
,
"
that
his
last
sousing
be
in
requital
for
the
stoppage
of
the
Emperor
's
Head
,
and
that
,
with
his
own
free
will
,
he
would
have
leave
him
under
the
water
,
with
a
stone
round
his
neck

"This

measure
of

neither

so
by
that
personage

cover
with

<EOS>
His

float
down

while

accept

run
your

You

do
not

not

have
you
provoke
Sir

be
more
easily
arouse
than
appeased

but
you
have
defy
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
,
who
be
equally
implacable
in
his
enmity
;
and
as
if
two
such
enemy
be

you

to
my

you

<EOS>
for
the
latter
indiscretion
there
can
be
no
excuse

whatever
there
may
be
for
the
former
;
and
it
be
simple
madness
to
affront
a
nobleman
of
his
exalted
rank
,
second
only
in
authority
to
the
King
himself

<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
how
have
I

surprised

"Is
<EOS>
it
possible

you

"
<EOS>
John
Wolfe
rejoin

look
hard
at

<EOS>
"
It
may
be
so
,
for
you
be
plainly
ignorant
of

.
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
"
he
add
,
lower
his
tone
,
"
when
you
say
that
these
two
abominable
extortioner
be
the
creature
of
some
great
man
,
who
gloze
over
their
villainous
practice
to
the
King
,
and
give
a
well
account
of
them
than
they
deserve
,
you
be
nearer
the
truth
than
you
imagine
;
but
it
could
hardly
be
agreeable
to
the
Marquis
to
be
tell
this
to
his
face
,
since
it
be
notorious
to
all
(
except
to
yourself
)
that
he
be
the
man
.
<EOS>
""Heavens
!
"
exclaim
Jocelyn
,
"
I
now
see
the
error
I
have
commit
.
<EOS>
""a
<EOS>
grave
error
indeed
,
"
rejoin
Wolfe
,
shake
his
head
,
"
and
most
difficult
to
be
repair
—
for
the
plea
of
ignorance
,
though
it
may
suffice
with
me
,
will
scarcely
avail
you
with
the
Marquis
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
it
can
never
be
urge
,
since
he
disown
any
connection
with
these
man
;
and
it
be
suspect
that
his
half
-
brother
,
Sir
Edward
Villiers
,
go
between
them
in
all
their
secret
transaction
.
<EOS>
of
this
,
however
,
I
know
nothing
personally
,
and
only
tell
you
what
I
have
hear
.
<EOS>
but
if
it
be
not
almost
treasonable
to
say
it
,
I
may
add
,
that
his
Majesty
be
far
too
careless
of
the
mean
whereby
his
exchequer
be
enrich
,
and
his
favourite
gratify
;
and
,
at
all
event
,
suffer
himself
to
be
too
easily
impose
upon
.
<EOS>
hence
all
these
patent
and
monopoly
under
which
we
groan
.
<EOS>
the
favourite
must
have
money
;
and
as
the
King
have
little
to
give
them
,
they
raise
as
much
as
they
please
on
the
credit
of
his
name
.
<EOS>
thus
everything
be
sell
;
place
,
post
,
title
,
all
have
their
price
—
bribery
and
corruption
reign
everywhere
.
<EOS>
the
lord
-
keeper
pay
a
pension
to
the
Marquis
—
so
doth
the
attorney
-
general
—
and
simony
be
openly
practise
;
for
the
Bishop
of
Salisbury
pay
him
£
3,500
for
his
bishopric
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
the
bad
of
it
.
<EOS>
be
it
not
terrible
to
think
of
a
proud
nobleman
,
clothe
almost
with
supreme
authority
,
be
secretly
league
with
sordid
wretch
,
whose
practice
he
openly
discountenance
and
contemn
,
and
receive
share
of
their
spoil
?
<EOS>
be
it
not
yet
more
terrible
to
reflect
that
the
royal
coffer
be
in
some
degree
supply
by
similar
means?""'Tis
enough

Jocelyn

you
can
not
wonder
at

nothing

be

there
be

his
design

execution

would
incur

as
well
from
the
resolute
character
of
the
young
man
himself
,
who
be
certain
to
offer
determined
resistance

as
from
the
temper

the
company

decidedly
adverse

occasion
a
disturbance
that
would
probably
result
in
the
prisoner
's
rescue
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
any
case
,
Sir
Giles
,
"
say
the
wily
scrivener
,
"
let
me
counsel
you
to
tarry
till
the
great
part
of
the
guest
be
go
,
and
the
assemblage
outside
disperse
;
for
I
note
many
turbulent
'
prentice
among
the
mob
,
who
be
sure
to
be
troublesome
.
<EOS>
""Since
<EOS>
the
young
man
show
no
present
disposition
to
quit
the
house
,
"
Sir
Giles
reply
,
look
askance
at
Jocelyn
,
who
just
then
have
move
to
another
part
of
the
room
with
Madame
Bonaventure
,
"
there
be
no
urgency
;
and
it
may
be
prudent
to
pause
a
few
moment
,
as
you
suggest
,
good
lupo
.
<EOS>
but
I
will
not
suffer
him
to
depart
.
<EOS>
I
perceive
,
from
her
gesture
and
glance
,
that
our
tricksy
hostess
be
plot
some
scheme
with
him
.
<EOS>
plot
away
,
fair
mistress
;
you
must
have
more
cunning
than
I
give
you
credit
for
,
if
you
outwit
me
a
second
time
in
the
same
day
.
<EOS>
I
can
guess
what
she
propose
.
<EOS>
You
note
that
side
door
near
them
,
Lupo
?
<EOS>
She
be
advise
the
youth
's
flight
that
way
;
and
he
,
like
a
hair
-
brain
fool
,
will
not
listen
to
the
suggestion
.
<EOS>
but
it
will
be
well
to
watch
the
outlet
.
<EOS>
Hark
ye
,
Lanyere
<EOS>
,
"
he
add
to
the
promoter
,
"
take
three
man
with
you
,
and
go
round
quickly
to
the
passage
with
which
yon
door
communicate
.
<EOS>
station
yourself
near
the
outlet
;
and
if
Mounchensey
come
forth
,
arrest
him
instantly
.
<EOS>
You
see
the
door
I
mean
?
<EOS>
about
it
,
<EOS>
quick!"And
Lanyere
instantly
depart
with
three
of
the
myrmidon
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
would
this
arrest
could
be
lawfully
effect
,
Sir
Giles
,
"
say
Lupo
Vulp
,
"
by
a
serjeant
-
at
-
arm
or
pursuivant
.
<EOS>
there
would
then
be
no
risk
.
<EOS>
again
I
venture
to
counsel
you
to
proceed
regularly
.
<EOS>
no
great
delay
would
be
occasion
,
if
your
worship
go
to
Westminster
,
and
make
a
complaint
against
the
young
man
before
the
Council
.
<EOS>
in
that
case
a
messenger
of
the
Court
would
be
despatch
to
attach
his
person
;
and
even
if
he
should
quit
the
house
in
the
meanwhile
,
Lanyere
will
keep
on
his
track
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
sure
course
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
manner
of
proceeding
,
I
conclude
it
will
be
by
Ore
tenus
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
likely
that
this
youth
's
headstrong
temper
,
couple
with
his
fantastic
notion
of
honour
,
will
permit
him
to
deny
your
worship
's
accusation
,
and
therefore
his
confession
be
write
down
,
and
subscribe
by
himself
,
will
be
exhibit
against
him
when
he
be
bring
to
the
bar
of
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
and
he
will
be
judge
ex
ore
suo
.
<EOS>
Your
worship
will
make
quick
work
of
it
.
<EOS>
""Cum

Sir
Giles

<EOS>
"
no
one

savage
joy
on
perceive
Jocelyn

scale
a

door
in

situate
elsewhere

,
its
fastening
be
rusty
,
and
refuse
to
act

<EOS>
this
delay
favour
the
pursuer
;

on
hear
their
approach
,
Jocelyn
strove
to
effect
his
retreat
in
the
manner
describe

<EOS>
but
Sir
Giles
be
further
serve
,
though
unintentionally

by
Madame

who
succeed
in

back
the
rusty
bolt
at

up

the

thrust
her
rudely
aside

spring
through

doorway

Jocelyn
leap
from

Disregarding
Sir

's

the
young
man
hurry
on

he
reach
the
middle
of
the
bowling

green

where
,
find
flight
impossible

as
there
be
no
apparent
outlet
at
the
further
end
of
the
garden

while
it
be
certain
that
the
tipstave
would
pluck
him
from
the
wall
with
their
hook
if
he
attempt
to
clamber
over
it
,
he
turn
,
and
stand
upon
his
defence

<EOS>
willing
to
have
the
credit
of
disarm
him
unaided
,

confident
in
his
own
superior
strength

skill
,
Sir
Giles
sign
to
his
myrmidon
to
stand
back

while
he
alone
advance
towards
the
young
man

<EOS>
a
turn
in
his
strong
wrist
<EOS>
would
,
he
imagine
,
suffice
to
accomplish
his
purpose

<EOS>
but
he
find
out
his
error
<EOS>
the
moment
he
engage
with
his
opponent
.
<EOS>
in
dexterity
and
force
the
latter
be
fully
his
match
,
while
in
nimbleness
of
body
Jocelyn
surpass
him
.
<EOS>
the
deadly
glance
throw
at
him
by
the
young
man
show
that
the
animosity
of
the
latter
would
only
be
satisfied
with
blood
.
<EOS>
change
his
purpose
,
therefore
,
Sir
Giles
,
in
place
of
attempt
to
cross
his
antagonist
's
sword
,
rapidly
disengage
his
point
,
and
deliver
a
stoccata
,
or
in
modern
term
of
fence
,
a
thrust
in
carte
,
over
the
arm
,
which
be
instantly
parry
.
<EOS>
for
some
minute
the
conflict
continue
without
material
success
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
hold
his
rapier
short
,
with
the
point
towards
his
adversary
's
face
,
Jocelyn
retreat
a
few
pace
at
first
,
but
then
,
charge
in
turn
,
speedily
win
back
his
ground
.
<EOS>
Stoccatas
,
imbroccatas
,
drittas
,
mandrittas
,
and
riversas
be
exchange
between
them
in
a
manner
that
delight
the
myrmidon
,
most
of
whom
be
amateur
of
sword
-
play
.
<EOS>
infuriate
by
the
unexpected
resistance
he
encounter
,
Sir
Giles
,
at
length
,
resolve
to
terminate
the
fight
;
and
,
find
his
antagonist
constantly
upon
some
sure
ward
,
endeavour
to
reach
him
with
a
half
incartata
;
but
instantly
shift
his
body
with
marvellous
dexterity
,
Jocelyn
strike
down
the
other
's
blade
,
and
reply
with
a
straight
thrust
,
which
must
infallibly
have
take
effect
,
if
his
rapier
have
not
be
beat
from
his
grasp
by
Clement
Lanyere
at
the
very
moment
it
touch
his
adversary
's
breast
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
the
young
man
's
arm
be
grasp
from
behind
by
two
of
the
myrmidon
,
and
he
lie
at
his
enemy
's
disposal
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
,
however
,
sheathe
his
rapier
,
say
,
with
a
grim
smile
,
"
that
he
do
not
mean
to
deprive
himself
of
the
satisfaction
of
see
his
foe
stand
in
the
pillory
,
and
submit
to
the
sworn
torturer
's
knife
;
"
add
,
"
it
be
somewhat
strange
that
one
who
could
guard
his
body
so
well
,
should
keep
such
indifferent
watch
over
his
tongue
.
<EOS>
"Jocelyn
make
no

the
sarcasm

knight

give
some
order
respect
Jocelyn

then
prepare
to
resist
the
onslaught

by
cause

band

his

in
a
loud
authoritative
tone
command
the
apprentice
to
stand
back

<EOS>
such
be
the
effect
produce
by
his
voice
,

the
terror
of
his
countenance
,
which
seldom
fail
to
strike
awe
into

<EOS>
the

<EOS>

the

manfully
,
and
it
still
appear
doubtful
whether
Sir

would
be
able
to
effect
a
retreat
after
all
,
embarrassed
as
he
now
be
with

prisoner

<EOS>
under

circumstance
he
make
a
sign
to
Clement

to
withdraw

,
order
the
two
myrmidon
who
have
charge
of
Dick
Taverner
to
follow
him
with

<EOS>
It
be
no

the
man
have
them
in

<EOS>
Hitherto
Jocelyn
have
make
no
attempt
at
self

liberation
;
awaiting
,
probably
,
the
result
of
the
'

'
effort
in

some
more
favourable
opportunity
than

on

<EOS>
shake
off

pinion
him

and
seize
a
bill
from
one
of

,
he
instantly
stretch
the
fellow
at
his
foot
,
and
drive
off
his
comrade

<EOS>
this
done
,
he
lend
immediate
assistance
to
Dick

,
set
him
free
,
and
arm
him
with
as
much
promptitude
as

<EOS>
while
thus
engage

he
receive
no

though
,
if
he
have
choose
,
the
promoter
may
no
doubt
have
effectually
oppose
him

<EOS>
but
Lanyere
either
be
,
or
feign
to
be

engage
with
some
skirmisher
at
the
door
;
and
it
be
only
when
both

have

that
he
rush
towards
them
,
loudly
reprehend
the
man
for
their
carelessness
.
<EOS>
but
if
they
be
to
blame
,
he
be
no
less
so
,
for
he
show
little
address
in
follow
the
fugitive
,
and
manage
to
take
a
wrong
turn
in
the
passage
,
which
lead
both
him

the
myrmidon
astray
,
so
that
the
prisoner
get
clear
off

how
Jocelyn

Dick
Taverner
contrive
to
reach
the
Vintry
Wharf

neither

very
distinctly
<EOS>
knew,—such
be
the
hurried
manner
in
which
they
pass
through
the
tavern
;
but
there
they
be
,
precisely
at
the
moment
that
Sir
Giles
Mompesson

have
fight
his

through
all
opposition
,
issue
from
the
porch
at

quite
satisfied
with
his
previous

with

anxious

CHAPTER
XIII.How
Jocelyn

encountereda
mask
horseman
on
Stamford
Hill
.
<EOS>
two
day
after
the
event
last
record
,
a
horseman
,
follow
at
a
respectful
distance
by
a
mount
attendant
,
take
his
way
up
Stamford
Hill
.
<EOS>
He
be
young
,
and
of
singularly
prepossess
appearance
,
with
a
countenance
full
of
fire
and
spirit
,
and
bloom
with
health
,
and
it
be
easy
to
see
that
his
life
have
be
pass
in
the
country
,
and
in
constant
manly
exercise
;
for
though
he
manage
his
horse
—
a
powerful
bay
charger
—
to
perfection
,
there
be
nothing
of
the
town
gallant
,
or
of
the
soldier
,
about
him
.
<EOS>
His
doublet
and
cloak
be
of
a
plain
dark
material
,
and
have
see
service
;
but
they
well
become
his
fine
symmetrical
figure
,
as
do
the
buff
boot
defend
his
well
-
make
,
vigorous
limb
.
<EOS>
well
seat
in
saddle
,
or
light
hand
with
bridle
,
no
man
could
possess
than
he
;
and
his
noble
steed
,
which
like
himself
be
full
of
courage
and
ardour
,
respond
to
all
his
movement
,
and
obey
the
slight
indication
of
his
will
.
<EOS>
His
arm
be
rapi
and
dagger
;
and
his
broad
-
leaved
hat
,
ornament
with
a
black
feather
,
cover
the
luxuriant
brown
lock
that
fall
in
long
ringlet
over
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
so
débonnair
be
the
young
horseman
in
deportment
,
so
graceful
in
figure
,
and
so
comely
in
look
,
that
he
have
excite
no
little
admiration
as
he
ride
forth
at
an
early
hour
that
morning
from
Bishopgate
Street
,
and
pass
under
the
wide
portal
in
the
old
city
wall
,
speed
towards
the
then
rural
district
of
Shoreditch
,
leave
Old
Bedlam
and
its
saddening
association
on
the
right
,
and
Finsbury
Fields
,
with
its
garden
,
dog
-
house
,
and
windmills
,
on
the
left
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
Bishopgate
-
Street
-
without
a
considerable
crowd
be
collect
round
a
party
of
comely
young
milkmaid
,
who
be
execute
a
lively
and
characteristic
dance
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
bagpipe
and
fiddle
.
<EOS>
instead
of
carry
pail
as
be
their
will
not
,
these
milkmaid
,
who
be
all
very
neatly
attire
,
bear
on
their
head
a
pile
of
silver
plate
,
borrow
for
the
occasion
,
arrange
like
a
pyramid
,
and
adorn
with
riband
and
flower
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
they
visit
all
their
customer
and
dance
before
their
door
.
<EOS>
a
pretty
usage
then
observe
in
the
environ
of
the
metropolis
in
the
month
of
May
<EOS>
the
merry
milkmaid
set
up
a
joyous
shout
as
the
youth
ride
by
;
and
many
a
bright
eye
follow
his
gallant
figure
till
it
disappear
.
<EOS>
at
the
Conduit
beyond
Shoreditch
,
a
pack
of
young
girl
,
who
be
draw
water
,
suspend
their
task
to
look
after
him
;
and
so
do
every
buxom
country
lass
he
encounter
,
whether
seat
in
tilt
cart
,
or
on
a
pillion
behind
her
sturdy
sire
.
<EOS>
to
each
salutation
address
to
him
the
young
man
cordially
reply
,
in
a
voice
blithe
as
his
look
;
and
in
some
case
,
where
the
greeting
be
give
by
an
elderly
personage
,
or
a
cap
be
respectfully
doff
to
him
,
he
uncover
his
own
proud
head
,
and
display
his
handsome
feature
yet
more
fully
.
<EOS>
so
much
for
the
master
:
now
for
the
man
.
<EOS>
in
his
own
opinion
,
at
least
—
for
he
be
by
no
mean
deficient
in
self
-
conceit
—
the
latter
come
in
for
an
equal
share
of
admiration
;
and
certe
,
if
impudence
could
help
him
to
win
it
,
he
lack
not
the
recommendation
.
<EOS>
stare
most
of
the
girl
out
of
countenance
,
he
leer
at
some
of
them
so
offensively
,
that
their
male
companion
shake
their
fist
or
whip
at
him
,
and
sometimes
launch
a
stone
at
his
head
.
<EOS>
equally
free
be
he
in
the
use
of
his
tongue
;
and
his
jest
be
so
scurrilous
and
so
little
relish
by
those
to
whom
they
be
address
,
that
it
be
,
perhaps
,
well
for
him
,
in
some
instance
,
that
the
speed
at
which
he
ride
soon
carry
him
out
of
harm
's
reach
.
<EOS>
the
knave
be
not
ill
-
favour
;
be
young
,
supple
of
limb
,
olive
-
complexioned
,
black
-
eyed
,
saucy
,
roguish
-
look
,
with
a
turn
-
up
nose
,
and
extremely
white
tooth
.
<EOS>
He
wear
no
livery
,
and
indeed
his
attire
be
rather
that
of
a
citizen
's
apprentice
than
such
as
beseem
a
gentleman
's
lacquey
.
<EOS>
He
be
well
mount
on
a
stout
sorrel
horse
;
but
though
the
animal
be
tractable
enough
,
and
easy
in
its
pace
,
he
experience
considerable
difficulty
in
maintain
his
seat
on
its
back
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
,
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
and
Dick
Taverner
(
for
the
reader
will
have
have
no
difficulty
in
recognise
the
pair
)
arrive
at
Stamford
Hill
;
and
the
former
,
draw
in
the
rein
,
proceed
slowly
up
the
gentle
ascent
.
<EOS>
It
be
one
of
those
delicious
spring
morning
,
when
all
nature
seem
to
rejoice
;
when
the
newly
-
open
leave
be
greenest
and
fresh
;
when
the
lark
spring
blithest
from
the
verdant
mead
,
and
soar
near
heaven
;
when
a
thousand
other
feather
chorister
warble
forth
their
note
in
copse
and
hedge
;
when
the
rook
caw
mellowly
near
their
nest
in
the
lofty
tree
;
when
gentle
shower
,
have
fall
overnight
,
have
kindly
prepare
the
earth
for
the
morrow
's
genial
warmth
and
sunshine
;
when
that
sunshine
,
each
moment
,
call
some
new
object
into
life
and
beauty
;
when
all
you
look
upon
be
pleasant
to
the
eye
,
all
you
listen
to
be
delightful
to
the
ear;—in
short
,
it
be
one
of
those
exquisite
morning
,
only
to
be
meet
with
in
the
merry
month
of
May
,
and
only
to
be
experience
in
full
perfection
in
Merry
England
.
<EOS>
arrive
at
the
summit
of
the
hill
,

such
extensively
charming

,
Jocelyn

and
look
back
with
wonder
at
the
vast
and
populous
city
he
have
just
quit
,
now
spread
out
before
him
in
all
its
splendour
and
beauty
.
<EOS>
in
his
eye
it
seem
already
over

though
it

not

a

of
its

proportion
;
but
he
could
only
judge

to
his
opportunity

and
be
unable
to
foresee
its
future
magnitude
.
<EOS>
but
if
London

wealth

and

during
the

the
peculiar

all

<EOS>
all
the

have
be
devour

a
New

rise
in
their
stead;—not

compare
with
the
Old
City

though

convey
no

any
more

<EOS>
another
advantage
in
those

must
not
be
forget
.
<EOS>
the
canopy
of
smoke
overhang
the
vast
Modern
Babel
,
and
oftentime
obscure
even
the
light
of
the
sun

,
do
not

the
beauty
of
the
Ancient
city,—sea
coal
being
but
little
use
in
comparison
with
wood
,
of
which
there
be
then
abundance
,
as
at
this
time
in
the
capital
of
France
.
<EOS>
thus
the
atmosphere
be
clear
and
light
,
and
serve
as
a
fine
medium
to

object
which

now

the

<EOS>
fair

one
gigantic

the
glorious

<EOS>
far
on

and
beyond
the

though

the

a

the
scene

<EOS>
look
westward

the

pleasant

on
Charing

the
elaborately

then

Westminster
Abbey

more
beautiful
without
its
tower

for
there

in
one
of
its
chamber

the
ceiling

gilded

be
hold
the
council
of
that
terrible
tribunal

rob
him
of
his

and
now
threaten
him
with
deprivation

liberty

and
mutilation
of

<EOS>
a
shudder
cross
him
as
he

of
the
Star

and
he
turn
his
gaze
elsewhere
,
try
to
bring
the
whole
glorious
city

<EOS>
a
splendid
view
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
well
may
King
James
himself
exclaim
when
stand
,
not
many
year
previously
,
on
the
very
spot
where
Jocelyn
now
stand
,
and
look
upon
London
for
the
first
time
since
his
accession
to
the
throne
of
England
—
well
may
he
exclaim
in
rapturous
accent
,
as
he
gaze
on
the
magnificence
of
his
capital—"At
<EOS>
last
the
rich
jewel
in
a
monarch
's
crown
<EOS>

<EOS>
mine!"After
satiate
himself
with
this
,
to
him
,
novel
and
wonderful
prospect
<EOS>
,
Jocelyn
begin
to
bestow
his
attention
on
object
closer
at
hand
,
and
examine
the
landscape
on
either
side
of
the
eminence
,
which
,
without
offer
any
feature
of
extraordinary
beauty
,
be
generally
pleasing
,
and
exercise
a
soothing
influence
upon
his
mind
.
<EOS>
at
that
time
Stamford
Hill
be
crown
with
a
grove
of
tree
,
and
its
eastern
declivity
be

through

swampy
vale
on

the
river
Lea

so
dear
to
the
angler

take
its
slow
and
silent
course
;
while
through
a
green
valley
on
the
right
,
flow
the
New
River

then
only
just
open
.
<EOS>
point
out
the
latter
channel
to
Jocelyn
,
Dick
Taverner
,
who
have
now
come
up
,
inform
him
that
he
be
present
at
the
completion
of
that
important
undertaking
.
<EOS>
and
a
famous
sight
it
be
,
the
apprentice

.
<EOS>
the
Lord
Mayor
of
London
,
the
Aldermen
,
and
the
Recorder

all
present
in
their
robe
and

to
watch
the

which
be
to
pour
the
stream
that
have
run
from
Amwell
Head
into
the

cistern
near
Islington

<EOS>
and
this

<EOS>
"A
<EOS>
proud
day
it
be
for
Sir

Myddleton
,
"
Dick
add
;

and
some
reward
for
his
perseverance
through
difficulty
and
disappointment
.
<EOS>
""It

the
good

have
obtain
more
substantial
reward

Jocelyn

<EOS>
"
He
have
confer
an
inestimable
boon
upon
his
fellow

citizen

be
entitle

their
gratitude
for
it

<EOS>
""as
to
gratitude
on
the
part
of
the
citizen
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
say
much
for
that
,
Sir

<EOS>
and
it
be
not
every
man
that
meet
with
his
dessert
,
or
we
know
where
our
friend
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
and
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
would

<EOS>
the
good
cit
be
content
to
drink
the
pure
water
of
the
New
River
,
without
bestow
a

on
him

it
to
their

<EOS>
meantime
,
the
work
have
well

nigh
beggar
Sir
Hugh
Myddleton
,
and
he
be
likely
to
obtain
little
recompense
beyond
what
the
consciousness
of
his
own
beneficent
act
will
afford
him
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
will
not
the
King
requite
him
?
"
<EOS>
Jocelyn
ask

<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
King
have
requite
him
with
a
title
,
"
Dick
return
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
title
,
however
,
which
may
be
purchase
at
a
less
price
than
good
Sir
Hugh
have
pay
for
it
,
now
-
a

day
.
<EOS>
but
it
must
be
own
,
to
our
sovereign
's
credit
,
that
he
do
far
more
than
the
citizen
of
London
would
do
;
since
when
they
refuse
to
assist
Master
Myddleton
(
as
he
then
be
)
in
his
most
useful
work
,
King
James

,
and
bind
himself
by
indenture
under
the
great
seal
,
to
pay
half
the
expense
.
<EOS>
without
this
,
it
would
probably
never

<EOS>
""i
trust
<EOS>
it
may
be
profitable
to
Sir

in
the
end

Jocelyn

;

<EOS>
and
if
not

he
will
reap
his
reward
hereafter
.
<EOS>
""It

not
unlikely
we

near
Edmonton

Dick

;
"
and
if
so
,
I
will
point
him
out
to
you

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
the

a
jovial

trusty

may
give
us
information

will
be
useful

""i

""I

at

We

conceal

from

horseman

himself
directly
in

authoritative
voice

to
stand
;
and
enforce
attention
to
the
injunction
by
level

caliver
at
Jocelyn

<EOS>
the
appearance

this
personage

mysterious
as
formidable

<EOS>
the
upper
part
of
his
feature

by
a
black
mask

<EOS>
His
habiliment
be
sable

sable
likewise

besides
the
caliver
he

armed
with
sword
and
poniard

<EOS>
altogether

unpleasant
obstacle
in

way

<EOS>
Dick

be
not

<EOS>
the
suddenness
with

forth
upon

scare
his
horse

""Never

popular
sport
and
pastime
be
wisely
encourage
by
James
the
First
,
whose
great
consideration
for
the
enjoyment
of
the
humbler
class
of
his
subject
can
not
be
too
highly
commended
;
and
since
the
main
purpose
of
this
history
be
to
point
out
some
of
the
abuse
prevalent
during
his
reign
,
it
be
but
fair
that
at
least
one
of
the
redeeming
feature
should
be
mention
.
<EOS>
It
have
ever
be
the
practice
of
sour
-
spirited
sectarianism
to
discountenance
recreation
of
any
kind
,
however
harmless
,
on
the
Sabbath
;
and
several
flagrant
instance
of
this
sort
of
interference
,
on
the
part
of
the
puritanical
preacher
and
their
disciple
,
have
come
before
James
during
his
progress
through
the
northern
county
of
England
,
and
especially
Lancashire
,
he
cause
,
on
his
return
to
London
,
his
famous
Declaration
concern
Lawful
Sports
on
Sundays
and
holiday
to
be
promulgate
;
wherein
a
severe
rebuke
be
administer
to
the
Puritans
and
precisians
,
and
the
cause
of
the
people
espouse
in
term
,
which
,
while
most
creditable
to
the
monarch
,
be
not
altogether
inapplicable
to
other
time
besides
those
in
which
they
be
deliver
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
whereas
,
"
say
King
James
,
in
his
Manifesto
,
"
We
do
justly
rebuke
some
Puritans
and
precise
people
,
and
take
order
that
the
like
unlawful
carriage
should
not
be
use
by
any
of
them
hereafter
,
in
the
prohibiting
and
unlawful
punishing
of
our
good
people
for
use
their
lawful
recreation
and
honest
exercise
upon
Sundays
and
other
holiday
,
after
the
afternoon
sermon
or
service
:
we
now
find
that
two
sort
of
people
wherewith
that
country
be
much
infested
<EOS>
(
we
mean
papist
and
Puritans
)
have
maliciously
traduce
those
our
just
and
honourable
proceeding
.
<EOS>
and
therefore
we
have
think
good
hereby
to
clear
and
make
our
pleasure
to
be
manifest
to
all
our
good
people
in
those
part
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
sum
up
his
argument
,
in
favour
of
the
license
grant
,
as
follows:—"For
when
shall
the
common
people
have
leave
to
exercise
,
if
not
upon
the
Sundays
and
holiday
,
see
they
must
apply
their
labour
,
and
win
their
living
in
all
work
day
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
truly
,
an
unanswerable
proposition
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
that
these
provision
for
rational
recreation
be
make
,
all
unlawful
game
be
prohibit
.
<EOS>
conformity
be
strictly
enjoin
on
the
part
of
the
Puritans
themselves
;
and
disobedience
be
render
punishable
by
expatriation
,
as
in
the
case
of
recusant
generally
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
tenor
of
the
royal
mandate
address
to
the
bishop
of
each
diocese
and
to
all
inferior
clergy
throughout
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
arbitrary
it
may
be
,
but
it
be
excellent
in
intention
;
for
stubborn
-
necked
personage
have
to
be
deal
with
,
with
whom
milder
measure
would
have
prove
ineffectual
.
<EOS>
as
it
be
,
violent
opposition
be
raise
against
the
decree
,
and
the
Puritanical
preacher
wear
loud
in
its
condemnation
,
and
as
far
as
be
consistent
with
safety
,
vehement
in
their
attack
upon
its
royal
author
.
<EOS>
the
boon
,
however
,
be
accept
by
the
majority
of
the
people
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
be
offer
,
and
the
licence
afford
them
be
but
little
abused
.
<EOS>
perfect
success
,
indeed
,
must
have
attend
the
benign
measure
,
have
it
not
be
for
the
effort
of
the
puritanical
and
popish
party
,
who
make
common
cause
against
it
,
and
strove
by
every
means
to
counteract
its
beneficial
influence
:
<EOS>
the
first
because
in
the
austerity
of
their
faith
they
would
not
have
the
Sabbath
in
the
slight
degree
profane
,
even
by
innocent
enjoyment
;
the
second
,
not
because
they
care
about
the
fancy
desecration
of
the
Lord
's
day
,
but
because
they
would
have
no
other
religion
enjoy
the
same
privilege
as
their
own
.
<EOS>
thus
sectarianism
and
intolerance
go
for
once
hand
in
hand
,
and
openly
or
covertly
,
as
they
find
occasion
,
do
their
good
to
make
the
people
dissatisfy
with
the
benefit
accord
them
,
try
to
persuade
them
its
acceptance
would
prejudice
their
eternal
welfare
.
<EOS>
such
argument
,
however
,
have
no
great
weight
with
the
masse
,
who
could
not
be
bring
to
see
any
heinous
or
deadly
sin
in
lawful
recreation
or
exercise
after
divine
service
,
always
provide
the
service
itself
be
in
no
respect
neglect
;
and
so
the
King
's
decree
prevail
over
all
sectarian
opposition
,
and
be
fully
carry
out
.
<EOS>
the
merry
month
of
May
become
really
a
season
of
enjoyment
,
and
be
keep
as
a
kind
of
floral
festival
in
every
village
throughout
the
land
.

and

be
not

permit
on
Sundays
by
the
authority
,

enjoin

<EOS>
these
preliminary
remark
be
make
for
the
well
understanding
of
what
be
to
follow
.
<EOS>
We
have
already
state
that
long
before
Jocelyn

his

reach
Tottenham
,
they
be
make
aware
by
the
ringing
of
bell
from

ivy

grow
church
tower
,
and
by
other
joyful
sound
,
that
some
festival
be
take
place
there
;
and
the
nature
of
the
festival
be
at
once
reveal

as
they
enter
the
long
straggle
street
,
then
,
as
now
,
constitute
the
chief
part
of
the
pretty
little
village
,
and
beheld
a
large
assemblage
of
country
folk
,
in
holiday
attire
,
wend
their
way
towards
the
green
for
the
purpose
of
set
up
a
May
-
pole
upon
it
,
and
make
the
welkin
re
with
their
gladsome
shout
.
<EOS>
all
the
youth
and
maiden
of
Tottenham
and
its
vicinity
,
it
appear

daybreak
that
morning
,
and
sally
forth
into
the
wood
to
cut
green
bough
,
and

flower

for
the
ceremonial

<EOS>
at
the

time
they
select
and
hew
down
a
tall
,
straight
tree
—
the
tall
and
straight
they
could
find
;
and
,
strip
off
its
branch
,
place
it
on
a
wain
,
and
drag
it
to
the
village
with
the
help
of
an
immense
team
of

and

with

<EOS>
the
foremost
yoke
of
oxen
have
bell
hang
round
their
neck
,
which
they
shake
as
they
move
along
,
add
their
blithe
melody
to
the
general
hilarious
sound

<EOS>
when
the
festive
throng

the
village
,
all
its

—
male

and
otherwise

at

comely
bust
.
<EOS>
a
wreath
of
natural
flower
be
twine
very
gracefully
within
her
waving
and
almost
lint
-
white
lock
,
and
in
her
hand
she
hold
a
shepherdess
's
crook
.
<EOS>
such
be
the
Beauty
of
Tottenham
,
and
the
present
queen
of
the
May
Dick
Taverner
<EOS>
think
her
little
less
than
angelic
,
and
there
be
many
besides
who
share
in
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
if
Dick
have
be
thus
captivate
on
the
sudden
,
Jocelyn
have
not
escape
similar
fascination
from
another
quarter
.
<EOS>
It
befel
in
this
way
:
at
an
open
oriel
window
,
in
one
of
the
ancient
and
picturesque
habitation
before
describe
as
face
the
green
,
stand
a
young
maiden
,
whose
beauty
be
of
so
high
an
order
,
and
so
peculiar
a
character
,
<EOS>
that
it
at
once
attract
and
fix
attention
.
<EOS>
such
,
at
least
,
be
the
effect
produce
by
it
on
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
shrink
from
the
public
gaze
,
and
,
perhaps
,
from
some
motive
connect
with
religious
scruple
,
scarcely
deem
it
right
to
be
a
spectator
of
the
passing
scene
,
this
fair
maiden
be
so
place
as
to
be
almost
screen
from
general
view
.
<EOS>
yet
it
chance
that
Jocelyn
,
from
the
circumstance
of
be
on
horseback
,
and
from
his
position
,
be
able
to
command
a
portion
of
the
room
in
which
she
stand
;
and
he
watch
her
for
some
minute
before
she
become
aware
she
be
the
object
of
his
regard
.
<EOS>
when
,
at
length
,
she
perceive
that
his
gaze
be
steadily
fix
upon
her
,
<EOS>
a
deep
blush
suffuse
her
cheek
,
and
she
would
have
instantly
retire
,
if
the
young
man
have
not
at
once
lower
his
look
.
<EOS>
still
,
he
ever
and
anon
venture
a
glance
towards
the
oriel
window
,
and
be
delighted
to
find
the
maiden
still
there,—nay
,
he
fancy
she
must
have
advance
a
step
or
two
,
for
he
could
unquestionably
distinguish
her
feature
more
plainly
.
<EOS>
and
lovely
they
be
—
most
lovely
!
<EOS>
pensive
in
expression
,
and
perhaps
a
thought
too
pale
,
until
the
crimsoning
tide
have
mount
to
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
thus
mantle
with
blush
,
her
countenance
may
gain
something
in
beauty
,
but
it
lose
much
of
the
peculiar
charm
which
it
derive
from
extreme
transparency
and
whiteness
of
skin
—
a
tint
which
set
off
to
perfection
the
splendour
of
her
magnificent
black
eye
,
with
their
darkly
-
fringed
lid
and
brow
,
while
it
also
relieve
,
in
an
equal
degree
,
the
jetty
lustre
of
her
hair
.
<EOS>
Her
feature
be
exquisitely
chisel
,
delicate
and
classical
in
mould
,
and
stamp
with
refinement
and
intelligence
.
<EOS>
perfect
simplicity
,
combine
with
a
total
absence
of
personal
ornament
,
distinguish
her
attire
;
and
her
raven
hair
be
plainly
,
but
by
no
means
unbecomingly
,
braid
over
her
snowy
forehead
.
<EOS>
something
in
this
simplicity
of
costume
and
in
her
manner
incline
Jocelyn
to
think
the
fair
maiden
must
belong
to
some
family
profess
puritanical
opinion
;
and
he
find
,
upon
inquiry
from
one
of
his
neighbour
in
the
throng
—
an
old
farmer
—
that
this
be
actually
the
case
.
<EOS>
the
young
lady
be
Mistress
Aveline
Calveley
,
his
informant
say
,
only
child
of
Master
Hugh
Calveley
,
who
have
but
lately
come
to
dwell
in
Tottenham
,
and
of
whom
little
be
know
,
save
that
he
be
understand
to
have
fight
at
the
battle
of
Langside
,
and
serve
with
great
bravery
,
under
Essex
,
both
in
Spain
and
in
Ireland
,
in
the
time
of
good
Queen
Bess
—
such
time
as
England
would
never
see
again
,
the
old
farmer
parenthetically
remark
,
with
a
shake
of
the
head
.
<EOS>
Master
Hugh
Calveley
,
he
go
on
to
say
,
be
a
strict
Puritan
,
austere
in
his
life
,
and
morose
in
manner
;
an
open
railer
against
the
licence
of
the
time
,
and
the
profligacy
of
the
court
minions,—in
consequence
of
which
he
have
more
than
once
get
himself
into
trouble
.
<EOS>
He
abhor
all
such
sport
as
be
now
go
forward
;
and
have
successfully
interfere
with
the
parish
priest
,
Sir
Onesimus
,
who
be
somewhat
of
a
precisian
himself
,
to
prevent
the
setting
up
the
May
-
pole
on
the
past
Sunday,—for
which
,
the
farmer
add
,
some
of
the
young
folk
owe
him
a
grudge
;
and
he
express
a
hope
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
the
day
may
pass
by
without
any
exhibition
be
make
of
their
ill
-
will
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"these
<EOS>
Puritans
be
not
in
favour
with
our
youth
,
"
the
old
man
say
;
"
and
no
great
marvel
they
be
not
;
for
they
check
them
in
their
pleasure
,
and
reprove
them
for
harmless
mirth
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
to
Mistress
Aveline
herself
,
she
be
devout
and
good
;
but
she
take
no
part
in
the
enjoyment
proper
to
her
year
,
and
lead
a
life
more
like
a
nun
in
a
convent
,
or
a
recluse
in
a
cell
,
than
a
marriageable
young
lady
.
<EOS>
She
never
stir
forth
without
her
father
,
and
,
as
you
may
suppose
,
go
more
frequently
to
lecture
,
or
to
church
,
or
to
some
conventicle
,
than
anywhere
else
.
<EOS>
such
a
life
would
not
suit
my
grandchild
,
Gillian
,
at
all
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
Mistress
Aveline
be
a
sweet
young
lady
,
much
beloved
for
her
kindness
and
goodness
;
and
her
gentle
word
have
heal
many
a
wound
occasion
by
the
harsh
speech
and
severe
reproofs
of
her
father
.
<EOS>
there
,
sir,—you
may
behold
her
fair
and
saintly
countenance
now
.
<EOS>
She
seem
pleased
with
the
scene
,
and
I
be
sure
she
well
may
be
;
for
it
be
always
a
pleasant
and
a
heart
-
cheer
sight
to
see
folk
happy
and
enjoy
themselves
;
and
I
can
not
think
that
the
beneficent
power
above
ever
intend
we
should
make
ourselves
miserable
on
earth
,
in
order
to
win
a
place
in
heaven
.
<EOS>
I
be
an
old
man
,
Sir
;
and
feel
this
to
be
true
,
I
have
ever
inculcate
my
opinion
upon
my
child
and
grandchild
.
<EOS>
yet
I
confess
I
be
surprised
—
know
what
I
do
of
her
father
's
character
—
that
Mistress
Aveline
should
indulge
herself
with
behold
this
profane
spectacle
,
which
ought
,
by
right
,
to
be
odious
in
her
eye
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
latter
part
of
this
speech
be
utter
with
a
sly
chuckle
on
the
part
of
the
old
farmer
,
not
altogether
agreeable
to
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
the
grow
interest
he
feel
in
the
fair
Puritan
render
him
susceptible
.
<EOS>
the
eye
of
the
two
young
person
have
meet
again
more
than
once
,
and
be
not
quite
so
quickly
withdraw
on
either
side
as
before
;
perhaps
,
because
Aveline
be
less
alarm
by
the
young
man
's
appearance
,
or
more
attract
by
it
;
and
perhaps
,
on
his
part
,
because
he
have
grow
a
little
bolder
.
<EOS>
We
know
not
how
this
may
be
;
but
we
do
know
that
the
fair
Puritan
have
gradually
advance
towards
the
front
of
the
window
,
and
be
now
lean
slightly
out
of
it
,
so
that
her
charm
of
face
and
figure
be
more
fully
reveal
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
May
-
pole
have
be
plant
,
and
the
first
dance
round
it
conclude
.
<EOS>
at
its
close
,
Gillian
,
quit
her
post
of
honour
near
the
tree
,
and
leave
the
morrice
-
dancer
and
mummer
to
resume
their
merry
round
,
unsanctione
by
her
sovereign
presence
,
take
a
tambourine
from
one
of
the
minstrel
,
and
proceed
to
collect
gratuity
within
it
intend
for
the
hire
performer
in
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
successful
in
her
effort
,
as
the
number
of
coin
,
soon
visible
within
the
tambourine
,
show
.
<EOS>
not
without
blush
and
some
hesitation
do
the
May
Queen
approach
Dick
Taverner
.
<EOS>
the
'
prentice
make
a
pretence
of
fumbling
in
his
pouch
in
order
to
prolong
the
interview
,
which
chance
have
thus
procure
him
;
and
after
utter
all
the
complimentary
phrase
he
could
muster
,
and
look
a
great
deal
more
than
he
say
,
he
wind
up
his
speech
by
declare
he
would
bestow
a
mark
(
and
that
be
no
slight
sum
,
for
the
high
coin
yet
give
be
a
silver
groat
)
upon
the
minstrel
,
if
they
would
play
a
lively
dance
for
him
,
and
she
,
the
May
Queen
,
would
grace
him
with
her
hand
in
it
.
<EOS>
encourage
by
the
laughter
of
the
bystander
,
and
doubtless
entertain
no
great
dislike
to
the
proposal
,
Gillian
,
with
a
little
affected
coyness
,
consent
;
and
the
mark
be
immediately
deposit
in
the
tambourine
by
Dick
,
who
,
transport
by
his
success
,
spring
from
his
saddle
,
and
commit
his
steed
to
the
care
of
a
youth
near
him
,
whom
he
promise
to
reward
for
his
trouble
,
follow
close
after
the
May
Queen
,
as
she
proceed
with
her
collection
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
she
come
to
Jocelyn
,
and
hold
out
the
tambourine
towards
him
.
<EOS>
an
idea
just
then
occur
to
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
"You
have
a
pretty
nosegay
there
,
fair
maiden
,
"
he
say
,
point
to
a
bunch
of
pink
and
other
fragrant
flower
in
her
breast
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
buy
it
from
you
,
if
you
list
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
shall
have
it
and
welcome
,
fair
Sir
,
"
Gillian
reply
,
detach
the
bouquet
from
her
dress
,
and
offer
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
"well
do
,
Gillian
,
"
the
old
farmer
cry
approvingly
.
<EOS>
"Ah

"
<EOS>
the
May

exclaim
.
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
while
old
Greenford
search
for
a
small
coin
,
Jocelyn
place
a
piece
of
silver
in
the
tambourine
.
<EOS>
"will

""You

could

Jocelyn

crook
hold
it
up

military

CHAPTER
XV.Hugh
Calveley
.
<EOS>
Jocelyn
at
once
comprehend
that
the
person
who
have
thus
dash
the
nosegay
to
the
ground
could
be
no
other
than
Hugh
Calveley
.
<EOS>
but
all
doubt
on
the
point
be
remove
by
Aveline
herself
who
exclaim
in
a
reproachful
tone—"o
father
!
<EOS>
what
<EOS>
have
you
done?""what
have
I
do
?
"
<EOS>
the
Puritan
rejoin
,
speak
in
a
loud
voice
,
as
if
desirous
that
his
word
should
reach
the
assemblage
outside
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
do
that
which
thou
thyself
should'st
have
do
,
Aveline
.
<EOS>
I
have
signify
my
abhorrence
of
this
vain
ceremonial
.
<EOS>
but
wherefore
do
I
find
you
here
?
<EOS>
this
be
no
fitting
sight
for
any
discreet
maiden
to
witness
;
and
little
<EOS>
do
I
think
that
daughter
of
mine
would
encourage
such
profane
display
by
her
presence
.
<EOS>
little
do
I
think
that
you
,
Aveline
,
would
look
on
and
smile
while
these
ignorant
and
benighted
folk
set
up
their
idol
,
piping
,
dancing
,
and
singe
around
it
as
the
Gentiles
do
at
the
dedication
of
their
deity
.
<EOS>
for
it
be
an
idol
they
have
set
up
,
and
they
have
become
like
the
heathen
,
worshipper
of
stock
and
stone
.
<EOS>
be
we
not
expressly
forbid
by
the
Holy
Scriptures
to
make
unto
ourselves
idol
and
graven
image
?
<EOS>
the
sin
of
idolatry
and
superstition
will
assuredly
provoke
the
Divine
displeasure
,
and
kindle
the
fire
of
its
wrath
,
as
they
do
in
the
day
of
Moses
,
after
the
worshipping
of
the
golden
Calf
by
the
Israelites
.
<EOS>
thus
spake
offend
heaven:—'let
me
alone
that
my
wrath
may
wax
hot
against
them
,
and
that
I
may
consume
them
.
'
<EOS>
grievously
will
the

""Nay
<EOS>
,
dear

I

<EOS>
I
must
frankly
own
that
it
be
pleasant
to
me
to
witness
such
innocent
enjoyment
as
be
here
exhibit
;
while
as
to
yon
May

pole
,
with
its
pretty
floral
decoration
,
I
can
never
be
bring
to
regard
it
as
an
emblem
of
superstition
and
idolatry
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
have
you
command
me
to
refrain
from
the
sight
,
I
would
unhesitatingly
have
obey
you

I
think
I
be

inclination

""Why
<EOS>
so
you
be

child
<EOS>

the

I

full
reliance
on
you

do
not
conceive

could
have
be
so
easily
beguile
by
Satan

<EOS>
I
lament
to
find
you
can
not
discern
the
superstition
and
wickedness
lurk
within
this
false

though
fair

seem
spectacle

<EOS>
do
you
not
perceive
that
in
set
up
this
wooden
idol
,
and
worship
it
,
these
people
be
return
to
the
dark
and
sinful
practice
of
Paganism
of
which
it
be
an
undoubted
remnant
?
<EOS>
if
you
can
not
discern
this
,
I
will
make
it
manifest
to
you
anon
.
<EOS>

I
tell
you
now
briefly
,
"
he
continue

a
voice

that
the
ceremony

impious
;
that
those
who
take
part
in
it

idolater

and
that
those

look
on

approve

participator

it

to
me

easy
to

from
the
angry
countenance
of
his
hearer
<EOS>
what
be
the
effect
of
the
address
upon
them

<EOS>
when
he
have

Hugh

fold
his
arm
upon
his
breast
,
and

regard
the
assemblage

<EOS>
He

stricken

as
his
grizzle

there
be
great
determination
about

about
the
physiognomy
generally
,
while
at
the
same
time
there
be
something
of
the
wildness
of
fanaticism
in
his
look
.
<EOS>
He
be

You

Hugh

a
deep
groan
be

the
desire

vengeance

obtain
some
honourable
employment

"My

chance
in

weary

sharp

as
I
could

CHAPTER
XVIII.How
the
promise
be
cancel
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
large
garden
,
once
fairly
lay
out
and
plant
,
but
now
sadly
neglect
.
<EOS>
the
broad
terrace
walk
be
overgrow
with
weed
;
the
stone
step
and
the
carve
baluster
be
break
in
place
,
and
cover
with
moss
;
the
once
smooth
lawn
be
unconscious
of
the
scythe
;
the
parterre
have
lose
their
quaint
device
;
and
the
knot
of
flower
—
tre
-
foil
,
cinque
-
foil
,
diamond
,
and
cross
-
bow
—
be
no
longer
distinguishable
in
their
original
shape
.
<EOS>
the
labyrinth
of
the
maze
be
inextricably
tangle
,
and
the
long
green
alley
want
clear
out
.
<EOS>
but
all
this
neglect
pass
unnoticed
by
Jocelyn
,
so
completely
be
he
engross
by
the
fair
creature
at
his
side
.
<EOS>
even
the
noise
of
the
May
Games
,
which
,
temporarily
interrupt
by
Hugh
Calveley
,
have
recommence
with
great
vigour
than
ever
—
the
ringing
of
the
church
bell
,
the
shout
of
the
crowd
,
and
the
sound
of
the
merry
minstrelsy
,
scarcely
reach
his
ear
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
he
experience
those
delicious
sensation
which
new
-
bear
love
excite
within
the
breast
;
and
the
enchantment
operate
upon
him
so
rapidly
and
so
strongly
,
that
he
be
overpower
by
its
spell
almost
before
aware
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
seem
that
he
have
never
really
live
till
this
moment
;
never
,
at
least
,
comprehend
the
bliss
afford
by
existence
in
the
companionship
of
a
be
able
to
awaken
the
transport
he
now
experience
.
<EOS>
a
new
world
seem
suddenly
open
to
him
,
full
of
love
,
hope
,
sunshine
,
of
which
he
and
Aveline
be
the
sole
inhabitant
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
his
life
have
be
devoid
of
any
great
emotion
.
<EOS>
the
one
feeling
latterly
pervade
it
have
be
a
sense
of
deep
wrong
,
couple
with
the
thirst
of
vengeance
.
<EOS>
no
tenderer
influence
have
soften
his
almost
rugged
nature
;
and
his
breast
continue
arid
as
the
desert
.
<EOS>
now
the
rock
have
be
stricken
,
and
the
live
water
gush
forth
abundantly
.
<EOS>
not
that
in
Norfolk
,
and
even
in
the
remote
part
of
the
county
where
his
life
have
be
pass
,
female
beauty
be
rare
.
<EOS>
nowhere
,
indeed
,
be
the
flower
of
loveliness
more
thickly
sow
than
in
that
favour
part
of
our
isle
.
<EOS>
but
all
such
young
damsel
as
he
have
behold
have
fail
to
move
him
;
and
if
any
shaft
have
be
aim
at
his
breast
it
have
fall
wide
of
the
mark
.
<EOS>
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
be
not
one
of
those
highly
susceptible
nature
—
quick
to
receive
an
impression
,
quick
to
lose
it
.
<EOS>
neither
would
he
have
be
readily
catch
by
the
lur
spread
for
youth
by
the
designing
of
the
sex
.
<EOS>
imbue
with
something
of
the
antique
spirit
of
chivalry
,
which
yet
,
though
but
slightly
,
influence
the
age
in
which
he
live
,
he
be
ready
and
able
to
pay
fervent
homage
to
his
mistress
's
sovereign
beauty
(
supposing
he
have
one
)
,
and
maintain
its
supremacy
against
all
questioner
,
but
utterly
incapable
of
worship
at
any
mean
shrine
.
<EOS>
heart
-
whole
,
therefore
,
when
he
encounter
the
Puritan
's
daughter
,
he
feel
that
in
her
he
have
find
an
object
he
have
long
seek
,
to
whom
he
could
devote
himself
heart
and
soul
;
a
maiden
whose
beauty
be
without
peer
,
and
whose
mental
quality
correspond
with
her
personal
attraction
.
<EOS>
nor
be
it
a
delusion
under
which
he
labour
.
<EOS>
Aveline
Calveley
be
all
his
imagination
paint
her
.
<EOS>
purity
of
heart
,
gentleness
of
disposition
,
intellectual
endowment
,
be
as
clearly
reveal
by
her
speak
countenance
as
the
innermost
depth
of
a
fountain
be
by
the
pellucid
medium
through
which
they
be
view
.
<EOS>
Hers
be
a
virgin
heart
,
which
,
like
his
own
,
have
receive
no
previous
impression
.
<EOS>
love
for
her
father
alone
have
sway
her
;
though
all
strong
demonstration
of
filial
affection
have
be
check
by
that
father
's
habitually
stern
manner
.
<EOS>
bring
up
by
a
female
relative
in
Cheshire
,
who
have
take
charge
of
her
on
her
mother
's
death
,
which
have
occur
during
her
infancy
,
she
have
know
little
of
her
father
till
late
year
,
when
she
have
come
to
reside
with
him
,
and
,
though
devout
by
nature
,
she
could
ill
reconcile
herself
to
the
gloomy
notion
of
religion
he
entertain
,
or
to
the
ascetic
mode
of
life
he
practise
.
<EOS>
with
no
desire
to
share
in
the
pomp
and
vanity
of
life
,
she
could
not
be
persuade
that
cheerfulness
be
incompatible
with
righteousness
;
nor
could
all
the
railing
she
hear
against
them
make
her
hate
those
who
differ
from
her
in
religious
opinion
.
<EOS>
still
she
make
no
complaint
.
<EOS>
entirely
obedient
to
her
father
's
will
,
she
accommodate
herself
,
as
far
as
she
could
,
to
the
rule
of
life
prescribe
by
him
.
<EOS>
aware
of
his
pertinacity
of
opinion
,
she
seldom
or
ever
argue
a
point
with
him
,
even
if
she
think
right
may
be
on
her
side
;
hold
it
better
to
maintain
peace
by
submission
,
than
to
hazard
wrath
by
disputation
.
<EOS>
the
discussion
on
the
May
Games
be
an
exception
to
her
ordinary
conduct
,
and
form
one
of
the
few
instance
in
which
she
have
venture
to
assert
her
own
opinion
in
opposition
to
that
of
her
father
.
<EOS>
of
late
,
indeed
,
she
have
feel
great
uneasiness
about
him
.
<EOS>
much
changed
,
he
seem
occupy
by
some
dark
,
dread
think
,
which
partially
reveal
itself
in
wrathful
exclamation
and
muttered
menace
.
<EOS>
He
seem
to
believe
himself
choose
by
Heaven
as
an
instrument
of
vengeance
against
oppression
;
and
her
fear
be
excited
lest
he
may
commit
some
terrible
act
under
this
fatal
impression
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
more
confirmed
in
the
idea
from
the
eagerness
with
which
he
have
grasp
at
Jocelyn
's
rash
promise
,
and
she
determine
to
put
the
young
man
upon
his
guard
.
<EOS>
if
,
in
order
to
satisfy
the
reader
's
curiosity
,
we
be
oblige
to
examine
the
state
of
Aveline
's
heart
,
in
reference
to
Jocelyn
,
we
must
state
candidly
that
no
such
ardent
flame
be
kindle
within
it
as
burn
in
the
breast
of
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
that
such
a
flame
may
arise
be
very
possible
,
nay
even
probable
,
see
that
the
spark
of
love
be
there
;
and
material
for
combustion
be
by
no
mean
want
.
<EOS>
all
that
be
require
be
,
that
those
spark
should
be
gently
fan
—
not
heedlessly
extinguish
.
<EOS>
Little
be
say
by
the
two
young
person
,
as
they
slowly
pace
the
terrace
.
<EOS>
both
feel
embarrassed
:
Jocelyn
long
to
give
utterance
to
his
feeling
,
but
restrain
by
timidity
—
<EOS>
aveline
tremble
lest
more
may
be
say
than
she
ought
to
hear
,
or
if
oblige
to
hear
,
than
she
could
rightly
answer
.
<EOS>
thus
they
walk
on
in
silence
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
silence
more
eloquent
than
word
,
since
each
comprehend
what
the
other
feel
.
<EOS>
how
much
they
would
have
say
be
proclaim
by
the
impossibility
they
find
of
say
anything!at
length
,
Jocelyn
stop
,
and
pluck
a
flower

,
as
he
proffer
it
for
her
acceptance

a
sad
,
sweet
smile

<EOS>
"

I

this

your

with
its

so
often

;
come
into
possession
of
James
the
First
,
in
the
manner
we
shall
proceed
to
relate
,
some
year
before
the
date
of
this
history
.
<EOS>
James
first
make
acquaintance
with
Theobalds
during
his
progress
from
Scotland
to
assume
the
english
crown
,
and
it
be
the
last
point
at
which
he
halt
before
enter
the
capital
of
his
new
dominion
.
<EOS>
here
,
for
four
day
,
he
and
his
crowd
of
noble
attendant
be
guest
of
Sir
Robert
Cecil
,
afterwards
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
who
prove
himself
the
worthy
son
of
his
illustrious
and
hospitable
sire
by
entertain
the
monarch
and
his
numerous
train
in
the
same
princely
style
that
the
Lord
Treasurer
have
ever
display
towards
Queen
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
an
eyewitness
have
describe
the
King
's
arrival
at
Theobalds
on
this
occasion
.
"
<EOS>
thus
,
then
,
"
say
John
Savile
,
"
for
his
Majesty
be
come
up
the
walk
,
there
come
before
him
some
of
the
nobility
,
baron
,
knight
,
esquire
,
gentleman
,
and
other
,
amongst
whom
be
the
sheriff
of
Essex
,
and
most
of
his
man
,
the
trumpet
sound
next
before
his
highness
,
sometimes
one
,
sometimes
another
;
his
Majesty
ride
not
continually
betwixt
the
same
two
,
but
sometimes
one
,
sometimes
another
,
as
seem
good
to
his
highness
;
the
whole
nobility
of
our
land
and
Scotland
round
about
him
observe
no
place
of
superiority
,
all
bare
-
head
,
all
of
whom
alight
from
their
horse
at
their
entrance
into
the
first
court
,
save
only
his
Majesty
alone
,
who
rid
along
still
,
four
nobleman
lay
their
hand
upon
his
steed
,
two
before
and
two
behind
.
<EOS>
in
this
manner
he
come
to
the
court
door
,
where
I
myself
stand
.
<EOS>
at
the
entrance
into
that
court
stand
many
nobleman
,
amongst
whom
be
Sir
Robert
Cecil
,
who
there
meet
his
Majesty
conduct
him
into
his
house
,
all
which
be
practise
with
as
great
applause
of
the
people
as
could
be
,
hearty
prayer
,
and
throw
up
of
hat
.
<EOS>
His
Majesty
have
not
stay
above
an
hour
in
his
chamber
,
but
hear
the
multitude
throng
so
fast
into
the
uppermost
court
to
see
his
highness
,
he
show
himself
openly
out
of
his
chamber
window
by
the
space
of
half
an
hour
together
;
after
which
time
he
go
into
the
labyrinth
-
like
garden
to
walk
,
where
he
secrete
himself
in
the
Meander
's
compact
of
bay
,
rosemary
,
and
the
like
overshadow
his
walk
,
to
defend
him
from
the
heat
of
the
sun
till
supper
time
,
at
which
be
such
plenty
of
provision
for
all
sort
of
man
in
their
due
place
as
strike
me
with
admiration
.
<EOS>
and
first
,
to
begin
with
the
ragged
regiment
,
and
such
as
be
debar
the
privilege
of
any
court
,
these
be
so
sufficiently
reward
with
beef
,
veal
,
mutton
,
bread
,
and
beer
,
that
they
sing
holiday
every
day
,
and
keep
a
continual
feast
.
<EOS>
as
for
poor
maimed
and
distressed
soldier
,
which
repair
thither
for
maintenance
,
the
wine
,
money
,
and
meat
which
they
have
in
very
bounteous
sort
,
hath
become
a
sufficient
spur
to
them
to
blaze
it
abroad
since
their
come
to
London
.
<EOS>
"
the
reader
will
marvel
at
the
extraordinary
and
unstinte
hospitality
practise
in
those
day
,
which
,
as
we
have
show
,
be
exhibit
to
all
comer
,
irrespective

and
which
extend
its
bounty
in
the
shape
of

to
the
wounded
and
disabled
veteran
.
<EOS>
We
find
no
parallel
to
it
in
modern
time
.
<EOS>
theobald
produce
a
highly
favourable
impression
upon
James
,
who
,
passionately
attach
to
the
chase
,
see
in
its
well
-
stock
park
the
mean
of
gratify
his
taste
to
the
full
extent
.
<EOS>
Its
contiguity
to
Enfield
Chase
be
also
a
great
recommendation
;
and
its
situation
,
beautiful
in
itself
,
be
retire
,
and
yet
within
easy
distance
of
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
It
appear
to
him
to
combine
all
the
advantage
of
a
royal
hunting
-
seat
with
all
the
splendour
of
a
palace
;
and
his
predilection
be
confirm
by
a
second
visit
pay
by
him
to
it
in
1606
,
when
he
be
accompany
by
his
brother
-
in
-
law
,
Christianus
,
King
of
Denmark
,
and
when
the
two
monarchs
be
gloriously
entertain
by
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
the
danish
king
drink
inordinately
;
so
do
the
whole
of
his
suite
:
and
they
soon
inoculate
the
English
Court
with
their
sottish
taste
.
<EOS>
Bonnie
King
Jamie
himself
get
fou
twice
a

day
;
and
,
melancholy
to
relate
,
the
lady
of
the
Court
follow
the
royal
example
,
and
,
"
abandon
their
sobriety
,
be
see
to
roll
about
in
intoxication
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
Sir
John
Harington
,
who
have
give
a
very
diverting
account
of
the
orgy
at
Theobalds
,
and
the
inebriate
extravagance
of
Christianus
.
<EOS>
"
one
day
,
"
write
Sir
John
,
"
a
great
feast
be

and
after
dinner
the

of
Solomon

the
coming
of
the
Queen

or
(
as
I
may
better
say
)
be

to
have
be
make
before
their
Majesties
,
by
device
of
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
and
other

<EOS>
but
alas

<EOS>
as
all
earthly
thing
do
fail

<EOS>
the

the

carry
most
precious
gift

both
their
majesty

forget
the
step
arise
to
the
canopy

overset
her
casket
into
his
Danish
Majesty
's
lap

fall
at
his

it

the
hurry

confusion

<EOS>
cloth
and
napkin

all
clean

<EOS>
His
Majesty
then
get
up

and
would
dance
with
the
Queen
of
Sheba
;
but
he
fall
down
and
humble
himself
before
her

be
carry
to
an
inner

lay
on

the

"
<EOS>
Worthy
Sir
John
seem
to
have
be
greatly
scandalize
,
as
he
well
may
be

at
these
shameless
proceeding

he
exclaim
pathetically

"
the

"
<EOS>
nor
do

fail
to
contrast
these
"
strange
pageantry
"
with
what
occur
of
the

sort
,
in
the

place

in
Queen
Elizabeth

"have
<EOS>
set
his
heart
upon
Theobalds
,
James
offer
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
in
exchange
for
it
,
the
palace
and
domain
of
Hatfield
;
and
the
proposal
be
accept
(
it
could
not
very
well
be
refuse
)
,
the
delivery
of
the
much
-
covet
place
be
make
on
the
22nd
May

1607

the
Prince
Joinville
,
brother
to
the
Duke
de
Guise

the
occasion

where
fresh
festivity
be
hold

an
indifferent
Masque
from
Ben
Jonson

<EOS>
whether
the
King
or
the
Earl
have
the
good
of
the
bargain
,
we
be
not
prepared

decide

<EOS>
enchant
with
his
acquisition
,
James
commence
the
work
of
improvement
and
embellishment
by
enlarge
the
park
,
appropriate
a
good
slice
of
Enfield
Chace
,
with
part
of
Northaw
and
Cheshunt
Commons
,
and
surround
the
whole
with
a
high
brick
wall
ten
mile
in
circumference
.
<EOS>
within
this
ring
he
find
ample
scope
for
the
indulgence
of
his
hunting
propensity
,
since
it
contain
an
almost
inexhaustible
stock
of
the
fine
deer
in
the
kingdom
;
and
within
it
may
be
hear
the
sound
of
his
merry
horn
,
and
the
baying
of
his
favourite
stag
-
hound
,
whenever
he
could
escape
from
the
care
of
state
,
or
the
toil
of
the
council

chamber

<EOS>
His
escape
from
these
demand
upon
his
time
be
so
frequent

and
the
attraction
of
the
wood
of
Theobalds
so
irresistible

that
remonstrance

make
to
him
on
the
subject

<EOS>
little

<EOS>
They
let
him
talk
on
,
feign
to
listen

but
in
reality
note
scarce
a
word
he

.
<EOS>
as
they
enter
the
park
of
Theobalds
,
however
,
they
find
their
tongue
,
and
Gillian
become
loud
in
her
admiration
of
the
beautiful
glade
that
open
before
them
,
and
of
the
dappled
denizen
of
the
wood

its

spreading
beech
,
its
scatter
thorn

<EOS>
no

Gillian

delighted

<EOS>
Dick
be

and
regret
he
be
not
like
King
James
,
master
of
a
great
park
,
that
he
may
hunt
within
it
at
his
pleasure
.
<EOS>
of
course
,
if
he
have
be
king
,
Gillian
would
naturally
have
be
his
queen
,
and
have
hunt
with
him
.
<EOS>
Old
Greenford
,
too
,
admire
the
scene
,
and
could
not
but
admit
that
the
park
be
improve
,
though
he
utter
something
like
a
groan
as
he
think
that
Queen
Elizabeth
and
the
Lord
Treasurer
could
be
see
in
it
no
longer
.
<EOS>
after
ride
for
a
couple

mile
along

road
which
lead
them
over
beautifully
undulate
ground
,
afford
glimpse
of
every
variety
of

scenery
—
sometimes
plunge
them
into
the
depth
of
grove
,
where
the
path
be
cover
by

arch
tree
—
sometimes
cross
the
open
chace

stud
by
single
aged
oak
of

sometimes
,
skirt
the

<EOS>
the
strange
event
of
the
morning
give
him
plenty
of
material
for
reflection
,
and
he
long
to
commune
with
himself
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
when
the
other
stop
at
Edmonton
,
he
quit
them
,
promise
to
halt
till
they
come
up
,
before
enter
the
precinct
of

<EOS>
if
his
ride
be
not
so
agreeable
as
their
'
,
it
at
least
enable
him
to
regain
,
in
some
degree
,
his
composure
of
mind
,
which
have
be
greatly
disturb
by
his
abrupt
parting
with
Aveline

<EOS>
Her
image
be
constantly
before
him
,
and
refuse
to
be
dismiss
,
connect
itself
with
every
object
he
behold

<EOS>
at
first
he
despair
of
meet
her
again
;
but
as
he
gradually
grow
calm
,
his
hope
revive
,
and
difficulty
which
seem
insuperable
begin
to
disperse
.
<EOS>
by
the
time
Dick
Taverner
and
his
companion
come
up
,
he
feel
some
disposition
to
talk
,
and
Gillian

hearty
merriment
and
high
spirit
help
to
enliven
him
.
<EOS>
have
ascertain
,
from
one
of

company
,
be
out
hawk
on
the
bank
of
the
New
River
,
which
be
cut
through
the
park
,
and
that
he
would
in
all
probability
return
through
the
great
avenue
to
the
palace
,
he
propose
that
they
should
station
themselves
somewhere
within
it
,
in
order
to
see
him
pass
.
<EOS>
this
arrangement
please
all
party
,
so
proceed
slowly
up
the
avenue
,
they
take
up
a
position
as
describe

<EOS>
More

be
pleased
with
his
sport
,
come
not

<EOS>
without
be

distinction
he
feel
convinced

<EOS>
in

I
have
reason

so
your

perceive
that

still
I
persuade
myself
,
if
I

I

be
able

"You

you

XX.King
<EOS>
James
the

<EOS>
meantime
the
royal
cavalcade
come
slowly
up
the
avenue

<EOS>
It
be
very
numerous
,
and
all
the
more
brilliant
in
appearance
,
since
it
comprise
nearly
as
many
high

bear
dame
as
noble
.
<EOS>
amongst
the
distinguished
foreigner
who
with
their
attendant
swell
the
party
be
the
venetian
lieger
-
ambassador
Giustiniano
,
and
the
Marquis
de

of
the
family
des
Ursins
,
ambassador
from
France

<EOS>
these
exalted
personage
ride
close
behind
the
King
,
and
one
or
the
other
of
them
be
constantly
engage
in
conversation
with
him
.
<EOS>
Giustiniano
have
one
of
those
dark
,
grave
,
handsome
countenance
familiarize
to
us
by
the
portrait
of
Titian
and
Tintoretto
,
and
even
the
King
's
jest
fail
in
make
him
smile
.
<EOS>
He
be
apparelle
entirely
in
black
velvet
,
with
a
cloak
border
with
the
costly
fur
of
the
black
fox
.
<EOS>
all
his
follower
be
similarly
attire
.
<EOS>
the
sombre
Venetian
present
a
striking
contrast
to
his
vivacious
companion
,
the
gay
and
graceful
De
Tremouille
,
who
glitter
in
white
satin
,
embroider
with
leave
of
silver
,
while
the
same
colour
and
the
same
ornament
be
adopt
by
his
retinue
.
<EOS>
no
order
of
precedence
be
observe
by
the
court
noble
.
<EOS>
each
ride
as
he
list
.
<EOS>
Prince
Charles
be
absent
,
and
so
be
the
supreme
favourite
Buckingham
;
but
their
place
be
supply
by
some
of
the
chief
personage
of
the
realm
,
include
the
Earls
of
Arundel
,
Pembroke
,
and
Montgomery
,
the
Marquis
of
Hamilton
,
and
the
Lords
Haddington
,
Fenton
,
and
Doncaster
.
<EOS>
intermingle
with
the
noble
,
the
courtier
of
less
rank
,
and
the
ambassador
'
follower
,
be
the
lady
,
most
of
whom
claim
attention
from
personal
charm
,
rich
attire
,
and
the
grace
and
skill
with
which
they
manage
their
horse
.
<EOS>
perhaps
the
most
beautiful
amongst
them
be
the
young
Countess
of
Exeter
,
whose
magnificent
black
eye
do
great
execution
.
<EOS>
the
lovely
Countess
be
mount
on
a
fiery
spanish
barb
,
give
to
her
by
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
force
into
a
union
with
a
gouty
and
decrepit
old
husband
,
<EOS>
the
Countess
of
Exeter
may
have
plead
this
circumstance
in
extenuation
of
some
of
her
folly
.
<EOS>
It
be
undoubtedly
an
argument
employ
by
her
admirer
,
who
,
in
endeavour
to
shake
her
fidelity
to
her
lord
,
tell
her
it
be
an
infamy
that
she
should
be
sacrifice
to
such
an
old
dotard
as
he
.
<EOS>
whether
these
argument
prevail
in
more
case
than
one
we
shall
not
inquire
too
nicely
;
but
,
if
court
-
scandal
may
be
rely
on
,
they
do
—
<EOS>
Buckingham
and
De
Gondomar
be
both
repute
to
have
be
her
lover
.
<EOS>
the
last
,
however
,
in
the
list
,
and
the
one
who
appear
to
be
most
passionately
enamour
of
the
beautiful
Countess
,
and
to
receive
the
large
share
of
her
regard
,
be
Lord
Roos
;
and
as
this
culpable
attachment
and
its
consequence
connect
themselves
intimately
with
our
history
we
have
be
oblige
to
advert
to
them
thus
particularly
.
<EOS>
Lord
Roos
be
a
near
relative
of
the
Earl
of
Exeter
;
and
although
the
infirm
and
gouty
old
peer
have
be
excessively
jealous
of
his
lovely
young
wife
on
former
occasion
,
when
she
have
appear
to
trifle
with
his
honour
,
he
seem
perfectly
easy
and
unsuspicious
now
,
though
there
be
infinitely
more
cause
for
distrust
.
<EOS>
possibly
he
have
too
much
reliance
on
Lord
Roos
's
good
feeling
and
principle
to
suspect
him
.
<EOS>
very
different
be
Lady
Roos
's
conduct
.
<EOS>
this
unhappy
lady
,
whom
we
have
already
mention
as
the
daughter
of
Sir
Thomas
Lake
,
Secretary
of
State
,
have
the
misfortune
to
be
sincerely
attach
to
her
handsome
but
profligate
husband
,
whose
neglect
and
frequent
irregularity
she
have
pardon
,
until
the
utter
estrangement
,
occasion
by
his
passion
for
the
Countess
of
Exeter
,
fill
her
with
such
trouble
,
that
,
overpower
at
length
by
anguish
,
she
complain
to
her
mother
Lady
<EOS>
Lake,—an
ambitious
and
imperious
woman
,
whose
vanity
have
prompt
her
to
bring
about
this
unfortunate
match
.
<EOS>
express
the
great
indignation
at
the
treatment
her
daughter
have
experience
,
Lady
Lake
counsel
her
to
resent
it
,
undertake
herself
to
open
the
eye
of
the
injure
Earl
of
Exeter
to
his
wife
's
infidelity
;
but
she
be
dissuade
from
her
purpose
by
Sir
Thomas
Lake
.
<EOS>
though
generally
govern
by
his
wife
,
Sir
Thomas
succeed
,
in
this
instance
,
in
over
-
rule
her
design
of
proceed
at
once
to
extremity
with
the
guilty
pair
,
recommend
that
,
in
the
first
instance
,
Lord
Roos
should
be
strongly
remonstrate
with
by
Lady
Lake
and
her
daughter
,
when
perhaps
his
fear
may
be
arouse
,
if
his
sense
of
duty
could
not
be
awaken
.
<EOS>
this
final
appeal
have
not
yet
be
make
;
but
an
interview
have
take
place
between
Lady
Roos
and
her
husband
,
at
which
,
with
many
passionate
entreaty
,
she
have
implore
him
to
shake
off
the
thraldom
in
which
he
have
bind
himself
,
and
to
return
to
her
,
when
all
should
be
forgive
and
forgotten,—but
without
effect
.
<EOS>
thus
matter
stand
at
present
.
<EOS>
as
we
have
see
,
though
the
Countess
of
Exeter
form
one
of
the
chief
ornament
of
the
hawking
party
<EOS>
,
Lord
Roos
have
not
join
it
;
his
absence
be
occasion
by
a
summon
from
the
Conde
de
Gondomar
,
with
some
of
whose
political
intrigue
<EOS>
he
be
secretly
mix
up
.
<EOS>
whether
the
Countess
miss
him
or
not
,
we
pretend
not
to
say
.
<EOS>
all
we
be
able
to
declare
be
,
she
be
in
high
spirit
,
and
seem
in
no
mood
to
check
the
advance
of
other
aspirant
to
her
favour
.
<EOS>
Her
beautiful
and
expressive
feature
beam
with
constant
smile
,
and
her
lustrous
black
eye
seem
to
create
a
flame
wherever
their
beam
alight
.
<EOS>
but
we
must
quit
this
enchantress
and
her
spell
,
and
proceed
with
the
description
of
the
royal
party
.
<EOS>
in
the
rear
of
those
on
horseback
walk
the
falconer
,
in
livery
of
green
cloth
,
with
bugle
hang
from
the
shoulder
;
each
man
have
a
hawk
upon
his
fist
,
completely
'
tired
in
its
hood
,
bell
,
varvel
,
and
jesse
.
<EOS>
at
the
heel
of
the
falconer
,
and
accompany
by
a
throng
of
varlet
,
in
russet
jerkin
,
carry
stave
,
come
two
pack
of
hounds,—one
use
for
what
be
term
,
in
the
language
of
falconry
,
the
Flight
at
the
River,—these
be
all
water
-
spaniel
;
and
the
other
,
for
the
Flight
at
the
field
.
<EOS>
nice
music
they
make
,
in
spite
of
the
effort
of
the
varlet
in
russet
to
keep
them
quiet
.
<EOS>
hawking
,
in
those
day
,
be
what
shooting
be
in
the
present
;
fowl
-
piece
be
scarcely
use
,
if
at
all
.
<EOS>
thus
the
variety
of
the
hawk
-
tribe
be
not
merely
employ
in
the
capture
of
pheasant
,
partridge
,
grouse
,
rail
,
quail
,
and
other
game
,
besides
water
-
fowl
,
but
in
the
chase
of
hare
;
and
in
all
of
these
pursuit
the
falconer
be
assist
by
dog
.
<EOS>
game
,
of
course
,
could
only
be
kill
at
particular
season
of
the
year
;
and
wild
-
geese
,
wild
-
duck
,
woodcock
,
and
snipe
in
the
winter
;
but
spring
and
summer
pastime
be
afford
by
the
crane
,
the
bustard
,
the
heron
,
the
rook
,
and
the
kite
;
while
,
at
the
same
period
,
some
of
the
small
description
of
water
-
fowl
offer
excellent
sport
on
lake
or
river
.
<EOS>
a
striking
and
picturesque
sight
that
cavalcade
present
,
with
its
nodding
plume
of
many
colour
,
its
glitter
silk
and
velvet
,
its
proud
array
of
horseman
,
and
its
still
prouder
array
of
lovely
woman
,
whose
personal
grace
and
charm
baffle
description
,
while
they
invite
it
.
<EOS>
pleasant
be
the
sound
that
accompany
the
progress
of
the
train
:
the
jocund
laugh
,
the
musical
voice
of
woman
,
the
jingling
of
bridle
,
the
snorting
and
trampling
of
steed
,
the
baying
of
hound
,
the
shout
of
the
varlet
,
and
the
winding
of
horn
.
<EOS>
but
have
,
as
yet
,
omit
the
principal
figure
,
we
must
hasten
to
describe
him
by
whom
the
party
be
head
.
<EOS>
the
King
,
then
,
be
mount
on
a
superb
milk
-
white
steed
,
with
wide
-
flow
mane
and
tail
,
and
of
the
easy
and
gentle
pace
.
<EOS>
Its
colour
be
set
off
by
its
red
chanfrein
,
its
nodding
crest
of
red
feather
,
its
broad
poitrinal
with
red
tassel
,
and
its
saddle
with
red
housing
.
<EOS>
though
devote
to
the
chase
,
as
we
have
show
,
James
be
but
an
indifferent
horseman
;
and
his
safety
in
the
saddle
be
assure
by
such
high
-
bolster
bow
in
front
and
at
the
back
,
that
it
seem
next
to
impossible
he
could
be
shake
out
of
them
.
<EOS>
yet
,
in
spite
of
all
these
precaution
,
accident
have
befall
him
.
<EOS>
on
one
occasion
,
Sir
Symonds
D'Ewes
relate
that
he
be
throw
headlong
into
a
pond
;
and
on
another
,
we
learn
from
a
different
source
that
he
be
cast
over
his
horse
's
head
into
the
New
River
,
and
narrowly
escape
drown
,
his
boot
alone
be
visible
above
the
ice
cover
the
stream
.
<EOS>
moreover
the
monarch
's
attire
be
excessively
stiff
and
cumbrous
,
and
this
,
while
it
add
to
the
natural
ungainliness
of
his
person
,
prevent
all
freedom
of
movement
,
especially
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
His
doublet
,
which
on
the
present
occasion
be
of
green
velvet
,
considerably
frayed,—for
<EOS>
he
be
by
no
means
particular
about
the
newness
of
his
apparel,—wa
padded
and
quilt
so
as
to
be
dagger
-
proof
;
and
his
hose
be
stuff
in
the
same
manner
,
and
preposterously
large
about
the
hip
.
<EOS>
then
his
ruff
be
triple
-
banded
,
and
so
stiffly
starched
,
that
the
head
be
fix
immovably
amidst
its
plait
.
<EOS>
though
not
handsome
,
James
's
feature
be
thoughtful
and
intelligent
,
with
a
gleam
of
cunne
in
the
eye
,
and
an
expression
of
sarcasm
about
the
mouth
,
and
they
contain
the
type
of
the
peculiar
physiognomy
that
distinguish
all
his
unfortunate
line
.
<EOS>
His
beard
be
of
a
yellowish
brown
,
and
scantily
cover
his
chin
,
and
his
thin
moustache
be
of
a
yet
light
hue
.
<EOS>
His
hair
be
begin
to
turn
gray
,
but
his
complexion
be
ruddy
and
hale
,
prove
that
,
but
for
his
constant
ebriety
and
indulgence
in
the
pleasure
of
the
table
,
he
may
have
attain
a
good
old
age
—
if
,
indeed
,
his
life
be
not
unfairly
abridge
.
<EOS>
His
large
eye
be
for
ever
roll
about
,
and
his
tongue
be
too
big
for
his
mouth
,
cause
him
to
splutter
in
utterance
,
besides
give
him
a
disagreeable
appearance
when
eat
;
while
his
leg
be
so
weak
,
that
he
require
support
in
walk
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
these
defect
,
and
his
general
coarseness
of
manner
,
James
be
not
without
dignity
,
and
could
,
when
he
choose
,
assume
a
right
royal
air
and
deportment
.
<EOS>
but
these
occasion
be
rare
.
<EOS>
as
be
well
known
,
his
pedantry
and
his
pretension
to
superior
wisdom
and
discrimination
,
procure
him
the
title
of
the
"
Scottish
Solomon
.
"
<EOS>
His
general
character
will
be
more
fully
develop
as
we
proceed
;
and
we
shall
show
the
perfidy
and
dissimulation
which
he
practise
in
carry
out
his
scheme
,
and
try
to
soften
down
under
the
plausible
appellation
of
"
King
-

CHAPTER
XXIV.The
Fountain
Court
.
<EOS>
on
the
morning
after
the
eventful
passage
in
his
life
,
previously
relate
,
our
newly
-
create
knight
be
stand
,
in
a
pensive
attitude
,
beside
the
beautiful
fountain
,
adorn
with
two
fair
statue
,
represent
the
Queen
of
Love
and
her
son
,
heretofore
describe
as
place
in
the
centre
of
the
great
quadrangle
of
the
Palace
of
Theobalds
.
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
be
listen
to
the
plashing
of
the
sparkle
jet
of
water
,
as
they
rise
into
the
air
,
and
fall
back
into
the
broad
marble
basin
,
and
appear
to
be
soothe
by
the
pleasant
sound
.
<EOS>
His
breast
have
be
agitate
by
various
and
conflicting
emotion
.
<EOS>
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
event
have
occur
,
some
of
which
seem
likely
to
influence
the
whole
of
his
future
career
;
while
one
of
them
,
though
it
have
advance
him
far
beyond
what
he
could
have
anticipate
,
appear
likely
to
mar
altogether
his
prospect
of
happiness
.
<EOS>
though
the
difficulty
,
therefore
,
that
surround
him
have
be
unexpectedly
overcome
;
though
,
by
the
exertion
of
the
Conde
de
Gondomar
,
who
have
follow
up
his
first
success
with
wonderful
promptitude
and
perseverance
,
and
have
dexterously
contrive
,
by
all
the
insidious
art
of
which
lie
be
so
perfect
a
master
,
to
ingratiate
his
protegé
still
further
with
the
King
,
without
the
protegé
himself
be
aware
of
the
manner
in
which
he
be
serve
;
though
James
himself
appear
greatly
pleased
with
him
,
at
the
banquet
in
the
evening
,
to
which
,
owe
to
the
skilful
management
of
the
spanish
ambassador
,
he
be
invite
,
and
bestow
such
marked
attention
upon
him
,
that
the
envy
and
jealousy
of
most
of
the
courtier
be
excite
by
it
;
though
he
seem
on
the
high
-
road
to
still
great
favour
,
and
be
already
look
upon
as
a
rise
favourite
,
who
may
speedily
supplant
other
above
him
in
this
ever
-
change
sphere
,
if
he
do
not
receive
a
check
;
though
his
present
position
be
thus
comparatively
secure
,
and
his
prospect
thus
brilliant
,
he
feel
ill
at
ease
,
and
deeply
dissatisfied
with
himself
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
acquit
himself
of
blame
for
the
part
he
have
play
,
though
involuntarily
,
in
the
arrest
of
Hugh
Calveley
.
<EOS>
It
be
inexpressibly
painful
to
him
;
and
he
feel
it
as
a
reproach
from
which
he
could
not
free
himself
,
to
have
rise
,
however
unexpectedly
on
his
own
part
,
by
the
unfortunate
Puritan
's
fall
.
<EOS>
how
could
he
ever
face
Aveline
again
!
<EOS>
She
must
regard
him
with
horror
and
detestation
,
as
the
involuntary
cause
of
her
father
's
destruction
.
<EOS>
a
bar
have
be
place
between
them
,
which
nothing
could
ever
remove
.
<EOS>
and
though
,
on
the
one
hand
,
he
be
suddenly
exalt
far
beyond
his
hope
;
yet
on
the
other
he
be
as
suddenly
cast
down
,
and
threaten
to
be
for
ever
deprive
of
the
bliss
he
have
in
view
,
the
possession
of
which
he
covet
far
more
than
wealth
or
grandeur
.
<EOS>
additional
complexity
have
be
give
to
his
position
from
the
circumstance
that
,
at
De
Gondomar
's
secret
instance
,
of
which
,
like
all
the
rest
,
he
be
unaware
,
he
have
be
appoint
as
officer
in
custody
of
Hugh
Calveley
,
until
the
latter
,
who
be
still
detain
a
close
prisoner
in
the
porter
's
lodge
,
should
be
remove
to
the
Tower
,
or
the
Fleet
,
as
his
Majesty
may
direct
.
<EOS>
this
post
he
would
have
decline
,
have
there
be
a
possibility
of
do
so
.
<EOS>
any
plan
he
may
have
form
of
aid
the
prisoner
's
escape
be
thus
effectually
prevent
,
as
he
could
not
violate
his
duty
;
and
it
be
probably
with
this
view
that
the
wily
ambassador
have
obtain
him
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
he
have
unconsciously
become
little
more
than
a
puppet
in
the
hand
of
the
plot
Spaniard
,
who
pull
the
string
that
move
him
at
pleasure
,
regardless
of
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
what
De
Gondomar
's
ulterior
design
be
with
him
have
not
yet
become
manifest
.
<EOS>
these
perplex
thought
sweep
through
Sir
Jocelyn
's
breast
,
as
he
stand
by
the
marble
fountain
,
and
listen
to
the
sound
of
its
fall
water
.
<EOS>
while
thus
occupy
,
he
perceive
two
person
issue
from
the
arched
entrance
front
the
gate
(
adjoin
the
porter
's
lodge
,
in
which
the
prisoner
be
still
detain
)
,
and
make
their
way
slowly
across
the
quadrangle
,
in
the
direction
of
the
cloister
on
its
eastern
side
,
above
which
be
apartment
assign
to
the
Secretary
of
State
,
Sir
Thomas
Lake
.
<EOS>
the
foremost
of
the
two
be
merely
a
yeoman
of
the
guard
,
and
would
not
for
a
moment
have
attract
Sir
Jocelyn
's
attention
,
if
it
have
not
be
for
a
female
who
accompany
him
,
and
whom
he
be
evidently
conduct
to
Sir
Thomas
Lake
's
room
,
as
Sir
Jocelyn
not
only
see
the
man
point
towards
them
,
but
hear
him
mention
the
Secretary
of
State
's
name
.
<EOS>
something
whisper
him
that
this
closely
-
hooded
female,—the
low
part
of
whose
face
be
shroud
in
a
muffler
,
so
that
the
eye
alone
be
visible,—was
Aveline
.
<EOS>
little
could
be
discern
of
the
feature
;
but
the
exquisitely
-
proportion
figure
,
so
simply
yet
so
tastefully
arrayed
,
could
only
be
hers
;
and
if
he
could
have
doubt
that
it
be
Aveline
,
the
suddenness
with
which
her
look
be
avert
as
she
behold
him
,
and
the
quickness
with
which
she
step
forward
,
so
as
even
to
outstrip
her
companion
—
these
circumstance
,
couple
with
the
violent
throbbing
of
his
own
heart
,
convince
him
he
be
right
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
fly
after
her
,
if
he
have
dare
;
would
have
pour
forth
all
his
passionate
feeling
to
her
,
have
he
be
permit
;
would
have
offer
her
his
life
,
to
deal
with
as
she
please
;
but
his
fear
restrain
him
,
and
he
remain
rivet
to
the
spot
,
gaze
after
her
until
she
enter
the
great
hall
on
the
ground
floor
,
beneath
the
Secretary
of
State
's
apartment
.
<EOS>
why
she
seek
Sir
Thomas
Lake

could
easily
understand
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
from
him
that
authority
to
visit
her
father
could
be
obtain
.
<EOS>
after
remain
irresolute
for
a
few
minute
,
during
which
the
magnificent
structure
around
him
fade
entirely
from
his
view
like
a
vision

into
air
,
and
he
hear
no
more
the
pleasant
plashing
of
the
fountain

CHAPTER
XXV.Sir
Thomas
Lake
.
<EOS>
a
grave
-
looking
man
,
of
a
melancholy
and
severe
aspect
,
and
attire
in
a
loose
robe
of
black
velvet
,
be
seat
alone
in
a
chamber
,
the
window
of
which
open
upon
the
Fountain
Court
,
which
we
have
just
quit
.
<EOS>
He
wear
a
silken
skull
-
cap
,
from
beneath
which
a
few
gray
hair
escape
;
his
brow
be
furrow
with
innumerable
wrinkle
,
occasion
as
much
by
thought
and
care
as
by
age
;
his
pointed
beard
and
moustache
be
almost
white
,
contrast
strikingly
with
his
dark
,
jaundice
complexion
,
the
result
of
an
atrabilarious
temperament
;
his
person
be
extremely
attenuated
,
and
his
hand
thin
and
bony
.
<EOS>
He
have
once
be
tall
,
but
latterly
have
lose
much
of
his
height
,
in
consequence
of
a
curvature
of
the
spine
,
which
bow
down
his
head
almost
upon
his
breast
,
and
fix
it
immoveably
in
that
position
.
<EOS>
His
feature
be
good
,
but
,
as
we
have
state
,
be
stamp
with
melancholy
,
and
sharpen
by
severity
.
<EOS>
this
person
be
Sir
Thomas
Lake
,
Secretary
of
State
.
<EOS>
the
table
at
which
he
sit
be
strew
over
with
official
document
and
paper
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
,
however
,
examine
any
of
them
,
but
have
just
break
the
seal
of
a
private
packet
which
he
have
receive
from
his
wife
,
when
an
usher
enter
,
and
intimate
that
a
young
maiden
,
who
be
without
,
solicit
a
moment
's
audience
.
<EOS>
the
request
would
have
be
refuse
,
if
the
man
have
not
go
on
to
say
that
he
believe
the
applicant
be
the
daughter
of
the
crazy
Puritan
,
who
have
threaten
the
King
's
life
on
the
previous
day
.
<EOS>
on
hear
this
,
Sir
Thomas
consent
to
see
her
,
and
she
be
admit
accordingly
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
the
usher
have
retire
,
Aveline
unmuffle
herself
,
and
,
cold
and
apathetic
as
he
be
,
Sir
Thomas
could
not
help
be
strike
by
her
surpass
beauty
,
unimpaired
even
by
the
affliction
under
which
she
labour
;
and
he
consequently
soften
in
some
degree
the
customary
asperity
of
his
tone
in
address
her
.
"Who
<EOS>
be
you
,
maiden
,
and
what
seek
you
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
demand
,
eye
her
with
curiosity
.
<EOS>
"i
be
daughter
to
the
unfortunate
Hugh
Calveley
,
now
a
prisoner
in
the
palace
,
"
she
reply
.
<EOS>
"I
be
sorry
to
hear
it
<EOS>
,
"
rejoin
Sir
Thomas
,
resume
his
habitually
severe
expression
;
"
for
you
be
the
daughter
of
a
very
heinous
offender
.
<EOS>
the
enormity
of
Hugh
Calveley
's
crime
,
which
be
bad
than
parricide
,
deprive
him
of
all
human
sympathy
and
compassion
.
<EOS>
in
come
to
me
you
do
not
,
I
presume
,
intend
to
weary
me
with
prayer
for
mercy
;
for
none
be
deserve
,
and
none
will
be
show
.
<EOS>
for
my
own
part
,
I
shall
not
utter
a
word
in
mitigation
of
the
dreadful
sentence
certain
to
be
pronounce
upon
him
;
nor
shall
I
advise
the
slight
clemency
to
be
show
him
on
the
part
of
his
Majesty
.
<EOS>
such
an
offender
can
not
be
too
severely
punish
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
this
,
"
he
continue
,
somewhat
soften
his
harshness
,
"
to
aggravate
the
distress
and
shame
you
naturally
feel
;
but
I
wish
to
check
at
once
any
hope
you
may
have
form
.
<EOS>
yet
though
I
have
no
pity
for
him
,
I
have
much
for
you
,
since
,
doubtless
,
you
be
innocent
of
all
knowledge
of
your
father
's
atrocious
design
—
happily
prevent
.
<EOS>
and
I
would
therefore
say
to
you
,
shut
out
all
feeling
for
him
from
your
heart
.
<EOS>
the
man
who
raise
his
hand
against
his
sovereign
cut
off
by
the
act
all
tie
of
kindred
and
love
.
<EOS>
affection
be
change
to
abhorrence
;
and
such
detestation
do
his
horrible
offence
inspire
,
that
those
of
his
own
blood
be
bind
to
shun
him
,
lest
he
derive
comfort
and
consolation
from
their
presence
.
<EOS>
thus
consider
,
you
be
no
longer
his
daughter
,
for
he
have
himself
sever
the
link
between
you
.
<EOS>
You
no
longer
owe
him
filial
duty
and
regard
,
for
to
such
he
be
no
more
entitled
.
<EOS>
leave
him
to
his
fate
;
and
,
if
possible
,
for
ever
obliterate
his
memory
from
your
breast
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
counsel
what
I
can
never
perform
,
honourable
Sir
,
"
reply
aveline
;
"
and
be
he
even
brand
like
Cain
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
shut
my
heart
towards
him
.
<EOS>
nothing
can
make
me
forget
that
I
be
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
that
his
offence
will
be
dreadfully
expiate
,
I
do
not
doubt
;
but
if
I
can
alleviate
his
suffering
in
any
way
,
I
will
do
so
;
and
I
will
never
cease
to
plead
for
mercy
for
him
.
<EOS>
and
o
,
honourable
Sir
!
<EOS>
you
regard
his
offence
in
a
dark
light
than
it
deserve
.
<EOS>
You
treat
him
as
if
he
have
actually
accomplish
the
direful
purpose
attribute
to
him
;
whereas
,
nothing
have
be
prove
against
him
beyond
the
possession
of
a
weapon
,
which
he
may
keep
about
his
person
for
self
-
defence
.
<EOS>
""the
<EOS>
plea
you
urge
be
futile
,
maiden
,
"
rejoin
Sir
Thomas
;
"
he
be
judge
out
of
his
own
mouth
,
for
his
own
lip
have
avow
his
criminal
intention
.
<EOS>
""Still
,
it
be
but
<EOS>
the
intention
,
honourable
sir!""in
such
case
,
the
intention
be
equal
to
the
crime
—
at
least
in
the
eye
of
law
and
justice
.
<EOS>
no
plea
will
save
Hugh
Calveley
.
<EOS>
of
that
rest
assured
.
<EOS>
""one
<EOS>
plea
may
be
urge
for
him
,
which
,
whether
it
avail
or
not
,
be
the
truth
,
and
shall
be
make
.
<EOS>
It
be
painful
to
speak
of
my
father
as
I
must
now
do
;
but
there
be
no
help
for
it
.
<EOS>
of
late
year
he
have
be
subject
to
strange
mental
hallucination
,
which
have
border
close
upon
madness
,
if
they
have
not
reach
that
terrible
point
.
<EOS>
nocturnal
vigil
,
fasting
,
and
prayer
have
affect
his
health
.
<EOS>
He
have
deny
himself
sufficient
rest
,
and
have
only
partaken
of
food
barely
sufficient
to
sustain
nature
,
and
no
more
.
<EOS>
the
consequence
have
be
that
strange
fancy
have
trouble
his
brain
;
that
at
dead
of
night
,
when
alone
in
his
chamber
,
he
have
imagine
that
vision
have
appear
to
him
;
that
voice
have
speak
—
awful
voice
—
talk
of
prophecy
,
lamentation
,
and
judgment
,
and
charge
him
with
a
mighty
and
terrible
mission
.
<EOS>
all
these
thing
I
have
hear
from
his
own
lip
,
and
I
have
hear
and
see
much
more
,
which
have
satisfy
me
that
his
intellect
be
disorder
,
and
that
he
can
not
be
hold
accountable
for
his
action
.
<EOS>
""if
<EOS>
such
be
the
case
,
he
should
have
be
keep
under
restraint
,
and
not
suffer
to
go
abroad

say
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
"
such
madman

highly
mischievous
and
dangerous
.
<EOS>
much
blame

with
you

maiden

<EOS>
""The

"
I
confess
my

<EOS>
""There

Sir
Thomas
gravely
,
though
he
be
not
unmoved
by
her
filial
devotion

there
be
an
offender

there
will

dread
sentence

""O

!

<EOS>
My

eye

I
be
equally
culpable

part
from

yesterday!""let
<EOS>
me
hear
how
that
occur

maiden

ask
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
chance
in
this
way
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
describe
my
father
's
state
of
mind
,
and
the
distemper
view
he
have
be
accustom
to
take
of
all
thing
.
<EOS>
yesterday
,
May
-
day
sport
be
hold
in
the
village
of
Tottenham
,
where
we
dwelt
;
and
as
such
thing
be
an
abomination
in
his
sight
,
he
take
upon
him
to
reprove
the
actor
in
the
pastime
.
<EOS>
They
who
witness
his
conduct
on
that
occasion
would
hardly
hold
him
to
be
under
the
due
control
of
reason
.
<EOS>
amongst
the
spectator
be
the
son
of
an
old
friend
,
whose
name
have
accidentally
reach
my
father
,
he
invite
him
into
the
house
,
and
a
misunderstanding
have
arise
between
them
,
the
latter
suddenly
leave
—
dismiss
almost
with
rudeness
.
<EOS>
on
his
departure
,
my
father
be
greatly
disturb
—
more
so
than
I
have
ever
see
him
.
<EOS>
after
awhile
,
he
withdraw
to
his
own
chamber
,
as
be
his
habit
,
to
pray
,
and
I
hope
would
become
tranquillized
;
but
the
very
reverse
happen
,
for
when
he
reappear
<EOS>
,
I
see
at
once
that
a
fearful
change
have
take
place
in
him
.
<EOS>
His
eye
blaze
with
preternatural
light
,
his
gesture
be
wild
and
alarming
,
and
his
language
full
of
menace
and
denunciation
.
<EOS>
He
again
speak
of
his
mission
from
Heaven
,
and
say
that
its
execution
could
no
longer
be
delay
.
<EOS>
""this
should
have
be
a
warning
to
you
,
"
observe
Sir
Thomas
,
knit
his
brow
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
should
,
honourable
Sir

I
do
not
profit
by
it

<EOS>
I
know
and
feel
that
he
be
no
longer
under
the
dominion
of
reason
—
that
he
be
labour
under
some
terrible
delusion
that
approach
its
crisis
;
but
I
do
not
check
him
.
<EOS>
I
yield
passive
obedience
to
his
injunction
,
that
I
should
depart
instantly
with
an
old
servant
to
London
;
and
I
agree
to
tarry
at
a
house
,
which
he
mention
,
till
I
hear
from
him

<EOS>
I
have
sad
foreboding
that
I
should
never

from
him
again

if
I
do
,
that
the
tiding
would
be
bad
than
none

I

I
could
not

indeed

his
will

forth

attendant

father
part
with
us
at
the
door

<EOS>
He
place
money
in
my
hand

bade
me
farewell
!
<EOS>
but
in
such
a
tone
,
and
with
such
a
look
,
that
I
feel
his
sense
be
go
,
and
I
would
have
stay
him
,
but
it
be
then
too
late
.
<EOS>
break
from
my
embrace
,
he
spring
upon
his
horse
,
which
be
ready
saddle
,
and
ride
off
,
take
the
direction
of
Edmonton
;
while
I
,
with
a
heart
full
of
distress
and
misgiving
,
pursue
my
way
to
London
.
<EOS>
Ere
midnight
,
my
sad
presentiment
be

messenger

me
out
,

intelligence
of
the
direful
event
that
have
happen

inform
me
that
my
father

a
prisoner
at
Theobalds
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
I
could
procure
mean
of
reach
the
palace
,
I
set
forth
,
and
arrive
here
about
an
hour
ago
,
when
,
fail
in
my
effort
to
obtain
an
interview
with
my
father

who
be
closely
confine
,
and
none
suffer
to
come
near
him
save
with
authority
from
the
Secretary

I
seek
an
audience
of

honourable
Sir

permission
to
see
him

""if

reply
Sir
Thomas

<EOS>
"
with
this
restriction
,
I
be
willing
to
sign
an
order
for
you
.
<EOS>
""be
it
as
you
please

honourable
Sir

take
my
heartfelt
gratitude
for

"Sir

a
small
bell
upon
the
table

at
the
summon

bow
,

<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Lake
then
turn
to
the
paper
which
he
have
just
open
before
Aveline
's
appearance
,
and
be
soon
so
much
engross
by
it
that
he
seem
quite
unconscious
of
her
presence
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
become
gloomy
and
more
austere
as
he
read
on
,
and
an
expression
of
pain
—
almost
a
groan
—
escape
him
.
<EOS>
He
appear
then
to
feel
sensible
that
he
have
commit
an
indiscretion
,
for
he
lay
down
the
paper
,
and
,
as
if
forcibly
divert
himself
from
its
content
,
address
Aveline
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
you
have
say
respect
your
father
's
condition
of
mind
,
"
he
observe
,
"
by
no
means
convince
me
that
it
be
so
unsound
as
to
render
him
irresponsible
for
his
action
.
<EOS>
It
be
to
put
a
charitable
construction
upon
his
conduct
to
say
that
no
one
but
a
madman
could
be
capable
of
it
;
but
there
be
too
much
consistency
in
what
he
have
say
and
do
to
admit
of
such
an
inference
.
<EOS>
but
for
the
interposition
of
another
person
he
own
that
he
would
have
kill
the
King
;
and
the
disappointment
he
exhibit
,
and
the
language
he
use
,
prove
such
to
have
be
his
fix
intention
.
<EOS>
His
mind
may
have
be
disturb
;
but
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
all
who
meditate
great
crime
,
it
be
to
be
hope
,
be
not
entirely
master
of
themselves
.
<EOS>
yet
for
that
reason
they
be
not

He
who
be
sane
enough
to
conceive
an
act
of
wickedness
,
to
plan
its
execution
,
and
to
attempt
to
perpetrate
it
,
although
he
may
be
in
other
respect
of
unsettled
mind
,
be
equally
amenable
to
the
law
,
and
ought
equally
to
suffer
for
his
criminality
with
him
who
have
a
wise
and
sounder
head
upon
his
shoulder

<EOS>
"Aveline

eye

<EOS>
at
this
moment
the
door

open
by
the
usher

<EOS>
the

""The

Sir

approach
Aveline

who
could
scarcely
support
herself

with
the
intention
of
offer
her
assistance

forth

CHAPTER
<EOS>
XXVI.The
Forged
Confession
.
<EOS>
some
little
time
have
elapse
since
Aveline
's
departure
on
her
sorrowful
errand
,
and
Sir
Thomas
Lake
be
still
alone
,
and
once
more
deeply
engrossed
in
the
consideration
of
the
document
,
which
,
it
will
be
recollect
,
have
occasion
him
so
much
disquietude
;
and
the
feeling
by
no
means
diminish
when
the
usher
enter
and
announce
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
severe
and
inflexible
as
we
have
describe
him
,
the
Secretary
of
State
be
generally
yield
enough
towards
his
lady
,
of
whom
he
stand
in
great
awe
,
and
whom
he
treat
with
the
utmost
deference
;
but
on
this
occasion
,
contrary
to
habitude
,
he
receive
her
very
coldly
,
and
without
rise
motion
her
to
a
seat
beside
him
.
<EOS>
disregard
the
want
of
attention
,
which
,
under
other
circumstance
,
she
would
have
resent
,
Lady
Lake
take
the
seat
indicate
without
remark
,
and
continue
silent
till
the
usher
have
retire
.
<EOS>
then
turn
quickly
towards
her
husband
,
and
fix
an
inquire
look
upon
him
,
she
say
in
a
low
voice—"what
think
you
of
this
document
,
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas?""This
forgery
?
<EOS>
"
he
rejoin
in
the
same
tone
,
but
without
raise
his
eye
towards
her
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
this
forgery
,
if
you
choose
to
call
it
so
,
"
she
return
.
<EOS>
"
let
me
have
your
opinion
upon
it
?
<EOS>
be
it
as
it
should
be
?
<EOS>
be
its
expression
such
as
would
be
use
by
a
guilty
woman
,
like
the
Countess
,
imploring
pity
,
and
seek
to
shield
herself
from
disgrace
?
<EOS>
do
you
find
fault
with
it
?
<EOS>
Can
it
be
amend
in
any
particular?""I
find
such
grave
fault
with
it
,
"
reply
the
Secretary
of
State
,
still
without
look
up
,
"
that
I
would
amend
it
by
cast
it
into
the
flame
.
<EOS>
Lady
Lake
,
it
be
my
duty
to
warn
you
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
fearful
crime
you
would
commit
,
and
severely
punishable
by
the
law
.
<EOS>
You
may
excuse
it
to
yourself
,
because
you
have
an
end
in
view
which
seem
to
justify
the
mean
;
but
the
excuse
will
not
avail
you
with
other
.
<EOS>
You
have
say
that
in
a
conflict
with
one
so
cunning
and
unscrupulous
as
our
noble
son
-
in
-
law
,
you
be
compel
to
fight
him
with
his
own
weapon
—
to
meet
trick
with
trick
,
manoevre
with
manoeuvre
;
but
take
my
word
for
it
,
you
would
more
easily
defeat
him
by
straight
-
forward
mean
.
<EOS>
be
rule
by
me
in
this
one
instance
.
<EOS>
abandon
a
scheme
which
must
inevitably
lead
to
consequence
I
shudder
to
contemplate
;
and
let
this
fabricate
confession
be
destroy
.
<EOS>
""give
it
<EOS>
me
,
"
she
cry
,
snatch
the
paper
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
ever
timid
,
Sir
Thomas
;
and
if
you
have
not
lack
courage
,
this
expedient
would
not
have
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
odious
and
dangerous
as
it
be
,
the
measure
be
force
upon
me
,
and
I
shall
not
shrink
from
it
.
<EOS>
but
you
shall
not
be
call
upon
to
play
any
part
in
the
transaction
.
<EOS>
I
alone
will
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
alone
will
be
responsible
for
all
that
may
ensue
.
<EOS>
""we
shall
all
be
responsible
!
"
<EOS>
he
rejoin
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
only
ruin
yourself
,
but
all
your
family
,
if
this
fearful
step
be
take
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
we
have
have
right
on
our
side
,
but
henceforth
we
shall
be
more
culpable
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
""I
be
resolve
upon
the
course
,
"
cry
Lady
Lake
;
"
and
all
your
argument
—
all
your
warning
will
not
dissuade
me
from
it
,
<EOS>
so
you
may
spare
your
breath
,
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
as
you
see
,
I
have
omit
the
charge
of
witchcraft
,
and
have
only
make
the
Countess
confess
her
criminality
with
Lord
Roos
,
and
of
this
we
have
have
abundant
proof
;
<EOS>
nay
,
we
should
have
them
still
,
if
those
condemnatory
letter
of
her
,
which
have
come
into
our
possession
,
have
not
be
steal
.
<EOS>
that
mischance
necessitate
the
present
measure
.
<EOS>
have
manage
to
deprive
us
of
our
weapon
,
Lord
Roos
think
himself
secure
.
<EOS>
but
he
will
find
his
mistake
when
this
document
be
produce
to
confound
him
.
<EOS>
""i
tremble
at
the
thought
,
"
groan
the
Secretary
of
State
.
<EOS>
"these
<EOS>
fear
be
bad
than
womanish
,
"
exclaim
his
lady
.
"
<EOS>
shake
them
off
,
and
be
yourself
.
<EOS>
who
be
to
prove
that
the
confession
proceed
not
from
the
Countess
?
<EOS>
not
she
herself
;
since
no
one
will
believe
her
.
<EOS>
not
Lord
Roos
;
for
he
will
be
equally
discredit
.
<EOS>
not
Diego
;
for
his
testimony
would
be
valueless
.
<EOS>
the
Countess
's
hand
-
writing
have
be
so
skilfully
imitate
,
that
the
falsification
can
not
be
detect
.
<EOS>
compare
it
with
this
note
write
by
herself
to
Lady
Roos
,
and
which
,
though
it
prove
nothing
,
have
so
far
answer
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
compare
,
I
say
,
the
writing
of
the
confession
and
the
signature
with
this
note
,
and
declare
if
you
can
discern
any
difference
between
them
.
<EOS>
as
to
the
signature
of
Lord
Roos
and
Diego
affix
to
the
document
,
they
be
equally
well
simulated
.
<EOS>
""that
the
forgery
be
skilfully
execute
,
I
do
not
deny
,
"
reply
the
Secretary
of
State
;
"
and
that
circumstance
,
though
it
do
not
lessen
the
crime
,
may
lessen
the
chance
of
detection
.
<EOS>
since
nothing
I
can
urge
will
turn
you
from
your
design
,
and
you
be
determined
to
employ
this
dangerous
instrument
,
at
least
be
cautious
in
its
use
.
<EOS>
terrify
Lord
Roos
with
it
,
if
you
choose
.
<EOS>
threaten
to
lay
it
before
the
Earl
of
Exeter
—
before
the
King
himself
—
in
case
of
our
son
-
in
-
law
's
non
-
compliance
with
your
demand

<EOS>
but
beware
how
you
proceed
further
.
<EOS>
do
not
part
with
it
for
a
moment
;
so
that
,
if
need
be

you
may
destroy

you
heed

be
assure
I
will

with
due
caution.—i
be
glad

find

round
to
my
view

be
dispose
to
countenance
the
measure

<EOS>
""i
countenance
it
!
"
<EOS>
exclaim
the
Secretary
of
State
,
in
alarm
.
"
<EOS>
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
I
disapprove
of
it
entirely
,
and
can
not
sufficiently
reprehend
it
.
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
well
know
,
when
you
have
once
make
up
your
mind
,
the
fiend
himself
can
not
turn
you
from
your
purpose
,
I
give
you
the
good
counsel
I
can
under
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
I
wash
my
hand
of
it
altogether

<EOS>
Would
to
Heaven
I
have
never
be
consult
upon
it
—
never
even
be
make
acquainted
with
the
project
.
<EOS>
however
,
as
you
have
go
so
far
with
me
you
may
go
a
step
further
,
and
let
me
know
what
story
you
mean
to
attach
to
this
confession
?
<EOS>
how
will
you
feign
to
have
obtain
it?""the
statement
I
shall
make
will
be
this
,
and
it
will
be
bear
out
by
so
many
corroborative
circumstance
that
it
will
be
impossible
to
contradict
it
.
<EOS>
You
observe
that
the
document
be
date
on
the
10th
of
April
last
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
without
reason
that
it
be
so
dated
.
<EOS>
on
that
day
I
and
our
daughter
,
Lady
Roos
,
attend
by
her
maid
,
Sarah
Swarton
,
proceed
to
the
Earl
of
Exeter
's
residence
at
Wimbledon
,
for
the
purpose
of
have
an
interview
with
the
Countess
,
and
we
then
see
her
in
the
presence
of
Lord
Roos
and
his
servant
Diego
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
you
gain
nothing
by
the
journey
?

remark
her
husband

<EOS>
"your
pardon

Sir
Thomas

rejoin
;
"
I
gain
this
confession

<EOS>
on
the
way
back
I
reflect
upon
what
have
occur
,
and
I
think
how
flush
with
triumph
I
should
have
be
<EOS>
if
,
instead
of
meet
with
discomfiture
,
I
have
gain
my
point
—
if
I
have
bring
the
haughty
Countess
to
her
knee
—
have
compel
her
to
write
out
and
sign
a
full
avowal
of
her
guilt
,
couple
with
supplication
for
forgiveness
from
my
injure
daughter
and
myself
—
and
as
a
refinement
of
revenge
,
have
force
Lord
Roos
and
his
servant
to
attest
by
their
signature
the
truth
of
the
confession
!
<EOS>
I
think
of
this
—
and
incense
that
I
have
not
do
it
,
resolve
it
should
be
do
.
<EOS>
""An
ill
resolve
!

""Imprudent

place
yourself
wholly

Sir
Thomas

suppose
he
should
betray
the
terrible
trust
you
have
repose
in
him?""He

not

it

He
be
too
deeply
implicate
in
the
matter
not
to
keep
silence
for
his
own

to
proceed

document

such
as
you
see
it
,

draw
out
by
myself

transcribe
by
Luke

the
writing
so
admirably
counterfeit
that
Lady
Exeter
herself
may
well
doubt
if
it
be
not
her
own
.
<EOS>
then
,
as
to
the
circumstance
,
they
will
all
bear
me
out

<EOS>
We
be
know
to
have
be
at
Wimbledon
on
the
day
in
question

We

an
interview
with

the
interview
be
private

and
therefore
no
one
can
tell
what
take
place
at
it
;
but
the
probability
be
that
what
I
shall
assert
really
do
occur

"Sir
<EOS>

his
assent

go
on

the
consideration

CHAPTER
XXVIII.The
Secret
.
<EOS>
Thrice
be
the
guard
relieve
during
that
long
night
,
and
as
often
be
the
prisoner
visit
.
<EOS>
on
the
first
occasion
,
he
be
find
to
be
still
engage
with
his
Bible
,
and
he
so
continue
during
the
whole
time
the
man
remain
in
the
vault
.
<EOS>
the
next
who
come
discover
him
on
his
knee
,
pray
loudly
and
fervently
,
and
,
unwilling
to
disturb
him
,
leave
him
at
his
devotion
.
<EOS>
but
the
third
who
enter
be
strike
with
terror
at
the
prisoner
's
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
have
rise
from
the
ground
,
and
be
stand
as
erect
as
the
fetter
would
permit
,
with
his
hand
outstretche
,
and
his
eye
fix
on
vacancy
.
<EOS>
He
be
mutter
something
,
but
his
word
be
unintelligible
.
<EOS>
He
look
like
one
who
beheld
a
vision
;
and
this
impression
be
produce
upon
the
man
,
who
half
expect
some
awful
shape
to
reveal
itself
to
him
.
<EOS>
but
whatever
it
may
be
,
spirit
of
good
or
ill
,
it
be
visible
to
the
Puritan
alone
.
<EOS>
after
gaze
at
him
for
some
minute
,
in
mixed
wonderment
and
fright
,
the
halberdier
venture
to
draw
near
him
.
<EOS>
as
he
touch
him
,
the
Puritan
utter
a
fearful
cry
,
and
attempt
to
spring
forward
,
as
if
to
grasp
some
vanish
object
,
but
be
check
in
the
effort
by
the
chain
,
he
fall
heavily
to
the
ground
,
and
seem
to
sustain
severe
injury
;
for
when
the
man
raise
him
,
and
set
him
against
the
pillar
,
though
he
make
no
complaint
,
it
be
evident
he
suffer
excruciating
pain
.
<EOS>
the
halberdier
pour
out
a
cup
of
wine
,
and
offer
it
to
him
;
but
,
though
well
-
nigh
fainting
,
he
peremptorily
refuse
it
.
<EOS>
from
this
moment
a
marked
change
be
perceptible
in
his
look
.
<EOS>
the
hue
of
his
skin
become
cadaverous
;
his
eye
grow
dim
and
glassy
;
and
his
respiration
be
difficult
.
<EOS>
everything
betoken
that
his
suffering
would
be
speedily
over
,
and
that
,
however
he
may
deserve
it
,
Hugh
Calveley
would
be
spare
the
disgrace
of
death
by
the
hand
of
the
executioner
.
<EOS>
the
halberdier
be
not
unaware
of
his
condition
,
and
his
first
impulse
be
to
summon
assistance
;
but
he
be
deter
from
do
so
by
the
earnest
entreaty
of
the
Puritan
to
be
leave
alone
;
and
think
this
the
most
merciful
course
he
could
pursue
under
the
circumstance
,
he
yield
to
the
request
,
scarcely
expect
to
behold
him
alive
again
.
<EOS>
It
be
by
this
same
man
that
the
door
of
the
vault
be
open
to
Sir
Jocelyn
and
Aveline
.
<EOS>
the
shock
experience
by
the
maiden
at
the
sight
of
her
father
have
well
-
nigh
overcome
her
.
<EOS>
She
think
him
dead
,
and
such
be
Sir
Jocelyn
's
first
impression
.
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
Puritan
be
still
prop
against
the
pillar
,
as
the
halberdier
have
leave
him
,
but
his
head
have
fall
to
one
side
,
and
his
arm
hang
listlessly
down
.
<EOS>
with
a
pierce
shriek
his
daughter
fly
towards
him
,
and
kneel
beside
him
,
raise
his
head
gently
,
and
gaze
eagerly
into
his
face
,
perceive
that
he
still
live
,
though
the
spirit
seem
ready
to
wing
its
flight
from
its
fleshly
tabernacle
.
<EOS>
the
situation
be
one
to
call
forth
every
latent
energy
in
Aveline
's
character
.
<EOS>
control
her
emotion
,
she
utter
no
further
cry
,
but
set
herself
,
with
calmness
,
to
apply
such
restorative
as
be
at
hand
to
her
father
.
<EOS>
after
bathe
his
temple
and
chafe
his
hand
,
she
have
the
satisfaction
,
ere
long
,
of
see
him
open
his
eye
.
<EOS>
at
first
,
he
seem
to
have
a
difficulty
in
fix
his
gaze
upon
her
,
but
her
voice
reach
his
ear
,
and
the
feeble
pressure
of
his
hand
tell
that
he
know
her
.
<EOS>
the
power
of
speech
return
to
him
at
length
,
and
he
faintly
murmur
,
"
My
child
,
I
be
glad
to
see
you
once
more

<EOS>
I
think
all
be
over

have
please
Heaven
to

me
for
a
few
moment
to
give
you

a

it
would
have
divert
you
as
much
as
it
do
me

De

,
who
be
present
on
the
occasion

if
you
could
have

her
rage

mortification

when
she
discover

change

have

as
I

it

truly
laughable

<EOS>
the
good
lady
would
have
annihilate
me
if
she
could
;
and
threaten
me
with
terrible
reprisal
.
<EOS>
at
first
,
she
try
to
attribute
the
transformation
,
which
she
could
not
otherwise
account
for
,
to
witchcraft
;
and
though
I
deride
the
charge
<EOS>
,
I
must
needs
say
,
the
trick
be
so
cleverly
perform
,
that
it
do
look
like
magic
.
<EOS>
the
packet
contain
the
tress
of
hair
have
never
be
out
of
her
own
keeping
.
<EOS>
this
she
affirm
;
and
it
be
true
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
friendly
hand
to
open
it
nevertheless
;
to
purloin
its
priceless
treasure
;
and
to
substitute
something
of
a
similar
kind
,
though
of
comparatively
little
value
in
its
place
.
<EOS>
that
hand,—one
not
likely
to
be
suspect
,
be
no
other
than
that
of
my
lady
's
confidential
attendant
,
Sarah
Swarton
.
<EOS>
the
juggle
be
play
by
her
at
the
instance
of
Diego

<EOS>
anticipate
some
such
occurrence
as
the
present
,
and
desirous
of
have
a
spy
upon
the
movement
of
our
enemy
,
I
some
time
since
direct
Diego
to
pay
secret
court
to
Sarah
,
and
my
forethought
have
now
be
reward
.
<EOS>
the
main
difficulty
lie
with
poor
Gillian
.
<EOS>
She
be
greatly
embarrassed
by
her
situation
;
and
her
perplexity
be
increase
by
the
presence
of
a
jealous
lover
in
the
shape
of
an
apprentice
,
who
refuse
to
leave
her
till
his
doubt
should
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
this
be
awkward
,
as
the
story
could
not
be
very
well
reconcile
so
as
to
suit
all
party
.
<EOS>
accordingly
,
when
the
discovery
be
make
,
which
seem
to
proclaim
the
poor
girl
's
infidelity
,
the
youth
's
rage
and
consternation
be
nearly
equal
to
Lady
Lake
's
;
a
circumstance
that
add
considerable
zest
to
the
comedy
.
<EOS>
but
I
see
it
do
not
divert
you
so
much
as
I
expect
,
and
therefore
,
to
relieve
your
mind
,
I
may
tell
you
that
the
jealous
varlet
soon
repent
of
his
rash
determination
,
and
pursue
his
mistress
,
whom
do
Gondomar
have
considerately
take
under
his
protection
,
prevail
upon
her
to
give
the
amorous
ambassador
the
slip
,
and
return
with
him
to
her
father
's
abode
at
Tottenham
.
<EOS>
""I
be
right
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
say
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
"
though
I
have
see
so
little
of
Gillian
,
I
can
not
help
take
an
interest
in
her
;
she
be
so
pretty
,
and
so
innocent
in
appearance
,
and
her
manner
be
so
artless
and
engaging
.
<EOS>
I
owe
her
some
reparation
for
the
mischief
I
have
do
her
,
and
will
not
neglect
to
make
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
sorry
I
ever
be
induce
by
you
to
take
her
into
my
service
;
and
I
be
thankful
to
hear
she
have
escape
De
Gondomar
's
snare

""You

wonderfully
interested

hope
she
will
be
grateful

rejoin
Lord
Roos
,
with
a
laugh

<EOS>
"
but
I
should
not
be
surprised
if
De
Gondomar
still
gain
his
point
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
his
way
to
give
up
a
pursuit
he
have
once
undertake
.
<EOS>
however
,
to
leave
the
pretty
damsel
to
her
fate
,
which
will
depend
entirely
on
her
own
conduct
,
let
us
return
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
We
have
good
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
the
issue
of
this
adventure
of
the
lock
of
hair
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
that
recurrence
to
the
charge
of
witchcraft
on
the
part
of
my
vindictive
mother
-
in
-
law
show
the
extent
of
her
malice
,
and
I
can
not
doubt
that
in
threaten
me
with
reprisal
she
will
be
as
good
as
her
word
.
<EOS>
It
behove
us
,
therefore
,
to
be
beforehand
with
her
.
<EOS>
what
she
may
intend
I
can
not
say
,
but
I
be
satisfied
she
have
a
formidable
scheme
on
foot
,
and
that
nothing
but
her
husband
's
interposition
prevent
its
disclosure
when
she
be
so
violently
incensed
against
me
.
<EOS>
""You

fill
me
with
terror

exclaim
the
Countess

hostility

Lord
Roos
,
with
a
sudden
change

manner

lay
aside
the
levity

exhibit

it

should
require

Roos

the
next
step
take
by

Lake
will
be
fatal
to
us

must
be
no
delay

no
irresolution

can
not

in

will
comprehend
how
want
in
firmness
I
be

when
I
tell
you
what
happen
the
other
night

incredible
as
it
may
sound

wife

in
order
to
prove
her
devotion

to
free
me
from
further
annoyance

part

offer
to
take
poison

but
for
my
interference
(
fool
that
I
be

)
<EOS>
would
have
drain
the
phial
contain

deadly
potion

<EOS>
the
weakness
be
momentary

I
reproach
myself
for
it

too
late

it
convince
me
that
a
firm
hand
than
mine

be

in
the
task

<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
can
you

after

seriously
meditate

lay
down

life

more
incredible

more
monstrously
wicked

<EOS>
""Wicked

may
be

excuse

"And
<EOS>
without

for

he
stride
out
of
the

<EOS>
Lady
Exeter
would
have

"while
<EOS>
the
unhappy
lady
thus
unavailingly
deplore
the
sad
position
in
which
her
own
misconduct
have
place
her
,
and
from
which
she
feel
wholly
incapable
of
extricate
herself

while
in
this
wretched
frame

she
await
her

,
as
we
have
show

some

in

will
cast

round
the
chamber

she
sit

<EOS>
and
we
be
prompt
to
do
this

not
because
it

but
because
it
be
the
room

to
by
Lady

as
the
scene
of
the
confession
she
have
forge
.
<EOS>
the
apartment
,
then
,
be
spacious
and
handsomely
furnished
in
the
heavy
taste
of
the
period
,
with
but
little
to
distinguish
it
from
other
room
visit
by
us
in
the
course
of
this
story
.
<EOS>
like
most
of
them
,
it
have
a
gloomy
air
,
cause
by
the
dark
hue
of
its
oaken
panel
,
and
the
heavy
fold
of
its
antiquated
and
fade
tapestry
.
<EOS>
the
latter
be
chiefly
hang
against
the
low
end
of
the
chamber
,
and
serve
as
a
screen
to
one
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
at
the
opposite
end
,
there
be
a
wide
and
deep
bay
window
,
glow
with
stained
glass
,
amid
the
emblazonry
of
which
may
be
discern
the
proud
escutcheon
of
the
house
of
Exeter
,
with
the
two
lion
rampant
form
its
supporter
.
<EOS>
on
the
right
of
the
enormous
carve
mantel
-
piece
,
which
,
with
its
pillar
,
statue
,
'
scutcheon
,
and
massive
cornice
,
mount
to
the
very
ceiling
,
be
hang
a
portrait
of
the
Earl
of
Exeter
—
<EOS>
a
grave
,
dignified
personage
,
clothe
in
the
attire
of
Elizabeth
's
time
;
and
on
the
left
,
be
a
likeness
of
the
Countess
herself
,
paint
in
all
the
pride
of
her
unequalled
beauty
,
and
marvellous
in
resemblance
then
;
but
how
different
in
expression
from
her
feature
now!In
the
recess
of
the
window
stand
an
oak
table
,
cover
with
a
piece
of
rich
carpet
fringe
with
gold
,
on
which
a
massive
silver
inkstand
and
material
for

;
and
this
table
be
seize
upon
by

feature
in

plot
.
<EOS>
here
she
would
have
it
<EOS>
the
confession
be
sign
by
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
another
point
in
reference
to
this
scheme
must
not
be
pass
unnoticed
.
<EOS>
We
have
mention
the
heavy
hanging
at
the
low
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
accord
to
the
plotter
,
it
be
behind
these
that
Sarah
Swarton
—
the
intended
witness
of
the
imaginary
scene
—
be
conceal
.
<EOS>
the
principal
subject
represent
on
the
arra
be
the
Judgment
of
Solomon
,
and
the
Temptation
of
our
first
parent
in
the
Garden
by
the
Serpent
.
<EOS>
the
hanging
have
evidently
not
be
remove
for
year
,
and
do
not
reach
within
two
foot
of
the
ground
—
a
circumstance
that
have
escape
the
attention
of
Lady
Lake
—
prove
the
truth
of
her
husband
's
observation
,
that
in
the
best
contrived
plot
some
imperfection
will
exist
certain
to
operate
in
its
detection
.
<EOS>
to
return
to
the
unhappy
Countess
.
<EOS>
so
lose
be
she
in
reflection
,
that
she
do
not
remark
Lord
Roos
's
return
till
make
aware
of
it
by
a
slight
touch
on
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
when
she
raise
her
eye
,
they
fall
upon
an
object
that
inspire
her
with
the
dread
and
aversion
that
a
noxious
reptile
may
have
produce
.
<EOS>
She
have
never
see
Luke
Hatton
before
;
and
if
she
have
figure
him
to
her
mind
at
all
,
it
be
not
as
anything
agreeable
;
but
she
be
not
prepare
for
so
hideous
and
revolt
a
personage
as
he
appear
to
be
.
<EOS>
His
face
be
like
an
ugly
mask
,
on
which
a
sardonic
grin
be
stamp
.
<EOS>
His
feature
be
large
and
gaunt
,
and
he
have
the
long
,
hooked
nose
,
and
the
sharp
-
point
bestial
ear
of
a
satyr
,
with
leer
eye
—
betoken
at
once
sensuality
and
cunning
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
chin
and
beard
of
a
goat
,
and
crisply
-
curl
hair
of
a
pale
yellow
colour
.
<EOS>
with
all
this
,
there
be
something
sordid
in
his
look
as
well
as
his
attire
,
which
show
that
to
his
other
vice
he
add
that
of
avarice
.
<EOS>
a
mock
humility
,
belie
by
the
changeless
sneer
upon
his
countenance
,
distinguish
his
deportment
.
<EOS>
It
could
be
see
at
once
that
,
however
cringe
he
may
be
,
he
despise
the
person
he
address
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
in
spite
of
all
his
effort
to
control
it
,
there
be
something
sarcastic
in
his
speech
.
<EOS>
His
doublet
and
hose
,
both
of
which
have
endure
some
service
,
and
be
well
-
nigh
threadbare
,
be
tawny
-
colour
;
and
he
wear
a
short
yellow
cloak
,
a
great
ruff
of
the
same
colour
,
and
carry
a
brown
steeple
-
crown
hat
in
his
hand
.

him

as
to
his
trustworthiness

I
have
the
good
reason
for

because
I
hold

whenever

defeat
she
have
sustain
from
Lord
Roos
,
but
for
her
husband
's
determined
opposition
.
<EOS>
this
may
appear
surprising
in
a
man
so
completely
under
his
wife
's
governance
as
be
Sir
Thomas
;
but
the
more
he
reflect
upon
the
possible
consequence
of
the
scheme
,
the
more
averse
to
it
he
become
;
and
find
all
argument
unavaile
to
dissuade
his
lady
from
her
purpose
,
he
at
last
summon
up
resolution
enough
positively
to
interdict
it

<EOS>
but
the
project
be
only
defer
,
and
not
abandon

<EOS>
the
forge
confession
be
keep
in
readiness
by
Lady
Lake
for
production
on
the
first
favourable
opportunity

<EOS>
not
less
disinclined
to
the
measure
than
her
father
be
Lady
Roos
,
though
the
contrary
have
be
represent
to
Sir
Thomas
by
his
lady
;
but
accustomed
to
yield
blind
obedience
to
her
mother
's
wish
,
she
have
be
easily
work
upon
to
acquiesce
in
the
scheme
,
especially
as
the
fabricate
confession
do
not
appear
to
hurt
her
husband
,
<EOS>
for
whom
(
though
she
do
not
dare
to
exhibit
it
)
<EOS>
she
maintain
a
deep
and
unchanging
affection

<EOS>
so
utterly
heart

break
be
she
by
the
prolonged
and
painful
struggle
she
have
undergo
,
that
she
be
now
almost
indifferent
to
its
issue
.
<EOS>
for
some
time
her
health
have
give
way
under
the
severe
shock
she
have
endure
;
but
all
at
once
more
dangerous
symptom
begin
to
manifest
themselves
,
and
she
become
so
greatly
indisposed
that
she
could
not
leave
her
room
.
<EOS>
extremely
distress
in
its
effect
,
the
attack
resemble
fever
.
<EOS>
inextinguishable
thirst
torment
her
;
burn
pain
;
throb
in
the
temple
;
and
violent
fluttering
of
the
heart
.
<EOS>
no
alleviation
of
her
suffering
could
be
obtain
from
the
remedy
administer
by
Luke
Hatton
,
who
be
in
constant
attendance
upon
her
;
nor
will
this
be
wonder
at
,
since
we
be
in
the
secret
of
his
dark
doing
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
the
fever
increase
in
intensity
;
and
at
the
end
of
four
day
of
unremitting
agony,—witnesse
with
cynical
indifference
by
the
causer
of
the
mischief,—it
<EOS>
be
evident
that
her
case
be
desperate
.
<EOS>
from
the
first
Lady
Lake
have
be
greatly
alarm
,
for
with
all
her
fault
she
be
an
affectionate
mother
,
though
she
have
a
strange
way
of
show
her
affection
;
and
she
be
unremitte
in
her
attention
to
the
sufferer
,
scarcely
ever
quit
her
bedside
.
<EOS>
after
a
few
day
,
however
,
thus
spend
in
nurse
her
daughter
,
she
herself
succumb
to
a
like
malady
.
<EOS>
the
same
devour
internal
fire
scorch
her
up
,
and
rage
within
her
vein
;
the
same
unappeasable
thirst
torment
her
;
and
unable
longer
to
fulfil
her
task
,
she
confide
it
to
Sarah
Swarton
,
and
withdraw
to
another
chamber
,
communicate
by
a
side
door
,
mask
by
drapery
,
with
that
of
Lady
Roos
.
<EOS>
devoted
to
her
mistress
,
Sarah
Swarton
would
have
sacrifice
her
life
to
restore
her
to
health
;
and
she
care
not
though
the
fever
may
be
infectious
.
<EOS>
the
gentleness
and
resignation
of
the
ill
-
fate
lady
,
which
fail
to
move
Luke
Hatton
,
melt
her
to
tear
;
and
it
be
with
infinite
grief
that
she
see
her
,
day
by
day
,
sink
slowly
but
surely
into
the
grave
.
<EOS>
to
Lady
Roos
,
the
presence
of
Sarah
Swarton
be
an
inexpressible
comfort
.
<EOS>
the
handmaiden
be
far
superior
to
her
station
,
with
a
pleasing
countenance
,
and
prepossess
manner
,
and
possess
of
the
soft
voice
so
soothe
to
the
ear
of
pain
.
<EOS>
but
the
chief
comfort
derive
by
Lady
Roos
from
the
society
of
Sarah
Swarton
,
be
the
power
of
unbosom
herself
to
her
respect
her
husband
,
and
of
pour
her
sorrow
into
a
sympathise
ear
.
<EOS>
Lord
Roos
have
never
be
near
his
wife
since
her
seizure
—
nor
,
that
she
could
learn
,
have
make
any
inquiry
about
her
;
but
notwithstanding
his
heartless
conduct
,
her
great
desire
be
to
behold
him
once
more
before
she
die
,
and
to
breathe
some
last
word
into
his
ear
;
and
she
urge
the
wish
so
strongly
upon
her
confidante
,
that
the
latter
promise
,
if
possible
,
to
procure
its
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
a
week
have
now
nearly
elapse
—
the
fatal
term
appoint
by
Luke
Hatton
—
and
it
could
be
no
longer
doubt
that
,
if
the
last
gratification
seek
by
Lady
Roos
be
to
be
afford
her
,
it
must
not
be
delay
.
<EOS>
the
poor
sufferer
be
waste
to
a
skeleton
;
her
cheek
hollow
;
eye
sink
in
deep
cavity
,
though
the
orb
be
unnaturally
bright
;
and
her
frame
so
debilitate
,
that
she
could
scarcely
raise
herself
from
the
pillow
.
<EOS>
Sarah
Swarton
accordingly
resolve
to
set
out
upon
her
errand
;
but
before
do
so
,
she
seek
an
interview
with
Lady
Lake
,
for
the
purpose
of
reveal
certain
fearful
suspicion
she
have
begin
to
entertain
of
Luke
Hatton
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
do
this
before
,
but
there
be
almost
insuperable
difficulty
in
obtain
a
few
word
in
private
of
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
the
apothecary
be
continually
pass
from
room
to
room
,
hover
nigh
the
couch
of
his
patient
,
as
if
afraid
of
leave
them
for
a
moment
,
and
he
seem
to
regard
Sarah
herself
with
distrust
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
now
go
forth
,
and
she
resolve
to
take
advantage
of
his
absence
to
make
her
communication

bitterly
do
she
now
upbraid
herself

<EOS>
more
than
once
she
consult
Luke
Hatton
as
he
stand
beside
her
couch
,
with
the
habitual
sneer
upon
his
lip
,
watch
the
progress
of
his
own
infernal
work
,
as
to
the
possibility
of
renovate
her
strength
,
if
only
for
an
hour
,
in
order
that
she
may
strike
the
blow
.
<EOS>
but
he
shake
his
head
,
and
bade
her
wait
.
<EOS>
wait
,
however
,
she
would
not
,
and
she
become
at
length
so
impatient
,
that
he
agree
to
make
the
experiment
,
tell
her
he
would
prepare
a
draught
which
should
stimulate
her
into
new
life
for
a
short
time
,
but
he
would
not
answer
for
the
after
consequence

She

Luke

by

"
It
be
a
dreadful
and
infectious
fever
which
I
have
take
from
my

that
be
the
reason
why
Sir

Would

It

I

him
pour
a
few
drop
from
a
phial
into
the
drink
he
prepare
for
your

my
Lady

my
suspicion

arouse
by
his
manner
as
much
as
by
the
circumstance
,
I
watch
him
narrowly
,
and
find
that
this
proceeding
be
repeat
with
every
draught
;
with
this
difference
merely
,
that
the
dose
be
increase
in
strength
by
one
additional
drop
;
the
potion
administer
to
your
ladyship
be
some
degree
less
powerful
than
that
give
to
my
dear

no
doubt
be
intend
to
be
slow
in
its
effect

<EOS>
that
it
be
poison
,
I
be
certain
,
since
I
have
test
it
upon
myself
,
by
sip
a
small
quantity
of
the
liquid
;
and
I
have
reason
to
repent
my
rashness
,
for
I
soon
perceive
I
have
the
same
symptom
of
illness
as
those
which
distress
your
ladyship

""Why
<EOS>

you

It

ill

indeed
I

scarcely
well

,
to

I

It

that
can

your

would
incur
great
risk
in

I
mean
that
the
reaction
from
so
powerful
a

would
be
highly
dangerous

now
fully

poison

"CHAPTER
<EOS>
V.A
visit
to
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
's
Habitation
Near
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
allow
an
interval
of
three
or
four
month
to
elapse
between
the
event
last
record
,
and
those
about
to
be
narrate
,
we
shall
now
conduct
the
reader
to
a
large
,
gloomy
habitation
near
Fleet
Bridge
.
<EOS>
at
first
view
,
this
structure
,
with
its
stone
wall
,
corner
turret
,
ponderous
door
,
and
bar
window
,
may
be
take
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
ancient
prison
exist
in
this
locality
.
<EOS>
such
,
however
,
be
not
the
fact
.
<EOS>
the
little
river
Fleet
,
whose
muddy
current
be
at
that
time
open
to
view
,
flow
between
the
two
building
;
and
the
grim
and
frown
mansion
we
propose
to
describe
stand
on
the
western
bank
,
exactly
opposite
the
gateway
of
the
prison
.
<EOS>
now
,
as
no
one
have
a
strong
interest
in
the
Fleet
Prison
than
the
owner
of
that
gloomy
house
,
inasmuch
as
he
have
lodge
more
person
within
it
than
any
one
ever
do
before
him
,
it
would
almost
seem
that
he
have
select
his
abode
for
the
purpose
of
watch
over
the
safe
custody
of
the
numerous
victim
of
his
rapacity
and
tyranny
.
<EOS>
this
be
the
general
surmise
;
and
,
it
must
be
own
,
there
be
ample
warranty
for
it
in
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
a
loop
-
hole
in
the
turret
at
the
north
-
east
angle
of
the
house
command
the
court
of
the
prison
,
and
here
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
would
frequently
station
himself
to
note
what
be
go
forward
within
the
jail
,
and
examine
the
look
and
deportment
of
those
keep
by
him
in
durance
.
<EOS>
many
a
glance
of
hatred
and
defiance
be
throw
from
these
sombre
court
at
the
narrow
aperture
at
which
he
be
know
to
place
himself
;
but
such
regard
only
excited
Sir
Giles
's
derision
:
<EOS>
many
an
imploring
gesture
be
make
to
him
;
but
these
entreaty
for
compassion
be
equally
disregard
.
<EOS>
be
a
particular
friend
of
the
Warden
of
the
Fleet
,
and
the
jailer
obey
him
as
they
would
have
do
their
principal
,
he
enter
the
prison
when
he
please
,
and
visit
any
ward
he
choose
,
at
any
hour
of
day
or
night
;
and
though
the
unfortunate
prisoner
complain
of
the
annoyance,—and
especially
those
to
whom
his
presence
be
obnoxious,—no
redress
could
be
obtain
.
<EOS>
He
always
appear
when
least
expect
,
and
seem
to
take
a
malicious
pleasure
in
trouble
those
most
anxious
to
avoid
him
.
<EOS>
nor
be
Sir
Giles
the
only
visitant
to
the
prison
.
<EOS>
Clement
Lanyere
be
as
frequently
to
be
see
within
its
court
and
ward
as
his
master
,
and
a
similar
understanding
appear
to
exist
between
him
and
the
jailer
.
<EOS>
hence
,
he
be
nearly
as
much
an
object
of
dread
and
dislike
as
Sir
Giles
himself
,
and
few
see
the
mask
and
shrouded
figure
of
the
spy
approach
them
without
misgive
.
<EOS>
from
the
strange
and
unwarrantable
influence
exercise
by
Sir
Giles
and
the
promoter
in
the
prison
,
they
come
at
length
to
be
consider
as
part
of
it
;
and
matter
be
as
frequently
refer
to
them
by
the
subordinate
officer
as
to
the
warden
.
<EOS>
It
be
even
suppose
by
some
of
the
prisoner
that
a
secret
means
of
communication
must
exist
between
Sir
Giles
's
habitation
and
the
jail
;
but
as
both
he
and
Lanyere
possess
key
of
the
wicket
,
such
a
contrivance
be
obviously
unnecessary
,
and
would
have
be
dangerous
,
as
it
must
have
be
find
out
at
some
time
by
those
interest
in
the
discovery
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
show
,
however
,
that
,
in
one
way
or
other
,
Sir
Giles
have
nearly
as
much
to
do
with
the
management
of
the
Fleet
Prison
as
those
to
whom
its
governance
be
ostensibly
commit
,
and
that
he
could
,
if
he
think
proper
,
aggravate
the
suffering
of
its
unfortunate
occupant
without
incur
any
responsibility
for
his
treatment
of
them
.
<EOS>
He
look
upon
the
Star
-
Chamber
and
the
Fleet
as
the
mean
by
which
he
could
plunder
society
and
stifle
the
cry
of
the
oppress
;
and
it
be
his
business
to
see
that
both
machine
be
keep
in
good
order
,
and
work
well
.
<EOS>
but
to
return
to
his
habitation
.
<EOS>
Its
internal
appearance
correspond
with
its
forbid
exterior
.
<EOS>
the
apartment
be
large
,
but
cold
and
comfortless
,
and
,
with
two
or
three
exception
,
scantily
furnish
.
<EOS>
sumptuously
decorate
,
these
exceptional
room
present
a
striking
contrast
to
the
rest
of
the
house
;
but
they
be
never
open
,
except
on
the
occasion
of
some
grand
entertainment
—
a
circumstance
of
rare
occurrence
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
large
hall
of
entrance
,
where
Sir
Giles
's
myrmidon
be
will
not
to
assemble
,
with
a
great
table
in
the
midst
of
it
,
on
which
no
victual
be
ever
place
—
at
least
at
the
extortioner
's
expense
—
and
a
great
fire
-
place
,
where
no
fire
ever
burn
.
<EOS>
from
this
a
broad
stone
staircase
mount
to
the
upper
part
of
the
house
,
and
communicate
by
mean
of
dusky
corridor
and
narrow
passage
with
the
various
apartment
.
<EOS>
a
turnpike
staircase
connect
the
turret
to
which
Sir
Giles
use
to
resort
to
reconnoitre
the
Fleet
Prison
,
with
the
low
part
of
the
habitation
,
and
similar
corkscrew
stair
exist
in
the
other
angle
of
the
structure
.
<EOS>
when
station
at
the
loophole
,
little
recked
Sir
Giles
of
the
mighty
cathedral
that
frown
upon
him
like
the
offend
eye
of
heaven
.
<EOS>
His
gaze
be
seldom
raise
towards
Saint
Paul
's
,
or
if
it
be
,
he
have
no
perception
of
the
beauty
or
majesty
of
the
ancient
cathedral
.
<EOS>
the
object
of
interest
be
immediately
below
him
.
<EOS>
the
stern
reality
of
life
be
what
he
deal
with
.
<EOS>
He
have
no
taste
for
the
sublime
or
the
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
have
just
pay
an
inquisitorial
visit
,
such
as
we
have
describe
,
to
the
prison
,
and
be
return
homeward
over
Fleet
Bridge
,
when
he
encounter
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
,
who
be
come
in
quest
of
him
,
and
they
proceed
to
his
habitation
together
.
<EOS>
nothing
beyond
a
slight
greeting
pass
between
them
in
the
street
,
for
Sir
Giles
be
ever
jealous
of
his
slight
word
be
overhear
;
but
he
could
see
from
his
partner
's
manner
that
something
have
occur
to
annoy
and
irritate
him
greatly
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
be
in
no
respect
change
since
the
reader
last
beheld
him
.
<EOS>
habit
in
the
same
suit
of
sable
,
he
still
wear
the
same
mantle
,
and
the
same
plume
hat
,
and
have
the
same
long
rapier
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
His
deportment
,
too
,
be
as
commanding
as
before
,
and
his
aspect
as
stern
and
menacing
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
,
however
,
have
not
escape
the
consequence
naturally
to
be
expect
from
the
punishment
inflict
upon
him
by
the
apprentice
,
be
so
rheumatic
that
he
could
scarcely
walk
,
while
a
violent
cough
,
with
which
he
be
occasionally
seize
,
and
which
take
its
date
from
the
disastrous
day
refer
to
,
and
have
never
leave
him
since
,
threaten
to
shake
his
feeble
frame
in
piece
;
this
,
add
to
the
exasperation
under
which
he
be
evidently
labour
,
be
almost
too
much
for
him
.
<EOS>
three
month
seem
to
have
place
as
many
year
upon
his
head
;
or
,
at
all
event
,
to
have
take
a
vast
deal
out
of
his
constitution
.
<EOS>
but
,
notwithstanding
his
increase
infirmity
,
and
utter
unfitness
for
the
part
he
attempt
to
play
,
he
still
affect
a
youthful
air
,
and
still
ape
all
the
extravagance
and
absurdity
in
dress
and
manner
of
the
gay
and
young
court
coxcomb
.
<EOS>
He
be
still
attire
in
silk
and
satin
of
the
gaudy
hue
,
still
carefully
trim
as
to
hair
and
beard
,
still
redolent
of
perfume
.
<EOS>
not
without
exhibit
considerable
impatience
,
Sir
Giles
be
oblige
to
regulate
his
pace
by
the
slow
and
totter
step
of
his
companion
,
and
be
more
than
once
bring
to
a
halt
as
the
lung
of
the
latter
be
convulsively
tear
by
his
cough
,
but
at
last
they
reach
the
house
,
and
enter
the
great
hall
,
where
the
myrmidon
be
assemble
—
all
of
whom
rise
on
their
appearance
,
and
salute
them
.
<EOS>
there
be
Captain
Bludder
,
with
his
braggart
air
,
attend
by
some
half
-
dozen
alsatian
bully
;
Lupo
Vulp
,
with
his
crafty
look
;
and
the
tipstave
—
all
,
in
short
,
be
present
,
except
Clement
Lanyere
,
and
Sir
Giles
know
how
to
account
for
his
absence
.
<EOS>
to
the
inquiry
of
Captain
Bludder
and
his
associate
,
whether
they
be
likely
to
be
require
on
any
business
that
day
,
Sir
Giles
give

before
I
quit
the
subject

I
may
remark
,
that
one
thing
perplex
me
in
the
sudden
rise
of
this
upstart
,
and
that
be
that
he
encounter
no
opposition
from
Buckingham

<EOS>
even
the
King

I
be
tell
,
have
express
his
surprise
that
the
jealous
Marquis
should
view
one
who
may
turn
out
a
rival
with
so
much
apparent
complacency

<EOS>
""It
be
because
Buckingham
have
no
fear
of
him

Sir

<EOS>
He
know
he
have
but
to
say
the
word

the
puppet
bring
forward
by
De
Gondomar
—
for
it
be
by
him
that
Mounchensey
be
support
—
will
be
instantly
remove
;
but
as
he
also
know
,
that
another
would
be
set
up
,
he
be
content
to
let
him
occupy
the
place
for
a
time

<EOS>
""Certes
,
if
Mounchensey
have
more
knowledge
of
the
world
he
would
distrust
him
,
"
say
Sir
Francis

"
because
in
my
opinion
Buckingham
overact
his
part
,
and
show
him
too
much
attention
.
<EOS>
He
invite
him
,
as
I
be
give
to

to
all
his
masque
,
banquet
,

revel
at
York
House
,

even
condescend
to
flatter
him

<EOS>
such
conduct
would
awaken
suspicion
in
any
one
save
the
object
of
it

<EOS>
""I

have
tell
you
Buckingham

his

you

It

youth

<EOS>

a
banquet

at
Whitehall

by
all
the
principal
lord
and
lady
of
the
court
,
a
wager

between
the
Conde
de
Gondomar
and
the
Marquis
of
Buckingham
,
the
decision
of
which
be
refer
to
the
King
.
<EOS>
the
circumstance
occur
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
the
discourse
happen
to
turn
upon
joust
,
and
the
magnificent
favourite
,
who
be
hold
unrivalled
in
all
martial
exercise
and
chivalrous
sport
,
and
who
,
confident
in
his
own
skill
,
vauntingly
declare
that
he
have
never
meet
his
match
in
the
tilt
-
yard
;
whereupon
the
Spanish
Ambassador
,
willing
to
lower
his
pride
,
immediately
rejoin
,
that
he
could
,
upon
the
instant
,
produce
a
well
man
-
at
-
arm
than
he
;
and
so
certain
be
he
of
be
able
to
make
good
his
word
,
that
he
be
willing
to
stake
a
thousand
doubloon
to
a
hundred
on
the
issue
of
a
trial
.
<EOS>
to
this
Buckingham
haughtily
reply
,
that
he
at
once
accept
the
Ambassador
's
challenge
;
but
in
regard
to
the
term
of
the
wager
,
they
must
be
somewhat
modify
,
as
he
could
not
accept
them
as
propose
;
but
he
be
willing
to
hazard
on
the
result
of
the
encounter
all
the
gem
,
with
which
at
the
moment
his
habiliment
be
cover
,
against
the
single
diamond
clasp
wear
by
De
Gondomar
;
and
if
the
offer
suit
his
Excellency
,
he
have
nothing
to
do
but
appoint
the
day
,
and
bring
forward
the
man
.
<EOS>
De
Gondomar
reply
,
that
nothing
could
please
him
better
than
the
Marquis
's
modification
of
the
wager
,
and
the
proposal
be
quite
consistent
with
the
acknowledge
magnificence
of
his
lordship
's
notion
;
yet
he
beg
to
make
one
further
alteration
,
which
be
,
that
in
the
event
of
the
knight
he
should
nominate
be
adjudge
by
his
Majesty
to
be
the
good
jouster
,
the
rich
prize
may
be
deliver
to
him
.
<EOS>
Buckingham
assent
,
and
the
term
of
the
wager
be
now
fully
settle
,
it
only
remain
to
fix
the
day
for
the
trial
,
and
this
be
refer
to
the
King
,
who
appoint
the
follow
Thursday
—
thus
allow
,
as
the
banquet
take
place
on
a
Friday
,
nearly
a
week
for
preparation
.
<EOS>
James
,
also
,
good
-
naturedly
comply
with
the
Ambassador
's
request
,
and
agree
to
act
as
judge
on
the
occasion
;
and
he
laughingly
remark
to
Buckingham—"Ye

demente

Steenie
,
to

a
'
those
precious
stane
with
which
ye
be
bedeck
on
the
skill
with
which
ye
can
yield
a
frail
lance

<EOS>
We
may
say
unto
you
now
in
the
word
of
the
poet—'pendebant
ter

<EOS>
wha
shall
say
frae
whose

I
shall
win

his
Excellency

<EOS>
form
this
resolution

Buckingham

his
gaiety

press
the

to
give
importance
to
the

<EOS>
the
request

readily
grant
by
the
monarch
,
who
appear
to
take
a
strong
interest
in
the
match
than
Buckingham
altogether
like

confirm
him
in
his
determination

rid
himself
for
ever

obstacle

party

party

Prince
Charles

the
disposition
be

flattering

his
adversary

be
altogether
agreeable
to

haughty
favourite
,
he
could
not
raise
any
reasonable
objection

it

be
therefore

submit
with
the
good
grace
he
could

<EOS>
the
two
party
be

distribute
in

order

<EOS>
the
side

besides
Buckingham

be
the
Earls

to
the
seventh

Sir
Giles
Mompesson

by
the
Marquis

and
James

last

as

to
some
more
exalted

<EOS>
support
by
the
influence
of
De
Gondomar
,
and
uphold
by
his
own
personal
merit
,
which
by
this
time
,
in
spite
of
all
hostility
towards
him
,
have
begin
to
be
appreciate
;
with
the
King
himself
most
favourably
inclined
towards
him
,
and
Prince
Charles
amicably
dispose
;
with
many
of
the
courtier
proffer
him
service
,
who
be
anxious
to
throw
off
their
force
allegiance
to
the
overweening
favourite
,
and
substitute
another
in
his
stead
:
with
all
these
advantage
,
it
be
not
to
be
wonder
at
,
that
in
a
short
space
of
time
he
should
have
establish
a
firm
foot
on
that
smooth
and
treacherous
surface
,
the
pavement
of
a
palace
,
and
have
already
become
an
object
of
envy
and
jealousy
to
many
,
and
of
admiration
to
a
few
.
<EOS>
possess
the
faculty
of
adapt
himself
to
circumstance
,
Sir
Jocelyn
conduct
himself
with
rare
discretion
;
and
while
avoid
give
offence
,
never
suffer
a
liberty
to
be
take
with
himself
;
and
have
on
the
onset
establish
a
character
for
courage
,
he
be
little
afterwards
molest
.
<EOS>
It
be
creditable
to
him
,
that
in
a
court
where
morality
be
at
so
low
an
ebb
as
that
of
James
I.
,
he
should
have
remain
uncorrupted
;
and
that
not
all
the
allurement
of
the
numerous
beauty
by
whom
he
be
surround
,
and
who
exert
their
blandishment
to
ensnare
him
,
could
tempt
him
for
a
moment
's
disloyalty
to
the
object
of
his
affection
.
<EOS>
It
be
creditable
,
that
at
the
frequent
orgy
he
be
compel
to
attend
,
where
sobriety
be
deride
,
and
revelry
push
to
its
furth
limit
,
he
be
never
on
any
occasion
carry
beyond
the
bound
of
discretion
.
<EOS>
It
be
still
more
creditable
to
him
,
that
in
such
venal
and
corrupt
day
he
maintain
his
integrity
perfectly
unsullied
.
<EOS>
thus
severely
test
,
the
true
worth
of
his
character
be
prove
,
and
he
come
from
the
ordeal
without
a
blemish
.
<EOS>
the
many
excellent
quality
that
distinguish
the
newly

make
knight
and

of
the
bed

,
combine
with
his
remarkable
personal
advantage
and

manner

by
the
polish
he
have
recently
acquire
,
draw
,
as
we
have
intimate
,
the
attention
of
the
second
personage
in
the
kingdom
towards
him
.
<EOS>
strike
by
his
manner
,
and
by
the
sentiment
he
express
,
Prince
Charles
take
frequent
opportunity
of
converse
with
him
,
and
may
have
conceive
a
regard
for
him
but
for
the
jealous
interference
of
Buckingham
,
who
,
unable
to
brook
a
rival
either
with
the
King
or
Prince
,
secretly
endeavour
to
set
both
against

<EOS>
such

be
Sir
Jocelyn
's
consistency
of
character
,
such
his
solidity
of
judgment
and
firmness
,
and
such
the
respect
he

secret

it
must
not
be
imagine
that
Sir
Jocelyn
's
whole
time
be
pass
in
attendance
on
the
court
.
<EOS>
not
a
day
fly
by
that
he
do
not
pay
a
visit
to
Aveline

She
have
take
a
little
cottage
,
where
she
dwell
in
perfect
seclusion
,
with
one
female
attendant

Dame

same
who
have
accompany
her
on
her
compulsory
visit
to
Sir
Giles
Mompesson,—and

father
's
faithful
old
servant
,
Anthony

<EOS>
to
this
retreat
,
situate
in
the
then
rural
neighbourhood
adjoin
Holborn
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
as
we
have
say
,
daily
repair
,
and
the
moment
so
spend
be
the
most
delicious
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
the
feeling
of
regard
entertain
for
him
from
the
first
by
Aveline
,
have
by
this
time
ripen
into
love
;
yet
,
mindful
of
her
solemn
promise
to
her
father
,
she
check
her
grow
affection
as
much
as
lie
in
her
power
,
and
would
not
,
at
first
,
permit
any
word
of
tenderness
to
be
utter
by
him
.
<EOS>
as
week
,
however
,
and
even
month
,
run
on
,
and
no
one
appear
to
claim
her
hand
,
she
begin
to
indulge
the
hope
that
the
year
of
probation
would
expire
without
molestation
,
and
insensibly
,
and
almost
before
she
be
aware
of
it
,
Sir
Jocelyn
have
become
complete
master
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
in
these
interview
,
he
tell
her
all
that
occur
to
him
at
court
—
acquaint
her
of
his
hope
of
aggrandisement
—
and
induce
her
to
listen
to
his
expectation
of
a
brilliant
future
,
to
be
share
by
them
together
.
<EOS>
the
severe
shock
Aveline
have
sustain
in
the
death
of
her
father
have
gradually
wear
away
,
and
,
if
not
free
from
occasional
depression
,
she
be
still
enable
to
take
a
more
cheerful
view
of
thing
.
<EOS>
never
have
she
see
Sir
Jocelyn
so
full
of
ardour
as
on
the
day
after
the
banquet
,
when
he
come
to
communicate
the
intelligence
of
the
joust
,
and
that
he
be
select
to
essay
his
skill
against
that
of
Buckingham
.
<EOS>
the
news
,
however
,
do
not
produce
upon
her
the
effect
he
expect
.
<EOS>
not
only
she
could
not
share
his
delight
,
but
she
be
seize
with
anticipation
of
come
ill
,
in
connection
with
this
event
,
for
which
she
could
not
account
.
<EOS>
nor
could
all
that
Jocelyn
say
remove
her
misgiving
;
and
,
in
consequence
,
their
meeting
be
sad
than
usual
.
<EOS>
on
the
next
day
,
these
foreboding
of
impend
calamity
be
most
unexpectedly
realise
.
<EOS>
a
mysterious
personage
,
wrap
in
a
long
black
cloak
,
and
wear
a
mask
,
enter
her
dwelling
without
stand
upon
the
ceremony
of
tap
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
His
presence
occasion
her
much
alarm
,
and
it
be
not
diminish
when
he
tell
her
,
in
a
stern
,
and
peremptory
tone
,
that
she
must
accompany
him
to
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
's
habitation
.
<EOS>
refuse
to
give
any
explanation
of
the
cause
of
this
strange
summon
,
he
say
she
would
do
well
to
comply
with
it,—that
,
indeed
,
resistance
would
be
idle
as
Sir
Giles
be
prepared
to
enforce
his
order
;
and
that
he
himself
would
he
responsible
for
her
safety
.
<EOS>
compel
to
be
satisfied
with
these
assurance
,
Aveline
yield
to
the
apparent
necessity

so
great
that
he
shudder
at
the
sight
of
a
draw
sword

and
abhor
the
mimic
representation
of
warfare
!
<EOS>
neither
be
the
rigorous
principle
of
honour
on
which
chivalry
be
base
,
nor
the
obligation
they
impose
,
better
suited
to
him
.
<EOS>
too
faithless
by
nature
to
adopt
the
law
of
a
Court
of
Honour
,
he
deride
the

as
obsolete
.
<EOS>
nevertheless

as
trial
of
skill
and
strength
in
the

he
be
compel

though
against
his

,
to
witness
them

in
some
degree
to
promote
them
.
<EOS>
the
day
of
his
accession
to
the
throne
—
the
24th
March
—
be
always
celebrate
by
tilt
and
run
at
the
ring
,
and
similar
display
be
invariably
make
in
honour
of
any
important
visitor
to
the
court
.
<EOS>
even
in
this
reign
something
of
a
revival
of
the
ancient
ardour
for
knightly
pastime
take
place
during
the
brief
career
of
Prince
Henry
,
who
,
if
he
have
live
to
fulfil
the
promise
of
his
youth
,
would
have
occupy
a
glorious
page
in
his
country
's
annal
,
and
have
save
it
,
in
all
probability
,
from
its
subsequent
convulsion
and
intestine
strife
.
<EOS>
inure
himself
betime
to
the
weight
of
armour
,
this
young
prince
become
exceedingly
expert
in
the
use
of
all
weapon
—
could
toss
the
pike
,
couch
the
lance
,
and
wield
the
sword
,
the
battle
-
axe
,
or
the
mace
,
well
than
any
one
of
his
year
.
<EOS>
the
tilt
-
yard
and
the
tennis
-
court
be
his
constant
place
of
resort
,
and
he
be
ever
engage
in
robust
exercise
—
too
much
so
,
indeed
,
for
a
somewhat
feeble
constitution
.
<EOS>
Prince
Henry
indulge
the
dream
of
win
back
Calais
from
France
,
and
would
no
doubt
have
attempt
the
achievement
if
he
have
live
.
<EOS>
of
a
more
reflective
cast
of
mind
than
his
eld
brother
,
and
with
taste
less
martial
,
Prince
Charles
still
sedulously
cultivate
all
the
accomplishment
,
proper
to
a
cavalier
.
<EOS>
a
perfect
horseman
,
and
well
skilled
in
all
the
practice
of
the
tilt

yard
<EOS>
—
he
be
a
model
of
courtesy
and
grace
;
but
he
have
not
Prince
Henry
's
feverish
and
consume
passion
for
martial
sport
,
nor
do
he
,
like
him
,
make
their
pursuit
the
sole
business
of
life
.
<EOS>
still
,
the
pure
flame
of
chivalry
burn
within
his
breast
,
and
he
fully
recognise
its
high
and
ennobling
principle
,
and
accept
the
obligation
they
impose
.
<EOS>
and
in
this
respect
,
as
in
most
other
,
he
differ
essentially
from
his
august
father

from
the
summit
of
one
of
the
tall
turret
of
the
Holbein
Gate
,
the
appearance
of
the
palace
of
Whitehall
,
at
the
period
of
our
history
,
be
exceedingly
picturesque
and
striking
—
perhaps
more
so
than
at
any
previous
or
subsequent
epoch
,
since
the
various
structure
of
which
it
be
compose
be
just
old
enough
to
have
acquire
a

honour
character
,
while
they
be
still
in
tolerable
preservation
.
<EOS>
let
us
glance
at
it
,
then
,
from
this
point
,
and
first
turn
towards
the
great
Banqueting
House
,
which
present
to
us
a
noble
and
lengthen
façade
,
and
contain
within
a
magnificent
and
lofty
hall
,
occupy
nearly
its
full
extent
,
besides
several
other
apartment
of
regal
size
and
splendour
.
<EOS>
in
this
building
,
in
former
day
,
with
a
retinue
as
princely
as
that
of
the
King
himself
,
Wolsey
so
often
and
so
sumptuously
entertain
his
royal
master
,
that
he
at
last
provoke
his
anger
by
his
ostentation
,
and
be
bereft
of
his
superb
abode
.
<EOS>
satisfied
with
our
examination
of
the
Banqueting
House
,
we
will
suffer
our
gaze
to
fall
upon
the
broad
court
beyond
it
,
and
upon
the
numerous
irregular
but
picturesque
and
beautiful
structure
by
which
that
court
—
quadrangle
it
can
not
be
call
,
for
no
uniformity
be
observe
in
the
disposition
of
the
building
—
be

.
<EOS>
here
the
eye
be
attract
by
a
confused
mass
of
roof
,
some
flat
,
turrete
and
embattle
,
some
point
,
with
fantastical
gable
and
stack
of
tall
chimney
—
other
with
cupolas
and
tall
clock
-
tower
—
other
with
crocketed
pinnacle
,
and
almost
all
with
large

a

and
so
be
it
with
Whitehall
.
<EOS>
It
have
two
other
court
besides
the
one
we
be
survey
;
equally
crowd
round
with
building
,
equally
want
in

,
but
equally
picturesque
.
<EOS>
on
the
east
it
extend
to
Scotland
Yard
,
and
on
the
west
to
the
open
space
in
front
of
Westminster
Hall

<EOS>
the
state
apartment
face
the
river
,
and
their
large
window
look
upon
the
stream
.
<EOS>
quit
the
exalted
position
we
have
hitherto
assume
,
and
view
Whitehall
from
some
bark
on
the
Thames
,
we
shall
find
that
it
have
a
stern
and
sombre
look
,
be
castellate
,
in
part
,
with
tower
like
those
over
Traitor

<EOS>
again

we

on
the
south
of

,
and
connect
with
the
state

,
a
long
ambulatory

call
the

<EOS>
then
return
to
our
first

of
observation

and
take
a
bird's
-
eye
view
of
the
whole
,
after
examine
it
in
detail
,
as
before
mention
,
we
come
to
the
conclusion
,
that
,
though
irregular
in
the
extreme
,
and
with
no
pretension
whatever
to
plan
in
its
arrangement
,
the
Palace
of
Whitehall
be
eminently
picturesque

and
impose
from
its
vast
extent
.
<EOS>
if

in

with

the

X.The

Westminster

<EOS>
the
throng
outside
the
gate
of
Whitehall
feel
their
breast
dilate
,
and
their
pulse
dance
,
as
they
listen
to
the
flourish
of
the
trumpet

cornet
,
the
thundering
bruit
of
the

<EOS>
It
be
,
in
sooth
,
a
goodly
sight
to
see
the
long
and
brilliant
procession
form
by
the
fourteen
knight
,
each
so
gallantly
mount
,
so
splendidly
accoutre
,
and
accompany
by
such
a
host
of
gentleman
usher
,
page
,
yeoman
,
and
groom
,
some
on
horseback
,
and
some
on
foot
;
and
the
eye
of
the
looker
-
on
be
never
weary
of
notice
the
diversity
of
their
habiliments,—some
of
the
knight
have
cuirass
and
helmet
,
polish
as
silver
,
and
reflect
the
sun

ray
as
from

black

the
case
with
the
harness
of
<EOS>
Prince
Charles,—and
one
,
a
dead
black
coat
of

,
in
the
instance
of
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
the
arm
of
each
be
slightly
varied
,
either
in
make
or
ornament
.
<EOS>
a
few
wear
sash
across
their
breastplate
,
and
several
have
knot
of
riband
tie
above
the
coronal
of
their
lance
,
which
be
bear
by
their
esquire
.
<EOS>
in
order
to
give
the
vast
crowd
assemble
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Whitehall
,
an
opportunity
of
witness
as
much
as
possible
of
the
chivalrous
spectacle
,
it
be
arrange
by
Prince
Charles
that
the
line
of
the
procession
should
first
take
its
course
through
the
Holbein
Grate
,
and
then
,
keep
near
the
wall
of
the
Privy
Garden
,
should
pass
beneath
the
King
's
Gate
and
draw
up
for
a
short
time
in
the
Old
Palace
-
yard
near
Westminster
-
hall
,
where
a
great
concourse
be
assemble
,
amidst
which
a
space
be
keep
clear
by
party
of
halberdier
and
yeoman
of
the
guard
.
<EOS>
the
procession
be
head
by
the
Prince
,
and
the
stately
step
of
his
milk
-
white
charger
well
beseem
his
own
majestic
deportment
.
<EOS>
when
the
long
train
of
gentleman
-
usher
and
page
accompany
him
have
move
on
,
so
as
to
leave
the
course
clear
for
the
next
comer
and
his
follower
,
a
young
knight
present
himself
,
who
,
more
than
any
other
in
the
procession
,
attract
the
attention
of
the
spectator
.
<EOS>
this
youthful
knight
's
visor
be
raise
so
as
to
disclose
his
feature
,
and
these
be
so
comely
,
that
,
combine
with
his
finely
-
proportion
figure
,
perfectly
display
by
his
armour
,
he
offer
an
ensemble
of
manly
attraction
almost
irresistible
to
female
eye
.
<EOS>
nor
do
the
grace
and
skill
which
he
exhibit
in
the
management
of
his
steed
commend
him
less
highly
to
sterner
judge
,
who
do
not
fail
to
discover
that
his
limb
,
though
light
,
be
in
the
high
degree
vigorous
and
athletic
,
and
they
prognosticate
most
favourably
of
his
chance
of
success
in
the
joust
.
<EOS>
when
it
become
known
that
this
preux
chevalier
be
Sir
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
,
the
choose
antagonist
of
Buckingham
,
still
great
attention
be
bestow
upon
him
;
and
as
his
good
look
and
gallant
bearing
operate
strongly
,
as
we
have
state
,
in
his
favour
,
many
a
good
wish
and
lusty
cheer
be
utter
for
him
.
<EOS>
the
effect
of
all
this
excitement
among
the
crowd
on
behalf
of
Mounchensey
be
to
render
Buckingham
's
reception
by
the
same
person
comparatively
cold
;
and
the
cheer
give
for
the
magnificent
favourite
and
his
princely
retinue
be
so
few
and
so
want
in
spirit
,
that
he
who
be
wholly
unaccustomed
to
such
neglect
,
and
who
have
be
jealously
listen
to
the
cheer
attend
Mounchensey
's
progress
,
be
highly
offend
,
and
could
scarcely
conceal
his
displeasure
.
<EOS>
but
if
he
be
indignant
at
his
own
reception
,
he
be
exasperate
at
the
treatment
experience
by
his
ally
.
<EOS>
close
behind
him
ride
a
knight
in
black
armour
,
with
a
sable
panache
on
his
helm
.
<EOS>
Stalwart
limb
and
a
manly
bearing
have
this
knight
,
and
he
bestrode
his
powerful
charger
like
one
well
accustomed
to
the
saddle
;
but
though
no
one
could
gainsay
his
skill
as
a
horseman
,
or
his
possible
prowess
as
a
man
-
at
-
arm
,
most
think
he
have
no
title
to
be
there
,
and
give
unmistakable
evidence
of
their
conviction
by
groan
and
hooting
.
<EOS>
this
black
knight
be
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
,
and
very
grim
and
menacing
<EOS>
be
his
aspect
.
<EOS>
ample
accommodation
for
the
knightly
company
and
their
attendant
,
as
well
as
for
the
multitude
congregate
to
behold
them
be
afford
by
the
broad
area
in
front
of
Westminster
Hall
;
nevertheless
,
as
those
in
the
rear
could
not
see
as
well
as
those
in
front
,
every
chance
elevation
offer
a
well
view
be
eagerly
seize
upon
.
<EOS>
all
the
accessible
point
of
Westminster
Hall
—
its
carved
porch
and
window
—
be
invade
.
<EOS>
so
be
the
gate
of
the
Old
Palace
hard
by
—
so
be
the
buttress
of
the
Abbey
;
and
man
be
perch
,
like
grotesque
ornament
,
on
crocketed
pinnacle
and
stone
water
-
spout
.
<EOS>
the
tall
and
curiously

paint
clock
tower
,
resemble
an
italian
campanile
,
which
then
face
the
portal
of
Westminster
Hall
,
be
cover
with
spectator
.
<EOS>
but
the
position
most
coveted
,
and
esteem
the
good
,
be
the
fountain
at
that
time
stand
in
the
midst
of
the
old
palace
-
yard
.
<EOS>
this
structure
,
which
be
of
great
antiquity
and
beauty
,
with
a
pointed
summit
support
by
tall
slender
shaft
,
and
a
large
basin
beneath
,
form
a
sort
of
pivot
,
round
which
the
procession
turn
as
it
arrive
upon
the
ground
,
and
consequently
form
the
good
point
of
view
of
all
;
and
those
be
esteem
highly
fortunate
who
manage
to
obtain
a
place
upon
it
.
<EOS>
amongst
these
lucky
individual
be
three
of
the
reader
's
acquaintance
,
and
we
think
he
will
scarce
fail
to
recognise
the
saucy
-
face
apprentice
with
the
cudgel
under
his
arm
,
and
the
fair
-
haired
,
blue
-
eyed
,
country
-
look
maiden
at
his
side
,
as
well
as
the
hale
old
rustic
by
whom
they
be
attend
.
<EOS>
all
three
be
delighted
with
their
position
,
and
Dick
Taverner
take
full
credit
to
himself
for
his
cleverness
in
procure
it
for
them
.
<EOS>
as
to
pretty
Gillian
,
nothing
could
please
her
well
,
for
she
could
not
only
see
all
that
be
go
forward
,
but
everybody
could
see
her
—
even
Prince
Charles
himself
;
and
she
flatter
herself
that
she
attraete
no
little
attention
.
<EOS>
and
now
that
the
whole
of
the
procession
have
come
up
,
the
picture
be
certainly
magnificent
,
and
well
worth
contemplation
.
<EOS>
everything
be
favourable
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
spectacle
.
<EOS>
the
day
be
bright
and
beautiful
,
and
a
sparkling
sunshine
light
up
the
splendid
accoutrement
of
the
knight
,
the
gorgeous
caparison
of
their
steed
,
and
the
rich
habiliment
of
their
attendant
;
while
a
gentle
breeze
stir
the
plume
upon
the
helmet
,
and
flutter
the
bandrol
on
their
lance
.
<EOS>
the
effect
be
heighten
by
enliven
strain
of
minstrelsy
,
and
the
fanfare
of
the
trumpeter
.
<EOS>
the
utmost
enthusiasm
be
awaken
among
the
spectator
,
and
their
acclamation
be
loud
and
long

<EOS>
at
this
juncture

Dick
Taverner

who
have
be

as
lustily
as
the
rest
,
toss
his
cap
in
the
air

and
catch
it
dexterously
as
it
fall
,
hold
his
breath
and
clap
his
bonnet
on
his
head
,
for
an
object
meet
his
eye
which
fix
his
attention

<EOS>
It
be
the
sombre
figure
of
a
knight
accoutre
in
black
armour
,
who
be
press
his
steed
through
the
throng
in
the
direction
of

<EOS>
His
beaver

"You

"IllustrationBut

so

he

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
Nowise

Dick

would

follow

terrified
by

if

he

CHAPTER
XI.The
Tilt
-
Yard
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
procession
be
pursue
its
slow
course
towards
the
tilt
-
yard
.
<EOS>
It
return
by
the
route
it
have
take
in
come
;
but
it
now
keep
on
the
north
side
of
King
Street
,
which
thoroughfare
be
divide
in
the
midst
by
a
railing
,
and
deeply
sanded
.
<EOS>
here
,
as
in
the
area
before
Westminster
-
hall
,
not
a
wall
,
not
a
window
,
not
a
roof
,
but
have
its
occupant
.
<EOS>
the
tower
of
the
two
great
gate
be
throng
—
so
be
the
roof
of
the
tennis
-
court
and
the
manége
,
and
the
summit
of
the
cock
-
pit
;
the
latter
,
indeed
,
be
a
capital
position
inasmuch
as
it
not
only
afford
an
excellent
view
of
the
procession
,
but
command
the
interior
of
the
tilt
-
yard
.
<EOS>
no
wonder
,
therefore
,
that
great
effort
should
be
make
to
obtain
a
place
upon
it
,
nor
be
it
surprising
that
our
old
friend
,
Madame
Bonaventure
,
who
have
by
no
means
lose
her
influence
among
the
court
gallant
,
though
she
lack
,
the
support
of
Lord
Roos
,
owe
to
the
absence
of
that
young
nobleman
upon
his
travels,—it
be
not
surprising
,
we
say
,
that
she
should
be
among
the
favour
individual
who
have
secure
a
position
there
.
<EOS>
undoubtedly
,
she
would
have
prefer
a
seat
amongst
the
court
dam
in
the
gallery
of
the
tilt
-
yard
,
but
as
this
be
unattainable
,
she
be
oblige
to
be
content
;
and
,
indeed
,
she
have
no
reason
to
complain
,
for
she
see
quite
as
much
as
those
inside
,
and
be
more
at
her
ease
.
<EOS>
from
this
exalted
position
,
while
listen
to
the
inspirit
clangour
of
the
trumpet
,
the
clattering
of
arm
,
and
the
trampling
and
neighing
of
steed
,
Madame
Bonaventure
could
scrutinize
the
deportment
of
each
knight
as
he
issue
from
the
lofty
arch
of
the
Holbein
Gate
,
and
ride
slowly
past
her
.
<EOS>
She
have
ample
time
to
count
the
number
of
his
attendant
before
he
disappear
from
her
view
.
<EOS>
as
Sir
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
approach
,
with
his
visor
raise
,
and
his
countenance
radiant
with
smile
at
the
cheer
he
have
receive
,
she
recognise
in
him
her
former
guest
,
and
participate
in
the
general
enthusiasm
,
prevail
for
the
young
knight
,
she
lean
over
the
parapet
,
and
address
to
him
a
greeting
so
hearty
that
it
procure
for
her
a
courteous
salutation
in
return
.
<EOS>
enchant
with
this
,
she
follow
with
her
eye
the
graceful
figure
of
Sir
Jocelyn
till
it
be
lose
to

—
to

over
the

of

<EOS>
she

espy
him

in
conference
with

and
some

of

<EOS>

behind
the
court

rich

,
laugh
and
jest
with
them
on
the

of
the

they
have
come

<EOS>
She

and
the

while
thick

could
be
let
down
at
the

to
screen

if

<EOS>
here
it
be

that
the

and
his

companion
-
at

should
assemble
,
and
wait
till

by
the

<EOS>
there

similar
place
of

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
like

<EOS>
this
be
what
Madame

beheld
from
the
roof
of

and
a
very
pretty

<EOS>
all

it
will
be

be
in

in

<EOS>
the
arrival
of
the
King
seem
to
be
impatiently
expect
—
not
only
by
the
knight
who
be
eager
to
display
their
prowess
,
but
by
the
court
dame
and
the
gallant

them
,
as
well
as
by
all
the
official
scatter
about
in
different
part
of

and

by
their
variegate

<EOS>
the
Marquis

<EOS>
His
career
be
execute
with
all
the
consummate
address
for
which
the
favourite
be
remarkable
,
and
it
appear
certain
that
he
would
carry

the
prize
;
but
in
lower
his
lance
he
do
not
make
sufficient
allowance
for
the
wind

and
this

slightly
to
swerve

and
though

.
<EOS>
the
course
,
however
,
be
consider

failure

to
the

till
the
moment
of
set
forward
,
he
make
a
demi

volte
to
the
right
,
and
then
gracefully
raise
his
lance
,
as
his
steed
start
on
its
career
,
he
continue
to
hold
it
aloft
until
he
begin
to
near
the
object
of
his
aim
,
<EOS>
when
he
gently
and
firmly
allow
the
point
to
decline
over
the
right
ear
of
his
horse
,
and
adjust
it
in
a
line
with

<EOS>
His
aim
prove
so
unerring
that

CHAPTER
XII.The
<EOS>
Tilting
Match
.
<EOS>
after
all
the
other
competitor
for
the
prize
have
essay
a
career
within
the
arena
,
Sir
Jocelyn
's
be
hold
to
be
the
good
course
run
.
<EOS>
the
ring
be
again
carry
off
both
by
the
Earl
of
Pembroke
and
Lord
Mordaunt
;
but
in
the
opinion
of
the
marshal
of
the
field
,
neither
of
those
nobleman
display
so
much
grace
and
skill
as
Mounchensey
:
and
the
decision
be
confirm
by
the
King
.
<EOS>
the
applause
which
ring
through
the
tilt
-
yard
,
on
the
announcement
that
our
handsome
young
knight
have
gain
the
first
course
,
increase
the
bitterness
of
Buckingham
's
feeling
towards
him
;
and
he
express
his
regret
in
a
low
tone
to
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
that
the
combat
about
to
take
place
be
not
à
l'outrance
instead
of
be
à
plaisance
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
smile
grimly
in
reply
.
<EOS>
some
little
time
elapse
,
during
which
preparation
be
make
for
the
tilting
-
match
,
and
great
excitement
pervade
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
the
King
laughingly
inquire
of
the
spanish
ambassador
if
he
still
feel
secure
of
win
his
wager
,
and
be
answer
by
De
Gondomar
that
he
have
never
have
the
slight
misgiving
on
the
subject
,
but
he
be
now
better
satisfied
than
ever
that
the
result
of
the
come
struggle
would
justify
his
expectation
.
<EOS>
in
the
lady
'
gallery
an
unusual
degree
of
interest
be
manifest
in
what
be
go
forward
;
and
many
a
wish
be
audibly
express
by
many
a
fair
dame
in
Mounchensey
's
favour
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
the
trumpet
sound
,
and
the
cry
of
the
herald
be
hear
,
cheer
on
the
combatant
,
as
they
prepare
to
dash
furiously
against
each
other
,
bid
them
do
their
devoir
bravely
,
since
bright
eye
look
down
upon
them
.
<EOS>
these
stimulant
to
valorous
display
be
scarcely
need
,
for
the
champion
be
eager
to
prove
their
prowess
.
<EOS>
issue
one
by
one
,
from
beneath
their
respective
scaffold
,
and
curb
the
impatience
of
their
steed
till
they
receive
from
the
marshal
permission
to
start
,
they
rush
from
their
post
with
lightning
swiftness
to
meet
with
a
crash
shock
midway
.
<EOS>
various
success
attend
the
different
combatant
,
but
on
the
whole
the
advantage
lie
clearly
on
the
side
of
the
Duke
of
Lennox
,
none
of
whose
party
have
sustain
any
material
discomfiture
;
while
on
the
side
of
Prince
Charles
,
the
Earls
of
Montgomery
and
Rutland
have
be
unhorse
.
<EOS>
the
interest
of
the
spectator
be
keep
in
breathless
suspense
to
the
last
,
it
be
arrange
that
the
tilting
-
match
should
close
with
the
conflict
between
Buckingham
and
Mounchensey
.
<EOS>
thus
,
when
the
trumpet
sound
for
the
seventh
and
last
time
,
and
the
two
knight
station
themselves
opposite
each
other
,
every
eye
be
intently
fix
upon
them
.
<EOS>
apparently
,
no
two
antagonist
could
be
well
or
more
equally
match
than
they
be
;
and
throughout
the
whole
field
it
would
have
be
in
vain
to
search
for
another
pair
equally
gift
by
nature
,
both
be
model
of
manly
beauty
of
feature
and
symmetry
of
frame
.
<EOS>
indeed
they
may
have
be
cast
in
the
same
mould
,
so
nearly
alike
be
they
in
shape
and
size
;
and
if
their
armour
have
be
similar
,
and
their
steed
correspond
in
colour
,
they
would
have
be
undistinguishable
,
when
apart
.
<EOS>
Buckingham
in
some
respect
present
the
noble
figure
of
the
two
,
owe
to
his
flow
plume
,
his
embossed
and
inlaid
armour
,
and
the
magnificent
housing
of
his
charger
—
but
he
be
fully
rival
by
the
grace
and
chivalrous
air
of

the
mortification

and
perhaps
be
never

to
such
advantage
as
at
this
proud
and
happy
moment

<EOS>
His
emotion
be
indeed
enviable
—
but
one
thing
be
want
to
complete
his
satisfaction
—
the
presence
of
her

before

of

what

by
some
of

<EOS>
what
matter
it
that
his

and
that
glove
and
knot
of
riband
fall
at
his
foot
,
as
he
ride
past
the
lady

<EOS>
His
heart
be
untouched
by
smile
or
glance
,
and
he
pause
not
to
pick
up
one
of
the
favour
shower
upon
him
.
<EOS>
but
what
mean
this
sudden
change
in
his
demeanour
?
<EOS>
why
do
he
start
and
stop
,
and
look
inquiringly
towards
the
back
of
the
gallery
?
<EOS>
whom
do
he
discern
amongst
that
bevy
of
beauty
?
<EOS>
Can
it
be
aveline

<EOS>
and
if
so

how

all

that

Her

<EOS>
She

<EOS>
She
would
muffle
up
her

,
but
it
be
too
late
;
and
she
be
not
only
fully
expose
to
his
view
,
but
to
that
of
a
hundred
other
curious
eye
.
<EOS>
though
many
a
high

bear
damsel
marvel
at
the
young
knight
's
insensibility
to
her
own
superior
attraction
,
none
can
deny
that
the
unknown
maiden
be
exquisitely
beautiful
,
and
demand
be
eagerly

as
to
who
she
may
be
.
<EOS>
no
one
can
answer
—
and
no
clue
be

by
her
companion
,
for
the
elderly
dame
by
whom
she

a
favour
from
the
lady

she
can
not

for
immediately

aside

to
let

<EOS>
with
her
pale
cheek
crimson
with
blush

and
her
dark
eye
flash
with
mingled
emotion
of
shame
and
pleasure
,
Aveline

forward
—
and
have
no
other
favour
to
bestow
upon
her
knight
,
she
give
him
her
kerchief
,
which
he

to
his
lip
,
and
then
with
a
graceful
salutation
move
forward
on

He

the
brief
interview
between
the

<EOS>
He
care
not
what
transport

you
I

Sir

draw
your
sword
at
once

let
it
be
a
mortal
combat
between
us

""Never

Sir
Jocelyn

I

Sir
Giles

a
terrible
blow
at
him
with
his
sword

<EOS>
if
the
stroke
have
take
effect
as
intend
,
it
would
probably
have
make
good
Mompesson
's
threat
,
but
Sir
Jocelyn
be
too
wary
and
too
agile
even
for
his
powerful
assailant
.
<EOS>
before
the
sword
could
descend
,
he
seize
his
adversary
's
wrist
,
and
in
another
instant
possess
himself
of
the
blade
.
<EOS>
this
he
accomplish
without
injury
,
as
the
sword
be
blunt
.
<EOS>
still
maintain
his
grasp
of
the
weapon
,
he
raise
himself
in
his
stirrup
to
give
additional
force
to
the
blow
,
and
with
the
pummel
of
the
sword
,
strike
Sir
Giles
a
blow
upon
the
brainpan
with
such
violence
,
that
he
drop
from
the
saddle
as
if
shot
.
<EOS>
during
this
strange
scene
,
not
a
word
have
be
utter
by
the
spectator
,
who
look
on
with
the
great
curiosity
,
wonder
how
it
would
end

<EOS>
as
Sir
Giles
fall
from
his
horse
,
and
lie
stretch
in
perfect
insensibility
on
the
ground
,
a
tremendous
shout
be
raise
,

Sir
Jocelyn
be
as
much
applaud

extraordinary
feat

afterwards

livid

with

XIV.The
<EOS>
private
Cabinet
of
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
a
small
room
,
and
render
yet
small
by
the
numerous
chest
and
strong
box
encroach
upon
its
narrow
limit
.
<EOS>
in
some
case
these
box
be
pile
,
one
upon
another
,
till
they
touch
the
ceiling
.
<EOS>
all
of
them
look
stout
enough
,
yet
many
be
further
strengthen
by
iron
hoop
and
broad
-
head
nail
,
and
secure
by
huge
padlock
.
<EOS>
the
door
be
case
with
iron
,
within
and
without
,
and
have
a
ponderous
lock
,
of
which
the
master
of
the
room
always
keep
the
key
,
and
never
trust
it
out
of
his
own
hand
.
<EOS>
this
small
chamber
be
the
private
cabinet
of
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
no
one
be
permit
to
enter
it
without
him
.
<EOS>
though
his
myrmidon
be
fully
aware
of
its
existence
,
and
can
give
a
shrewd
guess
at
its
content
,
only
two
of
them
have
set
foot
within
it
.
<EOS>
the
two
thus
privileged
be
Clement
Lanyere
and
Lupo
Vulp
.
<EOS>
neither
the
promoter
nor
the
scrivener
be
much
in
the
habit
of
talk
over
their
master
's
affair
,
even
with
their
comrade
,
and
be
almost
as
habitually
reserve
as
he
be
himself
;
still
,
from
the
few
word
let
fall
by
them
from
time
to
time
,
the
myrmidon
have
pick
up
a
tolerable
notion
of
the
private
cabinet
,
of
its
hide
cupboard
in
the
wall
,
its
drawer
with
secret
spring
;
its
slide
plank
with
hollow
beneath
them
;
its
chest
full
of
treasure
,
or
what
be
the
same
thing
as
treasure
,
bond
,
mortgage
-
deed
,
and
other
security
;
and
its
carefully
conceal
hoard
of
plate
,
jewel
,
and
other
valuable
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
least
scrupulous
among
them
—
such
as
stare
,
Hugh
,
Cutting
Dick
,
and
old
Tom
Wootton
—
have
often
discuss
the
possibility
of
secretly
visit
it
,
and
make
a
perquisition
of
its
store
;
but
they
have
be
hitherto
restrain
by
their
fear
of
their
terrible
and
vindictive
master
.
<EOS>
on
look
into
the
cabinet
we
find
Sir
Giles
seat
at
a
table
,
with
a
large
chest
open
beside
him
,
from
which
he
have
take
for
examination
sundry
yellow
parchment
,
with
large
seal
attach
to
them
.
<EOS>
He
be
now
occupy
with
a
deed
,
on
one
of
the
skin
of
which
the
plan
of
an
important
estate
be
paint
,
and
on
this
his
attention
become
fix
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
be
cadaverous
,
and
its
ghastly
hue
add
to
its
grimness
of
expression
.
<EOS>
a
band
be
tie
round
his
head
,
and
there
be
an
expression
of
pain
in
his
face
,
and
an
air
of
languor
and
debility
in
his
manner
,
very
different
from
what
be
usual
with
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
plain
he
have
not
yet
recover
from
the
effect
of
the
crush
blow
he
receive
at
the
joust
.
<EOS>
opposite
him
sit
his
partner
,
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
;
and
the
silence
that
have
reign
between
them
for
some
minute
be
first
break
by
the
old
usurer
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
Sir
Giles
,
"
he
inquire
,
"
be
you
satisfied
with
your
examination
of
these
deed
of
the
Mounchensey
property
?
<EOS>
the
estate
have
be
in
the
family
,
as
you
see
,
for
upward
of
two
century
—
ever
since
the
reign
of
Henry
IV
.
,
in
fact
—
and
you
have
a
clear
and
undisputed
title
to
all
the
property
depict
on
that
plan
—
to
an
old
hall
with
a
large
park
around
it
,
eight
mile
in
circumference
,
and
almost
as
well
stock
with
deer
as
the
royal
chase
of
Theobald
's
;
and
you
have
a
title
to
other
territorial
domain
extend
from
Mounchensey
Place
and
Park
to
the
coast
,
a
matter
of
twelve
mile
as
the
crow
fly

Sir
Giles,—and
include
three
manor
and
a
score
of
little
village

Will
not
these
content
you
?
<EOS>
methink
they
should

<EOS>
I
'
faith

my
worthy
partner

when
I
come
to
reckon
up
all
your
possession
,
your
house
and
land
,
and
your
different
source
of
revenue
—
the
sum
owe
to
you
in
bond
and
mortgage
—
your
monopoly
and
your
patent
—
when
I
reckon
up
all
these
,
I
say
,
and
add
thereunto
the
wealth
hoard
in
this
cabinet
,
which
you
have
not
place
out
at
usance
<EOS>
—
I
do
not
hesitate
to
set
you
down
as
one
of
the
rich
of
my
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
there
be
few
whose
revenue
be
so
large
as
yours
,
Sir
Giles

'
<EOS>
Tis
strange
,
though
I
have
have
the
same
chance
as
yourself
of
make
money
,
I
have
not
a
hundredth
part
of
your
wealth
.
<EOS>
""Not
a
whit
strange
,
"
reply
Sir
Giles
,
lay
down
the
deed
and
regard
his
partner
somewhat
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
I
waste
not
what
I
acquire
.
<EOS>
I
have
passion
as
well
as
yourself
,
Sir
Francis
;
but
I
keep
them
under
subjection
.
<EOS>
I
drink
not
—
I
riot
not
—
I
shun
all
idle
company
.
<EOS>
I
care
not
for
outward
show
,
or
for
the
vanity
of
dress
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
one
passion
which
I
indulge,—revenge
.
<EOS>
You
be
a
slave
to
sensuality
,
and
pamper
your
lust
at
any
cost
.
<EOS>
let
a
fair
woman
please
your
eye
,
and
she
must
be
buy
,
be
the
price
what
it
may
.
<EOS>
no
court
prodigal
be
ever
more
licentious
or
extravagant
than
you
be
.
<EOS>
""Sir
gile
!
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
!
<EOS>
I
pray
you
,
spare
me
.
<EOS>
My
enemy
could
not
report
bad
of
me
.
<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
your
enemy
would
say
that
your
extravagance
be
your
sole
merit
,
and
that
therein
you

well
than
I
,
"
rejoin
Sir
Giles
,
with
a
sardonic
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
rejoice
to
think
I
be
free
from
all
such
weakness
.
<EOS>
the
veri
enchantress
could
not
tempt
me

<EOS>
I
be
proof
against
all
female
seduction

<EOS>
think
you
the
damsel
live
who
could
induce
me
to
give
for
her
half
these
broad
land
in
Norfolk
—
this
ancient
hall
,
and
its
wide
-
spread
domain
?
<EOS>
I
trow
not
.
<EOS>
""Perchance
I
have
give
too
much
,
"
cry
the
old
usurer
,
eagerly
;
"
if
so
,
it
be
not
too
late
to
amend
our
contract
.
<EOS>
between
us
,
there
should
be
fair
dealing
,
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
""There
be
none
other
than
fair
dealing
on
my
part
,
"
reply
the
extortioner
sternly
;
"
and
the
term
of
our
agreement
can
not
be
depart
from
.
<EOS>
what
I
have
just
say
applie
to
your
general
mode
of
life
;
but
you
have
well
reason
for
your
conduct
in
this
instance
than
be
usual
with
you
,
since
you
combine
the
gratification
of
revenge
with
the
indulgence
of
your
other
passion
.
<EOS>
You
obtain
a
fair
young
bride
,
and
at
the
same
time
deprive
the
person
whom
you
hate
most
of
all
other
,
of
the
mistress
of
his
affection
.
<EOS>
this
be
as
it
should
be
.
<EOS>
vengeance
can
not
be
too
dearly
purchase
,
and
the
more
refine
the
vengeance
<EOS>
,
the
high
must
necessarily
be
the
price
pay
for
it
.
<EOS>
in
no
way
can
you
so
cruelly
injure
this
detest
Mounchensey
,
as
by
rob
him
of
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
and
the
blow
deal
by
you
,
shall
be
follow
by
other
not
less
severe
on
my
part
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
ay
,
Sir
Giles
,
you
have
to
wipe
out
the
outrage
he
inflict
upon
you
in
the
tilt

yard

<EOS>
as
I
be

true
gentleman

that
be
bad
than
the
indignity
I
endure
from
him
in

court

yard
of
the
palace

<EOS>
It
must
be
confess
that
the
villain
hath
a
powerful
hand
as
well
as
a
sharp
tongue
,
and
follow
up
his
bitter
word
by
bold
deed

<EOS>
the
stroke
he
deal
you
with
his
sword
be
like
a
blow
from
a
sledge
hammer

Sir
Giles

<EOS>
He
fell
you
from
your
horse
as
a
butcher
felleth

ox

,
in
good
truth

I
at
first

for
twelve

upward
you

senseless

speechless;—but

the
skill

Luke
Hatton
the
apothecary
who
tend
you

you
have

bring

<EOS>
after
such
treatment
,
I
can
not
wonder
that
you
be
eager
for
revenge
upon
Sir
Jocelyn

<EOS>
how

Sir
Giles

<EOS>

immure

""While

how
be
I
to
assert
my
claim
to
her
hand
—
how
enforce
it
when
make
?
<EOS>
explain
that
to
me

Sir

I
beseech
you

<EOS>
""Readily

the
extortioner

<EOS>

before
do
so
let
me
give
you
a
piece
of
information
which
will
surprise
you
,
and
which
will
show
you
that
my
tenure
of
this
great
Norfolk
property
be
not
quite
so
secure
as
you
suppose
it

<EOS>
You
be
aware
that
Sir

Mounchensey
have
a
young
brother
,
<EOS>
Osmond—""Who
disappear

very
young

he
be
never

it
be
lucky

he
do
so
die
,
or
he
may
have
prove
a
serious
obstacle
to
our
seizure
of
these
estate
,
for
I
remember
it
be
state
at
the
time

by
one

judge
,
that
have
he
be
live
,
he
may
have
procure
a
reversal
of

Chamber

upon
Sir

""Precisely
<EOS>
so
,

that
judge
's
opinion
be
correct

"
say
Sir
Giles

<EOS>
"
now
listen
to
me
,
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
true
that
Osmond
Mounchensey
quit
his
home
when
very
young
,
owe
to
some
family
quarrel
;
but
it
be
not
true
that
he
die
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
I
have
recently
ascertain
,
beyond
a
doubt
,
that
he
be
still
alive
.
<EOS>
hitherto
,
I
have
fail
in
trace
him
out
,
though
I
have
get
a
clue
to
him
;
but
he
have
envelop
himself
in
so
much
mystery
that
he
be
difficult
of
detection
.
<EOS>
yet
I
trust
to
succeed
ere
long
;
and
my
great
business
will
be
to
prevent
his
re
-
appearance
,
which
would
be
fraught
with
danger
to
us
both

<EOS>
I
have
a
scheme
on
foot

reference
to
him

will
answer
more
than
one
purpose
.
<EOS>
You
will
learn
it
anon

<EOS>

now
,
to
give
you
the
explanation
you
require
in
respect

Aveline

"You

a
brief
pause

Story

<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
tale
shall
be
briefly
tell
,
"
say
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
aware
,
Sir
Francis
,
that
in
the
pursuit
of
my
avocation
I
be
often
lead
into
the
most
dangerous
quarter
of
the
metropolis
,
and
at
hour
when
the
peril
to
any
honest
man
be
double
.
<EOS>
adventure
have
not
unfrequently
occur
to
me
when
so
circumstanced
,
and
I
have
be
indebte
to
my
right
hand
and
my
good
sword
for
deliverance
from
many
a
desperate
risk
.
<EOS>
late
one
night
,
I
chance
to
be
in
the
neighbourhood
of
whitefriar
,
in
a
place
call
the
Wilderness
,
when
,
hear
cry
for
help
,
accompany
by
the
clash
of
steel
,
I
rush
towards
a
narrow
court
,
whence
the
clatter
and
vociferation
resound
,
and
perceive
by
the
light
of
the
moon
,
which
fortunately
happen
to
be
shine
brightly
at
the
time
,
one
man
engage
with
four
other
,
who
be
evidently
bent
upon
cut
his
throat
in
order
to
take
his
purse
.
<EOS>
He
defend
himself
gallantly
,
but
the
odd
be
too
great
,
and
he
must
have
be
speedily
slay
—
for
the
villain
swear
with
great
oath
they
would
murder
him
if
he
continue
to
resist
them
—
if
I
have
not
come
to
the
rescue
.
<EOS>
I
arrive
just
in
time
.
<EOS>
They
be
press
him
hard
.
<EOS>
I
strike
down
the
point
of
a
rapier
which
be
within
an
inch
of
his
breast
—
give
the
swashbuckler
who
carry
it
a
riposta
he
do
not
expect
,
and
send
him
off
bowling
—
and
then
address
myself
to
the
other
with
such
good
effect
,
that
in
a
brief
space
the
stranger
and
<EOS>
I
be
alone
together
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
slightly
wound
in
the
fray
;
but
I
think
nothing
of
it
—
a
mere
scratch
.
<EOS>
It
seem
something
more
to
the
gentleman
I
have
preserve
.
<EOS>
He
express
great
concern
for
me
,
and
bind
his
handkerchief
round
my
arm
.
<EOS>
I
be
about
to
depart
,
but
he
detain
me
to
renew
his
profession
of
gratitude
for
the
service
I
have
render
him
,
and
his
earnest
wish
that
he
may
be
able
to
requite
me
.
<EOS>
from
his
discourse
,
and
from
the
text
of
Scripture
he
mix
up
with
it
,
I
know
him
to
be
a
Puritan
;
and
I
may
have
suppose
him
to
be
a
preacher
of
the
Gospel
,
have
he
not
carry
a
sword
,
and
borne
himself
so
manfully
in
the
encounter
.
<EOS>
however
,
he
leave
me
no
doubt
on
the
subject
,
for
he
tell
me
he
be
name
Hugh
Calveley
,
and
that
he
have
serve
in
the
war
with
more
honour
to
himself
than
profit
.
<EOS>
He
add
,
that
if
the
knave
have
succeed
in
their
design
,
and
rob
and
slain
him
,
they
would
have
deprive
his
daughter
of
her
sole
protector
;
and
,
indeed
,
of
all
mean
of
subsistence
,
since
the
little
they
have
would
be
lose
with
him
.
<EOS>
on
hear
this
,
a
thought
strike
me
,
and
I
say
to
him—'you
have
express
an
earnest
desire
to
requite
the
service
<EOS>
I
have
just
be
fortunate
enough
to
render
you
,
and
as
I
be
well
assure
your
profession
be
not
idly
make
,
I
shall
not
hesitate
to
proffer
a
request
to
you
.
'
'
<EOS>
ask
what
you
will
;
if
I
have
it
to
give
,
it
shall
be
yours
,
'
he
reply
.
'
<EOS>
You
make
that
promise
solemnly
,
and
before
heaven
?
'
<EOS>
I
say
.
<EOS>
'
I
make
it
solemnly
,
'
he
reply
.
'
<EOS>
and
to
prove
to
you
that
I
mean
it
to
be
bind
upon
me
,
I
will
confirm
it
by
an
oath
upon
the
Bible
.
'
<EOS>
and
as
he
speak
he
take
the
sacred
volume
from
his
doublet
,
and
reverently
kiss
it
.
<EOS>
then
I
say
to
him—'Sir
,
you
have
tell
me
you
have
a
daughter
,
but
you
have
not
tell
me
whether
she
be
marriageable
or
not
?
'
<EOS>
He
start
at
the
question
,
and
answer
somewhat
sternly
.
'
<EOS>
My
daughter
have
arrive
at
womanhood
.
<EOS>
but
wherefore
the
inquiry
?
<EOS>
do
you
seek
her
hand
in
marriage
?
'
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
if
I
do
so
,
would
you
refuse
her
to
me
?
'
<EOS>
a
pause
ensue
,
during
which
I
observe
he
be
struggle
with
deep
emotion
,
but
he
reply
at
last
,
'
I
could
not
do
so
after
my
solemn
promise
to
you
;
but
I
pray
you
not
to
make
the
demand
.
'
<EOS>
I
then
say
to
him
:
'
Sir
,
you
can
not
lay
any
restriction
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
exact
fulfilment
of
your
promise
.
<EOS>
Your
daughter
must
be
mine
.
'
<EOS>
again
he
seem
to
be
tear
by
emotion
,
and
to
meditate
a
refusal
;
but
after
a
while
he
suppress
his
feeling
,
and
reply
.
'
<EOS>
My
word
be
plight
.
<EOS>
She
shall
be
yours.—Ay
,
though
it
cost
me
my
life
,
she
shall
be
yours
.
'
<EOS>
He
then
inquire
my
name
and
station
,
and
I
give
him
a
different
name
from
that
by
which
I
be
know
;
in
fact
,
I
adopt
one
which
chance
to
be
familiar
to
him
,
and
which
instantly
change
his
feeling
towards
me
into
those
of
warm
friendship
.
<EOS>
as
you
may
well
suppose
,
I
do
not
think
fit
to
reveal
my
odious
profession
,
and
though
I
be
unmasked
,
I
contrive
so
to
muffle
my
hateful
visage
with
my
cloak
,
that
it
be
in
a
great
degree
conceal
from
him
.
<EOS>
after
this
,
I
tell
him
that
I
have
no
intention
of
press
my
demand
immediately
;
that
I
would
take
my
own
mean
of
see
his
daughter
without
her
be
conscious
of
my
presence
;
and
that
I
would
not
intrude
upon
her
in
any
way
without
his
sanction
.
<EOS>
I
use
some
other
argument
,
which
seem
perfectly
to
satisfy
him
,
and
we
separate
,
he
have
previously
acquaint
me
that
he
live
at
Tottenham
.
<EOS>
not
many
day
elapse
before
I
find
an
opportunity
of
view
his
daughter
,
and
I
find
her
exquisitely
beautiful
.
<EOS>
I
have
indeed
gain
a
prize
;
and
I
resolve
that
no
entreaty
on
his
part
,
or
on
her
,
should
induce
me
to
abandon
my
claim
.
<EOS>
I
take
care
not
to
be
see
by
her
,
be
sensible
that
any
impression
I
may
make
would
be
prejudicial
to
me
;
and
I
subsequently
learn
from
her
father
that
he
have
not
disclose
to
her
the
promise
he
have
be
rash
enough
to
make
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
an
interview
with
him
—
the
third
and
last
that
ever
take
place
between
us
—
on
the
morning
of
the
day
on
which
he
make
an
attempt
upon
the
life
of
the
King
.
<EOS>
I
ride
over
to
Tottenham
,
and
arrive
there
before
daybreak
.
<EOS>
My
coming
be
expect
,
and
he
himself
admit
me
by
a
private
door
into
his
garden
,
and
thence
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
perceive
that
his
mind
be
much
disturbed
,
and
he
tell
me
he
have
pass
the
whole
night
in
prayer
.
<EOS>
without
acquaint
me
with
his
desperate
design
,
I
gather
from
what
he
say
,
that
he
meditate
some
fearful
act
,
and
that
he
consider
his
own
life
in
great
jeopardy
.
<EOS>
if
he
fall
,
and
he
anticipate
he
should
fall
,
he
commit
his
daughter
to
my
care
;
and
he
give
me
a
write
injunction
,
wherein
,
as
you
will
find
,
his
blessing
be
bestow
upon
her
for
obedience
to
him
,
and
his
curse
lay
upon
her
in
the
event
of
a
breach
of
duty
;
command
her
,
by
all
her
hope
of
happiness
hereafter
,
to
fulfil
the
solemn
promise
he
have
make
me
—
provide
I
should
claim
her
hand
within
a
twelvemonth
of
his
death
.
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
man
,
as
you
know
,
die
within
two
day
of
that
interview
,
have
,
as
I
have
since
ascertain
,
reiterate
the
same
solemn
charge
,
and
in
term
equally
impressive
,
to
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
""a
<EOS>
strange
story
truly
,
"
observe
Sir
Francis
,
who
have
listen
attentively
to
the
relation
;
"
but
though
aveline
may
consent
to
be
bind
by
her
father
's
promise
to
you
,
<EOS>
I
see
not
how
lean
enforce
the
claim
.
<EOS>
""Hugh
<EOS>
Calveley
,
when
die
,
disclose
no
name
to
his
daughter
,
"
say
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"
there
be
no
name

in
the
paper
confide
by
him
to
Lanyere
;
and
,
possess
of
that
authority
,
you
will
represent
the
party

to
make
the
claim

and
can
act
as
Lanyere
would
have
act

<EOS>
""she
will
not
resist

demand

say
the
promoter
.
<EOS>
"
that
I
can
avouch
,
for
I
overhear

as
much
to
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
""if

such
be
the
case

the
old
usurer

to
Lanyere

<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
it
with

Francis

"
rejoin
the
promoter
;
"
but
Sir
Giles
will
explain
to
you
that
there
be
something
to
be
do
before
I
can
yield
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
""what
<EOS>
do
he
require
?
<EOS>
"
ask
the
old
usurer
,
glance
uneasily
at
his
partner
.
<EOS>
"merely
<EOS>
all
these
title
-
deed
of
the
Mounchensey
estate
in
exchange
for
that
paper
,
"
reply
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
merely
the
deed
,
"
say
Lanyere
;
"
but
an
assignment
on
your
part
,
Sir
Giles
,
and
on
yours
,
Sir
Francis
,
of
all
your
joint
interest
in
those
estate
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
them
absolutely
secure
to
me
;
and
stand
precisely
as
you
stand
towards
them
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
shall
have
all
you
require
,
"
reply
Mompesson
.
"amazement
!
<EOS>
"
exclaim
Sir
Francis
.
"
<EOS>
Can
you
really
mean
to
relinquish
this
noble
property
to
him
,
Sir
Giles
?
<EOS>
I
think
I
be
assign
my
share
to
you
,
and
little
dream
that
the
whole
estate
would
be
make
over
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
""I
have
tell
you
,
Sir
Francis
,
"
rejoin
the
other
,
"
that
vengeance
—
ample
,
refined
vengeance
—
cannot
be
too
dearly
purchase
;
and
you
will
now
perceive
that
I
be
willing
to
pay
as
extravagantly
as
yourself
for
the
gratification
of
a
whim
.
<EOS>
on
no
other
term
than
these
would
Lanyere
consent
to
part
with
the
authority
he
possess
,
which
while
it
will
ensure
you
the
hand
of
Aveline
,
will
ensure
me
the
keen
revenge
upon
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
I
have
therefore
accede
to
his
term
.
<EOS>
Thou
hast
get
a
rare
bargain
,
Lanyere
;

when
the

Puritan
give
thee

thee

exchange
would

indeed

seem
to
be

you
may
believe
me
when
I
say

that
though
I
gain
these
large

I
would
rather
have
have
the
damsel

<EOS>
""well

let
the
business
be
complete

"
say
Sir
Giles
;
"
and
that
it
may
be
so
with
all
dispatch

do
you

Lanyere

summon
Lupo
Vulp

<EOS>
You
will
find
him
in

him

with
him

deed
of

CHAPTER
XVI.Sir
Jocelyn
's
Rupture
with
de
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
far
and
wide
echo
the
report
of
Sir
Jocelyn
's
brilliant
achievement
at
the
joust
;
and
wherever
he
go
,
he
be
hail
as
vanquisher
of
the
hitherto
-
unconquere
Buckingham
.
<EOS>
He
bear
his
honour
meekly
,
yet
he
do
not
escape
calumny
;
for
at
a
court
,
as
everywhere
else
,
distinguished
success
be
certain
to
awaken
a
spirit
of
envy
and
detraction
.
<EOS>
these
paltry
feeling
,
however
,
be
entirely
confine
to
the
disappointed
of
his
own
sex
.
<EOS>
by
fair
and
more
impartial
judge
,
who
have
witness
his
exploit
,
he
be
speak
of
in
term
of
unmingled
admiration
;
and
at
the
grand
revel
at
Whitehall
that
follow
the
joust
,
many
a
soft
glance
tell
him
how
tenderly
the
gentle
heart
,
whose
feeling
it
betray
,
be
incline
towards
him
.
<EOS>
faithful
,
loyal
,
and
chivalrous
,
our
young
knight
be
as
much
proof
against
these
lur
,
as
against
the
ruder
attack
of
his
armed
opponent
in
the
list
;
and
his
constancy
to
the
lady
of
his
love
remain
entirely
unshaken
.
<EOS>
far
rather
would
he
have
be
with
Aveline
,
in
her
humble
dwelling
,
than
in
those
superb
festal
hall
,
surround
by
all
that
be
noble
and
beautiful
—
all
that
be
dangerous
and
delusive
.
<EOS>
far
rather
would
he
have
receive
one
smile
from
her
,
one
kindly
look
,
than
all
the
blandishment
shower
upon
him
by
these
enchantress
.
<EOS>
Fain
would
he
have
avoid
the
banquet
—
but
as
the
hero
of
the
day
,
he
be
compel
to
attend
it
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
he
have
to
enact
a
principal
part
at
the
revel
;
and
so
well
do
he
play
it
that
compliment
be
lavish
upon
him
,
enough
to
have
turn
an
ordinary
head
.
<EOS>
not
from
any
desire
for
ostentatious
display
,
but
because
Prince
Charles
have
signify
to
him
his
wish
on
the
subject
,
he
be
array
in
all
the
pearl
and
ornament
he
have
win
from
Buckingham
;
and
more
than
one
subtle
courtier
,
anxious
to
stand
well
with
him
,
flatteringly
declare
that
they
become
him
infinitely
better
than
the
Marquis
.
<EOS>
other
,
less
favourably
disposed
,
remark
that
his
gem
-
bedeck
doublet
be
like
the
garment
of
Nessus
,
and
would
cause
its
wearer
's
destruction
;
and
if
they
could
have
read
Buckingham
's
secret
thought
,
when
he
behold
his
rival
so
adorn
,
they
would
have
feel
that
the
observation
be
not
unwarranted
.
<EOS>
but
,
though
fully
determine
upon
revenge
,
Buckingham
allow
neither
look
nor
word
to
betray
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
on
the
contrary
,
he
display
more
than
his
usual
affability
to
Mounchensey
,
laugh
at
his
own
ill
-
luck
,
and
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
have
be
rightly
serve
;
add
,
that
he
blame
himself
for
include
him
in
his
party
,
and
be
glad
Sir
Jocelyn
have
handle
him
so
rudely
.
<EOS>
though
our
young
knight
may
well
doubt
Buckingham
's
sincerity
;
he
reply
to
all
his
courtly
speech
in
similar
term
,
and
the
great
cordiality
appear
to
subsist
between
them
.
<EOS>
enchant
with
this
show
of
friendship
,
the
King
endeavour
to
promote
it
by
keep
them
near
him
throughout
the
evening
,
lead
them
to
converse
together
,
and
fawn
upon
them
,
as
be
his
way
with
those
he
highly
favour
.
<EOS>
all
this
could
not
fail
to
be
satisfactory
to
Mounchensey
;
but
he
be
far
more
pleased
with
the
notice
of
Prince
Charles
,
who
treat
him
with
marked
consideration
.
<EOS>
next
morning
,
in
compliance
with
an
invitation
to
that
effect
he
have
receive
at
the
revel
,
Sir
Jocelyn
repair
to
Ely
House
,
in
Holborn
,
the
residence
of
the
Spanish
Ambassador
,
and
be
at
once
admit
to
his
presence
.
<EOS>
They
be
alone
,
and
after
a
few
preliminary
observation
upon
the
event
of
the
previous
day
,
De
Gondomar
remarked—"I
think
I
have
already
afford
you
abundant
proof
of
my
friendly
feeling
towards
you
,
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>

I
will
not
stop
with
what
I
have

<EOS>
My
power
of

great
than
you
may
imagine
it

<EOS>
I
can
lead
you
yet
high
—
and
put
you
in
a
firm
position

<EOS>
in
a
word
,
I
can
place
you
on
a
level
with
buckingham,—perchance
above
him,—if
your
ambition
soar
so
high
.
<EOS>
"Mounchensey
<EOS>
endeavour
to
express
his
deep
sense
of
gratitude
to
the
ambassador
,
and
regret
his
small
mean
of
requite
the
numerous
and
important
favour
he
have
receive
from
him
.
<EOS>
"I
will
tell
you
what
to
do
,
"
say
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
procure
me
certain
information
which
I
desire
to
obtain
.
<EOS>
by
my
instrumentality
you
have
,
in
some
degree
,
already
obtain
the
King
's
confidence
,
and
ere
long
be
sure
to
become
the
depositary
of
many
important
state
secret
.
<EOS>
these
you
shall
communicate
to
me
.
<EOS>
and
you
must
also
use
your
good
endeavour
to
win
Prince
Charles
over
to
the
Church
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
this
proposal
seriously
make
to
me
,
Count
?
<EOS>
"
demand
Mounchensey
,
look
at
him
with
astonishment
,
mingle
with
displeasure
.
<EOS>
"unquestionably
<EOS>
it
be
serious
—
perfectly
serious

"
reply
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
only
to
serve
me
as
a
certain
young
nobleman

your
acquaintance

me
before

to
fly
from
England
to
avoid
the
consequence
of
a
quarrel
with
his
wife
's
family

<EOS>
Your
opportunity
will
be
great
than
his

therefore
your
service
will
be
more
valuable

""i
<EOS>

disloyalty

charge

english
noble

say
Sir
Jocelyn
sternly
.
<EOS>
"

think
not

because
Lord
Roos
play
the
spy
and
traitor
,
as

Excellency
insinuate
he

that
I
will
be
guilty
of

up
to
this

have
feel
nothing

favour

but
especially
so
at
a
juncture
like
the
present
,
when
danger
menace
him
on
all
side
,
and
the
only
question
appear
to
be
,
from
what
side
the
first
blow
would
come
.
<EOS>
His
chief
anxiety
,
however
,
be
for
Aveline
,
whose
position
be
one
of
such
strange
and
imminent
peril
,
against
which
he
know
not
how
to
guard
her
.
<EOS>
He
be
still
leave
in
the
same
state
of
uncertainty
as
to
who
would
be
the
claimant
of
her
hand
;
for
the
mysterious
personage
in
the
mask
have
not
appear
again
,
accord
to
his
promise
,
after
the
joust
.
<EOS>
this
suspense
be
terrible
,
and
Sir
Jocelyn
find
it
so
difficult
of
endurance
,
that
he
would
have
prefer
the
actual
presence
of
the
calamity
by
which
he
be
threaten
.
<EOS>
His
fear
be
,
that
the
claim
he
so
much
dreaded
would
be
make
by
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
in
person
,
and
in
that
case
he
have
determine
forcibly
to
resist
him
.
<EOS>
and
this
supposition
may
account
for
the
delay
—
since
he
know
that
Sir
Giles
be
suffer
severely
from
the
effect
of
the
blow
he
have
deal
him
in
the
tilt
-
yard
.
<EOS>
De
Gondomar
's
be
not
idle
threat
,
as
Sir
Jocelyn
soon
find
.
<EOS>
on
the
next
day
,
as
he
enter
the
palace
,
he
be
inform
by
the
Lord
Chamberlain
that
he
be
deprive
of
his
office
of
Gentleman
of
the
Bed
-
Chamber
;
and
when
he
demand
the
reason
of
his
sudden
dismissal
,
the
Duke
of
Lennox
,
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulder
,
declare
he
be
unable
to
afford
him
any
information
.
<EOS>
but
what
the
Duke
refuse
be
afford
by
De
Gondomar
,
who
at
that
moment
enter
the
corridor
,
in
company
with
Buckingham
and
some
other
noble
,
on
his
way
to
the
presence
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
on
see
his
late
protégé
,
the
ambassador
halt
for
a
moment
,
and
with
a
smile
of
triumph
<EOS>
said—"You
owe
your
dismissal
to
me
,
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
I
have
make
some
few
circumstance
concern
you
that
have
just
come
to
my
ear
know
to
his
Majesty
;
and
as
he
do
not
choose
to
have
spy
about
his
person
,
he
have
release
you
from
all
further
attendance
upon
him
.
<EOS>
""in
<EOS>
a
word
,
he
have
forbid
your
attendance
again
at
the
palace
,
"
add
Buckingham
,
who
have
pause
likewise
,
with
an
insulting
laugh
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
must
to
the
King
,
your
grace
,
"
cry
Sir
Jocelyn
to
the
Lord
Chamberlain
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
explain
the
falsehood
of
this
charge
to
his
Majesty
,
and
show
him
who
be
the
spy
and
traitor
he
have
to
fear
.
<EOS>
""You
can
not
pass
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
"
say
the
Duke
of
Lennox
,
place
himself
in
his
way
,
while
two
halberdier
advance
to
bar
his
passage
with
their
partizan
.
<EOS>
"
I
say
not
a
word
as
to
the
cause
of
your
disgrace
;
but
I
may
tell
you
,
that
his
Majesty
be
greatly
offended
with
you
,
and
that
it
would
be
highly
imprudent
to
approach
him
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
,
even
be
it
permit
you
to
do
so
—
which
it
be
not
.
<EOS>
as
I
have
say
,
you
be
deprive
of
your
office
,
and
enjoin
to
absent
yourself
from
the
palace
,
till
it
shall
be
his
Majesty
's
pleasure
to
recall
you
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
that
be
not
likely
to
be
soon
the
case
—
eh
,
count
?
<EOS>
"
observe
Buckingham
,
with
a
laugh
.
"Not
<EOS>
very
likely
indeed
,
Marquis
,
"
say
the
ambassador
.
<EOS>
"
I
much
regret
that
I
have
be
the
mean
of
introduce
so
unworthy
a
person
to
his
Majesty
;
but
I
have
make
all
the
amend
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
""must
<EOS>
I
tamely
endure
all
these
insult
and
calumny
,
your
grace
?
"
cry
Sir
Jocelyn
furiously
.
<EOS>
"if
you
will
be
guide
by
me
,
you
will
retire
,
"
rejoin
the
Duke
of
Lennox
;
"
or
the
provocation
you
will
receive
may
induce
you
to
do
some
desperate
act
which
may
render
your
position
worse
,
and
put
your
restoration
to
the
King
's
favour
entirely
out
of
the
question
.
"While
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
be
debate
whether
he
should
comply
with
the
Duke
's
advice
,
the
door
of
the
presence
-
chamber
be
throw
open
;
and
James
,
come
forth
from
it
,
march
slowly
along
the
corridor
.
<EOS>
Our
young
knight
now
fondly
hope
that
the
King
may
deign
to
look
upon
him
,
and
so
enable
him
to
plead
his
cause
;
and
perhaps
the
Lord
Chamberlain
himself
entertain
similar
expectation
,
for
he
do
not
insist
upon
Sir
Jocelyn
's
withdrawal
,
but
allow
him
to
remain
within
the
corridor
,
though
he
be
keep
aloof
by
the
halberdier
.
<EOS>
but
both
be
disappointed
.
<EOS>
James
,
no
doubt
,
designedly
,
bestow
his
most
gracious
mark
of
condescension
on
Buckingham
and
De
Gondomar
,
and
linger
for
a
few
minute
to
laugh
and
talk
with
them
.
<EOS>
after
this
,
as
he
be
pass
Sir
Jocelyn
,
he
pretend
to
notice
him
for
the
first
time
,
and
observe
,
in
a
tone
of
reproof
to
the
Lord
Chamberlain
,
"
what
doth
the
spy
here
,
my
Lord
Duke
?
<EOS>
I
think
you
have
our
order
concern
him
.
<EOS>
see
they
be
better
obey
in
future
.
"
<EOS>
and
,
when
the
young
knight
would
have
speak
,
he
interrupt
him
by
an
imperious
gesture
,
cry
out
,
"
not
a

,
sir!—not

<EOS>
We
will

and

CHAPTER
<EOS>
XVIII.How
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
's
cause
be
espouse
by
the
'
prentice
.
<EOS>
stung
almost
to
madness
by
the
sense
of
intolerable
wrong
,
our
young
knight
quit
Whitehall
,
never
,
as
he
imagine
at
the
moment
,
to
enter
the
palace
again
.
<EOS>
yet
he
be
not
humiliate
by
his
disgrace
,
because
he
feel
it
to
be
wholly
unmerited
.
<EOS>
His
enemy
have
triumph
over
him
;
but
he
would
not
have
heed
the
defeat
,
provide
he
could
efface
the
foul
stigma
cast
upon
his
reputation
,
and
rebut
the
false
charge
bring
against
him
by
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
with
a
heart
overflow
with
rage
and
bitterness
,
and
with
a
thousand
wild
project
pass
through
his
brain
,
Sir
Jocelyn
take
a
boat
at
Whitehall
stair
,
and
order
the
waterman
to
row
down
the
river
,
without
assign
any
paticular
place
of
landing
.
<EOS>
after
awhile
,
he
succeed
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
in
control
his
angry
emotion
;
and
as
the
waterman
rest
on
their
oar
for
a
moment
,
to
inquire
his
destination
,
he
look
round
,
and
perceive
he
be
just
opposite
the
Three
Cranes
in
the
Vintry
,
he
desire
to
be
put
ashore
there
.
<EOS>
no
well
retreat
wherein
to
recover
his
composure
seem
to
offer
itself
than
Madame
Bonaventure
's
comfortable
house
of
entertainment
;
and
thither
,
therefore
,
he
proceed
,
and
at
his
request
be
show
into
a
private
room
overlook
the
river
.
<EOS>
scarcely
be
he
instal
within
it
,
than
the
buxom
hostess
,
who
have
catch
sight
of
him
as
he
mount
the
stair
,
enter
,
and
<EOS>
in
her
bland
accent
,
and
with
her
most
bewitching
smile
,
beg
to
know
his
command
;
declare
that
all
that
her
house
possess
be
at
his
service
.
<EOS>
She
be
run
on
thus
,
but
perceive
the
young
knight
to
be
much
disturb
,
she
instantly
change
her
tone
,
and
express
such
genuine
concern
for
him
,
that
he
could
not
fail
to
be
move
by
it
.
<EOS>
without
make
her
an
entire
confidante
,
Sir
Jocelyn
tell
her
enough
of
what
have
occur
to
make
her
comprehend
his
position
;
and
highly
indignant
she
be
at
the
treatment
he
have
experience
.
<EOS>
She
do
her
good
to
console
him
;
and
so
far
succeed
,
that
he
be
prevail
upon
to
partake
of
some
delicacy
which
she
cause
Cyprien
to
set
before
him
,
together
with
a
flask
of
the
good
vintage
in
her
cellar
;
and
the
discussion
of
these
good
thing
,
couple
with
the
hostess
's
assiduity
,
certainly
operate
as
a
balm
upon
his
wound
feeling
.
<EOS>
the
repast
over
,
the
good
-
natured
dame
think
it
best
to
leave
him
to
himself
;
and
draw
his
chair
to
the
open
window
,
he
begin
to
ruminate
upon
the
many
strange
event
that
have
happen
to
him
since
he
first
behold
that
fair
prospect
almost
from
the
same
place
;
and
he
be
indulge
in
this
retrospect
,
when
his
own
name
,
pronounce
in
tone
familiar
to
him
,
catch
his
ear
,
and
look
forth
,
he
perceive
Dick
Taverner
,
seat
on
a
bench
in
front
of
the
house
,
drink
in
company
with
some
half
dozen
other
apprentice
,
his
boon
companion
.
<EOS>
the
conversation
of
these
roysterer
be
hold
in
so
loud
a
key
that
it
could
not
fail
to
reach
his
ear
;
and
he
soon
ascertain
that
his
own
dismissal
from
court
be
the
theme
of
their
discourse
,
and
that
they
rightly
attribute
it
—
doubtless
owe
to
information
derive
from
their
hostess
—
to
the
instrumentality
of
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
It
be
evidently
Dick
Taverner
's
design
to
rouse
the
indignation
of
his
companion
;
and
he
have
little
difficulty
in
accomplish
his
purpose
,
as
they
be
all
compose
of
very
inflammable
material
,
and
prone
to
take
fire
on
the
slight
application
of
the
match
.
<EOS>
Dick
denounce
the
plotting
and
perfidious
Spaniard
as
a
traitor
to
the
King
and
a
subverter
of
the
protestant
faith
;
and
counsel
vengeance
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Finding
Dick
's
suggestion
eagerly
catch
up
by
his
companion
,
and
that
the
number
of
his
listener
be
momently
increase
,
while
all
be
become
excited
by
what
the
orator
utter
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
apprehensive
that
mischief
may
ensue
,
think
it
right
to
interfere
,
and
accordingly
,
lean
forward
from
the
casement
,
he
make
himself
known
to
the
group
below
.
<EOS>
on
see
him
,
and
learn
who
he
be
,
the
'
prentice
begin
to
shout
and
declaim
vehemently
against
the
spanish
ambassador
;
and
instigate
by
Dick
Taverner
,
who
refuse
to
listen
either
to
the
entreaty
or
command
of
the
young
knight
,
the
whole
party
seize
their
cudgel
,
and
disperse
themselves
in
different
direction
,
vociferate
as
they
went—"clubs
!
<EOS>
clubs!"It
be
now
as
vain
to
arrest
them
as
it
would
have
be
to
stop
the
course
of
a
conflagration
;
and
Sir
Jocelyn
be
deplore
the
damage
which
must
necessarily
be
do
to
his
cause
by
these
injudicious
friend
,
when
Dick
Taverner
,
with
a
look
of
exultation
,
and
brandish
his
cudgel
,
burst
into
the
room
,
crying—"We
have
hear
all
from
Madame
Bonaventure
.
<EOS>
We
have
hear
of
De
Gondomar
's
perfidy
,
and
his
Majesty
's
injustice
.
<EOS>
We
will
set
you
right
.
<EOS>
the
bold
London
'
prentice

take
your
cause
in
hand
,
and
will
avenge
you
.
<EOS>
They
will
hang
the
treacherous
Spaniard
,
and
burn
his
house
.
<EOS>
""Hark
<EOS>
ye
,
my
good
friend
,
Dick
Taverner
<EOS>
,
"
say
Sir
Jocelyn
,
"
this
must
not
be
.
<EOS>
because
I
have
be
unjustly
treat
,
and
may
perchance
find
it
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
to
obtain
redress
,

not

that
you

your

be
to
violate
the
law

<EOS>
these
riotous
proceeding
will
prejudice
my
cause
rather
than
aid
it
;
and
if
you
have
any
regard
for
me
you
will
use
your
influence
with
your
comrade
to
check
them
ere
mischief
ensue

""impossible

"
exclaim
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
the
matter
have
go
too
far
to
be
stop
now

<EOS>
You
may
as
well
attempt
to
turn
back
a
mill

dam

have
burst
its
bound

as
the
headstrong
London
'
prentice
when
they
have

up
their
cudgel

through
with
the
business

<EOS>
this
be
not
the
only
quarrel
we
have
with
De
Gondomar

<EOS>
We
hate
him
for
his
insolence
and
arrogance
,
which
have
be
often
display
towards
us
;
We
hate
him
because
he

not

with
the
affair

leave
its
arrangement
to
us

""But

I
must
interfere

cry
Sir
Jocelyn
;
"
if
you
act
thus
,
in
spite

all

the

I

loudly
enough

reserve

,
in

he
have
something
of
the
look
of
a
jailor

and
this
notion
be
strengthen
when
he
find
himself
lock
in
his
room

<EOS>
probably
this
be
only
do
as
a
precautionary
measure
by

<EOS>
as

approach
the

a
heavy
presentiment
of
ill
seized
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
the
place
seem
to
have
lose
its
customary
smiling
air
.
<EOS>
no
fair
countenance
beam
upon
him
from
the
casement
;
no
light
footstep
be
hear
hasten
to
the
door
;
no
one
open
it
to
give
him
welcome
.
<EOS>
Could
aveline
have
fled'?—or
have
some
dire
misfortune
happen
to
her
.
<EOS>
suspense
be
bad
than
certainty
of
ill
:
and
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
he
raise
the
latch
,
and
with
tremble
footstep
cross
the
threshold
.
<EOS>
She
be
go
—
he
could
no
longer
doubt
it
.
<EOS>
the
disorder
appearance
of
the
chamber
in
which
he
find
himself
,
with
its
furniture
scatter
about
,
seem
to
tell
of
a
struggle
,
and
a
forcible
abduction
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
though
expect
no
answer

he
call
forth
her
name
in
accent
of
wildest
despair

She
come

<EOS>
all
be
go

<EOS>
the

be
indeed
desolate

<EOS>
still
cling
to
hope
,
he
fly
up
-
stair
,
but
could
find
no
trace
there
of
any
of
the
inmate
of
the
dwelling
;
and
with
a
heart
now
completely
crush
,
he
descend
to
the
chamber
he
have
just
quit
.
<EOS>
here
he
find
Clement
Lanyere
survey
the
scene
of
confusion
around
him
with
a
stern
and
troubled
look
.
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
instantly
rush
up
to
him
,
and
seize
him
by
the
arm

fiercely
demand
what
have
become
of
Aveline?"She

reply
the

""Though

return
the

<EOS>
"
but
perhaps
you
be
right

Aveline

resistance
may
intimidate
them
both
so
that

may
abandon

design

<EOS>
I
hope
so

house
standing
near
the
River
Fleet
as
early
as
the

of
Richard

of
the
old
jail
in
London
,

Nathaniel

,
and
Robert

in

a
fine
of
sixty
mark
for
its
custody
;
affirm
"
that
it
have
be
their
inheritance
ever
since
the
Conquest

and
pray
that
they
may
not
be
hinder
therein
by

counter

fine
of
Osbert

"
to
whom
it

<EOS>
the

warden
of
the
Fleet
,
in
the
day
of
John
,
be
Simon
Fitz
-
Robert
,
Archdeacon
of
wells,—probably
a
near
relative
of
Robert

the

upward
of
three
century

until
,
in
the
reign
of
Philip
and
Mary
it
be
,
sell
to
John
Heath
for
£
2300—a
large
sum
in
those
day
,
but
not
more
than
the
value
of
the
property
,
which
from
the
way
it
be
manage
produce
a
large
revenue
to
its
possessor
.
<EOS>
the
joint
warden
of
the
Fleet
at
the
time
of
our
history
be
<EOS>
Sir
Henry
Lello
and
John
Eldred
;
but
their
office
be
execute
by
deputy
in
the
person
of
Joachim
Tunstall
,
by
whom
it
be
rent

<EOS>
as
will
naturally
be
suppose
,
it
be
the
object
of
every
deputy
-
warden
to
make
as
much
as
he
could
out
of
the
unfortunate
individual
commit
to
his
charge
;
and
some
idea
of
the
infamous
practice
of
those
person
may
be
gather
,
from
a
petition
present
to
the
Lords
of
the
Council
in
1586
by
the
then
prisoner
of
the
Fleet

<EOS>
in
this
it
be
state
that

to
farm
the
victualling

lodging
of
all
the
house

one
John
Harvey

<EOS>
Fleet
he
have
let
to
one
Thomas
Newport

the
deputy
there
under
the

and
these
be
very
poor
man
,
have
neither
land
nor
any
trade
to
live
by
,
nor
any
certain
wage
of
the
say
warden
,
and
be
also
greedy
of
gain
,
do
live
by
bribing
and
extortion
.
<EOS>
that
they
do
most
shamefully
extort
and
exact
from
the
prisoner
,
raise
new
custom
,
fine
,
and
payment
,
for
their
own
advantage
.
<EOS>
that
they
cruelly
use
them
,
shut
them
up
in
close
prison
when
they
find
fault
with
their
wicked
dealing
;
not
suffer
them
to
come
and
go
as
they
ought
to
do
;
with
other
abominable
misdemeanour
,
which
,
without
reformation
,
may
be
the
poor
prisoner
'
utter
undoing
.
<EOS>
"in
<EOS>
consequence
of
this
petition

a
commission
of
inquiry
into
the

for
only
seven

<EOS>
still
no
redress
be
obtain

it
would

when
the
cry
of
the
victim

this
abominable
system

oppression

so
easily

<EOS>
the
most
arbitrary
measure
be
resort
to
by
the
officer
of
the

carry
out
with
perfect

Their

<EOS>
the
moral
condition

frightful

<EOS>
as
the
great
portion
of
them
consist

vicious

disorderly
character

the
state

in

Fleet
Prison
at

period

our
history
,
when
its
misgovernment

great
than
it

and
the
condition

its
inmate
incomparably
bad

great
part

and
otherwise

when

the
jail

strengthen
and
considerably

<EOS>
Its
wall
be
of
stone
,
now
grim
and
hoary
with
age
;
and
on
the
side
next
to
the
Fleet
there
be
a
large
square
structure
,
resemble
Traitor

Gate
at

to
this
gate

water
after
committal
by
the
Council
of
the
Star
-
Chamber

<EOS>
nothing
could
be
sterner
or
gloomy
than
the
aspect
of
the
prison
on
this
side
—
gray
and
frown
wall
,
with
a
few
sombre
building
peep
above
them
,
and
a
black
gateway
,
with
a
yawning
arch

it

through
a
wicket

ponderous
door

a
second
gate

and
this
bring
the
captive
to
the
porter

lodge
,
where
he
be
deliver
up
to
the
jailer
,
and
assign
a
room
in
one
of
the
ward
,
accord
to
his
mean
of
pay
for
it
.
<EOS>
the
good
of
these
lodging
be
but
indifferent
;
and
the
bad
be
abominable
and
noisome
pit
.
<EOS>
on
enter
the
outer
ward
,
a
strange
scene
present
itself
to
the
view
.
<EOS>
Motley
group
be
scatter
about
—
most
of
the
person
compose
them
be
clothe
in
threadbare
doublet
and
tattered
cloak
,
and
wear
cap
,
from
which
the
feather
and
ornament
have
long
since
disappear
;
but
there
be
a
few
—
probably
new
coiner
—
in
somewhat
well
attire
.
<EOS>
all
these
wear
debtor
.
<EOS>
recklessness
and
effrontery
be
display
in
their
countenance
,
and
their
discourse
be
full
of
ribaldry
and
profanity
.
<EOS>
at
one
side
of
this
ward
there
be
a
large
kitchen
,
where
eat
and
drinking
be
constantly
go
forward
at
little
table
,
as
at
a
tavern
or
cookshop
,
and
where
common
be
serve
out
to
the
poor
prisoner
.
<EOS>
near
this
be
a
large
hall
,
which
serve
as
the
refectory
of
the
prisoner
for
debt

<EOS>
It

side
bench
of
oak

and
have
two

table
of
the
same
wood
;
but
both
bench
and
table
be
in
a
filthy
state
,
and
the
floor
be
never
cleanse
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
every
part
of
the
prison
be
foul
enough
to
breed
a
pestilence
;
and
the
place
be
seldom
free
from
fever
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
the
upper
part
of
the
refectory
be
traverse
by
a
long
corridor
,
on
either
side
of
which
be
the
dormitory
.
<EOS>
the
arrangement
of
the
inner
ward
be
nearly
similar
,
and
differ
only
from
the
outer
,
in
so
far
that
the
accommodation
be
superior

as
they
have
nee
to
be
,
consider
the
price

for
them
;
but
even
here
nothing
like
cleanliness
could
be
find
.

this

<EOS>
at
a
grate

in

and
endeavour
by
their
cry

which

the
deputy

Joachim
Tunstall
,
be
a
range
of
subterranean
dungeon
,
build
below
the
level
of
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
frequently
flood
by
the
river
,
these
dungeon
be
exceedingly
damp
and
unwholesome
;
and
they
be
reserve
for
such
prisoner
as
have
incur
the
censure
of
the
inexorable
Court
of
Star
-
Chamber
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
one
of
the
deep
and
most
dismal
of
these
cell
that
the
unfortunate
Sir
Ferdinando
Mounchensey
breathe
his
last
.
<EOS>
allusion
have
be
previously
make
to
the
influence
exercise
within
the
Fleet
by
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
both
the
warden
be
his
friend
,
and
ever
ready
to
serve
him
;
their
deputy
be
his
creature
,
and
subservient
to
his
will
in
all
thing
;
while
the
jailer
and
their
assistant
take
his
order
,
whatever
they
may
be
,
as
if
from
a
master
.
<EOS>
thus
he
be
enable
to
tyrannize
over
the
object
of
his
displeasure
,
who
could
never
be
secure
from
his
malice
.
<EOS>
by
the
mode
of
torture
he
adopt
through
his
agent
,
he
could
break
the
most
stubborn
spirit
,
and
subdue
the
strong
.
<EOS>
It
be
matter
of
savage
satisfaction
to
him
to
witness
the
suffering
of
his
victim
;
and
he
never
cease
from
persecution
till
he
have
obtain
whatever
he
desire
.
<EOS>
the
barbarity
carry
out
in
pursuance
of
the
atrocious
sentence
of
the
Court
of
Star
-
Chamber
be
to
him
pleasant
spectacle
;
and
the
bleeding
and
mutilate
wretch
,
whom
his
accusation
have
conduct
to
the
pillory
,
when
bring
back
to
their
dungeon
,
could
not
escape
his
hateful
presence

bad

from

fiendish

CHAPTER
XXIII.How
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
be
bring
to
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
after
his
arrest
by
the
serjeant
-
at

Sir
Jocelyn

in
the
first
instance
,
to
the

Chamber
,
where
some
of
the
Lords
of
the
Council

at
the
time
,
and
examine
respect
the
"
libellous
language
and
false
scandal
"
he
have
use
in
reference
to
the
proceeding
of
that
high
and
honourable
court
.
<EOS>
the
young
knight
do
not
attempt
to
deny
the
truth
of
the
charge
bring
against
him
,
neither
do
he
express
contrition
,
or
sue
for
forgiveness
;
but
though
he
demand
to
be
confront
with
his
accuser
,
the
request
be
refuse
him
;
and
he
be
tell
they
would
appear
in
due
time
.
<EOS>
several
interrogatory
be
then
address
to
him
,
which
he
answer
in
a
manner
calculate
,
in
the
judgment
of
his
hearer
,
to
aggravate
the
original
offence
.
<EOS>
after
this
,
he
be
require
to
subscribe
the
minute
of
his
confession
,
as
it
be
style
;
and
a
warant
for
his
committal
to
the
Fleet
Prison
,
and
close
confinement
within
it
,
be
make
out
.
<EOS>
consign
once
more
to
the
custody
of
the
serjeant
-
at
-
arm
,
he
be
place
on
board
a
barge
,
of
ill
-
omened
appearance
,
be
cover
with
black
cloth
,
like
a
venetian
gondola
,
and
keep
for
offender
against
the
Star
-
Chamber
.
<EOS>
in
this
he
be
row
down
the
Thames
,
and
up
the
Fleet
,
to
the
entrance
of
the
prison
.
<EOS>
the
progress
of
the
well
-
know
sable
barge
up
the
narrow
river
have
be
note
by
the
passenger
along
its
bank
,
as
well
as
by
those
cross
Fleet
Bridge
,
some
curiosity
be
feel
to
ascertain
whom
it
contain
;
and
a
crowd
collect
in
front
of
the
prison
gate
to
witness
the
disembarkation
.
<EOS>
when
the
young
knight
's
title
,
and
the
nature
of
his
offence
,
which
latter
do
not
appear
so
enormous
in
their
eye
as
in
those
of
the
Lords
of
the
Council
,
become
know
to
the
bystander
,
much
sympathy
be
express
for
him
;
and
it
may
have
find
a
manifestation
in
more
than
word
,
but
for
the
guard
,
who
keep
back
the
throng
.
<EOS>
at
this
juncture
,
Sir
Jocelyn
hear
his
own
name
pronounce
in
familiar
tone
,
and
look
round
for
the
speaker
,
perceive
a
person
place
in
a
tub
close
beside
him
.
<EOS>
the
individual
who
occupy
this
singular
and
degrade
position
be
the
ill
-
star
Dick
Taverner
,
who
,
it
appear
,
have
make
an
attempt
to
escape
from
prison
on
the
third
day
after
he
have
be
bring
thither
,
and
be
punish
,
accord
to
the
custom
of
the
place
,
by
be
bind
hand
and
foot
,
set
within
a
tub
,
and
expose
to
public
gaze
and
derision
.
<EOS>
"Alas
!
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
!
<EOS>
"
ejaculate
the
apprentice
,
"
but
for
you
I
should
not
have
be
here
.
<EOS>
I
undertake
a
thankless
office
,
and
have
be
rightly
serve
for
my
folly
.
<EOS>
We
have
both
find
our
way
to
the
Fleet
,
but
I
much
doubt
if
either
of
us
will
find
his
way
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
I
like
the
appearance
of
the
place
,
and
the
society
it
seem
to
furnish
,
so
little
,
that
I
resolve
to
make
a
clearance
of
it
at
once
;
and
accordingly
I
manage
to
scramble
up
yonder
lofty
wall
,
in
the
hope
of
effect
my
deliverance
,
without
ask
for
a
licence
to
go
abroad
from
the
warden
;
but
,
unfortunately
,
in
drop
down
from
so
great
a
height
<EOS>
I
sprain
my
ankle
,
and
fall
again
into
the
hand
of
the
Philistines
—
and
here
I
be
,
like
the
cynic
philosopher
in
his
tub
.
<EOS>
"Sir
<EOS>
Jocelyn
would
have
address
a
few
word
of
consolation
to
the
poor
fellow
,
but
at
this
moment
the
wicket
be
open
,
and
he
be
push
through
it
by
the
attendant
of
the
serjeant
-
at

arm
,
who
be
apprehensive
of
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
the
small
aperture
that
have
give
him
admittance
to
the
prison
be
instantly
close
,
and
all
chance
of
rescue
cut
off
.
<EOS>
the
prisoner
be
thus
effectually
secure

the

more
easy

at

from
his
personal
strength
and
the
savageness
of
his
disposition

<EOS>
with
a
growl
like
that
of
a
mastiff

to
the
black
broad
muzzle
of
which
animal
<EOS>
his
own

bear
a
remarkable

the
new

them
into
an
apartment
build
of
stone
,
octagonal
in
shape
,
with
a
vaulted
roof
,
narrow
window
like
loophole
,
and
a
great
stone
fireplace
.
<EOS>
Its
wall
,
which
resemble
those
of
an
ancient
guardroom
,
be
appropriately
enough
garnish
with
fetter
;
mix
up
with
which

with
a
bald

in
spite
of
his

His

<EOS>
how
judgment
be
give
by
King
Jamesin
the
Star
Chamber
,
in
the
great
cause
of
thecountess
of
Exeter
against
Sir
Thomas
and
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
five
day
have
King
James
and
the
whole
of
the
Privy
Council
be
sit
within
the
Star
-
Chamber
;
and
the
great
cause
that
have
occupy
them
during
the
whole
of
that
time
be
draw
to
an
end
—
little
remain
for
his
Majesty
to
do
in
it
,
except
to
pronounce
sentence
.
<EOS>
the
cause
to
which
James
and
his
Councillors
have
lend
a
hearing
so
long
and
patient
,
be
no
other
than
that
of
the
Countess
of
Exeter
against
Sir
Thomas
Lake
and
his
Lady
.
<EOS>
throughout
it
,
whether
prompt
or
not
as
to
the
course
he
pursue
,
the
Monarch
display
great
sagacity
and
penetration
.
<EOS>
prior
to
the
trial
,
and
when
the
preliminary
statement
have
alone
be
lay
before
him
,
he
determine
personally
to
investigate
the
matter
,
and
without
acquaint
any
one
with
his
design
,
while
out
hunting
,
he
ride
over
to
the
Earl
of
Exeter
's
residence
at
Wimbledon
—
the
place
,
it
will
be
recollect
,
where
the
forge
confession
be
allege
to
have
be
sign
by
the
Countess
—
and
proceed
to
examine
the
particular
chamber
indicate
by
Lady
Lake
and
Sarah
Swarton
as
the
scene
of
the
transaction
.
<EOS>
He
be
accompany
by
Buckingham
,
and
some
other
lord
high
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
on
examination
it
be
find
that
the
chamber
be
of
such
size
,
and
the
low
part
of
it
,
where
Sarah
be
report
to
have
be
conceal
,
be
so
distant
from
the
large
bay
window
,
that
any
conversation
hold
there
must
have
be
inaudible
to
her
;
as
be
prove
,
upon
experiment
,
by
the
King
and
his
attendant
.
<EOS>
but
the
crowning
circumstance
be
the
discovery
make
by
James
himself
—
for
his
courtier
be
too
discreet
to
claim
any
share
in
it
—
that
the
hanging
do
not
reach
within
two
foot
of
the
floor
,
and
consequently
could
not
have
screen
a
secret
witness
from
view
;
while
it
be
further
ascertain
that
the
arra
have
be
entirely
undisturbed
for
several
year
.
<EOS>
on
make
this
discovery
,
James
rub
his
hand
with
great
glee
,
and
exclaimed—"Aha
!
<EOS>
my
Lady
Lake
and
her
handmaiden
may
forswear
themselves
if
they
choose
—
but
they
will
not
convince
me
.
<EOS>
oath
can
not
confound
my
sight
.
<EOS>
"This
asseveration
he
repeat
during
the
trial
,
at
which
he
proffer
his
own
testimony
in
favour
of
the
plaintiff
;
and
indeed
it
be
evident
from
the
first
,
however
much
he
may
seek
to
disguise
it
,
that
he
be
strongly
biassed
towards
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
not
content
,
however
,
with
the
discovery
he
have
make
at
Wimbledon
,
James
have
secretly
despatch
a
serjeant
-
at
-
arm
to
Rome
,
where
Lord
Roos
have
take
up
his
residence
after
leave
England
,
and
obtain
from
him
and
from
his
confidential
servant
Diego
,
a
statement
incriminate
Lady
Lake
,
and
denounce
the
confession
as
a
wicked
forgery
.
<EOS>
Luke
Hatton
,
moreover
,
who
have
go
over
,
as
already
intimate
,
to
the
side
of
the
Countess
,
and
who
take
care
to
hide
his
own
complicity
in
the
dark
affair
,
and
to
give
a
very
different
colour
to
his
conduct
from
what
really
belong
to
it
—
Luke
Hatton
,
we
say
,
become
a
most
important
witness
against
the
Lakes
,
and
it
be
say
to
be
owe
to
his
crafty
insinuation
that
the
King
conceive
the
idea
of
visit
Wimbledon
as
before
-
mention
.
<EOS>
notwithstanding
all
this
,
there
be
many
irreconcileable
contradiction
,
and
the
notoriously
bad
character
of
Lord
Roos
,
his
cruel
treatment
of
his
wife
,
and
his
passionate
devotion
to
the
Countess
,
lead
many
to
suspect
that
,
after
all
,
he
and
Lady
Exeter
be
the
guilty
party
they
be
represent
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
by
such
as
have
any
knowledge
of
the
man
,
Luke
Hatton
be
not
esteem
a
credible
witness
;
and
it
be
generally
think
that
his
testimony
ought
not
to
be
receive
by
the
King
,
or
accept
only
with
the
great
caution
.
<EOS>
but
the
opinion
favourable
to
Lady
Lake
and
her
husband
undergo
an
entire
change
in
the
early
part
of
the
trial
,
when
,
to
the
surprise
of
all
,
and
to
the
inexpressible
dismay
of
her
parent
,
Lady
Roos
,
who
have
be
include
in
the
process
by
the
Countess
,
make
a
confession
,
wherein
she
admit
that
the
document
produce
by
her
mother
against
Lady
Exeter
,
be
fabricate
,
and
that
all
the
circumstance
say
to
be
connect
with
it
at
the
time
of
its
supposed
signature
,
be
groundless
and
imaginary
.
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
lady
's
motive
for
make
this
revelation
be
the
desire
of
screen
her
husband
;
and
so
infatuated
<EOS>
be
she
by
her
love
of
him
,
that
she
allow
herself
to
be
persuade
—
by
the
artful
suggestion
,
it
be
whisper
,
of
Luke
Hatton
—
that
this
would
be
the
mean
of
accomplish
their
reconciliation
,
and
that
she
would
be
reward
for
her
devotion
by
his
return
regard
.
<EOS>
if
such
be
her
belief
,
she
be
doom
to
disappointment
.
<EOS>
She
never
beheld
him
again
.
<EOS>
Lord
Roos
die
abroad
soon
after
the
trial
take
place
;
nor
do
his
ill
-
fate
lady
long
survive
him
.
<EOS>
thus
,
it
will
be
see
,
all
circumstance
be
adverse
to
the
Lakes
.
<EOS>
but
in
spite
of
the
difficulty
surround
her
,
and
the
weight
of
evidence
,
true
or
false
,
bring
against
her
,
no
concession
could
be
obtain
from
Lady
Lake
,
and
she
stoutly
protest
her
innocence
,
and
retaliate
in
most
forcible
term
upon
her
accuser
.
<EOS>
She
give
a
flat
contradiction
to
her
daughter
,
and
pour
terrible
malediction
on
her
head
,
cease
them
not
until
silence
by
command
of
the
King
.
<EOS>
the
fearful
charge
bring
by
her
ladyship
against
Luke
Hatton
produce
some
effect
,
and
be
listen
to
;
but
,
as
they
could
only
be
substantiate
by
herself
and
Sarah
Swarton
,
they
fall
to
the
ground
;
since
here
again
Lady
Roos
refuse
to
be
a
witness
against
her
husband
.
<EOS>
unwilling
to
admit
his
wife
's
criminality
,
though
urge
by
the
King
to
do
so
in
order
to
save
himself
,
Sir
Thomas
Lake
be
unable
to
make
a
successful
defence
;
and
he
seem
so
much
bow
down
by
affliction
and
perplexity
,
that
sympathy
be
generally
feel
for
him
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
his
dignified
deportment
and
reserve
give
him
some
claim
to
consideration
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
be
the
trial
bring
to
a
close
,
after
three
day
'
duration
.
<EOS>
now
,
let
a
glance
be
cast
round
the
room
wherein
the
lord
of
the
Council
be
deliberate
upon
their
judgment
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
Star
-
Chamber
.
<EOS>
situate
on
the
south
-
eastern
side
of
Westminster
Hall
,
near
the
river
,
this
famous
room,—wherein
the
secret
council
of
the
kingdom
be
then
hold
,
and
have
be
hold
during
many
previous
reigns,—was
more
remarkable
for
the
beauty
of
its
ceiling
than
for
size
or
splendour
.
<EOS>
that
ceiling
be
of
oak
,
richly
carve
and
gilt
,
and
dispose
in
square
,
in
the
midst
of
which
be
rose
,
portculise
,
pomegranate
,
and
fleur
-
de
-
lys
.
<EOS>
over
the
door
lead
to
the
chamber
be
place
a
star
,
in
allusion
to
its
name
,
with
the
date
1602
.
<EOS>
Its
wall
be
cover
with
ancient
tapestry
,
and
it
have
many
window
look
towards
the
river
,
and
fill
with
paint
glass
.
<EOS>
though
it
would
appear
to
be
obvious
enough
,
much
doubt
have
be
entertain
as
to
the
derivation
of
the
name
of
this
celebrate
Court
.
<EOS>
"
some
think
it
so
call
,
"
write
the
author
of
a
learned
treatise
on
its
jurisdiction
,
before
cite
,
"
of
Crimen
Stellionatus
,
because
it
handleth
such
thing
and
case
as
be
strange
and
unusual
:
some
of
Stallen
.
<EOS>
I
confess
I
be
in
that
point
a
Platonist
in
opinion
,
that
nomina
naturâ
fiunt
potiùs
quam
vagâ
impositone
.
<EOS>
and
so
I
doubt
not
<EOS>
but
Camera
-
Stellata
(
for
so
I
find
it
call
in
our
ancient
year
-
book
)
be
most
aptly
name
;
not
because
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
where
the
Court
be
keep
,
be
so
adorn
with
star
gild
,
as
some
would
have
it
—
for
surely
the
chamber
be
so
adorn
because
it
be
the
seal
of
that
Court
,
et
denominatio
,
be
à
praestantiori
magis
dignum
trahit
ad
se
minus
;
and
it
be
so
fitly
call
,
because
the
star
have
no
light
but
what
be
cast
upon
them
from
the
sun
by
reflection
,
be
his
representative
body
,
and
,
as
his
Majesty
be
pleased
to
say
when
he
sit
there
in
his
royal
person
,
representation
must
need
cease
when
the
person
be
present
.
<EOS>
so
in
the
presence
of
his
great
majesty
,
the
which
be
the
sun
of
honour
and
glory
,
the
shining
of
those
star
be
put
out
,
they
not
have
any
power
to
pronounce
any
sentence
in
this
Court
—
for
the
judgment
be
the
King
's
only
;
but
by
way
of
advice
they
deliver
their
opinion
,
which
his
wisdom
alloweth
or
disalloweth
,
increaseth
or
moderateth
at
his
royal
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
explanation
,
which
seem
rather
give
for
the
purpose
of
pay
a
fulsome
compliment
to
James
,
in
whose
reign
the
treatise
in
question
be
write
,
be
scarcely
satisfactory
;
and
we
have
little
doubt
that
the
name
originate
in
the
circumstance
of
the
roof
of
the
chamber
be
embellish
with
gilded
star
.
<EOS>
We
be
tell
in
Strype
's
Stowe
,
that
the
Star
-
Chamber
be
"
so
call
,
either
by
derivation
from
the
old
english
word
Steoran
,
which
signifieth
to
steer
or
rule
,
as
doth
the
pilot
of
a
ship
;
because
the
King
and
Council
do
sit
here
,
as
it
be
,
at
the
stern
,
and
do
govern
in
the
ship
of
the
Commonwealth
.
<EOS>
some
derive
in
from
Stellio
,
which
signify
that
starry
and
subtle
beast
so
call

ye

""Excellent

""Anither

return
James

a
few
word
be
exchange

them

and
,
the
information
gain
by
the
individual

perfectly
satisfactory

the
injury
he
have

during
his
struggle
with
Sir
Giles
Mompesson

so
that
there
be
no
obstacle
to
his
removal

his
natural

such
cogent
reason

be
about
to
be
act
upon
in
the
next
day
for
the
punishment
of
his
enemy

and
it
then
become
evident
why
Sir
Giles
should
not

make
acquainted
with
his
release
,
which
must
be
the
case

XXIXThe
Silver
Coffer
.
<EOS>
within
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
's
vast
and
gloomy
mansion
,
it
have
be
say
there
be
certain
room
which
,
from
their
size
and
splendour
,
form
a
striking
contrast
to
the
rest
of
the
habitation
.
<EOS>
never
used,—except
on
extraordinary
occasion
,
when
their
owner
give
a
grand
entertainment
with
some
ulterior
object,—these
apartment
,
notwithstanding
their
magnificence
,
partook
in
some
degree
of
the
chilling
and
inhospitable
character
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
even
when
brilliantly
light
up
,
they
want
warmth
and
comfort
;
and
though
the
banquet
give
within
them
be
sumptuous
and
profuse
,
and
the
wine
flow
without
stint
,
the
guest
go
away
dissatisfied
,
and
rail
against
their
ostentatious
host
.
<EOS>
thus
,
though
the
stone
wall
be
hang
with
rich
tapestry
,
the
dust
have
gather
thickly
upon
its
fold
,
while
portion
of
the
rugged
masonry
be
reveal
to
view
.
<EOS>
the
furniture
be
massive
,
but
cumbrous
and
ill
-
assorted
;
and
the
gild
ceiling
and
venetian
mirror
,
from
want
of
care
,
have
become
tarnished
and
dim
.
<EOS>
such
as
they
be
,
however
,
these
apartment
be
assign
to
Aveline
,
when
she
be
forcibly
bring
to
the
extortioner
's
habitation
,
as
before
narrate
.
<EOS>
allow
to
range
within
them
at
pleasure
,
she
be
keep
strictly
within
their
limit
.
<EOS>
the
door
be
constantly
guard
by
one
or
other
of
the
myrmidon
;
and
any
communication
with
the
external
world
be
impossible
,
because
the
window
be
partially
grate
,
and
look
into
a
court
-
yard
.
<EOS>
beyond
this
,
she
be
subject
to
no
restraint
;
and
her
own
attendant
,
Dame
Sherborne
and
old
Anthony
Rocke
,
be
suffer
to
remain
with
her
.
<EOS>
have
it
not
be
for
her
exposure
to
the
annoyance
of
frequent
from
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
,
and
her
anxiety
about
Sir
Jocelyn
<EOS>
,
Aveline
would
not
have
find
her
confinement
so
intolerable
.
<EOS>
but
the
enamoured
old
usurer
persecute
her
at
all
hour
,
and
she
could
never
be
free
from
the
intrusion
,
since
the
door
could
not
be
shut
against
him
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
he
come
accompany
by
his
partner
,
though
more
frequently
alone
,
but
ever
with
the
same
purpose,—namely
,
that
of
protest
the
violence
of
his
passion
,
and
seek
to
soften
her
obduracy
.
<EOS>
as
may
be
well
suppose
,
his
pleading
,
however
urge
,
be
wholly
ineffectual
,
and
excited
no
other
feeling
,
except
those
of
detestation
,
in
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
such
a
state
of
thing
could
not
endure
for
ever
;
and
her
only
hope
be
,
that
find
all
his
effort
to
move
her
fruitless
,
he
would
in
time
desist
from
them
.
<EOS>
not
that
she
be
without
other
fearful
apprehension
,
which
be
share
by
her
attendant
.
<EOS>
nearly
a
fortnight
have
thus
pass
by
,
when
,
one
day
,
during
which
she
have
see
nothing
of
her
tormentor
,
and
be
rejoice
at
the
circumstance
,
the
repast
usually
serve
at
noon
be
bring
in
by
a
fresh
serving
-
man
.
<EOS>
something
in
this
person
's
manner
,
and
in
the
meaning
glance
he
fix
upon
her
attract
her
attention
;
otherwise
,
he
be
a
man
of
singularly
unprepossessing
appearance
.
<EOS>
She
address
a
few
word
to
him
,
but
he
make
no
reply
,
and
become
suddenly
as
reserved
as
his
predecessor
have
be
.
<EOS>
this
deportment
,
however
,
it
presently
appear
,
be
only
assume
.
<EOS>
while
place
a
flask
of
wine
on
the
table
,
the
man
say
in
a
low
tone—"I

<EOS>
"Is

<EOS>
"
she
ask
in
a
whisper
,
regard
him
anxiously
.
<EOS>
"It
be
suppose
to
be
so
,
"
he
answer
,
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
.
<EOS>
"

,
I
say
.
<EOS>
if
you
do
not
,
you
will
mar
my
project

'
<EOS>
Tis
well
!
<EOS>
"
he
add
,
as
she
raise
the
goblet
to
her
lip
.
<EOS>
"
a
few
word
must
explain
my
design
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
will
fancy
you
have
swallow
a
love
-
potion
.
<EOS>
take
care
not
to
undeceive
him
,
for
on
that
belief
rest
your
safety
.
<EOS>
when
he
present
himself
,
as
he
will
do
shortly
,
do
not
repulse
him
as
heretofore
.
<EOS>
smile
on
him
as
kindly
as
you
can
;
and
though
the
task
of
dupe
him
may
be
difficult
and
distasteful
to
you
,
shrink
not
from
it
.
<EOS>
the
necessity
of
the
case
justify
the
deception
.
<EOS>
if
he
press
his
suit
,
no
longer
refuse
him
your
hand
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
do
it
,
"
murmured
Aveline
,
with
a
shudder
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
MUST
,
"
rejoin
Luke
Hatton
—
for
it
be
he—"or
incur
bad
danger
.
<EOS>
provoke
by
your
resistance
,
Sir
Francis
have
lose
all
patience
,
and
be
determined
to
accomplish
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
know
my
skill
as
a
brewer
of
philter
,
he
have
apply
to
me
,
and
I
have
promise
him
aid
.
<EOS>
but
have
no
fear
.
<EOS>
though
employ
by
him
,
I
be
devoted
to
you
,
and
will
effect
your
deliverance
—
ay
,
and
avenge
you
upon
your
persecutor
at
the
same
time
—
if
you
follow
my
instruction
exactly
.
<EOS>
raise
the
goblet
to
your
lip
again
.
<EOS>
quaff
its
content
without
apprehension
—
they
be
perfectly
harmless
.
<EOS>
force
smile
to
your
feature
—
give
tenderness
to
your
tone
,
and
softness
to
your
glance
—
and
all
will
be
win
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
with
a
grin
,
which
,
though
intend
to
encourage
her
,
somewhat
alarm
Aveline
,
he
take
up
the
flask
of
wine
and
depart
.
<EOS>
as
her
singular
adviser
have
predict
,
it
be
not
long
before
the
old
usurer
make
his
appearance
,
evidently
full
of
eagerness
to
ascertain
whether
any
change
have
be
work
in
her
disposition
towards
him
by
the
wonder
-
working
draught
.
<EOS>
dissemble
her
aversion
as
well
as
she
could
,
and
assume
look
very
foreign
to
her
feeling
,
she
easily
succeed
in
persuade
him
that
the
philter
have
take
effect
,
and
that
all
obstacle
to
his
happiness
be
remove
.
<EOS>
transport
with
rapture
,
he
fall
upon
his
knee
,
and
besought
her
to
crown
his
felicity
by
consent
to
their
union
on
the
follow
day
.
<EOS>
bewilder
by
various
emotion
,
yet
still
manage
to
play
her
part
,
she
return
an
answer
,
which
he
construe
into
an
affirmative
;
and
now
quite
beside
himself
with
delight
,
the
amorous
old
dotard
leave
her
.
<EOS>
the
alteration
in
Aveline
's
manner
and
deportment
towards
her
persecutor
,
do
not
escape
the
notice
of
her
attendant
,
and
greatly
perplex
them
.
<EOS>
Dame
Sherborne
venture
to
remonstrate
with
her
,
hope
she
could
not
be
in
earnest
;
and
old
Anthony
Rocke
bluntly
tell
her
he
would
rather
see
her
in
her
grave
than
the
bride
of
such
a
hoary
reprobate
as
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
aware
that
her
action
be
watch
,
Aveline
think
it
best
to
dissemble
,
even
with
her
attendant
;
and
they
be
both
convinced
she
be
either
bewitch
or
have
lose
her
sense
;
and
in
either
case
bitterly
deplore
her
fate
.
<EOS>
nor
must
it
be
suppose
that
Aveline
herself
be
without
much
secret
misgiving
,
however
skilfully
<EOS>
and
courageously
she
may
act
her
part
.
<EOS>
the
appearance
of
Luke
Hatton
,
as
we
have
more
than
once
remark
,
be
calculate
to
inspire
distrust
in
all
bring
in
contact
with
him
;
and
with
no
other
proof
of
his
sincerity
except
such
as
be
furnish
by
the
circumstance
,
she
may
well
entertain
suspicion
of
him
.
<EOS>
while
profess
devotion
,
he
may
intend
to
betray
her
.
<EOS>
in
that
event
,
if
drive
to
extremity
,
she
resolve
to
liberate
herself
by
the
only
mean
that
would
then
be
leave
her
.
<EOS>
in
the
evening
,
Luke
Hatton
pay
her
a
second
visit
;
and
on
this
occasion
comport
himself
with
as
much
caution
as
at
first
.
<EOS>
He
applaud
her
conduct
towards
Sir
Francis
,
whom
he
state
to
be
most
effectually
dupe
,
and
counsel
her
to
persevere
in
the
same
course
;
add
,
with
his
customary
sardonic
grin
,
that
grand
preparation
be
make
for
the
wedding
-
feast
,
but
he
think
the
cook
's
labour
likely
to
be
throw
away
.
<EOS>
next
day
,
Aveline
find
all
her
counsellor
have
tell
her
be
correct
.
<EOS>
several
of
the
room
,
hitherto
thrown
open
to
her
—
in
especial
the
great
banquetting
-
chamber
—
be
now
closed
;
and
it
be
evident
from
the
sound
that
reach
her
ear
—
footstep
hurry
to
and
fro
,
loud
impatient
voice
,
and
noise
occasion
by
the
removal
of
furniture
,
and
the
placing
of
chair
and
table
,
together
with
the
clatter
of
plate
and
dish
—
that
preparation
for
a
festival
be
go
on
actively
within
them
.
<EOS>
nothing
could
equal
the
consternation
and
distress
exhibit
by
Dame
Sherborne
and
old
Anthony
Rocke
;
but
,
faithful
to
her
scheme
,
Aveline
(
however
she
desire
it
)
do
not
relieve
their
anxiety
.
<EOS>
at
noon
,
Luke
Hatton
come
again
.
<EOS>
He
seem
in
great
glee
;
and
inform
her
that
all
be
go
on
as
well
as
could
be
desire
.
<EOS>
He
counsel
her
to
make
two
request
of
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
first
,
that
he
should
endow
her
with
ten
thousand
mark
,
to
be
deliver
to
her
before
the
nuptial
;
secondly
,
that
she
should
be
permit
to
shroud
her
feature
and
person
in
a
veil
during
the
marriage
ceremony
.
<EOS>
without
inquire
the
meaning
of
these
request
,
which
,
indeed
,
she
partly
conjecture
,
Aveline
promise
ready
compliance
;
and
her
adviser
leave
her
,
but
not
till
he
have
once
more
proffer
her
the
suppose
philter
,
and
cause
her
to
place
the
cup
contain
it
to
her
lip
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
he
be
succeed
by
Sir
Francis
,
array
like
a
bridegroom
,
in
doublet
and
hose
of
white
satin
,
thickly
lay
with
silver
lace
,
and
a
short
french
mantle
of
sky
-
blue
velvet
,
branch
with
silver
flower
,
white
rose
in
his
shoe
,
and
droop
white
plume
,
arrange
à
l'Espagnolle
,
in
his
hat
.
<EOS>
besides
this
,
he
be
trim
,
curl
,
oil
,
and
would
have
get
himself
grind
young
again
,
have
such
a
process
be
practicable
.
<EOS>
but
though
he
could
not
effect
this
,
he
do
the
next
thing
to
it
,
and
employ
all
the
restorative
suggest
by
Luke
Hatton
.
<EOS>
He
bathe
in
milk
,
breakfast
on
snail
-
broth
,
and
swallow
a
strange
potion
prepare
for
him
by
the
apothecary
,
which
the
latter
affirmed
would
make
a
new
man
of
him
and
renovate
all
his
youthful
ardour
.
<EOS>
It
certainly
have
produce
an
extraordinary
effect
;
and
when
he
present
himself
before
Aveline
,
his
gesture
be
so
extravagant
,
and
his
look
so
wild
and
unpleasant
,
that
it
be
with
the
utmost
difficulty
she
repress
a
scream
.
<EOS>
His
cheek
be
flush
,
as
if
with
fever
,
and
his
eye
dilate
and
burn
with
unnatural
lustre
.
<EOS>
He
speak
almost
incoherently
,
toss
his
arm
about
,
and
perform
the
antic
of
a
madman
.
<EOS>
the
philter
;
it
be
clear
,
have
be
give
him
,
and
he
be
now
under
its
influence
.
<EOS>
amid
all
this
strange
frenzy
,
so
alarming
to
Aveline
,
he
dwell
upon
nothing
but
his
inextinguishable
passion
,
and
never
for
a
moment
withdraw
his
fevered
gaze
from
her
.
<EOS>
He
tell
her
he
would
be
her
slave
for
life
,
proud
to
wear
her
chain
;
and
that
she
should
be
absolute
mistress
of
his
house
and
all
his
possession
.
<EOS>
on
this
she
muster
up
resolution
to
prefer
the
request
she
have
be
counsel
to
make
;
and
Sir
Francis
,
who
be
in
no
mood
to
refuse
her
anything
,
at
once
accede
to
them
.
<EOS>
He
laugh
at
the
notion
of
the
veil
—
say
it
be
a
delicate
fancy
,
and
quite
charm
him
—
but
as
to
the
ten
thousand
mark
,
they
be
utterly
unworthy
of
her
acceptance
,
and
she
should
have
thrice
the
amount
deliver
to
her
in
a
silver
coffer
before
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
with
these
,
and
a
great
many
other
profession
,
he
release
her
from
his
presence
,
which
have
become
well
-
nigh
insupportable
.
<EOS>
after
a
while
,
a
magnificent
bridal
-
dress
of
white
satin
,
richly
trim
with
lace
,
together
with
a
thick
white
veil
of
the
large
size
,
calculate
to
envelope
her
whole
person
,
be
bring
her
by
a
young
damsel
,
who
tell
her
she
be

to
serve
her
as
tire

woman
;
add
,
that
"
she
hope
she
would
be
able
to
satisfy
her
ladyship
,
as
she
have
already
serve
the
Countess
of
Exeter
in
that
capacity
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
do
you
call
me

ladyship
'
child
?
"
say
Aveline
,
without
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
right
to
any
such
title
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
you
soon
will
have

"
reply
the
young
tire
-
woman
;
"
as
the
bride
of
Sir
Francis

,
you
must
needs
be
my
Lady
Mitchell
.
<EOS>
"checke
<EOS>
the
rejoinder
that
rise
to
her
lip
<EOS>
,
Aveline
cast
her
eye
,
for
the
first
time
,
on
the
speaker
;
and
then
,
to
her
great
surprise
,
perceive
it
to
be
her
village
acquaintance
,
Gillian
Greenford
.
<EOS>
a
significant
glance
from
the
blue
eye
of
the
pretty
damsel
impress
her
with
the
necessity
of
caution
,
and
seem
to
intimate
that
Gillian

in
private
to

inform
her
of
the
real

<EOS>
"I

"And

I
now
see
the
meaning
of
that
part
of
the
plan

what
else
do
you
hope
to
accomplish?""the
deliverance
of
my
unfortunate

You
may

""no

Gillian

hastily
;
"
I
can
not

how
it

I
be
quite
sure
no

the

I

thus
much
I
may
declare
—
I

the

who
,
for
some

of
his

now

no

We
be
both
pretty
nearly

there

apprehensive

Aveline
would
have

be
deter

from
the

confusion

Uncertain

after
look
round
for
a
moment

in

some
one
to

the

of

at

something
in

rejoin
Charles
in
a
stern
tone
and
with
a
freezing
look
,
that
seem
of
ill
augury
to
the
extortioner—"It

chapter
XXXI.Accusations
.
<EOS>
by
this
time
a
very
different
complexion
have
be
impart
to
the
scene
.
<EOS>
the
interruption
of
the
marriage
ceremony
,
and
the
perplexity
of
the
old
usurer
,
trick
out
of
his
intend
bride
,
and
bereft
even
of
her
substitute
,
have
afford
abundant
amusement
to
the
company
,
who
,
so
far
from
feel
pity
for
the
sufferer
,
seem
vastly
to
enjoy
his
mortification
and
disappointment
.
<EOS>
but
all
laughter
die
away
,
and
every
tongue
become
suddenly
mute
,
as
Prince
Charles
,
assume
the
severe
look
and
dignified
deportment
of
a
judge
,
command
Clement
Lanyere
to
stand
forward
,
and
prefer
the
charge
he
have
to
make
against
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
all
eye
be
fix
upon
the
extortioner
and
his
accuser
;
and
though
etiquette
prevent
the
company
from
advance
too
near
the
royal
seat
,
a
dense
semicircle
be
form
in
front
of
it
,
in
the
midst
of
which
stand
the
two
principal
actor
in
the
drama
about
to
take
place
,
together
with
the
discomfited
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
be
not
without
great
misgiving
.
<EOS>
He
see
that
his
case
be
already
prejudge
by
the
Prince
;
and
the
glance
of
inquiry
with
which
he
have
consult
his
patron
,
the
Marquis
of
Buckingham
,
and
which
be
answer
by
a
cold
,
menacing
regard
,
convince
him
that
little
support
be
to
be
expect
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
though
he
feel
himself
in
considerable
jeopardy
,
he
allow
no
look
or
gesture
indicative
of
uneasiness
to
escape
him
;
and
the
courage
that
have
bear
him
through
many
a
trial
still
remain
unshaken
.
<EOS>
not
so
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
.
<EOS>
He
also
perceive
the
perilous
position
in
which
he
and
his
partner
be
place
,
and
his
abject
manner
show
how
thoroughly
he
be
daunt
.
<EOS>
look
wherever
he
would
,
he
find
no
sympathy
:
every
one
deride
his
distress
.
<EOS>
but
far
more
than
the
two
extortioner
do
their
accuser
command
attention
.
<EOS>
as
he
cast
off
his
mask
and
display
his
appalling
feature
,
a
thrill
of
surprise
and
horror
pervade
such
of
the
assemblage
as
have
never
see
them
before
.
<EOS>
but
the
feeling
be
speedily
lose
in
wonder
.
<EOS>
draw
himself
up
to
his
full
height
,
so
that
his
lofty
figure
tower
above
those
with
whom
he
be
confront
,
he
seem
to
dart
lightning
glance
against
them
.
<EOS>
even
Sir
Giles
could
not
bear
his
scathing
look
,
and
would
have
shield
himself
from
them
if
he
could
.
<EOS>
though
fearful
to
behold
,
Lanyere
's
countenance
have
a
terrible
purpose
impress
upon
it
which
none
could
mistake
.
<EOS>
the
effect
produce
by
his
appearance
upon
the
spectator
be
share
even
by
Prince
Charles
,
and
a
few
minute
elapse
before
the
silence
be
break
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
the
Prince
again
spoke:—"I
sit
here
,
"
he
say
,
"
as
the
representative
of
the
Majesty
of
England
—
clothe
with
the
authority
of
my
royal
father
,
and
prepare
to
exercise
it
,
as
he
would
do
be
he
present
in
person
.
<EOS>
but
though
this
seat
be
erect
into
a
tribunal
before
which
accusation
against
wrong
-
doer
can
be
bring
,
and
sentence
upon
them
pronounce
;
still
,
whatever
charge
be
now
make
,
and
against
whomsoever
they
may
be
prefer
,
those
charge
will
have
to
be
repeat
to
the
Lords
of
the
Council
of
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
before
whom
the
accuse
will
be
take
;
and
any
judgment
now
give
will
have
to
be
confirm
by
that
high
and
honourable
court
.
<EOS>
of
late
,
the
course
of
justice
have
be
too
often
baffle
and
turn
aside
by
the
craft
and
subtlety
of
certain
powerful
and
audacious
offender
.
<EOS>
hence
it
have
be
the
wish
of
the
King
's
Highness
,
in
order
that
the
law
may
no
longer
be
break
with
impunity
,
that
certain
preliminary
inquiry
and
investigation
should
be
make
on
the
spot
itself
,
where
it
be
allege
that
the
crime
and
misdemeanour
have
be
commit
;
and
,
accord
to
the
evidence
afford
,
such
measure
as
may
be
deem
fitting
take
against
the
wrong
-
doer
.
<EOS>
all
present
have
witness
this
mock
ceremonial
,
and
have
laugh
at
its
conclusion
,
but
mirth
will
be
change
to
indignation
,
when
it
be
know
that
the
intended
marriage
be
the
result
of
a
vile
conspiracy
on
the
part
of
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
and
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
,
against
a
young
,
virtuous
,
and
unprotected
maiden
,
whose
beauty
have
inflame
the
breast
of
the
elder
,
and
it
may
have
be
expect
from
that
circumstance
,
the
wiser
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
into
the
detail
of
their
infamous
scheme
,
it
will
not
be
necessary
now
to
enter
;
and
it
may
suffice
to
say
,
that
the
devoted
attachment
of
the
damsel
to
another
be
wholly
disregard
,
while
the
basest
mean
be
employ
to
induce
her
consent
to
a
match
so
abhorrent
to
her
feeling
,
as
must
have
be
that
with
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
fail
in
this
,
however
,
the
two
conspirator
go
yet
further
.
<EOS>
They
forcibly
carry
off
the
maiden
from
her
own
dwelling
,
and
detain
her
against
her
will
within
this
house
,
till
by
their
art
they
imagine
they
have
gain
their
point
—
and
that
a
love
-
potion
would
accomplish
all
for
them
,
that
their
persuasion
and
fair
promise
be
unable
to
effect
.
<EOS>
but
the
damsel
be
guard
from
all
ill
by
an
unseen
friend
—
and
the
weapon
of
the
conspirator
be
turn
against
themselves
.
<EOS>
You
have
witness
how
they
have
be
dupe
,
and
,
as
no
mischief
have
result
from
this
infamous
endeavour
,
the
mortification
they
have
endure
may
be
take
as
part
punishment
of
the
offence
.
<EOS>
stand
forward
,
fair
Mistress
Aveline
Calveley
,
and
substantiate
what
I
have
just
declare
.
<EOS>
"Thus
adjure
,
the
maiden
approach
within
a
few
pace
of
the
Prince
,
and
have
make
a
lowly
salutation

said,—"All

I
repel
the
charge

indignation

my
turn

Clement
Lanyere

Luke
Hatton

a
conspiracy

me

damsel

their

give
ear

me

fabrication

Charles

<EOS>

evidence

willing

misery

grievously
as

I
seek
no

would
implore

""Amply

the
old
usurer

scornful
smile

Sir
Giles

there
nothing

may

other
and
dark
disclosure
have
to
be
make
;
and
when
you
have
hear
all

even
your
compassionate

"Were

relate
all

the
recital
would
be
too
painful

that
of

I
will
,
in
a
word
,
declare
that
there
be
no
kind
of
outrage
,
oppression
,
and
extortion
of
which
they
have
not
be
guilty

<EOS>
Their
insatiable
greediness
have
be
feed
by
constant
plunder
;
and
,
alike
cruel
and
rapacious
,
nothing
but
the
ruin

absolute
destruction
of
their
victim
would
content
them

<EOS>
merciless
as
creditor

they
have
grind
their
unfortunate
debtor
to
the
dust

<EOS>
the
tear
of
the
widow

have
rob
of
her
husband

her
mean
of
existence
—
the
despair
of
the
orphan
,
whose
fair
prospect
they
have
blight
—
have
fail
to
move
them

<EOS>
utterly
unscrupulous
as
to
the
mean
of
obtain
possession
of
property
,
they
have
forge
will
,
deed
,
and
other
document

<EOS>
Their
ingenuity
have
be
tax
to
devise
new
mean
of
unjust
gain
;
and
,
impose
upon
the
King

Majesty
by
false
representation

they
have
succeed
in

his

patent
for
certain

through

<EOS>
tis
my

that
of

<EOS>
We

the

<EOS>
to
affirm
that
we
have
employ
the

as
an
instrument
of
oppression

extortion
be
an
assertion
too
monstrous
to

<EOS>
the
Star

be
too
jealous

such

<EOS>
""Nevertheless

my
word

not
be
forget
by

<EOS>
I
assert
that
Sir

Mompesson
have
subtly
and
designedly
pervert
the
practice
of
that
high
and
honourable
court
,
cause
it
to
aid
his
scheme
of
rapacity
and
injustice
,
and
use
it
as
a
means
of
stifle
the
cry
of
his
victim
,
and
work
out
his
purpose
of
vengeance
.
<EOS>
hitherto
,
he
have
succeed
in
mask
his
design
with
so
much
skill
that
they
have
escape
detection
;
but
when
the
mischief
he
have
do
under
the
mask
of
justice
,
and
the
wrong
and
cruelty
he
have
perpetrate
in
the
name
of
the
law
shall
be
fully
make
known
,
no
punishment
will
be
deem
commensurate
to
his
crime
.
<EOS>
It
be
chiefly
he
and
his
partner
who
,
by
their
evil
doing
,
have
bring
the
Star

Chamber
into
disrepute
,
and
make
it
a
terror
to
all
just
man
,
who
have
dread
be
catch
within
the
toil
weave
around
it
by
these
infamous
wretch
;
and
the
Court
will
do
well
to
purge
itself
of
such
villanie
,
and
make
a
terrible
example
of
those
who
have
so
dishonour
it
.
<EOS>
""The

a

She
could

in

flask

noise

his
pretty
wife

Gillian

in
indissoluble

old
Greenford
,
the
grandsire
of
the
bride
;
and
Master
John
Wolfe
,
of
the
Bible
and
Crown
in
Paul
's
Churchyard
,
bookseller
,
erstwhile
Dick
's
indulgent
master
,
and
now
his
partner
,
Master
Taverner
have
very
prudently
invest
the
content
of
the
silver
coffer
in
the
purchase
of
a
share
in
his
employer
business
,
with
the
laudable
determination
of
bestir
himself
zealously
in
it
ever
after
;
and
,
as
another
opportunity
may
not
occur
for
mention
the
circumstance
,
we
will
add
that
he
keep
to
his
resolution
,
and
ultimately
rise
to
high
office
in
the
city
.
<EOS>
Dick
's
appearance
have
already
considerably
improve
.
<EOS>
His
apparel
be
spruce
and
neat
,
but
not
showy
,
and
well
become
him
;
while
his
deportment
,
even
under
the
blissful
circumstance
in
which
he
be
place
,
have
a
sobriety
and
decorum
about
it
really
surprising
,
and
which
argue
well
for
his
future
good
conduct
.
<EOS>
He
begin
as
he
mean
to
go
on
;
and
it
be
plain
that
John
Wolfe
's
advice
have
produce
a
salutary
effect
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Old
Greenford
look
the
picture
of
happiness

<EOS>
with
Master
Richard
's
predilection
for
the
Three
Cranes
we
be
well
acquainted
,
and
it
will
not
,
therefore
,
appear
unnatural
that
he
should
choose
this
,
his
favourite
tavern
,
for
his
wedding
-
dinner
.
<EOS>
Madame
Bonaventure
be
delight
with
the
bride
,
and
bring
the
blush
to
her
fair
cheek
by
the
warmth
of
her
praise
of
her
beauty
;
while
she
could
not
sufficiently
congratulate
the
bridegroom
on
his
good
luck
in
obtain
such
a
treasure

<EOS>
the

and
ample
justice

<EOS>
Cyprien
,
as
usual
,
bring
in
the
dish
,
and
fill
the
flagon
with
the
rare
Bordeaux
he
have
be
direct
by
his
mistress
to
introduce
;
but
Madame
Bonaventure
personally
superintend
the
repast
,
carve
the
meat
,
select
the
most
delicate
bit
for
Gillian
's
especial
consumption
,
and
season
them
yet
more
agreeably
with
her
lively
sally
.
<EOS>
the
dinner
have
come
to
a
close
,
and
they
be
just
drink
the
health
of
the
bonny
and
blush
bride
,
when
the
clamour
on
the
quay
proclaim
the
old
usurer
's
arrival
.
<EOS>
as
he
be
the
furth
person
from
her
thought
,
and
as
she
have
not
hear
of
the
day
appoint
for
his
punishment
,
Madame
Bonaventure
be
totally
unprepared
for
the
spectacle
offer
to
her
when
she
reach
the
window
;
and
her
retreat
from
it
,
as
we
have
relate
,
be
almost
immediate
.
<EOS>
to
his
shame
be
it
speak
,
Master
Richard
Taverner
be
greatly
entertain
by
the
doleful
appear
of
his
old
enemy
,
and
could
not
help
exult
over
his
downfall
and
distress
;
but
he
be
quickly
check
by
his
bride
,
who
share
in
the
hostess
's
gentle
and
more
compassionate
feeling
.
<EOS>
so
much
,
indeed
,
be
the
gentle
Gillian
touch
by
the
delinquent
's
supplicate
look
,
that
she
yield
to
the
impulse
that
prompt
her
to
afford
him
some
solace
,
and
snatch
up
a
flask
of
wine
and
a
flagon
from
the
table
,
she
rush
out
of
the
room
,
follow
by
her
husband
,
who
vainly
endeavour
to
stay
her
.
<EOS>
in
a
moment
Gillian
be
out
upon
the
quay
;
and
the
mount
guard
station
round
the
prisoner
,
divine
her
purpose
,
kindly
draw
aside
to
let
her
pass
.
<EOS>
fill
the
goblet
,
she
hand
it
to
the
old
man
,
who
eagerly
drain
it
,
and
breathe
a
blessing
on
her
as
he
return
it
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
bystander
say
the
blessing
would
turn
to
a
curse
—
but
it
be
not
so
;
and
so
well
pleased
be
Dick
with
what
his
good
wife
have
do
,
that
he
clasp
her
to
his
heart
before
all
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
this
incident
be
so
far
of
service
to
the
prisoner
,
that
it
save
him
from
further
indignity
at
the
moment
.
<EOS>
the
mob
cease
to
jeer
him
,
or
to
hurl
mud
and
missile
at
him
,
and
listen
in
silence
to
the
public
crier
as
he
read
aloud
his
sentence
.
<EOS>
this
do
,
the
poor
wretch
and
his
escort
move
away
to
the
Catherine
Wheel
,
in
the
Steelyard
,
where
a
less
kindly
reception
await
him
.
<EOS>
in
take
leave
,
as
we
must
now
do
,
of
Master
Richard
Taverner
and
his
pretty
wife
,
it
give
us
pleasure
to
say
that
they
be
as
happy
in
their
wed
state
as
love
couple
necessarily
must
be
.
<EOS>
We
may
add
that
they
live
long
,
and
be
bless
with
numerous
issue
—
so
noumerous
indeed
,
that
,
as
we
have
before
intimate
,
Dick
have
to
work
hard
all
the
rest
of
his
day
.
<EOS>
in
bidding
adieu
,
also
,
to
Madame
Bonaventure
,
which
we
do
with
regret
,
we
have
merely
to
state
that
she
do
not
reign
much
longer
over
the
destiny
of
the
Three
Cranes
,
but
resign
in
favour
of
Cyprien
,
who
,
as
Monsieur
Latour
,
be
long
and
favourably
know
as
the
jovial
and
liberal
host
of
that
renowned
tavern
.
<EOS>
various
reason
be
assign
for
Madame
Bonaventure
's
retirement
;
but
the
truth
be
,
that
have
make
money
enough
,
she
begin
to
find
the
bank
of
the
Thames
too
damp
and
foggy
for
her
,
especially
during
the
winter
month
;
so
the
next
time
the
skipper
enter
the
river
,
have
previously
make
her
arrangement
,
she
embark
on
board
his
vessel
,
and
return
to
the
sunny
shore
of
the
Garonne

<EOS>
Mompesson
's
sentence
,
though
far
more
severe
and
opprobrious
than
that
of
the
elder
extortioner
,
be
think
too
lenient
,
and
most
person
be
of
opinion
that
,
consider
the
enormity
of
his
offence
,
his
life
ought
not
to
be
spare
.
<EOS>
but
they
judge
unadvisedly
.
<EOS>
death
by
the
axe
,
or
even
by
the
rope
,
would
have
be
infinitely
prefer
by
the
criminal
himself
,
to
the
linger
agony
he
be
destine
to
endure
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
there
be
retributive
justice
in
the
sentence
,
that
doom
him
to
undergo
torture
similar
to
those
he
have
so
often
inflict
on
other
.
<EOS>
the
pillory
be
erect
at
Charing
Cross
.
<EOS>
a
numerous
escort
be
require
to
protect
him
from
the
fury
of
the
mob
,
who
would
otherwise
have
tear
him
in
piece
;
but
,
though
shield
in
some
degree
from
their
active
vengeance
,
he
could
not
shut
his
ear
to
their
yell
and
execration
.
<EOS>
infuriate
thousand
be
collect
in
the
open
space
around
the
pillory
,
eager
to
glut
their
eye
upon
the
savage
spectacle
;
and
the
shout
they
set
up
on
his
appearance
be
so
terrific
,
that
even
the
prisoner
,
undaunte
as
he
have
hitherto
show
himself
,
be
shake
by
it
,
and
lose
his
firmness
,
though
he
recover
it
in
some
degree
as
he
mount
the
huge
wooden
machine
,
conspicuous
at
a
distance
above
the
head
of
the
rage
multitude
.
<EOS>
on
the
board
on
which
he
have
to
stand
,
there
be
another
person
besides
the
tormentor,—and
<EOS>
the
sight
of
him
evidently
occasion
the
criminal
great
disquietude
.
<EOS>
this
person
be
attire
in
black
,
with
a
broad
-
leaved
hat
pull
down
over
his
brow
.
<EOS>
"What
doth
this
fellow
here
?
<EOS>
"
demand
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
need
an
assistant
.
<EOS>
""i
know
not
that
,
"
reply
the
tormentor,—a
big
,
brawny
fellow
,
habit
in
a
leathern
jerkin
,
with
his
arm
bare
to
the
shoulder,—taking
up
his
hammer
and
select
a
couple
of
sharp
-
pointed
nail
;
"
but
in
any
case
he
have
an
order
from
the
Council
of
the
Star
-
Chamber
to
stand
here
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
prisoner
,
"
he
continue
roughly
and
authoritatively,—"place
your
head
in
this
hole
,
and
your
hand
here
.
<EOS>
"Since
<EOS>
resistance
would
have
be
vain
,
Mompesson
do
as
he
be
bidden
.
<EOS>
a
heavy
beam
descend
over
his
neck
and
wrist
,
and
fasten
him
down
immovably
;
while
,
amid
the
exult
shout
of
the
spectator
,
his
ear
be
nail
to
the
wood
.
<EOS>
during
one
entire
hour
the
ponderous
machine
slowly
revolve
,
so
as
to
exhibit
him
to
all
the
assemblage
;
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
yet
more
barbarous
part
of
the
sentence
,
for
which
the
ferocious
mob
have
be
impatiently
wait
,
be
carry
out
.
<EOS>
the
keen
knife
and
the
branding
-
iron
be
call
into
play
,
and
in
the
bleeding
and
mutilated
object
before
them
,
now
stamp
with
indelible
infamy
,
none
could
have
recognise
the
once
haughty
and
handsome
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
a
third
person
,
we
have
say
,
stand
upon
the
pillory
.
<EOS>
He
take
no
part
in
aid
the
tormentor
in
his
task
;
but
he
watch
all
that
be
do
with
atrocious
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
not
a
groan
—
not
the
quivering
of
a
muscle
escape
him
.
<EOS>
He
feel
the
edge
of
the
knife
to
make
sure
it
be
sharp
enough
for
the
purpose
,
and
see
that
the
iron
be
sufficiently
heated
to
burn
the
character
of
shame
deeply
in
.
<EOS>
when
all
be
accomplish
,
he
seize
Mompesson
's
arm
,
and
,
in
a
voice
that
seem
scarcely
human
,
cried,—"Now
,
I
have
pay
thee
back
in
part
for
the
injuries
thou
hast
do
me
.
<EOS>
Thou
wilt
never
mock
me
more!""In
part
!
"
groan
Mompesson
.
"
<EOS>
be
not
thy
vengeance
fully
satiate
?
<EOS>
what
more
wouldst
thou
have?""What
more
?
"
echo
the
other
,
with
the
laugh
of
a
demon,—"for
every
day
of
anguish
thou
gavest
<EOS>
my
brother
in
his
dungeon
in
the
Fleet
<EOS>
I
would
have
a
month
—
a
year
,
I
would
not
have
thee
perish
too
soon
,
and
therefore
thou
shalt
be
better
care
for
than
he
be
.
<EOS>
but
thou
shalt
never
escape
—
never
!
<EOS>
and
at
the
last
I
will
be
by
thy
side
.
<EOS>
"It
would
almost
seem
as
if
that
moment
be
come
,
for
,
as
the
word
be
utter
,
Mompesson
faint
from
loss
of
blood
and
intensity
of
pain
,
and
in
this
state
he
be
place
upon
a
hurdle
tie
to
a
horse
's
heel
,
and
convey
back
to
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
as
threaten
,
he
be
doom
to
long
and
solitary
imprisonment
,
and
the
only
person
,
beside
the
jailer
,
admit
to
his
cell
,
be
his
unrelenting
foe
.
<EOS>
a
steel
mirror
be
hang
up
in
his
dungeon
,
so
that
he
may
see
to
what
extent
his
feature
have
be
disfigure
.
<EOS>
in
this
way
three
year
roll
by
—
year
of
uninterrupted
happiness
to
Sir
Jocelyn
and
Lady
Mounchensey
,
as
well
as
to
Master
Richard
Taverner
and
his
dame
;
but
of
increase
gloom
to
the
captive
in
his
solitary
cell
in
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
of
late
,
he
have
become
so
fierce
and
unmanageable
that
he
have
to
be
chain
to
the
wall
.
<EOS>
He
spring
at
his
jailer
and
try
to
strangle
him
,
and
gnash
his
tooth
,
and
shake
his
fist
in
impotent
rage
at
Osmond
Mounchensey
.
<EOS>
but
again
his
mood
change
,
and
he
would
supplicate
for
mercy
,
crawl
on
the
floor
,
and
try
to
kiss
the
foot
of
his
enemy
,
who
spurn
him
from
him
.
<EOS>
then
he
fall
sick
,
and
refuse
his
food
;
and
,
as
the
sole
mean
of
preserve
his
life
,
he
be
remove
to
an
airier
chamber
.
<EOS>
but
as
it
speedily
appear
,
this
be
only
a
device
to
enable
him
to
escape
from
prison,—and
<EOS>
it
prove
successful
.
<EOS>
He
be
think
to
be
so
ill
that
the
jailer
,
fancy
him
incapable
of
move
,
become
negligent
,
and
when
Osmond
Mounchensey
next
appear
,
the
prisoner
have
fly
.
<EOS>
how
he
have
effect
his
escape
<EOS>
no
one
<EOS>
could
at
first
explain
;
<EOS>
but
it
appear
,
on
inquiry
,
that
he
have
be
assist
by
two
of
his
old
myrmidon
,
Captain
Bludder
and
Staring
Hugh
,
both
of
whom
be
prisoner
at
the
time
in
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
Osmond
's
rage
know
no
bound
.
<EOS>
He
vow
never
to
rest
till
he
have
trace
out
the
fugitive
,
and
bring
him
back
.
<EOS>
but
he
experience
more
difficulty
in
the
quest
than
he
anticipate
.
<EOS>
no
one
be
better
acquaint
with
the
obscure
quarter
and
hiding
-
place
of
London
than
he
;
but
in
none
of
these
retreat
could
he
discover
the
object
of
his
search
.
<EOS>
the
potentate
of
Whitefriars
and
the
Mint
would
not
have
dare
to
harbour
such
an
offender
as
Mompesson
,
and
would
have
give
him
up
at
once
if
he
have
seek
refuge
in
their
territory
.
<EOS>
but
Osmond
satisfy
himself
,
by
a
perquisition
of
every
house
in
those
sanctuary
,
that
he
be
not
there
.
<EOS>
nor
have
any
one
be
see
like
him
.
<EOS>
the
asylum
for
"
masterless
man
,
"
near
Smart
's
Quay
,
and
all
the
other
den
for
thief
and
criminal
hide
from
justice
,
in
and
about
the
metropolis
,
be
search
,
but
with
the
like
ill
result
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
Mompesson
have
contrive
entirely
to
baffle
the
vigilance
of
his
foe
.
<EOS>
at
last
,
Osmond
apply
to
Luke
Hatton
,
think
it
possible
his
cunning
may
suggest
some
plan
for
the
capture
of
the
fugitive
.
<EOS>
after
listen
with
the
great
attention
to
all
relate
to
him
,
the
apothecary
ponder
for
awhile
,
and
then
said—"It
be
plain
he
have
trust
no
one
with
his
retreat
,
but
I
think
I
can
find
him
.
<EOS>
come
to
me
on
the
third
night
from
this
,
and
you
shall
hear
further
.
<EOS>
meantime
,
you
need
not
relax
your
own
search
,
though
,
if
it
be
as
I
suspect
,
failure
be
sure
to
attend
you
.
<EOS>
"oblige
to
be
satisfied
with
this
promise
,
Osmond
depart
.
<EOS>
on
the
third
night
,
at
a
late
hour
,
he
return
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
,
however
,
find
Luke
Hatton
.
<EOS>
the
apothecary
,
it
appear
,
have
be
absent
from
home
during
the
last
three
day
,
and
the
old
woman
who
attend
upon
him
be
full
of
uneasiness
on
his
account
.
<EOS>
Her
master
,
she
say
,
have
leave
a
letter
on
his
table
,
and
on
investigation
it
prove
to
be
for
Osmond
.
<EOS>
in
it
the
writer
direct
him
,
in
the
event
of
his
non
-
return
before
the
time
appoint
,
to
repair
without
delay
,
well
armed
,
to
the
vault
beneath
Mompesson
's
old
habitation
near
the
Fleet
,
and
to
make
strict
search
for
him
throughout
them
.
<EOS>
He
also
acquaint
him
with
a
secret
entrance
into
the
house
,
contrive
in
the
wall
beneath
the
lofty
north
-
eastern
turret
.
<EOS>
on
read
this
letter
,
Osmond
at
once
understand
his
ally
's
plan
,
together
with
its
danger
,
and
feel
that
,
as
he
have
not
return
,
he
have
,
in
all
probability
,
fall
a
victim
to
his
rashness
.
<EOS>
tell
the
old
woman
whither
he
be
go
,
and
that
inquiry
may
be
make
there
for
him
on
the
morrow
,
if
he
do
not
re
-
appear
with
her
master
,
he
set
out
at
once
for
the
place
indicate
.
<EOS>
We
shall
,
however
,
precede
him
.
<EOS>
ever
since
Mompesson
have
be
take
to
the
Fleet
,
his
habitation
have
be
desert
.
<EOS>
the
place
be
curse
.
<EOS>
so
much
odium
attach
to
it,—so
many
fearful
tale
be
tell
of
it,—that
no
one
would
dwell
there
.
<EOS>
at
the
time
of
its
owner
's
committal
,
it
be
strip
of
all
its
content
,
and
nothing
be
leave
but
bare
wall
and
uncovered
floor
.
<EOS>
even
these
,
from
neglect
and
desertion
,
have
become
dilapidated
,
and
a
dreary
and
more
desolate
place
could
not
be
imagine
.
<EOS>
strict
search
have
be
make
by
the
officer
of
the
Star
-
Chamber
for
conceal
treasure
,
but
little
be
find
,
the
bulk
have
be
carry
off
,
as
before
relate
,
by
the
myrmidon
.
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
it
be
suppose
there
be
other
secret
hoard
,
if
a
clue
to
them
could
only
be
find
.
<EOS>
Mompesson
have
be
interrogate
on
the
subject
;
but
he
only
make
answer
calculate
to
excite
the
cupidity
of
his
hearer
without
satisfy
them
,
and
they
fancy
he
be
deceive
them
.
<EOS>
on
the
night
in
question
,
to
all
outward
appearance
,
the
house
be
sombre
and
desert
as
usual
,
and
the
city
watch
who
pass
it
at
midnight
,
and
pause
before
its
rusty
gate
and
its
nail
-
up
door
,
fancy
all
be
secure
.
<EOS>
the
moon
be
at
the
full
,
shine
brightly
on
the
sombre
stone
wall
of
the
mansion,—on
its
window
,
and
on
the
lofty
corner
turret
,
whence
Mompesson
use
so
often
to
reconnoitre
the
captive
in
the
opposite
prison
;
and
,
as
certain
of
the
guard
look
up
at
the
turret
,
they
laugh
at
its
present
emptiness
.
<EOS>
yet
they
little
dream
who
be
there
at
the
time
,
regard
them
from
the
narrow
loop
-
hole
.
<EOS>
after
the
pause
of
a
few
minute
they
move
on
,
and
the
gleam
of
their
halbert
be
presently
see
,
as
they
cross
Fleet
Bridge
,
and
march
towards
Ludgate
.
<EOS>
about
two
hour
afterwards
the
watch
re
-
appear
,
and
,
while
again
pass
the
house
,
the
attention
of
their
leader
be
attract
by
an
unusual
appearance
in
the
masonry
near
the
north
-
east
angle
,
above
which
the
tall
turret
be
situate
.
<EOS>
on
close
examination
,
the
irregularity
in
the
wall
be
find
to
be
produce
by
a
small
secret
door
,
which
be
leave
partially
open
,
as
if
it
have
be
recently
use
.
<EOS>
the
suspicion
of
the
party
be
arouse
by
this
singular
circumstance
(
none
of
them
have
be
aware
of
the
existence
of
such
a
door
)
,
they
at
once
enter
the
house
,
resolve
to
make
strict
search
throughout
it
.
<EOS>
in
the
first
instance
,
they
scale
the
turret
,
with
which
the
secret
outlet
communicate
by
a
narrow
winding
staircase
;
and
then
,
proceed
to
the
interior
of
the
habitation
,
pursue
their
investigation
for
some
time
without
success
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
they
be
just
about
to
depart
,
when
a
sound
resemble
a
deep
groan
seem
to
arise
from
the
cellar
which
they
have
not
visit
.
<EOS>
hear
this
,
they
immediately
rush
down
,
and
make
an
extraordinary
discovery
.
<EOS>
to
explain
this
,
however
,
we
must
go
back
to
the
time
when
they
first
pass
the
house
.
<EOS>
We
then
mention
that
there
be
a
person
in
the
turret
watch
their
movement
.
<EOS>
as
they
disappear
in
the
direction
of
Ludgate
,
this
individual
quit
his
post
of
observation
,
and
,
descend
the
spiral
staircase
,
thread
a
long
passage
in
the
darkness
,
like
one
familiar
with
the
place
,
until
he
arrive
at
a
particular
chamber
,
which
he
enter
;
and
,
without
pause
,
proceed
to
a
little
cabinet
beyond
it
.
<EOS>
the
moonlight
stream
through
a
grate
window
,
show
that
this
cabinet
have
be
completely
dismantle
;
stone
have
be
remove
from
the
wall
;
and
several
of
the
board
compose
the
floor
,
have
be
tear
up
and
never
replace
.
<EOS>
the
intruder
do
not
pass
beyond
the
door
,
but
,
after
gaze
for
a
few
minute
at
the
scene
of
ruin
,
utter
an
ejaculation
of
rage
,
and
retire
.
<EOS>
His
step
may
have
be
next
hear
descend
the
great
stone
staircase
.
<EOS>
He
pause
not
a
moment
within
the
entrance
-
hall
,
but
make
his
way
along
a
side
passage
on
the
left
,
and
down
another
flight
of
step
,
till
he
reach
a
subterranean
chamber
.
<EOS>
here
all
would
have
be
profound
obscurity
,
have
it
not
be
for
a
lamp
set
on
the
ground
,
which
imperfectly
illumine
the
place
.
<EOS>
as
the
man
take
up
the
lamp
and
trim
it
,
the
light
fall
strongly
upon
his
feature
,
and
reveal
all
their
hideousness
.
<EOS>
no
visage
,
except
that
of
Osmond
Mounchensey
,
could
be
more
appalling
than
this
person
's
,
and
the
mutilation
be
in
both
case
the
same
.
<EOS>
It
be
needless
to
say
it
be
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
His
habiliment
be
sordid
;
and
his
beard
and
hair
,
grizzle
by
suffer
rather
than
age
,
be
wild
and
disorder
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
arm
both
with
sword
and
dagger
;
and
his
limb
look
muscular
and
active
as
ever
.
<EOS>
cast
a
glance
towards
the
entrance
of
the
vault
as
if
to
make
quite
sure
he
be
not
observe
—
though
he
entertain
little
anxiety
on
that
score
—
Mompesson
step
towards
a
particular
part
of
the
wall
,
and
touch
a
spring
,
a
secret
door
(
not
to
be
detect
within
the
masonry
except
on
minute
examination
)
fly
open
,
and
disclose
another
and
small
vault
.
<EOS>
here
,
it
be
at
once
evident
,
be
conceal
the
treasure
that
have
escape
the
clutch
of
the
myrmidon
and
the
officer
of
the
Star
-
Chamber
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
large
open
chest
at
the
further
end
,
full
of
corpulent
money
-
bag
,
any
one
of
which
would
have
gladden
the
heart
of
a
miser
.
<EOS>
on
this
chest
Mompesson
's
gaze
be
so
greedily
fix
that
he
do
not
notice
the
body
of
a
man
lie
directly
in
his
path
,
and
well
-
nigh
stumble
over
it
.
<EOS>
utter
a
bitter
imprecation
,
he
hold
down
the
lamp
,
and
beheld
the
countenance
of
Luke
Hatton
,
now
rigid
in
death
,
but
with
the
sardonic
grin
it
have
wear
throughout
life
still
impressed
upon
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
deep
gash
in
the
breast
of
the
dead
man
,
and
blood
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
"accurse
<EOS>
spy
and
traitor
,
"
cry
Mompesson
,
as
he
take
hold
of
the
body
by
the
heel
and
drag
it
to
one
corner—"thou
wilt
<EOS>
never
betray
me
more
.
<EOS>
what
bring
thee
here
<EOS>
I
know
not
,
unless
it
be
to
meet
the
death
thou
hast
merit
at
my
hand
.
<EOS>
Would
a
like
chance
may
bring
Osmond
Mounchensey
here
—
and
alone
—
I
would
desire
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
""Be
thy
wish
gratify
then
!
"
cry
a
voice
,
which
Mompesson
could
not
mistake
.
<EOS>
look
up
,
he
behold
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
in
an
instant
his
hand
be
upon
his
sword
,
and
the
blade
gleam
in
the
lamp
-
light
.
<EOS>
Osmond
have
likewise
pluck
forth
his
rapier
,
and
hold
a
poignard
in
his
left
hand
.
<EOS>
for
a
few
moment
they
gaze
at
each
other
with
terrible
look
,
their
breast
animate
with
an
intensity
of
hatred
which
only
mortal
foe
,
meet
under
such
circumstance
,
can
feel
.
<EOS>
so
fiercely
bloodthirsty
be
their
look
that
their
disfigure
feature
seem
to
have
lose
all
trace
of
humanity
.
<EOS>
"Yield
<EOS>
thee
,
murtherous
villain
,
"
cry
Osmond
at
length
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
drag
thee
to
the
hangman
.
<EOS>
""call
in
thy
fellow
,
and
thou
shalt
see
whether
I
will
yield
,
"
rejoin
Mompesson
,
with
a
laugh
of
defiance
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
none
at
my
back
,
"
rejoin
Osmond
;
"
I
will
force
thee
to
follow
me
alone!""Thou
art
alone
then
!
"
<EOS>
roar
Mompesson
;
"
that
be
all
I
desired!"and
,
without
a
word
more
,
he
commence
the
attack
.
<EOS>
during
the
brief
colloquy
just
detail
,
he
have
notice
that
his
enemy
be
doubly
armed
,
and
before
begin
the
conflict
he
draw
his
own
dagger
,
so
that
there
be
no
great
advantage
on
one
side
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
both
be
admirable
swordsman
,
and
in
strength
they
be
nearly
match
;
but
the
combat
be
conduct
with
a
ferocity
that
almost
set
skill
at
defiance
.
<EOS>
after
the
exchange
of
a
few
desperate
pass
,
they
close
;
and
in
the
terrific
struggle
that
ensue
the
lamp
be
extinguish
.
<EOS>
the
profound
darkness
prevent
them
from
see
the
frightful
wound
they
inflict
on
each
other
;
but
both
know
they
be
severely
hurt
,
though
each
hope
he
be
not
so
much
injure
as
his
adversary
.
<EOS>
exhausted
,
at
length
,
by
loss
of
blood
,
and
ready
to
drop
,
they
release
each
other
by
mutual
consent
;
and
,
after
make
a
few
more
feeble
and
ineffectual
thrust
,
lean
upon
their
sword
for
support
.
<EOS>
"Wilt
<EOS>
thou
yield
now
,
villain
?
<EOS>
"
demand
Osmond
,
in
a
hoarse
voice
.
"
<EOS>
or
must
I
finish
thee
outright?""finish
me
!
"
<EOS>
echo
Mompesson
,
in
tone
equally
hoarse
.
<EOS>
"
strike
another
blow
against
me
if
thou
canst
.
<EOS>
but
I
well
know
thou
art
speed
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
recover
breath
,
I
will
make
short
work
with
thee
.
<EOS>
""About
<EOS>
it
quickly
,
then
,
"
rejoin
Osmond
:
"
<EOS>
I
be
ready
for
thee
.
<EOS>
but
thy
boast
be
idle
.
<EOS>
Thou
art
bleed
to
death
.
<EOS>
twice
have
my
poignard
pierce
thy
breast
.
<EOS>
""Thou
wilt
never
use
thy
poignard
again
.
<EOS>
Thy
left
arm
be
disabled
,
"
rejoin
mompesson—"beside
,
my
sword
pass
through
thee
almost
to
the
hilt
.
<EOS>
""It
glance
from
my
doublet
:
I
scarcely
feel
the
scratch
.
<EOS>
""'Twas
<EOS>
a
scratch
deep
enough
to
let
thy
life
-
blood
out
.
<EOS>
but
since
thou
hast
more
to
be
spilt
,
have
at
thee
again!""Where
art
thou
?
"
cry
Osmond
,
stagger
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"Here
!
"
rejoin
Mompesson
,
avoid
the
thrust
make
at
him
,
and
deal
one
in
return
that
stretch
his
adversary
lifeless
at
his
foot
.
<EOS>
in
the
exultation
of
the
moment
,
he
forget
his
own
desperate
condition
,
and
,
with
a
fierce
,
triumphant
laugh
,
set
his
foot
upon
the
body
of
his
prostrate
foe
.
<EOS>
but
a
mortal
faintness
seize
him
.
<EOS>
He
essay
to
quit
the
vault
—
but
it
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
His
strength
be
utterly
go
.
<EOS>
with
an
irrepressible
groan
,
he
fall
to
the
ground
,
close
beside
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
there
they
lay
,
the
dying
and
the
dead
,
for
more
than
an
hour
.
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
that
time
,
they
be
discover
by
the
watch
.
<EOS>
Mompesson
yet
breathe
;
and
as
the
torch
-
light
fall
upon
the
scene
of
horror
,
he
slightly
raise
his
head
,
and
point
to
his
slaughter
adversary
,
with
a
ghastly
smile
,
expire
.

the
end
