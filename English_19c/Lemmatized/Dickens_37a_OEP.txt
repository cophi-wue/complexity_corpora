the
Bashful
Young
Gentleman
    
<EOS>
We
find
ourself
seat
at
a
small
dinner
party
the
other
day
,
opposite
a
stranger
of
such
singular
appearance
and
manner
,
that
he
irresistibly
attract
our
attention
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
fresh
-
coloured
young
gentleman
,
with
as
good
a
promise
of
light
whisker
as
one
may
wish
to
see
,
and
possess
of
a
very
velvet
-
like
,
soft
-
look
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
not
use
the
latter
term
invidiously
,
but
merely
to
denote
a
pair
of
smooth
,
plump
,
highly
-
coloured
cheek
of
capacious
dimension
,
and
a
mouth
rather
remarkable
for
the
fresh
hue
of
the
lip
than
for
any
marked
or
striking
expression
it
present
.
 
<EOS>
His
whole
face
be
suffuse
with
a
crimson
blush
,
and
bear
that
downcast
,
timid
,
retire
look
,
which
betoken
a
man
ill
at
ease
with
himself
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
in
these
symptom
to
attract
more
than
a
pass
remark
,
but
our
attention
have
be
originally
draw
to
the
bashful
young
gentleman
,
on
his
first
appearance
in
the
drawing
-
room
above
-
stair
,
into
which
he
be
no
sooner
introduce
,
than
make
his
way
towards
us
who
be
stand
in
a
window
,
and
wholly
neglect
several
person
who
warmly
accost
him
,
he
seize
our
hand
with
visible
emotion
,
and
press
it
with
a
convulsive
grasp
for
a
good
couple
of
minute
,
after
which
he
dive
in
a
nervous
manner
across
the
room
,
overset
in
his
way
a
fine
little
girl
of
six
year
and
a
quarter
old
---
and
shroud
himself
behind
some
hanging
,
be
see
no
more
,
until
the
eagle
eye
of
the
hostess
detect
him
in
his
concealment
,
on
the
announcement
of
dinner
,
he
be
request
to
pair
off
with
a
lively
single
lady
,
of
two
or
three
and
thirty
.
  
<EOS>
this
most
flattering
salutation
from
a
perfect
stranger
,
would
have
gratify
us
not
a
little
as
a
token
of
his
have
hold
us
in
high
respect
,
and
for
that
reason
be
desirous
of
our
acquaintance
,
if
we
have
not
suspect
from
the
first
,
that
the
young
gentleman
,
in
make
a
desperate
effort
to
get
through
the
ceremony
of
introduction
,
have
,
in
the
bewilderment
of
his
idea
,
shake
hand
with
us
at
random
.
 
<EOS>
this
impression
be
fully
confirm
by
the
subsequent
behaviour
of
the
bashful
young
gentleman
in
question
,
which
we
note
particularly
,
with
the
view
of
ascertain
whether
we
be
right
in
our
conjecture
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
seat
himself
at
table
with
evident
misgiving
,
and
turn
sharp
round
to
pay
attention
to
some
observation
of
his
loquacious
neighbour
,
overset
his
bread
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
very
bad
in
this
,
and
if
he
have
have
the
presence
of
mind
to
let
it
go
,
and
say
nothing
about
it
,
nobody
but
the
man
who
have
lay
the
cloth
would
have
be
a
bit
the
wise
;
but
the
young
gentleman
in
various
semi
-
successful
attempt
to
prevent
its
fall
,
play
with
it
a
little
,
as
gentleman
in
the
street
may
be
see
to
do
with
their
hat
on
a
windy
day
,
and
then
give
the
roll
a
smart
rap
in
his
anxiety
to
catch
it
,
knock
it
with
great
adroitness
into
a
tureen
of
white
soup
at
some
distance
,
to
the
unspeakable
terror
and
disturbance
of
a
very
amiable
bald
gentleman
,
who
be
dispense
the
content
.
 
<EOS>
We
think
the
bashful
young
gentleman
would
have
go
off
in
an
apoplectic
fit
,
consequent
upon
the
violent
rush
of
blood
to
his
face
at
the
occurrence
of
this
catastrophe
.
  
<EOS>
from
this
moment
we
perceive
,
in
the
phraseology
of
the
fancy
,
that
it
be
"
all
up
"
with
the
bashful
young
gentleman
,
and
so
indeed
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
several
benevolent
person
endeavour
to
relieve
his
embarrassment
by
take
wine
with
him
,
but
find
that
it
only
augment
his
suffering
,
and
that
after
mingle
sherry
,
champagne
,
hock
,
and
moselle
together
,
he
apply
the
great
part
of
the
mixture
externally
,
instead
of
internally
,
they
gradually
drop
off
,
and
leave
him
to
the
exclusive
care
of
the
talkative
lady
,
who
,
not
note
the
wildness
of
his
eye
,
firmly
believe
she
have
secure
a
listener
.
 
<EOS>
He
break
a
glass
or
two
in
the
course
of
the
meal
,
and
disappear
shortly
afterwards
;
it
be
infer
that
he
go
away
in
some
confusion
,
inasmuch
as
he
leave
the
house
in
another
gentleman
's
coat
,
and
the
footman
's
hat
.
  
<EOS>
this
little
incident
lead
us
to
reflect
upon
the
most
prominent
characteristic
of
bashful
young
gentleman
in
the
abstract
;
and
as
this
portable
volume
will
be
the
great
text
-
book
of
young
lady
in
all
future
generation
,
we
record
them
here
for
their
guidance
and
behoof
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
bashful
young
gentleman
,
in
turn
a
street
corner
,
chance
to
stumble
suddenly
upon
two
or
three
young
lady
of
his
acquaintance
,
nothing
can
exceed
his
confusion
and
agitation
.
 
<EOS>
His
first
impulse
be
to
make
a
great
variety
of
bow
,
and
dart
past
them
,
which
he
do
until
,
observe
that
they
wish
to
stop
,
but
be
uncertain
whether
to
do
so
or
not
<EOS>
,
he
make
several
feint
of
return
,
which
cause
them
to
do
the
same
;
and
at
length
,
after
a
great
quantity
of
unnecessary
dodging
and
fall
up
against
the
other
passenger
,
he
return
and
shake
hand
most
affectionately
with
all
of
them
,
in
do
which
he
knock
out
of
their
grasp
sundry
little
parcel
,
which
he
hastily
pick
up
,
and
return
very
muddy
and
disorder
.
 
<EOS>
the
chance
be
that
the
bashful
young
gentleman
then
observe
it
be
very
fine
weather
,
and
be
remind
that
it
have
only
just
leave
off
rain
for
the
first
time
these
three
day
,
he
blush
very
much
,
and
smile
as
if
he
have
say
a
very
good
thing
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
lady
who
be
most
anxious
to
speak
,
here
inquire
,
with
an
air
of
great
commiseration
,
how
his
dear
sister
Harriet
be
to
-
day
;
to
which
the
young
gentleman
,
without
the
slight
consideration
,
reply
with
many
thank
,
that
she
be
remarkably
well
.
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
Mr
Hopkins
!
<EOS>
"
cry
the
young
lady
,
"
why
,
we
hear
she
be
bleed
yesterday
evening
,
and
have
be
perfectly
miserable
about
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
ah
,
"
say
the
young
gentleman
,
"
<EOS>
so
she
be
.
 
<EOS>
oh
,
she
be
very
ill
,
very
ill
indeed
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
then
shake
his
head
,
and
look
very
desponding
(
he
have
be
smile
perpetually
up
to
this
time
)
,
and
after
a
short
pause
,
give
his
glove
a
great
wrench
at
the
wrist
,
and
say
,
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
adjective
,
"
<EOS>
good
morning
,
good
morning
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
make
a
great
number
of
bow
in
acknowledgment
of
several
little
message
to
his
sister
,
walk
backward
a
few
pace
,
and
come
with
great
violence
against
a
lamp
-
post
,
knock
his
hat
off
in
the
contact
,
which
in
his
mental
confusion
and
bodily
pain
he
be
go
to
walk
away
without
,
until
a
great
roar
from
a
carter
attract
his
attention
,
when
he
pick
it
up
,
and
try
to
smile
cheerfully
to
the
young
lady
,
who
be
look
back
,
and
who
,
he
have
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
,
be
all
laugh
heartily
.
  
<EOS>
at
a
quadrille
party
,
the
bashful
young
gentleman
always
remain
as
near
the
entrance
of
the
room
as
possible
,
from
which
position
he
smile
at
the
people
he
know
as
they
come
in
,
and
sometimes
step
forward
to
shake
hand
with
more
intimate
friend
:
 
a
process
which
on
each
repetition
seem
to
turn
him
a
deep
scarlet
than
before
.
<EOS>
He
decline
dance
the
first
set
or
two
,
observe
,
in
a
faint
voice
,
that
he
would
rather
wait
a
little
;
but
at
length
be
absolutely
compel
to
allow
himself
to
be
introduce
to
a
partner
,
when
he
be
lead
,
in
a
great
heat
and
blush
furiously
,
across
the
room
to
a
spot
where
half
-
a
-
dozen
unknown
lady
be
congregate
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Lambert
,
let
me
introduce
Mr
Hopkins
for
the
next
quadrille
.
"
 
<EOS>
Miss
Lambert
incline
her
head
graciously
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Hopkins
bow
,
and
his
fair
conductress
disappear
,
leave
Mr
Hopkins
,
as
he
too
well
know
,
to
make
himself
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
the
young
lady
more
than
half
expect
that
the
bashful
young
gentleman
will
say
something
,
and
the
bashful
young
gentleman
feel
this
,
seriously
think
whether
he
have
get
anything
to
say
,
which
,
upon
mature
reflection
,
he
be
rather
disposed
to
conclude
he
have
not
,
since
nothing
occur
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
the
young
lady
,
after
several
inspection
of
her
BOUQUET
,
all
make
in
the
expectation
that
the
bashful
young
gentleman
be
go
to
talk
,
whisper
her
mamma
,
who
be
sit
next
her
,
which
whisper
the
bashful
young
gentleman
immediately
suspect
(
and
possibly
with
very
good
reason
)
must
be
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
in
this
comfortable
condition
he
remain
until
it
be
time
to
"
stand
up
,
"
when
murmur
a
<EOS>
"
Will
you
allow
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
give
the
young
lady
his
arm
,
and
after
inquire
where
she
will
stand
,
and
receive
a
reply
that
she
have
no
choice
,
conduct
her
to
the
remote
corner
of
the
quadrille
,
and
make
one
attempt
at
conversation
,
which
turn
out
a
desperate
failure
,
preserve
a
profound
silence
until
it
be
all
over
,
when
he
walk
her
twice
round
the
room
,
deposit
her
in
her
old
seat
,
and
retire
in
confusion
.

sometimes
;
how
it
be

be
a

to
us
---
a

either
cause
his

to
appear
bold
by
contrast

merge
her

importance
in
his

while

beauty
and

retain
their

to

.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
commence
with
the
former
,
because
that
specie
come
more
frequently
under
the
notice
of
young
lady
,
whom
it
be
our
province

a
city
counting

in

he
do
as
little
as
he
possibly
can
:
 
his
chief
place
of
resort
be
,
the
street
,
the
tavern
,
and
the
theatre
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
street
at
evening
time
,
out

and

out
young

have
a
pleasant
custom
of
walk
six
or
eight
abreast
,
thus
drive
female
and
other
inoffensive
person
into
the
road
,
which
never
fail
to
afford
them
the
high
satisfaction
,
especially
if
there
be
any
immediate
danger
of
their
be
run
over
,
which
enhance
the
fun
of
the

materially
.
 
<EOS>
in
all
place
of
public
resort
,
the
out

be
careful
to
select
each
a
seat
to
himself
,
upon

he
lie
at
full
length
,
and
(
if
the
weather
be
very
dirty
,
but
not
in
any
other
case
)
he
lie
with
his
knee
up
,
and
the
sol
of
his
boot
plant
firmly
on
the
cushion
,
so
that
if
any
low

should
ask

he
take
ample
revenge
upon

in

air
while
the
play

with
a
dignified
contempt
of

performance
;
if
it
be
possible
for
one
or
two
out

out
young
gentleman
to
get
up
a
little
crowding
in
the
passage

they
be
quite
in
their
element
,
squeeze
,
push
,
whooping
,
and
shout
in
the
most
humorous
manner
possible

<EOS>
if

can
only
succeed
in
irritate
the
gentleman
who
have
a
family
of
daughter
under

they
be
like
to
die
with
laughing
,
and
boast
of
it
among
their
companion
for
a
week
afterwards
,
add
,
that
one
or
two
of
them
be
"
devilish
fine
girl
,
"
and
that
they
really
think
the
young
would
have
faint
,
which
be
the
only
thing
want
to
render
the
joke
complete

<EOS>
if
the

out
young

have
a
mother

sister
,
of

he
treat
them
with
become
contempt
,
inasmuch
as
they
(
poor
thing
!
)
<EOS>
have
no
notion
of
life
or
gaiety
,
be
far
too
weak

spirited
and
mope
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
sometimes
,
however
,
on
a
birth
-
day
or
at
Christmas

time
,
he
can
not
very
well
help
accompany
them
to
a
party
at
some
old
friend

,
<EOS>
with
which
view
he
come
home
when

dress
an
hour
or
two
,
smell
very
strongly
of
tobacco
and
spirit
,
and
after
exchange
his
rough
coat
for
some
more
suitable
attire
(
in
which
however
he
lose
nothing
of
the
out

outer
)
,
get
into
the
coach
and
grumble
all
the
way
at
his
own
good
nature
:
 
his
bitter
reflection
aggravate
by
the
recollection
,
that
Tom
Smith
have
take
the
chair
at
a
little
impromptu
dinner
at
a
fighting
man

,
and
that
a
set

to
be
to
take
place
on
a
dining

table
,
between
the
fighting
man
and
his
brother
-
in

law
,
which
be
probably
"
come
off
"
at
that
very
instant
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
out
-
and
-
out
young
gentleman
be
by
no
mean
at
his
ease
in
lady
'
society
,
he
shrink
into
a
corner
of
the
drawing
-
room
when
they
reach
the
friend
's
,
and
unless
one
of
his
sister
be
kind
enough
to
talk
to
him
,
remain
there
without
be
much
trouble
by
the
attention
of
other
people
,
until
he
espy
,
linger
outside
the
door
,
another
gentleman
,
whom
he
at
once
know
,
by
his
air
and
manner
<EOS>
(
for
there
be
a
kind
of
free

masonry
in
the
craft
)
,
to
be
a
brother
out

and

outer
,
and
towards
whom
he
accordingly
make
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
conversation
be
soon
open
by
some
casual
remark
,
the
second
out
-
and
-
outer
confidentially
inform
the
first
,
that
he
be
one
of
the
rough
sort
and
hate
that
kind
of
thing
,
only
he
could
not
very
well
be
off
come
;
to
which
the
other
reply
,
that
that
be
just
his
case
---
"
<EOS>
and
I
will
tell
you
<EOS>
what

"
continue
the

outer
in
a
whisper

"
I
should
like
a
glass

<EOS>
the
discovery
be
at

make
that

each
of
them
say
at
the

moment
,
that
he
see
the

understand
what
be
what
:
 
<EOS>
and
they
become
fast
friend
at
once
,
more
especially
when
it
appear
,
that
the
second
out

and

outer
be
no
other
than
a
gentleman
,
long
favourably
known
to
his
familiar
as
"
Mr
Warmint
Blake
,
"
who
upon
diver
occasion
have
distinguish
himself
in
a
manner
that
would
not
have
disgrace
the
fighting
man
,
and
who

have
be
a
pretty
long
time
about
town
---
have
the
honour
of
once
shake
hand
with
the
celebrated
Mr
Thurtell
himself
.
  
<EOS>
at
supper
,
these
gentleman
greatly
distinguish
themselves
,
brighten
up
very
much
when
the
lady
leave
the
table
,
and
proclaim
aloud
their
intention
of
begin
to
spend
the
evening
---
a
process
which
be
generally
understand
to
be
satisfactorily
perform
,
when
a
great
deal
of
wine
be
drunk
and
a
great
deal
of
noise
make
,
both
of
which
feat
the
out

and

out
young
gentleman
execute
to
perfection
.
 
<EOS>
have
protract
their
sitting
until
long
after
the
host
and
the
other
guest
have
adjourn
to
the
drawing

room
,
and
find
that
they
have
drain
the
decanter
empty
,
they
follow
them
thither
with
complexion
rather
heighten
,
and
face
rather
bloated
with
wine
;
and
the
agitated
lady
of
the
house
whisper
her
friend
as
they
waltz
together
,
to
the
great
terror
of
the
whole
room
,
that
"
both
Mr
Blake
and
Mr
Dummins
be
very
nice
sort
of
young
man
in
their
way

only
they

nobody

these

without

distinguish
by
all
the

amiable

attractive

in

great

now

find
their

through

home

gentlemanly

clever

we

of

Young

We

so
many
specimen
of
this
class

that
in
select
the
few
head
our
limit
enable
us
to
take
from
a
great
number
,
we
have
be
induce
to
give
the
very
friendly
young
gentleman
the
preference
over
many
other
,
to
whose
claim
upon
a
more
cursory
view
of
the
question
we
have
feel
dispose
to
assign
the
priority
.
  
<EOS>
the
very
friendly
young
gentleman
be
very
friendly
to
everybody
,
but
he
attach
himself
particularly
to
two
,
or
at
most
to
three
family
:
 
regulate
his
choice
by
their
dinner
,
their
circle
of
acquaintance
,
or
some
other
criterion
in
which
he
have
an
immediate
interest
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
of
any
age
between
twenty
and
forty
,
unmarried
of
course
,
must
be
fond
of
child
,
and
be
expect
to
make
himself
generally
useful
if
possible
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
illustrate
our
meaning
by
an
example
,
which
be
the
short
mode
and
the
clear
.
  
<EOS>
We
encounter
one
day
,
by
chance
,
an
old
friend
of
whom
we
have
lose
sight
for
some
year
,
and
who
---
express
a
strong
anxiety
to
renew
our
former
intimacy
---
urge
us
to
dine
with
him
on
an
early
day
,
that
we
may
talk
over
old
time
.
 
<EOS>
We
readily
assent
,
add
,
that
we
hope
we
should
be
alone
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
certainly
,
certainly
,
"
say
our
friend
,
"
not
a
soul
with
us
but
Mincin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
and
who
be
Mincin
?
"
be
our
natural
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
"
o
do
not
mind
him
,
"
reply
our
friend
,
"
he
be
a
most
particular
friend
of
mine
,
and
a
very
friendly
fellow
you
will
find
him
;
"
and
so
he
leave
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
think
no
more
about
Mincin
until
we
duly
present
ourselves
at
the
house
next
day
,
when
,
after
a
hearty
welcome
,
our
friend
motion
towards
a
gentleman
who
have
be
previously
show
his
tooth
by
the
fireplace
,
and
give
us
to
understand
that
it
be
Mr
Mincin
,
of
whom
he
have
speak
.
 
<EOS>
It
require
no
great
penetration
on
our
part
to
discover
at
once
that
Mr
Mincin
be
in
every
respect
a
very
friendly
young
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
delighted
,
"
say
Mincin
,
hastily
advance
,
and
press
our
hand
warmly
between
both
of
his
,
"
I
be
delighted
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
,
to
make
your
acquaintance
---
(
here
he
smile
)
---
very
much
delighted
indeed
---
(
here
he
exhibit
a
little
emotion
)
---
I
assure
you
that
I
have
look
forward
to
it
anxiously
for
a
very
long
time
:
"
here
he
release
our
hand
,
and
rub
his
own
,
observe
,
that
the
day
be
severe
,
but
that
he
be
delighted
to
perceive
from
our
appearance
that
it
agree
with
us
wonderfully
;
and
then
go
on
to
observe
,
that
,
notwithstanding
the
coldness
of
the
weather
,
he
have
that
morning
see
in
the
paper
an
exceedingly
curious
paragraph
,
to
the
effect
,
that
there
be
now
in
the
garden
of
Mr
Wilkins
of
Chichester
,
a
pumpkin
,
measure
four
foot
in
height
,
and
eleven
foot
seven
inch
in
circumference
,
which
he
look
upon
as
a
very
extraordinary
piece
of
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
We
venture
to
remark
,
that
we
have
a
dim
recollection
of
have
once
or
twice
before
observe
a
similar
paragraph
in
the
public
print
,
upon
which
Mr
Mincin
take
us
confidentially
by
the
button
,
and
say
,
<EOS>
exactly
,
exactly
,
to
be
sure
,
we
be
very
right
,
and
he
wonder
what
the
editor
mean
by
put
in
such
thing
.
 
<EOS>
who
the
deuce
,
he
should
like
to
know
,
do
they
suppose
care
about
them
?
<EOS>
that
strike
him
as
be
the
good
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
of
the
house
appear
shortly
afterwards
,
and
Mr
Mincin
's
friendliness
,
as
will
readily
be
suppose
,
suffer
no
diminution
in
consequence
;
he
exert
much
strength
and
skill
in
wheel
a
large
easy
-
chair
up
to
the
fire
,
and
the
lady
be
seat
in
it
,
carefully
close
the
door
,
stir
the
fire
,
and
look
to
the
window
to
see
that
they
admit
no
air
;
have
satisfy
himself
upon
all
these
point
,
he
express
himself
quite
easy
in
his
mind
,
and
beg
to
know
how
she
find
herself
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
upon
the
lady
's
reply
very
well
,
Mr
Mincin
(
who
it
appear
be
a
medical
gentleman
)
offer
some
general
remark
upon
the
nature
and
treatment
of
cold
in
the
head
,
which
occupy
us
agreeably
until
dinner
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
during
the
meal
,
he
devote
himself
to
compliment
everybody
,
not
forget
himself
,
so
that
we
be
an
uncommonly
agreeable
quartette
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
what
,
Capper
,
"
say
Mr
Mincin
to
our
host
,
as
he
close
the
room
door
after
the
lady
have
retire
,
"

very
great
reason
to
be
fond
of

"
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Mincin
---
I
beg

"
interpose
the
host
,
as
we
be
about
to
reply
that
Mrs
Capper
unquestionably
be
particularly
sweet
.
<EOS>
"
pray
,
Mincin
,
do
not
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
why
not
?
"
exclaim
Mr
Mincin
,
"

<EOS>
why
should

delicacy
before

if
I
may
be
allow
to
call
you
so

"
 
<EOS>
We
of
course
wish
to
know
why
he
should
also
,
upon
which
our
friend
admit
that
Mrs
Capper
be
a
very
sweet
woman
,
at
which
admission
Mr
Mincin

"
Bravo

"
and
beg
to
propose
Mrs

with
heartfelt
enthusiasm
,
whereupon

less
than
fourteen
time
in
a

and
a
half

he
consider
no
common
circumstance
---
an
opinion
to
which
we
most
cordially
subscribe
.
  
<EOS>
now
that
we
three
be
leave
to
entertain
ourselves
with
conversation
,
Mr
Mincin
's
extreme
friendliness
become
every
moment
more
apparent
;
he
be
so
amazingly
friendly
,
indeed
,
that
it
be
impossible
to
talk
about
anything
in
which
he
have
not
the
chief
concern
.
 
<EOS>
We
happen
to
allude
to
some
affair
in
which
our
friend
and
we
have
be
mutually
engage
nearly
fourteen
year
before
,
when
Mr
Mincin
be
all
at
once
remind
of
a
joke
which
our
friend
have
make
on
that
day
four
year
,
which
he
positively
must
insist
upon
tell
---
and
which
he
do
tell
accordingly
,
with
many
pleasant
recollection
of
what
he
say
,
and
what
Mrs
Capper
say
,
and
how
he
well
remember
that
they
have
be
to
the
play
with
order
on
the
very
night
previous
,
and
have
see
Romeo
and
Juliet
,
and
the
pantomime
,
and
how
Mrs
Capper
be
faint
have
be
lead
into
the
lobby
,
where
she
smile
,
say
it
be
nothing
after
all
,
and
go
back
again
,
with
many
other
interesting
and
absorbing
particular
:
after
which
the
friendly
young
gentleman
go
on
to
assure
us
,
that
our
friend
have
experience
a
marvellously
prophetic
opinion
of
that
same
pantomime
,
which
be
of
such
an
admirable
kind
,
that
two
morning
paper
take
the
same
view
next
day
:
 
to
this
our
friend
reply
,
with
a
little
triumph
,
that
in
that
instance
he
have
some
reason
to
think
he
have
be
correct
,
which
give
the
friendly
young
gentleman
occasion
to
believe
that
our
friend
be
always
correct
;
and
so
we
go
on
,
until
our
friend
,
fill
a
bumper
,
<EOS>
say
he
must
drink
one
glass
to
his
dear
friend
Mincin
,
than
whom
he
would
say
no
man
save
the
life
of
his
acquaintance
more
,
or
have
a
more
friendly
heart
.
 
<EOS>
finally
,
our
friend
have
empty
his
glass
,
say
,
"
God
bless
you
,
Mincin
,
"
---
and
Mr
Mincin
<EOS>
and
he
shake
hand
across
the
table
with
much
affection
and
earnestness
.
  
<EOS>
but
great
as
the
friendly
young
gentleman
be
,
in
a
limited
scene
like
this
,
he
play
the
same
part
on
a
large
scale
with
increase
ECLAT
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Mincin
be
invite
to
an
evening
party
with
his
dear
friend
the
Martins
,
where
he
meet
his
dear
friend
the
Cappers
,
and
his
dear
friend
the
watson
,
and
a
hundred
other
dear
friend
too
numerous
to
mention
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
as
much
at
home
with
the
Martins
as
with
the
capper
;
but
how
exquisitely
he
balance
his
attention
,
and
divide
them
among
his
dear
friend
!
 
<EOS>
if
he
flirt
with
one
of
the
Miss
Watsons
,
he
have
one
little
Martin
on
the
sofa
pull
his
hair
,
and
the
other
little
Martin
on
the
carpet
ride
on
his
foot
.
<EOS>
He
carry
Mrs
Watson
down
to
supper
on
one
arm
,
and
Miss
Martin
on
the
other
,
and
take
wine
so
judiciously
,
and
in
such
exact
order
,
that
it
be
impossible
for
the
most
punctilious
old
lady
to
consider
herself
neglect
.
 
<EOS>
if
any
young
lady
,
be
prevail
upon
to
sing
,
become
nervous
afterwards
,
Mr
Mincin
lead
her
tenderly
into
the
next
room
,
and
restore
her
with
port
wine
,
which
she
must
take
medicinally
.
 
<EOS>
if
any
gentleman
be
stand
by
the
piano
during
the
progress
of
the
ballad
,
Mr
Mincin
seize
him
by
the
arm
at
one
point
of
the
melody
,
and
softly
beat
time
the
while
with
his
head
,
express
in
<EOS>
dumb
show
his
intense
perception
of
the
delicacy
of
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
if
anybody
's
self
-
love
be
to
be
flatter
,
Mr
Mincin
be
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
if
anybody
's
overweening
vanity
be
to
be
pamper
,
Mr
Mincin
will
surfeit
it
.
 
<EOS>
what
wonder
that
people
of
all
station
and
age
recognise
Mr
Mincin
's
friendliness
<EOS>
;
that
he
be
universally
allow
to
be
handsome
as
amiable
;
that
mother
think
him
an
oracle
,
daughter
a
dear
,
brother
a
beau
,
and
father
a
wonder
!
 
<EOS>
and
who
would
not
have
the
reputation
of
the
very
friendly
young
gentleman
?
    
<EOS>
the
Military
Young
Gentleman
    
<EOS>
We
be
rather
at
a
loss
to
imagine
how
it
have
come
to
pass
that
military
young
gentleman
have
obtain
so
much
favour
in
the
eye
of
the
young
lady
of
this
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
not
think
so
lightly
of
them
as
to
suppose
that
the
mere
circumstance
of
a
man
's
wear
a
red
coat
ensure
him
a
ready
passport
to
their
regard
;
and
even
if
this
be
the
case
,
it
would
be
no
satisfactory
explanation
of
the
circumstance
,
because
,
although
the
analogy
may
in
some
degree
hold
good
in
the
case
of
mail
coachman
and
guard
,
still
general
postman
wear
red
coat
,
and
they
be
not
to
our
knowledge
better
receive
than
other
man
;
nor
be
fireman
either
,
who
wear
(
or
use
to
wear
)
not
only
red
coat
,
but
very
resplendent
and
massive
badge
besides
---
much
large
than
epaulette
.
 
<EOS>
neither
do
the
twopenny
post
-
office
boy
,
if
the
result
of
our
inquiry
be
correct
,
find
any
peculiar
favour
in
woman
's
eye
,
although
they
wear
very
bright
red
jacket
,
and
have
the
additional
advantage
of
constantly
appear
in
public
on
horseback
,
which
last
circumstance
may
be
naturally
suppose
to
be
greatly
in
their
favour
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
sometimes
think
that
this
phenomenon
may
take
its
rise
in
the
conventional
behaviour
of
captain
and
colonel
and
other
gentleman
in
red
coat
on
the
stage
,
where
they
be
invariably
represent
as
fine
swaggering
fellow
,
talk
of
nothing
but
charming
girl
,
their
king
and
country
,
their
honour
,
and
their
debt
,
and
crow
over
the
inferior
class
of
the
community
,
whom
they
occasionally
treat
with
a
little
gentlemanly
swindle
,
no
less
to
the
improvement
and
pleasure
of
the
audience
,
than
to
the
satisfaction
and
approval
of
the
choice
spirit
who
consort
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
will
not
devote
these
page
to
our
speculation
upon
the
subject
,
inasmuch
as
our
business
at
the
present
moment
be
not
so
much
with
the
young
lady
who
be
bewitch
by
her
Majesty
's
livery
as
with
the
young
gentleman
whose
head
be
turn
by
it
.
<EOS>
for
"
head
"
we
have
write
"
brain
;
"
but
upon
consideration
,
we
think
the
former
the
more
appropriate
word
of
the
two
.
  
<EOS>
these
young
gentleman
may
be
divide
into
two
class
---
young
gentleman
who
be
actually
in
the
army
,
and
young
gentleman
who
,
have
an
intense
and
enthusiastic
admiration
for
all
thing
appertain
to
a
military
life
,
be
compel
by
adverse
fortune
or
adverse
relation
to
wear
out
their
existence
in
some
ignoble
counting
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
take
this
latter
description
of
military
young
gentleman
first
.
  
<EOS>
the
whole
heart
and
soul
of
the
military
young
gentleman
be
concentrate
in
his
favourite
topic
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
that
he
be
so
learn
upon
as
uniform
;
he
will
tell
you
,
without
falter
for
an
instant
,
what
the
habiliment
of
any
one
regiment
be
turn
up
with
,
what
regiment
wear
stripe
down
the
outside
and
inside
of
the
leg
,
and
how
many
button
the
Tenth
have
on
their
coat
;
he
know
to
a
fraction
how
many
yard
and
odd
inch
of
gold
lace
it
take
to
make
an
ensign
in
the
Guards
;
be
deeply
read
in
the
comparative
merit
of
different
band
,
and
the
apparelling
of
trumpeter
;
and
be
very
luminous
indeed
in
descant
upon
"
crack
regiment
,
"
and
the
"
crack
"
gentleman
who
compose
them
,
of
whose
mightiness
and
grandeur
he
be
never
tired
of
tell
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
suggest
to
a
military
young
gentleman
only
the
other
day
,
after
he
have
relate
to
us
several
dazzle
instance
of
the
profusion
of
half
-
a
-
dozen
honourable
ensign
somebody
or
nobody
in
the
article
of
kid
glove
and
polished
boot
,
that
possibly
"
crack
"
regiment
would
be
an
improvement
upon
"
crack
,
"
as
be
a
more
expressive
and
appropriate
designation
,
when
he
suddenly
interrupt
us
by
pull
out
his
watch
,
and
observe
that
he
must
hurry
off
to
the
Park
in
a
cab
,
or
he
would
be
too
late
to
hear
the
band
play
.
 
<EOS>
not
wish
to
interfere
with
so
important
an
engagement
,
and
be
in
fact
already
slightly
overwhelm
by
the
anecdote
of
the
honourable
ensign
afore
-
mention
,
we
make
no
attempt
to
detain
the
military
young
gentleman
,
but
part
company
with
ready
good
-
will
.
  
<EOS>
some
three
or
four
hour
afterwards
,
we
chance
to
be
walk
down
Whitehall
,
on
the
Admiralty
side
of
the
way
,
when
,
as
we
draw
near
to
one
of
the
little
stone
place
in
which
a
couple
of
horse
soldier
mount
guard
in
the
daytime
,
we
be
attract
by
the
motionless
appearance
and
eager
gaze
of
a
young
gentleman
,
who
be
devour
both
man
and
horse
with
his
eye
,
so
eagerly
,
that
he
seem
deaf
and
blind
to
all
that
be
pass
around
him
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
not
much
surprised
at
the
discovery
that
it
be
our
friend
,
the
military
young
gentleman
,
but
we
be
a
little
astonished
when
we
return
from
a
walk
to
South
Lambeth
to
find
him
still
there
,
look
on
with
the
same
intensity
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
as
it
be
a
very
windy
day
,
we
feel
bind
to
awaken
the
young
gentleman
from
his
reverie
,
when
he
inquire
of
us
with
great
enthusiasm
,
whether
"
that
be
not
a
glorious
spectacle
,
"
and
proceed
to
give
us
a
detailed
account
of
the
weight
of
every
article
of
the
spectacle
's
trapping
,
from
the
man
's
glove
to
the
horse
's
shoe
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
make
it
a
practice
since
,
to
take
the
Horse
Guards
in
our
daily
walk
,
and
we
find
it
be
the
custom
of
military
young
gentleman
to
plant
themselves
opposite
the
sentry
,
and
contemplate
them
at
leisure
,
in
period
vary
from
fifteen
minute
to
fifty
,
and
average
twenty
-
five
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
much
strike
a
day
or
two
since
,
by
the
behaviour
of
a
very
promising
young
butcher
who
(
evince
an
interest
in
the
service
,
which
can
not
be
too
strongly
command
or
encourage
)
,
after
a
prolonged
inspection
of
the
sentry
,
proceed
to
handle
his
boot
with
great
curiosity
,
and
as
much
composure
and
indifference
as
if
the
man
be
wax
-
work
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
really
military
young
gentleman
be
wait
all
this
time
,
and
at
the
very
moment
that
an
apology
rise
to
our
lip
,
he
emerge
from
the
barrack
gate
(
he
be
quarter
in
a
garrison
town
)
,
and
take
the
way
towards
the
high
street
.
 
<EOS>
He
wear
his
undress
uniform
,
which
somewhat
mar
the
glory
of
his
outward
man
;
but
still
how
great
,
how
grand
,
he
be
!
 
<EOS>
what
a
happy
mixture
of
ease
and
ferocity
in
his
gait
and
carriage
,
and
how
lightly
he
carry
that
dreadful
sword
under
his
arm
,
make
no
more
ado
about
it
than
if
it
be
a
silk
umbrella
!
 
<EOS>
the
lion
be
sleep
:
 
<EOS>
only
think
if
an
enemy
be
in
sight
,
how
soon
he
would
whip
it
out
of
the
scabbard
,
and
what
a
terrible
fellow
he
would
be
!
  
<EOS>
but
he
walk
on
,
think
of
nothing
less
than
blood
and
slaughter
;
and
now
he
come
in
sight
of
three
other
military
young
gentleman
,
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
who
be
bear
down
towards
him
,
clank
their
iron
heel
on
the
pavement
,
and
clash
their
sword
with
a
noise
,
which
should
cause
all
peaceful
man
to
quail
at
heart
.
 
<EOS>
They
stop
to
talk
.
 
<EOS>
see
how
the
flaxen
-
haired
young
gentleman
with
the
weak
leg
---
he
who
have
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
thrust
into
the
breast
of
his
coat
-
glare
upon
the
fainthearte
civilian
who
linger
to
look
upon
his
glory
;
how
the
next
young
gentleman
elevate
his
head
in
the
air
,
and
majestically
place
his
arm
a
-
kimbo
,
while
the
third
stand
with
his
leg
very
wide
apart
,
and
clasp
his
hand
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
well
may
we
inquire
---
not
in
familiar
jest
,
but
in
respectful
earnest
---
if
you
call
that
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
if
some
encroach
foreign
power
---
the
Emperor
of
Russia
,
for
instance
,
or
any
of
those
deep
fellow
,
could
only
see
those
military
young
gentleman
as
they
move
on
together
towards
the
billiard
-
room
over
the
way
,
would
not
he
tremble
a
little
!
  
<EOS>
and
then
,
at
the
Theatre
at
night
,
when
the
performance
be
by
command
of
Colonel
Fitz
-
Sordust
and
the
officer
of
the
garrison
---
what
a
splendid
sight
it
be
!
 
<EOS>
how
sternly
the
defender
of
their
country
look
round
the
house
as
if
in
mute
assurance
to
the
audience
,
that
they
may
make
themselves
comfortable
regard
any
foreign
invasion
,
for
they
(
the
military
young
gentleman
)
be
keep
a
sharp
look
-
out
,
and
be
ready
for
anything
.
 
<EOS>
and
what
a
contrast
between
them
,
and
that
stage
-
box
full
of
grey
-
head
officer
with
token
of
many
battle
about
them
,
who
have
nothing
at
all
in
common
with
the
military
young
gentleman
,
and
who
---
but
for
an
old
-
fashioned
kind
of
manly
dignity
in
their
look
and
bearing
---
may
be
common
hard
-
work
soldier
for
anything
they
take
the
pain
to
announce
to
the
contrary
!
  
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
here
be
a
family
just
come
in
who
recognise
the
flaxen
-
head
young
gentleman
;
and
the
flaxen
-
head
young
gentleman
recognise
them
too
,
only
he
do
not
care
to
show
it
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
very
well
do
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
He
talk
louder
to
the
little
group
of
military
young
gentleman
who
be
stand
by
him
,
and
cough
to
induce
some
lady
in
the
next
box
but
one
to
look
round
,
in
order
that
their
face
may
undergo
the
same
ordeal
of
criticism
to
which
they
have
subject
,
in
not
a
wholly
inaudible
tone
,
the
majority
of
the
female
portion
of
the
audience
.
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
a
gentleman
in
the
same
box
look
round
as
if
he
be
dispose
to
resent
this
as
an
impertinence
;
and
the
flaxen
-
head
young
gentleman
see
his
friend
at
once
,
and
hurry
away
to
them
with
the
most
charming
cordiality
.
  
<EOS>
three
young
lady
,
one
young
man
,
and
the
mamma
of
the
party
,
receive
the
military
young
gentleman
with
great
warmth
and
politeness
,
and
in
five
minute
afterwards
the
military
young
gentleman
,
stimulate
by
the
mamma
,
introduce
the
two
other
military
young
gentleman
with
whom
he
be
walk
in
the
morning
,
who
take
their
seat
behind
the
young
lady
and
commence
conversation
;
whereat
the
mamma
bestow
a
triumphant
bow
upon
a
rival
mamma
,
who
have
not
succeed
in
decoy
any
military
young
gentleman
,
and
prepare
to
consider
her
visitor
from
that
moment
three
of
the
most
elegant
and
superior
young
gentleman
in
the
whole
world
.
    
<EOS>
the
Political
Young
Gentleman
    
once
upon
a
time
---
not
in
the
day
when
pig
drink
wine
,
but
in
a
more
recent
period
of
our
history
---
it
be
customary
to
banish
politic
when
lady
be
present
.
 
<EOS>
if
this
usage
still
prevail
,
we
should
have
have
no
chapter
for
political
young
gentleman
,
for
lady
would
have
neither
know
nor
care
what
kind
of
monster
<EOS>
a
political
young
gentleman
be
.
 
<EOS>
but
as
this
good
custom
in
common
with
many
other
have
"
go
out
,
"
and
leave
no
word
when
it
be
likely
to
be
home
again
;
as
political
young
lady
be
by
no
means
rare
,
and
political
young
gentleman
the
very
reverse
of
scarce
,
we
be
bind
in
the
strict
discharge
of
our
most
responsible
duty
not
to
neglect
this
natural
division
of
our
subject
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
political
young
gentleman
be
resident
in
a
country
town
(
and
there
are
political
young
gentleman
in
country
town
sometimes
)
,
he
be
wholly
absorb
in
his
politic
;
as
a
pair
of
purple
spectacle
communicate
the
same
uniform
tint
to
all
object
near
and
remote
,
so
the
political
glass
,
with
which
the
young
gentleman
assist
his
mental
vision
,
give
to
everything
the
hue
and
tinge
of
party
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
the
political
young
gentleman
would
as
soon
think
of
be
strike
with
the
beauty
of
a
young
lady
in
the
opposite
interest
,
as
he
would
dream
of
marry
his
sister
to
the
opposite
member
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
political
young
gentleman
be
a
Conservative
,
he
have
usually
some
vague
idea
about
Ireland
and
the
Pope
which
he
can
not
very
clearly
explain
,
but
which
he
know
be
the
right
sort
of
thing
,
and
not
to
be
very
easily
get
over
by
the
other
side
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
also
some
choice
sentence
regard
church
and
state
,
cull
from
the
banner
in
use
at
the
last
election
,
with
which
he
intersperse
his
conversation
at
interval
with
surprising
effect
.
 
<EOS>
but
his
great
topic
be
the
constitution
,
upon
which
he
will
declaim
,
by
the
hour
together
,
with
much
heat
and
fury
;
<EOS>
not
that
he
have
any
particular
information
on
the
subject
,
but
because
he
know
that
the
constitution
be
somehow
church
and
state
,
and
church
and
state
somehow
the
constitution
,
and
that
the
fellow
on
the
other
side
say
it
be
not
,
which
be
quite
a
sufficient
reason
for
him
to
say
it
be
,
and
to
stick
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
his
great
topic
of
all
,
though
,
be
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
if
a
fight
take
place
in
a
populous
town
,
in
which
many
nose
be
break
,
and
a
few
window
,
the
young
gentleman
throw
down
the
newspaper
with
a
triumphant
air
,
and
exclaim
,
"
<EOS>
here
be
your
precious
people
!
"
 
<EOS>
if
half
-
a
-
dozen
boy
run
across
the
course
at
race
time
,
when
it
ought
to
be
keep
clear
,
the
young
gentleman
look
indignantly
round
,
and
beg
you
to
observe
the
conduct
of
the
people
;
if
the
gallery
demand
a
hornpipe
between
the
play
and
the
afterpiece
,
the
same
young
gentleman
cry
"
<EOS>
no
"
and
"
Shame
"
till
he
be
hoarse
,
and
then
inquire
with
a
sneer
what
you
think
of
popular
moderation
now
<EOS>
;
in
short
,
the
people
form
a
never
-
fail
theme
for
him
;
and
when
the
attorney
,
on
the
side
of
his
candidate
,
dwell
upon
it
with
great
power
of
eloquence
at
election
time
,
as
he
never
fail
to
do
,
the
young
gentleman
and
his
friend
,
and
the
body
they
head
,
cheer
with
great
violence
against
the
other
PEOPLE
,
with
whom
,
of
course
,
they
have
no
possible
connexion
.
 
<EOS>
in
much
the
same
manner
the
audience
at
a
theatre
never
fail
to
be
highly
amuse
with
any
joke
at
the
expense
of
the
public
---
always
laugh
heartily
at
some
other
public
,
and
never
at
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
political
young
gentleman
be
a
Radical
,
he
be
usually
a
very
profound
person
indeed
,
have
great
store
of
theoretical
question
to
put
to
you
,
with
an
infinite
variety
of
possible
case
and
logical
deduction
therefrom
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
be
of
the
utilitarian
school
,
too
,
which
be
more
than
probable
,
he
be
particularly
pleasant
company
,
have
many
ingenious
remark
to
offer
upon
the
voluntary
principle
and
various
cheerful
disquisition
connect
with
the
population
of
the
country
,
the
position
of
Great
Britain
in
the
scale
of
nation
,
and
the
balance
of
power
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
be
exceedingly
well
verse
in
all
doctrine
of
political
economy
as
lay
down
in
the
newspaper
,
and
know
a
great
many
parliamentary
speech
by
heart
;
nay
,
he
have
a
small
stock
of
aphorism
,
none
of
them
exceed
a
couple
of
line
in
length
,
which
will
settle
the
tough
question
and
leave
you
nothing
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
all
the
young
lady
to
understand
,
that
Miss
Martineau
be
the
great
woman
that
ever
live
;
and
when
they
praise
the
good
look
of
Mr
Hawkins
the
new
member
,
say
he
be
very
well
for
a
representative
,
all
thing
consider
,
but
he
want
a
little
call
to
account
,
and
he
be
more
than
half
afraid
it
will
be
necessary
to
bring
him
down
on
his
knee
for
that
vote
on
the
miscellaneous
estimate
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
,
the
young
lady
express
much
wonderment
,
and
say
surely
a
Member
of
Parliament
be
not
to
be
bring
upon
his
knee
so
easily
;
in
reply
to
which
the
political
young
gentleman
smile
sternly
,
and
throw
out
dark
hint
regard
the
speedy
arrival
of
that
day
,
when
Members
of
Parliament
will
be
pay
salary
,
and
require
to
render
weekly
account
of
their
proceeding
,
at
which
the
young
lady
utter
many
expression
of
astonishment
and
incredulity
,
while
their
lady
-
mother
regard
the
prophecy
as
little
else
than
blasphemous
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
extremely
improve
and
interesting
to
hear
two
political
young
gentleman
,
of
diverse
opinion
,
discuss
some
great
question
across
a
dinner
-
table
;
such
as
,
whether
,
if
the
public
be
admit
to
Westminster
Abbey
for
nothing
,
they
would
or
would
not
convey
small
chisel
and
hammer
in
their
pocket
,
and
immediately
set
about
chip
all
the
nose
off
the
statue
;
or
whether
,
if
they
once
get
into
the
Tower
for
a
shilling
,
they
would
not
insist
upon
try
the
crown
on
their
own
head
,
and
loading
and
fire
off
all
the
small
arm
in
the
armoury
,
to
the
great
discomposure
of
Whitechapel
and
the
Minories
.
 
<EOS>
upon
these
,
and
many
other
momentous
question
which
agitate
the
public
mind
in
these
desperate
day
,
they
will
discourse
with
great
vehemence
and
irritation
for
a
considerable
time
together
,
both
leave
off
precisely
where
they
begin
,
and
each
thoroughly
persuade
that
he
have
get
the
well
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
in
society
,
at
assembly
,
ball
,
and
playhouse
,
these
political
young
gentleman
be
perpetually
on
the
watch
for
a
political
allusion
,
or
anything
which
can
be
torture
or
construe
into
be
one
;
when
,
thrust
themselves
into
the
very
small
opening
for
their
favourite
discourse
,
they
fall
upon
the
unhappy
company
tooth
and
nail
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
recently
have
many
favourable
opportunity
of
open
in
church
,
but
as
there
the
clergyman
have
it
all
his
own
way
,
and
must
not
be
contradict
,
whatever
politic
he
preach
,
they
be
fain
to
hold
their
tongue
until
they
reach
the
outer
door
,
though
at
the
imminent
risk
of
burst
in
the
effort
.
  
<EOS>
as
such
discussion
can
please
nobody
but
the
talkative
party
concern
,
we
hope
they
will
henceforth
take
the
hint
and
discontinue
them
,
otherwise
we
now
give
them
warn
,
that
the
lady
have
our
advice
to
discountenance
such
talker
altogether
.
    
<EOS>
the
Domestic
Young
Gentleman
    
let
us
make
a
slight
sketch
of
our
amiable
friend
,
Mr
Felix
Nixon
.
<EOS>
We
be
strongly
disposed
to
think
,
that
if
we
put
him
in
this
place
,
he
will
answer
our
purpose
without
another
word
of
comment
.
  
<EOS>
Felix
,
then
,
be
a
young
gentleman
who
live
at
home
with
his
mother
,
just
within
the
twopenny
-
post
office
circle
of
three
mile
from
St.
Martin
-
le
-
Grand
.
 
<EOS>
He
wear
Indiarubber
golosh
when
the
weather
be
at
all
damp
,
and
always
have
a
silk
handkerchief
neatly
fold
up
in
the
right
-
hand
pocket
of
his
great
-
coat
,
to
tie
over
his
mouth
when
he
go
home
at
night
;
moreover
,
be
rather
near
-
sight
,
he
carry
spectacle
for
particular
occasion
,
and
have
a
weakish
tremulous
voice
,
of
which
he
make
great
use
,
for
he
talk
as
much
as
any
old
lady
breathing
.
  
<EOS>
the
two
chief
subject
of
Felix
's
discourse
,
be
himself
and
his
mother
,
both
of
whom
would
appear
to
be
very
wonderful
and
interesting
person
.
 
<EOS>
as
Felix
and
his
mother
be
seldom
apart
in
body
,
so
Felix
and
his
mother
be
scarcely
ever
separate
in
spirit
.
<EOS>
if
you
ask
Felix
how
he
find
himself
to
-
day
,
he
preface
his
reply
with
a
long
and
minute
bulletin
of
his
mother
's
state
of
health
;
and
the
good
lady
in
her
turn
,
edify
her
acquaintance
with
a
circumstantial
and
alarming
account
,
how
he
sneeze
four
time
and
cough
once
after
be
out
in
the
rain
the
other
night
,
but
have
his
foot
promptly
put
into
hot
water
,
and
his
head
into
a
flannel
-
something
,
which
we
will
not
describe
more
particularly
than
by
this
delicate
allusion
,
be
happily
bring
round
by
the
next
morning
,
and
enable
to
go
to
business
as
usual
.
  
<EOS>
Our
friend
be
not
a
very
adventurous
or
hot
-
headed
person
,
but
he
have
pass
through
many
danger
,
as
his
mother
can
testify
:
 
there
be
one
great
story
in
particular
,
concern
a
hackney
coachman
who
want
to
overcharge
him
one
night
for
bring
them
home
from
the
play
,
upon
which
Felix
give
the
aforesaid
coachman
a
look
which
his
mother
think
would
have
crush
him
to
the
earth
,
but
which
do
not
crush
him
quite
,
for
he
continue
to
demand
another
sixpence
,
notwithstanding
that
Felix
take
out
his
pocket
-
book
,
and
,
with
the
aid
of
a
flat
candle
,
point
out
the
fare
in
print
,
which
the
coachman
obstinately
disregard
,
he
shut
the
street
-
door
with
a
slam
which
his
mother
shudder
to
think
of
;
and
then
,
rouse
to
the
most
appalling
pitch
of
passion
by
the
coachman
knock
a
double
knock
to
show
that
he
be
by
no
mean
convinced
,
he
break
with
uncontrollable
force
from
his
parent
and
the
servant
girl
,
and
run
into
the
street
without
his
hat
,
actually
shake
his
fist
at
the
coachman
,
and
come
back
again
with
a
face
as
white
,
Mrs
Nixon
say
,
look
about
her
for
a
simile
,
as
white
as
that
ceiling
.
<EOS>
She
never
will
forget
his
fury
that
night
,
never
!
  
<EOS>
to
this
account
Felix
listen
with
a
solemn
face
,
occasionally
look
at
you
to
see
how
it
affect
you
,
and
when
his
mother
have
make
an
end
of
it
,
add
that
he
look
at
every
coachman
he
meet
for
three
week
afterwards
,
in
hope
that
he
may
see
the
scoundrel
;
whereupon
Mrs
Nixon
,
with
an
exclamation
of
terror
,
request
to
know
what
he
would
have
do
to
him
if
he
have
see
him
,
at
which
Felix
smile
darkly
and
clench
his
right
fist
,
she
exclaim
,
"
goodness
gracious
!
"
<EOS>
with
a
distracted
air
,
and
insist
upon
extort
a
promise
that
he
never
will
on
any
account
do
anything
so
rash
,
which
her
dutiful
son
---
it
be
something
more
than
three
year
since
the
offence
be
commit
---
reluctantly
concede
,
and
his
mother
,
shake
her
head
prophetically
,
fear
with
a
sigh
that
his
spirit
will
lead
him
into
something
violent
yet
.
 
<EOS>
the
discourse
then
,
by
an
easy
transition
,
turn
upon
the
spirit
which
glow
within
the
bosom
of
Felix
,
upon
which
point
Felix
himself
become
eloquent
,
and
relate
a
thrilling
anecdote
of
the
time
when
he
use
to
sit
up
till
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
read
French
,
and
how
his
mother
use
to
say
,
"
Felix
,
you
will
make
yourself
ill
<EOS>
,
I
know
you
will
;
"
and
how
he
use
to
say
,
"
mother
,
I
do
not
care
---
I
will
do
it
;
"
and
how
at
last
his
mother
privately
procure
a
doctor
to
come
and
see
him
,
who
declare
,
<EOS>
the
moment
he
feel
his
pulse
,
that
if
he
have
go
on
read
one
night
more
---
only
one
night
more
---
he
must
have
put
a
blister
on
each
temple
,
and
another
between
his
shoulder
;
and
who
,
as
it
be
,
sit
down
upon
the
instant
,
and
write
a
prescription
for
a
blue
pill
,
say
it
must
be
take
immediately
,
or
he
would
not
answer
for
the
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
the
recital
of
these
and
many
other
move
peril
of
the
like
nature
,
constantly
harrow
up
the
feeling
of
Mr
Nixon
's
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Nixon
have
a
tolerably
extensive
circle
of
female
acquaintance
,
be
a
good
-
humoured
,
talkative
,
bustle
little
body
,
and
to
the
unmarried
girl
among
them
<EOS>
she
be
constantly
vaunt
the
virtue
of
her
son
,
hint
that
she
will
be
a
very
happy
person
who
win
him
,
but
that
they
must
mind
their
p
's
and
Q
's
,
for
he
be
very
particular
,
and
terribly
severe
upon
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
last
caution
the
young
lady
resident
in
the
same
row
,
who
happen
to
be
spend
the
evening
there
,
put
their
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
before
their
mouth
,
and
be
trouble
with
a
short
cough
;
just
then
Felix
knock
at
the
door
,
and
his
mother
draw
the
tea
-
table
near
the
fire
,
call
out
to
him
as
he
take
off
his
boot
in
the
back
parlour
that
he
nee
not
mind
come
in
in
his
slipper
,
for
there
be
only
the

in

very
faint
for

change
the
subject
of
discourse
,
and
enable
her
to
laugh
out
boldly
and
tell
Amelia
Grey
not
to
be
so
foolish
.
 
<EOS>
here
they
all
three
laugh
,
and
Mrs
Nixon
say
they
be
giddy
girl
;
in
which
stage
of
the
proceeding
,
Felix
,
who
have
by
this

refreshen
himself
with
the
grateful
herb
that
"
cheer

whereat

and
tell

not
to

sly
,
which
call
forth
a
general
laugh
from
the
young

,
and
another
smile
from
Felix
,
who
,
think
he
look
very
sly
indeed
,
be
perfectly
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
tea
be
over
,
the
young

resume
their
work
,
and
Felix
insist
upon
hold
a
skein
of

while
Miss

wind
it
on
a
card

<EOS>
this
process
have
be
perform
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
party
,
he
bring
down
his
flute
in
compliance
with
a
request
from
the
young
Miss
Grey
,
and
play
diver
tune
out
of
a
very
small
music
-
book
till
supper
-
time
,
when
he
be
very
facetious
and
talkative
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
finally
,
after
half
a
tumblerful
of
warm
sherry
and
water
,
he
gallantly
put
on
his
golosh
over
his
slipper
,
and
tell
Miss
Thompson
's
servant
to
run
on
first
and
get
the
door
open
,
escort
that
young
lady
to
her
house

five
door
off
:
 
the
Miss

who
live
in

but
one
stop
to
peep
with
merry
face
from
their

door
till
he
come
back
again
,
when
they
call
out
"
very
well
,
Mr
Felix
,
"
and
trip
into
the
passage
with
a
laugh
more
musical
than
any
flute
that
be
ever
play
.
  
<EOS>
Felix
be
rather
prim
in
his
appearance
,
and
perhaps
a
little
priggish
about
his
book
and
flute
,
and
so
forth
,
which
have
all
their
peculiar
corner
of
peculiar
shelf
in
his
bedroom
;
indeed
all
his
female
acquaintance
(
and
they
be
good
judge
)
have
long
ago
set
him
down
as
a
thorough
old
bachelor
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
favourite
with
them
however
,
in
a
certain
way
,
as
an
honest
,
inoffensive
,
kind
-
hearted
creature
;
and
as
his
peculiarity
harm
nobody
,
not
even
himself
,
we
be
induce
to
hope
that
many
who
be
not
personally
acquaint
with
him
will
take
our
good
word
in
his

,
and
be
content
to

after
much
experience
of

,
and
considerable
turning
over
of
the
subject
in
our
mind
,
we
feel
it
our
duty
to
affix
the
above
appellation
.
 
<EOS>
young

mildly
call
him
a
"
sarcastic
"
young

or
a

severe
"
young

<EOS>
We
,
who
know
better
,
beg
to
acquaint
them
with
the
fact

that
he
be
merely
a

young

sneer

accompany

expressive

the
conclusion
that

something
very
deep

for
they
reason
in
this
way
---
"
this
young

look
so
very

It
be
extraordinary
how
soon
a
censorious
young

may
make

must
have
be
a
runaway
knock
,
when
our

sink
into
a

.
 
<EOS>
He
make
one
most
excellent
joke
in
snuff
a
candle
,
which
be
neither
more
nor
less
than
set
fire
to
the
hair
of
a
pale
young
gentleman
who
sit
next
him
,
and
afterwards
beg
his
pardon
with
considerable
humour
.
 
<EOS>
as
the
young
gentleman
could
not
see
the
joke
however
,
possibly
in
consequence
of
its
being
on
the
top
of
his
own
head
,
it
do
not
go
off
quite
as
well
as
it
may
have
do
;
indeed
,
the
young
gentleman
be
hear
to
murmur
some
general
reference
to
"
impertinence
,
"
and
a
"
rascal
,
"
and
to
state
the
number
of
his
lodging
in
an
angry
tone
---
a
turn
of
the
conversation
which
may
have
be
productive
of
slaughterous
consequence
,
if
a
young
lady
,
betroth
to
the
young
gentleman
,
have
not
use
her
immediate
influence
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
:
 
emphatically
declare
in
an
agitated
whisper
,
intend
for
his
peculiar
edification
but
audible
to
the
whole
table
,
that
if
he
go
on
in
that
way
,
she
never
would
think
of
him
otherwise
than
as
a
friend
,
though
as
that
she
must
always
regard
him
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
terrible
threat
the
young
gentleman
become
calm
,
and
the
young
lady
,
overcome
by
the
revulsion
of
feeling
,
instantaneously
faint
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Griggins
's
spirit
be
slightly
depressed
for
a
short
period
by
this
unlooke
-
for
result
of
such
a
harmless
pleasantry
,
but
be
promptly
elevate
by
the
attention
of
the
host
and
several
glass
of
wine
,
he
soon
recover
,
and
become
even
more
vivacious
than
before
,
insomuch
that
the
stout
gentleman
previously
refer
to
,
assure
us
that
although
he
have
know
him
since
he
be
that
high
<EOS>
(
something
small
than
a
nutmeg
-
grater
)
,
he
have
never
beheld
him
in
such
excellent
cue
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
round
game
and
several
game
at
blind
man
's
buff
which
follow
it
be
all
over
,
and
we
be
go
down
to
supper
,
the
inexhaustible
Mr
Griggins
produce
a
small
sprig
of
mistletoe
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
and
commence
a
general
kissing
of
the
assemble
female
,
which
occasion
great
commotion
and
much
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
We
observe
that
several
young
gentleman
---
include
the
young
gentleman
with
the
pale
countenance
---
be
greatly
scandalise
at
this
indecorous
proceeding
,
and
talk
very
big
among
themselves
in
corner
;
and
we
observe
too
,
that
several
young
lady
when
remonstrate
with
by
the
aforesaid
young
gentleman
,
call
each
other
to
witness
how
they
have
struggle
,
and
protest
vehemently
that
it
be
very
rude
,
and
that
they
be
surprised
at
Mrs
Brown
's
allow
it
,
and
that
they
could
not
bear
it
,
and
have
no
patience
with
such
impertinence
.
 
<EOS>
but
such
be
the
gentle
and
forgiving
nature
of
woman
,
that
although
we
look
very
narrowly
for
it
,
we
could
not
detect
the
slight
harshness
in
the
subsequent
treatment
of
Mr
Griggins
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
upon
the
whole
,
it
strike
us
that
among
the
lady
he
seem
rather
more
popular
than
before
!
  
<EOS>
to
recount
all
the
drollery
of
Mr
Griggins
at
supper
,
would
fill
such
a
tiny
volume
as
this
,
to
the
very
bottom
of
the
outside
cover
.
 
<EOS>
how
he
drink
out
of
other
people
's
glass
,
and
eat
of
other
people
's
bread
,
how
he
frighten
into
scream
convulsion
a
little
boy
who
be
sit
up
to
supper
in
a
high
chair
,
by
sink
below
the
table
and
suddenly
reappear
with
a
mask
on
;
how
the
hostess
be
really
surprised
that
anybody
could
find
a
pleasure
in
torment
child
,
and
how
the
host
frown
at
the
hostess
,
and
feel
convinced
that
Mr
Griggins
have
do
it
with
the
very
good
intention
;
how
Mr
Griggins
explain
,
and
how
everybody
's
good
-
humour
be
restore
but
the
child
's
;
---
to
tell
these
and
a
hundred
other
thing
ever
so
briefly
,
would
occupy
more
of
our
room
and
our
reader
'
patience
,
than
either
they
or
we
can
conveniently
spare
.
 
<EOS>
therefore
we
change
the
subject
,
merely
observe
that
we
have
offer
no
description
of
the
funny
young
gentleman
's
personal
appearance

believe
that
almost
every

<EOS>
from

I

that

say
no

<EOS>
It

He

when

and
then

<EOS>
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
have
a
great
reverence
for
all
that
be
connect
with
the
stage
department
of
the
different
theatre
.
<EOS>
He
would
,
at
any
time
,
prefer
go
a
street
or
two
out
of
his
way
,
to
omit
to
pass
a
stage
-
entrance
,
into
which
he
always
look
with
a
curious
and
searching
eye
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
can
only
identify
a
popular
actor
in
the
street
,
he
be
in
a
perfect
transport
of
delight
;
and
no
sooner
meet
him
,
than
he
hurry
back
,
and
walk
a
few
pace
in
front
of
him
,
so
that
he
can
turn
round
from
time
to
time
,
and
have
a
good
stare
at
his
feature
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
upon
a
theatrical
-
fund
dinner
as
one
of
the
most
enchanting
festivity
ever
know
;
and
think
that
to
be
a
member
of
the
Garrick
Club
,
and
see
so
many
actor
in
their
plain
clothe
,
must
be
one
of
the
high
gratification
the
world
can
bestow
.
  
<EOS>
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
be
a
constant
half
-
price
visitor
at

other
of
the
theatre
,
and
have
an
infinite
relish
for
all
piece
which
display
the
full
resource
of
the
establishment
.
<EOS>
He
like
to
place
implicit
reliance
upon
the
play
-
bill
when
he
go
to
see
a
show
-
piece
,
and
work
himself
up
to
such
a
pitch
of
enthusiasm
,
as
not
only
to
believe
(
if
the
bill
say
so
)
that
there
be
three
hundred
and
seventy
-
five
people
on
the
stage
at
one
time
in
the
last
scene
,
but
be
highly
indignant
with
you
,
unless
you
believe
it
also
.
 
<EOS>
He
consider
that
if
the
stage
be
open
from
the
foot
-
light
to
the
back
wall
,
in
any
new
play
,
the
piece
be
a
triumph
of
dramatic
writing
,
and
applaud
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
a
great
notion
of
trap
-
door
too
;
and
think
any
character
go
down
or
come
up
a
trap
(
no
matter
whether
he
be
an
angel
or
a
demon
---
they
both
do
it
occasionally
)
<EOS>
one
of
the
most
interesting
feat
in
the
whole
range
of
scenic
illusion
.
  
<EOS>
besides
these
acquirement
,
he
have
several
veracious
account
to
communicate
of
the
private
manner
and
custom
of
different
actor
,
which
,
during
the
pause
of
a
quadrille
,
he
usually
communicate
to
his
partner
,
or
impart
to
his
neighbour
at
a
supper
table
.
 
<EOS>
thus
he
be
advise
,
that
Mr
Liston
always
have
a
footman
in
gorgeous
livery
wait
at
the
side
-
scene
with
a
brandy
bottle
and
tumbler
,
to
administer
half
a
pint
or
so
of
spirit
to
him
every
time
he
come
off
,
without
which
assistance
he
must
infallibly
have
faint
.
 
<EOS>
He
know
for
a
fact
,
that
,
after
an
arduous
part
,
Mr
George
Bennett
be
put
between
two
feather
bed
,
to
absorb
the
perspiration
;
and
be
credibly
inform
,
that
Mr
Baker
have
,
for
many
year
,
submit
to
a
course
of
lukewarm
toast
-
and
-
water
,
to
qualify
him
to
sustain
his
favourite
character
.
 
<EOS>
He
look
upon
Mr
Fitz
Ball
as
the
principal
dramatic
genius
and
poet
of
the
day
;
but
hold
that
there
be
great
writer
extant
besides
him
,
---
<EOS>
in
proof
whereof
he
refer
you
to
various
drama
and
melodramas
recently
produce
,
of
which
he
take
in
all
the
sixpenny
and
three
-
penny
edition
as
fast
as
they
appear
.
  
<EOS>
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
be
a
great
advocate
for
violence
of
emotion
and
redundancy
of
action
.
 
<EOS>
if
a
father
have
to
curse
a
child
upon
the
stage
,
he
like
to
see
it
do
in
the
thorough
-
go
style
,
with
no
mistake
about
it
:
 
to
which
end
it
be
essential
that
the
child
should
follow
the
father
on
her
knee
,
and
be
knock
violently
over
on
her
face
by
the
old
gentleman
as
he
go
into
a
small
cottage
,
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
like
to
see
a
blessing
invoke
upon
the
young
lady
,
when
the
old
gentleman
repent
,
with
equal
earnestness
,
and
accompany
by
the
usual
conventional
form
,
which
consist
of
the
old
gentleman
look
anxiously
up
into
the
cloud
,
as
if
to
see
whether
it
rain
,
and
then
spread
an
imaginary
tablecloth
in
the
air
over
the
young
lady
's
head
---
soft
music
play
all
the
while
.
 
<EOS>
upon
these
,
and
other
point
of
a
similar
kind
,
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
be
a
great
critic
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
likewise
very
acute
in
judging
of
natural
expression
of
the
passion
,
and
know
precisely
the
frown
,
wink
,
nod
,
or
leer
,
which
stand
for
any
one
of
them
,
or
the
mean
by
which
it
may
be
convert
into
any
other
:
 
as
jealousy
,
with
a
good
stamp
of
the
right
foot
,
become
anger
;
or
wildness
,
with
the
hand
clasp
before
the
throat
,
instead
of
tear
the
wig
,
be
passionate
love
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
venture
to
express
a
doubt
of
the
accuracy
of
any
of
these
portraiture
,
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
assure
you
,
with
a
haughty
smile
,
that
it
always
have
be
do
in
that
way
,
and
he
suppose
they
be
not
go
to
change
it
at
this
time
of
day
to
please
you
;
to
which
,
of
course
,
you
meekly
reply
that
you
suppose
not
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
innumerable
disquisition
of
this
nature
,
in
which
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
be
very
profound
,
especially
to
lady
whom
he
be
most
in
the
habit
of
entertain
with
them
;
but
as
we
have
no
space
to
recapitulate
them
at
great
length
,
we
must
rest
content
with
call
the
attention
of
the
young
lady
in
general
to
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
of
their
own
acquaintance
.
    
<EOS>
the
Poetical
Young
Gentleman
    
Time
be

and
not
very
long
ago
either
,
when
a
singular
epidemic

vast
number
of
whom
,
under
the
influence
of
the
malady
,
tear
off
their
neckerchief
,
turn
down
their
shirt
collar
,
and
exhibit
themselves
in
the
open
street
with
bare
throat
and
dejected
countenance
,
before
the
eye
of
an
astonished
public
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
poetical
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
the
custom
be
gradually
find
to
be
inconvenient
,
as
involve
the
necessity
of
too
much
clean
linen
and
too
large
washing
bill
,
and
these
outward
symptom
have
consequently
pass
away

but
we
be
dispose
to
think
,
notwithstanding

that
the
number
of
poetical
young

be
considerably
on
the
increase

<EOS>
We
know
a
poetical
young

a
very
poetical
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
not
mean
to
say
that
he
be
troubled
with
the
gift
of
poesy
in
any
remarkable
degree
,
but
his
countenance
be
of
a
plaintive
and
melancholy
cast
,
his
manner
be
abstract
and
bespeak
affliction
of
soul
:
 
<EOS>
he
seldom
have
his
hair
cut
,
and
often
talk
about
be
an
outcast

from
which
,
as
well
as
from
many
general
observation
in
which
he
be

not
to
indulge
,
concern
mysterious
impulse
,
and
yearning
of
the
heart
,
and
the
supremacy
of
intellect
gild
all
earthly
thing
with
the
glow
magic
of
immortal
verse
,
it
be
clear
to
all
his
friend
that
he
have
be
stricken
poetical
.
  
<EOS>
the
favourite
attitude
of
the
poetical
young
gentleman
be
lounge
on
a
sofa
with
his
eye
fix
upon
the
ceiling
,
or
sit
bolt
upright
in
a
high
-
back
chair
,
stare
with
very
round
eye
at
the
opposite
wall
.
 
<EOS>
when
he
be
in
one
of
these
position
,
his
mother
,
who
be
a
worthy
,
affectionate
old
soul
,
will
give
you
a
nudge
to
bespeak
your
attention
without
disturb
the
abstract
one
,
and
whisper
with
a
shake
of
the
head
,
that
John
's
imagination
be
at
some
extraordinary
work
or
other
,
you
may
take
her
word
for
it
.
<EOS>
Hereupon
John
look
more
fiercely
intent
upon
vacancy
than
before
,
and
suddenly
snatch
a
pencil
from
his
pocket
,
put
down
three
word
,
and
a
cross
on
the
back
of
a
card
,
sigh
deeply
,
pace
once
or
twice
across
the
room
,
inflict
a
most
unmerciful
slap
upon
his
head
,
and
walk
moodily
up
to
his
dormitory
.
  
<EOS>
the
poetical
young
gentleman
be
apt
to
acquire
peculiar
notion
of
thing
too
,
<EOS>
which
plain
ordinary
people
,
unblessed
with
a
poetical
obliquity
of
vision
,
would
suppose
to
be
rather
distorted
.
 
<EOS>
for
instance
,
when
the
sickening
murder
and
mangling
of
a
wretched
woman
be
afford
delicious
food
wherewithal
to
gorge
the
insatiable
curiosity
of
the
public
,
our
friend
the
poetical
young
gentleman
be
in
ecstasy
---
not
of
disgust
,
but
admiration
.
<EOS>
"
Heavens
!
"
cry
the
poetical
young
gentleman
,
"
<EOS>
how
grand
;
how
great
!
"
 
<EOS>
We
venture
deferentially
to
inquire
upon
whom
these
epithet
be
bestow
:
 
our
humble
thought
oscillate
between
the
police
officer
who
find
the
criminal
,
and
the
lock
-
keeper
who
find
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
upon
whom
!
"
exclaim
the
poetical
young
gentleman
in
a
frenzy
of
poetry
,
"
upon
whom
should
they
be
bestow
but
upon
the
murderer
!
"
<EOS>
---
and
thereupon
it
come
out
,
in
a
fine
torrent
of
eloquence
,
that
the
murderer
be
a
great
spirit
,
a
bold
creature
full
of
daring
and
nerve
,
a
man
of
dauntless
heart
and
determined
courage
,
and
withal
a
great
casuist
and
able
reasoner
,
as
be
fully
demonstrate
in
his
philosophical
colloquy
with
the
great
and
noble
of
the
land
.
 
<EOS>
We
hold
our
peace
,
and
meekly
signify
our
indisposition
to
controvert
these
opinion
---
firstly
,
because
we
be
no
match
at
quotation
for
the
poetical
young
gentleman
;
and
secondly
,
because
we
feel
it
would
be
of
little
use
our
entering
into
any
disputation
,
if
we
be
:
 
be
perfectly
convince
that
the
respectable
and
immoral
hero
in
question
be
not
the
first
and
will
not
be
the
last
hang
gentleman
upon
whom
false
sympathy
or
disease
curiosity
will
be
plentifully
expend
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
stern
mystic
flight
of
the
poetical
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
in
his
milder
and
soft
moment
he
occasionally
lay
down
his
neckcloth
,
and
pen
stanza
,
which
sometimes
find
their
way
into
a
Lady
's
Magazine
,
or
the
"
Poets
'
corner
"
of
some
country
newspaper
;
or
which
,
in
default
of
either
vent
for
his
genius
,
adorn
the
rainbow
leave
of
a
lady
's
album
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
generally
write
upon
some
such
occasion
as
contemplate
the
Bank
of
England
by
midnight
,
or
behold
Saint
Paul
's
in
a
snow
-
storm
;
and
when
these
gloomy
object
fail
to
afford
him
inspiration
,
he
pour
forth
his
soul
in
a
touching
address
to
a
violet
,
or
a
plaintive
lament
that
he
be
no
longer
a
child
,
but
have
gradually
grow
up
.
  
<EOS>
the
poetical
young
gentleman
be
fond
of
quote
passage
from
his
favourite
author
,
who
be
all
of
the
gloomy
and
desponding
school
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
great
deal
to
say
too
about
the
world
,
and
be
much
give
to
opine
,
especially
if
he
have
take
anything
strong
to
drink
,
that
there
be
nothing
in
it
worth
live
for
.
 
<EOS>
He
give
you
to
understand
,
however
,
that
for
the
sake
of
society
,
he
mean
to
bear
his
part
in
the
tiresome
play
,
manfully
resist
the
gratification
of
his
own
strong
desire
to
make
a
premature
exit
;
and
console
himself
with
the
reflection
,
<EOS>
that
immortality
have
some
choose
nook
for
himself
and
the
other
great
spirit
whom
earth
have
chafe
and
weary

<EOS>
when
the
poetical
young

make
use
of
adjective

they
be
all
superlative

everything

Young
Gentleman
    
<EOS>
there
be
a
certain
kind
of
impostor
---
a
bragging
,
vaunt
,
puff
young
gentleman
---
against
whom
we
be
desirous
to
warn
that
fairer
part
of
the
creation
,
to
whom
we
more
peculiarly
devote
these
our
labour
.
 
<EOS>
and
we
be
particularly
induce
to
lay
especial
stress
upon
this
division
of
our
subject
,
by
a
little
dialogue
we
hold
some
short
time
ago
,
with
an
esteemed
young
lady
of
our
acquaintance
,
touch
a
most
gross
speciman
of
this
class
of
man
.
<EOS>
We
have
be
urge
all
the
absurdity
of
his
conduct
and
conversation
,
and
dwell
upon
the
impossibility
he
constantly
recount
---
to
which
indeed
we
have
not
scruple
to
prefix
a
certain
hard
little
word
of
one
syllable
and
three
letter
---
when
our
fair
friend
,
unable
to
maintain
the
contest
any
longer
,
reluctantly
cry
,
"
well
;
he
certainly
have
a
habit
of
throwing

off
,
but
<EOS>
then
---
"
 
<EOS>
what
then
?
 
<EOS>
throw
him
off
yourself
,
say
we
.
 
<EOS>
and
so
she
do
,
but
not
at
our
instance
,
for
other
reason
appear
,
and
it
may
have
be
well
if
she
have
do
so
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
the
throwing

off
young
gentleman
have
so
often
a
father
possess
of
vast
property
in
some
remote
district
of
Ireland
,
that
we
look
with
some
suspicion
upon
all
young

who
volunteer
this
description
of
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
the

grandfather
of

be
a
man
of
immense
possession
,
and
untold
wealth
;
the
throwing

off
young

remember
,
as
well
as
if
it
be
only
yesterday
,
the
deceased
baronet
's
library
,
with
its
long
row
of
scarce
and
valuable
book
in
superbly
emboss
binding

arrange
in

,
reach
from
the
lofty
ceiling
to
the
oaken
floor
;
and
the
fine
antique
chair
and
table
,
and
the
noble
old
castle
of
Ballykillbabaloo
,
with
its
splendid
prospect
of
hill
and
dale
,
and
wood
,
and
rich
wild
scenery
,
and
the
fine
hunting
stable
and
the
spacious
court

yard
,
"
and
---
and
---
everything
upon
the
same
magnificent
scale
,

say
the
throwing

off
young
gentleman
,
"
princely
;
quite
princely
.
 
<EOS>
ah
!
"
 
<EOS>
and
he
sigh
as
if
mourn
over
the
fall
fortune
of
his
noble
house
.
  
<EOS>
the
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
be
a
universal
genius
;
at
walk
,
run
,
rowing
,
swimming
,
and
skating
,
he
be
unrivalled
;
at
all
game
of
chance
or
skill
,
at
hunting
,
shooting
,
fishing
,
ride
,
driving
,
or
amateur
theatrical
,
no
one
can
touch
him
---
that
be
COULD
not
,
because
he
give
you
carefully
to
understand
,
lest
there
should
be
any
opportunity
of
test
his
skill
,
that
he
be
quite
out
of
practice
just
now
,
and
have
be
for
some
year
.
 
<EOS>
if
you
mention
any
beautiful
girl
of
your
common
acquaintance
in
his
hearing
,
the
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
start
,
smile
,
and
beg
<EOS>
you
not
to
mind
him
,
for
it
be
quite
involuntary
:
 
people
do
say
indeed
that
they
be
once
engage
,
but
no
---
although
she
be
a
very
fine
girl
,
he
be
so
situated
at
that
time
that
he
could
not
possibly
encourage
the

but
it
be
of
no

<EOS>
he
add

"
She

firmly
hope

be
happy

"
 
<EOS>
with
this
benevolent
aspiration
he
nod
his
head
in
a
mysterious
manner
,
and
whistle
the
first
part
of
some
popular
air
,
think
perhaps
it
will
be
well
to
change
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
another
great
characteristic
of
the
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
,
which
be
,
that
he
"
happen
to
be
acquaint
"
with
a
most
extraordinary
variety
of
people
in
all
part
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
thus
in
all
dispute
question
,
when
the
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
have
no
argument
to
bring
forward
,
he
invariably
happen
to
be
acquaint
with
some
distant
person
,
intimately
connect
with
the
subject
,
whose
testimony
decide
the
point
against
you
,
to
the
great
<EOS>
---
may
we
say
it
---
to
the
great
admiration
of
three
young
lady
out
of
every
four
,
who
consider
the
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
a
very
highly

connect
young
man
,
and
a
most
charming
person
.
  
<EOS>
sometimes
the
throwing

off
young
gentleman
happen
to
look
in
upon
a
little
family
circle
of
young
lady
who
be
quietly
spend
the
evening
together
,
and
then
indeed
be
he
at
the
very
height
and
summit
of
his
glory
;
for
it
be
to
be
observe
that
he
by
no
means
shine
to
equal
advantage
in
the
presence
of
man
as
in
the
society
of
over

credulous
young

which
be
his
proper
element

<EOS>
It
be
delightful
to
hear
the
number
of
pretty
thing
the

off
young

give
utterance
to
,
during
tea
,
and
still
more
so
to
observe
the
ease
with
which

from
long
practice
and
study
,
he
delicately
blend
one
compliment
to
a

with
two
for

"
do
you
ever

ask
a

rejoin
the

great
energy

"
I
fervently
hope
that
her
attachment

may
be
nothing

the
natural
result

here
the
throwing

sink
his
voice
to
a
still
low
whisper
;
and
the
young

duly
proclaim
to
all
the

when
they
go
up

to
put
their

We
have
see
a
throwing

off
young

to
our

innocent

We
have
hear
another

strike
a
note

two
upon
the

and
accompany
it
correctly

with

Epping
Forest

<EOS>
as
we
hold
that
such
wild
expedition
should
never
be
indulge
in
,
save
by
people
of
the
small
mean
,
who
have
no
dinner
at
home
,
we
should
indubitably
have
excuse
ourself
from
attend
,
if
we
have
not
recollect
that
the
projector
of
the
excursion
be
always
accompany
on
such
occasion
by
a
choice
sample
of
the
young

young

whom
we
be
very
anxious
to
have
an
opportunity
of
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
this
determine
us
,
and
we
go
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
to
make
for
Chigwell
in
four
glass

,
each
with
a
trifle
company
of
six
or
eight
inside
,
and
a
little
boy
belong
to
the
projector
on
the
box

and
to
start
from
the
residence
of
the
projector
,
Woburn
-
place
,
Russell
-
square
,
at
half
-
past
ten
precisely
.
 
<EOS>
We
arrive
at
the
place
of
rendezvous
at
the
appoint
time
,
and
find
the
glass
coach
and
the
little
boy
quite
ready
,
and
diver
young
lady
and
young
gentleman
look
anxiously
over
the
breakfast
-
parlour
blind
,
who
appear
by
no
means
so
much
gratify
by
our
approach
as
we
may
have
expect
,
but
evidently
wish
we
have
be
somebody
else
.
 
<EOS>
observe
that
our
arrival
in
lieu
of
the
unknown
occasion
some
disappointment
,
we
venture
to
inquire
who
be
yet
to
come
,
when
we
find
from
the
hasty
reply
of
a
dozen
voice
,
that
it
be
no
other
than
the
young
lady
'
young
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
imagine
,
"
say
the
mamma
,
"
what
have
become
of
Mr
Balim
---
always
so
punctual
,
always
so
pleasant
and
agreeable
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
sure
I
can
-
not
think
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
as
these
last
word
be
utter
in
that
measure
,
emphatic
manner
which
painfully
announce
that
the
speaker
have
not
quite
make
up
his
or
her
mind
what
to
say
,
but
be
determined
to
talk
on
nevertheless
,
the
eld
daughter
take
up
the
subject
,
and
hope
no
accident
have
happen
to
Mr
Balim
,
upon
which
there
be
a
general
chorus
of
"
dear
Mr
Balim
!
"
and
one
young
lady
,
more
adventurous
than
the
rest
,
propose
that
an
express
should
be
straightway
send
to
dear
Mr
Balim
's
lodging
.
 
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
the
papa
resolutely
oppose
,
observe
,
in
what
a
short
young
lady
behind
us
term
"
quite
a
bearish
way
,
"
that
if
Mr
Balim
do
not
choose
to
come
,
he
may
stop
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
all
the
daughter
raise
a
murmur
of
"
oh
pa
!
"
except
one
sprightly
little
girl
of
eight
or
ten
year
old
,
who
,
take
advantage
of
a
pause
in
the
discourse
,
remark
,
that
perhaps
Mr
Balim
may
have
be
marry
that
morning
---
for
which
impertinent
suggestion
she
be
summarily
eject
from
the
room
by
her
eld
sister
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
all
in
a
state
of
great
mortification
and
uneasiness
,
when
one
of
the
little
boy
,
run
into
the
room
as
airily
as
little
boy
usually
run
who
have
an
unlimited
allowance
of
animal
food
in
the
holiday
,
and
keep
their
hand
constantly
force
down
to
the
bottom
of
very
deep
trouser
-
pocket
when
they
take
exercise
,
<EOS>
joyfully
announce
that
Mr
Balim
be
at
that
moment
come
up
the
street
in
a
hackney
-
cab
;
and
the
intelligence
be
confirm
beyond
all
doubt
a
minute
afterwards
by
the
entry
of
Mr
Balim
himself
,
who
be
receive
with
repeat
cry
of
"
where
have
you
be
,
you
naughty
creature
?
"
<EOS>
whereunto
the
naughty
creature
reply
,
that
he
have
be
in
bed
,
in
consequence
of
a
late
party
the
night
before
,
and
have
only
just
rise
.
 
<EOS>
the
acknowledgment
awaken
a
variety
of
agonizing
fear
that
he
have
take
no
breakfast
;
which
appear
after
a
slight
cross
-
examination
to
be
the
real
state
of
the
case
,
breakfast
for
one
be
immediately
order
,
notwithstanding
Mr
Balim
's
repeat
protestation
that
he
could
not
think
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
do
think
of
it
though
,
and
think
better
of
it
too
,
for
he
make
a
remarkably
good
meal
when
it
come
,
and
be
assiduously
serve
by
a
select
knot
of
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
quite
delightful
to
see
how
he
eat
and
drank
,
while
one
pair
of
fair
hand
pour
out
his
coffee
,
and
another
put
in
the
sugar
,
and
another
the
milk
;
the
rest
of
the
company
ever
and
anon
cast
angry
glance
at
their
watch
,
and
the
glass
coach
,
---
and
the
little
boy
look
on
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
lest
it
should
begin
to
rain
before
we
set
out
;
it
may
have
rain
all
day
,
after
we
be
once
too
far
to
turn
back
again
,
and
welcome
,
for
aught
they
care
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
the
cavalcade
move
at
length
,
every
coachman
be
accommodate
with
a
hamper
between
his
leg
something
large
than
a
wheelbarrow
;
and
the
company
be
pack
as
closely
as
they
possibly
could
in
the
carriage
,
"
accord
,
"
as
one
married
lady
observe
,
"
to
the
immemorial
custom
,
which
be
half
the
diversion
of
gipsy
party
.
"
 
<EOS>
think
it
very
likely
it
may
be
<EOS>
(
we
have
never
be
able
to
discover
the
other
half
)
,
we
submit
to
be
stow
away
with
a
cheerful
aspect
,
and
be
fortunate
enough
to
occupy
one
corner
of
a
coach
in
which
be
one
old
lady
,
four
young
lady
,
and
the
renowned
Mr
Balim
the
young
lady
'
young
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
no
sooner
fairly
off
,
than
the
young
lady
'
young
gentleman
hum
a
fragment
of
an
air
,
which
induce
a
young
lady
to
inquire
whether
he
have
dance
to
that
the
night
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
by
Heaven
,
then
,
I
do
,
"
reply
the
young
gentleman
,
"
and
with
a
lovely
heiress
;
a
superb
creature
,
with
twenty
thousand
pound
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
seem
rather

"
observe
another
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Gad
she
be
a
sweet
creature
,
"
return
the
young
gentleman
,
arrange
his
hair
.
 
<EOS>
"
of
course
she
be

<EOS>
"
inquire
the
first
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
ask

love
?
"
<EOS>
interpose
the
second
;
"
could
she
fail
to
be
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
well
,
honestly
I
think
she
be
,
"
observe
the
young
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
point
of
the
dialogue
,
the
young
lady
who
have
speak
first
,
and
who
sit
on
the
young
gentleman
's
right
,
strike
him
a
severe
blow
on
the
arm
with
a
rosebud
,
and
say
he
be
a
vain
man
---
whereupon
the
young
gentleman
insist
on
have
the
rosebud
,
and
the
young
lady
appeal
for
help
to
the
other
young
lady
,
a
charming
struggle
ensue
,
terminate
in
the
victory
of
the
young
gentleman
,
and
the
capture
of
the
rosebud
.
 
<EOS>
this
little
skirmish
over
<EOS>
,
the
married
lady
,
who
be
the
mother
of
the
rosebud
,
smile
sweetly
upon
the
young
gentleman
,
and
accuse
him
of
be
a
flirt
;
the
young
gentleman
plead
not
guilty
,
a
most
interesting
discussion
take
place
upon
the
important
point
whether
the
young
gentleman
be
a
flirt
or
not
,
which
be
an
agreeable
conversation
of
a
light
kind
,
last
a
considerable
time
.
 
<EOS>
at
length
,
a
short
silence
occurring
,
the
young
lady
on
either
side
of
the
young
gentleman
fall
suddenly
fast
asleep
;
and
the
young
gentleman
,
wink
upon
us
to
preserve
silence
,
win
a
pair
of
glove
from
each
,
thereby
cause
them
to
wake
with
equal
suddenness
and
to
scream
very
loud
.
 
<EOS>
the
lively
conversation
to
which
this
pleasantry
give
rise
,
last
for
the
remainder
of
the
ride
,
and
would
have
eke
out
a
much
long
one
.
  
<EOS>
We
dine
rather
more
comfortably
than
people
usually
do
under
such
circumstance
,
nothing
have
be
leave
behind
but
the
cork
-
screw
and
the
bread
.
 
<EOS>
the
married
gentleman
be
unusually
thirsty
,
which
they
attribute
to
the
heat
of
the
weather
;
the
little
boy
eat
to
inconvenience
;
mammas
be
very
jovial
,
and
their
daughter
very
fascinating
;
and
the
attendant
be
well

behave

get
exceedingly
drunk
at
a
respectful
distance

<EOS>
We
have
our
eye
on
Mr
Balim
at
dinner

time
,
and
perceive
that
he
flourish
wonderfully
,
be
still
surround
by
a
little
group
of
young
lady
,
who
listen
to
him
as
an
oracle
,
while
he
eat
from
their
plate
and
drink
from
their
glass
in
a
manner
truly
captivate
from
its
excessive
playfulness
.
 
<EOS>
His
conversation

be
exceedingly
brilliant

<EOS>
in
fact

one
elderly
lady
assure
us
,
that
in
the
course
of
a
little
lively
badinage
on
the
subject
of
lady

he
have
evince
as
much
knowledge
as
if
he
have
be
bear
and
breed
a
milliner
.
  
<EOS>
as
such
of
the
fat
people
who
do
not
happen
to
fall
asleep
after
dinner
enter
upon
a
most
vigorous
game
at
ball
,
we
slip
away
alone
into
a
thick
part
of
the
wood
,
hope
to
fall
in
with
Mr
Balim
,
the
great
part
of
the
young
people
have
drop
off
in
two
and
three
and
the
young
lady
'
young
gentleman
among
them

<EOS>
nor
be
we
disappoint
,
for
we
have
not
walk
far
,
when
,
peep
through
the
tree
,
we
discover
him
before
us
,
and
truly
it
be
a
pleasant
thing
to
contemplate
his
greatness
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
lady
'
young

be
seat
upon
the
ground
,
at
the
foot
of
a
few
young

be
recline

he

so
profusely
deck
with
scarf

riband
,
flower

and
other
pretty

that
he
look
like

or
<EOS>
perhaps
a
calf
would
be
a
better
simile

adorn
for
the
sacrifice

some
choice
specimen
of
vocal

in
praise
of
female
loveliness
,
in
a
style
so
exquisitely
perfect

that
we
burst
into
an
involuntary
shout
of
laughter
,

make
a
hasty
retreat

Conclusion
    
<EOS>
as
we
have
place
before
the
young
lady
so
many
specimen
of
young
gentleman
,
and
have
also
in
the
dedication
of
this
volume
give
them
to
understand
how
much
we
reverence
and
admire
their
numerous
virtue
and
perfection
;
as
we
have
give
them
such
strong
reason
to
treat
us
with
confidence
,
and
to
banish
<EOS>
,
in
our
case
,
all
that
reserve
and
distrust
of
the
male
sex
which
,
as
a
point
of
general
behaviour
,
they
can
not
do
better
than
preserve
and
maintain
---
we
say
,
as
we
have
do
all
this
,
we
feel
that
now
,
when
we
have
arrive
at
the
close
of
our
task
,
they
may
naturally
press
upon
us
the
inquiry
,
what
particular
description
of
young
gentleman
we
can
conscientiously
recommend
.
  
<EOS>
here
we
be
at
a
loss
.
 
<EOS>
We
look
over
our
list
,
and
can
neither
recommend
the
bashful
young
gentleman
,
nor
the
out
-
and
-
out
young
gentleman
,
nor
the
very
friendly
young
gentleman
,
nor
the
military
young
gentleman
,
nor
the
political
young

,
nor
the
domestic
young
gentleman
,
nor
the
censorious
young
gentleman
,
nor
the
funny
young
gentleman
,
nor
the
theatrical
young
gentleman
,
nor
the
poetical
young
gentleman
,
nor
the
throwing
-
off
young
gentleman
,
nor
the
young
lady
'
young
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
as
there
be
some
good
point
about
many
of
them
,
which
still
be
not
sufficiently
numerous
to
render
any
one
among
them
eligible
,
as
a
whole
,
our
respectful
advice
to
the
young
lady
be
,
to
seek
for
a
young
gentleman
who
unite
in
himself
the
good
quality
of
all
,
and
the
bad
weakness
of
none
,
and
to
lead
him
forthwith
to
the
hymeneal
altar
,
whether
he
will
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
and
to
the
young
lady
who
secure
him
,
we
beg
to
tender
one
short
fragment
of
matrimonial
advice
,
select
from
many
sound
passage
of
a
similar
tendency

you

indifferent

from

Most

certain

destructive

<EOS>
that
a
case

a

inform
her
Papa
that
"
she
intend

ally

that
another

a

distressing

a

not

state
her

John

but
,
take
violent
possession
of
her
<EOS>

cousin
<EOS>
,
actually
marry

<EOS>
that
similar
outrage
be
of
constant
occurrence
,
not
only
in
the
capital
and
its
neighbourhood
,
but
throughout
the
kingdom
,
and
that
unless
the
excited
female
populace
be
speedily
check
and
restrain
in
their
lawless
proceeding
,
most
deplorable
result
must
ensue
therefrom
;
among
which
may
be
anticipate
a

increase

with
which
no
effort

<EOS>
that
there
be
strong
reason

suspect
the
existence

a
most
extensive
plot

conspiracy
,
or
design
,
secretly
contrive
by
vast
number
of
single
lady
in
the
United
Kingdom
of
Great
Britain
and
Ireland
,
and
now
extend
its
ramification
in
every
quarter
of
the
land
;
the
object
and
intent
of
which
plainly
appear
to
be
the
holding
and
solemnising
of
an
enormous
and
unprecedented
number
of
marriage
,
on
the
day
on
which
the
nuptial
of
Her
say
Most
Gracious
Majesty
be
perform
.
  
<EOS>
that
such
plot
,
conspiracy
,
or
design
,
strongly
savour
of
Popery
,
as
tend
to
the
discomfiture
of
the
Clergy
of
the
Established
Church
,
by
entail
upon
them
great
mental
and
physical
exhaustion
;
and
that
such
popish
plot
be
fomented
and
encourage
by
Her

Ministers

which
clearly
appear
---
not
only
from
Her

principal
Secretary
of
State
for
Foreign
Affairs
traitorously
get
marry
while
hold
office
under

from
Mr

have
be
hear
to
declare
and
avow
that
,
if
he
have
a
daughter
to
marry
,
she
should
be
marry
on
the
same
day
as
Her
say
Most
Gracious
Majesty
.
  
<EOS>
that
such
arch
plot
,
conspiracy
,
and
design
,
besides
be
fraught
with
danger
to
the
Established
Church
,
and
(
consequently
)
to
the
State
,
can
not
fail
to
bring
ruin
and
bankruptcy
upon
a
large
class
of
Her
Majesty
's
subject
;
as
a
great
and
sudden
increase
in
the
number
of
married
man
occasion
the
comparative
desertion
(
for
a
time
)
of
Taverns
,
Hotels
,
billiard
-
room
,
and
Gaming
-
Houses
,
will
deprive
the
proprietor
of
their
accustomed
profit
and
return
.
 
<EOS>
and
in
further
proof
of
the
depth
and
baseness
of
such
design
,
it
may
be
here
observe
,
that
all
proprietor
of
Taverns
,
Hotels
,
billiard

room

and
Gaming

Houses
,
be
(
especially
the

<EOS>
for
all
these
reason
,
and
many
other
of
no

gravity
and
import
,
an
urgent
appeal
be
make
to
the
gentleman
of
England
(
be
bachelor
or
widower
)
to
take
immediate
step
for
convene
a
public
meeting
;
to
consider
of
the
good
and
sure
mean
of
avert
the
danger
with
which
they
be
threaten
by
the
recurrence
of
Bissextile

Leap
Year
,
and
the
additional
sensation
create
among
single
lady
by
the
term
of
Her

Most
gracious
Declaration
;
to
take
measure
,
without

for
resist
the

single

counteract
their
evil

to

those
distinguish
gentleman

<EOS>
Heaven
alone
can
tell
in
what
bright
colour
this
marriage
be
paint
upon
the
mind

the
little
housemaid
at
number

who
have
hardly
sleep
a
wink
all
night
with
thinking
of
it
,
and
now
stand
on
the
unswept
door

step
lean
upon
her
broom
,
and
look
wistfully
towards
the
enchanted
house
.
 
<EOS>
nothing
short
of
omniscience
can
divine
what
vision
of
the
baker
,
or
the
green
-
grocer
,
or
the
smart
and
most
insinuating
butterman
,
be
flit
across
her
mind
---
what
thought
of
how
she
would
dress
on
such
an
occasion
,
if
she
be
a
lady
---
of
how
she
would
dress
,
if
she
be
only
a

of
how
cook
would
dress
,
be
bridesmaid
,
conjointly
with
her
sister
"
in
place
"
at
Fulham
,
and
how
the
clergyman
,
deem
them
so
many
lady
,
would
be
quite
humbled
and
respectful
.
 
<EOS>
what
day
-
dream
of
hope
and
happiness
---
of
life
be
one
perpetual
holiday
,
with
no
master
and
no
mistress
to
grant
or
withhold
it
---
of
every
Sunday
be
a
Sunday
out
---
of
pure
freedom
as
to
curl
and
ringlet
,
and
no
obligation
to
hide
fine
head
of
hair
in
cap
---
what
picture
of
happiness
,
vast
and
immense
to
her
,
but
utterly
ridiculous
to
us
,
bewilder
the
brain
of
the
little
housemaid
at
number
six
,
all
call
into
existence
by
the
wedding
at
the
corner
!
  
<EOS>
We
smile
at
such
thing
,
and
so
we
should
,
though
perhaps
for
a
well
reason
than
commonly
present
itself
.
 
<EOS>
It
should
be
pleasant
to
us
to
know
that
there
be
notion
of
happiness
so
moderate
and
limited
,
since
upon
those
who
entertain
them
,
happiness
and
lightness
of
heart
be
very
easily
bestow
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
little
housemaid
be
awaken
from
her
reverie
,
for
forth
from
the
door
of
the
magical
corner
house
<EOS>
there

and
there

say
how

there

Miss

and
the

all
smile

quiet
the
child

who
would
cry
more
but
that
they
be
so
finely
dress
,
and
yet
sob
for
fear
sister
Emma
should
be
take
away
---
and
it
be
all
so
affect
,
that
the
two
servant

girl
cry
more
than
anybody
;
and
Jane
Adams
,
sit
down
upon
the
stair
,
when
they
have
creep
away
,
declare
that
her
leg
tremble
so
that
she
do
not
know
what
to
do

and
that
she
will
say
for
Miss

that
she
never
have
a
hasty
word
from
her
,
and
that
she
do
hope
and
pray
she
may
be
happy
.
  
<EOS>
but
Jane
soon
come
round
again
,
and
then
surely
there
never
be
anything
like
the
breakfast
table
,
glitter
with
plate
and
china
,
and
set
out
with
flower
and
sweet
,
and
long

necked
bottle

in
the
most
sumptuous
and
dazzling
manner

<EOS>
in
the
centre

too
,
be
the
mighty
charm
,
the
cake
,
glisten
with
frosted
sugar
,
and
garnish
beautifully
.
 
<EOS>
They
agree
that
there
ought
to
be
a
little
Cupid
under
one
of
the
barley
-
sugar
temple
,
or
at
least
two
heart
and
an
arrow
;
but
,
with
this
exception
,
there
be
nothing
to
wish
for
,
and
a
table
could
not
be
handsome
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
arrive
at
this
conclusion
,
who
should
come
in
but
Mr
John
!
<EOS>
to
whom
Jane
say
that
its
only
Anne
from
number
six

and
John
say
he

for
he
be
often
wink
his
eye
down
the
area
,
which
cause
Anne
to
blush
and
look
confused
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
go
away
,
indeed
;
when
Mr
John
will
have
it
that
she
must
drink
a
glass
of
wine
,
and
he
say
never
mind
<EOS>
it
be
be
early
in
the
morning
<EOS>
,
it
will
not
hurt
her
:
 
<EOS>
so
they
shut
the
door
and
pour
out
the
wine
;
and
Anne
drink
lane
's
health
,
and
add
,
"
<EOS>
and
here
be

Mr

drink
it
in
a
great
many
sip

---
<EOS>
Mr
John
all
the
time
make
joke
appropriate
to
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
at
last
Mr
John
,
who
have
wax
bolder
by
degree
,
plead
the
usage
at
wedding
,
and
claim
the
privilege
of

which
he

after
a
great
scuffle
;
and
footstep

this
time

<EOS>
this
lady
have
be
very
liberal
and
generous
already
,
as
the
jewel
wear
by
the
bride
abundantly
testify
,
but
that
be
nothing
to
what
she
mean
to
do
,
or
even
to
what
she
have
do
,
for
she
put
herself
in
close
communication
with
the
dressmaker
three
month
ago
,
and
prepare
a
wardrobe
(
with
some
article
work
by
her
own
hand
)
fit
for
a
Princess
.
 
<EOS>
People
may
call
her
an
old
maid
,
and
so
she
may
be
,
but
she
be
neither
cross
nor
ugly
for
all
that
;
on
the
contrary
,
she
be
very
cheerful
and
pleasant
-
looking
,
and
very
kind
and
tender
-
hearted
:
 
which
be
no
matter
of
surprise
except
to
those
who
yield
to
popular
prejudice
without
think
why
,
and
will
never
grow
wise
and
never
know
better

<EOS>
of
all
the
company
though
,
none
be
more
pleasant
to
behold
or
better
pleased
with
themselves
than
two
young
child
,
who
,
in
honour
of
the
day
,
have
seat
among
the
guest

<EOS>
of
these

one
be
a
little
fellow
of
six
or
eight
year
old
,
brother
to
the
bride
,
---
and
the
other
a
girl
of
the
same
age
,
or
something
young
,
whom
he
call
"
his
wife
.
"
 
<EOS>
the
real
bride
and
bridegroom
be
not
more
devoted
than
they
:
 
he
all
love
and
attention
,
and
she
all
blush
and
fondness
,
toy
with
a
little
bouquet
which
he
give
her
this
morning
,
and
place
the
scatter
rose
-
leave
in
her
bosom
with
nature
's
own
coquettishness
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
dreamt
of
each
other
in
their
quiet
dream
,
these
child
,
and
their
little
heart
have
be
nearly
break
when
the
absent
one
have
be
dispraise
in
jest
.
<EOS>
when
will
there
come
in
after
-
life
a
passion
so
earnest
,
generous
,
and
true
as
theirs
;
what
,
even
in
its
gentle
reality
,
can
have
the
grace
and
charm
that
hover
round
such
fairy
lover
!
  
<EOS>
by
this
time
the
merriment
and
happiness
of
the
feast
have
gain
their
height
;
certain
ominous
look
begin
to
be
exchange
between
the
bridesmaid
,
and
somehow
it
get
whisper
about
that
the
carriage
which
be
to
take
the
young
couple
into
the
country
have
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
such
member
of
the
party
as
be
most
disposed
to
prolong
its
enjoyment
,
affect
to
consider
this
a
false
alarm
,
but
it
turn
out
too
true
,
be
speedily
confirm
,
first
by
the
retirement
of
the
bride
and
a
select
file
of
intimate
who
be
to
prepare
her
for
the
journey
,
and
secondly
by
the
withdrawal
of
the
lady
generally
.
 
<EOS>
to
this
there
ensue
a
particularly
awkward
pause
,
in
which
everybody
essay
to
be
facetious
,
and
nobody
succeed
;
at
length
the
bridegroom
make
a
mysterious
disappearance
in
obedience
to
some
equally
mysterious
signal
;
and
the
table
be
desert
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
for
at
least
six
week
last
past
it
have
be
solemnly
devise
and
settle
that
the
young
couple
should
go
away
in
secret
;
but
they
no
sooner
appear
without
the
door
than
the

room
window
be
block
up
with
lady
wave
their
handkerchief
and

their

,
and
the

with
gentleman

beam
farewell
in
every
queer
variety
of
its

<EOS>
the

and

with
servant
in
white
favour
,
mix
up
with
particular
friend
and
relation
who
have
dart
out
to
say
good

;
and
foremost
in
the
group
be
<EOS>
the
tiny
lover
arm
in
arm
,
think
,
<EOS>
with
flutter
heart
,
what
happiness
it
would
be
to
dash
away
together
in
that
gallant
coach
,
and
never
part
again
.
  
<EOS>
the
bride
have
barely
time
for
one
hurried
glance
at
her
old
home
,
when
the
step
rattle
,
the
door
slam
,
the
horse
clatter
on
the
pavement

and
they
have
leave
it
far
away

<EOS>
a
knot

six

who
have
make
another
escape
on
some
plea
or
other
,
and
be
an

<EOS>
there
be
two
point
on
which
Anne
expatiate
over
and
over
again
,
without
the
small
appearance
of
fatigue
or
intending

one
be

that

it

the
Formal
Couple
    
<EOS>
the
formal
couple
be
the
most
prim
,
cold
,
immovable
,
and
unsatisfactory
people
on
the
face
of
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
Their
face
,
voice
,
dress

be
all
the
essence
of
formality

<EOS>
everything
with
the
formal

resolve
itself
into
a
matter
of
form

<EOS>
They
do
not
call
upon
you
on
your
account

<EOS>
their
own
;
not
to
see
how
you
be

to
show
how
they
be
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
not
a
ceremony
to
do
honour
to
you
,
but
to
themselves
,
---
not
due
to
your
position
,
but
to
theirs
.
 
<EOS>
if
one
of
a
friend
's
child
die
,
the
formal
couple
be
as
sure
and
punctual
in
send
to
the
house
as
the
undertaker
;
if
a
friend
's
family
be
increase
,
the
monthly
nurse
be
not
more
attentive
than
they

<EOS>
the
formal
couple
,
in
fact
,
joyfully
seize
all
occasion
of
testify
their
good
-
breeding
and
precise
observance
of
the
little
usage
of
society
;
and
for
you
,
who
be
the
mean
to
this
end
,
they
care
as
much
as
a

do
for
the
tailor
who

enable
him
to
cut
a
figure
,
or
a
woman
for
the
milliner
who
have

<EOS>
have
an
extensive
connexion
among
that
kind
of
people
who
make
acquaintance
and
eschew
friend
,
the
formal
gentleman
attend
from
time
to

<EOS>
a
great
many
funeral
,
to
which
he
be
formally
invite
,
and
to
which
he
formally
go
,
as
return
a
call
for
the
last
time
.
 
<EOS>
here
his
deportment
be
of
the
most
faultless
description
;
he
know
the
exact
pitch
of
voice
it
be
proper
to
assume
,
the
sombre
look
he
ought
to
wear
,
the
melancholy
tread
which
should

his
gait
for

<EOS>
He
be
perfectly
acquaint
with
all
the
dreary
courtesy
to
be
observe
in
a
mourning

coach
;
know
when
to
sigh
,
and
when
to
hide
his
nose
in
the
white
handkerchief
;
and
look
into
the
grave
and
shake
his
head
when
the
ceremony
be
conclude

with
the
sad
formality
of
a
mute
.

"
what
kind

funeral

it

say
the

"
oh

reply
the
formal

"
there
never

disgusting
impropriety

there
be
no
feather

"
<EOS>
"
no

cry
the
lady

as
if
on
wing

black
feather
dead
people
fly
to
Heaven
,
and
,
lack
them
<EOS>
,
they
must
of
necessity
go
elsewhere

<EOS>
Her
husband
shake
his
head
;
and
further
add
,
that
they
have
seed
-
cake
instead
of
plum
-
cake
,
and
that
it
be
all
white
wine

<EOS>
"
all

"
exclaim
his

nothing

no

not

<EOS>
"
You
will
recollect
,
my
dear
,
"
say
the
formal
lady
,
in
a
voice
of
stately
reproof
,
"
that
when
we
first
meet
this
poor
man
who
be
now
dead
and
go
,
and
he
take
that
very
strange
course
of
address
me
at
dinner
without
be
previously
introduce
,
I
venture
to
express
my
opinion
that
the
family
be
quite
ignorant
of
etiquette
,
and
very
imperfectly
acquaint
with
the
decency
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
now
have
a
good
opportunity
of
judge
for
yourself
,
and
all
I
have
to
say
be
,
that
I
trust
you
will
never
go
to
a
funeral
there
again
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
reply
the
formal
gentleman
,
"
I
never
will
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
so
the
informal
deceased
be
cut
in
his
grave
;
and
the
formal
couple
,
when
they
tell
the
story
of
the
funeral
,
shake
their
head
,
and
wonder
what
some
people
's
feeling
are
make
of
,
and
what
their
notion
of
propriety
CAN
be
!
  
<EOS>
if
the
formal
couple
have
a
family
(
which
they
sometimes
have
)
,
they
be
not
child
,
but
little
,
pale
,
sour
,
sharp
-
nosed
man
and
woman
;
and
so
exquisitely
bring
up
,
that
they
may
be
very
old
dwarf
for
anything
that
appeareth
to
the
contrary
.
 
<EOS>
indeed
,
they
be
so
acquainted
with
form
and
conventionality
,
and
conduct
themselves
with
such
strict
decorum
,
that
to
see
the
little
girl
break
a
looking
-
glass
in
some
wild
outbreak
,
or
the
little
boy
kick
his
parent
,
would
be
to
any
visitor
an
unspeakable
relief
and
consolation
.
  
<EOS>
the
formal
couple
be
always
stickler
for
what
be
rigidly
proper
,
and
have
a
great
readiness
in
detect
hide
impropriety
of
speech
or
think
,
which
by
less
scrupulous
people
would
be
wholly
unsuspected
.
 
<EOS>
thus
,
if
they
pay
a
visit
to
the
theatre
,
they
sit
all
night
in
a
perfect
agony
lest
anything
improper
or
immoral
should
proceed
from
the
stage
;
and
if
anything
should
happen
to
be
say
which
admit
of
a
double
construction
,
they
never
fail
to
take
it
up
directly
,
and
to
express
by
their
look
the
great
outrage
which
their
feeling
have
sustain
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
this
be
their
chief
reason
for
absent
themselves
almost
entirely
from
place
of
public
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
They
go
sometimes
to
the
exhibition
of
the
Royal
Academy
;
---
but
that
be
often
more
shocking
than
the
stage
itself
,
and
the
formal
lady
think
that
it
really
be
high
time
<EOS>
Mr
Etty
be
prosecute
and
make
a
public
example
of
.
  
<EOS>
We
make
one
at
a
christen
party
not
long
since
,
where
there
be
amongst
the
guest
a
formal
couple
,
who
suffer
the
acute
torture
from
certain
joke
,
incidental
to
such
an
occasion
,
cut
---
and
very
likely
dry
also
---
by
one
of
the
godfather
;
<EOS>
a
red
-
faced
elderly
gentleman
,
who
,
be
highly
popular
with
the
rest
of
the
company
,
have
it
all
his
own
way
,
and
be
in
great
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
at
supper
-
time
that
this
gentleman
come
out
in
full
force
.
 
<EOS>
We
---
be
of
a
grave
and
quiet
demeanour
---
have
be
choose
to
escort
the
formal
lady
down
-
stair
,
and
,
sit
beside
her
,
have
a
favourable
opportunity
of
observe
her
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
,
in
the
very
beginning
,
and
in
the
first
blush
---
literally
the
first
blush
---
of
the
matter
,
the
formal
lady
have
not
feel
quite
certain
whether
the
be
present
at
such
a
ceremony
,
and
encouraging
,
as
it
be
,
the
public
exhibition
of
a
baby
,
be
not
an
act
involve
some
degree
of
indelicacy
and
impropriety
;
but
certain
we
be
that
when
that
baby
's
health
be
drunk
,
and
allusion
be
make
,
by
a
grey
-
head
gentleman
propose
it
,
to
the
time
when
he
have
dandle
in
his
arm
the
young
Christian
's
mother
,
---
<EOS>
certain
we
be
that
then
the
formal
lady
take
the
alarm
,
and
recoil
from
the
old
gentleman
as
from
a
hoary
profligate
.
 
<EOS>
still
she
bear
it
;
she
fan
herself
with
an
indignant
air
,
but
still
she
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
a
comic
song
be
sing
,
involve
a
confession
from
some
imaginary
gentleman
that
he
have
kiss
a
female
,
and
yet
the
formal
lady
bore
it
.
 
<EOS>
but
when
at
last
,
the
health
of
the
godfather
before
-
mention
be
drunk
,
the
godfather
rise
to
return
thank
,
and
in
the
course
of
his
observation
darkly
hint
at
baby
yet
unborn
,
and
even
contemplate
the
possibility
of
the
subject
of
that
festival
have
brother
and
sister
,
the
formal
lady
could
endure
no
more
,
but
,
bow
slightly
round
,
and
sweeping
haughtily
past
the
offender
,
leave
the
room
in
tear
,
under
the
protection
of
the
formal
gentleman
.
    
<EOS>
the
Loving
Couple
    
<EOS>
there
can
not
be
a
well
practical
illustration
of
the
wise
saw
and
ancient
instance
,
that
there
may
be
too
much
of
a
good
thing
,
than
be
present
by
a
love
couple
.
 
<EOS>
undoubtedly
it
be
meet
and
proper
that
two
person
join
together
in
holy
matrimony
should
be
loving
,
and
unquestionably
it
be
pleasant
to
know
and
see
that
they
be
so
;
but
there
be
a
time
for
all
thing
,
and
the
couple
who
happen
to
be
always
in
a
loving
state
before
company
,
be
well
-
nigh
intolerable
.
  
<EOS>
and
in
take
up
this
position
we
would
have
it
distinctly
understand
that
we
do
not
seek
alone
the
sympathy
of
bachelor
,
in
whose
objection
to
love
couple
we
recognise
interested
motive
and
personal
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
We
grant
that
to
that
unfortunate
class
of
society
there
may
be
something
very
irritating
,
tantalise
,
and
provoking
,
in
be
compel
to
witness
those
gentle
endearment
and
chaste
interchange
which
to
love
couple
be
quite
the
ordinary
business
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
but
while
we
recognise
the
natural
character
of
the
prejudice
to
which
these
unhappy
man
be
subject
,
we
can
neither
receive
their
biassed
evidence
,
nor
address
ourself
to
their
inflame
and
anger
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Dispassionate
experience
be
our
only
guide
;
and
in
these
moral
essay
we
seek
no
less
to
reform
hymeneal
offender
than
to
hold
out
a
timely
warning
to
all
rise
couple
,
and
even
to
those
who
have
not
yet
set
forth
upon
their
pilgrimage
towards

and
whisper
her
neighbour
that

unaccustomed

they
be
pretty

or
a
water

party
,

even
more

there
be
a
great
water
-
party
make
up
to
go
to
Twickenham
and
dine
,
and
afterwards
dance
in
an
empty
villa
by
the
river
-
side
,
hire
expressly
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Leaver
be
of
the
company
;
and
it
be
our
fortune
to
have
a
seat
in
the
same
boat
,
which
be
an
eight
-
oare
galley
,
man
by
amateur
,
with
a
blue
stripe
awning
of
the
same
pattern
as
their
Guernsey
shirt
,
and
a
dingy
red
flag
of
the
same
shade
as
the
whisker
of
the
stroke
oar
.
<EOS>
a
coxswain
be
appoint
,
and
all
other
matter
adjust
,
the
eight
gentleman
throw
themselves
into
strong
paroxysm
,
and
pull
up
with
the
tide
,
stimulate
by
the
compassionate
remark
of
the
lady
,
who
one
and
all
exclaim
,
that
it
seem
an
immense
exertion
---
as
indeed
it
do
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
we
race
the
other
boat
,
which
come
alongside
in
gallant
style
;
but
this
be
find
an
unpleasant
amusement
,
as
give
rise
to
a
great
quantity
of
splashing
,
and
render
the
cold
pie
and
other
viand
very
moist
,
it
be
unanimously
vote
down
,
and
we
be
suffer
to
shoot
a
-
head
,
while
the
second
boat
follow
ingloriously
in
our
wake
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
at
this
time
that
we
first
recognise
Mr
Leaver
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
two
fireman
-
waterman
in
the
boat
,
lie
by
until
somebody
be
exhaust
;
and
one
of
them
,
who
have
take
upon
himself
the
direction
of
affair
,
be
hear
to
cry
in
a
gruff
voice
,
"
pull
away
,
number
two
---
give
it
her
<EOS>
,
number
two

take
a
long

---
now
,
number
two
,
sir
,
think
you
be
win
a
boat
.
<EOS>
"
the
great
part
of
the
company
have
no
doubt
begin
to
wonder
which
of
the
stripe
Guernseys
it
may
be
that
stand
in
need
of
such
encouragement
,
when
a
stifled
shriek
from
Mrs
Leaver
confirm
the
doubtful
and
inform
the
ignorant
;
and
Mr
Leaver
,
still
further
disguise
in
a
straw
hat
and
no
neckcloth
,
be
observe
to
be
in
a
fearful
perspiration
,
and
fail
visibly
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
the
general
consternation
diminish
at
this
instant
by
the
same
gentleman
(
in
the
performance
of
an
accidental
aquatic
feat
,
term
"
catch
a
crab
'
)
<EOS>
plunge
suddenly
backward
,
and
display
nothing
of
himself
to
the
company
,
but
two
violently
struggle
leg
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Leaver
shriek
again
several
time
,
and
cry
piteously
---
"
be
he
dead
?
 
<EOS>
tell
me
the
bad
.
 
<EOS>
be
he
dead
?
"
  
<EOS>
now
,
a
moment
's
reflection
may
have
convince
the
loving
wife
,
that
unless
her
husband
be
endow
with
some
most
surprising
power
of
muscular
action
,
he
never
could
be
dead
while
he
kick
so
hard
;
but
still
Mrs
Leaver
cry
,
"
be
he
dead
?
<EOS>
be
he
dead
?
"
<EOS>
and
still
everybody
else
cry
---
"
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
no
,
"
until
such
time
as
Mr
Leaver
be
replace
in
a
sit
posture
,
and
his
oar
(
which
have
be
go
through
all
kind
of
wrong
-
head
performance
on
its
own
account
)
be
once
more
put
in
his
hand
,
by
the
exertion
of
the
two
fireman
-
watermen
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Leaver
then
exclaim
,
"
Augustus
,
my
child
,
come
to
me
;
"
and
Mr
Leaver
say
,
"
Augusta
,
my
love
,
compose
yourself
,
I
be
not
injure
.
"
 
<EOS>
but
Mrs
Leaver
cry
again
more
piteously
than
before
,
"
Augustus
,
my
child
,
come
to
me
;
"
and
now
the
company
generally
,
who
seem
to
be
apprehensive
that
if
Mr
Leaver
remain
where
he
be
,
he
may
contribute
more
than
his
proper
share
towards
the
drowning
of
the
party
,
disinterestedly
take
part
with
Mrs
Leaver
,
and
say
he
really
ought
to
go
,
and
that
he
be
not
strong
enough
for
such
violent
exercise
,
and
ought
never
to
have
undertake
it
.
 
<EOS>
reluctantly
,
Mr
Leaver
go
,
and
lay
himself
down
at
Mrs
Leaver
's
foot
,
and
Mrs
Leaver
stoop
over
him
,
say
,
"
oh
Augustus
,
how
could
you
terrify
me
so
?
"
<EOS>
and
Mr
Leaver
say
,
"
Augusta
,
my
sweet
<EOS>
,
I
never
mean
to
terrify
you
;
"
and
Mrs
Leaver
say
,
"
You
be
faint
,
my
dear
;
"
and
Mr
Leaver
say
,
"
I
be
rather
so
,
my
love
;
"
and
they
be
very
loving
indeed
under
Mrs
Leaver
's
veil
,
until
at
length
<EOS>
Mr
Leaver
come
forth
again
,
and
pleasantly
ask
if
he
have
not
hear
something
say
about
bottled
stout
and
sandwich
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Starling
,
who
be
one
of
the
party
,
be
perfectly
delighted
with
this
scene
,
and
frequently
murmur
half
-
aside
,
"
what
a
love
couple
you
be
!
"
<EOS>
or
"
how
delightful
it
be
to
see
man
and
wife
so
happy
together
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
to
us
she
be
quite
poetical
,
(
for
we
be
a
kind
of
cousin
,
)
observe
that
heart
beat
in
unison
like
that
make
life
a
paradise
of
sweet
;
and
that
when
kindred
creature
be
draw
together
by
sympathy
so
fine
and
delicate
,
what
more
than
mortal
happiness
do
not
our
soul
partake
!
 
<EOS>
to
all
this
we
answer
"
certainly
,
"
or
"
very
true
,
"
or
merely
sigh
,
as
the
case
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
at
every
new
act
of
the
love
couple
,
the
widow
's
admiration
break
out
afresh
;
and
when
Mrs
Leaver
would
not
permit
Mr
Leaver
to
keep
his
hat
off
,
lest
the
sun
should
strike
to
his
head
,
and
give
him
a
brain
fever
,
Mrs
Starling
actually
shed
tear
,
and
say
it
remind
her
of
Adam
and
Eve
.
  
<EOS>
the
love
couple
be
thus
love
all
the
way
to
Twickenham
,
but
when
we
arrive
there
(
by
which
time
the
amateur
crew
look
very
thirsty
and
vicious
)
<EOS>
they
be
more
playful
than
ever
,
for
Mrs
Leaver
throw
stone
at
Mr
Leaver
,
and
Mr
Leaver
run
after
Mrs
Leaver
on
the
grass
,
in
a
most
innocent
and
enchanting
manner
.
 
<EOS>
at
dinner
,
too
,
Mr
Leaver
WOULD
steal
Mrs
Leaver
's
tongue
,
and
Mrs
Leaver
WOULD
retaliate
upon
Mr
Leaver
's
fowl
;
and
when
Mrs
Leaver
be
go
to
take
some
lobster
salad
,
Mr
Leaver
would
not
let
her
have
any
,
say
that
it
make
her
ill
,
and
she
be
always
sorry
for
it
afterwards
,
which
afford
Mrs
Leaver
an
opportunity
of
pretend
to
be
cross
,
and
show
many
other
prettiness
.
 
<EOS>
but
this
be
merely
the
smile
surface
of
their
love
,
not
the
mighty
depth
of
the
stream
,
down
to
which
the
company
,
to
say
the
truth
,
dive
rather
unexpectedly
,
from
the
follow
accident
.
 
<EOS>
It
chance
that
Mr
Leaver
take
upon
himself
to
propose
the
bachelor
who
have
first
originate
the
notion
of
that
entertainment
,
in
do
which
,
he
affect
to
regret
that
he
be
no
long
of
their
body
himself
,
and
pretend
grievously
to
lament
his
fall
state
.
 
<EOS>
this
Mrs
Leaver
's
feeling
could
not
brook
,
even
in
jest
,
and
consequently
,
exclaim
aloud
,
"
He
love
me
not
,
he
love
me
not
!
"
<EOS>
she
fall
in
a
very
pitiable
state
into
the
arm
of
Mrs
Starling
,
and
,
directly
become
insensible
,
be
convey
by
that
lady
and
her
husband
into
another
room
.
 
<EOS>
presently
Mr
Leaver
come
run
back
to
know
if
there
be
a
medical
gentleman
in
company
,
and
as
there
be
,
(
in
what
company
be
there
not
?
)
<EOS>
both
Mr
Leaver
and
the
medical
gentleman
hurry
away
together
.
  
<EOS>
the
medical
gentleman
be
the
first
who
return
,
and
among
his
intimate
friend
he
be
observe
to
laugh
and
wink
,
and
look
as
unmedical
as
may
be
;
but
when
Mr
Leaver
come
back
he
be
very
solemn
,
and
in
answer
to
all
inquiry
,
shake
his
head
,
and
remark
that
Augusta
be
far
too
sensitive
to
be
trifle
with
---
an
opinion
which
the
widow
subsequently
confirm
.
 
<EOS>
find
that
she
be
in
no
imminent
peril
,
however
,
the
rest
of
the
party
betook
themselves
to
dance
on
the
green
,
and
very
merry
and
happy
they
be
,
and
a
vast
quantity
of
flirtation
<EOS>
there
be
;
<EOS>
the
last
circumstance
be
no
doubt
attributable
,
partly
to
the
fineness
of
the
weather
,
and
partly
to
the
locality
,
which
be
well
known
to
be
favourable
to
all
harmless
recreation
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
bustle
of
the
scene
,
Mr
and
Mrs
Leaver
steal
down
to
the
boat
,
and
dispose
themselves
under
the
awning
,
Mrs
Leaver
recline
her
head
upon
Mr
Leaver
's
shoulder
,
and
Mr
Leaver
grasp
her
hand
with
great
fervour
,
and
look
in
her
face
from
time
to
time
with
a
melancholy
and
sympathetic
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
the
widow
sit
apart
,
feign
to
be
occupy
with
a
book
,
but
stealthily
observe
them
from
behind
her
fan
;
and
the
two
fireman
-
waterman
,
smoke
their
pipe
on
the
bank
hard
by
,
nudge
each
other
,
and
grin
in
enjoyment
of
the
joke
.
 
<EOS>
very
few
of
the
party
miss
the
love
couple
;
and
the
few
who
do
,
heartily
congratulate
each
other
on
their
disappearance
.
    
<EOS>
the
Contradictory
Couple
    
one
would
suppose
that
two
people
who
be
to
pass
their
whole
life
together
,
and
must
necessarily
be
very
often
alone
with
each
other
,
could
find
little
pleasure
in
mutual
contradiction
;
and
yet
what
be
more
common
than
a
contradictory
couple
?
  
<EOS>
the
contradictory
couple
agree
in
nothing
but
contradiction
.
 
<EOS>
They
return
home
from
Mrs
Bluebottle
's
dinner
-
party
,
each
in
an
opposite
corner
of
the
coach
,
and
do
not
exchange
a
syllable
until
they
have
be
seat
for
at
least
twenty
minute
by
the
fireside
at
home
,
when
the
gentleman
,
raise
his
eye
from
the
stove
,
all
at
once
break
silence
:
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
very
extraordinary
thing
it
be
,
"
say
he
,
"
that
you
WILL
contradict
,
Charlotte
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I

"
<EOS>
cry
the
lady
,
"
but
that
be
just
like
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
what
be
like
me
?
"
say
the
gentleman
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
say
that
I

you
,
"
reply
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
do
not
contradict
me
?
"
<EOS>
retort
the
gentleman
;
"
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
not
be
contradict
me
the
whole
of
this
day
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
now
,
that
you
have
not

<EOS>
I
mean
to
tell
you
nothing
of
the
kind
,
"
reply
the
lady
quietly
;
"
when
you
be
wrong
,
of
course
I
shall
contradict
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
during
this
dialogue
the
gentleman
have
be
take
his
brandy
-
and
-
water
on
one
side
of
the
fire
,
and
the
lady
,
with
her
dressing

case
on
the
table
,
have
be
curl
her
hair
on
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
She
now
let
down
her
back
hair
,
and
proceed
to
brush
it
;
preserve
at
the
same
time
an
air
of
conscious
rectitude
and
suffering
virtue
,
which
be
intend
to
exasperate
the
gentleman
---
and
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
believe
,
"
he
say
,
take
the
spoon
out
of
his
glass
,
and
toss
it
on
the
table
,
"
that
of
all
the
obstinate

positive

to

anybody

would
be
no

I
say
again

that
I
believe
Mrs

more

<EOS>
nay

I
believe
you

with

the

the

the

in

they
be
equally
the

equally
a

to
their

the

They

They
recollect
the

because
on
that
day
little
Tom
fall
down
the
kitchen

the
anniversary
of

Mrs

Time

as

They

whatever

Mr

such
excruciating

constantly

nobody

such
amazing
health

such
an
indomitable
constitution

<EOS>
such
a

His

perhaps
this
may
be
an
extreme
case

one
not

Mr

why

<EOS>
now

this

the

Will

with

"
 
<EOS>
"
then

the

<EOS>
let
us

wish
her
well

"
  
<EOS>
Doctor
Johnson
use
to
tell
a
story
of
a
man
who
have
but
one
idea
,
which
be
a
wrong
one
.
 
<EOS>
the
couple
who
dote
upon
their
child
be
in
the
same
predicament
:
 
at
home
or
abroad
,
at
all
time
,
and
in
all
place
,
their
thought
be
bind
up
in
this
one
subject
,
and
have
no
sphere
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
They
relate
the
clever
thing
their
offspring
say
or
do
,
and
weary
every
company
with
their
prolixity
and
absurdity
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Whiffler
take
a
friend
by
the
button
at
a
street
corner
on
a
windy
day
to
tell
him
a
BON
mot
of
his
young
boy
be
;
and
Mrs
Whiffler
,
call
to
see
a
sick
acquaintance
,
entertain
her
with
a
cheerful
account
of
all
<EOS>
her
own
past
suffering
and
present
expectation
.
 
<EOS>
in
such
case
the
sin
of
the
father
indeed
descend
upon
the
child
;
for
people
soon
come
to
regard
them
as
predestined
little
bore
.
 
<EOS>
the
couple
who
dote
upon
their
child
can
not
be
say
to
be
actuate
by
a
general
love
for
these
engage
little
people
(
which
would
be
a
great
excuse
)
;
for
they
be
apt
to
underrate
and
entertain
a
jealousy
of
any
child
but
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
examine
their
own
heart
,
they
would
,
perhaps
,
find
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
,
more
self
-
love
and
egotism
than
they
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
self
-
love
and
egotism
be
bad
quality
,
of
which
the
unrestrained
exhibition
,
though
it
may
be
sometimes
amusing
,
never
fail
to
be
wearisome
and
unpleasant
.
 
<EOS>
couple
who
dote
upon
their
child
,
therefore
,
be
best
avoid
.
    
<EOS>
the
Cool
Couple
    
<EOS>
there
be
an
old

fashioned
weather

glass
represent
a
house
with
two
doorway
,
in
one
of
which
be
the
figure
of
a
gentleman
,
in
the
other
the
figure
of
a
lady

<EOS>
when
the
weather
be
to
be
fine
the
lady
come
out
and
the
gentleman
go
in
;
when
wet
,
the
gentleman
come
out
and
the
lady
go
in
.
 
<EOS>
They
never
seek
each
other
's
society
,
be
never
elevate
and
depress
by
the
same
cause
,
and
have
nothing
in
common
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
the
model
of
a
cool
couple
,
except
that
there
be
something
of
politeness
and
consideration
about
the
behaviour
of
the
gentleman
in
the
weather
-
glass
,
in
which
,
neither
of
the
cool
couple
can
be
say
to
participate
.
  
<EOS>
the
cool
couple
be
seldom
alone
together
,
and
when
they
be
,
nothing
can
exceed
their
apathy
and
dulness
:
 
<EOS>
the
gentleman
be
for
the
most
part
drowsy
,
and
the
lady
silent
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
enter
into
conversation
,
it
be
usually
of
an
ironical
or
recriminatory
nature
.
<EOS>
thus
,
when
the
gentleman
have
indulge
in
a
very
long
yawn
and
settle
himself
more
snugly
in
his
easy
-
chair
,
the
lady
will
perhaps
remark
,
"
well
,
I
be
sure
,
Charles
!
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
be
comfortable
.
"
 
<EOS>
to
which
the
gentleman
reply
,
"
oh
yes

he
be
quite
comfortable
quite

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
there
be
not
many
married

I

return
the

who
seek
comfort
in
such
selfish
gratification
as
you
do

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
nor
many
wife
who
seek
comfort
in
such
selfish
gratification

you

retort
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
whose
fault
be
that
?
<EOS>
"
demand
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
the
gentleman
become
more
sleepy
,
return
no
answer
.
 
<EOS>
"
whose
fault
be
that
?
"
<EOS>
the
lady
repeat
.
 
<EOS>
the
gentleman
still
return
no
answer
,
she
go
on
to
say
that
she
believe
there
never
be
in
all
this
world
<EOS>
anybody
so
attach
to
her
home
,
so
thoroughly
domestic
<EOS>
,
so
unwilling
to
seek
a
moment
's
gratification
or
pleasure
beyond
her
own
fireside
as
she
.
 
<EOS>
God
know
that
before
she
be
marry
she
never
think
or
dreamt
of
such
a
thing
;
and
she
remember
that
her
poor
papa
use
to
say
again
and
again
,
almost
every
day
of
his
life
,
"
oh
,
my
dear
Louisa
,
if
you
only
marry
a
man
who
understand
you
,
and
take
the
trouble
to
consider
your
happiness
and
accommodate
himself
a
very
little
to
your
disposition
,
what
a
treasure
he
will
find
in
you
!
"
<EOS>
She
suppose
her
papa
know
what
her
disposition
be
---
he
have
know
her
long
enough
---
he
ought
to
have
be
acquaint
with
it
,
but
what
can
she
do
?
 
<EOS>
if
her
home
be
always
dull
and
lonely
,
and
her
husband
be
always
absent
and
find
no
pleasure
in
her
society
,
she
be
naturally
sometimes
drive
(
seldom
enough
,
she
be
sure
)
to
seek
a
little
recreation
elsewhere
;
she
be
not
expect
to
pine
and
mope
to
death
,
she
hope
.
 
<EOS>
"
then
come
,
Louisa
,
"
say
the
gentleman
,
wake
up
as
suddenly
as
he
fall
asleep
,
"
stop
at
home
this
evening
,
and
so
will
I.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
sorry
to
suppose
,
Charles
,
that
you
take
a
pleasure
in
aggravate
me
,
"
reply
the
lady
;
"
but
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
that
I
be
particularly
engage
to
Mrs
Mortimer

and
that
it
would
be
an
act
of
the
gross
rudeness

ill

breeding

after
accept
a
seat
in
her
box

prevent

there
it

the

shrug
his

I
know
that
perfectly
well

<EOS>
I
know
you
could
not
devote
an
evening
to
your
own

<EOS>
now
all
I
have
to
say
,
Louisa
,
be
this
---
<EOS>
recollect
that
I
be
quite
willing
to
stay
at
home
,
and
that
it
be
no
fault
of
MINE
<EOS>
we
be
not
oftener
together

"
  
<EOS>
with
that
the
gentleman
go
away
to
keep
an
old
appointment
at
his
club
,
and
the
lady
hurry
off
to
dress
for
Mrs
Mortimer
's
;
and
neither
think
of
the
other
until
by
some
odd
chance
they
find
themselves
alone
again
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
must
not
be
suppose
that
the
cool
couple
be
habitually
a
quarrelsome
one

<EOS>
quite
the
contrary

<EOS>
these
difference
be
only
occasion
for
a
little
self
-
excuse

nothing
more

<EOS>
in
general
they
be
as
easy
and
careless
,
and
dispute
as
seldom
,
as
any
common
acquaintance
may
;
for
it
be
neither
worth
their
while

put
each

out

the

in

languid
tone

I

Dover

up

all
the

nod
slightly

I

I

It

it

always
come

It

very
provoking

tiresome

I
be
sure
when
he
leave
me
so
much
alone
for
his

the

he
could
do
would
be
to
do

observe

the

come

make
a
merit

arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
it

the
very

hope

determine

thus

they
elevate
their

the
Plausible

<EOS>
the

have
many
title

<EOS>
They
be
"
a
delightful
couple
,
"
an
"
affectionate
couple
,
"
"
a
most
agreeable
couple
,
"
a
good

hearted
couple

and
"
the
best

natured
couple
in
existence

<EOS>
"
the
truth
be
,
that
the
plausible
couple
be
people
of
the
world
;
and
either
the
way
of
please
the
world
have
grow
much
easy
than
it
be
in
the
day
of
the
old
man
and
his
ass
,
or
the
old
man
be
but
a
bad
hand
at
it
,
and
know
very
little
of
the
trade
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
be
it
really
possible
to
please
the
world
!
"
say
some
doubt
reader
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
it
be
not
only
very
possible
,
but
very
easy
.
 
<EOS>
the
way
be
crooked
,
and
sometimes
foul
and
low
.
 
<EOS>
what
then
?
 
<EOS>
a
man
need
but
crawl
upon
his
hand
and
knee
,
know
when
to
close
his
eye
and
when
his
ear
,
when
to
stoop
and
when
to
stand
upright
;
and
if
by
the
world
be
mean
that
atom
of
it
in
which
he
move
himself
,
he
shall
please
it
,
never
fear
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
it
will
be
readily
see
,
that
if
a
plausible
man
or
woman
have
an
easy
mean
of
please
the
world
by
an
adaptation
of
self
to
all
its
twisting
and
twining
,
a
plausible
man
and
woman
,
or
,
in
other
word
,
a
plausible

,
play
into

other
's
hand
,
and
act
in
concert
,
have
a
manif
advantage

<EOS>
hence
it
be
that
plausible

scarcely
ever
fail
of
success
on
a
pretty
large
scale
;
and
hence
it
be
that
if
the
reader
,
lay
down
this
unwieldy
volume
at
the
next
full
stop
,
will
have
the
goodness
to
review
his
or
her
circle
of
acquaintance
,
and
to
search
particularly
for
some
man
and
wife
with
a
large
connexion
and
a
good
name
,
not
easily
referable
to
their
ability
or
their
wealth
,
he
or
she
(
that
is

the
male
or
female
reader

will
certainly
find
that
gentleman

on
a
very
short
reflection
,
to
be
a
plausible
couple

the

nothing

the

They

book
both
family

next
party

and
Mr
Widger
,
go
on
to
expatiate
upon
the
virtue
of
the
Clickits
,
add
to
their
other
moral
quality
,
that
they
keep
one
of
the
neatest
phaeton
in
town
,
and
have
two
thousand
a
year
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
plausible
couple
never
laud
the
merit
of
any
absent
person
,
without
dexterously
contrive
that
their
praise
shall
reflect
upon
somebody
who
be
present
,
so
they
never
depreciate
anything
or
anybody
,
without
turn
their
depreciation
to
the
same
account
.
<EOS>
Their
friend
,
Mr
Slummery
,
say
they
,
be
unquestionably
a
clever
painter
,
and
would
no
doubt
be
very
popular
,
and
sell
his
picture
at
a
very
high
price
,
if
that
cruel
Mr
Fithers
have
not
forestall
him
in
his
department
of
art
,
and
make
it
thoroughly
and
completely
his
own
;
<EOS>

fither
,
it
be
to
be
observe
,
be
present
and
within
hearing
,
and
Slummery
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
be
Mrs
Tabblewick
really
as
beautiful
as
people
say
?
 
<EOS>
why
,
there
indeed
you
ask
them
a
very
puzzling
question
,
because
there
be
no
doubt
that
she
be
a
very
charming
woman
,
and
they
have
long
know
her
intimately
.
 
<EOS>
She
be
no
doubt
beautiful
,
very
beautiful
;
they
once
think
her
the
most
beautiful
woman
ever
see
;
still
if
you
press
them
for
an
honest
answer
,
they
be
bind
to
say
that
this
be
before
they
have
ever
see
our
lovely
friend
on
the
sofa
,
(
the
sofa
be
hard
by
,
and
our
lovely
friend
can
not
help
hear
the
whisper
in
which
this
be
say
;
)
<EOS>
since
that
time
,
perhaps
,
they
have
be
hardly
fair
judge
;
Mrs
Tabblewick
be
no
doubt
extremely
handsome
,
---
very
like
our
friend
,
in
fact
,
in
the
form
of
the
feature

in
point
of
expression
,
and
soul
,
and
figure
,
and
air
altogether
---
<EOS>
oh
dear
!
  
<EOS>
but
while
the
plausible
couple
depreciate
,
they
be
still
careful
to
preserve
their
character
for
amiability
and
kind
feeling
;
indeed
the
depreciation
itself
be
often
make
to
grow
out
of
their
excessive
sympathy
and
good
will

not

<EOS>
accordingly
he
be
very
proud
of
his
well
-
half
,
and
evidently
consider
himself
,
as
all
other
people
consider
him
,
rather
fortunate
in
have
her
to
wife
.
 
<EOS>
We
say
evidently
,
because
Mr
Chirrup
be
a
warm
-
hearted
little
fellow
;
and
if
you
catch
his
eye
when
he
have
be
slyly
glance
at
Mrs
Chirrup
in
company
,
there
be
a
certain
complacent
twinkle
in
it
,
accompany
,
perhaps
,
by
a
half
-
express
toss
of
the
head
,
which
as
clearly
indicate
what
have
be
pass
in
his
mind
as
if
he
have
put
it
into
word
,
and
shout
it
out
through
a
speaking
-
trumpet
.
<EOS>
moreover
,
Mr
Chirrup
have
a
particularly
mild
and
bird
-
like
manner
of
call
Mrs
Chirrup
"
my
dear
;
"
and
---
for
he
be
of
a
jocose
turn
---
of
cut
little
witticism
upon
her
,
and
make
her
the
subject
of
various
harmless
pleasantry
,
which
nobody
enjoy
more
thoroughly
than
Mrs
Chirrup
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Chirrup
,
too
,
now
and
then
affect
to
deplore
his
bachelor
-
day
,
<EOS>
and
to
bemoan
(
with
a
marvellously
contented
and
smirk
face
)
the
loss
of
his
freedom
,
and
the
sorrow
of
his
heart
at

be
take
captive
by
Mrs
Chirrup
---
all
of
which
circumstance
combine
to
show
the
secret
triumph
and
satisfaction
of
Mr
Chirrup
's
soul
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
already
have
occasion
to
observe
that
Mrs
Chirrup
be
an
incomparable
housewife

all
the
art
of

in
muslin
and
fine

and
a
special

but
if
there
be
one
branch
of
housekeeping
in
which
she
excel
to
an
utterly
unparalleled
and
unprecedented
extent
,
it
be
in
the

to
be
the
great
stumbling

block
in

of

You

<EOS>
to

Mr

be
one
of
the
pleasantest
thing
in

<EOS>
Mr
Chirrup
have
a
bachelor
friend
,
who
live
with
him
in
his
own
day
of
single
blessedness

and
to
whom

<EOS>
Contrary
to
the
usual
custom
,
this
bachelor
friend
be
no
less
a
friend
of
Mrs
Chirrup
's
,
and
,
consequently
,
whenever
you
dine
with
Mr
and
Mrs
Chirrup
,
you
meet
the
bachelor
friend
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
put
any
reasonably
-
condition
mortal
into
good
-
humour
to
observe
the
entire
unanimity
which
subsist
between
these
three
;
but
there
be
a
quiet
welcome
dimpling
in
Mrs
Chirrup
's
face
,
a
bustling
hospitality
ooze
as
it
be
out
of
the
waistcoat

pocket
of
Mr
Chirrup
,
and
a
patronising
enjoyment
of
their
cordiality
and
satisfaction
on
the
part
of
the
bachelor
friend
,
which
be
quite
delightful
.
 
<EOS>
on
these
occasion
Mr
Chirrup
usually
take
an
opportunity
of
rally
the
friend
on
be
single
,
and
the
friend
retort
on
Mr
Chirrup
for
be
marry
,
at
which
moment
some
single
young
lady
present
be
like
to
die
of
laughter
;
and
we
have
more
than
once
observe
them
bestow
look
upon
the
friend
,
which
convince
us
that
his
position
be
by
no
mean
a
safe
one
,
as
,
indeed
<EOS>
,
we
hold
no
bachelor
's
to
be
who
visit
married
friend
and
crack
joke
on
wedlock
,
<EOS>
for
certain
it
be
that
such
man
walk
among
trap
and
net
and
pitfall
innumerable
,
and
often
find
themselves
down
upon
their
knee
at
the
altar
rail
,
take
M
or
N
for
their
wed
wife
,
before
they
know
anything
about
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
this
be
no
business
of
Mr
Chirrup
's
,
who
talk
,
and
laugh
,
and
drink
his
wine
,
and
laugh
again
,
and
talk
more
,
until
it
be
time
to
repair
to
the
drawing

room
,
where
,
coffee
serve
and
over
,
Mrs
Chirrup
prepare
for
a
round
game
,
by
sort
the
nice
possible
little
fish
into
the
nice
possible
little
pool
,
and
call
Mr
Chirrup
to
assist
her
,
which
Mr
Chirrup
do
.
 
<EOS>
as
they
stand
side
by
side
,
you
find
that
Mr
Chirrup
be
the
least
possible
shadow
of
a
shade
tall
than
Mrs
Chirrup
,
and
that
they
be
the
neat
and
best
-
match
little
couple
that
can
be
,
which
the
chance
be
ten
to
one
against
your
observing
with
such
effect
at
any
other
time
,
unless
you
see
them
in
the
street
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
or
meet
them
some
rainy
day
trot
along
under
a
very
small
umbrella
.
 
<EOS>
the
round
game
(
at
which
Mr
Chirrup
be
the
merry
of
the
party
)
be
do
and
over
,
in
course
of
time
a
nice
little
tray
appear
,
on
which
be
a
nice
little
supper
;
and
when
that
be
finish
likewise
,
and
you
have
say
"
good
night
,
"
you
find
yourself
repeat
a
dozen
time
,
as
you
ride
home
,
that
there
never
be
such
a
nice
little
couple
as
Mr
and
Mrs
Chirrup
.
  
<EOS>
whether
it
be
that
pleasant
quality
,
be
pack
more
closely
in
small
body
than
in
large
,
come
more
readily
to
hand
than
when
they
be
diffuse
over
a
wide
space
,
and
have
to
be
gather
together
for
use
,
we
do
not
know
,
but
<EOS>
as
a
general
rule
,
---
strengthen
like
all
other
rule
by
its
exception
,
---
we
hold
that
little
people
be
sprightly
and
good

natured
.
 
<EOS>
the
more
sprightly
and
good
-
natured
people
we
have
,
the
well
;
therefore
,
let
us
wish
well
to
all
nice
little
couple
,
and
hope
that
they
may
increase
and
multiply
.
    
<EOS>
the
Egotistical
Couple
    
egotism
in
couple
be
of
two
kind
.
<EOS>
---
It
be
our
purpose
to
show
this
by
two
example
.
  
<EOS>
the
egotistical
couple
may
be
young
,
old
,
middle
-
aged
,
well
to
do
,
or
ill
to
do
;
they
may
have
a
small
family
,
a
large
family
,
or
no
family
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
outward
sign
by
which
an
egotistical
couple
may
be
know
and
avoid
.
 
<EOS>
They
come
upon
you
unawares
;
there
be
no
guard
against
them
.
 
<EOS>
no
man
can
of
himself
be
forewarn
or
forearm
against
an
egotistical
couple
.
  
<EOS>
the
egotistical
couple
have
undergo
every
calamity
,
and
experience
every
pleasurable
and
painful
sensation
of
which
our
nature
be
susceptible
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
by
possibility
tell
the
egotistical
couple
anything
they
do
not
know
,
or
describe
to
them
anything
they
have
not
feel
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
be
everything
but
dead
.
<EOS>
sometimes
we
be
tempt
to
wish
they
have
be
even
that
,
but
only
in
our
uncharitable
moment
,
which
be
few
and
far
between
.
  
<EOS>
We
happen
the
other
day
,
in
the
course
of
a
morning
call
,
to
encounter
an
egotistical
couple
,
nor
be
we
suffer
to
remain
long
in
ignorance
of
the
fact
,
for
our
very
first
inquiry
of
the
lady
of
the
house
bring
them
into
active
and
vigorous
operation
.
<EOS>
the
inquiry
be
of
course
touch
the
lady
's
health
,
and
the
answer
happen
to
be
,
that
she
have
not
be
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
"
oh
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
egotistical
lady
,
"
do
not
talk
of
not
be
well
.
<EOS>
We
have
be
in
SUCH
a
state
since
we
see
you
last
!
"
<EOS>
---
the
lady
of
the
house
happen
to
remark
that
her
lord
have
not
be
well
either
,
the
egotistical
gentleman
strike
in
:
 
"
never
let
Briggs
complain
of
not
be
well
---
never
let
Briggs
complain
,
my
dear
Mrs
Briggs
,
after
what
I
have
undergo
within
these
six
week
.
<EOS>
He
do
not
know
what
it
be
to
be
ill
,
he
have
not
the
least
idea
of
it
;
not
the
faint
conception
.
"
<EOS>
---
"
My
dear
,
"
interpose
his
wife
smile
,
"
you
talk
as
if
it
be
almost
a
crime
in
Mr
Briggs
not
to
have
be
as
ill
as
we
have
be
,
instead
of
feel
thankful
to
Providence
that
both
he
and
our
dear
Mrs
Briggs
be
in
such
blissful
ignorance
of
real
suffering
.
"
<EOS>
---
"
My
love
,
"
return
the
egotistical
gentleman
,
in
a
low
and
pious
voice
,
"
you
mistake
me
;
---
I
feel
grateful
---
very
grateful
.
 
<EOS>
I
trust
our
friend
may
never
purchase
their
experience
as
dearly
as
we
have
buy
our
;
I
hope
they
never
may
!
"
  
<EOS>
have
put
down
Mrs
Briggs
upon
this
theme
,
and
settle
the
question
thus
,
the
egotistical
gentleman
turn
to
us
,
and
,
after
a
few
preliminary
remark
,
all
tend
towards
and
lead
up
to
the
point
he
have
in
his
mind
,
inquire
if
we
happen
to
be
acquaint
with
the
Dowager
Lady
Snorflerer
.
 
<EOS>
on
our
replying
in
the
negative
,
he
presume
we
have
often
meet
Lord
Slang
,
or
beyond
all
doubt
,
that
we
be
on
intimate
term
with
Sir
Chipkins
Glogwog
.
 
<EOS>
find
that
we
be
equally
unable
to
lay
claim
to
either
of
these
distinction
,
he
express
great
astonishment
,
and
turn
to
his
wife
with
a
retrospective
smile
,
inquire
who
it
be
that
have
tell
that
capital
story
about
the
mashed
potato
.
 
<EOS>
"
who
,
my
dear
?
"
return
the
egotistical
lady
,
"
why
Sir
Chipkins
,
of
course
;
how
can
you
ask
!
 
<EOS>
do
not
you
remember
his
apply
it
to
our
cook
,
and
say
that
you
and
I
be
so
like
the
Prince
and
Princess
,
that
he
could
almost
have
swear
we
be
they
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
,
I
remember
that
,
"
say
the
egotistical
gentleman
,
"
but
be
you
quite
certain
that
do
not
apply
to
the
other
anecdote
about
the
Emperor
of
Austria
and
the
pump
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
upon
my
word
then
,
I
think
it
do
,
"
reply
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
"
to
be
sure
it
do
,
"
say
the
egotistical
gentleman
,
"
it
be
Slang
's
story
,
<EOS>
I
remember
now
,
perfectly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
however
,
it
turn
out
,
a
few
second
afterwards
,
that
the
egotistical
gentleman
's
memory
be
rather
treacherous
,
as
he
begin
to
have
a
misgiving
that
the
story
have
be
tell
by
the
Dowager
Lady
Snorflerer
the
very
last
time
they
dine
there
;
but
there
appear
,
on
further
consideration
,
strong
circumstantial
evidence
tend
to
show
that
this
could
not
be
,
inasmuch
as
the
Dowager
Lady
Snorflerer
have
be
,
on
the
occasion
in
question
,
wholly
engross
by
the
egotistical
lady
,
the
egotistical
gentleman
recant
this
opinion
;
and
after
lay
the
story
at
the
door
of
a
great
many
great
people
,
happily
leave
it
at
last
with
the
Duke
of
Scuttlewig
:
---
observe
that
it
be
not
extraordinary
he
have
forget
his
grace
hitherto
,
as
it
often
happen
that
the
name
of
those
with
whom
we
be
upon
the
most
familiar
footing
be
the
very
last
to
present
themselves
to
our
thought
.
  
<EOS>
It
not
only
appear
that
the
egotistical
couple
know
everybody
,
but
that
scarcely
any
event
of
importance
or
notoriety
have
occur
for
many
year
with
which
they
have
not
be
in
some
way
or
other
connect
.
 
<EOS>
thus
we
learn
that
when
the
well
-
know
attempt
upon
the
life
of
George
the
Third
be
make
by
Hatfield
in
Drury
Lane
theatre
,
the
egotistical
gentleman
's
grandfather
sit
upon
his
right
hand
and
be
the
first
man
who
collar
him
;
and
that
the
egotistical
lady
's
aunt
,
sit
within
a
few
box
of
the
royal
party
,
be
the
only
person
in
the
audience
who
hear
his
Majesty
exclaim
,
"
Charlotte
,
Charlotte
,
do
not
be
frightened
,
do
not
be
frightened
;
they
be
let
off
squibs
,
they
be
let
off
squibs
.
"
 
<EOS>
when
the
fire
break
out
,
which
end
in
the
destruction
of
the
two
Houses
of
Parliament
,
the
egotistical
couple
,
be
at
the
time
at
a
drawing
-
room
window
on
Blackheath
,
then
and
there
simultaneously
exclaim
,
to
the
astonishment
of
a
whole
party
---
"
It
be
the
House
of
Lords
!
"
 
<EOS>
nor
be
this
a
solitary
instance
of
their
peculiar
discernment
,
for
chancing
to
be
(
as
by
a
comparison
of
date
and
circumstance
they
afterwards
find
)
in
the
same
omnibus
with
Mr
Greenacre
,
<EOS>
when
he
carry
his
victim
's
head
about
town
in
a
blue
bag
,
they
both
remark
a
singular
twitching
in
the
muscle
of
his
countenance
;
and

and

<EOS>
unwilling

that
she

would
like
to
see

and
that
she
be
determined
to
make
a
trial
for
you
,
as

a
great
favourite
.
 
<EOS>
so
you
be
lead
up
-
stair
---
still
on
tip
-
toe
---
to
the
door
of
a
little
back
room
,
in
which
,
as
the
lady
inform
you
in
a
whisper
,
Mr
Sliverstone
always

.
 
<EOS>
no

,
and
there

Sliverstone
,
with
dishevelled
hair
,
powder
away
with
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
at
a
rate
which
,
if
he
have
any
power
of
sustain
it
,
would
settle
the
long
sermon
in
no
time
.
 
<EOS>
at
first
he
be
too
much
absorb
to
be
rouse
by
this
intrusion
;
but
presently
look
up
,
say
faintly
,
"
ah
!
"
and
point
to
his
desk
with
a
weary
and
languid
smile
,
extend
his
hand
,
and
hope
you
will
forgive
him
.
<EOS>
then
Mrs
Sliverstone
sit
down
beside
him
,
and
take
his
hand
in
her
,
tell
you
how
that
Mr
Sliverstone
have
be
shut
up
there
ever
since
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
(
it
be
by
this
time
twelve
at
noon
,
)
and
how
she
know
it
can
not
be
good
for
his
health
,
and
be
very
uneasy
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
unto
this
Mr
Sliverstone
reply
firmly
,
that
"
It
must
be
do
;
"
which
agonize
Mrs
Sliverstone
still
more
,
and
she
go
on
to
tell
you
that
such
be
Mr
Sliverstone
's
labour
last
week
---
what
with
the
burying
,
marrying
,
churching
,
christening
,
and
all
together
,
---
that
when
he
be
go
up
the
pulpit
stair
on
Sunday
evening
,
he
be
oblige
to
hold
on
by
the
rail
,
or
he
would
certainly
have
fall
over
into
his
own
pew
.
<EOS>
Mr
Sliverstone
,
who
have
be
listen
and
smile
meekly
,
say
,
"
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
,
not
quite
so
bad
!
"
<EOS>
he
admit
though
,
on
cross
-
examination
,
that
he
be
very
near
fall
upon
the
verger
who
be
follow
him
up
to
bolt
the
door
;
but
add
,
that
it
be
his
duty
as
a
Christian
to
fall
upon
him
,
if
need
be
,
and
that
he
,
Mr
Sliverstone
,
and
(
possibly
the
verger
too
)
ought
to
glory
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
this
sentiment
communicate
new
impulse
to
Mrs
Sliverstone
,
who
launch
into
new
praise
of
Mr
Sliverstone
's
worth
and
excellence
,
to
which
he
listen
in
the
same
meek
silence
,
save
when
he
put
in
a
word
of
self
-
denial
relative
to
some
question
of
fact
,
as
---
"
not
seventy
-
two
christening
that
week
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
only
seventy
-
one
,
only
seventy
-
one
.
"
 
<EOS>
at
length
his
lady
have
quite
conclude
,
and
then
he
say
,
why
should
he
repine
,
why
should
he
give
way
,
why
should
he
suffer
his
heart
to
sink
within
him
?
 
<EOS>
be
it
he
alone
who
toil
and
suffer
?
 
<EOS>
what
have
she
go
through
,
he
should
like
to
know
?
 
<EOS>
what
do
she
go
through
every
day
for
him
and
for
society
?
  
<EOS>
with
such
an
exordium
Mr
Sliverstone
launch
out
into
glow
praise
of
the
conduct
of
Mrs
Sliverstone
in
the
production
of
eight
young
child
,
and
the
subsequent
rear
and
fostering
of
the
same
;
and
thus
the
husband
magnify
the
wife
,
and
the
wife
the
husband
.
  
<EOS>
this
would
be
well
enough
if
Mr
and
Mrs
Sliverstone
keep
it
to
themselves
,
or
even
to
themselves
and
a
friend
or
two
;
but
they
do
not
.
 
<EOS>
the
more
hearer
they
have
,
the
more
egotistical
the
couple
become
,
and
the
more
anxious
they
be
to
make
believer
in
their
merit
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
this
be
the
bad
kind
of
egotism
.
 
<EOS>
It
have
not
even
the
poor
excuse
of
be
spontaneous
,
but
be
the
result
of
a
deliberate
system
and
malice
aforethought
.
 
<EOS>
mere
empty

head
conceit
excite
our
pity

ostentatious
hypocrisy
awaken

<EOS>
indeed

the

inquire
very
affectionately
after
Mr

but
by

never
leave
off

until

,
and
very
often
not

<EOS>
but
Mr

home
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
receive
by
Mrs

and
Mrs
Chopper
,
who
,
on
his
remarking
that
he
think
his
foot
be
damp
,
turn
pale
as
ashe
and
drag
him
up

stair
,
implore
him
to
have
them
rub
directly
with
a
dry
coarse
towel

<EOS>
rub
they
be

one
by

Mr

to
make
horrible

now

the
dinner

always
a
good
one
,
the
appetite
of
the
diner
be
delicate
,
and
require
a
little
of
what
Mrs
Merrywinkle
call
"
tittivation
;
"
the
secret
of
which
be
understand
to
lie
in
good
cookery
and
tasteful
spice
,
and
which
process
be
so
successfully
perform
in
the
present
instance
,
that
both
Mr
and
Mrs
Merrywinkle
eat
a
remarkably
good
dinner
,
and
even
the
afflict
Mrs
Chopper
wield
her
knife
and
fork
with
much
of
the
spirit
and
elasticity
of
youth
.
 
<EOS>
but
Mr
Merrywinkle
,
in
his
desire
to
gratify
his
appetite
,
be
not
unmindful
of
his
health
,
for
he
have
a
bottle
of
carbonate
of
soda
with
which
to
qualify
his
porter
,
and
a
little
pair
of
scale
in
which
to
weigh
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
neither
in
his
anxiety
to
take
care
of
his
body
be
he
unmindful
of
the
welfare
of
his
immortal
part
,
as
he
always
pray
that
for
what
he
be
go
to
receive
he
may
be
make
truly
thankful
;
and
in
order
that
he
may
be
as
thankful
as
possible
,
eat
and
drink
to
the
utmost
.
  
<EOS>
either
from
eat
and
drink
so
much
,
or
from
be
the
victim
of
this
constitutional
infirmity
,
among
other
,
Mr
Merrywinkle
,
after
two
or
three
glass
of
wine
,
fall
fast
asleep
;
and
he
have
scarcely
close
his
eye
,
when
Mrs
Merrywinkle
and
Mrs
Chopper
fall
asleep
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
on
awaken
at
tea
-
time
that
their
most
alarming
symptom
prevail
;
for
then
Mr
Merrywinkle
feel
as
if
his
temple
be
tightly
bind
round
with
the
chain
of
the
street

door
,
and
Mrs
Merrywinkle
as
if
she
have
make
a
hearty
dinner
of
half
-
hundredweight
,
and
Mrs
Chopper
as
if
cold
water
be
run
down
her
back
,
and
oyster

knife
with
sharp
point
be
plunge
of
their
own
accord
into
her
rib
.
 
<EOS>
symptom
like
these
be
enough
to
make
people
peevish
,
and
no
wonder
that
they
remain
so
until
supper
-
time
,
do
little
more
than
doze
and
complain
,
unless
Mr
Merrywinkle
call
out
very
loudly
to
a
servant
"
to
keep
that
draught
out
,
"
or
rush
into
the
passage
to
flourish
his
fist
in
the
countenance
of
the
twopenny

postman
,
for
dare
to
give
such
a
knock
as
he
have
just
perform
at
the
door
of
a
private
gentleman
with
nerve
.
  
<EOS>
supper
,
come
after
dinner
,
should
consist
of
some
gentle
provocative

tittivating
art

Mr

Mrs
Merrywinkle

have
administer
to
her
a
warm
cordial

which

Mr

superintend
the
mulling
of
some
wine
which
he
be
to
drink
at
the
very
moment
he
plunge

while
Mrs

take
four
small

something
hot

fragrant
out
of
another

<EOS>
there
be
another
kind
of
couple
who
coddle
themselves
,
and
who
do
so
at
a
cheap
rate
and
on
more
spare
diet
,
because
they
be
niggardly
and
parsimonious
;
for
which
reason
they
be
kind
enough
to
coddle
their
visitor
too
.

It
be
unnecessary
to
describe
them
,
for
our

may
rest
assure
of
the
accuracy
of
these
general
principle
:
---
that
all
couple
who
coddle
themselves
be
selfish
and
slothful
,
---
that
they
charge
upon
every
wind
that
blow
,
every
rain
that
fall
,
and
every
vapour
that
hang
in
the
air
,
the
evil
which
arise
from
their
own
imprudence
or
the
gloom
which
be
engender
in
their
own
temper
,
---
and
that
all
man
and
woman
,
in
couple
or
otherwise
,
who
fall
into
exclusive
habit
of
self
-
indulgence
,
and
forget
their
natural
sympathy
and
close
connexion
with
everybody
and
everything
in
the
world
around
them
,
not
only
neglect
the
first
duty
of
life
,
but
,
by
a
happy
retributive
justice
,
deprive
themselves
of
its
true
and
good
enjoyment

It

where

of
that
happy

upon
the
old

and
his

like

<EOS>
let
<EOS>
yonder
peevish
bachelor

rack
by
rheumatic

with
the

let

answer
to
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
He
recollect
something
of
a
favourite
playmate
;
her
name
be
Lucy
---
so
they
tell
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
sure
whether
she
be
married
,
or
go
abroad
,
or

<EOS>
It
be
a
long

and
he

<EOS>
be
nothing
as
it

do
no

feel
,
or

,
or
act
,
as

?
 
<EOS>
yes
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
an
aged
woman
who
once
live
servant
with
the
old
lady

and
be

<EOS>
She

in
their
sickness
those
who
be
no

<EOS>
Her
old
mistress
have
still
something
of
youth
in

the
young

be
like
what
she
be
but
not
quite
so
handsome
,
nor
be
the
gentleman
as
stately
as
Mr

<EOS>
She
have
see
a
great
deal
of

her

but
she

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
death
have
not
leave
her
alone
,
and
this
,
with
a
roof
above
her
head
,
and
a
warm
hearth
to
sit
by
,
make
her
cheerful
and
contented
.
 
<EOS>
do
she
remember
the
marriage
of
great

grandmamma
?
 
<EOS>
ay
,
that
she
do
,
as
well
---
as
if
it
be
only
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
not
think
it
to
look
at
her
now
,
and
perhaps
she
ought
not
to
say
so
of
herself
,
but
she
be
as
smart
a
young
girl
then
as
you
would
wish
to
see

<EOS>
She
recollect
she
take
a
friend
of
hers
up

stair
to
see
Miss
Emma
dress
for
church
;
her
name
be

ah

<EOS>
she
forget
the
name

but
she
remember
that
she
be
a
very
pretty
girl
,
and
that
she
marry
not
long
afterwards
,
and
live
---
<EOS>
it
have
quite
pass
out
of
her
mind
where
she
live

but
she
know
she
have
a
bad
husband
who
use
her
ill
,
and
that
she
die
in
Lambeth
work

house
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
,
in
Lambeth
workhouse
!
  
<EOS>
and
the
old
couple
---
have
they
no
comfort
or
enjoyment
of
existence
?
 
<EOS>
see
them
among
their
grandchild
and
great
-
grandchild
;
how
garrulous
they
be
,
how
they
compare
one
with
another
,
and
insist
on
likeness
which
no
one
else
can
see
;
how
gently
the
old
lady
lecture
the
girl
on
point
of
breeding
and
decorum
,
and
point
the
moral
by
anecdote
of
herself
in
her
young
day
---
how
the
old
gentleman
chuckle
over
boyish
feat
and
roguish
trick
,
and
tell
long
story
of
a
"
bar

which
be
very
wrong
,
he
tell
the
boy
,
and
never
to
be
imitate
of
course
,
but
which
he
can
not
help
let
them
know
be
very
pleasant
too
---
especially
when
he
kiss
the
master
's
niece
.
 
<EOS>
this
last
,
however
,
be
a
point
on
which
the
old
lady
be
very
tender
,
for
she
consider
it
a
shocking
and
indelicate
thing
to
talk
about
,
and
always
say
so
whenever
it
be
mention
,
never
fail
to
observe
that
he
ought
to
be
very
penitent
for
have
be
so
sinful

<EOS>
so
the
old

get
no
further

and
what
the
schoolmaster

niece
say
afterwards
(
which
he

(

a
young
fellow

very
subject
to
that
complaint

.
 
<EOS>
"
that

"
I

It

You

<EOS>
"
I

retort
the

<EOS>
"
He

he
do
not

<EOS>
He
always
would
go
a
running
about
the
street
---
walk
never
satisfy
his
spirit
---
and
he
run
against
a
post
and
die
of
a
hurt
in
his
chest
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
the
old
gentleman
say
no
more
until
the
shaving
be
conclude
,
and
then
he
give
Crofts
half
-
a

crown
to
drink
his
health
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
little
doubtful
of
the
barber
's
veracity
afterwards
,
and
tell
the
anecdote
to
the
old
lady
,
affect
to
make
very
light
of
it
---
though
to
be
sure
(
he
add
)
<EOS>
there
be
old
Parr
,
and
in
some
part
of
England
,
ninety
-
five
or
so
be
a
common
age
,
quite
a
common
age
.
  
<EOS>
this
morning
the
old
couple
be
cheerful
but
serious
,
recall
old
time
as
well
as
they
can
remember
them
,
and
dwell
upon
many
passage
in
their
past
life
which
the
day
bring
to
mind
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
lady
read
aloud
,
in
a
tremulous
voice
,
out
of
a
great
Bible
,
and
the
old
gentleman
with
his
hand
to
his
ear
,
listen
with
profound
respect
.
 
<EOS>
when
the
book
be
closed
,
they
sit
silent
for
a
short
space
,
and
afterwards
resume
their
conversation
,
with
a
reference
perhaps
to
their
dead
child
,
as
a
subject
not
unsuited
to
that
they
have
just
leave
.
 
<EOS>
by
degree
they
be
lead
to
consider
which
of
those
who
survive
be
the
most
like
those
dearly
-
remember
object
,
and
so
they
fall
into
a
less
solemn
strain
,
and
become
cheerful
again
.
  
<EOS>
how
many
people
in
all
,
grandchild
,
great
-
grandchild
,
and
one
or
two
intimate
friend
of
the
family
,
dine
together
to
-
day
at
the
eld
son
's
to
congratulate
the
old
couple
,
and
wish
them
many
happy
return
,
be
a
calculation
beyond
our
power
;
but
this
we
know
,
that
the
old
couple
no
sooner
present
themselves
,
very
sprucely
and
carefully
attire
,
than
there
be
a
violent
shouting
and
rush
forward
of
the
young
branch
with
all
manner
of
present
,
such
as
pocket

book

pencil

and
even
a

the
latter
article
be
present
by
a
very
chubby
and
very
little
boy
,
who
exhibit
it
in
great
triumph
as
an
extraordinary
variety
.
 
<EOS>
the
old
couple
's
emotion
at
these
token
of
remembrance
occasion
quite
a
pathetic
scene
,
of
which
the
chief
ingredient
be
a
vast
quantity
of
kissing
and
hugging
,
and
repeat
wiping
of
small
eye
and
nose
with
small
square
pocket
-
handkerchiefs
,
which
do
not
come
at
all
easily
out
of
small
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
even
the
peevish
bachelor
be
move
,
and
he
say
,
as
he
present
the
old
gentleman
with
a
queer
sort
of
antique
re
from
his
own
finger
,
that
he
will
be
de'e
if
he
do
not
think
he
look
young
than
he
do
ten
year
ago
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
great
time
be
after
dinner
,
when
the
dessert
and
wine
be
on
the
table
,
which
be
push
back
to
make
plenty
of
room
,
and
they
be
all
gather
in
a
large
circle
round
the
fire
,
for
it
be
then
---
the
glass
be
fill
,
and
everybody
ready
to
drink
the
toast
---
that
two
great

grandchild
rush
out
at
a
give
signal
,
and
presently
return
,
drag
in
old
Jane
Adams
lean
upon
her
crutched
stick
,
and
tremble
with
age
and
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
who
so
popular
as
poor
old
Jane
,
nurse
and
story
-
teller
in
ordinary
to
two
generation
;
and
who
so
happy
as
she
,
strive
to
bend
her
stiff
limb
into
a
curtsey
,
while
tear
of
pleasure
steal
down
her
withered
cheek
!
  
<EOS>
the
old
couple
sit
side
by
side
,
and
the
old
time
seem
like
yesterday
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
look
back
upon
the
path
they
have
travel
,
its
dust
and
ashe
disappear
;
the
flower
that
wither
long
ago
,
show
brightly
again
upon
its
border
,
and
they
grow
young
once
more
in
the
youth
of
those
about
them
.
    
<EOS>
Conclusion
    
<EOS>
We
have
take
for
the
subject
of
the
foregoing
moral
essay
,
twelve
sample
of
married
couple
,
carefully
select
from
a
large
stock
on
hand
,
open
to
the
inspection
of
all
comer
.
 
<EOS>
these
sample
be
intend
for
the
benefit
of
the
rise
generation
of
both
sex
,
and
,
for
their
more
easy
and
pleasant
information
,
have
be
separately
ticket
and
label
in
the
manner
they
have
see
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
purposely
exclude
from
consideration
the
couple
in
which
the
lady
reigns
paramount
and
supreme
,
hold
such
case
to
be
of
a
very
unnatural
kind
,
and
like
hideous
birth
and
other
monstrous
deformity
,
only

<EOS>
and
here
our
self
-
impose
task
would
have
end
,
but
that
to
those
young
lady
and
gentleman
who
be
yet
revolve
singly
round
the
church
,
await
the
advent
of
that
time
when
the
mysterious
law
of
attraction
shall
draw
them
towards
it
in
couple
<EOS>
,
we
be
desirous
of
address
a
few
last
word
.
  
<EOS>
before
marriage
and
afterwards
,
let
them
learn
to
centre
all
their
hope
of
real
and
lasting
happiness
in
their
own
fireside
;
let
them
cherish
the
faith
that
in
home
,
and
all
the
english
virtue
which
the
love
of
home
engender
,
lie
the
only
true
source
of
domestic
felicity
;
let
them
believe
that
round
the
household
god
,
contentment
and
tranquillity
cluster
in
their
gentle
and
most
graceful
form
;
and
that
many
weary
hunter
of
happiness
through
the
noisy
world
,
have
learn
this
truth
too
late
,
and
find
a
cheerful
spirit
and
a
quiet
mind
only
at
home
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
how
much
may
depend
on
the
education
of
daughter
and
the
conduct
of
mother
;
how
much
of
the
bright
part
of
our
old
national
character
may
be
perpetuate
by
their
wisdom
or
fritter
away
by
their
folly
---
how
much
of
it
may
have
be
lose
already
,
and
how
much
more
in
danger
of
vanish
every
day
---
be
question
too
weighty
for
discussion
here
,
but
well
deserve
a
little
serious
consideration
from
all
young
couple
nevertheless
.
  
<EOS>
to
that
one
young
couple
on
whose
bright
destiny
the
thought
of
nation
be
fix
,
may
the
youth
of
England
look
,
and
not
in
vain
,
for
an
example
.
 
<EOS>
from
that
one
young
couple
,
bless
and
favour
as
they
be
,
may
they
learn
that
even
the
glare
and
glitter
of
a
court
,
the
splendour
of
a
palace
,
and
the
pomp
and
glory
of
a
throne
,
yield
in
their
power
of
confer
happiness
,
to
domestic
worth
and
virtue
.
 
<EOS>
from
that
one
young
couple
may
they
learn
that
the
crown
of
a
great
empire
,
costly
and
jewel
though
it
be
,
give
place
in
the
estimation
of
a
Queen
to
the
plain
gold
ring
that
link
her
woman
's
nature
to
that
of
ten
of
thousand
of
her
humble
subject
,
and
guard
in
her
woman
's
heart
one
secret
store
of
tenderness
,
whose
proud
boast
shall
be
that
it
know
no
Royalty
save
Nature
's
own
,
and
no
pride
of
birth
but
be
the
child
of
heaven
!
  
<EOS>
so
shall
the
high
young
couple
in
the
land
for
once
hear
the
truth
,
when

throw
up

public
Life
of
Mr
Tulrumble
---
<EOS>
once
Mayor
of
Mudfog
    
Mudfog
be
a
pleasant
town
---
a
remarkably
pleasant
town
---
situate
in
a
charming
hollow
by
the
side
of
a
river
,
from
which
river
,
Mudfog
derive
an
agreeable
scent
of
pitch
,
tar
,
coal
,
and
rope
-
yarn
,
a
rove
population
in
oilskin
hat
,
a
pretty
steady
influx
of
drunken
bargeman
,
and
a
great
many
other
maritime
advantage
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
good
deal
of
water
about
Mudfog
,
and
yet
it
be
not
exactly
the
sort
of
town
for
a
watering
-
place
,
either
.
 
<EOS>
Water
be
a
perverse
sort
of
element
at
the
good
of
time
,
and
in
Mudfog
it
be
particularly
so
.
 
<EOS>
in
winter
,
it
come
ooze
down
the
street
and
tumble
over
the
field
,
---
<EOS>
nay
,
rush
into
the
very
cellar
and
kitchen
of
the
house
,
with
a
lavish
prodigality
that
may
well
be
dispense
with
;
but
in
the
hot
summer
weather
it
WILL
dry
up
,
and
turn
green
:
 
and
,
although
green
be
a
very
good
colour
in
its
way
,
especially
in
grass
,
still
it
certainly
be
not
become
to
water
;
and
it
can
not
be
deny
that
the
beauty
of
Mudfog
be
rather
impair
,
even
by
this
trifle
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
Mudfog
be
a
healthy
place
---
very
healthy
;
---
damp
,
perhaps
,
but
none
the
bad
for
that
.
<EOS>
It
be
quite
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
damp
be
unwholesome
:
 
plant
thrive
best
in
damp
situation
,
and
why
should
not
man
?
 
<EOS>
the
inhabitant
of
Mudfog
be
unanimous
in
assert
that
there
exist
not
a
fine
race
of
people
on
the
face
of
the
earth
;
here
we
have
an
indisputable
and
veracious
contradiction
of
the
vulgar
error
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
admit
Mudfog
to
be
damp
,
we
distinctly
state
that
it
be
salubrious
.
  
<EOS>
the
town
of
Mudfog
be
extremely
picturesque
.
 
<EOS>
Limehouse
and
Ratcliff
Highway
be
both
something
like
it
,
but
they
give
you
a
very
faint
idea
of
Mudfog
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
many
more
public
-
house
in
Mudfog
---
more
than
in
Ratcliff
Highway
and
Limehouse
put
together
.
 
<EOS>
the
public
building
,
too
,
be
very
impose
.
 
<EOS>
We
consider
the
town
-
hall
one
of
the
fine
specimen
of
shed
architecture
,
extant
:
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
combination
of
the
pig
-
sty
and
tea
-
garden
-
box
order
;
and
the
simplicity
of
its
design
be
of
surpass
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
the
idea
of
place
a
large
window
on
one
side
of
the
door
,
and
a
small
one
on
the
other
,
be
particularly
happy
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
fine
old
doric
beauty
,
too
,
about
the
padlock
and
scraper
,
which
be
strictly
in
keep
with
the
general
effect
.
  
<EOS>
in
this
room
do
the
mayor
and
corporation
of
Mudfog
assemble
together
in
solemn
council
for
the
public
weal
.
 
<EOS>
Seated
on
the
massive
wooden
bench
,
which
,
with
the
table
in
the
centre
,
form
the
only
furniture
of
the
whitewashed
apartment
,
the
sage
man
of
Mudfog
spend
hour
after
hour
in
grave
deliberation
.
 
<EOS>
here
they
settle
at
what
hour
of
the
night
the
public
-
house
shall
be
close
,
at
what
hour
of
the
morning
they
shall
be
permit
to
open
,
how
soon
it
shall
be
lawful
for
people
to
eat
their
dinner
on
church
-
day
,
and
other
great
political
question
;
and
sometimes
,
long
after
silence
have
fall
on
the
town
,
and
the
distant
light
from
the
shop
and
house
have
cease
to
twinkle
,
like
far
-
off
star
,
to
the
sight
of
the
boatman
on
the
river
,
the
illumination
in
the
two
unequal
-
sized
window
of
the
town
-
hall
,
warn
the
inhabitant
of
Mudfog
that
its
little
body
of
legislator
,
like
a
large
and
better
-
know
body
of
the
same
genus
,
a
great
deal
more
noisy
,
and
not
a
whit
more
profound
,
be
patriotically
doze
away
in
company
,
far
into
the
night
,
for
their
country
's
good
.
  
<EOS>
among
this
knot
of
sage
and
learn
man
,
no
one
be
so
eminently
distinguish
,
during
many
year
,
for
the
quiet
modesty
of
his
appearance
and
demeanour
,
as
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
the
well
-
know
coal
-
dealer
.
 
<EOS>
however
excite
the
subject
of
discussion
,
however
animate
the
tone
of
the
debate
,
or
however
warm
the
personality
exchange
,
<EOS>
(
and
even
in
Mudfog
we
get
personal
sometimes
,
)
<EOS>
Nicholas
Tulrumble
be
always
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
to
say
truth
,
Nicholas
,
be
an
industrious
man
,
and
always
up
betime
,
be
apt
to
fall
asleep
when
a
debate
begin
,
and
to
remain
asleep
till
it
be
over
,
when
he
would
wake
up
very
much
refresh
,
and
give
his
vote
with
the
great
complacency
.
 
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
that
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
know
that
everybody
there
have
make
up
his
mind
beforehand
,
consider
the
talking
as
just
a
long
botheration
about
nothing
at
all
;
and
to
the
present
hour
it
remain
a
question
,
whether
,
on
this
point
at
all
event
,
Nicholas
Tulrumble
be
not
pretty
near
right
.
  
<EOS>
Time
,
which
strew
a
man
's
head
with
silver
,
sometimes
fill
his
pocket
with
gold
.
 
<EOS>
as
he
gradually
perform
one
good
office
for
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
he
be
oblige
enough
,
not
to
omit
the
other
.
<EOS>
Nicholas
begin
life
in
a
wooden
tenement
of
four
foot
square
,
with
a
capital
of
two
and
ninepence
,
and
a
stock
in
trade
of
three
bushel
and
a
-
half
of
coal
,
exclusive
of
the
large
lump
which
hang
,
by
way
of
sign
-
board
,
outside
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
enlarge
the
shed
,
and
keep
a
truck
;
then
he
leave
the
shed
,
and
the
truck
too
,
and
start
a
donkey
and
a
Mrs
tulrumble
;
then
he
move
again
and
set
up
a
cart
;
the
cart
be
soon
afterwards
exchange
for
a
waggon
;
and
so
he
go
on
like
his
great
predecessor
Whittington
---
only
without
a
cat
for
a
partner
---
increase
in
wealth
and
fame
,
until
at
last
he
give
up
business
altogether
,
and
retire
with
Mrs
Tulrumble
and
family
to
Mudfog
Hall
,
which
he
have
himself
erect
,
on
something
which
he
attempt
to
delude
himself
into
the
belief
<EOS>
be
a
hill
,
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
from
the
town
of
Mudfog
.
  
<EOS>
about
this
time
,
it
begin
to
be
murmur
in
Mudfog
that
Nicholas
Tulrumble
be
grow
vain
and
haughty
;
that
prosperity
and
success
have
corrupt
the
simplicity
of
his
manner
,
and
taint
the
natural
goodness
of
his
heart
;
in
short
,
that
he
be
set
up
for
a
public
character
,
and
a
great
gentleman
,
and
affect
to
look
down
upon
his
old
companion
with
compassion
and
contempt
.
 
<EOS>
whether
these
report
be
at
the
time
well
-
found
,
or
not
,
certain
it
be
that
Mrs
Tulrumble
very
shortly
afterwards
start
a
four
-
wheel
chaise
,
drive
by
a
tall
postilion
in
a
yellow
cap
,
---
that
Mr
Tulrumble
junior
take
to
smoking
cigar
,
and
call
the
footman
a
"
feller
,
"
---
and
that
Mr
Tulrumble
from
that
time
forth
,
be
no
more
see
in
his
old
seat
in
the
chimney
-
corner
of
the
Lighterman
's
arm
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
this
look
bad
;
but
,
more
than
this
,
it
begin
to
be
observe
that
Mr
Nicholas
Tulrumble
attend
the
corporation
meeting
more
frequently
than
heretofore
;
and
he
no
longer
go
to
sleep
as
he
have
do
for
so
many
year
,
but
prop
his
eyelid
open
with
his
two
forefinger
;
that
he
read
the
newspaper
by
himself
at
home
;
and
that
he
be
in
the
habit
of
indulge
abroad
in
distant
and
mysterious
allusion
to
"
masse
of
people
,
"
and
"
the
property
of
the
country
,
"
and
"
productive
power
,
"
and
"
the
monied
interest
:
"
all
of
which
denote
and
prove
that
Nicholas
Tulrumble
be
either
mad
,
or
bad
;
and
it
puzzle
the
good
people
of
Mudfog
amazingly
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
,
about
the
middle
of
the
month
of
October
,
Mr
Tulrumble
and
family
go
up
to
London
;
the
middle
of
October
be
,
as
Mrs
Tulrumble
inform
her
acquaintance
in
Mudfog
,
the
very
height
of
the
fashionable
season
.
  
<EOS>
somehow
or
other
,
just
about
this
time
,
despite
the
health
-
preserve
air
of
Mudfog
,
the
Mayor
die
.
 
<EOS>
It
be
a
most
extraordinary
circumstance
;
he
have
live
in
Mudfog
for
eighty
-
five
year
.
 
<EOS>
the
corporation
do
not
understand
it
at
all
;
indeed
it
be
with
great
difficulty
that
one
old
gentleman
,
who
be
a
great
stickler
for
form
,
be
dissuade
from
propose
a
vote
of
censure
on
such
unaccountable
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
Strange
as
it
be
,
however
,
die
he
do
,
without
take
the
slight
notice
of
the
corporation
;
and
the
corporation
be
imperatively
call
upon
to
elect
his
successor
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
they
meet
for
the
purpose
;
and
be
very
full
of
Nicholas
Tulrumble
just
then
,
and
Nicholas
Tulrumble
be
a
very
important
man
<EOS>
,
they
elect
him
,
and
write
off
to
London
by
the
very
next
post
to
acquaint
Nicholas
Tulrumble
with
his
new
elevation
.
  
<EOS>
now
,
it
be
November
time
,
and
Mr
Nicholas
Tulrumble
be
in
the
capital
,
it
fall
out
that
he
be
present
at
the
Lord
Mayor
's
show
and
dinner
,
at
sight
of
the
glory
and
splendour
whereof
,
he
,
Mr
Tulrumble
,
be
greatly
mortify
,
inasmuch
as
the
reflection
would
force
itself
on
his
mind
,
that
,
have
he
be
bear
in
London
instead
of
in
Mudfog
<EOS>
,
he
may
have
be
a
Lord
Mayor
too
,
and
have
patronize
the
judge
,
and
be
affable
to
the
Lord
Chancellor
,
and
friendly
with
the
Premier
,
and
coldly
condescend
to
the
Secretary
to
the
Treasury
,
and
have
dine
with
a
flag
behind
his
back
,
and
do
a
great
many
other
act
and
deed
which
unto
Lord
Mayors
of
London
peculiarly
appertain
.
 
<EOS>
the
more
he
think
of
the
Lord
Mayor
,
the
more
enviable
a
personage
he
seem
.
 
<EOS>
to
be
a
king
be
all
very
well
;
but
what
be
the
King
to
the
Lord
Mayor
!
 
<EOS>
when
the
King
make
a
speech
,
everybody
know
it
be
somebody
else
's
writing
;
whereas
here
be
the
Lord
Mayor
,
talk
away
for
half
an
hour
-
all
out
of
his
own
head
---
amidst
the
enthusiastic
applause
of
the
whole
company
,
while
it
be
notorious
that
the
King
may
talk
to
his
parliament
till
he
be
black
in
the
face
without
get
so
much
as
a
single
cheer
.
 
<EOS>
as
all
these
reflection
pass
through
the
mind
of
Mr
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
the
Lord
Mayor
of
London
appear
to
him
the
great
sovereign
on
the
face
of
the
earth
,
beat
the
Emperor
of
Russia
all
to
nothing
,
and
leave
the
Great
Mogul
immeasurably
behind
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Nicholas
Tulrumble
be
ponder
over
these
thing
,
and
inwardly
curse
the
fate
which
have
pitch
his
coal
-
shed
in
Mudfog
,
when
the
letter
of
the
corporation
be
put
into
his
hand
.
<EOS>
a
crimson
flush
mantle
over
his
face
as
he
read
it
,
for
vision
of
brightness
be
already
dance
before
his
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear

"
say
Mr
Tulrumble
to
his
wife
,
"
they
have
elect
me
,
Mayor
of

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"

say
Mrs

:
 
<EOS>
"
why

?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
late
Mr
Sniggs

Mrs
Tulrumble

"
say
Mr
Tulrumble
sharply
,
for
he
by
no

approve
of
the
notion
of
unceremoniously
designate
a
gentleman
who
fill
the
high
office
of
Mayor
,
as
"
Old
Sniggs
,
"
---
"
the
late
Mr
Sniggs
,
Mrs
Tulrumble
,
be
dead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
communication
be
very
unexpected
;
but
Mrs
Tulrumble
only
ejaculate
"
Lor
-
a
-
mussy
!
"
<EOS>
once
again
,
as
if
a
Mayor
be
a
mere
ordinary
Christian
,
at
which
Mr
Tulrumble
frown
gloomily
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
a
pity
"
tan't
in
London
,
be
not
it
?
"
say
Mrs
Tulrumble
,
after
a
short
pause
;
"
what
a
pity
"
tan't
in
London
,
where
you
may
have
have
a
show
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
have
a
show
in
Mudfog
,
if
I
think
proper
,
I
apprehend
,
"
say
Mr
Tulrumble
mysteriously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lor
!
<EOS>
so
you
may
,
I
declare
,
"
reply
Mrs
Tulrumble
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
a
good
one
too
,
"
say
Mr
Tulrumble
.
  
<EOS>
"
delightful
!
"
exclaim
Mrs
Tulrumble
.
  
<EOS>
"
one
which
would
rather
astonish
the
ignorant
people
down
there
,
"
say
Mr
Tulrumble
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
kill
them
with
envy
,
"
say
Mrs
Tulrumble
.
  
<EOS>
so
it
be
agree
that
his
Majesty
's
liege
in
Mudfog
should
be
astonish
with
splendour
,
and
slaughter
with
envy
,
and
that
such
a
show
should
take
place
as
have
never
be
see
in
that
town
,
or
in
any
other
town
before
,
---
no
,
not
even
in
London
itself
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
very
next
day
after
the
receipt
of
the
letter
,
down
come
the
tall
postilion
in
a
post
-
chaise
,
---
not
upon
one
of
the
horse
,
but
inside
---
actually
inside
the
chaise
,
---
and
,
drive
up
to
the
very
door
of
the
town
-
hall
,
where
the
corporation
be
assemble
,
deliver
a
letter
,
write
by
the
Lord

,
and
sign
by
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
in
which

Bath

that
he

to
the
call
of
his

townsman
with
feeling
of
heartfelt
delight
;
that
he
accept
the
arduous
office
which
their
confidence
have
impose
upon
him
;
that
they
would
never
find
him
shrink
from
the
discharge
of
his
duty
;
that
he
would
endeavour
to
execute
his
function
with
all
that
dignity
which
their
magnitude
and
importance
demand
;
and
a
great
deal
more
to
the
same
effect
.
 
<EOS>
but
even
this
be
not
all
.
 
<EOS>
the
tall
postilion
produce
from
his
right
-
hand
top
-
boot
,
a
damp
copy
of
that
afternoon
's
number
of
the
county
paper
;
and
there
,
in
large
type
,
run
the
whole
length
of
the
very
first
column
,
be
a
long
address
from
Nicholas
Tulrumble
to
the
inhabitant
of
Mudfog
,
in
which
he
say
that
he
cheerfully
comply
with
their
requisition
,
and
,
in
short
,
as
if
to
prevent
any
mistake
about
the
matter
,
tell
them
over
again
what
a
grand
fellow
he
mean
to
be
,
in
very
much
the
same
term
as
those
in
which
he
have
already
tell
them
all
about
the
matter
in
his
letter
.
  
<EOS>
the
corporation
stare
at
one
another
very
hard
at
all
this
,
and
then
look
as
if
for
explanation
to
the
tall
postilion
,
but
as
the
tall
postilion
be
intently
contemplate
the
gold
tassel
on
the
top
of
his
yellow
cap
,
and
could
have
afford
no
explanation
whatever
,
even
if
his
thought
have
be
entirely
disengage
,
they
content
themselves
with
cough
very
dubiously
,
and
look
very
grave
.
 
<EOS>
the
tall
postilion
then
deliver
another
letter
,
in
which
Nicholas
Tulrumble
inform
the
corporation
,
that
he
intend
repair
to
the
town
-
hall
,
in
grand
state
and
gorgeous
procession
,
on
the
Monday
afternoon
next
ensuing
.
 
<EOS>
at
this
the
corporation
look
still
more
solemn
;
but
,
as
the
epistle
wind
up
with
a
formal
invitation
to
the
whole
body
to
dine
with
the
Mayor
on
that
day
,
at
Mudfog
Hall
,
Mudfog
Hill
,
Mudfog
,
they
begin
to
see
the
fun
of
the
thing
directly
,
and
send
back
their
compliment
,
and
they
would
be
sure
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
now
there
happen
to
be
in
Mudfog
,
as
somehow
or
other
<EOS>
there
do
happen
to
be
,
in
almost
every
town
in
the
british
dominion
,
and
perhaps
in
foreign
dominion
too
---
we
think
it
very
likely
,
but
,
be
no
great
traveller
<EOS>
,
can
not
distinctly
say
---
there
happen
to
be
,
in
Mudfog
,
a
merry

temper
,
pleasant
-
faced
,
good
-
for
-
nothing
sort
of
vagabond
,
with
an
invincible
dislike
to
manual
labour
,
and
an
unconquerable
attachment
to
strong
beer
and
spirit
,
whom
everybody
know
,
and
nobody
,
except
his
wife
,
take
the
trouble
to
quarrel
with
,
who
inherit
from
his
ancestor
the
appellation
of
Edward
Twigger
,
and
rejoice
in
the
SOBRIQUET
of
Bottle
-
nosed
Ned
.
<EOS>
He
be
drunk
upon
the
average
once
a
day
,
and
penitent
upon
an
equally
fair
calculation
once
a
month
;
and
when
he
be
penitent
,
he
be
invariably
in
the
very
last
stage
of
maudlin
intoxication
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
a
ragged
,
rove
,
roar
kind
of
fellow
,
with
a
burly
form
,
a
sharp
wit
,
and
a
ready
head
,
and
could
turn
his
hand
to
anything
when
he
choose
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
by
no
means
oppose
to
hard
labour
on
principle
,
for
he
would
work
away
at
a
cricket
-
match
by
the
day
together
,
---
run
,
and
catching
,
and
batting
,
and
bowling
,
and
revelling
in
toil
which
would
exhaust
a
galley
-
slave
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
be
invaluable
to
a
fire
-
office
;
never
be
a
man
with
such
a
natural
taste
for
pump
engine
,
run
up
ladder
,
and
throw
furniture
out
of
two
-
pair
-
of
-
stair
'
window
:
 
nor
be
this
the
only
element
in
which
he
be
at
home
;
he
be
a
humane
society
in
himself
,
a
portable
drag
,
an
animate
life
-
preserver
,
and
have
save
more
people
,
in
his
time
,
from
drown
,
than
the
Plymouth

-
boat
,
or
Captain
Manby

apparatus
.
 
<EOS>
with
all
these
qualification
,
notwithstanding
his

,
Bottle

nosed
Ned

a
general
favourite
;
and
the
authority
of
Mudfog
,
remember
his
numerous
service
to
the
population
,
allow
him
in
return
to
get
drunk
in
his
own
way
,
without
the
fear
of
stock
,
fine
,
or
imprisonment

<EOS>
He
have
a
general
licence

and
he
show
his
sense
of
the

the
most

We

<EOS>
there
be
a
time
when
Twigger
would
have
reply

<EOS>
but
that
be
in
the

stout

with

He
make
a
trial

Nicholas
Tulrumble

satisfied

although

have
we

we

They

the

strike

<EOS>
a
cracked
trumpet
from
the
front
garden
of
Mudfog
Hall
produce
a
feeble
flourish
,
as
if
some
asthmatic
person
have
cough
into
it
accidentally
;
the
gate
fly
open
,
and
out
come
a
gentleman
,
on
a
moist
-
sugar
coloured
charger
,
intend
to
represent
a
herald
,
but
bear
a
much
strong
resemblance
to
a
court
-
card
on
horseback
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
one
of
the
Circus
people
,
who
always
come
down
to
Mudfog
at
that
time
of
the
year
,
and
who
have
be
engage
by
Nicholas
Tulrumble
expressly
for
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
the
horse
,
whisk
his
tail
about
,
balance
himself
on
his
hind
-
leg
,
and
flourish
away
with
his
fore
-
foot
,
in
a
manner
which
would
have
go
to
the
heart
and
soul
of
any
reasonable
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
but
a
Mudfog
crowd
never
be
a
reasonable
one
,
and
in
all
probability
never
will
be
.
 
<EOS>
instead
of
scatter
the
very
fog
with
their
shout
,
as
they
ought
most
indubitably
to
have
do
,
and
be
fully
intend
to
do
,
by
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
they
no
sooner
recognize
the
herald
,
than
they
begin
to
growl
forth
the
most
unqualified
disapprobation
at
the
bare
notion
of
his
riding
like
any
other
man
.
 
<EOS>
if
he
have
come
out
on
his
head
indeed
,
or
jump
through
a
hoop
,
or
fly
through
a
red
-
hot
drum
,
or
even
stand
on
one
leg
with
his
other
foot
in
his
mouth
,
they
may
have
have
something
to
say
to
him
;
but
for
a
professional
gentleman
to
sit
astride
in
the
saddle
,
with
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
,
be
rather
too
good
a
joke
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
the
herald
be
a
decide
failure
,
and
the
crowd
hoot
with
great
energy
,
as
he
prance
ingloriously
away
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
procession
come
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
afraid
to
say
how
many
supernumerary
there
be
,
in
striped
shirt
and
black
velvet
cap
,
to
imitate
the
London
waterman
,
or
how
many
base
imitation
of
running
-
footman
,
or
how
many
banner
,
<EOS>
which
,
owe
to
the
heaviness
of
the
atmosphere
,
could
by
no
means
be
prevail
on
to
display
their
inscription
:
 
still
less
do
we
feel
disposed
to
relate
how
the
man
who
play
the
wind
instrument
,
look
up
into
the
sky
(
we
mean
the
fog
)
with
musical
fervour
,
walk
through
pool
of
water
and
hillock
of
mud
,
till
they
cover
the
powder
head
of
the
running
-
footman
aforesaid
with
splash
,
that
look
curious
,
but
not
ornamental
;
or
how
the
barrel
-
organ
performer
put
on
the
wrong
stop
,
and
play
one
tune
while
the
band
play
another
;
or
how
the
horse
,
be
use
to
the
arena
,
and
not
to
the
street
,
would
stand
still
and
dance
,
instead
of
go
on
and
prance
;
---
all
of
which
be
matter
which
may
be
dilate
upon
to
great
advantage
,
but
which
we
have
not
the
least
intention
of
dilate
upon
,
notwithstanding
.
  
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
it
be
a
grand
and
beautiful
sight
to
behold
a
corporation
in
glass
coach
,
provide
at
the
sole
cost
and
charge
of
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
come
roll
along
,
like
a
funeral
out
of
mourning
,
and
to
watch
the
attempt
the
corporation
make
to
look
great
and
solemn
,
when
Nicholas
Tulrumble
himself
,
in
the
four
-
wheel
chaise
,
with
the
tall
postilion
,
roll
out
after
them
,
with
Mr
Jennings
on
one
side
to
look
like
a
chaplain
,
and
a
supernumerary
on
the
other
,
with
an
old
life
-
guardsman
's
sabre
,
to
imitate
the
sword
-
bearer
;
and
to
see
the
tear
roll
down
the
face
of
the
mob
as
they
scream
with
merriment
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
beautiful
!
<EOS>
and
so
be
the
appearance
of
Mrs
Tulrumble
and
son
,
as
they
bow
with
grave
dignity
out
of
their
coach
-
window
to
all
the
dirty
face
that
be
laugh
around
them
:
 
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
even
with
this
that
we
have
to
do
,
<EOS>
but
with
the
sudden
stopping
of
the
procession
at
another
blast
of
the
trumpet
,
whereat
,
and
whereupon
,
a
profound
silence
ensue
,
and
all
eye
be
turn
towards
Mudfog
Hall
,
in
the
confident
anticipation
of
some
new
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
will
not
laugh
now
,
Mr
Jennings
,
"
say
Nicholas
Tulrumble
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
sir
,
"

Mr

.
  
<EOS>
"
see
how
eager
they
look
,
"

Nicholas

<EOS>
"
aha
!
<EOS>
the
laugh
will
be
on
our
side
now
;
eh
,
Mr
Jennings
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
no
doubt
of
that
,
sir

"
reply
Mr
Jennings
;
and
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
in
a
state
of
pleasurable
excitement
,
stand
up
in
the
four
-
wheel
chaise
,
and
telegraph
gratification
to
the
Mayoress
behind
.
  
<EOS>
while
all
this
be
go
forward
,
Ned
Twigger
have
descend
into
the
kitchen
of
Mudfog
Hall
for
the
purpose
of
indulge
the
servant
with
a
private
view
of
the
curiosity
that
be
to
burst
upon
the
town
;
and
,
somehow
or
other
,
the
footman
be
so
companionable
,
and
the
housemaid
so
kind
,
and
the
cook
so
friendly
,
that
he
could
not
resist
the
offer
of
the
first
-
mention
to
sit
down
and
take
something
---
just
to
drink
success
to
master
in
.
  
<EOS>
so
,
down
Ned
Twigger
sit
himself
in
his
brass
livery
on
the
top
of
the
kitchen
-
table
;
and
in
a
mug
of
something
strong
,
pay
for
by
the
unconscious
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
and
provide
by
the
companionable
footman
,
drink
success
to
the
Mayor
and
his
procession
;
and
,
as
Ned
lay
by
his
helmet
to
imbibe
the
something
strong
,
the
companionable
footman
put
it
on
his
own
head
,
to
the
immeasurable
and
unrecordable
delight
of
the
cook
and
housemaid
.
<EOS>
the
companionable
footman
be
very
facetious
to
Ned
,
and
Ned
be
very
gallant
to
the
cook
and
housemaid
by
turn
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
all
very
cosy
and
comfortable
;
and
the
something
strong
go
briskly
round
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
Ned
Twigger
be
loudly
call
for
,
by
the
procession
people
:
 
and
,
have
have
his
helmet
fix
on
,
in
a
very
complicated
manner
,
by
the
companionable
footman
,
and
the
kind
housemaid
,
and
the
friendly
cook
,
he
walk
gravely
forth
,
and
appear
before
the
multitude
.
  
<EOS>
the
crowd
roar
---
it
be
not
with
wonder
,
it
be
not
with
surprise
;
it
be
most
decidedly
and
unquestionably
with
laughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
"
say
Mr
Tulrumble
,
start
up
in
the
four
-
wheel
chaise
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
laugh
?
 
<EOS>
if
they
laugh
at
a
man
in
real
brass
armour
,
they
would
laugh
when
their
own
father
be
die
.
 
<EOS>
why
do
not
he
go
into
his
place
,
Mr
Jennings
?
 
<EOS>
what
be
he
roll
down
towards
us
for
?
<EOS>
he
have
no
business
here
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
,
sir
---
"
falter
Mr
Jennings
.
  
<EOS>
"
Afraid
of
what
,
sir
?
"
say
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
look
up
into
the
secretary
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
afraid
he
be
drunk
,
sir
,
"
reply
Mr
Jennings
.
  
<EOS>
Nicholas
Tulrumble
take
one
look
at
the
extraordinary
figure
that
be
bear
down
upon
them
;
and
then
,
clasp
his
secretary
by
the
arm
,
utter
an
audible
groan
in
anguish
of
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
melancholy
fact
that
Mr
Twigger
have
full
licence
to
demand
a
single
glass
of
rum
on
the
putting
on
of
every
piece
of
the
armour
,
get
,
by
some
mean
or
other
,
rather
out
of
his
calculation
in
the
hurry
and
confusion
of
preparation
,
and
drink
about
four
glass
to
a
piece
instead
of
one
,
not
to
mention
the
something
strong
which
go
on
the
top
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
whether
the
brass
armour
check
the
natural
flow
of
perspiration
,
and
thus
prevent
the
spirit
from
evaporate
,
we
be
not
scientific
enough
to
know
;
but
,
whatever
the
cause
be
,
Mr
Twigger
no
sooner
find
himself
outside
the
gate
of
Mudfog
Hall
,
than
he
also
find
himself
in
a
very
considerable
state
of
intoxication
;
and
hence
his
extraordinary
style
of
progress
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
bad
enough
,
but
,
as
if
fate
and
fortune
have
conspire
against
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
Mr
Twigger
,
not
have
be
penitent
for
a
good
calendar
month
,
take
it
into
his
head
to
be
most
especially
and
particularly
sentimental
,
just
when
his
repentance
could
have
be
most
conveniently
dispensed
with
.
 
<EOS>
immense
tear
be
roll
down
his
cheek
,
and
he
be
vainly
endeavour
to
conceal
his
grief
by
apply
to
his
eye
a
blue
cotton
pocket
-
handkerchief
with
white
spot
,
---
an
article
not
strictly
in
keep
with
a
suit
of
armour
some
three
hundred
year
old
,
or
thereabout
.
  
<EOS>
"
Twigger
,
you
villain
!
"
say
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
quite
forget
his
dignity
,
"
go
back

<EOS>
"
  
"
never

Ned

<EOS>
"
I
be
a
miserable
wretch

<EOS>
I
will
never

you

"
  
<EOS>
the

receive
this
declaration
with
acclamation
of
"
that
be
right
,
Ned

do
not
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
intend
it
,
"

Ned
,
with
all
the
obstinacy
of
a
very
tipsy
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
unhappy

<EOS>
I

I

very
faithful

sir

<EOS>
I

never

"
 
<EOS>
have
reiterate
this
oblige
promise
,
Ned
proceed
in
broken
word
to
harangue
the
crowd
upon
the
number
of
year
he
have
live
in
Mudfog
,
the
excessive
respectability
of
his
character
,
and
other
topic
of
the
like
nature

<EOS>
"
here
!
will
anybody
lead
him
away
?
"
say
Nicholas
:
 
<EOS>
"
if
they
will
call
on
me
afterwards
,
I
will
reward
them
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
two
or
three
man
step
forward
,
with
the
view
of
bear
Ned
off
,
when
the
secretary
interpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
take
care
!
<EOS>
take
care
!
"
say
Mr
Jennings
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
;
but
they
would
better
not
go
too
near
him
,
because
,
if
he
fall
over
,
he
will
certainly
crush
somebody
.
"
  
<EOS>
at
this
hint
the
crowd
retire
on
all
side
to
a
very
respectful
distance
,
and
leave
Ned
,
like
the
Duke
of
Devonshire
,
in
a
little
circle
of
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
but
,
Mr
Jennings
,
"
say
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
"
he
will
be
suffocate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
very
sorry
for
it
,
sir
,
"
reply
Mr
Jennings
;
"
but
nobody
can
get
that
armour
off
,
without
his
own
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
quite
certain
of
it
from
the
way
he
put
it
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
here
Ned
weep
dolefully
,
and
shake
his
helmeted
head
,
in
a
manner
that
may
have
touch
a
heart
of
stone
;
but
the
crowd
have
not
heart
of
stone
,
and
they
laugh
heartily
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
me
,
Mr
Jennings
,
"
say
Nicholas
,
turn
pale
at
the
possibility
of
Ned
's
be
smother
in
his
antique
costume

<EOS>
"
dear
me
,
Mr
Jennings
,
can
nothing
be
do
with
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
nothing

"
reply
Ned
,
"
nothing
at
all

<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
I
be
an
unhappy
wretch
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
body
,
gentleman
,
in
a
brass
coffin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
at
this
poetical
idea
of
his
own
conjuring
up
,
Ned
cry
so
much
that
the
people
begin
to
get
sympathetic
,
and
to
ask
what
Nicholas
Tulrumble
mean
by
put
a
man
into
such
a
machine
as
that
;
and
one
individual
in
a
hairy
waistcoat
like
the
top
of
a
trunk
,
who
have
previously
express
his
opinion
that
if
Ned
have
not
be
a
poor
man
,
Nicholas
would
not
have
dare
do
it
,
hint
at
the
propriety
of
break
the
four
-
wheel
chaise
,
or
Nicholas
's
head
,
or
both
,
which
last
compound
proposition
the
crowd
seem
to
consider
a
very
good
notion
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
act
upon
,
however
,
for
it
have
hardly
be
broach
,
when
Ned
Twigger
's
wife
make
her
appearance
abruptly
in
the
little
circle
before
notice
,
and
Ned
no
sooner
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
face
and
form
,
than
from
the
mere
force
of
habit
he
set
off
towards
his
home
just
as
fast
as
his
leg
could
carry
him
;
and
that
be
not
very
quick
in
the
present
instance
either
,
for
,
however
ready
they
may
have
be
to
carry
him
,
they
could
not
get
on
very
well
under
the
brass
armour
.
 
<EOS>
so
,
Mrs
Twigger
have
plenty
of
time
to
denounce
Nicholas
Tulrumble
to
his
face
:
 
to
express
her
opinion
that
he
be
a
decide
monster
;
and
to
intimate
that
,
if
her
ill
-
use
husband
sustain
any
personal
damage
from
the
brass
armour
,
she
would
have
the
law
of
Nicholas
Tulrumble
for
manslaughter
.
 
<EOS>
when
she
have
say
all
this
with
due
vehemence
,
she
post
after
Ned
,
who
be
drag
himself
along
as
best
he
could
,
and
deplore
his
unhappiness
in
most
dismal
tone
.
  
<EOS>
what
a
wail
and
scream
Ned
's
child
raise
when
he
get
home
at
last
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Twigger
try
to
undo
the
armour
,
first
in
one
place
,
and
then
in
another
,
but
she
could
not
manage
it
;
so
she
tumble
Ned
into
bed
,
helmet
,
armour
,
gauntlet
,
and
all
.
 
<EOS>
such
a
creaking
as
the
bedstead
make
,
under
Ned
's
weight
in
his
new
suit
!
<EOS>
It
do
not
break
down
though
;
and
there
Ned
lie
,
like
the
anonymous
vessel
in
the
Bay
of
Biscay
,
till
next
day
,
drink
barley
-
water
,
and
look
miserable
:
 
and
every
time
he
groan
,
his
good
lady
say
it
serve
him
right
,
which
be
all
the
consolation
Ned
Twigger
get
.
  
<EOS>
Nicholas
Tulrumble
and
the
gorgeous
procession
go
on
together
to
the
town
-
hall
,
amid
the
hiss
and
groan
of
all
the
spectator
,
who
have
suddenly
take
it
into
their
head
to
consider
poor
Ned
a
martyr
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
be
formally
instal
in
his
new
office
,
in
acknowledgment
of
which
ceremony
he
deliver
himself
of
a
speech
,
compose
by
the
secretary
,
which
be
very
long
,
and
no
doubt
very
good
,
<EOS>
only
the
noise
of
the
people
outside
prevent
anybody
from
hear
it
,
but
Nicholas
Tulrumble
himself
.
 
<EOS>
after
which
,
the
procession
get
back
to
Mudfog
Hall
<EOS>
any
how
it
could
;
and
Nicholas
and
the
corporation
sit
down
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
dinner
be
flat
,
and
Nicholas
be
disappoint
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
such
dull
sleepy
old
fellow
,
that
corporation
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
make
quite
as
long
speech
as
the
Lord
Mayor
of
London
have
do
,
nay
,
he
say
the
very
same
thing
that
the
Lord
Mayor
of
London
have
say
,
and
the
deuce
a
cheer
the
corporation
give
him
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
only
one
man
in
the
party
who
be
thoroughly
awake
;
and
he
be
insolent
,
and
call
him
Nick
.
 
<EOS>
Nick
!
 
<EOS>
what
would
be
the
consequence
,
think
Nicholas
,
of
anybody
presume
to
call
the
Lord
Mayor
of
London
"
Nick
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
should
like
to
know
what
the
sword
-
bearer
would
say
to
that
;
or
the
recorder
,
or
the
toast
-
master
,
or
any
other
of
the
great
officer
of
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
nick
him
.
  
<EOS>
but
these
be
not
the
bad
of
Nicholas
Tulrumble
's
doing
.
 
<EOS>
if
they
have
be
,
he
may
have
remain
a
Mayor
to
this
day
,
and
have
talk
till
he
lose
his
voice
.
 
<EOS>
He
contract
a
relish
for
statistic
,
and
get
philosophical
;
and
the
statistic
and
the
philosophy
together
,
lead
him
into
an
act
which
increase
his
unpopularity
and
hasten
his
downfall
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
very
end
of
the
Mudfog
High
-
street
,
and
abut
on
the
river
-
side
,
stand
the
Jolly
Boatmen
,
an
old
-
fashioned
low
-
roofed
,
bay
-
windowe
house
,
with
a
bar
,
kitchen
,
and
tap
-
room
all
in
one
,
and
a
large
fireplace
with
a
kettle
to
correspond
,
round
which
<EOS>
the
work
man
have
congregate
time
out
of
mind
on
a
winter
's
night
,
refresh
by
draught
of
good
strong
beer
,
and
cheer
by
the
sound
of
a
fiddle
and
tambourine
:
 
the
Jolly
Boatmen
have
be
duly
license
by
the
Mayor
and
corporation
,
to
scrape
the
fiddle
and
thumb
the
tambourine
from
time
,
whereof
the
memory
of
the
old
inhabitant
goeth
not
to
the
contrary
.
 
<EOS>
now
Nicholas
Tulrumble
have
be
read
pamphlet
on
crime
,
and
parliamentary
report
,
---
or
have
make
the
secretary
read
them
to
him
,
which
be
the
same
thing
in
effect
,
---
and
he
at
once
perceive
that
this
fiddle
and
tambourine
must
have
do
more
to
demoralize
Mudfog
,
than
any
other
operating
cause
that
ingenuity
could
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
so
he
read
up
for
the
subject
,
and
determine
to
come
out
on
the
corporation
with
a
burst
,
the
very
next
time
the
licence
be
apply
for
.
  
<EOS>
the
licensing
day
come
,
and
the
red
-
faced
landlord
of
the
Jolly
Boatmen
walk
into
the
town
-
hall
,
look
as
jolly
as
need
be
,
have
actually
put
on
an
extra
fiddle
for
that
night
,
to
commemorate
the
anniversary
of
the
Jolly
Boatmen
's
music
licence
.
<EOS>
It
be
apply
for
in
due
form
,
and
be
just
about
to
be
grant
as
a
matter
of
course
,
when
up
rise
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
and
drown
the
astonished
corporation
in
a
torrent
of
eloquence
.
 
<EOS>
He
descant
in
glow
term
upon
the
increase
depravity
of
his
native
town
of
Mudfog
,
and
the
excess
commit
by
its
population
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
he
relate
how
shocked
he
have
be
,
to
see
barrel
of
beer
slide
down
into
the
cellar
of
the
Jolly
Boatmen
week
after
week
;
and
how
he
have
sit
at
a
window
opposite
the
Jolly
Boatmen
for
two
day
together
,
to
count
the
people
who
go
in
for
beer
between
the
hour
of
twelve
and
one
o'clock
alone
---
which
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
be
the
time
at
which
the
great
majority
of
the
Mudfog
people
dine
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
he
go
on
to
state
,
how
the
number
of
people
who
come
out
with
beer
-
jug
,
average
twenty
-
one
in
five
minute
,
which
,
be
multiply
by
twelve
,
give
two
hundred
and
fifty
-
two
people
with
beer
-
jug
in
an
hour
,
and
multiply
again
by
fifteen
<EOS>
(
the
number
of
hour
during
which
the
house
be
open
daily
)
yield
three
thousand
seven
hundred
and
eighty
people
with
beer
-
jug
per
day
,
or
twenty
-
six
thousand
four
hundred
and
sixty
people
with
beer
-
jug
,
per
week
.
 
<EOS>
then
he
proceed
to
show
that
a
tambourine
and
moral
degradation
be
synonymous
term
,
and
a
fiddle
and
vicious
propensity
wholly
inseparable
.
 
<EOS>
all
these
argument
he
strengthen
and
demonstrate
by
frequent
reference
to
a
large
book
with
a
blue
cover
,
and
sundry
quotation
from
the
Middlesex
magistrate
;
and
in
the
end
,
the
corporation
,
who
be
pose
with
the
figure
,
and
sleepy
with
the
speech
,
and
sadly
in
want
of
dinner
into
the
bargain
,
yield
the
palm
to
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
and
refuse
the
music
licence
to
the
Jolly
Boatmen
.
  
<EOS>
but
although
Nicholas
triumph
,
his
triumph
be
short
.
 
<EOS>
He
carry
on
the
war
against
beer
-
jug
and
fiddle
,
forget
the
time
when
he
be
glad
to
drink
out
of
the
one
,
and
to
dance
to
the
other
,
till
the
people
hate
,
and
his
old
friend
shun
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
grow
tired
of
the
lonely
magnificence
of
Mudfog
Hall
,
and
his
heart
yearn
towards
the
Lighterman
's
arm
.
 
<EOS>
He
wish
he
have
never
set
up
as
a
public
man
,
and
sigh
for
the
good
old
time
of
the
coal
-
shop
,
and
the
chimney
corner
.
  
<EOS>
at
length
old
Nicholas
,
be
thoroughly
miserable
,
take
heart
of
grace
,
pay
the
secretary
a
quarter
's
wage
in
advance
,
and
pack
him
off
to
London
by
the
next
coach
.
 
<EOS>
have
take
this
step
,
he
put
his
hat
on
his
head
,
and
his
pride
in
his
pocket
,
and
walk
down
to
the
old
room
at
the
Lighterman
's
arm
.
 
<EOS>
there
be
only
two
of
the
old
fellow
there
,
and
they
look
coldly
on
Nicholas
as
he
proffer
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
go
to
put
down
pipe
,
Mr
Tulrumble
?
"
say
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
or
trace
the
progress
of
crime
to

"
growl
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
neither
,
"
reply
Nicholas
Tulrumble
,
shake
hand
with
them
both
,
whether
they
would
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
down
to
say
that
I
be
very
sorry
for
have
make
a
fool
of
myself
,
and
that
I
hope
you
will
give
me
up
the
old
chair
,
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
the
old
fellow
open
their
eye
,
and
three
or
four
more
old
fellow
open
the
door
,
to
whom
Nicholas
,
with
tear
in
his
eye
,
thrust
out
his
hand
too
,
and
tell
the
same
story
.
 
<EOS>
They
raise
a
shout
of
joy
,
that
make
the
bell
in
the
ancient
church
-
tower
vibrate
again
,
and
wheel
the
old
chair
into
the
warm
corner
,
thrust
old
Nicholas
down
into
it
,
and
order
in
the
very
large
-
sized
bowl
of
hot
punch
,
with
an
unlimited
number
of
pipe
,
directly
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
,
the
Jolly
Boatmen
get
the
licence
,
and
the
next
night
,
old
Nicholas
and
Ned
Twigger
's
wife
lead
off
a
dance
to
the
music
of
the
fiddle
and
tambourine
,
the
tone
of
which
seem
mightily
improve
by
a
little
rest
,
for
they
never
have
play
so
merrily
before
.
 
<EOS>
Ned
Twigger
be
in
the
very
height
of
his
glory
,
and
he
dance
hornpipe
,
and
balance
chair
on
his
chin
,
and
straw
on
his
nose
,
till
the
whole
company
,
include
the
corporation
,
be
in
rapture
of
admiration
at
the
brilliancy
of
his
acquirement
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Tulrumble
,
junior
,
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
be
anything
but
magnificent
,
so
he
go
up
to
London
and
draw
bill
on
his
father
;
and
when
he
have
overdrawn
,
and
get
into
debt
,
he
grow
penitent
,
and
come
home
again
.
  
<EOS>
as
to
old
Nicholas
,
he
keep
his
word
,
and
have
have
six
week
of
public
life
,
never
try
it
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
go
to
sleep
in
the
town
-
hall
at
the
very
next
meeting
;
and
,
in
full
proof
of
his
sincerity
,
have
request
us
to
write
this
faithful
narrative
.
 
<EOS>
We
wish
it
could
have
the
effect
of
remind
the
tulrumble
of
another
sphere
,
that
puff
-
up
conceit
be
not
dignity
,
and
that
snarl
at
the
little
pleasure
they
be
once
glad
to
enjoy
,
because
they
would
rather
forget
the
time
when
they
be
of
low
station
,
render
them
object
of
contempt
and
ridicule
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
the
first
time
we
have
publish
any
of
our
gleaning
from
this
particular
source
.
 
<EOS>
perhaps
,
at
some
future
period
,
we
may
venture
to
open
the
chronicle
of
Mudfog

<EOS>
Full
Report
of
the
first
Meeting
of
the
Mudfog
Association
for
the
Advancement

Everything
    
<EOS>
We
have
make
the
most
unparalleled
and
extraordinary
exertion
to
place
before
our
reader
a
complete
and
accurate
account
of
the
proceeding
at
the
late
grand
meeting
of
the
Mudfog
Association
,
holden
in
the
town
of
Mudfog
;
it
afford
us
great
happiness
to
lay
the
result
before
them
,
in
the
shape
of
various
communication
receive
from
our
able
,
talented
,
and
graphic
correspondent
,
expressly
send
down
for
the
purpose
,
who
have
immortalize
us
,
himself
,
Mudfog
,
and
the
association
,
all
at
one
and
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
We
have
be
,
indeed
,
for
some
day
unable
to
determine
who
will
transmit
the
great
name
to
posterity
;
ourselves
,
who
send
our
correspondent
down
;
our
correspondent
,
who
write
an
account
of
the
matter
;
or
the
association
,
who
give
our
correspondent
something
to
write
about
.
 
<EOS>
We
rather
incline
to
the
opinion
that
we
be
the
great
man
of
the
party
,
inasmuch
as
the
notion
of
an
exclusive
and
authentic
report
originate
with
us
;
this
may
be
prejudice
:
 
<EOS>
it
may
arise
from
a
prepossession
on
our
part
in
our
own
favour
.
 
<EOS>
be
it
so
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
no
doubt
that
every
gentleman
concern
in
this
mighty
assemblage
be
trouble
with
the
same
complaint
in
a
great
or
less
degree
;
and
it
be
a
consolation
to
us
to
know
that
we
have
at
least
this
feeling
in
common
with
the
great
scientific
star
,
the
brilliant
and
extraordinary
luminary
,
whose
speculation
we
record
.
  
<EOS>
We
give
our
correspondent
's
letter
in
the
order
in
which
they
reach
us
.
 
<EOS>
any
attempt
at
amalgamate
them
into
one
beautiful
whole
,
would
only
destroy
that
glow
tone
,
that
dash
of
wildness
,
and
rich
vein
of
picturesque
interest
,
which
pervade
them
throughout

I
have
just

from

personal
interview
with
the
landlord
of

He
speak
confidently
of

probability
of
Professors
Snore

Doze
,

Wheezy
take
up
their
residence
at
his
house
during

deny
that
the

in

representation
he
be
confirm
by
the
chambermaid

a
girl
of
artless
manner

boot
deny
that
it
be
at
all
likely
that
Professors
Snore
,
Doze
,
and
Wheezy
will
put
up
here
;
but
I
have
reason
to
believe
that
this
man
have
be
suborn
by
the
proprietor
of
the
Original
Pig
,
which
be
the
opposition

<EOS>
amidst
such
conflicting
testimony
it

you
may
depend

respect
he
only
place
him
upon

level

rest

He
would
further
suggest

should
be
place

control

regulation
of

who
should
set
apart

consciousness

loneliness

shall
ever
feel
grateful

by
thrust

one
bear
,
indeed
,
---
a
brown
and
ragged
animal

---
have
linger
about
the
haunt
of
his
former
triumph
,
with
a
worn
and
dejected
visage
and
feeble
limb
,
and
have
essay
to
wield
his
quarter
-
staff
for
the
amusement
of
the
multitude
;
but
hunger
,
and
an
utter
want
of
any
due
recompense
for
his
ability
,
have
at
length
drive
him
from
the
field
,
and
it
be
only
too
probable
that
he
have
fall
a
sacrifice
to
the
rise
taste
for
grease
.
 
<EOS>
He
regret
to
add
that
a
similar
,
and
no
less
lamentable
,
change
have
take
place
with
reference
to
monkey
.
 
<EOS>
these
delightful
animal
have
formerly
be
almost
as
plentiful
as
the
organ
on
the
top
of
which
they
be
accustomed
to
sit
;
the
proportion
in
the
year
1829
(
it
appear
by
the
parliamentary
return
)
be
as
one
monkey
to
three
organ
.
 
<EOS>
Owing
,
however
,
to
an
altered
taste
in
musical
instrument
,
and
the
substitution
,
in
a
great
measure
,
of
narrow
box
of
music
for
organ
,
which
leave
the
monkey
nothing
to
sit
upon
,
this
source
of
public
amusement
be
wholly
dry
up
.
<EOS>
consider
it
a
matter
of
the
deep
importance
,
in
connection
with
national
education
,
that
the
people
should
not
lose
such
opportunity
of
make
themselves
acquaint
with
the
manner
and
custom
of
two
most
interesting
specie
of
animal
,

submit
that

should

take
for
the
restoration

truly
intellectual

<EOS>
on

he
believe
that
they
have

the

of

very
incorrect

imperfect
notion
on

<EOS>
He
speak
from

when
he

that

from
what
they

in

the

that
all

that

wish
to
know
distinctly
whether
the

attribute
the
want
of
encouragement

bear
have
meet
with
to
the
decline
of

taste
in

Mr

reply
,
that
he

that

talent
among

PROFESSOR

wish
to
take
that
opportunity

call
the
attention
of
the
section
to
a
most
important

serious
point
.
<EOS>
the
author
of
the
treatise
just
read
have
allude
to
the
prevalent
taste
for
bears'-grease
as
a
means
of
promote
the
growth
of
hair
,
which
undoubtedly
be
diffuse
to
a
very
great
<EOS>
and
(
as
it
appear
to
him
)
very
alarming
extent
.
 
<EOS>
no
gentleman
attend
that
section
could
fail
to
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
youth
of
the
present
age
evince
,
by
their
behaviour
in
the
street
,
and
at
all
place
of
public
resort
,
a
considerable
lack
of
that
gallantry
and
gentlemanly
feeling
which
,
in
more
ignorant
time
,
have
be
think
become
.
 
<EOS>
He
wish
to
know
whether
it
be
possible
that
a
constant
outward
application
of
bears'-grease
by
the
young
gentleman
about
town
have
imperceptibly
infuse
into
those
unhappy
person
something
of
the
nature
and
quality
of
the
bear
.
 
<EOS>
He
shudder
as
he
throw
out
the
remark
;
but
if
this
theory
,
on
inquiry
,
should
prove
to
be
well
found
,
it
would
at
once
explain
a
great
deal

nothing

the
influence

brutish
appetite

dreadful

necessity

provide

harmless
and
wholesome
relaxation

the
young
nobleman

His
proposition
be
,
that
a
space
of
ground
of
not
less
than
ten
mile
in
length
and
four
in
breadth
should
be
purchase
by
a

company

Act

inclose
by
a
brick
wall
of
not
less
than
twelve
foot
in
height

propose
that
it
should

lay
out
with
highway
road

turnpike
,
bridge
,
miniature
village
,
and
every
object
that
could
conduce
to
the
comfort

glory
of

in
-
hand

so
that
they
may
be
fairly
presume
to
require
no
drive
beyond
it
.
 
<EOS>
this
delightful
retreat
would
be
fit
up
with
most
commodious
and
extensive
stable
,
for
the
convenience
of
such
of
the
nobility
and
gentry
as
have
a
taste
for
ostlering
,
and
with
house
of
entertainment
furnish
in
the
most
expensive
and
handsome
style
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
further
provide
with
whole
street
of
door
-
knocker
and
bell
-
handle
of
extra
size
,
so
construct
that
they
could
be
easily
wrench
off
at
night
,
and
regularly
screw
on
again
,
by
attendant
provide
for
the
purpose
,
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
there
would
also
be
gas
lamp
of
real
glass
,
which
could
be
break
at
a
comparatively
small
expense
per
dozen
,
and
a
broad
and
handsome
foot
pavement
for
gentleman
to
drive
their
cabriolet
upon
when
they
be
humorously
dispose
---
for
the
full
enjoyment
of
which
feat
live
pedestrian
would
be
procure
from
the
workhouse
at
a
very
small
charge
per
head

<EOS>
the
place
be
inclose
,
and
carefully
screen
from
the
intrusion
of
the
public

would
be
no
objection

aside
any
article
of
their
costume
that
be
consider
to
interfere
with
a
pleasant
frolic
,

,
indeed
,
to
their
walk
about
without
any
costume
at
all

better

facility

enjoyment

afford
that

most
gentlemanly
person
could
possibly
desire
.

as
even
these
advantage
would
be
incomplete
unless
there
be
some
mean
provide
of
enable
the
nobility
and
gentry
to
display
their
prowess
when
they
sally
forth
after
dinner
,
and
as
some
inconvenience
may
be
experience
in
the
event
of
their
be
reduce
to
the
necessity
of
pummel
each
other
,
the
inventor
have
turn
his
attention
to
the
construction
of
an
entirely
new
police
force

compose
exclusively
of
automaton
figure

with

assistance
of
the
ingenious
Signor

nicety

that

cab

driver

make
upon
the
principle
of

model
exhibit

would
walk
about
until
knock
down

any
real
man

nay

more
,
if
set
upon
and
beat
by
six

eight
nobleman

after
it
be
down

the
figure
would
utter
diver
groan
,
mingle
with
entreaty
for
mercy
,
thus
render
the
illusion
complete
,
and
the
enjoyment
perfect
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
invention
do
not
stop
even
here
;
for
station
-
house
would
be
build
,
contain
good
bed
for
nobleman
and
gentleman
during
the
night
,
and
in
the
morning
they
would
repair
to
a
commodious
police
office
,
where
a
pantomimic
investigation
would
take
place
before
the
automaton
magistrates
,
---
quite
equal
to
life

---
who
would
fine
them
in
so
many
counter
,
with
which
they
would
be
previously
provide
for
the
purpose

this
office
would
be
furnish
with
an
inclined
plane
,
for
the
convenience
of
any
nobleman

gentleman
who
may
wish
to
bring
in
his
horse
as
a
witness
;
and
the
prisoner
would
be
at
perfect
liberty
,
as
they
be
now
,
to
interrupt
the
complainant
as
much
as
they
please
,
and
to
make
any
remark
that
they
think
proper
.
 
<EOS>
the
charge
for
these
amusement
would
amount
to
very
little
more
than
they
already
cost

the
inventor
submit
that
the
public
would
be
much
benefit
and
comfort
by
the
propose
arrangement

award
the
utmost
merit

the
ingenious

have
originate

doubt
whether

answer

fear

Mr

submit
,
that
as
the
usual
odd
in

be
ten
nobleman

gentleman
to
one
policeman

cab

driver
,
it
could
make
very
little
difference
in
point
of
excitement
whether
the
policeman
or
cab

driver
be
a
man
or
a
block

<EOS>
the
great
advantage
would
be
,
that
a
policeman
's
limb
may
be
all
knock
off
,
and
yet
he
would
be
in
a
condition
to
do
duty
next

<EOS>
He
may
even
give

it
equally

complete
belief

Thorn

recently
shoot
at
Canterbury

in
the
Homoeopathic
system

<EOS>
the

would
bear
in

that
one
of

Homoeopathic
doctrine
be
,
that
infinitesimal
dose
of
any

would
occasion
the
disease

it

would
restore

<EOS>
what
be
the
obvious
inference
?
 
<EOS>
that
Thorn
,
who
be
march
and
countermarch
in
osier
bed

and
other
swampy
place
,
be

in

his

he
could
not

have

bring

prescription

it

if

infinitesimal
dose

immediately
after

unhappily
the

of
these
gigantic
research
and
sublime
and
noble
triumph
without
repeat
a
BON
MOT
of
Professor
Woodensconce
's
,
which
show
how
the
great
mind
may
occasionally
unbend
when
truth
can
be
present
to
listen
ear
,
clothe
in
an
attractive
and
playful
form
.
 
<EOS>
I
be
stand
by
,
when
,
after
a
week
of
feasting
and
feeding
,
that
learn
gentleman
,
accompany
by
the
whole
body
of
wonderful
man
,
enter
the
hall
yesterday
,
where
a
sumptuous
dinner
be
prepare
;
where
the
rich
wine
sparkle
on
the
board
,
and
fat
buck
---
propitiatory
sacrifice
to
learning
---
send
forth
their
savoury
odour
.
 
<EOS>
"
ah
!
<EOS>
"
say
Professor
Woodensconce
,
rub
his
hand
,
"
this
be
what
we
meet
for
;
this
be
what
inspire
us
;
this
be
what
keep
us
together
,
and
beckon
us
onward
;
this
be
the
spread
of
science

and
a
glorious
spread
it

<EOS>
the
Pantomime
of
Life
    
<EOS>
before
we
plunge
headlong
into
this
paper
,
let
us
at
once
confess
to
a
fondness
for
pantomime
---
to
a
gentle
sympathy
with
clown
and
pantaloon
---
to
an
unqualified
admiration
of
harlequin
and
columbine
---
to
a
chaste
delight
in
every
action
of
their
brief
existence
,
varied
and
many
-
coloured
as
those
action
be
,
and
inconsistent
though
they
occasionally
be
with
those
rigid
and
formal
rule
of
propriety
which
regulate
the
proceeding
of
meaner
and
less
comprehensive
mind
.
 
<EOS>
We
revel
in
pantomime
---
not
because
they
dazzle
one
's
eye
with
tinsel
and
gold
leaf
;
not
because
they
present
to
us
,
once
again
,
the
well
-
beloved
chalked
face
,
and
goggle
eye
of
our
childhood
;
not
even
because
,
like
Christmas
-
day
,
and
twelfth
-
night
,
and
Shrove
-
Tuesday
,
and
one
's
own
birthday
,
they
come
to
us
but
once
a
year
;
---
our
attachment
be
found
on
a
graver
and
a
very
different
reason
.
 
<EOS>
a
pantomime
be
to
us
,
a
mirror
of
life
;
nay
,
more
,
we
maintain
that
it
be
so
to
audience
generally
,
although
they
be
not
aware
of
it
,
and
that
this
very
circumstance
be
the
secret
cause
of
their
amusement
and
delight
.
  
<EOS>
let
us
take
a
slight
example
.
 
<EOS>
the
scene
be
a
street
:
 
an
elderly
gentleman
,
with
a
large
face
and
strongly
marked
feature
,
appear
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
beam
with
a
sunny
smile
,
and
a
perpetual
dimple
be
on
his
broad
,
red
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
evidently
an
opulent
elderly
gentleman
,
comfortable
in
circumstance
,
and
well
-
to
-
do
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
not
unmindful
of
the
adornment
of
his
person
,
for
he
be
richly
,
not
to
say
gaudily
,
dress
;
and
that
he
indulge
to
a
reasonable
extent
in
the
pleasure
of
the
table
may
be
infer
from
the
joyous
and
oily
manner
in
which
he
rub
his
stomach
,
by
way
of
inform
the
audience
that
he
be
go
home
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
in
the
fulness
of
his
heart
,
in
the
fancied
security
of
wealth
,
in
the
possession
and
enjoyment
of
all
the
good
thing
of
life
,
the
elderly
gentleman
suddenly
lose
his
footing
,
and
stumble
.
 
<EOS>
how
the
audience
roar
!
 
<EOS>
He
be
set
upon
by
a
noisy
and
officious
crowd
,
who
buffet
and
cuff
him
unmercifully
.
 
<EOS>
They
scream
with
delight
!
<EOS>
every
time
the
elderly
gentleman
struggle
to
get
up
,
his
relentless
persecutor
knock
him
down
again
.
 
<EOS>
the
spectator
be
convulse
with
merriment
!
 
<EOS>
and
when
at
last
the
elderly
gentleman
do
get
up
,
and
stagger
away
,
despoil
of
hat
,
wig
,
and
clothing
,
himself
batter
to
piece
,
and
his
watch
and
money
go
,
they
be
exhaust
with
laughter
,
and
express
their
merriment
and
admiration
in
round
of
applause
.
  
<EOS>
be
this
like
life
?
 
<EOS>
change
the
scene
to
any
real
street
;
---
to
the
Stock
Exchange
,
or
the
City
banker
's
;
the
merchant
's
counting
-
house
,
or
even
the
tradesman
's
shop
.
 
<EOS>
see
any
one
of
these
man
fall
,
---
the
more
suddenly
,
and
the
nearer
the
zenith
of
his
pride
and
rich
,
the
well
.
 
<EOS>
what
a
wild
hallo
be
raise
over
his
prostrate
carcase
by
the
shouting
mob
;
how
they
whoop
and
yell
as
he
lie
humble
beneath
them
!
 
<EOS>
Mark
<EOS>
how
eagerly
they
set
upon
him
when
he
be
down
;
and
how
they
mock
and
deride
him
as
he
slink
away
.
 
<EOS>
why
,
it
be
the
pantomime
to
the
very
letter
.
  
<EOS>
of
all
the
pantomimic
dramati
PERSONAE
,
we
consider
the
pantaloon
the
most
worthless
and
debauch
.
 
<EOS>
Independent
of
the
dislike
one
naturally
feel
at
see
a
gentleman
of
his
year
engage
in
pursuit
highly
unbecoming
his
gravity
and
time
of
life
,
we
can
not
conceal
from
ourselves
the
fact
that
he
be
a
treacherous
,
worldly
-
minded
old
villain
,
constantly
entice
his
young
companion
,
the
clown
,
into
act
of
fraud
or
petty
larceny
,
and
generally
stand
aside
to
watch
the
result
of
the
enterprise
.
 
<EOS>
if
it
be
successful
,
he
never
forget
to
return
for
his
share
of
the
spoil
;
but
if
it
turn
out
a
failure
,
he
generally
retire
with
remarkable
caution
and
expedition
,
and
keep
carefully
aloof
until
the
affair
have
blow
over
.
 
<EOS>
His
amorous
propensity
,
too
,
be
eminently
disagreeable
;
and
his
mode
of
address
lady
in
the
open
street
at
noon
-
day
be
down
-
right
improper
,
be
usually
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
perceptible
tickling
of
the
aforesaid
lady
in
the
waist
,
after
commit
which
<EOS>
,
he
start
back
,
manifestly
ashamed
(
<EOS>
as
well
he
may
be
)
of
his
own
indecorum
and
temerity
;
continuing
,
nevertheless
,
to
ogle
and
beckon
to
them
from
a
distance
in
a
very
unpleasant
and
immoral
manner
.
  
<EOS>
be
there
any
man
who
can
not
count
a
dozen
pantaloon
in
his
own
social
circle
?
 
<EOS>
be
there
any
man
who
have
not
see
them
swarm
at
the
west
end
of
the
town
on
a
sunshiny
day
or
a
summer
's
evening
,
go
through
the
last
-
name
pantomimic
feat
with
as
much
liquorish
energy
,
and
as
total
an
absence
of
reserve
,
as
if
they
be
on
the
very
stage
itself
?
 
<EOS>
We
can
tell
upon
our
finger
a
dozen
pantaloon
of
our
acquaintance
at
this
moment
---
capital
pantaloon
,
who
have
be
perform
all
kind
of
strange
freak
,
to
the
great
amusement
of
their
friend
and
acquaintance
,
for
year
past
;
and
who
to
this
day
be
make
such
comical
and
ineffectual
attempt
to
be
young
and
dissolute
,
that
all
beholder
be
like
to
die
with
laughter
.
  
<EOS>
take
that
old
gentleman
who
have
just
emerge
from
the
CAFE
DE
L'EUROPE
in
the
Haymarket
,
where
he
have
be
dine
at
the
expense
of
the
young
man
upon
town
with
whom
he
shake
hand
as
they
part
at
the
door
of
the
tavern
.
 
<EOS>
the
affected
warmth
of
that
shake
of
the
hand
,
the
courteous
nod
,
the
obvious
recollection
of
the
dinner
,
the
savoury
flavour
of
which
still
hang
upon
his
lip
,
be
all
characteristic
of
his
great
prototype
.
 
<EOS>
He
hobble
away
hum
an
opera
tune
,
and
twirl
his
cane
to
and
fro
,
with
affect
carelessness
.
 
<EOS>
suddenly
he
stop
---
'
tis
at
the
milliner
's
window
.
 
<EOS>
He
peep
through
one
of
the
large
pane
of
glass
;
and
,
his
view
of
the
lady
within
be
obstruct
by
the
India
shawl
,
direct
his
attention
to
the
young
girl
with
the
band
-
box
in
her
hand
,
who
be
gaze
in
at
the
window
also
.
 
<EOS>
see
!
<EOS>
he
draw
beside
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
cough
;
she
turn
away
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
draw
near
her
again
;
she
disregard
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
gleefully
chuck
her
under
the
chin
,
and
,
retreat
a
few
step
,
nod
and
beckon
with
fantastic
grimace
,
while
the
girl
bestow
a
contemptuous
and
supercilious
look
upon
his
wrinkle
visage
.
 
<EOS>
She
turn
away
with
a
flounce
,
and
the
old
gentleman
trot
after
her
with
a
toothless
chuckle
.
<EOS>
the
pantaloon
to
the
life
!
   
<EOS>
but
the
close
resemblance
which
the
clown
of
the
stage
bear
to
those
of
every
-
day
life
be
perfectly
extraordinary
.
 
<EOS>
some
people
talk
with
a
sigh
of
the
decline
of
pantomime
,
and
murmur
in
low
and
dismal
tone
the
name
of
Grimaldi
.
 
<EOS>
We
mean
no
disparagement
to
the
worthy
and
excellent
old
man
when
we
say
that
this
be
downright
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
clown
that
beat
Grimaldi
all
to
nothing
turn
up
every
day
,
and
nobody
patronize
them
---
more
be
the
pity
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
who
you
mean
,
"
say
some
dirty
-
faced
patron
of
Mr
Osbaldistone
's
,
lay
down
the
Miscellany
when
he
have
get
thus
far
,
and
bestow
upon
vacancy
a
most
know
glance
;
"
you
mean
C
J
Smith
as
do
Guy
Fawkes
,
and
George
Barnwell
at
the
Garden
.
<EOS>
"
the
dirty
-
faced
gentleman
have
hardly
utter
the
word
,
when
he
be
interrupt
by
a
young
gentleman
in
no
shirt
-
collar
and
a
Petersham
coat
.
 
<EOS>
"
no
,
no
,
"
say
the
young
gentleman
;
"
he
mean
Brown
,
King
,
and
Gibson
,
at
the
"
Delphi
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
now
,
with
great
deference
both
to
the
first
-
name
gentleman
with
the
dirty
face
,
and
the
last
-
name
gentleman
in
the
non

exist
shirt
-
collar
,
we
do
not
mean
either
the
performer
who
so
grotesquely
burlesque
the
popish
conspirator
,
or
the
three
unchangeable
who
have
be
dance
the
same
dance
under
different
imposing
title
,
and
do
the
same
thing
under
various
high
-
sound
name
for
some
five
or
six
year
last
past
.
<EOS>
We
have
no
sooner
make
this
avowal
,
than
the
public
,
who
have
hitherto
be
silent
witness
of
the
dispute
,
inquire
what
on
earth
<EOS>
it
be
we
do
mean
;
and
,
with
become
respect
,
we
proceed
to
tell
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
well
known
to
all
playgoer
and
pantomime
-
seer
,
that
the
scene
in
which
a
theatrical
clown
be
at
the
very
height
of
his
glory
be
those
which
be
describe
in
the
play
-
bill
as
"
Cheesemonger
's
shop
and
Crockery
warehouse
,
"
or
"
Tailor
's
shop
,
and
Mrs
Queertable
's
boarding
-
house
,
"
or
place
bear
some
such
title
,
where
the
great
fun
of
the
thing
consist
in
the
hero
's
take
lodging
which
he
have
not
the
slight
intention
of
pay
for
,
or
obtain
good
under
false
pretence
,
or
abstract
the
stock
-
in
-
trade
of
the
respectable
shopkeeper
next
door
,
or
rob
warehouse
porter
as
they
pass
under
his
window
,
or
,
to
shorten
the
catalogue
,
in
his
swindle
everybody
he
possibly
can
,
it
only
remain
to
be
observe
that
,
the
more
extensive
the
swindling
be
,
and
the
more
bareface
the
impudence
of
the
swindler
,
the
great
<EOS>
the
rapture
and
ecstasy
of
the
audience
.
 
<EOS>
now
it
be
a
most
remarkable
fact
that
precisely
this
sort
of
thing
occur
in
real
life
day
after
day
,
and
nobody
see
the
humour
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
let
us
illustrate
our
position
by
detail
the
plot
of
this
portion
of
the
pantomime
---
not
of
the
theatre
,
but
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
the
honourable
captain
Fitz
-
Whisker
Fiercy
,
attend
by
his
livery
servant
Do'em
---
a
most
respectable
servant
to
look
at
,
who
have
grow
grey
in
the
service
of
the
captain
's
family
---
view
,
treat
for
,
and
ultimately
obtain
possession
of
,
the
unfurnished
house
,
such
a
number
,
such
a
street
.
 
<EOS>
all
the
tradesman
in
the
neighbourhood
be
in
agony
of
competition
for
the
captain
's
custom
;
the
captain
be
a
good
-
natured
,
kind
-
hearted
,
easy
man
,
and
,
to
avoid
be
the
cause
of
disappointment
to
any
,
he
most
handsomely
give
order
to
all
.
 
<EOS>
hamper
of
wine
,
basket
of
provision
,
cart
-
load
of
furniture
,
box
of
jewellery
,
supply
of
luxury
of
the
costly
description
,
flock
to
the
house
of
the
honourable
Captain
Fitz
-
Whisker
Fiercy
,
where
they
be
receive
with
the
utmost
readiness
by
the
highly
respectable
Do'em
;
while
the
captain
himself
strut
and
swagger
about
with
that
compound
air
of
conscious
superiority
and
general
blood
-
thirstiness
which
a
military
captain
should
always
,
and
do
most
time
,
wear
,
to
the
admiration
and
terror
of
plebeian
man
.
 
<EOS>
but
the
tradesman
's
back
be
no
sooner
turn
,
than
the
captain
,
with
all
the
eccentricity
of
a
mighty
mind
,
and
assist
by
the
faithful
Do'em
,
whose
devoted
fidelity
be
not
the
least
touching
part
of
his
character
,
dispose
of
everything
to
great
advantage
;
for
,
although
the
article
fetch
small
sum
,
still
they
be
sell
considerably
above
cost
price
,
the
cost
to
the
captain
have
be
nothing
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
after
various
manoeuvre
,
the
imposture
be
discover
,
Fitz
-
Fiercy
and
Do'em
be
recognize
as
confederate
,
and
the
police
office
to
which
they
be
both
take
be
throng
with
their
dupe
.
  
<EOS>
who
can
fail
to
recognize
in
this
,
the
exact
counterpart
of
the
good
portion
of
a
theatrical
pantomime
---
Fitz
-
Whisker
Fiercy
by
the
clown
;
Do'em
by
the
pantaloon
;
and
supernumerary
by
the
tradesman
?
 
<EOS>
the
good
of
the
joke
,
too
,
be
,
that
the
very
coal
-
merchant
who
be
loud
in
his
complaint
against
the
person
who
defraud
him
,
be
the
identical
man
who
sit
in
the
centre
of
the
very
front
row
of
the
pit
last
night
and
laugh
the
most
boisterously
at
this
very
same
thing
,
---
and
not
so
well
do
either
.
 
<EOS>
talk
of
Grimaldi
,
we
say
again
!
 
<EOS>
do
Grimaldi
,
in
his
good
day
,
ever
do
anything
in
this
way
equal
to
Da
Costa
?
  
<EOS>
the
mention
of
this
latter
justly
celebrate
clown
remind
us
of
his
last
piece
of
humour
,
<EOS>
the
fraudulently
obtain
certain
stamped
acceptance
from
a
young
gentleman
in
the
army
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
scarcely
lay
down
our
pen
to
contemplate
for
a
few
moment
this
admirable
actor
's
performance
of
that
exquisite
practical
joke
,
than
a
new
branch
of
our
subject
flash
suddenly
upon
us
.
 
<EOS>
so
we
take
it
up
again
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
all
people
who
have
be
behind
the
scene
,
and
most
people
who
have
be
before
them
,
know
,
that
in
the
representation
of
a
pantomime
,
a
good
many
man
be
send
upon
the
stage
for
the
express
purpose
of
be
cheat
,
or
knock
down
,
or
both
.
 
<EOS>
now
,
down
to
a
moment
ago
,
we
have
never
be
able
to
understand
for
what
possible
purpose
a
great
number
of
odd
,
lazy
,
large
-
head
man
,
whom
one
be
in
the
habit
of
meeting
here
,
and
there
,
and
everywhere
,
could
ever
have
be
create
.
 
<EOS>
We
see
it
all
,
now
.
 
<EOS>
They
be
the
supernumerary
in
the
pantomime
of
life
;
the
man
who
have
be
thrust
into
it
,
with
no
other
view
than
to
be
constantly
tumble
over
each
other
,
and
run
their
head
against
all
sort
of
strange
thing
.
 
<EOS>
We
sit
opposite
to
one
of
these
man
at
a
supper
-
table
,
only
last
week
.
 
<EOS>
now
we
think
of
it
<EOS>
,
he
be
exactly
like
the
gentleman
with
the
pasteboard
head
and
face
,
who
do
the
correspond
business
in
the
theatrical
pantomime
;
there
be
the
same
broad
stolid
simper
---
the
same
dull
leaden
eye
---
<EOS>
the
same
unmeaning
,
vacant
stare
;
and
whatever
be
say
,
or
whatever
be
do
,
he
always
come
in
at
precisely
the
wrong
place
,
or
jostle
against
something
that
he
have
not
the
slight
business
with
.
 
<EOS>
We
look
at
the
man
across
the
table
again
and
again
;
and
could
not
satisfy
ourselves
what
race
of
being
to
class
him
with
.
 
<EOS>
how
very
odd
that
this
never
occur
to
us
before
!
  
<EOS>
We
will
frankly
own
that
we
have
be
much
trouble
with
the
harlequin
.
 
<EOS>
We
see
harlequin
of
so
many
kind
in
the
real
living
pantomime
,
that
we
hardly
know
which
to
select
as
the
proper
fellow
of
him
of
the
theatre
.
 
<EOS>
at
one
time
we
be
dispose
to
think
that
the
harlequin
be
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
young
man
of
family
and
independent
property
,
who
have
run
away
with
an
opera
-
dancer
,
and
be
fool
his
life
and
his
mean
away
in
light
and
trivial
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
on
reflection
,
however
,
we
remember
that
harlequin
be
occasionally
guilty
of
witty
,
and
even
clever
act
,
and
we
be
rather
disposed
to
acquit
our
young
man
of
family
and
independent
property
,
generally
speak
,
of
any
such
misdemeanour
.
 
<EOS>
on
a
more
mature
consideration
of
the
subject
,
we
have
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
the
harlequin
of
life
be
just
ordinary
man
,
to
be
find
in
no
particular
walk
or
degree
,
on
whom
a
certain
station
,
or
particular
conjunction
of
circumstance
,
confer
the
magic
wand
.
<EOS>
and
this
bring
us
to
a
few
word
on
the
pantomime
of
public
and
political
life
,
which
we
shall
say
at
once
,
and
then
conclude
---
merely
premise
in
this
place
that
we
decline
any
reference
whatever
to
the
columbine
,
be
in
no
wise
satisfied
of
the
nature
of
her
connection
with
her
parti
-
coloured
lover
,
and
not
feel
by
any
mean
clear
that
we
should
be
justify
in
introduce
her
to
the
virtuous
and
respectable
lady
who
peruse
our
lucubration
.
  
<EOS>
We
take
it
that
the
commencement
of
a
Session
of
Parliament
be
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
drawing
up
of
the
curtain
for
a
grand
comic
pantomime
,
and
that
his
Majesty
's
most
gracious
speech
on
the
opening
thereof
may
be
not
inaptly
compare
to
the
clown
's
open
speech
of
"
here
we
be
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
lord
and
gentleman
,
here
we
be
!
<EOS>
"
appear
,
to
our
mind
at
least
,
to
be
a
very
good
abstract
of
the
point
and
meaning
of
the
propitiatory
address
of
the
ministry
.
<EOS>
when
we
remember
how
frequently
this
speech
be
make
,
immediately
after
the
CHANGE
too
,
the
parallel
be
quite
perfect
,
and
still
more
singular
.
  
<EOS>
perhaps
the
cast
of
our
political
pantomime
never
be
rich
than
at
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
particularly
strong
in
clown
.
 
<EOS>
at
no
former
time
,
we
should
say
,
have
we
have
such
astonishing
tumbler
,
or
performer
so
ready
to
go
through
the
whole
of
their
feat
for
the
amusement
of
an
admiring
throng
.
 
<EOS>
Their
extreme
readiness
to
exhibit
,
indeed
,
have
give
rise
to
some
ill
-
natured
reflection
;
it
have
be
object
that
by
exhibit
gratuitously
through
the
country
when
the
theatre
be
closed
,
they
reduce
themselves
to
the
level
of
mountebank
,
and
thereby
tend
to
degrade
the
respectability
of
the
profession
.
 
<EOS>
certainly
Grimaldi
never
do
this
sort
of
thing
;
and
though
Brown
,
King
,
and
Gibson
have
go
to
the
Surrey
in
vacation
time
,
and
Mr
C
J
Smith
have
ruralise
at
Sadler
's
well
,
we
find
no
theatrical
precedent
for
a
general
tumble
through
the
country
,
except
in
the
gentleman
,
name
unknown
,
who
throw
summerset
on
behalf
of
the
late
Mr
Richardson
,
and
who
be
no
authority
either
,
because
he
have
never
be
on
the
regular
board
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
lay
aside
this
question
,
which
after
all
be
a
mere
matter
of
taste
,
we
may
reflect
with
pride
and
gratification
of
heart
on
the
proficiency
of
our
clown
as
exhibit
in
the
season
.
 
<EOS>
night
after
night
will
they
twist
and
tumble
about
,
till
two
,
three
,
and
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
;
play
the
strange
antic
,
and
give
each
other
the
funniest
slap
on
the
face
that
can
possibly
be
imagine
,
without
evince
the
small
token
of
fatigue
.
 
<EOS>
the
strange
noise
,
the
confusion
,
the
shouting
and
roaring
,
amid
which
all
this
be
do
,
too
,
would
put
to
shame
the
most
turbulent
sixpenny
gallery
that
ever
yell
through
a
boxing
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
especially
curious
to
behold
one
of
these
clown
compel
to
go
through
the
most
surprising
contortion
by
the
irresistible
influence
of
the
wand
of
office
,
which
his
leader
or
harlequin
hold
above
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
act
upon
by
this
wonderful
charm
he
will
become
perfectly
motionless
,
move
neither
hand
,
foot
,
nor
finger
,
and
will
even
lose
the
faculty
of
speech
at
an
instant
's
notice
;
or
on
the
other
hand
,
he
will
become
all
life
and
animation
if
require
,
pour
forth
a
torrent
of
word
without
sense
or
meaning
,
throw
himself
into
the
wild
and
most
fantastic
contortion
,
and
even
grovel
on
the
earth
and
lick
up
the
dust
.
 
<EOS>
these
exhibition
be
more
curious
than
pleasing
;
indeed
,
they
be
rather
disgusting
than
otherwise
,
except
to
the
admirer
of
such
thing
,
with
whom
we
confess
we
have
no
fellow
-
feeling
.
  
<EOS>
strange
trick
---
very
strange
trick
---
be
also
perform
by
the
harlequin
who
hold
for
the
time
be
the
magic
wand
which
we
have
just
mention
.
 
<EOS>
the
mere
wave
it
before
a
man
's
eye
will
dispossess
his
brain
of
all
the
notion
previously
store
there
,
and
fill
it
with
an
entirely
new
set
of
idea
;
one
gentle
tap
on
the
back
will
alter
the
colour
of
a
man
's
coat
completely
;
and
there
be
some
expert
performer
,
who
,
have
this
wand
hold
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
,
will
change
from
side
to
side
,
turn
their
coat
at
every
evolution
,
with
so
much
rapidity
and
dexterity
,
that
the
quick
eye
can
scarcely
detect
their
motion
.
<EOS>
occasionally
,
the
genius
who
confer
the
wand
,
wrest
it
from
the
hand
of
the
temporary
possessor
,
and
consign
it
to
some
new
performer
;
on
which
occasion
all
the
character
change
side
,
and
then
the
race
and
the
hard
knock
begin
anew
.
  
<EOS>
We
may
have
extend
this
chapter
to
a
much
great
length
---
we
may
have
carry
the
comparison
into
the
liberal
profession
---
we
may
have
show
,
as
be
in
fact
our
original
purpose
,
that
each
be
in
itself
a
little
pantomime
with
scene
and
character
of
its
own
,
complete
;
but
,
as
we
fear
we
have
be
quite
lengthy
enough
already
,
we
shall
leave
this
chapter
just
where
it
be
.
 
<EOS>
a
gentleman
,
not
altogether
unknown
as
a
dramatic
poet
,
write
thus
a
year
or
two
ago
---
  
<EOS>
"
all
the
world
be
a
stage
,
and
all
the
man
and
woman
merely
player
:
"
  
and
<EOS>
we
,
track
out
his
footstep
at
the
scarcely
-
worth
-
mention
little
distance
of
a
few
million
of
league
behind
,
venture
to
add
,
by
way
of
new
reading
,
that
he
mean
a
Pantomime
,
and
that
we
be
all
actor
in
the
Pantomime
of
Life
.
    
<EOS>
some
Particulars
concern
a
Lion
    
<EOS>
We
have
a
great
respect
for
lion
in
the
abstract
.
 
<EOS>
in
common
with
most
other
people
,
we
have
hear
and
read
of
many
instance
of
their
bravery
and
generosity
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
duly
admire
that
heroic
self
-
denial
and
charming
philanthropy
which
prompt
them
never
to
eat
people
except
when
they
be
hungry
,
and
we
have
be
deeply
impressed
with
a
become
sense
of
the
politeness
they
be
say
to
display
towards
unmarried
lady
of
a
certain
state
.
 
<EOS>
all
natural
history
teem
with
anecdote
illustrative
of
their
excellent
quality
;
and
one
old
spelling
-
book
in
particular
recount
a
touching
instance
of
an
old
lion
,
of
high
moral
dignity
and
stern
principle
,
who
feel
it
his
imperative
duty
to
devour
a
young
man
who
have
contract
a
habit
of
swear
,
as
a
strike
example
to
the
rise
generation
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
be
extremely
pleasant
to
reflect
upon
,
and
,
indeed
,
say
a
very
great
deal
in
favour
of
lion
as
a
mass
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
bind
to
state
,
however
,
that
such
individual
lion
as
we
have
happen
to
fall
in
with
have
not
put
forth
any
very
striking
characteristic
,
and
have
not
act
up
to
the
chivalrous
character
assign
them
by
their
chronicler
.
 
<EOS>
We
never
see
a
lion
in
what
be
call
his
natural
state
,
certainly
;
that
be
to
say
,
we
have
never
meet
a
lion
out
walk
in
a
forest
,
or
crouch
in
his
lair
under
a
tropical
sun
,
wait
till
his
dinner
should
happen
to
come
by
,
hot
from
the
baker
's
.
 
<EOS>
but
we
have
see
some
under
the
influence
of
captivity
,
and
the
pressure
of
misfortune
;
and
we
must
say
that
they
appear
to
us
very
apathetic
,
heavy
-
head
fellow
.
  
<EOS>
the
lion
at
the
Zoological
Gardens
,
for
instance
.
 
<EOS>
He
be
all
very
well
;
he
have
an
undeniable
mane
,
and
look
very
fierce
;
but
,
Lord
bless
us
!
<EOS>
what
of
that
?
 
<EOS>
the
lion
of
the
fashionable
world
look
just
as
ferocious
,
and
be
the
most
harmless
creature
breathe
.
<EOS>
a
box
-
lobby
lion
or
a
regent
-
street
animal
will
put
on
a
most
terrible
aspect
,
and
roar
,
fearfully
,
if
you
affront
him
;
but
he
will
never
bite
,
and
,
if
you
offer
to
attack
him
manfully
,
will
fairly
turn
tail
and
sneak
off
.
 
<EOS>
doubtless
these
creature
roam
about
sometimes
in
herd
,
and
,
if
they
meet
any
especially
meek
-
looking
and
peaceably
-
dispose
fellow
,
will
endeavour
to
frighten
him
;
but
the
faint
show
of
a
vigorous
resistance
be
sufficient
to
scare
them
even
then
.
 
<EOS>
these
be
pleasant
characteristic
,
whereas
we
make
it
matter
of
distinct
charge
against
the
Zoological
lion
and
his
brother
at
the
fair
,
that
they
be
sleepy
,
dreamy
,
sluggish
quadruped
.
  
<EOS>
We
do
not
remember
to
have
ever
see
one
of
them
perfectly
awake
,
except
at
feed
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
in
every
respect
we
uphold
the
biped
lion
against
their
four
-
foot
namesake
,
and
we
boldly
challenge
controversy
upon
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
with
these
opinion
it
may
be
easily
imagine
that
our
curiosity
and
interest
be
very
much
excite
the
other
day
,
when
a
lady
of
our
acquaintance
call
on
us
and
resolutely
decline
to
accept
our
refusal
of
her
invitation
to
an
evening
party
;
"
for
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
have
get
a
lion
come
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
at
once
retract
our
plea
of
a
prior
engagement
,
and
become
as
anxious
to
go
,
as
we
have
previously
be
to
stay
away
.
  
<EOS>
We
go
early
,
and
post
ourselves
in
an
eligible
part
of
the
drawing
-
room
,
from
whence
we
could
hope
to
obtain
a
full
view
of
the
interesting
animal
.
 
<EOS>
two
or
three
hour
pass
,
the
quadrille
begin
,
<EOS>
the
room
fill
;
but
no
lion
appear
.
 
<EOS>
the
lady
of
the
house
become
inconsolable
,
---
for
it
be
one
of
the
peculiar
privilege
of
these
lion
to
make
solemn
appointment
and
never
keep
them
,
---
when
all
of
a
sudden
there
come
a
tremendous
double
rap
at
the
street
-
door
,
and
the
master
of
the
house
,
after
glide
out
(
unobserved
as
he
flatter
himself
)
to
peep
over
the
banister
,
come
into
the
room
,
rub
his
hand
together
with
great
glee
,
and
cry
out
in
a
very
important
voice
,
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
Mr
---
(
name
the
lion
)
have
this
moment
arrive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
upon
this
,
all
eye
be
turn
towards
the
door
,
and
we
observe
several
young
lady
,
who
have
be
laugh
and
converse
previously
with
great
gaiety
and
good
humour
,
grow
extremely
quiet
and
sentimental
;
while
some
young
gentleman
,
who
have
be
cut
great
figure
in
the
facetious
and
small
-
talk
way
,
suddenly
sink
very
obviously
in
the
estimation
of
the
company
,
and
be
look
upon
with
great
coldness
and
indifference
.
 
<EOS>
even
the
young
man
who
have
be
order
from
the
music
shop
to
play
the
pianoforte
be
visibly
affect
,
and
strike
several
false
note
in
the
excess
of
his
excitement
.
  
<EOS>
all
this
time
there
be
a
great
talking
outside
,
more
than
once
accompany
by
a
loud
laugh
,
and
a
cry
of
"
oh
!
capital
!
<EOS>
excellent
!
"
<EOS>
from
which
we
infer
that
the
lion
be
jocose
,
and
that
these
exclamation
be
occasion
by
the
transport
of
his
keeper
and
our
host
.
 
<EOS>
nor
be
we
deceive
;
for
when
the
lion
at
last
appear
,
we
overhear
his
keeper
,
who
be
a
little
prim
man
,
whisper
to
several
gentleman
of
his
acquaintance
,
with
uplifted
hand
,
and
every
expression
of
half
-
suppress
admiration
,
that
---
(
name
the
lion
again
)
be
in
SUCH
cue
to
-
night
!
  
<EOS>
the
lion
be
a
literary
one
.
 
<EOS>
of
course
,
there
be
a
vast
number
of
people
present
who
have
admire
his
roaring
,
and
be
anxious
to
be
introduce
to
him
;
and
very
pleasant
it
be
to
see
them
bring
up
for
the
purpose
,
and
to
observe
the
patient
dignity
with
which
he
receive
all
their
patting
and
caressing
.
 
<EOS>
this
bring
forcibly
to
our
mind
what
we
have
so
often
witness
at
country
fair
,
where
the
other
lion
be
compel
to
go
through
as
many
form
of
courtesy
as
they
chance
to
be
acquaint
with
,
just
as
often
as
admire
party
happen
to
drop
in
upon
them
.
  
<EOS>
while
the
lion
be
exhibit
in
this
way
,
his
keeper
be
not
idle
,
for
he
mingle
among
the
crowd
,
and
spread
his
praise
most
industriously
.
 
<EOS>
to
one
gentleman
he
whisper
some
very
choice
thing
that
the
noble
animal
have
say
in
the
very
act
of
come
up
-
stair
,
which
,
of
course
,
render
the
mental
effort
still
more
astonishing
;
to
another
he
murmur
a
hasty
account
of
a
grand
dinner
that
have
take
place
the
day
before
,
where
twenty
-
seven
gentleman
have
get
up
all
at
once
to
demand
an
extra
cheer
for
the
lion
;
and
to
the
lady
he
make
sundry
promise
of
intercede
to
procure
the
majestic
brute
's
sign
-
manual
for
their
album
.
 
<EOS>
then
,
there
be
little
private
consultation
in
different
corner
,
relative
to
the
personal
appearance
and
stature
of
the
lion
;
whether
he
be
short
than
they
have
expect
to
see
him
,
or
tall
,
or
thin
,
or
fat
,
or
young
,
or
old
;
whether
he
be
like
his
portrait
,
or
unlike
it
;
and
whether
the
particular
shade
of
his
eye
be
black
,
or
blue
,
or
hazel
,
or
green
,
or
yellow
,
or
mixture
.
 
<EOS>
at
all
these
consultation
the
keeper
assist
;
and
,
in
short
,
the
lion
be
the
sole
and
single
subject
of
discussion
till
they
sit
him
down
to
whist
,
and
then
the
people
relapse
into
their
old
topic
of
conversation
---
themselves
and
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
We
must
confess
that
we
look
forward
with
no
slight
impatience
to
the
announcement
of
supper
;
for
if
you
wish
to
see
a
tame
lion
under
particularly
favourable
circumstance
,
feed
-
time
be
the
period
of
all
other
to
pitch
upon
.
 
<EOS>
We
be
therefore
very
much
delighted
to
observe
a
sensation
among
the
guest
,
which
we
well
know
how
to
interpret
,
and
immediately
afterwards
to
behold
the
lion
escort
the
lady
of
the
house
down
-
stair
.
 
<EOS>
We
offer
our
arm
to
an
elderly
female
of
our
acquaintance
,
who
---
dear
old
soul
!
---
be
the
very
good
person
that
ever
live
,
to
lead
down
to
any
meal
;
for
,
be
the
room
ever
so
small
,
or
the
party
ever
so
large
,
she
be
sure
,
by
some
intuitive
perception
of
the
eligible
,
to
push
and
pull
herself
and
conductor
close
to
the
good
dish
on
the
table
;
---
we
say
we
offer
our
arm
to
this
elderly
female
,
and
,
descend
the
stair
shortly
after
the
lion
,
be
fortunate
enough
to
obtain
a
seat
nearly
opposite
him
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
the
keeper
be
there
already
.
 
<EOS>
He
have
plant
himself
at
precisely
that
distance
from
his
charge
which
afford
him
a
decent
pretext
for
raise
his
voice
,
when
he
address
him
,
to
so
loud
a
key
,
as
could
not
fail
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
whole
company
,
and
immediately
begin
to
apply
himself
seriously
to
the
task
of
bring
the
lion
out
,
and
put
him
through
the
whole
of
his
manoeuvre
.
 
<EOS>
such
flash
of
wit
as
he
elicit
from
the
lion
!
<EOS>
first
of
all
,
they
begin
to
make
pun
upon
a
salt
-
cellar
,
and
then
upon
the
breast
of
a
fowl
,
and
then
upon
the
trifle
;
but
the
good
joke
of
all
be
decidedly
on
the
lobster
salad
,
upon
which
latter
subject
the
lion
come
out
most
vigorously
,
and
,
in
the
opinion
of
the
most
competent
authority
,
quite
outshone
himself
.
 
<EOS>
this
be
a
very
excellent
mode
of
shine
in
society
,
and
be
found
,
we
humbly
conceive
,
upon
the
classic
model
of
the
dialogue
between
Mr
Punch
and
his
friend
the
proprietor
,
wherein
the
latter
take
all
the
up
-
hill
work
,
and
be
content
to
pioneer
to
the
joke
and
repartee
of
Mr
P
himself
,
who
never
fail
to
gain
great
credit
and
excite
much
laughter
thereby
.
 
<EOS>
whatever
it
be
found
on
,
however
,
we
recommend
it
to
all
lion
,
present
and
to
come
;
for
in
this
instance
it
succeed
to
admiration
,
and
perfectly
dazzle
the
whole
body
of
hearer
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
salt
-
cellar
,
and
the
fowl
's
breast
,
and
the
trifle
,
and
the
lobster
salad
be
all
exhausted
,
and
could
not
afford
standing
-
room
for
another
solitary
witticism
,
the
keeper
perform
that
very
dangerous
feat
which
be
still
do
with
some
of
the
caravan
lion
,
although
in
one
instance
it
terminate
fatally
,
of
put
his
head
in
the
animal
's
mouth
,
and
place
himself
entirely
at
its
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
Boswell
frequently
present
a
melancholy
instance
of
the
lamentable
result
of
this
achievement
,
and
other
keeper
and
jackal
have
be
terribly
lacerated
for
their
daring
.
<EOS>
It
be
due
to
our
lion
to
state
,
that
he
condescend
to
be
trifle
with
,
in
the
most
gentle
manner
,
and
finally
go
home
with
the
showman
in
a
hack
cab
:
 
perfectly
peaceable
,
but
slightly
fuddle
.
  
<EOS>
be
in
a
contemplative
mood
,
we
be
lead
to
make
some
reflection
upon
the
character
and
conduct
of
this
genus
of
lion
as
we
walk
homeward
,
and
we
be
not
long
in
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
our
former
impression
in
their
favour
be
very
much
strengthen
and
confirm
by
what
we
have
recently
see
.
 
<EOS>
while
the
other
lion
receive
company
and
compliment
in
a
sullen
,
moody
,
not
to
say
snarling
manner
,
these
appear
flatter
by
the
attention
that
be
pay
them
;
while
those
conceal
themselves
to
the
utmost
of
their
power
from
the
vulgar
gaze
,
these
court
the
popular
eye
,
and
,
unlike
their
brother
,
whom
nothing
short
of
compulsion
will
move
to
exertion
,
be
ever
ready
to
display
their
acquirement
to
the
wonder
throng
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
know
bear
of
undoubted
ability
who
,
when
the
expectation
of
a
large
audience
have
be
wind
up
to
the
utmost
pitch
,
have
peremptorily
refuse
to
dance
;
well
-
teach
monkey
,
who
have
unaccountably
object
to
exhibit
on
the
slack
wire
;
and
elephant
of
unquestioned
genius
,
who
have
suddenly
decline
to
turn
the
barrel
-
organ
;
but
we
never
once
know
or
hear
of
a
biped
lion
,
literary
or
otherwise
,
---
and
we
state
it
as
a
fact
which
be
highly
creditable
to
the
whole
specie
,
---
who
,
occasion
offering
,
do
not
seize
with
avidity
on
any
opportunity
which
be
afford
him
,
of
perform
to
his

content
on

now

I

I
say
I
think

you
will
excuse
me
,
Mr

I
think
,
you
see

that

unfortunately

my

have
the
honour

make

do
not

other
may

I
hate
rank

any

<EOS>
I
have
no
more
respect

Lord

I
have
for

I
may
say
no
more

I
have
for
Mr

<EOS>
therefore
,
that
ere

must
have
be
bear
long

it
be
a
logical
interference
to
defer
,
that
they
neither

them
live
at

<EOS>
so
what
I
mean
be
this
here
,
that
Pope
never
have
no

never
seed

feel

never
smell
no

what

such

the
very
philosophical

Mr

shorthand

writer

as
he
term
himself
---
a
bit
of
equivoque
passing
current
among
his

which
must
give
the
uninitiated
a
vast
idea
of
the
establishment
of
the
ministerial
organ

it

of
reflection

occasion
by
the
dejected

disconsolate
demeanour

Post

We
be
stop
at
some
station

dismount
slowly

the
little
box
in
which
he
sit
in
ghastly
mockery
of
his
old
condition
with
pistol
and
blunderbuss
beside
him

ready
to
shoot
the
first
highwayman
(

who
shall
attempt

stop

now
travel
(

he
dismount
,
I

,
slowly

sadly
,
from

look
mournfully
about
him
as
if

a
signal

survey
the
engine
with
a
look
of
combined
affliction
and
disgust
which
no
word
can
describe

His
scarlet
coat
and
golden
lace
be
tarnish
with
ignoble
smoke

flake
of
soot

fall

bright
green
