 
my
PEDIGREE
and
FAMILY
 
<EOS>
undergo
<EOS>
the
influence
of
the
TENDER
PASSION
 
<EOS>
since
the
day
of
Adam
,
there
have
be
hardly
a
mischief
do
in
this
world
but
a
woman
have
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
<EOS>
ever
since
our
be
a
family
(
and
that
must
be
very
NEAR
Adam
's
time
,
 
so
old
,
noble
,
and
illustrious
be
the
Barrys
,
as
everybody
know
)
<EOS>
woman
have
play
a
mighty
part
with
the
destiny
of
our
race
.
  
<EOS>
I
presume
that
there
be
no
gentleman
in
Europe
that
have
not
hear
of
the
house
of
Barry
of
Barryogue
,
of
the
kingdom
of
Ireland
,
than
which
a
more
famous
name
be
not
to
be
find
in
Gwillim
or
D'Hozier
;
and
though
,
as
a
man
of
the
world
,
I
have
learn
to
despise
heartily
the
claim
of
some
pretender
to
high
birth
who
have
no
more
genealogy
than
the
lacquey
who
clean
my
boot
,
and
though
I
laugh
to
utter
scorn
the
boasting
of
many
of
my
countryman
,
who
be
all
for
descend
from
king
of
Ireland
,
and
talk
of
a
domain
no
big
than
would
feed
a
pig
as
if
it
be
a
principality
;
yet
truth
compel
me
to
assert
that
my
family
be
the
noblest
of
the
island
,
and
,
perhaps
,
of
the
universal
world
;
while
their
possession
,
now
insignificant
and
tear
from
us
by
war
,
by
treachery
,
by
the
loss
of
time
,
by
ancestral
extravagance
,
by
adhesion
to
the
old
faith
and
monarch
,
be
formerly
prodigious
,
and
embrace
many
county
,
at
a
time
when
Ireland
be
vastly
more
prosperous
than
now
.
<EOS>
I
would
assume
the
irish
crown
over
my
coat
-
of
-
arm
,
but
that
there
be
so
many
silly
pretender
to
that
distinction
who
bear
it
and
render
it
common
.
  
<EOS>
who
know
,
but
for
the
fault
of
a
woman
,
I
may
have
be
wear
it
now
?
<EOS>
You
start
with
incredulity
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
why
not
?
<EOS>
have
there
be
a
gallant
chief
to
lead
my
countryman
,
instead
or
pule
knave
who
bend
the
knee
to
King
Richard
II
.
<EOS>
,
they
may
have
be
freeman
;
have
there
be
a
resolute
leader
to
meet
the
murderous
ruffian
Oliver
Cromwell
,
we
should
have
shake
off
the
English
for
ever
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
Barry
in
the
field
against
the
usurper
;
on
the
contrary
,
my
ancestor
,
Simon
de
Bary
,
come
over
with
the
first
-
name
monarch
,
and
marry
the
daughter
of
the
then
King
of
Munster
,
whose
son
in
battle
he
pitilessly
slay
.
  
<EOS>
in
Oliver
's
time
it
be
too
late
for
a
chief
of
the
name
of
Barry
to
lift
up
his
war
-
cry
against
that
of
the
murderous
brewer
.
<EOS>
We
be
prince
of
the
land
no
longer
;
our
unhappy
race
have
lose
its
possession
a
century
previously
,
and
by
the
most
shameful
treason
.
<EOS>
this
I
know
to
be
the
fact
,
for
my
mother
have
often
tell
me
the
story
,
and
besides
have
work
it
in
a
worsted
pedigree
which
hang
up
in
the
yellow
saloon
at
Barryville
where
we
live
.
  
<EOS>
that
very
estate
which
the
Lyndons
now
possess
in
Ireland
be
once
the
property
of
my
race
.
<EOS>
Rory
Barry
of
Barryogue
own
it
in
Elizabeth
's
time
,
and
half
Munster
beside
.
<EOS>
the
Barry
be
always
in
feud
with
the
O'Mahonys
in
those
time
;
and
,
as
it
happen
,
a
certain
english
colonel
pass
through
the
former
's
country
with
a
body
of
man
-
at
-
arm
,
on
the
very
day
when
the
O'Mahonys
have
make
an
inroad
upon
our
territory
,
and
carry
off
a
frightful
plunder
of
our
flock
and
herd
.
  
<EOS>
this
young
Englishman
,
whose
name
be
Roger
Lyndon
,
Linden
,
or
Lyndaine
,
have
be
most
hospitably
receive
by
the
Barry
,
and
find
him
just
on
the
point
of
carry
an
inroad
into
the
O'Mahonys
'
land
,
offer
the
aid
of
himself
and
his
lance
,
and
behave
himself
so
well
,
as
it
appear
,
that
the
O'Mahonys
be
entirely
overcome
,
all
the
Barrys
'
property
restore
,
and
with
it
,
say
the
old
chronicle
,
twice
as
much
of
the
O'Mahonys
'
good
and
cattle
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
the
setting
in
of
the
winter
season
,
and
the
young
soldier
be
press
by
the
Barry
not
to
quit
his
house
of
Barryogue
,
and
remain
there
during
several
month

his
man
be
quarter
with
Barry
's
own
gallowglasse

man
in
the
cottage
round
about
.
<EOS>
They
conduct
themselves
,
as
be
their
will
not
,
with
the
most
intolerable
insolence
towards
the
irish
;
so
much
so
,
that
fight
and
murder
continually
ensue
,
and
the
people
vow
to
destroy
them
.
  
<EOS>
the
Barry
's
son
(
from
whom
I
descend
)
be
as
hostile
to
the
English
as
any
other
man
on
his
domain
;
and
,
as
they
would
not
go
when
bidden
,
he
and
his
friend
consult
together
and
determine
on
destroy
these
English
to
a
man
.
  
<EOS>
but
they
have
let
a
woman
into
their
plot
,
and
this
be
the
Barry
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
She
be
in
love
with
the
English
Lyndon
,
and
break
the
whole
secret
to
him
;
and
the
dastardly
English
prevent
the
just
massacre
of
themselves
by
fall
on
the
irish
,
and
destroy
Phaudrig
Barry
,
my
ancestor
,
and
many
hundred
of
his
man
.
<EOS>
the
cross
at
Barrycross
near
Carrignadihioul
be
the
spot
where
the
odious
butchery
take
place
.
  
<EOS>
Lyndon
marry
the
daughter
of
Roderick
Barry
,
and
claim
the
estate
which
he
leave
:
and
though
the
descendant
of
phaudrig
be
alive
,
as
indeed
they
be
in
my
person,[footnote
:
as
we
have
never
be
able
to
find
proof
of
the
marriage
of
my
ancestor
Phaudrig
with
his

,
I
make
no

that
Lyndon
destroy
the
contract
,

murder
the
priest

the
marriage

on
appeal
to
the
English
court
<EOS>
,
the
estate
be
award
to
the
Englishman
,
as
have
ever
be
the
case
where
English
and
Irish
be
concern

<EOS>
thus
,
have
it
not
be
for
the
weakness
of
a

I
should
have
be

the
possession

those

afterwards
come

me
by
merit
,
as
you
shall
hear

<EOS>
but
to
proceed
with
my
family
,
history
.
  
<EOS>
My
father
be
well
known
to
the
good
circle
in
this
kingdom
,
as
in
that
of
Ireland
,
under
the
name
of
Roaring
Harry
Barry
.
<EOS>
He
be
breed
like
many
other
young
son
of
genteel
family
to
the
profession
of
the
law
,
be
article
to
a
celebrated
attorney
of
Sackville
Street
in
the
city
of
Dublin
;
and
,
from
his
great
genius
and
aptitude
for
learning
,
there
be
no
doubt
he
would
have
make
an
eminent
figure
in
his
profession
,
have
not
his
social
quality
,
love
of
field
-
sport
,
and
extraordinary
grace
of
manner
,
mark
him
out
for
a
high
sphere
.
<EOS>
while
he
be
attorney
's
clerk
he
keep
seven
race

and
hunt
regularly
both
with
the
Kildare

and
ride
on
his
grey
horse
endymion
that
famous
match
against
Captain
Punter
,
which
be
still
remember
by
lover
of
the
sport
,
and
of
which
I
cause
a
splendid
picture
to
be
make
and
hang
over
my
dining

hall
mantelpiece
at
Castle
Lyndon
.
<EOS>
a
year
afterwards
he
have
the
honour
of
ride
that
very
horse
endymion
before
his
late
Majesty
King
George
II
.
<EOS>
at
new

market
,
and
win
the
plate
there
and
the
attention
of
the
august
sovereign
.
  
<EOS>
although
he
be
only
the
second
son
of
our
family
,
my
dear
father
come
naturally
into
the
estate
(
now
miserably
reduce
to
L400
a

)
;
for
my
grandfather
's
eld
son
Cornelius
Barry
(
call
the
Chevalier
Borgne
,
from
a
wound
which
he
receive
in
Germany
)
remain
constant
to
the
old
religion
in
which
our
family
be
educate
,
and
not
only
serve
abroad
with
credit
,
but
against
His
most
sacred
Majesty
George

in
the
unhappy
Scotch
disturbance
in
'
45

<EOS>
We
shall
hear
more
of
the
Chevalier
hereafter

<EOS>
for
the
conversion
of
my
father
I
have
to
thank
my

Miss
Bell

<EOS>
see
her
at

my
father
become
passionately
attach
to
her
;
but
her
soul
be
above
marry
a
Papist
or
an

clerk
;
and
so
,
for
the
love
of
her
,
the
good
old
law
be
then
in
force
,
my
dear
father
slip
into
my
uncle
Cornelius
's
shoe
and
take
the
family
estate
.
<EOS>
besides
the
force
of
my
mother
's
bright
eye
,
several
person
,
and
of
the
genteel
society
too
,
contribute
to
this
happy
change
;
and
I
have
often
hear
my
mother
laughingly
tell
the
story
of
my
father
's
recantation
,
which
be
solemnly
pronounce
at

300
piece

and
lay
the
necessary
information
the

;
but
his
conversion
cause
a
coolness
between
him
and
my

who
join
the
rebel

<EOS>
this
great
difficulty
be
settle

lend
my

then
lie
at

Pigeon

and
the
handsome
Bell
Brady

induce
to
run
away

him
to
England

although
her
parent
be
against

and
her
lover
(
as
I
have
hear
her
tell
many
thousand
of

be
among
the
most
numerous
and
the
most
wealthy
in
all

They
be

Harry

take
possession

support
our
illustrious

He

no

<EOS>
at

,
after
his
great
day
of
triumph
before
His
Sacred
Majesty
at
Newmarket
,
Harry

fortune
be
just
on

peace
be

He
be
not
faultless

I
do
not
know
whether
His

this
sudden
demise
of
my

my

say
he
shed
some
royal

the
occasion

but
they
help
us
to
nothing
:
and
all
that
be
find
in
the
house
for

creditor
be
a
purse

ninety
guinea

which
my

naturally
take

with
the

and
put
them
into
our
great

drive
off

<EOS>
My

many
a

and
erect
a
monument
over
his

for

I
subsequently

which
declare
him
to
be
the

although
they
do
not

arm
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Barry
do
not
,
perhaps
wisely
,
at
first
make
known
to
her
friend
what
be
her
condition
;
but
arrive
in
a
huge
gilt
coach
with
enormous
armorial
bearing
,
be
take
by
her
sister
-
in
-
law
and
the
rest
of
the
county
for
a
person
of
considerable
property
and
distinction
.
<EOS>
for
a
time
,
then
,
and
as
be
right
and
proper
,
Mrs.
Barry
give
the
law
at
Castle
Brady
.
<EOS>
She
order
the
servant
to
and
fro
,
and
teach
them
,
what
indeed
they
much
want
,
a
little
London
neatness
;
and
"
English
Redmond
,
"
as
I
be
call
,
be
treat
like
a
little
lord
,
and
have
a
maid
and
a
footman
to
himself
;
and
honest
Mick
pay
their
wage
,
 
which
be
much
more
than
he
be
use
to
do
for
his
own
domestic
,
 
do
all
in
his
power
to
make
his
sister
decently
comfortable
under
her
affliction
.
<EOS>
Mamma
,
in
return
,
determine
that
,
when
her
affair
be
arrange
,
she
would
make
her
kind
brother
a
handsome
allowance
for
her
son
's
maintenance
and
her
own
;
and
promise
to
have
her
handsome
furniture
bring
over
from
Clarges
Street
to
adorn
the
somewhat
dilapidated
room
of
Castle
Brady
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
turn
out
that
the
rascally
landlord
seize
upon
every
chair
and
table
that
ought
by
right
to
have
belong
to
the
widow
.
<EOS>
the
estate
to
which
I
be
heir
be
in
the
hand
of
rapacious
creditor
;
and
the
only
mean
of
subsistence
remain
to
the
widow
and
child
be
a
rent
-
charge
of
L50
upon
my
Lord
Bagwig
's
property
,
who
have
many
turf
-
dealing
with
the
deceased
.
<EOS>
and
so
my
dear
mother
's
liberal
intention
towards
her
brother
be
of
course
never
fulfil
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
confess
,
very
much
to
the
discredit
of
Mrs.
Brady
of
Castle
Brady
,
that
when
her
sister
-
in
-
law
's
poverty
be
thus
make
manifest
,
she
forget
all
the
respect
which
she
have
be
accustom
to
pay
her
,
instantly
turn
my
maid
and
man
-
servant
out
of
door
,
and
tell
Mrs.
Barry
that
she
may
follow
them
as
soon
as
she
choose
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Mick
be
of
a
low
family
,
and
a
sordid
way
of
thinking
;
and
after
about
a
couple
of
year
(
during
which
she
have
save
almost
all
her
little
income
)
<EOS>
the
widow
comply
with
Madam
Brady
's
desire
.
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
,
give
way
to
a
just
though
prudently
dissimulate
resentment
,
she
make
a
vow
that
she
would
never
enter
the
gate
of
Castle
Brady
while
the
lady
of
the
house
remain
alive
within
them
.
  
<EOS>
She
fit
up
her
new
abode
with
much
economy
and
considerable
taste
,
and
never
,
for
all
her
poverty
,
abate
a
jot
of
the
dignity
which
be
her
due
and
which
all
the
neighbourhood
award
to
her
.
<EOS>
how
,
indeed
,
could
they
refuse
respect
to
a
lady
who
have
live
in
London
,
frequent
the
most
fashionable
society
there
,
and
have
be
present
(
as
she
solemnly
declare
)
at
court
?
<EOS>
these
advantage
give
her
a
right
which
seem
to
be
pretty
unsparingly
exercise
in
Ireland
by
those
native
who
have
it
,
 
the
right
of
look
down
with
scorn
upon
all
person
who
have
not
have
the
opportunity
of
quit
the
mother
-
country
and
inhabit
England
for
a
while
.
<EOS>
thus
,
whenever
Madam
Brady
appear
abroad
in
a
new
dress
,
her
sister
-
in
-
law
would
say
,
"
poor
creature
!
<EOS>
how
can
it
be
expect
that
she
should
know
anything
of
the
fashion
?
"
<EOS>
and
though
pleased
to
be
call
the
handsome
widow
,
as
she
be
,
Mrs.
Barry
be
still
better
pleased
to
be
call
the
english
widow
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Brady
,
for
her
part
,
be
not
slow
to
reply
:
she
use
to
say
that
the
defunct
Barry
be
a
bankrupt
and
a
beggar
;
and
as
for
the
fashionable
society
which
he
see
,
he
see
it
from
my
Lord
Bagwig
's
side
-
table
,
whose
flatterer
and
hanger
-
on
he
be
know
to
be
.
<EOS>
regard
Mrs.
Barry
,
the
lady
of
Castle
Brady
would
make
insinuation
still
more
painful
.
<EOS>
however
,
why
should
we
allude
to
these
charge
,
or
rake
up
private
scandal
of
a
hundred
year
old
?
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
reign
of
George
II
that
the
above
-
name
personage
live
and
quarrel
;
good
or
bad
,
handsome
or
ugly
,
rich
or
poor
,
they
be
all
equal
now
;
and
do
not
the
Sunday
paper
and
the
court
of
law
supply
us
every
week
with
more
novel
and
interesting
slander
?
  
<EOS>
at
any
rate
,
it
must
be
allow
that
Mrs.
Barry
,
after
her
husband
's
death
and
her
retirement
,
live
in
such
a
way
as
to
defy
slander
.
<EOS>
for
whereas
Bell
Brady
have
be
the
gay
girl
in
the
whole
county
of
Wexford
,
with
half
the
bachelor
at
her
foot
,
and
plenty
of
smile
and
encouragement
for
every
one
of
them
,
Bell
Barry
adopt
a
dignified
reserve
that
almost
amount
to
pomposity
,
and
be
as
starch
as
any
Quakeress
.
<EOS>
many
a
man
renew
his
offer
to
the
widow
,
who
have
be
smite
by
the
charm
of
the
spinster
;
but
Mrs.
Barry
refuse
all
offer
of
marriage
,
declare
that
she
live
now
for
her
son
only
,
and
for
the
memory
of
her
depart
saint
.
  
<EOS>
"
Saint
forsooth
!
<EOS>
"
say
ill
-
natured
Mrs.
Brady
.
  
<EOS>
"
Harry
Barry
be
as
big
a
sinner
as
ever
be
know
;
and
'
tis
notorious
that
he
and
Bell
hate
each
other
.
<EOS>
if
she
will
not
marry
now
,
depend
on
it
,
the
artful
woman
have
a
husband
in
her
eye
for
all
that
,
and
only
wait
until
Lord
Bagwig
be
a
widower
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
suppose
she
do
,
what
then
?
<EOS>
be
not
the
widow
of
a
Barry
fit
to
marry
with
any
lord
of
England
?
<EOS>
and
be
it
not
always
say
that
a
woman
be
to
restore
the
fortune
of
the
Barry
family
?
<EOS>
if
my
mother
fancy
that
she
be
to
be
that
woman
,
I
think
it
be
a
perfectly
justifiable
notion
on
her
part
;
for
the
Earl
(
my
godfather
)
be
always
most
attentive
to
her
:
<EOS>
I
never
know
how
deeply
this
notion
of
advance
my
interest
in
the
world
have
take
possession
of
mamma
's
mind
,
until
his
lordship
's
marriage
in
the
year
'
57
with
Miss
Goldmore
,
the
indian
nabob
's
rich
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
we
continue
to
reside
at
Barryville
,
and
,
consider
the
smallness
of
our
income
,
keep
up
a
wonderful
state
.
<EOS>
of
the
half
-
dozen
family
that
form
the
congregation
at
Brady
's
Town
,
there
be
not
a
single
person
whose
appearance
be
so
respectable
as
that
of
the
widow
,
who
,
though
she
always
dress
in
mourning
,
in
memory
of
her
deceased
husband
,
take
care
that
her
garment
should
be
make
so
as
to
set
off
her
handsome
person
to
the
great
advantage
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
think
,
spend
six
hour
out
of
every
day
in
the
week
in
cutting
,
trim
,
and
alter
them
to
the
fashion
.
<EOS>
She
have
the
large
of
hoop
and
the
handsome
of
furbelow
,
and
once
a
month
(
under
my
Lord
Bagwig
's
cover
)
would
come
a
letter
from
London
contain
the
new
account
of
the
fashion
there
.
<EOS>
Her
complexion
be
so
brilliant
that
she
have
no
call
to
use
rouge
,
as
be
the
mode
in
those
day
.
<EOS>
no
,
she
leave
red
and
white
,
she
say
(
and
hence
the
reader
may
imagine
how
the
two
lady
hate
each
other
)
to
Madam
Brady
,
whose
yellow
complexion
no
plaster
could
alter
.
<EOS>
in
a
word
,
she
be
so
accomplish
a
beauty
,
that
all
the
woman
in
the
country
take
pattern
by
her
,
and
the
young
fellow
from
ten
mile
round
would
ride
over
to
Castle
Brady
church
to
have
the
sight
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
but
if
(
like
every
other
woman
that
ever
I
see
or
read
of
)
<EOS>
she
be
proud
of
her
beauty
,
to
do
her
justice
<EOS>
she
be
still
more
proud
of
her
son
,
and
have
say
a
thousand
time
to
me
that
I
be
the
handsome
young
fellow
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
matter
of
taste
.
<EOS>
a
man
of
sixty
may
,
however
,
say
what
he
be
at
fourteen
without
much
vanity
,
and
I
must
say
I
think
there
be
some
cause
for
my
mother
's
opinion
.
<EOS>
the
good
soul
's
pleasure
be
to
dress
me
;
and
on
Sundays
and
holiday
I
turn
out
in
a
velvet
coat
with
a
silver
-
hilted
sword
by
my
side
and
a
gold
garter
at
my
knee
,
as
fine
as
any
lord
in
the
land
.
<EOS>
My
mother
work
me
several
most
splendid
waistcoat
,
and
I
have
plenty
of
lace
for
my
ruffle
,
and
a
fresh
riband
to
my
hair
,
and
as
we
walk
to
church
on
Sundays
,
even
envious
Mrs.
Brady
be
find
to
allow
that
there
be
not
a
pretty
pair
in
the
kingdom
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
,
too
,
the
lady
of
Castle
Brady
use
to
sneer
,
because
on
these
occasion
a
certain
Tim
,
who
use
to
be
call
my
valet
,
follow
me
and
my
mother
to
church
,
carry
a
huge
prayer
-
book
and
a
cane
,
and
dress
in
the
livery
of
one
of
our
own
fine
footman
from
Clarges
Street
,
which
,
as
Tim
be
a
bandy
-
shanked
little
fellow
,
do
not
exactly
become
him
.
<EOS>
but
,
though
poor
,
we
be
gentlefolk
,
and
not
to
be
sneer
out
of
these
become
appendage
to
our
rank
;
and
so
would
march
up
the
aisle
to
our
pew
with
as
much
state
and
gravity
as
the
Lord
Lieutenant
's
lady
and
son
may
do
.
<EOS>
when
there
,
my
mother
would
give
the
response
and
amen
in
a
loud
dignified
voice
that
be
delightful
to
hear
,
and
,
besides
,
have
a
fine
loud
voice
for
singing
,
which
art
she
have
perfect
in
London
under
a
fashionable
teacher
;
and
she
would
exercise
her
talent
in
such
a
way
that
you
would
hardly
hear
any
other
voice
of
the
little
congregation
which
choose
to
join
in
the
psalm
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
my
mother
have
great
gift
in
every
way
,
and
believe
herself
to
be
one
of
the
most
beautiful
,
accomplished
,
and
meritorious
person
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
often
and
often
have
she
talk
to
me
and
the
neighbour
regard
her
own
humility
and
piety
,
point
them
out
in
such
a
way
that
I
would
defy
the
most
obstinate
to
disbelieve
her
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
leave
Castle
Brady
we
come
to
occupy
a
house
in
Brady
's
town
,
which
mamma
christen
Barryville
.
<EOS>
I
confess
it
be
<EOS>
but
a
small
place
,
<EOS>
but
,
indeed
,
we
make
the
most
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
mention
the
family
pedigree
which
hang
up
in
the
drawingroom
,
which
mamma
call
the
yellow
saloon
,
and
my
bedroom
be
call
the
pink
bedroom
,
and
her
the
orange
tawny
apartment
(
how
well
I
remember
them
all
!
)
;
and
at
dinner
-
time
Tim
regularly
ring
a
great
bell
,
and
we
each
have
a
silver
tankard
to
drink
from
,
and
mother
boast
with
justice
that
I
have
as
good
a
bottle
of
claret
by
my
side
as
any
squire
of
the
land
.
<EOS>
so
indeed
I
have
,
but
I
be
not
,
of
course
,
allow
at
my
tender
year
to
drink
any
of
the
wine
;
which
thus
attain
a
considerable
age
,
even
in
the
decanter
.
  
<EOS>
Uncle
Brady
<EOS>
(
in
spite
of
the
family
quarrel
)
find
out
the
above
fact
one
day
by
call
at
Barryville
at
dinner
-
time
,
and
unluckily
taste
the
liquor
.
<EOS>
You
should
have
see
how
he
sputter
and
make
face
!
<EOS>
but
the
honest
gentleman
be
not
particular
about
his
wine
,
or
the
company
in
which
he
drink
it
.
<EOS>
He
would
get
drunk
,
indeed
,
with
the
parson
or
the
priest
indifferently
;
with
the
latter
,
much
to
my
mother
's
indignation
,
for
,
as
a
true
blue
Nassauite
,
she
heartily
despise
all
those
of
the
old
faith
,
and
would
scarcely
sit
down
in
the
room
with
a
benighted
Papist
.
<EOS>
but
the
squire
have
no
such
scruple
;
he
be
,
indeed
,
one
of
the
easy
,
idlest
,
and
best
-
natured
fellow
that
ever
live
,
and
many
an
hour
would
he
pass
with
the
lonely
widow
when
he
be
tired
of
Madam
Brady
at
home
.
<EOS>
He
like
me
,
he
say
,
as
much
as
one
of
his
own
son
,
and
at
length
,
after
the
widow
have
hold
out
for
a
couple
of
year
,
she
agree
to
allow
me
to
return
to
the
castle
;
though
,
for
herself
,
she
resolutely
keep
the
oath
which
she
have
make
with
regard
to
her
sister
-
in
-
law
.
  
<EOS>
the
very
first
day
I
return
to
Castle
Brady
<EOS>
my
trial
may
be
say
,
in
a
manner
,
to
have
begin
.
<EOS>
My
cousin
,
Master
Mick
,
a
huge
monster
of
nineteen
(
who
hate
me
,
and
I
promise
you
I
return
the
compliment
)
,
insult
me
at
dinner
about
my
mother
's
poverty
,
and
make
all
the
girl
of
the
family
titter
.
<EOS>
so
when
we
go
to
the
stable
,
whither
Mick
always
go
for
his
pipe
of
tobacco
after
dinner
,
I
tell
him
a
piece
of
my
mind
,
and
there
be
a
fight
for
at
least
ten
minute
,
during
which
I
stand
to
him
like
a
man
,
and
black
his
left
eye
,
though
I
be
myself
only
twelve
year
old
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
of
course
he
beat
me
,
but
a
beating
make
only
a
small
impression
on
a
lad
of
that
tender
age
,
as
I
have
prove
many
time
in
battle
with
the
ragged
Brady
's
Town
boy
before
,
not
one
of
whom
,
at
my
time
of
life
,
be
my
match
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
be
very
much
pleased
when
he
hear
of
my
gallantry
;
my
cousin
Nora
bring
brown
paper
and
vinegar
for
my
nose
,
and
I
go
home
that
night
with
a
pint
of
claret
under
my
girdle
,
not
a
little
proud
,
let
me
tell
you
,
at
have
hold
my
own
against
Mick
so
long
.
  
<EOS>
and
though
he
persist
in
his
bad
treatment
of
me
,
and
use
to
cane
me
whenever
I
fall
in
his
way
,
yet
I
be
very
happy
now
at
Castle
Brady
with
the
company
there
,
and
my
cousin
,
or
some
of
them
,
and
the
kindness
of
my
uncle
,
with
whom
I
become
a
prodigious
favourite
.
<EOS>
He
buy
a
colt
for
me
,
and
teach
me
to
ride
.
<EOS>
He
take
me
out
course
and
fowling
,
and
instruct
me
to
shoot
fly
.
<EOS>
and
at
length
I
be
release
from
Mick
's
persecution
,
for
his
brother
,
Master
Ulick
,
return
from
Trinity
College
,
and
hate
his
eld
brother
,
as
be
mostly
the
way
in
family
of
fashion
,
take
me
under
his
protection
;
and
from
that
time
,
as
Ulick
be
a
deal
big
and
strong
than
Mick
,
I
,
English
Redmond
,
as
I
be
call
,
be
leave
alone
;
except
when
the
former
thought
fit
to
thrash
me
,
which
he
do
whenever
he
think
proper
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
my
learning
neglect
in
the
ornamental
part
,
<EOS>
for
I
have
an
uncommon
natural
genius
for
many
thing
,
and
soon
top
in
accomplishment
most
of
the
person
around
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
quick
ear
and
a
fine
voice
,
which
my
mother
cultivate
to
the
good
of
her
power
,
and
she
teach
me
to
step
a
minuet
gravely
and
gracefully
,
and
thus
lay
the
foundation
of
my
future
success
in
life
.
<EOS>
the
common
dance
I
learn
(
as
,
perhaps
,
I
ought
not
to
confess
)
in
the
servant
'
hall
,
which
,
you
may
be
sure
,
be
never
without
a
piper
,
and
where
I
be
consider
unrivalled
both
at
a
hornpipe
and
a
jig
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
matter
of
book
-
learning
,
I
have
always
an
uncommon
taste
for
reading
play
and
novel
,
as
the
good
part
of
a
gentleman
's
polite
education
,
and
never
let
a
pedlar
pass
the
village
,
if
I
have
a
penny
,
without
have
a
ballad
or
two
from
him
.
<EOS>
as
for
your
dull
grammar
,
and
Greek
and
Latin
and
stuff
,
I
have
always
hate
them
from
my
youth
upwards
,
and
say
,
very
unmistakably
,
I
would
have
none
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
this
I
prove
pretty
clearly
at
the
age
of
thirteen
,
when
my
aunt
Biddy
Brady
's
legacy
of
L100
come
in
to
mamma
,
who
think
to
employ
the
sum
on
my
education
,
and
send
me
to
Doctor
Tobias
Tickler
's
famous
academy
at
ballywhacket
 
Backwhacket
,
as
my
uncle
use
to
call
it
.
<EOS>
but
six
week
after
I
have
be
consign
to
his
reverence
,
I
suddenly
make
my
appearance
again
at
Castle
Brady
,
have
walk
forty
mile
from
the
odious
place
,
and
leave
the
Doctor
in
a
state
near
upon
apoplexy
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
that
at
taw
,
prison
-
bar
,
or
box
,
I
be
at
the
head
of
the
school
,
but
could
not
be
bring
to
excel
in
the
classic
;
and
after
have
be
flog
seven
time
,
without
its
do
me
the
least
good
in
my
Latin
,
I
refuse
to
submit
altogether
(
find
it
useless
)
to
an
eighth
application
of
the
rod
.
"
<EOS>
try
some
other
way
,
sir
,
"
say
I
,
when
he
be
for
horse
me
once
more
;
but
he
would
not
;
whereon
,
and
to
defend
myself
,
I
fling
a
slate
at
him
,
and
knock
down
a
Scotch
usher
with
a
leaden
inkstand
.
<EOS>
all
the
lad
huzza'd
at
this
,
and
some
or
the
servant
want
to
stop
me
;
but
take
out
a
large
clasp
-
knife
that
my
cousin
Nora
have
give
me
,
I
swear
I
would
plunge
it
into
the
waistcoat
of
the
first
man
who
dare
to
balk
me
,
and
faith
they
let
me
pass
on
.
<EOS>
I
sleep
that
night
twenty
mile
off
Ballywhacket
,
at
the
house
of
a
cottier
,
who
give
me
potato
and
milk
,
and
to
whom
I
give
a
hundred
guinea
after
,
when
I
come
to
visit
Ireland
in
my
day
of
greatness
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
have
the
money
now
.
<EOS>
but
what
be
the
use
of
regret
?
<EOS>
I
have
have
many
a
hard
bed
than
that
I
shall
sleep
on
to
-
night
,
and
many
a
scanty
meal
than
honest
Phil
Murphy
give
me
on
the
evening
<EOS>
I
run
away
from
school
.
<EOS>
so
six
week
'
be
all
the
schooling
I
ever
get
.
<EOS>
and
I
say
this
to
let
parent
know
the
value
of
it
;
for
though
I
have
meet
more
learn
book
-
worm
in
the
world
,
especially
a
great
hulking
,
clumsy
,
blear
-
eyed
old
doctor
,
whom
they
call
Johnson
,
and
who
live
in
a
court
off
Fleet
Street
,
in
London
,
yet
I
pretty
soon
silence
him
in
an
argument
(
at
"
Button
's
Coffeehouse
"
)
;
and
in
that
,
and
in
poetry
,
and
what
I
call
natural
philosophy
,
or
the
science
of
life
,
and
in
riding
,
music
,
leaping
,
the
small
-
sword
,
the
knowledge
of
a
horse
,
or
a
main
of
cock
,
and
the
manner
of
an
accomplished
gentleman
and
a
man
of
fashion
,
I
may
say
for
myself
that
Redmond
Barry
have
seldom
find
his
equal
.
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
I
to
Mr.
Johnson
,
on
the
occasion
I
allude
to
 
he
be
accompany
by
a
Mr.
Buswell
of
Scotland
,
and
I
be
present
to
the
club
by
a
Mr.
Goldsmith
,
a
countryman
of
my
own
 
"
Sir
,
"
say
I
,
in
reply
to
the
schoolmaster
's
great
thundering
quotation
in
Greek
,
"
<EOS>
you
fancy
you
know
a
great
deal
more
than
me
,
because
you
quote
your
Aristotle
and
your
Pluto
;
but
can
you
tell
me
which
horse
will
win
at
Epsom
down
next
week
?
 
<EOS>
Can
you
run
six
mile
without

<EOS>
Can
you
shoot
the
ace
of
spade
ten
time
without

<EOS>
if
so

talk
about
Aristotle

to
me

<EOS>
roar
out
the
Scotch

,
Mr.

at
this
.
  
<EOS>
"
hold
your
tongue
,
Mr.
Boswell
,
"
say
the
old
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
right
to
brag
of
my
Greek
to
the
gentleman
,
and
he
have
answer
me
very
well

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
doctor
,
"
say
I
,
look
waggishly
at
him
,
"
do
you
know
ever
a
rhyme
for
ArisTOTLE
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
port
,
if
you
plaise
,
"
say
Mr.
Goldsmith
,
laugh
.
<EOS>
and
we
have
six
RHYMES
for
ARISTOTLE
before
we
leave
the
coffee
-
house
that
evening
.
<EOS>
It
become
a
regular
joke
afterwards
when
I
tell
the
story
,
and
at
"
White
's
"
or
the
"
cocoa
-
tree
"
you
would
hear
the
wag
say
,
"
Waiter
,
bring
me
one
of
Captain
Barry
's
rhyme
for
Aristotle
.
"
<EOS>
once
,
when
I
be
in
liquor
at
the
latter
place
,
young
Dick
Sheridan
call
me
a
great
Staggerite
,
a
joke
which
I
could
never
understand
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
wander
from
my
story
,
and
must
get
back
to
home
,
and
dear
old
Ireland
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
make
acquaintance
with
the
good
in
the
land
since
,
and
my
manner
be
such
,
I
have
say
,
as
to
make
me
the
equal
of
them
all
;
and
,
perhaps
,
you
will
wonder
how
a
country
boy
,
as
I
be
,
educate
amongst
irish
squire
,
and
their
dependant
of
the
stable
and
farm
,
should
arrive
at
possess
such
elegant
manner
as
I
be
indisputably
allow
to
have
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
the
fact
be
,
a
very
valuable
instructor
in
the
person
of
an
old
gamekeeper
,
who
have
serve
the
french
king
at
Fontenoy
,
and
who
teach
me
the
dance
and
custom
,
and
a
smattering
of
the
language
of
that
country
,
with
the
use
of
the
sword
,
both
small
and
broad
.
<EOS>
many
and
many
a
long
mile
<EOS>
I
have
trudge
by
his
side
as
a
lad
,
he
tell
me
wonderful
story
of
the
french
king
,
and
the
irish
brigade
,
and
Marshal
Saxe
,
and
the
opera
-
dancer
;
he
know
my
uncle
,
too
,
the
Chevalier
Borgne
,
and
indeed
have
a
thousand
accomplishment
which
he
teach
me
in
secret
.
<EOS>
I
never
know
a
man
like
him
for
make
or
throw
a
fly
,
for
physic
a
horse
,
or
break
,
or
choose
one
;
he
teach
me
manly
sport
,
from
birds"-nesting
upwards
,
and
I
always
shall
consider
Phil
Purcell
as
the
very
good
tutor
I
could
have
have
.
<EOS>
His
fault
be
drink
,
but
for
that
I
have
always
have
a
blind
eye
;
and
he
hate
my
cousin
Mick
like
poison
;
but
I
could
excuse
him
that
too
.
  
<EOS>
with
Phil
,
and
at
the
age
of
fifteen
,
I
be
a
more
accomplished
man
than
either
of
my
cousin
;
and
I
think
Nature
have
be
also
more
bountiful
to
me
in
the
matter
of
person
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
Castle
Brady
girl
(
as
you
shall
hear
presently
)
adore
me
.
<EOS>
at
fair
and
race
many
of
the
prettiest
lass
present
say
they
would
like
to
have
me
for
their
bachelor
;
and
yet
somehow
,
it
must
be
confess
,
I
be
not
popular
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
first
place
,
every
one
know
I
be
bitter
poor
;
and
I
think
,
perhaps
,
it
be
my
good
mother
's
fault
that
I
be
bitter
proud
too
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
habit
of
boast
in
company
of
my
birth
,
and
the
splendour
of
my
carriage
,
garden
,
cellar
,
and
domestic
,
and
this
before
people
who
be
perfectly
aware
of
my
real
circumstance
.
<EOS>
if
it
be
boy
,
and
they
venture
to
sneer
,
I
would
beat
them
,
or
die
for
it
;
and
many
be
the
time
I
have
be
bring
home
well
-
nigh
kill
by
one
or
more
of
them
,
on
what
,
when
my
mother
ask
me
,
I
would
say
be
"
a
family
quarrel
.
"
<EOS>
"
support
your
name
with
your
blood
,
Reddy
my
boy
,
"
would
that
saint
say
,
with
the
tear
in
her
eye
;
and
so
would
she
herself
have
do
with
her
voice
,
ay
,
and
her
tooth
and
nail
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
at
fifteen
,
there
be
scarce
a
lad
of
twenty
,
for
half
-
a
-
dozen
mile
round
,
that
I
have
not
beat
for
one
cause
or
other
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
vicar
's
two
son
of
Castle
Brady
 
in
course
I
could
not
associate
with
such
beggarly
brat
as
them
,
and
many
a
battle
do
we
have
as
to
who
should
take
the
wall
in
Brady
's
Town
;
there
be
Pat
Lurgan
,
the
blacksmith
's
son
,
who
have
the
well
of
me
four
time
before
we
come
to
the
crowning
fight
,
when
I
overcome
him
;
and
I
could
mention
a
score
more
of
my
deed
of
prowess
in
that
way
,
but
that
fisticuff
fact
be
dull
subject
to
talk
of
,
and
to
discuss
before
high
-
breed
gentleman
and
lady
.
  
<EOS>
however
,
there
be
another
subject
,
lady
,
on
which
I
must
discourse
,
and
that
be
never
out
of
place
.
<EOS>
day
and
night
you
like
to
hear
of
it
:
young
and
old
<EOS>
,
you
dream
and
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
handsome
and
ugly
(
and
,
faith
,
before
fifty
,
I
never
see
such
a
thing
as
a
plain
woman
)
,
it
be
the
subject
next
to
the
heart
of
all
of
you
;
and
I
think
you
guess
my
riddle
without
more
trouble
.
<EOS>
LOVE
!
<EOS>
sure
the
word
be
form
on
purpose
out
of
the
pretty
soft
vowel
and
consonant
in
the
language
,
and
he
or
she
who
do
not
care
to
read
about
it
be
not
worth
a
fig
,
to
my
thinking
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
's
family
consist
of
ten
child
;
who
,
as
be
the
custom
in
such
large
family
,
be
divide
into
two
camp
,
or
party
;
the
one
side
with
their
mamma
,
the
other
take
the
part
of
my
uncle
in
all
the
numerous
quarrel
which
arise
between
that
gentleman
and
his
lady
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Brady
's
faction
be
head
by
Mick
,
the
eld
son
,
who
hate
me
so
,
and
dislike
his
father
for
keep
him
out
of
his
property
:
while
Ulick
,
the
second
brother
,
be
his
father
's
own
boy
;
and
,
in
revenge
,
Master
Mick
be
desperately
afraid
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
mention
the
girl
'
name
;
I
have
plague
enough
with
them
in
after
-
life
,
Heaven
know
;
and
one
of
them
be
the
cause
of
all
my
early
trouble
:
this
be
(
though
to
be
sure
all
her
sister
deny
it
)
<EOS>
the
belle
of
the
family
,
Miss
Honoria
Brady
by
name
.
  
<EOS>
She
say
she
be
only
nineteen
at
the
time
;
but
I
could
read
the
fly
-
leaf
in
the
family
Bible
as
well
as
another
(
it
be
one
of
the
three
book
which
,
with
the
backgammon
-
board
,
form
my
uncle
's
library
)
,
and
know
that
she
be
bear
in
the
year
'
37
,
and
christen
by
Doctor
Swift
,
Dean
of
St.
Patrick
's
,
Dublin
:
<EOS>
hence
she
be
three
-
and
-
twenty
year
old
at
the
time
she
and
I
be
so
much
together
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
come
to
think
about
her
now
,
I
know
she
never
could
have
be
handsome
;
for
her
figure
be
rather
of
the
fat
,
and
her
mouth
of
the
wide
;
she
be
freckle
over
like
a
partridge
's
egg
,
and
her
hair
be
the
colour
of
a
certain
vegetable
which
we
eat
with
boil
beef
,
to
use
the
mild
term
.
<EOS>
often
and
often
would
my
dear
mother
make
these
remark
concern
her
;
but
I
do
not
believe
them
then
,
and
somehow
have
get
to
think
Honoria
an
angelical
being
,
far
above
all
the
other
angel
of
her
sex
.
  
<EOS>
and
as
we
know
very
well
that
a
lady
who
be
skilled
in
dancing
or
singing
never
can
perfect
herself
without
a
deal
of
study
in
private
,
and
that
the
song
or
the
minuet
which
be
perform
with
so
much
graceful
ease
in
the
assembly
-
room
have
not
be
acquire
without
vast
labour
and
perseverance
in
private
;
so
it
be
with
the
dear
creature
who
be
skilled
in
coquetting
.
<EOS>
Honoria
,
for
instance
,
be
always
practise
,
and
she
would
take
poor
me
to
rehearse
her
accomplishment
upon
;
or
the
exciseman
,
when
he
come
his
round
,
or
the
steward
,
or
the
poor
curate
,
or
the
young
apothecary
's
lad
from
Brady
's
Town
:
whom
I
recollect
beat
once
for
that
very
reason
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
alive
now
I
make
him
my
apology
.
<EOS>
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
as
if
it
be
his
fault
that
he
should
be
a
victim
to
the
wile
of
one
of
the
great
coquette
(
consider
her
obscure
life
and
rustic
breeding
)
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
if
the
truth
must
be
tell
 
and
every
word
of
this
narrative
of
my
life
be
of
the
most
sacred
veracity
 
<EOS>
my
passion
for
Nora
begin
in
a
very
vulgar
and
unromantic
way
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
save
her
life
;
on
the
contrary
,
I
once
very
nearly
kill
her
,
as
you
shall
hear
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
behold
her
by
moonlight
play
on
the
guitar
,
or
rescue
her
from
the
hand
of
ruffian
,
as
Alfonso
do
lindamira
in
the
novel
;
but
one
day
,
after
dinner
at
Brady
's
Town
,
in
summer
,
go
into
the
garden
to
pull
gooseberry
for
my
dessert
,
and
think
only
of
gooseberry
,
I
pledge
my
honour
<EOS>
,
I
come
upon
Miss
Nora
and
one
of
her
sister
,
with
whom
she
be
friend
at
the
time
,
who
be
both
engage
in
the
very
same
amusement
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
the
Latin
for
gooseberry
,
Redmond
?
"
say
she
.
<EOS>
She
be
always
"
poke
her
fun
,
"
as
the
irish
phrase
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
Latin
for
goose
,
"
say
I.
  
"
<EOS>
and
what
be
that
?
<EOS>
"
cry
Miss
Mysie
,
as
pert
as
a
peacock
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bo
to
you
!
"
<EOS>
say
I
(
for
I
have
never
a
want
of
wit
)
;
and
so
we
fall
to
work
at
the
gooseberry
-
bush
,
laugh
and
talk
as
happy
as
may
be
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
our
diversion
<EOS>
Nora
manage
to
scratch
her
arm
,
and
it
bleed
,
and
she
scream
,
and
it
be
mighty
round
and
white
,
and
I
tie
it
up
,
and
I
believe
be
permit
to
kiss
her
hand
;
and
though
it
be
as
big
and
clumsy
a
hand
as
ever
you
see
,
yet
I
think
the
favour
the
most
ravish
one
that
be
ever
confer
upon
me
,
and
go
home
in
a
rapture
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
much
too
simple
a
fellow
to
disguise
any
sentiment
I
chance
to
feel
in
those
day
;
and
not
one
of
the
eight
Castle
Brady
girl
but
be
soon
aware
of
my
passion
,
and
joke
and
compliment
Nora
about
her
bachelor
.
  
<EOS>
the
torment
of
jealousy
the
cruel
coquette
make
me
endure
be
horrible
.
<EOS>
sometimes
she
would
treat
me
as
a
child
,
sometimes
as
a
man
.
<EOS>
She
would
always
leave
me
if
ever
there
come
a
stranger
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
for
after
all
,
Redmond
,
"
she
would
say
,
"
you
be
but
fifteen
,
and
you
have
not
a
guinea
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
which
I
would
swear
that
I
would
become
the
great
hero
ever
know
out
of
Ireland
,
and
vow
that
before
I
be
twenty
I
would
have
money
enough
to
purchase
an
estate
six
time
as
big
as
Castle
Brady
.
<EOS>
all
which
vain
promise
,
of
course
,
I
do
not
keep
;
but
I
make
no
doubt
they
influence
me
in
my
very
early
life
,
and
cause
me
to
do
those
great
action
for
which
I
have
be
celebrate
,
and
which
shall
be
narrate
presently
in
order
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
tell
one
of
them
,
just
that
my
dear
young
lady
reader
may
know
what
sort
of
a
fellow
Redmond
Barry
be
,
and
what
a
courage
and
undaunted
passion
he
have
.
<EOS>
I
question
whether
any
of
the
jenny
-
jessamine
of
the
present
day
would
do
half
as
much
in
the
face
of
danger
.
  
<EOS>
about
this
time
,
it
must
be
premise
,
the
United
Kingdom
be
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
from
the
threat
generally
credit
of
a
french
invasion
.
<EOS>
the
Pretender
be
say
to
be
in
high
favour
at
Versailles
,
a
descent
upon
Ireland
be
especially
look
to
,
and
the
nobleman
and
people
of
condition
in
that
and
all
other
part
of
the
kingdom
show
their
loyalty
by
raise
regiment
of
horse
and
foot
to
resist
the
invader
.
<EOS>
Brady
's
Town
send
a
company
to
join
the
Kilwangan
regiment
,
of
which
Master
Mick
be
the
captain
;
and
we
have
a
letter
from
Master
Ulick
at
Trinity
College
,
state
that
the
University
have
also
form
a
regiment
,
in
which
he
have
the
honour
to
be
a
corporal
.
<EOS>
how
I
envy
them
both
!
<EOS>
especially
that
odious
Mick
as
I
see
him
in
his
laced
scarlet
coat
,
with
a
ribbon
in
his
hat
,
march
off
at
the
head
of
his
man
.
<EOS>
He
,
the
poor
spiritless
creature
,
be
a
captain
,
and
I
nothing
,
 
I
who
feel
I
have
as
much
courage
as
the
Duke
of
Cumberland
himself
,
and
feel
,
too
,
that
a
red
jacket
would
mightily
become
me
!
<EOS>
My
mother
say
I
be
too
young
to
join
the
new
regiment
;
but
the
fact
be
,
that
it
be
she
herself
who
be
too
poor
,
for
the
cost
of
a
new
uniform
would
have
swallow
up
half
her
year
's
income
,
and
she
would
only
have
her
boy
appear
in
a
way
suitable
to
his
birth
,
ride
the
fine
of
racer
,
dress
in
the
good
of
clothe
,
and
keep
the
genteel
of
company
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
then
,
the
whole
country
be
alive
with
war
's
alarum
,
<EOS>
the
three
kingdom
ring
with
military
music
,
and
every
man
of
merit
pay
his
devoir
at
the
court
of
Bellona
,
whilst
poor
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
stay
at
home
in
my
fustian
jacket
and
sigh
for
fame
in
secret
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mick
come
to
and
fro
from
the
regiment
,
and
bring
numerous
of
his
comrade
with
him
.
<EOS>
Their
costume
and
swaggering
air
fill
me
with
grief
,
and
Miss
Nora
's
unvarye
attention
to
them
serve
to
make
me
half
wild
.
<EOS>
no
one
,
however
,
thought
of
attribute
this
sadness
to
the
young
lady
's
score
,
but
rather
to
my
disappointment
at
not
be
allow
to
join
the
military
profession
.
  
<EOS>
once
the
officer
of
the
Fencibles
give
a
grand
ball
at
Kilwangan
,
to
which
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
all
the
lady
of
Castle
Brady
(
and
a
pretty
ugly
coachful
they
be
)
be
invite
.
<EOS>
I
know
to
what
torture
the
odious
little
flirt
of
a
Nora
would
put
me
with
her
eternal
coquetry
with
the
officer
,
and
refuse
for
a
long
time
to
be
one
of
the
party
to
the
ball
.
<EOS>
but
she
have
a
way
of
conquer
me
,
against
which
all
resistance
of
mine
be
in
vain
.
<EOS>
She
vow
that
ride
in
a
coach
always
make
her
ill
.
"
<EOS>
and
how
can
I
go
to
the
ball
,
"
say
she
,
"
unless
you
take
me
on
Daisy
behind
you
on
the
pillion
?
<EOS>
"
Daisy
be
a
good
blood
-
mare
of
my
uncle
's
,
and
to
such
a
proposition
<EOS>
I
could
not
for
my
soul
say
no
<EOS>
;
so
we
ride
in
safety
to
Kilwangan
,
and
I
feel
myself
as
proud
as
any
prince
when
she
promise
to
dance
a
country
-
dance
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
dance
be
end
,
the
little
ungrateful
flirt
inform
me
that
she
have
quite
forget
her
engagement
;
she
have
actually
dance
the
set
with
an
Englishman
!
<EOS>
I
have
endure
torment
in
my
life
,
but
none
like
that
.
<EOS>
She
try
to
make
up
for
her
neglect
,
but
I
would
not
.
<EOS>
some
of
the
pretty
girl
there
offer
to
console
me
,
for
I
be
the
good
dancer
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
I
make
one
attempt
,
but
be
too
wretched
to
continue
,
and
so
remain
alone
all
night
in
a
state
of
agony
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
play
,
but
I
have
no
money
;
only
the
gold
piece
that
my
mother
bid
me
always
keep
in
my
purse
as
a
gentleman
should
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
for
drink
,
or
know
the
dreadful
comfort
of
it
in
those
day
;
but
I
think
of
kill
myself
and
Nora
,
and
most
certainly
of
make
away
with
Captain
Quin
!
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
and
at
morning
,
the
ball
be
over
.
<EOS>
the
rest
of
our
lady
go
off
in
the
lumber
creak
old
coach
;
Daisy
be
bring
out
,
and
Miss
Nora
take
her
place
behind
me
,
which
I
let
her
do
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
but
we
be
not
half
-
a
-
mile
out
of
town
when
she
begin
to
try
with
her
coaxing
and
blandishment
to
dissipate
my
ill
-
humour
.
  
<EOS>
"
sure
it
be
a
bitter
night
,
Redmond
dear
,
and
you
will
catch
cold
without
a
handkerchief
to
your
neck
.
<EOS>
"
to
this
sympathetic
remark
from
the
pillion
,
the
saddle
make
no
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
and
Miss
Clancy
have
a
pleasant
evening
,
Redmond
?
<EOS>
You
be
together
,
I
see
,
all
night
.
<EOS>
"
to
this
the
saddle
only
reply
by
grind
his
tooth
,
and
give
a
lash
to
Daisy
.
  
<EOS>
"
o
mercy
!
<EOS>
you
will
make
Daisy
rear
and
throw
me
,
<EOS>
you
careless
creature
you
:
<EOS>
and
you
know
,
Redmond
,
I
be
so
timid
.
<EOS>
"
the
pillion
have
by
this
get
her
arm
round
the
saddle
's
waist
,
and
perhaps
give
it
the
gentle
squeeze
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
Miss
Clancy
,
you
know
I
do
!
"
<EOS>
answer
the
saddle
;
"
and
I
only
dance
with
her
because
 
because
 
the
person
with
whom
I
intend
to
dance
choose
to
be
engage
the
whole
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
sure
there
be
my
sister
,
"
say
the
pillion
,
now
laugh
outright
in
the
pride
of
her
conscious
superiority
;
"
and
for
me
,
my
dear
,
I
have
not
be
in
the
room
five
minute
before
I
be
engage
for
every
single
set
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
oblige
to
dance
five
time
with
Captain
Quin
?
"
say
I
;
<EOS>
and
oh
!
<EOS>
strange
delicious
charm
of
coquetry
<EOS>
,
I
do
believe
Miss
Nora
Brady
at
twenty
-
three
year
of
age
feel
a
pang
of
delight
in
think
that
she
have
so
much
power
over
a
guileless
lad
of
fifteen
.
<EOS>
of
course
she
reply
that
she
do
not
care
a
fig
for
Captain
Quin
:
that
he
dance
prettily
,
to
be
sure
,
and
be
a
pleasant
rattle
of
a
man
;
that
he
look
well
in
his
regimental
too
;
and
if
he
choose
to
ask
her
to
dance
,
how
could
she
refuse
him
?
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
refuse
me
,
Nora
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
can
dance
with
you
any
day
,
"
answer
Miss
Nora
,
with
a
toss
of
her
head
;
"
and
to
dance
with
your
cousin
at
a
ball
,
look
as
if
you
could
find
no
other
partner
.
<EOS>
besides
,
"
say
Nora
 
<EOS>
and
this
be
a
cruel
,
unkind
cut
,
which
show
what
a
power
she
have
over
me
,
and
how
mercilessly
she
use
it
,
 
"
<EOS>
besides
,
Redmond
,
Captain
Quin
's
a
man
and
you
be
only
a
boy
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
if
ever
I
meet
him
again
,
"
I
roar
out
with
an
oath
,
"
you
shall
see
which
be
the
good
man
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
I
will
fight
him
with
sword
or
with
pistol
,
captain
as
he
be
.
<EOS>
a
man
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
will
fight
any
man
 
every
man
!
<EOS>
do
not
I
stand
up
to
Mick
Brady
when
I
be
eleven
year
old
?
 
<EOS>
do
not
I
beat
Tom
Sullivan
,
the
great
hulking
brute
,
who
be
nineteen
?
 
<EOS>
do
not
I
do
for
the
Scotch
usher
?
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
Nora
,
it
be
cruel
of
you
to
sneer
at
me
so
!
"
  
<EOS>
but
Nora
be
in
the
sneer
mood
that
night
,
and
pursue
her
sarcasm
;
she
point
out
that
Captain
Quin
be
already
know
as
a
valiant
soldier
,
famous
as
a
man
of
fashion
in
London
,
and
that
it
be
mighty
well
of
Redmond
to
talk
and
boast
of
beating
usher
and
farmer
'
boy
,
but
to
fight
an
Englishman
be
a
very
different
matter
.
  
<EOS>
then
she
fall
to
talk
of
the
invasion
,
and
of
military
matter
in
general
;
of
King
Frederick
(
who
be
call
,
in
those
day
,
the
protestant
hero
)
,
of
Monsieur
Thurot
and
his
fleet
,
of
Monsieur
Conflans
and
his
squadron
,
of
Minorca
,
how
it
be
attack
,
and
where
it
be
;
we
both
agree
it
must
be
in
America
,
and
hope
the
French
may
be
soundly
beat
there
.
  
<EOS>
I
sigh
after
a
while
(
for
I
be
begin
to
melt
)
,
and
say
how
much
I
long
to
be
a
soldier
;
on
which
Nora
recur
to
her
infallible
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
now
,
would
you
leave
me
,
then
?
<EOS>
but
,
sure
,
you
be
not
big
enough
for
anything
more
than
a
little
drummer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
to
which
I
reply
,
by
swear
that
a
soldier
I
would
be
,
and
a
general
too
.
  
<EOS>
as
we
be
chatter
in
this
silly
way
,
we
come
to
a
place
that
have
ever
since
go
by
the
name
of
Redmond
's
Leap
Bridge
.
<EOS>
It
be
an
old
high
bridge
,
over
a
stream
sufficiently
deep
and
rocky
,
and
as
the
mare
Daisy
with
her
double
load
be
cross
this
bridge
,
Miss
Nora
,
give
a
loose
to
her
imagination
,
and
still
harp
on
the
military
theme
(
I
would
lay
a
wager
that
she
be
think
of
Captain
Quin
)
 
<EOS>
Miss
Nora
say
,
"
suppose
now
,
Redmond
,
you
,
who
be
such
a
hero
,
be
pass
over
the
bridge
,
and
the
inimy
on
the
other
side
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
draw
my
sword
,
and
cut
my
way
through
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
,
with
me
on
the
pillion
?
<EOS>
Would
you
kill
poor
me
?
"
<EOS>
(
this
young
lady
be
perpetually
speak
of
"
poor
me
!
"
<EOS>
)
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
then
,
I
will
tell
you
what
I
would
do
.
<EOS>
I
would
jump
Daisy
into
the
river
,
and
swim
you
both
across
,
where
no
enemy
could
follow
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
jump
twenty
foot
!
<EOS>
you
would
not
dare
to
do
any
such
thing
on
Daisy
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
Captain
's
horse
,
Black
George
<EOS>
,
I
have
hear
say
that
Captain
Qui
 
"
  
<EOS>
She
never
finish
the
word
,
for
,
madden
by
the
continual
recurrence
of
that
odious
monosyllable
,
I
shout
to
her
to
"
hold
tight
by
my
waist
,
"
and
,
give
Daisy
the
spur
,
in
a
minute
sprang
with
Nora
over
the
parapet
into
the
deep
water
below
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
why
,
now
 
whether
it
be
I
want
to
drown
myself
and
Nora
,
or
to
perform
an
act
that
even
Captain
Quin
should
crane
at
,
or
whether
I
fancy
that
the
enemy
actually
be
in
front
of
us
,
I
can
not
tell
now
;
but
over
I
go
.
<EOS>
the
horse
sink
over
his
head
,
the
girl
scream
as
she
sink
and
scream
as
she
rise
,
and
I
land
her
,
half
fainting
,
on
the
shore
,
where
we
be
soon
find
by
my
uncle
's
people
,
who
return
on
hear
the
scream
.
<EOS>
I
go
home
,
and
be
ill
speedily
of
a
fever
,
which
keep
me
to
my
bed
for
six
week
;
and
I
quit
my
couch
prodigiously
increase
in
stature
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
still
more
violently
in
love
than
I
have
be
even
before
.
<EOS>
at
the
commencement
of
my
illness
,
Miss
Nora
have
be
pretty
constant
in
her
attendance
at
my
bedside
,
forgetting
,
for
the
sake
of
me
,
<EOS>
the
quarrel
between
my
mother
and
her
family
;
which
my
good
mother
be
likewise
pleased
,
in
the
most
christian
manner
,
to
forget
.
<EOS>
and
,
let
me
tell
you
,
it
be
no
small
mark
of
goodness
in
a
woman
of
her
haughty
disposition
,
who
,
as
a
rule
,
never
forgave
anybody
,
for
my
sake
to
give
up
her
hostility
to
Miss
Brady
,
and
to
receive
her
kindly
.
<EOS>
for
,
like
a
mad
boy
as
I
be
,
it
be
Nora
<EOS>
I
be
always
rave
about
and
ask
for
;
I
would
only
accept
medicine
from
her
hand
,
and
would
look
rudely
and
sulkily
upon
the
good
mother
,
who
love
me
better
than
anything
else
in
the
world
,
and
give
up
even
her
favourite
habit
,
and
proper
and
become
jealousy
,
to
make
me
happy
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
get
well
,
I
see
that
Nora
's
visit
become
daily
more
rare
:
"
why
do
not
she
come
?
<EOS>
"
I
would
say
,
peevishly
,
a
dozen
time
in
the
day
;
in
reply
to
which
query
,
Mrs.
Barry
would
be
oblige
to
make
the
good
excuse
she
could
find
,
 
such
as
that
Nora
have
sprain
her
ankle
,
or
that
they
have
quarrel
together
,
or
some
other
answer
to
soothe
me
.
<EOS>
and
many
a
time
have
the
good
soul
leave
me
to
go
and
break
her
heart
in
her
own
room
alone
,
and
come
back
with
a
smile
face
,
so
that
I
should
know
nothing
of
her
mortification
.
<EOS>
nor
,
indeed
,
do
I
take
much
pain
to
ascertain
it
:
nor
should
I
,
I
fear
,
have
be
very
much
touch
<EOS>
even
have
I
discover
it
;
for
the
commencement
of
manhood
,
I
think
,
be
the
period
of
our
extremest
selfishness
.
<EOS>
We
get
such
a
desire
then
to
take
wing
and
leave
the
parent
nest
,
that
no
tear
,
entreaty
,
or
feeling
of
affection
will
counter
-
balance
<EOS>
this
overpower
longing
after
independence
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
be
very
sad
,
that
poor
mother
of
mine
 
<EOS>
Heaven
be
good
to
her
!
 
<EOS>
at
that
period
of
my
life
;
and
have
often
tell
me
since
what
a
pang
of
the
heart
<EOS>
it
be
to
her
to
see
all
her
care
and
affection
of
year
forget
by
me
in
a
minute
,
and
for
the
sake
of
a
little
heartless
jilt
,
who
be
only
play
with
me
while
she
could
get
no
well
suitor
.
<EOS>
for
the
fact
be
,
that
during
the
last
four
week
of
my
illness
,
no
other
than
Captain
Quin
be
stay
at
Castle
Brady
,
and
make
love
to
Miss
Nora
in
form
.
<EOS>
My
mother
do
not
dare
to
break
this
news
to
me
,
and
you
may
be
sure
that
Nora
herself
keep
it
a
secret
<EOS>
:
it
be
only
by
chance
that
I
discover
it
.
  
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
you
how
?
<EOS>
the
minx
have
be
to
see
me
one
day
,
as
I
sit
up
in
my
bed
,
convalescent
;
she
be
in
such
high
spirit
,
and
so
gracious
and
kind
to
me
,
that
my
heart
pour
over
with
joy
and
gladness
,
and
<EOS>
I
have
even
for
my
poor
mother
a
kind
word
and
a
kiss
that
morning
.
<EOS>
I
feel
myself
so
well
that
I
eat
up
a
whole
chicken
,
and
promise
my
uncle
,
who
have
come
to
see
me
,
to
be
ready
against
partridge
-
shooting
,
to
accompany
him
,
as
my
custom
be
.
  
<EOS>
the
next
day
but
one
be
a
Sunday
,
and
I
have
a
project
for
that
day
which
I
determine
to
realise
,
in
spite
of
all
the
doctor
's
and
my
mother
's
injunction
:
which
be
that
I
be
on
no
account
to
leave
the
house
,
for
the
fresh
air
would
be
the
death
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
I
lie
wondrous
quiet
,
compose
a
copy
of
verse
,
the
first
I
ever
make
in
my
life
;
and
I
give
them
here
,
spelt
as
I
spelt
them
in
those
day
when
I
know
no
better
.
<EOS>
and
though
they
be
not
so
polished
and
elegant
as
"
Ardelia
ease
a
love
-
sick
Swain
,
"
and
"
when
Sol
bedeck
the
Daisied
Mead
,
"
and
other
lyrical
effusion
of
mine
which
obtain
me
so
much
reputation
in
after
life
,
I
still
think
them
pretty
good
for
a
humble
lad
of
fifteen
:
    
<EOS>
the
ROSE
of
FLORA
.
  
<EOS>
send
by
a
Young
Gentleman

<EOS>
on
Sunday
,
no
sooner
be
my
mother
go
to
church
,
than
I
summon
Phil
the
valet
,
and
insist
upon
his
produce
my
good
suit
,
in
which
I
array
myself
(
although
I
find
that
I
have
shoot
up
so
in
my
illness
that
the
old
dress
be
wofully
too
small
for
me
)
,
and
,
with
my
notable
copy
of
verse
in
my
hand
,
run
down
towards
Castle
Brady
,
bent
upon
behold
my
beauty
.
<EOS>
the
air
be
so
fresh
and
bright
,
and
the
bird
sing
so
loud
amidst
the
green
tree
,
that
I
feel
more
elated
than
I
have
be
for
month
before
,
and
spring
down
the
avenue
(
my
uncle
have
cut
down
every
stick
of
the
tree
,
by
the
way
)
as
brisk
as
a
young
fawn
.
<EOS>
My
heart
begin
to
thump
as
I
mount
the
grass
-
grow
step
of
the
terrace
,
and
pass
in
by
the
rickety
hall
-
door
.
<EOS>
the
master
and
mistress
be
at
church
,
Mr.
Screw
the
butler
tell
me
(
after
give
a
start
back
at
see
my
altered
appearance
,
and
gaunt
lean
figure
)
,
and
so
be
six
of
the
young
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
Miss
Nora
one
?

"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
no

Miss
Nora

"
say
Mr.
Screw
,
assume
a
very
puzzled
,

yet
know
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
she
?
"
<EOS>
to
this
question
he
answer
,
or
rather
make
believe
to
answer
,
with
usual
irish
ingenuity
,
and
leave
me
to
settle
whether
she
be
go
to
Kilwangan
on
the
pillion
behind
her
brother
,
or
whether
she
and
her
sister
have
go
for
a
walk
,

whether
she
be
ill
in
her
room
;
and
while
I
be
settle
this
query
,
Mr.
Screw
leave
me
abruptly
.
  
<EOS>
I
rush
away
to
the
back
court
,
where
the
Castle
Brady
stable
stand
,
and
there
I
find
a
dragoon
whistle
the
"
Roast
Beef
of
Old
England
,
"
as
he
clean
down
a
cavalry
horse
.
<EOS>
"
whose
horse
,
fellow
,
be
that
?
"
<EOS>
cry
I.
  
<EOS>
"
Feller
,
indeed
!
"
reply
the
Englishman
:
"
the
horse
belong
to
my
captain
,
and
he
be
a
well
FELLER
nor
you
any
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
stop
to
break
his
bone
,
as
I
would
on
another
occasion
,
for
a
horrible
suspicion
<EOS>
have
come
across
me
,
and
I
make
for
the
garden
as
quickly
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
somehow
what
I
should
see
there
.
<EOS>
I
see
Captain
Quin
and
Nora
pace
the
alley
together
.
<EOS>
Her
arm
be
under
his
,
and
the
scoundrel
be
fondle
and
squeeze
the
hand
which
lie
closely
nestle
against
his
odious
waistcoat
.
<EOS>
some
distance
beyond
them
be
Captain
Fagan
of
the
Kilwangan
regiment
,
who
be
pay
court
to
Nora
's
sister
Mysie
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
afraid
of
any
man
or
ghost
;
but
as
I
see
that
sight
my
knee
fall
a
-
tremble
violently
under
me
,
and
such
a
sickness
come
over
me
,
that
I
be
fain
to
sink
down
on
the
grass
by
a
tree
against
which
I
lean
,
and
lose
almost
all
consciousness
for
a
minute
or
two
:
then
I
gather
myself
up
,
and
,
advance
towards
the
couple
on
the
walk
,
loosen
the
blade
of
the
little
silver
-
hilte
hanger
I
always
wear
in
its
scabbard
;
for
I
be
resolve
to
pass
it
through
the
body
of
the
delinquent
,
and
spit
them
like
two
pigeon
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
tell
what
feeling
else
besides
those
of
rage
be
pass
through
my
mind
;
what
bitter
blank
disappointment
,
what
mad
wild
despair
,
what
a
sensation
as
if
the
whole
world
be
tumble
from
under
me
<EOS>
;
I
make
no
doubt
that
my
reader
hath
be
jilt
by
the
lady
many
time
,
and
so
bid
him
recall
his
own
sensation
when
the
shock
first
fall
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
,
Norelia
,
"
say
the
Captain
<EOS>
(
for
it
be
the
fashion
of
those
time
for
lover
to
call
themselves
by
the
most
romantic
name
out
of
novel
)
,
"
except
for
you
and
four
other

I
vow
before
all
the
god

never

<EOS>
"
ah

she
(
the
beast
's

be
John

,
"
your
passion
be
not
equal
to
ours

be
like
 
like
some
plant
I
have
read
of
 
we
bear
but
one
flower

then
we
die

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
mean
you
never
feel
an
inclination
for
another

Captain
Quin

<EOS>
"
never

my
Eugenio

for
thee
!
<EOS>
how
can
you
ask
a
blush
nymph
such
a
question
?

<EOS>
"
Darling
Norelia
!
"
say
he
,
raise
her
hand
to
his
lip
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
knot
of
cherry
-
coloured
riband
,
which
she
have
give
me
out
of
her
breast
,
and
which
<EOS>
somehow
I
always
wear
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
pull
these
out
of
my
bosom
,
and
fling
them
in
Captain
Quin
's
face
,
and
rush
out
with
my
little
sword
draw
,
shriek
,
"
She
be
a
liar

a
liar

Captain
Quin
!
<EOS>
Draw
,
sir
,
and
defend
yourself
,
if
you
be
a
man

"
<EOS>
and
with
these
word
I
leapt
at
the
monster
,
and
collar
him
,
while
Nora
make
the
air
echo
with
her
scream
;
at
the
sound
of
which
the
other
captain
and
Mysie
hasten
up
.
  
<EOS>
although
I
spring
up
like
a
weed
in
my
illness
,
and
be
now
nearly
attain
to
my
full
growth
of
six
foot
,
yet
I
be
but
a
lath
by
the
side
of
the
enormous
english
captain
,
who
have
calf
and
shoulder
such
as
no
chairman
at
Bath
ever
boast
.
<EOS>
He
turn
very
red
,
and
then
exceedingly
pale
at
my
attack
upon
him
,
and
slip
back
and
clutch
at
his
sword
 
when
Nora
,
in
an
agony
of
terror
,
fling
herself
round
him
,
scream
,
"

old

I
reply

I
swear
a
tremendous
oath

that
nee
not

put
down
here

<EOS>
"
the
man
that
marry
Nora
Brady
must
first
kill

you
mind
that

"
  
"
Pooh

turn
away

flog
you

<EOS>
I
will
send
for
Nick
the
huntsman
to
do
it
;

and
so
he
go
off

<EOS>
Captain
Fagan
now
come
up
,
and
take
me
kindly
by
the
hand
,
say
I
be
a
gallant
lad
,
and
he
like
my
spirit
.
"
<EOS>
but
what
Brady
say
be
true
,
"
continue
he
;
"
it
be
a
hard
thing
to
give
a
lad
counsel
who
be
in
such
a
far
-
go
state
as
you
;
but
,
believe
me
<EOS>
,
I
know
the
world
,
and
if
you
will
but
follow
my
advice
,
you
will
not
regret
have
take
it
.
<EOS>
Nora
Brady
have
not
a
penny
;
you
be
not

whit
rich

<EOS>
You
be

fifteen

and
she
be
four
-
and
-
twenty
.
<EOS>
in
ten
year
,
when
you
be
old
enough
to
marry
,
she
will
be
an
old
woman
;
and
,
my
poor
boy
,
do
not
you
see
 
<EOS>
though
it
be
a
hard
matter
to
see
 
that
she
be
a
flirt
,
and
do
not
care
a
pin
for
you
or
Quin
either
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
but
who
in
love
(
or
in
any
other
point
,
for
the
matter
of
that
)
listen
to
advice
?
<EOS>
I
never
do
,
and
I
tell
Captain
Fagan
fairly
,
that
Nora
may
love
me
or
not
as
she
like
,
but
that
Quin
should
fight
me
before
he
marry
her
 
that
I
swear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Faith
,
"
say
Fagan
,
"
I
think
you
be
a
lad
that
be
likely
to
keep
your
word
;
"
and
,
look
hard
at
me
for
a
second
or
two
,
he
walk
away
likewise
,
hum
a
tune
:
and
I
see
he
look
back
at
me
as
he
go
through
the
old
gate
out
of
the
garden
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
go
,
and
I
be
quite
alone
,
I
fling
myself
down
on
the
bench
where
Nora
have
make
believe
to
faint
,
and
have
leave
her
handkerchief
;
and
,
take
it
up
,
hide
my
face
in
it
,
and
burst
into
such
a
passion
of
tear
as
I
would
then
have
have
nobody
see
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
the
crumpled
riband
which
I
have
fling
at
Quin
lie
in
the
walk
,
and
I
sit
there
for
hour
,
as
wretched
as
any
man
in
Ireland
,
I
believe
,
for
the
time
be
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
changeable
world
!
<EOS>
when
we
consider
how
great
our
sorrow
SEEM
,
and
how
small
they
are
;
how
we
think
we
shall
die
of
grief
,
and
how
quickly
we
forget
<EOS>
,
I
think
we
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
ourselves
and
our
fickle
-
heartedness
.
<EOS>
for
,
after
all
,
what
business
have
time
to
bring
us
consolation
?
<EOS>
I
have
not
,
perhaps
,
in
the
course
of
my
multifarious
adventure
and
experience
,
hit
upon
the
right
woman
;
and
have
forget
,
after
a
little
,
every
single
creature
I
adore
;
but
<EOS>
I
think
,
if
I
could
but
have
light
on
the
right
one
,
I
would
have
love
her
for
EVER
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
have
sit
for
some
hour
bemoan
myself
on
the
garden
bench
,
for
it
be
morning
when
I
come
to
Castle
Brady
,
and
the
dinner
-
bell
clang
as
usual
at
three
o'clock
,
which
waken
me
up
from
my
reverie
.
<EOS>
presently
I
gather
up
the
handkerchief
,
and
once
more
take
the
riband
.
<EOS>
as
I
pass
through
the
office
,
I
see
the
Captain
's
saddle
be
still
hang
up
at
the
stable
-
door
,
and
see
his
odious
red
-
coated
brute
of
a
servant
swagger
with
the
scullion
-
girl
and
kitchen
-
people
.
"
<EOS>
the
Englishman
's
still
there
,
Master
Redmond

say
one
of
the
maid
to
me
(
a
sentimental
black
-
eyed
girl

who
wait
on
the
young
lady
)

<EOS>
"
He
be
there
in
the
parlour

with
the
sweetest
fillet
of
vale
;
go
in
,
and
do
not
let
him
browbeat
you
,
Master
Redmond

"
  
<EOS>
and
in
I
go
,
and
take
my
place
at
the
bottom
of
the
big
table
,
as
usual
,
and
my
friend
the
butler
speedily
bring
me
a
cover
.
  
<EOS>
"
hallo
,
Reddy
my

my

up

well

be
right

He
would
better

home
with
his
mother

growl
my
aunt

do
not
mind
her

say
Uncle
Brady
;

it
be
the
cold
goose
she
eat
at
breakfast

not
agree
with
her

<EOS>
take
a
glass
of
spirit
,
Mrs.
Brady
,
to
Redmond
's
health

It
be
evident
he
do
not
know
of
what
have
happen
;
but
Mick
,
who
be
at
dinner
too
,
and
Ulick
,
and
almost
all
the

look
exceedingly
black

Captain

Miss
Nora

who
be
again
by
his

ready

<EOS>
Captain
Fagan
sit
smile
;

I
look
on
as
cold
as
a
stone
.
<EOS>
I
think
the
dinner
would
choke
me
:
but
I
be
determined
to
put
a
good
face
on
it
,
and
when
the
cloth
be
draw
,
fill
my
glass
with
the
rest
;

we
drank
the
King
and
the
Church
,
as
gentleman
should

My
uncle

in
high
good

humour

a
reconciliation
between
the
faithless
girl
and
her
lover
since
they
have
come
into
the
house

<EOS>
I
learn
the
truth
very
soon
.
<EOS>
at
the
third
toast
,
it
be
always
the
custom
for
the
lady
to
withdraw
;
but
my
uncle

,
in

of
the
remonstrance
of
Nora
,
who
say
,
"

I

after
it
,
for
the
next
moment
I

table
,
trip
up
by
Ulick
,
who
hit
me
a
violent
cuff
on

the
general
scream

skurrying
that

when

<EOS>
Ulick
shake
himself
,
sit
down
quietly
,
fill
a
bumper
,
and

I
will
tell

what

Mr.

"
cry
Quin
,
bristle
up
:
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
insult
grossly
in
this
"
OUSE
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
at
all
satisfied
with
these
here
way
of
go
on
.
<EOS>
I
be
an
Englishman
I
be
,
and
a
man
of
property
;

I
 
<EOS>
I
"
 
<EOS>
"
if
you
be
insult
,
and
not
satisfied
,
remember
there
be
two
of
us
,
Quin
,
"
say
Ulick
gruffly
.
<EOS>
on
which
the
Captain
fall
to
wash
his
nose
in
water
,
and
answer
never
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Quin
,
"
say
I
,
in
the
most
dignified
tone
I
could
assume
,
"
may
also
have
satisfaction
any
time
he
please
,
by
call
on
Redmond
Barry
,
Esquire
,
of
Barryville
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
at
which
speech
my
uncle
burst
out
a
-
laughing
(
as
he
do
at
everything
)
;
and
in
this
laugh
,
Captain
Fagan
,
much
to
my
mortification
,
join
.
<EOS>
I
turn
rather
smartly
upon
him
,
however
,
and
bade
him
to
understand
that
as
for
my
cousin
Ulick
,
who
have
be
my
good
friend
through
life
,
I
could
put
up
with
rough
treatment
from
him
;
yet
,
though
I
be
a
boy
,
even
that
sort
of
treatment
I
would
bear
from
him
no
longer
;
and
any
other
person
who
venture
on
the
like
would
find
me
a
man
,
to
their
cost
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Quin
,
"
I
add
,
"
know
that
fact
very
well
;
and
if
he
be
a
man
,
he
will
know
where
to
find
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
now
observe
that
it
be
get
late
,
and
that
my
mother
would
be
anxious
about
me
.
<EOS>
"
one
of
you
have
better
go
home
with
him
,
"
say
he
,
turn
to
his
son
,
"
or
the
lad
may
be
play
more
prank
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
Ulick
say
,
with
a
nod
to
his
brother
,
"
both
of
us
ride
home
with
Quin
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
afraid
of
Freny
's
people
,
"
say
the
Captain
,
with
a
faint
attempt
at
a
laugh
;
"
my
man
be
armed
,
and
so
be
I.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
the
use
of
arm
very
well
,
Quin
,
"
say
Ulick
;
"
and
no
one
can
doubt
your
courage
;
but
Mick
and
I
will
see
you
home
for
all
that
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
you
will
not

Kilwangan

a
good
ten
mile

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
sleep
at
Quin
's
quarter
,
"
reply
Ulick
:
"
WE'RE
go
to
stop
a
WEEK
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
thank
you
,
"
say
Quin
,
very
faint
;
"
it
be
very
kind
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
lonely
,
you

without

"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
yes
,
very
lonely
!
"
say
Quin
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
in
ANOTHER
WEEK
,
my
boy
,
"
say
Ulick
(
and
here
he
whisper
something
in
the
Captain
's
ear
,
in
which
I
think
I
catch
the
word
"
marriage
,
"
"
parson
,
"
and
feel
all
my
fury
return
again
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
as
you

"
whine
out
the
Captain
;
and
the
horse
be
quickly
bring
round
,
and
the
three
gentleman
ride
away
.
  
<EOS>
Fagan
stop
,
and
,
at
my
uncle
's
injunction
,
walk
across
the
old
treeless
park
with
me
.
<EOS>
He
say
that
after
the
quarrel
at
dinner
,
he
think
I
would
scarcely
want
to
see
the
lady
that
night
,
in
which
opinion
I
concur
entirely
;
and
so
we
go
off
without
an
adieu
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
pretty
day
's
work
of
it
you
have
make
,
Master
Redmond
,
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
you
a
friend
to
the
Bradys
,
and
know
your
uncle
to
be
distress
for
money
,
try
and
break
off
a
match
which
will
bring
fifteen
hundred
a
year
into
the
family
?
<EOS>
Quin
have
promise
to
pay
off
the
four
thousand
pound
which
be
bother
your
uncle
so
.
<EOS>
He
take
a
girl
without
a
penny
 
a
girl
with
no
more
beauty
than
yonder
bullock
.
<EOS>
well
,
well
,
do
not
look
furious
;
let
's
say
she
be
handsome
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
accounting
for
taste

a
girl
that
have
be

at
the
head
of
every
man
in
these
part
these
ten
year
past

miss
them
all

and
you
,
as
poor
as
herself
,
a
boy
of
fifteen
 
<EOS>
well
,
sixteen

if
you
insist

a
boy
who
ought

to
your
father

"
and
so
I
be
,

say
I.

<EOS>
and
this
be
the
return
you
make
him
for
his
kindness
!
<EOS>
do
not
he
harbour
you
in
his
house
when
you

an
orphan

have
not
he
give
you
rent

free

now
,
when

be
put
into
order

a
chance
offer
for
his

age
to

You

most
oblige
to
him

It
be
wicked

ungrateful

unnatural

from

I
be
not
afraid

any
man
alive

exclaim
I
(
for
this
latter
part
of
the
Captain
's
argument
have
rather
stagger
me
,
and
I
wish
,
of
course
,
to
turn
it
 
as
one
always
should
when
the
enemy
be

strong

it

so

here
 
look
at
this
riband

I
have
wear
it
in
my
heart
for
six
month
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
it
there
all
the
time
of
the
fever

<EOS>
do
not
Nora
take
it
out
of
her
own
bosom

give
it
me
?

do
not
she

me

Redmond

<EOS>
"
She
be
practise

reply
Mr.

with
a
sneer
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
woman
,
sir
.
<EOS>
give
them
time
,
and
let
nobody
else
come
to
the
house

and
they
will
fall
in
love
with
a
chimney
-
sweep
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
young
lady
in
Fermoy
"
    
"
a
young
lady
in
flame
,
"
roar
I
<EOS>
(
but
I
use
a
still
hot
word
)
.
"
<EOS>
mark
this
;
come
what
will
of
it
,
I
swear
I
will
fight
the
man
who
pretend
to
the
hand
of
Nora
Brady
.
<EOS>
I
will
follow
him
,
if
it
be
into
the
church
,
and
meet
him
there
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
his
blood
,
or
he
shall
have
mine
;
and
this
riband
shall
be
find
dyed
in
it
.
<EOS>
yes
,
and
if
I
kill
him
,
I
will
pin
it
on
his
breast
,
and
then
she
may
go
and
take
back
her
token
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
I
say
because
I
be
very
much
excited
at
the
time
,
and
because
I
have
not
read
novel
and
romantic
play
for
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
Fagan
after
a
pause
,
"
if
it
must
be
,
it
must
.
<EOS>
for
a
young
fellow
,
you
be
the
most
blood
-
thirsty
I
ever
see
.
<EOS>
Quin
be
a
determined
fellow
,
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
take
my
message
to
him
?
"
<EOS>
say
I
,
quite
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
say
Fagan
:
"
your
mother
may
be
on
the
look
-
out
.
<EOS>
here
we
be
,
close
to
Barryville
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
mind
!
<EOS>
not
a
word
to
my
mother
,
"
I
say
;
and
go
into
the
house
swell
with
pride
and
exultation
to
think
that
I
should
have
a
chance
against
the
Englishman
I
hate
so
.
  
<EOS>
Tim
,
my
servant
,
have
come
up
from
Barryville
on
my
mother
's
return
from
church
;
for
the
good
lady
be
rather
alarm
at
my
absence
,
and
anxious
for
my
return
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
see
me
go
in
to
dinner
,
at
the
invitation
of
the
sentimental
lady'
-
maid
;
and
when
he
have
have
his
own
share
of
the
good
thing
in
the
kitchen
,
which
be
always
better
furnish
than
our
at
home
,
have
walk
back
again
to
inform
his
mistress
where
I
be
,
and
,
no
doubt
,
to
tell
her
,
in
his
own
fashion
,
of
all
the
event
that
have
happen
at
Castle
Brady
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
my
precaution
to
secrecy
,
then
,
I
half
suspect
that
my
mother
know
all
,
from
the
manner
in
which
she
embrace
me
on
my
arrival
,
and
receive
our
guest
,
Captain
Fagan
.
<EOS>
the
poor
soul
look
a
little
anxious
and
flushed
,
and
every
now
and
then
gaze
very
hard
in
the
Captain
's
face
;
but
she
say
not
a
word
about
the
quarrel
,
for
she
have
a
noble
spirit
,
and
would
as
lief
have
see
anyone
of
her
kindre
hang
as
shirk
from
the
field
of
honour
.
<EOS>
what
have
become
of
those
gallant
feeling
nowadays
?
<EOS>
sixty
year
ago
a
man
be
a
man
,
in
old
Ireland
,
and
the
sword
that
be
wear
by
his
side
be
at
the
service
of
any
gentleman
's
gizzard
,
upon
the
slight
difference
.
<EOS>
but
the
good
old
time
and
usage
be
fast
fade
away
.
<EOS>
one
scarcely
every
hear
of
a
fair
meeting
now
,
and
the
use
of
those
cowardly
pistol
,
in
place
of
the
honourable
and
manly
weapon
of
gentleman
,
have
introduce
a
deal
of
knavery
into
the
practice
of
duelling
,
that
can
not
be
sufficiently
deplore
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
arrive
at
home
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
be
a
man
in
earnest
,
and
welcome
Captain
Fagan
to
Barryville
,
and
introduce
him
to
my
mother
,
in
a
majestic
and
dignified
way
,
say
the
Captain
must
be
thirsty
after
his
walk
,
and
call
upon
Tim
to
bring
up
a
bottle
of
the
yellow
-
seal
Bordeaux
,
and
cake
and
glass
,
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
Tim
look
at
the
mistress
in
great
wonderment
:
and
the
fact
be
,
that
six
hour
previous
<EOS>
I
would
as
soon
have
think
of
burn
the
house
down
as
call
for
a
bottle
of
claret
on
my
own
account
;
but
I
feel
I
be
a
man
now
,
and
have
a
right
to
command
;
and
my
mother
feel
this
too
,
for
she
turn
to
the
fellow
and
say
,
sharply
,
"
do
not
you
hear
,
you
rascal
,
what
your
master
say
!
<EOS>
go
,
get
the
wine
,
and
the
cake
and
glass
,
directly
.
<EOS>
"
then
(
for
you
may
be
sure
she
do
not
give
Tim
the
key
of
our
little
cellar
)
<EOS>
she
go
and
get
the
liquor
herself
;
and
Tim
bring
it
in
,
on
the
silver
tray
,
in
due
form
.
<EOS>
My
dear
mother
pour
out
the
wine
,
and
drank
the
Captain
welcome
;
but
I
observe
her
hand
shake
very
much
as
she
perform
this
courteous
duty
,
and
the
bottle
go
clink
,
clink
,
against
the
glass
.
<EOS>
when
she
have
taste
her
glass
,
she
say
she
have
a
headache
,
and
would
go
to
bed
;
and
so
I
ask
her
blessing
,
as
become
a
dutiful
son
 
(
the
modern
BLOODS
have
give
up
the
respectful
ceremony
which
distinguish
a
gentleman
in
my
time
)
 
<EOS>
and
she
leave
me
and
Captain
Fagan
to
talk
over
our
important
business
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
"
say
the
Captain
,
"
I
see
now
no
other
way
out
of
the
scrape
than
a
meeting
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
there
be
a
talk
of
it
at
Castle
Brady
,
after
your
attack
upon
Quin
this
afternoon
,
and
he
vow
that
he
would
cut
you
in
piece
:
but
the
tear
and
supplication
of
Miss
Honoria
induce
him
,
though
very
unwillingly
,
to
relent
.
<EOS>
now
,
however
,
matter
have
go
too
far
.
<EOS>
no
officer
,
bear
His
Majesty
's
commission
,
can
receive
a
glass
of
wine
on
his
nose
 
<EOS>
this
claret
of
yours
be
very
good
,
by
the
way
,
and
by
your
leave
we
will
ring
for
another
bottle
 
without
resent
the
affront
.
<EOS>
fight
you
must
;
and
Quin
be
a
huge
strong
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
give
the
well
mark
,
"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
afraid
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
in
faith
,
"
say
the
Captain
,
"
I
believe
you
be
not
;
for
a
lad
,
I
never
see
more
game
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
look
at
that
sword
,
sir
,
"
say
I
,
point
to
an
elegant
silver
-
mount
one
,
in
a
white
shagreen
case
,
that
hang
on
the
mantelpiece
,
under
the
picture
of
my
father
,
Harry
Barry
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
with
that
sword
,
sir
,
that
my
father
pink
Mohawk
O'Driscol
,
in
Dublin
,
in
the
year
1740
;
with
that
sword
,
sir
,
he
meet
Sir
Huddlestone
Fuddlestone
,
the
Hampshire
baronet
,
and
run
him
through
the
neck
.
<EOS>
They
meet
on
horseback
,
with
sword
and
pistol
,
on
Hounslow
Heath
,
as
I
dare
say
you
have
hear
tell
of
,
and
those
be
the
pistol
"
<EOS>
(
they
hang
on
each
side
of
the
picture
)
"
which
the
gallant
Barry
use
.
<EOS>
He
be
quite
in
the
wrong
,
have
insult
Lady
Fuddlestone
,
when
in
liquor
,
at
the
Brentford
assembly
.
<EOS>
but
,
like
a
gentleman
,
he
scorn
to
apologise
,
and
Sir
Huddlestone
receive
a
ball
through
his
hat
,
before
they
engage
with
the
sword
.
<EOS>
I
be
Harry
Barry
's
son
,
sir
,
and
will
act
as
become
my
name
and
my
quality
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
give
me
a
kiss
,
my
dear
boy
,
"
say
Fagan
,
with
tear
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
after
my
own
soul
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
Jack
Fagan
live
you
shall
never
want
a
friend
or
a
second
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
he
be
shoot
six
month
afterwards
,
carry
order
to
my
Lord
George
Sackville
,
at
Minden
,
and
I
lose
thereby
a
kind
friend
.
<EOS>
but
we
do
not
know
what
be
in
store
for
us
,
and
that
night
be
a
merry
one
at
least
.
<EOS>
We
have
a
second
bottle
,
and
a
third
too
<EOS>
(
I
could
hear
the
poor
mother
go
downstairs
for
each
,
but
she
never
come
into
the
parlour
with
them
,
and
send
them
in
by
the
butler
,
Mr.
Tim
)
:
<EOS>
and
we
part
at
length
<EOS>
,
he
engage
to
arrange
matter
with
Mr.
Quin
's
second
that
night
,
and
to
bring
me
news
in
the
morning
as
to
the
place
where
the
meeting
should
take
place
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
think
since
,
how
different
my
fate
may
have
be
,
have
I
not
fall
in
love
with
Nora
at
that
early
age
;
and
have
I
not
fling
the
wine
in
Quin
's
face
,
and
so
bring
on
the
duel
.
<EOS>
I
may
have
settle
down
in
Ireland
but
for
that
(
for
Miss
Quinlan
be
an
heiress
,
within
twenty
mile
of
us
,
and
Peter
Burke
,
of
Kilwangan
,
leave
his
daughter
Judy
L700
a
year
,
and
I
may
have
have
either
of
them
,
<EOS>
have
I
wait
a
few
year
)
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
in
my
fate
to
be
a
wanderer
,
and
that
battle
with
Quin
send
me
on
my
travel
at
a
very
early
age
:
as
you
shall
hear
anon
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
sleep
sounder
in
my
life
,
though
I
wake
a
little
earlier
than
usual
;
and
you
may
be
sure
my
first
thought
be
of
the
event
of
the
day
,
for
which
I
be
fully
prepared
.
<EOS>
I
have
ink
and
pen
in
my
room
 
<EOS>
have
I
not
be
write
those
verse
to
Nora
but
the
day
previous
,
like
a
poor
fond
fool
as
I
be
?
<EOS>
and
now
I
sit
down
and
write
a
couple
of
letter
more
<EOS>
:
they
may
be
the
last
,
think
I
,
that
I
ever
should
write
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
the
first
be
to
my
mother
:

Honoured
Madam

I
write

Quin

I
meet
this
day
in

field

with

and

I
die

it

some

a

despatch

the
curtain
of
her
bedroom
window
be
down
,

they
do
not
move
as
we
mount
and
trot
off
...
<EOS>
but
two
hours
AFTERWARDS
,
you
should
have
see
her
as
she
come
totter
downstairs
,
and
hear
the
scream
which
she
give
as
she
hug
her
boy
to
her
heart
,
quite
unharmed
and
without
a
wound
in
his
body
.
  
<EOS>
what
have
take
place
I
may
as
well
tell
here
.
<EOS>
when
we
get
to
the
ground

Ulick

Mick

and
the
Captain
be
already
there
:
Quin

flame
in
red
regimental
,
as
big
a
monster
as
ever
lead
a
grenadi
company
.
<EOS>
the
party
be
laugh
together
at
some
joke
of
one
or
the
other
:
and
I
must
say
I
think
this
laughter
very
unbecoming
in
my
cousin
,
who
be
meet
,
perhaps
,
to
see
the
death
of
one
of
their
kindre
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
to
spoil
this
sport
,
"
say
I
to
Captain
Fagan
,
in
a
great
rage
,
"
and
trust
to
see
this
sword
of
mine
in
yonder
big
bully
's
body

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
it
be
with
pistol
we
fight

reply
Mr.

<EOS>
"
You
be
no
match

Quin

"
  
<EOS>

I
will
match
any
man
with
the
sword

I.

<EOS>
but
sword
be
to

day
impossible
;
Captain
Quin
be
 
be
lame

<EOS>
He

It

out

the
letter

fling
them
down
on
the

<EOS>
"
there

I

take
her

She
will
know
what
they

all
that

two
lover

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
feel
any
horror
or
fear
,
young
as
I
be
,
in
see
my
enemy
prostrate
before
me
;
for
I
know
that
I
have
meet
and
conquer
him
honourably
in
the
field
,
as
become
a
man
of
my
name
and
blood
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
now
,
in
Heaven
's
name
,
get
the
youngster
out
of
the
way
,
"
say
Mick
.
  
<EOS>
Ulick
say
he
would
ride
with
me
,
and
off
accordingly
we
gallop
,
never
draw
bridle
till
we
come
to
my
mother
's
door
.
<EOS>
when
there
,
Ulick
tell
Tim
to
feed
my
mare
,
as
I
would
have
far
to
ride
that
day
;
and
I
be
in
the
poor
mother
's
arm
in
a
minute
.
  
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
how
great
be
her
pride
and
exultation
when
she
hear
from
Ulick
's
lip
the
account
of
my
behaviour
at
the
duel
.
<EOS>
He
urge
,
however
,
that
I
should
go
into
hiding
for
a
short
time
;
and
it
be
agree
between
them
that
I
should
drop
my
name
of
Barry
,
and
,
take
that
of
Redmond
,
go
to
Dublin
,
and
there
wait
until
matter
be
blow
over
.
<EOS>
this
arrangement
be
not
come
to
without
some
discussion
;
for
why
should
I
not
be
as
safe
at
Barryville
,
she
say
,
as
my
cousin
and
Ulick
at
Castle
Brady
?
 
<EOS>
bailiff
and
dun
never
get
near
them
;
why
should
constable
be
enable
to
come
upon
me
?
<EOS>
but
Ulick
persist
in
the
necessity
of
my
instant
departure
;
in
which
argument
,
as
I
be
anxious
to
see
the
world
,
I
must
confess
<EOS>
,
I
side
with
him
;
and
my
mother
be
bring
to
see
that
in
our
small
house
at
Barryville
,
in
the
midst
of
the
village
,
and
with
the
guard
but
of
a
couple
of
servant
,
escape
would
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
so
the
kind
soul
be
force
to
yield
to
my
cousin
's
entreaty
,
who
promise
her
,
however
,
that
the
affair
would
soon
be
arrange
,
and
that
I
should
be
restore
to
her
.
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
how
little
do
he
know
what
fortune
be
in
store
for
me
!
  
<EOS>
My
dear
mother
have
some
foreboding
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
that
our
separation
be
to
be
a
long
one
;
for
she
tell
me
that
all
night
long
she
have
be
consult
the
card
regard
my
fate
in
the
duel
:
and
that
all
the
sign
betoken
a
separation
;
then
,
take
out
a
stocking
from
her
escritoire
,
the
kind
soul
put
twenty
guinea
in
a
purse
for
me
<EOS>
(
she
have
herself
but
twenty
-
five
)
,
and
make
up
a
little
valise
,
to
be
place
at
the
back
of
my
mare
,
in
which
be
my
clothe
,
linen
,
and
a
silver
dressing
-
case
of
my
father
's
.
<EOS>
She
bid
me
,
too
,
to
keep
the
sword
and
the
pistol
I
have
know
to
use
so
like
a
man
.
<EOS>
She
hurry
my
departure
now
(
though
her
heart
,
I
know
,
be
full
)
,
and
almost
in
half
-
an
-
hour
after
my
arrival
at
home
<EOS>
I
be
once
more
on
the
road
again
,
with
the
wide
world
as
it
be
before
me
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
how
Tim
and
the
cook
cry
at
my
departure
:
and
,
mayhap
,
I
have
a
tear
or
two
myself
in
my
eye
;
but
no
lad
of
sixteen
be
very
sad
who
have
liberty
for
the
first
time
,
and
twenty
guinea
in
his
pocket
:
<EOS>
and
I
ride
away
,
think
,
I
confess
,
not
so
much
of
the
kind
mother
leave
alone
,
and
of
the
home
behind
me
,
as
of
to
-
morrow
,
and
all
the
wonder
it
would
bring
.
   
<EOS>
a
false
start
in
the
GENTEEL
world
 
<EOS>
I
ride
that
night
as
far
as
Carlow
,
where
I
lie
at
the
good
inn
;
and
be
ask
what
be
my
name
by
the
landlord
of
the
house
,
give
it
as
Mr.
Redmond
,
accord
to
my
cousin
's
instruction
,
and
say
I
be
of
the
Redmonds
of
Waterford
county
,
and
be
on
my
road
to
Trinity
College
,
Dublin
,
to
be
educate
there
.
<EOS>
see
my
handsome
appearance
,
silver
-
hike
sword
,
and
well
-
fill
valise
,
my
landlord
make
free
to
send
up
a
jug
of
claret
without
my
asking
;
and
charge
,
you
may
be
sure
,
pretty
handsomely
for
it
in
the
bill
.
<EOS>
no
gentleman
in
those
good
old
day
go
to
bed
without
a
good
share
of
liquor
to
set
him
sleep
,
and
on
this
my
first
day
's
entrance
into
the
world
,
I
make
a
point
to
act
the
fine
gentleman
completely
;
and
,
I
assure
you
,
succeed
in
my
part
to
admiration
.
<EOS>
the
excitement
of
the
event
of
the
day
,
the
quit
my
home
,
the
meeting
with
Captain
Quin
,
be
enough
to
set
my
brain
in
a
whirl
,
without
the
claret
;
which
serve
to
finish
me
completely
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
dream
of
the
death
of
Quin
,
as
some
milksop
,
perhaps
,
would
have
do
;
indeed
,
I
have
never
have
any
of
that
foolish
remorse
consequent
upon
any
of
my
affair
of
honour
:
always
consider
,
from
the
first
,
that
where
a
gentleman
risk
his
own
life
in
manly
combat
,
he
be
a
fool
to
be
ashamed
because
he
win
.
<EOS>
I
sleep
at
Carlow
as
sound
as
man
could
sleep
;
drank
a
tankard
of
small
beer
and
a
toast
to
my
breakfast
;
and
exchange
the
first
of
my
gold
piece
to
settle
the
bill
,
not
forget
to
pay
all
the
servant
liberally
,
and
as
a
gentleman
should
.
<EOS>
I
begin
so
the
first
day
of
my
life
,
and
so
have
continue
.
<EOS>
no
man
have
be
at
great
strait
than
I
,
and
have
bear
more
pinch
poverty
and
hardship
;
but
nobody
can
say
of
me
that
,
if
I
have
a
guinea
,
I
be
not
free
-
handed
with
it
,
and
do
not
spend
it
as
well
as
a
lord
could
do
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
of
the
future
:
think
that
a
man
of
my
person
,
part
,
and
courage
,
could
make
his
way
anywhere
.
<EOS>
besides
,
I
have
twenty
gold
guinea
in
my
pocket
;
a
sum
<EOS>
which
(
although
I
be
mistaken
)
I
calculate
would
last
me
for
four
month
at
least
,
during
which
time
something
would
be
do
towards
the
making
of
my
fortune
.
<EOS>
so
I
ride
on
,
singe
to
myself
,
or
chat
with
the
passer
-
by
;
and
all
the
girl
along
the
road
say
God
save
me
for
a
clever
gentleman
!
<EOS>
as
for
Nora
and
Castle
Brady
,
between
to
-
day
and
yesterday
there
seem
to
be
a
gap
as
of
half
-
a
-
score
of
year
.
<EOS>
I
vow
I
would
never
re
-
enter
the
place
<EOS>
but
as
a
great
man
;
and
I
keep
my
vow
too
,
as
you
shall
hear
in
due
time
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
much
more
liveliness
and
bustle
on
the
king
's
highroad
in
those
time
,
than
in
these
day
of
stage
-
coach
,
which
carry
you
from
one
end
of
the
kingdom
to
another
in
a
few
score
hour
.
<EOS>
the
gentry
ride
their
own
horse
or
drive
in
their
own
coach
,
and
spend
three
day
on
a
journey
which
now
occupy
ten
hour
;
so
that
there
be
no
lack
of
company
for
a
person
travel
towards
Dublin
.
<EOS>
I
make
part
of
the
journey
from
Carlow
towards
Naas
with
a
well
-
armed
gentleman
from
Kilkenny
,
dress
in
green
and
a
gold
cord
,
with
a
patch
on
his
eye
,
and
ride
a
powerful
mare
.
<EOS>
He
ask
me
the
question
of
the
day
,
and
whither
I
be
bind
,
and
whether
my
mother
be
not
afraid
on
account
of
the
highwayman
to
let
one
so
young
as
myself
to
travel
?
<EOS>
but
I
say
,
pull
out
one
of
them
from
a
holster
,
that
I
have
a
pair
of
good
pistol
that
have
already
do
execution
,
and
be
ready
to
do
it
again
;
and
here
,
a
pock
-
mark
man
come
up
,
he
put
spur
into
his
bay
mare
and
leave
me
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
much
more
powerful
animal
than
mine
;
and
,
besides
,
I
do
not
wish
to
fatigue
my
horse
,
wish
to
enter
Dublin
that
night
,
and
in
reputable
condition
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
ride
towards
Kilcullen
,
I
see
a
crowd
of
the
peasant
-
people
assemble
round
a
one
-
horse
chair
,
and
my
friend
in
green
,
as
I
think
,
make
off
half
a
mile
up
the
hill
.
<EOS>
a
footman
be
howl
"
stop
thief
!
"
<EOS>
at
the
top
of
his
voice
;
but
the
country
fellow
be
only
laugh
at
his
distress
,
and
make
all
sort
of
joke
at
the
adventure
which
have
just
befall
.
  
<EOS>
"
sure
you
may
have
keep
him
off
with
your
blunderbush
!
"
say
one
fellow
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh

the
coward

<EOS>
to
let
the
captain
BATE
you
;
and
he
only
one
eye

"
<EOS>
cry
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
next
time
my
Lady
travel
,
she
would
better
lave
you
at
home
!
"
<EOS>
say
a
third
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
this
noise
,
fellow
?
"
<EOS>
say
I
,
ride
up
amongst
them
,
and
,
see
a
lady
in
the
carriage
very
pale
and
frightened
,
give
a
slash
of
my
whip
,
and
bade
the
red
-
shank
ruffian
keep
off
.
<EOS>
"
what
have
happen
,
madam
,
to
annoy
your
ladyship
?
"
I
say
,
pull
off
my
hat
,
and
bring
my
mare
up
in
a
prance
to
the
chair
window
.
  
<EOS>
the
lady
explain
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
wife
of
Captain
Fitzsimons
,
and
be
hasten
to
join
the
captain
at
Dublin
.
<EOS>
Her
chair
have
be
stop
by
a
highway
-
man
:
the
great
oaf
of
a
servant
-
man
have
fall
down
on
his
knee
arm
as
he
be
;
and
though
there
be
thirty
people
in
the
next
field
work
when
the
ruffian
attack
her
,
not
one
of
them
would
help
her
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
wish
the
Captain
,
as
they
call
the
highwayman
,
good
luck
.
  
<EOS>
"
sure
he
be
the
friend
of
the
poor
,
"
say
one
fellow
,
"
and
good
luck
to
him
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
any
business
of
ours
?
"
ask
another
.
<EOS>
and
another
tell
,
grin
,
that
it
be
the
famous
Captain
Freny
,
who
,
have
bribe
the
jury
to
acquit
him
two
day
back
at
Kilkenny
assize
,
have
mount
his
horse
at
the
gaol
door
,
and
the
very
next
day
have
rob
two
barrister
who
be
go
the
circuit
.
  
<EOS>
I
tell
this
pack
of
rascal
to
be
off
to
their
work
,
or
they
should
taste
of
my
thong
,
and
proceed
,
as
well
as
I
could
,
to
comfort
Mrs.
Fitzsimons
under
her
misfortune
.
<EOS>
"
have
she
lose
much
?
"
<EOS>
"
everything
:
her
purse
,
contain
upward
of
a
hundred
guinea
;
her
jewel
,
snuff
-
box
,
watch
,
and
a
pair
of
diamond
shoe
-
buckle
of
the
Captain
's
.
"
<EOS>
these
mishap
I
sincerely
commiserate
;
and
know
her
by
her
accent
to
be
an
Englishwoman
,
deplore
the
difference
that
exist
between
the
two
country
,
and
say
that
in
our
country
(
mean
England
)
such
atrocity
be
unknown
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
too
,
be
an
Englishman
?
"
say
she
,
with
rather
a
tone
of
surprise
.
<EOS>
on
which
I
say
I
be
proud
to
be
such
:
as
,
in
fact
,
I
be
;
and
I
never
know
a
true
Tory
gentleman
of
Ireland
who
do
not
wish
he
could
say
as
much
.
  
<EOS>
I
ride
by
Mrs.
Fitzsimon
's
chair
all
the
way
to
Naas
;
and
,
as
she
have
be
rob
of
her
purse
,
ask
permission
to
lend
her
a
couple
of
piece
to
pay
her
expense
at
the
inn
:
which
sum
<EOS>
she
be
graciously
pleased
to
accept
,
and
be
,
at
the
same
time
,
kind
enough
to
invite
me
to
share
her
dinner
.
<EOS>
to
the
lady
's
question
regard
my
birth
and
parentage
,
I
reply
that
I
be
a
young
gentleman
of
large
fortune
(
this
be
not
true
;
but
what
be
the
use
of
cry
bad
fish
?
<EOS>
my
dear
mother
instruct
me
early
in
this
sort
of
prudence
)
and
good
family
in
the
county
of
Waterford
;
that
I
be
go
to
Dublin
for
my
study
,
and
that
my
mother
allow
me
five
hundred
per
annum
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fitzsimons
be
equally
communicative
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
daughter
of
General
Granby
Somerset
of
Worcestershire
,
of
whom
,
of
course
,
I
have
hear
(
and
though
I
have
not
,
of
course
I
be
too
well
-
breed
to
say
so
)
;
and
have
make
,
as
she
must
confess
,
a
runaway
match
with
Ensign
Fitzgerald
Fitzsimons
.
<EOS>
have
I
be
in
Donegal
?
 
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
that
be
a
pity
.
<EOS>
the
Captain
's
father
possess
a
hundred
thousand
acre
there
,
and
Fitzsimonsburgh
Castle
be
the
fine
mansion
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
Captain
Fitzsimons
be
the
eld
son
;
and
,
though
he
have
quarrel
with
his
father
,
must
inherit
the
vast
property
.
<EOS>
She
go
on
to
tell
me
about
the
ball
at
Dublin
,
the
banquet
at
the
Castle
,
the
horse
-
race
at
the
Phoenix
,
the
ridotto
and
rout
,
until
I
become
quite
eager
to
join
in
those
pleasure
;
and
I
only
feel
grieve
to
think
that
my
position
would
render
secrecy
necessary
,
and
prevent
me
from
be
present
at
the
Court
,
of
which
the
fitzsimonse
be
the
most
elegant
ornament
.
<EOS>
how
different
be
her
lively
rattle
to
that
of
the
vulgar
wench
at
the
Kilwangan
assembly
!
<EOS>
in
every
sentence
she
mention
a
lord
or
a
person
of
quality
.
<EOS>
She
evidently
speak
french
and
italian
,
of
the
former
of
which
language
<EOS>
I
have
say
I
know
a
few
word
;
<EOS>
and
,
as
for
her
english
accent
,
why
,
perhaps
I
be
no
judge
of
that
,
<EOS>
for
,
to
say
the
truth
,
she
be
the
first
real
english
person
I
have
ever
meet
.
<EOS>
She
recommend
me
,
further
,
to
be
very
cautious
with
regard
to
the
company
I
should
meet
at
Dublin
,
where
rogue
and
adventurer
of
all
country
abound
;
and
my
delight
and
gratitude
to
her
may
be
imagine
,
when
,
as
our
conversation
grow
more
intimate
(
as
we
sit
over
our
dessert
)
,
she
kindly
offer
to
accommodate
me
with
lodging
in
her
own
house
,
where
her
fitzsimon
,
she
say
,
would
welcome
with
delight
her
gallant
young
preserver
.
  
<EOS>
"
indeed
,
madam
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
have
preserve
nothing
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
which
be
perfectly
true
;
for
have
I
not
come
up
too
late
after
the
robbery
to
prevent
the
highwayman
from
carry
off
her
money
and
pearl
?
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
sure
,
madam
,
them
be
not
much
,
"
say
Sullivan
,
the
blundering
servant
,
who
have
be
so
frightened
at
Freny
's
approach
,
and
be
wait
on
us
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
do
not
he
return
you
the
thirteenpence
in
copper
,
and
the
watch
,
say
it
be
only
pinch
-
beck
?
"
  
<EOS>
but
his
lady
rebuke
him
for
a
saucy
varlet
,
and
turn
him
out
of
the
room
at
once
,
say
to
me
when
he
have
go
,
"
that
the
fool
do
not
know
what
be
the
meaning
of
a
hundred
-
pound
bill
,
which
be
in
the
pocket
-
book
that
Freny
take
from
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
perhaps
have
I
be
a
little
old
in
the
world
's
experience
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
begin
to
see
that
Madam
Fitzsimons
be
not
the
person
of
fashion
she
pretend
to
be
;
but
,
as
it
be
,
I
take
all
her
story
for
truth
,
and
,
when
the
landlord
bring
the
bill
for
dinner
,
pay
it
with
the
air
of
a
lord
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
she
make
no
motion
to
produce
the
two
piece
I
have
lend
to
her
;
and
so
we
ride
on
slowly
towards
Dublin
,
into
which
city
we
make
our
entrance
at
nightfall
.
<EOS>
the
rattle
and
splendour
of
the
coach
,
the
flare
of
the
linkboy
,
the
number
and
magnificence
of
the
house
,
strike
me
with
the
great
wonder
;
though
I
be
careful
to
disguise
this
feeling
,
accord
to
my
dear
mother
's
direction
,
who
tell
me
that
it
be
the
mark
of
a
man
of
fashion
never
to
wonder
at
anything
,
and
never
to
admit
that
any
house
,
equipage
,
or
company
he
see
,
be
more
splendid
or
genteel
than
what
he
have
be
accustom
to
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
We
stop
,
at
length
,
at
a
house
of
rather
mean
appearance
,
and
be
let
into
a
passage
by
no
means
so
clean
as
that
at
Barryville
,
where
there
be
a
great
smell
of
supper
and
punch
.
<EOS>
a
stout
red
-
faced
man
,
without
a
periwig
,
and
in
rather
a
tattered
nightgown
and
cap
,
make
his
appearance
from
the
parlour
,
and
embrace
his
lady
(
for
it
be
Captain
Fitzsimons
)
with
a
great
deal
of
cordiality
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
when
he
see
that
a
stranger
accompany
her
,
he
embrace
her
more
rapturously
than
ever
.
<EOS>
in
introduce
me
,
she
persist
in
say
that
I
be
her
preserver
,
and
compliment
my
gallantry
as
much
as
if
I
have
kill
Freny
,
instead
of
come
up
when
the
robbery
be
over
.
<EOS>
the
Captain
say
he
know
the
Redmonds
of
Waterford
intimately
well
:
which
assertion
alarm
me
,
as
I
know
nothing
of
the
family
to
which
I
be
state
to
belong
.
<EOS>
but
I
pose
him
,
by
ask
WHICH
of
the
Redmonds
he
know
,
for
I
have
never
hear
his
name
in
our
family
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
know
the
Redmonds
of
Redmondstown
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
"
say
I
,
"
mine
be
the
Redmonds
of
Castle
Redmond
;
"
and
so
I
put
him
off
the
scent
.
<EOS>
I
go
to
see
my
nag
put
up
at
a
livery
-
stable
hard
by
,
with
the
Captain
's
horse
and
chair
,
and
return
to
my
entertainer
.
  
<EOS>
although
there
be
the
relic
of
some
mutton
-
chop
and
onion
on
a
crack
dish
before
him
,
the
Captain
say
,
"
My
love
,
I
wish
I
have
know
of
your
coming
,
for
Bob
Moriarty
<EOS>
and
I
just
finish
the
most
delicious
venison
pasty
,
which
his
grace
the
Lord
Lieutenant
send
us
,
with
a
flask
of
sillery
from
his
own
cellar
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
wine
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
but
as
bygone
be
bygone
,
and
no
help
for
them
,
what
say
ye
to
a
fine
lobster
and
a
bottle
of
as
good
claret
as
any
in
Ireland
?
<EOS>
Betty
,
clear
these
thing
from
the
table
,
and
make
the
mistress
and
our
young
friend
welcome
to
our
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
not
have
small
change
,
Mr.
Fitzsimons
ask
me
to
lend
him
a
tenpenny
-
piece
to
purchase
the
dish
of
lobster
;
but
his
lady
,
hand
out
one
of
the
guinea
I
have
give
her
,
bade
the
girl
get
the
change
for
that
,
and
procure
the
supper
;
which
she
do
presently
,
bring
back
only
a
very
few
shilling
out
of
the
guinea
to
her
mistress
,
say
that
the
fishmonger
have
keep
the
remainder
for
an
old
account
.
"
<EOS>
and
the
more
great
big
blundering
fool
you
,
for
give
the
gold
piece
to
him
,
"
roar
Mr.
Fitzsimons
.
<EOS>
I
forget
how
many
hundred
guinea
<EOS>
he
say
he
have
pay
the
fellow
during
the
year
.
  
<EOS>
Our
supper
be
season
,
if
not
by
any
great
elegance
,
at
least
by
a
plentiful
store
of
anecdote
,
concern
the
high
personage
of
the
city
;
with
whom
,
accord
to
himself
,
the
Captain
live
on
term
of
the
utmost
intimacy
.
<EOS>
not
to
be
behindhand
with
him
,
I
speak
of
my
own
estate
and
property
as
if
I
be
as
rich
as
a
duke
.
<EOS>
I
tell
all
the
story
of
the
nobility
I
have
ever
hear
from
my
mother
,
and
some
that
,
perhaps
,
I
have
invent
;
and
ought
to
have
be
aware
that
my
host
be
an
impostor
himself
,
as
he
do
not
find
out
my
own
blunder
and
misstatement
.
<EOS>
but
youth
be
ever
too
confident
.
<EOS>
It
be
some
time
before
I
know
that
I
have
make
no
very
desirable
acquaintance
in
Captain
Fitzsimons
and
his
lady
;
and
,
indeed
,
go
to
bed
congratulate
myself
upon
my
wonderful
good
luck
in
have
,
at
the
outset
of
my
adventure
,
fall
in
with
<EOS>
so
distinguish
a
couple
.
  
<EOS>
the
appearance
of
the
chamber
I
occupy
may
,
indeed
,
have
lead
me
to
imagine
that
the
heir
of
Fitzsimonsburgh
Castle
,
county
Donegal
,
be
not
as
yet
reconcile
with
his
wealthy
parent
;
and
,
have
I
be
an
English
lad
,
<EOS>
probably
my
suspicion
and
distrust
would
have
be
arouse
instantly
.
<EOS>
but
perhaps
,
as
the
reader
know
,
we
be
not
so
particular
in
Ireland
on
the
score
of
neatness
as
people
be
in
this
precise
country
;
hence
the
disorder
of
my
bedchamber
do
not
strike
me
so
much
.
<EOS>
for
be
not
all
the
window
break
and
stuff
with
rag
even
at
Castle
Brady
,
my
uncle
's
superb
mansion
?
<EOS>
be
there
ever
a
lock
to
the
door
there
,
or
if
a
lock
,
a
handle
to
the
lock
or
a
hasp
to
fasten
it
to
?
<EOS>
so
,
though
my
bedroom
boast
of
these
inconvenience
,
and
a
few
more
;
though
my
counterpane
be
evidently
a
grease
brocade
dress
of
Mrs.
Fitzsimons
's
,
and
my
crack
toilet
-
glass
not
much
big
than
a
half
-
crown
,
yet
I
be
use
to
this
sort
of
way
in
irish
house
,
and
still
think
myself
in
that
of
a
man
of
fashion
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
lock
to
the
drawer
,
which
,
when
they
do
open
,
be
full
of
my
hostess
's
rouge
-
pot
,
shoe
,
stay
,
and
rag
;
so
I
allow
my
wardrobe
to
remain
in
my
valise
,
but
set
out
my
silver
dressing
-
apparatus
upon
the
ragged
cloth
on
the
drawer
,
where
it
shine
to
great
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
when
Sullivan
appear
in
the
morning
,
I
ask
him
about
my
mare
,
which
he
inform
me
be
do
well
.
<EOS>
I
then
bade
him
bring
me
hot
shaving
-
water
,
in
a
loud
dignified
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
hot
shaving
-
water
!
"
say
he
,
burst
out
laugh
(
and
I
confess
not
without
reason
)
.
<EOS>
"
be
it
yourself
you
be
go
to
shave
?
"
say
he
.
"
<EOS>
and
maybe
when
I
bring
you
up
the
water
<EOS>
I
will
bring
you
up
the
cat
too
,
and
you
can
shave
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
fling
a
boot
at
the
scoundrel
's
head
in
reply
to
this
impertinence
,
and
be
soon
with
my
friend
in
the
parlour
for
breakfast
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
hearty
welcome
,
and
the
same
cloth
that
have
be
use
the
night
before
:
as
I
recognise
by
the
black
mark
of
the
irish
-
stew
dish
,
and
the
stain
leave
by
a
pot
of
porter
at
supper
.
  
<EOS>
My
host
greet
me
with
great
cordiality
;
Mrs.
Fitzsimons
say
I
be
an
elegant
figure
for
the
Phoenix
;
and
indeed
,
without
vanity
,
I
may
say
of
myself
that
there
be
bad
-
look
fellow
in
Dublin
than
I.
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
powerful
chest
and
muscular
proportion
which
I
have
since
attain
(
to
be
exchange
,
alas
!
<EOS>
for
gouty
leg
and
chalk
-
stone
in
my
finger
;
but
'
tis
the
way
of
mortality
)
,
but
I
have
arrive
at
near
my
present
growth
of
six
foot
,
and
with
my
hair
in
buckle
,
a
handsome
lace
jabot
and
wristband
to
my
shirt
,
and
a
red
plush
waistcoat
,
bar
with
gold
,
look
the
gentleman
I
be
bear
.
<EOS>
I
wear
my
drab
coat
with
plate
button
,
that
be
grow
too
small
for
me
,
and
quite
agree
with
Captain
Fitzsimons
that
I
must
pay
a
visit
to
his
tailor
,
in
order
to
procure
myself
a
coat
more
fitting
my
size
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
ask
whether
you
have
a
comfortable
bed
,
"
say
he
.
"
<EOS>
Young
Fred
Pimpleton
(
Lord
Pimpleton
's
second
son
)
sleep
in
it
for
seven
month
,
during
which
he
do
me
the
honour
to
stay
with
me
,
and
if
he
be
satisfied
,
I
do
not
know
who
else
would
not
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
after
breakfast
we
walk
out
to
see
the
town
,
and
Mr.
Fitzsimons
introduce
me
to
several
of
his
acquaintance
whom
we
meet
,
as
his
particular
young
friend
Mr.
Redmond
,
of
Waterford
county
;
he
also
present
me
at
his
hatter
's
and
tailor
be
as
a
gentleman
of
great
expectation
and
large
property
;
and
although
I
tell
the
latter
that
I
should
not
pay
him
ready
cash
for
more
than
one
coat
,
which
fit
me
to
a
nicety
,
yet
he
insist
upon
make
me
several
,
which
I
do
not
care
to
refuse
.
<EOS>
the
Captain
,
also
,
who
certainly
want
such
a
renewal
of
raiment
,
tell
the
tailor
to
send
him
home
a
handsome
military
frock
,
which
he
select
.
  
<EOS>
then
we
go
home
to
Mrs.
Fitzsimons
,
who
drive
out
in
her
chair
to
the
Phoenix
Park
,
where
a
review
be
,
and
where
number
of
the
young
gentry
be
round
about
her
;
to
all
of
whom
she
present
me
as
her
preserver
of
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
such
be
her
complimentary
account
of
me
,
that
before
half
-
an
-
hour
I
have
get
to
be
consider
as
a
young
gentleman
of
the
high
family
in
the
land
,
relate
to
all
the
principal
nobility
,
a
cousin
of
Captain
Fitzsimons
,
and
heir
to
L10,000
a
year
.
<EOS>
fitzsimon
say
he
have
ride
over
every
inch
of
my
estate
;
and
"
faith
,
as
he
choose
to
tell
these
story
for
me
<EOS>
,
I
let
him
have
his
way
 
indeed
,
be
not
a
little
pleased
(
as
youth
be
)
to
be
make
much
of
,
and
to
pass
for
a
great
personage
.
<EOS>
I
have
little
notion
then
that
I
have
get
among
a
set
of
impostor
 
that
Captain
Fitzsimons
be
only
an
adventurer
,
and
his
lady
a
person
of
no
credit
;
but
such
be
the
danger
to
which
youth
be
perpetually
subject
,
and
hence
let
young
man
take
warning
by
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
purposely
hurry
over
the
description
of
my
life
in
which
the
incident
be
painful
,
of
no
great
interest
except
to
my
unlucky
self
,
and
of
which
my
companion
be
certainly
not
of
a
kind
befitting
my
quality
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
a
young
man
could
hardly
have
fall
into
bad
hand
than
those
in
which
I
now
find
myself
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
to
Donegal
since
,
and
have
never
see
the
famous
Castle
of
Fitzsimonsburgh
,
which
be
,
likewise
,
unknown
to
the
old
inhabitant
of
that
county
;
nor
be
the
Granby
Somersets
much
better
know
in
Worcestershire
.
<EOS>
the
couple
into
whose
hand
I
have
fall
be
of
a
sort
much
more
common
then
than
at
present
,
for
the
vast
war
of
later
day
have
render
it
very
difficult
for
nobleman
's
footman
or
hanger
-
on
to
procure
commission
;
and
such
,
in
fact
,
have
be
the
original
station
of
Captain
Fitzsimons
.
<EOS>
have
I
know
his
origin
,
of
course
I
would
have
die
rather
than
have
associate
with
him
:
<EOS>
but
in
those
simple
day
of
youth
I
take
his
tale
for
truth
,
and
fancy
myself
in
high
luck
at
be
,
at
my
outset
into
life
,
introduce
into
such
a
family
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
we
be
the
sport
of
destiny
.
<EOS>
when
I
consider
upon
what
small
circumstance
all
the
great
event
of
my
life
have
turn
,
I
can
hardly
believe
myself
to
have
be
anything
but
a
puppet
in
the
hand
of
fate
;
which
have
play
its
most
fantastic
trick
upon
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
Captain
have
be
a
gentleman
's
gentleman
,
and
his
lady
of
no
high
rank
.
<EOS>
the
society
which
this
worthy
pair
keep
be
at
a
sort
of
ordinary
which
they
hold
,
and
at
which
their
friend
be
always
welcome
on
payment
of
a
certain
moderate
sum
for
their
dinner
.
<EOS>
after
dinner
,
you
may
be
sure
that
card
be
not
want
,
and
that
the
company
who
play
do
not
play
for
love
merely
.
<EOS>
to
these
party
person
of
all
sort
would
come
:
young
blood
from
the
regiment
garrison
in
Dublin
:
young
clerk
from
the
Castle
;
horse
-
riding
,
wine
-
tipple
,
watchman
-
beat
man
of
fashion
about
town
,
such
as
exist
in
Dublin
in
that
day
more
than
in
any
other
city
with
which
I
be
acquaint
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
I
never
know
young
fellow
make
such
a
show
,
and
upon
such
small
mean
.
<EOS>
I
never
know
young
gentleman
with
what
I
may
call
such
a
genius
for
idleness
;
and
whereas
an
Englishman
with
fifty
guinea
a
year
be
not
able
to
do
much
more
than
starve
,
and
toil
like
a
slave
in
a
profession
,
a
young
irish
buck
with
the
same
sum
will
keep
his
horse
,
and
drink
his
bottle
,
and
live
as
lazy
as
a
lord
.
<EOS>
here
be
a
doctor
who
never
have
a
patient
,
cheek
by
jowl
with
an
attorney
who
never
have
a
client
:
neither
have
a
guinea
 
each
have
a
good
horse
to
ride
in
the
Park
,
and
the
good
of
clothe
to
his
back
.
<EOS>
a
sport
clergyman
without
a
living
;
several
young
wine
-
merchant
,
who
consume
much
more
liquor
than
they
have
or
sell
;
and
man
of
similar
character
,
form
the
society
at
the
house
into
which
,
by
ill
luck
,
I
be
throw
.
<EOS>
what
could
happen
to
a
man
but
misfortune
from
associate
with
such
company
?
 
<EOS>
(
I
have
not
mention
the
lady
of
the
society
,
who
be
,
perhaps
,
no
well
than
the
male
)
 
and
in
a
very
very
short
time
I
become
their
prey
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
my
poor
twenty
guinea
,
in
three
day
I
see
,
with
terror
,
that
they
have
dwindle
down
to
eight
:
<EOS>
theatre
and
tavern
have
already
make
such
cruel
inroad
in
my
purse
.
<EOS>
at
play
I
have
lose
,
it
be
true
,
a
couple
of
piece
;
but
see
that
every
one
round
about
me
play
upon
honour
and
give
their
bill
,
I
,
of
course
,
prefer
that
medium
to
the
payment
of
ready
money
,
and
when
I
lose
pay
on
account
.
  
<EOS>
with
the
tailor
,
saddler
,
and
other
,
I
employ
similar
mean
;
and
in
so
far
Mr.
Fitzsimons
's
representation
do
me
good
,
for
the
tradesman
take
him
at
his
word
regard
my
fortune
<EOS>
(
I
have
since
learn
that
the
rascal
pigeone
several
other
young
man
of
property
)
,
and
for
a
little
time
supply
me
with
any
good
I
may
be
pleased
to
order
.
<EOS>
at
length
,
my
cash
run
low
,
I
be
compel
to
pawn
some
of
the
suit
with
which
the
tailor
have
provide
me
;
for
I
do
not
like
to
part
with
my
mare
,
on
which
I
daily
ride
in
the
Park
,
and
which
I
love
as
the
gift
of
my
respected
uncle
.
<EOS>
I
raise
some
little
money
,
too
,
on
a
few
trinket
which
I
have
purchase
of
a
jeweller
who
press
his
credit
upon
me
;
and
thus
be
enable
to
keep
up
appearance
for
yet
a
little
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
ask
at
the
post
-
office
repeatedly
for
letter
for
Mr.
Redmond
,
but
none
such
have
arrive
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
always
feel
rather
relieved
when
the
answer
of
"
no
"
be
give
to
me
;
for
I
be
not
very
anxious
that
my
mother
should
know
my
proceeding
in
the
extravagant
life
which
I
be
lead
at
Dublin
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
last
very
long
,
however
;
for
when
my
cash
be
quite
exhausted
,
and
I
pay
a
second
visit
to
the
tailor
,
request
him
to
make
me
more
clothe
,
the
fellow
hum
and
ha'd
,
and
have
the
impudence
to
ask
payment
for
those
already
supply
:
on
which
,
tell
him
I
should
withdraw
my
custom
from
him
,
I
abruptly
leave
him
.
<EOS>
the
goldsmith
too
(
a
rascal
Jew
)
decline
to
let
me
take
a
gold
chain
to
which
I
have
a
fancy
;
and
I
feel
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
in
some
perplexity
.
<EOS>
to
add
to
it
,
one
of
the
young
gentleman
who
frequent
Mr.
Fitzsimons
's
boarding
-
house
have
receive
from
me
,
in
the
way
of
play
,
an
IOU
for
eighteen
pound
(
which
I
lose
to
him
at
piquet
)
,
and
which
,
owe
Mr.
Curbyn
,
the
livery
-
stable
keeper
,
a
bill
,
he
pass
into
that
person
's
hand
.
<EOS>
fancy
my
rage
and
astonishment
,
then
,
on
go
for
my
mare
,
to
find
that
he
positively
refuse
to
let
me
have
her
out
of
the
stable
,
except
under
payment
of
my
promissory
note
!
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
that
I
offer
him
his
choice
of
four
note
that
I
have
in
my
pocket
 
one
of
fitzsimon
's
for
L20
,
one
of
Counsellor
Mulligan
's
,
and
so
forth
;
the
dealer
,
who
be
a
Yorkshireman
,
shake
his
head
,
and
laugh
at
every
one
of
them
;
and
say
,
"
I
tell
you
what
,
Master
Redmond
,
you
appear
a
young
fellow
of
birth
and
fortune
,
and
let
me
whisper
in
your
ear
that
you
have
fall
into
very
bad
hand
 
<EOS>
it
be
a
regular
gang
of
swindler
;
and
a
gentleman
of
your
rank
and
quality
should
never
be
see
in
such
company
.
<EOS>
go
home
:
pack
up
your
valise
,
pay
the
little
trifle
to
me
,
mount
your
mare
,
and
ride
back
again
to
your

very
good
thing
you
can
do

<EOS>
in
a
pretty
nest
of
villain
,
indeed
,
be
I
plunge
!
<EOS>
It
seem
as
if
all
my
misfortune
be
to
break
on
me
at
once
;
for
,
on
go
home
and
ascend
to
my
bedroom
in
a
disconsolate
way

find
the
Captain

his
lady
there
before
me
,
my
valise
open
,
my
wardrobe
lie
on
the
ground
,
and
my
key
in
the
possession
of
the
odious

"

the

<EOS>

I

through

You
come
like
a

innocent

you

yourself

Captain

large

by
preference
,
long

;

I
take
you

<EOS>

I

I
with

<EOS>
"
UNDER
WHAT
name
,
unhappy
boy
 
under
what
name
?
"
scream
Mrs.
Fitzsimons
;
and
then
,
indeed
,
I
remember
that
I
have
sign
the
document
Barry
Redmond
instead
of
Redmond
Barry
:
<EOS>
but
what
else
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
have
not
my
mother
desire
me
to
take
no
other
designation
?
<EOS>
after
utter
a
furious
tirade
against
me
,
in
which
he
speak
of
the
fatal
discovery
of
my
real
name
on
my
linen
 
of
his
misplace
confidence
of
affection
,
and
the
shame
with
which
he
should
be
oblige
to
meet
his
fashionable
friend
and
confess
that
he
have
harbour
a
swindler
,
he
gather
up
the
linen
,
clothe
,
silver
toilet
article
,
and
the
rest
of
my
gear
,
say
that
he
should
step
out
that
moment
for
an
officer
and
give
me
up
to
the
just
revenge
of
the
law
.
  
<EOS>
during
the
first
part
of
his
speech
,
the
thought
of
the
imprudence
of
which
I
have
be
guilty
,
and
the
predicament
in
which
I
be
plunge
,
have
so
puzzle
and
confound
me
,
that
I
have
not
utter
a
word
in
reply
to
the
fellow
's
abuse
,
but
have
stand
quite
dumb
before
him

<EOS>
the
sense
of
danger
,
however
,
at
once
rouse
me
to
action
.
"
<EOS>
Hark
ye

Mr.
Fitzsimons

I

I

and
the
good
name
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
I
change
it
,
sir
,
because
,
on
the
day
before
I
come
to
Dublin
,
I
kill
a
man
in
deadly
combat
 
<EOS>
an
Englishman
,
sir
,
and
a
captain
in
His
Majesty
's
service
;
<EOS>
and
if
you
offer
to
let
or
hinder
me
in
the
slight
way
,
the
same
arm
which
destroy
him
be
ready
to
punish
you
;
and
by
Heaven
,
sir
,
you
or
I
do
not
leave
this
room
alive
!
"
  
<EOS>
so
say
,
I
draw
my
sword
like
lightning
,
and
give
a
"
ha
!
ha
!
"
and
a
stamp
with
my
foot
,
lunge
within
an
inch
of
fitzsimon
's
heart
,
who
start
back
and
turn
deadly
pale
,
while
his
wife
,
with
a
scream
,
fling
herself
between
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dearest
Redmond
,
"
she
cry
,
"
be
pacify
.
<EOS>
fitzsimon
,
you
do
not
want
the
poor
child
's
blood
.
<EOS>
let
him
escape
 
in
Heaven
's
name
let
him
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
may
go
hang
for
me
,
"
say
fitzsimon
sulkily
;
"
and
he
would
better
be
off
quickly
,
too
,
for
the
jeweller
and
the
tailor
have
call
once
,
and
will
be
here
again
before
long
.
<EOS>
It
be
Moses
the
pawnbroker
that
peach
:
I
have
the
news
from
him
myself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
by
which
I
conclude
that
Mr.
Fitzsimons
have
be
with
the
new
laced
frock
-
coat
which
he
procure
from
the
merchant
tailor
on
the
day
when
the
latter
first
give
me
credit
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
the
end
of
our
conversation
?
<EOS>
where
be
now
a
home
for
the
descendant
of
the
Barrys
?
<EOS>
home
be
shut
to
me
by
my
misfortune
in
the
duel
.
<EOS>
I
be
expel
from
Dublin
by
a
persecution
occasion
,
I
must
confess
,
by
my
own
imprudence
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
time
to
wait
and
choose
:
no
place
of
refuge
to
fly
to
.
<EOS>
fitzsimon
,
after
his
abuse
of
me
,
leave
the
room
growling
,
but
not
hostile
;
his
wife
insist
that
we
should
shake
hand
,
and
he
promise
not
to
molest
me
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
owe
the
fellow
nothing
;
and
,
on
the
contrary
,
have
his
acceptance
actually
in
my
pocket
for
money
lose
at
play
.
<EOS>
as
for
my
friend
Mrs.
Fitzsimons
,
she
sit
down
on
the
bed
and
fairly
burst
out
cry
.
<EOS>
She
have
her
fault
,
but
her
heart
be
kind
;
and
though
she
possess
but
three
shilling
in
the
world
,
and
fourpence
in
copper
,
the
poor
soul
make
me
take
it
before
I
leave
her
 
to
go
 
whither
?
<EOS>
My
mind
be
make
up
:
there
be
a
score
of
recruiting
-
party
in
the
town
beat
up
for
man
to
join
our
gallant
army
in
America
and
Germany
;
I
know
where
to
find
one
of
these
,
have
stand
by
the
sergeant
at
a
review
in
the
Phoenix
Park
,
where
he
point
out
to
me
character
on
the
field
,
for
which
I
treat
him
to
drink
.
  
<EOS>
I
give
one
of
my
shilling
to
Sullivan
the
butler
of
the
fitzsimonse
,
and
,
run
into
the
street
,
hasten
to
the
little
alehouse
at
which
my
acquaintance
be
quarter
,
and
before
ten
minute
have
accept
His
Majesty
's
shilling
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
frankly
that
I
be
a
young
gentleman
in
difficulty
;
that
I
have
kill
an
officer
in
a
duel
,
and
be
anxious
to
get
out
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
but
I
need
not
have
trouble
myself
with
any
explanation
;
King
George
be
too
much
in
want
of
man
then
to
heed
from
whence
they
come
,
and
a
fellow
of
my
inch
<EOS>
,
the
sergeant
say
,
be
always
welcome
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
could
not
,
he
say
,
have
choose
my
time
better
.
<EOS>
a
transport
be
lie
at
Dunleary
,
wait
for
a
wind
,
and
on
board
that
ship
,
to
which
I
march
that
night
,
I
make
some
surprising
discovery
,
which
shall
be
tell
in
the
next
chapter
.
   
<EOS>
in
which
barry
takes
a
near
view
of
MILITARY
GLORY
 
<EOS>
I
never
have
a
taste
for
anything
but
genteel
company
,
and
hate
all
description
of
low
life
.
<EOS>
hence
my
account
of
the
society
in
which
I
at
present
find
myself
must
of
necessity
be
short
;
and
,
indeed
,
the
recollection
of
it
be
profoundly
disagreeable
to
me
.
<EOS>
Pah
!
<EOS>
the
reminiscence
of
the
horrid
black
-
hole
of
a
place
in
which
we
soldier
be
confine
;
of
the
wretched
creature
with
whom
I
be
now
force
to
keep
company
;
of
the
plowman
,
poacher
,
pickpocket
,
who
have
take
refuge
from
poverty
,
or
the
law
(
as
,
in
truth
,
I
have
do
myself
)
,
be
enough
to
make
me
ashamed
even
now
,
and
it
call
the
blush
into
my
old
cheek
to
think
I
be
ever
force
to
keep
such
company
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
fall
into
despair
,
but
that
,
luckily
,
event
occur
to
rouse
my
spirit
,
and
in
some
measure
to
console
me
for
my
misfortune
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
of
these
consolation
I
have
be
a
good
quarrel
,
which
take
place
on
the
day
after
my
entrance
into
the
transport
-
ship
,
with
a
huge
red
-
haired
monster
of
a
fellow
 
a
chairman
,
who
have
enlist
to
fly
from
a
vixen
of
a
wife
,
who
,
boxer
as
he
be
,
have
be
more
than
a
match
for
him
.
<EOS>
as
soon
as
this
fellow
 
Toole
,
I
remember
,
be
his
name
 
get
away
from
the
arm
of
the
washerwoman
<EOS>
his
lady
,
his
natural
courage
and
ferocity
return
,
and
he
become
the
tyrant
of
all
round
about
him
.
<EOS>
all
recruit
,
especially
,
be
the
object
of
the
brute
's
insult
and
ill
-
treatment
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
money
,
as
I
say
,
and
be
sit
very
disconsolately
over
a
platter
of
rancid
bacon
and
mouldy
biscuit
,
which
be
serve
to
us
at
mess
,
when
it
come
to
my
turn
to
be
help
to
drink
,
and
I
be
serve
,
like
the
rest
,
with
a
dirty
tin
noggin
,
contain
somewhat
more
than
half
a
pint
of
rum
-
and
-
water
.
<EOS>
the
beaker
be
so
greasy
and
filthy
that
I
could
not
help
turn
round
to
the
messman
and
say
,
"
Fellow
,
get
me
a
glass
!
"
<EOS>
at
which
all
the
wretch
round
about
me
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
,
the
very
loud
among
them
be
,
of
course
,
Mr.
Toole
.
<EOS>
"
get
the
gentleman
a
towel
for
his
hand
,
and
serve
him
a
basin
of
turtle
-
soup
,
"
roar
the
monster
,
who
be
sit
,
or
rather
squat
,
on
the
deck
opposite
me
;
and
as
he
speak
he
suddenly
seize
my
beaker
of
grog
and
empty
it
,
in
the
midst
of
another
burst
of
applause
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
want
to
vex
him
,
ax
him
about
his
wife
the
washerwoman
,
who
bates
him
,
"
here
whisper
in
my
ear
<EOS>
another
worthy
,
a
retire
link
-
boy
,
who
,
disgust
with
his
profession
,
have
adopt
the
military
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
a
towel
of
your
wife
's
washing
,
Mr.
Toole
?
"
say
I.
<EOS>
"
I
be
tell
she
wipe
your
face
often
with
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
ax
him
why
he
would
not
see
her
yesterday
,
when
she
come
to
the
ship
<EOS>
,
"
continue
the
link
-
boy
.
<EOS>
and
so
I
put
to
him
some
other
foolish
joke
about
soapsud
,
henpecking
,
and
flat
-
iron
,
which
set
the
man
into
a
fury
,
and
succeed
in
raise
a
quarrel
between
us
.
<EOS>
We
should
have
fall
to
at
once
,
but
a
couple
of
grin
marine
,
who
keep
watch
at
the
door
,
for
fear
we
should
repent
of
our
bargain
and
have
a
fancy
to
escape
,
come
forward
and
interpose
between
us
with
fixed
bayonet
;
but
the
sergeant
come
down
the
ladder
,
and
hear
the
dispute
,
condescend
to
say
that
we
may
fight
it
out
like
man
with
FISTES
if
we
choose
,
and
that
the
fore
-
deck
should
be
free
to
us
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
but
the
use
of
fiste
,
as
the
Englishman
call
them
,
be
not
then
general
in
Ireland
,
and
it
be
agree
that
we
should
have
a
pair
of
cudgel
;
with
one
of
which
weapon
<EOS>
I
finish
the
fellow
in
four
minute
,
give
him
a
thump
across
his
stupid
sconce
which
lay
him
lifeless
on
the
deck
,
and
not
receive
myself
a
single
hurt
of
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
this
victory
over
the
cock
of
the
vile
dunghill
obtain
me
respect
among
the
wretch
of
whom
I
form
part
,
and
serve
to
set
up
my
spirit
,
which
otherwise
be
flag
;
and
my
position
be
speedily
make
more
bearable
by
the
arrival
on
board
our
ship
of
an
old
friend
.
<EOS>
this
be
no
other
than
my
second
in
the
fatal
duel
which
have
send
me
thus
early
out
into
the
world
,
Captain
Fagan
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
young
nobleman
who
have
a
company
in
our
regiment
(
Gale
's
foot
)
,
and
who
,
prefer
the
delight
of
the
Mall
and
the
club
to
the
danger
of
a
rough
campaign
,
have
give
Fagan
the
opportunity
of
an
exchange
;
which
,
as
the
latter
have
no
fortune
but
his
sword
,
he
be
glad
to
make
.
<EOS>
the
sergeant
be
put
us
through
our
exercise
on
deck
(
the
seaman
and
officer
of
the
transport
look
grin
on
)
when
a
boat
come
from
the
shore
bring
our
captain
to
the
ship
;
and
though
I
start
and
blush
red
as
he
recognise
me
 
a
descendant
of
the
Barrys
 
in
this
degrade
posture
,
I
promise
you
that
the
sight
of
Fagan
's
face
be
most
welcome
to
me
,
for
it
assure
me
that
a
friend
be
near
me
.
<EOS>
before
that
I
be
so
melancholy
that
I
would
certainly
have
desert
<EOS>
have
I
find
the
mean
,
and
have
not
the
inevitable
marine
keep
a
watch
to
prevent
any
such
escape
.
<EOS>
Fagan
give
me
a
wink
of
recognition
,
but
offer
no
public
token
of
acquaintance
;
it
be
not
until
two
day
afterwards
,
and
when
we
have
bid
adieu
to
old
Ireland
and
be
stand
out
to
sea
,
that
he
call
me
into
his
cabin
,
and
then
,
shake
hand
with
me
cordially
,
give
me
news
,
which
I
much
want
,
of
my
family
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
news
of
you
in
Dublin
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
faith
you
have
begin
early
,
like
your
father
's
son
;
and
I
think
you
could
not
do
better
than
as
you
have
do
.
<EOS>
but
why
do
you
not
write
home
to
your
poor
mother
?
<EOS>
She
have
send
a
half
-
dozen
letter
to
you
at
Dublin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
say
I
have
ask
for
letter
at
the
post
-
office
,
but
there
be
none
for
Mr.
Redmond
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
to
add
that
I
have
be
ashamed
,
after
the
first
week
,
to
write
to
my
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
write
to
her
by
the
pilot
,
"
say
he
,
"
who
will
leave
us
in
two
hour
;
and
you
can
tell
her
that
you
be
safe
,
and
marry
to
Brown
Bess
.
<EOS>
"
I
sigh
when
he
talk
about
be
marry
;
on
which
he
say
with
a
laugh
,
"
I
see
you
be
think
of
a
certain
young
lady
at
Brady
's
Town
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
be
Miss
Brady
well
?
"
say
I
;
and
indeed
,
could
hardly
utter
it
,
for
I
certainly
be
think
about
her
:
for
,
though
I
have
forget
her
in
the
gaiety
of
Dublin
,
I
have
always
find
adversity
make
man
very
affectionate
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
only
seven
Miss
Bradys
now
,
"
answer
Fagan
,
in
a
solemn
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
Nora
"
    
"
good
heaven
!
<EOS>
what
of
her
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
think
grief
have
kill
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
take
on
so
at
your
go
away
that
she
be
oblige
to
console
herself
with
a
husband
.
<EOS>
She
be
now
Mrs.
John
Quin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
John
Quin
!
<EOS>
be
there
another
Mr.
John
Quin
?
"
<EOS>
ask
I
,
quite
wonder
-
stricken
.
  
<EOS>
"
no
;
the
very
same
one
,
my
boy
.
<EOS>
He
recover
from
his
wound
.
<EOS>
the
ball
you
hit
him
with
be
not
likely
to
hurt
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
make
of
tow
.
<EOS>
do
you
think
the
Bradys
would
let
you
kill
fifteen
hundred
a
year
out
of
the
family
?
"
<EOS>
and
then
Fagan
further
tell
me
that
,
in
order
to
get
me
out
of
the
way
 
for
the
cowardly
Englishman
could
never
be
bring
to
marry
from
fear
of
me
 
the
plan
of
the
duel
have
be
arrange
.
"
<EOS>
but
hit
him
you
certainly
do
,
Redmond
,
and
with
a
fine
thick
plugget
of
tow
;
and
the
fellow
be
so
frightened
,
that
he
be
an
hour
in
come
to
.
<EOS>
We
tell
your
mother
the
story
afterwards
,
and
a
pretty
scene
she
make
;
she
despatch
a
half
-
score
of
letter
to
Dublin
after
you
,
but
I
suppose
address
them
to
you
in
your
real
name
,
by
which
you
never
think
to
ask
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
coward
!
<EOS>
"
say
I
(
though
,
I
confess
,
my
mind
be
considerably
relieve
at
the
thought
of
not
have
kill
him
)
.
"
<EOS>
and
do
the
Bradys
of
Castle
Brady
consent
to
admit
a
poltroon
like
that
into
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
honourable
family
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
have
pay
off
your
uncle
's
mortgage
,
"
say
Fagan
;
"
he
give
Nora
<EOS>
a
coach
-
and
-
six
;
he
be
to
sell
out
,
and
Lieutenant
Ulick
Brady
of
the
Militia
be
to
purchase
his
company
.
<EOS>
that
coward
of
a
fellow
have
be
the
making
of
your
uncle
's
family
.
"
<EOS>
faith
!
<EOS>
the
business
be
well
do
.
"
<EOS>
and
then
,
laugh
,
he
tell
me
how
Mick
and
Ulick
have
never
let
him
out
of
their
sight
,
although
he
be
for
desert
to
England
,
until
the
marriage
be
complete
and
the
happy
couple
off
on
their
road
to
Dublin
.
"
<EOS>
be
you
in
want
of
cash
,
my
boy
?
<EOS>
"
continue
the
good
-
natured
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
draw
upon
me
,
for
I
get
a
couple
of
hundred
out
of
Master
Quin
for
my
share
,
and
while
they
last
you
shall
never
want
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
he
bid
me
sit
down
and
write
a
letter
to
my
mother
,
which
I
do
forthwith
in
very
sincere
and
repentant
term
,
state
that
I
have
be
guilty
of
extravagance
,
that
I
have
not
know
until
that
moment
under
what
a
fatal
error
I
have
be
labour
,
and
that
I
have
embark
for
Germany
as
a
volunteer
.
<EOS>
the
letter
be
scarcely
finish
when
the
pilot
sing
out
that
he
be
go
on
shore
;
and
he
depart
,
take
with
him
,
from
many
an
anxious
fellow
besides
myself
,
our
adieux
to
friend
in
old
Ireland
.
  
<EOS>
although
I
be
call
Captain
Barry
for
many
year
of
my
life
,
and
have
be
know
as
such
by
the
first
people
of
Europe
,
yet
<EOS>
I
may
as
well
confess
<EOS>
I
have
no
more
claim
to
the
title
than
many
a
gentleman
who
assume
it
,
and
never
have
a
right
to
an
epaulet
,
or
to
any
military
decoration
high
than
a
corporal
's
stripe
of
worst
.
<EOS>
I
be
make
corporal
by
Fagan
during
our
voyage
to
the
Elbe
,
and
my
rank
be
confirm
on
terra
firma
.
<EOS>
I
be
promise
a
halbert
,
too
,
and
afterwards
,
perhaps
,
an
ensigncy
,
if
I
distinguish
myself
;
but
Fate
do
not
intend
that
I
should
remain
long
an
english
soldier
:
as
shall
appear
presently
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
our
passage
be
very
favourable
;
my
adventure
be
tell
by
Fagan
to
his
brother
officer
,
who
treat
me
with
kindness
;
and
my
victory
over
the
big
chairman
procure
me
respect
from
my
comrade
of
the
fore
-
deck
.
<EOS>
encourage
and
strongly
exhort
by
Fagan
<EOS>
,
I
do
my
duty
resolutely
;
but
,
though
affable
and
good
-
humoured
with
the
man
,
I
never
at
first
condescend
to
associate
with
such
low
fellow
:
and
,
indeed
,
be
call
generally
amongst
them
"
my
Lord
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
be
the
ex
-
link
-
boy
,
a
facetious
knave
,
who
give
me
the
title
;
and
I
feel
that
I
should
become
such
a
rank
as
well
as
any
peer
in
the
kingdom
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
require
a
great
philosopher
and
historian
than
I
be
to
explain
the
cause
of
the
famous
seven
year
'
war
in
which
Europe
be
engage
;
and
,
indeed
,
its
origin
have
always
appear
to
me
to
be
so
complicated
,
and
the
book
write
about
it
so
amazingly
hard
to
understand
,
that
I
have
seldom
be
much
wise
at
the
end
of
a
chapter
than
at
the
beginning
,
and
so
shall
not
trouble
my
reader
with
any
personal
disquisition
concern
the
matter
.
<EOS>
all
I
know
be
,
that
after
His
Majesty
's
love
of
his
hanoverian
dominion
have
render
him
most
unpopular
in
his
english
kingdom
,
with
Mr.
Pitt
at
the
head
of
the
anti
-
german
war
-
party
,
<EOS>
all
of
a
sudden
,
Mr.
Pitt
become
Minister
,
the
rest
of
the
empire
applaud
the
war
as
much
as
they
have
hate
it
before
.
<EOS>
the
victory
of
Dettingen
and
Crefeld
be
in
every
-
body
's
mouth
,
and
"
the
protestant
hero
,
"
as
we
use
to
call
the
godless
old
Frederick
of
Prussia
,
be
adore
by
us
as
a
saint
,
a
very
short
time
after
we
have
be
about
to
make
war
against
him
in
alliance
with
the
Empress
-
queen
.
<EOS>
now
,
somehow
,
we
be
on
Frederick
's
side
:
<EOS>
the
Empress
,
the
French
,
the
Swedes
,
and
the
Russians
,
be
league
against
us
;
and
I
remember
,
when
the
news
of
the
battle
of
Lissa
come
even
to
our
remote
quarter
of
Ireland
,
we
consider
it
as
a
triumph
for
the
cause
of
Protestantism
,
and
illuminate
and
bonfire
,
and
have
a
sermon
at
church
,
and
keep
the
prussian
king
's
birthday
;
on
which
my
uncle
would
get
drunk
:
as
indeed
on
any
other
occasion
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
low
fellow
enlist
with
myself
be
,
of
course
,
Papists
(
the
english
army
be
fill
with
such
,
out
of
that
never
-
fail
country
of
ours
)
,
and
these
,
forsooth
,
be
fight
the
battle
of
Protestantism
with
Frederick
;
who
be
belabour
the
Protestant
Swedes
and
the
Protestant
Saxons
,
as
well
as
the
Russians
of
the
Greek
Church
,
and
the
papist
troop
of
the
Emperor
and
the
King
of
France
.
<EOS>
It
be
against
these
latter
that
the
english
auxiliary
be
employ
,
and
we
know
that
,
be
the
quarrel
<EOS>
what
it
may
,
an
Englishman
and
a
Frenchman
be
pretty
willing
to
make
a
fight
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
We
land
at
Cuxhaven
,
and
before
I
have
be
a
month
in
the
Electorate
<EOS>
I
be
transform
into
a
tall
and
proper
young
soldier
,
and
have
a
natural
aptitude
for
military
exercise
,
be
soon
as
accomplish
at
the
drill
as
the
old
sergeant
in
the
regiment
.
<EOS>
It
be
well
,
however
,
to
dream
of
glorious
war
in
a
snug
arm
-
chair
at
home
;
ay
,
or
to
make
it
as
an
officer
,
surround
by
gentleman
,
gorgeously
dress
,
and
cheer
by
chance
of
promotion
.
<EOS>
but
those
chance
do
not
shine
on
poor
fellow
in
worst
lace
:
the
rough
texture
of
our
red
coat
make
me
ashamed
when
I
see
an
officer
go
by
;
my
soul
use
to
shudder
when
,
on
go
the
round
,
I
would
hear
their
voice
as
they
sit
jovially
over
the
mess
-
table
;
my
pride
revolt
at
be
oblige
to
plaster
my
hair
with
flour
and
candle
-
grease
,
instead
of
use
the
proper
pomatum
for
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
yes
,
my
taste
have
always
be
high
and
fashionable
,
and
I
loathe
the
horrid
company
in
which
I
be
fall
.
<EOS>
what
chance
have
I
of
promotion
?
<EOS>
none
of
my
relative
have
money
to
buy
me
a
commission
,
and
I
become
soon
so
low
-
spirited
,
that
I
long
for
a
general
action
and
a
ball
to
finish
me
,
and
vow
that
I
would
take
some
opportunity
to
desert
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
think
that
I
,
the
descendant
of
the
king
of
Ireland
,
be
threaten
with
a
caning
by
a
young
scoundrel
who
have
just
join
from
Eton
College
 
when
I
think
that
he
offer
to
make
me
his
footman
,
and
that
I
do
not
,
on
either
occasion
,
murder
him
!
<EOS>
on
the
first
occasion
I
burst
into
tear
(
I
do
not
care
to
own
it
)
and
have
serious
thought
of
commit
suicide
,
so
great
be
my
mortification
.
<EOS>
but
my
kind
friend
Fagan
come
to
my
aid
in
the
circumstance
,
with
some
very
timely
consolation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
poor
boy
,
"
say
he
,
"
you
must
not
take
the
matter
to
heart
so
.
<EOS>
caning
be
only
a
relative
disgrace
.
<EOS>
young
Ensign
Fakenham
be
flog
himself
at
Eton
School
only
a
month
ago
:
I
would
lay
a
wager
that
his
scar
be
not
yet
heal
.
<EOS>
You
must
cheer
up
,
my
boy
;
do
your
duty
,
be
a
gentleman
,
and
no
serious
harm
can
fall
on
you
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
hear
afterwards
that
my
champion
have
take
Mr.
Fakenham
very
severely
to
task
for
this
threat
,
and
say
to
him
that
any
such
proceeding
for
the
future
he
should
consider
as
an
insult
to
himself
;
whereon
the
young
ensign
be
,
for
the
moment
,
civil
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
sergeant
,
I
tell
one
of
them
,
that
if
any
man
strike
me
,
no
matter
who
he
may
be
,
or
what
the
penalty
,
I
would
take
his
life
.
<EOS>
and
,
"
faith
!
<EOS>
there
be
an
air
of
sincerity
in
my
speech
which
convince
the
whole
bevy
of
them
;
and
as
long
as
I
remain
in
the
english
service
<EOS>
no
rattan
be
ever
lay
on
the
shoulder
of
Redmond
Barry
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
be
in
that
savage
moody
state
,
that
my
mind
be
quite
make
up
to
the
point
,
and
I
look
to
hear
my
own
dead
march
play
as
sure
as
I
be
alive
.
<EOS>
when
I
be
make
a
corporal
,
some
of
my
evil
be
lessen
;
I
mess
with
the
sergeant
by
special
favour
,
and
use
to
treat
them
to
drink
,
and
lose
money
to
the
rascal
at
play
:
with
which
cash
my
good
friend
Mr.
Fagan
punctually
supply
me
.
  
<EOS>
Our
regiment
,
which
be
quarter
about
Stade
and
Luneburg
,
speedily
get
order
to
march
southward
towards
the
Rhine
,
for
news
come
that
our
great
General
,
Prince
Ferdinand
of
Brunswick
,
have
be
defeat
 
no
,
not
defeat
,
but
foil
in
his
attack
upon
the
French
under
the
Duke
of
Broglio
,
at
Bergen
,
near
Frankfort
-
on
-
the
-
main
,
and
have
be
oblige
to
fall
back
.
<EOS>
as
the
ally
retreat
the
French
rush
forward
,
and
make
a
bold
push
for
the
Electorate
of
our
gracious
monarch
in
Hanover
,
threaten
that
they
would
occupy
it
;
as
they
have
do
before
,
when
D'Estrees
beat
the
hero
of
Culloden
,
the
gallant
Duke
of
Cumberland
,
and
cause
him
to
sign
the
capitulation
of
Closter
Zeven
.
<EOS>
an
advance
upon
Hanover
always
cause
a
great
agitation
in
the
royal
bosom
of
the
King
of
England
;
more
troop
be
send
to
join
us
,
convoy
of
treasure
be
pass
over
to
our
force
,
and
to
our
ally
's
the
King
of
Prussia
;
and
although
,
in
spite
of
all
assistance
,
the
army
under
Prince
Ferdinand
be
very
much
weak
than
that
of
the
invade
enemy
,
yet
we
have
the
advantage
of
well
supply
,
one
of
the
great
general
in
the
world
:
and
,
I
be
go
to
add
,
of
british
valour
,
but
the
less
we
say
about
that
the
well
.
<EOS>
My
Lord
George
Sackville
do
not
exactly
cover
himself
with
laurel
at
Minden
;
otherwise
there
may
have
be
win
there
one
of
the
great
victory
of
modern
time
.
  
<EOS>
throw
himself
between
the
French
and
the
interior
of
the
Electorate
,
Prince
Ferdinand
wisely
take
possession
of
the
free
town
of
Bremen
,
which
he
make
his
storehouse
and
place
of
arm
;
and
round
which
he
gather
all
his
troop
,
make
ready
to
fight
the
famous
battle
of
Minden
.
  
<EOS>
be
these
Memoirs
not
characterise
by
truth
,
and
do
I
deign
to
utter
a
single
word
for
which
my
own
personal
experience
do
not
give
me
the
full
authority
<EOS>
,
I
may
easily
make
myself
the
hero
of
some
strange
and
popular
adventure
,
and
,
after
the
fashion
of
novel
-
writer
,
introduce
my
reader
to
the
great
character
of
this
remarkable
time
.
<EOS>
these
person
(
I
mean
the
romance
-
writer
)
,
if
they
take
a
drummer
or
a
dustman
for
a
hero
,
somehow
manage
to
bring
him
in
contact
with
the
great
lord
and
most
notorious
personage
of
the
empire
;
and
I
warrant
me
<EOS>
there
be
not
one
of
them
but
,
in
describe
the
battle
of
Minden
,
would
manage
to
bring
Prince
Ferdinand
,
and
my
Lord
George
Sackville
,
and
my
Lord
Granby
,
into
presence
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
be
easy
for
me
to
have
say
<EOS>
I
be
present
when
the
order
be
bring
to
Lord
George
to
charge
with
the
cavalry
and
finish
the
rout
of
the
Frenchmen
,
and
when
he
refuse
to
do
so
,
and
thereby
spoil
the
great
victory
.
<EOS>
but
the
fact
be
,
I
be
two
mile
off
from
the
cavalry
when
his
lordship
's
fatal
hesitation
take
place
,
and
none
of
us
soldier
of
the
line
know
of
what
have
occur
until
we
come
to
talk
about
the
fight
over
our
kettle
in
the
evening
,
and
repose
after
the
labours
of
a
hard
-
fought
day
.
<EOS>
I
see
no
one
of
high
rank
that
day
than
my
colonel
and
a
couple
of
orderly
officer
ride
by
in
the
smoke
 
no
one
on
our
side
,
that
be
.
<EOS>
a
poor
corporal
(
as
I
then
have
the
disgrace
of
be
)
be
not
generally
invite
into
the
company
of
commander
and
the
great
;
but
,
in
revenge
,
I
see
,
I
promise
you
,
some
very
good
company
on
the
FRENCH
part
,
for
their
regiment
of
Lorraine
and
Royal
Cravate
be
charge
us
all
day
;
and
in
that
sort
of
MELEE
high
and
low
be
pretty
equally
receive
.
<EOS>
I
hate
bragging
,
but
I
can
not
help
say
that
I
make
a
very
close
acquaintance
with
the
colonel
of
the
Cravates
;
for
I
drive
my
bayonet
into
his
body
,
and
finish
off
a
poor
little
ensign
,
so
young
,
slender
,
and
small
,
that
a
blow
from
my
pigtail
would
have
despatch
him
,
I
think
,
in
place
of
the
butt
of
my
musket
,
with
which
I
club
him
down
.
<EOS>
I
kill
,
besides
,
four
more
officer
and
man
,
and
in
the
poor
ensign
's
pocket
find
a
purse
of
fourteen
louis
-
d'or
,
and
a
silver
box
of
sugar
-
plum
;
of
which
the
former
present
be
very
agreeable
to
me
.
<EOS>
if
people
would
tell
their
story
of
battle
in
this
simple
way
,
I
think
the
cause
of
truth
would
not
suffer
by
it
.
<EOS>
all
I
know
of
this
famous
fight
of
Minden
(
except
from
book
)
be
tell
here
above
.
<EOS>
the
ensign
's
silver
bon
-
bon
box
and
his
purse
of
gold
;
the
livid
face
of
the
poor
fellow
as
he
fall
;
the
huzza
of
the
man
of
my
company
as
I
go
out
under
a
smart
fire
and
rifle
him
;
their
shout
and
curse
as
we
come
hand
in
hand
with
the
Frenchmen
,
 
<EOS>
these
be
,
in
truth
,
not
very
dignified
recollection
,
and
have
best
be
pass
over
briefly
.
<EOS>
when
my
kind
friend
Fagan
be
shoot
,
a
brother
captain
,
and
his
very
good
friend
,
turn
to
Lieutenant
Rawson
and
say
,
"
Fagan
be
down
;
Rawson
,
there
be
your
company
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
the
epitaph
my
brave
patron
get
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
leave
you
a
hundred
guinea

Redmond

be
his
last
word
to
me
,
"
but
for
a
cursed
run
of
ill
luck
last
night
at
faro
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
give
me
a
faint
squeeze
of
the
hand
;
then
,
as
the
word
be
give
to
advance
,
I
leave
him
.
<EOS>
when
we
come
back
to
our
old
ground
,
which
we
presently
do
,
he
be
lie
there
still
;
but
he
be
dead
.
<EOS>
some
of
our
people
have
already
tear
off
his
epaulet
,
and
,
no
doubt
,
have
rifle
his
purse
.
<EOS>
such
knave
and
ruffian
do
man
in
war
become
!
<EOS>
It
be
well
for
gentleman
to
talk
of
the
age
of
chivalry
;
but
remember
the
starve
brute
whom
they
lead
 
man
nurse
in
poverty
,
entirely
ignorant
,
make
to
take
a
pride
in
deed
of
blood
 
man
who
can
have
no
amusement
but
in
drunkenness
,
debauch
,
and
plunder
.
<EOS>
It
be
with
these
shocking
instrument
that
your
great
warrior
and
king
have
be
do
their
murderous
work
in
the
world
;
and
while
,
for
instance
,
we
be
at
the
present
moment
admire
the
"
Great
Frederick
,
"
as
we
call
him
,
and
his
philosophy
,
and
his
liberality
,
and
his
military
genius
,
I
,
who
have
serve
him
,
and
be
,
as
it
be
,
behind
the
scene
of
which
that
great
spectacle
be
compose
,
can
only
look
at
it
with
horror
.
<EOS>
what
a
number
of
item
of
human
crime
,
misery
,
slavery
,
go
to
form
that
sum
-
total
of
glory
!
<EOS>
I
can
recollect
a
certain
day
about
three
week
after
the
battle
of
Minden
,
and
a
farmhouse
in
which
some
of
us
enter
;
and
how
the
old
woman
and
her
daughter
serve
us
,
tremble
,
to
wine
;
and
how
we
get
drunk
over
the
wine
,
and
the
house
be
in
a
flame
,
presently
;
and
woe
betide
the
wretched
fellow
afterwards
who
come
home
to
look
for
his
house
and
his
child
!
   
<EOS>
BARRY
far
from
military
GLORY
 
<EOS>
after
the
death
of
my
protector
,
Captain
Fagan
,
I
be
force
to
confess
that
I
fall
into
the
very
bad
of
course
and
company
.
<EOS>
be
a
rough
soldier
of
fortune
himself
,
he
have
never
be
a
favourite
with
the
officer
of
his
regiment
;
who
have
a
contempt
for
Irishmen
,
as
Englishmen
sometimes
will
have
,
and
use
to
mock
his
brogue
,
and
his
blunt
uncouth
manner
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
insolent
to
one
or
two
of
them
,
and
have
only
be
screen
from
punishment
by
his
intercession
;
especially
his
successor
,
Mr.
Rawson
,
have
no
like
for
me
,
and
put
another
man
into
the
sergeant
's
place
vacant
in
his
company
after
the
battle
of
Minden
.
<EOS>
this
act
of
injustice
render
my
service
very
disagreeable
to
me
;
and
,
instead
of
seek
to
conquer
the
dislike
of
my
superior
,
and
win
their
goodwill
by
good
behaviour
,
I
only
seek
for
mean
to
make
my
situation
easy
to
me
,
and
grasp
at
all
the
amusement
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
in
a
foreign
country
,
with
the
enemy
before
us
,
and
the
people
continually
under
contribution
from
one
side
or
the
other
,
numberless
irregularity
be
permit
to
the
troop
which
would
not
have
be
allow
in
more
peaceable
time
.
<EOS>
I
descend
gradually
to
mix
with
the
sergeant
,
and
to
share
their
amusement
:
drinking
and
gambling
be
,
I
be
sorry
to
say
,
our
principal
pastime
;
and
I
fall
so
readily
into
their
way
,
that
though
only
a
young
lad
of
seventeen
,
I
be
the
master
of
them
all
in
dare
wickedness
;
though
there
be
some
among
them
who
,
I
promise
you
,
be
far
advanced
in
the
science
of
every
kind
of
profligacy
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
be
under
the
provost
-
marshal
's
hand
,
for
a
dead
certainty
,
<EOS>
have
I
continue
much
longer
in
the
army
:
but
an
accident
occur
which
take
me
out
of
the
english
service
in
rather
a
singular
manner
.
  
<EOS>
the
year
in
which
George
II
die
,
our
regiment
have
the
honour
to
be
present
at
the
battle
of
Warburg
(
where
the
Marquis
of
Granby
and
his
horse
fully
retrieve
the
discredit
which
have
fall
upon
the
cavalry
since
Lord
George
Sackville
's
defalcation
at
Minden
)
,
and
where
Prince
Ferdinand
once
more
completely
defeat
the
Frenchmen
.
<EOS>
during
the
action
,
my
lieutenant
,
Mr.
Fakenham
,
of
Fakenham
,
the
gentleman
who
have
threaten
me
,
it
may
be
remember
,
with
the
caning
,
be
strike
by
a
musket
-
ball
in
the
side
.
<EOS>
He
have
show
no
want
of
courage
in
this
or
any
other
occasion
where
he
have
be
call
upon
to
act
against
the
French
;
but
this
be
his
first
wound
,
and
the
young
gentleman
be
exceedingly
frightened
by
it
.
<EOS>
He
offer
five
guinea
to
be
carry
into
the
town
,
which
be
hard
by
;
and
I
and
another
man
,
take
him
up
in
a
cloak
,
manage
to
transport
him
into
a
place
of
decent
appearance
,
where
we
put
him
to
bed
,
and
where
a
young
surgeon
(
who
desire
nothing
well
than
to
take
himself
out
of
the
fire
of
the
musketry
)
go
presently
to
dress
his
wound
.
  
<EOS>
in
order
to
get
into
the
house
,
we
have
be
oblige
,
it
must
be
confess
,
to
fire
into
the
lock
with
our
piece
;
which
summon
bring
an
inhabitant
of
the
house
to
the
door
,
a
very
pretty
and
black
-
eyed
young
woman
,
who
live
there
with
her
old
half
-
blind
father
,
a
retire
Jagdmeister
of
the
Duke
of
Cassel
,
hard
by
.
<EOS>
when
the
French
be
in
the
town
,
Meinherr
's
house
have
suffer
like
those
of
his
neighbour
;
and
he
be
at
first
exceedingly
unwilling
to
accommodate
his
guest
.
<EOS>
but
the
first
knocking
at
the
door
have
the
effect
of
bring
a
speedy
answer
;
and
Mr.
Fakenham
,
take
a
couple
of
guinea
out
of
a
very
full
purse
,
speedily
convince
the
people
that
they
have
only
to
deal
with
a
person
of
honour
.
  
<EOS>
leave
the
doctor
(
who
be
very
glad
to
stop
)
with
his
patient
,
who
pay
me
the
stipulate
reward
,
I
be
return
to
my
regiment
with
my
other
comrade
 
after
have
pay
,
in
my
german
jargon
,
some
deserve
compliment
to
the
black
-
eyed
beauty
of
Warburg
,
and
thinking
,
with
no
small
envy
,
how
comfortable
it
would
be
to
be
billet
there
 
when
the
private
who
be
with
me
cut
short
my
reverie
by
suggest
that
we
should
divide
the
five
guinea
the
lieutenant
have
give
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
your
share
,
"
say
I
,
give
the
fellow
one
piece
;
which
be
plenty
,
as
I
be
the
leader
of
the
expedition
.
<EOS>
but
he
swear
a
dreadful
oath
that
he
would
have
half
;
and
when
I
tell
him
to
go
to
a
quarter
which
I
shall
not
name
,
the
fellow
,
lift
his
musket
,
hit
me
a
blow
with
the
butt
-
end
of
it
,
which
send
me
lifeless
to
the
ground
:
when
I
awake
from
my
trance
,
I
find
myself
bleed
with
a
large
wound
in
the
head
,
and
have
barely
time
to
stagger
back
to
the
house
where
I
have
leave
the
lieutenant
,
when
I
again
fall
faint
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
here
I
must
have
be
discover
by
the
surgeon
on
his
issuing
out
;
for
when
I
awake
a
second
time
I
find
myself
in
the
ground
-
floor
of
the
house
,
support
by
the
black
-
eyed
girl
,
while
the
surgeon
be
copiously
bleed
me
at
the
arm
.
<EOS>
there
be
another
bed
in
the
room
where
the
lieutenant
have
be
lay
,
 
<EOS>
it
be
that
occupy
by
Gretel
,
the
servant
;
while
Lischen
,
as
my
fair
one
be
call
,
have
,
till
now
,
sleep
in
the
couch
where
the
wound
officer
lie
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
you
put
into
that
bed
?
"
say
he
languidly
,
in
German
;
for
the
ball
have
be
extract
from
his
side
with
much
pain
and
loss
of
blood
.
  
<EOS>
They
tell
him
it
be
the
corporal
who
have
bring
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
a
corporal
?
<EOS>
"
say
he
,
in
English
;
"
turn
him
out
.
"
<EOS>
and
you
may
be
sure
I
feel
highly
compliment
by
the
word
.
<EOS>
but
we
be
both
too
faint
to
compliment
or
to
abuse
each
other
much
,
and
I
be
put
to
bed
carefully
;
and
,
on
be
undress
,
have
an
opportunity
to
find
that
my
pocket
have
be
rifle
by
the
english
soldier
after
he
have
knock
me
down
.
<EOS>
however
,
I
be
in
good
quarter
:
the
young
lady
who
shelter
me
presently
bring
me
a
refreshing
drink
;
and
,
as
I
take
it
,
I
could
not
help
press
the
kind
hand
that
give
it
me
;
nor
,
in
truth
,
do
this
token
of
my
gratitude
seem
unwelcome
.
  
<EOS>
this
intimacy
do
not
decrease
with
further
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
I
find
Lischen
the
tender
of
nurse
.
<EOS>
whenever
any
delicacy
be
to
be
provide
for
the
wound
lieutenant
,
a
share
be
always
send
to
the
bed
opposite
his
,
and
to
the
avaricious
man
be
no
small
annoyance
.
<EOS>
His
illness
be
long
.
<EOS>
on
the
second
day
the
fever
declare
itself
;
for
some
night
he
be
delirious
;
and
I
remember
it
be
when
a
command
officer
be
inspect
our
quarter
,
with
an
intention
,
very
likely
,
of
billet
himself
on
the
house
,
that
the
howling
and
mad
word
of
the
patient
overhead
strike
him
,
and
he
retire
rather
frighten
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
sit
up
very
comfortably
in
the
low
apartment
,
for
my
hurt
be
quite
subsided
;
and
it
be
only
when
the
officer
ask
me
,
with
a
rough
voice
,
why
I
be
not
at
my
regiment
,
that
I
begin
to
reflect
how
pleasant
my
quarter
be
to
me
,
and
that
I
be
much
well
here
than
crawl
under
an
odious
tent
with
a
parcel
of
tipsy
soldier
,
or
go
the
night
-
round
or
rise
long
before
daybreak
for
drill
.
  
<EOS>
the
delirium
of
Mr.
Fakenham
give
me
a
hint
,
and
I
determine
forthwith
to
go
MAD
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
poor
fellow
about
Brady
's
Town
call
"
wander
Billy
,
"
whose
insane
prank
I
have
often
mimic
as
a
lad
,
and
I
again
put
them
in
practice
.
<EOS>
that
night
I
make
an
attempt
upon
Lischen
,
salute
her
with
a
yell
and
a
grin
which
frighten
her
almost
out
of
her
wit
;
and
when
anybody
come
I
be
rave
.
<EOS>
the
blow
on
the
head
have
disorder
my
brain
;
the
doctor
be
ready
to
vouch
for
this
fact
.
<EOS>
one
night
I
whisper
to
him
that
I
be
Julius
Caesar
,
and
consider
him
to
be
my
affiance
wife
Queen
Cleopatra
,
which
convince
him
of
my
insanity
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
if
Her
Majesty
have
be
like
my
Aesculapius
,
she
must
have
have
a
carroty
beard
,
such
as
be
rare
in
Egypt
.
  
<EOS>
a
movement
on
the
part
of
the
french
speedily
cause
an
advance
on
our
part
.
<EOS>
the
town
be
evacuate
,
except
by
a
few
prussian
troop
,
whose
surgeon
be
to
visit
the
wound
in
the
place
;
and
,
when
we
be
well
,
we
be
to
be
draft
to
our
regiment
.
<EOS>
I
determine
that
I
never
would
join
mine
again
.
<EOS>
My
intention
be
to
make
for
Holland
,
almost
the
only
neutral
country
of
Europe
in
those
time
,
and
thence
to
get
a
passage
somehow
to
England
,
and
home
to
dear
old
Brady
's
Town
.
  
<EOS>
if
Mr.
Fakenham
be
now
alive
,
I
here
tender
him
my
apology
for
my
conduct
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
very
rich
;
he
use
me
very
ill
.
<EOS>
I
manage
to
frighten
away
his
servant
who
come
to
attend
him
after
the
affair
of
Warburg
,
and
from
that
time
would
sometimes
condescend
to
wait
upon
the
patient
,
who
always
treat
me
with
scorn
;
but
it
be
my
object
to
have
him
alone
,
and
I
bear
his
brutality
with
the
utmost
civility
and
mildness
,
meditate
in
my
own
mind
a
very
pretty
return
for
all
his
favour
to
me
.
<EOS>
nor
be
I
the
only
person
in
the
house
to
whom
the
worthy
gentleman
be
uncivil
.
<EOS>
He
order
the
fair
Lischen
hither
and
thither
,
make
impertinent
love
to
her
,
abuse
her
soup
,
quarrel
with
her
omelette
,
and
grudge
the
money
which
be
lay
out
for
his
maintenance
;
so
that
our
hostess
detest
him
as
much
as
,
I
think
,
without
vanity
,
she
regard
me
.
  
<EOS>
for
,
if
the
truth
must
be
tell
,
I
have
make
very
deep
love
to
her
during
my
stay
under
her
roof
;
as
be
always
my
way
with
woman
,
of
whatever
age
or
degree
of
beauty
.
<EOS>
to
a
man
who
have
to
make
his
way
in
the
world
,
these
dear
girl
can
always
be
useful
in
one
fashion
or
another
;
never
mind
,
if
they
repel
your
passion
;
at
any
rate
,
they
be
not
offend
with
your
declaration
of
it
,
and
only
look
upon
you
with
more
favourable
eye
in
consequence
of
your
misfortune
.
<EOS>
as
for
Lischen
,
I
tell
her
such
a
pathetic
story
of
my
life
(
a
tale
a
great
deal
more
romantic
than
that
here
narrate
,
 
for
I
do
not
restrict
myself
to
the
exact
truth
in
that
history
,
as
in
these
page
I
be
bind
to
do
)
,
<EOS>
that
I
win
the
poor
girl
's
heart
entirely
,
and
,
besides
,
make
considerable
progress
in
the
german
language
under
her
instruction
.
<EOS>
do
not
think
me
very
cruel
and
heartless
,
lady
;
this
heart
of
Lischen
's
be
like
many
a
town
in
the
neighbourhood
in
which
she
dwelt
,
and
have
be
storm
and
occupy
several
time
before
I
come
to
invest
it
;
now
mount
french
colour
,
now
green
and
yellow
Saxon
,
now
black
and
white
Prussian
,
as
the
case
may
be
.
<EOS>
a
lady
who
set
her
heart
upon
a
lad
in
uniform
must
prepare
to
change
lover
pretty
quickly
,
or
her
life
will
be
but
a
sad
one
.
  
<EOS>
the
german
surgeon
who
attend
us
after
the
departure
of
the
English
only
condescend
to
pay
our
house
a
visit
twice
during
my
residence
;
and
I
take
care
,
for
a
reason
I
have
,
to
receive
him
in
a
darkened
room
,
much
to
the
annoyance
of
Mr.
Fakenham
,
who
lie
there
:
<EOS>
but
I
say
the
light
affect
my
eye
dreadfully
since
my
blow
on
the
head
;
and
so
I
cover
up
my
head
with
clothe
when
the
doctor
come
,
and
tell
him
that
I
be
an
egyptian
mummy
,
or
talk
to
him
some
insane
nonsense
,
in
order
to
keep
up
my
character
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
that
nonsense
you
be
talk
about
an
egyptian
mummy
,
fellow
?
"
ask
Mr.
Fakenham
peevishly
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
you
will
know
soon
,
sir
,
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
the
next
time
that
I
expect
the
doctor
to
come
,
instead
of
receive
him
in
a
darkened
room
,
with
handkerchiefs
muffle
,
I
take
care
to
be
in
the
low
room
,
and
be
have
a
game
at
card
with
Lischen
as
the
surgeon
enter
.
<EOS>
I
have
take
possession
of
a
dressing
-
jacket
of
the
lieutenant
's
,
and
some
other
article
of
his
wardrobe
,
which
fit
me
pretty
well
;
and
,
I
flatter
myself
,
be
no
ungentlemanlike
figure
.
  
<EOS>
"
good
-
morrow
,
Corporal
,
"
say
the
doctor
,
rather
gruffly
,
in
reply
to
my
smile
salute
.
  
<EOS>
"
Corporal
!
<EOS>
Lieutenant
,
if
you
please
,
"
answer
I
,
give
an
arch
look
at
Lischen
,
whom
I
have
instruct
in
my
plot
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
lieutenant
?
<EOS>
"
ask
the
surgeon
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
the
lieutenant
be
"
    
"
upon
my
word
,
you
do
me
great
honour
,
"
cry
I
,
laugh
;
"
you
mistake
me
for
the
mad
corporal
upstairs
.
<EOS>
the
fellow
have
once
or
twice
pretend
to
be
an
officer
,
but
my
kind
hostess
here
can
answer
which
be
which
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
yesterday
he
fancy
he
be
Prince
Ferdinand
,
"
say
Lischen
;
"
the
day
you
come
he
say
he
be
an
egyptian
mummy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
he
do
,
"
say
the
doctor
;
"
I
remember
;
but
,
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
Lieutenant
<EOS>
,
I
have
in
my
note
make
a
mistake
in
you
two
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
talk
to
me
about
his
malady
;
he
be
calm
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lischen
and
I
laugh
at
this
error
as
at
the
most
ridiculous
thing
in
the
world
;
and
when
the
surgeon
go
up
to
examine
his
patient
,
I
caution
him
not
to
talk
to
him
about
the
subject
of
his
malady
,
for
he
be
in
a
very
excited
state
.
  
<EOS>
the
reader
will
be
able
to
gather
from
the
above
conversation
what
my
design
really
be
.
<EOS>
I
be
determined
to
escape
,
and
to
escape
under
the
character
of
Lieutenant
Fakenham
;
take
it
from
him
to
his
face
,
as
it
be
,
and
make
use
of
it
to
meet
my
imperious
necessity
.
<EOS>
It
be
forgery
and
robbery
<EOS>
,
if
you
like
;
for
I
take
all
his
money
and
clothe
,
 
I
do
not
care
to
conceal
it
;
but
the
need
be
so
urgent
,
that
I
would
do
so
again
:
and
I
know
I
could
not
effect
my
escape
without
his
purse
,
as
well
as
his
name
.
<EOS>
hence
it
become
my
duty
to
take
possession
of
one
and
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
lieutenant
lie
still
in
bed
upstairs
,
I
do
not
hesitate
at
all
about
assume
his
uniform
,
especially
after
take
care
to
inform
myself
from
the
doctor
whether
any
man
of
our
who
may
know
me
be
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
none
that
I
could
hear
of
;
and
so
I
calmly
take
my
walk
with
Madame
Lischen
,
dress
in
the
lieutenant
's
uniform
,
make
inquiry
as
to
a
horse
that
I
want
to
purchase
,
report
myself
to
the
commandant
of
the
place
as
Lieutenant
Fakenham
,
of
Gale
's
english
regiment
of
foot
,
convalescent
,
and
be
ask
to
dine
with
the
officer
of
the
prussian
regiment
at
a
very
sorry
mess
they
have
.
<EOS>
how
Fakenham
would
have
storm
and
rage
,
have
he
know
the
use
I
be
make
of
his
name
!
  
<EOS>
whenever
that
worthy
use
to
inquire
about
his
clothe
,
which
he
do
with
many
oath
and
curse
that
he
would
have
me
cane
at
the
regiment
for
inattention
,
I
,
with
a
most
respectful
air
,
inform
him
that
they
be
put
away
in
perfect
safety
below
;
and
,
in
fact
,
have
them
very
neatly
pack
,
and
ready
for
the
day
when
I
propose
to
depart
.
<EOS>
His
paper
and
money
,
however
,
he
keep
under
his
pillow
;
and
,
as
I
have
purchase
a
horse
,
it
become
necessary
to
pay
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
at
a
certain
hour
,
then
,
I
order
the
animal
to
be
bring
round
,
when
I
would
pay
the
dealer
for
him
.
<EOS>
(
I
shall
pass
over
my
adieux
with
my
kind
hostess
,
which
be
very
tearful
indeed
)
.
<EOS>
and
then
,
make
up
my
mind
to
the
great
action
,
walk
upstairs
to
Fakenham
's
room
attire
in
his
full
regimental
,
and
with
his
hat
cock
over
my
left
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
gweat
scoundWel
!
"
say
he
,
with
a
multiplicity
of
oath
;
<EOS>
"
you
mutinous
dog
!
<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
by
dwesse
yourself
in
my
wegimental
?
<EOS>
as
sure
as
my
name
's
Fakenham
,
when
we
get
back
to
the
Wegiment
,
I
will
have
your
soul
cut
out
of
your
body
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
promote
,
Lieutenant
,
"
say
I
,
with
a
sneer
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
come
to
take
my
leave
of
you
;
"
and
then
go
up
to
his
bed
,
I
say
,
"
I
intend
to
have
your
paper
and
purse
.
"
<EOS>
with
this
I
put
my
hand
under
his
pillow
;
at
which
he
give
a
scream
that
may
have
call
the
whole
garrison
about
my
ear
.
"
<EOS>
Hark
ye
,
sir
!
"
say
I
,
"
no
more
noise
,
or
you
be
a
dead
man
!
"
<EOS>
and
take
a
handkerchief
,
I
bind
it
tight
around
his
mouth
so
as
well
-
nigh
to
throttle
him
,
and
,
pull
forward
the
sleeve
of
his
shirt
,
tie
them
in
a
knot
together
,
and
so
leave
him
;
remove
the
paper
and
the
purse
,
you
may
be
sure
,
and
wish
him
politely
a
good
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
the
mad
corporal
,
"
say
I
to
the
people
down
below
who
be
attract
by
the
noise
from
the
sick
man
's
chamber
;
and
so
take
leave
of
the
old
blind
Jagdmeister
,
and
an
adieu
(
I
will
not
say
how
tender
)
of
his
daughter
,
I
mount
my
newly
purchase
animal
;
<EOS>
and
,
as
I
prance
away
,
and
the
sentinel
present
arm
to
me
at
the
town
-
gate
,
feel
once
more
that
I
be
in
my
proper
sphere
,
and
determine
never
again
to
fall
from
the
rank
of
a
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
at
first
the
way
towards
Bremen
,
where
our
army
be
,
and
give
out
that
I
be
bring
report
and
letter
from
the
prussian
commandant
of
Warburg
to
headquarters
;
but
,
as
soon
as
I
get
out
of
sight
of
the
advanced
sentinel
,
I
turn
bridle
and
ride
into
the
Hesse
-
Cassel
territory
,
which
be
luckily
not
very
far
from
Warburg
:
and
I
promise
you
I
be
very
glad
to
see
the
blue
-
and
-
red
stripe
on
the
barrier
,
which
show
me
that
I
be
out
of
the
land
occupy
by
our
countryman
.
<EOS>
I
ride
to
Hof
,
and
the
next
day
to
Cassel
,
give
out
that
I
be
the
bearer
of
despatch
to
Prince
Henry
,
then
on
the
Lower
Rhine
,
and
put
up
at
the
good
hotel
of
the
place
,
where
the
field
-
officer
of
the
garrison
have
their
ordinary
.
<EOS>
these
gentleman
I
treat
to
the
good
wine
that
the
house
afford
,
for
I
be
determined
to
keep
up
the
character
of
the
english
gentleman
,
and
I
talk
to
them
about
my
english
estate
with
a
fluency
that
almost
make
me
believe
in
the
story
which
I
invent
.
<EOS>
I
be
even
ask
to
an
assembly
at
Wilhelmshohe
,
the
elector
's
palace
,
and
dance
a
minuet
there
with
the
Hofmarshal
's
lovely
daughter
,
and
lose
a
few
piece
to
his
excellency
the
first
huntmaster
of
his
Highness
.
  
<EOS>
at
our
table
at
the
inn
there
be
a
prussian
officer
who
treat
me
with
great
civility
,
and
ask
me
a
thousand
question
about
England
;
which
I
answer
as
best
I
may
.
<EOS>
but
this
good
,
I
be
bind
to
say
,
be
bad
enough
.
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
about
England
,
and
the
Court
,
and
the
noble
family
there
;
but
,
lead
away
by
the
vaingloriousness
of
youth
(
and
a
propensity
which
I
possess
in
my
early
day
,
but
of
which
I
have
long
since
correct
myself
,
to
boast
and
talk
in
a
manner
not
altogether
consonant
with
truth
)
,
I
invent
a
thousand
story
which
I
tell
him
;
describe
the
King
and
the
Ministers
to
him
,
say
the
british
Ambassador
at
Berlin
be
my
uncle
,
and
promise
my
acquaintance
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
him
.
<EOS>
when
the
officer
ask
me
my
uncle
's
name
,
I
be
not
able
to
give
him
the
real
name
,
and
so
say
his
name
be
O'Grady
:
<EOS>
it
be
as
good
a
name
as
any
other
,
and
those
of
Kilballyowen
,
county
Cork
,
be
as
good
a
family
as
any
in
the
world
,
as
I
have
hear
.
<EOS>
as
for
story
about
my
regiment
,
of
these
,
of
course
,
I
have
no
lack
.
<EOS>
I
wish
my
other
history
have
be
equally
authentic
.
  
<EOS>
on
the
morning
I
leave
Cassel
,
my
prussian
friend
come
to
me
with
an
open
smile
countenance
,
and
say
he
,
too
,
be
bind
for
Dusseldorf
,
whither
<EOS>
I
say
my
route
lie
;
and
so
lay
our
horse
'
head
together
we
jog
on
.
<EOS>
the
country
be
desolate
beyond
description
.
<EOS>
the
prince
in
whose
dominion
we
be
be
know
to
be
the
most
ruthless
seller
of
man
in
Germany
.
<EOS>
He
would
sell
to
any
bidder
,
and
during
the
five
year
which
the
war
(
afterwards
call
the
Seven
year
'
war
)
have
now
last
,
have
so
exhaust
the
male
of
his
principality
,
that
the
field
remain
untilled
:
even
the
child
of
twelve
year
old
be
drive
off
to
the
war
,
and
I
see
herd
of
these
wretch
march
forwards
,
attend
by
a
few
trooper
,
now
under
the
guidance
of
a
red
-
coated
hanovarian
sergeant
,
now
with
a
prussian
sub
-
officer
accompany
them
;
with
some
of
whom
my
companion
exchange
sign
of
recognition
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
hurt
my
feeling
,
"
say
he
,
"
to
be
oblige
to
commune
with
such
wretch
;
but
the
stern
necessity
of
war
demand
man
continually
,
and
hence
these
recruiter
whom
you
see
market
in
human
flesh
.
<EOS>
They
get
five
-
and
-
twenty
dollar
from
our
Government
for
every
man
they
bring
in
.
<EOS>
for
fine
man
 
for
man
like
you
,
"
he
add
,
laugh
,
"
we
would
go
as
high
as
a
hundred
.
<EOS>
in
the
old
King
's
time
we
would
have
give
a
thousand
for
you
,
when
he
have
his
giant
regiment
that
our
present
monarch
disband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
one
of
them
,
"
say
I
,
"
who
serve
with
you
:
we
use
to
call
him
Morgan
Prussia
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
indeed
;
and
who
be
this
Morgan
Prussia
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
a
huge
grenadier
of
our
,
who
be
somehow
snap
up
in
Hanover
by
some
of
your
recruiter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
rascal
!
<EOS>
"
say
my
friend
:
"
and
do
they
dare
take
an
Englishman
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
faith
this
be
an
Irishman
,
and
a
great
deal
too
sharp
for
them
;
as
you
shall
hear
.
<EOS>
Morgan
be
take
,
then
,
and
draft
into
the
giant
guard
,
and
be
the
big
man
almost
among
all
the
giant
there
.
<EOS>
many
of
these
monster
use
to
complain
of
their
life
,
and
their
caning
,
and
their
long
drill
,
and
their
small
pay
;
but
Morgan
be
not
one
of
the
grumbler
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
deal
well
,
"
say
he
,
"
to
get
fat
here
in
Berlin
,
than
to
starve
in
rag
in
Tipperary
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
Tipperary
?
"
ask
my
companion
.
  
<EOS>
"
that
be
exactly
what
Morgan
's
friend
ask
him
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
beautiful
district
in
Ireland
,
the
capital
of
which
be
the
magnificent
city
of
Clonmel
:
a
city
,
let
me
tell
you
,
sir
,
only
inferior
to
Dublin
and
London
,
and
far
more
sumptuous
than
any
on
the
continent
.
<EOS>
well
,
Morgan
say
that
his
birthplace
be
near
that
city
,
and
the
only
thing
which
cause
him
unhappiness
,
in
his
present
situation
,
be
the
thought
that
his
brother
be
still
starve
at
home

when
they
may
be
so
much
well
off
in
His
Majesty

Faith

say
Morgan
to
the
sergeant

to
whom
he
impart
the
information
,
"
it
be
my

He
say
nothing
more
at
the
time
regard
his
brother
,
but
only
sigh
as
if
lament
their
hard
fate
.
<EOS>
however
,
the
story
be
tell
by
the
sergeant
to
the
officer
,
and
by
the
officer
to
the
King
himself
;
and
His
Majesty
be
so
inflame
by
curiosity
,
that
he
actually
consent
to
let
Morgan
go
home
in
order
to
bring
back
with
him
his
seven
enormous
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
be
they
as
big
as
Morgan
pretend
?
"
ask
my
comrade
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
laugh
at
his
simplicity
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
you
suppose
,
"
cry
I
,
"
that
Morgan
ever
come
back
?
<EOS>
no
,
no
;
once
free
,
he
be
too
wise
for
that
.
<EOS>
He
have
buy
a
snug
farm
in
Tipperary
with
the
money
that
be
give
him
to
secure
his
brother
;
and
I
fancy
few
man
of
the
guard
ever
profit
so
much
by
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
prussian
captain
laugh
exceedingly
at
this
story
,
say
that
the
English
be
the
clever
nation
in
the
world
,
and
,
on
my
set
him
right
,
agree
that
the
Irish
be
even
more
so
.
<EOS>
We
ride
on
very
well
pleased
with
each
other
;
for
he
have
a
thousand
story
of
the
war
to
tell
,
of
the
skill
and
gallantry
of
Frederick
,
and
the
thousand
escape
,
and
victory
,
and
defeat
scarcely
less
glorious
than
victory
,
through
which
the
King
have
pass
.
<EOS>
now
that
I
be
a
gentleman
,
I
could
listen
with
admiration
to
these
tale
:
and
yet
the
sentiment
record
at
the
end
of
the
last
chapter
<EOS>
be
uppermost
in
my
mind
but
three
week
back
,
when
I
remember
that
it
be
the
great
general
get
the
glory
,
and
the
poor
soldier
only
insult
and
the
cane
.
  
<EOS>
"
by
the
way
,
to
whom
be
you
take
despatch
?
"
<EOS>
ask
the
officer
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
another
ugly
question
,
which
I
determine
to
answer
at
hap
-
hazard
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
say
"
to
General
Rolls
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
see
the
general
a
year
before
,
and
give
the
first
name
in
my
head
.
<EOS>
My
friend
be
quite
satisfied
with
it
,
and
we
continue
our
ride
until
evening
come
on
;
and
our
horse
be
weary
<EOS>
,
it
be
agree
that
we
should
come
to
a
halt
.
  
<EOS>
"
there
be
a
very
good
inn
,
"
say
the
Captain
,
as
we
ride
up
to
what
appear
to
me
a
very
lonely
-
looking
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
this
may
be
a
very
good
inn
for
Germany
,
"
say
I
,
"
but
it
would
not
pass
in
old
Ireland
.
<EOS>
Corbach
be
only
a
league
off
:
let
us
push
on
for
Corbach
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
do
you
want
to
see
the
lovely
woman
in
Europe
?
"
say
the
officer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
!
<EOS>
you
sly
rogue
<EOS>
,
I
see
that
will
influence
you
;
"
and
,
truth
to
say
,
such
a
proposal
be
always
welcome
to
me
,
as
I
do
not
care
to
own
.
<EOS>
"
the
people
be
great
farmer
,
"
say
the
Captain
,
"
as
well
as
innkeeper
;
"
and
,
indeed
,
the
place
seem
more
a
farm
than
an
inn
yard
.
<EOS>
We
enter
by
a
great
gate
into
a
Court
wall
round
,
and
at
one
end
of
which
be
the
building
,
a
dingy
ruinous
place
.
<EOS>
a
couple
of
covered
waggen
be
in
the
court
,
their
horse
be
litter
under
a
shed
hard
by
,
and
lounge
about
the
place
be
some
man
and
a
pair
of
sergeant
in
the
prussian
uniform
,
who
both
touch
their
hat
to
my
friend
the
Captain
.
<EOS>
this
customary
formality
strike
me
as
nothing
extraordinary
,
but
the
aspect
of
the
inn
have
something
exceedingly
chilling
and
forbid
in
it
,
and
I
observe
the
man
shut
to
the
great
yard
-
gate
as
soon
as
we
be
enter
.
<EOS>
party
of
french
horseman
,
the
Captain
say
,
be
about
the
country
,
and
one
could
not
take
too
many
precaution
against
such
villain
.
  
<EOS>
We
go
into
supper
,
after
the
two
sergeant
have
take
charge
of
our
horse
;
the
Captain
,
also
,
order
one
of
them
to
take
my
valise
to
my
bedroom
.
<EOS>
I
promise
the
worthy
fellow
a
glass
of
schnapps
for
his
pain
.
  
<EOS>
a
dish
of
fried
egg
-
and
-
bacon
be
order
from
a
hideous
old
wench
that
come
to
serve
us
,
in
place
of
the
lovely
creature
I
have
expect
to
see
;
and
the
Captain
,
laughing
,
say
,
"
well
,
our
meal
be
a
frugal
one
,
but
a
soldier
have
many

and
,
take
off
his
hat
,
sword

belt
,
and
glove
,
with
great
ceremony
,
he
sit
down
to
eat
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
be
behindhand
with
him
in
politeness
,
and
put
my
weapon
securely
on
the
old
chest
of
drawer
where
his

lay
.
  
<EOS>
the
hideous
old
woman
before
mention
bring
us
in
a
pot
of
very
sour
wine
,
at
which
and
at
her
ugliness
I
feel
a
considerable
ill

humour

<EOS>
"
where

"
say
I
,
as
soon
as
the
old

have
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bah

"
say
he
,
laugh

and
look
hard
at
me
:
"
it

<EOS>
I
be
tired

Will

spring
at

like

agile

He
take

I

a

which
have
the
anticipated

the

hesitate
at
no

to
supply
those
brilliant
regiment

the

this

who

extravagance

and
find
his
calling
as

decoy
far
more
profitable

his

<EOS>
the

too

probably
find
his

more
useful
in

<EOS>
His

Monsieur

he
be
one
of
the
most
successful
of
the
practiser
of
his
rascally
trade

<EOS>
He
speak
all
language

know
all
country

and
hence
have
no
difficulty
in
find
out
the
simple
braggadocio
of
a

lad
like
me

<EOS>
about
1765

however

he
come
to
his

<EOS>
He
be
at

live
at

and
use
to
take
his
walk
upon
the
bridge
there
,
and
get
into
conversation
with
the
french
advanced
sentinel
;
to
whom
he
be
in
the
habit
of
promise
"
mountain
and
marvel
,
"
as
the
French
say
,
if
they
would
take
service
in
Prussia

<EOS>
one
day
there
be
on
the
bridge
a
superb
grenadier

whom
Galgenstein
accost
,
and
to
whom
he
promise
a
company

at

,
if
he
would

<EOS>
"
ask
my

yonder

I

We

we

sleep
in

<EOS>
if
he
will
go

you
will

him
a

I
will
go
too

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
bring
your
comrade
over
to
Kehl

"
say
Galgenstein
,
delighted
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
give
you
the
good
of
dinner
,
and
can
promise
to
satisfy
both
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
have
you
not
better
speak
to
him
on
the
bridge
?
"
say
the
grenadier
.
<EOS>
"
I
dare
not
leave
my

but
you

but
to

talk
over
the

"
  
<EOS>
Galgenstein
,
after
a
little
parley
,
pass
the
sentinel
;
but
presently
a
panic
take
him
,
and
he
retrace
his
step
.
<EOS>
but
the
grenadier
bring
his
bayonet
to
the
Prussian
's
breast
and
bade
him
<EOS>
stand
:
<EOS>
that
he

<EOS>
the
Prussian

however
,
see
his
danger
,
make
a
bind
across
the
bridge
and
into
the
Rhine

whither
,
fling
aside
his

the
intrepid
sentry
follow
him

<EOS>
the
Frenchman

him
to

side

where
he
give

<EOS>
"
You

the

you

It

,
as
I
have
say
,
in
the
courtyard
of
the
farm
,
with
another
dismal
vehicle
of
the
same
kind
hard
by
it
.
<EOS>
each
be
pretty
well
fill
with
a
crew
of
man
,
whom
the
atrocious
crimp
who
have
seize
upon
me
,
have
enlist
under
the
banner
of
the
glorious
Frederick
;
and
I
could
see
by
the
lantern
of
the
sentinel
,
as
they
thrust
me
into
the
straw
,
a
dozen
dark
figure
huddle
together
in
the
horrible
moving
prison
where
I
be
now
to
be
confine
.
<EOS>
a
scream
and
a
curse
from
my
opposite
neighbour
show
me
that
he
be
most
likely
wound
,
as
I
myself
be
;
and
,
during
the
whole
of
the
wretched
night
,
the
moan
and
sobs
of
the
poor
fellow
in
similar
captivity
keep
up
a
continual
painful
chorus
,
which
effectually
prevent
my
get
any
relief
from
my
ill
in
sleep
.
<EOS>
at
midnight
(
as
far
as
I
could
judge
)
<EOS>
the
horse
be
put
to
the
waggon
,
and
the
creaking
lumber
machine
be
put
in
motion
.
<EOS>
a
couple
of
soldier
,
strongly
armed
,
sit
on
the
outer
bench
of
the
cart
,
and
their
grim
face
peer
in
with
their
lantern
every
now
and
then
through
the
canvas
curtain
,
that
they
may
count
the
number
of
their
prisoner
.
<EOS>
the
brute
be
half
-
drunk
,
and
be
singe
love
and
war
song
,
such
as
"
o
Gretchen
mein
<EOS>
Taubchen
,
mein
Herzenstrompet
,
Mein
Kanon
<EOS>
,
mein
Heerpauk
und
meine
musket
,
"
"
Prinz
Eugen
der
edle
Ritter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
the
like
;
their
wild
whoop
and
jodel
make
doleful
discord
with
the
groan
of
us
captive
within
the
waggon
.
<EOS>
many
a
time
afterwards
have
I
hear
these
ditty
sing
on
the
march
,
or
in
the
barrack
-
room
,
or
round
the
fire
as
we
lay
out
at
night
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
near
<EOS>
so
unhappy
,
in
spite
of
all
,
as
I
have
be
on
my
first
enlisting
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
at
least
,
think
<EOS>
I
,
if
I
be
degrade
to
be
a
private
soldier
there
will
be
no
one
of
my
acquaintance
who
will
witness
my
shame
;
and
that
be
the
point
which
I
have
always
care
for
most
.
<EOS>
there
will
be
no
one
to
say
,
"
there
be
young
Redmond
Barry
,
the
descendant
or
the
Barrys
,
the
fashionable
young
blood
of
Dublin
,
pipeclaye
his
belt
and
carry
his
brown
Bess
.
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
but
for
that
opinion
of
the
world
,
with
which
it
be
necessary
that
every
man
of
spirit
should
keep
upon
equal
term
,
I
,
for
my
part
,
would
have
always
be
content
with
the
humblest
portion
.
<EOS>
now
here
,
to
all
intent
and
purpose
,
one
be
as
far
remove
from
the
world
as
in
the
wild
of
Siberia
,
or
in
Robinson
Crusoe
's
Island
.
<EOS>
and
I
reason
with
myself
thus
:
 
<EOS>
"
now
you
be
catch
,
there
be
no
use
in
repining
:
make
the
good
of
your
situation
,
and
get
all
the
pleasure
you
can
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
thousand
opportunity
of
plunder
,
&
c.
,
offer
to
the
soldier
in
war
-
time
,
out
of
which
he
can
get
both
pleasure
and
profit
:
make
use
of
these
,
and
be
happy
.
<EOS>
besides
,
you
be
extraordinarily
brave
,
handsome
,
and
clever
:
and
who
know
but
you
may
procure
advancement
in
your
new
service
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
this
philosophical
way
I
look
at
my
misfortune
,
determine
not
to
be
cast
down
by
them
;
and
bore
woe
and
my
broken
head
with
perfect
magnanimity
.
<EOS>
the
latter
be
,
for
the
moment
,
an
evil
against
which
it
require
no
small
power
of
endurance
to
contend
;
for
the
jolt
of
the
waggon
be
dreadful
,
and
every
shake
cause
a
throb
in
my
brain
which
I
think
would
have
split
my
skull
.
<EOS>
as
the
morning
dawn
,
I
see
that
the
man
next
me
,
a
gaunt
yellow
-
haired
creature
,
in
black
,
have
a
cushion
of
straw
under
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
you
wound
,
comrade
?
<EOS>
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
praise
be
the
Lord
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
be
sore
hurt
in
spirit
and
body
,
and
bruise
in
many
member
;
wound
,
however
,
be
I
not
.
<EOS>
and
you
,
poor
youth
?
"
  
"
I
be
wound
in
the
head
,
"
say
I
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
want
your
pillow
:
give
it
me
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
clasp
-
knife
in
my
pocket
!
<EOS>
"
and
with
this
I
give
him
a
terrible
look
,
mean
to
say
(
and
mean
it
<EOS>
I
do
,
for
look
you
,
<EOS>
a
LA
GUERRE
C'EST
a
LA
GUERRE
,
and
I
be
none
of
your
milksop
)
<EOS>
that
,
unless
he
yield
me
the
accommodation
,
I
would
give
him
a
taste
of
my
steel
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
give
it
thee
without
any
threat
,
friend
,
"
say
the
yellow
-
haired
man
meekly
,
and
hand
me
over
his
little
sack
of
straw
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
lean
himself
back
as
comfortably
as
he
could
against
the
cart
,
and
begin
repeat
,
"
Ein
'
feste
Burg
ist
unser
Gott
,
"
by
which
I
conclude
that
I
have
get
into
the
company
of
a
parson
.
<EOS>
with
the
jolt
of
the
waggon
,
and
accident
of
the
journey
,
various
more
exclamation
and
movement
of
the
passenger
show
what
a
motley
company
we
be
.
<EOS>
every
now
and
then
a
countryman
would
burst
into
tear
;
a
french
voice
would
be
hear
to
say
,
"
o
mon
Dieu
!
 
<EOS>
mon
Dieu
!
<EOS>
"
a
couple
more
of
the
same
nation
be
jabber
oath
and
chatter
incessantly
;
and
a
certain
allusion
to
his
own
and
everybody
else
's
eye
,
which
come
from
a
stalwart
figure
at
the
far
corner
,
tell
me
that
there
be
certainly
an
Englishman
in
our
crew
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
spare
soon
the
tedium
and
discomfort
of
the
journey
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
the
clergyman
's
cushion
,
my
head
,
which
be
throb
with
pain
,
be
bring
abruptly
in
contact
with
the
side
of
the
waggon
;
it
begin
to
bleed
afresh
:
I
become
almost
light
-
head
.
<EOS>
I
only
recollect
have
a
draught
of
water
here
and
there
;
once
stop
at
a
fortified
town
,
where
an
officer
count
us
:
 
all
the
rest
of
the
journey
be
pass
in
a
drowsy
stupor
,
from
which
,
when
I
awoke
,
I
find
myself
lie
in
a
hospital
bed
,
with
a
nun
in
a
white
hood
watch
over
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
be
in
sad
spiritual
darkness
,
"
say
a
voice
from
the
bed
next
to
me
,
when
the
nun
have
finish
her
kind
office
and
retire
:
"
they
be
in
the
night
of
error
,
and
yet
there
be
the
light
of
faith
in
those
poor
creature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
my
comrade
of
the
crimp
waggon
,
his
huge
broad
face
loom
out
from
under
a
white
nightcap
,
and
ensconce
in
the
bed
beside
.
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
you
there
,
Herr
Pastor
?
"
say
I.
  
"
only
a
candidate
,
sir

"
answer
the
white
nightcap
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
,
praise
be
Heaven
!
<EOS>
you
have
come
to
.
<EOS>
You
have
have
a
wild
time
of
it
.
<EOS>
You
have
be
talk
in
the
english
language
(
with
which
I
be
acquaint
)
of
Ireland
,
and
a
young
lady
,
and
Mick
,
and
of
another
young
lady
,
and
of
a
house
on
fire
,
and
of
the
British
Grenadiers
,
concern
whom
you
sing
us
part
of
a
ballad
,
and
of
a
number
of
other
matter
appertain
,
no
doubt
,
to
your
personal
history
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
have
be
a
very
strange
one
,
"
say
I
;
"
and
,
perhaps
,
there
be
no
man
in
the
world
,
of
my
birth
,
whose
misfortune
can
at
all
be
compare
to
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
object
to
own
that
I
be
disposed
to
brag
of
my
birth
and
other
acquirement
;
for
I
have
always
find
that
if
a
man
do
not
give
himself
a
good
word
,
his
friend
will
not
do
it
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
"
say
my
fellow
-
patient
,
"
I
have
no
doubt
yours
be
a
strange
tale
,
and
shall
be
glad
to
hear
it
anon
;
but
at
present
you
must
not
be
permit
to
speak
much
,
for
your
fever
have
be
long
,
and
your
exhaustion
great
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
we
?
"
<EOS>
I
ask
;
and
the
candidate
inform
me
that
we
be
in
the
bishopric
and
town
of
Fulda
,
at
present
occupy
by
Prince
Henry
's
troop
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
a
skirmish
with
an
out
-
party
of
French
near
the
town
,
in
which
a
shot
enter
the
waggon
,
the
poor
candidate
have
be
wound
.
  
<EOS>
as
the
reader
know
already
my
history
,
I
will
not
take
the
trouble
to
repeat
it
here
,
or
to
give
the
addition
with
which
I
favour
my
comrade
in
misfortune
.
<EOS>
but
I
confess
that
I
tell
him
ours
be
the
great
family
and
fine
palace
in
Ireland
,
that
we
be
enormously
wealthy
,
related
to
all
the
peerage
descend
from
the
ancient
king
,
&
c.
;
and
,
to
my
surprise
,
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
,
I
find
that
my
interlocutor
know
a
great
deal
more
about
Ireland
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
when
,
for
instance
,
I
speak
of
my
descent
,
    
"
from
which
race
of
king
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
oh
!
"
say
I
(
for
my
memory
for
date
be
never
very
accurate
)
,
"
from
the
old
ancient
king
of
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
can
you
trace
your
origin
to
the
son
Japhet
?
"
say
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
faith
,
I
can
,
"
answer
I
,
"
and
<EOS>
farther
too
,
 
Nebuchadnezzar
,
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
,
"
say
the
candidate
,
smile
,
"
that
you
look
upon
those
legend
with
incredulity
.
<EOS>
these
Partholans
and
Nemedians
,
of
whom
your
writer
fondly
make
mention
,
can
not
be
authentically
vouched
for
in
history
.
<EOS>
nor
do
I
believe
that
we
have
any
more
foundation
for
the
tale
concern
them
,
than
for
the
legend
relative
to
Joseph
of
Arimathea
and
King
Bruce
which
prevail
two
century
back
in
the
sister
island
.
  
<EOS>
and
then
he
begin
a
discourse
about
the
Phoenicians
,
the
Scyths
or
Goths
,
the
Tuath
de
Danans
,
Tacitus
,
and
King
MacNeil
;
<EOS>
which
be
,
to
say
the
truth
,
the
very
first
news
I
have
hear
of
those
personage
.
<EOS>
as
for
English
,
he
speak
it
as
well
as
I
,
and
have
seven
more
language
,
he
say
,
equally
at
his
command
;
for
,
on
my
quote
the
only
latin
line
that
I
know
,
that
out
of
the
poet
Homer
,
which
say
,
       
"
<EOS>
as
in
praesenti
perfectum
fumat
in
avi
,
"
  
he
begin
to
speak
to
me
in
the
roman
tongue
;
on
which
I
be
fain
to
tell
him
that
we
pronounce
it
in
a
different
way
in
Ireland
,
and
so
get
off
the
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
My
honest
friend
's
history
be
a
curious
one
,
and
it
may
be
tell
here
in
order
to
show
of
what
motley
material
<EOS>
our
levy
be
compose
:
    
"
I
be
,
"
say
he
,
"
a
Saxon
by
birth
,
my
father
be
pastor
of
the
village
of
Pfannkuchen
,
where
I
imbibe
the
first
rudiment
of
knowledge
.
<EOS>
at
sixteen
(
I
be
now
twenty
-
three
)
,
have
master
the
greek
and
latin
tongue
,
with
the
French
,
English
,
Arabic
,
and
Hebrew
;
and
have
come
into
possession
of
a
legacy
of
a
hundred
rixdaler
,
a
sum
amply
sufficient
to
defray
my
University
course
,
I
go
to
the
famous
academy
of
Gottingen
,
where
I
devote
four
year
to
the
exact
science
and
theology
.
<EOS>
also
,
I
learn
what
worldly
accomplishment
I
could
command
;
take
a
dancing
-
tutor
at
the
expense
of
a
groschen
a
lesson
,
a
course
of
fence
from
a
french
practitioner
,
and
attend
lecture
on
the
great
horse
and
the
equestrian
science
at
the
hippodrome
of
a
celebrated
cavalry
professor
.
<EOS>
My
opinion
be
,
that
a
man
should
know
everything
as
far
as
in
his
power
lie
:
that
he
should
complete
his
cycle
of
experience
;
and
,
one
science
be
as
necessary
as
another
,
it
behove
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
of
a
saving
turn
,
hence
my
little
fortune
of
a
hundred
rixdaler
,
which
have
serve
to
keep
many
a
prudent
man
for
a
score
of
year
,
barely
suffice
for
five
year
'
study
;
after
which
my
study
be
interrupt
,
my
pupil
fall
off
,
and
I
be
oblige
to
devote
much
time
to
shoe
-
binding
in
order
to
save
money
,
and
,
at
a
future
period
,
resume
my
academic
course
.
<EOS>
during
this
period
I
contract
an
attachment
"
(
here
the
candidate
sigh
a
little
)
"
with
a
person
,
who
,
though
not
beautiful
,
and
forty
year
of
age
,
be
yet
likely
to
sympathise
with
my
existence
;
and
,
a
month
since
,
my
kind
friend
and
patron
,
University
Prorector
Doctor
Nasenbrumm
,
have
inform
me
that
the
Pfarrer
of
Rumpelwitz
be
dead
,
ask
whether
I
would
like
to
have
my
name
place
upon
the
candidate
list
,
and
if
I
be
minded
to
preach
a
trial
sermon
?
<EOS>
as
the
gaining
of
this
live
would
further
my
union
with
my
Amalia
,
I
joyously
consent
,
and
prepare
a
discourse
.
  
<EOS>
"
if
you
like
I
will
recite
it
to
you
 
<EOS>
no
?
 
<EOS>
well
,
I
will
give
you
extract
from
it
upon
our
line
of
march
.
<EOS>
to
proceed
,
then
,
with
my
biographical
sketch
,
which
be
now
very
near
a
conclusion
;
or
,
as
I
should
more
correctly
say
,
which
have
very
nearly
bring
me
to
the
present
period
of
time
:
I
preach
that
sermon
at
Rumpelwitz
,
in
which
I
hope
that
the
babylonian
question
be
pretty
satisfactorily
set
at
rest
.
<EOS>
I
preach
it
before
the
Herr
Baron
and
his
noble
family
,
and
some
officer
of
distinction
who
be
stay
at
his
castle
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Doctor
Moser
of
Halle
follow
me
in
the
evening
discourse
;
but
,
though
his
exercise
be
learn
,
and
he
dispose
of
a
passage
of
Ignatius
,
which
he
prove
to
be
a
manifest
interpolation
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
think
his
sermon
have
the
effect
which
mine
produce
,
and
that
the
Rumpelwitzers
much
relish
it
.
<EOS>
after
the
sermon
,
all
the
candidate
walk
out
of
church
together
,
and
sup
lovingly
at
the
"
Blue
Stag
"
in
Rumpelwitz
.
  
<EOS>
"
while
so
occupied
,
a
waiter
come
in
and
say
that
a
person
without
wish
to
speak
to
one
of
the
reverend
candidate
,
"
the
tall
one
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
could
only
mean
me
,
for
I
be
a
head
and
shoulder
high
than
any
other
reverend
gentleman
present
.
<EOS>
I
issue
out
to
see
who
be
the
person
desire
to
hold
converse
with
me
,
and
find
a
man
whom
I
have
no
difficulty
in
recognise
as
one
of
the
jewish
persuasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Sir
,
"
say
this
Hebrew
,
"
I
have
hear
from
a
friend
,
who
be
in
your
church
to
-
day
,
the
head
of
the
admirable
discourse
you
pronounce
there
.
<EOS>
It
have
affect
me
deeply
,
most
deeply
.
<EOS>
there
be
only
one
or
two
point
on
which
I
be
yet
in
doubt
,
and
if
your
honour
could
but
condescend
to
enlighten
me
on
these
,
I
think
 
I
think
Solomon
Hirsch
would
be
a
convert
to
your
eloquence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
what
be
these
point
,
my
good
friend
?
"
say
I
;
and
I
point
out
to
him
the
twenty
-
four
head
of
my
sermon
,
ask
him
in
which
of
these
his
doubt
lie
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
be
walk
up
and
down
before
the
inn
while
our
conversation
take
place
,
but
the
window
be
open
,
and
my
comrade
have
hear
the
discourse
in
the
morning
,
request
me
,
rather
peevishly
,
not
to
resume
it
at
that
period
.
<EOS>
I
,
therefore
,
move
on
with
my
disciple
,
and
,
at
his
request
,
begin
at
once
the
sermon
;
for
my
memory
be
good
for
anything
,
and
I
can
repeat
any
book
I
have
read
thrice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
pour
out
,
then
,
under
the
tree
,
and
in
the
calm
moonlight
,
that
discourse
which
I
have
pronounce
under
the
blaze
sun
of
noon
.
<EOS>
My
Israelite
only
interrupt
me
by
exclamation
indicative
of
surprise
,
assent
,
admiration
,
and
increase
conviction
.
<EOS>
"
prodigious
!
"
say
he
;
 
"
Wunderschon
!
"
<EOS>
would
he
remark
at
the
conclusion
of
some
eloquent
passage
;
in
a
word
,
he
exhaust
the
complimentary
interjection
of
our
language
:
and
to
compliment
what
man
be
averse
?
<EOS>
I
think
we
must
have
walk
two
mile
when
I
get
to
my
third
head
and
my
companion
beg
I
would
enter
his
house
,
which
we
now
near
,
and
partake
of
a
glass
of
beer
;
to
which
I
be
never
averse

<EOS>
"
that
house
,
sir

be
the
inn
at
which
you
,
too

if
I
judge
aright

<EOS>
no

three

rush
upon

tell
me
I
be
a
deserter

their
prisoner

and
call
upon
me
to
deliver
up
my
money
and
paper
;
which
I
do
with
a
solemn
protest
as
to
my
sacred
character

<EOS>
They

declare
his

but
he
be

I
believe
it
be
some
affair
of
love
with
a
hessian

which
cause
him

as
the
person
into

<EOS>
"
I
be

and
there
be
no
use

indignation

<EOS>
Our
government
be
crush
under
Frederick

heel
these
five
year
,
and
I
may
as
well
hope
for
mercy
from
the
Grand
Mogul

<EOS>
nor
be
I
,
in
truth
,
discontent
with
my
lot
;
I
have
live
on
a
penny
bread
for
so
many
year
,
that
a
soldier
's
ration
will
be
a
luxury
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
about
more
or
less
blow
of
a
cane
;
all
such
evil
be
pass
,
and
therefore
endurable
.
<EOS>
I
will
never
,
God
willing
,
slay
a
man
in
combat
;
but
I
be
not
unanxious
to
experience
on
myself
the
effect
of
the
war
-
passion
,
which
have
have
so
great
an
influence
on
the
human
race
.
<EOS>
It
be
for
the
same
reason
that
I
determine
to
marry
Amalia
,
for
a
man
be
not
a
complete
Mensch
until
he
be
the
father
of
a
family
;
to
be
which
be
a
condition
of
his
existence
,
and
therefore
a
duty
of
his
education
.
<EOS>
Amalia
must
wait
;
she
be
out
of
the
reach
of
want
,
be
,
indeed
,
cook
to
the
Frau
Prorectorinn
Nasenbrumm
,
my
worthy
patron
's
lady
.
<EOS>
I
have
one
or
two
book
with
me
,
which
no
one
be
likely
to
take
from
me
,
and
one
in
my
heart
which
be
the
good
of
all
.
<EOS>
if
it
shall
please
Heaven
to
finish
my
existence
here
,
before
I
can
prosecute
my
study
further
,
what
cause
have
I
to
repine
?
<EOS>
I
pray
God
<EOS>
I
may
not
be
mistaken
,
but
I
think
I
have
wrong
no
man
,
and
commit
no
mortal
sin
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
,
I
know
where
to
look
for
forgiveness
;
and
if
I
die
,
as
I
have
say
,
without
know
all
that
I
would
desire
to
learn
,
shall
I
not
be
in
a
situation
to
learn
everything
,
and
what
can
human
soul
ask
for
more
?
  
<EOS>
"
pardon
me
for
put
so
many
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
be
in
my
discourse
,
"
say
the
candidate
,
"
but
when
a
man
be
talk
of
himself
,
'
tis
the
brief
and
simple
way
of
talk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
in
which
,
perhaps
,
though
I
hate
egotism
,
I
think
my
friend
be
right
.
<EOS>
although
he
acknowledge
himself
to
be
a
mean
-
spirited
fellow
,
with
no
more
ambition
than
to
know
the
content
of
a
few
musty
book
,
I
think
the
man
have
some
good
in
him
;
especially
in
the
resolution
with
which
he
bear
his
calamity
.
<EOS>
many
a
gallant
man
of
the
high
honour
be
often
not
proof
against
these
,
and
have
be
know
to
despair
over
a
bad
dinner
,
or
to
be
cast
down
at
a
ragged
-
elbowed
coat
.
<EOS>
my
maxim
be
to
bear
all
,
to
put
up
with
water
if
you
can
not
get
Burgundy
,
and
if
you
have
no
velvet
to
be
content
with
frieze
.
<EOS>
but
Burgundy
and
velvet
be
the
good
,
bien
entendu
,
and
the
man
be
a
fool
who
will
not
seize
the
good
when
the
scramble
be
open
.
  
<EOS>
the
head
of
the
sermon
which
my
friend
the
theologian
intend
to
impart
to
me
,
be
,
however
,
never
tell
;
for
,
after
our
come
out
of
the
hospital
,
he
be
draft
into
a
regiment
quarter
as
far
as
possible
from
his
native
country
,
in
Pomerania
;
while
I
be
put
into
the
Bulow
regiment
,
of
which
the
ordinary
headquarters
be
Berlin
.
<EOS>
the
prussian
regiment
seldom
change
their
garrison
as
our
do
,
for
the
fear
of
desertion
be
so
great
,
that
it
become
necessary
to
know
the
face
of
every
individual
in
the
service
;
and
,
in
time
of
peace
,
man
live
and
die
in
the
same
town
.
<EOS>
this
do
not
add
,
as
may
be
imagine
,
to
the
amusement
of
the
soldier
's
life
.
<EOS>
It
be
lest
any
young
gentleman
like
myself
should
take
a
fancy
to
a
military
career
,
and
fancy
that
of
a
private
soldier
a
tolerable
one
,
that
I
be
give
these
,
I
hope
,
moral
description
of
what
we
poor
fellow
in
the
rank
really
suffer
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
we
recover
,
we
be
dismiss
from
the
nun
and
the
hospital
to
the
town
prison
of
Fulda
,
where
we
be
keep
like
slave
and
criminal
,
with
artillerymen
with
light
match
at
the
door
of
the
courtyard
and
the
huge
black
dormitory
where
some
hundred
of
us
lie
;
until
we
be
despatch
to
our
different
destination
.
<EOS>
It
be
soon
see
by
the
exercise
which
be
the
old
soldier
amongst
us
,
and
which
the
recruit
;
and
for
the
former
,
while
we
lay
in
prison
,
there
be
a
little
more
leisure
:
<EOS>
though
,
if
possible
,
a
still
more
strict
watch
keep
than
over
the
break
-
spirited
yokel
who
have
be
force
or
coax
into
the
service
.
<EOS>
to
describe
the
character
here
assemble
would
require
Mr.
Gilray
's
own
pencil
.
<EOS>
there
be
man
of
all
nation
and
calling
.
<EOS>
the
Englishmen
box
and
bully
;
the
Frenchmen
play
card
,
and
dance
,
and
fence
;
the
heavy
Germans
smoke
their
pipe
and
drink
beer
,
if
they
could
manage
to
purchase
it
.
<EOS>
those
who
have
anything
to
risk
gamble
,
and
at
this
sport
I
be
pretty
lucky
,
for
,
not
have
a
penny
when
I
enter
the
depot
(
have
be
rob
of
every
farthing
of
my
property
by
the
rascally
crimp
)
<EOS>
,
I
win
near
a
dollar
in
my
very
first
game
at
card
with
one
of
the
Frenchmen
;
who
do
not
think
of
ask
whether
I
could
pay
or
not
upon
lose
.
<EOS>
such
,
at
least
,
be
the
advantage
of
have
a
gentlemanlike
appearance
;
it
have
save
me
many
a
time
since
by
procure
me
credit
when
my
fortune
be
at
their
low
ebb
.
  
<EOS>
among
the
Frenchmen
there
be
a
splendid
man
and
soldier
,
whose
real
name
we
never
know
,
but
whose
ultimate
history
create
no
small
sensation
,
when
it
come
to
be
know
in
the
prussian
army
.
<EOS>
if
beauty
and
courage
be
proof
of
nobility
,
as
(
although
I
have
see
some
of
the
ugly
dog
and
the
great
coward
in
the
world
in
the
noblesse
)
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
courage
and
beauty
be
,
<EOS>
this
Frenchman
must
have
be
of
the
high
family
in
France
,
so
grand
and
noble
be
his
manner
,
so
superb
his
person
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
quite
so
tall
as
myself
,
fair
,
while
I
be
dark
,
and
,
if
possible
,
rather
broad
in
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
only
man
I
ever
meet
who
could
master
me
with
the
small
-
sword
;
with
which
he
would
pink
me
four
time
to
my
three
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
sabre
,
I
could
knock
him
to
piece
with
it
;
and
I
could
leap
farther
and
carry
more
than
he
could
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
be
mere
egotism
.
<EOS>
this
Frenchman
,
with
whom
I
become
pretty
intimate
 
<EOS>
for
we
be
the
two
cock
,
as
it
be
,
of
the
depot
,
and
neither
have
any
feeling
of
low
jealousy
 
be
call
,
for
want
of
a
well
name
,
Le
Blondin
,
on
account
of
his
complexion
.
<EOS>
He
be
not
a
deserter
,
but
have
come
in
from
the
Lower
Rhine
and
the
bishopric
,
as
I
fancy
;
fortune
have
prove
unfavourable
to
him
at
play
probably
,
and
other
mean
of
existence
be
deny
him
.
<EOS>
I
suspect
that
the
Bastile
be
wait
for
him
in
his
own
country
,
have
he
take
a
fancy
to
return
thither
.
  
<EOS>
He
be
passionately
fond
of
play
and
liquor
,
and
thus
we
have
a
considerable
sympathy
together
:
when
excite
by
one
or
the
other
,
he
become
frightful
.
<EOS>
I
,
for
my
part
,
can
bear
,
without
wince
,
both
ill
luck
and
wine
;
hence
my
advantage
over
him
be
considerable
in
our
bout
,
and
I
win
enough
money
from
him
to
make
my
position
tenable
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
wife
outside
(
who
,
I
take
it
,
be
the
cause
of
his
misfortune
and
separation
from
his
family
)
,
and
she
use
to
be
admit
to
see
him
twice
or
thrice
a
week
,
and
never
come
empty
-
handed
 
a
little
brown
bright
-
eyed
creature
,
whose
ogle
have
make
the
great
impression
upon
all
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
this
man
be
draft
into
a
regiment
that
be
quarter
at
Neiss
in
Silesia
,
which
be
only
at
a
short
distance
from
the
austrian
frontier
;
he
maintain
always
the
same
character
for
daring
and
skill
,
and
be
,
in
the
secret
republic
of
the
regiment
 
which
always
exist
as
well
as
the
regular
military
hierarchy
 
the
acknowledge
leader
.
<EOS>
He
be
an
admirable
soldier
,
as
I
have
say
;
but
haughty
,
dissolute
,
and
a
drunkard
.
<EOS>
a
man
of
this
mark
,
unless
he
take
care
to
coax
and
flatter
his
officer
(
which
I
always
do
)
,
be
sure
to
fall
out
with
them
.
<EOS>
Le
Blondin
's
captain
be
his
swear
enemy
,
and
his
punishment
be
frequent
and
severe
.
  
<EOS>
His
wife
and
the
woman
of
the
regiment
(
this
be
after
the
peace
)
use
to
carry
on
a
little
commerce
of
smuggling
across
the
austrian
frontier
,
where
their
dealing
be
wink
at
by
both
party
;
and
in
obedience
to
the
instruction
of
her
husband
,
this
woman
,
from
every
one
of
her
excursion
,
would
bring
in
a
little
powder
and
ball
:
commodity
which
be
not
to
be
procure
by
the
prussian
soldier
,
and
which
be
stow
away
in
secret
till
want
.
<EOS>
They
be
to
be
want
,
and
that
soon
.
  
<EOS>
Le
Blondin
have
organise
a
great
and
extraordinary
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
know
how
far
it
go
,
how
many
hundred
or
thousand
it
embrace
;
but
strange
be
the
story
tell
about
the
plot
amongst
us
privates
:
<EOS>
for
the
news
be
spread
from
garrison
to
garrison
,
and
talk
of
by
the
army
,
in
spite
of
all
the
Government
effort
to
hush
it
up
 
hush
it
up
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
have
be
of
the
people
myself
;
I
have
see
the
irish
rebellion
,
and
I
know
what
be
the
free
-
masonry
of
the
poor
.
  
<EOS>
He
make
himself
the
head
of
the
plot
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
writing
nor
paper
.
<EOS>
no
single
one
of
the
conspirator
communicate
with
any
other
than
the
Frenchman
;
but
personally
he
give
his
order
to
them
all
.
<EOS>
He
have
arrange
matter
for
a
general
rise
of
the
garrison
,
at
twelve
o'clock
on
a
certain
day
:
the
guard
-
house
in
the
town
be
to
be
seize
,
the
sentinel
cut
down
,
and
 
who
know
the
rest
?
<EOS>
some
of
our
people
use
to
say
that
the
conspiracy
be
spread
through
all
Silesia
,
and
that
Le
Blondin
be
to
be
make
a
general
in
the
austrian
service
.
  
<EOS>
at
twelve
o'clock
,
and
opposite
the
guard
-
house
by
the
Bohmer
-
Thor
of
Neiss
,
some
thirty
man
be
lounge
about
in
their
undress
,
and
the
Frenchman
stand
near
the
sentinel
of
the
guard
-
house
,
sharpen
a
wood
hatchet
on
a
stone
.
<EOS>
at
the
stroke
of
twelve
,
he
get
up
,
split
open
the
sentinel
's
head
with
a
blow
of
his
axe
,
and
the
thirty
man
,
rush
into
the
guard
-
house
,
take
possession
of
the
arm
there
,
and
march
at
once
to
the
gate
.
<EOS>
the
sentry
there
try
to
drop
the
bar
,
but
the
Frenchman
rush
up
to
him
,
and
,
with
another
blow
of
the
axe
,
cut
off
his
right
hand
,
with
which
he
hold
the
chain
.
<EOS>
see
the
man
rush
out
armed
,
the
guard
without
the
gate
draw
up
across
the
road
to
prevent
their
passage
;
but
the
Frenchman
's
thirty
give
them
a
volley
,
charge
them
with
the
bayonet
,
and
bring
down
several
,
and
the
rest
flying
,
the
thirty
rush
on
.
<EOS>
the
frontier
be
only
a
league
from
Neiss
,
and
they
make
rapidly
towards
it
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
alarm
be
give
in
the
town
,
and
what
save
it
be
that
the
clock
by
which
the
Frenchman
go
be
a
quarter
of
an
hour
faster
than
any
of
the
clock
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
the
generale
be
beat
,
the
troop
call
to
arm
,
and
thus
the
man
who
be
to
have
attack
the
other
guard
-
house
,
be
oblige
to
fall
into
the
rank
,
and
their
project
be
defeat
.
<EOS>
this
,
however
,
likewise
render
the
discovery
of
the
conspirator
impossible
,
for
no
man
could
betray
his
comrade
,
nor
,
of
course
,
would
he
criminate
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Cavalry
be
send
in
pursuit
of
the
Frenchman
and
his
thirty
fugitive
,
who
be
,
by
this
time
,
far
on
their
way
to
the
bohemian
frontier
.
<EOS>
when
the
horse
come
up
with
them
,
they
turn
,
receive
them
with
a
volley
and
the
bayonet
,
and
drive
them
back
.
<EOS>
the
Austrians
be
out
at
the
barrier
,
look
eagerly
on
at
the
conflict
.
<EOS>
the
woman
,
who
be
on
the
look
-
out
too
,
bring
more
ammunition
to
these
intrepid
deserter
,
and
they
engage
and
drive
back
the
dragoon
several
time
.
<EOS>
but
in
these
gallant
and
fruitless
combat
much
time
be
lose
,
and
a
battalion
presently
come
up
,
and
surround
the
brave
thirty
;
when
the
fate
of
the
poor
fellow
be
decide
.
<EOS>
They
fight
with
the
fury
of
despair
:
not
one
of
them
ask
for
quarter
.
<EOS>
when
their
ammunition
fail
,
they
fight
with
the
steel
,
and
be
shoot
down
or
bayonet
where
they
stand
.
<EOS>
the
Frenchman
be
the
very
last
man
who
be
hit
.
<EOS>
He
receive
a
bullet
in
the
thigh
,
and
fall
,
and
in
this
state
be
overpower
,
kill
the
officer
who
first
advance
to
seize
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
and
the
very
few
of
his
comrade
who
survive
be
carry
back
to
Neiss
,
and
immediately
,
as
the
ringleader
,
he
be
bring
before
a
council
of
war
.
<EOS>
He
refuse
all
interrogation
which
be
make
as
to
his
real
name
and
family
.
<EOS>
"
what
matter
who
I
be
?
"
say
he
;
"
you
have
me
and
will
shoot
me
.
<EOS>
My
name
would
not
save
me
be
it
ever
so
famous
.
<EOS>
"
in
the
same
way
he
decline
to
make
a
single
discovery
regard
the
plot
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
all
my
doing
,
"
he
say
;
"
each
man
engage
in
it
only
know
me
,
and
be
ignorant
of
every
one
of
his
comrade
.
<EOS>
the
secret
be
mine
alone
,
and
the
secret
shall
die
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
when
the
officer
ask
him
what
be
the
reason
which
induce
him
to
meditate
a
crime
so
horrible
?
 
<EOS>
"
It
be
your
infernal
brutality
and
tyranny
,
"
he
say
.
<EOS>
"
You
be
all
butcher
,
ruffian
,
tiger
,
and
you
owe
it
to
the
cowardice
of
your
man
that
you
be
not
murder
long
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
at
this
his
captain
burst
into
the
most
furious
exclamation
against
the
wounded
man
,
and
rush
up
to
him
,
strike
him
a
blow
with
his
fist
.
<EOS>
but
Le
Blondin
,
wound
as
he
be
,
as
quick
as
thought
seize
the
bayonet
of
one
of
the
soldier
who
support
him
,
and
plunge
it
into
the
officer
's
breast
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Scoundrel
and
monster
,
"
say
he
,
"
I
shall
have
the
consolation
of
send
you
out
of
the
world
before
I
die
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
shoot
that
day
.
<EOS>
He
offer
to
write
to
the
King
,
if
the
officer
would
agree
to
let
his
letter
go
seal
into
the
hand
of
the
postmaster
;
but
they
fear
,
no
doubt
,
that
something
may
be
say
to
inculpate
themselves
,
and
refuse
him
the
permission
.
<EOS>
at
the
next
review
Frederick
treat
them
,
it
be
say
,
with
great
severity
,
and
rebuke
them
for
not
have
grant
the
Frenchman
his
request
.
<EOS>
however
,
it
be
the
King
's
interest
to
conceal
the
matter
,
and
so
it
be
,
as
I
have
say
before
,
hush
up
 
<EOS>
so
well
hush
up
,
that
a
hundred
thousand
soldier
in
the
army
know
it
;
and
many
be
the
one
of
us
that
have
drunk
to
the
Frenchman
's
memory
over
our
wine
,
as
a
martyr
for
the
cause
of
the
soldier
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
,
doubtless
,
some
reader
who
will
cry
out
at
this
,
that
I
be
encourage
insubordination
and
advocate
murder
.
<EOS>
if
these
man
have
serve
as
private
in
the
prussian
army
from
1760
to
1765
,
they
would
not
be
so
apt
to
take
objection
.
<EOS>
this
man
destroy
two
sentinel
to
get
his
liberty
;
how
many
hundred
of
thousand
of
his
own
and
the
austrian
people
do
King
Frederick
kill
because
he
take
a
fancy
to
Silesia
?
<EOS>
It
be
the
accurse
tyranny
of
the
system
that
sharpen
the
axe
which
brain
the
two
sentinel
of
Neiss
:
<EOS>
and
so
let
officer
take
warning
,
and
think
twice
ere
they
visit
poor
fellow
with
the
cane
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
tell
many
more
story
about
the
army
;
but
as
,
from
have
be
a
soldier
myself
,
all
my
sympathy
be
in
the
rank
,
no
doubt
my
tale
would
be
pronounce
to
be
of
an
immoral
tendency
,
and
I
have
good
,
therefore
,
be
brief
.
<EOS>
fancy
my
surprise
while
in
this
depot
,
when
one
day
a
well
-
know
voice
salute
my
ear
,
and
I
hear
a
meagre
young
gentleman
,
who
be
bring
in
by
a
couple
of
trooper
and
receive
a
few
cut
across
the
shoulder
from
one
of
them
,
say
in
the
good
English
,
"
You
infernal
WASCAL
,
I
will
be
wevenge
for
this
.
<EOS>
I
will
wite
to
my
ambassador
,
as
sure
as
my
name
's
Fakenham
of
Fakenham
.
<EOS>
"
I
burst
out
laugh
at
this
:
it
be
my
old
acquaintance
in
my
corporal
's
coat
.
<EOS>
Lischen
have
swear
stoutly
,
that
he
be
really
and
truly
the
private
,
and
the
poor
fellow
have
be
draft
off
,
and
be
to
be
make
one
of
us
.
<EOS>
but
I
bear
no
malice
,
and
have
make
the
whole
room
roar
with
the
story
of
the
way
in
which
I
have
trick
the
poor
lad
,
I
give
him
a
piece
of
advice
,
which
procure
him
his
liberty
.
<EOS>
"
go
to
the
inspect
officer
,
"
say
I
;
"
if
they
once
get
you
into
Prussia
it
be
all
over
with
you
,
and
they
will
never
give
you
up
.
<EOS>
go
now
to
the
commandant
of
the
depot
,
promise
him
a
hundred
 
five
hundred
guinea
to
set
you
free
;
say
that
the
crimp
captain
have
your
paper
and
portfolio
"
(
this
be
true
)
;
"
above
all
,
show
him
that
you
have
the
mean
of
pay
him
the
promised
money
,
and
I
will
warrant
you
be
set
free
.
"
<EOS>
He
do
as
I
advise
,
and
when
we
be
put
on
the
march
Mr.
Fakenham
find
mean
to
be
allow
to
go
into
hospital
,
and
while
in
hospital
the
matter
be
arrange
as
I
have
recommend
.
<EOS>
He
have
nearly
,
however
,
miss
his
freedom
by
his
own
stinginess
in
bargaining
for
it
,
and
never
show
the
least
gratitude
towards
me
his
benefactor
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
go
to
give
any
romantic
narrative
of
the
Seven
year
'
war
.
<EOS>
at
the
close
of
it
,
the
prussian
army
,
so
renowned
for
its
disciplined
valour
,
be
officer
and
under
-
officer
by
native
Prussians
,
it
be
true
;
but
be
compose
for
the
most
part
of
man
hire
or
steal
,
like
myself
,
from
almost
every
nation
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
the
deserting
to
and
fro
be
prodigious
.
<EOS>
in
my
regiment
(
Bulow
's
)
alone
before
the
war
,
there
have
be
no
less
than
600
Frenchmen
,
and
as
they
march
out
of
Berlin
for
the
campaign
,
one
of
the
fellow
have
an
old
fiddle
on
which
he
be
flay
a
french
tune
,
and
his
comrade
dance
almost
,
rather
than
walk
,
after
him
,
singe
,
"
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
two
year
after
,
when
they
return
to
Berlin
,
there
be
only
six
of
these
man
leave
;
the
rest
have
flee
or
be
kill
in
action
.
<EOS>
the
life
the
private
soldier
lead
be
a
frightful
one
to
any
but
man
of
iron
courage
and
endurance
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
corporal
to
every
three
man
,
march
behind
them
,
and
pitilessly
use
the
cane
;
so
much
so
that
it
use
to
be
say
that
in
action
there
be
a
front
rank
of
private
and
a
second
rank
of
sergeant
and
corporal
to
drive
them
on
.
<EOS>
many
man
would
give
way
to
the
most
frightful
act
of
despair
under
these
incessant
persecution
and
torture
;
and
amongst
several
regiment
of
the
army
a
horrible
practice
have
spring
up
,
which
for
some
time
cause
the
great
alarm
to
the
Government
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
strange
frightful
custom
of
CHILD
-
MURDER
.
<EOS>
the
man
use
to
say
that
life
be
unbearable
,
that
suicide
be
a
crime
;
in
order
to
avert
which
,
and
to
finish
with
the
intolerable
misery
of
their
position
,
the
good
plan
be
to
kill
a
young
child
,
which
be
innocent
,
and
therefore
secure
of
heaven
,
and
then
to
deliver
themselves
up
as
guilty
of
the
murder
.
<EOS>
the
King
himself
 
the
hero
,
sage
,
and
philosopher
,
the
prince
who
have
always
liberality
on
his
lip
and
who
affect
a
horror
of
capital
punishment
 
be
frighten
at
this
dreadful
protest
,
on
the
part
of
the
wretch
whom
he
have
kidnap
,
against
his
monstrous
tyranny
;
but
his
only
mean
of
remedy
the
evil
be
strictly
to
forbid
that
such
criminal
should
be
attend
by
any
ecclesiastic
whatever
,
and
deny
all
religious
consolation
.
  
<EOS>
the
punishment
be
incessant
.
<EOS>
every
officer
have
the
liberty
to
inflict
it
,
and
in
peace
it
be
more
cruel
than
in
war
.
<EOS>
for
when
peace
come
the
King
turn
adrift
such
of
his
officer
as
be
not
noble
;
whatever
their
service
may
have
be
.
<EOS>
He
would
call
a
captain
to
the
front
of
his
company
and
say
,
"
He
be
not
noble
,
let
him
go
.
<EOS>
"
We
be
afraid
of
him
somehow
,
and
be
cow
before
him
like
wild
beast
before
their
keeper
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
the
brave
man
of
the
army
cry
like
child
at
a
cut
of
the
cane
;
I
have
see
a
little
ensign
of
fifteen
call
out
a
man
of
fifty
from
the
rank
,
a
man
who
have
be
in
a
hundred
battle
,
and
he
have
stand
present
arm
,
and
sobbing
and
howl
like
a
baby
,
while
the
young
wretch
lash
him
over
the
arm
and
thigh
with
the
stick
.
<EOS>
in
a
day
of
action
this
man
would
dare
anything
.
<EOS>
a
button
may
be
awry
then
and
nobody
touch
him
;
but
when
they
have
make
the
brute
fight
,
then
they
lash
him
again
into
subordination
.
<EOS>
almost
all
of
us
yield
to
the
spell
 
scarce
one
could
break
it
.
<EOS>
the
french
officer
I
have
speak
of
as
take
along
with
me
,
be
in
my
company
,
and
cane
like
a
dog
.
<EOS>
I
meet
him
at
Versailles
twenty
year
afterwards
,
and
he
turn
quite
pale
and
sick
when
I
speak
to
him
of
old
day
.
<EOS>
"
for
God
's
sake
,
"
say
he
,
"
do
not
talk
of
that
time

I
wake
up
from
my
sleep
tremble
and
cry
even
now

as
for
me
,
after
a
very
brief
time
(
in
which
it
must
be
confess
I
taste
,
like
my
comrade
,
of
the
cane
)
<EOS>
and
after
I
have
find
opportunity
to
show
myself
to
be
a
brave
and
dexterous
soldier
<EOS>
,
I
take
the
mean
I
have
adopt
in
the
english
army
to
prevent
any
further
personal
degradation
.
<EOS>
I
wear
a
bullet
around
my
neck
,
which
I
do
not
take
the
pain
to
conceal
,
and
I
give
out
that
it
should
be
for
the
man
or
officer
who
cause
me
to
be
chastise
.
<EOS>
and
there
be
something
in
my
character
which
make
my
superior
believe
me
;
for
that
bullet
have
already
serve
me
to
kill
an
austrian
colonel
,
and
I
would
have
give
it
to
a
Prussian
with
as
little
remorse
.
<EOS>
for
what
care
I
for
their
quarrel
,
or
whether
the
eagle
under
which
I
march
have
one
head
or
two
?
<EOS>
all
I
say
be
,
"
no
man
shall
find
me
trip
in
my
duty
;
but
no
man
shall
ever
lay
a
hand
upon
me
.
"
<EOS>
and
by
this
maxim
I
abide
as
long
as
I
remain
in
the
service
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
intend
to
make
a
history
of
battle
in
the
Prussian
any
more
than
in
the
english
service
.
<EOS>
I
do
my
duty
in
them
as
well
as
another
,
and
by
the
time
that
my
moustache
have
grow
to
a
decent
length
,
which
it
do
when
I
be
twenty
year
of
age
,
there
be
not
a
braver
,
cleverer
,
handsomer
,
and
I
must
own
,
wickeder
soldier
in
the
prussian
army
.
<EOS>
I
have
form
myself
to
the
condition
of
the
proper
fighting
beast
;
on
a
day
of
action
I
be
savage
and
happy
;
out
of
the
field
I
take
all
the
pleasure
I
could
get
,
and
be
by
no
means
delicate
as
to
its
quality
or
the
manner
of
procure
it
.
<EOS>
the
truth
be
,
however
,
that
there
be
among
our
man
a
much
high
tone
of
society
than
among
the
clumsy
lout
in
the
english
army
,
and
our
service
be
generally
so
strict
that
we
have
little
time
for
do
mischief
.
<EOS>
I
be
very
dark
and
swarthy
in
complexion
,
and
be
call
by
our
fellow
the
"
Black
Englander
,
"
the
"
Schwartzer
Englander
,
"
or
the
English
Devil
.
<EOS>
if
any
service
be
to
be
do
,
I
be
sure
to
be
put
upon
it
.
<EOS>
I
get
frequent
gratification
of
money
,
but
no
promotion
;
and
it
be
on
the
day
after
I
have
kill
the
austrian
colonel
(
a
great
officer
of
Uhlans
,
whom
I
engage
 
singly
and
on
foot
)
that
General
Bulow
,
my
colonel
,
give
me
two
Frederics
-
d'or
in
front
of
the
regiment
,
and
say
,
"
I
reward
thee
now
;
<EOS>
but
I
fear
I
shall
have
to
hang
thee
one
day
or
other
.
<EOS>
"
I
spend
the
money
,
and
that
I
have
take
from
the
colonel
's
body
,
every
groschen
,
that
night
with
some
jovial
companion
;
but
as
long
as
war
last
be
never
without
a
dollar
in
my
purse
.
   
<EOS>
BARRY
lead
a
garrison
life
,
and
find
many
friend
<EOS>
there
 
<EOS>
after
the
war
our
regiment
be
garrison
in
the
capital
,
the
least
dull
,
perhaps
,
of
all
the
town
of
Prussia
:
but
that
do
not
say
much
for
its
gaiety
.
<EOS>
Our
service
,
which
be
always
severe
,
still
leave
many
hour
of
the
day
disengage
,
in
which
we
may
take
our
pleasure
have
we
the
mean
of
pay
for
the
same
.
<EOS>
many
of
our
mess
get
leave
to
work
in
trade
;
but
I
have
be
bring
up
to
none
:
and
besides
,
my
honour
forbid
me
;
for
as
a
gentleman
,
I
could
not
soil
my
finger
by
a
manual
occupation
.
<EOS>
but
our
pay
be
barely
enough
to
keep
us
from
starve
;
and
as
I
have
always
be
fond
of
pleasure
,
and
as
the
position
in
which
we
now
be
,
in
the
midst
of
the
capital
,
prevent
us
from
resort
to
those
mean
of
levy
contribution
which
be
always
pretty
feasible
in
wartime
,
I
be
oblige
to
adopt
the
only
mean
leave
me
of
provide
for
my
expense
:
and
in
a
word
become
the
ORDONNANZ
,
or
confidential
military
gentleman
,
of
my
captain
.
<EOS>
I
spurn
the
office
four
year
previously
,
when
it
be
make
to
me
in
the
english
service
;
but
the
position
be
very
different
in
a
foreign
country
;
besides
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
after
five
year
in
the
rank
,
a
man
's
pride
will
submit
to
many
rebuff
which
would
be
intolerable
to
him
in
an
independent
condition
.
  
<EOS>
the
captain
be
a
young
man
and
have
distinguish
himself
during
the
war
,
or
he
would
never
have
be
advance
to
rank
so
early
.
<EOS>
He
be
,
moreover
,
the
nephew
and
heir
of
the
Minister
of
Police
,
Monsieur
de
Potzdorff
,
a
relationship
which
no
doubt
aid
in
the
young
gentleman
's
promotion
.
<EOS>
Captain
de
Potzdorff
be
a
severe
officer
enough
on
parade
or
in
barrack
,
but
he
be
a
person
easily
lead
by
flattery
.
<EOS>
I
win
his
heart
in
the
first
place
by
my
manner
of
tie
my
hair
in
queue
(
indeed
,
it
be
more
neatly
dress
than
that
of
any
man
in
the
regiment
)
,
and
subsequently
gain
his
confidence
by
a
thousand
little
art
and
compliment
,
which
as
a
gentleman
myself
I
know
how
to
employ
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
of
pleasure
,
which
he
pursue
more
openly
than
most
man
in
the
stern
Court
of
the
King
;
he
be
generous
and
careless
with
his
purse
,
and
he
have
a
great
affection
for
Rhine
wine
:
in
all
which
quality
I
sincerely
sympathise
with
him
;
and
from
which
I
,
of
course
,
have
my
profit
.
<EOS>
He
be
dislike
in
the
regiment
,
because
he
be
suppose
to
have
too
intimate
relation
with
his
uncle
the
Police
Minister
;
to
whom
,
it
be
hint
,
he
carry
the
news
of
the
corp
.
  
<EOS>
before
long
I
have
ingratiate
myself
considerably
with
my
officer
,
and
know
most
of
his
affair
.
<EOS>
thus
I
be
relieve
from
many
drill
and
parade
,
which
would
otherwise
have
fall
to
my
lot
,
and
come
in
for
a
number
of
perquisite
;
which
enable
me
to
support
a
genteel
figure
and
to
appear
with
some
ECLAT
in
a
certain
,
though
it
must
be
confess
very
humble
,
society
in
Berlin
.
<EOS>
among
the
lady
I
be
always
an
especial
favourite
,
and
so
polished
be
my
behaviour
amongst
them
,
that
they
could
not
understand
how
I
should
have
obtain
my
frightful
nickname
of
the
Black
Devil
in
the
regiment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
be
not
so
black
as
he
be
paint
,
"
I
laughingly
would
say
;
and
most
of
the
lady
agree
that
the
private
be
quite
as
well
-
breed
as
the
captain
:
as
indeed
how
should
it
be
otherwise
,
consider
my
education
and
birth
?
  
<EOS>
when
I
be
sufficiently
ingratiate
with
him
,
I
ask
leave
to
address
a
letter
to
my
poor
mother
in
Ireland
,
to
whom
I
have
not
give
any
news
of
myself
for
many
many
year
;
for
the
letter
of
the
foreign
soldier
be
never
admit
to
the
post
,
for
fear
of
appeal
or
disturbance
on
the
part
of
their
parent
abroad
.
<EOS>
My
captain
agree
to
find
mean
to
forward
the
letter
,
and
as
I
know
that
he
would
open
it
,
I
take
care
to
give
it
him
unsealed
;
thus
show
my
confidence
in
him
.
<EOS>
but
the
letter
be
,
as
you
may
imagine
,
write
so
that
the
writer
should
come
to
no
harm
be
it
intercept
.
<EOS>
I
beg
my
honoured
mother
's
forgiveness
for
have
flee
from
her
;
I
say
that
my
extravagance
and
folly
in
my
own
country
I
know
render
my
return
thither
impossible
;
but
that
she
would
,
at
least
,
be
glad
to
know
that
I
be
well
and
happy
in
the
service
of
the
great
monarch
in
the
world
,
and
that
the
soldier
's
life
be
most
agreeable
to
me
:
and
,
I
add
,
that
I
have
find
a
kind
protector
and
patron
,
who
I
hope
would
some
day
provide
for
me
as
I
know
it
be
out
of
her
power
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
offer
remembrance
to
all
the
girl
at
Castle
Brady
,
name
them
from
Biddy
to
Becky
downward
,
and
sign
myself
,
as
in
truth
I
be
,
her
affectionate
son
,
Redmond
Barry
,
in
Captain
Potzdorffs
company
of
the
Bulowisch
regiment
of
foot
in
garrison
at
Berlin
.
<EOS>
also
I
tell
her
a
pleasant
story
about
the
King
kick
the
Chancellor
and
three
judge
downstairs
,
as
he
have
do
one
day
when
I
be
on
guard
at
Potsdam
,
and
say
I
hope
for
another
war
soon
,
when
I
may
rise
to
be
an
officer
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
you
may
have
imagine
my
letter
to
be
that
of
the
happy
fellow
in
the
world
,
and
I
be
not
on
this
head
at
all
sorry
to
mislead
my
kind
parent
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
sure
my
letter
be
read
,
for
Captain
Potzdorff
begin
ask
me
some
day
afterwards
about
my
family
,
and
I
tell
him
the
circumstance
pretty
truly
,
all
thing
consider
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
cadet
of
a
good
family
,
but
my
mother
be
almost
ruin
and
have
barely
enough
to
support
her
eight
daughter
,
whom
I
name
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
to
study
for
the
law
at
Dublin
,
where
I
have
get
into
debt
and
bad
company
,
have
kill
a
man
in
a
duel
,
and
would
be
hang
or
imprison
by
his
powerful
friend
,
if
I
return
.
<EOS>
I
have
enlist
in
the
english
service
,
where
an
opportunity
for
escape
present
itself
to
me
such
as
I
could
not
resist
;
and
hereupon
I
tell
the
story
of
Mr.
Fakenham
of
Fakenham
in
such
a
way
as
make
my
patron
to
be
convulse
with
laughter
,
and
he
tell
me
afterwards
that
he
have
repeat
the
story
at
Madame
de
Kamake
's
evening
assembly
,
where
all
the
world
be
anxious
to
have
a
sight
of
the
young
Englander
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
the
british
Ambassador
there
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
,
in
a
tone
of
the
great
alarm
,
and
add
,
"
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
sir
,
do
not
tell
my
name
to
him
,
or
he
may
ask
to
have
me
deliver
up
:
and
I
have
no
fancy
to
go
to
be
hang
in
my
dear
native
country
.
"
<EOS>
Potzdorff
,
laughing
,
say
he
would
take
care
that
I
should
remain
where
I
be
,
on
which
I
swear
eternal
gratitude
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
some
day
afterwards
,
and
with
rather
a
grave
face
,
he
say
to
me
,
"
Redmond
,
I
have
be
talk
to
our
colonel
about
you
,
and
as
I
wonder
that
a
fellow
of
your
courage
and
talent
have
not
be
advance
during
the
war
,
the
general
say
they
have
have
their
eye
upon
you
:
that
you
be
a
gallant
soldier
,
and
have
evidently
come
of
a
good
stock
;
that
no
man
in
the
regiment
have
have
less
fault
find
with
him
;
but
that
no
man
merit
promotion
less
.
<EOS>
You
be
idle
,
dissolute
,
and
unprinciple
;
you
have
do
a
deal
of
harm
to
the
man
;
and
,
for
all
your
talent
and
bravery
,
he
be
sure
would
come
to
no
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
!
"
say
I
,
quite
astonish
that
any
mortal
man
should
have
form
such
an
opinion
of
me
,
"
I
hope
General
Bulow
be
mistaken
regard
my
character
.
<EOS>
I
have
fall
into
bad
company
,
it
be
true
;
but
I
have
only
do
as
other
soldier
have
do
;
and
,
above
all
,
I
have
never
have
a
kind
friend
and
protector
before
,
to
whom
I
may
show
that
I
be
worthy
of
well
thing
.
<EOS>
the
general
may
say
I
be
a
ruin
lad
,
and
send
me
to
the
d###l
:
but
be
sure
of
this
,
I
would
go
to
the
d###l
to
serve
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
speech
I
see
pleased
my
patron
very
much
;
and
,
as
I
be
very
discreet
and
useful
in
a
thousand
delicate
way
to
him
,
he
soon
come
to
have
a
sincere
attachment
for
me
.
<EOS>
one
day
,
or
rather
night
,
when
he
be
tete
-
a
-
tete
with
the
lady
of
the
Tabaks
Rath
von
Dose
for
instance
,
I
 
<EOS>
but
there
be
no
use
in
tell
affair
which
concern
nobody
now
.
  
<EOS>
four
month
after
my
letter
to
my
mother
,
I
get
,
under
cover
to
the
Captain
,
a
reply
,
which
create
in
my
mind
a
yearning
after
home
,
and
a
melancholy
which
I
can
not
describe
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
see
the
dear
soul
's
writing
for
five
year
.
<EOS>
all
the
old
day
,
and
the
fresh
happy
sunshine
of
the
old
green
field
in
Ireland
,
and
her
love
,
and
my
uncle
,
and
Phil
Purcell
,
and
everything
that
I
have
do
and
think
,
come
back
to
me
as
I
read
the
letter
;
and
when
I
be
alone
<EOS>
I
cry
over
it
,
as
I
have
not
do
since
the
day
when
Nora
jilt
me
.
<EOS>
I
take
care
not
to
show
my
feeling
to
the
regiment
or
my
captain
:
but
that
night
,
when
I
be
to
have
take
tea
at
the
Garden
-
house
outside
Brandenburg
Gate
,
with
Fraulein
Lottchen
(
the
Tabaks
Rathinn
's
gentlewoman
of
company
)
,
I
somehow
have
not
the
courage
to
go
;
but
beg
to
be
excuse
,
and
go
early
to
bed
in
barrack
,
out
of
which
I
go
and
come
now
almost
as
I
will
,
and
pass
a
long
night
weeping
and
think
about
dear
Ireland
.
  
<EOS>
next
day
,
my
spirit
rise
again
and
I
get
a
ten
-
guinea
bill
cash
,
which
my
mother
send
in
the
letter
,
and
give
a
handsome
treat
to
some
of
my
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
the
poor
soul
's
letter
be
blot
all
over
with
tear
,
full
of
text
,
and
write
in
the
wildest
incoherent
way
.
<EOS>
She
say
she
be
delighted
to
think
I
be
under
a
protestant
prince
,
though
she
fear
he
be
not
in
the
right
way
:
<EOS>
that
right
way
,
she
say
,
she
have
the
blessing
to
find
,
under
the
guidance
of
the
Reverend
Joshua
Jowls
,
whom
she
sit
under
.
<EOS>
She
say
he
be
a
precious
choose
vessel
;
a
sweet
ointment
and
precious
box
of
spikenard
;
and
make
use
of
a
great
number
<EOS>
more
phrase
that
I
could
not
understand
;
but
one
thing
be
clear
in
the
midst
of
all
this
jargon
,
that
the
good
soul
love
her
son
still
,
and
think
and
pray
day
and
night
for
her
wild
Redmond
.
<EOS>
have
it
not
come
across
many
a
poor
fellow
,
in
a
solitary
night
's
watch
,
or
in
sorrow
,
sickness
,
or
captivity
,
that
at
that
very
minute
,
most
likely
,
his
mother
be
pray
for
him
?
<EOS>
I
often
have
have
these
thought
;
but
they
be
none
of
the
gay
,
and
it
be
quite
as
well
that
they
do
not
come
to
you
in
company
;
for
where
would
be
a
set
of
jolly
fellow
then
?
 
<EOS>
as
mute
as
undertaker
at
a
funeral
,
I
promise
you
.
<EOS>
I
drink
my
mother
's
health
that
night
in
a
bumper
,
and
live
like
a
gentleman
whilst
the
money
last
.
<EOS>
She
pinch
herself
to
give
it
me
,
as
she
tell
me
afterwards
;
and
Mr.
Jowls
be
very
wroth
with
her
.
<EOS>
although
the
good
soul
's
money
be
very
quickly
spend
,
I
be
not
long
in
get
more
;
for
I
have
a
hundred
way
of
get
it
,
and
become
a
universal
favourite
with
the
Captain
and
his
friend
.
<EOS>
now
,
it
be
Madame
von
Dose
who
give
me
a
Frederic
-
d'or
for
bring
her
a
bouquet
or
a
letter
from
the
Captain
;
now
it
be
,
on
the
contrary
,
the
old
Privy
Councillor
who
treat
me
with
a
bottle
of
Rhenish
,
and
slip
into
my
hand
a
dollar
or
two
,
in
order
that
I
may
give
him
some
information
regard
the
liaison
between
my
captain
and
his
lady
.
<EOS>
but
though
I
be
not
such
a
fool
as
not
to
take
his
money
,
you
may
be
sure
I
be
not
dishonourable
enough
to
betray
my
benefactor
;
and
he
get
very
little
out
of
me
.
<EOS>
when
the
Captain
and
the
lady
fall
out
,
and
he
begin
to
pay
his
address
to
the
rich
daughter
of
the
Dutch
Minister
,
I
do
not
know
how
many
more
letter
and
guinea
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
Tabaks
Rathinn
hand
over
to
me
,
that
I
may
get
her
lover
back
again
.
<EOS>
but
such
return
be
rare
in
love
,
and
the
Captain
use
only
to
laugh
at
her
stale
sigh
and
entreaty
.
<EOS>
in
the
house
of
Mynheer
Van
Guldensack
I
make
myself
so
pleasant
to
high
and
low
,
that
I
come
to
be
quite
intimate
there
:
and
get
the
knowledge
of
a
state
secret
or
two
,
which
surprise
and
please
my
captain
very
much
.
<EOS>
these
little
hint
he
carry
to
his
uncle
,
the
Minister
of
Police
,
who
,
no
doubt
,
make
his
advantage
of
them
;
and
thus
I
begin
to
be
receive
quite
in
a
confidential
light
by
the
Potzdorff
family
,
and
become
a
mere
nominal
soldier
,
be
allow
to
appear
in
plain
clothe
(
which
be
,
I
warrant
you
,
of
a
neat
fashion
)
,
and
to
enjoy
myself
in
a
hundred
way
,
which
the
poor
fellow
my
comrade
envy
.
<EOS>
as
for
the
sergeant
,
they
be
as
civil
to
me
as
to
an
officer
:
it
be
as
much
as
their
stripe
be
worth
to
offend
a
person
who
have
the
ear
of
the
Minister
's
nephew
.
<EOS>
there
be
in
my
company
a
young
fellow
by
the
name
of
Kurz
,
who
be
six
foot
high
in
spite
of
his
name
,
and
whose
life
I
have
save
in
some
affair
of
the
war
.
<EOS>
what
do
this
lad
do
,
after
I
have
recount
to
him
one
of
my
adventure
,
but
call
me
a
spy
and
informer
,
and
beg
me
not
to
call
him
DU
any
more
,
as
be
the
fashion
with
young
man
when
they
be
very
intimate
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
for
it
but
to
call
him
out
;
but
I
owe
him
no
grudge
.
<EOS>
I
disarm
him
in
a
twinkling
;
and
as
I
send
his
sword
fly
over
his
head
,
say
to
him
,
"
kurz
,
do
ever
you
know
a
man
guilty
of
a
mean
action
who
can
do
as
I
do
now
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
silence
the
rest
of
the
grumbler
;
and
no
man
ever
sneer
at
me
after
that
.
  
<EOS>
no
man
can
suppose
that
to
a
person
of
my
fashion
the
waiting
in
antechamber
,
the
conversation
of
footman
and
hanger
-
on
,
be
pleasant
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
not
more
degrading
than
the
barrack
-
room
,
of
which
I
need
not
say
I
be
heartily
sick
.
<EOS>
My
protestation
of
like
for
the
army
be
all
intend
to
throw
dust
into
the
eye
of
my
employer
.
<EOS>
I
sigh
to
be
out
of
slavery
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
be
bear
to
make
a
figure
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
have
I
be
one
of
the
Neiss
garrison
,
I
would
have
cut
my
way
to
freedom
by
the
side
of
the
gallant
Frenchman
;
but
here
I
have
only
artifice
to
enable
me
to
attain
my
end
,
and
be
not
I
justify
in
employ
it
?
<EOS>
My
plan
be
this
:
I
may
make
myself
so
necessary
to
M.
de
Potzdorff
,
that
he
will
obtain
my
freedom
.
<EOS>
once
free
,
with
my
fine
person
and
good
family
,
I
will
do
what
ten
thousand
irish
gentleman
have
do
before
,
and
will
marry
a
lady
of
fortune
and
condition
.
<EOS>
and
the
proof
that
I
be
,
if
not
disintereste
,
at
least
actuate
by
a
noble
ambition
,
be
this
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
fat
grocer
's
widow
in
Berlin
with
six
hundred
thaler
of
rent
,
and
a
good
business
,
who
give
me
to
understand
that
she
would
purchase
my
discharge
if
I
would
marry
her
;
but
I
frankly
tell
her
that
I
be
not
make
to
be
a
grocer
,
and
thus
absolutely
fling
away
a
chance
of
freedom
which
she
offer
me
.
  
<EOS>
and
I
be
grateful
to
my
employer
;
more
grateful
than
they
to
me
.
<EOS>
the
Captain
be
in
debt
,
and
have
dealing
with
the
Jews
,
to
whom
he
give
note
of
hand
payable
on
his
uncle
's
death
.
<EOS>
the
old
Herr
von
Potzdorff
,
see
the
confidence
his
nephew
have
in
me
,
offer
to
bribe
me
to
know
what
the
young
man
's
affair
really
be
.
<EOS>
but
what
do
I
do
?
<EOS>
I
inform
Monsieur
George
von
Potzdorff
of
the
fact
;
and
we
make
out
,
in
concert
,
a
list
of
little
debt
,
so
moderate
,
that
they
actually
appease
the
old
uncle
instead
of
irritate
,
and
he
pay
them
,
be
glad
to
get
off
so
cheap
.
  
<EOS>
and
a
pretty
return
I
get
for
this
fidelity
.
<EOS>
one
morning
,
the
old
gentleman
be
closet
with
his
nephew
(
he
use
to
come
to
get
any
news
stir
as
to
what
the
young
officer
of
the
regiment
be
do
:
whether
this
or
that
gamble
;
who
intrigue
,
and
with
whom
;
who
be
at
the
ridotto
on
such
a
night
;
who
be
in
debt
,
and
what
not
;
for
the
King
like
to
know
the
business
of
every
officer
in
his
army
)
,
I
be
send
with
a
letter
to
the
Marquis
d'Argens
(
that
afterwards
marry
Mademoiselle
Cochois
the
actress
)
,
and
,
meet
the
Marquis
at
a
few
pace
off
in
the
street
,
give
my
message
,
and
return
to
the
Captain
's
lodging
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
worthy
uncle
be
make
my
unworthy
self
the
subject
of
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
noble
,
"
say
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
"
reply
the
uncle
(
whom
I
could
have
throttle
for
his
insolence
)
.
<EOS>
"
all
the
beggarly
Irish
who
ever
enlist
tell
the
same
story

He

M.

;

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
I
promise
the
lad
I
would
ask
for
his
discharge
;
and
I
be
sure
you
can
make
him
useful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
ask
his
discharge
,
"
answer
the
elder
,
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
Bon
Dieu
!
<EOS>
You
be
a
model
of
probity
!
<EOS>
You
will
never
succeed
to
my
place
,
George
,
if
you
be
no
wise
than
you
be
just
now
.
<EOS>
make
the
fellow
as
useful
to
you
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
good
manner
and
a
frank
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
can
lie
with
an
assurance
that
I
never
see
surpassed
,
and
fight
,
you
say
,
on
a
pinch
.
<EOS>
the
scoundrel
do
not
want
for
good
quality
;
but
he
be
vain
,
a
spendthrift
,
and
a
bavard
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
you
have
the
regiment
in
terrorem
over
him
,
you
can
do
as
you
like
with
him
.
<EOS>
once
let
him
loose
,
and
the
lad
be
likely
to
give
you
the
slip
.
<EOS>
keep
on
promise
him
;
promise
to
make
him
a
general
,
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
what
the
deuce
do
I
care
?
<EOS>
there
be
spy
enough
to
be
have
in
this
town
without
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
thus
that
the
service
I
render
to
M.
Potzdorff
be
qualify
by
that
ungrateful
old
gentleman
;
and
I
steal
away
from
the
room
extremely
trouble
in
spirit
,
to
think
that
another
of
my
fond
dream
be
thus
dispel
;
and
that
my
hope
of
get
out
of
the
army
,
by
be
useful
to
the
Captain
,
be
entirely
vain
.
<EOS>
for
some
time
my
despair
be
such
,
that
I
think
of
marry
the
widow
;
but
the
marriage
of
private
be
never
allow
without
the
direct
permission
of
the
King
;
and
it
be
a
matter
of
very
great
doubt
whether
His
Majesty
would
allow
a
young
fellow
of
twenty
-
two
,
the
handsome
man
of
his
army
,
to
be
couple
to
a
pimpleface
old
widow
of
sixty
,
who
be
quite
beyond
the
age
when
her
marriage
would
be
likely
to
multiply
the
subject
of
His
Majesty
.
<EOS>
this
hope
of
liberty
be
therefore
vain
;
nor
could
I
hope
to
purchase
my
discharge
,
unless
any
charitable
soul
would
lend
me
a
large
sum
of
money
;
for
,
though
I
make
a
good
deal
,
as
I
have
say
,
yet
I
have
always
have
through
life
an
incorrigible
knack
of
spending
,
and
<EOS>
(
such
be
my
generosity
of
disposition
)
have
be
in
debt
ever
since
I
be
bear
.
  
<EOS>
My
captain
,
the
sly
rascal
!
<EOS>
give
me
a
very
different
version
of
his
conversation
with
his
uncle
to
that
which
I
know
to
be
the
true
one
;
and
say
smilingly
to
me
,
"
Redmond

I
have
speak
to
the
Minister

thy
services,[footnote

<EOS>
the
service
about
which
Mr.
Barry
here
speak
have
,
and
we
suspect
purposely
,
be
describe
by
him
in
very
dubious
term
.
<EOS>
It
be
most
probable
that
he
be
employ
to
wait
at
the
table
of
stranger
in
Berlin
,

to
bring
to
the
Police
Minister
any

the
great

hospitable
precaution

as
for
the
duel
which
Mr.
Barry
fight

may
we
be
allow
to
hint
a
doubt

to
a
great
number
of
these

It
will
be

in
one

awkward

do
what
the

do
not
usually
consider
respectable

in
which

which

argue
that
he

a
man
of
undoubted
honour

We
shall
get
thee
out

although
I
do
not
believe
a
word
of
this
speech
,
I
affect
to
be
very
much
move
by
it

eternal
gratitude

You
must

of
course
you
will
not
know

if
the
Chevalier
ask
as
to
the
particularity

do
you

"

<EOS>
only

as

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

I
have
think
you
more
expert
.
<EOS>
You
must
find
out
if
the
Chevalier
cheat
;
if
he
do
,
we
have
him
.
<EOS>
He
see
the
english
and
austrian
envoy
continually
,
and
the
young
man
of
either
Ministry
sup
repeatedly
at
his
house
.
<EOS>
find
out
what
they
talk
of
;
for
how
much
each
play
,
especially
if
any
of
them
play
on
parole
:
if
you
can
read
his
private
letter
,
of
course
you
will
;
though
about
those
which
go
to
the
post
,
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
;
we
look
at
them
there
.
<EOS>
but
never
see
him
write
a
note
without
find
out
to
whom
it
go
,
and
by
what
channel
or
messenger
.
<EOS>
He
sleep
with
the
key
of
his
despatch
-
box
on
a
string
round
his
neck
.
<EOS>
twenty
Frederics
,
if
you
get
an
impression
of
the
key
.
<EOS>
You
will
,
of
course
,
go
in
plain
clothe
.
<EOS>
You
have
best
brush
the
powder
out
of
your
hair
,
and
tie
it
with
a
riband
simply
;
your
moustache
you
must
of
course
shave
off
.
  
<EOS>
with
these
instruction
,
and
a
very
small
gratuity
,
the
Captain
leave
me
.
<EOS>
when
I
again
see
him
,
he
be
amuse
at
the
change
in
my
appearance
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
not
without
a
pang
(
for
they
be
as
black
as
jet
,
and
curl
elegantly
)
,
shave
off
my
moustache
;
have
remove
the
odious
grease
and
flour
,
which
I
always
abominate
,
out
of
my
hair
;
have
mount
a
demure
french
grey
coat
,
black
satin
breech
,
and
a
maroon
plush
waistcoat
,
and
a
hat
without
a
cockade
.
<EOS>
I
look
as
meek
and
humble
as
any
servant
out
of
place
could
possibly
appear
;
and
I
think
not
my
own
regiment
,
which
be
now
at
the
review
at
Potsdam
,
would
have
know
me
.
<EOS>
thus
accoutre
,
I
go
to
the
"
Star
Hotel
,
"
where
this
stranger
be
,
 
my
heart
beat
with
anxiety
,
and
something
tell
me
that
this
Chevalier
de
Balibari
be
no
other
than
Barry
,
of
Ballybarry
,
my
father
's
eld
brother
,
who
have
give
up
his
estate
in
consequence
of
his
obstinate
adherence
to
the
romish
superstition
.
<EOS>
before
I
go
in
to
present
myself
,
I
go
to
look
in
the
remise
at
his
carriage
.
<EOS>
have
he
<EOS>
the
Barry
arm
?
<EOS>
yes
,
there
they
be
:
argent
,
a
bend
gule
,
with
four
escallop
of
the
field
,
 
the
ancient
coat
of
my
house
.
<EOS>
They
be
paint
in
a
shield
about
as
big
as
my
hat
,
on
a
smart
chariot
handsomely
gild
,
surmount
with
a
coronet
,
and
support
by
eight
or
nine
Cupids
,
cornucopia
,
and
flower
-
basket
,
accord
to
the
queer
heraldic
fashion
of
those
day
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
he
!
<EOS>
I
feel
quite
feint
as
I
go
up
the
stair
.
<EOS>
I
be
go
to
present
myself
before
my
uncle
in
the
character
of
a
servant
!
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
the
young
man
whom
M.
de
Seebach
recommend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
bow
,
and
hand
him
a
letter
from
that
gentleman
,
with
which
my
captain
have
take
care
to
provide
me
.
<EOS>
as
he
look
at
it
I
have
leisure
to
examine
him
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
be
a
man
of
sixty
year
of
age
,
dress
superbly
in
a
coat
and
breech
of
apricot
-
colour
velvet
,
a
white
satin
waistcoat
embroider
with
gold
like
the
coat
.
<EOS>
across
his
breast
go
the
purple
riband
of
his
order
of
the
Spur
;
and
the
star
of
the
order
,
an
enormous
one
,
sparkle
on
his
breast
.
<EOS>
He
have
ring
on
all
his
finger
,
a
couple
of
watch
in
his
fobs
,
<EOS>
a
rich
diamond
solitaire
in
the
black
riband
round
his
neck
,
and
fasten
to
the
bag
of
his
wig
;
his
ruffle
and
frill
be
decorate
with
a
profusion
of
the
rich
lace
.
<EOS>
He
have
pink
silk
stocking
roll
over
the
knee
,
and
tie
with
gold
garter
;
and
enormous
diamond
buckle
to
his
red
-
heeled
shoe
.
<EOS>
a
sword
mount
in
gold
,
in
a
white
fish
-
skin
scabbard
;
and
a
hat
richly
lace
,
and
line
with
white
feather
,
which
be
lie
on
a
table
beside
him
,
complete
the
costume
of
this
splendid
gentleman
.
<EOS>
in
height
he
be
about
my
size
,
that
is
,
six
foot
and
half
an
inch
;
his
cast
of
feature
singularly
like
mine
,
and
extremely
distingue
.
<EOS>
one
of
his
eye
be
close
with
a
black
patch
,
however
;
he
wear
a
little
white
and
red
paint
,
by
no
mean
an
unusual
ornament
in
those
day
;
and
a
pair
of
moustache
,
which
fall
over
his
lip
and
hide
a
mouth
that
I
afterwards
find
have
rather
a
disagreeable
expression
.
<EOS>
when
his
beard
be
remove
,
the
upper
tooth
appear
to
project
very
much
;
and
his
countenance
wear
a
ghastly
fix
smile
,
by
no
means
pleasant
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
very
imprudent
of
me
;
but
when
I
see
the
splendour
of
his
appearance
,
the
nobleness
of
his
manner
,
I
feel
it
impossible
to
keep
disguise
with
him
;
and
when
he
say
,
"
ah
,
you
be
a
Hungarian
,
I
see
!
<EOS>
"
I
could
hold
no
longer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
be
an
Irishman
,
and
my
name
be
Redmond
Barry
,
of
Ballybarry
.
<EOS>
"
as
I
speak
,
I
burst
into
tear
;
I
can
not
tell
why
;
but
I
have
see
none
of
my
kith
or
kin
for
six
year
,
and
my
heart
long
for
some
one

BARRY

<EOS>
ADIEU
to
military
profession
 
<EOS>
You
who
have
never
be
out
of
your
country
,
know
little
what
it
be
to
hear
a
friendly
voice
in
captivity
;
and
there
be
many
a
man
that
will
not
understand
the
cause
of
the
burst
of
feeling
which
I
have
confess
take
place
on
my
see
my
uncle
.
<EOS>
He
never
for
a
minute
thought
to
question
the
truth
of
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
Mother
of
God
!
"
<EOS>
cry
he
,
"
it
be
my
brother
Harry
's
son
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
think
in
my
heart
he
be
as
much
affect
as
I
be
at
thus
suddenly
find
one
of
his
kindre
;
for
he
,
too
,
be
an
exile
from
home
,
and
a
friendly
voice
,
a
look
,
bring
the
old
country
back
to
his
memory
again
,
and
the
old
day
of
his
boyhood
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
give
five
year
of
my
life
to
see
them
again
,
"
say
he
,
after
caress
me
very
warmly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
"
ask
I.
"
<EOS>
why
,
"
reply
he
,
"
the
green
field
,
and
the
river
,
and
the
old
round
tower
,
and
the
burying
-
place
at
Ballybarry
.
'
<EOS>
Twas
a
shame
for
your
father
to
part
with
the
land
,
Redmond
,
that
go
so
long
with
the
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
then
begin
to
ask
me
concern
myself
,
and
I
give
him
my
history
at
some
length
;
at
which
the
worthy
gentleman
laugh
many
time
,
say
,
that
I
be
a
Barry
all
over
.
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
my
story
he
would
stop
me
,
to
make
me
stand
back
to
back
,
and
measure
with
him
(
by
which
I
ascertain
that
our
height
be
the
same
,
and
that
my
uncle
have
a
stiff
knee
,
moreover
,
which
make
him
walk
in
a
peculiar
way
)
,
and
utter
,
during
the
course
of
the
narrative
,
a
hundred
exclamation
of
pity
,
and
kindness
,
and
sympathy
.
<EOS>
It
be
"
Holy
Saints
!
"
<EOS>
and
"
Mother
of
Heaven
!
"
<EOS>
and
"
Blessed
Mary
!
"
<EOS>
continually
;
by
which
,
and
with
justice
,
I
conclude
that
he
be
still
devotedly
attach
to
the
ancient
faith
of
our
family
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
with
some
difficulty
that
I
come
to
explain
to
him
the
last
part
of
my
history
,
viz
.
,
that
I
be
put
into
his
service
as
a
watch
upon
his
action
,
of
which
I
be
to
give
information
in
a
certain
quarter
.
<EOS>
when
I
tell
him
(
with
a
great
deal
of
hesitation
)
of
this
fact
,
he
burst
out
laugh
,
and
enjoy
the
joke
amazingly
.
"
<EOS>
the
rascal
!
"
say
he
;
"
they
think
to
catch
me
,
do
they
?
<EOS>
why
,
Redmond
,
my
chief
conspiracy
be
a
faro
-
bank
.
<EOS>
but
the
King
be
so
jealous
,
that
he
will
see
a
spy
in
every
person
who
come
to
his
miserable
capital
in
the
great
sandy
desert
here
.
<EOS>
ah
,
my
boy
,
I
must
show
you
Paris
and
Vienna
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
say
there
be
nothing
I
long
for
more
than
to
see
any
city
but
Berlin
,
and
should
be
delighted
to
be
free
of
the
odious
military
service
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
think
,
from
his
splendour
of
appearance
,
the
knickknack
about
the
room
,
the
gilded
carriage
in
the
remise
,
that
my
uncle
be
a
man
of
vast
property
;
and
that
he
would
purchase
a
dozen
,
nay
,
a
whole
regiment
of
substitute
,
in
order
to
restore
me
to
freedom
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
be
mistaken
in
my
calculation
regard
him
,
as
his
history
of
himself
speedily
show
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
beat
about
the
world

"
say
he
,
"
ever
since
the

1742

when
my

and
Heaven
forgive
him

my

estate
from
under
my

by

heretic

in

that
scold
of
a

of
yours

<EOS>
well
,
let
bygone
be
bygone

'
<EOS>
Tis
probable
that
I
should
have
run
through
the
little
property
as
he
do
in
my
place
,
and
I
should
have
have
to
begin
a
year

two
later

of

I
be
glad
to
have
such
an
opportunity
of
acquire
knowledge
,

profess

delighted

<EOS>
the
Chevalier

account
of
himself
rather
disagreeably
affect
me
.
<EOS>
all
his
show
be
on
his
back
,
as
he
say
.
<EOS>
His
carriage
,
with
the
fine
gilding
,
be
a
part
of
his
stock
in
trade

<EOS>
He
have
a

it

a

quantity
of

the

there
be
a
young

embassy

my

afterwards
Viscount

Earl

keep
my
character
of
valet
;
that
in
the
presence
of
stranger
I
should
not
know
a
word
of
English
;
that
I
should
keep
a
good
look
-
out
on
the
trump
when
I
be
serve
the
champagne
and
punch
about
;
and
,
have
a
remarkably
fine
eyesight
and
a
great
natural
aptitude
,
I
be
speedily
able
to
give
my
dear
uncle
much
assistance
against
his
opponent
at
the
green
table
.
<EOS>
some
prudish
person
may
affect
indignation
at
the
frankness
of
these
confession
,
but
Heaven
pity
them
!
<EOS>
do
you
suppose
that
any
man
who
have
lose
or
win
a
hundred
thousand
pound
at
play
will
not
take
the
advantage
which
his
neighbour
enjoy
?
<EOS>
They
be
all
the
same
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
only
the
clumsy
fool
who
cheat
;
who
resort
to
the
vulgar
expedient
of
cogged
dice
and
cut
card
.
<EOS>
such
a
man
be
sure
to
go
wrong
some
time
or
other
,
and
be
not
fit
to
play
in
the
society
of
gallant
gentleman
;
and
my
advice
to
people
who
see
such
a
vulgar
person
at
his
prank
be
,
of
course
,
to
back
him
while
he
play
,
but
never
 
never
to
have
anything
to
do
with
him
.
<EOS>
play
grandly
,
honourably
.
<EOS>
be
not
,
of
course
,
cast
down
at
lose
;
but
above
all
,
be
not
eager
at
win
,
as
mean
soul
be
.
<EOS>
and
,
indeed
,
with
all
one
's
skill
and
advantage
,
win
be
often
problematical
;
I
have
see
a
sheer
ignoramus
that
know
no
more
of
play
than
of
Hebrew
,
blunder
you
out
of
five
thousand
pound
in
a
few
turn
of
the
card
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
a
gentleman
and
his
confederate
play
against
another
and
his
confederate
.
<EOS>
one
never
be
secure
in
these
case
:
and
when
one
consider
the
time
and
labour
spend
,
the
genius
,
the
anxiety
,
the
outlay
of
money
require
,
the
multiplicity
of
bad
debt
that
one
meet
with
(
for
dishonourable
rascal
be
to
be
find
at
the
play
-
table
,
as
everywhere
else
in
the
world
)
,
I
say
,
for
my
part
,
the
profession
be
a
bad
one
;
and
,
indeed
,
have
scarcely
ever
meet
a
man
who
,
in
the
end
,
profit
by
it
.
<EOS>
I
be
write
now
with
the
experience
of
a
man
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
at
the
time
I
speak
of
I
be
a
lad
,
dazzle
by
the
idea
of
wealth
,
and
respect
,
certainly
too
much
,
my
uncle
's
superior
age
and
station
in
life
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
need
to
particularise
here
the
little
arrangement
make
between
us
;
the
playman
of
the
present
day
want
no
instruction
,
I
take
it
,
and
the
public
have
little
interest
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
but
simplicity
be
our
secret
.
<EOS>
everything
successful
be
simple
.
<EOS>
if
,
for
instance
,
I
wipe
the
dust
off
a
chair
with
my
napkin
,
it
be
to
show
that
the
enemy
be
strong
in
diamond
;
if
I
push
it
,
he
have
ace
,
king
;
if
I
say
,
"
punch
or
wine
,
my
Lord
?
"
<EOS>
heart
be
mean
;
if
"
wine
or
punch
?
"
club
.
<EOS>
if
I
blow
my
nose
,
it
be
to
indicate
that
there
be
another
confederate
employ
by
the
adversary
;
and
then
,
I
warrant
you
,
some
pretty
trial
of
skill
would
take
place
.
<EOS>
My
Lord
Deuceace
,
although
so
young
,
have
a
very
great
skill
and
cleverness
with
the
card
in
every
way
;
and
it
be
only
from
hear
Frank
Punter
,
who
come
with
him
,
yawn
three
time
when
the
Chevalier
have
the
ace
of
trump
,
that
I
know
we
be
Greek
to
Greek
,
as
it
be
.
  
<EOS>
My
assume
dulness
be
perfect
;
and
I
use
to
make
Monsieur
de
Potzdorff
laugh
with
it
,
when
I
carry
my
little
report
to
him
at
the
Garden
-
house
outside
the
town
where
he
give
me
rendezvous
.
<EOS>
these
report
,
of
course
,
be
arrange
between
me
and
my
uncle
beforehand
.
<EOS>
I
be
instruct
(
and
it
be
always
far
the
good
way
)
to
tell
as
much
truth
as
my
story
would
possibly
bear
.
<EOS>
when
,
for
instance
,
he
would
ask
me
,
"
what
do
the
Chevalier
do
of
a
morning
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
go
to
church
regularly
"
(
he
be
very
religious
)
,
"
and
after
hear
mass
come
home
to
breakfast
.
<EOS>
then
he
take
an
airing
in
his
chariot
till
dinner
,
which
be
serve
at
noon
.
<EOS>
after
dinner
he
write
his
letter
,
if
he
have
any
letter
to
write
:
but
he
have
very
little
to
do
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
His
letter
be
to
the
austrian
envoy
,
with
whom
he
correspond
,
but
who
do
not
acknowledge
him
;
and
be
write
in
English
,
of
course
I
look
over
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
He
generally
write
for
money
.
<EOS>
He
say
he
want
it
to
bribe
the
secretary
of
the
Treasury
,
in
order
to
find
out
really
where
the
alloyed
ducat
come
from
;
but
,
in
fact
,
he
want
it
to
play
of
evening
,
when
he
make
his
party
with
Calsabigi
,
the
lottery
-
contractor
,
the
russian
attache
,
two
from
the
english
embassy
,
my
Lords
Deuceace
and
Punter
,
who
play
a
jeu
d'enfer
,
and
a
few
more
.
<EOS>
the
same
set
meet
every
night
at
supper
:
there
be
seldom
any
lady
;
those
who
come
be
chiefly
french
lady
,
member
of
the
corps
de
ballet
.
<EOS>
He
win
often
,
but
not
always
.
<EOS>
Lord
Deuceace
be
a
very
fine
player
.
<EOS>
the
Chevalier
Elliot
,
the
English
Minister
,
sometimes
come
,
on
which
occasion
the
secretary
do
not
play
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
de
balibari
dine
at
the
mission
,
but
en
petit
comite
,
not
on
grand
day
of
reception
.
<EOS>
Calsabigi
,
I
think
,
be
his
confederate
at
play
.
<EOS>
He
have
win
lately
;
but
the
week
before
last
he
pledge
his
solitaire
for
four
hundred
ducat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
he
and
the
english
attache
talk
together
in
their
own
language
?
"
  
"
yes
;
he
and
the
envoy
speak
yesterday
for
half
-
an
-
hour
about
the
new
danseuse
and
the
american
trouble
:
chiefly
about
the
new
danseuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
will
be
see
that
the
information
I
give
be
very
minute
and
accurate
,
though
not
very
important
.
<EOS>
but
such
as
it
be
,
it
be
carry
to
the
ear
of
that
famous
hero
and
warrior
the
Philosopher
of
Sans
Souci
;
and
there
be
not
a
stranger
who
enter
the
capital
<EOS>
but
his
action
be
similarly
spy
and
relate
to
Frederick
the
great
.
  
<EOS>
as
long
as
the
play
be
confine
to
the
young
man
of
the
different
embassy
,
His
Majesty
do
not
care
to
prevent
it
;
nay
,
he
encourage
play
at
all
the
mission
,
know
full
well
that
a
man
in
difficulty
can
be
make
to
speak
,
and
that
a
timely
rouleau
of
Frederics
would
often
get
him
a
secret
worth
many
thousand
.
<EOS>
He
get
some
paper
from
the
french
house
in
this
way
:
and
I
have
no
doubt
that
my
Lord
Deuceace
would
have
supply
him
with
information
at
a
similar
rate
,
<EOS>
have
his
chief
not
know
the
young
nobleman
's
character
pretty
well
,
and
have
(
as
be
usually
the
case
)
<EOS>
the
work
of
the
mission
perform
by
a
steady
roturier
,
while
the
young
brilliant
blood
of
the
suite
sport
their
embroidery
at
the
ball
,
or
shake
their
Mechlin
ruffle
over
the
green
table
at
faro
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
many
score
of
these
young

since

of
these
and
their
principal
,
and
,
mon
Dieu

<EOS>
what
fool
they
be
!
<EOS>
what
dullard

what

what
addle

head
simple
coxcomb
!
<EOS>
this
be
one
of
the
lie
of
the
world
,
this
diplomacy
;
or
how
could
we
suppose
,
that
be
the
profession
as
difficult
as
the
solemn
red

box
and
tape
-
man
would
have
us
believe
,
they
would
invariably
choose
for
it
little
pink

face
boy
from
school
,
with
no
other
claim
than
mamma

title
,
and
able
at
most
to
judge
of
a
curricle
,
a
new
dance
,
or
a
neat
boot
?
  
<EOS>
when
it
become
know
,
however
,
to
the
officer
of
the
garrison
that
there
be
a
faro
-
table
in
town
,
they
be
wild
to
be
admit
to
the
sport
;
and
,
in
spite
of
my
entreaty
to
the
contrary
,
my
uncle
be
not
averse
to
allow
the
young
gentleman
their
fling
,
and
once
or
twice
clear
a
handsome
sum
out
of
their
purse

<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
<EOS>
I
tell
him
that
I
must
carry
the
news
to
my
captain

before
whom
his
comrade
would
not
fail
to
talk

thus

without

tell

They

"
  
<EOS>

burst
with
laughter

begin
walk
the
room
in

manner
with
his
stiff
knee

<EOS>
the
next
day
,
when
I
go
to
make
my
report
to
Monsieur
de
Potzdorff
,
I
tell
him
of
the
young
prussian
officer
that
have
be
of
late
gambling
;
and
he
reply
,
as
I
expect
,
that
the
King
have
determine
to
send
the
Chevalier
out
of
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
be
a
stingy
curmudgeon

I
reply
;
"
I
have
have

three
frederic
from

month

I
hope
you
will
remember
your

advance
me

<EOS>
"
why
,
three
frederic
be
too
much
for
the
news
you
have
pick
up

say
the
Captain
,
sneer
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
be
not
my
fault
that
there
have
be
no
more

I
reply
.
<EOS>
"
when
be
he
to
go
,
sir
?
"
  
"
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
You
say
he
drive
after
breakfast
and
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
when
he
come
out
to
his
carriage
,
a
couple
of
gendarme
will
mount
the
box
,
and
the
coachman
will
get
his
order
to
move
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
his
baggage
,
sir

"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
oh

that

send

<EOS>
I
have
a
fancy

contain
his

you

at
noon

after
parade

You

not

will
wait
for
me
at
the
Chevalier

room

my
arrival

<EOS>
We
must
force
that
box
.

You

clumsy
hound

you

the
key
long

<EOS>
I
beg
the
Captain
to
remember
me
,
and
so
take
my
leave
of
him
.
<EOS>
the
next
night
I
place
a
couple
of
pistol
under
the
carriage
seat
;
and
I
think
the
adventure
of
the
follow
day
be
quite
worthy
of
the
honour
of
a
separate
chapter
.
   
<EOS>
I

at

the
Chevalier

see
the
chariot

come
down
the
stair
in

"

a
gendarme

who
be

by
the
carriage

and
no
sooner
have
the
Chevalier
enter
,
than
the
officer
jump
in
after
him
,
another
mount
the
box
by
the
coachman

and
the

begin
to
drive

"

the

<EOS>

in

fury

<EOS>
"
as

answer
the
officer
,
and
then
both
relapse
into
silence

<EOS>
the
silence

between
Berlin

Nephew
Redmond

this
come
to
you
by
a
sure

,
no
other
than
Mr.
Lumpit
of
the
English
Mission
,
who
be
acquaint
,
as
all
Berlin
will
be
directly
,
with
our
wonderful
story
.
<EOS>
They
only
know
half
as
yet
;
they
only
know
that
a
deserter
go
off
in
my
clothe
,
and
all
be
in
admiration
of
your
cleverness
and
valour
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
confess
that
for
two
hour
after
your
departure
I
lie
in
bed
in
no
small
trepidation
,
think
whether
His
Majesty
may
have
a
fancy
to
send
me
to
Spandau
,
for
the
freak
of
which
we
have
both
be
guilty
.
<EOS>
but
in
that
case
I
have
take
my
precaution
:
I
have
write
a
statement
of
the
case
to
my
chief
,
the
Austrian
Minister
,
with
the
full
and
true
story
how
you
have
be
set
to
spy
upon
me
,
how
you
turn
out
to
be
my
very
near
relative
,
how
you
have
be
kidnap
yourself
into
the
service
,
and
how
we
both
have
determine
to
effect
your
escape
.
<EOS>
the
laugh
would
have
be
so
much
against
the
King
,
that
he
never
would
have
dare
to
lay
a
finger
upon
me
.
<EOS>
what
would
Monsieur
de
Voltaire
have
say
to
such
an
act
of
tyranny
?
<EOS>
but
it
be
a
lucky
day
,
and
everything
have
turn
out
to
my
wish
.
<EOS>
as
I
lie
in
my
bed
two
and
a
half
hour
after
your
departure
,
in
come
your
ex
-
Captain
Potzdorff

he
,
in

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
no

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
rogue
be
go
out

"
say
he
;
and
straightway
make
for
my
red
box
where
I
keep
my
love
-
letter
,
my
glass
eye
which
I
use
to
wear
,
my
favourite
lucky

with
which
I
throw
the

He
first
try
a
bunch
of
key
,
but
none
of
them
would
fit
the
little
english
lock
.
<EOS>
then
my
gentleman
take
out
of
his
pocket
a
chisel
and
hammer
,
and
fall
to
work
like
a
professional
burglar
,
actually
burst
open
my
little
box

"
now
be
my
time

act

<EOS>
I
advance
towards
him

I
come
noiselessly
up

break

with
all

may
I
deal
him
such

under
pretence

illness

I
have
keep
quiet
until

arrival

,
as
the
Chevalier
de

be
in
particular
good
odour
at
the
Court
of
Dresden

have
be
an
intimate
acquaintance
of
the
late
monarch
,
the
Elector

King
of
Poland

the
most
dissolute
and
agreeable
of
european
prince

<EOS>
,
I
be
speedily
in
the
very
good
society
of
the
Saxon
capital

where
I
may
say
that
my
own
person
and
manner
,
and
the
singularity
of
the
adventure
in
which
I
have
be
a
hero

make
me

welcome

there
be
not

I
have
the
honour
of
kiss
hand

be
graciously
receive
at
Court
by

and
I
write
home
to
my
mother
such
a
flaming
description
of
my
prosperity

that
the
good
soul
very
nearly
forget
her
celestial
welfare

her
confessor
,
the
Reverend
Joshua
Jowls
,
in
order
to
come
after
me
to
Germany
;
but
travel
be
very
difficult
in
those
day
,
and
so
we
be
spare
the
arrival
of
the
good
lady
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
the
soul
of
Harry
Barry
,
my
father
,
who
be
always
so
genteel
in
his
turn
of
mind
,
must
have
rejoice
to
see
the
position
which
I
now
occupy
;
all
the
woman
anxious
to
receive
me
,
all
the
man
in
a
fury
;
hobnob
with
duke
and
count
at
supper
,
dance
minuet
with
high
-
well
-
bear
baroness
(
as
they
absurdly
call
themselves
in
Germany
)
,
with
lovely
excellency
,
nay
,
with
highness
and
transparency
themselves
:
who
could
compete
with
the
gallant
young
irish
noble
?
<EOS>
who
would
suppose
that
seven
week
before
I
have
be
a
common
 
bah
!
<EOS>
I
be
ashamed
to
think
of
it
!
<EOS>
one
of
the
pleasantest
moment
of
my
life
be
at
a
grand
gala
at
the
Electoral
Palace
,
where
I
have
the
honour
of
walk
a
polonaise
with
no
other
than
the
Margravine
of
Bayreuth
,
old
Fritz
's
own
sister
:
<EOS>
old
Fritz
's
,
whose
hateful
blue
-
baize
livery
I
have
wear
,
whose
belt
I
have
pipeclaye
,
and
whose
abominable
ration
of
small
beer
and
sauerkraut
I
have
swallow
for
five
year
.
  
<EOS>
have
win
an
english
chariot
from
an
italian
gentleman
at
play
,
my
uncle
have
our
arm
paint
on
the
panel
in
a
more
splendid
way
than
ever
,
surmount
(
as
we
be
descend
from
the
ancient
king
)
with
an
irish
crown
of
the
most
splendid
size
and
gilding
.
<EOS>
I
have
this
crown
in
lieu
of
a
coronet
engrave
on
a
large
amethyst
signet
-
ring
wear
on
my
forefinger
;
and
I
do
not
mind
confess
that
I
use
to
say
the
jewel
have
be
in
my
family
for
several
thousand
year
,
have
originally
belong
to
my
direct
ancestor
,
his
late
Majesty
King
Brian
Boru
,
or
Barry
.
<EOS>
I
warrant
the
legend
of
the
Heralds
'
College
be
not
more
authentic
than
mine
be
.
  
<EOS>
at
first
the
Minister
and
the
gentleman
at
the
english
hotel
use
to
be
rather
shy
of
us
two
irish
nobleman
,
and
question
our
pretension
to
rank
.
<EOS>
the
Minister
be
a
lord
's
son
,
it
be
true
,
but
he
be
likewise
a
grocer
's
grandson
;
and
so
I
tell
him
at
Count
Lobkowitz
's
masquerade
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
like
a
noble
gentleman
as
he
be
,
know
the
pedigree
of
every
considerable
family
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
He
say
it
be
the
only
knowledge
befit
a
gentleman
;
and
when
we
be
not
at
card
,
we
would
pass
hour
over
Gwillim
or
D'Hozier
,
read
the
genealogy
,
learn
the
blazon
,
and
make
ourselves
acquaint
with
the
relationship
of
our
class
.
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
the
noble
science
be
go
into
disrepute
now
:
so
be
card
,
without
which
study
and
pastime
I
can
hardly
conceive
how
a
man
of
honour
can
exist
.
  
<EOS>
My
first
affair
of
honour
with
a
man
of
undoubted
fashion
be
on
the
score
of
my
nobility
,
with
young
Sir
Rumford
Bumford
of
the
english
embassy
;
my
uncle
at
the
same
time
send
a
cartel
to
the
Minister
,
who
decline
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
shoot
Sir
Rumford
in
the
leg
,
amidst
the
tear
of
joy
of
my
uncle
,
who
accompany
me
to
the
ground
;
and
I
promise
you
that
none
of
the
young
gentleman
question
the
authenticity
of
my
pedigree
,
or
laugh
at
my
irish
crown
again
.
  
<EOS>
what
a
delightful
life
do
we
now
lead
!
<EOS>
I
know
I
be
bear
a
gentleman
,
from
the
kindly
way
in
which
I
take
to
the
business
:
<EOS>
as
business
it
certainly
be
.
<EOS>
for
though
it
seem
all
pleasure
,
yet
I
assure
any
low
-
breed
person
who
may
chance
to
read
this
,
that
we
,
their
better
,
have
to
work
as
well
as
they
:
though
I
do
not
rise
until
noon
,
yet
have
I
not
be
up
at
play
until
long
past
midnight
?
<EOS>
many
a
time
have
we
come
home
to
bed
as
the
troop
be
march
out
to
early
parade
;
and
oh
!
<EOS>
it
do
my
heart
good
to
hear
the
bugle
blow
the
reveille
before
daybreak
,
or
to
see
the
regiment
march
out
to
exercise
,
and
think
that
I
be
no
longer
bind
to
that
disgusting
discipline
,
but
restore
to
my
natural
station
.
  
<EOS>
I
come
into
it
at
once
,
and
as
if
I
have
never
do
anything
else
all
my
life
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
gentleman
to
wait
upon
me
,
a
french
friseur
to
dress
my
hair
of
a
morning
;
I
know
the
taste
of
chocolate
as
by
intuition
almost
,
and
could
distinguish
between
the
right
Spanish
and
the
French
before
I
have
be
a
week
in
my
new
position
;
I
have
ring
on
all
my
finger
,
watch
in
both
my
fobs
,
cane
,
trinket
,
and
snuffbox
of
all
sort
,
and
each
outvye
the
other
in
elegance
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
fine
natural
taste
for
lace
and
china
of
any
man
I
ever
know
;
I
could
judge
a
horse
as
well
as
any
Jew
dealer
in
Germany
;
in
shooting
and
athletic
exercise
I
be
unrivalled
;
I
could
not
spell
,
but
I
could
speak
german
and
French
cleverly
.
<EOS>
I
have
at
the
least
twelve
suit
of
clothe
;
three
richly
embroider
with
gold
,
two

<EOS>
I
have
damask
morning
robe
.
<EOS>
I
take
lesson
on
the
guitar
,
and
sing
french
catch
exquisitely
.
<EOS>
where
,
in
fact
,
be
there
a
more
accomplished
gentleman
than
Redmond
de
Balibari
?
  
<EOS>
all
the
luxury
become
my
station
could
not
,
of
course
,
be
purchase
without
credit
and
money
:
to
procure
which
,
as
our
patrimony
have
be
waste
by
our
ancestor
,
and
we
be
above
the
vulgarity
and
slow
return
and
doubtful
chance
of
trade
,
my
uncle
keep
a
faro
-
bank
.
<EOS>
We
be
in
partnership
with
a
Florentine
,
well
known
in
all
the
Courts
of
Europe
,
the
Count
Alessandro
Pippi
,
as
skilful
a
player
as
ever
be
see
;
but
he
turn
out
a
sad
knave
latterly
,
and
I
have
discover
that
his
countship
be
a
mere
imposture
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
be
maim
,
as
I
have
say
;
Pippi
,
like
all
impostor
,
be
a
coward
;
it
be
my
unrivalled
skill
with
the
sword
,
and
readiness
to
use
it
,
that
maintain
the
reputation
of
the
firm
,
so
to
speak
,
and
silence
many
a
timid
gambler
who
may
have
hesitate
to
pay
his
losing
.
<EOS>
We
always
play
on
parole
with
anybody
:
any
person
,
that
is
,
of
honour
and
noble
lineage
.
<EOS>
We
never
press
for
our
winning
or
decline
to
receive
promissory
note
in
lieu
of
gold
.
<EOS>
but
woe
to
the
man
who
do
not
pay
when
the
note
become
due
!
<EOS>
Redmond
de
Balibari
be
sure
to
wait
upon
him
with
his
bill
,
and
I
promise
you
there
be
very
few
bad
debt
:
on
the
contrary
,
gentleman
be
grateful
to
us
for
our
forbearance
,
and
our
character
for
honour
stand
unimpeached
.
<EOS>
in
later
time
,
a
vulgar
national
prejudice
have
choose
to
cast
a
slur
upon
the
character
of
man
of
honour
engage
in
the
profession
of
play
;
but
I
speak
of
the
good
old
day
in
Europe
,
before
the
cowardice
of
the
french
aristocracy
(
in
the
shameful
Revolution
,
which
serve
them
right
)
bring
discredit
and
ruin
upon
our
order
.
<EOS>
They
cry
fie
now
upon
man
engage
in
play
;
but
I
should
like
to
know
how
much
more
honourable
THEIR
mode
of
livelihood
be
than
our
.
<EOS>
the
broker
of
the
Exchange
who
bull
and
bear
,
and
buy
and
sell
,
and
dabble
with
lie
loan
,
and
trade
on
state
secret
,
what
be
he
but
a
gamester
?
<EOS>
the
merchant
who
deal
in
tea
and
tallow
,
be
he
any
better
?
<EOS>
His
bale
of
dirty
indigo
be
his
dice
,
his
card
come
up
every
year
instead
of
every
ten
minute
,
and
the
sea
be
his
green
table
.
<EOS>
You
call
the
profession
of
the
law
an
honourable
one
,
where
a
man
will
lie
for
any
bidder
;
lie
down
poverty
for
the
sake
of
a
fee
from
wealth
,
lie
down
right
because
wrong
be
in
his
brief
.
<EOS>
You
call
a
doctor
an
honourable
man
,
a
swindling
quack
,
who
do
not
believe
in
the
nostrum
which
he
prescribe
,
and
take
your
guinea
for
whisper
in
your
ear
that
it
be
a
fine
morning
;
and
yet
,
forsooth
,
a
gallant
man
who
sit
him
down
before
the
baize
and
challenge
all
comer
,
his
money
against
theirs
,
his
fortune
against
theirs
,
be
proscribe
by
your
modern
moral
world
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
conspiracy
of
the
middle
class
against
gentleman
:
it
be
only
the
shopkeeper
can
not
which
be
to
go
down
nowadays
.
<EOS>
I
say
that
play
be
an
institution
of
chivalry
:
it
have
be
wreck
,
along
with
other
privilege
of
man
of
birth
.
<EOS>
when
Seingalt
engage
a
man
for
six
-
and
-
thirty
hour
without
leave
the
table
,
do
you
think
he
show
no
courage
?
<EOS>
how
have
we
have
the
good
blood
,
and
the
bright
eye
,
too
,
of
Europe
throb
round
the
table
,
as
I
and
my
uncle
have
hold
the
card
and
the
bank
against
some
terrible
player
,
who
be
match
some
thousand
out
of
his
million
against
our
all
which
be
there
on
the
baize
!
<EOS>
when
we
engage
that
dare
Alexis
Kossloffsky

and
win
seven
thousand
louis
in
a
single
coup
,
have
we
lose
,
we
should
have

next
day

when
he

he
be
only
a

and
a
few
hundred
serf

the
bad

<EOS>
when
,
at
Toeplitz
,
the
Duke
of
Courland
bring
fourteen
lacquey
,
each
with
four
bag
of
florin
,
and
challenge
our
bank
to
play
against
the
seal
bag

what
do
we
ask
?
"
<EOS>
Sir

"
say
we
,
"
we
have
but
eighty
thousand
florin
in
bank
,
or
two
hundred
thousand
at

<EOS>
if
your
Highness
's
bag
do
not
contain
more
than
eighty
thousand
,
we
will
meet
you
.
"
<EOS>
and
we
do
,
and
after
eleven
hour
'
play
,
in
which
our
bank
be
at
one
time
reduce
to
two
hundred
and
three
ducat
,
we
win
seventeen
thousand
florin
of
him
.
<EOS>
be
this
not
something
like
boldness
?
<EOS>
do
this
profession
not
require
skill
,
and
perseverance
,
and
bravery
?
<EOS>
four
crown
head
look
on
at
the
game
,
and
an
imperial
princess
,
when
I
turn
up
the
ace
of
heart
and
make
Paroli
,
burst
into
tear
.
<EOS>
no
man
on
the
European
Continent
hold
a
high
position
than
Redmond
Barry
then
;
and
when
the
Duke
of
Courland
lose
,
he
be
pleased
to
say
that
we
have
win
nobly
;
and
so
we
have
,
and
spend
nobly
what
we
win
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
period
my
uncle
,
who
attend
mass
every
day
regularly
,
always
put
ten
florin
into
the
box
.
<EOS>
wherever
we
go
,
the
tavern
-
keeper
make
us
more
welcome
than
royal
prince
.
<EOS>
We
use
to
give
away
the
break
meat
from
our
supper
and
dinner
to
score
of
beggar
who
bless
us
.
<EOS>
every
man
who
hold
my
horse
or
clean
my
boot
get
a
ducat
for
his
pain
.
<EOS>
I
be
,
I
may
say
,
the
author
of
our
common
good
fortune
,
by
put
boldness
into
our
play
.
<EOS>
Pippi
be
a
faint
-
hearted
fellow
,
who
be
always
cowardly
when
he
begin
to
win
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
(
I
speak
with
great
respect
of
him
)
be
too
much
of
a
devotee
,
and
too
much
of
a
martinet
at
play
ever
to
win
GREATLY
.
<EOS>
His
moral
courage
be
unquestionable
,
but
his
daring
be
not
sufficient
.
<EOS>
both
of
these
my
senior
very
soon
acknowledge
me
to
be
their
chief
,
and
<EOS>
hence
the
style
of
splendour
I
have
describe
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
mention
H.I.H.
the
Princess
Frederica
Amelia
,
who
be
affect
by
my
success
,
and
shall
always
think
with
gratitude
of
the
protection
with
which
that
exalt
lady
honour
me
.
<EOS>
She
be
passionately
fond
of
play
,
as
indeed
be
the
lady
of
almost
all
the
Courts
in
Europe
in
those
day
,
and
hence
would
often
arise
no
small
trouble
to
us
;
for
the
truth
must
be
tell
,
that
lady
love
to
play
,
certainly
,
but
not
to
pay
.
<EOS>
the
point
of
honour
be
not
understand
by
the
charming
sex
;
and
it
be
with
the
great
difficulty
,
in
our
peregrination
to
the
various
Courts
of
Northern
Europe
,
that
we
could
keep
them
from
the
table
,
could
get
their
money
if
they
lose
,
or
,
if
they
pay
,
prevent
them
from
use
the
most
furious
and
extraordinary
mean
of
revenge
.
<EOS>
in
those
great
day
of
our
fortune
,
I
calculate
that
we
lose
no
less
than
fourteen
thousand
louis
by
such
failure
of
payment
.
<EOS>
a
princess
of
a
ducal
house
give
us
paste
instead
of
diamond
,
which
she
have
solemnly
pledge
to
us
;
another
organise
a
robbery
of
the
Crown
jewel
,
and
would
have
charge
the
theft
upon
us
,
but
for
Pippi
's
caution
,
who
have
keep
back
a
note
of
hand
<EOS>
"
her
High
Transparency
"
give
us
,
and
send
it
to
his
ambassador
;
by
which
precaution
I
do
believe
our
neck
be
save
.
<EOS>
a
third
lady
of
high
(
but
not
princely
)
rank
,
after
I
have
win
a
considerable
sum
in
diamond
and
pearl
from
her
,
send
her
lover
with
a
band
of
cut
-
throat
to
waylay
me
;
and
it
be
only
by
extraordinary
courage
,
skill
,
and
good
luck
,
that
I
escape
from
these
villain
,
wound
myself
,
but
leave
the
chief
aggressor
dead
on
the
ground
:
my
sword
enter
his
eye
and
break
there
,
and
the
villain
who
be
with
him
flee
,
see
their
chief
fall
.
<EOS>
They
may
have
finish
me
else
,
for
I
have
no
weapon
of
defence
.
  
<EOS>
thus
it
will
be
see
that
our
life
,
for
all
its
splendour
,
be
one
of
extreme
danger
and
difficulty
,
require
high
talent
and
courage
for
success
;
and
often
,
when
we
be
in
a
full
vein
of
success
,
we
be
suddenly
drive
from
our
ground
on
account
of
some
freak
of
a
reign
prince
,
some
intrigue
of
a
disappointed
mistress
,
or
some
quarrel
with
the
police
minister
.
<EOS>
if
the
latter
personage
be
not
bribe
or
win
over
,
nothing
be
more
common
than
for
us
to
receive
a
sudden
order
of
departure
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
perforce
,
we
live
a
wander
and
desultory
life
.
  
<EOS>
though
the
gain
of
such
a
life
be
,
as
I
have
say
,
very
great
,
yet
the
expense
be
enormous
.
<EOS>
Our
appearance
and
retinue
be
too
splendid
for
the
narrow
mind
of
Pippi
,
who
be
always
cry
out
at
my
extravagance
,
though
oblige
to
own
that
his
own
meanness
and
parsimony
would
never
have
achieve
the
great
victory
which
my
generosity
have
win
.
<EOS>
with
all
our
success
,
our
capital
be
not
very
great
.
<EOS>
that
speech
to
the
Duke
of
Courland
,
for
instance
,
be
a
mere
boast
as
far
as
the
two
hundred
thousand
florin
at
three
month
be
concern
.
<EOS>
We
have
no
credit
,
and
no
money
beyond
that
on
our
table
,
and
should
have
be
force
to
fly
if
his
Highness
have
win
and
accept
our
bill
.
<EOS>
sometimes
,
too
,
we
be
hit
very
hard
.
<EOS>
a
bank
be
a
certainty
,
almost
;
but
now
and
then
a
bad
day
will
come
;
and
man
who
have
the
courage
of
good
fortune
,
at
least
,
ought
to
meet
bad
luck
well
:
the
former
,
believe
me
,
be
the
hard
task
of
the
two
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
these
evil
chance
befell
us
in
the
Duke
of
Baden
's
territory
,
at
Mannheim
.
<EOS>
Pippi
,
who
be
always
on
the
look
-
out
for
business
,
offer
to
make
a
bank
at
the
inn
where
we
put
up
,
and
where
the
officer
of
the
Duke
's
cuirassier
sup
;
and
some
small
play
accordingly
take
place
,
and
some
wretched
crown
and
louis
change
hand
<EOS>
:
I
trust
,
rather
to
the
advantage
of
these
poor
gentleman
of
the
army
,
who
be
surely
the
poor
of
all
devil
under
the
sun
.
  
<EOS>
but
,
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
,
a
couple
of
young
student
from
the
neighbouring
University
of
Heidelberg
,
who
have
come
to
Mannheim
for
their
quarter
's
revenue
,
and
so
have
some
hundred
of
dollar
between
them
,
be
introduce
to
the
table
,
and
,
have
never
play
before
,
begin
to
win
(
as
be
always
the
case
)
.
<EOS>
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
,
too
,
they
be
tipsy
,
and
against
tipsiness
I
have
often
find
the
good
calculation
of
play
fail
entirely
.
<EOS>
They
play
in
the
most
perfectly
insane
way
,
and
yet
win
always
.
<EOS>
every
card
they
back
turn
up
in
their
favour
.
<EOS>
They
have
win
a
hundred
louis
from
us
in
ten
minute
;
and
,
see
that
Pippi
be
grow
angry
and
the
luck
against
us
,
I
be
for
shut
up
the
bank
for
the
night
,
say
the
play
be
only
mean
for
a
joke
,
and
that
now
we
have
have
enough
.
  
<EOS>
but
Pippi
,
who
have
quarrel
with
me
that
day
,
be
determined
to
proceed
,
and
the
upshot
be
,
that
the
student
play
and
win
more
;
then
they
lend
money
to
the
officer
,
who
begin
to
win
,
too
;
and
in
this
ignoble
way
,
in
a
tavern
room
thick
with
tobacco
-
smoke
,
across
a
deal
table
besmear
with
beer
and
liquor
,
and
to
a
parcel
of
hungry
subaltern
and
a
pair
of
beardless
student
,
three
of
the
most
skilful
and
renowned
player
in
Europe
lose
seventeen
hundred
louis
!
<EOS>
I
blush
now
when
I
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
like
Charles
XII
or
Richard
Coeur
de
Lion
fall
before
a
petty
fortress
and
an
unknown
hand
(
as
my
friend
Mr.
Johnson
write
)
,
and
be
,
in
fact
,
a
most
shameful
defeat
.
  
<EOS>
nor
be
this
the
only
defeat
.
<EOS>
when
our
poor
conqueror
have
go
off
,
bewilder
with
the
treasure
which
fortune
have
fling
in
their
way
(
one
of
these
student
be
call
the
Baron
de
Clootz
<EOS>
,
perhaps
he
who
afterwards
lose
his
head
at
Paris
)
,
Pippi
resume
the
quarrel
of
the
morning
,
and
some
exceedingly
high
word
pass
between
us
.
<EOS>
among
other
thing
I
recollect
I
knock
him
down
with
a
stool
,
and
be
for
fling
him
out
of
the
window
;
but
my
uncle
,
who
be
cool
,
and
have
be
keep
Lent
with
his
usual
solemnity
,
interpose
between
us
,
and
a
reconciliation
take
place
,
Pippi
apologise
and
confess
he
have
be
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
doubt
,
however
,
the
sincerity
of
the
treacherous
Italian
;
indeed
,
as
I
never
before
believe
a
word
that
he
say
in
his
life
,
I
know
not
why
I
be
so
foolish
as
to
credit
him
now
,
and
go
to
bed
,
leave
the
key
of
our
cash
-
box
with
him
.
<EOS>
It
contain
,
after
our
loss
to
the
cuirassier
,
in
bill
and
money
,
near
upon
L8000
sterling
.
<EOS>
Pippi
insist
that
our
reconciliation
should
be
ratify
over
a
bowl
of
hot
wine
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
put
some
soporific
drug
into
the
liquor
;
for
my
uncle
and
I
both
sleep
till
very
late
the
next
morning
,
and
wake
with
violent
headache
and
fever
<EOS>
:
we
do
not
quit
our
bed
till
noon
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
go
twelve
hour
,
leave
our
treasury
empty
;
and
behind
him
a
sort
of
calculation
,
by
which
he
strove
to
make
out
that
this
be
his
share
of
the
profit
,
and
that
all
the
loss
have
be
incur
without
his
consent
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
after
eighteen
month
,
we
have
to
begin
the
world
again
.
<EOS>
but
be
I
cast
down
?
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
Our
wardrobe
still
be
worth
a
very
large
sum
of
money
;
for
gentleman
do
not
dress
like
parish
-
clerk
in
those
day
,
and
a
person
of
fashion
would
often
wear
a
suit
of
clothe
and
a
set
of
ornament
that
would
be
a
shop
-
boy
's
fortune
;
so
,
without
repine
for
one
single
minute
,
or
say
a
single
angry
word
(
my
uncle
's
temper
in
this
respect
be
admirable
)
,
or
allow
the
secret
of
our
loss
to
be
know
to
a
mortal
soul
,
we
pawn
three
-
fourth
of
our
jewel
and
clothe
to
Moses
Lowe
the
banker
,
and
with
the
produce
of
the
sale
,
and
our
private
pocket
-
money
,
amount
in
all
to
something
less
than
800
louis
<EOS>

we
take
the
field
again

<EOS>
I
be
not
go
to
entertain
my
reader
with
an
account
of
my
professional
career
as
a
gamester

any
more
than
I
do
with
anecdote
of
my
life
as
a
military
man

<EOS>
I
may
fill
volume
with
tale
of
this
kind
<EOS>
be
I
so
minded
;
but
at
this
rate

my
recital
would
not
be
bring
to
a

for
year

and
who
know
how
soon
I
may
be
call
upon
to

<EOS>
I

I

and
give

intolerable

such

the

illness

<EOS>
ah

<EOS>
I
suffer
from
none
of
these
ill

the

66

when
there
be
no

more
gay

young

<EOS>
before
the
treachery
of
the
scoundrel
Pippi
,
I
have
visit
many
of
the
good
Courts
of
Europe
;
especially
the
small
one
,
where
play
be
patronise
,
and
the
professor
of
that
science
<EOS>
always
welcome
.
<EOS>
among
the
ecclesiastical
principality
of
the
Rhine
we
be
particularly
well
receive
.
<EOS>
I
never
know
finer
or
gayer
Courts
than
those
of
the
Electors
of
Treves
and
Cologne
,
where
there
be
more
splendour
and
gaiety
than
at
Vienna
;
far
more
than
in
the
wretched
barrack
-
court
of
Berlin
.
<EOS>
the
Court
of
the
Archduchess
-
Governess
of
the
Netherlands
be
,
likewise
,
a
royal
place
for
us
knights
of
the
dice
-
box
and
gallant
votary
of
fortune
;
whereas
in
the
stingy
Dutch
or
the
beggarly
swiss
republic
,
it
be
impossible
for
a
gentleman
to
gain
a
livelihood
unmoleste

<EOS>
after
our
mishap
at
Mannheim
,
my

I

<EOS>
the
reader
may
find
out
the
place
easily
enough
;
but
I
do
not
choose
to
print
at
full
the
name
of
some
illustrious
person
in
whose
society
I
then
fall
,
and
among
whom
I
be
make
the
sharer
in
a
very
strange
and
tragical
adventure
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
Court
in
Europe
at
which
stranger
be
more
welcome
than
at
that
of
the
noble
Duke
of
X
#

;
none
where
pleasure
be
more
eagerly
seek
after
,
and
more
splendidly
enjoy
.
<EOS>
the
Prince
do
not
inhabit
his
capital
of
S
#
#
#
,
but
,
imitate
in
every
respect
the
ceremonial
of
the
Court
of
Versailles
,
build
himself
a
magnificent
palace
at
a
few
league
from
his
chief
city
,
and
round
about
his
palace
a
superb
aristocratic
town
,
inhabit
entirely
by
his
noble
,
and
the
officer
of
his
sumptuous
Court
.
<EOS>
the
people
be
rather
hardly
press
,
to
be
sure
,
in
order
to
keep
up
this
splendour
;
for
his
Highness
's
dominion
be
small
,
and
so
he
wisely
live
in
a
sort
of
awful
retirement
from
them
,
seldom
show
his
face
in
his
capital
,
or
see
any
countenance
but
those
of
his
faithful
domestic
and
officer
.
<EOS>
His
palace
and
garden
of
Ludwigslust
be
exactly
on
the
french
model
.
<EOS>
twice
a
week
there
be
Court
reception
,
and
grand
Court
gala
twice
a
month
.
<EOS>
there
be
the
fine
opera
out
of
France
,
and
a
ballet
unrivalle
in
splendour
;
on
which
his
Highness
,
a
great
lover
of
music
and
dancing
,
expend
prodigious
sum
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
because
I
be
then
young
,
but
I
think
I
never
see
such
an
assemblage
of
brilliant
beauty
as
use
to
figure
there
on
the
stage
of
the
Court
theatre
,
in
the
grand
mythological
ballet
which
be
then
the
mode
,
and
in
which
you
see
Mars
in
red
-
heeled
pump
and
a
periwig
,
and
Venus
in
patch
and
a
hoop
.
<EOS>
They
say
the
costume
be
incorrect
,
and
have
change
it
since
;
but
for
my
part
,
I
have
never
see
a
Venus
more
lovely
than
the
Coralie
,
who
be
the
chief
dancer
,
and
find
no
fault
with
the
attendant
nymph
,
in
their
train
,
and
lappet
,
and
powder
.
<EOS>
these
opera
use
to
take
place
twice
a
week
,
after
which
some
great
officer
of
the
Court
would
have
his
evening
,
and
his
brilliant
supper
,
and
the
dice

box
rattle
everywhere
,
and
all
the
world
play
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
seventy
play

table
set
out
in
the
grand
gallery
of
Ludwigslust
,
besides
the
faro

bank
;
where
the
Duke
himself
would
graciously
come
and
play
,
and
win
or
lose
with
a
truly
royal
splendour
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
hither
<EOS>
we
come
after
the
Mannheim
misfortune
.
<EOS>
the
nobility
of
the
Court
be
pleased
to
say
our
reputation
have
precede
us
,
and
the
two
irish
gentleman
be
make
welcome
.
<EOS>
the
very
first
night
at
Court
we
lose
740
of
our
800
louis
;
the
next
evening
,
at
the
Court
Marshal
's
table
,
I
win
them
back
,
with
1300
more
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
we
allow
no
one
to
know
how
near
we
be
to
ruin
on
the
first
evening
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
I
endear
every
one
to
me
by
my
gay
manner
of
losing
,
and
the
Finance
Minister
himself
cash
a
note
for
400
ducat
,
draw
by
me
upon
my
steward
of
Ballybarry
Castle
in
the
kingdom
of
Ireland
;
which
very
note
I
win
from
his
Excellency
the
next
day
,
along
with
a
considerable
sum
in
ready
cash
.
<EOS>
in
that
noble
Court
everybody
be
a
gambler
.
<EOS>
You
would
see
the
lacquey
in
the
ducal
ante
-
room
at
work
with
their
dirty
pack
of
card
;
the
coach
and
chair
man
play
in
the
court
,
while
their
master
be
punt
in
the
saloon
above
;
the
very
cook

maid
and
scullion
,
I
be
tell
,
have
a
bank
,
where
one
of
them
,
an
italian
confectioner
,
make
a
handsome
fortune
:
he
purchase
afterwards
a
roman
marquisate
,
and
his
son
have
figure
as
one
of
the
most
fashionable
of
the
illustrious
foreigner
in
London
.
<EOS>
the
poor
devil
of
soldier
play
away
their
pay
when
they
get
it
,
which
be
seldom
;
and
I
do
not
believe
there
be
an
officer
in
any
one
of
the
guard
regiment
but
have
his
card
in
his
pouch
,
and
no
more
forget
his
dice
than
his
sword
-
knot
.
<EOS>
among
such
fellow
it
be
diamond
cut
diamond
.
<EOS>
what
you
call
fair
play
would
have
be
a
folly
.
<EOS>
the
gentleman
of
Ballybarry
would
have
be
fool
indeed
to
appear
as
pigeon
in
such
a
hawk
's
nest
.
<EOS>
none
but
man
of
courage
and
genius
could
live
and
prosper
in
a
society
where
every
one
be
bold
and
clever
;
and
here
my
uncle
<EOS>
and
I
hold
our
own
:
ay
,
and
more
than
our
own
.
  
<EOS>
His
Highness
the
Duke
be
a
widower
,
or
rather
,
since
the
death
of
the
reign
Duchess
,
have
contract
a
morganatic
marriage
with
a
lady
whom
he
have
ennoble
,
and
who
consider
it
a
compliment
(
such
be
the
morality
of
those
day
)
to
be
call
the
Northern
Dubarry
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
marry
very
young
,
and
his
son
,
the
Hereditary
Prince
,
may
be
say
to
have
be
the
political
sovereign
of
the
state
:
for
the
reign
Duke
be
fonder
of
pleasure
than
of
politic
,
and
love
to
talk
a
great
deal
more
with
his
grand
huntsman
,
or
the
director
of
his
opera
,
than
with
minister
and
ambassador
.
  
<EOS>
the
Hereditary
Prince
,
whom
I
shall
call
Prince
Victor
,
be
of
a
very
different
character
from
his
august
father
.
<EOS>
He
have
make
the
Wars
of
the
Succession
and
Seven
year
with
great
credit
in
the
Empress
's
service
,
be
of
a
stern
character
,
seldom
appear
at
Court
,
except
when
ceremony
call
him
,
but
live
almost
alone
in
his
wing
of
the
palace
,
where
he
devote
himself
to
the
severe
study
,
be
a
great
astronomer
and
chemist
.
<EOS>
He
share
in
the
rage
then
common
throughout
Europe
,
of
hunt
for
the
philosopher
's
stone
;
and
my
uncle
often
regret
that
he
have
no
smattering
of
chemistry
,
like
Balsamo
(
who
call
himself
Cagliostro
)
,
St.
Germain
,
and
other
individual
,
who
have
obtain
very
great
sum
from
Duke
Victor
by
aid
him
in
his
search
after
the
great
secret
.
<EOS>
His
amusement
be
hunt
and
review
the
troop
;
but
for
him
,
and
if
his
good
-
natured
father
have
not
have
his
aid
,
the
army
would
have
be
play
at
card
all
day
,
and
so
it
be
well
that
the
prudent
prince
be
leave
to
govern
.
  
<EOS>
Duke
Victor
be
fifty
year
of
age
,
and
his
princess
,
the
Princess
Olivia
,
be
scarce
three
-
and
-
twenty
.
<EOS>
They
have
be
marry
seven
year
,
and
in
the
first
year
of
their
union
the
Princess
have
bear
him
a
son
and
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
the
stern
moral
and
manner
,
the
dark
and
ungainly
appearance
,
of
the
husband
,
be
little
likely
to
please
the
brilliant
and
fascinating
young
woman
,
who
have
be
educate
in
the
south
(
she
be
connect
with
the
ducal
house
of

,
who
have
pass
two
year
at
Paris
under
the
guardianship
of
Mesdames
the
daughter
of
His
Most
Christian
Majesty
,
and
who
be
the
life
and
soul
of
the
Court
of
X
#

,
the
gay
of
the
gay
,
the
idol
of
her
august
father
-
in
-
law
,
and
,
indeed
,
of
the
whole
Court
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
beautiful
,
but
charming
;
not
witty
,
but
charming
,
too
,
in
her
conversation
as
in
her
person
.
<EOS>
She
be
extravagant
beyond
all
measure
;
so
false
,
that
you
could
not
trust
her
;
but
her
very
weakness
be
more
win
than
the
virtue
of
other
woman
,
her
selfishness
more
delightful
than
other
'
generosity
.
<EOS>
I
never
know
a
woman
whose
fault
make
her
so
attractive
.
<EOS>
She
use
to
ruin
people
,
and
yet
they
all
love
her
.
<EOS>
My
old
uncle
have
see
her
cheating
at
ombre
,
and
let
her
win
400
louis
without
resist
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
Her
caprice
with
the
officer
and
lady
of
her
household
be
ceaseless
:
but
they
adore
her
.
<EOS>
She
be
the
only
one
of
the
reign
family
whom
the
people
worship
.
<EOS>
She
never
go
abroad
but
they
follow
her
carriage
with
shout
of
acclamation
:
and
,
to
be
generous
to
them
,
she
would
borrow
the
last
penny
from
one
of
her
poor
maid
of
honour
,
whom
she
would
never
pay
.
<EOS>
in
the
early
day
her
husband
be
as
much
fascinate
by
her
as
all
the
rest
of
the
world
be
;
but
her
caprice
have
cause
frightful
outbreak
of
temper
on
his
part
,
and
an
estrangement
which
,
though
interrupt
by
almost
mad
return
of
love
,
be
still
general
.
<EOS>
I
speak
of
her
Royal
Highness
with
perfect
candour
and
admiration
,
although
I
may
be
pardon
for
judge
her
more
severely
,
consider
her
opinion
of
myself
.
<EOS>
She
say
the
eld
Monsieur
de
Balibari
be
a
finished
old
gentleman
,
and
the
young
one
have
the
manner
of
a
courier
.
<EOS>
the
world
have
give
a
different
opinion
,
and
I
can
afford
to
chronicle
this
almost
single
sentence
against
me
.
<EOS>
besides
,
she
have
a
reason
for
her
dislike
to
me
,
which
you
shall
hear
.
  
<EOS>
five
year
in
the
army
,
long
experience
of
the
world
,
have
ere
now
dispel
any
of
those
romantic
notion
regard
love
with
which
I
commence
life
;
and
I
have
determine
,
as
be
proper
with
gentleman
(
it
be
only
your
low
people
who
marry
for
mere
affection
)
,
to
consolidate
my
fortune
by
marriage
.
<EOS>
in
the
course
of
our
peregrination
,
my
uncle
and
I
have
make
several
attempt
to
carry
this
object
into
effect
;
but
numerous
disappointment
have
occur
which
be
not
worth
mention
here
,
and
have
prevent
me
hitherto
from
make
such
a
match
as
I
think
be
worthy
of
a
man
of
my
birth
,
ability
,
and
personal
appearance
.
<EOS>
lady
be
not
in
the
habit
of
run
away
on
the
Continent
,
as
be
the
custom
in
England
(
a
custom
whereby
many
honourable
gentleman
of
my
country
have
much
benefit
!
)
;
guardian
,
and
ceremony
,
and
difficulty
of
all
kind
intervene
;
true
love
be
not
allow
to
have
its
course
,
and
poor
woman
can
not
give
away
their
honest
heart
to
the
gallant
fellow
who
have
win
them
.
<EOS>
now
it
be
settlement
that
be
ask
for
;
now
it
be
my
pedigree
and
title
-
deed
that
be
not
satisfactory
:
though
I
have
a
plan
and
rent
-
roll
of
the
Ballybarry
estate
,
and
the
genealogy
of
the
family
up
to
King
Brian
Boru
,
or
Barry
,
most
handsomely
design
on
paper
;
now
it
be
a
young
lady
who
be
whisk
off
to
a
convent
just
as
she
be
ready
to
fall
into
my
arm
;
on
another
occasion
,
when
a
rich
widow
of
the
Low
Countries
be
about
to
make
me
lord
of
a
noble
estate
in
flander
,
come
an
order
of
the
police
which
drive
me
out
of
Brussels
at
an
hour
's
notice
,
and
consign
my
mourner
to
her
chateau
.
<EOS>
but
at
X###I
have
an
opportunity
of
play
a
great
game
:
and
have
win
it
too
,
but
for
the
dreadful
catastrophe
which
upset
my
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
in
the
household
of
the
Hereditary
Princess
there
be
a
lady
nineteen
year
of
age
,
and
possessor
of
the
great
fortune
in
the
whole
duchy
.
<EOS>
the
Countess
Ida
,
such
be
her
name
,
be
daughter
of
a
late
Minister
and
favourite
of
his
Highness
the
Duke
of
X###and
<EOS>
his
Duchess
,
who
have
do
her
the
honour
to
be
her
sponsor
at
birth
,
and
who
,
at
the
father
's
death
,
have
take
her
under
their
august
guardianship
and
protection
.
<EOS>
at
sixteen
she
be
bring
from
her
castle
,
where
,
up
to
that
period
,
she
have
be
permit
to
reside
,
and
have
be
place
with
the
Princess
Olivia
,
as
one
of
her
Highness
's
maid
of
honour
.
  
<EOS>
the
aunt
of
the
Countess
Ida
,
who
preside
over
her
house
during
her
minority
,
have
foolishly
allow
her
to
contract
an
attachment
for
her
cousin
-
german
,
a
penniless
sub
-
lieutenant
in
one
of
the
Duke
's
foot
regiment
,
who
have
flatter
himself
to
be
able
to
carry
off
this
rich
prize
;
and
if
he
have
not
be
a
blunder
silly
idiot
indeed
,
with
the
advantage
of
see
her
constantly
,
of
have
no
rival
near
him
,
and
the
intimacy
attendant
upon
close
kinsmanship
,
<EOS>
may
easily
,
by
a
private
marriage
,
have
secure
the
young
Countess
and
her
possession
.
<EOS>
but
he
manage
matter
so
foolishly
,
that
he
allow
her
to
leave
her
retirement
,
to
come
to
Court
for
a
year
,
and
take
her
place
in
the
Princess
Olivia
's
household
;
and
then
what
do
my
young
gentleman
do
,
but
appear
at
the
Duke
's
levee
one
day
,
in
his
tarnished
epaulet
and
threadbare
coat
,
and
make
an
application
in
due
form
to
his
Highness
,
as
the
young
lady
's
guardian
,
for
the
hand
of
the
rich
heiress
in
his
dominion
!
  
<EOS>
the
weakness
of
the
good
-
natured
Prince
be
such
that
,
as
the
Countess
Ida
herself
be
quite
as
eager
for
the
match
as
her
silly
cousin
,
his
Highness
may
have
be
induce
to
allow
the
match
,
have
not
the
Princess
Olivia
be
induce
to
interpose
,
and
to
procure
from
the
Duke
a
peremptory
veto
to
the
hope
of
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
the
cause
of
this
refusal
be
as
yet
unknown
;
no
other
suitor
for
the
young
lady
's
hand
be
mention
,
and
the
lover
continue
to
correspond
,
hope
that
time
may
effect
a
change
in
his
Highness
's
resolution
;
when
,
of
a
sudden
,
the
lieutenant
be
draft
into
one
of
the
regiment
which
the
Prince
be
in
the
habit
of
sell
to
the
great
power
then
at
war
(
this
military
commerce
be
a
principal
part
of
his
Highness
's
and
other
prince
'
revenue
in
those
day
)
,
and
their
connection
be
thus
abruptly
break
off
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
strange
that
the
Princess
Olivia
should
have
take
this
part
against
a
young
lady
who
have
be
her
favourite
;
for
,
at
first
,
with
those
romantic
and
sentimental
notion
which
almost
every
woman
have
,
she
have
somewhat
encourage
the
Countess
Ida
and
her
penniless
lover
,
but
now
suddenly
turn
against
them
;
and
,
from
love
the
Countess
,
as
she
previously
have
do
,
pursue
her
with
every
manner
of
hatred
which
a
woman
know
how
to
inflict
:
<EOS>
there
be
no
end
to
the
ingenuity
of
her
torture
,
the
venom
of
her
tongue
,
the
bitterness
of
her
sarcasm
and
scorn
.
<EOS>
when
I
first
come
to
Court
at
X
 
,
the
young
fellow
there
have
nickname
the
young
lady
<EOS>
the
Dumme
Grafinn
,
the
stupid
Countess
.
<EOS>
She
be
generally
silent
,
handsome
,
but
pale
,
stolid
-
looking
,
and
awkward
;
take
no
interest
in
the
amusement
of
the
place
,
and
appear
in
the
midst
of
the
feast
as
glum
as
the
death's
-
head
which
,
they
say
,
the
Romans
use
to
have
at
their
table
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
rumour
that
a
young
gentleman
of
french
extraction
,
the
Chevalier
de
Magny
,
equerry
to
the
Hereditary
Prince
,
and
present
at
Paris
when
the
Princess
Olivia
be
married
to
him
by
proxy
there
,
be
the
intend
of
the
rich
Countess
Ida
;
but
no
official
declaration
of
the
kind
be
yet
make
,
and
there
be
whisper
of
a
dark
intrigue
:
which
,
subsequently
,
receive
frightful
confirmation
.
  
<EOS>
this
Chevalier
de
Magny
be
the
grandson
of
an
old
general
officer
in
the
Duke
's
service
,
the
Baron
de
Magny
.
<EOS>
the
Baron
's
father
have
quit
France
at
the
expulsion
of
Protestants
after
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
Nantes
,
and
take
service
in
X
 
,
where
he
die
.
<EOS>
the
son
succeed
him
,
and
,
quite
unlike
most
french
gentleman
of
birth
whom
I
have
know
,
be
a
stern
and
cold
Calvinist
,
rigid
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
,
retire
in
his
manner
,
mingle
little
with
the
Court
,
and
a
close
friend
and
favourite
of
Duke
Victor
;
whom
he
resemble
in
disposition
.
  
<EOS>
the
Chevalier
his
grandson
be
a
true
Frenchman
;
he
have
be
bear
in
France
,
where
his
father
hold
a
diplomatic
appointment
in
the
Duke
's
service
.
<EOS>
He
have
mingle
in
the
gay
society
of
the
most
brilliant
Court
in
the
world
,
and
have
endless
story
to
tell
us
of
the
pleasure
of
the
petite
maison
,
of
the
secret
of
the
Parc
aux
Cerfs
,
and
of
the
wild
gaiety
of
Richelieu
and
his
companion
.
<EOS>
He
have
be
almost
ruin
at
play
,
as
his
father
have
be
before
him
;
for
,
out
of
the
reach
of
the
stern
old
Baron
in
Germany
,
both
son
and
grandson
have
lead
the
most
reckless
of
life
.
<EOS>
He
come
back
from
Paris
soon
after
the
embassy
which
have
be
despatch
thither
on
the
occasion
of
the
marriage
of
the
Princess
,
be
receive
sternly
by
his
old
grandfather
;
who
,
however
,
pay
his
debt
once
more
,
and
procure
him
the
post
in
the
Duke
's
household
.
<EOS>
the
Chevalier
de
Magny
render
himself
a
great
favourite
of
his
august
master
;
he
bring
with
him
the
mode
and
the
gaiety
of
Paris
;
he
be
the
deviser
of
all
the
masquerade
and
ball
,
the
recruiter
of
the
ballet
-
dancer
,
and
by
far
the
most
brilliant
and
splendid
young
gentleman
of
the
Court
.
  
<EOS>
after
we
have
be
a
few
week
at
Ludwigslust
,
the
old
Baron
de
Magny
endeavour
to
have
us
dismiss
from
the
duchy
;
but
his
voice
be
not
strong
enough
to
overcome
that
of
the
general
public
,
and
the
Chevalier
de
Magny
especially
stand
our
friend
with
his
Highness
when
the
question
be
debate
before
him
.
<EOS>
the
Chevalier
's
love
of
play
have
not
desert
him
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
regular
frequenter
of
our
bank
,
where
he
play
for
some
time
with
pretty
good
luck
;
and
where
,
when
he
begin
to
lose
,
he
pay
with
a
regularity
surprising
to
all
those
who
know
the
smallness
of
his
mean
,
and
the
splendour
of
his
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
Her
Highness
the
Princess
Olivia
be
also
very
fond
of
play
.
<EOS>
on
half
-
a
-
dozen
occasion
when
we
hold
a
bank
at
Court
,
I
could
see
her
passion
for
the
game
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
 
that
is
,
my
cool
-
head
old
uncle
could
see
 
much
more
.
<EOS>
there
be
an
intelligence
between
Monsieur
de
Magny
and
this
illustrious
lady
.
<EOS>
"
if
her
Highness
be
not
in
love
with
the
little
Frenchman
,
"
my
uncle
say
to
me
one
night
after
play
,
"
may
I
lose
the
sight
of
my
last
eye
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
and
what
then
,
sir
?
"
say
I.
  
<EOS>
"
what
then
?
"
say
my
uncle
,
look
me
hard
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
"
be
you
so
green
as
not
to
know
what
then
?
<EOS>
Your
fortune
be
to
be
make
,
if
you
choose
to
back
it
now
;
and
we
may
have
back
the
Barry
estate
in
two
year
,
my
boy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
how
be
that
?
"
<EOS>
ask
I
,
still
at
a
loss
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
drily
say
,
"
get
Magny
to
play
;
never
mind
his
pay
:
take
his
note
of
hand
.
<EOS>
the
more
he
owe
the
well
;
but
,
above
all
,
make
him
play
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
can
not
pay
a
shilling
,
"
answer
I.
"
<EOS>
the
Jews
will
not
discount
his
note
at
cent
.
<EOS>
per
cent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
so
much
the
well
.
<EOS>
You
shall
see
we
will
make
use
of
them
,
"
answer
the
old
gentleman
.
<EOS>
and
I
must
confess
that
the
plan
he
lay
be
a
gallant
,
clever
,
and
fair
one
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
to
make
Magny
play
;
in
this
there
be
no
great
difficulty
.
<EOS>
We
have
an
intimacy
together
,
for
he
be
a
good
sportsman
as
well
as
myself
,
and
we
come
to
have
a
pretty
considerable
friendship
for
one
another
;
if
he
see
a
dice
-
box
it
be
impossible
to
prevent
him
from
handle
it
;
but
he
take
to
it
as
natural
as
a
child
do
to
sweetmeat
.
  
<EOS>
at
first
he
win
of
me
;
then
he
begin
to
lose
;
then
I
play
him
money
against
some
jewel
that
he
bring
:
<EOS>
family
trinket
,
he
say
,
and
indeed
of
considerable
value
.
<EOS>
He
beg
me
,
however
,
not
to
dispose
of
them
in
the
duchy
,
and
I
give
and
keep
my
word
to
him
to
this
effect
.
<EOS>
from
jewel
he
get
to
play
upon
promissory
note
;
and
as
they
would
not
allow
him
to
play
at
the
Court
table
and
in
public
upon
credit
,
he
be
very
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
of
indulge
his
favourite
passion
in
private
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
him
for
hour
at
my
pavilion
(
which
I
have
fit
up
in
the
eastern
manner
,
very
splendid
)
rattle
the
dice
till
it
become
time
to
go
to
his
service
at
Court
,
and
we
would
spend
day
after
day
in
this
manner
.
<EOS>
He
bring
me
more
jewel
,
 
a
pearl
necklace
,
an
antique
emerald
breast
ornament
,
and
other
trinket
,
as
a
set
-
off
against
these
loss
:
for
I
need
not
say
that
I
should
not
have
play
with
him
all
this
time
have
he
be
win
;
but
,
after
about
a
week
,
the
luck
set
in
against
him
,
and
he
become
my
debtor
in
a
prodigious
sum
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
to
mention
the
extent
of
it
;
it
be
such
as
I
never
think
the
young
man
could
pay
.
  
<EOS>
why
,
then
,
do
I
play
for
it
?
<EOS>
why
waste
day
in
private
play
with
a
mere
bankrupt
,
when
business
seemingly
much
more
profitable
be
to
be
do
elsewhere
?
<EOS>
My
reason
I
boldly
confess
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
win
from
Monsieur
de
Magny
,
not
his
money
,
but
his
intend
wife
,
the
Countess
Ida
.
<EOS>
who
can
say
that
I
have
not
a
right
to
use
any
stratagem
in
this
matter
of
love
?
<EOS>
or
,
why
say
love
?
<EOS>
I
want
the
wealth
of
the
lady
:
I
love
her
quite
as
much
as
Magny
do
;
I
love
her
quite
as
much
as
yonder
blush
virgin
of
seventeen
<EOS>
do
who
marry
an
old
lord
of
seventy
.
<EOS>
I
follow
the
practice
of
the
world
in
this
;
have
resolve
that
marriage
should
achieve
my
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
I
use
to
make
Magny
<EOS>
,
after
his
loss
,
give
me
a
friendly
letter
of
acknowledgment
to
some
such
effect
as
this
,
    
"
my
dear
MONSIEUR
DE
BALIBARI
,
 
I
acknowledge
to
have
lose
to
you
this
day
at
lansquenet
[
or
picquet
,
or
hazard
,
as
the
case
may
be
:
I
be
master
of
him
at
any
game
that
be
play
]
the
sum
of
three
hundred
ducat
,
and
shall
hold
it
as
a
great
kindness
on
your
part
if
you
will
allow
the
debt
to
stand
over
until
a
future
day
,
when
you
shall
receive
payment
from
your
very
grateful
humble
servant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
with
the
jewel
he
bring
me
<EOS>
I
also
take
the
precaution
<EOS>
(
but
this
be
my
uncle
's
idea
,
and
a
very
good
one
)
to
have
a
sort
of
invoice
,
and
a
letter
beg
me
to
receive
the
trinket
as
so
much
part
payment
of
a
sum
of
money
he
owe
me
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
have
put
him
in
such
a
position
as
I
deem
favourable
to
my
intention
,
I
speak
to
him
candidly
,
and
without
any
reserve
,
as
one
man
of
the
world
should
speak
to
another
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
say
I
,
"
pay
you
so
bad
<EOS>
a
compliment
as
to
suppose
that
you
expect
we
be
to
go
on
playing
at
this
rate
much
longer
,
and
that
there
be
any
satisfaction
to
me
in
possess
more
or
less

your
signature

and
a
series
of
note
of
hand
which
<EOS>
I
know
you
never
can
pay
.
<EOS>
do
not
look
fierce
or
angry
,
for
you
know
<EOS>
Redmond
Barry
be
your
master
at
the
sword
;
besides
,
I
would
not
be
such
a
fool
as
to
fight
a
man
who
owe
me
so
much
money
;
but
hear
calmly
what
I
have
to
propose
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
be
very
confidential
to
me
during
our
intimacy
of
the
last
month
;
and
I
know
all
your
personal
affair
completely
.
<EOS>
You
have
give
your
word
of
honour
to
your
grandfather
never
to
play
upon
parole
,
and
you
know
how
you
have
keep
it
,
and
that
he
will
disinherit
you
if
he
hear
the
truth
.
<EOS>
nay
,
suppose
he
die
to
-
morrow
,
his
estate
be
not
sufficient
to
pay
the
sum
in
which
you
be
indebted
to
me
;
and
,
be
you
to
yield
me
up
all
,
you
would
be
a
beggar
,
and
a
bankrupt
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
Highness
the
Princess
Olivia
deny
you
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
ask
why
;
but
give
me
leave
to
say
,
<EOS>
I
be
aware
of
the
fact
when
we
begin
to
play
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
be
make
baron
-
chamberlain
,
with
the
grand
cordon
of
the
order
?
"
gasp
the
poor
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Princess
can
do
anything
with
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
no
objection
,
"
say
I
,
"
to
the
yellow
riband
and
the
gold
key
;
though
a
gentleman
of
the
house
of
Ballybarry
care
little
for
the
title
of
the
german
nobility
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
not
what
I
want
.
<EOS>
My
good
Chevalier
,
you
have
hide
no
secret
from
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
tell
me
with
what
difficulty
you
have
induce
the
Princess
Olivia
to
consent
to
the
project
of
your
union
with
the
Grafinn
Ida
,
whom
you
do
not
love
.
<EOS>
I
know
whom
you
love
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
de
Balibari
!
<EOS>
"
say
the
discomfited
Chevalier
;
he
could
get
out
no
more
.
<EOS>
the
truth
begin
to
dawn
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
begin
to
understand
,
"
continued
I.
"
Her
Highness
the
Princess
"
<EOS>
(
I
say
this
in
a
sarcastic
way
)
<EOS>
"
will
not
be
very
angry
,
believe
me
,
if
you
break
off
your
connection
with
the
stupid
Countess
.
<EOS>
I
be
no
more
an
admirer
of
that
lady
than
you
be
;
but
I
want
her
estate
.
<EOS>
I
play
you
for
that
estate
,
and
have
win
it
;
and
I
will
give
you
your
bill
and
five
thousand
ducat
on
the
day
I
be
married
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
the
day
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
be
married
to
the
Countess

"
answer
the
Chevalier
,
think
to
have
me
,
"
I
will
be
able
to
raise
money
to
pay
your
claim
ten
time
over
"
(
this
be
true
,
for
the
Countess
's
property
may
have
be
value
at
near
half
a
million
of
our
money
)
;
"
and
then
I
will
discharge
my
obligation
to
you
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
if
you
annoy
me
by
threat
,
or
insult
me
again
as
you
have
do
,
I
will
use
that
influence
,
which
,
as
you
say
,
I
possess
,
and
have
you
turn
out
of
the
duchy
,
as
you
be
out
of
the
Netherlands
last
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
ring
the
bell
quite
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Zamor
,
"
say
I
to
a
tall
negro
fellow
habit
like
a
Turk
,
that
use
to
wait
upon
me
,
"
when
you
hear
the
bell
re
a
second
time
,
you
will
take
this
packet
to
the
Marshal
of
the
Court
,
this
to
his
Excellency
the
General
de
Magny
,
and
this
you
will
place
in
the
hand
of
one
of
the
equerry
of
his
Highness
the
Hereditary
Prince
.
<EOS>
wait
in
the
ante
-
room
,
and
do
not
go
with
the
parcel
until
I
ring
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
black
fellow
have
retire
,
I
turn
to
Monsieur
de
Magny
and
say
,
"
Chevalier
,
the
first
packet
contain
a
letter
from
you
to
me
,
declare
your
solvency
,
and
solemnly
promise
payment
of
the
sum
you
owe
me
;
it
be
accompany
by
a
document
from
myself
(
for
I
expect
some
resistance
on
your
part
)
,
state
that
my
honour
have
be
call
in
question
,
and
beg
that
the
paper
may
be
lay
before
your
august
master
his
Highness
.
<EOS>
the
second
packet
be
for
your
grandfather
,
enclose
the
letter
from
you
in
which
you
state
yourself
to
be
his
heir
,
and
beg
for
a
confirmation
of
the
fact
.
<EOS>
the
last
parcel
,
for
his
Highness
the
Hereditary
Duke
,
"
add
I
,
look
most
sternly
,
"
contain
the
Gustavus
Adolphus
emerald
,
which
he
give
to
his
princess
,
and
which
you
pledge
to
me
as
a
family
jewel
of
your
own
.
<EOS>
Your
influence
with
her
Highness
must
be
great
indeed
,
"
<EOS>
I
conclude
,
"
when
you
could
extort
from
her
such
a
jewel
as
that
,
and
when
you
could
make
her
,
in
order
to
pay
your
play
-
debt
,
give
up
a
secret
upon
which
both
your
head
depend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Villain
!
"
say
the
Frenchman
,
quite
aghast
with
fury
and
terror
,
"
would
you
implicate
the
Princess
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Monsieur
de
Magny
,
"
I
answer
,
with
a
sneer
,
"
no
:
I
will
say
you
steal
the
jewel
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
belief
he
do
,
and
that
the
unhappy
and
infatuate
Princess
be
never
privy
to
the
theft
until
long
after
it
have
be
commit
.
<EOS>
how
we
come
to
know
the
history
of
the
emerald
be
simple
enough
.
<EOS>
as
we
want
money
(
for
my
occupation
with
Magny
cause
our
bank
to
be
much
neglect
)
,
my
uncle
have
carry
Magny
's
trinket
to
Mannheim
to
pawn
.
<EOS>
the
Jew
who
lend
upon
them
know
the
history
of
the
stone
in
question
;
and
when
he
ask
how
her
Highness
come
to
part
with
it
,
my
uncle
very
cleverly
take
up
the
story
where
he
find
it
,
say
that
the
Princess
be
very
fond
of
play
,
that
it
be
not
always
convenient
to
her
to
pay
,
and
hence
the
emerald
have
come
into
our
hand
.
<EOS>
He
bring
it
wisely
back
with
him
to
S
 
;
and
,
as
regard
the
other
jewel
which
the
Chevalier
pawn
to
us
,
they
be
of
no
particular
mark
:
no
inquiry
have
ever
be
make
about
them
to
this
day
;
and
I
do
not
only
not
know
then
that
they
come
from
her
Highness
,
but
have
only
my
conjecture
upon
the
matter
now
.
  
<EOS>
the
unfortunate
young
gentleman
must
have
have
a
cowardly
spirit
,
when
I
charge
him
with
the
theft
,
not
to
make
use
of
my
two
pistol
that
be
lie
by
chance
before
him
,
and
to
send
out
of
the
world
his
accuser
and
his
own
ruined
self
.
<EOS>
with
such
imprudence
and
miserable
recklessness
on
his
part
and
that
of
the
unhappy
lady
who
have
forget
herself
for
this
poor
villain
,
he
must
have
know
that
discovery
be
inevitable
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
write
that
this
dreadful
destiny
should
be
accomplish
:
instead
of
end
like
a
man
,
he
now
cower
before
me
quite
spirit
-
break
,
and
,
fling
himself
down
on
the
sofa
,
burst
into
tear
,
call
wildly
upon
all
the
saint
to
help
him
:
as
if
they
could
be
interested
in
the
fate
of
such
a
wretch
as
he
!
  
<EOS>
I
see
that
I
have
nothing
to
fear
from
him
;
and
,
call
back
Zamor
my
black
,
say
I
would
myself
carry
the
parcel
,
which
I
return
to
my
escritoire
;
and
,
my
point
be
thus
gain
,
I
act
,
as
I
always
do
,
generously
towards
him
.
<EOS>
I
say
that
,
for
security
's
sake
,
I
should
send
the
emerald
out
of
the
country
,
but
that
I
pledge
my
honour
to
restore
it
to
the
Duchess
,
without
any
pecuniary
consideration
,
on
the
day
when
she
should
procure
the
sovereign
's
consent
to
my
union
with
the
Countess
Ida
.
  
<EOS>
this
will
explain
pretty
clearly
,
I
flatter
myself
,
the
game
I
be
play
;
and
,
though
some
rigid
moralist
may
object
to
its
propriety
<EOS>
,
I
say
that
anything
be
fair
in
love
,
and
that
man
so
poor
as
myself
can
not
afford
to
be
squeamish
about
their
mean
of
get
on
in
life
.
<EOS>
the
great
and
rich
be
welcome
,
smile
,
up
the
grand
staircase
of
the
world
;
the
poor
but
aspire
must
clamber
up
the
wall
,
or
push
and
struggle
up
the
back
stair
,
or
,
PARDI
,
crawl
through
any
of
the
conduit
of
the
house
,
<EOS>
never
mind
how
foul
and
narrow
,
that
lead
to
the
top
.
<EOS>
the
unambitious
sluggard
pretend
that
the
eminence
be
not
worth
attaining
,
decline
altogether
the
struggle
,
and
call
himself
a
philosopher
.
<EOS>
I
say
he
be
a
poor
-
spirited
coward
.
<EOS>
what
be
life
good
for
but
for
honour
?
<EOS>
and
that
be
so
indispensable
,
that
we
should
attain
it
anyhow
.
  
<EOS>
the
manner
to
be
adopt
for
Magny
's
retreat
be
propose
by
myself
,
and
be
arrange
so
as
to
consult
the
feeling
of
delicacy
of
both
party
.
<EOS>
I
make
Magny
take
the
Countess
Ida
aside
,
and
say
to
her
,
"
Madam
,
though
I
have
never
declare
myself
your
admirer
,
you
and
the
Court
have
have
sufficient
proof
of
my
regard
for
you
;
and
my
demand
would
,
I
know
,
have
be
back
by
his
Highness
,
your
august
guardian
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
Duke
's
gracious
wish
be
,
that
my
attention
should
be
receive
favourably
;
<EOS>
but
,
as
time
have
not
appear
to
alter
your
attachment
elsewhere
,
and
as
I
have
too
much
spirit
to
force
a
lady
of
your
name
and
rank
to
be
unite
to
me
against
your
will
,
the
good
plan
be
,
that
I
should
make
you
,
for
form
's
sake
,
a
proposal
unauthorise
by
his
Highness
:
that
you
should
reply
,
as
I
be
sorry
to
think
your
heart
dictate
to
you
,
in
the
negative
:
on
which
I
also
will
formally
withdraw
from
my
pursuit
of
you
,
state
that
,
after
a
refusal
,
nothing
,
not
even
the
Duke
's
desire
,
should
induce
me
to
persist
in
my
suit
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
Countess
Ida
almost
weep
at
hear
these
word
from
Monsieur
de
Magny
,
and
tear
come
into
her
eye
,
he
say
,
as
she
take
his
hand
for
the
first
time
,
and
thank
him
for
the
delicacy
of
the
proposal
.
<EOS>
She
little
know
that
the
Frenchman
be
incapable
of
that
sort
of
delicacy
,
and
that
the
graceful
manner
in
which
he
withdraw
his
address
be
of
my
invention
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
he
withdraw
,
it
become
my
business
to
step
forward
;
but
cautiously
and
gently
,
so
as
not
to
alarm
the
lady
,
and
yet
firmly
,
so
as
to
convince
her
of
the
hopelessness
of
her
design
of
unite
herself
with
her
shabby
lover
,
the
sub
-
lieutenant
.
<EOS>
the
Princess
Olivia
be
good
enough
to
perform
this
necessary
part
of
the
plan
in
my
favour
,
and
solemnly
to
warn
the
Countess
Ida
,
that
,
though
Monsieur
de
Magny
have
retire
from
pay
his
address
,
his
Highness
her
guardian
would
still
marry
her
as
he
think
fit
,
and
that
she
must
for
ever
forget
her
out
-
at
-
elbow
adorer
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
I
can
not
conceive
how
such
a
shabby
rogue
as
that
could
ever
have
have
the
audacity
to
propose
for
her
:
his
birth
be
certainly
good
;
but
what
other
qualification
have
he
?
  
<EOS>
when
the
Chevalier
de
Magny
withdraw
,
number
of
other
suitor
,
you
may
be
sure
,
present
themselves
;
and
amongst
these
your
very
humble
servant
,
the
cadet
of
Ballybarry
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
carrousel
,
or
tournament
,
hold
at
this
period
,
in
imitation
of
the
antique
meeting
of
chivalry
,
in
which
the
chevalier
tilt
at
each
other
,
or
at
the
ring
;
and
on
this
occasion
I
be
habit
in
a
splendid
roman
dress
(
viz
.
,
a
silver
helmet
,
a
flow
periwig
,
a
cuirass
of
gilt
leather
richly
embroider
,
a
light
blue
velvet
mantle
,
and
crimson
morocco
half
-
boot
)
:
<EOS>
and
in
this
habit
I
ride
<EOS>
my
bay
horse
Brian
,
carry
off
three
ring
,
and
win
the
prize
over
all
the
Duke
's
gentry
,
and
the
nobility
of
surround
country
who
have
come
to
the
show
.
<EOS>
a
wreath
of
gild
laurel
be
to
be
the
prize
of
the
victor
,
and
it
be
to
be
award
by
the
lady
he
select
.
<EOS>
so
I
ride
up
to
the
gallery
where
the
Countess
Ida
be
seat
behind
the
Hereditary
Princess
,
and
,
call
her
name
loudly
,
yet
gracefully
,
beg
to
be
allow
to
be
crown
by
her
,
and
thus
proclaim
myself
to
the
face
of
all
Germany
,
as
it
be
,
her
suitor
.
<EOS>
She
turn
very
pale
,
and
the
Princess
red
,
I
observe
;
but
the
Countess
Ida
end
by
crown
me
:
after
which
,
put
spur
into
my
horse
<EOS>
,
I
gallop
round
the
ring
,
salute
his
Highness
the
Duke
at
the
opposite
end
,
and
perform
the
most
wonderful
exercise
with
my
bay
.
  
<EOS>
My
success
do
not
,
as
you
may
imagine
,
increase
my
popularity
with
the
young
gentry
.
<EOS>
They
call
me
adventurer
,
bully
,
dice
-
loader
,
impostor
,
and
a
hundred
pretty
name
;
but
I
have
a
way
of
silence
these
gentry
.
<EOS>
I
take
the
Count
de
Schmetterling
,
the
rich
and
brave
of
the
young
man
who
seem
to
have
a
hankering
for
the
Countess
Ida
,
and
publicly
insult
him
at
the
ridotto
;
fling
my
card
into
his
face
.
<EOS>
the
next
day
I
ride
thirty
-
five
mile
into
the
territory
of
the
elector
of
B
#
#
#
#
,
and
meet
Monsieur
de
Schmetterling
,
and
pass
my
sword
twice
through
his
body
;
then
ride
back
with
my
second
,
the
Chevalier
de
Magny
,
and
present
myself
at
the
Duchess
's
whist
that
evening
.
<EOS>
Magny
be
very
unwilling
to
accompany
me
at
first
;
but
I
insist
upon
his
support
,
and
that
he
should
countenance
my
quarrel
.
<EOS>
directly
after
pay
my
homage
to
her
Highness
,
I
go
up
to
the
Countess
Ida
,
and
make
her
a
marked
and
low
obeisance
,
gaze
at
her
steadily
in
the
face
until
she
grow
crimson
red
;
and
then
stare
round
at
every
man
who
form
her
circle
,
until
,
MA
FOI
,
I
stare
them
all
away
.
<EOS>
I
instruct
Magny
to
say
,
everywhere
,
that
the
Countess
be
madly
in
love
with
me
;
which
commission
,
along
with
many
other
of
mine
,
the
poor
devil
be
oblige
to
perform
.
<EOS>
He
make
rather
a
sotte
FIGURE
,
as
the
French
say
,
act
the
pioneer
for
me
,
praise
me
everywhere
,
accompany
me
always
!
<EOS>
he
who
have
be
the
pink
of
the
mode
until
my
arrival
;
he
who
think
his
pedigree
of
beggarly
Barons
of
Magny
be
superior
to
the
race
of
great
irish
king
from
which
I
descend
;
who
have
sneer
at
me
a
hundred
time
as
a
spadassin
,
a
deserter
,
and
have
call
me
a
vulgar
irish
upstart
.
<EOS>
now
I
have
my
revenge
of
the
gentleman
,
and
take
it
too
.
  
<EOS>
I
use
to
call
him
,
in
the
choice
society
,
by
his
christian
name
of
Maxime
.
<EOS>
I
would
say
,
"
bon
jour
,
maxime
;
comment
vas
-
TU
?
"
<EOS>
in
the
Princess
's
hearing
,
and
could
see
him
bite
his
lip
for
fury
and
vexation
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
him
under
my
thumb
,
and
her
Highness
too
 
I
,
poor
private
of
Bulow
's
regiment
.
<EOS>
and
this
be
a
proof
of
what
genius
and
perseverance
can
do
,
and
should
act
as
a
warning
to
great
people
never
to
have
secret
 
if
they
can
help
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
the
Princess
hate
me
;
but
what
do
I
care
?
<EOS>
She
know
I
know
all
:
and
indeed
,
I
believe
,
so
strong
be
her
prejudice
against
me
,
that
she
think
I
be
an
indelicate
villain
,
capable
of
betray
a
lady
,
which
I
would
scorn
to
do
;
so
that
she
tremble
before
me
as
a
child
before
its
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
She
would
,
in
her
woman
's
way
,
too
,
make
all
sort
of
joke
and
sneer
at
me
on
reception
day
;
ask
about
my
palace
in
Ireland
,
and
the
king
my
ancestor
,
and
whether
,
when
I
be
a
private
in
Bulow
's
foot
,
my
royal
relative
have
interpose
to
rescue
me
,
and
whether
the
cane
be
smartly
administer
there
,
 
anything
to
mortify
me
.
<EOS>
but
,
Heaven
bless
you
!
<EOS>
I
can
make
allowance
for
people
,
and
use
to
laugh
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
whilst
her
jibe
and
jeer
be
continue
,
it
be
my
pleasure
to
look
at
poor
Magny
and
see
how
he
bear
them
.
<EOS>
the
poor
devil
be
tremble
lest
I
should
break
out
under
the
Princess
's
sarcasm
and
tell
all
;
but
my
revenge
be
,
when
the
Princess
attack
me
,
to
say
something
bitter
to
him
,
 
to
pass
it
on
,
as
boy
do
at
school
.
<EOS>
and
that
be
the
thing
which
use
to
make
her
Highness
feel
.
<EOS>
She
would
wince
just
as
much
when
I
attack
Magny
as
if
I
have
be
say
anything
rude
to
herself
.
<EOS>
and
,
though
she
hate
me
,
she
use
to
beg
my
pardon
in
private
;
and
though
her
pride
would
often
get
the
well
of
her
,
yet
her
prudence
oblige
this
magnificent
princess
to
humble
herself
to
the
poor
penniless
irish
boy
.
  
<EOS>
as
soon
as
Magny
have
formally
withdraw
from
the
Countess
Ida
,
the
Princess
take
the
young
lady
into
favour
again
,
and
pretend
to
be
very
fond
of
her
.
<EOS>
to
do
them
justice
,
I
do
not
know
which
of
the
two
dislike
me
most
,
 
<EOS>
the
Princess
,
who
be
all
eagerness
,
and
fire
,
and
coquetry
;
or
the
Countess
,
who
be
all
state
and
splendour
.
<EOS>
the
latter
,
especially
,
pretend
to
be
disgust
by
me
:
and
yet
,
after
all
,
I
have
please
her
better
;
be
once
one
of
the
handsome
man
in
Europe
,
and
would
defy
any
heyduc
of
the
Court
to
measure
a
chest
or
a
leg
with
me
:
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
care
for
any
of
her
silly
prejudice
,
and
determine
to
win
her
and
wear
her
in
spite
of
herself
.
<EOS>
be
it
on
account
of
her
personal
charm
or
quality
?
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
She
be
quite
white
,
thin
,
short
-
sighted
,
tall
,
and
awkward
,
and
my
taste
be
quite
the
contrary
;
and
as
for
her
mind
,
no
wonder
that
a
poor
creature
who
have
a
hankering
after
a
wretched
ragged
ensign
could
never
appreciate
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
her
estate
I
make
love
to
;
as
for
herself
,
it
would
be
a
reflection
on
my
taste
as
a
man
of
fashion
to
own
that
I
like
her
.
   
<EOS>
in
which
the
luck
go
against
BARRY
 
<EOS>
My
hope
of
obtain
the
hand
of
one
of
the
rich
heiress
in
Germany
be
now
,
as
far
as
all
human
probability
go
,
and
as
far
as
my
own
merit
and
prudence
could
secure
my
fortune
,
pretty
certain
of
completion
.
<EOS>
I
be
admit
whenever
I
present
myself
at
the
Princess
's
apartment
,
and
have
as
frequent
opportunity
as
I
desire
of
see
the
Countess
Ida
there
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
she
receive
me
with
any
particular
favour
;
the
silly
young
creature
's
affection
be
,
as
I
have
say
,
engage
ignobly
elsewhere
;
and
,
however
captivate
my
own
person
and
manner
may
have
be
,
it
be
not
to
be
expect
<EOS>
that
she
should
all
of
a
sudden
forget
her
lover
for
the
sake
of
the
young
irish
gentleman
who
be
pay
his
address
to
her
.
<EOS>
but
such
little
rebuff
as
I
get
be
far
from
discourage
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
very
powerful
friend
,
who
be
to
aid
me
in
my
undertaking
;
and
know
that
,
sooner
or
later
,
the
victory
must
be
mine
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
I
only
wait
my
time
to
press
my
suit
.
<EOS>
who
could
tell
the
dreadful
stroke
of
fortune
which
be
impend
over
my
illustrious
protectress
,
and
which
be
to
involve
me
partially
in
her
ruin
?
  
<EOS>
all
thing
seem
for
a
while
quite
prosperous
to
my
wish
;
and
in
spite
of
the
Countess
Ida
's
disinclination
,
it
be
much
easy
to
bring
her
to
her
sense
than
<EOS>
,
perhaps
,
may
be
suppose
in
a
silly
constitutional
country
like
England
,
where
people
be
not
bring
up
with
those
wholesome
sentiment
of
obedience
to
royalty
which
be
customary
in
Europe
at
the
time
when
I
be
a
young
man
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
state
how
,
through
Magny
,
I
have
the
Princess
,
as
it
be
,
at
my
foot
.
<EOS>
Her
Highness
have
only
to
press
the
match
upon
the
old
Duke
,
over
whom
her
influence
be
unbounded
,
and
to
secure
the
goodwill
of
the
Countess
of
Liliengarten
,
(
which
be
the
romantic
title
of
his
Highness
's
morganatic
spouse
)
,
and
the
easy
old
man
would
give
an
order
for
the
marriage
:
which
his
ward
would
perforce
obey
.
<EOS>
Madame
de
Liliengarten
be
,
too
,
from
her
position
,
extremely
anxious
to
oblige
the
Princess
Olivia
;
who
may
be
call
upon
any
day
to
occupy
the
throne
.
<EOS>
the
old
Duke
be
totter
,
apoplectic
,
and
exceedingly
fond
of
good
living
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
go
,
his
relict
would
find
the
patronage
of
the
Duchess
Olivia
most
necessary
to
her
.
<EOS>
hence
there
be
a
close
mutual
understanding
between
the
two
lady
;
and
the
world
say
that
the
Hereditary
Princess
be
already
indebte
to
the
favourite
for
help
on
various
occasion
.
<EOS>
Her
Highness
have
obtain
,
through
the
Countess
,
several
large
grant
of
money
for
the
payment
of
her
multifarious
debt
;
and
she
be
now
good
enough
to
exert
her
gracious
influence
over
Madame
de
Liliengarten
in
order
to
obtain
for
me
the
object
so
near
my
heart
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
to
be
suppose
that
my
end
be
to
be
obtain
without
continual
unwillingness
and
refusal
on
Magny
's
part
;
but
I
push
my
point
resolutely
,
and
have
mean
in
my
hand
of
overcome
the
stubbornness
of
that
feeble
young
gentleman
.
<EOS>
also
,
I
may
say
,
without
vanity
,
that
if
the
high
and
mighty
Princess
detest
me
,
the
Countess
(
though
she
be
of
extremely
low
origin
,
it
be
say
)
have
well
taste
and
admire
me
.
<EOS>
She
often
do
us
the
honour
to
go
partner
with
us
in
one
of
our
faro
-
bank
,
and
declare
that
I
be
the
handsome
man
in
the
duchy
.
<EOS>
all
I
be
require
to
prove
be
my
nobility
,
and
I
get
at
Vienna
such
a
pedigree
as
would
satisfy
the
most
greedy
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
what
have
a
man
descend
from
the
Barrys
and
the
Bradys
to
fear
before
any
VON
in
Germany
?
<EOS>
by
way
of
make
assurance
doubly
sure
,
I
promise
Madame
de
Liliengarten
ten
thousand
louis
on
the
day
of
my
marriage
,
and
she
know
that
as
a
play
-
man
I
have
never
fail
in
my
word
:
<EOS>
and
I
vow
,
<EOS>
that
have
I
pay
fifty
per
cent
.
<EOS>
for
it
,
I
would
have
get
the
money
.
  
<EOS>
thus
by
my
talent
,
honesty
,
and
acuteness
,
I
have
,
consider
I
be
a
poor
patronless
outcast
,
raise
for
myself
very
powerful
protector
.
<EOS>
even
his
Highness
the
Duke
Victor
be
favourably
inclined
to
me
;
for
,
his
favourite
charger
fall
ill
of
the
stagger
,
I
give
him
a
ball
such
as
my
uncle
Brady
use
to
administer
,
and
cure
the
horse
;
after
which
his
Highness
be
pleased
to
notice
me
frequently
.
<EOS>
He
invite
me
to
his
hunting
and
shooting
party
,
where
I
show
myself
to
be
a
good
sportsman
;
and
once
or
twice
he
condescend
to
talk
to
me
about
my
prospect
in
life
,
lament
that
I
have
take
to
gambling
,
and
that
I
have
not
adopt
a
more
regular
mean
of
advancement
.
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
I
,
"
if
you
will
allow
me
to
speak
frankly
to
your
Highness
,
play
with
me
be
only
a
means
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
where
should
I
have
be
without
it
?
<EOS>
a
private
still
in
King
Frederick
's
grenadier
.
<EOS>
I
come
of
a
race
which
give
prince
to
my
country
;
but
persecution
have
deprive
them
of
their
vast
possession
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
's
adherence
to
his
ancient
faith
drive
him
from
our
country
.
<EOS>
I
too
resolve
to
seek
advancement
in
the
military
service
;
but
the
insolence
and
ill
-
treatment
which
I
receive
at
the
hand
of
the
English
be
not
bearable
by
a
high
-
bear
gentleman
,
and
I
flee
their
service
.
<EOS>
It
be
only
to
fall
into
another
bondage
to
all
appearance
still
more
hopeless
;
when
my
good
star
send
a
preserver
to
me
in
my
uncle
,
and
my
spirit
and
gallantry
enable
me
to
take
advantage
of
the
mean
of
escape
afford
me
.
<EOS>
since
then
we
have
live
,
I
do
not
disguise
it
,
by
play
;
but
who
can
say
I
have
do
him
a
wrong
?
<EOS>
yet
,
if
I
could
find
myself
in
an
honourable
post
,
and
with
an
assure
maintenance
,
I
would
never
,
except
for
amusement
,
such
as
every
gentleman
must
have
,
touch
a
card
again
.
<EOS>
I
beseech
your
Highness
to
inquire
of
your
resident
at
Berlin
if
I
do
not
on
every
occasion
act
as
a
gallant
soldier
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
have
talent
of
a
high
order
,
and
should
be
proud
to
have
occasion
to
exert
them
;
if
,
as
I
do
not
doubt
,
my
fortune
shall
bring
them
into
play
.
"
  
<EOS>
the
candour
of
this
statement
strike
his
Highness
greatly
,
and
impress
him
in
my
favour
,
and
he
be
pleased
to
say
that
he
believe
me
,
and
would
be
glad
to
stand
my
friend
.
  
<EOS>
have
thus
the
two
Dukes
,
the
Duchess
,
and
the
reign
favourite
enlist
on
my
side
,
the
chance
certainly
be
that
I
should
carry
off
the
great
prize
;
and
I
ought
,
accord
to
all
common
calculation
,
to
have
be
a
Prince
of
the
Empire
at
this
present
writing
,
but
that
my
ill
luck
pursue
me
in
a
matter
in
which
I
be
not
the
least
to
blame
,
 
the
unhappy
Duchess
's
attachment
to
the
weak
,
silly
,
cowardly
Frenchman
.
<EOS>
the
display
of
this
love
be
painful
to
witness
,
as
its
end
be
frightful
to
think
of
.
<EOS>
the
Princess
make
no
disguise
of
it
.
<EOS>
if
Magny
speak
a
word
to
a
lady
of
her
household
,
she
would
be
jealous
,
and
attack
with
all
the
fury
of
her
tongue
the
unlucky
offender
.
<EOS>
She
would
send
him
a
half
-
dozen
of
note
in
the
day
:
at
his
arrival
to
join
her
circle
or
the
court
which
she
hold
,
she
would
brighten
up
,
so
that
all
may
perceive
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
wonder
that
her
husband
have
not
long
ere
this
be
make
aware
of
her
faithlessness
;
but
the
Prince
Victor
be
himself
of
so
high
and
stern
a
nature
that
he
could
not
believe
in
her
stooping
so
far
from
her
rank
as
to
forget
her
virtue
:
and
I
have
hear
say
,
that
when
hint
be
give
to
him
of
the
evident
partiality
which
the
Princess
show
for
the
equerry
,
his
answer
be
a
stern
command
never
more
to
be
trouble
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Princess
be
light
-
minded
,
"
he
say
;
"
she
be
bring
up
at
a
frivolous
Court
;
but
her
folly
go
not
beyond
coquetry
:
crime
be
impossible
;
she
have
her
birth
,
and
my
name
,
and
her
child
,
to
defend
her
.
"
<EOS>
and
he
would
ride
off
to
his
military
inspection
and
be
absent
for
week
,
or
retire
to
his
suite
of
apartment
,
and
remain
closet
there
whole
day
;
only
appear
to
make
a
bow
at
her
Highness
's
levee
,
or
to
give
her
his
hand
at
the
Court
gala
,
where
ceremony
require
that
he
should
appear
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
man
of
vulgar
taste
,
and
I
have
see
him
in
the
private
garden
,
with
his
great
ungainly
figure
,
running
race
,
or
play
at
ball
with
his
little
son
and
daughter
,
whom
he
would
find
a
dozen
pretexts
daily
for
visit
.
<EOS>
the
serene
child
be
bring
to
their
mother
every
morning
at
her
toilette
;
but
she
receive
them
very
indifferently
:
except
on
one
occasion
,
when
the
young
Duke
Ludwig
get
his
little
uniform
as
colonel
of
hussars
,
be
present
with
a
regiment
by
his
godfather
the
Emperor
Leopold
.
<EOS>
then
,
for
a
day
or
two
,
the
Duchess
Olivia
be
charm
with
the
little
boy
;
but
she
grow
tired
of
him
speedily
,
as
a
child
do
of
a
toy
.
<EOS>
I
remember
one
day
,
in
the
morning
circle
,
some
of
the
Princess
's
rouge
come
off
on
the
arm
of
her
son
's
little
white
military
jacket
;
on
which
she
slap
the
poor
child
's
face
,
and
send
him
sob
away
.
<EOS>
oh
,
the
woe
that
have
be
work
by
woman
in
this
world
!
<EOS>
the
misery
into
which
man
have
lightly
step
with
smile
face
;
often
not
even
with
the
excuse
of
passion
,
but
from
mere
foppery
,
vanity
,
and
bravado
!
<EOS>
man
play
with
these
dreadful
two
-
edge
tool
,
as
if
no
harm
could
come
to
them
.
<EOS>
I
,
who
have
see
more
of
life
than
most
man
,
if
I
have
a
son
,
would
go
on
my
knee
to
him
and
beg
him
to
avoid
woman
,
who
be
bad
than
poison
.
<EOS>
once
intrigue
,
and
your
whole
life
be
endanger
<EOS>
:
you
never
know
when
the
evil
may
fall
upon
you
;
and
the
woe
of
whole
family
,
and
the
ruin
of
innocent
people
perfectly
dear
to
you
,
may
be
cause
by
a
moment
of
your
folly
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
see
how
entirely
lose
the
unlucky
Monsieur
de
Magny
seem
to
be
,
in
spite
of
all
the
claim
I
have
against
him
,
I
urge
him
to
fly
.
<EOS>
He
have
room
in
the
palace
,
in
the
garret
over
the
Princess
's
quarter
(
the
building
be
a
huge
one
,
and
accommodate
almost
a
city
of
noble
retainer
of
the
family
)
;
but
the
infatuate
young
fool
would
not
budge
,
although
he
have
not
even
the
excuse
of
love
for
stay
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
she
squint
,
"
he
would
say
of
the
Princess
,
"
and
how
crooked
she
be
!
<EOS>
She
think
no
one
can
perceive
her
deformity
.
<EOS>
She
write
me
verse
out
of
Gresset
or
Crebillon
,
and
fancy
I
believe
them
to
be
original
.
<EOS>
bah
!
<EOS>
they
be
no
more
her
own
than
her
hair
be
!
<EOS>
"
It
be
in
this
way
that
the
wretched
lad
be
dance
over
the
ruin
that
be
yawn
under
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
believe
that
his
chief
pleasure
in
make
love
to
the
Princess
be
,
that
he
may
write
about
his
victory
to
his
friend
of
the
PETITES
maison
at
Paris
,
where
he
long
to
be
consider
as
a
wit
and
a
VAINQUEUR
de
dames
.
  
<EOS>
see
the
young
man
's
recklessness
,
and
the
danger
of
his
position
,
I
become
very
anxious
that
my
little
scheme
should
be
bring
to
a
satisfactory
end
,
and
press
him
warmly
on
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
My
solicitation
with
him
be
,
I
need
not
say
,
from
the
nature
of
the
connection
between
us
,
generally
pretty
successful
;
and
,
in
fact
,
the
poor
fellow
could
refuse
me
nothing
:
as
I
use
often
laughingly
to
say
to
him
,
very
little
to
his
liking
.
<EOS>
but
I
use
more
than
threat
,
or
the
legitimate
influence
I
have
over
him
.
<EOS>
I
use
delicacy
and
generosity
;
as
a
proof
of
which
,
I
may
mention
that
I
promise
to
give
back
to
the
Princess
the
family
emerald
,
which
I
mention
in
the
last
chapter
that
I
have
win
from
her
unprincipled
admirer
at
play
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
do
by
my
uncle
's
consent
,
and
be
one
of
the
usual
act
of
prudence
and
foresight
which
distinguish
that
clever
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
press
the
matter
now
,
Redmond
<EOS>
my
boy
,
"
he
would
urge
.
"
<EOS>
this
affair
between
her
Highness
and
Magny
must
end
ill
for
both
of
them
,
and
that
soon
;
and
where
will
be
your
chance
to
win
the
Countess
then
?
<EOS>
now
be
your
time
!
<EOS>
win
her
and
wear
her
before
the
month
be
over
,
and
we
will
give
up
the
punting
business
,
and
go
live
like
nobleman
at
our
castle
in
Swabia
.
<EOS>
get
rid
of
that
emerald
,
too
<EOS>
,
"
he
add
:
"
should
an
accident
happen
,
it
will
be
an
ugly
deposit
find
in
our
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
this
it
be
that
make
me
agree
to
forego
the
possession
of
the
trinket
;
which
,
I
must
confess
,
I
be
loth
to
part
with
.
<EOS>
It
be
lucky
for
us
both
that
I
do
:
as
you
shall
presently
hear
.
  
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
then
,
I
urge
Magny
:
I
myself
speak
strongly
to
the
Countess
of
Liliengarten
,
who
promise
formally
to
back
my
claim
with
his
highness
the
reign
Duke
;
and
Monsieur
de
Magny
be
instruct
to
induce
the
Princess
Olivia
to
make
a
similar
application
to
the
old
sovereign
in
my
behalf
.
<EOS>
It
be
do
.
<EOS>
the
two
lady
urge
the
Prince
;
his
Highness
(
at
a
supper
of
oyster
and
champagne
)
be
bring
to
consent
,
and
her
Highness
the
Hereditary
Princess
do
me
the
honour
of
notify
personally
to
the
Countess
Ida
that
it
be
the
Prince
's
will
that
she
should
marry
the
young
irish
nobleman
,
the
Chevalier
Redmond
de
Balibari
.
<EOS>
the
notification
be
make
in
my
presence
;
and
though
the
young
Countess
say
"
never
!
"
and
fall
down
in
a
swoon
at
her
lady
's
foot
,
I
be
,
you
may
be
sure
,
entirely
unconcerned
at
this
little
display
of
mawkish
sensibility
,
and
feel
,
indeed
,
now
that
my
prize
be
secure
.
  
<EOS>
that
evening
I
give
the
Chevalier
de
Magny
the
emerald
,
which
he
promise
to
restore
to
the
Princess
;
and
now
the
only
difficulty
in
my
way
lie
with
the
Hereditary
Prince
,
of
whom
his
father
,
his
wife
,
and
the
favourite
,
be
alike
afraid
.
<EOS>
He
may
not
be
dispose
to
allow
the
rich
heiress
in
his
duchy
to
be
carry
off
by
a
noble
,
though
not
a
wealthy
foreigner
.
<EOS>
Time
be
necessary
in
order
to
break
the
matter
to
Prince
Victor
.
<EOS>
the
Princess
must
find
him
at
some
moment
of
good
-
humour
.
<EOS>
He
have
day
of
infatuation
still
,
when
he
could
refuse
his
wife
nothing
;
and
our
plan
be
to
wait
for
one
of
these
,
or
for
any
other
chance
which
may
occur
.
  
<EOS>
but
it
be
destine
that
the
Princess
should
never
see
her
husband
at
her
foot
,
as
often
as
he
have
be
.
<EOS>
fate
be
prepare
a
terrible
end
to
her
folly
,
and
my
own
hope
.
<EOS>
in
spite
of
his
solemn
promise
to
me
,
Magny
never
restore
the
emerald
to
the
Princess
Olivia
.
  
<EOS>
He
have
hear
,
in
casual
intercourse
with
me
,
that
my
uncle
and
I
have
be
behold
to
Mr.
Moses
Lowe
,
the
banker
of
Heidelberg
,
who
have
give
us
a
good
price
for
our
valuable
;
and
the
infatuate
young
man
take
a
pretext
to
go
thither
,
and
offer
the
jewel
for
pawn
.
<EOS>
Moses
Lowe
recognise
the
emerald
at
once
,
give
Magny
the
sum
the
latter
demand
,
which
the
Chevalier
lose
presently
at
play
:
never
,
you
may
be
sure
,
acquaint
us
with
the
mean
by
which
he
have
make
himself
master
of
so
much
capital
.
<EOS>
We
,
for
our
part
,
suppose
that
he
have
be
supply
by
his
usual
banker
,
the
Princess
:
and
many
rouleaux
of
his
gold
piece
find
their
way
into
our
treasury
,
when
at
the
Court
gala
,
at
our
own
lodging
,
or
at
the
apartment
of
Madame
de
Liliengarten
<EOS>
(
who
on
these
occasion
do
us
the
honour
to
go
half
with
us
)
<EOS>
we
hold
our
bank
of
faro
.
  
<EOS>
thus
Magny
's
money
be
very
soon
go
.
<EOS>
but
though
the
Jew
hold
his
jewel
,
of
thrice
the
value
no
doubt
of
the
sum
he
have
lend
upon
it
,
that
be
not
all
the
profit
which
he
intend
to
have
from
his
unhappy
creditor
;
over
whom
he
begin
speedily
to
exercise
his
authority
.
<EOS>
His
hebrew
connection
at
x
 
,
money
-
broker
,
banker
,
horse
-
dealer
,
about
the
Court
there
,
must
have
tell
their
Heidelberg
brother
what
Magny
's
relation
with
the
Princess
be
;
and
the
rascal
determined
to
take
advantage
of
these
,
and
to
press
to
the
utmost
both
victim
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
and
I
be
,
meanwhile
,
swim
upon
the
high
tide
of
fortune
,
prosper
with
our
card
,
and
with
the
still
great
matrimonial
game
which
we
be
play
;
and
we
be
quite
unaware
of
the
mine
under
our
foot
.
  
<EOS>
before
a
month
be
pass
,
the
Jew
begin
to
pester
Magny
.
<EOS>
He
present
himself
at
x
 
,
and
ask
for
further
interest
-
hush
-
money
;
otherwise
he
must
sell
the
emerald
.
<EOS>
Magny
get
money
for
him
;
the
Princess
again
befriend
her
dastardly
lover
.
<EOS>
the
success
of
the
first
demand
only
render
the
second
more
exorbitant
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
much
money
be
extort
and
pay
on
this
unluckly
emerald
:
but
it
be
the
cause
of
the
ruin
of
us
all
.
  
<EOS>
one
night
we
be
keep
our
table
as
usual
at
the
Countess
of
Liliengarten
's
,
and
Magny
be
in
cash
somehow
,
keep
draw
out
rouleau
after
rouleau
,
and
play
with
his
common
ill
success
.
<EOS>
in
the
middle
of
the
play
a
note
be
bring
into
him
,
which
he
read
,
and
turn
very
pale
on
peruse
;
but
the
luck
be
against
him
,
and
look
up
rather
anxiously
at
the
clock
,
he
wait
for
a
few
more
turn
of
the
card
,
when
have
,
I
suppose
,
lose
his
last
rouleau
,
he
get
up
with
a
wild
oath
that
scare
some
of
the
polite
company
assemble
,
and
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
a
great
trampling
of
horse
be
hear
without
;
but
we
be
too
much
engage
with
our
business
to
heed
the
noise
,
and
continue
our
play
.
  
<EOS>
presently
some
one
come
into
the
play
-
room
and
say
to
the
Countess
,
"
here
be
a
strange
story
!
<EOS>
a
Jew
have
be
murder
in
the
Kaiserwald
.
<EOS>
Magny
be
arrest
when
he
go
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
all
the
party
break
up
on
hear
this
strange
news
,
and
we
shut
up
our
bank
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
Magny
have
be
sit
by
me
during
the
play
(
my
uncle
deal
and
I
pay
and
take
the
money
)
,
and
,
look
under
the
chair
,
there
be
a
crumple
paper
,
which
I
take
up
and
read
.
<EOS>
It
be
that
which
have
be
deliver
to
him
,
and
run
thus
:
 
"
if
you
have
do
it
,
take
the
orderly
's
horse
who
bring
this
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
good
of
my
stable
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
hundred
louis
in
each
holster
,
and
the
pistol
be
load
.
<EOS>
either
course
lie
open
to
you
if
you
know
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
I
shall
know
our
fate
 
whether
I
be
to
be
dishonour
and
survive
you
,
whether
you
be
guilty
and
a
coward
,
or
whether
you
be
still
worthy
of
the
name
of
      
"
M.
"
  
this
be
in
the
handwriting
of
the
old
General
de
Magny
;
and
my
uncle
and
I
,
as
we
walk
home
at
night
,
have
make
and
divide
with
the
Countess
Liliengarten
no
inconsiderable
profit
that
night
,
feel
our
triumph
greatly
dash
by
the
perusal
of
the
letter
.
"
<EOS>
have
Magny
,
"
we
ask
,
"
rob
the
Jew
,
or
have
his
intrigue
be
discover
?
<EOS>
"
in
either
case
,
my
claim
on
the
Countess
Ida
be
likely
to
meet
with
serious
drawback
:
and
I
begin
to
feel
that
my
"
great
card
"
be
play
and
perhaps
lose
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
it
be
lose
:
though
I
say
,
to
this
day
,
it
be
well
and
gallantly
play
.
<EOS>
after
supper
(
which
we
never
for
fear
of
consequence
take
during
play
)
<EOS>
I
become
so
agitated
in
my
mind
as
to
what
be
occur
that
I
determine
to
sally
out
about
midnight
into
the
town
,
and
inquire
what
be
the
real
motive
of
Magny
's
apprehension
.
<EOS>
a
sentry
be
at
the
door
,
and
signify
to
me
that
I
and
my
uncle
be
under
arrest
.
  
<EOS>
We
be
leave
in
our
quarter
for
six
week
,
so
closely
watch
that
escape
be
impossible
,
have
we
desire
it
;
but
,
as
innocent
man
,
we
have
nothing
to
fear
.
<EOS>
Our
course
of
life
be
open
to
all
,
and
we
desire
and
court
inquiry
.
<EOS>
great
and
tragical
event
happen
during
those
six
week
;
of
which
,
though
we
hear
the
outline
,
as
all
Europe
do
,
when
we
be
release
from
our
captivity
,
we
be
yet
far
from
understand
all
the
particular
,
which
be
not
much
know
to
me
for
many
year
after

<EOS>
here
they
be
,
as
they
be
tell
me
by
the
lady
,
who
of
all
the
world
perhaps
be
most
likely
to
know
them
.
<EOS>

the
narrative

good

the
content

More
than
twenty
year
after
the
event
describe
in
the
past
chapter
,
I
be
walk
with
my
Lady
Lyndon
in
the
Rotunda
at
Ranelagh
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
year
1790
;
the
emigration
from
France
have
already
commence
,
the
old
count
and
marquise
be
throng
to
our
shore
:
not
starve
and
miserable
,
as
one
see
them
a
few
year
afterwards
,
but
unmoleste
as
yet
,
and
bring
with
them
some
token
of
their
national
splendour

<EOS>
I
be
walk
with
Lady

who
,
proverbially
jealous
and
always
anxious
to
annoy
me
,
spy
out
a
foreign
lady
who
be
evidently
remark
me
,
and
of
course
ask
who
be
the
hideous
fat
Dutchwoman
who
be
leer
at
me
so
?
<EOS>
I
know
her
not
in

I
feel
I
have
see
the
lady
's
face
somewhere

after

she
give
me
briefly
the

narrative
of

event

I
may
well
entitle
the
"
Princess

Tragedy

You
remember
Monsieur
de
Geldern
,
the
Police
Minister
.
<EOS>
He
be
of
dutch
extraction
,
and
,
what
be
more
,
of
a
family
of
Dutch
Jews
.
<EOS>
although
everybody
be
aware
of
this
blot
in
his
scutcheon
,
he
be
mortally
angry
if
ever
his
origin
be
suspect
;
and
make
up
for
his
father
'
error
by
outrageous
profession
of
religion
,
and
the
most
austere
practice
of
devotion
.
<EOS>
He
visit
church
every
morning
,
confess
once
a
week
,
and
hate
Jews
and
Protestants
as
much
as
an
inquisitor
could
do
.
<EOS>
He
never
lose
an
opportunity
of
prove
his
sincerity
,
by
persecute
one
or
the
other
whenever
occasion
fall
in
his
way
.
  
<EOS>

He
hate
the
Princess
mortally
;
for
her
Highness
in
some
whim
have
insult
him
with
his
origin
,
cause
pork
to
be
remove
from
before
him
at
table
,
or
injure
him
in
some
such
silly
way
;
and
he
have
a
violent
animosity
to
the
old
Baron
de
Magny
,
both
in
his
capacity
of
Protestant
,
and
because
the
latter
in
some
haughty
mood
have
publicly
turn
his
back
upon
him
as
a
sharp
and
a
spy
.
<EOS>
perpetual
quarrel
be
take
place
between
them
in
council
;
where
it
be
only
the
presence
of
his
august
master
that
restrain
the
Baron
from
publicly
and
frequently
express
the
contempt
which
he
feel
for
the
officer
of
police

<EOS>

thus
Geldern
have
hatred
as
one
reason
for
ruin
the
Princess
,
and
it
be
my
belief
he
have
a
strong
motive
still
 
interest
.

You

with

have
no

be
innocent
;
his
birth

such
a
crime
impossible

strong

he

know

have
be

strong

the
Prince
,
when
he
come
away
from
the
conversation
with

three
day
after

make
a
confession
that
he

engage
in
an
attempt

rob
the

that
he
have
make
away
with
himself

carry
his

the
draught
which
be
to
carry
him
out

represent
to

wretched
youth
that
his
fate
be
inevitable
;
that
it
would
be
public
and
disgraceful
unless
he
choose
to
anticipate
the
punishment
,

so
leave
him
.

it
be
not

not
until

have
use
every
mean
of
escape

find
mean
to
communicate
with

from

her
Highness

who
be
not
in
open
disgrace
yet
(
for
the

out
of
regard
to

in
charge

only
robbery

make
the
most
desperate
effort
to
relieve
him

to
bribe
the
gaoler
to
effect
his
escape

She
be
so
wild
that
she
lose
all
patience

prudence
in
the
conduct
of
any
scheme
she
may
have
have
for
Magny
's
liberation
;
for
her
husband
be
inexorable
,

cause
the
Chevalier
's
prison
to
be
too
strictly
guard
for
escape
to
be
possible

She
offer
the
state
jewel
in

to
the

banker

my

,
with
his
age

disease

be
quite
unfit

My

<EOS>
My
profession
be
play

in
which
I
be
then
unrivalled
.
<EOS>
no
man
could
play
with
me
through
Europe

on

and
my
income
be
just
as
certain
(
during
health

as

there

<EOS>
in
evoke
the
recollection
of
these
kind
and
fair
creature
I
have
nothing
but
pleasure
.
<EOS>
I
would
I
could
say
as
much
of
the
memory
of
another
lady
,
who
will
henceforth
play
a
considerable
part
in
the
drama
of
my
life
,
 
<EOS>
I
mean
the
Countess
of
Lyndon
;
whose
fatal
acquaintance
I
make
at
Spa
,
very
soon
after
the
event

<EOS>
Honoria
,
Countess
of
Lyndon
,
Viscountess
Bullingdon
in
England
,
Baroness
Castle
Lyndon
of
the
kingdom
of
Ireland
,
be
so
well
known
to
the
great
world
in
her
day
,
that
I
have
little
need
to
enter
into
her
family
history
;
which
be
to
be
have
in
any
peerage
that
the
reader
may
lay
his
hand
on
.
<EOS>
She
be
,
as
I
need
not
say
,
a
countess
,
viscountess
,
and
baroness
in
her
own
right
.
<EOS>
Her
estate
in
Devon
and
Cornwall
be
among
the
most
extensive
in
those
part
;
her
irish
possession
not
less
magnificent
;
and
they
have
be
allude
to
,
in
a
very
early
part
of
these
Memoirs
,
as
lie
near
to
my
own
paternal
property
in
the
kingdom
of
Ireland
:
<EOS>
indeed
,
unjust
confiscation
in
the
time
of
Elizabeth
and
her
father
go
to
diminish
my
acre
,
while
they
add
to
the
already
vast
possession
of
the
Lyndon
family
.
  
<EOS>
the
Countess
,
when
I
first
see
her
at
the
assembly
at
Spa
,
be
the
wife
of
her
cousin
,
the
right
honourable
Sir
Charles
Reginald
Lyndon
,
Knight
of
the
Bath
,
and
Minister
to
George
II
.
<EOS>
and
George
III
.
<EOS>
at
several
of
the
small
Courts
of
Europe
.
<EOS>
Sir
Charles
Lyndon
be
celebrate
as
a
wit
and
bon
vivant
:
he
could
write
love
-
verse
against
Hanbury
Williams
,
and
make
joke
with
George
Selwyn
;
he
be
a
man
of
vertu
like
Harry
Walpole
,
with
whom
and
Mr.
Grey
he
have
make
a
part
of
the
grand
tour
;
and
be
cite
,
in
a
word
,
as
one
of
the
most
elegant
and
accomplished
man
of
his
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
make
this
gentleman
's
acquaintance
as
usual
at
the
play
-
table
,
of
which
he
be
a
constant
frequenter
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
one
could
not
but
admire
the
spirit
and
gallantry
with
which
he
pursue
his
favourite
pastime
;
for
,
though
wear
out
by
gout
and
a
myriad
of
disease
,
a
cripple
wheel
about
in
a
chair
,
and
suffer
pang
of
agony
,
yet
you
would
see
him
every
morning
and
every
evening
at
his
post
behind
the
delightful
green
cloth
:
and
if
,
as
it
would
often
happen
,
his
own
hand
be
too
feeble
or
inflamed
to
hold
the
box
,
he
would
call
the
main
,
nevertheless
,
and
have
his
valet
or
a
friend
to
throw
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
like
this
courageous
spirit
in
a
man
;
the
great
success
in
life
have
be
win
by
such
indomitable
perseverance
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
by
this
time
one
of
the
best
-
know
character
in
Europe
;
and
the
fame
of
my
exploit
,
my
duel
,
my
courage
at
play
,
would
bring
crowd
around
me
in
any
public
society
where
I
appear
.
<EOS>
I
could
show
ream
of
scented
paper
,
to
prove
that
this
eagerness
to
make
my
acquaintance
be
not
confine
to
the
gentleman
only
;
but
that
I
hate
boast
,
and
only
talk
of
myself
in
so
far
as
it
be
necessary
to
relate
myself
's
adventure
:
the
most
singular
of
any
man
's
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
well
,
Sir
Charles
Lyndon
's
first
acquaintance
with
me
originate
in
the
right
honourable
knight
's
win
700
piece
of
me
at
picquet
(
for
which
he
be
almost
my
match
)
;
and
I
lose
them
with
much
good
-
humour
,
and
pay
them
:
and
pay
them
,
you
may
be
sure
,
punctually
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
will
say
this
for
myself
,
that
lose
money
at
play
never
in
the
least
put
me
out
of
good
-
humour
with
the
winner
,
and
that
wherever
I
find
a
superior
,
I
be
always
ready
to
acknowledge
and
hail
him
.
  
<EOS>
Lyndon
be
very
proud
of
win
from
so
celebrate
a
person
,
and
we
contract
a
kind
of
intimacy
;
which
,
however
,
do
not
for
a
while
go
beyond
pump
-
room
attention
,
and
conversation
over
the
supper
-
table
at
play
:
but
which
gradually
increase
,
until
I
be
admit
into
his
more
private
friendship
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
very
free
-
spoken
man
<EOS>
(
the
gentry
of
those
day
be
much
prouder
than
at
present
)
,
and
use
to
say
to
me
in
his
haughty
easy
way
,
"
hang
it
,
Mr.
Barry
,
you
have
no
more
manner
than
a
barber
,
and
I
think
my
black
footman
have
be
better
educate
than
you
;
but
you
be
a
young
fellow
of
originality
and
pluck
,
and
I
like
you
,
sir

because
you
seem
determined
to
go
to
the
deuce
by
a
way
of
your
own

I
would
thank
him
laughingly
for
this
compliment
,
and
say
,
that
as
he
be
bind
to
the
next
world
much
sooner
than
I

I
would
be
oblige
to
him
to
get
comfortable
quarter

there
for

<EOS>
He
use
also
to
be
immensely
amuse
with
my
story
about
the
splendour
of
my
family
and
the
magnificence
of
Castle
Brady

he
would
never
tire
of

at
those

"
Stick

the

he
would
say
,
when
I
tell
him
of
my
misfortune
in
the
conjugal
line
,
and
how
near
I
have
be

the
great
fortune
in
Germany

anything

artless

of
queer

I

I

<EOS>
She

half

<EOS>
in
her
own
she
would
travel
with
her
companion
(
some
shabby
lady
of
quality
)
,
her
bird
,
and
poodle
,
and
the
favourite
savant
for
the

<EOS>
in
another

be
her
female

her
waiting

woman

who
,
in
spite
of
their
care

never
could
make
their

look

well

<EOS>
Sir
Charles
Lyndon
have
his
own
chariot
,
and
the
domestic
of
the
establishment
would
follow
in
other

<EOS>
also
must
be
mention
the
carriage
in
which
ride
her
Ladyship

chaplain
,
Mr.
Runt
,
who
act
in
capacity
of
governor
to
her

the
little
Viscount
Bullingdon

a
melancholy
deserted
little
boy

about
whom
his
father
be
more
than
indifferent
,
and
whom
his
mother
never
see
,
except
for
two
minute
at
her
levee

when
she
would
put
to
him
a
few
question
of
history
or
latin
grammar
;
after
which
he
be
consign
to
his
own
amusement
,
or
the
care
of
his

,
for
the
rest
of
the

<EOS>
the
notion
of
such
a
Minerva
as
this
,
whom
I
see
in
the
public
place
now
and
then
,
surround
by
swarm
of
needy
abbe
and
schoolmaster
,
who
flatter
her
,
frighten
me
for
some
time
,
and
I
have
not
the
least
desire
to
make
her
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
desire
to
be
one
of
the
beggarly
adorer
in
the
great
lady
's
train
,
 
fellow
,
half
friend
,
half
lacquey
,
who
make
verse
,
and
write
letter

and
run
errand
,
content
to
be
pay
by
a
seat
in

<EOS>
"
do
not

afraid
,
"
Sir
Charles
Lyndon
would
say
,
whose
great
subject
of
conversation
and
abuse
be
his
lady
:
"
my
Lindonira
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
you

<EOS>
She
like
the
Tuscan
brogue

not
that
of
Kerry

<EOS>
She
say
you
smell
too
much
of
the
stable
to
be
admit
to
lady
'
society
;
and
last
Sunday
fortnight
,
when
she
do
me
the
honour
to
speak
to
me
last
,
say
,
"
I
wonder
,
Sir
Charles
Lyndon
,
a
gentleman
who
have
be
the
King

ambassador
can
demean
himself
by
gamble
and
booze
with
low
irish
blackleg

"
<EOS>
do
not
fly
in
a
fury
!
<EOS>
I
be
a
cripple
,
and
it
be
Lindonira
say
it
,
not
I.
"
  
<EOS>
this
pique
me
,
and
I
resolve
to
become
acquainted
with
Lady
Lyndon
;
if
it
be
but
to
show
her
ladyship
that
the
descendant
of
those
Barrys
,
whose
property
she
unjustly
hold
,
be
not
an
unworthy
companion
for
any
lady
,
be
she
ever
so
high
.
<EOS>
besides
,
my
friend
the
knight
be
die
:
his
widow
would
be
the
rich
prize
in
the
three
kingdom
.
<EOS>
why
should
I
not
win
her
,
and
,
with
her
,
the
mean
of
make
in
the
world
that
figure
which
my
genius
and
inclination
desire
?
<EOS>
I
feel
I
be
equal
in
blood
and
breeding
to
any
Lyndon
in
Christendom
,
and
determine
to
bend
this
haughty
lady
.
<EOS>
when
I
determine
,
I
look
upon
the
thing
as
do
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
and
I
talk
the
matter
over
,
and
speedily
settle
upon
a
method
for
make
our
approach
upon
this
stately
lady
of
Castle
Lyndon
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Runt
,
young
Lord
Bullingdon
's
governor
,
be
fond
of
pleasure
,
of
a
glass
of
Rhenish
in
the
garden
-
house
in
the
summer
evening
,
and
of
a
sly
throw
of
the
dice
when
the
occasion
offer
;
and
I
take
care
to
make
friend
with
this
person
,
who
,
be
a
college
tutor
and
an
Englishman
,
be
ready
to
go
on
his
knee
to
any
one
who
resemble
a
man
of
fashion

<EOS>
see
me
with
my
retinue

Europe
as

the
course
,
or
at
the
Spas
,
Runt
be
dazzle
by
my
advance
,
and
be
mine
by
a
beckoning
of
the
finger
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
the
poor
wretch
's
astonishment
when
I
ask
him
to
dine
,
with
two
count
,
off
gold
plate
,
at
the
little
room
in
the
casino
:
he
be
make
happy
by
be
allow
to
win
a
few
piece
of
us
,
become
exceedingly
tipsy
,
sing
Cambridge
song
,
and
recreate
the
company
by
tell
us
,
in
his
horrid
Yorkshire
French
,
story
about
the
gyps
,
and
all
the
lord
that
have
ever
be
in
his
college
.
<EOS>
I
encourage
him
to
come
and
see
me
oftener
,
and
bring
with
him
his
little
viscount
;
for
whom
,
though
the
boy
always
detest
me
,
I
take
care
to
have
a
good
stock
of
sweetmeat
,
toy
,
and
picture
-
book
when
he
come
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
begin
to
enter
into
a
controversy
with
Mr.
Runt
,
and
confide
to
him
some
doubt
which
I
have
,
and
a
very
very
earnest
lean
towards
the
Church
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
I
make
a
certain
abbe
whom
I
know
write
me
letter
upon
transubstantiation
,
&
c.
,
which
the
honest
tutor
be
rather
puzzle
to
answer
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
they
would
be
communicate
to
his
lady
,
as
they
be
;
for
,
ask
leave
to
attend
the
English
service
which
be
celebrate
in
her
apartment
,
and
frequent
by
the
good
English
then
at
the
Spa
,
on
the
second
Sunday
she
condescend
to
look
at
me
;
on
the
third
she
be
pleased
to
reply
to
my
profound
bow
by
a
curtsey
;
the
next
day
I
follow
up
the
acquaintance
by
another
obeisance
in
the
public
walk
;
and
,
to
make
a
long
story
short
,
her
Ladyship
and
I
be
in
full
correspondence
on
transubstantiation
before
six
week
be
over
.
<EOS>
My
Lady
come
to
the
aid
of
her
chaplain
;
and
then
I
begin
to
see
the
prodigious
weight
of
his
argument
:
as
be
to
be
expect
.
<EOS>
the
progress
of
this
harmless
little
intrigue
nee
not
be
detail
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
doubt
every
one
of
my
reader
have
practise
similar
stratagem
when
a
fair
lady
be
in
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
the
astonishment
of
Sir
Charles
Lyndon
when
,
on
one
summer
evening
,
as
he
be
issue
out
to
the
play
-
table
in
his
sedan
-
chair
,
accord
to
his
will
not
,
her
Ladyship
's
barouche
and
four
,
with
her
outrider
in
the
tawny
livery
of
the
Lyndon
family
,
come
drive
into
the
courtyard
of
the
house
which
they
inhabit
;
and
in
that
carriage
,
by
her
Ladyship
's
side
,
sit
no
other
than
the
"
vulgar
irish
adventurer
,
"
as
she
be
pleased
to
call
him
:
I
mean
Redmond
Barry
,
Esquire
.
<EOS>
He
make
the
most
courtly
of
his
bow
,
and
grin
and
wave
his
hat
in
as
graceful
a
manner
as
the
gout
permit
;
and
her
Ladyship
and
I
reply
to
the
salutation
with
the
utmost
politeness
and
elegance
on
our
part
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
go
to
the
play
-
table
for
some
time
afterwards
for
Lady
Lyndon
<EOS>
and
I
have
an
argument
on
transubstantiation
,
which
last
for
three
hour
;
in
which
she
be
,
as
usual
,
victorious
,
and
,
in
which
her
companion
,
the
Honourable
Miss
Flint
Skinner
,
fall
asleep
;
but
when
,
at
last
,
I
join
Sir
Charles
at
the
casino
,
he
receive
me
with
a
yell
of
laughter
,
as
his
will
not
be
,
and
introduce
me
to
all
the
company
as
Lady
Lyndon
's
interesting
young
convert
.
<EOS>
this
be
his
way
.
<EOS>
He
laugh
and
sneer
at
everything
.
<EOS>
He
laugh
when
he
be
in
a
paroxysm
of
pain
;
he
laugh
when
he
win
money
,
or
when
he
lose
it
:
<EOS>
his
laugh
be
not
jovial
or
agreeable
,
but
rather
painful
and
sardonic
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
say
he
to
Punter
,
Colonel
Loder
,
Count
du
Carreau
,
and
several
jovial
fellow
with
whom
he
use
to
discuss
a
flask
of
champagne
and
a
rhenish
trout
or
two
after
play
,
"
see
this
amiable
youth
!
<EOS>
He
have
be
trouble
by
religious
scruple

and
have
fly
for
refuge
to
my
chaplain
,
Mr.
Runt

who
have
ask
for
advice
from
my
wife
,
Lady

and
,
between

both

friend
in

<EOS>
"
He

the

<EOS>
"
the

I

"

"
<EOS>
at
which
reply
Sir
Charles
be
not
very
well
pleased
,
and
go
on
with
increase
rancour
.
<EOS>
He
be
always
free
-
spoken
in
his
cup
;
and
,
to
say
the
truth
,
he
be
in
his
cup
many
more
time
in
a
week
than
his
doctor
allow
.
  
<EOS>
"
be
it
not
a
pleasure
,
gentleman
,
"
say
he
,
"
for
me
,
as
I
be
draw
near
the
goal
,
to
find
my
home
such
a
happy
one
;
my
wife
so
fond
of
me
,
that
she
be
even
now
think
of
appoint
a
successor
?
<EOS>
(
I
do
not
mean
you
precisely
,
Mr.
Barry
;
you
be
only
take
your
chance
with
a
score
of
other
whom
I
could
mention
.
)
<EOS>
be
not
it
a
comfort
to
see
her
,
like
a
prudent
housewife
,
get
everything
ready
for
her
husband
's
departure
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
be
not

of
leave
us
soon
,
knight
?
"
say
I
,
with
perfect
sincerity
;
for
I
like
him
,
as
a
most
amusing
companion

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
not
so
soon

my
dear

as
you
may
fancy
,
perhaps
,

continue
he

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
why
,
man
,
I
have
be
give
over
any
time
these
four
year
;
and
there
be
always
a
candidate
or
two

to
apply
for
the
situation
.
<EOS>
who
know
how
long
I
may
keep
you
wait
?
"
and
he
do
keep
me
wait
some
little
time
longer
than
at
that
period
there
be
any
reason
to
suspect
.
  
<EOS>
as
I
declare
myself
pretty
openly
,
accord
to
my
usual
way
,
and
author
be
accustomed
to
describe
the
person
of
the
lady
with
whom
their
hero
fall
in
love
;
in
compliance
with
this
fashion
,
I
perhaps
should
say
a
word
or
two
respect
the
charm
of
my
Lady
Lyndon
.
<EOS>
but
though
I
celebrate
them
in
many
copy
of
verse
,
of
my
own
and
other
person
'
writing
;
and
though
I
fill
ream
of
paper
in
the
passionate
style
of
those
day
with
compliment
to
every
one
of
her
beauty
and
smile
,
in
which
I
compare
her
to
every
flower
,
goddess
,
or
famous
heroine
ever
hear
of
,
 
truth
compel
me
to
say
that
there
be
nothing
divine
about
her
at
all
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
well
;
but
no
more
.
<EOS>
Her
shape
be
fine
,
her
hair
dark
,
her
eye
good
,
and
exceedingly
active
;
she
love
singe
,
but
perform
it
as
so
great
a
lady
should
,
very
much
out
of
tune
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
smattering
of
half
-
a
-
dozen
modern
language
,
and
,
as
I
have
say
before
,
of
many
more
science
than
I
even
know
the
name
of
.
<EOS>
She
pique
herself
on
know
Greek
and
Latin
;
but
the
truth
be
,
that
Mr.
Runt
,
use
to
supply
her
with
the
quotation
which
she
introduce
into
her
voluminous
correspondence
.
<EOS>
She
have
as
much
love
of
admiration
,
as
strong
,
uneasy
a
vanity
,
and
<EOS>
as
little
heart
,
as
any
woman
I
ever
know
.
<EOS>
otherwise
,
when
her
son
,
Lord
Bullingdon
,
on
account
of
his
difference
with
me
,
run
 
but
that
matter
shall
be
tell
in
its
proper
time
.
<EOS>
finally
,
my
Lady
Lyndon
be
about
a
year
old
than
myself
;
though
,
of
course
,
she
would
take
her
Bible
oath
that
she
be
three
year
young
.
  
<EOS>
few
man
be
so
honest
as
I
be
;
for
few
will
own
to
their
real
motive
,
and
I
do
not
care
a
button
about
confess
mine
.
<EOS>
what
Sir
Charles
Lyndon
say
be
perfectly
true
.
<EOS>
I
make
the
acquaintance
of
Lady
Lyndon
with
ulterior
view
.
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
say
I
to
him
,
when
,
after
the
scene
describe
and
the
joke
he
make
upon
me
<EOS>
,
we
meet
alone
,
"
let
those
laugh
that
win
.
<EOS>
You
be
very
pleasant
upon
me
a
few
night
since
,
and
on
my
intention
regard
your
lady
.
<EOS>
well
,
if
they
are
what
you
think
they
be
,
 
if
I
do
wish
to
step
into
your
shoe
,
what
then
?
<EOS>
I
have
no
other
intention
than
you
have
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
swear
to
muster
just
as
much
regard
for
my
Lady
Lyndon
as
you
ever
show
her
;
and
if
I
win
her
and
wear
her
when
you
be
dead
and
go
,
corbleu
,
knight
,
do
you
think
it
will
be
the
fear
of
your
ghost
<EOS>
will
deter
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lyndon
laugh
as
usual
;
but
somewhat
disconcertedly
:
indeed
I
have
clearly
the
good
of
him
in
the
argument
,
and
have
just
as
much
right
to
hunt
my
fortune
as
he
have
.
  
<EOS>
but
one
day
he
say
,
"
if
you
marry
such
a
woman
as
my
Lady
Lyndon
,
mark
my
word
,
you
will
regret
it
.
<EOS>
You
will
pine
after
the
liberty
you
once
enjoy

"
the
thing
that
I
regret
most
in

perhaps
it
be
because
I

laugh
at

well

why
not
a

<EOS>
My
good

I

as
most
gentleman

with
my
tutor

Helena

a
bounce
girl

of

old
than
myself

(
this
make
me
remember
my
own
little
love
-
passage
with
Nora
Brady
in
the
day
of
my
early
life
)
,
"
and
do
you
know
,
sir
,
I
heartily
regret
<EOS>
I
do
not
marry
her
?
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
like
have
a
virtuous
drudge
at
home
,
sir
;
depend
upon
that
.
<EOS>
It
give
a
z
to
one
's
enjoyment
in
the
world
,
take
my
word
for
it
.
<EOS>
no
man
of
sense
need
restrict
himself
,
or
deny
himself
a
single
amusement
for
his
wife
's
sake
:
on
the
contrary
,
if
he
select
the
animal
properly
,
he
will
choose
such
a
one
as
shall
be
no
bar
to
his
pleasure
,
but
a
comfort
in
his
hour
of
annoyance
.
<EOS>
for
instance
,
I
have
get
the
gout
:
who
tend
me
?
<EOS>
a
hire
valet
,
who
rob
me
whenever
he
have
the
power
.
<EOS>
My
wife
never
come
near
me
.
<EOS>
what
friend
have
I
?
<EOS>
none
in
the
wide
world
.
<EOS>
man
of
the
world
,
as
you
and
I
be
,
do
not
make
friend
;
and
we
be
fool
for
our
pain
.
<EOS>
get
a
friend
,
sir
,
and
that
friend
a
woman
 
a
good
household
drudge
,
who
love
you
.
<EOS>
that
be
the
most
precious
sort
of
friendship
;
for
the
expense
of
it
be
all
on
the
woman
's
side
.
<EOS>
the
man
nee
not
contribute
anything
.
<EOS>
if
he
be
a
rogue
,
she
will
vow
<EOS>
he
be
an
angel
;
if
he
be
a
brute
,
she
will
like
him
<EOS>
all
the
well
for
his
ill
-
treatment
of
her
.
<EOS>
They
like
it
,
sir
,
these
woman
.
<EOS>
They
be
bear
to
be
our
great
comfort
and
convenience
;
our
 
our
moral
bootjack

as
it
be
;
and
to
man
in
your

believe
me
such

would
be
invaluable

<EOS>
I
be
only
speak
for
your
bodily

mental
comfort
's

,
mind

<EOS>
why
do
not
I
marry
poor
Helena
Flower
,
the
curate
's
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
these
speech
the
remark
of
a
weakly
disappointed
man
;
although
since
,
perhaps
,
I
have
have
reason
to
find
the
truth
of
Sir
Charles
Lyndon
's
statement
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
in
my
opinion
,
that
we
often
buy
money
very
much
too
dear
.
<EOS>
to
purchase
a
few
thousand
a
year
at
the
expense
of
an
odious
wife
,
be
very
bad
economy
for
a
young
fellow
of
any
talent
and
spirit
;
and
there
have
be
moment
of
my
life
when
,
in
the
midst
of
my
great
splendour
and
opulence
,
with
half
-
a
-
dozen
lord
at
my
levee
,
with
the
fine
horse
in
my
stable
,
the
grand
house
over
my
head
,
with
unlimited
credit
at
my
banker
's
,
and
 
Lady
Lyndon
to
boot
,
I
have
wish
myself
back
a
private
of
Bulow
's
,
or
anything
,
so
as
to
get
rid
of
her
.
<EOS>
to
return
,
however
,
to
the
story
.
<EOS>
Sir
Charles
,
with
his
complication
of
ill
,
be
die
before
us
by
inch
!
<EOS>
and
I
have
no
doubt
it
could
not
have
be
very
pleasant
to
him
to
see
a
young
handsome
fellow
pay
court
to
his
widow
before
his
own
face
as
it
be
.
<EOS>
after
I
once
get
into
the
house
on
the
transubstantiation
dispute
,
I
find
a
dozen
more
occasion
to
improve
my
intimacy
,
and
be
scarcely
ever
out
of
her
Ladyship
's
door
.
<EOS>
the
world
talk
and
bluster
;
but
what
care
I
?
<EOS>
the
man
cry
fie
upon
the
shameless
irish
adventurer
;
but
I
have
tell
my
way
of
silence
such
envious
people
:
and
my
sword
have
by
this
time
get
such
a
reputation
through
Europe
,
that
few
people
care
to
encounter
it
.
<EOS>
if
I
can
once
get
my
hold
of
a
place
,
I
keep
it
.
<EOS>
many
be
the
house
I
have
be
to
where
I
have
see
the
man
avoid
me
.
"
<EOS>
Faugh
!
<EOS>
the
low
Irishman
,
"
they
would
say
.
<EOS>
"
bah
!
<EOS>
the
coarse
adventurer
!
"
<EOS>
"
out
on
the
insufferable
blackleg
and
puppy
!
"
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
this
hatred
have
be
of
no
inconsiderable
service
to
me
in
the
world
;
for
when
I
fasten
on
a
man
,
nothing
can
induce
me
to
release
my
hold
:
and
I
be
leave
to
myself
,
which
be
all
the
well
.
<EOS>
as
I
tell
Lady
Lyndon
in
those
day
,
with
perfect
sincerity
,
"
Calista
"
(
I
use
to
call
her
Calista
in
my
correspondence
)
 
<EOS>
"
Calista
,
I
swear
to
thee
,
by
the
spotlessness
of
thy
own
soul
,
by
the
brilliancy
of
thy
immitigable
eye
,
by
everything
pure
and
chaste
in
heaven
and
in
thy
own
heart
,
that
I
will
never
cease
from
follow
thee
!
<EOS>
Scorn
I
can
bear
,
and
have
bear
at
thy
hand
.
<EOS>
indifference
I
can
surmount
;
'
tis
a
rock
which
my
energy
will
climb
over
,
a
magnet
which
attract
the
dauntless
iron
of
my
soul
!
"
<EOS>
and
it
be
true
,
I
would
not
have
leave
her
 
no
,
though
they
have
kick
me
downstairs
every
day
I
present
myself
at
her
door
.
  
<EOS>
that
be
my
way
of
fascinating
woman
.
<EOS>
let
the
man
who
have
to
make
his
fortune
in
life
remember
this
maxim
.
<EOS>
ATTACKING
be
his
only
secret
.
<EOS>
dare
,
and
the
world
always
yield
:
or
,
if
it
beat
you
sometimes
,
dare
again
,
and
it
will
succumb
.
<EOS>
in
those
day
my
spirit
be
so
great
,
that
if
I
have
set
my
heart
upon
marry
a
princess
of
the
blood
,
I
would
have
have
her
!
  
<EOS>
I
tell
Calista
my
story
,
and
alter
very
very
little
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
My
object
be
to
frighten
her
:
to
show
her
that
what
I
want
,
that
I
dare
;
that
what
I
dare
,
that
I
win
;
and
there
be
strike
passage
enough
in
my
history
to
convince
her
of
my
iron
will
and
indomitable
courage
.
"
<EOS>
never
hope
to
escape
me
,
madam
,
"
<EOS>
I
would
say
:
"
offer
to
marry
another
man
,
and
he
die
upon
this
sword
,
which
never
yet
meet
its
master
.
<EOS>
fly
from
me
,
and
I
will
follow
you
,
though
it
be
to
the
gate
of
Hades
.
<EOS>
"
I
promise
you
this
be
very
different
language
to
that
she
have
be
in
the
habit
of
hear
from
her
Jemmy
-
Jessamy
adorer
.
<EOS>
You
should
have
see
how
I
scare
the
fellow
from
her
.
  
<EOS>
when
I
say
in
this
energetic
way
that
I
would
follow
Lady
Lyndon
across
the
Styx
if
necessary
,
of
course
I
mean
that
I
would
do
so
,
provide
nothing
more
suitable
present
itself
in
the
interim
.
<EOS>
if
Lyndon
would
not
die
,
where
be
the
use
of
my
pursuing
the
Countess
?
<EOS>
and
somehow
,
towards
the
end
of
the
Spa
season
,
very
much
to
my
mortification
<EOS>
I
do
confess
,
the
knight
make
another
rally
:
it
seem
as
if
nothing
would
kill
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
sorry
for
you
,
Captain
Barry
,
"
he
would
say
,
laugh
as
usual
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
grieve
to
keep
you
,
or
any
gentleman
,
wait
.
<EOS>
have
you
not
better
arrange
with
my
doctor
,
or
get
the
cook
to
flavour
my
omelette
with
arsenic
?
<EOS>
what
be
the
odd
,
gentleman
,
"
he
would
add
,
"
that
I
do
not
live
to
see
Captain
Barry
hang
yet
?
"
  
<EOS>
in
fact
,
the
doctor
tinker
him
up
for
a
year
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
my
usual
luck
,
"
I
could
not
help
say
to
my
uncle
,
who
be
my
confidential
and
most
excellent
adviser
in
all
matter
of
the
heart
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
be
waste
the
treasure
of
my
affection
upon
that
flirt
of
a
countess
,
and
here
be
her
husband
restore
to
health
and
likely
to
live
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
how
many
year
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
,
as
if
to
add
to
my
mortification
,
there
come
just
at
this
period
to
Spa
an
english
tallow
-
chandler
's
heiress
,
with
a
plum
to
her
fortune
;
and
Madame
Cornu
,
the
widow
of
a
Norman
cattle
-
dealer
and
farmer
-
general
,
with
a
dropsy
and
two
hundred
thousand
livre
a

<EOS>
"
what
be
the
use
of
my
follow
the
Lyndons
to
England

"
say
I
,
"
if
the
knight
will
not
die
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
follow
them
,
my
dear
simple
child

reply
my
uncle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
stop
here
and
pay
court
to
the
new
arrival
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
yes
,
and
lose
Calista
for
ever
,
and
the
great
estate
in
all
England

<EOS>
"
  
"
pooh

<EOS>
youth

you
easily

<EOS>

up
a

with
Lady

You
know
there
be
nothing
she
like
so
much

<EOS>
there
be
the
irish
abbe

will
write
you
the
most
charming
letter
for
a
crown
apiece

<EOS>
let
her
go
;
write
to
her
,
and
meanwhile
look
out
for
anything
else
which
may
turn
up
.
<EOS>
who
know
?
<EOS>
you
may
marry
the
Norman
widow
,
bury
her
,
take
her
money
,
and
be
ready
for
the
Countess
against
the
knight
's
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
and
so
,
with
vow
of
the
most
profound
respectful
attachment
,
and
have
give
twenty
louis
to
Lady
Lyndon
's
waiting
-
woman
for
a
lock
of
her
hair
(
of
which
fact
,
of
course
,
the
woman
inform
her
mistress
)
,
I
take
leave
of
the
Countess
,
when
it
become
necessary
for
her
return
to
her
estate
in
England
;
swear
I
would
follow
her
as
soon
as
an
affair
of
honour
I
have
on
my
hand
could
be
bring
to
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
pass
over
the
event
of
the
year
that
ensue
before
I
again
see
her
.
<EOS>
She
write
to
me
accord
to
promise
;
with
much
regularity
at
first
,
with
somewhat
less
frequency
afterwards
.
<EOS>
My
affair
,
meanwhile
,
at
the
play
-
table
go
on
not
unprosperously
,
and
I
be
just
on
the
point
of
marry
the
widow
Cornu
(
we
be
at
Brussels
by
this
time
,
and
the
poor
soul
be
madly
in
love
with
me
,
)
when
the
London
Gazette
be
put
into
my
hand
,
and
I
read
the
follow
announcement
:
    
<EOS>
"
die
at
Castle
-
Lyndon

in
the
kingdom
of
Ireland
,
the
right
honourable
Sir
Charles
Lyndon
,
Knight
of
the
Bath
,
member
of
Parliament
for
Lyndon
in
Devonshire
,
and
many
year
His
Majesty
's
representative
at
various
European
Courts

<EOS>
He
hath
leave
behind
him
a
name
which
be
endear
to
all
his
friend
for
his
manifold
virtue
and
talent

a

an
inconsolable

<EOS>
Her

the
bereave
Countess

be
at
the
Bath
when
the
horrid
intelligence
reach
her
of
her
husband
's
demise
,
and
hasten
to
Ireland
immediately
in
order
to
pay
her
last
sad
duty
to
his
beloved
remain
.
"
  
<EOS>
that
very
night
I
order
my
chariot
and
post
to
Ostend
,
whence
<EOS>
I
freight
a
vessel
to
Dover
,
and
travel
rapidly
into
the
West
,
reach
Bristol
;
from
which
port
I
embark
for
Waterford
,
and
find
myself
,
after
an
absence
of
eleven
year
,
in
my
native
country
.
   
<EOS>
I
return
to
IRELAND
,
and
exhibit
my
SPLENDOUR
and
GENEROSITY
in
that
<EOS>
kingdom
 
<EOS>
how
be
time
change
with
me
now
!
<EOS>
I
have
leave
my
country
a
poor
penniless
boy
 
a
private
soldier
in
a
miserable
marching
regiment
.
<EOS>
I
return
an
accomplished
man
,
with
property
to
the
amount
of
five
thousand
guinea
in
my
possession
,
with
a
splendid
wardrobe
and
jewel
-
case
worth
two
thousand
more
;
have
mingle
in
all
the
scene
of
life
a
not
undistinguished
actor
in
them
;
have
share
in
war
and
in
love
;
have
by
my
own
genius
and
energy
win
my
way
from
poverty
and
obscurity
to
competence
and
splendour
.
<EOS>
as
I
look
out
from
my
chariot
window
as
it
roll
along
over
the
bleak
bare
road
,
by
the
miserable
cabin
of
the
peasantry
,
who
come
out
in
their
rag
to
stare
as
the
splendid
equipage
pass
,
and
huzza'd
<EOS>
for
his
lordship
's
honour
as
they
see
the
magnificent
stranger
in
the
superb
gild
vehicle
,
my
huge
body
-
servant
Fritz
lolling
behind
with
curl
moustache
and
long
queue
,
his
green
livery
bar
with
silver
lace
,
I
could
not
help
think
of
myself
with
considerable
complacency
,
and
thank
my
star
that
have
endow
me
with
so
many
good
quality
.
<EOS>
but
for
my
own
merit
I
should
have
be
a
raw
irish
squireen
such
as
those
I
see
swagger
about
the
wretched
town
through
which
my
chariot
pass
on
its
road
to
Dublin
.
<EOS>
I
may
have
marry
Nora
Brady
<EOS>
(
and
though
,
thank
Heaven
,
I
do
not
,
I
have
never
think
of
that
girl
but
with
kindness
,
and
even
remember
the
bitterness
of
lose
her
more
clearly
at
this
moment
than
any
other
incident
of
my
life
)
;
I
may
have
be
the
father
of
ten
child
by
this
time
,
or
a
farmer
on
my
own
account
,
or
an
agent
to
a
squire
,
or
a
gauger
,
or
an
attorney
;
and
here
I
be
one
of
the
most
famous
gentleman
of
Europe
!
<EOS>
I
bade
my
fellow
get
a
bag
of
copper
money
and
throw
it

I

me
there

My

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
in

for
whom
my
regard
be
small

and
my
uncle

whom
I
have
always
love

<EOS>
I
ask
my
old
companion
the
blacksmith
,
who
have
beat
me
so
often
in
old
day
,
to
give
my
horse
a
feed
and
a
litter
:
he
be
a
wear
weary
-
looking
man
now
,
with
a
dozen
dirty
ragged
child
paddle
about
his
smithy
,
and
have
no
recollection
of
the
fine
gentleman
who
stand
before
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
seek
to
recall
my
-
self
to
his
memory
till
the
next
day
,
when
I
put
ten
guinea
into
his
hand
,
and
bade
him
drink
the
health
of
English
Redmond
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
Castle
Brady
,
the
gate
of
the
park
be
still
there
;
but
the
old
tree
be
cut
down
in
the
avenue
,
a
black
stump
jut
out
here
and
there
,
and
cast
long
shadow
as
I
pass
in
the

over
the

<EOS>
a

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
I
sit
down
on
the
old
bench
,
where
I
have
sit
on
the
day
when
Nora
jilt
me
;
and
I
do
believe
my
feeling
be
as
strong
then
as
they
have
be
when
I
be
a
boy
,
eleven
year
before
;
and
I
catch
myself
almost
cry
again
,
to
think
that
Nora
Brady
have
desert
me
.
<EOS>
I
believe
a
man
forget
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
a
flower
,
or
hear
some
trivial
word
or
two
,
which
have
awaken
recollection
that
somehow
have
lain
dormant
for
score
of
year
;
and
when
I
enter
the
house
in
Clarges
Street
,
where
I
be
bear
(
it
be
use
as
a
gambling
-
house
when
I
first
visit
London
)
,
<EOS>
all
of
a
sudden
the
memory
of
my
childhood
come
back
to
me
 
of
my
actual
infancy
:
I
recollect
my
father
in
green
and
gold
,
hold
me
up
to
look
at
a
gilt
coach
which
stand
at
the
door
,
and
my
mother
in
a
flowered
sack
,
with
patch
on
her
face
.
<EOS>
some
day
,
I
wonder
,
will
everything
we
have
see
and
think
and
do
come
and
flash
across
our
mind
in
this
way
?
<EOS>
I
have
rather
not
.
<EOS>
I
feel
so
as
I
sit
upon
the
bench
at
Castle
Brady
,
and
think
of
the
bygone
time
.
  
<EOS>
the
hall
-
door
be
open
 
<EOS>
it
be
always
so
at
that
house
;
the
moon
be
flare
in
at
the
long
old
window
,
and
throw
ghastly
chequer
upon
the
floor
;
and
the
star
be
look
in
on
the
other
side
,
in
the
blue
of
the
yawn
window
over
the
great
stair
:
<EOS>
from
it
you
could
see
the
old
stable
-
clock
,
with
the
letter
glisten
on
it
still
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
jolly
horse
in
those
stable
once
;
and
I
could
see
my
uncle
's
honest
face
,
and
hear
him
talk
to
his
dog
as
they
come
jump
and
whining
and
barking
round
about
him
of
a
gay
winter
morning
.
<EOS>
We
use
to
mount
there
;
and
the
girl
look
out
at
us
from
the
hall
-
window
,
where
I
stand
and
look
at
the
sad
,
mouldy
,
lonely
old
place
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
red
light
shine
through
the
crevice
of
a
door
at
one
corner
of
the
building
,
and
a
dog
presently
come
out
bay
loudly
,
and
a
limping
man
follow
with
a
fowling
-
piece
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
there
?
"
say
the
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
PHIL
PURCELL
,
do
not
you
know
me
?
"
shout
I
;
"
it
be
Redmond
Barry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
think
the
old
man
would
have
fire
his
piece
at
me
at
first
,
for
he
point
it
at
the
window
;
but
I
call
to
him
to
hold
his
hand
,
and
come
down
and
embrace
him
....
<EOS>
Psha
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
to
tell
the
rest
:
<EOS>
Phil
and
<EOS>
I
have
a
long
night
,
and
talk
over
a
thousand
foolish
old
thing
that
have
no
interest
for
any
soul
alive
now
:
for
what
soul
be
there
alive
that
care
for
Barry
Lyndon
?
  
<EOS>
I
settle
a
hundred
guinea
on
the
old
man
when
I
get
to
Dublin
,
and
make
him
an
annuity
which
enable
him
to
pass
his
old
day
in
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Phil
Purcell
be
amuse
himself
at
a
game
of
exceedingly
dirty
card
with
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
;
no
other
than
Tim
,
who
be
call
my
"
valet
"
in
the
day
of
yore
,
and
whom
the
reader
may
remember
as
clothe
in
my
father
's
old
livery
.
<EOS>
They
use
to
hang
about
him
in
those
time
,
and
lap
over
his
wrist
and
down
to
his
heel
;
but
Tim
,
though
he
protest
he
have
nigh
kill
himself
with
grief
when
I
go
away
,
have
manage
to
grow
enormously
fat
in
my
absence
,
and
would
have
fit
almost
into
Daniel
Lambert
's
coat
,
or
that
of
the
vicar
of
Castle
Brady
,
whom
he
serve
in
the
capacity
of
clerk
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
engage
the
fellow
in
my
service
but
for
his
monstrous
size
,
which
render
him
quite
unfit
to
be
the
attendant
of
any
gentleman
of
condition
;
and
so
I
present
him
with
a
handsome
gratuity
,
and
promise
to
stand
godfather
to
his
next
child
:
<EOS>
the
eleventh
since
my
absence
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
country
in
the
world
where
the
work
of
multiplying

on
so
prosperously
as
in

island

<EOS>
Mr.
Tim
have
marry
the

who
have
be
a
kind
friend

I
have
to
go
salute
poor
Molly
next
day

and
find
her
a
slatternly
wench
in
a
mud
hut
,
surround
by
a
brood

child
almost
as
ragged
as
those

my
friend

<EOS>
from
Tim

Phil
Purcell

thus
meet
fortuitously
together

I

<EOS>
Poor
Nora
,
he
add

have
make
many
addition
to
the
illustrious
race

Quin

and
my

Ulick

come
to
little
good

both
my
informant
fear

and
have
manage
to
run
through
the
small
available
remain
of
property
which
my
good
old
uncle
have
leave
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
see
I
should
have
no
small
family
to
provide
for
;
and
then
,
to
conclude
the
evening
,
Phil
,
Tim
,
and
I
,
have
a
bottle
of
usquebaugh
,
the
taste
of
which
I
have
remember
for
eleven
good
year
,
and
do
not
part
except
with
the
warm
term
of
fellowship
,
and
until
the
sun
have
be
some
time
in
the
sky
.
<EOS>
I
be
exceedingly
affable
;
that
have
always
be
one
of
my
characteristic
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
false
pride
,
as
many
man
of
high
lineage
like
my
own
have
,
and
,
in
default
of
well
company
,
will
hob
and
nob
with
a
ploughboy
or
a
private
soldier
just
as
readily
as
with
the
first
noble
in
the
land
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
back
to
the
village
in
the
morning
,
and
find
a
pretext
for
visit
Barryville
under
a
device
of
purchase
drug
.
<EOS>
the
hook
be
still
in
the
wall
where
my
silver

hike
sword
use
to
hang
;
a
blister
be
lie
on
the
window
-
sill
,
where
my
mother
's
"
Whole
Duty
of
Man
"
have
its
place
;
and
the
odious
Doctor
Macshane
have
find
out
who
I
be
<EOS>
(
my
countryman
find
out
everything
,
and
a
great
deal
more
besides
)
,
and
sniggering
,
ask
me
how
I
leave
the
King
of
Prussia
,
and
whether
my
friend
the
Emperor
Joseph
be
as
much
like
as
the
Empress
Maria
Theresa
have
be
.
<EOS>
the
bell
-
ringer
would
have
have
a
ring
of
bell
for
me
,
but
there
be
but
one
,
Tim
,
who
be
too
fat
to
pull
;
<EOS>
and
I
ride
off
before
the
vicar
,
Doctor
Bolter
(
who
have
succeed
old
Mr.
Texter
,
who
have
the
living
in
my
time
)
,
have
time
to
come
out
to
compliment
me
;
but
the
rapscallion
of
the
beggarly
village
have
assemble
in
a
dirty
army
to
welcome
me
,
and
cheer
"
Hurrah
for
Masther
Redmond
!
"
<EOS>
as
I
ride
away
.
  
<EOS>
My
people
be
not
a
little
anxious
regard
me
,
by
the
time
I
return
to
Carlow
,
and
the
landlord
be
very
much
afraid
,
he
say
,
that
the
highwayman
have
get
hold
of
me
.
<EOS>
there
,
too
,
my
name
and
station
have
be
learn
from
my
servant
Fritz
:
who
have
not
spare
his
praise
of
his
master
,
and
have
invent
some
magnificent
history
concern
me
.
<EOS>
He
say
it
be
the
truth
that
I
be
intimate
with
half
the
sovereign
of
Europe
,
and
the
prime
favourite
with
most
of
them
.
<EOS>
indeed
I
have
make
my
uncle
's
order
of
the
Spur
hereditary
,
and
travel
under
the
name
of
the
Chevalier
Barry
,
chamberlain
to
the
Duke
of
Hohenzollern
-
Sigmaringen
.
  
<EOS>
They
give
me
the
good
horse
the
stable
possess
to
carry
me
on
my
road
to
Dublin
,
and
the
strong
rope
for
harness
;
and
we
get
on
pretty
well
,
and
there
be
no
rencontre
between
the
highwayman
and
the
pistol
with
which
Fritz
and
I
be
provide
.
<EOS>
We
lie
that
night
at
Kilcullen
,
and
the
next
day
I
make
my
entry
into
the
city
of
Dublin
,
with
four
horse
to
my
carriage
,
five
thousand
guinea
in
my
purse
,
and
one
of
the
most
brilliant
reputation
in
Europe
,
have
quit
the
city
a
beggarly
boy
,
eleven
year
before
.
  
<EOS>
the
citizen
of
Dublin
have
as
great
and
laudable
a
desire
for
know
their
neighbour
'
concern
as
the
country
people
have
;
and
it
be
impossible
for
a
gentleman
,
however
modest
<EOS>
his
desire
may
be
(
and
such
mine
have
notoriously
be
through
life
)
,
to
enter
the
capital
without
have
his
name
print
in
every
newspaper
and
mention
in
a
number
of
society
.
<EOS>
My
name
and
title
be
all
over
the
town
the
day
after
my
arrival
.
<EOS>
a
great
number
of
polite
person
do
me
the
honour
to
call
at
my
lodging
,
when
I
select
them
;
and
this
be
a
point
very
necessarily
of
immediate
care
,
for
the
hotel
in
the
town
be
but
vulgar
hole
,
unfit
for
a
nobleman
of
my
fashion
and
elegance
.
<EOS>
I
have
be
inform
of
the
fact
by
traveller
on
the
continent
;
and
determine
to
fix
on
a
lodging
at
once
,
I
bid
the
driver
go
slowly
up
and
down
the
street
with
my
chariot
,
until
I
have
select
a
place
suitable
to
my
rank
.
<EOS>
this
proceeding
,
and
the
uncouth
question
and
behaviour
of
my
German
Fritz
,
who
be
instruct
to
make
inquiry
at
the
different
house
until
convenient
apartment
could
be
light
upon
,
bring
an
immense
mob
round
my
coach
;
and
by
the
time
the
room
be
choose
you
may
have
suppose
I
be
the
new
General
of
the
Forces
<EOS>
,
so
great
be
the
multitude
follow
us
.
  
<EOS>
I
fix
at
length
upon
a
handsome
suite
of
apartment
in
Capel
Street
,
pay
the
ragged
postilion
who
have
drive
me
a
splendid
gratuity
,
and
establish
myself
in
the
room
with
my
baggage
and
Fritz
,
desire
the
landlord
to
engage
me
a
second
fellow
to
wear
my
livery
,
a
couple
of
stout
reputable
chairman
and
their
machine
,
and
a
coachman
who
have
handsome
job
-
horse
to
hire
for
my
chariot
,
and
serviceable
riding
-
horse
to
sell
.
<EOS>
I
give
him
a
handsome
sum
in
advance
;
and
I
promise
you
the
effect
of
my
advertisement
be
such
,
that
next
day
I
have
a
regular
levee
in
my
antechamber
:
<EOS>
groom
,
valet
,
and
maitres
-
d'hotel
offer
themselves
without
number
;
I
have
proposal
for
the
purchase
of
horse
sufficient
to
mount
a
regiment
,
both
from
dealer
and
gentleman
of
the
first
fashion
.
<EOS>
Sir
Lawler
Gawler
come
to
propose
to
me
the
most
elegant
bay
-
mare
ever
step
;
my
Lord
Dundoodle
have
a
team
of
four
that
would
not
disgrace
my
friend
the
Emperor
;
and
the
Marquess
of
Ballyragget
send
his
gentleman
and
his
compliment
,
state
that
if
I
would
step
up
to
his
stable
,
or
do
him
the
honour
of
breakfast
with
him
previously
,
he
would
show
me
the
two
fine
grey
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
I
determine
to
accept
the
invitation
of
Dundoodle
and
Ballyragget
,
but
to
purchase
my
horse
from
the
dealer
.
<EOS>
It
be
always
the
good
way
.
<EOS>
besides
,
in
those
day
,
in
Ireland
,
if
a
gentleman
warrant
his
horse
,
and
it
be
not
sound
,
or
a
dispute
arise
,
the
remedy
you
have
be
the
offer
of
a
bullet
in
your
waistcoat
.
<EOS>
I
have
play
at
the
bullet
game
too
much
in
earnest
to
make
use
of
it
heedlessly
:
and
I
may
say
,
proudly
for
myself
,
that
I
never
engage
in
a
duel
unless
I
have
a
real
,
available
,
and
prudent
reason
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
simplicity
about
this
irish
gentry
which
amuse
and
make
me
wonder
.
<EOS>
if
they
tell
more
fib
than
their
downright
neighbour
across
the
water
,
on
the
other
hand
they
believe
more
;
and
I
make
myself
in
a
single
week
such
a
reputation
in
Dublin
as
would
take
a
man
ten
year
and
a
mint
of
money
to
acquire
in
London
.
<EOS>
I
have
win
five
hundred
thousand
pound
at
play
;
I
be
the
favourite
of
the
Empress
Catherine
of
Russia
;
the
confidential
agent
of
Frederick
of
Prussia
;
it
be
I
win
the
battle
of
Hochkirchen
;
I
be
the
cousin
of
Madame
Du
Barry
,
the
french
King
's
favourite
,
and
a
thousand
thing
beside
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
hint
a
number
of
these
story
to
my
kind
friend
Ballyragget
and
Gawler
;
and
they
be
not
slow
to
improve
the
hint
I
give
them
.
  
<EOS>
after
have
witness
the
splendour
of
civilised
life
abroad
,
the
sight
of
Dublin
in
the
year
1771
,
when
I
return
thither
,
strike
me
with
anything
but
respect
.
<EOS>
It
be
as
savage
as
Warsaw
almost
,
without
the
regal
grandeur
of
the
latter
city
.
<EOS>
the
people
look
more
ragged
than
any
race
I
have
ever
see
,
except
the
gipsy
horde
along
the
bank
of
the
Danube
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
as
I
have
say
,
not
an
inn
in
the
town
fit
for
a
gentleman
of
condition
to
dwell
in
.
<EOS>
those
luckless
fellow
who
could
not
keep
a
carriage
,
and
walk
the
street
at
night
,
run
imminent
risk
of
the
knife
of
the
woman
and
ruffian
who
lay
in
wait
there
,
 
of
a
set
of
ragged
savage
villain
,
who
neither
know
the
use
of
shoe
nor
razor
;
and
as
a
gentleman
enter
his
chair
or
his
chariot
,
to
be
carry
to
his
evening
rout
,
or
the
play
,
the
flambeaux
of
the
footman
would
light
up
such
a
set
of
wild
gibber
milesian
face
as
would
frighten
a
genteel
person
of
average
nerve
.
<EOS>
I
be
luckily
endow
with
strong
one
;
besides
,
have
see
my
amiable
countryman
before
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
this
description
of
them
will
excite
anger
among
some
irish
patriot
,
who
do
not
like
to
have
the
nakedness
of
our
land
abuse
,
and
be
angry
if
the
whole
truth
be
tell
concern
it
.
<EOS>
but
bah
!
<EOS>
it
be
a
poor
provincial
place
,
Dublin
,
in
the
old
day
of
which
I
speak
;
and
<EOS>
many
a
tenth
-
rate
german
residency
be
more
genteel
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
it
be
true
,
near
three
hundred
resident
peer
at
the
period
;
and
a
House
of
Commons
;
and
my
Lord
Mayor
and
his
corporation
;
and
a
roystering
noisy
University
,
whereof
the
student
make
no
small
disturbance
nightly
,
patronise
the
roundhouse
,
duck
obnoxious
printer
and
tradesman
,
and
give
the
law
at
the
Crow
Street
Theatre
.
<EOS>
but
I
have
see
too
much
of
the
first
society
of
Europe
to
be
much
tempt
by
the
society
of
these
noisy
gentry
,
and
be
a
little
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
mingle
with
the
dispute
and
politic
of
my
Lord
Mayor
and
his
Aldermen
.
<EOS>
in
the
House
of
Commons
there
be
some
dozen
of
right
pleasant
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
never
hear
in
the
English
Parliament
well
speech
than
from
Flood
,
and
Daly
,
of
Galway
.
<EOS>
Dick
Sheridan
,
though
not
a
well
-
breed
person
,
be
as
amusing
and
ingenious
a
table
-
companion
as
ever
I
meet
;
and
though
during
Mr.
Edmund
Burke
's
interminable
speech
in
the
English
House
I
use
always
to
go
to
sleep
,
I
yet
have
hear
from
well
-
inform
party
that
Mr.
Burke
be
a
person
of
considerable
ability
,
and
even
repute
to
be
eloquent
in
his
more
favourable
moment
.
  
<EOS>
I
soon
begin
to
enjoy
to
the
full
extent
the
pleasure
that
the
wretched
place
afford
,
and
which
be
within
a
gentleman
's
reach
:
ranelagh
and
the
Ridotto
;
Mr.
Mossop
,
at
Crow
Street
;
my
Lord
Lieutenant
's
party
,
where
there
be
a
great
deal
too
much
boozing
,
and
too
little
play
,
to
suit
a
person
of
my
elegant
and
refined
habit
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Daly
's
Coffee
-
house
,
"
and
the
house
of
the
nobility
,
be
soon
open
to
me
;
and
I
remark
with
astonishment
in
the
high
circle
,
what
I
have
experience
in
the
low
on
my
first
unhappy
visit
to
Dublin
,
an
extraordinary
want
of
money
,
and
a
preposterous
deal
of
promissory
note
fly
about
,
for
which
I
be
quite
unwilling
to
stake
my
guinea
.
<EOS>
the
lady
,
too
,
be
mad
for
play
;
but
exceed
unwilling
to
pay
when
they
lose
.
<EOS>
thus
,
when
the
old
Countess
of
Trumpington
lose
ten
piece
to
me
at
quadrille
,
she
give
me
,
instead
of
the
money
,
her
Ladyship
's
note
of
hand
on
her
agent
in
Galway
;
which
I
put
,
with
a
great
deal
of
politeness
,
into
the
candle
.
<EOS>
but
when
the
Countess
make
me
a
second
proposition
to
play
,
I
say
that
as
soon
as
her
Ladyship
's
remittance
be
arrive
,
I
would
be
the
readiest
person
to
meet
her
;
but
till
then
be
her
very
humble
servant
.
<EOS>
and
I
maintain
this
resolution
and
singular
character
throughout
the
Dublin
society
:
give
out
at
"
Daly
's
"
that
I
be
ready
to
play
any
man
,
for
any
sum
,
at
any
game
;
or
to
fence
with
him
,
or
to
ride
with
him
<EOS>
(
regard
be
have
to
our
weight
)
,
or
to
shoot
fly
,
or
at
a
mark
;
and
in
this
latter
accomplishment
,
especially
if
the
mark
be
a
live
one
,
irish
gentleman
of
that
day
have
no
ordinary
skill
.
  
<EOS>
of
course
I
despatch
a
courier
in
my
livery
to
Castle
Lyndon
with
a
private
letter
for
Runt
,
demand
from
him
full
particular
of
the
Countess
of
Lyndon
's
state
of
health
and
mind
;
and
a
touching
and
eloquent
letter
to
her
Ladyship
,
in
which
I
bade
her
<EOS>
remember
ancient
day
,
which
I
tie
up
with
a
single
hair
from
the
lock
which
I
have
purchase
from
her
woman
,
and
in
which
I
tell
her
that
Sylvander
remember
his
oath
,
and
could
never
forget
his
Calista
.
<EOS>
the
answer
I
receive
from
her
be
exceedingly
unsatisfactory
and
inexplicit
;
that
from
Mr.
Runt
explicit
enough
,
but
not
at
all
pleasant
in
its
content
.
<EOS>
My
Lord
George
Poynings
,
the
Marquess
of
Tiptoff
's
young
son
,
be
pay
very
marked
address
to
the
widow

of
the
family

and
have
be
call
to
Ireland
relative
to
the
will
of
the
deceased
Sir
Charles
Lyndon

<EOS>
now
,
there
be
a
sort
of
rough
-
and
-
ready
law
in
Ireland
in
those
day
,
which
be
of
great
convenience
to
person
desirous
of
expeditious
justice
;
and
of
which
the
newspaper
of
the
time
contain
a
hundred
proof

<EOS>

Ensign
Steele
,
be
repeatedly
send
warn
letter

and
murder

the
note
be
unattende
to
.
<EOS>
the
celebrated
Captain
Thunder
rule
in
the
southern
county
,
and
his
business
seem
to
be
to
procure
wife
for
gentleman
who
have
not
sufficient
mean
to
please
the
parent
of
the
young
lady
;
or
,
perhaps
,
have
not
time
for
a
long
and
intricate
courtship
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
find
my
cousin
Ulick
at
Dublin
,
grow
very
fat
,
and
very
poor
;
hunt
up
by
Jews
and
creditor
:
dwell
in
all
sort
of
queer
corner
,
from
which
he
issue
at
nightfall
to
the
Castle
,
or
to
his
card
-
party
at
his
tavern
;
but
he
be
always
the
courageous
fellow
:
and
I
hint
to
him
the
state
of
my
affection
regard
Lady
Lyndon
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
Countess
of
Lyndon
!
"
say
poor
Ulick
;
"
well
,
that
be
a
wonder

<EOS>
I
myself
have
be
mightily
sweet
upon
a
young
lady
,
one
of
the
Kiljoys
of
Ballyhack
,
who
have
ten
thousand
pound
to
her
fortune
,
and
to
whom
her

be
guardian

but
how
be
a
poor
fellow
without
a
coat
to
his
back
to
get
on
with
an
heiress
in
such
company
as
that
?
<EOS>
I
may
as
well
propose
for
the
Countess
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
well

"
say
I
,
laugh
;
"
the
man
who
try
run
a
chance
of
go
out
of
the
world
first

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
and
I
explain
to
him
my
own
intention
regard
Lady
Lyndon
.
<EOS>
Honest
Ulick
,
whose
respect
for
me
be
prodigious
when
he
see
how
splendid
my
appearance
be
,
and
hear
how
wonderful
my
adventure
and
great
my
experience
of
fashionable
life
have
be
,
be
lose
in
admiration
of
my
daring
and
energy
,
when
I
confide
to
him
my
intention
of
marry
the
great
heiress
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
I
bid
Ulick
go
out
of
town
on
any
pretext
he
choose
,
and
put
a
letter
into
a
post
-
office
near
Castle
Lyndon
,
which
I
prepare
in
a
feigned
hand
,
and
in
which
I
give
a
solemn
warning
to
Lord
George
Poynings
to
quit
the
country
;
say
that
the
great
prize
be
never
mean
for
the
like
of
him
,
and
that
there
be
heiress
enough
in
England
,
without
come
to
rob
them
out
of
the
domain
of
Captain
Fireball
.
<EOS>
the
letter
be
write
on
a
dirty
piece
of
paper
,
in
the
bad
of
spelling
:
it
come
to
my
Lord
by
the
post

conveyance
,
and
,
be
a
high
-
spirited
young
man
,
he
of
course
laugh
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
as
ill
-
luck
would
have
it
for
him
,
he
appear
in
Dublin
a
very
short
time
afterwards
;
be
introduce
to
the
Chevalier
Redmond
Barry
,
at
the
Lord
Lieutenant
's
table
;
adjourn
with
him
and
several
other
gentleman
to
the
club
at
"
Daly
's
,
"
and
there
,
in
a
dispute
about
the
pedigree
of
a
horse
,
in
which
everybody
say
I
be
in
the
right
,
word
arise
,
and
a
meeting
be
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
I
have
have
no
affair
in
Dublin
since
my
arrival
,
and
people
be
anxious
to
see
whether
I
be
equal
to
my
reputation
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
boast
about
these
matter
,
but
always
do
them
when
the
time
come
;
and
poor
Lord
George
,
who
have
a
neat
hand
and
a
quick
eye
enough
,
but
be
breed
in
the
clumsy
english
school

until
I
have
determine
where
I
should
hit
him

<EOS>
My

go
in
under
his
guard

and
come
out
at
his

<EOS>
when
he
fall

he
good

naturedly
extend
his
hand
to
me
,
and
say
,
"
Mr.
Barry
,
I
be
wrong
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
feel
not
very
well
at
ease
when
the
poor
fellow
make
this
confession
:
for
the
dispute
have
be
of
my
making

and
,
to
tell
the

I

never

my

one
's
enough
:
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
my
plan
regard
him
,
and
determine
at
once
to
benefit
this
honest
fellow
,
and
to
forward
my
own
design
upon
the
widow
.
   
<EOS>
I
pay
court
to
my
lady
LYNDON
 
<EOS>
as
my
uncle
's
attainder
be
not
reverse
for
be
out
with
the
Pretender
in
1745
,
it
would
have
be
inconvenient
for
him
to
accompany
his
nephew
to
the
land
of
our
ancestor
;
where
,
if
not
hang
,
at
least
a
tedious
process
of
imprisonment
,
and
a
doubtful
pardon
,
would
have
await
the
good
old
gentleman
.
<EOS>
in
any
important
crisis
of
my
life
,
his
advice
be
always
of
advantage
to
me
,
and
I
do
not
fail
to
seek
it
at
this
juncture
,
and
to
implore
his
counsel
as
regard
my
pursuit
of
the
widow
.
<EOS>
I
tell
him
the
situation
of
her
heart
,
as
I
have
describe
it
in
the
last
chapter
;
of
the
progress
that
young
Poynings
have
make
in
her
affection
,
and
of
her
forgetfulness
of
her
old
admirer
;
and
I
get
a
letter
,
in
reply
,
full
of
excellent
suggestion
,
by
which
I
do
not
fail
to
profit
.
<EOS>
the
kind
Chevalier
preface
it
by
say
,
that
he
be
for
the
present
boarding
in
the
Minorite
convent
at
Brussels
;
that
he
have
thought
of
make
his
salut
there
,
and
retire
for
ever
from
the
world
,
devote
himself
to
the
severe
practice
of
religion
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
he
write
with
regard
to
the
lovely
widow
:
it
be
natural
that
a
person
of
her
vast
wealth
and
not
disagreeable
person
should
have
many
adorer
about
her
;
and
that
,
as
in
her
husband
's
lifetime
she
have
show
herself
not
at
all
disincline
to
receive
my
address
,
I
must
make
no
manner
of
doubt
I
be
not
the
first
person
whom
she
have
so
favour
;
nor
be
I
likely
to
be
the
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
,
my
dear
child
,
"
he
add
,
"
that
the
ugly
attainder
round
my
neck
,
and
the
resolution
I
have
form
of
retire
from
a
world
of
sin
and
vanity
altogether
,
do
not
prevent
me
from
come
personally
to
your
aid
in
this
delicate
crisis
of
your
affair
;
for
,
to
lead
them
to
a
good
end
,
it
require
not
only
the
indomitable
courage
,
swagger
,
and
audacity
,
which
you
possess
beyond
any
young
man
I
have
ever
know
"
(
as
for
the
"
swagger
,
"
as
the
Chevalier
call
it
,
I
deny
it
in
toto
,
be
always
most
modest
in
my
demeanour
)
;
"
but
though
you
have
the
vigour
to
execute
,
you
have
not
the
ingenuity
to
suggest
plan
of
conduct
for
the
follow
out
of
a
scheme
that
be
likely
to
be
long
and
difficult
of
execution
.
<EOS>
Would
you
have
ever
think
of
the
brilliant
scheme
of
the
Countess
Ida
,
which
so
nearly
make
you
the
great
fortune
in
Europe
,
but
for
the
advice
and
experience
of
a
poor
old
man
,
now
make
up
his
account
with
the
world
,
and
about
to
retire
from
it
for
good
and
all
?
  
<EOS>
"
well
,
with
regard
to
the
Countess
of
Lyndon
,
your
manner
of
win
her
be
quite
en
l'air
at
present
to
me
;
nor
can
I
advise
day
by
day
,
as
I
would
I
could
,
accord
to
circumstance
as
they
arise
.
<EOS>
but
your
general
scheme
should
be
this
.
<EOS>
if
I
remember
the
letter
you
use
to
have
from
her
during
the
period
of
the
correspondence
which
the
silly
woman
entertain
you
with
,
much
high
-
fly
sentiment
pass
between
you
;
and
especially
be
write
by
her
Ladyship
herself
:
she
be
a
blue
-
stocking
,
and
fond
of
writing
;
she
use
to
make
her
griefs
with
her
husband
the
continual
theme
of
her
correspondence
(
as
woman
will
do
)
.
<EOS>
I
recollect
several
passage
in
her
letter
bitterly
deplore
her
fate
in
be
unite
to
one
so
unworthy
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
surely
,
in
the
mass
of
billet
you
possess
from
her
,
there
must
be
enough
to
compromise
her
.
<EOS>
look
them
well
over
;
select
passage
,
and
threaten
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
write
to
her
at
first
in
the
undoubte
tone
of
a
lover
who
have
every
claim
upon
her
.
<EOS>
then
,
if
she
be
silent
,
remonstrate
,
allude
to
former
promise
from
her
;
produce
proof
of
her
former
regard
for
you
;
vow
despair
,
destruction
,
revenge
,
if
she
prove
unfaithful
.
<EOS>
frighten
her
 
astonish
her
by
some
daring
feat
,
which
will
let
her
see
your
indomitable
resolution
<EOS>
:
you
be
the
man
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
Your
sword
have
a
reputation
in
Europe
,
and
you
have
a
character
for
boldness
;
which
be
the
first
thing
that
cause
my
Lady
Lyndon
to
turn
her
eye
upon
you
.
<EOS>
make
the
people
talk
about
you
at
Dublin
.
<EOS>
be
as
splendid
,
and
as
brave
,
and
as
odd
as
possible
.
<EOS>
how
I
wish
I
be
near
you
!
<EOS>
You
have
no
imagination
to
invent
such
a
character
as
I
would
make
for
you
 
but
why
speak
;
have
I
not
have
enough
of
the
world
and
its
vanity
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
be
much
practical
good
sense
in
this
advice
;
which
I
quote
,
unaccompanied
with
the
lengthen
description
of
his
mortification
and
devotion
which
my
uncle
indulge
in
,
finish
his
letter
,
as
usual
,
with
earnest
prayer
for
my
conversion
to
the
true
faith
.
<EOS>
but
he
be
constant
to
his
form
of
worship
;
and
I
,
as
a
man
of
honour
and
principle
,
be
resolute
to
mine
;
and
have
no
doubt
that
the
one
,
in
this
respect
,
will
be
as
acceptable
as
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
under
these
direction
it
be
,
then
,
I
write
to
Lady
Lyndon
,
to
ask
on
my
arrival
when
the
most
respectful
of
her
admirer
may
be
permit
to
intrude
upon
her
grief
?
<EOS>
then
,
as
her
ladyship
be
silent
,
I
demand
,
have
she
forget
old
time
,
and
one
whom
she
have
favour
with
her
intimacy
at
a
very
happy
period
?
<EOS>
have
Calista
forget
Eugenio
?
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
I
send
down
by
my
servant
with
this
letter
a
present
of
a
little
sword
for
Lord
Bullingdon
,
and
a
private
note
to
his
governor
;
whose
note
of
hand
,
by
the
way
,
I
possess
for
a
sum
 
<EOS>
I
forget
what
 
but
such
as
the
poor
fellow
would
have
be
very
unwilling
to
pay
.
<EOS>
to
this
an
answer
come
from
her
Ladyship
's
amanuensis
,
state
that
Lady
Lyndon
be
too
much
disturb
by
grief
at
her
recent
dreadful
calamity
to
see
any
one
but
her
own
relation
;
and
advice
from
my
friend
,
the
boy
's
governor
,
state
that
my
Lord
George
Poynings
be
the
young
kinsman
who
be
about
to
console
her
.
  
<EOS>
this
cause
the
quarrel
between
me
and
the
young
nobleman
;
whom
I
take
care
to
challenge
on
his
first
arrival
at
Dublin
.
  
<EOS>
when
the
news
of
the
duel
be
bring
to
the
widow
at
Castle
Lyndon
,
my
informant
write
me
that
Lady
Lyndon
shriek
and
fling
down
the
journal
,
and
say
,
"
the
horrible
monster
!
<EOS>
He
would
not
shrink
from
murder
,
I
believe
;
"
and
little
Lord
Bullingdon
,
draw
his
sword
 
the
sword
I
have
give
him
,
the
rascal
!
 
<EOS>
declare
he
would
kill
with
it
the
man
who
have
hurt
Cousin
George
.
<EOS>
on
Mr.
Runt
tell
him
that
I
be
the
donor
of
the
weapon
,
the
little
rogue
still
vow
that
he
would
kill
me
all
the
same
!
<EOS>
indeed
,
in
spite
of
my
kindness
to
him
,
that
boy
always
seem
to
detest
me
.
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
send
up
daily
courier
to
inquire
after
the
health
of
Lord
George
;
and
,
think
to
myself
that
she
would
probably
be
induce
to
come
to
Dublin
if
she
be
to
hear
that
he
be
in
danger
<EOS>
,
I
manage
to
have
her
inform
that
he
be
in
a
precarious
state
;
that
he
grow
bad
;
that
Redmond
Barry
have
flee
in
consequence
:
of
this
flight
I
cause
the
Mercury
newspaper
to
give
notice
also
,
but
indeed
it
do
not
carry
me
beyond
the
town
of
Bray
,
where
my
poor
mother
dwell
;
and
where
,
under
the
difficulty
of
a
duel
,
I
may
be
sure
of
have
a
welcome
.
  
<EOS>
those
reader
who
have
the
sentiment
of
filial
duty
strong
in
their
mind
,
will
wonder
that
I
have
not
yet
describe
my
interview
with
that
kind
mother
whose
sacrifice
for
me
in
youth
have
be
so
considerable
,
and
for
whom
a
man
of
my
warm
and
affectionate
nature
could
not
but
feel
the
most
enduring
and
sincere
regard
.
  
<EOS>
but
a
man
,
move
in
the
exalted
sphere
of
society
in
which
I
now
stand
,
have
his
public
duty
to
perform
before
he
consult
his
private
affection
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
upon
my
first
arrival
,
I
despatch
a
messenger
to
Mrs.
Barry
,
state
my
arrival
,
convey
to
her
my
sentiment
of
respect
and
duty
,
and
promise
to
pay
them
to
her
personally
so
soon
as
my
business
in
Dublin
would
leave
me
free
.
  
<EOS>
this
,
I
need
not
say
,
be
very
considerable
.
<EOS>
I
have
my
horse
to
buy
,
my
establishment
to
arrange
,
my
entree
into
the
genteel
world
to
make
;
and
,
have
announce
my
intention
to
purchase
horse
and
live
in
a
genteel
style
,
be
in
a
couple
of
day
so
pester
by
visit
of
the
nobility
and
gentry
,
and
so
hamper
by
invitation
to
dinner
and
supper
,
<EOS>
that
it
become
exceedingly
difficult
for
me
during
some
day
to
manage
my
anxiously
desire
visit
to
Mrs.
Barry
.
  
<EOS>
It
appear
that
the
good
soul
provide
an
entertainment
as
soon
as
she
hear
of
my
arrival
,
and
invite
all
her
humble
acquaintance
of
Bray
to
be
present
:
but
I
be
engage
subsequently
to
my
Lord
Ballyragget
on
the
day
appoint
,
and
be
,
of
course
,
oblige
to
break
the
promise
that
I
have
make
to
Mrs.
Barry
to
attend
her
humble
festival
.
  
<EOS>
I
endeavour
to
sweeten
the
disappointment
by
send
my
mother
a
handsome
satin
sack
and
velvet
robe
,
which
I
purchase
for
her
at
the
good
mercer
in
Dublin
(
and
indeed
tell
her
I
have
bring
from
Paris
expressly
for
her
)
;
but
the
messenger
whom
I
despatch
with
the
present
bring
back
the
parcel
,
with
the
piece
of
satin
tear
half
way
up
the
middle
:
and
I
do
not
need
his
description
to
be
aware
that
something
have
offend
the
good
lady
;
who
come
out
,
he
say
,
and
abuse
him
at
the
door
,
and
would
have
box
his
car
,
but
that
she
be
restrain
by
a
gentleman
in
black
;
who
I
conclude
,
with
justice
,
be
her
clerical
friend
Mr.
Jowls
.
  
<EOS>
this
reception
of
my
present
make
me
rather
dread
than
hope
for
an
interview
with
Mrs.
Barry
,
and
delay
my
visit
to
her
for
some
day
further
.
<EOS>
I
write
her
a
dutiful
and
soothing
letter
,
to
which
there
be
no
answer
return
;
although
I
mention
that
on
my
way
to
the
capital
I
have
be
at
Barryville
,
and
revisit
the
old
haunt
of
my
youth
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
to
own
that
she
be
the
only
human
being
whom
I
be
afraid
to
face
.
<EOS>
I
can
recollect
her
fit
of
anger
as
a
child
,
and
the
reconciliation
,
which
use
to
be
still
more
violent
and
painful
:
and
so
,
instead
of
go
myself
,
I
send
my
factotum
,
Ulick
Brady
,
to
her
;
who
ride
back
,
say
that
he
have
meet
with
a
reception
he
would
not
again
undergo
for
twenty
guinea
;
that
he
have
be
dismiss
the
house
,
with
strict
injunction
to
inform
me
that
my
mother
disown
me
for
ever
.
<EOS>
this
parental
anathema
,
as
it
be
,
affect
me
much
,
for
I
be
always
the
most
dutiful
of
son
;
and
I
determine
to
go
as
soon
as
possible
,
and
brave
what
I
know
must
be
an
inevitable
scene
of
reproach
and
anger
,
for
the
sake
,
as
I
hope
,
of
as
certain
a
reconciliation
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
give
one
night
an
entertainment
to
some
of
the
genteel
company
in
Dublin
,
and
be
show
my
Lord
Marquess
downstairs
with
a
pair
of
wax
taper
,
when
I
find
a
woman
in
a
grey
coat
seat
at
my
doorstep
:
to
whom
,
take
her
for
a
beggar
<EOS>
,
I
tender
a
piece
of
money
,
and
whom
my
noble
friend
,
who
be
rather
hot
with
wine
,
begin
to
joke
,
as
my
door
close
and
I
bade
them
all
good
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
rather
surprised
and
affected
to
find
afterwards
that
the
hooded
woman
be
no
other
than
my
mother
;
whose
pride
have
make
her
vow
that
she
would
not
enter
my
door
,
but
whose
natural
maternal
yearning
have
make
her
long
to
see
her
son
's
face
once
again
,
and
who
have
thus
plant
herself
in
disguise
at
my
gate
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
have
find
in
my
experience
that
these
be
the
only
woman
who
never
deceive
a
man
,
and
whose
affection
remain
constant
through
all
trial
.
<EOS>
think
of
the
hour
that
the
kind
soul
must
have
pass
,
lonely
in
the
street
,
listen
to
the
din
and
merriment
within
my
apartment
,
the
clinking
of
the
glass
,
the
laughing
,
the
chorus
,
and
the
cheering
.
  
<EOS>
when
my
affair
with
Lord
George
happen
,
and
it
become
necessary
to
me
,
for
the
reason
I
have
state
,
to
be
out
of
the
way
;
now
,
think
I
,
be
the
time
to
make
my
peace
with
my
good
mother
:
she
will
never
refuse
me
an
asylum
now
that
I
seem
in
distress
.
<EOS>
so
send
to
her
a
notice
that
I
be
come
,
that
I
have
have
a
duel
which
have
bring
me
into
trouble
,
and
require
I
should
go
into
hiding
,
I
follow
my
messenger
half
-
an
-
hour
afterwards
:
and
,
I
warrant
me
<EOS>
,
there
be
no
want
of
a
good
reception
,
for
presently
,
be
introduce
into
an
empty
room
by
the
barefoote
maid
who
wait
upon
Mrs.
Barry
,
the
door
be
open
,
and
the
poor
mother
fling
herself
into
my
arm
with
a
scream
,
and
with
transport
of
joy
which
I
shall
not
attempt
to
describe
 
they
be
but
to
be
comprehend
by
woman
who
have
hold
in
their
arm
an
only
child
after
a
twelve
year
'
absence
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
the
Reverend
Mr.
Jowls
,
my
mother
's
director
,
be
the
only
person
to
whom
the
door
of
her
habitation
be
open
during
my
sojourn
;
and
he
would
take
no
denial
.
<EOS>
He
mix
for
himself
a
glass
of
rum
-
punch
,
which
he
seem
in
the
habit
of
drink
at
my
good
mother
's
charge
,
groan
aloud
,
and
forthwith
begin
read
me
a
lecture
upon
the
sinfulness
of
my
past
course
,
and
especially
of
the
last
horrible
action
I
have
be
commit
.
  
<EOS>
"
sinful
!
"
say
my
mother
,
bristle
up
when
her
son
be
attack
;
"
sure
we
be
all
sinner
;
and
it
be
you
,
Mr.
Jowls
,
who
have
give
me
the
inexpressible
blessing
to
let
me
know
that
.
<EOS>
but
how
else
would
you
have
have
the
poor
child
behave
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
have
the
gentleman
avoid
the
drink
,
and
the
quarrel
,
and
this
wicked
duel
altogether
,
"
answer
the
clergyman
.
  
<EOS>
but
my
mother
cut
him
short
,
by
say
such
sort
of
conduct
may
be
very
well
in
a
person
of
his
cloth
and
his
birth
,
but
it
neither
become
a
Brady
nor
a
Barry
.
<EOS>
in
fact
,
she
be
quite
delighted
with
the
thought
that
I
have
pink
an
English
marquis
's
son
in
a
duel
;
and
so
,
to
console
her
,
I
tell
her
of
a
score
more
in
which
I
have
be
engage
,
and
of
some
of
which
I
have
already
inform
the
reader
.
  
<EOS>
as
my
late
antagonist
be
in
no
sort
of
danger
when
I
spread
that
report
of
his
perilous
situation
,
there
be
no
particular
call
that
my
hiding
should
be
very
close
.
<EOS>
but
the
widow
do
not
know
the
fact
as
well
as
I
do
:
and
cause
her
house
to
be
barricade
,
and
Becky
,
her
barefoote
serving
-
wench
,
to
be
a
perpetual
sentinel
to
give
alarm
,
lest
the
officer
should
be
in
search
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
person
I
expect
,
however
,
be
my
cousin
Ulick
,
who
be
to
bring
me
the
welcome
intelligence
of
Lady
Lyndon
's
arrival
;
and
I
own
,
after
two
day
'
close
confinement
at
Bray
,
in
which
I
narrate
all
the
adventure
of
my
life
to
my
mother
,
and
succeed
in
make
her
accept
the
dress
she
have
formerly
refuse
,
and
a
considerable
addition
to
her
income
which
I
be
glad
to
make
,
I
be
very
glad
when
I
see
that
reprobate
Ulick
Brady
,
as
my
mother
call
him
,
ride
up
to
the
door
in
my
carriage
with
the
welcome
intelligence
for
my
mother
,
that
the
young
lord
be
out
of
danger
;
and
for
me
,
that
the
Countess
of
Lyndon
have
arrive
in
Dublin
.
  
<EOS>
"
and
I
wish
,
Redmond
,
that
the
young
gentleman
have
be
in
danger
a
little
longer
,
"
say
the
widow
,
her
eye
fill
with
tear
,
"
and
you
would
have
stay
so
much
the
more
with
your
poor
old
mother
.
<EOS>
"
but
I
dry
her
tear
,
embrace
her
warmly
,
and
promise
to
see
her
often
;
and
hint
I
would
have
,
mayhap
,
a
house
of
my
own
and
a
noble
daughter
to
welcome
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
who
be
she
,
Redmond
dear
?
"
say
the
old
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
one
of
the
noble
and
rich
woman
in
the
empire
,
mother
,
"
answer
I.
"
<EOS>
no
mere
Brady
this
time
<EOS>
,
"
I
add
,
laugh
:
with
which
hope
I
leave
Mrs.
Barry
in
the
good
of
temper
.
  
<EOS>
no
man
can
bear
less
malice
than
I
do
;
and
,
when
I
have
once
carry
my
point
,
I
be
one
of
the
most
placable
creature
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
week
in
Dublin
before
I
think
it
necessary
to
quit
that
capital
.
<EOS>
I
have
become
quite
reconcile
to
my
rival
in
that
time
;
make
a
point
of
call
at
his
lodging
,
and
speedily
become
an
intimate
consoler
of
his
bed
-
side
.
<EOS>
He
have
a
gentleman
to
whom
I
do
not
neglect
to
be
civil
,
and
towards
whom
I
order
my
people
to
be
particular
in
their
attention
;
for
I
be
naturally
anxious
to
learn
what
my
Lord
George
's
position
with
the
lady
of
Castle
Lyndon
have
really
be
,
whether
other
suitor
be
about
the
widow
,
and
how
she
would
bear
the
news
of
his
wound
.
  
<EOS>
the
young
nobleman
himself
enlighten
me
somewhat
upon
the
subject
I
be
most
desirous
to
inquire
into
.
  
<EOS>
"
Chevalier
,
"
say
he
to
me
one
morning
when
I
go
to
pay
him
my
compliment
,
"
I
find
you
be
an
old
acquaintance
with
my
kinswoman
,
the
Countess
of
Lyndon
.
<EOS>
She
write
me
a
page
of
abuse
of
you
in
a
letter
here
;
and
the
strange
part
of
the
story
be
this
,
that
one
day
when
there
be
talk
about
you
at
Castle
Lyndon
,
and
the
splendid
equipage
you
be
exhibit
in
Dublin
,
the
fair
widow
vow
and
protest
she
never
have
hear
of
you
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
oh
yes
,
mamma
,
"
say
the
little
Bullingdon
,
"
the
tall
dark
man
at
Spa
with
the
cast
in
his
eye
,
who
use
to
make
my
governor
tipsy
and
send
me
the
sword
:
his
name
be
Mr.
Barry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
my
Lady
order
the
boy
out
of
the
room
,
and
persist
in
know
nothing
about
you
.
"
  
"
and
be
you
a
kinsman
and
acquaintance
of
my
Lady
Lyndon
,
my
Lord
?

"
say
I
,
in
a
tone
of
grave
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
yes
,
indeed
,
"
answer
the
young
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
I
leave
her
house
but
to
get
this
ugly
wound
from
you
.
<EOS>
and
it
come
at
a
most
unlucky
time
too
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
why
more
unlucky
now
than
at
another
moment
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
,
look
you
,
Chevalier
,
I
think
the
widow
be
not
unpartial
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
may
have
induce
her
to
make
our
connection
a
little
close
:
and
faith
,
though
she
be
old
than
I
be

rich

now

My
Lord
George

I

will
you
let
me
ask
you

an
odd
question

he

<EOS>
I

I
passionately

I
mean
that
I
be
a
 
that
I

not
indifferent

I
mean

I

<EOS>
"
you

Lord
George
haughtily

<EOS>
"
there
be
no

I
:

I
tell
you
I
do
not

to

this
I
know

that
there

in

not

Lord

<EOS>
"
You
be
forty
year
young

I
be
in
experience

<EOS>
I
have
pass
through
every
grade
of
life
.
<EOS>
with
my
own
skill
and
dare
I
have
make
my

fortune

I
have
be
in
fourteen
pitch
battle

have
be
twenty

three
time
on

ground

never

touch
but
once
;

that
be
by
the
sword
of
a

maitre

whom
I
kill

I
start
in
life
at
seventeen
,
a
beggar
,

be
now
at
seven

-
twenty
,
with
twenty
thousand
guinea

do
you
suppose
a

of
my
courage

energy
can
not
attain
anything
that
he
dare
,
and
that
have
claim
upon

widow

I
will
not
press
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
this
speech
be
not
exactly
true
to
the
letter
(
for
I
have
multiply
my
pitch
battle
,
my
duel
,
and
my
wealth
somewhat
)
;
but
I
see
that
it
make
the
impression
I
desire
to
effect
upon
the
young
gentleman
's
mind
,
who
listen
to
my
statement
with
peculiar
seriousness
,
and
whom
I
presently
leave
to
digest
it
.
  
<EOS>
a
couple
of
day
afterwards
I
call
to
see
him
again
,
when
I
bring
with
me
some
of
the
letter
that
have
pass
between
me
and
my
Lady
Lyndon

here

I

I
show
it
you
in
confidence

be
a
lock
of

evening
grey

I
could
not
help
laugh
as
he
make
the
quotation
.
<EOS>
They
be
,
in
fact
,
the
very
word
my
Calista
have
address
to
me
.

we
find

upon
compare

,
that
whole
passage
of
eloquence
figure
in

one
correspondence

appear
in
the
other

see
what
it
be
to
be
a
blue

stocking
and
have
a
love
of
letter

writing

<EOS>
the
young
man
put
down
the
paper
in
great
perturbation
.
<EOS>
"
well

thank
Heaven
!
"
<EOS>
say
he
,
after
a
pause
of
some
duration
,
 
"
thank
Heaven

a
good
riddance

ah

Mr.

,
what
a
woman
I
may
have

these
lucky
paper
not
come
in

<EOS>
I
think
my
Lady
Lyndon
have
a
heart
,
sir
,
I
must
confess
,
though
not
a
very
warm
one
;
and
that
,
at
least
,
one
could
trust
her
.
<EOS>
but
marry
her
now
!
<EOS>
I
would
as
lief
send
my
servant
into
the
street
to
get
me
a
wife

as
put
up

such
an
ephesian
matron
as
that

<EOS>
"
My
Lord
George

say
I
,
"
you
little
know

remember
what

side

should
be
indifferent

I
will
dare
to
wager

ever

beyond

harmless
gallantry

heartless
vixen

"
  
<EOS>
the
wound
young
nobleman
be
either
,
as
I
have
say
,
very
young
and
green
in
matter
of
the
world
 
for
to
suppose
that
a
man
would
give
up
forty
thousand
a
year
,
because
,
forsooth
,
the
lady
connect
with
it
have
write
a
few
sentimental
letter
to
a
young
fellow
,
be
too
absurd
 
<EOS>
or
,
as
I
be
incline
to
believe
,
he
be
glad
of
an
excuse
to
quit
the
field
altogether
,
be
by
no
mean
anxious
to
meet
the
victorious
sword
of
Redmond
Barry
a
second
time

<EOS>
when
the
idea
of
Poynings
'
danger
,
or
the
reproach
probably
address
by
him
to
the
widow
regard
myself
,
have
bring
this
exceedingly
weak
and
feeble
woman
up
to
Dublin
,
as
I
expect
,
and
my
worthy
Ulick
have
inform
me
of
her
arrival
,
I
quit
my
good
mother
,
who
be
quite
reconcile
to
me
(
indeed
the
duel
have
do
that
)
,
and
find
the
disconsolate
Calista
be
in
the
habit
of
pay
visit
to
the
wounded
swain
;
much
to
the
annoyance
,
the
servant
tell
me
,
of
that
gentleman
.
<EOS>
the
English
be
often
absurdly
high
and
haughty
upon
a
point
of
punctilio
;
and
,
after
his
kinswoman
's
conduct
,
Lord
Poynings
swear
he
would
have
no
more
to
do
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
this
information
from
his
lordship
's
gentleman
;
with
whom
,
as
I
have
say
,
I
take
particular
care
to
be
friend

I
deny
admission
by
his
porter

call

have
most
likely
bribe

I
have
;

have
find
her
way
up

deny
admission

I
have
watch
her
from

practice

letter

opening
in
private
life

except
in
case
of
the
most
urgent
necessity
:
when
we
must
follow
the
example
of
our
better

the
statesman
of

Europe

<EOS>
My
Lady
Lyndon
's
letter
be
none
the
bad
for
be
open
,
and
a
great
deal
the
well
;
the
knowledge
obtain
from
the
perusal
of
some
of
her
multifarious
epistle
enable
me
to
become
intimate
with
her
character
in
a
hundred
way
,
and
obtain
a
power
over
her
by
which
I
be
not
slow
to
profit
.
<EOS>
by
the
aid
of
the
letter
and
of
my
english
friend
,
whom
I
always
regale
with
the
good
of
liquor
,
and
satisfy
with
present
of
money
still
more
agreeable
(
I
use
to
put
on
a
livery
in
order
to
meet
him
,
and
a
red
wig
,
in
which
it
be
impossible
to
know
the
dashing
and
elegant
Redmond
Barry
)
,
I
get
such
an
insight
into
the
widow
's
movement
as
astonish
her
.
<EOS>
I
know
beforehand
to
what
public
place
she
would
go
;
they
be
,
on
account
of
her
widowhood
,
but
few
:
<EOS>
and
wherever
she
appear
,
at
church
or
in
the
park
,
I
be
always
ready
to
offer
her
her
book
,
or
to
canter
on
horseback
by
the
side
of
her
chariot
.
  
<EOS>
many
of
her
Ladyship
's
letter
be
the
most
whimsical
rodomontade
that
ever
blue
-
stocking
pen
.
<EOS>
She
be
a
woman
who
take
up
and
throw
off
a
great
number
of
dear
friend
than
any
one
I
ever
know
.
<EOS>
to
some
of
these
female
darling
she
begin
presently
to
write
about
my
unworthy
self
,
and
it
be
with
a
sentiment
of
extreme
satisfaction
I
find
at
length
that
the
widow
be
grow
dreadfully
afraid
of
me
;
call
me
her
bete
noire
,
her
dark
spirit
,
her
murderous
adorer
,
and
a
thousand
other
name
indicative
of
her
extreme
disquietude
and
terror
.
<EOS>
It
be
:
"
the
wretch
have
be
dog
my
chariot
through
the
park
,
"
or
,
"
my
fate
pursue
me
at
church
,
"
and
"
my
inevitable
adorer
hand
me
out
of
my
chair
at
the
mercer
's
,
"
or
what
not
.
<EOS>
My
wish
be
to
increase
this
sentiment
of
awe
in
her
bosom
,
and
to
make
her
believe
that
I
be
a
person
from
whom
escape
be
impossible
.
  
<EOS>
to
this
end
I
bribe
a
fortune
-
teller
,
whom
she
consult
along
with
a
number
of
the
most
foolish
and
distinguished
people
of
Dublin
,
in
those
day
;
and
who
,
although
she
go
dressed
like
one
of
her
waiting
-
woman
,
do
not
fail
to
recognise
her
real
rank
,
and
to
describe
as
her
future
husband
her
persevere
adorer
Redmond
Barry
,
Esquire

very
much
.
<EOS>
She
write
about
it
in
term
of
great
wonder
and
terror
to
her
female
correspondent
.
"
<EOS>
Can
this
monster
,
"
she
write
,
"
indeed
do
as
he
boast
,
and
bend
even
Fate
to
his
will
?
 
<EOS>
can
he
make
me
marry
him
though
I
cordially
detest
him
,
and
bring
me
a
slave
to
his
foot
.
<EOS>
the
horrid
look
of
his
black
serpent
-
like
eye
fascinate
and
frighten
me
:
it
seem
to
follow
me
everywhere
,
and
even
when
I
close
my
own
eye
,
the
dreadful
gaze
penetrate
the
lid
,
and
be
still
upon
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
when
a
woman
begin
to
talk
of
a
man
in
this
way
,
he
be
an
ass
who
do
not
win
her
;
and
,
for
my
part
,
I
use
to
follow
her
about
,
and
put
myself
in
an
attitude
opposite
her
,
"
and
fascinate
her
with
my
glance
,
"
as
she
say
,
most
assiduously
.
<EOS>
Lord
George
Poynings
,
her
former
admirer
,
be
meanwhile
keep
his
room
with
his
wound
,
and
seem
determined
to
give
up
all
claim
to
her
favour
;
for
he
deny
her
admittance
when
she
call
,
send
no
answer
to
her
multiplied
correspondence
,
and
content
himself
by
say
generally
,
that
the
surgeon
have
forbid
him
to
receive
visitor
or
to
answer
letter
.
<EOS>
thus
,
while
he
go
into
the
background
,
I
come
forward
,
and
take
good
care
that
no
other
rival
should
present
themselves
with
any
chance
of
success
;
for
,
as
soon
as
I
hear
of
one
,
I
have
a
quarrel
fasten
on
him
,
and
,
in
this
way
,
pink
two
more
,
besides
my
first
victim
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
I
always
take
another
pretext
for
quarrel
with
them
than
the
real
one
of
attention
to
Lady
Lyndon
,
so
that
no
scandal
or
hurt
to
her
Ladyship
's
feeling
may
arise
in
consequence
;
but
she
very
well
know
what
be
the
meaning
of
these
duel
;
and
the
young
fellow
of
Dublin
,
too
,
by
lay
two
and
two
together
,
begin
to
perceive
that
there
be
a
certain
dragon
in
watch
for
the
wealthy
heiress
,
and
that
the
dragon
must
be
subdue
first
before
they
could
get
at
the
lady
.
<EOS>
I
warrant
that
,
after
the
first
three
,
not
many
champion
be
find
to
address
the
lady
;
and
have
often
laugh
(
in
my
sleeve
)
to
see
many
of
the
young
Dublin
beaux
ride
by
the
side
of
her
carriage
scamper
off
as
soon
as
my
bay
-
mare
and
green
livery
make
their
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
I
want
to
impress
her
with
some
great
and
awful
instance
of
my
power
,
and
to
this
end
have
determine
to
confer
a
great
benefit
upon
my
honest
cousin
Ulick
,
and
carry
off
for
him
the
fair
object
of
his
affection
,
Miss
Kiljoy
,
under
the
very
eye
of
her
guardian
and
friend
,
Lady
Lyndon
;
and
in
the
tooth
of
the
squire
,
the
young
lady
's
brother
,
who
pass
the
season
at
Dublin
,
and
make
as
much
swagger
and
to
-
do
about
their
sister
's
L10,000
Irish
,
as
if
she
have
have
a
plum
to
her
fortune
.
<EOS>
the
girl
be
by
no
means
averse
to
Mr.
Brady
;
and
it
only
show
how
faint
-
spirit
some
man
be
,
and
how
a
superior
genius
can
instantly
overcome
difficulty
which
to
common
mind
seem
insuperable
,
that
he
never
have
think
of
run
off
with
her
:
as
I
at
once
and
boldly
do
.
<EOS>
Miss
Kiljoy
have
be
a
ward
in
Chancery
until
she
attain
her
majority
<EOS>
(
before
which
period
it
would
have
be
a
dangerous
matter
for
me
to
put
in
execution
the
scheme
I
meditate
concern
her
)
;
but
,
though
now
free
to
marry
whom
she
like
,
she
be
a
young
lady
of
timid
disposition
,
and
as
much
under
fear
of
her
brother
and
relative
as
though
she
have
not
be
independent
of
them
.
<EOS>
They
have
some
friend
of
their
own
in
view
for
the
young
lady
,
and
have
scornfully
reject
the
proposal
of
Ulick
Brady
,
the
ruin
gentleman
;
who
be
quite
unworthy
,
as
these
rustic
buck
think
,
of
the
hand
of
such
a
prodigiously
wealthy
heiress
as
their
sister
.
  
<EOS>
find
herself
lonely
in
her
great
house
in
Dublin
,
the
Countess
of
Lyndon
invite
her
friend
Miss
Amelia
to
pass
the
season
with
her
at
Dublin
;
and
,
in
a
fit
of
maternal
fondness
,
also
send
for
her
son
the
little
Bullingdon
,
and
my
old
acquaintance
his
governor
,
to
come
to
the
capital
and
bear
her
company
.
<EOS>
a
family
coach
bring
the
boy
,
the
heiress
,
and
the
tutor
from
Castle
Lyndon
;
and
I
determine
to
take
the
first
opportunity
of
put
my
plan
in
execution
.
  
<EOS>
for
this
chance
I
have
not
very
long
to
wait
.
<EOS>
I
have
say
,
in
a
former
chapter
of
my
biography
,
that
the
kingdom
of
Ireland
be
at
this
period
ravage
by
various
party
of
bandit
;
who
,
under
the
name
of
Whiteboys
,
Oakboys
,
Steelboys
,
with
captain
at
their
head
,
kill
proctor
,
fire
stack
,
houghe
and
maim
cattle
,
and
take
the
law
into
their
own
hand
.
<EOS>
one
of
these
band
,
or
several
of
them
for
what
I
know
,
be
command
by
a
mysterious
personage
call
Captain
Thunder
;
whose
business
seem
to
be
that
of
marry
people
with
or
without
their
own
consent
,
or
that
of
their
parent
.
<EOS>
the
Dublin
Gazettes
and
Mercuries
of
that
period
(
the
year
1772
)
teem
with
proclamation
from
the
Lord
Lieutenant
,
offer
reward
for
the
apprehension
of
this
dreadful
Captain
Thunder
and
his
gang
,
and
describe
at
length
various
exploit
of
the
savage
aide
-
de
-
camp
of
Hymen
.
<EOS>
I
determine
to
make
use
,
if
not
of
the
service
,
at
any
rate
of
the
name
of
Captain
Thunder
,
and
put
my
cousin
Ulick
in
possession
of
his
lady
and
her
ten
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
She
be
no
great
beauty
,
and
,
I
presume
,
it
be
the
money
he
love
rather
than
the
owner
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
on
account
of
her
widowhood
,
Lady
Lyndon
could
not
as
yet
frequent
the
ball
and
rout
which
the
hospitable
nobility
of
Dublin
be
in
the
custom
of
giving
;
but
her
friend
Miss
Kiljoy
have
no
such
cause
for
retirement
,
and
be
glad
to
attend
any
party
to
which
she
may
be
invite
.
<EOS>
I
make
Ulick
Brady
a
present
of
a
couple
of
handsome
suit
of
velvet
,
and
by
my
influence
procure
him
an
invitation
to
many
of
the
most
elegant
of
these
assembly
.
<EOS>
but
he
have
not
have
my
advantage
or
experience
of
the
manner
of
Court
;
be
as
shy
with
lady
as
a
young
colt
,
and
could
no
more
dance
a
minuet
than
a
donkey
.
<EOS>
He
make
very
little
way
in
the
polite
world
or
in
his
mistress
's
heart
:
in
fact
,
I
could
see
that
she
prefer
several
other
young
gentleman
to
him
,
who
be
more
at
home
in
the
ball
-
room
than
poor
Ulick
;
he
have
make
his
first
impression
upon
the
heiress
,
and
feel
his
first
flame
for
her
,
in
her
father
's
house
of
Ballykiljoy
,
where
he
use
to
hunt
and
get
drunk
with
the
old
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
do
THIM
two
<EOS>
well
enough
,
anyhow
,
"
Ulick
would
say
,
heave
a
sigh
;
"
and
if
it
be
drink
or
ride
across
country
would
do
it
<EOS>
,
there
be
no
man
in
Ireland
would
have
a
well
chance
with
Amalia
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
never
fear
,
Ulick
,
"
be
my
reply
;
"
you
shall
have
your
Amalia
,
or
my
name
be
not
Redmond
Barry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
Lord
Charlemont
 
who
be
one
of
the
most
elegant
and
accomplished
nobleman
in
Ireland
in
those
day
,
a
fine
scholar
and
wit
,
a
gentleman
who
have
travel
much
abroad
,
where
I
have
the
honour
of
know
him
 
give
a
magnificent
masquerade
at
his
house
of
Marino
,
some
few
mile
from
Dublin
,
on
the
Dunleary
road
.
<EOS>
and
it
be
at
this
entertainment
that
I
be
determine
that
Ulick
should
be
make
happy
for
life
.
<EOS>
Miss
Kiljoy
be
invite
to
the
masquerade
,
and
the
little
Lord
Bullingdon
,
who
long
to
witness
such
a
scene
;
and
it
be
agree
that
he
be
to
go
under
the
guardianship
of
his
governor
,
<EOS>
my
old
friend
the
Reverend
Mr.
Runt
.
<EOS>
I
learn
what
be
the
equipage
in
which
the
party
be
to
be
convey
to
the
ball
,
and
take
my
measure
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
Ulick
Brady
be
not
present
:
his
fortune
and
quality
be
not
sufficient
to
procure
him
an
invitation
to
so
distinguished
a
place
,
and
I
have
it
give
out
three
day
previous
that
he
have
be
arrest
for
debt
:
<EOS>
a
rumour
which
surprise
nobody
who
know
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
appear
that
night
in
a
character
with
which
I
be
very
familiar
,
that
of
a
private
soldier
in
the
King
of
Prussia
's
guard
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
grotesque
mask
make
,
with
an
immense
nose
and
moustache
,
talk
a
jumble
of
broken
English
and
German
,
in
which
the
latter
greatly
predominate
;
and
have
crowd
round
me
laugh
at
my
droll
accent
,
and
whose
curiosity
be
increase
by
a
knowledge
of
my
previous
history
.
<EOS>
Miss
Kiljoy
be
attire
as
an
antique
princess
,
with
little
Bullingdon
as
a
page
of
the
time
of
chivalry
;
his
hair
be
in
powder
,
his
doublet
rise
-
colour
,
and
pea
-
green
and
silver
,
and
he
look
very
handsome
and
saucy
as
he
strut
about
with
my
sword
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
as
for
Mr.
Runt
,
he
walk
about
very
demurely
in
a
domino
,
and
perpetually
pay
his
respect
to
the
buffet
,
and
eat
enough
cold
chicken
and
drink
enough
punch
and
champagne
to
satisfy
a
company
of
grenadier
.
  
<EOS>
the
Lord
Lieutenant
come
and
go
in
state
-
the
ball
be
magnificent
.
<EOS>
Miss
Kiljoy
have
partner
in
plenty
,
among
whom
be
myself
,
who
walk
a
minuet
with
her
(
if
the
clumsy
waddling
of
the
irish
heiress
may
be
call
by
such
a
name
)
;
and
I
take
occasion
to
plead
my
passion
for
Lady
Lyndon
in
the
most
pathetic
term
,
and
to
beg
her
friend
's
interference
in
my
favour
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
three
hour
past
midnight
when
the
party
for
Lyndon
House
go
away
.
<EOS>
Little
Bullingdon
have
long
since
be
asleep
in
one
of
Lady
Charlemont
's
china
closet
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Runt
be
exceedingly
husky
in
talk
,
and
unsteady
in
gait
.
<EOS>
a
young
lady
of
the
present
day
would
be
alarm
to
see
a
gentleman
in
such
a
condition
;
but
it
be
a
common
sight
in
those
jolly
old
time
,
when
a
gentleman
be
think
a
milksop
unless
he
be
occasionally
tipsy
.
<EOS>
I
see
Miss
Kiljoy
to
her
carriage
,
with
several
other
gentleman
:
and
,
peer
through
the
crowd
of
ragged
linkboy
,
driver
,
beggar
,
drunken
man
and
woman
,
who
use
invariably
to
wait
round
great
man
's
door
when
festivity
be
go
on
,
see
the
carriage
drive
off
,
with
a
hurrah
from
the
mob
;
then
come
back
presently
to
the
supper
-
room
,
where
I
talk
German
,
favour
the
three
or
four
toper
still
there
with
a
high
-
dutch
chorus
,
and
attack
the
dish
and
wine
with
great
resolution
.
  
<EOS>
"
how
can
you
drink
aisy
with
that
big
nose
on
?
"
say
one
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
"
go
an
be
hangt
!
"
say
I
,
in
the
true
accent
,
apply
myself
again
to
the
wine
;
with
which
the
other
laugh
,
and
I
pursue
my
supper
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
gentleman
present
who
have
see
the
Lyndon
party
go
off
,
with
whom
I
have
make
a
bet
,
which
I
lose
;
and
the
next
morning
I
call
upon
him
and
pay
it
him
.
<EOS>
all
which
particular
the
reader
will
be
surprised
at
hear
enumerate
;
but
the
fact
be
,
that
it
be
not
I
who
go
back
to

party

my
late
german
valet

who
be
of
my

dress
in

could
perfectly
pass

as
the
footboard
there
be
cover
with
spike
,
as
a
defence
against
the

boy

who
love
a

Thady

fidelity
would
not
induce
him
to
brave
these

he
be
persuade
to
remain
by
the
wound
chariot
,
for
which
he
and
the
coachman
manufacture
a
linch

pin
out
of
a
neighbouring
hedge

<EOS>
meanwhile
,
although
the
hackney

coachman
drive
on
rapidly
,
yet
the
party
within
seem
to
consider
it
be
a
long
distance
from
Dublin
;
and
what
be
Miss
Kiljoy
's
astonishment
,
on
look
out
of
the
window
at
length
,
to
see
around
her
a
lonely
heath
,
with
no
sign
of
building
or
city
.
<EOS>
She
begin
forthwith
to
scream
out
to
the
coachman
to
stop
;
but
the
man
only
whip
the
horse
the
faster
for
her
noise
,
and
bade
her
Ladyship
"

<EOS>
Miss
Kiljoy
continue
scream
,
the
coachman
flogging
,
the
horse
gallop
,
until
two
or
three
man
appear
suddenly
from
a
hedge
,
to
whom
the
fair
one
cry
for
assistance
;
and
the
young
Bullingdon
open
the
coach
-
door
,
jump
valiantly
out
,
topple
over
head
and
heel
as
he
fall
;
but
jump
up
in
an
instant
,
he
draw
his
little
sword
,
and
,
run
towards
the
carriage
,
exclaim
,
"
this
way
,
gentleman
!
<EOS>
stop
the
rascal
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
stop
!
"
cry
the
man
;
at
which
the
coachman
pull
up
with
extraordinary
obedience
.
<EOS>
runt
all
the
while
lie
tipsy
in
the
carriage
,
have
only
a
dreamy
half
-
consciousness
of
all
that
be
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
the
newly
arrive
champion
of
female
distress
now
hold
a
consultation
,
in
which
they
look
at
the
young
lord
and
laugh
considerably
.
  
<EOS>
"
do
not
be
alarm
,
"
say
the
leader
,
come
up
to
the
door
;
"
one
of
my
people
shall
mount
the
box
by
the
side
of
that
treacherous
rascal

and
,
with
your

's
leave
,
I
and
my

will
get
in
and
see
you
home
.
<EOS>
We
be
well
armed
,
and
can
defend
you
in
case
of
danger
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
this
,
and
without
more
ado
,
he
jump
into
the
carriage
,
his
companion
follow
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
know
your
place
,
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
cry
out
little
Bullingdon
indignantly
:
"
and
give
place
to
the
Lord
Viscount
Bullingdon
!
"
and
put
himself
before
the
huge
person
of
the
new
-
comer
,
who
be
about
to
enter
the
hackney
-
coach
.
  
<EOS>
"
get
out
of
that
,
my
Lord
,
"
say
the
man
,
in
a
broad
brogue
,
and
shove
him
aside
.
<EOS>
on
which
the
boy
,
cry
"
thief
!
<EOS>
thief
!
<EOS>
"
draw
out
his
little
hanger
,
and
run
at
the
man
,
and
would
have
wound
him
(
for
a
small
sword
will
wound
as
well
as
a
great
one
)
;
but
his
opponent
,
who
be
arm
with
a
long
stick
,
strike
the
weapon
luckily
out
of
the
lad
's
hand
:
it
go
fly
over
his
head
,
and
leave
him
aghast
and
mortify
at
his
discomfiture
.
  
<EOS>
He
then
pull
off
his
hat
,
make
his
lordship
a
low
bow
,
and
enter
the
carriage
;
the
door
of
which
be
shut
upon
him
by
his
confederate
,
who
be
to
mount
the
box
.
<EOS>
Miss
Kiljoy
may
have
scream
;
but
I
presume
her
shriek
be
stop
by
the
sight
of
an
enormous
horse
-
pistol
which
one
of
her
champion
produce
,
who
say
,
"
no
harm
be
intend
you
,
madam
,
<EOS>
but
if
you
cry
out
,
we
must
gag
you
;
"
on
which
she
suddenly
become
as
mute
as
a
fish
.
  
<EOS>
all
these
event
take
place
in
an
exceedingly
short
space
of
time
;
and
when
the
three
invader
have
take
possession
of
the
carriage
,
the
poor
little
Bullingdon
be
leave
bewilder
and
astonish
on
the
heath
,
one
of
them
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
,
say
,
    
"
My
Lord
,
a
word
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
what
be
it
?
"
say
the
boy
,
begin
to
whimper
<EOS>
:
he
be
but
eleven
year
old
,
and
his
courage
have
be
excellent
hitherto
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
be
only
two
mile
from
Marino
.
<EOS>
walk
back
till
you
come
to
a
big
stone
,
there
turn
to
the
right
,
and
keep
on
straight
till
you
get
to
the
high
-
road
,
when
you
will
easily
find
your
way
back
.
<EOS>
and
when
you
see
her
ladyship
your
mamma
,
give
CAPTAIN
THUNDER
's
compliment
,
and
say
Miss
Amelia
Kiljoy
be
go
to
be
marry
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
o
heaven
!
"
sigh
out
that
young
lady
.
  
<EOS>
the
carriage
drive
swiftly
on
,
and
the
poor
little
nobleman
be
leave
alone
on
the
heath
,
just
as
the
morning
begin
to
break
.
<EOS>
He
be
fairly
frightened
;
and
no
wonder
.
<EOS>
He
think
of
run
after
the
coach
;
but
his
courage
and
his
little
leg
fail
him
:
so
he
sit
down
upon
a
stone
and
cry
for
vexation
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
this
way
that
Ulick
Brady
make
what
I
call
a
sabine
marriage
.
<EOS>
when
he
halt
with
his
two
groomsman
at
the
cottage
where
the
ceremony
be
to
be
perform
,
Mr.
Runt
,
the
chaplain
,
at
first
decline
to
perform
it
.
<EOS>
but
a
pistol
be
hold
at
the
head
of
that
unfortunate
preceptor
,
and
he
be
tell
,
with
dreadful
oath
,
that
his
miserable
brain
would
be
blow
out
;
when
he
consent
to
read
the
service
.
<EOS>
the
lovely
Amelia
have
,
very
likely
,
a
similar
inducement
hold
out
to
her
,
but
of
that
I
know
nothing
;
for
I
drive
back
to
town
with
the
coachman
as
soon
as
we
have
set
the
bridal
party
down
,
and
have
the
satisfaction
of
find
Fritz
,
my
German
,
arrive
before
me
:
he
have
come
back
in
my
carriage
in
my
dress
,
have
leave
the
masquerade
undiscovered
,
and
do
everything
there
accord
to
my
order
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Runt
come
back
the
next
day
in
a
piteous
plight
,
keep
silence
as
to
his
share
in
the
occurrence
of
the
evening
,
and
with
a
dismal
story
of
have
be
drunk
,
of
have
be
waylay
and
bind
,
of
have
be
leave
on
the
road
and
pick
up
by
a
Wicklow
cart
,
which
be
come
in
with
provision
to
Dublin
,
and
find
him
helpless
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
possible
mean
of
fix
any
share
of
the
conspiracy
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Little
Bullingdon
,
who
,
too
,
find
his
way
home
,
be
unable
in
any
way
to
identify
me
.
<EOS>
but
Lady
Lyndon
know
that
I
be
concern
in
the
plot
,
for
I
meet
her
hurry
the
next
day
to
the
Castle
;
all
the
town
be
up
about
the
enlevement
.
<EOS>
and
I
salute
her
with
a
smile
so
diabolical
,
that
I
know
she
be
aware
that
I
have
be
concern
in
the
daring
and
ingenious
scheme
.
  
<EOS>
thus
it
be
that
I
repay
Ulick
Brady
's
kindness
to
me
in
early
day
;
and
have
the
satisfaction
of
restore
the
fall
fortune
of
a
deserving
branch
of
my
family
.
<EOS>
He
take
his
bride
into
Wicklow
,
where
he
live
with
her
in
the
strict
seclusion
until
the
affair
be
blow
over
;
the
Kiljoys
strive
everywhere
in
vain
to
discover
his
retreat
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
for
a
while
even
know
who
be
the
lucky
man
who
have
carry
off
the
heiress
;
nor
be
it
until
she
write
a
letter
some
week
afterwards
,
sign
Amelia
Brady
,
and
express
perfect
happiness
in
her
new
condition
,
and
state
that
she
have
be
marry
by
Lady
Lyndon
's
chaplain
Mr.
Runt
,
that
the
truth
be
know
,
and
my
worthy
friend
confess
his
share
of
the
transaction
.
<EOS>
as
his
good
-
natured
mistress
do
not
dismiss
him
from
his
post
in
consequence
,
everybody
persist
in
supposing
that
poor
Lady
Lyndon
be
privy
to
the
plot
;
and
the
story
of
her
Ladyship
's
passionate
attachment
for
me
gain
more
and
more
credit
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
not
slow
,
you
may
be
sure
,
in
profit
by
these
rumour
.
<EOS>
every
one
think
I
have
a
share
in
the
Brady
marriage
;
though
no
one
could
prove
it
.
<EOS>
every
one
think
I
be
well
with
the
widow
Countess
;
though
no
one
could
show
that
I
say
so
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
a
way
of
prove
a
thing
even
while
you
contradict
it
,
and
I
use
to
laugh
and
joke
<EOS>
so
apropos
that
all
man
begin
to
wish
me
joy
of
my
great
fortune
,
and
look
up
to
me
as
the
affiance
husband
of
the
great
heiress
in
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
the
paper
take
up
the
matter
;
the
female
friend
of
Lady
Lyndon
remonstrate
with
her
and
cry
"
Fie
!
"
<EOS>
even
the
english
journal
and
magazine
,
which
in
those
day
be
very
scandalous
,
talk
of
the
matter
;
and
whisper
that
a
beautiful
and
accomplished
widow
,
with
a
title
and
the
large
possession
in

<EOS>
Lady

so
perplex

terrify
by
this
continual

that
she

<EOS>
Your

and

to

the
Dublin

announce
mine

<EOS>
there
be
not

but
think
she

follow
me
to
England
;
whereas
she
be
only
fly

<EOS>
Vain
hope
!
 
<EOS>
a

of
my
resolution
be
not
thus

be
balk
in
pursuit

<EOS>
have
she
flee
to
the
antipode
,
I
would
have
be
there
:
ay

and
would
have
follow
her
as
far
as
Orpheus

Eurydice

<EOS>
Her
ladyship
have
a
house
in
Berkeley
Square
,
London
,
more
splendid
than
that
which
she
possess
in
Dublin
;
and
,
know
that
she
would
come
thither
<EOS>
,
I
precede
her
to
the
english
capital
,
and
take
handsome
apartment
in
Hill
Street
,
hard
by
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
same
intelligence
in
her
London
house
which
I
have
procure
in
Dublin
.
<EOS>
the
same
faithful
porter
be
there
to
give
me
all
the
information
I
require
.
<EOS>
I
promise
to
treble
his
wage
as
soon
as
a
certain
event
should
happen
.
<EOS>
I
win
over
Lady
Lyndon
's
companion
by
a
present
of
a
hundred
guinea
down
,
and
a
promise
of
two
thousand
when
I
should
be
married
,
and
gain
the
favour
of
her
favourite
lady'
-
maid
by
a
bribe
of
similar
magnitude
.
<EOS>
My
reputation
have
so
far
precede
me
in
London
that
,
on
my
arrival
,
number
of
the
genteel
be
eager
to
receive
me
at
their
rout
.
<EOS>
We
have
no
idea
in
this
humdrum
age
what
a
gay
and
splendid
place
London
be
then
:
what
a
passion
for
play
there
be
among
young
and
old
,
male
and
female
;
<EOS>
what
thousand
be
lose
and
win
in
a

;
what
beauty
there
be
 
how
brilliant
,
gay
,
and
dashing
!
<EOS>
everybody
be
delightfully
wicked
:
the
Royal
Dukes
of
Gloucester

Cumberland
set
the
example
;
the
noble
follow
close

<EOS>
run
away
be

<EOS>
ah

<EOS>
it
be
a
pleasant
time
;
and
lucky
be
he
who
have
fire
,
and
youth
,
and
money
,
and
could
live
in
it

<EOS>
I
have
all
these
;

the
old
frequenter
of
"
White
's
,
"
"
Wattier
's
,
"
and
"
Goosetree

"
could
tell
story
of
the
gallantry
,
spirit
,
and
high
fashion
of
Captain
Barry
.
  
<EOS>
the
progress
of
a
love
-
story
be
tedious
to
all
those
who
be
not
concerned
,
and
I
leave
such
theme
to
the
hack
novel
-
writer
,
and
the
young
boarding
-
school
miss
for
whom
they
write
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
my
intention
to
follow
,
step
by
step
,
the
incident
of
my
courtship
,
or
to
narrate
all
the
difficulty
I
have
to
contend
with
,
and
my
triumphant
manner
of
surmount
them
.
<EOS>
suffice
it
to
say
,
I
do
overcome
these
difficulty
.
<EOS>
I
be
of
opinion
,
with
my
friend
the
late
ingenious
Mr.
Wilkes
,
that
such
impediment
be
nothing
in
the
way
of
a
man
of
spirit
;
and
that
he
can
convert
indifference
and
aversion
into
love
,
if
he
have
perseverance
and
cleverness
sufficient
.
<EOS>
by
the
time
the
Countess
's
widowhood
be
expire
,
I
have
find
mean
to
be
receive
into
her
house
;
I
have
her
woman
perpetually
talk
in
my
favour
,
vaunt
my
power
,
expatiate
upon
my
reputation
,
and
boasting
of
my
success
and
popularity
in
the
fashionable
world
.
  
<EOS>
also
,
the
good
friend
I
have
in
the
prosecution
of
my
tender
suit
be
the
Countess
's
noble
relative
;
who
be
far
from
know
the
service
that
they
do
me
,
and
to
whom
I
beg
leave
to
tender
my
heartfelt
thank
for
the
abuse
with
which
they
then
load
me
!
<EOS>
and
to
whom
I
fling
my
utter
contempt
for
the
calumny
and
hatred
with
which
they
have
subsequently
pursue
me
.
  
<EOS>
the
chief
of
these
amiable
person
be
the
Marchioness
of
Tiptoff
,
mother
of
the
young
gentleman
whose
audacity
I
have
punish
at
Dublin
.
<EOS>
this
old
harridan
,
on
the
Countess
's
first
arrival
in
London
,
wait
upon
her
,
and
favour
her
with
such
a
storm
of
abuse
for
her
encouragement
of
me
,
that
I
do
believe
she
advance
my
cause
<EOS>
more
than
six
month
'
courtship
could
have
do
,
or
the
pinking
of
a
half
-
dozen
of
rival

It
be
in
vain
that
poor
Lady
Lyndon
plead
her
entire
innocence
and
vow
she
have
never
encourage
me
.
"
<EOS>
never
encourage
him
!
"
<EOS>
scream
out
the
old
fury
;
"
do
not
you
encourage
the
wretch
at
Spa
,
during
Sir
Charles
's
own
life
?
<EOS>
do
not
you
marry
a
dependant
of
yours
to
one
of
this
profligate
's
bankrupt
cousin
?
<EOS>
when
he
set
off
for
England
,
do
not
you
follow
him
like
a
mad
woman
the

he
take
lodging
at
your

door
almost

you
call
this
no

for
shame

madam

shame
!
<EOS>
You
may
have
marry
my
son
 
my
dear
and
noble
George

but
that
he
do
not
choose
to
interfere
with
your
shameful
passion
for
the
beggarly
upstart
whom
you
cause
to
assassinate
him
;
and
the
only
counsel
I
have
to
give
your
ladyship
be
this
,
to
legitimatise
the
tie
which
you
have
contract
with
this
shameless
adventurer
;
to
make
that
connection
legal
which
,
real
as
it
be
now
,
be
against
both
decency
and
religion
;
and
to
spare
your
family
and
your
son
the
shame
of
your
present
line
of
life
.
"
  
<EOS>
with
this
the
old
fury
of
a
marchioness
leave
the
room
,
and
Lady
Lyndon
in
tear
:
I
have
the
whole
particular
of
the
conversation
from
her
Ladyship
's
companion
,
and
augur
the
good
result
from
it
in
my
favour
.
  
<EOS>
thus
,
by
the
sage
influence
of
my
Lady
Tiptoff
,
the
Countess
of
Lyndon
's
natural
friend
and
family
be
keep
from
her
society
.
<EOS>
even
when
Lady
Lyndon
go
to
Court
the
most
august
lady
in
the
realm
receive
her
with
such
marked
coldness
,
that
the
unfortunate
widow
come
home
and
take
to
her
bed
with
vexation
.
<EOS>
and
thus
I
may
say
that
Royalty
itself
become
an
agent
in
advance
my
suit
,
and
help
the
plan
of
the
poor
irish
soldier
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
so
it
be
that
Fate
work
with
agent
,
great
and
small
;
and
by
mean
over
which
they
have
no
control
the
destiny
of
man
and
woman
be
accomplish
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
always
consider
the
conduct
of
Mrs.
Bridget
(
Lady
Lyndon
's
favourite
maid
at
this
juncture
)
as
a
masterpiece
of
ingenuity
:
and
,
indeed
,
have
such
an
opinion
of
her
diplomatic
skill
,
that
the
very
instant
I
become
master
of
the
Lyndon
estate
,
and
pay
her
the
promised
sum
 
<EOS>
I
be
a
man
of
honour
,
and
rather
than
not
keep
my
word
with
the
woman
<EOS>
,
I
raise
the
money
of
the
Jews
,
at
an
exorbitant
interest
 
as
soon
,
I
say
,
as
I
achieve
my
triumph
,
I
take
Mrs.
Bridget
by
the
hand
,
and
say
,
"
Madam
,
you
have
show
such
unexampled
fidelity
in
my
service
that
I
be
glad
to
reward
you
,
accord
to
my
promise
;
but
you
have
give
proof
of
such
extraordinary
cleverness
and
dissimulation
,
that
I
must
decline
keep
you
in
Lady
Lyndon
's
establishment
,
and
beg
you
will
leave
it
this
very
day

over

I
must
tell
you
what
she

be
so
clever

<EOS>
why
,
it
be
the
simple
thing
in

<EOS>
when
Lady
Lyndon
lament
her
fate

my
 
as
she
be
pleased
to
call
it
 
shameful
treatment
of
her

Mrs.

my

elegant

I

no

Mr.

of

to
the
fact

her

my

My

me
where
I
should
meet
Lady

accordingly
I
follow

find
her
at
the
Pantheon

set

visit
our

in
the
West

where
I

never

and
henceforward
assume
the
style

title
of
BARRY
LYNDON
,
as
I
have
write
it
in
this
autobiography
.
   
<EOS>
I
appear
as
<EOS>
an
ORNAMENT
of
ENGLISH
SOCIETY
 
<EOS>
all
the
journey
down
to
Hackton
Castle
,
the
large
and
most
ancient
of
our
ancestral
seat
in
Devonshire
,
be
perform
with
the
slow
and
sober
state
become
people
of
the
first
quality
in
the
realm
.
<EOS>
an
outrider
in
my
livery
go
on
before
us
,
and
bespoke
our
lodging
from
town
to
town
;
and
thus
we
lay
in
state
at
Andover
,
Ilminster
,
and
Exeter
;
and
the
fourth
evening
arrive
in
time
for
supper
before
the
antique
baronial
mansion
,
of
which
the
gate
be
in
an
odious
gothic
taste
that
would
have
set
Mr.
Walpole
wild
with
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
the
first
day
of
a
marriage
be
commonly
very
trying
;
and
I
have
know
couple
,
who
live
together
like
turtle
-
dove
for
the
rest
of
their
life
,
peck
each
other
's
eye
out
almost
during
the
honeymoon
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
escape
the
common
lot
;
in
our
journey
westward
my
Lady
Lyndon
choose
to
quarrel
with
me
because
I
pull
out
a
pipe
of
tobacco
(
the
habit
of
smoking
which
I
have
acquire
in
Germany
when
a
soldier
in
Billow
's
,
and
could
never
give
it
over
)
,
and
smoke
it
in
the
carriage
;
and
also
her
ladyship
choose
to
take
umbrage
both
at
Ilminster
and
Andover
,
because
in
the
evening
when
we
lay
there
I
choose
to
invite
the
landlord
of
the
"
Bell
"
and
the
"
Lion
"
to
crack
a
bottle
with
me
.
<EOS>
Lady
Lyndon
be
a
haughty
woman
,
and
I
hate
pride
;
and
I
promise
you
that
in
both
instance
I
overcome
this
vice
in
her
.
<EOS>
on
the
third
day
of
our
journey
I
have
her
to
light
my
pipematch
with
her
own
hand
,
and
make
her
deliver
it
to
me
with
tear
in
her
eye
;
and
at
the
"
Swan
Inn
"
at
Exeter
I
have
so
completely
subdue
her
,
that
she
ask
me
humbly
whether
I
would
not
wish
the
landlady
as
well
as
the
host
to
step
up
to
dinner
with
us
.
<EOS>
to
this
I
should
have
have
no
objection
,
for
,
indeed
,
Mrs.
Bonnyface
be
a
very
good
-
look
woman
;
but
we
expect
a
visit
from
my
Lord
Bishop
,
a
kinsman
of
Lady
Lyndon
,
and
the
bienseance
do
not
permit
the
indulgence
of
my
wife
's
request
.
<EOS>
I
appear
with
her
at
evening
service
,
to
compliment
our
right
reverend
cousin
,
and
put
her
name
down
for
twenty
-
five
guinea
,
and
my
own
for
one
hundred
,
to
the
famous
new
organ
which
be
then
be
build
for
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
this
conduct
,
at
the
very
outset
of
my
career
in
the
county
,
make
me
not
a
little
popular
;
and
the
residentiary
canon
,
who
do
me
the
favour
to
sup
with
me
at
the
inn
,
go
away
after
the
sixth
bottle
,
hiccup
the
most
solemn
vow
for
the
welfare
of
such
a
p
-
p
-
pious
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
before
we
reach
Hackton
Castle
,
we
have
to
drive
through
ten
mile
of
the
Lyndon
estate
,
where
the
people
be
out
to
visit
us
,
<EOS>
the
church
bell
set
a
-
ringing
,
the
parson
and
the
farmer
assemble
in
their
good
by
the
roadside
,
and
the
school
child
and
the
labour
people
be
loud
in
their
hurrah
for
her
Ladyship
.
<EOS>
I
fling
money
among
these
worthy
character
,
stop
to
bow
and
chat
with
his
reverence
and
the
farmer
,
and
if
I
find
that
the
Devonshire
girl
be
among
the
handsome
in
the
kingdom
be
it
my
fault
?
<EOS>
these
remark
my
Lady
Lyndon
especially
would
take
in
great
dudgeon
;
and
I
do
believe
she
be
make
more
angry
by
my
admiration
of
the
red
cheek
of
Miss
Betsy
Quarringdon
of
Clumpton
,
than
by
any
previous
speech
or
act
of
mine
in
the
journey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ah
,
ah
,
my
fine
madam
,
you
be
jealous
,
be
you
?
"
<EOS>
think
I
,
and
reflect
,
not
without
deep
sorrow
,
how
lightly
she
herself
have
act
in
her
husband
's
lifetime
,
and
that
those
be
most
jealous
who
themselves
give
most
cause
for
jealousy
.

Round

wish
they
have
be
oak
when
I
cut
the
tree
down
in
'
79
,
for
they
would
have
fetch
three
time
the
money
:
I
know
nothing
more
culpable
than
the
carelessness
of
ancestor
in
plant
their
ground
with
timber
of
small
value
,
when
they
may
just
as
easily
raise
oak
.
<EOS>
thus
I
have
always
say
that
the
Roundhead
Lyndon
of
Hackton
,
who
plant
these
elm
in
Charles
ii."s
time
,
cheat
me
of
ten
thousand
pound
.
  
<EOS>
for
the
first
few
day
after
our
arrival
,
my
time
be
agreeably
spend
in
receive
the
visit
of
the
nobility
and
gentry
who
come
to
pay
their
respect
to
the
noble
new
-
married
couple
,
and
,
like
Bluebeard
's
wife
in
the
fairy
tale
,
in
inspect
the
treasure
,
the
furniture
,
and
the
numerous
chamber
of
the
castle
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
huge
old
place
,
build
as
far
back
as
Henry
v."s
time
,
besiege
and
batter
by
the
Cromwellians
in
the
Revolution
,
and
alter
and
patch
up
,
in
an
odious
old
-
fashioned
taste
,
by
the
Roundhead
Lyndon
,
who
succeed
to
the
property
at
the
death
of
a
brother
whose
principle
be
excellent
and
of
the
true
Cavalier
sort
,
but
who
ruin
himself
chiefly
by
drinking
,
dicing
,
and
a
dissolute
life
,
and
a
little
by
support
the
King
.
<EOS>
the
castle
stand
in
a
fine
chase
,
which
be
prettily
speckle
over
with
deer
;
and
I
can
not
but
own
that
my
pleasure
be
considerable
at
first
,
as
I
sit
in
the
oak
parlour
of
summer
evening
,
with
the
window
open
,
the
gold
and
silver
plate
shine
in
a
hundred
dazzle
colour
on
the
side
-
board
,
<EOS>
a
dozen
jolly
companion
round
the
table
,
and
could
look
out
over
the
wide
green
park
and
the
wave
wood
,
and
see
the
sun
set
on
the
lake
,
and
hear
the
deer
call
to
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
the
exterior
be
,
when
I
first
arrive
,
a
quaint
composition
of
all
sort
of
architecture
;
of
feudal
tower
,
and
gable
-
end
in
Queen
Bess
's
style
,
and
rough
-
patch
wall
build
up
to
repair
the
ravage
of
the
Roundhead
cannon
:
<EOS>
but
I
need
not
speak
of
this
at
large
,
have
have
the
place
new
-
face
at
a
vast
expense
,
under
a
fashionable
architect
,
and
the
facade
lay
out
in
the
late
french
-
greek
and
most
classical
style
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
moat
,
and
drawbridge
,
and
outer
wall
;
these
I
have
shave
away
into
elegant
terrace
,
and
handsomely
lay
out
in
parterre
accord
to
the
plan
of
Monsieur
Cornichon
,
the
great
parisian
architect
,
who
visit
England
for
the
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
after
ascend
the
outer
step
,
you
enter
an
antique
hall
of
vast
dimension
,
wainscote
with
black
carve
oak
,
and
ornament
with
portrait
of
our
ancestor
:
from
the
square
beard
of
Brook
Lyndon
,
the
great
lawyer
in
<EOS>
Queen
Bess
's
time
,
to
the
loose
stomacher
and
ringlet
of
Lady
Saccharissa
Lyndon
,
whom
Vandyck
paint
when
she
be
a
maid
of
honour
to
Queen
Henrietta
Maria
,
and
down
to
Sir
Charles

with
his

she
be
present
to
the
old
King
George

<EOS>
these
diamond
be
very
fine
:
I
first
have
them
reset
by
Boehmer
when
we
appear
before
their
french

at
Versailles
;
and
finally
raise
L18,000

;

where
you

<EOS>
this
I
keep
pretty
much
in
its
antique
condition
,
but
have
the
old
armour
eventually
turn
out
and
consign
to
the
lumber

room
upstairs
;
replace
it
with
china
monster

gild
settee
from
France
,
and
elegant
marble
,
of
which
the
broken
nose
and
limb
,
and
ugliness
,
undeniably
prove
their
antiquity
:
and
which
an

purchase
for
me
at
Rome
.
<EOS>
but
such
be
the
taste
of
the
time
(
and
,
perhaps
,
the
rascality
of
my
agent
)
,
that
thirty
thousand

worth
of
these
gem
of

only
go
for
three
hundred

all

in
the
most
elegant
taste
;
not
a
little
to
the
scandal
of
some
of
the
steady
old
country
dowager
;
for
I
have
picture
of
Boucher
and
Vanloo
to
decorate
the
principal
apartment
,
in
which
the
Cupids
and
Venuses
be
paint
in
a
manner
so
natural
,
that
I
recollect
the
old
wizene
Countess
of
Frumpington
pin
over
the
curtain
of
her
bed
,
and
send
her
daughter
,
Lady
Blanche
Whalebone
,
to
sleep
with

waiting

rather
than
allow
her
to

over
with
looking

after
the
exact
fashion
of
the
Queen

closet
at

<EOS>
for
many
of
these

I
be
not
so
much
answerable
as
Cornichon
,
whom
Lauraguais
lend
me
,
and
who
be
the
intendant
of
my

during
my
absence
abroad

I

give

as
he
be
decorate
a

in
the

which
have
be
the
old

the

think
it
be
a

of
Heaven
upon
him

<EOS>
in
his
rage
for
improvement
the

dare
anything

<EOS>
without
my

he
cut
down
an
old
rookery

be
sacred
in

have
a

two
lovely

<EOS>
venus
and
Cupids
be
the
rascal
's
adoration
:
he
want
to
take
down
the
gothic
screen
and
place
cupid
in
our
pew
there
;
but
old
Doctor
Huff
the
rector
come
out
with
a
large
oak
stick
,
and
address
the
unlucky
architect
in
Latin
,
of
which
he
do
not
comprehend
a
word
,
yet
make
him
understand
that
he
would
break
his
bone
if
he
lay
a
single
finger
upon

<EOS>
Cornichon
make
complaint
about
the

<EOS>
add
he

quite
bewilder

;
but
I
encourage
the
Church
in
this
respect
,
and
bade
Cornichon
exert
his
talent
only
in
the
castle
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
magnificent
collection
of
ancient
plate
,
to
which
I
add
much
of
the
most
splendid
modern
kind
;
a
cellar
which
,
however
well
furnished
,
require
continual
replenishing
,
and
a
kitchen
which
I
reform
altogether
.
<EOS>
My
friend
,
Jack
Wilkes
,
send
me
down
a
cook
from
the
Mansion
House
,
for
the
english
cookery
,
 
the
turtle
and
venison
department
:
I
have
a
CHEF
(
who
call
out
the
Englishman
,
by
the
way
,
and
complain
sadly
of
the
GROS
COCHON
who
want
to
meet
him
with
COUPS

and
a
couple
of
AIDES
from
Paris
,
and
an
italian
confectioner
,
as
my
OFFICIERS
DE
BOUCHE
.
<EOS>
all
which
natural
appendage
to
a
man
of
fashion
,
the
odious
,
stingy
old
Tiptoff
,
my
kinsman
and
neighbour
,
affect
to
view
with
horror
;
and
he
spread
through
the
country
a
report
that
I
have
my
victual
cook
by
papist
,
live
upon
frog
,
and
,
he
verily
believe
,
fricasseed
little
child
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
squire
eat
my
dinner
very
readily
for
all
that
,
and
old
Doctor
Huff
himself
be
compel
to
allow
that
my
venison
and
turtle
be
most
orthodox
.
<EOS>
the
former
gentry
I
know
how
to
conciliate
,
too
,
in
other
way
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
only
a
subscription
pack
of
fox
-
hound
in
the
county
and
a
few
beggarly
couple
of
mangy
beagle
,
with
which
old
Tiptoff
patter
about
his
ground
;
I
build
a
kennel
and
stable
,
which
cost
L30,000
,
and
stock
them
in
a
manner
which
be
worthy
of
my
ancestor
,
the
irish
king
.
<EOS>
I
have
two
pack
of
hound
,
and
take
the
field
in
the
season
four
time
a
week
,
with
three
gentleman
in
my
hunt
-
uniform
to
follow
me
,
and
open
house
at
Hackton
for
all
who
belong
to
the
hunt
.
  
<EOS>
these
change
and
this
train
de
vivre
require
,
as
may
be
suppose
,
no
small
outlay
;
and
I
confess
that
I
have
little
of
that
base
spirit
of
economy
in
my
composition
which
some
people
practise
and
admire
.
<EOS>
for
instance
,
old
Tiptoff
be
hoard
up
his
money
to
repair
his
father
's
extravagance
and
disencumber
his
estate
;
a
good
deal
of
the
money
with
which
he
pay
off
his
mortgage
my
agent
procure
upon
mine
.
<EOS>
and
,
besides
,
it
must
be
remember
I
have
only
a
life
-
interest
upon
the
Lyndon
property
,
be
always
of
an
easy
temper
in
deal
with
the
money
-
broker
,
and
have
to
pay
heavily
for
insure
her
Ladyship
's
life
.
  
<EOS>
at
the
end
of
a
year
Lady
Lyndon
present
me
with
a
son
 
Bryan
Lyndon
I
call
him
,
in
compliment
to
my
royal
ancestry
:
but
what
more
have
I
to
leave
him
than
a
noble
name
?
<EOS>
be
not
the
estate
of
his
mother
entail
upon
the
odious
little
Turk
,
Lord
Bullingdon
?
<EOS>
and
whom
,
by
the
way
,
I
have
not
mention
as
yet
,
though
he
be
live
at
Hackton
,
consign
to
a
new
governor
.
<EOS>
the
insubordination
of
that
boy
be
dreadful
.
<EOS>
He
use
to
quote
passage
of
"
Hamlet
"
to
his
mother
,
which
make
her
very
angry
.
<EOS>
once
when
I
take
a
horsewhip
to
chastise
him
,
he
draw
a
knife
,
and
would
have
stab
me
:
and
,
"
faith
,
I
recollect
my
own
youth
,
which
be
pretty
similar
;
and
,
hold
out
my
hand
,
burst
out
laugh
,
and
propose
to
him
to
be
friend
.
<EOS>
We
be
reconcile
for
that
time
,
and
the
next
,
and
the
next
;
but
there
be
no
love
lose
between
us
,
and
his
hatred
for
me
seem
to
grow
as
he
grow
,
which
be
apace
.
  
<EOS>
I
determine
to
endow
my
darling
boy
Bryan
with
a
property
,
and
to
this
end
cut
down
twelve
thousand
pound
'
worth
of
timber
on
Lady
Lyndon
's
Yorkshire
and
irish
estate
:
at
which
proceed
Bullingdon
's
guardian
,
Tiptoff
,
cry
out
,
as
usual
,
and
swear
I
have
no
right
to
touch
a
stick
of
the
tree
;
but
down
they
go
;
and
I
commission
my
mother
to
repurchase
the
ancient
land
of
Ballybarry
and
Barryogue
,
which
have
once
form
part
of
the
immense
possession
of
my
house
.
<EOS>
these
she
buy
back
with
excellent
prudence
and
extreme
joy
;
for
her
heart
be
gladden
at
the
idea
that
a
son
be
bear
to
my
name
,
and
with
the
notion
of
my
magnificent
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
to
say
truth
,
I
be
rather
afraid
,
now
that
I
live
in
a
very
different
sphere
from
that
in
which
she
be
accustom
to
move
,
lest
she
should
come
to
pay
me
a
visit
,
and
astonish
my
english
friend
by
her
bragging
and
her
brogue
,
her
rouge
and
her
old
hoop
and
furbelow
of
the
time
of
George
II
.
<EOS>
:
in
which
she
have
figure
advantageously
in
her
youth
,
and
which
she
still
fondly
think
to
be
at
the
height
of
the
fashion
.
<EOS>
so
I
write
to
her
,
put
off
her
visit
;
beg
her
to
visit
us
when
the
left
wing
of
the
castle
be
finish
,
or
the
stable
build
,
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
need
of
such
precaution
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
a
hint
's
enough
for
me
,
Redmond
,
"
the
old
lady
would
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
not
come
to
disturb
you
among
your
great
english
friend
with
my
old
-
fashioned
irish
way
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
blessing
to
me
to
think
that
my
darling
boy
have
attain
the
position
which
I
always
know
be
his
due
,
and
for
which
I
pinch
myself
to
educate
him
.
<EOS>
You
must
bring
me
the
little
Bryan
,
that
his
grandmother
may
kiss
him
,
one
day
.
<EOS>
present
my
respectful
blessing
to
her
ladyship
his
mamma
.
<EOS>
tell
her
she
have
get
a
treasure
in
her
husband
,
which
she
could
not
have
have
have
she
take
a
duke
to
marry
her
;
and
that
the
Barrys
and
the
Bradys
,
though
without
title
,
have
the
good
of
blood
in
their
vein
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
rest
until
I
see
you
Earl
of
Ballybarry
,
and
my
grandson
Lord
Viscount
Barryogue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
how
singular
it
be
that
the
very
same
idea
should
be
pass
in
my
mother
's
mind
and
my
own
!
<EOS>
the
very
title
she
have
pitch
upon
have
also
be
select
(
naturally
enough
)
by
me
;
and
I
do
not
mind
confess
that
I
have
fill
a
dozen
sheet
of
paper
with
my
signature
,
under

Ballybarry
Castle

which
,
you
may
be
sure
,
I
give
out
to
be
a
place
of
no
small
importance
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
plan
of
the
estate
in
my
study
,
both
at
Hackton
and
in
Berkeley
Square

and
the
plan
of
the
elevation
of
Ballybarry
Castle
,
the
ancestral
residence
of
Barry
Lyndon
,
Esq

,
with
the
project
improvement
,
in
which
the
castle
be
represent
as
about
the
size
of
Windsor
,
with
more
ornament
to
the
architecture
;
and
eight
hundred
acre
of
bog
fall
in
handy
,
I
purchase
them
at
three
pound
an
acre

so
that
my
estate

look
to
be
no
insignificant
one

I
also
in

make
arrangement
for
purchase
the
Polwellan
estate
and
mine
in
Cornwall
from
Sir
John
Trecothick
,
for
L70,000
 
an
imprudent
bargain

the

me

<EOS>
the
trouble
of

the
rascality
of
agent

the
quibble

be
endless

<EOS>
humble
people
envy
us
great
man

and
fancy
that
our
life
be
all
pleasure

<EOS>
many
a
time
in
the
course
of
my
prosperity
I
have
sigh
for
the
day
of
my
mean
fortune
,
and
envy
the
boon
companion
at
my
table
,
with
no
clothe
to

back
but
<EOS>
such
as
my
credit
supply
them
,
without
a
guinea
but
what
come
from
my
pocket
;
but
without
one
of
the
harassing
care
and
responsibility
which
be
the
dismal
adjunct
of
great
rank
and
property
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
little
more
than
make
my
appearance
,
and
assume
the
command
of
my
estate
,
in
the
kingdom
of
Ireland
;
reward
generously
those
person
who
have
be
kind
to
me
in
my
former
adversity
,
and
take
my
fitting
place
among
the
aristocracy
of
the
land
.
<EOS>
but
,
in
truth
,
I
have
small
inducement
to
remain
in
it
after
have
taste
of
the
genteeler
and
more
complete
pleasure
of
English
and
continental
life
;
and
we
pass
our
summer
at
Buxton
,
Bath
,
and
Harrogate
,
while
Hackton
Castle
be
be
beautify
in
the
elegant
manner
already
describe
by
me
,
and
the
season
at
our
mansion
in
Berkeley
Square
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
wonderful
how
the
possession
of
wealth
bring
out
the
virtue
of
a
man
;
or
,
at
any
rate
,
act
as
a
varnish
or
lustre
to
them
,
and
bring
out
their
brilliancy
and
colour
in
a
manner
never
know
when
the
individual
stand
in
the
cold
grey
atmosphere
of
poverty
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
it
be
a
very
short
time
before
I
be
a
pretty
fellow
of
the
first
class
;
make
no
small
sensation
at
the
coffee
-
house
in
Pall
Mall
and
afterwards
at
the
most
famous
club
.
<EOS>
My
style
,
equipage
,
and
elegant
entertainment
be
in
everybody
's
mouth
,
and
be
describe
in
all
the
morning
print
.
<EOS>
the
needy
part
of
Lady
Lyndon
's
relative
,
and
such
as
have
be
offend
by
the
intolerable
pomposity
of
old
Tiptoff
,
begin
to
appear
at
our
rout
and
assembly
;
and
as
for
relation
of
my
own
,
I
find
in
London
and
Ireland
more
than
I
have
ever
dream
of
,
of
cousin
who
claim
affinity
with
me
.
<EOS>
there
be
,
of
course
,
native
of
my
own
country
(
of
which
I
be
not
particularly
proud
)
,
and
I
receive
visit
from
three
or
four
swagger
shabby
Temple
buck
,
with
tarnished
lace
and
Tipperary
brogue
,
who
be
eat
their
way
to
the
bar
in
London
;
from
several
gambling
adventurer
at
the
watering
-
place
,
whom
I
soon
speedily
let
to
know
their
place
;
and
from
other
of
more
reputable
condition
.
<EOS>
among
them
I
may
mention
my
cousin
the
Lord
Kilbarry
,
who
,
on
the
score
of
his
relationship
,
borrow
thirty
piece
from
me
to
pay
his
landlady
in
Swallow
Street
;
and
whom
,
for
my
own
reason
,
I
allow
to
maintain
and
credit
a
connection
for
which
the
Heralds
'
College
give
no
authority
whatsoever
.
<EOS>
Kilbarry
have
a
cover
at
my
table
;
punt
at
play
,
and
pay
when
he
like
,
which
be
seldom
;
have
an
intimacy
with
,
and
be
under
considerable
obligation
to
,
my
tailor
;
and
always
boast
of
his
cousin
the
great
Barry
Lyndon
of
the
West
country
.
  
<EOS>
Her
Ladyship
and
I
live
,
after
a
while
,
pretty
separate
when
in
London
.
<EOS>
She
prefer
quiet
:
or
to
say
the
truth
,
I
prefer
it
;
be
a
great
friend
to
a
modest
tranquil
behaviour
in
woman
,
and
a
taste
for
the
domestic
pleasure
.
<EOS>
hence
I
encourage
her
to
dine
at
home
with
her
lady
,
her
chaplain
,
and
a
few
of
her
friend
;
admit
three
or
four
proper
and
discreet
person
to
accompany
her
to
her
box
at
the
opera
or
play
on
proper
occasion
;
and
indeed
decline
for
her
the
too
frequent
visit
of
her
friend
and
family
,
prefer
to
receive
them
only
twice
or
thrice
in
a
season
on
our
grand
reception
day
.
<EOS>
besides
,
she
be
a
mother
,
and
have
great
comfort
in
the
dressing
,
educate
,
and
dandle
our
little
Bryan
,
for
whose
sake
it
be
fit
that
she
should
give
up
the
pleasure
and
frivolity
of
the
world
;
so
she
leave
that
part
of
the
duty
of
every
family
of
distinction
to
be
perform
by
me
.
<EOS>
to
say
the
truth
,
Lady
Lyndon
's
figure
and
appearance
be
not
at
this
time
such
as
to
make
for
their
owner
any
very
brilliant
appearance
in
the
fashionable
world
.
<EOS>
She
have
grow
very
fat
,
be
short
-
sighted
,
pale
in
complexion
,
careless
about
her
dress
,
dull
in
demeanour
;
her
conversation
with
me
characterise
by
a
stupid
despair
,
or
a
silly
blundering
attempt
at
force
cheerfulness
still
more
disagreeable
:
hence
our
intercourse
be
but
trifle
,
and
my
temptation
to
carry
her
into
the
world
,
or
to
remain
in
her
society
,
of
necessity
exceedingly
small
.
<EOS>
She
would
try
my
temper
at
home
,
too
,
in
a
thousand
way
.
<EOS>
when
request
by
me
(
often
,
I
own
,
rather
roughly
)
to
entertain
the
company
with
conversation
,
wit
,
and
learning
,
of
which
she
be
a
mistress
:
or
music
,
of
which
she
be
an
accomplished
performer
,
she
would
as
often
as
not
begin
to
cry
,
and
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
My
company
from
this
,
of
course
,
fancy
I
be
a
tyrant
over
her
;
whereas
I
be
only
a
severe
and
careful
guardian
over
a
silly
,
bad
-
tempered
,
and
weak
-
minded
lady
.
  
<EOS>
She
be
luckily
very
fond
of
her
young
son
,
and
through
him
I
have
a
wholesome
and
effectual
hold
of
her
;
<EOS>
for
if
in
any
of
her
tantrum
or
fit
of
haughtiness
 
(
this
woman
be
intolerably
proud
;
and
repeatedly
,
at
first
,
in
our
quarrel
,
dare
to
twit
me
with
my
own
original
poverty
and
low
birth
)
,
 
if
,
I
say
,
in
our
dispute
she
pretend
to
have
the
upper
hand
,
to
assert
her
authority
against
mine
,
to
refuse
to
sign
such
paper
as
I
may
think
necessary
for
the
distribution
of
our
large
and
complicated
property
,
I
would
have
Master
Bryan
carry
off
to
Chiswick
for
a
couple
of
day
;
and
I
warrant
me
his
lady
-
mother
could
hold
out
no
longer
,
and
would
agree
to
anything
I
choose
to
propose
.
<EOS>
the
servant
about
her
<EOS>
I
take
care
<EOS>
should
be
in
my
pay
,
not
her
:
<EOS>
especially
the
child
's
head
nurse
be
under
my
order
,
not
those
of
my
lady
;
and
a
very
handsome
,
red
-
cheek
,
impudent
jade
she
be
;
and
a
great
fool
<EOS>
she
make
me
make
of
myself
.
<EOS>
this
woman
be
more
mistress
of
the
house
than
the
poor
-
spirit
lady
who
own
it
.
<EOS>
She
give
the
law
to
the
servant
;
and
if
I
show
any
particular
attention
to
any
of
the
lady
who
visit
us
,
the
slut
would
not
scruple
to
show
her
jealousy
,
and
to
find
mean
to
send
them
pack
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
a
generous
man
be
always
make
a
fool
of
by
some
woman
or
other
,
and
this
one
have
such
an
influence
over
me
that
she
could
turn
me
round
her
finger

indeed

it
be
because
justice
have
not

this

<EOS>
have
it

hero
of

one
of
those
heroic
youth
who
figure
in
the
novel

there
would

Mr.
Barry
Lyndon
be
not
,
we
repeat

a
hero
of

common
pattern

let
the
reader
look
round
,
and
ask
himself
,
do
not
as
many
rogue
succeed
in
life
as
honest
man
?
<EOS>
more
fool
than
man
of
talent
?
<EOS>
and
be
it
not
just
that
the
life
of
this
class
should
be
describe
by
the
student
of
human
nature
as
well
as
the
action
of
those
fairy
-
tale
prince
,
those
perfect
impossible
hero
,
whom
our
writer
love
to
describe
?
<EOS>
there
be
something
naive
and
simple
in
that
time
-
honour
style
of
novel
-
writing
by
which
Prince
Prettyman
,
at
the
end

be
put
in
possession
of
every
worldly
prosperity
,
as
he
have
be
endow
with
every
mental
and
bodily
excellence
previously

<EOS>
the
novelist
think
that
he
can
do
no
more
for
his
darling
hero
than
make
him
a
lord
.
<EOS>
be
it
not
a
poor
standard
that
,
of
the
summum
bonum

<EOS>
the
great
good
in
life
be
not
to
be
a
lord

perhaps
not
even
to
be
happy

<EOS>
poverty
,
illness
,
a
humpback

may
be
reward
and
condition
of
good
,
as
well
as
that
bodily
prosperity
which
all
of
us
unconsciously
set
up
for
worship
.
<EOS>
but
this
be
a
subject
for
an
essay
,
not
a
note
;

it
be
good
to
allow
Mr.

candid

ingenious
narrative
of

virtue

defect

Her
infernal
temper

I

timid

be
infernally
bite

though

could
ride
a

as

be
no

both

I

one

<EOS>
I
have
always
a
taste
for
man
of
letter
,
and
perhaps
,
if
the
truth
must
be
tell
,
have
no
objection
to
play
the
fine
gentleman
and
patron
among
the
wit
.
<EOS>
such
people
be
usually
needy
,
and
of
low
birth
,
and
have
an
instinctive
awe
and
love
of
a
gentleman
and
a
laced
coat
;
as
all
must
have
remark
who
have
frequent
their
society
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Reynolds
,
who
be
afterwards
knight
,
and
certainly
the
most
elegant
painter
of
his
day
,
be
a
pretty
dexterous
courtier
of
the
wit
tribe
;
and
it
be
through
this
gentleman
,
who
paint
a
piece
of
me
,
Lady
Lyndon
,
and
our
little
Bryan
,
which
be
greatly
admire
at

exhibition

(
I

;
it
be
through
Mr.
Reynolds
that
I
be
introduce
to
a
score
of
these
gentleman
,
and
their
great
chief
,
Mr.
Johnson

<EOS>
I
always
think
their
great
chief
a
great
bear
.
<EOS>
He
drink
tea
twice
or
thrice
at
my
house
,
misbehave
himself
most
grossly
;
treat
my
opinion
with
no
more
respect
than
those
of
a
schoolboy
,
and
tell
me
to
mind
my
horse
and
tailor
,
and
not
trouble
myself
about
letter
.
<EOS>
His
Scotch
bear
-
leader
,
Mr.
Boswell
,
be
a
butt
of
the
first
quality
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
such
a
figure
as
the
fellow
cut
in
what
he
call
a
corsican
habit
,
at
one
of
Mrs.
Cornely
's
ball
,
at
Carlisle
House
,
Soho
.
<EOS>
but
that
the
story
connect
with
that
same
establishment
be
not
the
most
profitable
tale
in
the
world
,
I
could
tell
tale
of
score
of
queer
doing
there
.
<EOS>
all
the
high
and
low
demirep
of
the
town
gather
there
,
from
his
grace
of
Ancaster
down
to
my
countryman
,
poor
Mr.
Oliver
Goldsmith
the
poet
,
and
from
the
Duchess
of
Kingston
down
to
the
Bird
of
Paradise
,
or
Kitty
Fisher
.
<EOS>
here
I
have
meet
very
queer
character
,
who
come
to
queer
<EOS>
end
too
:
<EOS>
poor
Hackman
,
that
afterwards
be
hang
for
kill
Miss
Reay
,
and
(
on
the
sly
)
<EOS>
his
Reverence
Doctor
Simony
,
whom
my
friend
Sam
Foote
,
of
the
"
Little
Theatre
,
"
bade
to
live
even
after
forgery
and
the
rope
cut
short
the
unlucky
parson
's
career
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
a
merry
place
,
London
,
in
those
day
,
and
that
be
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
be
write
now
in
my
gouty
old
age
,
and
people
have
grow
vastly
more
moral
and
matter
-
of
-
fact
than
they
be
at
the
close
of
the
last
century
,
when
the
world
be
young
with
me
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
difference
between
a
gentleman
and
a
common
fellow
in
those
time
.
<EOS>
We
wear
silk
and
embroidery
then
.
<EOS>
now
every
man
have
the
same
coachmanlike
look
in
his
belcher
and
cap
coat
,
and
there
be
no
outward
difference
between
my
Lord
and
his
groom
.
<EOS>
then
it
take
a
man
of
fashion
a
couple
of
hour
to
make
his
toilette
,
and
he
could
show
some
taste
and
genius
in
the
selecting
it
.
<EOS>
what
a
blaze
of
splendour
be
a
drawing
-
room
,
or
an
opera
,
of
a
gala
night
!
<EOS>
what
sum
of
money
be
lose
and
win
at
the
delicious
faro
-
table
!
<EOS>
My
gilt
curricle
and
out
-
rider
,
blaze
in
green
and
gold
,
be
very
different
object
from
the
equipage
you
see
nowadays
in
the
ring
,
with
the
stunted
groom
behind
them
.
<EOS>
a
man
could
drink
four
time
as
much
as
the
milksop
nowadays
can
swallow
;
but
'
tis
useless
expatiate
on
this
theme
.
<EOS>
gentleman
be
dead
and
go
.
<EOS>
the
fashion
have
now
turn
upon
your
soldier
and
sailor
,
and
I
grow
quite
moody
and
sad
when
I
think
of
thirty
year
ago
.
  
<EOS>
this
be
a
chapter
devote
to
reminiscence
of
what
be
a
very
happy
and
splendid
time
with
me
,
but
present
little
of
mark
in
the
way
of
adventure
;
as
be
generally
the
case
when
time
be
happy
and
easy
.
<EOS>
It
would
seem
idle
to
fill
page
with
account
of
the
every
-
day
occupation
of
a
man
of
fashion
,
 
the
fair
lady
who
smile
upon
him
,
the
dress
he
wear
,
the
match
he
play
,
and
win
or
lose
.
<EOS>
at
this
period
of
time
,
when
youngster
be
employ
cut
the
Frenchmen
's
throat
in
Spain
and
France
,
lie
out
in
bivouacs
,
and
feed
off
commissariat
beef
and
biscuit
,
they
would
not
understand
what
a
life
their
ancestor
lead
;
and
so
I
shall
leave
further
discourse
upon
the
pleasure
of
the
time
when
even
the
Prince
be
a
lad
in
lead
-
string
,
when
Charles
Fox
have
not
subside
into
a
mere
statesman
,
and
Buonaparte
be
a
beggarly
brat
in
his
native
island
.
  
<EOS>
whilst
these
improvement
be
go
on
in
my
estate
,
 
my
house
,
from
an
antique
Norman
castle
,
be
change
to
an
elegant
greek
temple
,
or
palace
 
my
garden
and
wood
lose
their
rustic
appearance
to
be
adapt
to
the
most
genteel
french
style
 
my
child
grow
up
at
his
mother
's
knee
,
and
my
influence
in
the
country
increase
,
 
<EOS>
it
must
not
be
imagine
that
I
stay
in
Devonshire
all
this
while
,
and
that
I
neglect
to
make
visit
to
London
,
and
my
various
estate
in
England
and
Ireland
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
to
reside
at
the
Trecothick
estate
and
the
Polwellan
Wheal
,
where
I
find
,
instead
of
profit
,
every
kind
of
pettifog
chicanery
;
I
pass
over
in
state
to
our
territory
in
Ireland
,
where
I
entertain
the
gentry
in
a
style
the
Lord
Lieutenant
himself
could
not
equal
;
give
the
fashion
to
Dublin
(
to
be
sure
it
be
a
beggarly
savage
city
in
those
day
;
and
,
since
the
time
there
have
be
a
pother
about
the
Union
,
and
the
misfortune
attend
it
,
I
have
be
at
a
loss
to
account
for
the
mad
praise
of
the
old
order
of
thing
,
which
the
fond
irish
patriot
have
invent
)
<EOS>
;
I
say
I
set
the
fashion
to
Dublin
;
and
small
praise
to
me
,
for
a
poor
place
it
be
in
those
time
,
whatever
the
irish
party
may
say
.
  
<EOS>
in
a
former
chapter
I
have
give
you
a
description
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
Warsaw
of
our
part
of
the
world
:
there
be
a
splendid
,
ruin
,
half
-
civilised
nobility
,
rule
over
a
half
-
savage
population
.
<EOS>
I
say
half
-
savage
advisedly
.
<EOS>
the
commonalty
in
the
street
be
wild
,
unshorn
,
and
in
rag
.
<EOS>
the
most
public
place
be
not
safe
after
nightfall
.
<EOS>
the
College
,
the
public
building
,
and
the
great
gentry
's
house
be
splendid
(
the
latter
unfinished
for
the
most
part
)
;
but
the
people
be
in
a
state
more
wretched
than
any
vulgar
I
have
ever
know
:
the
exercise
of
their
religion
be
only
half
allow
to
them
;
their
clergy
be
force
to
be
educate
out
of
the
country
;
their
aristocracy
be
quite
distinct
from
them
;
there
be
a
protestant
nobility
,
and
in
the
town
,
poor
insolent
protestant
corporation
,
with
a
bankrupt
retinue
of
mayor
,
alderman
,
and
municipal
officer
 
<EOS>
all
of
whom
figure
in
address
and
have
the
public
voice
in
the
country
;
but
there
be
no
sympathy
and
connection
between
the
upper
and
the
low
people
of
the
Irish
.
<EOS>
to
one
who
have
be
breed
so
much
abroad
as
myself
,
this
difference
between
Catholic
and
Protestant
be
doubly
strike
;
and
though
as
firm
as
a
rock
in
my
own
faith
,
yet
I
could
not
help
remember
my
grandfather
hold
a
different
one
,
and
wonder
that
there
should
be
such
a
political
difference
between
the
two
.
<EOS>
I
pass
among
my
neighbour
for
a
dangerous
leveller
,
for
entertain
and
express
such
opinion
,
and
especially
for
ask
the
priest
of
the
parish
to
my
table
at
Castle
Lyndon
.
<EOS>
He
be
a
gentleman
,
educate
at
Salamanca
,
and
,
to
my
mind
,
a
far
better
breed
and
more
agreeable
companion
than
his
comrade
the
rector
,
who
have
but
a
dozen
Protestants
for
his
congregation
;
who
be
a
lord
's
son
,
to
be
sure
,
but
he
could
hardly
spell
,
and
the
great
field
of
his
labours
be
in
the
kennel
and
cockpit
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
not
extend
and
beautify
the
house
of
Castle
Lyndon
as
I
have
do
our
other
estate
,
but
content
myself
with
pay
an
occasional
visit
there
;
exercise
an
almost
royal
hospitality
,
and
keep
open
house
during
my
stay
.
<EOS>
when
absent
,
I
give
to
my
aunt
,
the
widow
Brady
,
and
her
six
unmarried
daughter
(
although
they
always
detest
me
)
,
permission
to
inhabit
the
place
;
my
mother
prefer
my
new
mansion
of
Barryogue
.
  
<EOS>
and
as
my
Lord
Bullingdon
be
by
this
time
grow
excessively
tall
and
troublesome
,
I
determine
to
leave
him
under
the
care
of
a
proper
governor
in
Ireland
,
with
Mrs.
Brady
and
her
six
daughter
to
take
care
of
him
;
and
he
be
welcome
to
fall
in
love
with
all
the
old
lady
if
he
be
so
minded
,
and
thereby
imitate
his
stepfather
's
example
.
<EOS>
when
tired
of
Castle
Lyndon
,
his
lordship
be
at
liberty
to
go
and
reside
at
my
house
with
my
mamma
;
but
there
be
no
love
lose
between
him
and
her
,
and
,
on
account
of
my
son
Bryan
,
I
think
she
hate
him
as
cordially
as
ever
<EOS>
I
myself
could
possibly
do
.
  
<EOS>
the
county
of
Devon
be
not
so
lucky
as
the
neighbour
county
of
Cornwall
,
and
have
not
the
share
of
representative
which
the
latter
possess
;
where
I
have
know
a
moderate
country
gentleman
,
with
a
few
score
of
hundred
per
annum
from
his
estate
,
treble
his
income
by
return
three
or
four
member
to
Parliament
,
and
by
the
influence
with
minister
which
these
seat
give
him
.
<EOS>
the
parliamentary
interest
of
the
house
of
Lyndon
have
be
grossly
neglect
during
my
wife
's
minority
,
and
the
incapacity
of
the
Earl
her
father
;
or
,
to
speak
more
correctly
,
it
have
be
smuggle
away
from
the
Lyndon
family
altogether
by
the
adroit
old
hypocrite
of
Tiptoff
Castle
,
who
act
as
most
kinsman
and
guardian
do
by
their
ward
and
relative
,
and
rob
them
.
<EOS>
the
Marquess
of
Tiptoff
return
four
member
to
Parliament
:
two
for
the
borough
of
Tippleton
,
which
,
as
all
the
world
know
,
lie
at
the
foot
of
our
estate
of
Hackton
,
bound
on
the
other
side
by
Tiptoff
Park
.
<EOS>
for
time
out
of
mind
we
have
send
member
for
that
borough
,
until
Tiptoff
,
take
advantage
of
the
late
lord
's
imbecility
,
put
in
his
own
nominee
.
<EOS>
when
his
eld
son
become
of
age
,
of
course
my
Lord
be
to
take
his
seat
for
Tippleton
;
when
Rigby
(
Nabob
Rigby
,
who
make
his
fortune
under
Clive
in
India
)
die
,
the
Marquess
think
fit
to
bring
down
his
second
son
,
my
Lord
George
Poynings
,
to
whom
I
have
introduce
the
reader
in
a
former
chapter
,
and
determine
,
in
his
high
mightiness
,
that
he
too
should
go
in
and
swell
the
rank
of
the
opposition
 
<EOS>
the
big
old
Whigs
,
with
whom
the
Marquess
act
.
  
<EOS>
Rigby
have
be
for
some
time
in
an
ail
condition
previous
to
his
demise
,
and
you
may
be
sure
that
the
circumstance
of
his
fail
health
have
not
be
pass
over
by
the
gentry
of
the
county
,
who
be
staunch
Government
man
for
the
most
part
,
and
hate
my
Lord
Tiptoff
's
principle
as
dangerous
and
ruinous
,
"
We
have
be
look
out
for
a
man
to
fight
against
him
,
"
say
the
squire
to
me
;
"
we
can
only
match
Tiptoff
out
of
Hackton
Castle
.
<EOS>
You
,
Mr.
Lyndon
,
be
our
man
,
and
at
the
next
county
election
we
will
swear
to
bring
you
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hate
the
Tiptoffs
so
,
that
I
would
have
fight
them
at
any
election
.
<EOS>
They
not
only
would
not
visit
at
Hackton
,
but
decline
to
receive
those
who
visit
us
;
they
keep
the
woman
of
the
county
from
receive
my
wife
:
they
invent
half
the
wild
story
of
my
profligacy
and
extravagance
with
which
the
neighbourhood
be
entertain
;
they
say
I
have
frighten
my
wife
into
marriage
,
and
that
she
be
a
lost
woman
;
they
hint
that
Bullingdon
's
life
be
not
secure
under
my
roof
,
that
his
treatment
be
odious
,
and
that
I
want
to
put
him
out
of
the
way
to
make
place
for
Bryan
my
son
.
<EOS>
I
could
scarce
have
a
friend
to
Hackton
,
but
they
count
the
bottle
drunk
at
my
table
.
<EOS>
They
ferret
out
my
dealing
with
my
lawyer
and
agent
.
<EOS>
if
a
creditor
be
unpaid
,
every
item
of
his
bill
be
know
at
Tiptoff
Hall
;
if
I
look
at
a
farmer
's
daughter
,
it
be
say
I
have
ruin
her
.
<EOS>
My
fault
be
many
,
I
confess
,
and
as
a
domestic
character
,
I
can
not
boast
of
any
particular
regularity
or
temper
;
but
Lady
Lyndon
and
<EOS>
I
do
not
quarrel
more
than
fashionable
people
do
,
and
,
at
first
,
we
always
use
to
make
it
up
pretty
well
.
<EOS>
I
be
a
man
full
of
error
,
certainly
,
but
not
the
devil
that
these
odious
backbiter
at
Tiptoff
represent
me
to
be
.
<EOS>
for
the
first
three
year
I
never
strike
my
wife
but
when
I
be
in
liquor
.
<EOS>
when
I
fling
the
carving
-
knife
at
Bullingdon
<EOS>
I
be
drunk
,
as
everybody
present
can
testify
;
but
as
for
have
any
systematic
scheme
against
the
poor
lad
,
I
can
declare
solemnly
that
,
beyond
merely
hate
him
(
and
one
's
inclination
be
not
in
one
's
power
)
,
I
be
guilty
of
no
evil
towards
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
sufficient
motive
,
then
,
for
enmity
against
the
Tiptoffs
,
and
be
not
a
man
to
let
a
feeling
of
that
kind
lie
inactive
.
<EOS>
though
a
Whig
,
or
,
perhaps
,
because
a
Whig
,
the
Marquess
be
one
of
the
haughty
man
breathe
,
and
treat
commoner
as
his
idol
the
great
Earl
use
to
treat
them
 
after
he
come
to
a
coronet
himself
 
as
so
many
low
vassal
,
who
may
be
proud
to
lick
his
shoe
-
buckle
.
<EOS>
when
the
Tippleton
mayor
and
corporation
wait
upon
him
,
he
receive
them
cover
,
never
offer
Mr.
Mayor
a
chair
,
but
retire
when
the
refreshment
be
bring
,
or
have
them
serve
to
the
worshipful
alderman
in
the
steward
's
room
.
<EOS>
these
honest
briton
never
rebel
against
such
treatment
,
until
instruct
to
do
so
by
my
patriotism
.
<EOS>
no
,
the
dog
like
to
be
bully
;
and
,
in
the
course
of
a
long
experience
,
I
have
meet
with
but
very
few
englishman
who
be
not
of
their
way
of
thinking
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
I
open
their
eye
that
they
know
their
degradation
.
<EOS>
I
invite
the
Mayor
to
Hackton
,
and
Mrs.
Mayoress
(
a
very
buxom
pretty
groceress
she
be
,
by
the
way
)
<EOS>
I
make
sit
by
my
wife
,
and
drive
them
both
out
to
the
race
in
my
curricle
.
<EOS>
Lady
Lyndon
fight
very
hard
against
this
condescension
;
but
I
have
a
way
with
her
,
as
the
saying
be
,
and
though
she
have
a
temper
,
yet
I
have
a
well
one
.
<EOS>
a
temper
,
psha
!
<EOS>
a
wild
-
cat
have
a
temper
,
but
a
keeper
can
get
the
well
of
it
;
and
I
know
very
few
woman
in
the
world
whom
I
could
not
master
.
  
<EOS>
well
,
I
make
much
of
the
mayor
and
corporation
;
send
them
buck
for
their
dinner
,
or
ask
them
to
mine
;
make
a
point
of
attend
their
assembly
,
dance
with
their
wife
and
daughter
,
go
through
,
in
short
,
all
the
act
of
politeness
which
be
necessary
on
such
occasion
:
and
though
old
Tiptoff
must
have
see
my
going
on
,
yet
his
head
be
so
much
in
the
cloud
,
that
he
never
once
condescend
to
imagine
his
dynasty
could
be
overthrow
in
his
own
town
of
Tippleton
,
and
issue
his
mandate
as
securely
as
if
he
have
be
the
Grand
Turk
,
and
the
Tippletonians
no
better
than
so
many
slave
of
his
will
.
  
<EOS>
every
post
which
bring
us
any
account
of
Rigby
's
increase
illness
,
be
the
sure
occasion
of
a
dinner
from
me
;
so
much
so
,
that
my
friend
of
the
hunt
use
to
laugh
and
say
,
"
Rigby
's
bad
;
there
be
a
corporation
dinner
at
Hackton
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
1776
,
when
the
american
war
break
out
,
that
I
come
into
Parliament
.
<EOS>
My
Lord
Chatham
,
whose
wisdom
his
party
in
those
day
use
to
call
superhuman
,
raise
his
oracular
voice
in
the
House
of
Peers
against
the
american
contest
;
and
my
countryman
,
Mr.
Burke
 
<EOS>
a
great
philosopher
,
but
<EOS>
a
plaguy
long
-
winded
orator
 
be
the
champion
of
the
rebel
in
the
Commons
 
<EOS>
where
,
however
,
thank
to
british
patriotism
,
he
could
get
very
few
to
back
him
.
<EOS>
Old
Tiptoff
would
have
swear
black
<EOS>
be
white
if
the
great
Earl
have
bid
him
;
and
he
make
his
son
give
up
his
commission
in
the
Guards
,
in
imitation
of
my
Lord
Pitt
,
who
resign
his
ensigncy
rather
than
fight
against
what
he
call
his
american
brother
.
  
<EOS>
but
this
be
a
height
of
patriotism
extremely
little
relish
in
England
,
where
,
ever
since
the
breaking
out
of
hostility
,
our
people
hate
the
Americans
heartily
;
and
where
,
when
we
hear
of
the
fight
of
Lexington
,
and
the
glorious
victory
of
Bunker
's
Hill
(
as
we
use
to
call
it
in
those
day
)
<EOS>
,
the
nation
flush
out
in
its
usual
hot
-
head
anger
.
<EOS>
the
talk
be
all
against
the
philosopher
after
that
,
and
the
people
be
most
indomitably
loyal
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
until
the
land
-
tax
be
increase
,
that
the
gentry
begin
to
grumble
a
little
;
but
still
my
party
in
the
West
be
very
strong
against
the
Tiptoffs
,
and
I
determine
to
take
the
field
and
win
as
usual
.
  
<EOS>
the
old
Marquess
neglect
every
one
of
the
decent
precaution
which
be
requisite
in
a
parliamentary
campaign
.
<EOS>
He
signify
to
the
corporation
and
freeholder
his
intention
of
present
his
son
,
Lord
George
,
and
his
desire
that
the
latter
should
be
elect
their
burgess
;
but
he
scarcely
give
so
much
as
a
glass
of
beer
to
whet
the
devotedness
of
his
adherent
:
and
I
,
as
I
need
not
say
,
engage
every
tavern
in
Tippleton
in
my
behalf
.
  
<EOS>
there
be
no
need
to
go
over
the
twenty
-
time
-
tell
tale
of
an
election
.
<EOS>
I
rescue
the
borough
of
Tippleton
from
the
hand
of
Lord
Tiptoff
and
his
son
,
Lord
George
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
savage
sort
of
satisfaction
,
too
,
in
force
my
wife
(
who
have
be
at
one
time
exceedingly
smite
by
her
kinsman
,
as
I
have
already
relate
)
to
take
part
against
him
,
and
to
wear
and
distribute
my
colour
when
the
day
of
election
come
.
<EOS>
and
when
we
speak
at
one
another
,
I
tell
the
crowd
that
I
have
beat
Lord
George
in
love
,
that
I
have
beat
him
in
war
,
and
that
I
would
now
beat
him
in
Parliament
;
and
so
I
do
,
as
the
event
prove
:
for
,
to
the
inexpressible
anger
of
the
old
Marquess
,
Barry
Lyndon
,
Esquire
,
be
return
member
of
Parliament
for
Tippleton
,
in
place
of
John
Rigby
,
Esquire
,
decease
;
and
I
threaten
him
at
the
next
election
to
turn
him
out
of
both
his
seat
,
and
go
to
attend
my
duty
in
Parliament
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
then
I
seriously
determine
on
achieve
for
myself
the
irish
peerage
,
to
be
enjoy
after
me
by
my
beloved
son
and
heir
.
   
<EOS>
my
good
<EOS>
FORTUNE
begin
to
WAVER
 
<EOS>
and
now
,
if
any
people
should
be
dispose
to
think
my
history
immoral
(
for
I
have
hear
some
assert
that
I
be
a
man
who
never
deserve
that
so
much
prosperity
should
fall
to
my
share
)
,
I
will
beg
those
caviller
to
do
me
the
favour
to
read
the
conclusion
of
my
adventure
;
when
they
will
see
it
be
no
such
great
prize
that
I
have
win
,
and
that
wealth
,
splendour
,
thirty
thousand
per
annum
,
and
a
seat
in
Parliament
,
be
often
purchase
at
too
dear
a
rate
,
when
one
have
to
buy
those
enjoyment
at
the
price
of
personal
liberty
,
and
saddle
with
the
charge
of
a
troublesome
wife
.
  
<EOS>
They
be
the
deuce
,
these
troublesome
wife
,
and
that
be
the
truth
.
<EOS>
no
man
know
until
he
try
how
wearisome
and
dishearten
the
burthen
of
one
of
them
be
,
and
how
the
annoyance
grow
and
strengthen
from
year
to
year
,
and
the
courage
become
weak
to
bear
it
;
so
that
that
trouble
which
seem
light
and
trivial
the
first
year
,
become
intolerable
ten
year
after
.
<EOS>
I
have
hear
of
one
of
the
classical
fellow
in
the
dictionary
who
begin
by
carry
a
calf
up
a
hill
every
day
,
and
so
continued
until
the
animal
grow
to
be
a
bull
,
which
he
still
easily
accommodate
upon
his
shoulder
;
but
take
my
word
for
it
,
young
unmarried
gentleman
,
a
wife
be
a
very
much
hard
pack
to
the
back
than
the
big
heifer
in
Smithfield
<EOS>
and
,
if
I
can
prevent
one
of
you
from
marry
,
the
"
Memoirs
of
Barry
Lyndon
,
Esq
.
"
will
not
be
write
in
vain
.
<EOS>
not
that
my
Lady
be
a
scold
or
a
shrew
,
as
some
wife
be
;
I
could
have
manage
to
have
cure
her
of
that
;
but
she
be
of
a
cowardly
,
crying
,
melancholy
,
maudlin
temper
,
which
be
to
me
still
more
odious
<EOS>
:
do
what
one
would
to
please
her
,
she
would
never
be
happy
or
in
good
-
humour
.
<EOS>
I
leave
her
alone
after
a
while
;
and
because
,
as
be
natural
in
my
case
,
where
a
disagreeable
home
oblige
me
to
seek
amusement
and
companion
abroad
,
she
add
a
mean
detestable
jealousy
to
all
her
other
fault
:
I
could
not
for
some
time
pay
the
common
attention
to
any
other
woman
,
but
my
Lady
Lyndon
must
weep
,
and
wre
her
hand
,
and
threaten
to
commit
suicide
,
and
I
know
not
what
.
  
<EOS>
Her
death
would
have
be
no
comfort
to
me
,
as
I
leave
any
person
of
common
prudence
to
imagine
;
for
that
scoundrel
of
a
young
Bullingdon
(
who
be
now
grow
up
a
tall
,
gawky
,
swarthy
lad
,
and
about
to
become
my
great
plague
and
annoyance
)
would
have
inherit
every
penny
of
the
property
,
and
I
should
have
be
leave
considerably
poor
even
than
when
I
marry
the
widow
:
for
I
spend
my
personal
fortune
as
well
as
the
lady
's
income
in
the
keeping
up
of
our
rank
,
and
be
always
too
much
a
man
of
honour
and
spirit
to
save
a
penny
of
Lady
Lyndon
's
income
.
<EOS>
let
this
be
fling
in
the
tooth
of
my
detractor
,
<EOS>
who
say
I
never
could
have
<EOS>
so
injure
<EOS>
the
Lyndon
property
have
I
not
be
make
a
private
purse
for
myself
;
and
who
believe
that
,
even
in
my
present
painful
situation
,
I
have
hoard
of
gold
lay
by
somewhere
,
and
could
come
out
as
a
Croesus
when
I
choose
.
<EOS>
I
never
raise
a
shilling
upon
Lady
Lyndon
's
property
<EOS>
but
I
spend
it
like
a
man
of
honour
;
besides
incur
numberless
personal
obligation
for
money
,
which
all
go
to
the
common
stock
.
<EOS>
independent
of
the
Lyndon
mortgage
and
incumbrance
,
I
owe
myself
at
least
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
pound
,
which
I
spend
while
in
occupancy
of
my
wife
's
estate
;
<EOS>
so
that
I
may
justly
say
that
property
be
indebted
to
me
in
the
above
-
mention
sum
.
  
<EOS>
although
I
have
describe
the
utter
disgust
and
distaste
which
speedily
take
possession
of
my
breast
as
regarded
Lady
Lyndon
;
and
although
I
take
no
particular
pain
(
for
I
be
all
frankness
and
above
-
board
)
to
disguise
my
feeling
in
general
,
yet
she
be
of
such
a
mean
spirit
,
that
she
pursue
me
with
her
regard
in
spite
of
my
indifference
to
her
,
and
would
kindle
up
at
the
small
kind
word
I
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
between
my
respect
reader
and
myself
,
that
I
be
one
of
the
handsome
and
most
dash
young
man
of
England
in
those
day
,
and
my
wife
be
violently
in
love
with
me
;
and
though
I
say
it
who
should
not
,
as
the
phrase
go
,
my
wife
be
not
the
only
woman
of
rank
in
London
who
have
a
favourable
opinion
of
the
humble
irish
adventurer
.
<EOS>
what
a
riddle
these
woman
be
,
I
have
often
think
!
<EOS>
I
have
see
the
most
elegant
creature
at
St.
James
's
grow
wild
for
love
of
the
coarse
and
most
vulgar
of
man
;
the
clever
woman
passionately
admire
the
most
illiterate
of
our
sex
,
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
there
be
no
end
to
the
contrariety
in
the
foolish
creature
;
and
though
I
do
not
mean
to
hint
that
_
I
_
be
vulgar
or
illiterate
,
as
the
person
mention
above
(
I
would
cut
the
throat
of
any
man
who
dare
to
whisper
a
word
against
my
birth
or
my
breeding
)
,
yet
I
have
show
that
Lady
Lyndon
have
plenty
of
reason
to
dislike
me
if
she
choose
:
but
,
like
the
rest
of
her
silly
sex
,
she
be
govern
by
infatuation
,
not
reason
;
and
,
up
to
the
very
last
day
of
our
be
together
,
would
be
reconcile
to
me
,
and
fondle
me
,
if
I
address
her
a
single
kind
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
ah
,
"
she
would
say
,
in
these
moment
of
tenderness
 
<EOS>
"
ah
,
REDMOND
,
if
you
would
always
be
so
!
"
<EOS>
and
in
these
fit
of
love
she
be
the
most
easy
creature
in
the
world
to
be
persuade
,
and
would
have
sign
away
her
whole
property
,
<EOS>
have
it
be
possible
.
<EOS>
and
,
I
must
confess
,
it
be
with
very
little
attention
on
my
part
that
I
could
bring
her
into
good
-
humour
.
<EOS>
to
walk
with
her
on
the
Mall
,
or
at
Ranelagh
,
to
attend
her
to
church
at
St.
James
's
,
to
purchase
any
little
present
or
trinket
for
her
,
be
enough
to
coax
her
.
<EOS>
such
be
female
inconsistency
!
<EOS>
the
next
day
she
would
be
call
me
"
Mr.
Barry
"
probably
,
and
be
bemoan
her
miserable
fate
that
she
ever
should
have
be
unite
to
such
a
monster
.
<EOS>
so
it
be
she
be
pleased
to
call
one
of
the
most
brilliant
man
in
His
Majesty
's
three
kingdom
:
and
I
warrant
me
other
lady
have
a
much
more
flattering
opinion
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
then
she
would
threaten
to
leave
me
;
but
I
have
a
hold
of
her
in
the
person
of
her
son
,
of
whom
she
be
passionately
fond
<EOS>
:
I
do
not
know
why
,
for
she
have
always
neglect
Bullingdon
her
old
son
,
and
never
bestow
a
thought
upon
his
health
,
his
welfare
,
or
his
education
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
our
young
boy
,
then
,
who
form
the
great
bond
of
union
between
me
and
her
ladyship
;
and
there
be
no
plan
of
ambition
I
could
propose
in
which
she
would
not
join
for
the
poor
lad
's
behoof
,
and
no
expense
she
would
not
eagerly
incur
,
if
it
may
by
any
mean
be
show
to
tend
to
his
advancement
.
<EOS>
I
can
tell
you
,
bribe
be
administer
,
and
in
high
place
too
,
 
so
near
the
royal
person
of
His
Majesty
,
that
you
would
be
astonish
be
I
to
mention
what
great
personage
condescend
to
receive
our
loan
.
<EOS>
I
get
from
the
english
and
irish
herald
a
description
and
detailed
pedigree
of
the
Barony
of
Barryogue
,
and
claim
respectfully
to
be
reinstate
in
my
ancestral
title
,
and
also
to
be
reward
with
the
Viscounty
of
Ballybarry
.
<EOS>
"
this
head
would
become
a
coronet
,
"
my
Lady
would
sometimes
say
,
in
her
fond
moment
,
smooth
down
my
hair
;
and
,
indeed
,
there
be
many
a
puny
whipster
in
their
lordship
'
house
who
have
neither
my
presence
nor
my
courage
,
my
pedigree
,
nor
any
of
my
merit
.
  
<EOS>
the
striving
after
this
peerage
I
consider
to
have
be
one
of
the
most
unlucky
of
all
my
unlucky
dealing
at
this
period
.
<EOS>
I
make
unheard
-
of
sacrifice
to
bring
it
about
.
<EOS>
I
lavish
money
here
and
diamond
there
.
<EOS>
I
buy
land
at
ten
time
their
value
;
purchase
picture
and
article
of
vertu
at
ruinous
price
.
<EOS>
I
give
repeat
entertainment
to
those
friend
to
my
claim
who
,
be
about
the
royal
person
,
be
likely
to
advance
it
.
<EOS>
I
lose
many
a
bet
to
the
Royal
duke
<EOS>
His
Majesty
's
brother
;
but
let
these
matter
be
forget
,
and
,
because
of
my
private
injury
,
let
me
not
be
deficient
in
loyalty
to
my
Sovereign
.
  
<EOS>
the
only
person
in
this
transaction
whom
I
shall
mention
openly
,
be
that
old
scamp
and
swindler
,
Gustavus
Adolphus
,
thirteenth
Earl
of
Crabs
.
<EOS>
this
nobleman
be
one
of
the
gentleman
of
His
Majesty
's
closet
,
and
one
with
whom
the
revere
monarch
be
on
term
of
considerable
intimacy
.
<EOS>
a
close
regard
have
spring
up
between
them
in
the
old
King
's
time
;
when
His
Royal
Highness
,
play
at
battledore
and
shuttlecock
with
the
young
lord
on
the
landing
-
place
of
the
great
staircase
at
Kew
,
in
some
moment
of
irritation
the
Prince
of
Wales
kick
the
young
Earl
downstairs
,
who
,
fall
,
break
his
leg
.
<EOS>
the
Prince
's
hearty
repentance
for
his
violence
cause
him
to
ally
himself
closely
with
the
person
whom
he
have
injure
;
and
when
His
Majesty
come
to
the
throne
there
be
no
man
,
it
be
say
,
of
whom
the
Earl
of
Bute
be
so
jealous
as
of
my
Lord
Crabs
.
<EOS>
the
latter
be
poor
and
extravagant
,
and
Bute
get
him
out
of
the
way
,
by
send
him
on
the
russian
and
other
embassy
;
but
on
this
favourite
's
dismissal
,
Crabs
speed
back
from
the
continent
,
and
be
appoint
almost
immediately
to
a
place
about
His
Majesty
's
person
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
with
this
disreputable
nobleman
that
I
contract
an
unluckly
intimacy
;
when
,
fresh
and
unsuspecting
,
I
first
establish
myself
in
town
,
after
my
marriage
with
Lady
Lyndon
:
and
,
as
Crabs
be
really
one
of
the
most
entertaining
fellow
in
the
world
,
I
take
a
sincere
pleasure
in
his
company
;
besides
the
interesting
desire
I
have
in
cultivate
the
society
of
a
man
who
be
so
near
the
person
of
the
high
personage
in
the
realm
.
  
<EOS>
to
hear
the
fellow
,
you
would
fancy
that
there
be
scarce
any
appointment
make
in
which
he
have
not
a
share
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
,
for
instance
,
of
Charles
Fox
be
turn
out
of
his
place
a
day
before
poor
Charley
himself
be
aware
of
the
fact
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
when
the
Howes
be
come
back
from
America
,
and
who
be
to
succeed
to
the
command
there
.
<EOS>
not
to
multiply
instance
,
it
be
upon
this
person
that
I
fix
my
chief
reliance
for
the
advancement
of
my
claim
to
the
Barony
of
Barryogue
and
the
Viscounty
which
I
propose
to
get
.
  
<EOS>
one
of
the
main
cause
of
expense
which
this
ambition
of
mine
entail
upon
me
be
the
fitting
out
and
arm
a
company
of
infantry
from
the
Castle
Lyndon
and
Hackton
estate
in
Ireland
,
which
I
offer
to
my
gracious
Sovereign
for
the
campaign
against
the
american
rebel
.
<EOS>
these
troop
,
superbly
equipped
and
clothe
,
be
embark
at
Portsmouth
in
the
year
1778
;
and
the
patriotism
of
the
gentleman
who
have
raise
them
be
so
acceptable
at
Court
,
that
,
on
be
present
by
my
Lord
North
,
His
Majesty
condescend
to
notice
me
particularly
,
and
say
,
"
that
be
right
,
Mr.
Lyndon
,
raise
another
company
;
and
go
with
them
,
too
!
"
<EOS>
but
this
be
by
no
mean
,
as
the
reader
may
suppose
,
to
my
notion
.
<EOS>
a
man
with
thirty
thousand
pound
per
annum
be
a
fool
to
risk
his
life
like
a
common
beggar
:
<EOS>
and
on
this
account
I
have
always
admire
the
conduct
of
my
friend
Jack
Bolter
,
who
have
be
a
most
active
and
resolute
cornet
of
horse
,
and
,
as
such
,
engage
in
every
scrape
and
skirmish
which
could
fall
to
his
lot
;
but
just
before
the
battle
of
Minden
he
receive
news
that
his
uncle
,
the
great
army
contractor
,
be
dead
,
and
have
leave
him
five
thousand
per
annum
.
<EOS>
Jack
that
instant
apply
for
leave
;
and
,
as
it
be
refuse
him
on
the
eve
of
a
general
action
,
my
gentleman
take
it
,
and
never
fire
a
pistol
again
:
except
against
an
officer
who
question
his
courage
,
and
whom
he
wing
in
such
a
cool
and
determined
manner
,
as
show
all
the
world
that
it
be
from
prudence
and
a
desire
of
enjoy
his
money
,
not
from
cowardice
,
that
he
quit
the
profession
of
arm
.
  
<EOS>
when
this
Hackton
company
be
raise
,
my
stepson
,
who
be
now
sixteen
year
of
age
,
be
most
eager
to
be
allow
to
join
it
,
and
I
would
have
gladly
consent
to
have
be
rid
of
the
young
man
;
but
his
guardian
,
Lord
Tiptoff
,
who
thwart
me
in
everything
,
refuse
his
permission
,
and
the
lad
's
military
inclination
be
balk
.
<EOS>
if
he
could
have
go
on
the
expedition
,
and
a
rebel
rifle
have
put
an
end
to
him
,
I
believe
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
should
not
have
be
grieve
over
-
much
;
and
I
should
have
have
the
pleasure
of
see
my
other
son
the
heir
to
the
estate
which
his
father
have
win
with
so
much
pain
.
  
<EOS>
the
education
of
this
young
nobleman
have
be
,
I
confess
,
some
of
the
loose
;
and
perhaps
the
truth
be
,
I
do
neglect
the
brat
.
<EOS>
He
be
of
so
wild
,
savage
,
and
insubordinate
a
nature
,
that
I
never
have
the
least
regard
for
him
;
and
before
me
and
his
mother
,
at
least
,
be
so
moody
and
dull
,
that
I
think
instruction
throw
away
upon
him
,
and
leave
him
for
the
most
part
to
shift
for
himself
.
<EOS>
for
two
whole
year
he
remain
in
Ireland
away
from
us
;
and
when
in
England
,
we
keep
him
mainly
at
Hackton
,
never
care
to
have
the
uncouth
ungainly
lad
in
the
genteel
company
in
the
capital
in
which
we
naturally
mingle
.
<EOS>
My
own
poor
boy
,
on
the
contrary
,
be
the
most
polite
and
engage
child
ever
see
:
it
be
a
pleasure
to
treat
him
with
kindness
and
distinction
;
and
before
he
be
five
year
old
,
the
little
fellow
be
the
pink
of
fashion
,
beauty
,
and
good
breeding
.
  
<EOS>
in
fact
he
could
not
have
be
otherwise
,
with
the
care
both
his
parent
bestow
upon
him
,
and
the
attention
that
be
lavish
upon
him
in
every
way
.
<EOS>
when
he
be
four
year
old
,
I
quarrel
with
the
english
nurse
who
have
attend
upon
him
,
and
about
whom
my
wife
have
be
so
jealous
,
and
procure
for
him
a
french
gouvernante
,
who
have
live
with
family
of
the
first
quality
in
Paris
;
and
who
,
of
course
,
must
set
my
Lady
Lyndon
jealous
too
.
<EOS>
under
the
care
of
this
young
woman
my
little
rogue
learn
to
chatter
French
most
charmingly
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
do
your
heart
good
to
hear
the
dear
rascal
swear
Mort
de
ma
vie
!
<EOS>
and
to
see
him
stamp
his
little
foot
,
and
send
the
manant
and
canaille
of
the
domestic
to
the
trente
mille
diable
.
<EOS>
He
be
precocious
in
all
thing
:
at
a
very
early
age
he
would
mimic
everybody
;
at
five
,
he
would
sit
at
table
,
and
drink
his
glass
of
champagne
with
the
good
of
us
;
and
his
nurse
would
teach
him
little
french
catch
,
and
the
last
parisian
song
of
Vade
and
Collard
,
 
pretty
song
they
be
too
;
and
would
make
such
of
his
hearer
as
understand
French
burst
with
laughing
,
and
,
<EOS>
I
promise
you
,
scandalise
some
of
the
old
dowager
who
be
admit
into
the
society
of
his
mamma
:
<EOS>
not
that
there
be
many
of
them
;
for
I
do
not
encourage
the
visit
of
what
you
call
respectable
people
to
Lady
Lyndon
.
<EOS>
They
be
sad
spoiler
of
sport
,
 
tale
-
bearer
,
envious
narrow
-
minded
people
;
make
mischief
between
man
and
wife
.
<EOS>
whenever
any
of
these
grave
personage
in
hoop
and
high
heel
use
to
make
their
appearance
at
Hackton
,
or
in
Berkeley
Square
,
it
be
my
chief
pleasure
to
frighten
them
off
;
and
I
would
make
my
little
Bryan
dance
,
sing
,
and
play
the
diable
a
quatre
,
and
aid
him
myself
,
so
as
to
scare
the
old
frump
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
shall
forget
the
solemn
remonstrance
of
our
old
square
-
toe
of
a
rector
at
Hackton
,
who
make
one
or
two
vain
attempt
to
teach
little
Bryan
Latin
,
and
with
whose
innumerable
child
I
sometimes
allow
the
boy
to
associate
.
<EOS>
They
learn
some
of
Bryan
's
french
song
from
him
,
which
their
mother
,
a
poor
soul
who
understand
pickle
and
custard
much
well
than
French
,
use
fondly
to
encourage
them
in
singe
;
but
which
their
father
one
day
hearing
,
he
send
Miss
Sarah
to
her
bedroom
and
bread
and
water
for
a
week
,
and
solemnly
horse
Master
Jacob
in
the
presence
of
all
his
brother
and
sister
,
and
of
Bryan
,
to
whom
he
hope
that
flogging
would
act
as
a
warning
.
<EOS>
but
my
little
rogue
kick
and
plunge
at
the
old
parson
's
shin
until
he
be
oblige
to
get
his
sexton
to
hold
him
down
,
and
swear
,
corbleu
,
morbleu
,
ventrebleu
,
that
his
young
friend
Jacob
should
not
be
maltreat
.
<EOS>
after
this
scene
,
his
reverence
forbid
Bryan
the
rectory
-
house
;
on
which
I
swear
that
his
eld
son
,
who
be
bring
up
for
the
ministry
,
should
never
have
the
succession
of
the
living
of
Hackton
,
which
I
have
thought
of
bestow
on
him
;
and
his
father
say
,
with
a
canting
hypocritical
air
,
which
I
hate
,
that
Heaven
's
will
must
be
do
;
that
he
would
not
have
his
child
disobedient
or
corrupt
for
the
sake
of
a
bishopric
,
and
write
me
a
pompous
and
solemn
letter
,
charge
with
latin
quotation
,
take
farewell
of
me
and
my
house
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
so
with
regret
,
"
add
the
old
gentleman
,
"
for
I
have
receive
so
many
kindness
from
the
Hackton
family
that
it
go
to
my
heart
to
be
disunite
from
them
.
<EOS>
My
poor
,
I
fear
,
may
suffer
in
consequence
of
my
separation
from
you
,
and
my
be
hence
-
forward
unable
to
bring
to
your
notice
instance
of
distress
and
affliction
;
which
,
when
they
be
know
to
you
,
I
will
do
you
the
justice
to
say
,
your
generosity
be
always
prompt
to
relieve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
there
may
have
be
some
truth
in
this
,
for
the
old
gentleman
be
perpetually
pester
me
with
petition
,
and
I
know
for
a
certainty
,
from
his
own
charity
,
be
often
without
a
shilling
in
his
pocket
;
but
I
suspect
the
good
dinner
at
Hackton
have
a
considerable
share
in
cause
his
regret
at
the
dissolution
of
our
intimacy
:
and
I
know
that
his
wife
be
quite
sorry
to
forego
the
acquaintance
of
Bryan
's
gouvernante
,
Mademoiselle
Louison
,
who
have
all
the
new
french
fashion
at
her
finger
'
end
,
and
who
never
go
to
the
rectory
but
you
would
see
the
girl
of
the
family
turn
out
in
new
sack
or
mantle
the
Sunday
after
.
  
<EOS>
I
use
to
punish
the
old
rebel
by
snore
very
loud
in
my
pew
on
Sundays
during
sermon
-
time
;
and
I
get
a
governor
presently
for
Bryan
,
and
a
chaplain
of
my
own
,
when
he
become
of
age
sufficient
to
be
separate
from
the
woman
's
society
and
guardianship
.
<EOS>
His
english
nurse
I
marry
to
my
head
gardener
,
with
a
handsome
portion
;
his
french
gouvernante
I
bestow
upon
my
faithful
German
Fritz
,
not
forget
the
dowry
in
the
latter
instance
;
and
they
set
up
a
french
dining
-
house
in
Soho
,
and
I
believe
at
the
time
I
write
they
be
rich
in
the
world
's
good
than
their
generous
and
free
-
handed
master
.
  
<EOS>
for
Bryan
I
now
get
a
young
gentleman
from
Oxford
,
the
Rev.
Edmund
Lavender
,
who
be
commission
to
teach
him
Latin
,
when
the
boy
be
in
the
humour
,
and
to
ground
him
in
history
,
grammar
,
and
the
other
qualification
of
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Lavender
be
a
precious
addition
to
our
society
at
Hackton
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
mean
of
make
a
deal
of
fun
there
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
butt
of
all
our
joke
,
and
bear
them
with
the
most
admirable
and
martyrlike
patience
.
<EOS>
He
be
one
of
that
sort
of
man
who
would
rather
be
kick
by
a
great
man
than
not
be
notice
by
him
;
and
I
have
often
put
his
wig
into
the
fire
in
the
face
of
the
company
,
when
he
would
laugh
at
the
joke
as
well
as
any
man
there
.
<EOS>
It
be
a
delight
to
put
him
on
a
high
-
mettled
horse
,
and
send
him
after
the
hound
,
 
pale
,
sweating
,
call
on
us
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
to
stop
,
and
hold
on
for
dear
life
by
the
mane
and
the
crupper
.
<EOS>
how
it
happen
that
the
fellow
be
never
kill
I
know
not
;
but
I
suppose
hang
be
the
way
in
which
his
neck
will
be
break
.
<EOS>
He
never
meet
with
any
accident
,
to
speak
of
,
in
our
hunting
-
match
:
but
you
be
pretty
sure
to
find
him
at
dinner
in
his
place
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
make
the
punch
,
whence
he
would
be
carry
off
fuddle
to
bed
before
the
night
be
over
.
<EOS>
many
a
time
have
Bryan
and
I
paint
his
face
black
on
those
occasion
.
<EOS>
We
put
him
into
a
haunted
room
,
and
frighten
his
soul
out
of
his
body
with
ghost
;
we
let
loose
cargo
of
rat
upon
his
bed
;
we
cry
fire
,
and
fill
his
boot
with
water
;
we
cut
the
leg
of
his
preaching
-
chair
,
and
fill
his
sermon
-
book
with
snuff
.
<EOS>
poor
Lavender
bore
it
all
with
patience
;
and
at
our
party
,
or
when
we
come
to
London
,
be
amply
repay
by
be
allow
to
sit
with
the
gentlefolk
,
and
to
fancy
himself
in
the
society
of
man
of
fashion
.
<EOS>
It
be
good
to
hear
the
contempt
with
which
he
talk
about
our
rector
.
"
<EOS>
He
have
a
son
,
sir
,
who
be
a
servitor
:
and
a
servitor
at
a
small
college
,
"
he
would
say
.
<EOS>
"
how
COULD
you
,
my
dear
sir
,
think
of
give
the
reversion
of
Hackton
to
such
a
low
-
breed
creature
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
should
now
speak
of
my
other
son
,
at
least
my
Lady
Lyndon
's
:
I
mean
the
Viscount
Bullingdon
.
<EOS>
I
keep
him
in
Ireland
for
some
year
,
under
the
guardianship
of
my
mother
,
whom
I
have
instal
at
Castle
Lyndon
;
and
great
<EOS>
,
I
promise
you
,
be
her
state
in
that
occupation
,
and
prodigious
the
good
soul
's
splendour
and
haughty
bearing
.
<EOS>
with
all
her
oddity
,
the
Castle
Lyndon
estate
be
the
good
manage
of
all
our
possession
;
the
rent
be
excellently
pay
,
the
charge
of
get
them
in
small
than
they
would
have
be
under
the
management
of
any
steward
.
<EOS>
It
be
astonishing
what
small
expense
the
good
widow
incur
;
although
she
keep
up
the
dignity
of
the
two
family
,
as
she
would
say
.
<EOS>
She
have
a
set
of
domestic
to
attend
upon
the
young
lord
;
she
never
go
out
herself
but
in
an
old
gilt
coach
and
six
;
the
house
be
keep
clean
and
tight
;
the
furniture
and
garden
in
the
good
repair
;
and
,
<EOS>
in
our
occasional
visit
to
Ireland
,
we
never
find
any
house
we
visit
in
such
good
condition
as
our
own
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
score
of
ready
serving
-
lass
,
and
half
as
many
trim
man
about
the
castle
;
and
everything
in
as
fine
condition
as
the
good
housekeeper
could
make
it
.
<EOS>
all
this
she
do
with
scarcely
any
charge
to
us
:
for
she
feed
sheep
and
cattle
in
the
park
,
and
make
a
handsome
profit
of
them
at
Ballinasloe
;
she
supply
I
do
not
know
how
many
town
with
butter
and
bacon
;
and
the
fruit
and
vegetable
from
the
garden
of
Castle
Lyndon
get
the
high
price
in
Dublin
market
.
<EOS>
She
have
no
waste
in
the
kitchen
,
as
there
use
to
be
in
most
of
our
irish
house
;
and
there
be
no
consumption
of
liquor
in
the
cellar
,
for
the
old
lady
drank
water
,
and
see
little
or
no
company
.
<EOS>
all
her
society
be
a
couple
of
the
girl
of
my
ancient
flame
Nora
Brady
,
now
Mrs.
Quin
;
who
with
her
husband
have
spend
almost
all
their
property
,
and
who
come
to
see
me
once
in
London
,
look
very
old
,
fat
,
and
slatternly
,
with
two
dirty
child
at
her
side
.
<EOS>
She
weep
very
much
when
she
see
me
,
call
me
"
Sir
,
"
and
"
Mr.
Lyndon
,
"
at
which
I
be
not
sorry
,
and
beg
me
to
help
her
husband
;
which
I
do
,
get
him
,
through
my
friend
Lord
Crabs
,
a
place
in
the
excise
in
Ireland
,
and
pay
the
passage
of
his
family
and
himself
to
that
country
.
<EOS>
I
find
him
a
dirty
,
cast
-
down
,
snivel
drunkard
;
and
,
look
at
poor
Nora
,
could
not
but
wonder
at
the
day
when
I
have
think
her
a
divinity
.
<EOS>
but
if
ever
I
have
have
a
regard
for
a
woman
,
I
remain
through
life
her
constant
friend
,
and
could
mention
a
thousand
such
instance
of
my
generous
and
faithful
disposition
.
  
<EOS>
Young
Bullingdon
,
however
,
be
almost
the
only
person
with
whom
she
be
concerned
that
my
mother
could
not
keep
in
order
.
<EOS>
the
account
she
send
me
of
him
at
first
be
such
as
give
my
paternal
heart
considerable
pain
.
<EOS>
He
reject
all
regularity
and
authority
.
<EOS>
He
would
absent
himself
for
week
from
the
house
on
sporting
or
other
expedition
.
<EOS>
He
be
when
at
home
silent
and
queer
,
refuse
to
make
my
mother
's
game
at
piquet
of
evening
,
but
plunge
into
all
sort
of
musty
old
book
,
with
which
he
muddle
his
brain
;
more
at
ease
laughing
and
chat
with
the
piper
and
maid
in
the
servant
'
hall
,
than
with
the
gentry
in
the
drawing
-
room
;
always
cut
jibe
and
joke
at
Mrs.
Barry
,
at
which
she
(
who
be
rather
a
slow
woman
at
repartee
)
would
chafe
violently
:
in
fact
,
lead
a
life
of
insubordination
and
scandal
.
<EOS>
and
,
to
crown
all
,
the
young
scapegrace
take
to
frequent
the
society
of
the
romish
priest
of
the
parish
 
a
threadbare
rogue
,
from
some
popish
seminary
in
France
or
Spain
 
rather
than
the
company
of
the
vicar
of
Castle
Lyndon
,
a
gentleman
of
Trinity
,
who
keep
his
hound
and
drink
his
two
bottle
a
day
.
  
<EOS>
regard
for
the
lad
's
religion
make
me
not
hesitate
then
how
I
should
act
towards
him
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
any
principle
which
have
guide
me
through
life
,
it
have
be
respect
for
the
Establishment
,
and
a
hearty
scorn
and
abhorrence
of
all
other
form
of
belief
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
send
my
french
body
-
servant
,
in
the
year
17
 
,
to
Dublin
with
a
commission
to
bring
the
young
reprobate
over
;
and
the
report
bring
to
me
be
that
he
have
pass
the
whole
of
the
last
night
of
his
stay
in
Ireland
with
his
popish
friend
at
the
mass
-
house
;
that
he
and
my
mother
have
a
violent
quarrel
on
the
very
last
day
;
that
,
on
the
contrary
,
he
kiss
Biddy
and
Dosy
,
her
two
niece
,
who
seem
very
sorry
that
he
should
go
;
and
that
be
press
to
go
and
visit
the
rector
,
he
absolutely
refuse
,
say
he
be
a
wicked
old
Pharisee
,
inside
whose
door
he
would
never
set
his
foot
.
<EOS>
the
doctor
write
me
a
letter
,
warn
me
against
the
deplorable
error
of
this
young
imp
of
perdition
,
as
he
call
him
;
and
I
could
see
that
there
be
no
love
lose
between
them
.
<EOS>
but
it
appear
that
,
if
not
agreeable
to
the
gentry
of
the
country
,
young
Bullingdon
have
a
huge
popularity
among
the
common
people
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
regular
crowd
weeping
round
the
gate
when
his
coach
take
its
departure
.
<EOS>
score
of
the
ignorant
savage
wretch
run
for
mile
along
by
the
side
of
the
chariot
;
and
some
go
even
so
far
as
to
steal
away
before
his
departure
,
and
appear
at
the
Pigeon
-
House
at
Dublin
to
bid
him
a
last
farewell
.
<EOS>
It
be
with
considerable
difficulty
that
some
of
these
people
could
be
keep
from
secrete
themselves
in
the
vessel
,
and
accompany
their
young
lord
to
England
.
  
<EOS>
to
do
the
young
scoundrel
justice
,
when
he
come
among
us
,
he
be
a
manly
noble
-
look
lad
,
and
everything
in
his
bearing
and
appearance
betoken
the
high
blood
from
which
he
come
.
<EOS>
He
be
the
very
portrait
of
some
of
the
dark
cavalier
of
the
Lyndon
race
,
whose
picture
hang
in
the
gallery
at
Hackton
:
where
the
lad
be
fond
of
spend
the
chief
part
of
his
time
,
occupy
with
the
musty
old
book
which
he
take
out
of
the
library
,
and
which
I
hate
to
see
a
young
man
of
spirit
pore
over
.
<EOS>
always
in
my
company
he
preserve
the
most
rigid
silence
,
and
a
haughty
scornful
demeanour
;
which
be
so
much
the
more
disagreeable
because
there
be
nothing
in
his
behaviour
I
could
actually
take
hold
of
to
find
fault
with
:
although
his
whole
conduct
be
insolent
and
supercilious
to
the
high
degree
.
<EOS>
His
mother
be
very
much
agitate
at
receive
him
on
his
arrival
;
if
he
feel
any
such
agitation
he
certainly
do
not
show
it
.
<EOS>
He
make
her
a
very
low
and
formal
bow
when
he
kiss
her
hand
;
and
,
when
I
hold
out
mine
,
put
both
his
hand
behind
his
back
,
stare
me
full
in
the
face
,
and
bend
his
head
,
say
,
"
Mr.
Barry
Lyndon
,
I
believe
;
"
turn
on
his
heel
,
and
begin
talk
about
the
state
of
the
weather
to
his
mother
,
whom
he
always
style
"
Your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
"
She
be
angry
at
this
pert
bearing
,
and
,
when
they
be
alone
,
rebuke
him
sharply
for
not
shake
hand
with
his
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
,
madam
?
"
<EOS>
say
he
;
<EOS>
"
surely
you
mistake
.
<EOS>
My
father
be
the
right
honourable
Sir
Charles
Lyndon
.
<EOS>
_
I
<EOS>
_
at
least
have
not
forget
him
,
if
other
have
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
a
declaration
of
war
to
me
,
as
I
see
at
once
;
though
I
declare
I
be
willing
enough
to
have
receive
the
boy
well
on
his
come
amongst
us
,
and
to
have
live
with
him
on
term
of
friendliness
.
<EOS>
but
as
man
serve
me
I
serve
them
.
<EOS>
who
can
blame
me
for
my
after
-
quarrel
with
this
young
reprobate
,
or
lie
upon
my
shoulder
the
evil
which
afterwards
befell
?
<EOS>
perhaps
I
lose
my
temper
,
and
my
subsequent
treatment
of
him
be
hard
.
<EOS>
but
it
be
he
begin
the
quarrel
,
and
not
I
;
and
the
evil
consequence
which
ensue
be
entirely
of
his
creating
.
  
<EOS>
as
it
be
good
to
nip
vice
in
the
bud
,
and
for
a
master
of
a
family
to
exercise
his
authority
in
such
a
manner
as
that
there
may
be
no
question
about
it
,
I
take
the
early
opportunity
of
come
to
close
quarter
with
Master
Bullingdon
;
and
the
day
after
his
arrival
among
us
,
upon
his
refusal
to
perform
some
duty
which
I
request
of
him
,
I
have
him
convey
to
my
study
,
and
thrash
him
soundly
.
<EOS>
this
process
,
I
confess
,
at
first
agitate
me
a
good
deal
,
for
I
have
never
lay
a
whip
on
a
lord
before
;
but
I
get
speedily
use
to
the
practice
,
and
his
back
and
my
whip
become
so
well
acquaint
,
that
I
warrant
there
be
very
little
CEREMONY
between
us
after
a
while
.
  
<EOS>
if
I
be
to
repeat
all
the
instance
of
the
insubordination
and
brutal
conduct
of
young
Bullingdon
,
I
should
weary
the
reader
.
<EOS>
His
perseverance
in
resistance
be
,
I
think
,
even
great
than
mine
in
correct
him
:
for
a
man
,
be
he
ever
so
much
resolve
to
do
his
duty
as
a
parent
,
can
not
be
flog
his
child
all
day
,
or
for
every
fault
they
commit
:
and
though
I
get
the
character
of
be
so
cruel
a
stepfather
to
him
,
I
pledge
my
word
I
spare
him
correction
when
he
merit
it
many
more
time
than
I
administer
it
.
<EOS>
besides
,
there
be
eight
clear
month
in
the
year
when
he
be
quit
of
me
,
during
the
time
of
my
presence
in
London
,
at
my
place
in
Parliament
,
and
at
the
Court
of
my
Sovereign
.
  
<EOS>
at
this
period
I
make
no
difficulty
to
allow
him
to
profit
by
the
latin
and
Greek
of
the
old
rector
;
who
have
christen
him
,
and
have
a
considerable
influence
over
the
wayward
lad
.
<EOS>
after
a
scene
or
a
quarrel
between
us
,
it
be
generally
to
the
rectory
-
house
that
the
young
rebel
would
fly
for
refuge
and
counsel
;
and
I
must
own
that
the
parson
be
a
pretty
just
umpire
between
us
in
our
dispute
.
<EOS>
once
he
lead
the
boy
back
to
Hackton
by
the
hand
,
and
actually
bring
him
into
my
presence
,
although
he
have
vow
never
to
enter
the
door
in
my
lifetime
again
,
and
say
,
"
He
have
bring
his
lordship
to
acknowledge
his
error
,
and
submit
to
any
punishment
I
may
think
proper
to
inflict
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
upon
which
I
cane
him
in
the
presence
of
two
or
three
friend
of
mine
,
with
whom
I
be
sit
drink
at
the
time
;
and
to
do
him
justice
,
he
bear
a
pretty
severe
punishment
without
wince
or
cry
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
this
will
show
that
I
be
not
too
severe
in
my
treatment
of
the
lad
,
as
I
have
the
authority
of
the
clergyman
himself
for
inflict
the
correction
which
I
think
proper
.
  
<EOS>
twice
or
thrice
,
Lavender
,
Bryan
's
governor
,
attempt
to
punish
my
Lord
Bullingdon
;
but
I
promise
you
the
rogue
be
too
strong
for
him
,
and
level
the
Oxford
man
to
the
ground
with
a
chair
:
greatly
to
the
delight
of
little
Byran
,
who
cry
out
,
"
Bravo
,
Bully
!
<EOS>
thump
him
,
thump
him
!
"
<EOS>
and
Bully
certainly
do
,
to
the
governor
's
heart
's
content
;
who
never
attempt
personal
chastisement
afterwards
;
but
content
himself
by
bring
the
tale
of
his
lordship
's
misdoing
to
me
,
his
natural
protector
and
guardian
.
  
<EOS>
with
the
child
,
Bullingdon
be
,
strange
to
say
,
pretty
tractable
.
<EOS>
He
take
a
liking
for
the
little
fellow
,
 
as
,
indeed
,
everybody
who
see
that
darling
boy
do
,
 
like
him
the
more
,
he
say
,
because
he
be
"
half
a
Lyndon
.
"
<EOS>
and
well
he
may
like
him
<EOS>
,
for
many
a
time
,
at
the
dear
angel
's
intercession
of
"
Papa
,
do
not
flog
Bully
to
-
day
!
<EOS>
"
I
have
hold
my
hand
,
and
save
him
a
horsing
,
which
he
richly
deserve
.
  
<EOS>
with
his
mother
,
at
first
,
he
would
scarcely
deign
to
have
any
communication
.
<EOS>
He
say
she
be
no
longer
one
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
why
should
he
love
her
,
as
she
have
never
be
a
mother
to
him
?
<EOS>
but
it
will
give
the
reader
an
idea
of
the
dogged
obstinacy
and
surliness
of
the
lad
's
character
,
when
I
mention
one
trait
regard
him
.
<EOS>
It
have
be
make
a
matter
of
complaint
against
me
,
that
I
deny
him
the
education
befit
a
gentleman
,
and
never
send
him
to
college
or
to
school
;
but
the
fact
be
,
it
be
of
his
own
choice
that
he
go
to
neither
.
<EOS>
He
have
the
offer
repeatedly
from
me
(
who
wish
to
see
as
little
of
his
impudence
as
possible
)
,
but
he
as
repeatedly
decline
;
and
,
for
a
long
time
,
I
could
not
make
out
what
be
the
charm
which
keep
him
in
a
house
where
he
must
have
be
far
from
comfortable
.
  
<EOS>
It
come
out
,
however
,
at
last
.
<EOS>
there
use
to
be
very
frequent
dispute
between
my
Lady
Lyndon
and
myself
,
in
which
sometimes
she
be
wrong
,
sometimes
I
be
;
and
which
,
as
neither
of
us
have
very
angelical
temper
,
use
to
run
very
high
.
<EOS>
I
be
often
in
liquor
;
and
when
in
that
condition
,
what
gentleman
be
master
of
himself
?
<EOS>
perhaps
I
do
,
in
this
state
,
use
my
Lady
rather
roughly
;
fle
a
glass
or
two
at
her
,
and
call
her
by
a
few
name
that
be
not
complimentary
.
<EOS>
I
may
have
threaten
her
life
(
which
it
be
obviously
my
interest
not
to
take
)
,
and
have
frighten
her
,
in
a
word
,
considerably
.
  
<EOS>
after
one
of
these
dispute
,
in
which
she
run
scream
through
the
gallery
,
and
I
,
as
tipsy
as
a
lord
,
come
stagger
after
,
it
appear
Bullingdon
be
attract
out
of
his
room
by
the
noise
;
as
I
come
up
with
her
,
the
audacious
rascal
trip
up
my
heel
,
which
be
not
very
steady
,
and
catch
his
faint
mother
in
his
arm
,
take
her
into
his
own
room
;
where
he
,
upon
her
entreaty
,
swear
he
would
never
leave
the
house
as
long
as
she
continue
unite
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
of
the
vow
,
or
indeed
of
the
tipsy
frolic
which
be
the
occasion
of
it
;
I
be
take
up
"
glorious
,
"
as
the
phrase
be
,
by
my
servant
,
and
put
to
bed
,
and
,
in
the
morning
,
have
no
more
recollection
of
what
have
occur
any
more
than
of
what
happen
when
I
be
a
baby
at
the
breast
.
<EOS>
Lady
Lyndon
tell
me
of
the
circumstance
year
after
;
and
I
mention
it
here
,
as
it
enable
me
to
plead
honourably
"
not
guilty
"
to
one
of
the
absurd
charge
of
cruelty
trump
up
against
me
with
respect
to
my
stepson
.
<EOS>
let
my
detractor
apologise
,
if
they
dare
,
for
the
conduct
of
a
graceless
ruffian
who
trip
up
the
heel
of
his
own
natural
guardian
and
stepfather
after
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
this
circumstance
serve
to
unite
mother
and
son
for
a
little
;
but
their
character
be
too
different
.
<EOS>
I
believe
she
be
too
fond
of
me
ever
to
allow
him
to
be
sincerely
reconcile
to
her
.
<EOS>
as
he
grow
up
to
be
a
man
,
his
hatred
towards
me
assume
an
intensity
quite
wicked
to
think
of
(
and
<EOS>
which
I
promise
you
I
return
with
interest
)
:
and
it
be
at
the
age
of
sixteen
,
I
think
,
that
the
impudent
young
hangdog
,
on
my
return
from
Parliament
one
summer
,
and
on
my
proposing
to
cane
him
as
usual
,
give
me
to
understand
that
he
would
submit
to
no
farther
chastisement
from
me
,
and
say
,
grind
his
tooth
,
that
he
would
shoot
me
if
I
lay
hand
on
him
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
him
;
he
be
grow
,
in
fact
,
to
be
a
tall
young
man
,
and
I
give
up
that
necessary
part
of
his
education
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
about
this
time
that
I
raise
the
company
which
be
to
serve
in
America
;
and
my
enemy
in
the
country
(
and
since
my
victory
over
the
tiptoff
<EOS>
I
scarce
need
say
I
have
many
of
them
)
<EOS>
begin
to
propagate
the
most
shameful
report
regard
my
conduct
to
that
precious
young
scapegrace
my
stepson
,
and
to
insinuate
that
I
actually
wish
to
get
rid
of
him
.
<EOS>
thus
my
loyalty
to
my
sovereign
be
actually
construe
into
a
horrid
unnatural
attempt
on
my
part
on
Bullingdon
's
life
;
and
it
be
say
that
I
have
raise
the
american
corp
for
the
sole
purpose
of
get
the
young
Viscount
to
command
it
,
and
so
of
get
rid
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
be
not
sure
that
they
have
not
fix
upon
the
name
of
the
very
man
in
the
company
who
be
order
to
despatch
him
at
the
first
general
action
,
and
the
bribe
I
be
to
give
him
for
this
delicate
piece
of
service
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
truth
be
,
I
be
of
opinion
then
<EOS>
(
and
though
the
fulfilment
of
my
prophecy
have
be
delay
,
yet
I
make
no
doubt
it
will
be
bring
to
pass
ere
long
)
,
that
my
Lord
Bullingdon
need
none
of
my
aid
in
send
him
into
the
other
world
;
but
have
a
happy
knack
of
find
the
way
thither
himself
,
which
he
would
be
sure
to
pursue
.
<EOS>
in
truth
,
he
begin
upon
this
way
early
:
of
all
the
violent
,
daring
,
disobedient
scapegrace
that
ever
cause
an
affectionate
parent
pain
,
he
be
certainly
the
most
incorrigible
;
there
be
no
beat
him
,
or
coax
him
,
or
tame
him
.
  
<EOS>
for
instance
,
with
my
little
son
,
when
his
governor
bring
him
into
the
room
as
we
be
over
the
bottle
after
dinner
,
my
Lord
would
begin
his
violent
and
undutiful
sarcasm
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
dear
child
,
"
he
would
say
,
begin
to
caress
and
fondle
him
,
"
what
a
pity
<EOS>
it
be
I
be
not
dead
for
thy
sake
!
<EOS>
the
Lyndons
would
then
have
a
worthy
representative
,
and
enjoy
all
the
benefit
of
the
illustrious
blood
of
the
Barrys
of
Barryogue
;
would
they
not
,
Mr.
Barry
Lyndon
?
"
<EOS>
He
always
choose
the
day
when
company
,
or
the
clergy
or
gentry
of
the
neighbourhood
,
be
present
,
to
make
these
insolent
speech
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
another
day
(
it
be
Bryan
's
birthday
)
<EOS>
we
be
give
a
grand
ball
and
gala
at
Hackton
,
and
it
be
time
for
my
little
Bryan
to
make
his
appearance
among
us
,
as
he
usually
do
in
the
smart
little
court
-
suit
you
ever
see
(
ah
me
!
<EOS>
but
it
bring
tear
into
my
old
eye
now
to
think
of
the
bright
look
of
that
darle
little
face
)
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
great
crowding
and
titter
when
the
child
come
in
,
lead
by
his
half
-
brother
,
who
walk
into
the
dancing
-
room
(
would
you
believe
it
?
)
<EOS>
in
his
stocking
-
foot
,
lead
little
Bryan
by
the
hand
,
paddle
about
in
the
great
shoe
of
the
elder
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
do
not
you
think
he
fit
my
shoe
very
well
,
Sir
Richard
Wargrave
?
"
say
the
young
reprobate
:
upon
which
the
company
begin
to
look
at
each
other
and
to
titter
;
and
his
mother
,
come
up
to
Lord
Bullingdon
with
great
dignity
,
seize
the
child
to
her
breast
,
and
say
,
"
from
the
manner
in
which
I
love
this
child
,
my
Lord
,
you
ought
to
know
how
I
would
have
love
his
eld
brother
have
he
prove
worthy
of
any
mother
's
affection
!
"
<EOS>
and
,
burst
into
tear
,
Lady
Lyndon
leave
the
apartment
,
and
the
young
lord
rather
discomfit
for
once
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
on
one
occasion
,
his
behaviour
to
me
be
so
outrageous
(
it
be
in
the
hunting
-
field
and
in
a
large
public
company
)
,
that
I
lose
all
patience
,
ride
at
the
urchin
straight
,
wrench
him
out
of
his
saddle
with
all
my
force
,
and
,
fling
him
roughly
to
the
ground
,
spring
down
to
it
myself
,
and
administer
such
a
correction
across
the
young
caitiff
's
head
and
shoulder
with
my
horsewhip
as
may
have
end
in
his
death
,
have
I
not
be
restrain
in
time
;
for
my
passion
be
up
,
and
I
be
in
a
state
to
do
murder
or
any
other
crime
.
<EOS>
the
lad
be
take
home
and
put
to
bed
,
where
he
lie
for
a
day
or
two
in
a
fever
,
as
much
from
rage
and
vexation
as
from
the
chastisement
I
have
give
him
;
and
three
day
afterwards
,
on
send
to
inquire
at
his
chamber
whether
he
would
join
the
family
at
table
,
a
note
be
find
on
his
table
,
and
his
bed
be
empty
and
cold
.
<EOS>
the
young
villain
have
flee
,
and
have
the
audacity
to
write
in
the
follow
term
regard
me
to
my
wife
,
his
mother
:
    
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
"
he
say
,
"
I
have
bear
as
long
as
mortal
could
endure
the
ill
-
treatment
of
the
insolent
irish
upstart
whom
you
have
take
to
your
bed
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
only
the
lowness
of
his
birth
and
the
general
brutality
of
his
manner
which
disgust
me
,
and
must
make
me
hate
him
so
long
as
I
have
the
honour
to
bear
the
name
of
Lyndon
,
which
he
be
unworthy
of
,
but
the
shameful
nature
of
his
conduct
towards
your
ladyship
;
his
brutal
and
ungentlemanlike
behaviour
,
his
open
infidelity
,
his
habit
of
extravagance
,
intoxication
,
his
shameless
robbery

swindling
of
my
property

your

It
be
these
insult
to
you
which
shock
and
annoy
me
,
more
than
the
ruffian
's
infamous
conduct
to
myself
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
stand
by
your
Ladyship
as
I
promise
,
but
you
seem
to
have
take
latterly
your
husband
's
part
;
and
,
as
I
can
not
personally
chastise
this
low
-
breed
ruffian
,
who
,
to
our
shame
be
it
speak
,
be
the
husband
of
my
mother
;
and
as
I
can
not
bear
to
witness
his
treatment
of
you
,
and
loathe
his
horrible
society
as
if
it
be
the
plague
,
I
be
determined
to
quit
my
native
country
:
at
least
during
his
detest
life
,
or
during
my
own

<EOS>
I
possess
a
small
income
from
my
father
,
of
which
I
have
no
doubt
<EOS>
Mr.
Barry
will
cheat
me
if
he

which
,
if
your

some
feeling

you
will

award
to
me

Messrs.

would
not

rob
on
the
highway

shall
try

find
out
some
way
in

more
honourable

and
all
the
neighbour
vow
that
I
have
be
privy
to
his
flight

would
profit
by
it
;
though
I
declare
on
my
honour
my
true

sincere

after
read
the
above
infamous
letter
,
be
to

a
good
arm

there
be
no

this
idea
from

It

fate

audacious
young
truant

after
some
fifteen
month

I
have
the
pleasure
of
be
able
to
refute
some
of
the
murderous
calumny
which
have

utter
against

Lord

Sukey
Capermore
have
a
love
of
dancing
which
would
make
her
dance
at
a
funeral
if
anybody
ask
her
,
and
I
have
too
much
spirit
to
give
in
at
this
signal
instance
of
insult
towards
me
;
so
we
dance
with
some
of
the
very
commonest
low
people
at
the
bottom
of
the
set
 
your
apothecary
,
wine
-
merchant
,
attorney
,
and
such
scum
as
be
allow
to
attend
our
public
assembly
.
  
<EOS>
the
bishop
,
my
Lady
Lyndon
's
relative
,
neglect
to
invite
us
to
the
palace
at
the
assize
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
every
indignity
be
put
upon
me
which
could
by
possibility
be
heap
upon
an
innocent
and
honourable
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
My
reception
in
London
,
whither
I
now
carry
my
wife
and
family
,
be
scarcely
more
cordial
.
<EOS>
on
pay
my
respect
to
my
Sovereign
at
St.
James
's
,
His
Majesty
pointedly
ask
me
when
I
have
news
of
Lord
Bullingdon
.
<EOS>
on
which
I
reply
,
with
no
ordinary
presence
of
mind
,
"
Sir
,
my
Lord
Bullingdon
be
fight
the
rebel
against
your
Majesty
's
crown
in
America
.
<EOS>
do
your
Majesty
desire
that
I
should
send
another
regiment
to
aid
him
?
"
<EOS>
on
which
the
King
turn
on
his
heel
,
and
I
make
my
bow
out
of
the
presence
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
when
Lady
Lyndon
kiss
the
Queen
's
hand
at
the
drawing
-
room
,
I
find
that
precisely
the
same
question
have
be
put
to
her
ladyship
;
and
she
come
home
much
agitate
at
the
rebuke
which
have
be
administer
to
her
.
<EOS>
thus
it
be
that
my
loyalty
be
reward
,
and
<EOS>
my
sacrifice
,
in
favour
of
my
country
,
view
!
<EOS>
I
take
away
my
establishment
abruptly
to
Paris
,
where
I
meet
with
a
very
different
reception
:
but
my
stay
amidst
the
enchanting
pleasure
of
that
capital
be
extremely
short
;
for
the
french
Government
,
which
have
be
long
tamper
with
the
american
rebel
,
now
openly
acknowledge
the
independence
of
the
United
States
.
<EOS>
a
declaration
of
war
ensue
:
all
we
happy
English
be
order
away
from
Paris
;
and
I
think
I
leave
one
or
two
fair
lady
there
inconsolable
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
only
place
where
a
gentleman
can
live
as
he
like
without
be
incommode
by
his
wife
.
<EOS>
the
Countess
and
I
,
during
our
stay
,
scarcely
see
each
other
except
upon
public
occasion
,
at
Versailles
,
or
at
the
Queen
's
play
-
table
;
and
our
dear
little
Bryan
advance
in
a
thousand
elegant
accomplishment
which
render
him
the
delight
of
all
who
know
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
not
forget
to
mention
here
my
last
interview
with
my
good
uncle
,
the
Chevalier
de
Ballybarry
,
whom
I
leave
at
Brussels
with
strong
intention
of
make
his
salut
,
as
the
phrase
be
,
and
who
have
go
into
retirement
at
a
convent
there
.
<EOS>
since
then
he
have
come
into
the
world
again
,
much
to
his
annoyance
and
repentance
;
have
fall
desperately
in
love
in
his
old
age
with
a
french
actress
,
who
have
do
,
as
most
lady
of
her
character
do
,
 
ruin
him
,
leave
him
,
and
laugh
at
him
.
<EOS>
His
repentance
be
very
edifying
.
<EOS>
under
the
guidance
of
Messieurs
of
the
Irish
College
,
he
once
more
turn
his
thought
towards
religion
;
and
his
only
prayer
to
me
when
I
see
him
and
ask
in
what
I
could
relieve
him
,
be
to
pay
a
handsome
fee
to
the
convent
into
which
he
propose
to
enter
.
  
<EOS>
this
I
could
not
,
of
course
,
do
:
<EOS>
my
religious
principle
forbid
me
to
encourage
superstition
in
any
way
;
and
the
old
gentleman
and
I
part
rather
coolly
,
in
consequence
of
my
refusal
,
as
he
say
,
to
make
his
old
day
comfortable
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
very
poor
at
the
time
,
that
be
the
fact
;
and
entre
nous
,
the
Rosemont
of
the
French
Opera
,
an
indifferent
dancer
,
but
a
charming
figure
and
ankle
,
be
ruin
me
in
diamond
,
equipage
,
and
furniture
bill
,
add
to
which
I
have
a
run
of
ill
-
luck
at
play
,
and
be
force
to
meet
my
loss
by
the
most
shameful
sacrifice
to
the
money
-
lender
,
by
pawn
part
of
Lady
Lyndon
's
diamond
(
that
graceless
little
Rosemont
wheedle
me
out
of
some
of
them
)
,
and
by
a
thousand
other
scheme
for
raise
money
.
<EOS>
but
when
Honour
be
in
the
case
,
be
I
ever
find
backward
at
her
call
:
and
what
man
can
say
that
Barry
Lyndon
lose
a
bet
which
he
do
not
pay
?
  
<EOS>
as
for
my
ambitious
hope
regard
the
irish
peerage
,
I
begin
,
on
my
return
,
to
find
out
that
I
have
be
lead
wildly
astray
by
that
rascal
Lord
Crabs
;
who
like
to
take
my
money
,
but
have
no
more
influence
to
get
me
a
coronet
than
to
procure
for
me
the
Pope
's
tiara
.
<EOS>
the
Sovereign
be
not
a
whit
more
gracious
to
me
on
return
from
the
Continent
than
he
have
be
before
my
departure
;
and
I
have
it
from
one
of
the
aide
-
de
-
camp
of
the
Royal
duke
his
brother
,
that
my
conduct
and
amusement
at
Paris
have
be
odiously
misrepresent
by
some
spy
there
,
and
have
form
the
subject
of
royal
comment
;
and
that
the
King
have
,
influence
by
these
calumny
,
actually
say
I
be
the
most
disreputable
man
in
the
three
kingdom
.
<EOS>
I
disreputable
!
<EOS>
I
a
dishonour
to
my
name
and
country
!
<EOS>
when
I
hear
these
falsehood
,
I
be
in
such
a
rage
that
I
go
off
to
Lord
North
at
once
to
remonstrate
with
the
Minister
;
to
insist
upon
be
allow
to
appear
before
His
Majesty
and
clear
myself
of
the
imputation
against
me
,
to
point
out
my
service
to
the
Government
in
vote
with
them
,
and
to
ask
when
the
reward
that
have
be
promise
to
me
 
viz
.
<EOS>
,
the
title
hold
by
my
ancestor
 
be
again
to
be
revive
in
my
person
?
  
<EOS>
there
be
a
sleepy
coolness
in
that
fat
Lord
North
which
be
the
most
provoking
thing
that
the
Opposition
have
ever
to
encounter
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
hear
me
with
half
-
shut
eye
.
<EOS>
when
I
have
finish
a
long
violent
speech
 
which
I
make
stride
about
his
room
in
Downing
Street
,
and
gesticulate
with
all
the
energy
of
an
Irishman
 
<EOS>
he
open
one
eye
,
smile
,
and
ask
me
gently
if
I
have
do
.
<EOS>
on
my
replying
in
the
affirmative
,
he
say
,
"
well
,
Mr.
Barry
,
I
will
answer
you
,
point
by
point
.
<EOS>
the
King
be
exceedingly
averse
to
make
peer
,
as
you
know
.
<EOS>
Your
claim
,
as
you
call
them
,
have
be
lay
before
him
,
and
His
Majesty
's
gracious
reply
be
,
that
you
be
the
most
impudent
man
in
his
dominion
,
and
merit
a
halter
rather
than
a
coronet
.
<EOS>
as
for
withdraw
your
support
from
us
,
you
be
perfectly
welcome
to
carry
yourself
and
your
vote
whithersoever
<EOS>
you
please
.
<EOS>
and
now
,
as
I
have
a
great
deal
of
occupation
,
perhaps
you
will
do
me
the
favour
to
retire
.
"
<EOS>
so
say
,
he
raise
his
hand
lazily
to
the
bell
,
and
bow
me
out
;
ask
blandly
if
there
be
any
other
thing
in
the
world
in
which
he
could
oblige
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
home
in
a
fury
which
can
not
be
describe
;
and
have
Lord
Crabs
to
dinner
that
day
,
assail
his
lordship
by
pull
his
wig
off
his
head
,
and
smother
it
in
his
face
,
and
by
attack
him
in
that
part
of
the
person
where
,
accord
to
report
,
he
have
be
formerly
assault
by
Majesty
.
<EOS>
the
whole
story
be
over
the
town
the
next
day
,
and
picture
of
me
be
hang
in
the
club
and
print
-
shop
perform
the
operation
allude
to
.
<EOS>
all
the
town
laugh
at
the
picture
of
the
lord
and
the
Irishman
,
and
,
I
need
not
say
,
recognise
both
.
<EOS>
as
for
me
,
I
be
one
of
the
most
celebrated
character
in
London
in
those
day
:
my
dress
,
style
,
and
equipage
be
as
well
know
as
those
of
any
leader
of
the
fashion
;
and
my
popularity
,
if
not
great
in
the
high
quarter
,
be
at
least
considerable
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
the
people
cheer
me
in
the
Gordon
row
,
at
the
time
they
nearly
kill
my
friend
Jemmy
Twitcher
and
burn
Lord
Mansfield
's
house
down
.
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
be
know
as
a
staunch
Protestant
,
and
after
my
quarrel
with
Lord
North
veer
right
round
to
the
opposition
,
and
vex
him
with
all
the
mean
in
my
power
.
  
<EOS>
these
be
not
,
unluckily
,
very
great
,
for
I
be
a
bad
speaker
,
and
the
House
would
not
listen
to
me
,
and
presently
,
in
1780
,
after
the
Gordon
disturbance
,
be
dissolve
,
when
a
general
election
take
place
.
<EOS>
It
come
on
me
,
as
all
my
mishap
be
in
the
habit
of
come
,
at
a
most
unlucky
time
.
<EOS>
I
be
oblige
to
raise
more
money
,
at
most
ruinous
rate
,
to
face
the
confound
election
,
and
have
the
Tiptoffs
against
me
in
the
field
more
active
and
virulent
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
My
blood
boil
even
now
when
I
think
of
the
rascally
conduct
of
my
enemy
in
that
scoundrelly
election
.
<EOS>
I
be
hold
up
as
the
Irish
Bluebeard
,
and
libel
of
me
be
print
,
and
gross
caricature
draw
represent
me
flog
Lady
Lyndon
,
whip
Lord
Bullingdon
,
turn
him
out
of
door
in
a
storm
,
and
I
know
not
what
.
<EOS>
there
be
picture
of
a
pauper
cabin
in
Ireland
,
from
which
it
be
pretend
I
come
;
other
in
which
I
be
represent
as
a
lacquey
and
shoeblack
.
<EOS>
a
flood
of
calumny
be
let
loose
upon
me
,
in
which
any
man
of
less
spirit
would
have
go
down
.
  
<EOS>
but
though
I
meet
my
accuser
boldly
,
though
I
lavish
sum
of
money
in
the
election
,
though
I
fling
open
Hackton
Hall
and
keep
champagne
and
Burgundy
run
there
,
and
at
all
my
inn
in
the
town
,
as
commonly
as
water
,
the
election
go
against
me
.
<EOS>
the
rascally
gentry
have
all
turn
upon
me
and
join
the
Tiptoff
faction
:
it
be
even
represent
that
I
hold
my
wife
by
force
;
and
though
I
send
her
into
the
town
alone
,
wear
my
colour
,
with
Bryan
in
her
lap
,
and
make
her
visit
the
mayor
's
lady
and
the
chief
woman
there
,
nothing
would
persuade
the
people
but
that
she
live
in
fear
and
tremble
of
me
;
and
the
brutal
mob
have
the
insolence
to
ask
her
why
she
dare
to
go
back
,
and
how
she
like
horsewhip
for
supper
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
throw
out
of
my
election
,
and
all
the
bill
come
down
upon
me
together
 
all
the
bill
I
have
be
contract
during
the
year
of
my
marriage
,
which
the
creditor
,
with
a
rascally
unanimity
,
send
in
until
they
lay
upon
my
table
in
heap
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
cite
their
amount
:
it
be
frightful
.
<EOS>
My
steward
and
lawyer
make
matter
bad
.
<EOS>
I
be
bind
up
in
an
inextricable
toil
of
bill
and
debt
,
of
mortgage
and
insurance
,
and
all
the
horrible
evil
attendant
upon
them

<EOS>
lawyer

composition
after

and
Lady

irretrievably
to

these
cormorant

<EOS>
to
do
her
justice
,
she
behave
with
tolerable
kindness
at
this
season
of
trouble
;
for
whenever
I
want
money
I
have
to
coax
her
,
and
whenever
I
coax
her
<EOS>
I
be
sure
of
bring
this
weak
and
light
-
minded
woman
to
good
-
humour
:
who
be
of
such
a
weak
terrified
nature

that
to
secure
an
easy
week
with
me
<EOS>
she
would
sign
away
a
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
and
when
my
trouble
begin
at
Hackton
,
and
I

on
the
only
chance
leave

viz

<EOS>
to
retire
to
Ireland
and
retrench
,
assign
over
the
good
part
of
my

to
the
creditor
until
their
demand
be
meet
,
my
Lady
be
quite
cheerful
at
the
idea
of
go
,
and
say
,
if
we
would
be
quiet
,
she
have
no
doubt
all
would
be
well
;
indeed
,
be
glad
to
undergo
the
comparative
poverty
in
which
we
must
now
live
for
the
sake
of
the
retirement
and
the
chance
of
domestic
quiet
which
she
hope
to
enjoy
.
  
<EOS>
We
go
off
to
Bristol
pretty
suddenly
,
leave
the
odious
and
ungrateful
wretch
at
Hackton
to
vilify
us
,
no
doubt
,
in
our
absence
.
<EOS>
My
stud
and
hound
be
sell
off
immediately
;
the
harpy
would
have
be
glad
to
pounce
upon
my
person
;
but
that
be
out
of
their
power
.
<EOS>
I
have
raise

by
cleverness
and
management
,
to
the
full
as
much
on
my
mine
and
private
estate
as
they

so
the
scoundrel
be
disappoint
in
this
instance
;
and
as
for
the
plate
and
property
in
the
London
house
,
they
could
not
touch
that
,
as
it
be
the
property
of
the
heir
of
the
house
of
Lyndon
.
  
<EOS>
I
pass
over
to
Ireland
,
then
,
and
take
up
my
abode
at
Castle
Lyndon
for
a
while
;
all
the

imagine
that
I
be
an
utterly
ruin
man

and
that

Barry

would
never
again
appear
in
the

he

an
ornament

it

not

<EOS>
for

and
I

forthwith
the
title
of

the
third

the

title
.
<EOS>
My
mother
go
almost
mad
with
joy
at

and
I
feel
that
all

to
such
a
post
of

conclusion
 
if

of
a
race
of
ungrateful
scoundrel

who

your
prosperity
while
it
last

and
,
even
when
gorge
with
your
venison
and
Burgundy
,
abuse
the
generous
giver
of
the
feast
<EOS>
,
I
be
sure
I
merit
a
good
name
and
a
high
reputation
:
in
Ireland
,
at
least
,
where
my
generosity
be
unbounded
,
and
the
splendour
of
my
mansion
and
entertainment
unequalle
by
any
other
nobleman
of
my
time
.
<EOS>
as
long
as
my
magnificence
last
,
all
the
country
be
free
to
partake
of
it
;
I
have
hunter
sufficient
in
my
stable
to
mount
a
regiment
of
dragoon
,
and
butts
of
wine
in
my
cellar
which
would
have
make
whole
county
drink
for
year
.
<EOS>
Castle
Lyndon
become
the
headquarters
of
score
of
needy
gentleman
,
and
I
never
ride
a
-
hunting
<EOS>
but
I
have
a
dozen
young
fellow
of
the
good
blood
of
the
country
ride
as
my
squire
and
gentleman
of
the
horse
.
<EOS>
My
son
,
little
Castle
Lyndon
,
be
a
prince
;
his
breeding
and
manner
,
even
at
his
early
age
,
show
him
to
be
worthy
of
the
two
noble
family
from
whom
he
be
descend
:
I
do
not
know
what
high
hope
I
have
for
the
boy
,
and
indulge
in
a
thousand
fond
anticipation
as
to
his
future
success
and
figure
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
but
stern
Fate
have
determine
that
I
should
leave
none
of
my
race
behind
me
,
and
ordain
that
I
should
finish
my
career
,
as
I
see
it
close
now
 
poor
,
lonely
,
and
childless
.
<EOS>
I
may
have
have
my
fault
;
but
no
man
shall
dare
to
say
of
me
that
I
be
not
a
good
and
tender
father
.
<EOS>
I
love
that
boy
passionately
;
perhaps
with
a
blind
partiality
:
I
deny
him
nothing
.
<EOS>
gladly
,
gladly
,
I
swear
,
<EOS>
would
I
have
die
that
his
premature
doom
may
have
be
avert
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
be
not
a
day
since
I
lose
him
but
<EOS>
his
bright
face
and
beautiful
smile
look
down
on
me
out
of
heaven
,
where
he
be
,
and
that
my
heart
do
not
yearn
towards
him
.
<EOS>
that
sweet
child
be
take
from
me
at
the
age
of
nine
year
,
when
he
be
full
of
beauty
and
promise
:
and
so
powerful
be
the
hold
his
memory
have
of
me
that
I
have
never
be
able
to
forget
him
;
his
little
spirit
haunt
me
of
night
on
my
restless
solitary
pillow
;
many
a
time
,
in
the
wildest
and
maddest
company
,
as
the
bottle
be
go
round
,
and
the
song
and
laugh
roar
about
<EOS>
,
I
be
think
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
get
a
lock
of
his
soft
brown
hair
hang
round
my
breast
now
:
it
will
accompany
me
to
the
dishonoured
pauper
's
grave
;
where
soon
,
no
doubt
,
Barry
Lyndon
's
wear
-
out
old
bone
will
be
lay
.
  
<EOS>
My
Bryan
be
a
boy
of
amazing
high
spirit
<EOS>
(
indeed
how
,
come
from
such
a
stock
,
could
he
be
otherwise
?
)
,
impatient
even
of
my
control
,
against
which
the
dear
little
rogue
would
often
rebel
gallantly
;
how
much
more
,
then
,
of
his
mother
's
and
the
woman
's
,
whose
attempt
to
direct
him
he
would
laugh
to
scorn
.
<EOS>
even
my
own
mother
(
"
Mrs
.
Barry
of
Lyndon
"
the
good
soul
now
call
herself
,
in
compliment
to
my
new
family
)
be
quite
unable
to
check
him
;
and
hence
you
may
fancy
what
a
will
he
have
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
if
it
have
not
be
for
that
,
he
may
have
live
to
this
day
:
<EOS>
he
may
 
but
why
repine
?
<EOS>
be
he
not
in
a
well
place
?
<EOS>
would
the
heritage
of
a
beggar
do
any
service
to
him
?
<EOS>
It
be
good
as
it
be
 
Heaven
be
good
to
us
!
 
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
that
I
,
his
father
,
should
be
leave
to
deplore
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
in
the
month
of
October
<EOS>
I
have
be
to
Dublin
,
in
order
to
see
a
lawyer
and
a
moneyed
man
who
have
come
over
to
Ireland
to
consult
with
me
about
some
sale
of
mine
and
the
cut
of
Hackton
timber
;
of
which
,
as
I
hate
the
place
and
be
greatly
in
want
of
money
,
I
be
determined
to
cut
down
every
stick
.
<EOS>
there
have
be
some
difficulty
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
It
be
say
I
have
no
right
to
touch
the
timber
.
<EOS>
the
brute
peasantry
about
the
estate
have
be
rouse
to
such
a
pitch
of
hatred
against
me
,
that
the
rascal
actually
refuse
to
lay
an
axe
to
the
tree
;
and
my
agent
(
that
scoundrel
Larkins
)
declare
that
his
life
be
in
danger
among
them
if
he
attempt
any
further
despoilment
(
as
they
call
it
)
of
the
property
.
<EOS>
every
article
of
the
splendid
furniture
be
sell
by
this
time
,
as
I
need
not
say
;
and
as
for
the
plate
,
I
have
take
good
care
to
bring
it
off
to
Ireland
,
where
it
now
be
in
the
good
of
keep
 
my
banker
's
,
who
have
advance
six
thousand
pound
on
it
:
which
sum
<EOS>
I
soon
have
occasion
for
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
to
Dublin
,
then
,
to
meet
the
english
man
of
business
;
and
so
far
succeed
in
persuade
Mr.
Splint
,
a
great
shipbuilder
and
timber
-
dealer
of
Plymouth
,
of
my
claim
to
the
Hackton
timber
,
that
he
agree
to
purchase
it
off
-
hand
at
about
one
-
third
of
its
value
,
and
hand
me
over
five
thousand
pound
:
which
,
be
press
with
debt
at
the
time
,
I
be
fain
to
accept
.
<EOS>
he
have
no
difficulty
in
get
down
the
wood
,
I
warrant
.
<EOS>
He
take
a
regiment
of
shipwright
and
sawyer
from
his
own
and
the
King
's
yard
at
Plymouth
,
and
in
two
month
Hackton
Park
be
as
bare
of
tree
as
the
Bog
of
Allen
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
but
<EOS>
ill
luck
with
that
accurse
expedition
and
money
.
<EOS>
I
lose
the
great
part
of
it
in
two
night
'
play
at
"
Daly
's
,
"
so
that
my
debt
stand
just
as
they
be
before
;
and
before
the
vessel
sail
for
Holyhead
,
which
carry
away
my
old
sharper
of
a
timber
-
merchant
,
all
that
I
have
leave
of
the
money
he
bring
me
be
a
couple
of
hundred
pound
,
with
which
I
return
home
very
disconsolately
:
and
very
suddenly
,
too
,
for
my
Dublin
tradesman
be
hot
upon
me
,
hear
I
have
spend
the
loan
,
and
two
of
my
wine
-
merchant
have
writ
out
against
me
for
some
thousand
of
pound
.
  
<EOS>
I
buy
in
Dublin
,
accord
to
my
promise
,
however
 
for
when
I
give
a
promise
I
will
keep
it
at
any
sacrifice
 
a
little
horse
for
my
dear
little
Bryan
;
which
be
to
be
a
present
for
his
tenth
birthday
,
that
be
now
come
on
:
it
be
a
beautiful
little
animal
and
stand
me
in
a
good
sum
.
<EOS>
I
never
regard
money
for
that
dear
child
.
<EOS>
but
the
horse
be
very
wild
.
<EOS>
He
kick
off
one
of
my
horse
-
boy
,
who
ride
him
at
first
,
and
break
the
lad
's
leg
;
and
,
though
I
take
the
animal
in
hand
on
the
journey
home
,
it
be
only
my
weight
and
skill
that
make
the
brute
quiet
.
  
<EOS>
when
we
get
home
<EOS>
I
send
the
horse
away
with
one
of
my
groom
to
a
farmer
's
house
,
to
break
him
thoroughly
in
,
and
tell
Bryan
,
who
be
all
anxiety
to
see
his
little
horse
,
that
he
would
arrive
by
his
birthday
,
when
he
should
hunt
him
along
with
my
hound
;
and
I
promise
myself
no
small
pleasure
in
present
the
dear
fellow
to
the
field
that
day
:
which
I
hope
to
see
him
lead
some
time
or
other
in
place
of
his
fond
father
.
<EOS>
ah
me
!
<EOS>
never
be
that
gallant
boy
to
ride
a
fox
-
chase
,
or
to
take
the
place
amongst
the
gentry
of
his
country
which
his
birth
and
genius
have
point
out
for
him
!
  
<EOS>
though
I
do
not
believe
in
dream
and
omen
,
yet
I
can
not
but
own
that
when
a
great
calamity
be
hang
over
a
man
he
have
frequently
many
strange
and
awful
foreboding
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
now
I
have
many
.
<EOS>
Lady
Lyndon
,
especially
,
twice
dream
of
her
son
's
death
;
<EOS>
but
,
as
she
be
now
grow
uncommonly
nervous
and
vapourish
,
I
treat
her
fear
with
scorn
,
and
my
own
,
of
course
,
too
.
<EOS>
and
in
an
unguarded
moment
,
over
the
bottle
after
dinner
,
I
tell
poor
Bryan
,
who
be
always
question
me
about
the
little
horse
,
and
when
it
be
to
come
,
that
it
be
arrive
;
that
it
be
in
Doolan
's
farm
,
where
Mick
the
groom
be
break
him
in
.
"
<EOS>
promise
me
,
Bryan
,
"
scream
his
mother
,
"
that
you
will
not
ride
the
horse
except
in
company
of
your
father
.
"
<EOS>
but
I
only
say
,
"
Pooh
,
madam
,
you
be
an
ass
!
"
<EOS>
be
angry
at
her
silly
timidity
,
which
be
always
show
itself
in
a
thousand
disagreeable
way
now
;
and
,
turn
round
to
Bryan
,
say
,
"
I
promise
your
lordship
a
good
flogging
if
you
mount
him
without
my
leave
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
poor
child
do
not
care
about
pay
this
penalty
for
the
pleasure
<EOS>
he
be
to
have
,
or
possibly
think
a
fond
father
would
remit
the
punishment
altogether
;
for
the
next
morning
,
when
I
rise
rather
late
,
have
sit
up
drink
the
night
before
,
I
find
the
child
have
be
off
at
daybreak
,
have
slipt
through
his
tutor
's
room
(
this
be
Redmond
Quin
,
our
cousin
,
whom
I
have
take
to
live
with
me
)
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
but
that
he
be
go
to
Doolan
's
farm
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
a
great
horsewhip
and
gallop
off
after
him
in
a
rage
,
swear
I
would
keep
my
promise
.
<EOS>
but
,
Heaven
forgive
me
!
<EOS>
I
little
think
of
it
when
at
three
mile
from
home
I
meet
a
sad
procession
come
towards
me
:
peasant
moan
and
howl
as
our
Irish
do
,
<EOS>
the
black
horse
lead
by
the
hand
,
and
,
on
a
door
that
some
of
the
folk
carry
,
my
poor
dear
dear
little
boy
.
<EOS>
there
he
lie
in
his
little
boot
and
spur
,
and
his
little
coat
of
scarlet
and
gold
.
<EOS>
His
dear
face
be
quite
white
,
and
he
smile
as
he
hold
a
hand
out
to
me
,
and
say
painfully
,
"
You
will
not
whip
me
,
will
you
,
papa
?
<EOS>
"
I
could
only
burst
out
into
tear
in
reply
.
<EOS>
I
have
see
many
and
many
a
man
die
,
and
there
be
a
look
about
the
eye
which
you
can
not
mistake
.
<EOS>
there
be
a
little
drummer
-
boy
<EOS>
I
be
fond
of
who
be
hit
down
before
my
company
at
Kuhnersdorf
;
when
I
run
up
to
give
him
some
water
,
he
look
exactly
like
my
dear
Bryan
<EOS>
then
do
 
<EOS>
there
be
no
mistaking
<EOS>
that
awful
look
of
the
eye
.
<EOS>
We
carry
him
home
and
scour
the
country
round
for
doctor
to
come
and
look
at
his
hurt
.
  
<EOS>
but
what
do
a
doctor
avail
in
a
contest
with
the
grim
invincible
enemy
?
<EOS>
such
as
come
could
only
confirm
our
despair
by
their
account
of
the
poor
child
's
case
.
<EOS>
He
have
mount
his
horse
gallantly
,
sit
him
bravely
all
the
time
the
animal
plunge
and
kick
,
and
,
have
overcome
his
first
spite
,
run
him
at
a
hedge
by
the
roadside
.
<EOS>
but
there
be
loose
stone
at
the
top
,
and
the
horse
's
foot
catch
among
them
,
and
he
and
his
brave
little
rider
roll
over
together
at
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
the
people
say
they
see
the
noble
little
boy
spring
up
after
his
fall
and
run
to
catch
the
horse
;
which
have
break
away
from
him
,
kick
him
on
the
back
,
as
it
would
seem
,
as
they
lie
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
poor
Bryan
run
a
few
yard
and
then
drop
down
as
if
shot
.
<EOS>
a
pallor
come
over
his
face
,
and
they
think
he
be
dead
.
<EOS>
but
they
pour
whisky
down
his
mouth
,
and
the
poor
child
revive
:
<EOS>
still
he
could
not
move
;
his
spine
be
injure
;
the
low
half
of
him
be
dead
when
they
lay
him
in
bed
at
home
.
<EOS>
the
rest
do
not
last
long
,
God
help
me
!
<EOS>
He
remain
yet
for
two
day
with
us
;
and
a
sad
comfort
it
be
to
think
he
be
in
no
pain
.
  
<EOS>
during
this
time
the
dear
angel
's
temper
seem
quite
to
change
:
he
ask
his
mother
and
me
pardon
for
any
act
of
disobedience
he
have
be
guilty
of
towards
us
;
he
say
often
he
should
like
to
see
his
brother
Bullingdon
.
<EOS>
"
Bully
be
well
than
you
,
papa
,
"
he
say
;
"
he
use
not
to
swear
so
,
and
he
tell
and
teach
me
many
good
thing
while
you
be
away
.
"
<EOS>
and
,
take
a
hand
of
his
mother
and
mine
in
each
of
his
little
clammy
one
,
he
beg
us
not
to
quarrel
so
,
but
love
each
other
,
so
that
we
may
meet
again
in
heaven
,
where
Bully
tell
him
quarrelsome
people
never
go
.
<EOS>
His
mother
be
very
much
affect
by
these
admonition
from
the
poor
suffering
angel
's
mouth
;
and
I
be
so
too
.
<EOS>
I
wish
she
have
enable
me
to
keep
the
counsel
which
the
die
boy
give
us
.
  
<EOS>
at
last
,
after
two
day
,
he
die
.
<EOS>
there
he
lie
,
the
hope
of
my
family
,
the
pride
of
my
manhood
,
the
link
which
have
keep
me
and
my
Lady
Lyndon
together
.
<EOS>
"
oh
,
Redmond
,
"
say
she
,
kneel
by
the
sweet
child
's
body
,
"
do
,
do
let
us
listen
to
the
truth
out
of
his
bless
mouth
:
and
do
you
amend
your
life
,
and
treat
your
poor
loving
fond
wife
as
her
die
child
bade
you
.
"
<EOS>
and
I
say
I
would
:
<EOS>
but
there
be
promise
which
it
be
out
of
a
man
's
power
to
keep
;
especially
with
such
a
woman
as
her
.
<EOS>
but
we
draw
together
after
that
sad
event
,
and
be
for
several
month
well
friend
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
tell
you
with
what
splendour
we
bury
him
.
<EOS>
of
what
avail
be
undertaker
'
feather
and
herald
'
trumpery
?
<EOS>
I
go
out
and
shoot
the
fatal
black
horse
that
have
kill
him
,
at
the
door
of
the
vault
where
we
lay
my
boy
.
<EOS>
I
be
so
wild
,
that
I
could
have
shoot
myself
too
.
<EOS>
but
for
the
crime
,
it
would
have
be
well
that
I
should
,
perhaps
;
for
what
have
my
life
be
since
that
sweet
flower
be
take
out
of
my
bosom
?
<EOS>
a
succession
of
misery
,
wrong
,
disaster
,
and
mental
and
bodily
suffering
which
never
fall
to
the
lot
of
any
other
man
in
Christendom
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Lyndon
,
always
vapourish
and
nervous
,
after
our
bless
boy
's
catastrophe
become
more
agitated
than
ever
,
and
plunge
into
devotion
with
so
much
fervour
,
that
you
would
have
fancy
her
almost
distract
at
time
.
<EOS>
She
imagine
she
see
vision
.
<EOS>
She
say
an
angel
from
heaven
have
tell
her
that
Bryan
's
death
be
as
a
punishment
to
her
for
her
neglect
of
her
first
-
bear
.
<EOS>
then
she
would
declare
Bullingdon
be
alive
;
she
have
see
him
in
a
dream
.
<EOS>
then
again
she
would
fall
into
fit
of
sorrow
about
his
death
,
and
grieve
for
him
as
violently
as
if
he
have
be
the
last
of
her
son
who
have
die
,
and
not
our
darle
Bryan
;
who
,
compare
to
Bullingdon
,
be
what
a
diamond
be
to
a
vulgar
stone
.
<EOS>
Her
freak
be
painful
to
witness
,
and
difficult
to
control
.
<EOS>
It
begin
to
be
say
in
the
country
that
the
Countess
be
go
mad
.
<EOS>
My
scoundrelly
enemy
do
not
fail
to
confirm
and
magnify
the
rumour
,
and
would
add
that
I
be
the
cause
of
her
insanity
:
I
have
drive
her
to
distraction
<EOS>
,
I
have
kill
Bullingdon
,
I
have
murder
my
own
son
;
I
do
not
know
what
else
they
lay
to
my
charge
.
<EOS>
even
in
Ireland
their
hateful
calumny
reach
me
:
my
friend
fall
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
They
begin
to
desert
my
hunt
,
as
they
do
in
England
,
and
when
I
go
to
race
or
market
find
sudden
reason
for
get
out
of
my
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
I
get
the
name
of
Wicked
Barry
,
Devil
Lyndon
,
which
you
please
:
the
country
-
folk
use
to
make
marvellous
legend
about
me
:
the
priest
say
I
have
massacre
I
do
not
know
how
many
german
nun
in
the
seven
year
'
war
;
that
the
ghost
of
the
murder
Bullingdon
haunt
my
house
.
<EOS>
once
at
a
fair
in
a
town
hard
by
,
when
I
have
a
mind
to
buy
a
waistcoat
for
one
of
my
people
,
a
fellow
standing
by
say
,
"
'
Tis
<EOS>
a
strait
-
waistcoat
<EOS>
he
be
buy
for
my
Lady
Lyndon
.
"
<EOS>
and
from
this
circumstance
arise
a
legend
of
my
cruelty
to
my
wife
;
and
many
circumstantial
detail
be
narrate
regard
my
manner
and
ingenuity
of
torture
her
.
  
<EOS>
the
loss
of
my
dear
boy
press
not
only
on
my
heart
as
a
father
,
but
injure
my
individual
interest
in
a
very
considerable
degree
;
for
as
there
be
now
no
direct
heir
to
the
estate
,
and
Lady
Lyndon
be
of
a
weak
health
,
and
suppose
to
be
quite
unlikely
to
leave
a
family
,
the
next
in
succession
-
that
detestable
family
of
Tiptoff
 
begin
to
exert
themselves
in
a
hundred
way
to
annoy
me
,
and
be
at
the
head
of
the
party
of
enemy
who
be
raise
report
to
my
discredit
.
<EOS>
They
interpose
between
me
and
my
management
of
the
property
in
a
hundred
different
way
;
make
an
outcry
if
I
cut
a
stick
,
sunk
a
shaft
,
sell
a
picture
,
or
send
a
few
ounce
of
plate
to
be
remodelle
.
<EOS>
They
harass
me
with
ceaseless
lawsuit
,
get
injunction
from
Chancery
,
hamper
my
agent
in
the
execution
of
their
work
;
so
much
so
that
you
would
have
fancy
my
own
be
not
my
own
,
but
theirs
,
to
do
as
they
like
with
.
<EOS>
what
be
bad
,
as
I
have
reason
to
believe
,
they
have
tampering
and
dealing
with
my
own
domestic
under
my
own
roof
;
for
I
could
not
have
a
word
with
Lady
Lyndon
<EOS>
but
it
somehow
get
abroad
,
and
I
could
not
be
drunk
with
my
chaplain
and
friend
but
some
sanctify
rascal
would
get
hold
of
the
news
,
and
reckon
up
all
the
bottle
I
drink
and
all
the
oath
I
swear
.
<EOS>
that
these
be
not
few
,
I
acknowledge
.
<EOS>
I
be
of
the
old
school
;
be
always
a
free
liver
and
speaker
;
and
,
at
least
,
if
I
do
and
say
what
I
like
,
be
not
so
bad
as
many
a
canting
scoundrel
I
know
of
who
cover
his
foible
and
sin
,
unsuspecte
,
with
a
mask
of
holiness
.
<EOS>
as
I
be
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
,
and
be
no
hypocrite
,
I
may
as
well
confess
now
that
I
endeavour
to
ward
off
the
device
of
my
enemy
by
an
artifice
which
be
not
,
perhaps
,
strictly
justifiable
.
<EOS>
everything
depend
on
my
have
an
heir
to
the
estate
;
for
if
Lady
Lyndon
,
who
be
of
weakly
health
,
have
die
,
the
next
day
I
be
a
beggar
:
all
my
sacrifice
of
money
,
&
c.
,
on
the
estate
would
not
have
be
hold
in
a
farthing
's
account
;
all
the
debt
would
have
be
leave
on
my
shoulder
;
and
my
enemy
would
have
triumph
over
me
:
<EOS>
which
,
to
a
man
of
my
honourable
spirit
,
be
"
the
unkind
cut
of
all
,
"
as
some
poet
say
.
  
<EOS>
I
confess
,
then
,
it
be
my
wish
to
supplant
these
scoundrel
;
and
,
as
I
could
not
do
so
without
an
heir
to
my
property
,
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
_
determined
to
find
one
.
<EOS>
if
I
have
him
near
at
hand
,
and
of
my
own
blood
too
,
though
with
the
bar
sinister
,
be
not
here
the
question
.
<EOS>
It
be
then
I
find
out
the
rascally
machination
of
my
enemy
;
for
,
have
broach
this
plan
to
Lady
Lyndon
,
whom
I
make
to
be
,
outwardly
at
least
,
the
most
obedient
of
wife
,
 
although
I
never
let
a
letter
from
her
or
to
her
go
or
arrive
without
my
inspection
,
 
although
I
allow
her
to
see
none
but
those
person
who
I
think
,
in
her
delicate
health
,
would
be
fitting
society
for
her
;
yet
the
infernal
Tiptoffs
get
wind
of
my
scheme
,
protest
instantly
against
it
,
not
only
by
letter
,
but
in
the
shameful
libellous
public
print
,
and
hold
me
up
to
public
odium
as
a
"
child
-
forger
,
"
as
they
call
me
.
<EOS>
of
course
I
deny
the
charge
 
<EOS>
I
could
do
no
otherwise
,
and
offer
to
meet
any
one
of
the
Tiptoffs
on
the
field
of
honour
,
and
prove
him
a
scoundrel
and
a
liar
:
as
he
be
;
though
,
perhaps
,
not
in
this
instance
.
<EOS>
but
they
content
themselves
by
answer
me
by
a
lawyer
,
and
decline
an
invitation
which
any
man
of
spirit
would
have
accept
.
<EOS>
My
hope
of
have
an
heir
be
thus
blight
completely
:
indeed
,
Lady
Lyndon
(
though
,
as
I
have
say
,
I
take
her
opposition
for
nothing
)
<EOS>
have
resist
the
proposal
with
as
much
energy
as
a
woman
of
her
weakness
could
manifest
;
and
say
she
have
commit
one
great
crime
in
consequence
of
me
,
but
would
rather
die
than
perform
another
.
<EOS>
I
could
easily
have
bring
her
ladyship
to
her
sense
,
however
:
but
my
scheme
have
take
wind
,
and
it
be
now
in
vain
to
attempt
it
.
<EOS>
We
may
have
have
a
dozen
child
in
honest
wedlock
,
and
people
would
have
say
they
be
false
.
  
<EOS>
as
for
raise
money
on
annuity
,
I
may
say
I
have
use
her
life
interest
up
.
<EOS>
there
be
but
few
of
those
assurance
society
in
my
time
which
have
since
spring
up
in
the
city
of
London
;
underwriter
do
the
business
,
and
my
wife
's
life
be
as
well
known
among
them
<EOS>
as
,
I
do
believe
,
that
of
any
woman
in
Christendom
.
<EOS>
latterly
,
when
I
want
to
get
a
sum
against
her
life
,
the
rascal
have
the
impudence
to
say
my
treatment
of
her
do
not
render
it
worth
a
year
's
purchase
,
 
as
if
my
interest
lie
in
kill
her
!
<EOS>
have
my
boy
live
,
it
would
have
be
a
different
thing
;
he
and
his
mother
may
have
cut
off
the
entail
of
a
good
part
of
the
property
between
them
,
and
my
affair
have
be
put
in
well
order
.
<EOS>
now
they
be
in
a
bad
condition
indeed
.
<EOS>
all
my
scheme
have
turn
out
failure
;
my
land
,
which
I
have
purchase
with
borrow
money
,
make
me
no
return
,
and
I
be
oblige
to
pay
ruinous
interest
for
the
sum
with
which
I
have
purchase
them
.
<EOS>
My
income
,
though
very
large
,
be
saddle
with
hundred
of
annuity
,
and
thousand
of
lawyer
'
charge
;
and
I
feel
the
net
drawing
closer
and
close
round
me
,
and
no
means
to
extricate
myself
from
its
toil
.
  
<EOS>
to
add
to
all
my
perplexity
,
two
year
after
my
poor
child
's
death
,
my
wife
,
whose
vagary
of
temper
and
wayward
folly
I
have
bear
with
for
twelve
year
,
want
to
leave
me
,
and
absolutely
make
attempt
at
what
she
call
escape
from
my
tyranny
.
  
<EOS>
My
mother
,
who
be
the
only
person
that
,
in
my
misfortune
,
remain
faithful
to
me
(
indeed
,
she
have
always
speak
of
me
in
my
true
light
,
as
a
martyr
to
the
rascality
of
other
and
a
victim
of
my
own
generous
and
confide
temper
)
,
find
out
the
first
scheme
that
be
go
on
;
and
of
which
those
artful
and
malicious
tiptoff
be
,
as
usual
,
the
main
promoter
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Barry
,
indeed
,
though
her
temper
be
violent
and
her
way
singular
,
be
an
invaluable
person
to
me
in
my
house
;
which
would
have
be
at
rack
and
ruin
long
before
,
but
for
her
spirit
of
order
and
management
,
and
for
her
excellent
economy
in
the
government
of
my
numerous
family
.
<EOS>
as
for
my
Lady
Lyndon
,
she
,
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
be
much
too
fine
a
lady
to
attend
to
household
matter
 
<EOS>
pass
her
day
with
her
doctor
,
or
her
book
of
piety
,
and
never
appear
among
us
except
at
my
compulsion
;
when
she
and
my
mother
would
be
sure
to
have
a
quarrel
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Barry
,
on
the
contrary
,
have
a
talent
for
management
in
all
matter
.
<EOS>
She
keep
the
maid
stir
,
and
the
footman
to
their
duty
;
have
an
eye
over
the
claret
in
the
cellar
,
and
the
oats
and
hay
in
the
stable
;
see
to
the
salt
and
pickle
,
the
potato
and
the
turf
-
stack
,
the
pig
-
killing
and
the
poultry
,
the
linen
-
room
and
the
bakehouse
,
and
the
ten
thousand
minutia
of
a
great
establishment
.
<EOS>
if
all
irish
housewife
be
like
her
,
I
warrant
many
a
hall
-
fire
would
be
blaze
where
the
cobwebs
only
grow
now
,
and
many
a
park
cover
with
sheep
and
fat
cattle
where
the
thistle
be
at
present
the
chief
occupier
.
<EOS>
if
anything
could
have
save
me
from
the
consequence
of
villainy
in
other
,
and
(
I
confess
it
,
for
I
be
not
above
own
to
my
fault
)
<EOS>
my
own
too
easy
,
generous
,
and
careless
nature
,
it
would
have
be
the
admirable
prudence
of
that
worthy
creature
.
<EOS>
She
never
go
to
bed
until
all
the
house
be
quiet
and
all
the
candle
out
;
and
you
may
fancy
that
this
be
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
with
a
man
of
my
habit
,
who
have
commonly
a
dozen
of
jovial
fellow
(
artful
scoundrel
and
false
friend
most
of
them
be
!
)
<EOS>
to
drink
with
me
every
night
,
and
who
seldom
,
for
my
part
,
go
to
bed
sober
.
<EOS>
many
and
many
a
night
,
when
I
be
unconscious
of
her
attention
,
have
that
good
soul
pull
my
boot
off
,
and
see
me
lay
by
my
servant
snug
in
bed
,
and
carry
off
the
candle
herself
;
and
be
the
first
in
the
morning
,
too
,
to
bring
me
my
drink
of
small
-
beer
.
<EOS>
mine
be
no
milksop
time
,
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
a
gentleman
think
no
shame
of
take
his
half
-
dozen
bottle
;
and
,
as
for
your
coffee
and
slop
,
they
be
leave
to
Lady
Lyndon
,
her
doctor
,
and
the
other
old
woman
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
mother
's
pride
that
I
could
drink
more
than
any
man
in
the
country
,
 
as
much
,
within
a
pint
,
as
my
father
before
me
,
she
say
.
  
<EOS>
that
Lady
Lyndon
should
detest
her
be
quite
natural
.
<EOS>
She
be
not
the
first
of
woman
or
mankind
either
that
have
hate
a
mother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
I
set
my
mother
to
keep
a
sharp
watch
over
the
freak
of
her
Ladyship
;
and
this
,
you
may
be
sure
,
<EOS>
be
one
of
the
reason
why
the
latter
dislike
her
.
<EOS>
I
never
mind
that
,
however
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Barry
's
assistance
and
surveillance
be
invaluable
to
me
;
and
,
if
I
have
pay
twenty
spy
to
watch
my
Lady
,
I
should
not
have
be
half
so
well
serve
as
by
the
disinterested
care
and
watchfulness
of
my
excellent
mother
.
<EOS>
She
sleep
with
the
house
-
key
under
her
pillow
,
and
have
an
eye
everywhere
.
<EOS>
She
follow
all
the
Countess
's
movement
like
a
shadow
;
she
manage
to
know
,
from
morning
to
night
,
everything
that
my
Lady
do
.
<EOS>
if
she
walk
in
the
garden
,
a
watchful
eye
be
keep
on
the
wicket
;
and
if
she
choose
to
drive
out
,
Mrs.
Barry
accompany
her
,
and
a
couple
of
fellow
in
my
livery
ride
alongside
of
the
carriage
to
see
that
she
come
to
no
harm
.
<EOS>
though
she
object
,
and
would
have
keep
her
room
in
sullen
silence
,
I
make
a
point
that
we
should
appear
together
at
church
in
the
coach
-
and
-
six
every
Sunday
;
and
that
she
should
attend
the
race
-
ball
in
my
company
,
whenever
the
coast
be
clear
of
the
rascally
bailiff
who
beset
me
.
<EOS>
this
give
the
lie
to
any
of
those
maligner
who
say
I
wish
to
make
a
prisoner
of
my
wife
.
<EOS>
the
fact
be
,
that
,
know
her
levity
,
and
see
the
insane
dislike
to
me
and
mine
which
have
now
begin
to
supersede
what
,
perhaps
,
have
be
an
equally
insane
fondness
for
me
,
I
be
bind
to
be
on
my
guard
that
she
should
not
give
me
the
slip
.
<EOS>
have
she
leave
me
,
I
be
ruin
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
this
(
which
my
mother
know
)
compel
us
to
keep
a
tight
watch
over
her
;
but
as
for
imprison
her
,
I
repel
the
imputation
with
scorn
.
<EOS>
every
man
imprison
his
wife
to
a
certain
degree
;
the
world
would
be
in
a
pretty
condition
if
woman
be
allow
to
quit
home
and
return
to
it
whenever
they
have
a
mind
.
<EOS>
in
watch
over
my
wife
,
Lady
Lyndon
,
I
do
no
more
than
exercise
the
legitimate
authority
which
award
honour
and
obedience
to
every
husband
.
  
<EOS>
such
,
however
,
be
female
artifice
,
that
,
in
spite
of
all
my
watchfulness
in
guard
her
,
it
be
probable
<EOS>
my
Lady
would
have
give
me
the
slip
,
have
I
not
have
quite
as
acute
a
person
as
herself
as
my
ally
:
<EOS>
for
,
as
the
proverb
say
that
"
the
good
way
to
catch
one
thief
be
to
set
another
after
him
,
"
so
the
good
way
to
get
the
well
of
a
woman
be
to
engage
one
of
her
own
artful
sex
to
guard
her
.
<EOS>
one
would
have
think
that
,
follow
as
she
be
,
all
her
letter
read
,
and
all
her
acquaintance
strictly
watch
by
me
,
live
in
a
remote
part
of
Ireland
away
from
her
family
,
Lady
Lyndon
could
have
have
no
chance
of
communicate
with
her
ally
,
or
of
make
her
wrong
,
as
she
be
pleased
to
call
them
,
public
;
and
yet
,
for
a
while
,
she
carry
on
a
correspondence
under
my
very
nose
,
and
acutely
organise
a
conspiracy
for
fly
from
me
;
as
shall
be
tell
.
  
<EOS>
She
always
have
an
inordinate
passion
for
dress
,
and
,
as
she
be
never
thwart
in
any
whimsey
she
have
of
this
kind
<EOS>
(
for
I
spare
no
money
to
gratify
her
,
and
among
my
debt

with
all
sort
of

,
cap
,
flounce
,
and
furbelow
,
as
her
fancy
dictate
.
<EOS>
with
these
would
come
letter
from
her
milliner
,
in
answer
to
numerous
similar
injunction
from
my
Lady
;
all
of
which
pass
through
my
hand
,
without
the
least
suspicion
,
for
some
time

<EOS>
and
yet
in
these
very
paper

by
the
easy

be
contain
all
her

;
and
Heaven
know
(
for
it
be
some

I
have

I
discover
the

<EOS>
what

against

<EOS>

clever
Mrs.

find
out
that
always
before
my

choose
to
write
letter
to

,
she
have
need
of
lemon
to
make
her
drink

as
she
say
;
this
fact
,
be
mention
to
me
,
set
me
a

thinking
,
and
<EOS>
so
I
try
one
of
the
letter
before
the
fire
,
and
the
whole
scheme
of
villainy
be
bring
to
light
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
a
speciman
of
one
of
the
horrid
artful
letter
of
this
unhappy
woman
.
<EOS>
in
a
great
hand
,
with
wide
line
,
be
write
a
set
of
direction
to
her
mantua

maker
,
set
forth
the
article
of
dress
for
which
my
Lady
have
need
,
the
peculiarity
of
their
make
,
the
stuff
she
select
,
&
c.
She
would
make
out
long
list
in
this
way
,
write
each
article
in
a
separate
line
,
so
as
to
have
more
space
for
detail
all
my
cruelty
and
her
tremendous
wrong
.
<EOS>
between
these
line
she
keep
the
journal
of
her
captivity
:
it
would
have
make
the
fortune
of
a
romance

I
leave

I
could
copy
out
yard
of
rhapsody
to
Lord

her
old

in

she
address
him
by
the
most
affectionate
name

implore
him
to
find
a
refuge

put
herself
into
imaginary

fly
off

heroic

sentimentality

as
little
heart

any

I
ever

show
the
most
violent
disposition

be

write
always

be
in

have
an
elegy
on

lap

dog

the

she
ever
write

most
tender
note

remonstrance
to
Betty

her
favourite
maid

on
quarrel

to
half

a

dozen
acquaintance

each

address

take
up
another

as
for
her
love
for
her

the
above
passage
will
show
how
much
she
be
capable
of
true
maternal
feeling
:
the
very
sentence
in
which
she
record
the
death
of
one
child
serve
to
betray
her
egotism
,
and
to
wreak
her
spleen
against
myself
;

she
only
wish
to
recall
another
from
the
grave

in
order
that
he
may
be
of
some
personal
advantage
to
her

if
I
do
deal
severely
with
this
woman

keep
her
from
her
flatterer

would
have
breed
discord

lock
her
up
out

mischief

shall
say
that
I
be
wrong

deserve
a
strait

people

time
manacle

with
their
head
shave

in

straw

who
have
not
commit
half
the
folly
of
that
foolish

vain

infatuated

be
so
enrage

the
charge

herself

difficulty
I
could
keep
her
from
discover

whom
it
be
,
of
course
,
my
object
to
keep
in
ignorance

design

I
be
anxious

know
how
far
they
go

to
what
pitch
of
artifice
she
would
go
.

the
letter
increase
in
interest
(
as
they
say

novel

as
they
proceed

<EOS>
picture
be
draw
of
my
treatment

would
make

throb

I
do
not

what
monstrosity
she

not
accuse

what
misery

starvation
she
do
not
profess
herself
to
undergo
;
all
the

exceedingly
fat

contented

outward
appearance

at

I
could
not

rough
word

she
merit
many
thousand
a

can
tell
you

but
she
declare
I
be
put
her
to
the
torture

my

could
not
remonstrate
with
her

she
go
off
into
a
fit
of
hysteric
,
of
which
she
would
declare
the
worthy
old

be
the
cause

at
last
she
begin
to
threaten
to
kill
herself

though
I
by
no
means
keep
the

out

do
not
stint
her
in
garter
,
and
leave
her
doctor
's
shop
at
her
entire
service
,
 
know
her
character
full
well
,
and
that
there
be
no
woman
in
Christendom
less
likely
to
lay
hand
on
her
precious
life
than
herself
;
yet
these
threat
have
an
effect
,
evidently
,
in
the
quarter
to
which
they
be
address
;
for
the
milliner
's
packet
now
begin
to
arrive
with
great
frequency
,
and
the
bill
send
to
her
contain
assurance
of
come
aid
.
<EOS>
the
chivalrous
Lord
George
Poynings
be
come
to
his
cousin
's
rescue
,
and
do
me
the
compliment
to
say
that
he
hope
to
free
his
dear
cousin
from
the
clutch
of
the
most
atrocious
villain
that
ever
disgrace
humanity
;
and
that
,
when
she
be
free
,
measure
should
be
take
for
a
divorce
,
on
the
ground
of
cruelty
and
every
specie
of
ill
-
usage
on
my
part
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
copy
of
all
these
precious
document
on
one
side
and
the
other
carefully
make
,
by
my
beforementioned
relative
,
godson
,
and
secretary
,
<EOS>
Mr.
Redmond
Quin
at
present
the
WORTHY
agent
of
the
Castle
Lyndon
property
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
son
of
my
old
flame
Nora
,
whom
I
have
take
from
her
in
a
fit
of
generosity
;
promise
to
care
for
his
education
at
Trinity
College
,
and
provide
for
him
through
life
.
<EOS>
but
after
the
lad
have
be
for
a
year
at
the
University
,
the
tutor
would
not
admit
him
to
common
or
lecture
until
his
college
bill
be
pay
;
and
,
offend
by
this
insolent
manner
of
demand
the
paltry
sum
due
,
I
withdraw
my
patronage
from
the
place
,
and
order
my
gentleman
to
Castle
Lyndon
;
where
I
make
him
useful
to
me
in
a
hundred
way
.
<EOS>
in
my
dear
little
boy
's
lifetime
,
he
tutor
the
poor
child
as
far
as
his
high
spirit
would
let
him
;
but
I
promise
you
it
be
small
trouble
<EOS>
poor
dear
Bryan
ever
give
the
book
.
<EOS>
then
he
keep
Mrs.
Barry
's
account
;
copy
my
own
interminable
correspondence
with
my
lawyer
and
the
agent
of
all
my
various
property
;
take
a
hand
at
piquet
or
backgammon
of
evening
with
me
and
my
mother
;
or
,
be
an
ingenious
lad
enough
(
though
of
a
mean
boorish
spirit
,
as
become
the
son
of
such
a
father
)
,
accompany
my
Lady
Lyndon
's
spinet
with
his
flageolet
;
or
read
french
and
italian
with
her
:
in
both
of
which
language
her
ladyship
be
a
fine
scholar
,
and
with
which
he
also
become
conversant
.
<EOS>
It
would
make
my
watchful
old
mother
very
angry
to
hear
them
converse
in
these
language
;
for
,
not
understand
a
word
of
either
of
them
,
Mrs.
Barry
be
furious
when
they
be
speak
,
and
always
say
it
be
some
scheming
<EOS>
they
be
after
.
<EOS>
It
be
Lady
Lyndon
's
constant
way
of
annoy
the
old
lady
,
when
the
three
be
alone
together
,
to
address
Quin
in
one
or
other
of
these
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
I
be
perfectly
at
ease
with
regard
to
his
fidelity
,
for
I
have
breed
the
lad
,
and
load
him
with
benefit
;
and
,
besides
,
have
have
various
proof
of
his
trustworthiness
.
<EOS>
He
<EOS>
it
be
who
bring
me
three
of
Lord
George
's
letter
,
in
reply
to
some
of
my
Lady
's
complaint
;
which
be
conceal
between
the
leather
and
the
board
of
a
book
which
be
send
from
the
circulate
library
for
her
Ladyship
's
perusal
.
<EOS>
He
and
my
Lady
too
have
frequent
quarrel
.
<EOS>
She
mimic
his
gait
in
her
pleasanter
moment
;
in
her
haughty
mood
,
she
would
not
sit
down
to
table
with
a
tailor
's
grandson
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
send
me
anything
for
company
but
that
odious
Quin
,
"
she
would
say
,
when
I
propose
that
he
should
go
and
amuse
her
with
his
book
and
his
flute
;
for
,
quarrelsome
as
we
be
,
it
must
not
be
suppose
we
be
always
at
it
:
<EOS>
I
be
occasionally
attentive
to
her
.
<EOS>
We
would
be
friend
for
a
month
together
,
sometimes
;
then
we
would
quarrel
for
a
fortnight
;
then
she
would
keep
her
apartment
for
a
month
:
<EOS>
all
of
which
domestic
circumstance
be
note
down
,
in
her
Ladyship
's
peculiar
way
,
in
her
journal
of
captivity
,
as
she
call
it
;
and
a
pretty
document
it
be
!
<EOS>
sometimes
she
write
,
"
My
monster
have
be
almost
kind
to
-
day
;
"
or
,
"
My
ruffian
have
deign
to
smile
.
"
<EOS>
then
she
will
break
out
into
expression
of
savage
hate
;
but
for
my
poor
mother
it
be
ALWAYS
hatred
.
<EOS>
It
be
,
"
the
she
-
dragon
be
sick
to
-
day
;
I
wish
to
Heaven
she
would
die
!
"
<EOS>
or
,
"
the
hideous
old
irish
basketwoman
have
be
treat
me
to
some
of
her
Billingsgate
to
-
day
,
"
and
so
forth
:
all
which
expression
,
read
to
Mrs.
Barry
,
or
translate
from
the
french
and
italian
,
in
which
many
of
them
be
write
,
do
not
fail
to
keep
the
old
lady
in
a
perpetual
fury
against
her
charge
:
<EOS>
and
so
I
have
my
watch
-
dog
,
as
I
call
her
,
always
on
the
alert
.
<EOS>
in
translate
these
language
,
young
Quin
be
of
great
service
to
me
;
for
I
have
a
smattering
of
french
 
and
High
Dutch
,
<EOS>
when
I
be
in
the
army
,
of
course
,
I
know
well
 
<EOS>
but
Italian
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
of
,
and
be
glad
of
the
service
of
so
faithful
and
cheap
an
interpreter
.
  
<EOS>
this
cheap
and
faithful
interpreter
,
this
godson
and
kinsman
,
on
whom
and
on
whose
family
I
have
pile
up
benefit
,
be
actually
try
to
betray
me
;
and
for
several
month
,
at
least
,
be
in
league
with
the
enemy
against
me
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
the
reason
why
they
do
not
move
earlier
be
the
want
of
the
great
mover
of
all
treason
 
money
:
of
which
,
in
all
part
of
my
establishment
,
there
be
a
woful
scarcity
;
but
of
this
they
also
manage
to
get
a
supply
through
my
rascal
of
a
godson
,
who
could
come
and
go
quite
unsuspected
:
the
whole
scheme
be
arrange
under
our
very
nose
,
and
the
post
-
chaise
order
,
and
the
mean
of
escape
actually
get
ready
;
while
I
never
suspect
their
design
.
  
<EOS>
a
mere
accident
make
me
acquaint
with
their
plan
.
<EOS>
one
of
my
collier
have
a
pretty
daughter
;
and
this
pretty
lass
have
for
her
bachelor
,
as
they
call
them
in
Ireland
,
a
certain
lad
,
who
bring
the
letter
-
bag
for
Castle
Lyndon
<EOS>
(
and
many
a
dunning
letter
for
me
be
there
in
it
,
God
wot
!
)
<EOS>
:
this
letter
-
boy
tell
his
sweetheart
how
he
bring
a
bag
of
money
from
the
town
for
Master
Quin
;
and
how
that
Tim
the
post
-
boy
have
tell
him
that
he
be
to
bring
a
chaise
down
to
the
water
at
a
certain
hour
.
<EOS>
Miss
Rooney
,
who
have
no
secret
from
me
,
blurt
out
the
whole
story
;
ask
me
what
scheme
I
be
after
,
and
what
poor
unlucky
girl
I
be
go
to
carry
away
with
the
chaise
I
have
order
,
and
bribe
with
the
money
I
have
get
from
town
?
  
<EOS>
then
the
whole
secret
flash
upon
me
,
that
the
man
I
have
cherish
in
my
bosom
be
go
to
betray
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
at
one
time
of
catch
the
couple
in
the
act
of
escape
,
half
drown
them
in
the
ferry
which
they
have
to
cross
to
get
to
their
chaise
,
and
of
pistol
the
young
traitor
before
Lady
Lyndon
's
eye
;
but
,
on
second
thought
,
it
be
quite
clear
that
the
news
of
the
escape
would
make
a
noise
through
the
country
,
and
rouse
the
confound
justice
's
people
about
my
ear
,
and
bring
me
no
good
in
the
end
.
<EOS>
so
I
be
oblige
to
smother
my
just
indignation
,
and
to
content
myself
by
crush
the
foul
conspiracy
,
just
at
the
moment
it
be
about
to
be
hatch
.
  
<EOS>
I
go
home
,
and
in
half
-
an
-
hour
,
and
with
a
few
of
my
terrible
look
,
I
have
Lady
Lyndon
on
her
knee
,
beg
me
to
forgive
her
;
confess
all
and
everything
;
ready
to
vow
and
swear
she
would
never
make
such
an
attempt
again
;
and
declare
that
she
be
fifty
time
on
the
point
of
own
everything
to
me
,
but
that
she
fear
my
wrath
against
the
poor
young
lad
her
accomplice
:
who
be
indeed
the
author
and
inventor
of
all
the
mischief
.
<EOS>
this
 
though
I
know
how
entirely
false
the
statement
be
 
<EOS>
I
be
fain
to
pretend
to
believe
;
so
I
beg
her
to
write
to
her
cousin
,
Lord
George
,
who
have
supply
her
with
money
,
as
she
admit
,
and
with
whom
the
plan
have
be
arrange
,
state
,
briefly
,
that
she
have
alter
her
mind
as
to
the
trip
to
the
country
propose
;
and
that
,
as
her
dear
husband
be
rather
in
delicate
health
,
she
prefer
to
stay
at
home
and
nurse
him
.
<EOS>
I
add
a
dry
postscript
,
in
which
I
state
that
it
would
give
me
great
pleasure
if
his
lordship
would
come
and
visit
us
at
Castle
Lyndon
,
and
that
I
long
to
renew
an
acquaintance
which
in
former
time
give
me
so
much
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
seek
him
out
,
"
I
add
,
"
so
soon
as
ever
I
be
in
his
neighbourhood
,
and
eagerly
anticipate
the
pleasure
of
a
meeting
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
must
have
understand
my
meaning
perfectly
well
;
which
be
,
that
I
would
run
him
through
the
body
on
the
very
first
occasion
I
could
come
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
then
I
have
a
scene
with
my
perfidious
rascal
of
a
nephew
;
in
which
the
young
reprobate
show
an
audacity
and
a
spirit
for
which
I
be
quite
unprepared
.
<EOS>
when
I
tax
him
with
ingratitude
,
"
what
do
I
owe
you
?
"
say
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
toil
for
you
as
no
man
ever
do
for
another
,
and
work
without
a
penny
of
wage
.
<EOS>
It
be
you
yourself
who
set
me
against
you
,
by
give
me
a
task
against
which
my
soul
revolt
,
 
by
make
me
a
spy
over
your
unfortunate
wife
,
whose
weakness
be
as
pitiable
as
be
her
misfortune
and
your
rascally
treatment
of
her
.
<EOS>
flesh
and
blood
could
not
bear
to
see
the
manner
in
which
you
use
her
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
help
her
to
escape
from
you
;
and
I
would
do
it
again
,
if
the
opportunity
offer
,
and
so
I
tell
you
to
your
tooth
!
<EOS>
"
when
I
offer
to
blow
his
brain
out
for
his
insolence
,
"
pooh
!
"
say
he
,
 
"
kill
the
man
who
save
your
poor
boy
's
life
once
,
and
who
be
endeavour
to
keep
him
out
of
the
ruin
and
perdition
into
which
a
wicked
father
be
lead
him
,
when
a
Merciful
Power
interpose
,
and
withdraw
him
from
this
house
of
crime
?
<EOS>
I
would
have
leave
you
month
ago
,
but
I
hope
for
some
chance
of
rescue
this
unhappy
lady
.
<EOS>
I
swear
I
would
try
,
the
day
I
see
you
strike
her
.
<EOS>
kill
me
,
you
woman
's
bully
!
<EOS>
You
would
if
you
dare
;
but
you
have
not
the
heart
.
<EOS>
Your
very
servant
like
me
better
than
you
.
<EOS>
touch
me
,
and
they
will
rise
and
send
you
to
the
gallow
you
merit
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
interrupt
this
neat
speech
by
send
a
water
-
bottle
at
the
young
gentleman
's
head
,
which
fell
him
to
the
ground
;
and
then
I
go
to
meditate
upon
what
he
have
say
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
be
true
the
fellow
have
save
poor
little
Bryan
's
life
,
and
the
boy
to
his
die
day
be
tenderly
attach
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
be
good
to
Redmond
,
papa
,
"
be
almost
the
last
word
he
speak
;
and
I
promise
the
poor
child
,
on
his
death
-
bed
,
that
I
would
do
as
he
ask
.
<EOS>
It
be
also
true
,
that
rough
usage
of
him
would
be
little
like
by
my
people
,
with
whom
he
have
manage
to
become
a
great
favourite
:
for
,
somehow
,
though
I
get
drunk
with
the
rascal
often
,
and
be
much
more
familiar
with
them
than
a
man
of
my
rank
<EOS>
commonly
be
,
yet
I
know
I
be
by
no
mean
like
by
them
;
and
the
scoundrel
be
murmur
against
me
perpetually
.
  
<EOS>
but
I
may
have
spare
myself
the
trouble
of
debate
what
his
fate
should
be
,
for
the
young
gentleman
take
the
disposal
of
it
out
of
my
hand
in
the
simple
way
in
the
world
:
viz
.
<EOS>
by
wash
and
bind
up
his
head
so
soon
as
he
come
to
himself
:
by
take
his
horse
from
the
stable
;
and
,
as
he
be
quite
free
to
go
in
and
out
of
the
house
and
park
as
he
like
,
he
disappear
without
the
least
let
or
hindrance
;
and
leave
the
horse
behind
him
at
the
ferry
,
go
off
in
the
very
post
-
chaise
which
be
wait
for
Lady
Lyndon
.
<EOS>
I
see
and
hear
no
more
of
him
for
a
considerable
time
;
and
now
that
he
be
out
of
the
house
,
do
not
consider
him
a
very
troublesome
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
but
the
cunning
artifice
of
woman
be
<EOS>
such
that
,
I
think
,
in
the
long
run
,
no
man
,
be
he
Machiavel
himself
,
could
escape
from
it
;
and
though
I
have
ample
proof
in
the
above
transaction
(
in
which
my
wife
's
perfidious
design
be
frustrate
by
my
foresight
)
,
and
under
her
own
handwriting
,
of
the
deceitfulness
of
her
character
and
her
hatred
for
me
,
yet
she
actually
manage
to
deceive
me
,
in
spite
of
all
my
precaution
and
the
vigilance
of
my
mother
in
my
behalf
.
<EOS>
have
I
follow
that
good
lady
's
advice
,
who
scent
the
danger
from
afar
off
,
as
it
be
,
I
should
never
have
fall
into
the
snare
prepare
for
me
;
and
which
be
lay
in
a
way
that
be
as
successful
as
it
be
simple
.
  
<EOS>
My
Lady
Lyndon
's
relation
with
me
be
a
singular
one
.
<EOS>
Her
life
be
pass
in
a
crack
-
brained
sort
of
alternation
between
love
and
hatred
for
me
.
<EOS>
if
I
be
in
a
good
-
humour
with
her
(
as
occur
sometimes
)
<EOS>
there
be
nothing
she
would
not
do
to
propitiate
me
further
;
and
she
would
be
as
absurd
and
violent
in
her
expression
of
fondness
as
,
at
other
moment
,
she
would
be
in
her
demonstration
of
hatred
.
<EOS>
It
be
not
your
feeble
easy
husband
who
be
love
best
in
the
world
;
accord
to
my
experience
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
think
the
woman
like
a
little
violence
of
temper
,
and
think
no
bad
of
a
husband
who
exercise
his
authority
pretty
smartly
.
<EOS>
I
have
get
my
Lady
into
such
a
terror
about
me
,
that
when
I
smile
,
it
be
quite
an
era
of
happiness
to
her
;
and
if
I
beckon
to
her
,
she
would
come
fawn
up
to
me
like
a
dog
.
<EOS>
I
recollect
how
,
for
the
few
day
I
be
at
school
,
the
cowardly
mean
-
spirited
fellow
would
laugh
if
ever
our
schoolmaster
make
a
joke
.
<EOS>
It
be
the
same
in
the
regiment
whenever
the
bully
of
a
sergeant
be
dispose
to
be
jocular
 
not
a
recruit
but
be
on
the
broad
grin
.
<EOS>
well
,
a
wise
and
determined
husband
will
get
his
wife
into
this
condition
of
discipline
;
and
I
bring
my
high
-
bear
wife
to
kiss
my
hand
,
to
pull
off
my
boot
,
to
fetch
and
carry
for
me
like
a
servant
,
and
always
to
make
it
a
holiday
,
too
,
when
I
be
in
good
-
humour
.
<EOS>
I
confide
perhaps
too
much
in
the
duration
of
this
discipline
obedience
,
and
forget
that
the
very
hypocrisy
which
form
a
part
of
it
(
all
timid
people
be
liar
in
their
heart
)
may
be
exert
in
a
way
that
may
be
far
from
agreeable
,
in
order
to
deceive
you
.
  
<EOS>
after
the
ill
-
success
of
her
last
adventure
,
which
give
me
endless
opportunity
to
banter
her
,
one
would
have
think
I
may
have
be
on
my
guard
as
to
what
her
real
intention
be
;
but
she
manage
to
mislead
me
with
an
art
of
dissimulation
quite
admirable
,
and
lull
me
into
a
fatal
security
with
regard
to
her
intention
:
for
,
one
day
,
as
I
be
joke
her
,
and
ask
her
whether
she
would
take
the
water
again
,
whether
she
have
find
another
lover
,
and
so
forth
,
she
suddenly
burst
into
tear
,
and
,
seize
hold
of
my
hand
,
cry
passionately
out
,
    
"
<EOS>
ah
,
Barry
<EOS>
,
you
know
well
enough
that
I
have
never
love
but
you
!
<EOS>
be
I
ever
so
wretched
that
a
kind
word
from
you
do
not
make
me
happy
!
<EOS>
ever
so
angry
,
but
the
least
offer
of
goodwill
on
your
part
do
not
bring
me
to
your
side
?
<EOS>
do
I
not
give
a
sufficient
proof
of
my
affection
for
you
,
in
bestow
one
of
the
first
fortune
in
England
upon
you
?
<EOS>
have
I
repine
or
rebuke
you
for
the
way
you
have
waste
it
?
<EOS>
no
,
I
love
you
too
much
and
too
fondly
;
I
have
always
love
you
.
<EOS>
from
the
first
moment
I
see
you
,
I
feel
irresistibly
attract
towards
you
.
<EOS>
I
see
your
bad
quality
,
and
tremble
at
your
violence
;
but
I
could
not
help
love
you
.
<EOS>
I
marry
you
,
though
I
know
I
be
seal
my
own
fate
in
do
so
;
and
in
spite
of
reason
and
duty
.
<EOS>
what
sacrifice
do
you
want
from
me
?
<EOS>
I
be
ready
to
make
any
,
so
you
will
but
love
me
;
or
,
if
not
,
that
at
least
you
will
gently
use
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
be
in
a
particularly
good
humour
that
day
,
and
we
have
a
sort
of
reconciliation
:
though
my
mother
,
when
she
hear
the
speech
,
and
see
me
soften
towards
her
Ladyship
,
warn
me
solemnly
,
and
say
,
"
depend
on
it
,
the
artful
hussy
have
some
other
scheme
in
her
head
now
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
old
lady
be
right
;
and
I
swallow
the
bait
which
her
Ladyship
have
prepare
to
entrap
me
as
simply
as
any
gudgeon
take
a
hook
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
be
try
to
negotiate
with
a
man
for
some
money
,
for
which
I
have
press
occasion
;
but
since
our
dispute
regard
the
affair
of
the
succession
,
my
Lady
have
resolutely
refuse
to
sign
any
paper
for
my
advantage
:
and
without
her
name
,
I
be
sorry
to
say
,
my
own
be
of
little
value
in
the
market
,
and
I
could
not
get
a
guinea
from
any
money
-
dealer
in
London
or
Dublin
.
<EOS>
nor
could
I
get
the
rascal
from
the
latter
place
to
visit
me
at
Castle
Lyndon
:
<EOS>
owe
to
that
unlucky
affair
I
have
with
Lawyer
Sharp
when
I
make
him
lend
me
the
money
he
bring
down
,
and
old
Salmon
the
Jew
be
rob
of
the
bond
I
give
him
after
leave
my
house
,
[
footnote
:
these
exploit
of
Mr.
Lyndon
be
not
relate
in
the
narrative
.
<EOS>
He
probably
,
in
the
case
above
allude
to
,
take
the
law
into
his
own
hand
.
]
<EOS>
the
people
would
not
trust
themselves
within
my
wall
any
more
.
<EOS>
Our
rent
,
too
,
be
in
the
hand
of
receiver
by
this
time
,
and
it
be
as
much
as
I
could
do
to
get
enough
money
from
the
rascal
to
pay
my
wine
-
merchant
their
bill
.
<EOS>
Our
english
property
,
as
I
have
say
,
be
equally
hamper
;
and
,
as
often
as
I
apply
to
my
lawyer
and
agent
for
money
,
would
come
a
reply
demand
money
of
me
,
for
debt
and
pretend
claim
which
the
rapacious
rascal
say
they
have
on
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
be
,
then
,
with
some
feeling
of
pleasure
that
I
get
a
letter
from
my
confidential
man
in
Gray
's
Inn
,
London
,
say
(
in
reply
to
some
ninety
-
ninth
demand
of
mine
)
that
he
think
he
could
get
me
some
money
;
and
inclose
a
letter
from
a
respectable
firm
in
the
city
of
London
,
connect
with
the
mining
interest
,
which
offer
to
redeem
the
incumbrance
in
take
a
long
lease
of
certain
property
of
our
,
which
be
still
pretty
free
,
upon
the
Countess
's
signature
;
and
provide
they
could
be
assure
of
her
free
will
in
give
it
.
<EOS>
They
say
they
hear
she
live
in
terror
of
her
life
from
me
,
and
meditate
a
separation
,
in
which
case
she
may
repudiate
any
deed
sign
by
her
while
in
durance
,
and
subject
them
,
at
any
rate
,
to
a
doubtful
and
expensive
litigation
;
and
demand
to
be
make
assured
of
her
Ladyship
's
perfect
free
will
in
the
transaction
before
they
advance
a
shilling
of
their
capital
.
  
<EOS>
Their
term
be
so
exorbitant
,
that
I
see
at
once
their
offer
must
be
sincere
;
and
,
as
my
Lady
be
in
her
gracious
mood
,
have
no
difficulty
in
persuade
her
to
write
a
letter
,
in
her
own
hand
,
declare
that
the
account
of
our
misunderstanding
be
utter
calumny
;
that
we
live
in
perfect
union
,
and
that
she
be
quite
ready
to
execute
any
deed
which
her
husband
may
desire
her
to
sign
.
  
<EOS>
this
proposal
be
a
very
timely
one
,
and
fill
me
with
great
hope
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
pester
my
reader
with
many
account
of
my
debt
and
law
affair
;
which
be
by
this
time
so
vast
and
complicate
that
I
never
thoroughly
know
them
myself
,
and
be
render
half
wild
by
their
urgency
.
<EOS>
suffice
it
to
say
,
my
money
be
go
 
<EOS>
my
credit
be
do
.
<EOS>
I
be
live
at
Castle
Lyndon
off
my
own
beef
and
mutton
,
and
the
bread
,
turf
,
and
potatoe
off
my
own
estate
:
I
have
to
watch
Lady
Lyndon
within
,
and
the
bailiff
without
.
<EOS>
for
the
last
two
year
,
since
I
go
to
Dublin
to
receive
money
(
which
I
unluckily
lose
at
play
there
,
to
the
disappointment
of
my
creditor
)
,
I
do
not
venture
to
show
in
that
city
:
and
could
only
appear
at
our
own
county
town
at
rare
interval
,
and
because
I
know
the
sheriff
:
whom
I
swear
I
would
murder
if
any
ill
chance
happen
to
me
.
<EOS>
a
chance
of
a
good
loan
,
then
,
be
the
most
welcome
prospect
possible
to
me
,
and
I
hail
it
with
all
the
eagerness
imaginable
.
  
<EOS>
in
reply
to
Lady
Lyndon
's
letter
,
come
,
in
course
of
time
,
an
answer
from
the
confound
London
merchant
,
state
that
if
her
Ladyship
would
confirm
by
word
of
mouth
,
at
their
counting
-
house
in
Birchin
Lane
,
London
,
the
statement
of
her
letter
,
they
,
have
survey
her
property
,
would
no
doubt
come
to
term
;
but
they
decline
incur
the
risk
of
a
visit
to
Castle
Lyndon
to
negotiate
,
as
they
be
aware
how
other
respectable
party
,
such
as
Messrs.
Sharp
and
Salmon
of
Dublin
,
have
be
treat
there
.
<EOS>
this
be
a
hit
at
me
;
but
there
be
certain
situation
in
which
people
can
not
dictate
their
own
term
:
and
,
"
faith
,
I
be
so
pressed
now
for
money
,
that
I
could
have
sign
a
bond
with
Old
Nick
himself
,
if
he
have
come
provide
with
a
good
round
sum
.
  
<EOS>
I
resolve
to
go
and
take
the
Countess
to
London
.
<EOS>
It
be
in
vain
that
my
mother
pray
and
warn
me
.
"
<EOS>
depend
on
it
,
"
say
she
,
"
there
be
some
artifice
.
<EOS>
when
once
you
get
into
that
wicked
town
,
you
be
not
safe
.
<EOS>
here
you
may
live
for
year
and
year
,
in
luxury
and
splendour
,
bar
claret
and
all
the
window
break
;
but
as
soon
as
they
have
you
in
London
,
they
will
get
the
well
of
my
poor
innocent
lad
;
and
the
first
thing
I
shall
hear
of
you
will
be
,
that
you
be
in
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
why
go
,
Redmond
?
"
say
my
wife
.
<EOS>
"
I
be
happy
here
,
as
long
as
you
be
kind
to
me
,
as
you
be
now
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
appear
in
London
as
we
ought
;
the
little
money
you
will
get
will
be
spend
,
like
all
the
rest
have
be
.
<EOS>
let
us
turn
shepherd
and
shepherdess
,
and
look
to
our
flock
and
be
content
.
"
<EOS>
and
she
take
my
hand
and
kiss
it
;
while
my
mother
only
say
,
"
Humph
!
<EOS>
I
believe
she
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
 
the
wicked
SCHAMER
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
tell
my
wife
she
be
a
fool
;
bade
Mrs.
Barry
not
be
uneasy
,
and
be
hot
upon
go
:
I
would
take
no
denial
from
either
party
.
<EOS>
how
I
be
to
get
the
money
to
go
be
the
question
;
but
that
be
solve
by
my
good
mother
,
who
be
always
ready
to
help
me
on
a
pinch
,
and
who
produce
sixty
guinea
from
a
stocking
.
<EOS>
this
be
all
the
ready
money
that
Barry
Lyndon
,
of
Castle
Lyndon
,
and
marry
to
a
fortune
of
forty
thousand
a
year
,
could
command
:
<EOS>
such
have
be
the
havoc
make
in
this
fine
fortune
by
my
own
extravagance
(
as
I
must
confess
)
,
but
chiefly
by
my
misplace
confidence
and
the
rascality
of
other
.
  
<EOS>
We
do
not
start
in
state
,
you
may
be
sure
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
let
the
country
know
we
be
go
,
or
leave
notice
of
adieu
with
our
neighbour
.
<EOS>
the
famous
Mr.
Barry
Lyndon
and
his
noble
wife
travel
in
a
hack
-
chaise
and
pair
to
Waterford
,
under
the
name
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Jones
,
and
thence
take
shipping
for
Bristol
,
where
we
arrive
quite
without
accident
.
<EOS>
when
a
man
be
go
to
the
deuce
,
how
easy
and
pleasant
the
journey
be
!
<EOS>
the
thought
of
the
money
quite
put
me
in
a
good
humour
,
and
my
wife
,
as
she
lie
on
my
shoulder
in
the
post
-
chaise
go
to
London
,
say
it
be
the
happy
ride
she
have
take
since
our
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
one
night
we
stay
at
Reading
,
whence
<EOS>
I
despatch
a
note
to
my
agent
at
Gray
's
Inn
,
say
I
would
be
with
him
during
the
day
,
and
beg
him
to
procure
me
a
lodging
,
and
to
hasten
the
preparation
for
the
loan
.
<EOS>
My
Lady
and
I
agree
that
we
would
go
to
France
,
and
wait
there
for
well
time
;
and
that
night
,
over
our
supper
,
form
a
score
of
plan
both
for
pleasure
and
retrenchment
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
think
it
be
Darby
and
Joan
together
over
their
supper
.
<EOS>
o
woman
!
<EOS>
woman
!
<EOS>
when
I
recollect
Lady
Lyndon
's
smile
and
blandishment
 
<EOS>
how
happy
she
seem
to
be
on
that
night
!
<EOS>
what
an
air
of
innocent
confidence
appear
in
her
behaviour
,
and
what
affectionate
name
she
call
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
be
lose
in
wonder
at
the
depth
of
her
hypocrisy
.
<EOS>
who
can
be
surprised
that
an
unsuspecting
person
like
myself
should
have
be
a
victim
to
such
a
consummate
deceiver
!
  
<EOS>
We
be
in
London
at
three
o'clock
,
and
half
-
an
-
hour
before
the
time
appoint
our
chaise
drive
to
Gray
's
Inn
.
<EOS>
I
easily
find
out
Mr.
Tapewell
's
apartment
 
a
gloomy
den
<EOS>
it
be
,
and
in
an
unlucky
hour
I
enter
it
!
<EOS>
as
we
go
up
the
dirty
back
-
stair
,
light
by
a
feeble
lamp
and
the
dim
sky
of
a
dismal
London
afternoon
,
my
wife
seem
agitated
and
faint
.
  
<EOS>
"
Redmond
,
"
say
she
,
as
we
get
up
to
the
door
,
"
do
not
go
in
:
<EOS>
I
be
sure
there
be
danger
.
<EOS>
there
be
time
yet
;
let
us
go
back
 
to
Ireland
 
anywhere
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
put
herself
before
the
door
,
in
one
of
her
theatrical
attitude
,
and
take
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
I
just
push
her
away
to
one
side
.
"

I

"
you

an
old

a
mouldy

"
Say
Lady
Lyndon
be
here
;
"
and
stalk
down
the
passage
muttering
"
old
fool
.
<EOS>
"
It
be
"
OLD
"
which
be
the
epithet
that
touch
her
.
<EOS>
I
may
call
her
anything
but
that
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Tapewell
be
in
his
musty
room
,
surround
by
his
parchment
and
tin
box
.
<EOS>
He
advance
and
bow
;
beg
her
ladyship
to
be
seat
;
point
towards
a
chair
for
me
,
which
I
take
,
rather
wonder
at
his
insolence
;
and
then
retreat
to
a
side
-
door
,
say
he
would
be
back
in
one
moment
.
  
<EOS>
and
back
he
do
come
in
one
moment
,
bring
with
him
 
whom
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
another
lawyer
,
six
constable
in
red
waistcoat
with
bludgeon
and
pistol
,
my
Lord
George
Poynings
,
and
his
aunt
Lady
Jane
Peckover
.
  
<EOS>
when
my
Lady
Lyndon
see
her
old
flame
,
she
fling
herself
into
his
arm
in
an
hysterical
passion
.
<EOS>
She
call
him
her
saviour
,
her
preserver
,
her
gallant
knight
;
and
then
,
turn
round
to
me
,
pour
out
a
flood
of
invective
which
quite
astonish
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
old
fool
as
I
be
,
"
say
she
,
"
I
have
outwit
the
most
crafty
and
treacherous
monster
under
the
sun
.
<EOS>
yes
,
I
be
a
fool
when
I
marry
you
,
and
give
up
other
and
noble
heart
for
your
sake
 
<EOS>
yes
,
I
be
a
fool
when
I
forget
my
name
and
lineage
to
unite
myself
with
a
base
-
bear
adventurer
 
a
fool
to
bear
,
without
repine
,
the
most
monstrous
tyranny
that
ever
woman
suffer
;
to
allow
my
property
to
be
squander
;
to
see
woman
,
as
base
and
low
-
bear
as
yourself
"
    
"
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
be
calm
!
"
<EOS>
cry
the
lawyer
;
and
then
bound
back
behind
the
constable
,
see
a
threatening
look
in
my
eye
which
the
rascal
do
not
like
.
<EOS>
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
tear
him
to
piece
,
have
he
come
near
me
.
<EOS>
meanwhile
,
my
Lady
continue
in
a
strain
of
incoherent
fury
;
scream
against
me
,
and
against
my
mother
especially
,
upon
whom
she
heap
abuse
worthy
of
Billingsgate
,
and
always
begin
and
end
the
sentence
with
the
word
fool
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
tell
all
,
my
Lady
,
"
say
I
bitterly
;
"
I
say
old
fool
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
you
say
and
do
,
sir
,
everything
that
a
blackguard
could
say
or
do
,
"
interpose
little
poyning
.
<EOS>
"
this
lady
be
now
safe
under
the
protection
of
her
relation
and
the
law
,
and
need
fear
your
infamous
persecution
no
longer
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
but
you
be
not
safe
,
"
roar
I
;
"
and
,
as
sure
as
I
be
a
man
of
honour
,
and
have
taste
your
blood
once
,
I
will
have
your
heart
's
blood
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
take
down
his
word
,
constable
:
swear
the
peace
against
him
!
"
<EOS>
scream
the
little
lawyer
,
from
behind
his
tipstaff
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
sully
my
sword
with
the
blood
of
such
a
ruffian
,
"
cry
my
Lord
,
rely
on
the
same
doughty
protection
.
<EOS>
"
if
the
scoundrel
remain
in
London
another
day
,
he
will
be
seize
as
a
common
swindler
.
"
<EOS>
and
this
threat
indeed
make
me
wince
;
for
I
know
that
there
be
score
of
writ
out
against
me
in
town
,
and
that
once
in
prison
my
case
be
hopeless
.
  
<EOS>
"
where
be
the
man
will
seize
me
!
"
<EOS>
shout
I
,
draw
my
sword
,
and
place
my
back
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
let
the
scoundrel
come
.
<EOS>
You
 
<EOS>
you
cowardly
braggart
,
come
first
,
if
you
have
the
soul
of
a
man
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
be
not
go
to
seize
you
!
"
<EOS>
say
the
lawyer
;
my
ladyship
,
her
aunt
,
and
a
division
of
the
bailiff
move
off
as
he
speak
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
sir
,
we
do
not
wish
to
seize
you
:
we
will
give
you
a
handsome
sum
to
leave
the
country
;
only
leave
her
ladyship
in
peace
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
and
the
country
will
be
well
rid
of
such
a
villain
!
"
say
my
Lord
,
retreat
too
,
and
not
sorry
to
get
out
of
my
reach
:
and
the
scoundrel
of
a
lawyer
follow
him
,
leave
me
in
possession
of
the
apartment
,
and
in
company
of
the
bully
from
the
police
-
office
,
who
be
all
arm
to
the
tooth
.
<EOS>
I
be
no
longer
the
man
I
be
at
twenty
,
when
I
should
have
charge
the
ruffian
sword
in
hand
,
and
have
send
at
least
one
of
them
to
his
account
.
<EOS>
I
be
break
in
spirit
;
regularly
catch
in
the
toil
:
utterly
baffle
and
beat
by
that
woman
.
<EOS>
be
she
relent
at
the
door
,
when
she
pause
and
beg
me
turn
back
?
<EOS>
have
she
not
a
linger
love
for
me
still
?
<EOS>
Her
conduct
show
it
,
as
I
come
to
reflect
on
it
.
<EOS>
It
be
my
only
chance
now
leave
in
the
world
,
so
I
put
down
my
sword
upon
the
lawyer
's
desk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
say
I
,
"
I
shall
use
no
violence
;
you
may
tell
Mr.
Tapewell
I
be
quite
ready
to
speak
with
him
when
he
be
at
leisure
!
"
<EOS>
and
I
sit
down
and
fold
my
arm
quite
peaceably
.
<EOS>
what
a
change
from
the
Barry
Lyndon
of
old
day
!
<EOS>
but
,
as
I
have
read
in
an
old
book
about
Hannibal
the
carthaginian
general
,
when
he
invade
the
Romans
,
his
troop
,
which
be
the
most
gallant
in
the
world
,
and
carry
all
before
them
,
go
into
cantonment
in
some
city
where
they
be
so
sated
with
the
luxury
and
pleasure
of
life
,
that
they
be
easily
beat
in
the
next
campaign
.
<EOS>
It
be
so
with
me
now
.
<EOS>
My
strength
of
mind
and
body
be
no
longer
those
of
the
brave
youth
who
shoot
his
man
at
fifteen
,
and
fight
a
score
of
battle
within
six
year
afterwards
.
<EOS>
now
,
in
the
Fleet
Prison
,
where
I
write
this
,
there
be
a
small
man
who
be
always
jeer
me
and
make
game
of
me
;
who
ask
me
to
fight
,
and
I
have
not
the
courage
to
touch
him
.
<EOS>
but
I
be
anticipate
the
gloomy
and
wretched
event
of
my
history
of
humiliation
,
and
have
well
proceed
in
order
.
  
<EOS>
I
take
a
lodging
in
a
coffee
-
house
near
Gray
's
Inn
;
take
care
to
inform
Mr.
Tapewell
of
my
whereabouts
,
and
anxiously
expect
a
visit
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
come
and
bring
me
the
term
which
Lady
Lyndon
's
friend
propose
-
a
paltry
annuity
of
L300
a
year
;
to
be
pay
on
the
condition
of
my
remain
abroad
out
of
the
three
kingdom
,
and
to
be
stop
on
the
instant
of
my
return
.
<EOS>
He
tell
me
what
I
very
well
know
,
that
my
stay
in
London
would
infallibly
plunge
me
in
gaol
;
that
there
be
writ
innumerable
take
out
against
me
here
,
and
in
the
West
of
England
;
that
my
credit
be
so
blow
upon
that
I
could
not
hope
to
raise
a
shilling
;
and
he
leave
me
a
night
to
consider
of
his
proposal
;
say
that
,
if
I
refuse
it
,
the
family
would
proceed
:
if
I
accede
,
a
quarter
's
salary
should
be
pay
to
me
at
any
foreign
port
I
should
prefer
.
  
<EOS>
what
be
the
poor
,
lonely
,
and
break
-
hearted
man
to
do
?
<EOS>
I
take
the
annuity
,
and
be
declare
outlaw
in
the
course
of
next
week
.
<EOS>
the
rascal
Quin
have
,
I
find
,
be
,
after
all
,
the
cause
of
my
undoing
.
<EOS>
It
be
he
devise
the
scheme
for
bring
me
up
to
London
;
seal
the
attorney
's
letter
with
a
seal
which
have
be
agree
upon
between
him
and
the
Countess
formerly
:
indeed
he
have
always
be
for
try
the
plan
,
and
have
propose
it
at
first
;
but
her
Ladyship
,
with
her
inordinate
love
of
romance
,
prefer
the
project
of
elopement
.
<EOS>
of
these
point
my
mother
write
me
word
in
my
lonely
exile
,
offer
at
the
same
time
to
come
over
and
share
it
with
me
;
which
proposal
I
decline
.
<EOS>
She
leave
Castle
Lyndon
a
very
short
time
after
I
have
quit
it
;
and
there
be
silence
in
that
hall
where
,
under
my
authority
,
have
be
exhibit
so
much
hospitality
and
splendour
.
<EOS>
She
think
she
would
never
see
me
again
,
and
bitterly
reproach
me
for
neglect
her
;
but
she
be
mistake
in
that
,
and
in
her
estimate
of
me
.
<EOS>
She
be
very
old
,
and
be
sit
by
my
side
at
this
moment
in
the
prison
,
work
:
she
have
a
bedroom
in
Fleet
Market
over
the
way
;
and
,
with
the
fifty
-
pound
annuity
,
which
she
have
keep
with
a
wise
prudence
,
we
manage
to
eke
out
a
miserable
existence
,
quite
unworthy
of
the
famous
and
fashionable
Barry
Lyndon
.
