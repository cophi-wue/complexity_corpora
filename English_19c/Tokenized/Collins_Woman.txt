THE
STORY
BEGUN
BY
<EOS>
WALTER
HARTRIGHT
  
(
of
Clement
's
Inn
,
Teacher
of
Drawing
)
  
<EOS>
This
is
the
story
of
what
a
Woman
's
patience
can
endure
,
and
what
a
Man
's
resolution
can
achieve
.
  
<EOS>
If
the
machinery
of
the
Law
could
be
depended
on
to
fathom
every
case
of
suspicion
,
and
to
conduct
every
process
of
inquiry
,
with
moderate
assistance
only
from
the
lubricating
influences
of
oil
of
gold
,
the
events
which
fill
these
pages
might
have
claimed
their
share
of
the
public
attention
in
a
Court
of
Justice
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
Law
is
still
,
in
certain
inevitable
cases
,
the
pre
-
engaged
servant
of
the
long
purse
;
and
the
story
is
left
to
be
told
,
for
the
first
time
,
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
As
the
Judge
might
once
have
heard
it
,
so
the
Reader
shall
hear
it
now
.
<EOS>
No
circumstance
of
importance
,
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
disclosure
,
shall
be
related
on
hearsay
evidence
.
<EOS>
When
the
writer
of
these
introductory
lines
(
Walter
Hartright
by
name
)
happens
to
be
more
closely
connected
than
others
with
the
incidents
to
be
recorded
,
he
will
describe
them
in
his
own
person
.
<EOS>
When
his
experience
fails
,
he
will
retire
from
the
position
of
narrator
;
and
his
task
will
be
continued
,
from
the
point
at
which
he
has
left
it
off
,
by
other
persons
who
can
speak
to
the
circumstances
under
notice
from
their
own
knowledge
,
just
as
clearly
and
positively
as
he
has
spoken
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
,
the
story
here
presented
will
be
told
by
more
than
one
pen
,
as
the
story
of
an
offence
against
the
laws
is
told
in
Court
by
more
than
one
witness
 
with
the
same
object
,
in
both
cases
,
to
present
the
truth
always
in
its
most
direct
and
most
intelligible
aspect
;
and
to
trace
the
course
of
one
complete
series
of
events
,
by
making
the
persons
who
have
been
most
closely
connected
with
them
,
at
each
successive
stage
,
relate
their
own
experience
,
word
for
word
.
  
<EOS>
Let
Walter
Hartright
,
teacher
of
drawing
,
aged
twenty
-
eight
years
,
be
heard
first
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
the
last
day
of
July
.
<EOS>
The
long
hot
summer
was
drawing
to
a
close
;
and
we
,
the
weary
pilgrims
of
the
London
pavement
,
were
beginning
to
think
of
the
cloud
-
shadows
on
the
corn
-
fields
,
and
the
autumn
breezes
on
the
sea
-
shore
.
  
<EOS>
For
my
own
poor
part
,
the
fading
summer
left
me
out
of
health
,
out
of
spirits
,
and
,
if
the
truth
must
be
told
,
out
of
money
as
well
.
<EOS>
During
the
past
year
I
had
not
managed
my
professional
resources
as
carefully
as
usual
;
and
my
extravagance
now
limited
me
to
the
prospect
of
spending
the
autumn
economically
between
my
mother
's
cottage
at
Hampstead
and
my
own
chambers
in
town
.
  
<EOS>
The
evening
,
I
remember
,
was
still
and
cloudy
<EOS>
;
the
London
air
was
at
its
heaviest
;
the
distant
hum
of
the
street
-
traffic
was
at
its
faintest
;
the
small
pulse
of
the
life
within
me
,
and
the
great
heart
of
the
city
around
me
,
seemed
to
be
sinking
in
unison
,
languidly
and
more
languidly
,
with
the
sinking
sun
.
<EOS>
I
roused
myself
from
the
book
which
I
was
dreaming
over
rather
than
reading
,
and
left
my
chambers
to
meet
the
cool
night
air
in
the
suburbs
.
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
the
two
evenings
in
every
week
which
I
was
accustomed
to
spend
with
my
mother
and
my
sister
.
<EOS>
So
I
turned
my
steps
northward
in
the
direction
of
Hampstead
.
  
<EOS>
Events
which
I
have
yet
to
relate
make
it
necessary
to
mention
in
this
place
that
my
father
had
been
dead
some
years
at
the
period
of
which
I
am
now
writing
;
and
that
my
sister
Sarah
and
I
were
the
sole
survivors
of
a
family
of
five
children
.
<EOS>
My
father
was
a
drawing
-
master
before
me
.
<EOS>
His
exertions
had
made
him
highly
successful
in
his
profession
;
and
his
affectionate
anxiety
to
provide
for
the
future
of
those
who
were
dependent
on
his
labours
had
impelled
him
,
from
the
time
of
his
marriage
,
to
devote
to
the
insuring
of
his
life
a
much
larger
portion
of
his
income
than
most
men
consider
it
necessary
to
set
aside
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
Thanks
to
his
admirable
prudence
and
self
-
denial
<EOS>
my
mother
and
sister
were
left
,
after
his
death
,
as
independent
of
the
world
as
they
had
been
during
his
lifetime
.
<EOS>
I
succeeded
to
his
connection
,
and
had
every
reason
to
feel
grateful
for
the
prospect
that
awaited
me
at
my
starting
in
life
.
  
<EOS>
The
quiet
twilight
was
still
trembling
on
the
topmost
ridges
of
the
heath
;
and
the
view
of
London
below
me
had
sunk
into
a
black
gulf
in
the
shadow
of
the
cloudy
night
,
when
I
stood
before
the
gate
of
my
mother
's
cottage
.
<EOS>
I
had
hardly
rung
the
bell
before
the
house
door
was
opened
violently
;
my
worthy
Italian
friend
,
Professor
Pesca
,
appeared
in
the
servant
's
place
;
and
darted
out
joyously
to
receive
me
,
with
a
shrill
foreign
parody
on
an
English
cheer
.
  
<EOS>
On
his
own
account
,
and
,
I
must
be
allowed
to
add
,
on
mine
also
,
the
Professor
merits
the
honour
of
a
formal
introduction
.
<EOS>
Accident
has
made
him
the
starting
-
point
of
the
strange
family
story
which
it
is
the
purpose
of
these
pages
to
unfold
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
first
become
acquainted
with
my
Italian
friend
by
meeting
him
at
certain
great
houses
where
he
taught
his
own
language
<EOS>
and
I
taught
drawing
.
<EOS>
All
I
then
knew
of
the
history
of
his
life
was
,
that
he
had
once
held
a
situation
in
the
University
of
Padua
;
that
he
had
left
Italy
for
political
reasons
(
the
nature
of
which
he
uniformly
declined
to
mention
to
any
one
)
;
and
that
he
had
been
for
many
years
respectably
established
in
London
as
a
teacher
of
languages
.
  
<EOS>
Without
being
actually
a
dwarf
 
for
he
was
perfectly
well
proportioned
from
head
to
foot
 
<EOS>
Pesca
was
,
I
think
,
the
smallest
human
being
I
ever
saw
out
of
a
show
-
room
.
<EOS>
Remarkable
anywhere
,
by
his
personal
appearance
,
he
was
still
further
distinguished
among
the
rank
and
file
of
mankind
by
the
harmless
eccentricity
of
his
character
.
<EOS>
The
ruling
idea
of
his
life
appeared
to
be
,
that
he
was
bound
to
show
his
gratitude
to
the
country
which
had
afforded
him
an
asylum
and
a
means
of
subsistence
by
doing
his
utmost
to
turn
himself
into
an
Englishman
.
<EOS>
Not
content
with
paying
the
nation
in
general
the
compliment
of
invariably
carrying
an
umbrella
,
and
invariably
wearing
gaiters
and
a
white
hat
,
the
Professor
further
aspired
to
become
an
Englishman
in
his
habits
and
amusements
,
as
well
as
in
his
personal
appearance
.
<EOS>
Finding
us
distinguished
,
as
a
nation
,
by
our
love
of
athletic
exercises
,
the
little
man
,
in
the
innocence
of
his
heart
,
devoted
himself
impromptu
to
all
our
English
sports
and
pastimes
whenever
he
had
the
opportunity
of
joining
them
;
firmly
persuaded
that
he
could
adopt
our
national
amusements
of
the
field
by
an
effort
of
will
precisely
as
he
had
adopted
our
national
gaiters
and
our
national
white
hat
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
seen
him
risk
his
limbs
blindly
at
a
fox
-
hunt
and
in
a
cricket
-
field
;
and
soon
afterwards
I
saw
him
risk
his
life
,
just
as
blindly
,
in
the
sea
at
Brighton
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
met
there
accidentally
,
and
were
bathing
together
.
<EOS>
If
we
had
been
engaged
in
any
exercise
peculiar
to
my
own
nation
I
should
,
of
course
,
have
looked
after
Pesca
carefully
;
but
as
foreigners
are
generally
quite
as
well
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
in
the
water
as
Englishmen
,
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
the
art
of
swimming
might
merely
add
one
more
to
the
list
of
manly
exercises
which
the
Professor
believed
that
he
could
learn
impromptu
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
we
had
both
struck
out
from
shore
,
I
stopped
,
finding
my
friend
did
not
gain
on
me
,
and
turned
round
to
look
for
him
.
<EOS>
To
my
horror
and
amazement
,
I
saw
nothing
between
me
and
the
beach
but
two
little
white
arms
which
struggled
for
an
instant
above
the
surface
of
the
water
,
and
then
disappeared
from
view
.
<EOS>
When
I
dived
for
him
,
the
poor
little
man
was
lying
quietly
coiled
up
at
the
bottom
,
in
a
hollow
of
shingle
,
looking
by
many
degrees
smaller
than
I
had
ever
seen
him
look
before
.
<EOS>
During
the
few
minutes
that
elapsed
while
I
was
taking
him
in
,
the
air
revived
him
,
and
he
ascended
the
steps
of
the
machine
with
my
assistance
.
<EOS>
With
the
partial
recovery
of
his
animation
came
the
return
of
his
wonderful
delusion
on
the
subject
of
swimming
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
his
chattering
teeth
would
let
him
speak
,
he
smiled
vacantly
,
and
said
he
thought
it
must
have
been
the
Cramp
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
thoroughly
recovered
himself
,
and
had
joined
me
on
the
beach
,
his
warm
Southern
nature
broke
through
all
artificial
English
restraints
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
He
overwhelmed
me
with
the
wildest
expressions
of
affection
 
exclaimed
passionately
,
in
his
exaggerated
Italian
way
,
that
he
would
hold
his
life
henceforth
at
my
disposal
 
and
declared
that
he
should
never
be
happy
again
until
he
had
found
an
opportunity
of
proving
his
gratitude
by
rendering
me
some
service
which
I
might
remember
,
on
my
side
,
to
the
end
of
my
days
.
  
<EOS>
I
did
my
best
to
stop
the
torrent
of
his
tears
and
protestations
by
persisting
in
treating
the
whole
adventure
as
a
good
subject
for
a
joke
;
and
succeeded
at
last
,
as
I
imagined
,
in
lessening
Pesca
's
overwhelming
sense
of
obligation
to
me
.
<EOS>
Little
<EOS>
did
I
think
then
 
little
<EOS>
did
I
think
afterwards
when
our
pleasant
holiday
had
drawn
to
an
end
 
that
the
opportunity
of
serving
me
for
which
my
grateful
companion
so
ardently
longed
was
soon
to
come
;
that
he
was
eagerly
to
seize
it
on
the
instant
;
and
that
by
so
doing
he
was
to
turn
the
whole
current
of
my
existence
into
a
new
channel
,
and
to
alter
me
to
myself
almost
past
recognition
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
so
it
was
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
not
dived
for
Professor
Pesca
when
he
lay
under
water
on
his
shingle
bed
,
I
should
in
all
human
probability
never
have
been
connected
with
the
story
which
these
pages
will
relate
 
<EOS>
I
should
never
,
perhaps
,
have
heard
even
the
name
of
the
woman
who
has
lived
in
all
my
thoughts
,
who
has
possessed
herself
of
all
my
energies
,
who
has
become
the
one
guiding
influence
that
now
directs
the
purpose
of
my
life
.
    
<EOS>
Pesca
's
face
and
manner
,
on
the
evening
when
we
confronted
each
other
at
my
mother
's
gate
,
were
more
than
sufficient
to
inform
me
that
something
extraordinary
had
happened
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
useless
,
however
,
to
ask
him
for
an
immediate
explanation
.
<EOS>
I
could
only
conjecture
,
while
he
was
dragging
me
in
by
both
hands
,
that
(
knowing
my
habits
)
he
had
come
to
the
cottage
to
make
sure
of
meeting
me
that
night
,
and
that
he
had
some
news
to
tell
of
an
unusually
agreeable
kind
.
  
<EOS>
We
both
bounced
into
the
parlour
in
a
highly
abrupt
and
undignified
manner
.
<EOS>
My
mother
sat
by
the
open
window
laughing
and
fanning
herself
.
<EOS>
Pesca
was
one
of
her
especial
favourites
and
his
wildest
eccentricities
were
always
pardonable
in
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
Poor
dear
soul
!
<EOS>
from
the
first
moment
when
she
found
out
that
the
little
Professor
was
deeply
and
gratefully
attached
to
her
son
,
she
opened
her
heart
to
him
unreservedly
,
and
took
all
his
puzzling
foreign
peculiarities
for
granted
,
without
so
much
as
attempting
to
understand
any
one
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
My
sister
Sarah
,
with
all
the
advantages
of
youth
,
was
,
strangely
enough
,
less
pliable
.
<EOS>
She
did
full
justice
to
Pesca
's
excellent
qualities
of
heart
;
but
she
could
not
accept
him
implicitly
,
as
my
mother
accepted
him
,
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
Her
insular
notions
of
propriety
rose
in
perpetual
revolt
against
Pesca
's
constitutional
contempt
for
appearances
;
and
she
was
always
more
or
less
undisguisedly
astonished
at
her
mother
's
familiarity
with
the
eccentric
little
foreigner
.
<EOS>
I
have
observed
,
not
only
in
my
sister
's
case
,
but
in
the
instances
of
others
,
that
we
of
the
young
generation
are
nothing
like
so
hearty
and
so
impulsive
as
some
of
our
elders
.
<EOS>
I
constantly
see
old
people
flushed
and
excited
by
the
prospect
of
some
anticipated
pleasure
which
altogether
fails
to
ruffle
the
tranquillity
of
their
serene
grandchildren
.
<EOS>
Are
we
,
I
wonder
,
quite
such
genuine
boys
and
girls
now
as
our
seniors
were
in
their
time
?
<EOS>
Has
the
great
advance
in
education
taken
rather
too
long
a
stride
;
and
are
we
in
these
modern
days
,
just
the
least
trifle
in
the
world
too
well
brought
up
?
  
<EOS>
Without
attempting
to
answer
those
questions
decisively
,
I
may
at
least
record
that
I
never
saw
my
mother
and
my
sister
together
in
Pesca
's
society
,
without
finding
my
mother
much
the
younger
woman
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
,
for
example
,
while
the
old
lady
was
laughing
heartily
over
the
boyish
manner
in
which
we
tumbled
into
the
parlour
,
Sarah
was
perturbedly
picking
up
the
broken
pieces
of
a
teacup
,
which
the
Professor
had
knocked
off
the
table
in
his
precipitate
advance
to
meet
me
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
would
have
happened
,
Walter
,
"
said
my
mother
,
"
if
you
had
delayed
much
longer
.
<EOS>
Pesca
has
been
half
mad
with
impatience
,
and
I
have
been
half
mad
with
curiosity
.
<EOS>
The
Professor
has
brought
some
wonderful
news
with
him
,
in
which
he
says
you
are
concerned
;
and
he
has
cruelly
refused
to
give
us
the
smallest
hint
of
it
till
his
friend
Walter
appeared
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
provoking
:
it
spoils
the
Set
,
"
murmured
Sarah
to
herself
,
mournfully
absorbed
over
the
ruins
of
the
broken
cup
.
  
<EOS>
While
these
words
were
being
spoken
,
Pesca
,
happily
and
fussily
unconscious
of
the
irreparable
wrong
which
the
crockery
had
suffered
at
his
hands
,
was
dragging
a
large
arm
-
chair
to
the
opposite
end
of
the
room
,
so
as
to
command
us
all
three
,
in
the
character
of
a
public
speaker
addressing
an
audience
.
<EOS>
Having
turned
the
chair
with
its
back
towards
us
,
he
jumped
into
it
on
his
knees
,
and
excitedly
addressed
his
small
congregation
of
three
from
an
impromptu
pulpit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
good
dears
,
"
began
Pesca
(
who
always
said
"
good
dears
"
when
he
meant
"
worthy
friends
"
)
,
"
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
The
time
has
come
 
<EOS>
I
recite
my
good
news
 
<EOS>
I
speak
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Hear
,
hear
!
<EOS>
"
said
my
mother
,
humouring
the
joke
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
next
thing
he
will
break
,
mamma
,
"
whispered
Sarah
,
"
will
be
the
back
of
the
best
arm
-
chair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
go
back
into
my
life
,
and
I
address
myself
to
the
noblest
of
created
beings
,
"
continued
Pesca
,
vehemently
apostrophising
my
unworthy
self
over
the
top
rail
of
the
chair
.
<EOS>
"
Who
found
me
dead
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
(
through
Cramp
)
;
and
who
pulled
me
up
to
the
top
;
and
what
did
I
say
when
I
got
into
my
own
life
and
my
own
clothes
again
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Much
more
than
was
at
all
necessary
,
"
I
answered
as
doggedly
as
possible
;
for
the
least
encouragement
in
connection
with
this
subject
invariably
let
loose
the
Professor
's
emotions
in
a
flood
of
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
"
persisted
Pesca
,
"
that
my
life
belonged
to
my
dear
friend
,
Walter
,
for
the
rest
of
my
days
 
<EOS>
and
so
it
does
.
<EOS>
I
said
that
I
should
never
be
happy
again
till
I
had
found
the
opportunity
of
doing
a
good
Something
for
Walter
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
never
been
contented
with
myself
till
this
most
blessed
day
.
<EOS>
Now
,
"
cried
the
enthusiastic
little
man
at
the
top
of
his
voice
,
"
the
overflowing
happiness
bursts
out
of
me
at
every
pore
of
my
skin
,
like
a
perspiration
;
for
on
my
faith
,
and
soul
,
and
honour
,
the
something
is
done
at
last
,
and
the
only
word
to
say
now
is
 
Right
-
all
-
right
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
necessary
to
explain
here
that
Pesca
prided
himself
on
being
a
perfect
Englishman
in
his
language
,
as
well
as
in
his
dress
,
manners
,
and
amusements
.
<EOS>
Having
picked
up
a
few
of
our
most
familiar
colloquial
expressions
,
he
scattered
them
about
over
his
conversation
whenever
they
happened
to
occur
to
him
,
turning
them
,
in
his
high
relish
for
their
sound
and
his
general
ignorance
of
their
sense
,
into
compound
words
and
repetitions
of
his
own
,
and
always
running
them
into
each
other
,
as
if
they
consisted
of
one
long
syllable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Among
the
fine
London
Houses
where
I
teach
the
language
of
my
native
country
,
"
said
the
Professor
,
rushing
into
his
long
-
deferred
explanation
without
another
word
of
preface
,
"
there
is
one
,
mighty
fine
,
in
the
big
place
called
Portland
.
<EOS>
You
all
know
where
that
is
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
 
course
-
of
-
course
.
<EOS>
The
fine
house
,
my
good
dears
,
has
got
inside
it
a
fine
family
.
<EOS>
A
Mamma
,
fair
and
fat
;
three
young
Misses
,
fair
and
fat
;
two
young
Misters
,
fair
and
fat
;
and
a
Papa
,
the
fairest
and
the
fattest
of
all
,
who
is
a
mighty
merchant
,
up
to
his
eyes
in
gold
 
<EOS>
a
fine
man
once
,
but
seeing
that
he
has
got
a
naked
head
and
two
chins
,
fine
no
longer
at
the
present
time
.
<EOS>
Now
mind
!
<EOS>
I
teach
the
sublime
Dante
to
the
young
Misses
,
and
ah
!
 
<EOS>
my
-
soul
-
bless
-
my
-
soul
!
 
<EOS>
it
is
not
in
human
language
to
say
how
the
sublime
Dante
puzzles
the
pretty
heads
of
all
three
!
<EOS>
No
matter
 
all
in
good
time
 
and
the
more
lessons
the
better
for
me
.
<EOS>
Now
mind
!
<EOS>
Imagine
to
yourselves
that
I
am
teaching
the
young
Misses
to
-
day
,
as
usual
.
<EOS>
We
are
all
four
of
us
down
together
in
the
Hell
of
Dante
.
<EOS>
At
the
Seventh
Circle
 
but
no
matter
for
that
:
all
the
Circles
are
alike
to
the
three
young
Misses
,
fair
and
fat
,
 
at
the
Seventh
Circle
,
nevertheless
,
my
pupils
are
sticking
fast
;
and
I
,
to
set
them
going
again
,
recite
,
explain
,
and
blow
myself
up
red
-
hot
with
useless
enthusiasm
,
when
 
a
creak
of
boots
in
the
passage
outside
,
and
in
comes
the
golden
Papa
,
the
mighty
merchant
with
the
naked
head
and
the
two
chins
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
my
good
dears
,
I
am
closer
than
you
think
for
to
the
business
,
now
.
<EOS>
Have
you
been
patient
so
far
?
<EOS>
or
have
you
said
to
yourselves
,
"
Deuce
-
what
-
the
-
deuce
!
<EOS>
Pesca
is
long
-
winded
to
-
night
?
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
declared
that
we
were
deeply
interested
.
<EOS>
The
Professor
went
on
:
  
"
<EOS>
In
his
hand
,
the
golden
Papa
has
a
letter
;
and
after
he
has
made
his
excuse
for
disturbing
us
in
our
Infernal
Region
with
the
common
mortal
Business
of
the
house
,
he
addresses
himself
to
the
three
young
Misses
,
and
begins
,
as
you
English
begin
everything
in
this
blessed
world
that
you
have
to
say
,
with
a
great
O.
"
O
,
my
dears
,
"
says
the
mighty
merchant
,
"
I
have
got
here
a
letter
from
my
friend
,
Mr.
 
"
(
the
name
has
slipped
out
of
my
mind
;
but
no
matter
;
we
shall
come
back
to
that
;
yes
,
yes
 
<EOS>
right
-
all
-
right
)
.
<EOS>
So
the
Papa
says
,
"
I
have
got
a
letter
from
my
friend
,
the
Mister
;
and
he
wants
a
recommend
from
me
,
of
a
drawing
-
master
,
to
go
down
to
his
house
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
-
soul
-
bless
-
my
-
soul
!
<EOS>
when
I
heard
the
golden
Papa
say
those
words
,
if
I
had
been
big
enough
to
reach
up
to
him
,
I
should
have
put
my
arms
round
his
neck
,
and
pressed
him
to
my
bosom
in
a
long
and
grateful
hug
!
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
I
only
bounced
upon
my
chair
.
<EOS>
My
seat
was
on
thorns
,
and
my
soul
was
on
fire
to
speak
<EOS>
but
I
held
my
tongue
,
and
let
Papa
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
know
,
"
says
this
good
man
of
money
,
twiddling
his
friend
's
letter
this
way
and
that
,
in
his
golden
fingers
and
thumbs
,
"
perhaps
you
know
,
my
dears
,
of
a
drawing
-
master
that
I
can
recommend
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
three
young
Misses
all
look
at
each
other
,
and
then
say
(
with
the
indispensable
great
O
to
begin
)
<EOS>
"
O
,
dear
no
,
Papa
!
<EOS>
But
here
is
Mr.
Pesca
"
<EOS>
At
the
mention
of
myself
I
can
hold
no
longer
 
the
thought
of
you
,
my
good
dears
,
mounts
like
blood
to
my
head
 
I
start
from
my
seat
,
as
if
a
spike
had
grown
up
from
the
ground
through
the
bottom
of
my
chair
 
<EOS>
I
address
myself
to
the
mighty
merchant
,
and
I
say
(
English
phrase
)
<EOS>
"
Dear
sir
,
I
have
the
man
!
<EOS>
The
first
and
foremost
drawing
-
master
of
the
world
!
<EOS>
Recommend
him
by
the
post
to
-
night
,
and
send
him
off
,
bag
and
baggage
(
English
phrase
again
 
ha
!
)
,
send
him
off
,
bag
and
baggage
,
by
the
train
to
-
morrow
!
"
<EOS>
"
Stop
,
stop
,
"
says
Papa
;
"
is
he
a
foreigner
,
or
an
Englishman
?
"
<EOS>
"
English
to
the
bone
of
his
back
,
"
I
answer
.
"
<EOS>
Respectable
?
"
says
Papa
.
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
I
say
(
for
this
last
question
of
his
outrages
me
,
and
I
have
done
being
familiar
with
him
 
)
<EOS>
"
Sir
!
<EOS>
the
immortal
fire
of
genius
burns
in
this
Englishman
's
bosom
,
and
,
what
is
more
,
his
father
had
it
before
him
!
"
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
"
says
the
golden
barbarian
of
a
Papa
,
"
never
mind
about
his
genius
,
Mr.
Pesca
.
<EOS>
We
do
n't
want
genius
in
this
country
,
unless
it
is
accompanied
by
respectability
 
<EOS>
and
then
we
are
very
glad
to
have
it
,
very
glad
indeed
.
<EOS>
Can
your
friend
produce
testimonials
 
letters
that
speak
to
his
character
?
<EOS>
"
I
wave
my
hand
negligently
.
<EOS>
"
Letters
?
<EOS>
"
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
my
-
soul
-
bless
-
my
-
soul
!
<EOS>
I
should
think
so
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
Volumes
of
letters
and
portfolios
of
testimonials
,
if
you
like
!
"
<EOS>
"
One
or
two
will
do
,
"
says
this
man
of
phlegm
and
money
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
him
send
them
to
me
,
with
his
name
and
address
.
<EOS>
And
 
stop
,
stop
,
Mr.
Pesca
 
<EOS>
before
you
go
to
your
friend
,
you
had
better
take
a
note
.
"
<EOS>
"
Bank
-
note
!
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
indignantly
.
"
<EOS>
No
bank
-
note
,
if
you
please
,
till
my
brave
Englishman
has
earned
it
first
.
"
<EOS>
"
Bank
-
note
!
<EOS>
"
says
Papa
,
in
a
great
surprise
,
"
who
talked
of
bank
-
note
?
<EOS>
I
mean
a
note
of
the
terms
 
a
memorandum
of
what
he
is
expected
to
do
.
<EOS>
Go
on
with
your
lesson
,
Mr.
Pesca
,
and
I
will
give
you
the
necessary
extract
from
my
friend
's
letter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Down
sits
the
man
of
merchandise
and
money
to
his
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
;
and
down
I
go
once
again
into
the
Hell
of
Dante
,
with
my
three
young
Misses
after
me
.
<EOS>
In
ten
minutes
'
time
the
note
is
written
,
and
the
boots
of
Papa
are
creaking
themselves
away
in
the
passage
outside
.
<EOS>
From
that
moment
,
on
my
faith
,
and
soul
,
and
honour
,
I
know
nothing
more
!
<EOS>
The
glorious
thought
that
I
have
caught
my
opportunity
at
last
,
and
that
my
grateful
service
for
my
dearest
friend
in
the
world
is
as
good
as
done
already
,
flies
up
into
my
head
and
makes
me
drunk
.
<EOS>
How
I
pull
my
young
Misses
and
myself
out
of
our
Infernal
Region
again
,
how
my
other
business
is
done
afterwards
,
how
my
little
bit
of
dinner
slides
itself
down
my
throat
,
I
know
no
more
than
a
man
in
the
moon
.
<EOS>
Enough
for
me
,
that
here
I
am
,
with
the
mighty
merchant
's
note
in
my
hand
,
as
large
as
life
,
as
hot
as
fire
,
and
as
happy
as
a
king
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
right
-
right
<EOS>
-
right
-
all
-
right
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
the
Professor
waved
the
memorandum
of
terms
over
his
head
,
and
ended
his
long
and
voluble
narrative
with
his
shrill
Italian
parody
on
an
English
cheer
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
mother
rose
the
moment
he
had
done
,
with
flushed
cheeks
and
brightened
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
caught
the
little
man
warmly
by
both
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
good
Pesca
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
never
doubted
your
true
affection
for
Walter
 
<EOS>
but
I
am
more
than
ever
persuaded
of
it
now
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
we
are
very
much
obliged
to
Professor
Pesca
,
for
Walter
's
sake
,
"
added
Sarah
.
<EOS>
She
half
rose
,
while
she
spoke
,
as
if
to
approach
the
arm
-
chair
,
in
her
turn
;
but
,
observing
that
Pesca
was
rapturously
kissing
my
mother
's
hands
,
looked
serious
,
and
resumed
her
seat
.
<EOS>
"
If
the
familiar
little
man
treats
my
mother
in
that
way
,
how
will
he
treat
ME
?
"
<EOS>
Faces
sometimes
tell
truth
;
and
that
was
unquestionably
the
thought
in
Sarah
's
mind
,
as
she
sat
down
again
.
  
<EOS>
Although
I
myself
was
gratefully
sensible
of
the
kindness
of
Pesca
's
motives
,
my
spirits
were
hardly
so
much
elevated
as
they
ought
to
have
been
by
the
prospect
of
future
employment
now
placed
before
me
.
<EOS>
When
the
Professor
had
quite
done
with
my
mother
's
hand
,
and
when
I
had
warmly
thanked
him
for
his
interference
on
my
behalf
,
I
asked
to
be
allowed
to
look
at
the
note
of
terms
which
his
respectable
patron
had
drawn
up
for
my
inspection
.
  
<EOS>
Pesca
handed
me
the
paper
,
with
a
triumphant
flourish
of
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Read
!
"
said
the
little
man
majestically
.
<EOS>
"
I
promise
you
my
friend
,
the
writing
of
the
golden
Papa
speaks
with
a
tongue
of
trumpets
for
itself
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
note
of
terms
was
plain
,
straightforward
,
and
comprehensive
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
It
informed
me
,
  
First
,
That
Frederick
Fairlie
,
Esquire
,
of
Limmeridge
House
.
<EOS>
Cumberland
,
wanted
to
engage
the
services
of
a
thoroughly
competent
drawing
-
master
,
for
a
period
of
four
months
certain
.
  
<EOS>
Secondly
,
That
the
duties
which
the
master
was
expected
to
perform
would
be
of
a
twofold
kind
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
superintend
the
instruction
of
two
young
ladies
in
the
art
of
painting
in
water
-
colours
;
and
he
was
to
devote
his
leisure
time
,
afterwards
,
to
the
business
of
repairing
and
mounting
a
valuable
collection
of
drawings
,
which
had
been
suffered
to
fall
into
a
condition
of
total
neglect
.
  
<EOS>
Thirdly
,
That
the
terms
offered
to
the
person
who
should
undertake
and
properly
perform
these
duties
were
four
guineas
a
week
;
that
he
was
to
reside
at
Limmeridge
House
;
and
that
he
was
to
be
treated
there
on
the
footing
of
a
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
Fourthly
,
and
lastly
,
That
no
person
need
think
of
applying
for
this
situation
unless
he
could
furnish
the
most
unexceptionable
references
to
character
and
abilities
.
<EOS>
The
references
were
to
be
sent
to
Mr.
Fairlie
's
friend
in
London
,
who
was
empowered
to
conclude
all
necessary
arrangements
.
<EOS>
These
instructions
were
followed
by
the
name
and
address
of
Pesca
's
employer
in
Portland
Place
 
and
there
the
note
,
or
memorandum
,
ended
.
  
<EOS>
The
prospect
which
this
offer
of
an
engagement
held
out
was
certainly
an
attractive
one
.
<EOS>
The
employment
was
likely
to
be
both
easy
and
agreeable
;
it
was
proposed
to
me
at
the
autumn
time
of
the
year
when
I
was
least
occupied
;
and
the
terms
,
judging
by
my
personal
experience
in
my
profession
,
were
surprisingly
liberal
.
<EOS>
I
knew
this
;
I
knew
that
I
ought
to
consider
myself
very
fortunate
if
I
succeeded
in
securing
the
offered
employment
 
and
yet
,
no
sooner
had
I
read
the
memorandum
than
I
felt
an
inexplicable
unwillingness
within
me
to
stir
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
had
never
in
the
whole
of
my
previous
experience
found
my
duty
and
my
inclination
so
painfully
and
so
unaccountably
at
variance
as
I
found
them
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Walter
,
your
father
never
had
such
a
chance
as
this
!
"
said
my
mother
,
when
she
had
read
the
note
of
terms
and
had
handed
it
back
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Such
distinguished
people
to
know
,
"
remarked
Sarah
,
straightening
herself
in
the
chair
;
"
and
on
such
gratifying
terms
of
equality
too
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
;
the
terms
,
in
every
sense
,
are
tempting
enough
,
"
I
replied
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
But
before
I
send
in
my
testimonials
,
I
should
like
a
little
time
to
consider
 
"
  
"
Consider
!
"
exclaimed
my
mother
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
Walter
,
what
is
the
matter
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Consider
!
"
echoed
my
sister
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
a
very
extraordinary
thing
to
say
,
under
the
circumstances
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Consider
!
"
<EOS>
chimed
in
the
Professor
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
there
to
consider
about
?
<EOS>
Answer
me
this
!
<EOS>
Have
you
not
been
complaining
of
your
health
,
and
have
you
not
been
longing
for
what
you
call
a
smack
of
the
country
breeze
?
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
there
in
your
hand
is
the
paper
that
offers
you
perpetual
choking
mouthfuls
of
country
breeze
for
four
months
'
time
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
so
?
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
Again
 
you
want
money
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
Is
four
golden
guineas
a
week
nothing
?
<EOS>
My
-
soul
-
bless
-
my
-
soul
!
<EOS>
only
give
it
to
me
 
and
my
boots
shall
creak
like
the
golden
Papa
's
,
with
a
sense
of
the
overpowering
richness
of
the
man
who
walks
in
them
!
<EOS>
Four
guineas
a
week
,
and
,
more
than
that
,
the
charming
society
of
two
young
misses
!
<EOS>
and
,
more
than
that
,
your
bed
,
your
breakfast
,
your
dinner
,
your
gorging
English
teas
and
lunches
and
drinks
of
foaming
beer
,
all
for
nothing
 
<EOS>
why
,
Walter
,
my
dear
good
friend
 
deuce
-
what
-
the
-
deuce
!
 
<EOS>
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
I
have
not
eyes
enough
in
my
head
to
look
,
and
wonder
at
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Neither
my
mother
's
evident
astonishment
at
my
behaviour
,
nor
Pesca
's
fervid
enumeration
of
the
advantages
offered
to
me
by
the
new
employment
,
had
any
effect
in
shaking
my
unreasonable
disinclination
to
go
to
Limmeridge
House
.
<EOS>
After
starting
all
the
petty
objections
that
I
could
think
of
to
going
to
Cumberland
,
and
after
hearing
them
answered
,
one
after
another
,
to
my
own
complete
discomfiture
,
I
tried
to
set
up
a
last
obstacle
by
asking
what
was
to
become
of
my
pupils
in
London
while
I
was
teaching
Mr.
Fairlie
's
young
ladies
to
sketch
from
nature
.
<EOS>
The
obvious
answer
to
this
was
,
that
the
greater
part
of
them
would
be
away
on
their
autumn
travels
,
and
that
the
few
who
remained
at
home
might
be
confided
to
the
care
of
one
of
my
brother
drawing
-
masters
,
whose
pupils
I
had
once
taken
off
his
hands
under
similar
circumstances
.
<EOS>
My
sister
reminded
me
that
this
gentleman
had
expressly
placed
his
services
at
my
disposal
,
during
the
present
season
,
in
case
I
wished
to
leave
town
;
my
mother
seriously
appealed
to
me
not
to
let
an
idle
caprice
stand
in
the
way
of
my
own
interests
and
my
own
health
;
and
Pesca
piteously
entreated
that
I
would
not
wound
him
to
the
heart
by
rejecting
the
first
grateful
offer
of
service
that
he
had
been
able
to
make
to
the
friend
who
had
saved
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
The
evident
sincerity
and
affection
which
inspired
these
remonstrances
would
have
influenced
any
man
with
an
atom
of
good
feeling
in
his
composition
.
<EOS>
Though
I
could
not
conquer
my
own
unaccountable
perversity
,
I
had
at
least
virtue
enough
to
be
heartily
ashamed
of
it
,
and
to
end
the
discussion
pleasantly
by
giving
way
,
and
promising
to
do
all
that
was
wanted
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
evening
passed
merrily
enough
in
humorous
anticipations
of
my
coming
life
with
the
two
young
ladies
in
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
Pesca
,
inspired
by
our
national
grog
,
which
appeared
to
get
into
his
head
,
in
the
most
marvellous
manner
,
five
minutes
after
it
had
gone
down
his
throat
,
asserted
his
claims
to
be
considered
a
complete
Englishman
by
making
a
series
of
speeches
in
rapid
succession
,
proposing
my
mother
's
health
,
my
sister
's
health
,
my
health
,
and
the
healths
,
in
mass
,
of
Mr.
Fairlie
and
the
two
young
Misses
,
pathetically
returning
thanks
himself
,
immediately
afterwards
,
for
the
whole
party
.
<EOS>
"
A
secret
,
Walter
,
"
said
my
little
friend
confidentially
,
as
we
walked
home
together
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
flushed
by
the
recollection
of
my
own
eloquence
.
<EOS>
My
soul
bursts
itself
with
ambition
.
<EOS>
One
of
these
days
I
go
into
your
noble
Parliament
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
dream
of
my
whole
life
to
be
Honourable
Pesca
,
M.P.
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
I
sent
my
testimonials
to
the
Professor
's
employer
in
Portland
Place
.
<EOS>
Three
days
passed
,
and
I
concluded
,
with
secret
satisfaction
,
that
my
papers
had
not
been
found
sufficiently
explicit
.
<EOS>
On
the
fourth
day
,
however
,
an
answer
came
.
<EOS>
It
announced
that
Mr.
Fairlie
accepted
my
services
,
and
requested
me
to
start
for
Cumberland
immediately
.
<EOS>
All
the
necessary
instructions
for
my
journey
were
carefully
and
clearly
added
in
a
postscript
.
  
<EOS>
I
made
my
arrangements
,
unwillingly
enough
,
for
leaving
London
early
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
Towards
evening
Pesca
looked
in
,
on
his
way
to
a
dinner
-
party
,
to
bid
me
good
-
bye
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
dry
my
tears
in
your
absence
,
"
said
the
Professor
gaily
,
"
with
this
glorious
thought
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
auspicious
hand
that
has
given
the
first
push
to
your
fortune
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Go
,
my
friend
!
<EOS>
When
your
sun
shines
in
Cumberland
(
English
proverb
)
,
in
the
name
of
heaven
make
your
hay
.
<EOS>
Marry
one
of
the
two
young
Misses
;
become
Honourable
Hartright
,
M.P.
;
and
when
you
are
on
the
top
of
the
ladder
remember
that
Pesca
,
at
the
bottom
,
has
done
it
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
tried
to
laugh
with
my
little
friend
over
his
parting
jest
,
but
my
spirits
were
not
to
be
commanded
.
<EOS>
Something
jarred
in
me
almost
painfully
while
he
was
speaking
his
light
farewell
words
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
was
left
alone
again
nothing
remained
to
be
done
but
to
walk
to
the
Hampstead
cottage
and
bid
my
mother
and
Sarah
good
-
bye
.
    
<EOS>
The
heat
had
been
painfully
oppressive
all
day
,
and
it
was
now
a
close
and
sultry
night
.
  
<EOS>
My
mother
and
sister
had
spoken
so
many
last
words
,
and
had
begged
me
to
wait
another
five
minutes
so
many
times
,
that
it
was
nearly
midnight
when
the
servant
locked
the
garden
-
gate
behind
me
.
<EOS>
I
walked
forward
a
few
paces
on
the
shortest
way
back
to
London
,
then
stopped
and
hesitated
.
  
<EOS>
The
moon
was
full
and
broad
in
the
dark
blue
starless
sky
,
and
the
broken
ground
of
the
heath
looked
wild
enough
in
the
mysterious
light
to
be
hundreds
of
miles
away
from
the
great
city
that
lay
beneath
it
.
<EOS>
The
idea
of
descending
any
sooner
than
I
could
help
into
the
heat
and
gloom
of
London
repelled
me
.
<EOS>
The
prospect
of
going
to
bed
in
my
airless
chambers
,
and
the
prospect
of
gradual
suffocation
,
seemed
,
in
my
present
restless
frame
of
mind
and
body
,
to
be
one
and
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
I
determined
to
stroll
home
in
the
purer
air
by
the
most
roundabout
way
I
could
take
;
to
follow
the
white
winding
paths
across
the
lonely
heath
;
and
to
approach
London
through
its
most
open
suburb
by
striking
into
the
Finchley
Road
,
and
so
getting
back
,
in
the
cool
of
the
new
morning
,
by
the
western
side
of
the
Regent
's
Park
.
  
<EOS>
I
wound
my
way
down
slowly
over
the
heath
,
enjoying
the
divine
stillness
of
the
scene
,
and
admiring
the
soft
alternations
of
light
and
shade
as
they
followed
each
other
over
the
broken
ground
on
every
side
of
me
.
<EOS>
So
long
as
I
was
proceeding
through
this
first
and
prettiest
part
of
my
night
walk
my
mind
remained
passively
open
to
the
impressions
produced
by
the
view
;
and
I
thought
but
little
on
any
subject
 
indeed
,
so
far
as
my
own
sensations
were
concerned
,
I
can
hardly
say
that
I
thought
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
I
had
left
the
heath
and
had
turned
into
the
by
-
road
,
where
there
was
less
to
see
,
the
ideas
naturally
engendered
by
the
approaching
change
in
my
habits
and
occupations
gradually
drew
more
and
more
of
my
attention
exclusively
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
I
had
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
road
I
had
become
completely
absorbed
in
my
own
fanciful
visions
of
Limmeridge
House
,
of
Mr.
Fairlie
,
and
of
the
two
ladies
whose
practice
in
the
art
of
water
-
colour
painting
I
was
so
soon
to
superintend
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
now
arrived
at
that
particular
point
of
my
walk
where
four
roads
met
 
the
road
to
Hampstead
,
along
which
I
had
returned
,
the
road
to
Finchley
,
the
road
to
West
End
,
and
the
road
back
to
London
.
<EOS>
I
had
mechanically
turned
in
this
latter
direction
,
and
was
strolling
along
the
lonely
high
-
road
 
idly
wondering
<EOS>
,
I
remember
,
what
the
Cumberland
young
ladies
would
look
like
 
when
,
in
one
moment
,
every
drop
of
blood
in
my
body
was
brought
to
a
stop
by
the
touch
of
a
hand
laid
lightly
and
suddenly
on
my
shoulder
from
behind
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
turned
on
the
instant
,
with
my
fingers
tightening
round
the
handle
of
my
stick
.
  
<EOS>
There
,
in
the
middle
of
the
broad
bright
high
-
road
 
there
,
as
if
it
had
that
moment
sprung
out
of
the
earth
or
dropped
from
the
heaven
 
stood
the
figure
of
a
solitary
Woman
,
dressed
from
head
to
foot
in
white
garments
,
her
face
bent
in
grave
inquiry
on
mine
,
her
hand
pointing
to
the
dark
cloud
over
London
,
as
I
faced
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
far
too
seriously
startled
by
the
suddenness
with
which
this
extraordinary
apparition
stood
before
me
,
in
the
dead
of
night
and
in
that
lonely
place
,
to
ask
what
she
wanted
.
<EOS>
The
strange
woman
spoke
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
the
road
to
London
?
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
I
looked
attentively
at
her
,
as
she
put
that
singular
question
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
nearly
one
o'clock
.
<EOS>
All
I
could
discern
distinctly
by
the
moonlight
was
a
colourless
,
youthful
face
,
meagre
and
sharp
to
look
at
about
the
cheeks
and
chin
;
large
,
grave
,
wistfully
attentive
eyes
;
nervous
,
uncertain
lips
;
and
light
hair
of
a
pale
,
brownish
-
yellow
hue
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
wild
,
nothing
immodest
in
her
manner
:
it
was
quiet
and
self
-
controlled
,
a
little
melancholy
and
a
little
touched
by
suspicion
;
not
exactly
the
manner
of
a
lady
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
not
the
manner
of
a
woman
in
the
humblest
rank
of
life
.
<EOS>
The
voice
,
little
as
I
had
yet
heard
of
it
,
had
something
curiously
still
and
mechanical
in
its
tones
,
and
the
utterance
was
remarkably
rapid
.
<EOS>
She
held
a
small
bag
in
her
hand
:
and
her
dress
 
bonnet
,
shawl
,
and
gown
all
of
white
 
was
,
so
far
as
I
could
guess
,
certainly
not
composed
of
very
delicate
or
very
expensive
materials
.
<EOS>
Her
figure
was
slight
,
and
rather
above
the
average
height
 
her
gait
and
actions
free
from
the
slightest
approach
to
extravagance
.
<EOS>
This
was
all
that
I
could
observe
of
her
in
the
dim
light
and
under
the
perplexingly
strange
circumstances
of
our
meeting
.
<EOS>
What
sort
of
a
woman
she
was
,
and
how
she
came
to
be
out
alone
in
the
high
-
road
,
an
hour
after
midnight
,
I
altogether
failed
to
guess
.
<EOS>
The
one
thing
of
which
I
felt
certain
was
,
that
the
grossest
of
mankind
could
not
have
misconstrued
her
motive
in
speaking
,
even
at
that
suspiciously
late
hour
and
in
that
suspiciously
lonely
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
hear
me
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
still
quietly
and
rapidly
,
and
without
the
least
fretfulness
or
impatience
.
<EOS>
"
I
asked
if
that
was
the
way
to
London
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
replied
,
"
that
is
the
way
:
it
leads
to
St.
John
's
Wood
and
the
Regent
's
Park
.
<EOS>
You
must
excuse
my
not
answering
you
before
.
<EOS>
I
was
rather
startled
by
your
sudden
appearance
in
the
road
;
and
I
am
,
even
now
,
quite
unable
to
account
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
suspect
me
of
doing
anything
wrong
,
do
you
?
<EOS>
I
have
done
nothing
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
have
met
with
an
accident
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
unfortunate
in
being
here
alone
so
late
.
<EOS>
Why
do
you
suspect
me
of
doing
wrong
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
spoke
with
unnecessary
earnestness
and
agitation
,
and
shrank
back
from
me
several
paces
.
<EOS>
I
did
my
best
to
reassure
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
suppose
that
I
have
any
idea
of
suspecting
you
,
"
I
said
,
"
or
any
other
wish
than
to
be
of
assistance
to
you
,
if
I
can
.
<EOS>
I
only
wondered
at
your
appearance
in
the
road
,
because
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
empty
the
instant
before
I
saw
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
turned
,
and
pointed
back
to
a
place
at
the
junction
of
the
road
to
London
and
the
road
to
Hampstead
,
where
there
was
a
gap
in
the
hedge
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
heard
you
coming
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
hid
there
to
see
what
sort
of
man
you
were
,
before
I
risked
speaking
.
<EOS>
I
doubted
and
feared
about
it
till
you
passed
;
and
then
I
was
obliged
to
steal
after
you
,
and
touch
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Steal
after
me
and
touch
me
?
<EOS>
Why
not
call
to
me
?
<EOS>
Strange
,
to
say
the
least
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
trust
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
think
the
worse
of
me
because
I
have
met
with
an
accident
?
"
<EOS>
She
stopped
in
confusion
;
shifted
her
bag
from
one
hand
to
the
other
;
and
sighed
bitterly
.
  
<EOS>
The
loneliness
and
helplessness
of
the
woman
touched
me
.
<EOS>
The
natural
impulse
to
assist
her
and
to
spare
her
got
the
better
of
the
judgment
,
the
caution
,
the
worldly
tact
,
which
an
older
,
wiser
,
and
colder
man
might
have
summoned
to
help
him
in
this
strange
emergency
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
trust
me
for
any
harmless
purpose
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
If
it
troubles
you
to
explain
your
strange
situation
to
me
,
do
n't
think
of
returning
to
the
subject
again
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
to
ask
you
for
any
explanations
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
how
I
can
help
you
;
and
if
I
can
,
I
will
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
kind
,
and
I
am
very
,
very
thankful
to
have
met
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
first
touch
of
womanly
tenderness
that
I
had
heard
from
her
trembled
in
her
voice
as
she
said
the
words
;
but
no
tears
glistened
in
those
large
,
wistfully
attentive
eyes
of
hers
,
which
were
still
fixed
on
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
been
in
London
once
before
,
"
she
went
on
,
more
and
more
rapidly
,
"
and
I
know
nothing
about
that
side
of
it
,
yonder
.
<EOS>
Can
I
get
a
fly
,
or
a
carriage
of
any
kind
?
<EOS>
Is
it
too
late
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
If
you
could
show
me
where
to
get
a
fly
 
and
if
you
will
only
promise
not
to
interfere
with
me
,
and
to
let
me
leave
you
,
when
and
how
I
please
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
friend
in
London
who
will
be
glad
to
receive
me
 
<EOS>
I
want
nothing
else
 
<EOS>
will
you
promise
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
anxiously
up
and
down
the
road
;
shifted
her
bag
again
from
one
hand
to
the
other
;
repeated
the
words
,
"
Will
you
promise
?
"
and
looked
hard
in
my
face
,
with
a
pleading
fear
and
confusion
that
it
troubled
me
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
What
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
Here
was
a
stranger
utterly
and
helplessly
at
my
mercy
 
and
that
stranger
a
forlorn
woman
.
<EOS>
No
house
was
near
;
no
one
was
passing
whom
I
could
consult
;
and
no
earthly
right
existed
on
my
part
to
give
me
a
power
of
control
over
her
,
even
if
I
had
known
how
to
exercise
it
.
<EOS>
I
trace
these
lines
,
self
-
distrustfully
,
with
the
shadows
of
after
-
events
darkening
the
very
paper
I
write
on
;
and
still
I
say
,
what
could
I
do
?
  
<EOS>
What
I
did
do
,
was
to
try
and
gain
time
by
questioning
her
.
"
<EOS>
Are
you
sure
that
your
friend
in
London
will
receive
you
at
such
a
late
hour
as
this
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
sure
.
<EOS>
Only
say
you
will
let
me
leave
you
when
and
how
<EOS>
I
please
 
<EOS>
only
say
you
wo
n't
interfere
with
me
.
<EOS>
Will
you
promise
?
"
  
<EOS>
As
she
repeated
the
words
for
the
third
time
,
she
came
close
to
me
and
laid
her
hand
,
with
a
sudden
gentle
stealthiness
,
on
my
bosom
 
<EOS>
a
thin
hand
;
a
cold
hand
(
when
I
removed
it
with
mine
)
even
on
that
sultry
night
.
<EOS>
Remember
that
I
was
young
;
remember
that
the
hand
which
touched
me
was
a
woman
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
promise
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
One
word
!
<EOS>
The
little
familiar
word
that
is
on
everybody
's
lips
,
every
hour
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
Oh
me
!
<EOS>
and
I
tremble
,
now
,
when
I
write
it
.
  
<EOS>
We
set
our
faces
towards
London
,
and
walked
on
together
in
the
first
still
hour
of
the
new
day
 
I
,
and
this
woman
,
whose
name
,
whose
character
,
whose
story
,
whose
objects
in
life
,
whose
very
presence
by
my
side
,
at
that
moment
,
were
fathomless
mysteries
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
like
a
dream
.
<EOS>
Was
I
Walter
Hartright
?
<EOS>
Was
this
the
well
-
known
,
uneventful
road
,
where
holiday
people
strolled
on
Sundays
?
<EOS>
Had
I
really
left
,
little
more
than
an
hour
since
,
the
quiet
,
decent
,
conventionally
domestic
atmosphere
of
my
mother
's
cottage
?
<EOS>
I
was
too
bewildered
 
<EOS>
too
conscious
also
of
a
vague
sense
of
something
like
self
-
reproach
 
to
speak
to
my
strange
companion
for
some
minutes
.
<EOS>
It
was
her
voice
again
that
first
broke
the
silence
between
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
ask
you
something
,
"
she
said
suddenly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
many
people
in
London
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
a
great
many
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Many
men
of
rank
and
title
?
<EOS>
"
There
was
an
unmistakable
tone
of
suspicion
in
the
strange
question
.
<EOS>
I
hesitated
about
answering
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Some
,
"
I
said
,
after
a
moment
's
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Many
"
 
<EOS>
she
came
to
a
full
stop
,
and
looked
me
searchingly
in
the
face
 
"
many
men
of
the
rank
of
Baronet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Too
much
astonished
to
reply
,
I
questioned
her
in
my
turn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
ask
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
hope
,
for
my
own
sake
,
there
is
one
Baronet
that
you
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
tell
me
his
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
 
I
dare
n't
 
<EOS>
I
forget
myself
when
I
mention
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
spoke
loudly
and
almost
fiercely
,
raised
her
clenched
hand
in
the
air
,
and
shook
it
passionately
;
then
,
on
a
sudden
,
controlled
herself
again
,
and
added
,
in
tones
lowered
to
a
whisper
"
<EOS>
Tell
me
which
of
them
YOU
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
could
hardly
refuse
to
humour
her
in
such
a
trifle
,
and
I
mentioned
three
names
.
<EOS>
Two
,
the
names
of
fathers
of
families
whose
daughters
I
taught
;
one
,
the
name
of
a
bachelor
who
had
once
taken
me
a
cruise
in
his
yacht
,
to
make
sketches
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
DON'T
know
him
,
"
she
said
,
with
a
sigh
of
relief
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
a
man
of
rank
and
title
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Far
from
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
only
a
drawing
-
master
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
the
reply
passed
my
lips
 
a
little
bitterly
,
perhaps
 
she
took
my
arm
with
the
abruptness
which
characterised
all
her
actions
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
man
of
rank
and
title
,
"
she
repeated
to
herself
.
"
<EOS>
Thank
God
!
<EOS>
I
may
trust
HIM
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
hitherto
contrived
to
master
my
curiosity
out
of
consideration
for
my
companion
;
but
it
got
the
better
of
me
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
you
have
serious
reason
to
complain
of
some
man
of
rank
and
title
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
the
baronet
,
whose
name
you
are
unwilling
to
mention
to
me
,
has
done
you
some
grievous
wrong
?
<EOS>
Is
he
the
cause
of
<EOS>
your
being
out
here
at
this
strange
time
of
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
ask
me
:
do
n't
make
me
talk
of
it
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
fit
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
cruelly
used
and
cruelly
wronged
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
kinder
than
ever
,
if
you
will
walk
on
fast
,
and
not
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
sadly
want
to
quiet
myself
,
if
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
moved
forward
again
at
a
quick
pace
;
and
for
half
an
hour
,
at
least
,
not
a
word
passed
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
From
time
to
time
,
being
forbidden
to
make
any
more
inquiries
,
I
stole
a
look
at
her
face
.
<EOS>
It
was
always
the
same
;
the
lips
close
shut
,
the
brow
frowning
,
the
eyes
looking
straight
forward
,
eagerly
and
yet
absently
.
<EOS>
We
had
reached
the
first
houses
,
and
were
close
on
the
new
Wesleyan
college
,
before
her
set
features
relaxed
and
she
spoke
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
live
in
London
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
As
I
answered
,
it
struck
me
that
she
might
have
formed
some
intention
of
appealing
to
me
for
assistance
or
advice
,
and
that
I
ought
to
spare
her
a
possible
disappointment
by
warning
her
of
my
approaching
absence
from
home
.
<EOS>
So
I
added
,
"
But
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
shall
be
away
from
London
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
into
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
she
asked
.
<EOS>
"
North
or
south
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
North
 
to
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cumberland
!
"
<EOS>
she
repeated
the
word
tenderly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
wish
I
was
going
there
too
.
<EOS>
I
was
once
happy
in
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
tried
again
to
lift
the
veil
that
hung
between
this
woman
and
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
were
born
,
"
I
said
,
"
in
the
beautiful
Lake
country
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
born
in
Hampshire
;
but
I
once
went
to
school
for
a
little
while
in
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
Lakes
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
remember
any
lakes
.
<EOS>
It
's
Limmeridge
village
,
and
Limmeridge
House
,
I
should
like
to
see
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
my
turn
now
to
stop
suddenly
.
<EOS>
In
the
excited
state
of
my
curiosity
,
at
that
moment
,
the
chance
reference
to
Mr.
Fairlie
's
place
of
residence
,
on
the
lips
of
my
strange
companion
,
staggered
me
with
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
hear
anybody
calling
after
us
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
looking
up
and
down
the
road
affrightedly
,
the
instant
I
stopped
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
.
<EOS>
I
was
only
struck
by
the
name
of
Limmeridge
House
.
<EOS>
I
heard
it
mentioned
by
some
Cumberland
people
a
few
days
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
!
not
my
people
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairlie
is
dead
;
and
her
husband
is
dead
;
and
their
little
girl
may
be
married
and
gone
away
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
who
lives
at
Limmeridge
now
.
<EOS>
If
any
more
are
left
there
of
that
name
,
I
only
know
I
love
them
for
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
seemed
about
to
say
more
;
but
while
she
was
speaking
,
we
came
within
view
of
the
turnpike
,
at
the
top
of
the
Avenue
Road
.
<EOS>
Her
hand
tightened
round
my
arm
,
and
she
looked
anxiously
at
the
gate
before
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
the
turnpike
man
looking
out
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
not
looking
out
;
no
one
else
was
near
the
place
when
we
passed
through
the
gate
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
the
gas
-
lamps
and
houses
seemed
to
agitate
her
,
and
to
make
her
impatient
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
London
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
see
any
carriage
I
can
get
?
<EOS>
I
am
tired
and
frightened
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
shut
myself
in
and
be
driven
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
explained
to
her
that
we
must
walk
a
little
further
to
get
to
a
cab
-
stand
,
unless
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
meet
with
an
empty
vehicle
;
and
then
tried
to
resume
the
subject
of
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
It
was
useless
.
<EOS>
That
idea
of
shutting
herself
in
,
and
being
driven
away
,
had
now
got
full
possession
of
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
could
think
and
talk
of
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
hardly
proceeded
a
third
of
the
way
down
the
Avenue
Road
when
I
saw
a
cab
draw
up
at
a
house
a
few
doors
below
us
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
A
gentleman
got
out
and
let
himself
in
at
the
garden
door
.
<EOS>
I
hailed
the
cab
,
as
the
driver
mounted
the
box
again
.
<EOS>
When
we
crossed
the
road
,
my
companion
's
impatience
increased
to
such
an
extent
that
she
almost
forced
me
to
run
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
so
late
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
only
in
a
hurry
because
it
's
so
late
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
take
you
,
sir
,
if
you
're
not
going
towards
Tottenham
Court
Road
,
"
said
the
driver
civilly
,
when
I
opened
the
cab
door
.
<EOS>
"
My
horse
is
dead
beat
,
and
I
ca
n't
get
him
no
further
than
the
stable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
.
<EOS>
That
will
do
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
'm
going
that
way
 
<EOS>
I
'm
going
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
She
spoke
with
breathless
eagerness
,
and
pressed
by
me
into
the
cab
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
assured
myself
that
the
man
was
sober
as
well
as
civil
before
I
let
her
enter
the
vehicle
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
when
she
was
seated
inside
,
I
entreated
her
to
let
me
see
her
set
down
safely
at
her
destination
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
,
"
she
said
vehemently
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
quite
safe
,
and
quite
happy
now
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
a
gentleman
,
remember
your
promise
.
<EOS>
Let
him
drive
on
till
I
stop
him
.
<EOS>
Thank
you
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
thank
you
,
thank
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
My
hand
was
on
the
cab
door
.
<EOS>
She
caught
it
in
hers
,
kissed
it
,
and
pushed
it
away
.
<EOS>
The
cab
drove
off
at
the
same
moment
 
I
started
into
the
road
,
with
some
vague
idea
of
stopping
it
again
,
I
hardly
knew
why
 
hesitated
from
dread
of
frightening
and
distressing
her
 
called
,
at
last
,
but
not
loudly
enough
to
attract
the
driver
's
attention
.
<EOS>
The
sound
of
the
wheels
grew
fainter
in
the
distance
 
the
cab
melted
into
the
black
shadows
on
the
road
 
<EOS>
the
woman
in
white
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
Ten
minutes
or
more
had
passed
.
<EOS>
I
was
still
on
the
same
side
of
the
way
;
now
mechanically
walking
forward
a
few
paces
;
now
stopping
again
absently
.
<EOS>
At
one
moment
I
found
myself
doubting
the
reality
of
my
own
adventure
;
at
another
I
was
perplexed
and
distressed
by
an
uneasy
sense
of
having
done
wrong
,
which
yet
left
me
confusedly
ignorant
of
how
I
could
have
done
right
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
knew
where
I
was
going
,
or
what
I
meant
to
do
next
;
I
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
the
confusion
of
my
own
thoughts
,
when
I
was
abruptly
recalled
to
myself
 
<EOS>
awakened
<EOS>
,
I
might
almost
say
 
by
the
sound
of
rapidly
approaching
wheels
close
behind
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
on
the
dark
side
of
the
road
,
in
the
thick
shadow
of
some
garden
trees
,
when
I
stopped
to
look
round
.
<EOS>
On
the
opposite
and
lighter
side
of
the
way
,
a
short
distance
below
me
,
a
policeman
was
strolling
along
in
the
direction
of
the
Regent
's
Park
.
  
<EOS>
The
carriage
passed
me
 
an
open
chaise
driven
by
two
men
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
<EOS>
cried
one
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
policeman
.
<EOS>
Let
's
ask
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
horse
was
instantly
pulled
up
,
a
few
yards
beyond
the
dark
place
where
I
stood
.
  
<EOS>
"
Policeman
!
"
cried
the
first
speaker
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
a
woman
pass
this
way
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
sort
of
woman
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
woman
in
a
lavender
-
coloured
gown
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
no
,
"
interposed
the
second
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
clothes
we
gave
her
were
found
on
her
bed
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
gone
away
in
the
clothes
she
wore
when
she
came
to
us
.
<EOS>
In
white
,
policeman
.
<EOS>
A
woman
in
white
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
seen
her
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
or
any
of
your
men
meet
with
the
woman
,
stop
her
,
and
send
her
in
careful
keeping
to
that
address
.
<EOS>
I
'll
pay
all
expenses
,
and
a
fair
reward
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
policeman
looked
at
the
card
that
was
handed
down
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
are
we
to
stop
her
,
sir
?
<EOS>
What
has
she
done
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Done
!
<EOS>
She
has
escaped
from
my
Asylum
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
forget
;
a
woman
in
white
.
<EOS>
Drive
on
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
She
has
escaped
from
my
Asylum
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
with
truth
that
the
terrible
inference
which
those
words
suggested
flashed
upon
me
like
a
new
revelation
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
strange
questions
put
to
me
by
the
woman
in
white
,
after
my
ill
-
considered
promise
to
leave
her
free
to
act
as
she
pleased
,
had
suggested
the
conclusion
either
that
she
was
naturally
flighty
and
unsettled
,
or
that
some
recent
shock
of
terror
had
disturbed
the
balance
of
her
faculties
.
<EOS>
But
the
idea
of
absolute
insanity
which
we
all
associate
with
the
very
name
of
an
Asylum
,
had
,
I
can
honestly
declare
,
never
occurred
to
me
,
in
connection
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
had
seen
nothing
,
in
her
language
or
her
actions
,
to
justify
it
at
the
time
;
and
even
with
the
new
light
thrown
on
her
by
the
words
which
the
stranger
had
addressed
to
the
policeman
,
I
could
see
nothing
to
justify
it
now
.
  
<EOS>
What
had
I
done
?
<EOS>
Assisted
the
victim
of
the
most
horrible
of
all
false
imprisonments
to
escape
;
or
cast
loose
on
the
wide
world
of
London
an
unfortunate
creature
,
whose
actions
it
was
my
duty
,
and
every
man
's
duty
,
mercifully
to
control
?
<EOS>
I
turned
sick
at
heart
when
the
question
occurred
to
me
,
and
when
I
felt
self
-
reproachfully
that
it
was
asked
too
late
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
disturbed
state
of
my
mind
,
it
was
useless
to
think
of
going
to
bed
,
when
I
at
last
got
back
to
my
chambers
in
Clement
's
Inn
.
<EOS>
Before
many
hours
elapsed
it
would
be
necessary
to
start
on
my
journey
to
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
I
sat
down
and
tried
,
first
to
sketch
,
then
to
read
 
but
the
woman
in
white
got
between
me
and
my
pencil
,
between
me
and
my
book
.
<EOS>
Had
the
forlorn
creature
come
to
any
harm
?
<EOS>
That
was
my
first
thought
,
though
I
shrank
selfishly
from
confronting
it
.
<EOS>
Other
thoughts
followed
,
on
which
it
was
less
harrowing
to
dwell
.
<EOS>
Where
had
she
stopped
the
cab
?
<EOS>
What
had
become
of
her
now
?
<EOS>
Had
she
been
traced
and
captured
by
the
men
in
the
chaise
?
<EOS>
Or
was
she
still
capable
of
controlling
her
own
actions
;
and
were
we
two
following
our
widely
parted
roads
towards
one
point
in
the
mysterious
future
,
at
which
we
were
to
meet
once
more
?
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
relief
when
the
hour
came
to
lock
my
door
,
to
bid
farewell
to
London
pursuits
,
London
pupils
,
and
London
friends
,
and
to
be
in
movement
again
towards
new
interests
and
a
new
life
.
<EOS>
Even
the
bustle
and
confusion
at
the
railway
terminus
,
<EOS>
so
wearisome
and
bewildering
at
other
times
,
roused
me
and
did
me
good
.
  
<EOS>
My
travelling
instructions
directed
me
to
go
to
Carlisle
,
and
then
to
diverge
by
a
branch
railway
which
ran
in
the
direction
of
the
coast
.
<EOS>
As
a
misfortune
to
begin
with
,
our
engine
broke
down
between
Lancaster
and
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
The
delay
occasioned
by
this
accident
caused
me
to
be
too
late
for
the
branch
train
,
by
which
I
was
to
have
gone
on
immediately
.
<EOS>
I
had
to
wait
some
hours
;
and
when
a
later
train
finally
deposited
me
at
the
nearest
station
to
Limmeridge
House
,
it
was
past
ten
,
and
the
night
was
so
dark
that
I
could
hardly
see
my
way
to
the
pony
-
chaise
which
Mr.
Fairlie
had
ordered
to
be
in
waiting
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
The
driver
was
evidently
discomposed
by
the
lateness
of
my
arrival
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
that
state
of
highly
respectful
sulkiness
which
is
peculiar
to
English
servants
.
<EOS>
We
drove
away
slowly
through
the
darkness
in
perfect
silence
.
<EOS>
The
roads
were
bad
,
and
the
dense
obscurity
of
the
night
increased
the
difficulty
of
getting
over
the
ground
quickly
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
by
my
watch
,
nearly
an
hour
and
a
half
from
the
time
of
our
leaving
the
station
before
I
heard
the
sound
of
the
sea
in
the
distance
,
and
the
crunch
of
our
wheels
on
a
smooth
gravel
drive
.
<EOS>
We
had
passed
one
gate
before
entering
the
drive
,
and
we
passed
another
before
we
drew
up
at
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
was
received
by
a
solemn
man
-
servant
out
of
livery
,
was
informed
that
the
family
had
retired
for
the
night
,
and
was
then
led
into
a
large
and
lofty
room
where
my
supper
was
awaiting
me
,
in
a
forlorn
manner
,
at
one
extremity
of
a
lonesome
mahogany
wilderness
of
dining
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
too
tired
and
out
of
spirits
to
eat
or
drink
much
,
especially
with
the
solemn
servant
waiting
on
me
as
elaborately
as
if
a
small
dinner
party
had
arrived
at
the
house
instead
of
a
solitary
man
.
<EOS>
In
a
quarter
of
an
hour
I
was
ready
to
be
taken
up
to
my
bedchamber
.
<EOS>
The
solemn
servant
conducted
me
into
a
prettily
furnished
room
 
said
,
"
Breakfast
at
nine
o'clock
,
sir
"
 
looked
all
round
him
to
see
that
everything
was
in
its
proper
place
,
and
noiselessly
withdrew
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
shall
I
see
in
my
dreams
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
I
thought
to
myself
,
as
I
put
out
the
candle
;
"
the
woman
in
white
?
<EOS>
or
the
unknown
inhabitants
of
this
Cumberland
mansion
?
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
strange
sensation
to
be
sleeping
in
the
house
,
like
a
friend
of
the
family
,
and
yet
not
to
know
one
of
the
inmates
,
even
by
sight
!
    
<EOS>
When
I
rose
the
next
morning
and
drew
up
my
blind
,
the
sea
opened
before
me
joyously
under
the
broad
August
sunlight
,
and
the
distant
coast
of
Scotland
fringed
the
horizon
with
its
lines
of
melting
blue
.
  
<EOS>
The
view
was
such
a
surprise
,
and
such
a
change
to
me
,
after
my
weary
London
experience
of
brick
and
mortar
landscape
,
that
I
seemed
to
burst
into
a
new
life
and
a
new
set
of
thoughts
the
moment
I
looked
at
it
.
<EOS>
A
confused
sensation
of
having
suddenly
lost
my
familiarity
with
the
past
,
without
acquiring
any
additional
clearness
of
idea
in
reference
to
the
present
or
the
future
,
took
possession
of
my
mind
.
<EOS>
Circumstances
that
were
but
a
few
days
old
faded
back
in
my
memory
,
as
if
they
had
happened
months
and
months
since
.
<EOS>
Pesca
's
quaint
announcement
of
the
means
by
which
he
had
procured
me
my
present
employment
;
the
farewell
evening
I
had
passed
with
my
mother
and
sister
;
even
my
mysterious
adventure
on
the
way
home
from
Hampstead
 
had
all
become
like
events
which
might
have
occurred
at
some
former
epoch
of
my
existence
.
<EOS>
Although
the
woman
in
white
was
still
in
my
mind
,
the
image
of
her
seemed
to
have
grown
dull
and
faint
already
.
  
<EOS>
A
little
before
nine
o'clock
,
I
descended
to
the
ground
-
floor
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
solemn
man
-
servant
of
the
night
before
met
me
wandering
among
the
passages
,
and
compassionately
showed
me
the
way
to
the
breakfast
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
My
first
glance
round
me
,
as
the
man
opened
the
door
,
disclosed
a
well
-
furnished
breakfast
-
table
,
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
long
room
,
with
many
windows
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
looked
from
the
table
to
the
window
farthest
from
me
,
and
saw
a
lady
standing
at
it
,
with
her
back
turned
towards
me
.
<EOS>
The
instant
my
eyes
rested
on
her
,
I
was
struck
by
the
rare
beauty
of
her
form
,
and
by
the
unaffected
grace
of
her
attitude
.
<EOS>
Her
figure
was
tall
,
yet
not
too
tall
;
comely
and
well
-
developed
,
yet
not
fat
;
her
head
set
on
her
shoulders
with
an
easy
,
pliant
firmness
;
her
waist
,
perfection
in
the
eyes
of
a
man
,
for
it
occupied
its
natural
place
,
it
filled
out
its
natural
circle
,
it
was
visibly
and
delightfully
undeformed
by
stays
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
heard
my
entrance
into
the
room
;
and
I
allowed
myself
the
luxury
of
admiring
her
for
a
few
moments
,
before
I
moved
one
of
the
chairs
near
me
,
as
the
least
embarrassing
means
of
attracting
her
attention
.
<EOS>
She
turned
towards
me
immediately
.
<EOS>
The
easy
elegance
of
every
movement
of
her
limbs
and
body
as
soon
as
she
began
to
advance
from
the
far
end
of
the
room
,
set
me
in
a
flutter
of
expectation
to
see
her
face
clearly
.
<EOS>
She
left
the
window
 
<EOS>
and
I
said
to
myself
,
The
lady
is
dark
.
<EOS>
She
moved
forward
a
few
steps
 
<EOS>
and
I
said
to
myself
,
The
lady
is
young
.
<EOS>
She
approached
nearer
 
<EOS>
and
I
said
to
myself
(
with
a
sense
of
surprise
which
words
fail
me
to
express
)
,
The
lady
is
ugly
!
  
<EOS>
Never
was
the
old
conventional
maxim
,
that
Nature
can
not
err
,
more
flatly
contradicted
 
never
was
the
fair
promise
of
a
lovely
figure
more
strangely
and
startlingly
belied
by
the
face
and
head
that
crowned
it
.
<EOS>
The
lady
's
complexion
was
almost
swarthy
,
and
the
dark
down
on
her
upper
lip
was
almost
a
moustache
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
large
,
firm
,
masculine
mouth
and
jaw
;
prominent
,
piercing
,
resolute
brown
eyes
;
and
thick
,
coal
-
black
hair
,
growing
unusually
low
down
on
her
forehead
.
<EOS>
Her
expression
 
bright
,
frank
,
and
intelligent
 
appeared
,
while
she
was
silent
,
to
be
altogether
wanting
in
those
feminine
attractions
of
gentleness
and
pliability
,
without
which
the
beauty
of
the
handsomest
woman
alive
is
beauty
incomplete
.
<EOS>
To
see
such
a
face
as
this
set
on
shoulders
that
a
sculptor
would
have
longed
to
model
 
to
be
charmed
by
the
modest
graces
of
action
through
which
the
symmetrical
limbs
betrayed
their
beauty
when
they
moved
,
and
then
to
be
almost
repelled
by
the
masculine
form
and
masculine
look
of
the
features
in
which
the
perfectly
shaped
figure
ended
 
was
to
feel
a
sensation
oddly
akin
to
the
helpless
discomfort
familiar
to
us
all
in
sleep
,
when
we
recognise
yet
can
not
reconcile
the
anomalies
and
contradictions
of
a
dream
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Hartright
?
"
said
the
lady
interrogatively
,
her
dark
face
lighting
up
with
a
smile
,
and
softening
and
growing
womanly
the
moment
she
began
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
We
resigned
all
hope
of
you
last
night
,
and
went
to
bed
as
usual
.
<EOS>
Accept
my
apologies
for
our
apparent
want
of
attention
;
and
allow
me
to
introduce
myself
as
one
of
your
pupils
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
shake
hands
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
must
come
to
it
sooner
or
later
 
and
why
not
sooner
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
These
odd
words
of
welcome
were
spoken
in
a
clear
,
ringing
,
pleasant
voice
.
<EOS>
The
offered
hand
 
rather
large
,
but
beautifully
formed
 
was
given
to
me
with
the
easy
,
unaffected
self
-
reliance
of
a
highly
-
bred
woman
.
<EOS>
We
sat
down
together
at
the
breakfast
-
table
in
as
cordial
and
customary
a
manner
as
if
we
had
known
each
other
for
years
,
and
had
met
at
Limmeridge
House
to
talk
over
old
times
by
previous
appointment
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
come
here
<EOS>
good
-
humouredly
determined
to
make
the
best
of
your
position
,
"
continued
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
have
to
begin
this
morning
by
putting
up
with
no
other
company
at
breakfast
than
mine
.
<EOS>
My
sister
is
in
her
own
room
,
nursing
that
essentially
feminine
malady
,
a
slight
headache
;
and
her
old
governess
,
Mrs.
Vesey
,
is
charitably
attending
on
her
with
restorative
tea
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
Mr.
Fairlie
,
never
joins
us
at
any
of
our
meals
:
he
is
an
invalid
,
and
keeps
bachelor
state
in
his
own
apartments
.
<EOS>
There
is
nobody
else
in
the
house
<EOS>
but
me
.
<EOS>
Two
young
ladies
have
been
staying
here
,
but
they
went
away
yesterday
,
in
despair
;
and
no
wonder
.
<EOS>
All
through
their
visit
(
in
consequence
of
Mr.
Fairlie
's
invalid
condition
)
we
produced
no
such
convenience
in
the
house
as
a
flirtable
,
danceable
,
small
-
talkable
creature
of
the
male
sex
;
and
the
consequence
was
,
we
did
nothing
but
quarrel
,
especially
at
dinner
-
time
.
<EOS>
How
can
you
expect
four
women
to
dine
together
alone
every
day
,
and
not
quarrel
?
<EOS>
We
are
such
fools
,
we
ca
n't
entertain
each
other
at
table
.
<EOS>
You
see
I
do
n't
think
much
of
my
own
sex
,
Mr.
Hartright
 
which
will
you
have
,
tea
or
coffee
?
 
<EOS>
no
woman
does
think
much
of
her
own
sex
,
although
few
of
them
confess
it
as
freely
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
Dear
me
,
you
look
puzzled
.
<EOS>
Why
?
<EOS>
Are
you
wondering
what
you
will
have
for
breakfast
?
<EOS>
or
are
you
surprised
at
my
careless
way
of
talking
?
<EOS>
In
the
first
case
,
I
advise
you
,
as
a
friend
,
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
cold
ham
at
your
elbow
,
and
to
wait
till
the
omelette
comes
in
.
<EOS>
In
the
second
case
,
I
will
give
you
some
tea
to
compose
your
spirits
,
and
do
all
a
woman
can
(
which
is
very
little
,
by
-
the
-
bye
)
to
hold
my
tongue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
handed
me
my
cup
of
tea
,
laughing
gaily
.
<EOS>
Her
light
flow
of
talk
,
and
her
lively
familiarity
of
manner
with
a
total
stranger
,
were
accompanied
by
an
unaffected
naturalness
and
an
easy
inborn
confidence
in
herself
and
her
position
,
which
would
have
secured
her
the
respect
of
the
most
audacious
man
breathing
.
<EOS>
While
it
was
impossible
to
be
formal
and
reserved
in
her
company
,
it
was
more
than
impossible
to
take
the
faintest
vestige
of
a
liberty
with
her
,
even
in
thought
.
<EOS>
I
felt
this
instinctively
,
even
while
I
caught
the
infection
of
her
own
bright
gaiety
of
spirits
 
even
while
I
did
my
best
to
answer
her
in
her
own
frank
,
lively
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
she
said
,
when
I
had
suggested
the
only
explanation
I
could
offer
,
to
account
for
my
perplexed
looks
,
"
I
understand
.
<EOS>
You
are
such
a
perfect
stranger
in
the
house
,
that
you
are
puzzled
by
my
familiar
references
to
the
worthy
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
Natural
enough
:
I
ought
to
have
thought
of
it
before
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
I
can
set
it
right
now
.
<EOS>
Suppose
I
begin
with
myself
,
so
as
to
get
done
with
that
part
of
the
subject
as
soon
as
possible
?
<EOS>
My
name
is
Marian
Halcombe
;
and
I
am
as
inaccurate
as
women
usually
are
,
in
calling
Mr.
Fairlie
my
uncle
,
and
Miss
Fairlie
my
sister
.
<EOS>
My
mother
was
twice
married
:
the
first
time
to
Mr.
Halcombe
,
my
father
;
the
second
time
to
Mr.
Fairlie
,
my
half
-
sister
's
father
.
<EOS>
Except
that
we
are
both
orphans
,
we
are
in
every
respect
as
unlike
each
other
as
possible
.
<EOS>
My
father
was
a
poor
man
,
and
Miss
Fairlie
's
father
was
a
rich
man
.
<EOS>
I
have
got
nothing
,
and
she
has
a
fortune
.
<EOS>
I
am
dark
and
ugly
,
and
she
is
fair
and
pretty
.
<EOS>
Everybody
thinks
me
crabbed
and
odd
(
with
perfect
justice
)
;
and
everybody
thinks
her
sweet
-
tempered
and
charming
(
with
more
justice
still
)
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
she
is
an
angel
;
and
I
am
Try
some
of
that
marmalade
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
and
finish
the
sentence
,
in
the
name
of
female
propriety
,
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
What
am
I
to
tell
you
about
Mr.
Fairlie
?
<EOS>
Upon
my
honour
,
I
hardly
know
.
<EOS>
He
is
sure
to
send
for
you
after
breakfast
,
and
you
can
study
him
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
I
may
inform
you
,
first
,
that
he
is
the
late
Mr.
Fairlie
's
younger
brother
;
secondly
,
that
he
is
a
single
man
;
and
thirdly
,
that
he
is
Miss
Fairlie
's
guardian
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
live
without
her
,
and
she
ca
n't
live
without
me
;
and
that
is
how
I
come
to
be
at
Limmeridge
House
.
<EOS>
My
sister
and
I
are
honestly
fond
of
each
other
;
which
,
you
will
say
,
is
perfectly
unaccountable
,
under
the
circumstances
,
and
I
quite
agree
with
you
 
<EOS>
but
so
it
is
.
<EOS>
You
must
please
both
of
us
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
or
please
neither
of
us
:
<EOS>
and
,
what
is
still
more
trying
,
you
will
be
thrown
entirely
upon
our
society
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vesey
is
an
excellent
person
,
who
possesses
all
the
cardinal
virtues
,
and
counts
for
nothing
;
and
Mr.
Fairlie
is
too
great
an
invalid
to
be
a
companion
for
anybody
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
is
the
matter
with
him
,
and
the
doctors
do
n't
know
what
is
the
matter
with
him
,
and
he
does
n't
know
himself
what
is
the
matter
with
him
.
<EOS>
We
all
say
it
's
on
the
nerves
,
and
we
none
of
us
know
what
we
mean
when
we
say
it
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
advise
you
to
humour
his
little
peculiarities
,
when
you
see
him
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Admire
his
collection
of
coins
,
prints
,
and
water
-
colour
drawings
,
and
you
will
win
his
heart
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
if
you
can
be
contented
with
a
quiet
country
life
,
I
do
n't
see
why
you
should
not
get
on
very
well
here
.
<EOS>
From
breakfast
to
lunch
,
Mr.
Fairlie
's
drawings
will
occupy
you
.
<EOS>
After
lunch
,
Miss
Fairlie
and
I
shoulder
our
sketch
-
books
,
and
go
out
to
misrepresent
Nature
,
under
your
directions
.
<EOS>
Drawing
is
her
favourite
whim
,
mind
,
not
mine
.
<EOS>
Women
ca
n't
draw
 
their
minds
are
too
flighty
,
and
their
eyes
are
too
inattentive
.
<EOS>
No
matter
 
my
sister
likes
it
;
so
I
waste
paint
and
spoil
paper
,
for
her
sake
,
as
composedly
as
any
woman
in
England
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
evenings
,
I
think
we
can
help
you
through
them
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
plays
delightfully
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
poor
part
,
I
do
n't
know
one
note
of
music
from
the
other
;
but
I
can
match
you
at
chess
,
backgammon
,
ecarte
,
and
<EOS>
(
with
the
inevitable
female
drawbacks
)
even
at
billiards
as
well
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
the
programme
?
<EOS>
Can
you
reconcile
yourself
to
our
quiet
,
regular
life
?
<EOS>
or
do
you
mean
to
be
restless
,
and
secretly
thirst
for
change
and
adventure
,
in
the
humdrum
atmosphere
of
Limmeridge
House
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
run
on
thus
far
,
in
her
gracefully
bantering
way
,
with
no
other
interruptions
on
my
part
than
the
unimportant
replies
which
politeness
required
of
me
.
<EOS>
The
turn
of
the
expression
,
however
,
in
her
last
question
,
or
rather
the
one
chance
word
,
"
adventure
,
"
lightly
as
it
fell
from
her
lips
,
recalled
my
thoughts
to
my
meeting
with
the
woman
in
white
,
and
urged
me
to
discover
the
connection
which
the
stranger
's
own
reference
to
Mrs.
Fairlie
informed
me
must
once
have
existed
between
the
nameless
fugitive
from
the
Asylum
,
and
the
former
mistress
of
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
"
Even
if
I
were
the
most
restless
of
mankind
,
"
I
said
,
"
I
should
be
in
no
danger
of
thirsting
after
adventures
for
some
time
to
come
.
<EOS>
The
very
night
before
I
arrived
at
this
house
,
I
met
with
an
adventure
;
and
the
wonder
and
excitement
of
it
<EOS>
,
I
can
assure
you
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
will
last
me
for
the
whole
term
of
my
stay
in
Cumberland
,
if
not
for
a
much
longer
period
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
say
so
,
Mr.
Hartright
!
<EOS>
May
I
hear
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
claim
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
The
chief
person
in
the
adventure
was
a
total
stranger
to
me
,
and
may
perhaps
be
a
total
stranger
to
you
;
but
she
certainly
mentioned
the
name
of
the
late
Mrs.
Fairlie
in
terms
of
the
sincerest
gratitude
and
regard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mentioned
my
mother
's
name
!
<EOS>
You
interest
me
indescribably
.
<EOS>
Pray
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
at
once
related
the
circumstances
under
which
I
had
met
the
woman
in
white
,
exactly
as
they
had
occurred
;
and
I
repeated
what
she
had
said
to
me
about
Mrs.
Fairlie
and
Limmeridge
House
,
word
for
word
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
's
bright
resolute
eyes
looked
eagerly
into
mine
,
from
the
beginning
of
the
narrative
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
Her
face
expressed
vivid
interest
and
astonishment
,
but
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
She
was
evidently
as
far
from
knowing
of
any
clue
to
the
mystery
as
I
was
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
quite
sure
of
those
words
referring
to
my
mother
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
sure
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Whoever
she
may
be
,
the
woman
was
once
at
school
in
the
village
of
Limmeridge
,
was
treated
with
especial
kindness
by
Mrs.
Fairlie
,
and
,
in
grateful
remembrance
of
that
kindness
,
feels
an
affectionate
interest
in
all
surviving
members
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
Mrs.
Fairlie
and
her
husband
were
both
dead
;
and
she
spoke
of
Miss
Fairlie
as
if
they
had
known
each
other
when
they
were
children
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
said
,
I
think
,
that
she
denied
belonging
to
this
place
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
she
told
me
she
came
from
Hampshire
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
entirely
failed
to
find
out
her
name
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Entirely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
strange
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
were
quite
justified
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
in
giving
the
poor
creature
her
liberty
,
for
she
seems
to
have
done
nothing
in
your
presence
to
show
herself
unfit
to
enjoy
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
wish
you
had
been
a
little
more
resolute
about
finding
out
her
name
.
<EOS>
We
must
really
clear
up
this
mystery
,
in
some
way
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
not
speak
of
it
yet
to
Mr.
Fairlie
,
or
to
my
sister
.
<EOS>
They
are
both
of
them
,
I
am
certain
,
quite
as
ignorant
of
who
the
woman
is
,
and
of
what
her
past
history
in
connection
with
us
can
be
,
as
I
am
myself
.
<EOS>
But
they
are
also
,
in
widely
different
ways
,
rather
nervous
and
sensitive
;
and
you
would
only
fidget
one
and
alarm
the
other
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
As
for
myself
,
I
am
all
aflame
with
curiosity
,
and
I
devote
my
whole
energies
to
the
business
of
discovery
from
this
moment
.
<EOS>
When
my
mother
came
here
,
after
her
second
marriage
,
she
certainly
established
the
village
school
just
as
it
exists
at
the
present
time
.
<EOS>
But
the
old
teachers
are
all
dead
,
or
gone
elsewhere
;
and
no
enlightenment
is
to
be
hoped
for
from
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
The
only
other
alternative
I
can
think
of
 
"
  
At
this
point
we
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
the
servant
,
with
a
message
from
Mr.
Fairlie
,
intimating
that
he
would
be
glad
to
see
me
,
as
soon
as
I
had
done
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wait
in
the
hall
,
"
said
Miss
Halcombe
,
answering
the
servant
for
me
,
in
her
quick
,
ready
way
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Hartright
will
come
out
directly
.
<EOS>
I
was
about
to
say
,
"
she
went
on
,
addressing
me
again
,
"
that
my
sister
and
I
have
a
large
collection
of
my
mother
's
letters
,
addressed
to
my
father
and
to
hers
.
<EOS>
In
the
absence
of
any
other
means
of
getting
information
,
I
will
pass
the
morning
in
looking
over
my
mother
's
correspondence
with
Mr.
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
He
was
fond
of
London
,
and
was
constantly
away
from
his
country
home
;
and
she
was
accustomed
,
at
such
times
,
to
write
and
report
to
him
how
things
went
on
at
Limmeridge
.
<EOS>
Her
letters
are
full
of
references
to
the
school
in
which
she
took
so
strong
an
interest
;
and
I
think
it
more
than
likely
that
I
may
have
discovered
something
when
we
meet
again
.
<EOS>
The
luncheon
hour
is
two
,
Mr.
Hartright
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
you
to
my
sister
by
that
time
,
and
we
will
occupy
the
afternoon
in
driving
round
the
neighbourhood
and
showing
you
all
our
pet
points
of
view
.
<EOS>
Till
two
o'clock
,
then
,
farewell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
nodded
to
me
with
the
lively
grace
,
the
delightful
refinement
of
familiarity
,
which
characterised
all
that
she
did
and
all
that
she
said
;
and
disappeared
by
a
door
at
the
lower
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
had
left
me
,
I
turned
my
steps
towards
the
hall
,
and
followed
the
servant
,
on
my
way
,
for
the
first
time
,
to
the
presence
of
Mr.
Fairlie
.
    
<EOS>
My
conductor
led
me
upstairs
into
a
passage
which
took
us
back
to
the
bedchamber
in
which
I
had
slept
during
the
past
night
;
and
opening
the
door
next
to
it
,
begged
me
to
look
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
my
master
's
orders
to
show
you
your
own
sitting
-
room
,
sir
,
"
said
the
man
,
"
and
to
inquire
if
you
approve
of
the
situation
and
the
light
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
must
have
been
hard
to
please
,
indeed
,
if
I
had
not
approved
of
the
room
,
and
of
everything
about
it
.
<EOS>
The
bow
-
window
looked
out
on
the
same
lovely
view
which
I
had
admired
,
in
the
morning
,
from
my
bedroom
.
<EOS>
The
furniture
was
the
perfection
of
luxury
and
beauty
;
the
table
in
the
centre
was
bright
with
gaily
bound
books
,
elegant
conveniences
for
writing
,
and
beautiful
flowers
;
the
second
table
,
near
the
window
,
was
covered
with
all
the
necessary
materials
for
mounting
water
-
colour
drawings
,
and
had
a
little
easel
attached
to
it
,
which
I
could
expand
or
fold
up
at
will
;
the
walls
were
hung
with
gaily
tinted
chintz
;
and
the
floor
was
spread
with
Indian
matting
in
maize
-
colour
and
red
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
prettiest
and
most
luxurious
little
sitting
-
room
<EOS>
I
had
ever
seen
;
and
I
admired
it
with
the
warmest
enthusiasm
.
  
<EOS>
The
solemn
servant
was
far
too
highly
trained
to
betray
the
slightest
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
He
bowed
with
icy
deference
when
my
terms
of
eulogy
were
all
exhausted
,
and
silently
opened
the
door
for
me
to
go
out
into
the
passage
again
.
  
<EOS>
We
turned
a
corner
,
and
entered
a
long
second
passage
,
ascended
a
short
flight
of
stairs
at
the
end
,
crossed
a
small
circular
upper
hall
,
and
stopped
in
front
of
a
door
covered
with
dark
baize
.
<EOS>
The
servant
opened
this
door
,
and
led
me
on
a
few
yards
to
a
second
;
opened
that
also
,
and
disclosed
two
curtains
of
pale
sea
-
green
silk
hanging
before
us
;
raised
one
of
them
noiselessly
;
softly
uttered
the
words
,
"
Mr.
Hartright
,
"
and
left
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
myself
in
a
large
,
lofty
room
,
with
a
magnificent
carved
ceiling
,
and
with
a
carpet
over
the
floor
,
so
thick
and
soft
that
it
felt
like
piles
of
velvet
under
my
feet
.
<EOS>
One
side
of
the
room
was
occupied
by
a
long
book
-
case
of
some
rare
inlaid
wood
that
was
quite
new
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
more
than
six
feet
high
,
and
the
top
was
adorned
with
statuettes
in
marble
,
ranged
at
regular
distances
one
from
the
other
.
<EOS>
On
the
opposite
side
stood
two
antique
cabinets
;
and
between
them
,
and
above
them
,
hung
a
picture
of
the
Virgin
and
Child
,
protected
by
glass
,
and
bearing
Raphael
's
name
on
the
gilt
tablet
at
the
bottom
of
the
frame
.
<EOS>
On
my
right
hand
and
on
my
left
,
as
I
stood
inside
the
door
,
were
chiffoniers
and
little
stands
in
buhl
and
marquetterie
,
loaded
with
figures
in
Dresden
china
,
with
rare
vases
,
ivory
ornaments
,
and
toys
and
curiosities
that
sparkled
at
all
points
with
gold
,
silver
,
and
precious
stones
.
<EOS>
At
the
lower
end
of
the
room
,
opposite
to
me
,
the
windows
were
concealed
and
the
sunlight
was
tempered
by
large
blinds
of
the
same
pale
sea
-
green
colour
as
the
curtains
over
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
light
thus
produced
was
deliciously
soft
,
mysterious
,
and
subdued
;
it
fell
equally
upon
all
the
objects
in
the
room
;
it
helped
to
intensify
the
deep
silence
,
and
the
air
of
profound
seclusion
that
possessed
the
place
;
and
it
surrounded
,
with
an
appropriate
halo
of
repose
,
the
solitary
figure
of
the
master
of
the
house
,
leaning
back
,
listlessly
composed
,
in
a
large
easy
-
chair
,
with
a
reading
-
easel
fastened
on
one
of
its
arms
,
and
a
little
table
on
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
If
a
man
's
personal
appearance
,
when
he
is
out
of
his
dressing
-
room
,
and
when
he
has
passed
forty
,
can
be
accepted
as
a
safe
guide
to
his
time
of
life
 
which
is
more
than
doubtful
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
's
age
,
when
I
saw
him
,
might
have
been
reasonably
computed
at
over
fifty
and
under
sixty
years
.
<EOS>
His
beardless
face
was
thin
,
worn
,
and
transparently
pale
,
but
not
wrinkled
;
his
nose
was
high
and
hooked
;
his
eyes
were
of
a
dim
greyish
blue
,
large
,
prominent
,
and
rather
red
round
the
rims
of
the
eyelids
;
his
hair
was
scanty
,
soft
to
look
at
,
and
of
that
light
sandy
colour
which
is
the
last
to
disclose
its
own
changes
towards
grey
.
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
in
a
dark
frock
-
coat
,
of
some
substance
much
thinner
than
cloth
,
and
in
waistcoat
and
trousers
of
spotless
white
.
<EOS>
His
feet
were
effeminately
small
,
and
were
clad
in
buff
-
coloured
silk
stockings
,
and
little
womanish
bronze
-
leather
slippers
.
<EOS>
Two
rings
adorned
his
white
delicate
hands
,
the
value
of
which
even
my
inexperienced
observation
detected
to
be
all
but
priceless
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
,
he
had
a
frail
,
languidly
-
fretful
,
<EOS>
over
-
refined
look
 
something
singularly
and
unpleasantly
delicate
in
its
association
with
a
man
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
something
which
could
by
no
possibility
have
looked
natural
and
appropriate
if
it
had
been
transferred
to
the
personal
appearance
of
a
woman
.
<EOS>
My
morning
's
experience
of
Miss
Halcombe
had
predisposed
me
to
be
pleased
with
everybody
in
the
house
;
but
my
sympathies
shut
themselves
up
resolutely
at
the
first
sight
of
Mr.
Fairlie
.
  
<EOS>
On
approaching
nearer
to
him
,
I
discovered
that
he
was
not
so
entirely
without
occupation
as
I
had
at
first
supposed
.
<EOS>
Placed
amid
the
other
rare
and
beautiful
objects
on
a
large
round
table
near
him
,
was
a
dwarf
cabinet
in
ebony
and
silver
,
containing
coins
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
,
set
out
in
little
drawers
lined
with
dark
purple
velvet
.
<EOS>
One
of
these
drawers
lay
on
the
small
table
attached
to
his
chair
;
and
near
it
were
some
tiny
jeweller
's
brushes
,
a
wash
-
leather
"
stump
,
"
and
a
little
bottle
of
liquid
,
all
waiting
to
be
used
in
various
ways
for
the
removal
of
any
accidental
impurities
which
might
be
discovered
on
the
coins
.
<EOS>
His
frail
white
fingers
were
listlessly
toying
with
something
which
looked
,
to
my
uninstructed
eyes
,
like
a
dirty
pewter
medal
with
ragged
edges
,
when
I
advanced
within
a
respectful
distance
of
his
chair
,
and
stopped
to
make
my
bow
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
glad
to
possess
you
at
Limmeridge
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
"
he
said
in
a
querulous
,
croaking
voice
,
which
combined
,
in
anything
but
an
agreeable
manner
,
a
discordantly
high
tone
with
a
drowsily
languid
utterance
.
"
<EOS>
Pray
sit
down
.
<EOS>
And
do
n't
trouble
yourself
to
move
the
chair
,
please
.
<EOS>
In
the
wretched
state
of
my
nerves
,
movement
of
any
kind
is
exquisitely
painful
to
me
.
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
your
studio
?
<EOS>
Will
it
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
come
from
seeing
the
room
,
Mr.
Fairlie
;
and
I
assure
you
 
"
  
<EOS>
He
stopped
me
in
the
middle
of
the
sentence
,
by
closing
his
eyes
,
and
holding
up
one
of
his
white
hands
imploringly
.
<EOS>
I
paused
in
astonishment
;
and
the
croaking
voice
honoured
me
with
this
explanation
    
<EOS>
"
Pray
excuse
me
.
<EOS>
But
could
you
contrive
to
speak
in
a
lower
key
?
<EOS>
In
the
wretched
state
of
my
nerves
,
loud
sound
of
any
kind
is
indescribable
torture
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
will
pardon
an
invalid
?
<EOS>
I
only
say
to
you
what
the
lamentable
state
of
my
health
obliges
me
to
say
to
everybody
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
And
you
really
like
the
room
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
wish
for
nothing
prettier
and
nothing
more
comfortable
,
"
I
answered
,
dropping
my
voice
,
and
beginning
to
discover
already
that
Mr.
Fairlie
's
selfish
affectation
and
Mr.
Fairlie
's
wretched
nerves
meant
one
and
the
same
thing
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
glad
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
your
position
here
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
properly
recognised
.
<EOS>
There
is
none
of
the
horrid
English
barbarity
of
feeling
about
the
social
position
of
an
artist
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
So
much
of
my
early
life
has
been
passed
abroad
,
that
I
have
quite
cast
my
insular
skin
in
that
respect
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
say
the
same
of
the
gentry
 
detestable
word
,
but
I
suppose
I
must
use
it
 
of
the
gentry
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
They
are
sad
Goths
in
Art
,
Mr.
Hartright
.
<EOS>
People
,
I
do
assure
you
,
who
would
have
opened
their
eyes
in
astonishment
,
if
they
had
seen
Charles
the
Fifth
pick
up
Titian
's
brush
for
him
.
<EOS>
Do
you
mind
putting
this
tray
of
coins
back
in
the
cabinet
,
and
giving
me
the
next
one
to
it
?
<EOS>
In
the
wretched
state
of
my
nerves
,
exertion
of
any
kind
is
unspeakably
disagreeable
to
me
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Thank
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
a
practical
commentary
on
the
liberal
social
theory
which
he
had
just
favoured
me
by
illustrating
,
Mr.
Fairlie
's
cool
request
rather
amused
me
.
<EOS>
I
put
back
one
drawer
and
gave
him
the
other
,
with
all
possible
politeness
.
<EOS>
He
began
trifling
with
the
new
set
of
coins
and
the
little
brushes
immediately
;
languidly
looking
at
them
and
admiring
them
all
the
time
he
was
speaking
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
thousand
thanks
and
a
thousand
excuses
.
<EOS>
Do
you
like
coins
?
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
So
glad
we
have
another
taste
in
common
besides
our
taste
for
Art
.
<EOS>
Now
,
about
the
pecuniary
arrangements
between
us
 
do
tell
me
 
are
they
satisfactory
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Most
satisfactory
,
Mr.
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
glad
.
<EOS>
And
 
what
next
?
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
remember
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
In
reference
to
the
consideration
which
you
are
good
enough
to
accept
for
giving
me
the
benefit
of
your
accomplishments
in
art
,
my
steward
will
wait
on
you
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
,
to
ascertain
your
wishes
.
<EOS>
And
 
what
next
?
<EOS>
Curious
,
is
it
not
?
<EOS>
I
had
a
great
deal
more
to
say
:
and
I
appear
to
have
quite
forgotten
it
.
<EOS>
Do
you
mind
touching
the
bell
?
<EOS>
In
that
corner
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Thank
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
rang
;
and
a
new
servant
noiselessly
made
his
appearance
 
a
foreigner
,
with
a
set
smile
and
perfectly
brushed
hair
 
a
valet
every
inch
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Louis
,
"
said
Mr.
Fairlie
,
dreamily
dusting
the
tips
of
his
fingers
with
one
of
the
tiny
brushes
for
the
coins
,
"
I
made
some
entries
in
my
tablettes
this
morning
.
<EOS>
Find
my
tablettes
.
<EOS>
A
thousand
pardons
<EOS>
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
I
'm
afraid
I
bore
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
wearily
closed
his
eyes
again
,
before
I
could
answer
,
and
as
he
did
most
assuredly
bore
me
,
I
sat
silent
,
and
looked
up
at
the
Madonna
and
Child
by
Raphael
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
the
valet
left
the
room
,
and
returned
shortly
with
a
little
ivory
book
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
,
after
first
relieving
himself
by
a
gentle
sigh
,
let
the
book
drop
open
with
one
hand
,
and
held
up
the
tiny
brush
with
the
other
,
as
a
sign
to
the
servant
to
wait
for
further
orders
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Just
so
!
"
said
Mr.
Fairlie
,
consulting
the
tablettes
.
<EOS>
"
Louis
,
take
down
that
portfolio
.
"
<EOS>
He
pointed
,
as
he
spoke
,
to
several
portfolios
placed
near
the
window
,
on
mahogany
stands
.
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Not
the
one
with
the
green
back
 
that
contains
my
Rembrandt
etchings
,
Mr.
Hartright
.
<EOS>
Do
you
like
etchings
?
<EOS>
Yes
?
<EOS>
So
glad
we
have
another
taste
in
common
.
<EOS>
The
portfolio
with
the
red
back
,
Louis
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
drop
it
!
<EOS>
You
have
no
idea
of
the
tortures
I
should
suffer
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
if
Louis
dropped
that
portfolio
.
<EOS>
Is
it
safe
on
the
chair
?
<EOS>
Do
YOU
think
it
safe
<EOS>
,
Mr.
Hartright
?
<EOS>
Yes
?
<EOS>
So
glad
.
<EOS>
Will
you
oblige
me
by
looking
at
the
drawings
,
if
you
really
think
they
are
quite
safe
.
<EOS>
Louis
,
go
away
.
<EOS>
What
an
ass
you
are
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
me
holding
the
tablettes
?
<EOS>
Do
you
suppose
I
want
to
hold
them
?
<EOS>
Then
why
not
relieve
me
of
the
tablettes
without
being
told
?
<EOS>
A
thousand
pardons
,
Mr.
Hartright
;
servants
are
such
asses
,
are
they
not
?
<EOS>
Do
tell
me
 
what
do
you
think
of
the
drawings
?
<EOS>
They
have
come
from
a
sale
in
a
shocking
state
 
<EOS>
I
thought
they
smelt
of
horrid
dealers
'
and
brokers
'
fingers
when
I
looked
at
them
last
.
<EOS>
CAN
you
undertake
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
Although
my
nerves
were
not
delicate
enough
to
detect
the
odour
of
plebeian
fingers
which
had
offended
Mr.
Fairlie
's
nostrils
,
my
taste
was
sufficiently
educated
to
enable
me
to
appreciate
the
value
of
the
drawings
,
while
I
turned
them
over
.
<EOS>
They
were
,
for
the
most
part
,
really
fine
specimens
of
English
water
-
colour
art
;
and
they
had
deserved
much
better
treatment
at
the
hands
of
their
former
possessor
than
they
appeared
to
have
received
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
drawings
,
"
I
answered
,
"
require
careful
straining
and
mounting
;
and
,
in
my
opinion
,
they
are
well
worth
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
interposed
Mr.
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mind
my
closing
my
eyes
while
you
speak
?
<EOS>
Even
this
light
is
too
much
for
them
.
<EOS>
Yes
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
about
to
say
that
the
drawings
are
well
worth
all
the
time
and
trouble
 
<EOS>
"
  
Mr.
Fairlie
suddenly
opened
his
eyes
again
,
and
rolled
them
with
an
expression
of
helpless
alarm
in
the
direction
of
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
entreat
you
to
excuse
me
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
"
he
said
in
a
feeble
flutter
.
<EOS>
"
But
surely
I
hear
some
horrid
children
in
the
garden
 
<EOS>
my
private
garden
 
<EOS>
below
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
,
Mr.
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
I
heard
nothing
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oblige
me
 
<EOS>
you
have
been
so
very
good
in
humouring
my
poor
nerves
 
<EOS>
oblige
me
by
lifting
up
a
corner
of
the
blind
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
the
sun
in
on
me
,
Mr.
Hartright
!
<EOS>
Have
you
got
the
blind
up
?
<EOS>
Yes
?
<EOS>
Then
will
you
be
so
very
kind
as
to
look
into
the
garden
and
make
quite
sure
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
complied
with
this
new
request
.
<EOS>
The
garden
was
carefully
walled
in
,
all
round
.
<EOS>
Not
a
human
creature
,
large
or
small
,
appeared
in
any
part
of
the
sacred
seclusion
.
<EOS>
I
reported
that
gratifying
fact
to
Mr.
Fairlie
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
thousand
thanks
.
<EOS>
My
fancy
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
There
are
no
children
,
thank
Heaven
,
in
the
house
;
but
the
servants
(
persons
born
without
nerves
)
will
encourage
the
children
from
the
village
.
<EOS>
Such
brats
 
<EOS>
oh
,
dear
me
,
such
brats
!
<EOS>
Shall
I
confess
it
,
Mr.
Hartright
?
 
<EOS>
I
sadly
want
a
reform
in
the
construction
of
children
.
<EOS>
Nature
's
only
idea
seems
to
be
to
make
them
machines
for
the
production
of
incessant
noise
.
<EOS>
Surely
our
delightful
Raffaello
's
conception
is
infinitely
preferable
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
pointed
to
the
picture
of
the
Madonna
,
the
upper
part
of
which
represented
the
conventional
cherubs
of
Italian
Art
,
celestially
provided
with
sitting
accommodation
for
their
chins
,
on
balloons
of
buff
-
coloured
cloud
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
a
model
family
!
"
said
Mr.
Fairlie
,
leering
at
the
cherubs
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
nice
round
faces
,
and
such
nice
soft
wings
,
and
 
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
No
dirty
little
legs
to
run
about
on
,
and
no
noisy
little
lungs
to
scream
with
.
<EOS>
How
immeasurably
superior
to
the
existing
construction
!
<EOS>
I
will
close
my
eyes
again
,
if
you
will
allow
me
.
<EOS>
And
you
really
can
manage
the
drawings
?
<EOS>
So
glad
.
<EOS>
Is
there
anything
else
to
settle
?
<EOS>
if
there
is
,
I
think
I
have
forgotten
it
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
ring
for
Louis
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Being
,
by
this
time
,
quite
as
anxious
,
on
my
side
,
as
Mr.
Fairlie
evidently
was
on
his
,
to
bring
the
interview
to
a
speedy
conclusion
<EOS>
,
I
thought
I
would
try
to
render
the
summoning
of
the
servant
unnecessary
,
by
offering
the
requisite
suggestion
on
my
own
responsibility
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
only
point
,
Mr.
Fairlie
,
that
remains
to
be
discussed
,
"
I
said
,
"
refers
,
I
think
,
to
the
instruction
in
sketching
which
I
am
engaged
to
communicate
to
the
two
young
ladies
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
just
so
,
"
said
Mr.
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
felt
strong
enough
to
go
into
that
part
of
the
arrangement
 
<EOS>
but
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
who
profit
by
your
kind
services
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
must
settle
,
and
decide
,
and
so
on
,
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
My
niece
is
fond
of
your
charming
art
.
<EOS>
She
knows
just
enough
about
it
to
be
conscious
of
her
own
sad
defects
.
<EOS>
Please
take
pains
with
her
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Is
there
anything
else
?
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
We
quite
understand
each
other
 
<EOS>
do
n't
we
?
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
to
detain
you
any
longer
from
your
delightful
pursuit
 
<EOS>
have
I
?
<EOS>
So
pleasant
to
have
settled
everything
 
such
a
sensible
relief
to
have
done
business
.
<EOS>
Do
you
mind
ringing
for
Louis
to
carry
the
portfolio
to
your
own
room
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
carry
it
there
myself
,
Mr.
Fairlie
,
if
you
will
allow
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
really
?
<EOS>
Are
you
strong
enough
?
<EOS>
How
nice
to
be
so
strong
!
<EOS>
Are
you
sure
you
wo
n't
drop
it
?
<EOS>
So
glad
to
possess
you
at
Limmeridge
,
Mr.
Hartright
.
<EOS>
I
am
such
a
sufferer
that
I
hardly
dare
hope
to
enjoy
much
of
your
society
.
<EOS>
Would
you
mind
taking
great
pains
not
to
let
the
doors
bang
,
and
not
to
drop
the
portfolio
?
<EOS>
Thank
you
.
<EOS>
Gently
with
the
curtains
,
please
 
the
slightest
noise
from
them
goes
through
me
like
a
knife
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
GOOD
morning
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
the
sea
-
green
curtains
were
closed
,
and
when
the
two
baize
doors
were
shut
behind
me
,
I
stopped
for
a
moment
in
the
little
circular
hall
beyond
,
and
drew
a
long
,
luxurious
breath
of
relief
.
<EOS>
It
was
like
coming
to
the
surface
of
the
water
after
deep
diving
,
to
find
myself
once
more
on
the
outside
of
Mr.
Fairlie
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
was
comfortably
established
for
the
morning
in
my
pretty
little
studio
,
the
first
resolution
at
which
I
arrived
was
to
turn
my
steps
no
more
in
the
direction
of
the
apartments
occupied
by
the
master
of
the
house
,
except
in
the
very
improbable
event
of
his
honouring
me
with
a
special
invitation
to
pay
him
another
visit
.
<EOS>
Having
settled
this
satisfactory
plan
of
future
conduct
in
reference
to
Mr.
Fairlie
,
I
soon
recovered
the
serenity
of
temper
of
which
my
employer
's
haughty
familiarity
and
impudent
politeness
had
,
for
the
moment
,
deprived
me
.
<EOS>
The
remaining
hours
of
the
morning
passed
away
pleasantly
enough
,
in
looking
over
the
drawings
,
arranging
them
in
sets
,
trimming
their
ragged
edges
,
and
accomplishing
the
other
necessary
preparations
in
anticipation
of
the
business
of
mounting
them
.
<EOS>
I
ought
,
perhaps
,
to
have
made
more
progress
than
this
;
but
,
as
the
luncheon
-
time
drew
near
,
I
grew
restless
and
unsettled
,
and
felt
unable
to
fix
my
attention
on
work
,
even
though
that
work
was
only
of
the
humble
manual
kind
.
  
<EOS>
At
two
o'clock
I
descended
again
to
the
breakfast
-
room
,
a
little
anxiously
.
<EOS>
Expectations
of
some
interest
were
connected
with
my
approaching
reappearance
in
that
part
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
My
introduction
to
Miss
Fairlie
was
now
close
at
hand
;
and
,
if
Miss
Halcombe
's
search
through
her
mother
's
letters
had
produced
the
result
which
she
anticipated
,
the
time
had
come
for
clearing
up
the
mystery
of
the
woman
in
white
.
    
<EOS>
When
I
entered
the
room
,
I
found
Miss
Halcombe
and
an
elderly
lady
seated
at
the
luncheon
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
The
elderly
lady
,
when
I
was
presented
to
her
,
proved
to
be
Miss
Fairlie
's
former
governess
,
Mrs.
Vesey
,
who
had
been
briefly
described
to
me
by
my
lively
companion
at
the
breakfast
-
table
,
as
possessed
of
"
all
the
cardinal
virtues
,
and
counting
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
do
little
more
than
offer
my
humble
testimony
to
the
truthfulness
of
Miss
Halcombe
's
sketch
of
the
old
lady
's
character
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vesey
looked
the
personification
of
human
composure
and
female
amiability
.
<EOS>
A
calm
enjoyment
of
a
calm
existence
beamed
in
drowsy
smiles
on
her
plump
,
placid
face
.
<EOS>
Some
of
us
rush
through
life
,
and
some
of
us
saunter
through
life
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vesey
SAT
through
life
.
<EOS>
Sat
in
the
house
,
early
and
late
;
sat
in
the
garden
;
sat
in
unexpected
window
-
seats
in
passages
;
sat
(
on
a
camp
-
stool
)
<EOS>
when
her
friends
tried
to
take
her
out
walking
;
sat
before
she
looked
at
anything
,
before
she
talked
of
anything
,
before
she
answered
<EOS>
Yes
,
or
No
,
to
the
commonest
question
 
always
with
the
same
serene
smile
on
her
lips
,
the
same
vacantly
-
attentive
turn
of
the
head
,
the
same
snugly
-
comfortable
position
of
her
hands
and
arms
,
under
every
possible
change
of
domestic
circumstances
.
<EOS>
A
mild
,
a
compliant
,
an
unutterably
tranquil
and
harmless
old
lady
,
who
never
by
any
chance
suggested
the
idea
that
she
had
been
actually
alive
since
the
hour
of
her
birth
.
<EOS>
Nature
has
so
much
to
do
in
this
world
,
and
is
engaged
in
generating
such
a
vast
variety
of
co
-
existent
productions
,
that
she
must
surely
be
now
and
then
too
flurried
and
confused
to
distinguish
between
the
different
processes
that
she
is
carrying
on
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
Starting
from
this
point
of
view
,
it
will
always
remain
my
private
persuasion
that
Nature
was
absorbed
in
making
cabbages
when
Mrs.
Vesey
was
born
,
and
that
the
good
lady
suffered
the
consequences
of
a
vegetable
preoccupation
in
the
mind
of
the
Mother
of
us
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mrs.
Vesey
,
"
said
Miss
Halcombe
,
looking
brighter
,
sharper
,
and
readier
than
ever
,
by
contrast
with
the
undemonstrative
old
lady
at
her
side
,
"
what
will
you
have
?
<EOS>
A
cutlet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vesey
crossed
her
dimpled
hands
on
the
edge
of
the
table
,
smiled
placidly
,
and
said
,
"
Yes
,
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
opposite
Mr.
Hartright
?
<EOS>
Boiled
chicken
,
is
it
not
?
<EOS>
I
thought
you
liked
boiled
chicken
better
than
cutlet
,
Mrs.
Vesey
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vesey
took
her
dimpled
hands
off
the
edge
of
the
table
and
crossed
them
on
her
lap
instead
;
nodded
contemplatively
at
the
boiled
chicken
,
and
said
,
"
Yes
,
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
which
will
you
have
,
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
Shall
Mr.
Hartright
give
you
some
chicken
?
<EOS>
or
shall
I
give
you
some
cutlet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vesey
put
one
of
her
dimpled
hands
back
again
on
the
edge
of
the
table
;
hesitated
drowsily
,
and
said
,
"
Which
you
please
,
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mercy
on
me
!
<EOS>
it
's
a
question
for
your
taste
,
my
good
lady
,
not
for
mine
.
<EOS>
Suppose
you
have
a
little
of
both
?
<EOS>
and
suppose
you
begin
with
the
chicken
,
because
Mr.
Hartright
looks
devoured
by
anxiety
to
carve
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vesey
put
the
other
dimpled
hand
back
on
the
edge
of
the
table
;
brightened
dimly
one
moment
;
went
out
again
the
next
;
bowed
obediently
,
and
said
,
"
If
you
please
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
Surely
a
mild
,
a
compliant
,
an
unutterably
tranquil
and
harmless
old
lady
!
<EOS>
But
enough
,
perhaps
,
for
the
present
,
of
Mrs.
Vesey
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
there
were
no
signs
of
Miss
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
We
finished
our
luncheon
;
and
still
she
never
appeared
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
,
whose
quick
eye
nothing
escaped
,
noticed
the
looks
that
I
cast
,
from
time
to
time
,
in
the
direction
of
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
you
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
"
she
said
;
"
you
are
wondering
what
has
become
of
your
other
pupil
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
downstairs
,
and
has
got
over
her
headache
;
but
has
not
sufficiently
recovered
her
appetite
to
join
us
at
lunch
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
put
yourself
under
my
charge
,
I
think
I
can
undertake
to
find
her
somewhere
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
took
up
a
parasol
lying
on
a
chair
near
her
,
and
led
the
way
out
,
by
a
long
window
at
the
bottom
of
the
room
,
which
opened
on
to
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
It
is
almost
unnecessary
to
say
that
we
left
Mrs.
Vesey
still
seated
at
the
table
,
with
her
dimpled
hands
still
crossed
on
the
edge
of
it
;
apparently
settled
in
that
position
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
As
we
crossed
the
lawn
,
Miss
Halcombe
looked
at
me
significantly
,
and
shook
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
mysterious
adventure
of
yours
,
"
she
said
,
"
still
remains
involved
in
its
own
appropriate
midnight
darkness
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
all
the
morning
looking
over
my
mother
's
letters
,
and
I
have
made
no
discoveries
yet
.
<EOS>
However
,
do
n't
despair
,
Mr.
Hartright
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
matter
of
curiosity
;
and
you
have
got
a
woman
for
your
ally
.
<EOS>
Under
such
conditions
success
is
certain
,
sooner
or
later
.
<EOS>
The
letters
are
not
exhausted
.
<EOS>
I
have
three
packets
still
left
,
and
you
may
confidently
rely
on
my
spending
the
whole
evening
over
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
,
then
,
was
one
of
my
anticipations
of
the
morning
still
unfulfilled
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
wonder
,
next
,
whether
my
introduction
to
Miss
Fairlie
would
disappoint
the
expectations
that
I
had
been
forming
of
her
since
breakfast
-
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
did
you
get
on
with
Mr.
Fairlie
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Miss
Halcombe
,
as
we
left
the
lawn
and
turned
into
a
shrubbery
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Was
he
particularly
nervous
this
morning
?
<EOS>
Never
mind
considering
about
your
answer
,
Mr.
Hartright
.
<EOS>
The
mere
fact
of
your
being
obliged
to
consider
is
enough
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
see
in
your
face
that
he
WAS
particularly
nervous
;
and
,
as
I
am
amiably
unwilling
to
throw
you
into
the
same
condition
,
I
ask
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
turned
off
into
a
winding
path
while
she
was
speaking
,
and
approached
a
pretty
summer
-
house
,
built
of
wood
,
in
the
form
of
a
miniature
Swiss
chalet
.
<EOS>
The
one
room
of
the
summer
-
house
,
as
we
ascended
the
steps
of
the
door
,
was
occupied
by
a
young
lady
.
<EOS>
She
was
standing
near
a
rustic
table
,
looking
out
at
the
inland
view
of
moor
and
hill
presented
by
a
gap
in
the
trees
,
and
absently
turning
over
the
leaves
of
a
little
sketch
-
book
that
lay
at
her
side
.
<EOS>
This
was
Miss
Fairlie
.
  
<EOS>
How
can
I
describe
her
?
<EOS>
How
can
I
separate
her
from
my
own
sensations
,
and
from
all
that
has
happened
in
the
later
time
?
<EOS>
How
can
I
see
her
again
as
she
looked
when
my
eyes
first
rested
on
her
 
as
she
should
look
,
now
,
to
the
eyes
that
are
about
to
see
her
in
these
pages
?
  
<EOS>
The
water
-
colour
drawing
that
I
made
of
Laura
Fairlie
,
at
an
after
period
,
in
the
place
and
attitude
in
which
I
first
saw
her
,
lies
on
my
desk
while
I
write
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
it
,
and
there
dawns
upon
me
brightly
,
from
the
dark
greenish
-
brown
background
of
the
summer
-
house
,
a
light
,
youthful
figure
,
clothed
in
a
simple
muslin
dress
,
the
pattern
of
it
formed
by
broad
alternate
stripes
of
delicate
blue
and
white
.
<EOS>
A
scarf
of
the
same
material
sits
crisply
and
closely
round
her
shoulders
,
and
a
little
straw
hat
of
the
natural
colour
,
plainly
and
sparingly
trimmed
with
ribbon
to
match
the
gown
,
covers
her
head
,
and
throws
its
soft
pearly
shadow
over
the
upper
part
of
her
face
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
is
of
so
faint
and
pale
a
brown
 
not
flaxen
,
and
yet
almost
as
light
;
not
golden
,
and
yet
almost
as
glossy
 
that
it
nearly
melts
,
here
and
there
,
into
the
shadow
of
the
hat
.
<EOS>
It
is
plainly
parted
and
drawn
back
over
her
ears
,
and
the
line
of
it
ripples
naturally
as
it
crosses
her
forehead
.
<EOS>
The
eyebrows
are
rather
darker
than
the
hair
;
and
the
eyes
are
of
that
soft
,
limpid
,
turquoise
blue
,
so
often
sung
by
the
poets
,
so
seldom
seen
in
real
life
.
<EOS>
Lovely
eyes
in
colour
,
<EOS>
lovely
eyes
in
form
 
large
and
tender
and
quietly
thoughtful
 
but
beautiful
above
all
things
in
the
clear
truthfulness
of
look
that
dwells
in
their
inmost
depths
,
and
shines
through
all
their
changes
of
expression
with
the
light
of
a
purer
and
a
better
world
.
<EOS>
The
charm
 
most
gently
and
yet
most
distinctly
expressed
 
which
they
shed
over
the
whole
face
,
so
covers
and
transforms
its
little
natural
human
blemishes
elsewhere
,
that
it
is
difficult
to
estimate
the
relative
merits
and
defects
of
the
other
features
.
<EOS>
It
is
hard
to
see
that
the
lower
part
of
the
face
is
too
delicately
refined
away
towards
the
chin
to
be
in
full
and
fair
proportion
with
the
upper
part
;
that
the
nose
,
in
escaping
the
aquiline
bend
(
always
hard
and
cruel
in
a
woman
,
no
matter
how
abstractedly
perfect
it
may
be
)
,
has
erred
a
little
in
the
other
extreme
,
and
has
missed
the
ideal
straightness
of
line
;
and
that
the
sweet
,
sensitive
lips
are
subject
to
a
slight
nervous
contraction
,
when
she
smiles
,
which
draws
them
upward
a
little
at
one
corner
,
towards
the
cheek
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
possible
to
note
these
blemishes
in
another
woman
's
face
<EOS>
but
it
is
not
easy
to
dwell
on
them
in
hers
,
so
subtly
are
they
connected
with
all
that
is
individual
and
characteristic
in
her
expression
,
and
so
closely
does
the
expression
depend
for
its
full
play
and
life
,
in
every
other
feature
,
on
the
moving
impulse
of
the
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
Does
my
poor
portrait
of
her
,
my
fond
,
patient
labour
of
long
and
happy
days
,
show
me
these
things
?
<EOS>
Ah
,
how
few
of
them
are
in
the
dim
mechanical
drawing
,
and
how
many
in
the
mind
with
which
I
regard
it
!
<EOS>
A
fair
,
delicate
girl
,
in
a
pretty
light
dress
,
trifling
with
the
leaves
of
a
sketch
-
book
,
while
she
looks
up
from
it
with
truthful
,
innocent
blue
eyes
 
that
is
all
the
drawing
can
say
;
all
,
perhaps
,
that
even
the
deeper
reach
of
thought
and
pen
can
say
in
their
language
,
either
.
<EOS>
The
woman
who
first
gives
life
,
light
,
and
form
to
our
shadowy
conceptions
of
beauty
,
fills
a
void
in
our
spiritual
nature
that
has
remained
unknown
to
us
till
she
appeared
.
<EOS>
Sympathies
that
lie
too
deep
for
words
,
too
deep
almost
for
thoughts
,
are
touched
,
at
such
times
,
by
other
charms
than
those
which
the
senses
feel
and
which
the
resources
of
expression
can
realise
.
<EOS>
The
mystery
which
underlies
the
beauty
of
women
is
never
raised
above
the
reach
of
all
expression
until
it
has
claimed
kindred
with
the
deeper
mystery
in
our
own
souls
.
<EOS>
Then
,
and
then
only
,
has
it
passed
beyond
the
narrow
region
on
which
light
falls
,
in
this
world
,
from
the
pencil
and
the
pen
.
  
<EOS>
Think
of
her
as
you
thought
of
the
first
woman
who
quickened
the
pulses
within
you
that
the
rest
of
her
sex
had
no
art
to
stir
.
<EOS>
Let
the
kind
,
candid
blue
eyes
meet
yours
,
as
they
met
mine
,
with
the
one
matchless
look
which
we
both
remember
so
well
.
<EOS>
Let
her
voice
speak
the
music
that
you
once
loved
best
,
attuned
as
sweetly
to
your
ear
as
to
mine
.
<EOS>
Let
her
footstep
,
as
she
comes
and
goes
,
in
these
pages
,
be
like
that
other
footstep
to
whose
airy
fall
your
own
heart
once
beat
time
.
<EOS>
Take
her
as
the
visionary
nursling
of
your
own
fancy
;
and
she
will
grow
upon
you
,
all
the
more
clearly
,
as
the
living
woman
who
dwells
in
mine
.
  
<EOS>
Among
the
sensations
that
crowded
on
me
,
when
my
eyes
first
looked
upon
her
 
familiar
sensations
which
we
all
know
,
which
spring
to
life
in
most
of
our
hearts
,
die
again
in
so
many
,
and
renew
their
bright
existence
in
so
few
 
there
was
one
that
troubled
and
perplexed
me
:
one
that
seemed
strangely
inconsistent
and
unaccountably
out
of
place
in
Miss
Fairlie
's
presence
.
  
<EOS>
Mingling
with
the
vivid
impression
produced
by
the
charm
of
her
fair
face
and
head
,
her
sweet
expression
,
and
her
winning
simplicity
of
manner
,
was
another
impression
,
which
,
in
a
shadowy
way
,
suggested
to
me
the
idea
of
something
wanting
.
<EOS>
At
one
time
it
seemed
like
something
wanting
in
HER
:
at
another
,
like
something
wanting
in
myself
,
which
hindered
me
from
understanding
her
as
I
ought
.
<EOS>
The
impression
was
always
strongest
in
the
most
contradictory
manner
,
when
she
looked
at
me
;
or
,
in
other
words
,
when
I
was
most
conscious
of
the
harmony
and
charm
of
her
face
,
and
yet
,
at
the
same
time
,
most
troubled
by
the
sense
of
an
incompleteness
which
it
was
impossible
to
discover
.
<EOS>
Something
wanting
,
something
wanting
 
and
where
it
was
,
and
what
it
was
,
I
could
not
say
.
  
<EOS>
The
effect
of
this
curious
caprice
of
fancy
(
as
I
thought
it
then
)
was
not
of
a
nature
to
set
me
at
my
ease
,
during
a
first
interview
with
Miss
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
The
few
kind
words
of
welcome
which
she
spoke
found
me
hardly
self
-
possessed
enough
to
thank
her
in
the
customary
phrases
of
reply
.
<EOS>
Observing
my
hesitation
,
and
no
doubt
attributing
it
,
naturally
enough
,
to
some
momentary
shyness
on
my
part
,
Miss
Halcombe
took
the
business
of
talking
,
as
easily
and
readily
as
usual
,
into
her
own
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
there
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
"
she
said
,
pointing
to
the
sketch
-
book
on
the
table
,
and
to
the
little
delicate
wandering
hand
that
was
still
trifling
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Surely
you
will
acknowledge
that
your
model
pupil
is
found
at
last
?
<EOS>
The
moment
she
hears
that
you
are
in
the
house
,
she
seizes
her
inestimable
sketch
-
book
,
looks
universal
Nature
straight
in
the
face
,
and
longs
to
begin
!
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
laughed
with
a
ready
good
-
humour
,
which
broke
out
as
brightly
as
if
it
had
been
part
of
the
sunshine
above
us
,
over
her
lovely
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
not
take
credit
to
myself
where
no
credit
is
due
,
"
she
said
,
her
clear
,
truthful
blue
eyes
looking
alternately
at
Miss
Halcombe
and
at
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fond
as
I
am
of
drawing
,
I
am
so
conscious
of
my
own
ignorance
that
I
am
more
afraid
than
anxious
to
begin
.
<EOS>
Now
I
know
you
are
here
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
I
find
myself
looking
over
my
sketches
,
as
I
used
to
look
over
my
lessons
when
I
was
a
little
girl
,
and
when
I
was
sadly
afraid
that
I
should
turn
out
not
fit
to
be
heard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
made
the
confession
very
prettily
and
simply
,
and
,
with
quaint
,
childish
earnestness
,
drew
the
sketch
-
book
away
close
to
her
own
side
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
cut
the
knot
of
the
little
embarrassment
forthwith
,
in
her
resolute
,
downright
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
,
bad
,
or
indifferent
,
"
she
said
,
"
the
pupil
's
sketches
must
pass
through
the
fiery
ordeal
of
the
master
's
judgment
 
and
there
's
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
Suppose
we
take
them
with
us
in
the
carriage
,
Laura
,
and
let
Mr.
Hartright
see
them
,
for
the
first
time
,
under
circumstances
of
perpetual
jolting
and
interruption
?
<EOS>
If
we
can
only
confuse
him
all
through
the
drive
,
between
Nature
as
it
is
,
when
he
looks
up
at
the
view
,
and
Nature
as
it
is
not
when
he
looks
down
again
at
our
sketch
-
books
,
we
shall
drive
him
into
the
last
desperate
refuge
of
paying
us
compliments
,
and
shall
slip
through
his
professional
fingers
with
our
pet
feathers
of
vanity
all
unruffled
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
Mr.
Hartright
will
pay
ME
no
compliments
,
"
said
Miss
Fairlie
,
as
we
all
left
the
summer
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
venture
to
inquire
why
you
express
that
hope
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
shall
believe
all
that
you
say
to
me
,
"
she
answered
simply
.
  
<EOS>
In
those
few
words
she
unconsciously
gave
me
the
key
to
her
whole
character
:
to
that
generous
trust
in
others
which
,
in
her
nature
,
grew
innocently
out
of
the
sense
of
her
own
truth
.
<EOS>
I
only
knew
it
intuitively
then
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
by
experience
now
.
  
<EOS>
We
merely
waited
to
rouse
good
Mrs.
Vesey
from
the
place
which
she
still
occupied
at
the
deserted
luncheon
-
table
,
before
we
entered
the
open
carriage
for
our
promised
drive
.
<EOS>
The
old
lady
and
Miss
Halcombe
occupied
the
back
seat
,
and
Miss
Fairlie
and
<EOS>
I
sat
together
in
front
,
with
the
sketch
-
book
open
between
us
,
fairly
exhibited
at
last
to
my
professional
eyes
.
<EOS>
All
serious
criticism
on
the
drawings
,
even
if
I
had
been
disposed
to
volunteer
it
,
was
rendered
impossible
by
Miss
Halcombe
's
lively
resolution
to
see
nothing
but
the
ridiculous
side
of
the
Fine
Arts
,
as
practised
by
herself
,
her
sister
,
and
ladies
in
general
.
<EOS>
I
can
remember
the
conversation
that
passed
far
more
easily
than
the
sketches
that
I
mechanically
looked
over
.
<EOS>
That
part
of
the
talk
,
especially
,
in
which
Miss
Fairlie
took
any
share
,
is
still
as
vividly
impressed
on
my
memory
as
if
I
had
heard
it
only
a
few
hours
ago
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
!
let
me
acknowledge
that
on
this
first
day
I
let
the
charm
of
her
presence
lure
me
from
the
recollection
of
myself
and
my
position
.
<EOS>
The
most
trifling
of
the
questions
that
she
put
to
me
,
on
the
subject
of
using
her
pencil
and
mixing
her
colours
;
the
slightest
alterations
of
expression
in
the
lovely
eyes
that
looked
into
mine
with
such
an
earnest
desire
to
learn
all
that
I
could
teach
,
and
to
discover
all
that
I
could
show
,
attracted
more
of
my
attention
than
the
finest
view
we
passed
through
,
or
the
grandest
changes
of
light
and
shade
,
as
they
flowed
into
each
other
over
the
waving
moorland
and
the
level
beach
.
<EOS>
At
any
time
,
and
under
any
circumstances
of
human
interest
,
is
it
not
strange
to
see
how
little
real
hold
the
objects
of
the
natural
world
amid
which
we
live
can
gain
on
our
hearts
and
minds
?
<EOS>
We
go
to
Nature
for
comfort
in
trouble
,
and
sympathy
in
joy
,
only
in
books
.
<EOS>
Admiration
of
those
beauties
of
the
inanimate
world
,
which
modern
poetry
so
largely
and
so
eloquently
describes
,
is
not
,
even
in
the
best
of
us
,
one
of
the
original
instincts
of
our
nature
.
<EOS>
As
children
,
we
none
of
us
possess
it
.
<EOS>
No
uninstructed
man
or
woman
possesses
it
.
<EOS>
Those
whose
lives
are
most
exclusively
passed
amid
the
ever
-
changing
wonders
of
sea
and
land
are
also
those
who
are
most
universally
insensible
to
every
aspect
of
Nature
not
directly
associated
with
the
human
interest
of
their
calling
.
<EOS>
Our
capacity
of
appreciating
the
beauties
of
the
earth
we
live
on
is
,
in
truth
,
one
of
the
civilised
accomplishments
which
we
all
learn
as
an
Art
;
and
,
more
,
that
very
capacity
is
rarely
practised
by
any
of
us
except
when
our
minds
are
most
indolent
and
most
unoccupied
.
<EOS>
How
much
share
have
the
attractions
of
Nature
ever
had
in
the
pleasurable
or
painful
interests
and
emotions
of
ourselves
or
our
friends
?
<EOS>
What
space
do
they
ever
occupy
in
the
thousand
little
narratives
of
personal
experience
which
pass
every
day
by
word
of
mouth
from
one
of
us
to
the
other
?
<EOS>
All
that
our
minds
can
compass
,
all
that
our
hearts
can
learn
,
can
be
accomplished
with
equal
certainty
,
equal
profit
,
and
equal
satisfaction
to
ourselves
,
in
the
poorest
as
in
the
richest
prospect
that
the
face
of
the
earth
can
show
.
<EOS>
There
is
surely
a
reason
for
this
want
of
inborn
sympathy
between
the
creature
and
the
creation
around
it
,
a
reason
which
may
perhaps
be
found
in
the
widely
-
differing
destinies
of
man
and
his
earthly
sphere
.
<EOS>
The
grandest
mountain
prospect
that
the
eye
can
range
over
is
appointed
to
annihilation
.
<EOS>
The
smallest
human
interest
that
the
pure
heart
can
feel
is
appointed
to
immortality
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
been
out
nearly
three
hours
,
when
the
carriage
again
passed
through
the
gates
of
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
On
our
way
back
I
had
let
the
ladies
settle
for
themselves
the
first
point
of
view
which
they
were
to
sketch
,
under
my
instructions
,
on
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
When
they
withdrew
to
dress
for
dinner
,
and
when
I
was
alone
again
in
my
little
sitting
-
room
,
my
spirits
seemed
to
leave
me
on
a
sudden
.
<EOS>
I
felt
ill
at
ease
and
dissatisfied
with
myself
,
I
hardly
knew
why
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
was
now
conscious
for
the
first
time
of
having
enjoyed
our
drive
too
much
in
the
character
of
a
guest
,
and
too
little
in
the
character
of
a
drawing
-
master
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
that
strange
sense
of
something
wanting
,
either
in
Miss
Fairlie
or
in
myself
,
which
had
perplexed
me
when
I
was
first
introduced
to
her
,
haunted
me
still
.
<EOS>
Anyhow
,
it
was
a
relief
to
my
spirits
when
the
dinner
-
hour
called
me
out
of
my
solitude
,
and
took
me
back
to
the
society
of
the
ladies
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
struck
,
on
entering
the
drawing
-
room
,
by
the
curious
contrast
,
rather
in
material
than
in
colour
,
of
the
dresses
which
they
now
wore
.
<EOS>
While
Mrs.
Vesey
and
Miss
Halcombe
were
richly
clad
(
each
in
the
manner
most
becoming
to
her
age
)
,
the
first
in
silver
-
grey
,
and
the
second
in
that
delicate
primrose
-
yellow
colour
which
matches
so
well
with
a
dark
complexion
and
black
hair
,
Miss
Fairlie
was
unpretendingly
and
almost
poorly
dressed
in
plain
white
muslin
.
<EOS>
It
was
spotlessly
pure
:
it
was
beautifully
put
on
;
but
still
it
was
the
sort
of
dress
which
the
wife
or
daughter
of
a
poor
man
might
have
worn
,
and
it
made
her
,
so
far
as
externals
went
,
look
less
affluent
in
circumstances
than
her
own
governess
.
<EOS>
At
a
later
period
,
when
I
learnt
to
know
more
of
Miss
Fairlie
's
character
,
I
discovered
that
this
curious
contrast
,
on
the
wrong
side
,
was
due
to
her
natural
delicacy
of
feeling
and
natural
intensity
of
aversion
to
the
slightest
personal
display
of
her
own
wealth
.
<EOS>
Neither
Mrs.
Vesey
nor
Miss
Halcombe
could
ever
induce
her
to
let
the
advantage
in
<EOS>
dress
desert
the
two
ladies
who
were
poor
,
to
lean
to
the
side
of
the
one
lady
who
was
rich
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
dinner
was
over
we
returned
together
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Although
Mr.
Fairlie
(
emulating
the
magnificent
condescension
of
the
monarch
who
had
picked
up
Titian
's
brush
for
him
)
had
instructed
his
butler
to
consult
my
wishes
in
relation
to
the
wine
that
I
might
prefer
after
dinner
,
I
was
resolute
enough
to
resist
the
temptation
of
sitting
in
solitary
grandeur
among
bottles
of
my
own
choosing
,
and
sensible
enough
to
ask
the
ladies
'
permission
to
leave
the
table
with
them
habitually
,
on
the
civilised
foreign
plan
,
during
the
period
of
my
residence
at
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
The
drawing
-
room
,
to
which
we
had
now
withdrawn
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
,
was
on
the
ground
-
floor
,
and
was
of
the
same
shape
and
size
as
the
breakfast
-
room
.
<EOS>
Large
glass
doors
at
the
lower
end
opened
on
to
a
terrace
,
beautifully
ornamented
along
its
whole
length
with
a
profusion
of
flowers
.
<EOS>
The
soft
,
hazy
twilight
was
just
shading
leaf
and
blossom
alike
into
harmony
with
its
own
sober
hues
as
we
entered
the
room
,
and
the
sweet
evening
scent
of
the
flowers
met
us
with
its
fragrant
welcome
through
the
open
glass
doors
.
<EOS>
Good
Mrs.
Vesey
(
always
the
first
of
the
party
to
sit
down
)
took
possession
of
an
arm
-
chair
in
a
corner
,
and
dozed
off
comfortably
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
At
my
request
Miss
Fairlie
placed
herself
at
the
piano
.
<EOS>
As
I
followed
her
to
a
seat
near
the
instrument
,
I
saw
Miss
Halcombe
retire
into
a
recess
of
one
of
the
side
windows
,
to
proceed
with
the
search
through
her
mother
's
letters
by
the
last
quiet
rays
of
the
evening
light
.
  
<EOS>
How
vividly
that
peaceful
home
-
picture
of
the
drawing
-
room
comes
back
to
me
while
I
write
!
<EOS>
From
the
place
where
I
sat
I
could
see
Miss
Halcombe
's
graceful
figure
,
half
of
it
in
soft
light
,
half
in
mysterious
shadow
,
bending
intently
over
the
letters
in
her
lap
;
while
,
nearer
to
me
,
the
fair
profile
of
the
player
at
the
piano
was
just
delicately
defined
against
the
faintly
-
deepening
background
of
the
inner
wall
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Outside
,
on
the
terrace
,
the
clustering
flowers
and
long
grasses
and
creepers
waved
so
gently
in
the
light
evening
air
,
that
the
sound
of
their
rustling
never
reached
us
.
<EOS>
The
sky
was
without
a
cloud
,
and
the
dawning
mystery
of
moonlight
began
to
tremble
already
in
the
region
of
the
eastern
heaven
.
<EOS>
The
sense
of
peace
and
seclusion
soothed
all
thought
and
feeling
into
a
rapt
,
unearthly
repose
;
and
the
balmy
quiet
,
that
deepened
ever
with
the
deepening
light
,
seemed
to
hover
over
us
with
a
gentler
influence
still
,
when
there
stole
upon
it
from
the
piano
the
heavenly
tenderness
of
the
music
of
Mozart
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
evening
of
sights
and
sounds
never
to
forget
.
  
<EOS>
We
all
sat
silent
in
the
places
we
had
chosen
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vesey
still
sleeping
,
Miss
Fairlie
still
playing
,
Miss
Halcombe
still
reading
 
till
the
light
failed
us
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
moon
had
stolen
round
to
the
terrace
,
and
soft
,
mysterious
rays
of
light
were
slanting
already
across
the
lower
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
change
from
the
twilight
obscurity
was
so
beautiful
that
we
banished
the
lamps
,
by
common
consent
,
when
the
servant
brought
them
in
,
and
kept
the
large
room
unlighted
,
except
by
the
glimmer
of
the
two
candles
at
the
piano
.
  
<EOS>
For
half
an
hour
more
the
music
still
went
on
.
<EOS>
After
that
the
beauty
of
the
moonlight
view
on
the
terrace
tempted
Miss
Fairlie
out
to
look
at
it
,
and
I
followed
her
.
<EOS>
When
the
candles
at
the
piano
had
been
lighted
Miss
Halcombe
had
changed
her
place
,
so
as
to
continue
her
examination
of
the
letters
by
their
assistance
.
<EOS>
We
left
her
,
on
a
low
chair
,
at
one
side
of
the
instrument
,
so
absorbed
over
her
reading
that
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
when
we
moved
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
been
out
on
the
terrace
together
,
just
in
front
of
the
glass
doors
,
hardly
so
long
as
five
minutes
,
I
should
think
;
and
Miss
Fairlie
was
,
by
my
advice
,
just
tying
her
white
handkerchief
over
her
head
as
a
precaution
against
the
night
air
 
when
I
heard
Miss
Halcombe
's
voice
 
low
,
eager
,
and
altered
from
its
natural
lively
tone
 
pronounce
my
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Hartright
,
"
she
said
,
"
will
you
come
here
for
a
minute
?
<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
entered
the
room
again
immediately
.
<EOS>
The
piano
stood
about
half
-
way
down
along
the
inner
wall
.
<EOS>
On
the
side
of
the
instrument
farthest
from
the
terrace
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
was
sitting
with
the
letters
scattered
on
her
lap
,
and
with
one
in
her
hand
selected
from
them
,
and
held
close
to
the
candle
.
<EOS>
On
the
side
nearest
to
the
terrace
there
stood
a
low
ottoman
,
on
which
I
took
my
place
.
<EOS>
In
this
position
I
was
not
far
from
the
glass
doors
,
and
I
could
see
Miss
Fairlie
plainly
,
as
she
passed
and
repassed
the
opening
on
to
the
terrace
,
walking
slowly
from
end
to
end
of
it
in
the
full
radiance
of
the
moon
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
to
listen
while
I
read
the
concluding
passages
in
this
letter
,
"
said
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
if
you
think
they
throw
any
light
upon
your
strange
adventure
on
the
road
to
London
.
<EOS>
The
letter
is
addressed
by
my
mother
to
her
second
husband
,
Mr.
Fairlie
,
and
the
date
refers
to
a
period
of
between
eleven
and
twelve
years
since
.
<EOS>
At
that
time
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Fairlie
,
and
my
half
-
sister
Laura
,
had
been
living
for
years
in
this
house
;
and
I
was
away
from
them
completing
my
education
at
a
school
in
Paris
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
and
spoke
earnestly
,
and
,
as
I
thought
,
a
little
uneasily
as
well
.
<EOS>
At
the
moment
when
she
raised
the
letter
to
the
candle
before
beginning
to
read
it
,
Miss
Fairlie
passed
us
on
the
terrace
,
looked
in
for
a
moment
,
and
seeing
that
we
were
engaged
,
slowly
walked
on
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
began
to
read
as
follows
:
    
"
"
You
will
be
tired
,
my
dear
Philip
,
of
hearing
perpetually
about
my
schools
and
my
scholars
.
<EOS>
Lay
the
blame
,
pray
,
on
the
dull
uniformity
of
life
at
Limmeridge
,
and
not
on
me
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
this
time
I
have
something
really
interesting
to
tell
you
about
a
new
scholar
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
You
know
old
Mrs.
Kempe
at
the
village
shop
.
<EOS>
Well
,
after
years
of
ailing
,
the
doctor
has
at
last
given
her
up
,
and
she
is
dying
slowly
day
by
day
.
<EOS>
Her
only
living
relation
,
a
sister
,
arrived
last
week
to
take
care
of
her
.
<EOS>
This
sister
comes
all
the
way
from
Hampshire
 
<EOS>
her
name
is
Mrs.
Catherick
.
<EOS>
Four
days
ago
Mrs.
Catherick
came
here
to
see
me
,
and
brought
her
only
child
with
her
,
a
sweet
little
girl
about
a
year
older
than
our
darling
Laura
 
"
"
  
<EOS>
As
the
last
sentence
fell
from
the
reader
's
lips
,
Miss
Fairlie
passed
us
on
the
terrace
once
more
.
<EOS>
She
was
softly
singing
to
herself
one
of
the
melodies
which
she
had
been
playing
earlier
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
waited
till
she
had
passed
out
of
sight
again
,
and
then
went
on
with
the
letter
    
"
"
Mrs
.
Catherick
is
a
decent
,
well
-
behaved
,
respectable
woman
;
middle
-
aged
,
and
with
the
remains
of
having
been
moderately
,
only
moderately
,
nice
-
looking
.
<EOS>
There
is
something
in
her
manner
and
in
her
appearance
,
however
,
which
I
ca
n't
make
out
.
<EOS>
She
is
reserved
about
herself
to
the
point
of
downright
secrecy
,
and
there
is
a
look
in
her
face
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
describe
it
 
which
suggests
to
me
that
she
has
something
on
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
is
altogether
what
you
would
call
a
walking
mystery
.
<EOS>
Her
errand
at
Limmeridge
House
,
however
,
was
simple
enough
.
<EOS>
When
she
left
Hampshire
to
nurse
her
sister
,
Mrs.
Kempe
,
through
her
last
illness
,
she
had
been
obliged
to
bring
her
daughter
with
her
,
through
having
no
one
at
home
to
take
care
of
the
little
girl
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Kempe
may
die
in
a
week
's
time
,
or
may
linger
on
for
months
;
and
Mrs.
Catherick
's
object
was
to
ask
me
to
let
her
daughter
,
Anne
,
have
the
benefit
of
attending
my
school
,
subject
to
the
condition
of
her
being
removed
from
it
to
go
home
again
with
her
mother
,
after
Mrs.
Kempe
's
death
.
<EOS>
I
consented
at
once
,
and
when
Laura
and
I
went
out
for
our
walk
,
we
took
the
little
girl
(
who
is
just
eleven
years
old
)
to
the
school
that
very
day
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
Once
more
Miss
Fairlie
's
figure
,
bright
and
soft
in
its
snowy
muslin
dress
 
<EOS>
her
face
prettily
framed
by
the
white
folds
of
the
handkerchief
which
she
had
tied
under
her
chin
 
passed
by
us
in
the
moonlight
.
<EOS>
Once
more
Miss
Halcombe
waited
till
she
was
out
of
sight
,
and
then
went
on
    
"
"
I
have
taken
a
violent
fancy
,
Philip
,
to
my
new
scholar
,
for
a
reason
which
I
mean
to
keep
till
the
last
for
the
sake
of
surprising
you
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
having
told
me
as
little
about
the
child
as
she
told
me
of
herself
,
I
was
left
to
discover
(
which
I
did
on
the
first
day
when
we
tried
her
at
lessons
)
that
the
poor
little
thing
's
intellect
is
not
developed
as
it
ought
to
be
at
her
age
.
<EOS>
Seeing
this
I
had
her
up
to
the
house
the
next
day
,
and
privately
arranged
with
the
doctor
to
come
and
watch
her
and
question
her
,
and
tell
me
what
he
thought
.
<EOS>
His
opinion
is
that
she
will
grow
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
he
says
her
careful
bringing
-
up
at
school
is
a
matter
of
great
importance
just
now
,
because
her
unusual
slowness
in
acquiring
ideas
implies
an
unusual
tenacity
in
keeping
them
,
when
they
are
once
received
into
her
mind
.
<EOS>
Now
,
my
love
,
you
must
not
imagine
,
in
your
off
-
hand
way
,
that
I
have
been
attaching
myself
to
an
idiot
.
<EOS>
This
poor
little
Anne
Catherick
is
a
sweet
,
affectionate
,
grateful
girl
,
and
says
the
quaintest
,
prettiest
things
(
as
you
shall
judge
by
an
instance
)
,
in
the
most
oddly
sudden
,
surprised
,
half
-
frightened
way
.
<EOS>
Although
she
is
dressed
very
neatly
,
her
clothes
show
a
sad
want
of
taste
in
colour
and
pattern
.
<EOS>
So
I
arranged
,
yesterday
,
that
some
of
our
darling
Laura
's
old
white
frocks
and
white
hats
should
be
altered
for
Anne
Catherick
,
explaining
to
her
that
little
girls
of
her
complexion
looked
neater
and
better
all
in
white
than
in
anything
else
.
<EOS>
She
hesitated
and
seemed
puzzled
for
a
minute
,
then
flushed
up
,
and
appeared
to
understand
.
<EOS>
Her
little
hand
clasped
mine
suddenly
.
<EOS>
She
kissed
it
,
Philip
,
and
said
(
oh
,
so
earnestly
!
)
,
"
I
will
always
wear
white
as
long
as
I
live
.
<EOS>
It
will
help
me
to
remember
you
,
ma'am
,
and
to
think
that
I
am
pleasing
you
still
,
when
I
go
away
and
see
you
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
only
one
specimen
of
the
quaint
things
she
says
so
prettily
.
<EOS>
Poor
little
soul
!
<EOS>
She
shall
have
a
stock
of
white
frocks
,
made
with
good
deep
tucks
,
to
let
out
for
her
as
she
grows
 
"
"
  
Miss
Halcombe
paused
,
and
looked
at
me
across
the
piano
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
the
forlorn
woman
whom
you
met
in
the
high
-
road
seem
young
?
"
she
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Young
enough
to
be
two-
or
three
-
and
-
twenty
?
"
  
"
Yes
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
as
young
as
that
.
"
  
"
And
she
was
strangely
dressed
,
from
head
to
foot
,
all
in
white
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
All
in
white
.
"
  
While
the
answer
was
passing
my
lips
Miss
Fairlie
glided
into
view
on
the
terrace
for
the
third
time
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
proceeding
on
her
walk
,
she
stopped
,
with
her
back
turned
towards
us
,
and
,
leaning
on
the
balustrade
of
the
terrace
,
looked
down
into
the
garden
beyond
.
<EOS>
My
eyes
fixed
upon
the
white
gleam
of
her
muslin
gown
and
head
-
dress
in
the
moonlight
,
and
a
sensation
,
for
which
I
can
find
no
name
 
a
sensation
that
quickened
my
pulse
,
and
raised
a
fluttering
at
my
heart
 
began
to
steal
over
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
in
white
?
"
Miss
Halcombe
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
The
most
important
sentences
in
the
letter
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
are
those
at
the
end
,
which
I
will
read
to
you
immediately
.
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
help
dwelling
a
little
upon
the
coincidence
of
the
white
costume
of
the
woman
you
met
,
and
the
white
frocks
which
produced
that
strange
answer
from
my
mother
's
little
scholar
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
may
have
been
wrong
when
he
discovered
the
child
's
defects
of
intellect
,
and
predicted
that
she
would
"
grow
out
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
She
may
never
have
grown
out
of
them
,
and
the
old
grateful
fancy
about
dressing
in
white
,
which
was
a
serious
feeling
to
the
girl
,
may
be
a
serious
feeling
to
the
woman
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
said
a
few
words
in
answer
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
what
.
<EOS>
All
my
attention
was
concentrated
on
the
white
gleam
of
Miss
Fairlie
's
muslin
dress
.
  
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
the
last
sentences
of
the
letter
,
"
said
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
they
will
surprise
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
she
raised
the
letter
to
the
light
of
the
candle
,
Miss
Fairlie
turned
from
the
balustrade
,
looked
doubtfully
up
and
down
the
terrace
,
advanced
a
step
towards
the
glass
doors
,
and
then
stopped
,
facing
us
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Miss
Halcombe
read
me
the
last
sentences
to
which
she
had
referred
    
"
"
And
now
,
my
love
,
seeing
that
I
am
at
the
end
of
my
paper
,
now
for
the
real
reason
,
the
surprising
reason
,
for
my
fondness
for
little
Anne
Catherick
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Philip
,
although
she
is
not
half
so
pretty
,
she
is
,
nevertheless
,
by
one
of
those
extraordinary
caprices
of
accidental
resemblance
which
one
sometimes
sees
,
the
living
likeness
,
in
her
hair
,
her
complexion
,
the
colour
of
her
eyes
,
and
the
shape
of
her
face
 
"
<EOS>
"
  
I
started
up
from
the
ottoman
before
Miss
Halcombe
could
pronounce
the
next
words
.
<EOS>
A
thrill
of
the
same
feeling
which
ran
through
me
when
the
touch
was
laid
upon
my
shoulder
on
the
lonely
high
-
road
chilled
me
again
.
  
<EOS>
There
stood
Miss
Fairlie
,
a
white
figure
,
alone
in
the
moonlight
;
in
her
attitude
,
in
the
turn
of
her
head
,
in
her
complexion
,
in
the
shape
of
her
face
,
the
living
image
,
at
that
distance
and
under
those
circumstances
,
of
the
woman
in
white
!
<EOS>
The
doubt
which
had
troubled
my
mind
for
hours
and
hours
past
flashed
into
conviction
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
That
"
something
wanting
"
was
my
own
recognition
of
the
ominous
likeness
between
the
fugitive
from
the
asylum
and
my
pupil
at
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
it
!
"
said
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
She
dropped
the
useless
letter
,
and
her
eyes
flashed
as
they
met
mine
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
it
now
,
as
my
mother
saw
it
eleven
years
since
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
 
more
unwillingly
than
I
can
say
.
<EOS>
To
associate
that
forlorn
,
friendless
,
lost
woman
,
even
by
an
accidental
likeness
only
,
with
Miss
Fairlie
,
seems
like
casting
a
shadow
on
the
future
of
the
bright
creature
who
stands
looking
at
us
now
.
<EOS>
Let
me
lose
the
impression
again
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Call
her
in
,
out
of
the
dreary
moonlight
 
<EOS>
pray
call
her
in
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Hartright
,
you
surprise
me
.
<EOS>
Whatever
women
may
be
,
I
thought
that
men
,
in
the
nineteenth
century
,
were
above
superstition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
call
her
in
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
hush
!
<EOS>
She
is
coming
of
her
own
accord
.
<EOS>
Say
nothing
in
her
presence
.
<EOS>
Let
this
discovery
of
the
likeness
be
kept
a
secret
between
you
and
me
.
<EOS>
Come
in
,
Laura
,
come
in
,
and
wake
Mrs.
Vesey
with
the
piano
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Hartright
is
petitioning
for
some
more
music
,
and
he
wants
it
,
this
time
,
of
the
lightest
and
liveliest
kind
.
"
    
<EOS>
So
ended
my
eventful
first
day
at
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
and
I
kept
our
secret
.
<EOS>
After
the
discovery
of
the
likeness
no
fresh
light
seemed
destined
to
break
over
the
mystery
of
the
woman
in
white
.
<EOS>
At
the
first
safe
opportunity
Miss
Halcombe
cautiously
led
her
half
-
sister
to
speak
of
their
mother
,
of
old
times
,
and
of
Anne
Catherick
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
's
recollections
of
the
little
scholar
at
Limmeridge
were
,
however
,
only
of
the
most
vague
and
general
kind
.
<EOS>
She
remembered
the
likeness
between
herself
and
her
mother
's
favourite
pupil
,
as
something
which
had
been
supposed
to
exist
in
past
times
;
but
she
did
not
refer
to
the
gift
of
the
white
dresses
,
or
to
the
singular
form
of
words
in
which
the
child
had
artlessly
expressed
her
gratitude
for
them
.
<EOS>
She
remembered
that
Anne
had
remained
at
Limmeridge
for
a
few
months
only
,
and
had
then
left
it
to
go
back
to
her
home
in
Hampshire
;
but
she
could
not
say
whether
the
mother
and
daughter
had
ever
returned
,
or
had
ever
been
heard
of
afterwards
.
<EOS>
No
further
search
,
on
Miss
Halcombe
's
part
,
through
the
few
letters
of
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
writing
which
she
had
left
unread
,
assisted
in
clearing
up
the
uncertainties
still
left
to
perplex
us
.
<EOS>
We
had
identified
the
unhappy
woman
whom
I
had
met
in
the
night
-
time
with
Anne
Catherick
 
<EOS>
we
had
made
some
advance
,
at
least
,
towards
connecting
the
probably
defective
condition
of
the
poor
creature
's
intellect
with
the
peculiarity
of
her
being
dressed
all
in
white
,
and
with
the
continuance
,
in
her
maturer
years
,
of
her
childish
gratitude
towards
Mrs.
Fairlie
 
<EOS>
and
there
,
so
far
as
we
knew
at
that
time
,
our
discoveries
had
ended
.
  
<EOS>
The
days
passed
on
,
the
weeks
passed
on
,
and
the
track
of
the
golden
autumn
wound
its
bright
way
visibly
through
the
green
summer
of
the
trees
.
<EOS>
Peaceful
,
fast
-
flowing
,
happy
time
!
<EOS>
my
story
glides
by
you
now
as
swiftly
as
you
once
glided
by
me
.
<EOS>
Of
all
the
treasures
of
enjoyment
that
you
poured
so
freely
into
my
heart
,
how
much
is
left
me
that
has
purpose
and
value
enough
to
be
written
on
this
page
?
<EOS>
Nothing
but
the
saddest
of
all
confessions
that
a
man
can
make
 
the
confession
of
his
own
folly
.
  
<EOS>
The
secret
which
that
confession
discloses
should
be
told
with
little
effort
,
for
it
has
indirectly
escaped
me
already
.
<EOS>
The
poor
weak
words
,
which
have
failed
to
describe
Miss
Fairlie
,
have
succeeded
in
betraying
the
sensations
she
awakened
in
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
with
us
all
.
<EOS>
Our
words
are
giants
when
they
do
us
an
injury
,
and
dwarfs
when
they
do
us
a
service
.
  
<EOS>
I
loved
her
.
  
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
how
well
I
know
all
the
sadness
and
all
the
mockery
that
is
contained
in
those
three
words
.
<EOS>
I
can
sigh
over
my
mournful
confession
with
the
tenderest
woman
who
reads
it
and
pities
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
laugh
at
it
as
bitterly
as
the
hardest
man
who
tosses
it
from
him
in
contempt
.
<EOS>
I
loved
her
!
<EOS>
Feel
for
me
,
or
despise
me
,
I
confess
it
with
the
same
immovable
resolution
to
own
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
Was
there
no
excuse
for
me
?
<EOS>
There
was
some
excuse
to
be
found
,
surely
,
in
the
conditions
under
which
my
term
of
hired
service
was
passed
at
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
My
morning
hours
succeeded
each
other
calmly
in
the
quiet
and
seclusion
of
my
own
room
.
<EOS>
I
had
just
work
enough
to
do
,
in
mounting
my
employer
's
drawings
,
to
keep
my
hands
and
eyes
pleasurably
employed
,
while
my
mind
was
left
free
to
enjoy
the
dangerous
luxury
of
its
own
unbridled
thoughts
.
<EOS>
A
perilous
solitude
,
for
it
lasted
long
enough
to
enervate
,
not
long
enough
to
fortify
me
.
<EOS>
A
perilous
solitude
,
for
it
was
followed
by
afternoons
and
evenings
spent
,
day
after
day
and
week
after
week
alone
in
the
society
of
two
women
,
one
of
whom
possessed
all
the
accomplishments
of
grace
,
wit
,
and
high
-
breeding
,
the
other
all
the
charms
of
beauty
,
gentleness
,
and
simple
truth
,
that
can
purify
and
subdue
the
heart
of
man
.
<EOS>
Not
a
day
passed
,
in
that
dangerous
intimacy
of
teacher
and
pupil
,
in
which
my
hand
was
not
close
to
Miss
Fairlie
's
;
my
cheek
,
as
we
bent
together
over
her
sketch
-
book
,
almost
touching
hers
.
<EOS>
The
more
attentively
she
watched
every
movement
of
my
brush
,
the
more
closely
I
was
breathing
the
perfume
of
her
hair
,
and
the
warm
fragrance
of
her
breath
.
<EOS>
It
was
part
of
my
service
to
live
in
the
very
light
of
her
eyes
 
at
one
time
to
be
bending
over
her
,
so
close
to
her
bosom
as
to
tremble
at
the
thought
of
touching
it
;
at
another
,
to
feel
her
bending
over
me
,
bending
so
close
to
see
what
I
was
about
,
that
her
voice
sank
low
when
she
spoke
to
me
,
and
her
ribbons
brushed
my
cheek
in
the
wind
before
she
could
draw
them
back
.
  
<EOS>
The
evenings
which
followed
the
sketching
excursions
of
the
afternoon
varied
,
rather
than
checked
,
these
innocent
,
these
inevitable
familiarities
.
<EOS>
My
natural
fondness
for
the
music
which
she
played
with
such
tender
feeling
,
such
delicate
womanly
taste
,
and
her
natural
enjoyment
of
giving
me
back
,
by
the
practice
of
her
art
,
the
pleasure
which
I
had
offered
to
her
by
the
practice
of
mine
,
only
wove
another
tie
which
drew
us
closer
and
closer
to
one
another
.
<EOS>
The
accidents
of
conversation
;
the
simple
habits
which
regulated
even
such
a
little
thing
as
the
position
of
our
places
at
table
;
the
play
of
Miss
Halcombe
's
ever
-
ready
raillery
,
always
directed
against
my
anxiety
as
teacher
,
while
it
sparkled
over
her
enthusiasm
as
pupil
;
the
harmless
expression
of
poor
Mrs.
Vesey
's
drowsy
approval
,
which
connected
Miss
Fairlie
and
me
as
two
model
young
people
who
never
disturbed
her
 
every
one
of
these
trifles
,
and
many
more
,
combined
to
fold
us
together
in
the
same
domestic
atmosphere
,
and
to
lead
us
both
insensibly
to
the
same
hopeless
end
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
remembered
my
position
,
and
have
put
myself
secretly
on
my
guard
.
<EOS>
I
did
so
,
but
not
till
it
was
too
late
.
<EOS>
All
the
discretion
,
all
the
experience
,
which
had
availed
me
with
other
women
,
and
secured
me
against
other
temptations
,
failed
me
with
her
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
my
profession
,
for
years
past
,
to
be
in
this
close
contact
with
young
girls
of
all
ages
,
and
of
all
orders
of
beauty
.
<EOS>
I
had
accepted
the
position
as
part
of
my
calling
in
life
;
I
had
trained
myself
to
leave
all
the
sympathies
natural
to
my
age
in
my
employer
's
outer
hall
,
as
coolly
as
I
left
my
umbrella
there
before
I
went
upstairs
.
<EOS>
I
had
long
since
learnt
to
understand
,
composedly
and
as
a
matter
of
course
,
that
my
situation
in
life
was
considered
a
guarantee
against
any
of
my
female
pupils
feeling
more
than
the
most
ordinary
interest
in
me
,
and
that
I
was
admitted
among
beautiful
and
captivating
women
much
as
a
harmless
domestic
animal
<EOS>
is
admitted
among
them
.
<EOS>
This
guardian
experience
I
had
gained
early
;
this
guardian
experience
had
sternly
and
strictly
guided
me
straight
along
my
own
poor
narrow
path
,
without
once
letting
me
stray
aside
,
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
and
my
trusty
talisman
were
parted
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
hardly
-
earned
self
-
control
was
as
completely
lost
to
me
as
if
I
had
never
possessed
it
;
lost
to
me
,
as
it
is
lost
every
day
to
other
men
,
in
other
critical
situations
,
where
women
are
concerned
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
now
,
that
I
should
have
questioned
myself
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
asked
why
any
room
in
the
house
was
better
than
home
to
me
when
she
entered
it
,
and
barren
as
a
desert
when
she
went
out
again
 
why
I
always
noticed
and
remembered
the
little
changes
in
her
dress
that
I
had
noticed
and
remembered
in
no
other
woman
's
before
 
why
I
saw
her
,
heard
her
,
and
touched
her
(
when
we
shook
hands
at
night
and
morning
)
as
I
had
never
seen
,
heard
,
and
touched
any
other
woman
in
my
life
?
<EOS>
I
should
have
looked
into
my
own
heart
,
and
found
this
new
growth
springing
up
there
,
and
plucked
it
out
while
it
was
young
.
<EOS>
Why
was
this
easiest
,
simplest
work
of
self
-
culture
always
too
much
for
me
?
<EOS>
The
explanation
has
been
written
already
in
the
three
words
that
were
many
enough
,
and
plain
enough
,
for
my
confession
.
<EOS>
I
loved
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
days
passed
,
the
weeks
passed
;
it
was
approaching
the
third
month
of
my
stay
in
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
The
delicious
monotony
of
life
in
our
calm
seclusion
flowed
on
with
me
,
like
a
smooth
stream
with
a
swimmer
who
glides
down
the
current
.
<EOS>
All
memory
of
the
past
,
all
thought
of
the
future
,
all
sense
of
the
falseness
and
hopelessness
of
my
own
position
,
lay
hushed
within
me
into
deceitful
rest
.
<EOS>
Lulled
by
the
Syren
-
song
that
my
own
heart
sung
to
me
,
with
eyes
shut
to
all
sight
,
and
ears
closed
to
all
sound
of
danger
,
I
drifted
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
fatal
rocks
.
<EOS>
The
warning
that
aroused
me
at
last
,
and
startled
me
into
sudden
,
self
-
accusing
consciousness
of
my
own
weakness
,
was
the
plainest
,
the
truest
,
the
kindest
of
all
warnings
,
for
it
came
silently
from
HER
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
parted
one
night
as
usual
.
<EOS>
No
word
had
fallen
from
my
lips
,
at
that
time
or
at
any
time
before
it
,
that
could
betray
me
,
or
startle
her
into
sudden
knowledge
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
But
when
we
met
again
in
the
morning
,
a
change
had
come
over
her
 
a
change
that
told
me
all
.
  
<EOS>
I
shrank
then
 
<EOS>
I
shrink
still
 
from
invading
the
innermost
sanctuary
of
her
heart
,
and
laying
it
open
to
others
,
as
I
have
laid
open
my
own
.
<EOS>
Let
it
be
enough
to
say
that
the
time
when
she
first
surprised
my
secret
was
,
I
firmly
believe
,
the
time
when
she
first
surprised
her
own
,
and
the
time
,
also
,
when
she
changed
towards
me
in
the
interval
of
one
night
.
<EOS>
Her
nature
,
too
truthful
to
deceive
others
,
was
too
noble
to
deceive
itself
.
<EOS>
When
the
doubt
that
I
had
hushed
asleep
first
laid
its
weary
weight
on
her
heart
,
the
true
face
owned
all
,
and
said
,
in
its
own
frank
,
simple
language
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
for
him
;
I
am
sorry
for
myself
.
  
<EOS>
It
said
this
,
and
more
,
which
I
could
not
then
interpret
.
<EOS>
I
understood
but
too
well
the
change
in
her
manner
,
to
greater
kindness
and
quicker
readiness
in
interpreting
all
my
wishes
,
before
others
 
to
constraint
and
sadness
,
and
nervous
anxiety
to
absorb
herself
in
the
first
occupation
she
could
seize
on
,
whenever
we
happened
to
be
left
together
alone
.
<EOS>
I
understood
why
the
sweet
sensitive
lips
smiled
so
rarely
and
so
restrainedly
now
,
and
why
the
clear
blue
eyes
looked
at
me
,
sometimes
with
the
pity
of
an
angel
,
sometimes
with
the
innocent
perplexity
of
a
child
.
<EOS>
But
the
change
meant
more
than
this
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
coldness
in
her
hand
,
there
was
an
unnatural
immobility
in
her
face
,
there
was
in
all
her
movements
the
mute
expression
of
constant
fear
and
clinging
self
-
reproach
.
<EOS>
The
sensations
that
I
could
trace
to
herself
and
to
me
,
the
unacknowledged
sensations
that
we
were
feeling
in
common
,
were
not
these
.
<EOS>
There
were
certain
elements
of
the
change
in
her
that
were
still
secretly
drawing
us
together
,
and
others
that
were
,
as
secretly
,
beginning
to
drive
us
apart
.
  
<EOS>
In
my
doubt
and
perplexity
,
in
my
vague
suspicion
of
something
hidden
which
I
was
left
to
find
by
my
own
unaided
efforts
,
I
examined
Miss
Halcombe
's
looks
and
manner
for
enlightenment
.
<EOS>
Living
in
such
intimacy
as
ours
,
no
serious
alteration
could
take
place
in
any
one
of
us
which
did
not
sympathetically
affect
the
others
.
<EOS>
The
change
in
Miss
Fairlie
was
reflected
in
her
half
-
sister
.
<EOS>
Although
not
a
word
escaped
Miss
Halcombe
which
hinted
at
an
altered
state
of
feeling
towards
myself
,
her
penetrating
eyes
had
contracted
a
new
habit
of
always
watching
me
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
the
look
was
like
suppressed
anger
,
sometimes
like
suppressed
dread
,
sometimes
like
neither
 
like
nothing
,
in
short
,
which
I
could
understand
.
<EOS>
A
week
elapsed
,
leaving
us
all
three
still
in
this
position
of
secret
constraint
towards
one
another
.
<EOS>
My
situation
,
aggravated
by
the
sense
of
my
own
miserable
weakness
and
forgetfulness
of
myself
,
now
too
late
awakened
in
me
,
was
becoming
intolerable
.
<EOS>
I
felt
that
I
must
cast
off
the
oppression
under
which
I
was
living
,
at
once
and
for
ever
 
yet
how
to
act
for
the
best
,
or
what
to
say
first
,
was
more
than
I
could
tell
.
  
<EOS>
From
this
position
of
helplessness
and
humiliation
I
was
rescued
by
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
Her
lips
told
me
the
bitter
,
the
necessary
,
the
unexpected
truth
;
her
hearty
kindness
sustained
me
under
the
shock
of
hearing
it
;
her
sense
and
courage
turned
to
its
right
use
an
event
which
threatened
the
worst
that
could
happen
,
to
me
and
to
others
,
in
Limmeridge
House
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
on
a
Thursday
in
the
week
,
and
nearly
at
the
end
of
the
third
month
of
my
sojourn
in
Cumberland
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
morning
,
when
I
went
down
into
the
breakfast
-
room
at
the
usual
hour
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
for
the
first
time
since
I
had
known
her
,
was
absent
from
her
customary
place
at
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
was
out
on
the
lawn
.
<EOS>
She
bowed
to
me
,
but
did
not
come
in
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
had
dropped
from
my
lips
,
or
from
hers
,
that
could
unsettle
either
of
us
 
and
yet
<EOS>
the
same
unacknowledged
sense
of
embarrassment
made
us
shrink
alike
from
meeting
one
another
alone
.
<EOS>
She
waited
on
the
lawn
,
and
I
waited
in
the
breakfast
-
room
,
till
Mrs.
Vesey
or
Miss
Halcombe
came
in
.
<EOS>
How
quickly
I
should
have
joined
her
:
how
readily
we
should
have
shaken
hands
,
and
glided
into
our
customary
talk
,
only
a
fortnight
ago
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
Miss
Halcombe
entered
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
preoccupied
look
,
and
she
made
her
apologies
for
being
late
rather
absently
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
detained
,
"
she
said
,
"
by
a
consultation
with
Mr.
Fairlie
on
a
domestic
matter
which
he
wished
to
speak
to
me
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
came
in
from
the
garden
,
and
the
usual
morning
greeting
passed
between
us
.
<EOS>
Her
hand
struck
colder
to
mine
than
ever
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
look
at
me
,
and
she
was
very
pale
.
<EOS>
Even
Mrs.
Vesey
noticed
it
when
she
entered
the
room
a
moment
after
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
is
the
change
in
the
wind
,
"
said
the
old
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
winter
is
coming
 
ah
,
my
love
,
the
winter
is
coming
soon
!
"
  
<EOS>
In
her
heart
and
in
mine
it
had
come
already
!
  
<EOS>
Our
morning
meal
 
once
so
full
of
pleasant
good
-
humoured
discussion
of
the
plans
for
the
day
 
was
short
and
silent
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
seemed
to
feel
the
oppression
of
the
long
pauses
in
the
conversation
,
and
looked
appealingly
to
her
sister
to
fill
them
up
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
,
after
once
or
twice
hesitating
and
checking
herself
,
in
a
most
uncharacteristic
manner
,
spoke
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
your
uncle
this
morning
,
Laura
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
He
thinks
the
purple
room
is
the
one
that
ought
to
be
got
ready
,
and
he
confirms
what
I
told
you
.
<EOS>
Monday
is
the
day
 
not
Tuesday
.
"
  
While
these
words
were
being
spoken
Miss
Fairlie
looked
down
at
the
table
beneath
her
.
<EOS>
Her
fingers
moved
nervously
among
the
crumbs
that
were
scattered
on
the
cloth
.
<EOS>
The
paleness
on
her
cheeks
spread
to
her
lips
,
and
the
lips
themselves
trembled
visibly
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
the
only
person
present
who
noticed
this
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
saw
it
,
too
,
and
at
once
set
us
the
example
of
rising
from
table
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vesey
and
Miss
Fairlie
left
the
room
together
.
<EOS>
The
kind
sorrowful
blue
eyes
looked
at
me
,
for
a
moment
,
with
the
prescient
sadness
of
a
coming
and
a
long
farewell
.
<EOS>
I
felt
the
answering
pang
in
my
own
heart
 
<EOS>
the
pang
that
told
me
I
must
lose
her
soon
,
and
love
her
the
more
unchangeably
for
the
loss
.
  
<EOS>
I
turned
towards
the
garden
when
the
door
had
closed
on
her
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
was
standing
with
her
hat
in
her
hand
,
and
her
shawl
over
her
arm
,
by
the
large
window
that
led
out
to
the
lawn
,
and
was
looking
at
me
attentively
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
any
leisure
time
to
spare
,
"
she
asked
,
"
before
you
begin
to
work
in
your
own
room
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
,
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
time
at
your
service
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
say
a
word
to
you
in
private
,
Mr.
Hartright
.
<EOS>
Get
your
hat
and
come
out
into
the
garden
.
<EOS>
We
are
not
likely
to
be
disturbed
there
at
this
hour
in
the
morning
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
we
stepped
out
on
to
the
lawn
,
one
of
the
under
-
gardeners
 
a
mere
lad
 
passed
us
on
his
way
to
the
house
,
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
stopped
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
letter
for
me
?
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
miss
;
it
's
just
said
to
be
for
Miss
Fairlie
,
"
answered
the
lad
,
holding
out
the
letter
as
he
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
took
it
from
him
and
looked
at
the
address
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
strange
handwriting
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
Who
can
Laura
's
correspondent
be
?
<EOS>
Where
did
you
get
this
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
continued
,
addressing
the
gardener
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
miss
,
"
said
the
lad
,
"
<EOS>
I
just
got
it
from
a
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
woman
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
A
woman
well
stricken
in
age
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
an
old
woman
.
<EOS>
Any
one
you
knew
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
canna
'
tak
'
<EOS>
it
on
mysel
'
to
say
that
she
was
other
than
a
stranger
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Which
way
did
she
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
That
gate
,
"
said
the
under
-
gardener
,
turning
with
great
deliberation
towards
the
south
,
and
embracing
the
whole
of
that
part
of
England
with
one
comprehensive
sweep
of
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Curious
,
"
said
Miss
Halcombe
;
"
I
suppose
it
must
be
a
begging
-
letter
.
<EOS>
There
,
"
she
added
,
handing
the
letter
back
to
the
lad
,
"
take
it
to
the
house
,
and
give
it
to
one
of
the
servants
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
if
you
have
no
objection
,
let
us
walk
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
led
me
across
the
lawn
,
along
the
same
path
by
which
I
had
followed
her
on
the
day
after
my
arrival
at
Limmeridge
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
little
summer
-
house
,
in
which
Laura
Fairlie
and
I
had
first
seen
each
other
,
she
stopped
,
and
broke
the
silence
which
she
had
steadily
maintained
while
we
were
walking
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
have
to
say
to
you
I
can
say
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
those
words
she
entered
the
summer
-
house
,
took
one
of
the
chairs
at
the
little
round
table
inside
,
and
signed
to
me
to
take
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
suspected
what
was
coming
when
she
spoke
to
me
in
the
breakfast
-
room
;
I
felt
certain
of
it
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Hartright
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
am
going
to
begin
by
making
a
frank
avowal
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
say
 
without
phrase
-
making
,
which
I
detest
,
or
paying
compliments
,
which
I
heartily
despise
 
that
I
have
come
,
in
the
course
of
your
residence
with
us
,
to
feel
a
strong
friendly
regard
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
was
predisposed
in
your
favour
when
you
first
told
me
of
your
conduct
towards
that
unhappy
woman
whom
you
met
under
such
remarkable
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Your
management
of
the
affair
might
not
have
been
prudent
,
but
it
showed
the
self
-
control
,
the
delicacy
,
and
the
compassion
of
a
man
who
was
naturally
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
It
made
me
expect
good
things
from
you
,
and
you
have
not
disappointed
my
expectations
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
paused
 
but
held
up
her
hand
at
the
same
time
,
as
a
sign
that
she
awaited
no
answer
from
me
before
she
proceeded
.
<EOS>
When
I
entered
the
summer
-
house
,
no
thought
was
in
me
of
the
woman
in
white
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
Miss
Halcombe
's
own
words
had
put
the
memory
of
my
adventure
back
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
It
remained
there
throughout
the
interview
 
remained
,
and
not
without
a
result
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
your
friend
,
"
she
proceeded
,
"
I
am
going
to
tell
you
,
at
once
,
in
my
own
plain
,
blunt
,
downright
language
,
that
I
have
discovered
your
secret
 
without
help
or
hint
,
mind
,
from
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Hartright
,
you
have
thoughtlessly
allowed
yourself
to
form
an
attachment
 
<EOS>
a
serious
and
devoted
attachment
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
 
to
my
sister
Laura
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
put
you
to
the
pain
of
confessing
it
in
so
many
words
,
because
I
see
and
know
that
you
are
too
honest
to
deny
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
even
blame
you
 
<EOS>
I
pity
you
for
opening
your
heart
to
a
hopeless
affection
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
attempted
to
take
any
underhand
advantage
 
<EOS>
you
have
not
spoken
to
my
sister
in
secret
.
<EOS>
You
are
guilty
of
weakness
and
want
of
attention
to
your
own
best
interests
,
but
of
nothing
worse
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
acted
,
in
any
single
respect
,
less
delicately
and
less
modestly
,
I
should
have
told
you
to
leave
the
house
without
an
instant
's
notice
,
or
an
instant
's
consultation
of
anybody
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
I
blame
the
misfortune
of
your
years
and
your
position
 
I
do
n't
blame
YOU
.
<EOS>
Shake
hands
 
<EOS>
I
have
given
you
pain
;
I
am
going
to
give
you
more
,
but
there
is
no
help
for
it
 
<EOS>
shake
hands
with
your
friend
,
Marian
Halcombe
,
first
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
sudden
kindness
 
the
warm
,
high
-
minded
,
fearless
sympathy
which
met
me
on
such
mercifully
equal
terms
,
which
appealed
with
such
delicate
and
generous
abruptness
straight
to
my
heart
,
my
honour
,
and
my
courage
,
overcame
me
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
look
at
her
when
she
took
my
hand
,
but
my
eves
were
dim
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
thank
her
,
but
my
voice
failed
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
me
,
"
she
said
,
considerately
avoiding
all
notice
of
my
loss
of
self
-
control
.
"
<EOS>
Listen
to
me
,
and
let
us
get
it
over
at
once
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
real
true
relief
to
me
that
I
am
not
obliged
,
in
what
I
have
now
to
say
,
to
enter
into
the
question
 
the
hard
and
cruel
question
as
I
think
it
 
of
social
inequalities
.
<EOS>
Circumstances
which
will
try
you
to
the
quick
,
spare
me
the
ungracious
necessity
of
paining
a
man
who
has
lived
in
friendly
intimacy
under
the
same
roof
with
myself
by
any
humiliating
reference
to
matters
of
rank
and
station
.
<EOS>
You
must
leave
Limmeridge
House
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
before
more
harm
is
done
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
duty
to
say
that
to
you
;
and
it
would
be
equally
my
duty
to
say
it
,
under
precisely
the
same
serious
necessity
,
if
you
were
the
representative
of
the
oldest
and
wealthiest
family
in
England
.
<EOS>
You
must
leave
us
,
not
because
you
are
a
teacher
of
drawing
 
<EOS>
"
  
She
waited
a
moment
,
turned
her
face
full
on
me
,
and
reaching
across
the
table
,
laid
her
hand
firmly
on
my
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
because
you
are
a
teacher
of
drawing
,
"
she
repeated
,
"
but
because
Laura
Fairlie
is
engaged
to
be
married
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
last
word
went
like
a
bullet
to
my
heart
.
<EOS>
My
arm
lost
all
sensation
of
the
hand
that
grasped
it
.
<EOS>
I
never
moved
and
never
spoke
.
<EOS>
The
sharp
autumn
breeze
that
scattered
the
dead
leaves
at
our
feet
came
as
cold
to
me
,
on
a
sudden
,
as
if
my
own
mad
hopes
were
dead
leaves
too
,
whirled
away
by
the
wind
like
the
rest
.
<EOS>
Hopes
!
<EOS>
Betrothed
,
or
not
betrothed
,
she
was
equally
far
from
me
.
<EOS>
Would
other
men
have
remembered
that
in
my
place
?
<EOS>
Not
if
they
had
loved
her
as
I
did
.
  
<EOS>
The
pang
passed
,
and
nothing
but
the
dull
numbing
pain
of
it
remained
.
<EOS>
I
felt
Miss
Halcombe
's
hand
again
,
tightening
its
hold
on
my
arm
 
<EOS>
I
raised
my
head
and
looked
at
her
.
<EOS>
Her
large
black
eyes
were
rooted
on
me
,
watching
the
white
change
on
my
face
,
which
I
felt
,
and
which
she
saw
.
  
<EOS>
"
Crush
it
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Here
,
where
you
first
saw
her
,
crush
it
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
shrink
under
it
like
a
woman
.
<EOS>
Tear
it
out
;
trample
it
under
foot
like
a
man
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
suppressed
vehemence
with
which
she
spoke
,
the
strength
which
her
will
 
concentrated
in
the
look
she
fixed
on
me
,
and
in
the
hold
on
my
arm
that
she
had
not
yet
relinquished
 
communicated
to
mine
,
steadied
me
.
<EOS>
We
both
waited
for
a
minute
in
silence
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
that
time
I
had
justified
her
generous
faith
in
my
manhood
 
<EOS>
I
had
,
outwardly
at
least
,
recovered
my
self
-
control
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
yourself
again
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Enough
myself
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
to
ask
your
pardon
and
hers
.
<EOS>
Enough
myself
to
be
guided
by
your
advice
,
and
to
prove
my
gratitude
in
that
way
,
if
I
can
prove
it
in
no
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
proved
it
already
,
"
she
answered
,
"
by
those
words
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Hartright
,
concealment
is
at
an
end
between
us
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
affect
to
hide
from
you
what
my
sister
has
unconsciously
shown
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
must
leave
us
for
her
sake
,
as
well
as
for
your
own
.
<EOS>
Your
presence
here
,
your
necessary
intimacy
with
us
,
harmless
as
it
has
been
,
God
knows
,
in
all
other
respects
,
has
unsteadied
her
and
made
her
wretched
.
<EOS>
I
,
who
love
her
better
than
my
own
life
 
<EOS>
I
,
who
have
learnt
to
believe
in
that
pure
,
noble
,
innocent
nature
as
I
believe
in
my
religion
 
know
<EOS>
but
too
well
the
secret
misery
of
self
-
reproach
that
she
has
been
suffering
since
the
first
shadow
of
a
feeling
disloyal
to
her
marriage
engagement
entered
her
heart
in
spite
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
 
it
would
be
useless
to
attempt
to
say
it
after
what
has
happened
 
that
her
engagement
has
ever
had
a
strong
hold
on
her
affections
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
engagement
of
honour
,
not
of
love
;
her
father
sanctioned
it
on
his
deathbed
,
two
years
since
;
she
herself
neither
welcomed
it
nor
shrank
from
it
 
<EOS>
she
was
content
to
make
it
.
<EOS>
Till
you
came
here
she
was
in
the
position
of
hundreds
of
other
women
,
who
marry
men
without
being
greatly
attracted
to
them
or
greatly
repelled
by
them
,
and
who
learn
to
love
them
(
when
they
do
n't
learn
to
hate
!
)
<EOS>
after
marriage
,
instead
of
before
.
<EOS>
I
hope
more
earnestly
than
words
can
say
 
<EOS>
and
you
should
have
the
self
-
sacrificing
courage
to
hope
too
 
that
the
new
thoughts
and
feelings
which
have
disturbed
the
old
calmness
and
the
old
content
have
not
taken
root
too
deeply
to
be
ever
removed
.
<EOS>
Your
absence
(
if
I
had
less
belief
in
your
honour
,
and
your
courage
,
and
your
sense
,
I
should
not
trust
to
them
as
I
am
trusting
now
)
<EOS>
your
absence
will
help
my
efforts
,
and
time
will
help
us
all
three
.
<EOS>
It
is
something
to
know
that
my
first
confidence
in
you
was
not
all
misplaced
.
<EOS>
It
is
something
to
know
that
you
will
not
be
less
honest
,
less
manly
,
less
considerate
towards
the
pupil
whose
relation
to
yourself
you
have
had
the
misfortune
to
forget
,
than
towards
the
stranger
and
the
outcast
whose
appeal
to
you
was
not
made
in
vain
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
the
chance
reference
to
the
woman
in
white
!
<EOS>
Was
there
no
possibility
of
speaking
of
Miss
Fairlie
and
of
me
without
raising
the
memory
of
Anne
Catherick
,
and
setting
her
between
us
like
a
fatality
that
it
was
hopeless
to
avoid
?
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
what
apology
I
can
make
to
Mr.
Fairlie
for
breaking
my
engagement
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
when
to
go
after
that
apology
is
accepted
.
<EOS>
I
promise
implicit
obedience
to
you
and
to
your
advice
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Time
is
every
way
of
importance
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
You
heard
me
refer
this
morning
to
Monday
next
,
and
to
the
necessity
of
setting
the
purple
room
in
order
.
<EOS>
The
visitor
whom
we
expect
on
Monday
 
"
  
I
could
not
wait
for
her
to
be
more
explicit
.
<EOS>
Knowing
what
I
knew
now
,
the
memory
of
Miss
Fairlie
's
look
and
manner
at
the
breakfast
-
table
told
me
that
the
expected
visitor
at
Limmeridge
House
was
her
future
husband
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
force
it
back
;
but
something
rose
within
me
at
that
moment
stronger
than
my
own
will
,
and
I
interrupted
Miss
Halcombe
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
to
-
day
,
"
I
said
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
sooner
the
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
to
-
day
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
The
only
reason
you
can
assign
to
Mr.
Fairlie
for
your
departure
,
before
the
end
of
your
engagement
,
must
be
that
an
unforeseen
necessity
compels
you
to
ask
his
permission
to
return
at
once
to
London
.
<EOS>
You
must
wait
till
to
-
morrow
to
tell
him
that
,
at
the
time
when
the
post
comes
in
,
because
he
will
then
understand
the
sudden
change
in
your
plans
,
by
associating
it
with
the
arrival
of
a
letter
from
London
.
<EOS>
It
is
miserable
and
sickening
to
descend
to
deceit
,
even
of
the
most
harmless
kind
 
<EOS>
but
I
know
Mr.
Fairlie
,
and
if
you
once
excite
his
suspicions
that
you
are
trifling
with
him
,
he
will
refuse
to
release
you
.
<EOS>
Speak
to
him
on
Friday
morning
:
occupy
yourself
afterwards
(
for
the
sake
of
your
own
interests
with
your
employer
)
in
leaving
your
unfinished
work
in
as
little
confusion
as
possible
,
and
quit
this
place
on
Saturday
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
time
enough
then
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
for
you
,
and
for
all
of
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
Before
I
could
assure
her
that
she
might
depend
on
my
acting
in
the
strictest
accordance
with
her
wishes
,
we
were
both
startled
by
advancing
footsteps
in
the
shrubbery
.
<EOS>
Some
one
was
coming
from
the
house
to
seek
for
us
!
<EOS>
I
felt
the
blood
rush
into
my
cheeks
and
then
leave
them
again
.
<EOS>
Could
the
third
person
who
was
fast
approaching
us
,
at
such
a
time
and
under
such
circumstances
,
be
Miss
Fairlie
?
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
relief
 
so
sadly
,
so
hopelessly
was
my
position
towards
her
changed
already
 
<EOS>
it
was
absolutely
a
relief
to
me
,
when
the
person
who
had
disturbed
us
appeared
at
the
entrance
of
the
summer
-
house
,
and
proved
to
be
only
Miss
Fairlie
's
maid
.
  
<EOS>
"
Could
I
speak
to
you
for
a
moment
,
miss
?
"
said
the
girl
,
in
rather
a
flurried
,
unsettled
manner
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
descended
the
steps
into
the
shrubbery
,
and
walked
aside
a
few
paces
with
the
maid
.
  
<EOS>
Left
by
myself
,
my
mind
reverted
,
with
a
sense
of
forlorn
wretchedness
which
it
is
not
in
any
words
that
I
can
find
to
describe
,
to
my
approaching
return
to
the
solitude
and
the
despair
of
my
lonely
London
home
.
<EOS>
Thoughts
of
my
kind
old
mother
,
and
of
my
sister
,
who
had
rejoiced
with
her
so
innocently
over
my
prospects
in
Cumberland
 
thoughts
whose
long
banishment
from
my
heart
it
was
now
my
shame
and
my
reproach
to
realise
for
the
first
time
 
came
back
to
me
with
the
loving
mournfulness
of
old
,
neglected
friends
.
<EOS>
My
mother
and
my
sister
,
what
would
they
feel
when
I
returned
to
them
from
my
broken
engagement
,
with
the
confession
of
my
miserable
secret
 
they
who
had
parted
from
me
so
hopefully
on
that
last
happy
night
in
the
Hampstead
cottage
!
  
<EOS>
Anne
Catherick
again
!
<EOS>
Even
the
memory
of
the
farewell
evening
with
my
mother
and
my
sister
could
not
return
to
me
now
unconnected
with
that
other
memory
of
the
moonlight
walk
back
to
London
.
<EOS>
What
did
it
mean
?
<EOS>
Were
that
woman
and
I
to
meet
once
more
?
<EOS>
It
was
possible
,
at
the
least
.
<EOS>
Did
she
know
that
I
lived
in
London
?
<EOS>
Yes
;
I
had
told
her
so
,
either
before
or
after
that
strange
question
of
hers
,
when
she
had
asked
me
so
distrustfully
if
I
knew
many
men
of
the
rank
of
Baronet
.
<EOS>
Either
before
or
after
 
my
mind
was
not
calm
enough
,
then
,
to
remember
which
.
  
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
elapsed
before
Miss
Halcombe
dismissed
the
maid
and
came
back
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
,
too
,
looked
flurried
and
unsettled
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
arranged
all
that
is
necessary
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
understood
each
other
,
as
friends
should
,
and
we
may
go
back
at
once
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
am
uneasy
about
Laura
.
<EOS>
She
has
sent
to
say
she
wants
to
see
me
directly
,
and
the
maid
reports
that
her
mistress
is
apparently
very
much
agitated
by
a
letter
that
she
has
received
this
morning
 
the
same
letter
,
no
doubt
,
which
I
sent
on
to
the
house
before
we
came
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
retraced
our
steps
together
hastily
along
the
shrubbery
path
.
<EOS>
Although
Miss
Halcombe
had
ended
all
that
she
thought
it
necessary
to
say
on
her
side
,
I
had
not
ended
all
that
I
wanted
to
say
on
mine
.
<EOS>
From
the
moment
when
I
had
discovered
that
the
expected
visitor
at
Limmeridge
was
Miss
Fairlie
's
future
husband
,
I
had
felt
a
bitter
curiosity
,
a
burning
envious
eagerness
,
to
know
who
he
was
.
<EOS>
It
was
possible
that
a
future
opportunity
of
putting
the
question
might
not
easily
offer
,
so
<EOS>
I
risked
asking
it
on
our
way
back
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
that
you
are
kind
enough
to
tell
me
we
have
understood
each
other
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
I
said
,
"
now
that
you
are
sure
of
my
gratitude
for
your
forbearance
and
my
obedience
to
your
wishes
,
may
I
venture
to
ask
who
"
 
(
I
hesitated
 
I
had
forced
myself
to
think
of
him
,
but
it
was
harder
still
to
speak
of
him
,
as
her
promised
husband
)
 
<EOS>
"
who
the
gentleman
engaged
to
Miss
Fairlie
is
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
mind
was
evidently
occupied
with
the
message
she
had
received
from
her
sister
.
<EOS>
She
answered
in
a
hasty
,
absent
way
    
"
A
gentleman
of
large
property
in
Hampshire
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hampshire
!
<EOS>
Anne
Catherick
's
native
place
.
<EOS>
Again
,
and
yet
again
,
the
woman
in
white
.
<EOS>
There
WAS
a
fatality
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
his
name
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
as
quietly
and
indifferently
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
SIR
 
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
!
<EOS>
Anne
Catherick
's
question
 
<EOS>
that
suspicious
question
about
the
men
of
the
rank
of
Baronet
whom
I
might
happen
to
know
 
had
hardly
been
dismissed
from
my
mind
by
Miss
Halcombe
's
return
to
me
in
the
summer
-
house
,
before
it
was
recalled
again
by
her
own
answer
.
<EOS>
I
stopped
suddenly
,
and
looked
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Percival
Glyde
,
"
she
repeated
,
imagining
that
I
had
not
heard
her
former
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Knight
,
or
Baronet
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
with
an
agitation
that
I
could
hide
no
longer
.
  
<EOS>
She
paused
for
a
moment
,
and
then
answered
,
rather
coldly
    
"
Baronet
,
of
course
.
"
    
<EOS>
Not
a
word
more
was
said
,
on
either
side
,
as
we
walked
back
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
hastened
immediately
to
her
sister
's
room
,
and
I
withdrew
to
my
studio
to
set
in
order
all
of
Mr.
Fairlie
's
drawings
that
I
had
not
yet
mounted
and
restored
before
I
resigned
them
to
the
care
of
other
hands
.
<EOS>
Thoughts
that
I
had
hitherto
restrained
,
thoughts
that
made
my
position
harder
than
ever
to
endure
,
crowded
on
me
now
that
I
was
alone
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
engaged
to
be
married
,
and
her
future
husband
was
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
A
man
of
the
rank
of
Baronet
,
and
the
owner
of
property
in
Hampshire
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
hundreds
of
baronets
in
England
,
and
dozens
of
landowners
in
Hampshire
.
<EOS>
Judging
by
the
ordinary
rules
of
evidence
,
I
had
not
the
shadow
of
a
reason
,
thus
far
,
for
connecting
Sir
Percival
Glyde
with
the
suspicious
words
of
inquiry
that
had
been
spoken
to
me
by
the
woman
in
white
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
I
did
connect
him
with
them
.
<EOS>
Was
it
because
he
had
now
become
associated
in
my
mind
with
Miss
Fairlie
,
Miss
Fairlie
being
,
in
her
turn
,
associated
with
Anne
Catherick
,
since
the
night
when
I
had
discovered
the
ominous
likeness
between
them
?
<EOS>
Had
the
events
of
the
morning
so
unnerved
me
already
that
I
was
at
the
mercy
of
any
delusion
which
common
chances
and
common
coincidences
might
suggest
to
my
imagination
?
<EOS>
Impossible
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
could
only
feel
that
what
had
passed
between
Miss
Halcombe
and
myself
,
on
our
way
from
the
summer
-
house
,
had
affected
me
very
strangely
.
<EOS>
The
foreboding
of
some
undiscoverable
danger
lying
hid
from
us
all
in
the
darkness
of
the
future
was
strong
on
me
.
<EOS>
The
doubt
whether
I
was
not
linked
already
to
a
chain
of
events
which
even
my
approaching
departure
from
Cumberland
would
be
powerless
to
snap
asunder
 
<EOS>
the
doubt
whether
we
any
of
us
saw
the
end
as
the
end
<EOS>
would
really
be
 
gathered
more
and
more
darkly
over
my
mind
.
<EOS>
Poignant
as
it
was
,
the
sense
of
suffering
caused
by
the
miserable
end
of
my
brief
,
presumptuous
love
seemed
to
be
blunted
and
deadened
by
the
still
stronger
sense
of
something
obscurely
impending
,
something
invisibly
threatening
,
that
Time
was
holding
over
our
heads
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
been
engaged
with
the
drawings
little
more
than
half
an
hour
,
when
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
opened
,
on
my
answering
;
and
,
to
my
surprise
,
Miss
Halcombe
entered
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Her
manner
was
angry
and
agitated
.
<EOS>
She
caught
up
a
chair
for
herself
before
I
could
give
her
one
,
and
sat
down
in
it
,
close
at
my
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Hartright
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
had
hoped
that
all
painful
subjects
of
conversation
were
exhausted
between
us
,
for
to
-
day
at
least
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
to
be
so
.
<EOS>
There
is
some
underhand
villainy
at
work
to
frighten
my
sister
about
her
approaching
marriage
.
<EOS>
You
saw
me
send
the
gardener
on
to
the
house
,
with
a
letter
addressed
,
in
a
strange
handwriting
,
to
Miss
Fairlie
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
letter
is
an
anonymous
letter
 
a
vile
attempt
to
injure
Sir
Percival
Glyde
in
my
sister
's
estimation
.
<EOS>
It
has
so
agitated
and
alarmed
her
that
I
have
had
the
greatest
possible
difficulty
in
composing
her
spirits
sufficiently
to
allow
me
to
leave
her
room
and
come
here
.
<EOS>
I
know
this
is
a
family
matter
on
which
I
ought
not
to
consult
you
,
and
in
which
you
can
feel
no
concern
or
interest
 
"
  
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
I
feel
the
strongest
possible
concern
and
interest
in
anything
that
affects
Miss
Fairlie
's
happiness
or
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
only
person
in
the
house
,
or
out
of
it
,
who
can
advise
me
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
,
in
his
state
of
health
and
with
his
horror
of
difficulties
and
mysteries
of
all
kinds
,
is
not
to
be
thought
of
.
<EOS>
The
clergyman
is
a
good
,
weak
man
,
who
knows
nothing
out
of
the
routine
of
his
duties
;
and
our
neighbours
are
just
the
sort
of
comfortable
,
jog
-
trot
acquaintances
whom
one
can
not
disturb
in
times
of
trouble
and
danger
.
<EOS>
What
I
want
to
know
is
this
:
ought
I
at
once
to
take
such
steps
as
I
can
to
discover
the
writer
of
the
letter
?
<EOS>
or
ought
I
to
wait
,
and
apply
to
Mr.
Fairlie
's
legal
adviser
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
It
is
a
question
 
perhaps
a
very
important
one
 
of
gaining
or
losing
a
day
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
what
you
think
,
Mr.
Hartright
.
<EOS>
If
necessity
had
not
already
obliged
me
to
take
you
into
my
confidence
under
very
delicate
circumstances
,
even
my
helpless
situation
would
,
perhaps
,
be
no
excuse
for
me
.
<EOS>
But
as
things
are
I
can
not
surely
be
wrong
,
after
all
that
has
passed
between
us
,
in
forgetting
that
you
are
a
friend
of
only
three
months
'
standing
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
gave
me
the
letter
.
<EOS>
It
began
abruptly
,
without
any
preliminary
form
of
address
,
as
follows
    
"
Do
you
believe
in
dreams
?
<EOS>
I
hope
,
for
your
own
sake
,
that
you
do
.
<EOS>
See
what
Scripture
says
about
dreams
and
their
fulfilment
<EOS>
(
Genesis
xl
.
8
,
xli
.
25
<EOS>
;
Daniel
iv
.
18
-
25
)
,
and
take
the
warning
I
send
you
before
it
is
too
late
.
  
"
Last
night
I
dreamed
about
you
,
Miss
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
I
dreamed
that
I
was
standing
inside
the
communion
rails
of
a
church
 
<EOS>
I
on
one
side
of
the
altar
-
table
,
and
the
clergyman
,
with
his
surplice
and
his
prayer
-
book
,
on
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
After
a
time
there
walked
towards
us
,
down
the
aisle
of
the
church
,
a
man
and
a
woman
,
coming
to
be
married
.
<EOS>
You
were
the
woman
.
<EOS>
You
looked
so
pretty
and
innocent
in
your
beautiful
white
silk
dress
,
and
your
long
white
lace
veil
,
that
my
heart
felt
for
you
,
and
the
tears
came
into
my
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
were
tears
of
pity
,
young
lady
,
that
heaven
blesses
and
instead
of
falling
from
my
eyes
like
the
everyday
tears
that
we
all
of
us
shed
,
they
turned
into
two
rays
of
light
which
slanted
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
man
standing
at
the
altar
with
you
,
till
they
touched
his
breast
.
<EOS>
The
two
rays
sprang
ill
arches
like
two
rainbows
between
me
and
him
.
<EOS>
I
looked
along
them
,
and
I
saw
down
into
his
inmost
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
outside
of
the
man
you
were
marrying
was
fair
enough
to
see
.
<EOS>
He
was
neither
tall
nor
short
 
<EOS>
he
was
a
little
below
the
middle
size
.
<EOS>
A
light
,
active
,
high
-
spirited
man
 
about
five
-
and
-
forty
years
old
,
to
look
at
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
pale
face
,
and
was
bald
over
the
forehead
,
but
had
dark
hair
on
the
rest
of
his
head
.
<EOS>
His
beard
was
shaven
on
his
chin
,
but
was
let
to
grow
,
of
a
fine
rich
brown
,
on
his
cheeks
and
his
upper
lip
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
brown
too
,
and
very
bright
;
his
nose
straight
and
handsome
and
delicate
enough
to
have
done
for
a
woman
's
.
<EOS>
His
hands
the
same
.
<EOS>
He
was
troubled
from
time
to
time
with
a
dry
hacking
cough
,
and
when
he
put
up
his
white
right
hand
to
his
mouth
,
he
showed
the
red
scar
of
an
old
wound
across
the
back
of
it
.
<EOS>
Have
I
dreamt
of
the
right
man
?
<EOS>
You
know
best
,
Miss
Fairlie
and
you
can
say
if
I
was
deceived
or
not
.
<EOS>
Read
next
,
what
I
saw
beneath
the
outside
 
<EOS>
I
entreat
you
,
read
,
and
profit
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
looked
along
the
two
rays
of
light
,
and
I
saw
down
into
his
inmost
heart
.
<EOS>
It
was
black
as
night
,
and
on
it
were
written
,
in
the
red
flaming
letters
which
are
the
handwriting
of
the
fallen
angel
,
"
Without
pity
and
without
remorse
.
<EOS>
He
has
strewn
with
misery
the
paths
of
others
,
and
he
will
live
to
strew
with
misery
the
path
of
this
woman
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
"
I
read
that
,
and
then
the
rays
of
light
shifted
and
pointed
over
his
shoulder
;
and
there
,
behind
him
,
stood
a
fiend
laughing
.
<EOS>
And
the
rays
of
light
shifted
once
more
,
and
pointed
over
your
shoulder
;
and
there
behind
you
,
stood
an
angel
weeping
.
<EOS>
And
the
rays
of
light
shifted
for
the
third
time
,
and
pointed
straight
between
you
and
that
man
.
<EOS>
They
widened
and
widened
,
thrusting
you
both
asunder
,
one
from
the
other
.
<EOS>
And
the
clergyman
looked
for
the
marriage
-
service
in
vain
:
it
was
gone
out
of
the
book
,
and
he
shut
up
the
leaves
,
and
put
it
from
him
in
despair
.
<EOS>
And
I
woke
with
my
eyes
full
of
tears
and
my
heart
beating
 
for
I
believe
in
dreams
.
  
<EOS>
"
Believe
too
,
Miss
Fairlie
 
<EOS>
I
beg
of
you
,
for
your
own
sake
,
believe
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
Joseph
and
Daniel
,
and
others
in
Scripture
,
believed
in
dreams
.
<EOS>
Inquire
into
the
past
life
of
that
man
with
the
scar
on
his
hand
,
before
you
say
the
words
that
make
you
his
miserable
wife
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
give
you
this
warning
on
my
account
,
but
on
yours
.
<EOS>
I
have
an
interest
in
your
well
-
being
that
will
live
as
long
as
I
draw
breath
.
<EOS>
Your
mother
's
daughter
has
a
tender
place
in
my
heart
 
for
your
mother
<EOS>
was
my
first
,
my
best
,
my
only
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
the
extraordinary
letter
ended
,
without
signature
of
any
sort
.
  
<EOS>
The
handwriting
afforded
no
prospect
of
a
clue
.
<EOS>
It
was
traced
on
ruled
lines
,
in
the
cramped
,
conventional
,
copy
-
book
character
technically
termed
"
small
hand
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
feeble
and
faint
,
and
defaced
by
blots
,
but
had
otherwise
nothing
to
distinguish
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
not
an
illiterate
letter
,
"
said
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
and
at
the
same
time
,
it
is
surely
too
incoherent
to
be
the
letter
of
an
educated
person
in
the
higher
ranks
of
life
.
<EOS>
The
reference
to
the
bridal
dress
and
veil
,
and
other
little
expressions
,
seem
to
point
to
it
as
the
production
of
some
woman
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
,
Mr.
Hartright
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
too
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
to
be
not
only
the
letter
of
a
woman
,
but
of
a
woman
whose
mind
must
be
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Deranged
?
"
suggested
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
"
It
struck
me
in
that
light
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
did
not
answer
.
<EOS>
While
I
was
speaking
,
my
eyes
rested
on
the
last
sentence
of
the
letter
:
"
Your
mother
's
daughter
has
a
tender
place
in
my
heart
 
for
your
mother
<EOS>
was
my
first
,
my
best
,
my
only
friend
.
<EOS>
"
Those
words
and
the
doubt
which
had
just
escaped
me
as
to
the
sanity
of
the
writer
of
the
letter
,
acting
together
on
my
mind
,
suggested
an
idea
,
which
I
was
literally
afraid
to
express
openly
,
or
even
to
encourage
secretly
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
doubt
whether
my
own
faculties
were
not
in
danger
of
losing
their
balance
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
almost
like
a
monomania
to
be
tracing
back
everything
strange
that
happened
,
everything
unexpected
that
was
said
,
always
to
the
same
hidden
source
and
the
same
sinister
influence
.
<EOS>
I
resolved
,
this
time
,
in
defence
of
my
own
courage
and
my
own
sense
,
to
come
to
no
decision
that
plain
fact
did
not
warrant
,
and
to
turn
my
back
resolutely
on
everything
that
tempted
me
in
the
shape
of
surmise
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
we
have
any
chance
of
tracing
the
person
who
has
written
this
,
"
I
said
,
returning
the
letter
to
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
there
can
be
no
harm
in
seizing
our
opportunity
the
moment
it
offers
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
ought
to
speak
to
the
gardener
again
about
the
elderly
woman
who
gave
him
the
letter
,
and
then
to
continue
our
inquiries
in
the
village
.
<EOS>
But
first
let
me
ask
a
question
.
<EOS>
You
mentioned
just
now
the
alternative
of
consulting
Mr.
Fairlie
's
legal
adviser
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Is
there
no
possibility
of
communicating
with
him
earlier
?
<EOS>
Why
not
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
explain
,
"
replied
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
by
entering
into
certain
particulars
,
connected
with
my
sister
's
marriage
-
engagement
,
which
I
did
not
think
it
necessary
or
desirable
to
mention
to
you
this
morning
.
<EOS>
One
of
Sir
Percival
Glyde
's
objects
in
coming
here
on
Monday
,
is
to
fix
the
period
of
his
marriage
,
which
has
hitherto
been
left
quite
unsettled
.
<EOS>
He
is
anxious
that
the
event
should
take
place
before
the
end
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Does
Miss
Fairlie
know
of
that
wish
?
"
I
asked
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
no
suspicion
of
it
,
and
after
what
has
happened
,
I
shall
not
take
the
responsibility
upon
myself
of
enlightening
her
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
has
only
mentioned
his
views
to
Mr.
Fairlie
,
who
has
told
me
himself
that
he
is
ready
and
anxious
,
as
Laura
's
guardian
,
to
forward
them
.
<EOS>
He
has
written
to
London
,
to
the
family
solicitor
,
Mr.
Gilmore
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gilmore
happens
to
be
away
in
Glasgow
on
business
,
and
he
has
replied
by
proposing
to
stop
at
Limmeridge
House
on
his
way
back
to
town
.
<EOS>
He
will
arrive
to
-
morrow
,
and
will
stay
with
us
a
few
days
,
so
as
to
allow
Sir
Percival
time
to
plead
his
own
cause
.
<EOS>
If
he
succeeds
,
Mr.
Gilmore
will
then
return
to
London
,
taking
with
him
his
instructions
for
my
sister
's
marriage
-
settlement
.
<EOS>
You
understand
now
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
why
I
speak
of
waiting
to
take
legal
advice
until
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Gilmore
is
the
old
and
tried
friend
of
two
generations
of
Fairlies
,
and
we
can
trust
him
,
as
we
could
trust
no
one
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
marriage
-
settlement
!
<EOS>
The
mere
hearing
of
those
two
words
stung
me
with
a
jealous
despair
that
was
poison
to
my
higher
and
better
instincts
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
think
 
it
is
hard
to
confess
this
,
but
I
must
suppress
nothing
from
beginning
to
end
of
the
terrible
story
that
I
now
stand
committed
to
reveal
 
<EOS>
I
began
to
think
,
with
a
hateful
eagerness
of
hope
,
of
the
vague
charges
against
Sir
Percival
Glyde
which
the
anonymous
letter
contained
.
<EOS>
What
if
those
wild
accusations
rested
on
a
foundation
of
truth
?
<EOS>
What
if
their
truth
could
be
proved
before
the
fatal
words
of
consent
were
spoken
,
and
the
marriage
-
settlement
was
drawn
?
<EOS>
I
have
tried
to
think
since
,
that
the
feeling
which
then
animated
me
began
and
ended
in
pure
devotion
to
Miss
Fairlie
's
interests
,
but
I
have
never
succeeded
in
deceiving
myself
into
believing
it
,
and
I
must
not
now
attempt
to
deceive
others
.
<EOS>
The
feeling
began
and
ended
in
reckless
,
vindictive
,
hopeless
hatred
of
the
man
who
was
to
marry
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
we
are
to
find
out
anything
,
"
I
said
,
<EOS>
speaking
under
the
new
influence
which
was
now
directing
me
,
"
we
had
better
not
let
another
minute
slip
by
us
unemployed
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
suggest
,
once
more
,
the
propriety
of
questioning
the
gardener
a
second
time
,
and
of
inquiring
in
the
village
immediately
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
may
be
of
help
to
you
in
both
cases
,
"
said
Miss
Halcombe
,
rising
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
go
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
at
once
,
and
do
the
best
we
can
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
the
door
in
my
hand
to
open
it
for
her
 
<EOS>
but
I
stopped
,
on
a
sudden
,
to
ask
an
important
question
before
we
set
forth
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
of
the
paragraphs
of
the
anonymous
letter
,
"
I
said
,
"
contains
some
sentences
of
minute
personal
description
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
Glyde
's
name
is
not
mentioned
,
I
know
 
but
does
that
description
at
all
resemble
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Accurately
 
even
in
stating
his
age
to
be
forty
-
five
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Forty
-
five
;
and
<EOS>
she
was
not
yet
twenty
-
one
!
<EOS>
Men
of
his
age
married
wives
of
her
age
every
day
 
and
experience
had
shown
those
marriages
to
be
often
the
happiest
ones
.
<EOS>
I
knew
that
 
and
yet
even
the
mention
of
his
age
<EOS>
,
when
I
contrasted
it
with
hers
,
added
to
my
blind
hatred
and
distrust
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Accurately
,
"
Miss
Halcombe
continued
,
"
even
to
the
scar
on
his
right
hand
,
which
is
the
scar
of
a
wound
that
he
received
years
since
when
he
was
travelling
in
Italy
.
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
doubt
that
every
peculiarity
of
his
personal
appearance
is
thoroughly
well
known
to
the
writer
of
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Even
a
cough
that
he
is
troubled
with
is
mentioned
,
if
I
remember
right
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
mentioned
correctly
.
<EOS>
He
treats
it
lightly
himself
,
though
it
sometimes
makes
his
friends
anxious
about
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
no
whispers
have
ever
been
heard
against
his
character
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Hartright
!
<EOS>
I
hope
you
are
not
unjust
enough
to
let
that
infamous
letter
influence
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
felt
the
blood
rush
into
my
cheeks
,
for
I
knew
that
it
HAD
influenced
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
"
I
answered
confusedly
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
had
no
right
to
ask
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
sorry
you
asked
it
,
"
she
said
,
"
<EOS>
for
it
enables
me
to
do
justice
to
Sir
Percival
's
reputation
.
<EOS>
Not
a
whisper
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
has
ever
reached
me
,
or
my
family
,
against
him
.
<EOS>
He
has
fought
successfully
two
contested
elections
,
and
has
come
out
of
the
ordeal
unscathed
.
<EOS>
A
man
who
can
do
that
,
in
England
,
is
a
man
whose
character
is
established
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
opened
the
door
for
her
in
silence
,
and
followed
her
out
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
convinced
me
.
<EOS>
If
the
recording
angel
had
come
down
from
heaven
to
confirm
her
,
and
had
opened
his
book
to
my
mortal
eyes
,
the
recording
angel
would
not
have
convinced
me
.
  
<EOS>
We
found
the
gardener
at
work
as
usual
.
<EOS>
No
amount
of
questioning
could
extract
a
single
answer
of
any
importance
from
the
lad
's
impenetrable
stupidity
.
<EOS>
The
woman
who
had
given
him
the
letter
was
an
elderly
woman
;
she
had
not
spoken
a
word
to
him
,
and
she
had
gone
away
towards
the
south
in
a
great
hurry
.
<EOS>
That
was
all
the
gardener
could
tell
us
.
  
<EOS>
The
village
lay
southward
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
So
to
the
village
we
went
next
.
    
<EOS>
Our
inquiries
at
Limmeridge
were
patiently
pursued
in
all
directions
,
and
among
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
people
.
<EOS>
But
nothing
came
of
them
.
<EOS>
Three
of
the
villagers
did
certainly
assure
us
that
they
had
seen
the
woman
,
but
as
they
were
quite
unable
to
describe
her
,
and
quite
incapable
of
agreeing
about
the
exact
direction
in
which
she
was
proceeding
when
they
last
saw
her
,
these
three
bright
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
of
total
ignorance
afforded
no
more
real
assistance
to
us
than
the
mass
of
their
unhelpful
and
unobservant
neighbours
.
  
<EOS>
The
course
of
our
useless
investigations
brought
us
,
in
time
,
to
the
end
of
the
village
at
which
the
schools
established
by
Mrs.
Fairlie
were
situated
.
<EOS>
As
we
passed
the
side
of
the
building
appropriated
to
the
use
of
the
boys
,
I
suggested
the
propriety
of
making
a
last
inquiry
of
the
schoolmaster
,
whom
we
might
presume
to
be
,
in
virtue
of
his
office
,
the
most
intelligent
man
in
the
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
the
schoolmaster
must
have
been
occupied
with
his
scholars
,
"
said
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
just
at
the
time
when
the
woman
passed
through
the
village
and
returned
again
.
<EOS>
However
,
we
can
but
try
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
entered
the
playground
enclosure
,
and
walked
by
the
schoolroom
window
to
get
round
to
the
door
,
which
was
situated
at
the
back
of
the
building
.
<EOS>
I
stopped
for
a
moment
at
the
window
and
looked
in
.
  
<EOS>
The
schoolmaster
was
sitting
at
his
high
desk
,
with
his
back
to
me
,
apparently
haranguing
the
pupils
,
who
were
all
gathered
together
in
front
of
him
,
with
one
exception
.
<EOS>
The
one
exception
was
a
sturdy
white
-
headed
boy
,
standing
apart
from
all
the
rest
on
a
stool
in
a
corner
 
<EOS>
a
forlorn
little
Crusoe
,
isolated
in
his
own
desert
island
of
solitary
penal
disgrace
.
  
<EOS>
The
door
,
when
we
got
round
to
it
,
was
ajar
,
and
the
school
-
master
's
voice
reached
us
plainly
,
as
we
both
stopped
for
a
minute
under
the
porch
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
boys
,
"
said
the
voice
,
"
mind
what
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
If
I
hear
another
word
spoken
about
ghosts
in
this
school
,
it
will
be
the
worse
for
all
of
you
.
<EOS>
There
are
no
such
things
as
ghosts
,
and
therefore
any
boy
who
believes
in
ghosts
believes
in
what
ca
n't
possibly
be
;
and
a
boy
who
belongs
to
Limmeridge
School
,
and
believes
in
what
ca
n't
possibly
be
,
sets
up
his
back
against
reason
and
discipline
,
and
must
be
punished
accordingly
.
<EOS>
You
all
see
Jacob
Postlethwaite
standing
up
on
the
stool
there
in
disgrace
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
punished
,
not
because
he
said
he
saw
a
ghost
last
night
,
but
because
he
is
too
impudent
and
too
obstinate
to
listen
to
reason
,
and
because
he
persists
in
saying
he
saw
the
ghost
after
I
have
told
him
that
no
such
thing
can
possibly
be
.
<EOS>
If
nothing
else
will
do
,
I
mean
to
cane
the
ghost
out
of
Jacob
Postlethwaite
,
and
if
the
thing
spreads
among
any
of
the
rest
of
you
,
I
mean
to
go
a
step
farther
,
and
cane
the
ghost
out
of
the
whole
school
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
seem
to
have
chosen
an
awkward
moment
for
our
visit
,
"
said
Miss
Halcombe
,
pushing
open
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
schoolmaster
's
address
,
and
leading
the
way
in
.
  
<EOS>
Our
appearance
produced
a
strong
sensation
among
the
boys
.
<EOS>
They
appeared
to
think
that
we
had
arrived
for
the
express
purpose
of
seeing
Jacob
Postlethwaite
caned
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
home
all
of
you
to
dinner
,
"
said
the
schoolmaster
,
"
except
Jacob
.
<EOS>
Jacob
must
stop
where
he
is
;
and
the
ghost
may
bring
him
his
dinner
,
if
the
ghost
pleases
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Jacob
's
fortitude
deserted
him
at
the
double
disappearance
of
his
schoolfellows
and
his
prospect
of
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
took
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
,
looked
hard
at
his
knuckles
,
raised
them
with
great
deliberation
to
his
eyes
,
and
when
they
got
there
,
ground
them
round
and
round
slowly
,
accompanying
the
action
by
short
spasms
of
sniffing
,
which
followed
each
other
at
regular
intervals
 
the
nasal
minute
guns
of
juvenile
distress
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
came
here
to
ask
you
a
question
,
Mr.
Dempster
,
"
said
Miss
Halcombe
,
addressing
the
schoolmaster
;
"
and
we
little
expected
to
find
you
occupied
in
exorcising
a
ghost
.
<EOS>
What
does
it
all
mean
?
<EOS>
What
has
really
happened
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
wicked
boy
has
been
frightening
the
whole
school
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
by
declaring
that
he
saw
a
ghost
yesterday
evening
,
"
answered
the
master
;
"
and
he
still
persists
in
his
absurd
story
,
in
spite
of
all
that
I
can
say
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Most
extraordinary
,
"
said
Miss
Halcombe
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
have
thought
it
possible
that
any
of
the
boys
had
imagination
enough
to
see
a
ghost
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
new
accession
indeed
to
the
hard
labour
of
forming
the
youthful
mind
at
Limmeridge
,
and
I
heartily
wish
you
well
through
it
,
Mr.
Dempster
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
let
me
explain
why
you
see
me
here
,
and
what
it
is
I
want
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
then
put
the
same
question
to
the
schoolmaster
which
we
had
asked
already
of
almost
every
one
else
in
the
village
.
<EOS>
It
was
met
by
the
same
discouraging
answer
Mr.
Dempster
had
not
set
eyes
on
the
stranger
of
whom
we
were
in
search
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
may
as
well
return
to
the
house
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
"
said
Miss
Halcombe
;
"
the
information
we
want
is
evidently
not
to
be
found
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
bowed
to
Mr.
Dempster
,
and
was
about
to
leave
the
schoolroom
,
when
the
forlorn
position
of
Jacob
Postlethwaite
,
piteously
sniffing
on
the
stool
of
penitence
,
attracted
her
attention
as
she
passed
him
,
and
made
her
stop
good
-
humouredly
to
speak
a
word
to
the
little
prisoner
before
she
opened
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
foolish
boy
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
,
"
why
do
n't
you
beg
Mr.
Dempster
's
pardon
,
and
hold
your
tongue
about
the
ghost
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Eh
!
 
<EOS>
but
I
saw
t
'
ghaist
,
"
persisted
Jacob
Postlethwaite
,
with
a
stare
of
terror
and
a
burst
of
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stuff
and
nonsense
!
<EOS>
You
saw
nothing
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
Ghost
indeed
!
<EOS>
What
ghost
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
interposed
the
schoolmaster
a
little
uneasily
 
"
but
I
think
you
had
better
not
question
the
boy
.
<EOS>
The
obstinate
folly
of
his
story
is
beyond
all
belief
;
and
you
might
lead
him
into
ignorantly
 
"
  
"
Ignorantly
what
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Miss
Halcombe
sharply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ignorantly
shocking
your
feelings
,
"
said
Mr.
Dempster
,
looking
very
much
discomposed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
Mr.
Dempster
,
you
pay
my
feelings
a
great
compliment
in
thinking
them
weak
enough
to
be
shocked
by
such
an
urchin
as
that
!
"
<EOS>
She
turned
with
an
air
of
satirical
defiance
to
little
Jacob
,
and
began
to
question
him
directly
.
"
<EOS>
Come
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
I
mean
to
know
all
about
this
.
<EOS>
You
naughty
boy
,
when
did
you
see
the
ghost
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yestere'en
,
at
the
gloaming
,
"
replied
Jacob
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
you
saw
it
yesterday
evening
,
in
the
twilight
?
<EOS>
And
what
was
it
like
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Arl
in
white
 
as
a
ghaist
should
be
,
"
answered
the
ghost
-
seer
,
with
a
confidence
beyond
his
years
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
where
was
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Away
yander
,
in
t
'
kirkyard
 
where
a
ghaist
ought
to
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
a
"
ghaist
'
should
be
 
where
a
"
ghaist
'
ought
to
be
 
<EOS>
why
,
you
little
fool
,
you
talk
as
if
the
manners
and
customs
of
ghosts
had
been
familiar
to
you
from
your
infancy
!
<EOS>
You
have
got
your
story
at
your
fingers
'
ends
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
shall
hear
next
that
you
can
actually
tell
me
whose
ghost
it
was
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Eh
!
<EOS>
but
I
just
can
,
"
replied
Jacob
,
nodding
his
head
with
an
air
of
gloomy
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Dempster
had
already
tried
several
times
to
speak
while
Miss
Halcombe
was
examining
his
pupil
,
and
he
now
interposed
resolutely
enough
to
make
himself
heard
.
  
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
he
said
,
"
if
I
venture
to
say
that
you
are
only
encouraging
the
boy
by
asking
him
these
questions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
merely
ask
one
more
,
Mr.
Dempster
,
and
then
I
shall
be
quite
satisfied
.
<EOS>
Well
,
"
she
continued
,
turning
to
the
boy
,
"
and
whose
ghost
was
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
T
'
ghaist
of
Mistress
Fairlie
,
"
answered
Jacob
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
The
effect
which
this
extraordinary
reply
produced
on
Miss
Halcombe
fully
justified
the
anxiety
which
the
schoolmaster
had
shown
to
prevent
her
from
hearing
it
.
<EOS>
Her
face
crimsoned
with
indignation
 
<EOS>
she
turned
upon
little
Jacob
with
an
angry
suddenness
which
terrified
him
into
a
fresh
burst
of
tears
 
<EOS>
opened
her
lips
to
speak
to
him
 
then
controlled
herself
,
and
addressed
the
master
instead
of
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
useless
,
"
she
said
,
"
to
hold
such
a
child
as
that
responsible
for
what
he
says
.
<EOS>
I
have
little
doubt
that
the
idea
has
been
put
into
his
head
by
others
.
<EOS>
If
there
are
people
in
this
village
,
Mr.
Dempster
,
who
have
forgotten
the
respect
and
gratitude
due
from
every
soul
in
it
to
my
mother
's
memory
,
I
will
find
them
out
,
and
if
I
have
any
influence
with
Mr.
Fairlie
,
they
shall
suffer
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
 
indeed
,
I
am
sure
,
Miss
Halcombe
 
<EOS>
that
you
are
mistaken
,
"
said
the
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
"
The
matter
begins
and
ends
with
the
boy
's
own
perversity
and
folly
.
<EOS>
He
saw
,
or
thought
he
saw
,
a
woman
in
white
,
yesterday
evening
,
as
he
was
passing
the
churchyard
;
and
the
figure
,
real
or
fancied
,
was
standing
by
the
marble
cross
,
which
he
and
every
one
else
in
Limmeridge
knows
to
be
the
monument
over
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
grave
.
<EOS>
These
two
circumstances
are
surely
sufficient
to
have
suggested
to
the
boy
himself
the
answer
which
has
so
naturally
shocked
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Although
Miss
Halcombe
did
not
seem
to
be
convinced
,
she
evidently
felt
that
the
schoolmaster
's
statement
of
the
case
was
too
sensible
to
be
openly
combated
.
<EOS>
She
merely
replied
by
thanking
him
for
his
attention
,
and
by
promising
to
see
him
again
when
her
doubts
were
satisfied
.
<EOS>
This
said
,
she
bowed
,
and
led
the
way
out
of
the
schoolroom
.
  
<EOS>
Throughout
the
whole
of
this
strange
scene
I
had
stood
apart
,
listening
attentively
,
and
drawing
my
own
conclusions
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
we
were
alone
again
,
Miss
Halcombe
asked
me
if
I
had
formed
any
opinion
on
what
I
had
heard
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
strong
opinion
,
"
I
answered
;
"
the
boy
's
story
,
as
I
believe
,
has
a
foundation
in
fact
.
<EOS>
I
confess
I
am
anxious
to
see
the
monument
over
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
grave
,
and
to
examine
the
ground
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
see
the
grave
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
paused
after
making
that
reply
,
and
reflected
a
little
as
we
walked
on
.
<EOS>
"
What
has
happened
in
the
schoolroom
,
"
she
resumed
,
"
has
so
completely
distracted
my
attention
from
the
subject
of
the
letter
,
that
I
feel
a
little
bewildered
when
I
try
to
return
to
it
.
<EOS>
Must
we
give
up
all
idea
of
making
any
further
inquiries
,
and
wait
to
place
the
thing
in
Mr.
Gilmore
's
hands
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
By
no
means
,
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
What
has
happened
in
the
schoolroom
encourages
me
to
persevere
in
the
investigation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
does
it
encourage
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
it
strengthens
a
suspicion
I
felt
when
you
gave
me
the
letter
to
read
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
had
your
reasons
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
for
concealing
that
suspicion
from
me
till
this
moment
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
afraid
to
encourage
it
in
myself
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
utterly
preposterous
 
<EOS>
I
distrusted
it
as
the
result
of
some
perversity
in
my
own
imagination
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
do
so
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Not
only
the
boy
's
own
answers
to
your
questions
,
but
even
a
chance
expression
that
dropped
from
the
schoolmaster
's
lips
in
explaining
his
story
,
have
forced
the
idea
back
into
my
mind
.
<EOS>
Events
may
yet
prove
that
idea
to
be
a
delusion
,
Miss
Halcombe
;
but
the
belief
is
strong
in
me
,
at
this
moment
,
that
the
fancied
ghost
in
the
churchyard
,
and
the
writer
of
the
anonymous
letter
,
are
one
and
the
same
person
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
stopped
,
turned
pale
,
and
looked
me
eagerly
in
the
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
person
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
schoolmaster
unconsciously
told
you
.
<EOS>
When
he
spoke
of
the
figure
that
the
boy
saw
in
the
churchyard
he
called
it
"
a
woman
in
white
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
Anne
Catherick
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Anne
Catherick
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
put
her
hand
through
my
arm
and
leaned
on
it
heavily
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
why
,
"
she
said
in
low
tones
,
"
but
there
is
something
in
this
suspicion
of
yours
that
seems
to
startle
and
unnerve
me
.
<EOS>
I
feel
 
"
She
stopped
,
and
tried
to
laugh
it
off
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Hartright
,
"
she
went
on
,
"
I
will
show
you
the
grave
,
and
then
go
back
at
once
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
had
better
not
leave
Laura
too
long
alone
.
<EOS>
I
had
better
go
back
and
sit
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
were
close
to
the
churchyard
when
she
spoke
.
<EOS>
The
church
,
a
dreary
building
of
grey
stone
,
was
situated
in
a
little
valley
,
so
as
to
be
sheltered
from
the
bleak
winds
blowing
over
the
moorland
all
round
it
.
<EOS>
The
burial
-
ground
advanced
,
from
the
side
of
the
church
,
a
little
way
up
the
slope
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
It
was
surrounded
by
a
rough
,
low
stone
wall
,
and
was
bare
and
open
to
the
sky
,
except
at
one
extremity
,
where
a
brook
trickled
down
the
stony
hill
-
side
,
and
a
clump
of
dwarf
trees
threw
their
narrow
shadows
over
the
short
,
meagre
grass
.
<EOS>
Just
beyond
the
brook
and
the
trees
,
and
not
far
from
one
of
the
three
stone
stiles
which
afforded
entrance
,
at
various
points
,
to
the
churchyard
,
rose
the
white
marble
cross
that
distinguished
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
grave
from
the
humbler
monuments
scattered
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
need
go
no
farther
with
you
,
"
said
Miss
Halcombe
,
pointing
to
the
grave
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
let
me
know
if
you
find
anything
to
confirm
the
idea
you
have
just
mentioned
to
me
.
<EOS>
Let
us
meet
again
at
the
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
left
me
.
<EOS>
I
descended
at
once
to
the
churchyard
,
and
crossed
the
stile
which
led
directly
to
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
grave
.
  
<EOS>
The
grass
about
it
was
too
short
,
and
the
ground
too
hard
,
to
show
any
marks
of
footsteps
.
<EOS>
Disappointed
thus
far
,
I
next
looked
attentively
at
the
cross
,
and
at
the
square
block
of
marble
below
it
,
on
which
the
inscription
was
cut
.
  
<EOS>
The
natural
whiteness
of
the
cross
was
a
little
clouded
,
here
and
there
,
by
weather
stains
,
and
rather
more
than
one
half
of
the
square
block
beneath
it
,
on
the
side
which
bore
the
inscription
,
was
in
the
same
condition
.
<EOS>
The
other
half
,
however
,
attracted
my
attention
at
once
by
its
singular
freedom
from
stain
or
impurity
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
I
looked
closer
,
and
saw
that
it
had
been
cleaned
 
recently
cleaned
,
in
a
downward
direction
from
top
to
bottom
.
<EOS>
The
boundary
line
between
the
part
that
had
been
cleaned
and
the
part
that
had
not
was
traceable
wherever
the
inscription
left
a
blank
space
of
marble
 
sharply
traceable
as
a
line
that
had
been
produced
by
artificial
means
.
<EOS>
Who
had
begun
the
cleansing
of
the
marble
,
and
who
had
left
it
unfinished
?
  
<EOS>
I
looked
about
me
,
wondering
how
the
question
was
to
be
solved
.
<EOS>
No
sign
of
a
habitation
could
be
discerned
from
the
point
at
which
I
was
standing
 
the
burial
-
ground
was
left
in
the
lonely
possession
of
the
dead
.
<EOS>
I
returned
to
the
church
,
and
walked
round
it
till
I
came
to
the
back
of
the
building
;
then
crossed
the
boundary
wall
beyond
,
by
another
of
the
stone
stiles
,
and
found
myself
at
the
head
of
a
path
leading
down
into
a
deserted
stone
quarry
.
<EOS>
Against
one
side
of
the
quarry
a
little
two
-
room
cottage
was
built
,
and
just
outside
the
door
an
old
woman
was
engaged
in
washing
.
  
<EOS>
I
walked
up
to
her
,
and
entered
into
conversation
about
the
church
and
burial
-
ground
.
<EOS>
She
was
ready
enough
to
talk
,
and
almost
the
first
words
she
said
informed
me
that
her
husband
filled
the
two
offices
of
clerk
and
sexton
.
<EOS>
I
said
a
few
words
next
in
praise
of
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
monument
.
<EOS>
The
old
woman
shook
her
head
,
and
told
me
I
had
not
seen
it
at
its
best
.
<EOS>
It
was
her
husband
's
business
to
look
after
it
,
but
he
had
been
so
ailing
and
weak
for
months
and
months
past
,
that
he
had
hardly
been
able
to
crawl
into
church
on
Sundays
to
do
his
duty
,
and
the
monument
had
been
neglected
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
He
was
getting
a
little
better
now
,
and
in
a
week
or
ten
days
'
time
he
hoped
to
be
strong
enough
to
set
to
work
and
clean
it
.
  
<EOS>
This
information
 
extracted
from
a
long
rambling
answer
in
the
broadest
Cumberland
<EOS>
dialect
 
told
me
all
that
I
most
wanted
to
know
.
<EOS>
I
gave
the
poor
woman
a
trifle
,
and
returned
at
once
to
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
The
partial
cleansing
of
the
monument
had
evidently
been
accomplished
by
a
strange
hand
.
<EOS>
Connecting
what
I
had
discovered
,
thus
far
,
with
what
I
had
suspected
after
hearing
the
story
of
the
ghost
seen
at
twilight
,
I
wanted
nothing
more
to
confirm
my
resolution
to
watch
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
grave
,
in
secret
,
that
evening
,
returning
to
it
at
sunset
,
and
waiting
within
sight
of
it
till
the
night
fell
.
<EOS>
The
work
of
cleansing
the
monument
had
been
left
unfinished
,
and
the
person
by
whom
it
had
been
begun
might
return
to
complete
it
.
  
<EOS>
On
getting
back
to
the
house
I
informed
Miss
Halcombe
of
what
I
intended
to
do
.
<EOS>
She
looked
surprised
and
uneasy
while
I
was
explaining
my
purpose
,
but
she
made
no
positive
objection
to
the
execution
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
only
said
,
"
I
hope
it
may
end
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
Just
as
she
was
leaving
me
again
,
I
stopped
her
to
inquire
,
as
calmly
as
I
could
,
after
Miss
Fairlie
's
health
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
better
spirits
,
and
Miss
Halcombe
hoped
she
might
be
induced
to
take
a
little
walking
exercise
while
the
afternoon
sun
lasted
.
  
<EOS>
I
returned
to
my
own
room
to
resume
setting
the
drawings
in
order
.
<EOS>
It
was
necessary
to
do
this
,
and
doubly
necessary
to
keep
my
mind
employed
on
anything
that
would
help
to
distract
my
attention
from
myself
,
and
from
the
hopeless
future
that
lay
before
me
.
<EOS>
From
time
to
time
I
paused
in
my
work
to
look
out
of
window
and
watch
the
sky
as
the
sun
sank
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
horizon
.
<EOS>
On
one
of
those
occasions
I
saw
a
figure
on
the
broad
gravel
walk
under
my
window
.
<EOS>
It
was
Miss
Fairlie
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
not
seen
her
since
the
morning
,
and
I
had
hardly
spoken
to
her
then
.
<EOS>
Another
day
at
Limmeridge
was
all
that
remained
to
me
,
and
after
that
day
my
eyes
might
never
look
on
her
again
.
<EOS>
This
thought
was
enough
to
hold
me
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
I
had
sufficient
consideration
for
her
to
arrange
the
blind
so
that
she
might
not
see
me
if
she
looked
up
,
but
I
had
no
strength
to
resist
the
temptation
of
letting
my
eyes
,
at
least
,
follow
her
as
far
as
they
could
on
her
walk
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
dressed
in
a
brown
cloak
,
with
a
plain
black
silk
gown
under
it
.
<EOS>
On
her
head
was
the
same
simple
straw
hat
which
she
had
worn
on
the
morning
when
we
first
met
.
<EOS>
A
veil
was
attached
to
it
now
which
hid
her
face
from
me
.
<EOS>
By
her
side
trotted
a
little
Italian
greyhound
,
the
pet
companion
of
all
her
walks
,
smartly
dressed
in
a
scarlet
cloth
wrapper
,
to
keep
the
sharp
air
from
his
delicate
skin
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
seem
to
notice
the
dog
.
<EOS>
She
walked
straight
forward
,
with
her
head
drooping
a
little
,
and
her
arms
folded
in
her
cloak
.
<EOS>
The
dead
leaves
,
which
had
whirled
in
the
wind
before
me
when
I
had
heard
of
her
marriage
engagement
in
the
morning
,
whirled
in
the
wind
before
her
,
and
rose
and
fell
and
scattered
themselves
at
her
feet
as
she
walked
on
in
the
pale
waning
sunlight
.
<EOS>
The
dog
shivered
and
trembled
,
and
pressed
against
her
dress
impatiently
for
notice
and
encouragement
.
<EOS>
But
she
never
heeded
him
.
<EOS>
She
walked
on
,
farther
and
farther
away
from
me
,
with
the
dead
leaves
whirling
about
her
on
the
path
 
walked
on
,
till
my
aching
eyes
could
see
her
no
more
,
and
I
was
left
alone
again
with
my
own
heavy
heart
.
  
<EOS>
In
another
hour
's
time
I
had
done
my
work
,
and
the
sunset
was
at
hand
.
<EOS>
I
got
my
hat
and
coat
in
the
hall
,
and
slipped
out
of
the
house
without
meeting
any
one
.
  
<EOS>
The
clouds
were
wild
in
the
western
heaven
,
and
the
wind
blew
chill
from
the
sea
.
<EOS>
Far
as
the
shore
was
,
the
sound
of
the
surf
swept
over
the
intervening
moorland
,
and
beat
drearily
in
my
ears
when
I
entered
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
Not
a
living
creature
was
in
sight
.
<EOS>
The
place
looked
lonelier
than
ever
as
I
chose
my
position
,
and
waited
and
watched
,
with
my
eyes
on
the
white
cross
that
rose
over
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
grave
.
    
<EOS>
The
exposed
situation
of
the
churchyard
had
obliged
me
to
be
cautious
in
choosing
the
position
that
I
was
to
occupy
.
  
<EOS>
The
main
entrance
to
the
church
was
on
the
side
next
to
the
burial
-
ground
,
and
the
door
was
screened
by
a
porch
walled
in
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
After
some
little
hesitation
,
caused
by
natural
reluctance
to
conceal
myself
,
indispensable
as
that
concealment
was
to
the
object
in
view
,
I
had
resolved
on
entering
the
porch
.
<EOS>
A
loophole
window
was
pierced
in
each
of
its
side
walls
.
<EOS>
Through
one
of
these
windows
I
could
see
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
grave
.
<EOS>
The
other
looked
towards
the
stone
quarry
in
which
the
sexton
's
cottage
was
built
.
<EOS>
Before
me
,
fronting
the
porch
entrance
,
was
a
patch
of
bare
burial
-
ground
,
a
line
of
low
stone
wall
,
and
a
strip
of
lonely
brown
hill
,
with
the
sunset
clouds
sailing
heavily
over
it
before
the
strong
,
steady
wind
.
<EOS>
No
living
creature
was
visible
or
audible
 
<EOS>
no
bird
flew
by
me
,
no
dog
barked
from
the
sexton
's
cottage
.
<EOS>
The
pauses
in
the
dull
beating
of
the
surf
were
filled
up
by
the
dreary
rustling
of
the
dwarf
trees
near
the
grave
,
and
the
cold
faint
bubble
of
the
brook
over
its
stony
bed
.
<EOS>
A
dreary
scene
and
a
dreary
hour
.
<EOS>
My
spirits
sank
fast
as
I
counted
out
the
minutes
of
the
evening
in
my
hiding
-
place
under
the
church
porch
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
twilight
yet
 
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
still
lingered
in
the
heavens
,
and
little
more
than
the
first
half
-
hour
of
my
solitary
watch
had
elapsed
 
when
I
heard
footsteps
and
a
voice
.
<EOS>
The
footsteps
were
approaching
from
the
other
side
of
the
church
,
and
the
voice
was
a
woman
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
fret
,
my
dear
,
about
the
letter
,
"
said
the
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
gave
it
to
the
lad
quite
safe
,
and
the
lad
he
took
it
from
me
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
He
went
his
way
<EOS>
and
I
went
mine
,
and
not
a
living
soul
followed
me
afterwards
 
that
I
'll
warrant
.
"
  
<EOS>
These
words
strung
up
my
attention
to
a
pitch
of
expectation
that
was
almost
painful
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
pause
of
silence
,
but
the
footsteps
still
advanced
.
<EOS>
In
another
moment
two
persons
,
both
women
,
passed
within
my
range
of
view
from
the
porch
window
.
<EOS>
They
were
walking
straight
towards
the
grave
;
and
therefore
they
had
their
backs
turned
towards
me
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
the
women
was
dressed
in
a
bonnet
and
shawl
.
<EOS>
The
other
wore
a
long
travelling
-
cloak
of
a
dark
-
blue
colour
,
with
the
hood
drawn
over
her
head
.
<EOS>
A
few
inches
of
her
gown
were
visible
below
the
cloak
.
<EOS>
My
heart
beat
fast
as
I
noted
the
colour
 
<EOS>
it
was
white
.
  
<EOS>
After
advancing
about
half
-
way
between
the
church
and
the
grave
they
stopped
,
and
the
woman
in
the
cloak
turned
her
head
towards
her
companion
.
<EOS>
But
her
side
face
,
which
a
bonnet
might
now
have
allowed
me
to
see
,
was
hidden
by
the
heavy
,
projecting
edge
of
the
hood
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mind
you
keep
that
comfortable
warm
cloak
on
,
"
said
the
same
voice
which
I
had
already
heard
 
the
voice
of
the
woman
in
the
shawl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Todd
is
right
about
your
looking
too
particular
,
yesterday
,
all
in
white
.
<EOS>
I
'll
walk
about
a
little
while
you
're
here
,
churchyards
being
not
at
all
in
my
way
,
whatever
they
may
be
in
yours
.
<EOS>
Finish
what
you
want
to
do
before
I
come
back
,
and
let
us
be
sure
and
get
home
again
before
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
With
those
words
she
turned
about
,
and
retracing
her
steps
,
advanced
with
her
face
towards
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
face
of
an
elderly
woman
,
brown
,
rugged
,
and
healthy
,
with
nothing
dishonest
or
suspicious
in
the
look
of
it
.
<EOS>
Close
to
the
church
she
stopped
to
pull
her
shawl
closer
round
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Queer
,
"
she
said
to
herself
,
"
always
queer
,
with
her
whims
and
her
ways
,
ever
since
I
can
remember
her
.
<EOS>
Harmless
,
though
 
as
harmless
,
poor
soul
,
as
a
little
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
sighed
 
looked
about
the
burial
-
ground
<EOS>
nervously
 
shook
her
head
,
as
if
the
dreary
prospect
by
no
means
pleased
her
,
and
disappeared
round
the
corner
of
the
church
.
  
<EOS>
I
doubted
for
a
moment
whether
I
ought
to
follow
and
speak
to
her
or
not
.
<EOS>
My
intense
anxiety
to
find
myself
face
to
face
with
her
companion
helped
me
to
decide
in
the
negative
.
<EOS>
I
could
ensure
seeing
the
woman
in
the
shawl
by
waiting
near
the
churchyard
until
she
came
back
 
although
it
seemed
more
than
doubtful
whether
she
could
give
me
the
information
of
which
I
was
in
search
.
<EOS>
The
person
who
had
delivered
the
letter
was
of
little
consequence
.
<EOS>
The
person
who
had
written
it
was
the
one
centre
of
interest
,
and
the
one
source
of
information
,
and
that
person
I
now
felt
convinced
was
before
me
in
the
churchyard
.
  
<EOS>
While
these
ideas
were
passing
through
my
mind
<EOS>
I
saw
the
woman
in
the
cloak
approach
close
to
the
grave
,
and
stand
looking
at
it
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
She
then
glanced
all
round
her
,
and
taking
a
white
linen
cloth
or
handkerchief
from
under
her
cloak
,
turned
aside
towards
the
brook
.
<EOS>
The
little
stream
ran
into
the
churchyard
under
a
tiny
archway
in
the
bottom
of
the
wall
,
and
ran
out
again
,
after
a
winding
course
of
a
few
dozen
yards
,
under
a
similar
opening
.
<EOS>
She
dipped
the
cloth
in
the
water
,
and
returned
to
the
grave
.
<EOS>
I
saw
her
kiss
the
white
cross
,
then
kneel
down
before
the
inscription
,
and
apply
her
wet
cloth
to
the
cleansing
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
After
considering
how
I
could
show
myself
with
the
least
possible
chance
of
frightening
her
,
I
resolved
to
cross
the
wall
before
me
,
to
skirt
round
it
outside
,
and
to
enter
the
churchyard
again
by
the
stile
near
the
grave
,
in
order
that
she
might
see
me
as
I
approached
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
absorbed
over
her
employment
that
she
did
not
hear
me
coming
until
I
had
stepped
over
the
stile
.
<EOS>
Then
she
looked
up
,
started
to
her
feet
with
a
faint
cry
,
and
stood
facing
me
in
speechless
and
motionless
terror
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
frightened
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Surely
you
remember
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
stopped
while
I
spoke
 
then
advanced
a
few
steps
gently
 
then
stopped
again
 
and
so
approached
by
little
and
little
till
I
was
close
to
her
.
<EOS>
If
there
had
been
any
doubt
still
left
in
my
mind
,
it
must
have
been
now
set
at
rest
.
<EOS>
There
,
speaking
affrightedly
for
itself
 
there
was
the
same
face
confronting
me
over
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
grave
which
had
first
looked
into
mine
on
the
high
-
road
by
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
remember
me
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
We
met
very
late
,
and
I
helped
you
to
find
the
way
to
London
.
<EOS>
Surely
you
have
not
forgotten
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
features
relaxed
,
and
she
drew
a
heavy
breath
of
relief
.
<EOS>
I
saw
the
new
life
of
recognition
stirring
slowly
under
the
death
-
like
stillness
which
fear
had
set
on
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
attempt
to
speak
to
me
just
yet
,
"
I
went
on
.
"
<EOS>
Take
time
to
recover
yourself
 
take
time
to
feel
quite
certain
that
I
am
a
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
kind
to
me
,
"
she
murmured
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
kind
now
as
you
were
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
stopped
,
and
I
kept
silence
on
my
side
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
granting
time
for
composure
to
her
only
,
I
was
gaining
time
also
for
myself
.
<EOS>
Under
the
wan
wild
evening
light
,
that
woman
and
I
were
met
together
again
,
a
grave
between
us
,
the
dead
about
us
,
the
lonesome
hills
closing
us
round
on
every
side
.
<EOS>
The
time
,
the
place
,
the
circumstances
under
which
we
now
stood
face
to
face
in
the
evening
stillness
of
that
dreary
valley
 
the
lifelong
interests
which
might
hang
suspended
on
the
next
chance
words
that
passed
between
us
 
the
sense
that
,
for
aught
I
knew
to
the
contrary
,
the
whole
future
of
Laura
Fairlie
's
life
might
be
determined
,
for
good
or
for
evil
,
by
my
winning
or
losing
the
confidence
of
the
forlorn
creature
who
stood
trembling
by
her
mother
's
grave
 
all
<EOS>
threatened
to
shake
the
steadiness
and
the
self
-
control
on
which
every
inch
of
the
progress
I
might
yet
make
now
depended
.
<EOS>
I
tried
hard
,
as
I
felt
this
,
to
possess
myself
of
all
my
resources
;
I
did
my
utmost
to
turn
the
few
moments
for
reflection
to
the
best
account
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
calmer
now
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
as
soon
as
I
thought
it
time
to
speak
again
.
"
<EOS>
Can
you
talk
to
me
without
feeling
frightened
,
and
without
forgetting
that
I
am
a
friend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
did
you
come
here
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
without
noticing
what
I
had
just
said
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
remember
my
telling
you
,
<EOS>
when
we
last
met
,
that
I
was
going
to
Cumberland
?
<EOS>
I
have
been
in
Cumberland
ever
since
 
I
have
been
staying
all
the
time
at
Limmeridge
House
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
At
Limmeridge
House
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
pale
face
brightened
as
she
repeated
the
words
,
her
wandering
eyes
fixed
on
me
with
a
sudden
interest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
how
happy
you
must
have
been
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
looking
at
me
eagerly
,
without
a
shadow
of
its
former
distrust
left
in
her
expression
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
advantage
of
her
newly
-
aroused
confidence
in
me
to
observe
her
face
,
with
an
attention
and
a
curiosity
which
I
had
hitherto
restrained
myself
from
showing
,
for
caution
's
sake
.
<EOS>
I
looked
at
her
,
with
my
mind
full
of
that
other
lovely
face
which
had
so
ominously
recalled
her
to
my
memory
on
the
terrace
by
moonlight
.
<EOS>
I
had
seen
Anne
Catherick
's
likeness
in
Miss
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
I
now
saw
Miss
Fairlie
's
likeness
in
Anne
Catherick
 
saw
it
all
the
more
clearly
because
the
points
of
dissimilarity
between
the
two
were
presented
to
me
as
well
as
the
points
of
resemblance
.
<EOS>
In
the
general
outline
of
the
countenance
and
general
proportion
of
the
features
 
in
the
colour
of
the
hair
and
in
the
little
nervous
uncertainty
about
the
lips
 
in
the
height
and
size
of
the
figure
,
and
the
carriage
of
the
head
and
body
,
the
likeness
appeared
even
more
startling
than
I
had
ever
felt
it
to
be
yet
.
<EOS>
But
there
the
resemblance
ended
,
and
the
dissimilarity
,
in
details
,
began
.
<EOS>
The
delicate
beauty
of
Miss
Fairlie
's
complexion
,
the
transparent
clearness
of
her
eyes
,
the
smooth
purity
of
her
skin
,
the
tender
bloom
of
colour
on
her
lips
,
were
all
missing
from
the
worn
weary
face
that
was
now
turned
towards
mine
.
<EOS>
Although
I
hated
myself
even
for
thinking
such
a
thing
,
still
,
while
I
looked
at
the
woman
before
me
,
the
idea
would
force
itself
into
my
mind
that
one
sad
change
,
in
the
future
,
was
all
that
was
wanting
to
make
the
likeness
complete
,
which
I
now
saw
to
be
so
imperfect
in
detail
.
<EOS>
If
ever
sorrow
and
suffering
set
their
profaning
marks
on
the
youth
and
beauty
of
Miss
Fairlie
's
face
,
then
,
and
then
only
,
Anne
Catherick
and
she
would
be
the
twin
-
sisters
of
chance
resemblance
,
the
living
reflections
of
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
I
shuddered
at
the
thought
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
horrible
in
the
blind
unreasoning
distrust
of
the
future
which
the
mere
passage
of
it
through
my
mind
seemed
to
imply
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
welcome
interruption
to
be
roused
by
feeling
Anne
Catherick
's
hand
laid
on
my
shoulder
.
<EOS>
The
touch
was
as
stealthy
and
as
sudden
as
that
other
touch
which
had
petrified
me
from
head
to
foot
on
the
night
when
we
first
met
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
looking
at
me
,
and
you
are
thinking
of
something
,
"
she
said
,
with
her
strange
breathless
rapidity
of
utterance
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
extraordinary
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
only
wondering
how
you
came
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
came
with
a
friend
who
is
very
good
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
been
here
two
days
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
found
your
way
to
this
place
yesterday
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
guessed
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
turned
from
me
,
and
knelt
down
before
the
inscription
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
should
I
go
if
not
here
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
The
friend
who
was
better
than
a
mother
to
me
is
the
only
friend
I
have
to
visit
at
Limmeridge
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
it
makes
my
heart
ache
to
see
a
stain
on
her
tomb
!
<EOS>
It
ought
to
be
kept
white
as
snow
,
for
her
sake
.
<EOS>
I
was
tempted
to
begin
cleaning
it
yesterday
,
and
I
ca
n't
help
coming
back
to
go
on
with
it
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Is
there
anything
wrong
in
that
?
<EOS>
I
hope
not
.
<EOS>
Surely
nothing
can
be
wrong
that
I
do
for
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
sake
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
grateful
sense
of
her
benefactress
's
kindness
was
evidently
the
ruling
idea
still
in
the
poor
creature
's
mind
 
<EOS>
the
narrow
mind
which
had
but
too
plainly
opened
to
no
other
lasting
impression
since
that
first
impression
of
her
younger
and
happier
days
.
<EOS>
I
saw
that
my
best
chance
of
winning
her
confidence
lay
in
encouraging
her
to
proceed
with
the
artless
employment
which
she
had
come
into
the
burial
-
ground
to
pursue
.
<EOS>
She
resumed
it
at
once
,
on
my
telling
her
she
might
do
so
,
touching
the
hard
marble
as
tenderly
as
if
it
had
been
a
sentient
thing
,
and
whispering
the
words
of
the
inscription
to
herself
,
over
and
over
again
,
as
if
the
lost
days
of
her
girlhood
had
returned
and
she
was
patiently
learning
her
lesson
once
more
at
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
knees
.
  
<EOS>
"
Should
you
wonder
very
much
,
"
I
said
,
preparing
the
way
as
cautiously
as
I
could
for
the
questions
that
were
to
come
,
"
if
I
owned
that
it
is
a
satisfaction
to
me
,
as
well
as
a
surprise
,
to
see
you
here
?
<EOS>
I
felt
very
uneasy
about
you
after
you
left
me
in
the
cab
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
up
quickly
and
suspiciously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Uneasy
,
"
she
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
strange
thing
happened
after
we
parted
that
night
.
<EOS>
Two
men
overtook
me
in
a
chaise
.
<EOS>
They
did
not
see
where
I
was
standing
,
but
they
stopped
near
me
,
and
spoke
to
a
policeman
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
instantly
suspended
her
employment
.
<EOS>
The
hand
holding
the
damp
cloth
with
which
she
had
been
cleaning
the
inscription
dropped
to
her
side
.
<EOS>
The
other
hand
grasped
the
marble
cross
at
the
head
of
the
grave
.
<EOS>
Her
face
turned
towards
me
slowly
,
with
the
blank
look
of
terror
set
rigidly
on
it
once
more
.
<EOS>
I
went
on
at
all
<EOS>
hazards
 
<EOS>
it
was
too
late
now
to
draw
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
two
men
spoke
to
the
policeman
,
"
I
said
,
"
and
asked
him
if
he
had
seen
you
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
seen
you
;
and
then
one
of
the
men
spoke
again
,
and
said
you
had
escaped
from
his
Asylum
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
sprang
to
her
feet
as
if
my
last
words
had
set
the
pursuers
on
her
track
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
<EOS>
and
hear
the
end
,
"
I
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
<EOS>
and
you
shall
know
how
I
befriended
you
.
<EOS>
A
word
from
me
would
have
told
the
men
which
way
you
had
gone
 
<EOS>
and
I
never
spoke
that
word
.
<EOS>
I
helped
your
escape
 
<EOS>
I
made
it
safe
and
certain
.
<EOS>
Think
,
try
to
think
.
<EOS>
Try
to
understand
what
I
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
manner
seemed
to
influence
her
more
than
my
words
.
<EOS>
She
made
an
effort
to
grasp
the
new
idea
.
<EOS>
Her
hands
shifted
the
damp
cloth
hesitatingly
from
one
to
the
other
,
exactly
as
they
had
shifted
the
little
travelling
-
bag
on
the
night
when
I
first
saw
her
.
<EOS>
Slowly
the
purpose
of
my
words
seemed
to
force
its
way
through
the
confusion
and
agitation
of
her
mind
.
<EOS>
Slowly
her
features
relaxed
,
and
her
eyes
looked
at
me
with
their
expression
gaining
in
curiosity
what
it
was
fast
losing
in
fear
.
  
<EOS>
"
YOU
do
n't
think
I
ought
to
be
back
in
the
Asylum
,
do
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
.
<EOS>
I
am
glad
you
escaped
from
it
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
I
helped
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
you
did
help
me
indeed
;
you
helped
me
at
the
hard
part
,
"
she
went
on
a
little
vacantly
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
easy
to
escape
,
or
I
should
not
have
got
away
.
<EOS>
They
never
suspected
me
as
they
suspected
the
others
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
quiet
,
and
so
obedient
,
and
so
easily
frightened
.
<EOS>
The
finding
London
was
the
hard
part
,
and
there
you
helped
me
.
<EOS>
Did
I
thank
you
at
the
time
?
<EOS>
I
thank
you
now
very
kindly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
the
Asylum
far
from
where
you
met
me
?
<EOS>
Come
!
<EOS>
show
that
you
believe
me
to
be
your
friend
,
and
tell
me
where
it
was
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
mentioned
the
place
 
a
private
Asylum
,
as
its
situation
informed
me
;
a
private
Asylum
not
very
far
from
the
spot
where
I
had
seen
her
 
and
then
,
with
evident
suspicion
of
the
use
to
which
I
might
put
her
answer
,
anxiously
repeated
her
former
inquiry
,
"
You
do
n't
think
I
ought
to
be
taken
back
,
do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Once
again
,
I
am
glad
you
escaped
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
you
prospered
well
after
you
left
me
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
You
said
you
had
a
friend
in
London
to
go
to
.
<EOS>
Did
you
find
the
friend
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
late
,
but
there
was
a
girl
up
at
needle
-
work
in
the
house
,
and
she
helped
me
to
rouse
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
is
my
friend
.
<EOS>
A
good
,
kind
woman
,
but
not
like
Mrs.
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
Ah
no
,
nobody
is
like
Mrs.
Fairlie
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Mrs.
Clements
an
old
friend
of
yours
?
<EOS>
Have
you
known
her
a
long
time
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
she
was
a
neighbour
of
ours
once
,
at
home
,
in
Hampshire
,
and
liked
me
,
and
took
care
of
me
when
I
was
a
little
girl
.
<EOS>
Years
ago
,
when
she
went
away
from
us
,
she
wrote
down
in
my
Prayer
-
book
for
me
where
she
was
going
to
live
in
London
,
and
she
said
,
"
If
you
are
ever
in
trouble
,
Anne
,
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
husband
alive
to
say
me
nay
,
and
no
children
to
look
after
,
and
I
will
take
care
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Kind
words
,
were
they
not
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
remember
them
because
they
were
kind
.
<EOS>
It
's
little
enough
<EOS>
I
remember
besides
 
little
enough
,
little
enough
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Had
you
no
father
or
mother
to
take
care
of
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Father
?
 
<EOS>
I
never
saw
him
 
<EOS>
I
never
heard
mother
speak
of
him
.
<EOS>
Father
?
<EOS>
Ah
,
dear
!
<EOS>
he
is
dead
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
your
mother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
get
on
well
with
her
.
<EOS>
We
are
a
trouble
and
a
fear
to
each
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
trouble
and
a
fear
to
each
other
!
<EOS>
At
those
words
the
suspicion
crossed
my
mind
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
her
mother
might
be
the
person
who
had
placed
her
under
restraint
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
ask
me
about
mother
,
"
she
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
I
'd
rather
talk
of
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
is
like
you
,
she
does
n't
think
that
I
ought
to
be
back
in
the
Asylum
,
and
she
is
as
glad
as
you
are
that
I
escaped
from
it
.
<EOS>
She
cried
over
my
misfortune
,
and
said
it
must
be
kept
secret
from
everybody
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
"
misfortune
.
<EOS>
"
In
what
sense
was
she
using
that
word
?
<EOS>
In
a
sense
which
might
explain
her
motive
in
writing
the
anonymous
letter
?
<EOS>
In
a
sense
which
might
show
it
to
be
the
too
common
and
too
customary
motive
that
has
led
many
a
woman
to
interpose
anonymous
hindrances
to
the
marriage
of
the
man
who
has
ruined
her
?
<EOS>
I
resolved
to
attempt
the
clearing
up
of
this
doubt
before
more
words
passed
between
us
on
either
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
misfortune
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
misfortune
of
my
being
shut
up
,
"
she
answered
,
with
every
appearance
of
feeling
surprised
at
my
question
.
<EOS>
"
What
other
misfortune
could
there
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
determined
to
persist
,
as
delicately
and
forbearingly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
It
was
of
very
great
importance
that
I
should
be
absolutely
sure
of
every
step
in
the
investigation
which
I
now
gained
in
advance
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
another
misfortune
,
"
I
said
,
"
to
which
a
woman
may
be
liable
,
and
by
which
she
may
suffer
lifelong
sorrow
and
shame
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
misfortune
of
believing
too
innocently
in
her
own
virtue
,
and
in
the
faith
and
honour
of
the
man
she
loves
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
She
looked
up
at
me
with
the
artless
bewilderment
of
a
child
.
<EOS>
Not
the
slightest
confusion
or
change
of
colour
 
not
the
faintest
trace
of
any
secret
consciousness
of
shame
struggling
to
the
surface
appeared
in
her
face
 
that
face
which
betrayed
every
other
emotion
with
such
transparent
clearness
.
<EOS>
No
words
that
ever
were
spoken
could
have
assured
me
,
as
her
look
and
manner
now
assured
me
,
that
the
motive
which
I
had
assigned
for
her
writing
the
letter
and
sending
it
to
Miss
Fairlie
was
plainly
and
distinctly
the
wrong
one
.
<EOS>
That
doubt
,
at
any
rate
,
was
now
set
at
rest
;
but
the
very
removal
of
it
opened
a
new
prospect
of
uncertainty
.
<EOS>
The
letter
,
as
I
knew
from
positive
testimony
,
pointed
at
Sir
Percival
Glyde
,
though
it
did
not
name
him
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
had
some
strong
motive
,
originating
in
some
deep
sense
of
injury
,
for
secretly
denouncing
him
to
Miss
Fairlie
in
such
terms
as
she
had
employed
,
and
that
motive
was
unquestionably
not
to
be
traced
to
the
loss
of
her
innocence
and
her
character
.
<EOS>
Whatever
wrong
he
might
have
inflicted
on
her
was
not
of
that
nature
.
<EOS>
Of
what
nature
could
it
be
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
"
she
said
,
after
evidently
trying
hard
,
and
trying
in
vain
,
to
discover
the
meaning
of
the
words
I
had
last
said
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
go
on
with
what
we
were
talking
about
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
how
long
you
stayed
with
Mrs.
Clements
in
London
,
and
how
you
came
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
?
"
she
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
I
stayed
with
Mrs.
Clements
till
we
both
came
to
this
place
,
two
days
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
living
in
the
village
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
strange
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
heard
of
you
,
though
you
have
only
been
here
two
days
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
<EOS>
no
,
not
in
the
village
.
<EOS>
Three
miles
away
at
a
farm
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
the
farm
?
<EOS>
They
call
it
Todd
's
Corner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
remembered
the
place
perfectly
 
we
had
often
passed
by
it
in
our
drives
.
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
the
oldest
farms
in
the
neighbourhood
,
situated
in
a
solitary
,
sheltered
spot
,
<EOS>
inland
at
the
junction
of
two
hills
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
relations
of
Mrs.
Clements
at
Todd
's
Corner
,
"
she
went
on
,
"
and
they
had
often
asked
her
to
go
and
see
them
.
<EOS>
She
said
she
would
go
,
and
take
me
with
her
,
for
the
quiet
and
the
fresh
air
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
kind
,
was
it
not
?
<EOS>
I
would
have
gone
anywhere
to
be
quiet
,
and
safe
,
and
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
heard
that
Todd
's
Corner
was
near
Limmeridge
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
was
so
happy
I
would
have
walked
all
the
way
barefoot
to
get
there
,
and
see
the
schools
and
the
village
and
Limmeridge
House
again
.
<EOS>
They
are
very
good
people
at
Todd
's
Corner
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
stay
there
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
There
is
only
one
thing
I
do
n't
like
about
them
,
and
do
n't
like
about
Mrs.
Clements
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
What
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
will
tease
me
about
dressing
all
in
white
 
<EOS>
they
say
it
looks
so
particular
.
<EOS>
How
do
they
know
?
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairlie
knew
best
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairlie
would
never
have
made
me
wear
this
ugly
blue
cloak
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
she
was
fond
of
white
in
her
lifetime
,
and
here
is
white
stone
about
her
grave
 
<EOS>
and
I
am
making
it
whiter
for
her
sake
.
<EOS>
She
often
wore
white
herself
,
and
she
always
dressed
her
little
daughter
in
white
.
<EOS>
Is
Miss
Fairlie
well
and
happy
?
<EOS>
Does
she
wear
white
now
,
as
she
used
when
she
was
a
girl
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
voice
sank
when
she
put
the
questions
about
Miss
Fairlie
,
and
she
turned
her
head
farther
and
farther
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
detected
,
in
the
alteration
of
her
manner
,
an
uneasy
consciousness
of
the
risk
she
had
run
in
sending
the
anonymous
letter
,
and
I
instantly
determined
so
to
frame
my
answer
as
to
surprise
her
into
owning
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Fairlie
was
not
very
well
or
very
happy
this
morning
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
She
murmured
a
few
words
,
but
they
were
spoken
so
confusedly
,
and
in
such
a
low
tone
,
that
I
could
not
even
guess
at
what
they
meant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ask
me
why
Miss
Fairlie
was
neither
well
nor
happy
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
I
continued
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
said
quickly
and
eagerly
 
"
<EOS>
oh
no
,
I
never
asked
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
without
your
asking
,
"
I
went
on
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
has
received
your
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
been
down
on
her
knees
for
some
little
time
past
,
carefully
removing
the
last
weather
-
stains
left
about
the
inscription
while
we
were
speaking
together
.
<EOS>
The
first
sentence
of
the
words
I
had
just
addressed
to
her
made
her
pause
in
her
occupation
,
and
turn
slowly
without
rising
from
her
knees
,
so
as
to
face
me
.
<EOS>
The
second
sentence
literally
petrified
her
.
<EOS>
The
cloth
she
had
been
holding
dropped
from
her
hands
 
her
lips
fell
apart
 
all
the
little
colour
that
there
was
naturally
in
her
face
left
it
in
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
faintly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
showed
it
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
blood
rushed
back
into
her
face
 
rushed
overwhelmingly
,
as
the
sense
rushed
upon
her
mind
that
her
own
words
had
betrayed
her
.
<EOS>
She
struck
her
hands
together
in
despair
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
wrote
it
,
"
she
gasped
affrightedly
;
"
I
know
nothing
about
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
said
,
"
you
wrote
it
,
and
you
know
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
wrong
to
send
such
a
letter
,
it
was
wrong
to
frighten
Miss
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
anything
to
say
that
it
was
right
and
necessary
for
her
to
hear
,
you
should
have
gone
yourself
to
Limmeridge
House
 
<EOS>
you
should
have
spoken
to
the
young
lady
with
your
own
lips
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
crouched
down
over
the
flat
stone
of
the
grave
,
till
her
face
was
hidden
on
it
,
and
made
no
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Fairlie
will
be
as
good
and
kind
to
you
as
her
mother
was
,
if
you
mean
well
,
"
I
went
on
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
will
keep
your
secret
,
and
not
let
you
come
to
any
harm
.
<EOS>
Will
you
see
her
to
-
morrow
at
the
farm
?
<EOS>
Will
you
meet
her
in
the
garden
at
Limmeridge
House
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
if
I
could
die
,
and
be
hidden
and
at
rest
with
YOU
!
"
<EOS>
Her
lips
murmured
the
words
close
on
the
grave
-
stone
,
murmured
them
in
tones
of
passionate
endearment
,
to
the
dead
remains
beneath
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
how
I
love
your
child
,
for
your
sake
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mrs.
Fairlie
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairlie
!
<EOS>
tell
me
how
to
save
her
.
<EOS>
Be
my
darling
and
my
mother
once
more
,
and
tell
me
what
to
do
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
heard
her
lips
kissing
the
stone
 
<EOS>
I
saw
her
hands
beating
on
it
passionately
.
<EOS>
The
sound
and
the
sight
deeply
affected
me
.
<EOS>
I
stooped
down
,
and
took
the
poor
helpless
hands
tenderly
in
mine
,
and
tried
to
soothe
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
useless
.
<EOS>
She
snatched
her
hands
from
me
,
and
never
moved
her
face
from
the
stone
.
<EOS>
Seeing
the
urgent
necessity
of
quieting
her
at
any
hazard
and
by
any
means
,
I
appealed
to
the
only
anxiety
that
she
appeared
to
feel
,
in
connection
with
me
and
with
my
opinion
of
her
 
the
anxiety
to
convince
me
of
her
fitness
to
be
mistress
of
her
own
actions
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
"
I
said
gently
.
<EOS>
"
Try
to
compose
yourself
,
or
you
will
make
me
alter
my
opinion
of
you
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
me
think
that
the
person
who
put
you
in
the
Asylum
might
have
had
some
excuse
 
"
  
The
next
words
died
away
on
my
lips
.
<EOS>
The
instant
I
risked
that
chance
reference
to
the
person
who
had
put
her
in
the
Asylum
<EOS>
she
sprang
up
on
her
knees
.
<EOS>
A
most
extraordinary
and
startling
change
passed
over
her
.
<EOS>
Her
face
,
at
all
ordinary
times
so
touching
to
look
at
,
in
its
nervous
sensitiveness
,
weakness
,
and
uncertainty
,
became
suddenly
darkened
by
an
expression
of
maniacally
intense
hatred
and
fear
,
which
communicated
a
wild
,
unnatural
force
to
every
feature
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
dilated
in
the
dim
evening
light
,
like
the
eyes
of
a
wild
animal
.
<EOS>
She
caught
up
the
cloth
that
had
fallen
at
her
side
,
as
if
it
had
been
a
living
creature
that
she
could
kill
,
and
crushed
it
in
both
her
hands
with
such
convulsive
strength
,
that
the
few
drops
of
moisture
left
in
it
trickled
down
on
the
stone
beneath
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Talk
of
something
else
,
"
she
said
,
whispering
through
her
teeth
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
lose
myself
if
you
talk
of
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
Every
vestige
of
the
gentler
thoughts
which
had
filled
her
mind
hardly
a
minute
since
seemed
to
be
swept
from
it
now
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
that
the
impression
left
by
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
kindness
was
not
,
as
I
had
supposed
,
the
only
strong
impression
on
her
memory
.
<EOS>
With
the
grateful
remembrance
of
her
school
-
days
at
Limmeridge
,
there
existed
the
vindictive
remembrance
of
the
wrong
inflicted
on
her
by
her
confinement
in
the
Asylum
.
<EOS>
Who
had
done
that
wrong
?
<EOS>
Could
it
really
be
her
mother
?
  
<EOS>
It
was
hard
to
give
up
pursuing
the
inquiry
to
that
final
point
,
but
I
forced
myself
to
abandon
all
idea
of
continuing
it
.
<EOS>
Seeing
her
as
I
saw
her
now
,
it
would
have
been
cruel
to
think
of
anything
but
the
necessity
and
the
humanity
of
restoring
her
composure
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
talk
of
nothing
to
distress
you
,
"
I
said
soothingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
something
,
"
she
answered
sharply
and
suspiciously
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
look
at
me
like
that
.
<EOS>
Speak
to
me
 
tell
me
what
you
want
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
want
you
to
quiet
yourself
,
and
when
you
are
calmer
,
to
think
over
what
I
have
said
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Said
?
"
<EOS>
She
paused
 
twisted
the
cloth
in
her
hands
,
backwards
and
forwards
,
and
whispered
to
herself
,
"
What
is
it
<EOS>
he
said
?
<EOS>
"
She
turned
again
towards
me
,
and
shook
her
head
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
help
me
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
with
angry
suddenness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
I
said
,
"
I
will
help
you
,
and
you
will
soon
remember
.
<EOS>
I
ask
you
to
see
Miss
Fairlie
to
-
morrow
and
to
tell
her
the
truth
about
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
 
<EOS>
Fairlie
 
Fairlie
 
<EOS>
"
  
The
mere
utterance
of
the
loved
familiar
name
seemed
to
quiet
her
.
<EOS>
Her
face
softened
and
grew
like
itself
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
have
no
fear
of
Miss
Fairlie
,
"
I
continued
,
"
and
no
fear
of
getting
into
trouble
through
the
letter
.
<EOS>
She
knows
so
much
about
it
already
,
that
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
telling
her
all
.
<EOS>
There
can
be
little
necessity
for
concealment
where
there
is
hardly
anything
left
to
conceal
.
<EOS>
You
mention
no
names
in
the
letter
;
but
Miss
Fairlie
knows
that
the
person
you
write
of
is
Sir
Percival
Glyde
 
"
  
<EOS>
The
instant
I
pronounced
that
name
<EOS>
she
started
to
her
feet
,
and
a
scream
burst
from
her
that
rang
through
the
churchyard
,
and
made
my
heart
leap
in
me
with
the
terror
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
dark
deformity
of
the
expression
which
had
just
left
her
face
lowered
on
it
once
more
,
with
doubled
and
trebled
intensity
.
<EOS>
The
shriek
at
the
name
,
the
reiterated
look
of
hatred
and
fear
that
instantly
followed
,
told
all
.
<EOS>
Not
even
a
last
doubt
now
remained
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
was
guiltless
of
imprisoning
her
in
the
Asylum
.
<EOS>
A
man
had
shut
her
up
 
and
that
man
was
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
  
<EOS>
The
scream
had
reached
other
ears
than
mine
.
<EOS>
On
one
side
I
heard
the
door
of
the
sexton
's
cottage
open
;
on
the
other
I
heard
the
voice
of
her
companion
,
the
woman
in
the
shawl
,
the
woman
whom
she
had
spoken
of
as
Mrs.
Clements
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
coming
!
<EOS>
I
'm
coming
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
voice
from
behind
the
clump
of
dwarf
trees
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
moment
more
Mrs.
Clements
hurried
into
view
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
facing
me
resolutely
as
she
set
her
foot
on
the
stile
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
dare
you
frighten
a
poor
helpless
woman
like
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
at
Anne
Catherick
's
side
,
and
had
put
one
arm
around
her
,
before
I
could
answer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
is
it
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
has
he
done
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
the
poor
creature
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
.
<EOS>
I
'm
only
frightened
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
turned
on
me
with
a
fearless
indignation
,
for
which
I
respected
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
heartily
ashamed
of
myself
if
I
deserved
that
angry
look
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
not
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
unfortunately
startled
her
without
intending
it
.
<EOS>
This
is
not
the
first
time
she
has
seen
me
.
<EOS>
Ask
her
yourself
,
and
she
will
tell
you
that
I
am
incapable
of
willingly
harming
her
or
any
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
spoke
distinctly
,
so
that
Anne
Catherick
might
hear
and
understand
me
,
and
I
saw
that
the
words
and
their
meaning
had
reached
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
she
said
 
"
he
was
good
to
me
once
 
he
helped
me
 
<EOS>
"
She
whispered
the
rest
into
her
friend
's
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Strange
,
indeed
!
"
said
Mrs.
Clements
,
with
a
look
of
perplexity
.
<EOS>
"
It
makes
all
the
difference
,
though
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
I
spoke
so
rough
to
you
,
sir
;
but
you
must
own
that
appearances
looked
suspicious
to
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
It
's
more
my
fault
than
yours
,
for
humouring
her
whims
,
and
letting
her
be
alone
in
such
a
place
as
this
.
<EOS>
Come
,
my
dear
 
come
home
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thought
the
good
woman
looked
a
little
uneasy
at
the
prospect
of
the
walk
back
,
and
I
offered
to
go
with
them
until
they
were
both
within
sight
of
home
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
thanked
me
civilly
,
and
declined
.
<EOS>
She
said
they
were
sure
to
meet
some
of
the
farm
-
labourers
as
soon
as
they
got
to
the
moor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Try
to
forgive
me
,
"
I
said
,
when
Anne
Catherick
took
her
friend
's
arm
to
go
away
.
<EOS>
Innocent
as
I
had
been
of
any
intention
to
terrify
and
agitate
her
,
my
heart
smote
me
as
I
looked
at
the
poor
,
pale
,
frightened
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
know
too
much
 
<EOS>
I
'm
afraid
you
'll
always
frighten
me
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
glanced
at
me
,
and
shook
her
head
pityingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
,
sir
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
could
n't
help
it
,
I
know
<EOS>
but
I
wish
it
was
me
<EOS>
you
had
frightened
,
and
not
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
moved
away
a
few
steps
.
<EOS>
I
thought
they
had
left
me
,
but
Anne
suddenly
stopped
,
and
separated
herself
from
her
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wait
a
little
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
say
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
returned
to
the
grave
,
rested
both
hands
tenderly
on
the
marble
cross
,
and
kissed
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
better
now
,
"
she
sighed
,
looking
up
at
me
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
I
forgive
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
joined
her
companion
again
,
and
they
left
the
burial
-
ground
.
<EOS>
I
saw
them
stop
near
the
church
and
speak
to
the
sexton
's
wife
,
who
had
come
from
the
cottage
,
and
had
waited
,
watching
us
from
a
distance
.
<EOS>
Then
they
went
on
again
up
the
path
that
led
to
the
moor
.
<EOS>
I
looked
after
Anne
Catherick
as
she
disappeared
,
till
all
trace
of
her
had
faded
in
the
twilight
 
looked
as
anxiously
and
sorrowfully
as
if
that
was
the
last
<EOS>
I
was
to
see
in
this
weary
world
of
the
woman
in
white
.
    
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
later
I
was
back
at
the
house
,
and
was
informing
Miss
Halcombe
of
all
that
had
happened
.
  
<EOS>
She
listened
to
me
from
beginning
to
end
with
a
steady
,
silent
attention
,
which
,
in
a
woman
of
her
temperament
and
disposition
,
was
the
strongest
proof
that
could
be
offered
of
the
serious
manner
in
which
my
narrative
affected
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
mind
misgives
me
,
"
was
all
she
said
when
I
had
done
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
mind
misgives
me
sadly
about
the
future
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
future
may
depend
,
"
I
suggested
,
"
on
the
use
we
make
of
the
present
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
improbable
that
Anne
Catherick
may
speak
more
readily
and
unreservedly
to
a
woman
than
she
has
spoken
to
me
.
<EOS>
If
Miss
Fairlie
 
"
  
"
Not
to
be
thought
of
for
a
moment
,
"
interposed
Miss
Halcombe
,
in
her
most
decided
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
suggest
,
then
,
"
I
continued
,
"
that
you
should
see
Anne
Catherick
yourself
,
and
do
all
you
can
to
win
her
confidence
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
shrink
from
the
idea
of
alarming
the
poor
creature
a
second
time
,
as
I
have
most
unhappily
alarmed
her
already
.
<EOS>
Do
you
see
any
objection
to
accompanying
me
to
the
farmhouse
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
whatever
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
anywhere
and
do
anything
to
serve
Laura
's
interests
.
<EOS>
What
did
you
say
the
place
was
called
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
it
well
.
<EOS>
It
is
called
Todd
's
Corner
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Certainly
.
<EOS>
Todd
's
Corner
is
one
of
Mr.
Fairlie
's
farms
.
<EOS>
Our
dairymaid
here
is
the
farmer
's
second
daughter
.
<EOS>
She
goes
backwards
and
forwards
constantly
between
this
house
and
her
father
's
farm
,
and
she
may
have
heard
or
seen
something
which
it
may
be
useful
to
us
to
know
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
ascertain
,
at
once
,
if
the
girl
is
downstairs
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
rang
the
bell
,
and
sent
the
servant
with
his
message
.
<EOS>
He
returned
,
and
announced
that
the
dairymaid
was
then
at
the
farm
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
been
there
for
the
last
three
days
,
and
the
housekeeper
had
given
her
leave
to
go
home
for
an
hour
or
two
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
speak
to
her
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
Miss
Halcombe
,
when
the
servant
had
left
the
room
again
.
<EOS>
"
In
the
meantime
,
let
me
thoroughly
understand
the
object
to
be
gained
by
my
interview
with
Anne
Catherick
.
<EOS>
Is
there
no
doubt
in
your
mind
that
the
person
who
confined
her
in
the
Asylum
was
Sir
Percival
Glyde
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
not
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
The
only
mystery
that
remains
is
the
mystery
of
his
MOTIVE
.
<EOS>
Looking
to
the
great
difference
between
his
station
in
life
and
hers
,
which
seems
to
preclude
all
idea
of
the
most
distant
relationship
between
them
,
it
is
of
the
last
importance
 
even
assuming
that
she
really
required
to
be
placed
under
restraint
 
to
know
why
HE
should
have
been
the
person
to
assume
the
serious
responsibility
of
shutting
her
up
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
a
private
Asylum
,
I
think
you
said
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
in
a
private
Asylum
,
where
a
sum
of
money
,
which
no
poor
person
could
afford
to
give
,
must
have
been
paid
for
her
maintenance
as
a
patient
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
where
the
doubt
lies
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
and
I
promise
you
that
it
shall
be
set
at
rest
,
whether
Anne
Catherick
assists
us
to
-
morrow
or
not
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
Glyde
shall
not
be
long
in
this
house
without
satisfying
Mr.
Gilmore
,
and
satisfying
me
.
<EOS>
My
sister
's
future
is
my
dearest
care
in
life
,
and
I
have
influence
enough
over
her
to
give
me
some
power
,
where
her
marriage
is
concerned
,
in
the
disposal
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
parted
for
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
After
breakfast
the
next
morning
,
an
obstacle
,
which
the
events
of
the
evening
before
had
put
out
of
my
memory
,
interposed
to
prevent
our
proceeding
immediately
to
the
farm
.
<EOS>
This
was
my
last
day
at
Limmeridge
House
,
and
it
was
necessary
,
as
soon
as
the
post
came
in
,
to
follow
Miss
Halcombe
's
advice
,
and
to
ask
Mr.
Fairlie
's
permission
to
shorten
my
engagement
by
a
month
,
in
consideration
of
an
unforeseen
necessity
for
my
return
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
Fortunately
for
the
probability
of
this
excuse
,
so
far
as
appearances
were
concerned
,
the
post
brought
me
two
letters
from
London
friends
that
morning
.
<EOS>
I
took
them
away
at
once
to
my
own
room
,
and
sent
the
servant
with
a
message
to
Mr.
Fairlie
,
requesting
to
know
when
I
could
see
him
on
a
matter
of
business
.
  
<EOS>
I
awaited
the
man
's
return
,
free
from
the
slightest
feeling
of
anxiety
about
the
manner
in
which
his
master
might
receive
my
application
.
<EOS>
With
Mr.
Fairlie
's
leave
or
without
it
,
I
must
go
.
<EOS>
The
consciousness
of
having
now
taken
the
first
step
on
the
dreary
journey
which
was
henceforth
to
separate
my
life
from
Miss
Fairlie
's
seemed
to
have
blunted
my
sensibility
to
every
consideration
connected
with
myself
.
<EOS>
I
had
done
with
my
poor
man
's
touchy
pride
 
<EOS>
I
had
done
with
all
my
little
artist
vanities
.
<EOS>
No
insolence
of
Mr.
Fairlie
's
,
if
he
chose
to
be
insolent
,
could
wound
me
now
.
  
<EOS>
The
servant
returned
with
a
message
for
which
I
was
not
unprepared
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
regretted
that
the
state
of
his
health
,
on
that
particular
morning
,
was
such
as
to
preclude
all
hope
of
his
having
the
pleasure
of
receiving
me
.
<EOS>
He
begged
,
therefore
,
that
I
would
accept
his
apologies
,
and
kindly
communicate
what
I
had
to
say
in
the
form
of
a
letter
.
<EOS>
Similar
messages
to
this
had
reached
me
,
at
various
intervals
,
during
my
three
months
'
residence
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Throughout
the
whole
of
that
period
Mr.
Fairlie
had
been
rejoiced
to
"
possess
"
me
,
but
had
never
been
well
enough
to
see
me
for
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
The
servant
took
every
fresh
batch
of
drawings
that
I
mounted
and
restored
back
to
his
master
with
my
"
respects
,
"
and
returned
empty
-
handed
with
Mr.
Fairlie
's
"
kind
compliments
,
"
"
best
thanks
,
"
and
"
sincere
regrets
"
that
the
state
of
his
health
still
obliged
him
to
remain
a
solitary
prisoner
in
his
own
room
.
<EOS>
A
more
satisfactory
arrangement
to
both
sides
could
not
possibly
have
been
adopted
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
hard
to
say
which
of
us
,
under
the
circumstances
,
felt
the
most
grateful
sense
of
obligation
to
Mr.
Fairlie
's
accommodating
nerves
.
  
<EOS>
I
sat
down
at
once
to
write
the
letter
,
expressing
myself
in
it
as
civilly
,
as
clearly
,
and
as
briefly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
did
not
hurry
his
reply
.
<EOS>
Nearly
an
hour
elapsed
before
the
answer
was
placed
in
my
hands
.
<EOS>
It
was
written
with
beautiful
regularity
and
neatness
of
character
,
in
violet
-
coloured
ink
,
on
note
-
paper
as
smooth
as
ivory
and
almost
as
thick
as
cardboard
,
and
it
addressed
me
in
these
terms
    
"
Mr.
Fairlie
's
compliments
to
Mr.
Hartright
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
is
more
surprised
and
disappointed
than
he
can
say
(
in
the
present
state
of
his
health
)
by
Mr.
Hartright
's
application
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
is
not
a
man
of
business
,
but
he
has
consulted
his
steward
,
who
is
,
and
that
person
confirms
Mr.
Fairlie
's
opinion
that
Mr.
Hartright
's
request
to
be
allowed
to
break
his
engagement
can
not
be
justified
by
any
necessity
whatever
,
excepting
perhaps
a
case
of
life
and
death
.
<EOS>
If
the
highly
-
appreciative
feeling
towards
Art
and
its
professors
,
which
it
is
the
consolation
and
happiness
of
Mr.
Fairlie
's
suffering
existence
to
cultivate
,
could
be
easily
shaken
,
Mr.
Hartright
's
present
proceeding
would
have
shaken
it
.
<EOS>
It
has
not
done
so
 
except
in
the
instance
of
Mr.
Hartright
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Having
stated
his
opinion
 
so
far
,
that
is
to
say
,
as
acute
nervous
suffering
will
allow
him
to
state
anything
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
has
nothing
to
add
but
the
expression
of
his
decision
,
in
reference
to
the
highly
irregular
application
that
has
been
made
to
him
.
<EOS>
Perfect
repose
of
body
and
mind
being
to
the
last
degree
important
in
his
case
,
Mr.
Fairlie
will
not
suffer
Mr.
Hartright
to
disturb
that
repose
by
remaining
in
the
house
under
circumstances
of
an
essentially
irritating
nature
to
both
sides
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
Mr.
Fairlie
waives
his
right
of
refusal
,
purely
with
a
view
to
the
preservation
of
his
own
tranquillity
 
and
informs
Mr.
Hartright
that
he
may
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
folded
the
letter
up
,
and
put
it
away
with
my
other
papers
.
<EOS>
The
time
had
been
when
I
should
have
resented
it
as
an
insult
 
<EOS>
I
accepted
it
now
as
a
written
release
from
my
engagement
.
<EOS>
It
was
off
my
mind
,
it
was
almost
out
of
my
memory
,
when
I
went
downstairs
to
the
breakfast
-
room
,
and
informed
Miss
Halcombe
that
I
was
ready
to
walk
with
her
to
the
farm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Has
Mr.
Fairlie
given
you
a
satisfactory
answer
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
as
we
left
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
allowed
me
to
go
,
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
up
at
me
quickly
,
and
then
,
for
the
first
time
since
I
had
known
her
,
took
my
arm
of
her
own
accord
.
<EOS>
No
words
could
have
expressed
so
delicately
that
she
understood
how
the
permission
to
leave
my
employment
had
been
granted
,
and
that
she
gave
me
her
sympathy
,
not
as
my
superior
,
but
as
my
friend
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
felt
the
man
's
insolent
letter
,
but
I
felt
deeply
the
woman
's
atoning
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
On
our
way
to
the
farm
we
arranged
that
Miss
Halcombe
was
to
enter
the
house
alone
,
and
that
I
was
to
wait
outside
,
within
call
.
<EOS>
We
adopted
this
mode
of
proceeding
from
an
apprehension
that
my
presence
,
after
what
had
happened
in
the
churchyard
the
evening
before
,
might
have
the
effect
of
renewing
Anne
Catherick
's
nervous
dread
,
and
of
rendering
her
additionally
distrustful
of
the
advances
of
a
lady
who
was
a
stranger
to
her
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
left
me
,
with
the
intention
of
speaking
,
in
the
first
instance
,
to
the
farmer
's
wife
(
of
whose
friendly
readiness
to
help
her
in
any
way
she
was
well
assured
)
,
while
I
waited
for
her
in
the
near
neighbourhood
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
fully
expected
to
be
left
alone
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
To
my
surprise
,
however
,
little
more
than
five
minutes
had
elapsed
before
Miss
Halcombe
returned
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
Anne
Catherick
refuse
to
see
you
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
in
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Anne
Catherick
is
gone
,
"
replied
Miss
Halcombe
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gone
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gone
with
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
They
both
left
the
farm
at
eight
o'clock
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
could
say
nothing
 
I
could
only
feel
that
our
last
chance
of
discovery
had
gone
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
that
Mrs.
Todd
knows
about
her
guests
,
I
know
,
"
Miss
Halcombe
went
on
,
"
and
it
leaves
me
,
as
it
leaves
her
,
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
They
both
came
back
safe
last
night
,
after
they
left
you
,
and
they
passed
the
first
part
of
the
evening
with
Mr.
Todd
's
family
as
usual
.
<EOS>
Just
before
supper
-
time
,
however
,
Anne
Catherick
startled
them
all
by
being
suddenly
seized
with
faintness
.
<EOS>
She
had
had
a
similar
attack
,
of
a
less
alarming
kind
,
on
the
day
she
arrived
at
the
farm
;
and
Mrs.
Todd
had
connected
it
,
on
that
occasion
,
with
something
she
was
reading
at
the
time
in
our
local
newspaper
,
which
lay
on
the
farm
table
,
and
which
she
had
taken
up
only
a
minute
or
two
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Does
Mrs.
Todd
know
what
particular
passage
in
the
newspaper
affected
her
in
that
way
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
"
She
had
looked
it
over
,
and
had
seen
nothing
in
it
to
agitate
any
one
.
<EOS>
I
asked
leave
,
however
,
to
look
it
over
in
my
turn
,
and
at
the
very
first
page
I
opened
I
found
that
the
editor
had
enriched
his
small
stock
of
news
by
drawing
upon
our
family
affairs
,
and
had
published
my
sister
's
marriage
engagement
,
among
his
other
announcements
,
copied
from
the
London
papers
,
of
Marriages
in
High
Life
.
<EOS>
I
concluded
at
once
that
this
was
the
paragraph
which
had
so
strangely
affected
Anne
Catherick
,
and
I
thought
I
saw
in
it
,
also
,
the
origin
of
the
letter
which
she
sent
to
our
house
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
can
be
no
doubt
in
either
case
.
<EOS>
But
what
did
you
hear
about
her
second
attack
of
faintness
yesterday
evening
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nothing
.
<EOS>
The
cause
of
it
is
a
complete
mystery
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
stranger
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
only
visitor
was
our
dairymaid
,
who
,
as
I
told
you
,
is
one
of
Mr.
Todd
's
daughters
,
and
the
only
conversation
was
the
usual
gossip
about
local
affairs
.
<EOS>
They
heard
her
cry
out
,
and
saw
her
turn
deadly
pale
,
without
the
slightest
apparent
reason
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Todd
and
Mrs.
Clements
took
her
upstairs
,
and
Mrs.
Clements
remained
with
her
.
<EOS>
They
were
heard
talking
together
until
long
after
the
usual
bedtime
,
and
early
this
morning
Mrs.
Clements
took
Mrs.
Todd
aside
,
and
amazed
her
beyond
all
power
of
expression
by
saying
that
they
must
go
.
<EOS>
The
only
explanation
Mrs.
Todd
could
extract
from
her
guest
was
,
that
something
had
happened
,
which
was
not
the
fault
of
any
one
at
the
farmhouse
,
but
which
was
serious
enough
to
make
Anne
Catherick
resolve
to
leave
Limmeridge
immediately
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
useless
to
press
Mrs.
Clements
to
be
more
explicit
.
<EOS>
She
only
shook
her
head
,
and
said
that
,
for
Anne
's
sake
,
she
must
beg
and
pray
that
no
one
would
question
her
.
<EOS>
All
she
could
repeat
,
with
every
appearance
of
being
seriously
agitated
herself
,
was
that
Anne
must
go
,
that
she
must
go
with
her
,
and
that
the
destination
to
which
they
might
both
betake
themselves
must
be
kept
a
secret
from
everybody
.
<EOS>
I
spare
you
the
recital
of
Mrs.
Todd
's
hospitable
remonstrances
and
refusals
.
<EOS>
It
ended
in
her
driving
them
both
to
the
nearest
station
,
more
than
three
hours
since
.
<EOS>
She
tried
hard
on
the
way
to
get
them
to
speak
more
plainly
,
but
without
success
;
and
she
set
them
down
outside
the
station
-
door
,
so
hurt
and
offended
by
the
unceremonious
abruptness
of
their
departure
and
their
unfriendly
reluctance
to
place
the
least
confidence
in
her
,
that
she
drove
away
in
anger
,
without
so
much
as
stopping
to
bid
them
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
That
is
exactly
what
has
taken
place
.
<EOS>
Search
your
own
memory
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
and
tell
me
if
anything
happened
in
the
burial
-
ground
yesterday
evening
which
can
at
all
account
for
the
extraordinary
departure
of
those
two
women
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
should
like
to
account
first
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
for
the
sudden
change
in
Anne
Catherick
which
alarmed
them
at
the
farmhouse
,
hours
after
she
and
I
had
parted
,
and
when
time
enough
had
elapsed
to
quiet
any
violent
agitation
that
I
might
have
been
unfortunate
enough
to
cause
.
<EOS>
Did
you
inquire
particularly
about
the
gossip
which
was
going
on
in
the
room
when
she
turned
faint
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Todd
's
household
affairs
seem
to
have
divided
her
attention
that
evening
with
the
talk
in
the
farmhouse
parlour
.
<EOS>
She
could
only
tell
me
that
it
was
"
just
the
news
,
"
 
meaning
,
I
suppose
,
that
they
all
talked
as
usual
about
each
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
dairymaid
's
memory
may
be
better
than
her
mother
's
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
as
well
for
you
to
speak
to
the
girl
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
as
soon
as
we
get
back
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
suggestion
was
acted
on
the
moment
we
returned
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
led
me
round
to
the
servants
'
offices
,
and
we
found
the
girl
in
the
dairy
,
with
her
sleeves
tucked
up
to
her
shoulders
,
cleaning
a
large
milk
-
pan
and
singing
blithely
over
her
work
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
brought
this
gentleman
to
see
your
dairy
,
Hannah
,
"
said
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
one
of
the
sights
of
the
house
,
and
it
always
does
you
credit
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
girl
blushed
and
curtseyed
,
and
said
shyly
that
she
hoped
she
always
did
her
best
to
keep
things
neat
and
clean
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
just
come
from
your
father
's
,
"
Miss
Halcombe
continued
.
<EOS>
"
You
were
there
yesterday
evening
,
I
hear
,
and
you
found
visitors
at
the
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
miss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
of
them
was
taken
faint
and
ill
,
I
am
told
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
nothing
was
said
or
done
to
frighten
her
?
<EOS>
You
were
not
talking
of
anything
very
terrible
,
were
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
miss
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
girl
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
We
were
only
talking
of
the
news
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
sisters
told
you
the
news
at
Todd
's
Corner
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
miss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
told
them
the
news
at
Limmeridge
House
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
miss
.
<EOS>
And
I
'm
quite
sure
nothing
was
said
to
frighten
the
poor
thing
,
for
I
was
talking
when
she
was
taken
ill
.
<EOS>
It
gave
me
quite
a
turn
,
miss
,
to
see
it
,
never
having
been
taken
faint
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Before
any
more
questions
could
be
put
to
her
,
she
was
called
away
to
receive
a
basket
of
eggs
at
the
dairy
door
.
<EOS>
As
she
left
us
I
whispered
to
Miss
Halcombe
    
<EOS>
"
Ask
her
if
she
happened
to
mention
,
last
night
,
that
visitors
were
expected
at
Limmeridge
House
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
showed
me
,
by
a
look
,
that
she
understood
,
and
put
the
question
as
soon
as
the
dairymaid
returned
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
miss
<EOS>
,
I
mentioned
that
,
"
said
the
girl
simply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
company
coming
,
and
the
accident
to
the
brindled
cow
,
was
all
the
news
I
had
to
take
to
the
farm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
mention
names
?
<EOS>
Did
you
tell
them
that
Sir
Percival
Glyde
was
expected
on
Monday
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
miss
 
<EOS>
I
told
them
Sir
Percival
Glyde
was
coming
.
<EOS>
I
hope
there
was
no
harm
in
it
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
did
n't
do
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
no
harm
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
Hannah
will
begin
to
think
us
in
the
way
,
if
we
interrupt
her
any
longer
over
her
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
stopped
and
looked
at
one
another
the
moment
we
were
alone
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
any
doubt
in
your
mind
,
NOW
,
Miss
Halcombe
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Percival
Glyde
shall
remove
that
doubt
,
Mr.
Hartright
 
or
Laura
Fairlie
shall
never
be
his
wife
.
"
    
<EOS>
As
we
walked
round
to
the
front
of
the
house
a
fly
from
the
railway
approached
us
along
the
drive
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
waited
on
the
door
-
steps
until
the
fly
drew
up
,
and
then
advanced
to
shake
hands
with
an
old
gentleman
,
who
got
out
briskly
the
moment
the
steps
were
let
down
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gilmore
had
arrived
.
  
<EOS>
I
looked
at
him
,
when
we
were
introduced
to
each
other
,
with
an
interest
and
a
curiosity
which
I
could
hardly
conceal
.
<EOS>
This
old
man
was
to
remain
at
Limmeridge
House
after
I
had
left
it
,
he
was
to
hear
Sir
Percival
Glyde
's
explanation
,
and
was
to
give
Miss
Halcombe
the
assistance
of
his
experience
in
forming
her
judgment
;
he
was
to
wait
until
the
question
of
the
marriage
was
set
at
rest
;
and
his
hand
,
if
that
question
were
decided
in
the
affirmative
,
was
to
draw
the
settlement
which
bound
Miss
Fairlie
irrevocably
to
her
engagement
.
<EOS>
Even
then
,
when
I
knew
nothing
by
comparison
with
what
I
know
now
,
I
looked
at
the
family
lawyer
with
an
interest
which
I
had
never
felt
before
in
the
presence
of
any
man
breathing
who
was
a
total
stranger
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
In
external
appearance
Mr.
Gilmore
was
the
exact
opposite
of
the
conventional
idea
of
an
old
lawyer
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
was
florid
 
<EOS>
his
white
hair
was
worn
rather
long
and
kept
carefully
brushed
 
his
black
coat
,
waistcoat
,
and
trousers
fitted
him
with
perfect
neatness
 
<EOS>
his
white
cravat
was
carefully
tied
,
and
his
lavender
-
coloured
kid
gloves
might
have
adorned
the
hands
of
a
fashionable
clergyman
,
without
fear
and
without
reproach
.
<EOS>
His
manners
were
pleasantly
marked
by
the
formal
grace
and
refinement
of
the
old
school
of
politeness
,
quickened
by
the
invigorating
sharpness
and
readiness
of
a
man
whose
business
in
life
obliges
him
always
to
keep
his
faculties
in
good
working
order
.
<EOS>
A
sanguine
constitution
and
fair
prospects
to
begin
with
 
a
long
subsequent
career
of
creditable
and
comfortable
prosperity
 
a
cheerful
,
diligent
,
widely
-
respected
old
age
 
such
were
the
general
impressions
I
derived
from
my
introduction
to
Mr.
Gilmore
,
and
it
is
but
fair
to
him
to
add
,
that
the
knowledge
I
gained
by
later
and
better
experience
only
tended
to
confirm
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
left
the
old
gentleman
and
Miss
Halcombe
to
enter
the
house
together
,
and
to
talk
of
family
matters
undisturbed
by
the
restraint
of
a
stranger
's
presence
.
<EOS>
They
crossed
the
hall
on
their
way
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
I
descended
the
steps
again
to
wander
about
the
garden
alone
.
  
<EOS>
My
hours
were
numbered
at
Limmeridge
House
 
my
departure
the
next
morning
was
irrevocably
settled
 
<EOS>
my
share
in
the
investigation
which
the
anonymous
letter
had
rendered
necessary
was
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
No
harm
could
be
done
to
any
one
but
myself
if
I
let
my
heart
loose
again
,
for
the
little
time
that
was
left
me
,
from
the
cold
cruelty
of
restraint
which
necessity
had
forced
me
to
inflict
upon
it
,
and
took
my
farewell
of
the
scenes
which
were
associated
with
the
brief
dream
-
time
of
my
happiness
and
my
love
.
  
<EOS>
I
turned
instinctively
to
the
walk
beneath
my
study
-
window
,
where
I
had
seen
her
the
evening
before
with
her
little
dog
,
and
followed
the
path
which
her
dear
feet
had
trodden
so
often
,
till
I
came
to
the
wicket
gate
that
led
into
her
rose
garden
.
<EOS>
The
winter
bareness
spread
drearily
over
it
now
.
<EOS>
The
flowers
that
she
had
taught
me
to
distinguish
by
their
names
,
the
flowers
that
I
had
taught
her
to
paint
from
,
were
gone
,
and
the
tiny
white
paths
that
led
between
the
beds
were
damp
and
green
already
.
<EOS>
I
went
on
to
the
avenue
of
trees
,
where
we
had
breathed
together
the
warm
fragrance
of
August
evenings
,
where
we
had
admired
together
the
myriad
combinations
of
shade
and
sunlight
that
dappled
the
ground
at
our
feet
.
<EOS>
The
leaves
fell
about
me
from
the
groaning
branches
,
and
the
earthy
decay
in
the
atmosphere
chilled
me
to
the
bones
.
<EOS>
A
little
farther
on
,
<EOS>
and
I
was
out
of
the
grounds
,
and
following
the
lane
that
wound
gently
upward
to
the
nearest
hills
.
<EOS>
The
old
felled
tree
by
the
wayside
,
on
which
we
had
sat
to
rest
,
was
sodden
with
rain
,
and
the
tuft
of
ferns
and
grasses
which
I
had
drawn
for
her
,
nestling
under
the
rough
stone
wall
in
front
of
us
,
had
turned
to
a
pool
of
water
,
stagnating
round
an
island
of
draggled
weeds
.
<EOS>
I
gained
the
summit
of
the
hill
,
and
looked
at
the
view
which
we
had
so
often
admired
in
the
happier
time
.
<EOS>
It
was
cold
and
barren
 
<EOS>
it
was
no
longer
the
view
that
I
remembered
.
<EOS>
The
sunshine
of
her
presence
was
far
from
me
 
the
charm
of
her
voice
no
longer
murmured
in
my
ear
.
<EOS>
She
had
talked
to
me
,
on
the
spot
from
which
I
now
looked
down
,
of
her
father
,
who
was
her
last
surviving
parent
 
had
told
me
how
fond
of
each
other
they
had
been
,
and
how
sadly
she
missed
him
still
when
she
entered
certain
rooms
in
the
house
,
and
when
she
took
up
forgotten
occupations
and
amusements
with
which
he
had
been
associated
.
<EOS>
Was
the
view
that
I
had
seen
,
while
listening
to
those
words
,
the
view
that
I
saw
now
,
standing
on
the
hill
-
top
by
myself
?
<EOS>
I
turned
and
left
it
 
<EOS>
I
wound
my
way
back
again
,
over
the
moor
,
and
round
the
sandhills
,
down
to
the
beach
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
white
rage
of
the
surf
,
and
the
multitudinous
glory
of
the
leaping
waves
 
but
<EOS>
where
was
the
place
on
which
she
had
once
drawn
idle
figures
with
her
parasol
in
the
sand
 
<EOS>
the
place
where
we
had
sat
together
,
while
she
talked
to
me
about
myself
and
my
home
,
while
she
asked
me
a
woman
's
minutely
observant
questions
about
my
mother
and
my
sister
,
and
innocently
wondered
whether
I
should
ever
leave
my
lonely
chambers
and
have
a
wife
and
a
house
of
my
own
?
<EOS>
Wind
and
wave
had
long
since
smoothed
out
the
trace
of
her
which
she
had
left
in
those
marks
on
the
sand
,
I
looked
over
the
wide
monotony
of
the
sea
-
side
prospect
,
and
the
place
in
which
we
two
had
idled
away
the
sunny
hours
was
as
lost
to
me
as
if
I
had
never
known
it
,
as
strange
to
me
as
if
I
stood
already
on
a
foreign
shore
.
  
<EOS>
The
empty
silence
of
the
beach
struck
cold
to
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
returned
to
the
house
and
the
garden
,
where
traces
were
left
to
speak
of
her
at
every
turn
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
west
terrace
walk
I
met
Mr.
Gilmore
.
<EOS>
He
was
evidently
in
search
of
me
,
for
he
quickened
his
pace
when
we
caught
sight
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
The
state
of
my
spirits
little
fitted
me
for
the
society
of
a
stranger
;
but
the
meeting
was
inevitable
,
and
I
resigned
myself
to
make
the
best
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
very
person
I
wanted
to
see
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
two
words
to
say
to
you
,
my
dear
sir
;
and
If
you
have
no
objection
I
will
avail
myself
of
the
present
opportunity
.
<EOS>
To
put
it
plainly
,
Miss
Halcombe
and
I
have
been
talking
over
family
affairs
 
affairs
which
are
the
cause
of
my
being
here
 
<EOS>
and
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
she
was
naturally
led
to
tell
me
of
this
unpleasant
matter
connected
with
the
anonymous
letter
,
and
of
the
share
<EOS>
which
you
have
most
creditably
and
properly
taken
in
the
proceedings
so
far
.
<EOS>
That
share
,
I
quite
understand
,
gives
you
an
interest
which
you
might
not
otherwise
have
felt
,
in
knowing
that
the
future
management
of
the
investigation
which
you
have
begun
will
be
placed
in
safe
hands
.
<EOS>
My
dear
sir
,
make
yourself
quite
easy
on
that
point
 
it
will
be
placed
in
MY
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
,
in
every
way
,
Mr.
Gilmore
,
much
fitter
to
advise
and
to
act
in
the
matter
than
I
am
.
<EOS>
Is
it
an
indiscretion
on
my
part
to
ask
if
you
have
decided
yet
on
a
course
of
proceeding
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
far
as
it
is
possible
to
decide
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
I
have
decided
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
send
a
copy
of
the
letter
,
accompanied
by
a
statement
of
the
circumstances
,
to
Sir
Percival
Glyde
's
solicitor
in
London
,
with
whom
I
have
some
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
The
letter
itself
I
shall
keep
here
to
show
to
Sir
Percival
as
soon
as
he
arrives
.
<EOS>
The
tracing
of
the
two
women
I
have
already
provided
for
,
by
sending
one
of
Mr.
Fairlie
's
servants
 
a
confidential
person
 
to
the
station
to
make
inquiries
.
<EOS>
The
man
has
his
money
and
his
directions
,
and
he
will
follow
the
women
in
the
event
of
his
finding
any
clue
.
<EOS>
This
is
all
that
can
be
done
until
Sir
Percival
comes
on
Monday
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
myself
that
every
explanation
which
can
be
expected
from
a
gentleman
and
a
man
of
honour
,
he
will
readily
give
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
stands
very
high
,
sir
 
an
eminent
position
,
a
reputation
above
suspicion
 
I
feel
quite
easy
about
results
 
quite
easy
,
I
am
rejoiced
to
assure
you
.
<EOS>
Things
of
this
sort
happen
constantly
in
my
experience
.
<EOS>
Anonymous
letters
 
<EOS>
unfortunate
woman
 
sad
state
of
society
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
deny
that
there
are
peculiar
complications
in
this
case
;
but
the
case
itself
is
,
most
unhappily
,
common
 
common
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
Mr.
Gilmore
,
I
have
the
misfortune
to
differ
from
you
in
the
view
I
take
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Just
so
,
my
dear
sir
 
<EOS>
just
so
.
<EOS>
I
am
an
old
man
,
and
I
take
the
practical
view
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
young
man
,
and
you
take
the
romantic
view
.
<EOS>
Let
us
not
dispute
about
our
views
.
<EOS>
I
live
professionally
in
an
atmosphere
of
disputation
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
and
I
am
only
too
glad
to
escape
from
it
,
as
I
am
escaping
here
.
<EOS>
We
will
wait
for
events
 
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
yes
 
we
will
wait
for
events
.
<EOS>
Charming
place
this
.
<EOS>
Good
shooting
?
<EOS>
Probably
not
,
none
of
Mr.
Fairlie
's
land
is
preserved
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
Charming
place
,
though
,
and
delightful
people
.
<EOS>
You
draw
and
paint
,
I
hear
,
Mr.
Hartright
?
<EOS>
Enviable
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
What
style
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
dropped
into
general
conversation
,
or
rather
,
Mr.
Gilmore
talked
and
I
listened
.
<EOS>
My
attention
was
far
from
him
,
and
from
the
topics
on
which
he
discoursed
so
fluently
.
<EOS>
The
solitary
walk
of
the
last
two
hours
had
wrought
its
effect
on
me
 
<EOS>
it
had
set
the
idea
in
my
mind
of
hastening
my
departure
from
Limmeridge
House
.
<EOS>
Why
should
I
prolong
the
hard
trial
of
saying
farewell
by
one
unnecessary
minute
?
<EOS>
What
further
service
was
required
of
me
by
any
one
?
<EOS>
There
was
no
useful
purpose
to
be
served
by
my
stay
in
Cumberland
 
<EOS>
there
was
no
restriction
of
time
in
the
permission
to
leave
which
my
employer
had
granted
to
me
.
<EOS>
Why
not
end
it
there
<EOS>
and
then
?
  
<EOS>
I
determined
to
end
it
.
<EOS>
There
were
some
hours
of
daylight
still
left
 
there
was
no
reason
why
my
journey
back
to
London
should
not
begin
on
that
afternoon
.
<EOS>
I
made
the
first
civil
excuse
that
occurred
to
me
for
leaving
Mr.
Gilmore
,
and
returned
at
once
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
On
my
way
up
to
my
own
room
I
met
Miss
Halcombe
on
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
She
saw
,
by
the
hurry
of
my
movements
and
the
change
in
my
manner
,
that
I
had
some
new
purpose
in
view
,
and
asked
what
had
happened
.
  
<EOS>
I
told
her
the
reasons
which
induced
me
to
think
of
hastening
my
departure
,
exactly
as
I
have
told
them
here
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
she
said
,
earnestly
and
kindly
,
"
leave
us
like
a
friend
 
<EOS>
break
bread
with
us
once
more
.
<EOS>
Stay
here
and
dine
,
stay
here
and
help
us
to
spend
our
last
evening
with
you
as
happily
,
as
like
our
first
evenings
,
as
we
can
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
invitation
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vesey
's
invitation
 
<EOS>
"
she
hesitated
a
little
,
and
then
added
,
"
Laura
's
invitation
as
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
promised
to
remain
.
<EOS>
God
knows
I
had
no
wish
to
leave
even
the
shadow
of
a
sorrowful
impression
with
any
one
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
My
own
room
was
the
best
place
for
me
till
the
dinner
bell
rang
.
<EOS>
I
waited
there
till
it
was
time
to
go
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
not
spoken
to
Miss
Fairlie
 
<EOS>
I
had
not
even
seen
her
 
all
that
day
.
<EOS>
The
first
meeting
with
her
,
when
I
entered
the
drawing
-
room
,
was
a
hard
trial
to
her
self
-
control
and
to
mine
.
<EOS>
She
,
too
,
had
done
her
best
to
make
our
last
evening
renew
the
golden
bygone
time
 
the
time
that
could
never
come
again
.
<EOS>
She
had
put
on
the
dress
which
I
used
to
admire
more
than
any
other
that
she
possessed
 
a
dark
blue
silk
,
trimmed
quaintly
and
prettily
with
old
-
fashioned
lace
;
she
came
forward
to
meet
me
with
her
former
readiness
 
<EOS>
she
gave
me
her
hand
with
the
frank
,
innocent
good
-
will
of
happier
days
.
<EOS>
The
cold
fingers
that
trembled
round
mine
 
the
pale
cheeks
with
a
bright
red
spot
burning
in
the
midst
of
them
 
the
faint
smile
that
struggled
to
live
on
her
lips
and
died
away
from
them
while
I
looked
at
it
,
told
me
at
what
sacrifice
of
herself
her
outward
composure
was
maintained
.
<EOS>
My
heart
could
take
her
no
closer
to
me
,
or
I
should
have
loved
her
then
as
I
had
never
loved
her
yet
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gilmore
was
a
great
assistance
to
us
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
high
good
-
humour
,
and
he
led
the
conversation
with
unflagging
spirit
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
seconded
him
resolutely
,
and
I
did
all
I
could
to
follow
her
example
.
<EOS>
The
kind
blue
eyes
,
whose
slightest
changes
of
expression
I
had
learnt
to
interpret
so
well
,
looked
at
me
appealingly
when
we
first
sat
down
to
table
.
<EOS>
Help
my
sister
 
the
sweet
anxious
face
seemed
to
say
 
help
my
sister
,
and
you
will
help
me
.
  
<EOS>
We
got
through
the
dinner
,
to
all
outward
appearance
at
least
,
happily
enough
.
<EOS>
When
the
ladies
had
risen
from
table
,
and
Mr.
Gilmore
and
I
were
left
alone
in
the
dining
-
room
,
a
new
interest
presented
itself
to
occupy
our
attention
,
and
to
give
me
an
opportunity
of
quieting
myself
by
a
few
minutes
of
needful
and
welcome
silence
.
<EOS>
The
servant
who
had
been
despatched
to
trace
Anne
Catherick
and
Mrs.
Clements
returned
with
his
report
,
and
was
shown
into
the
dining
-
room
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mr.
Gilmore
,
"
what
have
you
found
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
found
out
,
sir
,
"
answered
the
man
,
"
that
both
the
women
took
tickets
at
our
station
here
for
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
went
to
Carlisle
,
of
course
,
when
you
heard
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
sir
,
but
I
am
sorry
to
say
I
could
find
no
further
trace
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
inquired
at
the
railway
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
at
the
different
inns
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
left
the
statement
I
wrote
for
you
at
the
police
station
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
friend
,
you
have
done
all
you
could
,
and
I
have
done
all
I
could
,
and
there
the
matter
must
rest
till
further
notice
.
<EOS>
We
have
played
our
trump
cards
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
"
continued
the
old
gentleman
when
the
servant
had
withdrawn
.
<EOS>
"
For
the
present
,
at
least
,
the
women
have
outmanoeuvred
us
,
and
our
only
resource
now
is
to
wait
till
Sir
Percival
Glyde
comes
here
on
Monday
next
.
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
fill
your
glass
again
?
<EOS>
Good
bottle
of
port
,
that
 
sound
,
substantial
,
old
wine
.
<EOS>
I
have
got
better
in
my
own
cellar
,
though
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
returned
to
the
drawing
-
room
 
the
room
in
which
the
happiest
evenings
of
my
life
had
been
passed
 
the
room
which
,
after
this
last
night
,
I
was
never
to
see
again
.
<EOS>
Its
aspect
was
altered
since
the
days
had
shortened
and
the
weather
had
grown
cold
.
<EOS>
The
glass
doors
on
the
terrace
side
were
closed
,
and
hidden
by
thick
curtains
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
the
soft
twilight
obscurity
,
in
which
we
used
to
sit
,
the
bright
radiant
glow
of
lamplight
now
dazzled
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
All
was
changed
 
indoors
and
<EOS>
out
all
was
changed
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
and
Mr.
Gilmore
sat
down
together
at
the
card
-
table
 
Mrs.
Vesey
took
her
customary
chair
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
restraint
on
the
disposal
of
THEIR
evening
,
and
I
felt
the
restraint
on
the
disposal
of
mine
all
the
more
painfully
from
observing
it
.
<EOS>
I
saw
Miss
Fairlie
lingering
near
the
music
-
stand
.
<EOS>
The
time
had
been
when
I
might
have
joined
her
there
.
<EOS>
I
waited
irresolutely
 
<EOS>
I
knew
neither
where
to
go
nor
what
to
do
next
.
<EOS>
She
cast
one
quick
glance
at
me
,
took
a
piece
of
music
suddenly
from
the
stand
,
and
came
towards
me
of
her
own
accord
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
play
some
of
those
little
melodies
of
Mozart
's
which
you
used
to
like
so
much
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
opening
the
music
nervously
,
and
looking
down
at
it
while
she
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
Before
I
could
thank
her
<EOS>
she
hastened
to
the
piano
.
<EOS>
The
chair
near
it
,
which
I
had
always
been
accustomed
to
occupy
,
stood
empty
.
<EOS>
She
struck
a
few
chords
 
then
glanced
round
at
me
 
then
looked
back
again
at
her
music
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
take
your
old
place
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
,
speaking
very
abruptly
and
in
very
low
tones
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
take
it
on
the
last
night
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
reply
 
<EOS>
she
kept
her
attention
riveted
on
the
music
 
music
which
she
knew
by
memory
,
which
she
had
played
over
and
over
again
,
in
former
times
,
without
the
book
.
<EOS>
I
only
knew
that
she
had
heard
me
<EOS>
,
I
only
knew
that
she
was
aware
of
my
being
close
to
her
,
by
seeing
the
red
spot
on
the
cheek
that
was
nearest
to
me
fade
out
,
and
the
face
grow
pale
all
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
you
are
going
,
"
she
said
,
her
voice
almost
sinking
to
a
whisper
,
her
eyes
looking
more
and
more
intently
at
the
music
,
her
fingers
flying
over
the
keys
of
the
piano
with
a
strange
feverish
energy
which
I
had
never
noticed
in
her
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
remember
those
kind
words
,
Miss
Fairlie
,
long
after
to
-
morrow
has
come
and
gone
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
paleness
grew
whiter
on
her
face
,
and
she
turned
it
farther
away
from
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
speak
of
to
-
morrow
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Let
the
music
speak
to
us
of
to
-
night
,
in
a
happier
language
than
ours
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
lips
trembled
 
a
faint
sigh
fluttered
from
them
,
which
she
tried
vainly
to
suppress
.
<EOS>
Her
fingers
wavered
on
the
piano
 
<EOS>
she
struck
a
false
note
,
confused
herself
in
trying
to
set
it
right
,
and
dropped
her
hands
angrily
on
her
lap
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
and
Mr.
Gilmore
looked
up
in
astonishment
from
the
card
-
table
at
which
they
were
playing
.
<EOS>
Even
Mrs.
Vesey
,
dozing
in
her
chair
,
woke
at
the
sudden
cessation
of
the
music
,
and
inquired
what
had
happened
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
play
at
whist
,
Mr.
Hartright
?
"
asked
Miss
Halcombe
,
with
her
eyes
directed
significantly
at
the
place
I
occupied
.
  
<EOS>
I
knew
what
she
meant
 
<EOS>
I
knew
she
was
right
,
and
I
rose
at
once
to
go
to
the
card
-
table
.
<EOS>
As
I
left
the
piano
Miss
Fairlie
turned
a
page
of
the
music
,
and
touched
the
keys
again
with
a
surer
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
WILL
play
it
,
"
she
said
,
striking
the
notes
almost
passionately
.
<EOS>
"
I
WILL
play
it
on
the
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
,
Mrs.
Vesey
,
"
said
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
Mr.
Gilmore
and
I
are
tired
of
ecarte
 
come
and
be
Mr.
Hartright
's
partner
at
whist
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
lawyer
smiled
satirically
.
<EOS>
His
had
been
the
winning
hand
,
and
he
had
just
turned
up
a
king
.
<EOS>
He
evidently
attributed
Miss
Halcombe
's
abrupt
change
in
the
card
-
table
arrangements
to
a
lady
's
inability
to
play
the
losing
game
.
  
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
evening
passed
without
a
word
or
a
look
from
her
.
<EOS>
She
kept
her
place
at
the
piano
,
and
I
kept
mine
at
the
card
-
table
.
<EOS>
She
played
unintermittingly
 
played
as
if
the
music
was
her
only
refuge
from
herself
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
her
fingers
touched
the
notes
with
a
lingering
fondness
 
a
soft
,
plaintive
,
dying
tenderness
,
unutterably
beautiful
and
mournful
to
hear
;
sometimes
they
faltered
and
failed
her
,
or
hurried
over
the
instrument
mechanically
,
as
if
their
task
was
a
burden
to
them
.
<EOS>
But
still
,
change
and
waver
as
they
might
in
the
expression
they
imparted
to
the
music
,
their
resolution
to
play
never
faltered
.
<EOS>
She
only
rose
from
the
piano
when
we
all
rose
to
say
Good
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vesey
was
the
nearest
to
the
door
,
and
the
first
to
shake
hands
with
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
see
you
again
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
"
said
the
old
lady
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
truly
sorry
you
are
going
away
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
very
kind
and
attentive
,
and
an
old
woman
like
me
feels
kindness
and
attention
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
happy
,
sir
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
a
kind
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Gilmore
came
next
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
we
shall
have
a
future
opportunity
of
bettering
our
acquaintance
,
Mr.
Hartright
.
<EOS>
You
quite
understand
about
that
little
matter
of
business
being
safe
in
my
hands
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
Bless
me
,
how
cold
it
is
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
me
keep
you
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
Bon
voyage
,
my
dear
sir
 
bon
voyage
,
as
the
French
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
Miss
Halcombe
followed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Half
-
past
seven
to
-
morrow
morning
,
"
she
said
 
then
added
in
a
whisper
,
"
I
have
heard
and
seen
more
than
you
think
.
<EOS>
Your
conduct
to
-
night
has
made
me
your
friend
for
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
came
last
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
trust
myself
to
look
at
her
when
I
took
her
hand
,
and
when
I
thought
of
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
departure
must
be
a
very
early
one
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
gone
,
Miss
Fairlie
,
before
you
 
"
  
"
No
,
no
,
"
she
interposed
hastily
,
"
not
before
I
am
out
of
my
room
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
down
to
breakfast
with
Marian
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
so
ungrateful
,
not
so
forgetful
of
the
past
three
months
 
"
  
Her
voice
failed
her
,
her
hand
closed
gently
round
mine
 
then
dropped
it
suddenly
.
<EOS>
Before
I
could
say
"
Good
-
night
"
she
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
The
end
comes
fast
to
meet
me
 
comes
inevitably
,
as
the
light
of
the
last
morning
came
at
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
barely
half
-
past
seven
when
I
went
downstairs
,
but
I
found
them
both
at
the
breakfast
-
table
waiting
for
me
.
<EOS>
In
the
chill
air
,
in
the
dim
light
,
in
the
gloomy
morning
silence
of
the
house
,
we
three
sat
down
together
,
and
tried
to
eat
,
tried
to
talk
.
<EOS>
The
struggle
to
preserve
appearances
was
hopeless
and
useless
,
and
I
rose
to
end
it
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
held
out
my
hand
,
as
Miss
Halcombe
,
who
was
nearest
to
me
,
took
it
,
Miss
Fairlie
turned
away
suddenly
and
hurried
from
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Better
so
,
"
said
Miss
Halcombe
,
when
the
door
had
closed
 
"
better
so
,
for
you
and
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
waited
a
moment
before
I
could
speak
 
<EOS>
it
was
hard
to
lose
her
,
without
a
parting
word
or
a
parting
look
.
<EOS>
I
controlled
myself
 
<EOS>
I
tried
to
take
leave
of
Miss
Halcombe
in
fitting
terms
;
but
all
the
farewell
words
I
would
fain
have
spoken
dwindled
to
one
sentence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
I
deserved
that
you
should
write
to
me
?
<EOS>
"
was
all
I
could
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
nobly
deserved
everything
that
I
can
do
for
you
,
as
long
as
we
both
live
.
<EOS>
Whatever
the
end
is
you
shall
know
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
I
can
ever
be
of
help
again
,
at
any
future
time
,
long
after
the
memory
of
my
presumption
and
my
folly
is
forgotten
.
.
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
could
add
no
more
.
<EOS>
My
voice
faltered
,
my
eyes
moistened
in
spite
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
She
caught
me
by
both
hands
 
<EOS>
she
pressed
them
with
the
strong
,
steady
grasp
of
a
man
 
<EOS>
her
dark
eyes
glittered
 
her
brown
complexion
flushed
deep
 
the
force
and
energy
of
her
face
glowed
and
grew
beautiful
with
the
pure
inner
light
of
her
generosity
and
her
pity
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
trust
you
 
if
ever
the
time
comes
I
will
trust
you
as
my
friend
and
HER
friend
,
as
my
brother
and
HER
brother
.
"
<EOS>
She
stopped
,
drew
me
nearer
to
her
 
the
fearless
,
noble
creature
 
<EOS>
touched
my
forehead
,
sister
-
like
,
with
her
lips
,
and
called
me
by
my
Christian
name
.
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
Walter
!
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Wait
here
alone
and
compose
yourself
 
<EOS>
I
had
better
not
stay
for
both
our
sakes
 
<EOS>
I
had
better
see
you
go
from
the
balcony
upstairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
I
turned
away
towards
the
window
,
where
nothing
faced
me
but
<EOS>
the
lonely
autumn
landscape
 
<EOS>
I
turned
away
to
master
myself
,
before
I
too
left
the
room
in
my
turn
,
and
left
it
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
A
minute
passed
 
it
could
hardly
have
been
more
 
when
I
heard
the
door
open
again
softly
,
and
the
rustling
of
a
woman
's
dress
on
the
carpet
moved
towards
me
.
<EOS>
My
heart
beat
violently
as
I
turned
round
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
was
approaching
me
from
the
farther
end
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
She
stopped
and
hesitated
when
our
eyes
met
,
and
when
she
saw
that
we
were
alone
.
<EOS>
Then
,
with
that
courage
which
women
lose
so
often
in
the
small
emergency
,
and
so
seldom
in
the
great
,
she
came
on
nearer
to
me
,
strangely
pale
and
strangely
quiet
,
drawing
one
hand
after
her
along
the
table
by
which
she
walked
,
and
holding
something
at
her
side
in
the
other
,
which
was
hidden
by
the
folds
of
her
dress
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
went
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
"
she
said
,
"
to
look
for
this
.
<EOS>
It
may
remind
you
of
your
visit
here
,
and
of
the
friends
you
leave
behind
you
.
<EOS>
You
told
me
I
had
improved
very
much
when
I
did
it
,
and
I
thought
you
might
like
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
turned
her
head
away
,
and
offered
me
a
little
sketch
,
drawn
throughout
by
her
own
pencil
,
of
the
summer
-
house
in
which
we
had
first
met
.
<EOS>
The
paper
trembled
in
her
hand
as
she
held
it
out
to
me
 
trembled
in
mine
as
I
took
it
from
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
to
say
what
I
felt
 
<EOS>
I
only
answered
,
"
It
shall
never
leave
me
 
all
my
life
long
it
shall
be
the
treasure
that
I
prize
most
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
grateful
for
it
 
very
grateful
to
you
,
for
not
letting
me
go
away
without
bidding
you
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
she
said
innocently
,
"
how
could
I
let
you
go
,
after
we
have
passed
so
many
happy
days
together
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Those
days
may
never
return
,
Miss
Fairlie
 
<EOS>
my
way
of
life
<EOS>
and
yours
are
very
far
apart
.
<EOS>
But
if
a
time
should
come
,
when
the
devotion
of
my
whole
heart
and
soul
and
strength
will
give
you
a
moment
's
happiness
,
or
spare
you
a
moment
's
sorrow
,
will
you
try
to
remember
the
poor
drawing
-
master
who
has
taught
you
?
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
has
promised
to
trust
me
 
<EOS>
will
you
promise
too
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
farewell
sadness
in
the
kind
blue
eyes
shone
dimly
through
her
gathering
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
promise
it
,
"
she
said
in
broken
tones
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
n't
look
at
me
like
that
!
<EOS>
I
promise
it
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
ventured
a
little
nearer
to
her
,
and
held
out
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
many
friends
who
love
you
,
Miss
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
Your
happy
future
is
the
dear
object
of
many
hopes
.
<EOS>
May
I
say
,
at
parting
,
that
it
is
the
dear
object
of
MY
hopes
too
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
tears
flowed
fast
down
her
cheeks
.
<EOS>
She
rested
one
trembling
hand
on
the
table
to
steady
herself
while
she
gave
me
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
took
it
in
mine
 
<EOS>
I
held
it
fast
.
<EOS>
My
head
drooped
over
it
,
my
tears
fell
on
it
,
my
lips
pressed
it
 
not
in
love
;
oh
,
not
in
love
,
at
that
last
moment
,
but
in
the
agony
and
the
self
-
abandonment
of
despair
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
God
's
sake
,
leave
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
faintly
.
  
<EOS>
The
confession
of
her
heart
's
secret
burst
from
her
in
those
pleading
words
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
right
to
hear
them
,
no
right
to
answer
them
 
<EOS>
they
were
the
words
that
banished
me
,
in
the
name
of
her
sacred
weakness
,
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
over
.
<EOS>
I
dropped
her
hand
,
I
said
no
more
.
<EOS>
The
blinding
tears
shut
her
out
from
my
eyes
,
and
I
dashed
them
away
to
look
at
her
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
One
look
as
she
sank
into
a
chair
,
as
her
arms
fell
on
the
table
,
as
her
fair
head
dropped
on
them
wearily
.
<EOS>
One
farewell
look
,
and
the
door
had
closed
upon
her
 
the
great
gulf
of
separation
had
opened
between
us
 
<EOS>
the
image
of
Laura
Fairlie
was
a
memory
of
the
past
already
.
  
<EOS>
The
End
of
Hartright
's
Narrative
.
  
<EOS>
THE
STORY
CONTINUED
BY
<EOS>
VINCENT
GILMORE
  
(
of
Chancery
Lane
,
Solicitor
)
      
<EOS>
I
write
these
lines
at
the
request
of
my
friend
,
Mr.
Walter
Hartright
.
<EOS>
They
are
intended
to
convey
a
description
of
certain
events
which
seriously
affected
Miss
Fairlie
's
interests
,
and
which
took
place
after
the
period
of
Mr.
Hartright
's
departure
from
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
no
need
for
me
to
say
whether
my
own
opinion
does
or
does
not
sanction
the
disclosure
of
the
remarkable
family
story
,
of
which
my
narrative
forms
an
important
component
part
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Hartright
has
taken
that
responsibility
on
himself
,
and
circumstances
yet
to
be
related
will
show
that
he
has
amply
earned
the
right
to
do
so
,
if
he
chooses
to
exercise
it
.
<EOS>
The
plan
he
has
adopted
for
presenting
the
story
to
others
,
in
the
most
truthful
and
most
vivid
manner
,
requires
that
it
should
be
told
,
at
each
successive
stage
in
the
march
of
events
,
by
the
persons
who
were
directly
concerned
in
those
events
at
the
time
of
their
occurrence
.
<EOS>
My
appearance
here
,
as
narrator
,
is
the
necessary
consequence
of
this
arrangement
.
<EOS>
I
was
present
during
the
sojourn
of
Sir
Percival
Glyde
in
Cumberland
,
and
was
personally
concerned
in
one
important
result
of
his
short
residence
under
Mr.
Fairlie
's
roof
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
duty
,
therefore
,
to
add
these
new
links
to
the
chain
of
events
,
and
to
take
up
the
chain
itself
at
the
point
where
,
for
the
present
only
Mr.
Hartright
has
dropped
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
arrived
at
Limmeridge
House
on
Friday
the
second
of
November
.
  
<EOS>
My
object
was
to
remain
at
Mr.
Fairlie
's
until
the
arrival
of
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
If
that
event
led
to
the
appointment
of
any
given
day
for
Sir
Percival
's
union
with
Miss
Fairlie
,
I
was
to
take
the
necessary
instructions
back
with
me
to
London
,
and
to
occupy
myself
in
drawing
the
lady
's
marriage
-
settlement
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
Friday
I
was
not
favoured
by
Mr.
Fairlie
with
an
interview
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
,
or
had
fancied
himself
to
be
,
an
invalid
for
years
past
,
and
he
was
not
well
enough
to
receive
me
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
was
the
first
member
of
the
family
whom
I
saw
.
<EOS>
She
met
me
at
the
house
door
,
and
introduced
me
to
Mr.
Hartright
,
who
had
been
staying
at
Limmeridge
for
some
time
past
.
  
<EOS>
I
did
not
see
Miss
Fairlie
until
later
in
the
day
,
at
dinner
-
time
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
looking
well
,
and
I
was
sorry
to
observe
it
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
sweet
lovable
girl
,
as
amiable
and
attentive
to
every
one
about
her
as
her
excellent
mother
used
to
be
 
though
,
personally
speaking
,
she
takes
after
her
father
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairlie
had
dark
eyes
and
hair
,
and
her
elder
daughter
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
strongly
reminds
me
of
her
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
played
to
us
in
the
evening
 
not
so
well
as
usual
,
I
thought
.
<EOS>
We
had
a
rubber
at
whist
,
a
mere
profanation
,
so
far
as
play
was
concerned
,
of
that
noble
game
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
favourably
impressed
by
Mr.
Hartright
on
our
first
introduction
to
one
another
,
but
I
soon
discovered
that
he
was
not
free
from
the
social
failings
incidental
to
his
age
.
<EOS>
There
are
three
things
that
none
of
the
young
men
of
the
present
generation
can
do
.
<EOS>
They
ca
n't
sit
over
their
wine
,
they
ca
n't
play
at
whist
,
and
they
ca
n't
pay
a
lady
a
compliment
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Hartright
was
no
exception
to
the
general
rule
.
<EOS>
Otherwise
,
even
in
those
early
days
and
on
that
short
acquaintance
,
he
struck
me
as
being
a
modest
and
gentlemanlike
young
man
.
  
<EOS>
So
the
Friday
passed
.
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
about
the
more
serious
matters
which
engaged
my
attention
on
that
day
 
the
anonymous
letter
to
Miss
Fairlie
,
the
measures
I
thought
it
right
to
adopt
when
the
matter
was
mentioned
to
me
,
and
the
conviction
I
entertained
that
every
possible
explanation
of
the
circumstances
would
be
readily
afforded
by
Sir
Percival
Glyde
,
having
all
been
fully
noticed
,
as
I
understand
,
in
the
narrative
which
precedes
this
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
Saturday
Mr.
Hartright
had
left
before
I
got
down
to
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
kept
her
room
all
day
,
and
Miss
Halcombe
appeared
to
me
to
be
out
of
spirits
.
<EOS>
The
house
was
not
what
it
used
to
be
in
the
time
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Philip
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
I
took
a
walk
by
myself
in
the
forenoon
,
and
looked
about
at
some
of
the
places
which
I
first
saw
when
I
was
staying
at
Limmeridge
to
transact
family
business
,
more
than
thirty
years
since
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
what
they
used
to
be
either
.
  
<EOS>
At
two
o'clock
Mr.
Fairlie
sent
to
say
he
was
well
enough
to
see
me
.
<EOS>
HE
had
not
altered
,
at
any
rate
,
since
I
first
knew
him
.
<EOS>
His
talk
was
to
the
same
purpose
as
usual
 
all
about
himself
and
his
ailments
,
his
wonderful
coins
,
and
his
matchless
Rembrandt
etchings
.
<EOS>
The
moment
I
tried
to
speak
of
the
business
that
had
brought
me
to
his
house
,
he
shut
his
eyes
and
said
I
"
upset
"
him
.
<EOS>
I
persisted
in
upsetting
him
by
returning
again
and
again
to
the
subject
.
<EOS>
All
I
could
ascertain
was
that
he
looked
on
his
niece
's
marriage
as
a
settled
thing
,
that
her
father
had
sanctioned
it
,
that
he
sanctioned
it
himself
,
that
it
was
a
desirable
marriage
,
and
that
he
should
be
personally
rejoiced
when
the
worry
of
it
was
over
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
settlements
,
if
I
would
consult
his
niece
,
and
afterwards
dive
as
deeply
as
I
pleased
into
my
own
knowledge
of
the
family
affairs
,
and
get
everything
ready
,
and
limit
his
share
in
the
business
,
as
guardian
,
to
saying
Yes
,
at
the
right
moment
 
why
,
of
course
he
would
meet
my
views
,
and
everybody
else
's
views
,
with
infinite
pleasure
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
there
I
saw
him
,
a
helpless
sufferer
,
confined
to
his
room
.
<EOS>
Did
I
think
he
looked
as
if
he
wanted
teasing
?
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Then
why
tease
him
?
  
<EOS>
I
might
,
perhaps
,
have
been
a
little
astonished
at
this
extraordinary
absence
of
all
self
-
assertion
on
Mr.
Fairlie
's
part
,
in
the
character
of
guardian
,
if
my
knowledge
of
the
family
affairs
had
not
been
sufficient
to
remind
me
that
he
was
a
single
man
,
and
that
he
had
nothing
more
than
a
life
-
interest
in
the
Limmeridge
property
.
<EOS>
As
matters
stood
,
therefore
,
I
was
neither
surprised
nor
disappointed
at
the
result
of
the
interview
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
had
simply
justified
my
expectations
 
<EOS>
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Sunday
was
a
dull
day
,
out
of
doors
and
in
.
<EOS>
A
letter
arrived
for
me
from
Sir
Percival
Glyde
's
solicitor
,
acknowledging
the
receipt
of
my
copy
of
the
anonymous
letter
and
my
accompanying
statement
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
joined
us
in
the
afternoon
,
looking
pale
and
depressed
,
and
altogether
unlike
herself
.
<EOS>
I
had
some
talk
with
her
,
and
ventured
on
a
delicate
allusion
to
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
She
listened
and
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
All
other
subjects
she
pursued
willingly
,
but
this
subject
she
allowed
to
drop
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
doubt
whether
she
might
not
be
repenting
of
her
engagement
 
just
as
young
ladies
often
do
,
when
repentance
comes
too
late
.
  
<EOS>
On
Monday
Sir
Percival
Glyde
arrived
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
him
to
be
a
most
prepossessing
man
,
so
far
as
manners
and
appearance
were
concerned
.
<EOS>
He
looked
rather
older
than
I
had
expected
,
his
head
being
bald
over
the
forehead
,
and
his
face
somewhat
marked
and
worn
,
but
his
movements
were
as
active
and
his
spirits
as
high
as
a
young
man
's
.
<EOS>
His
meeting
with
Miss
Halcombe
was
delightfully
hearty
and
unaffected
,
and
his
reception
of
me
,
upon
my
being
presented
to
him
,
was
so
easy
and
pleasant
that
we
got
on
together
like
old
friends
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
was
not
with
us
when
he
arrived
,
but
she
entered
the
room
about
ten
minutes
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
rose
and
paid
his
compliments
with
perfect
grace
.
<EOS>
His
evident
concern
on
seeing
the
change
for
the
worse
in
the
young
lady
's
looks
was
expressed
with
a
mixture
of
tenderness
and
respect
,
with
an
unassuming
delicacy
of
tone
,
voice
,
and
manner
,
which
did
equal
credit
to
his
good
breeding
and
his
good
sense
.
<EOS>
I
was
rather
surprised
,
under
these
circumstances
,
to
see
that
Miss
Fairlie
continued
to
be
constrained
and
uneasy
in
his
presence
,
and
that
she
took
the
first
opportunity
of
leaving
the
room
again
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
neither
noticed
the
restraint
in
her
reception
of
him
,
nor
her
sudden
withdrawal
from
our
society
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
obtruded
his
attentions
on
her
while
she
was
present
,
and
he
did
not
embarrass
Miss
Halcombe
by
any
allusion
to
her
departure
when
she
was
gone
.
<EOS>
His
tact
and
taste
were
never
at
fault
on
this
or
on
any
other
occasion
while
I
was
in
his
company
at
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Miss
Fairlie
had
left
the
room
he
spared
us
all
embarrassment
on
the
subject
of
the
anonymous
letter
,
by
adverting
to
it
of
his
own
accord
.
<EOS>
He
had
stopped
in
London
on
his
way
from
Hampshire
,
had
seen
his
solicitor
,
had
read
the
documents
forwarded
by
me
,
and
had
travelled
on
to
Cumberland
,
anxious
to
satisfy
our
minds
by
the
speediest
and
the
fullest
explanation
that
words
could
convey
.
<EOS>
On
hearing
him
express
himself
to
this
effect
,
I
offered
him
the
original
letter
,
which
I
had
kept
for
his
inspection
.
<EOS>
He
thanked
me
,
and
declined
to
look
at
it
,
saying
that
he
had
seen
the
copy
,
and
that
he
was
quite
willing
to
leave
the
original
in
our
hands
.
  
<EOS>
The
statement
itself
,
on
which
he
immediately
entered
,
was
as
simple
and
satisfactory
as
I
had
all
along
anticipated
it
would
be
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Catherick
,
he
informed
us
,
had
in
past
years
laid
him
under
some
obligations
for
faithful
services
rendered
to
his
family
connections
and
to
himself
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
doubly
unfortunate
in
being
married
to
a
husband
who
had
deserted
her
,
and
in
having
an
only
child
whose
mental
faculties
had
been
in
a
disturbed
condition
from
a
very
early
age
.
<EOS>
Although
her
marriage
had
removed
her
to
a
part
of
Hampshire
far
distant
from
the
neighbourhood
in
which
Sir
Percival
's
property
was
situated
,
he
had
taken
care
not
to
lose
sight
of
her
 
his
friendly
feeling
towards
the
poor
woman
,
in
consideration
of
her
past
services
,
having
been
greatly
strengthened
by
his
admiration
of
the
patience
and
courage
with
which
she
supported
her
calamities
.
<EOS>
In
course
of
time
the
symptoms
of
mental
affliction
in
her
unhappy
daughter
increased
to
such
a
serious
extent
,
as
to
make
it
a
matter
of
necessity
to
place
her
under
proper
medical
care
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Catherick
herself
recognised
this
necessity
,
but
she
also
felt
the
prejudice
common
to
persons
occupying
her
respectable
station
,
against
allowing
her
child
to
be
admitted
,
as
a
pauper
,
into
a
public
Asylum
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
had
respected
this
prejudice
,
as
he
respected
honest
independence
of
feeling
in
any
rank
of
life
,
and
had
resolved
to
mark
his
grateful
sense
of
Mrs.
Catherick
's
early
attachment
to
the
interests
of
himself
and
his
family
,
by
defraying
the
expense
of
her
daughter
's
maintenance
in
a
trustworthy
private
Asylum
.
<EOS>
To
her
mother
's
regret
,
and
to
his
own
regret
,
the
unfortunate
creature
had
discovered
the
share
which
circumstances
had
induced
him
to
take
in
placing
her
under
restraint
,
and
had
conceived
the
most
intense
hatred
and
distrust
of
him
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
To
that
hatred
and
distrust
 
which
had
expressed
itself
in
various
ways
in
the
Asylum
 
<EOS>
the
anonymous
letter
,
written
after
her
escape
,
was
plainly
attributable
.
<EOS>
If
Miss
Halcombe
's
or
Mr.
Gilmore
's
recollection
of
the
document
did
not
confirm
that
view
,
or
if
they
wished
for
any
additional
particulars
about
the
Asylum
(
the
address
of
which
he
mentioned
,
as
well
as
the
names
and
addresses
of
the
two
doctors
on
whose
certificates
the
patient
was
admitted
)
,
he
was
ready
to
answer
any
question
and
to
clear
up
any
uncertainty
.
<EOS>
He
had
done
his
duty
to
the
unhappy
young
woman
,
by
instructing
his
solicitor
to
spare
no
expense
in
tracing
her
,
and
in
restoring
her
once
more
to
medical
care
,
and
he
was
now
only
anxious
to
do
his
duty
towards
Miss
Fairlie
and
towards
her
family
,
in
the
same
plain
,
straightforward
way
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
the
first
to
speak
in
answer
to
this
appeal
.
<EOS>
My
own
course
was
plain
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
great
beauty
of
the
Law
that
it
can
dispute
any
human
statement
,
made
under
any
circumstances
,
and
reduced
to
any
form
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
felt
professionally
called
upon
to
set
up
a
case
against
Sir
Percival
Glyde
,
on
the
strength
of
his
own
explanation
,
I
could
have
done
so
beyond
all
doubt
.
<EOS>
But
my
duty
did
not
lie
in
this
direction
 
<EOS>
my
function
was
of
the
purely
judicial
kind
.
<EOS>
I
was
to
weigh
the
explanation
we
had
just
heard
,
to
allow
all
due
force
to
the
high
reputation
of
the
gentleman
who
offered
it
,
and
to
decide
honestly
whether
the
probabilities
,
on
Sir
Percival
's
own
showing
,
were
plainly
with
him
,
or
plainly
against
him
.
<EOS>
My
own
conviction
was
that
they
were
plainly
with
him
,
and
I
accordingly
declared
that
his
explanation
was
,
to
my
mind
,
unquestionably
a
satisfactory
one
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
,
after
looking
at
me
very
earnestly
,
said
a
few
words
,
on
her
side
,
to
the
same
effect
 
with
a
certain
hesitation
of
manner
,
however
,
which
the
circumstances
did
not
seem
to
me
to
warrant
.
<EOS>
I
am
unable
to
say
,
positively
,
whether
Sir
Percival
noticed
this
or
not
.
<EOS>
My
opinion
is
that
he
did
,
seeing
that
he
pointedly
resumed
the
subject
,
although
he
might
now
,
with
all
propriety
,
have
allowed
it
to
drop
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
my
plain
statement
of
facts
had
only
been
addressed
to
Mr.
Gilmore
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
should
consider
any
further
reference
to
this
unhappy
matter
as
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
I
may
fairly
expect
Mr.
Gilmore
,
as
a
gentleman
,
to
believe
me
on
my
word
,
and
when
he
has
done
me
that
justice
,
all
discussion
of
the
subject
between
us
has
come
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
But
my
position
with
a
lady
is
not
the
same
.
<EOS>
I
owe
to
her
 
what
I
would
concede
to
no
man
alive
 
a
PROOF
of
the
truth
of
my
assertion
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
ask
for
that
proof
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
and
it
is
therefore
my
duty
to
you
,
and
still
more
to
Miss
Fairlie
,
to
offer
it
.
<EOS>
May
I
beg
that
you
will
write
at
once
to
the
mother
of
this
unfortunate
woman
 
to
Mrs.
Catherick
 
to
ask
for
her
testimony
in
support
of
the
explanation
which
I
have
just
offered
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
saw
Miss
Halcombe
change
colour
,
and
look
a
little
uneasy
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
's
suggestion
,
politely
as
it
was
expressed
,
appeared
to
her
,
as
it
appeared
to
me
,
to
point
very
delicately
at
the
hesitation
which
her
manner
had
betrayed
a
moment
or
two
since
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
Sir
Percival
,
you
do
n't
do
me
the
injustice
to
suppose
that
I
distrust
you
,
"
she
said
quickly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
I
make
my
proposal
purely
as
an
act
of
attention
to
YOU
.
<EOS>
Will
you
excuse
my
obstinacy
if
I
still
venture
to
press
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
walked
to
the
writing
-
table
as
he
spoke
,
drew
a
chair
to
it
,
and
opened
the
paper
case
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
beg
you
to
write
the
note
,
"
he
said
,
"
as
a
favour
to
ME
.
<EOS>
It
need
not
occupy
you
more
than
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
You
have
only
to
ask
Mrs.
Catherick
two
questions
.
<EOS>
First
,
if
her
daughter
was
placed
in
the
Asylum
with
her
knowledge
and
approval
.
<EOS>
Secondly
,
if
the
share
I
took
in
the
matter
was
such
as
to
merit
the
expression
of
her
gratitude
towards
myself
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Gilmore
's
mind
is
at
ease
on
this
unpleasant
subject
,
and
your
mind
is
at
ease
 
<EOS>
pray
set
my
mind
at
ease
also
by
writing
the
note
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
oblige
me
to
grant
your
request
,
Sir
Percival
,
when
I
would
much
rather
refuse
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
those
words
Miss
Halcombe
rose
from
her
place
and
went
to
the
writing
-
table
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
thanked
her
,
handed
her
a
pen
,
and
then
walked
away
towards
the
fireplace
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
's
little
Italian
greyhound
was
lying
on
the
rug
.
<EOS>
He
held
out
his
hand
,
and
called
to
the
dog
good
-
humouredly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Nina
,
"
he
said
,
"
we
remember
each
other
,
do
n't
we
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
little
beast
,
cowardly
and
cross
-
grained
,
as
pet
-
dogs
usually
are
,
looked
up
at
him
sharply
,
shrank
away
from
his
outstretched
hand
,
whined
,
shivered
,
and
hid
itself
under
a
sofa
.
<EOS>
It
was
scarcely
possible
that
he
could
have
been
put
out
by
such
a
trifle
as
a
dog
's
reception
of
him
,
but
I
observed
,
nevertheless
,
that
he
walked
away
towards
the
window
very
suddenly
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
his
temper
is
irritable
at
times
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
I
can
sympathise
with
him
.
<EOS>
My
temper
is
irritable
at
times
too
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
was
not
long
in
writing
the
note
.
<EOS>
When
it
was
done
she
rose
from
the
writing
-
table
,
and
handed
the
open
sheet
of
paper
to
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
He
bowed
,
took
it
from
her
,
folded
it
up
immediately
without
looking
at
the
contents
,
sealed
it
,
wrote
the
address
,
and
handed
it
back
to
her
in
silence
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
anything
more
gracefully
and
more
becomingly
done
in
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
insist
on
my
posting
this
letter
,
Sir
Percival
?
"
said
Miss
Halcombe
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
you
will
post
it
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
And
now
that
it
is
written
and
sealed
up
,
allow
me
to
ask
one
or
two
last
questions
about
the
unhappy
woman
to
whom
it
refers
.
<EOS>
I
have
read
the
communication
which
Mr.
Gilmore
kindly
addressed
to
my
solicitor
,
describing
the
circumstances
under
which
the
writer
of
the
anonymous
letter
was
identified
.
<EOS>
But
there
are
certain
points
to
which
that
statement
does
not
refer
.
<EOS>
Did
Anne
Catherick
see
Miss
Fairlie
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
not
,
"
replied
Miss
Halcombe
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
she
see
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
saw
nobody
from
the
house
then
,
except
a
certain
Mr.
Hartright
,
who
accidentally
met
with
her
in
the
churchyard
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nobody
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Hartright
was
employed
at
Limmeridge
as
a
drawing
-
master
,
I
believe
?
<EOS>
Is
he
a
member
of
one
of
the
Water
-
Colour
Societies
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
he
is
,
"
answered
Miss
Halcombe
.
  
<EOS>
He
paused
for
a
moment
,
as
if
he
was
thinking
over
the
last
answer
,
and
then
added
    
<EOS>
"
Did
you
find
out
where
Anne
Catherick
was
living
,
when
she
was
in
this
neighbourhood
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
At
a
farm
on
the
moor
,
called
Todd
's
Corner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
duty
we
all
owe
to
the
poor
creature
herself
to
trace
her
,
"
continued
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
"
She
may
have
said
something
at
Todd
's
Corner
which
may
help
us
to
find
her
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
there
and
make
inquiries
on
the
chance
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
as
I
can
not
prevail
on
myself
to
discuss
this
painful
subject
with
Miss
Fairlie
,
may
I
beg
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
that
you
will
kindly
undertake
to
give
her
the
necessary
explanation
,
deferring
it
of
course
until
you
have
received
the
reply
to
that
note
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
promised
to
comply
with
his
request
.
<EOS>
He
thanked
her
,
nodded
pleasantly
,
and
left
us
,
to
go
and
establish
himself
in
his
own
room
.
<EOS>
As
he
opened
the
door
the
cross
-
grained
greyhound
poked
out
her
sharp
muzzle
from
under
the
sofa
,
and
barked
and
snapped
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
good
morning
's
work
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
I
said
,
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
is
an
anxious
day
well
ended
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
answered
;
"
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
glad
your
mind
is
satisfied
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
mind
!
<EOS>
Surely
,
with
that
note
in
your
hand
,
your
mind
is
at
ease
too
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
 
how
can
it
be
otherwise
?
<EOS>
I
know
the
thing
could
not
be
,
"
she
went
on
,
speaking
more
to
herself
than
to
me
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
almost
wish
Walter
Hartright
had
stayed
here
long
enough
to
be
present
at
the
explanation
,
and
to
hear
the
proposal
to
me
to
write
this
note
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
a
little
surprised
 
perhaps
a
little
piqued
also
 
by
these
last
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Events
,
it
is
true
,
connected
Mr.
Hartright
very
remarkably
with
the
affair
of
the
letter
,
"
I
said
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
readily
admit
that
he
conducted
himself
,
<EOS>
all
things
considered
,
with
great
delicacy
and
discretion
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
quite
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
useful
influence
his
presence
could
have
exercised
in
relation
to
the
effect
of
Sir
Percival
's
statement
on
your
mind
or
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
only
a
fancy
,
"
she
said
absently
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
need
to
discuss
it
,
Mr.
Gilmore
.
<EOS>
Your
experience
ought
to
be
,
and
is
,
the
best
guide
I
can
desire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
did
not
altogether
like
her
thrusting
the
whole
responsibility
,
in
this
marked
manner
,
on
my
shoulders
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Fairlie
had
done
it
,
I
should
not
have
been
surprised
.
<EOS>
But
resolute
,
clear
-
minded
Miss
Halcombe
was
the
very
last
person
in
the
world
whom
I
should
have
expected
to
find
shrinking
from
the
expression
of
an
opinion
of
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
any
doubts
still
trouble
you
,
"
I
said
,
"
why
not
mention
them
to
me
at
once
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
plainly
,
have
you
any
reason
to
distrust
Sir
Percival
Glyde
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
whatever
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
see
anything
improbable
,
or
contradictory
,
in
his
explanation
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
say
I
do
,
after
the
proof
he
has
offered
me
of
the
truth
of
it
?
<EOS>
Can
there
be
better
testimony
in
his
favour
,
Mr.
Gilmore
,
than
the
testimony
of
the
woman
's
mother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
better
.
<EOS>
If
the
answer
to
your
note
of
inquiry
proves
to
be
satisfactory
,
I
for
one
can
not
see
what
more
any
friend
of
Sir
Percival
's
can
possibly
expect
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
we
will
post
the
note
,
"
she
said
,
rising
to
leave
the
room
,
"
and
dismiss
all
further
reference
to
the
subject
until
the
answer
arrives
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
attach
any
weight
to
my
hesitation
.
<EOS>
I
can
give
no
better
reason
for
it
than
that
I
have
been
over
-
anxious
about
Laura
lately
 
and
anxiety
,
Mr.
Gilmore
,
unsettles
the
strongest
of
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
left
me
abruptly
,
her
naturally
firm
voice
faltering
as
she
spoke
those
last
words
.
<EOS>
A
sensitive
,
vehement
,
passionate
nature
 
<EOS>
a
woman
of
ten
thousand
in
these
trivial
,
superficial
times
.
<EOS>
I
had
known
her
from
her
earliest
years
 
<EOS>
I
had
seen
her
tested
,
as
she
grew
up
,
in
more
than
one
trying
family
crisis
,
and
my
long
experience
made
me
attach
an
importance
to
her
hesitation
under
the
circumstances
here
detailed
,
which
I
should
certainly
not
have
felt
in
the
case
of
another
woman
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
no
cause
for
any
uneasiness
or
any
doubt
,
but
she
had
made
me
a
little
uneasy
,
and
a
little
doubtful
,
nevertheless
.
<EOS>
In
my
youth
,
I
should
have
chafed
and
fretted
under
the
irritation
of
my
own
unreasonable
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
In
my
age
,
I
knew
better
,
and
went
out
philosophically
to
walk
it
off
.
    
<EOS>
We
all
met
again
at
dinner
-
time
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
was
in
such
boisterous
high
spirits
that
I
hardly
recognised
him
as
the
same
man
whose
quiet
tact
,
refinement
,
and
good
sense
had
impressed
me
so
strongly
at
the
interview
of
the
morning
.
<EOS>
The
only
trace
of
his
former
self
that
I
could
detect
reappeared
,
every
now
and
then
,
in
his
manner
towards
Miss
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
A
look
or
a
word
from
her
suspended
his
loudest
laugh
,
checked
his
gayest
flow
of
talk
,
and
rendered
him
all
attention
to
her
,
and
to
no
one
else
at
table
,
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
Although
he
never
openly
tried
to
draw
her
into
the
conversation
,
he
never
lost
the
slightest
chance
she
gave
him
of
letting
her
drift
into
it
by
accident
,
and
of
saying
the
words
to
her
,
under
those
favourable
circumstances
,
which
a
man
with
less
tact
and
delicacy
would
have
pointedly
addressed
to
her
the
moment
they
occurred
to
him
.
<EOS>
Rather
to
my
surprise
,
Miss
Fairlie
appeared
to
be
sensible
of
his
attentions
without
being
moved
by
them
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
little
confused
from
time
to
time
when
he
looked
at
her
,
or
spoke
to
her
;
but
she
never
warmed
towards
him
.
<EOS>
Rank
,
fortune
,
good
breeding
,
good
looks
,
the
respect
of
a
gentleman
,
and
the
devotion
of
a
lover
were
all
humbly
placed
at
her
feet
,
and
,
so
far
as
appearances
went
,
were
all
offered
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
next
day
,
the
Tuesday
,
Sir
Percival
went
in
the
morning
(
taking
one
of
the
servants
with
him
as
a
guide
)
to
Todd
's
Corner
.
<EOS>
His
inquiries
,
as
I
afterwards
heard
,
led
to
no
results
.
<EOS>
On
his
return
he
had
an
interview
with
Mr.
Fairlie
,
and
in
the
afternoon
he
and
Miss
Halcombe
rode
out
together
.
<EOS>
Nothing
else
happened
worthy
of
record
.
<EOS>
The
evening
passed
as
usual
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
change
in
Sir
Percival
,
and
no
change
in
Miss
Fairlie
.
  
<EOS>
The
Wednesday
's
post
brought
with
it
an
event
 
<EOS>
the
reply
from
Mrs.
Catherick
.
<EOS>
I
took
a
copy
of
the
document
,
which
I
have
preserved
,
and
which
I
may
as
well
present
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
It
ran
as
follows
    
<EOS>
"
MADAM
,
 
<EOS>
I
beg
to
acknowledge
the
receipt
of
your
letter
,
inquiring
whether
my
daughter
,
Anne
,
was
placed
under
medical
superintendence
with
my
knowledge
and
approval
,
and
whether
the
share
taken
in
the
matter
by
Sir
Percival
Glyde
<EOS>
was
such
as
to
merit
the
expression
of
my
gratitude
towards
that
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Be
pleased
to
accept
my
answer
in
the
affirmative
to
both
those
questions
,
and
believe
me
to
remain
,
your
obedient
servant
,
  
"
JANE
ANNE
CATHERICK
.
<EOS>
"
  
Short
,
sharp
,
and
to
the
point
;
in
form
rather
a
business
-
like
letter
for
a
woman
to
write
 
in
substance
as
plain
a
confirmation
as
could
be
desired
of
Sir
Percival
Glyde
's
statement
.
<EOS>
This
was
my
opinion
,
and
with
certain
minor
reservations
,
Miss
Halcombe
's
opinion
also
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
,
when
the
letter
was
shown
to
him
,
did
not
appear
to
be
struck
by
the
sharp
,
short
tone
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
told
us
that
Mrs.
Catherick
was
a
woman
of
few
words
,
a
clear
-
headed
,
straightforward
,
unimaginative
person
,
who
wrote
briefly
and
plainly
,
just
as
she
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
duty
to
be
accomplished
,
now
that
the
answer
had
been
received
,
was
to
acquaint
Miss
Fairlie
with
Sir
Percival
's
explanation
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
had
undertaken
to
do
this
,
and
had
left
the
room
to
go
to
her
sister
,
when
she
suddenly
returned
again
,
and
sat
down
by
the
easy
-
chair
in
which
I
was
reading
the
newspaper
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
had
gone
out
a
minute
before
to
look
at
the
stables
,
and
no
one
was
in
the
room
but
ourselves
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
we
have
really
and
truly
done
all
we
can
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
turning
and
twisting
Mrs.
Catherick
's
letter
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
we
are
friends
of
Sir
Percival
's
,
who
know
him
and
trust
him
,
we
have
done
all
,
and
more
than
all
,
that
is
necessary
,
"
I
answered
,
a
little
annoyed
by
this
return
of
her
hesitation
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
we
are
enemies
who
suspect
him
 
"
  
"
That
alternative
is
not
even
to
be
thought
of
,
"
she
interposed
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
Sir
Percival
's
friends
,
and
if
generosity
and
forbearance
can
add
to
our
regard
for
him
,
we
ought
to
be
Sir
Percival
's
admirers
as
well
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
he
saw
Mr.
Fairlie
yesterday
,
and
that
he
afterwards
went
out
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
saw
you
riding
away
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
began
the
ride
by
talking
about
Anne
Catherick
,
and
about
the
singular
manner
in
which
Mr.
Hartright
met
with
her
.
<EOS>
But
we
soon
dropped
that
subject
,
and
Sir
Percival
spoke
next
,
in
the
most
unselfish
terms
,
of
his
engagement
with
Laura
.
<EOS>
He
said
he
had
observed
that
she
was
out
of
spirits
,
and
he
was
willing
,
if
not
informed
to
the
contrary
,
to
attribute
to
that
cause
the
alteration
in
her
manner
towards
him
during
his
present
visit
.
<EOS>
If
,
however
,
there
was
any
more
serious
reason
for
the
change
,
he
would
entreat
that
no
constraint
might
be
placed
on
her
inclinations
either
by
Mr.
Fairlie
or
by
me
.
<EOS>
All
he
asked
,
in
that
case
,
was
that
she
would
recall
to
mind
,
for
the
last
time
,
what
the
circumstances
were
under
which
the
engagement
between
them
was
made
,
and
what
his
conduct
had
been
from
the
beginning
of
the
courtship
to
the
present
time
.
<EOS>
If
,
after
due
reflection
on
those
two
subjects
,
she
seriously
desired
that
he
should
withdraw
his
pretensions
to
the
honour
of
becoming
her
husband
 
<EOS>
and
if
she
would
tell
him
so
plainly
with
her
own
lips
 
he
would
sacrifice
himself
by
leaving
her
perfectly
free
to
withdraw
from
the
engagement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
man
could
say
more
than
that
,
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
As
to
my
experience
,
few
men
in
his
situation
would
have
said
as
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
paused
after
I
had
spoken
those
words
,
and
looked
at
me
with
a
singular
expression
of
perplexity
and
distress
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
accuse
nobody
,
and
I
suspect
nothing
,
"
she
broke
out
abruptly
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
can
not
and
will
not
accept
the
responsibility
of
persuading
Laura
to
this
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
exactly
the
course
<EOS>
which
Sir
Percival
Glyde
has
himself
requested
you
to
take
,
"
I
replied
in
astonishment
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
begged
you
not
to
force
her
inclinations
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
indirectly
obliges
me
to
force
them
,
if
I
give
her
his
message
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
that
possibly
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Consult
your
own
knowledge
of
Laura
,
Mr.
Gilmore
.
<EOS>
If
I
tell
her
to
reflect
on
the
circumstances
of
her
engagement
,
I
at
once
appeal
to
two
of
the
strongest
feelings
in
her
nature
 
to
her
love
for
her
father
's
memory
,
and
to
her
strict
regard
for
truth
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
she
never
broke
a
promise
in
her
life
 
<EOS>
you
know
that
she
entered
on
this
engagement
at
the
beginning
of
her
father
's
fatal
illness
,
and
that
he
spoke
hopefully
and
happily
of
her
marriage
to
Sir
Percival
Glyde
on
his
deathbed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
own
that
I
was
a
little
shocked
at
this
view
of
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
"
I
said
,
"
you
do
n't
mean
to
infer
that
when
Sir
Percival
spoke
to
you
yesterday
he
speculated
on
such
a
result
as
you
have
just
mentioned
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
frank
,
fearless
face
answered
for
her
before
she
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
I
would
remain
an
instant
in
the
company
of
any
man
whom
I
suspected
of
such
baseness
as
that
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
angrily
.
  
<EOS>
I
liked
to
feel
her
hearty
indignation
flash
out
on
me
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
We
see
so
much
malice
and
so
little
indignation
in
my
profession
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
,
"
I
said
,
"
excuse
me
if
I
tell
you
,
in
our
legal
phrase
,
that
you
are
travelling
out
of
the
record
.
<EOS>
Whatever
the
consequences
may
be
,
Sir
Percival
has
a
right
to
expect
that
your
sister
should
carefully
consider
her
engagement
from
every
reasonable
point
of
view
before
she
claims
her
release
from
it
.
<EOS>
If
that
unlucky
letter
has
prejudiced
her
against
him
,
go
at
once
,
and
tell
her
that
he
has
cleared
himself
in
your
eyes
and
in
mine
.
<EOS>
What
objection
can
she
urge
against
him
after
that
?
<EOS>
What
excuse
can
she
possibly
have
for
changing
her
mind
about
a
man
whom
she
had
virtually
accepted
for
her
husband
more
than
two
years
ago
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
eyes
of
law
and
reason
,
Mr.
Gilmore
,
no
excuse
,
I
daresay
.
<EOS>
If
she
still
hesitates
,
and
if
I
still
hesitate
,
you
must
attribute
our
strange
conduct
,
if
you
like
,
to
caprice
in
both
cases
,
and
we
must
bear
the
imputation
as
well
as
we
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
those
words
she
suddenly
rose
and
left
me
.
<EOS>
When
a
sensible
woman
has
a
serious
question
put
to
her
,
and
evades
it
by
a
flippant
answer
,
it
is
a
sure
sign
,
in
ninety
-
nine
cases
out
of
a
hundred
,
that
she
has
something
to
conceal
.
<EOS>
I
returned
to
the
perusal
of
the
newspaper
,
strongly
suspecting
that
Miss
Halcombe
and
Miss
Fairlie
had
a
secret
between
them
which
they
were
keeping
from
Sir
Percival
,
and
keeping
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
thought
this
hard
on
both
of
us
,
especially
on
Sir
Percival
.
  
<EOS>
My
doubts
 
or
to
speak
more
correctly
,
my
convictions
 
were
confirmed
by
Miss
Halcombe
's
language
and
manner
when
I
saw
her
again
later
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
She
was
suspiciously
brief
and
reserved
in
telling
me
the
result
of
her
interview
with
her
sister
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
,
it
appeared
,
had
listened
quietly
while
the
affair
of
the
letter
was
placed
before
her
in
the
right
point
of
view
,
but
when
Miss
Halcombe
next
proceeded
to
say
that
the
object
of
Sir
Percival
's
visit
at
Limmeridge
was
to
prevail
on
her
to
let
a
day
be
fixed
for
the
marriage
she
checked
all
further
reference
to
the
subject
by
begging
for
time
.
<EOS>
If
Sir
Percival
would
consent
to
spare
her
for
the
present
,
she
would
undertake
to
give
him
his
final
answer
before
the
end
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
She
pleaded
for
this
delay
with
such
anxiety
and
agitation
,
that
Miss
Halcombe
had
promised
to
use
her
influence
,
if
necessary
,
to
obtain
it
,
and
there
,
at
Miss
Fairlie
's
earnest
entreaty
,
all
further
discussion
of
the
marriage
question
had
ended
.
  
<EOS>
The
purely
temporary
arrangement
thus
proposed
might
have
been
convenient
enough
to
the
young
lady
,
but
it
proved
somewhat
embarrassing
to
the
writer
of
these
lines
.
<EOS>
That
morning
's
post
had
brought
a
letter
from
my
partner
,
which
obliged
me
to
return
to
town
the
next
day
by
the
afternoon
train
.
<EOS>
It
was
extremely
probable
that
I
should
find
no
second
opportunity
of
presenting
myself
at
Limmeridge
House
during
the
remainder
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
,
supposing
Miss
Fairlie
ultimately
decided
on
holding
to
her
engagement
,
my
necessary
personal
communication
with
her
,
before
I
drew
her
settlement
,
would
become
something
like
a
downright
impossibility
,
and
we
should
be
obliged
to
commit
to
writing
questions
which
ought
always
to
be
discussed
on
both
sides
by
word
of
mouth
.
<EOS>
I
said
nothing
about
this
difficulty
until
Sir
Percival
had
been
consulted
on
the
subject
of
the
desired
delay
.
<EOS>
He
was
too
gallant
a
gentleman
not
to
grant
the
request
immediately
.
<EOS>
When
Miss
Halcombe
informed
me
of
this
I
told
her
that
I
must
absolutely
speak
to
her
sister
before
I
left
Limmeridge
,
and
it
was
,
therefore
,
<EOS>
arranged
that
I
should
see
Miss
Fairlie
in
her
own
sitting
-
room
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
come
down
to
dinner
,
or
join
us
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Indisposition
was
the
excuse
,
and
I
thought
Sir
Percival
looked
,
as
well
he
might
,
a
little
annoyed
when
he
heard
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
,
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
,
I
went
up
to
Miss
Fairlie
's
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
The
poor
girl
looked
so
pale
and
sad
,
and
came
forward
to
welcome
me
so
readily
and
prettily
,
that
the
resolution
to
lecture
her
on
her
caprice
and
indecision
,
which
I
had
been
forming
all
the
way
upstairs
,
failed
me
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
I
led
her
back
to
the
chair
from
which
she
had
risen
,
and
placed
myself
opposite
to
her
.
<EOS>
Her
cross
-
grained
pet
greyhound
was
in
the
room
,
and
I
fully
expected
a
barking
and
snapping
reception
.
<EOS>
Strange
to
say
,
the
whimsical
little
brute
falsified
my
expectations
by
jumping
into
my
lap
and
poking
its
sharp
muzzle
familiarly
into
my
hand
the
moment
I
sat
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
used
often
to
sit
on
my
knee
when
you
were
a
child
,
my
dear
,
"
I
said
,
"
and
now
your
little
dog
seems
determined
to
succeed
you
in
the
vacant
throne
.
<EOS>
Is
that
pretty
drawing
your
doing
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
pointed
to
a
little
album
which
lay
on
the
table
by
her
side
and
which
she
had
evidently
been
looking
over
when
I
came
in
.
<EOS>
The
page
that
lay
open
had
a
small
water
-
colour
landscape
very
neatly
mounted
on
it
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
drawing
which
had
suggested
my
question
 
<EOS>
an
idle
question
enough
 
<EOS>
but
how
could
I
begin
to
talk
of
business
to
her
the
moment
I
opened
my
lips
?
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
said
,
looking
away
from
the
drawing
rather
confusedly
,
"
it
is
not
my
doing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
fingers
had
a
restless
habit
,
which
I
remembered
in
her
as
a
child
,
of
always
playing
with
the
first
thing
that
came
to
hand
whenever
any
one
was
talking
to
her
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
they
wandered
to
the
album
,
and
toyed
absently
about
the
margin
of
the
little
water
-
colour
drawing
.
<EOS>
The
expression
of
melancholy
deepened
on
her
face
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
look
at
the
drawing
,
or
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
moved
uneasily
from
object
to
object
in
the
room
,
betraying
plainly
that
she
suspected
what
my
purpose
was
in
coming
to
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
Seeing
that
,
I
thought
it
best
to
get
to
the
purpose
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
of
the
errands
,
my
dear
,
which
brings
me
here
is
to
bid
you
good
-
bye
,
"
I
began
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
get
back
to
London
to
-
day
:
and
,
before
I
leave
,
I
want
to
have
a
word
with
you
on
the
subject
of
your
own
affairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
you
are
going
,
Mr.
Gilmore
,
"
she
said
,
looking
at
me
kindly
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
like
the
happy
old
times
to
have
you
here
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
may
be
able
to
come
back
and
recall
those
pleasant
memories
once
more
,
"
I
continued
;
"
but
as
there
is
some
uncertainty
about
the
future
,
I
must
take
my
opportunity
when
I
can
get
it
,
and
speak
to
you
now
.
<EOS>
I
am
your
old
lawyer
and
your
old
friend
,
and
I
may
remind
you
,
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
without
offence
,
of
the
possibility
of
your
marrying
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
took
her
hand
off
the
little
album
as
suddenly
as
if
it
had
turned
hot
and
burnt
her
.
<EOS>
Her
fingers
twined
together
nervously
in
her
lap
,
her
eyes
looked
down
again
at
the
floor
,
and
an
expression
of
constraint
settled
on
her
face
which
looked
almost
like
an
expression
of
pain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
absolutely
necessary
to
speak
of
my
marriage
engagement
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
in
low
tones
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
necessary
to
refer
to
it
,
"
I
answered
,
"
but
not
to
dwell
on
it
.
<EOS>
Let
us
merely
say
that
you
may
marry
,
or
that
you
may
not
marry
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
case
,
I
must
be
prepared
,
beforehand
,
to
draw
your
settlement
,
and
I
ought
not
to
do
that
without
,
as
a
matter
of
politeness
,
first
consulting
you
.
<EOS>
This
may
be
my
only
chance
of
hearing
what
your
wishes
are
.
<EOS>
Let
us
,
therefore
,
suppose
the
case
of
your
marrying
,
and
let
me
inform
you
,
in
as
few
words
as
possible
,
what
your
position
is
now
,
and
what
you
may
make
it
,
if
you
please
,
in
the
future
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
explained
to
her
the
object
of
a
marriage
-
settlement
,
and
then
told
her
exactly
what
her
prospects
were
 
in
the
first
place
,
on
her
coming
of
age
,
and
in
the
second
place
,
on
the
decease
of
her
uncle
 
marking
the
distinction
between
the
property
in
which
she
had
a
life
-
interest
only
,
and
the
property
which
was
left
at
her
own
control
.
<EOS>
She
listened
attentively
,
with
the
constrained
expression
still
on
her
face
,
and
her
hands
still
nervously
clasped
together
in
her
lap
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
I
said
in
conclusion
,
"
tell
me
if
you
can
think
of
any
condition
which
,
in
the
case
we
have
supposed
,
you
would
wish
me
to
make
for
you
 
subject
,
of
course
,
to
your
guardian
's
approval
,
as
you
are
not
yet
of
age
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
moved
uneasily
in
her
chair
,
then
looked
in
my
face
on
a
sudden
very
earnestly
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
does
happen
,
"
she
began
faintly
,
"
if
I
am
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
married
,
"
I
added
,
helping
her
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
let
him
part
me
from
Marian
,
"
she
cried
,
with
a
sudden
outbreak
of
energy
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Gilmore
,
pray
make
it
law
that
Marian
is
to
live
with
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
Under
other
circumstances
I
might
,
perhaps
,
have
been
amused
at
this
essentially
feminine
interpretation
of
my
question
,
and
of
the
long
explanation
which
had
preceded
it
.
<EOS>
But
her
looks
and
tones
,
when
she
spoke
,
were
of
a
kind
to
make
me
more
than
serious
 
<EOS>
they
distressed
me
.
<EOS>
Her
words
,
few
as
they
were
,
betrayed
a
desperate
clinging
to
the
past
which
boded
ill
for
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
having
Marian
Halcombe
to
live
with
you
can
easily
be
settled
by
private
arrangement
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
hardly
understood
my
question
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
It
referred
to
your
own
property
 
to
the
disposal
of
your
money
.
<EOS>
Supposing
you
were
to
make
a
will
when
you
come
of
age
,
who
would
you
like
the
money
to
go
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Marian
has
been
mother
and
sister
both
to
me
,
"
said
the
good
,
affectionate
girl
,
her
pretty
blue
eyes
glistening
while
she
spoke
.
<EOS>
"
May
I
leave
it
to
Marian
,
Mr.
Gilmore
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Certainly
,
my
love
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
But
remember
what
a
large
sum
it
is
.
<EOS>
Would
you
like
it
all
to
go
to
Miss
Halcombe
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
hesitated
;
her
colour
came
and
went
,
and
her
hand
stole
back
again
to
the
little
album
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
all
of
it
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
some
one
else
besides
Marian
 
<EOS>
"
  
She
stopped
;
her
colour
heightened
,
and
the
fingers
of
the
hand
that
rested
upon
the
album
beat
gently
on
the
margin
of
the
drawing
,
as
if
her
memory
had
set
them
going
mechanically
with
the
remembrance
of
a
favourite
tune
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
some
other
member
of
the
family
besides
Miss
Halcombe
?
"
I
suggested
,
seeing
her
at
a
loss
to
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
The
heightening
colour
spread
to
her
forehead
and
her
neck
,
and
the
nervous
fingers
suddenly
clasped
themselves
fast
round
the
edge
of
the
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
some
one
else
,
"
she
said
,
not
noticing
my
last
words
,
though
she
had
evidently
heard
them
;
"
there
is
some
one
else
who
might
like
a
little
keepsake
<EOS>
if
 
if
I
might
leave
it
.
<EOS>
There
would
be
no
harm
if
I
should
die
first
 
"
  
<EOS>
She
paused
again
.
<EOS>
The
colour
that
had
spread
over
her
cheeks
suddenly
,
as
suddenly
left
them
.
<EOS>
The
hand
on
the
album
resigned
its
hold
,
trembled
a
little
,
and
moved
the
book
away
from
her
.
<EOS>
She
looked
at
me
for
an
instant
 
then
turned
her
head
aside
in
the
chair
.
<EOS>
Her
handkerchief
fell
to
the
floor
as
she
changed
her
position
,
and
she
hurriedly
hid
her
face
from
me
in
her
hands
.
  
<EOS>
Sad
!
<EOS>
To
remember
her
,
as
I
did
,
the
liveliest
,
happiest
child
that
ever
laughed
the
day
through
,
and
to
see
her
now
,
in
the
flower
of
her
age
and
her
beauty
,
so
broken
and
so
brought
down
as
this
!
  
<EOS>
In
the
distress
that
she
caused
me
I
forgot
the
years
that
had
passed
,
and
the
change
they
had
made
in
our
position
towards
one
another
.
<EOS>
I
moved
my
chair
close
to
her
,
and
picked
up
her
handkerchief
from
the
carpet
,
and
drew
her
hands
from
her
face
gently
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
cry
,
my
love
,
"
I
said
,
and
dried
the
tears
that
were
gathering
in
her
eyes
with
my
own
hand
,
as
if
she
had
been
the
little
Laura
Fairlie
of
ten
long
years
ago
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
best
way
I
could
have
taken
to
compose
her
.
<EOS>
She
laid
her
head
on
my
shoulder
,
and
smiled
faintly
through
her
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
for
forgetting
myself
,
"
she
said
artlessly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
been
well
 
I
have
felt
sadly
weak
and
nervous
lately
,
and
I
often
cry
without
reason
when
I
am
alone
.
<EOS>
I
am
better
now
 
<EOS>
I
can
answer
you
as
I
ought
,
Mr.
Gilmore
,
I
can
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
my
dear
,
"
I
replied
,
"
we
will
consider
the
subject
as
done
with
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
You
have
said
enough
to
sanction
my
taking
the
best
possible
care
of
your
interests
,
and
we
can
settle
details
at
another
opportunity
.
<EOS>
Let
us
have
done
with
business
now
,
and
talk
of
something
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
led
her
at
once
into
speaking
on
other
topics
.
<EOS>
In
ten
minutes
'
time
she
was
in
better
spirits
,
and
I
rose
to
take
my
leave
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
here
again
,
"
she
said
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
to
be
worthier
of
your
kind
feeling
for
me
and
for
my
interests
if
you
will
only
come
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
Still
clinging
to
the
past
 
that
past
which
I
represented
to
her
,
in
my
way
,
as
Miss
Halcombe
did
in
hers
!
<EOS>
It
troubled
me
sorely
to
see
her
looking
back
,
at
the
beginning
of
her
career
,
just
as
I
look
back
at
the
end
of
mine
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
do
come
again
,
I
hope
I
shall
find
you
better
,
"
I
said
;
"
better
and
happier
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
my
dear
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
only
answered
by
putting
up
her
cheek
to
me
to
be
kissed
.
<EOS>
Even
lawyers
have
hearts
,
and
mine
ached
a
little
as
I
took
leave
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
whole
interview
between
us
had
hardly
lasted
more
than
half
an
hour
 
<EOS>
she
had
not
breathed
a
word
,
in
my
presence
,
to
explain
the
mystery
of
her
evident
distress
and
dismay
at
the
prospect
of
her
marriage
,
and
yet
she
had
contrived
to
win
me
over
to
her
side
of
the
question
<EOS>
,
I
neither
knew
how
nor
why
.
<EOS>
I
had
entered
the
room
,
feeling
that
Sir
Percival
Glyde
had
fair
reason
to
complain
of
the
manner
in
which
she
was
treating
him
.
<EOS>
I
left
it
,
secretly
hoping
that
matters
might
end
in
her
taking
him
at
his
word
and
claiming
her
release
.
<EOS>
A
man
of
my
age
and
experience
ought
to
have
known
better
than
to
vacillate
in
this
unreasonable
manner
.
<EOS>
I
can
make
no
excuse
for
myself
;
I
can
only
tell
the
truth
,
and
say
 
so
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
The
hour
for
my
departure
was
now
drawing
near
.
<EOS>
I
sent
to
Mr.
Fairlie
to
say
that
I
would
wait
on
him
to
take
leave
if
he
liked
,
but
that
he
must
excuse
my
being
rather
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
He
sent
a
message
back
,
written
in
pencil
on
a
slip
of
paper
:
"
Kind
love
and
best
wishes
,
dear
Gilmore
.
<EOS>
Hurry
of
any
kind
is
inexpressibly
injurious
to
me
.
<EOS>
Pray
take
care
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Just
before
I
left
I
saw
Miss
Halcombe
for
a
moment
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
said
all
you
wanted
to
Laura
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
very
weak
and
nervous
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
she
has
you
to
take
care
of
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
's
sharp
eyes
studied
my
face
attentively
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
altering
your
opinion
about
Laura
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
readier
to
make
allowances
for
her
than
you
were
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
No
sensible
man
ever
engages
,
unprepared
,
in
a
fencing
match
of
words
with
a
woman
.
<EOS>
I
only
answered
    
"
Let
me
know
what
happens
.
<EOS>
I
will
do
nothing
till
I
hear
from
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
still
looked
hard
in
my
face
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
it
was
all
over
,
and
well
over
,
<EOS>
Mr.
Gilmore
 
<EOS>
and
so
do
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
those
words
she
left
me
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
most
politely
insisted
on
seeing
me
to
the
carriage
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
ever
in
my
neighbourhood
,
"
he
said
,
"
pray
do
n't
forget
that
I
am
sincerely
anxious
to
improve
our
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
The
tried
and
trusted
old
friend
of
this
family
will
be
always
a
welcome
visitor
in
any
house
of
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
really
irresistible
man
 
courteous
,
considerate
,
delightfully
free
from
pride
 
<EOS>
a
gentleman
,
every
inch
of
him
.
<EOS>
As
I
drove
away
to
the
station
I
felt
as
if
I
could
cheerfully
do
anything
to
promote
the
interests
of
Sir
Percival
Glyde
 
anything
in
the
world
,
except
drawing
the
marriage
settlement
of
his
wife
.
    
<EOS>
A
week
passed
,
after
my
return
to
London
,
without
the
receipt
of
any
communication
from
Miss
Halcombe
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
eighth
day
a
letter
in
her
handwriting
was
placed
among
the
other
letters
on
my
table
.
  
<EOS>
It
announced
that
Sir
Percival
Glyde
had
been
definitely
accepted
,
and
that
the
marriage
was
to
take
place
,
as
he
had
originally
desired
,
before
the
end
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
In
all
probability
the
ceremony
would
be
performed
during
the
last
fortnight
in
December
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
's
twenty
-
first
birthday
was
late
in
March
.
<EOS>
She
would
,
therefore
,
by
this
arrangement
,
become
Sir
Percival
's
wife
about
three
months
before
she
was
of
age
.
  
<EOS>
I
ought
not
to
have
been
surprised
,
I
ought
not
to
have
been
sorry
,
but
I
was
surprised
and
sorry
,
nevertheless
.
<EOS>
Some
little
disappointment
,
caused
by
the
unsatisfactory
shortness
of
Miss
Halcombe
's
letter
,
mingled
itself
with
these
feelings
,
and
contributed
its
share
towards
upsetting
my
serenity
for
the
day
.
<EOS>
In
six
lines
my
correspondent
announced
the
proposed
marriage
 
in
three
more
,
she
told
me
that
Sir
Percival
had
left
Cumberland
to
return
to
his
house
in
Hampshire
,
and
in
two
concluding
sentences
she
informed
me
,
first
,
that
Laura
was
sadly
in
want
of
change
and
cheerful
society
;
secondly
,
that
she
had
resolved
to
try
the
effect
of
some
such
change
forthwith
,
by
taking
her
sister
away
with
her
on
a
visit
to
certain
old
friends
in
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
There
the
letter
ended
,
without
a
word
to
explain
what
the
circumstances
were
which
had
decided
Miss
Fairlie
to
accept
Sir
Percival
Glyde
in
one
short
week
from
the
time
when
I
had
last
seen
her
.
  
<EOS>
At
a
later
period
the
cause
of
this
sudden
determination
was
fully
explained
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
my
business
to
relate
it
imperfectly
,
on
hearsay
evidence
.
<EOS>
The
circumstances
came
within
the
personal
experience
of
Miss
Halcombe
,
and
when
her
narrative
succeeds
mine
,
she
will
describe
them
in
every
particular
exactly
as
they
happened
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
the
plain
duty
for
me
to
perform
 
before
I
,
in
my
turn
,
lay
down
my
pen
and
withdraw
from
the
story
 
is
to
relate
the
one
remaining
event
connected
with
Miss
Fairlie
's
proposed
marriage
in
which
I
was
concerned
,
namely
,
the
drawing
of
the
settlement
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
refer
intelligibly
to
this
document
without
first
entering
into
certain
particulars
in
relation
to
the
bride
's
pecuniary
affairs
.
<EOS>
I
will
try
to
make
my
explanation
briefly
and
plainly
,
and
to
keep
it
free
from
professional
obscurities
and
technicalities
.
<EOS>
The
matter
is
of
the
utmost
importance
.
<EOS>
I
warn
all
readers
of
these
lines
that
Miss
Fairlie
's
inheritance
is
a
very
serious
part
of
Miss
Fairlie
's
story
,
and
that
Mr.
Gilmore
's
experience
,
in
this
particular
,
must
be
their
experience
also
,
if
they
wish
to
understand
the
narratives
which
are
yet
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
's
expectations
,
then
,
were
of
a
twofold
kind
,
comprising
her
possible
inheritance
of
real
property
,
or
land
,
when
her
uncle
died
,
and
her
absolute
inheritance
of
personal
property
,
or
money
,
when
she
came
of
age
.
  
<EOS>
Let
us
take
the
land
first
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
time
of
Miss
Fairlie
's
paternal
grandfather
(
whom
we
will
call
Mr.
Fairlie
,
the
elder
)
the
entailed
succession
to
the
Limmeridge
estate
stood
thus
    
Mr.
Fairlie
,
the
elder
,
died
and
left
three
sons
,
Philip
,
Frederick
,
and
Arthur
.
<EOS>
As
eldest
son
,
Philip
succeeded
to
the
estate
,
If
he
died
without
leaving
a
son
,
the
property
went
to
the
second
brother
,
Frederick
;
and
if
Frederick
died
also
without
leaving
a
son
,
the
property
went
to
the
third
brother
,
Arthur
.
  
<EOS>
As
events
turned
out
,
Mr.
Philip
Fairlie
died
leaving
an
only
daughter
,
the
Laura
of
this
story
,
and
the
estate
,
in
consequence
,
went
,
in
course
of
law
,
to
the
second
brother
,
Frederick
,
a
single
man
.
<EOS>
The
third
brother
,
Arthur
,
had
died
many
years
before
the
decease
of
Philip
,
leaving
a
son
and
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
The
son
,
at
the
age
of
eighteen
,
was
drowned
at
Oxford
.
<EOS>
His
death
left
Laura
,
the
daughter
of
Mr.
Philip
Fairlie
,
presumptive
heiress
to
the
estate
,
with
every
chance
of
succeeding
to
it
,
in
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
,
on
her
uncle
Frederick
's
death
,
if
the
said
Frederick
died
without
leaving
male
issue
.
  
<EOS>
Except
in
the
event
,
then
,
of
Mr.
Frederick
Fairlie
's
marrying
and
leaving
an
heir
(
the
two
very
last
things
in
the
world
that
he
was
likely
to
do
)
,
his
niece
,
Laura
,
would
have
the
property
on
his
death
,
possessing
,
it
must
be
remembered
,
nothing
more
than
a
life
-
interest
in
it
.
<EOS>
If
she
died
single
,
or
died
childless
,
the
estate
would
revert
to
her
cousin
,
Magdalen
,
the
daughter
of
Mr.
Arthur
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
If
she
married
,
with
a
proper
settlement
 
or
,
in
other
words
,
with
the
settlement
I
meant
to
make
for
her
 
the
income
from
the
estate
(
a
good
three
thousand
a
year
)
would
,
during
her
lifetime
,
be
at
her
own
disposal
.
<EOS>
If
she
died
before
her
husband
,
he
would
naturally
expect
to
be
left
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
income
,
for
HIS
lifetime
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
a
son
,
that
son
would
be
the
heir
,
to
the
exclusion
of
her
cousin
Magdalen
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
Sir
Percival
's
prospects
in
marrying
Miss
Fairlie
(
so
far
as
his
wife
's
expectations
from
real
property
were
concerned
)
promised
him
these
two
advantages
,
on
Mr.
Frederick
Fairlie
's
death
:
<EOS>
First
,
the
use
of
three
thousand
a
year
(
by
his
wife
's
permission
,
while
she
lived
,
and
in
his
own
right
,
on
her
death
,
if
he
survived
her
)
;
and
,
secondly
,
the
inheritance
of
Limmeridge
for
his
son
,
if
he
had
one
.
  
<EOS>
So
much
for
the
landed
property
,
and
for
the
disposal
of
the
income
from
it
,
on
the
occasion
of
Miss
Fairlie
's
marriage
.
<EOS>
Thus
far
,
no
difficulty
or
difference
of
opinion
on
the
lady
's
settlement
was
at
all
likely
to
arise
between
Sir
Percival
's
lawyer
and
myself
.
  
<EOS>
The
personal
estate
,
or
,
in
other
words
,
the
money
to
which
Miss
Fairlie
would
become
entitled
on
reaching
the
age
of
twenty
-
one
years
,
is
the
next
point
to
consider
.
  
<EOS>
This
part
of
her
inheritance
was
,
in
itself
,
a
comfortable
little
fortune
.
<EOS>
It
was
derived
under
her
father
's
will
,
and
it
amounted
to
the
sum
of
twenty
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
Besides
this
,
she
had
a
life
-
interest
in
ten
thousand
pounds
more
,
which
latter
amount
was
to
go
,
on
her
decease
,
to
her
aunt
Eleanor
,
her
father
's
only
sister
.
<EOS>
It
will
greatly
assist
in
setting
the
family
affairs
before
the
reader
in
the
clearest
possible
light
,
if
I
stop
here
for
a
moment
,
to
explain
why
the
aunt
had
been
kept
waiting
for
her
legacy
until
the
death
of
the
niece
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Philip
Fairlie
had
lived
on
excellent
terms
with
his
sister
Eleanor
,
as
long
as
she
remained
a
single
woman
.
<EOS>
But
when
her
marriage
took
place
,
somewhat
late
in
life
,
and
when
that
marriage
united
her
to
an
Italian
gentleman
named
Fosco
,
or
,
rather
,
to
an
Italian
nobleman
 
seeing
that
he
rejoiced
in
the
title
of
Count
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
disapproved
of
her
conduct
so
strongly
that
he
ceased
to
hold
any
communication
with
her
,
and
even
went
the
length
of
striking
her
name
out
of
his
will
.
<EOS>
The
other
members
of
the
family
all
thought
this
serious
manifestation
of
resentment
at
his
sister
's
marriage
more
or
less
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
Count
Fosco
,
though
not
a
rich
man
,
was
not
a
penniless
adventurer
either
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
small
but
sufficient
income
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
had
lived
many
years
in
England
,
and
he
held
an
excellent
position
in
society
.
<EOS>
These
recommendations
,
however
,
availed
nothing
with
Mr.
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
In
many
of
his
opinions
he
was
an
Englishman
of
the
old
school
,
and
he
hated
a
foreigner
simply
and
solely
because
he
was
a
foreigner
.
<EOS>
The
utmost
that
he
could
be
prevailed
on
to
do
,
in
after
years
 
mainly
at
Miss
Fairlie
's
intercession
 
was
to
restore
his
sister
's
name
to
its
former
place
in
his
will
,
but
to
keep
her
waiting
for
her
legacy
by
giving
the
income
of
the
money
to
his
daughter
for
life
,
and
the
money
itself
,
if
her
aunt
died
before
her
,
to
her
cousin
Magdalen
.
<EOS>
Considering
the
relative
ages
of
the
two
ladies
,
the
aunt
's
chance
,
in
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
,
of
receiving
the
ten
thousand
pounds
,
was
thus
rendered
doubtful
in
the
extreme
;
and
Madame
Fosco
resented
her
brother
's
treatment
of
her
as
unjustly
as
usual
in
such
cases
,
by
refusing
to
see
her
niece
,
and
declining
to
believe
that
Miss
Fairlie
's
intercession
had
ever
been
exerted
to
restore
her
name
to
Mr.
Fairlie
's
will
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
the
history
of
the
ten
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
Here
again
no
difficulty
could
arise
with
Sir
Percival
's
legal
adviser
.
<EOS>
The
income
would
be
at
the
wife
's
disposal
,
and
the
principal
would
go
to
her
aunt
or
her
cousin
on
her
death
.
  
<EOS>
All
preliminary
explanations
being
now
cleared
out
of
the
way
,
I
come
at
last
to
the
real
knot
of
the
case
 
to
the
twenty
thousand
pounds
.
  
<EOS>
This
sum
was
absolutely
Miss
Fairlie
's
own
on
her
completing
her
twenty
-
first
year
,
and
the
whole
future
disposition
of
it
depended
,
in
the
first
instance
,
on
the
conditions
I
could
obtain
for
her
in
her
marriage
-
settlement
.
<EOS>
The
other
clauses
contained
in
that
document
were
of
a
formal
kind
,
and
need
not
be
recited
here
.
<EOS>
But
the
clause
relating
to
the
money
is
too
important
to
be
passed
over
.
<EOS>
A
few
lines
will
be
sufficient
to
give
the
necessary
abstract
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
My
stipulation
in
regard
to
the
twenty
thousand
pounds
was
simply
this
:
The
whole
amount
was
to
be
settled
so
as
to
give
the
income
to
the
lady
for
her
life
 
afterwards
to
Sir
Percival
for
his
life
 
and
the
principal
to
the
children
of
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
In
default
of
issue
,
the
principal
was
to
be
disposed
of
as
the
lady
might
by
her
will
direct
,
for
which
purpose
I
reserved
to
her
the
right
of
making
a
will
.
<EOS>
The
effect
of
these
conditions
may
be
thus
summed
up
.
<EOS>
If
Lady
Glyde
died
without
leaving
children
,
her
half
-
sister
Miss
Halcombe
,
and
any
other
relatives
or
friends
whom
she
might
be
anxious
to
benefit
,
would
,
on
her
husband
's
death
,
divide
among
them
such
shares
of
her
money
as
she
desired
them
to
have
.
<EOS>
If
,
on
the
other
hand
,
she
died
leaving
children
,
then
their
interest
,
naturally
and
necessarily
,
superseded
all
other
interests
whatsoever
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
clause
 
and
<EOS>
no
one
who
reads
it
can
fail
,
I
think
,
to
agree
with
me
that
it
meted
out
equal
justice
to
all
parties
.
  
<EOS>
We
shall
see
how
my
proposals
were
met
on
the
husband
's
side
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
time
when
Miss
Halcombe
's
letter
reached
me
<EOS>
I
was
even
more
busily
occupied
than
usual
.
<EOS>
But
I
contrived
to
make
leisure
for
the
settlement
.
<EOS>
I
had
drawn
it
,
and
had
sent
it
for
approval
to
Sir
Percival
's
solicitor
,
in
less
than
a
week
from
the
time
when
Miss
Halcombe
had
informed
me
of
the
proposed
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
lapse
of
two
days
the
document
was
returned
to
me
,
with
notes
and
remarks
of
the
baronet
's
lawyer
.
<EOS>
His
objections
,
in
general
,
proved
to
be
of
the
most
trifling
and
technical
kind
,
until
he
came
to
the
clause
relating
to
the
twenty
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
Against
this
there
were
double
lines
drawn
in
red
ink
,
and
the
following
note
was
appended
to
them
    
"
Not
admissible
.
<EOS>
The
PRINCIPAL
to
go
to
Sir
Percival
Glyde
,
in
the
event
of
his
surviving
Lady
Glyde
,
and
there
being
no
issue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
That
is
to
say
,
not
one
farthing
of
the
twenty
thousand
pounds
was
to
go
to
Miss
Halcombe
,
or
to
any
other
relative
or
friend
of
Lady
Glyde
's
.
<EOS>
The
whole
sum
,
if
she
left
no
children
,
was
to
slip
into
the
pockets
of
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
The
answer
I
wrote
to
this
audacious
proposal
was
as
short
and
sharp
as
I
could
make
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
sir
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
's
settlement
.
<EOS>
I
maintain
the
clause
to
which
you
object
,
exactly
as
it
stands
.
<EOS>
Yours
truly
.
<EOS>
"
The
rejoinder
came
back
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
sir
.
<EOS>
Miss
Fairlie
's
settlement
.
<EOS>
I
maintain
the
red
ink
to
which
you
object
,
exactly
as
it
stands
.
<EOS>
Yours
truly
.
<EOS>
"
In
the
detestable
slang
of
the
day
,
we
were
now
both
"
at
a
deadlock
,
"
and
nothing
was
left
for
it
but
to
refer
to
our
clients
on
either
side
.
  
<EOS>
As
matters
stood
,
my
client
 
Miss
Fairlie
not
having
yet
completed
her
twenty
-
first
year
 
Mr.
Frederick
Fairlie
,
was
her
guardian
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
by
that
day
's
post
,
and
put
the
case
before
him
exactly
as
it
stood
,
not
only
urging
every
argument
I
could
think
of
to
induce
him
to
maintain
the
clause
as
I
had
drawn
it
,
but
stating
to
him
plainly
the
mercenary
motive
which
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
opposition
to
my
settlement
of
the
twenty
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
The
knowledge
of
Sir
Percival
's
affairs
which
I
had
necessarily
gained
when
the
provisions
of
the
deed
on
HIS
side
were
submitted
in
due
course
to
my
examination
,
had
but
too
plainly
informed
me
that
the
debts
on
his
estate
were
enormous
,
and
that
his
income
,
though
nominally
a
large
one
,
was
virtually
,
for
a
man
in
his
position
,
next
to
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
want
of
ready
money
was
the
practical
necessity
of
Sir
Percival
's
existence
,
and
his
lawyer
's
note
on
the
clause
in
the
settlement
was
nothing
but
the
frankly
selfish
expression
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
's
answer
reached
me
by
return
of
post
,
and
proved
to
be
wandering
and
irrelevant
in
the
extreme
.
<EOS>
Turned
into
plain
English
,
it
practically
expressed
itself
to
this
effect
:
"
Would
dear
Gilmore
be
so
very
obliging
as
not
to
worry
his
friend
and
client
about
such
a
trifle
as
a
remote
contingency
?
<EOS>
Was
it
likely
that
a
young
woman
of
twenty
-
one
would
die
before
a
man
of
forty
five
,
and
die
without
children
?
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
in
such
a
miserable
world
as
this
,
was
it
possible
to
over
-
estimate
the
value
of
peace
and
quietness
?
<EOS>
If
those
two
heavenly
blessings
were
offered
in
exchange
for
such
an
earthly
trifle
as
a
remote
chance
of
twenty
thousand
pounds
,
was
it
not
a
fair
bargain
?
<EOS>
Surely
,
yes
.
<EOS>
Then
why
not
make
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
threw
the
letter
away
in
disgust
.
<EOS>
Just
as
it
had
fluttered
to
the
ground
,
there
was
a
knock
at
my
door
,
and
Sir
Percival
's
solicitor
,
Mr.
Merriman
,
was
shown
in
.
<EOS>
There
are
many
varieties
of
sharp
practitioners
in
this
world
,
but
I
think
the
hardest
of
all
to
deal
with
are
the
men
who
overreach
you
under
the
disguise
of
inveterate
good
-
humour
.
<EOS>
A
fat
,
well
fed
,
smiling
,
friendly
man
of
business
is
of
all
parties
to
a
bargain
the
most
hopeless
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Merriman
was
one
of
this
class
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
is
good
Mr.
Gilmore
?
<EOS>
"
he
began
,
all
in
a
glow
with
the
warmth
of
his
own
amiability
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Glad
to
see
you
,
sir
,
in
such
excellent
health
.
<EOS>
I
was
passing
your
door
,
and
I
thought
I
would
look
in
in
case
you
might
have
something
to
say
to
me
.
<EOS>
Do
 
now
pray
do
let
us
settle
this
little
difference
of
ours
by
word
of
mouth
,
if
we
can
!
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
from
your
client
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
.
Have
you
heard
from
yours
?

<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
good
sir

<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
heard
from
him
to
any
purpose
 
I
wish
,
with
all
my
heart
,
the
responsibility
was
off
my
shoulders
;
but
he
is
obstinate
 
or
let
me
rather
say
,
resolute
 
and
he
wo
n't
take
it
off
.
"
<EOS>
Merriman
,
I
leave
details
to
you
.
<EOS>
Do
what
you
think
right
for
my
interests
,
and
consider
me
as
having
personally
withdrawn
from
the
business
until
it
is
all
over
.
<EOS>
"
Those
were
Sir
Percival
's
words
a
fortnight
ago
,
and
all
I
can
get
him
to
do
now
is
to
repeat
them
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
hard
man
,
Mr.
Gilmore
,
as
you
know
.
<EOS>
Personally
and
privately
,
I
do
assure
you
,
I
should
like
to
sponge
out
that
note
of
mine
at
this
very
moment
.
<EOS>
But
if
Sir
Percival
wo
n't
go
into
the
matter
,
if
Sir
Percival
will
blindly
leave
all
his
interests
in
my
sole
care
,
what
course
can
I
possibly
take
except
the
course
of
asserting
them
?
<EOS>
My
hands
are
bound
 
<EOS>
do
n't
you
see
,
<EOS>
my
dear
sir
?
 
<EOS>
my
hands
are
bound
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
maintain
your
note
on
the
clause
,
then
,
to
the
letter
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
deuce
take
it
!
<EOS>
I
have
no
other
alternative
.
"
<EOS>
He
walked
to
the
fireplace
and
warmed
himself
,
humming
the
fag
end
of
a
tune
in
a
rich
convivial
bass
voice
.
<EOS>
"
What
does
your
side
say
?
<EOS>
"
he
went
on
;
"
now
pray
tell
me
 
what
does
your
side
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
ashamed
to
tell
him
.
<EOS>
I
attempted
to
gain
time
 
<EOS>
nay
,
I
did
worse
.
<EOS>
My
legal
instincts
got
the
better
of
me
,
and
I
even
tried
to
bargain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Twenty
thousand
pounds
is
rather
a
large
sum
to
be
given
up
by
the
lady
's
friends
at
two
days

notice
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
true

"
replied
Mr.
Merriman
,
looking
down
thoughtfully
at
his
boots
.
<EOS>
"
Properly
put
,
sir
 
most
properly
put
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
compromise
,
recognising
the
interests
of
the
lady
's
family
as
well
as
the
interests
of
the
husband
,
might
not
perhaps
have
frightened
my
client
quite
so
much
,
"
I
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
!
<EOS>
this
contingency
resolves
itself
into
a
matter
of
bargaining
after
all
.
<EOS>
What
is
the
least
you
will
take
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
least
we
will
take
,
"
said
Mr.
Merriman
,
"
is
nineteen-
thousand

nine

hundred

<EOS>
Mr.
Merriman
was
delighted
.
<EOS>
He
laughed
over
my
retort
till
the
room
rang
again
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
half
so
good
-
humoured
on
my
side

I
came
back
to
business

closed
the
interview

replied
Mr.
Merriman

<EOS>
"

He
took
up
his
hat
to
go
,
and
then
addressed
me
again
.
"
<EOS>
By
the
way

he
said
,

have
not
heard
anything
more
of
the
woman
who
wrote
the
anonymous
letter
,
have
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
more
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Have
you
found
no
trace
of
her
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
yet
,
"
said
my
legal
friend
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
do
n't
despair
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
has
his
suspicions
that
Somebody
is
keeping
her
in
hiding
,
and
we
are
having
that
Somebody
watched
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
the
old
woman
who
was
with
her
in
Cumberland
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
another
party
,
sir
,
"
answered
Mr.
Merriman
.
<EOS>
"
We
do
n't
happen
to
have
laid
hands
on
the
old
woman
yet
.
<EOS>
Our
Somebody
is
a
man
.
<EOS>
We
have
got
him
close
under
our
eye
here
in
London
,
and
we
strongly
suspect
he
had
something
to
do
with
helping
her
in
the
first
instance
to
escape
from
the
Asylum
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
wanted
to
question
him
at
once
,
but
I
said
,
"
No
.
<EOS>
Questioning
him
will
only
put
him
on
his
guard
 
<EOS>
watch
him
,
and
wait
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
what
happens
.
<EOS>
A
dangerous
woman
to
be
at
large
,
Mr.
Gilmore
<EOS>
;
nobody
knows
what
she
may
do
next
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
good
-
morning
,
sir
.
<EOS>
On
Tuesday
next
I
shall
hope
for
the
pleasure
of
hearing
from
you
.
"
<EOS>
He
smiled
amiably
and
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
My
mind
had
been
rather
absent
during
the
latter
part
of
the
conversation
with
my
legal
friend
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
anxious
about
the
matter
of
the
settlement
that
I
had
little
attention
to
give
to
any
other
subject
,
and
the
moment
I
was
left
alone
again
<EOS>
I
began
to
think
over
what
my
next
proceeding
ought
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
case
of
any
other
client
I
should
have
acted
on
my
instructions
,
however
personally
distasteful
to
me
,
and
have
given
up
the
point
about
the
twenty
thousand
pounds
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
not
act
with
this
business
-
like
indifference
towards
Miss
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
I
had
an
honest
feeling
of
affection
and
admiration
for
her
 
<EOS>
I
remembered
gratefully
that
her
father
had
been
the
kindest
patron
and
friend
to
me
that
ever
man
had
 
<EOS>
I
had
felt
towards
her
while
I
was
drawing
the
settlement
as
I
might
have
felt
,
if
I
had
not
been
an
old
bachelor
,
towards
a
daughter
of
my
own
,
and
<EOS>
I
was
determined
to
spare
no
personal
sacrifice
in
her
service
and
where
her
interests
were
concerned
.
<EOS>
Writing
a
second
time
to
Mr.
Fairlie
was
not
to
be
thought
of
 
it
would
only
be
giving
him
a
second
opportunity
of
slipping
through
my
fingers
.
<EOS>
Seeing
him
and
personally
remonstrating
with
him
might
possibly
be
of
more
use
.
<EOS>
The
next
day
was
Saturday
.
<EOS>
I
determined
to
take
a
return
ticket
and
jolt
my
old
bones
down
to
Cumberland
,
on
the
chance
of
persuading
him
to
adopt
the
just
,
the
independent
,
and
the
honourable
course
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
poor
chance
enough
,
no
doubt
,
but
when
I
had
tried
it
my
conscience
would
be
at
ease
.
<EOS>
I
should
then
have
done
all
that
a
man
in
my
position
could
do
to
serve
the
interests
of
my
old
friend
's
only
child
.
  
<EOS>
The
weather
on
Saturday
was
beautiful
,
a
west
wind
and
a
bright
sun
.
<EOS>
Having
felt
latterly
a
return
of
that
fulness
and
oppression
of
the
head
,
against
which
my
doctor
warned
me
so
seriously
more
than
two
years
since
,
I
resolved
to
take
the
opportunity
of
getting
a
little
extra
exercise
by
sending
my
bag
on
before
me
and
walking
to
the
terminus
in
Euston
Square
.
<EOS>
As
I
came
out
into
Holborn
a
gentleman
walking
by
rapidly
stopped
and
spoke
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
Mr.
Walter
Hartright
.
  
<EOS>
If
he
had
not
been
the
first
to
greet
me
<EOS>
I
should
certainly
have
passed
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
changed
that
I
hardly
knew
him
again
.
<EOS>
His
face
looked
pale
and
haggard
 
<EOS>
his
manner
was
hurried
and
uncertain
 
and
<EOS>
his
dress
,
which
I
remembered
as
neat
and
gentlemanlike
when
I
saw
him
at
Limmeridge
,
was
so
slovenly
now
that
I
should
really
have
been
ashamed
of
the
appearance
of
it
on
one
of
my
own
clerks
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
been
long
back
from
Cumberland
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
from
Miss
Halcombe
lately
.
<EOS>
I
am
aware
that
Sir
Percival
Glyde
's
explanation
has
been
considered
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
Will
the
marriage
take
place
soon
?
<EOS>
Do
you
happen
to
know
Mr.
Gilmore
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
spoke
so
fast
,
and
crowded
his
questions
together
so
strangely
and
confusedly
,
that
I
could
hardly
follow
him
.
<EOS>
However
accidentally
intimate
he
might
have
been
with
the
family
at
Limmeridge
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
see
that
he
had
any
right
to
expect
information
on
their
private
affairs
,
and
I
determined
to
drop
him
,
as
easily
as
might
be
,
on
the
subject
of
Miss
Fairlie
's
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Time
will
show
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
"
I
said
 
"
time
will
show
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
if
we
look
out
for
the
marriage
in
the
papers
we
shall
not
be
far
wrong
.
<EOS>
Excuse
my
noticing
it
,
but
I
am
sorry
to
see
you
not
looking
so
well
as
you
were
when
we
last
met
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
momentary
nervous
contraction
quivered
about
his
lips
and
eyes
,
and
made
me
half
reproach
myself
for
having
answered
him
in
such
a
significantly
guarded
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
no
right
to
ask
about
her
marriage
,
"
he
said
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
wait
to
see
it
in
the
newspapers
like
other
people
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
 
he
went
on
before
I
could
make
any
apologies
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
been
well
lately
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
another
country
to
try
a
change
of
scene
and
occupation
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
has
kindly
assisted
me
with
her
influence
,
and
my
testimonials
have
been
found
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
long
distance
off
,
but
I
do
n't
care
where
I
go
,
what
the
climate
is
,
or
how
long
I
am
away
.
"
<EOS>
He
looked
about
him
while
he
said
this
at
the
throng
of
strangers
passing
us
by
on
either
side
,
in
a
strange
,
suspicious
manner
,
as
if
he
thought
that
some
of
them
might
be
watching
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
well
through
it
,
and
safe
back
again
,
"
I
said
,
and
then
added
,
<EOS>
so
as
not
to
keep
him
altogether
at
arm
's
length
on
the
subject
of
the
Fairlies
,
"
I
am
going
down
to
Limmeridge
to
-
day
on
business
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
and
Miss
Fairlie
are
away
just
now
on
a
visit
to
some
friends
in
Yorkshire
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
eyes
brightened
,
and
he
seemed
about
to
say
something
in
answer
,
but
the
same
momentary
nervous
spasm
crossed
his
face
again
.
<EOS>
He
took
my
hand
,
pressed
it
hard
,
and
disappeared
among
the
crowd
without
saying
another
word
.
<EOS>
Though
he
was
little
more
than
a
stranger
to
me
,
I
waited
for
a
moment
,
looking
after
him
almost
with
a
feeling
of
regret
.
<EOS>
I
had
gained
in
my
profession
sufficient
experience
of
young
men
to
know
what
the
outward
signs
and
tokens
were
of
their
beginning
to
go
wrong
,
and
when
I
resumed
my
walk
to
the
railway
I
am
sorry
to
say
I
felt
more
than
doubtful
about
Mr.
Hartright
's
future
.
    
<EOS>
Leaving
by
an
early
train
,
I
got
to
Limmeridge
in
time
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
The
house
was
oppressively
empty
and
dull
.
<EOS>
I
had
expected
that
good
Mrs.
Vesey
would
have
been
company
for
me
in
the
absence
of
the
young
ladies
,
but
she
was
confined
to
her
room
by
a
cold
.
<EOS>
The
servants
were
so
surprised
at
seeing
me
that
they
hurried
and
bustled
absurdly
,
and
made
all
sorts
of
annoying
mistakes
.
<EOS>
Even
the
butler
,
who
was
old
enough
to
have
known
better
,
brought
me
a
bottle
of
port
that
was
chilled
.
<EOS>
The
reports
of
Mr.
Fairlie
's
health
were
just
as
usual
,
and
when
I
sent
up
a
message
to
announce
my
arrival
,
I
was
told
that
he
would
be
delighted
to
see
me
the
next
morning
but
that
the
sudden
news
of
my
appearance
had
prostrated
him
with
palpitations
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
The
wind
howled
dismally
all
night
,
and
strange
cracking
and
groaning
noises
sounded
here
,
there
,
and
everywhere
in
the
empty
house
.
<EOS>
I
slept
as
wretchedly
as
possible
,
and
got
up
in
a
mighty
bad
humour
to
breakfast
by
myself
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
At
ten
o'clock
I
was
conducted
to
Mr.
Fairlie
's
apartments
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
his
usual
room
,
his
usual
chair
,
and
his
usual
aggravating
state
of
mind
and
body
.
<EOS>
When
I
went
in
,
his
valet
was
standing
before
him
,
holding
up
for
inspection
a
heavy
volume
of
etchings
,
as
long
and
as
broad
as
my
office
writing
-
desk
.
<EOS>
The
miserable
foreigner
grinned
in
the
most
abject
manner
,
and
looked
ready
to
drop
with
fatigue
,
while
his
master
composedly
turned
over
the
etchings
,
and
brought
their
hidden
beauties
to
light
with
the
help
of
a
magnifying
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
very
best
of
good
old
friends
,
"
said
Mr.
Fairlie
,
leaning
back
lazily
before
he
could
look
at
me
,
"
are
you
QUITE
<EOS>
well
?
<EOS>
How
nice
of
you
to
come
here
and
see
me
in
my
solitude
.
<EOS>
Dear
Gilmore
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
expected
that
the
valet
would
be
dismissed
when
I
appeared
,
but
nothing
of
the
sort
happened
.
<EOS>
There
he
stood
,
in
front
of
his
master
's
chair
,
trembling
under
the
weight
of
the
etchings
,
and
there
Mr.
Fairlie
sat
,
serenely
twirling
the
magnifying
glass
between
his
white
fingers
and
thumbs
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
to
speak
to
you
on
a
very
important
matter
,
"
I
said
,
"
and
you
will
therefore
excuse
me
,
if
I
suggest
that
we
had
better
be
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
valet
looked
at
me
gratefully
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
faintly
repeated
my
last
three
words
,
"
better
be
alone
,
"
with
every
appearance
of
the
utmost
possible
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
in
no
humour
for
trifling
,
and
I
resolved
to
make
him
understand
what
I
meant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oblige
me
by
giving
that
man
permission
to
withdraw
,
"
I
said
,
pointing
to
the
valet
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
arched
his
eyebrows
and
pursed
up
his
lips
in
sarcastic
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Man
?
"
he
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
You
provoking
old
Gilmore
,
what
can
you
possibly
mean
by
calling
him
a
man
?
<EOS>
He
's
nothing
of
the
sort
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
been
a
man
half
an
hour
ago
,
before
I
wanted
my
etchings
,
and
he
may
be
a
man
half
an
hour
hence
,
when
I
do
n't
want
them
any
longer
.
<EOS>
At
present
he
is
simply
a
portfolio
stand
.
<EOS>
Why
object
,
Gilmore
,
to
a
portfolio
stand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
DO
object
.
<EOS>
For
the
third
time
,
Mr.
Fairlie
,
I
beg
that
we
may
be
alone
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
tone
and
manner
left
him
no
alternative
but
to
comply
with
my
request
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
the
servant
,
and
pointed
peevishly
to
a
chair
at
his
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
Put
down
the
etchings
and
go
away
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
upset
me
by
losing
my
place
.
<EOS>
Have
you
,
or
have
you
not
,
lost
my
place
?
<EOS>
Are
you
sure
you
have
not
?
<EOS>
And
have
you
put
my
hand
-
bell
quite
within
my
reach
?
<EOS>
Yes
?
<EOS>
Then
why
the
devil
do
n't
you
go
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
valet
went
out
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
twisted
himself
round
in
his
chair
,
polished
the
magnifying
glass
with
his
delicate
cambric
handkerchief
,
and
indulged
himself
with
a
sidelong
inspection
of
the
open
volume
of
etchings
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
easy
to
keep
my
temper
under
these
circumstances
,
but
I
did
keep
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
here
at
great
personal
inconvenience
,
"
I
said
,
"
to
serve
the
interests
of
your
niece
and
your
family
,
and
I
think
I
have
established
some
slight
claim
to
be
favoured
with
your
attention
in
return
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
bully
me
!
"
exclaimed
Mr.
Fairlie
,
falling
back
helplessly
in
the
chair
,
and
closing
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
Please
do
n't
bully
me
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
strong
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
determined
not
to
let
him
provoke
me
,
for
Laura
Fairlie
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
object
,
"
<EOS>
I
went
on
,
"
is
to
entreat
you
to
reconsider
your
letter
,
and
not
to
force
me
to
abandon
the
just
rights
of
your
niece
,
and
of
all
who
belong
to
her
.
<EOS>
Let
me
state
the
case
to
you
once
more
,
and
for
the
last
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
shook
his
head
and
sighed
piteously
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
heartless
of
you
,
Gilmore
 
very
heartless
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
put
all
the
points
to
him
carefully
 
<EOS>
I
set
the
matter
before
him
in
every
conceivable
light
.
<EOS>
He
lay
back
in
the
chair
the
whole
time
I
was
speaking
with
his
eyes
closed
.
<EOS>
When
I
had
done
he
opened
them
indolently
,
took
his
silver
smelling
-
bottle
from
the
table
,
and
sniffed
at
it
with
an
air
of
gentle
relish
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
Gilmore
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
between
the
sniffs
,
"
how
very
nice
this
is
of
you
!
<EOS>
How
you
reconcile
one
to
human
nature
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Give
me
a
plain
answer
to
a
plain
question
,
Mr.
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
again
,
Sir
Percival
Glyde
has
no
shadow
of
a
claim
to
expect
more
than
the
income
of
the
money
.
<EOS>
The
money
itself
if
your
niece
has
no
children
,
ought
to
be
under
her
control
,
and
to
return
to
her
family
.
<EOS>
If
you
stand
firm
,
Sir
Percival
must
give
way
 
<EOS>
he
must
give
way
<EOS>
,
I
tell
you
,
or
he
exposes
himself
to
the
base
imputation
of
marrying
Miss
Fairlie
entirely
from
mercenary
motives
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
shook
the
silver
smelling
-
bottle
at
me
playfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
dear
old
Gilmore
,
how
you
do
hate
rank
and
family
,
do
n't
you
?
<EOS>
How
you
detest
Glyde
because
he
happens
to
be
a
baronet
.
<EOS>
What
a
Radical
<EOS>
you
are
 
<EOS>
oh
,
dear
me
,
what
a
Radical
you
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
Radical
!
!
<EOS>
!
<EOS>
I
could
put
up
with
a
good
deal
of
provocation
,
but
,
after
holding
the
soundest
Conservative
principles
all
my
life
,
I
could
NOT
put
up
with
being
called
a
Radical
.
<EOS>
My
blood
boiled
at
it
 
<EOS>
I
started
out
of
my
chair
 
<EOS>
I
was
speechless
with
Indignation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
shake
the
room
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr.
Fairlie
 
"
for
Heaven
's
sake
<EOS>
do
n't
shake
the
room
!
<EOS>
Worthiest
of
all
possible
Gilmores
,
I
meant
no
offence
.
<EOS>
My
own
views
are
so
extremely
liberal
that
I
think
I
am
a
Radical
myself
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
We
are
a
pair
of
Radicals
.
<EOS>
Please
do
n't
be
angry
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
quarrel
 
<EOS>
I
have
n't
stamina
enough
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
drop
the
subject
?
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Come
and
look
at
these
sweet
etchings
.
<EOS>
Do
let
me
teach
you
to
understand
the
heavenly
pearliness
of
these
lines
.
<EOS>
Do
now
,
there
's
a
good
Gilmore
!
"
  
<EOS>
While
he
was
maundering
on
in
this
way
I
was
,
fortunately
for
my
own
self
-
respect
,
returning
to
my
senses
.
<EOS>
When
I
spoke
again
I
was
composed
enough
to
treat
his
impertinence
with
the
silent
contempt
that
it
deserved
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
entirely
wrong
,
sir
,
"
I
said
,
"
in
supposing
that
I
speak
from
any
prejudice
against
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
I
may
regret
that
he
has
so
unreservedly
resigned
himself
in
this
matter
to
his
lawyer
's
direction
as
to
make
any
appeal
to
himself
impossible
,
but
I
am
not
prejudiced
against
him
.
<EOS>
What
I
have
said
would
equally
apply
to
any
other
man
in
his
situation
,
high
or
low
.
<EOS>
The
principle
I
maintain
is
a
recognised
principle
.
<EOS>
If
you
were
to
apply
at
the
nearest
town
here
,
to
the
first
respectable
solicitor
you
could
find
,
he
would
tell
you
as
a
stranger
what
I
tell
you
as
a
friend
.
<EOS>
He
would
inform
you
that
it
is
against
all
rule
to
abandon
the
lady
's
money
entirely
to
the
man
she
marries
.
<EOS>
He
would
decline
,
on
grounds
of
common
legal
caution
,
to
give
the
husband
,
under
any
circumstances
whatever
,
an
interest
of
twenty
thousand
pounds
in
his
wife
's
death
.
"
  
"
Would
he
really
,
Gilmore
?
"
said
Mr.
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
said
anything
half
so
horrid
,
I
do
assure
you
I
should
tinkle
my
bell
for
Louis
,
and
have
him
sent
out
of
the
house
immediately
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
irritate
me
,
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
 
for
your
niece
's
sake
and
for
her
father
's
sake
,
you
shall
not
irritate
me
.
<EOS>
You
shall
take
the
whole
responsibility
of
this
discreditable
settlement
on
your
own
shoulders
before
I
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
!
 
<EOS>
now
please
do
n't
!
"
said
Mr.
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
"
Think
how
precious
your
time
is
,
Gilmore
,
and
do
n't
throw
it
away
.
<EOS>
I
would
dispute
with
you
if
I
could
,
but
I
ca
n't
 
I
have
n't
stamina
enough
.
<EOS>
You
want
to
upset
me
,
to
upset
yourself
,
to
upset
Glyde
,
and
to
upset
Laura
;
and
 
oh
,
dear
me
!
 
<EOS>
all
for
the
sake
of
the
very
last
thing
in
the
world
that
is
likely
to
happen
.
<EOS>
No
,
dear
friend
,
in
the
interests
of
peace
and
quietness
,
positively
No
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
to
understand
,
then
,
that
you
hold
by
the
determination
expressed
in
your
letter
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
please
.
<EOS>
So
glad
we
understand
each
other
at
last
.
<EOS>
Sit
down
again
 
do
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
walked
at
once
to
the
door
,
and
Mr.
Fairlie
resignedly
"
tinkled
"
his
hand
-
bell
.
<EOS>
Before
I
left
the
room
I
turned
round
and
addressed
him
for
the
last
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whatever
happens
in
the
future
,
sir
,
"
I
said
,
"
remember
that
my
plain
duty
of
warning
you
has
been
performed
.
<EOS>
As
the
faithful
friend
and
servant
of
your
family
,
I
tell
you
,
at
parting
,
that
no
daughter
of
mine
should
be
married
to
any
man
alive
under
such
a
settlement
as
you
are
forcing
me
to
make
for
Miss
Fairlie
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
door
opened
behind
me
,
and
the
valet
stood
waiting
on
the
threshold
.
  
<EOS>
"
Louis
,
"
said
Mr.
Fairlie
,
"
show
Mr.
Gilmore
out
,
and
then
come
back
and
hold
up
my
etchings
for
me
again
.
<EOS>
Make
them
give
you
a
good
lunch
downstairs
.
<EOS>
Do
,
Gilmore
,
make
my
idle
beasts
of
servants
give
you
a
good
lunch
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
too
much
disgusted
to
reply
 
<EOS>
I
turned
on
my
heel
,
and
left
him
in
silence
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
up
train
at
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
and
by
that
train
I
returned
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
Tuesday
I
sent
in
the
altered
settlement
,
which
practically
disinherited
the
very
persons
whom
Miss
Fairlie
's
own
lips
had
informed
me
<EOS>
she
was
most
anxious
to
benefit
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
choice
.
<EOS>
Another
lawyer
would
have
drawn
up
the
deed
if
I
had
refused
to
undertake
it
.
  
<EOS>
My
task
is
done
.
<EOS>
My
personal
share
in
the
events
of
the
family
story
extends
no
farther
than
the
point
which
I
have
just
reached
.
<EOS>
Other
pens
than
mine
will
describe
the
strange
circumstances
which
are
now
shortly
to
follow
.
<EOS>
Seriously
and
sorrowfully
I
close
this
brief
record
.
<EOS>
Seriously
and
sorrowfully
I
repeat
here
the
parting
words
that
I
spoke
at
Limmeridge
House
:
 
<EOS>
No
daughter
of
mine
should
have
been
married
to
any
man
alive
under
such
a
settlement
as
I
was
compelled
to
make
for
Laura
Fairlie
.

THE
STORY
CONTINUED
<EOS>
BY
MARIAN
HALCOMBE
  
(
in
Extracts
from
her
Diary
)
  
<EOS>
LIMMERIDGE
HOUSE
,
Nov.
8.[1
]
  
<EOS>
[

]
The
passages
omitted
,
here
and
elsewhere
,
in
Miss
Halcombe
's
Diary
are
only
those
which
bear
no
reference
to
Miss
Fairlie
or
to
any
of
the
persons
with
whom
she
is
associated
in
these
pages
.
  
<EOS>
This
morning
Mr.
Gilmore
left
us
.
  
<EOS>
His
interview
with
Laura
had
evidently
grieved
and
surprised
him
more
than
he
liked
to
confess
.
<EOS>
I
felt
afraid
,
from
his
look
and
manner
when
we
parted
,
that
she
might
have
inadvertently
betrayed
to
him
the
real
secret
of
her
depression
and
my
anxiety
.
<EOS>
This
doubt
grew
on
me
so
,
after
he
had
gone
,
that
I
declined
riding
out
with
Sir
Percival
,
and
went
up
to
Laura
's
room
instead
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
been
sadly
distrustful
of
myself
,
in
this
difficult
and
lamentable
matter
,
ever
since
I
found
out
my
own
ignorance
of
the
strength
of
Laura
's
unhappy
attachment
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
known
that
the
delicacy
and
forbearance
and
sense
of
honour
which
drew
me
to
poor
Hartright
,
and
made
me
so
sincerely
admire
and
respect
him
,
were
just
the
qualities
to
appeal
most
irresistibly
to
Laura
's
natural
sensitiveness
and
natural
generosity
of
nature
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
until
she
opened
her
heart
to
me
of
her
own
accord
,
I
had
no
suspicion
that
this
new
feeling
had
taken
root
so
deeply
.
<EOS>
I
once
thought
time
and
care
might
remove
it
.
<EOS>
I
now
fear
that
it
will
remain
with
her
and
alter
her
for
life
.
<EOS>
The
discovery
that
I
have
committed
such
an
error
in
judgment
as
this
makes
me
hesitate
about
everything
else
.
<EOS>
I
hesitate
about
Sir
Percival
,
in
the
face
of
the
plainest
proofs
.
<EOS>
I
hesitate
even
in
speaking
to
Laura
.
<EOS>
On
this
very
morning
I
doubted
,
with
my
hand
on
the
door
,
whether
I
should
ask
her
the
questions
I
had
come
to
put
,
or
not
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
went
into
her
room
I
found
her
walking
up
and
down
in
great
impatience
.
<EOS>
She
looked
flushed
and
excited
,
and
she
came
forward
at
once
,
and
spoke
to
me
before
I
could
open
my
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wanted
you
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Come
and
sit
down
on
the
sofa
with
me
.
<EOS>
Marian
!
<EOS>
I
can
bear
this
no
longer
 
<EOS>
I
must
and
will
end
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
too
much
colour
in
her
cheeks
,
too
much
energy
in
her
manner
,
too
much
firmness
in
her
voice
.
<EOS>
The
little
book
of
Hartright
's
drawings
 
the
fatal
book
that
she
will
dream
over
whenever
she
is
alone
 
was
in
one
of
her
hands
.
<EOS>
I
began
by
gently
and
firmly
taking
it
from
her
,
and
putting
it
out
of
sight
on
a
side
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
quietly
,
my
darling
,
what
you
wish
to
do
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Has
Mr.
Gilmore
been
advising
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
not
in
what
I
am
thinking
of
now
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
kind
and
good
to
me
,
Marian
,
and
I
am
ashamed
to
say
I
distressed
him
by
crying
.
<EOS>
I
am
miserably
helpless
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
control
myself
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
sake
,
and
for
all
our
sakes
,
I
must
have
courage
enough
to
end
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
courage
enough
to
claim
your
release
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
said
simply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Courage
,
dear
,
to
tell
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
put
her
arms
round
my
neck
,
and
rested
her
head
quietly
on
my
bosom
.
<EOS>
On
the
opposite
wall
hung
the
miniature
portrait
of
her
father
.
<EOS>
I
bent
over
her
,
and
saw
that
she
was
looking
at
it
while
her
head
lay
on
my
breast
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
never
claim
my
release
from
my
engagement
,
"
she
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
Whatever
way
it
ends
it
must
end
wretchedly
for
me
.
<EOS>
All
I
can
do
,
Marian
,
is
not
to
add
the
remembrance
that
I
have
broken
my
promise
and
forgotten
my
father
's
dying
words
,
to
make
that
wretchedness
worse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
you
propose
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
tell
Sir
Percival
Glyde
the
truth
with
my
own
lips
,
"
she
answered
,
"
and
to
let
him
release
me
,
if
he
will
,
not
because
I
ask
him
,
but
because
he
knows
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
Laura
,
by
"
all
"
?
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
will
know
enough
(
he
has
told
me
so
himself
)
if
he
knows
that
the
engagement
is
opposed
to
your
own
wishes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
I
tell
him
that
,
when
the
engagement
was
made
for
me
by
my
father
,
with
my
own
consent
?
<EOS>
I
should
have
kept
my
promise
,
not
happily
,
I
am
afraid
,
but
still
contentedly
 
"
she
stopped
,
turned
her
face
to
me
,
and
laid
her
cheek
close
against
mine
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
kept
my
engagement
,
Marian
,
if
another
love
had
not
grown
up
in
my
heart
,
which
was
not
there
when
I
first
promised
to
be
Sir
Percival
's
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Laura
!
<EOS>
you
will
never
lower
yourself
by
making
a
confession
to
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
lower
myself
,
indeed
,
if
I
gain
my
release
by
hiding
from
him
what
he
has
a
right
to
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
not
the
shadow
of
a
right
to
know
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wrong
,
Marian
,
wrong
!
<EOS>
I
ought
to
deceive
no
one
 
least
of
all
the
man
to
whom
my
father
gave
me
,
and
to
whom
I
gave
myself
.
"
<EOS>
She
put
her
lips
to
mine
,
and
kissed
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
own
love
,
"
she
said
softly
,
"
you
are
so
much
too
fond
of
me
,
and
so
much
too
proud
of
me
,
that
you
forget
,
in
my
case
,
what
you
would
remember
in
your
own
.
<EOS>
Better
that
Sir
Percival
should
doubt
my
motives
,
and
misjudge
my
conduct
if
he
will
,
than
that
I
should
be
first
false
to
him
in
thought
,
and
then
mean
enough
to
serve
my
own
interests
by
hiding
the
falsehood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
held
her
away
from
me
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
in
our
lives
we
had
changed
places
 
<EOS>
the
resolution
was
all
on
her
side
,
the
hesitation
all
on
mine
.
<EOS>
I
looked
into
the
pale
,
quiet
,
resigned
young
face
 
<EOS>
I
saw
the
pure
,
innocent
heart
,
in
the
loving
eyes
that
looked
back
at
me
 
and
the
poor
worldly
cautions
and
objections
that
rose
to
my
lips
dwindled
and
died
away
in
their
own
emptiness
.
<EOS>
I
hung
my
head
in
silence
.
<EOS>
In
her
place
the
despicably
small
pride
which
makes
so
many
women
deceitful
would
have
been
my
pride
,
and
would
have
made
me
deceitful
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
angry
with
me
,
Marian
,
"
she
said
,
mistaking
my
silence
.
  
<EOS>
I
only
answered
by
drawing
her
close
to
me
again
.
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
of
crying
if
I
spoke
.
<EOS>
My
tears
do
not
flow
so
easily
as
they
ought
 
<EOS>
they
come
almost
like
men
's
tears
,
with
sobs
that
seem
to
tear
me
in
pieces
,
and
that
frighten
every
one
about
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
thought
of
this
,
love
,
for
many
days
,
"
she
went
on
,
twining
and
twisting
my
hair
with
that
childish
restlessness
in
her
fingers
,
which
poor
Mrs.
Vesey
still
tries
so
patiently
and
so
vainly
to
cure
her
of
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
thought
of
it
very
seriously
,
and
I
can
be
sure
of
my
courage
when
my
own
conscience
tells
me
I
am
right
.
<EOS>
Let
me
speak
to
him
to
-
morrow
 
in
your
presence
,
Marian
.
<EOS>
I
will
say
nothing
that
is
wrong
,
nothing
that
you
or
I
need
be
ashamed
of
 
<EOS>
but
,
oh
,
it
will
ease
my
heart
so
to
end
this
miserable
concealment
!
<EOS>
Only
let
me
know
and
feel
that
I
have
no
deception
to
answer
for
on
my
side
,
and
then
,
when
he
has
heard
what
I
have
to
say
,
let
him
act
towards
me
as
he
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
sighed
,
and
put
her
head
back
in
its
old
position
on
my
bosom
.
<EOS>
Sad
misgivings
about
what
the
end
would
be
weighed
upon
my
mind
,
but
still
distrusting
myself
,
I
told
her
that
I
would
do
as
she
wished
.
<EOS>
She
thanked
me
,
and
we
passed
gradually
into
talking
of
other
things
.
  
<EOS>
At
dinner
she
joined
us
again
,
and
was
more
easy
and
more
herself
with
Sir
Percival
than
I
have
seen
her
yet
.
<EOS>
In
the
evening
she
went
to
the
piano
,
choosing
new
music
of
the
dexterous
,
tuneless
,
florid
kind
.
<EOS>
The
lovely
old
melodies
of
Mozart
,
which
poor
Hartright
was
so
fond
of
,
she
has
never
played
since
he
left
.
<EOS>
The
book
is
no
longer
in
the
music
-
stand
.
<EOS>
She
took
the
volume
away
herself
,
so
that
nobody
might
find
it
out
and
ask
her
to
play
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
no
opportunity
of
discovering
whether
her
purpose
of
the
morning
had
changed
or
not
,
until
she
wished
Sir
Percival
good
-
night
 
<EOS>
and
then
her
own
words
informed
me
that
it
was
unaltered
.
<EOS>
She
said
,
very
quietly
,
that
she
wished
to
speak
to
him
after
breakfast
,
and
that
he
would
find
her
in
her
sitting
-
room
with
me
.
<EOS>
He
changed
colour
at
those
words
,
and
I
felt
his
hand
trembling
a
little
when
it
came
to
my
turn
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
The
event
of
the
next
morning
would
decide
his
future
life
,
and
he
evidently
knew
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
in
,
as
usual
,
through
the
door
between
our
two
bedrooms
,
to
bid
Laura
good
-
night
before
she
went
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
In
stooping
over
her
to
kiss
her
<EOS>
I
saw
the
little
book
of
Hartright
's
drawings
half
hidden
under
her
pillow
,
just
in
the
place
where
she
used
to
hide
her
favourite
toys
when
she
was
a
child
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
say
anything
,
but
I
pointed
to
the
book
and
shook
my
head
.
<EOS>
She
reached
both
hands
up
to
my
cheeks
,
and
drew
my
face
down
to
hers
till
our
lips
met
.
  
<EOS>
"
Leave
it
there
to
-
night
,
"
she
whispered
;
"
to
-
morrow
may
be
cruel
,
and
may
make
me
say
good
-
bye
to
it
for
ever
.
"
  
<EOS>
9th
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
event
of
the
morning
was
not
of
a
kind
to
raise
my
spirits
 
a
letter
arrived
for
me
from
poor
Walter
Hartright
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
answer
to
mine
describing
the
manner
in
which
Sir
Percival
cleared
himself
of
the
suspicions
raised
by
Anne
Catherick
's
letter
.
<EOS>
He
writes
shortly
and
bitterly
about
Sir
Percival
's
explanations
,
only
saying
that
he
has
no
right
to
offer
an
opinion
on
the
conduct
of
those
who
are
above
him
.
<EOS>
This
is
sad
,
but
his
occasional
references
to
himself
grieve
me
still
more
.
<EOS>
He
says
that
the
effort
to
return
to
his
old
habits
and
pursuits
grows
harder
instead
of
easier
to
him
every
day
and
he
implores
me
,
if
I
have
any
interest
,
to
exert
it
to
get
him
employment
that
will
necessitate
his
absence
from
England
,
and
take
him
among
new
scenes
and
new
people
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
made
all
the
readier
to
comply
with
this
request
by
a
passage
at
the
end
of
his
letter
,
which
has
almost
alarmed
me
.
  
<EOS>
After
mentioning
that
he
has
neither
seen
nor
heard
anything
of
Anne
Catherick
,
he
suddenly
breaks
off
,
and
hints
in
the
most
abrupt
,
mysterious
manner
,
that
he
has
been
perpetually
watched
and
followed
by
strange
men
ever
since
he
returned
to
London
.
<EOS>
He
acknowledges
that
he
can
not
prove
this
extraordinary
suspicion
by
fixing
on
any
particular
persons
,
but
he
declares
that
the
suspicion
itself
is
present
to
him
night
and
day
.
<EOS>
This
has
frightened
me
,
because
it
looks
as
if
his
one
fixed
idea
about
Laura
was
becoming
too
much
for
his
mind
.
<EOS>
I
will
write
immediately
to
some
of
my
mother
's
influential
old
friends
in
London
,
and
press
his
claims
on
their
notice
.
<EOS>
Change
of
scene
and
change
of
occupation
may
really
be
the
salvation
of
him
at
this
crisis
in
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
Greatly
to
my
relief
,
Sir
Percival
sent
an
apology
for
not
joining
us
at
breakfast
.
<EOS>
He
had
taken
an
early
cup
of
coffee
in
his
own
room
,
and
he
was
still
engaged
there
in
writing
letters
.
<EOS>
At
eleven
o'clock
,
if
that
hour
was
convenient
,
he
would
do
himself
the
honour
of
waiting
on
Miss
Fairlie
and
Miss
Halcombe
.
  
<EOS>
My
eyes
were
on
Laura
's
face
while
the
message
was
being
delivered
.
<EOS>
I
had
found
her
unaccountably
quiet
and
composed
on
going
into
her
room
in
the
morning
,
and
so
she
remained
all
through
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Even
when
we
were
sitting
together
on
the
sofa
in
her
room
,
waiting
for
Sir
Percival
,
she
still
preserved
her
self
-
control
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
afraid
of
me
,
Marian
,
"
was
all
she
said
;
"
I
may
forget
myself
with
an
old
friend
like
Mr.
Gilmore
,
or
with
a
dear
sister
like
you
,
but
I
will
not
forget
myself
with
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
looked
at
her
,
and
listened
to
her
in
silent
surprise
.
<EOS>
Through
all
the
years
of
our
close
intimacy
this
passive
force
in
her
character
had
been
hidden
from
me
 
hidden
even
from
herself
,
till
love
found
it
,
and
suffering
called
it
forth
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
struck
eleven
Sir
Percival
knocked
at
the
door
and
came
in
.
<EOS>
There
was
suppressed
anxiety
and
agitation
in
every
line
of
his
face
.
<EOS>
The
dry
,
sharp
cough
,
which
teases
him
at
most
times
,
seemed
to
be
troubling
him
more
incessantly
than
ever
.
<EOS>
He
sat
down
opposite
to
us
at
the
table
,
and
Laura
remained
by
me
.
<EOS>
I
looked
attentively
at
them
both
,
and
he
was
the
palest
of
the
two
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
a
few
unimportant
words
,
with
a
visible
effort
to
preserve
his
customary
ease
of
manner
.
<EOS>
But
his
voice
was
not
to
be
steadied
,
and
the
restless
uneasiness
in
his
eyes
was
not
to
be
concealed
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
felt
this
himself
,
for
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
,
and
gave
up
even
the
attempt
to
hide
his
embarrassment
any
longer
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
just
one
moment
of
dead
silence
before
Laura
addressed
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
speak
to
you
,
Sir
Percival
,
"
she
said
,
"
on
a
subject
that
is
very
important
to
us
both
.
<EOS>
My
sister
is
here
,
because
her
presence
helps
me
and
gives
me
confidence
.
<EOS>
She
has
not
suggested
one
word
of
what
I
am
going
to
say
 
I
speak
from
my
own
thoughts
,
not
from
hers
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
understand
that
before
I
go
any
farther
?
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
bowed
.
<EOS>
She
had
proceeded
thus
far
,
with
perfect
outward
tranquillity
and
perfect
propriety
of
manner
.
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
,
and
he
looked
at
her
.
<EOS>
They
seemed
,
at
the
outset
,
at
least
,
resolved
to
understand
one
another
plainly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
from
Marian
,
"
she
went
on
,
"
that
I
have
only
to
claim
my
release
from
our
engagement
to
obtain
that
release
from
you
.
<EOS>
It
was
forbearing
and
generous
on
your
part
,
Sir
Percival
,
to
send
me
such
a
message
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
doing
you
justice
to
say
that
I
am
grateful
for
the
offer
,
and
I
hope
and
believe
that
it
is
only
doing
myself
justice
to
tell
you
that
I
decline
to
accept
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
attentive
face
relaxed
a
little
.
<EOS>
But
I
saw
one
of
his
feet
,
softly
,
quietly
,
incessantly
beating
on
the
carpet
under
the
table
,
and
I
felt
that
he
was
secretly
as
anxious
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
forgotten
,
"
she
said
,
"
that
you
asked
my
father
's
permission
before
you
honoured
me
with
a
proposal
of
marriage
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
have
not
forgotten
either
what
I
said
when
I
consented
to
our
engagement
?
<EOS>
I
ventured
to
tell
you
that
my
father
's
influence
and
advice
had
mainly
decided
me
to
give
you
my
promise
.
<EOS>
I
was
guided
by
my
father
,
because
I
had
always
found
him
the
truest
of
all
advisers
,
the
best
and
fondest
of
all
protectors
and
friends
.
<EOS>
I
have
lost
him
now
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
his
memory
to
love
,
but
my
faith
in
that
dear
dead
friend
has
never
been
shaken
.
<EOS>
I
believe
at
this
moment
,
as
truly
as
I
ever
believed
,
that
he
knew
what
was
best
,
and
that
his
hopes
and
wishes
ought
to
be
my
hopes
and
wishes
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
voice
trembled
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
Her
restless
fingers
stole
their
way
into
my
lap
,
and
held
fast
by
one
of
my
hands
.
<EOS>
There
was
another
moment
of
silence
,
and
then
Sir
Percival
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
,
"
he
said
,
"
if
I
have
ever
proved
myself
unworthy
of
the
trust
which
it
has
been
hitherto
my
greatest
honour
and
greatest
happiness
to
possess
?
"
  
"
I
have
found
nothing
in
your
conduct
to
blame
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
always
treated
me
with
the
same
delicacy
and
the
same
forbearance
.
<EOS>
You
have
deserved
my
trust
,
and
,
what
is
of
far
more
importance
in
my
estimation
,
you
have
deserved
my
father
's
trust
,
out
of
which
mine
grew
.
<EOS>
You
have
given
me
no
excuse
,
even
if
I
had
wanted
to
find
one
,
for
asking
to
be
released
from
my
pledge
.
<EOS>
What
I
have
said
so
far
has
been
spoken
with
the
wish
to
acknowledge
my
whole
obligation
to
you
.
<EOS>
My
regard
for
that
obligation
,
my
regard
for
my
father
's
memory
,
and
my
regard
for
my
own
promise
,
all
forbid
me
to
set
the
example
,
on
my
side
,
of
withdrawing
from
our
present
position
.
<EOS>
The
breaking
of
our
engagement
must
be
entirely
your
wish
and
your
act
,
Sir
Percival
 
not
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
uneasy
beating
of
his
foot
suddenly
stopped
,
and
he
leaned
forward
eagerly
across
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
act
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
reason
can
there
be
on
my
side
for
withdrawing
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
heard
her
breath
quickening
 
<EOS>
I
felt
her
hand
growing
cold
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
what
she
had
said
to
me
when
we
were
alone
,
I
began
to
be
afraid
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
was
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
reason
that
it
is
very
hard
to
tell
you
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
change
in
me
,
Sir
Percival
 
a
change
which
is
serious
enough
to
justify
you
,
to
yourself
and
to
me
,
in
breaking
off
our
engagement
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
face
turned
so
pale
again
that
even
his
lips
lost
their
colour
.
<EOS>
He
raised
the
arm
which
lay
on
the
table
,
turned
a
little
away
in
his
chair
,
and
supported
his
head
on
his
hand
,
so
that
his
profile
only
was
presented
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
change
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
The
tone
in
which
he
put
the
question
jarred
on
me
 
there
was
something
painfully
suppressed
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
sighed
heavily
,
and
leaned
towards
me
a
little
,
so
as
to
rest
her
shoulder
against
mine
.
<EOS>
I
felt
her
trembling
,
and
tried
to
spare
her
by
speaking
myself
.
<EOS>
She
stopped
me
by
a
warning
pressure
of
her
hand
,
and
then
addressed
Sir
Percival
one
more
,
but
this
time
without
looking
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
,
"
she
said
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
believe
it
,
that
the
fondest
and
truest
of
all
affections
is
the
affection
which
a
woman
ought
to
bear
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
When
our
engagement
began
that
affection
was
mine
to
give
,
if
I
could
,
and
yours
to
win
,
if
you
could
.
<EOS>
Will
you
pardon
me
,
and
spare
me
,
Sir
Percival
,
if
I
acknowledge
that
it
is
not
so
any
longer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
few
tears
gathered
in
her
eyes
,
and
dropped
over
her
cheeks
slowly
as
she
paused
and
waited
for
his
answer
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
utter
a
word
.
<EOS>
At
the
beginning
of
her
reply
he
had
moved
the
hand
on
which
his
head
rested
,
so
that
it
hid
his
face
.
<EOS>
I
saw
nothing
but
the
upper
part
of
his
figure
at
the
table
.
<EOS>
Not
a
muscle
of
him
moved
.
<EOS>
The
fingers
of
the
hand
which
supported
his
head
were
dented
deep
in
his
hair
.
<EOS>
They
might
have
expressed
hidden
anger
or
hidden
grief
 
<EOS>
it
was
hard
to
say
which
 
there
was
no
significant
trembling
in
them
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
,
absolutely
nothing
,
to
tell
the
secret
of
his
thoughts
at
that
moment
 
the
moment
which
was
the
crisis
of
his
life
and
the
crisis
of
hers
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
determined
to
make
him
declare
himself
,
for
Laura
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Percival
!
<EOS>
"
I
interposed
sharply
,
"
have
you
nothing
to
say
when
my
sister
has
said
so
much
?
<EOS>
More
,
in
my
opinion
,
"
I
added
,
my
unlucky
temper
getting
the
better
of
me
,
"
than
any
man
alive
,
in
your
position
,
has
a
right
to
hear
from
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
That
last
rash
sentence
opened
a
way
for
him
by
which
to
escape
me
if
he
chose
,
and
he
instantly
took
advantage
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
he
said
,
still
keeping
his
hand
over
his
face
,
"
pardon
me
if
I
remind
you
that
I
have
claimed
no
such
right
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
few
plain
words
which
would
have
brought
him
back
to
the
point
from
which
he
had
wandered
were
just
on
my
lips
,
when
Laura
checked
me
by
speaking
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
have
not
made
my
painful
acknowledgment
in
vain
,
"
she
continued
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
has
secured
me
your
entire
confidence
in
what
I
have
still
to
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
be
assured
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
He
made
that
brief
reply
warmly
,
dropping
his
hand
on
the
table
while
he
spoke
,
and
turning
towards
us
again
.
<EOS>
Whatever
outward
change
had
passed
over
him
was
gone
now
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
eager
and
expectant
 
<EOS>
it
expressed
nothing
but
the
most
intense
anxiety
to
hear
her
next
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
to
understand
that
I
have
not
spoken
from
any
selfish
motive
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
leave
me
,
Sir
Percival
,
after
what
you
have
just
heard
,
you
do
not
leave
me
to
marry
another
man
,
you
only
allow
me
to
remain
a
single
woman
for
the
rest
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
My
fault
towards
you
has
begun
and
ended
in
my
own
thoughts
.
<EOS>
It
can
never
go
any
farther
.
<EOS>
No
word
has
passed
 
"
She
hesitated
,
in
doubt
about
the
expression
she
should
use
next
,
hesitated
in
a
momentary
confusion
which
it
was
very
sad
and
very
painful
to
see
.
"
<EOS>
No
word
has
passed
,
"
she
patiently
and
resolutely
resumed
,
"
between
myself
and
the
person
to
whom
I
am
now
referring
for
the
first
and
last
time
in
your
presence
of
my
feelings
towards
him
,
or
of
his
feelings
towards
me
 
<EOS>
no
word
ever
can
pass
 
neither
he
nor
I
are
likely
,
in
this
world
,
to
meet
again
.
<EOS>
I
earnestly
beg
you
to
spare
me
from
saying
any
more
,
and
to
believe
me
,
on
my
word
,
in
what
I
have
just
told
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
,
the
truth
which
I
think
my
promised
husband
has
a
claim
to
hear
,
at
any
sacrifice
of
my
own
feelings
.
<EOS>
I
trust
to
his
generosity
to
pardon
me
,
and
to
his
honour
to
keep
my
secret
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Both
those
trusts
are
sacred
to
me
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
both
shall
be
sacredly
kept
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
answering
in
those
terms
he
paused
,
and
looked
at
her
as
if
he
was
waiting
to
hear
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
said
all
I
wish
to
say
,
"
she
added
quietly
 
"
I
have
said
more
than
enough
to
justify
you
in
withdrawing
from
your
engagement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
said
more
than
enough
,
"
he
answered
,
"
to
make
it
the
dearest
object
of
my
life
to
KEEP
the
engagement
.
"
<EOS>
With
those
words
he
rose
from
his
chair
,
and
advanced
a
few
steps
towards
the
place
where
she
was
sitting
.
  
<EOS>
She
started
violently
,
and
a
faint
cry
of
surprise
escaped
her
.
<EOS>
Every
word
she
had
spoken
had
innocently
betrayed
her
purity
and
truth
to
a
man
who
thoroughly
understood
the
priceless
value
of
a
pure
and
true
woman
.
<EOS>
Her
own
noble
conduct
had
been
the
hidden
enemy
,
throughout
,
of
all
the
hopes
she
had
trusted
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
had
dreaded
this
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
prevented
it
,
if
she
had
allowed
me
the
smallest
chance
of
doing
so
.
<EOS>
I
even
waited
and
watched
now
,
when
the
harm
was
done
,
for
a
word
from
Sir
Percival
that
would
give
me
the
opportunity
of
putting
him
in
the
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
left
it
to
ME
,
Miss
Fairlie
,
to
resign
you
,
"
he
continued
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
heartless
enough
to
resign
a
woman
who
has
just
shown
herself
to
be
the
noblest
of
her
sex
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
spoke
with
such
warmth
and
feeling
,
with
such
passionate
enthusiasm
,
and
yet
with
such
perfect
delicacy
,
that
she
raised
her
head
,
flushed
up
a
little
,
and
looked
at
him
with
sudden
animation
and
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
The
most
wretched
of
her
sex
,
if
she
must
give
herself
in
marriage
when
she
can
not
give
her
love
.
"
  
"
May
she
not
give
it
in
the
future
,
"
he
asked
,
"
if
the
one
object
of
her
husband
's
life
is
to
deserve
it
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Never
!
"
<EOS>
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
still
persist
in
maintaining
our
engagement
,
I
may
be
your
true
and
faithful
wife
,
Sir
Percival
 
<EOS>
your
loving
wife
,
if
I
know
my
own
heart
,
never
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
so
irresistibly
beautiful
as
she
said
those
brave
words
that
no
man
alive
could
have
steeled
his
heart
against
her
.
<EOS>
I
tried
hard
to
feel
that
Sir
Percival
was
to
blame
,
and
to
say
so
,
but
my
womanhood
would
pity
him
,
in
spite
of
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
gratefully
accept
your
faith
and
truth
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
The
least
that
you
can
offer
is
more
to
me
than
the
utmost
that
I
could
hope
for
from
any
other
woman
in
the
world
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
left
hand
still
held
mine
,
but
her
right
hand
hung
listlessly
at
her
side
.
<EOS>
He
raised
it
gently
to
his
lips
 
touched
it
with
them
,
rather
than
kissed
it
 
bowed
to
me
 
<EOS>
and
then
,
with
perfect
delicacy
and
discretion
,
silently
quitted
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
She
neither
moved
nor
said
a
word
when
he
was
gone
 
<EOS>
she
sat
by
me
,
cold
and
still
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
I
saw
it
was
hopeless
and
useless
to
speak
,
and
I
only
put
my
arm
round
her
,
and
held
her
to
me
in
silence
.
<EOS>
We
remained
together
so
for
what
seemed
a
long
and
weary
time
 
so
long
and
so
weary
,
that
I
grew
uneasy
and
spoke
to
her
softly
,
in
the
hope
of
producing
a
change
.
  
<EOS>
The
sound
of
my
voice
seemed
to
startle
her
into
consciousness
.
<EOS>
She
suddenly
drew
herself
away
from
me
and
rose
to
her
feet
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
submit
,
Marian
,
as
well
as
I
can
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
My
new
life
has
its
hard
duties
,
and
one
of
them
begins
to
-
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
she
spoke
she
went
to
a
side
-
table
near
the
window
,
on
which
her
sketching
materials
were
placed
,
gathered
them
together
carefully
,
and
put
them
in
a
drawer
of
her
cabinet
.
<EOS>
She
locked
the
drawer
and
brought
the
key
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
part
from
everything
that
reminds
me
of
him
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Keep
the
key
wherever
you
please
 
I
shall
never
want
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Before
I
could
say
a
word
she
had
turned
away
to
her
book
-
case
,
and
had
taken
from
it
the
album
that
contained
Walter
Hartright
's
drawings
.
<EOS>
She
hesitated
for
a
moment
,
holding
the
little
volume
fondly
in
her
hands
 
then
lifted
it
to
her
lips
and
kissed
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Laura
!
<EOS>
Laura
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
not
angrily
,
not
reprovingly
 
with
nothing
but
sorrow
in
my
voice
,
and
nothing
but
sorrow
in
my
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
last
time
,
Marian
,
"
she
pleaded
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
bidding
it
good
-
bye
for
ever
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
laid
the
book
on
the
table
and
drew
out
the
comb
that
fastened
her
hair
.
<EOS>
It
fell
,
in
its
matchless
beauty
,
over
her
back
and
shoulders
,
and
dropped
round
her
,
far
below
her
waist
.
<EOS>
She
separated
one
long
,
thin
lock
from
the
rest
,
cut
it
off
,
and
pinned
it
carefully
,
in
the
form
of
a
circle
,
on
the
first
blank
page
of
the
album
.
<EOS>
The
moment
it
was
fastened
she
closed
the
volume
hurriedly
,
and
placed
it
in
my
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
write
to
him
and
he
writes
to
you
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
While
I
am
alive
,
if
he
asks
after
me
always
tell
him
I
am
well
,
and
never
say
I
am
unhappy
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
distress
him
,
Marian
,
for
my
sake
,
do
n't
distress
him
.
<EOS>
If
I
die
first
,
promise
you
will
give
him
this
little
book
of
his
drawings
,
with
my
hair
in
it
.
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
harm
,
when
I
am
gone
,
in
telling
him
that
I
put
it
there
with
my
own
hands
.
<EOS>
And
say
 
oh
,
Marian
,
say
for
me
,
then
,
what
I
can
never
say
for
myself
 
say
I
loved
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
flung
her
arms
round
my
neck
,
and
whispered
the
last
words
in
my
ear
with
a
passionate
delight
in
uttering
them
which
it
almost
broke
my
heart
to
hear
.
<EOS>
All
the
long
restraint
she
had
imposed
on
herself
gave
way
in
that
first
last
outburst
of
tenderness
.
<EOS>
She
broke
from
me
with
hysterical
vehemence
,
and
threw
herself
on
the
sofa
in
a
paroxysm
of
sobs
and
tears
that
shook
her
from
head
to
foot
.
  
<EOS>
I
tried
vainly
to
soothe
her
and
reason
with
her
 
<EOS>
she
was
past
being
soothed
,
and
past
being
reasoned
with
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
sad
,
sudden
end
for
us
two
of
this
memorable
day
.
<EOS>
When
the
fit
had
worn
itself
out
<EOS>
she
was
too
exhausted
to
speak
.
<EOS>
She
slumbered
towards
the
afternoon
,
and
I
put
away
the
book
of
drawings
so
that
she
might
not
see
it
when
she
woke
.
<EOS>
My
face
was
calm
,
whatever
my
heart
might
be
,
when
she
opened
her
eyes
again
and
looked
at
me
.
<EOS>
We
said
no
more
to
each
other
about
the
distressing
interview
of
the
morning
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
's
name
was
not
mentioned
.
<EOS>
Walter
Hartright
was
not
alluded
to
again
by
either
of
us
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
10th
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
that
she
was
composed
<EOS>
and
like
herself
this
morning
,
I
returned
to
the
painful
subject
of
yesterday
,
for
the
sole
purpose
of
imploring
her
to
let
me
speak
to
Sir
Percival
and
Mr.
Fairlie
,
more
plainly
and
strongly
than
she
could
speak
to
either
of
them
herself
,
about
this
lamentable
marriage
.
<EOS>
She
interposed
,
gently
but
firmly
,
in
the
middle
of
my
remonstrances
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
left
yesterday
to
decide
,
"
she
said
;
"
and
yesterday
HAS
decided
.
<EOS>
It
is
too
late
to
go
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
spoke
to
me
this
afternoon
about
what
had
passed
in
Laura
's
room
.
<EOS>
He
assured
me
that
the
unparalleled
trust
she
had
placed
in
him
had
awakened
such
an
answering
conviction
of
her
innocence
and
integrity
in
his
mind
,
that
he
was
guiltless
of
having
felt
even
a
moment
's
unworthy
jealousy
,
either
at
the
time
when
he
was
in
her
presence
,
or
afterwards
when
he
had
withdrawn
from
it
.
<EOS>
Deeply
as
he
lamented
the
unfortunate
attachment
which
had
hindered
the
progress
he
might
otherwise
have
made
in
her
esteem
and
regard
,
he
firmly
believed
that
it
had
remained
unacknowledged
in
the
past
,
and
that
it
would
remain
,
under
all
changes
of
circumstance
which
it
was
possible
to
contemplate
,
unacknowledged
in
the
future
.
<EOS>
This
was
his
absolute
conviction
;
and
the
strongest
proof
he
could
give
of
it
was
the
assurance
,
which
he
now
offered
,
that
he
felt
no
curiosity
to
know
whether
the
attachment
was
of
recent
date
or
not
,
or
who
had
been
the
object
of
it
.
<EOS>
His
implicit
confidence
in
Miss
Fairlie
made
him
satisfied
with
what
she
had
thought
fit
to
say
to
him
,
and
he
was
honestly
innocent
of
the
slightest
feeling
of
anxiety
to
hear
more
.
  
<EOS>
He
waited
after
saying
those
words
and
looked
at
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
conscious
of
my
unreasonable
prejudice
against
him
 
so
conscious
of
an
unworthy
suspicion
that
he
might
be
speculating
on
my
impulsively
answering
the
very
questions
which
he
had
just
described
himself
as
resolved
not
to
ask
 
that
I
evaded
all
reference
to
this
part
of
the
subject
with
something
like
a
feeling
of
confusion
on
my
own
part
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
I
was
resolved
not
to
lose
even
the
smallest
opportunity
of
trying
to
plead
Laura
's
cause
,
and
I
told
him
boldly
that
I
regretted
his
generosity
had
not
carried
him
one
step
farther
,
and
induced
him
to
withdraw
from
the
engagement
altogether
.
  
<EOS>
Here
,
again
,
he
disarmed
me
by
not
attempting
to
defend
himself
.
<EOS>
He
would
merely
beg
me
to
remember
the
difference
there
was
between
his
allowing
Miss
Fairlie
to
give
him
up
,
which
was
a
matter
of
submission
only
,
and
his
forcing
himself
to
give
up
Miss
Fairlie
,
which
was
,
in
other
words
,
asking
him
to
be
the
suicide
of
his
own
hopes
.
<EOS>
Her
conduct
of
the
day
before
had
so
strengthened
the
unchangeable
love
and
admiration
of
two
long
years
,
that
all
active
contention
against
those
feelings
,
on
his
part
,
was
henceforth
entirely
out
of
his
power
.
<EOS>
I
must
think
him
weak
,
selfish
,
unfeeling
towards
the
very
woman
whom
he
idolised
,
and
he
must
bow
to
my
opinion
as
resignedly
as
he
could
 
only
putting
it
to
me
,
at
the
same
time
,
whether
her
future
as
a
single
woman
,
pining
under
an
unhappily
placed
attachment
which
she
could
never
acknowledge
,
could
be
said
to
promise
her
a
much
brighter
prospect
than
her
future
as
the
wife
of
a
man
who
worshipped
the
very
ground
she
walked
on
?
<EOS>
In
the
last
case
there
was
hope
from
time
,
however
slight
it
might
be
 
in
the
first
case
,
on
her
own
showing
,
there
was
no
hope
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
I
answered
him
 
more
because
my
tongue
is
a
woman
's
,
and
must
answer
,
than
because
I
had
anything
convincing
to
say
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
too
plain
that
the
course
Laura
had
adopted
the
day
before
had
offered
him
the
advantage
if
he
chose
to
take
it
 
and
that
he
HAD
chosen
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
I
felt
this
at
the
time
,
and
I
feel
it
just
as
strongly
now
,
while
I
write
these
lines
,
in
my
own
room
.
<EOS>
The
one
hope
left
is
that
his
motives
really
spring
,
as
he
says
they
do
,
from
the
irresistible
strength
of
his
attachment
to
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
Before
I
close
my
diary
for
to
-
night
<EOS>
I
must
record
that
I
wrote
to
-
day
,
in
poor
Hartright
's
interest
,
to
two
of
my
mother
's
old
friends
in
London
 
both
men
of
influence
and
position
.
<EOS>
If
they
can
do
anything
for
him
,
I
am
quite
sure
they
will
.
<EOS>
Except
Laura
,
I
never
was
more
anxious
about
any
one
than
I
am
now
about
Walter
.
<EOS>
All
that
has
happened
since
he
left
us
has
only
increased
my
strong
regard
and
sympathy
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
am
doing
right
in
trying
to
help
him
to
employment
abroad
 
<EOS>
I
hope
,
most
earnestly
and
anxiously
,
that
it
will
end
well
.

11th

<EOS>
Sir
Percival
had
an
interview
with
Mr.
Fairlie
,
and
I
was
sent
for
to
join
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
Mr.
Fairlie
greatly
relieved
at
the
prospect
of
the
"
family
worry
"
(
as
he
was
pleased
to
describe
his
niece
's
marriage
)
being
settled
at
last
.
<EOS>
So
far
,
I
did
not
feel
called
on
to
say
anything
to
him
about
my
own
opinion
,
but
when
he
proceeded
,
in
his
most
aggravatingly
languid
manner
,
to
suggest
that
the
time
for
the
marriage
had
better
be
settled
next
,
in
accordance
with
Sir
Percival
's
wishes
,
I
enjoyed
the
satisfaction
of
assailing
Mr.
Fairlie
's
nerves
with
as
strong
a
protest
against
hurrying
Laura
's
decision
as
I
could
put
into
words
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
immediately
assured
me
that
he
felt
the
force
of
my
objection
,
and
begged
me
to
believe
that
the
proposal
had
not
been
made
in
consequence
of
any
interference
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
leaned
back
in
his
chair
,
closed
his
eyes
,
said
we
both
of
us
did
honour
to
human
nature
,
and
then
repeated
his
suggestion
as
coolly
as
if
neither
Sir
Percival
nor
I
had
said
a
word
in
opposition
to
it
.
<EOS>
It
ended
in
my
flatly
declining
to
mention
the
subject
to
Laura
,
unless
she
first
approached
it
of
her
own
accord
.
<EOS>
I
left
the
room
at
once
after
making
that
declaration
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
looked
seriously
embarrassed
and
distressed
,
Mr.
Fairlie
stretched
out
his
lazy
legs
on
his
velvet
footstool
,
and
said
,
"
Dear
Marian
!
<EOS>
how
I
envy
you
your
robust
nervous
system
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
bang
the
door
!
"
  
<EOS>
On
going
to
Laura
's
room
I
found
that
she
had
asked
for
me
,
and
that
Mrs.
Vesey
had
informed
her
that
I
was
with
Mr.
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
She
inquired
at
once
what
I
had
been
wanted
for
,
and
I
told
her
all
that
had
passed
,
without
attempting
to
conceal
the
vexation
and
annoyance
that
I
really
felt
.
<EOS>
Her
answer
surprised
and
distressed
me
inexpressibly
 
<EOS>
it
was
the
very
last
reply
that
I
should
have
expected
her
to
make
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
is
right
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
caused
trouble
and
anxiety
enough
to
you
,
and
to
all
about
me
.
<EOS>
Let
me
cause
no
more
<EOS>
,
Marian
 
let
Sir
Percival
decide
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
remonstrated
warmly
,
but
nothing
that
I
could
say
moved
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
held
to
my
engagement
,
"
she
replied
;
"
I
have
broken
with
my
old
life
.
<EOS>
The
evil
day
will
not
come
the
less
surely
because
I
put
it
off
.
<EOS>
No
,
Marian
!
<EOS>
once
again
my
uncle
is
right
.
<EOS>
I
have
caused
trouble
enough
and
anxiety
enough
,
and
I
will
cause
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
used
to
be
pliability
itself
,
but
she
was
now
inflexibly
passive
in
her
resignation
 
<EOS>
I
might
almost
say
in
her
despair
.
<EOS>
Dearly
as
I
love
her
,
I
should
have
been
less
pained
if
she
had
been
violently
agitated
 
<EOS>
it
was
so
shockingly
unlike
her
natural
character
to
see
her
as
cold
and
insensible
as
I
saw
her
now
.
  
<EOS>
12th
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
put
some
questions
to
me
at
breakfast
about
Laura
,
which
left
me
no
choice
but
to
tell
him
what
she
had
said
.
  
<EOS>
While
we
were
talking
she
herself
came
down
and
joined
us
.
<EOS>
She
was
just
as
unnaturally
composed
in
Sir
Percival
's
presence
as
she
had
been
in
mine
.
<EOS>
When
breakfast
was
over
he
had
an
opportunity
of
saying
a
few
words
to
her
privately
,
in
a
recess
of
one
of
the
windows
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
more
than
two
or
three
minutes
together
,
and
on
their
separating
she
left
the
room
with
Mrs.
Vesey
,
while
Sir
Percival
came
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
said
he
had
entreated
her
to
favour
him
by
maintaining
her
privilege
of
fixing
the
time
for
the
marriage
at
her
own
will
and
pleasure
.
<EOS>
In
reply
she
had
merely
expressed
her
acknowledgments
,
and
had
desired
him
to
mention
what
his
wishes
were
to
Miss
Halcombe
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
patience
to
write
more
.
<EOS>
In
this
instance
,
as
in
every
other
,
Sir
Percival
has
carried
his
point
with
the
utmost
possible
credit
to
himself
,
in
spite
of
everything
that
I
can
say
or
do
.
<EOS>
His
wishes
are
now
,
what
they
were
,
of
course
,
when
he
first
came
here
;
and
Laura
having
resigned
herself
to
the
one
inevitable
sacrifice
of
the
marriage
,
remains
as
coldly
hopeless
and
enduring
as
ever
.
<EOS>
In
parting
with
the
little
occupations
and
relics
that
reminded
her
of
Hartright
,
she
seems
to
have
parted
with
all
her
tenderness
and
all
her
impressibility
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
while
I
write
these
lines
,
and
Sir
Percival
has
left
us
already
,
in
the
happy
hurry
of
a
bridegroom
,
to
prepare
for
the
bride
's
reception
at
his
house
in
Hampshire
.
<EOS>
Unless
some
extraordinary
event
happens
to
prevent
it
they
will
be
married
exactly
at
the
time
when
he
wished
to
be
married
 
before
the
end
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
My
very
fingers
burn
as
I
write
it
!
  
<EOS>
13th
.
 
<EOS>
A
sleepless
night
,
through
uneasiness
about
Laura
.
<EOS>
Towards
the
morning
I
came
to
a
resolution
to
try
what
change
of
scene
would
do
to
rouse
her
.
<EOS>
She
can
not
surely
remain
in
her
present
torpor
of
insensibility
,
if
I
take
her
away
from
Limmeridge
and
surround
her
with
the
pleasant
faces
of
old
friends
?
<EOS>
After
some
consideration
I
decided
on
writing
to
the
Arnolds
,
in
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
They
are
simple
,
kind
-
hearted
,
hospitable
people
,
and
she
has
known
them
from
her
childhood
.
<EOS>
When
I
had
put
the
letter
in
the
post
-
bag
I
told
her
what
I
had
done
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
a
relief
to
me
if
she
had
shown
the
spirit
to
resist
and
object
.
<EOS>
But
no
 
<EOS>
she
only
said
,
"
I
will
go
anywhere
with
you
,
Marian
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
are
right
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
the
change
will
do
me
good
.
"
  
<EOS>
14th
.
 
<EOS>
I
wrote
to
Mr.
Gilmore
,
informing
him
that
there
was
really
a
prospect
of
this
miserable
marriage
taking
place
,
and
also
mentioning
my
idea
of
trying
what
change
of
scene
would
do
for
Laura
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
heart
to
go
into
particulars
.
<EOS>
Time
enough
for
them
when
we
get
nearer
to
the
end
of
the
year
.
  
<EOS>
15th
.
 
<EOS>
Three
letters
for
me
.
<EOS>
The
first
,
from
the
Arnolds
,
full
of
delight
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
Laura
and
me
.
<EOS>
The
second
,
from
one
of
the
gentlemen
to
whom
I
wrote
on
Walter
Hartright
's
behalf
,
informing
me
that
he
has
been
fortunate
enough
to
find
an
opportunity
of
complying
with
my
request
.
<EOS>
The
third
,
from
Walter
himself
,
thanking
me
,
poor
fellow
,
in
the
warmest
terms
,
for
giving
him
an
opportunity
of
leaving
his
home
,
his
country
,
and
his
friends
.
<EOS>
A
private
expedition
to
make
excavations
among
the
ruined
cities
of
Central
America
is
,
it
seems
,
about
to
sail
from
Liverpool
.
<EOS>
The
draughtsman
who
had
been
already
appointed
to
accompany
it
has
lost
heart
,
and
withdrawn
at
the
eleventh
hour
,
and
Walter
is
to
fill
his
place
.
<EOS>
He
is
to
be
engaged
for
six
months
certain
,
from
the
time
of
the
landing
in
Honduras
,
and
for
a
year
afterwards
,
if
the
excavations
are
successful
,
and
if
the
funds
hold
out
.
<EOS>
His
letter
ends
with
a
promise
to
write
me
a
farewell
line
when
they
are
all
on
board
ship
,
and
when
the
pilot
leaves
them
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
hope
and
pray
earnestly
that
he
and
I
are
both
acting
in
this
matter
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
It
seems
such
a
serious
step
for
him
to
take
,
that
the
mere
contemplation
of
it
startles
me
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
in
his
unhappy
position
,
how
can
I
expect
him
or
wish
him
to
remain
at
home
?

<EOS>
A

hearted

has

some
good

not
so
much
as
I

hoped

<EOS>
I
have
resolved
to
prolong
our
stay
for
another

It

Sad

We

Sad
news
yesterday
 
ominous
news
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
Glyde
has
written
to
Mr.
Fairlie
,
and
Mr.
Fairlie
has
written
to
Laura
and
me
,
to
recall
us
to
Limmeridge
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
What
can
this
mean
?
<EOS>
Has
the
day
for
the
marriage
been
fixed
in
our
absence
?
    
<EOS>
LIMMERIDGE
HOUSE
.
  
<EOS>
November
27th
.
 
<EOS>
My
forebodings
are
realised
.
<EOS>
The
marriage
is
fixed
for
the
twenty
-
second
of
December
.
  
<EOS>
The
day
after
we
left
for
Polesdean
Lodge
Sir
Percival
wrote
,
it
seems
,
to
Mr.
Fairlie
,
to
say
that
the
necessary
repairs
and
alterations
in
his
house
in
Hampshire
would
occupy
a
much
longer
time
in
completion
than
he
had
originally
anticipated
.
<EOS>
The
proper
estimates
were
to
be
submitted
to
him
as
soon
as
possible
,
and
it
would
greatly
facilitate
his
entering
into
definite
arrangements
with
the
workpeople
,
if
he
could
be
informed
of
the
exact
period
at
which
the
wedding
ceremony
might
be
expected
to
take
place
.
<EOS>
He
could
then
make
all
his
calculations
in
reference
to
time
,
besides
writing
the
necessary
apologies
to
friends
who
had
been
engaged
to
visit
him
that
winter
,
and
who
could
not
,
of
course
,
be
received
when
the
house
was
in
the
hands
of
the
workmen
.
  
<EOS>
To
this
letter
Mr.
Fairlie
had
replied
by
requesting
Sir
Percival
himself
to
suggest
a
day
for
the
marriage
,
subject
to
Miss
Fairlie
's
approval
,
which
her
guardian
willingly
undertook
to
do
his
best
to
obtain
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
wrote
back
by
the
next
post
,
and
proposed
(
in
accordance
with
his
own
views
and
wishes
from
the
first
?
)
<EOS>
the
latter
part
of
December
 
perhaps
the
twenty
-
second
,
or
twenty
-
fourth
,
or
any
other
day
that
the
lady
and
her
guardian
might
prefer
.
<EOS>
The
lady
not
being
at
hand
to
speak
for
herself
,
her
guardian
had
decided
,
in
her
absence
,
on
the
earliest
day
mentioned
 
the
twenty
-
second
of
December
,
and
had
written
to
recall
us
to
Limmeridge
in
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
After
explaining
these
particulars
to
me
at
a
private
interview
yesterday
,
Mr.
Fairlie
suggested
,
in
his
most
amiable
manner
,
that
I
should
open
the
necessary
negotiations
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Feeling
that
resistance
was
useless
,
unless
I
could
first
obtain
Laura
's
authority
to
make
it
,
I
consented
to
speak
to
her
,
but
declared
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
I
would
on
no
consideration
undertake
to
gain
her
consent
to
Sir
Percival
's

<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
complimented
me
on
my
"
excellent
conscience
,
"
much
as
he
would
have
complimented
me
,
if
he
had
been
out
walking
,
on
my
"
excellent
constitution
,
"
and
seemed
perfectly
satisfied
,
so
far
,
with
having
simply
shifted
one
more
family
responsibility
from
his
own
shoulders
to
mine
.
  
<EOS>
This
morning
I
spoke
to
Laura
as
I
had
promised
.
<EOS>
The
composure
 
<EOS>
I
may
almost
say
,
the
insensibility
 
which
she
has
so
strangely
and
so
resolutely
maintained
ever
since
Sir
Percival
left
us
,
was
not
proof
against
the
shock
of
the
news
I
had
to
tell
her
.
<EOS>
She
turned
pale
and
trembled
violently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
so
soon
!
"
she
pleaded
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Marian
,
not
so
soon
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
slightest
hint
she
could
give
was
enough
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
rose
to
leave
the
room
,
and
fight
her
battle
for
her
at
once
with
Mr.
Fairlie
.
  
<EOS>
Just
as
my
hand
was
on
the
door
,
she
caught
fast
hold
of
my
dress
and
stopped
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
!
"
<EOS>
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
My
tongue
burns
to
tell
your
uncle
that
he
and
Sir
Percival
are
not
to
have
it
all
their
own
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
sighed
bitterly
,
and
still
held
my
dress
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
faintly
.
<EOS>
"
Too
late
,
Marian
,
too
late
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
minute
too
late
,
"
I
retorted
.
<EOS>
"
The
question
of
time
is
OUR
question
 
and
trust
me
,
Laura
,
to
take
a
woman
's
full
advantage
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
unclasped
her
hand
from
my
gown
while
I
spoke
;
but
she
slipped
both
her
arms
round
my
waist
at
the
same
moment
,
and
held
me
more
effectually
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
only
involve
us
in
more
trouble
and
more
confusion
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
set
you
and
my
uncle
at
variance
,
and
bring
Sir
Percival
here
again
with
fresh
causes
of
complaint
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
So
much
the
better
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
cried
out
passionately
.
<EOS>
"
Who
cares
for
his
causes
of
complaint
?
<EOS>
Are
you
to
break
your
heart
to
set
his
mind
at
ease
?
<EOS>
No
man
under
heaven
deserves
these
sacrifices
from
us
women
.
<EOS>
Men
!
<EOS>
They
are
the
enemies
of
our
innocence
and
our
peace
 
they
drag
us
away
from
our
parents
'
love
and
our
sisters
'
friendship
 
<EOS>
they
take
us
body
and
soul
to
themselves
,
and
fasten
our
helpless
lives
to
theirs
as
they
chain
up
a
dog
to
his
kennel
.
<EOS>
And
what
does
the
best
of
them
give
us
in
return
?
<EOS>
Let
me
go
,
Laura
 
<EOS>
I
'm
mad
when
I
think
of
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
tears
 
miserable
,
weak
,
women
's
tears
of
vexation
and
rage
 
started
to
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
smiled
sadly
,
and
put
her
handkerchief
over
my
face
to
hide
for
me
the
betrayal
of
my
own
weakness
 
the
weakness
of
all
others
which
she
knew
that
I
most
despised
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Marian
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
crying
!
<EOS>
Think
what
you
would
say
to
me
,
if
the
places
were
changed
,
and
if
those
tears
were
mine
.
<EOS>
All
your
love
and
courage
and
devotion
will
not
alter
what
must
happen
,
sooner
or
later
.
<EOS>
Let
my
uncle
have
his
way
.
<EOS>
Let
us
have
no
more
troubles
and
heart
-
burnings
that
any
sacrifice
of
mine
can
prevent
.
<EOS>
Say
you
will
live
with
me
,
Marian
,
when
I
am
married
 
and
say
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
I
did
say
more
.
<EOS>
I
forced
back
the
contemptible
tears
that
were
no
relief
to
ME
,
and
that
only
distressed
HER
,
and
reasoned
and
pleaded
as
calmly
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
It
was
of
no
avail
.
<EOS>
She
made
me
twice
repeat
the
promise
to
live
with
her
when
she
was
married
,
and
then
suddenly
asked
a
question
which
turned
my
sorrow
and
my
sympathy
for
her
into
a
new
direction
.
  
<EOS>
"
While
we
were
at
Polesdean
,
"
she
said
,
"
you
had
a
letter
,
Marian
 
<EOS>
"
  
Her
altered
tone
 
<EOS>
the
abrupt
manner
in
which
she
looked
away
from
me
and
hid
her
face
on
my
shoulder
 
the
hesitation
which
silenced
her
before
she
had
completed
her
question
<EOS>
,
all
told
me
,
but
too
plainly
,
to
whom
the
half
-
expressed
inquiry
pointed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
,
Laura
,
that
you
and
I
were
never
to
refer
to
him
again
,
"
I
said
gently
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
a
letter
from
him
?
"
<EOS>
she
persisted
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
replied
,
"
if
you
must
know
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
write
to
him
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hesitated
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
afraid
to
tell
her
of
his
absence
from
England
,
or
of
the
manner
in
which
my
exertions
to
serve
his
new
hopes
and
projects
had
connected
me
with
his
departure
.
<EOS>
What
answer
could
I
make
?
<EOS>
He
was
gone
where
no
letters
could
reach
him
for
months
,
perhaps
for
years
,
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
I
do
mean
to
write
to
him
again
,
"
I
said
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
What
then
,
Laura
?
"
  
Her
cheek
grew
burning
hot
against
my
neck
,
and
her
arms
trembled
and
tightened
round
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
tell
him
about
THE
TWENTY
-
SECOND
,
"
she
whispered
.
<EOS>
"
Promise
,
Marian
 
pray
promise
you
will
not
even
mention
my
name
to
him
when
you
write
next
.
"
  
I
gave
the
promise
.
<EOS>
No
words
can
say
how
sorrowfully
I
gave
it
.
<EOS>
She
instantly
took
her
arm
from
my
waist
,
walked
away
to
the
window
,
and
stood
looking
out
with
her
back
to
me
.
<EOS>
After
a
moment
she
spoke
once
more
,
but
without
turning
round
,
without
allowing
me
to
catch
the
smallest
glimpse
of
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
to
my
uncle
's
room
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
say
that
I
consent
to
whatever
arrangement
he
may
think
best
?
<EOS>
Never
mind
leaving
me
,
Marian
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
better
alone
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
went
out
.
<EOS>
If
,
as
soon
as
I
got
into
the
passage
,
I
could
have
transported
Mr.
Fairlie
and
Sir
Percival
Glyde
to
the
uttermost
ends
of
the
earth
by
lifting
one
of
my
fingers
,
that
finger
would
have
been
raised
without
an
instant
's
hesitation
.
<EOS>
For
once
my
unhappy
temper
now
stood
my
friend
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
broken
down
altogether
and
burst
into
a
violent
fit
of
crying
,
if
my
tears
had
not
been
all
burnt
up
in
the
heat
of
my
anger
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
I
dashed
into
Mr.
Fairlie
's
room
 
called
to
him
as
harshly
as
possible
,
"
Laura
consents
to
the
twenty
-
second
"
 
and
dashed
out
again
without
waiting
for
a
word
of
answer
.
<EOS>
I
banged
the
door
after
me
,
and
I
hope
I
shattered
Mr.
Fairlie
's
nervous
system
for
the
rest
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
28th
.
 
<EOS>
This
morning
I
read
poor
Hartright
's
farewell
letter
over
again
,
a
doubt
having
crossed
my
mind
since
yesterday
,
whether
I
am
acting
wisely
in
concealing
the
fact
of
his
departure
from
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
On
reflection
,
I
still
think
I
am
right
.
<EOS>
The
allusions
in
his
letter
to
the
preparations
made
for
the
expedition
to
Central
America
,
all
show
that
the
leaders
of
it
know
it
to
be
dangerous
.
<EOS>
If
the
discovery
of
this
makes
me
uneasy
,
what
would
it
make
HER
?
<EOS>
It
is
bad
enough
to
feel
that
his
departure
has
deprived
us
of
the
friend
of
all
others
to
whose
devotion
we
could
trust
in
the
hour
of
need
,
if
ever
that
hour
comes
and
finds
us
helpless
;
but
it
is
far
worse
to
know
that
he
has
gone
from
us
to
face
the
perils
of
a
bad
climate
,
a
wild
country
,
and
a
disturbed
population
.
<EOS>
Surely
it
would
be
a
cruel
candour
to
tell
Laura
this
,
without
a
pressing
and
a
positive
necessity
for
it
?
  
<EOS>
I
almost
doubt
whether
I
ought
not
to
go
a
step
farther
,
and
burn
the
letter
at
once
,
for
fear
of
its
one
day
falling
into
wrong
hands
.
<EOS>
It
not
only
refers
to
Laura
in
terms
which
ought
to
remain
a
secret
for
ever
between
the
writer
and
me
,
but
it
reiterates
his
suspicion
 
<EOS>
so
obstinate
,
so
unaccountable
,
and
so
alarming
 
that
he
has
been
secretly
watched
since
he
left
Limmeridge
.
<EOS>
He
declares
that
he
saw
the
faces
of
the
two
strange
men
who
followed
him
about
the
streets
of
London
,
watching
him
among
the
crowd
which
gathered
at
Liverpool
to
see
the
expedition
embark
,
and
he
positively
asserts
that
he
heard
the
name
of
Anne
Catherick
pronounced
behind
him
as
he
got
into
the
boat
.
<EOS>
His
own
words
are
,
"
These
events
have
a
meaning
,
these
events
must
lead
to
a
result
.
<EOS>
The
mystery
of
Anne
Catherick
is
NOT
cleared
up
yet
.
<EOS>
She
may
never
cross
my
path
again
,
but
if
ever
she
crosses
yours
,
make
better
use
of
the
opportunity
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
than
I
made
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
speak
on
strong
conviction
 
<EOS>
I
entreat
you
to
remember
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
These
are
his
own
expressions
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
danger
of
my
forgetting
them
 
my
memory
is
only
too
ready
to
dwell
on
any
words
of
Hartright
's
that
refer
to
Anne
Catherick
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
danger
in
my
keeping
the
letter
.
<EOS>
The
merest
accident
might
place
it
at
the
mercy
of
strangers
.
<EOS>
I
may
fall
ill
 
<EOS>
I
may
die
.
<EOS>
Better
to
burn
it
at
once
,
and
have
one
anxiety
the
less
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
burnt
.
<EOS>
The
ashes
of
his
farewell
letter
 
the
last
he
may
ever
write
to
me
 
lie
in
a
few
black
fragments
on
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
Is
this
the
sad
end
to
all
that
sad
story
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
not
the
end
 
surely
,
surely
not
the
end
already
!
  
<EOS>
29th
.
 
<EOS>
The
preparations
for
the
marriage
have
begun
.
<EOS>
The
dressmaker
has
come
to
receive
her
orders
.
<EOS>
Laura
is
perfectly
impassive
,
perfectly
careless
about
the
question
of
all
others
in
which
a
woman
's
personal
interests
are
most
closely
bound
up
.
<EOS>
She
has
left
it
all
to
the
dressmaker
and
to
me
.
<EOS>
If
poor
Hartright
had
been
the
baronet
,
and
the
husband
of
her
father
's
choice
,
how
differently
she
would
have
behaved
!
<EOS>
How
anxious
and
capricious
she
would
have
been
,
and
what
a
hard
task
the
best
of
dressmakers
would
have
found
it
to
please
her
!
  
<EOS>
30th
.
 
<EOS>
We
hear
every
day
from
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
The
last
news
is
that
the
alterations
in
his
house
will
occupy
from
four
to
six
months
before
they
can
be
properly
completed
.
<EOS>
If
painters
,
paperhangers
,
and
upholsterers
could
make
happiness
as
well
as
splendour
,
I
should
be
interested
about
their
proceedings
in
Laura
's
future
home
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
the
only
part
of
Sir
Percival
's
last
letter
which
does
not
leave
me
as
it
found
me
,
perfectly
indifferent
to
all
his
plans
and
projects
,
is
the
part
which
refers
to
the
wedding
tour
.
<EOS>
He
proposes
,
as
Laura
is
delicate
,
and
as
the
winter
threatens
to
be
unusually
severe
,
to
take
her
to
Rome
,
and
to
remain
in
Italy
until
the
early
part
of
next
summer
.
<EOS>
If
this
plan
should
not
be
approved
,
he
is
equally
ready
,
although
he
has
no
establishment
of
his
own
in
town
,
to
spend
the
season
in
London
,
in
the
most
suitable
furnished
house
that
can
be
obtained
for
the
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
Putting
myself
and
my
own
feelings
entirely
out
of
the
question
(
which
it
is
my
duty
to
do
,
and
which
I
have
done
)
,
I
,
for
one
,
have
no
doubt
of
the
propriety
of
adopting
the
first
of
these
proposals
.
<EOS>
In
either
case
a
separation
between
Laura
and
me
is
inevitable
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
longer
separation
,
in
the
event
of
their
going
abroad
,
than
it
would
be
in
the
event
of
their
remaining
in
London
 
<EOS>
but
we
must
set
against
this
disadvantage
the
benefit
to
Laura
,
on
the
other
side
,
of
passing
the
winter
in
a
mild
climate
,
and
more
than
that
,
the
immense
assistance
in
raising
her
spirits
,
and
reconciling
her
to
her
new
existence
,
which
the
mere
wonder
and
excitement
of
travelling
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
in
the
most
interesting
country
in
the
world
,
must
surely
afford
.
<EOS>
She
is
not
of
a
disposition
to
find
resources
in
the
conventional
gaieties
and
excitements
of
London
.
<EOS>
They
would
only
make
the
first
oppression
of
this
lamentable
marriage
fall
the
heavier
on
her
.
<EOS>
I
dread
the
beginning
of
her
new
life
more
than
words
can
tell
,
but
I
see
some
hope
for
her
if
she
travels
 
none
if
she
remains
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
strange
to
look
back
at
this
latest
entry
in
my
journal
,
and
to
find
that
I
am
writing
of
the
marriage
and
the
parting
with
Laura
,
as
people
write
of
a
settled
thing
.
<EOS>
It
seems
so
cold
and
so
unfeeling
to
be
looking
at
the
future
already
in
this
cruelly
composed
way
.
<EOS>
But
what
other
way
is
possible
,
now
that
the
time
is
drawing
so
near
?
<EOS>
Before
another
month
is
over
our
heads
she
will
be
HIS
Laura
instead
of
mine
!
<EOS>
HIS
Laura
!
<EOS>
I
am
as
little
able
to
realise
the
idea
which
those
two
words
convey
 
<EOS>
my
mind
feels
almost
as
dulled
and
stunned
by
it
 
as
if
writing
of
her
marriage
were
like
writing
of
her
death
.
  
<EOS>
December
1st
.
 
<EOS>
A
sad
,
sad
day
 
a
day
that
I
have
no
heart
to
describe
at
any
length
.
<EOS>
After
weakly
putting
it
off
last
night
,
I
was
obliged
to
speak
to
her
this
morning
of
Sir
Percival
's
proposal
about
the
wedding
tour
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
full
conviction
that
I
should
be
with
her
wherever
she
went
,
the
poor
child
 
for
a
child
<EOS>
she
is
still
in
many
things
 
was
almost
happy
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
the
wonders
of
Florence
and
Rome
and
Naples
.
<EOS>
It
nearly
broke
my
heart
to
dispel
her
delusion
,
and
to
bring
her
face
to
face
with
the
hard
truth
.
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
tell
her
that
no
man
tolerates
a
rival
 
not
even
a
woman
rival
 
in
his
wife
's
affections
,
when
he
first
marries
,
whatever
he
may
do
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
warn
her
that
my
chance
of
living
with
her
permanently
under
her
own
roof
,
depended
entirely
on
my
not
arousing
Sir
Percival
's
jealousy
and
distrust
by
standing
between
them
at
the
beginning
of
their
marriage
,
in
the
position
of
the
chosen
depositary
of
his
wife
's
closest
secrets
.
<EOS>
Drop
by
drop
<EOS>
I
poured
the
profaning
bitterness
of
this
world
's
wisdom
into
that
pure
heart
and
that
innocent
mind
,
while
every
higher
and
better
feeling
within
me
recoiled
from
my
miserable
task
.
<EOS>
It
is
over
now
.
<EOS>
She
has
learnt
her
hard
,
her
inevitable
lesson
.
<EOS>
The
simple
illusions
of
her
girlhood
are
gone
,
and
my
hand
has
stripped
them
off
.
<EOS>
Better
mine
than
his
 
<EOS>
that
is
all
my
consolation
 
better
mine
than
his
.
  
<EOS>
So
the
first
proposal
is
the
proposal
accepted
.
<EOS>
They
are
to
go
to
Italy
,
and
I
am
to
arrange
,
with
Sir
Percival
's
permission
,
for
meeting
them
and
staying
with
them
when
they
return
to
England
.
<EOS>
In
other
words
,
I
am
to
ask
a
personal
favour
,
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
,
and
to
ask
it
of
the
man
of
all
others
to
whom
I
least
desire
to
owe
a
serious
obligation
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
think
I
could
do
even
more
than
that
,
for
Laura
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
2nd
.
 
<EOS>
On
looking
back
,
I
find
myself
always
referring
to
Sir
Percival
in
disparaging
terms
.
<EOS>
In
the
turn
affairs
have
now
taken
.
<EOS>
I
must
and
will
root
out
my
prejudice
against
him
,
I
can
not
think
how
it
first
got
into
my
mind
.
<EOS>
It
certainly
never
existed
in
former
times
.
  
<EOS>
Is
it
Laura
's
reluctance
to
become
his
wife
that
has
set
me
against
him
?
<EOS>
Have
Hartright
's
perfectly
intelligible
prejudices
infected
me
without
my
suspecting
their
influence
?
<EOS>
Does
that
letter
of
Anne
Catherick
's
still
leave
a
lurking
distrust
in
my
mind
,
in
spite
of
Sir
Percival
's
explanation
,
and
of
the
proof
in
my
possession
of
the
truth
of
it
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
account
for
the
state
of
my
own
feelings
;
the
one
thing
I
am
certain
of
is
,
that
it
is
my
duty
 
<EOS>
doubly
my
duty
now
 
not
to
wrong
Sir
Percival
by
unjustly
distrusting
him
.
<EOS>
If
it
has
got
to
be
a
habit
with
me
always
to
write
of
him
in
the
same
unfavourable
manner
,
I
must
and
will
break
myself
of
this
unworthy
tendency
,
even
though
the
effort
should
force
me
to
close
the
pages
of
my
journal
till
the
marriage
is
over
!
<EOS>
I
am
seriously
dissatisfied
with
myself
 
<EOS>
I
will
write
no
more
to
-
day
.
  
<EOS>
December
16th
.
 
<EOS>
A
whole
fortnight
has
passed
,
and
I
have
not
once
opened
these
pages
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
long
enough
away
from
my
journal
to
come
back
to
it
with
a
healthier
and
better
mind
,
I
hope
,
so
far
as
Sir
Percival
is
concerned
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
not
much
to
record
of
the
past
two
weeks
.
<EOS>
The
dresses
are
almost
all
finished
,
and
the
new
travelling
trunks
have
been
sent
here
from
London
.
<EOS>
Poor
dear
Laura
hardly
leaves
me
for
a
moment
all
day
,
and
<EOS>
last
night
,
when
neither
of
us
could
sleep
,
she
came
and
crept
into
my
bed
to
talk
to
me
there
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
lose
you
so
soon
,
Marian
,
"
she
said
;
"
I
must
make
the
most
of
you
while
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
are
to
be
married
at
Limmeridge
Church
,
and
thank
Heaven
,
not
one
of
the
neighbours
is
to
be
invited
to
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
The
only
visitor
will
be
our
old
friend
,
Mr.
Arnold
,
who
is
to
come
from
Polesdean
to
give
Laura
away
,
her
uncle
being
far
too
delicate
to
trust
himself
outside
the
door
in
such
inclement
weather
as
we
now
have
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
not
determined
,
from
this
day
forth
,
to
see
nothing
but
the
bright
side
of
our
prospects
,
the
melancholy
absence
of
any
male
relative
of
Laura
's
,
at
the
most
important
moment
of
her
life
,
would
make
me
very
gloomy
and
very
distrustful
of
the
future
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
done
with
gloom
and
distrust
 
that
is
to
say
,
I
have
done
with
writing
about
either
the
one
or
the
other
in
this
journal
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
is
to
arrive
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
offered
,
in
case
we
wished
to
treat
him
on
terms
of
rigid
etiquette
,
to
write
and
ask
our
clergyman
to
grant
him
the
hospitality
of
the
rectory
,
during
the
short
period
of
his
sojourn
at
Limmeridge
,
before
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
Under
the
circumstances
,
neither
Mr.
Fairlie
nor
I
thought
it
at
all
necessary
for
us
to
trouble
ourselves
about
attending
to
trifling
forms
and
ceremonies
.
<EOS>
In
our
wild
moorland
country
,
and
in
this
great
lonely
house
,
we
may
well
claim
to
be
beyond
the
reach
of
the
trivial
conventionalities
which
hamper
people
in
other
places
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
to
Sir
Percival
to
thank
him
for
his
polite
offer
,
and
to
beg
that
he
would
occupy
his
old
rooms
,
just
as
usual
,
at
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
17th
.
 
<EOS>
He
arrived
to
-
day
,
looking
,
as
I
thought
,
a
little
worn
and
anxious
,
but
still
talking
and
laughing
like
a
man
in
the
best
possible
spirits
.
<EOS>
He
brought
with
him
some
really
beautiful
presents
in
jewellery
,
which
Laura
received
with
her
best
grace
,
and
,
outwardly
at
least
,
with
perfect
self
-
possession
.
<EOS>
The
only
sign
I
can
detect
of
the
struggle
it
must
cost
her
to
preserve
appearances
at
this
trying
time
,
expresses
itself
in
a
sudden
unwillingness
,
on
her
part
,
ever
to
be
left
alone
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
retreating
to
her
own
room
,
as
usual
,
she
seems
to
dread
going
there
.
<EOS>
When
I
went
upstairs
to
-
day
,
after
lunch
,
to
put
on
my
bonnet
for
a
walk
,
she
volunteered
to
join
me
,
and
again
,
before
dinner
,
she
threw
the
door
open
between
our
two
rooms
,
so
that
we
might
talk
to
each
other
while
we
were
dressing
.
<EOS>
"
Keep
me
always
doing
something
,
"
she
said
;
"
keep
me
always
in
company
with
somebody
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
me
think
 
that
is
all
I
ask
now
,
Marian
 
do
n't
let
me
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
sad
change
in
her
only
increases
her
attractions
for
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
He
interprets
it
,
I
can
see
,
to
his
own
advantage
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
feverish
flush
in
her
cheeks
,
a
feverish
brightness
in
her
eyes
,
which
he
welcomes
as
the
return
of
her
beauty
and
the
recovery
of
her
spirits
.
<EOS>
She
talked
to
-
day
at
dinner
with
a
gaiety
and
carelessness
so
false
,
so
shockingly
out
of
her
character
,
that
I
secretly
longed
to
silence
her
and
take
her
away
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
's
delight
and
surprise
appeared
to
be
beyond
all
expression
.
<EOS>
The
anxiety
which
I
had
noticed
on
his
face
when
he
arrived
totally
disappeared
from
it
,
and
he
looked
,
even
to
my
eyes
,
a
good
ten
years
younger
than
he
really
is
.
  
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
doubt
 
though
some
strange
perversity
prevents
me
from
seeing
it
myself
 
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
Laura
's
future
husband
is
a
very
handsome
man
.
<EOS>
Regular
features
form
a
personal
advantage
to
begin
with
 
and
he
has
them
.
<EOS>
Bright
brown
eyes
,
either
in
man
or
woman
,
are
a
great
attraction
 
<EOS>
and
he
has
them
.
<EOS>
Even
baldness
,
when
it
is
only
baldness
over
the
forehead
(
as
in
his
case
)
,
is
rather
becoming
than
not
in
a
man
,
for
it
heightens
the
head
and
adds
to
the
intelligence
of
the
face
.
<EOS>
Grace
and
ease
of
movement
,
untiring
animation
of
manner
,
ready
,
pliant
,
conversational
powers
 
<EOS>
all
these
are
unquestionable
merits
,
and
all
these
he
certainly
possesses
.
<EOS>
Surely
Mr.
Gilmore
,
ignorant
as
he
is
of
Laura
's
secret
,
was
not
to
blame
for
feeling
surprised
that
she
should
repent
of
her
marriage
engagement
?
<EOS>
Any
one
else
in
his
place
would
have
shared
our
good
old
friend
's
opinion
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
asked
,
at
this
moment
,
to
say
plainly
what
defects
I
have
discovered
in
Sir
Percival
,
I
could
only
point
out
two
.
<EOS>
One
,
his
incessant
restlessness
and
excitability
 
<EOS>
which
may
be
caused
,
naturally
enough
,
by
unusual
energy
of
character
.
<EOS>
The
other
,
his
short
,
sharp
,
ill
-
tempered
manner
of
speaking
to
the
servants
 
which
may
be
only
a
bad
habit
after
all
.
<EOS>
No
,
I
can
not
dispute
it
,
and
I
will
not
dispute
it
 
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
is
a
very
handsome
and
a
very
agreeable
man
.
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
I
have
written
it
down
at
last
,
and
I
am
glad
it
's
over
.
  
<EOS>
18th
.
 
<EOS>
Feeling
weary
and
depressed
this
morning
,
I
left
Laura
with
Mrs.
Vesey
,
and
went
out
alone
for
one
of
my
brisk
midday
walks
,
which
I
have
discontinued
too
much
of
late
.
<EOS>
I
took
the
dry
airy
road
over
the
moor
that
leads
to
Todd
's
Corner
.
<EOS>
After
having
been
out
half
an
hour
,
I
was
excessively
surprised
to
see
Sir
Percival
approaching
me
from
the
direction
of
the
farm
.
<EOS>
He
was
walking
rapidly
,
swinging
his
stick
,
his
head
erect
as
usual
,
and
his
shooting
jacket
flying
open
in
the
wind
.
<EOS>
When
we
met
he
did
not
wait
for
me
to
ask
any
questions
 
he
told
me
at
once
that
he
had
been
to
the
farm
to
inquire
if
Mr.
or
Mrs.
Todd
had
received
any
tidings
,
since
his
last
visit
to
Limmeridge
,
of
Anne
Catherick
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
found
,
of
course
,
that
they
had
heard
nothing
?
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
whatever
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
be
seriously
afraid
that
we
have
lost
her
.
<EOS>
Do
you
happen
to
know
,
"
he
continued
,
looking
me
in
the
face
very
attentively
"
if
the
artist
 
Mr.
Hartright
 
is
in
a
position
to
give
us
any
further
information
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
neither
heard
of
her
,
nor
seen
her
,
since
he
left
Cumberland
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
sad
,
"
said
Sir
Percival
,
speaking
like
a
man
who
was
disappointed
,
and
yet
,
oddly
enough
,
looking
at
the
same
time
like
a
man
who
was
relieved
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
impossible
to
say
what
misfortunes
may
not
have
happened
to
the
miserable
creature
.
<EOS>
I
am
inexpressibly
annoyed
at
the
failure
of
all
my
efforts
to
restore
her
to
the
care
and
protection
which
she
so
urgently
needs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
time
he
really
looked
annoyed
.
<EOS>
I
said
a
few
sympathising
words
,
and
we
then
talked
of
other
subjects
on
our
way
back
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
Surely
my
chance
meeting
with
him
on
the
moor
has
disclosed
another
favourable
trait
in
his
character
?
<EOS>
Surely
it
was
singularly
considerate
and
unselfish
of
him
to
think
of
Anne
Catherick
on
the
eve
of
his
marriage
,
and
to
go
all
the
way
to
Todd
's
Corner
to
make
inquiries
about
her
,
when
he
might
have
passed
the
time
so
much
more
agreeably
in
Laura
's
society
?
<EOS>
Considering
that
he
can
only
have
acted
from
motives
of
pure
charity
,
his
conduct
,
under
the
circumstances
,
shows
unusual
good
feeling
and
deserves
extraordinary
praise
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
give
him
extraordinary
praise
 
<EOS>
and
there
's
an
end
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
19th
.
 
<EOS>
More
discoveries
in
the
inexhaustible
mine
of
Sir
Percival
's
virtues
.
  
<EOS>
To
-
day
I
approached
the
subject
of
my
proposed
sojourn
under
his
wife
's
roof
when
he
brings
her
back
to
England
.
<EOS>
I
had
hardly
dropped
my
first
hint
in
this
direction
before
he
caught
me
warmly
by
the
hand
,
and
said
I
had
made
the
very
offer
to
him
which
he
had
been
,
on
his
side
,
most
anxious
to
make
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
the
companion
of
all
others
whom
he
most
sincerely
longed
to
secure
for
his
wife
,
and
he
begged
me
to
believe
that
I
had
conferred
a
lasting
favour
on
him
by
making
the
proposal
to
live
with
Laura
after
her
marriage
,
exactly
as
I
had
always
lived
with
her
before
it
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
had
thanked
him
in
her
name
and
mine
for
his
considerate
kindness
to
both
of
us
,
we
passed
next
to
the
subject
of
his
wedding
tour
,
and
began
to
talk
of
the
English
society
in
Rome
to
which
Laura
was
to
be
introduced
.
<EOS>
He
ran
over
the
names
of
several
friends
whom
he
expected
to
meet
abroad
this
winter
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
English
,
as
well
as
I
can
remember
,
with
one
exception
.
<EOS>
The
one
exception
was
Count
Fosco
.
  
<EOS>
The
mention
of
the
Count
's
name
,
and
the
discovery
that
he
and
his
wife
are
likely
to
meet
the
bride
and
bridegroom
on
the
continent
,
puts
Laura
's
marriage
,
for
the
first
time
,
in
a
distinctly
favourable
light
.
<EOS>
It
is
likely
to
be
the
means
of
healing
a
family
feud
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
Madame
Fosco
has
chosen
to
forget
her
obligations
as
Laura
's
aunt
out
of
sheer
spite
against
the
late
Mr.
Fairlie
for
his
conduct
in
the
affair
of
the
legacy
.
<EOS>
Now
however
,
she
can
persist
in
this
course
of
conduct
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
and
Count
Fosco
are
old
and
fast
friends
,
and
their
wives
will
have
no
choice
but
to
meet
on
civil
terms
.
<EOS>
Madame
Fosco
in
her
maiden
days
was
one
of
the
most
impertinent
women
I
ever
met
with
 
capricious
,
exacting
,
and
vain
to
the
last
degree
of
absurdity
.
<EOS>
If
her
husband
has
succeeded
in
bringing
her
to
her
senses
,
he
deserves
the
gratitude
of
every
member
of
the
family
,
and
he
may
have
mine
to
begin
with
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
becoming
anxious
to
know
the
Count
.
<EOS>
He
is
the
most
intimate
friend
of
Laura
's
husband
,
and
in
that
capacity
he
excites
my
strongest
interest
.
<EOS>
Neither
Laura
nor
I
have
ever
seen
him
.
<EOS>
All
I
know
of
him
is
that
his
accidental
presence
,
years
ago
,
on
the
steps
of
the
Trinita
del
Monte
at
Rome
,
assisted
Sir
Percival
's
escape
from
robbery
and
assassination
at
the
critical
moment
when
he
was
wounded
in
the
hand
,
and
might
the
next
instant
have
been
wounded
in
the
heart
.
<EOS>
I
remember
also
that
,
at
the
time
of
the
late
Mr.
Fairlie
's
absurd
objections
to
his
sister
's
marriage
,
the
Count
wrote
him
a
very
temperate
and
sensible
letter
on
the
subject
,
which
,
I
am
ashamed
to
say
,
remained
unanswered
.
<EOS>
This
is
all
I
know
of
Sir
Percival
's
friend
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
he
will
ever
come
to
England
?
<EOS>
I
wonder
if
I
shall
like
him
?
  
<EOS>
My
pen
is
running
away
into
mere
speculation
.
<EOS>
Let
me
return
to
sober
matter
of
fact
.
<EOS>
It
is
certain
that
Sir
Percival
's
reception
of
my
venturesome
proposal
to
live
with
his
wife
was
more
than
kind
,
it
was
almost
affectionate
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
Laura
's
husband
will
have
no
reason
to
complain
of
me
if
I
can
only
go
on
as
I
have
begun
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
declared
him
to
be
handsome
,
agreeable
,
full
of
good
feeling
towards
the
unfortunate
and
full
of
affectionate
kindness
towards
me
.
<EOS>
Really
,
I
hardly
know
myself
again
,
in
my
new
character
of
Sir
Percival
's
warmest
friend
.
  
<EOS>
20th
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
Sir
Percival
!
<EOS>
I
flatly
deny
his
good
looks
.
<EOS>
I
consider
him
to
be
eminently
ill
-
tempered
and
disagreeable
,
and
totally
wanting
in
kindness
and
good
feeling
.
<EOS>
Last
night
the
cards
for
the
married
couple
were
sent
home
.
<EOS>
Laura
opened
the
packet
and
saw
her
future
name
in
print
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
looked
over
her
shoulder
familiarly
at
the
new
card
which
had
already
transformed
Miss
Fairlie
into
Lady
Glyde
 
smiled
with
the
most
odious
self
-
complacency
,
and
whispered
something
in
her
ear
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
it
was
 
<EOS>
Laura
has
refused
to
tell
me
 
<EOS>
but
I
saw
her
face
turn
to
such
a
deadly
whiteness
that
I
thought
she
would
have
fainted
.
<EOS>
He
took
no
notice
of
the
change
 
he
seemed
to
be
barbarously
unconscious
that
he
had
said
anything
to
pain
her
.
<EOS>
All
my
old
feelings
of
hostility
towards
him
revived
on
the
instant
,
and
all
the
hours
that
have
passed
since
have
done
nothing
to
dissipate
them
.
<EOS>
I
am
more
unreasonable
and
more
unjust
than
ever
.
<EOS>
In
three
words
 
how
glibly
my
pen
writes
them
!
 
<EOS>
in
three
words
,
I
hate
him
.
  
<EOS>
21st
.
 
<EOS>
Have
the
anxieties
of
this
anxious
time
shaken
me
a
little
,
at
last
?
<EOS>
I
have
been
writing
,
for
the
last
few
days
,
in
a
tone
of
levity
which
,
Heaven
knows
,
is
far
enough
from
my
heart
,
and
which
it
has
rather
shocked
me
to
discover
on
looking
back
at
the
entries
in
my
journal
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
may
have
caught
the
feverish
excitement
of
Laura
's
spirits
for
the
last
week
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
the
fit
has
already
passed
away
from
me
,
and
has
left
me
in
a
very
strange
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
A
persistent
idea
has
been
forcing
itself
on
my
attention
,
ever
since
last
night
,
that
something
will
yet
happen
to
prevent
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
What
has
produced
this
singular
fancy
?
<EOS>
Is
it
the
indirect
result
of
my
apprehensions
for
Laura
's
future
?
<EOS>
Or
has
it
been
unconsciously
suggested
to
me
by
the
increasing
restlessness
and
irritability
which
I
have
certainly
observed
in
Sir
Percival
's
manner
as
the
wedding
-
day
draws
nearer
and
nearer
?
<EOS>
Impossible
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
have
the
idea
 
surely
the
wildest
idea
,
<EOS>
under
the
circumstances
,
that
ever
entered
a
woman
's
head
?
 
<EOS>
but
try
as
I
may
,
I
can
not
trace
it
back
to
its
source
.
  
<EOS>
This
last
day
has
been
all
confusion
and
wretchedness
.
<EOS>
How
can
I
write
about
it
?
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
I
must
write
.
<EOS>
Anything
is
better
than
brooding
over
my
own
gloomy
thoughts
.
  
<EOS>
Kind
Mrs.
Vesey
,
whom
we
have
all
too
much
overlooked
and
forgotten
of
late
,
innocently
caused
us
a
sad
morning
to
begin
with
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
,
for
months
past
,
secretly
making
a
warm
Shetland
shawl
for
her
dear
pupil
 
a
most
beautiful
and
surprising
piece
of
work
to
be
done
by
a
woman
at
her
age
and
with
her
habits
.
<EOS>
The
gift
was
presented
this
morning
,
and
poor
warm
-
hearted
Laura
completely
broke
down
when
the
shawl
was
put
proudly
on
her
shoulders
by
the
loving
old
friend
and
guardian
of
her
motherless
childhood
.
<EOS>
I
was
hardly
allowed
time
to
quiet
them
both
,
or
even
to
dry
my
own
eyes
,
when
I
was
sent
for
by
Mr.
Fairlie
,
to
be
favoured
with
a
long
recital
of
his
arrangements
for
the
preservation
of
his
own
tranquillity
on
the
wedding
-
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Laura
"
was
to
receive
his
present
 
<EOS>
a
shabby
ring
,
with
her
affectionate
uncle
's
hair
for
an
ornament
,
instead
of
a
precious
stone
,
and
with
a
heartless
French
inscription
inside
,
about
congenial
sentiments
and
eternal
friendship
 
<EOS>
"
dear
Laura
"
was
to
receive
this
tender
tribute
from
my
hands
immediately
,
so
that
she
might
have
plenty
of
time
to
recover
from
the
agitation
produced
by
the
gift
before
she
appeared
in
Mr.
Fairlie
's
presence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
Laura
"
was
to
pay
him
a
little
visit
that
evening
,
and
to
be
kind
enough
not
to
make
a
scene
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
Laura
"
was
to
pay
him
another
little
visit
in
her
wedding
-
dress
the
next
morning
,
and
to
be
kind
enough
,
again
,
not
to
make
a
scene
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
Laura
"
was
to
look
in
once
more
,
for
the
third
time
,
before
going
away
,
but
without
harrowing
his
feelings
by
saying
WHEN
she
was
going
away
,
and
without
tears
 
"
in
the
name
of
pity
,
in
the
name
of
everything
,
dear
Marian
,
that
is
most
affectionate
and
most
domestic
,
and
most
delightfully
and
charmingly
self
-
composed
,
WITHOUT
TEARS
!
<EOS>
"
I
was
so
exasperated
by
this
miserable
selfish
trifling
,
at
such
a
time
,
that
I
should
certainly
have
shocked
Mr.
Fairlie
by
some
of
the
hardest
and
rudest
truths
he
has
ever
heard
in
his
life
,
if
the
arrival
of
Mr.
Arnold
from
Polesdean
had
not
called
me
away
to
new
duties
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
day
is
indescribable
.
<EOS>
I
believe
no
one
in
the
house
really
knew
how
it
passed
.
<EOS>
The
confusion
of
small
events
,
all
huddled
together
one
on
the
other
,
bewildered
everybody
.
<EOS>
There
were
dresses
sent
home
that
had
been
forgotten
 
there
were
trunks
to
be
packed
and
unpacked
and
packed
again
 
there
were
presents
from
friends
far
and
near
,
friends
high
and
low
.
<EOS>
We
were
all
needlessly
hurried
,
all
nervously
expectant
of
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
,
especially
,
was
too
restless
now
to
remain
five
minutes
together
in
the
same
place
.
<EOS>
That
short
,
sharp
cough
of
his
troubled
him
more
than
ever
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
and
out
of
doors
all
day
long
,
and
he
seemed
to
grow
so
inquisitive
on
a
sudden
,
that
he
questioned
the
very
strangers
who
came
on
small
errands
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
Add
to
all
this
,
the
one
perpetual
thought
in
Laura
's
mind
and
mine
,
that
we
were
to
part
the
next
day
,
and
the
haunting
dread
,
unexpressed
by
either
of
us
,
and
yet
ever
present
to
both
,
that
this
deplorable
marriage
might
prove
to
be
the
one
fatal
error
of
her
life
and
the
one
hopeless
sorrow
of
mine
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
in
all
the
years
of
our
close
and
happy
intercourse
we
almost
avoided
looking
each
other
in
the
face
,
and
we
refrained
,
by
common
consent
,
from
speaking
together
in
private
through
the
whole
evening
.
<EOS>
I
can
dwell
on
it
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Whatever
future
sorrows
may
be
in
store
for
me
,
I
shall
always
look
back
on
this
twenty
-
first
of
December
as
the
most
comfortless
and
most
miserable
day
of
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
writing
these
lines
in
the
solitude
of
my
own
room
,
long
after
midnight
,
having
just
come
back
from
a
stolen
look
at
Laura
in
her
pretty
little
white
bed
 
<EOS>
the
bed
she
has
occupied
since
the
days
of
her
girlhood
.
  
<EOS>
There
she
lay
,
unconscious
that
I
was
looking
at
her
 
quiet
,
more
quiet
than
I
had
dared
to
hope
,
but
not
sleeping
.
<EOS>
The
glimmer
of
the
night
-
light
showed
me
that
her
eyes
were
only
partially
closed
 
the
traces
of
tears
glistened
between
her
eyelids
.
<EOS>
My
little
keepsake
 
only
a
brooch
 
lay
on
the
table
at
her
bedside
,
with
her
prayer
-
book
,
and
the
miniature
portrait
of
her
father
which
she
takes
with
her
wherever
she
goes
.
<EOS>
I
waited
a
moment
,
looking
at
her
from
behind
her
pillow
,
as
she
lay
beneath
me
,
with
one
arm
and
hand
resting
on
the
white
coverlid
,
so
still
,
so
quietly
breathing
,
that
the
frill
on
her
night
-
dress
never
moved
 
<EOS>
I
waited
,
looking
at
her
,
as
I
have
seen
her
thousands
of
times
,
as
I
shall
never
see
her
again
 
and
then
stole
back
to
my
room
.
<EOS>
My
own
love
!
<EOS>
with
all
your
wealth
,
and
all
your
beauty
,
how
friendless
you
are
!
<EOS>
The
one
man
who
would
give
his
heart
's
life
to
serve
you
is
far
away
,
tossing
,
this
stormy
night
,
on
the
awful
sea
.
<EOS>
Who
else
is
left
to
you
?
<EOS>
No
father
,
no
brother
 
no
living
creature
but
the
helpless
,
useless
woman
who
writes
these
sad
lines
,
and
watches
by
you
for
the
morning
,
in
sorrow
that
she
can
not
compose
,
in
doubt
that
she
can
not
conquer
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
a
trust
is
to
be
placed
in
that
man
's
hands
to
-
morrow
!
<EOS>
If
ever
he
forgets
it
 
if
ever
he
injures
a
hair
of
her
head
!

SECOND
OF

Seven
o'clock

<EOS>
A
wild
,
unsettled
morning

<EOS>
She
has
just
risen
 
better
and
calmer

now
that
the
time
has
come
,
than
she
was
yesterday

<EOS>
Ten
o'clock

<EOS>
She
is
dressed

<EOS>
We
have
kissed
each

we
have
promised
each
other
not
to
lose
courage
.
<EOS>
I
am
away
for
a
moment
in
my
own
room
.
<EOS>
In
the
whirl
and
confusion
of
my
thoughts
,
I
can
detect
that
strange
fancy
of
some
hindrance
happening
to
stop
the
marriage
still
hanging
about
my
mind
.
<EOS>
Is
it
hanging
about
HIS
mind
too
?
<EOS>
I
see
him
from
the
window
,
moving
hither
and
thither
uneasily
among
the
carriages
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
How
can
I
write
such
folly
!
<EOS>
The
marriage
is
a
certainty
.
<EOS>
In
less
than
half
an
hour
we
start
for
the
church

Eleven
o'clock

It
is
all
over

They
are

Three
o'clock

They
are
gone

am
blind
with
crying

Six
months
to
look
back
on
 
six
long
,
lonely
months
since
Laura
and
I
last
saw
each
other
!
  
<EOS>
How
many
days
have
I
still
to
wait
?
<EOS>
Only
one
!
<EOS>
To

morrow
,
the
twelfth
,
the
travellers
return
to
England
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
realise
my
own
happiness
 
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
believe
that
the
next
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
will
complete
the
last
day
of
separation
between
Laura
and
me
.
  
<EOS>
She
and
her
husband
have
been
in
Italy
all
the
winter
,
and
afterwards
in
the
Tyrol
.
<EOS>
They
come
back
,
accompanied
by
Count
Fosco
and
his
wife
,
who
propose
to
settle
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
of
London
,
and
who
have
engaged
to
stay
at
Blackwater
Park
for
the
summer
months
before
deciding
on
a
place
of
residence
.
<EOS>
So
long
as
Laura
returns
,
no
matter
who
returns
with
her
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
may
fill
the

from

likes

on
condition
that
his

and
I
inhabit
it
together

Meanwhile

here
I
am

established

by
her
side
,
and
all
her
earthly
possessions
ranged
round
her
in
three
boxes
and
a
bag
.
  
<EOS>
I
left
Limmeridge
yesterday
,
having
received
Laura
's
delightful
letter
from
Paris
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
previously
uncertain
whether
I
was
to
meet
them
in
London
or
in
Hampshire
,
but
this
last
letter
informed
me
that
Sir
Percival
proposed
to
land
at
Southampton
,
and
to
travel
straight
on
to
his
country
-
house
.
<EOS>
He
has
spent
so
much
money
abroad
that
he
has
none
left
to
defray
the
expenses
of
living
in
London
for
the
remainder
of
the
season
,
and
he
is
economically
resolved
to
pass
the
summer
and
autumn
quietly
at
Blackwater
.
<EOS>
Laura
has
had
more
than
enough
of
excitement
and
change
of
scene
,
and
is
pleased
at
the
prospect
of
country
tranquillity
and
retirement
which
her
husband
's
prudence
provides
for
her
.
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
I
am
ready
to
be
happy
anywhere
in
her
society
.
<EOS>
We
are
all
,
therefore
,
well
contented
in
our
various
ways
,
to
begin
with
.
  
<EOS>
Last
night
I
slept
in
London
,
and
was
delayed
there
so
long
to
-
day
by
various
calls
and
commissions
,
that
I
did
not
reach
Blackwater
this
evening
till
after
dusk
.
  
<EOS>
Judging
by
my
vague
impressions
of
the
place
thus
far
,
it
is
the
exact
opposite
of
Limmeridge
.
  
<EOS>
The
house
is
situated
on
a
dead
flat
,
and
seems
to
be
shut
in
 
almost
suffocated
,
to
my
north
-
country
notions
,
by
trees
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
nobody
but
the
man
-
servant
who
opened
the
door
to
me
,
and
the
housekeeper
,
a
very
civil
person
,
who
showed
me
the
way
to
my
own
room
,
and
got
me
my
tea
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
nice
little
boudoir
and
bedroom
,
at
the
end
of
a
long
passage
on
the
first
floor
.
<EOS>
The
servants
and
some
of
the
spare
rooms
are
on
the
second
floor
,
and
all
the
living
rooms
are
on
the
ground
floor
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
one
of
them
yet
,
and
I
know
nothing
about
the
house
,
except
that
one
wing
of
it
is
said
to
be
five
hundred
years
old
,
that
it
had
a
moat
round
it
once
,
and
that
it
gets
its
name
of
Blackwater
from
a
lake
in
the
park
.
  
<EOS>
Eleven
o'clock
has
just
struck
,
in
a
ghostly
and
solemn
manner
,
from
a
turret
over
the
centre
of
the
house
,
which
I
saw
when
I
came
in
.
<EOS>
A
large
dog
has
been
woke
,
apparently
by
the
sound
of
the
bell
,
and
is
howling
and
yawning
drearily
,
somewhere
round
a
corner
.
<EOS>
I
hear
echoing
footsteps
in
the
passages
below
,
and
the
iron
thumping
of
bolts
and
bars
at
the
house
door
.
<EOS>
The
servants
are
evidently
going
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
follow
their
example
?
  
<EOS>
No
,
I
am
not
half
sleepy
enough
.
<EOS>
Sleepy
,
did
I
say
?
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
I
should
never
close
my
eyes
again
.
<EOS>
The
bare
anticipation
of
seeing
that
dear
face
,
and
hearing
that
well
-
known
voice
to
-
morrow
,
keeps
me
in
a
perpetual
fever
of
excitement
.
<EOS>
If
I
only
had
the
privileges
of
a
man
,
I
would
order
out
Sir
Percival
's
best
horse
instantly
,
and
tear
away
on
a
night
-
gallop
,
eastward
,
to
meet
the
rising
sun
 
a
long
,
hard
,
heavy
,
ceaseless
gallop
of
hours
and
hours
,
like
the
famous
highwayman
's
ride
to
York
.
<EOS>
Being
,
however
,
nothing
but
a
woman
,
condemned
to
patience
,
propriety
,
and
petticoats
for
life
,
I
must
respect
the
house
-
keeper
's
opinions
,
and
try
to
compose
myself
in
some
feeble
and
feminine
way
.
  
<EOS>
Reading
is
out
of
the
question
 
I
ca
n't
fix
my
attention
on
books
.
<EOS>
Let
me
try
if
I
can
write
myself
into
sleepiness
and
fatigue
.
<EOS>
My
journal
has
been
very
much
neglected
of
late
.
<EOS>
What
can
I
recall
 
standing
,
as
I
now
do
,
on
the
threshold
of
a
new
life
 
of
persons
and
events
,
of
chances
and
changes
,
during
the
past
six
months
 
the
long
,
weary
,
empty
interval
since
Laura
's
wedding
-
day
?
  
<EOS>
Walter
Hartright
is
uppermost
in
my
memory
,
and
he
passes
first
in
the
shadowy
procession
of
my
absent
friends
.
<EOS>
I
received
a
few
lines
from
him
,
after
the
landing
of
the
expedition
in
Honduras
,
written
more
cheerfully
and
hopefully
than
he
has
written
yet
.
<EOS>
A
month
or
six
weeks
later
I
saw
an
extract
from
an
American
newspaper
,
describing
the
departure
of
the
adventurers
on
their
inland
journey
.
<EOS>
They
were
last
seen
entering
a
wild
primeval
forest
,
each
man
with
his
rifle
on
his
shoulder
and
his
baggage
at
his
back
.
<EOS>
Since
that
time
,
civilisation
has
lost
all
trace
of
them
.
<EOS>
Not
a
line
more
have
I
received
from
Walter
,
not
a
fragment
of
news
from
the
expedition
has
appeared
in
any
of
the
public
journals
.
  
<EOS>
The
same
dense
,
disheartening
obscurity
hangs
over
the
fate
and
fortunes
of
Anne
Catherick
,
and
her
companion
,
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
Nothing
whatever
has
been
heard
of
either
of
them
.
<EOS>
Whether
they
are
in
the
country
or
out
of
it
,
whether
they
are
living
or
dead
,
no
one
knows
.
<EOS>
Even
Sir
Percival
's
solicitor
has
lost
all
hope
,
and
has
ordered
the
useless
search
after
the
fugitives
to
be
finally
given
up
.
  
<EOS>
Our
good
old
friend
Mr.
Gilmore
has
met
with
a
sad
check
in
his
active
professional
career
.
<EOS>
Early
in
the
spring
we
were
alarmed
by
hearing
that
he
had
been
found
insensible
at
his
desk
,
and
that
the
seizure
was
pronounced
to
be
an
apoplectic
fit
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
long
complaining
of
fulness
and
oppression
in
the
head
,
and
his
doctor
had
warned
him
of
the
consequences
that
would
follow
his
persistency
in
continuing
to
work
,
early
and
late
,
as
if
he
were
still
a
young
man
.
<EOS>
The
result
now
is
that
he
has
been
positively
ordered
to
keep
out
of
his
office
for
a
year
to
come
,
at
least
,
and
to
seek
repose
of
body
and
relief
of
mind
by
altogether
changing
his
usual
mode
of
life
.
<EOS>
The
business
is
left
,
accordingly
,
to
be
carried
on
by
his
partner
,
and
he
is
himself
,
at
this
moment
,
away
in
Germany
,
visiting
some
relations
who
are
settled
there
in
mercantile
pursuits
.
<EOS>
Thus
another
true
friend
and
trustworthy
adviser
is
lost
to
us
 
<EOS>
lost
,
I
earnestly
hope
and
trust
,
for
a
time
only
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Vesey
travelled
with
me
as
far
as
London
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
abandon
her
to
solitude
at
Limmeridge
after
Laura
<EOS>
and
I
had
both
left
the
house
,
and
we
have
arranged
that
she
is
to
live
with
an
unmarried
younger
sister
of
hers
,
who
keeps
a
school
at
Clapham
.
<EOS>
She
is
to
come
here
this
autumn
to
visit
her
pupil
 
<EOS>
I
might
almost
say
her
adopted
child
.
<EOS>
I
saw
the
good
old
lady
safe
to
her
destination
,
and
left
her
in
the
care
of
her
relative
,
quietly
happy
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
Laura
again
in
a
few
months
'
time
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
Mr.
Fairlie
,
I
believe
I
am
guilty
of
no
injustice
if
I
describe
him
as
being
unutterably
relieved
by
having
the
house
clear
of
us
women
.
<EOS>
The
idea
of
his
missing
his
niece
is
simply
preposterous
 
<EOS>
he
used
to
let
months
pass
in
the
old
times
without
attempting
to
see
her
 
and
in
my
case
and
Mrs.
Vesey
's
,
I
take
leave
to
consider
his
telling
us
both
that
he
was
half
heart
-
broken
at
our
departure
,
to
be
equivalent
to
a
confession
that
he
was
secretly
rejoiced
to
get
rid
of
us
.
<EOS>
His
last
caprice
has
led
him
to
keep
two
photographers
incessantly
employed
in
producing
sun
-
pictures
of
all
the
treasures
and
curiosities
in
his
possession
.
<EOS>
One
complete
copy
of
the
collection
of
the
photographs
is
to
be
presented
to
the
Mechanics
'
Institution
of
Carlisle
,
mounted
on
the
finest
cardboard
,
with
ostentatious
red
-
letter
inscriptions
underneath
,

<EOS>
Valued
at
three
hundred
guineas
.
<EOS>
In
the
possession
of
Frederick
Fairlie
,
Esq
.
<EOS>
"
Dozens
of
photographs
of
this
sort
,
and
all
inscribed
in
this
manner
,
were
completed
before
I
left
Cumberland
,
and
hundreds
more
remain
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
With
this
new
interest
to
occupy
him
,
Mr.
Fairlie
will
be
a
happy
man
for
months
and
months
to
come
,
and
the
two
unfortunate
photographers
will
share
the
social
martyrdom
which
he
has
hitherto
inflicted
on
his
valet
alone
.
  
<EOS>
So
much
for
the
persons
and
events
which
hold
the
foremost
place
in
my
memory
.
<EOS>
What
next
of
the
one
person
who
holds
the
foremost
place
in
my
heart
?
<EOS>
Laura
has
been
present
to
my
thoughts
all
the
while
I
have
been
writing
these
lines
.
<EOS>
What
can
I
recall
of
her
during
the
past
six
months
,
before
I
close
my
journal
for
the
night
?
  
<EOS>
I
have
only
her
letters
to
guide
me
,
and
on
the
most
important
of
all
the
questions
which
our
correspondence
can
discuss
,
every
one
of
those
letters
leaves
me
in
the
dark
.
  
<EOS>
Does
he
treat
her
kindly
?
<EOS>
Is
she
happier
now
than
she
was
when
I
parted
with
her
on
the
wedding
-
day
?
<EOS>
All
my
letters
have
contained
these
two
inquiries
,
put
more
or
less
directly
,
now
in
one
form
,
and
now
in
another
,
and
all
,
on
that
point
only
,
have
remained
without
reply
,
or
have
been
answered
as
if
my
questions
merely
related
to
the
state
of
her
health
.
<EOS>
She
informs
me
,
over
and
over
again
,
that
she
is
perfectly
well
 
that
travelling
agrees
with
her
 
that
she
is
getting
through
the
winter
,
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
,
without
catching
cold
 
but
not
a
word
<EOS>
can
I
find
anywhere
which
tells
me
plainly
that
she
is
reconciled
to
her
marriage
,
and
that
she
can
now
look
back
to
the
twenty
-
second
of
December
without
any
bitter
feelings
of
repentance
and
regret
.
<EOS>
The
name
of
her
husband
is
only
mentioned
in
her
letters
,
as
she
might
mention
the
name
of
a
friend
who
was
travelling
with
them
,
and
who
had
undertaken
to
make
all
the
arrangements
for
the
journey
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
"
has
settled
that
we
leave
on
such
a
day
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Percival
"
has
decided
that
we
travel
by
such
a
road
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
she
writes
"
Percival
"
only
,
but
very
seldom
 
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
she
gives
him
his
title
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
find
that
his
habits
and
opinions
have
changed
and
coloured
hers
in
any
single
particular
.
<EOS>
The
usual
moral
transformation
which
is
insensibly
wrought
in
a
young
,
fresh
,
sensitive
woman
by
her
marriage
,
seems
never
to
have
taken
place
in
Laura
.
<EOS>
She
writes
of
her
own
thoughts
and
impressions
,
amid
all
the
wonders
she
has
seen
,
exactly
as
she
might
have
written
to
some
one
else
,
if
I
had
been
travelling
with
her
instead
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
I
see
no
betrayal
anywhere
of
sympathy
of
any
kind
existing
between
them
.
<EOS>
Even
when
she
wanders
from
the
subject
of
her
travels
,
and
occupies
herself
with
the
prospects
that
await
her
in
England
,
her
speculations
are
busied
with
her
future
as
my
sister
,
and
persistently
neglect
to
notice
her
future
as
Sir
Percival
's
wife
.
<EOS>
In
all
this
there
is
no
undertone
of
complaint
to
warn
me
that
she
is
absolutely
unhappy
in
her
married
life
.
<EOS>
The
impression
I
have
derived
from
our
correspondence
does
not
,
thank
God
,
lead
me
to
any
such
distressing
conclusion
as
that
.
<EOS>
I
only
see
a
sad
torpor
,
an
unchangeable
indifference
,
when
I
turn
my
mind
from
her
in
the
old
character
of
a
sister
,
and
look
at
her
,
through
the
medium
of
her
letters
,
in
the
new
character
of
a
wife
.
<EOS>
In
other
words
,
it
is
always
Laura
Fairlie
who
has
been
writing
to
me
for
the
last
six
months
,
and
never
Lady
Glyde
.
  
<EOS>
The
strange
silence
which
she
maintains
on
the
subject
of
her
husband
's
character
and
conduct
<EOS>
,
she
preserves
with
almost
equal
resolution
in
the
few
references
which
her
later
letters
contain
to
the
name
of
her
husband
's
bosom
friend
,
Count
Fosco
.
  
<EOS>
For
some
unexplained
reason
the
Count
and
his
wife
appear
to
have
changed
their
plans
abruptly
,
at
the
end
of
last
autumn
,
and
to
have
gone
to
Vienna
instead
of
going
to
Rome
,
<EOS>
at
which
latter
place
Sir
Percival
had
expected
to
find
them
when
he
left
England
.
<EOS>
They
only
quitted
Vienna
in
the
spring
,
and
travelled
as
far
as
the
Tyrol
to
meet
the
bride
and
bridegroom
on
their
homeward
journey
.
<EOS>
Laura
writes
readily
enough
about
the
meeting
with
Madame
Fosco
,
and
assures
me
that
she
has
found
her
aunt
so
much
changed
for
the
better
 
so
much
quieter
,
and
so
much
more
sensible
as
a
wife
than
she
was
as
a
single
woman
 
that
I
shall
hardly
know
her
again
when
I
see
her
here
.
<EOS>
But
on
the
subject
of
Count
Fosco
(
who
interests
me
infinitely
more
than
his
wife
)
,
Laura
is
provokingly
circumspect
and
silent
.
<EOS>
She
only
says
that
he
puzzles
her
,
and
that
she
will
not
tell
me
what
her
impression
of
him
is
until
I
have
seen
him
,
and
formed
my
own
opinion
first
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
to
my
mind
,
looks
ill
for
the
Count
.
<EOS>
Laura
has
preserved
,
far
more
perfectly
than
most
people
do
in
later
life
,
the
child
's
subtle
faculty
of
knowing
a
friend
by
instinct
,
and
if
I
am
right
in
assuming
that
her
first
impression
of
Count
Fosco
has
not
been
favourable
,
I
for
one
am
in
some
danger
of
doubting
and
distrusting
that
illustrious
foreigner
before
I
have
so
much
as
set
eyes
on
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
patience
,
patience
 
this
uncertainty
,
and
many
uncertainties
more
,
can
not
last
much
longer
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
will
see
all
my
doubts
in
a
fair
way
of
being
cleared
up
,
sooner
or
later
.
  
<EOS>
Twelve
o'clock
has
struck
,
and
I
have
just
come
back
to
close
these
pages
,
after
looking
out
at
my
open
window
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
a
still
,
sultry
,
moonless
night
.
<EOS>
The
stars
are
dull
and
few
.
<EOS>
The
trees
that
shut
out
the
view
on
all
sides
look
dimly
black
and
solid
in
the
distance
,
like
a
great
wall
of
rock
.
<EOS>
I
hear
the
croaking
of
frogs
,
faint
and
far
off
,
and
the
echoes
of
the
great
clock
hum
in
the
airless
calm
long
after
the
strokes
have
ceased
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
Blackwater
Park
will
look
in
the
daytime
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
altogether
like
it
by
night
.
  
<EOS>
12th
.
 
<EOS>
A
day
of
investigations
and
discoveries
 
a
more
interesting
day
,
for
many
reasons
,
than
I
had
ventured
to
anticipate
.
  
<EOS>
I
began
my
sight
-
seeing
,
of
course
,
with
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
The
main
body
of
the
building
is
of
the
time
of
that
highly
-
overrated
woman
,
Queen
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
On
the
ground
floor
there
are
two
hugely
long
galleries
,
with
low
ceilings
lying
parallel
with
each
other
,
and
rendered
additionally
dark
and
dismal
by
hideous
family
portraits
 
<EOS>
every
one
of
which
I
should
like
to
burn
.
<EOS>
The
rooms
on
the
floor
above
the
two
galleries
are
kept
in
tolerable
repair
,
but
are
very
seldom
used
.
<EOS>
The
civil
housekeeper
,
who
acted
as
my
guide
,
offered
to
show
me
over
them
,
but
considerately
added
that
she
feared
I
should
find
them
rather
out
of
order
.
<EOS>
My
respect
for
the
integrity
of
my
own
petticoats
and
stockings
infinitely
exceeds
my
respect
for
all
the
Elizabethan
bedrooms
in
the
kingdom
,
so
I
positively
declined
exploring
the
upper
regions
of
dust
and
dirt
at
the
risk
of
soiling
my
nice
clean
clothes
.
<EOS>
The
housekeeper
said
,
"
I
am
quite
of
your
opinion
,
miss
,
"
and
appeared
to
think
me
the
most
sensible
woman
she
had
met
with
for
a
long
time
past
.
  
<EOS>
So
much
,
then
,
for
the
main
building
.
<EOS>
Two
wings
are
added
at
either
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
half
-
ruined
wing
on
the
left
(
as
you
approach
the
house
)
was
once
a
place
of
residence
standing
by
itself
,
and
was
built
in
the
fourteenth
century
.
<EOS>
One
of
Sir
Percival
's
maternal
ancestors
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
remember
,
and
do
n't
care
which
 
tacked
on
the
main
building
,
at
right
angles
to
it
,
in
the
aforesaid
Queen
Elizabeth
's
time
.
<EOS>
The
housekeeper
told
me
that
the
architecture
of
"
the
old
wing
,
"
both
outside
and
inside
,
was
considered
remarkably
fine
by
good
judges
.
<EOS>
On
further
investigation
I
discovered
that
good
judges
could
only
exercise
their
abilities
on
Sir
Percival
's
piece
of
antiquity
by
previously
dismissing
from
their
minds
all
fear
of
damp
,
darkness
,
and
rats
.
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
,
I
unhesitatingly
acknowledged
myself
to
be
no
judge
at
all
,
and
suggested
that
we
should
treat
"
the
old
wing
"
precisely
as
we
had
previously
treated
the
Elizabethan
bedrooms
.
<EOS>
Once
more
the
housekeeper
said
,
"
I
am
quite
of
your
opinion
,
miss
,
"
and
once
more
she
looked
at
me
with
undisguised
admiration
of
my
extraordinary
common
-
sense
.
  
<EOS>
We
went
next
to
the
wing
on
the
right
,
which
was
built
,
by
way
of
completing
the
wonderful
architectural
jumble
at
Blackwater
Park
,
in
the
time
of
George
the
Second
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
the
habitable
part
of
the
house
,
which
has
been
repaired
and
redecorated
inside
on
Laura
's
account
.
<EOS>
My
two
rooms
,
and
all
the
good
bedrooms
besides
,
are
on
the
first
floor
,
and
the
basement
contains
a
drawing
-
room
,
a
dining
-
room
,
a
morning
-
room
,
a
library
,
and
a
pretty
little
boudoir
for
Laura
,
all
very
nicely
ornamented
in
the
bright
modern
way
,
and
all
very
elegantly
furnished
with
the
delightful
modern
luxuries
.
<EOS>
None
of
the
rooms
are
anything
like
so
large
and
airy
as
our
rooms
at
Limmeridge
,
but
they
all
look
pleasant
to
live
in
.
<EOS>
I
was
terribly
afraid
,
from
what
I
had
heard
of
Blackwater
Park
,
of
fatiguing
antique
chairs
,
and
dismal
stained
glass
,
and
musty
,
frouzy
hangings
,
and
all
the
barbarous
lumber
which
people
born
without
a
sense
of
comfort
accumulate
about
them
,
in
defiance
of
the
consideration
due
to
the
convenience
of
their
friends
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
inexpressible
relief
to
find
that
the
nineteenth
century
has
invaded
this
strange
future
home
of
mine
,
and
has
swept
the
dirty
"
good
old
times
"
out
of
the
way
of
our
daily
life
.
  
<EOS>
I
dawdled
away
the
morning
 
part
of
the
time
in
the
rooms
downstairs
,
and
part
out
of
doors
in
the
great
square
which
is
formed
by
the
three
sides
of
the
house
,
and
by
the
lofty
iron
railings
and
gates
which
protect
it
in
front
.
<EOS>
A
large
circular
fish
-
pond
with
stone
sides
,
and
an
allegorical
leaden
monster
in
the
middle
,
occupies
the
centre
of
the
square
.
<EOS>
The
pond
itself
is
full
of
gold
and
silver
fish
,
and
is
encircled
by
a
broad
belt
of
the
softest
turf
I
ever
walked
on
.
<EOS>
I
loitered
here
on
the
shady
side
pleasantly
enough
till
luncheon
-
time
,
and
after
that
took
my
broad
straw
hat
and
wandered
out
alone
in
the
warm
lovely
sunlight
to
explore
the
grounds
.
  
<EOS>
Daylight
confirmed
the
impression
which
I
had
felt
the
night
before
,
of
there
being
too
many
trees
at
Blackwater
.
<EOS>
The
house
is
stifled
by
them
.
<EOS>
They
are
,
for
the
most
part
,
young
,
and
planted
far
too
thickly
.
<EOS>
I
suspect
there
must
have
been
a
ruinous
cutting
down
of
timber
all
over
the
estate
before
Sir
Percival
's
time
,
and
an
angry
anxiety
on
the
part
of
the
next
possessor
to
fill
up
all
the
gaps
as
thickly
and
rapidly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
After
looking
about
me
in
front
of
the
house
,
I
observed
a
flower
-
garden
on
my
left
hand
,
and
walked
towards
it
to
see
what
I
could
discover
in
that
direction
.
  
<EOS>
On
a
nearer
view
the
garden
proved
to
be
small
and
poor
and
ill
kept
.
<EOS>
I
left
it
behind
me
,
opened
a
little
gate
in
a
ring
fence
,
and
found
myself
in
a
plantation
of
fir
-
trees
.
  
<EOS>
A
pretty
winding
path
,
artificially
made
,
led
me
on
among
the
trees
,
and
my
north
-
country
experience
soon
informed
me
that
I
was
approaching
sandy
,
heathy
ground
.
<EOS>
After
a
walk
of
more
than
half
a
mile
,
I
should
think
,
among
the
firs
,
the
path
took
a
sharp
turn
 
the
trees
abruptly
ceased
to
appear
on
either
side
of
me
,
and
I
found
myself
standing
suddenly
on
the
margin
of
a
vast
open
space
,
and
looking
down
at
the
Blackwater
lake
from
which
the
house
takes
its
name
.
  
<EOS>
The
ground
,
shelving
away
below
me
,
was
all
sand
,
with
a
few
little
heathy
hillocks
to
break
the
monotony
of
it
in
certain
places
.
<EOS>
The
lake
itself
had
evidently
once
flowed
to
the
spot
on
which
I
stood
,
and
had
been
gradually
wasted
and
dried
up
to
less
than
a
third
of
its
former
size
.
<EOS>
I
saw
its
still
,
stagnant
waters
,
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
from
me
in
the
hollow
,
separated
into
pools
and
ponds
by
twining
reeds
and
rushes
,
and
little
knolls
of
earth
.
<EOS>
On
the
farther
bank
from
me
the
trees
rose
thickly
again
,
and
shut
out
the
view
,
and
cast
their
black
shadows
on
the
sluggish
,
shallow
water
.
<EOS>
As
I
walked
down
to
the
lake
,
I
saw
that
the
ground
on
its
farther
side
was
damp
and
marshy
,
overgrown
with
rank
grass
and
dismal
willows
.
<EOS>
The
water
,
which
was
clear
enough
on
the
open
sandy
side
,
where
the
sun
shone
,
looked
black
and
poisonous
opposite
to
me
,
where
it
lay
deeper
under
the
shade
of
the
spongy
banks
,
and
the
rank
overhanging
thickets
and
tangled
trees
.
<EOS>
The
frogs
were
croaking
,
and
the
rats
were
slipping
in
and
out
of
the
shadowy
water
,
like
live
shadows
themselves
,
as
I
got
nearer
to
the
marshy
side
of
the
lake
.
<EOS>
I
saw
here
,
lying
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
water
,
the
rotten
wreck
of
an
old
overturned
boat
,
with
a
sickly
spot
of
sunlight
glimmering
through
a
gap
in
the
trees
on
its
dry
surface
,
and
a
snake
basking
in
the
midst
of
the
spot
,
fantastically
coiled
and
treacherously
still
.
<EOS>
Far
and
near
the
view
suggested
the
same
dreary
impressions
of
solitude
and
decay
,
and
the
glorious
brightness
of
the
summer
sky
overhead
seemed
only
to
deepen
and
harden
the
gloom
and
barrenness
of
the
wilderness
on
which
it
shone
.
<EOS>
I
turned
and
retraced
my
steps
to
the
high
heathy
ground
,
directing
them
a
little
aside
from
my
former
path
towards
a
shabby
old
wooden
shed
,
which
stood
on
the
outer
skirt
of
the
fir
plantation
,
and
which
had
hitherto
been
too
unimportant
to
share
my
notice
with
the
wide
,
wild
prospect
of
the
lake
.
  
<EOS>
On
approaching
the
shed
I
found
that
it
had
once
been
a
boat
-
house
,
and
that
an
attempt
had
apparently
been
made
to
convert
it
afterwards
into
a
sort
of
rude
arbour
,
by
placing
inside
it
a
firwood
seat
,
a
few
stools
,
and
a
table
.
<EOS>
I
entered
the
place
,
and
sat
down
for
a
little
while
to
rest
and
get
my
breath
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
not
been
in
the
boat
-
house
more
than
a
minute
when
it
struck
me
that
the
sound
of
my
own
quick
breathing
was
very
strangely
echoed
by
something
beneath
me
.
<EOS>
I
listened
intently
for
a
moment
,
and
heard
a
low
,
thick
,
sobbing
breath
that
seemed
to
come
from
the
ground
under
the
seat
which
I
was
occupying
.
<EOS>
My
nerves
are
not
easily
shaken
by
trifles
,
but
on
this
occasion
I
started
to
my
feet
in
a
fright
 
called
out
 
received
no
answer
 
summoned
back
my
recreant
courage
,
and
looked
under
the
seat
.
  
<EOS>
There
,
crouched
up
in
the
farthest
corner
,
lay
the
forlorn
cause
of
my
terror
,
in
the
shape
of
a
poor
little
dog
 
a
black
and
white
spaniel
.
<EOS>
The
creature
moaned
feebly
when
I
looked
at
it
and
called
to
it
,
but
never
stirred
.
<EOS>
I
moved
away
the
seat
and
looked
closer
.
<EOS>
The
poor
little
dog
's
eyes
were
glazing
fast
,
and
there
were
spots
of
blood
on
its
glossy
white
side
.
<EOS>
The
misery
of
a
weak
,
helpless
,
dumb
creature
is
surely
one
of
the
saddest
of
all
the
mournful
sights
which
this
world
can
show
.
<EOS>
I
lifted
the
poor
dog
in
my
arms
as
gently
as
I
could
,
and
contrived
a
sort
of
make
-
shift
hammock
for
him
to
lie
in
,
by
gathering
up
the
front
of
my
dress
all
round
him
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
I
took
the
creature
,
as
painlessly
as
possible
,
and
as
fast
as
possible
,
back
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Finding
no
one
in
the
hall
<EOS>
I
went
up
at
once
to
my
own
sitting
-
room
,
made
a
bed
for
the
dog
with
one
of
my
old
shawls
,
and
rang
the
bell
.
<EOS>
The
largest
and
fattest
of
all
possible
house
-
maids
answered
it
,
in
a
state
of
cheerful
stupidity
which
would
have
provoked
the
patience
of
a
saint
.
<EOS>
The
girl
's
fat
,
shapeless
face
actually
stretched
into
a
broad
grin
at
the
sight
of
the
wounded
creature
on
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
see
there
to
laugh
at
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
as
angrily
as
if
she
had
been
a
servant
of
my
own
.
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
whose
dog
it
is
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
miss
,
that
I
certainly
do
n't
.
<EOS>
"
She
stooped
,
and
looked
down
at
the
spaniel
's
injured
side
 
brightened
suddenly
with
the
irradiation
of
a
new
idea
 
and
pointing
to
the
wound
with
a
chuckle
of
satisfaction
,
said
,
"
That
's
Baxter
's
doings
,
that
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
so
exasperated
that
I
could
have
boxed
her
ears
.
<EOS>
"
Baxter
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
the
brute
you
call
Baxter
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
girl
grinned
again
more
cheerfully
than
ever
.
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
,
miss
!
<EOS>
Baxter
's
the
keeper
,
and
<EOS>
when
he
finds
strange
dogs
hunting
about
,
he
takes
and
shoots
'em
.
<EOS>
It
's
keeper
's
dooty
miss
,
I
think
that
dog
will
die
.
<EOS>
Here
's
where
he
's
been
shot
,
ai
n't
it
?
<EOS>
That
's
Baxter
's
doings
,
that
is
.
<EOS>
Baxter
's
doings
,
miss
,
and
Baxter
's
dooty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
almost
wicked
enough
to
wish
that
Baxter
had
shot
the
housemaid
instead
of
the
dog
.
<EOS>
Seeing
that
it
was
quite
useless
to
expect
this
densely
impenetrable
personage
to
give
me
any
help
in
relieving
the
suffering
creature
at
our
feet
,
I
told
her
to
request
the
housekeeper
's
attendance
with
my
compliments
.
<EOS>
She
went
out
exactly
as
she
had
come
in
,
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
.
<EOS>
As
the
door
closed
on
her
she
said
to
herself
softly
,
"
It
's
Baxter
's
doings
and
Baxter
's
dooty
 
<EOS>
that
's
what
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
housekeeper
,
a
person
of
some
education
and
intelligence
,
thoughtfully
brought
upstairs
with
her
some
milk
and
some
warm
water
.
<EOS>
The
instant
she
saw
the
dog
on
the
floor
she
started
and
changed
colour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Lord
bless
me
,
"
cried
the
housekeeper
,
"
that
must
be
Mrs.
Catherick
's
dog
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whose
?
"
I
asked
,
in
the
utmost
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Catherick
's
.
<EOS>
You
seem
to
know
Mrs.
Catherick
,
Miss
Halcombe
?
"
  
"
Not
personally
,
but
I
have
heard
of
her
.
<EOS>
Does
she
live
here
?
<EOS>
Has
she
had
any
news
of
her
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
she
came
here
to
ask
for
news
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
When
?
"
  
"
Only
yesterday
.
<EOS>
She
said
some
one
had
reported
that
a
stranger
answering
to
the
description
of
her
daughter
had
been
seen
in
our
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
No
such
report
has
reached
us
here
,
and
no
such
report
was
known
in
the
village
,
when
I
sent
to
make
inquiries
there
on
Mrs.
Catherick
's
account
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
brought
this
poor
little
dog
with
her
when
she
came
,
and
I
saw
it
trot
out
after
her
when
she
went
away
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
creature
strayed
into
the
plantations
,
and
got
shot
.
<EOS>
Where
did
you
find
it
,
Miss
Halcombe
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
old
shed
that
looks
out
on
the
lake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
yes
,
that
is
the
plantation
side
,
and
the
poor
thing
dragged
itself
,
I
suppose
,
to
the
nearest
shelter
,
as
dogs
<EOS>
will
,
to
die
.
<EOS>
If
you
can
moisten
its
lips
with
the
milk
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
I
will
wash
the
clotted
hair
from
the
wound
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
much
afraid
it
is
too
late
to
do
any
good
.
<EOS>
However
,
we
can
but
try
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Catherick
!
<EOS>
The
name
still
rang
in
my
ears
,
as
if
the
housekeeper
had
only
that
moment
surprised
me
by
uttering
it
.
<EOS>
While
we
were
attending
to
the
dog
,
the
words
of
Walter
Hartright
's
caution
to
me
returned
to
my
memory
:
"
If
ever
Anne
Catherick
crosses
your
path
,
make
better
use
of
the
opportunity
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
than
I
made
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
finding
of
the
wounded
spaniel
had
led
me
already
to
the
discovery
of
Mrs.
Catherick
's
visit
to
Blackwater
Park
,
and
that
event
might
lead
in
its
turn
,
to
something
more
.
<EOS>
I
determined
to
make
the
most
of
the
chance
which
was
now
offered
to
me
,
and
to
gain
as
much
information
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
say
that
Mrs.
Catherick
lived
anywhere
in
this
neighbourhood
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
no
,
"
said
the
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
"
She
lives
at
Welmingham
,
quite
at
the
other
end
of
the
county
 
five
-
and
-
twenty
miles
off
,
at
least
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
have
known
Mrs.
Catherick
for
some
years
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
I
never
saw
her
before
she
came
here
yesterday
.
<EOS>
I
had
heard
of
her
,
of
course
,
because
I
had
heard
of
Sir
Percival
's
kindness
in
putting
her
daughter
under
medical
care
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Catherick
is
rather
a
strange
person
in
her
manners
,
but
extremely
respectable
-
looking
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
sorely
put
out
when
she
found
that
there
was
no
foundation
 
<EOS>
none
,
at
least
,
that
any
of
us
could
discover
 
for
the
report
of
her
daughter
having
been
seen
in
this
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
rather
interested
about
Mrs.
Catherick
,
"
<EOS>
I
went
on
,
continuing
the
conversation
as
long
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
had
arrived
here
soon
enough
to
see
her
yesterday
.
<EOS>
Did
she
stay
for
any
length
of
time
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
the
housekeeper
,
"
she
stayed
for
some
time
;
and
I
think
she
would
have
remained
longer
,
if
I
had
not
been
called
away
to
speak
to
a
strange
gentleman
 
a
gentleman
who
came
to
ask
when
Sir
Percival
was
expected
back
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Catherick
got
up
and
left
at
once
,
when
she
heard
the
maid
tell
me
what
the
visitor
's
errand
was
.
<EOS>
She
said
to
me
,
at
parting
,
that
there
was
no
need
to
tell
Sir
Percival
of
her
coming
here
.
<EOS>
I
thought
that
rather
an
odd
remark
to
make
,
especially
to
a
person
in
my
responsible
situation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thought
it
an
odd
remark
too
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
had
certainly
led
me
to
believe
,
at
Limmeridge
,
that
the
most
perfect
confidence
existed
between
himself
and
Mrs.
Catherick
.
<EOS>
If
that
was
the
case
,
why
should
she
be
anxious
to
have
<EOS>
her
visit
at
Blackwater
Park
kept
a
secret
from
him
?
  
<EOS>
"
Probably
,
"
I
said
,
seeing
that
the
housekeeper
expected
me
to
give
my
opinion
on
Mrs.
Catherick
's
parting
words
<EOS>
,
"
probably
she
thought
the
announcement
of
her
visit
might
vex
Sir
Percival
to
no
purpose
,
by
reminding
him
that
her
lost
daughter
was
not
found
yet
.
<EOS>
Did
she
talk
much
on
that
subject
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
little
,
"
replied
the
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
"
She
talked
principally
of
Sir
Percival
,
and
asked
a
great
many
questions
about
where
he
had
been
travelling
,
and
what
sort
of
lady
his
new
wife
was
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
be
more
soured
and
put
out
than
distressed
,
by
failing
to
find
any
traces
of
her
daughter
in
these
parts
.
<EOS>
"
I
give
her
up
,
"
were
the
last
words
she
said
that
I
can
remember
;
"
I
give
her
up
,
ma'am
,
for
lost
.
"
<EOS>
And
from
that
she
passed
at
once
to
her
questions
about
Lady
Glyde
,
wanting
to
know
if
she
was
a
handsome
,
amiable
lady
,
comely
and
healthy
and
young
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
dear
!
<EOS>
I
thought
how
it
would
end
.
<EOS>
Look
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
the
poor
thing
is
out
of
its
misery
at
last
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
dog
was
dead
.
<EOS>
It
had
given
a
faint
,
sobbing
cry
,
it
had
suffered
an
instant
's
convulsion
of
the
limbs
,
just
as
those
last
words
,
"
comely
and
healthy
and
young
,
"
dropped
from
the
housekeeper
's
lips
.
<EOS>
The
change
had
happened
with
startling
suddenness
 
in
one
moment
the
creature
lay
lifeless
under
our
hands
.
  
<EOS>
Eight
o'clock
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
returned
from
dining
downstairs
,
in
solitary
state
.
<EOS>
The
sunset
is
burning
redly
on
the
wilderness
of
trees
that
I
see
from
my
window
,
and
I
am
poring
over
my
journal
again
,
to
calm
my
impatience
for
the
return
of
the
travellers
.
<EOS>
They
ought
to
have
arrived
,
by
my
calculations
,
before
this
.
<EOS>
How
still
and
lonely
the
house
is
in
the
drowsy
evening
quiet
!
<EOS>
Oh
me
!
<EOS>
how
many
minutes
more
before
I
hear
the
carriage
wheels
and
run
downstairs
to
find
myself
in
Laura
's
arms
?
  
<EOS>
The
poor
little
dog
!
<EOS>
I
wish
my
first
day
at
Blackwater
Park
had
not
been
associated
with
death
,
though
it
is
only
the
death
of
a
stray
animal
.
  
<EOS>
Welmingham
 
<EOS>
I
see
,
on
looking
back
through
these
private
pages
of
mine
,
that
Welmingham
is
the
name
of
the
place
where
Mrs.
Catherick
lives
.
<EOS>
Her
note
is
still
in
my
possession
,
the
note
in
answer
to
that
letter
about
her
unhappy
daughter
which
Sir
Percival
obliged
me
to
write
.
<EOS>
One
of
these
days
,
when
I
can
find
a
safe
opportunity
,
I
will
take
the
note
with
me
by
way
of
introduction
,
and
try
what
I
can
make
of
Mrs.
Catherick
at
a
personal
interview
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
understand
her
wishing
to
conceal
her
visit
to
this
place
from
Sir
Percival
's
knowledge
,
and
I
do
n't
feel
half
so
sure
,
as
the
housekeeper
seems
to
do
,
that
her
daughter
Anne
is
not
in
the
neighbourhood
after
all
.
<EOS>
What
would
Walter
Hartright
have
said
in
this
emergency
?
<EOS>
Poor
,
dear
Hartright
!
<EOS>
I
am
beginning
to
feel
the
want
of
his
honest
advice
and
his
willing
help
already
.
  
<EOS>
Surely
I
heard
something
.
<EOS>
Was
it
a
bustle
of
footsteps
below
stairs
?
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
I
hear
the
horses
'
feet
 
<EOS>
I
hear
the
rolling
wheels
      
June
15th
.
 
<EOS>
The
confusion
of
their
arrival
has
had
time
to
subside
.
<EOS>
Two
days
have
elapsed
since
the
return
of
the
travellers
,
and
that
interval
has
sufficed
to
put
the
new
machinery
of
our
lives
at
Blackwater
Park
in
fair
working
order
.
<EOS>
I
may
now
return
to
my
journal
,
with
some
little
chance
of
being
able
to
continue
the
entries
in
it
as
collectedly
as
usual
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
must
begin
by
putting
down
an
odd
remark
which
has
suggested
itself
to
me
since
Laura
came
back
.
  
<EOS>
When
two
members
of
a
family
or
two
intimate
friends
are
separated
,
and
one
goes
abroad
and
one
remains
at
home
,
the
return
of
the
relative
or
friend
who
has
been
travelling
always
seems
to
place
the
relative
or
friend
who
has
been
staying
at
home
at
a
painful
disadvantage
when
the
two
first
meet
.
<EOS>
The
sudden
encounter
of
the
new
thoughts
and
new
habits
eagerly
gained
in
the
one
case
,
with
the
old
thoughts
and
old
habits
passively
preserved
in
the
other
,
seems
at
first
to
part
the
sympathies
of
the
most
loving
relatives
and
the
fondest
friends
,
and
to
set
a
sudden
strangeness
,
unexpected
by
both
and
uncontrollable
by
both
,
between
them
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
After
the
first
happiness
of
my
meeting
with
Laura
was
over
,
after
we
had
sat
down
together
hand
in
hand
to
recover
breath
enough
and
calmness
enough
to
talk
,
I
felt
this
strangeness
instantly
,
and
I
could
see
that
she
felt
it
too
.
<EOS>
It
has
partially
worn
away
,
now
that
we
have
fallen
back
into
most
of
our
old
habits
,
and
it
will
probably
disappear
before
long
.
<EOS>
But
it
has
certainly
had
an
influence
over
the
first
impressions
that
I
have
formed
of
her
,
now
that
we
are
living
together
again
 
for
which
reason
only
I
have
thought
fit
to
mention
it
here
.
  
<EOS>
She
has
found
me
unaltered
,
but
I
have
found
her
changed
.
  
<EOS>
Changed
in
person
,
and
in
one
respect
changed
in
character
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
absolutely
say
that
she
is
less
beautiful
than
she
used
to
be
 
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
that
she
is
less
beautiful
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
Others
,
who
do
not
look
at
her
with
my
eyes
and
my
recollections
,
would
probably
think
her
improved
.
<EOS>
There
is
more
colour
and
more
decision
and
roundness
of
outline
in
her
face
than
there
used
to
be
,
and
her
figure
seems
more
firmly
set
and
more
sure
and
easy
in
all
its
movements
than
it
was
in
her
maiden
days
.
<EOS>
But
I
miss
something
when
I
look
at
her
 
something
that
once
belonged
to
the
happy
,
innocent
life
of
Laura
Fairlie
,
and
that
I
can
not
find
in
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
There
was
in
the
old
times
a
freshness
,
a
softness
,
an
ever
-
varying
and
yet
ever
-
remaining
tenderness
of
beauty
in
her
face
,
the
charm
of
which
it
is
not
possible
to
express
in
words
,
or
,
as
poor
Hartright
used
often
to
say
,
in
painting
either
.
<EOS>
This
is
gone
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
saw
the
faint
reflection
of
it
for
a
moment
when
she
turned
pale
under
the
agitation
of
our
sudden
meeting
on
the
evening
of
her
return
,
but
it
has
never
reappeared
since
.
<EOS>
None
of
her
letters
had
prepared
me
for
a
personal
change
in
her
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
they
had
led
me
to
expect
that
her
marriage
had
left
her
,
in
appearance
at
least
,
quite
unaltered
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
read
her
letters
wrongly
in
the
past
,
and
am
now
reading
her
face
wrongly
in
the
present
?
<EOS>
No
matter
!
<EOS>
Whether
her
beauty
has
gained
or
whether
it
has
lost
in
the
last
six
months
,
the
separation
either
way
has
made
her
own
dear
self
more
precious
to
me
than
ever
,
and
that
is
one
good
result
of
her
marriage
,
at
any
rate
!
  
<EOS>
The
second
change
,
the
change
that
I
have
observed
in
her
character
,
has
not
surprised
me
,
because
I
was
prepared
for
it
in
this
case
by
the
tone
of
her
letters
.
<EOS>
Now
that
she
is
at
home
again
,
I
find
her
just
as
unwilling
to
enter
into
any
details
on
the
subject
of
her
married
life
as
I
had
previously
found
her
all
through
the
time
of
our
separation
,
when
we
could
only
communicate
with
each
other
by
writing
.
<EOS>
At
the
first
approach
I
made
to
the
forbidden
topic
she
put
her
hand
on
my
lips
with
a
look
and
gesture
which
touchingly
,
almost
painfully
,
recalled
to
my
memory
the
days
of
her
girlhood
and
the
happy
bygone
time
when
there
were
no
secrets
between
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whenever
you
and
I
are
together
,
<EOS>
Marian
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
,
"
we
shall
both
be
happier
and
easier
with
one
another
,
if
we
accept
my
married
life
for
what
it
is
,
and
say
and
think
as
little
about
it
as
possible
.
<EOS>
I
would
tell
you
everything
,
darling
,
about
myself
,
"
she
went
on
,
nervously
buckling
and
unbuckling
the
ribbon
<EOS>
round
my
waist
,
"
if
my
confidences
could
only
end
there
.
<EOS>
But
they
could
not
 
they
would
lead
me
into
confidences
about
my
husband
too
;
and
now
I
am
married
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
had
better
avoid
them
,
for
his
sake
,
and
for
your
sake
,
and
for
mine
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
that
they
would
distress
you
,
or
distress
me
 
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
you
think
that
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
But
 
I
want
to
be
so
happy
,
now
I
have
got
you
back
again
,
and
I
want
you
to
be
so
happy
<EOS>
too
 
<EOS>
"
She
broke
off
abruptly
,
and
looked
round
<EOS>
the
room
,
my
own
sitting
-
room
,
in
which
we
were
talking
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
clapping
her
hands
with
a
bright
smile
of
recognition
,
"
another
old
friend
found
already
!
<EOS>
Your
book
-
case
,
Marian
 
<EOS>
your
dear
-
little
-
shabby
-
old
-
satin
-
wood
book
-
case
 
<EOS>
how
glad
I
am
you
brought
it
with
you
from
Limmeridge
!
<EOS>
And
the
horrid
heavy
man
's
umbrella
,
that
you
always
would
walk
out
with
when
it
rained
!
<EOS>
And
first
and
foremost
of
all
,
your
own
dear
,
dark
,
clever
,
gipsy
-
face
,
looking
at
me
just
as
usual
!
<EOS>
It
is
so
like
home
again
to
be
here
.
<EOS>
How
can
we
make
it
more
like
home
still
?
<EOS>
I
will
put
my
father
's
portrait
in
your
room
instead
of
in
mine
 
<EOS>
and
I
will
keep
all
my
little
treasures
from
Limmeridge
here
 
<EOS>
and
we
will
pass
hours
and
hours
every
day
with
these
four
friendly
walls
round
us
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Marian
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
suddenly
seating
herself
on
a
footstool
at
my
knees
,
and
looking
up
earnestly
in
my
face
,
"
promise
you
will
never
marry
,
and
leave
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
selfish
to
say
so
,
but
you
are
so
much
better
off
as
a
single
woman
 
unless
 
unless
you
are
very
fond
of
your
husband
 
<EOS>
but
you
wo
n't
be
very
fond
of
anybody
but
me
,
will
you
?
"
<EOS>
She
stopped
again
,
crossed
my
hands
on
my
lap
,
and
laid
her
face
on
them
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
been
writing
many
letters
,
and
receiving
many
letters
lately
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
in
low
,
suddenly
-
altered
tones
.
<EOS>
I
understood
what
the
question
meant
,
but
I
thought
it
my
duty
not
to
encourage
her
by
meeting
her
half
way
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
from
him
?
<EOS>
"
she
went
on
,
coaxing
me
to
forgive
the
more
direct
appeal
on
which
she
now
ventured
,
by
kissing
my
hands
,
upon
which
her
face
still
rested
.
<EOS>
"
Is
he
well
and
happy
,
and
getting
on
in
his
profession
?
<EOS>
Has
he
recovered
himself
 
and
forgotten
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
should
not
have
asked
those
questions
.
<EOS>
She
should
have
remembered
her
own
resolution
,
on
the
morning
when
Sir
Percival
held
her
to
her
marriage
engagement
,
and
when
she
resigned
the
book
of
Hartright
's
drawings
into
my
hands
for
ever
.
<EOS>
But
,
ah
me
!
<EOS>
where
is
the
faultless
human
creature
who
can
persevere
in
a
good
resolution
,
without
sometimes
failing
and
falling
back
?
<EOS>
Where
is
the
woman
who
has
ever
really
torn
from
her
heart
the
image
that
has
been
once
fixed
in
it
by
a
true
love
?
<EOS>
Books
tell
us
that
such
unearthly
creatures
have
existed
 
but
what
does
our
own
experience
say
in
answer
to
books
?
  
<EOS>
I
made
no
attempt
to
remonstrate
with
her
:
perhaps
,
because
I
sincerely
appreciated
the
fearless
candour
which
let
me
see
,
what
other
women
in
her
position
might
have
had
reasons
for
concealing
even
from
their
dearest
friends
 
perhaps
,
because
I
felt
,
in
my
own
heart
and
conscience
,
that
in
her
place
I
should
have
asked
the
same
questions
and
had
the
same
thoughts
.
<EOS>
All
I
could
honestly
do
was
to
reply
that
I
had
not
written
to
him
or
heard
from
him
lately
,
and
then
to
turn
the
conversation
to
less
dangerous
topics
.
  
<EOS>
There
has
been
much
to
sadden
me
in
our
interview
 
my
first
confidential
interview
with
her
since
her
return
.
<EOS>
The
change
which
her
marriage
has
produced
in
our
relations
towards
each
other
,
by
placing
a
forbidden
subject
between
us
,
for
the
first
time
in
our
lives
;
the
melancholy
conviction
of
the
dearth
of
all
warmth
of
feeling
,
of
all
close
sympathy
,
between
her
husband
and
herself
,
which
her
own
unwilling
words
now
force
on
my
mind
;
the
distressing
discovery
that
the
influence
of
that
ill
-
fated
attachment
still
remains
(
no
matter
how
innocently
,
how
harmlessly
)
rooted
as
deeply
as
ever
in
her
heart
 
<EOS>
all
these
are
disclosures
to
sadden
any
woman
who
loves
her
as
dearly
,
and
feels
for
her
as
acutely
,
as
I
do
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
only
one
consolation
to
set
against
them
 
a
consolation
that
ought
to
comfort
me
,
and
that
does
comfort
me
.
<EOS>
All
the
graces
and
gentleness
of
her
character
 
<EOS>
all
the
frank
affection
of
her
nature
 
<EOS>
all
the
sweet
,
simple
,
womanly
charms
which
used
to
make
her
the
darling
and
delight
of
every
one
who
approached
her
,
have
come
back
to
me
with
herself
.
<EOS>
Of
my
other
impressions
I
am
sometimes
a
little
inclined
to
doubt
.
<EOS>
Of
this
last
,
best
,
happiest
of
all
impressions
,
I
grow
more
and
more
certain
every
hour
in
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
Let
me
turn
,
now
,
from
her
to
her
travelling
companions
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
must
engage
my
attention
first
.
<EOS>
What
have
I
observed
in
Sir
Percival
,
since
his
return
,
to
improve
my
opinion
of
him
?
  
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
say
.
<EOS>
Small
vexations
and
annoyances
seem
to
have
beset
him
since
he
came
back
,
and
no
man
,
under
those
circumstances
,
is
ever
presented
at
his
best
.
<EOS>
He
looks
,
as
I
think
,
thinner
than
he
was
when
he
left
England
.
<EOS>
His
wearisome
cough
and
his
comfortless
restlessness
have
certainly
increased
.
<EOS>
His
manner
 
at
least
his
manner
towards
me
 
is
much
more
abrupt
than
it
used
to
be
.
<EOS>
He
greeted
me
,
on
the
evening
of
his
return
,
with
little
or
nothing
of
the
ceremony
and
civility
of
former
times
 
<EOS>
no
polite
speeches
of
welcome
 
<EOS>
no
appearance
of
extraordinary
gratification
at
seeing
me
 
nothing
but
a
short
shake
of
the
hand
,
and
a
sharp
"
How
-
d'ye
-
do
,
Miss
Halcombe
 
<EOS>
glad
to
see
you
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
accept
me
as
one
of
the
necessary
fixtures
of
Blackwater
Park
,
to
be
satisfied
at
finding
me
established
in
my
proper
place
,
and
then
to
pass
me
over
altogether
.
  
<EOS>
Most
men
show
something
of
their
disposition
in
their
own
houses
,
which
they
have
concealed
elsewhere
,
and
Sir
Percival
has
already
displayed
a
mania
for
order
and
regularity
,
which
is
quite
a
new
revelation
of
him
,
so
far
as
my
previous
knowledge
of
his
character
is
concerned
.
<EOS>
If
I
take
a
book
from
the
library
and
leave
it
on
the
table
,
he
follows
me
and
puts
it
back
again
.
<EOS>
If
I
rise
from
a
chair
,
and
let
it
remain
where
I
have
been
sitting
,
he
carefully
restores
it
to
its
proper
place
against
the
wall
.
<EOS>
He
picks
up
stray
flower
-
blossoms
from
the
carpet
,
and
mutters
to
himself
as
discontentedly
as
if
they
were
hot
cinders
burning
holes
in
it
,
and
he
storms
at
the
servants
if
there
is
a
crease
in
the
tablecloth
,
or
a
knife
missing
from
its
place
at
the
dinner
-
table
,
as
fiercely
as
if
they
had
personally
insulted
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
already
referred
to
the
small
annoyances
which
appear
to
have
troubled
him
since
his
return
.
<EOS>
Much
of
the
alteration
for
the
worse
which
I
have
noticed
in
him
may
be
due
to
these
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
persuade
myself
that
it
is
so
,
because
I
am
anxious
not
to
be
disheartened
already
about
the
future
.
<EOS>
It
is
certainly
trying
to
any
man
's
temper
to
be
met
by
a
vexation
the
moment
he
sets
foot
in
his
own
house
again
,
after
a
long
absence
,
and
this
annoying
circumstance
did
really
happen
to
Sir
Percival
in
my
presence
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
evening
of
their
arrival
the
housekeeper
followed
me
into
the
hall
to
receive
her
master
and
mistress
and
their
guests
.
<EOS>
The
instant
he
saw
her
,
Sir
Percival
asked
if
any
one
had
called
lately
.
<EOS>
The
housekeeper
mentioned
to
him
,
in
reply
,
what
she
had
previously
mentioned
to
me
,
the
visit
of
the
strange
gentleman
to
make
inquiries
about
the
time
of
her
master
's
return
.
<EOS>
He
asked
immediately
for
the
gentleman
's
name
.
<EOS>
No
name
had
been
left
.
<EOS>
The
gentleman
's
business
?
<EOS>
No
business
had
been
mentioned
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
gentleman
like
?
<EOS>
The
housekeeper
tried
to
describe
him
,
but
failed
to
distinguish
the
nameless
visitor
by
any
personal
peculiarity
which
her
master
could
recognise
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
frowned
,
stamped
angrily
on
the
floor
,
and
walked
on
into
the
house
,
taking
no
notice
of
anybody
.
<EOS>
Why
he
should
have
been
so
discomposed
by
a
trifle
I
can
not
say
 
<EOS>
but
he
was
seriously
discomposed
,
beyond
all
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
,
it
will
be
best
,
perhaps
,
if
I
abstain
from
forming
a
decisive
opinion
of
his
manners
,
language
,
and
conduct
in
his
own
house
,
until
time
has
enabled
him
to
shake
off
the
anxieties
,
whatever
they
may
be
,
which
now
evidently
troubled
his
mind
in
secret
.
<EOS>
I
will
turn
over
to
a
new
page
,
and
my
pen
shall
let
Laura
's
husband
alone
for
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
guests
 
the
Count
and
Countess
Fosco
 
come
next
in
my
catalogue
.
<EOS>
I
will
dispose
of
the
Countess
first
,
so
as
to
have
done
with
the
woman
as
soon
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
Laura
was
certainly
not
chargeable
with
any
exaggeration
,
in
writing
me
word
that
I
should
hardly
recognise
her
aunt
again
when
we
met
.
<EOS>
Never
before
have
I
beheld
such
a
change
produced
in
a
woman
by
her
marriage
as
has
been
produced
in
Madame
Fosco
.
  
<EOS>
As
Eleanor
Fairlie
(
aged
seven
-
and
-
thirty
)
,
she
was
always
talking
pretentious
nonsense
,
and
always
worrying
the
unfortunate
men
with
every
small
exaction
which
a
vain
and
foolish
woman
can
impose
on
long
-
suffering
male
humanity
.
<EOS>
As
Madame
Fosco
(
aged
three
-
and
-
forty
)
,
she
sits
for
hours
together
without
saying
a
word
,
frozen
up
in
the
strangest
manner
in
herself
.
<EOS>
The
hideously
ridiculous
love
-
locks
which
used
to
hang
on
either
side
of
her
face
are
now
replaced
by
stiff
little
rows
of
very
short
curls
,
of
the
sort
one
sees
in
old
-
fashioned
wigs
.
<EOS>
A
plain
,
matronly
cap
covers
her
head
,
and
makes
her
look
,
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
since
I
remember
her
,
like
a
decent
woman
.
<EOS>
Nobody
(
putting
her
husband
out
of
the
question
,
of
course
)
now
sees
in
her
,
what
everybody
once
saw
 
<EOS>
I
mean
the
structure
of
the
female
skeleton
,
in
the
upper
regions
of
the
collar
-
bones
and
the
shoulder
-
blades
.
<EOS>
Clad
in
quiet
black
or
grey
gowns
,
made
high
round
the
throat
 
<EOS>
dresses
that
she
would
have
laughed
at
,
or
screamed
at
,
as
the
whim
of
the
moment
inclined
her
,
in
her
maiden
days
 
<EOS>
she
sits
speechless
in
corners
;
her
dry
white
hands
(
so
dry
that
the
pores
of
her
skin
look
chalky
)
incessantly
engaged
,
either
in
monotonous
embroidery
work
or
in
rolling
up
endless
cigarettes
for
the
Count
's
own
particular
smoking
.
<EOS>
On
the
few
occasions
when
her
cold
blue
eyes
are
off
her
work
,
they
are
generally
turned
on
her
husband
,
with
the
look
of
mute
submissive
inquiry
which
we
are
all
familiar
with
in
the
eyes
of
a
faithful
dog
.
<EOS>
The
only
approach
to
an
inward
thaw
which
I
have
yet
detected
under
her
outer
covering
of
icy
constraint
,
has
betrayed
itself
,
once
or
twice
,
in
the
form
of
a
suppressed
tigerish
jealousy
of
any
woman
in
the
house
(
the
maids
included
)
to
whom
the
Count
speaks
,
or
on
whom
he
looks
with
anything
approaching
to
special
interest
or
attention
.
<EOS>
Except
in
this
one
particular
,
she
is
always
,
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
,
indoors
and
out
,
fair
weather
or
foul
,
as
cold
as
a
statue
,
and
as
impenetrable
as
the
stone
out
of
which
it
is
cut
.
<EOS>
For
the
common
purposes
of
society
the
extraordinary
change
thus
produced
in
her
is
,
beyond
all
doubt
,
a
change
for
the
better
,
seeing
that
it
has
transformed
her
into
a
civil
,
silent
,
unobtrusive
woman
,
who
is
never
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
How
far
she
is
really
reformed
or
deteriorated
in
her
secret
self
,
is
another
question
.
<EOS>
I
have
once
or
twice
seen
sudden
changes
of
expression
on
her
pinched
lips
,
and
heard
sudden
inflexions
of
tone
in
her
calm
voice
,
which
have
led
me
to
suspect
that
her
present
state
of
suppression
may
have
sealed
up
something
dangerous
in
her
nature
,
which
used
to
evaporate
harmlessly
in
the
freedom
of
her
former
life
.
<EOS>
It
is
quite
possible
that
I
may
be
altogether
wrong
in
this
idea
.
<EOS>
My
own
impression
,
however
,
is
,
that
I
am
right
.
<EOS>
Time
will
show
.
  
<EOS>
And
the
magician
who
has
wrought
this
wonderful
transformation
 
the
foreign
husband
who
has
tamed
this
once
wayward
English
woman
till
her
own
relations
hardly
know
her
again
 
the
Count
himself
?
<EOS>
What
of
the
Count
?
  
<EOS>
This
in
two
words
<EOS>
:
He
looks
like
a
man
who
could
tame
anything
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
married
a
tigress
,
instead
of
a
woman
,
he
would
have
tamed
the
tigress
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
married
me
,
I
should
have
made
his
cigarettes
,
as
his
wife
does
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
held
my
tongue
when
he
looked
at
me
,
as
she
holds
hers
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
almost
afraid
to
confess
it
,
even
to
these
secret
pages
.
<EOS>
The
man
has
interested
me
,
has
attracted
me
,
has
forced
me
to
like
him
.
<EOS>
In
two
short
days
he
has
made
his
way
straight
into
my
favourable
estimation
,
and
how
he
has
worked
the
miracle
is
more
than
I
can
tell
.
  
<EOS>
It
absolutely
startles
me
,
now
he
is
in
my
mind
,
to
find
how
plainly
I
see
him
!
 
<EOS>
how
much
more
plainly
than
I
see
Sir
Percival
,
or
Mr.
Fairlie
,
or
Walter
Hartright
,
or
any
other
absent
person
of
whom
I
think
,
with
the
one
exception
of
Laura
herself
!
<EOS>
I
can
hear
his
voice
,
as
if
he
was
speaking
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
his
conversation
was
yesterday
,
as
well
as
if
I
was
hearing
it
now
.
<EOS>
How
am
I
to
describe
him
?
<EOS>
There
are
peculiarities
in
his
personal
appearance
,
his
habits
,
and
his
amusements
,
which
I
should
blame
in
the
boldest
terms
,
or
ridicule
in
the
most
merciless
manner
,
if
I
had
seen
them
in
another
man
.
<EOS>
What
is
it
that
makes
me
unable
to
blame
them
,
or
to
ridicule
them
in
HIM
?
  
<EOS>
For
example
,
he
is
immensely
fat
.
<EOS>
Before
this
time
I
have
always
especially
disliked
corpulent
humanity
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
maintained
that
the
popular
notion
of
connecting
excessive
grossness
of
size
and
excessive
good
-
humour
as
inseparable
allies
was
equivalent
to
declaring
,
either
that
no
people
but
amiable
people
ever
get
fat
,
or
that
the
accidental
addition
of
so
many
pounds
of
flesh
has
a
directly
favourable
influence
over
the
disposition
of
the
person
on
whose
body
they
accumulate
.
<EOS>
I
have
invariably
combated
both
these
absurd
assertions
by
quoting
examples
of
fat
people
who
were
as
mean
,
vicious
,
and
cruel
as
the
leanest
and
the
worst
of
their
neighbours
.
<EOS>
I
have
asked
whether
Henry
the
Eighth
was
an
amiable
character
?
<EOS>
Whether
Pope
Alexander
the
Sixth
was
a
good
man
?
<EOS>
Whether
Mr.
Murderer
and
Mrs.
Murderess
Manning
were
not
both
unusually
stout
people
?
<EOS>
Whether
hired
nurses
,
proverbially
as
cruel
a
set
of
women
as
are
to
be
found
in
all
England
,
were
not
,
for
the
most
part
,
also
as
fat
a
set
of
women
as
are
to
be
found
in
all
England
?
 
<EOS>
and
so
on
,
through
dozens
of
other
examples
,
modern
and
ancient
,
native
and
foreign
,
high
and
low
.
<EOS>
Holding
these
strong
opinions
on
the
subject
with
might
and
main
as
I
do
at
this
moment
,
here
,
nevertheless
,
is
Count
Fosco
,
as
fat
as
Henry
the
Eighth
himself
,
established
in
my
favour
,
at
one
day
's
notice
,
without
let
or
hindrance
from
his
own
odious
corpulence
.
<EOS>
Marvellous
indeed
!
  
<EOS>
Is
it
his
face
that
has
recommended
him
?
  
<EOS>
It
may
be
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
most
remarkable
likeness
,
on
a
large
scale
,
of
the
great
Napoleon
.
<EOS>
His
features
have
Napoleon
's
magnificent
regularity
 
his
expression
recalls
the
grandly
calm
,
immovable
power
of
the
Great
Soldier
's
face
.
<EOS>
This
striking
resemblance
certainly
impressed
me
,
to
begin
with
;
but
there
is
something
in
him
besides
the
resemblance
,
which
has
impressed
me
more
.
<EOS>
I
think
the
influence
I
am
now
trying
to
find
is
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
They
are
the
most
unfathomable
grey
eyes
I
ever
saw
,
and
they
have
at
times
a
cold
,
clear
,
beautiful
,
irresistible
glitter
in
them
which
forces
me
to
look
at
him
,
and
yet
causes
me
sensations
,
when
I
do
look
,
which
I
would
rather
not
feel
.
<EOS>
Other
parts
of
his
face
and
head
have
their
strange
peculiarities
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
,
for
instance
,
has
a
singular
sallow
-
fairness
,
so
much
at
variance
with
the
dark
-
brown
colour
of
his
hair
,
that
I
suspect
the
hair
of
being
a
wig
,
and
his
face
,
closely
shaven
all
over
,
is
smoother
and
freer
from
all
marks
and
wrinkles
than
mine
,
though
(
according
to
Sir
Percival
's
account
of
him
)
he
is
close
on
sixty
years
of
age
.
<EOS>
But
these
are
not
the
prominent
personal
characteristics
which
distinguish
him
,
to
my
mind
,
from
all
the
other
men
I
have
ever
seen
.
<EOS>
The
marked
peculiarity
which
singles
him
out
from
the
rank
and
file
of
humanity
lies
entirely
,
so
far
as
I
can
tell
at
present
,
in
the
extraordinary
expression
and
extraordinary
power
of
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
His
manner
and
his
command
of
our
language
may
also
have
assisted
him
,
in
some
degree
,
to
establish
himself
in
my
good
opinion
.
<EOS>
He
has
that
quiet
deference
,
that
look
of
pleased
,
attentive
interest
in
listening
to
a
woman
,
and
that
secret
gentleness
in
his
voice
in
speaking
to
a
woman
,
which
,
say
what
we
may
,
we
can
none
of
us
resist
.
<EOS>
Here
,
too
,
his
unusual
command
of
the
English
language
necessarily
helps
him
.
<EOS>
I
had
often
heard
of
the
extraordinary
aptitude
which
many
Italians
show
in
mastering
our
strong
,
hard
,
Northern
speech
;
but
,
until
I
saw
Count
Fosco
,
I
had
never
supposed
it
possible
that
any
foreigner
could
have
spoken
English
as
he
speaks
it
.
<EOS>
There
are
times
when
it
is
almost
impossible
to
detect
,
by
his
accent
that
he
is
not
a
countryman
of
our
own
,
and
as
for
fluency
,
there
are
very
few
born
Englishmen
who
can
talk
with
as
few
stoppages
and
repetitions
as
the
Count
.
<EOS>
He
may
construct
his
sentences
more
or
less
in
the
foreign
way
,
but
I
have
never
yet
heard
him
use
a
wrong
expression
,
or
hesitate
for
a
moment
in
his
choice
of
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
All
the
smallest
characteristics
of
this
strange
man
have
something
strikingly
original
and
perplexingly
contradictory
in
them
.
<EOS>
Fat
as
he
is
and
old
as
he
is
,
his
movements
are
astonishingly
light
and
easy
.
<EOS>
He
is
as
noiseless
in
a
room
as
any
of
us
women
,
and
more
than
that
,
with
all
his
look
of
unmistakable
mental
firmness
and
power
,
he
is
as
nervously
sensitive
as
the
weakest
of
us
.
<EOS>
He
starts
at
chance
noises
as
inveterately
as
Laura
herself
.
<EOS>
He
winced
and
shuddered
yesterday
,
when
Sir
Percival
beat
one
of
the
spaniels
,
so
that
I
felt
ashamed
of
my
own
want
of
tenderness
and
sensibility
by
comparison
with
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
The
relation
of
this
last
incident
reminds
me
of
one
of
his
most
curious
peculiarities
,
which
I
have
not
yet
mentioned
 
his
extraordinary
fondness
for
pet
animals
.
  
<EOS>
Some
of
these
he
has
left
on
the
Continent
,
but
he
has
brought
with
him
to
this
house
a
cockatoo
,
two
canary
-
birds
,
and
a
whole
family
of
white
mice
.
<EOS>
He
attends
to
all
the
necessities
of
these
strange
favourites
himself
,
and
he
has
taught
the
creatures
to
be
surprisingly
fond
of
him
and
familiar
with
him
.
<EOS>
The
cockatoo
,
a
most
vicious
and
treacherous
bird
towards
every
one
else
,
absolutely
seems
to
love
him
.
<EOS>
When
he
lets
it
out
of
its
cage
,
it
hops
on
to
his
knee
,
and
claws
its
way
up
his
great
big
body
,
and
rubs
its
top
-
knot
against
his
sallow
double
chin
in
the
most
caressing
manner
imaginable
.
<EOS>
He
has
only
to
set
the
doors
of
the
canaries
'
cages
open
,
and
to
call
them
,
and
the
pretty
little
cleverly
trained
creatures
perch
fearlessly
on
his
hand
,
mount
his
fat
outstretched
fingers
one
by
one
,
when
he
tells
them
to
"
go
upstairs
,
"
and
sing
together
as
if
they
would
burst
their
throats
with
delight
when
they
get
to
the
top
finger
.
<EOS>
His
white
mice
live
in
a
little
pagoda
of
gaily
-
painted
wirework
,
designed
and
made
by
himself
.
<EOS>
They
are
almost
as
tame
as
the
canaries
,
and
they
are
perpetually
let
out
like
the
canaries
.
<EOS>
They
crawl
all
over
him
,
popping
in
and
out
of
his
waistcoat
,
and
sitting
in
couples
,
white
as
snow
,
on
his
capacious
shoulders
.
<EOS>
He
seems
to
be
even
fonder
of
his
mice
than
of
his
other
pets
,
smiles
at
them
,
and
kisses
them
,
and
calls
them
by
all
sorts
of
endearing
names
.
<EOS>
If
it
be
possible
to
suppose
an
Englishman
with
any
taste
for
such
childish
interests
and
amusements
as
these
,
that
Englishman
would
certainly
feel
rather
ashamed
of
them
,
and
would
be
anxious
to
apologise
for
them
,
in
the
company
of
grown
-
up
people
.
<EOS>
But
the
Count
,
apparently
,
sees
nothing
ridiculous
in
the
amazing
contrast
between
his
colossal
self
and
his
frail
little
pets
.
<EOS>
He
would
blandly
kiss
his
white
mice
and
twitter
to
his
canary
-
birds
amid
an
assembly
of
English
fox
-
hunters
,
and
would
only
pity
them
as
barbarians
when
they
were
all
laughing
their
loudest
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
seems
hardly
credible
while
I
am
writing
it
down
,
but
it
is
certainly
true
,
that
this
same
man
,
who
has
all
the
fondness
of
an
old
maid
for
his
cockatoo
,
and
all
the
small
dexterities
of
an
organ
-
boy
in
managing
his
white
mice
,
can
talk
,
when
anything
happens
to
rouse
him
,
with
a
daring
independence
of
thought
,
a
knowledge
of
books
in
every
language
,
and
an
experience
of
society
in
half
the
capitals
of
Europe
,
which
would
make
him
the
prominent
personage
of
any
assembly
in
the
civilised
world
.
<EOS>
This
trainer
of
canary
-
birds
,
this
architect
of
a
pagoda
for
white
mice
,
is
(
as
Sir
Percival
himself
has
told
me
)
one
of
the
first
experimental
chemists
living
,
and
has
discovered
,
among
other
wonderful
inventions
,
a
means
of
petrifying
the
body
after
death
,
so
as
to
preserve
it
,
as
hard
as
marble
,
to
the
end
of
time
.
<EOS>
This
fat
,
indolent
,
elderly
man
,
whose
nerves
are
so
finely
strung
that
he
starts
at
chance
noises
,
and
winces
when
he
sees
a
house
-
spaniel
get
a
whipping
,
went
into
the
stable
-
yard
on
the
morning
after
his
arrival
,
and
put
his
hand
on
the
head
of
a
chained
bloodhound
 
a
beast
<EOS>
so
savage
that
the
very
groom
who
feeds
him
keeps
out
of
his
reach
.
<EOS>
His
wife
and
I
were
present
,
and
I
shall
not
forget
the
scene
that
followed
,
short
as
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mind
that
dog
,
sir
,
"
said
the
groom
;
"
he
flies
at
everybody
!
"
<EOS>
"
He
does
that
,
my
friend
,
"
replied
the
Count
quietly
,
"
because
everybody
is
afraid
of
him
.
<EOS>
Let
us
see
if
he
flies
at
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
laid
his
plump
,
yellow
-
white
fingers
,
on
which
the
canary
-
birds
had
been
perching
ten
minutes
before
,
upon
the
formidable
brute
's
head
,
and
looked
him
straight
in
the
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
You
big
dogs
are
all
cowards
,
"
he
said
,
addressing
the
animal
contemptuously
,
with
his
face
and
the
dog
's
within
an
inch
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
kill
a
poor
cat
,
you
infernal
coward
.
<EOS>
You
would
fly
at
a
starving
beggar
,
you
infernal
coward
.
<EOS>
Anything
that
you
can
surprise
unawares
 
anything
that
is
afraid
of
your
big
body
,
and
your
wicked
white
teeth
,
and
your
slobbering
,
bloodthirsty
mouth
,
is
the
thing
you
like
to
fly
at
.
<EOS>
You
could
throttle
me
at
this
moment
,
you
mean
,
miserable
bully
,
and
you
dare
n't
so
much
as
look
me
in
the
face
,
because
I
'm
not
afraid
of
you
.
<EOS>
Will
you
think
better
of
it
,
and
try
your
teeth
in
my
fat
neck
?
<EOS>
Bah
!
<EOS>
not
you
!
"
<EOS>
He
turned
away
,
laughing
at
the
astonishment
of
the
men
in
the
yard
,
and
the
dog
crept
back
meekly
to
his
kennel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
my
nice
waistcoat
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
pathetically
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
I
came
here
.
<EOS>
Some
of
that
brute
's
slobber
has
got
on
my
pretty
clean
waistcoat
.
<EOS>
"
Those
words
express
another
of
his
incomprehensible
oddities
.
<EOS>
He
is
as
fond
of
fine
clothes
as
the
veriest
fool
in
existence
,
and
has
appeared
in
four
magnificent
waistcoats
already
 
all
of
light
garish
colours
,
and
all
immensely
large
even
for
him
 
in
the
two
days
of
his
residence
at
Blackwater
Park
.
  
<EOS>
His
tact
and
cleverness
in
small
things
are
quite
as
noticeable
as
the
singular
inconsistencies
in
his
character
,
and
the
childish
triviality
of
his
ordinary
tastes
and
pursuits
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
see
already
that
he
means
to
live
on
excellent
terms
with
all
of
us
during
the
period
of
his
sojourn
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
He
has
evidently
discovered
that
Laura
secretly
dislikes
him
(
she
confessed
as
much
to
me
when
I
pressed
her
on
the
subject
)
 
<EOS>
but
he
has
also
found
out
that
she
is
extravagantly
fond
of
flowers
.
<EOS>
Whenever
she
wants
a
nosegay
he
has
got
one
to
give
her
,
gathered
and
arranged
by
himself
,
and
greatly
to
my
amusement
,
he
is
always
cunningly
provided
with
a
duplicate
,
composed
of
exactly
the
same
flowers
,
grouped
in
exactly
the
same
way
,
to
appease
his
icily
jealous
wife
before
she
can
so
much
as
think
herself
aggrieved
.
<EOS>
His
management
of
the
Countess
(
in
public
)
is
a
sight
to
see
.
<EOS>
He
bows
to
her
,
he
habitually
addresses
her
as
"
my
angel
,
"
he
carries
his
canaries
to
pay
her
little
visits
on
his
fingers
and
to
sing
to
her
,
he
kisses
her
hand
when
she
gives
him
his
cigarettes
;
he
presents
her
with
sugar
-
plums
in
return
,
which
he
puts
into
her
mouth
playfully
,
from
a
box
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
The
rod
of
iron
with
which
he
rules
her
never
appears
in
company
 
<EOS>
it
is
a
private
rod
,
and
is
always
kept
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
His
method
of
recommending
himself
to
me
is
entirely
different
.
<EOS>
He
flatters
my
vanity
by
talking
to
me
as
seriously
and
sensibly
as
if
I
was
a
man
.
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
I
can
find
him
out
when
I
am
away
from
him
 
<EOS>
I
know
he
flatters
my
vanity
,
<EOS>
when
I
think
of
him
up
here
in
my
own
room
 
and
yet
,
when
I
go
downstairs
,
and
get
into
his
company
again
,
he
will
blind
me
again
,
and
I
shall
be
flattered
again
,
just
as
if
I
had
never
found
him
out
at
all
!
<EOS>
He
can
manage
me
as
he
manages
his
wife
and
Laura
,
as
he
managed
the
bloodhound
in
the
stable
-
yard
,
as
he
manages
Sir
Percival
himself
,
every
hour
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
good
Percival
!
<EOS>
how
I
like
your
rough
English
humour
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
good
Percival
!
<EOS>
how
I
enjoy
your
solid
English
sense
!
"
<EOS>
He
puts
the
rudest
remarks
Sir
Percival
can
make
on
his
effeminate
tastes
and
amusements
quietly
away
from
him
in
that
manner
 
always
calling
the
baronet
by
his
Christian
name
,
smiling
at
him
with
the
calmest
superiority
,
patting
him
on
the
shoulder
,
and
bearing
with
him
benignantly
,
as
a
good
-
humoured
father
bears
with
a
wayward
son
.
  
<EOS>
The
interest
which
I
really
can
not
help
feeling
in
this
strangely
original
man
has
led
me
to
question
Sir
Percival
about
his
past
life
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
either
knows
little
,
or
will
tell
me
little
,
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
and
the
Count
first
met
many
years
ago
,
at
Rome
,
under
the
dangerous
circumstances
to
which
I
have
alluded
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
Since
that
time
they
have
been
perpetually
together
in
London
,
in
Paris
,
and
in
Vienna
 
but
never
in
Italy
again
;
the
Count
having
,
oddly
enough
,
not
crossed
the
frontiers
of
his
native
country
for
years
past
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
has
been
made
the
victim
of
some
political
persecution
?
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
he
seems
to
be
patriotically
anxious
not
to
lose
sight
of
any
of
his
own
countrymen
who
may
happen
to
be
in
England
.
<EOS>
On
the
evening
of
his
arrival
he
asked
how
far
we
were
from
the
nearest
town
,
and
whether
we
knew
of
any
Italian
gentlemen
who
might
happen
to
be
settled
there
.
<EOS>
He
is
certainly
in
correspondence
with
people
on
the
Continent
,
for
his
letters
have
all
sorts
of
odd
stamps
on
them
,
and
I
saw
one
for
him
this
morning
,
waiting
in
his
place
at
the
breakfast
-
table
,
with
a
huge
,
official
-
looking
seal
on
it
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
is
in
correspondence
with
his
government
?
<EOS>
And
yet
,
that
is
hardly
to
be
reconciled
either
with
my
other
idea
that
he
may
be
a
political
exile
.
  
<EOS>
How
much
I
seem
to
have
written
about
Count
Fosco
!
<EOS>
And
what
does
it
all
amount
to
?
 
<EOS>
as
poor
,
dear
Mr.
Gilmore
would
ask
,
in
his
impenetrable
business
-
like
way
I
can
only
repeat
that
I
do
assuredly
feel
,
even
on
this
short
acquaintance
,
a
strange
,
half
-
willing
,
half
-
unwilling
liking
for
the
Count
.
<EOS>
He
seems
to
have
established
over
me
the
same
sort
of
ascendency
which
he
has
evidently
gained
over
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
Free
,
and
even
rude
,
as
he
may
occasionally
be
in
his
manner
towards
his
fat
friend
,
Sir
Percival
is
nevertheless
afraid
,
as
I
can
plainly
see
,
of
giving
any
serious
offence
to
the
Count
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
I
am
afraid
too
?
<EOS>
I
certainly
never
saw
a
man
,
in
all
my
experience
,
whom
I
should
be
so
sorry
to
have
for
an
enemy
.
<EOS>
Is
this
because
I
like
him
,
or
because
I
am
afraid
of
him
?
<EOS>
Chi
sa
?
 
<EOS>
as
Count
Fosco
might
say
in
his
own
language
.
<EOS>
Who
knows
?
  
<EOS>
June
16th
.
 
<EOS>
Something
to
chronicle
to
-
day
besides
my
own
ideas
and
impressions
.
<EOS>
A
visitor
has
arrived
 
quite
unknown
to
Laura
and
to
me
,
and
apparently
quite
unexpected
by
Sir
Percival
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
all
at
lunch
,
in
the
room
with
the
new
French
windows
that
open
into
the
verandah
,
and
the
Count
(
who
devours
pastry
as
I
have
never
yet
seen
it
devoured
by
any
human
beings
but
girls
at
boarding
-
schools
)
had
just
amused
us
by
asking
gravely
for
his
fourth
tart
 
when
the
servant
entered
to
announce
the
visitor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Merriman
has
just
come
,
Sir
Percival
,
and
wishes
to
see
you
immediately
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
started
,
and
looked
at
the
man
with
an
expression
of
angry
alarm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Merriman
!
"
<EOS>
he
repeated
,
as
if
he
thought
his
own
ears
must
have
deceived
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Sir
Percival
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Merriman
,
from
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
library
,
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
left
the
table
the
instant
the
last
answer
was
given
,
and
hurried
out
of
the
room
without
saying
a
word
to
any
of
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
Mr.
Merriman
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Laura
,
appealing
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
least
idea
,
"
was
all
I
could
say
in
reply
.
  
<EOS>
The
Count
had
finished
his
fourth
tart
,
and
had
gone
to
a
side
-
table
to
look
after
his
vicious
cockatoo
.
<EOS>
He
turned
round
to
us
with
the
bird
perched
on
his
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Merriman
is
Sir
Percival
's
solicitor
,
"
he
said
quietly
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
's
solicitor
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
perfectly
straightforward
answer
to
Laura
's
question
,
and
yet
,
under
the
circumstances
,
it
was
not
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Merriman
had
been
specially
sent
for
by
his
client
,
there
would
have
been
nothing
very
wonderful
in
his
leaving
town
to
obey
the
summons
.
<EOS>
But
when
a
lawyer
travels
from
London
to
Hampshire
without
being
sent
for
,
and
when
his
arrival
at
a
gentleman
's
house
seriously
startles
the
gentleman
himself
,
it
may
be
safely
taken
for
granted
that
the
legal
visitor
is
the
bearer
of
some
very
important
and
very
unexpected
news
 
news
which
may
be
either
very
good
or
very
bad
,
but
which
can
not
,
in
either
case
,
be
of
the
common
everyday
kind
.
  
<EOS>
Laura
and
I
sat
silent
at
the
table
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
more
,
wondering
uneasily
what
had
happened
,
and
waiting
for
the
chance
of
Sir
Percival
's
speedy
return
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
signs
of
his
return
,
and
we
rose
to
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
Count
,
attentive
as
usual
,
advanced
from
the
corner
in
which
he
had
been
feeding
his
cockatoo
,
with
the
bird
still
perched
on
his
shoulder
,
and
opened
the
door
for
us
.
<EOS>
Laura
and
Madame
Fosco
went
out
first
.
<EOS>
Just
as
I
was
on
the
point
of
following
them
he
made
a
sign
with
his
hand
,
and
spoke
to
me
,
before
I
passed
him
,
in
the
oddest
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
said
,
quietly
answering
the
unexpressed
idea
at
that
moment
in
my
mind
,
as
if
I
had
plainly
confided
it
to
him
in
so
many
words
 
"
yes
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
something
HAS
happened
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
on
the
point
of
answering
,
"
<EOS>
I
never
said
so
,
"
but
the
vicious
cockatoo
ruffled
his
clipped
wings
and
gave
a
screech
that
set
all
my
nerves
on
edge
in
an
instant
,
and
made
me
only
too
glad
to
get
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
joined
Laura
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
The
thought
in
her
mind
was
the
same
as
the
thought
in
mine
,
which
Count
Fosco
had
surprised
,
and
when
she
spoke
her
words
were
almost
the
echo
of
his
.
<EOS>
She
,
too
,
said
to
me
secretly
that
she
was
afraid
something
had
happened
.
    
<EOS>
June
16th
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
few
lines
more
to
add
to
this
day
's
entry
before
I
go
to
bed
to
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
About
two
hours
after
Sir
Percival
rose
from
the
luncheon
-
table
to
receive
his
solicitor
,
Mr.
Merriman
,
in
the
library
,
I
left
my
room
alone
to
take
a
walk
in
the
plantations
.
<EOS>
Just
as
I
was
at
the
end
of
the
landing
the
library
door
opened
and
the
two
gentlemen
came
out
.
<EOS>
Thinking
it
best
not
to
disturb
them
by
appearing
on
the
stairs
,
I
resolved
to
defer
going
down
till
they
had
crossed
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Although
they
spoke
to
each
other
in
guarded
tones
,
their
words
were
pronounced
with
sufficient
distinctness
of
utterance
to
reach
my
ears
.
  
<EOS>
"
Make
your
mind
easy
,
Sir
Percival
,
"
I
heard
the
lawyer
say
;
"
it
all
rests
with
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
turned
to
go
back
to
my
own
room
for
a
minute
or
two
,
but
the
sound
of
Laura
's
name
on
the
lips
of
a
stranger
stopped
me
instantly
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
it
was
very
wrong
and
very
discreditable
to
listen
,
but
where
is
the
woman
,
in
the
whole
range
of
our
sex
,
who
can
regulate
her
actions
by
the
abstract
principles
of
honour
,
when
those
principles
point
one
way
,
and
when
her
affections
,
and
the
interests
which
grow
out
of
them
,
point
the
other
?
  
<EOS>
I
listened
 
and
under
similar
circumstances
I
would
listen
again
 
yes
!
<EOS>
with
my
ear
at
the
keyhole
,
if
I
could
not
possibly
manage
it
in
any
other
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
quite
understand
,
Sir
Percival
,
"
the
lawyer
went
on
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
is
to
sign
her
name
in
the
presence
of
a
witness
 
or
of
two
witnesses
,
if
you
wish
to
be
particularly
careful
 
and
is
then
to
put
her
finger
on
the
seal
and
say
,
"
I
deliver
this
as
my
act
and
deed
.
<EOS>
"
If
that
is
done
in
a
week
's
time
the
arrangement
will
be
perfectly
successful
,
and
the
anxiety
will
be
all
over
.
<EOS>
If
not
 
"
  
"
What
do
you
mean
by
"
if
not
'
?
"
asked
Sir
Percival
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
If
the
thing
must
be
done
it
SHALL
be
done
.
<EOS>
I
promise
you
that
,
Merriman
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Just
so
,
Sir
Percival
 
<EOS>
just
so
;
but
there
are
two
alternatives
in
all
transactions
,
and
we
lawyers
like
to
look
both
of
them
in
the
face
boldly
.
<EOS>
If
through
any
extraordinary
circumstance
the
arrangement
should
not
be
made
,
I
think
I
may
be
able
to
get
the
parties
to
accept
bills
at
three
months
.
<EOS>
But
how
the
money
is
to
be
raised
when
the
bills
fall
due
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Damn
the
bills
!
<EOS>
The
money
is
only
to
be
got
in
one
way
,
and
in
that
way
,
I
tell
you
again
,
it
SHALL
be
got
.
<EOS>
Take
a
glass
of
wine
,
Merriman
,
before
you
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Much
obliged
,
Sir
Percival
,
I
have
not
a
moment
to
lose
if
I
am
to
catch
the
up
-
train
.
<EOS>
You
will
let
me
know
as
soon
as
the
arrangement
is
complete
?
<EOS>
and
you
will
not
forget
the
caution
I
recommended
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
There
's
the
dog
-
cart
at
the
door
for
you
.
<EOS>
My
groom
will
get
you
to
the
station
in
no
time
.
<EOS>
Benjamin
,
drive
like
mad
!
<EOS>
Jump
in
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Merriman
misses
the
train
you
lose
your
place
.
<EOS>
Hold
fast
,
Merriman
,
and
if
you
are
upset
trust
to
the
devil
to
save
his
own
.
"
<EOS>
With
that
parting
benediction
the
baronet
turned
about
and
walked
back
to
the
library
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
not
heard
much
,
but
the
little
that
had
reached
my
ears
was
enough
to
make
me
feel
uneasy
.
<EOS>
The
"
something
"
that
"
had
happened
"
was
but
too
plainly
a
serious
money
embarrassment
,
and
Sir
Percival
's
relief
from
it
depended
upon
Laura
.
<EOS>
The
prospect
of
seeing
her
involved
in
her
husband
's
secret
difficulties
filled
me
with
dismay
,
exaggerated
,
no
doubt
,
by
my
ignorance
of
business
and
my
settled
distrust
of
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
going
out
,
as
I
proposed
,
I
went
back
immediately
to
Laura
's
room
to
tell
her
what
I
had
heard
.
  
<EOS>
She
received
my
bad
news
so
composedly
as
to
surprise
me
.
<EOS>
She
evidently
knows
more
of
her
husband
's
character
and
her
husband
's
embarrassments
than
I
have
suspected
up
to
this
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
feared
as
much
,
"
she
said
,
"
when
I
heard
of
that
strange
gentleman
who
called
,
and
declined
to
leave
his
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
do
you
think
the
gentleman
was
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Some
person
who
has
heavy
claims
on
Sir
Percival
,
"
she
answered
,
"
and
who
has
been
the
cause
of
Mr.
Merriman
's
visit
here
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
anything
about
those
claims
?
"
  
"
No
,
I
know
no
particulars
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
sign
nothing
,
Laura
,
without
first
looking
at
it
?
"
  
"
Certainly
not
,
Marian
.
<EOS>
Whatever
I
can
harmlessly
and
honestly
do
to
help
him
I
will
do
 
for
the
sake
of
making
your
life
and
mine
,
love
,
as
easy
and
as
happy
as
possible
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
do
nothing
ignorantly
,
which
we
might
,
one
day
,
have
reason
to
feel
ashamed
of
.
<EOS>
Let
us
say
no
more
about
it
now
.
<EOS>
You
have
got
your
hat
on
 
<EOS>
suppose
we
go
and
dream
away
the
afternoon
in
the
grounds
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
On
leaving
the
house
we
directed
our
steps
to
the
nearest
shade
.
  
<EOS>
As
we
passed
an
open
space
among
the
trees
in
front
of
the
house
,
there
was
Count
Fosco
,
slowly
walking
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
grass
,
sunning
himself
in
the
full
blaze
of
the
hot
June
afternoon
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
broad
straw
hat
on
,
with
a
violet
-
coloured
ribbon
round
it
.
<EOS>
A
blue
blouse
,
with
profuse
white
fancy
-
work
over
the
bosom
,
covered
his
prodigious
body
,
and
was
girt
about
the
place
where
his
waist
might
once
have
been
with
a
broad
scarlet
leather
belt
.
<EOS>
Nankeen
trousers
,
displaying
more
white
fancy
-
work
over
the
ankles
,
and
purple
morocco
slippers
,
adorned
his
lower
extremities
.
<EOS>
He
was
singing
Figaro
's
famous
song
in
the
Barber
of
Seville
,
with
that
crisply
fluent
vocalisation
which
is
never
heard
from
any
other
than
an
Italian
throat
,
accompanying
himself
on
the
concertina
,
which
he
played
with
ecstatic
throwings
-
up
of
his
arms
,
and
graceful
twistings
and
turnings
of
his
head
,
like
a
fat
St.
Cecilia
masquerading
in
male
attire
.
"

<EOS>
sang
the
Count
,
jauntily
tossing
up
the
concertina
at
arm
's
length
,
and
bowing
to
us
,
on
one
side
of
the
instrument
,
with
the
airy
grace
and
elegance
of
Figaro
himself
at
twenty
years
of
age
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
my
word
for
it
,
Laura
,
that
man
knows
something
of
Sir
Percival
's
embarrassments
,
"
I
said
,
as
we
returned
the
Count
's
salutation
from
a
safe
distance
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
makes
you
think
that
?
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
should
he
have
known
,
otherwise
,
that
Mr.
Merriman
was
Sir
Percival
's
solicitor
?
<EOS>
"
I
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Besides
,
when
I
followed
you
out
of
the
luncheon
-
room
,
he
told
me
,
without
a
single
word
of
inquiry
on
my
part
,
that
something
had
happened
.
<EOS>
Depend
upon
it
,
he
knows
more
than
we
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
ask
him
any
questions
if
he
does
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
take
him
into
our
confidence
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
dislike
him
,
Laura
,
in
a
very
determined
manner
.
<EOS>
What
has
he
said
or
done
to
justify
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nothing
,
Marian
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
he
was
all
kindness
and
attention
on
our
journey
home
,
and
he
several
times
checked
Sir
Percival
's
outbreaks
of
temper
,
in
the
most
considerate
manner
towards
me
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
dislike
him
because
he
has
so
much
more
power
over
my
husband
than
I
have
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
hurts
my
pride
to
be
under
any
obligations
to
his
interference
.
<EOS>
All
I
know
is
,
that
I
DO
dislike
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
day
and
evening
passed
quietly
enough
.
<EOS>
The
Count
and
I
played
at
chess
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
two
games
he
politely
allowed
me
to
conquer
him
,
and
then
,
when
he
saw
that
I
had
found
him
out
,
begged
my
pardon
,
and
at
the
third
game
checkmated
me
in
ten
minutes
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
never
once
referred
,
all
through
the
evening
,
to
the
lawyer
's
visit
.
<EOS>
But
either
that
event
,
or
something
else
,
had
produced
a
singular
alteration
for
the
better
in
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
as
polite
and
agreeable
to
all
of
us
,
as
he
used
to
be
in
the
days
of
his
probation
at
Limmeridge
,
and
he
was
so
amazingly
attentive
and
kind
to
his
wife
,
that
even
icy
Madame
Fosco
was
roused
into
looking
at
him
with
a
grave
surprise
.
<EOS>
What
does
this
mean
?
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
guess
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
Laura
can
guess
 
<EOS>
and
I
am
sure
Count
Fosco
knows
.
<EOS>
I
caught
Sir
Percival
looking
at
him
for
approval
more
than
once
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
June
17th
.
 
<EOS>
A
day
of
events
.
<EOS>
I
most
fervently
hope
I
may
not
have
to
add
,
a
day
of
disasters
as
well
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
was
as
silent
at
breakfast
as
he
had
been
the
evening
before
,
on
the
subject
of
the
mysterious
"
arrangement
"
(
as
the
lawyer
called
it
)
which
is
hanging
over
our
heads
.
<EOS>
An
hour
afterwards
,
however
,
he
suddenly
entered
the
morning
-
room
,
where
his
wife
and
I
were
waiting
,
with
our
hats
on
,
for
Madame
Fosco
to
join
us
,
and
inquired
for
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
expect
to
see
him
here
directly
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
"
Sir
Percival
went
on
,
walking
nervously
about
the
room
,
"
I
want
Fosco
and
his
wife
in
the
library
,
for
a
mere
business
formality
,
and
I
want
you
there
,
Laura
,
for
a
minute
too
.
"
<EOS>
He
stopped
,
and
appeared
to
notice
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
we
were
in
our
walking
costume
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
just
come
in
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
"
or
were
you
just
going
out
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
were
all
thinking
of
going
to
the
lake
this
morning
,
"
said
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
have
any
other
arrangement
to
propose
 
"
  
"
No
,
no
,
"
he
answered
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
My
arrangement
can
wait
.
<EOS>
After
lunch
will
do
as
well
for
it
as
after
breakfast
.
<EOS>
All
going
to
the
lake
,
eh
?
<EOS>
A
good
idea
.
<EOS>
Let
's
have
an
idle
morning
 
<EOS>
I
'll
be
one
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
mistaking
his
manner
,
even
if
it
had
been
possible
to
mistake
the
uncharacteristic
readiness
which
his
words
expressed
,
to
submit
his
own
plans
and
projects
to
the
convenience
of
others
.
<EOS>
He
was
evidently
relieved
at
finding
any
excuse
for
delaying
the
business
formality
in
the
library
,
to
which
his
own
words
had
referred
.
<EOS>
My
heart
sank
within
me
as
I
drew
the
inevitable
inference
.
  
<EOS>
The
Count
and
his
wife
joined
us
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
The
lady
had
her
husband
's
embroidered
tobacco
-
pouch
,
and
her
store
of
paper
in
her
hand
,
for
the
manufacture
of
the
eternal
cigarettes
.
<EOS>
The
gentleman
,
dressed
,
as
usual
,
in
his
blouse
and
straw
hat
,
carried
the
gay
little
pagoda
-
cage
,
with
his
darling
white
mice
in
it
,
and
smiled
on
them
,
and
on
us
,
with
a
bland
amiability
which
it
was
impossible
to
resist
.
  
<EOS>
"
With
your
kind
permission
,
"
said
the
Count
,
"
I
will
take
my
small
family
here
 
my
poor
-
little
-
harmless
-
pretty
-
Mouseys
,
out
for
an
airing
along
with
us
.
<EOS>
There
are
dogs
about
the
house
,
and
shall
I
leave
my
forlorn
white
children
at
the
mercies
of
the
dogs
?
<EOS>
Ah
,
never
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
chirruped
paternally
at
his
small
white
children
through
the
bars
of
the
pagoda
,
and
we
all
left
the
house
for
the
lake
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
plantation
Sir
Percival
strayed
away
from
us
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
be
part
of
his
restless
disposition
always
to
separate
himself
from
his
companions
on
these
occasions
,
and
always
to
occupy
himself
when
he
is
alone
in
cutting
new
walking
-
sticks
for
his
own
use
.
<EOS>
The
mere
act
of
cutting
and
lopping
at
hazard
appears
to
please
him
.
<EOS>
He
has
filled
the
house
with
walking
-
sticks
of
his
own
making
,
not
one
of
which
he
ever
takes
up
for
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
When
they
have
been
once
used
his
interest
in
them
is
all
exhausted
,
and
he
thinks
of
nothing
but
going
on
and
making
more
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
old
boat
-
house
he
joined
us
again
.
<EOS>
I
will
put
down
the
conversation
that
ensued
when
we
were
all
settled
in
our
places
exactly
as
it
passed
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
important
conversation
,
so
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
for
it
has
seriously
disposed
me
to
distrust
the
influence
which
Count
Fosco
has
exercised
over
my
thoughts
and
feelings
,
and
to
resist
it
for
the
future
as
resolutely
as
I
can
.
  
<EOS>
The
boat
-
house
was
large
enough
to
hold
us
all
,
but
Sir
Percival
remained
outside
trimming
the
last
new
stick
with
his
pocket
-
axe
.
<EOS>
We
three
women
found
plenty
of
room
on
the
large
seat
.
<EOS>
Laura
took
her
work
,
and
Madame
Fosco
began
her
cigarettes
.
<EOS>
I
,
as
usual
,
had
nothing
to
do
.
<EOS>
My
hands
always
were
,
and
always
will
be
,
as
awkward
as
a
man
's
.
<EOS>
The
Count
good
-
humouredly
took
a
stool
<EOS>
many
sizes
too
small
for
him
,
and
balanced
himself
on
it
with
his
back
against
the
side
of
the
shed
,
which
creaked
and
groaned
under
his
weight
.
<EOS>
He
put
the
pagoda
-
cage
on
his
lap
,
and
let
out
the
mice
to
crawl
over
him
as
usual
.
<EOS>
They
are
pretty
,
innocent
-
looking
little
creatures
,
but
the
sight
of
them
creeping
about
a
man
's
body
is
for
some
reason
not
pleasant
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
excites
a
strange
responsive
creeping
in
my
own
nerves
,
and
suggests
hideous
ideas
of
men
dying
in
prison
with
the
crawling
creatures
of
the
dungeon
preying
on
them
undisturbed
.
  
<EOS>
The
morning
was
windy
and
cloudy
,
and
the
rapid
alternations
of
shadow
and
sunlight
over
the
waste
of
the
lake
made
the
view
look
doubly
wild
,
weird
,
and
gloomy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Some
people
call
that
picturesque
,
"
said
Sir
Percival
,
pointing
over
the
wide
prospect
with
his
half
-
finished
walking
-
stick
.
<EOS>
"
I
call
it
a
blot
on
a
gentleman
's
property
.
<EOS>
In
my
great
-
grandfather
's
time
the
lake
flowed
to
this
place
.
<EOS>
Look
at
it
now
!
<EOS>
It
is
not
four
feet
deep
anywhere
,
and
it
is
all
puddles
and
pools
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
afford
to
drain
it
,
and
plant
it
all
over
.
<EOS>
My
bailiff
(
a
superstitious
idiot
)
says
he
is
quite
sure
the
lake
has
a
curse
on
it
,
like
the
Dead
Sea
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
,
Fosco
?
<EOS>
It
looks
just
the
place
for
a
murder
,
does
n't
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
good
Percival
,
"
remonstrated
the
Count
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
solid
English
sense
thinking
of
?
<EOS>
The
water
is
too
shallow
to
hide
the
body
,
and
there
is
sand
everywhere
to
print
off
the
murderer
's
footsteps
.
<EOS>
It
is
,
upon
the
whole
,
the
very
worst
place
for
a
murder
that
I
ever
set
my
eyes
on
.
"
  
"
Humbug
!
"
said
Sir
Percival
,
cutting
away
fiercely
at
his
stick
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
The
dreary
scenery
,
the
lonely
situation
.
<EOS>
If
you
choose
to
understand
me
,
you
can
 
if
you
do
n't
choose
,
I
am
not
going
to
trouble
myself
to
explain
my
meaning
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
why
not
,
"
asked
the
Count
,
"
when
your
meaning
can
be
explained
by
anybody
in
two
words
?
<EOS>
If
a
fool
was
going
to
commit
a
murder
,
your
lake
is
the
first
place
he
would
choose
for
it
.
<EOS>
If
a
wise
man
was
going
to
commit
a
murder
,
your
lake
is
the
last
place
he
would
choose
for
it
.
<EOS>
Is
that
your
meaning
?
<EOS>
If
it
is
,
there
is
your
explanation
for
you
ready
made
.
<EOS>
Take
it
,
Percival
,
with
your
good
Fosco
's
blessing
.
"
  
<EOS>
Laura
looked
at
the
Count
with
her
dislike
for
him
appearing
a
little
too
plainly
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
busy
with
his
mice
that
he
did
not
notice
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
hear
the
lake
-
view
connected
with
anything
so
horrible
as
the
idea
of
murder
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
if
Count
Fosco
must
divide
murderers
into
classes
,
I
think
he
has
been
very
unfortunate
in
his
choice
of
expressions
.
<EOS>
To
describe
them
as
fools
only
seems
like
treating
them
with
an
indulgence
to
which
they
have
no
claim
.
<EOS>
And
to
describe
them
as
wise
men
sounds
to
me
like
a
downright
contradiction
in
terms
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
heard
that
truly
wise
men
are
truly
good
men
,
and
have
a
horror
of
crime
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
lady
,
"
said
the
Count
,
"
those
are
admirable
sentiments
,
and
I
have
seen
them
stated
at
the
tops
of
copy
-
books
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
lifted
one
of
the
white
mice
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
,
and
spoke
to
it
in
his
whimsical
way
.
<EOS>
"
My
pretty
little
smooth
white
rascal
,
"
he
said
,
"
here
is
a
moral
lesson
for
you
.
<EOS>
A
truly
wise
mouse
is
a
truly
good
mouse
.
<EOS>
Mention
that
,
if
you
please
,
to
your
companions
,
and
never
gnaw
at
the
bars
of
your
cage
again
as
long
as
you
live
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
easy
to
turn
everything
into
ridicule
,
"
said
Laura
resolutely
;
"
but
you
will
not
find
it
quite
so
easy
,
Count
Fosco
,
to
give
me
an
instance
of
a
wise
man
who
has
been
a
great
criminal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
Count
shrugged
his
huge
shoulders
,
and
smiled
on
Laura
in
the
friendliest
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Most
true
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
The
fool
's
crime
is
the
crime
that
is
found
out
,
and
the
wise
man
's
crime
is
the
crime
that
is
NOT
found
out
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
give
you
an
instance
,
it
would
not
be
the
instance
of
a
wise
man
.
<EOS>
Dear
Lady
Glyde
,
your
sound
English
common
sense
has
been
too
much
for
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
checkmate
for
me
this
time
,
Miss
Halcombe
 
ha
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stand
to
your
guns
,
Laura
,
"
sneered
Sir
Percival
,
who
had
been
listening
in
his
place
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
next
,
that
crimes
cause
their
own
detection
.
<EOS>
There
's
another
bit
of
copy
-
book
morality
for
you
,
Fosco
.
<EOS>
Crimes
cause
their
own
detection
.
<EOS>
What
infernal
humbug
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
to
be
true
,
"
said
Laura
quietly
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
burst
out
laughing
,
so
violently
,
so
outrageously
,
that
he
quite
startled
us
all
 
the
Count
more
than
any
of
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
too
,
"
I
said
,
coming
to
Laura
's
rescue
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
,
who
had
been
unaccountably
amused
at
his
wife
's
remark
,
was
just
as
unaccountably
irritated
by
mine
.
<EOS>
He
struck
the
new
stick
savagely
on
the
sand
,
and
walked
away
from
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
dear
Percival
!
"
cried
Count
Fosco
,
looking
after
him
gaily
,
"
he
is
the
victim
of
English
spleen
.
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
Miss
Halcombe
,
my
dear
Lady
Glyde
,
do
you
really
believe
that
crimes
cause
their
own
detection

And
you

my

"
he
continued
,
turning
to
his
wife
,
who
had
not
uttered
a
word
yet
,
"
do
you
think
so
too
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wait
to
be
instructed

replied
the
Countess
,
in
tones
of
freezing
reproof
,
intended
for
Laura
and
me
,
"
before
I
venture
on
giving
my
opinion
in
the
presence
of
well
-
informed
men
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
,
indeed
?
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
remember
the
time
,
Countess
,
when
you
advocated
the
Rights
of
Women
,
and
freedom
of
female
opinion
was
one
of
them

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
What
is
your
view
of
the
subject
,
Count
?
"
asked
Madame
Fosco
,
calmly
proceeding
with
her
cigarettes
,
and
not
taking
the
least
notice
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
The
Count
stroked
one
of
his
white
mice
reflectively
with
his
chubby
little
finger
before
he
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
truly
wonderful
,
"
he
said
,
"
how
easily
Society
can
console
itself
for
the
worst
of
its
shortcomings
with
a
little
bit
of
clap
-
trap

<EOS>
The
machinery
it
has
set
up
for
the
detection
of
crime
is
miserably
ineffective
 
and
yet
only
invent
a
moral
epigram
,
saying
that
it
works
well
,
and
you
blind
everybody
to
its
blunders
from
that
moment
.
<EOS>
Crimes
cause
their
own
detection
,
do
they
?
<EOS>
And
murder
will
out
(
another
moral
epigram
)
<EOS>
,
will
it
?
<EOS>
Ask
Coroners
who
sit
at
inquests

<EOS>
what
conclusion
do
you
come

<EOS>
This
.
<EOS>
That
there
are
foolish
criminals

discovered

wise
criminals

escape

<EOS>
The
hiding
of
a
crime
,
or
the
detection
of
a
crime
<EOS>
,
what
is
it
?
<EOS>
A
trial
of
skill
between
the
police
on
one
side
,
and
the
individual
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
When
the
criminal
is
a
brutal

ignorant
fool

the
police
in
nine
cases

When

highly

intelligent
man

the

If

If

And
on
this

that
Crime

<EOS>
Yes
 
all

And
what

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Devilish
true
,
and
very
well
put

"
cried
a
voice
at
the
entrance
of
the
boat
-
house
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
had
recovered
his
equanimity
,
and
had
come
back
while
we
were
listening
to
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
"
Some
of
it
may
be
true
,
"
I
said
,
"
and
all
of
it
may
be
very
well
put
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
see
why
Count
Fosco
should
celebrate
the
victory
of
the
criminal
over
Society
with
so
much
exultation
,
or
why
you
,
Sir
Percival
,
should
applaud
him
so
loudly
for
doing
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hear
that
,
Fosco
?
"
asked
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
"
Take
my
advice

make
your
peace

<EOS>
Tell

virtue
's
a

<EOS>
they
like

<EOS>

I

"
  
<EOS>
The
Count
laughed
inwardly
and
silently
,
and
two
of
the
white
mice
in
his
waistcoat
,
alarmed
by
the
internal
convulsion
going
on
beneath
them
,
darted
out
in
a
violent
hurry
,
and
scrambled
into
their
cage
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
ladies
,
my
good
Percival
,
shall
tell
me
about
virtue
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
better
authorities
than
I
am

for
they
know
what
virtue
is

and
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
hear
him

"
said
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
it
awful
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
true

"
said
the
Count
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
citizen
of
the
world
,
and
I
have
met
,
in
my
time
,
with
so
many
different
sorts
of
virtue
,
that
I
am
puzzled
,
in
my
old
age
,
to
say
which
is
the
right
sort
and
which
is
the
wrong
.
<EOS>
Here
,
in
England
,
there
is
one
virtue
.
<EOS>
And
there
,
in
China
,
there
is
another
virtue
.
<EOS>
And
John
Englishman
says
my
virtue
is
the
genuine
virtue
.
<EOS>
And
John
Chinaman
says
my
virtue
is
the
genuine
virtue
.
<EOS>
And
I
say
Yes
to
one
,
or
No
to
the
other
,
and
am
just
as
much
bewildered
about
it
in
the
case
of
John
with
the
top

boots
as
I
am
in
the
case
of
John
with
the
pigtail

Ah

nice
little
Mousey

<EOS>
come

<EOS>
What
is
your
own
private
notion
of
a
virtuous
man

my
pret

pret

pretty
?
<EOS>
A
man
who
keeps
you
warm
,
and
gives
you
plenty
to
eat
.
<EOS>
And
a
good
notion
,
too

for
it
is
intelligible
,
at
the

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stay
a
minute
,
Count
,
"
I
interposed
.
<EOS>
"
Accepting
your
illustration
,
surely
we
have
one
unquestionable
virtue
in
England
which
is
wanting
in
China
.
<EOS>
The
Chinese
authorities
kill
thousands
of
innocent
people
on
the
most
frivolous
pretexts
.
<EOS>
We
in
England
are
free
from
all
guilt
of
that
kind
 
<EOS>
we
commit
no
such
dreadful
crime
 
<EOS>
we
abhor
<EOS>
reckless
bloodshed

all
our
hearts

<EOS>
"
  
"
Quite

Marian

said
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well

well

"
Pray
allow
the
Count
to
proceed

"
said
Madame
Fosco
,
with
stern
civility
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
find

young

"
Thank

replied
the
Count
.
"
<EOS>
Have

bon

<EOS>
He
took
out
of
his
pocket
a
pretty
little
inlaid
box
,
and
placed
it
open
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
Chocolat

Vanille

"
cried
the
impenetrable
man
,
cheerfully
rattling
the
sweetmeats
in
the
box
,
and
bowing
all
round
.
"
<EOS>
Offered
by
Fosco
as
an
act
of
homage
to
the
charming
society
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Be
good

go
on

said
his
wife
,
with
a
spiteful
reference
to
myself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oblige
me
by
answering
Miss
Halcombe

<EOS>
"
  
"
Miss
Halcombe
is
unanswerable

replied
the
polite
Italian
;
"
that
is
to
say
,
so
far

she
goes

<EOS>
Yes

<EOS>
John
Bull
does
abhor
the
crimes

John
Chinaman

<EOS>
He
is
the
quickest
old

<EOS>
Is
he
so

<EOS>
English
Society

Miss

as
often
the
accomplice

it
is
the
enemy

<EOS>
Yes

<EOS>
yes

Crime
is
in
this

what
crime
is
in
other
countries
 
a
good
friend
to
a

to
those
about
him
as
often
as
it
is
an
enemy

<EOS>
A
great
rascal
provides
for
his
wife

family
.
<EOS>
The
worse
he
is
the
more
he
makes
them
the
objects
for
your
sympathy
.
<EOS>
He
often
provides
also
for
himself
.
<EOS>
A
profligate
spendthrift
who
is
always
borrowing
money
will
get
more
from
his
friends
than
the
rigidly
honest
man
who
only
borrows
of
them
once
,
under
pressure
of
the
direst
want
.
<EOS>
In
the
one
case
the
friends
will
not
be
at
all
surprised
,
and
they
will
give
.
<EOS>
In
the
other
case
they
will
be
very
much
surprised
,
and
they
will
hesitate
.
<EOS>
Is
the
prison
that
Mr.
Scoundrel
lives
in
at
the
end
of
his
career
a
more
uncomfortable
place
than
the
workhouse
that
Mr.
Honesty
lives
in
at
the
end
of
his
career
?
<EOS>
When
John

Howard

Philanthropist
wants
to
relieve
misery
he
goes
to
find
it
in
prisons
,
where
crime
is
wretched
 
not
in
huts
and
hovels
,
where
virtue
is
wretched
too

Who
is
the
English
poet
who
has
won
the
most
universal
sympathy
 
who
makes

pathetic
writing

pathetic
painting

That

ended

suicide
 
your

best

do
you
think

poor
starving
dressmakers
 
the
woman

resists
temptation

honest

or
the
woman

falls
under
temptation

steals

yourself
for
gold
to
a
man
you
do

care
for

all
your

rejoice

you

a

sanctions

accept
the

mine
is

tears
off

He
got
up

put
the

paused
for

moment
to
count
the
mice
in
it

Neither
Laura

I
were
in
any
favorable
disposition

be
amused

<EOS>
The
Count
's
glib
cynicism
had
revealed
a
new
aspect
of
his
nature
from
which
we
both
recoiled
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
impossible
to
resist
the
comical
distress
of
so
very
large
a
man
at
the
loss
of
so
very
small
a
mouse
.
<EOS>
We
laughed
in
spite
of
ourselves
;
and
when
Madame
Fosco
rose
to
set
the
example
of
leaving
the
boat
-
house
empty
,
so
that
her
husband
might
search
it
to
its
remotest
corners
,
we
rose
also
to
follow
her
out
.
  
<EOS>
Before
we
had
taken
three
steps
,
the
Count
's
quick
eye
discovered
the
lost
mouse
under
the
seat
that
we
had
been
occupying
.
<EOS>
He
pulled
aside
the
bench
,
took
the
little
animal
up
in
his
hand
,
and
then
suddenly
stopped
,
on
his
knees
,
looking
intently
at
a
particular
place
on
the
ground
just
beneath
him
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
rose
to
his
feet
again
,
his
hand
shook
so
that
he
could
hardly
put
the
mouse
back
in
the
cage
,
and
his
face
was
of
a
faint
livid
yellow
hue
all
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
Percival

"
<EOS>
he
said
,
in
a
whisper
.
"
<EOS>
Percival

<EOS>
come
here

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
had
paid
no
attention
to
any
of
us
for
the
last
ten
minutes
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
entirely
absorbed
in
writing
figures
on
the
sand
,
and
then
rubbing
them
out
again
with
the
point
of
his
stick
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
now
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
lounging
carelessly
into
the
boat
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
see
nothing
there
?
"
said
the
Count
,
catching
him
nervously
by
the
collar
with
one
hand
,
and
pointing
with
the
other
to
the
place
near
which
he
had
found
the
mouse
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
plenty
of
dry
sand

"
answered
Sir
Percival
,
"
and
a
spot
of
dirt
in
the
middle
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
dirt

whispered
the
Count
,
fastening
the
other
hand
suddenly
on
Sir
Percival
's
collar
,
and
shaking
it
in
his
agitation

hear
the
last
word
,
softly
as
he
whispered
it
.
<EOS>
She
turned
to
me
with
a
look
of
terror
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
my
dear
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
need
to
be
alarmed
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
the
blood
of
a
poor
little
stray
dog
.
"
  
<EOS>
Everybody
was
astonished
,
and
everybody
's
eyes
were
fixed
on
me
inquiringly
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
that
?
"
asked
Sir
Percival
,
speaking
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
found
the
dog
here
,
dying
,
on
the
day
when
you
all
returned
from
abroad
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
The
poor
creature
had
strayed
into
the
plantation
,
and
had
been
shot
by
your
keeper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whose
dog
was
it
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Sir
Percival
.
"
<EOS>
Not
one
of
mine
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
try
to
save
the
poor
thing
?
"
asked
Laura
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"
Surely
you
tried
to
save
it
,
Marian
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
said
,
"
the
housekeeper
and
I
both
did
our
best
 
but
the
dog
was
mortally
wounded
,
and
he
died
under
our
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whose
dog
was
it
?
<EOS>
"
persisted
Sir
Percival
,
repeating
his
question
a
little
irritably
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
One
of
mine
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
one
of
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whose
then
?
Did
the
housekeeper
know
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
housekeeper
's
report
of
Mrs.
Catherick
's
desire
to
conceal
her
visit
to
Blackwater
Park
from
Sir
Percival
's
knowledge
recurred
to
my
memory
the
moment
he
put
that
last
question
,
and
I
half
doubted
the
discretion
of
answering
it
;
but
in
my
anxiety
to
quiet
the
general
alarm
,
I
had
thoughtlessly
advanced
too
far
to
draw
back
,
except
at
the
risk
of
exciting
suspicion
,
which
might
only
make
matters
worse
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
answer
at
once
,
without
reference
to
results
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
The
housekeeper
knew
.
<EOS>
She
told
me
it
was
Mrs.
Catherick
's
dog
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
had
hitherto
remained
at
the
inner
end
of
the
boat
-
house
with
Count
Fosco
,
while
I
spoke
to
him
from
the
door
.
<EOS>
But
the
instant
Mrs.
Catherick
's
name
passed
my
lips
he
pushed
by
the
Count
roughly
,
and
placed
himself
face
to
face
with
me
under
the
open
daylight
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
came
the
housekeeper
to
know
it
was
Mrs.
Catherick
's
dog
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
fixing
his
eyes
on
mine
with
a
frowning
interest
and
attention
,
which
half
angered
,
half
startled
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
knew
it
,
"
I
said
quietly
,
"
because
Mrs.
Catherick
brought
the
dog
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Brought
it
with
her
?
<EOS>
Where
did
she
bring
it
with
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
this
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
did
Mrs.
Catherick
want
at
this
house
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
manner
in
which
he
put
the
question
was
even
more
offensive
than
the
language
in
which
he
expressed
it
.
<EOS>
I
marked
my
sense
of
his
want
of
common
politeness
by
silently
turning
away
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
Just
as
I
moved
the
Count
's
persuasive
hand
was
laid
on
his
shoulder
,
and
the
Count
's
mellifluous
voice
interposed
to
quiet
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Percival
!
 
<EOS>
gently
 
gently
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
looked
round
in
his
angriest
manner
.
<EOS>
The
Count
only
smiled
and
repeated
the
soothing
application
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gently
,
my
good
friend
 
gently
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
hesitated
,
followed
me
a
few
steps
,
and
,
to
my
great
surprise
,
offered
me
an
apology
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
out
of
order
lately
,
and
I
am
afraid
I
am
a
little
irritable
.
<EOS>
But
I
should
like
to
know
what
Mrs.
Catherick
could
possibly
want
here
.
<EOS>
When
did
she
come
?
<EOS>
Was
the
housekeeper
the
only
person
who
saw
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
only
person
,
"
I
answered
,
"
so
far
as
I
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Count
interposed
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
why
not
question
the
housekeeper
?
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Why
not
go
,
Percival
,
to
the
fountain
-
head
of
information
at
once
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
right
!
"
said
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
the
housekeeper
is
the
first
person
to
question
.
<EOS>
Excessively
stupid
of
me
not
to
see
it
myself
.
<EOS>
"
With
those
words
he
instantly
left
us
to
return
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
The
motive
of
the
Count
's
interference
,
which
had
puzzled
me
at
first
,
betrayed
itself
when
Sir
Percival
's
back
was
turned
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
host
of
questions
to
put
to
me
about
Mrs.
Catherick
,
and
the
cause
of
her
visit
to
Blackwater
Park
,
which
he
could
scarcely
have
asked
in
his
friend
's
presence
.
<EOS>
I
made
my
answers
as
short
as
I
civilly
could
,
for
I
had
already
determined
to
check
the
least
approach
to
any
exchanging
of
confidences
between
Count
Fosco
and
myself
.
<EOS>
Laura
,
however
,
unconsciously
helped
him
to
extract
all
my
information
,
by
making
inquiries
herself
,
which
left
me
no
alternative
but
to
reply
to
her
,
or
to
appear
in
the
very
unenviable
and
very
false
character
of
a
depositary
of
Sir
Percival
's
secrets
.
<EOS>
The
end
of
it
was
,
that
,
in
about
ten
minutes
'
time
,
the
Count
knew
as
much
as
I
know
of
Mrs.
Catherick
,
and
of
the
events
which
have
so
strangely
connected
us
with
her
daughter
,
Anne
,
from
the
time
when
Hartright
met
with
her
to
this
day
.
  
<EOS>
The
effect
of
my
information
on
him
was
,
in
one
respect
,
curious
enough
.
  
<EOS>
Intimately
as
he
knows
Sir
Percival
,
and
closely
as
he
appears
to
be
associated
with
Sir
Percival
's
private
affairs
in
general
,
he
is
certainly
as
far
as
I
am
from
knowing
anything
of
the
true
story
of
Anne
Catherick
.
<EOS>
The
unsolved
mystery
in
connection
with
this
unhappy
woman
is
now
rendered
doubly
suspicious
,
in
my
eyes
,
by
the
absolute
conviction
which
I
feel
,
that
the
clue
to
it
has
been
hidden
by
Sir
Percival
from
the
most
intimate
friend
he
has
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
mistake
the
eager
curiosity
of
the
Count
's
look
and
manner
while
he
drank
in
greedily
every
word
that
fell
from
my
lips
.
<EOS>
There
are
many
kinds
of
curiosity
,
I
know
 
<EOS>
but
there
is
no
misinterpreting
the
curiosity
of
blank
surprise
<EOS>
:
if
I
ever
saw
it
in
my
life
I
saw
it
in
the
Count
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
While
the
questions
and
answers
were
going
on
,
we
had
all
been
strolling
quietly
back
through
the
plantation
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
we
reached
the
house
the
first
object
that
we
saw
in
front
of
it
was
Sir
Percival
's
dog
-
cart
,
with
the
horse
put
to
and
the
groom
waiting
by
it
in
his
stable
-
jacket
.
<EOS>
If
these
unexpected
appearances
were
to
be
trusted
,
the
examination
of
the
house
-
keeper
had
produced
important
results
already
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
fine
horse
,
my
friend
,
"
said
the
Count
,
addressing
the
groom
with
the
most
engaging
familiarity
of
manner
,
"
You
are
going
to
drive
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
going
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
man
,
looking
at
his
stable
-
jacket
,
and
evidently
wondering
whether
the
foreign
gentleman
took
it
for
his
livery
.
<EOS>
"
My
master
drives
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
"
said
the
Count
,
"
does
he
indeed
?
<EOS>
I
wonder
he
gives
himself
the
trouble
when
he
has
got
you
to
drive
for
him
.
<EOS>
Is
he
going
to
fatigue
that
nice
,
shining
,
pretty
horse
by
taking
him
very
far
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
sir
,
"
answered
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
horse
is
a
mare
,
if
you
please
,
sir
.
<EOS>
She
's
the
highest
-
couraged
thing
we
've
got
in
the
stables
.
<EOS>
Her
name
's
Brown
Molly
,
sir
,
and
<EOS>
she
'll
go
till
she
drops
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
usually
takes
Isaac
of
York
for
the
short
distances
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
your
shining
courageous
Brown
Molly
for
the
long
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Logical
inference
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
continued
the
Count
,
wheeling
round
briskly
,
and
addressing
me
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
is
going
a
long
distance
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
made
no
reply
.
<EOS>
I
had
my
own
inferences
to
draw
,
from
what
I
knew
through
the
housekeeper
and
from
what
I
saw
before
me
,
and
I
did
not
choose
to
share
them
with
Count
Fosco
.
  
<EOS>
When
Sir
Percival
was
in
Cumberland
(
I
thought
to
myself
)
,
he
walked
away
a
long
distance
,
on
Anne
's
account
,
to
question
the
family
at
Todd
's
Corner
.
<EOS>
Now
he
is
in
Hampshire
,
is
he
going
to
drive
away
a
long
distance
,
on
Anne
's
account
again
,
to
question
Mrs.
Catherick
at
Welmingham
?
  
<EOS>
We
all
entered
the
house
.
<EOS>
As
we
crossed
the
hall
Sir
Percival
came
out
from
the
library
to
meet
us
.
<EOS>
He
looked
hurried
and
pale
and
anxious
 
but
for
all
that
,
he
was
in
his
most
polite
mood
when
he
spoke
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
say
I
am
obliged
to
leave
you
,
"
he
began
 
"
a
long
drive
 
a
matter
that
I
ca
n't
very
well
put
off
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
back
in
good
time
to
-
morrow
 
<EOS>
but
before
I
go
I
should
like
that
little
business
-
formality
,
which
I
spoke
of
this
morning
,
to
be
settled
.
<EOS>
Laura
,
will
you
come
into
the
library
?
<EOS>
It
wo
n't
take
a
minute
 
a
mere
formality
.
<EOS>
Countess
,
may
I
trouble
you
also
?
<EOS>
I
want
you
and
the
Countess
,
Fosco
,
to
be
witnesses
to
a
signature
 
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
Come
in
at
once
and
get
it
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
held
the
library
door
open
until
they
had
passed
in
,
followed
them
,
and
shut
it
softly
.
  
<EOS>
I
remained
,
for
a
moment
afterwards
,
standing
alone
in
the
hall
,
with
my
heart
beating
fast
and
<EOS>
my
mind
misgiving
me
sadly
.
<EOS>
Then
I
went
on
to
the
staircase
,
and
ascended
slowly
to
my
own
room
.
    
<EOS>
June
17th
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
my
hand
was
on
the
door
of
my
room
,
I
heard
Sir
Percival
's
voice
calling
to
me
from
below
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
beg
you
to
come
downstairs
again
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
Fosco
's
fault
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
not
mine
.
<EOS>
He
has
started
some
nonsensical
objection
to
his
wife
being
one
of
the
witnesses
,
and
has
obliged
me
to
ask
you
to
join
us
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
entered
the
room
immediately
with
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
Laura
was
waiting
by
the
writing
-
table
,
twisting
and
turning
her
garden
hat
uneasily
in
her
hands
.
<EOS>
Madame
Fosco
sat
near
her
,
in
an
arm
-
chair
,
imperturbably
admiring
her
husband
,
who
stood
by
himself
at
the
other
end
of
the
library
,
picking
off
the
dead
leaves
from
the
flowers
in
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
The
moment
I
appeared
the
Count
advanced
to
meet
me
,
and
to
offer
his
explanations
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
thousand
pardons
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
the
character
which
is
given
to
my
countrymen
by
the
English
?
<EOS>
We
Italians
are
all
wily
and
suspicious
by
nature
,
in
the
estimation
of
the
good
John
Bull
.
<EOS>
Set
me
down
,
if
you
please
,
as
being
no
better
than
the
rest
of
my
race
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
wily
Italian
and
a
suspicious
Italian
.
<EOS>
You
have
thought
so
yourself
,
dear
lady
,
have
you
not
?
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
it
is
part
of
my
wiliness
and
part
of
my
suspicion
to
object
to
Madame
Fosco
being
a
witness
to
Lady
Glyde
's
signature
,
when
I
am
also
a
witness
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
not
the
shadow
of
a
reason
for
his
objection
,
"
interposed
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
explained
to
him
that
the
law
of
England
allows
Madame
Fosco
to
witness
a
signature
as
well
as
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
admit
it
,
"
resumed
the
Count
.
<EOS>
"
The
law
of
England
says
,
Yes
,
but
the
conscience
of
Fosco
says
,
No
.
"
<EOS>
He
spread
out
his
fat
fingers
on
the
bosom
of
his
blouse
,
and
bowed
solemnly
,
as
if
he
wished
to
introduce
his
conscience
to
us
all
,
in
the
character
of
an
illustrious
addition
to
the
society
.
<EOS>
"
What
this
document
which
Lady
Glyde
is
about
to
sign
may
be
,
"
he
continued
,
"
I
neither
know
nor
desire
to
know
.
<EOS>
I
only
say
this
,
circumstances
may
happen
in
the
future
which
may
oblige
Percival
,
or
his
representatives
,
to
appeal
to
the
two
witnesses
,
in
which
case
it
is
certainly
desirable
that
those
witnesses
should
represent
two
opinions
which
are
perfectly
independent
the
one
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
This
can
not
be
if
my
wife
signs
as
well
as
myself
,
because
we
have
but
one
opinion
between
us
,
and
that
opinion
is
mine
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
have
it
cast
in
my
teeth
,
at
some
future
day
,
that
Madame
Fosco
acted
under
my
coercion
,
and
was
,
in
plain
fact
,
no
witness
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
speak
in
Percival
's
interest
,
when
I
propose
that
my
name
shall
appear
(
as
the
nearest
friend
of
the
husband
)
,
and
your
name
,
Miss
Halcombe
(
as
the
nearest
friend
of
the
wife
)
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
Jesuit
,
if
you
please
to
think
<EOS>
so
 
a
splitter
of
straws
 
a
man
of
trifles
and
crochets
and
scruples
 
<EOS>
but
you
will
humour
me
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
in
merciful
consideration
for
my
suspicious
Italian
character
,
and
my
uneasy
Italian
conscience
.
"
<EOS>
He
bowed
again
,
stepped
back
a
few
paces
,
and
withdrew
his
conscience
from
our
society
as
politely
as
he
had
introduced
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
Count
's
scruples
might
have
been
honourable
and
reasonable
enough
,
but
there
was
something
in
his
manner
of
expressing
them
which
increased
my
unwillingness
to
be
concerned
in
the
business
of
the
signature
.
<EOS>
No
consideration
of
less
importance
than
my
consideration
for
Laura
would
have
induced
me
to
consent
to
be
a
witness
at
all
.
<EOS>
One
look
,
however
,
at
her
anxious
face
decided
me
to
risk
anything
rather
than
desert
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
readily
remain
in
the
room
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
if
I
find
no
reason
for
starting
any
small
scruples
on
my
side
,
you
may
rely
on
me
as
a
witness
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
looked
at
me
sharply
,
as
if
he
was
about
to
say
something
.
<EOS>
But
at
the
same
moment
,
Madame
Fosco
attracted
his
attention
by
rising
from
her
chair
.
<EOS>
She
had
caught
her
husband
's
eye
,
and
had
evidently
received
her
orders
to
leave
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
go
,
"
said
Sir
Percival
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Fosco
looked
for
her
orders
again
,
got
them
again
,
said
she
would
prefer
leaving
us
to
our
business
,
and
resolutely
walked
out
.
<EOS>
The
Count
lit
a
cigarette
,
went
back
to
the
flowers
in
the
window
,
and
puffed
little
jets
of
smoke
at
the
leaves
,
in
a
state
of
the
deepest
anxiety
about
killing
the
insects
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Sir
Percival
unlocked
a
cupboard
beneath
one
of
the
book
-
cases
,
and
produced
from
it
a
piece
of
parchment
,
folded
longwise
,
many
times
over
.
<EOS>
He
placed
it
on
the
table
,
opened
the
last
fold
only
,
and
kept
his
hand
on
the
rest
.
<EOS>
The
last
fold
displayed
a
strip
of
blank
parchment
with
little
wafers
stuck
on
it
at
certain
places
.
<EOS>
Every
line
of
the
writing
was
hidden
in
the
part
which
he
still
held
folded
up
under
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Laura
and
I
looked
at
each
other
.
<EOS>
Her
face
was
pale
,
but
it
showed
no
indecision
and
no
fear
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
dipped
a
pen
in
ink
,
and
handed
it
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
Sign
your
name
there
,
"
he
said
,
pointing
to
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
You
and
Fosco
are
to
sign
afterwards
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
opposite
those
two
wafers
.
<EOS>
Come
here
,
Fosco
!
<EOS>
witnessing
a
signature
is
not
to
be
done
by
mooning
out
of
window
and
smoking
into
the
flowers
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Count
threw
away
his
cigarette
,
and
joined
us
at
the
table
,
with
his
hands
carelessly
thrust
into
the
scarlet
belt
of
his
blouse
,
and
his
eyes
steadily
fixed
on
Sir
Percival
's
face
.
<EOS>
Laura
,
who
was
on
the
other
side
of
her
husband
,
with
the
pen
in
her
hand
,
looked
at
him
too
.
<EOS>
He
stood
between
them
holding
the
folded
parchment
down
firmly
on
the
table
,
and
glancing
across
at
me
,
as
I
sat
opposite
to
him
,
with
such
a
sinister
mixture
of
suspicion
and
embarrassment
on
his
face
that
he
looked
more
like
a
prisoner
at
the
bar
than
a
gentleman
in
his
own
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sign
there
,
"
he
repeated
,
turning
suddenly
on
Laura
,
and
pointing
once
more
to
the
place
on
the
parchment
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
I
am
to
sign
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
quietly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
time
to
explain
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
The
dog
-
cart
is
at
the
door
,
and
I
must
go
directly
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
if
I
had
time
,
you
would
n't
understand
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
purely
formal
document
,
full
of
legal
technicalities
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
Come
!
<EOS>
come
!
<EOS>
sign
your
name
,
and
let
us
have
done
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ought
surely
to
know
what
I
am
signing
,
Sir
Percival
,
before
I
write
my
name
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nonsense
!
<EOS>
What
have
women
to
do
with
business
?
<EOS>
I
tell
you
again
,
you
ca
n't
understand
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
let
me
try
to
understand
it
.
<EOS>
Whenever
Mr.
Gilmore
had
any
business
for
me
to
do
,
he
always
explained
it
first
,
and
I
always
understood
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
he
did
.
<EOS>
He
was
your
servant
,
and
was
obliged
to
explain
.
<EOS>
I
am
your
husband
,
and
am
NOT
obliged
.
<EOS>
How
much
longer
do
you
mean
to
keep
me
here
?
<EOS>
I
tell
you
again
,
there
is
no
time
for
reading
anything
 
<EOS>
the
dog
-
cart
is
waiting
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
Once
for
all
,
will
you
sign
or
will
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
still
had
the
pen
in
her
hand
,
but
she
made
no
approach
to
signing
her
name
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
my
signature
pledges
me
to
anything
,
"
she
said
,
"
surely
I
have
some
claim
to
know
what
that
pledge
is
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
lifted
up
the
parchment
,
and
struck
it
angrily
on
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
Speak
out
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
were
always
famous
for
telling
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Never
mind
Miss
Halcombe
,
never
mind
Fosco
 
say
,
in
plain
terms
,
you
distrust
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Count
took
one
of
his
hands
out
of
his
belt
and
laid
it
on
Sir
Percival
's
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
shook
it
off
irritably
.
<EOS>
The
Count
put
it
on
again
with
unruffled
composure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Control
your
unfortunate
temper
,
Percival
,
"
he
said
"
Lady
Glyde
is
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Right
!
"
cried
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
wife
right
in
distrusting
her
husband
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
unjust
and
cruel
to
accuse
me
of
distrusting
you
,
"
said
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ask
Marian
if
I
am
not
justified
in
wanting
to
know
what
this
writing
requires
of
me
before
I
sign
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
have
any
appeals
made
to
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
retorted
Sir
Percival
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
not
spoken
hitherto
,
and
I
would
much
rather
not
have
spoken
now
.
<EOS>
But
the
expression
of
distress
in
Laura
's
face
when
she
turned
it
towards
me
,
and
the
insolent
injustice
of
her
husband
's
conduct
,
left
me
no
other
alternative
than
to
give
my
opinion
,
for
her
sake
,
as
soon
as
I
was
asked
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
Sir
Percival
,
"
I
said
 
"
<EOS>
but
as
one
of
the
witnesses
to
the
signature
,
I
venture
to
think
that
I
HAVE
something
to
do
with
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Laura
's
objection
seems
to
me
a
perfectly
fair
one
,
and
speaking
for
myself
only
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
assume
the
responsibility
of
witnessing
her
signature
,
unless
she
first
understands
what
the
writing
is
which
you
wish
her
to
sign
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
cool
declaration
,
upon
my
soul
!
"
cried
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
"
The
next
time
you
invite
yourself
to
a
man
's
house
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
I
recommend
you
not
to
repay
his
hospitality
by
taking
his
wife
's
side
against
him
in
a
matter
that
does
n't
concern
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
started
to
my
feet
as
suddenly
as
if
he
had
struck
me
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
a
man
,
I
would
have
knocked
him
down
on
the
threshold
of
his
own
door
,
and
have
left
his
house
,
never
on
any
earthly
consideration
to
enter
it
again
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
only
a
woman
 
<EOS>
and
I
loved
his
wife
so
dearly
!
  
<EOS>
Thank
God
,
that
faithful
love
helped
me
,
and
I
sat
down
again
without
saying
a
word
.
<EOS>
SHE
knew
what
I
had
suffered
and
what
I
had
suppressed
.
<EOS>
She
ran
round
to
me
,
with
the
tears
streaming
from
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Marian
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
whispered
softly
.
<EOS>
"
If
my
mother
had
been
alive
,
she
could
have
done
no
more
for
me
!
"
  
"
Come
back
and
sign
!
"
cried
Sir
Percival
from
the
other
side
of
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
in
my
ear
;
"
I
will
,
if
you
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
right
and
the
truth
are
with
you
 
sign
nothing
,
unless
you
have
read
it
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
back
and
sign
!
"
<EOS>
he
reiterated
,
in
his
loudest
and
angriest
tones
.
  
<EOS>
The
Count
,
who
had
watched
Laura
and
me
with
a
close
and
silent
attention
,
interposed
for
the
second
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
Percival
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
remember
that
I
am
in
the
presence
of
ladies
.
<EOS>
Be
good
enough
,
if
you
please
,
to
remember
it
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
turned
on
him
speechless
with
passion
.
<EOS>
The
Count
's
firm
hand
slowly
tightened
its
grasp
on
his
shoulder
,
and
the
Count
's
steady
voice
quietly
repeated
,
"
Be
good
enough
,
if
you
please
,
to
remember
it
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
both
looked
at
each
other
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
slowly
drew
his
shoulder
from
under
the
Count
's
hand
,
slowly
turned
his
face
away
from
the
Count
's
eyes
,
doggedly
looked
down
for
a
little
while
at
the
parchment
on
the
table
,
and
then
spoke
,
with
the
sullen
submission
of
a
tamed
animal
,
rather
than
the
becoming
resignation
of
a
convinced
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
offend
anybody
,
"
he
said
,
"
but
my
wife
's
obstinacy
is
enough
to
try
the
patience
of
a
saint
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
her
this
is
merely
a
formal
document
 
and
<EOS>
what
more
can
she
want
?
<EOS>
You
may
say
what
you
please
,
but
it
is
no
part
of
a
woman
's
duty
to
set
her
husband
at
defiance
.
<EOS>
Once
more
,
Lady
Glyde
,
and
for
the
last
time
,
will
you
sign
or
will
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
Laura
returned
to
his
side
of
the
table
,
and
took
up
the
pen
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
sign
with
pleasure
,
"
she
said
,
"
if
you
will
only
treat
me
as
a
responsible
being
.
<EOS>
I
care
little
what
sacrifice
is
required
of
me
,
if
it
will
affect
no
one
else
,
and
lead
to
no
ill
results
 
"
  
"
Who
talked
of
a
sacrifice
being
required
of
You
?
"
<EOS>
he
broke
in
,
with
a
half
-
suppressed
return
of
his
former
violence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
meant
,
"
she
resumed
,
"
that
I
would
refuse
no
concession
which
I
could
honourably
make
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
a
scruple
about
signing
my
name
to
an
engagement
of
which
I
know
nothing
,
why
should
you
visit
it
on
me
so
severely
?
<EOS>
It
is
rather
hard
,
I
think
,
to
treat
Count
Fosco
's
scruples
so
much
more
indulgently
than
you
have
treated
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
unfortunate
,
yet
most
natural
,
reference
to
the
Count
's
extraordinary
power
over
her
husband
,
indirect
as
it
was
,
set
Sir
Percival
's
smouldering
temper
on
fire
again
in
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Scruples
!
"
<EOS>
he
repeated
.
"
<EOS>
YOUR
scruples
!
<EOS>
It
is
rather
late
in
the
day
for
you
to
be
scrupulous
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
thought
you
had
got
over
all
weakness
of
that
sort
,
when
you
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
by
marrying
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
instant
he
spoke
those
words
<EOS>
,
Laura
threw
down
the
pen
 
looked
at
him
with
an
expression
in
her
eyes
which
,
throughout
all
my
experience
of
her
,
I
had
never
seen
in
them
before
,
and
turned
her
back
on
him
in
dead
silence
.
  
<EOS>
This
strong
expression
of
the
most
open
and
the
most
bitter
contempt
was
so
entirely
unlike
herself
,
so
utterly
out
of
her
character
,
that
it
silenced
us
all
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
hidden
,
beyond
a
doubt
,
under
the
mere
surface
-
brutality
of
the
words
which
her
husband
had
just
addressed
to
her
.
<EOS>
There
was
some
lurking
insult
beneath
them
,
of
which
I
was
wholly
ignorant
,
but
which
had
left
the
mark
of
its
profanation
so
plainly
on
her
face
that
even
a
stranger
might
have
seen
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
Count
,
who
was
no
stranger
,
saw
it
as
distinctly
as
I
did
.
<EOS>
When
I
left
my
chair
to
join
Laura
,
I
heard
him
whisper
under
his
breath
to
Sir
Percival
,
"
You
idiot
!
"
  
<EOS>
Laura
walked
before
me
to
the
door
as
I
advanced
,
and
at
the
same
time
her
husband
spoke
to
her
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
positively
refuse
,
then
,
to
give
me
your
signature
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
in
the
altered
tone
of
a
man
who
was
conscious
that
he
had
let
his
own
licence
of
language
seriously
injure
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
After
what
you
have
just
said
to
me
,
"
she
replied
firmly
,
"
I
refuse
my
signature
until
I
have
read
every
line
in
that
parchment
from
the
first
word
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
Come
away
,
Marian
,
we
have
remained
here
long
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
moment
!
"
interposed
the
Count
before
Sir
Percival
could
speak
again
 
"
one
moment
,
Lady
Glyde
,
I
implore
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Laura
would
have
left
the
room
without
noticing
him
,
but
I
stopped
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
make
an
enemy
of
the
Count
!
"
<EOS>
I
whispered
.
<EOS>
"
Whatever
you
do
,
do
n't
make
an
enemy
of
the
Count
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
yielded
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
closed
the
door
again
,
and
we
stood
near
it
waiting
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
sat
down
at
the
table
,
with
his
elbow
on
the
folded
parchment
,
and
his
head
resting
on
his
clenched
fist
.
<EOS>
The
Count
stood
between
us
 
master
of
the
dreadful
position
in
which
we
were
placed
,
as
he
was
master
of
everything
else
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Glyde
,
"
he
said
,
with
a
gentleness
which
seemed
to
address
itself
to
our
forlorn
situation
instead
of
to
ourselves
,
"
pray
pardon
me
if
I
venture
to
offer
one
suggestion
,
and
pray
believe
that
I
speak
out
of
my
profound
respect
and
my
friendly
regard
for
the
mistress
of
this
house
.
"
<EOS>
He
turned
sharply
towards
Sir
Percival
.
"
<EOS>
Is
it
absolutely
necessary
,
"
he
asked
"
that
this
thing
here
,
under
your
elbow
,
should
be
signed
to
-
day
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
necessary
to
my
plans
and
wishes
,
"
returned
the
other
sulkily
.
"
<EOS>
But
that
consideration
,
as
you
may
have
noticed
,
has
no
influence
with
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Answer
my
plain
question
plainly
.
<EOS>
Can
the
business
of
the
signature
be
put
off
till
to
-
morrow
 
<EOS>
Yes
or
No
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
if
you
will
have
it
so
.
"
  
"
Then
what
are
you
wasting
your
time
for
here
?
<EOS>
Let
the
signature
wait
till
to
-
morrow
 
<EOS>
let
it
wait
till
you
come
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
looked
up
with
a
frown
and
an
oath
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
taking
a
tone
with
me
that
I
do
n't
like
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
A
tone
I
wo
n't
bear
from
any
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
advising
you
for
your
good
,
"
returned
the
Count
,
with
a
smile
of
quiet
contempt
.
"
<EOS>
Give
yourself
time
 
give
Lady
Glyde
time
.
<EOS>
Have
you
forgotten
that
your
dog
-
cart
is
waiting
at
the
door
?
<EOS>
My
tone
surprises
you
 
<EOS>
ha
?
<EOS>
I
dare
say
it
does
 
<EOS>
it
is
the
tone
of
a
man
who
can
keep
his
temper
.
<EOS>
How
many
doses
of
good
advice
have
I
given
you
in
my
time
?
<EOS>
More
than
you
can
count
.
<EOS>
Have
I
ever
been
wrong
?
<EOS>
I
defy
you
to
quote
me
an
instance
of
it
.
<EOS>
Go
!
<EOS>
take
your
drive
.
<EOS>
The
matter
of
the
signature
can
wait
till
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Let
it
wait
 
and
renew
it
when
you
come
back
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
hesitated
and
looked
at
his
watch
.
<EOS>
His
anxiety
about
the
secret
journey
which
he
was
to
take
that
day
,
revived
by
the
Count
's
words
,
was
now
evidently
disputing
possession
of
his
mind
with
his
anxiety
to
obtain
Laura
's
signature
.
<EOS>
He
considered
for
a
little
while
,
and
then
got
up
from
his
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
easy
to
argue
me
down
,
"
he
said
,
"
when
I
have
no
time
to
answer
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
your
advice
,
Fosco
 
not
because
I
want
it
,
or
believe
in
it
,
but
because
I
ca
n't
stop
here
any
longer
.
"
<EOS>
He
paused
,
and
looked
round
darkly
at
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
give
me
your
signature
when
I
come
back
to
-
morrow
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
rest
was
lost
in
the
noise
of
his
opening
the
book
-
case
cupboard
again
,
and
locking
up
the
parchment
once
more
.
<EOS>
He
took
his
hat
and
gloves
off
the
table
,
and
made
for
the
door
.
<EOS>
Laura
and
I
drew
back
to
let
him
pass
.
"
<EOS>
Remember
to
-
morrow
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
to
his
wife
,
and
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
We
waited
to
give
him
time
to
cross
the
hall
and
drive
away
.
<EOS>
The
Count
approached
us
while
we
were
standing
near
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
just
seen
Percival
at
his
worst
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
As
his
old
friend
,
I
am
sorry
for
him
and
ashamed
of
him
.
<EOS>
As
his
old
friend
,
I
promise
you
that
he
shall
not
break
out
to
-
morrow
in
the
same
disgraceful
manner
in
which
he
has
broken
out
to
-
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
Laura
had
taken
my
arm
while
he
was
speaking
<EOS>
and
she
pressed
it
significantly
when
he
had
done
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
a
hard
trial
to
any
woman
to
stand
by
and
see
the
office
of
apologist
for
her
husband
's
misconduct
quietly
assumed
by
his
male
friend
in
her
own
house
 
<EOS>
and
it
was
a
trial
to
HER
.
<EOS>
I
thanked
the
Count
civilly
,
and
let
her
out
.
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
I
thanked
him
:
<EOS>
for
I
felt
already
,
with
a
sense
of
inexpressible
helplessness
and
humiliation
,
that
it
was
either
his
interest
or
his
caprice
to
make
sure
of
my
continuing
to
reside
at
Blackwater
Park
,
and
I
knew
after
Sir
Percival
's
conduct
to
me
,
that
without
the
support
of
the
Count
's
influence
,
I
could
not
hope
to
remain
there
.
<EOS>
His
influence
,
the
influence
of
all
others
that
I
dreaded
most
,
was
actually
the
one
tie
which
now
held
me
to
Laura
in
the
hour
of
her
utmost
need
!
  
<EOS>
We
heard
the
wheels
of
the
dog
-
cart
crashing
on
the
gravel
of
the
drive
as
we
came
into
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
had
started
on
his
journey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
going
to
,
Marian
?
"
<EOS>
Laura
whispered
.
<EOS>
"
Every
fresh
thing
he
does
seems
to
terrify
me
about
the
future
.
<EOS>
Have
you
any
suspicions
?
"
  
<EOS>
After
what
she
had
undergone
that
morning
,
I
was
unwilling
to
tell
her
my
suspicions
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
should
I
know
his
secrets
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
evasively
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
if
the
housekeeper
knows
?
"
<EOS>
she
persisted
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
She
must
be
quite
as
ignorant
as
we
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
Laura
shook
her
head
doubtfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
not
hear
from
the
housekeeper
that
there
was
a
report
of
Anne
Catherick
having
been
seen
in
this
neighbourhood
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
he
may
have
gone
away
to
look
for
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
compose
myself
,
Laura
,
by
not
thinking
about
it
at
all
,
and
after
what
has
happened
,
you
had
better
follow
my
example
.
<EOS>
Come
into
my
room
,
and
rest
and
quiet
yourself
a
little
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
sat
down
together
close
to
the
window
,
and
let
the
fragrant
summer
air
breathe
over
our
faces
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
ashamed
to
look
at
you
,
Marian
,
"
she
said
,
"
after
what
you
submitted
to
downstairs
,
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
own
love
,
I
am
almost
heartbroken
when
I
think
of
it
!
<EOS>
But
I
will
try
to
make
it
up
to
you
 
I
will
indeed
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
hush
!
"
<EOS>
I
replied
;
"
do
n't
talk
so
.
<EOS>
What
is
the
trifling
mortification
of
my
pride
compared
to
the
dreadful
sacrifice
of
your
happiness
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
heard
what
he
said
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
she
went
on
quickly
and
vehemently
.
<EOS>
"
You
heard
the
words
 
but
you
do
n't
know
what
they
meant
 
you
do
n't
know
why
I
threw
down
the
pen
and
turned
my
back
on
him
.
"
<EOS>
She
rose
in
sudden
agitation
,
and
walked
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
kept
many
things
from
your
knowledge
,
Marian
,
for
fear
of
distressing
you
,
and
making
you
unhappy
at
the
outset
of
our
new
lives
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
how
he
has
used
me
.
<EOS>
And
yet
you
ought
to
know
,
for
you
saw
how
he
used
me
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
You
heard
him
sneer
at
my
presuming
to
be
scrupulous
 
<EOS>
you
heard
him
say
I
had
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
in
marrying
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
sat
down
again
,
her
face
flushed
deeply
,
and
her
hands
twisted
and
twined
together
in
her
lap
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
tell
you
about
it
now
,
"
she
said
;
"
I
shall
burst
out
crying
if
I
tell
you
now
 
later
,
<EOS>
Marian
,
when
I
am
more
sure
of
myself
.
<EOS>
My
poor
head
aches
,
darling
 
aches
,
aches
,
aches
.
<EOS>
Where
is
your
smelling
-
bottle
?
<EOS>
Let
me
talk
to
you
about
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
given
him
my
signature
,
for
your
sake
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
give
it
to
him
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
I
would
rather
compromise
myself
than
compromise
you
.
<EOS>
After
your
taking
my
part
against
him
,
he
will
lay
all
the
blame
on
you
if
I
refuse
again
.
<EOS>
What
shall
we
do
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
for
a
friend
to
help
us
and
advise
us
!
 
<EOS>
a
friend
we
could
really
trust
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
sighed
bitterly
.
<EOS>
I
saw
in
her
face
that
she
was
thinking
of
Hartright
 
<EOS>
saw
it
the
more
plainly
because
her
last
words
set
me
thinking
of
him
too
.
<EOS>
In
six
months
only
from
her
marriage
we
wanted
the
faithful
service
he
had
offered
to
us
in
his
farewell
words
.
<EOS>
How
little
I
once
thought
that
we
should
ever
want
it
at
all
!
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
do
what
we
can
to
help
ourselves
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
try
to
talk
it
over
calmly
,
Laura
 
let
us
do
all
in
our
power
to
decide
for
the
best
.
"
  
<EOS>
Putting
what
she
knew
of
her
husband
's
embarrassments
and
what
I
had
heard
of
his
conversation
with
the
lawyer
together
,
we
arrived
necessarily
at
the
conclusion
that
the
parchment
in
the
library
had
been
drawn
up
for
the
purpose
of
borrowing
money
,
and
that
Laura
's
signature
was
absolutely
necessary
to
fit
it
for
the
attainment
of
Sir
Percival
's
object
.
  
<EOS>
The
second
question
,
concerning
the
nature
of
the
legal
contract
by
which
the
money
was
to
be
obtained
,
and
the
degree
of
personal
responsibility
to
which
Laura
might
subject
herself
if
she
signed
it
in
the
dark
,
involved
considerations
which
lay
far
beyond
any
knowledge
and
experience
that
either
of
us
possessed
.
<EOS>
My
own
convictions
led
me
to
believe
that
the
hidden
contents
of
the
parchment
concealed
a
transaction
of
the
meanest
and
the
most
fraudulent
kind
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
not
formed
this
conclusion
in
consequence
of
Sir
Percival
's
refusal
to
show
the
writing
or
to
explain
it
,
for
that
refusal
might
well
have
proceeded
from
his
obstinate
disposition
and
his
domineering
temper
alone
.
<EOS>
My
sole
motive
for
distrusting
his
honesty
sprang
from
the
change
which
I
had
observed
in
his
language
and
his
manners
at
Blackwater
Park
,
a
change
which
convinced
me
that
he
had
been
acting
a
part
throughout
the
whole
period
of
his
probation
at
Limmeridge
House
.
<EOS>
His
elaborate
delicacy
,
his
ceremonious
politeness
which
harmonised
so
agreeably
with
Mr.
Gilmore
's
old
-
fashioned
notions
,
his
modesty
with
Laura
,
his
candour
with
me
,
his
moderation
with
Mr.
Fairlie
 
all
these
were
the
artifices
of
a
mean
,
cunning
,
and
brutal
man
,
who
had
dropped
his
disguise
when
his
practised
duplicity
had
gained
its
end
,
and
had
openly
shown
himself
in
the
library
on
that
very
day
.
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
of
the
grief
which
this
discovery
caused
me
on
Laura
's
account
,
for
it
is
not
to
be
expressed
by
any
words
of
mine
.
<EOS>
I
only
refer
to
it
at
all
,
because
it
decided
me
to
oppose
her
signing
the
parchment
,
whatever
the
consequences
might
be
,
unless
she
was
first
made
acquainted
with
the
contents
.
  
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
,
the
one
chance
for
us
when
to
-
morrow
came
was
to
be
provided
with
an
objection
to
giving
the
signature
,
which
might
rest
on
sufficiently
firm
commercial
or
legal
grounds
to
shake
Sir
Percival
's
resolution
,
and
to
make
him
suspect
that
we
two
women
understood
the
laws
and
obligations
of
business
as
well
as
himself
.
  
<EOS>
After
some
pondering
,
I
determined
to
write
to
the
only
honest
man
within
reach
whom
we
could
trust
to
help
us
discreetly
in
our
forlorn
situation
.
<EOS>
That
man
was
Mr.
Gilmore
's
partner
,
Mr.
Kyrle
,
who
conducted
the
business
now
that
our
old
friend
had
been
obliged
to
withdraw
from
it
,
and
to
leave
London
on
account
of
his
health
.
<EOS>
I
explained
to
Laura
that
I
had
Mr.
Gilmore
's
own
authority
for
placing
implicit
confidence
in
his
partner
's
integrity
,
discretion
,
and
accurate
knowledge
of
all
her
affairs
,
and
with
her
full
approval
I
sat
down
at
once
to
write
the
letter
,
I
began
by
stating
our
position
to
Mr.
Kyrle
exactly
as
it
was
,
and
then
asked
for
his
advice
in
return
,
expressed
in
plain
,
downright
terms
which
he
could
comprehend
without
any
danger
of
misinterpretations
and
mistakes
.
<EOS>
My
letter
was
as
short
as
I
could
possibly
make
it
,
and
was
,
I
hope
,
unencumbered
by
needless
apologies
and
needless
details
.
  
<EOS>
Just
as
I
was
about
to
put
the
address
on
the
envelope
an
obstacle
was
discovered
by
Laura
,
which
in
the
effort
and
preoccupation
of
writing
had
escaped
my
mind
altogether
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
are
we
to
get
the
answer
in
time
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Your
letter
will
not
be
delivered
in
London
before
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
the
post
will
not
bring
the
reply
here
till
the
morning
after
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
only
way
of
overcoming
this
difficulty
was
to
have
the
answer
brought
to
us
from
the
lawyer
's
office
by
a
special
messenger
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
a
postscript
to
that
effect
,
begging
that
the
messenger
might
be
despatched
with
the
reply
by
the
eleven
o'clock
morning
train
,
which
would
bring
him
to
our
station
at
twenty
minutes
past
one
,
and
so
enable
him
to
reach
Blackwater
Park
by
two
o'clock
at
the
latest
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
be
directed
to
ask
for
me
,
to
answer
no
questions
addressed
to
him
by
any
one
else
,
and
to
deliver
his
letter
into
no
hands
but
mine
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
case
Sir
Percival
should
come
back
to
-
morrow
before
two
o'clock
,
"
I
said
to
Laura
,
"
the
wisest
plan
for
you
to
adopt
is
to
be
out
in
the
grounds
all
the
morning
with
your
book
or
your
work
,
and
not
to
appear
at
the
house
till
the
messenger
has
had
time
to
arrive
with
the
letter
.
<EOS>
I
will
wait
here
for
him
all
the
morning
,
to
guard
against
any
misadventures
or
mistakes
.
<EOS>
By
following
this
arrangement
I
hope
and
believe
we
shall
avoid
being
taken
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
Let
us
go
down
to
the
drawing
-
room
now
.
<EOS>
We
may
excite
suspicion
if
we
remain
shut
up
together
too
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Suspicion
?
<EOS>
"
she
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
Whose
suspicion
can
we
excite
,
now
that
Sir
Percival
has
left
the
house
?
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
Count
Fosco
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
do
,
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
beginning
to
dislike
him
as
much
as
I
do
,
Marian
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
not
to
dislike
him
.
<EOS>
Dislike
is
always
more
or
less
associated
with
contempt
 
<EOS>
I
can
see
nothing
in
the
Count
to
despise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
afraid
of
him
,
are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
am
 
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Afraid
of
him
,
after
his
interference
in
our
favour
to
-
day
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
am
more
afraid
of
his
interference
than
I
am
of
Sir
Percival
's
violence
.
<EOS>
Remember
what
I
said
to
you
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
Whatever
you
do
,
Laura
,
do
n't
make
an
enemy
of
the
Count
!
"
  
<EOS>
We
went
downstairs
.
<EOS>
Laura
entered
the
drawing
-
room
,
while
I
proceeded
across
the
hall
,
with
my
letter
in
my
hand
,
to
put
it
into
the
post
-
bag
,
which
hung
against
the
wall
opposite
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
The
house
door
was
open
,
and
as
I
crossed
past
it
,
I
saw
Count
Fosco
and
his
wife
standing
talking
together
on
the
steps
outside
,
with
their
faces
turned
towards
me
.
  
<EOS>
The
Countess
came
into
the
hall
rather
hastily
,
and
asked
if
I
had
leisure
enough
for
five
minutes
'
private
conversation
.
<EOS>
Feeling
a
little
surprised
by
such
an
appeal
from
such
a
person
,
I
put
my
letter
into
the
bag
,
and
replied
that
I
was
quite
at
her
disposal
.
<EOS>
She
took
my
arm
with
unaccustomed
friendliness
and
familiarity
,
and
instead
of
leading
me
into
an
empty
room
,
drew
me
out
with
her
to
the
belt
of
turf
which
surrounded
the
large
fish
-
pond
.
  
<EOS>
As
we
passed
the
Count
on
the
steps
he
bowed
and
smiled
,
and
then
went
at
once
into
the
house
,
pushing
the
hall
door
to
after
him
,
but
not
actually
closing
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
Countess
walked
me
gently
round
the
fish
-
pond
.
<EOS>
I
expected
to
be
made
the
depositary
of
some
extraordinary
confidence
,
and
I
was
astonished
to
find
that
Madame
Fosco
's
communication
for
my
private
ear
was
nothing
more
than
a
polite
assurance
of
her
sympathy
for
me
,
after
what
had
happened
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
had
told
her
of
all
that
had
passed
,
and
of
the
insolent
manner
in
which
Sir
Percival
had
spoken
to
me
.
<EOS>
This
information
had
so
shocked
and
distressed
her
,
on
my
account
and
on
Laura
's
,
that
she
had
made
up
her
mind
,
if
anything
of
the
sort
happened
again
,
to
mark
her
sense
of
Sir
Percival
's
outrageous
conduct
by
leaving
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
Count
had
approved
of
her
idea
,
and
she
now
hoped
that
I
approved
of
it
too
.
  
<EOS>
I
thought
this
a
very
strange
proceeding
on
the
part
of
such
a
remarkably
reserved
woman
as
Madame
Fosco
,
especially
after
the
interchange
of
sharp
speeches
which
had
passed
between
us
during
the
conversation
in
the
boat
-
house
on
that
very
morning
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
was
my
plain
duty
to
meet
a
polite
and
friendly
advance
on
the
part
of
one
of
my
elders
with
a
polite
and
friendly
reply
.
<EOS>
I
answered
the
Countess
accordingly
in
her
own
tone
,
and
then
,
thinking
we
had
said
all
that
was
necessary
on
either
side
,
made
an
attempt
to
get
back
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
But
Madame
Fosco
seemed
resolved
not
to
part
with
me
,
and
to
my
unspeakable
amazement
,
resolved
also
to
talk
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
the
most
silent
of
women
,
she
now
persecuted
me
with
fluent
conventionalities
on
the
subject
of
married
life
,
on
the
subject
of
Sir
Percival
and
Laura
,
on
the
subject
of
her
own
happiness
,
on
the
subject
of
the
late
Mr.
Fairlie
's
conduct
to
her
in
the
matter
of
her
legacy
,
and
on
half
a
dozen
other
subjects
besides
,
until
she
had
detained
me
walking
round
and
round
the
fish
-
pond
for
more
than
half
an
hour
,
and
had
quite
wearied
me
out
.
<EOS>
Whether
she
discovered
this
or
not
,
I
can
not
say
,
but
she
stopped
as
abruptly
as
she
had
begun
 
looked
towards
the
house
door
,
resumed
her
icy
manner
in
a
moment
,
and
dropped
my
arm
of
her
own
accord
before
I
could
think
of
an
excuse
for
accomplishing
my
own
release
from
her
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
pushed
open
the
door
and
entered
the
hall
,
I
found
myself
suddenly
face
to
face
with
the
Count
again
.
<EOS>
He
was
just
putting
a
letter
into
the
post
-
bag
.
  
<EOS>
After
he
had
dropped
it
in
and
had
closed
the
bag
,
he
asked
me
where
I
had
left
Madame
Fosco
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
,
and
he
went
out
at
the
hall
door
immediately
to
join
his
wife
.
<EOS>
His
manner
when
he
spoke
to
me
was
so
unusually
quiet
and
subdued
that
I
turned
and
looked
after
him
,
wondering
if
he
were
ill
or
out
of
spirits
.
  
<EOS>
Why
my
next
proceeding
was
to
go
straight
up
to
the
post
-
bag
and
take
out
my
own
letter
and
look
at
it
again
,
with
a
vague
distrust
on
me
,
and
why
the
looking
at
it
for
the
second
time
instantly
suggested
the
idea
to
my
mind
of
sealing
the
envelope
for
its
greater
security
 
are
mysteries
which
are
either
too
deep
or
too
shallow
for
me
to
fathom
.
<EOS>
Women
,
as
everybody
knows
,
constantly
act
on
impulses
which
they
can
not
explain
even
to
themselves
,
and
I
can
only
suppose
that
one
of
those
impulses
was
the
hidden
cause
of
my
unaccountable
conduct
on
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Whatever
influence
animated
me
,
I
found
cause
to
congratulate
myself
on
having
obeyed
it
as
soon
as
I
prepared
to
seal
the
letter
in
my
own
room
.
<EOS>
I
had
originally
closed
the
envelope
in
the
usual
way
by
moistening
the
adhesive
point
and
pressing
it
on
the
paper
beneath
,
and
when
I
now
tried
it
with
my
finger
,
after
a
lapse
of
full
three
-
quarters
of
an
hour
,
the
envelope
opened
on
the
instant
,
without
sticking
or
tearing
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
had
fastened
it
insufficiently
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
there
might
have
been
some
defect
in
the
adhesive
gum
?
  
<EOS>
Or
,
perhaps
 
No
!
<EOS>
it
is
quite
revolting
enough
to
feel
that
third
conjecture
stirring
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
not
see
it
confronting
me
in
plain
black
and
white
.
  
<EOS>
I
almost
dread
to
-
morrow
 
so
much
depends
on
my
discretion
and
self
-
control
.
<EOS>
There
are
two
precautions
,
at
all
events
,
which
I
am
sure
not
to
forget
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
careful
to
keep
up
friendly
appearances
with
the
Count
,
and
I
must
be
well
on
my
guard
when
the
messenger
from
the
office
comes
here
with
the
answer
to
my
letter
.
    
<EOS>
June
17th
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
dinner
hour
brought
us
together
again
,
Count
Fosco
was
in
his
usual
excellent
spirits
.
<EOS>
He
exerted
himself
to
interest
and
amuse
us
,
as
if
he
was
determined
to
efface
from
our
memories
all
recollection
of
what
had
passed
in
the
library
that
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Lively
descriptions
of
his
adventures
in
travelling
,
amusing
anecdotes
of
remarkable
people
whom
he
had
met
with
abroad
,
quaint
comparisons
between
the
social
customs
of
various
nations
,
illustrated
by
examples
drawn
from
men
and
women
indiscriminately
all
over
Europe
,
humorous
confessions
of
the
innocent
follies
of
his
own
early
life
,
when
he
ruled
the
fashions
of
a
second
-
rate
Italian
town
,
and
wrote
preposterous
romances
on
the
French
model
for
a
second
-
rate
Italian
newspaper
 
all
flowed
in
succession
so
easily
and
so
gaily
from
his
lips
,
and
all
addressed
our
various
curiosities
and
various
interests
so
directly
and
so
delicately
,
that
Laura
and
I
listened
to
him
with
as
much
attention
and
,
inconsistent
as
it
may
seem
,
with
as
much
admiration
also
,
as
Madame
Fosco
herself
.
<EOS>
Women
can
resist
a
man
's
love
,
a
man
's
fame
,
a
man
's
personal
appearance
,
and
a
man
's
money
,
but
they
can
not
resist
a
man
's
tongue
when
he
knows
how
to
talk
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
After
dinner
,
while
the
favourable
impression
which
he
had
produced
on
us
was
still
vivid
in
our
minds
,
the
Count
modestly
withdrew
to
read
in
the
library
.
  
<EOS>
Laura
proposed
a
stroll
in
the
grounds
to
enjoy
the
close
of
the
long
evening
.
<EOS>
It
was
necessary
in
common
politeness
to
ask
Madame
Fosco
to
join
us
,
but
this
time
she
had
apparently
received
her
orders
beforehand
,
and
she
begged
we
would
kindly
excuse
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Count
will
probably
want
a
fresh
supply
of
cigarettes
,
"
she
remarked
by
way
of
apology
,
"
and
nobody
can
make
them
to
his
satisfaction
but
myself
.
"
<EOS>
Her
cold
blue
eyes
almost
warmed
as
she
spoke
the
words
 
she
looked
actually
proud
of
being
the
officiating
medium
through
which
her
lord
and
master
composed
himself
with
tobacco
-
smoke
!
  
<EOS>
Laura
and
I
went
out
together
alone
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
misty
,
heavy
evening
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
sense
of
blight
in
the
air
;
the
flowers
were
drooping
in
the
garden
,
and
the
ground
was
parched
and
dewless
.
<EOS>
The
western
heaven
,
as
we
saw
it
over
the
quiet
trees
,
was
of
a
pale
yellow
hue
,
and
the
sun
was
setting
faintly
in
a
haze
.
<EOS>
Coming
rain
seemed
near
 
it
would
fall
probably
with
the
fall
of
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
Which
way
shall
we
go
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
  
"
Towards
the
lake
,
Marian
,
if
you
like
,
"
she
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
seem
unaccountably
fond
,
Laura
,
of
that
dismal
lake
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
not
of
the
lake
but
of
the
scenery
about
it
.
<EOS>
The
sand
and
heath
and
the
fir
-
trees
are
the
only
objects
I
can
discover
,
in
all
this
large
place
,
to
remind
me
of
Limmeridge
.
<EOS>
But
we
will
walk
in
some
other
direction
if
you
prefer
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
favourite
walks
at
Blackwater
Park
,
my
love
.
<EOS>
One
is
the
same
as
another
to
me
.
<EOS>
Let
us
go
to
the
lake
 
<EOS>
we
may
find
it
cooler
in
the
open
space
than
we
find
it
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
walked
through
the
shadowy
plantation
in
silence
.
<EOS>
The
heaviness
in
the
evening
air
oppressed
us
both
,
and
when
we
reached
the
boat
-
house
we
were
glad
to
sit
down
and
rest
inside
.
  
<EOS>
A
white
fog
hung
low
over
the
lake
.
<EOS>
The
dense
brown
line
of
the
trees
on
the
opposite
bank
appeared
above
it
,
like
a
dwarf
forest
floating
in
the
sky
.
<EOS>
The
sandy
ground
,
shelving
downward
from
where
we
sat
,
was
lost
mysteriously
in
the
outward
layers
of
the
fog
.
<EOS>
The
silence
was
horrible
.
<EOS>
No
rustling
of
the
leaves
 
<EOS>
no
bird
's
note
in
the
wood
 
<EOS>
no
cry
of
water
-
fowl
from
the
pools
of
the
hidden
lake
.
<EOS>
Even
the
croaking
of
the
frogs
had
ceased
to
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
desolate
and
gloomy
,
"
said
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
can
be
more
alone
here
than
anywhere
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
spoke
quietly
and
looked
at
the
wilderness
of
sand
and
mist
with
steady
,
thoughtful
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
that
her
mind
was
too
much
occupied
to
feel
the
dreary
impressions
from
without
which
had
fastened
themselves
already
on
mine
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
promised
,
Marian
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
about
my
married
life
,
instead
of
leaving
you
any
longer
to
guess
it
for
yourself
,
"
she
began
.
<EOS>
"
That
secret
is
the
first
I
have
ever
had
from
you
,
love
,
and
I
am
determined
it
shall
be
the
last
.
<EOS>
I
was
silent
,
as
you
know
,
for
your
sake
 
and
perhaps
a
little
for
my
own
sake
as
well
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
hard
for
a
woman
to
confess
that
the
man
to
whom
she
has
given
her
whole
life
is
the
man
of
all
others
who
cares
least
for
the
gift
.
<EOS>
If
you
were
married
yourself
,
Marian
 
and
especially
if
you
were
happily
married
 
you
would
feel
for
me
as
no
single
woman
CAN
feel
,
however
kind
and
true
she
may
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
What
answer
could
I
make
?
<EOS>
I
could
only
take
her
hand
and
look
at
her
with
my
whole
heart
as
well
as
<EOS>
my
eyes
would
let
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
often
,
"
she
went
on
,
"
I
have
heard
you
laughing
over
what
you
used
to
call
your
"
poverty
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
how
often
you
have
made
me
mock
-
speeches
of
congratulation
on
my
wealth
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
Marian
,
never
laugh
again
.
<EOS>
Thank
God
for
your
poverty
 
<EOS>
it
has
made
you
your
own
mistress
,
and
has
saved
you
from
the
lot
that
has
fallen
on
ME
.

<EOS>
A
sad
beginning
on
the
lips
of
a
young
wife
!
 
<EOS>
sad
in
its
quiet
plain
-
spoken
truth
.
<EOS>
The
few
days
we
had
all
passed
together
at
Blackwater
Park
had
been
many
enough
to
show
me
 
to
show
any
one
 
what
her
husband
had
married
her
for
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
be
distressed
,
"
she
said
,
"
by
hearing
how
soon
my
disappointments
and
my
trials
began
 
or
even
by
knowing
what
they
were
.
<EOS>
It
is
bad
enough
to
have
them
on
my
memory
.
<EOS>
If
I
tell
you
how
he
received
the
first
and
last
attempt
at
remonstrance
that
I
ever
made
,
you
will
know
how
he
has
always
treated
me
,
as
well
as
if
I
had
described
it
in
so
many
words
.
<EOS>
It
was
one
day
at
Rome
when
we
had
ridden
out
together
to
the
tomb
of
Cecilia
Metella
.
<EOS>
The
sky
was
calm
and
lovely
,
and
the
grand
old
ruin
looked
beautiful
,
and
the
remembrance
that
a
husband
's
love
had
raised
it
in
the
old
time
to
a
wife
's
memory
,
made
me
feel
more
tenderly
and
more
anxiously
towards
my
husband
than
I
had
ever
felt
yet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Would
you
build
such
a
tomb
for
ME
,
Percival
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
said
you
loved
me
dearly
before
we
were
married
,
and
yet
,
since
that
time
 
"
I
could
get
no
farther
.
<EOS>
Marian
!
<EOS>
he
was
not
even
looking
at
me
!
<EOS>
I
pulled
down
my
veil
,
thinking
it
best
not
to
let
him
see
that
the
tears
were
in
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
fancied
he
had
not
paid
any
attention
to
me
,
but
he
had
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
"
Come
away
,
"
and
laughed
to
himself
as
he
helped
me
on
to
my
horse
.
<EOS>
He
mounted
his
own
horse
and
laughed
again
as
we
rode
away
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
do
build
you
a
tomb
,
"
he
said
,
"
it
will
be
done
with
your
own
money
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
Cecilia
Metella
had
a
fortune
and
paid
for
hers
.
<EOS>
"
I
made
no
reply
 
how
could
I
,
when
I
was
crying
behind
my
veil
?
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
you
light
-
complexioned
women
are
all
sulky
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
compliments
and
soft
speeches
?
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
'm
in
a
good
humour
this
morning
.
<EOS>
Consider
the
compliments
paid
and
the
speeches
said
.
<EOS>
"
Men
little
know
when
they
say
hard
things
to
us
<EOS>
how
well
we
remember
them
,
and
how
much
harm
they
do
us
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
better
for
me
if
I
had
gone
on
crying
,
but
his
contempt
dried
up
my
tears
and
hardened
my
heart
.
<EOS>
From
that
time
,
Marian
,
I
never
checked
myself
again
in
thinking
of
Walter
Hartright
.
<EOS>
I
let
the
memory
of
those
happy
days
,
when
we
were
so
fond
of
each
other
in
secret
,
come
back
and
comfort
me
.
<EOS>
What
else
had
I
to
look
to
for
consolation
?
<EOS>
If
we
had
been
together
you
would
have
helped
me
to
better
things
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
was
wrong
,
darling
,
but
tell
me
if
I
was
wrong
without
any
excuse
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
was
obliged
to
turn
my
face
from
her
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
ask
me
!
"
<EOS>
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Have
I
suffered
as
you
have
suffered
?
<EOS>
What
right
have
I
to
decide
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
used
to
think
of
him
,
"
she
pursued
,
dropping
her
voice
and
moving
closer
to
me
,
"
I
used
to
think
of
him
when
Percival
left
me
alone
at
night
to
go
among
the
Opera
people
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
fancy
what
I
might
have
been
if
it
had
pleased
God
to
bless
me
with
poverty
,
and
if
I
had
been
his
wife
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
see
myself
in
my
neat
cheap
gown
,
sitting
at
home
and
waiting
for
him
while
he
was
earning
our
bread
 
sitting
at
home
and
working
for
him
and
loving
him
all
the
better
because
I
had
to
work
for
him
 
seeing
him
come
in
tired
and
taking
off
his
hat
and
coat
for
him
,
and
,
Marian
,
pleasing
him
with
little
dishes
at
dinner
that
I
had
learnt
to
make
for
his
sake
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
hope
he
is
never
lonely
enough
and
sad
enough
to
think
of
me
and
see
me
as
I
have
thought
of
HIM
and
see
HIM
!
"
  
<EOS>
As
she
said
those
melancholy
words
,
all
the
lost
tenderness
returned
to
her
voice
,
and
all
the
lost
beauty
trembled
back
into
her
face
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
rested
as
lovingly
on
the
blighted
,
solitary
,
ill
-
omened
view
before
us
,
as
if
they
saw
the
friendly
hills
of
Cumberland
in
the
dim
and
threatening
sky
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
speak
of
Walter
any
more
,
"
I
said
,
as
soon
as
I
could
control
myself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Laura
,
spare
us
both
the
wretchedness
of
talking
of
him
now
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
roused
herself
,
and
looked
at
me
tenderly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
be
silent
about
him
for
ever
,
"
she
answered
,
"
than
cause
you
a
moment
's
pain
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
in
your
interests
,
"
I
pleaded
;
"
it
is
for
your
sake
that
I
speak
.
<EOS>
If
your
husband
heard
you
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
It
would
not
surprise
him
if
he
did
hear
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
made
that
strange
reply
with
a
weary
calmness
and
coldness
.
<EOS>
The
change
in
her
manner
,
when
she
gave
the
answer
,
startled
me
almost
as
much
as
the
answer
itself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
surprise
him
!
"
I
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Laura
!
<EOS>
remember
what
you
are
saying
 
you
frighten
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
,
"
she
said
;
"
it
is
what
I
wanted
to
tell
you
to
-
day
,
when
we
were
talking
in
your
room
.
<EOS>
My
only
secret
when
I
opened
my
heart
to
him
at
Limmeridge
was
a
harmless
secret
,
<EOS>
Marian
 
<EOS>
you
said
so
yourself
.
<EOS>
The
name
was
all
I
kept
from
him
,
and
he
has
discovered
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
heard
her
,
but
I
could
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
Her
last
words
had
killed
the
little
hope
that
still
lived
in
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
happened
at
Rome
,
"
she
went
on
,
as
wearily
calm
and
cold
as
ever
.
<EOS>
"
We
were
at
a
little
party
given
to
the
English
by
some
friends
of
Sir
Percival
's
 
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Markland
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Markland
had
the
reputation
of
sketching
very
beautifully
,
and
some
of
the
guests
prevailed
on
her
to
show
us
her
drawings
.
<EOS>
We
all
admired
them
,
but
something
I
said
attracted
her
attention
particularly
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
Surely
you
draw
yourself
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
.
<EOS>
"
I
used
to
draw
a
little
once
,
"
I
answered
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
given
it
up
.
"
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
once
drawn
,
"
she
said
,
"
you
may
take
to
it
again
one
of
these
days
,
and
if
you
do
,
I
wish
you
would
let
me
recommend
you
a
master
.
<EOS>
"
I
said
nothing
 
<EOS>
you
know
why
,
Marian
 
and
tried
to
change
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Markland
persisted
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
all
sorts
of
teachers
,
"
she
went
on
,
"
but
the
best
of
all
,
the
most
intelligent
and
the
most
attentive
,
was
a
Mr.
Hartright
.
<EOS>
If
you
ever
take
up
your
drawing
again
,
do
try
him
as
a
master
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
young
man
 
modest
and
gentlemanlike
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
will
like
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Think
of
those
words
being
spoken
to
me
publicly
,
in
the
presence
of
strangers
 
strangers
who
had
been
invited
to
meet
the
bride
and
bridegroom
!
<EOS>
I
did
all
I
could
to
control
myself
 
<EOS>
I
said
nothing
,
and
looked
down
close
at
the
drawings
.
<EOS>
When
I
ventured
to
raise
my
head
again
,
my
eyes
and
my
husband
's
eyes
met
,
and
I
knew
,
by
his
look
,
that
my
face
had
betrayed
me
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
see
about
Mr.
Hartright
,
"
he
said
,
looking
at
me
all
the
time
,
"
when
we
get
back
to
England
.
<EOS>
I
agree
with
you
,
Mrs.
Markland
 
<EOS>
I
think
Lady
Glyde
is
sure
to
like
him
.
"
<EOS>
He
laid
an
emphasis
on
the
last
words
which
made
my
cheeks
burn
,
and
set
my
heart
beating
as
if
it
would
stifle
me
.
<EOS>
Nothing
more
was
said
.
<EOS>
We
came
away
early
.
<EOS>
He
was
silent
in
the
carriage
driving
back
to
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
He
helped
me
out
,
and
followed
me
upstairs
as
usual
.
<EOS>
But
the
moment
we
were
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
he
locked
the
door
,
pushed
me
down
into
a
chair
,
and
stood
over
me
with
his
hands
on
my
shoulders
.
<EOS>
"
Ever
since
that
morning
when
you
made
your
audacious
confession
to
me
at
Limmeridge
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
have
wanted
to
find
out
the
man
,
and
I
found
him
in
your
face
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Your
drawing
-
master
was
the
man
,
and
his
name
is
Hartright
.
<EOS>
You
shall
repent
it
,
and
he
shall
repent
it
,
to
the
last
hour
of
your
lives
.
<EOS>
Now
go
to
bed
and
dream
of
him
if
you
like
,
with
the
marks
of
my
horsewhip
on
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
"
Whenever
he
is
angry
with
me
now
he
refers
to
what
I
acknowledged
to
him
in
your
presence
with
a
sneer
or
a
threat
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
power
to
prevent
him
from
putting
his
own
horrible
construction
on
the
confidence
I
placed
in
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
influence
to
make
him
believe
me
,
or
to
keep
him
silent
.
<EOS>
You
looked
surprised
to
-
day
when
you
heard
him
tell
me
that
I
had
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
in
marrying
him
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
be
surprised
again
when
you
hear
him
repeat
it
,
the
next
time
he
is
out
of
temper
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
Marian
!
<EOS>
do
n't
!
<EOS>
do
n't
!
<EOS>
you
hurt
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
caught
her
in
my
arms
,
and
the
sting
and
torment
of
my
remorse
had
closed
them
round
her
like
a
vice
.
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
my
remorse
.
<EOS>
The
white
despair
of
Walter
's
face
,
when
my
cruel
words
struck
him
to
the
heart
in
the
summer
-
house
at
Limmeridge
,
rose
before
me
in
mute
,
unendurable
reproach
.
<EOS>
My
hand
had
pointed
the
way
which
led
the
man
my
sister
loved
,
step
by
step
,
far
from
his
country
and
his
friends
.
<EOS>
Between
those
two
young
hearts
I
had
stood
,
to
sunder
them
for
ever
,
the
one
from
the
other
,
and
his
life
and
her
life
lay
wasted
before
me
alike
in
witness
of
the
deed
.
<EOS>
I
had
done
this
,
and
done
it
for
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
  
<EOS>
For
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
  
<EOS>
I
heard
her
speaking
,
and
I
knew
by
the
tone
of
her
voice
that
she
was
comforting
me
 
I
,
who
deserved
nothing
but
the
reproach
of
her
silence
!
<EOS>
How
long
it
was
before
I
mastered
the
absorbing
misery
of
my
own
thoughts
,
I
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
I
was
first
conscious
that
she
was
kissing
me
,
and
then
my
eyes
seemed
to
wake
on
a
sudden
to
their
sense
of
outward
things
,
and
I
knew
that
I
was
looking
mechanically
straight
before
me
at
the
prospect
of
the
lake
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
late
,
"
I
heard
her
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
dark
in
the
plantation
.
<EOS>
"
She
shook
my
arm
and
repeated
,
"
Marian
!
<EOS>
it
will
be
dark
in
the
plantation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Give
me
a
minute
longer
,
"
I
said
 
"
a
minute
,
to
get
better
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
to
trust
myself
to
look
at
her
yet
,
and
I
kept
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
view
.
  
<EOS>
It
WAS
late
.
<EOS>
The
dense
brown
line
of
trees
in
the
sky
had
faded
in
the
gathering
darkness
to
the
faint
resemblance
of
a
long
wreath
of
smoke
.
<EOS>
The
mist
over
the
lake
below
had
stealthily
enlarged
,
and
advanced
on
us
.
<EOS>
The
silence
was
as
breathless
as
ever
,
but
the
horror
of
it
had
gone
,
and
the
solemn
mystery
of
its
stillness
was
all
that
remained
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
far
from
the
house
,
"
she
whispered
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
go
back
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
stopped
suddenly
,
and
turned
her
face
from
me
towards
the
entrance
of
the
boat
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Marian
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
trembling
violently
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
see
nothing
?
<EOS>
Look
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
  
"
Down
there
,
below
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
pointed
.
<EOS>
My
eyes
followed
her
hand
,
and
I
saw
it
too
.
  
<EOS>
A
living
figure
was
moving
over
the
waste
of
heath
in
the
distance
.
<EOS>
It
crossed
our
range
of
view
from
the
boat
-
house
,
and
passed
darkly
along
the
outer
edge
of
the
mist
.
<EOS>
It
stopped
far
off
,
in
front
of
us
 
waited
 
and
passed
on
;
moving
slowly
,
with
the
white
cloud
of
mist
behind
it
and
above
it
 
slowly
,
slowly
,
till
it
glided
by
the
edge
of
the
boat
-
house
,
and
we
saw
it
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
both
unnerved
by
what
had
passed
between
us
that
evening
.
<EOS>
Some
minutes
elapsed
before
Laura
would
venture
into
the
plantation
,
and
before
I
could
make
up
my
mind
to
lead
her
back
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
a
man
or
a
woman
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
in
a
whisper
,
as
we
moved
at
last
into
the
dark
dampness
of
the
outer
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
certain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Which
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
looked
like
a
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
afraid
it
was
a
man
in
a
long
cloak
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
a
man
.
<EOS>
In
this
dim
light
it
is
not
possible
to
be
certain
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wait
,
Marian
!
<EOS>
I
'm
frightened
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
the
path
.
<EOS>
Suppose
the
figure
should
follow
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
likely
,
Laura
.
<EOS>
There
is
really
nothing
to
be
alarmed
about
.
<EOS>
The
shores
of
the
lake
are
not
far
from
the
village
,
and
they
are
free
to
any
one
to
walk
on
by
day
or
night
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
wonderful
we
have
seen
no
living
creature
there
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
were
now
in
the
plantation
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
dark
 
<EOS>
so
dark
,
that
we
found
some
difficulty
in
keeping
the
path
.
<EOS>
I
gave
Laura
my
arm
,
and
we
walked
as
fast
as
we
could
on
our
way
back
.
  
<EOS>
Before
we
were
half
-
way
through
she
stopped
,
and
forced
me
to
stop
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
listening
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
"
she
whispered
.
<EOS>
"
I
hear
something
behind
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dead
leaves
,
"
I
said
to
cheer
her
,
"
or
a
twig
blown
off
the
trees
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
summer
time
,
Marian
,
and
there
is
not
a
breath
of
wind
.
<EOS>
Listen
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
heard
the
sound
too
 
a
sound
like
a
light
footstep
following
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
matter
who
it
is
,
or
what
it
is
,
"
I
said
,
"
let
us
walk
on
.
<EOS>
In
another
minute
,
if
there
is
anything
to
alarm
us
,
we
shall
be
near
enough
to
the
house
to
be
heard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
went
on
quickly
 
so
quickly
,
that
Laura
was
breathless
by
the
time
we
were
nearly
through
the
plantation
,
and
within
sight
of
the
lighted
windows
.
  
<EOS>
I
waited
a
moment
to
give
her
breathing
-
time
.
<EOS>
Just
as
we
were
about
to
proceed
she
stopped
me
again
,
and
signed
to
me
with
her
hand
to
listen
once
more
.
<EOS>
We
both
heard
distinctly
a
long
,
heavy
sigh
behind
us
,
in
the
black
depths
of
the
trees
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
there
?
<EOS>
"
I
called
out
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
there
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeated
.
  
<EOS>
An
instant
of
silence
followed
,
and
then
we
heard
the
light
fall
of
the
footsteps
again
,
fainter
and
fainter
 
sinking
away
into
the
darkness
 
sinking
,
sinking
,
sinking
 
till
they
were
lost
in
the
silence
.
  
<EOS>
We
hurried
out
from
the
trees
to
the
open
lawn
beyond
crossed
it
rapidly
;
and
without
another
word
passing
between
us
,
reached
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
light
of
the
hall
-
lamp
Laura
looked
at
me
,
with
white
cheeks
and
startled
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
half
dead
with
fear
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Who
could
it
have
been
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
try
to
guess
to
-
morrow
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
In
the
meantime
say
nothing
to
any
one
of
what
we
have
heard
and
seen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
silence
is
safe
,
and
we
have
need
of
safety
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
sent
Laura
upstairs
immediately
,
waited
a
minute
to
take
off
my
hat
and
put
my
hair
smooth
,
and
then
went
at
once
to
make
my
first
investigations
in
the
library
,
on
pretence
of
searching
for
a
book
.
  
<EOS>
There
sat
the
Count
,
filling
out
the
largest
easy
-
chair
in
the
house
,
smoking
and
reading
calmly
,
with
his
feet
on
an
ottoman
,
his
cravat
across
his
knees
,
and
his
shirt
collar
wide
open
.
<EOS>
And
there
sat
Madame
Fosco
,
like
a
quiet
child
,
on
a
stool
by
his
side
,
making
cigarettes
.
<EOS>
Neither
husband
nor
wife
could
,
by
any
possibility
,
have
been
out
late
that
evening
,
and
have
just
got
back
to
the
house
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
I
felt
that
my
object
in
visiting
the
library
was
answered
the
moment
I
set
eyes
on
them
.
  
<EOS>
Count
Fosco
rose
in
polite
confusion
and
tied
his
cravat
on
when
I
entered
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
let
me
disturb
you
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
come
here
to
get
a
book
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
unfortunate
men
of
my
size
suffer
from
the
heat
,
"
said
the
Count
,
refreshing
himself
gravely
with
a
large
green
fan
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
change
places
with
my
excellent
wife
.
<EOS>
She
is
as
cool
at
this
moment
as
a
fish
in
the
pond
outside
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Countess
allowed
herself
to
thaw
under
the
influence
of
her
husband
's
quaint
comparison
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
never
warm
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
she
remarked
,
with
the
modest
air
of
a
woman
who
was
confessing
to
one
of
her
own
merits
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
and
Lady
Glyde
been
out
this
evening
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
Count
,
while
I
was
taking
a
book
from
the
shelves
to
preserve
appearances
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
we
went
out
to
get
a
little
air
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
in
what
direction
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
direction
of
the
lake
 
as
far
as
the
boat
-
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aha
?
<EOS>
As
far
as
the
boat
-
house
?
"
  
Under
other
circumstances
I
might
have
resented
his
curiosity
.
<EOS>
But
to
-
night
I
hailed
it
as
another
proof
that
neither
he
nor
his
wife
were
connected
with
the
mysterious
appearance
at
the
lake
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
more
adventures
,
I
suppose
,
this
evening
?
<EOS>
"
he
went
on
.
"
<EOS>
No
more
discoveries
,
like
your
discovery
of
the
wounded
dog
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
fixed
his
unfathomable
grey
eyes
on
me
,
with
that
cold
,
clear
,
irresistible
glitter
in
them
which
always
forces
me
to
look
at
him
,
and
always
makes
me
uneasy
while
I
do
look
.
<EOS>
An
unutterable
suspicion
that
his
mind
is
prying
into
mine
overcomes
me
at
these
times
,
and
it
overcame
me
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
I
said
shortly
;
"
no
adventures
 
no
discoveries
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
tried
to
look
away
from
him
and
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
Strange
as
it
seems
,
I
hardly
think
I
should
have
succeeded
in
the
attempt
if
Madame
Fosco
had
not
helped
me
by
causing
him
to
move
and
look
away
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
Count
,
you
are
keeping
Miss
Halcombe
standing
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
The
moment
he
turned
round
to
get
me
a
chair
,
I
seized
my
opportunity
 
<EOS>
thanked
him
 
made
my
excuses
 
and
slipped
out
.
  
<EOS>
An
hour
later
,
when
Laura
's
maid
happened
to
be
in
her
mistress
's
room
,
I
took
occasion
to
refer
to
the
closeness
of
the
night
,
with
a
view
to
ascertaining
next
how
the
servants
had
been
passing
their
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
been
suffering
much
from
the
heat
downstairs
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
miss
,
"
said
the
girl
,
"
we
have
not
felt
it
to
speak
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
out
in
the
woods
then
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Some
of
us
thought
of
going
,
miss
.
<EOS>
But
cook
said
she
should
take
her
chair
into
the
cool
court
-
yard
,
outside
the
kitchen
door
,
and
on
second
thoughts
,
all
the
rest
of
us
took
our
chairs
out
there
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
housekeeper
was
now
the
only
person
who
remained
to
be
accounted
for
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Mrs.
Michelson
gone
to
bed
yet
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
not
,
miss
,
"
said
the
girl
,
smiling
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Michelson
is
more
likely
to
be
getting
up
just
now
than
going
to
bed
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
Has
Mrs.
Michelson
been
taking
to
her
bed
in
the
daytime
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
miss
,
not
exactly
,
but
the
next
thing
to
it
.
<EOS>
She
's
been
asleep
all
the
evening
on
the
sofa
in
her
own
room
.
"
  
<EOS>
Putting
together
what
I
observed
for
myself
in
the
library
,
and
what
I
have
just
heard
from
Laura
's
maid
,
one
conclusion
seems
inevitable
.
<EOS>
The
figure
we
saw
at
the
lake
was
not
the
figure
of
Madame
Fosco
,
of
her
husband
,
or
of
any
of
the
servants
.
<EOS>
The
footsteps
we
heard
behind
us
were
not
the
footsteps
of
any
one
belonging
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Who
could
it
have
been
?
  
<EOS>
It
seems
useless
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
even
decide
whether
the
figure
was
a
man
's
or
a
woman
's
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
that
I
think
it
was
a
woman
's
.
    
<EOS>
June
18th
.
 
<EOS>
The
misery
of
self
-
reproach
which
I
suffered
yesterday
evening
,
on
hearing
what
Laura
told
me
in
the
boat
-
house
,
returned
in
the
loneliness
of
the
night
,
and
kept
me
waking
and
wretched
for
hours
.
  
<EOS>
I
lighted
my
candle
at
last
,
and
searched
through
my
old
journals
to
see
what
my
share
in
the
fatal
error
of
her
marriage
had
really
been
,
and
what
I
might
have
once
done
to
save
her
from
it
.
<EOS>
The
result
soothed
me
a
little
for
it
showed
that
,
however
blindly
and
ignorantly
I
acted
,
I
acted
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
Crying
generally
does
me
harm
;
but
it
was
not
so
<EOS>
last
night
 
I
think
it
relieved
me
.
<EOS>
I
rose
this
morning
with
a
settled
resolution
and
a
quiet
mind
.
<EOS>
Nothing
Sir
Percival
can
say
or
do
shall
ever
irritate
me
again
,
or
make
me
forget
for
one
moment
that
I
am
staying
here
in
defiance
of
mortifications
,
insults
,
and
threats
,
for
Laura
's
service
and
for
Laura
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
The
speculations
in
which
we
might
have
indulged
this
morning
,
on
the
subject
of
the
figure
at
the
lake
and
the
footsteps
in
the
plantation
,
have
been
all
suspended
by
a
trifling
accident
which
has
caused
Laura
great
regret
.
<EOS>
She
has
lost
the
little
brooch
I
gave
her
for
a
keepsake
on
the
day
before
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
As
she
wore
it
when
we
went
out
yesterday
evening
we
can
only
suppose
that
it
must
have
dropped
from
her
dress
,
either
in
the
boat
-
house
or
on
our
way
back
.
<EOS>
The
servants
have
been
sent
to
search
,
and
have
returned
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
And
now
Laura
herself
has
gone
to
look
for
it
.
<EOS>
Whether
she
finds
it
or
not
the
loss
will
help
to
excuse
her
absence
from
the
house
,
if
Sir
Percival
returns
before
the
letter
from
Mr.
Gilmore
's
partner
is
placed
in
my
hands
.
  
<EOS>
One
o'clock
has
just
struck
.
<EOS>
I
am
considering
whether
I
had
better
wait
here
for
the
arrival
of
the
messenger
from
London
,
or
slip
away
quietly
,
and
watch
for
him
outside
the
lodge
gate
.
  
<EOS>
My
suspicion
of
everybody
and
everything
in
this
house
inclines
me
to
think
that
the
second
plan
may
be
the
best
.
<EOS>
The
Count
is
safe
in
the
breakfast
-
room
.
<EOS>
I
heard
him
,
through
the
door
,
as
I
ran
upstairs
ten
minutes
since
,
exercising
his
canary
-
birds
at
their
tricks
:
 
<EOS>
"
Come
out
on
my
little
finger
,
my
pret
-
pret
-
pretties
!
<EOS>
Come
out
,
and
hop
upstairs
!
<EOS>
One
,
two
,
three
 
and
up
!
<EOS>
Three
,
two
,
one
 
and
down
!
<EOS>
One
,
two
,
three
 
twit
-
twit
-
twit
-
tweet
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
birds
burst
into
their
usual
ecstasy
of
singing
,
and
the
Count
chirruped
and
whistled
at
them
in
return
,
as
if
he
was
a
bird
himself
.
<EOS>
My
room
door
is
open
,
and
I
can
hear
the
shrill
singing
and
whistling
at
this
very
moment
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
really
to
slip
out
without
being
observed
,
now
is
my
time
.
  
<EOS>
FOUR
<EOS>
O'CLOCK
.
<EOS>
The
three
hours
that
have
passed
since
I
made
my
last
entry
have
turned
the
whole
march
of
events
at
Blackwater
Park
in
a
new
direction
.
<EOS>
Whether
for
good
or
for
evil
,
I
can
not
and
dare
not
decide
.
  
<EOS>
Let
me
get
back
first
to
the
place
at
which
I
left
off
,
or
I
shall
lose
myself
in
the
confusion
of
my
own
thoughts
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
out
,
as
I
had
proposed
,
to
meet
the
messenger
with
my
letter
from
London
at
the
lodge
gate
.
<EOS>
On
the
stairs
I
saw
no
one
.
<EOS>
In
the
hall
I
heard
the
Count
still
exercising
his
birds
.
<EOS>
But
on
crossing
the
quadrangle
outside
,
I
passed
Madame
Fosco
,
walking
by
herself
in
her
favourite
circle
,
round
and
round
the
great
fish
-
pond
.
<EOS>
I
at
once
slackened
my
pace
,
so
as
to
avoid
all
appearance
of
being
in
a
hurry
,
and
even
went
the
length
,
for
caution
's
sake
,
of
inquiring
if
she
thought
of
going
out
before
lunch
.
<EOS>
She
smiled
at
me
in
the
friendliest
manner
 
<EOS>
said
she
preferred
remaining
near
the
house
,
nodded
pleasantly
,
and
re
-
entered
the
hall
.
<EOS>
I
looked
back
,
and
saw
that
she
had
closed
the
door
before
I
had
opened
the
wicket
by
the
side
of
the
carriage
gates
.
  
<EOS>
In
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
I
reached
the
lodge
.
  
<EOS>
The
lane
outside
took
a
sudden
turn
to
the
left
,
ran
on
straight
for
a
hundred
yards
or
so
,
and
then
took
another
sharp
turn
to
the
right
to
join
the
high
-
road
.
<EOS>
Between
these
two
turns
,
hidden
from
the
lodge
on
one
side
,
and
from
the
way
to
the
station
on
the
other
,
I
waited
,
walking
backwards
and
forwards
.
<EOS>
High
hedges
were
on
either
side
of
me
,
and
for
twenty
minutes
,
by
my
watch
,
I
neither
saw
nor
heard
anything
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
that
time
the
sound
of
a
carriage
caught
my
ear
,
and
I
was
met
,
as
I
advanced
towards
the
second
turning
,
by
a
fly
from
the
railway
.
<EOS>
I
made
a
sign
to
the
driver
to
stop
.
<EOS>
As
he
obeyed
me
a
respectable
-
looking
man
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
to
see
what
was
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
I
said
,
"
but
am
I
right
in
supposing
that
you
are
going
to
Blackwater
Park
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
a
letter
for
any
one
?
"
  
"
With
a
letter
for
Miss
Halcombe
,
ma'am
.
"
  
"
You
may
give
me
the
letter
.
<EOS>
I
am
Miss
Halcombe
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
touched
his
hat
,
got
out
of
the
fly
immediately
,
and
gave
me
the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
I
opened
it
at
once
and
read
these
lines
.
<EOS>
I
copy
them
here
,
thinking
it
best
to
destroy
the
original
for
caution
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
"
DEAR
MADAM
,
 
Your
letter
received
this
morning
has
caused
me
very
great
anxiety
.
<EOS>
I
will
reply
to
it
as
briefly
and
plainly
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
careful
consideration
of
the
statement
made
by
yourself
,
and
my
knowledge
of
Lady
Glyde
's
position
,
as
defined
in
the
settlement
,
lead
me
,
I
regret
to
say
,
to
the
conclusion
that
a
loan
of
the
trust
money
to
Sir
Percival
(
or
,
in
other
words
,
a
loan
of
some
portion
of
the
twenty
thousand
pounds
of
Lady
Glyde
's
fortune
)
is
in
contemplation
,
and
that
she
is
made
a
party
to
the
deed
,
in
order
to
secure
her
approval
of
a
flagrant
breach
of
trust
,
and
to
have
her
signature
produced
against
her
if
she
should
complain
hereafter
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
,
on
any
other
supposition
,
to
account
,
situated
as
she
is
,
for
her
execution
to
a
deed
of
any
kind
being
wanted
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
event
of
Lady
Glyde
's
signing
such
a
document
,
as
I
am
compelled
to
suppose
the
deed
in
question
to
be
,
her
trustees
would
be
at
liberty
to
advance
money
to
Sir
Percival
out
of
her
twenty
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
If
the
amount
so
lent
should
not
be
paid
back
,
and
if
Lady
Glyde
should
have
children
,
their
fortune
will
then
be
diminished
by
the
sum
,
large
or
small
,
so
advanced
.
<EOS>
In
plainer
terms
still
,
the
transaction
,
for
anything
that
Lady
Glyde
knows
to
the
contrary
,
may
be
a
fraud
upon
her
unborn
children
.
  
<EOS>
"
Under
these
serious
circumstances
,
I
would
recommend
Lady
Glyde
to
assign
as
a
reason
for
withholding
her
signature
,
that
she
wishes
the
deed
to
be
first
submitted
to
myself
,
as
her
family
solicitor
(
in
the
absence
of
my
partner
,
Mr.
Gilmore
)
.
<EOS>
No
reasonable
objection
can
be
made
to
taking
this
course
 
for
,
if
the
transaction
is
an
honourable
one
,
there
will
necessarily
be
no
difficulty
in
my
giving
my
approval
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sincerely
assuring
you
of
my
readiness
to
afford
any
additional
help
or
advice
that
may
be
wanted
,
I
beg
to
remain
,
Madam
,
your
faithful
servant
,
  
"
WILLIAM
KYRLE
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
read
this
kind
and
sensible
letter
very
thankfully
.
<EOS>
It
supplied
Laura
with
a
reason
for
objecting
to
the
signature
which
was
unanswerable
,
and
which
we
could
both
of
us
understand
.
<EOS>
The
messenger
waited
near
me
while
I
was
reading
to
receive
his
directions
when
I
had
done
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
be
good
enough
to
say
that
I
understand
the
letter
,
and
that
I
am
very
much
obliged
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
other
reply
necessary
at
present
.
"
  
<EOS>
Exactly
at
the
moment
when
I
was
speaking
those
words
,
holding
the
letter
open
in
my
hand
,
Count
Fosco
turned
the
corner
of
the
lane
from
the
high
-
road
,
and
stood
before
me
as
if
he
had
sprung
up
out
of
the
earth
.
  
<EOS>
The
suddenness
of
his
appearance
,
in
the
very
last
place
under
heaven
in
which
I
should
have
expected
to
see
him
,
took
me
completely
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
The
messenger
wished
me
good
-
morning
,
and
got
into
the
fly
again
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
say
a
word
to
him
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
even
able
to
return
his
bow
.
<EOS>
The
conviction
that
I
was
discovered
 
and
by
that
man
,
of
all
others
 
absolutely
petrified
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
back
to
the
house
,
Miss
Halcombe
?
<EOS>
"
he
inquired
,
without
showing
the
least
surprise
on
his
side
,
and
without
even
looking
after
the
fly
,
which
drove
off
while
he
was
speaking
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
collected
myself
sufficiently
to
make
a
sign
in
the
affirmative
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
back
too
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
allow
me
the
pleasure
of
accompanying
you
.
<EOS>
Will
you
take
my
arm
?
<EOS>
You
look
surprised
at
seeing
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
took
his
arm
.
<EOS>
The
first
of
my
scattered
senses
that
came
back
was
the
sense
that
warned
me
to
sacrifice
anything
rather
than
make
an
enemy
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
look
surprised
at
seeing
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
repeated
in
his
quietly
pertinacious
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
,
Count
,
I
heard
you
with
your
birds
in
the
breakfast
-
room
,
"
I
answered
,
as
quietly
and
firmly
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
.
<EOS>
But
my
little
feathered
children
,
dear
lady
,
are
only
too
like
other
children
.
<EOS>
They
have
their
days
of
perversity
,
and
this
morning
was
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
My
wife
came
in
as
I
was
putting
them
back
in
their
cage
,
and
said
she
had
left
you
going
out
alone
for
a
walk
.
<EOS>
You
told
her
so
,
did
you
not
?
"
  
"
Certainly
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
the
pleasure
of
accompanying
you
was
too
great
<EOS>
a
temptation
for
me
to
resist
.
<EOS>
At
my
age
there
is
no
harm
in
confessing
so
much
as
that
,
is
there
?
<EOS>
I
seized
my
hat
,
and
set
off
to
offer
myself
as
your
escort
.
<EOS>
Even
so
fat
an
old
man
as
Fosco
is
surely
better
than
no
escort
at
all
?
<EOS>
I
took
the
wrong
path
 
<EOS>
I
came
back
in
despair
,
and
here
I
am
,
arrived
(
may
I
say
it
?
)
<EOS>
at
the
height
of
my
wishes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
talked
on
in
this
complimentary
strain
with
a
fluency
which
left
me
no
exertion
to
make
beyond
the
effort
of
maintaining
my
composure
.
<EOS>
He
never
referred
in
the
most
distant
manner
to
what
he
had
seen
in
the
lane
,
or
to
the
letter
which
I
still
had
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
This
ominous
discretion
helped
to
convince
me
that
he
must
have
surprised
,
by
the
most
dishonourable
means
,
the
secret
of
my
application
in
Laura
's
interest
to
the
lawyer
;
and
that
,
having
now
assured
himself
of
the
private
manner
in
which
I
had
received
the
answer
,
he
had
discovered
enough
to
suit
his
purposes
,
and
was
only
bent
on
trying
to
quiet
the
suspicions
which
he
knew
he
must
have
aroused
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
was
wise
enough
,
under
these
circumstances
,
not
to
attempt
to
deceive
him
by
plausible
explanations
,
and
woman
enough
,
notwithstanding
my
dread
of
him
,
to
feel
as
if
my
hand
was
tainted
by
resting
on
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
drive
in
front
of
the
house
we
met
the
dog
-
cart
being
taken
round
to
the
stables
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
had
just
returned
.
<EOS>
He
came
out
to
meet
us
at
the
house
-
door
.
<EOS>
Whatever
other
results
his
journey
might
have
had
,
it
had
not
ended
in
softening
his
savage
temper
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
here
are
<EOS>
two
of
you
come
back
,
"
he
said
,
with
a
lowering
face
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
meaning
of
the
house
being
deserted
in
this
way
?
<EOS>
Where
is
Lady
Glyde
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
told
him
of
the
loss
of
the
brooch
,
and
said
that
Laura
had
gone
into
the
plantation
to
look
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Brooch
or
no
brooch
,
"
he
growled
sulkily
,
"
I
recommend
her
not
to
forget
her
appointment
in
the
library
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
I
shall
expect
to
see
her
in
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
took
my
hand
from
the
Count
's
arm
,
and
slowly
ascended
the
steps
.
<EOS>
He
honoured
me
with
one
of
his
magnificent
bows
,
and
then
addressed
himself
gaily
to
the
scowling
master
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
,
Percival
,
"
he
said
,
"
have
you
had
a
pleasant
drive
?
<EOS>
And
has
your
pretty
shining
Brown
Molly
come
back
at
all
tired
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Brown
Molly
be
hanged
 
and
the
drive
too
!
<EOS>
I
want
my
lunch
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
want
five
minutes
'
talk
with
you
,
Percival
,
first
,
"
returned
the
Count
.
"
<EOS>
Five
minutes
'
talk
,
my
friend
,
here
on
the
grass
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
about
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
About
business
that
very
much
concerns
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
lingered
long
enough
in
passing
through
the
hall
-
door
to
hear
this
question
and
answer
,
and
to
see
Sir
Percival
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
in
sullen
hesitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
want
to
badger
me
with
any
more
of
your
infernal
scruples
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
for
one
wo
n't
hear
them
.
<EOS>
I
want
my
lunch
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
out
here
and
speak
to
me
,
"
repeated
the
Count
,
still
perfectly
uninfluenced
by
the
rudest
speech
that
his
friend
could
make
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
descended
the
steps
.
<EOS>
The
Count
took
him
by
the
arm
,
and
walked
him
away
gently
.
<EOS>
The
"
business
,
"
I
was
sure
,
referred
to
the
question
of
the
signature
.
<EOS>
They
were
speaking
of
Laura
and
of
me
beyond
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
felt
heart
-
sick
and
faint
with
anxiety
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
of
the
last
importance
to
both
of
us
to
know
what
they
were
saying
to
each
other
at
that
moment
,
and
not
one
word
of
it
could
by
any
possibility
reach
my
ears
.
  
<EOS>
I
walked
about
the
house
,
from
room
to
room
,
with
the
lawyer
's
letter
in
my
bosom
<EOS>
(
I
was
afraid
by
this
time
even
to
trust
it
under
lock
and
key
)
,
till
the
oppression
of
my
suspense
<EOS>
half
maddened
me
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
signs
of
Laura
's
return
,
and
I
thought
of
going
out
to
look
for
her
.
<EOS>
But
my
strength
was
so
exhausted
by
the
trials
and
anxieties
of
the
morning
that
the
heat
of
the
day
quite
overpowered
me
,
and
after
an
attempt
to
get
to
the
door
I
was
obliged
to
return
to
the
drawing
-
room
and
lie
down
on
the
nearest
sofa
to
recover
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
just
composing
myself
when
the
door
opened
softly
and
the
Count
looked
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
thousand
pardons
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
he
said
;
"
<EOS>
I
only
venture
to
disturb
you
because
I
am
the
bearer
of
good
news
.
<EOS>
Percival
 
who
is
capricious
in
everything
,
as
you
know
 
has
seen
fit
to
alter
his
mind
at
the
last
moment
,
and
the
business
of
the
signature
is
put
off
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
A
great
relief
to
all
of
us
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
as
I
see
with
pleasure
in
your
face
.
<EOS>
Pray
present
my
best
respects
and
felicitations
,
when
you
mention
this
pleasant
change
of
circumstances
to
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
left
me
before
I
had
recovered
my
astonishment
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
doubt
that
this
extraordinary
alteration
of
purpose
in
the
matter
of
the
signature
was
due
to
his
influence
,
and
that
his
discovery
of
my
application
to
London
yesterday
,
and
of
my
having
received
an
answer
to
it
to
-
day
,
had
offered
him
the
means
of
interfering
with
certain
success
.
  
<EOS>
I
felt
these
impressions
,
but
my
mind
seemed
to
share
the
exhaustion
of
my
body
,
and
I
was
in
no
condition
to
dwell
on
them
with
any
useful
reference
to
the
doubtful
present
or
the
threatening
future
.
<EOS>
I
tried
a
second
time
to
run
out
and
find
Laura
,
but
my
head
was
giddy
and
my
knees
trembled
under
me
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
choice
but
to
give
it
up
again
and
return
to
the
sofa
,
sorely
against
my
will
.
  
<EOS>
The
quiet
in
the
house
,
and
the
low
murmuring
hum
of
summer
insects
outside
the
open
window
,
soothed
me
.
<EOS>
My
eyes
closed
of
themselves
,
and
I
passed
gradually
into
a
strange
condition
,
which
was
not
waking
 
for
I
knew
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
about
me
,
and
not
sleeping
 
for
I
was
conscious
of
my
own
repose
.
<EOS>
In
this
state
my
fevered
mind
broke
loose
from
me
,
while
my
weary
body
was
at
rest
,
and
in
a
trance
,
or
day
-
dream
of
my
fancy
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
call
it
 
<EOS>
I
saw
Walter
Hartright
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
thought
of
him
since
I
rose
<EOS>
that
morning
 
Laura
had
not
said
one
word
to
me
either
directly
or
indirectly
referring
to
him
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
saw
him
now
as
plainly
as
if
the
past
time
had
returned
,
and
we
were
both
together
again
at
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
He
appeared
to
me
as
one
among
many
other
men
,
none
of
whose
faces
I
could
plainly
discern
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
lying
on
the
steps
of
an
immense
ruined
temple
.
<EOS>
Colossal
tropical
trees
 
with
rank
creepers
twining
endlessly
about
their
trunks
,
and
hideous
stone
idols
glimmering
and
grinning
at
intervals
behind
leaves
and
stalks
and
branches
 
surrounded
the
temple
and
shut
out
the
sky
,
and
threw
a
dismal
shadow
over
the
forlorn
band
of
men
on
the
steps
.
<EOS>
White
exhalations
twisted
and
curled
up
stealthily
from
the
ground
,
approached
the
men
in
wreaths
like
smoke
,
touched
them
,
and
stretched
them
out
dead
,
one
by
one
,
in
the
places
where
they
lay
.
<EOS>
An
agony
of
pity
and
fear
for
Walter
loosened
my
tongue
,
and
I
implored
him
to
escape
.
<EOS>
"
Come
back
,
come
back
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Remember
your
promise
to
HER
and
to
ME
.
<EOS>
Come
back
to
us
before
the
Pestilence
reaches
you
and
lays
you
dead
like
the
rest
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
me
with
an
unearthly
quiet
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
Wait
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
shall
come
back
.
<EOS>
The
night
when
I
met
the
lost
Woman
on
the
highway
was
the
night
which
set
my
life
apart
to
be
the
instrument
of
a
Design
that
is
yet
unseen
.
<EOS>
Here
,
lost
in
the
wilderness
,
or
there
,
welcomed
back
in
the
land
of
my
birth
,
I
am
still
walking
on
the
dark
road
which
leads
me
,
and
you
,
and
the
sister
of
your
love
and
mine
,
to
the
unknown
Retribution
and
the
inevitable
End
.
<EOS>
Wait
and
look
.
<EOS>
The
Pestilence
which
touches
the
rest
will
pass
ME
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
saw
him
again
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
in
the
forest
,
and
the
numbers
of
his
lost
companions
had
dwindled
to
very
few
.
<EOS>
The
temple
was
gone
,
and
the
idols
were
gone
 
and
in
their
place
the
figures
of
dark
,
dwarfish
men
lurked
murderously
among
the
trees
,
with
bows
in
their
hands
,
and
arrows
fitted
to
the
string
.
<EOS>
Once
more
I
feared
for
Walter
,
and
cried
out
to
warn
him
.
<EOS>
Once
more
he
turned
to
me
,
with
the
immovable
quiet
in
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Another
step
,
"
he
said
,
"
on
the
dark
road
.
<EOS>
Wait
and
look
.
<EOS>
The
arrows
that
strike
the
rest
will
spare
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
saw
him
for
the
third
time
in
a
wrecked
ship
,
stranded
on
a
wild
,
sandy
shore
.
<EOS>
The
overloaded
boats
were
making
away
from
him
for
the
land
,
and
he
alone
was
left
to
sink
with
the
ship
.
<EOS>
I
cried
to
him
to
hail
the
hindmost
boat
,
and
to
make
a
last
effort
for
his
life
.
<EOS>
The
quiet
face
looked
at
me
in
return
,
and
the
unmoved
voice
gave
me
back
the
changeless
reply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Another
step
on
the
journey
.
<EOS>
Wait
and
look
.
<EOS>
The
Sea
which
drowns
the
rest
will
spare
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
saw
him
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
He
was
kneeling
by
a
tomb
of
white
marble
,
and
the
shadow
of
a
veiled
woman
rose
out
of
the
grave
beneath
and
waited
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
The
unearthly
quiet
of
his
face
had
changed
to
an
unearthly
sorrow
.
<EOS>
But
the
terrible
certainty
of
his
words
remained
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Darker
and
darker
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
;
"
farther
and
farther
yet
.
<EOS>
Death
takes
the
good
,
the
beautiful
,
and
the
young
 
and
spares
me
.
<EOS>
The
Pestilence
that
wastes
,
the
Arrow
that
strikes
,
the
Sea
that
drowns
,
the
Grave
that
closes
over
Love
and
Hope
,
are
steps
of
my
journey
,
and
take
me
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
End
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
heart
sank
under
a
dread
beyond
words
,
under
a
grief
beyond
tears
.
<EOS>
The
darkness
closed
round
the
pilgrim
at
the
marble
tomb
 
<EOS>
closed
round
<EOS>
the
veiled
woman
from
the
grave
 
closed
round
the
dreamer
who
looked
on
them
.
<EOS>
I
saw
and
heard
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
aroused
by
a
hand
laid
on
my
shoulder
.
<EOS>
It
was
Laura
's
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
dropped
on
her
knees
by
the
side
of
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
Her
face
was
flushed
and
agitated
,
and
her
eyes
met
mine
in
a
wild
bewildered
manner
.
<EOS>
I
started
the
instant
I
saw
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
has
happened
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
What
has
frightened
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
round
at
the
half
-
open
door
,
put
her
lips
close
to
my
ear
,
and
answered
in
a
whisper
    
"
Marian
!
 
<EOS>
the
figure
at
the
lake
 
<EOS>
the
footsteps
last
night
 
<EOS>
I
've
just
seen
her
!
<EOS>
I
've
just
spoken
to
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
?
"
  
"
Anne
Catherick
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
so
startled
by
the
disturbance
in
Laura
's
face
and
manner
,
and
so
dismayed
by
the
first
waking
impressions
of
my
dream
,
<EOS>
that
I
was
not
fit
to
bear
the
revelation
which
burst
upon
me
when
that
name
passed
her
lips
.
<EOS>
I
could
only
stand
rooted
to
the
floor
,
looking
at
her
in
breathless
silence
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
too
much
absorbed
by
what
had
happened
to
notice
the
effect
which
her
reply
had
produced
on
me
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
Anne
Catherick
!
<EOS>
I
have
spoken
to
Anne
Catherick
!
"
<EOS>
she
repeated
as
if
I
had
not
heard
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Marian
,
I
have
such
things
to
tell
you
!
<EOS>
Come
away
 
we
may
be
interrupted
here
 
<EOS>
come
at
once
into
my
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
those
eager
words
she
caught
me
by
the
hand
,
and
led
me
through
the
library
,
to
the
end
room
on
the
ground
floor
,
which
had
been
fitted
up
for
her
own
especial
use
.
<EOS>
No
third
person
,
except
her
maid
,
could
have
any
excuse
for
surprising
us
here
.
<EOS>
She
pushed
me
in
before
her
,
locked
the
door
,
and
drew
the
chintz
curtains
that
hung
over
the
inside
.
  
<EOS>
The
strange
,
stunned
feeling
which
had
taken
possession
of
me
still
remained
.
<EOS>
But
a
growing
conviction
that
the
complications
which
had
long
threatened
to
gather
about
her
,
and
to
gather
about
me
,
had
suddenly
closed
fast
round
us
both
,
was
now
beginning
to
penetrate
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
express
it
in
words
 
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
even
realise
it
dimly
in
my
own
thoughts
.
<EOS>
"
Anne
Catherick
!
<EOS>
"
I
whispered
to
myself
,
with
useless
,
helpless
reiteration
 
"
Anne
Catherick
!
"
  
<EOS>
Laura
drew
me
to
the
nearest
seat
,
an
ottoman
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
Look
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
look
here
!
"
 
and
pointed
to
the
bosom
of
her
dress
.
  
<EOS>
I
saw
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
the
lost
brooch
was
pinned
in
its
place
again
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
real
in
the
sight
of
it
,
something
real
in
the
touching
of
it
afterwards
,
which
seemed
to
steady
the
whirl
and
confusion
in
my
thoughts
,
and
to
help
me
to
compose
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
did
you
find
your
brooch
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
first
words
I
could
say
to
her
were
the
words
which
put
that
trivial
question
at
that
important
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
SHE
found
it
,
Marian
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
  
"
On
the
floor
of
the
boat
-
house
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
shall
I
begin
 
how
shall
I
tell
you
about
it
!
<EOS>
She
talked
to
me
so
strangely
 
<EOS>
she
looked
so
fearfully
ill
 
<EOS>
she
left
me
so
suddenly
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
voice
rose
as
the
tumult
of
her
recollections
pressed
upon
her
mind
.
<EOS>
The
inveterate
distrust
which
weighs
,
night
and
day
,
on
my
spirits
in
this
house
,
instantly
roused
me
to
warn
her
 
just
as
the
sight
of
the
brooch
had
roused
me
to
question
her
,
the
moment
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Speak
low
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
The
window
is
open
,
and
the
garden
path
runs
beneath
it
.
<EOS>
Begin
at
the
beginning
,
Laura
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
word
for
word
,
what
passed
between
that
woman
and
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
close
the
window
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
only
speak
low
 
only
remember
that
Anne
Catherick
is
a
dangerous
subject
under
your
husband
's
roof
.
<EOS>
Where
did
you
first
see
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
the
boat
-
house
,
Marian
.
<EOS>
I
went
out
,
as
you
know
,
to
find
my
brooch
,
and
I
walked
along
the
path
through
the
plantation
,
looking
down
on
the
ground
carefully
at
every
step
.
<EOS>
In
that
way
I
got
on
,
after
a
long
time
,
to
the
boat
-
house
,
and
as
soon
as
I
was
inside
it
,
I
went
on
my
knees
to
hunt
over
the
floor
.
<EOS>
I
was
still
searching
with
my
back
to
the
doorway
,
when
I
heard
a
soft
,
strange
voice
behind
me
say
,
"
Miss
Fairlie
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Miss
Fairlie
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
old
name
 
<EOS>
the
dear
,
familiar
name
that
I
thought
I
had
parted
from
for
ever
.
<EOS>
I
started
up
 
not
frightened
,
the
voice
was
too
kind
and
gentle
to
frighten
anybody
 
but
very
much
surprised
.
<EOS>
There
,
looking
at
me
from
the
doorway
,
stood
a
woman
,
whose
face
I
never
remembered
to
have
seen
before
 
"
  
"
How
was
she
dressed
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
had
a
neat
,
pretty
white
gown
on
,
and
over
it
a
poor
worn
thin
dark
shawl
.
<EOS>
Her
bonnet
was
of
brown
straw
,
as
poor
and
worn
as
the
shawl
.
<EOS>
I
was
struck
by
the
difference
between
her
gown
and
the
rest
of
her
dress
,
and
she
saw
that
I
noticed
it
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
look
at
my
bonnet
and
shawl
,
"
she
said
,
speaking
in
a
quick
,
breathless
,
sudden
way
;
"
if
I
must
n't
wear
white
,
I
do
n't
care
what
I
wear
.
<EOS>
Look
at
my
gown
as
much
as
you
please
 
<EOS>
I
'm
not
ashamed
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
strange
,
was
it
not
?
<EOS>
Before
I
could
say
anything
to
soothe
her
,
she
held
out
one
of
her
hands
,
and
I
saw
my
brooch
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
pleased
and
so
grateful
,
that
I
went
quite
close
to
her
to
say
what
I
really
felt
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
thankful
enough
to
do
me
one
little
kindness
?
"
she
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
,
"
I
answered
,
"
any
kindness
in
my
power
I
shall
be
glad
to
show
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
Then
let
me
pin
your
brooch
on
for
you
,
now
I
have
found
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
request
was
so
unexpected
,
Marian
,
and
she
made
it
with
such
extraordinary
eagerness
,
that
I
drew
back
a
step
or
two
,
not
well
knowing
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
your
mother
would
have
let
me
pin
on
the
brooch
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
something
in
her
voice
and
her
look
,
as
well
as
in
her
mentioning
my
mother
in
that
reproachful
manner
,
which
made
me
ashamed
of
my
distrust
.
<EOS>
I
took
her
hand
with
the
brooch
in
it
,
and
put
it
up
gently
on
the
bosom
of
my
dress
.
<EOS>
"
You
knew
my
mother
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Was
it
very
long
ago
?
<EOS>
have
I
ever
seen
you
before
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
hands
were
busy
fastening
the
brooch
:
she
stopped
and
pressed
them
against
my
breast
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
remember
a
fine
spring
day
at
Limmeridge
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
your
mother
walking
down
the
path
that
led
to
the
school
,
with
a
little
girl
on
each
side
of
her
?
<EOS>
I
have
had
nothing
else
to
think
of
since
,
and
I
remember
it
.
<EOS>
You
were
one
of
the
little
girls
,
and
I
was
the
other
.
<EOS>
Pretty
,
clever
Miss
Fairlie
,
and
poor
dazed
Anne
Catherick
were
nearer
to
each
other
then
than
they
are
now
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Did
you
remember
her
,
Laura
,
when
she
told
you
her
name
?
"
  
"
Yes
,
I
remembered
your
asking
me
about
Anne
Catherick
at
Limmeridge
,
and
your
saying
that
she
had
once
been
considered
like
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
reminded
you
of
that
,
Laura
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
SHE
reminded
me
.
<EOS>
While
I
was
looking
at
her
,
while
she
was
very
close
to
me
,
it
came
over
my
mind
suddenly
that
we
were
like
each
other
!
<EOS>
Her
face
was
pale
and
thin
and
weary
 
but
the
sight
of
it
startled
me
,
as
if
it
had
been
the
sight
of
my
own
face
in
the
glass
after
a
long
illness
.
<EOS>
The
discovery
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
 
gave
me
such
a
shock
,
that
I
was
perfectly
incapable
of
speaking
to
her
for
the
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
she
seem
hurt
by
your
silence
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
she
was
hurt
by
it
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
got
your
mother
's
face
,
"
she
said
,
"
or
your
mother
's
heart
.
<EOS>
Your
mother
's
face
was
dark
,
and
your
mother
's
heart
,
Miss
Fairlie
,
was
the
heart
of
an
angel
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
feel
kindly
towards
you
,
"
I
said
,
"
though
I
may
not
be
able
to
express
it
as
I
ought
.
<EOS>
Why
do
you
call
me
Miss
Fairlie
?
 
"
"
Because
I
love
the
name
of
Fairlie
and
hate
the
name
of
Glyde
,
"
she
broke
out
violently
.
<EOS>
I
had
seen
nothing
like
madness
in
her
before
this
,
but
I
fancied
I
saw
it
now
in
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
thought
you
might
not
know
I
was
married
,
"
I
said
,
remembering
the
wild
letter
she
wrote
to
me
at
Limmeridge
,
and
trying
to
quiet
her
.
<EOS>
She
sighed
bitterly
,
and
turned
away
from
me
.
"
<EOS>
Not
know
you
were
married
?
<EOS>
"
she
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
here
BECAUSE
you
are
married
.
<EOS>
I
am
here
to
make
atonement
to
you
,
before
I
meet
your
mother
in
the
world
beyond
the
grave
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
drew
farther
and
farther
away
from
me
,
till
she
was
out
of
the
boat
-
house
,
and
then
she
watched
and
listened
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
When
she
turned
round
to
speak
again
,
instead
of
coming
back
,
she
stopped
where
she
was
,
looking
in
at
me
,
with
a
hand
on
each
side
of
the
entrance
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
see
me
at
the
lake
last
night
?
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
hear
me
following
you
in
the
wood
?
<EOS>
I
have
been
waiting
for
days
together
to
speak
to
you
alone
 
<EOS>
I
have
left
the
only
friend
I
have
in
the
world
,
anxious
and
frightened
about
me
 
I
have
risked
being
shut
up
again
in
the
mad
-
house
 
and
all
for
your
sake
,
Miss
Fairlie
,
all
for
your
sake
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
words
alarmed
me
,
Marian
,
and
yet
there
was
something
in
the
way
she
spoke
that
made
me
pity
her
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
my
pity
must
have
been
sincere
,
for
it
made
me
bold
enough
to
ask
the
poor
creature
to
come
in
,
and
sit
down
in
the
boat
-
house
,
by
my
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
she
do
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
,
and
told
me
she
must
stop
where
she
was
,
to
watch
and
listen
,
and
see
that
no
third
person
surprised
us
.
<EOS>
And
from
first
to
last
,
there
she
waited
at
the
entrance
,
with
a
hand
on
each
side
of
it
,
sometimes
bending
in
suddenly
to
speak
to
me
,
sometimes
drawing
back
suddenly
to
look
about
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
here
yesterday
,
"
she
said
,
"
before
it
came
dark
,
and
I
heard
you
,
and
the
lady
with
you
,
talking
together
.
<EOS>
I
heard
you
tell
her
about
your
husband
.
<EOS>
I
heard
you
say
you
had
no
influence
to
make
him
believe
you
,
and
no
influence
to
keep
him
silent
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
knew
what
those
words
meant
 
my
conscience
told
me
while
I
was
listening
.
<EOS>
Why
did
I
ever
let
you
marry
him
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
fear
 
my
mad
,
miserable
,
wicked
fear
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
covered
up
her
face
in
her
poor
worn
shawl
,
and
moaned
and
murmured
to
herself
behind
it
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
be
afraid
she
might
break
out
into
some
terrible
despair
which
neither
she
nor
I
could
master
.
<EOS>
"
Try
to
quiet
yourself
,
"
I
said
;
"
try
to
tell
me
how
you
might
have
prevented
my
marriage
.
"
<EOS>
She
took
the
shawl
from
her
face
,
and
looked
at
me
vacantly
.
<EOS>
"
I
ought
to
have
had
heart
enough
to
stop
at
Limmeridge
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
ought
never
to
have
let
the
news
of
his
coming
there
frighten
me
away
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
warned
you
and
saved
you
before
it
was
too
late
.
<EOS>
Why
did
I
only
have
courage
enough
to
write
you
that
letter
?
<EOS>
Why
did
I
only
do
harm
,
when
I
wanted
and
meant
to
do
good
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
fear
 
<EOS>
my
mad
,
miserable
,
wicked
fear
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
repeated
those
words
again
,
and
hid
her
face
again
in
the
end
of
her
poor
worn
shawl
.
<EOS>
It
was
dreadful
to
see
her
,
and
dreadful
to
hear
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
Laura
,
you
asked
what
the
fear
was
which
she
dwelt
on
so
earnestly
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
asked
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
she
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
asked
me
in
return
,
if
I
should
not
be
afraid
of
a
man
who
had
shut
me
up
in
a
mad
-
house
,
and
who
would
shut
me
up
again
,
if
he
could
?
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
Are
you
afraid
still
?
<EOS>
Surely
you
would
not
be
here
if
you
were
afraid
now
?
"
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
am
not
afraid
now
.
<EOS>
"
I
asked
why
not
.
<EOS>
She
suddenly
bent
forward
into
the
boat
-
house
,
and
said
,
"
Ca
n't
you
guess
why
?
<EOS>
"
I
shook
my
head
.
<EOS>
"
Look
at
me
,
"
she
went
on
.
<EOS>
I
told
her
I
was
grieved
to
see
that
she
looked
very
sorrowful
and
very
ill
.
<EOS>
She
smiled
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
"
Ill
?
"
<EOS>
she
repeated
;
"
I
'm
dying
.
<EOS>
You
know
why
I
'm
not
afraid
of
him
now
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
shall
meet
your
mother
in
heaven
?
<EOS>
Will
she
forgive
me
if
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
I
was
so
shocked
and
so
startled
,
that
I
could
make
no
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
thinking
of
it
,
"
she
went
on
,
"
all
the
time
I
have
been
in
hiding
from
your
husband
,
all
the
time
I
lay
ill
.
<EOS>
My
thoughts
have
driven
me
here
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
make
atonement
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
undo
all
I
can
of
the
harm
I
once
did
.
<EOS>
"
I
begged
her
as
earnestly
as
I
could
to
tell
me
what
she
meant
.
<EOS>
She
still
looked
at
me
with
fixed
vacant
eyes
.
"
<EOS>
SHALL
I
undo
the
harm
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
to
herself
doubtfully
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
friends
to
take
your
part
.
<EOS>
If
YOU
know
his
Secret
,
he
will
be
afraid
of
you
,
he
wo
n't
dare
use
you
as
he
used
me
.
<EOS>
He
must
treat
you
mercifully
for
his
own
sake
,
if
he
is
afraid
of
you
and
your
friends
.
<EOS>
And
if
he
treats
you
mercifully
,
and
if
I
can
say
it
was
my
doing
 
<EOS>
"
I
listened
eagerly
for
more
,
but
she
stopped
at
those
words
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
tried
to
make
her
go
on
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tried
,
but
she
only
drew
herself
away
from
me
again
,
and
leaned
her
face
and
arms
against
the
side
of
the
boat
-
house
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
"
I
heard
her
say
,
with
a
dreadful
,
distracted
tenderness
in
her
voice
,
"
oh
!
<EOS>
if
I
could
only
be
buried
with
your
mother
!
<EOS>
If
I
could
only
wake
at
her
side
,
when
the
angel
's
trumpet
sounds
,
and
the
graves
give
up
their
dead
at
the
resurrection
!
"
 
<EOS>
Marian
!
<EOS>
I
trembled
from
head
to
foot
 
<EOS>
it
was
horrible
to
hear
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
there
is
no
hope
of
that
,
"
she
said
,
moving
a
little
,
so
as
to
look
at
me
again
,
"
no
hope
for
a
poor
stranger
like
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
rest
under
the
marble
cross
that
I
washed
with
my
own
hands
,
and
made
so
white
and
pure
for
her
sake
.
<EOS>
Oh
no
!
<EOS>
oh
no
!
<EOS>
God
's
mercy
,
not
man
's
,
will
take
me
to
her
,
where
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
the
weary
are
at
rest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
spoke
those
words
quietly
and
sorrowfully
,
with
a
heavy
,
hopeless
sigh
,
and
then
waited
a
little
.
<EOS>
Her
face
was
confused
and
troubled
,
she
seemed
to
be
thinking
,
or
trying
to
think
.
<EOS>
"
What
was
it
I
said
just
now
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
after
a
while
.
<EOS>
"
When
your
mother
is
in
my
mind
,
everything
else
goes
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
What
was
I
saying
?
<EOS>
what
was
I
saying
?
<EOS>
"
I
reminded
the
poor
creature
,
as
kindly
and
delicately
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
yes
,
yes
,
"
she
said
,
still
in
a
vacant
,
perplexed
manner
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
helpless
with
your
wicked
husband
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
And
I
must
do
what
I
have
come
to
do
here
 
<EOS>
I
must
make
it
up
to
you
for
having
been
afraid
to
speak
out
at
a
better
time
.
"
<EOS>
"
What
IS
it
you
have
to
tell
me
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
The
Secret
that
your
cruel
husband
is
afraid
of
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
once
threatened
him
with
the
Secret
,
and
frightened
him
.
<EOS>
You
shall
threaten
him
with
the
Secret
,
and
frighten
him
too
.
"
<EOS>
Her
face
darkened
,
and
a
hard
,
angry
stare
fixed
itself
in
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
began
waving
her
hand
at
me
in
a
vacant
,
unmeaning
manner
.
<EOS>
"
My
mother
knows
the
Secret
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
My
mother
has
wasted
under
the
Secret
half
her
lifetime
.
<EOS>
One
day
,
when
I
was
grown
up
,
she
said
something
to
ME
.
<EOS>
And
the
next
day
your
husband
 
"
"
  
"
Yes
!
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
Go
on
.
<EOS>
What
did
she
tell
you
about
your
husband
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
stopped
again
,
Marian
,
at
that
point
 
"
  
"
And
said
no
more
?
"
  
"
And
listened
eagerly
.
"
<EOS>
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
she
whispered
,
still
waving
her
hand
at
me
.
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
She
moved
aside
out
of
the
doorway
,
moved
slowly
and
stealthily
,
step
by
step
,
till
I
lost
her
past
the
edge
of
the
boat
-
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
you
followed
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
anxiety
made
me
bold
enough
to
rise
and
follow
her
.
<EOS>
Just
as
I
reached
the
entrance
,
she
appeared
again
suddenly
,
round
the
side
of
the
boat
-
house
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Secret
,
"
I
whispered
to
her
 
"
wait
and
tell
me
the
Secret
!
"
<EOS>
She
caught
hold
of
my
arm
,
and
looked
at
me
with
wild
frightened
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
Not
now
,
"
she
said
,
"
we
are
not
alone
 
we
are
watched
.
<EOS>
Come
here
to
-
morrow
at
this
time
 
by
yourself
 
mind
 
by
yourself
.
"
<EOS>
She
pushed
me
roughly
into
the
boat
-
house
again
,
and
I
saw
her
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Laura
,
Laura
,
another
chance
lost
!
<EOS>
If
I
had
only
been
near
you
she
should
not
have
escaped
us
.
<EOS>
On
which
side
did
you
lose
sight
of
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
left
side
,
where
the
ground
sinks
and
the
wood
is
thickest
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
run
out
again
?
<EOS>
did
you
call
after
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
could
I
?
<EOS>
I
was
too
terrified
to
move
or
speak
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
when
you
DID
move
 
when
you
came
out
?
"
  
"
I
ran
back
here
,
to
tell
you
what
had
happened
.
"
  
"
Did
you
see
any
one
,
or
hear
any
one
,
in
the
plantation
?
"
  
"
No
,
it
seemed
to
be
all
still
and
quiet
when
I
passed
through
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
waited
for
a
moment
to
consider
.
<EOS>
Was
this
third
person
,
supposed
to
have
been
secretly
present
at
the
interview
,
a
reality
,
or
the
creature
of
Anne
Catherick
's
excited
fancy
?
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
determine
.
<EOS>
The
one
thing
certain
was
,
that
we
had
failed
again
on
the
very
brink
of
discovery
 
failed
utterly
and
irretrievably
,
unless
Anne
Catherick
kept
her
appointment
at
the
boat
-
house
for
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
quite
sure
you
have
told
me
everything
that
passed
?
<EOS>
Every
word
that
was
said
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
My
powers
of
memory
,
Marian
,
are
not
like
yours
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
so
strongly
impressed
,
so
deeply
interested
,
that
nothing
of
any
importance
can
possibly
have
escaped
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Laura
,
the
merest
trifles
are
of
importance
where
Anne
Catherick
is
concerned
.
<EOS>
Think
again
.
<EOS>
Did
no
chance
reference
escape
her
as
to
the
place
in
which
she
is
living
at
the
present
time
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
that
I
can
remember
.
"
  
"
Did
she
not
mention
a
companion
and
friend
 
<EOS>
a
woman
named
Mrs.
Clements
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
!
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
I
forgot
that
.
<EOS>
She
told
me
Mrs.
Clements
wanted
sadly
to
go
with
her
to
the
lake
and
take
care
of
her
,
and
begged
and
prayed
that
she
would
not
venture
into
this
neighbourhood
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
that
all
she
said
about
Mrs.
Clements
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
that
was
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
told
you
nothing
about
the
place
in
which
she
took
refuge
after
leaving
Todd
's
Corner
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
 
I
am
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
where
she
has
lived
since
?
<EOS>
Nor
what
her
illness
had
been
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Marian
,
not
a
word
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
pray
tell
me
,
what
you
think
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
to
think
,
or
what
to
do
next
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
do
this
,
my
love
:
You
must
carefully
keep
the
appointment
at
the
boat
-
house
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
say
what
interests
may
not
depend
on
your
seeing
that
woman
again
.
<EOS>
You
shall
not
be
left
to
yourself
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
I
will
follow
you
at
a
safe
distance
.
<EOS>
Nobody
shall
see
me
,
but
I
will
keep
within
hearing
of
your
voice
,
if
anything
happens
.
<EOS>
Anne
Catherick
has
escaped
Walter
Hartright
,
and
has
escaped
you
.
<EOS>
Whatever
happens
,
she
shall
not
escape
ME
.
"
  
<EOS>
Laura
's
eyes
read
mine
attentively
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
believe
,
"
she
said
,
"
in
this
secret
that
my
husband
is
afraid
of
?
<EOS>
Suppose
,
Marian
<EOS>
,
it
should
only
exist
after
all
in
Anne
Catherick
's
fancy
?
<EOS>
Suppose
she
only
wanted
to
see
me
and
to
speak
to
me
,
for
the
sake
of
old
remembrances
?
<EOS>
Her
manner
was
so
strange
 
<EOS>
I
almost
doubted
her
.
<EOS>
Would
you
trust
her
in
other
things
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
trust
nothing
,
Laura
,
but
my
own
observation
of
your
husband
's
conduct
.
<EOS>
I
judge
Anne
Catherick
's
words
by
his
actions
,
and
I
believe
there
is
a
secret
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
said
no
more
,
and
got
up
to
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
Thoughts
were
troubling
me
which
I
might
have
told
her
if
we
had
spoken
together
longer
,
and
which
it
might
have
been
dangerous
for
her
to
know
.
<EOS>
The
influence
of
the
terrible
dream
from
which
she
had
awakened
me
hung
darkly
and
heavily
over
every
fresh
impression
which
the
progress
of
her
narrative
produced
on
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
felt
the
ominous
future
coming
close
,
chilling
me
with
an
unutterable
awe
,
forcing
on
me
the
conviction
of
an
unseen
design
in
the
long
series
of
complications
which
had
now
fastened
round
us
.
<EOS>
I
thought
of
Hartright
 
as
I
saw
him
in
the
body
when
he
said
farewell
;
as
I
saw
him
in
the
spirit
in
my
dream
 
<EOS>
and
I
too
began
to
doubt
now
whether
we
were
not
advancing
blindfold
to
an
appointed
and
an
inevitable
end
.
  
<EOS>
Leaving
Laura
to
go
upstairs
alone
,
I
went
out
to
look
about
me
in
the
walks
near
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
circumstances
under
which
Anne
Catherick
had
parted
from
her
had
made
me
secretly
anxious
to
know
how
Count
Fosco
was
passing
the
afternoon
,
and
had
rendered
me
secretly
distrustful
of
the
results
of
that
solitary
journey
from
which
Sir
Percival
had
returned
<EOS>
but
a
few
hours
since
.
  
<EOS>
After
looking
for
them
in
every
direction
and
discovering
nothing
,
I
returned
to
the
house
,
and
entered
the
different
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
one
after
another
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
empty
.
<EOS>
I
came
out
again
into
the
hall
,
and
went
upstairs
to
return
to
Laura
.
<EOS>
Madame
Fosco
opened
her
door
as
I
passed
it
in
my
way
along
the
passage
,
and
I
stopped
to
see
if
she
could
inform
me
of
the
whereabouts
of
her
husband
and
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
she
had
seen
them
both
from
her
window
more
than
an
hour
since
.
<EOS>
The
Count
had
looked
up
with
his
customary
kindness
,
and
had
mentioned
with
his
habitual
attention
to
her
in
the
smallest
trifles
,
that
he
and
his
friend
were
going
out
together
for
a
long
walk
.
  
<EOS>
For
a
long
walk
!
<EOS>
They
had
never
yet
been
in
each
other
's
company
with
that
object
in
my
experience
of
them
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
cared
for
no
exercise
but
riding
,
and
the
Count
(
except
when
he
was
polite
enough
to
be
my
escort
)
cared
for
no
exercise
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
joined
Laura
again
,
I
found
that
she
had
called
to
mind
in
my
absence
the
impending
question
of
the
signature
to
the
deed
,
which
,
in
the
interest
of
discussing
her
interview
with
Anne
Catherick
,
we
had
hitherto
overlooked
.
<EOS>
Her
first
words
when
I
saw
her
expressed
her
surprise
at
the
absence
of
the
expected
summons
to
attend
Sir
Percival
in
the
library
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
make
your
mind
easy
on
that
subject
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
For
the
present
,
at
least
,
neither
your
resolution
nor
mine
will
be
exposed
to
any
further
trial
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
has
altered
his
plans
 
the
business
of
the
signature
is
put
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Put
off
?
"
<EOS>
Laura
repeated
amazedly
.
<EOS>
"
Who
told
you
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
authority
is
Count
Fosco
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
is
to
his
interference
that
we
are
indebted
for
your
husband
's
sudden
change
of
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
impossible
,
Marian
.
<EOS>
If
the
object
of
my
signing
was
,
as
we
suppose
,
to
obtain
money
for
Sir
Percival
that
he
urgently
wanted
,
how
can
the
matter
be
put
off
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Laura
,
we
have
the
means
at
hand
of
setting
that
doubt
at
rest
.
<EOS>
Have
you
forgotten
the
conversation
that
I
heard
between
Sir
Percival
and
the
lawyer
as
they
were
crossing
the
hall
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
<EOS>
but
I
do
n't
remember
 
"
  
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
alternatives
proposed
.
<EOS>
One
was
to
obtain
your
signature
to
the
parchment
.
<EOS>
The
other
was
to
gain
time
by
giving
bills
at
three
months
.
<EOS>
The
last
resource
is
evidently
the
resource
now
adopted
,
and
we
may
fairly
hope
to
be
relieved
from
our
share
in
Sir
Percival
's
embarrassments
for
some
time
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Marian
,
it
sounds
too
good
to
be
true
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Does
it
,
my
love
?
<EOS>
You
complimented
me
on
my
ready
memory
not
long
since
,
but
you
seem
to
doubt
it
now
.
<EOS>
I
will
get
my
journal
,
and
you
shall
see
if
I
am
right
or
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
went
away
and
got
the
book
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
On
looking
back
to
the
entry
referring
to
the
lawyer
's
visit
,
we
found
that
my
recollection
of
the
two
alternatives
presented
was
accurately
correct
.
<EOS>
It
was
almost
as
great
a
relief
to
my
mind
as
to
Laura
's
,
to
find
that
my
memory
had
served
me
,
on
this
occasion
,
as
faithfully
as
usual
.
<EOS>
In
the
perilous
uncertainty
of
our
present
situation
,
it
is
hard
to
say
what
future
interests
may
not
depend
upon
the
regularity
of
the
entries
in
my
journal
,
and
upon
the
reliability
of
my
recollection
at
the
time
when
I
make
them
.
  
<EOS>
Laura
's
face
and
manner
suggested
to
me
that
this
last
consideration
had
occurred
to
her
as
well
as
to
myself
.
<EOS>
Anyway
,
it
is
only
a
trifling
matter
,
and
I
am
almost
ashamed
to
put
it
down
here
in
writing
 
<EOS>
it
seems
to
set
the
forlornness
of
our
situation
in
such
a
miserably
vivid
light
.
<EOS>
We
must
have
little
indeed
to
depend
on
,
when
the
discovery
that
my
memory
can
still
be
trusted
to
serve
us
is
hailed
as
if
it
was
the
discovery
of
a
new
friend
!
  
<EOS>
The
first
bell
for
dinner
separated
us
.
<EOS>
Just
as
it
had
done
ringing
,
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
returned
from
their
walk
.
<EOS>
We
heard
the
master
of
the
house
storming
at
the
servants
for
being
five
minutes
late
,
and
the
master
's
guest
interposing
,
as
usual
,
in
the
interests
of
propriety
,
patience
,
and
peace
.
     
<EOS>
The
evening
has
come
and
gone
.
<EOS>
No
extraordinary
event
has
happened
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
noticed
certain
peculiarities
in
the
conduct
of
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
,
which
have
sent
me
to
my
bed
feeling
very
anxious
and
uneasy
about
Anne
Catherick
,
and
about
the
results
which
to
-
morrow
may
produce
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
enough
by
this
time
,
to
be
sure
,
that
the
aspect
of
Sir
Percival
which
is
the
most
false
,
and
which
,
therefore
,
means
the
worst
,
is
his
polite
aspect
.
<EOS>
That
long
walk
with
his
friend
had
ended
in
improving
his
manners
,
especially
towards
his
wife
.
<EOS>
To
Laura
's
secret
surprise
and
to
my
secret
alarm
,
he
called
her
by
her
Christian
name
,
asked
if
she
had
heard
lately
from
her
uncle
,
inquired
when
Mrs.
Vesey
was
to
receive
her
invitation
to
Blackwater
,
and
showed
her
so
many
other
little
attentions
that
he
almost
recalled
the
days
of
his
hateful
courtship
at
Limmeridge
House
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
bad
sign
to
begin
with
,
and
I
thought
it
more
ominous
still
that
he
should
pretend
after
dinner
to
fall
asleep
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
that
his
eyes
should
cunningly
follow
Laura
and
me
when
he
thought
we
neither
of
us
suspected
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
had
any
doubt
that
his
sudden
journey
by
himself
took
him
to
Welmingham
to
question
Mrs.
Catherick
 
but
the
experience
of
to
-
night
has
made
me
fear
that
the
expedition
was
not
undertaken
in
vain
,
and
that
he
has
got
the
information
which
he
unquestionably
left
us
to
collect
.
<EOS>
If
I
knew
where
Anne
Catherick
was
to
be
found
,
I
would
be
up
to
-
morrow
with
sunrise
and
warn
her
.
  
<EOS>
While
the
aspect
under
which
Sir
Percival
presented
himself
to
-
night
was
unhappily
but
too
familiar
to
me
,
the
aspect
under
which
the
Count
appeared
was
,
on
the
other
hand
,
entirely
new
in
my
experience
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
permitted
me
,
this
evening
,
to
make
his
acquaintance
,
for
the
first
time
,
in
the
character
of
a
Man
of
Sentiment
 
of
sentiment
,
as
I
believe
,
really
felt
,
not
assumed
for
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
For
instance
,
he
was
quiet
and
subdued
 
his
eyes
and
his
voice
expressed
a
restrained
sensibility
.
<EOS>
He
wore
(
as
if
there
was
some
hidden
connection
between
his
showiest
finery
and
his
deepest
feeling
)
<EOS>
the
most
magnificent
waistcoat
he
has
yet
appeared
in
 
<EOS>
it
was
made
of
pale
sea
-
green
silk
,
and
delicately
trimmed
with
fine
silver
braid
.
<EOS>
His
voice
sank
into
the
tenderest
inflections
,
his
smile
expressed
a
thoughtful
,
fatherly
admiration
,
whenever
he
spoke
to
Laura
or
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
pressed
his
wife
's
hand
under
the
table
when
she
thanked
him
for
trifling
little
attentions
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
took
wine
with
her
.
"
<EOS>
Your
health
and
happiness
,
my
angel
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
with
fond
glistening
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
ate
little
or
nothing
,
and
sighed
,
and
said
"
Good
Percival
!
"
<EOS>
when
his
friend
laughed
at
him
.
<EOS>
After
dinner
,
he
took
Laura
by
the
hand
,
and
asked
her
if
she
would
be
"
so
sweet
as
to
play
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
She
complied
,
through
sheer
astonishment
.
<EOS>
He
sat
by
the
piano
,
with
his
watch
-
chain
resting
in
folds
,
like
a
golden
serpent
,
on
the
sea
-
green
protuberance
of
his
waistcoat
.
<EOS>
His
immense
head
lay
languidly
on
one
side
,
and
he
gently
beat
time
with
two
of
his
yellow
-
white
fingers
.
<EOS>
He
highly
approved
of
the
music
,
and
tenderly
admired
Laura
's
manner
of
playing
 
not
as
poor
Hartright
used
to
praise
it
,
with
an
innocent
enjoyment
of
the
sweet
sounds
,
but
with
a
clear
,
cultivated
,
practical
knowledge
of
the
merits
of
the
composition
,
in
the
first
place
,
and
of
the
merits
of
the
player
's
touch
in
the
second
.
<EOS>
As
the
evening
closed
in
,
he
begged
that
the
lovely
dying
light
might
not
be
profaned
,
just
yet
,
by
the
appearance
of
the
lamps
.
<EOS>
He
came
,
with
his
horribly
silent
tread
,
to
the
distant
window
at
which
I
was
standing
,
to
be
out
of
his
way
and
to
avoid
the
very
sight
of
him
 
<EOS>
he
came
to
ask
me
to
support
his
protest
against
the
lamps
.
<EOS>
If
any
one
of
them
could
only
have
burnt
him
up
at
that
moment
,
I
would
have
gone
down
to
the
kitchen
and
fetched
it
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
you
like
this
modest
,
trembling
English
twilight
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
softly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
love
it
.
<EOS>
I
feel
my
inborn
admiration
of
all
that
is
noble
,
and
great
,
and
good
,
purified
by
the
breath
of
heaven
on
an
evening
like
this
.
<EOS>
Nature
has
such
imperishable
charms
,
such
inextinguishable
tenderness
for
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
an
old
,
fat
man
 
talk
which
would
become
your
lips
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
sounds
like
a
derision
and
a
mockery
on
mine
.
<EOS>
It
is
hard
to
be
laughed
at
in
my
moments
of
sentiment
,
as
if
my
soul
was
like
myself
,
old
and
overgrown
.
<EOS>
Observe
,
dear
lady
,
what
a
light
is
dying
on
the
trees
!
<EOS>
Does
it
penetrate
your
heart
,
as
it
penetrates
mine
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
paused
,
looked
at
me
,
and
repeated
the
famous
lines
of
Dante
on
the
Evening
-
time
,
with
a
melody
and
tenderness
which
added
a
charm
of
their
own
to
the
matchless
beauty
of
the
poetry
itself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
suddenly
,
as
the
last
cadence
of
those
noble
Italian
words
died
away
on
his
lips
;
"
I
make
an
old
fool
of
myself
,
and
only
weary
you
all
!
<EOS>
Let
us
shut
up
the
window
in
our
bosoms
and
get
back
to
the
matter
-
of
-
fact
world
.
<EOS>
Percival
!
<EOS>
I
sanction
the
admission
of
the
lamps
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
 
Miss
Halcombe
 
<EOS>
Eleanor
,
my
good
wife
 
which
of
you
will
indulge
me
with
a
game
at
dominoes
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
addressed
us
all
,
but
he
looked
especially
at
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
learnt
to
feel
my
dread
of
offending
him
,
and
she
accepted
his
proposal
.
<EOS>
It
was
more
than
I
could
have
done
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
sat
down
at
the
same
table
with
him
for
any
consideration
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
seemed
to
reach
my
inmost
soul
through
the
thickening
obscurity
of
the
twilight
.
<EOS>
His
voice
trembled
along
every
nerve
in
my
body
,
and
turned
me
hot
and
cold
alternately
.
<EOS>
The
mystery
and
terror
of
my
dream
,
which
had
haunted
me
at
intervals
all
through
the
evening
,
now
oppressed
my
mind
with
an
unendurable
foreboding
and
an
unutterable
awe
.
<EOS>
I
saw
the
white
tomb
again
,
and
the
veiled
woman
rising
out
of
it
by
Hartright
's
side
.
<EOS>
The
thought
of
Laura
welled
up
like
a
spring
in
the
depths
of
my
heart
,
and
filled
it
with
waters
of
bitterness
,
never
,
never
known
to
it
before
.
<EOS>
I
caught
her
by
the
hand
as
she
passed
me
on
her
way
to
the
table
,
and
kissed
her
as
if
that
night
was
to
part
us
for
ever
.
<EOS>
While
they
were
all
gazing
at
me
in
astonishment
,
I
ran
out
through
the
low
window
which
was
open
before
me
to
the
ground
 
ran
out
to
hide
from
them
in
the
darkness
,
to
hide
even
from
myself
.
  
<EOS>
We
separated
that
evening
later
than
usual
.
<EOS>
Towards
midnight
the
summer
silence
was
broken
by
the
shuddering
of
a
low
,
melancholy
wind
among
the
trees
.
<EOS>
We
all
felt
the
sudden
chill
in
the
atmosphere
,
but
the
Count
was
the
first
to
notice
the
stealthy
rising
of
the
wind
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
while
he
was
lighting
my
candle
for
me
,
and
held
up
his
hand
warningly
    
"
Listen
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
There
will
be
a
change
to
-
morrow
.
"
    
<EOS>
June
19th
.
 
<EOS>
The
events
of
yesterday
warned
me
to
be
ready
,
sooner
or
later
,
to
meet
the
worst
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
is
not
yet
at
an
end
,
and
the
worst
has
come
.
  
<EOS>
Judging
by
the
closest
calculation
of
time
that
Laura
and
I
could
make
,
we
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
Anne
Catherick
must
have
appeared
at
the
boat
-
house
at
half
-
past
two
o'clock
on
the
afternoon
of
yesterday
.
<EOS>
I
accordingly
arranged
that
Laura
should
just
show
herself
at
the
luncheon
-
table
to
-
day
,
and
should
then
slip
out
at
the
first
opportunity
,
leaving
me
behind
to
preserve
appearances
,
and
to
follow
her
as
soon
as
I
could
safely
do
so
.
<EOS>
This
mode
of
proceeding
,
if
no
obstacles
occurred
to
thwart
us
,
would
enable
her
to
be
at
the
boat
-
house
before
half
-
past
two
,
and
(
when
I
left
the
table
,
in
my
turn
)
would
take
me
to
a
safe
position
in
the
plantation
before
three
.
  
<EOS>
The
change
in
the
weather
,
which
last
night
's
wind
warned
us
to
expect
,
came
with
the
morning
.
<EOS>
It
was
raining
heavily
when
I
got
up
,
and
it
continued
to
rain
until
twelve
o'clock
 
when
the
clouds
dispersed
,
the
blue
sky
appeared
,
and
the
sun
shone
again
with
the
bright
promise
of
a
fine
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
My
anxiety
to
know
how
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
would
occupy
the
early
part
of
the
day
was
by
no
means
set
at
rest
,
so
far
as
Sir
Percival
was
concerned
,
by
his
leaving
us
immediately
after
breakfast
,
and
going
out
by
himself
,
in
spite
of
the
rain
.
<EOS>
He
neither
told
us
where
he
was
going
nor
when
we
might
expect
him
back
.
<EOS>
We
saw
him
pass
the
breakfast
-
room
window
hastily
,
with
his
high
boots
and
his
waterproof
coat
on
 
<EOS>
and
that
was
all
.
  
<EOS>
The
Count
passed
the
morning
quietly
indoors
,
some
part
of
it
in
the
library
,
some
part
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
playing
odds
and
ends
of
music
on
the
piano
,
and
humming
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Judging
by
appearances
,
the
sentimental
side
of
his
character
was
persistently
inclined
to
betray
itself
still
.
<EOS>
He
was
silent
and
sensitive
,
and
ready
to
sigh
and
languish
ponderously
(
as
only
fat
men
CAN
sigh
and
languish
)
on
the
smallest
provocation
.
  
<EOS>
Luncheon
-
time
came
and
Sir
Percival
did
not
return
.
<EOS>
The
Count
took
his
friend
's
place
at
the
table
,
plaintively
devoured
the
greater
part
of
a
fruit
tart
,
submerged
under
a
whole
jugful
of
cream
,
and
explained
the
full
merit
of
the
achievement
to
us
as
soon
as
he
had
done
.
"
<EOS>
A
taste
for
sweets
,
"
he
said
in
his
softest
tones
and
his
tenderest
manner
,
"
is
the
innocent
taste
of
women
and
children
.
<EOS>
I
love
to
share
it
with
them
 
<EOS>
it
is
another
bond
,
dear
ladies
,
between
you
and
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Laura
left
the
table
in
ten
minutes
'
time
.
<EOS>
I
was
sorely
tempted
to
accompany
her
.
<EOS>
But
if
we
had
both
gone
out
together
we
must
have
excited
suspicion
,
and
worse
still
,
if
we
allowed
Anne
Catherick
to
see
Laura
,
accompanied
by
a
second
person
who
was
a
stranger
to
her
,
we
should
in
all
probability
forfeit
her
confidence
from
that
moment
,
never
to
regain
it
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
waited
,
therefore
,
as
patiently
as
I
could
,
until
the
servant
came
in
to
clear
the
table
.
<EOS>
When
I
quitted
the
room
,
there
were
no
signs
,
in
the
house
or
out
of
it
,
of
Sir
Percival
's
return
.
<EOS>
I
left
the
Count
with
a
piece
of
sugar
between
his
lips
,
and
the
vicious
cockatoo
scrambling
up
his
waistcoat
to
get
at
it
,
while
Madame
Fosco
,
sitting
opposite
to
her
husband
,
watched
the
proceedings
of
his
bird
and
himself
as
attentively
as
if
she
had
never
seen
anything
of
the
sort
before
in
her
life
.
<EOS>
On
my
way
to
the
plantation
I
kept
carefully
beyond
the
range
of
view
from
the
luncheon
-
room
window
.
<EOS>
Nobody
saw
me
and
nobody
followed
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
a
quarter
to
three
o'clock
by
my
watch
.
  
<EOS>
Once
among
the
trees
I
walked
rapidly
,
until
I
had
advanced
more
than
half
-
way
through
the
plantation
.
<EOS>
At
that
point
I
slackened
my
pace
and
proceeded
cautiously
,
but
I
saw
no
one
,
and
heard
no
voices
.
<EOS>
By
little
and
little
I
came
within
view
of
the
back
of
the
boat
-
house
 
stopped
and
listened
 
then
went
on
,
till
I
was
close
behind
it
,
and
must
have
heard
any
persons
who
were
talking
inside
.
<EOS>
Still
the
silence
was
unbroken
 
still
far
and
near
no
sign
of
a
living
creature
appeared
anywhere
.
  
<EOS>
After
skirting
round
by
the
back
of
the
building
,
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
,
and
making
no
discoveries
,
I
ventured
in
front
of
it
,
and
fairly
looked
in
.
<EOS>
The
place
was
empty
.
  
<EOS>
I
called
,
"
Laura
!
"
 
<EOS>
at
first
softly
,
then
louder
and
louder
.
<EOS>
No
one
answered
and
no
one
appeared
.
<EOS>
For
all
that
I
could
see
and
hear
,
the
only
human
creature
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
lake
and
the
plantation
was
myself
.
  
<EOS>
My
heart
began
to
beat
violently
,
but
I
kept
my
resolution
,
and
searched
,
first
the
boat
-
house
and
then
the
ground
in
front
of
it
,
for
any
signs
which
might
show
me
whether
Laura
had
really
reached
the
place
or
not
.
<EOS>
No
mark
of
her
presence
appeared
inside
the
building
,
but
I
found
traces
of
her
outside
it
,
in
footsteps
on
the
sand
.
  
<EOS>
I
detected
the
footsteps
of
two
persons
 
large
footsteps
like
a
man
's
,
and
small
footsteps
,
which
,
by
putting
my
own
feet
into
them
and
testing
their
size
in
that
manner
,
I
felt
certain
were
Laura
's
.
<EOS>
The
ground
was
confusedly
marked
in
this
way
just
before
the
boat
-
house
.
<EOS>
Close
against
one
side
of
it
,
under
shelter
of
the
projecting
roof
,
I
discovered
a
little
hole
in
the
sand
 
<EOS>
a
hole
artificially
made
,
beyond
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
just
noticed
it
,
and
then
turned
away
immediately
to
trace
the
footsteps
as
far
as
I
could
,
and
to
follow
the
direction
in
which
they
might
lead
me
.
  
<EOS>
They
led
me
,
starting
from
the
left
-
hand
side
of
the
boat
-
house
,
along
the
edge
of
the
trees
,
a
distance
<EOS>
,
I
should
think
,
of
between
two
and
three
hundred
yards
,
and
then
the
sandy
ground
showed
no
further
trace
of
them
.
<EOS>
Feeling
that
the
persons
whose
course
I
was
tracking
must
necessarily
have
entered
the
plantation
at
this
point
,
I
entered
it
too
.
<EOS>
At
first
I
could
find
no
path
,
but
I
discovered
one
afterwards
,
just
faintly
traced
among
the
trees
,
and
followed
it
.
<EOS>
It
took
me
,
for
some
distance
,
in
the
direction
of
the
village
,
until
I
stopped
at
a
point
where
another
foot
-
track
crossed
it
.
<EOS>
The
brambles
grew
thickly
on
either
side
of
this
second
path
.
<EOS>
I
stood
looking
down
it
,
uncertain
which
way
to
take
next
,
and
while
I
looked
I
saw
on
one
thorny
branch
some
fragments
of
fringe
from
a
woman
's
shawl
.
<EOS>
A
closer
examination
of
the
fringe
satisfied
me
that
it
had
been
torn
from
a
shawl
of
Laura
's
,
and
I
instantly
followed
the
second
path
.
<EOS>
It
brought
me
out
at
last
,
to
my
great
relief
,
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
say
to
my
great
relief
,
because
I
inferred
that
Laura
must
,
for
some
unknown
reason
,
have
returned
before
me
by
this
roundabout
way
.
<EOS>
I
went
in
by
the
court
-
yard
and
the
offices
.
<EOS>
The
first
person
whom
I
met
in
crossing
the
servants
'
hall
was
Mrs.
Michelson
,
the
housekeeper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
"
I
asked
,
"
whether
Lady
Glyde
has
come
in
from
her
walk
or
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
lady
came
in
a
little
while
ago
with
Sir
Percival
,
"
answered
the
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
something
very
distressing
has
happened
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
heart
sank
within
me
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
an
accident
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
faintly
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
 
thank
God
,
no
accident
.
<EOS>
But
my
lady
ran
upstairs
to
her
own
room
in
tears
,
and
Sir
Percival
has
ordered
me
to
give
Fanny
warning
to
leave
in
an
hour
's
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
was
Laura
's
maid
 
<EOS>
a
good
affectionate
girl
who
had
been
with
her
for
years
 
<EOS>
the
only
person
in
the
house
whose
fidelity
and
devotion
we
could
both
depend
upon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Fanny
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
my
room
,
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
The
young
woman
is
quite
overcome
,
and
I
told
her
to
sit
down
and
try
to
recover
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
went
to
Mrs.
Michelson
's
room
,
and
found
Fanny
in
a
corner
,
with
her
box
by
her
side
,
crying
bitterly
.
  
<EOS>
She
could
give
me
no
explanation
whatever
of
her
sudden
dismissal
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
had
ordered
that
she
should
have
a
month
's
wages
,
in
place
of
a
month
's
warning
,
and
go
.
<EOS>
No
reason
had
been
assigned
 
no
objection
had
been
made
to
her
conduct
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
forbidden
to
appeal
to
her
mistress
,
forbidden
even
to
see
her
for
a
moment
to
say
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
She
was
to
go
without
explanations
or
farewells
,
and
to
go
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
After
soothing
the
poor
girl
by
a
few
friendly
words
,
I
asked
where
she
proposed
to
sleep
that
night
.
<EOS>
She
replied
that
she
thought
of
going
to
the
little
inn
in
the
village
,
the
landlady
of
which
was
a
respectable
woman
,
known
to
the
servants
at
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
The
next
morning
,
by
leaving
early
,
she
might
get
back
to
her
friends
in
Cumberland
without
stopping
in
London
,
where
she
was
a
total
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
I
felt
directly
that
Fanny
's
departure
offered
us
a
safe
means
of
communication
with
London
and
with
Limmeridge
House
,
of
which
it
might
be
very
important
to
avail
ourselves
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
I
told
her
that
she
might
expect
to
hear
from
her
mistress
or
from
me
in
the
course
of
the
evening
,
and
that
she
might
depend
on
our
both
doing
all
that
lay
in
our
power
to
help
her
,
under
the
trial
of
leaving
us
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
Those
words
said
,
I
shook
hands
with
her
and
went
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
The
door
which
led
to
Laura
's
room
was
the
door
of
an
ante
-
chamber
opening
on
to
the
passage
.
<EOS>
When
I
tried
it
,
it
was
bolted
on
the
inside
.
  
<EOS>
I
knocked
,
and
the
door
was
opened
by
the
same
heavy
,
overgrown
housemaid
whose
lumpish
insensibility
had
tried
my
patience
so
severely
on
the
day
when
I
found
the
wounded
dog
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
,
since
that
time
,
discovered
that
her
name
was
Margaret
Porcher
,
and
that
she
was
the
most
awkward
,
slatternly
,
and
obstinate
servant
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
On
opening
the
door
she
instantly
stepped
out
to
the
threshold
,
and
stood
grinning
at
me
in
stolid
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
stand
there
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
see
that
I
want
to
come
in
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
but
you
must
n't
come
in
,
"
was
the
answer
,
with
another
and
a
broader
grin
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
talk
to
me
in
that
way
?
<EOS>
Stand
back
instantly
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
stretched
out
a
great
red
hand
and
arm
on
each
side
of
her
,
so
as
to
bar
the
doorway
,
and
slowly
nodded
her
addle
head
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Master
's
orders
,
"
she
said
,
and
nodded
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
need
of
all
my
self
-
control
to
warn
me
against
contesting
the
matter
with
HER
,
and
to
remind
me
that
the
next
words
I
had
to
say
must
be
addressed
to
her
master
.
<EOS>
I
turned
my
back
on
her
,
and
instantly
went
downstairs
to
find
him
.
<EOS>
My
resolution
to
keep
my
temper
under
all
the
irritations
that
Sir
Percival
could
offer
was
,
by
this
time
,
as
completely
forgotten
 
<EOS>
I
say
so
to
my
shame
 
as
if
I
had
never
made
it
.
<EOS>
It
did
me
good
,
after
all
I
had
suffered
and
suppressed
in
that
house
 
<EOS>
it
actually
did
me
good
to
feel
how
angry
I
was
.
  
<EOS>
The
drawing
-
room
and
the
breakfast
-
room
were
both
empty
.
<EOS>
I
went
on
to
the
library
,
and
there
I
found
Sir
Percival
,
the
Count
,
and
Madame
Fosco
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
three
standing
up
,
close
together
,
and
Sir
Percival
had
a
little
slip
of
paper
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
As
I
opened
the
door
I
heard
the
Count
say
to
him
,
"
No
 
<EOS>
a
thousand
times
over
,
no
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
walked
straight
up
to
him
,
and
looked
him
full
in
the
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
to
understand
,
Sir
Percival
,
that
your
wife
's
room
is
a
prison
,
and
that
your
housemaid
is
the
gaoler
who
keeps
it
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
that
is
what
you
are
to
understand
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Take
care
my
gaoler
has
n't
got
double
duty
to
do
 
<EOS>
take
care
<EOS>
your
room
is
not
a
prison
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
YOU
care
how
you
treat
your
wife
,
and
how
you
threaten
ME
,
"
I
broke
out
in
the
heat
of
my
anger
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
laws
in
England
to
protect
women
from
cruelty
and
outrage
.
<EOS>
If
you
hurt
a
hair
of
Laura
's
head
,
if
you
dare
to
interfere
with
my
freedom
,
come
what
may
,
to
those
laws
I
will
appeal
.
"
  
<EOS>
Instead
of
answering
me
he
turned
round
to
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
I
tell
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
said
before
,
"
replied
the
Count
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
Even
in
the
vehemence
of
my
anger
I
felt
his
calm
,
cold
,
grey
eyes
on
my
face
.
<EOS>
They
turned
away
from
me
as
soon
as
he
had
spoken
,
and
looked
significantly
at
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Madame
Fosco
immediately
moved
close
to
my
side
,
and
in
that
position
addressed
Sir
Percival
before
either
of
us
could
speak
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Favour
me
with
your
attention
for
one
moment
,
"
she
said
,
in
her
clear
icily
-
suppressed
tones
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
to
thank
you
,
Sir
Percival
,
for
your
hospitality
,
and
to
decline
taking
advantage
of
it
any
longer
.
<EOS>
I
remain
in
no
house
in
which
ladies
are
treated
as
your
wife
and
Miss
Halcombe
have
been
treated
here
to
-
day
!
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
drew
back
a
step
,
and
stared
at
her
in
dead
silence
.
<EOS>
The
declaration
he
had
just
heard
 
a
declaration
which
he
well
knew
,
as
I
well
knew
,
Madame
Fosco
would
not
have
ventured
to
make
without
her
husband
's
permission
 
seemed
to
petrify
him
with
surprise
.
<EOS>
The
Count
stood
by
,
and
looked
at
his
wife
with
the
most
enthusiastic
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
sublime
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
approached
her
while
he
spoke
,
and
drew
her
hand
through
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
at
your
service
,
Eleanor
,
"
he
went
on
,
with
a
quiet
dignity
that
I
had
never
noticed
in
him
before
.
"
<EOS>
And
at
Miss
Halcombe
's
service
,
if
she
will
honour
me
by
accepting
all
the
assistance
I
can
offer
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Damn
it
!
<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
?
"
cried
Sir
Percival
,
as
the
Count
quietly
moved
away
with
his
wife
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
other
times
I
mean
what
I
say
,
but
at
this
time
I
mean
what
my
wife
says
,
"
replied
the
impenetrable
Italian
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
changed
places
,
Percival
,
for
once
,
and
Madame
Fosco
's
opinion
is
 
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
crumpled
up
the
paper
in
his
hand
,
and
pushing
past
the
Count
,
with
another
oath
,
stood
between
him
and
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
your
own
way
,
"
he
said
,
with
baffled
rage
in
his
low
,
half
-
whispering
tones
.
"
<EOS>
Have
your
own
way
 
and
see
what
comes
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
With
those
words
he
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Fosco
glanced
inquiringly
at
her
husband
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
gone
away
very
suddenly
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
does
it
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
means
that
you
and
I
together
have
brought
the
worst
-
tempered
man
in
all
England
to
his
senses
,
"
answered
the
Count
.
<EOS>
"
It
means
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
that
Lady
Glyde
is
relieved
from
a
gross
indignity
,
and
you
from
the
repetition
of
an
unpardonable
insult
.
<EOS>
Suffer
me
to
express
my
admiration
of
your
conduct
and
your
courage
at
a
very
trying
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sincere
admiration
,
"
suggested
Madame
Fosco
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sincere
admiration
,
"
echoed
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
no
longer
the
strength
of
my
first
angry
resistance
to
outrage
and
injury
to
support
me
.
<EOS>
My
heart
-
sick
anxiety
to
see
Laura
,
my
sense
of
my
own
helpless
ignorance
of
what
had
happened
at
the
boat
-
house
,
pressed
on
me
with
an
intolerable
weight
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
keep
up
appearances
by
speaking
to
the
Count
and
his
wife
in
the
tone
which
they
had
chosen
to
adopt
in
speaking
to
me
,
but
the
words
failed
on
my
lips
 
my
breath
came
short
and
thick
 
<EOS>
my
eyes
looked
longingly
,
in
silence
,
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
Count
,
understanding
my
anxiety
,
opened
it
,
went
out
,
and
pulled
it
to
after
him
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
Sir
Percival
's
heavy
step
descended
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
I
heard
them
whispering
together
outside
,
while
Madame
Fosco
was
assuring
me
,
in
her
calmest
and
most
conventional
manner
,
that
she
rejoiced
,
for
all
our
sakes
,
that
Sir
Percival
's
conduct
had
not
obliged
her
husband
and
herself
to
leave
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
Before
she
had
done
speaking
the
whispering
ceased
,
the
door
opened
,
and
the
Count
looked
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
am
happy
to
inform
you
that
Lady
Glyde
is
mistress
again
in
her
own
house
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
might
be
more
agreeable
to
you
to
hear
of
this
change
for
the
better
from
me
than
from
Sir
Percival
,
and
I
have
therefore
expressly
returned
to
mention
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Admirable
delicacy
!
"
said
Madame
Fosco
,
paying
back
her
husband
's
tribute
of
admiration
with
the
Count
's
own
coin
,
in
the
Count
's
own
manner
.
<EOS>
He
smiled
and
bowed
as
if
he
had
received
a
formal
compliment
from
a
polite
stranger
,
and
drew
back
to
let
me
pass
out
first
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
was
standing
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
As
I
hurried
to
the
stairs
I
heard
him
call
impatiently
to
the
Count
to
come
out
of
the
library
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
waiting
there
for
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
want
to
think
a
little
by
myself
,
"
replied
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
Wait
till
later
,
Percival
,
wait
till
later
.
"
  
<EOS>
Neither
he
nor
his
friend
said
any
more
.
<EOS>
I
gained
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
ran
along
the
passage
.
<EOS>
In
my
haste
and
my
agitation
I
left
the
door
of
the
ante
-
chamber
open
,
but
I
closed
the
door
of
the
bedroom
the
moment
I
was
inside
it
.
  
<EOS>
Laura
was
sitting
alone
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
,
her
arms
resting
wearily
on
a
table
,
and
her
face
hidden
in
her
hands
.
<EOS>
She
started
up
with
a
cry
of
delight
when
she
saw
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
did
you
get
here
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Who
gave
you
leave
?
<EOS>
Not
Sir
Percival
?
"
  
<EOS>
In
my
overpowering
anxiety
to
hear
what
she
had
to
tell
me
,
I
could
not
answer
her
 
<EOS>
I
could
only
put
questions
on
my
side
.
<EOS>
Laura
's
eagerness
to
know
what
had
passed
downstairs
proved
,
however
,
too
strong
to
be
resisted
.
<EOS>
She
persistently
repeated
her
inquiries
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Count
,
of
course
,
"
I
answered
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
Whose
influence
in
the
house
 
"
  
She
stopped
me
with
a
gesture
of
disgust
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
speak
of
him
,
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Count
is
the
vilest
creature
breathing
!
<EOS>
The
Count
is
a
miserable
Spy
 
!
"
  
<EOS>
Before
we
could
either
of
us
say
another
word
we
were
alarmed
by
a
soft
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
bedroom
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
not
yet
sat
down
,
and
I
went
first
to
see
who
it
was
.
<EOS>
When
I
opened
the
door
Madame
Fosco
confronted
me
with
my
handkerchief
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
dropped
this
downstairs
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
she
said
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
thought
I
could
bring
it
to
you
,
as
I
was
passing
by
to
my
own
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
face
,
naturally
pale
,
had
turned
to
such
a
ghastly
whiteness
that
I
started
at
the
sight
of
it
.
<EOS>
Her
hands
,
so
sure
and
steady
at
all
other
times
,
trembled
violently
,
and
her
eyes
looked
wolfishly
past
me
through
the
open
door
,
and
fixed
on
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
been
listening
before
she
knocked
!
<EOS>
I
saw
it
in
her
white
face
,
I
saw
it
in
her
trembling
hands
,
I
saw
it
in
her
look
at
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
After
waiting
an
instant
she
turned
from
me
in
silence
,
and
slowly
walked
away
.
  
<EOS>
I
closed
the
door
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Laura
!
<EOS>
Laura
!
<EOS>
We
shall
both
rue
the
day
when
you
called
the
Count
a
Spy
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
have
called
him
<EOS>
so
yourself
,
Marian
,
if
you
had
known
what
I
know
.
<EOS>
Anne
Catherick
was
right
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
third
person
watching
us
in
the
plantation
yesterday
,
and
that
third
person
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Are
you
sure
it
was
the
Count
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
absolutely
certain
.
<EOS>
He
was
Sir
Percival
's
spy
 
<EOS>
he
was
Sir
Percival
's
informer
 
<EOS>
he
set
Sir
Percival
watching
and
waiting
,
all
the
morning
through
,
for
Anne
Catherick
and
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Anne
found
?
<EOS>
Did
you
see
her
at
the
lake
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
She
has
saved
herself
by
keeping
away
from
the
place
.
<EOS>
When
I
got
to
the
boat
-
house
<EOS>
no
one
was
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
?
<EOS>
Yes
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
went
in
and
sat
waiting
for
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
But
my
restlessness
made
me
get
up
again
,
to
walk
about
a
little
.
<EOS>
As
I
passed
out
I
saw
some
marks
on
the
sand
,
close
under
the
front
of
the
boat
-
house
.
<EOS>
I
stooped
down
to
examine
them
,
and
discovered
a
word
written
in
large
letters
on
the
sand
.
<EOS>
The
word
was
 
LOOK
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
scraped
away
the
sand
,
and
dug
a
hollow
place
in
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
that
,
Marian
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
saw
the
hollow
place
myself
when
I
followed
you
to
the
boat
-
house
.
<EOS>
Go
on
 
go
on
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
scraped
away
the
sand
on
the
surface
,
and
in
a
little
while
I
came
to
a
strip
of
paper
hidden
beneath
,
which
had
writing
on
it
.
<EOS>
The
writing
was
signed
with
Anne
Catherick
's
initials
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Percival
has
taken
it
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
remember
what
the
writing
was
?
<EOS>
Do
you
think
you
can
repeat
it
to
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
substance
I
can
,
Marian
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
short
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
remembered
it
,
word
for
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Try
to
tell
me
what
the
substance
was
before
we
go
any
further
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
complied
.
<EOS>
I
write
the
lines
down
here
exactly
as
she
repeated
them
to
me
.
<EOS>
They
ran
thus
    
<EOS>
"
I
was
seen
with
you
,
yesterday
,
by
a
tall
,
stout
old
man
,
and
had
to
run
to
save
myself
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
quick
enough
on
his
feet
to
follow
me
,
and
he
lost
me
among
the
trees
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
risk
coming
back
here
to
-
day
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
I
write
this
,
and
hide
it
in
the
sand
,
at
six
in
the
morning
,
to
tell
you
so
.
<EOS>
When
we
speak
next
of
your
wicked

's
Secret
we
must
speak
safely
,
or
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
Try
to
have
patience
.
<EOS>
I
promise
you
shall
see
me
again
and
that
soon
.
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
The
reference
to
the
"
tall
,
stout
old
man
"
(
the
terms
of
which
Laura
was
certain
that
she
had
repeated
to
me
correctly
)
left
no
doubt
as
to
who
the
intruder
had
been
.
<EOS>
I
called
to
mind
that
I
had
told
Sir
Percival
,
in
the
Count
's
presence
the
day
before
,
that
Laura
had
gone
to
the
boat
-
house
to
look
for
her
brooch
.
<EOS>
In
all
probability
he
had
followed
her
there
,
in
his
officious
way
,
to
relieve
her
mind
about
the
matter
of
the
signature
,
immediately
after
he
had
mentioned
the
change
in
Sir
Percival
's
plans
to
me
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
In
this
case
he
could
only
have
got
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
boat
-
house
at
the
very
moment
when
Anne
Catherick
discovered
him
.
<EOS>
The
suspiciously
hurried
manner
in
which
she
parted
from
Laura
had
no
doubt
prompted
his
useless
attempt
to
follow
her
.
<EOS>
Of
the
conversation
which
had
previously
taken
place
between
them
he
could
have
heard
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
distance
between
the
house
and
the
lake
,
and
the
time
at
which
he
left
me
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
as
compared
with
the
time
at
which
Laura
and
Anne
Catherick
had
been
speaking
together
,
proved
that
fact
to
us
at
any
rate
,
beyond
a
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
Having
arrived
at
something
like
a
conclusion
so
far
,
my
next
great
interest
was
to
know
what
discoveries
Sir
Percival
had
made
after
Count
Fosco
had
given
him
his
information
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
came
you
to
lose
possession
of
the
letter
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
do
with
it
when
you
found
it
in
the
sand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
After
reading
it
once
through
,
"
she
replied
,
"
I
took
it
into
the
boat
-
house
with
me
to
sit
down
and
look
over
it
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
While
I
was
reading
a
shadow
fell
across
the
paper
.
<EOS>
I
looked
up
,
and
saw
Sir
Percival
standing
in
the
doorway
watching
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
try
to
hide
the
letter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tried
,
but
he
stopped
me
.
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
trouble
to
hide
that
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
happen
to
have
read
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
only
look
at
him
helplessly
 
I
could
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
You
understand
?
<EOS>
"
he
went
on
;
"
I
have
read
it
.
<EOS>
I
dug
it
up
out
of
the
sand
two
hours
since
,
and
buried
it
again
,
and
wrote
the
word
above
it
again
,
and
left
it
ready
to
your
hands
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
lie
yourself
out
of
the
scrape
now
.
<EOS>
You
saw
Anne
Catherick
in
secret
yesterday
,
and
you
have
got
her
letter
in
your
hand
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
caught
HER
yet
,
but
I
have
caught
YOU
.
<EOS>
Give
me
the
letter
.
"
<EOS>
He
stepped
close
up
to
me
 
<EOS>
I
was
alone
with
him
,
Marian
 
<EOS>
what
could
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
gave
him
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
say
when
you
gave
it
to
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
first
he
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
took
me
by
the
arm
,
and
led
me
out
of
the
boat
-
house
,
and
looked
about
him
on
all
sides
,
as
if
he
was
afraid
of
our
being
seen
or
heard
.
<EOS>
Then
he
clasped
his
hand
fast
round
my
arm
,
and
whispered
to
me
,
<EOS>
"
What
did
Anne
Catherick
say
to
you
yesterday
?
<EOS>
I
insist
on
hearing
every
word
,
from
first
to
last
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
tell
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
alone
with
him
,
Marian
 
<EOS>
his
cruel
hand
was
bruising
my
arm
 
<EOS>
what
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
the
mark
on
your
arm
still
?
<EOS>
Let
me
see
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
want
to
see
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
see
it
,
Laura
,
because
our
endurance
must
end
,
and
our
resistance
must
begin
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
That
mark
is
a
weapon
to
strike
him
with
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
it
now
 
I
may
have
to
swear
to
it
at
some
future
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Marian
,
do
n't
look
so
 
do
n't
talk
so
!
<EOS>
It
does
n't
hurt
me
now
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
showed
me
the
marks
.
<EOS>
I
was
past
grieving
over
them
,
past
crying
over
them
,
past
shuddering
over
them
.
<EOS>
They
say
we
are
either
better
than
men
,
or
worse
.
<EOS>
If
the
temptation
that
has
fallen
in
some
women
's
way
,
and
made
them
worse
,
had
fallen
in
mine
at
that
moment
 
Thank
God
!
<EOS>
my
face
betrayed
nothing
that
his
wife
could
read
.
<EOS>
The
gentle
,
innocent
,
affectionate
creature
thought
I
was
frightened
for
her
and
sorry
for
her
,
and
thought
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
think
too
seriously
of
it
,
Marian
,
"
she
said
simply
,
as
she
pulled
her
sleeve
down
again
.
<EOS>
"
It
does
n't
hurt
me
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
to
think
quietly
of
it
,
my
love
,
for
your
sake
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
well
!
<EOS>
And
you
told
him
all
that
Anne
Catherick
had
said
to
you
 
all
that
you
told
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
all
.
<EOS>
He
insisted
on
it
 
<EOS>
I
was
alone
with
him
 
<EOS>
I
could
conceal
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
he
say
anything
when
you
had
done
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
looked
at
me
,
and
laughed
to
himself
in
a
mocking
,
bitter
way
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
have
the
rest
out
of
you
,
"
he
said
,
"
do
you
hear
?
 
<EOS>
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"
I
declared
to
him
solemnly
that
I
had
told
him
everything
I
knew
.
"
Not
you
,
"
he
answered
,
"
you
know
more
than
you
choose
to
tell
.
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
tell
it
?
<EOS>
You
shall
!
<EOS>
I
'll
wring
it
out
of
you
at
home
if
I
ca
n't
wring
it
out
of
you
here
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
led
me
away
by
a
strange
path
through
the
plantation
 
a
path
where
there
was
no
hope
of
our
meeting
you
 
<EOS>
and
he
spoke
no
more
till
we
came
within
sight
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Then
he
stopped
again
,
and
said
,
"
Will
you
take
a
second
chance
,
if
I
give
it
to
you
?
<EOS>
Will
you
think
better
of
it
,
and
tell
me
the
rest
?
<EOS>
"
I
could
only
repeat
the
same
words
I
had
spoken
before
.
<EOS>
He
cursed
my
obstinacy
,
and
went
on
,
and
took
me
with
him
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
deceive
me
,
"
he
said
,
"
you
know
more
than
you
choose
to
tell
.
<EOS>
I
'll
have
your
secret
out
of
you
,
and
I
'll
have
it
out
of
that
sister
of
yours
as
well
.
<EOS>
There
shall
be
no
more
plotting
and
whispering
between
you
.
<EOS>
Neither
you
nor
she
shall
see
each
other
again
till
you
have
confessed
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
'll
have
you
watched
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
,
till
you
confess
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
He
was
deaf
to
everything
I
could
say
.
<EOS>
He
took
me
straight
upstairs
into
my
own
room
.
<EOS>
Fanny
was
sitting
there
,
doing
some
work
for
me
,
and
he
instantly
ordered
her
out
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
good
care
YOU'RE
not
mixed
up
in
the
conspiracy
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
leave
this
house
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
If
your
mistress
wants
a
maid
,
she
shall
have
one
of
my
choosing
.
"
<EOS>
He
pushed
me
into
the
room
,
and
locked
the
door
on
me
.
<EOS>
He
set
that
senseless
woman
to
watch
me
outside
,
Marian
!
<EOS>
He
looked
and
spoke
like
a
madman
.
<EOS>
You
may
hardly
understand
it
 
he
did
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
understand
it
,
Laura
.
<EOS>
He
is
mad
 
mad
with
the
terrors
of
a
guilty
conscience
.
<EOS>
Every
word
you
have
said
makes
me
positively
certain
that
when
Anne
Catherick
left
you
yesterday
you
were
on
the
eve
of
discovering
a
secret
which
might
have
been
your
vile
husband
's
ruin
,
and
he
thinks
you
HAVE
discovered
it
.
<EOS>
Nothing
you
can
say
or
do
will
quiet
that
guilty
distrust
,
and
convince
his
false
nature
of
your
truth
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
this
,
my
love
,
to
alarm
you
.
<EOS>
I
say
it
to
open
your
eyes
to
your
position
,
and
to
convince
you
of
the
urgent
necessity
of
letting
me
act
,
as
I
best
can
,
for
your
protection
while
the
chance
is
our
own
.
<EOS>
Count
Fosco
's
interference
has
secured
me
access
to
you
to
-
day
,
but
he
may
withdraw
that
interference
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
has
already
dismissed
Fanny
because
she
is
a
quick
-
witted
girl
,
and
devotedly
attached
to
you
,
and
has
chosen
a
woman
to
take
her
place
who
cares
nothing
for
your
interests
,
and
whose
dull
intelligence
lowers
her
to
the
level
of
the
watch
-
dog
in
the
yard
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
say
what
violent
measures
he
may
take
next
,
unless
we
make
the
most
of
our
opportunities
while
we
have
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
can
we
do
,
Marian
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
if
we
could
only
leave
this
house
,
never
to
see
it
again
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
me
,
my
love
,
and
try
to
think
that
you
are
not
quite
helpless
so
long
as
I
am
here
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
think
<EOS>
so
 
I
do
think
so
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
altogether
forget
poor
Fanny
in
thinking
of
me
.
<EOS>
She
wants
help
and
comfort
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
forget
her
.
<EOS>
I
saw
her
before
I
came
up
here
,
and
I
have
arranged
to
communicate
with
her
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Letters
are
not
safe
in
the
post
-
bag
at
Blackwater
Park
,
and
I
shall
have
two
to
write
to
-
day
,
in
your
interests
,
which
must
pass
through
no
hands
but
Fanny
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
letters
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
write
first
,
Laura
,
to
Mr.
Gilmore
's
partner
,
who
has
offered
to
help
us
in
any
fresh
emergency
.
<EOS>
Little
as
I
know
of
the
law
,
I
am
certain
that
it
can
protect
a
woman
from
such
treatment
as
that
ruffian
has
inflicted
on
you
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
into
no
details
about
Anne
Catherick
,
because
I
have
no
certain
information
to
give
.
<EOS>
But
the
lawyer
shall
know
of
those
bruises
on
your
arm
,
and
of
the
violence
offered
to
you
in
this
room
 
he
shall
,
before
I
rest
to
-
night
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
think
of
the
exposure
,
Marian
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
calculating
on
the
exposure
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
has
more
to
dread
from
it
than
you
have
.
<EOS>
The
prospect
of
an
exposure
may
bring
him
to
terms
when
nothing
else
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
rose
as
I
spoke
,
but
Laura
entreated
me
not
to
leave
her
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
drive
him
to
desperation
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
increase
our
dangers
tenfold
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
felt
the
truth
 
the
disheartening
truth
 
of
those
words
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
not
bring
myself
plainly
to
acknowledge
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
In
our
dreadful
position
there
was
no
help
and
no
hope
for
us
but
in
risking
the
worst
.
<EOS>
I
said
so
in
guarded
terms
.
<EOS>
She
sighed
bitterly
,
but
did
not
contest
the
matter
.
<EOS>
She
only
asked
about
the
second
letter
that
I
had
proposed
writing
.
<EOS>
To
whom
was
it
to
be
addressed
?
  
<EOS>
"
To
Mr.
Fairlie
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Your
uncle
is
your
nearest
male
relative
,
and
the
head
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
He
must
and
shall
interfere
.
"
  
<EOS>
Laura
shook
her
head
sorrowfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
I
went
on
,
"
your
uncle
is
a
weak
,
selfish
,
worldly
man
,
I
know
,
but
he
is
not
Sir
Percival
Glyde
,
and
he
has
no
such
friend
about
him
as
Count
Fosco
.
<EOS>
I
expect
nothing
from
his
kindness
or
his
tenderness
of
feeling
towards
you
or
towards
me
,
but
he
will
do
anything
to
pamper
his
own
indolence
,
and
to
secure
his
own
quiet
.
<EOS>
Let
me
only
persuade
him
that
his
interference
at
this
moment
will
save
him
inevitable
trouble
and
wretchedness
and
responsibility
hereafter
,
and
he
will
bestir
himself
for
his
own
sake
.
<EOS>
I
know
how
to
deal
with
him
,
Laura
 
I
have
had
some
practice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
could
only
prevail
on
him
to
let
me
go
back
to
Limmeridge
for
a
little
while
and
stay
there
quietly
with
you
,
Marian
<EOS>
,
I
could
be
almost
as
happy
again
as
I
was
before
I
was
married
!
"
  
<EOS>
Those
words
set
me
thinking
in
a
new
direction
.
<EOS>
Would
it
be
possible
to
place
Sir
Percival
between
the
two
alternatives
of
either
exposing
himself
to
the
scandal
of
legal
interference
on
his
wife
's
behalf
,
or
of
allowing
her
to
be
quietly
separated
from
him
for
a
time
under
pretext
of
a
visit
to
her
uncle
's
house
?
<EOS>
And
could
he
,
in
that
case
,
be
reckoned
on
as
likely
to
accept
the
last
resource
?
<EOS>
It
was
doubtful
 
more
than
doubtful
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
hopeless
as
the
experiment
seemed
,
surely
it
was
worth
trying
.
<EOS>
I
resolved
to
try
it
in
sheer
despair
of
knowing
what
better
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
uncle
shall
know
the
wish
you
have
just
expressed
,
"
I
said
,
"
and
I
will
ask
the
lawyer
's
advice
on
the
subject
as
well
.
<EOS>
Good
may
come
of
it
 
and
will
come
of
it
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Saying
that
I
rose
again
,
and
again
Laura
tried
to
make
me
resume
my
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
leave
me
,
"
she
said
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"
My
desk
is
on
that
table
.
<EOS>
You
can
write
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
tried
me
to
the
quick
to
refuse
her
,
even
in
her
own
interests
.
<EOS>
But
we
had
been
too
long
shut
up
alone
together
already
.
<EOS>
Our
chance
of
seeing
each
other
again
might
entirely
depend
on
our
not
exciting
any
fresh
suspicions
.
<EOS>
It
was
full
time
to
show
myself
,
quietly
and
unconcernedly
,
among
the
wretches
who
were
at
that
very
moment
,
perhaps
,
thinking
of
us
and
talking
of
us
downstairs
.
<EOS>
I
explained
the
miserable
necessity
to
Laura
,
and
prevailed
on
her
to
recognise
it
as
I
did
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
come
back
again
,
love
,
in
an
hour
or
less
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
The
worst
is
over
for
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Keep
yourself
quiet
and
fear
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
the
key
in
the
door
,
Marian
?
<EOS>
Can
I
lock
it
on
the
inside
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
here
is
the
key
.
<EOS>
Lock
the
door
,
and
open
it
to
nobody
until
I
come
upstairs
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
kissed
her
and
left
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
relief
to
me
as
I
walked
away
to
hear
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
,
and
to
know
that
the
door
was
at
her
own
command
.
    
<EOS>
June
19th
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
only
got
as
far
as
the
top
of
the
stairs
when
the
locking
of
Laura
's
door
suggested
to
me
the
precaution
of
also
locking
my
own
door
,
and
keeping
the
key
safely
about
me
while
I
was
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
My
journal
was
already
secured
with
other
papers
in
the
table
drawer
,
but
my
writing
materials
were
left
out
.
<EOS>
These
included
a
seal
bearing
the
common
device
of
two
doves
drinking
out
of
the
same
cup
,
and
some
sheets
of
blotting
-
paper
,
which
had
the
impression
on
them
of
the
closing
lines
of
my
writing
in
these
pages
traced
during
the
past
night
.
<EOS>
Distorted
by
the
suspicion
which
had
now
become
a
part
of
myself
,
even
such
trifles
as
these
looked
too
dangerous
to
be
trusted
without
a
guard
 
even
the
locked
table
drawer
seemed
to
be
not
sufficiently
protected
in
my
absence
until
the
means
of
access
to
it
had
been
carefully
secured
as
well
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
no
appearance
of
any
one
having
entered
the
room
while
I
had
been
talking
with
Laura
.
<EOS>
My
writing
materials
(
which
I
had
given
the
servant
instructions
never
to
meddle
with
)
were
scattered
over
the
table
much
as
usual
.
<EOS>
The
only
circumstance
in
connection
with
them
that
at
all
struck
me
was
that
the
seal
lay
tidily
in
the
tray
with
the
pencils
and
the
wax
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
in
my
careless
habits
(
I
am
sorry
to
say
)
to
put
it
there
,
neither
did
I
remember
putting
it
there
.
<EOS>
But
as
I
could
not
call
to
mind
,
on
the
other
hand
,
where
else
I
had
thrown
it
down
,
and
as
I
was
also
doubtful
whether
I
might
not
for
once
have
laid
it
mechanically
in
the
right
place
,
I
abstained
from
adding
to
the
perplexity
with
which
the
day
's
events
had
filled
my
mind
by
troubling
it
afresh
about
a
trifle
.
<EOS>
I
locked
the
door
,
put
the
key
in
my
pocket
,
and
went
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Fosco
was
alone
in
the
hall
looking
at
the
weather
-
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
Still
falling
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
we
must
expect
more
rain
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
face
was
composed
again
to
its
customary
expression
and
its
customary
colour
.
<EOS>
But
the
hand
with
which
she
pointed
to
the
dial
of
the
weather
-
glass
still
trembled
.
  
<EOS>
Could
she
have
told
her
husband
already
that
she
had
overheard
Laura
reviling
him
,
in
my
company
,
as
a
"
spy
?
"
<EOS>
My
strong
suspicion
that
she
must
have
told
him
,
my
irresistible
dread
(
all
the
more
overpowering
from
its
very
vagueness
)
of
the
consequences
which
might
follow
,
my
fixed
conviction
,
derived
from
various
little
self
-
betrayals
which
women
notice
in
each
other
,
that
Madame
Fosco
,
in
spite
of
her
well
-
assumed
external
civility
,
had
not
forgiven
her
niece
for
innocently
standing
between
her
and
the
legacy
of
ten
thousand
pounds
 
all
rushed
upon
my
mind
together
,
all
impelled
me
to
speak
in
the
vain
hope
of
using
my
own
influence
and
my
own
powers
of
persuasion
for
the
atonement
of
Laura
's
offence
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
trust
to
your
kindness
to
excuse
me
,
Madame
Fosco
,
if
I
venture
to
speak
to
you
on
an
exceedingly
painful
subject
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
crossed
her
hands
in
front
of
her
and
bowed
her
head
solemnly
,
without
uttering
a
word
,
and
without
taking
her
eyes
off
mine
for
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
were
so
good
as
to
bring
me
back
my
handkerchief
,
"
I
went
on
,
"
I
am
very
,
very
much
afraid
you
must
have
accidentally
heard
Laura
say
something
which
I
am
unwilling
to
repeat
,
and
which
I
will
not
attempt
to
defend
.
<EOS>
I
will
only
venture
to
hope
that
you
have
not
thought
it
of
sufficient
importance
to
be
mentioned
to
the
Count
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
of
no
importance
whatever
,
"
said
Madame
Fosco
sharply
and
suddenly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
"
she
added
,
resuming
her
icy
manner
in
a
moment
,
"
I
have
no
secrets
from
my
husband
even
in
trifles
.
<EOS>
When
he
noticed
just
now
that
I
looked
distressed
,
it
was
my
painful
duty
to
tell
him
why
I
was
distressed
,
and
I
frankly
acknowledge
to
you
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
that
I
HAVE
told
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
prepared
to
hear
it
,
and
yet
she
turned
me
cold
all
over
when
she
said
those
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
earnestly
entreat
you
,
Madame
Fosco
 
<EOS>
let
me
earnestly
entreat
the
Count
 
to
make
some
allowances
for
the
sad
position
in
which
my
sister
is
placed
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
while
she
was
smarting
under
the
insult
and
injustice
inflicted
on
her
by
her
husband
,
and
she
was
not
herself
when
she
said
those
rash
words
.
<EOS>
May
I
hope
that
they
will
be
considerately
and
generously
forgiven
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Most
assuredly
,
"
said
the
Count
's
quiet
voice
behind
me
.
<EOS>
He
had
stolen
on
us
with
his
noiseless
tread
and
his
book
in
his
hand
from
the
library
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
Lady
Glyde
said
those
hasty
words
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
she
did
me
an
injustice
which
I
lament
 
and
forgive
.
<EOS>
Let
us
never
return
to
the
subject
,
Miss
Halcombe
;
let
us
all
comfortably
combine
to
forget
it
from
this
moment
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
kind
,
"
I
said
,
"
you
relieve
me
inexpressibly
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
tried
to
continue
,
but
his
eyes
were
on
me
;
his
deadly
smile
that
hides
everything
was
set
,
hard
,
and
unwavering
on
his
broad
,
smooth
face
.
<EOS>
My
distrust
of
his
unfathomable
falseness
,
my
sense
of
my
own
degradation
in
stooping
to
conciliate
his
wife
and
himself
,
so
disturbed
and
confused
me
,
that
the
next
words
failed
on
my
lips
,
and
I
stood
there
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
you
on
my
knees
to
say
no
more
,
Miss
Halcombe
 
<EOS>
I
am
truly
shocked
that
you
should
have
thought
it
necessary
to
say
so
much
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
that
polite
speech
he
took
my
hand
 
<EOS>
oh
,
how
I
despise
myself
!
<EOS>
oh
,
how
little
comfort
there
is
even
in
knowing
that
I
submitted
to
it
for
Laura
's
sake
!
 
<EOS>
he
took
my
hand
and
put
it
to
his
poisonous
lips
.
<EOS>
Never
did
I
know
all
my
horror
of
him
till
then
.
<EOS>
That
innocent
familiarity
turned
my
blood
as
if
it
had
been
the
vilest
insult
that
a
man
could
offer
me
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
hid
my
disgust
from
him
 
<EOS>
I
tried
to
smile
 
I
,
who
once
mercilessly
despised
deceit
in
other
women
,
was
as
false
as
the
worst
of
them
,
as
false
as
the
Judas
whose
lips
had
touched
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
maintained
my
degrading
self
-
control
 
<EOS>
it
is
all
that
redeems
me
in
my
own
estimation
to
know
that
I
could
not
 
if
he
had
still
continued
to
keep
his
eyes
on
my
face
.
<EOS>
His
wife
's
tigerish
jealousy
came
to
my
rescue
and
forced
his
attention
away
from
me
the
moment
he
possessed
himself
of
my
hand
.
<EOS>
Her
cold
blue
eyes
caught
light
,
her
dull
white
cheeks
flushed
into
bright
colour
,
she
looked
years
younger
than
her
age
in
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Count
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Your
foreign
forms
of
politeness
are
not
understood
by
Englishwomen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
my
angel
!
<EOS>
The
best
and
dearest
Englishwoman
in
the
world
understands
them
.
<EOS>
"
With
those
words
he
dropped
my
hand
and
quietly
raised
his
wife
's
hand
to
his
lips
in
place
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
ran
back
up
the
stairs
to
take
refuge
in
my
own
room
.
<EOS>
If
there
had
been
time
to
think
,
my
thoughts
,
when
I
was
alone
again
,
would
have
caused
me
bitter
suffering
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
time
to
think
.
<EOS>
Happily
for
the
preservation
of
my
calmness
and
my
courage
there
was
time
for
nothing
but
action
.
  
<EOS>
The
letters
to
the
lawyer
and
to
Mr.
Fairlie
were
still
to
be
written
,
and
I
sat
down
at
once
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
to
devote
myself
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
multitude
of
resources
to
perplex
me
 
there
was
absolutely
no
one
to
depend
on
,
in
the
first
instance
,
but
myself
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
had
neither
friends
nor
relatives
in
the
neighbourhood
whose
intercession
I
could
attempt
to
employ
.
<EOS>
He
was
on
the
coldest
terms
 
in
some
cases
on
the
worst
terms
with
the
families
of
his
own
rank
and
station
who
lived
near
him
.
<EOS>
We
two
women
had
neither
father
nor
brother
to
come
to
the
house
and
take
our
parts
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
choice
but
to
write
those
two
doubtful
letters
,
or
to
put
Laura
in
the
wrong
and
myself
in
the
wrong
,
and
to
make
all
peaceable
negotiation
in
the
future
impossible
by
secretly
escaping
from
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
Nothing
but
the
most
imminent
personal
peril
could
justify
our
taking
that
second
course
.
<EOS>
The
letters
must
be
tried
first
,
and
I
wrote
them
.
  
<EOS>
I
said
nothing
to
the
lawyer
about
Anne
Catherick
,
because
(
as
I
had
already
hinted
to
Laura
)
<EOS>
that
topic
was
connected
with
a
mystery
which
we
could
not
yet
explain
,
and
which
it
would
therefore
be
useless
to
write
about
to
a
professional
man
.
<EOS>
I
left
my
correspondent
to
attribute
Sir
Percival
's
disgraceful
conduct
,
if
he
pleased
,
to
fresh
disputes
about
money
matters
,
and
simply
consulted
him
on
the
possibility
of
taking
legal
proceedings
for
Laura
's
protection
in
the
event
of
her
husband
's
refusal
to
allow
her
to
leave
Blackwater
Park
for
a
time
and
return
with
me
to
Limmeridge
.
<EOS>
I
referred
him
to
Mr.
Fairlie
for
the
details
of
this
last
arrangement
 
<EOS>
I
assured
him
that
I
wrote
with
Laura
's
authority
 
<EOS>
and
I
ended
by
entreating
him
to
act
in
her
name
to
the
utmost
extent
of
his
power
and
with
the
least
possible
loss
of
time
.
  
<EOS>
The
letter
to
Mr.
Fairlie
occupied
me
next
.
<EOS>
I
appealed
to
him
on
the
terms
which
I
had
mentioned
to
Laura
as
the
most
likely
to
make
him
bestir
himself
;
I
enclosed
a
copy
of
my
letter
to
the
lawyer
to
show
him
how
serious
the
case
was
,
and
I
represented
our
removal
to
Limmeridge
as
the
only
compromise
which
would
prevent
the
danger
and
distress
of
Laura
's
present
position
from
inevitably
affecting
her
uncle
as
well
as
herself
at
no
very
distant
time
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
had
done
,
and
had
sealed
and
directed
the
two
envelopes
,
I
went
back
with
the
letters
to
Laura
's
room
,
to
show
her
that
they
were
written
.
  
<EOS>
"
Has
anybody
disturbed
you
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
asked
,
when
she
opened
the
door
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
has
knocked
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
heard
some
one
in
the
outer
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
a
man
or
a
woman
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
woman
.
<EOS>
I
heard
the
rustling
of
her
gown
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
rustling
like
silk
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
like
silk
.
"
  
<EOS>
Madame
Fosco
had
evidently
been
watching
outside
.
<EOS>
The
mischief
she
might
do
by
herself
was
little
to
be
feared
.
<EOS>
But
the
mischief
she
might
do
,
as
a
willing
instrument
in
her
husband
's
hands
,
was
too
formidable
to
be
overlooked
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
became
of
the
rustling
of
the
gown
when
you
no
longer
heard
it
in
the
ante
-
room
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
hear
it
go
past
your
wall
,
along
the
passage
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
kept
still
and
listened
,
and
just
heard
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Which
way
did
it
go

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Towards
your
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
considered
again
.
<EOS>
The
sound
had
not
caught
my
ears
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
then
deeply
absorbed
in
my
letters
,
and
I
write
with
a
heavy
hand
and
a
quill
pen
,
scraping
and
scratching
noisily
over
the
paper
.
<EOS>
It
was
more
likely
that
Madame
Fosco
would
hear
the
scraping
of
my
pen
than
that
I
should
hear
the
rustling
of
her
dress
.
<EOS>
Another
reason
(
if
I
had
wanted
one
)
for
not
trusting
my
letters
to
the
post
-
bag
in
the
hall
.
  
<EOS>
Laura
saw
me
thinking
.
<EOS>
"
More
difficulties
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
wearily
;
"
more
difficulties
and
more
dangers
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
dangers
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Some
little
difficulty
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
I
am
thinking
of
the
safest
way
of
putting
my
two
letters
into
Fanny
's
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
really
written
them
,
then
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
Marian
,
run
no
risks
 
pray
,
pray
run
no
risks
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
 
no
fear
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
 
what
o'clock
is
it
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
quarter
to
six
.
<EOS>
There
would
be
time
for
me
to
get
to
the
village
inn
,
and
to
come
back
again
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
If
I
waited
till
the
evening
I
might
find
no
second
opportunity
of
safely
leaving
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
.
<EOS>
Laura
,
"
I
said
,
"
and
do
n't
be
afraid
about
me
.
<EOS>
If
you
hear
any
inquiries
made
,
call
through
the
door
,
and
say
that
I
am
gone
out
for
a
walk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
shall
you
be
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Before
dinner
,
without
fail
.
<EOS>
Courage
,
my
love
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
to
-
morrow
you
will
have
a
clear
-
headed
,
trustworthy
man
acting
for
your
good
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gilmore
's
partner
is
our
next
best
friend
to
Mr.
Gilmore
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
moment
's
reflection
,
as
soon
as
I
was
alone
,
convinced
me
that
I
had
better
not
appear
in
my
walking
-
dress
until
I
had
first
discovered
what
was
going
on
in
the
lower
part
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
ascertained
yet
whether
Sir
Percival
was
indoors
or
out
.
  
<EOS>
The
singing
of
the
canaries
in
the
library
,
and
the
smell
of
tobacco
-
smoke
that
came
through
the
door
,
which
was
not
closed
,
told
me
at
once
where
the
Count
was
.
<EOS>
I
looked
over
my
shoulder
as
I
passed
the
doorway
,
and
saw
to
my
surprise
that
he
was
exhibiting
the
docility
of
the
birds
in
his
most
engagingly
polite
manner
to
the
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
specially
invited
her
to
see
them
 
for
she
would
never
have
thought
of
going
into
the
library
of
her
own
accord
.
<EOS>
The
man
's
slightest
actions
had
a
purpose
of
some
kind
at
the
bottom
of
every
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
What
could
be
his
purpose
here
?
  
<EOS>
It
was
no
time
then
to
inquire
into
his
motives
.
<EOS>
I
looked
about
for
Madame
Fosco
next
,
and
found
her
following
her
favourite
circle
round
and
round
the
fish
-
pond
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
a
little
doubtful
how
she
would
meet
me
,
after
the
outbreak
of
jealousy
of
which
I
had
been
the
cause
<EOS>
so
short
a
time
since
.
<EOS>
But
her
husband
had
tamed
her
in
the
interval
,
and
she
now
spoke
to
me
with
the
same
civility
as
usual
.
<EOS>
My
only
object
in
addressing
myself
to
her
was
to
ascertain
if
she
knew
what
had
become
of
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
I
contrived
to
refer
to
him
indirectly
,
and
after
a
little
fencing
on
either
side
she
at
last
mentioned
that
he
had
gone
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Which
of
the
horses
has
he
taken
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
carelessly
.
  
<EOS>
"
None
of
them
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
went
away
two
hours
since
on
foot
.
<EOS>
As
I
understood
it
,
his
object
was
to
make
fresh
inquiries
about
the
woman
named
Anne
Catherick
.
<EOS>
He
appears
to
be
unreasonably
anxious
about
tracing
her
.
<EOS>
Do
you
happen
to
know
if
she
is
dangerously
mad
,
Miss
Halcombe
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
,
Countess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
in
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
will
soon
be
time
to
dress
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
entered
the
house
together
.
<EOS>
Madame
Fosco
strolled
into
the
library
,
and
closed
the
door
.
<EOS>
I
went
at
once
to
fetch
my
hat
and
shawl
.
<EOS>
Every
moment
was
of
importance
,
if
I
was
to
get
to
Fanny
at
the
inn
and
be
back
before
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
crossed
the
hall
again
no
one
was
there
,
and
the
singing
of
the
birds
in
the
library
had
ceased
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
stop
to
make
any
fresh
investigations
.
<EOS>
I
could
only
assure
myself
that
the
way
was
clear
,
and
then
leave
the
house
with
the
two
letters
safe
in
my
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
On
my
way
to
the
village
I
prepared
myself
for
the
possibility
of
meeting
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
I
had
him
to
deal
with
alone
<EOS>
I
felt
certain
of
not
losing
my
presence
of
mind
.
<EOS>
Any
woman
who
is
sure
of
her
own
wits
is
a
match
at
any
time
for
a
man
who
is
not
sure
of
his
own
temper
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
such
fear
of
Sir
Percival
as
I
had
of
the
Count
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
fluttering
,
it
had
composed
me
,
to
hear
of
the
errand
on
which
he
had
gone
out
.
<EOS>
While
the
tracing
of
Anne
Catherick
was
the
great
anxiety
that
occupied
him
,
Laura
and
I
might
hope
for
some
cessation
of
any
active
persecution
at
his
hands
.
<EOS>
For
our
sakes
now
,
as
well
as
for
Anne
's
,
I
hoped
and
prayed
fervently
that
she
might
still
escape
him
.
  
<EOS>
I
walked
on
as
briskly
as
the
heat
would
let
me
till
I
reached
the
cross
-
road
which
led
to
the
village
,
looking
back
from
time
to
time
to
make
sure
that
I
was
not
followed
by
any
one
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
was
behind
me
all
the
way
but
an
empty
country
waggon
.
<EOS>
The
noise
made
by
the
lumbering
wheels
annoyed
me
,
and
when
I
found
that
the
waggon
took
the
road
to
the
village
,
as
well
as
myself
,
I
stopped
to
let
it
go
by
and
pass
out
of
hearing
.
<EOS>
As
I
looked
toward
it
,
more
attentively
than
before
,
I
thought
I
detected
at
intervals
the
feet
of
a
man
walking
close
behind
it
,
the
carter
being
in
front
,
by
the
side
of
his
horses
.
<EOS>
The
part
of
the
cross
-
road
which
I
had
just
passed
over
was
so
narrow
that
the
waggon
coming
after
me
brushed
the
trees
and
thickets
on
either
side
,
and
I
had
to
wait
until
it
went
by
before
I
could
test
the
correctness
of
my
impression
.
<EOS>
Apparently
that
impression
was
wrong
,
for
when
the
waggon
had
passed
me
the
road
behind
it
was
quite
clear
.
  
<EOS>
I
reached
the
inn
without
meeting
Sir
Percival
,
and
without
noticing
anything
more
,
and
was
glad
to
find
that
the
landlady
had
received
Fanny
with
all
possible
kindness
.
<EOS>
The
girl
had
a
little
parlour
to
sit
in
,
away
from
the
noise
of
the
taproom
,
and
a
clean
bedchamber
at
the
top
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
began
crying
again
at
the
sight
of
me
,
and
said
,
poor
soul
,
truly
enough
,
that
it
was
dreadful
to
feel
herself
turned
out
into
the
world
as
if
she
had
committed
some
unpardonable
fault
,
when
no
blame
could
be
laid
at
her
door
by
anybody
 
not
even
by
her
master
,
who
had
sent
her
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Try
to
make
the
best
of
it
,
Fanny
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Your
mistress
and
I
will
stand
your
friends
,
and
will
take
care
that
your
character
shall
not
suffer
.
<EOS>
Now
,
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
very
little
time
to
spare
,
and
I
am
going
to
put
a
great
trust
in
your
hands
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
to
take
care
of
these
two
letters
.
<EOS>
The
one
with
the
stamp
on
it
<EOS>
you
are
to
put
into
the
post
when
you
reach
London
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
The
other
,
directed
to
Mr.
Fairlie
,
you
are
to
deliver
to
him
yourself
as
soon
as
you
get
home
.
<EOS>
Keep
both
the
letters
about
you
and
give
them
up
to
no
one
.
<EOS>
They
are
of
the
last
importance
to
your
mistress
's
interests
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fanny
put
the
letters
into
the
bosom
of
her
dress
.
<EOS>
"
There
they
shall
stop
,
miss
,
"
she
said
,
"
till
I
have
done
what
you
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mind
you
are
at
the
station
in
good
time
to
-
morrow
morning
,
"
I
continued
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
when
you
see
the
housekeeper
at
Limmeridge
give
her
my
compliments
,
and
say
that
you
are
in
my
service
until
Lady
Glyde
is
able
to
take
you
back
.
<EOS>
We
may
meet
again
sooner
than
you
think
.
<EOS>
So
keep
a
good
heart
,
and
do
n't
miss
the
seven
o'clock
train
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
miss
 
thank
you
kindly
.
<EOS>
It
gives
one
courage
to
hear
your
voice
again
.
<EOS>
Please
to
offer
my
duty
to
my
lady
,
and
say
I
left
all
the
things
as
tidy
as
I
could
in
the
time
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
dear
!
<EOS>
dear
!
<EOS>
who
will
dress
her
for
dinner
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
It
really
breaks
my
heart
,
miss
,
to
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
I
got
back
to
the
house
I
had
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
spare
to
put
myself
in
order
for
dinner
,
and
to
say
two
words
to
Laura
before
I
went
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
letters
are
in
Fanny
's
hands
,
"
I
whispered
to
her
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
to
join
us
at
dinner
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
no
 
not
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Has
anything
happened
?
<EOS>
Has
any
one
disturbed
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
just
now
 
Sir
Percival
 
"
  
"
Did
he
come
in
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
he
frightened
me
by
a
thump
on
the
door
outside
.
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
Who
's
there
?
"
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
alter
your
mind
,
and
tell
me
the
rest
?
<EOS>
You
shall
!
<EOS>
Sooner
or
later
I
'll
wring
it
out
of
you
.
<EOS>
You
know
where
Anne
Catherick
is
at
this
moment
.
"
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
indeed
,
"
I
said
,
"
I
do
n't
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
do
!
"
<EOS>
he
called
back
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
crush
your
obstinacy
 
mind
that
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
wring
it
out
of
you
!
"
<EOS>
He
went
away
with
those
words
 
went
away
,
Marian
,
hardly
five
minutes
ago
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
not
found
Anne
!
<EOS>
We
were
safe
for
that
night
 
he
had
not
found
her
yet
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
going
downstairs
,
Marian
?
<EOS>
Come
up
again
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
uneasy
if
I
am
a
little
late
 
<EOS>
I
must
be
careful
not
to
give
offence
by
leaving
them
too
soon
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
dinner
-
bell
rang
<EOS>
and
I
hastened
away
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
took
Madame
Fosco
into
the
dining
-
room
,
and
the
Count
gave
me
his
arm
.
<EOS>
He
was
hot
and
flushed
,
and
was
not
dressed
with
his
customary
care
and
completeness
.
<EOS>
Had
he
,
too
,
been
out
before
dinner
,
and
been
late
in
getting
back
?
<EOS>
or
was
he
only
suffering
from
the
heat
a
little
more
severely
than
usual
?
  
<EOS>
However
this
might
be
,
he
was
unquestionably
troubled
by
some
secret
annoyance
or
anxiety
,
which
,
with
all
his
powers
of
deception
,
he
was
not
able
entirely
to
conceal
.
<EOS>
Through
the
whole
of
dinner
he
was
almost
as
silent
as
Sir
Percival
himself
,
and
he
,
every
now
and
then
,
looked
at
his
wife
with
an
expression
of
furtive
uneasiness
which
was
quite
new
in
my
experience
of
him
.
<EOS>
The
one
social
obligation
which
he
seemed
to
be
self
-
possessed
enough
to
perform
as
carefully
as
ever
was
the
obligation
of
being
persistently
civil
and
attentive
to
me
.
<EOS>
What
vile
object
he
has
in
view
I
can
not
still
discover
,
but
be
the
design
what
it
may
,
invariable
politeness
towards
myself
,
invariable
humility
towards
Laura
,
and
invariable
suppression
(
at
any
cost
)
of
Sir
Percival
's
clumsy
violence
,
<EOS>
have
been
the
means
he
has
resolutely
and
impenetrably
used
to
get
to
his
end
ever
since
he
set
foot
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
I
suspected
it
when
he
first
interfered
in
our
favour
,
on
the
day
when
the
deed
was
produced
in
the
library
,
and
I
feel
certain
of
it
now
.
  
<EOS>
When
Madame
Fosco
and
I
rose
to
leave
the
table
,
the
Count
rose
also
to
accompany
us
back
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
going
away
for
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Sir
Percival
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
YOU
,
Fosco
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
away
because
I
have
had
dinner
enough
,
and
wine
enough
,
"
answered
the
Count
.
"
<EOS>
Be
so
kind
,
Percival
,
as
to
make
allowances
for
my
foreign
habit
of
going
out
with
the
ladies
,
as
well
as
coming
in
with
them

Nonsense

Another
glass
of
claret
wo
n't

you

<EOS>
Sit
down
again
like
an
Englishman
.
<EOS>
I
want
half
an
hour
's
quiet
talk
with
you
over
our
wine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
quiet
talk
,
Percival
,
with
all
my
heart
,
but
not
now
,
and
not
over
the
wine
.
<EOS>
Later
in
the
evening
,
if
you
please
 
later
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Civil
!
"
said
Sir
Percival
savagely
.
"
<EOS>
Civil
behaviour
,
upon
my
soul
,
to
a
man
in
his
own
house
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
more
than
once
seen
him
look
at
the
Count
uneasily
during
dinner
-
time
,
and
had
observed
that
the
Count
carefully
abstained
from
looking
at
him
in
return
.
<EOS>
This
circumstance
,
coupled
with
the
host
's
anxiety
for
a
little
quiet
talk
over
the
wine
,
and
the
guest
's
obstinate
resolution
not
to
sit
down
again
at
the
table
,
revived
in
my
memory
the
request
which
Sir
Percival
had
vainly
addressed
to
his
friend
earlier
in
the
day
to
come
out
of
the
library
and
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
Count
had
deferred
granting
that
private
interview
,
when
it
was
first
asked
for
in
the
afternoon
,
and
had
again
deferred
granting
it
,
when
it
was
a
second
time
asked
for
at
the
dinner
-
table
.
<EOS>
Whatever
the
coming
subject
of
discussion
between
them
might
be
,
it
was
clearly
an
important
subject
in
Sir
Percival
's
estimation
 
and
perhaps
(
judging
from
his
evident
reluctance
to
approach
it
)
a
dangerous
subject
as
well
,
in
the
estimation
of
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
These
considerations
occurred
to
me
while
we
were
passing
from
the
dining
-
room
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
's
angry
commentary
on
his
friend
's
desertion
of
him
had
not
produced
the
slightest
effect
.
<EOS>
The
Count
obstinately
accompanied
us
to
the
tea
-
table
 
waited
a
minute
or
two
in
the
room
 
went
out
into
the
hall
 
and
returned
with
the
post
-
bag
in
his
hands
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
eight
o'clock
 
the
hour
at
which
the
letters
were
always
despatched
from
Blackwater
Park
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
any
letter
for
the
post
,
Miss
Halcombe
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
approaching
me
with
the
bag
.
  
<EOS>
I
saw
Madame
Fosco
,
who
was
making
the
tea
,
pause
,
with
the
sugar
-
tongs
in
her
hand
,
to
listen
for
my
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Count
,
thank
you
.
<EOS>
No
letters
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
gave
the
bag
to
the
servant
,
who
was
then
in
the
room
;
sat
down
at
the
piano
,
and
played
the
air
of
the
lively
Neapolitan
street
-
song
,
"
La
mia
Carolina
,
"
twice
over
.
<EOS>
His
wife
,
who
was
usually
the
most
deliberate
of
women
in
all
her
movements
,
made
the
tea
as
quickly
as
I
could
have
made
it
myself
 
finished
her
own
cup
in
two
minutes
,
and
quietly
glided
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
rose
to
follow
her
example
 
partly
because
I
suspected
her
of
attempting
some
treachery
upstairs
with
Laura
,
partly
because
I
was
resolved
not
to
remain
alone
in
the
same
room
with
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
Before
I
could
get
to
the
door
the
Count
stopped
me
,
by
a
request
for
a
cup
of
tea
.
<EOS>
I
gave
him
the
cup
of
tea
,
and
tried
a
second
time
to
get
away
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
me
again
 
this
time
by
going
back
to
the
piano
,
and
suddenly
appealing
to
me
on
a
musical
question
in
which
he
declared
that
the
honour
of
his
country
was
concerned
.
  
<EOS>
I
vainly
pleaded
my
own
total
ignorance
of
music
,
and
total
want
of
taste
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
He
only
appealed
to
me
again
with
a
vehemence
which
set
all
further
protest
on
my
part
at
defiance
.
"
<EOS>
The
English
and
the
Germans
(
he
indignantly
declared
)
were
always
reviling
the
Italians
for
their
inability
to
cultivate
the
higher
kinds
of
music
.
<EOS>
We
were
perpetually
talking
of
our
Oratorios
,
and
they
were
perpetually
talking
of
their
Symphonies
.
<EOS>
Did
we
forget
and
did
they
forget
his
immortal
friend
and
countryman
,
Rossini
?
<EOS>
What
was
Moses
in
Egypt
but
a
sublime
oratorio
,
which
was
acted
on
the
stage
instead
of
being
coldly
sung
in
a
concert
-
room
?
<EOS>
What
was
the
overture
to
Guillaume
Tell
but
a
symphony
under
another
name
?
<EOS>
Had
I
heard
Moses
in
Egypt
?
<EOS>
Would
I
listen
to
this
,
and
this
,
and
this
,
and
say
if
anything
more
sublimely
sacred
and
grand
had
ever
been
composed
by
mortal
man
?
"
 
<EOS>
And
without
waiting
for
a
word
of
assent
or
dissent
on
my
part
,
looking
me
hard
in
the
face
all
the
time
,
he
began
thundering
on
the
piano
,
and
singing
to
it
with
loud
and
lofty
enthusiasm
 
only
interrupting
himself
,
at
intervals
,
to
announce
to
me
fiercely
the
titles
of
the
different
pieces
of
music
:
"
Chorus
of
Egyptians
in
the
Plague
of
Darkness
,
Miss
Halcombe
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Recitativo
of
Moses
with
the
tables
of
the
Law
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Prayer
of
Israelites
,
at
the
passage
of
the
Red
Sea
.
<EOS>
Aha
!
<EOS>
Aha
!
<EOS>
Is
that
sacred
?
<EOS>
is
that
sublime
?
"
<EOS>
The
piano
trembled
under
his
powerful
hands
,
and
the
teacups
on
the
table
rattled
,
as
his
big
bass
voice
thundered
out
the
notes
,
and
his
heavy
foot
beat
time
on
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
horrible
 
something
fierce
and
devilish
 
in
the
outburst
of
his
delight
at
his
own
singing
and
playing
,
and
in
the
triumph
with
which
he
watched
its
effect
upon
me
as
I
shrank
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
I
was
released
at
last
,
not
by
my
own
efforts
,
but
by
Sir
Percival
's
interposition
.
<EOS>
He
opened
the
dining
-
room
door
,
and
called
out
angrily
to
know
what
"
that
infernal
noise
"
meant
.
<EOS>
The
Count
instantly
got
up
from
the
piano
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
if
Percival
is
coming
,
"
he
said
,
"
harmony
and
melody
are
both
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
The
Muse
of
Music
,
Miss
Halcombe
,
deserts
us
in
dismay
,
and
I
,
the
fat
old
minstrel
,
exhale
the
rest
of
my
enthusiasm
in
the
open
air
!
"
<EOS>
He
stalked
out
into
the
verandah
,
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
resumed
the
Recitativo
of
Moses
,
sotto
voce
,
in
the
garden
.
  
<EOS>
I
heard
Sir
Percival
call
after
him
from
the
dining
-
room
window
.
<EOS>
But
he
took
no
notice
 
<EOS>
he
seemed
determined
not
to
hear
.
<EOS>
That
long
-
deferred
quiet
talk
between
them
was
still
to
be
put
off
,
was
still
to
wait
for
the
Count
's
absolute
will
and
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
detained
me
in
the
drawing
-
room
nearly
half
an
hour
from
the
time
when
his
wife
left
us
.
<EOS>
Where
had
she
been
,
and
what
had
she
been
doing
in
that
interval
?
  
<EOS>
I
went
upstairs
to
ascertain
,
but
I
made
no
discoveries
,
and
when
I
questioned
Laura
,
I
found
that
she
had
not
heard
anything
.
<EOS>
Nobody
had
disturbed
her
,
no
faint
rustling
of
the
silk
dress
had
been
audible
,
either
in
the
ante
-
room
or
in
the
passage
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
then
twenty
minutes
to
nine
.
<EOS>
After
going
to
my
room
to
get
my
journal
,
I
returned
,
and
sat
with
Laura
,
sometimes
writing
,
sometimes
stopping
to
talk
with
her
.
<EOS>
Nobody
came
near
us
,
and
nothing
happened
.
<EOS>
We
remained
together
till
ten
o'clock
.
<EOS>
I
then
rose
,
said
my
last
cheering
words
,
and
wished
her
good
-
night
.
<EOS>
She
locked
her
door
again
after
we
had
arranged
that
I
should
come
in
and
see
her
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
a
few
sentences
more
to
add
to
my
diary
before
going
to
bed
myself
,
and
as
I
went
down
again
to
the
drawing
-
room
after
leaving
Laura
for
the
last
time
that
weary
day
,
I
resolved
merely
to
show
myself
there
,
to
make
my
excuses
,
and
then
to
retire
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
for
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
,
and
the
Count
and
his
wife
,
were
sitting
together
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
was
yawning
in
an
easy
-
chair
,
the
Count
was
reading
,
Madame
Fosco
was
fanning
herself
.
<EOS>
Strange
to
say
,
HER
face
was
flushed
now
.
<EOS>
She
,
who
never
suffered
from
the
heat
,
was
most
undoubtedly
suffering
from
it
to
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
Countess
,
you
are
not
quite
so
well
as
usual
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
very
remark
<EOS>
I
was
about
to
make
to
you
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
looking
pale
,
my
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
dear
!
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
addressed
me
with
that
familiarity
!
<EOS>
There
was
an
insolent
smile
too
on
her
face
when
she
said
the
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
suffering
from
one
of
my
bad
headaches
,
"
I
answered
coldly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
indeed
?
<EOS>
Want
of
exercise
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
A
walk
before
dinner
would
have
been
just
the
thing
for
you
.
"
<EOS>
She
referred
to
the
"
walk
"
with
a
strange
emphasis
.
<EOS>
Had
she
seen
me
go
out
?
<EOS>
No
matter
if
she
had
.
<EOS>
The
letters
were
safe
now
in
Fanny
's
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
and
have
a
smoke
,
Fosco
,
"
said
Sir
Percival
,
rising
,
with
another
uneasy
look
at
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
With
pleasure
,
Percival
,
when
the
ladies
have
gone
to
bed
,
"
replied
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
Countess
,
if
I
set
you
the
example
of
retiring
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
The
only
remedy
for
such
a
headache
as
mine
is
going
to
bed
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
took
my
leave
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
same
insolent
smile
on
the
woman
's
face
when
I
shook
hands
with
her
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
paid
no
attention
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
was
looking
impatiently
at
Madame
Fosco
,
who
showed
no
signs
of
leaving
the
room
with
me
.
<EOS>
The
Count
smiled
to
himself
behind
his
book
.
<EOS>
There
was
yet
another
delay
to
that
quiet
talk
with
Sir
Percival
 
and
<EOS>
the
Countess
was
the
impediment
this
time
.
    
<EOS>
June
19th
.
 
<EOS>
Once
safely
shut
into
my
own
room
,
I
opened
these
pages
,
and
prepared
to
go
on
with
that
part
of
the
day
's
record
which
was
still
left
to
write
.
  
<EOS>
For
ten
minutes
or
more
I
sat
idle
,
with
the
pen
in
my
hand
,
thinking
over
the
events
of
the
last
twelve
hours
.
<EOS>
When
I
at
last
addressed
myself
to
my
task
,
I
found
a
difficulty
in
proceeding
with
it
which
I
had
never
experienced
before
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
my
efforts
to
fix
my
thoughts
on
the
matter
in
hand
,
they
wandered
away
with
the
strangest
persistency
in
the
one
direction
of
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
,
and
all
the
interest
which
I
tried
to
concentrate
on
my
journal
centred
instead
in
that
private
interview
between
them
which
had
been
put
off
all
through
the
day
,
and
which
was
now
to
take
place
in
the
silence
and
solitude
of
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
perverse
state
of
my
mind
,
the
recollection
of
what
had
passed
since
the
morning
would
not
come
back
to
me
,
and
there
was
no
resource
but
to
close
my
journal
and
to
get
away
from
it
for
a
little
while
.
  
<EOS>
I
opened
the
door
which
led
from
my
bedroom
into
my
sitting
-
room
,
and
having
passed
through
,
pulled
it
to
again
,
to
prevent
any
accident
in
case
of
draught
with
the
candle
left
on
the
dressing
-
table
.
<EOS>
My
sitting
-
room
window
was
wide
open
,
and
I
leaned
out
listlessly
to
look
at
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
dark
and
quiet
.
<EOS>
Neither
moon
nor
stars
were
visible
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
smell
like
rain
in
the
still
,
heavy
air
,
and
I
put
my
hand
out
of
window
.
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
The
rain
was
only
threatening
,
it
had
not
come
yet
.
  
<EOS>
I
remained
leaning
on
the
window
-
sill
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
looking
out
absently
into
the
black
darkness
,
and
hearing
nothing
,
except
now
and
then
the
voices
of
the
servants
,
or
the
distant
sound
of
a
closing
door
,
in
the
lower
part
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Just
as
I
was
turning
away
wearily
from
the
window
to
go
back
to
the
bedroom
and
make
a
second
attempt
to
complete
the
unfinished
entry
in
my
journal
,
I
smelt
the
odour
of
tobacco
-
smoke
stealing
towards
me
on
the
heavy
night
air
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
I
saw
a
tiny
red
spark
advancing
from
the
farther
end
of
the
house
in
the
pitch
darkness
.
<EOS>
I
heard
no
footsteps
,
and
I
could
see
nothing
but
the
spark
.
<EOS>
It
travelled
along
in
the
night
,
passed
the
window
at
which
I
was
standing
,
and
stopped
opposite
my
bedroom
window
,
inside
which
I
had
left
the
light
burning
on
the
dressing
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
The
spark
remained
stationary
for
a
moment
,
then
moved
back
again
in
the
direction
from
which
it
had
advanced
.
<EOS>
As
I
followed
its
progress
I
saw
a
second
red
spark
,
larger
than
the
first
,
approaching
from
the
distance
.
<EOS>
The
two
met
together
in
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
Remembering
who
smoked
cigarettes
and
who
smoked
cigars
,
I
inferred
immediately
that
the
Count
had
come
out
first
to
look
and
listen
under
my
window
,
and
that
Sir
Percival
had
afterwards
joined
him
.
<EOS>
They
must
both
have
been
walking
on
the
lawn
 
<EOS>
or
I
should
certainly
have
heard
Sir
Percival
's
heavy
footfall
,
though
the
Count
's
soft
step
might
have
escaped
me
,
even
on
the
gravel
walk
.
  
<EOS>
I
waited
quietly
at
the
window
,
certain
that
they
could
neither
of
them
see
me
in
the
darkness
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
I
heard
Sir
Percival
say
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
come
in
and
sit
down
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
see
the
light
out
of
that
window
,
"
replied
the
Count
softly
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
harm
does
the
light
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
shows
she
is
not
in
bed
yet
.
<EOS>
She
is
sharp
enough
to
suspect
something
,
and
bold
enough
to
come
downstairs
and
listen
,
if
she
can
get
the
chance
.
<EOS>
Patience
,
Percival
 
patience
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Humbug
!
<EOS>
You
're
always
talking
of
patience
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
talk
of
something
else
presently
.
<EOS>
My
good
friend
,
you
are
on
the
edge
of
your
domestic
precipice
,
and
if
I
let
you
give
the
women
one
other
chance
,
on
my
sacred
word
of
honour
they
will
push
you
over
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
come
to
our
explanations
,
Percival
,
when
the
light
is
out
of
that
window
,
and
when
I
have
had
one
little
look
at
the
rooms
on
each
side
of
the
library
,
and
a
peep
at
the
staircase
as
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
slowly
moved
away
,
and
the
rest
of
the
conversation
between
them
(
which
had
been
conducted
throughout
in
the
same
low
tones
)
ceased
to
be
audible
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
matter
.
<EOS>
I
had
heard
enough
to
determine
me
on
justifying
the
Count
's
opinion
of
my
sharpness
and
my
courage
.
<EOS>
Before
the
red
sparks
were
out
of
sight
in
the
darkness
I
had
made
up
my
mind
that
there
should
be
a
listener
when
those
two
men
sat
down
to
their
talk
 
and
that
the
listener
,
in
spite
of
all
the
Count
's
precautions
to
the
contrary
,
should
be
myself
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
but
one
motive
to
sanction
the
act
to
my
own
conscience
,
and
to
give
me
courage
enough
for
performing
it
 
and
that
motive
I
had
.
<EOS>
Laura
's
honour
,
Laura
's
happiness
 
Laura
's
life
itself
 
might
depend
on
my
quick
ears
and
my
faithful
memory
to
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
heard
the
Count
say
that
he
meant
to
examine
the
rooms
on
each
side
of
the
library
,
and
the
staircase
as
well
,
before
he
entered
on
any
explanation
with
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
This
expression
of
his
intentions
was
necessarily
sufficient
to
inform
me
that
the
library
was
the
room
in
which
he
proposed
that
the
conversation
should
take
place
.
<EOS>
The
one
moment
of
time
which
was
long
enough
to
bring
me
to
that
conclusion
was
also
the
moment
which
showed
me
a
means
of
baffling
his
precautions
 
or
,
in
other
words
,
of
hearing
what
he
and
Sir
Percival
said
to
each
other
,
without
the
risk
of
descending
at
all
into
the
lower
regions
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
In
speaking
of
the
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
I
have
mentioned
incidentally
the
verandah
outside
them
,
on
which
they
all
opened
by
means
of
French
windows
,
extending
from
the
cornice
to
the
floor
.
<EOS>
The
top
of
this
verandah
was
flat
,
the
rain
-
water
being
carried
off
from
it
by
pipes
into
tanks
which
helped
to
supply
the
house
.
<EOS>
On
the
narrow
leaden
roof
,
which
ran
along
past
the
bedrooms
,
and
which
was
rather
less
,
I
should
think
,
than
three
feet
below
the
sills
of
the
window
,
a
row
of
flower
-
pots
was
ranged
,
with
wide
intervals
between
each
pot
 
<EOS>
the
whole
being
protected
from
falling
in
high
winds
by
an
ornamental
iron
railing
along
the
edge
of
the
roof
.
  
<EOS>
The
plan
which
had
now
occurred
to
me
was
to
get
out
at
my
sitting
-
room
window
on
to
this
roof
,
to
creep
along
noiselessly
till
I
reached
that
part
of
it
which
was
immediately
over
the
library
window
,
and
to
crouch
down
between
the
flower
-
pots
,
with
my
ear
against
the
outer
railing
.
<EOS>
If
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
sat
and
smoked
to
-
night
,
as
I
had
seen
them
sitting
and
smoking
many
nights
before
,
with
their
chairs
close
at
the
open
window
,
and
their
feet
stretched
on
the
zinc
garden
seats
which
were
placed
under
the
verandah
,
every
word
they
said
to
each
other
above
a
whisper
(
and
no
long
conversation
,
as
we
all
know
by
experience
,
can
be
carried
on
IN
a
whisper
)
must
inevitably
reach
my
ears
.
<EOS>
If
,
on
the
other
hand
,
they
chose
to
-
night
to
sit
far
back
inside
the
room
,
then
the
chances
were
that
I
should
hear
little
or
nothing
 
and
in
that
case
,
I
must
run
the
far
more
serious
risk
of
trying
to
outwit
them
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
Strongly
as
I
was
fortified
in
my
resolution
by
the
desperate
nature
of
our
situation
,
I
hoped
most
fervently
that
I
might
escape
this
last
emergency
.
<EOS>
My
courage
was
only
a
woman
's
courage
after
all
,
and
it
was
very
near
to
failing
me
when
I
thought
of
trusting
myself
on
the
ground
floor
,
at
the
dead
of
night
,
within
reach
of
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
softly
back
to
my
bedroom
to
try
the
safer
experiment
of
the
verandah
roof
first
.
  
<EOS>
A
complete
change
in
my
dress
was
imperatively
necessary
for
many
reasons
.
<EOS>
I
took
off
my
silk
gown
to
begin
with
,
because
the
slightest
noise
from
it
on
that
still
night
might
have
betrayed
me
.
<EOS>
I
next
removed
the
white
and
cumbersome
parts
of
my
underclothing
,
and
replaced
them
by
a
petticoat
of
dark
flannel
.
<EOS>
Over
this
I
put
my
black
travelling
cloak
,
and
pulled
the
hood
on
to
my
head
.
<EOS>
In
my
ordinary
evening
costume
I
took
up
the
room
of
three
men
at
least
.
<EOS>
In
my
present
dress
,
when
it
was
held
close
about
me
,
no
man
could
have
passed
through
the
narrowest
spaces
more
easily
than
I.
<EOS>
The
little
breadth
left
on
the
roof
of
the
verandah
,
between
the
flower
-
pots
on
one
side
and
the
wall
and
the
windows
of
the
house
on
the
other
,
made
this
a
serious
consideration
.
<EOS>
If
I
knocked
anything
down
,
if
I
made
the
least
noise
,
who
could
say
what
the
consequences
might
be
?
  
<EOS>
I
only
waited
to
put
the
matches
near
the
candle
before
I
extinguished
it
,
and
groped
my
way
back
into
the
sitting
-
room
<EOS>
,
I
locked
that
door
,
as
I
had
locked
my
bedroom
door
 
then
quietly
got
out
of
the
window
,
and
cautiously
set
my
feet
on
the
leaden
roof
of
the
verandah
.
  
<EOS>
My
two
rooms
were
at
the
inner
extremity
of
the
new
wing
of
the
house
in
which
we
all
lived
,
and
I
had
five
windows
to
pass
before
I
could
reach
the
position
it
was
necessary
to
take
up
immediately
over
the
library
.
<EOS>
The
first
window
belonged
to
a
spare
room
which
was
empty
.
<EOS>
The
second
and
third
windows
belonged
to
Laura
's
room
.
<EOS>
The
fourth
window
belonged
to
Sir
Percival
's
room
.
<EOS>
The
fifth
belonged
to
the
Countess
's
room
.
<EOS>
The
others
,
by
which
it
was
not
necessary
for
me
to
pass
,
were
the
windows
of
the
Count
's
dressing
-
room
,
of
the
bathroom
,
and
of
the
second
empty
spare
room
.
  
<EOS>
No
sound
reached
my
ears
 
<EOS>
the
black
blinding
darkness
of
the
night
was
all
round
me
when
I
first
stood
on
the
verandah
,
except
at
that
part
of
it
which
Madame
Fosco
's
window
overlooked
.
<EOS>
There
,
at
the
very
place
above
the
library
to
which
my
course
was
directed
 
there
<EOS>
I
saw
a
gleam
of
light
!
<EOS>
The
Countess
was
not
yet
in
bed
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
too
late
to
draw
back
 
<EOS>
it
was
no
time
to
wait
.
<EOS>
I
determined
to
go
on
at
all
hazards
,
and
trust
for
security
to
my
own
caution
and
to
the
darkness
of
the
night
.
"
<EOS>
For
Laura
's
sake
!
<EOS>
"
I
thought
to
myself
,
as
I
took
the
first
step
forward
on
the
roof
,
with
one
hand
holding
my
cloak
close
round
me
,
and
the
other
groping
against
the
wall
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
was
better
to
brush
close
by
the
wall
than
to
risk
striking
my
feet
against
the
flower
-
pots
within
a
few
inches
of
me
,
on
the
other
side
.
  
<EOS>
I
passed
the
dark
window
of
the
spare
room
,
trying
the
leaden
roof
at
each
step
with
my
foot
before
I
risked
resting
my
weight
on
it
.
<EOS>
I
passed
the
dark
windows
of
Laura
's
room
(
"
God
bless
her
and
keep
her
to
-
night
!
"
)
.
<EOS>
I
passed
the
dark
window
of
Sir
Percival
's
room
.
<EOS>
Then
I
waited
a
moment
,
knelt
down
with
my
hands
to
support
me
,
and
so
crept
to
my
position
,
under
the
protection
of
the
low
wall
between
the
bottom
of
the
lighted
window
and
the
verandah
roof
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
ventured
to
look
up
at
the
window
itself
I
found
that
the
top
of
it
only
was
open
,
and
that
the
blind
inside
was
drawn
down
.
<EOS>
While
I
was
looking
I
saw
the
shadow
of
Madame
Fosco
pass
across
the
white
field
of
the
blind
 
then
pass
slowly
back
again
.
<EOS>
Thus
far
she
could
not
have
heard
me
,
or
the
shadow
would
surely
have
stopped
at
the
blind
,
even
if
she
had
wanted
courage
enough
to
open
the
window
and
look
out
?
  
<EOS>
I
placed
myself
sideways
against
the
railing
of
the
verandah
 
first
ascertaining
,
by
touching
them
,
the
position
of
the
flower
-
pots
on
either
side
of
me
.
<EOS>
There
was
room
enough
for
me
to
sit
between
them
and
no
more
.
<EOS>
The
sweet
-
scented
leaves
of
the
flower
on
my
left
hand
just
brushed
my
cheek
as
I
lightly
rested
my
head
against
the
railing
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
sounds
that
reached
me
from
below
were
caused
by
the
opening
or
closing
(
most
probably
the
latter
)
of
three
doors
in
succession
 
the
doors
,
no
doubt
,
leading
into
the
hall
and
into
the
rooms
on
each
side
of
the
library
,
which
the
Count
had
pledged
himself
to
examine
.
<EOS>
The
first
object
that
I
saw
was
the
red
spark
again
travelling
out
into
the
night
from
under
the
verandah
,
moving
away
towards
my
window
,
waiting
a
moment
,
and
then
returning
to
the
place
from
which
it
had
set
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
devil
take
your
restlessness
!
<EOS>
When
do
you
mean
to
sit
down
?
<EOS>
"
growled
Sir
Percival
's
voice
beneath
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ouf
!
<EOS>
how
hot
it
is
!
"
said
the
Count
,
sighing
and
puffing
wearily
.
  
<EOS>
His
exclamation
was
followed
by
the
scraping
of
the
garden
chairs
on
the
tiled
pavement
under
the
verandah
 
the
welcome
sound
which
told
me
they
were
going
to
sit
close
at
the
window
as
usual
.
<EOS>
So
far
the
chance
was
mine
.
<EOS>
The
clock
in
the
turret
struck
the
quarter
to
twelve
as
they
settled
themselves
in
their
chairs
.
<EOS>
I
heard
Madame
Fosco
through
the
open
window
yawning
,
and
saw
her
shadow
pass
once
more
across
the
white
field
of
the
blind
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
began
talking
together
below
,
now
and
then
dropping
their
voices
a
little
lower
than
usual
,
but
never
sinking
them
to
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
The
strangeness
and
peril
of
my
situation
,
the
dread
,
which
I
could
not
master
,
of
Madame
Fosco
's
lighted
window
,
made
it
difficult
,
almost
impossible
,
for
me
,
at
first
,
to
keep
my
presence
of
mind
,
and
to
fix
my
attention
solely
on
the
conversation
beneath
.
<EOS>
For
some
minutes
I
could
only
succeed
in
gathering
the
general
substance
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
understood
the
Count
to
say
that
the
one
window
alight
was
his
wife
's
,
that
the
ground
floor
of
the
house
was
quite
clear
,
and
that
they
might
now
speak
to
each
other
without
fear
of
accidents
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
merely
answered
by
upbraiding
his
friend
with
having
unjustifiably
slighted
his
wishes
and
neglected
his
interests
all
through
the
day
.
<EOS>
The
Count
thereupon
defended
himself
by
declaring
that
he
had
been
beset
by
certain
troubles
and
anxieties
which
had
absorbed
all
his
attention
,
and
that
the
only
safe
time
to
come
to
an
explanation
was
a
time
when
they
could
feel
certain
of
being
neither
interrupted
nor
overheard
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
at
a
serious
crisis
in
our
affairs
,
Percival
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
if
we
are
to
decide
on
the
future
at
all
,
we
must
decide
secretly
to
-
night
.
"
  
<EOS>
That
sentence
of
the
Count
's
was
the
first
which
my
attention
was
ready
enough
to
master
exactly
as
it
was
spoken
.
<EOS>
From
this
point
,
with
certain
breaks
and
interruptions
,
my
whole
interest
fixed
breathlessly
on
the
conversation
,
and
I
followed
it
word
for
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
Crisis
?
<EOS>
"
repeated
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
worse
crisis
than
you
think
for
,
I
can
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
should
suppose
,
from
your
behaviour
for
the
last
day
or
two
,
"
returned
the
other
coolly
.
"
<EOS>
But
wait
a
little
.
<EOS>
Before
we
advance
to
what
I
do
NOT
know
,
let
us
be
quite
certain
of
what
I
DO
know
.
<EOS>
Let
us
first
see
if
I
am
right
about
the
time
that
is
past
,
before
I
make
any
proposal
to
you
for
the
time
that
is
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
till
I
get
the
brandy
and
water
.
<EOS>
Have
some
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Percival
.
<EOS>
The
cold
water
with
pleasure
,
a
spoon
,
and
the
basin
of
sugar
.
<EOS>
Eau
sucree
,
my
friend
 
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Sugar
-
and
-
water
for
a
man
of
your
age
!
 
<EOS>
There
!
mix
your
sickly
mess
.
<EOS>
You
foreigners
are
all
alike
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Now
listen
,
Percival
.
<EOS>
I
will
put
our
position
plainly
before
you
,
as
I
understand
it
,
and
you
shall
say
if
I
am
right
or
wrong
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
both
came
back
to
this
house
from
the
Continent
with
our
affairs
very
seriously
embarrassed
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Cut
it
short
!
<EOS>
I
wanted
some
thousands
and
you
some
hundreds
,
and
without
the
money
we
were
both
in
a
fair
way
to
go
to
the
dogs
together
.
<EOS>
There
's
the
situation
.
<EOS>
Make
what
you
can
of
it
.
<EOS>
Go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Percival
,
in
your
own
solid
English
words
,
you
wanted
some
thousands
<EOS>
and
I
wanted
some
hundreds
,
and
the
only
way
of
getting
them
was
for
you
to
raise
the
money
for
your
own
necessity
(
with
a
small
margin
beyond
for
my
poor
little
hundreds
)
by
the
help
of
your
wife
.
<EOS>
What
did
I
tell
you
about
your
wife
on
our
way
to
England
?
 
<EOS>
and
what
did
I
tell
you
again
when
we
had
come
here
,
and
when
I
had
seen
for
myself
the
sort
of
woman
Miss
Halcombe
was
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
should
I
know
?
<EOS>
You
talked
nineteen
to
the
dozen
,
I
suppose
,
just
as
usual
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
said
this
:
Human
ingenuity
,
my
friend
<EOS>
,
has
hitherto
only
discovered
two
ways
in
which
a
man
can
manage
a
woman
.
<EOS>
One
way
is
to
knock
her
down
 
a
method
largely
adopted
by
the
brutal
lower
orders
of
the
people
,
but
utterly
abhorrent
to
the
refined
and
educated
classes
above
them
.
<EOS>
The
other
way
(
much
longer
,
much
more
difficult
,
but
in
the
end
not
less
certain
)
is
never
to
accept
a
provocation
at
a
woman
's
hands
.
<EOS>
It
holds
with
animals
,
it
holds
with
children
,
and
it
holds
with
women
,
who
are
nothing
but
children
grown
up
.
<EOS>
Quiet
resolution
is
the
one
quality
the
animals
,
the
children
,
and
the
women
all
fail
in
.
<EOS>
If
they
can
once
shake
this
superior
quality
in
their
master
,
they
get
the
better
of
HIM
.
<EOS>
If
they
can
never
succeed
in
disturbing
it
,
he
gets
the
better
of
THEM
.
<EOS>
I
said
to
you
,
Remember
that
plain
truth
when
you
want
your
wife
to
help
you
to
the
money
.
<EOS>
I
said
,
Remember
it
doubly
and
trebly
in
the
presence
of
your
wife
's
sister
,
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
Have
you
remembered
it
?
<EOS>
Not
once
in
all
the
implications
that
have
twisted
themselves
about
us
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
Every
provocation
that
your
wife
and
her
sister
could
offer
to
you
,
you
instantly
accepted
from
them
.
<EOS>
Your
mad
temper
lost
the
signature
to
the
deed
,
lost
the
ready
money
,
set
Miss
Halcombe
writing
to
the
lawyer
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
First
time
!
<EOS>
Has
she
written
again
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
she
has
written
again
to
-
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
chair
fell
on
the
pavement
of
the
verandah
 
fell
with
a
crash
,
as
if
it
had
been
kicked
down
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
well
for
me
that
the
Count
's
revelation
roused
Sir
Percival
's
anger
as
it
did
.
<EOS>
On
hearing
that
I
had
been
once
more
discovered
I
started
so
that
the
railing
against
which
I
leaned
cracked
again
.
<EOS>
Had
he
followed
me
to
the
inn
?
<EOS>
Did
he
infer
that
I
must
have
given
my
letters
to
Fanny
when
I
told
him
I
had
none
for
the
post
-
bag
.
<EOS>
Even
if
it
was
so
,
how
could
he
have
examined
the
letters
when
they
had
gone
straight
from
my
hand
to
the
bosom
of
the
girl
's
dress
?
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
your
lucky
star
,
"
I
heard
the
Count
say
next
,
"
that
you
have
me
in
the
house
to
undo
the
harm
as
fast
as
you
do
it
.
<EOS>
Thank
your
lucky
star
that
I
said
<EOS>
No
when
you
were
mad
enough
to
talk
of
turning
the
key
to
-
day
on
Miss
Halcombe
,
as
you
turned
it
in
your
mischievous
folly
on
your
wife
.
<EOS>
Where
are
your
eyes
?
<EOS>
Can
you
look
at
Miss
Halcombe
and
not
see
that
she
has
the
foresight
and
the
resolution
of
a
man
?
<EOS>
With
that
woman
for
my
friend
<EOS>
I
would
snap
these
fingers
of
mine
at
the
world
.
<EOS>
With
that
woman
for
my
enemy
,
I
,
with
all
my
brains
and
experience
 
I
,
Fosco
,
cunning
as
the
devil
himself
,
as
you
have
told
me
a
hundred
times
 
I
walk
,
in
your
English
phrase
,
upon
egg
-
shells
!
<EOS>
And
this
grand
creature
 
I
drink
her
health
in
my
sugar
-
and
-
water
 
this
grand
creature
,
who
stands
in
the
strength
of
her
love
and
her
courage
,
firm
as
a
rock
,
between
us
two
and
that
poor
,
flimsy
,
pretty
blonde
wife
of
yours
 
<EOS>
this
magnificent
woman
,
whom
I
admire
with
all
my
soul
,
though
I
oppose
her
in
your
interests
and
in
mine
,
you
drive
to
extremities
as
if
she
was
no
sharper
and
no
bolder
than
the
rest
of
her
sex
.
<EOS>
Percival
!
<EOS>
Percival
!
<EOS>
you
deserve
to
fail
,
and
you
HAVE
failed
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
pause
.
<EOS>
I
write
the
villain
's
words
about
myself
because
I
mean
to
remember
them
 
because
I
hope
yet
for
the
day
when
I
may
speak
out
once
for
all
in
his
presence
,
and
cast
them
back
one
by
one
in
his
teeth
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
bully
and
bluster
as
much
as
you
like
,
"
he
said
sulkily
;
"
the
difficulty
about
the
money
is
not
the
only
difficulty
.
<EOS>
You
would
be
for
taking
strong
measures
with
the
women
yourself
 
if
you
knew
as
much
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
come
to
that
second
difficulty
all
in
good
time
,
"
rejoined
the
Count
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
confuse
yourself
,
Percival
,
as
much
as
you
please
,
but
you
shall
not
confuse
me
.
<EOS>
Let
the
question
of
the
money
be
settled
first
.
<EOS>
Have
I
convinced
your
obstinacy
?
<EOS>
have
I
shown
you
that
your
temper
will
not
let
you
help
yourself
?
 
<EOS>
Or
must
I
go
back
,
and
<EOS>
(
as
you
put
it
in
your
dear
straightforward
English
)
bully
and
bluster
a
little
more
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pooh
!
<EOS>
It
's
easy
enough
to
grumble
at
ME
.
<EOS>
Say
what
is
to
be
done
 
<EOS>
that
's
a
little
harder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
?
<EOS>
Bah
!
<EOS>
This
is
what
is
to
be
done
:
You
give
up
all
direction
in
the
business
from
to
-
night
 
you
leave
it
for
the
future
in
my
hands
only
.
<EOS>
I
am
talking
to
a
Practical
British
man
 
<EOS>
ha
?
<EOS>
Well
,
Practical
,
will
that
do
for
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
propose
if
I
leave
it
all
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Answer
me
first
.
<EOS>
Is
it
to
be
in
my
hands
or
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
it
is
in
your
hands
 
<EOS>
what
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
A
few
questions
,
Percival
,
to
begin
with
.
<EOS>
I
must
wait
a
little
yet
,
to
let
circumstances
guide
me
,
and
I
must
know
,
in
every
possible
way
,
what
those
circumstances
are
likely
to
be
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
time
to
lose
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
already
that
Miss
Halcombe
has
written
to
the
lawyer
to
-
day
for
the
second
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
did
you
find
it
out
?
<EOS>
What
did
she
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
If
I
told
you
,
Percival
,
we
should
only
come
back
at
the
end
to
where
we
are
now
.
<EOS>
Enough
that
I
have
found
it
out
 
and
the
finding
has
caused
that
trouble
and
anxiety
which
made
me
so
inaccessible
to
you
all
through
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Now
,
to
refresh
my
memory
about
your
affairs
 
<EOS>
it
is
some
time
since
I
talked
them
over
with
you
.
<EOS>
The
money
has
been
raised
,
in
the
absence
of
your
wife
's
signature
,
by
means
of
bills
at
three
months
 
raised
at
a
cost
that
makes
my
poverty
-
stricken
foreign
hair
stand
on
end
to
think
of
it
!
<EOS>
When
the
bills
are
due
,
is
there
really
and
truly
no
earthly
way
of
paying
them
but
by
the
help
of
your
wife
?
"
  
"
None
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
You
have
no
money
at
the
bankers
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
few
hundreds
,
when
I
want
as
many
thousands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
no
other
security
to
borrow
upon
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
shred
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
actually
got
with
your
wife
at
the
present
moment
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
but
the
interest
of
her
twenty
thousand
pounds
 
barely
enough
to
pay
our
daily
expenses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
expect
from
your
wife
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Three
thousand
a
year
when
her
uncle
dies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
fine
fortune
,
Percival
.
<EOS>
What
sort
of
a
man
is
this
uncle
?
<EOS>
Old
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
 
neither
old
nor
young
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
good
-
tempered
,
freely
-
living
man
?
<EOS>
Married
?
<EOS>
No
 
I
think
my
wife
told
me
,
not
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
not
.
<EOS>
If
he
was
married
,
and
had
a
son
,
Lady
Glyde
would
not
be
next
heir
to
the
property
.
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
what
he
is
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
maudlin
,
twaddling
,
selfish
fool
,
and
bores
everybody
who
comes
near
him
about
the
state
of
his
health
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Men
of
that
sort
,
Percival
,
live
long
,
and
marry
malevolently
when
you
least
expect
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
give
you
much
,
my
friend
,
for
your
chance
of
the
three
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
Is
there
nothing
more
that
comes
to
you
from
your
wife
?
"
  
"
Nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Absolutely
nothing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Absolutely
nothing
 
except
in
case
of
her
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
in
the
case
of
her
death
.
"
  
There
was
another
pause
.
<EOS>
The
Count
moved
from
the
verandah
to
the
gravel
walk
outside
.
<EOS>
I
knew
that
he
had
moved
by
his
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
rain
has
come
at
last
,
"
I
heard
him
say
.
<EOS>
It
had
come
.
<EOS>
The
state
of
my
cloak
showed
that
it
had
been
falling
thickly
for
some
little
time
.
  
<EOS>
The
Count
went
back
under
the
verandah
 
<EOS>
I
heard
the
chair
creak
beneath
his
weight
as
he
sat
down
in
it
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Percival
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
in
the
case
of
Lady
Glyde
's
death
,
what
do
you
get
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
she
leaves
no
children
 
"
  
"
Which
she
is
likely
to
do
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Which
she
is
not
in
the
least
likely
to
do
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
I
get
her
twenty
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Paid
down
?
"
  
"
Paid
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
silent
once
more
.
<EOS>
As
their
voices
ceased
Madame
Fosco
's
shadow
darkened
the
blind
again
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
passing
this
time
,
it
remained
,
for
a
moment
,
quite
still
.
<EOS>
I
saw
her
fingers
steal
round
the
corner
of
the
blind
,
and
draw
it
on
one
side
.
<EOS>
The
dim
white
outline
of
her
face
,
looking
out
straight
over
me
,
appeared
behind
the
window
.
<EOS>
I
kept
still
,
shrouded
from
head
to
foot
in
my
black
cloak
.
<EOS>
The
rain
,
which
was
fast
wetting
me
,
dripped
over
the
glass
,
blurred
it
,
and
prevented
her
from
seeing
anything
.
"
<EOS>
More
rain
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
heard
her
say
to
herself
.
<EOS>
She
dropped
the
blind
,
and
I
breathed
again
freely
.
  
<EOS>
The
talk
went
on
below
me
,
the
Count
resuming
it
this
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
Percival
!
<EOS>
do
you
care
about
your
wife
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Fosco
!
<EOS>
that
's
rather
a
downright
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
downright
man
,
and
I
repeat
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
the
devil
do
you
look
at
me
in
that
way
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
answer
me
?
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
let
us
say
your
wife
dies
before
the
summer
is
out
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Drop
it
,
Fosco
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
say
your
wife
dies
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Drop
it
,
I
tell
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
,
you
would
gain
twenty
thousand
pounds
,
and
you
would
lose
 
"
  
"
I
should
lose
the
chance
of
three
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
REMOTE
chance
,
Percival
 
<EOS>
the
remote
chance
only
.
<EOS>
And
you
want
money
,
at
once
.
<EOS>
In
your
position
the
gain
is
certain
 
the
loss
doubtful
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Speak
for
yourself
as
well
as
for
me
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
money
I
want
has
been
borrowed
for
you
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
come
to
gain
,
my
wife
's
death
would
be
ten
thousand
pounds
in
your
wife
's
pocket
.
<EOS>
Sharp
as
you
are
,
you
seem
to
have
conveniently
forgotten
Madame
Fosco
's
legacy
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
look
at
me
in
that
way
!
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
have
it
!
<EOS>
What
with
your
looks
and
your
questions
,
upon
my
soul
,
you
make
my
flesh
creep
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
flesh
?
<EOS>
Does
flesh
mean
conscience
in
English
?
<EOS>
I
speak
of
your
wife
's
death
as
I
speak
of
a
possibility
.
<EOS>
Why
not
?
<EOS>
The
respectable
lawyers
who
scribble
-
scrabble
your
deeds
and
your
wills
look
the
deaths
of
living
people
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
Do
lawyers
make
your
flesh
creep
?
<EOS>
Why
should
I
?
<EOS>
It
is
my
business
to
-
night
to
clear
up
your
position
beyond
the
possibility
of
mistake
,
and
I
have
now
done
it
.
<EOS>
Here
is
your
position
.
<EOS>
If
your
wife
lives
,
you
pay
those
bills
with
her
signature
to
the
parchment
.
<EOS>
If
your
wife
dies
,
you
pay
them
with
her
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
the
light
in
Madame
Fosco
's
room
was
extinguished
,
and
the
whole
second
floor
of
the
house
was
now
sunk
in
darkness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Talk
!
<EOS>
talk
!
"
<EOS>
grumbled
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
"
One
would
think
,
to
hear
you
,
that
my
wife
's
signature
to
the
deed
was
got
already
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
left
the
matter
in
my
hands
,
"
retorted
the
Count
,
"
and
I
have
more
than
two
months
before
me
to
turn
round
in
.
<EOS>
Say
no
more
about
it
,
if
you
please
,
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
When
the
bills
are
due
,
you
will
see
for
yourself
if
my
"
talk
!
<EOS>
talk
!
<EOS>
"
is
worth
something
,
or
if
it
is
not
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
Percival
,
having
done
with
the
money
matters
for
to
-
night
,
I
can
place
my
attention
at
your
disposal
,
if
you
wish
to
consult
me
on
that
second
difficulty
which
has
mixed
itself
up
with
our
little
embarrassments
,
and
which
has
so
altered
you
for
the
worse
,
that
I
hardly
know
you
again
.
<EOS>
Speak
,
my
friend
 
and
pardon
me
if
I
shock
your
fiery
national
tastes
by
mixing
myself
a
second
glass
of
sugar
-
and
-
water
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
well
to
say
speak
,
"
replied
Sir
Percival
,
in
a
far
more
quiet
and
more
polite
tone
than
he
had
yet
adopted
,
"
but
it
's
not
so
easy
to
know
how
to
begin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
help
you
?
"
suggested
the
Count
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
give
this
private
difficulty
of
yours
a
name
?
<EOS>
What
if
I
call
it
 
Anne
Catherick
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Look
here
,
Fosco
,
you
and
I
have
known
each
other
for
a
long
time
,
and
if
you
have
helped
me
out
of
one
or
two
scrapes
before
this
,
I
have
done
the
best
I
could
to
help
you
in
return
,
as
far
as
money
would
go
.
<EOS>
We
have
made
as
many
friendly
sacrifices
,
on
both
sides
,
as
men
could
,
but
we
have
had
our
secrets
from
each
other
,
of
course
 
have
n't
we
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
had
a
secret
from
me
,
Percival
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
skeleton
in
your
cupboard
here
at
Blackwater
Park
that
has
peeped
out
in
these
last
few
days
at
other
people
besides
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
suppose
it
has
.
<EOS>
If
it
does
n't
concern
you
,
you
need
n't
be
curious
about
it
,
need
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
I
look
curious
about
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
So
!
<EOS>
so
!
<EOS>
my
face
speaks
the
truth
,
then
?
<EOS>
What
an
immense
foundation
of
good
there
must
be
in
the
nature
of
a
man
who
arrives
at
my
age
,
and
whose
face
has
not
yet
lost
the
habit
of
speaking
the
truth
!
 
<EOS>
Come
,
Glyde
!
<EOS>
let
us
be
candid
one
with
the
other
.
<EOS>
This
secret
of
yours
has
sought
me
:
I
have
not
sought
it
.
<EOS>
Let
us
say
I
am
curious
 
<EOS>
do
you
ask
me
,
as
your
old
friend
,
to
respect
your
secret
,
and
to
leave
it
,
once
for
all
,
in
your
own
keeping
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
that
's
just
what
I
do
ask
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
my
curiosity
is
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
It
dies
in
me
from
this
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
really
mean
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
makes
you
doubt
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
some
experience
,
Fosco
,
of
your
roundabout
ways
,
and
I
am
not
so
sure
that
you
wo
n't
worm
it
out
of
me
after
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
chair
below
suddenly
creaked
again
 
<EOS>
I
felt
the
trellis
-
work
pillar
under
me
shake
from
top
to
bottom
.
<EOS>
The
Count
had
started
to
his
feet
,
and
had
struck
it
with
his
hand
in
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Percival
!
<EOS>
Percival
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
passionately
,
"
do
you
know
me
no
better
than
that
?
<EOS>
Has
all
your
experience
shown
you
nothing
of
my
character
yet
?
<EOS>
I
am
a
man
of
the
antique
type
!
<EOS>
I
am
capable
of
the
most
exalted
acts
of
virtue
 
when
I
have
the
chance
of
performing
them
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
the
misfortune
of
my
life
that
I
have
had
few
chances
.
<EOS>
My
conception
of
friendship
is
sublime
!
<EOS>
Is
it
my
fault
that
your
skeleton
has
peeped
out
at
me
?
<EOS>
Why
do
I
confess
my
curiosity
?
<EOS>
You
poor
superficial
Englishman
,
it
is
to
magnify
my
own
self
-
control
.
<EOS>
I
could
draw
your
secret
out
of
you
,
if
I
liked
,
as
I
draw
this
finger
out
of
the
palm
of
my
hand
 
<EOS>
you
know
I
could
!
<EOS>
But
you
have
appealed
to
my
friendship
,
and
the
duties
of
friendship
are
sacred
to
me
.
<EOS>
See
!
<EOS>
I
trample
my
base
curiosity
under
my
feet
.
<EOS>
My
exalted
sentiments
lift
me
above
it
.
<EOS>
Recognise
them
,
Percival
!
<EOS>
imitate
them
,
Percival
!
<EOS>
Shake
hands
 
<EOS>
I
forgive
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
voice
faltered
over
the
last
words
 
faltered
,
as
if
he
were
actually
shedding
tears
!
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
confusedly
attempted
to
excuse
himself
,
but
the
Count
was
too
magnanimous
to
listen
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
When
my
friend
has
wounded
me
,
I
can
pardon
him
without
apologies
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
in
plain
words
,
do
you
want
my
help
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
badly
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
can
ask
for
it
without
compromising
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
try
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Try
,
then
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
this
is
how
it
stands
:
 
I
told
you
to
-
day
that
I
had
done
my
best
to
find
Anne
Catherick
,
and
failed
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fosco
!
<EOS>
I
'm
a
lost
man
if
I
DON'T
find
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ha
!
Is
it
so
serious
as
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
A
little
stream
of
light
travelled
out
under
the
verandah
,
and
fell
over
the
gravel
-
walk
.
<EOS>
The
Count
had
taken
the
lamp
from
the
inner
part
of
the
room
to
see
his
friend
clearly
by
the
light
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Your
face
speaks
the
truth
this
time
.
<EOS>
Serious
,
indeed
 
as
serious
as
the
money
matters
themselves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
More
serious
.
<EOS>
As
true
as
I
sit
here
,
more
serious
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
light
disappeared
again
and
the
talk
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
showed
you
the
letter
to
my
wife
that
Anne
Catherick
hid
in
the
sand
,
"
Sir
Percival
continued
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
boasting
in
that
letter
,
Fosco
 
she
DOES
know
the
Secret
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
as
little
as
possible
,
Percival
,
in
my
presence
,
of
the
Secret
.
<EOS>
Does
she
know
it
from
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
from
her
mother
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Two
women
in
possession
of
your
private
mind
 
<EOS>
bad
,
bad
,
bad
,
my
friend
!
<EOS>
One
question
here
,
before
we
go
any
farther
.
<EOS>
The
motive
of
your
shutting
up
the
daughter
in
the
asylum
is
now
plain
enough
to
me
,
but
the
manner
of
her
escape
is
not
quite
so
clear
.
<EOS>
Do
you
suspect
the
people
in
charge
of
her
of
closing
their
eyes
purposely
,
at
the
instance
of
some
enemy
who
could
afford
to
make
it
worth
their
while
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
she
was
the
best
-
behaved
patient
they
had
 
and
,
like
fools
,
they
trusted
her
.
<EOS>
She
's
just
mad
enough
to
be
shut
up
,
and
just
sane
enough
to
ruin
me
when
she
's
at
large
 
if
you
understand
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
understand
it
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Percival
,
come
at
once
to
the
point
,
and
then
I
shall
know
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
Where
is
the
danger
of
your
position
at
the
present
moment
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Anne
Catherick
is
in
this
neighbourhood
,
and
in
communication
with
Lady
Glyde
 
<EOS>
there
's
the
danger
,
plain
enough
.
<EOS>
Who
can
read
the
letter
she
hid
in
the
sand
,
and
not
see
that
my
wife
is
in
possession
of
the
Secret
,
deny
it
as
she
may
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
moment
,
Percival
.
<EOS>
If
Lady
Glyde
does
know
the
Secret
,
she
must
know
also
that
it
is
a
compromising
secret
for
you
.
<EOS>
As
your
wife
,
surely
it
is
her
interest
to
keep
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
?
<EOS>
I
'm
coming
to
that
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
her
interest
if
she
cared
two
straws
about
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
happen
to
be
an
encumbrance
in
the
way
of
another
man
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
love
with
him
before
she
married
me
 
<EOS>
she
's
in
love
with
him
now
 
an
infernal
vagabond
of
a
drawing
-
master
,
named
Hartright
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
!
<EOS>
what
is
there
extraordinary
in
that
?
<EOS>
They
are
all
in
love
with
some
other
man
.
<EOS>
Who
gets
the
first
of
a
woman
's
heart
?
<EOS>
In
all
my
experience
I
have
never
yet
met
with
the
man
who
was
Number
One
.
<EOS>
Number
Two
,
sometimes
.
<EOS>
Number
Three
,
Four
,
Five
,
often
.
<EOS>
Number
One
,
never
!
<EOS>
He
exists
,
of
course
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
not
met
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wait
!
<EOS>
I
have
n't
done
yet
.
<EOS>
Who
do
you
think
helped
Anne
Catherick
to
get
the
start
,
when
the
people
from
the
mad
-
house
were
after
her
?
<EOS>
Hartright
.
<EOS>
Who
do
you
think
saw
her
again
in
Cumberland
?
<EOS>
Hartright
.
<EOS>
Both
times
he
spoke
to
her
alone
.
<EOS>
Stop
!
<EOS>
do
n't
interrupt
me
.
<EOS>
The
scoundrel
's
as
sweet
on
my
wife
as
she
is
on
him
.
<EOS>
He
knows
the
Secret
,
and
she
knows
the
Secret
.
<EOS>
Once
let
them
both
get
together
again
,
and
it
's
her
interest
and
his
interest
to
turn
their
information
against
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Gently
,
Percival
 
gently
!
<EOS>
Are
you
insensible
to
the
virtue
of
Lady
Glyde
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
That
for
the
virtue
of
Lady
Glyde
!
<EOS>
I
believe
in
nothing
about
her
but
her
money
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
how
the
case
stands
?
<EOS>
She
might
be
harmless
enough
by
herself
;
but
if
she
and
that
vagabond
Hartright
 
"
  
"
Yes
,
yes
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
Where
is
Mr.
Hartright
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Out
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
If
he
means
to
keep
a
whole
skin
on
his
bones
,
I
recommend
him
not
to
come
back
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
he
is
out
of
the
country
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certain
.
<EOS>
I
had
him
watched
from
the
time
he
left
Cumberland
to
the
time
he
sailed
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
've
been
careful
,
I
can
tell
you
!
<EOS>
Anne
Catherick
lived
with
some
people
at
a
farmhouse
near
Limmeridge
.
<EOS>
I
went
there
myself
,
after
she
had
given
me
the
slip
,
and
made
sure
that
they
knew
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
gave
her
mother
a
form
of
letter
to
write
to
Miss
Halcombe
,
exonerating
me
from
any
bad
motive
in
putting
her
under
restraint
.
<EOS>
I
've
spent
,
I
'm
afraid
to
say
how
much
,
in
trying
to
trace
her
,
and
in
spite
of
it
all
,
she
turns
up
here
and
escapes
me
on
my
own
property
!
<EOS>
How
do
I
know
who
else
may
see
her
,
who
else
may
speak
to
her
?
<EOS>
That
prying
scoundrel
,
Hartright
,
may
come
back
without
my
knowing
it
,
and
may
make
use
of
her
to
-
morrow
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
he
,
Percival
!
<EOS>
While
I
am
on
the
spot
,
and
while
that
woman
is
in
the
neighbourhood
,
I
will
answer
for
our
laying
hands
on
her
before
Mr.
Hartright
 
even
if
he
does
come
back
.
<EOS>
I
see
!
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
I
see
!
<EOS>
The
finding
of
Anne
Catherick
is
the
first
necessity
 
make
your
mind
easy
about
the
rest
.
<EOS>
Your
wife
is
here
,
under
your
thumb
 
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
is
inseparable
from
her
,
and
is
,
therefore
,
under
your
thumb
also
 
and
Mr.
Hartright
is
out
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
This
invisible
Anne
of
yours
is
all
we
have
to
think
of
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
You
have
made
your
inquiries
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
to
her
mother
,
I
have
ransacked
the
village
 
and
all
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
her
mother
to
be
depended
on
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
told
your
secret
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
wo
n't
tell
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
<EOS>
Are
her
own
interests
concerned
in
keeping
it
,
as
well
as
yours
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
 
deeply
concerned
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
Percival
,
for
your
sake
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
discouraged
,
my
friend
.
<EOS>
Our
money
matters
,
as
I
told
you
,
leave
me
plenty
of
time
to
turn
round
in
,
and
I
may
search
for
Anne
Catherick
to
-
morrow
to
better
purpose
than
you
.
<EOS>
One
last
question
before
we
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
this
.
<EOS>
When
I
went
to
the
boat
-
house
to
tell
Lady
Glyde
that
the
little
difficulty
of
her
signature
was
put
off
,
accident
took
me
there
in
time
to
see
a
strange
woman
parting
in
a
very
suspicious
manner
from
your
wife
.
<EOS>
But
accident
did
not
bring
me
near
enough
to
see
this
same
woman
's
face
plainly
.
<EOS>
I
must
know
how
to
recognise
our
invisible
Anne
.
<EOS>
What
is
she
like
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Like
?
<EOS>
Come
!
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
in
two
words
.
<EOS>
She
's
a
sickly
likeness
of
my
wife
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
chair
creaked
,
and
the
pillar
shook
once
more
.
<EOS>
The
Count
was
on
his
feet
again
 
this
time
in
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
!
!
<EOS>
"
he
exclaimed
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fancy
my
wife
,
after
a
bad
illness
,
with
a
touch
of
something
wrong
in
her
head
 
and
there
is
Anne
Catherick
for
you
,
"
answered
Sir
Percival
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
they
related
to
each
other
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
yet
so
like
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
so
like
.
<EOS>
What
are
you
laughing
about
?
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
answer
,
and
no
sound
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
The
Count
was
laughing
in
his
smooth
silent
internal
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
laughing
about
?
"
reiterated
Sir
Percival
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
at
my
own
fancies
,
my
good
friend
.
<EOS>
Allow
me
my
Italian
humour
 
<EOS>
do
I
not
come
of
the
illustrious
nation
which
invented
the
exhibition
of
Punch
?
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
well
,
I
shall
know
Anne
Catherick
when
I
see
her
 
and
so
enough
for
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Make
your
mind
easy
,
Percival
.
<EOS>
Sleep
,
my
son
,
the
sleep
of
the
just
,
and
see
what
I
will
do
for
you
when
daylight
comes
to
help
us
both
.
<EOS>
I
have
my
projects
and
my
plans
here
in
my
big
head
.
<EOS>
You
shall
pay
those
bills
and
find
Anne
Catherick
 
my
sacred
word
of
honour
on
it
,
but
you
shall
!
<EOS>
Am
I
a
friend
to
be
treasured
in
the
best
corner
of
your
heart
,
or
am
I
not
?
<EOS>
Am
I
worth
those
loans
of
money
which
you
so
delicately
reminded
me
of
a
little
while
since
?
<EOS>
Whatever
you
do
,
never
wound
me
in
my
sentiments
any
more
.
<EOS>
Recognise
them
,
Percival
!
<EOS>
imitate
them
,
Percival
!
<EOS>
I
forgive
you
again
 
I
shake
hands
again
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Not
another
word
was
spoken
.
<EOS>
I
heard
the
Count
close
the
library
door
.
<EOS>
I
heard
Sir
Percival
barring
up
the
window
-
shutters
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
raining
,
raining
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
I
was
cramped
by
my
position
and
chilled
to
the
bones
.
<EOS>
When
I
first
tried
to
move
,
the
effort
was
so
painful
to
me
that
I
was
obliged
to
desist
.
<EOS>
I
tried
a
second
time
,
and
succeeded
in
rising
to
my
knees
on
the
wet
roof
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
crept
to
the
wall
,
and
raised
myself
against
it
,
I
looked
back
,
and
saw
the
window
of
the
Count
's
dressing
-
room
gleam
into
light
.
<EOS>
My
sinking
courage
flickered
up
in
me
again
,
and
kept
my
eyes
fixed
on
his
window
,
as
I
stole
my
way
back
,
step
by
step
,
past
the
wall
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
The
clock
struck
the
quarter
after
one
,
when
I
laid
my
hands
on
the
window
-
sill
of
my
own
room
.
<EOS>
I
had
seen
nothing
and
heard
nothing
which
could
lead
me
to
suppose
that
my
retreat
had
been
discovered
.
    
<EOS>
June
20th
.
 
<EOS>
Eight
o'clock
.
<EOS>
The
sun
is
shining
in
a
clear
sky
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
been
near
my
bed
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
once
closed
my
weary
wakeful
eyes
.
<EOS>
From
the
same
window
at
which
I
looked
out
into
the
darkness
of
last
night
,
I
look
out
now
at
the
bright
stillness
of
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
I
count
the
hours
that
have
passed
since
I
escaped
to
the
shelter
of
this
room
by
my
own
sensations
 
and
those
hours
seem
like
weeks
.
  
<EOS>
How
short
a
time
,
and
yet
how
long
to
ME
 
since
I
sank
down
in
the
darkness
,
here
,
on
the
floor
 
drenched
to
the
skin
,
cramped
in
every
limb
,
cold
to
the
bones
,
a
useless
,
helpless
,
panic
-
stricken
creature
.
  
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
when
I
roused
myself
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
when
I
groped
my
way
back
to
the
bedroom
,
and
lighted
the
candle
,
and
searched
(
with
a
strange
ignorance
,
at
first
,
of
where
to
look
for
them
)
for
dry
clothes
to
warm
me
.
<EOS>
The
doing
of
these
things
is
in
my
mind
,
but
not
the
time
when
they
were
done
.
  
<EOS>
Can
I
even
remember
when
the
chilled
,
cramped
feeling
left
me
,
and
the
throbbing
heat
came
in
its
place
?
  
<EOS>
Surely
it
was
before
the
sun
rose
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
heard
the
clock
strike
three
.
<EOS>
I
remember
the
time
by
the
sudden
brightness
and
clearness
,
the
feverish
strain
and
excitement
of
all
my
faculties
which
came
with
it
.
<EOS>
I
remember
my
resolution
to
control
myself
,
to
wait
patiently
hour
after
hour
,
till
the
chance
offered
of
removing
Laura
from
this
horrible
place
,
without
the
danger
of
immediate
discovery
and
pursuit
.
<EOS>
I
remember
the
persuasion
settling
itself
in
my
mind
that
the
words
those
two
men
had
said
to
each
other
would
furnish
us
,
not
only
with
our
justification
for
leaving
the
house
,
but
with
our
weapons
of
defence
against
them
as
well
.
<EOS>
I
recall
the
impulse
that
awakened
in
me
to
preserve
those
words
in
writing
,
exactly
as
they
were
spoken
,
while
the
time
was
my
own
,
and
while
my
memory
vividly
retained
them
.
<EOS>
All
this
I
remember
plainly
:
there
is
no
confusion
in
my
head
yet
.
<EOS>
The
coming
in
here
from
the
bedroom
,
with
my
pen
and
ink
and
paper
,
before
sunrise
 
the
sitting
down
at
the
widely
-
opened
window
to
get
all
the
air
I
could
to
cool
me
 
the
ceaseless
writing
,
faster
and
faster
,
hotter
and
hotter
,
driving
on
more
and
more
wakefully
,
all
through
the
dreadful
interval
before
the
house
was
astir
again
 
<EOS>
how
clearly
I
recall
it
,
from
the
beginning
by
candle
-
light
,
to
the
end
on
the
page
before
this
,
in
the
sunshine
of
the
new
day
!
  
<EOS>
Why
do
I
sit
here
still
?
<EOS>
Why
do
I
weary
my
hot
eyes
and
my
burning
head
by
writing
more
?
<EOS>
Why
not
lie
down
and
rest
myself
,
and
try
to
quench
the
fever
that
consumes
me
,
in
sleep
?
  
<EOS>
I
dare
not
attempt
it
.
<EOS>
A
fear
beyond
all
other
fears
has
got
possession
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
of
this
heat
that
parches
my
skin
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
of
the
creeping
and
throbbing
that
I
feel
in
my
head
.
<EOS>
If
I
lie
down
now
,
how
do
I
know
that
I
may
have
the
sense
and
the
strength
to
rise
again
?
  
<EOS>
Oh
,
the
rain
,
the
rain
 
the
cruel
rain
that
chilled
me
last
night
!
  
<EOS>
Nine
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Was
it
nine
struck
,
or
eight
?
<EOS>
Nine
,
surely
?
<EOS>
I
am
shivering
again
 
shivering
,
from
head
to
foot
,
in
the
summer
air
.
<EOS>
Have
I
been
sitting
here
asleep
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
I
have
been
doing
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
God
!
<EOS>
am
I
going
to
be
ill
?
  
<EOS>
Ill
,
at
such
a
time
as
this
!
  
<EOS>
My
head
 
I
am
sadly
afraid
of
my
head

<EOS>
I
can
write
,
but
the
lines
all
run
together
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
words

Laura
 
I
can
write
Laura

and
see
I
write
it

Eight

<EOS>
So
cold

so
cold
 
<EOS>
oh
,
that
rain
last
night
!
 
<EOS>
and
the
strokes
of
the

strokes

striking

POSTSCRIPT
BY
A
SINCERE
FRIEND
  
<EOS>
The
illness
of
our
excellent
Miss
Halcombe
has
afforded
me
the
opportunity
of
enjoying
an
unexpected
intellectual
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
I
refer
to
the
perusal
(
which
I
have
just
completed
)
of
this
interesting
Diary
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
many
hundred
pages
here
.
<EOS>
I
can
lay
my
hand
on
my
heart
,
and
declare
that
every
page
has
charmed
,
refreshed
,
delighted
me
.
  
<EOS>
To
a
man
of
my
sentiments
it
is
unspeakably
gratifying
to
be
able
to
say
this
.
  
<EOS>
Admirable
woman
!
  
<EOS>
I
allude
to
Miss
Halcombe
.
  
<EOS>
Stupendous
effort
!
  
<EOS>
I
refer
to
the
Diary
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
these
pages
are
amazing
.
<EOS>
The
tact
which
I
find
here
,
the
discretion
,
the
rare
courage
,
the
wonderful
power
of
memory
,
the
accurate
observation
of
character
,
the
easy
grace
of
style
,
the
charming
outbursts
of
womanly
feeling
,
have
all
inexpressibly
increased
my
admiration
of
this
sublime
creature
,
of
this
magnificent
Marian
.
<EOS>
The
presentation
of
my
own
character
is
masterly
in
the
extreme
.
<EOS>
I
certify
,
with
my
whole
heart
,
to
the
fidelity
of
the
portrait
.
<EOS>
I
feel
how
vivid
an
impression
I
must
have
produced
to
have
been
painted
in
such
strong
,
such
rich
,
such
massive
colours
as
these
.
<EOS>
I
lament
afresh
the
cruel
necessity
which
sets
our
interests
at
variance
,
and
opposes
us
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
Under
happier
circumstances
how
worthy
I
should
have
been
of
Miss
Halcombe
 
how
worthy
Miss
Halcombe
would
have
been
of
ME
.
  
<EOS>
The
sentiments
which
animate
my
heart
assure
me
that
the
lines
I
have
just
written
express
a
Profound
Truth
.
  
<EOS>
Those
sentiments
exalt
me
above
all
merely
personal
considerations
.
<EOS>
I
bear
witness
,
in
the
most
disinterested
manner
,
to
the
excellence
of
the
stratagem
by
which
this
unparalleled
woman
surprised
the
private
interview
between
Percival
and
myself
 
also
to
the
marvellous
accuracy
of
her
report
of
the
whole
conversation
from
its
beginning
to
its
end
.
  
<EOS>
Those
sentiments
have
induced
me
to
offer
to
the
unimpressionable
doctor
who
attends
on
her
my
vast
knowledge
of
chemistry
,
and
my
luminous
experience
of
the
more
subtle
resources
which
medical
and
magnetic
science
have
placed
at
the
disposal
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
He
has
hitherto
declined
to
avail
himself
of
my
assistance
.
<EOS>
Miserable
man
!
  
<EOS>
Finally
,
those
sentiments
dictate
the
lines
 
grateful
,
sympathetic
,
paternal
lines
 
which
appear
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
I
close
the
book
.
<EOS>
My
strict
sense
of
propriety
restores
it
(
by
the
hands
of
my
wife
)
to
its
place
on
the
writer
's
table
.
<EOS>
Events
are
hurrying
me
away
.
<EOS>
Circumstances
are
guiding
me
to
serious
issues
.
<EOS>
Vast
perspectives
of
success
unroll
themselves
before
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
accomplish
my
destiny
with
a
calmness
which
is
terrible
to
myself
.
<EOS>
Nothing
but
the
homage
of
my
admiration
is
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
deposit
it
with
respectful
tenderness
at
the
feet
of
Miss
Halcombe
.
  
<EOS>
I
breathe
my
wishes
for
her
recovery
.
  
<EOS>
I
condole
with
her
on
the
inevitable
failure
of
every
plan
that
she
has
formed
for
her
sister
's
benefit
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
I
entreat
her
to
believe
that
the
information
which
I
have
derived
from
her
Diary
will
in
no
respect
help
me
to
contribute
to
that
failure
.
<EOS>
It
simply
confirms
the
plan
of
conduct
which
I
had
previously
arranged
.
<EOS>
I
have
to
thank
these
pages
for
awakening
the
finest
sensibilities
in
my
nature
 
nothing
more
.
  
<EOS>
To
a
person
of
similar
sensibility
this
simple
assertion
will
explain
and
excuse
everything
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
is
a
person
of
similar
sensibility
.
  
<EOS>
In
that
persuasion
I
sign
myself
,
Fosco
.

Narratives
that
are
shortly
to
follow
it
,
were
originally
obtained
,
forms
the
subject
of
an
explanation
which
will
appear
at
a
later
period
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
the
grand
misfortune
of
my
life
that
nobody
will
let
me
alone
.
  
<EOS>
Why
 
I
ask
everybody
 
why
worry
ME
?
<EOS>
Nobody
answers
that
question
,
and
nobody
lets
me
alone
.
<EOS>
Relatives
,
friends
,
and
strangers
all
combine
to
annoy
me
.
<EOS>
What
have
I
done
?
<EOS>
I
ask
myself
,
I
ask
my
servant
,
Louis
,
fifty
times
a
day
 
what
have
I
done
?
<EOS>
Neither
of
us
can
tell
.
<EOS>
Most
extraordinary
!
  
<EOS>
The
last
annoyance
that
has
assailed
me
is
the
annoyance
of
being
called
upon
to
write
this
Narrative
.
<EOS>
Is
a
man
in
my
state
of
nervous
wretchedness
capable
of
writing
narratives
?
<EOS>
When
I
put
this
extremely
reasonable
objection
,
I
am
told
that
certain
very
serious
events
relating
to
my
niece
have
happened
within
my
experience
,
and
that
I
am
the
fit
person
to
describe
them
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
I
am
threatened
if
I
fail
to
exert
myself
in
the
manner
required
,
with
consequences
which
I
can
not
so
much
as
think
of
without
perfect
prostration
.
<EOS>
There
is
really
no
need
to
threaten
me
.
<EOS>
Shattered
by
my
miserable
health
and
my
family
troubles
,
I
am
incapable
of
resistance
.
<EOS>
If
you
insist
,
you
take
your
unjust
advantage
of
me
,
and
I
give
way
immediately
.
<EOS>
I
will
endeavour
to
remember
what
I
can
(
under
protest
)
,
and
to
write
what
I
can
(
also
under
protest
)
,
and
what
I
ca
n't
remember
and
ca
n't
write
,
Louis
must
remember
and
write
for
me
.
<EOS>
He
is
an
ass
,
and
I
am
an
invalid
,
and
we
are
likely
to
make
all
sorts
of
mistakes
between
us
.
<EOS>
How
humiliating
!
  
<EOS>
I
am
told
to
remember
dates
.
<EOS>
Good
heavens
!
<EOS>
I
never
did
such
a
thing
in
my
life
 
<EOS>
how
am
I
to
begin
now
?
  
<EOS>
I
have
asked
Louis
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
quite
such
an
ass
as
I
have
hitherto
supposed
.
<EOS>
He
remembers
the
date
of
the
event
,
within
a
week
or
two
 
and
I
remember
the
name
of
the
person
.
<EOS>
The
date
was
towards
the
end
of
June
,
or
the
beginning
of
July
,
and
the
name
(
in
my
opinion
a
remarkably
vulgar
one
)
was
Fanny
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
June
,
or
the
beginning
of
July
,
then
,
I
was
reclining
in
my
customary
state
,
surrounded
by
the
various
objects
of
Art
which
I
have
collected
about
me
to
improve
the
taste
of
the
barbarous
people
in
my
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
That
is
to
say
,
I
had
the
photographs
of
my
pictures
,
and
prints
,
and
coins
,
and
so
forth
,
all
about
me
,
which
I
intend
,
one
of
these
days
,
to
present
(
the
photographs
,
I
mean
,
if
the
clumsy
English
language
will
let
me
mean
anything
)
to
present
to
the
institution
at
Carlisle
(
horrid
place
!
)
,
with
a
view
to
improving
the
tastes
of
the
members
(
Goths
and
Vandals
to
a
man
)
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
supposed
that
a
gentleman
who
was
in
course
of
conferring
a
great
national
benefit
on
his
countrymen
was
the
last
gentleman
in
the
world
to
be
unfeelingly
worried
about
private
difficulties
and
family
affairs
.
<EOS>
Quite
a
mistake
,
I
assure
you
,
in
my
case
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
there
I
was
,
reclining
,
with
my
art
-
treasures
about
me
,
and
wanting
a
quiet
morning
.
<EOS>
Because
I
wanted
a
quiet
morning
,
of
course
Louis
came
in
.
<EOS>
It
was
perfectly
natural
that
I
should
inquire
what
the
deuce
he
meant
by
making
his
appearance
when
I
had
not
rung
my
bell
.
<EOS>
I
seldom
swear
 
it
is
such
an
ungentlemanlike
habit
 
<EOS>
but
when
Louis
answered
by
a
grin
,
I
think
it
was
also
perfectly
natural
that
I
should
damn
him
for
grinning
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
I
did
.
  
<EOS>
This
rigorous
mode
of
treatment
,
I
have
observed
,
invariably
brings
persons
in
the
lower
class
of
life
to
their
senses
.
<EOS>
It
brought
Louis
to
HIS
senses
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
obliging
as
to
leave
off
grinning
,
and
inform
me
that
a
Young
Person
was
outside
wanting
to
see
me
.
<EOS>
He
added
(
with
the
odious
talkativeness
of
servants
)
,
that
her
name
was
Fanny
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
Fanny
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Glyde
's
maid
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
Lady
Glyde
's
maid
want
with
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
letter
,
sir
 
"
  
"
Take
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
refuses
to
give
it
to
anybody
<EOS>
but
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
sends
the
letter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Halcombe
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
moment
I
heard
Miss
Halcombe
's
name
I
gave
up
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
habit
of
mine
always
to
give
up
to
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
I
find
,
by
experience
,
that
it
saves
noise
.
<EOS>
I
gave
up
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
Dear
Marian
!
  
<EOS>
"
Let
Lady
Glyde
's
maid
come
in
,
Louis
.
<EOS>
Stop
!
<EOS>
Do
her
shoes
creak
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
ask
the
question
.
<EOS>
Creaking
shoes
invariably
upset
me
for
the
day
.
<EOS>
I
was
resigned
to
see
the
Young
Person
,
but
I
was
NOT
resigned
to
let
the
Young
Person
's
shoes
upset
me
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
limit
even
to
my
endurance
.
  
<EOS>
Louis
affirmed
distinctly
that
her
shoes
were
to
be
depended
upon
.
<EOS>
I
waved
my
hand
.
<EOS>
He
introduced
her
.
<EOS>
Is
it
necessary
to
say
that
she
expressed
her
sense
of
embarrassment
by
shutting
up
her
mouth
and
breathing
through
her
nose
?
<EOS>
To
the
student
of
female
human
nature
in
the
lower
orders
,
surely
not
.
  
<EOS>
Let
me
do
the
girl
justice
.
<EOS>
Her
shoes
did
NOT
creak
.
<EOS>
But
why
do
Young
Persons
in
service
all
perspire
at
the
hands
?
<EOS>
Why
have
they
all
got
fat
noses
and
hard
cheeks
?
<EOS>
And
why
are
their
faces
so
sadly
unfinished
,
especially
about
the
corners
of
the
eyelids
?
<EOS>
I
am
not
strong
enough
to
think
deeply
myself
on
any
subject
,
but
I
appeal
to
professional
men
,
who
are
.
<EOS>
Why
have
we
no
variety
in
our
breed
of
Young
Persons
?
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
letter
for
me
,
from
Miss
Halcombe
?
<EOS>
Put
it
down
on
the
table
,
please
,
and
do
n't
upset
anything
.
<EOS>
How
is
Miss
Halcombe
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
thank
you
,
sir
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
Lady
Glyde
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
received
no
answer
.
<EOS>
The
Young
Person
's
face
became
more
unfinished
than
ever
,
and
I
think
she
began
to
cry
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
saw
something
moist
about
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
Tears
or
perspiration
?
<EOS>
Louis
(
whom
I
have
just
consulted
)
is
inclined
to
think
,
tears
.
<EOS>
He
is
in
her
class
of
life
,
and
he
ought
to
know
best
.
<EOS>
Let
us
say
,
tears
.
  
<EOS>
Except
when
the
refining
process
of
Art
judiciously
removes
from
them
all
resemblance
to
Nature
,
I
distinctly
object
to
tears
.
<EOS>
Tears
are
scientifically
described
as
a
Secretion
.
<EOS>
I
can
understand
that
a
secretion
may
be
healthy
or
unhealthy
,
but
I
can
not
see
the
interest
of
a
secretion
from
a
sentimental
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
my
own
secretions
being
all
wrong
together
,
I
am
a
little
prejudiced
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
No
matter
.
<EOS>
I
behaved
,
on
this
occasion
,
with
all
possible
propriety
and
feeling
.
<EOS>
I
closed
my
eyes
and
said
to
Louis
    
"
Endeavour
to
ascertain
what
she
means
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Louis
endeavoured
,
and
the
Young
Person
endeavoured
.
<EOS>
They
succeeded
in
confusing
each
other
to
such
an
extent
that
I
am
bound
in
common
gratitude
to
say
,
they
really
amused
me
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
shall
send
for
them
again
when
I
am
in
low
spirits
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
mentioned
this
idea
to
Louis
.
<EOS>
Strange
to
say
,
it
seems
to
make
him
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
Poor
devil
!
  
<EOS>
Surely
I
am
not
expected
to
repeat
my
niece
's
maid
's
explanation
of
her
tears
,
interpreted
in
the
English
of
my
Swiss
valet
?
<EOS>
The
thing
is
manifestly
impossible
.
<EOS>
I
can
give
my
own
impressions
and
feelings
perhaps
.
<EOS>
Will
that
do
as
well
?
<EOS>
Please
say
,
Yes
.
  
<EOS>
My
idea
is
that
she
began
by
telling
me
(
through
Louis
)
that
her
master
had
dismissed
her
from
her
mistress
's
service
.
<EOS>
(
Observe
,
throughout
,
the
strange
irrelevancy
of
the
Young
Person
.
<EOS>
Was
it
my
fault
that
she
had
lost
her
place
?
)
<EOS>
On
her
dismissal
,
she
had
gone
to
the
inn
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
(
I
do
n't
keep
the
inn
 
<EOS>
why
mention
it
to
ME
?
)
<EOS>
Between
six
o'clock
and
seven
Miss
Halcombe
had
come
to
say
good
-
bye
,
and
had
given
her
two
letters
,
one
for
me
,
and
one
for
a
gentleman
in
London
.
<EOS>
(
I
am
not
a
gentleman
in
London
 
<EOS>
hang
the
gentleman
in
London
!
)
<EOS>
She
had
carefully
put
the
two
letters
into
her
bosom
(
what
have
I
to
do
with
her
bosom
?
)
;
she
had
been
very
unhappy
,
when
Miss
Halcombe
had
gone
away
again
;
she
had
not
had
the
heart
to
put
bit
or
drop
between
her
lips
till
it
was
near
bedtime
,
and
then
,
when
it
was
close
on
nine
o'clock
,
she
had
thought
she
should
like
a
cup
of
tea
.
<EOS>
(
Am
I
responsible
for
any
of
these
vulgar
fluctuations
,
which
begin
with
unhappiness
and
end
with
tea
?
)
<EOS>
Just
as
she
was
WARMING
THE
POT
<EOS>
(
I
give
the
words
on
the
authority
of
Louis
,
who
says
he
knows
what
they
mean
,
and
wishes
to
explain
,
but
I
snub
him
on
principle
)
 
just
as
she
was
warming
the
pot
the
door
opened
,
and
she
was
STRUCK
OF
A
HEAP
(
her
own
words
again
,
and
perfectly
unintelligible
this
time
to
Louis
,
as
well
as
to
myself
)
by
the
appearance
in
the
inn
parlour
of
her
ladyship
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
I
give
my
niece
's
maid
's
description
of
my
sister
's
title
with
a
sense
of
the
highest
relish
.
<EOS>
My
poor
dear
sister
is
a
tiresome
woman
who
married
a
foreigner
.
<EOS>
To
resume
:
the
door
opened
,
her
ladyship
the
Countess
appeared
in
the
parlour
,
and
the
Young
Person
was
struck
of
a
heap
.
<EOS>
Most
remarkable
!
  
<EOS>
I
must
really
rest
a
little
before
I
can
get
on
any
farther
.
<EOS>
When
I
have
reclined
for
a
few
minutes
,
with
my
eyes
closed
,
and
when
Louis
has
refreshed
my
poor
aching
temples
with
a
little
eau
-
de
-
Cologne
,
I
may
be
able
to
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
the
Countess
    
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
am
able
to
proceed
,
but
not
to
sit
up
.
<EOS>
I
will
recline
and
dictate
.
<EOS>
Louis
has
a
horrid
accent
,
but
he
knows
the
language
,
and
can
write
.
<EOS>
How
very
convenient
!
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
,
the
Countess
,
explained
her
unexpected
appearance
at
the
inn
by
telling
Fanny
that
she
had
come
to
bring
one
or
two
little
messages
which
Miss
Halcombe
in
her
hurry
had
forgotten
.
<EOS>
The
Young
Person
thereupon
waited
anxiously
to
hear
what
the
messages
were
,
but
the
Countess
seemed
disinclined
to
mention
them
(
so
like
my
sister
's
tiresome
way
!
)
<EOS>
until
Fanny
had
had
her
tea
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
was
surprisingly
kind
and
thoughtful
about
it
(
extremely
unlike
my
sister
)
,
and
said
,
"
I
am
sure
,
my
poor
girl
,
you
must
want
your
tea
.
<EOS>
We
can
let
the
messages
wait
till
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
<EOS>
if
nothing
else
will
put
you
at
your
ease
,
I
'll
make
the
tea
and
have
a
cup
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
those
were
the
words
,
as
reported
excitably
,
in
my
presence
,
by
the
Young
Person
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
the
Countess
insisted
on
making
the
tea
,
and
carried
her
ridiculous
ostentation
of
humility
so
far
as
to
take
one
cup
herself
,
and
to
insist
on
the
girl
's
taking
the
other
.
<EOS>
The
girl
drank
the
tea
,
and
according
to
her
own
account
,
solemnised
the
extraordinary
occasion
five
minutes
afterwards
by
fainting
dead
away
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
.
<EOS>
Here
again
I
use
her
own
words
.
<EOS>
Louis
thinks
they
were
accompanied
by
an
increased
secretion
of
tears
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
myself
.
<EOS>
The
effort
of
listening
being
quite
as
much
as
I
could
manage
,
my
eyes
were
closed
.
  
<EOS>
Where
did
I
leave
off
?
<EOS>
Ah
,
yes
 
she
fainted
after
drinking
a
cup
of
tea
with
the
Countess
 
<EOS>
a
proceeding
which
might
have
interested
me
if
I
had
been
her
medical
man
,
but
being
nothing
of
the
sort
<EOS>
I
felt
bored
by
hearing
of
it
,
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
When
she
came
to
herself
in
half
an
hour
's
time
she
was
on
the
sofa
,
and
nobody
was
with
her
but
the
landlady
.
<EOS>
The
Countess
,
finding
it
too
late
to
remain
any
longer
at
the
inn
,
had
gone
away
as
soon
as
the
girl
showed
signs
of
recovering
,
and
the
landlady
had
been
good
enough
to
help
her
upstairs
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
Left
by
herself
,
she
had
felt
in
her
bosom
<EOS>
(
I
regret
the
necessity
of
referring
to
this
part
of
the
subject
a
second
time
)
,
and
had
found
the
two
letters
there
quite
safe
,
but
strangely
crumpled
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
giddy
in
the
night
,
but
had
got
up
well
enough
to
travel
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
She
had
put
the
letter
addressed
to
that
obtrusive
stranger
,
the
gentleman
in
London
into
the
post
,
and
had
now
delivered
the
other
letter
into
my
hands
as
she
was
told
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
plain
truth
,
and
though
she
could
not
blame
herself
for
any
intentional
neglect
,
she
was
sadly
troubled
in
her
mind
,
and
sadly
in
want
of
a
word
of
advice
.
<EOS>
At
this
point
Louis
thinks
the
secretions
appeared
again
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
they
did
,
but
it
is
of
infinitely
greater
importance
to
mention
that
at
this
point
also
I
lost
my
patience
,
opened
my
eyes
,
and
interfered
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
purport
of
all
this
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
My
niece
's
irrelevant
maid
stared
,
and
stood
speechless
.
  
<EOS>
"
Endeavour
to
explain
,
"
I
said
to
my
servant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Translate
me
,
Louis
.
"
  
<EOS>
Louis
endeavoured
and
translated
.
<EOS>
In
other
words
,
he
descended
immediately
into
a
bottomless
pit
of
confusion
,
and
the
Young
Person
followed
him
down
.
<EOS>
I
really
do
n't
know
when
I
have
been
so
amused
.
<EOS>
I
left
them
at
the
bottom
of
the
pit
as
long
as
they
diverted
me
.
<EOS>
When
they
ceased
to
divert
me
,
I
exerted
my
intelligence
,
and
pulled
them
up
again
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
my
interference
enabled
me
,
in
due
course
of
time
,
to
ascertain
the
purport
of
the
Young
Person
's
remarks
.
  
<EOS>
I
discovered
that
she
was
uneasy
in
her
mind
,
because
the
train
of
events
that
she
had
just
described
to
me
had
prevented
her
from
receiving
those
supplementary
messages
which
Miss
Halcombe
had
intrusted
to
the
Countess
to
deliver
.
<EOS>
She
was
afraid
the
messages
might
have
been
of
great
importance
to
her
mistress
's
interests
.
<EOS>
Her
dread
of
Sir
Percival
had
deterred
her
from
going
to
Blackwater
Park
late
at
night
to
inquire
about
them
,
and
Miss
Halcombe
's
own
directions
to
her
,
on
no
account
to
miss
the
train
in
the
morning
,
had
prevented
her
from
waiting
at
the
inn
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
She
was
most
anxious
that
the
misfortune
of
her
fainting
-
fit
should
not
lead
to
the
second
misfortune
of
making
her
mistress
think
her
neglectful
,
and
she
would
humbly
beg
to
ask
me
whether
I
would
advise
her
to
write
her
explanations
and
excuses
to
Miss
Halcombe
,
requesting
to
receive
the
messages
by
letter
,
if
it
was
not
too
late
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
apologies
for
this
extremely
prosy
paragraph
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
ordered
to
write
it
.
<EOS>
There
are
people
,
unaccountable
as
it
may
appear
,
who
actually
take
more
interest
in
what
my
niece
's
maid
said
to
me
on
this
occasion
than
in
what
I
said
to
my
niece
's
maid
.
<EOS>
Amusing
perversity
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
feel
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
sir
,
if
you
would
kindly
tell
me
what
I
had
better
do
,
"
remarked
the
Young
Person
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
things
stop
as
they
are
,
"
I
said
,
adapting
my
language
to
my
listener
.
<EOS>
"
I
invariably
let
things
stop
as
they
are
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Is
that
all
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
think
it
would
be
a
liberty
in
me
,
sir
,
to
write
,
of
course
I
would
n't
venture
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
so
very
anxious
to
do
all
I
can
to
serve
my
mistress
<EOS>
faithfully
 
"
  
People
in
the
lower
class
of
life
never
know
when
or
how
to
go
out
of
a
room
.
<EOS>
They
invariably
require
to
be
helped
out
by
their
betters
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
high
time
to
help
the
Young
Person
out
.
<EOS>
I
did
it
with
two
judicious
words
    
"
Good
-
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Something
outside
or
inside
this
singular
girl
suddenly
creaked
.
<EOS>
Louis
,
who
was
looking
at
her
(
which
I
was
not
)
,
says
she
creaked
when
she
curtseyed
.
<EOS>
Curious
.
<EOS>
Was
it
her
shoes
,
her
stays
,
or
her
bones
?
<EOS>
Louis
thinks
it
was
her
stays
.
<EOS>
Most
extraordinary
!
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
was
left
by
myself
I
had
a
little
nap
 
<EOS>
I
really
wanted
it
.
<EOS>
When
I
awoke
again
I
noticed
dear
Marian
's
letter
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
had
the
least
idea
of
what
it
contained
I
should
certainly
not
have
attempted
to
open
it
.
<EOS>
Being
,
unfortunately
for
myself
,
quite
innocent
of
all
suspicion
,
I
read
the
letter
.
<EOS>
It
immediately
upset
me
for
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
,
by
nature
,
one
of
the
most
easy
-
tempered
creatures
that
ever
lived
 
<EOS>
I
make
allowances
for
everybody
,
and
I
take
offence
at
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
as
I
have
before
remarked
,
there
are
limits
to
my
endurance
.
<EOS>
I
laid
down
Marian
's
letter
,
and
felt
myself
 
justly
felt
myself
 
an
injured
man
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
about
to
make
a
remark
.
<EOS>
It
is
,
of
course
,
applicable
to
the
very
serious
matter
now
under
notice
,
or
I
should
not
allow
it
to
appear
in
this
place
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
,
in
my
opinion
,
sets
the
odious
selfishness
of
mankind
in
such
a
repulsively
vivid
light
as
the
treatment
,
in
all
classes
of
society
,
which
the
Single
people
receive
at
the
hands
of
the
Married
people
.
<EOS>
When
you
have
once
shown
yourself
too
considerate
and
self
-
denying
to
add
a
family
of
your
own
to
an
already
overcrowded
population
,
you
are
vindictively
marked
out
by
your
married
friends
,
who
have
no
similar
consideration
and
no
similar
self
-
denial
,
as
the
recipient
of
half
their
conjugal
troubles
,
and
the
born
friend
of
all
their
children
.
<EOS>
Husbands
and
wives
TALK
of
the
cares
of
matrimony
,
and
bachelors
and
spinsters
BEAR
them
.
<EOS>
Take
my
own
case
.
<EOS>
I
considerately
remain
single
,
and
my
poor
dear
brother
Philip
inconsiderately
marries
.
<EOS>
What
does
he
do
when
he
dies
?
<EOS>
He
leaves
his
daughter
to
ME
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
sweet
girl
 
<EOS>
she
is
also
a
dreadful
responsibility
.
<EOS>
Why
lay
her
on
my
shoulders
?
<EOS>
Because
I
am
bound
,
in
the
harmless
character
of
a
single
man
,
to
relieve
my
married
connections
of
all
their
own
troubles
.
<EOS>
I
do
my
best
with
my
brother
's
responsibility
 
<EOS>
I
marry
my
niece
,
with
infinite
fuss
and
difficulty
,
to
the
man
her
father
wanted
her
to
marry
.
<EOS>
She
and
her
husband
disagree
,
and
unpleasant
consequences
follow
.
<EOS>
What
does
she
do
with
those
consequences
?
<EOS>
She
transfers
them
to
ME
.
<EOS>
Why
transfer
them
to
ME
?
<EOS>
Because
I
am
bound
,
in
the
harmless
character
of
a
single
man
,
to
relieve
my
married
connections
of
all
their
own
troubles
.
<EOS>
Poor
single
people
!
<EOS>
Poor
human
nature
!
  
<EOS>
It
is
quite
unnecessary
to
say
that
Marian
's
letter
threatened
me
.
<EOS>
Everybody
threatens
me
.
<EOS>
All
sorts
of
horrors
were
to
fall
on
my
devoted
head
if
I
hesitated
to
turn
Limmeridge
House
into
an
asylum
for
my
niece
and
her
misfortunes
.
<EOS>
I
did
hesitate
,
nevertheless
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
mentioned
that
my
usual
course
,
hitherto
,
had
been
to
submit
to
dear
Marian
,
and
save
noise
.
<EOS>
But
on
this
occasion
,
the
consequences
involved
in
her
extremely
inconsiderate
proposal
were
of
a
nature
to
make
me
pause
.
<EOS>
If
I
opened
Limmeridge
House
as
an
asylum
to
Lady
Glyde
,
what
security
had
I
against
Sir
Percival
Glyde
's
<EOS>
following
her
here
in
a
state
of
violent
resentment
against
ME
for
harbouring
his
wife
?
<EOS>
I
saw
such
a
perfect
labyrinth
of
troubles
involved
in
this
proceeding
that
I
determined
to
feel
my
ground
,
as
it
were
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
,
therefore
,
to
dear
Marian
to
beg
(
as
she
had
no
husband
to
lay
claim
to
her
)
that
she
would
come
here
by
herself
,
first
,
and
talk
the
matter
over
with
me
.
<EOS>
If
she
could
answer
my
objections
to
my
own
perfect
satisfaction
,
then
I
assured
her
that
I
would
receive
our
sweet
Laura
with
the
greatest
pleasure
,
but
not
otherwise
.
  
<EOS>
I
felt
,
of
course
,
at
the
time
,
that
this
temporising
on
my
part
would
probably
end
in
bringing
Marian
here
in
a
state
of
virtuous
indignation
,
banging
doors
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
the
other
course
of
proceeding
might
end
in
bringing
Sir
Percival
here
in
a
state
of
virtuous
indignation
,
banging
doors
also
,
and
of
the
two
indignations
and
bangings
<EOS>
I
preferred
Marian
's
,
because
I
was
used
to
her
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
I
despatched
the
letter
by
return
of
post
.
<EOS>
It
gained
me
time
,
at
all
events
 
<EOS>
and
,
oh
dear
me
!
<EOS>
what
a
point
that
was
to
begin
with
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
am
totally
prostrated
(
did
I
mention
that
I
was
totally
prostrated
by
Marian
's
letter
?
)
<EOS>
it
always
takes
me
three
days
to
get
up
again
.
<EOS>
I
was
very
unreasonable
 
<EOS>
I
expected
three
days
of
quiet
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
did
n't
get
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
third
day
's
post
brought
me
a
most
impertinent
letter
from
a
person
with
whom
I
was
totally
unacquainted
.
<EOS>
He
described
himself
as
the
acting
partner
of
our
man
of
business
 
our
dear
,
pig
-
headed
old
Gilmore
 
<EOS>
and
he
informed
me
that
he
had
lately
received
,
by
the
post
,
a
letter
addressed
to
him
in
Miss
Halcombe
's
handwriting
.
<EOS>
On
opening
the
envelope
,
he
had
discovered
,
to
his
astonishment
,
that
it
contained
nothing
but
a
blank
sheet
of
note
-
paper
.
<EOS>
This
circumstance
appeared
to
him
so
suspicious
(
as
suggesting
to
his
restless
legal
mind
that
the
letter
had
been
tampered
with
)
that
he
had
at
once
written
to
Miss
Halcombe
,
and
had
received
no
answer
by
return
of
post
.
<EOS>
In
this
difficulty
,
instead
of
acting
like
a
sensible
man
and
letting
things
take
their
proper
course
,
his
next
absurd
proceeding
,
on
his
own
showing
,
was
to
pester
me
by
writing
to
inquire
if
I
knew
anything
about
it
.
<EOS>
What
the
deuce
should
I
know
about
it
?
<EOS>
Why
alarm
me
as
well
as
himself
?
<EOS>
I
wrote
back
to
that
effect
.
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
my
keenest
letters
.
<EOS>
I
have
produced
nothing
with
a
sharper
epistolary
edge
to
it
since
I
tendered
his
dismissal
in
writing
to
that
extremely
troublesome
person
,
Mr.
Walter
Hartright
.
  
<EOS>
My
letter
produced
its
effect
.
<EOS>
I
heard
nothing
more
from
the
lawyer
.
  
<EOS>
This
perhaps
was
not
altogether
surprising
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
certainly
a
remarkable
circumstance
that
no
second
letter
reached
me
from
Marian
,
and
that
no
warning
signs
appeared
of
her
arrival
.
<EOS>
Her
unexpected
absence
did
me
amazing
good
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
very
soothing
and
pleasant
to
infer
(
as
I
did
of
course
)
that
my
married
connections
had
made
it
up
again
.
<EOS>
Five
days
of
undisturbed
tranquillity
,
of
delicious
single
blessedness
,
quite
restored
me
.
<EOS>
On
the
sixth
day
I
felt
strong
enough
to
send
for
my
photographer
,
and
to
set
him
at
work
again
on
the
presentation
copies
of
my
art
-
treasures
,
with
a
view
,
as
I
have
already
mentioned
,
to
the
improvement
of
taste
in
this
barbarous
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
I
had
just
dismissed
him
to
his
workshop
,
and
had
just
begun
coquetting
with
my
coins
,
when
Louis
suddenly
made
his
appearance
with
a
card
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Another
Young
Person
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
see
her
.
<EOS>
In
my
state
of
health
Young
Persons
disagree
with
me
.
<EOS>
Not
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
gentleman
this
time
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
gentleman
of
course
made
a
difference
.
<EOS>
I
looked
at
the
card
.
  
<EOS>
Gracious
Heaven
!
<EOS>
my
tiresome
sister
's
foreign
husband
,
Count
Fosco
.
  
<EOS>
Is
it
necessary
to
say
what
my
first
impression
was
when
I
looked
at
my
visitor
's
card
?
<EOS>
Surely
not
!
<EOS>
My
sister
having
married
a
foreigner
,
there
was
but
one
impression
that
any
man
in
his
senses
could
possibly
feel
.
<EOS>
Of
course
the
Count
had
come
to
borrow
money
of
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Louis
,
"
I
said
,
"
do
you
think
he
would
go
away
if
you
gave
him
five
shillings
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Louis
looked
quite
shocked
.
<EOS>
He
surprised
me
inexpressibly
by
declaring
that
my
sister
's
foreign
husband
was
dressed
superbly
,
and
looked
the
picture
of
prosperity
.
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
my
first
impression
altered
to
a
certain
extent
.
<EOS>
I
now
took
it
for
granted
that
the
Count
had
matrimonial
difficulties
of
his
own
to
contend
with
,
and
that
he
had
come
,
like
the
rest
of
the
family
,
to
cast
them
all
on
my
shoulders
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
he
mention
his
business
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Count
Fosco
said
he
had
come
here
,
sir
,
because
Miss
Halcombe
was
unable
to
leave
Blackwater
Park
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fresh
troubles
,
apparently
.
<EOS>
Not
exactly
his
own
,
as
I
had
supposed
,
but
dear
Marian
's
.
<EOS>
Troubles
,
anyway
.
<EOS>
Oh
dear
!
  
<EOS>
"
Show
him
in
,
"
I
said
resignedly
.
  
<EOS>
The
Count
's
first
appearance
really
startled
me
.
<EOS>
He
was
such
an
alarmingly
large
person
that
I
quite
trembled
.
<EOS>
I
felt
certain
that
he
would
shake
the
floor
and
knock
down
my
art
-
treasures
.
<EOS>
He
did
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
.
<EOS>
He
was
refreshingly
dressed
in
summer
costume
 
<EOS>
his
manner
was
delightfully
self
-
possessed
and
quiet
 
<EOS>
he
had
a
charming
smile
.
<EOS>
My
first
impression
of
him
was
highly
favourable
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
creditable
to
my
penetration
 
as
the
sequel
will
show
 
to
acknowledge
this
,
but
I
am
a
naturally
candid
man
,
and
I

acknowledge
it

<EOS>
"
Allow
me
to
present
myself
,
Mr.
Fairlie
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
come
from
Blackwater
Park
,
and
I
have
the
honour
and
the
happiness
of
being
Madame
Fosco
's
husband
.
<EOS>
Let
me
take
my
first
and
last
advantage
of
that
circumstance
by
entreating
you
not
to
make
a
stranger
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
beg
you
will
not
disturb
yourself
 
<EOS>
I
beg
you
will
not
move
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
good

"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
was
strong
enough
to
get
up

<EOS>
Charmed
to
see
you
at
Limmeridge

<EOS>
Please
take
a
chair

<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
you
are
suffering
to
-
day
,
"
said
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
usual
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
nothing
but
a
bundle
of
nerves
dressed
up
to
look
like
a
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
studied
many
subjects
in
my
time
,
"
remarked
this
sympathetic
person
.
"
<EOS>
Among
others
the
inexhaustible
subject
of
nerves
.
<EOS>
May
I
make
a
suggestion
,
at
once
the
simplest
and
the
most
profound
?
<EOS>
Will
you
let
me
alter
the
light
in
your
room
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
 
if
you
will
be
so
very
kind
as
not
to
let
any
of
it
in
on
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
walked
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
Such
a
contrast
to
dear
Marian
!
<EOS>
so
extremely
considerate
in
all
his
movements
!
  
<EOS>
"
Light
,
"
he
said
,
in
that
delightfully
confidential
tone
which
is
so
soothing
to
an
invalid
,
"
is
the
first
essential
.
<EOS>
Light
stimulates
,
nourishes
,
preserves
.
<EOS>
You
can
no
more
do
without
it
,
Mr.
Fairlie
,
than
if
you
were
a
flower
.
<EOS>
Observe
.
<EOS>
Here
,
where
you
sit
,
I
close
the
shutters
to
compose
you
.
<EOS>
There
,
where
you
do
NOT
sit
,
I
draw
up
the
blind
and
let
in
the
invigorating
sun
.
<EOS>
Admit
the
light
into
your
room
if
you
can
not
bear
it
on
yourself
.
<EOS>
Light
,
sir
,
is
the
grand
decree
of
Providence
.
<EOS>
You
accept
Providence
with
your
own
restrictions
.
<EOS>
Accept
light
on
the
same
terms
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thought
this
very
convincing
and
attentive
.
<EOS>
He
had
taken
me
in
up
to
that
point
about
the
light
,
he
had
certainly
taken
me
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
me
confused
,
"
he
said
,
returning
to
his
place
 
"
on
my
word
of
honour
,
Mr.
Fairlie
,
you
see
me
confused
in
your
presence

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shocked
to
hear
it
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
May
I
inquire
why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
can
I
enter
this
room
(
where
you
sit
a
sufferer
)
,
and
see
you
surrounded
by
these
admirable
objects
of
Art
,
without
discovering
that
you
are
a
man
whose
feelings
are
acutely
impressionable
,
whose
sympathies
are
perpetually
alive
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
can
I
do
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
strong
enough
to
sit
up
in
my
chair
<EOS>
I
should
,
of
course
,
have
bowed
.
<EOS>
Not
being
strong
enough
,
I
smiled
my
acknowledgments
instead
.
<EOS>
It
did
<EOS>
just
as
well
,
we
both
understood
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
follow
my
train
of
thought
,
"
continued
the
Count
.
<EOS>
"
I
sit
here
,
a
man
of
refined
sympathies
myself
,
in
the
presence
of
another
man
of
refined
sympathies
also
.
<EOS>
I
am
conscious
of
a
terrible
necessity
for
lacerating
those
sympathies
by
referring
to
domestic
events
of
a
very
melancholy
kind
.
<EOS>
What
is
the
inevitable
consequence
?
<EOS>
I
have
done
myself
the
honour
of
pointing
it
out
to
you
already
.
<EOS>
I
sit
confused
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Was
it
at
this
point
that
I
began
to
suspect
he
was
going
to
bore
me
?
<EOS>
I
rather
think
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
absolutely
necessary
to
refer
to
these
unpleasant
matters
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
<EOS>
"
In
our
homely
English
phrase
,
Count
Fosco
,
wo
n't
they
keep
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
Count
,
with
the
most
alarming
solemnity
,
sighed
and
shook
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Must
I
really
hear
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
<EOS>
(
it
was
the
first
foreign
thing
he
had
done
since
he
had
been
in
the
room
)
,
and
looked
at
me
in
an
unpleasantly
penetrating
manner
.
<EOS>
My
instincts
told
me
that
I
had
better
close
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
obeyed
my
instincts
.
  
<EOS>
"
Please
break
it
gently
,
"
I
pleaded
.
<EOS>
"
Anybody
dead
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dead
!
"
cried
the
Count
,
with
unnecessary
foreign
fierceness
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
,
your
national
composure
terrifies
me
.
<EOS>
In
the
name
of
Heaven
,
what
have
I
said
or
done
to
make
you
think
me
the
messenger
of
death
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
accept
my
apologies
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
said
and
done
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
make
it
a
rule
in
these
distressing
cases
always
to
anticipate
the
worst
.
<EOS>
It
breaks
the
blow
by
meeting
it
half
-
way
,
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
Inexpressibly
relieved
,
I
am
sure
,
to
hear
that
nobody
is
dead
.
<EOS>
Anybody
ill
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
opened
my
eyes
and
looked
at
him
.
<EOS>
Was
he
very
yellow
when
he
came
in
,
or
had
he
turned
very
yellow
in
the
last
minute
or
two
?
<EOS>
I
really
ca
n't
say
,
and
I
ca
n't
ask
Louis
,
because
he
was
not
in
the
room
at
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
Anybody
ill
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeated
,
observing
that
my
national
composure
still
appeared
to
affect
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
part
of
my
bad
news
,
Mr.
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Somebody
is
ill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Grieved
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
Which
of
them
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
my
profound
sorrow
,
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
were
in
some
degree
prepared
to
hear
this
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
when
you
found
that
Miss
Halcombe
did
not
come
here
by
herself
,
as
you
proposed
,
and
did
not
write
a
second
time
,
your
affectionate
anxiety
may
have
made
you
fear
that
she
was
ill
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
my
affectionate
anxiety
had
led
to
that
melancholy
apprehension
at
some
time
or
other
,
but
at
the
moment
my
wretched
memory
entirely
failed
to
remind
me
of
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
said
yes
,
in
justice
to
myself
.
<EOS>
I
was
much
shocked
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
very
uncharacteristic
of
such
a
robust
person
as
dear
Marian
to
be
ill
,
that
I
could
only
suppose
she
had
met
with
an
accident
.
<EOS>
A
horse
,
or
a
false
step
on
the
stairs
,
or
something
of
that
sort
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
serious
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Serious
 
beyond
a
doubt
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Dangerous
 
I
hope
and
trust
not
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
unhappily
exposed
herself
to
be
wetted
through
by
a
heavy
rain
.
<EOS>
The
cold
that
followed
was
of
an
aggravated
kind
,
and
it
has
now
brought
with
it
the
worst
consequence
 
fever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
I
heard
the
word
fever
,
and
when
I
remembered
at
the
same
moment
that
the
unscrupulous
person
who
was
now
addressing
me
had
just
come
from
Blackwater
Park
,
I
thought
I
should
have
fainted
on
the
spot
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
God
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
infectious
?
"
  
"
Not
at
present
,
"
he
answered
,
with
detestable
composure
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
turn
to
infection
 
but
no
such
deplorable
complication
had
taken
place
when
I
left
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
I
have
felt
the
deepest
interest
in
the
case
,
Mr.
Fairlie
 
I
have
endeavoured
to
assist
the
regular
medical
attendant
in
watching
it
 
accept
my
personal
assurances
of
the
uninfectious
nature
of
the
fever
when
I
last
saw
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Accept
his
assurances
!
<EOS>
I
never
was
farther
from
accepting
anything
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
have
believed
him
on
his
oath
.
<EOS>
He
was
too
yellow
to
be
believed
.
<EOS>
He
looked
like
a
walking
-
West
-
Indian
-
epidemic
.
<EOS>
He
was
big
enough
to
carry
typhus
by
the
ton
,
and
to
dye
the
very
carpet
he
walked
on
with
scarlet
fever
.
<EOS>
In
certain
emergencies
my
mind
is
remarkably
soon
made
up
.
<EOS>
I
instantly
determined
to
get
rid
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
kindly
excuse
an
invalid
,
"
I
said
 
"
but
long
conferences
of
any
kind
invariably
upset
me
.
<EOS>
May
I
beg
to
know
exactly
what
the
object
is
to
which
I
am
indebted
for
the
honour
of
your
visit
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
fervently
hoped
that
this
remarkably
broad
hint
would
throw
him
off
his
balance
 
<EOS>
confuse
him
 
reduce
him
to
polite
apologies
 
in
short
,
get
him
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
it
only
settled
him
in
his
chair
.
<EOS>
He
became
additionally
solemn
,
and
dignified
,
and
confidential
.
<EOS>
He
held
up
two
of
his
horrid
fingers
and
gave
me
another
of
his
unpleasantly
penetrating
looks
.
<EOS>
What
was
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
I
was
not
strong
enough
to
quarrel
with
him
.
<EOS>
Conceive
my
situation
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
Is
language
adequate
to
describe
it
?
<EOS>
I
think
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
objects
of
my
visit
,
"
he
went
on
,
quite
irrepressibly
,
"
are
numbered
on
my
fingers
.
<EOS>
They
are
two
.
<EOS>
First
,
I
come
to
bear
my
testimony
,
with
profound
sorrow
,
to
the
lamentable
disagreements
between
Sir
Percival
and
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
I
am
Sir
Percival
's
oldest
friend
 
<EOS>
I
am
related
to
Lady
Glyde
by
marriage
 
<EOS>
I
am
an
eye
-
witness
of
all
that
has
happened
at
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
In
those
three
capacities
I
speak
with
authority
,
with
confidence
,
with
honourable
regret
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
inform
you
,
as
the
head
of
Lady
Glyde
's
family
,
that
Miss
Halcombe
has
exaggerated
nothing
in
the
letter
which
she
wrote
to
your
address
.
<EOS>
I
affirm
that
the
remedy
which
that
admirable
lady
has
proposed
is
the
only
remedy
that
will
spare
you
the
horrors
of
public
scandal
.
<EOS>
A
temporary
separation
between
husband
and
wife
is
the
one
peaceable
solution
of
this
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Part
them
for
the
present
,
and
when
all
causes
of
irritation
are
removed
,
I
,
who
have
now
the
honour
of
addressing
you
 
I
will
undertake
to
bring
Sir
Percival
to
reason
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
is
innocent
,
Lady
Glyde
is
injured
,
but
 
follow
my
thought
here
!
 
<EOS>
she
is
,
on
that
very
account
(
I
say
it
with
shame
)
,
the
cause
of
irritation
while
she
remains
under
her
husband
's
roof
.
<EOS>
No
other
house
can
receive
her
with
propriety
but
yours
.
<EOS>
I
invite
you
to
open
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Cool
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
matrimonial
hailstorm
pouring
in
the
South
of
England
,
and
I
was
invited
,
by
a
man
with
fever
in
every
fold
of
his
coat
,
to
come
out
from
the
North
of
England
and
take
my
share
of
the
pelting
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
put
the
point
forcibly
,
just
as
I
have
put
it
here
.
<EOS>
The
Count
deliberately
lowered
one
of
his
horrid
fingers
,
kept
the
other
up
,
and
went
on
 
rode
over
me
,
as
it
were
,
without
even
the
common
coach
-
manlike
attention
of
crying
"
Hi
!
"
<EOS>
before
he
knocked
me
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Follow
my
thought
once
more
,
if
you
please
,
"
he
resumed
.
<EOS>
"
My
first
object
you
have
heard
.
<EOS>
My
second
object
in
coming
to
this
house
is
to
do
what
Miss
Halcombe
's
illness
has
prevented
her
from
doing
for
herself
.
<EOS>
My
large
experience
is
consulted
on
all
difficult
matters
at
Blackwater
Park
,
and
my
friendly
advice
was
requested
on
the
interesting
subject
of
your
letter
to
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
I
understood
at
once
 
for
my
sympathies
are
your
sympathies
 
why
you
wished
to
see
her
here
before
you
pledged
yourself
to
inviting
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
You
are
most
right
,
sir
,
in
hesitating
to
receive
the
wife
until
you
are
quite
certain
that
the
husband
will
not
exert
his
authority
to
reclaim
her
.
<EOS>
I
agree
to
that
.
<EOS>
I
also
agree
that
such
delicate
explanations
as
this
difficulty
involves
are
not
explanations
which
can
be
properly
disposed
of
by
writing
only
.
<EOS>
My
presence
here
(
to
my
own
great
inconvenience
)
is
the
proof
that
I
speak
sincerely
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
explanations
themselves
,
I
 
Fosco
 
I
,
who
know
Sir
Percival
much
better
than
Miss
Halcombe
knows
him
,
affirm
to
you
,
on
my
honour
and
my
word
,
that
he
will
not
come
near
this
house
,
or
attempt
to
communicate
with
this
house
,
while
his
wife
is
living
in
it
.
<EOS>
His
affairs
are
embarrassed
.
<EOS>
Offer
him
his
freedom
by
means
of
the
absence
of
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
I
promise
you
he
will
take
his
freedom
,
and
go
back
to
the
Continent
at
the
earliest
moment
when
he
can
get
away
.
<EOS>
Is
this
clear
to
you
as
crystal
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
it
is
.
<EOS>
Have
you
questions
to
address
to
me
?
<EOS>
Be
it
so
<EOS>
,
I
am
here
to
answer
.
<EOS>
Ask
,
Mr.
Fairlie
 
oblige
me
by
asking
to
your
heart
's
content
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
said
so
much
already
in
spite
of
me
,
and
he
looked
so
dreadfully
capable
of
saying
a
great
deal
more
also
in
spite
of
me
,
that
I
declined
his
amiable
invitation
in
pure
self
-
defence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Many
thanks
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sinking
fast
.
<EOS>
In
my
state
of
health
I
must
take
things
for
granted
.
<EOS>
Allow
me
to
do
so
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
We
quite
understand
each
other
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Much
obliged
,
I
am
sure
,
for
your
kind
interference
.
<EOS>
If
I
ever
get
better
,
and
ever
have
a
second
opportunity
of
improving
our
acquaintance
 
"
  
<EOS>
He
got
up
.
<EOS>
I
thought
he
was
going
.
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
More
talk
,
more
time
for
the
development
of
infectious
influences
 
in
my
room
<EOS>
,
too
 
remember
that
,
in
my
room
!
  
<EOS>
"
One
moment
yet
,
"
he
said
,
"
one
moment
before
I
take
my
leave
.
<EOS>
I
ask
permission
at
parting
to
impress
on
you
an
urgent
necessity
.
<EOS>
It
is
this
,
sir
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
think
of
waiting
till
Miss
Halcombe
recovers
before
you
receive
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
has
the
attendance
of
the
doctor
,
of
the
housekeeper
at
Blackwater
Park
,
and
of
an
experienced
nurse
as
well
 
three
persons
for
whose
capacity
and
devotion
I
answer
with
my
life
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
that
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
also
,
that
the
anxiety
and
alarm
of
her
sister
's
illness
has
already
affected
the
health
and
spirits
of
Lady
Glyde
,
and
has
made
her
totally
unfit
to
be
of
use
in
the
sick
-
room
.
<EOS>
Her
position
with
her
husband
grows
more
and
more
deplorable
and
dangerous
every
day
.
<EOS>
If
you
leave
her
any
longer
at
Blackwater
Park
,
you
do
nothing
whatever
to
hasten
her
sister
's
recovery
,
and
at
the
same
time
,
you
risk
the
public
scandal
,
which
you
and
I
,
and
all
of
us
,
are
bound
in
the
sacred
interests
of
the
family
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
With
all
my
soul
,
I
advise
you
to
remove
the
serious
responsibility
of
delay
from
your
own
shoulders
by
writing
to
Lady
Glyde
to
come
here
at
once
.
<EOS>
Do
your
affectionate
,
your
honourable
,
your
inevitable
duty
,
and
whatever
happens
in
the
future
,
no
one
can
lay
the
blame
on
you
.
<EOS>
I
speak
from
my
large
experience
 
<EOS>
I
offer
my
friendly
advice
.
<EOS>
Is
it
accepted
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
or
No
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
looked
at
him
 
<EOS>
merely
looked
at
him
 
with
my
sense
of
his
amazing
assurance
,
and
my
dawning
resolution
to
ring
for
Louis
and
have
him
shown
out
of
the
room
expressed
in
every
line
of
my
face
.
<EOS>
It
is
perfectly
incredible
,
but
quite
true
,
that
my
face
did
not
appear
to
produce
the
slightest
impression
on
him
.
<EOS>
Born
without
nerves
 
evidently
born
without
nerves
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
hesitate
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
!
<EOS>
I
understand
that
hesitation
.
<EOS>
You
object
 
<EOS>
see
,
sir
,
how
my
sympathies
look
straight
down
into
your
thoughts
!
 
<EOS>
you
object
that
Lady
Glyde
is
not
in
health
and
not
in
spirits
to
take
the
long
journey
,
from
Hampshire
to
this
place
,
by
herself
.
<EOS>
Her
own
maid
is
removed
from
her
,
as
you
know
,
and
of
other
servants
fit
to
travel
with
her
,
from
one
end
of
England
to
another
,
there
are
none
at
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
You
object
,
again
,
that
she
can
not
comfortably
stop
and
rest
in
London
,
on
her
way
here
,
because
she
can
not
comfortably
go
alone
to
a
public
hotel
where
she
is
a
total
stranger
.
<EOS>
In
one
breath
,
I
grant
both
objections
 
in
another
breath
,
I
remove
them
.
<EOS>
Follow
me
,
if
you
please
,
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
It
was
my
intention
,
when
I
returned
to
England
with
Sir
Percival
,
to
settle
myself
in
the
neighbourhood
of
London
.
<EOS>
That
purpose
has
just
been
happily
accomplished
.
<EOS>
I
have
taken
,
for
six
months
,
a
little
furnished
house
in
the
quarter
called
St.
John
's
Wood
.
<EOS>
Be
so
obliging
as
to
keep
this
fact
in
your
mind
,
and
observe
the
programme
I
now
propose
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
travels
to
London
(
a
short
journey
)
 
<EOS>
I
myself
meet
her
at
the
station
 
<EOS>
I
take
her
to
rest
and
sleep
at
my
house
,
which
is
also
the
house
of
her
aunt
 
when
she
is
restored
<EOS>
I
escort
her
to
the
station
<EOS>
again
 
she
travels
to
this
place
,
and
her
own
maid
(
who
is
now
under
your
roof
)
receives
her
at
the
carriage
-
door
.
<EOS>
Here
is
<EOS>
comfort
consulted
 
here
are
the
interests
of
propriety
consulted
 
here
<EOS>
is
your
own
duty
 
duty
of
hospitality
,
sympathy
,
protection
,
to
an
unhappy
lady
in
need
of
all
three
 
smoothed
and
made
easy
,
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
I
cordially
invite
you
,
sir
,
to
second
my
efforts
in
the
sacred
interests
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
I
seriously
advise
you
to
write
,
by
my
hands
,
offering
the
hospitality
of
your
house
(
and
heart
)
,
and
the
hospitality
of
my
house
(
and
heart
)
,
to
that
injured
and
unfortunate
lady
whose
cause
I
plead
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
waved
his
horrid
hand
at
me
 
he
struck
his
infectious
breast
 
<EOS>
he
addressed
me
oratorically
,
as
if
I
was
laid
up
in
the
House
of
Commons
.
<EOS>
It
was
high
time
to
take
a
desperate
course
of
some
sort
.
<EOS>
It
was
also
high
time
to
send
for
Louis
,
and
adopt
the
precaution
of
fumigating
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
trying
emergency
an
idea
occurred
to
me
 
an
inestimable
idea
which
,
so
to
speak
,
killed
two
intrusive
birds
with
one
stone
.
<EOS>
I
determined
to
get
rid
of
the
Count
's
tiresome
eloquence
,
and
of
Lady
Glyde
's
tiresome
troubles
,
by
complying
with
this
odious
foreigner
's
request
,
and
writing
the
letter
at
once
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
the
least
danger
of
the
invitation
being
accepted
,
for
there
was
not
the
least
chance
that
Laura
would
consent
to
leave
Blackwater
Park
while
Marian
was
lying
there
ill
.
<EOS>
How
this
charmingly
convenient
obstacle
could
have
escaped
the
officious
penetration
of
the
Count
,
it
was
impossible
to
conceive
 
<EOS>
but
it
HAD
escaped
him
.
<EOS>
My
dread
that
he
might
yet
discover
it
,
if
I
allowed
him
any
more
time
to
think
,
stimulated
me
to
such
an
amazing
degree
,
that
I
struggled
into
a
sitting
position
 
seized
,
really
seized
,
the
writing
materials
by
my
side
,
and
produced
the
letter
as
rapidly
as
if
I
had
been
a
common
clerk
in
an
office
.
"
<EOS>
Dearest
Laura
,
Please
come
,
whenever
you
like
.
<EOS>
Break
the
journey
by
sleeping
in
London
at
your
aunt
's
house
.
<EOS>
Grieved
to
hear
of
dear
Marian
's
illness
.
<EOS>
Ever
affectionately
yours
.
<EOS>
"
I
handed
these
lines
,
at
arm
's
length
,
to
the
Count
 
<EOS>
I
sank
back
in
my
chair
 
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
Excuse
me
 
<EOS>
I
am
entirely
prostrated
 
<EOS>
I
can
do
no
more
.
<EOS>
Will
you
rest
and
lunch
downstairs
?
<EOS>
Love
to
all
,
and
sympathy
,
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
Good
-
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
made
another
speech
 
the
man
was
absolutely
inexhaustible
.
<EOS>
I
closed
my
eyes
 
<EOS>
I
endeavoured
to
hear
as
little
as
possible
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
my
endeavours
I
was
obliged
to
hear
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
My
sister
's
endless
husband
congratulated
himself
,
and
congratulated
me
,
on
the
result
of
our
interview
 
<EOS>
he
mentioned
a
great
deal
more
about
his
sympathies
and
mine
 
<EOS>
he
deplored
my
miserable
health
 
<EOS>
he
offered
to
write
me
a
prescription
 
<EOS>
he
impressed
on
me
the
necessity
of
not
forgetting
what
he
had
said
about
the
importance
of
light
 
<EOS>
he
accepted
my
obliging
invitation
to
rest
and
lunch
 
<EOS>
he
recommended
me
to
expect
Lady
Glyde
in
two
or
three
days
'
time
 
he
begged
my
permission
to
look
forward
to
our
next
meeting
,
instead
of
paining
himself
and
paining
me
,
by
saying
farewell
 
he
added
a
great
deal
more
,
which
,
I
rejoice
to
think
,
I
did
not
attend
to
at
the
time
,
and
do
not
remember
now
.
<EOS>
I
heard
his
sympathetic
voice
travelling
away
from
me
by
degrees
 
<EOS>
but
,
large
as
he
was
,
I
never
heard
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
negative
merit
of
being
absolutely
noiseless
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
when
he
opened
the
door
,
or
when
he
shut
it
.
<EOS>
I
ventured
to
make
use
of
my
eyes
again
,
after
an
interval
of
silence
 
<EOS>
and
he
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
I
rang
for
Louis
,
and
retired
to
my
bathroom
.
<EOS>
Tepid
water
,
strengthened
with
aromatic
vinegar
,
for
myself
,
and
copious
fumigation
for
my
study
,
were
the
obvious
precautions
to
take
,
and
of
course
I
adopted
them
.
<EOS>
I
rejoice
to
say
they
proved
successful
.
<EOS>
I
enjoyed
my
customary
siesta
.
<EOS>
I
awoke
moist
and
cool
.
  
<EOS>
My
first
inquiries
were
for
the
Count
.
<EOS>
Had
we
really
got
rid
of
him
?
<EOS>
Yes
 
he
had
gone
away
by
the
afternoon
train
.
<EOS>
Had
he
lunched
,
and
if
so
,
upon
what
?
<EOS>
Entirely
upon
fruit
-
tart
and
cream
.
<EOS>
What
a
man
!
<EOS>
What
a
digestion
!
  
<EOS>
Am
I
expected
to
say
anything
more
?
<EOS>
I
believe
not
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
have
reached
the
limits
assigned
to
me
.
<EOS>
The
shocking
circumstances
which
happened
at
a
later
period
did
not
,
I
am
thankful
to
say
,
happen
in
my
presence
.
<EOS>
I
do
beg
and
entreat
that
nobody
will
be
so
very
unfeeling
as
to
lay
any
part
of
the
blame
of
those
circumstances
on
me
.
<EOS>
I
did
everything
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
answerable
for
a
deplorable
calamity
,
which
it
was
quite
impossible
to
foresee
.
<EOS>
I
am
shattered
by
it
 
<EOS>
I
have
suffered
under
it
,
as
nobody
else
has
suffered
.
<EOS>
My
servant
,
Louis
(
who
is
really
attached
to
me
in
his
unintelligent
way
)
,
thinks
I
shall
never
get
over
it
.
<EOS>
He
sees
me
dictating
at
this
moment
,
with
my
handkerchief
to
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
mention
,
in
justice
to
myself
,
that
it
was
not
my
fault
,
and
that
I
am
quite
exhausted
and
heartbroken
.
<EOS>
Need
<EOS>
I
say
more
?

THE
STORY
CONTINUED
BY
ELIZA
MICHELSON
  
<EOS>
(
Housekeeper
at
Blackwater
Park
)
      
<EOS>
I
am
asked
to
state
plainly
what
I
know
of
the
progress
of
Miss
Halcombe
's
illness
and
of
the
circumstances
under
which
Lady
Glyde
left
Blackwater
Park
for
London
.
  
<EOS>
The
reason
given
for
making
this
demand
on
me
is
,
that
my
testimony
is
wanted
in
the
interests
of
truth
.
<EOS>
As
the
widow
of
a
clergyman
of
the
Church
of
England
(
reduced
by
misfortune
to
the
necessity
of
accepting
a
situation
)
,
I
have
been
taught
to
place
the
claims
of
truth
above
all
other
considerations
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
comply
with
a
request
which
I
might
otherwise
,
through
reluctance
to
connect
myself
with
distressing
family
affairs
,
have
hesitated
to
grant
.
  
<EOS>
I
made
no
memorandum
at
the
time
,
and
I
can
not
therefore
be
sure
to
a
day
of
the
date
,
but
I
believe
I
am
correct
in
stating
that
Miss
Halcombe
's
serious
illness
began
during
the
last
fortnight
or
ten
days
in
June
.
<EOS>
The
breakfast
hour
was
late
at
Blackwater
Park
 
sometimes
as
late
as
ten
,
never
earlier
than
half
-
past
nine
.
<EOS>
On
the
morning
to
which
I
am
now
referring
,
Miss
Halcombe
(
who
was
usually
the
first
to
come
down
)
did
not
make
her
appearance
at
the
table
.
<EOS>
After
the
family
had
waited
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
the
upper
housemaid
was
sent
to
see
after
her
,
and
came
running
out
of
the
room
dreadfully
frightened
.
<EOS>
I
met
the
servant
on
the
stairs
,
and
went
at
once
to
Miss
Halcombe
to
see
what
was
the
matter
.
<EOS>
The
poor
lady
was
incapable
of
telling
me
.
<EOS>
She
was
walking
about
her
room
with
a
pen
in
her
hand
,
quite
light
-
headed
,
in
a
state
of
burning
fever
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
(
being
no
longer
in
Sir
Percival
's
service
,
I
may
,
without
impropriety
,
mention
my
former
mistress
by
her
name
,
instead
of
calling
her
my
lady
)
was
the
first
to
come
in
from
her
own
bedroom
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
dreadfully
alarmed
and
distressed
that
she
was
quite
useless
.
<EOS>
The
Count
Fosco
,
and
his
lady
,
who
came
upstairs
immediately
afterwards
,
were
both
most
serviceable
and
kind
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
assisted
me
to
get
Miss
Halcombe
to
her
bed
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
the
Count
remained
in
the
sitting
-
room
,
and
having
sent
for
my
medicine
-
chest
,
made
a
mixture
for
Miss
Halcombe
,
and
a
cooling
lotion
to
be
applied
to
her
head
,
so
as
to
lose
no
time
before
the
doctor
came
.
<EOS>
We
applied
the
lotion
,
but
we
could
not
get
her
to
take
the
mixture
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
undertook
to
send
for
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
He
despatched
a
groom
,
on
horseback
,
for
the
nearest
medical
man
,
Mr.
Dawson
,
of
Oak
Lodge
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
arrived
in
less
than
an
hour
's
time
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
respectable
elderly
man
,
well
known
<EOS>
all
round
the
country
,
and
we
were
much
alarmed
when
we
found
that
he
considered
the
case
to
be
a
very
serious
one
.
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
the
Count
affably
entered
into
conversation
with
Mr.
Dawson
,
and
gave
his
opinions
with
a
judicious
freedom
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
,
not
over
-
courteously
,
inquired
if
his
lordship
's
advice
was
the
advice
of
a
doctor
,
and
being
informed
that
it
was
the
advice
of
one
who
had
studied
medicine
unprofessionally
,
replied
that
he
was
not
accustomed
to
consult
with
amateur
physicians
.
<EOS>
The
Count
,
with
truly
Christian
meekness
of
temper
,
smiled
and
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
Before
he
went
out
he
told
me
that
he
might
be
found
,
in
case
he
was
wanted
in
the
course
of
the
day
,
at
the
boat
-
house
on
the
banks
of
the
lake
.
<EOS>
Why
he
should
have
gone
there
,
I
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
go
,
remaining
away
the
whole
day
till
seven
o'clock
,
which
was
dinner
-
time
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
wished
to
set
the
example
of
keeping
the
house
as
quiet
as
possible
.
<EOS>
It
was
entirely
in
his
character
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
most
considerate
nobleman
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
passed
a
very
bad
night
,
the
fever
coming
and
going
,
and
getting
worse
towards
the
morning
instead
of
better
.
<EOS>
No
nurse
fit
to
wait
on
her
being
at
hand
in
the
neighbourhood
,
<EOS>
her
ladyship
the
Countess
and
myself
undertook
the
duty
,
relieving
each
other
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
,
most
unwisely
,
insisted
on
sitting
up
with
us
.
<EOS>
She
was
much
too
nervous
and
too
delicate
in
health
to
bear
the
anxiety
of
Miss
Halcombe
's
illness
calmly
.
<EOS>
She
only
did
herself
harm
,
without
being
of
the
least
real
assistance
.
<EOS>
A
more
gentle
and
affectionate
lady
never
lived
 
but
she
cried
,
and
she
was
frightened
,
two
weaknesses
which
made
her
entirely
unfit
to
be
present
in
a
sick
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
came
in
the
morning
to
make
their
inquiries
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
(
from
distress
,
I
presume
,
at
his
lady
's
affliction
and
at
Miss
Halcombe
's
illness
)
appeared
much
confused
and
unsettled
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
testified
,
on
the
contrary
,
a
becoming
composure
and
interest
.
<EOS>
He
had
his
straw
hat
in
one
hand
,
and
his
book
in
the
other
,
and
he
mentioned
to
Sir
Percival
in
my
hearing
that
he
would
go
out
again
and
study
at
the
lake
.
"
<EOS>
Let
us
keep
the
house
quiet
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
not
smoke
indoors
,
my
friend
,
now
Miss
Halcombe
is
ill
.
<EOS>
You
go
your
way
,
and
I
will
go
mine
.
<EOS>
When
I
study
I
like
to
be
alone
.
<EOS>
Good
-
morning
,
Mrs.
Michelson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
was
not
civil
enough
 
<EOS>
perhaps
I
ought
in
justice
to
say
,
not
composed
enough
 
to
take
leave
of
me
with
the
same
polite
attention
.
<EOS>
The
only
person
in
the
house
,
indeed
,
who
treated
me
,
at
that
time
or
at
any
other
,
on
the
footing
of
a
lady
in
distressed
circumstances
,
was
the
Count
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
manners
of
a
true
nobleman
 
<EOS>
he
was
considerate
towards
every
one
.
<EOS>
Even
the
young
person
(
Fanny
by
name
)
who
attended
on
Lady
Glyde
was
not
beneath
his
notice
.
<EOS>
When
she
was
sent
away
by
Sir
Percival
,
his
lordship
(
showing
me
his
sweet
little
birds
at
the
time
)
was
most
kindly
anxious
to
know
what
had
become
of
her
,
where
she
was
to
go
the
day
she
left
Blackwater
Park
,
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
It
is
in
such
little
delicate
attentions
that
the
advantages
of
aristocratic
birth
always
show
themselves
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
apology
for
introducing
these
particulars
 
they
are
brought
forward
in
justice
to
his
lordship
,
whose
character
,
I
have
reason
to
know
,
is
viewed
rather
harshly
in
certain
quarters
.
<EOS>
A
nobleman
who
can
respect
a
lady
in
distressed
circumstances
,
and
can
take
a
fatherly
interest
in
the
fortunes
of
an
humble
servant
girl
,
shows
principles
and
feelings
of
too
high
an
order
to
be
lightly
called
in
question
.
<EOS>
I
advance
no
opinions
 
<EOS>
I
offer
facts
only
.
<EOS>
My
endeavour
through
life
is
to
judge
not
that
I
be
not
judged
.
<EOS>
One
of
my
beloved
husband
's
finest
sermons
was
on
that
text
.
<EOS>
I
read
it
constantly
 
in
my
own
copy
of
the
edition
printed
by
subscription
,
in
the
first
days
of
my
widowhood
 
and
at
every
fresh
perusal
I
derive
an
increase
of
spiritual
benefit
and
edification
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
improvement
in
Miss
Halcombe
,
and
the
second
night
was
even
worse
than
the
first
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
was
constant
in
his
attendance
.
<EOS>
The
practical
duties
of
nursing
were
still
divided
between
the
Countess
and
myself
,
Lady
Glyde
persisting
in
sitting
up
with
us
,
though
we
both
entreated
her
to
take
some
rest
.
<EOS>
"
My
place
is
by
Marian
's
bedside
,
"
was
her
only
answer
.
<EOS>
"
Whether
I
am
ill
,
or
well
,
nothing
will
induce
me
to
lose
sight
of
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Towards
midday
I
went
downstairs
to
attend
to
some
of
my
regular
duties
.
<EOS>
An
hour
afterwards
,
on
my
way
back
to
the
sick
-
room
,
I
saw
the
Count
(
who
had
gone
out
again
early
,
for
the
third
time
)
entering
the
hall
,
to
all
appearance
in
the
highest
good
spirits
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
,
at
the
same
moment
,
put
his
head
out
of
the
library
door
,
and
addressed
his
noble
friend
,
with
extreme
eagerness
,
in
these
words
    
"
Have
you
found
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
's
large
face
became
dimpled
all
over
with
placid
smiles
,
but
he
made
no
reply
in
words
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
Sir
Percival
turned
his
head
,
observed
that
I
was
approaching
the
stairs
,
and
looked
at
me
in
the
most
rudely
angry
manner
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
in
here
and
tell
me
about
it
,
"
he
said
to
the
Count
.
<EOS>
"
Whenever
there
are
women
in
a
house
they
're
always
sure
to
be
going
up
or
down
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Percival
,
"
observed
his
lordship
kindly
,
"
Mrs.
Michelson
has
duties
.
<EOS>
Pray
recognise
her
admirable
performance
of
them
as
sincerely
as
I
do
!
<EOS>
How
is
the
sufferer
,
Mrs.
Michelson
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
better
,
my
lord
,
I
regret
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Sad
 
most
sad
!
"
remarked
the
Count
.
<EOS>
"
You
look
fatigued
,
Mrs.
Michelson
.
<EOS>
It
is
certainly
time
you
and
my
wife
had
some
help
in
nursing
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
may
be
the
means
of
offering
you
that
help
.
<EOS>
Circumstances
have
happened
which
will
oblige
Madame
Fosco
to
travel
to
London
either
to
-
morrow
or
the
day
after
.
<EOS>
She
will
go
away
in
the
morning
and
return
at
night
,
and
she
will
bring
back
with
her
,
to
relieve
you
,
a
nurse
of
excellent
conduct
and
capacity
,
who
is
now
disengaged
.
<EOS>
The
woman
is
known
to
my
wife
as
a
person
to
be
trusted
.
<EOS>
Before
she
comes
here
say
nothing
about
her
,
if
you
please
,
to
the
doctor
,
because
he
will
look
with
an
evil
eye
on
any
nurse
of
my
providing
.
<EOS>
When
she
appears
in
this
house
she
will
speak
for
herself
,
and
Mr.
Dawson
will
be
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
there
is
no
excuse
for
not
employing
her
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
will
say
the
same
.
<EOS>
Pray
present
my
best
respects
and
sympathies
to
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
expressed
my
grateful
acknowledgments
for
his
lordship
's
kind
consideration
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
cut
them
short
by
calling
to
his
noble
friend
(
using
,
I
regret
to
say
,
a
profane
expression
)
to
come
into
the
library
,
and
not
to
keep
him
waiting
there
any
longer
.
  
<EOS>
I
proceeded
upstairs
.
<EOS>
We
are
poor
erring
creatures
,
and
however
well
established
<EOS>
a
woman
's
principles
may
be
she
can
not
always
keep
on
her
guard
against
the
temptation
to
exercise
an
idle
curiosity
.
<EOS>
I
am
ashamed
to
say
that
an
idle
curiosity
,
on
this
occasion
,
got
the
better
of
my
principles
,
and
made
me
unduly
inquisitive
about
the
question
which
Sir
Percival
had
addressed
to
his
noble
friend
at
the
library
door
.
<EOS>
Who
was
the
Count
expected
to
find
in
the
course
of
his
studious
morning
rambles
at
Blackwater
Park
?
<EOS>
A
woman
,
it
was
to
be
presumed
,
from
the
terms
of
Sir
Percival
's
inquiry
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
suspect
the
Count
of
any
impropriety
 
<EOS>
I
knew
his
moral
character
too
well
.
<EOS>
The
only
question
I
asked
myself
was
 
<EOS>
Had
he
found
her
?
  
<EOS>
To
resume
.
<EOS>
The
night
passed
as
usual
without
producing
any
change
for
the
better
in
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
The
next
day
she
seemed
to
improve
a
little
.
<EOS>
The
day
after
that
her
ladyship
the
Countess
,
without
mentioning
the
object
of
her
journey
to
any
one
in
my
hearing
,
proceeded
by
the
morning
train
to
London
 
<EOS>
her
noble
husband
,
with
his
customary
attention
,
accompanying
her
to
the
station
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
now
left
in
sole
charge
of
Miss
Halcombe
,
with
every
apparent
chance
,
in
consequence
of
her
sister
's
resolution
not
to
leave
the
bedside
,
of
having
Lady
Glyde
herself
to
nurse
next
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
circumstance
of
any
importance
that
happened
in
the
course
of
the
day
was
the
occurrence
of
another
unpleasant
meeting
between
the
doctor
and
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
,
on
returning
from
the
station
,
stepped
up
into
Miss
Halcombe
's
sitting
-
room
to
make
his
inquiries
.
<EOS>
I
went
out
from
the
bedroom
to
speak
to
him
,
Mr.
Dawson
and
Lady
Glyde
being
both
with
the
patient
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
The
Count
asked
me
many
questions
about
the
treatment
and
the
symptoms
.
<EOS>
I
informed
him
that
the
treatment
was
of
the
kind
described
as
"
saline
,
"
and
that
the
symptoms
,
between
the
attacks
of
fever
,
were
certainly
those
of
increasing
weakness
and
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
Just
as
I
was
mentioning
these
last
particulars
,
Mr.
Dawson
came
out
from
the
bedroom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
morning
,
sir
,
"
said
his
lordship
,
stepping
forward
in
the
most
urbane
manner
,
and
stopping
the
doctor
,
with
a
high
-
bred
resolution
impossible
to
resist
,
"
I
greatly
fear
you
find
no
improvement
in
the
symptoms
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
find
decided
improvement
,
"
answered
Mr.
Dawson
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
still
persist
in
your
lowering
treatment
of
this
case
of
fever
?
"
continued
his
lordship
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
persist
in
the
treatment
which
is
justified
by
my
own
professional
experience
,
"
said
Mr.
Dawson
.
  
<EOS>
"
Permit
me
to
put
one
question
to
you
on
the
vast
subject
of
professional
experience
,
"
observed
the
Count
.
<EOS>
"
I
presume
to
offer
no
more
advice
 
<EOS>
I
only
presume
to
make
an
inquiry
.
<EOS>
You
live
at
some
distance
,
sir
,
from
the
gigantic
centres
of
scientific
activity
 
London
and
Paris
.
<EOS>
Have
you
ever
heard
of
the
wasting
effects
of
fever
being
reasonably
and
intelligibly
repaired
by
fortifying
the
exhausted
patient
with
brandy
,
wine
,
ammonia
,
and
quinine
?
<EOS>
Has
that
new
heresy
of
the
highest
medical
authorities
ever
reached
your
ears
 
<EOS>
Yes
or
No
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
a
professional
man
puts
that
question
to
me
I
shall
be
glad
to
answer
him
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
opening
the
door
to
go
out
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
a
professional
man
,
and
I
beg
to
decline
answering
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Buffeted
in
this
inexcusably
uncivil
way
on
one
cheek
,
the
Count
,
like
a
practical
Christian
,
immediately
turned
the
other
,
and
said
,
in
the
sweetest
manner
,
"
Good
-
morning
,
Mr.
Dawson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
my
late
beloved
husband
had
been
so
fortunate
as
to
know
his
lordship
,
how
highly
he
and
the
Count
would
have
esteemed
each
other
!
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
the
Countess
returned
by
the
last
train
that
night
,
and
brought
with
her
the
nurse
from
London
.
<EOS>
I
was
instructed
that
this
person
's
name
was
Mrs.
Rubelle
.
<EOS>
Her
personal
appearance
,
and
her
imperfect
English
when
she
spoke
,
informed
me
that
she
was
a
foreigner
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
always
cultivated
a
feeling
of
humane
indulgence
for
foreigners
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
possess
our
blessings
and
advantages
,
and
they
are
,
for
the
most
part
,
brought
up
in
the
blind
errors
of
Popery
.
<EOS>
It
has
also
always
been
my
precept
and
practice
,
as
it
was
my
dear
husband
's
precept
and
practice
before
me
(
see
Sermon
XXIX
.
<EOS>
in
the
Collection
by
the
late
Rev.
Samuel
Michelson
,
M.A.
)
,
to
do
as
I
would
be
done
by
.
<EOS>
On
both
these
accounts
I
will
not
say
that
Mrs.
Rubelle
struck
me
as
being
a
small
,
wiry
,
sly
person
,
of
fifty
or
thereabouts
,
with
a
dark
brown
or
Creole
complexion
and
watchful
light
grey
eyes
.
<EOS>
Nor
will
I
mention
,
for
the
reasons
just
alleged
,
that
I
thought
her
dress
,
though
it
was
of
the
plainest
black
silk
,
inappropriately
costly
in
texture
and
unnecessarily
refined
in
trimming
and
finish
,
for
a
person
in
her
position
in
life
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
like
these
things
to
be
said
of
me
,
and
therefore
it
is
my
duty
not
to
say
them
of
Mrs.
Rubelle
.
<EOS>
I
will
merely
mention
that
her
manners
were
,
not
perhaps
unpleasantly
reserved
,
but
only
remarkably
quiet
and
retiring
 
that
she
looked
about
her
a
great
deal
,
and
said
very
little
,
which
might
have
arisen
quite
as
much
from
her
own
modesty
as
from
distrust
of
her
position
at
Blackwater
Park
;
and
that
she
declined
to
partake
of
supper
(
which
was
curious
perhaps
,
but
surely
not
suspicious
?
)
,
although
I
myself
politely
invited
her
to
that
meal
in
my
own
room
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
Count
's
particular
suggestion
(
so
like
his
lordship
's
forgiving
kindness
!
)
,
it
was
arranged
that
Mrs.
Rubelle
should
not
enter
on
her
duties
until
she
had
been
seen
and
approved
by
the
doctor
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
I
sat
up
that
night
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
appeared
to
be
very
unwilling
that
the
new
nurse
should
be
employed
to
attend
on
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
Such
want
of
liberality
towards
a
foreigner
on
the
part
of
a
lady
of
her
education
and
refinement
surprised
me
.
<EOS>
I
ventured
to
say
,
"
My
lady
,
we
must
all
remember
not
to
be
hasty
in
our
judgments
on
our
inferiors
 
especially
when
they
come
from
foreign
parts

"
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
did
not
appear
to
attend
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
only
sighed
,
and
kissed
Miss
Halcombe
's
hand
as
it
lay
on
the
counterpane
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
a
judicious
proceeding
in
a
sick
-
room
,
with
a
patient
whom
it
was
highly
desirable
not
to
excite
.
<EOS>
But
poor
Lady
Glyde
knew
nothing
of
nursing
 
<EOS>
nothing
whatever
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
Mrs.
Rubelle
was
sent
to
the
sitting
-
room
,
to
be
approved
by
the
doctor
on
his
way
through
to
the
bedroom
.
  
<EOS>
I
left
Lady
Glyde
with
Miss
Halcombe
,
who
was
slumbering
at
the
time
,
and
joined
Mrs.
Rubelle
,
with
the
object
of
kindly
preventing
her
from
feeling
strange
and
nervous
in
consequence
of
the
uncertainty
of
her
situation
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
appear
to
see
it
in
that
light
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
be
quite
satisfied
,
beforehand
,
that
Mr.
Dawson
would
approve
of
her
,
and
she
sat
calmly
looking
out
of
window
,
with
every
appearance
of
enjoying
the
country
air
.
<EOS>
Some
people
might
have
thought
such
conduct
suggestive
of
brazen
assurance
.
<EOS>
I
beg
to
say
that
I
more
liberally
set
it
down
to
extraordinary
strength
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
Instead
of
the
doctor
coming
up
to
us
,
I
was
sent
for
to
see
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
I
thought
this
change
of
affairs
rather
odd
,
but
Mrs.
Rubelle
did
not
appear
to
be
affected
by
it
in
any
way
.
<EOS>
I
left
her
still
calmly
looking
out
of
the
window
,
and
still
silently
enjoying
the
country
air
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
was
waiting
for
me
by
himself
in
the
breakfast
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
About
this
new
nurse
,
Mrs.
Michelson
,
"
said
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
find
that
she
has
been
brought
here
from
London
by
the
wife
of
that
fat
old
foreigner
,
who
is
always
trying
to
interfere
with
me
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Michelson
,
the
fat
old
foreigner
is
a
quack
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
very
rude
.
<EOS>
I
was
naturally
shocked
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
aware
,
sir
,
"
I
said
,
"
that
you
are
talking
of
a
nobleman
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pooh
!
<EOS>
He
is
n't
the
first
quack
with
a
handle
to
his
name
.
<EOS>
They
're
all
Counts
 
<EOS>
hang
'
em
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
would
not
be
a
friend
of
Sir
Percival
Glyde
's
,
sir
,
if
he
was
not
a
member
of
the
highest
aristocracy
 
excepting
the
English
aristocracy
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
Mrs.
Michelson
,
call
him
what
you
like
,
and
let
us
get
back
to
the
nurse
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
objecting
to
her
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Without
having
seen
her
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
without
having
seen
her
.
<EOS>
She
may
be
the
best
nurse
in
existence
,
but
she
is
not
a
nurse
of
my
providing
.
<EOS>
I
have
put
that
objection
to
Sir
Percival
,
as
the
master
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
does
n't
support
me
.
<EOS>
He
says
a
nurse
of
my
providing
would
have
been
a
stranger
from
London
also
,
and
he
thinks
the
woman
ought
to
have
a
trial
,
after
his
wife
's
aunt
has
taken
the
trouble
to
fetch
her
from
London
.
<EOS>
There
is
some
justice
in
that
,
and
I
ca
n't
decently
say
No
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
made
it
a
condition
that
she
is
to
go
at
once
,
if
I
find
reason
to
complain
of
her
.
<EOS>
This
proposal
being
one
which
I
have
some
right
to
make
,
as
medical
attendant
,
Sir
Percival
has
consented
to
it
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Mrs.
Michelson
,
I
know
I
can
depend
on
you
,
and
I
want
you
to
keep
a
sharp
eye
on
the
nurse
for
the
first
day
or
two
,
and
to
see
that
she
gives
Miss
Halcombe
no
medicines
but
mine
.
<EOS>
This
foreign
nobleman
of
yours
is
dying
to
try
his
quack
remedies
(
mesmerism
included
)
on
my
patient
,
and
a
nurse
who
is
brought
here
by
his
wife
may
be
a
little
too
willing
to
help
him
.
<EOS>
You
understand
?
<EOS>
Very
well
,
then
,
we
may
go
upstairs
.
<EOS>
Is
the
nurse
there
?
<EOS>
I
'll
say
a
word
to
her
before
she
goes
into
the
sick
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
found
Mrs.
Rubelle
still
enjoying
herself
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
When
I
introduced
her
to
Mr.
Dawson
,
neither
the
doctor
's
doubtful
looks
nor
the
doctor
's
searching
questions
appeared
to
confuse
her
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
She
answered
him
quietly
in
her
broken
English
,
and
though
he
tried
hard
to
puzzle
her
,
she
never
betrayed
the
least
ignorance
,
so
far
,
about
any
part
of
her
duties
.
<EOS>
This
was
doubtless
the
result
of
strength
of
mind
,
as
I
said
before
,
and
not
of
brazen
assurance
,
by
any
means
.
  
<EOS>
We
all
went
into
the
bedroom
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rubelle
looked
very
attentively
at
the
patient
,
curtseyed
to
Lady
Glyde
,
set
one
or
two
little
things
right
in
the
room
,
and
sat
down
quietly
in
a
corner
to
wait
until
she
was
wanted
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
seemed
startled
and
annoyed
by
the
appearance
of
the
strange
nurse
.
<EOS>
No
one
said
anything
,
for
fear
of
rousing
Miss
Halcombe
,
who
was
still
slumbering
,
except
the
doctor
,
who
whispered
a
question
about
the
night
.
<EOS>
I
softly
answered
,
"
Much
as
usual
,
"
and
then
Mr.
Dawson
went
out
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
followed
him
,
I
suppose
to
speak
about
Mrs.
Rubelle
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
had
made
up
my
mind
already
that
this
quiet
foreign
person
would
keep
her
situation
.
<EOS>
She
had
all
her
wits
about
her
,
and
she
certainly
understood
her
business
.
<EOS>
So
far
,
I
could
hardly
have
done
much
better
by
the
bedside
myself
.
  
<EOS>
Remembering
Mr.
Dawson
's
caution
to
me
,
I
subjected
Mrs.
Rubelle
to
a
severe
scrutiny
at
certain
intervals
for
the
next
three
or
four
days
.
<EOS>
I
over
and
over
again
entered
the
room
softly
and
suddenly
,
but
I
never
found
her
out
in
any
suspicious
action
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
,
who
watched
her
as
attentively
as
I
did
,
discovered
nothing
either
.
<EOS>
I
never
detected
a
sign
of
the
medicine
bottles
being
tampered
with
<EOS>
,
I
never
saw
Mrs.
Rubelle
say
a
word
to
the
Count
,
or
the
Count
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
managed
Miss
Halcombe
with
unquestionable
care
and
discretion
.
<EOS>
The
poor
lady
wavered
backwards
and
forwards
between
a
sort
of
sleepy
exhaustion
,
which
was
half
faintness
and
half
slumbering
,
and
attacks
of
fever
which
brought
with
them
more
or
less
of
wandering
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rubelle
never
disturbed
her
in
the
first
case
,
and
never
startled
her
in
the
second
,
by
appearing
too
suddenly
at
the
bedside
in
the
character
of
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
Honour
to
whom
honour
is
due
(
whether
foreign
or
English
)
 
<EOS>
and
I
give
her
privilege
impartially
to
Mrs.
Rubelle
.
<EOS>
She
was
remarkably
uncommunicative
about
herself
,
and
she
was
too
quietly
independent
of
all
advice
from
experienced
persons
who
understood
the
duties
of
a
sick
-
room
 
<EOS>
but
with
these
drawbacks
,
she
was
a
good
nurse
,
and
she
never
gave
either
Lady
Glyde
or
Mr.
Dawson
the
shadow
of
a
reason
for
complaining
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
circumstance
of
importance
that
occurred
in
the
house
was
the
temporary
absence
of
the
Count
,
occasioned
by
business
which
took
him
to
London
.
<EOS>
He
went
away
(
I
think
)
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
after
the
arrival
of
Mrs.
Rubelle
,
and
at
parting
he
spoke
to
Lady
Glyde
very
seriously
,
in
my
presence
,
on
the
subject
of
Miss
Halcombe
.
  
<EOS>
"
Trust
Mr.
Dawson
,
"
he
said
,
"
for
a
few
days
more
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
But
if
there
is
not
some
change
for
the
better
in
that
time
,
send
for
advice
from
London
,
which
this
mule
of
a
doctor
must
accept
in
spite
of
himself
.
<EOS>
Offend
Mr.
Dawson
,
and
save
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
I
say
this
seriously
,
on
my
word
of
honour
and
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
spoke
with
extreme
feeling
and
kindness
.
<EOS>
But
poor
Lady
Glyde
's
nerves
were
so
completely
broken
down
that
she
seemed
quite
frightened
at
him
.
<EOS>
She
trembled
from
head
to
foot
,
and
allowed
him
to
take
his
leave
without
uttering
a
word
on
her
side
.
<EOS>
She
turned
to
me
when
he
had
gone
,
and
said
,
"
Oh
,
Mrs.
Michelson
,
I
am
heartbroken
about
my
sister
,
and
I
have
no
friend
to
advise
me
!
<EOS>
Do
you
think
Mr.
Dawson
is
wrong
?
<EOS>
He
told
me
himself
this
morning
that
there
was
no
fear
,
and
no
need
to
send
for
another
doctor
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
all
respect
to
Mr.
Dawson
,
"
I
answered
,
"
in
your
ladyship
's
place
I
should
remember
the
Count
's
advice
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
turned
away
from
me
suddenly
,
with
an
appearance
of
despair
,
for
which
I
was
quite
unable
to
account
.
  
<EOS>
"
HIS
advice
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
to
herself
.
"
<EOS>
God
help
us
 
HIS
advice
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Count
was
away
from
Blackwater
Park
,
as
nearly
as
I
remember
,
a
week
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
seemed
to
feel
the
loss
of
his
lordship
in
various
ways
,
and
appeared
also
,
I
thought
,
much
depressed
and
altered
by
the
sickness
and
sorrow
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
he
was
so
very
restless
that
I
could
not
help
noticing
it
,
coming
and
going
,
and
wandering
here
and
there
and
everywhere
in
the
grounds
.
<EOS>
His
inquiries
about
Miss
Halcombe
,
and
about
his
lady
(
whose
failing
health
seemed
to
cause
him
sincere
anxiety
)
,
were
most
attentive
.
<EOS>
I
think
his
heart
was
much
softened
.
<EOS>
If
some
kind
clerical
friend
 
some
such
friend
as
he
might
have
found
in
my
late
excellent
husband
 
had
been
near
him
at
this
time
,
cheering
moral
progress
might
have
been
made
with
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
I
seldom
find
myself
mistaken
on
a
point
of
this
sort
,
having
had
experience
to
guide
me
in
my
happy
married
days
.
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
the
Countess
,
who
was
now
the
only
company
for
Sir
Percival
downstairs
,
rather
neglected
him
,
as
I
considered
 
or
,
perhaps
,
it
might
have
been
that
he
neglected
her
.
<EOS>
A
stranger
might
almost
have
supposed
that
they
were
bent
,
now
they
were
left
together
alone
,
on
actually
avoiding
one
another
.
<EOS>
This
,
of
course
,
could
not
be
.
<EOS>
But
it
did
so
happen
,
nevertheless
,
that
the
Countess
made
her
dinner
at
luncheon
-
time
,
and
that
she
always
came
upstairs
towards
evening
,
although
Mrs.
Rubelle
had
taken
the
nursing
duties
entirely
off
her
hands
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
dined
by
himself
,
and
William
(
the
man
out
of
livery
)
make
the
remark
,
in
my
hearing
,
that
his
master
had
put
himself
on
half
rations
of
food
and
on
a
double
allowance
of
drink
.
<EOS>
I
attach
no
importance
to
such
an
insolent
observation
as
this
on
the
part
of
a
servant
.
<EOS>
I
reprobated
it
at
the
time
,
and
I
wish
to
be
understood
as
reprobating
it
once
more
on
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
next
few
days
Miss
Halcombe
did
certainly
seem
to
all
of
us
to
be
mending
a
little
.
<EOS>
Our
faith
in
Mr.
Dawson
revived
.
<EOS>
He
appeared
to
be
very
confident
about
the
case
,
and
he
assured
Lady
Glyde
,
when
she
spoke
to
him
on
the
subject
,
that
he
would
himself
propose
to
send
for
a
physician
the
moment
he
felt
so
much
as
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
crossing
his
own
mind
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
person
among
us
who
did
not
appear
to
be
relieved
by
these
words
was
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
She
said
to
me
privately
,
that
she
could
not
feel
easy
about
Miss
Halcombe
on
Mr.
Dawson
's
authority
,
and
that
she
should
wait
anxiously
for
her
husband
's
opinion
on
his
return
.
<EOS>
That
return
,
his
letters
informed
her
,
would
take
place
in
three
days
'
time
.
<EOS>
The
Count
and
Countess
corresponded
regularly
every
morning
during
his
lordship
's
absence
.
<EOS>
They
were
in
that
respect
,
as
in
all
others
,
a
pattern
to
married
people
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
evening
of
the
third
day
I
noticed
a
change
in
Miss
Halcombe
,
which
caused
me
serious
apprehension
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rubelle
noticed
it
too
.
<EOS>
We
said
nothing
on
the
subject
to
Lady
Glyde
,
who
was
then
lying
asleep
,
completely
overpowered
by
exhaustion
,
on
the
sofa
in
the
sitting
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
did
not
pay
his
evening
visit
till
later
than
usual
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
set
eyes
on
his
patient
I
saw
his
face
alter
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
hide
it
,
but
he
looked
both
confused
and
alarmed
.
<EOS>
A
messenger
was
sent
to
his
residence
for
his
medicine
-
chest
,
disinfecting
preparations
were
used
in
the
room
,
and
a
bed
was
made
up
for
him
in
the
house
by
his
own
directions
.
"
<EOS>
Has
the
fever
turned
to
infection
?
<EOS>
"
I
whispered
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
it
has
,
"
he
answered
;
"
we
shall
know
better
to
-
morrow
morning
.
"
  
<EOS>
By
Mr.
Dawson
's
own
directions
Lady
Glyde
was
kept
in
ignorance
of
this
change
for
the
worse
.
<EOS>
He
himself
absolutely
forbade
her
,
on
account
of
her
health
,
to
join
us
in
the
bedroom
that
night
.
<EOS>
She
tried
to
resist
 
there
was
a
sad
scene
 
<EOS>
but
he
had
his
medical
authority
to
support
him
,
and
he
carried
his
point
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
one
of
the
men
-
servants
was
sent
to
London
at
eleven
o'clock
,
with
a
letter
to
a
physician
in
town
,
and
with
orders
to
bring
the
new
doctor
back
with
him
by
the
earliest
possible
train
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
after
the
messenger
had
gone
the
Count
returned
to
Blackwater
Park
.
  
<EOS>
The
Countess
,
on
her
own
responsibility
,
immediately
brought
him
in
to
see
the
patient
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
impropriety
that
I
could
discover
in
her
taking
this
course
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
was
a
married
man
,
he
was
old
enough
to
be
Miss
Halcombe
's
father
,
and
he
saw
her
in
the
presence
of
a
female
relative
,
Lady
Glyde
's
aunt
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
nevertheless
protested
against
his
presence
in
the
room
,
but
I
could
plainly
remark
the
doctor
was
too
much
alarmed
to
make
any
serious
resistance
on
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
The
poor
suffering
lady
was
past
knowing
any
one
about
her
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
take
her
friends
for
enemies
.
<EOS>
When
the
Count
approached
her
bedside
<EOS>
her
eyes
,
which
had
been
wandering
incessantly
round
and
round
the
room
before
,
settled
on
his
face
with
a
dreadful
stare
of
terror
,
which
I
shall
remember
to
my
dying
day
.
<EOS>
The
Count
sat
down
by
her
,
felt
her
pulse
and
her
temples
,
looked
at
her
very
attentively
,
and
then
turned
round
upon
the
doctor
with
such
an
expression
of
indignation
and
contempt
in
his
face
,
that
the
words
failed
on
Mr.
Dawson
's
lips
,
and
he
stood
for
a
moment
,
pale
with
anger
and
alarm
 
pale
and
perfectly
speechless
.
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
looked
next
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
did
the
change
happen
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
I
told
him
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
Has
Lady
Glyde
been
in
the
room
since
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
replied
that
she
had
not
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
had
absolutely
forbidden
her
to
come
into
the
room
on
the
evening
before
,
and
had
repeated
the
order
again
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
and
Mrs.
Rubelle
been
made
aware
of
the
full
extent
of
the
mischief
?
"
was
his
next
question
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
aware
,
I
answered
,
that
the
malady
was
considered
infectious
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
me
before
I
could
add
anything
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
typhus
fever
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
minute
that
passed
,
while
these
questions
and
answers
were
going
on
,
Mr.
Dawson
recovered
himself
,
and
addressed
the
Count
with
his
customary
firmness
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
NOT
typhus
fever
,
"
he
remarked
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
I
protest
against
this
intrusion
,
sir
.
<EOS>
No
one
has
a
right
to
put
questions
here
but
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
my
duty
to
the
best
of
my
ability
 
"
  
<EOS>
The
Count
interrupted
him
 
not
by
words
,
but
only
by
pointing
to
the
bed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
seemed
to
feel
that
silent
contradiction
to
his
assertion
of
his
own
ability
,
and
to
grow
only
the
more
angry
under
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
I
have
done
my
duty
,
"
he
reiterated
.
<EOS>
"
A
physician
has
been
sent
for
from
London
.
<EOS>
I
will
consult
on
the
nature
of
the
fever
with
him
,
and
with
no
one
else
.
<EOS>
I
insist
on
your
leaving
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
entered
this
room
,
sir
,
in
the
sacred
interests
of
humanity
,
"
said
the
Count
.
"
<EOS>
And
in
the
same
interests
,
if
the
coming
of
the
physician
is
delayed
,
I
will
enter
it
again
.
<EOS>
I
warn
you
once
more
that
the
fever
has
turned
to
typhus
,
and
that
your
treatment
is
responsible
for
this
lamentable
change
.
<EOS>
If
that
unhappy
lady
dies
,
I
will
give
my
testimony
in
a
court
of
justice
that
your
ignorance
and
obstinacy
have
been
the
cause
of
her
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Before
Mr.
Dawson
could
answer
,
before
the
Count
could
leave
us
,
the
door
was
opened
from
the
sitting
-
room
,
and
we
saw
Lady
Glyde
on
the
threshold
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
MUST
and
WILL
come
in
,
"
she
said
,
with
extraordinary
firmness
.
  
<EOS>
Instead
of
stopping
her
,
the
Count
moved
into
the
sitting
-
room
,
and
made
way
for
her
to
go
in
.
<EOS>
On
all
other
occasions
he
was
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
forget
anything
,
but
in
the
surprise
of
the
moment
he
apparently
forgot
the
danger
of
infection
from
typhus
,
and
the
urgent
necessity
of
forcing
Lady
Glyde
to
take
proper
care
of
herself
.
  
<EOS>
To
my
astonishment
Mr.
Dawson
showed
more
presence
of
mind
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
her
ladyship
at
the
first
step
she
took
towards
the
bedside
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sincerely
sorry
,
I
am
sincerely
grieved
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
The
fever
may
,
I
fear
,
be
infectious
.
<EOS>
Until
I
am
certain
that
it
is
not
,
I
entreat
you
to
keep
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
struggled
for
a
moment
,
then
suddenly
dropped
her
arms
and
sank
forward
.
<EOS>
She
had
fainted
.
<EOS>
The
Countess
and
I
took
her
from
the
doctor
and
carried
her
into
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
The
Count
preceded
us
,
and
waited
in
the
passage
till
I
came
out
and
told
him
that
we
had
recovered
her
from
the
swoon
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
back
to
the
doctor
to
tell
him
,
by
Lady
Glyde
's
desire
,
that
she
insisted
on
speaking
to
him
immediately
.
<EOS>
He
withdrew
at
once
to
quiet
her
ladyship
's
agitation
,
and
to
assure
her
of
the
physician
's
arrival
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
.
<EOS>
Those
hours
passed
very
slowly
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
were
together
downstairs
,
and
sent
up
from
time
to
time
to
make
their
inquiries
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
between
five
and
six
o'clock
,
to
our
great
relief
,
the
physician
came
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
a
younger
man
than
Mr.
Dawson
,
very
serious
and
very
decided
.
<EOS>
What
he
thought
of
the
previous
treatment
I
can
not
say
,
but
it
struck
me
as
curious
that
he
put
many
more
questions
to
myself
and
to
Mrs.
Rubelle
than
he
put
to
the
doctor
,
and
that
he
did
not
appear
to
listen
with
much
interest
to
what
Mr.
Dawson
said
,
while
he
was
examining
Mr.
Dawson
's
patient
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
suspect
,
from
what
I
observed
in
this
way
,
that
the
Count
had
been
right
about
the
illness
all
the
way
through
,
and
I
was
naturally
confirmed
in
that
idea
when
Mr.
Dawson
,
after
some
little
delay
,
asked
the
one
important
question
which
the
London
doctor
had
been
sent
for
to
set
at
rest
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
opinion
of
the
fever
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
Typhus
,
"
replied
the
physician
"
Typhus
fever
beyond
all
doubt
.
"
  
That
quiet
foreign
person
,
Mrs.
Rubelle
,
crossed
her
thin
brown
hands
in
front
of
her
,
and
looked
at
me
with
a
very
significant
smile
.
<EOS>
The
Count
himself
could
hardly
have
appeared
more
gratified
if
he
had
been
present
in
the
room
and
had
heard
the
confirmation
of
his
own
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
After
giving
us
some
useful
directions
about
the
management
of
the
patient
,
and
mentioning
that
he
would
come
again
in
five
days
'
time
,
the
physician
withdrew
to
consult
in
private
with
Mr.
Dawson
.
<EOS>
He
would
offer
no
opinion
on
Miss
Halcombe
's
chances
of
recovery
 
<EOS>
he
said
it
was
impossible
at
that
stage
of
the
illness
to
pronounce
one
way
or
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
The
five
days
passed
anxiously
.
  
<EOS>
Countess
Fosco
and
myself
took
it
by
turns
to
relieve
Mrs.
Rubelle
,
Miss
Halcombe
's
condition
growing
worse
and
worse
,
and
requiring
our
utmost
care
and
attention
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
terribly
trying
time
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
(
supported
,
as
Mr.
Dawson
said
,
by
the
constant
strain
of
her
suspense
on
her
sister
's
account
)
rallied
in
the
most
extraordinary
manner
,
and
showed
a
firmness
and
determination
for
which
I
should
myself
never
have
given
her
credit
.
<EOS>
She
insisted
on
coming
into
the
sick
-
room
two
or
three
times
every
day
,
to
look
at
Miss
Halcombe
with
her
own
eyes
,
promising
not
to
go
too
close
to
the
bed
,
if
the
doctor
would
consent
to
her
wishes
so
far
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
very
unwillingly
made
the
concession
required
of
him
 
<EOS>
I
think
he
saw
that
it
was
hopeless
to
dispute
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
came
in
every
day
,
and
she
self
-
denyingly
kept
her
promise
.
<EOS>
I
felt
it
personally
so
distressing
(
as
reminding
me
of
my
own
affliction
during
my
husband
's
last
illness
)
to
see
how
she
suffered
under
these
circumstances
,
that
I
must
beg
not
to
dwell
on
this
part
of
the
subject
any
longer
.
<EOS>
It
is
more
agreeable
to
me
to
mention
that
no
fresh
disputes
took
place
between
Mr.
Dawson
and
the
Count
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
made
all
his
inquiries
by
deputy
,
and
remained
continually
in
company
with
Sir
Percival
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
fifth
day
the
physician
came
again
and
gave
us
a
little
hope
.
<EOS>
He
said
the
tenth
day
from
the
first
appearance
of
the
typhus
would
probably
decide
the
result
of
the
illness
,
and
he
arranged
for
his
third
visit
to
take
place
on
that
date
.
<EOS>
The
interval
passed
as
before
 
except
that
the
Count
went
to
London
again
one
morning
and
returned
at
night
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
tenth
day
it
pleased
a
merciful
Providence
to
relieve
our
household
from
all
further
anxiety
and
alarm
.
<EOS>
The
physician
positively
assured
us
that
Miss
Halcombe
was
out
of
danger
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
wants
no
doctor
now
 
all
she
requires
is
careful
watching
and
nursing
for
some
time
to
come
,
and
that
I
see
she
has
.
<EOS>
"
Those
were
his
own
words
.
<EOS>
That
evening
I
read
my
husband
's
touching
sermon
on
Recovery
from
Sickness
,
with
more
happiness
and
advantage
(
in
a
spiritual
point
of
view
)
than
I
ever
remember
to
have
derived
from
it
before
.
  
<EOS>
The
effect
of
the
good
news
on
poor
Lady
Glyde
was
,
I
grieve
to
say
,
quite
overpowering
.
<EOS>
She
was
too
weak
to
bear
the
violent
reaction
,
and
in
another
day
or
two
she
sank
into
a
state
of
debility
and
depression
which
obliged
her
to
keep
her
room
.
<EOS>
Rest
and
quiet
,
and
change
of
air
afterwards
,
were
the
best
remedies
which
Mr.
Dawson
could
suggest
for
her
benefit
.
<EOS>
It
was
fortunate
that
matters
were
no
worse
,
for
,
on
the
very
day
after
she
took
to
her
room
,
the
Count
and
the
doctor
had
another
disagreement
 
and
this
time
the
dispute
between
them
was
of
so
serious
a
nature
that
Mr.
Dawson
left
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
not
present
at
the
time
,
but
I
understood
that
the
subject
of
dispute
was
the
amount
of
nourishment
which
it
was
necessary
to
give
to
assist
Miss
Halcombe
's
convalescence
after
the
exhaustion
of
the
fever
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
,
now
that
his
patient
was
safe
,
was
less
inclined
than
ever
to
submit
to
unprofessional
interference
,
and
the
Count
(
I
can
not
imagine
why
)
lost
all
the
self
-
control
which
he
had
so
judiciously
preserved
on
former
occasions
,
and
taunted
the
doctor
,
over
and
over
again
,
with
his
mistake
about
the
fever
when
it
changed
to
typhus
.
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
affair
ended
in
Mr.
Dawson
's
appealing
to
Sir
Percival
,
and
threatening
(
now
that
he
could
leave
without
absolute
danger
to
Miss
Halcombe
)
to
withdraw
from
his
attendance
at
Blackwater
Park
if
the
Count
's
interference
was
not
peremptorily
suppressed
from
that
moment
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
's
reply
(
though
not
designedly
uncivil
)
had
only
resulted
in
making
matters
worse
,
and
Mr.
Dawson
had
thereupon
withdrawn
from
the
house
in
a
state
of
extreme
indignation
at
Count
Fosco
's
usage
of
him
,
and
had
sent
in
his
bill
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
now
,
therefore
,
left
without
the
attendance
of
a
medical
man
.
<EOS>
Although
there
was
no
actual
necessity
for
another
doctor
 
nursing
and
watching
being
,
as
the
physician
had
observed
,
all
that
Miss
Halcombe
required
 
I
should
still
,
if
my
authority
had
been
consulted
,
have
obtained
professional
assistance
from
some
other
quarter
,
for
form
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
The
matter
did
not
seem
to
strike
Sir
Percival
in
that
light
.
<EOS>
He
said
it
would
be
time
enough
to
send
for
another
doctor
if
Miss
Halcombe
showed
any
signs
of
a
relapse
.
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
we
had
the
Count
to
consult
in
any
minor
difficulty
,
and
we
need
not
unnecessarily
disturb
our
patient
in
her
present
weak
and
nervous
condition
by
the
presence
of
a
stranger
at
her
bedside
.
<EOS>
There
was
much
that
was
reasonable
,
no
doubt
,
in
these
considerations
,
but
they
left
me
a
little
anxious
nevertheless
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
I
quite
satisfied
in
my
own
mind
of
the
propriety
of
our
concealing
the
doctor
's
absence
as
we
did
from
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
merciful
deception
,
I
admit
 
for
she
was
in
no
state
to
bear
any
fresh
anxieties
.
<EOS>
But
still
it
was
a
deception
,
and
,
as
such
,
to
a
person
of
my
principles
,
at
best
a
doubtful
proceeding
.
  
<EOS>
A
second
perplexing
circumstance
which
happened
on
the
same
day
,
and
which
took
me
completely
by
surprise
,
added
greatly
to
the
sense
of
uneasiness
that
was
now
weighing
on
my
mind
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
sent
for
to
see
Sir
Percival
in
the
library
.
<EOS>
The
Count
,
who
was
with
him
when
I
went
in
,
immediately
rose
and
left
us
alone
together
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
civilly
asked
me
to
take
a
seat
,
and
then
,
to
my
great
astonishment
,
addressed
me
in
these
terms
    
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
,
Mrs.
Michelson
,
about
a
matter
which
I
decided
on
some
time
ago
,
and
which
I
should
have
mentioned
before
,
but
for
the
sickness
and
trouble
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
In
plain
words
,
I
have
reasons
for
wishing
to
break
up
my
establishment
immediately
at
this
place
 
leaving
you
in
charge
,
of
course
,
as
usual
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Lady
Glyde
and
Miss
Halcombe
can
travel
they
must
both
have
change
of
air
.
<EOS>
My
friends
,
Count
Fosco
and
the
Countess
,
will
leave
us
before
that
time
to
live
in
the
neighbourhood
of
London
,
and
I
have
reasons
for
not
opening
the
house
to
any
more
company
,
with
a
view
to
economising
as
carefully
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
blame
you
,
but
my
expenses
here
are
a
great
deal
too
heavy
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
shall
sell
the
horses
,
and
get
rid
of
all
the
servants
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
never
do
things
by
halves
,
as
you
know
,
and
I
mean
to
have
the
house
clear
of
a
pack
of
useless
people
by
this
time
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
listened
to
him
,
perfectly
aghast
with
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
,
Sir
Percival
,
that
I
am
to
dismiss
the
indoor
servants
under
my
charge
without
the
usual
month
's
warning
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
I
do
.
<EOS>
We
may
all
be
out
of
the
house
before
another
month
,
and
I
am
not
going
to
leave
the
servants
here
in
idleness
,
with
no
master
to
wait
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
to
do
the
cooking
,
Sir
Percival
,
while
you
are
still
staying
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Margaret
Porcher
can
roast
and
boil
 
keep
her
.
<EOS>
What
do
I
want
with
a
cook
if
I
do
n't
mean
to
give
any
dinner
-
parties
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
servant
you
have
mentioned
is
the
most
unintelligent
servant
in
the
house
,
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
her
,
I
tell
you
,
and
have
a
woman
in
from
the
village
to
do
the
cleaning
and
go
away
again
.
<EOS>
My
weekly
expenses
must
and
shall
be
lowered
immediately
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
send
for
you
to
make
objections
,
Mrs.
Michelson
 
I
send
for
you
to
carry
out
my
plans
of
economy
.
<EOS>
Dismiss
the
whole
lazy
pack
of
indoor
servants
to
-
morrow
,
except
Porcher
.
<EOS>
She
is
as
strong
as
a
horse
 
<EOS>
and
we
'll
make
her
work
like
a
horse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
excuse
me
for
reminding
you
,
Sir
Percival
,
that
if
the
servants
go
to
-
morrow
they
must
have
a
month
's
wages
in
lieu
of
a
month
's
warning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
them
!
<EOS>
A
month
's
wages
saves
a
month
's
waste
and
gluttony
in
the
servants
'
hall
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
last
remark
conveyed
an
aspersion
of
the
most
offensive
kind
on
my
management
.
<EOS>
I
had
too
much
self
-
respect
to
defend
myself
under
so
gross
an
imputation
.
<EOS>
Christian
consideration
for
the
helpless
position
of
Miss
Halcombe
and
Lady
Glyde
,
and
for
the
serious
inconvenience
which
my
sudden
absence
might
inflict
on
them
,
alone
prevented
me
from
resigning
my
situation
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
I
rose
immediately
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
lowered
me
in
my
own
estimation
to
have
permitted
the
interview
to
continue
a
moment
longer
.
  
<EOS>
"
After
that
last
remark
,
Sir
Percival
,
I
have
nothing
more
to
say
.
<EOS>
Your
directions
shall
be
attended
to
.
<EOS>
"
Pronouncing
those
words
,
I
bowed
my
head
with
the
most
distant
respect
,
and
went
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
the
servants
left
in
a
body
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
himself
dismissed
the
grooms
and
stablemen
,
sending
them
,
with
all
the
horses
but
one
,
to
London
.
<EOS>
Of
the
whole
domestic
establishment
,
indoors
and
out
,
there
now
remained
only
myself
,
Margaret
Porcher
,
and
the
gardener
 
<EOS>
this
last
living
in
his
own
cottage
,
and
being
wanted
to
take
care
of
the
one
horse
that
remained
in
the
stables
.
  
<EOS>
With
the
house
left
in
this
strange
and
lonely
condition
 
with
the
mistress
of
it
ill
in
her
room
 
with
Miss
Halcombe
still
as
helpless
as
a
child
 
and
with
the
doctor
's
attendance
withdrawn
from
us
in
enmity
 
<EOS>
it
was
surely
not
unnatural
that
my
spirits
should
sink
,
and
my
customary
composure
be
very
hard
to
maintain
.
<EOS>
My
mind
was
ill
at
ease
.
<EOS>
I
wished
the
poor
ladies
both
well
again
,
and
I
wished
myself
away
from
Blackwater
Park
.
    
<EOS>
The
next
event
that
occurred
was
of
so
singular
a
nature
that
it
might
have
caused
me
a
feeling
of
superstitious
surprise
,
if
my
mind
had
not
been
fortified
by
principle
against
any
pagan
weakness
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
The
uneasy
sense
of
something
wrong
in
the
family
which
had
made
me
wish
myself
away
from
Blackwater
Park
,
was
actually
followed
,
strange
to
say
,
by
my
departure
from
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
that
my
absence
was
for
a
temporary
period
only
,
but
the
coincidence
was
,
in
my
opinion
,
not
the
less
remarkable
on
that
account
.
  
<EOS>
My
departure
took
place
under
the
following
circumstances
    
A
day
or
two
after
the
servants
all
left
I
was
again
sent
for
to
see
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
The
undeserved
slur
which
he
had
cast
on
my
management
of
the
household
did
not
,
I
am
happy
to
say
,
prevent
me
from
returning
good
for
evil
to
the
best
of
my
ability
,
by
complying
with
his
request
as
readily
and
respectfully
as
ever
.
<EOS>
It
cost
me
a
struggle
with
that
fallen
nature
,
which
we
all
share
in
common
,
before
I
could
suppress
my
feelings
.
<EOS>
Being
accustomed
to
self
-
discipline
,
I
accomplished
the
sacrifice
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
Sir
Percival
and
Count
Fosco
sitting
together
again
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
his
lordship
remained
present
at
the
interview
,
and
assisted
in
the
development
of
Sir
Percival
's
views
.
  
<EOS>
The
subject
to
which
they
now
requested
my
attention
related
to
the
healthy
change
of
air
by
which
we
all
hoped
that
Miss
Halcombe
and
Lady
Glyde
might
soon
be
enabled
to
profit
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
mentioned
that
both
the
ladies
would
probably
pass
the
autumn
(
by
invitation
of
Frederick
Fairlie
,
Esquire
)
at
Limmeridge
House
,
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
But
before
they
went
there
,
it
was
his
opinion
,
confirmed
by
Count
Fosco
(
who
here
took
up
the
conversation
and
continued
it
to
the
end
)
,
that
they
would
benefit
by
a
short
residence
first
in
the
genial
climate
of
Torquay
.
<EOS>
The
great
object
,
therefore
,
was
to
engage
lodgings
at
that
place
,
affording
all
the
comforts
and
advantages
of
which
they
stood
in
need
,
and
the
great
difficulty
was
to
find
an
experienced
person
capable
of
choosing
the
sort
of
residence
which
they
wanted
.
<EOS>
In
this
emergency
the
Count
begged
to
inquire
,
on
Sir
Percival
's
behalf
,
whether
I
would
object
to
give
the
ladies
the
benefit
of
my
assistance
,
by
proceeding
myself
to
Torquay
in
their
interests
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
for
a
person
in
my
situation
to
meet
any
proposal
,
made
in
these
terms
,
with
a
positive
objection
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
only
venture
to
represent
the
serious
inconvenience
of
my
leaving
Blackwater
Park
in
the
extraordinary
absence
of
all
the
indoor
servants
,
with
the
one
exception
of
Margaret
Porcher
.
<EOS>
But
Sir
Percival
and
his
lordship
declared
that
they
were
both
willing
to
put
up
with
inconvenience
for
the
sake
of
the
invalids
.
<EOS>
I
next
respectfully
suggested
writing
to
an
agent
at
Torquay
,
but
I
was
met
here
by
being
reminded
of
the
imprudence
of
taking
lodgings
without
first
seeing
them
.
<EOS>
I
was
also
informed
that
the
Countess
(
who
would
otherwise
have
gone
to
Devonshire
herself
)
could
not
,
in
Lady
Glyde
's
present
condition
,
leave
her
niece
,
and
that
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
had
business
to
transact
together
which
would
oblige
them
to
remain
at
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
it
was
clearly
shown
me
that
if
I
did
not
undertake
the
errand
,
no
one
else
could
be
trusted
with
it
.
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
,
I
could
only
inform
Sir
Percival
that
my
services
were
at
the
disposal
of
Miss
Halcombe
and
Lady
Glyde
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
thereupon
arranged
that
I
should
leave
the
next
morning
,
that
I
should
occupy
one
or
two
days
in
examining
all
the
most
convenient
houses
in
Torquay
,
and
that
I
should
return
with
my
report
as
soon
as
I
conveniently
could
.
<EOS>
A
memorandum
was
written
for
me
by
his
lordship
,
stating
the
requisites
which
the
place
I
was
sent
to
take
must
be
found
to
possess
,
and
a
note
of
the
pecuniary
limit
assigned
to
me
was
added
by
Sir
Percival
.
  
<EOS>
My
own
idea
on
reading
over
these
instructions
was
,
that
no
such
residence
as
I
saw
described
could
be
found
at
any
watering
-
place
in
England
,
and
that
,
even
if
it
could
by
chance
be
discovered
,
it
would
certainly
not
be
parted
with
for
any
period
on
such
terms
as
I
was
permitted
to
offer
.
<EOS>
I
hinted
at
these
difficulties
to
both
the
gentlemen
,
but
Sir
Percival
(
who
undertook
to
answer
me
)
did
not
appear
to
feel
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
for
me
to
dispute
the
question
.
<EOS>
I
said
no
more
,
but
I
felt
a
very
strong
conviction
that
the
business
on
which
I
was
sent
away
was
so
beset
by
difficulties
that
my
errand
was
almost
hopeless
at
starting
.
  
<EOS>
Before
I
left
I
took
care
to
satisfy
myself
that
Miss
Halcombe
was
going
on
favourably
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
painful
expression
of
anxiety
in
her
face
which
made
me
fear
that
her
mind
,
on
first
recovering
itself
,
was
not
at
ease
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
certainly
strengthening
more
rapidly
than
I
could
have
ventured
to
anticipate
,
and
she
was
able
to
send
kind
messages
to
Lady
Glyde
,
saying
that
she
was
fast
getting
well
,
and
entreating
her
ladyship
not
to
exert
herself
again
too
soon
.
<EOS>
I
left
her
in
charge
of
Mrs.
Rubelle
,
who
was
still
as
quietly
independent
of
every
one
else
in
the
house
as
ever
.
<EOS>
When
I
knocked
at
Lady
Glyde
's
door
before
going
away
,
I
was
told
that
she
was
still
sadly
weak
and
depressed
,
my
informant
being
the
Countess
,
who
was
then
keeping
her
company
in
her
room
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
were
walking
on
the
road
to
the
lodge
as
I
was
driven
by
in
the
chaise
.
<EOS>
I
bowed
to
them
and
quitted
the
house
,
with
not
a
living
soul
left
in
the
servants
'
offices
but
Margaret
Porcher
.
  
<EOS>
Every
one
must
feel
what
I
have
felt
myself
since
that
time
,
that
these
circumstances
were
more
than
unusual
 
<EOS>
they
were
!
<EOS>
almost
suspicious
.
<EOS>
Let
me
,
however
,
say
again
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
,
in
my
dependent
position
,
to
act
otherwise
than
I
did
.
  
<EOS>
The
result
of
my
errand
at
Torquay
was
exactly
what
I
had
foreseen
.
<EOS>
No
such
lodgings
as
I
was
instructed
to
take
could
be
found
in
the
whole
place
,
and
the
terms
I
was
permitted
to
give
were
much
too
low
for
the
purpose
,
even
if
I
had
been
able
to
discover
what
I
wanted
.
<EOS>
I
accordingly
returned
to
Blackwater
Park
,
and
informed
Sir
Percival
,
who
met
me
at
the
door
,
that
my
journey
had
been
taken
in
vain
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
too
much
occupied
with
some
other
subject
to
care
about
the
failure
of
my
errand
,
and
his
first
words
informed
me
that
even
in
the
short
time
of
my
absence
another
remarkable
change
had
taken
place
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
The
Count
and
Countess
Fosco
had
left
Blackwater
Park
for
their
new
residence
in
St.
John
's
Wood
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
not
made
aware
of
the
motive
for
this
sudden
departure
 
<EOS>
I
was
only
told
that
the
Count
had
been
very
particular
in
leaving
his
kind
compliments
to
me
.
<EOS>
When
I
ventured
on
asking
Sir
Percival
whether
Lady
Glyde
had
any
one
to
attend
to
her
comforts
in
the
absence
of
the
Countess
,
he
replied
that
she
had
Margaret
Porcher
to
wait
on
her
,
and
he
added
that
a
woman
from
the
village
had
been
sent
for
to
do
the
work
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
The
answer
really
shocked
me
 
<EOS>
there
was
such
a
glaring
impropriety
in
permitting
an
under
-
housemaid
to
fill
the
place
of
confidential
attendant
on
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
I
went
upstairs
at
once
,
and
met
Margaret
on
the
bedroom
landing
.
<EOS>
Her
services
had
not
been
required
(
naturally
enough
)
,
her
mistress
having
sufficiently
recovered
that
morning
to
be
able
to
leave
her
bed
.
<EOS>
I
asked
next
after
Miss
Halcombe
,
but
I
was
answered
in
a
slouching
,
sulky
way
,
which
left
me
no
wiser
than
I
was
before
.
  
<EOS>
I
did
not
choose
to
repeat
the
question
,
and
perhaps
provoke
an
impertinent
reply
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
every
respect
more
becoming
to
a
person
in
my
position
to
present
myself
immediately
in
Lady
Glyde
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
that
her
ladyship
had
certainly
gained
in
health
during
the
last
few
days
.
<EOS>
Although
still
sadly
weak
and
nervous
,
she
was
able
to
get
up
without
assistance
,
and
to
walk
slowly
about
her
room
,
feeling
no
worse
effect
from
the
exertion
than
a
slight
sensation
of
fatigue
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
made
a
little
anxious
that
morning
about
Miss
Halcombe
,
through
having
received
no
news
of
her
from
any
one
.
<EOS>
I
thought
this
seemed
to
imply
a
blamable
want
of
attention
on
the
part
of
Mrs.
Rubelle
,
but
I
said
nothing
,
and
remained
with
Lady
Glyde
to
assist
her
to
dress
.
<EOS>
When
she
was
ready
we
both
left
the
room
together
to
go
to
Miss
Halcombe
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
stopped
in
the
passage
by
the
appearance
of
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
He
looked
as
if
he
had
been
purposely
waiting
there
to
see
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
going
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
to
Lady
Glyde
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
Marian
's
room
,
"
she
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
spare
you
a
disappointment
,
"
remarked
Sir
Percival
,
"
if
I
tell
you
at
once
that
you
will
not
find
her
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
find
her
there
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
She
left
the
house
yesterday
morning
with
Fosco
and
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
was
not
strong
enough
to
bear
the
surprise
of
this
extraordinary
statement
.
<EOS>
She
turned
fearfully
pale
,
and
leaned
back
against
the
wall
,
looking
at
her
husband
in
dead
silence
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
so
astonished
myself
that
I
hardly
knew
what
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
asked
Sir
Percival
if
he
really
meant
that
Miss
Halcombe
had
left
Blackwater
Park
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
mean
it
,
"
he
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
her
state
,
Sir
Percival
!
<EOS>
Without
mentioning
her
intentions
to
Lady
Glyde
!
"
  
<EOS>
Before
he
could
reply
her
ladyship
recovered
herself
a
little
and
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Impossible
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
out
in
a
loud
,
frightened
manner
,
taking
a
step
or
two
forward
from
the
wall
.
<EOS>
"
Where
was
the
doctor
?
<EOS>
where
was
Mr.
Dawson
when
Marian
went
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Dawson
was
n't
wanted
,
and
was
n't
here
,
"
said
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
left
of
his
own
accord
,
which
is
enough
of
itself
to
show
that
she
was
strong
enough
to
travel
.
<EOS>
How
you
stare
!
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
believe
she
has
gone
,
look
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
Open
her
room
door
,
and
all
the
other
room
doors
if
you
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
took
him
at
his
word
,
and
I
followed
her
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
one
in
Miss
Halcombe
's
room
but
Margaret
Porcher
,
who
was
busy
setting
it
to
rights
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
one
in
the
spare
rooms
or
the
dressing
-
rooms
when
we
looked
into
them
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
still
waited
for
us
in
the
passage
.
<EOS>
As
we
were
leaving
the
last
room
that
we
had
examined
Lady
Glyde
whispered
,
"
Do
n't
go
,
Mrs.
Michelson
!
<EOS>
do
n't
leave
me
,
for
God
's
sake
!
<EOS>
"
Before
I
could
say
anything
in
return
she
was
out
again
in
the
passage
,
speaking
to
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
it
mean
,
Sir
Percival
?
<EOS>
I
insist
 
<EOS>
I
beg
and
pray
you
will
tell
me
what
it
means
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
means
,
"
he
answered
,
"
that
Miss
Halcombe
was
strong
enough
yesterday
morning
to
sit
up
and
be
dressed
,
and
that
she
insisted
on
taking
advantage
of
Fosco
's
going
to
London
to
go
there
too
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
London
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
on
her
way
to
Limmeridge
.
"
  
Lady
Glyde
turned
and
appealed
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
saw
Miss
Halcombe
last
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
plainly
,
Mrs.
Michelson
,
did
you
think
she
looked
fit
to
travel
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
in
MY
opinion
,
your
ladyship
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
,
on
his
side
,
instantly
turned
and
appealed
to
me
also
.
  
<EOS>
"
Before
you
went
away
,
"
he
said
,
"
did
you
,
or
did
you
not
,
tell
the
nurse
that
Miss
Halcombe
looked
much
stronger
and
better
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
made
the
remark
,
Sir
Percival
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
addressed
her
ladyship
again
the
moment
I
offered
that
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Set
one
of
Mrs.
Michelson
's
opinions
fairly
against
the
other
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
try
to
be
reasonable
about
a
perfectly
plain
matter
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
not
been
well
enough
to
be
moved
<EOS>
do
you
think
we
should
any
of
us
have
risked
letting
her
go
?
<EOS>
She
has
got
three
competent
people
to
look
after
her
 
Fosco
and
your
aunt
,
and
Mrs.
Rubelle
,
who
went
away
with
them
expressly
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
They
took
a
whole
carriage
yesterday
,
and
made
a
bed
for
her
on
the
seat
in
case
she
felt
tired
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
,
Fosco
and
Mrs.
Rubelle
go
on
with
her
themselves
to
Cumberland
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
does
Marian
go
to
Limmeridge
and
leave
me
here
by
myself
?
"
said
her
ladyship
,
interrupting
Sir
Percival
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
your
uncle
wo
n't
receive
you
till
he
has
seen
your
sister
first
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
forgotten
the
letter
he
wrote
to
her
at
the
beginning
of
her
illness
?
<EOS>
It
was
shown
to
you
,
you
read
it
yourself
,
and
you
ought
to
remember
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
remember
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
,
why
should
you
be
surprised
at
her
leaving
you
?
<EOS>
You
want
to
be
back
at
Limmeridge
,
and
she
has
gone
there
to
get
your
uncle
's
leave
for
you
on
his
own
terms
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Lady
Glyde
's
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
Marian
never
left
me
before
,
"
she
said
,
"
without
bidding
me
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
have
bid
you
good
-
<EOS>
bye
this
time
,
"
returned
Sir
Percival
,
"
if
she
had
not
been
afraid
of
herself
and
of
you
.
<EOS>
She
knew
you
would
try
to
stop
her
,
she
knew
you
would
distress
her
by
crying
.
<EOS>
Do
you
want
to
make
any
more
objections
?
<EOS>
If
you
do
,
you
must
come
downstairs
and
ask
questions
in
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
These
worries
upset
me
.
<EOS>
I
want
a
glass
of
wine
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
left
us
suddenly
.
  
<EOS>
His
manner
all
through
this
strange
conversation
had
been
very
unlike
what
it
usually
was
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
be
almost
as
nervous
and
fluttered
,
every
now
and
then
,
as
his
lady
herself
.
<EOS>
I
should
never
have
supposed
that
his
health
had
been
so
delicate
,
or
his
composure
so
easy
to
upset
.
  
<EOS>
I
tried
to
prevail
on
Lady
Glyde
to
go
back
to
her
room
,
but
it
was
useless
.
<EOS>
She
stopped
in
the
passage
,
with
the
look
of
a
woman
whose
mind
was
panic
-
stricken
.
  
<EOS>
"
Something
has
happened
to
my
sister
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Remember
,
my
lady
,
what
surprising
energy
there
is
in
Miss
Halcombe
,
"
I
suggested
.
<EOS>
"
She
might
well
make
an
effort
which
other
ladies
in
her
situation
would
be
unfit
for
.
<EOS>
I
hope
and
believe
there
is
nothing
wrong
 
<EOS>
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
follow
Marian
,
"
said
her
ladyship
,
with
the
same
panic
-
stricken
look
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
where
she
has
gone
,
I
must
see
that
she
is
alive
and
well
with
my
own
eyes
.
<EOS>
Come
!
<EOS>
come
down
with
me
to
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hesitated
,
fearing
that
my
presence
might
be
considered
an
intrusion
.
<EOS>
I
attempted
to
represent
this
to
her
ladyship
,
but
she
was
deaf
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
held
my
arm
fast
enough
to
force
me
to
go
downstairs
with
her
,
and
she
still
clung
to
me
with
all
the
little
strength
she
had
at
the
moment
when
I
opened
the
dining
-
room
door
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
was
sitting
at
the
table
with
a
decanter
of
wine
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
raised
the
glass
to
his
lips
as
we
went
in
and
drained
it
at
a
draught
.
<EOS>
Seeing
that
he
looked
at
me
angrily
when
he
put
it
down
again
,
I
attempted
to
make
some
apology
for
my
accidental
presence
in
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
suppose
there
are
any
secrets
going
on
here
?
<EOS>
"
he
broke
out
suddenly
;
"
there
are
none
 
<EOS>
there
is
nothing
underhand
,
nothing
kept
from
you
or
from
any
one
.
"
<EOS>
After
speaking
those
strange
words
loudly
and
sternly
,
he
filled
himself
another
glass
of
wine
and
asked
Lady
Glyde
what
she
wanted
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
my
sister
is
fit
to
travel
<EOS>
I
am
fit
to
travel
<EOS>
"
said
her
ladyship
,
with
more
firmness
than
she
had
yet
shown
.
<EOS>
"
I
come
to
beg
you
will
make
allowances
for
my
anxiety
about
Marian
,
and
let
me
follow
her
at
once
by
the
afternoon
train
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
wait
till
to
-
morrow
,
"
replied
Sir
Percival
,
"
and
then
if
you
do
n't
hear
to
the
contrary
you
can
go
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
you
are
at
all
likely
to
hear
to
the
contrary
,
so
I
shall
write
to
Fosco
by
to
-
night
's
post
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
said
those
last
words
holding
his
glass
up
to
the
light
,
and
looking
at
the
wine
in
it
instead
of
at
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
Indeed
he
never
once
looked
at
her
throughout
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
Such
a
singular
want
of
good
breeding
in
a
gentleman
of
his
rank
impressed
me
<EOS>
,
I
own
,
very
painfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
write
to
Count
Fosco
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
in
extreme
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
tell
him
to
expect
you
by
the
midday
train
,
"
said
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
"
He
will
meet
you
at
the
station
when
you
get
to
London
,
and
take
you
on
to
sleep
at
your
aunt
's
in
St.
John
's
Wood
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
's
hand
began
to
tremble
violently
round
my
arm
 
<EOS>
why
I
could
not
imagine
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
necessity
for
Count
Fosco
to
meet
me
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
not
stay
in
London
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
take
the
whole
journey
to
Cumberland
in
one
day
.
<EOS>
You
must
rest
a
night
in
London
 
<EOS>
and
I
do
n't
choose
you
to
go
by
yourself
to
an
hotel
.
<EOS>
Fosco
made
the
offer
to
your
uncle
to
give
you
house
-
room
on
the
way
down
,
and
your
uncle
has
accepted
it
.
<EOS>
Here
!
<EOS>
here
is
a
letter
from
him
addressed
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
sent
it
up
this
morning
,
but
I
forgot
.
<EOS>
Read
it
and
see
what
Mr.
Fairlie
himself
says
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
looked
at
the
letter
for
a
moment
and
then
placed
it
in
my
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Read
it
,
"
she
said
faintly
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
read
it
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
note
of
only
four
lines
 
so
short
and
so
careless
that
it
quite
struck
me
.
<EOS>
If
I
remember
correctly
it
contained
no
more
than
these
words
    
"
Dearest
Laura
<EOS>
,
Please
come
whenever
you
like
.
<EOS>
Break
the
journey
by
sleeping
at
your
aunt
's
house
.
<EOS>
Grieved
to
hear
of
dear
Marian
's
illness
.
<EOS>
Affectionately
yours
,
Frederick
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
not
go
there
 
<EOS>
I
would
rather
not
stay
a
night
in
London
,
"
said
her
ladyship
,
breaking
out
eagerly
with
those
words
before
I
had
quite
done
reading
the
note
,
short
as
it
was
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
write
to
Count
Fosco
!
<EOS>
Pray
,
pray
do
n't
write
to
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
filled
another
glass
from
the
decanter
so
awkwardly
that
he
upset
it
and
spilt
all
the
wine
over
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
My
sight
seems
to
be
failing
me
,
"
he
muttered
to
himself
,
in
an
odd
,
muffled
voice
.
<EOS>
He
slowly
set
the
glass
up
again
,
refilled
it
,
and
drained
it
once
more
at
a
draught
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
fear
,
from
his
look
and
manner
,
that
the
wine
was
getting
into
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
write
to
Count
Fosco
,
"
persisted
Lady
Glyde
,
more
earnestly
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
,
I
should
like
to
know
?
"
cried
Sir
Percival
,
with
a
sudden
burst
of
anger
that
startled
us
both
.
<EOS>
"
Where
can
you
stay
more
properly
in
London
than
at
the
place
your
uncle
himself
chooses
for
you
 
at
your
aunt
's
house
?
<EOS>
Ask
Mrs.
Michelson
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
arrangement
proposed
was
so
unquestionably
the
right
and
the
proper
one
,
that
I
could
make
no
possible
objection
to
it
.
<EOS>
Much
as
I
sympathised
with
Lady
Glyde
in
other
respects
,
I
could
not
sympathise
with
her
in
her
unjust
prejudices
against
Count
Fosco
.
<EOS>
I
never
before
met
with
any
lady
of
her
rank
and
station
who
was
so
lamentably
narrow
-
minded
on
the
subject
of
foreigners
.
<EOS>
Neither
her
uncle
's
note
nor
Sir
Percival
's
increasing
impatience
seemed
to
have
the
least
effect
on
her
.
<EOS>
She
still
objected
to
staying
a
night
in
London
,
she
still
implored
her
husband
not
to
write
to
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
"
Drop
it
!
"
said
Sir
Percival
,
rudely
turning
his
back
on
us
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
n't
sense
enough
to
know
what
is
best
for
yourself
other
people
must
know
it
for
you
.
<EOS>
The
arrangement
is
made
and
there
is
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
You
are
only
wanted
to
do
what
Miss
Halcombe
has
done
for
you
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Marian
?
"
repeated
her
Ladyship
,
in
a
bewildered
manner
;
"
Marian
sleeping
in
Count
Fosco
's
house
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
in
Count
Fosco
's
house
.
<EOS>
She
slept
there
last
night
to
break
the
journey
,
and
you
are
to
follow
her
example
,
and
do
what
your
uncle
tells
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
to
sleep
at
Fosco
's
to
-
morrow
night
,
as
your
sister
did
,
to
break
the
journey
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
throw
too
many
obstacles
in
my
way
!
<EOS>
do
n't
make
me
repent
of
letting
you
go
at
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
started
to
his
feet
,
and
suddenly
walked
out
into
the
verandah
through
the
open
glass
doors
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
your
ladyship
excuse
me
,
"
I
whispered
,
"
if
I
suggest
that
we
had
better
not
wait
here
till
Sir
Percival
comes
back
?
<EOS>
I
am
very
much
afraid
he
is
over
-
excited
with
wine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
consented
to
leave
the
room
in
a
weary
,
absent
manner
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
we
were
safe
upstairs
again
,
I
did
all
I
could
to
compose
her
ladyship
's
spirits
.
<EOS>
I
reminded
her
that
Mr.
Fairlie
's
letters
to
Miss
Halcombe
and
to
herself
did
certainly
sanction
,
and
even
render
necessary
,
sooner
or
later
,
the
course
that
had
been
taken
.
<EOS>
She
agreed
to
this
,
and
even
admitted
,
of
her
own
accord
,
that
both
letters
were
strictly
in
character
with
her
uncle
's
peculiar
disposition
 
but
her
fears
about
Miss
Halcombe
,
and
her
unaccountable
dread
of
sleeping
at
the
Count
's
house
in
London
,
still
remained
unshaken
in
spite
of
every
consideration
that
I
could
urge
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
my
duty
to
protest
against
Lady
Glyde
's
unfavourable
opinion
of
his
lordship
,
and
I
did
so
,
with
becoming
forbearance
and
respect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
ladyship
will
pardon
my
freedom
,
"
I
remarked
,
in
conclusion
,
"
but
it
is
said
,
"
by
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
the
Count
's
constant
kindness
and
constant
attention
,
from
the
very
beginning
of
Miss
Halcombe
's
illness
,
merit
our
best
confidence
and
esteem
.
<EOS>
Even
his
lordship
's
serious
misunderstanding
with
Mr.
Dawson
was
entirely
attributable
to
his
anxiety
on
Miss
Halcombe
's
account
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
misunderstanding
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
her
ladyship
,
with
a
look
of
sudden
interest
.
  
<EOS>
I
related
the
unhappy
circumstances
under
which
Mr.
Dawson
had
withdrawn
his
attendance
 
mentioning
them
all
the
more
readily
because
I
disapproved
of
Sir
Percival
's
continuing
to
conceal
what
had
happened
(
as
he
had
done
in
my
presence
)
from
the
knowledge
of
Lady
Glyde
.
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
started
up
,
with
every
appearance
of
being
additionally
agitated
and
alarmed
by
what
I
had
told
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Worse
!
<EOS>
worse
than
I
thought
!
<EOS>
"
she
said
,
walking
about
the
room
,
in
a
bewildered
manner
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Count
knew
Mr.
Dawson
would
never
consent
to
Marian
's
taking
a
journey
 
he
purposely
insulted
the
doctor
to
get
him
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
lady
!
<EOS>
my
lady
!
<EOS>
"
I
remonstrated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Michelson
!
<EOS>
"
she
went
on
vehemently
,
"
no
words
that
ever
were
spoken
will
persuade
me
that
my
sister
is
in
that
man
's
power
and
in
that
man
's
house
with
her
own
consent
.
<EOS>
My
horror
of
him
is
such
,
that
nothing
Sir
Percival
could
say
and
no
letters
my
uncle
could
write
,
would
induce
me
,
if
I
had
only
my
own
feelings
to
consult
,
to
eat
,
drink
,
or
sleep
under
his
roof
.
<EOS>
But
my
misery
of
suspense
about
Marian
gives
me
the
courage
to
follow
her
anywhere
,
to
follow
her
even
into
Count
Fosco
's
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thought
it
right
,
at
this
point
,
to
mention
that
Miss
Halcombe
had
already
gone
on
to
Cumberland
,
according
to
Sir
Percival
's
account
of
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
to
believe
it
!
"
answered
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
she
is
still
in
that
man
's
house
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
wrong
,
if
she
has
really
gone
on
to
Limmeridge
,
I
am
resolved
I
will
not
sleep
to
-
morrow
night
under
Count
Fosco
's
roof
.
<EOS>
My
dearest
friend
in
the
world
,
next
to
my
sister
,
lives
near
London
.
<EOS>
You
have
heard
me
,
you
have
heard
Miss
Halcombe
,
speak
of
Mrs.
Vesey
?
<EOS>
I
mean
to
write
,
and
propose
to
sleep
at
her
house
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
I
shall
get
there
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
I
shall
avoid
the
Count
 
<EOS>
but
to
that
refuge
I
will
escape
in
some
way
,
if
my
sister
has
gone
to
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
All
I
ask
of
you
to
do
,
is
to
see
yourself
that
my
letter
to
Mrs.
Vesey
goes
to
London
to
-
night
,
as
certainly
as
Sir
Percival
's
letter
goes
to
Count
Fosco
.
<EOS>
I
have
reasons
for
not
trusting
the
post
-
bag
downstairs
.
<EOS>
Will
you
keep
my
secret
,
and
help
me
in
this
?
<EOS>
it
is
the
last
favour
,
perhaps
,
that
I
shall
ever
ask
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hesitated
<EOS>
,
I
thought
it
all
very
strange
,
I
almost
feared
that
her
ladyship
's
mind
had
been
a
little
affected
by
recent
anxiety
and
suffering
.
<EOS>
At
my
own
risk
,
however
,
I
ended
by
giving
my
consent
.
<EOS>
If
the
letter
had
been
addressed
to
a
stranger
,
or
to
any
one
but
a
lady
so
well
known
to
me
by
report
as
Mrs.
Vesey
,
I
might
have
refused
.
<EOS>
I
thank
God
 
looking
to
what
happened
afterwards
 
<EOS>
I
thank
God
<EOS>
I
never
thwarted
that
wish
,
or
any
other
,
which
Lady
Glyde
expressed
to
me
,
on
the
last
day
of
her
residence
at
Blackwater
Park
.
  
<EOS>
The
letter
was
written
and
given
into
my
hands
.
<EOS>
I
myself
put
it
into
the
post
-
box
in
the
village
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
We
saw
nothing
more
of
Sir
Percival
for
the
rest
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
slept
,
by
Lady
Glyde
's
own
desire
,
in
the
next
room
to
hers
,
with
the
door
open
between
us
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
so
strange
and
dreadful
in
the
loneliness
and
emptiness
of
the
house
,
that
I
was
glad
,
on
my
side
,
to
have
a
companion
near
me
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
sat
up
late
,
reading
letters
and
burning
them
,
and
emptying
her
drawers
and
cabinets
of
little
things
she
prized
,
as
if
she
never
expected
to
return
to
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
Her
sleep
was
sadly
disturbed
when
she
at
last
went
to
bed
 
<EOS>
she
cried
out
in
it
several
times
,
once
so
loud
that
she
woke
herself
.
<EOS>
Whatever
her
dreams
were
,
she
did
not
think
fit
to
communicate
them
to
me
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
in
my
situation
,
I
had
no
right
to
expect
that
she
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
It
matters
little
now
.
<EOS>
I
was
sorry
for
her
,
I
was
indeed
heartily
sorry
for
her
all
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
was
fine
and
sunny
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
came
up
,
after
breakfast
,
to
tell
us
that
the
chaise
would
be
at
the
door
at
a
quarter
to
twelve
 
<EOS>
the
train
to
London
stopping
at
our
station
at
twenty
minutes
after
.
<EOS>
He
informed
Lady
Glyde
that
he
was
obliged
to
go
out
,
but
added
that
he
hoped
to
be
back
before
she
left
.
<EOS>
If
any
unforeseen
accident
delayed
him
,
I
was
to
accompany
her
to
the
station
,
and
to
take
special
care
that
she
was
in
time
for
the
train
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
communicated
these
directions
very
hastily
 
walking
here
<EOS>
and
there
about
the
room
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
looked
attentively
after
him
wherever
he
went
.
<EOS>
He
never
once
looked
at
her
in
return
.
  
<EOS>
She
only
spoke
when
he
had
done
,
and
then
she
stopped
him
as
he
approached
the
door
,
by
holding
out
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
see
you
no
more
,
"
she
said
,
in
a
very
marked
manner
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
our
parting
 
our
parting
,
it
may
be
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Will
you
try
to
forgive
me
,
Percival
,
as
heartily
as
I
forgive
YOU
?
"
  
<EOS>
His
face
turned
of
an
awful
whiteness
all
over
,
and
great
beads
of
perspiration
broke
out
on
his
bald
forehead
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
come
back
,
"
he
said
,
and
made
for
the
door
,
as
hastily
as
if
his
wife
's
farewell
words
had
frightened
him
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
never
liked
Sir
Percival
,
but
the
manner
in
which
he
left
Lady
Glyde
made
me
feel
ashamed
of
having
eaten
his
bread
and
lived
in
his
service
.
<EOS>
I
thought
of
saying
a
few
comforting
and
Christian
words
to
the
poor
lady
,
but
there
was
something
in
her
face
,
as
she
looked
after
her
husband
when
the
door
closed
on
him
,
that
made
me
alter
my
mind
and
keep
silence
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
time
named
the
chaise
drew
up
at
the
gates
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
was
right
 
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
never
came
back
.
<EOS>
I
waited
for
him
till
the
last
moment
,
and
waited
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
No
positive
responsibility
lay
on
my
shoulders
,
and
yet
I
did
not
feel
easy
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
of
your
own
free
will
,
"
I
said
,
as
the
chaise
drove
through
the
lodge
-
gates
,
"
that
your
ladyship
goes
to
London
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
anywhere
,
"
she
answered
,
"
to
end
the
dreadful
suspense
that
I
am
suffering
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
made
me
feel
almost
as
anxious
and
as
uncertain
about
Miss
Halcombe
as
she
felt
herself
.
<EOS>
I
presumed
to
ask
her
to
write
me
a
line
,
if
all
went
well
in
London
.
<EOS>
She
answered
,
"
Most
willingly
,
Mrs.
Michelson
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
all
have
our
crosses
to
bear
,
my
lady
,
"
I
said
,
seeing
her
silent
and
thoughtful
,
after
she
had
promised
to
write
.
  
<EOS>
She
made
no
reply
 
<EOS>
she
seemed
to
be
too
much
wrapped
up
in
her
own
thoughts
to
attend
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
your
ladyship
rested
badly
last
night
,
"
I
remarked
,
after
waiting
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
was
terribly
disturbed
by
dreams
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
my
lady
?
<EOS>
"
I
thought
she
was
going
to
tell
me
her
dreams
,
but
no
,
when
she
spoke
next
it
was
only
to
ask
a
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
posted
the
letter
to
Mrs.
Vesey
with
your
own
hands
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Did
Sir
Percival
say
,
yesterday
,
that
Count
Fosco
was
to
meet
me
at
the
terminus
in
London
?
"
  
"
He
did
,
my
lady
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
sighed
heavily
when
I
answered
that
last
question
,
and
said
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
We
arrived
at
the
station
,
with
hardly
two
minutes
to
spare
.
<EOS>
The
gardener
(
who
had
driven
us
)
managed
about
the
luggage
,
while
I
took
the
ticket
.
<EOS>
The
whistle
of
the
train
was
sounding
when
I
joined
her
ladyship
on
the
platform
.
<EOS>
She
looked
very
strangely
,
and
pressed
her
hand
over
her
heart
,
as
if
some
sudden
pain
or
fright
had
overcome
her
at
that
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
were
going
with
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
catching
eagerly
at
my
arm
when
I
gave
her
the
ticket
.
  
<EOS>
If
there
had
been
time
,
if
I
had
felt
the
day
before
as
I
felt
then
,
I
would
have
made
my
arrangements
to
accompany
her
,
even
though
the
doing
so
had
obliged
me
to
give
Sir
Percival
warning
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
her
wishes
,
expressed
at
the
last
moment
only
,
were
expressed
too
late
for
me
to
comply
with
them
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
understand
this
herself
before
I
could
explain
it
,
and
did
not
repeat
her
desire
to
have
me
for
a
travelling
companion
.
<EOS>
The
train
drew
up
at
the
platform
.
<EOS>
She
gave
the
gardener
a
present
for
his
children
,
and
took
my
hand
,
in
her
simple
hearty
manner
,
before
she
got
into
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
very
kind
to
me
and
to
my
sister
,
"
she
said
 
"
kind
when
we
were
both
friendless
.
<EOS>
I
shall
remember
you
gratefully
,
as
long
as
I
live
to
remember
any
one
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
 
<EOS>
and
God
bless
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
spoke
those
words
with
a
tone
and
a
look
which
brought
the
tears
into
my
eyes
 
<EOS>
she
spoke
them
as
if
she
was
bidding
me
farewell
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
my
lady
,
"
I
said
,
putting
her
into
the
carriage
,
and
trying
to
cheer
her
;
"
good
-
bye
,
for
the
present
only
;
good
-
bye
,
with
my
best
and
kindest
wishes
for
happier
times
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
,
and
shuddered
as
she
settled
herself
in
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
The
guard
closed
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
believe
in
dreams
?
<EOS>
"
she
whispered
to
me
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
"
My
dreams
,
last
night
,
were
dreams
I
have
never
had
before
.
<EOS>
The
terror
of
them
is
hanging
over
me
still
.
<EOS>
"
The
whistle
sounded
before
I
could
answer
,
and
the
train
moved
.
<EOS>
Her
pale
quiet
face
looked
at
me
for
the
last
time
 
looked
sorrowfully
and
solemnly
from
the
window
.
<EOS>
She
waved
her
hand
,
and
I
saw
her
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
Towards
five
o'clock
on
the
afternoon
of
that
same
day
,
having
a
little
time
to
myself
in
the
midst
of
the
household
duties
which
now
pressed
upon
me
,
I
sat
down
alone
in
my
own
room
,
to
try
and
compose
my
mind
with
the
volume
of
my
husband
's
Sermons
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
in
my
life
I
found
my
attention
wandering
over
those
pious
and
cheering
words
.
<EOS>
Concluding
that
Lady
Glyde
's
departure
must
have
disturbed
me
far
more
seriously
than
I
had
myself
supposed
,
I
put
the
book
aside
,
and
went
out
to
take
a
turn
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
had
not
yet
returned
,
to
my
knowledge
,
so
I
could
feel
no
hesitation
about
showing
myself
in
the
grounds
.
  
<EOS>
On
turning
the
corner
of
the
house
,
and
gaining
a
view
of
the
garden
,
I
was
startled
by
seeing
a
stranger
walking
in
it
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
was
a
woman
 
<EOS>
she
was
lounging
along
the
path
with
her
back
to
me
,
and
was
gathering
the
flowers
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
approached
she
heard
me
,
and
turned
round
.
  
<EOS>
My
blood
curdled
in
my
veins
.
<EOS>
The
strange
woman
in
the
garden
was
Mrs.
Rubelle
!
  
<EOS>
I
could
neither
move
nor
speak
.
<EOS>
She
came
up
to
me
,
as
composedly
as
ever
,
with
her
flowers
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
,
ma'am
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
quietly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
here
!
<EOS>
"
I
gasped
out
.
"
<EOS>
Not
gone
to
London
!
<EOS>
Not
gone
to
Cumberland
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rubelle
smelt
at
her
flowers
with
a
smile
of
malicious
pity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
left
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
summoned
breath
enough
and
courage
enough
for
another
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Miss
Halcombe
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rubelle
fairly
laughed
at
me
this
time
,
and
replied
in
these
words
    
"
Miss
Halcombe
,
ma'am
,
has
not
left
Blackwater
Park
either
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
I
heard
that
astounding
answer
,
all
my
thoughts
were
startled
back
on
the
instant
to
my
parting
with
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
say
I
reproached
myself
,
but
at
that
moment
I
think
I
would
have
given
many
a
year
's
hard
savings
to
have
known
four
hours
earlier
what
I
knew
now
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rubelle
waited
,
quietly
arranging
her
nosegay
,
as
if
she
expected
me
to
say
something
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
thought
of
Lady
Glyde
's
worn
-
out
energies
and
weakly
health
,
and
I
trembled
for
the
time
when
the
shock
of
the
discovery
that
I
had
made
would
fall
on
her
.
<EOS>
For
a
minute
or
more
my
fears
for
the
poor
ladies
silenced
me
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
that
time
Mrs.
Rubelle
looked
up
sideways
from
her
flowers
,
and
said
,
"
Here
is
Sir
Percival
,
ma'am
,
returned
from
his
ride
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
saw
him
as
soon
as
she
did
.
<EOS>
He
came
towards
us
,
slashing
viciously
at
the
flowers
with
his
riding
-
whip
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
near
enough
to
see
my
face
he
stopped
,
struck
at
his
boot
with
the
whip
,
and
burst
out
laughing
,
so
harshly
and
so
violently
that
the
birds
flew
away
,
startled
,
from
the
tree
by
which
he
stood
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mrs.
Michelson
,
"
he
said
,
"
you
have
found
it
out
at
last
,
have
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
made
no
reply
.
<EOS>
He
turned
to
Mrs.
Rubelle
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
did
you
show
yourself
in
the
garden
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
showed
myself
about
half
an
hour
ago
,
sir
.
<EOS>
You
said
I
might
take
my
liberty
again
as
soon
as
Lady
Glyde
had
gone
away
to
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
right
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
blame
you
 
<EOS>
I
only
asked
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
waited
a
moment
,
and
then
addressed
himself
once
more
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
believe
it
,
can
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
mockingly
.
"
<EOS>
Here
!
come
along
and
see
for
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
led
the
way
round
to
the
front
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
followed
him
,
and
Mrs.
Rubelle
followed
me
.
<EOS>
After
passing
through
the
iron
gates
he
stopped
,
and
pointed
with
his
whip
to
the
disused
middle
wing
of
the
building
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Look
up
at
the
first
floor
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
old
Elizabethan
bedrooms
?
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
is
snug
and
safe
in
one
of
the
best
of
them
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
Take
her
in
,
Mrs.
Rubelle
(
you
have
got
your
key
?
)
;
take
Mrs.
Michelson
in
,
and
let
her
own
eyes
satisfy
her
that
there
is
no
deception
this
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
tone
in
which
he
spoke
to
me
,
and
the
minute
or
two
that
had
passed
since
we
left
the
garden
,
helped
me
to
recover
my
spirits
a
little
.
<EOS>
What
I
might
have
done
at
this
critical
moment
,
if
all
my
life
had
been
passed
in
service
,
I
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
possessing
the
feelings
,
the
principles
,
and
the
bringing
up
of
a
lady
,
I
could
not
hesitate
about
the
right
course
to
pursue
.
<EOS>
My
duty
to
myself
,
and
my
duty
to
Lady
Glyde
,
alike
forbade
me
to
remain
in
the
employment
of
a
man
who
had
shamefully
deceived
us
both
by
a
series
of
atrocious
falsehoods
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
beg
permission
,
Sir
Percival
,
to
speak
a
few
words
to
you
in
private
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Having
done
so
,
I
shall
be
ready
to
proceed
with
this
person
to
Miss
Halcombe
's
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rubelle
,
whom
I
had
indicated
by
a
slight
turn
of
my
head
,
insolently
sniffed
at
her
nosegay
and
walked
away
,
with
great
deliberation
,
towards
the
house
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Sir
Percival
sharply
,
"
what
is
it
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
mention
,
sir
,
that
I
am
desirous
of
resigning
the
situation
I
now
hold
at
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
literally
how
I
put
it
.
<EOS>
I
was
resolved
that
the
first
words
spoken
in
his
presence
should
be
words
which
expressed
my
intention
to
leave
his
service
.
  
<EOS>
He
eyed
me
with
one
of
his
blackest
looks
,
and
thrust
his
hands
savagely
into
the
pockets
of
his
riding
-
coat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
,
"
why
,
I
should
like
to
know
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
for
me
,
Sir
Percival
,
to
express
an
opinion
on
what
has
taken
place
in
this
house
.
<EOS>
I
desire
to
give
no
offence
.
<EOS>
I
merely
wish
to
say
that
I
do
not
feel
it
consistent
with
my
duty
to
Lady
Glyde
and
to
myself
to
remain
any
longer
in
your
service
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
consistent
with
your
duty
to
me
to
stand
there
,
casting
suspicion
on
me
to
my
face
?
"
<EOS>
he
broke
out
in
his
most
violent
manner
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
what
you
're
driving
at
.
<EOS>
You
have
taken
your
own
mean
,
underhand
view
of
an
innocent
deception
practised
on
Lady
Glyde
for
her
own
good
.
<EOS>
It
was
essential
to
her
health
that
she
should
have
a
change
of
air
immediately
,
and
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
she
would
never
have
gone
away
if
she
had
been
told
Miss
Halcombe
was
still
left
here
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
deceived
in
her
own
interests
 
<EOS>
and
I
do
n't
care
who
knows
it
.
<EOS>
Go
,
if
you
like
 
there
are
plenty
of
housekeepers
as
good
as
you
to
be
had
for
the
asking
.
<EOS>
Go
when
you
please
 
<EOS>
but
take
care
how
you
spread
scandals
about
me
and
my
affairs
when
you
're
out
of
my
service
.
<EOS>
Tell
the
truth
,
and
nothing
but
the
truth
,
or
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
!
<EOS>
See
Miss
Halcombe
for
yourself
 
<EOS>
see
if
she
has
n't
been
as
well
taken
care
of
in
one
part
of
the
house
as
in
the
other
.
<EOS>
Remember
the
doctor
's
own
orders
that
Lady
Glyde
was
to
have
a
change
of
air
at
the
earliest
possible
opportunity
.
<EOS>
Bear
all
that
well
in
mind
,
and
then
say
anything
against
me
and
my
proceedings
if
you
dare
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
poured
out
these
words
fiercely
,
all
in
a
breath
,
walking
backwards
and
forwards
,
and
striking
about
him
in
the
air
with
his
whip
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
that
he
said
or
did
shook
my
opinion
of
the
disgraceful
series
of
falsehoods
that
he
had
told
in
my
presence
the
day
before
,
or
of
the
cruel
deception
by
which
he
had
separated
Lady
Glyde
from
her
sister
,
and
had
sent
her
uselessly
to
London
,
when
she
was
half
distracted
with
anxiety
on
Miss
Halcombe
's
account
.
<EOS>
I
naturally
kept
these
thoughts
to
myself
,
and
said
nothing
more
to
irritate
him
;
but
I
was
not
the
less
resolved
to
persist
in
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
A
soft
answer
turneth
away
wrath
,
and
<EOS>
I
suppressed
my
own
feelings
accordingly
when
it
was
my
turn
to
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
While
I
am
in
your
service
,
Sir
Percival
<EOS>
,
"
I
said
,
"
I
hope
I
know
my
duty
well
enough
not
to
inquire
into
your
motives
.
<EOS>
When
I
am
out
of
your
service
,
I
hope
I
know
my
own
place
well
enough
not
to
speak
of
matters
which
do
n't
concern
me
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
When
do
you
want
to
go
?
"
he
asked
,
interrupting
me
without
ceremony
.
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
suppose
I
am
anxious
to
keep
you
 
do
n't
suppose
I
care
about
your
leaving
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
am
perfectly
fair
and
open
in
this
matter
,
from
first
to
last
.
<EOS>
When
do
you
want
to
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
wish
to
leave
at
your
earliest
convenience
,
Sir
Percival
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
convenience
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
out
of
the
house
for
good
and
all
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
I
can
settle
your
accounts
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
If
you
want
to
study
anybody
's
convenience
,
it
had
better
be
Miss
Halcombe
's
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rubelle
's
time
is
up
to
-
day
,
and
she
has
reasons
for
wishing
to
be
in
London
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
If
you
go
at
once
,
Miss
Halcombe
wo
n't
have
a
soul
left
here
to
look
after
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hope
it
is
unnecessary
for
me
to
say
that
I
was
quite
incapable
of
deserting
Miss
Halcombe
in
such
an
emergency
as
had
now
befallen
Lady
Glyde
and
herself
.
<EOS>
After
first
distinctly
ascertaining
from
Sir
Percival
that
Mrs.
Rubelle
was
certain
to
leave
at
once
if
I
took
her
place
,
and
after
also
obtaining
permission
to
arrange
for
Mr.
Dawson
's
resuming
his
attendance
on
his
patient
,
I
willingly
consented
to
remain
at
Blackwater
Park
until
Miss
Halcombe
no
longer
required
my
services
.
<EOS>
It
was
settled
that
I
should
give
Sir
Percival
's
solicitor
a
week
's
notice
before
I
left
,
and
that
he
was
to
undertake
the
necessary
arrangements
for
appointing
my
successor
.
<EOS>
The
matter
was
discussed
in
very
few
words
.
<EOS>
At
its
conclusion
Sir
Percival
abruptly
turned
on
his
heel
,
and
left
me
free
to
join
Mrs.
Rubelle
.
<EOS>
That
singular
foreign
person
had
been
sitting
composedly
on
the
door
-
step
all
this
time
,
waiting
till
I
could
follow
her
to
Miss
Halcombe
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
hardly
walked
half
-
way
towards
the
house
when
Sir
Percival
,
who
had
withdrawn
in
the
opposite
direction
,
suddenly
stopped
and
called
me
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
are
you
leaving
my
service
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
The
question
was
so
extraordinary
,
after
what
had
just
passed
between
us
,
that
I
hardly
knew
what
to
say
in
answer
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mind
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
you
are
going
,
"
he
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
give
a
reason
for
leaving
me
,
I
suppose
,
when
you
get
another
situation
.
<EOS>
What
reason
?
<EOS>
The
breaking
up
of
the
family
?
<EOS>
Is
that
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
can
be
no
positive
objection
,
Sir
Percival
,
to
that
reason
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
well
!
<EOS>
That
's
all
I
want
to
know
.
<EOS>
If
people
apply
for
your
character
,
that
's
your
reason
,
stated
by
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
go
in
consequence
of
the
breaking
up
of
the
family
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
turned
away
again
before
I
could
say
another
word
,
and
walked
out
rapidly
into
the
grounds
.
<EOS>
His
manner
was
as
strange
as
his
language
.
<EOS>
I
acknowledge
he
alarmed
me
.
  
<EOS>
Even
the
patience
of
Mrs.
Rubelle
was
getting
exhausted
,
when
I
joined
her
at
the
house
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
last
!
"
she
said
,
with
a
shrug
of
her
lean
foreign
shoulders
.
<EOS>
She
led
the
way
into
the
inhabited
side
of
the
house
,
ascended
the
stairs
,
and
opened
with
her
key
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
,
which
communicated
with
the
old
Elizabethan
rooms
 
a
door
never
previously
used
,
in
my
time
,
at
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
The
rooms
themselves
<EOS>
I
knew
well
,
having
entered
them
myself
on
various
occasions
from
the
other
side
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rubelle
stopped
at
the
third
door
along
the
old
gallery
,
handed
me
the
key
of
it
,
with
the
key
of
the
door
of
communication
,
and
told
me
I
should
find
Miss
Halcombe
in
that
room
.
<EOS>
Before
I
went
in
I
thought
it
desirable
to
make
her
understand
that
her
attendance
had
ceased
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
I
told
her
in
plain
words
that
the
charge
of
the
sick
lady
henceforth
devolved
entirely
on
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mrs.
Rubelle
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
go
very
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
leave
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
to
make
sure
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
that
you
have
taken
charge
,
ma'am
,
I
leave
in
half
an
hour
's
time
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
has
kindly
placed
at
my
disposition
the
gardener
,
and
the
chaise
,
whenever
I
want
them
.
<EOS>
I
shall
want
them
in
half
an
hour
's
time
to
go
to
the
station
.
<EOS>
I
am
packed
up
in
anticipation
already
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
good
-
day
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
dropped
a
brisk
curtsey
,
and
walked
back
along
the
gallery
,
humming
a
little
tune
,
and
keeping
time
to
it
cheerfully
with
the
nosegay
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
I
am
sincerely
thankful
to
say
that
was
the
last
I
saw
of
Mrs.
Rubelle
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
went
into
the
room
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
was
asleep
.
<EOS>
I
looked
at
her
anxiously
,
as
she
lay
in
the
dismal
,
high
,
old
-
fashioned
bed
.
<EOS>
She
was
certainly
not
in
any
respect
altered
for
the
worse
since
I
had
seen
her
last
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
been
neglected
,
I
am
bound
to
admit
,
in
any
way
that
I
could
perceive
.
<EOS>
The
room
was
dreary
,
and
dusty
,
and
dark
,
but
the
window
(
looking
on
a
solitary
court
-
yard
at
the
back
of
the
house
)
was
opened
to
let
in
the
fresh
air
,
and
all
that
could
be
done
to
make
the
place
comfortable
had
been
done
.
<EOS>
The
whole
cruelty
of
Sir
Percival
's
deception
had
fallen
on
poor
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
The
only
ill
-
usage
which
either
he
or
Mrs.
Rubelle
had
inflicted
on
Miss
Halcombe
consisted
,
so
far
as
I
could
see
,
in
the
first
offence
of
hiding
her
away
.
  
<EOS>
I
stole
back
,
leaving
the
sick
lady
still
peacefully
asleep
,
to
give
the
gardener
instructions
about
bringing
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
I
begged
the
man
,
after
he
had
taken
Mrs.
Rubelle
to
the
station
,
to
drive
round
by
Mr.
Dawson
's
,
and
leave
a
message
in
my
name
,
asking
him
to
call
and
see
me
.
<EOS>
I
knew
he
would
come
on
my
account
,
and
I
knew
he
would
remain
when
he
found
Count
Fosco
had
left
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
In
due
course
of
time
the
gardener
returned
,
and
said
that
he
had
driven
round
by
Mr.
Dawson
's
residence
,
after
leaving
Mrs.
Rubelle
at
the
station
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
sent
me
word
that
he
was
poorly
in
health
himself
,
but
that
he
would
call
,
if
possible
,
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Having
delivered
his
message
the
gardener
was
about
to
withdraw
,
but
I
stopped
him
to
request
that
he
would
come
back
before
dark
,
and
sit
up
that
night
,
in
one
of
the
empty
bedrooms
,
so
as
to
be
within
call
in
case
<EOS>
I
wanted
him
.
<EOS>
He
understood
readily
enough
my
unwillingness
to
be
left
alone
all
night
in
the
most
desolate
part
of
that
desolate
house
,
and
we
arranged
that
he
should
come
in
between
eight
and
nine
.
  
<EOS>
He
came
punctually
,
and
I
found
cause
to
be
thankful
that
I
had
adopted
the
precaution
of
calling
him
in
.
<EOS>
Before
midnight
Sir
Percival
's
strange
temper
broke
out
in
the
most
violent
and
most
alarming
manner
,
and
if
the
gardener
had
not
been
on
the
spot
to
pacify
him
on
the
instant
,
I
am
afraid
to
think
what
might
have
happened
.
  
<EOS>
Almost
all
the
afternoon
and
evening
he
had
been
walking
about
the
house
and
grounds
in
an
unsettled
,
excitable
manner
,
having
,
in
all
probability
,
as
I
thought
,
taken
an
excessive
quantity
of
wine
at
his
solitary
dinner
.
<EOS>
However
that
may
be
,
I
heard
his
voice
calling
loudly
and
angrily
in
the
new
wing
of
the
house
,
as
I
was
taking
a
turn
backwards
and
forwards
along
the
gallery
the
last
thing
at
night
.
<EOS>
The
gardener
immediately
ran
down
to
him
,
and
I
closed
the
door
of
communication
,
to
keep
the
alarm
,
if
possible
,
from
reaching
Miss
Halcombe
's
ears
.
<EOS>
It
was
full
half
an
hour
before
the
gardener
came
back
.
<EOS>
He
declared
that
his
master
was
quite
out
of
his
senses
 
not
through
the
excitement
of
drink
,
as
I
had
supposed
,
but
through
a
kind
of
panic
or
frenzy
of
mind
,
for
which
it
was
impossible
to
account
.
<EOS>
He
had
found
Sir
Percival
walking
backwards
and
forwards
by
himself
in
the
hall
,
swearing
,
with
every
appearance
of
the
most
violent
passion
,
that
he
would
not
stop
another
minute
alone
in
such
a
dungeon
as
his
own
house
,
and
that
he
would
take
the
first
stage
of
his
journey
immediately
in
the
middle
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
The
gardener
,
on
approaching
him
,
had
been
hunted
out
,
with
oaths
and
threats
,
to
get
the
horse
and
chaise
ready
instantly
.
<EOS>
In
a
quarter
of
an
hour
Sir
Percival
had
joined
him
in
the
yard
,
had
jumped
into
the
chaise
,
and
,
lashing
the
horse
into
a
gallop
,
had
driven
himself
away
,
with
his
face
as
pale
as
ashes
in
the
moonlight
.
<EOS>
The
gardener
had
heard
him
shouting
and
cursing
at
the
lodge
-
keeper
to
get
up
and
open
the
gate
 
had
heard
the
wheels
roll
furiously
on
again
in
the
still
night
,
when
the
gate
was
unlocked
 
and
knew
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
,
or
a
day
or
two
after
,
I
forget
which
,
the
chaise
was
brought
back
from
Knowlesbury
,
our
nearest
town
,
by
the
ostler
at
the
old
inn
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
had
stopped
there
,
and
had
afterwards
left
by
the
train
 
for
what
destination
the
man
could
not
tell
.
<EOS>
I
never
received
any
further
information
,
either
from
himself
or
from
any
one
else
,
of
Sir
Percival
's
proceedings
,
and
I
am
not
even
aware
,
at
this
moment
,
whether
he
is
in
England
or
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
and
I
have
not
met
since
he
drove
away
like
an
escaped
criminal
from
his
own
house
,
and
it
is
my
fervent
hope
and
prayer
that
we
may
never
meet
again
.
  
<EOS>
My
own
part
of
this
sad
family
story
is
now
drawing
to
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
been
informed
that
the
particulars
of
Miss
Halcombe
's
waking
,
and
of
what
passed
between
us
when
she
found
me
sitting
by
her
bedside
,
are
not
material
to
the
purpose
which
is
to
be
answered
by
the
present
narrative
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
sufficient
for
me
to
say
in
this
place
,
that
she
was
not
herself
conscious
of
the
means
adopted
to
remove
her
from
the
inhabited
to
the
uninhabited
part
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
a
deep
sleep
at
the
time
,
whether
naturally
or
artificially
produced
she
could
not
say
.
<EOS>
In
my
absence
at
Torquay
,
and
in
the
absence
of
all
the
resident
servants
except
Margaret
Porcher
(
who
was
perpetually
eating
,
drinking
,
or
sleeping
,
when
she
was
not
at
work
)
,
the
secret
transfer
of
Miss
Halcombe
from
one
part
of
the
house
to
the
other
was
no
doubt
easily
performed
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rubelle
(
as
I
discovered
for
myself
,
in
looking
about
the
room
)
had
provisions
,
and
all
other
necessaries
,
together
with
the
means
of
heating
water
,
broth
,
and
so
on
,
without
kindling
a
fire
,
placed
at
her
disposal
during
the
few
days
of
her
imprisonment
with
the
sick
lady
.
<EOS>
She
had
declined
to
answer
the
questions
which
Miss
Halcombe
naturally
put
,
but
had
not
,
in
other
respects
,
treated
her
with
unkindness
or
neglect
.
<EOS>
The
disgrace
of
lending
herself
to
a
vile
deception
is
the
only
disgrace
with
which
I
can
conscientiously
charge
Mrs.
Rubelle
.
  
<EOS>
I
need
write
no
particulars
(
and
I
am
relieved
to
know
it
)
of
the
effect
produced
on
Miss
Halcombe
by
the
news
of
Lady
Glyde
's
departure
,
or
by
the
far
more
melancholy
tidings
which
reached
us
only
too
soon
afterwards
at
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
In
both
cases
I
prepared
her
mind
beforehand
as
gently
and
as
carefully
as
possible
,
having
the
doctor
's
advice
to
guide
me
,
in
the
last
case
only
,
through
Mr.
Dawson
's
being
too
unwell
to
come
to
the
house
for
some
days
after
I
had
sent
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
sad
time
,
a
time
which
it
afflicts
me
to
think
of
or
to
write
of
now
.
<EOS>
The
precious
blessings
of
religious
consolation
which
I
endeavoured
to
convey
were
long
in
reaching
Miss
Halcombe
's
heart
,
but
I
hope
and
believe
they
came
home
to
her
at
last
.
<EOS>
I
never
left
her
till
her
strength
was
restored
.
<EOS>
The
train
which
took
me
away
from
that
miserable
house
was
the
train
which
took
her
away
also
.
<EOS>
We
parted
very
mournfully
in
London
.
<EOS>
I
remained
with
a
relative
at
Islington
,
and
she
went
on
to
Mr.
Fairlie
's
house
in
Cumberland
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
only
a
few
lines
more
to
write
before
I
close
this
painful
statement
.
<EOS>
They
are
dictated
by
a
sense
of
duty
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
I
wish
to
record
my
own
personal
conviction
that
no
blame
whatever
,
in
connection
with
the
events
which
I
have
now
related
,
attaches
to
Count
Fosco
.
<EOS>
I
am
informed
that
a
dreadful
suspicion
has
been
raised
,
and
that
some
very
serious
constructions
are
placed
upon
his
lordship
's
conduct
.
<EOS>
My
persuasion
of
the
Count
's
innocence
remains
,
however
,
quite
unshaken
.
<EOS>
If
he
assisted
Sir
Percival
in
sending
me
to
Torquay
,
he
assisted
under
a
delusion
,
for
which
,
as
a
foreigner
and
a
stranger
,
he
was
not
to
blame
.
<EOS>
If
he
was
concerned
in
bringing
Mrs.
Rubelle
to
Blackwater
Park
,
it
was
his
misfortune
and
not
his
fault
,
when
that
foreign
person
was
base
enough
to
assist
a
deception
planned
and
carried
out
by
the
master
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
protest
,
in
the
interests
of
morality
,
against
blame
being
gratuitously
and
wantonly
attached
to
the
proceedings
of
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
second
place
,
I
desire
to
express
my
regret
at
my
own
inability
to
remember
the
precise
day
on
which
Lady
Glyde
left
Blackwater
Park
for
London
.
<EOS>
I
am
told
that
it
is
of
the
last
importance
to
ascertain
the
exact
date
of
that
lamentable
journey
,
and
I
have
anxiously
taxed
my
memory
to
recall
it
.
<EOS>
The
effort
has
been
in
vain
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
remember
now
that
it
was
towards
the
latter
part
of
July
.
<EOS>
We
all
know
the
difficulty
,
after
a
lapse
of
time
,
of
fixing
precisely
on
a
past
date
unless
it
has
been
previously
written
down
.
<EOS>
That
difficulty
is
greatly
increased
in
my
case
by
the
alarming
and
confusing
events
which
took
place
about
the
period
of
Lady
Glyde
's
departure
.
<EOS>
I
heartily
wish
I
had
made
a
memorandum
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
I
heartily
wish
my
memory
of
the
date
was
as
vivid
as
my
memory
of
that
poor
lady
's
face
,
when
it
looked
at
me
sorrowfully
for
the
last
time
from
the
carriage
window
.

<EOS>
THE
NARRATIVE
OF
HESTER
PINHORN
,
COOK
IN
THE
SERVICE
OF
COUNT
<EOS>
FOSCO
  
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
to
say
that
I
have
never
learnt
to
read
or
write
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
a
hard
-
working
woman
all
my
life
,
and
have
kept
a
good
character
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
it
is
a
sin
and
wickedness
to
say
the
thing
which
is
not
,
and
I
will
truly
beware
of
doing
so
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
All
that
I
know
I
will
tell
,
and
I
humbly
beg
the
gentleman
who
takes
this
down
to
put
my
language
right
as
he
goes
on
,
and
to
make
allowances
for
my
being
no
scholar
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
last
summer
I
happened
to
be
out
of
place
(
through
no
fault
of
my
own
)
,
and
I
heard
of
a
situation
as
plain
cook
,
at
Number
Five
,
Forest
Road
,
<EOS>
St.
John
's
Wood
.
<EOS>
I
took
the
place
on
trial
.
<EOS>
My
master
's
name
was
Fosco
.
<EOS>
My
mistress
was
an
English
lady
.
<EOS>
He
was
Count
<EOS>
and
she
was
Countess
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
girl
to
do
housemaid
's
work
when
I
got
there
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
over
-
clean
or
tidy
,
but
there
was
no
harm
in
her
.
<EOS>
I
and
she
were
the
only
servants
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Our
master
and
mistress
came
after
we
got
in
;
and
as
soon
as
they
did
come
we
were
told
,
downstairs
,
that
company
was
expected
from
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
The
company
was
my
mistress
's
niece
,
and
the
back
bedroom
on
the
first
floor
was
got
ready
for
her
.
<EOS>
My
mistress
mentioned
to
me
that
Lady
Glyde
(
that
was
her
name
)
was
in
poor
health
,
and
that
I
must
be
particular
in
my
cooking
accordingly
.
<EOS>
She
was
to
come
that
day
,
as
well
as
I
can
remember
 
but
whatever
you
do
,
do
n't
trust
my
memory
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
to
say
it
's
no
use
asking
me
about
days
of
the
month
,
and
such
-
like
.
<EOS>
Except
Sundays
,
half
my
time
I
take
no
heed
of
them
,
being
a
hard
-
working
woman
and
no
scholar
.
<EOS>
All
I
know
is
Lady
Glyde
came
,
and
when
she
did
come
,
a
fine
fright
she
gave
us
all
surely
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
master
brought
her
to
the
house
,
being
hard
at
work
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
bring
her
in
the
afternoon
,
I
think
,
and
the
housemaid
opened
the
door
to
them
,
and
showed
them
into
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
Before
she
had
been
long
down
in
the
kitchen
again
with
me
,
we
heard
a
hurry
-
skurry
upstairs
,
and
the
parlour
bell
ringing
like
mad
,
and
my
mistress
's
voice
calling
out
for
help
.
  
<EOS>
We
both
ran
up
,
and
there
we
saw
the
lady
laid
on
the
sofa
,
with
her
face
ghastly
white
,
and
her
hands
fast
clenched
,
and
her
head
drawn
down
to
one
side
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
taken
with
a
sudden
fright
,
my
mistress
said
,
and
master
he
told
us
<EOS>
she
was
in
a
fit
of
convulsions
.
<EOS>
I
ran
out
,
knowing
the
neighbourhood
a
little
better
than
the
rest
of
them
,
to
fetch
the
nearest
doctor
's
help
.
<EOS>
The
nearest
help
was
at
Goodricke
's
and
Garth
's
,
who
worked
together
as
partners
,
and
had
a
good
name
and
connection
,
as
I
have
heard
,
all
round
St.
John
's
Wood
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Goodricke
was
in
,
and
he
came
back
with
me
directly
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
some
time
before
he
could
make
himself
of
much
use
.
<EOS>
The
poor
unfortunate
lady
fell
out
of
one
fit
into
another
,
and
went
on
so
till
she
was
quite
wearied
out
,
and
as
helpless
as
a
new
-
born
babe
.
<EOS>
We
then
got
her
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Goodricke
went
away
to
his
house
for
medicine
,
and
came
back
again
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
less
.
<EOS>
Besides
the
medicine
he
brought
a
bit
of
hollow
mahogany
wood
with
him
,
shaped
like
a
kind
of
trumpet
,
and
after
waiting
a
little
while
,
he
put
one
end
over
the
lady
's
heart
and
the
other
to
his
ear
,
and
listened
carefully
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
done
he
says
to
my
mistress
,
who
was
in
the
room
,
"
This
is
a
very
serious
case
,
"
he
says
,
"
I
recommend
you
to
write
to
Lady
Glyde
's
friends
directly
.
<EOS>
"
My
mistress
says
to
him
,
"
Is
it
heart
-
disease
?
"
<EOS>
And
he
says
,
"
Yes
,
heart
-
disease
of
a
most
dangerous
kind
.
"
<EOS>
He
told
her
exactly
what
he
thought
was
the
matter
,
which
I
was
not
clever
enough
to
understand
.
<EOS>
But
I
know
this
,
he
ended
by
saying
that
he
was
afraid
neither
his
help
nor
any
other
doctor
's
help
was
likely
to
be
of
much
service
.
  
<EOS>
My
mistress
took
this
ill
news
more
quietly
than
my
master
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
big
,
fat
,
odd
sort
of
elderly
man
,
who
kept
birds
and
white
mice
,
and
spoke
to
them
as
if
they
were
so
many
Christian
children
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
terribly
cut
up
by
what
had
happened
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
poor
Lady
Glyde
!
<EOS>
poor
dear
Lady
Glyde
!
"
<EOS>
he
says
,
and
went
stalking
about
,
wringing
his
fat
hands
more
like
a
play
-
actor
than
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
For
one
question
my
mistress
asked
the
doctor
about
the
lady
's
chances
of
getting
round
,
he
asked
a
good
fifty
at
least
.
<EOS>
I
declare
he
quite
tormented
us
all
,
and
when
he
was
quiet
at
last
,
out
he
went
into
the
bit
of
back
garden
,
picking
trumpery
little
nosegays
,
and
asking
me
to
take
them
upstairs
and
make
the
sick
-
room
look
pretty
with
them
.
<EOS>
As
if
THAT
did
any
good
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
must
have
been
,
at
times
,
a
little
soft
in
his
head
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
a
bad
master
 
<EOS>
he
had
a
monstrous
civil
tongue
of
his
own
,
and
a
jolly
,
easy
,
coaxing
way
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
liked
him
a
deal
better
than
my
mistress
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
hard
one
,
if
ever
there
was
a
hard
one
yet
.
  
<EOS>
Towards
night
-
time
the
lady
roused
up
a
little
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
so
wearied
out
,
before
that
,
by
the
convulsions
,
that
she
never
stirred
hand
or
foot
,
or
spoke
a
word
to
anybody
.
<EOS>
She
moved
in
the
bed
now
,
and
stared
about
her
at
the
room
and
us
in
it
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
been
a
nice
-
looking
lady
when
well
,
with
light
hair
,
and
blue
eyes
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
Her
rest
was
troubled
at
night
 
at
least
so
I
heard
from
my
mistress
,
who
sat
up
alone
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
only
went
in
once
before
going
to
bed
to
see
if
I
could
be
of
any
use
,
and
then
she
was
talking
to
herself
in
a
confused
,
rambling
manner
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
want
sadly
to
speak
to
somebody
who
was
absent
from
her
somewhere
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
catch
the
name
the
first
time
,
and
the
second
time
master
knocked
at
the
door
,
with
his
regular
mouthful
of
questions
,
and
another
of
his
trumpery
nosegays
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
went
in
early
the
next
morning
,
the
lady
was
clean
worn
out
again
,
and
lay
in
a
kind
of
faint
sleep
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Goodricke
brought
his
partner
,
Mr.
Garth
,
with
him
to
advise
.
<EOS>
They
said
she
must
not
be
disturbed
out
of
her
rest
on
any
account
.
<EOS>
They
asked
my
mistress
many
questions
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
about
what
the
lady
's
health
had
been
in
past
times
,
and
who
had
attended
her
,
and
whether
she
had
ever
suffered
much
and
long
together
under
distress
of
mind
.
<EOS>
I
remember
my
mistress
said
"
Yes
"
to
that
last
question
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Goodricke
looked
at
Mr.
Garth
,
and
shook
his
head
;
and
Mr.
Garth
looked
at
Mr.
Goodricke
,
and
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
They
seemed
to
think
that
the
distress
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
mischief
at
the
lady
's
heart
.
<EOS>
She
was
but
a
frail
thing
to
look
at
,
poor
creature
!
<EOS>
Very
little
strength
at
any
time
<EOS>
,
I
should
say
 
very
little
strength
.
  
<EOS>
Later
on
the
same
morning
,
when
she
woke
,
the
lady
took
a
sudden
turn
,
and
got
seemingly
a
great
deal
better
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
let
in
again
to
see
her
,
no
more
was
the
housemaid
,
for
the
reason
that
she
was
not
to
be
disturbed
by
strangers
.
<EOS>
What
I
heard
of
her
being
better
was
through
my
master
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
wonderful
good
spirits
about
the
change
,
and
looked
in
at
the
kitchen
window
from
the
garden
,
with
his
great
big
curly
-
brimmed
white
hat
on
,
to
go
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
Mrs.
Cook
,
"
says
he
,
"
Lady
Glyde
is
better
.
<EOS>
My
mind
is
more
easy
than
it
was
,
and
I
am
going
out
to
stretch
my
big
legs
with
a
sunny
little
summer
walk
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
order
for
you
,
shall
I
market
for
you
,
Mrs.
Cook
?
<EOS>
What
are
you
making
there
?
<EOS>
A
nice
tart
for
dinner
?
<EOS>
Much
crust
,
if
you
please
 
much
crisp
crust
,
my
dear
,
that
melts
and
crumbles
delicious
in
the
mouth
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
his
way
.
<EOS>
He
was
past
sixty
,
and
fond
of
pastry
.
<EOS>
Just
think
of
that
!
  
<EOS>
The
doctor
came
again
in
the
forenoon
,
and
saw
for
himself
that
Lady
Glyde
had
woke
up
better
.
<EOS>
He
forbid
us
to
talk
to
her
,
or
to
let
her
talk
to
us
,
in
case
she
was
that
way
disposed
,
saying
she
must
be
kept
quiet
before
all
things
,
and
encouraged
to
sleep
as
much
as
possible
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
seem
to
want
to
talk
whenever
I
saw
her
,
except
overnight
,
when
I
could
n't
make
out
what
she
was
saying
 
<EOS>
she
seemed
too
much
worn
down
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Goodricke
was
not
nearly
in
such
good
spirits
about
her
as
master
.
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
when
he
came
downstairs
,
except
that
he
would
call
again
at
five
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
About
that
time
(
which
was
before
master
came
home
again
)
<EOS>
the
bell
rang
hard
from
the
bedroom
,
and
my
mistress
ran
out
into
the
landing
,
and
called
to
me
to
go
for
Mr.
Goodricke
,
and
tell
him
the
lady
had
fainted
.
<EOS>
I
got
on
my
bonnet
and
shawl
,
when
,
as
good
luck
would
have
it
,
the
doctor
himself
came
to
the
house
for
his
promised
visit
.
  
<EOS>
I
let
him
in
,
and
went
upstairs
along
with
him
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
was
just
as
usual
,
"
says
my
mistress
to
him
at
the
door
;
"
she
was
awake
,
and
looking
about
her
in
a
strange
,
forlorn
manner
,
when
I
heard
her
give
a
sort
of
half
cry
,
and
she
fainted
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
The
doctor
went
up
to
the
bed
,
and
stooped
down
over
the
sick
lady
.
<EOS>
He
looked
very
serious
,
all
on
a
sudden
,
at
the
sight
of
her
,
and
put
his
hand
on
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
My
mistress
stared
hard
in
Mr.
Goodricke
's
face
.
<EOS>
"
Not
dead
!
"
says
she
,
whispering
,
and
turning
all
of
a
tremble
from
head
to
foot
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
says
the
doctor
,
very
quiet
and
grave
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dead
.
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
it
would
happen
suddenly
when
I
examined
her
heart
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
My
mistress
stepped
back
from
the
bedside
while
he
was
speaking
,
and
trembled
and
trembled
again
.
"
Dead
!
"
she
whispers
to
herself
;
"
dead
so
suddenly
!
<EOS>
dead
so
soon
!
<EOS>
What
will
the
Count
say
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Goodricke
advised
her
to
go
downstairs
,
and
quiet
herself
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
sitting
up
all
night
,
"
says
he
,
"
and
your
nerves
are
shaken
.
<EOS>
This
person
,
"
says
he
,
meaning
me
,
"
this
person
will
stay
in
the
room
till
I
can
send
for
the
necessary
assistance
.
<EOS>
"
My
mistress
did
as
he
told
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
prepare
the
Count
,
"
she
says
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
carefully
prepare
the
Count
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
she
left
us
,
shaking
from
head
to
foot
,
and
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
master
is
a
foreigner
,
"
says
Mr.
Goodricke
,
when
my
mistress
had
left
us
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Does
he
understand
about
registering
the
death
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
rightly
tell
,
sir
,
"
says
I
,
"
but
I
should
think
not
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
doctor
considered
a
minute
,
and
then
says
he
,
"
I
do
n't
usually
do
such
things
,
"
says
he
,
"
but
it
may
save
the
family
trouble
in
this
case
if
I
register
the
death
myself
.
<EOS>
I
shall
pass
the
district
office
in
half
an
hour
's
time
,
and
I
can
easily
look
in
.
<EOS>
Mention
,
if
you
please
,
that
I
will
do
so
.
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
says
I
,
"
with
thanks
,
I
'm
sure
,
for
your
kindness
in
thinking
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mind
staying
here
till
I
can
send
you
the
proper
person
?
"
says
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
sir
,
"
says
I
;
"
I
'll
stay
with
the
poor
lady
till
then
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
nothing
more
could
be
done
,
sir
,
than
was
done
?
"
says
I.
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
says
he
,
"
nothing
;
she
must
have
suffered
sadly
before
ever
<EOS>
I
saw
her
 
<EOS>
the
case
was
hopeless
when
I
was
called
in
.
"
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
dear
me
!
<EOS>
we
all
come
to
it
,
sooner
or
later
,
do
n't
we
,
sir
?
"
says
I.
He
gave
no
answer
to
that
 
he
did
n't
seem
to
care
about
talking
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
"
Good
-
day
,
"
and
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
I
stopped
by
the
bedside
from
that
time
till
the
time
when
Mr.
Goodricke
sent
the
person
in
,
as
he
had
promised
.
<EOS>
She
was
,
by
name
,
Jane
Gould
.
<EOS>
I
considered
her
to
be
a
respectable
-
looking
woman
.
<EOS>
She
made
no
remark
,
except
to
say
that
she
understood
what
was
wanted
of
her
,
and
that
she
had
winded
a
many
of
them
in
her
time
.
  
<EOS>
How
master
bore
the
news
,
when
he
first
heard
it
,
is
more
than
I
can
tell
,
not
having
been
present
.
<EOS>
When
I
did
see
him
he
looked
<EOS>
awfully
overcome
by
it
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
He
sat
quiet
in
a
corner
,
with
his
fat
hands
hanging
over
his
thick
knees
,
and
his
head
down
,
and
his
eyes
looking
at
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
not
so
much
sorry
,
as
scared
and
dazed
like
,
by
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
My
mistress
managed
all
that
was
to
be
done
about
the
funeral
.
<EOS>
It
must
have
cost
a
sight
of
money
 
<EOS>
the
coffin
,
in
particular
,
being
most
beautiful
.
<EOS>
The
dead
lady
's
husband
was
away
,
as
we
heard
,
in
foreign
parts
.
<EOS>
But
my
mistress
(
being
her
aunt
)
settled
it
with
her
friends
in
the
country
<EOS>
(
Cumberland
,
I
think
)
<EOS>
that
she
should
be
buried
there
,
in
the
same
grave
along
with
her
mother
.
<EOS>
Everything
was
done
handsomely
,
in
respect
of
the
funeral
,
I
say
again
,
and
master
went
down
to
attend
the
burying
in
the
country
himself
.
<EOS>
He
looked
grand
in
his
deep
mourning
,
with
his
big
solemn
face
,
and
his
slow
walk
,
and
his
broad
hatband
 
that
he
did
!
  
<EOS>
In
conclusion
.
<EOS>
I
have
to
say
,
in
answer
to
questions
put
to
me
    
(
1
)
That
neither
I
nor
my
fellow
-
servant
ever
saw
my
master
give
Lady
Glyde
any
medicine
himself
.
  
<EOS>
(

)
<EOS>
That
he
was
never
,
to
my
knowledge
and
belief
,
left
alone
in
the
room
with
Lady
Glyde
.
  
<EOS>
(

)
That
I
am
not
able
to
say
what
caused
the
sudden
fright
,
which
my
mistress
informed
me
had
seized
the
lady
on
her
first
coming
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
cause
was
never
explained
,
either
to
me
or
to
my
fellow
-
servant
.
  
<EOS>
The
above
statement
has
been
read
over
in
my
presence
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
add
to
it
,
or
to
take
away
from
it
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
on
my
oath
as
a
Christian
woman
,
this
is
the
truth
.

THE
NARRATIVE
OF
JANE
GOULD
  
<EOS>
I
was
the
person
sent
in
by
Mr.
Goodricke
to
do
what
was
right
and
needful
by
the
remains
of
a
lady
who
had
died
at
the
house
named
in
the
certificate
which
precedes
this
.
<EOS>
I
found
the
body
in
charge
of
the
servant
,
Hester
Pinhorn
.
<EOS>
I
remained
with
it
,
and
prepared
it
at
the
proper
time
for
the
grave
.
<EOS>
It
was
laid
in
the
coffin
in
my
presence
,
and
I
afterwards
saw
the
coffin
screwed
down
previous
to
its
removal
.
<EOS>
When
that
had
been
done
,
and
not
before
,
I
received
what
was
due
to
me
and
left
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
refer
persons
who
may
wish
to
investigate
my
character
to
Mr.
Goodricke
.
<EOS>
He
will
bear
witness
that
I
can
be
trusted
to
tell
the
truth
.

THE
NARRATIVE
OF
WALTER
HARTRIGHT
  
<EOS>
Early
in
the
summer
of
1850
I
and
my
surviving
companions
left
the
wilds
and
forests
of
Central
America
for
home
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
coast
,
we
took
ship
there
for
England
.
<EOS>
The
vessel
was
wrecked
in
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
 
<EOS>
I
was
among
the
few
saved
from
the
sea
.
<EOS>
It
was
my
third
escape
from
peril
of
death
.
<EOS>
Death
by
disease
,
death
by
the
Indians
,
death
by
drowning
 
all
three
had
approached
me
;
all
three
had
passed
me
by
.
  
<EOS>
The
survivors
of
the
wreck
were
rescued
by
an
American
vessel
bound
for
Liverpool
.
<EOS>
The
ship
reached
her
port
on
the
thirteenth
day
of
October
1850
.
<EOS>
We
landed
late
in
the
afternoon
,
and
I
arrived
in
London
the
same
night
.
  
<EOS>
These
pages
are
not
the
record
of
my
wanderings
and
my
dangers
away
from
home
.
<EOS>
The
motives
which
led
me
from
my
country
and
my
friends
to
a
new
world
of
adventure
and
peril
are
known
.
<EOS>
From
that
self
-
imposed
exile
I
came
back
,
as
I
had
hoped
,
prayed
,
believed
I
should
come
back
 
a
changed
man
.
<EOS>
In
the
waters
of
a
new
life
I
had
tempered
my
nature
afresh
.
<EOS>
In
the
stern
school
of
extremity
and
danger
my
will
had
learnt
to
be
strong
,
my
heart
to
be
resolute
,
my
mind
to
rely
on
itself
.
<EOS>
I
had
gone
out
to
fly
from
my
own
future
.
<EOS>
I
came
back
to
face
it
,
as
a
man
should
.
  
<EOS>
To
face
it
with
that
inevitable
suppression
of
myself
which
I
knew
it
would
demand
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
parted
with
the
worst
bitterness
of
the
past
,
but
not
with
my
heart
's
remembrance
of
the
sorrow
and
the
tenderness
of
that
memorable
time
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
ceased
to
feel
the
one
irreparable
disappointment
of
my
life
 
I
had
only
learnt
to
bear
it
.
<EOS>
Laura
Fairlie
was
in
all
my
thoughts
when
the
ship
bore
me
away
,
and
I
looked
my
last
at
England
.
<EOS>
Laura
Fairlie
was
in
all
my
thoughts
when
the
ship
brought
me
back
,
and
the
morning
light
showed
the
friendly
shore
in
view
.
  
<EOS>
My
pen
traces
the
old
letters
as
my
heart
goes
back
to
the
old
love
.
<EOS>
I
write
of
her
as
Laura
Fairlie
still
.
<EOS>
It
is
hard
to
think
of
her
,
it
is
hard
to
speak
of
her
,
by
her
husband
's
name
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
no
more
words
of
explanation
to
add
on
my
appearance
for
the
second
time
in
these
pages
.
<EOS>
This
narrative
,
if
I
have
the
strength
and
the
courage
to
write
it
,
may
now
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
My
first
anxieties
and
first
hopes
when
the
morning
came
centred
in
my
mother
and
my
sister
.
<EOS>
I
felt
the
necessity
of
preparing
them
for
the
joy
and
surprise
of
my
return
,
after
an
absence
during
which
it
had
been
impossible
for
them
to
receive
any
tidings
of
me
for
months
past
.
<EOS>
Early
in
the
morning
I
sent
a
letter
to
the
Hampstead
Cottage
,
and
followed
it
myself
in
an
hour
's
time
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
first
meeting
was
over
,
when
our
quiet
and
composure
of
other
days
began
gradually
to
return
to
us
,
I
saw
something
in
my
mother
's
face
which
told
me
that
a
secret
oppression
lay
heavy
on
her
heart
.
<EOS>
There
was
more
than
love
 
<EOS>
there
was
sorrow
in
the
anxious
eyes
that
looked
on
me
<EOS>
so
tenderly
 
there
was
pity
in
the
kind
hand
that
slowly
and
fondly
strengthened
its
hold
on
mine
.
<EOS>
We
had
no
concealments
from
each
other
.
<EOS>
She
knew
how
the
hope
of
my
life
had
been
wrecked
 
<EOS>
she
knew
why
I
had
left
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
on
my
lips
to
ask
as
composedly
<EOS>
as
I
could
if
any
letter
had
come
for
me
from
Miss
Halcombe
,
if
there
was
any
news
of
her
sister
that
I
might
hear
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
looked
in
my
mother
's
face
I
lost
courage
to
put
the
question
even
in
that
guarded
form
.
<EOS>
I
could
only
say
,
doubtingly
and
restrainedly
    
"
You
have
something
to
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
sister
,
who
had
been
sitting
opposite
to
us
,
rose
suddenly
without
a
word
of
explanation
 
rose
and
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
My
mother
moved
closer
to
me
on
the
sofa
and
put
her
arms
round
my
neck
.
<EOS>
Those
fond
arms
trembled
 
<EOS>
the
tears
flowed
fast
over
the
faithful
loving
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Walter
!
"
<EOS>
she
whispered
,
"
my
own
darling
!
<EOS>
my
heart
is
heavy
for
you
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
son
!
<EOS>
my
son
!
<EOS>
try
to
remember
that
I
am
still
left
!
"
  
<EOS>
My
head
sank
on
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
She
had
said
all
in
saying
those
words
.
     
<EOS>
It
was
the
morning
of
the
third
day
since
my
return
 
the
morning
of
the
sixteenth
of
October
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
remained
with
them
at
the
cottage
 
I
had
tried
hard
not
to
embitter
the
happiness
of
my
return
to
THEM
as
it
was
embittered
to
ME
.
<EOS>
I
had
done
all
man
could
to
rise
after
the
shock
,
and
accept
my
life
resignedly
 
to
let
my
great
sorrow
come
in
tenderness
to
my
heart
,
and
not
in
despair
.
<EOS>
It
was
useless
and
hopeless
.
<EOS>
No
tears
soothed
my
aching
eyes
,
no
relief
came
to
me
from
my
sister
's
sympathy
or
my
mother
's
love
.
  
<EOS>
On
that
third
morning
I
opened
my
heart
to
them
.
<EOS>
At
last
the
words
passed
my
lips
which
I
had
longed
to
speak
on
the
day
when
my
mother
told
me
of
her
death
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
away
alone
for
a
little
while
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
bear
it
better
when
I
have
looked
once
more
at
the
place
where
I
first
saw
her
 
<EOS>
when
I
have
knelt
and
prayed
by
the
grave
where
they
have
laid
her
to
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
departed
on
my
journey
 
my
journey
to
the
grave
of
Laura
Fairlie
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
quiet
autumn
afternoon
when
I
stopped
at
the
solitary
station
,
and
set
forth
alone
on
foot
by
the
well
-
remembered
road
.
<EOS>
The
waning
sun
was
shining
faintly
through
thin
white
clouds
 
the
air
was
warm
and
still
 
the
peacefulness
of
the
lonely
country
was
overshadowed
and
saddened
by
the
influence
of
the
falling
year
.
  
<EOS>
I
reached
the
moor
 
<EOS>
I
stood
again
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
 
<EOS>
I
looked
on
along
the
path
 
<EOS>
and
there
were
the
familiar
garden
trees
in
the
distance
,
the
clear
sweeping
semicircle
of
the
drive
,
the
high
white
walls
of
Limmeridge
House
.
<EOS>
The
chances
and
changes
,
the
wanderings
and
dangers
of
months
and
months
past
,
all
shrank
and
shrivelled
to
nothing
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
It
was
like
yesterday
since
my
feet
had
last
trodden
the
fragrant
heathy
ground
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
should
see
her
coming
to
meet
me
,
with
her
little
straw
hat
shading
her
face
,
her
simple
dress
fluttering
in
the
air
,
and
her
well
-
filled
sketch
-
book
ready
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
death
,
thou
hast
<EOS>
thy
sting
!
<EOS>
oh
,
grave
,
thou
hast
thy
victory
!
  
<EOS>
I
turned
aside
,
and
there
below
me
in
the
glen
was
the
lonesome
grey
church
,
the
porch
where
I
had
waited
for
the
coming
of
the
woman
in
white
,
the
hills
encircling
the
quiet
burial
-
ground
,
the
brook
bubbling
cold
over
its
stony
bed
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
marble
cross
,
fair
and
white
,
at
the
head
of
the
tomb
 
<EOS>
the
tomb
that
now
rose
over
mother
and
daughter
alike
.
  
<EOS>
I
approached
the
grave
.
<EOS>
I
crossed
once
more
the
low
stone
stile
,
and
bared
my
head
as
I
touched
the
sacred
ground
.
<EOS>
Sacred
to
gentleness
and
goodness
,
sacred
to
reverence
and
grief
.
  
<EOS>
I
stopped
before
the
pedestal
from
which
the
cross
rose
.
<EOS>
On
one
side
of
it
,
on
the
side
nearest
to
me
,
the
newly
-
cut
inscription
met
my
eyes
 
the
hard
,
clear
,
cruel
black
letters
which
told
the
story
of
her
life
and
death
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
read
them
.
<EOS>
I
did
read
as
far
as
the
name
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sacred
to
the
Memory
of
Laura
 
<EOS>
"
The
kind
blue
eyes
dim
with
tears
 
<EOS>
the
fair
head
drooping
wearily
 
the
innocent
parting
words
which
implored
me
to
leave
her
 
<EOS>
oh
,
for
a
happier
last
memory
of
her
than
this
;
the
memory
I
took
away
with
me
,
the
memory
I
bring
back
with
me
to
her
grave
!
  
<EOS>
A
second
time
I
tried
to
read
the
inscription
.
<EOS>
I
saw
at
the
end
the
date
of
her
death
,
and
above
it
    
<EOS>
Above
it
there
were
lines
on
the
marble
 
<EOS>
there
was
a
name
among
them
which
disturbed
my
thoughts
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
went
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
grave
,
where
there
was
nothing
to
read
,
nothing
of
earthly
vileness
to
force
its
way
between
her
spirit
and
mine
.
  
<EOS>
I
knelt
down
by
the
tomb
.
<EOS>
I
laid
my
hands
,
I
laid
my
head
on
the
broad
white
stone
,
and
closed
my
weary
eyes
on
the
earth
around
,
on
the
light
above
.
<EOS>
I
let
her
come
back
to
me
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
love
!
<EOS>
my
love
!
<EOS>
my
heart
may
speak
to
you
NOW
!
<EOS>
It
is
yesterday
again
since
we
parted
 
yesterday
,
since
your
dear
hand
lay
in
mine
 
yesterday
,
since
my
eyes
looked
their
last
on
you
.
<EOS>
My
love
!
<EOS>
my
love
!
     
<EOS>
Time
had
flowed
on
,
and
silence
had
fallen
like
thick
night
over
its
course
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
sound
that
came
after
the
heavenly
peace
rustled
faintly
like
a
passing
breath
of
air
over
the
grass
of
the
burial
-
ground
.
<EOS>
I
heard
it
nearing
me
slowly
,
until
it
came
changed
to
my
ear
 
<EOS>
came
like
footsteps
moving
onward
 
then
stopped
.
  
<EOS>
I
looked
up
.
  
<EOS>
The
sunset
was
near
at
hand
.
<EOS>
The
clouds
had
parted
 
the
slanting
light
fell
mellow
over
the
hills
.
<EOS>
The
last
of
the
day
was
cold
and
clear
and
still
in
the
quiet
valley
of
the
dead
.
  
<EOS>
Beyond
me
,
in
the
burial
-
ground
,
standing
together
in
the
cold
clearness
of
the
lower
light
,
I
saw
two
women
.
<EOS>
They
were
looking
towards
the
tomb
,
looking
towards
me
.
  
<EOS>
Two
.
  
<EOS>
They
came
a
little
on
,
and
stopped
again
.
<EOS>
Their
veils
were
down
,
and
hid
their
faces
from
me
.
<EOS>
When
they
stopped
,
one
of
them
raised
her
veil
.
<EOS>
In
the
still
evening
light
I
saw
the
face
of
Marian
Halcombe
.
  
<EOS>
Changed
,
changed
as
if
years
had
passed
over
it
!
<EOS>
The
eyes
large
and
wild
,
and
looking
at
me
with
a
strange
terror
in
them
.
<EOS>
The
face
worn
and
wasted
piteously
.
<EOS>
Pain
and
fear
and
grief
written
on
her
as
with
a
brand
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
one
step
towards
her
from
the
grave
.
<EOS>
She
never
moved
 
<EOS>
she
never
spoke
.
<EOS>
The
veiled
woman
with
her
cried
out
faintly
.
<EOS>
I
stopped
.
<EOS>
The
springs
of
my
life
fell
low
,
and
the
shuddering
of
an
unutterable
dread
crept
over
me
from
head
to
foot
.
  
<EOS>
The
woman
with
the
veiled
face
moved
away
from
her
companion
,
and
came
towards
me
slowly
.
<EOS>
Left
by
herself
,
standing
by
herself
,
Marian
Halcombe
spoke
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
voice
that
I
remembered
 
the
voice
not
changed
,
like
the
frightened
eyes
and
the
wasted
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dream
!
<EOS>
my
dream
!
<EOS>
"
I
heard
her
say
those
words
softly
in
the
awful
silence
.
<EOS>
She
sank
on
her
knees
,
and
raised
her
clasped
hands
to
heaven
.
"
<EOS>
Father
!
<EOS>
strengthen
him
.
<EOS>
Father
!
<EOS>
help
him
in
his
hour
of
need
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
woman
came
on
,
slowly
and
silently
came
on
.
<EOS>
I
looked
at
her
 
at
her
,
and
at
none
other
,
from
that
moment
.
  
<EOS>
The
voice
that
was
praying
for
me
faltered
and
sank
low
 
then
rose
on
a
sudden
,
and
called
affrightedly
,
called
despairingly
to
me
to
come
away
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
veiled
woman
had
possession
of
me
,
body
and
soul
.
<EOS>
She
stopped
on
one
side
of
the
grave
.
<EOS>
We
stood
face
to
face
with
the
tombstone
between
us
.
<EOS>
She
was
close
to
the
inscription
on
the
side
of
the
pedestal
.
<EOS>
Her
gown
touched
the
black
letters
.
  
<EOS>
The
voice
came
nearer
,
and
rose
and
rose
more
passionately
still
.
"
<EOS>
Hide
your
face
!
<EOS>
do
n't
look
at
her
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
for
God
's
sake
,
spare
him
 
"
  
The
woman
lifted
her
veil
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sacred
to
the
Memory
of
Laura
,
Lady
Glyde
 
"
  
<EOS>
Laura
,
Lady
Glyde
,
was
standing
by
the
inscription
,
and
was
looking
at
me
over
the
grave

THE
THIRD
EPOCH
  
<EOS>
THE
STORY
CONTINUED
BY
WALTER
HARTRIGHT
.
      
<EOS>
I
open
a
new
page
.
<EOS>
I
advance
my
narrative
by
one
week
.
  
<EOS>
The
history
of
the
interval
which
I
thus
pass
over
must
remain
unrecorded
.
<EOS>
My
heart
turns
faint
,
my
mind
sinks
in
darkness
and
confusion
when
I
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
This
must
not
be
,
if
I
who
write
am
to
guide
,
as
I
ought
,
you
who
read
.
<EOS>
This
must
not
be
,
if
the
clue
that
leads
through
the
windings
of
the
story
is
to
remain
from
end
to
end
untangled
in
my
hands
.
  
<EOS>
A
life
suddenly
changed
 
its
whole
purpose
created
afresh
,
<EOS>
its
hopes
and
fears
,
its
struggles
,
its
interests
,
and
its
sacrifices
all
turned
at
once
and
for
ever
into
a
new
direction
 
<EOS>
this
is
the
prospect
which
now
opens
before
me
,
like
the
burst
of
view
from
a
mountain
's
top
.
<EOS>
I
left
my
narrative
in
the
quiet
shadow
of
Limmeridge
church
 
<EOS>
I
resume
it
,
one
week
later
,
in
the
stir
and
turmoil
of
a
London
street
.
  
<EOS>
The
street
is
in
a
populous
and
a
poor
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
The
ground
floor
of
one
of
the
houses
in
it
is
occupied
by
a
small
newsvendor
's
shop
,
and
the
first
floor
and
the
second
are
let
as
furnished
lodgings
of
the
humblest
kind
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
taken
those
two
floors
in
an
assumed
name
.
<EOS>
On
the
upper
floor
I
live
,
with
a
room
to
work
in
,
a
room
to
sleep
in
.
<EOS>
On
the
lower
floor
,
under
the
same
assumed
name
,
two
women
live
,
who
are
described
as
my
sisters
.
<EOS>
I
get
my
bread
by
drawing
and
engraving
on
wood
for
the
cheap
periodicals
.
<EOS>
My
sisters
are
supposed
to
help
me
by
taking
in
a
little
needle
-
work
.
<EOS>
Our
poor
place
of
abode
,
our
humble
calling
,
our
assumed
relationship
,
and
our
assumed
name
,
are
all
used
alike
as
a
means
of
hiding
us
in
the
house
-
forest
of
London
.
<EOS>
We
are
numbered
no
longer
with
the
people
whose
lives
are
open
and
known
.
<EOS>
I
am
an
obscure
,
unnoticed
man
,
without
patron
or
friend
to
help
me
.
<EOS>
Marian
Halcombe
is
nothing
now
but
my
eldest
sister
,
who
provides
for
our
household
wants
by
the
toil
of
her
own
hands
.
<EOS>
We
two
,
in
the
estimation
of
others
,
are
at
once
the
dupes
and
the
agents
of
a
daring
imposture
.
<EOS>
We
are
supposed
to
be
the
accomplices
of
mad
Anne
Catherick
,
who
claims
the
name
,
the
place
,
and
the
living
personality
of
dead
Lady
Glyde
.
  
<EOS>
That
is
our
situation
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
changed
aspect
in
which
we
three
must
appear
,
henceforth
,
in
this
narrative
,
for
many
and
many
a
page
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
eye
of
reason
and
of
law
,
in
the
estimation
of
relatives
and
friends
,
according
to
every
received
formality
of
civilised
society
,
"
Laura
,
Lady
Glyde
,
"
lay
buried
with
her
mother
in
Limmeridge
churchyard
.
<EOS>
Torn
in
her
own
lifetime
from
the
list
of
the
living
,
the
daughter
of
Philip
Fairlie
and
the
wife
of
Percival
Glyde
might
still
exist
for
her
sister
,
might
still
exist
for
me
,
but
to
all
the
world
besides
she
was
dead
.
<EOS>
Dead
to
her
uncle
,
who
had
renounced
her
;
<EOS>
dead
to
the
servants
of
the
house
,
who
had
failed
to
recognise
her
;
dead
to
the
persons
in
authority
,
who
had
transmitted
her
fortune
to
her
husband
and
her
aunt
;
dead
to
my
mother
and
my
sister
,
<EOS>
who
believed
me
to
be
the
dupe
of
an
adventuress
and
the
victim
of
a
fraud
;
socially
,
morally
,
legally
 
dead
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
alive
!
<EOS>
Alive
in
poverty
and
in
hiding
.
<EOS>
Alive
,
with
the
poor
drawing
-
master
to
fight
her
battle
,
and
to
win
the
way
back
for
her
to
her
place
in
the
world
of
living
beings
.
  
<EOS>
Did
no
suspicion
,
excited
by
my
own
knowledge
of
Anne
Catherick
's
resemblance
to
her
,
cross
my
mind
,
when
her
face
was
first
revealed
to
me
?
<EOS>
Not
the
shadow
of
a
suspicion
,
from
the
moment
when
she
lifted
her
veil
by
the
side
of
the
inscription
which
recorded
her
death
.
  
<EOS>
Before
the
sun
of
that
day
had
set
,
before
the
last
glimpse
of
the
home
which
was
closed
against
her
had
passed
from
our
view
,
the
farewell
words
I
spoke
,
when
we
parted
at
Limmeridge
House
,
had
been
recalled
by
both
of
us
 
repeated
by
me
,
recognised
by
her
.
<EOS>
"
If
ever
the
time
comes
,
when
the
devotion
of
my
whole
heart
and
soul
and
strength
will
give
you
a
moment
's
happiness
,
or
spare
you
a
moment
's
sorrow
,
will
you
try
to
remember
the
poor
drawing
-
master
who
has
taught
you
?
"
<EOS>
She
,
who
now
remembered
so
little
of
the
trouble
and
terror
of
a
later
time
,
remembered
those
words
,
and
laid
her
poor
head
innocently
and
trustingly
on
the
bosom
of
the
man
who
had
spoken
them
.
<EOS>
In
that
moment
,
when
she
called
me
by
my
name
,
when
she
said
,
"
They
have
tried
to
make
me
forget
everything
,
Walter
;
but
I
remember
Marian
,
and
I
remember
YOU
"
 
in
that
moment
,
I
,
who
had
long
since
given
her
my
love
,
gave
her
my
life
,
and
thanked
God
that
it
was
mine
to
bestow
on
her
.
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
the
time
had
come
.
<EOS>
From
thousands
on
thousands
of
miles
away
 
through
forest
and
wilderness
,
where
companions
stronger
than
I
had
fallen
by
my
side
,
through
peril
of
death
thrice
renewed
,
and
thrice
escaped
,
the
Hand
that
leads
men
on
the
dark
road
to
the
future
had
led
me
to
meet
that
time
.
<EOS>
Forlorn
and
disowned
,
sorely
tried
and
sadly
changed
 
her
beauty
faded
,
her
mind
clouded
 
robbed
of
her
station
in
the
world
,
of
her
place
among
living
creatures
 
the
devotion
I
had
promised
,
the
devotion
of
my
whole
heart
and
soul
and
strength
,
might
be
laid
blamelessly
now
at
those
dear
feet
.
<EOS>
In
the
right
of
her
calamity
,
in
the
right
of
her
friendlessness
,
she
was
mine
at
last
!
<EOS>
Mine
to
support
,
to
protect
,
to
cherish
,
to
restore
.
<EOS>
Mine
to
love
and
honour
as
father
and
brother
both
.
<EOS>
Mine
to
vindicate
through
all
risks
and
all
sacrifices
 
through
the
hopeless
struggle
against
Rank
and
Power
,
through
the
long
fight
with
armed
deceit
and
fortified
Success
,
through
the
waste
of
my
reputation
,
through
the
loss
of
my
friends
,
through
the
hazard
of
my
life
.
    
<EOS>
My
position
is
defined
 
my
motives
are
acknowledged
.
<EOS>
The
story
of
Marian
and
the
story
of
Laura
must
come
next
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
relate
both
narratives
,
not
in
the
words
(
often
interrupted
,
often
inevitably
confused
)
of
the
speakers
themselves
,
but
in
the
words
of
the
brief
,
plain
,
studiously
simple
abstract
which
I
committed
to
writing
for
my
own
guidance
,
and
for
the
guidance
of
my
legal
adviser
.
<EOS>
So
the
tangled
web
will
be
most
speedily
and
most
intelligibly
unrolled
.
  
<EOS>
The
story
of
Marian
begins
where
the
narrative
of
the
housekeeper
at
Blackwater
Park
left
off
.
  
<EOS>
On
Lady
Glyde
's
departure
from
her
husband
's
house
,
the
fact
of
that
departure
,
and
the
necessary
statement
of
the
circumstances
under
which
it
had
taken
place
,
were
communicated
to
Miss
Halcombe
by
the
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
some
days
afterwards
(
how
many
days
exactly
,
Mrs.
Michelson
,
in
the
absence
of
any
written
memorandum
on
the
subject
,
could
not
undertake
to
say
)
that
a
letter
arrived
from
Madame
Fosco
announcing
Lady
Glyde
's
sudden
death
in
Count
Fosco
's
house
.
<EOS>
The
letter
avoided
mentioning
dates
,
and
left
it
to
Mrs.
Michelson
's
discretion
to
break
the
news
at
once
to
Miss
Halcombe
,
or
to
defer
doing
so
until
that
lady
's
health
should
be
more
firmly
established
.
  
<EOS>
Having
consulted
Mr.
Dawson
(
who
had
been
himself
delayed
,
by
ill
health
,
in
resuming
his
attendance
at
Blackwater
Park
)
,
Mrs.
Michelson
,
by
the
doctor
's
advice
,
and
in
the
doctor
's
presence
,
communicated
the
news
,
either
on
the
day
when
the
letter
was
received
,
or
on
the
day
after
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
necessary
to
dwell
here
upon
the
effect
<EOS>
which
the
intelligence
of
Lady
Glyde
's
sudden
death
produced
on
her
sister
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
useful
to
the
present
purpose
to
say
that
she
was
not
able
to
travel
for
more
than
three
weeks
afterwards
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
that
time
she
proceeded
to
London
accompanied
by
the
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
They
parted
there
 
Mrs.
Michelson
previously
informing
Miss
Halcombe
of
her
address
,
in
case
they
might
wish
to
communicate
at
a
future
period
.
  
<EOS>
On
parting
with
the
housekeeper
Miss
Halcombe
went
at
once
to
the
office
of
Messrs.
Gilmore
&
Kyrle
to
consult
with
the
latter
gentleman
in
Mr.
Gilmore
's
absence
.
<EOS>
She
mentioned
to
Mr.
Kyrle
what
she
had
thought
it
desirable
to
conceal
from
every
one
else
(
Mrs.
Michelson
included
)
 
her
suspicion
of
the
circumstances
under
which
Lady
Glyde
was
said
to
have
met
her
death
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kyrle
,
who
had
previously
given
friendly
proof
of
his
anxiety
to
serve
Miss
Halcombe
,
at
once
undertook
to
make
such
inquiries
as
the
delicate
and
dangerous
nature
of
the
investigation
proposed
to
him
would
permit
.
  
<EOS>
To
exhaust
this
part
of
the
subject
before
going
farther
,
it
may
be
mentioned
that
Count
Fosco
offered
every
facility
to
Mr.
Kyrle
,
on
that
gentleman
's
stating
that
he
was
sent
by
Miss
Halcombe
to
collect
such
particulars
as
had
not
yet
reached
her
of
Lady
Glyde
's
decease
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kyrle
was
placed
in
communication
with
the
medical
man
,
Mr.
Goodricke
,
and
with
the
two
servants
.
<EOS>
In
the
absence
of
any
means
of
ascertaining
the
exact
date
of
Lady
Glyde
's
departure
from
Blackwater
Park
,
the
result
of
the
doctor
's
and
the
servants
'
evidence
,
and
of
the
volunteered
statements
of
Count
Fosco
and
his
wife
,
was
conclusive
to
the
mind
of
Mr.
Kyrle
.
<EOS>
He
could
only
assume
that
the
intensity
of
Miss
Halcombe
's
suffering
,
under
the
loss
of
her
sister
,
had
misled
her
judgment
in
a
most
deplorable
manner
,
and
he
wrote
her
word
that
the
shocking
suspicion
to
which
she
had
alluded
in
his
presence
was
,
in
his
opinion
,
destitute
of
the
smallest
fragment
of
foundation
in
truth
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
investigation
by
Mr.
Gilmore
's
partner
began
and
ended
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Miss
Halcombe
had
returned
to
Limmeridge
House
,
and
had
there
collected
all
the
additional
information
which
she
was
able
to
obtain
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
had
received
his
first
intimation
of
his
niece
's
death
from
his
sister
,
Madame
Fosco
,
this
letter
also
not
containing
any
exact
reference
to
dates
.
<EOS>
He
had
sanctioned
his
sister
's
proposal
that
the
deceased
lady
should
be
laid
in
her
mother
's
grave
in
Limmeridge
churchyard
.
<EOS>
Count
Fosco
had
accompanied
the
remains
to
Cumberland
,
and
had
attended
the
funeral
at
Limmeridge
,
which
took
place
on
the
30th
of
July
.
<EOS>
It
was
followed
,
as
a
mark
of
respect
,
by
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
and
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
On
the
next
day
the
inscription
(
originally
drawn
out
,
it
was
said
,
by
the
aunt
of
the
deceased
lady
,
and
submitted
for
approval
to
her
brother
,
Mr.
Fairlie
)
was
engraved
on
one
side
of
the
monument
over
the
tomb
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
day
of
the
funeral
,
and
for
one
day
after
it
,
Count
Fosco
had
been
received
as
a
guest
at
Limmeridge
House
,
but
no
interview
had
taken
place
between
Mr.
Fairlie
and
himself
,
by
the
former
gentleman
's
desire
.
<EOS>
They
had
communicated
by
writing
,
and
through
this
medium
Count
Fosco
had
made
Mr.
Fairlie
acquainted
with
the
details
of
his
niece
's
last
illness
and
death
.
<EOS>
The
letter
presenting
this
information
added
no
new
facts
to
the
facts
already
known
,
but
one
very
remarkable
paragraph
was
contained
in
the
postscript
.
<EOS>
It
referred
to
Anne
Catherick
.
  
<EOS>
The
substance
of
the
paragraph
in
question
was
as
follows
    
<EOS>
It
first
informed
Mr.
Fairlie
that
Anne
Catherick
(
of
whom
he
might
hear
full
particulars
from
Miss
Halcombe
when
she
reached
Limmeridge
)
had
been
traced
and
recovered
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Blackwater
Park
,
and
had
been
for
the
second
time
placed
under
the
charge
of
the
medical
man
from
whose
custody
she
had
once
escaped
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
first
part
of
the
postscript
.
<EOS>
The
second
part
warned
Mr.
Fairlie
that
Anne
Catherick
's
mental
malady
had
been
aggravated
by
her
long
freedom
from
control
,
and
that
the
insane
hatred
and
distrust
of
Sir
Percival
Glyde
,
which
had
been
one
of
her
most
marked
delusions
in
former
times
,
still
existed
under
a
newly
-
acquired
form
.
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
woman
's
last
idea
in
connection
with
Sir
Percival
was
the
idea
of
annoying
and
distressing
him
,
and
of
elevating
herself
,
as
she
supposed
,
in
the
estimation
of
the
patients
and
nurses
,
by
assuming
the
character
of
his
deceased
wife
,
the
scheme
of
this
personation
having
evidently
occurred
to
her
after
a
stolen
interview
which
she
had
succeeded
in
obtaining
with
Lady
Glyde
,
and
at
which
she
had
observed
the
extraordinary
accidental
likeness
between
the
deceased
lady
and
herself
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
the
last
degree
improbable
that
she
would
succeed
a
second
time
in
escaping
from
the
Asylum
,
but
it
was
just
possible
she
might
find
some
means
of
annoying
the
late
Lady
Glyde
's
relatives
with
letters
,
and
in
that
case
Mr.
Fairlie
was
warned
beforehand
how
to
receive
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
postscript
,
expressed
in
these
terms
,
was
shown
to
Miss
Halcombe
when
she
arrived
at
Limmeridge
.
<EOS>
There
were
also
placed
in
her
possession
the
clothes
Lady
Glyde
had
worn
,
and
the
other
effects
she
had
brought
with
her
to
her
aunt
's
house
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
carefully
collected
and
sent
to
Cumberland
by
Madame
Fosco
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
the
posture
of
affairs
when
Miss
Halcombe
reached
Limmeridge
in
the
early
part
of
September
.
  
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
she
was
confined
to
her
room
by
a
relapse
,
her
weakened
physical
energies
giving
way
under
the
severe
mental
affliction
from
which
she
was
now
suffering
.
<EOS>
On
getting
stronger
again
,
in
a
month
's
time
,
her
suspicion
of
the
circumstances
described
as
attending
her
sister
's
death
still
remained
unshaken
.
<EOS>
She
had
heard
nothing
in
the
interim
of
Sir
Percival
Glyde
,
but
letters
had
reached
her
from
Madame
Fosco
,
making
the
most
affectionate
inquiries
on
the
part
of
her
husband
and
herself
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
answering
these
letters
,
Miss
Halcombe
caused
the
house
in
St.
John
's
Wood
,
and
the
proceedings
of
its
inmates
,
to
be
privately
watched
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
doubtful
was
discovered
.
<EOS>
The
same
result
attended
the
next
investigations
,
which
were
secretly
instituted
on
the
subject
of
Mrs.
Rubelle
.
<EOS>
She
had
arrived
in
London
about
six
months
before
with
her
husband
.
<EOS>
They
had
come
from
Lyons
,
and
they
had
taken
a
house
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Leicester
Square
,
to
be
fitted
up
as
a
boarding
-
house
for
foreigners
,
who
were
expected
to
visit
England
in
large
numbers
to
see
the
Exhibition
of
1851
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
known
against
husband
or
wife
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
They
were
quiet
people
,
and
they
had
paid
their
way
honestly
up
to
the
present
time
.
<EOS>
The
final
inquiries
related
to
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
He
was
settled
in
Paris
,
and
living
there
quietly
in
a
small
circle
of
English
and
French
friends
.
  
<EOS>
Foiled
at
all
points
,
but
still
not
able
to
rest
,
Miss
Halcombe
next
determined
to
visit
the
Asylum
in
which
she
then
supposed
Anne
Catherick
to
be
for
the
second
time
confined
.
<EOS>
She
had
felt
a
strong
curiosity
about
the
woman
in
former
days
,
and
she
was
now
doubly
interested
 
first
,
in
ascertaining
whether
the
report
of
Anne
Catherick
's
attempted
personation
of
Lady
Glyde
was
true
,
and
secondly
(
if
it
proved
to
be
true
)
,
in
discovering
for
herself
what
the
poor
creature
's
real
motives
were
for
attempting
the
deceit
.
  
<EOS>
Although
Count
Fosco
's
letter
to
Mr.
Fairlie
did
not
mention
the
address
of
the
Asylum
,
that
important
omission
cast
no
difficulties
in
Miss
Halcombe
's
way
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Hartright
had
met
Anne
Catherick
at
Limmeridge
,
she
had
informed
him
of
the
locality
in
which
the
house
was
situated
,
and
Miss
Halcombe
had
noted
down
the
direction
in
her
diary
,
with
all
the
other
particulars
of
the
interview
exactly
as
she
heard
them
from
Mr.
Hartright
's
own
lips
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
she
looked
back
at
the
entry
and
extracted
the
address
 
furnished
herself
with
the
Count
's
letter
to
Mr.
Fairlie
as
a
species
of
credential
which
might
be
useful
to
her
,
and
started
by
herself
for
the
Asylum
on
the
eleventh
of
October
.
  
<EOS>
She
passed
the
night
of
the
eleventh
in
London
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
her
intention
to
sleep
at
the
house
inhabited
by
Lady
Glyde
's
old
governess
,
but
Mrs.
Vesey
's
agitation
at
the
sight
of
her
lost
pupil
's
nearest
and
dearest
friend
was
so
distressing
that
Miss
Halcombe
considerately
refrained
from
remaining
in
her
presence
,
and
removed
to
a
respectable
boarding
-
house
in
the
neighbourhood
,
recommended
by
Mrs.
Vesey
's
married
sister
.
<EOS>
The
next
day
she
proceeded
to
the
Asylum
,
which
was
situated
not
far
from
London
on
the
northern
side
of
the
metropolis
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
immediately
admitted
to
see
the
proprietor
.
  
<EOS>
At
first
he
appeared
to
be
decidedly
unwilling
to
let
her
communicate
with
his
patient
.
<EOS>
But
on
her
showing
him
the
postscript
to
Count
Fosco
's
letter
 
on
her
reminding
him
that
she
was
the
"
Miss
Halcombe
"
there
referred
to
 
that
she
was
a
near
relative
of
the
deceased
Lady
Glyde
 
and
that
she
was
therefore
naturally
interested
,
for
family
reasons
,
in
observing
for
herself
the
extent
of
Anne
Catherick
's
delusion
in
relation
to
her
late
sister
 
<EOS>
the
tone
and
manner
of
the
owner
of
the
Asylum
altered
,
and
he
withdrew
his
objections
.
<EOS>
He
probably
felt
that
a
continued
refusal
,
under
these
circumstances
,
would
not
only
be
an
act
of
discourtesy
in
itself
,
but
would
also
imply
that
the
proceedings
in
his
establishment
were
not
of
a
nature
to
bear
investigation
by
respectable
strangers
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
's
own
impression
was
that
the
owner
of
the
Asylum
had
not
been
received
into
the
confidence
of
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
.
<EOS>
His
consenting
at
all
to
let
her
visit
his
patient
seemed
to
afford
one
proof
of
this
,
and
his
readiness
in
making
admissions
which
could
scarcely
have
escaped
the
lips
of
an
accomplice
,
certainly
appeared
to
furnish
another
.
  
<EOS>
For
example
,
in
the
course
of
the
introductory
conversation
which
took
place
,
he
informed
Miss
Halcombe
that
Anne
Catherick
had
been
brought
back
to
him
with
the
necessary
order
and
certificates
by
Count
Fosco
on
the
twenty
-
seventh
of
July
 
the
Count
also
producing
a
letter
of
explanations
and
instructions
signed
by
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
On
receiving
his
inmate
again
,
the
proprietor
of
the
Asylum
acknowledged
that
he
had
observed
some
curious
personal
changes
in
her
.
<EOS>
Such
changes
no
doubt
were
not
without
precedent
in
his
experience
of
persons
mentally
afflicted
.
<EOS>
Insane
people
were
often
at
one
time
,
outwardly
as
well
as
inwardly
,
unlike
what
they
were
at
another
 
the
change
from
better
to
worse
,
or
from
worse
to
better
,
in
the
madness
having
a
necessary
tendency
to
produce
alterations
of
appearance
externally
.
<EOS>
He
allowed
for
these
,
and
he
allowed
also
for
the
modification
in
the
form
of
Anne
Catherick
's
delusion
,
which
was
reflected
no
doubt
in
her
manner
and
expression
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
still
perplexed
at
times
by
certain
differences
between
his
patient
before
she
had
escaped
and
his
patient
since
she
had
been
brought
back
.
<EOS>
Those
differences
were
too
minute
to
be
described
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
say
of
course
that
she
was
absolutely
altered
in
height
or
shape
or
complexion
,
or
in
the
colour
of
her
hair
and
eyes
,
or
in
the
general
form
of
her
face
 
<EOS>
the
change
was
something
that
he
felt
more
than
something
that
he
saw
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
case
had
been
a
puzzle
from
the
first
,
and
one
more
perplexity
was
added
to
it
now
.
  
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
said
that
this
conversation
led
to
the
result
of
even
partially
preparing
Miss
Halcombe
's
mind
for
what
was
to
come
.
<EOS>
But
it
produced
,
nevertheless
,
a
very
serious
effect
upon
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
completely
unnerved
by
it
,
that
some
little
time
elapsed
before
she
could
summon
composure
enough
to
follow
the
proprietor
of
the
Asylum
to
that
part
of
the
house
in
which
the
inmates
were
confined
.
  
<EOS>
On
inquiry
,
it
turned
out
that
the
supposed
Anne
Catherick
was
then
taking
exercise
in
the
grounds
attached
to
the
establishment
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
nurses
volunteered
to
conduct
Miss
Halcombe
to
the
place
,
the
proprietor
of
the
Asylum
remaining
in
the
house
for
a
few
minutes
to
attend
to
a
case
which
required
his
services
,
and
then
engaging
to
join
his
visitor
in
the
grounds
.
  
<EOS>
The
nurse
led
Miss
Halcombe
to
a
distant
part
of
the
property
,
which
was
prettily
laid
out
,
and
after
looking
about
her
a
little
,
turned
into
a
turf
walk
,
shaded
by
a
shrubbery
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
About
half
-
way
down
this
walk
two
women
were
slowly
approaching
.
<EOS>
The
nurse
pointed
to
them
and
said
,
"
There
is
Anne
Catherick
,
ma'am
,
with
the
attendant
who
waits
on
her
.
<EOS>
The
attendant
will
answer
any
questions
you
wish
to
put
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
those
words
the
nurse
left
her
to
return
to
the
duties
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
advanced
on
her
side
,
and
the
women
advanced
on
theirs
.
<EOS>
When
they
were
within
a
dozen
paces
of
each
other
,
one
of
the
women
stopped
for
an
instant
,
looked
eagerly
at
the
strange
lady
,
shook
off
the
nurse
's
grasp
on
her
,
and
the
next
moment
rushed
into
Miss
Halcombe
's
arms
.
<EOS>
In
that
moment
Miss
Halcombe
recognised
her
sister
 
recognised
the
dead
-
alive
.
  
<EOS>
Fortunately
for
the
success
of
the
measures
taken
subsequently
,
no
one
was
present
at
that
moment
but
the
nurse
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
young
woman
,
and
she
was
so
startled
that
she
was
at
first
quite
incapable
of
interfering
.
<EOS>
When
she
was
able
to
do
so
her
whole
services
were
required
by
Miss
Halcombe
,
who
had
for
the
moment
sunk
altogether
in
the
effort
to
keep
her
own
senses
under
the
shock
of
the
discovery
.
<EOS>
After
waiting
a
few
minutes
in
the
fresh
air
and
the
cool
shade
,
her
natural
energy
and
courage
helped
her
a
little
,
and
she
became
sufficiently
mistress
of
herself
to
feel
the
necessity
of
recalling
her
presence
of
mind
for
her
unfortunate
sister
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
She
obtained
permission
to
speak
alone
with
the
patient
,
on
condition
that
they
both
remained
well
within
the
nurse
's
view
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
time
for
questions
 
there
was
only
time
for
Miss
Halcombe
to
impress
on
the
unhappy
lady
the
necessity
of
controlling
herself
,
and
to
assure
her
of
immediate
help
and
rescue
if
she
did
so
.
<EOS>
The
prospect
of
escaping
from
the
Asylum
by
obedience
to
her
sister
's
directions
was
sufficient
to
quiet
Lady
Glyde
,
and
to
make
her
understand
what
was
required
of
her
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
next
returned
to
the
nurse
,
placed
all
the
gold
she
then
had
in
her
pocket
(
three
sovereigns
)
in
the
nurse
's
hands
,
and
asked
when
and
where
she
could
speak
to
her
alone
.
  
<EOS>
The
woman
was
at
first
surprised
and
distrustful
.
<EOS>
But
on
Miss
Halcombe
's
declaring
that
she
only
wanted
to
put
some
questions
which
she
was
too
much
agitated
to
ask
at
that
moment
,
and
that
she
had
no
intention
of
misleading
the
nurse
into
any
dereliction
of
duty
,
the
woman
took
the
money
,
and
proposed
three
o'clock
on
the
next
day
as
the
time
for
the
interview
.
<EOS>
She
might
then
slip
out
for
half
an
hour
,
after
the
patients
had
dined
,
and
she
would
meet
the
lady
in
a
retired
place
,
outside
the
high
north
wall
which
screened
the
grounds
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
had
only
time
to
assent
,
and
to
whisper
to
her
sister
that
she
should
hear
from
her
on
the
next
day
,
when
the
proprietor
of
the
Asylum
joined
them
.
<EOS>
He
noticed
his
visitor
's
agitation
,
which
Miss
Halcombe
accounted
for
by
saying
that
her
interview
with
Anne
Catherick
had
a
little
startled
her
at
first
.
<EOS>
She
took
her
leave
as
soon
after
as
possible
 
that
is
to
say
,
as
soon
as
she
could
summon
courage
to
force
herself
from
the
presence
of
her
unfortunate
sister
.
  
<EOS>
A
very
little
reflection
,
when
the
capacity
to
reflect
returned
,
convinced
her
that
any
attempt
to
identify
Lady
Glyde
and
to
rescue
her
by
legal
means
,
would
,
even
if
successful
,
involve
a
delay
that
might
be
fatal
to
her
sister
's
intellects
,
which
were
shaken
already
by
the
horror
of
the
situation
to
which
she
had
been
consigned
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
Miss
Halcombe
had
got
back
to
London
,
she
had
determined
to
effect
Lady
Glyde
's
escape
privately
,
by
means
of
the
nurse
.
  
<EOS>
She
went
at
once
to
her
stockbroker
,
and
sold
out
of
the
funds
all
the
little
property
she
possessed
,
amounting
to
rather
less
than
seven
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
Determined
,
if
necessary
,
to
pay
the
price
of
her
sister
's
liberty
with
every
farthing
she
had
in
the
world
,
she
repaired
the
next
day
,
having
the
whole
sum
about
her
in
bank
-
notes
,
to
her
appointment
outside
the
Asylum
wall
.
  
<EOS>
The
nurse
was
there
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
approached
the
subject
cautiously
by
many
preliminary
questions
.
<EOS>
She
discovered
,
among
other
particulars
,
that
the
nurse
who
had
in
former
times
attended
on
the
true
Anne
Catherick
had
been
held
responsible
(
although
she
was
not
to
blame
for
it
)
for
the
patient
's
escape
,
and
had
lost
her
place
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
The
same
penalty
,
it
was
added
,
would
attach
to
the
person
then
speaking
to
her
,
if
the
supposed
Anne
Catherick
was
missing
a
second
time
;
and
,
moreover
,
the
nurse
in
this
case
had
an
especial
interest
in
keeping
her
place
.
<EOS>
She
was
engaged
to
be
married
,
and
she
and
her
future
husband
were
waiting
till
they
could
save
,
together
,
between
two
and
three
hundred
pounds
to
start
in
business
.
<EOS>
The
nurse
's
wages
were
good
,
and
she
might
succeed
,
by
strict
economy
,
in
contributing
her
small
share
towards
the
sum
required
in
two
years
'
time
.
  
<EOS>
On
this
hint
Miss
Halcombe
spoke
.
<EOS>
She
declared
that
the
supposed
Anne
Catherick
was
nearly
related
to
her
,
that
she
had
been
placed
in
the
Asylum
under
a
fatal
mistake
,
and
that
the
nurse
would
be
doing
a
good
and
a
Christian
action
in
being
the
means
of
restoring
them
to
one
another
.
<EOS>
Before
there
was
time
to
start
a
single
objection
,
Miss
Halcombe
took
four
bank
-
notes
of
a
hundred
pounds
each
from
her
pocket
-
book
,
and
offered
them
to
the
woman
,
as
a
compensation
for
the
risk
she
was
to
run
,
and
for
the
loss
of
her
place
.
  
<EOS>
The
nurse
hesitated
,
through
sheer
incredulity
and
surprise
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
pressed
the
point
on
her
firmly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
doing
a
good
action
,
"
she
repeated
;
"
you
will
be
helping
the
most
injured
and
unhappy
woman
alive
.
<EOS>
There
is
your
marriage
portion
for
a
reward
.
<EOS>
Bring
her
safely
to
me
here
,
and
I
will
put
these
four
bank
-
notes
into
your
hand
before
I
claim
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
give
me
a
letter
saying
those
words
,
which
I
can
show
to
my
sweetheart
when
he
asks
how
I
got
the
money
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
bring
the
letter
with
me
,
ready
written
and
signed
,
"
answered
Miss
Halcombe
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'll
risk
it
,
"
said
the
nurse
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
?
"
  
"
To
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
hastily
agreed
between
them
that
Miss
Halcombe
should
return
early
the
next
morning
and
wait
out
of
sight
among
the
trees
 
always
,
however
,
keeping
near
the
quiet
spot
of
ground
under
the
north
wall
.
<EOS>
The
nurse
could
fix
no
time
for
her
appearance
,
caution
requiring
that
she
should
wait
and
be
guided
by
circumstances
.
<EOS>
On
that
understanding
they
separated
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
was
at
her
place
,
with
the
promised
letter
and
the
promised
bank
-
notes
,
before
ten
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
She
waited
more
than
an
hour
and
a
half
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
that
time
the
nurse
came
quickly
round
the
corner
of
the
wall
holding
Lady
Glyde
by
the
arm
.
<EOS>
The
moment
they
met
Miss
Halcombe
put
the
bank
-
notes
and
the
letter
into
her
hand
,
and
the
sisters
were
united
again
.
  
<EOS>
The
nurse
had
dressed
Lady
Glyde
,
with
excellent
forethought
,
in
a
bonnet
,
veil
,
and
shawl
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
only
detained
her
to
suggest
a
means
of
turning
the
pursuit
in
a
false
direction
,
when
the
escape
was
discovered
at
the
Asylum
.
<EOS>
She
was
to
go
back
to
the
house
,
to
mention
in
the
hearing
of
the
other
nurses
that
Anne
Catherick
had
been
inquiring
latterly
about
the
distance
from
London
to
Hampshire
,
to
wait
till
the
last
moment
,
before
discovery
was
inevitable
,
and
then
to
give
the
alarm
that
Anne
was
missing
.
<EOS>
The
supposed
inquiries
about
Hampshire
,
when
communicated
to
the
owner
of
the
Asylum
,
would
lead
him
to
imagine
that
his
patient
had
returned
to
Blackwater
Park
,
under
the
influence
of
the
delusion
which
made
her
persist
in
asserting
herself
to
be
Lady
Glyde
,
and
the
first
pursuit
would
,
in
all
probability
,
be
turned
in
that
direction
.
  
<EOS>
The
nurse
consented
to
follow
these
suggestions
,
the
more
readily
as
they
offered
her
the
means
of
securing
herself
against
any
worse
consequences
than
the
loss
of
her
place
,
by
remaining
in
the
Asylum
,
and
so
maintaining
the
appearance
of
innocence
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
She
at
once
returned
to
the
house
,
and
Miss
Halcombe
lost
no
time
in
taking
her
sister
back
with
her
to
London
.
<EOS>
They
caught
the
afternoon
train
to
Carlisle
the
same
afternoon
,
and
arrived
at
Limmeridge
,
without
accident
or
difficulty
of
any
kind
,
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
During
the
latter
part
of
their
journey
they
were
alone
in
the
carriage
,
and
Miss
Halcombe
was
able
to
collect
such
remembrances
of
the
past
as
her
sister
's
confused
and
weakened
memory
was
able
to
recall
.
<EOS>
The
terrible
story
of
the
conspiracy
so
obtained
was
presented
in
fragments
,
sadly
incoherent
in
themselves
,
and
widely
detached
from
each
other
.
<EOS>
Imperfect
as
the
revelation
was
,
it
must
nevertheless
be
recorded
here
before
this
explanatory
narrative
closes
with
the
events
of
the
next
day
at
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
's
recollection
of
the
events
which
followed
her
departure
from
Blackwater
Park
began
with
her
arrival
at
the
London
terminus
of
the
South
Western
Railway
.
<EOS>
She
had
omitted
to
make
a
memorandum
beforehand
of
the
day
on
which
she
took
the
journey
.
<EOS>
All
hope
of
fixing
that
important
date
by
any
evidence
of
hers
,
or
of
Mrs.
Michelson
's
,
must
be
given
up
for
lost
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
arrival
of
the
train
at
the
platform
Lady
Glyde
found
Count
Fosco
waiting
for
her
.
<EOS>
He
was
at
the
carriage
door
as
soon
as
the
porter
could
open
it
.
<EOS>
The
train
was
unusually
crowded
,
and
there
was
great
confusion
in
getting
the
luggage
.
<EOS>
Some
person
whom
Count
Fosco
brought
with
him
procured
the
luggage
which
belonged
to
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
It
was
marked
with
her
name
.
<EOS>
She
drove
away
alone
with
the
Count
in
a
vehicle
which
she
did
not
particularly
notice
at
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
Her
first
question
,
on
leaving
the
terminus
,
referred
to
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
The
Count
informed
her
that
Miss
Halcombe
had
not
yet
gone
to
Cumberland
,
after
-
consideration
having
caused
him
to
doubt
the
prudence
of
her
taking
so
long
a
journey
without
some
days
'
previous
rest
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
next
inquired
whether
her
sister
was
then
staying
in
the
Count
's
house
.
<EOS>
Her
recollection
of
the
answer
was
confused
,
her
only
distinct
impression
in
relation
to
it
being
that
the
Count
declared
he
was
then
taking
her
to
see
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
's
experience
of
London
was
so
limited
that
she
could
not
tell
,
at
the
time
,
through
what
streets
they
were
driving
.
<EOS>
But
they
never
left
the
streets
,
and
they
never
passed
any
gardens
or
trees
.
<EOS>
When
the
carriage
stopped
,
it
stopped
in
a
small
street
behind
a
square
 
a
square
in
which
there
were
shops
,
and
public
buildings
,
and
many
people
.
<EOS>
From
these
recollections
(
of
which
Lady
Glyde
was
certain
)
<EOS>
it
seems
quite
clear
that
Count
Fosco
did
not
take
her
to
his
own
residence
in
the
suburb
of
St.
John
's
Wood
.
  
<EOS>
They
entered
the
house
,
and
went
upstairs
to
a
back
room
,
either
on
the
first
or
second
floor
.
<EOS>
The
luggage
was
carefully
brought
in
.
<EOS>
A
female
servant
opened
the
door
,
and
a
man
with
a
dark
beard
,
apparently
a
foreigner
,
met
them
in
the
hall
,
and
with
great
politeness
showed
them
the
way
upstairs
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
Lady
Glyde
's
inquiries
,
the
Count
assured
her
that
Miss
Halcombe
was
in
the
house
,
and
that
she
should
be
immediately
informed
of
her
sister
's
arrival
.
<EOS>
He
and
the
foreigner
then
went
away
and
left
her
by
herself
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
was
poorly
furnished
as
a
sitting
-
room
,
and
it
looked
out
on
the
backs
of
houses
.
  
<EOS>
The
place
was
remarkably
quiet
 
<EOS>
no
footsteps
went
up
or
down
the
stairs
 
<EOS>
she
only
heard
in
the
room
beneath
her
a
dull
,
rumbling
sound
of
men
's
voices
talking
.
<EOS>
Before
she
had
been
long
left
alone
the
Count
returned
,
to
explain
that
Miss
Halcombe
was
then
taking
rest
,
and
could
not
be
disturbed
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
He
was
accompanied
into
the
room
by
a
gentleman
(
an
Englishman
)
,
whom
he
begged
to
present
as
a
friend
of
his
.
  
<EOS>
After
this
singular
introduction
 
in
the
course
of
which
no
names
,
to
the
best
of
Lady
Glyde
's
recollection
,
had
been
mentioned
 
she
was
left
alone
with
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
He
was
perfectly
civil
,
but
he
startled
and
confused
her
by
some
odd
questions
about
herself
,
and
by
looking
at
her
,
while
he
asked
them
,
in
a
strange
manner
.
<EOS>
After
remaining
a
short
time
he
went
out
,
and
a
minute
or
two
afterwards
a
second
stranger
 
also
an
Englishman
 
came
in
.
<EOS>
This
person
introduced
himself
as
another
friend
of
Count
Fosco
's
,
and
he
,
in
his
turn
,
looked
at
her
very
oddly
,
and
asked
some
curious
questions
 
never
,
as
well
as
she
could
remember
,
addressing
her
by
name
,
and
going
out
again
,
after
a
little
while
,
like
the
first
man
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
she
was
so
frightened
about
herself
,
and
so
uneasy
about
her
sister
,
that
she
had
thoughts
of
venturing
downstairs
again
,
and
claiming
the
protection
and
assistance
of
the
only
woman
she
had
seen
in
the
house
 
<EOS>
the
servant
who
answered
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
Just
as
she
had
risen
from
her
chair
,
the
Count
came
back
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
moment
he
appeared
she
asked
anxiously
how
long
the
meeting
between
her
sister
and
herself
was
to
be
still
delayed
.
<EOS>
At
first
he
returned
an
evasive
answer
,
but
on
being
pressed
,
he
acknowledged
,
with
great
apparent
reluctance
,
that
Miss
Halcombe
was
by
no
means
so
well
as
he
had
hitherto
represented
her
to
be
.
<EOS>
His
tone
and
manner
,
in
making
this
reply
,
so
alarmed
Lady
Glyde
,
or
rather
so
painfully
increased
the
uneasiness
which
she
had
felt
in
the
company
of
the
two
strangers
,
that
a
sudden
faintness
overcame
her
,
and
she
was
obliged
to
ask
for
a
glass
of
water
.
<EOS>
The
Count
called
from
the
door
for
water
,
and
for
a
bottle
of
smelling
-
salts
.
<EOS>
Both
were
brought
in
by
the
foreign
-
looking
man
with
the
beard
.
<EOS>
The
water
,
when
Lady
Glyde
attempted
to
drink
it
,
had
so
strange
a
taste
that
it
increased
her
faintness
,
and
she
hastily
took
the
bottle
of
salts
from
Count
Fosco
,
and
smelt
at
it
.
<EOS>
Her
head
became
giddy
on
the
instant
.
<EOS>
The
Count
caught
the
bottle
as
it
dropped
out
of
her
hand
,
and
the
last
impression
of
which
she
was
conscious
was
that
he
held
it
to
her
nostrils
again
.
  
<EOS>
From
this
point
her
recollections
were
found
to
be
confused
,
fragmentary
,
and
difficult
to
reconcile
with
any
reasonable
probability
.
  
<EOS>
Her
own
impression
was
that
she
recovered
her
senses
later
in
the
evening
,
that
she
then
left
the
house
,
that
she
went
(
as
she
had
previously
arranged
to
go
,
at
Blackwater
Park
)
to
Mrs.
Vesey
's
 
that
she
drank
tea
there
,
and
that
she
passed
the
night
under
Mrs.
Vesey
's
roof
.
<EOS>
She
was
totally
unable
to
say
how
,
or
when
,
or
in
what
company
she
left
the
house
to
which
Count
Fosco
had
brought
her
.
<EOS>
But
she
persisted
in
asserting
that
she
had
been
to
Mrs.
Vesey
's
,
and
still
more
extraordinary
,
that
she
had
been
helped
to
undress
and
get
to
bed
by
Mrs.
Rubelle
!
<EOS>
She
could
not
remember
what
the
conversation
was
at
Mrs.
Vesey
's
or
whom
she
saw
there
besides
that
lady
,
or
why
Mrs.
Rubelle
should
have
been
present
in
the
house
to
help
her
.
  
<EOS>
Her
recollection
of
what
happened
to
her
the
next
morning
was
still
more
vague
and
unreliable
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
some
dim
idea
of
driving
out
(
at
what
hour
she
could
not
say
)
with
Count
Fosco
,
and
with
Mrs.
Rubelle
again
for
a
female
attendant
.
<EOS>
But
when
,
and
why
,
she
left
Mrs.
Vesey
she
could
not
tell
;
neither
did
she
know
what
direction
the
carriage
drove
in
,
or
where
it
set
her
down
,
or
whether
the
Count
and
Mrs.
Rubelle
did
or
did
not
remain
with
her
all
the
time
she
was
out
.
<EOS>
At
this
point
in
her
sad
story
there
was
a
total
blank
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
impressions
of
the
faintest
kind
to
communicate
 
no
idea
whether
one
day
,
or
more
than
one
day
,
had
passed
 
until
she
came
to
herself
suddenly
in
a
strange
place
,
surrounded
by
women
who
were
all
unknown
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
Asylum
.
<EOS>
Here
she
first
heard
herself
called
by
Anne
Catherick
's
name
,
and
here
,
as
a
last
remarkable
circumstance
in
the
story
of
the
conspiracy
,
her
own
eyes
informed
her
that
she
had
Anne
Catherick
's
clothes
on
.
<EOS>
The
nurse
,
on
the
first
night
in
the
Asylum
,
had
shown
her
the
marks
on
each
article
of
her
underclothing
as
it
was
taken
off
,
and
had
said
,
not
at
all
irritably
or
unkindly
,
"
Look
at
your
own
name
on
your
own
clothes
,
and
do
n't
worry
us
all
any
more
about
being
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
She
's
dead
and
buried
,
and
you
're
alive
and
hearty
.
<EOS>
Do
look
at
your
clothes
now
!
<EOS>
There
it
is
,
in
good
marking
ink
,
and
there
you
will
find
it
on
all
your
old
things
,
which
we
have
kept
in
the
house
 
Anne
Catherick
,
as
plain
as
print
!
"
<EOS>
And
there
it
was
,
when
Miss
Halcombe
examined
the
linen
her
sister
wore
,
on
the
night
of
their
arrival
at
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
These
were
the
only
recollections
 
all
of
them
uncertain
,
and
some
of
them
contradictory
 
which
could
be
extracted
from
Lady
Glyde
by
careful
questioning
on
the
journey
to
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
abstained
from
pressing
her
with
any
inquiries
relating
to
events
in
the
Asylum
 
<EOS>
her
mind
being
but
too
evidently
unfit
to
bear
the
trial
of
reverting
to
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
known
,
by
the
voluntary
admission
of
the
owner
of
the
mad
-
house
,
that
she
was
received
there
on
the
twenty
-
seventh
of
July
.
<EOS>
From
that
date
until
the
fifteenth
of
October
(
the
day
of
her
rescue
)
<EOS>
she
had
been
under
restraint
,
her
identity
with
Anne
Catherick
systematically
asserted
,
and
her
sanity
,
from
first
to
last
,
practically
denied
.
<EOS>
Faculties
less
delicately
balanced
,
constitutions
less
tenderly
organised
,
must
have
suffered
under
such
an
ordeal
as
this
.
<EOS>
No
man
could
have
gone
through
it
and
come
out
of
it
unchanged
.
  
<EOS>
Arriving
at
Limmeridge
late
on
the
evening
of
the
fifteenth
,
Miss
Halcombe
wisely
resolved
not
to
attempt
the
assertion
of
Lady
Glyde
's
identity
until
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
thing
in
the
morning
<EOS>
she
went
to
Mr.
Fairlie
's
room
,
and
using
all
possible
cautions
and
preparations
beforehand
,
at
last
told
him
in
so
many
words
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
his
first
astonishment
and
alarm
had
subsided
,
he
angrily
declared
that
Miss
Halcombe
had
allowed
herself
to
be
duped
by
Anne
Catherick
.
<EOS>
He
referred
her
to
Count
Fosco
's
letter
,
and
to
what
she
had
herself
told
him
of
the
personal
resemblance
between
Anne
and
his
deceased
niece
,
and
he
positively
declined
to
admit
to
his
presence
,
even
for
one
minute
only
,
a
madwoman
,
whom
it
was
an
insult
and
an
outrage
to
have
brought
into
his
house
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
left
the
room
 
waited
till
the
first
heat
of
her
indignation
had
passed
away
 
decided
on
reflection
that
Mr.
Fairlie
should
see
his
niece
in
the
interests
of
common
humanity
before
he
closed
his
doors
on
her
as
a
stranger
 
and
thereupon
,
without
a
word
of
previous
warning
,
took
Lady
Glyde
with
her
to
his
room
.
<EOS>
The
servant
was
posted
at
the
door
to
prevent
their
entrance
,
but
Miss
Halcombe
insisted
on
passing
him
,
and
made
her
way
into
Mr.
Fairlie
's
presence
,
leading
her
sister
by
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
The
scene
that
followed
,
though
it
only
lasted
for
a
few
minutes
,
was
too
painful
to
be
described
 
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
herself
shrank
from
referring
to
it
.
<EOS>
Let
it
be
enough
to
say
that
Mr.
Fairlie
declared
,
in
the
most
positive
terms
,
that
he
did
not
recognise
the
woman
who
had
been
brought
into
his
room
 
that
he
saw
nothing
in
her
face
and
manner
to
make
him
doubt
for
a
moment
that
his
niece
lay
buried
in
Limmeridge
churchyard
,
and
that
he
would
call
on
the
law
to
protect
him
if
before
the
day
was
over
<EOS>
she
was
not
removed
from
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Taking
the
very
worst
view
of
Mr.
Fairlie
's
selfishness
,
indolence
,
and
habitual
want
of
feeling
,
it
was
manifestly
impossible
to
suppose
that
he
was
capable
of
such
infamy
as
secretly
recognising
and
openly
disowning
his
brother
's
child
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
humanely
and
sensibly
allowed
all
due
force
to
the
influence
of
prejudice
and
alarm
in
preventing
him
from
fairly
exercising
his
perceptions
,
and
accounted
for
what
had
happened
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
But
when
she
next
put
the
servants
to
the
test
,
and
found
that
they
too
were
,
in
every
case
,
uncertain
,
to
say
the
least
of
it
,
whether
the
lady
presented
to
them
was
their
young
mistress
or
Anne
Catherick
,
of
whose
resemblance
to
her
they
had
all
heard
,
the
sad
conclusion
was
inevitable
that
the
change
produced
in
Lady
Glyde
's
face
and
manner
by
her
imprisonment
in
the
Asylum
was
far
more
serious
than
Miss
Halcombe
had
at
first
supposed
.
<EOS>
The
vile
deception
which
had
asserted
her
death
defied
exposure
even
in
the
house
where
she
was
born
,
and
among
the
people
with
whom
she
had
lived
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
less
critical
situation
the
effort
need
not
have
been
given
up
as
hopeless
even
yet
.
  
<EOS>
For
example
,
the
maid
,
Fanny
,
who
happened
to
be
then
absent
from
Limmeridge
,
was
expected
back
in
two
days
,
and
there
would
be
a
chance
of
gaining
her
recognition
to
start
with
,
seeing
that
she
had
been
in
much
more
constant
communication
with
her
mistress
,
and
had
been
much
more
heartily
attached
to
her
than
the
other
servants
.
<EOS>
Again
,
Lady
Glyde
might
have
been
privately
kept
in
the
house
or
in
the
village
to
wait
until
her
health
was
a
little
recovered
and
her
mind
was
a
little
steadied
again
.
<EOS>
When
her
memory
could
be
once
more
trusted
to
serve
her
,
she
would
naturally
refer
to
persons
and
events
in
the
past
with
a
certainty
and
a
familiarity
which
no
impostor
could
simulate
,
and
so
the
fact
of
her
identity
,
which
her
own
appearance
had
failed
to
establish
,
might
subsequently
be
proved
,
with
time
to
help
her
,
by
the
surer
test
of
her
own
words
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
circumstances
under
which
she
had
regained
her
freedom
rendered
all
recourse
to
such
means
as
these
simply
impracticable
.
<EOS>
The
pursuit
from
the
Asylum
,
diverted
to
Hampshire
for
the
time
only
,
would
infallibly
next
take
the
direction
of
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
The
persons
appointed
to
seek
the
fugitive
might
arrive
at
Limmeridge
House
at
a
few
hours
'
notice
,
and
in
Mr.
Fairlie
's
present
temper
of
mind
they
might
count
on
the
immediate
exertion
of
his
local
influence
and
authority
to
assist
them
.
<EOS>
The
commonest
consideration
for
Lady
Glyde
's
safety
forced
on
Miss
Halcombe
<EOS>
the
necessity
of
resigning
the
struggle
to
do
her
justice
,
and
of
removing
her
at
once
from
the
place
of
all
others
that
was
now
most
dangerous
to
her
 
the
neighbourhood
of
her
own
home
.
  
<EOS>
An
immediate
return
to
London
was
the
first
and
wisest
measure
of
security
which
suggested
itself
.
<EOS>
In
the
great
city
all
traces
of
them
might
be
most
speedily
and
most
surely
effaced
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
preparations
to
make
 
no
farewell
words
of
kindness
to
exchange
with
any
one
.
<EOS>
On
the
afternoon
of
that
memorable
day
of
the
sixteenth
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
roused
her
sister
to
a
last
exertion
of
courage
,
and
without
a
living
soul
to
wish
them
well
at
parting
,
the
two
took
their
way
into
the
world
alone
,
and
turned
their
backs
for
ever
on
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
passed
the
hill
above
the
churchyard
,
when
Lady
Glyde
insisted
on
turning
back
to
look
her
last
at
her
mother
's
grave
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
tried
to
shake
her
resolution
,
but
,
in
this
one
instance
,
tried
in
vain
.
<EOS>
She
was
immovable
.
<EOS>
Her
dim
eyes
lit
with
a
sudden
fire
,
and
flashed
through
the
veil
that
hung
over
them
 
her
wasted
fingers
strengthened
moment
by
moment
round
the
friendly
arm
by
which
they
had
held
so
listlessly
till
this
time
.
<EOS>
I
believe
in
my
soul
that
the
hand
of
God
was
pointing
their
way
back
to
them
,
and
that
the
most
innocent
and
the
most
afflicted
of
His
creatures
was
chosen
in
that
dread
moment
to
see
it
.
  
<EOS>
They
retraced
their
steps
to
the
burial
-
ground
,
and
by
that
act
sealed
the
future
of
our
three
lives
.
    
<EOS>
This
was
the
story
of
the
past
 
the
story
so
far
as
we
knew
it
then
.
  
<EOS>
Two
obvious
conclusions
presented
themselves
to
my
mind
after
hearing
it
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
I
saw
darkly
what
the
nature
of
the
conspiracy
had
been
,
how
chances
had
been
watched
,
and
how
circumstances
had
been
handled
to
ensure
impunity
to
a
daring
and
an
intricate
crime
.
<EOS>
While
all
details
were
still
a
mystery
to
me
,
the
vile
manner
in
which
the
personal
resemblance
between
the
woman
in
white
and
Lady
Glyde
had
been
turned
to
account
was
clear
beyond
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
It
was
plain
that
Anne
Catherick
had
been
introduced
into
Count
Fosco
's
house
as
Lady
Glyde
 
<EOS>
it
was
plain
that
Lady
Glyde
had
taken
the
dead
woman
's
place
in
the
Asylum
 
<EOS>
the
substitution
having
been
so
managed
as
to
make
innocent
people
(
the
doctor
and
the
two
servants
certainly
,
and
the
owner
of
the
mad
-
house
in
all
probability
)
accomplices
in
the
crime
.
  
<EOS>
The
second
conclusion
came
as
the
necessary
consequence
of
the
first
.
<EOS>
We
three
had
no
mercy
to
expect
from
Count
Fosco
and
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
The
success
of
the
conspiracy
had
brought
with
it
a
clear
gain
to
those
two
men
of
thirty
thousand
pounds
 
twenty
thousand
to
one
,
ten
thousand
to
the
other
through
his
wife
.
<EOS>
They
had
that
interest
,
as
well
as
other
interests
,
in
ensuring
their
impunity
from
exposure
,
and
they
would
leave
no
stone
unturned
,
no
sacrifice
unattempted
,
no
treachery
untried
,
to
discover
the
place
in
which
their
victim
was
concealed
,
and
to
part
her
from
the
only
friends
she
had
in
the
world
 
Marian
Halcombe
and
myself
.
  
<EOS>
The
sense
of
this
serious
peril
 
<EOS>
a
peril
which
every
day
and
every
hour
might
bring
nearer
and
nearer
to
us
 
was
the
one
influence
that
guided
me
in
fixing
the
place
of
our
retreat
.
<EOS>
I
chose
it
in
the
far
east
of
London
,
where
there
were
fewest
idle
people
to
lounge
and
look
about
them
in
the
streets
.
<EOS>
I
chose
it
in
a
poor
and
a
populous
neighbourhood
 
because
the
harder
the
struggle
for
existence
among
the
men
and
women
about
us
,
the
less
the
risk
of
their
having
the
time
or
taking
the
pains
to
notice
chance
strangers
who
came
among
them
.
<EOS>
These
were
the
great
advantages
I
looked
to
,
but
our
locality
was
a
gain
to
us
also
in
another
and
a
hardly
less
important
respect
.
<EOS>
We
could
live
cheaply
by
the
daily
work
of
my
hands
,
and
could
save
every
farthing
we
possessed
to
forward
the
purpose
,
the
righteous
purpose
,
of
redressing
an
infamous
wrong
 
which
,
from
first
to
last
,
I
now
kept
steadily
in
view
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
week
's
time
Marian
Halcombe
<EOS>
and
I
had
settled
how
the
course
of
our
new
lives
should
be
directed
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
no
other
lodgers
in
the
house
,
and
we
had
the
means
of
going
in
and
out
without
passing
through
the
shop
.
<EOS>
I
arranged
,
for
the
present
at
least
,
that
neither
Marian
nor
Laura
should
stir
outside
the
door
without
my
being
with
them
,
and
that
in
my
absence
from
home
they
should
let
no
one
into
their
rooms
on
any
pretence
whatever
.
<EOS>
This
rule
established
,
I
went
to
a
friend
whom
I
had
known
in
former
days
 
<EOS>
a
wood
engraver
in
large
practice
 
to
seek
for
employment
,
telling
him
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
I
had
reasons
for
wishing
to
remain
unknown
.
  
<EOS>
He
at
once
concluded
that
I
was
in
debt
,
expressed
his
regret
in
the
usual
forms
,
and
then
promised
to
do
what
he
could
to
assist
me
.
<EOS>
I
left
his
false
impression
undisturbed
,
and
accepted
the
work
he
had
to
give
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
could
trust
my
experience
and
my
industry
.
<EOS>
I
had
what
he
wanted
,
steadiness
and
facility
,
and
though
my
earnings
were
but
small
,
they
sufficed
for
our
necessities
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
we
could
feel
certain
of
this
,
Marian
Halcombe
and
I
put
together
what
we
possessed
.
<EOS>
She
had
between
two
and
three
hundred
pounds
left
of
her
own
property
,
and
I
had
nearly
as
much
remaining
from
the
purchase
-
money
obtained
by
the
sale
of
my
drawing
-
master
's
practice
before
I
left
England
.
<EOS>
Together
we
made
up
between
us
more
than
four
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
I
deposited
this
little
fortune
in
a
bank
,
to
be
kept
for
the
expense
of
those
secret
inquiries
and
investigations
which
I
was
determined
to
set
on
foot
,
and
to
carry
on
by
myself
if
I
could
find
no
one
to
help
me
.
<EOS>
We
calculated
our
weekly
expenditure
to
the
last
farthing
,
and
we
never
touched
our
little
fund
except
in
Laura
's
interests
and
for
Laura
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
The
house
-
work
,
which
,
if
we
had
dared
trust
a
stranger
near
us
,
would
have
been
done
by
a
servant
,
was
taken
on
the
first
day
,
taken
as
her
own
right
,
by
Marian
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
woman
's
hands
ARE
fit
for
,
"
she
said
,
"
early
and
late
,
these
hands
of
mine
shall
do
.
"
<EOS>
They
trembled
as
she
held
them
out
.
<EOS>
The
wasted
arms
told
their
sad
story
of
the
past
,
as
she
turned
up
the
sleeves
of
the
poor
plain
dress
that
she
wore
for
safety
's
sake
;
but
the
unquenchable
spirit
of
the
woman
burnt
bright
in
her
even
yet
.
<EOS>
I
saw
the
big
tears
rise
thick
in
her
eyes
,
and
fall
slowly
over
her
cheeks
as
she
looked
at
me
.
<EOS>
She
dashed
them
away
with
a
touch
of
her
old
energy
,
and
smiled
with
a
faint
reflection
of
her
old
good
spirits
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
doubt
my
courage
,
Walter
,
"
she
pleaded
,
"
it
's
my
weakness
that
cries
,
not
ME
.
<EOS>
The
house
-
work
shall
conquer
it
if
I
ca
n't
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
kept
her
word
 
<EOS>
the
victory
was
won
when
we
met
in
the
evening
,
and
she
sat
down
to
rest
.
<EOS>
Her
large
steady
black
eyes
looked
at
me
with
a
flash
of
their
bright
firmness
of
bygone
days
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
quite
broken
down
yet
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
worth
trusting
with
my
share
of
the
work
.
<EOS>
"
Before
I
could
answer
,
she
added
in
a
whisper
,
"
And
worth
trusting
with
my
share
in
the
risk
and
the
danger
too
.
<EOS>
Remember
that
,
if
the
time
comes
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
did
remember
it
when
the
time
came
.
  
<EOS>
As
early
as
the
end
of
October
the
daily
course
of
our
lives
had
assumed
its
settled
direction
,
and
we
three
were
as
completely
isolated
in
our
place
of
concealment
as
if
the
house
we
lived
in
had
been
a
desert
island
,
and
the
great
network
of
streets
and
the
thousands
of
our
fellow
-
creatures
all
round
us
the
waters
of
an
illimitable
sea
.
<EOS>
I
could
now
reckon
on
some
leisure
time
for
considering
what
my
future
plan
of
action
should
be
,
and
how
I
might
arm
myself
most
securely
at
the
outset
for
the
coming
struggle
with
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
I
gave
up
all
hope
of
appealing
to
my
recognition
of
Laura
,
or
to
Marian
's
recognition
of
her
,
in
proof
of
her
identity
.
<EOS>
If
we
had
loved
her
less
dearly
,
if
the
instinct
implanted
in
us
by
that
love
had
not
been
far
more
certain
than
any
exercise
of
reasoning
,
far
keener
than
any
process
of
observation
,
even
we
might
have
hesitated
on
first
seeing
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
outward
changes
wrought
by
the
suffering
and
the
terror
of
the
past
had
fearfully
,
almost
hopelessly
,
strengthened
the
fatal
resemblance
between
Anne
Catherick
and
herself
.
<EOS>
In
my
narrative
of
events
at
the
time
of
my
residence
in
Limmeridge
House
,
I
have
recorded
,
from
my
own
observation
of
the
two
,
how
the
likeness
,
striking
as
it
was
when
viewed
generally
,
failed
in
many
important
points
of
similarity
when
tested
in
detail
.
<EOS>
In
those
former
days
,
if
they
had
both
been
seen
together
side
by
side
,
no
person
could
for
a
moment
have
mistaken
them
one
for
the
other
 
as
has
happened
often
in
the
instances
of
twins
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
say
this
now
.
<EOS>
The
sorrow
and
suffering
which
I
had
once
blamed
myself
for
associating
even
by
a
passing
thought
with
the
future
of
Laura
Fairlie
,
HAD
set
their
profaning
marks
on
the
youth
and
beauty
of
her
face
;
and
the
fatal
resemblance
which
I
had
once
seen
and
shuddered
at
seeing
,
in
idea
only
,
was
now
a
real
and
living
resemblance
which
asserted
itself
before
my
own
eyes
.
<EOS>
Strangers
,
acquaintances
,
friends
even
who
could
not
look
at
her
as
we
looked
,
if
she
had
been
shown
to
them
in
the
first
days
of
her
rescue
from
the
Asylum
,
might
have
doubted
if
she
were
the
Laura
Fairlie
they
had
once
seen
,
and
doubted
without
blame
.
  
<EOS>
The
one
remaining
chance
,
which
I
had
at
first
thought
might
be
trusted
to
serve
us
 
<EOS>
the
chance
of
appealing
to
her
recollection
of
persons
and
events
with
which
no
impostor
could
be
familiar
,
was
proved
,
by
the
sad
test
of
our
later
experience
,
to
be
hopeless
.
<EOS>
Every
little
caution
that
Marian
and
I
practised
towards
her
 
every
little
remedy
we
tried
,
to
strengthen
and
steady
slowly
the
weakened
,
shaken
faculties
,
was
a
fresh
protest
in
itself
against
the
risk
of
turning
her
mind
back
on
the
troubled
and
the
terrible
past
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
events
of
former
days
which
we
ventured
on
encouraging
her
to
recall
were
the
little
trivial
domestic
events
of
that
happy
time
at
Limmeridge
,
when
I
first
went
there
and
taught
her
to
draw
.
<EOS>
The
day
when
I
roused
those
remembrances
by
showing
her
the
sketch
of
the
summer
-
house
which
she
had
given
me
on
the
morning
of
our
farewell
,
and
which
had
never
been
separated
from
me
since
,
was
the
birthday
of
our
first
hope
.
<EOS>
Tenderly
and
gradually
,
the
memory
of
the
old
walks
and
drives
dawned
upon
her
,
and
the
poor
weary
pining
eyes
looked
at
Marian
and
at
me
with
a
new
interest
,
with
a
faltering
thoughtfulness
in
them
,
which
from
that
moment
we
cherished
and
kept
alive
.
<EOS>
I
bought
her
a
little
box
of
colours
,
and
a
sketch
-
book
like
the
old
sketch
-
book
which
I
had
seen
in
her
hands
on
the
morning
that
we
first
met
.
<EOS>
Once
again
 
<EOS>
oh
me
,
once
again
!
 
<EOS>
at
spare
hours
saved
from
my
work
,
in
the
dull
London
light
,
in
the
poor
London
room
,
I
sat
by
her
side
to
guide
the
faltering
touch
,
to
help
the
feeble
hand
.
<EOS>
Day
by
day
I
raised
and
raised
the
new
interest
till
its
place
in
the
blank
of
her
existence
was
at
last
assured
 
till
she
could
think
of
her
drawing
and
talk
of
it
,
and
patiently
practise
it
by
herself
,
with
some
faint
reflection
of
the
innocent
pleasure
in
my
encouragement
,
the
growing
enjoyment
in
her
own
progress
,
which
belonged
to
the
lost
life
and
the
lost
happiness
of
past
days
.
  
<EOS>
We
helped
her
mind
slowly
by
this
simple
means
,
we
took
her
out
between
us
to
walk
on
fine
days
,
in
a
quiet
old
City
square
near
at
hand
,
where
there
was
nothing
to
confuse
or
alarm
her
 
<EOS>
we
spared
a
few
pounds
from
the
fund
at
the
banker
's
to
get
her
wine
,
and
the
delicate
strengthening
food
that
she
required
 
we
amused
her
in
the
evenings
with
children
's
games
at
cards
,
with
scrap
-
books
full
of
prints
which
I
borrowed
from
the
engraver
who
employed
me
 
by
these
,
and
other
trifling
attentions
like
them
<EOS>
,
we
composed
her
and
steadied
her
,
and
hoped
all
things
,
as
cheerfully
as
we
could
from
time
and
care
,
and
love
that
never
neglected
and
never
despaired
of
her
.
<EOS>
But
to
take
her
mercilessly
from
seclusion
and
repose
 
to
confront
her
with
strangers
,
or
with
acquaintances
who
were
little
better
than
strangers
 
to
rouse
the
painful
impressions
of
her
past
life
which
we
had
so
carefully
hushed
to
rest
 
this
,
even
in
her
own
interests
,
we
dared
not
do
.
<EOS>
Whatever
sacrifices
it
cost
,
whatever
long
,
weary
,
heartbreaking
delays
it
involved
,
the
wrong
that
had
been
inflicted
on
her
,
if
mortal
means
could
grapple
it
,
must
be
redressed
without
her
knowledge
and
without
her
help
.
  
<EOS>
This
resolution
settled
,
it
was
next
necessary
to
decide
how
the
first
risk
should
be
ventured
,
and
what
the
first
proceedings
should
be
.
  
<EOS>
After
consulting
with
Marian
,
I
resolved
to
begin
by
gathering
together
as
many
facts
as
could
be
collected
 
then
to
ask
the
advice
of
Mr.
Kyrle
(
whom
we
knew
we
could
trust
)
,
and
to
ascertain
from
him
,
in
the
first
instance
,
if
the
legal
remedy
lay
fairly
within
our
reach
.
<EOS>
I
owed
it
to
Laura
's
interests
not
to
stake
her
whole
future
on
my
own
unaided
exertions
,
so
long
as
there
was
the
faintest
prospect
of
strengthening
our
position
by
obtaining
reliable
assistance
of
any
kind
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
source
of
information
to
which
I
applied
was
the
journal
kept
at
Blackwater
Park
by
Marian
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
There
were
passages
in
this
diary
relating
to
myself
which
she
thought
it
best
that
I
should
not
see
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
she
read
to
me
from
the
manuscript
,
and
I
took
the
notes
I
wanted
as
she
went
on
.
<EOS>
We
could
only
find
time
to
pursue
this
occupation
by
sitting
up
late
at
night
.
<EOS>
Three
nights
were
devoted
to
the
purpose
,
and
were
enough
to
put
me
in
possession
of
all
that
Marian
could
tell
.
  
<EOS>
My
next
proceeding
was
to
gain
as
much
additional
evidence
as
I
could
procure
from
other
people
without
exciting
suspicion
.
<EOS>
I
went
myself
to
Mrs.
Vesey
to
ascertain
if
Laura
's
impression
of
having
slept
there
was
correct
or
not
.
<EOS>
In
this
case
,
from
consideration
for
Mrs.
Vesey
's
age
and
infirmity
,
and
in
all
subsequent
cases
of
the
same
kind
from
considerations
of
caution
,
I
kept
our
real
position
a
secret
,
and
was
always
careful
to
speak
of
Laura
as
"
the
late
Lady
Glyde
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vesey
's
answer
to
my
inquiries
only
confirmed
the
apprehensions
which
I
had
previously
felt
.
<EOS>
Laura
had
certainly
written
to
say
she
would
pass
the
night
under
the
roof
of
her
old
friend
 
<EOS>
but
she
had
never
been
near
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Her
mind
in
this
instance
,
and
<EOS>
,
as
I
feared
,
in
other
instances
besides
,
confusedly
presented
to
her
something
which
she
had
only
intended
to
do
in
the
false
light
of
something
which
she
had
really
done
.
<EOS>
The
unconscious
contradiction
of
herself
was
easy
to
account
for
in
this
way
 
but
it
was
likely
to
lead
to
serious
results
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
stumble
on
the
threshold
at
starting
 
<EOS>
it
was
a
flaw
in
the
evidence
which
told
fatally
against
us
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
next
asked
for
the
letter
which
Laura
had
written
to
Mrs.
Vesey
from
Blackwater
Park
,
it
was
given
to
me
without
the
envelope
,
which
had
been
thrown
into
the
wastepaper
basket
,
and
long
since
destroyed
.
<EOS>
In
the
letter
itself
no
date
was
mentioned
 
not
even
the
day
of
the
week
.
<EOS>
It
only
contained
these
lines
:
 
"
Dearest
Mrs.
Vesey
,
I
am
in
sad
distress
and
anxiety
,
and
I
may
come
to
your
house
to
-
morrow
night
,
and
ask
for
a
bed
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
tell
you
what
is
the
matter
in
this
letter
 
<EOS>
I
write
it
in
such
fear
of
being
found
out
that
I
can
fix
my
mind
on
nothing
.
<EOS>
Pray
be
at
home
to
see
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
a
thousand
kisses
,
and
tell
you
everything
.
<EOS>
Your
affectionate
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
What
help
was
there
in
those
lines
?
<EOS>
None
.
  
<EOS>
On
returning
from
Mrs.
Vesey
's
,
I
instructed
Marian
to
write
(
observing
the
same
caution
which
I
practised
myself
)
to
Mrs.
Michelson
.
<EOS>
She
was
to
express
,
if
she
pleased
,
some
general
suspicion
of
Count
Fosco
's
conduct
,
and
she
was
to
ask
the
housekeeper
to
supply
us
with
a
plain
statement
of
events
,
in
the
interests
of
truth
.
<EOS>
While
we
were
waiting
for
the
answer
,
which
reached
us
in
a
week
's
time
,
I
went
to
the
doctor
in
St.
John
's
Wood
,
introducing
myself
as
sent
by
Miss
Halcombe
to
collect
,
if
possible
,
more
particulars
of
her
sister
's
last
illness
than
Mr.
Kyrle
had
found
the
time
to
procure
.
<EOS>
By
Mr.
Goodricke
's
assistance
,
I
obtained
a
copy
of
the
certificate
of
death
,
and
an
interview
with
the
woman
(
Jane
Gould
)
who
had
been
employed
to
prepare
the
body
for
the
grave
.
<EOS>
Through
this
person
I
also
discovered
a
means
of
communicating
with
the
servant
,
Hester
Pinhorn
.
<EOS>
She
had
recently
left
her
place
in
consequence
of
a
disagreement
with
her
mistress
,
and
she
was
lodging
with
some
people
in
the
neighbourhood
whom
Mrs.
Gould
knew
.
<EOS>
In
the
manner
here
indicated
I
obtained
the
Narratives
of
the
housekeeper
,
of
the
doctor
,
of
Jane
Gould
,
and
of
Hester
Pinhorn
,
exactly
as
they
are
presented
in
these
pages
.
  
<EOS>
Furnished
with
such
additional
evidence
as
these
documents
afforded
,
I
considered
myself
to
be
sufficiently
prepared
for
a
consultation
with
Mr.
Kyrle
,
and
Marian
wrote
accordingly
to
mention
my
name
to
him
,
and
to
specify
the
day
and
hour
at
which
I
requested
to
see
him
on
private
business
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
time
enough
in
the
morning
for
me
to
take
Laura
out
for
her
walk
as
usual
,
and
to
see
her
quietly
settled
at
her
drawing
afterwards
.
<EOS>
She
looked
up
at
me
with
a
new
anxiety
in
her
face
as
I
rose
to
leave
the
room
,
and
her
fingers
began
to
toy
doubtfully
,
in
the
old
way
,
with
the
brushes
and
pencils
on
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
tired
of
me
yet
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
going
away
because
you
are
tired
of
me
?
<EOS>
I
will
try
to
do
better
 
<EOS>
I
will
try
to
get
well
.
<EOS>
Are
you
as
fond
of
me
,
Walter
as
you
used
to
be
,
now
I
am
so
pale
and
thin
,
and
so
slow
in
learning
to
draw
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
spoke
as
a
child
might
have
spoken
,
she
showed
me
her
thoughts
as
a
child
might
have
shown
them
.
<EOS>
I
waited
a
few
minutes
longer
 
waited
to
tell
her
that
she
was
dearer
to
me
now
than
she
had
ever
been
in
the
past
times
.
<EOS>
"
Try
to
get
well
again
,
"
I
said
,
encouraging
the
new
hope
in
the
future
which
I
saw
dawning
in
her
mind
,
"
try
to
get
well
again
,
for
Marian
's
sake
and
for
mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
to
herself
,
returning
to
her
drawing
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
try
,
because
they
are
both
so
fond
of
me
.
"
<EOS>
She
suddenly
looked
up
again
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
gone
long
!
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
get
on
with
my
drawing
,
Walter
,
when
you
are
not
here
to
help
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
soon
be
back
,
my
darling
 
soon
be
back
to
see
how
you
are
getting
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
voice
faltered
a
little
in
spite
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
forced
myself
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
time
,
then
,
for
parting
with
the
self
-
control
which
might
yet
serve
me
in
my
need
before
the
day
was
out
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
opened
the
door
,
I
beckoned
to
Marian
to
follow
me
to
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
It
was
necessary
to
prepare
her
for
a
result
which
I
felt
might
sooner
or
later
follow
my
showing
myself
openly
in
the
streets
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
,
in
all
probability
,
be
back
in
a
few
hours
,
"
I
said
,
"
and
you
will
take
care
,
as
usual
,
to
let
no
one
inside
the
doors
in
my
absence
.
<EOS>
But
if
anything
happens
 
"
  
"
What
can
happen
?
<EOS>
"
she
interposed
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
plainly
,
Walter
,
if
there
is
any
danger
,
and
I
shall
know
how
to
meet
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
only
danger
,
"
I
replied
,
"
is
that
Sir
Percival
Glyde
may
have
been
recalled
to
London
by
the
news
of
Laura
's
escape
.
<EOS>
You
are
aware
that
he
had
me
watched
before
I
left
England
,
and
that
he
probably
knows
me
by
sight
,
although
I
do
n't
know
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
laid
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
looked
at
me
in
anxious
silence
.
<EOS>
I
saw
she
understood
the
serious
risk
that
threatened
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
likely
,
"
I
said
,
"
that
I
shall
be
seen
in
London
again
so
soon
,
either
by
Sir
Percival
himself
or
by
the
persons
in
his
employ
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
barely
possible
that
an
accident
may
happen
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
,
you
will
not
be
alarmed
if
I
fail
to
return
to
-
night
,
and
you
will
satisfy
any
inquiry
of
Laura
's
with
the
best
excuse
that
you
can
make
for
me
?
<EOS>
If
I
find
the
least
reason
to
suspect
that
I
am
watched
,
I
will
take
good
care
that
no
spy
follows
me
back
to
this
house
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
doubt
my
return
,
Marian
,
however
it
may
be
delayed
 
and
fear
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
!
"
<EOS>
she
answered
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
regret
,
Walter
,
that
you
have
only
a
woman
to
help
you
.
"
<EOS>
She
paused
,
and
detained
me
for
a
moment
longer
.
<EOS>
"
Take
care
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
pressing
my
hand
anxiously
 
"
take
care
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
left
her
,
and
set
forth
to
pave
the
way
for
discovery
 
the
dark
and
doubtful
way
,
which
began
at
the
lawyer
's
door
.
    
<EOS>
No
circumstance
of
the
slightest
importance
happened
on
my
way
to
the
offices
of
Messrs.
Gilmore
&
Kyrle
,
in
Chancery
Lane
.
  
<EOS>
While
my
card
was
being
taken
in
to
Mr.
Kyrle
,
a
consideration
occurred
to
me
which
I
deeply
regretted
not
having
thought
of
before
.
<EOS>
The
information
derived
from
Marian
's
diary
made
it
a
matter
of
certainty
that
Count
Fosco
had
opened
her
first
letter
from
Blackwater
Park
to
Mr.
Kyrle
,
and
had
,
by
means
of
his
wife
,
intercepted
the
second
.
<EOS>
He
was
therefore
well
aware
of
the
address
of
the
office
,
and
he
would
naturally
infer
that
if
Marian
wanted
advice
and
assistance
,
after
Laura
's
escape
from
the
Asylum
,
she
would
apply
once
more
to
the
experience
of
Mr.
Kyrle
.
<EOS>
In
this
case
the
office
in
Chancery
Lane
was
the
very
first
place
which
he
and
Sir
Percival
would
cause
to
be
watched
,
and
if
the
same
persons
were
chosen
for
the
purpose
who
had
been
employed
to
follow
me
,
before
my
departure
from
England
,
the
fact
of
my
return
would
in
all
probability
be
ascertained
on
that
very
day
.
<EOS>
I
had
thought
,
generally
,
of
the
chances
of
my
being
recognised
in
the
streets
,
but
the
special
risk
connected
with
the
office
had
never
occurred
to
me
until
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
late
now
to
repair
this
unfortunate
error
in
judgment
 
too
late
to
wish
that
I
had
made
arrangements
for
meeting
the
lawyer
in
some
place
privately
appointed
beforehand
.
<EOS>
I
could
only
resolve
to
be
cautious
on
leaving
Chancery
Lane
,
and
not
to
go
straight
home
again
under
any
circumstances
whatever
.
  
<EOS>
After
waiting
a
few
minutes
I
was
shown
into
Mr.
Kyrle
's
private
room
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
pale
,
thin
,
quiet
,
self
-
possessed
man
,
with
a
very
attentive
eye
,
a
very
low
voice
,
and
a
very
undemonstrative
manner
 
not
(
as
I
judged
)
ready
with
his
sympathy
where
strangers
were
concerned
,
and
not
at
all
easy
to
disturb
in
his
professional
composure
.
<EOS>
A
better
man
for
my
purpose
could
hardly
have
been
found
.
<EOS>
If
he
committed
himself
to
a
decision
at
all
,
and
if
the
decision
was
favourable
,
the
strength
of
our
case
was
as
good
as
proved
from
that
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Before
I
enter
on
the
business
which
brings
me
here
,
"
I
said
,
"
I
ought
to
warn
you
,
Mr.
Kyrle
,
that
the
shortest
statement
I
can
make
of
it
may
occupy
some
little
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
time
is
at
Miss
Halcombe
's
disposal
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Where
any
interests
of
hers
are
concerned
,
I
represent
my
partner
personally
,
as
well
as
professionally
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
request
that
I
should
do
so
,
when
he
ceased
to
take
an
active
part
in
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
inquire
whether
Mr.
Gilmore
is
in
England
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
,
he
is
living
with
his
relatives
in
Germany
.
<EOS>
His
health
has
improved
,
but
the
period
of
his
return
is
still
uncertain
.
"
  
<EOS>
While
we
were
exchanging
these
few
preliminary
words
,
he
had
been
searching
among
the
papers
before
him
,
and
he
now
produced
from
them
a
sealed
letter
.
<EOS>
I
thought
he
was
about
to
hand
the
letter
to
me
,
but
,
apparently
changing
his
mind
,
he
placed
it
by
itself
on
the
table
,
settled
himself
in
his
chair
,
and
silently
waited
to
hear
what
I
had
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
Without
wasting
a
moment
in
prefatory
words
of
any
sort
,
I
entered
on
my
narrative
,
and
put
him
in
full
possession
of
the
events
which
have
already
been
related
in
these
pages
.
  
<EOS>
Lawyer
as
he
was
to
the
very
marrow
of
his
bones
,
I
startled
him
out
of
his
professional
composure
.
<EOS>
Expressions
of
incredulity
and
surprise
,
which
he
could
not
repress
,
interrupted
me
several
times
before
I
had
done
.
<EOS>
I
persevered
,
however
,
to
the
end
,
and
as
soon
as
I
reached
it
,
boldly
asked
the
one
important
question
    
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
opinion
,
Mr.
Kyrle
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
too
cautious
to
commit
himself
to
an
answer
without
taking
time
to
recover
his
self
-
possession
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
Before
I
give
my
opinion
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
must
beg
permission
to
clear
the
ground
by
a
few
questions
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
the
questions
 
sharp
,
suspicious
,
unbelieving
questions
,
which
clearly
showed
me
,
as
they
proceeded
,
that
he
thought
I
was
the
victim
of
a
delusion
,
and
that
he
might
even
have
doubted
,
but
for
my
introduction
to
him
by
Miss
Halcombe
,
whether
I
was
not
attempting
the
perpetration
of
a
cunningly
-
designed
fraud
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
believe
that
I
have
spoken
the
truth
,
Mr.
Kyrle
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
when
he
had
done
examining
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
far
as
your
own
convictions
are
concerned
,
I
am
certain
you
have
spoken
the
truth
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
highest
esteem
for
Miss
Halcombe
,
and
I
have
therefore
every
reason
to
respect
a
gentleman
whose
mediation
she
trusts
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
I
will
even
go
farther
,
if
you
like
,
and
admit
,
for
courtesy
's
sake
and
for
argument
's
sake
,
that
the
identity
of
Lady
Glyde
as
a
living
person
is
a
proved
fact
to
Miss
Halcombe
and
yourself
.
<EOS>
But
you
come
to
me
for
a
legal
opinion
.
<EOS>
As
a
lawyer
,
and
as
a
lawyer
only
,
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
you
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
that
you
have
not
the
shadow
of
a
case
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
put
it
strongly
,
Mr.
Kyrle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
to
put
it
plainly
as
well
.
<EOS>
The
evidence
of
Lady
Glyde
's
death
is
,
on
the
face
of
it
,
clear
and
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
There
is
her
aunt
's
testimony
to
prove
that
she
came
to
Count
Fosco
's
house
,
that
she
fell
ill
,
and
that
she
died
.
<EOS>
There
is
the
testimony
of
the
medical
certificate
to
prove
the
death
,
and
to
show
that
it
took
place
under
natural
circumstances
.
<EOS>
There
is
the
fact
of
the
funeral
at
Limmeridge
,
and
there
is
the
assertion
of
the
inscription
on
the
tomb
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
case
you
want
to
overthrow
.
<EOS>
What
evidence
have
you
to
support
the
declaration
on
your
side
that
the
person
who
died
and
was
buried
was
not
Lady
Glyde
?
<EOS>
Let
us
run
through
the
main
points
of
your
statement
and
see
what
they
are
worth
.
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
goes
to
a
certain
private
Asylum
,
and
there
sees
a
certain
female
patient
.
<EOS>
It
is
known
that
a
woman
named
Anne
Catherick
,
and
bearing
an
extraordinary
personal
resemblance
to
Lady
Glyde
,
escaped
from
the
Asylum
;
it
is
known
that
the
person
received
there
last
July
was
received
as
Anne
Catherick
brought
back
;
it
is
known
that
the
gentleman
who
brought
her
back
warned
Mr.
Fairlie
that
it
was
part
of
her
insanity
to
be
bent
on
personating
his
dead
niece
;
and
it
is
known
that
she
did
repeatedly
declare
herself
in
the
Asylum
(
where
no
one
believed
her
)
to
be
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
These
are
all
facts
.
<EOS>
What
have
you
to
set
against
them
?
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
's
recognition
of
the
woman
,
which
recognition
after
-
events
invalidate
or
contradict
.
<EOS>
Does
Miss
Halcombe
assert
her
supposed
sister
's
identity
to
the
owner
of
the
Asylum
,
and
take
legal
means
for
rescuing
her
?
<EOS>
No
,
she
secretly
bribes
a
nurse
to
let
her
escape
.
<EOS>
When
the
patient
has
been
released
in
this
doubtful
manner
,
and
is
taken
to
Mr.
Fairlie
,
does
he
recognise
her
?
<EOS>
Is
he
staggered
for
one
instant
in
his
belief
of
his
niece
's
death
?
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Do
the
servants
recognise
her
?
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Is
she
kept
in
the
neighbourhood
to
assert
her
own
identity
,
and
to
stand
the
test
of
further
proceedings
?
<EOS>
No
,
she
is
privately
taken
to
London
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
you
have
recognised
her
also
,
but
you
are
not
a
relative
 
<EOS>
you
are
not
even
an
old
friend
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
The
servants
contradict
you
,
and
Mr.
Fairlie
contradicts
Miss
Halcombe
,
and
the
supposed
Lady
Glyde
contradicts
herself
.
<EOS>
She
declares
she
passed
the
night
in
London
at
a
certain
house
.
<EOS>
Your
own
evidence
shows
that
she
has
never
been
near
that
house
,
and
your
own
admission
is
that
her
condition
of
mind
prevents
you
from
producing
her
anywhere
to
submit
to
investigation
,
and
to
speak
for
herself
.
<EOS>
I
pass
over
minor
points
of
evidence
on
both
sides
to
save
time
,
and
I
ask
you
,
if
this
case
were
to
go
now
into
a
court
of
law
 
to
go
before
a
jury
,
bound
to
take
facts
as
they
reasonably
appear
 
<EOS>
where
are
your
proofs
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
wait
and
collect
myself
before
I
could
answer
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
time
the
story
of
Laura
and
the
story
of
Marian
had
been
presented
to
me
from
a
stranger
's
point
of
view
 
the
first
time
the
terrible
obstacles
that
lay
across
our
path
had
been
made
to
show
themselves
in
their
true
character
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
can
be
no
doubt
,
"
<EOS>
I
said
,
"
that
the
facts
,
as
you
have
stated
them
,
appear
to
tell
against
us
,
but
 
"
  
"
But
you
think
those
facts
can
be
explained
away
,
"
interposed
Mr.
Kyrle
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
tell
you
the
result
of
my
experience
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
When
an
English
jury
has
to
choose
between
a
plain
fact
ON
the
surface
and
a
long
explanation
UNDER
the
surface
,
it
always
takes
the
fact
in
preference
to
the
explanation
.
<EOS>
For
example
,
Lady
Glyde
(
I
call
the
lady
you
represent
by
that
name
for
argument
's
sake
)
declares
she
has
slept
at
a
certain
house
,
and
it
is
proved
that
she
has
not
slept
at
that
house
.
<EOS>
You
explain
this
circumstance
by
entering
into
the
state
of
her
mind
,
and
deducing
from
it
a
metaphysical
conclusion
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
the
conclusion
is
wrong
 
<EOS>
I
only
say
that
the
jury
will
take
the
fact
of
her
contradicting
herself
in
preference
to
any
reason
for
the
contradiction
that
you
can
offer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
is
it
not
possible
,
"
I
urged
,
"
by
dint
of
patience
and
exertion
,
to
discover
additional
evidence
?
<EOS>
Miss
Halcombe
and
I
have
a
few
hundred
pounds
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
me
with
a
half
-
suppressed
pity
,
and
shook
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Consider
the
subject
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
from
your
own
point
of
view
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
right
about
Sir
Percival
Glyde
and
Count
Fosco
(
which
I
do
n't
admit
,
mind
)
,
every
imaginable
difficulty
would
be
thrown
in
the
way
of
your
getting
fresh
evidence
.
<EOS>
Every
obstacle
of
litigation
would
be
raised
 
every
point
in
the
case
would
be
systematically
contested
 
and
by
the
time
we
had
spent
our
thousands
instead
of
our
hundreds
,
the
final
result
would
,
in
all
probability
,
be
against
us
.
<EOS>
Questions
of
identity
,
where
instances
of
personal
resemblance
are
concerned
,
are
,
in
themselves
,
the
hardest
of
all
questions
to
settle
 
the
hardest
,
even
when
they
are
free
from
the
complications
which
beset
the
case
we
are
now
discussing
.
<EOS>
I
really
see
no
prospect
of
throwing
any
light
whatever
on
this
extraordinary
affair
.
<EOS>
Even
if
the
person
buried
in
Limmeridge
churchyard
be
not
Lady
Glyde
,
she
was
,
in
life
,
on
your
own
showing
,
so
like
her
,
that
we
should
gain
nothing
,
if
we
applied
for
the
necessary
authority
to
have
the
body
exhumed
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
there
is
no
case
,
Mr.
Hartright
 
there
is
really
no
case
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
determined
to
believe
that
there
WAS
a
case
,
and
in
that
determination
shifted
my
ground
,
and
appealed
to
him
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
there
not
other
proofs
that
we
might
produce
besides
the
proof
of
identity
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
as
you
are
situated
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
The
simplest
and
surest
of
all
proofs
,
the
proof
by
comparison
of
dates
,
is
,
as
I
understand
,
altogether
out
of
your
reach
.
<EOS>
If
you
could
show
a
discrepancy
between
the
date
of
the
doctor
's
certificate
and
the
date
of
Lady
Glyde
's
journey
to
London
,
the
matter
would
wear
a
totally
different
aspect
,
and
I
should
be
the
first
to
say
,
Let
us
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
date
may
yet
be
recovered
,
Mr.
Kyrle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
day
when
it
is
recovered
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
you
will
have
a
case
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
prospect
,
at
this
moment
,
of
getting
at
it
 
tell
me
,
and
we
shall
see
if
I
can
advise
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
considered
.
<EOS>
The
housekeeper
could
not
help
us
 
Laura
could
not
help
us
 
Marian
could
not
help
us
.
<EOS>
In
all
probability
,
the
only
persons
in
existence
who
knew
the
date
were
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
think
of
no
means
of
ascertaining
the
date
at
present
,
"
I
said
,
"
because
I
can
think
of
no
persons
who
are
sure
to
know
it
,
but
Count
Fosco
and
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Kyrle
's
calmly
attentive
face
relaxed
,
for
the
first
time
,
into
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
With
your
opinion
of
the
conduct
of
those
two
gentlemen
,
"
he
said
,
"
you
do
n't
expect
help
in
that
quarter
,
I
presume
?
<EOS>
If
they
have
combined
to
gain
large
sums
of
money
by
a
conspiracy
,
they
are
not
likely
to
confess
it
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
may
be
forced
to
confess
it
,
Mr.
Kyrle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
whom
?
"
  
"
By
me
.
"
  
We
both
rose
.
<EOS>
He
looked
me
attentively
in
the
face
with
more
appearance
of
interest
than
he
had
shown
yet
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
that
I
had
perplexed
him
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
determined
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
,
no
doubt
,
a
personal
motive
for
proceeding
,
into
which
it
is
not
my
business
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
If
a
case
can
be
produced
in
the
future
,
I
can
only
say
,
my
best
assistance
is
at
your
service
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
I
must
warn
you
,
as
the
money
question
always
enters
into
the
law
question
,
that
I
see
little
hope
,
even
if
you
ultimately
established
the
fact
of
Lady
Glyde
's
being
alive
,
of
recovering
her
fortune
.
<EOS>
The
foreigner
would
probably
leave
the
country
before
proceedings
were
commenced
,
and
Sir
Percival
's
embarrassments
are
numerous
enough
and
pressing
enough
to
transfer
almost
any
sum
of
money
he
may
possess
from
himself
to
his
creditors
.
<EOS>
You
are
of
course
aware
 
<EOS>
"
  
I
stopped
him
at
that
point
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
beg
that
we
may
not
discuss
Lady
Glyde
's
affairs
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
known
anything
about
them
in
former
times
,
and
I
know
nothing
of
them
now
 
except
that
her
fortune
is
lost
.
<EOS>
You
are
right
in
assuming
that
I
have
personal
motives
for
stirring
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
I
wish
those
motives
to
be
always
as
disinterested
as
they
are
at
the
present
moment
 
"
  
He
tried
to
interpose
and
explain
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
little
heated
,
I
suppose
,
by
feeling
that
he
had
doubted
me
,
and
I
went
on
bluntly
,
without
waiting
to
hear
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
shall
be
no
money
motive
,
"
I
said
,
"
no
idea
of
personal
advantage
in
the
service
<EOS>
I
mean
to
render
to
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
cast
out
as
a
stranger
from
the
house
in
which
she
was
born
 
a
lie
which
records
her
death
has
been
written
on
her
mother
's
tomb
 
and
there
are
two
men
,
alive
and
unpunished
,
who
are
responsible
for
it
.
<EOS>
That
house
shall
open
again
to
receive
her
in
the
presence
of
every
soul
who
followed
the
false
funeral
to
the
grave
 
that
lie
shall
be
publicly
erased
from
the
tombstone
by
the
authority
of
the
head
of
the
family
,
and
those
two
men
shall
answer
for
their
crime
to
ME
,
though
the
justice
that
sits
in
tribunals
is
powerless
to
pursue
them
.
<EOS>
I
have
given
my
life
to
that
purpose
,
and
,
alone
as
I
stand
,
if
God
spares
me
,
I
will
accomplish
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
drew
back
towards
his
table
,
and
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
His
face
showed
plainly
that
he
thought
my
delusion
had
got
the
better
of
my
reason
,
and
that
he
considered
it
totally
useless
to
give
me
any
more
advice
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
each
keep
our
opinion
,
Mr.
Kyrle
,
"
I
said
,
"
<EOS>
and
we
must
wait
till
the
events
of
the
future
decide
between
us
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
attention
you
have
given
to
my
statement
.
<EOS>
You
have
shown
me
that
the
legal
remedy
lies
,
in
every
sense
of
the
word
,
beyond
our
means
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
produce
the
law
proof
,
and
we
are
not
rich
enough
to
pay
the
law
expenses
.
<EOS>
It
is
something
gained
to
know
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
bowed
and
walked
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
called
me
back
and
gave
me
the
letter
which
I
had
seen
him
place
on
the
table
by
itself
at
the
beginning
of
our
interview
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
came
by
post
a
few
days
ago
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
will
not
mind
delivering
it
?
<EOS>
Pray
tell
Miss
Halcombe
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
I
sincerely
regret
being
,
thus
far
,
unable
to
help
her
,
except
by
advice
,
which
will
not
be
more
welcome
,
I
am
afraid
,
to
her
than
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
looked
at
the
letter
while
he
was
speaking
.
<EOS>
It
was
addressed
to
"
Miss
Halcombe
.
<EOS>
Care
of
Messrs.
Gilmore
&
Kyrle
,
Chancery
Lane
.
<EOS>
"
The
handwriting
was
quite
unknown
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
On
leaving
the
room
I
asked
one
last
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
happen
to
know
,
"
I
said
,
"
if
Sir
Percival
Glyde
is
still
in
Paris
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
returned
to
London
,
"
replied
Mr.
Kyrle
.
<EOS>
"
At
least
I
heard
so
from
his
solicitor
,
whom
I
met
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
After
that
answer
I
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
On
leaving
the
office
the
first
precaution
to
be
observed
was
to
abstain
from
attracting
attention
by
stopping
to
look
about
me
.
<EOS>
I
walked
towards
one
of
the
quietest
of
the
large
squares
on
the
north
of
Holborn
,
then
suddenly
stopped
and
turned
round
at
a
place
where
a
long
stretch
of
pavement
was
left
behind
me
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
two
men
at
the
corner
of
the
square
who
had
stopped
also
,
and
who
were
standing
talking
together
.
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
reflection
I
turned
back
so
as
to
pass
them
.
<EOS>
One
moved
as
I
came
near
,
and
turned
the
corner
leading
from
the
square
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
The
other
remained
stationary
.
<EOS>
I
looked
at
him
as
I
passed
and
instantly
recognised
one
of
the
men
who
had
watched
me
before
I
left
England
.
  
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
free
to
follow
my
own
instincts
,
I
should
probably
have
begun
by
speaking
to
the
man
,
and
have
ended
by
knocking
him
down
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
bound
to
consider
consequences
.
<EOS>
If
I
once
placed
myself
publicly
in
the
wrong
,
I
put
the
weapons
at
once
into
Sir
Percival
's
hands
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
choice
but
to
oppose
cunning
by
cunning
.
<EOS>
I
turned
into
the
street
down
which
the
second
man
had
disappeared
,
and
passed
him
,
waiting
in
a
doorway
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
stranger
to
me
,
and
I
was
glad
to
make
sure
of
his
personal
appearance
in
case
of
future
annoyance
.
<EOS>
Having
done
this
,
I
again
walked
northward
till
I
reached
the
New
Road
.
<EOS>
There
I
turned
aside
to
the
west
(
having
the
men
behind
me
all
the
time
)
,
and
waited
at
a
point
where
I
knew
myself
to
be
at
some
distance
from
a
cab
-
stand
,
until
a
fast
two
-
wheel
cab
,
empty
,
should
happen
to
pass
me
.
<EOS>
One
passed
in
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
I
jumped
in
and
told
the
man
to
drive
rapidly
towards
Hyde
Park
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
second
fast
cab
for
the
spies
behind
me
.
<EOS>
I
saw
them
dart
across
to
the
other
side
of
the
road
,
to
follow
me
by
running
,
until
a
cab
or
a
cab
-
stand
came
in
their
way
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
the
start
of
them
,
and
when
I
stopped
the
driver
and
got
out
,
they
were
nowhere
in
sight
.
<EOS>
I
crossed
Hyde
Park
and
made
sure
,
on
the
open
ground
,
that
I
was
free
.
<EOS>
When
I
at
last
turned
my
steps
homewards
,
it
was
not
till
many
hours
later
 
not
till
after
dark
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
Marian
waiting
for
me
alone
in
the
little
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
had
persuaded
Laura
to
go
to
rest
,
after
first
promising
to
show
me
her
drawing
the
moment
I
came
in
.
<EOS>
The
poor
little
dim
faint
sketch
 
<EOS>
so
trifling
in
itself
,
so
touching
in
its
associations
 
was
propped
up
carefully
on
the
table
with
two
books
,
and
was
placed
where
the
faint
light
of
the
one
candle
we
allowed
ourselves
might
fall
on
it
to
the
best
advantage
.
<EOS>
I
sat
down
to
look
at
the
drawing
,
and
to
tell
Marian
,
in
whispers
,
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
The
partition
which
divided
us
from
the
next
room
was
so
thin
that
we
could
almost
hear
Laura
's
breathing
,
and
we
might
have
disturbed
her
if
we
had
spoken
aloud
.
  
<EOS>
Marian
preserved
her
composure
while
I
described
my
interview
with
Mr.
Kyrle
.
<EOS>
But
her
face
became
troubled
when
I
spoke
next
of
the
men
who
had
followed
me
from
the
lawyer
's
office
,
and
when
I
told
her
of
the
discovery
of
Sir
Percival
's
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bad
news
,
Walter
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
,
"
the
worst
news
you
could
bring
.
<EOS>
Have
you
nothing
more
to
tell
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
something
to
give
you
,
"
I
replied
,
handing
her
the
note
which
Mr.
Kyrle
had
confided
to
my
care
.
  
<EOS>
She
looked
at
the
address
and
recognised
the
handwriting
instantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
your
correspondent
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Too
well
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
My
correspondent
is
Count
Fosco
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
reply
she
opened
the
note
.
<EOS>
Her
face
flushed
deeply
while
she
read
it
 
her
eyes
brightened
with
anger
as
she
handed
it
to
me
to
read
in
my
turn
.
  
<EOS>
The
note
contained
these
lines
    
"
Impelled
by
honourable
admiration
 
honourable
to
myself
,
honourable
to
you
 
<EOS>
I
write
,
magnificent
Marian
,
in
the
interests
of
your
tranquillity
,
<EOS>
to
say
two
consoling
words
    
"
Fear
nothing
!
  
<EOS>
"
Exercise
your
fine
natural
sense
and
remain
in
retirement
.
<EOS>
Dear
and
admirable
woman
,
invite
no
dangerous
publicity
.
<EOS>
Resignation
is
sublime
 
adopt
it
.
<EOS>
The
modest
repose
of
home
is
eternally
fresh
 
<EOS>
enjoy
it
.
<EOS>
The
storms
of
life
pass
harmless
over
the
valley
of
Seclusion
 
dwell
,
dear
lady
,
in
the
valley
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
this
and
I
authorise
you
to
fear
nothing
.
<EOS>
No
new
calamity
shall
lacerate
your
sensibilities
 
sensibilities
precious
to
me
as
my
own
.
<EOS>
You
shall
not
be
molested
,
the
fair
companion
of
your
retreat
shall
not
be
pursued
.
<EOS>
She
has
found
a
new
asylum
in
your
heart
.
<EOS>
Priceless
asylum
!
 
<EOS>
I
envy
her
and
leave
her
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
last
word
of
affectionate
warning
,
of
paternal
caution
,
and
I
tear
myself
from
the
charm
of
addressing
you
 
I
close
these
fervent
lines
.
  
<EOS>
"
Advance
no
farther
than
you
have
gone
already
,
compromise
no
serious
interests
,
threaten
nobody
.
<EOS>
Do
not
,
I
implore
you
,
force
me
into
action
 
ME
,
the
Man
of
Action
 
when
it
is
the
cherished
object
of
my
ambition
to
be
passive
,
to
restrict
the
vast
reach
of
my
energies
and
my
combinations
for
your
sake
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
rash
friends
,
moderate
their
deplorable
ardour
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Hartright
returns
to
England
,
hold
no
communication
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
walk
on
a
path
of
my
own
,
and
Percival
follows
at
my
heels
.
<EOS>
On
the
day
when
Mr.
Hartright
crosses
that
path
,
he
is
a
lost
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
only
signature
to
these
lines
was
the
initial
letter
F
,
surrounded
by
a
circle
of
intricate
flourishes
.
<EOS>
I
threw
the
letter
on
the
table
with
all
the
contempt
that
I
felt
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
trying
to
frighten
you
 
a
sure
sign
that
he
is
frightened
himself
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
too
genuine
a
woman
to
treat
the
letter
as
I
treated
it
.
<EOS>
The
insolent
familiarity
of
the
language
was
too
much
for
her
self
-
control
.
<EOS>
As
she
looked
at
me
across
the
table
,
her
hands
clenched
themselves
in
her
lap
,
and
the
old
quick
fiery
temper
flamed
out
again
brightly
in
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Walter
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
if
ever
those
two
men
are
at
your
mercy
,
and
if
you
are
obliged
to
spare
one
of
them
,
do
n't
let
it
be
the
Count
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
keep
this
letter
,
Marian
,
to
help
my
memory
when
the
time
comes
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
at
me
attentively
as
I
put
the
letter
away
in
my
pocket
-
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
the
time
comes
?
"
she
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
Can
you
speak
of
the
future
as
if
you
were
certain
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
certain
after
what
you
have
heard
in
Mr.
Kyrle
's
office
,
after
what
has
happened
to
you
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
count
the
time
from
to
-
day
,
Marian
.
<EOS>
All
I
have
done
to
-
day
is
to
ask
another
man
to
act
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
count
from
to
-
morrow
 
"
  
"
Why
from
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
to
-
morrow
I
mean
to
act
for
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
go
to
Blackwater
by
the
first
train
,
and
return
,
I
hope
,
at
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
Blackwater
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
time
to
think
since
I
left
Mr.
Kyrle
.
<EOS>
His
opinion
on
one
point
confirms
my
own
.
<EOS>
We
must
persist
to
the
last
in
hunting
down
the
date
of
Laura
's
journey
.
<EOS>
The
one
weak
point
in
the
conspiracy
,
and
probably
the
one
chance
of
proving
that
she
is
a
living
woman
,
centre
in
the
discovery
of
that
date
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
,
"
said
Marian
,
"
the
discovery
that
Laura
did
not
leave
Blackwater
Park
till
after
the
date
of
her
death
on
the
doctor
's
certificate
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
makes
you
think
it
might
have
been
AFTER
?
<EOS>
Laura
can
tell
us
nothing
of
the
time
she
was
in
London
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
the
owner
of
the
Asylum
told
you
that
she
was
received
there
on
the
twenty
-
seventh
of
July
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
Count
Fosco
's
ability
to
keep
her
in
London
,
and
to
keep
her
insensible
to
all
that
was
passing
around
her
,
more
than
one
night
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
,
she
must
have
started
on
the
twenty
-
sixth
,
and
must
have
come
to
London
one
day
after
the
date
of
her
own
death
on
the
doctor
's
certificate
.
<EOS>
If
we
can
prove
that
date
,
we
prove
our
case
against
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
 
I
see
!
<EOS>
But
how
is
the
proof
to
be
obtained
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Michelson
's
narrative
has
suggested
to
me
two
ways
of
trying
to
obtain
it
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
is
to
question
the
doctor
,
Mr.
Dawson
,
who
must
know
when
he
resumed
his
attendance
at
Blackwater
Park
after
Laura
left
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
other
is
to
make
inquiries
at
the
inn
to
which
Sir
Percival
drove
away
by
himself
at
night
.
<EOS>
We
know
that
his
departure
followed
Laura
's
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
hours
,
and
we
may
get
at
the
date
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
The
attempt
is
at
least
worth
making
,
and
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
am
determined
it
shall
be
made
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
suppose
it
fails
 
I
look
at
the
worst
now
,
Walter
;
but
I
will
look
at
the
best
if
disappointments
come
to
try
us
 
suppose
no
one
can
help
you
at
Blackwater
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
two
men
who
can
help
me
,
and
shall
help
me
in
London
 
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
.
<EOS>
Innocent
people
may
well
forget
the
date
 
<EOS>
but
THEY
are
guilty
,
and
THEY
know
it
.
<EOS>
If
I
fail
everywhere
else
,
I
mean
to
force
a
confession
out
of
one
or
both
of
them
on
my
own
terms
.
<EOS>
"
  
All
the
woman
flushed
up
in
Marian
's
face
as
I
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Begin
with
the
Count
,
"
she
whispered
eagerly
.
"
<EOS>
For
my
sake
,
begin
with
the
Count
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
begin
,
for
Laura
's
sake
,
where
there
is
the
best
chance
of
success
,
"
I
replied
.
  
<EOS>
The
colour
faded
from
her
face
again
,
and
she
shook
her
head
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
,
"
you
are
right
 
<EOS>
it
was
mean
and
miserable
of
me
to
say
that
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
be
patient
,
Walter
,
and
succeed
better
now
than
I
did
in
happier
times
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
a
little
of
my
old
temper
still
left
,
and
it
will
get
the
better
of
me
when
I
think
of
the
Count
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
turn
will
come
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
,
remember
,
there
is
no
weak
place
in
his
life
that
we
know
of
yet
.
<EOS>
"
I
waited
a
little
to
let
her
recover
her
self
-
possession
,
and
then
spoke
the
decisive
words
    
"
Marian
!
<EOS>
There
is
a
weak
place
we
both
know
of
in
Sir
Percival
's
life
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
mean
the
Secret
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
:
the
Secret
.
<EOS>
It
is
our
only
sure
hold
on
him
.
<EOS>
I
can
force
him
from
his
position
of
security
,
I
can
drag
him
and
his
villainy
into
the
face
of
day
,
by
no
other
means
.
<EOS>
Whatever
the
Count
may
have
done
,
Sir
Percival
has
consented
to
the
conspiracy
against
Laura
from
another
motive
besides
the
motive
of
gain
.
<EOS>
You
heard
him
tell
the
Count
that
he
believed
his
wife
knew
enough
to
ruin
him
?
<EOS>
You
heard
him
say
that
he
was
a
lost
man
if
the
secret
of
Anne
Catherick
was
known
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Marian
,
when
our
other
resources
have
failed
us
,
I
mean
to
know
the
Secret
.
<EOS>
My
old
superstition
clings
to
me
,
even
yet
.
<EOS>
I
say
again
the
woman
in
white
is
a
living
influence
in
our
three
lives
.
<EOS>
The
End
is
appointed
 
<EOS>
the
End
is
drawing
us
on
 
and
Anne
Catherick
,
dead
in
her
grave
,
points
the
way
to
it
still
!
"
    
<EOS>
The
story
of
my
first
inquiries
in
Hampshire
is
soon
told
.
  
<EOS>
My
early
departure
from
London
enabled
me
to
reach
Mr.
Dawson
's
house
in
the
forenoon
.
<EOS>
Our
interview
,
so
far
as
the
object
of
my
visit
was
concerned
,
led
to
no
satisfactory
result
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
's
books
certainly
showed
when
he
had
resumed
his
attendance
on
Miss
Halcombe
at
Blackwater
Park
,
but
it
was
not
possible
to
calculate
back
from
this
date
with
any
exactness
,
without
such
help
from
Mrs.
Michelson
as
I
knew
she
was
unable
to
afford
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
say
from
memory
(
who
,
in
similar
cases
,
ever
can
?
)
<EOS>
how
many
days
had
elapsed
between
the
renewal
of
the
doctor
's
attendance
on
his
patient
and
the
previous
departure
of
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
She
was
almost
certain
of
having
mentioned
the
circumstance
of
the
departure
to
Miss
Halcombe
,
on
the
day
after
it
happened
 
<EOS>
but
then
she
was
no
more
able
to
fix
the
date
of
the
day
on
which
this
disclosure
took
place
,
than
to
fix
the
date
of
the
day
before
,
when
Lady
Glyde
had
left
for
London
.
<EOS>
Neither
could
she
calculate
,
with
any
nearer
approach
to
exactness
,
the
time
that
had
passed
from
the
departure
of
her
mistress
,
to
the
period
when
the
undated
letter
from
Madame
Fosco
arrived
.
<EOS>
Lastly
,
as
if
to
complete
the
series
of
difficulties
,
the
doctor
himself
,
having
been
ill
at
the
time
,
had
omitted
to
make
his
usual
entry
of
the
day
of
the
week
and
month
when
the
gardener
from
Blackwater
Park
had
called
on
him
to
deliver
Mrs.
Michelson
's
message
.
  
<EOS>
Hopeless
of
obtaining
assistance
from
Mr.
Dawson
,
I
resolved
to
try
next
if
I
could
establish
the
date
of
Sir
Percival
's
arrival
at
Knowlesbury
.
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
like
a
fatality
!
<EOS>
When
I
reached
Knowlesbury
the
inn
was
shut
up
,
and
bills
were
posted
on
the
walls
.
<EOS>
The
speculation
had
been
a
bad
one
,
as
I
was
informed
,
ever
since
the
time
of
the
railway
.
<EOS>
The
new
hotel
at
the
station
had
gradually
absorbed
the
business
,
and
the
old
inn
(
which
we
knew
to
be
the
inn
at
which
Sir
Percival
had
put
up
)
,
had
been
closed
about
two
months
since
.
<EOS>
The
proprietor
had
left
the
town
with
all
his
goods
and
chattels
,
and
where
he
had
gone
<EOS>
I
could
not
positively
ascertain
from
any
one
.
<EOS>
The
four
people
of
whom
I
inquired
gave
me
four
different
accounts
of
his
plans
and
projects
when
he
left
Knowlesbury
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
still
some
hours
to
spare
before
the
last
train
left
for
London
,
and
I
drove
back
again
in
a
fly
from
the
Knowlesbury
station
to
Blackwater
Park
,
with
the
purpose
of
questioning
the
gardener
and
the
person
who
kept
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
If
they
,
too
,
proved
unable
to
assist
me
,
my
resources
for
the
present
were
at
an
end
,
and
I
might
return
to
town
.
  
<EOS>
I
dismissed
the
fly
a
mile
distant
from
the
park
,
and
getting
my
directions
from
the
driver
,
proceeded
by
myself
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
turned
into
the
lane
from
the
high
-
road
,
I
saw
a
man
,
with
a
carpet
-
bag
,
walking
before
me
rapidly
on
the
way
to
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
little
man
,
dressed
in
shabby
black
,
and
wearing
a
remarkably
large
hat
.
<EOS>
I
set
him
down
(
as
well
as
it
was
possible
to
judge
)
for
a
lawyer
's
clerk
,
and
stopped
at
once
to
widen
the
distance
between
us
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
heard
me
,
and
he
walked
on
out
of
sight
,
without
looking
back
.
<EOS>
When
I
passed
through
the
gates
myself
,
a
little
while
afterwards
,
he
was
not
visible
 
he
had
evidently
gone
on
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
two
women
in
the
lodge
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
was
old
,
the
other
I
knew
at
once
,
by
Marian
's
description
of
her
,
to
be
Margaret
Porcher
.
  
<EOS>
I
asked
first
if
Sir
Percival
was
at
the
Park
,
and
receiving
a
reply
in
the
negative
,
inquired
next
when
he
had
left
it
.
<EOS>
Neither
of
the
women
could
tell
me
more
than
that
he
had
gone
away
in
the
summer
.
<EOS>
I
could
extract
nothing
from
Margaret
Porcher
but
vacant
smiles
and
shakings
of
the
head
.
<EOS>
The
old
woman
was
a
little
more
intelligent
,
and
I
managed
to
lead
her
into
speaking
of
the
manner
of
Sir
Percival
's
departure
,
and
of
the
alarm
that
it
caused
her
.
<EOS>
She
remembered
her
master
calling
her
out
of
bed
,
and
remembered
his
frightening
her
by
swearing
 
but
the
date
at
which
the
occurrence
happened
was
,
as
she
honestly
acknowledged
,
"
quite
beyond
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
On
leaving
the
lodge
I
saw
the
gardener
at
work
not
far
off
.
<EOS>
When
I
first
addressed
him
,
he
looked
at
me
rather
distrustfully
,
but
on
my
using
Mrs.
Michelson
's
name
,
with
a
civil
reference
to
himself
,
he
entered
into
conversation
readily
enough
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
need
to
describe
what
passed
between
us
 
<EOS>
it
ended
,
as
all
my
other
attempts
to
discover
the
date
had
ended
.
<EOS>
The
gardener
knew
that
his
master
had
driven
away
,
at
night
,
"
some
time
in
July
,
the
last
fortnight
or
the
last
ten
days
in
the
month
"
 
and
knew
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
While
we
were
speaking
together
<EOS>
I
saw
the
man
in
black
,
with
the
large
hat
,
come
out
from
the
house
,
and
stand
at
some
little
distance
observing
us
.
  
<EOS>
Certain
suspicions
of
his
errand
at
Blackwater
Park
had
already
crossed
my
mind
.
<EOS>
They
were
now
increased
by
the
gardener
's
inability
(
or
unwillingness
)
to
tell
me
who
the
man
was
,
and
I
determined
to
clear
the
way
before
me
,
if
possible
,
by
speaking
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
plainest
question
I
could
put
as
a
stranger
would
be
to
inquire
if
the
house
was
allowed
to
be
shown
to
visitors
.
<EOS>
I
walked
up
to
the
man
at
once
,
and
accosted
him
in
those
words
.
  
<EOS>
His
look
and
manner
unmistakably
betrayed
that
he
knew
who
I
was
,
and
that
he
wanted
to
irritate
me
into
quarrelling
with
him
.
<EOS>
His
reply
was
insolent
enough
to
have
answered
the
purpose
,
if
I
had
been
less
determined
to
control
myself
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
I
met
him
with
the
most
resolute
politeness
,
apologised
for
my
involuntary
intrusion
(
which
he
called
a
"
trespass
,
"
)
and
left
the
grounds
.
<EOS>
It
was
exactly
as
I
suspected
.
<EOS>
The
recognition
of
me
when
I
left
Mr.
Kyrle
's
office
had
been
evidently
communicated
to
Sir
Percival
Glyde
,
and
the
man
in
black
had
been
sent
to
the
Park
in
anticipation
of
my
making
inquiries
at
the
house
or
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
given
him
the
least
chance
of
lodging
any
sort
of
legal
complaint
against
me
,
the
interference
of
the
local
magistrate
would
no
doubt
have
been
turned
to
account
as
a
clog
on
my
proceedings
,
and
a
means
of
separating
me
from
Marian
and
Laura
for
some
days
at
least
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
prepared
to
be
watched
on
the
way
from
Blackwater
Park
to
the
station
,
exactly
as
I
had
been
watched
in
London
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
not
discover
at
the
time
,
whether
I
was
really
followed
on
this
occasion
or
not
.
<EOS>
The
man
in
black
might
have
had
means
of
tracking
me
at
his
disposal
of
which
I
was
not
aware
,
but
I
certainly
saw
nothing
of
him
,
in
his
own
person
,
either
on
the
way
to
the
station
,
or
afterwards
on
my
arrival
at
the
London
terminus
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
I
reached
home
on
foot
,
taking
the
precaution
,
before
I
approached
our
own
door
,
of
walking
round
by
the
loneliest
street
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
there
stopping
and
looking
back
more
than
once
over
the
open
space
behind
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
first
learnt
to
use
this
stratagem
against
suspected
treachery
in
the
wilds
of
Central
America
 
<EOS>
and
now
I
was
practising
it
again
,
with
the
same
purpose
and
with
even
greater
caution
,
in
the
heart
of
civilised
London
!
  
<EOS>
Nothing
had
happened
to
alarm
Marian
during
my
absence
.
<EOS>
She
asked
eagerly
what
success
I
had
met
with
.
<EOS>
When
I
told
her
she
could
not
conceal
her
surprise
at
the
indifference
with
which
I
spoke
of
the
failure
of
my
investigations
thus
far
.
  
<EOS>
The
truth
was
,
that
the
ill
-
success
of
my
inquiries
had
in
no
sense
daunted
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
pursued
them
as
a
matter
of
duty
,
and
I
had
expected
nothing
from
them
.
<EOS>
In
the
state
of
my
mind
at
that
time
,
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
me
to
know
that
the
struggle
was
now
narrowed
to
a
trial
of
strength
between
myself
and
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
The
vindictive
motive
had
mingled
itself
all
along
with
my
other
and
better
motives
,
and
I
confess
it
was
a
satisfaction
to
me
to
feel
that
the
surest
way
,
the
only
way
left
,
of
serving
Laura
's
cause
,
was
to
fasten
my
hold
firmly
on
the
villain
who
had
married
her
.
  
<EOS>
While
I
acknowledge
that
I
was
not
strong
enough
to
keep
my
motives
above
the
reach
of
this
instinct
of
revenge
,
I
can
honestly
say
something
in
my
own
favour
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
No
base
speculation
on
the
future
relations
of
Laura
and
myself
,
and
on
the
private
and
personal
concessions
which
I
might
force
from
Sir
Percival
if
I
once
had
him
at
my
mercy
,
ever
entered
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
never
said
to
myself
,
"
If
I
do
succeed
,
it
shall
be
one
result
of
my
success
that
I
put
it
out
of
her
husband
's
power
to
take
her
from
me
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
look
at
her
and
think
of
the
future
with
such
thoughts
as
those
.
<EOS>
The
sad
sight
of
the
change
in
her
from
her
former
self
,
made
the
one
interest
of
my
love
an
interest
of
tenderness
and
compassion
which
her
father
or
her
brother
might
have
felt
,
and
which
I
felt
,
God
knows
,
in
my
inmost
heart
.
<EOS>
All
my
hopes
looked
no
farther
on
now
than
to
the
day
of
her
recovery
.
<EOS>
There
,
till
she
was
strong
again
and
happy
again
 
there
,
till
she
could
look
at
me
as
she
had
once
looked
,
and
speak
to
me
as
she
had
once
spoken
 
the
future
of
my
happiest
thoughts
and
my
dearest
wishes
ended
.
  
<EOS>
These
words
are
written
under
no
prompting
of
idle
self
-
contemplation
.
<EOS>
Passages
in
this
narrative
are
soon
to
come
which
will
set
the
minds
of
others
in
judgment
on
my
conduct
.
<EOS>
It
is
right
that
the
best
and
the
worst
of
me
should
be
fairly
balanced
before
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
morning
after
my
return
from
Hampshire
I
took
Marian
upstairs
into
my
working
-
room
,
and
there
laid
before
her
the
plan
that
I
had
matured
thus
far
,
for
mastering
the
one
assailable
point
in
the
life
of
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
  
<EOS>
The
way
to
the
Secret
lay
through
the
mystery
,
hitherto
impenetrable
to
all
of
us
,
of
the
woman
in
white
.
<EOS>
The
approach
to
that
in
its
turn
might
be
gained
by
obtaining
the
assistance
of
Anne
Catherick
's
mother
,
and
the
only
ascertainable
means
of
prevailing
on
Mrs.
Catherick
to
act
or
to
speak
in
the
matter
depended
on
the
chance
of
my
discovering
local
particulars
and
family
particulars
first
of
all
from
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
After
thinking
the
subject
over
carefully
,
I
felt
certain
that
I
could
only
begin
the
new
inquiries
by
placing
myself
in
communication
with
the
faithful
friend
and
protectress
of
Anne
Catherick
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
difficulty
then
was
to
find
Mrs.
Clements
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
indebted
to
Marian
's
quick
perception
for
meeting
this
necessity
at
once
by
the
best
and
simplest
means
.
<EOS>
She
proposed
to
write
to
the
farm
near
Limmeridge
(
Todd
's
Corner
)
,
to
inquire
whether
Mrs.
Clements
had
communicated
with
Mrs.
Todd
during
the
past
few
months
.
<EOS>
How
Mrs.
Clements
had
been
separated
from
Anne
it
was
impossible
for
us
to
say
,
but
that
separation
once
effected
,
it
would
certainly
occur
to
Mrs.
Clements
to
inquire
after
the
missing
woman
in
the
neighbourhood
of
all
others
to
which
she
was
known
to
be
most
attached
 
the
neighbourhood
of
Limmeridge
.
<EOS>
I
saw
directly
that
Marian
's
proposal
offered
us
a
prospect
of
success
,
and
she
wrote
to
Mrs.
Todd
accordingly
by
that
day
's
post
.
  
<EOS>
While
we
were
waiting
for
the
reply
,
I
made
myself
master
of
all
the
information
Marian
could
afford
on
the
subject
of
Sir
Percival
's
family
,
and
of
his
early
life
.
<EOS>
She
could
only
speak
on
these
topics
from
hearsay
,
but
she
was
reasonably
certain
of
the
truth
of
what
little
she
had
to
tell
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
was
an
only
child
.
<EOS>
His
father
,
Sir
Felix
Glyde
,
had
suffered
from
his
birth
under
a
painful
and
incurable
deformity
,
and
had
shunned
all
society
from
his
earliest
years
.
<EOS>
His
sole
happiness
was
in
the
enjoyment
of
music
,
and
he
had
married
a
lady
with
tastes
similar
to
his
own
,
who
was
said
to
be
a
most
accomplished
musician
.
<EOS>
He
inherited
the
Blackwater
property
while
still
a
young
man
.
<EOS>
Neither
he
nor
his
wife
after
taking
possession
,
made
advances
of
any
sort
towards
the
society
of
the
neighbourhood
,
and
no
one
endeavoured
to
tempt
them
into
abandoning
their
reserve
,
with
the
one
disastrous
exception
of
the
rector
of
the
parish
.
  
<EOS>
The
rector
was
the
worst
of
all
innocent
mischief
-
makers
 
an
over
-
zealous
man
.
<EOS>
He
had
heard
that
Sir
Felix
had
left
College
with
the
character
of
being
little
better
than
a
revolutionist
in
politics
and
an
infidel
in
religion
,
and
he
arrived
conscientiously
at
the
conclusion
that
it
was
his
bounden
duty
to
summon
the
lord
of
the
manor
to
hear
sound
views
enunciated
in
the
parish
church
.
<EOS>
Sir
Felix
fiercely
resented
the
clergyman
's
well
-
meant
but
ill
-
directed
interference
,
insulting
him
so
grossly
and
so
publicly
,
that
the
families
in
the
neighbourhood
sent
letters
of
indignant
remonstrance
to
the
Park
,
and
even
the
tenants
of
the
Blackwater
property
expressed
their
opinion
as
strongly
as
they
dared
.
<EOS>
The
baronet
,
who
had
no
country
tastes
of
any
kind
,
and
no
attachment
to
the
estate
or
to
any
one
living
on
it
,
declared
that
society
at
Blackwater
should
never
have
a
second
chance
of
annoying
him
,
and
left
the
place
from
that
moment
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
short
residence
in
London
he
and
his
wife
departed
for
the
Continent
,
and
never
returned
to
England
again
.
<EOS>
They
lived
part
of
the
time
in
France
and
part
in
Germany
 
always
keeping
themselves
in
the
strict
retirement
which
the
morbid
sense
of
his
own
personal
deformity
had
made
a
necessity
to
Sir
Felix
.
<EOS>
Their
son
,
Percival
,
had
been
born
abroad
,
and
had
been
educated
there
by
private
tutors
.
<EOS>
His
mother
was
the
first
of
his
parents
whom
he
lost
.
<EOS>
His
father
had
died
a
few
years
after
her
,
either
in
1825
or
1826
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
had
been
in
England
,
as
a
young
man
,
once
or
twice
before
that
period
,
but
his
acquaintance
with
the
late
Mr.
Fairlie
did
not
begin
till
after
the
time
of
his
father
's
death
.
<EOS>
They
soon
became
very
intimate
,
although
Sir
Percival
was
seldom
,
or
never
,
at
Limmeridge
House
in
those
days
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Frederick
Fairlie
might
have
met
him
once
or
twice
in
Mr.
Philip
Fairlie
's
company
,
but
he
could
have
known
little
of
him
at
that
or
at
any
other
time
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
's
only
intimate
friend
in
the
Fairlie
family
had
been
Laura
's
father
.
  
<EOS>
These
were
all
the
particulars
that
I
could
gain
from
Marian
.
<EOS>
They
suggested
nothing
which
was
useful
to
my
present
purpose
,
but
I
noted
them
down
carefully
,
in
the
event
of
their
proving
to
be
of
importance
at
any
future
period
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Todd
's
reply
(
addressed
,
by
our
own
wish
,
to
a
post
-
office
at
some
distance
from
us
)
had
arrived
at
its
destination
when
I
went
to
apply
for
it
.
<EOS>
The
chances
,
which
had
been
all
against
us
hitherto
,
turned
from
this
moment
in
our
favour
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Todd
's
letter
contained
the
first
item
of
information
of
which
we
were
in
search
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
,
it
appeared
,
had
(
as
we
had
conjectured
)
written
to
Todd
's
Corner
,
asking
pardon
in
the
first
place
for
the
abrupt
manner
in
which
she
and
Anne
had
left
their
friends
at
the
farm
-
house
(
on
the
morning
after
I
had
met
the
woman
in
white
in
Limmeridge
churchyard
)
,
and
then
informing
Mrs.
Todd
of
Anne
's
disappearance
,
and
entreating
that
she
would
cause
inquiries
to
be
made
in
the
neighbourhood
,
on
the
chance
that
the
lost
woman
might
have
strayed
back
to
Limmeridge
.
<EOS>
In
making
this
request
,
Mrs.
Clements
had
been
careful
to
add
to
it
the
address
at
which
she
might
always
be
heard
of
,
and
that
address
Mrs.
Todd
now
transmitted
to
Marian
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
London
,
and
within
half
an
hour
's
walk
of
our
own
lodging
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
words
of
the
proverb
,
I
was
resolved
not
to
let
the
grass
grow
under
my
feet
.
<EOS>
The
next
morning
I
set
forth
to
seek
an
interview
with
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
This
was
my
first
step
forward
in
the
investigation
.
<EOS>
The
story
of
the
desperate
attempt
to
which
I
now
stood
committed
begins
here
.
    
<EOS>
The
address
communicated
by
Mrs.
Todd
took
me
to
a
lodging
-
house
situated
in
a
respectable
street
near
the
Gray
's
Inn
Road
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
knocked
the
door
was
opened
by
Mrs.
Clements
herself
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
appear
to
remember
me
,
and
asked
what
my
business
was
.
<EOS>
I
recalled
to
her
our
meeting
in
Limmeridge
churchyard
at
the
close
of
my
interview
there
with
the
woman
in
white
,
taking
special
care
to
remind
her
that
I
was
the
person
who
assisted
Anne
Catherick
(
as
Anne
had
herself
declared
)
to
escape
the
pursuit
from
the
Asylum
.
<EOS>
This
was
my
only
claim
to
the
confidence
of
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
She
remembered
the
circumstance
the
moment
I
spoke
of
it
,
and
asked
me
into
the
parlour
,
in
the
greatest
anxiety
to
know
if
I
had
brought
her
any
news
of
Anne
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
for
me
to
tell
her
the
whole
truth
without
,
at
the
same
time
,
entering
into
particulars
on
the
subject
of
the
conspiracy
,
which
it
would
have
been
dangerous
to
confide
to
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
I
could
only
abstain
most
carefully
from
raising
any
false
hopes
,
and
then
explain
that
the
object
of
my
visit
was
to
discover
the
persons
who
were
really
responsible
for
Anne
's
disappearance
.
<EOS>
I
even
added
,
so
as
to
exonerate
myself
from
any
after
-
reproach
of
my
own
conscience
,
that
I
entertained
not
the
least
hope
of
being
able
to
trace
her
 
that
I
believed
we
should
never
see
her
alive
again
 
and
that
my
main
interest
in
the
affair
was
to
bring
to
punishment
two
men
whom
I
suspected
to
be
concerned
in
luring
her
away
,
and
at
whose
hands
I
and
some
dear
friends
of
mine
had
suffered
a
grievous
wrong
.
<EOS>
With
this
explanation
I
left
it
to
Mrs.
Clements
to
say
whether
our
interest
in
the
matter
(
whatever
difference
there
might
be
in
the
motives
which
actuated
us
)
was
not
the
same
,
and
whether
she
felt
any
reluctance
to
forward
my
object
by
giving
me
such
information
on
the
subject
of
my
inquiries
as
she
happened
to
possess
.
  
<EOS>
The
poor
woman
was
at
first
too
much
confused
and
agitated
to
understand
thoroughly
what
I
said
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
only
reply
that
I
was
welcome
to
anything
she
could
tell
me
in
return
for
the
kindness
I
had
shown
to
Anne
;
but
as
she
was
not
very
quick
and
ready
,
at
the
best
of
times
,
in
talking
to
strangers
,
she
would
beg
me
to
put
her
in
the
right
way
,
and
to
say
where
I
wished
her
to
begin
.
  
<EOS>
Knowing
by
experience
that
the
plainest
narrative
attainable
from
persons
who
are
not
accustomed
to
arrange
their
ideas
,
is
the
narrative
which
goes
far
enough
back
at
the
beginning
to
avoid
all
impediments
of
retrospection
in
its
course
<EOS>
,
I
asked
Mrs.
Clements
to
tell
me
first
what
had
happened
after
she
had
left
Limmeridge
,
and
so
,
by
watchful
questioning
,
carried
her
on
from
point
to
point
,
till
we
reached
the
period
of
Anne
's
disappearance
.
  
<EOS>
The
substance
of
the
information
which
I
thus
obtained
was
as
follows
:
    
<EOS>
On
leaving
the
farm
at
Todd
's
Corner
,
Mrs.
Clements
and
Anne
had
travelled
that
day
as
far
as
Derby
,
and
had
remained
there
a
week
on
Anne
's
account
.
<EOS>
They
had
then
gone
on
to
London
,
and
had
lived
in
the
lodging
occupied
by
Mrs.
Clements
at
that
time
for
a
month
or
more
,
when
circumstances
connected
with
the
house
and
the
landlord
had
obliged
them
to
change
their
quarters
.
<EOS>
Anne
's
terror
of
being
discovered
in
London
or
its
neighbourhood
,
whenever
they
ventured
to
walk
out
,
had
gradually
communicated
itself
to
Mrs.
Clements
,
and
she
had
determined
on
removing
to
one
of
the
most
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
places
in
England
 
to
the
town
of
Grimsby
in
Lincolnshire
,
where
her
deceased
husband
had
passed
all
his
early
life
.
<EOS>
His
relatives
were
respectable
people
settled
in
the
town
 
they
had
always
treated
Mrs.
Clements
with
great
kindness
,
and
she
thought
it
impossible
to
do
better
than
go
there
and
take
the
advice
of
her
husband
's
friends
.
<EOS>
Anne
would
not
hear
of
returning
to
her
mother
at
Welmingham
,
because
she
had
been
removed
to
the
Asylum
from
that
place
,
and
because
Sir
Percival
would
be
certain
to
go
back
there
and
find
her
again
.
<EOS>
There
was
serious
weight
in
this
objection
,
and
Mrs.
Clements
felt
that
it
was
not
to
be
easily
removed
.
  
<EOS>
At
Grimsby
the
first
serious
symptoms
of
illness
had
shown
themselves
in
Anne
.
<EOS>
They
appeared
soon
after
the
news
of
Lady
Glyde
's
marriage
had
been
made
public
in
the
newspapers
,
and
had
reached
her
through
that
medium
.
  
<EOS>
The
medical
man
who
was
sent
for
to
attend
the
sick
woman
discovered
at
once
that
she
was
suffering
from
a
serious
affection
of
the
heart
.
<EOS>
The
illness
lasted
long
,
left
her
very
weak
,
and
returned
at
intervals
,
though
with
mitigated
severity
,
again
and
again
.
<EOS>
They
remained
at
Grimsby
,
in
consequence
,
during
the
first
half
of
the
new
year
,
and
there
they
might
probably
have
stayed
much
longer
,
but
for
the
sudden
resolution
which
Anne
took
at
this
time
to
venture
back
to
Hampshire
,
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
a
private
interview
with
Lady
Glyde
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
did
all
in
her
power
to
oppose
the
execution
of
this
hazardous
and
unaccountable
project
.
<EOS>
No
explanation
of
her
motives
was
offered
by
Anne
,
except
that
she
believed
the
day
of
her
death
was
not
far
off
,
and
that
she
had
something
on
her
mind
which
must
be
communicated
to
Lady
Glyde
,
at
any
risk
,
in
secret
.
<EOS>
Her
resolution
to
accomplish
this
purpose
was
so
firmly
settled
that
she
declared
her
intention
of
going
to
Hampshire
by
herself
if
Mrs.
Clements
felt
any
unwillingness
to
go
with
her
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
,
on
being
consulted
,
was
of
opinion
that
serious
opposition
to
her
wishes
would
,
in
all
probability
,
produce
another
and
perhaps
a
fatal
fit
of
illness
,
and
Mrs.
Clements
,
under
this
advice
,
yielded
to
necessity
,
and
once
more
,
with
sad
forebodings
of
trouble
and
danger
to
come
,
allowed
Anne
Catherick
to
have
her
own
way
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
journey
from
London
to
<EOS>
Hampshire
Mrs.
Clements
discovered
that
one
of
their
fellow
-
passengers
was
well
acquainted
with
the
neighbourhood
of
Blackwater
,
and
could
give
her
all
the
information
she
needed
on
the
subject
of
localities
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
she
found
out
that
the
only
place
they
could
go
to
,
which
was
not
dangerously
near
to
Sir
Percival
's
residence
,
was
a
large
village
called
Sandon
.
<EOS>
The
distance
here
from
Blackwater
Park
was
between
three
and
four
miles
 
and
that
distance
,
and
back
again
,
Anne
had
walked
on
each
occasion
when
she
had
appeared
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
lake
.
  
<EOS>
For
the
few
days
during
which
they
were
at
Sandon
without
being
discovered
they
had
lived
a
little
away
from
the
village
,
in
the
cottage
of
a
decent
widow
-
woman
who
had
a
bedroom
to
let
,
and
whose
discreet
silence
Mrs.
Clements
had
done
her
best
to
secure
,
for
the
first
week
at
least
.
<EOS>
She
had
also
tried
hard
to
induce
Anne
to
be
content
with
writing
to
Lady
Glyde
,
in
the
first
instance
;
but
the
failure
of
the
warning
contained
in
the
anonymous
letter
sent
to
Limmeridge
had
made
Anne
resolute
to
speak
this
time
,
and
obstinate
in
the
determination
to
go
on
her
errand
alone
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
,
nevertheless
,
followed
her
privately
on
each
occasion
when
she
went
to
the
lake
,
without
,
however
,
venturing
near
enough
to
the
boat
-
house
to
be
witness
of
what
took
place
there
.
<EOS>
When
Anne
returned
for
the
last
time
from
the
dangerous
neighbourhood
,
the
fatigue
of
walking
,
day
after
day
,
distances
which
were
far
too
great
for
her
strength
,
added
to
the
exhausting
effect
of
the
agitation
from
which
she
had
suffered
,
produced
the
result
which
Mrs.
Clements
had
dreaded
all
along
.
<EOS>
The
old
pain
over
the
heart
and
the
other
symptoms
of
the
illness
at
Grimsby
returned
,
and
Anne
was
confined
to
her
bed
in
the
cottage
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
emergency
the
first
necessity
,
as
Mrs.
Clements
knew
by
experience
,
was
to
endeavour
to
quiet
Anne
's
anxiety
of
mind
,
and
for
this
purpose
the
good
woman
went
herself
the
next
day
to
the
lake
,
to
try
if
she
could
find
Lady
Glyde
(
who
would
be
sure
,
as
Anne
said
,
to
take
her
daily
walk
to
the
boat
-
house
)
,
and
prevail
on
her
to
come
back
privately
to
the
cottage
near
Sandon
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
outskirts
of
the
plantation
Mrs.
Clements
encountered
,
not
Lady
Glyde
,
but
a
tall
,
stout
,
elderly
gentleman
,
with
a
book
in
his
hand
 
in
other
words
,
Count
Fosco
.
  
<EOS>
The
Count
,
after
looking
at
her
very
attentively
for
a
moment
,
asked
if
she
expected
to
see
any
one
in
that
place
,
and
added
,
before
she
could
reply
,
that
he
was
waiting
there
with
a
message
from
Lady
Glyde
,
but
that
he
was
not
quite
certain
whether
the
person
then
before
him
answered
the
description
of
the
person
with
whom
he
was
desired
to
communicate
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
this
Mrs.
Clements
at
once
confided
her
errand
to
him
,
and
entreated
that
he
would
help
to
allay
Anne
's
anxiety
by
trusting
his
message
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
Count
most
readily
and
kindly
complied
with
her
request
.
<EOS>
The
message
,
he
said
,
was
a
very
important
one
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
entreated
Anne
and
her
good
friend
to
return
immediately
to
London
,
as
she
felt
certain
that
Sir
Percival
would
discover
them
if
they
remained
any
longer
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Blackwater
.
<EOS>
She
was
herself
going
to
London
in
a
short
time
,
and
if
Mrs.
Clements
and
Anne
would
go
there
first
,
and
would
let
her
know
what
their
address
was
,
they
should
hear
from
her
and
see
her
in
a
fortnight
or
less
.
<EOS>
The
Count
added
that
he
had
already
attempted
to
give
a
friendly
warning
to
Anne
herself
,
but
that
she
had
been
too
much
startled
by
seeing
that
he
was
a
stranger
to
let
him
approach
and
speak
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
To
this
Mrs.
Clements
replied
,
in
the
greatest
alarm
and
distress
,
that
she
asked
nothing
better
than
to
take
Anne
safely
to
London
,
but
that
there
was
no
present
hope
of
removing
her
from
the
dangerous
neighbourhood
,
as
she
lay
ill
in
her
bed
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
The
Count
inquired
if
Mrs.
Clements
had
sent
for
medical
advice
,
and
hearing
that
she
had
hitherto
hesitated
to
do
so
,
from
the
fear
of
making
their
position
publicly
known
in
the
village
,
informed
her
that
he
was
himself
a
medical
man
,
and
that
he
would
go
back
with
her
if
she
pleased
,
and
see
what
could
be
done
for
Anne
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
<EOS>
(
feeling
a
natural
confidence
in
the
Count
,
as
a
person
trusted
with
a
secret
message
from
Lady
Glyde
)
gratefully
accepted
the
offer
,
and
they
went
back
together
to
the
cottage
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
was
asleep
when
they
got
there
.
<EOS>
The
Count
started
at
the
sight
of
her
(
evidently
from
astonishment
at
her
resemblance
to
Lady
Glyde
)
.
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Clements
supposed
that
he
was
only
shocked
to
see
how
ill
she
was
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
allow
her
to
be
awakened
 
<EOS>
he
was
contented
with
putting
questions
to
Mrs.
Clements
about
her
symptoms
,
with
looking
at
her
,
and
with
lightly
touching
her
pulse
.
<EOS>
Sandon
was
a
large
enough
place
to
have
a
grocer
's
and
druggist
's
shop
in
it
,
and
thither
the
Count
went
to
write
his
prescription
and
to
get
the
medicine
made
up
.
<EOS>
He
brought
it
back
himself
,
and
told
Mrs.
Clements
that
the
medicine
was
a
powerful
stimulant
,
and
that
it
would
certainly
give
Anne
strength
to
get
up
and
bear
the
fatigue
of
a
journey
to
London
of
only
a
few
hours
.
<EOS>
The
remedy
was
to
be
administered
at
stated
times
on
that
day
and
on
the
day
after
.
<EOS>
On
the
third
day
she
would
be
well
enough
to
travel
,
and
he
arranged
to
meet
Mrs.
Clements
at
the
Blackwater
station
,
and
to
see
them
off
by
the
midday
train
.
<EOS>
If
they
did
not
appear
he
would
assume
that
Anne
was
worse
,
and
would
proceed
at
once
to
the
cottage
.
  
<EOS>
As
events
turned
out
,
no
such
emergency
as
this
occurred
.
  
<EOS>
This
medicine
had
an
extraordinary
effect
on
Anne
,
and
the
good
results
of
it
were
helped
by
the
assurance
Mrs.
Clements
could
now
give
her
that
she
would
soon
see
Lady
Glyde
in
London
.
<EOS>
At
the
appointed
day
and
time
(
when
they
had
not
been
quite
so
long
as
a
week
in
Hampshire
altogether
)
,
they
arrived
at
the
station
.
<EOS>
The
Count
was
waiting
there
for
them
,
and
was
talking
to
an
elderly
lady
,
who
appeared
to
be
going
to
travel
by
the
train
to
London
also
.
<EOS>
He
most
kindly
assisted
them
,
and
put
them
into
the
carriage
himself
,
begging
Mrs.
Clements
not
to
forget
to
send
her
address
to
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
The
elderly
lady
did
not
travel
in
the
same
compartment
,
and
they
did
not
notice
what
became
of
her
on
reaching
the
London
terminus
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
secured
respectable
lodgings
in
a
quiet
neighbourhood
,
and
then
wrote
,
as
she
had
engaged
to
do
,
to
inform
Lady
Glyde
of
the
address
.
  
<EOS>
A
little
more
than
a
fortnight
passed
,
and
no
answer
came
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
that
time
a
lady
(
the
same
elderly
lady
whom
they
had
seen
at
the
station
)
called
in
a
cab
,
and
said
that
she
came
from
Lady
Glyde
,
who
was
then
at
an
hotel
in
London
,
and
who
wished
to
see
Mrs.
Clements
,
for
the
purpose
of
arranging
a
future
interview
with
Anne
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
expressed
her
willingness
(
Anne
being
present
at
the
time
,
and
entreating
her
to
do
so
)
to
forward
the
object
in
view
,
especially
as
she
was
not
required
to
be
away
from
the
house
for
more
than
half
an
hour
at
the
most
.
<EOS>
She
and
the
elderly
lady
(
clearly
Madame
Fosco
)
then
left
in
the
cab
.
<EOS>
The
lady
stopped
the
cab
,
after
it
had
driven
some
distance
,
at
a
shop
before
they
got
to
the
hotel
,
and
begged
Mrs.
Clements
to
wait
for
her
for
a
few
minutes
while
she
made
a
purchase
that
had
been
forgotten
.
<EOS>
She
never
appeared
again
.
  
<EOS>
After
waiting
some
time
Mrs.
Clements
became
alarmed
,
and
ordered
the
cabman
to
drive
back
to
her
lodgings
.
<EOS>
When
she
got
there
,
after
an
absence
of
rather
more
than
half
an
hour
,
Anne
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
information
to
be
obtained
from
the
people
of
the
house
was
derived
from
the
servant
who
waited
on
the
lodgers
.
<EOS>
She
had
opened
the
door
to
a
boy
from
the
street
,
who
had
left
a
letter
for
"
the
young
woman
who
lived
on
the
second
floor
"
(
the
part
of
the
house
which
Mrs.
Clements
occupied
)
.
<EOS>
The
servant
had
delivered
the
letter
,
had
then
gone
downstairs
,
and
five
minutes
afterwards
had
observed
Anne
open
the
front
door
and
go
out
,
dressed
in
her
bonnet
and
shawl
.
<EOS>
She
had
probably
taken
the
letter
with
her
,
for
it
was
not
to
be
found
,
and
it
was
therefore
impossible
to
tell
what
inducement
had
been
offered
to
make
her
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
must
have
been
a
strong
one
,
for
she
would
never
stir
out
alone
in
London
of
her
own
accord
.
<EOS>
If
Mrs.
Clements
had
not
known
this
by
experience
nothing
would
have
induced
her
to
go
away
in
the
cab
,
even
for
so
short
a
time
as
half
an
hour
only
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
could
collect
her
thoughts
,
the
first
idea
that
naturally
occurred
to
Mrs.
Clements
was
to
go
and
make
inquiries
at
the
Asylum
,
to
which
she
dreaded
that
Anne
had
been
taken
back
.
  
<EOS>
She
went
there
the
next
day
,
having
been
informed
of
the
locality
in
which
the
house
was
situated
by
Anne
herself
.
<EOS>
The
answer
she
received
(
her
application
having
in
all
probability
been
made
a
day
or
two
before
the
false
Anne
Catherick
had
really
been
consigned
to
safe
keeping
in
the
Asylum
)
was
,
that
no
such
person
had
been
brought
back
there
.
<EOS>
She
had
then
written
to
Mrs.
Catherick
at
Welmingham
to
know
if
she
had
seen
or
heard
anything
of
her
daughter
,
and
had
received
an
answer
in
the
negative
.
<EOS>
After
that
reply
had
reached
her
,
she
was
at
the
end
of
her
resources
,
and
perfectly
ignorant
where
else
to
inquire
or
what
else
to
do
.
<EOS>
From
that
time
to
this
she
had
remained
in
total
ignorance
of
the
cause
of
Anne
's
disappearance
and
of
the
end
of
Anne
's
story
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
far
the
information
which
I
had
received
from
Mrs.
Clements
 
though
it
established
facts
of
which
I
had
not
previously
been
aware
 
was
of
a
preliminary
character
only
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
clear
that
the
series
of
deceptions
which
had
removed
Anne
Catherick
to
London
,
and
separated
her
from
Mrs.
Clements
,
had
been
accomplished
solely
by
Count
Fosco
and
the
Countess
,
and
the
question
whether
any
part
of
the
conduct
of
husband
or
wife
had
been
of
a
kind
to
place
either
of
them
within
reach
of
the
law
might
be
well
worthy
of
future
consideration
.
<EOS>
But
the
purpose
I
had
now
in
view
led
me
in
another
direction
than
this
.
<EOS>
The
immediate
object
of
my
visit
to
Mrs.
Clements
was
to
make
some
approach
at
least
to
the
discovery
of
Sir
Percival
's
secret
,
and
she
had
said
nothing
as
yet
which
advanced
me
on
my
way
to
that
important
end
.
<EOS>
I
felt
the
necessity
of
trying
to
awaken
her
recollections
of
other
times
,
persons
,
and
events
than
those
on
which
her
memory
had
hitherto
been
employed
,
and
when
I
next
spoke
I
spoke
with
that
object
indirectly
in
view
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
be
of
any
help
to
you
in
this
sad
calamity
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
All
I
can
do
is
to
feel
heartily
for
your
distress
.
<EOS>
If
Anne
had
been
your
own
child
,
Mrs.
Clements
,
you
could
have
shown
her
no
truer
kindness
 
<EOS>
you
could
have
made
no
readier
sacrifices
for
her
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
great
merit
in
that
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs.
Clements
simply
.
<EOS>
"
The
poor
thing
was
as
good
as
my
own
child
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
nursed
her
from
a
baby
,
sir
,
bringing
her
up
by
hand
 
and
a
hard
job
it
was
to
rear
her
.
<EOS>
It
would
n't
go
to
my
heart
so
to
lose
her
if
I
had
n't
made
her
first
short
clothes
and
taught
her
to
walk
.
<EOS>
I
always
said
she
was
sent
to
console
me
for
never
having
chick
or
child
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
And
now
she
's
lost
the
old
times
keep
coming
back
to
my
mind
,
and
even
at
my
age
I
ca
n't
help
crying
about
her
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
indeed
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
waited
a
little
to
give
Mrs.
Clements
time
to
compose
herself
.
<EOS>
Was
the
light
that
I
had
been
looking
for
so
long
glimmering
on
me
 
far
off
,
as
yet
 
in
the
good
woman
's
recollections
of
Anne
's
early
life
?
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
know
Mrs.
Catherick
before
Anne
was
born
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
very
long
,
sir
 
not
above
four
months
.
<EOS>
We
saw
a
great
deal
of
each
other
in
that
time
,
but
we
were
never
very
friendly
together
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
voice
was
steadier
as
she
made
that
reply
.
<EOS>
Painful
as
many
of
her
recollections
might
be
,
I
observed
that
it
was
unconsciously
a
relief
to
her
mind
to
revert
to
the
dimly
-
seen
troubles
of
the
past
,
after
dwelling
so
long
on
the
vivid
sorrows
of
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
"
Were
you
and
Mrs.
Catherick
neighbours
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
,
leading
her
memory
on
as
encouragingly
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
 
neighbours
at
Old
Welmingham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
OLD
Welmingham
?
<EOS>
There
are
two
places
of
that
name
,
then
,
in
Hampshire
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
there
used
to
be
in
those
days
 
better
than
three
-
and
-
twenty
years
ago
.
<EOS>
They
built
a
new
town
about
two
miles
off
,
convenient
to
the
river
 
and
Old
Welmingham
,
which
was
never
much
more
than
a
village
,
got
in
time
to
be
deserted
.
<EOS>
The
new
town
is
the
place
they
call
Welmingham
now
 
but
<EOS>
the
old
parish
church
is
the
parish
church
still
.
<EOS>
It
stands
by
itself
,
with
the
houses
pulled
down
or
gone
to
ruin
all
round
it
.
<EOS>
I
've
lived
to
see
sad
changes
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
pleasant
,
pretty
place
in
my
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
live
there
before
your
marriage
,
Mrs.
Clements
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
Norfolk
woman
.
<EOS>
It
was
n't
the
place
my
husband
belonged
to
either
.
<EOS>
He
was
from
Grimsby
,
as
I
told
you
,
and
he
served
his
apprenticeship
there
.
<EOS>
But
having
friends
down
south
,
and
hearing
of
an
opening
,
he
got
into
business
at
Southampton
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
a
small
way
,
but
he
made
enough
for
a
plain
man
to
retire
on
,
and
settled
at
Old
Welmingham
.
<EOS>
I
went
there
with
him
when
he
married
me
.
<EOS>
We
were
neither
of
us
young
,
but
we
lived
very
happy
together
 
happier
than
our
neighbour
,
Mr.
Catherick
,
lived
along
with
his
wife
when
they
came
to
Old
Welmingham
a
year
or
two
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
your
husband
acquainted
with
them
before
that
?
"
  
"
With
Catherick
,
sir
 
not
with
his
wife
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
stranger
to
both
of
us
.
<EOS>
Some
gentlemen
had
made
interest
for
Catherick
,
and
he
got
the
situation
of
clerk
at
Welmingham
church
,
which
was
the
reason
of
his
coming
to
settle
in
our
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
He
brought
his
newly
-
married
wife
along
with
him
,
and
we
heard
in
course
of
time
she
had
been
lady's
-
maid
in
a
family
that
lived
at
Varneck
Hall
,
near
Southampton
.
<EOS>
Catherick
had
found
it
a
hard
matter
to
get
her
to
marry
him
,
in
consequence
of
her
holding
herself
uncommonly
high
.
<EOS>
He
had
asked
and
asked
,
and
given
the
thing
up
at
last
,
seeing
she
was
so
contrary
about
it
.
<EOS>
When
he
HAD
given
it
up
<EOS>
she
turned
contrary
just
the
other
way
,
and
came
to
him
of
her
own
accord
,
without
rhyme
or
reason
seemingly
.
<EOS>
My
poor
husband
always
said
that
was
the
time
to
have
given
her
a
lesson
.
<EOS>
But
Catherick
was
too
fond
of
her
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
 
he
never
checked
her
either
before
they
were
married
or
after
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
quick
man
in
his
feelings
,
letting
them
carry
him
a
deal
too
far
,
now
in
one
way
and
now
in
another
,
and
he
would
have
spoilt
a
better
wife
than
Mrs.
Catherick
if
a
better
had
married
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
to
speak
ill
of
any
one
,
sir
,
but
she
was
a
heartless
woman
,
with
a
terrible
will
of
her
own
 
fond
of
foolish
admiration
and
fine
clothes
,
and
not
caring
to
show
so
much
as
decent
outward
respect
to
Catherick
,
kindly
as
he
always
treated
her
.
<EOS>
My
husband
said
he
thought
things
would
turn
out
badly
when
they
first
came
to
live
near
us
,
and
his
words
proved
true
.
<EOS>
Before
they
had
been
quite
four
months
in
our
neighbourhood
there
was
a
dreadful
scandal
and
a
miserable
break
-
up
in
their
household
.
<EOS>
Both
of
them
were
in
fault
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
both
of
them
were
equally
in
fault
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
both
husband
and
wife
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
sir
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
Catherick
 
he
was
only
to
be
pitied
.
<EOS>
I
meant
his
wife
and
the
person
 
"
  
"
And
the
person
who
caused
the
scandal
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
A
gentleman
born
and
brought
up
,
who
ought
to
have
set
a
better
example
.
<EOS>
You
know
him
,
sir
 
and
my
poor
dear
Anne
knew
him
only
too
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Percival
Glyde
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
heart
beat
fast
 
<EOS>
I
thought
I
had
my
hand
on
the
clue
.
<EOS>
How
little
I
knew
then
of
the
windings
of
the
labyrinths
which
were
still
to
mislead
me
!
  
<EOS>
"
Did
Sir
Percival
live
in
your
neighbourhood
at
that
time
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
<EOS>
He
came
among
us
as
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
His
father
had
died
not
long
before
in
foreign
parts
.
<EOS>
I
remember
he
was
in
mourning
.
<EOS>
He
put
up
at
the
little
inn
on
the
river
<EOS>
(
they
have
pulled
it
down
since
that
time
)
,
where
gentlemen
used
to
go
to
fish
.
<EOS>
He
was
n't
much
noticed
when
he
first
came
 
<EOS>
it
was
a
common
thing
enough
for
gentlemen
to
travel
from
all
parts
of
England
to
fish
in
our
river
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Did
he
make
his
appearance
in
the
village
before
Anne
was
born
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Anne
was
born
in
the
June
month
of
eighteen
hundred
and
twenty
-
seven
 
<EOS>
and
I
think
he
came
at
the
end
of
April
or
the
beginning
of
May.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Came
as
a
stranger
to
all
of
you
?
<EOS>
A
stranger
to
Mrs.
Catherick
as
well
as
to
the
rest
of
the
neighbours
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
we
thought
at
first
,
sir
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
scandal
broke
out
,
nobody
believed
they
were
strangers
.
<EOS>
I
remember
how
it
happened
as
well
as
if
it
was
yesterday
.
<EOS>
Catherick
came
into
our
garden
one
night
,
and
woke
us
by
throwing
up
a
handful
of
gravel
from
the
walk
at
our
window
.
<EOS>
I
heard
him
beg
my
husband
,
for
the
Lord
's
sake
,
to
come
down
and
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
They
were
a
long
time
together
talking
in
the
porch
.
<EOS>
When
my
husband
came
back
upstairs
he
was
all
of
a
tremble
.
<EOS>
He
sat
down
on
the
side
of
the
bed
and
he
says
to
me
,
"
Lizzie
!
<EOS>
I
always
told
you
that
woman
was
a
bad
one
 
<EOS>
I
always
said
she
would
end
ill
,
and
I
'm
afraid
in
my
own
mind
that
the
end
has
come
already
.
<EOS>
Catherick
has
found
a
lot
of
lace
handkerchiefs
,
and
two
fine
rings
,
and
a
new
gold
watch
and
chain
,
hid
away
in
his
wife
's
drawer
 
things
that
nobody
but
a
born
lady
ought
ever
to
have
 
and
his
wife
wo
n't
say
how
she
came
by
them
.
"
<EOS>
"
Does
he
think
she
stole
them
?
"
says
I.
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
says
he
,
"
stealing
would
be
bad
enough
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
worse
than
that
,
she
's
had
no
chance
of
stealing
such
things
as
those
,
and
she
's
not
a
woman
to
take
them
if
she
had
.
<EOS>
They
're
gifts
,
Lizzie
 
there
's
her
own
initials
engraved
inside
the
watch
 
and
Catherick
has
seen
her
talking
privately
,
and
carrying
on
as
no
married
woman
should
,
with
that
gentleman
in
mourning
,
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
say
anything
about
it
 
<EOS>
I
've
quieted
Catherick
for
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
I
've
told
him
to
keep
his
tongue
to
himself
,
and
his
eyes
and
his
ears
open
,
and
to
wait
a
day
or
two
,
till
he
can
be
quite
certain
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
are
both
of
you
wrong
,
"
says
I.
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
in
nature
,
comfortable
and
respectable
as
she
is
here
,
that
Mrs.
Catherick
should
take
up
with
a
chance
stranger
like
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
"
<EOS>
'
ay
,
but
is
he
a
stranger
to
her
?
"
says
my
husband
.
<EOS>
"
You
forget
how
Catherick
's
wife
came
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
She
went
to
him
of
her
own
accord
,
after
saying
No
over
and
over
again
when
he
asked
her
.
<EOS>
There
have
been
wicked
women
before
her
time
,
Lizzie
,
who
have
used
honest
men
who
loved
them
as
a
means
of
saving
their
characters
,
and
I
'm
sorely
afraid
this
Mrs.
Catherick
is
as
wicked
as
the
worst
of
them
.
<EOS>
We
shall
see
,
"
says
my
husband
,
"
we
shall
soon
see
.
"
<EOS>
And
only
two
days
afterwards
we
did
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
waited
for
a
moment
before
she
went
on
.
<EOS>
Even
in
that
moment
,
I
began
to
doubt
whether
the
clue
that
I
thought
I
had
found
was
really
leading
me
to
the
central
mystery
of
the
labyrinth
after
all
.
<EOS>
Was
this
common
,
too
common
,
story
of
a
man
's
treachery
and
a
woman
's
frailty
the
key
to
a
secret
which
had
been
the
lifelong
terror
of
Sir
Percival
Glyde
?
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
Catherick
took
my
husband
's
advice
and
waited
,
"
Mrs.
Clements
continued
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
as
I
told
you
,
he
had
n't
long
to
wait
.
<EOS>
On
the
second
day
he
found
his
wife
and
Sir
Percival
whispering
together
quite
familiar
,
close
under
the
vestry
of
the
church
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
thought
the
neighbourhood
of
the
vestry
was
the
last
place
in
the
world
where
anybody
would
think
of
looking
after
them
,
but
,
however
that
may
be
,
there
they
were
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
,
being
seemingly
surprised
and
confounded
,
defended
himself
in
such
a
guilty
way
that
poor
Catherick
(
whose
quick
temper
I
have
told
you
of
already
)
fell
into
a
kind
of
frenzy
at
his
own
disgrace
,
and
struck
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
He
was
no
match
(
and
I
am
sorry
to
say
it
)
for
the
man
who
had
wronged
him
,
and
he
was
beaten
in
the
cruelest
manner
,
before
the
neighbours
,
who
had
come
to
the
place
on
hearing
the
disturbance
,
could
run
in
to
part
them
.
<EOS>
All
this
happened
towards
evening
,
and
before
nightfall
,
when
my
husband
went
to
Catherick
's
house
,
he
was
gone
,
nobody
knew
where
.
<EOS>
No
living
soul
in
the
village
ever
saw
him
again
.
<EOS>
He
knew
too
well
,
by
that
time
,
what
his
wife
's
vile
reason
had
been
for
marrying
him
,
and
he
felt
his
misery
and
disgrace
,
especially
after
what
had
happened
to
him
with
Sir
Percival
,
too
keenly
.
<EOS>
The
clergyman
of
the
parish
put
an
advertisement
in
the
paper
begging
him
to
come
back
,
and
saying
that
he
should
not
lose
his
situation
or
his
friends
.
<EOS>
But
Catherick
had
too
much
pride
and
spirit
,
as
some
people
said
 
too
much
feeling
,
as
I
think
,
sir
 
to
face
his
neighbours
again
,
and
try
to
live
down
the
memory
of
his
disgrace
.
<EOS>
My
husband
heard
from
him
when
he
had
left
England
,
and
heard
a
second
time
,
when
he
was
settled
and
doing
well
in
America
.
<EOS>
He
is
alive
there
now
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
but
none
of
us
in
the
old
country
 
his
wicked
wife
least
of
all
 
are
ever
likely
to
set
eyes
on
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
became
of
Sir
Percival
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Did
he
stay
in
the
neighbourhood
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
he
,
sir
.
<EOS>
The
place
was
too
hot
to
hold
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
heard
at
high
words
with
Mrs.
Catherick
the
same
night
when
the
scandal
broke
out
,
and
the
next
morning
he
took
himself
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Catherick
?
<EOS>
Surely
she
never
remained
in
the
village
among
the
people
who
knew
of
her
disgrace
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
did
,
sir
.
<EOS>
She
was
hard
enough
and
heartless
enough
to
set
the
opinions
of
all
her
neighbours
at
flat
defiance
.
<EOS>
She
declared
to
everybody
,
from
the
clergyman
downwards
,
that
she
was
the
victim
of
a
dreadful
mistake
,
and
that
all
the
scandal
-
mongers
in
the
place
should
not
drive
her
out
of
it
,
as
if
she
was
a
guilty
woman
.
<EOS>
All
through
my
time
she
lived
at
Old
Welmingham
,
and
after
my
time
,
when
the
new
town
was
building
,
and
the
respectable
neighbours
began
moving
to
it
,
she
moved
too
,
as
if
she
was
determined
to
live
among
them
and
scandalise
them
to
the
very
last
.
<EOS>
There
she
is
now
,
and
there
she
will
stop
,
in
defiance
of
the
best
of
them
,
to
her
dying
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
how
has
she
lived
through
all
these
years
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Was
her
husband
able
and
willing
to
help
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Both
able
and
willing
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
"
In
the
second
letter
he
wrote
to
my
good
man
,
he
said
she
had
borne
his
name
,
and
lived
in
his
home
,
and
,
wicked
as
she
was
,
she
must
not
starve
like
a
beggar
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
He
could
afford
to
make
her
some
small
allowance
,
and
she
might
draw
for
it
quarterly
at
a
place
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
she
accept
the
allowance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
farthing
of
it
,
sir
.
<EOS>
She
said
she
would
never
be
beholden
to
Catherick
for
bit
or
drop
,
if
she
lived
to
be
a
hundred
.
<EOS>
And
she
has
kept
her
word
ever
since
.
<EOS>
When
my
poor
dear
husband
died
,
and
left
all
to
me
,
Catherick
's
letter
was
put
in
my
possession
with
the
other
things
,
and
I
told
her
to
let
me
know
if
she
was
ever
in
want
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
let
all
England
know
I
'm
in
want
,
"
she
said
,
"
before
I
tell
Catherick
,
or
any
friend
of
Catherick
's

<EOS>
Take
that
for
your
answer
,
and
give
it
to
HIM
for
an
answer
,
if
he
ever
writes
again
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
suppose
that
she
had
money
of
her
own
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
little
,
if
any
,
sir
.
<EOS>
It
was
said
,
and
said
truly
,
I
am
afraid
,
that
her
means
of
living
came
privately
from
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
that
last
reply
I
waited
a
little
,
to
reconsider
what
I
had
heard
.
<EOS>
If
I
unreservedly
accepted
the
story
so
far
,
it
was
now
plain
that
no
approach
,
direct
or
indirect
,
to
the
Secret
had
yet
been
revealed
to
me
,
and
that
the
pursuit
of
my
object
had
ended
again
in
leaving
me
face
to
face
with
the
most
palpable
and
the
most
disheartening
failure
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
was
one
point
in
the
narrative
which
made
me
doubt
the
propriety
of
accepting
it
unreservedly
,
and
which
suggested
the
idea
of
something
hidden
below
the
surface
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
account
to
myself
for
the
circumstance
of
the
clerk
's
guilty
wife
voluntarily
living
out
all
her
after
-
existence
on
the
scene
of
her
disgrace
.
<EOS>
The
woman
's
own
reported
statement
that
she
had
taken
this
strange
course
as
a
practical
assertion
of
her
innocence
did
not
satisfy
me
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
,
to
my
mind
,
more
natural
and
more
probable
to
assume
that
she
was
not
so
completely
a
free
agent
in
this
matter
as
she
had
herself
asserted
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
,
who
was
the
likeliest
person
to
possess
the
power
of
compelling
her
to
remain
at
Welmingham
?
<EOS>
The
person
unquestionably
from
whom
she
derived
the
means
of
living
.
<EOS>
She
had
refused
assistance
from
her
husband
,
she
had
no
adequate
resources
of
her
own
<EOS>
,
she
was
a
friendless
,
degraded
woman
 
<EOS>
from
what
source
should
she
derive
help
but
from
the
source
at
which
report
pointed
 
Sir
Percival
Glyde
?
  
<EOS>
Reasoning
on
these
assumptions
,
and
always
bearing
in
mind
the
one
certain
fact
to
guide
me
,
that
Mrs.
Catherick
was
in
possession
of
the
Secret
,
I
easily
understood
that
it
was
Sir
Percival
's
interest
to
keep
her
at
Welmingham
,
because
her
character
in
that
place
was
certain
to
isolate
her
from
all
communication
with
female
neighbours
,
and
to
allow
her
no
opportunities
of
talking
incautiously
in
moments
of
free
intercourse
with
inquisitive
bosom
friends
.
<EOS>
But
what
was
the
mystery
to
be
concealed
?
<EOS>
Not
Sir
Percival
's
infamous
connection
with
Mrs.
Catherick
's
disgrace
,
for
the
neighbours
were
the
very
people
who
knew
of
it
 
not
<EOS>
the
suspicion
that
he
was
Anne
's
father
,
for
Welmingham
was
the
place
in
which
that
suspicion
must
inevitably
exist
.
<EOS>
If
I
accepted
the
guilty
appearances
described
to
me
as
unreservedly
as
others
had
accepted
them
,
if
I
drew
from
them
the
same
superficial
conclusion
which
Mr.
Catherick
and
all
his
neighbours
had
drawn
,
where
was
the
suggestion
,
in
all
that
I
had
heard
,
of
a
dangerous
secret
between
Sir
Percival
and
Mrs.
Catherick
,
which
had
been
kept
hidden
from
that
time
to
this
?
  
<EOS>
And
yet
,
in
those
stolen
meetings
,
in
those
familiar
whisperings
between
the
clerk
's
wife
and
"
the
gentleman
in
mourning
,
"
the
clue
to
discovery
existed
beyond
a
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
Was
it
possible
that
appearances
in
this
case
had
pointed
one
way
while
the
truth
lay
all
the
while
unsuspected
in
another
direction
?
<EOS>
Could
Mrs.
Catherick
's
assertion
,
that
she
was
the
victim
of
a
dreadful
mistake
,
by
any
possibility
be
true
?
<EOS>
Or
,
assuming
it
to
be
false
,
could
the
conclusion
which
associated
Sir
Percival
with
her
guilt
have
been
founded
in
some
inconceivable
error
?
<EOS>
Had
Sir
Percival
,
by
any
chance
,
courted
the
suspicion
that
was
wrong
for
the
sake
of
diverting
from
himself
some
other
suspicion
that
was
right
?
<EOS>
Here
 
if
I
could
find
it
 
here
was
the
approach
to
the
Secret
,
hidden
deep
under
the
surface
of
the
apparently
unpromising
story
which
I
had
just
heard
.
  
<EOS>
My
next
questions
were
now
directed
to
the
one
object
of
ascertaining
whether
Mr.
Catherick
had
or
had
not
arrived
truly
at
the
conviction
of
his
wife
's
misconduct
.
<EOS>
The
answers
I
received
from
Mrs.
Clements
left
me
in
no
doubt
whatever
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Catherick
had
,
on
the
clearest
evidence
,
compromised
her
reputation
,
while
a
single
woman
,
with
some
person
unknown
,
and
had
married
to
save
her
character
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
positively
ascertained
,
by
calculations
of
time
and
place
into
which
I
need
not
enter
particularly
,
that
the
daughter
who
bore
her
husband
's
name
was
not
her
husband
's
child
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
object
of
inquiry
,
whether
it
was
equally
certain
that
Sir
Percival
must
have
been
the
father
of
Anne
,
was
beset
by
far
greater
difficulties
.
<EOS>
I
was
in
no
position
to
try
the
probabilities
on
one
side
or
on
the
other
in
this
instance
by
any
better
test
than
the
test
of
personal
resemblance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
often
saw
Sir
Percival
when
he
was
in
your
village
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
very
often
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Clements
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
observe
that
Anne
was
like
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
was
not
at
all
like
him
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
she
like
her
mother
,
then
?
"
  
"
Not
like
her
mother
either
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Catherick
was
dark
,
and
full
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Not
like
her
mother
and
not
like
her
(
supposed
)
father
.
<EOS>
I
knew
that
the
test
by
personal
resemblance
was
not
to
be
implicitly
trusted
,
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
it
was
not
to
be
altogether
rejected
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
Was
it
possible
to
strengthen
the
evidence
by
discovering
any
conclusive
facts
in
relation
to
the
lives
of
Mrs.
Catherick
and
Sir
Percival
before
they
either
of
them
appeared
at
Old
Welmingham
?
<EOS>
When
I
asked
my
next
questions
I
put
them
with
this
view
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
Sir
Percival
first
arrived
in
your
neighbourhood
,
"
I
said
,
"
did
you
hear
where
he
had
come
from
last
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Some
said
from
Blackwater
Park
,
and
some
said
from
Scotland
 
<EOS>
but
nobody
knew
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Was
Mrs.
Catherick
living
in
service
at
Varneck
Hall
immediately
before
her
marriage
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
had
she
been
long
in
her
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Three
or
four
years
,
sir
;
I
am
not
quite
certain
which
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
hear
the
name
of
the
gentleman
to
whom
Varneck
Hall
belonged
at
that
time
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
His
name
was
Major
Donthorne
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
Mr.
Catherick
,
or
did
any
one
else
you
knew
,
ever
hear
that
Sir
Percival
was
a
friend
of
Major
Donthorne
's
,
or
ever
see
Sir
Percival
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Varneck
Hall
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Catherick
never
did
,
sir
,
that
I
can
remember
 
nor
any
one
else
either
,
that
I
know
of
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
noted
down
Major
Donthorne
's
name
and
address
,
on
the
chance
that
he
might
still
be
alive
,
and
that
it
might
be
useful
at
some
future
time
to
apply
to
him
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
impression
on
my
mind
was
now
decidedly
adverse
to
the
opinion
that
Sir
Percival
was
Anne
's
father
,
and
decidedly
favourable
to
the
conclusion
that
the
secret
of
his
stolen
interviews
with
Mrs.
Catherick
was
entirely
unconnected
with
the
disgrace
which
the
woman
had
inflicted
on
her
husband
's
good
name
.
<EOS>
I
could
think
of
no
further
inquiries
which
I
might
make
to
strengthen
this
impression
 
I
could
only
encourage
Mrs.
Clements
to
speak
next
of
Anne
's
early
days
,
and
watch
for
any
chance
-
suggestion
which
might
in
this
way
offer
itself
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
heard
yet
,
"
I
said
,
"
how
the
poor
child
,
born
in
all
this
sin
and
misery
,
came
to
be
trusted
,
Mrs.
Clements
,
to
your
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
nobody
else
,
sir
,
to
take
the
little
helpless
creature
in
hand
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
"
The
wicked
mother
seemed
to
hate
it
 
as
if
the
poor
baby
was
in
fault
!
 
<EOS>
from
the
day
it
was
born
.
<EOS>
My
heart
was
heavy
for
the
child
,
and
I
made
the
offer
to
bring
it
up
as
tenderly
as
if
it
was
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
Anne
remain
entirely
under
your
care
from
that
time
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
quite
entirely
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Catherick
had
her
whims
and
fancies
about
it
at
times
,
and
used
now
and
then
to
lay
claim
to
the
child
,
as
if
she
wanted
to
spite
me
for
bringing
it
up
.
<EOS>
But
these
fits
of
hers
never
lasted
for
long
.
<EOS>
Poor
little
Anne
was
always
returned
to
me
,
and
was
always
glad
to
get
back
 
though
she
led
but
a
gloomy
life
in
my
house
,
having
no
playmates
,
like
other
children
,
to
brighten
her
up
.
<EOS>
Our
longest
separation
was
when
her
mother
took
her
to
Limmeridge
.
<EOS>
Just
at
that
time
I
lost
my
husband
,
and
I
felt
it
was
as
well
,
in
that
miserable
affliction
,
that
Anne
should
not
be
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
was
between
ten
and
eleven
years
old
then
,
slow
at
her
lessons
,
poor
soul
,
and
not
so
cheerful
as
other
children
 
<EOS>
but
as
pretty
a
little
girl
to
look
at
as
you
would
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
I
waited
at
home
till
her
mother
brought
her
back
,
and
then
I
made
the
offer
to
take
her
with
me
to
London
 
<EOS>
the
truth
being
,
sir
,
that
I
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
stop
at
Old
Welmingham
after
my
husband
's
death
,
the
place
was
so
changed
and
so
dismal
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
did
Mrs.
Catherick
consent
to
your
proposal
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
<EOS>
She
came
back
from
the
north
harder
and
bitterer
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Folks
did
say
that
she
had
been
obliged
to
ask
Sir
Percival
's
leave
to
go
,
to
begin
with
;
and
that
she
only
went
to
nurse
her
dying
sister
at
Limmeridge
because
the
poor
woman
was
reported
to
have
saved
money
 
<EOS>
the
truth
being
that
she
hardly
left
enough
to
bury
her
.
<EOS>
These
things
may
have
soured
Mrs.
Catherick
likely
enough
,
but
however
that
may
be
,
she
would
n't
hear
of
my
taking
the
child
away
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
like
distressing
us
both
by
parting
us
.
<EOS>
All
I
could
do
was
to
give
Anne
my
direction
,
and
to
tell
her
privately
,
if
she
was
ever
in
trouble
,
to
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
years
passed
before
she
was
free
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
her
again
,
poor
soul
,
till
the
night
she
escaped
from
the
mad
-
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
Mrs.
Clements
,
why
Sir
Percival
Glyde
shut
her
up
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
know
what
Anne
herself
told
me
,
sir
.
<EOS>
The
poor
thing
used
to
ramble
and
wander
about
it
sadly
.
<EOS>
She
said
her
mother
had
got
some
secret
of
Sir
Percival
's
to
keep
,
and
had
let
it
out
to
her
long
after
I
left
Hampshire
 
<EOS>
and
when
Sir
Percival
found
she
knew
it
,
he
shut
her
up
.
<EOS>
But
she
never
could
say
what
it
was
when
I
asked
her
.
<EOS>
All
she
could
tell
me
was
,
that
her
mother
might
be
the
ruin
and
destruction
of
Sir
Percival
if
she
chose
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Catherick
may
have
let
out
just
as
much
as
that
,
and
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
'm
next
to
certain
<EOS>
I
should
have
heard
the
whole
truth
from
Anne
,
if
she
had
really
known
it
as
she
pretended
to
do
,
and
as
she
very
likely
fancied
she
did
,
poor
soul
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
idea
had
more
than
once
occurred
to
my
own
mind
.
<EOS>
I
had
already
told
Marian
that
I
doubted
whether
Laura
was
really
on
the
point
of
making
any
important
discovery
when
she
and
Anne
Catherick
were
disturbed
by
Count
Fosco
at
the
boat
-
house
.
<EOS>
It
was
perfectly
in
character
with
Anne
's
mental
affliction
that
she
should
assume
an
absolute
knowledge
of
the
secret
on
no
better
grounds
than
vague
suspicion
,
derived
from
hints
which
her
mother
had
incautiously
let
drop
in
her
presence
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
's
guilty
distrust
would
,
in
that
case
,
infallibly
inspire
him
with
the
false
idea
that
Anne
knew
all
from
her
mother
,
just
as
it
had
afterwards
fixed
in
his
mind
the
equally
false
suspicion
that
his
wife
knew
all
from
Anne
.
  
<EOS>
The
time
was
passing
,
the
morning
was
wearing
away
.
<EOS>
It
was
doubtful
,
if
I
stayed
longer
,
whether
I
should
hear
anything
more
from
Mrs.
Clements
that
would
be
at
all
useful
to
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
had
already
discovered
those
local
and
family
particulars
,
in
relation
to
Mrs.
Catherick
,
of
which
I
had
been
in
search
,
and
I
had
arrived
at
certain
conclusions
,
entirely
new
to
me
,
which
might
immensely
assist
in
directing
the
course
of
my
future
proceedings
.
<EOS>
I
rose
to
take
my
leave
,
and
to
thank
Mrs.
Clements
for
the
friendly
readiness
she
had
shown
in
affording
me
information
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
you
must
have
thought
me
very
inquisitive
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
troubled
you
with
more
questions
than
many
people
would
have
cared
to
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
heartily
welcome
,
sir
,
to
anything
I
can
tell
you
,
"
answered
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
She
stopped
and
looked
at
me
wistfully
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
wish
,
"
said
the
poor
woman
,
"
you
could
have
told
me
a
little
more
about
Anne
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
saw
something
in
your
face
when
you
came
in
which
looked
as
if
you
could
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
think
how
hard
it
is
not
even
to
know
whether
she
is
living
or
dead
.
<EOS>
I
could
bear
it
better
if
I
was
only
certain
.
<EOS>
You
said
you
never
expected
we
should
see
her
alive
again
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
sir
 
<EOS>
do
you
know
for
truth
 
that
it
has
pleased
God
to
take
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
not
proof
against
this
appeal
,
it
would
have
been
unspeakably
mean
and
cruel
of
me
if
I
had
resisted
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
there
is
no
doubt
of
the
truth
,
"
I
answered
gently
;
"
I
have
the
certainty
in
my
own
mind
that
her
troubles
in
this
world
are
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
poor
woman
dropped
into
her
chair
and
hid
her
face
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
sir
,
"
she
said
,
"
how
do
you
know
it
?
<EOS>
Who
can
have
told
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
one
has
told
me
,
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
reasons
for
feeling
sure
of
it
 
reasons
which
I
promise
you
shall
know
as
soon
as
I
can
safely
explain
them
.
<EOS>
I
am
certain
she
was
not
neglected
in
her
last
moments
 
<EOS>
I
am
certain
the
heart
complaint
from
which
she
suffered
so
sadly
was
the
true
cause
of
her
death
.
<EOS>
You
shall
feel
as
sure
of
this
as
I
do
,
soon
 
you
shall
know
,
before
long
,
that
she
is
buried
in
a
quiet
country
churchyard
 
in
a
pretty
,
peaceful
place
,
which
you
might
have
chosen
for
her
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dead
!
"
said
Mrs.
Clements
,
"
dead
so
young
,
and
I
am
left
to
hear
it
!
<EOS>
I
made
her
first
short
frocks
.
<EOS>
I
taught
her
to
walk
.
<EOS>
The
first
time
she
ever
said
Mother
<EOS>
she
said
it
to
me
 
<EOS>
and
now
I
am
left
and
Anne
is
taken
!
<EOS>
Did
you
say
,
sir
,
"
said
the
poor
woman
,
removing
the
handkerchief
from
her
face
,
and
looking
up
at
me
for
the
first
time
,
"
did
you
say
that
she
had
been
nicely
buried
?
<EOS>
Was
it
the
sort
of
funeral
she
might
have
had
if
she
had
really
been
my
own
child
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
assured
her
that
it
was
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
take
an
inexplicable
pride
in
my
answer
 
to
find
a
comfort
in
it
which
no
other
and
higher
considerations
could
afford
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
broken
my
heart
,
"
she
said
simply
,
"
if
Anne
had
not
been
nicely
buried
 
but
<EOS>
how
do
you
know
it
,
sir
?
<EOS>
who
told
you
?
<EOS>
"
I
once
more
entreated
her
to
wait
until
I
could
speak
to
her
unreservedly
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
sure
to
see
me
again
,
"
I
said
,
"
for
I
have
a
favour
to
ask
when
you
are
a
little
more
composed
 
perhaps
in
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
keep
it
waiting
,
sir
,
on
my
account
,
"
said
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
my
crying
if
I
can
be
of
use
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
anything
on
your
mind
to
say
to
me
,
sir
,
please
to
say
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
wish
to
ask
you
one
last
question
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
want
to
know
Mrs.
Catherick
's
address
at
Welmingham
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
request
so
startled
Mrs.
Clements
,
that
,
for
the
moment
,
even
the
tidings
of
Anne
's
death
seemed
to
be
driven
from
her
mind
.
<EOS>
Her
tears
suddenly
ceased
to
flow
,
and
she
sat
looking
at
me
in
blank
amazement
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
the
Lord
's
sake
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
what
do
you
want
with
Mrs.
Catherick
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
this
,
Mrs.
Clements
,
"
I
replied
,
"
I
want
to
know
the
secret
of
those
private
meetings
of
hers
with
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
There
is
something
more
in
what
you
have
told
me
of
that
woman
's
past
conduct
,
and
of
that
man
's
past
relations
with
her
,
than
you
or
any
of
your
neighbours
ever
suspected
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
secret
we
none
of
us
know
between
those
two
,
and
I
am
going
to
Mrs.
Catherick
with
the
resolution
to
find
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Think
twice
about
it
,
sir
!
"
said
Mrs.
Clements
,
rising
in
her
earnestness
and
laying
her
hand
on
my
arm
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
an
awful
woman
 
you
do
n't
know
her
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
Think
twice
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
your
warning
is
kindly
meant
,
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
determined
to
see
the
woman
,
whatever
comes
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
looked
me
anxiously
in
the
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
your
mind
is
made
up
,
sir
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
give
you
the
address
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
wrote
it
down
in
my
pocket
-
book
and
then
took
her
hand
to
say
farewell
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
hear
from
me
soon
,
"
I
said
;
"
you
shall
know
all
that
I
have
promised
to
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
sighed
and
shook
her
head
doubtfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
An
old
woman
's
advice
is
sometimes
worth
taking
,
sir
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Think
twice
before
you
go
to
Welmingham
.
"
    
<EOS>
When
I
reached
home
again
after
my
interview
with
Mrs.
Clements
,
I
was
struck
by
the
appearance
of
a
change
in
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
The
unvarying
gentleness
and
patience
which
long
misfortune
had
tried
so
cruelly
and
had
never
conquered
yet
,
seemed
now
to
have
suddenly
failed
her
.
<EOS>
Insensible
to
all
Marian
's
attempts
to
soothe
and
amuse
her
,
she
sat
,
with
her
neglected
drawing
pushed
away
on
the
table
,
her
eyes
resolutely
cast
down
,
her
fingers
twining
and
untwining
themselves
restlessly
in
her
lap
.
<EOS>
Marian
rose
when
I
came
in
,
with
a
silent
distress
in
her
face
,
waited
for
a
moment
to
see
if
Laura
would
look
up
at
my
approach
,
whispered
to
me
,
"
Try
if
you
can
rouse
her
,
"
and
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
sat
down
in
the
vacant
chair
 
gently
unclasped
the
poor
,
worn
,
restless
fingers
,
and
took
both
her
hands
in
mine
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
thinking
of
,
Laura
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
my
darling
 
try
and
tell
me
what
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
struggled
with
herself
,
and
raised
her
eyes
to
mine
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
feel
happy
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
ca
n't
help
thinking
 
"
She
stopped
,
bent
forward
a
little
,
and
laid
her
head
on
my
shoulder
,
with
a
terrible
mute
helplessness
that
struck
me
to
the
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
Try
to
tell
me
,
"
I
repeated
gently
;
"
try
to
tell
me
why
you
are
not
happy
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
useless
 
<EOS>
I
am
such
a
burden
on
both
of
you
,
"
she
answered
,
with
a
weary
,
hopeless
sigh
.
<EOS>
"
You
work
and
get
money
,
Walter
,
and
Marian
helps
you
.
<EOS>
Why
is
there
nothing
I
can
do
?
<EOS>
You
will
end
in
liking
Marian
better
than
you
like
me
 
<EOS>
you
will
,
because
I
am
so
helpless
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
do
n't
,
do
n't
,
do
n't
treat
me
like
a
child
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
raised
her
head
,
and
smoothed
away
the
tangled
hair
that
fell
over
her
face
,
and
kissed
her
 
my
poor
,
faded
flower
!
<EOS>
my
lost
,
afflicted
sister
!
<EOS>
"
You
shall
help
us
,
Laura
,
"
I
said
,
"
you
shall
begin
,
my
darling
,
to
-
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
at
me
with
a
feverish
eagerness
,
with
a
breathless
interest
,
that
made
me
tremble
for
the
new
life
of
hope
which
I
had
called
into
being
by
those
few
words
.
  
<EOS>
I
rose
,
and
set
her
drawing
materials
in
order
,
and
placed
them
near
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
I
work
and
get
money
by
drawing
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Now
you
have
taken
such
pains
,
now
you
are
so
much
improved
,
you
shall
begin
to
work
and
get
money
too
.
<EOS>
Try
to
finish
this
little
sketch
as
nicely
and
prettily
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
When
it
is
done
I
will
take
it
away
with
me
,
and
the
same
person
will
buy
it
who
buys
all
that
I
do
.
<EOS>
You
shall
keep
your
own
earnings
in
your
own
purse
,
and
Marian
shall
come
to
you
to
help
us
,
as
often
as
she
comes
to
me
.
<EOS>
Think
how
useful
you
are
going
to
make
yourself
to
both
of
us
,
and
you
will
soon
be
as
happy
,
Laura
,
as
the
day
is
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
face
grew
eager
,
and
brightened
into
a
smile
.
<EOS>
In
the
moment
while
it
lasted
,
in
the
moment
when
she
again
took
up
the
pencils
that
had
been
laid
aside
,
she
almost
looked
like
the
Laura
of
past
days
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
rightly
interpreted
the
first
signs
of
a
new
growth
and
strength
in
her
mind
,
unconsciously
expressing
themselves
in
the
notice
she
had
taken
of
the
occupations
which
filled
her
sister
's
life
and
mine
.
<EOS>
Marian
<EOS>
(
when
I
told
her
what
had
passed
)
saw
,
as
I
saw
,
that
she
was
longing
to
assume
her
own
little
position
of
importance
,
to
raise
herself
in
her
own
estimation
and
in
ours
 
and
,
from
that
day
,
we
tenderly
helped
the
new
ambition
which
gave
promise
of
the
hopeful
,
happier
future
,
that
might
now
not
be
far
off
.
<EOS>
Her
drawings
,
as
she
finished
them
,
or
tried
to
finish
them
,
were
placed
in
my
hands
.
<EOS>
Marian
took
them
from
me
and
hid
them
carefully
,
and
I
set
aside
a
little
weekly
tribute
from
my
earnings
,
to
be
offered
to
her
as
the
price
paid
by
strangers
for
the
poor
,
faint
,
valueless
sketches
,
of
which
I
was
the
only
purchaser
.
<EOS>
It
was
hard
sometimes
to
maintain
our
innocent
deception
,
when
she
proudly
brought
out
her
purse
to
contribute
her
share
towards
the
expenses
,
and
wondered
with
serious
interest
,
whether
I
or
she
had
earned
the
most
that
week
.
<EOS>
I
have
all
those
hidden
drawings
in
my
possession
<EOS>
still
 
they
are
my
treasures
beyond
price
 
<EOS>
the
dear
remembrances
that
I
love
to
keep
alive
 
the
friends
in
past
adversity
that
my
heart
will
never
part
from
,
my
tenderness
never
forget
.
  
<EOS>
Am
<EOS>
I
trifling
,
here
,
with
the
necessities
of
my
task
?
<EOS>
am
I
looking
forward
to
the
happier
time
which
my
narrative
has
not
yet
reached
?
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Back
again
 
back
to
the
days
of
doubt
and
dread
,
when
the
spirit
within
me
struggled
hard
for
its
life
,
in
the
icy
stillness
of
perpetual
suspense
.
<EOS>
I
have
paused
and
rested
for
a
while
on
my
forward
course
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
,
perhaps
,
time
wasted
,
if
the
friends
who
read
these
pages
have
paused
and
rested
too
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
the
first
opportunity
I
could
find
of
speaking
to
Marian
in
private
,
and
of
communicating
to
her
the
result
of
the
inquiries
which
I
had
made
that
morning
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
share
the
opinion
on
the
subject
of
my
proposed
journey
to
Welmingham
,
which
Mrs.
Clements
had
already
expressed
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
Walter
,
"
she
said
,
"
you
hardly
know
enough
yet
to
give
you
any
hope
of
claiming
Mrs.
Catherick
's
confidence
?
<EOS>
Is
it
wise
to
proceed
to
these
extremities
,
before
you
have
really
exhausted
all
safer
and
simpler
means
of
attaining
your
object
?
<EOS>
When
you
told
me
that
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
were
the
only
two
people
in
existence
who
knew
the
exact
date
of
Laura
's
journey
,
you
forgot
,
and
I
forgot
,
that
there
was
a
third
person
who
must
surely
know
it
 
<EOS>
I
mean
Mrs.
Rubelle
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
far
easier
,
and
far
less
dangerous
,
to
insist
on
a
confession
from
her
,
than
to
force
it
from
Sir
Percival
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
might
be
easier
,
"
I
replied
,
"
but
we
are
not
aware
of
the
full
extent
of
Mrs.
Rubelle
's
connivance
and
interest
in
the
conspiracy
,
and
we
are
therefore
not
certain
that
the
date
has
been
impressed
on
her
mind
,
as
it
has
been
assuredly
impressed
on
the
minds
of
Sir
Percival
and
the
Count
.
<EOS>
It
is
too
late
,
now
,
to
waste
the
time
on
Mrs.
Rubelle
,
which
may
be
all
-
important
to
the
discovery
of
the
one
assailable
point
in
Sir
Percival
's
life
.
<EOS>
Are
you
thinking
a
little
too
seriously
,
Marian
,
of
the
risk
I
may
run
in
returning
to
Hampshire
?
<EOS>
Are
you
beginning
to
doubt
whether
Sir
Percival
Glyde
may
not
in
the
end
be
more
than
a
match
for
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
not
be
more
than
your
match
,
"
she
replied
decidedly
,
"
because
he
will
not
be
helped
in
resisting
you
by
the
impenetrable
wickedness
of
the
Count
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
has
led
you
to
that
conclusion
?
<EOS>
"
I
replied
,
in
some
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
own
knowledge
of
Sir
Percival
's
obstinacy
and
impatience
of
the
Count
's
control
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
he
will
insist
on
meeting
you
single
-
handed
 
just
as
he
insisted
at
first
on
acting
for
himself
at
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
The
time
for
suspecting
the
Count
's
interference
will
be
the
time
when
you
have
Sir
Percival
at
your
mercy
.
<EOS>
His
own
interests
will
then
be
directly
threatened
,
and
he
will
act
,
Walter
,
to
terrible
purpose
in
his
own
defence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
may
deprive
him
of
his
weapons
beforehand
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Some
of
the
particulars
I
have
heard
from
Mrs.
Clements
may
yet
be
turned
to
account
against
him
,
and
other
means
of
strengthening
the
case
may
be
at
our
disposal
.
<EOS>
There
are
passages
in
Mrs.
Michelson
's
narrative
which
show
that
the
Count
found
it
necessary
to
place
himself
in
communication
with
Mr.
Fairlie
,
and
there
may
be
circumstances
which
compromise
him
in
that
proceeding
.
<EOS>
While
I
am
away
,
Marian
,
write
to
Mr.
Fairlie
and
say
that
you
want
an
answer
describing
exactly
what
passed
between
the
Count
and
himself
,
and
informing
you
also
of
any
particulars
that
may
have
come
to
his
knowledge
at
the
same
time
in
connection
with
his
niece
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
that
the
statement
you
request
will
,
sooner
or
later
,
be
insisted
on
,
if
he
shows
any
reluctance
to
furnish
you
with
it
of
his
own
accord
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
letter
shall
be
written
,
Walter
.
<EOS>
But
are
you
really
determined
to
go
to
Welmingham
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Absolutely
determined
.
<EOS>
I
will
devote
the
next
two
days
to
earning
what
we
want
for
the
week
to
come
,
and
on
the
third
day
I
go
to
Hampshire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
the
third
day
came
I
was
ready
for
my
journey
.
  
<EOS>
As
it
was
possible
that
I
might
be
absent
for
some
little
time
,
I
arranged
with
Marian
that
we
were
to
correspond
every
day
 
of
course
addressing
each
other
by
assumed
names
,
for
caution
's
sake
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
I
heard
from
her
regularly
,
I
should
assume
that
nothing
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
But
if
the
morning
came
and
brought
me
no
letter
,
my
return
to
London
would
take
place
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
by
the
first
train
.
<EOS>
I
contrived
to
reconcile
Laura
to
my
departure
by
telling
her
that
I
was
going
to
the
country
to
find
new
purchasers
for
her
drawings
and
for
mine
,
and
I
left
her
occupied
and
happy
.
<EOS>
Marian
followed
me
downstairs
to
the
street
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Remember
what
anxious
hearts
you
leave
here
,
"
she
whispered
,
as
we
stood
together
in
the
passage
.
"
<EOS>
Remember
all
the
hopes
that
hang
on
your
safe
return
.
<EOS>
If
strange
things
happen
to
you
on
this
journey
 
if
you
and
Sir
Percival
meet
 
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
makes
you
think
we
shall
meet
?
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
 
<EOS>
I
have
fears
and
fancies
that
I
can
not
account
for
.
<EOS>
Laugh
at
them
,
Walter
,
if
you
like
 
<EOS>
but
,
for
God
's
sake
,
keep
your
temper
if
you
come
in
contact
with
that
man
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
fear
,
Marian
!
<EOS>
I
answer
for
my
self
-
control
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
those
words
we
parted
.
  
<EOS>
I
walked
briskly
to
the
station
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
glow
of
hope
in
me
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
growing
conviction
in
my
mind
that
my
journey
this
time
would
not
be
taken
in
vain
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
fine
,
clear
,
cold
morning
.
<EOS>
My
nerves
were
firmly
strung
,
and
I
felt
all
the
strength
of
my
resolution
stirring
in
me
vigorously
from
head
to
foot
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
crossed
the
railway
platform
,
and
looked
right
and
left
among
the
people
congregated
on
it
,
to
search
for
any
faces
among
them
that
I
knew
,
the
doubt
occurred
to
me
whether
it
might
not
have
been
to
my
advantage
if
I
had
adopted
a
disguise
before
setting
out
for
Hampshire
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
something
so
repellent
to
me
in
the
idea
 
something
so
meanly
like
the
common
herd
of
spies
and
informers
in
the
mere
act
of
adopting
a
disguise
 
that
I
dismissed
the
question
from
consideration
almost
as
soon
as
it
had
risen
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
Even
as
a
mere
matter
of
expediency
<EOS>
the
proceeding
was
doubtful
in
the
extreme
.
<EOS>
If
I
tried
the
experiment
at
home
the
landlord
of
the
house
would
sooner
or
later
discover
me
,
and
would
have
his
suspicions
aroused
immediately
.
<EOS>
If
I
tried
it
away
from
home
the
same
persons
might
see
me
,
by
the
commonest
accident
,
with
the
disguise
and
without
it
,
and
I
should
in
that
way
be
inviting
the
notice
and
distrust
<EOS>
which
it
was
my
most
pressing
interest
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
In
my
own
character
I
had
acted
thus
far
 
and
in
my
own
character
I
was
resolved
to
continue
to
the
end
.
  
<EOS>
The
train
left
me
at
Welmingham
early
in
the
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
Is
there
any
wilderness
of
sand
in
the
deserts
of
Arabia
,
is
there
any
prospect
of
desolation
among
the
ruins
of
Palestine
,
which
can
rival
the
repelling
effect
on
the
eye
,
and
the
depressing
influence
on
the
mind
,
of
an
English
country
town
in
the
first
stage
of
its
existence
,
and
in
the
transition
state
of
its
prosperity
?
<EOS>
I
asked
myself
that
question
as
I
passed
through
the
clean
desolation
,
the
neat
ugliness
,
the
prim
torpor
of
the
streets
of
Welmingham
.
<EOS>
And
the
tradesmen
who
stared
after
me
from
their
lonely
shops
 
the
trees
that
drooped
helpless
in
their
arid
exile
of
unfinished
crescents
and
squares
 
the
dead
house
-
carcasses
that
waited
in
vain
for
the
vivifying
human
element
to
animate
them
with
the
breath
of
life
 
<EOS>
every
creature
that
I
saw
,
every
object
that
I
passed
,
seemed
to
answer
with
one
accord
:
The
deserts
of
Arabia
are
innocent
of
our
civilised
desolation
 
the
ruins
of
Palestine
are
incapable
of
our
modern
gloom
!
  
<EOS>
I
inquired
my
way
to
the
quarter
of
the
town
in
which
Mrs.
Catherick
lived
,
and
on
reaching
it
found
myself
in
a
square
of
small
houses
,
one
story
high
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
bare
little
plot
of
grass
in
the
middle
,
protected
by
a
cheap
wire
fence
.
<EOS>
An
elderly
nursemaid
and
two
children
were
standing
in
a
corner
of
the
enclosure
,
looking
at
a
lean
goat
tethered
to
the
grass
.
<EOS>
Two
foot
-
passengers
were
talking
together
on
one
side
of
the
pavement
before
the
houses
,
and
an
idle
little
boy
was
leading
an
idle
little
dog
along
by
a
string
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
heard
the
dull
tinkling
of
a
piano
at
a
distance
,
accompanied
by
the
intermittent
knocking
of
a
hammer
nearer
at
hand
.
<EOS>
These
were
all
the
sights
and
sounds
of
life
that
encountered
me
when
I
entered
the
square
.
  
<EOS>
I
walked
at
once
to
the
door
of
Number
Thirteen
 
<EOS>
the
number
of
Mrs.
Catherick
's
house
 
and
knocked
,
without
waiting
to
consider
beforehand
how
I
might
best
present
myself
when
I
got
in
.
<EOS>
The
first
necessity
was
to
see
Mrs.
Catherick
.
<EOS>
I
could
then
judge
,
from
my
own
observation
,
of
the
safest
and
easiest
manner
of
approaching
the
object
of
my
visit
.
  
<EOS>
The
door
was
opened
by
a
melancholy
middle
-
aged
woman
servant
.
<EOS>
I
gave
her
my
card
,
and
asked
if
I
could
see
Mrs.
Catherick
.
<EOS>
The
card
was
taken
into
the
front
parlour
,
and
the
servant
returned
with
a
message
requesting
me
to
mention
what
my
business
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
Say
,
if
you
please
,
that
my
business
relates
to
Mrs.
Catherick
's
daughter
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
best
pretext
I
could
think
of
,
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
,
to
account
for
my
visit
.
  
<EOS>
The
servant
again
retired
to
the
parlour
,
again
returned
,
and
this
time
begged
me
,
with
a
look
of
gloomy
amazement
,
to
walk
in
.
  
<EOS>
I
entered
a
little
room
,
with
a
flaring
paper
of
the
largest
pattern
on
the
walls
.
<EOS>
Chairs
,
tables
,
cheffonier
,
and
sofa
,
all
gleamed
with
the
glutinous
brightness
of
cheap
upholstery
.
<EOS>
On
the
largest
table
,
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
stood
a
smart
Bible
,
placed
exactly
in
the
centre
on
a
red
and
yellow
woollen
mat
and
at
the
side
of
the
table
nearest
to
the
window
,
with
a
little
knitting
-
basket
on
her
lap
,
and
a
wheezing
,
blear
-
eyed
old
spaniel
crouched
at
her
feet
,
there
sat
an
elderly
woman
,
wearing
a
black
net
cap
and
a
black
silk
gown
,
and
having
slate
-
coloured
mittens
on
her
hands
.
<EOS>
Her
iron
-
grey
hair
hung
in
heavy
bands
on
either
side
of
her
face
 
<EOS>
her
dark
eyes
looked
straight
forward
,
with
a
hard
,
defiant
,
implacable
stare
.
<EOS>
She
had
full
square
cheeks
,
a
long
,
firm
chin
,
and
thick
,
sensual
,
colourless
lips
.
<EOS>
Her
figure
was
stout
and
sturdy
,
and
her
manner
aggressively
self
-
possessed
.
<EOS>
This
was
Mrs.
Catherick
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
come
to
speak
to
me
about
my
daughter
,
"
she
said
,
before
I
could
utter
a
word
on
my
side
.
"
<EOS>
Be
so
good
as
to
mention
what
you
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
tone
of
her
voice
was
as
hard
,
as
defiant
,
as
implacable
as
the
expression
of
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
pointed
to
a
chair
,
and
looked
me
all
over
attentively
,
from
head
to
foot
,
as
I
sat
down
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
saw
that
my
only
chance
with
this
woman
was
to
speak
to
her
in
her
own
tone
,
and
to
meet
her
,
at
the
outset
of
our
interview
,
on
her
own
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
aware
,
"
I
said
,
"
that
your
daughter
has
been
lost
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
perfectly
aware
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
felt
any
apprehension
that
the
misfortune
of
her
loss
might
be
followed
by
the
misfortune
of
her
death
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Have
you
come
here
to
tell
me
she
is
dead
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
put
that
extraordinary
question
without
the
slightest
change
in
her
voice
,
her
face
,
or
her
manner
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
appeared
more
perfectly
unconcerned
if
I
had
told
her
of
the
death
of
the
goat
in
the
enclosure
outside
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
ask
why
I
come
here
to
tell
you
of
your
daughter
's
death
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
What
interest
have
you
in
me
,
or
in
her
?
<EOS>
How
do
you
come
to
know
anything
about
my
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
this
way
.
<EOS>
I
met
her
on
the
night
when
she
escaped
from
the
Asylum
,
and
I
assisted
her
in
reaching
a
place
of
safety
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
very
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
hear
her
mother
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Her
mother
does
say
so
.
<EOS>
How
do
you
know
she
is
dead
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
at
liberty
to
say
how
I
know
it
 
<EOS>
but
I
DO
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
at
liberty
to
say
how
you
found
out
my
address
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Certainly
.
<EOS>
I
got
your
address
from
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mrs.
Clements
is
a
foolish
woman
.
<EOS>
Did
she
tell
you
to
come
here
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
did
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
I
ask
you
again
,
why
did
you
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
she
was
determined
to
have
her
answer
,
I
gave
it
to
her
in
the
plainest
possible
form
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
came
,
"
I
said
,
"
because
I
thought
Anne
Catherick
's
mother
might
have
some
natural
interest
in
knowing
whether
she
was
alive
or
dead
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
so
,
"
said
Mrs.
Catherick
,
with
additional
self
-
possession
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Had
you
no
other
motive
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hesitated
.
<EOS>
The
right
answer
to
that
question
was
not
easy
to
find
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
no
other
motive
,
"
she
went
on
,
deliberately
taking
off
her
slate
-
coloured
mittens
,
and
rolling
them
up
,
"
I
have
only
to
thank
you
for
your
visit
,
and
to
say
that
I
will
not
detain
you
here
any
longer
.
<EOS>
Your
information
would
be
more
satisfactory
if
you
were
willing
to
explain
how
you
became
possessed
of
it
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
justifies
me
,
I
suppose
,
in
going
into
mourning
.
<EOS>
There
is
not
much
alteration
necessary
in
my
dress
,
as
you
see
.
<EOS>
When
I
have
changed
my
mittens
,
I
shall
be
all
in
black
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
searched
in
the
pocket
of
her
gown
,
drew
out
a
pair
of
black
lace
mittens
,
put
them
on
with
the
stoniest
and
steadiest
composure
,
and
then
quietly
crossed
her
hands
in
her
lap
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
good
morning
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
The
cool
contempt
of
her
manner
irritated
me
into
directly
avowing
that
the
purpose
of
my
visit
had
not
been
answered
yet
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
HAVE
another
motive
in
coming
here
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
thought
so
,
"
remarked
Mrs.
Catherick
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
daughter
's
death
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
What
did
she
die
of
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Of
disease
of
the
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
daughter
's
death
has
been
made
the
pretext
for
inflicting
serious
injury
on
a
person
who
is
very
dear
to
me
.
<EOS>
Two
men
have
been
concerned
,
to
my
certain
knowledge
,
in
doing
that
wrong
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
is
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
looked
attentively
to
see
if
she
flinched
at
the
sudden
mention
of
that
name
.
<EOS>
Not
a
muscle
of
her
stirred
 
<EOS>
the
hard
,
defiant
,
implacable
stare
in
her
eyes
never
wavered
for
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
wonder
,
"
I
went
on
,
"
how
the
event
of
your
daughter
's
death
can
have
been
made
the
means
of
inflicting
injury
on
another
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mrs.
Catherick
;
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
wonder
at
all
.
<EOS>
This
appears
to
be
your
affair
.
<EOS>
You
are
interested
in
my
affairs
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
interested
in
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
ask
,
then
,
"
I
persisted
,
"
why
I
mention
the
matter
in
your
presence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
DO
ask
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mention
it
because
I
am
determined
to
bring
Sir
Percival
Glyde
to
account
for
the
wickedness
he
has
committed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
I
to
do
with
your
determination
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
hear
.
<EOS>
There
are
certain
events
in
Sir
Percival
's
past
life
which
it
is
necessary
for
my
purpose
to
be
fully
acquainted
with
.
<EOS>
YOU
know
them
 
and
for
that
reason
I
come
to
YOU
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
events
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Events
that
occurred
at
Old
Welmingham
when
your
husband
was
parish
-
clerk
at
that
place
,
and
before
the
time
when
your
daughter
was
born
.
<EOS>
"
  
I
had
reached
the
woman
at
last
through
the
barrier
of
impenetrable
reserve
that
she
had
tried
to
set
up
between
us
.
<EOS>
I
saw
her
temper
smouldering
in
her
eyes
 
as
plainly
as
I
saw
her
hands
grow
restless
,
then
unclasp
themselves
,
and
begin
mechanically
smoothing
her
dress
over
her
knees
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
know
of
those
events
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
that
Mrs.
Clements
could
tell
me
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
momentary
flush
on
her
firm
square
face
,
a
momentary
stillness
in
her
restless
hands
,
which
seemed
to
betoken
a
coming
outburst
of
anger
that
might
throw
her
off
her
guard
.
<EOS>
But
no
 
she
mastered
the
rising
irritation
,
leaned
back
in
her
chair
,
crossed
her
arms
on
her
broad
bosom
,
and
with
a
smile
of
grim
sarcasm
on
her
thick
lips
,
looked
at
me
as
steadily
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
begin
to
understand
it
all
now
,
"
she
said
,
her
tamed
and
disciplined
anger
only
expressing
itself
in
the
elaborate
mockery
of
her
tone
and
manner
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
got
a
grudge
of
your
own
against
Sir
Percival
Glyde
,
and
I
must
help
you
to
wreak
it
.
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
this
,
that
,
and
the
other
about
Sir
Percival
and
myself
,
must
I
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
indeed
?
<EOS>
You
have
been
prying
into
my
private
affairs
.
<EOS>
You
think
you
have
found
a
lost
woman
to
deal
with
,
who
lives
here
on
sufferance
,
and
who
will
do
anything
you
ask
for
fear
you
may
injure
her
in
the
opinions
of
the
town's
-
people
.
<EOS>
I
see
through
you
and
your
precious
speculation
 
I
do
!
<EOS>
and
it
amuses
me
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
ha
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
stopped
for
a
moment
,
her
arms
tightened
over
her
bosom
,
and
she
laughed
to
herself
 
a
hard
,
harsh
,
angry
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
how
I
have
lived
in
this
place

and
what
I

done

this
place

Mr.
What's
-
your

name

she
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
,
before
I
ring
the
bell
and
have
you
shown
out

<EOS>
I
came
here
a
wronged
woman
 
<EOS>
I
came
here
robbed
of
my
character

determined
to
claim
it
back
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
years
and
years
about
it
 
<EOS>
and
I
HAVE
claimed
it
back
.
<EOS>
I
have
matched
the
respectable
people
fairly
and
openly
on
their
own
ground
.
<EOS>
If
they
say
anything
against
me
now
they
must
say
it
in
secret
 
<EOS>
they
ca
n't
say
it

they
dare
n't
say
it

stand
high
enough
in
this
town

be
out

<EOS>
THE
CLERGYMAN
BOWS
TO
ME
.
<EOS>
Aha
!
<EOS>
you
did
n't
bargain
for
that
when
you
came
here
.
<EOS>
Go
to
the
church
and
inquire
about
me
 
<EOS>
you
will
find
Mrs.
Catherick
has
her
sitting
like
the
rest
of
them
,
and
pays
the
rent
on
the
day
it
's
due
.
<EOS>
Go
to
the
town
-
hall
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
petition
lying
there
 
a
petition
of
the
respectable
inhabitants
against
allowing
a
circus
to
come
and
perform
here
and
corrupt
our
morals
 
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
OUR
morals
.
<EOS>
I
signed
that
petition
this
morning
.
<EOS>
Go
to
the
bookseller
's
shop
.
<EOS>
The
clergyman
's
Wednesday
evening
Lectures
on
Justification
by
Faith
are
publishing
there
by
subscription
 
<EOS>
I
'm
down
on
the
list
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
's
wife
only
put
a
shilling
in
the
plate
at
our
last
charity
sermon
 
<EOS>
I
put
half
-
a
-
crown
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Churchwarden
Soward
held
the
plate
,
and
bowed
to
me
.
<EOS>
Ten
years
ago
he
told
Pigrum
the
chemist
I
ought
to
be
whipped
out
of
the
town
at
the
cart
's
tail
.
<EOS>
Is
your
mother
alive
?
<EOS>
Has
she
got
a
better
Bible
on
her
table
than
I
have
got
on
mine
?
<EOS>
Does
she
stand
better
with
her
trades
-
people
than
I
do
with
mine
?
<EOS>
Has
she
always
lived
within
her
income
?
<EOS>
I
have
always
lived
within
mine
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
there
IS
the
clergyman
coming
along
the
square
.
<EOS>
Look
,
Mr.
What's
-
your
-
name
 
<EOS>
look
,
if
you
please
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
started
up
with
the
activity
of
a
young
woman
,
went
to
the
window
,
waited
till
the
clergyman
passed
,
and
bowed
to
him
solemnly
.
<EOS>
The
clergyman
ceremoniously
raised
his
hat
,
and
walked
on
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Catherick
returned
to
her
chair
,
and
looked
at
me
with
a
grimmer
sarcasm
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
that
for
a
woman
with
a
lost
character
?
<EOS>
How
does
your
speculation
look
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
singular
manner
in
which
she
had
chosen
to
assert
herself
,
the
extraordinary
practical
vindication
of
her
position
in
the
town
which
she
had
just
offered
,
had
so
perplexed
me
that
I
listened
to
her
in
silent
surprise
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
the
less
resolved
,
however
,
to
make
another
effort
to
throw
her
off
her
guard
.
<EOS>
If
the
woman
's
fierce
temper
once
got
beyond
her
control
,
and
once
flamed
out
on
me
,
she
might
yet
say
the
words
which
would
put
the
clue
in
my
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
does
your
speculation
look
now
?
<EOS>
"
she
repeated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Exactly
as
it
looked
when
I
first
came
in
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
doubt
the
position
you
have
gained
in
the
town
,
and
I
do
n't
wish
to
assail
it
even
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
I
came
here
because
Sir
Percival
Glyde
is
,
to
my
certain
knowledge
,
your
enemy
,
as
well
as
mine
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
a
grudge
against
him
,
you
have
a
grudge
against
him
too
.
<EOS>
You
may
deny
it
if
you
like
,
you
may
distrust
me
as
much
as
you
please
,
you
may
be
as
angry
as
you
will
 
<EOS>
but
,
of
all
the
women
in
England
,
you
,
if
you
have
any
sense
of
injury
,
are
the
woman
who
ought
to
help
me
to
crush
that
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Crush
him
for
yourself
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
;
"
then
come
back
here
,
and
see
what
I
say
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
spoke
those
words
as
she
had
not
spoken
yet
,
quickly
,
fiercely
,
vindictively
.
<EOS>
I
had
stirred
in
its
lair
the
serpent
-
hatred
of
years
,
but
only
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Like
a
lurking
reptile
it
leaped
up
at
me
as
she
eagerly
bent
forward
towards
the
place
in
which
I
was
sitting
.
<EOS>
Like
a
lurking
reptile
it
dropped
out
of
sight
again
as
she
instantly
resumed
her
former
position
in
the
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
trust
me
?
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
afraid
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
I
look
as
if
I
was
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
afraid
of
Sir
Percival
Glyde
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
colour
was
rising
,
and
her
hands
were
at
work
again
smoothing
her
gown
.
<EOS>
I
pressed
the
point
farther
and
farther
home
,
I
went
on
without
allowing
her
a
moment
of
delay
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Percival
has
a
high
position
in
the
world
,
"
I
said
;
"
it
would
be
no
wonder
if
you
were
afraid
of
him
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
is
a
powerful
man
,
a
baronet
,
the
possessor
of
a
fine
estate
,
the
descendant
of
a
great
family
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
amazed
me
beyond
expression
by
suddenly
bursting
out
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
repeated
,
in
tones
of
the
bitterest
,
steadiest
contempt
.
"
<EOS>
A
baronet
,
the
possessor
of
a
fine
estate
,
the
descendant
of
a
great
family
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
A
great
family
 
especially
by
the
mother
's
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
time
to
reflect
on
the
words
that
had
just
escaped
her
,
there
was
only
time
to
feel
that
they
were
well
worth
thinking
over
the
moment
I
left
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
here
to
dispute
with
you
about
family
questions
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
of
Sir
Percival
's
mother
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
you
know
as
little
of
Sir
Percival
himself
,
"
she
interposed
sharply
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
advise
you
not
to
be
too
sure
of
that
,
"
I
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
some
things
about
him
,
and
I
suspect
many
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
suspect
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
DON'T
suspect
.
<EOS>
I
DON'T
suspect
him
of
being
Anne
's
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
started
to
her
feet
,
and
came
close
up
to
me
with
a
look
of
fury
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
talk
to
me
about
Anne
's
father
!
<EOS>
How
dare
you
say
who
was
her
father
,
or
who
was
n't
!
"
<EOS>
she
broke
out
,
her
face
quivering
,
her
voice
trembling
with
passion
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
secret
between
you
and
Sir
Percival
is
not
THAT
secret
,
"
I
persisted
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
mystery
which
darkens
Sir
Percival
's
life
was
not
born
with
your
daughter
's
birth
,
and
has
not
died
with
your
daughter
's
death
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
drew
back
a
step
.
"
<EOS>
Go
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
and
pointed
sternly
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
no
thought
of
the
child
in
your
heart
or
in
his
,
"
<EOS>
I
went
on
,
determined
to
press
her
back
to
her
last
defences
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
no
bond
of
guilty
love
between
you
and
him
when
you
held
those
stolen
meetings
,
when
your
husband
found
you
whispering
together
under
the
vestry
of
the
church
.
"
  
Her
pointing
hand
instantly
dropped
to
her
side
,
and
the
deep
flush
of
anger
faded
from
her
face
while
I
spoke
.
<EOS>
I
saw
the
change
pass
over
her
 
<EOS>
I
saw
that
hard
,
firm
,
fearless
,
self
-
possessed
woman
quail
under
a
terror
which
her
utmost
resolution
was
not
strong
enough
to
resist
when
I
said
those
five
last
words
,
"
the
vestry
of
the
church
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
For
a
minute
or
more
we
stood
looking
at
each
other
in
silence
.
<EOS>
I
spoke
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
still
refuse
to
trust
me
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
call
the
colour
that
had
left
it
back
to
her
face
,
but
she
had
steadied
her
voice
,
she
had
recovered
the
defiant
self
-
possession
of
her
manner
when
she
answered
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
refuse
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
still
tell
me
to
go
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Go
 
and
never
come
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
walked
to
the
door
,
waited
a
moment
before
I
opened
it
,
and
turned
round
to
look
at
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
have
news
to
bring
you
of
Sir
Percival
which
you
do
n't
expect
,
"
I
said
,
"
and
in
that
case
I
shall
come
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
news
of
Sir
Percival
that
I
do
n't
expect
,
except
 
<EOS>
"
  
She
stopped
,
her
pale
face
darkened
,
and
she
stole
back
with
a
quiet
,
stealthy
,
cat
-
like
step
to
her
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Except
the
news
of
his
death
,
"
she
said
,
sitting
down
again
,
with
the
mockery
of
a
smile
just
hovering
on
her
cruel
lips
,
and
the
furtive
light
of
hatred
lurking
deep
in
her
steady
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
opened
the
door
of
the
room
to
go
out
,
she
looked
round
at
me
quickly
.
<EOS>
The
cruel
smile
slowly
widened
her
lips
 
<EOS>
she
eyed
me
,
with
a
strange
stealthy
interest
,
from
head
to
foot
 
an
unutterable
expectation
showed
itself
wickedly
all
over
her
face
.
<EOS>
Was
she
speculating
,
in
the
secrecy
of
her
own
heart
,
on
my
youth
and
strength
,
on
the
force
of
my
sense
of
injury
and
the
limits
of
my
self
-
control
,
and
was
she
considering
the
lengths
to
which
they
might
carry
me
,
if
Sir
Percival
and
I
ever
chanced
to
meet
?
<EOS>
The
bare
doubt
that
it
might
be
so
drove
me
from
her
presence
,
and
silenced
even
the
common
forms
of
farewell
on
my
lips
.
<EOS>
Without
a
word
more
,
on
my
side
or
on
hers
,
I
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
opened
the
outer
door
,
I
saw
the
same
clergyman
who
had
already
passed
the
house
once
,
about
to
pass
it
again
,
on
his
way
back
through
the
square
.
<EOS>
I
waited
on
the
door
-
step
to
let
him
go
by
,
and
looked
round
,
as
I
did
so
,
at
the
parlour
window
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Catherick
had
heard
his
footsteps
approaching
,
in
the
silence
of
that
lonely
place
,
and
she
was
on
her
feet
at
the
window
again
,
waiting
for
him
.
<EOS>
Not
all
the
strength
of
all
the
terrible
passions
I
had
roused
in
that
woman
's
heart
,
could
loosen
her
desperate
hold
on
the
one
fragment
of
social
consideration
which
years
of
resolute
effort
had
just
dragged
within
her
grasp
.
<EOS>
There
she
was
again
,
not
a
minute
after
I
had
left
her
,
placed
purposely
in
a
position
which
made
it
a
matter
of
common
courtesy
on
the
part
of
the
clergyman
to
bow
to
her
for
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
He
raised
his
hat
once
more
.
<EOS>
I
saw
the
hard
ghastly
face
behind
the
window
soften
,
and
light
up
with
gratified
pride
 
<EOS>
I
saw
the
head
with
the
grim
black
cap
bend
ceremoniously
in
return
.
<EOS>
The
clergyman
had
bowed
to
her
,
and
in
my
presence
,
twice
in
one
day
!
    
<EOS>
I
Left
the
house
,
feeling
that
Mrs.
Catherick
had
helped
me
a
step
forward
,
in
spite
of
herself
.
<EOS>
Before
I
had
reached
the
turning
which
led
out
of
the
square
,
my
attention
was
suddenly
aroused
by
the
sound
of
a
closing
door
behind
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
looked
round
,
and
saw
an
undersized
man
in
black
on
the
door
-
step
of
a
house
,
<EOS>
which
,
as
well
as
I
could
judge
,
stood
next
to
Mrs.
Catherick
's
place
of
abode
 
next
to
it
,
on
the
side
nearest
to
me
.
<EOS>
The
man
did
not
hesitate
a
moment
about
the
direction
he
should
take
.
<EOS>
He
advanced
rapidly
towards
the
turning
at
which
I
had
stopped
.
<EOS>
I
recognised
him
as
the
lawyer
's
clerk
,
who
had
preceded
me
in
my
visit
to
Blackwater
Park
,
and
who
had
tried
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
me
,
when
I
asked
him
if
I
could
see
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
waited
where
I
was
,
to
ascertain
whether
his
object
was
to
come
to
close
quarters
and
speak
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
To
my
surprise
he
passed
on
rapidly
,
without
saying
a
word
,
without
even
looking
up
in
my
face
as
he
went
by
.
<EOS>
This
was
such
a
complete
inversion
of
the
course
of
proceeding
which
I
had
every
reason
to
expect
on
his
part
,
that
my
curiosity
,
or
rather
my
suspicion
,
was
aroused
,
and
I
determined
on
my
side
to
keep
him
cautiously
in
view
,
and
to
discover
what
the
business
might
be
in
which
he
was
now
employed
.
<EOS>
Without
caring
whether
he
saw
me
or
not
,
I
walked
after
him
.
<EOS>
He
never
looked
back
,
and
he
led
me
straight
through
the
streets
to
the
railway
station
.
  
<EOS>
The
train
was
on
the
point
of
starting
,
and
two
or
three
passengers
who
were
late
were
clustering
round
the
small
opening
through
which
the
tickets
were
issued
.
<EOS>
I
joined
them
,
and
distinctly
heard
the
lawyer
's
clerk
demand
a
ticket
for
the
Blackwater
station
.
<EOS>
I
satisfied
myself
that
he
had
actually
left
by
the
train
before
I
came
away
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
only
one
interpretation
that
I
could
place
on
what
I
had
just
seen
and
heard
.
<EOS>
I
had
unquestionably
observed
the
man
leaving
a
house
which
closely
adjoined
Mrs.
Catherick
's
residence
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
probably
placed
there
,
by
Sir
Percival
's
directions
,
as
a
lodger
,
in
anticipation
of
my
inquiries
leading
me
,
sooner
or
later
,
to
communicate
with
Mrs.
Catherick
.
<EOS>
He
had
doubtless
seen
me
go
in
and
come
out
,
and
he
had
hurried
away
by
the
first
train
to
make
his
report
at
Blackwater
Park
,
to
which
place
Sir
Percival
would
naturally
betake
himself
(
knowing
what
he
evidently
knew
of
my
movements
)
,
in
order
to
be
ready
on
the
spot
,
if
I
returned
to
Hampshire
.
<EOS>
Before
many
days
were
over
,
there
seemed
every
likelihood
now
that
he
and
I
might
meet
.
  
<EOS>
Whatever
result
events
might
be
destined
to
produce
,
I
resolved
to
pursue
my
own
course
,
straight
to
the
end
in
view
,
without
stopping
or
turning
aside
for
Sir
Percival
or
for
any
one
.
<EOS>
The
great
responsibility
which
weighed
on
me
heavily
in
London
 
<EOS>
the
responsibility
of
so
guiding
my
slightest
actions
as
to
prevent
them
from
leading
accidentally
to
the
discovery
of
Laura
's
place
of
refuge
 
was
removed
,
now
that
I
was
in
Hampshire
.
<EOS>
I
could
go
and
come
as
I
pleased
at
Welmingham
,
and
if
I
chanced
to
fail
in
observing
any
necessary
precautions
,
the
immediate
results
,
at
least
,
would
affect
no
one
but
myself
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
left
the
station
the
winter
evening
was
beginning
to
close
in
.
<EOS>
There
was
little
hope
of
continuing
my
inquiries
after
dark
to
any
useful
purpose
in
a
neighbourhood
that
was
strange
to
me
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
I
made
my
way
to
the
nearest
hotel
,
and
ordered
my
dinner
and
my
bed
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
I
wrote
to
Marian
,
to
tell
her
that
I
was
safe
and
well
,
and
that
I
had
fair
prospects
of
success
.
<EOS>
I
had
directed
her
,
on
leaving
home
,
to
address
the
first
letter
she
wrote
to
me
(
the
letter
I
expected
to
receive
the
next
morning
)
to
"
The
Post
-
Office
,
Welmingham
,
"
and
I
now
begged
her
to
send
her
second
day
's
letter
to
the
same
address
.
  
<EOS>
I
could
easily
receive
it
by
writing
to
the
postmaster
if
I
happened
to
be
away
from
the
town
when
it
arrived
.
  
<EOS>
The
coffee
-
room
of
the
hotel
,
as
it
grew
late
in
the
evening
,
became
a
perfect
solitude
.
<EOS>
I
was
left
to
reflect
on
what
I
had
accomplished
that
afternoon
as
uninterruptedly
as
if
the
house
had
been
my
own
.
<EOS>
Before
I
retired
to
rest
<EOS>
I
had
attentively
thought
over
my
extraordinary
interview
with
Mrs.
Catherick
from
beginning
to
end
,
and
had
verified
at
my
leisure
the
conclusions
which
I
had
hastily
drawn
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
The
vestry
of
Old
Welmingham
church
was
the
starting
-
point
from
which
my
mind
slowly
worked
its
way
back
through
all
that
I
had
heard
Mrs.
Catherick
say
,
and
through
all
I
had
seen
Mrs.
Catherick
do
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
time
when
the
neighbourhood
of
the
vestry
was
first
referred
to
in
my
presence
by
Mrs.
Clements
,
I
had
thought
it
the
strangest
and
most
unaccountable
of
all
places
for
Sir
Percival
to
select
for
a
clandestine
meeting
with
the
clerk
's
wife
.
<EOS>
Influenced
by
this
impression
,
and
by
no
other
,
I
had
mentioned
"
the
vestry
of
the
church
"
before
Mrs.
Catherick
on
pure
speculation
 
<EOS>
it
represented
one
of
the
minor
peculiarities
of
the
story
which
occurred
to
me
while
I
was
speaking
.
<EOS>
I
was
prepared
for
her
answering
me
confusedly
or
angrily
,
but
the
blank
terror
that
seized
her
when
I
said
the
words
took
me
completely
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
I
had
long
before
associated
Sir
Percival
's
Secret
with
the
concealment
of
a
serious
crime
which
Mrs.
Catherick
knew
of
,
<EOS>
but
I
had
gone
no
further
than
this
.
<EOS>
Now
the
woman
's
paroxysm
of
terror
associated
the
crime
,
either
directly
or
indirectly
,
with
the
vestry
,
and
convinced
me
that
she
had
been
more
than
the
mere
witness
of
it
 
<EOS>
she
was
also
the
accomplice
,
beyond
a
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
What
had
been
the
nature
of
the
crime
?
<EOS>
Surely
there
was
a
contemptible
side
to
it
,
as
well
as
a
dangerous
side
,
or
Mrs.
Catherick
would
not
have
repeated
my
own
words
,
referring
to
Sir
Percival
's
rank
and
power
,
with
such
marked
disdain
as
she
had
certainly
displayed
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
contemptible
crime
then
and
a
dangerous
crime
,
and
she
had
shared
in
it
,
and
it
was
associated
with
the
vestry
of
the
church
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
consideration
to
be
disposed
of
led
me
a
step
farther
from
this
point
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Catherick
's
undisguised
contempt
for
Sir
Percival
plainly
extended
to
his
mother
as
well
.
<EOS>
She
had
referred
with
the
bitterest
sarcasm
to
the
great
family
he
had
descended
from
 
"
especially
by
the
mother
's
side
.
<EOS>
"
What
did
this
mean
?
  
<EOS>
There
appeared
to
be
only
two
explanations
of
it
.
<EOS>
Either
his
mother
's
birth
had
been
low
,
or
his
mother
's
reputation
was
damaged
by
some
hidden
flaw
with
which
Mrs.
Catherick
and
Sir
Percival
were
both
privately
acquainted
?
<EOS>
I
could
only
put
the
first
explanation
to
the
test
by
looking
at
the
register
of
her
marriage
,
and
so
ascertaining
her
maiden
name
and
her
parentage
as
a
preliminary
to
further
inquiries
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
if
the
second
case
supposed
were
the
true
one
,
what
had
been
the
flaw
in
her
reputation
?
<EOS>
Remembering
the
account
which
Marian
had
given
me
of
Sir
Percival
's
father
and
mother
,
and
of
the
suspiciously
unsocial
secluded
life
they
had
both
led
,
I
now
asked
myself
whether
it
might
not
be
possible
that
his
mother
had
never
been
married
at
all
.
<EOS>
Here
again
the
register
might
,
by
offering
written
evidence
of
the
marriage
,
prove
to
me
,
at
any
rate
,
that
this
doubt
had
no
foundation
in
truth
.
<EOS>
But
where
was
the
register
to
be
found
?
<EOS>
At
this
point
I
took
up
the
conclusions
which
I
had
previously
formed
,
and
the
same
mental
process
which
had
discovered
the
locality
of
the
concealed
crime
,
now
lodged
the
register
also
in
the
vestry
of
Old
Welmingham
church
.
  
<EOS>
These
were
the
results
of
my
interview
with
Mrs.
Catherick
 
these
<EOS>
were
the
various
considerations
,
all
steadily
converging
to
one
point
,
which
decided
the
course
of
my
proceedings
on
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
The
morning
was
cloudy
and
lowering
,
but
no
rain
fell
.
<EOS>
I
left
my
bag
at
the
hotel
to
wait
there
till
I
called
for
it
,
and
,
after
inquiring
the
way
,
set
forth
on
foot
for
Old
Welmingham
church
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
walk
of
rather
more
than
two
miles
,
the
ground
rising
slowly
all
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
highest
point
stood
the
church
 
an
ancient
,
weather
-
beaten
building
,
with
heavy
buttresses
at
its
sides
,
and
a
clumsy
square
tower
in
front
.
<EOS>
The
vestry
at
the
back
was
built
out
from
the
church
,
and
seemed
to
be
of
the
same
age
.
<EOS>
Round
the
building
at
intervals
appeared
the
remains
of
the
village
which
Mrs.
Clements
had
described
to
me
as
her
husband
's
place
of
abode
in
former
years
,
and
which
the
principal
inhabitants
had
long
since
deserted
for
the
new
town
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
empty
houses
had
been
dismantled
to
their
outer
walls
,
some
had
been
left
to
decay
with
time
,
and
some
were
still
inhabited
by
persons
evidently
of
the
poorest
class
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
dreary
scene
,
and
yet
,
in
the
worst
aspect
of
its
ruin
,
not
so
dreary
as
the
modern
town
that
I
had
just
left
.
<EOS>
Here
there
was
the
brown
,
breezy
sweep
of
surrounding
fields
for
the
eye
to
repose
on
 
here
the
trees
,
leafless
as
they
were
,
still
varied
the
monotony
of
the
prospect
,
and
helped
the
mind
to
look
forward
to
summer
-
time
and
shade
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
moved
away
from
the
back
of
the
church
,
and
passed
some
of
the
dismantled
cottages
in
search
of
a
person
who
might
direct
me
to
the
clerk
,
I
saw
two
men
saunter
out
after
me
from
behind
a
wall
.
<EOS>
The
tallest
of
the
two
 
a
stout
muscular
man
in
the
dress
of
a
gamekeeper
 
was
a
stranger
to
me
.
<EOS>
The
other
was
one
of
the
men
who
had
followed
me
in
London
on
the
day
when
I
left
Mr.
Kyrle
's
office
.
<EOS>
I
had
taken
particular
notice
of
him
at
the
time
;
and
I
felt
sure
that
I
was
not
mistaken
in
identifying
the
fellow
on
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Neither
he
nor
his
companion
attempted
to
speak
to
me
,
and
both
kept
themselves
at
a
respectful
distance
,
but
the
motive
of
their
presence
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
church
was
plainly
apparent
.
<EOS>
It
was
exactly
as
I
had
supposed
 
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
was
already
prepared
for
me
.
<EOS>
My
visit
to
Mrs.
Catherick
had
been
reported
to
him
the
evening
before
,
and
those
two
men
had
been
placed
on
the
look
-
out
near
the
church
in
anticipation
of
my
appearance
at
Old
Welmingham
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
wanted
any
further
proof
that
my
investigations
had
taken
the
right
direction
at
last
,
the
plan
now
adopted
for
watching
me
would
have
supplied
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
walked
on
away
from
the
church
till
I
reached
one
of
the
inhabited
houses
,
with
a
patch
of
kitchen
garden
attached
to
it
on
which
a
labourer
was
at
work
.
<EOS>
He
directed
me
to
the
clerk
's
abode
,
a
cottage
at
some
little
distance
off
,
standing
by
itself
on
the
outskirts
of
the
forsaken
village
.
<EOS>
The
clerk
was
indoors
,
and
was
just
putting
on
his
greatcoat
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
cheerful
,
familiar
,
loudly
-
talkative
old
man
,
with
a
very
poor
opinion
(
as
I
soon
discovered
)
of
the
place
in
which
he
lived
,
and
a
happy
sense
of
superiority
to
his
neighbours
in
virtue
of
the
great
personal
distinction
of
having
once
been
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
well
<EOS>
you
came
so
early
,
sir
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
when
I
had
mentioned
the
object
of
my
visit
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
been
away
in
ten
minutes
more
.
<EOS>
Parish
business
,
sir
,
and
a
goodish
long
trot
<EOS>
before
it
's
all
done
for
a
man
at
my
age
.
<EOS>
But
,
bless
you
,
I
'm
strong
on
my
legs
still
!
<EOS>
As
long
as
a
man
do
n't
give
at
his
legs
,
there
's
a
deal
of
work
left
in
him
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
so
yourself
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
his
keys
down
while
he
was
talking
from
a
hook
behind
the
fireplace
,
and
locked
his
cottage
door
behind
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
at
home
to
keep
house
for
me
,
"
said
the
clerk
,
with
a
cheerful
sense
of
perfect
freedom
from
all
family
encumbrances
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
wife
's
in
the
churchyard
there
,
and
my
children
are
all
married
.
<EOS>
A
wretched
place
this
,
is
n't
it
,
sir
?
<EOS>
But
the
parish
is
a
large
one
 
<EOS>
every
man
could
n't
get
through
the
business
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
It
's
learning
does
it
,
and
I
've
had
my
share
,
and
a
little
more
.
<EOS>
I
can
talk
the
Queen
's
English
(
God
bless
the
Queen
!
)
,
and
that
's
more
than
most
of
the
people
about
here
can
do
.
<EOS>
You
're
from
London
,
I
suppose
,
sir
?
<EOS>
I
've
been
in
London
a
matter
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
year
ago
.
<EOS>
What
's
the
news
there
now
,
if
you
please
?
"
  
<EOS>
Chattering
on
in
this
way
,
he
led
me
back
to
the
vestry
.
<EOS>
I
looked
about
to
see
if
the
two
spies
were
still
in
sight
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
visible
anywhere
.
<EOS>
After
having
discovered
my
application
to
the
clerk
,
they
had
probably
concealed
themselves
where
they
could
watch
my
next
proceedings
in
perfect
freedom
.
  
<EOS>
The
vestry
door
was
of
stout
old
oak
,
studded
with
strong
nails
,
and
the
clerk
put
his
large
heavy
key
into
the
lock
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
knew
that
he
had
a
difficulty
to
encounter
,
and
who
was
not
quite
certain
of
creditably
conquering
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
obliged
to
bring
you
this
way
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
"
because
the
door
from
the
vestry
to
the
church
is
bolted
on
the
vestry
side
.
<EOS>
We
might
have
got
in
through
the
church
otherwise
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
perverse
lock
,
if
ever
there
was
one
yet
.
<EOS>
It
's
big
enough
for
a
prison
-
door
 
<EOS>
it
's
been
hampered
over
and
over
again
,
and
it
ought
to
be
changed
for
a
new
one
.
<EOS>
I
've
mentioned
that
to
the
churchwarden
fifty
times
over
at
least
 
he
's
always
saying
,
"
I
'll
see
about
it
<EOS>
'
 
<EOS>
and
he
never
does
see
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
It
's
a
sort
of
lost
corner
,
this
place
.
<EOS>
Not
like
London
 
is
it
,
sir
?
<EOS>
Bless
you
,
we
are
all
asleep
here
!
<EOS>
We
do
n't
march
with
the
times
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
some
twisting
and
turning
of
the
key
,
the
heavy
lock
yielded
,
and
he
opened
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
The
vestry
was
larger
than
I
should
have
supposed
it
to
be
,
judging
from
the
outside
only
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
dim
,
mouldy
,
melancholy
old
room
,
with
a
low
,
raftered
ceiling
.
<EOS>
Round
two
sides
of
it
,
the
sides
nearest
to
the
interior
of
the
church
,
ran
heavy
wooden
presses
,
worm
-
eaten
and
gaping
with
age
.
<EOS>
Hooked
to
the
inner
corner
of
one
of
these
presses
hung
several
surplices
,
all
bulging
out
at
their
lower
ends
in
an
irreverent
-
looking
bundle
of
limp
drapery
.
<EOS>
Below
the
surplices
,
on
the
floor
,
stood
three
packing
-
cases
,
with
the
lids
half
off
,
half
on
,
and
the
straw
profusely
bursting
out
of
their
cracks
and
crevices
in
every
direction
.
<EOS>
Behind
them
,
in
a
corner
,
was
a
litter
of
dusty
papers
,
some
large
and
rolled
up
like
architects
'
plans
,
some
loosely
strung
together
on
files
like
bills
or
letters
.
<EOS>
The
room
had
once
been
lighted
by
a
small
side
window
,
but
this
had
been
bricked
up
,
and
a
lantern
skylight
was
now
substituted
for
it
.
<EOS>
The
atmosphere
of
the
place
was
heavy
and
mouldy
,
being
rendered
additionally
oppressive
by
the
closing
of
the
door
which
led
into
the
church
.
<EOS>
This
door
also
was
composed
of
solid
oak
,
and
was
bolted
at
the
top
and
bottom
on
the
vestry
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
might
be
tidier
,
might
n't
we
,
sir
?
"
said
the
cheerful
clerk
;
"
but
when
you
're
in
a
lost
corner
of
a
place
like
this
,
what
are
you
to
do
?
<EOS>
Why
,
look
here
now
,
just
look
at
these
packing
-
cases
.
<EOS>
There
they
've
been
,
for
a
year
or
more
,
ready
to
go
down
to
London
 
there
<EOS>
they
are
,
littering
the
place
,
and
there
they
'll
stop
as
long
as
the
nails
hold
them
together
.
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
<EOS>
what
,
sir
,
as
I
said
before
,
this
is
not
London
.
<EOS>
We
are
all
asleep
here
.
<EOS>
Bless
you
,
WE
do
n't
march
with
the
times
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
there
in
the
packing
-
cases
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bits
of
old
wood
carvings
from
the
pulpit
,
and
panels
from
the
chancel
,
and
images
from
the
organ
-
loft
,
"
said
the
clerk
.
<EOS>
"
Portraits
of
the
twelve
apostles
in
wood
,
and
not
a
whole
nose
among
'em
.
<EOS>
All
broken
,
and
worm
-
eaten
,
and
crumbling
to
dust
at
the
edges
.
<EOS>
As
brittle
as
crockery
,
sir
,
and
as
old
as
the
church
,
if
not
older
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
were
they
going
to
London
?
<EOS>
To
be
repaired
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
it
,
sir
,
to
be
repaired
,
and
where
they
were
past
repair
,
to
be
copied
in
sound
wood
.
<EOS>
But
,
bless
you
,
the
money
fell
short
,
and
there
they
are
,
waiting
for
new
subscriptions
,
and
nobody
to
subscribe
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
done
a
year
ago
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Six
gentlemen
dined
together
about
it
,
at
the
hotel
in
the
new
town
.
<EOS>
They
made
speeches
,
and
passed
resolutions
,
and
put
their
names
down
,
and
printed
off
thousands
of
prospectuses
.
<EOS>
Beautiful
prospectuses
,
sir
,
all
flourished
over
with
Gothic
devices
in
red
ink
,
saying
it
was
a
disgrace
not
to
restore
the
church
and
repair
the
famous
carvings
,
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
There
are
the
prospectuses
that
could
n't
be
distributed
,
and
the
architect
's
plans
and
estimates
,
and
the
whole
correspondence
which
set
everybody
at
loggerheads
and
ended
in
a
dispute
,
all
down
together
in
that
corner
,
behind
the
packing
-
cases
.
<EOS>
The
money
dribbled
in
a
little
at
first
 
<EOS>
but
what
CAN
you
expect
out
of
London
?
<EOS>
There
was
just
enough
,
you
know
,
to
pack
the
broken
carvings
,
and
get
the
estimates
,
and
pay
the
printer
's
bill
,
and
after
that
there
was
n't
a
halfpenny
left
.
<EOS>
There
the
things
are
,
as
I
said
before
.
<EOS>
We
have
nowhere
else
to
put
them
 
nobody
in
the
new
town
cares
about
accommodating
us
 
<EOS>
we
're
in
a
lost
corner
 
<EOS>
and
this
is
an
untidy
vestry
 
and
who
's
to
help
it
?
 
<EOS>
that
's
what
I
want
to
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
anxiety
to
examine
the
register
did
not
dispose
me
to
offer
much
encouragement
to
the
old
man
's
talkativeness
.
<EOS>
I
agreed
with
him
that
nobody
could
help
the
untidiness
of
the
vestry
,
and
then
suggested
that
we
should
proceed
to
our
business
without
more
delay
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
the
marriage
-
register
,
to
be
sure
,
"
said
the
clerk
,
taking
a
little
bunch
of
keys
from
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
How
far
do
you
want
to
look
back
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
Marian
had
informed
me
of
Sir
Percival
's
age
at
the
time
when
we
had
spoken
together
of
his
marriage
engagement
with
Laura
.
<EOS>
She
had
then
described
him
as
being
forty
-
five
years
old
.
<EOS>
Calculating
back
from
this
,
and
making
due
allowance
for
the
year
that
had
passed
since
I
had
gained
my
information
,
I
found
that
he
must
have
been
born
in
eighteen
hundred
and
four
,
and
that
I
might
safely
start
on
my
search
through
the
register
from
that
date
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
begin
with
the
year
eighteen
hundred
and
four
,
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Which
way
after
that
,
sir
?
"
asked
the
clerk
.
<EOS>
"
Forwards
to
our
time
or
backwards
away
from
us
?
"
  
"
Backwards
from
eighteen
hundred
and
four
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
opened
the
door
of
one
of
the
presses
 
the
press
from
the
side
of
which
the
surplices
were
hanging
 
and
produced
a
large
volume
bound
in
greasy
brown
leather
.
<EOS>
I
was
struck
by
the
insecurity
of
the
place
in
which
the
register
was
kept
.
<EOS>
The
door
of
the
press
was
warped
and
cracked
with
age
,
and
the
lock
was
of
the
smallest
and
commonest
kind
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
forced
it
easily
with
the
walking
-
stick
I
carried
in
my
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
considered
a
sufficiently
secure
place
for
the
register
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquired
.
"
<EOS>
Surely
a
book
of
such
importance
as
this
ought
to
be
protected
by
a
better
lock
,
and
kept
carefully
in
an
iron
safe
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
now
,
that
's
curious
!
"
said
the
clerk
,
shutting
up
the
book
again
,
just
after
he
had
opened
it
,
and
smacking
his
hand
cheerfully
on
the
cover
.
<EOS>
"
Those
were
the
very
words
my
old
master
was
always
saying
years
and
years
ago
,
when
I
was
a
lad
.
"
Why
is
n't
the
register
"
(
meaning
this
register
here
,
under
my
hand
)
 
<EOS>
"
why
is
n't
it
kept
in
an
iron
safe
?
<EOS>
"
If
I
've
heard
him
say
that
once
,
I
've
heard
him
say
it
a
hundred
times
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
solicitor
in
those
days
,
sir
,
who
had
the
appointment
of
vestry
-
clerk
to
this
church
.
<EOS>
A
fine
hearty
old
gentleman
,
and
the
most
particular
man
breathing
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
he
lived
he
kept
a
copy
of
this
book
in
his
office
at
Knowlesbury
,
and
had
it
posted
up
regular
,
from
time
to
time
,
to
correspond
with
the
fresh
entries
here
.
<EOS>
You
would
hardly
think
it
,
but
he
had
his
own
appointed
days
,
once
or
twice
in
every
quarter
,
for
riding
over
to
this
church
on
his
old
white
pony
,
to
check
the
copy
,
by
the
register
,
with
his
own
eyes
and
hands
.
<EOS>
"
How
do
I
know
?
<EOS>
"
(
he
used
to
say
)
<EOS>
"
how
do
I
know
that
the
register
in
this
vestry
may
not
be
stolen
or
destroyed
?
<EOS>
Why
is
n't
it
kept
in
an
iron
safe
?
<EOS>
Why
ca
n't
I
make
other
people
as
careful
as
I
am
myself
?
<EOS>
Some
of
these
days
there
will
be
an
accident
happen
,
and
when
the
register
's
lost
,
then
the
parish
will
find
out
the
value
of
my
copy
.
"
<EOS>
He
used
to
take
his
pinch
of
snuff
after
that
,
and
look
about
him
as
bold
as
a
lord
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
the
like
of
him
for
doing
business
is
n't
easy
to
find
now
.
<EOS>
You
may
go
to
London
and
not
match
him
,
even
THERE
.
<EOS>
Which
year
did
you
say
,
sir
?
<EOS>
Eighteen
hundred
and
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Eighteen
hundred
and
four
,
"
I
replied
,
mentally
resolving
to
give
the
old
man
no
more
opportunities
of
talking
,
until
my
examination
of
the
register
was
over
.
  
<EOS>
The
clerk
put
on
his
spectacles
,
and
turned
over
the
leaves
of
the
register
,
carefully
wetting
his
finger
and
thumb
at
every
third
page
.
<EOS>
"
There
it
is
,
sir
,
"
said
he
,
with
another
cheerful
smack
on
the
open
volume
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
year
you
want
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
I
was
ignorant
of
the
month
in
which
Sir
Percival
was
born
,
I
began
my
backward
search
with
the
early
part
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
The
register
-
book
was
of
the
old
-
fashioned
kind
,
the
entries
being
all
made
on
blank
pages
in
manuscript
,
and
the
divisions
which
separated
them
being
indicated
by
ink
lines
drawn
across
the
page
at
the
close
of
each
entry
.
  
<EOS>
I
reached
the
beginning
of
the
year
eighteen
hundred
and
four
without
encountering
the
marriage
,
and
then
travelled
back
through
December
eighteen
hundred
and
three
 
through
November
and
October
 
through
    
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
not
through
September
also
.
<EOS>
Under
the
heading
of
that
month
in
the
year
I
found
the
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
I
looked
carefully
at
the
entry
.
<EOS>
It
was
at
the
bottom
of
a
page
,
and
was
for
want
of
room
compressed
into
a
smaller
space
than
that
occupied
by
the
marriages
above
.
<EOS>
The
marriage
immediately
before
it
was
impressed
on
my
attention
by
the
circumstance
of
the
bridegroom
's
Christian
name
being
the
same
as
my
own
.
<EOS>
The
entry
immediately
following
it
(
on
the
top
of
the
next
page
)
was
noticeable
in
another
way
from
the
large
space
it
occupied
,
the
record
in
this
case
registering
the
marriages
of
two
brothers
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
The
register
of
the
marriage
of
Sir
Felix
Glyde
was
in
no
respect
remarkable
except
for
the
narrowness
of
the
space
into
which
it
was
compressed
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
.
<EOS>
The
information
about
his
wife
was
the
usual
information
given
in
such
cases
.
<EOS>
She
was
described
as
"
Cecilia
Jane
Elster
,
of
Park
-
View
Cottages
,
Knowlesbury
,
only
daughter
of
the
late
Patrick
Elster
,
Esq
.
,
formerly
of
Bath
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
noted
down
these
particulars
in
my
pocket
-
book
,
feeling
as
I
did
so
both
doubtful
and
disheartened
about
my
next
proceedings
.
<EOS>
The
Secret
which
I
had
believed
until
this
moment
to
be
within
my
grasp
seemed
now
farther
from
my
reach
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
What
suggestions
of
any
mystery
unexplained
had
arisen
out
of
my
visit
to
the
vestry
?
<EOS>
I
saw
no
suggestions
anywhere
.
<EOS>
What
progress
had
I
made
towards
discovering
the
suspected
stain
on
the
reputation
of
Sir
Percival
's
mother
?
<EOS>
The
one
fact
I
had
ascertained
vindicated
her
reputation
.
<EOS>
Fresh
doubts
,
fresh
difficulties
,
fresh
delays
began
to
open
before
me
in
interminable
prospect
.
<EOS>
What
was
I
to
do
next
?
<EOS>
The
one
immediate
resource
left
to
me
appeared
to
be
this
.
<EOS>
I
might
institute
inquiries
about
"
Miss
Elster
of
Knowlesbury
,
"
on
the
chance
of
advancing
towards
the
main
object
of
my
investigation
,
by
first
discovering
the
secret
of
Mrs.
Catherick
's
contempt
for
Sir
Percival
's
mother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
found
what
you
wanted
,
sir
?
"
said
the
clerk
,
as
I
closed
the
register
-
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
replied
,
"
but
I
have
some
inquiries
still
to
make
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
clergyman
who
officiated
here
in
the
year
eighteen
hundred
and
three
is
no
longer
alive
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
sir
,
he
was
dead
three
or
four
years
before
I
came
here
,
and
that
was
as
long
ago
as
the
year
twenty
-
seven
.
<EOS>
I
got
this
place
,
sir
,
"
persisted
my
talkative
old
friend
,
"
through
the
clerk
before
me
leaving
it
.
<EOS>
They
say
he
was
driven
out
of
house
and
home
by
his
wife
 
<EOS>
and
she
's
living
still
down
in
the
new
town
there
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
the
rights
of
the
story
myself
 
<EOS>
all
I
know
is
I
got
the
place
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wansborough
got
it
for
me
 
<EOS>
the
son
of
my
old
master
that
I
was
tell
you
of
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
free
,
pleasant
gentleman
as
ever
lived
 
rides
to
the
hounds
,
keeps
his
pointers
and
all
that
.
<EOS>
He
's
vestry
-
clerk
here
now
as
his
father
was
before
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
not
tell
me
your
former
master
lived
at
Knowlesbury
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
calling
to
mind
the
long
story
about
the
precise
gentleman
of
the
old
school
with
which
my
talkative
friend
had
wearied
me
before
he
opened
the
register
-
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
to
be
sure
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
clerk
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Old
Mr.
Wansborough
lived
at
Knowlesbury
,
and
young
Mr.
Wansborough
lives
there
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
said
just
now
he
was
vestry
-
clerk
,
like
his
father
before
him
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
quite
sure
that
I
know
what
a
vestry
-
clerk
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
you
indeed
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
and
you
come
from
London
too
!
<EOS>
Every
parish
church
,
you
know
,
has
a
vestry
-
clerk
and
a
parish
-
clerk
.
<EOS>
The
parish
-
clerk
is
a
man
like
me
(
except
that
I
've
got
a
deal
more
learning
than
most
of
them
 
though
I
do
n't
boast
of
it
)
.
<EOS>
The
vestry
-
clerk
is
a
sort
of
an
appointment
that
the
lawyers
get
,
and
if
there
's
any
business
to
be
done
for
the
vestry
,
why
there
they
are
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
It
's
just
the
same
in
London
.
<EOS>
Every
parish
church
there
has
got
its
vestry
-
clerk
 
<EOS>
and
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
<EOS>
he
's
sure
to
be
a
lawyer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
young
Mr.
Wansborough
is
a
lawyer
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
is
,
sir
!
<EOS>
A
lawyer
in
High
Street
,
Knowlesbury
 
<EOS>
the
old
offices
that
his
father
had
before
him
.
<EOS>
The
number
of
times
I
've
swept
those
offices
out
,
and
seen
the
old
gentleman
come
trotting
in
to
business
on
his
white
pony
,
looking
right
and
left
all
down
the
street
and
nodding
to
everybody
!
<EOS>
Bless
you
,
he
was
a
popular
character
!
 
<EOS>
he
'd
have
done
in
London
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
far
is
it
to
Knowlesbury
from
this
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
A
long
stretch
,
sir
,
"
said
the
clerk
,
with
that
exaggerated
idea
of
distances
,
and
that
vivid
perception
of
difficulties
in
getting
from
place
to
place
,
which
is
peculiar
to
all
country
people
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nigh
on
five
mile
,
I
can
tell
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
still
early
in
the
forenoon
.
<EOS>
There
was
plenty
of
time
for
a
walk
to
Knowlesbury
and
back
again
to
Welmingham
;
and
there
was
no
person
probably
in
the
town
who
was
fitter
to
assist
my
inquiries
about
the
character
and
position
of
Sir
Percival
's
mother
before
her
marriage
than
the
local
solicitor
.
<EOS>
Resolving
to
go
at
once
to
Knowlesbury
on
foot
,
I
led
the
way
out
of
the
vestry
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
kindly
,
sir
,
"
said
the
clerk
,
as
I
slipped
my
little
present
into
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
really
going
to
walk
all
the
way
to
Knowlesbury
and
back
?
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
you
're
strong
on
your
legs
,
too
 
and
what
a
blessing
that
is
,
is
n't
it
?
<EOS>
There
's
the
road
,
you
ca
n't
miss
it
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
was
going
your
way
 
<EOS>
it
's
pleasant
to
meet
with
gentlemen
from
London
in
a
lost
corner
like
this
.
<EOS>
One
hears
the
news
.
<EOS>
Wish
you
good
-
morning
,
sir
,
and
thank
you
kindly
once
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
parted
.
<EOS>
As
I
left
the
church
behind
me
I
looked
back
,
and
there
were
the
two
men
again
on
the
road
below
,
with
a
third
in
their
company
,
that
third
person
being
the
short
man
in
black
whom
I
had
traced
to
the
railway
the
evening
before
.
  
<EOS>
The
three
stood
talking
together
for
a
little
while
,
then
separated
.
<EOS>
The
man
in
black
went
away
by
himself
towards
Welmingham
 
<EOS>
the
other
two
remained
together
,
evidently
waiting
to
follow
me
as
soon
as
I
walked
on
.
  
<EOS>
I
proceeded
on
my
way
without
letting
the
fellows
see
that
I
took
any
special
notice
of
them
.
<EOS>
They
caused
me
no
conscious
irritation
of
feeling
at
that
moment
 
on
the
contrary
,
they
rather
revived
my
sinking
hopes
.
<EOS>
In
the
surprise
of
discovering
the
evidence
of
the
marriage
,
I
had
forgotten
the
inference
I
had
drawn
on
first
perceiving
the
men
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
vestry
.
<EOS>
Their
reappearance
reminded
me
that
Sir
Percival
had
anticipated
my
visit
to
Old
Welmingham
church
as
the
next
result
of
my
interview
with
Mrs.
Catherick
 
otherwise
he
would
never
have
placed
his
spies
there
to
wait
for
me
.
<EOS>
Smoothly
and
fairly
as
appearances
looked
in
the
vestry
,
there
was
something
wrong
beneath
them
 
<EOS>
there
was
something
in
the
register
-
book
,
for
aught
I
knew
,
that
I
had
not
discovered
yet
.
    
<EOS>
Once
out
of
sight
of
the
church
,
I
pressed
forward
briskly
on
my
way
to
Knowlesbury
.
  
<EOS>
The
road
was
,
for
the
most
part
,
straight
and
level
.
<EOS>
Whenever
I
looked
back
over
it
I
saw
the
two
spies
steadily
following
me
.
<EOS>
For
the
greater
part
of
the
way
they
kept
at
a
safe
distance
behind
.
<EOS>
But
once
or
twice
they
quickened
their
pace
,
as
if
with
the
purpose
of
overtaking
me
,
then
stopped
,
consulted
together
,
and
fell
back
again
to
their
former
position
.
<EOS>
They
had
some
special
object
evidently
in
view
,
and
they
seemed
to
be
hesitating
or
differing
about
the
best
means
of
accomplishing
it
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
guess
exactly
what
their
design
might
be
,
but
I
felt
serious
doubts
of
reaching
Knowlesbury
without
some
mischance
happening
to
me
on
the
way
.
<EOS>
These
doubts
were
realised
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
just
entered
on
a
lonely
part
of
the
road
,
with
a
sharp
turn
at
some
distance
ahead
,
and
had
just
concluded
(
calculating
by
time
)
that
I
must
be
getting
near
to
the
town
,
when
I
suddenly
heard
the
steps
of
the
men
close
behind
me
.
  
<EOS>
Before
I
could
look
round
,
one
of
them
(
the
man
by
whom
I
had
been
followed
in
London
)
passed
rapidly
on
my
left
side
and
hustled
me
with
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
more
irritated
by
the
manner
in
which
he
and
his
companion
had
dogged
my
steps
all
the
way
from
Old
Welmingham
than
I
was
myself
aware
of
,
and
I
unfortunately
pushed
the
fellow
away
smartly
with
my
open
hand
.
<EOS>
He
instantly
shouted
for
help
.
<EOS>
His
companion
,
the
tall
man
in
the
gamekeeper
's
clothes
,
sprang
to
my
right
side
,
and
the
next
moment
the
two
scoundrels
held
me
pinioned
between
them
in
the
middle
of
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
The
conviction
that
a
trap
had
been
laid
for
me
,
and
the
vexation
of
knowing
that
I
had
fallen
into
it
,
fortunately
restrained
me
from
making
my
position
still
worse
by
an
unavailing
struggle
with
two
men
,
one
of
whom
would
,
in
all
probability
,
have
been
more
than
a
match
for
me
single
-
handed
.
<EOS>
I
repressed
the
first
natural
movement
by
which
I
had
attempted
to
shake
them
off
,
and
looked
about
to
see
if
there
was
any
person
near
to
whom
I
could
appeal
.
  
<EOS>
A
labourer
was
at
work
in
an
adjoining
field
who
must
have
witnessed
all
that
had
passed
.
<EOS>
I
called
to
him
to
follow
us
to
the
town
.
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
with
stolid
obstinacy
,
and
walked
away
in
the
direction
of
a
cottage
which
stood
back
from
the
high
-
road
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
the
men
who
held
me
between
them
declared
their
intention
of
charging
me
with
an
assault
.
<EOS>
I
was
cool
enough
and
wise
enough
now
to
make
no
opposition
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Drop
your
hold
of
my
arms
,
"
I
said
,
"
and
I
will
go
with
you
to
the
town
.
<EOS>
"
The
man
in
the
gamekeeper
's
dress
roughly
refused
.
<EOS>
But
the
shorter
man
was
sharp
enough
to
look
to
consequences
,
and
not
to
let
his
companion
commit
himself
by
unnecessary
violence
.
<EOS>
He
made
a
sign
to
the
other
,
and
I
walked
on
between
them
with
my
arms
free
.
  
<EOS>
We
reached
the
turning
in
the
road
,
and
there
,
close
before
us
,
were
the
suburbs
of
Knowlesbury
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
local
policemen
was
walking
along
the
path
by
the
roadside
.
<EOS>
The
men
at
once
appealed
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
replied
that
the
magistrate
was
then
sitting
at
the
town
-
hall
,
and
recommended
that
we
should
appear
before
him
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
We
went
on
to
the
town
-
hall
.
<EOS>
The
clerk
made
out
a
formal
summons
,
and
the
charge
was
preferred
against
me
,
with
the
customary
exaggeration
and
the
customary
perversion
of
the
truth
on
such
occasions
.
<EOS>
The
magistrate
(
an
ill
-
tempered
man
,
with
a
sour
enjoyment
in
the
exercise
of
his
own
power
)
inquired
if
any
one
on
or
near
the
road
had
witnessed
the
assault
,
and
,
greatly
to
my
surprise
,
the
complainant
admitted
the
presence
of
the
labourer
in
the
field
.
<EOS>
I
was
enlightened
,
however
,
as
to
the
object
of
the
admission
by
the
magistrate
's
next
words
.
<EOS>
He
remanded
me
at
once
for
the
production
of
the
witness
,
expressing
,
at
the
same
time
,
his
willingness
to
take
bail
for
my
reappearance
if
I
could
produce
one
responsible
surety
to
offer
it
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
known
in
the
town
he
would
have
liberated
me
on
my
own
recognisances
,
but
as
I
was
a
total
stranger
<EOS>
it
was
necessary
that
I
should
find
responsible
bail
.
  
<EOS>
The
whole
object
of
the
stratagem
was
now
disclosed
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
so
managed
as
to
make
a
remand
necessary
in
a
town
where
I
was
a
perfect
stranger
,
and
where
I
could
not
hope
to
get
my
liberty
on
bail
.
<EOS>
The
remand
merely
extended
over
three
days
,
until
the
next
sitting
of
the
magistrate
.
<EOS>
But
in
that
time
,
while
I
was
in
confinement
,
Sir
Percival
might
use
any
means
he
pleased
to
embarrass
my
future
proceedings
 
perhaps
to
screen
himself
from
detection
altogether
 
without
the
slightest
fear
of
any
hindrance
on
my
part
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
the
three
days
the
charge
would
,
no
doubt
,
be
withdrawn
,
and
the
attendance
of
the
witness
would
be
perfectly
useless
.
  
<EOS>
My
indignation
,
I
may
almost
say
,
my
despair
,
at
this
mischievous
check
to
all
further
progress
 
so
base
and
trifling
in
itself
,
and
yet
so
disheartening
and
so
serious
in
its
probable
results
 
<EOS>
quite
unfitted
me
at
first
to
reflect
on
the
best
means
of
extricating
myself
from
the
dilemma
in
which
I
now
stood
.
<EOS>
I
had
the
folly
to
call
for
writing
materials
,
and
to
think
of
privately
communicating
my
real
position
to
the
magistrate
.
<EOS>
The
hopelessness
and
the
imprudence
of
this
proceeding
failed
to
strike
me
before
I
had
actually
written
the
opening
lines
of
the
letter
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
I
had
pushed
the
paper
away
 
not
till
,
I
am
ashamed
to
say
,
I
had
almost
allowed
the
vexation
of
my
helpless
position
to
conquer
me
 
that
a
course
of
action
suddenly
occurred
to
my
mind
,
which
Sir
Percival
had
probably
not
anticipated
,
and
which
might
set
me
free
again
in
a
few
hours
.
<EOS>
I
determined
to
communicate
the
situation
in
which
I
was
placed
to
Mr.
Dawson
,
of
Oak
Lodge
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
visited
this
gentleman
's
house
,
it
may
be
remembered
,
at
the
time
of
my
first
inquiries
in
the
Blackwater
Park
neighbourhood
,
and
I
had
presented
to
him
a
letter
of
introduction
from
Miss
Halcombe
,
in
which
she
recommended
me
to
his
friendly
attention
in
the
strongest
terms
.
<EOS>
I
now
wrote
,
referring
to
this
letter
,
and
to
what
I
had
previously
told
Mr.
Dawson
of
the
delicate
and
dangerous
nature
of
my
inquiries
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
revealed
to
him
the
truth
about
Laura
,
having
merely
described
my
errand
as
being
of
the
utmost
importance
to
private
family
interests
with
which
Miss
Halcombe
was
concerned
.
<EOS>
Using
the
same
caution
still
,
I
now
accounted
for
my
presence
at
Knowlesbury
in
the
same
manner
,
and
I
put
it
to
the
doctor
to
say
whether
the
trust
reposed
in
me
by
a
lady
whom
he
well
knew
,
and
the
hospitality
I
had
myself
received
in
his
house
,
justified
me
or
not
in
asking
him
to
come
to
my
assistance
in
a
place
where
I
was
quite
friendless
.
  
<EOS>
I
obtained
permission
to
hire
a
messenger
to
drive
away
at
once
with
my
letter
in
a
conveyance
which
might
be
used
to
bring
the
doctor
back
immediately
.
<EOS>
Oak
Lodge
was
on
the
Knowlesbury
side
of
Blackwater
.
<EOS>
The
man
declared
he
could
drive
there
in
forty
minutes
,
and
could
bring
Mr.
Dawson
back
in
forty
more
.
<EOS>
I
directed
him
to
follow
the
doctor
wherever
he
might
happen
to
be
,
if
he
was
not
at
home
,
and
then
sat
down
to
wait
for
the
result
with
all
the
patience
and
all
the
hope
that
I
could
summon
to
help
me
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
quite
half
-
past
one
when
the
messenger
departed
.
<EOS>
Before
half
-
past
three
he
returned
,
and
brought
the
doctor
with
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
's
kindness
,
and
the
delicacy
with
which
he
treated
his
prompt
assistance
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
,
almost
overpowered
me
.
<EOS>
The
bail
required
was
offered
,
and
accepted
immediately
.
<EOS>
Before
four
o'clock
,
on
that
afternoon
,
I
was
shaking
hands
warmly
with
the
good
old
doctor
 
a
free
man
again
 
in
the
streets
of
Knowlesbury
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Dawson
hospitably
invited
me
to
go
back
with
him
to
Oak
Lodge
,
and
take
up
my
quarters
there
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
I
could
only
reply
that
my
time
was
not
my
own
,
and
I
could
only
ask
him
to
let
me
pay
my
visit
in
a
few
days
,
when
I
might
repeat
my
thanks
,
and
offer
to
him
all
the
explanations
which
I
felt
to
be
only
his
due
,
but
which
I
was
not
then
in
a
position
to
make
.
<EOS>
We
parted
with
friendly
assurances
on
both
sides
,
and
I
turned
my
steps
at
once
to
Mr.
Wansborough
's
office
in
the
High
Street
.
  
<EOS>
Time
was
now
of
the
last
importance
.
  
<EOS>
The
news
of
my
being
free
on
bail
would
reach
Sir
Percival
,
to
an
absolute
certainty
,
before
night
.
<EOS>
If
the
next
few
hours
did
not
put
me
in
a
position
to
justify
his
worst
fears
,
and
to
hold
him
helpless
at
my
mercy
,
I
might
lose
every
inch
of
the
ground
I
had
gained
,
never
to
recover
it
again
.
<EOS>
The
unscrupulous
nature
of
the
man
,
the
local
influence
he
possessed
,
the
desperate
peril
of
exposure
with
which
my
blindfold
inquiries
threatened
him
 
all
warned
me
to
press
on
to
positive
discovery
,
without
the
useless
waste
of
a
single
minute
.
<EOS>
I
had
found
time
to
think
while
I
was
waiting
for
Mr.
Dawson
's
arrival
,
and
I
had
well
employed
it
.
<EOS>
Certain
portions
of
the
conversation
of
the
talkative
old
clerk
,
which
had
wearied
me
at
the
time
,
now
recurred
to
my
memory
with
a
new
significance
,
and
a
suspicion
crossed
my
mind
darkly
which
had
not
occurred
to
me
while
I
was
in
the
vestry
.
<EOS>
On
my
way
to
Knowlesbury
,
I
had
only
proposed
to
apply
to
Mr.
Wansborough
for
information
on
the
subject
of
Sir
Percival
's
mother
.
<EOS>
My
object
now
was
to
examine
the
duplicate
register
of
Old
Welmingham
Church
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wansborough
was
in
his
office
when
I
inquired
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
a
jovial
,
red
-
faced
,
easy
-
looking
man
 
more
like
a
country
squire
than
a
lawyer
 
<EOS>
and
he
seemed
to
be
both
surprised
and
amused
by
my
application
.
<EOS>
He
had
heard
of
his
father
's
copy
of
the
register
,
but
had
not
even
seen
it
himself
.
<EOS>
It
had
never
been
inquired
after
,
and
it
was
no
doubt
in
the
strong
room
among
other
papers
that
had
not
been
disturbed
since
his
father
's
death
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
pity
(
Mr.
Wansborough
said
)
that
the
old
gentleman
was
not
alive
to
hear
his
precious
copy
asked
for
at
last
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
ridden
his
favourite
hobby
harder
than
ever
now
.
<EOS>
How
had
I
come
to
hear
of
the
copy
?
<EOS>
was
it
through
anybody
in
the
town
?
  
<EOS>
I
parried
the
question
as
well
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
at
this
stage
of
the
investigation
to
be
too
cautious
,
and
it
was
just
as
well
not
to
let
Mr.
Wansborough
know
prematurely
that
I
had
already
examined
the
original
register
.
<EOS>
I
described
myself
,
therefore
,
as
pursuing
a
family
inquiry
,
to
the
object
of
which
every
possible
saving
of
time
was
of
great
importance
.
<EOS>
I
was
anxious
to
send
certain
particulars
to
London
by
that
day
's
post
,
and
one
look
at
the
duplicate
register
(
paying
,
of
course
,
the
necessary
fees
)
might
supply
what
I
required
,
and
save
me
a
further
journey
to
Old
Welmingham
.
<EOS>
I
added
that
,
in
the
event
of
my
subsequently
requiring
a
copy
of
the
original
register
,
I
should
make
application
to
Mr.
Wansborough
's
office
to
furnish
me
with
the
document
.
  
<EOS>
After
this
explanation
no
objection
was
made
to
producing
the
copy
.
<EOS>
A
clerk
was
sent
to
the
strong
room
,
and
after
some
delay
returned
with
the
volume
.
<EOS>
It
was
of
exactly
the
same
size
as
the
volume
in
the
vestry
,
the
only
difference
being
that
the
copy
was
more
smartly
bound
.
<EOS>
I
took
it
with
me
to
an
unoccupied
desk
.
<EOS>
My
hands
were
trembling
 
my
head
was
burning
hot
 
<EOS>
I
felt
the
necessity
of
concealing
my
agitation
as
well
as
I
could
from
the
persons
about
me
in
the
room
,
before
I
ventured
on
opening
the
book
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
blank
page
at
the
beginning
,
to
which
I
first
turned
,
were
traced
some
lines
in
faded
ink
.
<EOS>
They
contained
these
words
    
"
Copy
of
the
Marriage
Register
of
Welmingham
Parish
Church
.
<EOS>
Executed
under
my
orders
,
and
afterwards
compared
,
entry
by
entry
,
with
the
original
,
by
myself
.
<EOS>
(
Signed
)
<EOS>
Robert
Wansborough
,
vestry
-
clerk
.
<EOS>
"
Below
this
note
there
was
a
line
added
,
in
another
handwriting
,
as
follows
:
"
Extending
from
the
first
of
January
,
1800
,
to
the
thirtieth
of
June
,
1815
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
turned
to
the
month
of
September
,
eighteen
hundred
and
three
.
<EOS>
I
found
the
marriage
of
the
man
whose
Christian
name
was
the
same
as
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
found
the
double
register
of
the
marriages
of
the
two
brothers
.
<EOS>
And
between
these
entries
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
?
  
<EOS>
Nothing
!
<EOS>
Not
a
vestige
of
the
entry
which
recorded
the
marriage
of
Sir
Felix
Glyde
and
Cecilia
Jane
Elster
in
the
register
of
the
church
!
  
<EOS>
My
heart
gave
a
great
bound
,
and
throbbed
as
if
it
would
stifle
me
.
<EOS>
I
looked
again
 
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
to
believe
the
evidence
of
my
own
eyes
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
not
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
The
marriage
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
The
entries
on
the
copy
occupied
exactly
the
same
places
on
the
page
as
the
entries
in
the
original
.
<EOS>
The
last
entry
on
one
page
recorded
the
marriage
of
the
man
with
my
Christian
name
.
<EOS>
Below
it
there
was
a
blank
space
 
<EOS>
a
space
evidently
left
because
it
was
too
narrow
to
contain
the
entry
of
the
marriages
of
the
two
brothers
,
which
in
the
copy
,
as
in
the
original
,
occupied
the
top
of
the
next
page
.
<EOS>
That
space
told
the
whole
story
!
<EOS>
There
it
must
have
remained
in
the
church
register
from
eighteen
hundred
and
three
(
when
the
marriages
had
been
solemnised
and
the
copy
had
been
made
)
to
eighteen
hundred
and
twenty
-
seven
,
when
Sir
Percival
appeared
at
Old
Welmingham
.
<EOS>
Here
,
at
Knowlesbury
,
was
the
chance
of
committing
the
forgery
shown
to
me
in
the
copy
,
and
there
,
at
Old
Welmingham
,
was
the
forgery
committed
in
the
register
of
the
church
.
  
<EOS>
My
head
turned
giddy
 
<EOS>
I
held
by
the
desk
to
keep
myself
from
falling
.
<EOS>
Of
all
the
suspicions
which
had
struck
me
in
relation
to
that
desperate
man
,
not
one
had
been
near
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
The
idea
that
he
was
not
Sir
Percival
Glyde
at
all
,
that
he
had
no
more
claim
to
the
baronetcy
and
to
Blackwater
Park
than
the
poorest
labourer
who
worked
on
the
estate
,
had
never
once
occurred
to
my
mind
.
<EOS>
At
one
time
I
had
thought
he
might
be
Anne
Catherick
's
father
 
at
another
time
I
had
thought
he
might
have
been
<EOS>
Anne
Catherick
's
husband
 
the
offence
of
which
he
was
really
guilty
had
been
,
from
first
to
last
,
beyond
the
widest
reach
of
my
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
The
paltry
means
by
which
the
fraud
had
been
effected
,
the
magnitude
and
daring
of
the
crime
that
it
represented
,
the
horror
of
the
consequences
involved
in
its
discovery
,
overwhelmed
me
.
<EOS>
Who
could
wonder
now
at
the
brute
-
restlessness
of
the
wretch
's
life
 
at
his
desperate
alternations
between
abject
duplicity
and
reckless
violence
 
at
the
madness
of
guilty
distrust
which
had
made
him
imprison
Anne
Catherick
in
the
Asylum
,
and
had
given
him
over
to
the
vile
conspiracy
against
his
wife
,
on
the
bare
suspicion
that
the
one
and
the
other
knew
his
terrible
secret
?
<EOS>
The
disclosure
of
that
secret
might
,
in
past
years
,
have
hanged
him
 
might
now
transport
him
for
life
.
<EOS>
The
disclosure
of
that
secret
,
even
if
the
sufferers
by
his
deception
spared
him
the
penalties
of
the
law
,
would
deprive
him
at
one
blow
of
the
name
,
the
rank
,
the
estate
,
the
whole
social
existence
that
he
had
usurped
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
Secret
,
and
it
was
mine
!
<EOS>
A
word
from
me
,
and
house
,
lands
,
baronetcy
,
were
gone
from
him
for
ever
 
a
word
from
me
,
and
he
was
driven
out
into
the
world
,
a
nameless
,
penniless
,
friendless
outcast
!
<EOS>
The
man
's
whole
future
hung
on
my
lips
 
<EOS>
and
he
knew
it
by
this
time
as
certainly
as
I
did
!
  
<EOS>
That
last
thought
steadied
me
.
<EOS>
Interests
far
more
precious
than
my
own
depended
on
the
caution
which
must
now
guide
my
slightest
actions
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
possible
treachery
which
Sir
Percival
might
not
attempt
against
me
.
<EOS>
In
the
danger
and
desperation
of
his
position
he
would
be
staggered
by
no
risks
,
he
would
recoil
at
no
crime
 
he
would
literally
hesitate
at
nothing
to
save
himself
.
  
<EOS>
I
considered
for
a
minute
.
<EOS>
My
first
necessity
was
to
secure
positive
evidence
in
writing
of
the
discovery
that
I
had
just
made
,
and
in
the
event
of
any
personal
misadventure
happening
to
me
,
to
place
that
evidence
beyond
Sir
Percival
's
reach
.
<EOS>
The
copy
of
the
register
was
sure
to
be
safe
in
Mr.
Wansborough
's
strong
room
.
<EOS>
But
the
position
of
the
original
in
the
vestry
was
,
as
I
had
seen
with
my
own
eyes
,
anything
but
secure
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
emergency
I
resolved
to
return
to
the
church
,
to
apply
again
to
the
clerk
,
and
to
take
the
necessary
extract
from
the
register
before
I
slept
that
night
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
then
aware
that
a
legally
-
certified
copy
was
necessary
,
and
that
no
document
merely
drawn
out
by
myself
could
claim
the
proper
importance
as
a
proof
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
aware
of
this
,
and
my
determination
to
keep
my
present
proceedings
a
secret
prevented
me
from
asking
any
questions
which
might
have
procured
the
necessary
information
.
<EOS>
My
one
anxiety
was
the
anxiety
to
get
back
to
Old
Welmingham
.
<EOS>
I
made
the
best
excuses
I
could
for
the
discomposure
in
my
face
and
manner
which
Mr.
Wansborough
had
already
noticed
,
laid
the
necessary
fee
on
his
table
,
arranged
that
I
should
write
to
him
in
a
day
or
two
,
and
left
the
office
,
with
my
head
in
a
whirl
and
my
blood
throbbing
through
my
veins
at
fever
heat
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
just
getting
dark
.
<EOS>
The
idea
occurred
to
me
that
I
might
be
followed
again
and
attacked
on
the
high
-
road
.
  
<EOS>
My
walking
-
stick
was
a
light
one
,
of
little
or
no
use
for
purposes
of
defence
.
<EOS>
I
stopped
before
leaving
Knowlesbury
and
bought
a
stout
country
cudgel
,
short
,
and
heavy
at
the
head
.
<EOS>
With
this
homely
weapon
,
if
any
one
man
tried
to
stop
me
I
was
a
match
for
him
.
<EOS>
If
more
than
one
attacked
me
I
could
trust
to
my
heels
.
<EOS>
In
my
school
-
days
I
had
been
a
noted
runner
,
and
I
had
not
wanted
for
practice
since
in
the
later
time
of
my
experience
in
Central
America
.
  
<EOS>
I
started
from
the
town
at
a
brisk
pace
,
and
kept
the
middle
of
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
A
small
misty
rain
was
falling
,
and
it
was
impossible
for
the
first
half
of
the
way
to
make
sure
whether
I
was
followed
or
not
.
<EOS>
But
at
the
last
half
of
my
journey
,
when
I
supposed
myself
to
be
about
two
miles
from
the
church
,
I
saw
a
man
run
by
me
in
the
rain
,
and
then
heard
the
gate
of
a
field
by
the
roadside
shut
to
sharply
.
<EOS>
I
kept
straight
on
,
with
my
cudgel
ready
in
my
hand
,
my
ears
on
the
alert
,
and
my
eyes
straining
to
see
through
the
mist
and
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
Before
I
had
advanced
a
hundred
yards
there
was
a
rustling
in
the
hedge
on
my
right
,
and
three
men
sprang
out
into
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
I
drew
aside
on
the
instant
to
the
footpath
.
<EOS>
The
two
foremost
men
were
carried
beyond
me
before
they
could
check
themselves
.
<EOS>
The
third
was
as
quick
as
lightning
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
,
half
turned
,
and
struck
at
me
with
his
stick
.
<EOS>
The
blow
was
aimed
at
hazard
,
and
was
not
a
severe
one
.
<EOS>
It
fell
on
my
left
shoulder
.
<EOS>
I
returned
it
heavily
on
his
head
.
<EOS>
He
staggered
back
and
jostled
his
two
companions
just
as
they
were
both
rushing
at
me
.
<EOS>
This
circumstance
gave
me
a
moment
's
start
.
<EOS>
I
slipped
by
them
,
and
took
to
the
middle
of
the
road
again
at
the
top
of
my
speed
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
unhurt
men
pursued
me
.
<EOS>
They
were
both
good
runners
 
<EOS>
the
road
was
smooth
and
level
,
and
for
the
first
five
minutes
or
more
I
was
conscious
that
I
did
not
gain
on
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
perilous
work
to
run
for
long
in
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
I
could
barely
see
the
dim
black
line
of
the
hedges
on
either
side
,
and
any
chance
obstacle
in
the
road
would
have
thrown
me
down
to
a
certainty
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
I
felt
the
ground
changing
 
it
descended
from
the
level
at
a
turn
,
and
then
rose
again
beyond
.
<EOS>
Downhill
the
men
rather
gained
on
me
,
but
uphill
<EOS>
I
began
to
distance
them
.
<EOS>
The
rapid
,
regular
thump
of
their
feet
grew
fainter
on
my
ear
,
and
I
calculated
by
the
sound
that
I
was
far
enough
in
advance
to
take
to
the
fields
with
a
good
chance
of
their
passing
me
in
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
Diverging
to
the
footpath
,
I
made
for
the
first
break
that
I
could
guess
at
,
rather
than
see
,
in
the
hedge
.
<EOS>
It
proved
to
be
a
closed
gate
.
<EOS>
I
vaulted
over
,
and
finding
myself
in
a
field
,
kept
across
it
steadily
with
my
back
to
the
road
.
<EOS>
I
heard
the
men
pass
the
gate
,
still
running
,
then
in
a
minute
more
heard
one
of
them
call
to
the
other
to
come
back
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
matter
what
they
did
now
<EOS>
,
I
was
out
of
their
sight
and
out
of
their
hearing
.
<EOS>
I
kept
straight
across
the
field
,
and
when
I
had
reached
the
farther
extremity
of
it
,
waited
there
for
a
minute
to
recover
my
breath
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
venture
back
to
the
road
,
but
I
was
determined
nevertheless
to
get
to
Old
Welmingham
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
Neither
moon
nor
stars
appeared
to
guide
me
.
<EOS>
I
only
knew
that
I
had
kept
the
wind
and
rain
at
my
back
on
leaving
Knowlesbury
,
and
if
I
now
kept
them
at
my
back
still
,
I
might
at
least
be
certain
of
not
advancing
altogether
in
the
wrong
direction
.
  
<EOS>
Proceeding
on
this
plan
,
I
crossed
the
country
 
meeting
with
no
worse
obstacles
than
hedges
,
ditches
,
and
thickets
,
which
every
now
and
then
obliged
me
to
alter
my
course
for
a
little
while
 
until
I
found
myself
on
a
hill
-
side
,
with
the
ground
sloping
away
steeply
before
me
.
<EOS>
I
descended
to
the
bottom
of
the
hollow
,
squeezed
my
way
through
a
hedge
,
and
got
out
into
a
lane
.
<EOS>
Having
turned
to
the
right
on
leaving
the
road
,
I
now
turned
to
the
left
,
on
the
chance
of
regaining
the
line
from
which
I
had
wandered
.
<EOS>
After
following
the
muddy
windings
of
the
lane
for
ten
minutes
or
more
,
I
saw
a
cottage
with
a
light
in
one
of
the
windows
.
<EOS>
The
garden
gate
was
open
to
the
lane
,
and
I
went
in
at
once
to
inquire
my
way
.
  
<EOS>
Before
I
could
knock
at
the
door
it
was
suddenly
opened
,
and
a
man
came
running
out
with
a
lighted
lantern
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
and
held
it
up
at
the
sight
of
me
.
<EOS>
We
both
started
as
we
saw
each
other
.
<EOS>
My
wanderings
had
led
me
round
the
outskirts
of
the
village
,
and
had
brought
me
out
at
the
lower
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
was
back
at
Old
Welmingham
,
and
the
man
with
the
lantern
was
no
other
than
my
acquaintance
of
the
morning
,
the
parish
clerk
.
  
<EOS>
His
manner
appeared
to
have
altered
strangely
in
the
interval
since
I
had
last
seen
him
.
<EOS>
He
looked
suspicious
and
confused
 
his
ruddy
cheeks
were
deeply
flushed
 
and
<EOS>
his
first
words
,
when
he
spoke
,
were
quite
unintelligible
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
are
the
keys
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
taken
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
keys
?
<EOS>
"
I
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
this
moment
come
from
Knowlesbury
.
<EOS>
What
keys
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
keys
of
the
vestry
.
<EOS>
Lord
save
us
and
help
us
!
<EOS>
what
shall
I
do
?
<EOS>
The
keys
are
gone
!
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
?
"
cried
the
old
man
,
shaking
the
lantern
at
me
in
his
agitation
,
"
the
keys
are
gone
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
?
<EOS>
When
?
<EOS>
Who
can
have
taken
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
the
clerk
,
staring
about
him
wildly
in
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
only
just
got
back
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
I
had
a
long
day
's
work
this
morning
 
<EOS>
I
locked
the
door
and
shut
the
window
down
 
<EOS>
it
's
open
now
,
the
window
's
open
.
<EOS>
Look
!
<EOS>
somebody
has
got
in
there
and
taken
the
keys
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
turned
to
the
casement
window
to
show
me
that
it
was
wide
open
.
<EOS>
The
door
of
the
lantern
came
loose
from
its
fastening
as
he
swayed
it
round
,
and
the
wind
blew
the
candle
out
instantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Get
another
light
,
"
I
said
,
"
and
let
us
both
go
to
the
vestry
together
.
<EOS>
Quick
!
<EOS>
quick
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
hurried
him
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
treachery
that
I
had
every
reason
to
expect
,
the
treachery
that
might
deprive
me
of
every
advantage
I
had
gained
,
was
at
that
moment
,
perhaps
,
in
process
of
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
My
impatience
to
reach
the
church
was
so
great
that
I
could
not
remain
inactive
in
the
cottage
while
the
clerk
lit
the
lantern
again
.
<EOS>
I
walked
out
,
down
the
garden
path
,
into
the
lane
.
  
<EOS>
Before
I
had
advanced
ten
paces
a
man
approached
me
from
the
direction
leading
to
the
church
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
respectfully
as
we
met
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
his
face
,
but
judging
by
his
voice
only
,
he
was
a
perfect
stranger
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Sir
Percival
 
<EOS>
"
he
began
.
  
<EOS>
I
stopped
him
before
he
could
say
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
darkness
misleads
you
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
Sir
Percival
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
drew
back
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
was
my
master
,
"
he
muttered
,
in
a
confused
,
doubtful
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
expected
to
meet
your
master
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
told
to
wait
in
the
lane
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
answer
he
retraced
his
steps
.
<EOS>
I
looked
back
at
the
cottage
and
saw
the
clerk
coming
out
,
with
the
lantern
lighted
once
more
.
<EOS>
I
took
the
old
man
's
arm
to
help
him
on
the
more
quickly
.
<EOS>
We
hastened
along
the
lane
,
and
passed
the
person
who
had
accosted
me
.
<EOS>
As
well
as
I
could
see
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
,
he
was
a
servant
out
of
livery
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
that
?
"
whispered
the
clerk
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Does
he
know
anything
about
the
keys
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
wo
n't
wait
to
ask
him
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
go
on
to
the
vestry
first
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
church
was
not
visible
,
even
by
daytime
,
until
the
end
of
the
lane
was
reached
.
<EOS>
As
we
mounted
the
rising
ground
which
led
to
the
building
from
that
point
,
one
of
the
village
children
 
<EOS>
a
boy
 
came
close
up
to
us
,
attracted
by
the
light
we
carried
,
and
recognised
the
clerk
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
measter
,
"
said
the
boy
,
pulling
officiously
at
the
clerk
's
coat
,
"
there
be
summun
up
yander
in
the
church
.
<EOS>
I
heerd
un
lock
the
door
on
hisself
 
<EOS>
I
heerd
un
strike
a
loight
wi
'
a
match
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
clerk
trembled
and
leaned
against
me
heavily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
!
<EOS>
come
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
encouragingly
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
not
too
late
.
<EOS>
We
will
catch
the
man
,
whoever
he
is
.
<EOS>
Keep
the
lantern
,
and
follow
me
as
fast
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
mounted
the
hill
rapidly
.
<EOS>
The
dark
mass
of
the
church
-
tower
was
the
first
object
I
discerned
dimly
against
the
night
sky
.
<EOS>
As
I
turned
aside
to
get
round
to
the
vestry
,
I
heard
heavy
footsteps
close
to
me
.
<EOS>
The
servant
had
ascended
to
the
church
after
us
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
any
harm
,
"
he
said
,
when
I
turned
round
on
him
,
"
I
'm
only
looking
for
my
master
.
"
<EOS>
The
tones
in
which
he
spoke
betrayed
unmistakable
fear
.
<EOS>
I
took
no
notice
of
him
and
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
The
instant
I
turned
the
corner
and
came
in
view
of
the
vestry
<EOS>
,
I
saw
the
lantern
-
skylight
on
the
roof
brilliantly
lit
up
from
within
.
<EOS>
It
shone
out
with
dazzling
brightness
against
the
murky
,
starless
sky
.
  
<EOS>
I
hurried
through
the
churchyard
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
got
near
there
was
a
strange
smell
stealing
out
on
the
damp
night
air
.
<EOS>
I
heard
a
snapping
noise
inside
 
<EOS>
I
saw
the
light
above
grow
brighter
and
brighter
 
<EOS>
a
pane
of
the
glass
cracked
 
<EOS>
I
ran
to
the
door
and
put
my
hand
on
it
.
<EOS>
The
vestry
was
on
fire
!
  
<EOS>
Before
I
could
move
,
before
I
could
draw
my
breath
after
that
discovery
,
I
was
horror
-
struck
by
a
heavy
thump
against
the
door
from
the
inside
.
<EOS>
I
heard
the
key
worked
violently
in
the
lock
 
<EOS>
I
heard
a
man
's
voice
behind
the
door
,
raised
to
a
dreadful
shrillness
,
screaming
for
help
.
  
<EOS>
The
servant
who
had
followed
me
staggered
back
shuddering
,
and
dropped
to
his
knees
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
God
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
"
it
's
Sir
Percival
!
"
  
<EOS>
As
the
words
passed
his
lips
the
clerk
joined
us
,
and
at
the
same
moment
there
was
another
and
a
last
grating
turn
of
the
key
in
the
lock
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Lord
have
mercy
on
his
soul
!
"
said
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
doomed
and
dead
.
<EOS>
He
has
hampered
the
lock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
rushed
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
one
absorbing
purpose
that
had
filled
all
my
thoughts
,
that
had
controlled
all
my
actions
,
for
weeks
and
weeks
past
,
vanished
in
an
instant
from
my
mind
.
<EOS>
All
remembrance
of
the
heartless
injury
the
man
's
crimes
had
inflicted
 
of
the
love
,
the
innocence
,
the
happiness
he
had
pitilessly
laid
waste
 
of
the
oath
I
had
sworn
in
my
own
heart
to
summon
him
to
the
terrible
reckoning
that
he
deserved
 
passed
from
my
memory
like
a
dream
.
<EOS>
I
remembered
nothing
but
the
horror
of
his
situation
.
<EOS>
I
felt
nothing
but
the
natural
human
impulse
to
save
him
from
a
frightful
death
.
  
<EOS>
"
Try
the
other
door
!
"
I
shouted
.
<EOS>
"
Try
the
door
into
the
church
!
<EOS>
The
lock
's
hampered
.
<EOS>
You
're
a
dead
man
if
you
waste
another
moment
on
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
had
been
no
renewed
cry
for
help
when
the
key
was
turned
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
sound
now
of
any
kind
,
to
give
token
that
he
was
still
alive
.
<EOS>
I
heard
nothing
but
the
quickening
crackle
of
the
flames
,
and
the
sharp
snap
of
the
glass
in
the
skylight
above
.
  
<EOS>
I
looked
round
at
my
two
companions
.
<EOS>
The
servant
had
risen
to
his
feet
 
he
had
taken
the
lantern
,
and
was
holding
it
up
vacantly
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
Terror
seemed
to
have
struck
him
with
downright
idiocy
 
<EOS>
he
waited
at
my
heels
,
he
followed
me
about
when
I
moved
like
a
dog
.
<EOS>
The
clerk
sat
crouched
up
on
one
of
the
tombstones
,
shivering
,
and
moaning
to
himself
.
<EOS>
The
one
moment
in
which
I
looked
at
them
was
enough
to
show
me
that
they
were
both
helpless
.
  
<EOS>
Hardly
knowing
what
I
did
,
acting
desperately
on
the
first
impulse
that
occurred
to
me
,
I
seized
the
servant
and
pushed
him
against
the
vestry
wall
.
"
<EOS>
Stoop
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
"
and
hold
by
the
stones
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
climb
over
you
to
the
roof
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
break
the
skylight
,
and
give
him
some
air
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
trembled
from
head
to
foot
,
but
he
held
firm
.
<EOS>
I
got
on
his
back
,
with
my
cudgel
in
my
mouth
,
seized
the
parapet
with
both
hands
,
and
was
instantly
on
the
roof
.
<EOS>
In
the
frantic
hurry
and
agitation
of
the
moment
,
it
never
struck
me
that
I
might
let
out
the
flame
instead
of
letting
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
I
struck
at
the
skylight
,
and
battered
in
the
cracked
,
loosened
glass
at
a
blow
.
<EOS>
The
fire
leaped
out
like
a
wild
beast
from
its
lair
.
<EOS>
If
the
wind
had
not
chanced
,
in
the
position
I
occupied
,
to
set
it
away
from
me
,
my
exertions
might
have
ended
then
and
there
.
<EOS>
I
crouched
on
the
roof
as
the
smoke
poured
out
above
me
with
the
flame
.
<EOS>
The
gleams
and
flashes
of
the
light
showed
me
the
servant
's
face
staring
up
vacantly
under
the
wall
 
<EOS>
the
clerk
risen
to
his
feet
on
the
tombstone
,
wringing
his
hands
in
despair
 
and
the
scanty
population
of
the
village
,
haggard
men
and
terrified
women
,
clustered
beyond
in
the
churchyard
 
<EOS>
all
appearing
and
disappearing
,
in
the
red
of
the
dreadful
glare
,
in
the
black
of
the
choking
smoke
.
<EOS>
And
the
man
beneath
my
feet
!
 
<EOS>
the
man
,
suffocating
,
burning
,
dying
so
near
us
all
,
so
utterly
beyond
our
reach
!
  
<EOS>
The
thought
half
maddened
me
.
<EOS>
I
lowered
myself
from
the
roof
,
by
my
hands
,
and
dropped
to
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
key
of
the
church
!
<EOS>
"
I
shouted
to
the
clerk
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
try
it
that
way
 
<EOS>
we
may
save
him
yet
if
we
can
burst
open
the
inner
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
!
"
cried
the
old
man
.
"
<EOS>
No
hope
!
<EOS>
the
church
key
and
the
vestry
key
are
on
the
same
ring
 
both
inside
there
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
sir
,
he
's
past
saving
 
<EOS>
he
's
dust
and
ashes
by
this
time
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
'll
see
the
fire
from
the
town
,
"
said
a
voice
from
among
the
men
behind
me
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
ingine
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
They
'll
save
the
church
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
called
to
that
man
 
<EOS>
HE
had
his
wits
about
him
 
<EOS>
I
called
to
him
to
come
and
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
least
before
the
town
engine
could
reach
us
.
<EOS>
The
horror
of
remaining
inactive
all
that
time
was
more
than
I
could
face
.
<EOS>
In
defiance
of
my
own
reason
I
persuaded
myself
that
the
doomed
and
lost
wretch
in
the
vestry
might
still
be
lying
senseless
on
the
floor
,
might
not
be
dead
yet
.
<EOS>
If
we
broke
open
the
door
,
might
we
save
him
?
<EOS>
I
knew
the
strength
of
the
heavy
lock
 
<EOS>
I
knew
the
thickness
of
the
nailed
oak
 
<EOS>
I
knew
the
hopelessness
of
assailing
the
one
and
the
other
by
ordinary
means
.
<EOS>
But
surely
there
were
beams
still
left
in
the
dismantled
cottages
near
the
church
?
<EOS>
What
if
we
got
one
,
and
used
it
as
a
battering
-
ram
against
the
door
?
  
<EOS>
The
thought
leaped
through
me
like
the
fire
leaping
out
of
the
shattered
skylight
.
<EOS>
I
appealed
to
the
man
who
had
spoken
first
of
the
fire
-
engine
in
the
town
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
got
your
pickaxes
handy
?
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
they
had
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
a
hatchet
,
and
a
saw
,
and
a
bit
of
rope
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
I
ran
down
among
the
villagers
,
with
the
lantern
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Five
shillings
apiece
to
every
man
who
helps
me
!
"
<EOS>
They
started
into
life
at
the
words
.
<EOS>
That
ravenous
second
hunger
of
poverty
 
the
hunger
for
money
 
roused
them
into
tumult
and
activity
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
Two
of
you
for
more
lanterns
,
if
you
have
them
!
<EOS>
Two
of
you
for
the
pickaxes
and
the
tools
!
<EOS>
The
rest
after
me
to
find
the
beam
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
They
cheered
 
with
shrill
starveling
voices
they
cheered
.
<EOS>
The
women
and
the
children
fled
back
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
We
rushed
in
a
body
down
the
churchyard
path
to
the
first
empty
cottage
.
<EOS>
Not
a
man
was
left
behind
but
the
clerk
 
the
poor
old
clerk
standing
on
the
flat
tombstone
sobbing
and
wailing
over
the
church
.
<EOS>
The
servant
was
still
at
my
heels
 
<EOS>
his
white
,
helpless
,
panic
-
stricken
face
was
close
over
my
shoulder
as
we
pushed
into
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
There
were
rafters
from
the
torn
-
down
floor
above
,
lying
loose
on
the
ground
 
<EOS>
but
they
were
too
light
.
<EOS>
A
beam
ran
across
over
our
heads
,
but
not
out
of
reach
of
our
arms
and
our
pickaxes
 
a
beam
fast
at
each
end
in
the
ruined
wall
,
with
ceiling
and
flooring
all
ripped
away
,
and
a
great
gap
in
the
roof
above
,
open
to
the
sky
.
<EOS>
We
attacked
the
beam
at
both
ends
at
once
.
<EOS>
God
!
<EOS>
how
it
held
 
how
the
brick
and
mortar
of
the
wall
resisted
us
!
<EOS>
We
struck
,
and
tugged
,
and
tore
.
<EOS>
The
beam
gave
at
one
end
 
it
came
down
with
a
lump
of
brickwork
after
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
scream
from
the
women
all
huddled
in
the
doorway
to
look
at
us
 
a
shout
from
the
men
 
<EOS>
two
of
them
down
but
not
hurt
.
<EOS>
Another
tug
all
together
 
<EOS>
and
the
beam
was
loose
at
both
ends
.
<EOS>
We
raised
it
,
and
gave
the
word
to
clear
the
doorway
.
<EOS>
Now
for
the
work
!
<EOS>
now
for
the
rush
at
the
door
!
<EOS>
There
is
the
fire
streaming
into
the
sky
,
streaming
brighter
than
ever
to
light
us
!
<EOS>
Steady
along
the
churchyard
path
 
steady
with
the
beam
for
a
rush
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
One
,
two
,
three
 
and
off
.
<EOS>
Out
rings
the
cheering
again
,
irrepressibly
.
<EOS>
We
have
shaken
it
already
,
the
hinges
must
give
if
the
lock
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
Another
run
with
the
beam
!
<EOS>
One
,
two
,
three
 
and
off
.
<EOS>
It
's
loose
!
<EOS>
the
stealthy
fire
darts
at
us
through
the
crevice
all
round
it
.
<EOS>
Another
,
and
a
last
rush
!
<EOS>
The
door
falls
in
with
a
crash
.
<EOS>
A
great
hush
of
awe
,
a
stillness
of
breathless
expectation
,
possesses
every
living
soul
of
us
.
<EOS>
We
look
for
the
body
.
<EOS>
The
scorching
heat
on
our
faces
drives
us
back
:
we
see
nothing
 
above
,
below
,
all
through
the
room
,
we
see
nothing
but
a
sheet
of
living
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
?
<EOS>
"
whispered
the
servant
,
staring
vacantly
at
the
flames
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
dust
and
ashes
,
"
said
the
clerk
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
books
are
dust
and
ashes
 
<EOS>
and
oh
,
sirs
!
<EOS>
the
church
will
be
dust
and
ashes
soon
.
"
  
<EOS>
Those
were
the
only
two
who
spoke
.
<EOS>
When
they
were
silent
again
,
nothing
stirred
in
the
stillness
but
the
bubble
and
the
crackle
of
the
flames
.
  
<EOS>
Hark
!
  
<EOS>
A
harsh
rattling
sound
in
the
distance
 
then
the
hollow
beat
of
horses
'
hoofs
at
full
gallop
 
<EOS>
then
the
low
roar
,
the
all
-
predominant
tumult
of
hundreds
of
human
voices
clamouring
and
shouting
together
.
<EOS>
The
engine
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
The
people
about
me
all
turned
from
the
fire
,
and
ran
eagerly
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
The
old
clerk
tried
to
go
with
the
rest
,
but
his
strength
was
exhausted
.
<EOS>
I
saw
him
holding
by
one
of
the
tombstones
.
<EOS>
"
Save
the
church
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
out
faintly
,
as
if
the
firemen
could
hear
him
already
.
  
<EOS>
Save
the
church
!
  
<EOS>
The
only
man
who
never
moved
was
the
servant
.
<EOS>
There
he
stood
,
his
eyes
still
fastened
on
the
flames
in
a
changeless
,
vacant
stare
.
<EOS>
I
spoke
to
him
,
I
shook
him
by
the
arm
.
<EOS>
He
was
past
rousing
.
<EOS>
He
only
whispered
once
more
,
"
Where
is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
In
ten
minutes
the
engine
was
in
position
,
the
well
at
the
back
of
the
church
was
feeding
it
,
and
the
hose
was
carried
to
the
doorway
of
the
vestry
.
<EOS>
If
help
had
been
wanted
from
me
I
could
not
have
afforded
it
now
.
<EOS>
My
energy
of
will
was
gone
 
<EOS>
my
strength
was
exhausted
 
<EOS>
the
turmoil
of
my
thoughts
was
fearfully
and
suddenly
stilled
,
now
I
knew
that
he
was
dead
.
  
<EOS>
I
stood
useless
and
helpless
 
looking
,
looking
,
looking
into
the
burning
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
saw
the
fire
slowly
conquered
.
<EOS>
The
brightness
of
the
glare
faded
 
<EOS>
the
steam
rose
in
white
clouds
,
and
the
smouldering
heaps
of
embers
showed
red
and
black
through
it
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
pause
 
then
an
advance
all
together
of
the
firemen
and
the
police
which
blocked
up
the
doorway
 
then
a
consultation
in
low
voices
 
<EOS>
and
then
two
men
were
detached
from
the
rest
,
and
sent
out
of
the
churchyard
through
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
The
crowd
drew
back
on
either
side
in
dead
silence
to
let
them
pass
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
while
a
great
shudder
ran
through
the
people
,
and
the
living
lane
widened
slowly
.
<EOS>
The
men
came
back
along
it
with
a
door
from
one
of
the
empty
houses
.
<EOS>
They
carried
it
to
the
vestry
and
went
in
.
<EOS>
The
police
closed
again
round
the
doorway
,
and
men
stole
out
from
among
the
crowd
by
twos
and
threes
and
stood
behind
them
to
be
the
first
to
see
.
<EOS>
Others
waited
near
to
be
the
first
to
hear
.
<EOS>
Women
and
children
were
among
these
last
.
  
<EOS>
The
tidings
from
the
vestry
began
to
flow
out
among
the
crowd
 
they
dropped
slowly
from
mouth
to
mouth
till
they
reached
the
place
where
I
was
standing
.
<EOS>
I
heard
the
questions
and
answers
repeated
again
and
again
in
low
,
eager
tones
all
round
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
they
found
him
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
<EOS>
"
Against
the
door
,
on
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
<EOS>
Which
door
?
"
<EOS>
"
The
door
that
goes
into
the
church
.
<EOS>
His
head
was
against
it
 
<EOS>
he
was
down
on
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
his
face
burnt
?
"
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
is
.
"
<EOS>
"
No
,
scorched
,
not
burnt
 
he
lay
on
his
face
,
I
tell
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
was
he
?
<EOS>
A
lord
,
they
say
.
"
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
a
lord
.
<EOS>
SIR
Something
;
Sir
means
Knight
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
Baronight
,
too
.
"
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
does
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
want
in
there
?
"
<EOS>
"
No
good
,
you
may
depend
on
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Did
he
do
it
on
purpose
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Burn
himself
on
purpose
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
himself
,
I
mean
the
vestry
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
he
dreadful
to
look
at
?
"
<EOS>
"
Dreadful
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
about
the
face
,
though
?
"
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
not
so
much
about
the
face
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
anybody
know
him
?
"
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
man
says
he
does
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Who
?
"
<EOS>
"
A
servant
,
they
say
.
<EOS>
But
he
's
struck
stupid
-
like
,
and
the
police
do
n't
believe
him
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
anybody
else
know
who
it
is
?
"
<EOS>
"
Hush
 
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
loud
,
clear
voice
of
a
man
in
authority
silenced
the
low
hum
of
talking
all
round
me
in
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
the
gentleman
who
tried
to
save
him
?
"
said
the
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
sir
 
here
he
is
!
"
<EOS>
Dozens
of
eager
faces
pressed
about
me
 
dozens
of
eager
arms
parted
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
The
man
in
authority
came
up
to
me
with
a
lantern
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
way
,
sir
,
if
you
please
,
"
he
said
quietly
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
unable
to
speak
to
him
,
I
was
unable
to
resist
him
when
he
took
my
arm
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
say
that
I
had
never
seen
the
dead
man
in
his
lifetime
 
<EOS>
that
there
was
no
hope
of
identifying
him
by
means
of
a
stranger
like
me
.
<EOS>
But
the
words
failed
on
my
lips
.
<EOS>
I
was
faint
,
and
silent
,
and
helpless
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
him
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
standing
inside
a
circle
of
men
.
<EOS>
Three
of
them
opposite
to
me
were
holding
lanterns
low
down
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Their
eyes
,
and
the
eyes
of
all
the
rest
,
were
fixed
silently
and
expectantly
on
my
face
.
<EOS>
I
knew
what
was
at
my
feet
 
<EOS>
I
knew
why
they
were
holding
the
lanterns
so
low
to
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
identify
him
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
My
eyes
dropped
slowly
.
<EOS>
At
first
I
saw
nothing
under
them
but
a
coarse
canvas
cloth
.
<EOS>
The
dripping
of
the
rain
on
it
was
audible
in
the
dreadful
silence
.
<EOS>
I
looked
up
,
along
the
cloth
,
and
there
at
the
end
,
stark
and
grim
and
black
,
in
the
yellow
light
 
there
was
his
dead
face
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
for
the
first
and
last
time
,
I
saw
him
.
<EOS>
So
the
Visitation
of
God
ruled
it
that
he
and
I
should
meet
.
    
<EOS>
The
inquest
was
hurried
for
certain
local
reasons
which
weighed
with
the
coroner
and
the
town
authorities
.
<EOS>
It
was
held
on
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
I
was
necessarily
one
among
the
witnesses
summoned
to
assist
the
objects
of
the
investigation
.
  
<EOS>
My
first
proceeding
in
the
morning
was
to
go
to
the
post
-
office
,
and
inquire
for
the
letter
which
I
expected
from
Marian
.
<EOS>
No
change
of
circumstances
,
however
extraordinary
,
could
affect
the
one
great
anxiety
which
weighed
on
my
mind
while
I
was
away
from
London
.
<EOS>
The
morning
's
letter
,
which
was
the
only
assurance
I
could
receive
that
no
misfortune
had
happened
in
my
absence
,
was
still
the
absorbing
interest
with
which
my
day
began
.
  
<EOS>
To
my
relief
,
the
letter
from
Marian
was
at
the
office
waiting
for
me
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
had
happened
 
they
were
both
as
safe
and
as
well
as
when
I
had
left
them
.
<EOS>
Laura
sent
her
love
,
and
begged
that
I
would
let
her
know
of
my
return
a
day
beforehand
.
<EOS>
Her
sister
added
,
in
explanation
of
this
message
,
that
she
had
saved
"
nearly
a
sovereign
"
out
of
her
own
private
purse
,
and
that
she
had
claimed
the
privilege
of
ordering
the
dinner
and
giving
the
dinner
which
was
to
celebrate
the
day
of
my
return
.
<EOS>
I
read
these
little
domestic
confidences
in
the
bright
morning
with
the
terrible
recollection
of
what
had
happened
the
evening
before
vivid
in
my
memory
.
<EOS>
The
necessity
of
sparing
Laura
any
sudden
knowledge
of
the
truth
was
the
first
consideration
which
the
letter
suggested
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
at
once
to
Marian
to
tell
her
what
I
have
told
in
these
pages
 
presenting
the
tidings
as
gradually
and
gently
as
I
could
,
and
warning
her
not
to
let
any
such
thing
as
a
newspaper
fall
in
Laura
's
way
while
I
was
absent
.
<EOS>
In
the
case
of
any
other
woman
,
less
courageous
and
less
reliable
,
I
might
have
hesitated
before
I
ventured
on
unreservedly
disclosing
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
But
I
owed
it
to
Marian
to
be
faithful
to
my
past
experience
of
her
,
and
to
trust
her
as
I
trusted
herself
.
  
<EOS>
My
letter
was
necessarily
a
long
one
.
<EOS>
It
occupied
me
until
the
time
came
for
proceeding
to
the
inquest
.
  
<EOS>
The
objects
of
the
legal
inquiry
were
necessarily
beset
by
peculiar
complications
and
difficulties
.
<EOS>
Besides
the
investigation
into
the
manner
in
which
the
deceased
had
met
his
death
,
there
were
serious
questions
to
be
settled
relating
to
the
cause
of
the
fire
,
to
the
abstraction
of
the
keys
,
and
to
the
presence
of
a
stranger
in
the
vestry
at
the
time
when
the
flames
broke
out
.
<EOS>
Even
the
identification
of
the
dead
man
had
not
yet
been
accomplished
.
<EOS>
The
helpless
condition
of
the
servant
had
made
the
police
distrustful
of
his
asserted
recognition
of
his
master
.
<EOS>
They
had
sent
to
Knowlesbury
overnight
to
secure
the
attendance
of
witnesses
who
were
well
acquainted
with
the
personal
appearance
of
Sir
Percival
Glyde
,
and
they
had
communicated
,
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
,
with
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
These
precautions
enabled
the
coroner
and
jury
to
settle
the
question
of
identity
,
and
to
confirm
the
correctness
of
the
servant
's
assertion
;
the
evidence
offered
by
competent
witnesses
,
and
by
the
discovery
of
certain
facts
,
being
subsequently
strengthened
by
an
examination
of
the
dead
man
's
watch
.
<EOS>
The
crest
and
the
name
of
Sir
Percival
Glyde
were
engraved
inside
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
inquiries
related
to
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
The
servant
and
I
,
and
the
boy
who
had
heard
the
light
struck
in
the
vestry
,
were
the
first
witnesses
called
.
<EOS>
The
boy
gave
his
evidence
clearly
enough
,
but
the
servant
's
mind
had
not
yet
recovered
the
shock
inflicted
on
it
 
<EOS>
he
was
plainly
incapable
of
assisting
the
objects
of
the
inquiry
,
and
he
was
desired
to
stand
down
.
  
<EOS>
To
my
own
relief
,
my
examination
was
not
a
long
one
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
known
the
deceased
 
<EOS>
I
had
never
seen
him
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
aware
of
his
presence
at
Old
Welmingham
 
<EOS>
and
I
had
not
been
in
the
vestry
at
the
finding
of
the
body
.
<EOS>
All
I
could
prove
was
that
I
had
stopped
at
the
clerk
's
cottage
to
ask
my
way
 
that
I
had
heard
from
him
of
the
loss
of
the
keys
 
that
I
had
accompanied
him
to
the
church
to
render
what
help
<EOS>
I
could
 
that
I
had
seen
the
fire
 
that
I
had
heard
some
person
unknown
,
inside
the
vestry
,
trying
vainly
to
unlock
the
door
 
and
that
I
had
done
what
I
could
,
from
motives
of
humanity
,
to
save
the
man
.
<EOS>
Other
witnesses
,
who
had
been
acquainted
with
the
deceased
,
were
asked
if
they
could
explain
the
mystery
of
his
presumed
abstraction
of
the
keys
,
and
his
presence
in
the
burning
room
.
<EOS>
But
the
coroner
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
,
naturally
enough
,
that
I
,
as
a
total
stranger
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
a
total
stranger
to
Sir
Percival
Glyde
,
could
not
be
in
a
position
to
offer
any
evidence
on
these
two
points
.
  
<EOS>
The
course
that
I
was
myself
bound
to
take
,
when
my
formal
examination
had
closed
,
seemed
clear
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
feel
called
on
to
volunteer
any
statement
of
my
own
private
convictions
;
in
the
first
place
,
because
my
doing
so
could
serve
no
practical
purpose
,
now
that
all
proof
in
support
of
any
surmises
of
mine
was
burnt
with
the
burnt
register
;
in
the
second
place
,
because
I
could
not
have
intelligibly
stated
my
opinion
 
my
unsupported
opinion
 
without
disclosing
the
whole
story
of
the
conspiracy
,
and
producing
beyond
a
doubt
the
same
unsatisfactory
effect
an
the
minds
of
the
coroner
and
the
jury
,
which
I
had
already
produced
on
the
mind
of
Mr.
Kyrle
.
  
<EOS>
In
these
pages
,
however
,
and
after
the
time
that
has
now
elapsed
,
no
such
cautions
and
restraints
as
are
here
described
need
fetter
the
free
expression
of
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
I
will
state
briefly
,
before
my
pen
occupies
itself
with
other
events
,
how
my
own
convictions
lead
me
to
account
for
the
abstraction
of
the
keys
,
for
the
outbreak
of
the
fire
,
and
for
the
death
of
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
The
news
of
my
being
free
on
bail
drove
Sir
Percival
,
as
I
believe
,
to
his
last
resources
.
<EOS>
The
attempted
attack
on
the
road
was
one
of
those
resources
,
and
the
suppression
of
all
practical
proof
of
his
crime
,
by
destroying
the
page
of
the
register
on
which
the
forgery
had
been
committed
,
was
the
other
,
and
the
surest
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
produce
no
extract
from
the
original
book
to
compare
with
the
certified
copy
at
Knowlesbury
,
I
could
produce
no
positive
evidence
,
and
could
threaten
him
with
no
fatal
exposure
.
<EOS>
All
that
was
necessary
to
the
attainment
of
his
end
was
,
that
he
should
get
into
the
vestry
unperceived
,
that
he
should
tear
out
the
page
in
the
register
,
and
that
he
should
leave
the
vestry
again
as
privately
as
he
had
entered
it
.
  
<EOS>
On
this
supposition
,
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
he
waited
until
nightfall
before
he
made
the
attempt
,
and
why
he
took
advantage
of
the
clerk
's
absence
to
possess
himself
of
the
keys
.
<EOS>
Necessity
would
oblige
him
to
strike
a
light
to
find
his
way
to
the
right
register
,
and
common
caution
would
suggest
his
locking
the
door
on
the
inside
in
case
of
intrusion
on
the
part
of
any
inquisitive
stranger
,
or
on
my
part
,
if
I
happened
to
be
in
the
neighbourhood
at
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
believe
that
it
was
any
part
of
his
intention
to
make
the
destruction
of
the
register
appear
to
be
the
result
of
accident
,
by
purposely
setting
the
vestry
on
fire
.
<EOS>
The
bare
chance
that
prompt
assistance
might
arrive
,
and
that
the
books
might
,
by
the
remotest
possibility
,
be
saved
,
would
have
been
enough
,
on
a
moment
's
consideration
,
to
dismiss
any
idea
of
this
sort
from
his
mind
.
<EOS>
Remembering
the
quantity
of
combustible
objects
in
the
vestry
 
<EOS>
the
straw
,
the
papers
,
the
packing
-
cases
,
the
dry
wood
,
the
old
worm
-
eaten
presses
 
all
the
probabilities
,
in
my
estimation
,
point
to
the
fire
as
the
result
of
an
accident
with
his
matches
or
his
light
.
  
<EOS>
His
first
impulse
,
under
these
circumstances
,
was
doubtless
to
try
to
extinguish
the
flames
,
and
failing
in
that
,
his
second
impulse
(
ignorant
as
he
was
of
the
state
of
the
lock
)
had
been
to
attempt
to
escape
by
the
door
which
had
given
him
entrance
.
<EOS>
When
I
had
called
to
him
,
the
flames
must
have
reached
across
the
door
leading
into
the
church
,
on
either
side
of
which
the
presses
extended
,
and
close
to
which
the
other
combustible
objects
were
placed
.
<EOS>
In
all
probability
,
the
smoke
and
flame
(
confined
as
they
were
to
the
room
)
had
been
too
much
for
him
when
he
tried
to
escape
by
the
inner
door
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
dropped
in
his
death
-
swoon
 
<EOS>
he
must
have
sunk
in
the
place
where
he
was
found
 
just
as
I
got
on
the
roof
to
break
the
skylight
window
.
<EOS>
Even
if
we
had
been
able
,
afterwards
,
to
get
into
the
church
,
and
to
burst
open
the
door
from
that
side
,
the
delay
must
have
been
fatal
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
been
past
saving
,
long
past
saving
,
by
that
time
.
<EOS>
We
should
only
have
given
the
flames
free
ingress
into
the
church
 
<EOS>
the
church
,
which
was
now
preserved
,
but
which
,
in
that
event
,
would
have
shared
the
fate
of
the
vestry
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
,
there
can
be
no
doubt
in
the
mind
of
any
one
,
that
he
was
a
dead
man
before
ever
we
got
to
the
empty
cottage
,
and
worked
with
might
and
main
to
tear
down
the
beam
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
the
nearest
approach
that
any
theory
of
mine
can
make
towards
accounting
for
a
result
which
was
visible
matter
of
fact
.
<EOS>
As
I
have
described
them
,
so
events
passed
to
us
outside
.
<EOS>
As
I
have
related
it
,
so
his
body
was
found
.
  
<EOS>
The
inquest
was
adjourned
over
one
day
 
no
explanation
that
the
eye
of
the
law
could
recognise
having
been
discovered
thus
far
to
account
for
the
mysterious
circumstances
of
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
arranged
that
more
witnesses
should
be
summoned
,
and
that
the
London
solicitor
of
the
deceased
should
be
invited
to
attend
.
<EOS>
A
medical
man
was
also
charged
with
the
duty
of
reporting
on
the
mental
condition
of
the
servant
,
which
appeared
at
present
to
debar
him
from
giving
any
evidence
of
the
least
importance
.
<EOS>
He
could
only
declare
,
in
a
dazed
way
,
that
he
had
been
ordered
,
on
the
night
of
the
fire
,
to
wait
in
the
lane
,
and
that
he
knew
nothing
else
,
except
that
the
deceased
was
certainly
his
master
.
  
<EOS>
My
own
impression
was
,
that
he
had
been
first
used
(
without
any
guilty
knowledge
on
his
own
part
)
to
ascertain
the
fact
of
the
clerk
's
absence
from
home
on
the
previous
day
,
and
that
he
had
been
afterwards
ordered
to
wait
near
the
church
(
but
out
of
sight
of
the
vestry
)
to
assist
his
master
,
in
the
event
of
my
escaping
the
attack
on
the
road
,
and
of
a
collision
occurring
between
Sir
Percival
and
myself
.
<EOS>
It
is
necessary
to
add
,
that
the
man
's
own
testimony
was
never
obtained
to
confirm
this
view
.
<EOS>
The
medical
report
of
him
declared
that
what
little
mental
faculty
he
possessed
was
seriously
shaken
;
nothing
satisfactory
was
extracted
from
him
at
the
adjourned
inquest
,
and
for
aught
I
know
to
the
contrary
,
he
may
never
have
recovered
to
this
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
returned
to
the
hotel
at
Welmingham
so
jaded
in
body
and
mind
,
so
weakened
and
depressed
by
all
that
I
had
gone
through
,
as
to
be
quite
unfit
to
endure
the
local
gossip
about
the
inquest
,
and
to
answer
the
trivial
questions
that
the
talkers
addressed
to
me
in
the
coffee
-
room
.
<EOS>
I
withdrew
from
my
scanty
dinner
to
my
cheap
garret
-
chamber
to
secure
myself
a
little
quiet
,
and
to
think
undisturbed
of
Laura
and
Marian
.
  
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
a
richer
man
I
would
have
gone
back
to
London
,
and
would
have
comforted
myself
with
a
sight
of
the
two
dear
faces
again
that
night
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
bound
to
appear
,
if
called
on
,
at
the
adjourned
inquest
,
and
doubly
bound
to
answer
my
bail
before
the
magistrate
at
Knowlesbury
.
<EOS>
Our
slender
resources
had
suffered
already
,
and
the
doubtful
future
 
more
doubtful
than
<EOS>
ever
now
 
made
me
dread
decreasing
our
means
unnecessarily
by
allowing
myself
an
indulgence
even
at
the
small
cost
of
a
double
railway
journey
in
the
carriages
of
the
second
class
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
 
the
day
immediately
following
the
inquest
 
was
left
at
my
own
disposal
.
<EOS>
I
began
the
morning
by
again
applying
at
the
post
-
office
for
my
regular
report
from
Marian
.
<EOS>
It
was
waiting
for
me
as
before
,
and
it
was
written
throughout
in
good
spirits
.
<EOS>
I
read
the
letter
thankfully
,
and
then
set
forth
with
my
mind
at
ease
for
the
day
to
go
to
Old
Welmingham
,
and
to
view
the
scene
of
the
fire
by
the
morning
light
.
  
<EOS>
What
changes
met
me
when
I
got
there
!
  
<EOS>
Through
all
the
ways
of
our
unintelligible
world
the
trivial
and
the
terrible
walk
hand
in
hand
together
.
<EOS>
The
irony
of
circumstances
holds
no
mortal
catastrophe
in
respect
.
<EOS>
When
I
reached
the
church
,
the
trampled
condition
of
the
burial
-
ground
was
the
only
serious
trace
left
to
tell
of
the
fire
and
the
death
.
<EOS>
A
rough
hoarding
of
boards
had
been
knocked
up
before
the
vestry
doorway
.
<EOS>
Rude
caricatures
were
scrawled
on
it
already
,
and
the
village
children
were
fighting
and
shouting
for
the
possession
of
the
best
peep
-
hole
to
see
through
.
<EOS>
On
the
spot
where
I
had
heard
the
cry
for
help
from
the
burning
room
,
on
the
spot
where
the
panic
-
stricken
servant
had
dropped
on
his
knees
,
a
fussy
flock
of
poultry
was
now
scrambling
for
the
first
choice
of
worms
after
the
rain
;
and
on
the
ground
at
my
feet
,
where
the
door
and
its
dreadful
burden
had
been
laid
,
a
workman
's
dinner
was
waiting
for
him
,
tied
up
in
a
yellow
basin
,
and
his
faithful
cur
in
charge
was
yelping
at
me
for
coming
near
the
food
.
<EOS>
The
old
clerk
,
looking
idly
at
the
slow
commencement
of
the
repairs
,
had
only
one
interest
that
he
could
talk
about
now
 
the
interest
of
escaping
all
blame
for
his
own
part
on
account
of
the
accident
that
had
happened
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
village
women
,
whose
white
wild
face
<EOS>
I
remembered
the
picture
of
terror
when
we
pulled
down
the
beam
,
was
giggling
with
another
woman
,
the
picture
of
inanity
,
over
an
old
washing
-
tub
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
serious
in
mortality
!
<EOS>
Solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
Solomon
with
the
elements
of
the
contemptible
lurking
in
every
fold
of
his
robes
and
in
every
corner
of
his
palace
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
left
the
place
,
my
thoughts
turned
,
not
for
the
first
time
,
to
the
complete
overthrow
that
all
present
hope
of
establishing
Laura
's
identity
had
now
suffered
through
Sir
Percival
's
death
.
<EOS>
He
was
gone
 
and
with
him
the
chance
was
gone
which
had
been
the
one
object
of
all
my
labours
and
all
my
hopes
.
  
<EOS>
Could
I
look
at
my
failure
from
no
truer
point
of
view
than
this
?
  
<EOS>
Suppose
he
had
lived
,
would
that
change
of
circumstance
have
altered
the
result
?
<EOS>
Could
I
have
made
my
discovery
a
marketable
commodity
,
even
for
Laura
's
sake
,
after
I
had
found
out
that
robbery
of
the
rights
of
others
was
the
essence
of
Sir
Percival
's
crime
?
<EOS>
Could
I
have
offered
the
price
of
MY
silence
for
HIS
confession
of
the
conspiracy
,
when
the
effect
of
that
silence
must
have
been
to
keep
the
right
heir
from
the
estates
,
and
the
right
owner
from
the
name
?
<EOS>
Impossible
!
<EOS>
If
Sir
Percival
had
lived
,
the
discovery
,
from
which
(
In
my
ignorance
of
the
true
nature
of
the
Secret
)
I
had
hoped
so
much
,
could
not
have
been
mine
to
suppress
or
to
make
public
,
as
I
thought
best
,
for
the
vindication
of
Laura
's
rights
.
<EOS>
In
common
honesty
and
common
honour
I
must
have
gone
at
once
to
the
stranger
whose
birthright
had
been
usurped
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
renounced
the
victory
at
the
moment
when
it
was
mine
by
placing
my
discovery
unreservedly
in
that
stranger
's
hands
 
<EOS>
and
I
must
have
faced
afresh
all
the
difficulties
which
stood
between
me
and
the
one
object
of
my
life
,
exactly
as
I
was
resolved
in
my
heart
of
hearts
to
face
them
now
!
  
<EOS>
I
returned
to
Welmingham
with
my
mind
composed
,
feeling
more
sure
of
myself
and
my
resolution
than
I
had
felt
yet
.
  
<EOS>
On
my
way
to
the
hotel
I
passed
the
end
of
the
square
in
which
Mrs.
Catherick
lived
.
<EOS>
Should
I
go
back
to
the
house
,
and
make
another
attempt
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
That
news
of
Sir
Percival
's
death
,
which
was
the
last
news
she
ever
expected
to
hear
,
must
have
reached
her
hours
since
.
<EOS>
All
the
proceedings
at
the
inquest
had
been
reported
in
the
local
paper
<EOS>
that
morning
 
there
was
nothing
I
could
tell
her
which
she
did
not
know
already
.
<EOS>
My
interest
in
making
her
speak
had
slackened
.
<EOS>
I
remembered
the
furtive
hatred
in
her
face
when
she
said
,
"
There
is
no
news
of
Sir
Percival
that
I
do
n't
expect
 
except
the
news
of
his
death
.
<EOS>
"
I
remembered
the
stealthy
interest
in
her
eyes
when
they
settled
on
me
at
parting
,
after
she
had
spoken
those
words
.
<EOS>
Some
instinct
,
deep
in
my
heart
,
which
I
felt
to
be
a
true
one
,
made
the
prospect
of
again
entering
her
presence
repulsive
to
me
 
<EOS>
I
turned
away
from
the
square
,
and
went
straight
back
to
the
hotel
.
  
<EOS>
Some
hours
later
,
while
I
was
resting
in
the
coffee
-
room
,
a
letter
was
placed
in
my
hands
by
the
waiter
.
<EOS>
It
was
addressed
to
me
by
name
,
and
I
found
on
inquiry
that
it
had
been
left
at
the
bar
by
a
woman
just
as
it
was
near
dusk
,
and
just
before
the
gas
was
lighted
.
<EOS>
She
had
said
nothing
,
and
she
had
gone
away
again
before
there
was
time
to
speak
to
her
,
or
even
to
notice
who
she
was
.
  
<EOS>
I
opened
the
letter
.
<EOS>
It
was
neither
dated
nor
signed
,
and
the
handwriting
was
palpably
disguised
.
<EOS>
Before
I
had
read
the
first
sentence
,
however
,
I
knew
who
my
correspondent
was
 
Mrs.
Catherick
.
  
<EOS>
The
letter
ran
as
follows
 
<EOS>
I
copy
it
exactly
,
word
for
word
:
    
<EOS>
THE
STORY
CONTINUED
BY
MRS
.
<EOS>
CATHERICK
  
<EOS>
SIR
,
 
<EOS>
You
have
not
come
back
,
as
you
said
you
would
.
<EOS>
No
matter
 
I
know
the
news
,
and
I
write
to
tell
you
so
.
<EOS>
Did
you
see
anything
particular
in
my
face
when
you
left
me
?
<EOS>
I
was
wondering
,
in
my
own
mind
,
whether
the
day
of
his
downfall
had
come
at
last
,
and
whether
you
were
the
chosen
instrument
for
working
it
.
<EOS>
You
were
,
and
you
HAVE
worked
it
.
  
<EOS>
You
were
weak
enough
,
as
I
have
heard
,
to
try
and
save
his
life
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
succeeded
,
I
should
have
looked
upon
you
as
my
enemy
.
<EOS>
Now
you
have
failed
,
I
hold
you
as
my
friend
.
<EOS>
Your
inquiries
frightened
him
into
the
vestry
by
night
 
your
inquiries
,
without
your
privity
and
against
your
will
,
have
served
the
hatred
and
wreaked
the
vengeance
of
three
-
and
-
twenty
years
.
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
sir
,
in
spite
of
yourself
.
  
<EOS>
I
owe
something
to
the
man
who
has
done
this
.
<EOS>
How
can
I
pay
my
debt
?
<EOS>
If
I
was
a
young
woman
still
I
might
say
,
"
Come
,
put
your
arm
round
my
waist
,
and
kiss
me
,
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
been
fond
enough
of
you
even
to
go
that
length
,
and
you
would
have
accepted
my
invitation
 
<EOS>
you
would
,
sir
,
twenty
years
ago
!
<EOS>
But
I
am
an
old
woman
now
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
can
satisfy
your
curiosity
,
and
pay
my
debt
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
You
HAD
a
great
curiosity
to
know
certain
private
affairs
of
mine
when
you
came
to
see
me
 
private
affairs
which
all
your
sharpness
could
not
look
into
without
my
help
 
private
affairs
which
you
have
not
discovered
,
even
now
.
<EOS>
You
SHALL
discover
them
 
your
curiosity
shall
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
any
trouble
to
please
you
,
my
estimable
young
friend
!
  
<EOS>
You
were
a
little
boy
,
I
suppose
,
in
the
year
twenty
-
seven
?
<EOS>
I
was
a
handsome
young
woman
at
that
time
,
living
at
Old
Welmingham
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
contemptible
fool
for
a
husband
.
<EOS>
I
had
also
the
honour
of
being
acquainted
(
never
mind
how
)
with
a
certain
gentleman
(
never
mind
whom
)
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
call
him
by
his
name
.
<EOS>
Why
should
I
?
<EOS>
It
was
not
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
never
had
a
name
:
you
know
<EOS>
that
,
by
this
time
,
as
well
as
I
do
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
be
more
to
the
purpose
to
tell
you
how
he
worked
himself
into
my
good
graces
.
<EOS>
I
was
born
with
the
tastes
of
a
lady
,
and
he
gratified
them
 
in
other
words
,
he
admired
me
,
and
he
made
me
presents
.
<EOS>
No
woman
can
resist
admiration
and
presents
 
especially
presents
,
provided
they
happen
to
be
just
the
thing
she
wants
.
<EOS>
He
was
sharp
enough
to
know
that
 
most
men
are
.
<EOS>
Naturally
he
wanted
something
in
return
 
all
men
do
.
<EOS>
And
what
do
you
think
was
the
something
?
<EOS>
The
merest
trifle
.
<EOS>
Nothing
but
the
key
of
the
vestry
,
and
the
key
of
the
press
inside
it
,
when
my
husband
's
back
was
turned
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
lied
when
I
asked
him
why
he
wished
me
to
get
him
the
keys
in
that
private
way
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
saved
himself
the
trouble
 
I
did
n't
believe
him
.
<EOS>
But
I
liked
my
presents
,
and
I
wanted
more
.
<EOS>
So
I
got
him
the
keys
,
without
my
husband
's
knowledge
,
and
I
watched
him
,
without
his
own
knowledge
.
<EOS>
Once
,
twice
,
four
times
I
watched
him
,
and
the
fourth
time
I
found
him
out
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
never
over
-
scrupulous
where
other
people
's
affairs
were
concerned
,
and
I
was
not
over
-
scrupulous
about
his
adding
one
to
the
marriages
in
the
register
on
his
own
account
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
I
knew
it
was
wrong
,
but
it
did
no
harm
to
me
,
which
was
one
good
reason
for
not
making
a
fuss
about
it
.
<EOS>
And
I
had
not
got
a
gold
watch
and
chain
,
which
was
another
,
<EOS>
still
better
 
<EOS>
and
he
had
promised
me
one
from
London
<EOS>
only
the
day
before
,
which
was
a
third
,
best
of
all
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
known
what
the
law
considered
the
crime
to
be
,
and
how
the
law
punished
it
,
I
should
have
taken
proper
care
of
myself
,
and
have
exposed
him
then
and
there
.
<EOS>
But
I
knew
nothing
,
and
I
longed
for
the
gold
watch
.
<EOS>
All
the
conditions
I
insisted
on
were
that
he
should
take
me
into
his
confidence
and
tell
me
everything
.
<EOS>
I
was
as
curious
about
his
affairs
then
as
you
are
about
mine
now
.
<EOS>
He
granted
my
conditions
 
why
,
you
will
see
presently
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
put
in
short
,
is
what
I
heard
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
willingly
tell
me
all
that
I
tell
you
here
.
<EOS>
I
drew
some
of
it
from
him
by
persuasion
and
some
of
it
by
questions
.
<EOS>
I
was
determined
to
have
all
the
truth
,
and
I
believe
I
got
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
knew
no
more
than
any
one
else
of
what
the
state
of
things
really
was
between
his
father
and
mother
till
after
his
mother
's
death
.
<EOS>
Then
his
father
confessed
it
,
and
promised
to
do
what
he
could
for
his
son
.
<EOS>
He
died
having
done
nothing
 
not
having
even
made
a
will
.
<EOS>
The
son
(
who
can
blame
him
?
)
<EOS>
wisely
provided
for
himself
.
<EOS>
He
came
to
England
at
once
,
and
took
possession
of
the
property
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
one
to
suspect
him
,
and
no
one
to
say
him
nay
.
<EOS>
His
father
and
mother
had
always
lived
as
man
and
wife
 
none
of
the
few
people
who
were
acquainted
with
them
ever
supposed
them
to
be
anything
else
.
<EOS>
The
right
person
to
claim
the
property
(
if
the
truth
had
been
known
)
was
a
distant
relation
,
who
had
no
idea
of
ever
getting
it
,
and
who
was
away
at
sea
when
his
father
died
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
difficulty
so
far
 
he
took
possession
,
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
borrow
money
on
the
property
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
things
wanted
of
him
before
he
could
do
this
.
<EOS>
One
was
a
certificate
of
his
birth
,
and
the
other
was
a
certificate
of
his
parents
'
marriage
.
<EOS>
The
certificate
of
his
birth
was
easily
got
 
he
was
born
abroad
,
and
the
certificate
was
there
in
due
form
.
<EOS>
The
other
matter
was
a
difficulty
,
and
that
difficulty
brought
him
to
Old
Welmingham
.
  
<EOS>
But
for
one
consideration
he
might
have
gone
to
Knowlesbury
instead
.
  
<EOS>
His
mother
had
been
living
there
just
before
she
met
with
his
father
 
living
under
her
maiden
name
,
the
truth
being
that
she
was
really
a
married
woman
,
married
in
Ireland
,
<EOS>
where
her
husband
had
ill
-
used
her
,
and
had
afterwards
gone
off
with
some
other
person
.
<EOS>
I
give
you
this
fact
on
good
authority
 
<EOS>
Sir
Felix
mentioned
it
to
his
son
as
the
reason
why
he
had
not
married
.
<EOS>
You
may
wonder
why
the
son
,
knowing
that
his
parents
had
met
each
other
at
Knowlesbury
,
did
not
play
his
first
tricks
with
the
register
of
that
church
,
where
it
might
have
been
fairly
presumed
his
father
and
mother
were
married
.
<EOS>
The
reason
was
that
the
clergyman
who
did
duty
at
Knowlesbury
church
,
in
the
year
eighteen
hundred
and
three
(
when
,
according
to
his
birth
certificate
,
his
father
and
mother
OUGHT
to
have
been
married
)
,
was
alive
still
when
he
took
possession
of
the
property
in
the
New
Year
of
eighteen
hundred
and
twenty
-
seven
.
<EOS>
This
awkward
circumstance
forced
him
to
extend
his
inquiries
to
our
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
There
no
such
danger
existed
,
the
former
clergyman
at
our
church
having
been
dead
for
some
years
.
  
<EOS>
Old
Welmingham
suited
his
purpose
as
well
as
Knowlesbury
.
<EOS>
His
father
had
removed
his
mother
from
Knowlesbury
,
and
had
lived
with
her
at
a
cottage
on
the
river
,
a
little
distance
from
our
village
.
<EOS>
People
who
had
known
his
solitary
ways
when
he
was
single
did
not
wonder
at
his
solitary
ways
when
he
was
supposed
to
be
married
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
not
been
a
hideous
creature
to
look
at
,
his
retired
life
with
the
lady
might
have
raised
suspicions
;
but
,
as
things
were
,
his
hiding
his
ugliness
and
his
deformity
in
the
strictest
privacy
surprised
nobody
.
<EOS>
He
lived
in
our
neighbourhood
till
he
came
in
possession
of
the
Park
.
<EOS>
After
three
or
four
and
twenty
years
had
passed
,
who
was
to
say
(
the
clergyman
being
dead
)
that
his
marriage
had
not
been
as
private
as
the
rest
of
his
life
,
and
that
it
had
not
taken
place
at
Old
Welmingham
church
?
  
<EOS>
So
,
as
I
told
you
,
the
son
found
our
neighbourhood
the
surest
place
he
could
choose
to
set
things
right
secretly
in
his
own
interests
.
<EOS>
It
may
surprise
you
to
hear
that
what
he
really
did
to
the
marriage
register
was
done
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
 
done
on
second
thoughts
.
  
<EOS>
His
first
notion
was
only
to
tear
the
leaf
out
(
in
the
right
year
and
month
)
,
to
destroy
it
privately
,
to
go
back
to
London
,
and
to
tell
the
lawyers
to
get
him
the
necessary
certificate
of
his
father
's
marriage
,
innocently
referring
them
of
course
to
the
date
on
the
leaf
that
was
gone
.
<EOS>
Nobody
could
say
his
father
and
mother
had
NOT
been
married
after
that
,
and
whether
,
under
the
circumstances
,
they
would
stretch
a
point
or
not
about
lending
him
the
money
<EOS>
(
he
thought
they
would
)
,
he
had
his
answer
ready
at
all
events
,
if
a
question
was
ever
raised
about
his
right
to
the
name
and
the
estate
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
he
came
to
look
privately
at
the
register
for
himself
,
he
found
at
the
bottom
of
one
of
the
pages
for
the
year
eighteen
hundred
and
three
a
blank
space
left
,
seemingly
through
there
being
no
room
to
make
a
long
entry
there
,
which
was
made
instead
at
the
top
of
the
next
page
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
this
chance
altered
all
his
plans
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
opportunity
he
had
never
hoped
for
,
or
thought
of
 
<EOS>
and
he
took
it
 
<EOS>
you
know
how
.
<EOS>
The
blank
space
,
to
have
exactly
tallied
with
his
birth
certificate
,
ought
to
have
occurred
in
the
July
part
of
the
register
.
<EOS>
It
occurred
in
the
September
part
instead
.
<EOS>
However
,
in
this
case
,
if
suspicious
questions
were
asked
,
the
answer
was
not
hard
to
find
.
<EOS>
He
had
only
to
describe
himself
as
a
seven
months
'
child
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
fool
enough
,
when
he
told
me
his
story
,
to
feel
some
interest
and
some
pity
for
him
 
which
was
just
what
he
calculated
on
,
as
you
will
see
.
<EOS>
I
thought
him
hardly
used
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
his
fault
that
his
father
and
mother
were
not
married
,
and
it
was
not
his
father
's
and
mother
's
fault
either
.
<EOS>
A
more
scrupulous
woman
than
I
was
 
a
woman
who
had
not
set
her
heart
on
a
gold
watch
and
chain
 
would
have
found
some
excuses
for
him
.
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
I
held
my
tongue
,
and
helped
to
screen
what
he
was
about
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
some
time
getting
the
ink
the
right
colour
<EOS>
(
mixing
it
over
and
over
again
in
pots
and
bottles
of
mine
)
,
and
some
time
afterwards
in
practising
the
handwriting
.
<EOS>
But
he
succeeded
in
the
end
,
and
made
an
honest
woman
of
his
mother
after
she
was
dead
in
her
grave
!
<EOS>
So
far
,
I
do
n't
deny
that
he
behaved
honourably
enough
to
myself
.
<EOS>
He
gave
me
my
watch
and
chain
,
and
spared
no
expense
in
buying
them
;
both
were
of
superior
workmanship
,
and
very
expensive
.
<EOS>
I
have
got
them
still
 
<EOS>
the
watch
goes
beautifully
.
  
<EOS>
You
said
the
other
day
that
Mrs.
Clements
had
told
you
everything
she
knew
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
write
about
the
trumpery
scandal
by
which
I
was
the
sufferer
 
<EOS>
the
innocent
sufferer
,
I
positively
assert
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
as
well
as
I
do
what
the
notion
was
which
my
husband
took
into
his
head
when
he
found
me
and
my
fine
-
gentleman
acquaintance
meeting
each
other
privately
and
talking
secrets
together
.
<EOS>
But
what
you
do
n't
know
is
how
it
ended
between
that
same
gentleman
and
myself
.
<EOS>
You
shall
read
and
see
how
he
behaved
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
words
I
said
to
him
,
when
I
saw
the
turn
things
had
taken
,
were
,
"
Do
me
justice
 
<EOS>
clear
my
character
of
a
stain
on
it
which
you
know
I
do
n't
deserve
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
you
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
to
my
husband
 
<EOS>
only
tell
him
,
on
your
word
of
honour
as
a
gentleman
,
that
he
is
wrong
,
and
that
I
am
not
to
blame
in
the
way
he
thinks
I
am
.
<EOS>
Do
me
that
justice
,
at
least
,
after
all
I
have
done
for
you
.
"
<EOS>
He
flatly
refused
,
in
so
many
words
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
plainly
that
it
was
his
interest
to
let
my
husband
and
all
my
neighbours
believe
the
falsehood
 
because
,
as
long
as
they
did
so
they
were
quite
certain
never
to
suspect
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
spirit
of
my
own
,
and
I
told
him
they
should
know
the
truth
from
my
lips
.
<EOS>
His
reply
was
short
,
and
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
If
I
spoke
,
I
was
a
lost
woman
,
as
certainly
as
he
was
a
lost
man
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
it
had
come
to
that
.
<EOS>
He
had
deceived
me
about
the
risk
I
ran
in
helping
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
practised
on
my
ignorance
,
he
had
tempted
me
with
his
gifts
,
he
had
interested
me
with
his
story
 
and
the
result
of
it
<EOS>
was
that
he
made
me
his
accomplice
.
<EOS>
He
owned
this
coolly
,
and
he
ended
by
telling
me
,
for
the
first
time
,
what
the
frightful
punishment
really
was
for
his
offence
,
and
for
any
one
who
helped
him
to
commit
it
.
<EOS>
In
those
days
the
law
was
not
so
tender
-
hearted
as
I
hear
it
is
now
.
<EOS>
Murderers
were
not
the
only
people
liable
to
be
hanged
,
and
women
convicts
were
not
treated
like
ladies
in
undeserved
distress
.
<EOS>
I
confess
he
frightened
me
 
the
mean
impostor
!
<EOS>
the
cowardly
blackguard
!
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
now
how
I
hated
him
?
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
why
I
am
taking
all
this
trouble
 
thankfully
taking
it
 
to
gratify
the
curiosity
of
the
meritorious
young
gentleman
who
hunted
him
down
?
  
<EOS>
Well
,
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
He
was
hardly
fool
enough
to
drive
me
to
downright
desperation
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
the
sort
of
woman
whom
it
was
quite
safe
to
hunt
into
a
corner
 
he
knew
that
,
and
wisely
quieted
me
with
proposals
for
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
I
deserved
some
reward
<EOS>
(
he
was
kind
enough
to
say
)
for
the
service
I
had
done
him
,
and
some
compensation
(
he
was
so
obliging
as
to
add
)
<EOS>
for
what
I
had
suffered
.
<EOS>
He
was
quite
willing
 
generous
scoundrel
!
 
<EOS>
to
make
me
a
handsome
yearly
allowance
,
payable
quarterly
,
on
two
conditions
.
<EOS>
First
,
I
was
to
hold
my
tongue
 
in
my
own
interests
as
well
as
in
his
.
<EOS>
Secondly
,
I
was
not
to
stir
away
from
Welmingham
without
first
letting
him
know
,
and
waiting
till
I
had
obtained
his
permission
.
<EOS>
In
my
own
neighbourhood
,
no
virtuous
female
friends
would
tempt
me
into
dangerous
gossiping
at
the
tea
-
table
.
<EOS>
In
my
own
neighbourhood
,
he
would
always
know
where
to
find
me
.
<EOS>
A
hard
condition
,
that
second
one
 
<EOS>
but
I
accepted
it
.
  
<EOS>
What
else
was
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
I
was
left
helpless
,
with
the
prospect
of
a
coming
incumbrance
in
the
shape
of
a
child
.
<EOS>
What
else
was
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
Cast
myself
on
the
mercy
of
my
runaway
idiot
of
a
husband
who
had
raised
the
scandal
against
me
?
<EOS>
I
would
have
died
first
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
allowance
WAS
a
handsome
one
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
better
income
,
a
better
house
over
my
head
,
better
carpets
on
my
floors
,
than
half
the
women
who
turned
up
the
whites
of
their
eyes
at
the
sight
of
me
.
<EOS>
The
dress
of
Virtue
,
in
our
parts
,
was
cotton
print
.
<EOS>
I
had
silk
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
accepted
the
conditions
he
offered
me
,
and
made
the
best
of
them
,
and
fought
my
battle
with
my
respectable
neighbours
on
their
own
ground
,
and
won
it
in
course
of
time
 
as
you
saw
yourself
.
<EOS>
How
I
kept
his
Secret
(
and
mine
)
through
all
the
years
that
have
passed
from
that
time
to
this
,
and
whether
my
late
daughter
,
Anne
,
ever
really
crept
into
my
confidence
,
and
got
the
keeping
of
the
Secret
too
 
are
questions
,
I
dare
say
,
to
which
you
are
curious
to
find
an
answer
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
my
gratitude
refuses
you
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
will
turn
to
a
fresh
page
and
give
you
the
answer
immediately
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
excuse
one
thing
 
<EOS>
you
must
excuse
my
beginning
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
with
an
expression
of
surprise
at
the
interest
which
you
appear
to
have
felt
in
my
late
daughter
.
<EOS>
It
is
quite
unaccountable
to
me
.
<EOS>
If
that
interest
makes
you
anxious
for
any
particulars
of
her
early
life
,
I
must
refer
you
to
Mrs.
Clements
,
who
knows
more
of
the
subject
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
Pray
understand
that
I
do
not
profess
to
have
been
at
all
overfond
of
my
late
daughter
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
worry
to
me
from
first
to
last
,
with
the
additional
disadvantage
of
being
always
weak
in
the
head
.
<EOS>
You
like
candour
,
and
I
hope
this
satisfies
you
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
no
need
to
trouble
you
with
many
personal
particulars
relating
to
those
past
times
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
enough
to
say
that
I
observed
the
terms
of
the
bargain
on
my
side
,
and
that
I
enjoyed
my
comfortable
income
in
return
,
paid
quarterly
.
  
<EOS>
Now
<EOS>
and
then
I
got
away
and
changed
the
scene
for
a
short
time
,
always
asking
leave
of
my
lord
and
master
first
,
and
generally
getting
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
,
as
I
have
already
told
you
,
fool
enough
to
drive
me
too
hard
,
and
he
could
reasonably
rely
on
my
holding
my
tongue
for
my
own
sake
,
if
not
for
his
.
<EOS>
One
of
my
longest
trips
away
from
home
was
the
trip
I
took
to
Limmeridge
to
nurse
a
half
-
sister
there
,
who
was
dying
.
<EOS>
She
was
reported
to
have
saved
money
,
and
I
thought
it
as
well
(
in
case
any
accident
happened
to
stop
my
allowance
)
to
look
after
my
own
interests
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
As
things
turned
out
,
however
,
my
pains
were
all
thrown
away
,
and
I
got
nothing
,
because
nothing
was
to
be
had
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
taken
Anne
to
the
north
with
me
,
having
my
whims
and
fancies
,
occasionally
,
about
my
child
,
and
getting
,
at
such
times
,
jealous
of
Mrs.
Clements
'
influence
over
her
.
<EOS>
I
never
liked
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
poor
,
empty
-
headed
,
spiritless
woman
 
what
you
call
a
born
drudge
 
<EOS>
and
I
was
now
and
then
not
averse
to
plaguing
her
by
taking
Anne
away
.
<EOS>
Not
knowing
what
else
to
do
with
my
girl
while
I
was
nursing
in
Cumberland
,
I
put
her
to
school
at
Limmeridge
.
<EOS>
The
lady
of
the
manor
,
Mrs.
Fairlie
(
a
remarkably
plain
-
looking
woman
,
who
had
entrapped
one
of
the
handsomest
men
in
England
into
marrying
her
)
,
amused
me
wonderfully
by
taking
a
violent
fancy
to
my
girl
.
<EOS>
The
consequence
was
,
she
learnt
nothing
at
school
,
and
was
petted
and
spoilt
at
Limmeridge
House
.
<EOS>
Among
other
whims
and
fancies
which
they
taught
her
there
,
they
put
some
nonsense
into
her
head
about
always
wearing
white
.
<EOS>
Hating
white
and
liking
colours
myself
,
I
determined
to
take
the
nonsense
out
of
her
head
as
soon
as
we
got
home
again
.
  
<EOS>
Strange
to
say
,
my
daughter
resolutely
resisted
me
.
<EOS>
When
she
HAD
got
a
notion
once
fixed
in
her
mind
<EOS>
she
was
,
like
other
half
-
witted
people
,
as
obstinate
as
a
mule
in
keeping
it
.
<EOS>
We
quarrelled
finely
,
and
Mrs.
Clements
,
not
liking
to
see
it
,
I
suppose
,
offered
to
take
Anne
away
to
live
in
London
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
said
<EOS>
Yes
,
if
Mrs.
Clements
had
not
sided
with
my
daughter
about
her
dressing
herself
in
white
.
<EOS>
But
being
determined
she
should
NOT
dress
herself
in
white
,
and
disliking
Mrs.
Clements
more
than
ever
for
taking
part
against
me
,
I
said
No
,
and
meant
No
,
and
stuck
to
No
.
<EOS>
The
consequence
was
,
my
daughter
remained
with
me
,
and
the
consequence
of
that
,
in
its
turn
,
was
the
first
serious
quarrel
that
happened
about
the
Secret
.
  
<EOS>
The
circumstance
took
place
long
after
the
time
I
have
just
been
writing
of
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
settled
for
years
in
the
new
town
,
and
was
steadily
living
down
my
bad
character
and
slowly
gaining
ground
among
the
respectable
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
It
helped
me
forward
greatly
towards
this
object
to
have
my
daughter
with
me
.
<EOS>
Her
harmlessness
and
her
fancy
for
dressing
in
white
excited
a
certain
amount
of
sympathy
.
<EOS>
I
left
off
opposing
her
favourite
whim
on
that
account
,
because
some
of
the
sympathy
was
sure
,
in
course
of
time
,
to
fall
to
my
share
.
<EOS>
Some
of
it
did
fall
.
<EOS>
I
date
my
getting
a
choice
of
the
two
best
sittings
to
let
in
the
church
from
that
time
,
and
I
date
the
clergyman
's
first
bow
from
my
getting
the
sittings
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
being
settled
in
this
way
,
I
received
a
letter
one
morning
from
that
highly
born
gentleman
(
now
deceased
)
in
answer
to
one
of
mine
,
warning
him
,
according
to
agreement
,
of
my
wishing
to
leave
the
town
for
a
little
change
of
air
and
scene
.
  
<EOS>
The
ruffianly
side
of
him
must
have
been
uppermost
,
I
suppose
,
when
he
got
my
letter
,
for
he
wrote
back
,
refusing
me
in
such
abominably
insolent
language
,
that
I
lost
all
command
over
myself
,
and
abused
him
,
in
my
daughter
's
presence
,
as
"
a
low
impostor
whom
I
could
ruin
for
life
if
I
chose
to
open
my
lips
and
let
out
his
Secret
.
<EOS>
"
I
said
no
more
about
him
than
that
,
being
brought
to
my
senses
as
soon
as
those
words
had
escaped
me
by
the
sight
of
my
daughter
's
face
looking
eagerly
and
curiously
at
mine
.
<EOS>
I
instantly
ordered
her
out
of
the
room
until
I
had
composed
myself
again
.
  
<EOS>
My
sensations
were
not
pleasant
,
I
can
tell
you
,
when
I
came
to
reflect
on
my
own
folly
.
<EOS>
Anne
had
been
more
than
usually
crazy
and
queer
that
year
,
and
when
I
thought
of
the
chance
there
might
be
of
her
repeating
my
words
in
the
town
,
and
mentioning
HIS
name
in
connection
with
them
,
if
inquisitive
people
got
hold
of
her
,
I
was
finely
terrified
at
the
possible
consequences
.
<EOS>
My
worst
fears
for
myself
,
my
worst
dread
of
what
he
might
do
,
led
me
no
farther
than
this
.
<EOS>
I
was
quite
unprepared
for
what
really
did
happen
only
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
On
that
next
day
,
without
any
warning
to
me
to
expect
him
,
he
came
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
His
first
words
,
and
the
tone
in
which
he
spoke
them
,
surly
as
it
was
,
showed
me
plainly
enough
that
he
had
repented
already
of
his
insolent
answer
to
my
application
,
and
that
he
had
come
in
a
mighty
bad
temper
to
try
and
set
matters
right
again
before
it
was
too
late
.
<EOS>
Seeing
my
daughter
in
the
room
with
me
(
I
had
been
afraid
to
let
her
out
of
my
sight
after
what
had
happened
the
day
before
)
<EOS>
he
ordered
her
away
.
<EOS>
They
neither
of
them
liked
each
other
,
and
he
vented
the
ill
-
temper
on
HER
which
he
was
afraid
to
show
to
ME
.
  
<EOS>
"
Leave
us
,
"
he
said
,
looking
at
her
over
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
She
looked
back
over
HER
shoulder
and
waited
as
if
she
did
n't
care
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
?
"
<EOS>
he
roared
out
,
"
leave
the
room
.
"
<EOS>
"
Speak
to
me
civilly
,
"
says
she
,
getting
red
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
"
Turn
the
idiot
out
,
"
says
he
,
looking
my
way
.
<EOS>
She
had
always
had
crazy
notions
of
her
own
about
her
dignity
,
and
that
word
"
idiot
"
upset
her
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Before
I
could
interfere
she
stepped
up
to
him
in
a
fine
passion
.
<EOS>
"
Beg
my
pardon
,
directly
,
"
says
she
,
"
or
I
'll
make
it
the
worse
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
'll
let
out
your
Secret
.
<EOS>
I
can
ruin
you
for
life
if
I
choose
to
open
my
lips
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
own
words
!
 
<EOS>
repeated
exactly
from
what
I
had
said
the
day
before
 
repeated
,
in
his
presence
,
as
if
they
had
come
from
herself
.
<EOS>
He
sat
speechless
,
as
white
as
the
paper
I
am
writing
on
,
while
I
pushed
her
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
When
he
recovered
himself
    
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
I
am
too
respectable
a
woman
to
mention
what
he
said
when
he
recovered
himself
.
<EOS>
My
pen
is
the
pen
of
a
member
of
the
rector
's
congregation
,
and
a
subscriber
to
the
"
Wednesday
Lectures
on
Justification
by
Faith
"
 
<EOS>
how
can
you
expect
me
to
employ
it
in
writing
bad
language
?
<EOS>
Suppose
,
for
yourself
,
the
raging
,
swearing
frenzy
of
the
lowest
ruffian
in
England
,
and
let
us
get
on
together
,
as
fast
as
may
be
,
to
the
way
in
which
it
all
ended
.
  
<EOS>
It
ended
,
as
you
probably
guess
by
this
time
,
in
his
insisting
on
securing
his
own
safety
by
shutting
her
up
.
  
<EOS>
I
tried
to
set
things
right
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
that
she
had
merely
repeated
,
like
a
parrot
,
the
words
she
had
heard
me
say
and
that
she
knew
no
particulars
whatever
,
because
I
had
mentioned
none
.
<EOS>
I
explained
that
she
had
affected
,
out
of
crazy
spite
against
him
,
to
know
what
she
really
did
NOT
know
 
that
she
only
wanted
to
threaten
him
and
aggravate
him
for
speaking
to
her
as
he
had
just
spoken
 
and
that
my
unlucky
words
gave
her
just
the
chance
of
doing
mischief
of
which
she
was
in
search
.
<EOS>
I
referred
him
to
other
queer
ways
of
hers
,
and
to
his
own
experience
of
the
vagaries
of
half
-
witted
people
 
<EOS>
it
was
all
to
no
purpose
 
<EOS>
he
would
not
believe
me
on
my
oath
 
<EOS>
he
was
absolutely
certain
I
had
betrayed
the
whole
Secret
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
would
hear
of
nothing
but
shutting
her
up
.
  
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
,
I
did
my
duty
as
a
mother
.
"
<EOS>
No
pauper
Asylum
,
"
I
said
,
"
I
wo
n't
have
her
put
in
a
pauper
Asylum
.
<EOS>
A
Private
Establishment
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
I
have
my
feelings
as
a
mother
,
and
my
character
to
preserve
in
the
town
,
and
I
will
submit
to
nothing
but
a
Private
Establishment
,
of
the
sort
which
my
genteel
neighbours
would
choose
for
afflicted
relatives
of
their
own
.
<EOS>
"
Those
were
my
words
.
<EOS>
It
is
gratifying
to
me
to
reflect
that
I
did
my
duty
.
<EOS>
Though
never
overfond
of
my
late
daughter
,
I
had
a
proper
pride
about
her
.
<EOS>
No
pauper
stain
 
<EOS>
thanks
to
my
firmness
and
resolution
 
ever
rested
on
MY
child
.
  
<EOS>
Having
carried
my
point
(
which
I
did
the
more
easily
,
in
consequence
of
the
facilities
offered
by
private
Asylums
)
,
I
could
not
refuse
to
admit
that
there
were
certain
advantages
gained
by
shutting
her
up
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
she
was
taken
excellent
care
of
 
being
treated
(
as
I
took
care
to
mention
in
the
town
)
on
the
footing
of
a
lady
.
<EOS>
In
the
second
place
,
she
was
kept
away
from
Welmingham
,
where
she
might
have
set
people
suspecting
and
inquiring
,
by
repeating
my
own
incautious
words
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
drawback
of
putting
her
under
restraint
was
a
very
slight
one
.
<EOS>
We
merely
turned
her
empty
boast
about
knowing
the
Secret
into
a
fixed
delusion
.
<EOS>
Having
first
spoken
in
sheer
crazy
spitefulness
against
the
man
who
had
offended
her
,
she
was
cunning
enough
to
see
that
she
had
seriously
frightened
him
,
and
sharp
enough
afterwards
to
discover
that
HE
was
concerned
in
shutting
her
up
.
<EOS>
The
consequence
was
she
flamed
out
into
a
perfect
frenzy
of
passion
against
him
,
going
to
the
Asylum
,
and
the
first
words
she
said
to
the
nurses
,
after
they
had
quieted
her
,
were
,
that
she
was
put
in
confinement
for
knowing
his
Secret
,
and
that
she
meant
to
open
her
lips
and
ruin
him
,
when
the
right
time
came
.
  
<EOS>
She
may
have
said
the
same
thing
to
you
,
when
you
thoughtlessly
assisted
her
escape
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
said
it
(
as
I
heard
last
summer
)
to
the
unfortunate
woman
who
married
our
sweet
-
tempered
,
nameless
gentleman
lately
deceased
.
<EOS>
If
either
you
,
or
that
unlucky
lady
,
had
questioned
my
daughter
closely
,
and
had
insisted
on
her
explaining
what
she
really
meant
,
you
would
have
found
her
lose
all
her
self
-
importance
suddenly
,
and
get
vacant
,
and
restless
,
and
confused
 
you
would
have
discovered
that
I
am
writing
nothing
here
but
the
plain
truth
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
there
was
a
Secret
 
<EOS>
she
knew
who
was
connected
with
it
 
<EOS>
she
knew
who
would
suffer
by
its
being
known
 
and
beyond
that
<EOS>
,
whatever
airs
of
importance
she
may
have
given
herself
,
<EOS>
whatever
crazy
boasting
she
may
have
indulged
in
with
strangers
,
she
never
to
her
dying
day
knew
more
.
  
<EOS>
Have
I
satisfied
your
curiosity
?
<EOS>
I
have
taken
pains
enough
to
satisfy
it
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
There
is
really
nothing
else
I
have
to
tell
you
about
myself
or
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
My
worst
responsibilities
,
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
,
were
all
over
when
she
was
secured
in
the
Asylum
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
form
of
letter
relating
to
the
circumstances
under
which
she
was
shut
up
,
given
me
to
write
,
in
answer
to
one
Miss
Halcombe
,
who
was
curious
in
the
matter
,
and
who
must
have
heard
plenty
of
lies
about
me
from
a
certain
tongue
well
accustomed
to
the
telling
of
the
same
.
<EOS>
And
I
did
what
I
could
afterwards
to
trace
my
runaway
daughter
,
and
prevent
her
from
doing
mischief
by
making
inquiries
myself
in
the
neighbourhood
where
she
was
falsely
reported
to
have
been
seen
.
<EOS>
But
these
,
and
other
trifles
like
them
,
are
of
little
or
no
interest
to
you
after
what
you
have
heard
already
.
  
<EOS>
So
far
,
I
have
written
in
the
friendliest
possible
spirit
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
close
this
letter
without
adding
a
word
here
of
serious
remonstrance
and
reproof
,
addressed
to
yourself
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
your
personal
interview
with
me
,
you
audaciously
referred
to
my
late
daughter
's
parentage
on
the
father
's
side
,
as
if
that
parentage
was
a
matter
of
doubt
.
<EOS>
This
was
highly
improper
and
very
ungentlemanlike
on
your
part
!
<EOS>
If
we
see
each
other
again
,
remember
,
if
you
please
,
that
I
will
allow
no
liberties
to
be
taken
with
my
reputation
,
and
that
the
moral
atmosphere
of
Welmingham
(
to
use
a
favourite
expression
of
my
friend
the
rector
's
)
must
not
be
tainted
by
loose
conversation
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
If
you
allow
yourself
to
doubt
that
my
husband
was
Anne
's
father
,
you
personally
insult
me
in
the
grossest
manner
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
felt
,
and
if
you
still
continue
to
feel
,
an
unhallowed
curiosity
on
this
subject
,
I
recommend
you
,
in
your
own
interests
,
to
check
it
at
once
,
and
for
ever
.
<EOS>
On
this
side
of
the
grave
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
whatever
may
happen
on
the
other
,
THAT
curiosity
will
never
be
gratified
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
after
what
I
have
just
said
,
you
will
see
the
necessity
of
writing
me
an
apology
.
<EOS>
Do
so
,
and
I
will
willingly
receive
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
,
afterwards
,
if
your
wishes
point
to
a
second
interview
with
me
,
go
a
step
farther
,
and
receive
you
.
<EOS>
My
circumstances
only
enable
me
to
invite
you
to
tea
 
not
that
they
are
at
all
altered
for
the
worse
by
what
has
happened
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
lived
,
as
I
think
I
told
you
,
well
within
my
income
,
and
I
have
saved
enough
,
in
the
last
twenty
years
,
to
make
me
quite
comfortable
for
the
rest
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
my
intention
to
leave
Welmingham
.
<EOS>
There
are
one
or
two
little
advantages
which
I
have
still
to
gain
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
The
clergyman
bows
to
me
 
as
you
saw
.
<EOS>
He
is
married
,
and
his
wife
is
not
quite
so
civil
.
<EOS>
I
propose
to
join
the
Dorcas
Society
,
and
I
mean
to
make
the
clergyman
's
wife
bow
to
me
next
.
  
<EOS>
If
you
favour
me
with
your
company
,
pray
understand
that
the
conversation
must
be
entirely
on
general
subjects
.
<EOS>
Any
attempted
reference
to
this
letter
will
be
quite
useless
 
<EOS>
I
am
determined
not
to
acknowledge
having
written
it
.
<EOS>
The
evidence
has
been
destroyed
in
the
fire
,
I
know
,
but
I
think
it
desirable
to
err
on
the
side
of
caution
,
nevertheless
.
  
<EOS>
On
this
account
no
names
are
mentioned
here
,
nor
is
any
signature
attached
to
these
lines
:
the
handwriting
is
disguised
throughout
,
and
I
mean
to
deliver
the
letter
myself
,
under
circumstances
which
will
prevent
all
fear
of
its
being
traced
to
my
house
.
<EOS>
You
can
have
no
possible
cause
to
complain
of
these
precautions
,
seeing
that
they
do
not
affect
the
information
I
here
communicate
,
in
consideration
of
the
special
indulgence
which
you
have
deserved
at
my
hands
.
<EOS>
My
hour
for
tea
is
half
-
past
five
,
and
my
buttered
toast
waits
for
nobody
.
  
<EOS>
THE
STORY
CONTINUED
BY
WALTER
HARTRIGHT
      
<EOS>
My
first
impulse
,
after
reading
Mrs.
Catherick
's
extraordinary
narrative
,
was
to
destroy
it
.
<EOS>
The
hardened
shameless
depravity
of
the
whole
composition
,
from
beginning
to
end
 
the
atrocious
perversity
of
mind
which
persistently
associated
me
with
a
calamity
for
which
I
was
in
no
sense
answerable
,
and
with
a
death
which
I
had
risked
my
life
in
trying
to
avert
 
<EOS>
so
disgusted
me
,
that
I
was
on
the
point
of
tearing
the
letter
,
when
a
consideration
suggested
itself
which
warned
me
to
wait
a
little
before
I
destroyed
it
.
  
<EOS>
This
consideration
was
entirely
unconnected
with
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
The
information
communicated
to
me
,
so
far
as
it
concerned
him
,
did
little
more
than
confirm
the
conclusions
at
which
I
had
already
arrived
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
committed
his
offence
,
as
I
had
supposed
him
to
have
committed
it
,
and
the
absence
of
all
reference
,
on
Mrs.
Catherick
's
part
,
to
the
duplicate
register
at
Knowlesbury
,
strengthened
my
previous
conviction
that
the
existence
of
the
book
,
and
the
risk
of
detection
which
it
implied
,
must
have
been
necessarily
unknown
to
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
My
interest
in
the
question
of
the
forgery
was
now
at
an
end
,
and
my
only
object
in
keeping
the
letter
was
to
make
it
of
some
future
service
in
clearing
up
the
last
mystery
that
still
remained
to
baffle
me
 
<EOS>
the
parentage
of
Anne
Catherick
on
the
father
's
side
.
<EOS>
There
were
one
or
two
sentences
dropped
in
her
mother
's
narrative
,
which
it
might
be
useful
to
refer
to
again
,
when
matters
of
more
immediate
importance
allowed
me
leisure
to
search
for
the
missing
evidence
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
despair
of
still
finding
that
evidence
,
and
I
had
lost
none
of
my
anxiety
to
discover
it
,
for
I
had
lost
none
of
my
interest
in
tracing
the
father
of
the
poor
creature
who
now
lay
at
rest
in
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
grave
.
  
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
I
sealed
up
the
letter
and
put
it
away
carefully
in
my
pocket
-
book
,
to
be
referred
to
again
when
the
time
came
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
was
my
last
in
Hampshire
.
<EOS>
When
I
had
appeared
again
before
the
magistrate
at
Knowlesbury
,
and
when
I
had
attended
at
the
adjourned
inquest
,
I
should
be
free
to
return
to
London
by
the
afternoon
or
the
evening
train
.
  
<EOS>
My
first
errand
in
the
morning
was
,
as
usual
,
to
the
post
-
office
.
<EOS>
The
letter
from
Marian
was
there
,
but
I
thought
when
it
was
handed
to
me
that
it
felt
unusually
light
.
<EOS>
I
anxiously
opened
the
envelope
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
inside
but
a
small
strip
of
paper
folded
in
two
.
<EOS>
The
few
blotted
hurriedly
-
written
lines
which
were
traced
on
it
contained
these
words
:
  
"
Come
back
as
soon
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
obliged
to
move
.
<EOS>
Come
to
Gower
's
Walk
,
Fulham
(
number
five
)
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
on
the
look
-
out
for
you
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
alarmed
about
us
,
we
are
both
safe
and
well
.
<EOS>
But
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
Marian
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
news
which
those
lines
contained
 
news
which
I
instantly
associated
with
some
attempted
treachery
on
the
part
of
Count
Fosco
 
fairly
overwhelmed
me
.
<EOS>
I
stood
breathless
with
the
paper
crumpled
up
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
What
had
happened
?
<EOS>
What
subtle
wickedness
had
the
Count
planned
and
executed
in
my
absence
?
<EOS>
A
night
had
passed
since
Marian
's
note
was
written
 
hours
must
elapse
still
before
I
could
get
back
to
them
 
<EOS>
some
new
disaster
might
have
happened
already
of
which
I
was
ignorant
.
<EOS>
And
here
,
miles
and
miles
away
from
them
,
here
I
must
remain
 
held
,
doubly
held
,
at
the
disposal
of
the
law
!
  
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
to
what
forgetfulness
of
my
obligations
anxiety
and
alarm
might
not
have
tempted
me
,
but
for
the
quieting
influence
of
my
faith
in
Marian
.
<EOS>
My
absolute
reliance
on
her
was
the
one
earthly
consideration
which
helped
me
to
restrain
myself
,
and
gave
me
courage
to
wait
.
<EOS>
The
inquest
was
the
first
of
the
impediments
in
the
way
of
my
freedom
of
action
.
<EOS>
I
attended
it
at
the
appointed
time
,
the
legal
formalities
requiring
my
presence
in
the
room
,
but
as
it
turned
out
,
not
calling
on
me
to
repeat
my
evidence
.
<EOS>
This
useless
delay
was
a
hard
trial
,
although
I
did
my
best
to
quiet
my
impatience
by
following
the
course
of
the
proceedings
as
closely
as
I
could
.
  
<EOS>
The
London
solicitor
of
the
deceased
(
Mr.
Merriman
)
was
among
the
persons
present
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
quite
unable
to
assist
the
objects
of
the
inquiry
.
<EOS>
He
could
only
say
that
he
was
inexpressibly
shocked
and
astonished
,
and
that
he
could
throw
no
light
whatever
on
the
mysterious
circumstances
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
At
intervals
during
the
adjourned
investigation
,
he
suggested
questions
which
the
Coroner
put
,
but
which
led
to
no
results
.
<EOS>
After
a
patient
inquiry
,
which
lasted
nearly
three
hours
,
and
which
exhausted
every
available
source
of
information
,
the
jury
pronounced
the
customary
verdict
in
cases
of
sudden
death
by
accident
.
<EOS>
They
added
to
the
formal
decision
a
statement
,
that
there
had
been
no
evidence
to
show
how
the
keys
had
been
abstracted
,
how
the
fire
had
been
caused
,
or
what
the
purpose
was
for
which
the
deceased
had
entered
the
vestry
.
<EOS>
This
act
closed
the
proceedings
.
<EOS>
The
legal
representative
of
the
dead
man
was
left
to
provide
for
the
necessities
of
the
interment
,
and
the
witnesses
were
free
to
retire
.
  
<EOS>
Resolved
not
to
lose
a
minute
in
getting
to
Knowlesbury
,
I
paid
my
bill
at
the
hotel
,
and
hired
a
fly
to
take
me
to
the
town
.
<EOS>
A
gentleman
who
heard
me
give
the
order
,
and
who
saw
that
I
was
going
alone
,
informed
me
that
he
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Knowlesbury
,
and
asked
if
I
would
have
any
objection
to
his
getting
home
by
sharing
the
fly
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
accepted
his
proposal
as
a
matter
of
course
.
  
<EOS>
Our
conversation
during
the
drive
was
naturally
occupied
by
the
one
absorbing
subject
of
local
interest
.
  
<EOS>
My
new
acquaintance
had
some
knowledge
of
the
late
Sir
Percival
's
solicitor
,
and
he
and
Mr.
Merriman
had
been
discussing
the
state
of
the
deceased
gentleman
's
affairs
and
the
succession
to
the
property
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
's
embarrassments
were
so
well
known
all
over
the
county
that
his
solicitor
could
only
make
a
virtue
of
necessity
and
plainly
acknowledge
them
.
<EOS>
He
had
died
without
leaving
a
will
,
and
he
had
no
personal
property
to
bequeath
,
even
if
he
had
made
one
,
the
whole
fortune
which
he
had
derived
from
his
wife
having
been
swallowed
up
by
his
creditors
.
<EOS>
The
heir
to
the
estate
<EOS>
(
Sir
Percival
having
left
no
issue
)
was
a
son
of
Sir
Felix
Glyde
's
first
cousin
,
an
officer
in
command
of
an
East
Indiaman
.
<EOS>
He
would
find
his
unexpected
inheritance
sadly
encumbered
,
but
the
property
would
recover
with
time
,
and
,
if
"
the
captain
"
was
careful
,
he
might
be
a
rich
man
yet
before
he
died
.
  
<EOS>
Absorbed
as
I
was
in
the
one
idea
of
getting
to
London
,
this
information
(
which
events
proved
to
be
perfectly
correct
)
had
an
interest
of
its
own
to
attract
my
attention
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
justified
me
in
keeping
secret
my
discovery
of
Sir
Percival
's
fraud
.
<EOS>
The
heir
,
whose
rights
he
had
usurped
,
was
the
heir
who
would
now
have
the
estate
.
<EOS>
The
income
from
it
,
for
the
last
three
-
and
-
twenty
years
,
which
should
properly
have
been
his
,
and
which
the
dead
man
had
squandered
to
the
last
farthing
,
was
gone
beyond
recall
.
<EOS>
If
I
spoke
,
my
speaking
would
confer
advantage
on
no
one
.
<EOS>
If
I
kept
the
secret
,
my
silence
concealed
the
character
of
the
man
who
had
cheated
Laura
into
marrying
him
.
<EOS>
For
her
sake
,
I
wished
to
conceal
it
 
for
her
sake
,
still
,
I
tell
this
story
under
feigned
names
.
  
<EOS>
I
parted
with
my
chance
companion
at
Knowlesbury
,
and
went
at
once
to
the
town
-
hall
.
<EOS>
As
I
had
anticipated
,
no
one
was
present
to
prosecute
the
case
against
me
 
the
necessary
formalities
were
observed
,
and
I
was
discharged
.
<EOS>
On
leaving
the
court
a
letter
from
Mr.
Dawson
was
put
into
my
hand
.
<EOS>
It
informed
me
that
he
was
absent
on
professional
duty
,
and
it
reiterated
the
offer
I
had
already
received
from
him
of
any
assistance
which
I
might
require
at
his
hands
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
back
,
warmly
acknowledging
my
obligations
to
his
kindness
,
and
apologising
for
not
expressing
my
thanks
personally
,
in
consequence
of
my
immediate
recall
on
pressing
business
to
town
.
  
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
later
I
was
speeding
back
to
London
by
the
express
train
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
between
nine
and
ten
o'clock
before
I
reached
Fulham
,
and
found
my
way
to
Gower
's
Walk
.
  
<EOS>
Both
Laura
and
Marian
came
to
the
door
to
let
me
in
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
had
hardly
known
how
close
the
tie
was
which
bound
us
three
together
,
until
the
evening
came
which
united
us
again
.
<EOS>
We
met
as
if
we
had
been
parted
for
months
instead
of
for
a
few
days
only
.
<EOS>
Marian
's
face
was
sadly
worn
and
anxious
.
<EOS>
I
saw
who
had
known
all
the
danger
and
borne
all
the
trouble
in
my
absence
the
moment
I
looked
at
her
.
<EOS>
Laura
's
brighter
looks
and
better
spirits
told
me
how
carefully
she
had
been
spared
all
knowledge
of
the
dreadful
death
at
Welmingham
,
and
of
the
true
reason
of
our
change
of
abode
.
  
<EOS>
The
stir
of
the
removal
seemed
to
have
cheered
and
interested
her
.
<EOS>
She
only
spoke
of
it
as
a
happy
thought
of
Marian
's
to
surprise
me
on
my
return
with
a
change
from
the
close
,
noisy
street
to
the
pleasant
neighbourhood
of
trees
and
fields
and
the
river
.
<EOS>
She
was
full
of
projects
for
the
future
 
of
the
drawings
she
was
to
finish
 
of
the
purchasers
I
had
found
in
the
country
who
were
to
buy
them
 
of
the
shillings
and
sixpences
she
had
saved
,
till
her
purse
was
so
heavy
that
she
proudly
asked
me
to
weigh
it
in
my
own
hand
.
<EOS>
The
change
for
the
better
which
had
been
wrought
in
her
during
the
few
days
of
my
absence
was
a
surprise
to
me
for
which
I
was
quite
unprepared
 
and
for
all
the
unspeakable
happiness
of
seeing
it
,
I
was
indebted
to
Marian
's
courage
and
to
Marian
's
love
.
  
<EOS>
When
Laura
had
left
us
,
and
when
we
could
speak
to
one
another
without
restraint
,
I
tried
to
give
some
expression
to
the
gratitude
and
the
admiration
which
filled
my
heart
.
<EOS>
But
the
generous
creature
would
not
wait
to
hear
me
.
<EOS>
That
sublime
self
-
forgetfulness
of
women
,
which
yields
so
much
and
asks
so
little
,
turned
all
her
thoughts
from
herself
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
only
a
moment
left
before
post
-
time
,
"
she
said
,
"
or
I
should
have
written
less
abruptly
.
<EOS>
You
look
worn
and
weary
,
Walter
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
my
letter
must
have
seriously
alarmed
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
at
first
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
My
mind
was
quieted
,
Marian
,
by
my
trust
in
you
.
<EOS>
Was
I
right
in
attributing
this
sudden
change
of
place
to
some
threatened
annoyance
on
the
part
of
Count
Fosco
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Perfectly
right
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
saw
him
yesterday
,
and
worse
than
that
,
Walter
 
I
spoke
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Spoke
to
him
?
<EOS>
Did
he
know
where
we
lived
?
<EOS>
Did
he
come
to
the
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
did
.
<EOS>
To
the
house
 
but
not
upstairs
.
<EOS>
Laura
never
saw
him
 
Laura
suspects
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
how
it
happened
:
the
danger
,
I
believe
and
hope
,
is
over
now
.
<EOS>
Yesterday
,
I
was
in
the
sitting
-
room
,
at
our
old
lodgings
.
<EOS>
Laura
was
drawing
at
the
table
,
and
I
was
walking
about
and
setting
things
to
rights
.
<EOS>
I
passed
the
window
,
and
as
I
passed
it
,
looked
out
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
There
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
,
I
saw
the
Count
,
with
a
man
talking
to
him
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Did
he
notice
you
at
the
window
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
 
at
least
,
I
thought
not
.
<EOS>
I
was
too
violently
startled
to
be
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
was
the
other
man
?
<EOS>
A
stranger
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
a
stranger
,
Walter
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
could
draw
my
breath
again
,
I
recognised
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
owner
of
the
Lunatic
Asylum
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Was
the
Count
pointing
out
the
house
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
they
were
talking
together
as
if
they
had
accidentally
met
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
I
remained
at
the
window
looking
at
them
from
behind
the
curtain
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
turned
round
,
and
if
Laura
had
seen
my
face
at
that
moment
 
<EOS>
Thank
God
,
she
was
absorbed
over
her
drawing
!
<EOS>
They
soon
parted
.
<EOS>
The
man
from
the
Asylum
went
one
way
,
and
the
Count
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
hope
they
were
in
the
street
by
chance
,
till
I
saw
the
Count
come
back
,
stop
opposite
to
us
again
,
take
out
his
card
-
case
and
pencil
,
write
something
,
and
then
cross
the
road
to
the
shop
below
us
.
<EOS>
I
ran
past
Laura
before
she
could
see
me
,
and
said
I
had
forgotten
something
upstairs
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
was
out
of
the
room
I
went
down
to
the
first
landing
and
waited
 
<EOS>
I
was
determined
to
stop
him
if
he
tried
to
come
upstairs
.
<EOS>
He
made
no
such
attempt
.
<EOS>
The
girl
from
the
shop
came
through
the
door
into
the
passage
,
with
his
card
in
her
hand
 
a
large
gilt
card
with
his
name
,
and
a
coronet
above
it
,
and
these
lines
underneath
in
pencil
:
<EOS>
"
Dear
lady
"
(
yes
!
<EOS>
the
villain
could
address
me
in
that
way
still
)
 
<EOS>
"
dear
lady
,
one
word
<EOS>
,
I
implore
you
,
on
a
matter
serious
to
us
both
.
<EOS>
"
If
one
can
think
at
all
,
in
serious
difficulties
,
one
thinks
quick
.
<EOS>
I
felt
directly
that
it
might
be
a
fatal
mistake
to
leave
myself
and
to
leave
you
in
the
dark
,
where
such
a
man
as
the
Count
was
concerned
.
<EOS>
I
felt
that
the
doubt
of
what
he
might
do
,
in
your
absence
,
would
be
ten
times
more
trying
to
me
if
I
declined
to
see
him
than
if
I
consented
.
"
<EOS>
Ask
the
gentleman
to
wait
in
the
shop
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
with
him
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
I
ran
upstairs
for
my
bonnet
,
being
determined
not
to
let
him
speak
to
me
indoors
.
<EOS>
I
knew
his
deep
ringing
voice
,
and
I
was
afraid
Laura
might
hear
it
,
even
in
the
shop
.
<EOS>
In
less
than
a
minute
I
was
down
again
in
the
passage
,
and
had
opened
the
door
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
He
came
round
to
meet
me
from
the
shop
.
<EOS>
There
he
was
in
deep
mourning
,
with
his
smooth
bow
and
his
deadly
smile
,
and
some
idle
boys
and
women
near
him
,
staring
at
his
great
size
,
his
fine
black
clothes
,
and
his
large
cane
with
the
gold
knob
to
it
.
<EOS>
All
the
horrible
time
at
Blackwater
came
back
to
me
the
moment
I
set
eyes
on
him
.
<EOS>
All
the
old
loathing
crept
and
crawled
through
me
,
when
he
took
off
his
hat
with
a
flourish
and
spoke
to
me
,
as
if
we
had
parted
on
the
friendliest
terms
hardly
a
day
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
remember
what
he
said
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
repeat
it
,
Walter
.
<EOS>
You
shall
know
directly
what
he
said
about
you
 
<EOS>
but
I
ca
n't
repeat
what
he
said
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
worse
than
the
polite
insolence
of
his
letter
.
<EOS>
My
hands
tingled
to
strike
him
,
as
if
I
had
been
a
man
!
<EOS>
I
only
kept
them
quiet
by
tearing
his
card
to
pieces
under
my
shawl
.
<EOS>
Without
saying
a
word
on
my
side
,
I
walked
away
from
the
house
(
for
fear
of
Laura
seeing
us
)
,
and
he
followed
,
protesting
softly
all
the
way
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
by
-
street
I
turned
,
and
asked
him
what
he
wanted
with
me
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
two
things
.
<EOS>
First
,
if
I
had
no
objection
,
to
express
his
sentiments
.
<EOS>
I
declined
to
hear
them
.
<EOS>
Secondly
,
to
repeat
the
warning
in
his
letter
.
<EOS>
I
asked
,
what
occasion
there
was
for
repeating
it
.
<EOS>
He
bowed
and
smiled
,
and
said
he
would
explain
.
<EOS>
The
explanation
exactly
confirmed
the
fears
I
expressed
before
you
left
us
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
,
if
you
remember
,
that
Sir
Percival
would
be
too
headstrong
to
take
his
friend
's
advice
where
you
were
concerned
,
and
that
there
was
no
danger
to
be
dreaded
from
the
Count
till
his
own
interests
were
threatened
,
and
he
was
roused
into
acting
for
himself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
recollect
,
Marian
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
so
it
has
really
turned
out
.
<EOS>
The
Count
offered
his
advice
,
but
it
was
refused
.
<EOS>
Sir
Percival
would
only
take
counsel
of
his
own
violence
,
his
own
obstinacy
,
and
his
own
hatred
of
you
.
<EOS>
The
Count
let
him
have
his
way
,
first
privately
ascertaining
,
in
case
of
his
own
interests
being
threatened
next
,
where
we
lived
.
<EOS>
You
were
followed
,
Walter
,
on
returning
here
,
after
your
first
journey
to
Hampshire
,
by
the
lawyer
's
men
for
some
distance
from
the
railway
,
and
by
the
Count
himself
to
the
door
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
How
he
contrived
to
escape
being
seen
by
you
<EOS>
he
did
not
tell
me
,
but
he
found
us
out
on
that
occasion
,
and
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
Having
made
the
discovery
,
he
took
no
advantage
of
it
till
the
news
reached
him
of
Sir
Percival
's
death
,
and
then
,
as
I
told
you
,
he
acted
for
himself
,
because
he
believed
you
would
next
proceed
against
the
dead
man
's
partner
in
the
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
He
at
once
made
his
arrangements
to
meet
the
owner
of
the
Asylum
in
London
,
and
to
take
him
to
the
place
where
his
runaway
patient
was
hidden
,
believing
that
the
results
,
whichever
way
they
ended
,
would
be
to
involve
you
in
interminable
legal
disputes
and
difficulties
,
and
to
tie
your
hands
for
all
purposes
of
offence
,
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
.
<EOS>
That
was
his
purpose
,
on
his
own
confession
to
me
.
<EOS>
The
only
consideration
which
made
him
hesitate
,
at
the
last
moment
 
"
  
"
Yes
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
hard
to
acknowledge
it
,
Walter
,
and
yet
I
must
.
<EOS>
I
was
the
only
consideration
.
<EOS>
No
words
can
say
how
degraded
I
feel
in
my
own
estimation
when
I
think
of
it
,
but
the
one
weak
point
in
that
man
's
iron
character
is
the
horrible
admiration
he
feels
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
tried
,
for
the
sake
of
my
own
self
-
respect
,
to
disbelieve
it
as
long
as
I
could
;
but
his
looks
,
his
actions
,
force
on
me
the
shameful
conviction
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
The
eyes
of
that
monster
of
wickedness
moistened
while
he
was
speaking
to
me
 
<EOS>
they
did
,
Walter
!
<EOS>
He
declared
that
at
the
moment
of
pointing
out
the
house
to
the
doctor
,
he
thought
of
my
misery
if
I
was
separated
from
Laura
,
of
my
responsibility
if
I
was
called
on
to
answer
for
effecting
her
escape
,
and
he
risked
the
worst
that
you
could
do
to
him
,
the
second
time
,
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
All
he
asked
was
that
I
would
remember
the
sacrifice
,
and
restrain
your
rashness
,
in
my
own
interests
 
interests
which
he
might
never
be
able
to
consult
again
.
<EOS>
I
made
no
such
bargain
with
him
 
<EOS>
I
would
have
died
first
.
<EOS>
But
believe
him
or
not
,
whether
it
is
true
or
false
that
he
sent
the
doctor
away
with
an
excuse
,
one
thing
is
certain
,
I
saw
the
man
leave
him
without
so
much
as
a
glance
at
our
window
,
or
even
at
our
side
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
,
Marian
.
<EOS>
The
best
men
are
not
consistent
in
good
 
<EOS>
why
should
the
worst
men
be
consistent
in
evil
?
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
I
suspect
him
of
merely
attempting
to
frighten
you
,
by
threatening
what
he
can
not
really
do
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
his
power
of
annoying
us
,
by
means
of
the
owner
of
the
Asylum
,
now
that
Sir
Percival
is
dead
,
and
Mrs.
Catherick
is
free
from
all
control
.
<EOS>
But
let
me
hear
more
.
<EOS>
What
did
the
Count
say
of
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
spoke
last
of
you
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
brightened
and
hardened
,
and
his
manner
changed
to
what
I
remember
it
in
past
times
 
to
that
mixture
of
pitiless
resolution
and
mountebank
mockery
which
makes
it
so
impossible
to
fathom
him
.
<EOS>
"
Warn
Mr.
Hartright
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
in
his
loftiest
manner
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
a
man
of
brains
to
deal
with
,
a
man
who
snaps
his
big
fingers
at
the
laws
and
conventions
of
society
,
when
he
measures
himself
with
ME
.
<EOS>
If
my
lamented
friend
had
taken
my
advice
,
the
business
of
the
inquest
would
have
been
with
the
body
of
Mr.
Hartright
.
<EOS>
But
my
lamented
friend
was
obstinate
.
<EOS>
See
!
<EOS>
I
mourn
his
loss
 
inwardly
in
my
soul
,
outwardly
on
my
hat
.
<EOS>
This
trivial
crape
expresses
sensibilities
which
I
summon
Mr.
Hartright
to
respect
.
<EOS>
They
may
be
transformed
to
immeasurable
enmities
if
he
ventures
to
disturb
them
.
<EOS>
Let
him
be
content
with
what
he
has
got
 
with
what
I
leave
unmolested
,
for
your
sake
,
to
him
and
to
you
.
<EOS>
Say
to
him
(
with
my
compliments
)
,
if
he
stirs
me
,
he
has
Fosco
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
In
the
English
of
the
Popular
Tongue
,
I
inform
him
 
Fosco
sticks
at
nothing
.
<EOS>
Dear
lady
,
good
morning
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
cold
grey
eyes
settled
on
my
face
 
<EOS>
he
took
off
his
hat
<EOS>
solemnly
 
bowed
,
bare
-
headed
 
and
left
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Without
returning
?
<EOS>
without
saying
more
last
words
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
turned
at
the
corner
of
the
street
,
and
waved
his
hand
,
and
then
struck
it
theatrically
on
his
breast
.
<EOS>
I
lost
sight
of
him
after
that
.
<EOS>
He
disappeared
in
the
opposite
direction
to
our
house
,
and
I
ran
back
to
Laura
.
<EOS>
Before
I
was
indoors
again
,
I
had
made
up
my
mind
that
we
must
go
.
<EOS>
The
house
(
especially
in
your
absence
)
was
a
place
of
danger
instead
of
a
place
of
safety
,
now
that
the
Count
had
discovered
it
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
have
felt
certain
of
your
return
,
I
should
have
risked
waiting
till
you
came
back
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
certain
of
nothing
,
and
I
acted
at
once
on
my
own
impulse
.
<EOS>
You
had
spoken
,
before
leaving
us
,
of
moving
into
a
quieter
neighbourhood
and
purer
air
,
for
the
sake
of
Laura
's
health
.
<EOS>
I
had
only
to
remind
her
of
that
,
and
to
suggest
surprising
you
and
saving
you
trouble
by
managing
the
move
in
your
absence
,
to
make
her
quite
as
anxious
for
the
change
as
I
was
.
<EOS>
She
helped
me
to
pack
up
your
things
,
and
she
has
arranged
them
all
for
you
in
your
new
working
-
room
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
made
you
think
of
coming
to
this
place
?
"
  
"
My
ignorance
of
other
localities
in
the
neighbourhood
of
London
.
<EOS>
I
felt
the
necessity
of
getting
as
far
away
as
possible
from
our
old
lodgings
,
and
I
knew
something
of
Fulham
,
because
I
had
once
been
at
school
there
.
<EOS>
I
despatched
a
messenger
with
a
note
,
on
the
chance
that
the
school
might
still
be
in
existence
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
existence
 
<EOS>
the
daughters
of
my
old
mistress
were
carrying
it
on
for
her
,
and
they
engaged
this
place
from
the
instructions
I
had
sent
.
<EOS>
It
was
just
post
-
time
when
the
messenger
returned
to
me
with
the
address
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
We
moved
after
dark
 
<EOS>
we
came
here
quite
unobserved
.
<EOS>
Have
I
done
right
,
Walter
?
<EOS>
Have
I
justified
your
trust
in
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
answered
her
warmly
and
gratefully
,
as
I
really
felt
.
<EOS>
But
the
anxious
look
still
remained
on
her
face
while
I
was
speaking
,
and
the
first
question
she
asked
,
when
I
had
done
,
related
to
Count
Fosco
.
  
<EOS>
I
saw
that
she
was
thinking
of
him
now
with
a
changed
mind
.
<EOS>
No
fresh
outbreak
of
anger
against
him
,
no
new
appeal
to
me
to
hasten
the
day
of
reckoning
escaped
her
.
<EOS>
Her
conviction
that
the
man
's
hateful
admiration
of
herself
was
really
sincere
,
seemed
to
have
increased
a
hundredfold
her
distrust
of
his
unfathomable
cunning
,
her
inborn
dread
of
the
wicked
energy
and
vigilance
of
all
his
faculties
.
<EOS>
Her
voice
fell
low
,
her
manner
was
hesitating
,
her
eyes
searched
into
mine
with
an
eager
fear
when
she
asked
me
what
I
thought
of
his
message
,
and
what
I
meant
to
do
next
after
hearing
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
many
weeks
have
passed
,
Marian
,
"
I
answered
,
"
since
my
interview
with
Mr.
Kyrle
.
<EOS>
When
he
and
I
parted
,
the
last
words
I
said
to
him
about
Laura
were
these
:
"
Her
uncle
's
house
shall
open
to
receive
her
,
in
the
presence
of
every
soul
who
followed
the
false
funeral
to
the
grave
;
the
lie
that
records
her
death
shall
be
publicly
erased
from
the
tombstone
by
the
authority
of
the
head
of
the
family
,
and
the
two
men
who
have
wronged
her
shall
answer
for
their
crime
to
ME
,
though
the
justice
that
sits
in
tribunals
is
powerless
to
pursue
them
.
<EOS>
"
One
of
those
men
is
beyond
mortal
reach
.
<EOS>
The
other
remains
,
and
my
resolution
remains
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
eyes
lit
up
 
her
colour
rose
.
<EOS>
She
said
nothing
,
but
I
saw
all
her
sympathies
gathering
to
mine
in
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
disguise
from
myself
,
or
from
you
,
"
I
went
on
,
"
that
the
prospect
before
us
is
more
than
doubtful
.
<EOS>
The
risks
we
have
run
already
are
,
it
may
be
,
trifles
compared
with
the
risks
that
threaten
us
in
the
future
,
but
the
venture
shall
be
tried
,
Marian
,
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
rash
enough
to
measure
myself
against
such
a
man
as
the
Count
before
I
am
well
prepared
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
learnt
patience
 
<EOS>
I
can
wait
my
time
.
<EOS>
Let
him
believe
that
his
message
has
produced
its
effect
 
let
him
know
nothing
of
us
,
and
hear
nothing
of
us
 
let
us
give
him
full
time
to
feel
secure
 
his
own
boastful
nature
,
unless
I
seriously
mistake
him
,
will
hasten
that
result
.
<EOS>
This
is
one
reason
for
waiting
,
but
there
is
another
more
important
still
.
<EOS>
My
position
,
Marian
,
towards
you
and
towards
Laura
ought
to
be
a
stronger
one
than
it
is
now
before
I
try
our
last
chance
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
leaned
near
to
me
,
with
a
look
of
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
it
be
stronger
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
you
,
"
I
replied
,
"
when
the
time
comes
.
<EOS>
It
has
not
come
yet
 
<EOS>
it
may
never
come
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
may
be
silent
about
it
to
Laura
for
ever
 
<EOS>
I
must
be
silent
now
,
even
to
YOU
,
till
I
see
for
myself
that
I
can
harmlessly
and
honourably
speak
.
<EOS>
Let
us
leave
that
subject
.
<EOS>
There
is
another
which
has
more
pressing
claims
on
our
attention
.
<EOS>
You
have
kept
Laura
,
mercifully
kept
her
,
in
ignorance
of
her
husband
's
death
 
"
  
"
Oh
,
Walter
,
surely
it
must
be
long
yet
before
we
tell
her
of
it
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
,
Marian
.
<EOS>
Better
that
you
should
reveal
it
to
her
now
,
than
<EOS>
that
accident
,
which
no
one
can
guard
against
,
should
reveal
it
to
her
at
some
future
time
.
<EOS>
Spare
her
all
the
details
 
break
it
to
her
very
tenderly
,
but
tell
her
that
he
is
dead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
reason
,
Walter
,
for
wishing
her
to
know
of
her
husband
's
death
besides
the
reason
you
have
just
mentioned
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
reason
connected
with
that
subject
which
must
not
be
mentioned
between
us
yet
?
 
<EOS>
which
may
never
be
mentioned
to
Laura
at
all
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
dwelt
on
the
last
words
meaningly
.
<EOS>
When
I
answered
her
in
the
affirmative
,
I
dwelt
on
them
too
.
  
<EOS>
Her
face
grew
pale
.
<EOS>
For
a
while
she
looked
at
me
with
a
sad
,
hesitating
interest
.
<EOS>
An
unaccustomed
tenderness
trembled
in
her
dark
eyes
and
softened
her
firm
lips
,
as
she
glanced
aside
at
the
empty
chair
in
which
the
dear
companion
of
all
our
joys
and
sorrows
had
been
sitting
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
understand
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
owe
it
to
her
and
to
you
,
Walter
,
to
tell
her
of
her
husband
's
death
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
sighed
,
and
held
my
hand
fast
for
a
moment
 
then
dropped
it
abruptly
,
and
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
On
the
next
day
Laura
knew
that
his
death
had
released
her
,
and
that
the
error
and
the
calamity
of
her
life
lay
buried
in
his
tomb
.
  
<EOS>
His
name
was
mentioned
among
us
no
more
.
<EOS>
Thenceforward
,
we
shrank
from
the
slightest
approach
to
the
subject
of
his
death
,
and
in
the
same
scrupulous
manner
,
Marian
and
I
avoided
all
further
reference
to
that
other
subject
,
which
,
by
her
consent
and
mine
,
was
not
to
be
mentioned
between
us
yet
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
less
present
in
our
minds
 
<EOS>
it
was
rather
kept
alive
in
them
by
the
restraint
which
we
had
imposed
on
ourselves
.
<EOS>
We
both
watched
Laura
more
anxiously
than
ever
,
sometimes
waiting
and
hoping
,
sometimes
waiting
and
fearing
,
till
the
time
came
.
  
<EOS>
By
degrees
we
returned
to
our
accustomed
way
of
life
.
<EOS>
I
resumed
the
daily
work
,
which
had
been
suspended
during
my
absence
in
Hampshire
.
<EOS>
Our
new
lodgings
cost
us
more
than
the
smaller
and
less
convenient
rooms
which
we
had
left
,
and
the
claim
thus
implied
on
my
increased
exertions
was
strengthened
by
the
doubtfulness
of
our
future
prospects
.
<EOS>
Emergencies
might
yet
happen
which
would
exhaust
our
little
fund
at
the
banker
's
,
and
the
work
of
my
hands
might
be
,
ultimately
,
all
we
had
to
look
to
for
support
.
<EOS>
More
permanent
and
more
lucrative
employment
than
had
yet
been
offered
to
me
was
a
necessity
of
our
position
 
a
necessity
for
which
I
now
diligently
set
myself
to
provide
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
supposed
that
the
interval
of
rest
and
seclusion
of
which
I
am
now
writing
,
entirely
suspended
,
on
my
part
,
all
pursuit
of
the
one
absorbing
purpose
with
which
my
thoughts
and
actions
are
associated
in
these
pages
.
<EOS>
That
purpose
was
,
for
months
and
months
yet
,
never
to
relax
its
claims
on
me
.
<EOS>
The
slow
ripening
of
it
still
left
me
a
measure
of
precaution
to
take
,
an
obligation
of
gratitude
to
perform
,
and
a
doubtful
question
to
solve
.
  
<EOS>
The
measure
of
precaution
related
,
necessarily
,
to
the
Count
.
<EOS>
It
was
of
the
last
importance
to
ascertain
,
if
possible
,
whether
his
plans
committed
him
to
remaining
in
England
 
or
,
in
other
words
,
to
remaining
within
my
reach
.
<EOS>
I
contrived
to
set
this
doubt
at
rest
by
very
simple
means
.
<EOS>
His
address
in
St.
John
's
Wood
being
known
to
me
,
I
inquired
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
having
found
out
the
agent
who
had
the
disposal
of
the
furnished
house
in
which
he
lived
,
I
asked
if
number
five
,
Forest
Road
,
was
likely
to
be
let
within
a
reasonable
time
.
<EOS>
The
reply
was
in
the
negative
.
<EOS>
I
was
informed
that
the
foreign
gentleman
then
residing
in
the
house
had
renewed
his
term
of
occupation
for
another
six
months
,
and
would
remain
in
possession
until
the
end
of
June
in
the
following
year
.
<EOS>
We
were
then
at
the
beginning
of
December
only
.
<EOS>
I
left
the
agent
with
my
mind
relieved
from
all
present
fear
of
the
Count
's
escaping
me
.
  
<EOS>
The
obligation
I
had
to
perform
took
me
once
more
into
the
presence
of
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
I
had
promised
to
return
,
and
to
confide
to
her
those
particulars
relating
to
the
death
and
burial
of
Anne
Catherick
which
I
had
been
obliged
to
withhold
at
our
first
interview
.
<EOS>
Changed
as
circumstances
now
were
,
there
was
no
hindrance
to
my
trusting
the
good
woman
with
as
much
of
the
story
of
the
conspiracy
as
it
was
necessary
to
tell
.
<EOS>
I
had
every
reason
that
sympathy
and
friendly
feeling
could
suggest
to
urge
on
me
the
speedy
performance
of
my
promise
,
and
I
did
conscientiously
and
carefully
perform
it
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
need
to
burden
these
pages
with
any
statement
of
what
passed
at
the
interview
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
more
to
the
purpose
to
say
,
that
the
interview
itself
necessarily
brought
to
my
mind
the
one
doubtful
question
still
remaining
to
be
solved
 
the
question
of
Anne
Catherick
's
parentage
on
the
father
's
side
.
  
<EOS>
A
multitude
of
small
considerations
in
connection
with
this
subject
 
trifling
enough
in
themselves
,
but
strikingly
important
when
massed
together
 
had
latterly
led
my
mind
to
a
conclusion
which
I
resolved
to
verify
.
<EOS>
I
obtained
Marian
's
permission
to
write
to
Major
Donthorne
,
of
Varneck
Hall
(
where
Mrs.
Catherick
had
lived
in
service
for
some
years
previous
to
her
marriage
)
,
to
ask
him
certain
questions
.
<EOS>
I
made
the
inquiries
in
Marian
's
name
,
and
described
them
as
relating
to
matters
of
personal
history
in
her
family
,
which
might
explain
and
excuse
my
application
.
<EOS>
When
I
wrote
the
letter
I
had
no
certain
knowledge
that
Major
Donthorne
was
still
alive
 
<EOS>
I
despatched
it
on
the
chance
that
he
might
be
living
,
and
able
and
willing
to
reply
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
lapse
of
two
days
proof
came
,
in
the
shape
of
a
letter
,
that
the
Major
was
living
,
and
that
he
was
ready
to
help
us
.
  
<EOS>
The
idea
in
my
mind
when
I
wrote
to
him
,
and
the
nature
of
my
inquiries
will
be
easily
inferred
from
his
reply
.
<EOS>
His
letter
answered
my
questions
by
communicating
these
important
facts
    
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
"
the
late
Sir
Percival
Glyde
,
of
Blackwater
Park
,
"
had
never
set
foot
in
Varneck
Hall
.
<EOS>
The
deceased
gentleman
was
a
total
stranger
to
Major
Donthorne
,
and
to
all
his
family
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
second
place
,
"
the
late
Mr.
Philip
Fairlie
,
of
Limmeridge
House
,
"
had
been
,
in
his
younger
days
,
the
intimate
friend
and
constant
guest
of
Major
Donthorne
.
<EOS>
Having
refreshed
his
memory
by
looking
back
to
old
letters
and
other
papers
,
the
Major
was
in
a
position
to
say
positively
that
Mr.
Philip
Fairlie
was
staying
at
Varneck
Hall
in
the
month
of
August
,
eighteen
hundred
and
twenty
-
six
,
and
that
he
remained
there
for
the
shooting
during
the
month
of
September
and
part
of
October
following
.
<EOS>
He
then
left
,
to
the
best
of
the
Major
's
belief
,
for
Scotland
,
and
did
not
return
to
Varneck
Hall
till
after
a
lapse
of
time
,
when
he
reappeared
in
the
character
of
a
newly
-
married
man
.
  
<EOS>
Taken
by
itself
,
this
statement
was
,
perhaps
,
of
little
positive
value
,
but
taken
in
connection
with
certain
facts
,
every
one
of
which
either
Marian
or
I
knew
to
be
true
,
it
suggested
one
plain
conclusion
that
was
,
to
our
minds
,
irresistible
.
  
<EOS>
Knowing
,
now
,
that
Mr.
Philip
Fairlie
had
been
at
Varneck
Hall
in
the
autumn
of
eighteen
hundred
and
twenty
-
six
,
and
that
Mrs.
Catherick
had
been
living
there
in
service
at
the
same
time
,
we
knew
also
 
first
,
that
Anne
had
been
born
in
June
,
eighteen
hundred
and
twenty
-
seven
;
secondly
,
that
she
had
always
presented
an
extraordinary
personal
resemblance
to
Laura
;
and
,
thirdly
,
that
Laura
herself
was
strikingly
like
her
father
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Philip
Fairlie
had
been
one
of
the
notoriously
handsome
men
of
his
time
.
<EOS>
In
disposition
entirely
unlike
his
brother
Frederick
,
he
was
the
spoilt
darling
of
society
,
especially
of
the
women
 
<EOS>
an
easy
,
light
-
hearted
,
impulsive
,
affectionate
man
 
generous
to
a
fault
 
constitutionally
lax
in
his
principles
,
and
notoriously
thoughtless
of
moral
obligations
where
women
were
concerned
.
<EOS>
Such
were
the
facts
we
knew
 
<EOS>
such
was
the
character
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
Surely
the
plain
inference
that
follows
needs
no
pointing
out
?
  
<EOS>
Read
by
the
new
light
which
had
now
broken
upon
me
,
even
Mrs.
Catherick
's
letter
,
in
despite
of
herself
,
rendered
its
mite
of
assistance
towards
strengthening
the
conclusion
at
which
I
had
arrived
.
<EOS>
She
had
described
Mrs.
Fairlie
(
in
writing
to
me
)
as
"
plain
-
looking
,
"
and
as
having
"
entrapped
the
handsomest
man
in
England
into
marrying
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Both
assertions
were
gratuitously
made
,
and
both
were
false
.
<EOS>
Jealous
dislike
(
which
,
in
such
a
woman
as
Mrs.
Catherick
,
would
express
itself
in
petty
malice
rather
than
not
express
itself
at
all
)
appeared
to
me
to
be
the
only
assignable
cause
for
the
peculiar
insolence
of
her
reference
to
Mrs.
Fairlie
,
under
circumstances
which
did
not
necessitate
any
reference
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
The
mention
here
of
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
name
naturally
suggests
one
other
question
.
<EOS>
Did
she
ever
suspect
whose
child
the
little
girl
brought
to
her
at
Limmeridge
might
be
?
  
<EOS>
Marian
's
testimony
was
positive
on
this
point
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
letter
to
her
husband
,
which
had
been
read
to
me
in
former
days
 
the
letter
describing
Anne
's
resemblance
to
Laura
,
and
acknowledging
her
affectionate
interest
in
the
little
stranger
 
had
been
written
,
beyond
all
question
,
in
perfect
innocence
of
heart
.
<EOS>
It
even
seemed
doubtful
,
on
consideration
,
whether
Mr.
Philip
Fairlie
himself
had
been
nearer
than
his
wife
to
any
suspicion
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
The
disgracefully
deceitful
circumstances
under
which
Mrs.
Catherick
had
married
,
the
purpose
of
concealment
which
the
marriage
was
intended
to
answer
,
might
well
keep
her
silent
for
caution
's
sake
,
perhaps
for
her
own
pride
's
sake
also
,
even
assuming
that
she
had
the
means
,
in
his
absence
,
of
communicating
with
the
father
of
her
unborn
child
.
  
<EOS>
As
this
surmise
floated
through
my
mind
,
there
rose
on
my
memory
the
remembrance
of
the
Scripture
denunciation
which
we
have
all
thought
of
in
our
time
with
wonder
and
with
awe
:
"
<EOS>
The
sins
of
the
fathers
shall
be
visited
on
the
children
.
"
<EOS>
But
for
the
fatal
resemblance
between
the
two
daughters
of
one
father
,
the
conspiracy
of
which
Anne
had
been
the
innocent
instrument
and
Laura
<EOS>
the
innocent
victim
could
never
have
been
planned
.
<EOS>
With
what
unerring
and
terrible
directness
the
long
chain
of
circumstances
led
down
from
the
thoughtless
wrong
committed
by
the
father
to
the
heartless
injury
inflicted
on
the
child
!
  
<EOS>
These
thoughts
came
to
me
,
and
others
with
them
,
which
drew
my
mind
away
to
the
little
Cumberland
churchyard
where
Anne
Catherick
now
lay
buried
.
<EOS>
I
thought
of
the
bygone
days
when
I
had
met
her
by
Mrs.
Fairlie
's
grave
,
and
met
her
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
I
thought
of
her
poor
helpless
hands
beating
on
the
tombstone
,
and
her
weary
,
yearning
words
,
murmured
to
the
dead
remains
of
her
protectress
and
her
friend
:
"
Oh
,
if
I
could
die
,
and
be
hidden
and
at
rest
with
YOU
!
"
<EOS>
Little
more
than
a
year
had
passed
since
she
breathed
that
wish
;
and
how
inscrutably
,
how
awfully
,
it
had
been
fulfilled
!
<EOS>
The
words
she
had
spoken
to
Laura
by
the
shores
of
the
lake
,
the
very
words
had
now
come
true
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
if
I
could
only
be
buried
with
your
mother
!
<EOS>
If
I
could
only
wake
at
her
side
when
the
angel
's
trumpet
sounds
and
the
graves
give
up
their
dead
at
the
resurrection
!
"
<EOS>
Through
what
mortal
crime
and
horror
,
through
what
darkest
windings
of
the
way
down
to
death
 
<EOS>
the
lost
creature
had
wandered
in
God
's
leading
to
the
last
home
that
,
living
,
she
never
hoped
to
reach
!
<EOS>
In
that
sacred
rest
I
leave
her
 
in
that
dread
companionship
<EOS>
let
her
remain
undisturbed
.
  
<EOS>
So
the
ghostly
figure
which
has
haunted
these
pages
,
as
it
haunted
my
life
,
goes
down
into
the
impenetrable
gloom
.
<EOS>
Like
a
shadow
she
first
came
to
me
in
the
loneliness
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
Like
a
shadow
she
passes
away
in
the
loneliness
of
the
dead
.
    
<EOS>
Four
months
elapsed
.
<EOS>
April
came
 
the
month
of
spring
 
the
month
of
change
.
  
<EOS>
The
course
of
time
had
flowed
through
the
interval
since
the
winter
peacefully
and
happily
in
our
new
home
.
<EOS>
I
had
turned
my
long
leisure
to
good
account
,
had
largely
increased
my
sources
of
employment
,
and
had
placed
our
means
of
subsistence
on
surer
grounds
.
<EOS>
Freed
from
the
suspense
and
the
anxiety
which
had
tried
her
so
sorely
and
hung
over
her
so
long
,
Marian
's
spirits
rallied
,
and
her
natural
energy
of
character
began
to
assert
itself
again
,
with
something
,
if
not
all
,
of
the
freedom
and
the
vigour
of
former
times
.
  
<EOS>
More
pliable
under
change
than
her
sister
,
Laura
showed
more
plainly
the
progress
made
by
the
healing
influences
of
her
new
life
.
<EOS>
The
worn
and
wasted
look
which
had
prematurely
aged
her
face
was
fast
leaving
it
,
and
the
expression
which
had
been
the
first
of
its
charms
in
past
days
was
the
first
of
its
beauties
that
now
returned
.
<EOS>
My
closest
observations
of
her
detected
but
<EOS>
one
serious
result
of
the
conspiracy
which
had
once
threatened
her
reason
and
her
life
.
<EOS>
Her
memory
of
events
,
from
the
period
of
her
leaving
Blackwater
Park
to
the
period
of
our
meeting
in
the
burial
-
ground
of
Limmeridge
Church
,
was
lost
beyond
all
hope
of
recovery
.
<EOS>
At
the
slightest
reference
to
that
time
she
changed
and
trembled
still
,
her
words
became
confused
,
her
memory
wandered
and
lost
itself
as
helplessly
as
ever
.
<EOS>
Here
,
and
here
only
,
the
traces
of
the
past
lay
deep
 
too
deep
to
be
effaced
.
  
<EOS>
In
all
else
she
was
now
so
far
on
the
way
to
recovery
that
,
on
her
best
and
brightest
days
,
she
sometimes
looked
and
spoke
like
the
Laura
of
old
times
.
<EOS>
The
happy
change
wrought
its
natural
result
in
us
both
.
<EOS>
From
their
long
slumber
,
on
her
side
and
on
mine
,
those
imperishable
memories
of
our
past
life
in
Cumberland
now
awoke
,
which
were
one
and
all
alike
,
the
memories
of
our
love
.
  
<EOS>
Gradually
and
insensibly
our
daily
relations
towards
each
other
became
constrained
.
<EOS>
The
fond
words
which
I
had
spoken
to
her
so
naturally
,
in
the
days
of
her
sorrow
and
her
suffering
,
faltered
strangely
on
my
lips
.
<EOS>
In
the
time
when
my
dread
of
losing
her
was
most
present
to
my
mind
,
I
had
always
kissed
her
when
she
left
me
at
night
and
when
she
met
me
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
The
kiss
seemed
now
to
have
dropped
between
us
 
to
be
lost
out
of
our
lives
.
<EOS>
Our
hands
began
to
tremble
again
when
they
met
.
<EOS>
We
hardly
ever
looked
long
at
one
another
out
of
Marian
's
presence
.
<EOS>
The
talk
often
flagged
between
us
when
we
were
alone
.
<EOS>
When
I
touched
her
by
accident
<EOS>
I
felt
my
heart
beating
fast
,
as
it
used
to
beat
at
Limmeridge
House
 
<EOS>
I
saw
the
lovely
answering
flush
glowing
again
in
her
cheeks
,
as
if
we
were
back
among
the
Cumberland
Hills
in
our
past
characters
of
master
and
pupil
once
more
.
<EOS>
She
had
long
intervals
of
silence
and
thoughtfulness
,
and
denied
she
had
been
thinking
when
Marian
asked
her
the
question
.
<EOS>
I
surprised
myself
one
day
neglecting
my
work
to
dream
over
the
little
water
-
colour
portrait
of
her
which
I
had
taken
in
the
summer
-
house
where
we
first
met
 
just
as
I
used
to
neglect
Mr.
Fairlie
's
drawings
to
dream
over
the
same
likeness
when
it
was
newly
finished
in
the
bygone
time
.
<EOS>
Changed
as
all
the
circumstances
now
were
,
our
position
towards
each
other
in
the
golden
days
of
our
first
companionship
seemed
to
be
revived
with
the
revival
of
our
love
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
Time
had
drifted
us
back
on
the
wreck
of
our
early
hopes
to
the
old
familiar
shore
!
  
<EOS>
To
any
other
woman
I
could
have
spoken
the
decisive
words
which
I
still
hesitated
to
speak
to
HER
.
<EOS>
The
utter
helplessness
of
her
position
 
her
friendless
dependence
on
all
the
forbearing
gentleness
that
I
could
show
her
 
my
fear
of
touching
too
soon
some
secret
sensitiveness
in
her
which
<EOS>
my
instinct
as
a
man
might
not
have
been
fine
enough
to
discover
 
these
considerations
,
and
others
like
them
,
kept
me
self
-
distrustfully
silent
.
<EOS>
And
yet
I
knew
that
the
restraint
on
both
sides
must
be
ended
,
that
the
relations
in
which
we
stood
towards
one
another
must
be
altered
in
some
settled
manner
for
the
future
,
and
that
it
rested
with
me
,
in
the
first
instance
,
to
recognise
the
necessity
for
a
change
.
  
<EOS>
The
more
I
thought
of
our
position
,
the
harder
the
attempt
to
alter
it
appeared
,
while
the
domestic
conditions
on
which
we
three
had
been
living
together
since
the
winter
remained
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
account
for
the
capricious
state
of
mind
in
which
this
feeling
originated
,
but
the
idea
nevertheless
possessed
me
that
some
previous
change
of
place
and
circumstances
,
some
sudden
break
in
the
quiet
monotony
of
our
lives
,
so
managed
as
to
vary
the
home
aspect
under
which
we
had
been
accustomed
to
see
each
other
,
might
prepare
the
way
for
me
to
speak
,
and
might
make
it
easier
and
less
embarrassing
for
Laura
and
Marian
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
With
this
purpose
in
view
,
I
said
,
one
morning
,
that
I
thought
we
had
all
earned
a
little
holiday
and
a
change
of
scene
.
<EOS>
After
some
consideration
,
it
was
decided
that
we
should
go
for
a
fortnight
to
the
sea
-
side
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
next
day
we
left
Fulham
for
a
quiet
town
on
the
south
coast
.
<EOS>
At
that
early
season
of
the
year
we
were
the
only
visitors
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
The
cliffs
,
the
beach
,
and
the
walks
inland
were
all
in
the
solitary
condition
which
was
most
welcome
to
us
.
<EOS>
The
air
was
mild
 
the
prospects
over
hill
and
wood
and
down
were
beautifully
varied
by
the
shifting
April
light
and
shade
,
and
the
restless
sea
leapt
under
our
windows
,
as
if
it
felt
,
like
the
land
,
the
glow
and
freshness
of
spring
.
  
<EOS>
I
owed
it
to
Marian
to
consult
her
before
I
spoke
to
Laura
,
and
to
be
guided
afterwards
by
her
advice
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
third
day
from
our
arrival
I
found
a
fit
opportunity
of
speaking
to
her
alone
.
<EOS>
The
moment
we
looked
at
one
another
,
her
quick
instinct
detected
the
thought
in
my
mind
before
I
could
give
it
expression
.
<EOS>
With
her
customary
energy
and
directness
she
spoke
at
once
,
and
spoke
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
thinking
of
that
subject
which
was
mentioned
between
us
on
the
evening
of
your
return
from
Hampshire
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
expecting
you
to
allude
to
it
for
some
time
past
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
a
change
in
our
little
household
,
Walter
,
we
can
not
go
on
much
longer
as
we
are
now
.
<EOS>
I
see
it
as
plainly
as
you
do
 
as
plainly
as
Laura
sees
it
,
though
she
says
nothing
.
<EOS>
How
strangely
the
old
times
in
Cumberland
seem
to
have
come
back
!
<EOS>
You
and
I
are
together
again
,
and
the
one
subject
of
interest
between
us
is
Laura
once
more
.
<EOS>
I
could
almost
fancy
that
this
room
is
the
summer
-
house
at
Limmeridge
,
and
that
those
waves
beyond
us
are
beating
on
our
sea
-
shore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
guided
by
your
advice
in
those
past
days
,
"
I
said
,
"
and
now
,
Marian
,
with
reliance
tenfold
greater
I
will
be
guided
by
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
answered
by
pressing
my
hand
.
<EOS>
I
saw
that
she
was
deeply
touched
by
my
reference
to
the
past
.
<EOS>
We
sat
together
near
the
window
,
and
while
I
spoke
<EOS>
and
she
listened
<EOS>
,
we
looked
at
the
glory
of
the
sunlight
shining
on
the
majesty
of
the
sea
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whatever
comes
of
this
confidence
between
us
,
"
I
said
,
"
whether
it
ends
happily
or
sorrowfully
for
ME
,
Laura
's
interests
will
still
be
the
interests
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
When
we
leave
this
place
,
on
whatever
terms
we
leave
it
,
my
determination
to
wrest
from
Count
Fosco
the
confession
which
I
failed
to
obtain
from
his
accomplice
,
goes
back
with
me
to
London
,
as
certainly
as
I
go
back
myself
.
<EOS>
Neither
you
nor
I
can
tell
how
that
man
may
turn
on
me
,
if
I
bring
him
to
bay
;
we
only
know
,
by
his
own
words
and
actions
,
that
he
is
capable
of
striking
at
me
through
Laura
,
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
or
a
moment
's
remorse
.
<EOS>
In
our
present
position
I
have
no
claim
on
her
which
society
sanctions
,
which
the
law
allows
,
to
strengthen
me
in
resisting
him
,
and
in
protecting
HER
.
<EOS>
This
places
me
at
a
serious
disadvantage
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
to
fight
our
cause
with
the
Count
,
strong
in
the
consciousness
of
Laura
's
safety
,
I
must
fight
it
for
my
Wife
.
<EOS>
Do
you
agree
to
that
,
Marian
,
so
far
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
every
word
of
it
,
"
she
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
plead
out
of
my
own
heart
,
"
I
went
on
;
"
I
will
not
appeal
to
the
love
which
has
survived
all
changes
and
all
shocks
 
I
will
rest
my
only
vindication
of
myself
for
thinking
of
her
,
and
speaking
of
her
as
my
wife
,
on
what
I
have
just
said
.
<EOS>
If
the
chance
of
forcing
a
confession
from
the
Count
is
,
as
I
believe
it
to
be
,
the
last
chance
left
of
publicly
establishing
the
fact
of
Laura
's
existence
,
the
least
selfish
reason
that
I
can
advance
for
our
marriage
is
recognised
by
us
both
.
<EOS>
But
I
may
be
wrong
in
my
conviction
 
<EOS>
other
means
of
achieving
our
purpose
may
be
in
our
power
,
which
are
less
uncertain
and
less
dangerous
.
<EOS>
I
have
searched
anxiously
,
in
my
own
mind
,
for
those
means
,
and
I
have
not
found
them
.
<EOS>
Have
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
I
have
thought
about
it
too
,
and
thought
in
vain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
all
likelihood
,
"
I
continued
,
"
the
same
questions
have
occurred
to
you
,
in
considering
this
difficult
subject
,
which
have
occurred
to
me
.
<EOS>
Ought
we
to
return
with
her
to
Limmeridge
,
now
that
she
is
like
herself
again
,
and
trust
to
the
recognition
of
her
by
the
people
of
the
village
,
or
by
the
children
at
the
school
?
<EOS>
Ought
we
to
appeal
to
the
practical
test
of
her
handwriting
?
<EOS>
Suppose
we
did
so
.
<EOS>
Suppose
the
recognition
of
her
obtained
,
and
the
identity
of
the
handwriting
established
.
<EOS>
Would
success
in
both
those
cases
do
more
than
supply
an
excellent
foundation
for
a
trial
in
a
court
of
law
?
<EOS>
Would
the
recognition
and
the
handwriting
prove
her
identity
to
Mr.
Fairlie
and
take
her
back
to
Limmeridge
House
,
against
the
evidence
of
her
aunt
,
against
the
evidence
of
the
medical
certificate
,
against
the
fact
of
the
funeral
and
the
fact
of
the
inscription
on
the
tomb
?
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
We
could
only
hope
to
succeed
in
throwing
a
serious
doubt
on
the
assertion
of
her
death
,
a
doubt
which
nothing
short
of
a
legal
inquiry
can
settle
.
<EOS>
I
will
assume
that
we
possess
(
what
we
have
certainly
not
got
)
<EOS>
money
enough
to
carry
this
inquiry
on
through
all
its
stages
.
<EOS>
I
will
assume
that
Mr.
Fairlie
's
prejudices
might
be
reasoned
away
 
that
the
false
testimony
of
the
Count
and
his
wife
,
and
all
the
rest
of
the
false
testimony
,
might
be
confuted
 
that
the
recognition
could
not
possibly
be
ascribed
to
a
mistake
between
Laura
and
Anne
Catherick
,
or
the
handwriting
be
declared
by
our
enemies
to
be
a
clever
fraud
 
all
these
are
assumptions
which
,
more
or
less
,
set
plain
probabilities
at
defiance
;
but
let
them
pass
 
and
let
us
ask
ourselves
what
would
be
the
first
consequence
or
the
first
questions
put
to
Laura
herself
on
the
subject
of
the
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
We
know
only
too
well
what
the
consequence
would
be
,
for
we
know
that
she
has
never
recovered
her
memory
of
what
happened
to
her
in
London
.
<EOS>
Examine
her
privately
,
or
examine
her
publicly
,
she
is
utterly
incapable
of
assisting
the
assertion
of
her
own
case
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
see
this
,
Marian
,
as
plainly
as
I
see
it
,
we
will
go
to
Limmeridge
and
try
the
experiment
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
DO
see
it
,
Walter
.
<EOS>
Even
if
we
had
the
means
of
paying
all
the
law
expenses
,
even
if
we
succeeded
in
the
end
,
the
delays
would
be
unendurable
,
the
perpetual
suspense
,
after
what
we
have
suffered
already
,
would
be
heartbreaking
.
<EOS>
You
are
right
about
the
hopelessness
of
going
to
Limmeridge
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
feel
sure
that
you
are
right
also
in
determining
to
try
that
last
chance
with
the
Count
.
<EOS>
IS
it
a
chance
at
all
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Beyond
a
doubt
,
Yes
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
chance
of
recovering
the
lost
date
of
Laura
's
journey
to
London
.
<EOS>
Without
returning
to
the
reasons
I
gave
you
some
time
since
,
I
am
still
as
firmly
persuaded
as
ever
that
there
is
a
discrepancy
between
the
date
of
that
journey
and
the
date
on
the
certificate
of
death
.
<EOS>
There
lies
the
weak
point
of
the
whole
conspiracy
 
<EOS>
it
crumbles
to
pieces
if
we
attack
it
in
that
way
,
and
the
means
of
attacking
it
are
in
possession
of
the
Count
.
<EOS>
If
I
succeed
in
wresting
them
from
him
,
the
object
of
your
life
and
mine
is
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
If
I
fail
,
the
wrong
that
Laura
has
suffered
will
,
in
this
world
,
never
be
redressed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
fear
failure
yourself
,
Walter
?
"
  
"
I
dare
not
anticipate
success
,
and
for
that
very
reason
,
Marian
,
I
speak
openly
and
plainly
as
I
have
spoken
now
.
<EOS>
In
my
heart
and
my
conscience
I
can
say
it
,
Laura
's
hopes
for
the
future
are
at
their
lowest
ebb
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
her
fortune
is
gone
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
the
last
chance
of
restoring
her
to
her
place
in
the
world
lies
at
the
mercy
of
her
worst
enemy
,
of
a
man
who
is
now
absolutely
unassailable
,
and
who
may
remain
unassailable
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
With
every
worldly
advantage
gone
from
her
,
with
all
prospect
of
recovering
her
rank
and
station
more
than
doubtful
,
with
no
clearer
future
before
her
than
the
future
which
her
husband
can
provide
,
the
poor
drawing
-
master
may
harmlessly
open
his
heart
at
last
.
<EOS>
In
the
days
of
her
prosperity
,
Marian
,
I
was
only
the
teacher
who
guided
her
hand
 
<EOS>
I
ask
for
it
,
in
her
adversity
,
as
the
hand
of
my
wife
!
"
  
<EOS>
Marian
's
eyes
met
mine
affectionately
 
<EOS>
I
could
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
My
heart
was
full
,
my
lips
were
trembling
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
myself
I
was
in
danger
of
appealing
to
her
pity
.
<EOS>
I
got
up
to
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
She
rose
at
the
same
moment
,
laid
her
hand
gently
on
my
shoulder
,
and
stopped
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Walter
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
I
once
parted
you
both
,
for
your
good
and
for
hers
.
<EOS>
Wait
here
,
my
brother
!
 
<EOS>
wait
,
my
dearest
,
best
friend
,
till
Laura
comes
,
and
tells
you
what
I
have
done
now
!
"
  
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
since
the
farewell
morning
at
Limmeridge
<EOS>
she
touched
my
forehead
with
her
lips
.
<EOS>
A
tear
dropped
on
my
face
as
she
kissed
me
.
<EOS>
She
turned
quickly
,
pointed
to
the
chair
from
which
I
had
risen
,
and
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
sat
down
alone
at
the
window
to
wait
through
the
crisis
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
My
mind
in
that
breathless
interval
felt
like
a
total
blank
.
<EOS>
I
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
a
painful
intensity
of
all
familiar
perceptions
.
<EOS>
The
sun
grew
blinding
bright
,
the
white
sea
birds
chasing
each
other
far
beyond
me
seemed
to
be
flitting
before
my
face
,
<EOS>
the
mellow
murmur
of
the
waves
on
the
beach
was
like
thunder
in
my
ears
.
  
<EOS>
The
door
opened
,
and
Laura
came
in
alone
.
<EOS>
So
she
had
entered
the
breakfast
-
room
at
Limmeridge
House
on
the
morning
when
we
parted
.
<EOS>
Slowly
and
falteringly
,
in
sorrow
and
in
hesitation
,
she
had
once
approached
me
.
<EOS>
Now
she
came
with
the
haste
of
happiness
in
her
feet
,
with
the
light
of
happiness
radiant
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
Of
their
own
accord
those
dear
arms
clasped
themselves
round
me
,
of
their
own
accord
the
sweet
lips
came
to
meet
mine
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
darling
!
"
<EOS>
she
whispered
,
"
we
may
own
we
love
each
other
now
?
"
<EOS>
Her
head
nestled
with
a
tender
contentedness
on
my
bosom
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
"
she
said
innocently
,
"
I
am
so
happy
at
last
!
"
  
<EOS>
Ten
days
later
we
were
happier
still
.
<EOS>
We
were
married
.
    
<EOS>
The
course
of
this
narrative
,
steadily
flowing
on
,
bears
me
away
from
the
morning
-
time
of
our
married
life
,
and
carries
me
forward
to
the
end
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
fortnight
more
we
three
were
back
in
London
,
and
the
shadow
was
stealing
over
us
of
the
struggle
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
Marian
and
I
were
careful
to
keep
Laura
in
ignorance
of
the
cause
that
had
hurried
us
back
 
the
necessity
of
making
sure
of
the
Count
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
the
beginning
of
May
,
and
his
term
of
occupation
at
the
house
in
Forest
Road
expired
in
June
.
<EOS>
If
he
renewed
it
(
and
I
had
reasons
,
shortly
to
be
mentioned
,
for
anticipating
that
he
would
)
,
I
might
be
certain
of
his
not
escaping
me
.
<EOS>
But
if
by
any
chance
he
disappointed
my
expectations
and
left
the
country
,
then
I
had
no
time
to
lose
in
arming
myself
to
meet
him
as
I
best
might
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
first
fulness
of
my
new
happiness
,
there
had
been
moments
when
my
resolution
faltered
 
moments
when
I
was
tempted
to
be
safely
content
,
now
that
the
dearest
aspiration
of
my
life
was
fulfilled
in
the
possession
of
Laura
's
love
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
I
thought
faint
-
heartedly
of
the
greatness
of
the
risk
,
of
the
adverse
chances
arrayed
against
me
,
of
the
fair
promise
of
our
new
life
,
and
of
the
peril
in
which
I
might
place
the
happiness
which
we
had
so
hardly
earned
.
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
let
me
own
it
honestly
.
<EOS>
For
a
brief
time
I
wandered
,
in
the
sweet
guiding
of
love
,
far
from
the
purpose
to
which
I
had
been
true
under
sterner
discipline
and
in
darker
days
.
<EOS>
Innocently
Laura
had
tempted
me
aside
from
the
hard
path
 
<EOS>
innocently
she
was
destined
to
lead
me
back
again
.
  
<EOS>
At
times
,
dreams
of
the
terrible
past
still
disconnectedly
recalled
to
her
,
in
the
mystery
of
sleep
,
the
events
of
which
her
waking
memory
had
lost
all
trace
.
<EOS>
One
night
(
barely
two
weeks
after
our
marriage
)
,
when
I
was
watching
her
at
rest
,
I
saw
the
tears
come
slowly
through
her
closed
eyelids
,
I
heard
the
faint
murmuring
words
escape
her
which
told
me
that
her
spirit
was
back
again
on
the
fatal
journey
from
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
That
unconscious
appeal
,
so
touching
and
so
awful
in
the
sacredness
of
her
sleep
,
ran
through
me
like
fire
.
<EOS>
The
next
day
was
the
day
we
came
back
to
London
 
<EOS>
the
day
when
my
resolution
returned
to
me
with
tenfold
strength
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
necessity
was
to
know
something
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
Thus
far
,
the
true
story
of
his
life
was
an
impenetrable
mystery
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
began
with
such
scanty
sources
of
information
as
were
at
my
own
disposal
.
<EOS>
The
important
narrative
written
by
Mr.
Frederick
Fairlie
(
which
Marian
had
obtained
by
following
the
directions
I
had
given
to
her
in
the
winter
)
proved
to
be
of
no
service
to
the
special
object
with
which
I
now
looked
at
it
.
<EOS>
While
reading
it
I
reconsidered
the
disclosure
revealed
to
me
by
Mrs.
Clements
of
the
series
of
deceptions
which
had
brought
Anne
Catherick
to
London
,
and
which
had
there
devoted
her
to
the
interests
of
the
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
Here
,
again
,
the
Count
had
not
openly
committed
himself
 
here
,
again
,
he
was
,
to
all
practical
purpose
,
out
of
my
reach
.
  
<EOS>
I
next
returned
to
Marian
's
journal
at
Blackwater
Park
.
<EOS>
At
my
request
she
read
to
me
again
a
passage
which
referred
to
her
past
curiosity
about
the
Count
,
and
to
the
few
particulars
which
she
had
discovered
relating
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
passage
to
which
I
allude
occurs
in
that
part
of
her
journal
which
delineates
his
character
and
his
personal
appearance
.
<EOS>
She
describes
him
as
"
not
having
crossed
the
frontiers
of
his
native
country
for
years
past
"
 
as
"
anxious
to
know
if
any
Italian
gentlemen
were
settled
in
the
nearest
town
to
Blackwater
Park
"
 
as
"
receiving
letters
with
all
sorts
of
odd
stamps
on
them
,
and
one
with
a
large
official
-
looking
seal
on
it
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
inclined
to
consider
that
his
long
absence
from
his
native
country
may
be
accounted
for
by
assuming
that
he
is
a
political
exile
.
<EOS>
But
she
is
,
on
the
other
hand
,
unable
to
reconcile
this
idea
with
the
reception
of
the
letter
from
abroad
bearing
"
the
large
official
-
looking
seal
"
 
<EOS>
letters
from
the
Continent
addressed
to
political
exiles
being
usually
the
last
to
court
attention
from
foreign
post
-
offices
in
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
The
considerations
thus
presented
to
me
in
the
diary
,
joined
to
certain
surmises
of
my
own
that
grew
out
of
them
,
suggested
a
conclusion
which
I
wondered
I
had
not
arrived
at
before
.
<EOS>
I
now
said
to
myself
 
<EOS>
what
Laura
had
once
said
to
Marian
at
Blackwater
Park
,
what
Madame
Fosco
had
overheard
by
listening
at
the
door
 
<EOS>
the
Count
is
a
spy
!
  
<EOS>
Laura
had
applied
the
word
to
him
at
hazard
,
in
natural
anger
at
his
proceedings
towards
herself
.
<EOS>
I
applied
it
to
him
with
the
deliberate
conviction
that
his
vocation
in
life
was
the
vocation
of
a
spy
.
<EOS>
On
this
assumption
,
the
reason
for
his
extraordinary
stay
in
England
so
long
after
the
objects
of
the
conspiracy
had
been
gained
,
became
,
to
my
mind
,
quite
intelligible
.
  
<EOS>
The
year
of
which
I
am
now
writing
was
the
year
of
the
famous
Crystal
Palace
Exhibition
in
Hyde
Park
.
<EOS>
Foreigners
in
unusually
large
numbers
had
arrived
already
,
and
were
still
arriving
in
England
.
<EOS>
Men
were
among
us
by
hundreds
whom
the
ceaseless
distrustfulness
of
their
governments
had
followed
privately
,
by
means
of
appointed
agents
,
to
our
shores
.
<EOS>
My
surmises
did
not
for
a
moment
class
a
man
of
the
Count
's
abilities
and
social
position
with
the
ordinary
rank
and
file
of
foreign
spies
.
<EOS>
I
suspected
him
of
holding
a
position
of
authority
,
of
being
entrusted
by
the
government
which
he
secretly
served
with
the
organisation
and
management
of
agents
specially
employed
in
this
country
,
both
men
and
women
,
and
I
believed
Mrs.
Rubelle
,
who
had
been
so
opportunely
found
to
act
as
nurse
at
Blackwater
Park
,
to
be
,
in
all
probability
,
one
of
the
number
.
  
<EOS>
Assuming
that
this
idea
of
mine
had
a
foundation
in
truth
,
the
position
of
the
Count
might
prove
to
be
more
assailable
than
I
had
hitherto
ventured
to
hope
.
<EOS>
To
whom
could
I
apply
to
know
something
more
of
the
man
's
history
and
of
the
man
himself
than
I
knew
now
?
  
<EOS>
In
this
emergency
it
naturally
occurred
to
my
mind
that
a
countryman
of
his
own
,
on
whom
I
could
rely
,
might
be
the
fittest
person
to
help
me
.
<EOS>
The
first
man
whom
I
thought
of
under
these
circumstances
was
also
the
only
Italian
with
whom
I
was
intimately
acquainted
 
my
quaint
little
friend
,
Professor
Pesca
.
  
<EOS>
The
professor
has
been
so
long
absent
from
these
pages
that
he
has
run
some
risk
of
being
forgotten
altogether
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
the
necessary
law
of
such
a
story
as
mine
that
the
persons
concerned
in
it
only
appear
when
the
course
of
events
takes
them
up
 
<EOS>
they
come
and
go
,
not
by
favour
of
my
personal
partiality
,
but
by
right
of
their
direct
connection
with
the
circumstances
to
be
detailed
.
<EOS>
For
this
reason
,
not
Pesca
alone
,
but
my
mother
and
sister
as
well
,
have
been
left
far
in
the
background
of
the
narrative
.
<EOS>
My
visits
to
the
Hampstead
cottage
,
my
mother
's
belief
in
the
denial
of
Laura
's
identity
which
the
conspiracy
had
accomplished
,
my
vain
efforts
to
overcome
the
prejudice
on
her
part
and
on
my
sister
's
to
which
,
in
their
jealous
affection
for
me
,
they
both
continued
to
adhere
,
the
painful
necessity
which
that
prejudice
imposed
on
me
of
concealing
my
marriage
from
them
till
they
had
learnt
to
do
justice
to
my
wife
 
all
these
little
domestic
occurrences
have
been
left
unrecorded
because
they
were
not
essential
to
the
main
interest
of
the
story
.
<EOS>
It
is
nothing
that
they
added
to
my
anxieties
and
embittered
my
disappointments
 
<EOS>
the
steady
march
of
events
has
inexorably
passed
them
by
.
  
<EOS>
For
the
same
reason
I
have
said
nothing
here
of
the
consolation
that
I
found
in
Pesca
's
brotherly
affection
for
me
,
when
I
saw
him
again
after
the
sudden
cessation
of
my
residence
at
Limmeridge
House
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
recorded
the
fidelity
with
which
my
warm
-
hearted
little
friend
followed
me
to
the
place
of
embarkation
when
I
sailed
for
Central
America
,
or
the
noisy
transport
of
joy
with
which
he
received
me
when
we
next
met
in
London
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
felt
justified
in
accepting
the
offers
of
service
which
he
made
to
me
on
my
return
,
he
would
have
appeared
again
long
ere
this
.
<EOS>
But
,
though
I
knew
that
his
honour
and
his
courage
were
to
be
implicitly
relied
on
,
I
was
not
so
sure
that
his
discretion
was
to
be
trusted
,
and
,
for
that
reason
only
,
I
followed
the
course
of
all
my
inquiries
alone
.
<EOS>
It
will
now
be
sufficiently
understood
that
Pesca
was
not
separated
from
all
connection
with
me
and
my
interests
,
although
he
has
hitherto
been
separated
from
all
connection
with
the
progress
of
this
narrative
.
<EOS>
He
was
as
true
and
as
ready
<EOS>
a
friend
of
mine
still
as
ever
he
had
been
in
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
Before
I
summoned
Pesca
to
my
assistance
it
was
necessary
to
see
for
myself
what
sort
of
man
I
had
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
Up
to
this
time
I
had
never
once
set
eyes
on
Count
Fosco
.
  
<EOS>
Three
days
after
my
return
with
Laura
and
Marian
to
London
,
I
set
forth
alone
for
Forest
Road
,
St.
John
's
Wood
,
between
ten
and
eleven
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
fine
day
 
<EOS>
I
had
some
hours
to
spare
 
<EOS>
and
I
thought
it
likely
,
if
I
waited
a
little
for
him
,
that
the
Count
might
be
tempted
out
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
great
reason
to
fear
the
chance
of
his
recognising
me
in
the
daytime
,
for
the
only
occasion
when
I
had
been
seen
by
him
was
the
occasion
on
which
he
had
followed
me
home
at
night
.
  
<EOS>
No
one
appeared
at
the
windows
in
the
front
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
walked
down
a
turning
which
ran
past
the
side
of
it
,
and
looked
over
the
low
garden
wall
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
back
windows
on
the
lower
floor
was
thrown
up
and
a
net
was
stretched
across
the
opening
.
<EOS>
I
saw
nobody
,
but
I
heard
,
in
the
room
,
first
a
shrill
whistling
and
singing
of
birds
,
then
the
deep
ringing
voice
which
Marian
's
description
had
made
familiar
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
Come
out
on
my
little
finger
,
my
pret
-
pret
-
pretties
!
"
cried
the
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Come
out
and
hop
upstairs
!
<EOS>
One
,
two
,
three
 
and
up
!
<EOS>
Three
,
two
,
one
 
and
down
!
<EOS>
One
,

,

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Count
was
exercising
his
canaries
as
he
used
to
exercise
them
in
Marian
's
time
at
Blackwater
Park
.
  
<EOS>
I
waited
a
little
while
,
and
the
singing
and
the
whistling
ceased
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
kiss
me
,
my
pretties
!
"
said
the
deep
voice
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
responsive
twittering
and
chirping
 
a
low
,
oily
laugh
 
a
silence
of
a
minute
or
so
,
and
then
I
heard
the
opening
of
the
house
door
.
<EOS>
I
turned
and
retraced
my
steps
.
<EOS>
The
magnificent
melody
of
the
Prayer
in
Rossini
's
Moses
,
sung
in
a
sonorous
bass
voice
,
rose
grandly
through
the
suburban
silence
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
The
front
garden
gate
opened
and
closed
.
<EOS>
The
Count
had
come
out
.
  
<EOS>
He
crossed
the
road
and
walked
towards
the
western
boundary
of
the
Regent
's
Park
.
<EOS>
I
kept
on
my
own
side
of
the
way
,
a
little
behind
him
,
and
walked
in
that
direction
also
.
  
<EOS>
Marian
had
prepared
me
for
his
high
stature
,
his
monstrous
corpulence
,
and
his
ostentatious
mourning
garments
,
but
not
for
the
horrible
freshness
and
cheerfulness
and
vitality
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
He
carried
his
sixty
years
as
if
they
had
been
fewer
than
forty
.
<EOS>
He
sauntered
along
,
wearing
his
hat
a
little
on
one
side
,
with
a
light
jaunty
step
,
swinging
his
big
stick
,
humming
to
himself
,
looking
up
from
time
to
time
at
the
houses
and
gardens
on
either
side
of
him
with
superb
,
smiling
patronage
.
<EOS>
If
a
stranger
had
been
told
that
the
whole
neighbourhood
belonged
to
him
,
that
stranger
would
not
have
been
surprised
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
He
never
looked
back
,
he
paid
no
apparent
attention
to
me
,
no
apparent
attention
to
any
one
who
passed
him
on
his
own
side
of
the
road
,
except
now
and
then
,
when
he
smiled
and
smirked
,
with
an
easy
paternal
good
humour
,
at
the
nursery
-
maids
and
the
children
whom
he
met
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
he
led
me
on
,
till
we
reached
a
colony
of
shops
outside
the
western
terraces
of
the
Park
.
  
<EOS>
Here
he
stopped
at
a
pastrycook
's
,
went
in
(
probably
to
give
an
order
)
,
and
came
out
again
immediately
with
a
tart
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
An
Italian
was
grinding
an
organ
before
the
shop
,
and
a
miserable
little
shrivelled
monkey
was
sitting
on
the
instrument
.
<EOS>
The
Count
stopped
,
bit
a
piece
for
himself
out
of
the
tart
,
and
gravely
handed
the
rest
to
the
monkey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
poor
little
man
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
with
grotesque
tenderness
,
"
you
look
hungry
.
<EOS>
In
the
sacred
name
of
humanity
,
I
offer
you
some
lunch
!
"
<EOS>
The
organ
-
grinder
piteously
put
in
his
claim
to
a
penny
from
the
benevolent
stranger
.
<EOS>
The
Count
shrugged
his
shoulders
contemptuously
,
and
passed
on
.
  
<EOS>
We
reached
the
streets
and
the
better
class
of
shops
between
the
New
Road
and
Oxford
Street
.
<EOS>
The
Count
stopped
again
and
entered
a
small
optician
's
shop
,
with
an
inscription
in
the
window
announcing
that
repairs
were
neatly
executed
inside
.
<EOS>
He
came
out
again
with
an
opera
-
glass
in
his
hand
,
walked
a
few
paces
on
,
and
stopped
to
look
at
a
bill
of
the
opera
placed
outside
a
music
-
seller
's
shop
.
<EOS>
He
read
the
bill
attentively
,
considered
a
moment
,
and
then
hailed
an
empty
cab
as
it
passed
him
.
"
<EOS>
Opera
Box
-
office
,
"
he
said
to
the
man
,
and
was
driven
away
.
  
<EOS>
I
crossed
the
road
,
and
looked
at
the
bill
in
my
turn
.
<EOS>
The
performance
announced
was
Lucrezia
Borgia
,
and
it
was
to
take
place
that
evening
.
<EOS>
The
opera
-
glass
in
the
Count
's
hand
,
his
careful
reading
of
the
bill
,
and
his
direction
to
the
cabman
,
all
suggested
that
he
proposed
making
one
of
the
audience
.
<EOS>
I
had
the
means
of
getting
an
admission
for
myself
and
a
friend
to
the
pit
by
applying
to
one
of
the
scene
-
painters
attached
to
the
theatre
,
with
whom
I
had
been
well
acquainted
in
past
times
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
chance
at
least
that
the
Count
might
be
easily
visible
among
the
audience
to
me
and
to
any
one
with
me
,
and
in
this
case
I
had
the
means
of
ascertaining
whether
Pesca
knew
his
countryman
or
not
that
very
night
.
  
<EOS>
This
consideration
at
once
decided
the
disposal
of
my
evening
.
<EOS>
I
procured
the
tickets
,
leaving
a
note
at
the
Professor
's
lodgings
on
the
way
.
<EOS>
At
a
quarter
to
eight
I
called
to
take
him
with
me
to
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
My
little
friend
was
in
a
state
of
the
highest
excitement
,
with
a
festive
flower
in
his
button
-
hole
,
and
the
largest
opera
-
glass
I
ever
saw
hugged
up
under
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
ready
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Right
-
all
-
right
,
"
said
Pesca
.
  
<EOS>
We
started
for
the
theatre
.
    
<EOS>
The
last
notes
of
the
introduction
to
the
opera
were
being
played
,
and
the
seats
in
the
pit
were
all
filled
,
when
Pesca
and
I
reached
the
theatre
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
plenty
of
room
,
however
,
in
the
passage
that
ran
round
the
pit
 
precisely
the
position
best
calculated
to
answer
the
purpose
for
which
I
was
attending
the
performance
.
<EOS>
I
went
first
to
the
barrier
separating
us
from
the
stalls
,
and
looked
for
the
Count
in
that
part
of
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
Returning
along
the
passage
,
on
the
left
-
hand
side
from
the
stage
,
and
looking
about
me
attentively
,
I
discovered
him
in
the
pit
.
<EOS>
He
occupied
an
excellent
place
,
some
twelve
or
fourteen
seats
from
the
end
of
a
bench
,
within
three
rows
of
the
stalls
.
<EOS>
I
placed
myself
exactly
on
a
line
with
him
.
<EOS>
Pesca
standing
by
my
side
.
<EOS>
The
Professor
was
not
yet
aware
of
the
purpose
for
which
I
had
brought
him
to
the
theatre
,
and
he
was
rather
surprised
that
we
did
not
move
nearer
to
the
stage
.
  
<EOS>
The
curtain
rose
,
and
the
opera
began
.
  
<EOS>
Throughout
the
whole
of
the
first
act
we
remained
in
our
position
 
the
Count
,
absorbed
by
the
orchestra
and
the
stage
,
never
casting
so
much
as
a
chance
glance
at
us
.
<EOS>
Not
a
note
of
Donizetti
's
delicious
music
was
lost
on
him
.
<EOS>
There
he
sat
,
high
above
his
neighbours
,
smiling
,
and
nodding
his
great
head
enjoyingly
from
time
to
time
.
<EOS>
When
the
people
near
him
applauded
the
close
of
an
air
(
as
an
English
audience
in
such
circumstances
always
WILL
applaud
)
,
without
the
least
consideration
for
the
orchestral
movement
which
immediately
followed
it
,
he
looked
round
at
them
with
an
expression
of
compassionate
remonstrance
,
and
held
up
one
hand
with
a
gesture
of
polite
entreaty
.
<EOS>
At
the
more
refined
passages
of
the
singing
,
at
the
more
delicate
phases
of
the
music
,
which
passed
unapplauded
by
others
,
his
fat
hands
,
adorned
with
perfectly
-
fitting
black
kid
gloves
,
softly
patted
each
other
,
in
token
of
the
cultivated
appreciation
of
a
musical
man
.
<EOS>
At
such
times
,
his
oily
murmur
of
approval
,
"
Bravo
!
<EOS>
Bra
-
a
-
a
-
a
!
"
<EOS>
hummed
through
the
silence
,
like
the
purring
of
a
great
cat
.
<EOS>
His
immediate
neighbours
on
either
side
 
hearty
,
ruddy
-
faced
people
from
the
country
,
basking
amazedly
in
the
sunshine
of
fashionable
London
 
seeing
and
hearing
him
,
began
to
follow
his
lead
.
<EOS>
Many
a
burst
of
applause
from
the
pit
that
night
started
from
the
soft
,
comfortable
patting
of
the
black
-
gloved
hands
.
<EOS>
The
man
's
voracious
vanity
devoured
this
implied
tribute
to
his
local
and
critical
supremacy
with
an
appearance
of
the
highest
relish
.
<EOS>
Smiles
rippled
continuously
over
his
fat
face
.
<EOS>
He
looked
about
him
,
at
the
pauses
in
the
music
,
serenely
satisfied
with
himself
and
his
fellow
-
creatures
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
these
barbarous
English
people
are
learning
something
from
ME
.
<EOS>
Here
,
there
,
and
everywhere
,
I
 
Fosco
 
am
an
influence
that
is
felt
,
a
man
who
sits
supreme
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
ever
face
spoke
,
his
face
spoke
then
,
and
that
was
its
language
.
  
<EOS>
The
curtain
fell
on
the
first
act
,
and
the
audience
rose
to
look
about
them
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
time
I
had
waited
for
 
the
time
to
try
if
Pesca
knew
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
rose
with
the
rest
,
and
surveyed
the
occupants
of
the
boxes
grandly
with
his
opera
-
glass
.
<EOS>
At
first
his
back
was
towards
us
,
but
he
turned
round
in
time
,
to
our
side
of
the
theatre
,
and
looked
at
the
boxes
above
us
,
using
his
glass
for
a
few
minutes
 
then
removing
it
,
but
still
continuing
to
look
up
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
moment
I
chose
,
when
his
full
face
was
in
view
,
for
directing
Pesca
's
attention
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
that
man
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Which
man
,
my
friend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
tall
,
fat
man
,
standing
there
,
with
his
face
towards
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
Pesca
raised
himself
on
tiptoe
,
and
looked
at
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
the
Professor
.
<EOS>
"
The
big
fat
man
is
a
stranger
to
me
.
<EOS>
Is
he
famous
?
<EOS>
Why
do
you
point
him
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
have
particular
reasons
for
wishing
to
know
something
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
countryman
of
yours
 
<EOS>
his
name
is
Count
Fosco
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
that
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
I
,
Walter
.
<EOS>
Neither
the
name
nor
the
man
is
known
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
quite
sure
you
do
n't
recognise
him
?
<EOS>
Look
again
 
look
carefully
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
why
I
am
so
anxious
about
it
when
we
leave
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
Stop
!
<EOS>
let
me
help
you
up
here
,
where
you
can
see
him
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
helped
the
little
man
to
perch
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
raised
dais
upon
which
the
pit
-
seats
were
all
placed
.
<EOS>
His
small
stature
was
no
hindrance
to
him
 
<EOS>
here
he
could
see
over
the
heads
of
the
ladies
who
were
seated
near
the
outermost
part
of
the
bench
.
  
<EOS>
A
slim
,
light
-
haired
man
standing
by
us
,
whom
I
had
not
noticed
before
 
a
man
with
a
scar
on
his
left
cheek
 
looked
attentively
at
Pesca
as
I
helped
him
up
,
and
then
looked
still
more
attentively
,
following
the
direction
of
Pesca
's
eyes
,
at
the
Count
.
<EOS>
Our
conversation
might
have
reached
his
ears
,
and
might
,
as
it
struck
me
,
have
roused
his
curiosity
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Pesca
fixed
his
eyes
earnestly
on
the
broad
,
full
,
smiling
face
<EOS>
turned
a
little
upward
,
exactly
opposite
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
have
never
set
my
two
eyes
on
that
big
fat
man
before
in
all
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
the
Count
looked
downwards
towards
the
boxes
behind
us
on
the
pit
tier
.
  
<EOS>
The
eyes
of
the
two
Italians
met
.
  
<EOS>
The
instant
before
I
had
been
perfectly
satisfied
,
from
his
own
reiterated
assertion
,
that
Pesca
did
not
know
the
Count
.
<EOS>
The
instant
afterwards
I
was
equally
certain
that
the
Count
knew
Pesca
!
  
<EOS>
Knew
him
,
and
 
more
surprising
still
 
FEARED
him
as
well
!
<EOS>
There
was
no
mistaking
the
change
that
passed
over
the
villain
's
face
.
<EOS>
The
leaden
hue
that
altered
his
yellow
complexion
in
a
moment
,
the
sudden
rigidity
of
all
his
features
,
the
furtive
scrutiny
of
his
cold
grey
eyes
,
the
motionless
stillness
of
him
from
head
to
foot
told
their
own
tale
.
<EOS>
A
mortal
dread
had
mastered
him
body
and
soul
 
and
his
own
recognition
of
Pesca
was
the
cause
of
it
!
  
<EOS>
The
slim
man
with
the
scar
on
his
cheek
was
still
close
by
us
.
<EOS>
He
had
apparently
drawn
his
inference
from
the
effect
produced
on
the
Count
by
the
sight
of
Pesca
as
I
had
drawn
mine
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
mild
,
gentlemanlike
man
,
looking
like
a
foreigner
,
and
his
interest
in
our
proceedings
was
not
expressed
in
anything
approaching
to
an
offensive
manner
.
  
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
I
was
so
startled
by
the
change
in
the
Count
's
face
,
so
astounded
at
the
entirely
unexpected
turn
which
events
had
taken
,
that
I
knew
neither
what
to
say
or
do
next
.
<EOS>
Pesca
roused
me
by
stepping
back
to
his
former
place
at
my
side
and
speaking
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
the
fat
man
stares
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
at
ME
?
<EOS>
Am
I
famous
?
<EOS>
How
can
he
know
me
when
I
do
n't
know
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
kept
my
eye
still
on
the
Count
.
<EOS>
I
saw
him
move
for
the
first
time
when
Pesca
moved
,
so
as
not
to
lose
sight
of
the
little
man
in
the
lower
position
in
which
he
now
stood
.
<EOS>
I
was
curious
to
see
what
would
happen
if
Pesca
's
attention
under
these
circumstances
was
withdrawn
from
him
,
and
I
accordingly
asked
the
Professor
if
he
recognised
any
of
his
pupils
that
evening
among
the
ladies
in
the
boxes
.
<EOS>
Pesca
immediately
raised
the
large
opera
-
glass
to
his
eyes
,
and
moved
it
slowly
all
round
the
upper
part
of
the
theatre
,
searching
for
his
pupils
with
the
most
conscientious
scrutiny
.
  
<EOS>
The
moment
he
showed
himself
to
be
thus
engaged
the
Count
turned
round
,
slipped
past
the
persons
who
occupied
seats
on
the
farther
side
of
him
from
where
we
stood
,
and
disappeared
in
the
middle
passage
down
the
centre
of
the
pit
.
<EOS>
I
caught
Pesca
by
the
arm
,
and
to
his
inexpressible
astonishment
,
hurried
him
round
with
me
to
the
back
of
the
pit
to
intercept
the
Count
before
he
could
get
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
Somewhat
to
my
surprise
,
the
slim
man
hastened
out
before
us
,
avoiding
a
stoppage
caused
by
some
people
on
our
side
of
the
pit
leaving
their
places
,
by
which
Pesca
and
myself
were
delayed
.
<EOS>
When
we
reached
the
lobby
the
Count
had
disappeared
,
and
the
foreigner
with
the
scar
was
gone
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
home
,
"
<EOS>
I
said
;
"
come
home
,
Pesca
to
your
lodgings
.
<EOS>
I
must
speak
to
you
in
private
 
<EOS>
I
must
speak
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
-
soul
-
bless
-
my
-
soul
!
"
cried
the
Professor
,
in
a
state
of
the
extremest
bewilderment
.
<EOS>
"
What
on
earth
is
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
walked
on
rapidly
without
answering
.
<EOS>
The
circumstances
under
which
the
Count
had
left
the
theatre
suggested
to
me
that
his
extraordinary
anxiety
to
escape
Pesca
might
carry
him
to
further
extremities
still
.
<EOS>
He
might
escape
me
,
too
,
by
leaving
London
.
<EOS>
I
doubted
the
future
if
I
allowed
him
so
much
as
a
day
's
freedom
to
act
as
he
pleased
.
<EOS>
And
I
doubted
that
foreign
stranger
,
who
had
got
the
start
of
us
,
and
whom
I
suspected
of
intentionally
following
him
out
.
  
<EOS>
With
this
double
distrust
in
my
mind
,
I
was
not
long
in
making
Pesca
understand
what
I
wanted

<EOS>
As
soon
as
we
two
were
alone
in
his
room
,
I
increased
his
confusion
and
amazement
a
hundredfold
by
telling
him
what
my
purpose
was
as
plainly
and
unreservedly
as
I
have
acknowledged
it
here
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
friend
,
what
can
I
do
?
"
cried
the
Professor
,
piteously
appealing
to
me
with
both
hands
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Deuce
-
what
-
the
-
deuce
!
<EOS>
how
can
I
help
you
,
Walter
,
when
I
do
n't
know
the
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
HE
knows
YOU
 
<EOS>
he
is
afraid
of
you
 
<EOS>
he
has
left
the
theatre
to
escape
you
.
<EOS>
Pesca
!
<EOS>
there
must
be
a
reason
for
this
.
<EOS>
Look
back
into
your
own
life
before
you
came
to
England
.
<EOS>
You
left
Italy
,
as
you
have
told
me
yourself
,
for
political
reasons
.
<EOS>
You
have
never
mentioned
those
reasons
to
me
,
and
I
do
n't
inquire
into
them
now
.
<EOS>
I
only
ask
you
to
consult
your
own
recollections
,
and
to
say
if
they
suggest
<EOS>
no
past
cause
for
the
terror
which
the
first
sight
of
you
produced
in
that
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
To
my
unutterable
surprise
,
these
words
,
harmless
as
they
appeared
to
ME
,
produced
the
same
astounding
effect
on
Pesca
which
the
sight
of
Pesca
had
produced
on
the
Count
.
<EOS>
The
rosy
face
of
my
little
friend
whitened
in
an
instant
,
and
he
drew
back
from
me
slowly
,
trembling
from
head
to
foot
.
  
<EOS>
"
Walter
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
what
you
ask
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
spoke
in
a
whisper
 
<EOS>
he
looked
at
me
as
if
I
had
suddenly
revealed
to
him
some
hidden
danger
to
both
of
us
.
<EOS>
In
less
than
one
minute
of
time
he
was
so
altered
from
the
easy
,
lively
,
quaint
little
man
of
all
my
past
experience
,
that
if
I
had
met
him
in
the
street
,
changed
as
I
saw
him
now
,
I
should
most
certainly
not
have
known
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Forgive
me
,
if
I
have
unintentionally
pained
and
shocked
you
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Remember
the
cruel
wrong
my
wife
has
suffered
at
Count
Fosco
's
hands
.
<EOS>
Remember
that
the
wrong
can
never
be
redressed
,
unless
the
means
are
in
my
power
of
forcing
him
to
do
her
justice
.
<EOS>
I
spoke
in
HER
interests
,
Pesca
 
I
ask
you
again
to
forgive
me
 
I
can
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
rose
to
go
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
me
before
I
reached
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wait
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
shaken
me
from
head
to
foot
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
how
I
left
my
country
,
and
why
I
left
my
country
.
<EOS>
Let
me
compose
myself
,
let
me
think
,
if
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
returned
to
my
chair
.
<EOS>
He
walked
up
and
down
the
room
,
talking
to
himself
incoherently
in
his
own
language
.
<EOS>
After
several
turns
backwards
and
forwards
,
he
suddenly
came
up
to
me
,
and
laid
his
little
hands
with
a
strange
tenderness
and
solemnity
on
my
breast
.
  
<EOS>
"
On
your
heart
and
soul
,
Walter
,
"
he
said
,
"
is
there
no
other
way
to
get
to
that
man
but
the
chance
-
way
through
ME
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
other
way
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
He
left
me
again
,
opened
the
door
of
the
room
and
looked
out
cautiously
into
the
passage
,
closed
it
once
more
,
and
came
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
won
your
right
over
me
,
Walter
,
"
he
said
,
"
on
the
day
when
you
saved
my
life
.
<EOS>
It
was
yours
from
that
moment
,
when
you
pleased
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
Take
it
now
.
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
I
mean
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
My
next
words
,
as
true
as
the
good
God
is
above
us
,
will
put
my
life
into
your
hands
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
trembling
earnestness
with
which
he
uttered
this
extraordinary
warning
,
carried
with
it
,
to
my
mind
,
the
conviction
that
he
spoke
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mind
this
!
"
<EOS>
he
went
on
,
shaking
his
hands
at
me
in
the
vehemence
of
his
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
I
hold
no
thread
,
in
my
own
mind
,
between
that
man
Fosco
,
and
the
past
time
which
I
call
back
to
me
for
your
sake
.
<EOS>
If
you
find
the
thread
,
keep
it
to
yourself
 
tell
me
nothing
 
on
my
knees
I
beg
and
pray
,
<EOS>
let
me
be
ignorant
,
let
me
be
innocent
,
let
me
be
blind
to
all
the
future
as
I
am
now
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
said
a
few
words
more
,
hesitatingly
and
disconnectedly
,
then
stopped
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
saw
that
the
effort
of
expressing
himself
in
English
,
on
an
occasion
too
serious
to
permit
him
the
use
of
the
quaint
turns
and
phrases
of
his
ordinary
vocabulary
,
was
painfully
increasing
the
difficulty
he
had
felt
from
the
first
in
speaking
to
me
at
all
.
<EOS>
Having
learnt
to
read
and
understand
his
native
language
(
though
not
to
speak
it
)
,
in
the
earlier
days
of
our
intimate
companionship
,
I
now
suggested
to
him
that
he
should
express
himself
in
Italian
,
while
I
used
English
in
putting
any
questions
which
might
be
necessary
to
my
enlightenment
.
<EOS>
He
accepted
the
proposal
.
<EOS>
In
his
smooth
-
flowing
language
,
spoken
with
a
vehement
agitation
which
betrayed
itself
in
the
perpetual
working
of
his
features
,
in
the
wildness
and
the
suddenness
of
his
foreign
gesticulations
,
but
never
in
the
raising
of
his
voice
,
I
now
heard
the
words
which
armed
me
to
meet
the
last
struggle
,
that
is
left
for
this
story
to
record.[3
]
  
<EOS>
[

]
It
is
only
right
to
mention
here
,
that
I
repeat
Pesco
's
statement
to
me
with
the
careful
suppressions
and
alterations
which
the
serious
nature
of
the
subject
and
my
own
sense
of
duty
to
my
friend
demand
.
<EOS>
My
first
and
last
concealments
from
the
reader
are
those
which
caution
renders
absolutely
necessary
in
this
portion
of
the
narrative
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
nothing
of
my
motive
for
leaving
Italy
,
"
he
began
,
"
except
that
it
was
for
political
reasons
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
driven
to
this
country
by
the
persecution
of
my
government
,
I
should
not
have
kept
those
reasons
a
secret
from
you
or
from
any
one
.
<EOS>
I
have
concealed
them
because
no
government
authority
has
pronounced
the
sentence
of
my
exile
.
<EOS>
You
have
heard
,
Walter
,
of
the
political
societies
that
are
hidden
in
every
great
city
on
the
continent
of
Europe
?
<EOS>
To
one
of
those
societies
I
belonged
in
Italy
 
and
belong
still
in
England
.
<EOS>
When
I
came
to
this
country
,
I
came
by
the
direction
of
my
chief
.
<EOS>
I
was
over
-
zealous
in
my
younger
time
 
<EOS>
I
ran
the
risk
of
compromising
myself
and
others
.
<EOS>
For
those
reasons
I
was
ordered
to
emigrate
to
England
and
to
wait
.
<EOS>
I
emigrated
 
<EOS>
I
have
waited
 
<EOS>
I
wait
still
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
may
be
called
away
 
ten
years
<EOS>
hence
I
may
be
called
away
.
<EOS>
It
is
all
one
to
me
 
<EOS>
I
am
here
,
I
support
myself
by
teaching
,
and
I
wait
.
<EOS>
I
violate
no
oath
(
you
shall
hear
why
presently
)
in
making
my
confidence
complete
by
telling
you
the
name
of
the
society
to
which
I
belong
.
<EOS>
All
I
do
is
to
put
my
life
in
your
hands
.
<EOS>
If
what
I
say
to
you
now
is
ever
known
by
others
to
have
passed
my
lips
,
as
certainly
as
we
two
sit
here
,
I
am
a
dead
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
whispered
the
next
words
in
my
ear
.
<EOS>
I
keep
the
secret
which
he
thus
communicated
.
<EOS>
The
society
to
which
he
belonged
will
be
sufficiently
individualised
for
the
purpose
of
these
pages
,
if
I
call
it
"
The
Brotherhood
,
"
on
the
few
occasions
when
any
reference
to
the
subject
will
be
needed
in
this
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
object
of
the
Brotherhood
,
"
Pesca
went
on
,
"
is
,
briefly
,
the
object
of
other
political
societies
of
the
same
sort
 
the
destruction
of
tyranny
and
the
assertion
of
the
rights
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
The
principles
of
the
Brotherhood
are
two
.
<EOS>
So
long
as
a
man
's
life
is
useful
,
or
even
harmless
only
,
he
has
the
right
to
enjoy
it
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
his
life
inflicts
injury
on
the
well
-
being
of
his
fellow
-
men
,
from
that
moment
he
forfeits
the
right
,
and
it
is
not
only
no
crime
,
but
a
positive
merit
,
to
deprive
him
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
for
me
to
say
in
what
frightful
circumstances
of
oppression
and
suffering
this
society
took
its
rise
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
for
you
to
say
 
you
Englishmen
,
who
have
conquered
your
freedom
so
long
ago
,
that
you
have
conveniently
forgotten
what
blood
you
shed
,
and
what
extremities
you
proceeded
to
in
the
conquering
 
<EOS>
it
is
not
for
you
to
say
how
far
the
worst
of
all
exasperations
may
,
or
may
not
,
carry
the
maddened
men
of
an
enslaved
nation
.
<EOS>
The
iron
that
has
entered
into
our
souls
has
gone
too
deep
for
you
to
find
it
.
<EOS>
Leave
the
refugee
alone
!
<EOS>
Laugh
at
him
,
distrust
him
,
open
your
eyes
in
wonder
at
that
secret
self
which
smoulders
in
him
,
sometimes
under
the
everyday
respectability
and
tranquillity
of
a
man
like
me
 
sometimes
under
the
grinding
poverty
,
the
fierce
squalor
,
of
men
less
lucky
,
less
pliable
,
less
patient
than
I
am
 
but
judge
us
not
!
<EOS>
In
the
time
of
your
first
Charles
you
might
have
done
us
justice
 
the
long
luxury
of
your
own
freedom
has
made
you
incapable
of
doing
us
justice
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
All
the
deepest
feelings
of
his
nature
seemed
to
force
themselves
to
the
surface
in
those
words
 
all
his
heart
was
poured
out
to
me
for
the
first
time
in
our
lives
 
but
still
his
voice
never
rose
,
still
his
dread
of
the
terrible
revelation
he
was
making
to
me
never
left
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
far
,
"
he
resumed
,
"
you
think
the
society
like
other
societies
.
<EOS>
Its
object
(
in
your
English
opinion
)
is
anarchy
and
revolution
.
<EOS>
It
takes
the
life
of
a
bad
king
or
a
bad
minister
,
as
if
the
one
and
the
other
were
dangerous
wild
beasts
to
be
shot
at
the
first
opportunity
.
<EOS>
I
grant
you
this
.
<EOS>
But
the
laws
of
the
Brotherhood
are
the
laws
of
no
other
political
society
on
the
face
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
The
members
are
not
known
to
one
another
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
president
in
Italy
;
there
are
presidents
abroad
.
<EOS>
Each
of
these
has
his
secretary
.
<EOS>
The
presidents
and
the
secretaries
know
the
members
,
but
the
members
,
among
themselves
,
are
all
strangers
,
until
their
chiefs
see
fit
,
in
the
political
necessity
of
the
time
,
or
in
the
private
necessity
of
the
society
,
to
make
them
known
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
With
such
a
safeguard
as
this
there
is
no
oath
among
us
on
admittance
.
<EOS>
We
are
identified
with
the
Brotherhood
by
a
secret
mark
,
which
we
all
bear
,
which
lasts
while
our
lives
last
.
<EOS>
We
are
told
to
go
about
our
ordinary
business
,
and
to
report
ourselves
to
the
president
,
or
the
secretary
,
four
times
a
year
,
in
the
event
of
our
services
being
required
.
<EOS>
We
are
warned
,
if
we
betray
the
Brotherhood
,
or
if
we
injure
it
by
serving
other
interests
,
that
we
die
by
the
principles
of
the
Brotherhood
 
die
by
the
hand
of
a
stranger
who
may
be
sent
from
the
other
end
of
the
world
to
strike
the
blow
 
or
by
the
hand
of
our
own
bosom
-
friend
,
who
may
have
been
a
member
unknown
to
us
through
all
the
years
of
our
intimacy
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
the
death
is
delayed
 
<EOS>
sometimes
it
follows
close
on
the
treachery
.
<EOS>
It
is
our
first
business
to
know
how
to
wait
 
our
second
business
to
know
how
to
obey
when
the
word
is
spoken
.
<EOS>
Some
of
us
may
wait
our
lives
through
,
and
may
not
be
wanted
.
<EOS>
Some
of
us
may
be
called
to
the
work
,
or
to
the
preparation
for
the
work
,
the
very
day
of
our
admission
.
<EOS>
I
myself
 
the
little
,
easy
,
cheerful
man
you
know
,
who
,
of
his
own
accord
,
would
hardly
lift
up
his
handkerchief
to
strike
down
the
fly
that
buzzes
about
his
face
 
<EOS>
I
,
in
my
younger
time
,
under
provocation
so
dreadful
that
I
will
not
tell
you
of
it
,
entered
the
Brotherhood
by
an
impulse
,
as
I
might
have
killed
myself
by
an
impulse
.
<EOS>
I
must
remain
in
it
now
 
<EOS>
it
has
got
me
,
whatever
I
may
think
of
it
in
my
better
circumstances
and
my
cooler
manhood
,
to
my
dying
day
.
<EOS>
While
I
was
still
in
Italy
I
was
chosen
secretary
,
and
all
the
members
of
that
time
,
who
were
brought
face
to
face
with
my
president
,
were
brought
face
to
face
also
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
began
to
understand
him
 
<EOS>
I
saw
the
end
towards
which
his
extraordinary
disclosure
was
now
tending
.
<EOS>
He
waited
a
moment
,
watching
me
earnestly
 
watching
till
he
had
evidently
guessed
what
was
passing
in
my
mind
before
he
resumed
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
drawn
your
own
conclusion
already
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
in
your
face
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
nothing
 
<EOS>
keep
me
out
of
the
secret
of
your
thoughts
.
<EOS>
Let
me
make
my
one
last
sacrifice
of
myself
,
for
your
sake
,
and
then
have
done
with
this
subject
,
never
to
return
to
it
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
signed
to
me
not
to
answer
him
 
<EOS>
rose
 
<EOS>
removed
his
coat
 
and
rolled
up
the
shirt
-
sleeve
on
his
left
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
promised
you
that
this
confidence
should
be
complete
,
"
he
whispered
,
speaking
close
at
my
ear
,
with
his
eyes
looking
watchfully
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
Whatever
comes
of
it
you
shall
not
reproach
me
with
having
hidden
anything
from
you
which
it
was
necessary
to
your
interests
to
know
.
<EOS>
I
have
said
that
the
Brotherhood
identifies
its
members
by
a
mark
that
lasts
for
life
.
<EOS>
See
the
place
,
and
the
mark
on
it
for
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
raised
his
bare
arm
,
and
showed
me
,
high
on
the
upper
part
of
it
and
in
the
inner
side
,
a
brand
deeply
burnt
in
the
flesh
and
stained
of
a
bright
blood
-
red
colour
.
<EOS>
I
abstain
from
describing
the
device
which
the
brand
represented
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
sufficient
to
say
that
it
was
circular
in
form
,
and
so
small
that
it
would
have
been
completely
covered
by
a
shilling
coin
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
man
who
has
this
mark
,
branded
in
this
place
,
"
he
said
,
covering
his
arm
again
,
"
is
a
member
of
the
Brotherhood
.
<EOS>
A
man
who
has
been
false
to
the
Brotherhood
is
discovered
sooner
or
later
by
the
chiefs
who
know
him
 
presidents
or
secretaries
,
as
the
case
may
be
.
<EOS>
And
a
man
discovered
by
the
chiefs
is
dead
.
<EOS>
NO
HUMAN
LAWS
CAN
PROTECT
HIM
.
<EOS>
Remember
what
you
have
seen
and
heard
 
draw
what
conclusions
YOU
like
 
act
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
the
name
of
God
,
whatever
you
discover
,
whatever
you
do
,
tell
me
nothing
!
<EOS>
Let
me
remain
free
from
a
responsibility
which
it
horrifies
me
to
think
of
 
which
I
know
,
in
my
conscience
,
is
not
my
responsibility
now
.
<EOS>
For
the
last
time
I
say
it
 
on
my
honour
as
a
gentleman
,
on
my
oath
as
a
Christian
,
if
the
man
you
pointed
out
at
the
Opera
knows
ME
,
he
is
so
altered
,
or
so
disguised
,
that
I
do
not
know
him
.
<EOS>
I
am
ignorant
of
his
proceedings
or
his
purposes
in
England
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
him
,
I
never
heard
the
name
he
goes
by
,
to
my
knowledge
,
before
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
I
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
Leave
me
a
little
,
Walter
.
<EOS>
I
am
overpowered
by
what
has
happened
 
<EOS>
I
am
shaken
by
what
I
have
said
.
<EOS>
Let
me
try
to
be
like
myself
again
when
we
meet
next
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
dropped
into
a
chair
,
and
turning
away
from
me
,
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
.
<EOS>
I
gently
opened
the
door
so
as
not
to
disturb
him
,
and
spoke
my
few
parting
words
in
low
tones
,
which
he
might
hear
or
not
,
as
he
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
keep
the
memory
of
to
-
night
in
my
heart
of
hearts
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
never
repent
the
trust
you
have
reposed
in
me
.
<EOS>
May
I
come
to
you

morrow

<EOS>
May
I
come
as
early
as
nine
o'clock

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Walter
,
"
he
replied
,
looking
up
at
me
kindly
,
and
speaking
in
English
once
more
,
as
if
his
one
anxiety
now
was
to
get
back
to
our
former
relations
towards
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
Come
to
my
little
bit
of
breakfast
before
I
go
my
ways
among
the
pupils

<EOS>

MY
first
conviction
as
soon
as
I
found
myself
outside
the
house
,
was
that
no
alternative
was
left
me
but
to
act
at
once
on
the
information
I
had
received
 
to
make
sure
of
the
Count
that
night
,
or
to
risk
the
loss
,
if
I
only
delayed
till
the
morning
,
of
Laura
's
last
chance
.
<EOS>
I
looked
at
my
watch
 
<EOS>
it
was
ten
o'clock
.
  
<EOS>
Not
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
crossed
my
mind
of
the
purpose
for
which
the
Count
had
left
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
His
escape
from
us
,
that
evening
,
was
beyond
all
question
the
preliminary
only
to
his
escape
from
London
.
<EOS>
The
mark
of
the
Brotherhood
was
on
his
arm
 
<EOS>
I
felt
as
certain
of
it
as
if
he
had
shown
me
the
brand
;
and
the
betrayal
of
the
Brotherhood
was
on
his
conscience
 
<EOS>
I
had
seen
it
in
his
recognition
of
Pesca
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
easy
to
understand
why
that
recognition
had
not
been
mutual
.
<EOS>
A
man
of
the
Count
's
character
would
never
risk
the
terrible
consequences
of
turning
spy
without
looking
to
his
personal
security
quite
as
carefully
as
he
looked
to
his
golden
reward
.
<EOS>
The
shaven
face
,
which
I
had
pointed
out
at
the
Opera
,
might
have
been
covered
by
a
beard
in
Pesca
's
time
 
his
dark
brown
hair
might
be
a
wig
 
<EOS>
his
name
was
evidently
a
false
one
.
<EOS>
The
accident
of
time
might
have
helped
him
as
well
 
his
immense
corpulence
might
have
come
with
his
later
years
.
<EOS>
There
was
every
reason
why
Pesca
should
not
have
known
him
again
 
every
reason
also
why
he
should
have
known
Pesca
,
<EOS>
whose
singular
personal
appearance
made
a
marked
man
of
him
,
go
where
he
might
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
said
that
I
felt
certain
of
the
purpose
in
the
Count
's
mind
when
he
escaped
us
at
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
How
could
I
doubt
it
,
when
I
saw
,
with
my
own
eyes
,
that
he
believed
himself
,
in
spite
of
the
change
in
his
appearance
,
to
have
been
recognised
by
Pesca
,
and
to
be
therefore
in
danger
of
his
life
?
<EOS>
If
I
could
get
speech
of
him
that
night
,
if
I
could
show
him
that
I
,
too
knew
of
the
mortal
peril
in
which
he
stood
,
what
result
would
follow
?
<EOS>
Plainly
this
.
<EOS>
One
of
us
must
be
master
of
the
situation
 
<EOS>
one
of
us
must
inevitably
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
I
owed
it
to
myself
to
consider
the
chances
against
me
before
I
confronted
them
.
<EOS>
I
owed
it
to
my
wife
to
do
all
that
lay
in
my
power
to
lessen
the
risk
.
  
<EOS>
The
chances
against
me
wanted
no
reckoning
up
 
<EOS>
they
were
all
merged
in
one
.
<EOS>
If
the
Count
discovered
,
by
my
own
avowal
,
that
the
direct
way
to
his
safety
lay
through
my
life
,
he
was
probably
the
last
man
in
existence
who
would
shrink
from
throwing
me
off
my
guard
and
taking
that
way
,
when
he
had
me
alone
within
his
reach
.
<EOS>
The
only
means
of
defence
against
him
on
which
I
could
at
all
rely
to
lessen
the
risk
,
presented
themselves
,
after
a
little
careful
thinking
,
clearly
enough
.
<EOS>
Before
I
made
any
personal
acknowledgment
of
my
discovery
in
his
presence
,
I
must
place
the
discovery
itself
where
it
would
be
ready
for
instant
use
against
him
,
and
safe
from
any
attempt
at
suppression
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
If
I
laid
the
mine
under
his
feet
before
I
approached
him
,
and
if
I
left
instructions
with
a
third
person
to
fire
it
on
the
expiration
of
a
certain
time
,
unless
directions
to
the
contrary
were
previously
received
under
my
own
hand
,
or
from
my
own
lips
 
in
that
event
the
Count
's
security
was
absolutely
dependent
upon
mine
,
and
I
might
hold
the
vantage
ground
over
him
securely
,
even
in
his
own
house
.
  
<EOS>
This
idea
occurred
to
me
when
I
was
close
to
the
new
lodgings
which
we
had
taken
on
returning
from
the
sea
-
side
.
<EOS>
I
went
in
without
disturbing
any
one
,
by
the
help
of
my
key
.
<EOS>
A
light
was
in
the
hall
,
and
I
stole
up
with
it
to
my
workroom
to
make
my
preparations
,
and
absolutely
to
commit
myself
to
an
interview
with
the
Count
,
before
either
Laura
or
Marian
could
have
the
slightest
suspicion
of
what
I
intended
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
A
letter
addressed
to
Pesca
represented
the
surest
measure
of
precaution
which
it
was
now
possible
for
me
to
take
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
as
follows
    
"
<EOS>
The
man
whom
I
pointed
out
to
you
at
the
Opera
is
a
member
of
the
Brotherhood
,
and
has
been
false
to
his
trust
.
<EOS>
Put
both
these
assertions
to
the
test
instantly
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
name
he
goes
by
in
England
.
<EOS>
His
address
is
No
.
5
<EOS>
Forest
Road
,
<EOS>
St.
John
's
Wood
.
<EOS>
On
the
love
you
once
bore
me
,
use
the
power
entrusted
to
you
without
mercy
and
without
delay
against
that
man
.
<EOS>
I
have
risked
all
and
lost
all
 
and
the
forfeit
of
my
failure
has
been
paid
with
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
signed
and
dated
these
lines
,
enclosed
them
in
an
envelope
,
and
sealed
it
up
.
<EOS>
On
the
outside
I
wrote
this
direction
:
"
Keep
the
enclosure
unopened
until
nine
o'clock
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
not
hear
from
me
,
or
see
me
,
before
that
time
,
break
the
seal
when
the
clock
strikes
,
and
read
the
contents
.
<EOS>
"
I
added
my
initials
,
and
protected
the
whole
by
enclosing
it
in
a
second
sealed
envelope
,
addressed
to
Pesca
at
his
lodgings
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
remained
to
be
done
after
this
but
to
find
the
means
of
sending
my
letter
to
its
destination
immediately
.
<EOS>
I
should
then
have
accomplished
all
that
lay
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
If
anything
happened
to
me
in
the
Count
's
house
,
I
had
now
provided
for
his
answering
it
with
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
That
the
means
of
preventing
his
escape
,
under
any
circumstances
whatever
,
were
at
Pesca
's
disposal
,
if
he
chose
to
exert
them
,
I
did
not
for
an
instant
doubt
.
<EOS>
The
extraordinary
anxiety
which
he
had
expressed
to
remain
unenlightened
as
to
the
Count
's
identity
 
or
,
in
other
words
,
to
be
left
uncertain
enough
about
facts
to
justify
him
to
his
own
conscience
in
remaining
passive
 
betrayed
plainly
that
the
means
of
exercising
the
terrible
justice
of
the
Brotherhood
were
ready
to
his
hand
,
although
,
as
a
naturally
humane
man
,
he
had
shrunk
from
plainly
saying
as
much
in
my
presence
.
<EOS>
The
deadly
certainty
with
which
the
vengeance
of
foreign
political
societies
can
hunt
down
a
traitor
to
the
cause
,
hide
himself
where
he
may
,
had
been
too
often
exemplified
,
even
in
my
superficial
experience
,
to
allow
of
any
doubt
.
<EOS>
Considering
the
subject
only
as
a
reader
of
newspapers
,
cases
recurred
to
my
memory
,
both
in
London
and
in
Paris
,
of
foreigners
found
stabbed
in
the
streets
,
whose
assassins
could
never
be
traced
 
of
bodies
and
parts
of
bodies
thrown
into
the
Thames
and
the
Seine
,
by
hands
that
could
never
be
discovered
 
of
deaths
by
secret
violence
which
could
only
be
accounted
for
in
one
way
.
<EOS>
I
have
disguised
nothing
relating
to
myself
in
these
pages
,
and
I
do
not
disguise
here
that
I
believed
I
had
written
Count
Fosco
's
death
-
warrant
,
if
the
fatal
emergency
happened
which
authorised
Pesca
to
open
my
enclosure
.
  
<EOS>
I
left
my
room
to
go
down
to
the
ground
floor
of
the
house
,
and
speak
to
the
landlord
about
finding
me
a
messenger
.
<EOS>
He
happened
to
be
ascending
the
stairs
at
the
time
,
and
we
met
on
the
landing
.
<EOS>
His
son
,
a
quick
lad
,
was
the
messenger
he
proposed
to
me
on
hearing
what
I
wanted
.
<EOS>
We
had
the
boy
upstairs
,
and
I
gave
him
his
directions
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
take
the
letter
in
a
cab
,
to
put
it
into
Professor
Pesca
's
own
hands
,
and
to
bring
me
back
a
line
of
acknowledgment
from
that
gentleman
 
returning
in
the
cab
,
and
keeping
it
at
the
door
for
my
use
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
nearly
half
-
past
ten
.
<EOS>
I
calculated
that
the
boy
might
be
back
in
twenty
minutes
,
and
that
I
might
drive
to
St.
John
's
Wood
,
on
his
return
,
in
twenty
minutes
more
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
lad
had
departed
on
his
errand
<EOS>
I
returned
to
my
own
room
for
a
little
while
,
to
put
certain
papers
in
order
,
so
that
they
might
be
easily
found
in
case
of
the
worst
.
<EOS>
The
key
of
the
old
-
fashioned
bureau
in
which
the
papers
were
kept
I
sealed
up
,
and
left
it
on
my
table
,
with
Marian
's
name
written
on
the
outside
of
the
little
packet
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
I
went
downstairs
to
the
sitting
-
room
,
in
which
I
expected
to
find
Laura
and
Marian
awaiting
my
return
from
the
Opera
.
<EOS>
I
felt
my
hand
trembling
for
the
first
time
when
I
laid
it
on
the
lock
of
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
No
one
was
in
the
room
but
Marian
.
<EOS>
She
was
reading
,
and
she
looked
at
her
watch
,
in
surprise
,
when
I
came
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
early
you
are
back
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
come
away
before
the
Opera
was
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
I
replied
,
"
neither
Pesca
nor
I
waited
for
the
end
.
<EOS>
Where
is
Laura
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
had
one
of
her
bad
headaches
this
evening
,
and
I
advised
her
to
go
to
bed
when
we
had
done
tea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
left
the
room
again
on
the
pretext
of
wishing
to
see
whether
Laura
was
asleep
.
<EOS>
Marian
's
quick
eyes
were
beginning
to
look
inquiringly
at
my
face
 
Marian
's
quick
instinct
was
beginning
to
discover
that
I
had
something
weighing
on
my
mind
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
entered
the
bedchamber
,
and
softly
approached
the
bedside
by
the
dim
flicker
of
the
night
-
lamp
,
my
wife
was
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
not
been
married
quite
a
month
yet
.
<EOS>
If
my
heart
was
heavy
,
if
my
resolution
for
a
moment
faltered
again
,
when
I
looked
at
her
face
turned
faithfully
to
my
pillow
in
her
sleep
 
when
I
saw
her
hand
resting
open
on
the
coverlid
,
as
if
it
was
waiting
unconsciously
for
mine
 
surely
there
was
some
excuse
for
me
?
<EOS>
I
only
allowed
myself
a
few
minutes
to
kneel
down
at
the
bedside
,
and
to
look
close
at
her
 
so
close
that
her
breath
,
as
it
came
and
went
,
fluttered
on
my
face
.
<EOS>
I
only
touched
her
hand
and
her
cheek
with
my
lips
at
parting
.
<EOS>
She
stirred
in
her
sleep
and
murmured
my
name
,
but
without
waking
.
<EOS>
I
lingered
for
an
instant
at
the
door
to
look
at
her
again
.
"
<EOS>
God
bless
and
keep
you
,
my
darling
!
<EOS>
"
I
whispered
,
and
left
her
.
  
<EOS>
Marian
was
at
the
stairhead
waiting
for
me
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
folded
slip
of
paper
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
landlord
's
son
has
brought
this
for
you
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
He
has
got
a
cab
at
the
door
 
<EOS>
he
says
you
ordered
him
to
keep
it
at
your
disposal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
right
,
Marian
.
<EOS>
I
want
the
cab
 
I
am
going
out
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
descended
the
stairs
as
I
spoke
,
and
looked
into
the
sitting
-
room
to
read
the
slip
of
paper
by
the
light
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
It
contained
these
two
sentences
in
Pesca
's
handwriting
    
"
Your
letter
is
received
.
<EOS>
If
I
do
n't
see
you
before
the
time
you
mention
,
I
will
break
the
seal
when
the
clock
strikes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
placed
the
paper
in
my
pocket
-
book
,
and
made
for
the
door
.
<EOS>
Marian
met
me
on
the
threshold
,
and
pushed
me
back
into
the
room
,
where
the
candle
-
light
fell
full
on
my
face
.
<EOS>
She
held
me
by
both
hands
,
and
her
eyes
fastened
searchingly
on
mine
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
in
a
low
eager
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
trying
the
last
chance
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
the
last
chance
and
the
best
,
"
I
whispered
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
alone
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
Walter
,
for
God
's
sake
,
not
alone
!
<EOS>
Let
me
go
with
you
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
refuse
me
because
I
'm
only
a
woman
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
!
<EOS>
I
will
go
!
<EOS>
I
'll
wait
outside
in
the
cab
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
my
turn
now
to
hold
HER
.
<EOS>
She
tried
to
break
away
from
me
and
get
down
first
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
want
to
help
me
,
"
I
said
,
"
stop
here
and
sleep
in
my
wife
's
room
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Only
let
me
go
away
with
my
mind
easy
about
Laura
,
and
I
answer
for
everything
else
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Marian
,
give
me
a
kiss
,
and
show
that
you
have
the
courage
to
wait
till
I
come
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
dared
not
allow
her
time
to
say
a
word
more
.
<EOS>
She
tried
to
hold
me
again
.
<EOS>
I
unclasped
her
hands
,
and
was
out
of
the
room
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
The
boy
below
heard
me
on
the
stairs
,
and
opened
the
hall
-
door
.
<EOS>
I
jumped
into
the
cab
before
the
driver
could
get
off
the
box
.
"
<EOS>
Forest
Road
,
St.
John
's
Wood
,
"
<EOS>
I
called
to
him
through
the
front
window
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Double
fare
if
you
get
there
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
'll
do
it
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
I
looked
at
my
watch
.
<EOS>
Eleven
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Not
a
minute
to
lose
.
  
<EOS>
The
rapid
motion
of
the
cab
,
the
sense
that
every
instant
now
was
bringing
me
nearer
to
the
Count
,
the
conviction
that
I
was
embarked
at
last
,
without
let
or
hindrance
,
on
my
hazardous
enterprise
,
heated
me
into
such
a
fever
of
excitement
that
I
shouted
to
the
man
to
go
faster
and
faster
.
<EOS>
As
we
left
the
streets
,
and
crossed
St.
John
's
Wood
Road
,
my
impatience
so
completely
overpowered
me
that
I
stood
up
in
the
cab
and
stretched
my
head
out
of
the
window
,
to
see
the
end
of
the
journey
before
we
reached
it
.
<EOS>
Just
as
a
church
clock
in
the
distance
struck
the
quarter
past
,
we
turned
into
the
Forest
Road
.
<EOS>
I
stopped
the
driver
a
little
away
from
the
Count
's
house
,
paid
and
dismissed
him
,
and
walked
on
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
approached
the
garden
gate
,
I
saw
another
person
advancing
towards
it
also
from
the
direction
opposite
to
mine
.
<EOS>
We
met
under
the
gas
lamp
in
the
road
,
and
looked
at
each
other
.
<EOS>
I
instantly
recognised
the
light
-
haired
foreigner
with
the
scar
on
his
cheek
,
and
I
thought
he
recognised
me
.
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
,
and
instead
of
stopping
at
the
house
,
as
I
did
,
he
slowly
walked
on
.
<EOS>
Was
he
in
the
Forest
Road
by
accident
?
<EOS>
Or
had
he
followed
the
Count
home
from
the
Opera
?
  
<EOS>
I
did
not
pursue
those
questions
.
<EOS>
After
waiting
a
little
till
the
foreigner
had
slowly
passed
out
of
sight
,
I
rang
the
gate
bell
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
twenty
minutes
past
eleven
 
late
enough
to
make
it
quite
easy
for
the
Count
to
get
rid
of
me
by
the
excuse
that
he
was
in
bed
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
way
of
providing
against
this
contingency
was
to
send
in
my
name
without
asking
any
preliminary
questions
,
and
to
let
him
know
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
I
had
a
serious
motive
for
wishing
to
see
him
at
that
late
hour
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
while
I
was
waiting
,
I
took
out
my
card
and
wrote
under
my
name
"
On
important
business
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
maid
-
servant
answered
the
door
while
I
was
writing
the
last
word
in
pencil
,
and
asked
me
distrustfully
what
I
"
pleased
to
want
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Be
so
good
as
to
take
that
to
your
master
,
"
I
replied
,
giving
her
the
card
.
  
<EOS>
I
saw
,
by
the
girl
's
hesitation
of
manner
,
that
if
I
had
asked
for
the
Count
in
the
first
instance
she
would
only
have
followed
her
instructions
by
telling
me
he
was
not
at
home
.
<EOS>
She
was
staggered
by
the
confidence
with
which
I
gave
her
the
card
.
<EOS>
After
staring
at
me
,
in
great
perturbation
,
she
went
back
into
the
house
with
my
message
,
closing
the
door
,
and
leaving
me
to
wait
in
the
garden
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
minute
<EOS>
or
so
she
reappeared
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
master
's
compliments
,
and
would
I
be
so
obliging
as
to
say
what
my
business
was
?
"
<EOS>
"
Take
my
compliments
back
,
"
I
replied
,
"
and
say
that
the
business
can
not
be
mentioned
to
any
one
but
your
master
.
"
<EOS>
She
left
me
again
,
again
returned
,
and
this
time
asked
me
to
walk
in
.
  
<EOS>
I
followed
her
at
once
.
<EOS>
In
another
moment
I
was
inside
the
Count
's
house
.
    
<EOS>
There
was
no
lamp
in
the
hall
,
but
by
the
dim
light
of
the
kitchen
candle
,
which
the
girl
had
brought
upstairs
with
her
,
I
saw
an
elderly
lady
steal
noiselessly
out
of
a
back
room
on
the
ground
floor
.
<EOS>
She
cast
one
viperish
look
at
me
as
I
entered
the
hall
,
but
said
nothing
,
and
went
slowly
upstairs
without
returning
my
bow
.
<EOS>
My
familiarity
with
Marian
's
journal
sufficiently
assured
me
that
the
elderly
lady
was
Madame
Fosco
.
  
<EOS>
The
servant
led
me
to
the
room
which
the
Countess
had
just
left
.
<EOS>
I
entered
it
,
and
found
myself
face
to
face
with
the
Count
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
still
in
his
evening
dress
,
except
his
coat
,
which
he
had
thrown
across
a
chair
.
<EOS>
His
shirt
-
sleeves
were
turned
up
at
the
wrists
,
but
no
higher
.
<EOS>
A
carpet
-
bag
was
on
one
side
of
him
,
and
a
box
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
Books
,
papers
,
and
articles
of
wearing
apparel
were
scattered
about
the
room
.
<EOS>
On
a
table
,
at
one
side
of
the
door
,
stood
the
cage
,
so
well
known
to
me
by
description
,
which
contained
his
white
mice
.
<EOS>
The
canaries
and
the
cockatoo
were
probably
in
some
other
room
.
<EOS>
He
was
seated
before
the
box
,
packing
it
,
when
I
went
in
,
and
rose
with
some
papers
in
his
hand
to
receive
me
.
<EOS>
His
face
still
betrayed
plain
traces
of
the
shock
that
had
overwhelmed
him
at
the
Opera
.
<EOS>
His
fat
cheeks
hung
loose
,
his
cold
grey
eyes
were
furtively
vigilant
,
his
voice
,
look
,
and
manner
were
all
sharply
suspicious
alike
,
as
he
advanced
a
step
to
meet
me
,
and
requested
,
with
distant
civility
,
that
I
would
take
a
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
come
here
on
business
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
at
a
loss
to
know
what
that
business
can
possibly
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
unconcealed
curiosity
,
with
which
he
looked
hard
in
my
face
while
he
spoke
,
convinced
me
that
I
had
passed
unnoticed
by
him
at
the
Opera
.
<EOS>
He
had
seen
Pesca
first
,
and
from
that
moment
till
he
left
the
theatre
he
had
evidently
seen
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
My
name
would
necessarily
suggest
to
him
that
I
had
not
come
into
his
house
with
other
than
a
hostile
purpose
towards
himself
,
but
he
appeared
to
be
utterly
ignorant
thus
far
of
the
real
nature
of
my
errand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
fortunate
in
finding
you
here
to
-
night
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
be
on
the
point
of
taking
a
journey
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
your
business
connected
with
my
journey
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
some
degree
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
In
what
degree
?
<EOS>
Do
you
know
where
I
am
going
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
I
only
know
why
you
are
leaving
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
slipped
by
me
with
the
quickness
of
thought
,
locked
the
door
,
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
and
I
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
are
excellently
well
acquainted
with
one
another
by
reputation
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Did
it
,
by
any
chance
,
occur
to
you
when
you
came
to
this
house
that
I
was
not
the
sort
of
man
you
could
trifle
with
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
did
occur
to
me
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
have
not
come
to
trifle
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
here
on
a
matter
of
life
and
death
,
and
if
that
door
which
you
have
locked
was
open
at
this
moment
,
nothing
you
could
say
or
do
would
induce
me
to
pass
through
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
walked
farther
into
the
room
,
and
stood
opposite
to
him
on
the
rug
before
the
fireplace
.
<EOS>
He
drew
a
chair
in
front
of
the
door
,
and
sat
down
on
it
,
with
his
left
arm
resting
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
The
cage
with
the
white
mice
was
close
to
him
,
and
the
little
creatures
scampered
out
of
their
sleeping
-
place
as
his
heavy
arm
shook
the
table
,
and
peered
at
him
through
the
gaps
in
the
smartly
painted
wires
.
  
<EOS>
"
On
a
matter
of
life
and
death
,
"
he
repeated
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
Those
words
are
more
serious
,
perhaps
,
than
you
think
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
perspiration
broke
out
thickly
on
his
broad
forehead
.
<EOS>
His
left
hand
stole
over
the
edge
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
drawer
in
it
,
with
a
lock
,
and
the
key
was
in
the
lock
.
<EOS>
His
finger
and
thumb
closed
over
the
key
,
but
did
not
turn
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
you
know
why
I
am
leaving
London
?
<EOS>
"
he
went
on
.
"
<EOS>
Tell
me
the
reason
,
if
you
please
.
"
<EOS>
He
turned
the
key
,
and
unlocked
the
drawer
as
he
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
do
better
than
that
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
SHOW
you
the
reason
,
if
you
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
show
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
got
your
coat
off
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Roll
up
the
shirt
-
sleeve
on
your
left
arm
,
and
you
will
see
it
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
same
livid
leaden
change
passed
over
his
face
which
I
had
seen
pass
over
it
at
the
theatre
.
<EOS>
The
deadly
glitter
in
his
eyes
shone
steady
and
straight
into
mine
.
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
his
left
hand
slowly
opened
the
table
-
drawer
,
and
softly
slipped
into
it
.
<EOS>
The
harsh
grating
noise
of
something
heavy
that
he
was
moving
unseen
to
me
sounded
for
a
moment
,
then
ceased
.
<EOS>
The
silence
that
followed
was
so
intense
that
the
faint
ticking
nibble
of
the
white
mice
at
their
wires
was
distinctly
audible
where
I
stood
.
  
<EOS>
My
life
hung
by
a
thread
,
and
I
knew
it
.
<EOS>
At
that
final
moment
I
thought
with
HIS
mind
,
I
felt
with
HIS
fingers
 
<EOS>
I
was
as
certain
as
if
I
had
seen
it
of
what
he
kept
hidden
from
me
in
the
drawer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wait
a
little
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
got
the
door
locked
 
<EOS>
you
see
I
do
n't
move
 
<EOS>
you
see
my
hands
are
empty
.
<EOS>
Wait
a
little
.
<EOS>
I
have
something
more
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
have
said
enough
,
"
he
replied
,
with
a
sudden
composure
so
unnatural
and
so
ghastly
that
it
tried
my
nerves
as
no
outbreak
of
violence
could
have
tried
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
one
moment
for
my
own
thoughts
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
Do
you
guess
what
I
am
thinking
about
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
thinking
,
"
he
remarked
quietly
,
"
whether
I
shall
add
to
the
disorder
in
this
room
by
scattering
your
brains
about
the
fireplace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
I
had
moved
at
that
moment
,
I
saw
in
his
face
that
he
would
have
done
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
advise
you
to
read
two
lines
of
writing
which
I
have
about
me
,
"
I
rejoined
,
"
before
you
finally
decide
that
question
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
proposal
appeared
to
excite
his
curiosity
.
<EOS>
He
nodded
his
head
.
<EOS>
I
took
Pesca
's
acknowledgment
of
the
receipt
of
my
letter
out
of
my
pocket
-
book
,
handed
it
to
him
at
arm
's
length
,
and
returned
to
my
former
position
in
front
of
the
fireplace
.
  
<EOS>
He
read
the
lines
aloud
:
"
Your
letter
is
received
.
<EOS>
If
I
do
n't
hear
from
you
before
the
time
you
mention
,
I
will
break
the
seal
when
the
clock
strikes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Another
man
in
his
position
would
have
needed
some
explanation
of
those
words
 
the
Count
felt
no
such
necessity
.
<EOS>
One
reading
of
the
note
showed
him
the
precaution
that
I
had
taken
as
plainly
as
if
he
had
been
present
at
the
time
when
I
adopted
it
.
<EOS>
The
expression
of
his
face
changed
on
the
instant
,
and
his
hand
came
out
of
the
drawer
empty
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
lock
up
my
drawer
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
I
do
n't
say
that
I
may
not
scatter
your
brains
about
the
fireplace
yet
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
a
just
man
even
to
my
enemy
,
and
I
will
acknowledge
beforehand
that
they
are
cleverer
brains
than
I
thought
them
.
<EOS>
Come
to
the
point
,
sir
!
<EOS>
You
want
something
of
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
and
I
mean
to
have
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
conditions
?
"
  
"
On
no
conditions
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
hand
dropped
into
the
drawer
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
<EOS>
we
are
travelling
in
a
circle
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
those
clever
brains
of
yours
are
in
danger
again
.
<EOS>
Your
tone
is
deplorably
imprudent
,
sir
 
moderate
it
on
the
spot
!
<EOS>
The
risk
of
shooting
you
on
the
place
where
you
stand
is
less
to
me
than
the
risk
of
letting
you
out
of
this
house
,
except
on
conditions
that
I
dictate
and
approve
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
got
my
lamented
friend
to
deal
with
now
 
<EOS>
you
are
face
to
face
with
Fosco
!
<EOS>
If
the
lives
of
twenty
Mr.
Hartrights
were
the
stepping
-
stones
to
my
safety
,
over
all
those
stones
I
would
go
,
sustained
by
my
sublime
indifference
,
self
-
balanced
by
my
impenetrable
calm
.
<EOS>
Respect
me
,
if
you
love
your
own
life
!
<EOS>
I
summon
you
to
answer
three
questions
before
you
open
your
lips
again
.
<EOS>
Hear
them
 
<EOS>
they
are
necessary
to
this
interview
.
<EOS>
Answer
them
 
they
are
necessary
to
ME
.
"
<EOS>
He
held
up
one
finger
of
his
right
hand
.
"
<EOS>
First
question
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
come
here
possessed
of
information
which
may
be
true
or
may
be
false
 
<EOS>
where
did
you
get
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
decline
to
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
matter
 
I
shall
find
out
.
<EOS>
If
that
information
is
true
 
mind
<EOS>
I
say
,
with
the
whole
force
of
my
resolution
,
if
 
you
are
making
your
market
of
it
here
by
treachery
of
your
own
or
by
treachery
of
some
other
man
.
<EOS>
I
note
that
circumstance
for
future
use
in
my
memory
,
which
forgets
nothing
,
and
proceed
.
"
<EOS>
He
held
up
another
finger
.
"
<EOS>
Second
question
!
<EOS>
Those
lines
you
invited
me
to
read
are
without
signature
.
<EOS>
Who
wrote
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
man
whom
I
have
every
reason
to
depend
on
,
and
whom
you
have
every
reason
to
fear
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
answer
reached
him
to
some
purpose
.
<EOS>
His
left
hand
trembled
audibly
in
the
drawer
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
do
you
give
me
,
"
he
asked
,
putting
his
third
question
in
a
quieter
tone
,
"
before
the
clock
strikes
and
the
seal
is
broken
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Time
enough
for
you
to
come
to
my
terms
,
"
I
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
me
a
plainer
answer
,
Mr.
Hartright
.
<EOS>
What
hour
is
the
clock
to
strike
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nine
,
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nine
,
to
-
morrow
morning
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
 
your
trap
is
laid
for
me
before
I
can
get
my
passport
regulated
and
leave
London
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
earlier
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
We
will
see
about
that
presently
 
<EOS>
I
can
keep
you
hostage
here
,
and
bargain
with
you
to
send
for
your
letter
before
I
let
you
go
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
be
so
good
next
as
to
mention
your
terms
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
hear
them
.
<EOS>
They
are
simple
,
and
soon
stated
.
<EOS>
You
know
whose
interests
I
represent
in
coming
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
smiled
with
the
most
supreme
composure
,
and
carelessly
waved
his
right
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
consent
to
hazard
a
guess
,
"
he
said
jeeringly
.
<EOS>
"
A
lady
's
interests
,
of
course
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
Wife
's
interests
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
me
with
the
first
honest
expression
that
had
crossed
his
face
in
my
presence
 
an
expression
of
blank
amazement
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
that
I
sank
in
his
estimation
as
a
dangerous
man
from
that
moment
.
<EOS>
He
shut
up
the
drawer
at
once
,
folded
his
arms
over
his
breast
,
and
listened
to
me
with
a
smile
of
satirical
attention
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
well
enough
aware
,
"
I
went
on
,
"
of
the
course
which
my
inquiries
have
taken
for
many
months
past
,
to
know
that
any
attempted
denial
of
plain
facts
will
be
quite
useless
in
my
presence
.
<EOS>
You
are
guilty
of
an
infamous
conspiracy
!
<EOS>
And
the
gain
of
a
fortune
of
ten
thousand
pounds
was
your
motive
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
his
face
became
overclouded
suddenly
by
a
lowering
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
your
gain
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
(
His
face
lightened
again
immediately
,
and
his
eyes
opened
on
me
in
wider
and
wider
astonishment
.
)
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
here
to
disgrace
myself
by
bargaining
for
money
which
has
passed
through
your
hands
,
and
which
has
been
the
price
of
a
vile
crime
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gently
,
Mr.
Hartright
.
<EOS>
Your
moral
clap
-
traps
have
an
excellent
effect
in
England
 
keep
them
for
yourself
and
your
own
countrymen
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
The
ten
thousand
pounds
was
a
legacy
left
to
my
excellent
wife
by
the
late
Mr.
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
Place
the
affair
on
those
grounds
,
and
I
will
discuss
it
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
To
a
man
of
my
sentiments
,
however
,
the
subject
is
deplorably
sordid
.
<EOS>
I
prefer
to
pass
it
over
.
<EOS>
I
invite
you
to
resume
the
discussion
of
your
terms
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
demand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
first
place
,
I
demand
a
full
confession
of
the
conspiracy
,
written
and
signed
in
my
presence
by
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
raised
his
finger
again
.
<EOS>
"
One
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
checking
me
off
with
the
steady
attention
of
a
practical
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
second
place
,
I
demand
a
plain
proof
,
which
does
not
depend
on
your
personal
asseveration
,
of
the
date
at
which
my
wife
left
Blackwater
Park
and
travelled
to
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
So
!
<EOS>
so
!
<EOS>
you
can
lay
your
finger
,
I
see
,
on
the
weak
place
,
"
he
remarked
composedly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Any
more
?
"
  
"
At
present
,
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
!
<EOS>
you
have
mentioned
your
terms
,
now
listen
to
mine
.
<EOS>
The
responsibility
to
myself
of
admitting
what
you
are
pleased
to
call
the
"
conspiracy
"
is
less
,
perhaps
,
upon
the
whole
,
than
the
responsibility
of
laying
you
dead
on
that
hearthrug
.
<EOS>
Let
us
say
that
I
meet
your
proposal
 
on
my
own
conditions
.
<EOS>
The
statement
you
demand
of
me
shall
be
written
,
and
the
plain
proof
shall
be
produced
.
<EOS>
You
call
a
letter
from
my
late
lamented
friend
informing
me
of
the
day
and
hour
of
his
wife
's
arrival
in
London
,
written
,
signed
,
and
dated
by
himself
,
a
proof
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
I
can
give
you
this
.
<EOS>
I
can
also
send
you
to
the
man
of
whom
I
hired
the
carriage
to
fetch
my
visitor
from
the
railway
,
on
the
day
when
she
arrived
 
his
order
-
book
may
help
you
to
your
date
,
even
if
his
coachman
who
drove
me
proves
to
be
of
no
use
.
<EOS>
These
things
I
can
do
,
and
will
do
,
on
conditions
.
<EOS>
I
recite
them
.
<EOS>
First
condition
!
<EOS>
Madame
Fosco
<EOS>
and
I
leave
this
house
when
and
how
we
please
,
without
interference
of
any
kind
on
your
part
.
<EOS>
Second
condition
!
<EOS>
You
wait
here
,
in
company
with
me
,
to
see
my
agent
,
who
is
coming
at
seven
o'clock
in
the
morning
to
regulate
my
affairs
.
<EOS>
You
give
my
agent
a
written
order
to
the
man
who
has
got
your
sealed
letter
to
resign
his
possession
of
it
.
<EOS>
You
wait
here
till
my
agent
places
that
letter
unopened
in
my
hands
,
and
you
then
allow
me
one
clear
half
-
hour
to
leave
the
house
 
after
which
you
resume
your
own
freedom
of
action
and
go
where
you
please
.
<EOS>
Third
condition
!
<EOS>
You
give
me
the
satisfaction
of
a
gentleman
for
your
intrusion
into
my
private
affairs
,
and
for
the
language
you
have
allowed
yourself
to
use
to
me
at
this
conference
.
<EOS>
The
time
and
place
,
abroad
,
to
be
fixed
in
a
letter
from
my
hand
when
I
am
safe
on
the
Continent
,
and
that
letter
to
contain
a
strip
of
paper
measuring
accurately
the
length
of
my
sword
.
<EOS>
Those
are
my
terms
.
<EOS>
Inform
me
if
you
accept
them
 
<EOS>
Yes
or
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
extraordinary
mixture
of
prompt
decision
,
far
-
sighted
cunning
,
and
mountebank
bravado
in
this
speech
,
staggered
me
for
a
moment
 
and
only
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
The
one
question
to
consider
was
,
whether
I
was
justified
or
not
in
possessing
myself
of
the
means
of
establishing
Laura
's
identity
at
the
cost
of
allowing
the
scoundrel
who
had
robbed
her
of
it
to
escape
me
with
impunity
.
<EOS>
I
knew
that
the
motive
of
securing
the
just
recognition
of
my
wife
in
the
birthplace
from
which
she
had
been
driven
out
as
an
impostor
,
and
of
publicly
erasing
the
lie
that
still
profaned
her
mother
's
tombstone
,
was
far
purer
,
in
its
freedom
from
all
taint
of
evil
passion
,
than
the
vindictive
motive
which
had
mingled
itself
with
my
purpose
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
And
yet
I
can
not
honestly
say
that
my
own
moral
convictions
were
strong
enough
to
decide
the
struggle
in
me
by
themselves
.
<EOS>
They
were
helped
by
my
remembrance
of
Sir
Percival
's
death
.
<EOS>
How
awfully
,
at
the
last
moment
,
had
the
working
of
the
retribution
THERE
been
snatched
from
my
feeble
hands
!
<EOS>
What
right
had
I
to
decide
,
in
my
poor
mortal
ignorance
of
the
future
,
that
this
man
,
too
,
must
escape
with
impunity
because
he
escaped
ME
?
<EOS>
I
thought
of
these
things
 
perhaps
with
the
superstition
inherent
in
my
nature
,
perhaps
with
a
sense
worthier
of
me
than
superstition
.
<EOS>
It
was
hard
,
when
I
had
fastened
my
hold
on
him
at
last
,
to
loosen
it
again
of
my
own
accord
 
<EOS>
but
I
forced
myself
to
make
the
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
In
plainer
words
,
I
determined
to
be
guided
by
the
one
higher
motive
of
which
I
was
certain
,
the
motive
of
serving
the
cause
of
Laura
and
the
cause
of
Truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
accept
your
conditions
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
With
one
reservation
on
my
part
.
"
  
"
What
reservation
may
that
be
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
refers
to
the
sealed
letter
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
require
you
to
destroy
it
unopened
in
my
presence
as
soon
as
it
is
placed
in
your
hands
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
object
in
making
this
stipulation
was
simply
to
prevent
him
from
carrying
away
written
evidence
of
the
nature
of
my
communication
with
Pesca
.
<EOS>
The
fact
of
my
communication
he
would
necessarily
discover
,
when
I
gave
the
address
to
his
agent
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
make
no
use
of
it
on
his
own
unsupported
testimony
 
even
if
he
really
ventured
to
try
the
experiment
 
which
need
excite
in
me
the
slightest
apprehension
on
Pesca
's
account
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
grant
your
reservation
,
"
he
replied
,
after
considering
the
question
gravely
for
a
minute
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
worth
dispute
 
the
letter
shall
be
destroyed
when
it
comes
into
my
hands
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
rose
,
as
he
spoke
,
from
the
chair
in
which
he
had
been
sitting
opposite
to
me
up
to
this
time
.
<EOS>
With
one
effort
he
appeared
to
free
his
mind
from
the
whole
pressure
on
it
of
the
interview
between
us
thus
far
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ouf
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
stretching
his
arms
luxuriously
,
"
the
skirmish
was
hot
while
it
lasted
.
<EOS>
Take
a
seat
,
Mr.
Hartright
.
<EOS>
We
meet
as
mortal
enemies
hereafter
 
<EOS>
let
us
,
like
gallant
gentlemen
,
exchange
polite
attentions
in
the
meantime
.
<EOS>
Permit
me
to
take
the
liberty
of
calling
for
my
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
unlocked
and
opened
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
Eleanor
!
"
<EOS>
he
called
out
in
his
deep
voice
.
<EOS>
The
lady
of
the
viperish
face
came
in
"
Madame
Fosco
 
Mr.
Hartright
,
"
said
the
Count
,
introducing
us
with
easy
dignity
.
<EOS>
"
My
angel
,
"
he
went
on
,
addressing
his
wife
,
"
will
your
labours
of
packing
up
allow
you
time
to
make
me
some
nice
strong
coffee
?
<EOS>
I
have
writing
business
to
transact
with
Mr.
Hartright
 
<EOS>
and
I
require
the
full
possession
of
my
intelligence
to
do
justice
to
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Madame
Fosco
bowed
her
head
twice
 
once
sternly
to
me
,
once
submissively
to
her
husband
,
and
glided
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
Count
walked
to
a
writing
-
table
near
the
window
,
opened
his
desk
,
and
took
from
it
several
quires
of
paper
and
a
bundle
of
quill
pens
.
<EOS>
He
scattered
the
pens
about
the
table
,
so
that
they
might
lie
ready
in
all
directions
to
be
taken
up
when
wanted
,
and
then
cut
the
paper
into
a
heap
of
narrow
slips
,
of
the
form
used
by
professional
writers
for
the
press
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
make
this
a
remarkable
document
,
"
he
said
,
looking
at
me
over
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
Habits
of
literary
composition
are
perfectly
familiar
to
me
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
rarest
of
all
the
intellectual
accomplishments
that
a
man
can
possess
is
the
grand
faculty
of
arranging
his
ideas
.
<EOS>
Immense
privilege
!
<EOS>
I
possess
it
.
<EOS>
Do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
marched
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
room
,
until
the
coffee
appeared
,
humming
to
himself
,
and
marking
the
places
at
which
obstacles
occurred
in
the
arrangement
of
his
ideas
,
by
striking
his
forehead
from
time
to
time
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
.
<EOS>
The
enormous
audacity
with
which
he
seized
on
the
situation
in
which
I
placed
him
,
and
made
it
the
pedestal
on
which
his
vanity
mounted
for
the
one
cherished
purpose
of
self
-
display
,
mastered
my
astonishment
by
main
force
.
<EOS>
Sincerely
as
I
loathed
the
man
,
the
prodigious
strength
of
his
character
,
even
in
its
most
trivial
aspects
,
impressed
me
in
spite
of
myself
.
  
<EOS>
The
coffee
was
brought
in
by
Madame
Fosco
.
<EOS>
He
kissed
her
hand
in
grateful
acknowledgment
,
and
escorted
her
to
the
door
;
returned
,
poured
out
a
cup
of
coffee
for
himself
,
and
took
it
to
the
writing
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
offer
you
some
coffee
,
Mr.
Hartright
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
before
he
sat
down
.
  
<EOS>
I
declined
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
you
think
I
shall
poison
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
gaily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
English
intellect
is
sound
,
so
far
as
it
goes
,
"
he
continued
,
seating
himself
at
the
table
;
"
but
it
has
one
grave
defect
 
<EOS>
it
is
always
cautious
in
the
wrong
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
dipped
his
pen
in
the
ink
,
placed
the
first
slip
of
paper
before
him
with
a
thump
of
his
hand
on
the
desk
,
cleared
his
throat
,
and
began
.
<EOS>
He
wrote
with
great
noise
and
rapidity
,
in
so
large
and
bold
a
hand
,
and
with
such
wide
spaces
between
the
lines
,
that
he
reached
the
bottom
of
the
slip
in
not
more
than
two
minutes
certainly
from
the
time
when
he
started
at
the
top
.
<EOS>
Each
slip
as
he
finished
it
was
paged
,
and
tossed
over
his
shoulder
out
of
his
way
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
When
his
first
pen
was
worn
out
,
THAT
went
over
his
shoulder
too
,
and
he
pounced
on
a
second
from
the
supply
scattered
about
the
table
.
<EOS>
Slip
after
slip
,
by
dozens
,
by
fifties
,
by
hundreds
,
flew
over
his
shoulders
on
either
side
of
him
till
he
had
snowed
himself
up
in
paper
all
round
his
chair
.
<EOS>
Hour
after
hour
passed
 
and
there
I
sat
watching
,
there
he
sat
writing
.
<EOS>
He
never
stopped
,
except
to
sip
his
coffee
,
and
when
that
was
exhausted
,
to
smack
his
forehead
from
time
to
time
.
<EOS>
One
o'clock
struck
,
two
,
three
,
four
 
and
still
the
slips
flew
about
all
round
him
;
still
the
untiring
pen
scraped
its
way
ceaselessly
from
top
to
bottom
of
the
page
,
still
the
white
chaos
of
paper
rose
higher
and
higher
all
round
his
chair
.
<EOS>
At
four
o'clock
I
heard
a
sudden
splutter
of
the
pen
,
indicative
of
the
flourish
with
which
he
signed
his
name
.
<EOS>
"
Bravo
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
springing
to
his
feet
with
the
activity
of
a
young
man
,
and
looking
me
straight
in
the
face
with
a
smile
of
superb
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
"
Done
,
Mr.
Hartright
!
"
<EOS>
he
announced
with
a
self
-
renovating
thump
of
his
fist
on
his
broad
breast
.
<EOS>
"
Done
,
to
my
own
profound
satisfaction
 
to
YOUR
profound
astonishment
,
when
you
read
what
I
have
written
.
<EOS>
The
subject
is
exhausted
:
the
man
 
Fosco
 
is
not
.
<EOS>
I
proceed
to
the
arrangement
of
my
slips
 
to
the
revision
of
my
slips
 
to
the
reading
of
my
slips
 
addressed
emphatically
to
your
private
ear
.
<EOS>
Four
o'clock
has
just
struck
.
<EOS>
Good
!
<EOS>
Arrangement
,
revision
,
reading
,
from
four
to
five
.
<EOS>
Short
snooze
of
restoration
for
myself
from
five
to
six
.
<EOS>
Final
preparations
from
six
to
seven
.
<EOS>
Affair
of
agent
and
sealed
letter
from
seven
to
eight
.
<EOS>
At
eight
,
en
route
.
<EOS>
Behold
the
programme
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
sat
down
cross
-
legged
on
the
floor
among
his
papers
,
strung
them
together
with
a
bodkin
and
a
piece
of
string
 
<EOS>
revised
them
,
wrote
all
the
titles
and
honours
by
which
he
was
personally
distinguished
at
the
head
of
the
first
page
,
and
then
read
the
manuscript
to
me
with
loud
theatrical
emphasis
and
profuse
theatrical
gesticulation
.
<EOS>
The
reader
will
have
an
opportunity
,
ere
long
,
of
forming
his
own
opinion
of
the
document
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
sufficient
to
mention
here
that
it
answered
my
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
He
next
wrote
me
the
address
of
the
person
from
whom
he
had
hired
the
fly
,
and
handed
me
Sir
Percival
's
letter
.
<EOS>
It
was
dated
from
Hampshire
on
the
25th
of
July
,
and
it
announced
the
journey
of
"
Lady
Glyde
"
to
London
on
the
26th
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
on
the
very
day
(
the
25th
)
when
the
doctor
's
certificate
declared
that
she
had
died
in
St.
John
's
Wood
,
she
was
alive
,
by
Sir
Percival
's
own
showing
,
at
Blackwater
 
and
,
on
the
day
after
,
she
was
to
take
a
journey
!
<EOS>
When
the
proof
of
that
journey
was
obtained
from
the
flyman
,
the
evidence
would
be
complete
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
quarter
-
past
five
,
"
said
the
Count
,
looking
at
his
watch
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Time
for
my
restorative
snooze
.
<EOS>
I
personally
resemble
Napoleon
the
Great
,
as
you
may
have
remarked
,
Mr.
Hartright
 
<EOS>
I
also
resemble
that
immortal
man
in
my
power
of
commanding
sleep
at
will
.
<EOS>
Excuse
me
one
moment
.
<EOS>
I
will
summon
Madame
Fosco
,
to
keep
you
from
feeling
dull
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Knowing
as
well
as
he
did
,
that
he
was
summoning
Madame
Fosco
to
ensure
my
not
leaving
the
house
while
he
was
asleep
,
I
made
no
reply
,
and
occupied
myself
in
tying
up
the
papers
which
he
had
placed
in
my
possession
.
  
<EOS>
The
lady
came
in
,
cool
,
pale
,
and
venomous
as
ever
.
"
<EOS>
Amuse
Mr.
Hartright
,
my
angel
,
"
said
the
Count
.
<EOS>
He
placed
a
chair
for
her
,
kissed
her
hand
for
the
second
time
,
withdrew
to
a
sofa
,
and
,
in
three
minutes
,
was
as
peacefully
and
happily
asleep
as
the
most
virtuous
man
in
existence
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Fosco
took
a
book
from
the
table
,
sat
down
,
and
looked
at
me
,
with
the
steady
vindictive
malice
of
a
woman
who
never
forgot
and
never
forgave
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
listening
to
your
conversation
with
my
husband
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
been
in
HIS
place
 
I
would
have
laid
you
dead
on
the
hearthrug
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
those
words
she
opened
her
book
,
and
never
looked
at
me
or
spoke
to
me
from
that
time
till
the
time
when
her
husband
woke
.
  
<EOS>
He
opened
his
eyes
and
rose
from
the
sofa
,
accurately
to
an
hour
from
the
time
when
he
had
gone
to
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
infinitely
refreshed
,
"
he
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
Eleanor
,
my
good
wife
,
are
you
all
ready
upstairs
?
<EOS>
That
is
well
.
<EOS>
My
little
packing
here
can
be
completed
in
ten
minutes
 
my
travelling
-
dress
assumed
in
ten
minutes
more
.
<EOS>
What
remains
before
the
agent
comes
?
"
<EOS>
He
looked
about
the
room
,
and
noticed
the
cage
with
his
white
mice
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
piteously
,
"
a
last
laceration
of
my
sympathies
still
remains
.
<EOS>
My
innocent
pets
!
<EOS>
my
little
cherished
children
!
<EOS>
what
am
I
to
do
with
them
?
<EOS>
For
the
present
we
are
settled
nowhere
;
for
the
present
we
travel
incessantly
 
the
less
baggage
we
carry
the
better
for
ourselves
.
<EOS>
My
cockatoo
,
my
canaries
,
and
my
little
mice
 
who
will
cherish
them
when
their
good
Papa
is
gone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
walked
about
the
room
deep
in
thought
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
at
all
troubled
about
writing
his
confession
,
but
he
was
visibly
perplexed
and
distressed
about
the
far
more
important
question
of
the
disposal
of
his
pets
.
<EOS>
After
long
consideration
he
suddenly
sat
down
again
at
the
writing
-
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
An
idea
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
offer
my
canaries
and
my
cockatoo
to
this
vast
Metropolis
 
my
agent
shall
present
them
in
my
name
to
the
Zoological
Gardens
of
London
.
<EOS>
The
Document
that
describes
them
shall
be
drawn
out
on
the
spot
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
began
to
write
,
repeating
the
words
as
they
flowed
from
his
pen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Number
one
.
<EOS>
Cockatoo
of
transcendent
plumage
:
attraction
,
of
himself
,
to
all
visitors
of
taste
.
<EOS>
Number
two
.
<EOS>
Canaries
of
unrivalled
vivacity
and
intelligence
:
worthy
of
the
garden
of
Eden
,
worthy
also
of
the
garden
in
the
Regent
's
Park
.
<EOS>
Homage
to
British
Zoology
.
<EOS>
Offered
by
Fosco
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
pen
spluttered
again
,
and
the
flourish
was
attached
to
his
signature
.
  
<EOS>
"
Count
!
<EOS>
you
have
not
included
the
mice
,
"
said
Madame
Fosco
  
<EOS>
He
left
the
table
,
took
her
hand
,
and
placed
it
on
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
human
resolution
,
Eleanor
,
"
he
said
solemnly
,
"
has
its
limits
.
<EOS>
MY
limits
are
inscribed
on
that
Document
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
part
with
my
white
mice
.
<EOS>
Bear
with
me
,
my
angel
,
and
remove
them
to
their
travelling
cage
upstairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Admirable
tenderness
!
"
said
Madame
Fosco
,
admiring
her
husband
,
with
a
last
viperish
look
in
my
direction
.
<EOS>
She
took
up
the
cage
carefully
,
and
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
Count
looked
at
his
watch
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
his
resolute
assumption
of
composure
,
he
was
getting
anxious
for
the
agent
's
arrival
.
<EOS>
The
candles
had
long
since
been
extinguished
,
and
the
sunlight
of
the
new
morning
poured
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
five
minutes
past
seven
that
the
gate
bell
rang
,
and
the
agent
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
foreigner
with
a
dark
beard
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Hartright
 
Monsieur
Rubelle
,
"
said
the
Count
,
introducing
us
.
<EOS>
He
took
the
agent
(
a
foreign
spy
,
in
every
line
of
his
face
,
if
ever
there
was
one
yet
)
into
a
corner
of
the
room
,
whispered
some
directions
to
him
,
and
then
left
us
together
.
"
<EOS>
Monsieur
Rubelle
,
"
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
,
suggested
with
great
politeness
that
I
should
favour
him
with
his
instructions
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
two
lines
to
Pesca
,
authorising
him
to
deliver
my
sealed
letter
"
to
the
bearer
,
"
directed
the
note
,
and
handed
it
to
Monsieur
Rubelle
.
  
<EOS>
The
agent
waited
with
me
till
his
employer
returned
,
equipped
in
travelling
costume
.
<EOS>
The
Count
examined
the
address
of
my
letter
before
he
dismissed
the
agent
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
so
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
turning
on
me
with
a
dark
look
,
and
altering
again
in
his
manner
from
that
moment
.
  
<EOS>
He
completed
his
packing
,
and
then
sat
consulting
a
travelling
map
,
making
entries
in
his
pocket
-
book
,
and
looking
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
impatiently
at
his
watch
.
<EOS>
Not
another
word
,
addressed
to
myself
,
passed
his
lips
.
<EOS>
The
near
approach
of
the
hour
for
his
departure
,
and
the
proof
he
had
seen
of
the
communication
established
between
Pesca
and
myself
,
had
plainly
recalled
his
whole
attention
to
the
measures
that
were
necessary
for
securing
his
escape
.
  
<EOS>
A
little
before
eight
o'clock
,
Monsieur
Rubelle
came
back
with
my
unopened
letter
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
The
Count
looked
carefully
at
the
superscription
and
the
seal
,
lit
a
candle
,
and
burnt
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
I
perform
my
promise
,
"
he
said
,
"
but
this
matter
,
Mr.
Hartright
,
shall
not
end
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
agent
had
kept
at
the
door
the
cab
in
which
he
had
returned
.
<EOS>
He
and
the
maid
-
servant
now
busied
themselves
in
removing
the
luggage
.
<EOS>
Madame
Fosco
came
downstairs
,
thickly
veiled
,
with
the
travelling
cage
of
the
white
mice
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
neither
spoke

me

looked
towards
me

<EOS>
Her
husband
escorted
her
to
the
cab
.
"
<EOS>
Follow
me
as
far
as
the
passage
,
"
he
whispered
in
my
ear
;
"
I
may
want
to
speak
to
you
at
the
last
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
went
out
to
the
door
,
the
agent
standing
below
me
in
the
front
garden
.
<EOS>
The
Count
came
back
alone
,
and
drew
me
a
few
steps
inside
the
passage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Remember
the
Third
condition
!
"
<EOS>
he
whispered
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
hear
from
me
,
Mr.
Hartright
 
<EOS>
I
may
claim
from
you
the
satisfaction
of
a
gentleman
sooner
than
you
think
for
.
"
<EOS>
He
caught
my
hand
before
I
was
aware
of
him
,
and
wrung
it
hard
 
then
turned
to
the
door
,
stopped
,
and
came
back
to
me
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
word
more
,
"
he
said
confidentially
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
last
saw
Miss
Halcombe
,
she
looked
thin
and
ill
.
<EOS>
I
am
anxious
about
that
admirable
woman
.
<EOS>
Take
care
of
her
,
sir
!
<EOS>
With
my
hand
on
my
heart
,
I
solemnly
implore
you
,
take
care
of
Miss
Halcombe
!
"
  
<EOS>
Those
were
the
last
words
he
said
to
me
before
he
squeezed
his
huge
body
into
the
cab
and
drove
off
.
  
<EOS>
The
agent
and
I
waited
at
the
door
a
few
moments
looking
after
him
.
<EOS>
While
we
were
standing
together
,
a
second
cab
appeared
from
a
turning
a
little
way
down
the
road
.
<EOS>
It
followed
the
direction
previously
taken
by
the
Count
's
cab
,
and
as
it
passed
the
house
and
the
open
garden
gate
,
a
person
inside
looked
at
us
out
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
at
the
Opera
again
!
 
<EOS>
the
foreigner
with
a
scar
on
his
left
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wait
here
with
me
,
sir
,
for
half
an
hour
more
!
"
said
Monsieur
Rubelle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
returned
to
the
sitting
-
room
.
<EOS>
I
was
in
no
humour
to
speak
to
the
agent
,
or
to
allow
him
to
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
took
out
the
papers
which
the
Count
had
placed
in
my
hands
,
and
read
the
terrible
story
of
the
conspiracy
told
by
the
man
who
had
planned
and
perpetrated
it
.

THE
COUNT
'S
NARRATIVE
  
<EOS>
In
the
summer
of
eighteen
hundred
and
fifty
I
arrived
in
England
,
charged
with
a
delicate
political
mission
from
abroad
.
<EOS>
Confidential
persons
were
semi
-
officially
connected
with
me
,
whose
exertions
I
was
authorised
to
direct
,
<EOS>
Monsieur
and
Madame
Rubelle
being
among
the
number
.
<EOS>
Some
weeks
of
spare
time
were
at
my
disposal
,
before
I
entered
on
my
functions
by
establishing
myself
in
the
suburbs
of
London
.
<EOS>
Curiosity
may
stop
here
to
ask
for
some
explanation
of
those
functions
on
my
part
.
<EOS>
I
entirely
sympathise
with
the
request
.
<EOS>
I
also
regret
that
diplomatic
reserve
forbids
me
to
comply
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
arranged
to
pass
the
preliminary
period
of
repose
,
to
which
I
have
just
referred
,
in
the
superb
mansion
of
my
late
lamented
friend
,
Sir
Percival
Glyde
.
<EOS>
HE
arrived
from
the
Continent
with
his
wife
.
<EOS>
I
arrived
from
the
Continent
with
MINE
.
<EOS>
England
is
the
land
of
domestic
happiness
 
how
appropriately
we
entered
it
under
these
domestic
circumstances
!
  
<EOS>
The
bond
of
friendship
which
united
Percival
and
myself
was
strengthened
,
on
this
occasion
,
by
a
touching
similarity
in
the
pecuniary
position
on
his
side
and
on
mine
.
<EOS>
We
both
wanted
money
.
<EOS>
Immense
necessity
!
<EOS>
Universal
want
!
<EOS>
Is
there
a
civilised
human
being
who
does
not
feel
for
us
?
<EOS>
How
insensible
must
that
man
be
!
<EOS>
Or
how
rich
!
  
<EOS>
I
enter
into
no
sordid
particulars
,
in
discussing
this
part
of
the
subject
.
<EOS>
My
mind
recoils
from
them
.
<EOS>
With
a
Roman
austerity
,
I
show
my
empty
purse
and
Percival
's
to
the
shrinking
public
gaze
.
<EOS>
Let
us
allow
the
deplorable
fact
to
assert
itself
,
once
for
all
,
in
that
manner
,
and
pass
on
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
received
at
the
mansion
by
the
magnificent
creature
who
is
inscribed
on
my
heart
as
"
Marian
,
"
who
is
known
in
the
colder
atmosphere
of
society
as
"
Miss
Halcombe
.
"
  
<EOS>
Just
Heaven
!
<EOS>
with
what
inconceivable
rapidity
I
learnt
to
adore
that
woman
.
<EOS>
At
sixty
,
I
worshipped
her
with
the
volcanic
ardour
of
eighteen
.
<EOS>
All
the
gold
of
my
rich
nature
was
poured
hopelessly
at
her
feet
.
<EOS>
My
wife
 
poor
angel
!
 
<EOS>
my
wife
,
who
adores
me
,
got
nothing
but
the
shillings
and
the
pennies
.
<EOS>
Such
is
the
World
,
such
Man
,
such
Love
.
<EOS>
What
are
we
(
I
ask
)
but
puppets
in
a
show
-
box
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
omnipotent
Destiny
,
pull
our
strings
gently
!
<EOS>
Dance
us
mercifully
off
our
miserable
little
stage
!
  
<EOS>
The
preceding
lines
,
rightly
understood
,
express
an
entire
system
of
philosophy
.
<EOS>
It
is
mine
.
  
<EOS>
I
resume
.
  
<EOS>
The
domestic
position
at
the
commencement
of
our
residence
at
Blackwater
Park
has
been
drawn
with
amazing
accuracy
,
with
profound
mental
insight
,
by
the
hand
of
Marian
herself
.
<EOS>
(
Pass
me
the
intoxicating
familiarity
of
mentioning
this
sublime
creature
by
her
Christian
name
.
)
<EOS>
Accurate
knowledge
of
the
contents
of
her
journal
 
to
which
I
obtained
access
by
clandestine
means
,
unspeakably
precious
to
me
in
the
remembrance
 
warns
my
eager
pen
from
topics
which
this
essentially
exhaustive
woman
has
already
made
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
The
interests
 
interests
,
breathless
and
immense
!
 
<EOS>
with
which
I
am
here
concerned
,
begin
with
the
deplorable
calamity
of
Marian
's
illness
.
  
<EOS>
The
situation
at
this
period
was
emphatically
a
serious
one
.
<EOS>
Large
sums
of
money
,
due
at
a
certain
time
,
were
wanted
by
Percival
(
I
say
nothing
of
the
modicum
equally
necessary
to
myself
)
,
and
the
one
source
to
look
to
for
supplying
them
was
the
fortune
of
his
wife
,
of
which
not
one
farthing
was
at
his
disposal
until
her
death
.
<EOS>
Bad
so
far
,
and
worse
still
farther
on
.
<EOS>
My
lamented
friend
had
private
troubles
of
his
own
,
into
which
the
delicacy
of
my
disinterested
attachment
to
him
forbade
me
from
inquiring
too
curiously
.
<EOS>
I
knew
nothing
but
that
a
woman
,
named
Anne
Catherick
,
was
hidden
in
the
neighbourhood
,
that
she
was
in
communication
with
Lady
Glyde
,
and
that
the
disclosure
of
a
secret
,
which
would
be
the
certain
ruin
of
Percival
,
might
be
the
result
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
me
himself
that
he
was
a
lost
man
,
unless
his
wife
was
silenced
,
and
unless
Anne
Catherick
was
found
.
<EOS>
If
he
was
a
lost
man
,
what
would
become
of
our
pecuniary
interests
?
<EOS>
Courageous
as
I
am
by
nature
,
I
absolutely
trembled
at
the
idea
!
  
<EOS>
The
whole
force
of
my
intelligence
was
now
directed
to
the
finding
of
Anne
Catherick
.
<EOS>
Our
money
affairs
,
important
as
they
were
,
admitted
of
delay
 
but
the
necessity
of
discovering
the
woman
admitted
of
none
.
<EOS>
I
only
knew
her
by
description
,
as
presenting
an
extraordinary
personal
resemblance
to
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
The
statement
of
this
curious
fact
 
intended
merely
to
assist
me
in
identifying
the
person
of
whom
we
were
in
search
 
when
coupled
with
the
additional
information
that
Anne
Catherick
had
escaped
from
a
mad
-
house
,
started
the
first
immense
conception
in
my
mind
,
which
subsequently
led
to
such
amazing
results
.
<EOS>
That
conception
involved
nothing
less
than
the
complete
transformation
of
two
separate
identities
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
and
Anne
Catherick
were
to
change
names
,
places
,
and
destinies
,
the
one
with
the
other
 
the
prodigious
consequences
contemplated
by
the
change
being
the
gain
of
thirty
thousand
pounds
,
and
the
eternal
preservation
of
Sir
Percival
's
secret
.
  
<EOS>
My
instincts
(
which
seldom
err
)
suggested
to
me
,
on
reviewing
the
circumstances
,
that
our
invisible
Anne
would
,
sooner
or
later
,
return
to
the
boat
-
house
at
the
Blackwater
lake
.
<EOS>
There
I
posted
myself
,
previously
mentioning
to
Mrs.
Michelson
,
the
housekeeper
,
that
I
might
be
found
when
wanted
,
immersed
in
study
,
in
that
solitary
place
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
rule
never
to
make
unnecessary
mysteries
,
and
never
to
set
people
suspecting
me
for
want
of
a
little
seasonable
candour
on
my
part
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Michelson
believed
in
me
from
first
to
last
.
<EOS>
This
ladylike
person
(
widow
of
a
Protestant
priest
)
overflowed
with
faith
.
<EOS>
Touched
by
such
superfluity
of
simple
confidence
in
a
woman
of
her
mature
years
,
I
opened
the
ample
reservoirs
of
my
nature
and
absorbed
it
all
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
rewarded
for
posting
myself
sentinel
at
the
lake
by
the
appearance
 
not
of
Anne
Catherick
herself
,
but
of
the
person
in
charge
of
her
.
<EOS>
This
individual
also
overflowed
with
simple
faith
,
which
I
absorbed
in
myself
,
as
in
the
case
already
mentioned
.
<EOS>
I
leave
her
to
describe
the
circumstances
(
if
she
has
not
done
so
already
)
under
which
she
introduced
me
to
the
object
of
her
maternal
care
.
<EOS>
When
I
first
saw
Anne
Catherick
<EOS>
she
was
asleep
.
<EOS>
I
was
electrified
by
the
likeness
between
this
unhappy
woman
and
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
The
details
of
the
grand
scheme
which
had
suggested
themselves
in
outline
only
,
up
to
that
period
,
occurred
to
me
,
in
all
their
masterly
combination
,
at
the
sight
of
the
sleeping
face
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
my
heart
,
always
accessible
to
tender
influences
,
dissolved
in
tears
at
the
spectacle
of
suffering
before
me
.
<EOS>
I
instantly
set
myself
to
impart
relief
.
<EOS>
In
other
words
,
I
provided
the
necessary
stimulant
for
strengthening
Anne
Catherick
to
perform
the
journey
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
The
best
years
of
my
life
have
been
passed
in
the
ardent
study
of
medical
and
chemical
science
.
<EOS>
Chemistry
especially
has
always
had
irresistible
attractions
for
me
from
the
enormous
,
the
illimitable
power
which
the
knowledge
of
it
confers
.
<EOS>
Chemists
 
<EOS>
I
assert
it
<EOS>
emphatically
 
might
sway
,
if
they
pleased
,
the
destinies
of
humanity
.
<EOS>
Let
me
explain
this
before
I
go
further
.
  
<EOS>
Mind
,
they
say
,
rules
the
world
.
<EOS>
But
what
rules
the
mind
?
<EOS>
The
body
(
follow
me
closely
here
)
lies
at
the
mercy
of
the
most
omnipotent
of
all
potentates
 
the
Chemist
.
<EOS>
Give
me
 
Fosco
 
chemistry
;
and
when
Shakespeare
has
conceived
Hamlet
,
and
sits
down
to
execute
the
conception
 
with
a
few
grains
of
powder
dropped
into
his
daily
food
,
I
will
reduce
his
mind
,
by
the
action
of
his
body
,
till
his
pen
pours
out
the
most
abject
drivel
that
has
ever
degraded
paper
.
<EOS>
Under
similar
circumstances
,
revive
me
the
illustrious
Newton
.
<EOS>
I
guarantee
that
when
he
sees
the
apple
fall
he
shall
EAT
IT
,
instead
of
discovering
the
principle
of
gravitation
.
<EOS>
Nero
's
dinner
shall
transform
Nero
into
the
mildest
of
men
before
he
has
done
digesting
it
,
and
the
morning
draught
of
Alexander
the
Great
shall
make
Alexander
run
for
his
life
at
the
first
sight
of
the
enemy
the
same
afternoon
.
<EOS>
On
my
sacred
word
of
honour
it
is
lucky
for
Society
that
modern
chemists
are
,
by
incomprehensible
good
fortune
,
the
most
harmless
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
The
mass
are
worthy
fathers
of
families
,
who
keep
shops
.
<EOS>
The
few
are
philosophers
besotted
with
admiration
for
the
sound
of
their
own
lecturing
voices
,
visionaries
who
waste
their
lives
on
fantastic
impossibilities
,
or
quacks
whose
ambition
soars
no
higher
than
our
corns
.
<EOS>
Thus
Society
escapes
,
and
the
illimitable
power
of
Chemistry
remains
the
slave
of
the
most
superficial
and
the
most
insignificant
ends
.
  
<EOS>
Why
this
outburst
?
<EOS>
Why
this
withering
eloquence
?
  
<EOS>
Because
my
conduct
has
been
misrepresented
,
because
my
motives
have
been
misunderstood
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
assumed
that
I
used
my
vast
chemical
resources
against
Anne
Catherick
,
and
that
I
would
have
used
them
if
I
could
against
the
magnificent
Marian
herself
.
<EOS>
Odious
insinuations
both
!
<EOS>
All
my
interests
were
concerned
(
as
will
be
seen
presently
)
in
the
preservation
of
Anne
Catherick
's
life
.
<EOS>
All
my
anxieties
were
concentrated
on
Marian
's
rescue
from
the
hands
of
the
licensed
imbecile
who
attended
her
,
and
who
found
my
advice
confirmed
from
first
to
last
by
the
physician
from
London
.
<EOS>
On
two
occasions
only
 
both
equally
harmless
to
the
individual
on
whom
I
practised
 
<EOS>
did
I
summon
to
myself
the
assistance
of
chemical
knowledge
.
<EOS>
On
the
first
of
the
two
,
after
following
Marian
to
the
inn
at
Blackwater
(
studying
,
behind
a
convenient
waggon
which
hid
me
from
her
,
the
poetry
of
motion
,
as
embodied
in
her
walk
)
,
I
availed
myself
of
the
services
of
my
invaluable
wife
,
to
copy
one
and
to
intercept
the
other
of
two
letters
which
my
adored
enemy
had
entrusted
to
a
discarded
maid
.
<EOS>
In
this
case
,
the
letters
being
in
the
bosom
of
the
girl
's
dress
,
Madame
Fosco
could
only
open
them
,
read
them
,
perform
her
instructions
,
seal
them
,
and
put
them
back
again
by
scientific
assistance
 
<EOS>
which
assistance
I
rendered
in
a
half
-
ounce
bottle
.
<EOS>
The
second
occasion
,
when
the
same
means
were
employed
,
was
the
occasion
(
to
which
I
shall
soon
refer
)
of
Lady
Glyde
's
arrival
in
London
.
<EOS>
Never
at
any
other
time
was
I
indebted
to
my
Art
as
distinguished
from
myself
.
<EOS>
To
all
other
emergencies
and
complications
my
natural
capacity
for
grappling
,
single
-
handed
,
with
circumstances
,
was
invariably
equal
.
<EOS>
I
affirm
the
all
-
pervading
intelligence
of
that
capacity
.
<EOS>
At
the
expense
of
the
Chemist
I
vindicate
the
Man
.
  
<EOS>
Respect
this
outburst
of
generous
indignation
.
<EOS>
It
has
inexpressibly
relieved
me
.
<EOS>
En
route
!
<EOS>
Let
us
proceed
.
  
<EOS>
Having
suggested
to
Mrs.
Clement
(
or
Clements
,
I
am
not
sure
which
)
that
the
best
method
of
keeping
Anne
out
of
Percival
's
reach
was
to
remove
her
to
London
 
having
found
that
my
proposal
was
eagerly
received
,
and
having
appointed
a
day
to
meet
the
travellers
at
the
station
and
to
see
them
leave
it
,
I
was
at
liberty
to
return
to
the
house
and
to
confront
the
difficulties
which
still
remained
to
be
met
.
  
<EOS>
My
first
proceeding
was
to
avail
myself
of
the
sublime
devotion
of
my
wife
.
<EOS>
I
had
arranged
with
Mrs.
Clements
that
she
should
communicate
her
London
address
,
in
Anne
's
interests
,
to
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
not
enough
.
<EOS>
Designing
persons
in
my
absence
might
shake
the
simple
confidence
of
Mrs.
Clements
,
and
she
might
not
write
after
all
.
<EOS>
Who
could
I
find
capable
of
travelling
to
London
by
the
train
she
travelled
by
,
and
of
privately
seeing
her
home
?
<EOS>
I
asked
myself
this
question
.
<EOS>
The
conjugal
part
of
me
immediately
answered
 
Madame
Fosco
.
  
<EOS>
After
deciding
on
my
wife
's
mission
to
London
,
I
arranged
that
the
journey
should
serve
a
double
purpose
.
<EOS>
A
nurse
for
the
suffering
Marian
,
equally
devoted
to
the
patient
and
to
myself
,
was
a
necessity
of
my
position
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
most
eminently
confidential
and
capable
women
in
existence
was
by
good
fortune
at
my
disposal
.
<EOS>
I
refer
to
that
respectable
matron
,
Madame
Rubelle
,
to
whom
I
addressed
a
letter
,
at
her
residence
in
London
,
by
the
hands
of
my
wife
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
appointed
day
Mrs.
Clements
and
Anne
Catherick
met
me
at
the
station
.
<EOS>
I
politely
saw
them
off
,
I
politely
saw
Madame
Fosco
off
by
the
same
train
.
<EOS>
The
last
thing
at
night
my
wife
returned
to
Blackwater
,
having
followed
her
instructions
with
the
most
unimpeachable
accuracy
.
<EOS>
She
was
accompanied
by
Madame
Rubelle
,
and
she
brought
me
the
London
address
of
Mrs.
Clements
.
<EOS>
After
-
events
proved
this
last
precaution
to
have
been
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
punctually
informed
Lady
Glyde
of
her
place
of
abode
.
<EOS>
With
a
wary
eye
on
future
emergencies
,
I
kept
the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
The
same
day
I
had
a
brief
interview
with
the
doctor
,
at
which
I
protested
,
in
the
sacred
interests
of
humanity
,
against
his
treatment
of
Marian
's
case
.
<EOS>
He
was
insolent
,
as
all
ignorant
people
are
.
<EOS>
I
showed
no
resentment
,
I
deferred
quarrelling
with
him
till
it
was
necessary
to
quarrel
to
some
purpose
.
<EOS>
My
next
proceeding
was
to
leave
Blackwater
myself
.
<EOS>
I
had
my
London
residence
to
take
in
anticipation
of
coming
events
.
<EOS>
I
had
also
a
little
business
of
the
domestic
sort
to
transact
with
Mr.
Frederick
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
I
found
the
house
I
wanted
in
St.
John
's
Wood
.
<EOS>
I
found
Mr.
Fairlie
at
Limmeridge
,
Cumberland
.
  
<EOS>
My
own
private
familiarity
with
the
nature
of
Marian
's
correspondence
had
previously
informed
me
that
she
had
written
to
Mr.
Fairlie
,
proposing
,
as
a
relief
to
Lady
Glyde
's
matrimonial
embarrassments
,
to
take
her
on
a
visit
to
her
uncle
in
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
This
letter
I
had
wisely
allowed
to
reach
its
destination
,
feeling
at
the
time
that
it
could
do
no
harm
,
and
might
do
good
.
<EOS>
I
now
presented
myself
before
Mr.
Fairlie
to
support
Marian
's
own
proposal
 
with
certain
modifications
which
,
happily
for
the
success
of
my
plans
,
were
rendered
really
inevitable
by
her
illness
.
<EOS>
It
was
necessary
that
Lady
Glyde
should
leave
Blackwater
alone
,
by
her
uncle
's
invitation
,
and
that
she
should
rest
a
night
on
the
journey
at
her
aunt
's
house
(
the
house
I
had
in
St.
John
's
Wood
)
by
her
uncle
's
express
advice
.
<EOS>
To
achieve
these
results
,
and
to
secure
a
note
of
invitation
which
could
be
shown
to
Lady
Glyde
,
were
the
objects
of
my
visit
to
Mr.
Fairlie
.
<EOS>
When
I
have
mentioned
that
this
gentleman
was
equally
feeble
in
mind
and
body
,
and
that
I
let
loose
the
whole
force
of
my
character
on
him
,
I
have
said
enough
.
<EOS>
I
came
,
saw
,
and
conquered
Fairlie
.
  
<EOS>
On
my
return
to
Blackwater
Park
(
with
the
letter
of
invitation
)
I
found
that
the
doctor
's
imbecile
treatment
of
Marian
's
case
had
led
to
the
most
alarming
results
.
<EOS>
The
fever
had
turned
to
typhus
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
,
on
the
day
of
my
return
,
tried
to
force
herself
into
the
room
to
nurse
her
sister
.
<EOS>
She
and
I
had
no
affinities
of
sympathy
 
<EOS>
she
had
committed
the
unpardonable
outrage
on
my
sensibilities
of
calling
me
a
spy
 
<EOS>
she
was
a
stumbling
-
block
in
my
way
and
in
<EOS>
Percival
's
 
but
,
for
all
that
,
my
magnanimity
forbade
me
to
put
her
in
danger
of
infection
with
my
own
hand
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
I
offered
no
hindrance
to
her
putting
herself
in
danger
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
succeeded
in
doing
so
,
the
intricate
knot
which
I
was
slowly
and
patiently
operating
on
might
perhaps
have
been
cut
by
circumstances
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
the
doctor
interfered
and
she
was
kept
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
myself
previously
recommended
sending
for
advice
to
London
.
<EOS>
This
course
had
been
now
taken
.
<EOS>
The
physician
,
on
his
arrival
,
confirmed
my
view
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
The
crisis
was
serious
.
<EOS>
But
we
had
hope
of
our
charming
patient
on
the
fifth
day
from
the
appearance
of
the
typhus
.
<EOS>
I
was
only
once
absent
from
Blackwater
at
this
time
 
when
I
went
to
London
by
the
morning
train
to
make
the
final
arrangements
at
my
house
in
St.
John
's
Wood
,
to
assure
myself
by
private
inquiry
that
Mrs.
Clements
had
not
moved
,
and
to
settle
one
or
two
little
preliminary
matters
with
the
husband
of
Madame
Rubelle
.
<EOS>
I
returned
at
night
.
<EOS>
Five
days
afterwards
the
physician
pronounced
our
interesting
Marian
to
be
out
of
all
danger
,
and
to
be
in
need
of
nothing
but
careful
nursing
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
time
I
had
waited
for
.
<EOS>
Now
that
medical
attendance
was
no
longer
indispensable
,
I
played
the
first
move
in
the
game
by
asserting
myself
against
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
He
was
one
among
many
witnesses
in
my
way
whom
it
was
necessary
to
remove
.
<EOS>
A
lively
altercation
between
us
(
in
which
Percival
,
previously
instructed
by
me
,
refused
to
interfere
)
served
the
purpose
in
view
.
<EOS>
I
descended
on
the
miserable
man
in
an
irresistible
avalanche
of
indignation
,
and
swept
him
from
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
The
servants
were
the
next
encumbrances
to
get
rid
of
.
<EOS>
Again
I
instructed
Percival
(
whose
moral
courage
required
perpetual
stimulants
)
,
and
Mrs.
Michelson
was
amazed
,
one
day
,
by
hearing
from
her
master
that
the
establishment
was
to
be
broken
up
.
<EOS>
We
cleared
the
house
of
all
the
servants
but
one
,
who
was
kept
for
domestic
purposes
,
and
whose
lumpish
stupidity
we
could
trust
to
make
no
embarrassing
discoveries
.
<EOS>
When
they
were
gone
,
nothing
remained
but
to
relieve
ourselves
of
Mrs.
Michelson
 
a
result
which
was
easily
achieved
by
sending
this
amiable
lady
to
find
lodgings
for
her
mistress
at
the
sea
-
side
.
  
<EOS>
The
circumstances
were
now
exactly
what
they
were
required
to
be
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
was
confined
to
her
room
by
nervous
illness
,
and
the
lumpish
housemaid
(
I
forget
her
name
)
was
shut
up
there
at
night
in
attendance
on
her
mistress
.
<EOS>
Marian
,
though
fast
recovering
,
still
kept
her
bed
,
with
Mrs.
Rubelle
for
nurse
.
<EOS>
No
other
living
creatures
but
my
wife
,
myself
,
and
Percival
were
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
With
all
the
chances
thus
in
our
favour
I
confronted
the
next
emergency
,
and
played
the
second
move
in
the
game
.
  
<EOS>
The
object
of
the
second
move
was
to
induce
Lady
Glyde
to
leave
Blackwater
unaccompanied
by
her
sister
.
<EOS>
Unless
we
could
persuade
her
that
Marian
had
gone
on
to
Cumberland
first
,
there
was
no
chance
of
removing
her
,
of
her
own
free
will
,
from
the
house
.
<EOS>
To
produce
this
necessary
operation
in
her
mind
,
we
concealed
our
interesting
invalid
in
one
of
the
uninhabited
bedrooms
at
Blackwater
.
<EOS>
At
the
dead
of
night
Madame
Fosco
,
Madame
Rubelle
,
and
myself
<EOS>
(
Percival
not
being
cool
enough
to
be
trusted
)
accomplished
the
concealment
.
<EOS>
The
scene
was
picturesque
,
mysterious
,
dramatic
in
the
highest
degree
.
<EOS>
By
my
directions
the
bed
had
been
made
,
in
the
morning
,
on
a
strong
movable
framework
of
wood
.
<EOS>
We
had
only
to
lift
the
framework
gently
at
the
head
and
foot
,
and
to
transport
our
patient
where
we
pleased
,
without
disturbing
herself
or
her
bed
.
<EOS>
No
chemical
assistance
was
needed
or
used
in
this
case
.
<EOS>
Our
interesting
Marian
lay
in
the
deep
repose
of
convalescence
.
<EOS>
We
placed
the
candles
and
opened
the
doors
beforehand
.
<EOS>
I
,
in
right
of
my
great
personal
strength
,
took
the
head
of
the
framework
 
<EOS>
my
wife
and
Madame
Rubelle
took
the
foot
.
<EOS>
I
bore
my
share
of
that
inestimably
precious
burden
with
a
manly
tenderness
,
with
a
fatherly
care
.
<EOS>
Where
is
the
modern
Rembrandt
who
could
depict
our
midnight
procession
?
<EOS>
Alas
for
the
Arts
!
<EOS>
alas
for
this
most
pictorial
of
subjects
!
<EOS>
The
modern
Rembrandt
is
nowhere
to
be
found
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
my
wife
and
I
started
for
London
,
leaving
Marian
secluded
,
in
the
uninhabited
middle
of
the
house
,
under
care
of
Madame
Rubelle
,
who
kindly
consented
to
imprison
herself
with
her
patient
for
two
or
three
days
.
<EOS>
Before
taking
our
departure
I
gave
Percival
Mr.
Fairlie
's
letter
of
invitation
to
his
niece
(
instructing
her
to
sleep
on
the
journey
to
Cumberland
at
her
aunt
's
house
)
,
with
directions
to
show
it
to
Lady
Glyde
on
hearing
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
also
obtained
from
him
the
address
of
the
Asylum
in
which
Anne
Catherick
had
been
confined
,
and
a
letter
to
the
proprietor
,
announcing
to
that
gentleman
the
return
of
his
runaway
patient
to
medical
care
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
arranged
,
at
my
last
visit
to
the
metropolis
,
to
have
our
modest
domestic
establishment
ready
to
receive
us
when
we
arrived
in
London
by
the
early
train
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
wise
precaution
,
we
were
enabled
that
same
day
to
play
the
third
move
in
the
game
 
the
getting
possession
of
Anne
Catherick
.
  
<EOS>
Dates
are
of
importance
here
.
<EOS>
I
combine
in
myself
the
opposite
characteristics
of
a
Man
of
Sentiment
and
a
Man
of
Business
.
<EOS>
I
have
all
the
dates
at
my
fingers
'
ends
.
  
<EOS>
On
Wednesday
,
the
24th
of
July
1850
,
I
sent
my
wife
in
a
cab
to
clear
Mrs.
Clements
out
of
the
way
,
in
the
first
place
.
<EOS>
A
supposed
message
from
Lady
Glyde
in
London
was
sufficient
to
obtain
this
result
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clements
was
taken
away
in
the
cab
,
and
was
left
in
the
cab
,
while
my
wife
(
on
pretence
of
purchasing
something
at
a
shop
)
gave
her
the
slip
,
and
returned
to
receive
her
expected
visitor
at
our
house
in
St.
John
's
Wood
.
<EOS>
It
is
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
the
visitor
had
been
described
to
the
servants
as
"
Lady
Glyde
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
I
had
followed
in
another
cab
,
with
a
note
for
Anne
Catherick
,
merely
mentioning
that
Lady
Glyde
intended
to
keep
Mrs.
Clements
to
spend
the
day
with
her
,
and
that
she
was
to
join
them
under
care
of
the
good
gentleman
waiting
outside
,
who
had
already
saved
her
from
discovery
in
Hampshire
by
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
The
"
good
gentleman
"
sent
in
this
note
by
a
street
boy
,
and
paused
for
results
a
door
or
two
farther
on
.
<EOS>
At
the
moment
when
Anne
appeared
at
the
house
door
and
closed
it
<EOS>
this
excellent
man
had
the
cab
door
open
ready
for
her
,
absorbed
her
into
the
vehicle
,
and
drove
off
.
  
<EOS>
(
Pass
me
,
here
,
one
exclamation
in
parenthesis
.
<EOS>
How
interesting
this
is
!
)
  
<EOS>
On
the
way
to
Forest
Road
<EOS>
my
companion
showed
no
fear
.
<EOS>
I
can
be
paternal
 
<EOS>
no
man
<EOS>
more
so
 
<EOS>
when
I
please
,
<EOS>
and
I
was
intensely
paternal
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
What
titles
I
had
to
her
confidence
!
<EOS>
I
had
compounded
the
medicine
which
had
done
her
good
 
<EOS>
I
had
warned
her
of
her
danger
from
Sir
Percival
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
trusted
too
implicitly
to
these
titles
 
<EOS>
perhaps
I
underrated
the
keenness
of
the
lower
instincts
in
persons
of
weak
intellect
 
<EOS>
it
is
certain
that
I
neglected
to
prepare
her
sufficiently
for
a
disappointment
on
entering
my
house
.
<EOS>
When
I
took
her
into
the
drawing
-
room
 
when
she
saw
no
one
present
but
Madame
Fosco
,
who
was
a
stranger
to
her
 
<EOS>
she
exhibited
the
most
violent
agitation
;
if
she
had
scented
danger
in
the
air
,
as
a
dog
scents
the
presence
of
some
creature
unseen
,
her
alarm
could
not
have
displayed
itself
more
suddenly
and
more
causelessly
.
<EOS>
I
interposed
in
vain
.
<EOS>
The
fear
from
which
she
was
suffering
I
might
have
soothed
,
but
the
serious
heart
-
disease
,
under
which
she
laboured
,
was
beyond
the
reach
of
all
moral
palliatives
.
<EOS>
To
my
unspeakable
horror
she
was
seized
with
convulsions
 
a
shock
to
the
system
,
in
her
condition
,
which
might
have
laid
her
dead
at
any
moment
at
our
feet
.
  
<EOS>
The
nearest
doctor
was
sent
for
,
and
was
told
that
"
Lady
Glyde
"
required
his
immediate
services
.
<EOS>
To
my
infinite
relief
,
he
was
a
capable
man
.
<EOS>
I
represented
my
visitor
to
him
as
a
person
of
weak
intellect
,
and
subject
to
delusions
,
and
I
arranged
that
no
nurse
<EOS>
but
my
wife
should
watch
in
the
sick
-
room
.
<EOS>
The
unhappy
woman
was
too
ill
,
however
,
to
cause
any
anxiety
about
what
she
might
say
.
<EOS>
The
one
dread
which
now
oppressed
me
was
the
dread
that
the
false
Lady
Glyde
might
die
before
the
true
Lady
Glyde
arrived
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
written
a
note
in
the
morning
to
Madame
Rubelle
,
telling
her
to
join
me
at
her
husband
's
house
on
the
evening
of
Friday
the
26th
,
with
another
note
to
Percival
,
warning
him
to
show
his
wife
her
uncle
's
letter
of
invitation
,
to
assert
that
Marian
had
gone
on
before
her
,
and
to
despatch
her
to
town
by
the
midday
train
,
on
the
26th
,
also
.
<EOS>
On
reflection
I
had
felt
the
necessity
,
in
Anne
Catherick
's
state
of
health
,
of
precipitating
events
,
and
of
having
Lady
Glyde
at
my
disposal
earlier
than
I
had
originally
contemplated
.
<EOS>
What
fresh
directions
,
in
the
terrible
uncertainty
of
my
position
,
could
I
now
issue
?
<EOS>
I
could
do
nothing
but
trust
to
chance
and
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
My
emotions
expressed
themselves
in
pathetic
apostrophes
,
which
I
was
just
self
-
possessed
enough
to
couple
,
in
the
hearing
of
other
people
,
with
the
name
of
"
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
"
In
all
other
respects
Fosco
,
on
that
memorable
day
,
was
Fosco
shrouded
in
total
eclipse
.
  
<EOS>
She
passed
a
bad
night
<EOS>
,
she
awoke
worn
out
,
but
later
in
the
day
she
revived
amazingly
.
<EOS>
My
elastic
spirits
revived
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
could
receive
no
answers
from
Percival
and
Madame
Rubelle
till
the
morning
of
the
next
day
,
the
26th
.
<EOS>
In
anticipation
of
their
following
my
directions
,
which
,
accident
apart
,
I
knew
they
would
do
,
I
went
to
secure
a
fly
to
fetch
Lady
Glyde
from
the
railway
,
directing
it
to
be
at
my
house
on
the
26th
,
at
two
o'clock
.
<EOS>
After
seeing
the
order
entered
in
the
book
,
I
went
on
to
arrange
matters
with
Monsieur
Rubelle
.
<EOS>
I
also
procured
the
services
of
two
gentlemen
who
could
furnish
me
with
the
necessary
certificates
of
lunacy
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
<EOS>
I
knew
personally
 
the
other
was
known
to
Monsieur
Rubelle
.
<EOS>
Both
were
men
whose
vigorous
minds
soared
superior
to
narrow
scruples
 
both
were
labouring
under
temporary
embarrassments
 
both
believed
in
ME
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
past
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
before
I
returned
from
the
performance
of
these
duties
.
<EOS>
When
I
got
back
Anne
Catherick
was
dead
.
<EOS>
Dead
on
the
25th
,
and
Lady
Glyde
was
not
to
arrive
in
London
till
the
26th
!
  
<EOS>
I
was
stunned
.
<EOS>
Meditate
on
that
.
<EOS>
Fosco
stunned
!
  
<EOS>
It
was
too
late
to
retrace
our
steps
.
<EOS>
Before
my
return
the
doctor
had
officiously
undertaken
to
save
me
all
trouble
by
registering
the
death
,
on
the
date
when
it
happened
,
with
his
own
hand
.
<EOS>
My
grand
scheme
,
unassailable
hitherto
,
had
its
weak
place
now
 
no
efforts
on
my
part
could
alter
the
fatal
event
of
the
25th
.
<EOS>
I
turned
manfully
to
the
future
.
<EOS>
Percival
's
interests
and
mine
being
still
at
stake
,
nothing
was
left
but
to
play
the
game
through
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
I
recalled
my
impenetrable
calm
 
and
played
it
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
morning
of
the
26th
Percival
's
letter
reached
me
,
announcing
his
wife
's
arrival
by
the
midday
train
.
<EOS>
Madame
Rubelle
also
wrote
to
say
she
would
follow
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
I
started
in
the
fly
,
leaving
the
false
Lady
Glyde
dead
in
the
house
,
to
receive
the
true
Lady
Glyde
on
her
arrival
by
the
railway
at
three
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Hidden
under
the
seat
of
the
carriage
,
I
carried
with
me
<EOS>
all
the
clothes
Anne
Catherick
had
worn
on
coming
into
my
house
 
<EOS>
they
were
destined
to
assist
the
resurrection
of
the
woman
who
was
dead
in
the
person
of
the
woman
who
was
living
.
<EOS>
What
a
situation
!
<EOS>
I
suggest
it
to
the
rising
romance
writers
of
England
.
<EOS>
I
offer
it
,
as
totally
new
,
to
the
worn
-
out
dramatists
of
France
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
was
at
the
station
.
<EOS>
There
was
great
crowding
and
confusion
,
and
more
delay
than
I
liked
(
in
case
any
of
her
friends
had
happened
to
be
on
the
spot
)
,
in
reclaiming
her
luggage
.
<EOS>
Her
first
questions
,
as
we
drove
off
,
implored
me
to
tell
her
news
of
her
sister
.
<EOS>
I
invented
news
of
the
most
pacifying
kind
,
assuring
her
that
she
was
about
to
see
her
sister
at
my
house
.
<EOS>
My
house
,
on
this
occasion
only
,
was
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Leicester
Square
,
and
was
in
the
occupation
of
Monsieur
Rubelle
,
who
received
us
in
the
hall
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
my
visitor
upstairs
into
a
back
room
,
the
two
medical
gentlemen
being
there
in
waiting
on
the
floor
beneath
to
see
the
patient
,
and
to
give
me
their
certificates
.
<EOS>
After
quieting
Lady
Glyde
by
the
necessary
assurances
about
her
sister
,
I
introduced
my
friends
separately
to
her
presence
.
<EOS>
They
performed
the
formalities
of
the
occasion
briefly
,
intelligently
,
conscientiously
.
<EOS>
I
entered
the
room
again
as
soon
as
they
had
left
it
,
and
at
once
precipitated
events
by
a
reference
of
the
alarming
kind
to
"
Miss
Halcombe
's
"
state
of
health
.
  
<EOS>
Results
followed
as
I
had
anticipated
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glyde
became
frightened
,
and
turned
faint
.
<EOS>
For
the
second
time
,
and
the
last
,
I
called
Science
to
my
assistance
.
<EOS>
A
medicated
glass
of
water
and
a
medicated
bottle
of
smelling
-
salts
relieved
her
of
all
further
embarrassment
and
alarm
.
<EOS>
Additional
applications
later
in
the
evening
procured
her
the
inestimable
blessing
of
a
good
night
's
rest
.
<EOS>
Madame
Rubelle
arrived
in
time
to
preside
at
Lady
Glyde
's
toilet
.
<EOS>
Her
own
clothes
were
taken
away
from
her
at
night
,
and
Anne
Catherick
's
were
put
on
her
in
the
morning
,
with
the
strictest
regard
to
propriety
,
by
the
matronly
hands
of
the
good
Rubelle
.
<EOS>
Throughout
the
day
I
kept
our
patient
in
a
state
of
partially
-
suspended
consciousness
,
until
the
dexterous
assistance
of
my
medical
friends
enabled
me
to
procure
the
necessary
order
rather
earlier
than
I
had
ventured
to
hope
.
<EOS>
That
evening
(
the
evening
of
the
27th
)
<EOS>
Madame
Rubelle
<EOS>
and
I
took
our
revived
"
Anne
Catherick
"
to
the
Asylum
.
<EOS>
She
was
received
with
great
surprise
,
but
without
suspicion
,
thanks
to
the
order
and
certificates
,
to
Percival
's
letter
,
to
the
likeness
,
to
the
clothes
,
and
to
the
patient
's
own
confused
mental
condition
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
I
returned
at
once
to
assist
Madame
Fosco
in
the
preparations
for
the
burial
of
the
False
"
Lady
Glyde
,
"
having
the
clothes
and
luggage
of
the
true
"
Lady
Glyde
"
in
my
possession
.
<EOS>
They
were
afterwards
sent
to
Cumberland
by
the
conveyance
which
was
used
for
the
funeral
.
<EOS>
I
attended
the
funeral
,
with
becoming
dignity
,
attired
in
the
deepest
mourning
.
  
<EOS>
My
narrative
of
these
remarkable
events
,
written
under
equally
remarkable
circumstances
,
closes
here
.
<EOS>
The
minor
precautions
which
I
observed
in
communicating
with
Limmeridge
House
are
already
known
,
so
is
the
magnificent
success
of
my
enterprise
,
so
are
the
solid
pecuniary
results
which
followed
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
to
assert
,
with
the
whole
force
of
my
conviction
,
that
the
one
weak
place
in
my
scheme
would
never
have
been
found
out
if
the
one
weak
place
in
my
heart
had
not
been
discovered
first
.
<EOS>
Nothing
but
my
fatal
admiration
for
Marian
restrained
me
from
stepping
in
to
my
own
rescue
when
she
effected
her
sister
's
escape
.
<EOS>
I
ran
the
risk
,
and
trusted
in
the
complete
destruction
of
Lady
Glyde
's
identity
.
<EOS>
If
either
Marian
or
Mr.
Hartright
attempted
to
assert
that
identity
,
they
would
publicly
expose
themselves
to
the
imputation
of
sustaining
a
rank
deception
,
they
would
be
distrusted
and
discredited
accordingly
,
and
they
would
therefore
be
powerless
to
place
my
interests
or
Percival
's
secret
in
jeopardy
.
<EOS>
I
committed
one
error
in
trusting
myself
to
such
a
blindfold
calculation
of
chances
as
this
.
<EOS>
I
committed
another
when
Percival
had
paid
the
penalty
of
his
own
obstinacy
and
violence
,
by
granting
Lady
Glyde
a
second
reprieve
from
the
mad
-
house
,
and
allowing
Mr.
Hartright
a
second
chance
of
escaping
me
.
<EOS>
In
brief
,
Fosco
,
at
this
serious
crisis
,
was
untrue
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Deplorable
and
uncharacteristic
fault
!
<EOS>
Behold
the
cause
,
in
my
heart
 
behold
,
in
the
image
of
Marian
Halcombe
,
the
first
and
last
weakness
of
Fosco
's
life
!
  
<EOS>
At
the
ripe
age
of
sixty
,
I
make
this
unparalleled
confession
.
<EOS>
Youths
!
<EOS>
I
invoke
your
sympathy
.
<EOS>
Maidens
!
<EOS>
I
claim
your
tears
.
  
<EOS>
A
word
more
,
and
the
attention
of
the
reader
(
concentrated
breathlessly
on
myself
)
shall
be
released
.
  
<EOS>
My
own
mental
insight
informs
me
that
three
inevitable
questions
will
be
asked
here
by
persons
of
inquiring
minds
.
<EOS>
They
shall
be
stated
 
they
shall
be
answered
.
  
<EOS>
First
question
.
<EOS>
What
is
the
secret
of
Madame
Fosco
's
unhesitating
devotion
of
herself
to
the
fulfilment
of
my
boldest
wishes
,
to
the
furtherance
of
my
deepest
plans
?
<EOS>
I
might
answer
this
by
simply
referring
to
my
own
character
,
and
by
asking
,
in
my
turn
,
Where
,
in
the
history
of
the
world
,
has
a
man
of
my
order
ever
been
found
without
a
woman
in
the
background
self
-
immolated
on
the
altar
of
his
life
?
<EOS>
But
I
remember
that
I
am
writing
in
England
,
I
remember
that
I
was
married
in
England
,
and
I
ask
if
a
woman
's
marriage
obligations
in
this
country
provide
for
her
private
opinion
of
her
husband
's
principles
?
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
They
charge
her
unreservedly
to
love
,
honour
,
and
obey
him
.
<EOS>
That
is
exactly
what
my
wife
has
done
.
<EOS>
I
stand
here
on
a
supreme
moral
elevation
,
and
I
loftily
assert
her
accurate
performance
of
her
conjugal
duties
.
<EOS>
Silence
,
Calumny
!
<EOS>
Your
sympathy
,
Wives
of
England
,
for
Madame
Fosco
!
  
<EOS>
Second
question
.
<EOS>
If
Anne
Catherick
had
not
died
when
she
did
,
what
should
I
have
done
?
<EOS>
I
should
,
in
that
case
,
have
assisted
worn
-
out
Nature
in
finding
permanent
repose
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
opened
the
doors
of
the
Prison
of
Life
,
and
have
extended
to
the
captive
(
incurably
afflicted
in
mind
and
body
both
)
a
happy
release
.
  
<EOS>
Third
question
.
<EOS>
On
a
calm
revision
of
all
the
circumstances
 
Is
my
conduct
worthy
of
any
serious
blame
?
<EOS>
Most
emphatically
,
No
!
<EOS>
Have
I
not
carefully
avoided
exposing
myself
to
the
odium
of
committing
unnecessary
crime
?
<EOS>
With
my
vast
resources
in
chemistry
,
I
might
have
taken
Lady
Glyde
's
life
.
<EOS>
At
immense
personal
sacrifice
I
followed
the
dictates
of
my
own
ingenuity
,
my
own
humanity
,
my
own
caution
,
and
took
her
identity
instead
.
<EOS>
Judge
me
by
what
I
might
have
done
.
<EOS>
How
comparatively
innocent
!
<EOS>
how
indirectly
virtuous
I
appear
in
what
I
really
did
!
  
<EOS>
I
announced
on
beginning
it
that
this
narrative
would
be
a
remarkable
document
.
<EOS>
It
has
entirely
answered
my
expectations
.
<EOS>
Receive
these
fervid
lines
 
my
last
legacy
to
the
country
I
leave
for
ever
.
<EOS>
They
are
worthy
of
the
occasion
,
and
worthy
of
  
FOSCO
.
  
<EOS>
THE
STORY
CONCLUDED
BY
WALTER
HARTRIGHT
      
<EOS>
When
I
closed
the
last
leaf
of
the
Count
's
manuscript
the
half
-
hour
during
which
I
had
engaged
to
remain
at
Forest
Road
had
expired
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
Rubelle
looked
at
his
watch
and
bowed
.
<EOS>
I
rose
immediately
,
and
left
the
agent
in
possession
of
the
empty
house
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
him
again
 
<EOS>
I
never
heard
more
of
him
or
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Out
of
the
dark
byways
of
villainy
and
deceit
they
had
crawled
across
our
path
 
into
the
same
byways
they
crawled
back
secretly
and
were
lost
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
leaving
Forest
Road
I
was
at
home
again
.
  
<EOS>
But
few
words
sufficed
to
tell
Laura
and
Marian
how
my
desperate
venture
had
ended
,
and
what
the
next
event
in
our
lives
was
likely
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
left
all
details
to
be
described
later
in
the
day
,
and
hastened
back
to
St.
John
's
Wood
,
to
see
the
person
of
whom
Count
Fosco
had
ordered
the
fly
,
when
he
went
to
meet
Laura
at
the
station
.
  
<EOS>
The
address
in
my
possession
led
me
to
some
"
livery
stables
,
"
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
from
Forest
Road
.
<EOS>
The
proprietor
proved
to
be
a
civil
and
respectable
man
.
<EOS>
When
I
explained
that
an
important
family
matter
obliged
me
to
ask
him
to
refer
to
his
books
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
a
date
with
which
the
record
of
his
business
transactions
might
supply
me
,
he
offered
no
objection
to
granting
my
request
.
<EOS>
The
book
was
produced
,
and
there
,
under
the
date
of
"
July
26th
,
1850
,
"
the
order
was
entered
in
these
words
    
"
Brougham
to
Count
Fosco
,
5
Forest
Road
.
<EOS>
Two
o'clock
.
<EOS>
(
John
Owen
)
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
found
on
inquiry
that
the
name
of
"
John
Owen
,
"
attached
to
the
entry
,
referred
to
the
man
who
had
been
employed
to
drive
the
fly
.
<EOS>
He
was
then
at
work
in
the
stable
-
yard
,
and
was
sent
for
to
see
me
at
my
request
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
remember
driving
a
gentleman
,
in
the
month
of
July
last
,
from
Number
Five
Forest
Road
to
the
Waterloo
Bridge
station
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
said
the
man
,
"
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
exactly
say
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
remember
the
gentleman
himself
?
<EOS>
Can
you
call
to
mind
driving
a
foreigner
last
summer
 
a
tall
gentleman
and
remarkably
fat
?
"
<EOS>
The
man
's
face
brightened
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
him
,
sir
!
<EOS>
The
fattest
gentleman
as
ever
I
see
,
and
the
heaviest
customer
as
ever
<EOS>
I
drove
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
 
I
call
him
to
mind
,
sir
!
<EOS>
We
DID
go
to
the
station
,
and
it
WAS
from
Forest
Road
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
parrot
,
or
summat
like
it
,
screeching
in
the
window
.
<EOS>
The
gentleman
was
in
a
mortal
hurry
about
the
lady
's
luggage
,
and
he
gave
me
a
handsome
present
for
looking
sharp
and
getting
the
boxes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Getting
the
boxes
!
<EOS>
I
recollected
immediately
that
Laura
's
own
account
of
herself
on
her
arrival
in
London
described
her
luggage
as
being
collected
for
her
by
some
person
whom
Count
Fosco
brought
with
him
to
the
station
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
see
the
lady
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
What
did
she
look
like
?
<EOS>
Was
she
young
or
old
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
what
with
the
hurry
and
the
crowd
of
people
pushing
about
,
I
ca
n't
rightly
say
what
the
lady
looked
like
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
call
nothing
to
mind
about
her
that
I
know
of
excepting
her
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
remember
her
name
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Her
name
was
Lady
Glyde
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
come
to
remember
that
,
when
you
have
forgotten
what
she
looked
like
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
smiled
,
and
shifted
his
feet
in
some
little
embarrassment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
had
n't
been
long
married
at
that
time
,
and
my
wife
's
name
,
before
she
changed
it
for
mine
,
was
the
same
as
the
lady
's
 
meaning
the
name
of
Glyde
,
sir
.
<EOS>
The
lady
mentioned
it
herself
.
<EOS>
"
Is
your
name
on
your
boxes
,
ma'am
?
"
says
I.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
says
she
,
"
my
name
is
on
my
luggage
 
<EOS>
it
is
Lady
Glyde
.
"
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
<EOS>
I
says
to
myself
,
"
I
've
a
bad
head
for
gentlefolks
'
names
in
general
 
<EOS>
but
THIS
one
comes
like
an
old
friend
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
nothing
about
the
time
,
sir
,
it
might
be
nigh
on
a
year
ago
,
or
it
might
n't
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
swear
to
the
stout
gentleman
,
and
swear
to
the
lady
's
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
need
that
he
should
remember
the
time
 
the
date
was
positively
established
by
his
master
's
order
-
book
.
<EOS>
I
felt
at
once
that
the
means
were
now
in
my
power
of
striking
down
the
whole
conspiracy
at
a
blow
with
the
irresistible
weapon
of
plain
fact
.
<EOS>
Without
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
I
took
the
proprietor
of
the
livery
stables
aside
and
told
him
what
the
real
importance
was
of
the
evidence
of
his
order
-
book
and
the
evidence
of
his
driver
.
<EOS>
An
arrangement
to
compensate
him
for
the
temporary
loss
of
the
man
's
services
was
easily
made
,
and
a
copy
of
the
entry
in
the
book
was
taken
by
myself
,
and
certified
as
true
by
the
master
's
own
signature
.
<EOS>
I
left
the
livery
stables
,
having
settled
that
John
Owen
was
to
hold
himself
at
my
disposal
for
the
next
three
days
,
or
for
a
longer
period
if
necessity
required
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
had
in
my
possession
all
the
papers
that
I
wanted
 
the
district
registrar
's
own
copy
of
the
certificate
of
death
,
and
Sir
Percival
's
dated
letter
to
the
Count
,
being
safe
in
my
pocket
-
book
.
  
<EOS>
With
this
written
evidence
about
me
,
and
with
the
coachman
's
answers
fresh
in
my
memory
,
I
next
turned
my
steps
,
for
the
first
time
since
the
beginning
of
all
my
inquiries
,
in
the
direction
of
Mr.
Kyrle
's
office
.
<EOS>
One
of
my
objects
in
paying
him
this
second
visit
was
,
necessarily
,
to
tell
him
what
I
had
done
.
<EOS>
The
other
was
to
warn
him
of
my
resolution
to
take
my
wife
to
Limmeridge
the
next
morning
,
and
to
have
her
publicly
received
and
recognised
in
her
uncle
's
house
.
<EOS>
I
left
it
to
Mr.
Kyrle
to
decide
under
these
circumstances
,
and
in
Mr.
Gilmore
's
absence
,
whether
he
was
or
was
not
bound
,
as
the
family
solicitor
,
to
be
present
on
that
occasion
in
the
family
interests
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
say
nothing
of
Mr.
Kyrle
's
amazement
,
or
of
the
terms
in
which
he
expressed
his
opinion
of
my
conduct
from
the
first
stage
of
the
investigation
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
necessary
to
mention
that
he
at
once
decided
on
accompanying
us
to
Cumberland
.
  
<EOS>
We
started
the
next
morning
by
the
early
train
.
<EOS>
Laura
,
Marian
,
Mr.
Kyrle
,
and
myself
in
one
carriage
,
and
John
Owen
,
with
a
clerk
from
Mr.
Kyrle
's
office
,
occupying
places
in
another
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
Limmeridge
station
we
went
first
to
the
farmhouse
at
Todd
's
Corner
.
<EOS>
It
was
my
firm
determination
that
Laura
should
not
enter
her
uncle
's
house
till
she
appeared
there
publicly
recognised
as
his
niece
.
<EOS>
I
left
Marian
to
settle
the
question
of
accommodation
with
Mrs.
Todd
,
as
soon
as
the
good
woman
had
recovered
from
the
bewilderment
of
hearing
what
our
errand
was
in
Cumberland
,
and
I
arranged
with
her
husband
that
John
Owen
was
to
be
committed
to
the
ready
hospitality
of
the
farm
-
servants
.
<EOS>
These
preliminaries
completed
,
Mr.
Kyrle
and
I
set
forth
together
for
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
write
at
any
length
of
our
interview
with
Mr.
Fairlie
,
for
I
can
not
recall
it
to
mind
without
feelings
of
impatience
and
contempt
,
which
make
the
scene
,
even
in
remembrance
<EOS>
only
,
utterly
repulsive
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
prefer
to
record
simply
that
I
carried
my
point
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
attempted
to
treat
us
on
his
customary
plan
.
<EOS>
We
passed
without
notice
his
polite
insolence
at
the
outset
of
the
interview
.
<EOS>
We
heard
without
sympathy
the
protestations
with
which
he
tried
next
to
persuade
us
that
the
disclosure
of
the
conspiracy
had
overwhelmed
him
.
<EOS>
He
absolutely
whined
and
whimpered
at
last
like
a
fretful
child
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
was
he
to
know
that
his
niece
was
alive
when
he
was
told
that
she
was
dead
?
<EOS>
He
would
welcome
dear
Laura
with
pleasure
,
if
we
would
only
allow
him
time
to
recover
.
<EOS>
Did
we
think
he
looked
as
if
he
wanted
hurrying
into
his
grave
?
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Then
,
why
hurry
him
?
"
<EOS>
He
reiterated
these
remonstrances
at
every
available
opportunity
,
until
I
checked
them
once
for
all
,
by
placing
him
firmly
between
two
inevitable
alternatives
.
<EOS>
I
gave
him
his
choice
between
doing
his
niece
justice
on
my
terms
,
or
facing
the
consequence
of
a
public
assertion
of
her
existence
in
a
court
of
law
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kyrle
,
to
whom
he
turned
for
help
,
told
him
plainly
that
he
must
decide
the
question
then
and
there
.
<EOS>
Characteristically
choosing
the
alternative
which
promised
soonest
to
release
him
from
all
personal
anxiety
,
he
announced
with
a
sudden
outburst
of
energy
,
that
he
was
not
strong
enough
to
bear
any
more
bullying
,
and
that
we
might
do
as
we
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Kyrle
and
I
at
once
went
downstairs
,
and
agreed
upon
a
form
of
letter
which
was
to
be
sent
round
to
the
tenants
who
had
attended
the
false
funeral
,
summoning
them
,
in
Mr.
Fairlie
's
name
,
to
assemble
in
Limmeridge
House
on
the
next
day
but
one
.
<EOS>
An
order
referring
to
the
same
date
was
also
written
,
directing
a
statuary
in
Carlisle
to
send
a
man
to
Limmeridge
churchyard
for
the
purpose
of
erasing
an
inscription
 
Mr.
Kyrle
,
who
had
arranged
to
sleep
in
the
house
,
undertaking
that
Mr.
Fairlie
should
hear
these
letters
read
to
him
,
and
should
sign
them
with
his
own
hand
.
  
<EOS>
I
occupied
the
interval
day
at
the
farm
in
writing
a
plain
narrative
of
the
conspiracy
,
and
in
adding
to
it
a
statement
of
the
practical
contradiction
which
facts
offered
to
the
assertion
of
Laura
's
death
.
<EOS>
This
I
submitted
to
Mr.
Kyrle
before
I
read
it
the
next
day
to
the
assembled
tenants
.
<EOS>
We
also
arranged
the
form
in
which
the
evidence
should
be
presented
at
the
close
of
the
reading
.
<EOS>
After
these
matters
were
settled
,
Mr.
Kyrle
endeavoured
to
turn
the
conversation
next
to
Laura
's
affairs
.
<EOS>
Knowing
,
and
desiring
to
know
nothing
of
those
affairs
,
and
doubting
whether
he
would
approve
,
as
a
man
of
business
,
of
my
conduct
in
relation
to
my
wife
's
life
-
interest
in
the
legacy
left
to
Madame
Fosco
,
I
begged
Mr.
Kyrle
to
excuse
me
if
I
abstained
from
discussing
the
subject
.
<EOS>
It
was
connected
,
as
I
could
truly
tell
him
,
with
those
sorrows
and
troubles
of
the
past
which
we
never
referred
to
among
ourselves
,
and
which
we
instinctively
shrank
from
discussing
with
others
.
  
<EOS>
My
last
labour
,
as
the
evening
approached
,
was
to
obtain
"
The
Narrative
of
the
Tombstone
,
"
by
taking
a
copy
of
the
false
inscription
on
the
grave
before
it
was
erased
.
  
<EOS>
The
day
came
 
the
day
when
Laura
once
more
entered
the
familiar
breakfast
-
room
at
Limmeridge
House
.
<EOS>
All
the
persons
assembled
rose
from
their
seats
as
Marian
and
I
led
her
in
.
<EOS>
A
perceptible
shock
of
surprise
,
an
audible
murmur
of
interest
ran
through
them
,
at
the
sight
of
her
face
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fairlie
was
present
(
by
my
express
stipulation
)
,
with
Mr.
Kyrle
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
His
valet
stood
behind
him
with
a
smelling
-
bottle
ready
in
one
hand
,
and
a
white
handkerchief
,
saturated
with
eau
-
de
-
Cologne
,
in
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
I
opened
the
proceedings
by
publicly
appealing
to
Mr.
Fairlie
to
say
whether
I
appeared
there
with
his
authority
and
under
his
express
sanction
.
<EOS>
He
extended
an
arm
,
on
either
side
,
to
Mr.
Kyrle
and
to
his
valet
 
was
by
them
assisted
to
stand
on
his
legs
,
and
then
expressed
himself
in
these
terms
:
"
<EOS>
Allow
me
to
present
Mr.
Hartright
.
<EOS>
I
am
as
great
an
invalid
as
ever
,
and
he
is
so
very
obliging
as
to
speak
for
me
.
<EOS>
The
subject
is
dreadfully
embarrassing
.
<EOS>
Please
hear
him
,
and
do
n't
make
a
noise
!
"
<EOS>
With
those
words
he
slowly
sank
back
again
into
the
chair
,
and
took
refuge
in
his
scented
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
  
<EOS>
The
disclosure
of
the
conspiracy
followed
,
after
I
had
offered
my
preliminary
explanation
,
first
of
all
,
in
the
fewest
and
the
plainest
words
.
<EOS>
I
was
there
present
<EOS>
(
I
informed
my
hearers
)
to
declare
,
first
,
that
my
wife
,
then
sitting
by
me
,
was
the
daughter
of
the
late
Mr.
Philip
Fairlie
;
secondly
,
to
prove
by
positive
facts
,
that
the
funeral
which
they
had
attended
in
Limmeridge
churchyard
was
the
funeral
of
another
woman
;
thirdly
,
to
give
them
a
plain
account
of
how
it
had
all
happened
.
<EOS>
Without
further
preface
,
I
at
once
read
the
narrative
of
the
conspiracy
,
describing
it
in
clear
outline
,
and
dwelling
only
upon
the
pecuniary
motive
for
it
,
in
order
to
avoid
complicating
my
statement
by
unnecessary
reference
to
Sir
Percival
's
secret
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
I
reminded
my
audience
of
the
date
on
the
inscription
in
the
churchyard
(
the
25th
)
,
and
confirmed
its
correctness
by
producing
the
certificate
of
death
.
<EOS>
I
then
read
them
Sir
Percival
's
letter
of
the
25th
,
announcing
his
wife
's
intended
journey
from
Hampshire
to
London
on
the
26th
.
<EOS>
I
next
showed
that
she
had
taken
that
journey
,
by
the
personal
testimony
of
the
driver
of
the
fly
,
and
I
proved
that
she
had
performed
it
on
the
appointed
day
,
by
the
order
-
book
at
the
livery
stables
.
<EOS>
Marian
then
added
her
own
statement
of
the
meeting
between
Laura
and
herself
at
the
mad
-
house
,
and
of
her
sister
's
escape
.
<EOS>
After
which
I
closed
the
proceedings
by
informing
the
persons
present
of
Sir
Percival
's
death
and
of
my
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Kyrle
rose
when
I
resumed
my
seat
,
and
declared
,
as
the
legal
adviser
of
the
family
,
that
my
case
was
proved
by
the
plainest
evidence
he
had
ever
heard
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
those
words
,
I
put
my
arm
round
Laura
,
and
raised
her
so
that
she
was
plainly
visible
to
every
one
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Are
you
all
of
the
same
opinion
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
advancing
towards
them
a
few
steps
,
and
pointing
to
my
wife
.
  
<EOS>
The
effect
of
the
question
was
electrical
.
<EOS>
Far
down
at
the
lower
end
of
the
room
one
of
the
oldest
tenants
on
the
estate
started
to
his
feet
,
and
led
the
rest
with
him
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
man
now
,
with
his
honest
brown
face
and
his
iron
-
grey
hair
,
mounted
on
the
window
-
seat
,
waving
his
heavy
riding
-
whip
over
his
head
,
and
leading
the
cheers
.
<EOS>
"
There

"
<EOS>
The
shout
that
answered
him
,
reiterated
again
and
again
,
was
the
sweetest
music
I
ever
heard
.
<EOS>
The
labourers
in
the
village
and
the
boys
from
the
school
,
assembled
on
the
lawn
,
caught
up
the
cheering
and
echoed
it
back
on
us
.
<EOS>
The
farmers
'
wives
clustered
round
Laura
,
and
struggled
which
should
be
first
to
shake
hands
with
her
,
and
to
implore
her
,
with
the
tears
pouring
over
their
own
cheeks
,
to
bear
up
bravely
and
not
to
cry
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
completely
overwhelmed
,
that
I
was
obliged
to
take
her
from
them
,
and
carry
her
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
There
I
gave
her
into
Marian
's
care
 
Marian
,
who
had
never
failed
us
yet
,
whose
courageous
self
-
control
did
not
fail
us
now
.
<EOS>
Left
by
myself
at
the
door
,
I
invited
all
the
persons
present
(
after
thanking
them
in
Laura
's
name
and
mine
)
to
follow
me
to
the
churchyard
,
and
see
the
false
inscription
struck
off
the
tombstone
with
their
own
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
left
the
house
,
and
all
joined
the
throng
of
villagers
collected
round
the
grave
,
where
the
statuary
's
man
was
waiting
for
us
.
<EOS>
In
a
breathless
silence
,
the
first
sharp
stroke
of
the
steel
sounded
on
the
marble
.
<EOS>
Not
a
voice
was
heard
 
not
a
soul
moved
,
till
those
three
words
,
"
Laura
,
Lady
Glyde
,
"
had
vanished
from
sight
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
a
great
heave
of
relief
among
the
crowd
,
as
if
they
felt
that
the
last
fetters
of
the
conspiracy
had
been
struck
off
Laura
herself
,
and
the
assembly
slowly
withdrew
.
<EOS>
It
was
late
in
the
day
before
the
whole
inscription
was
erased
.
<EOS>
One
line
only
was
afterwards
engraved
in
its
place
:
"
Anne
Catherick
,
July
25th
,
1850
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
returned
to
Limmeridge
House
early
enough
in
the
evening
to
take
leave
of
Mr.
Kyrle
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
clerk
,
and
the
driver
of
the
fly
,
went
back
to
London
by
the
night
train
.
<EOS>
On
their
departure
an
insolent
message
was
delivered
to
me
from
Mr.
Fairlie
 
who
had
been
carried
from
the
room
in
a
shattered
condition
,
when
the
first
outbreak
of
cheering
answered
my
appeal
to
the
tenantry
.
<EOS>
The
message
conveyed
to
us
"
Mr.
Fairlie
's
best
congratulations
,
"
and
requested
to
know
whether
"
we
contemplated
stopping
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
I
sent
back
word
that
the
only
object
for
which
we
had
entered
his
doors
was
accomplished
 
that
I
contemplated
stopping
in
no
man
's
house
but
my
own
 
and
that
Mr.
Fairlie
need
not
entertain
the
slightest
apprehension
of
ever
seeing
us
or
hearing
from
us
again
.
<EOS>
We
went
back
to
our
friends
at
the
farm
to
rest
that
night
,
and
the
next
morning
 
escorted
to
the
station
,
with
the
heartiest
enthusiasm
and
good
will
,
by
the
whole
village
and
by
all
the
farmers
in
the
neighbourhood
 
<EOS>
we
returned
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
As
our
view
of
the
Cumberland
hills
faded
in
the
distance
,
I
thought
of
the
first
disheartening
circumstances
under
which
the
long
struggle
that
was
now
past
and
over
had
been
pursued
.
<EOS>
It
was
strange
to
look
back
and
to
see
,
now
,
that
the
poverty
which
had
denied
us
all
hope
of
assistance
had
been
the
indirect
means
of
our
success
,
by
forcing
me
to
act
for
myself
.
<EOS>
If
we
had
been
rich
enough
to
find
legal
help
,
what
would
have
been
the
result
?
<EOS>
The
gain
(
on
Mr.
Kyrle
's
own
showing
)
would
have
been
more
than
doubtful
 
<EOS>
the
loss
,
judging
by
the
plain
test
of
events
as
they
had
really
happened
,
certain
.
<EOS>
The
law
would
never
have
obtained
me
my
interview
with
Mrs.
Catherick
.
<EOS>
The
law
would
never
have
made
Pesca
the
means
of
forcing
a
confession
from
the
Count
.
    
<EOS>
Two
more
events
remain
to
be
added
to
the
chain
before
it
reaches
fairly
from
the
outset
of
the
story
to
the
close
.
  
<EOS>
While
our
new
sense
of
freedom
from
the
long
oppression
of
the
past
was
still
strange
to
us
,
I
was
sent
for
by
the
friend
who
had
given
me
my
first
employment
in
wood
engraving
,
to
receive
from
him
a
fresh
testimony
of
his
regard
for
my
welfare
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
commissioned
by
his
employers
to
go
to
Paris
,
and
to
examine
for
them
a
fresh
discovery
in
the
practical
application
of
his
Art
,
the
merits
of
which
they
were
anxious
to
ascertain
.
<EOS>
His
own
engagements
had
not
allowed
him
leisure
time
to
undertake
the
errand
,
and
he
had
most
kindly
suggested
that
it
should
be
transferred
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
no
hesitation
in
thankfully
accepting
the
offer
,
for
if
I
acquitted
myself
of
my
commission
as
I
hoped
I
should
,
the
result
would
be
a
permanent
engagement
on
the
illustrated
newspaper
,
to
which
I
was
now
only
occasionally
attached
.
  
<EOS>
I
received
my
instructions
and
packed
up
for
the
journey
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
On
leaving
Laura
once
more
(
under
what
changed
circumstances
!
)
<EOS>
in
her
sister
's
care
,
a
serious
consideration
recurred
to
me
,
which
had
more
than
once
crossed
my
wife
's
mind
,
as
well
as
my
own
,
already
 
I
mean
the
consideration
of
Marian
's
future
.
<EOS>
Had
we
any
right
to
let
our
selfish
affection
accept
the
devotion
of
all
that
generous
life
?
<EOS>
Was
it
not
our
duty
,
our
best
expression
of
gratitude
,
to
forget
ourselves
,
and
to
think
only
of
HER
?
<EOS>
I
tried
to
say
this
when
we
were
alone
for
a
moment
,
before
I
went
away
.
<EOS>
She
took
my
hand
,
and
silenced
me
at
the
first
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
After
all
that
we
three
have
suffered
together
,
"
she
said
"
there
can
be
no
parting
between
us
till
the
last
parting
of
all
.
<EOS>
My
heart
and
my
happiness
,
Walter
,
are
with
Laura
and
you
.
<EOS>
Wait
a
little
till
there
are
children
's
voices
at
your
fireside
.
<EOS>
I
will
teach
them
to
speak
for
me
in
THEIR
language
,
and
the
first
lesson
they
say
to
their
father
and
mother
shall
be
 
<EOS>
We
ca
n't
spare
our
aunt
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
My
journey
to
Paris
was
not
undertaken
alone
.
<EOS>
At
the
eleventh
hour
Pesca
decided
that
he
would
accompany
me
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
recovered
his
customary
cheerfulness
since
the
night
at
the
Opera
,
and
he
determined
to
try
what
a
week
's
holiday
would
do
to
raise
his
spirits
.
  
<EOS>
I
performed
the
errand
entrusted
to
me
,
and
drew
out
the
necessary
report
,
on
the
fourth
day
from
our
arrival
in
Paris
.
<EOS>
The
fifth
day
I
arranged
to
devote
to
sight
-
seeing
and
amusements
in
Pesca
's
company
.
  
<EOS>
Our
hotel
had
been
too
full
to
accommodate
us
both
on
the
same
floor
.
<EOS>
My
room
was
on
the
second
story
,
and
Pesca
's
was
above
me
,
on
the
third
.
<EOS>
On
the
morning
of
the
fifth
day
I
went
upstairs
to
see
if
the
Professor
was
ready
to
go
out
.
<EOS>
Just
before
I
reached
the
landing
I
saw
his
door
opened
from
the
inside
 
a
long
,
delicate
,
nervous
hand
(
not
my
friend
's
hand
certainly
)
held
it
ajar
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
I
heard
Pesca
's
voice
saying
eagerly
,
in
low
tones
,
and
in
his
own
language
 
"
I
remember
the
name
,
but
I
do
n't
know
the
man
.
<EOS>
You
saw
at
the
Opera
<EOS>
he
was
so
changed
that
I
could
not
recognise
him
.
<EOS>
I
will
forward
the
report
 
<EOS>
I
can
do
no
more
.
"
<EOS>
"
No
more
need
be
done
,
"
answered
the
second
voice
.
<EOS>
The
door
opened
wide
,
and
the
light
-
haired
man
with
the
scar
on
his
cheek
 
<EOS>
the
man
I
had
seen
following
Count
Fosco
's
cab
a
week
before
 
came
out
.
<EOS>
He
bowed
as
I
drew
aside
to
let
him
pass
 
<EOS>
his
face
was
fearfully
pale
 
<EOS>
and
he
held
fast
by
the
banisters
as
he
descended
the
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
I
pushed
open
the
door
and
entered
Pesca
's
room
.
<EOS>
He
was
crouched
up
,
in
the
strangest
manner
,
in
a
corner
of
the
sofa
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
shrink
from
me
when
I
approached
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
disturbing
you
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
know
you
had
a
friend
with
you
till
I
saw
him
come
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
friend
,
"
said
Pesca
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
him
to
-
day
for
the
first
time
and
the
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
he
has
brought
you
bad
news
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Horrible
news
,
Walter
!
<EOS>
Let
us
go
back
to
London
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
stop
here
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
I
ever
came
.
<EOS>
The
misfortunes
of
my
youth
are
very
hard
upon
me
,
"
he
said
,
turning
his
face
to
the
wall
,
"
very
hard
upon
me
in
my
later
time
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
forget
them
 
<EOS>
and
they
will
not
forget
ME
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
ca
n't
return
,
I
am
afraid
,
before
the
afternoon
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Would
you
like
to
come
out
with
me
in
the
meantime
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
friend
,
I
will
wait
here
.
<EOS>
But
let
us
go
back
to
-
day
 
<EOS>
pray
let
us
go
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
left
him
with
the
assurance
that
he
should
leave
Paris
that
afternoon
.
<EOS>
We
had
arranged
the
evening
before
to
ascend
the
Cathedral
of
Notre
Dame
,
with
Victor
Hugo
's
noble
romance
for
our
guide
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
in
the
French
capital
that
I
was
more
anxious
to
see
,
and
I
departed
by
myself
for
the
church
.
  
<EOS>
Approaching
Notre
Dame
by
the
river
-
side
<EOS>
,
I
passed
on
my
way
the
terrible
dead
-
house
of
Paris
 
the
Morgue
.
<EOS>
A
great
crowd
clamoured
and
heaved
round
the
door
.
<EOS>
There
was
evidently
something
inside
which
excited
the
popular
curiosity
,
and
fed
the
popular
appetite
for
horror
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
walked
on
to
the
church
if
the
conversation
of
two
men
and
a
woman
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
had
not
caught
my
ear
.
<EOS>
They
had
just
come
out
from
seeing
the
sight
in
the
Morgue
,
and
the
account
they
were
giving
of
the
dead
body
to
their
neighbours
described
it
as
the
corpse
of
a
man
 
a
man
of
immense
size
,
with
a
strange
mark
on
his
left
arm
.
  
<EOS>
The
moment
those
words
reached
me
I
stopped
and
took
my
place
with
the
crowd
going
in
.
<EOS>
Some
dim
foreshadowing
of
the
truth
had
crossed
my
mind
when
I
heard
Pesca
's
voice
through
the
open
door
,
and
when
I
saw
the
stranger
's
face
as
he
passed
me
on
the
stairs
of
the
hotel
.
<EOS>
Now
the
truth
itself
was
revealed
to
me
 
revealed
in
the
chance
words
that
had
just
reached
my
ears
.
<EOS>
Other
vengeance
than
mine
had
followed
that
fated
man
from
the
theatre
to
his
own
door
 
from
his
own
door
to
his
refuge
in
Paris
.
<EOS>
Other
vengeance
than
mine
had
called
him
to
the
day
of
reckoning
,
and
had
exacted
from
him
the
penalty
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
The
moment
when
I
had
pointed
him
out
to
Pesca
at
the
theatre
in
the
hearing
of
that
stranger
by
our
side
,
who
was
looking
for
him
too
 
was
the
moment
that
sealed
his
doom
.
<EOS>
I
remembered
the
struggle
in
my
own
heart
,
when
he
and
I
stood
face
to
face
 
the
struggle
before
I
could
let
him
escape
me
 
and
shuddered
as
I
recalled
it
.
  
<EOS>
Slowly
,
inch
by
inch
,
I
pressed
in
with
the
crowd
,
moving
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
great
glass
screen
that
parts
the
dead
from
the
living
at
the
Morgue
 
nearer
and
nearer
,
till
I
was
close
behind
the
front
row
of
spectators
,
and
could
look
in
.
  
<EOS>
There
he
lay
,
unowned
,
unknown
,
exposed
to
the
flippant
curiosity
of
a
French
mob
!
<EOS>
There
was
the
dreadful
end
of
that
long
life
of
degraded
ability
and
heartless
crime
!
<EOS>
Hushed
in
the
sublime
repose
of
death
,
the
broad
,
firm
,
massive
face
and
head
fronted
us
so
grandly
that
the
chattering
Frenchwomen
about
me
lifted
their
hands
in
admiration
,
and
cried
in
shrill
chorus
,
"
Ah
,
what
a
handsome
man
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
wound
that
had
killed
him
had
been
struck
with
a
knife
or
dagger
exactly
over
his
heart
.
<EOS>
No
other
traces
of
violence
appeared
about
the
body
except
on
the
left
arm
,
and
there
,
exactly
in
the
place
where
I
had
seen
the
brand
on
Pesca
's
arm
,
were
two
deep
cuts
in
the
shape
of
the
letter
T
,
which
entirely
obliterated
the
mark
of
the
Brotherhood
.
<EOS>
His
clothes
,
hung
above
him
,
showed
that
he
had
been
himself
conscious
of
his
danger
 
<EOS>
they
were
clothes
that
had
disguised
him
as
a
French
artisan
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
moments
,
but
not
for
longer
,
I
forced
myself
to
see
these
things
through
the
glass
screen
.
<EOS>
I
can
write
of
them
at
no
greater
length
,
for
I
saw
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
The
few
facts
in
connection
with
his
death
which
I
subsequently
ascertained
(
partly
from
Pesca
and
partly
from
other
sources
)
,
may
be
stated
here
before
the
subject
is
dismissed
from
these
pages
.
  
<EOS>
His
body
was
taken
out
of
the
Seine
in
the
disguise
which
I
have
described
,
nothing
being
found
on
him
which
revealed
his
name
,
his
rank
,
or
his
place
of
abode
.
<EOS>
The
hand
that
struck
him
was
never
traced
,
and
the
circumstances
under
which
he
was
killed
were
never
discovered
.
<EOS>
I
leave
others
to
draw
their
own
conclusions
in
reference
to
the
secret
of
the
assassination
as
I
have
drawn
mine
.
<EOS>
When
I
have
intimated
that
the
foreigner
with
the
scar
was
a
member
of
the
Brotherhood
(
admitted
in
Italy
after
Pesca
's
departure
from
his
native
country
)
,
and
when
I
have
further
added
that
the
two
cuts
,
in
the
form
of
a
T
,
on
the
left
arm
of
the
dead
man
,
signified
the
Italian
word
"
Traditore
,
"
and
showed
that
justice
had
been
done
by
the
Brotherhood
on
a
traitor
,
I
have
contributed
all
that
I
know
towards
elucidating
the
mystery
of
Count
Fosco
's
death
.
  
<EOS>
The
body
was
identified
the
day
after
I
had
seen
it
by
means
of
an
anonymous
letter
addressed
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
was
buried
by
Madame
Fosco
in
the
cemetery
of
Pere
la
Chaise
.
<EOS>
Fresh
funeral
wreaths
continue
to
this
day
to
be
hung
on
the
ornamental
bronze
railings
round
the
tomb
by
the
Countess
's
own
hand
.
<EOS>
She
lives
in
the
strictest
retirement
at
Versailles
.
<EOS>
Not
long
since
she
published
a
biography
of
her
deceased
husband
.
<EOS>
The
work
throws
no
light
whatever
on
the
name
that
was
really
his
own
or
on
the
secret
history
of
his
life
 
it
is
almost
entirely
devoted
to
the
praise
of
his
domestic
virtues
,
the
assertion
of
his
rare
abilities
,
and
the
enumeration
of
the
honours
conferred
on
him
.
<EOS>
The
circumstances
attending
his
death
are
very
briefly
noticed
,
and
are
summed
up
on
the
last
page
in
this
sentence
 
<EOS>
"
His
life
was
one
long
assertion
of
the
rights
of
the
aristocracy
and
the
sacred
principles
of
Order
,
and
he
died
a
martyr
to
his
cause
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
The
summer
and
autumn
passed
after
my
return
from
Paris
,
and
brought
no
changes
with
them
which
need
be
noticed
here
.
<EOS>
We
lived
so
simply
and
quietly
that
the
income
which
I
was
now
steadily
earning
sufficed
for
all
our
wants
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
February
of
the
new
year
our
first
child
was
born
 
a
son
.
<EOS>
My
mother
and
sister
and
Mrs.
Vesey
were
our
guests
at
the
little
christening
party
,
and
Mrs.
Clements
was
present
to
assist
my
wife
on
the
same
occasion
.
<EOS>
Marian
was
our
boy
's
godmother
,
and
Pesca
and
Mr.
Gilmore
(
the
latter
acting
by
proxy
)
were
his
godfathers
.
<EOS>
I
may
add
here
that
when
Mr.
Gilmore
returned
to
us
a
year
later
he
assisted
the
design
of
these
pages
,
at
my
request
,
by
writing
the
Narrative
which
appears
early
in
the
story
under
his
name
,
and
which
,
though
first
in
order
of
precedence
,
was
thus
,
in
order
of
time
,
the
last
that
I
received
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
event
in
our
lives
which
now
remains
to
be
recorded
,
occurred
when
our
little
Walter
was
six
months
old
.
  
<EOS>
At
that
time
I
was
sent
to
Ireland
to
make
sketches
for
certain
forthcoming
illustrations
in
the
newspaper
to
which
I
was
attached
.
<EOS>
I
was
away
for
nearly
a
fortnight
,
corresponding
regularly
with
my
wife
and
Marian
,
except
during
the
last
three
days
of
my
absence
,
when
my
movements
were
too
uncertain
to
enable
me
to
receive
letters
.
<EOS>
I
performed
the
latter
part
of
my
journey
back
at
night
,
and
when
I
reached
home
in
the
morning
,
to
my
utter
astonishment
there
was
no
one
to
receive
me
.
<EOS>
Laura
and
Marian
and
the
child
had
left
the
house
on
the
day
before
my
return
.
  
<EOS>
A
note
from
my
wife
,
which
was
given
to
me
by
the
servant
,
only
increased
my
surprise
,
by
informing
me
that
they
had
gone
to
Limmeridge
House
.
<EOS>
Marian
had
prohibited
any
attempt
at
written
explanations
 
I
was
entreated
to
follow
them
the
moment
I
came
back
 
<EOS>
complete
enlightenment
awaited
me
on
my
arrival
in
Cumberland
 
<EOS>
and
I
was
forbidden
to
feel
the
slightest
anxiety
in
the
meantime
.
<EOS>
There
the
note
ended
.
<EOS>
It
was
still
early
enough
to
catch
the
morning
train
.
<EOS>
I
reached
Limmeridge
House
the
same
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
My
wife
and
Marian
were
both
upstairs
.
<EOS>
They
had
established
themselves
(
by
way
of
completing
my
amazement
)
in
the
little
room
which
had
been
once
assigned
to
me
for
a
studio
,
when
I
was
employed
on
Mr.
Fairlie
's
drawings
.
<EOS>
On
the
very
chair
which
I
used
to
occupy
when
I
was
at
work
Marian
was
sitting
now
,
with
the
child
industriously
sucking
his
coral
upon
her
lap
 
while
Laura
was
standing
by
the
well
-
remembered
drawing
-
table
which
I
had
so
often
used
,
with
the
little
album
that
I
had
filled
for
her
in
past
times
open
under
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
in
the
name
of
heaven
has
brought
you
here
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
"
<EOS>
Does
Mr.
Fairlie
know
 
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Marian
suspended
the
question
on
my
lips
by
telling
me
that
Mr.
Fairlie
was
dead
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
struck
by
paralysis
,
and
had
never
rallied
after
the
shock
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kyrle
had
informed
them
of
his
death
,
and
had
advised
them
to
proceed
immediately
to
Limmeridge
House
.
  
<EOS>
Some
dim
perception
of
a
great
change
dawned
on
my
mind
.
<EOS>
Laura
spoke
before
I
had
quite
realised
it
.
<EOS>
She
stole
close
to
me
to
enjoy
the
surprise
which
was
still
expressed
in
my
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
darling
Walter
,
"
she
said
,
"
must
we
really
account
for
our
boldness
in
coming
here
?
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
,
love
,
I
can
only
explain
it
by
breaking
through
our
rule
,
and
referring
to
the
past
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
not
the
least
necessity
for
doing
anything
of
the
kind
,
"
said
Marian
.
<EOS>
"
We
can
be
just
as
explicit
,
and
much
more
interesting
,
by
referring
to
the
future
.
"
<EOS>
She
rose
and
held
up
the
child
kicking
and
crowing
in
her
arms
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
who
this
is
,
Walter
?
"
she
asked
,
with
bright
tears
of
happiness
gathering
in
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Even
MY
bewilderment
has
its
limits
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
can
still
answer
for
knowing
my
own
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Child
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
with
all
her
easy
gaiety
of
old
times
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
talk
in
that
familiar
manner
of
one
of
the
landed
gentry
of
England
?
<EOS>
Are
you
aware
,
<EOS>
when
I
present
this
illustrious
baby
to
your
notice
,
in
whose
presence
you
stand
?
<EOS>
Evidently
not
!
<EOS>
Let
me
make
two
eminent
personages
known
to
one
another
:
Mr.
Walter
Hartright
 
<EOS>
THE
HEIR
OF
LIMMERIDGE
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
she
spoke
.
<EOS>
In
writing
those
last
words
,
I
have
written
all
.
<EOS>
The
pen
falters
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
The
long
,
happy
labour
of
many
months
is
over
.
<EOS>
Marian
was
the
good
angel
of
our
lives
 
<EOS>
let
Marian
end
our
Story
.
   
<EOS>
