these

nothing

The
scene
was
a
plain
,
bare
,
monotonous
vault
of
a
school
-
room
,
and
the
speaker
's
square
forefinger
emphasized
his
observations
by
underscoring
every
sentence
with
a
line
on
the
schoolmaster
's
sleeve
.
 
<EOS>
The
emphasis
was
helped
by
the
speaker
's
square
wall
of
a
forehead
,
which
had
his
eyebrows
for
its
base
,
while
his
eyes
found
commodious
cellarage
in
two
dark
caves
,
overshadowed
by
the
wall
.
<EOS>
The
emphasis
was
helped
by
the
speaker
's
mouth
,
which
was
wide
,
thin
,
and
hard
set
.
 
<EOS>
The
emphasis
was
helped
by
the
speaker
's
voice
,
which
was
inflexible
,
dry
,
and
dictatorial
.
 
<EOS>
The
emphasis
was
helped
by
the
speaker
's
hair
,
which
bristled
on
the
skirts
of
his
bald
head
,
a
plantation
of
firs
to
keep
the
wind
from
its
shining
surface
,
all
covered
with
knobs
,
like
the
crust
of
a
plum
pie
,
as
if
the
head
had
scarcely
warehouse
-
room
for
the
hard
facts
stored
inside
.
 
<EOS>
The
speaker
's
obstinate
carriage
,
square
coat
,
square
legs
,
square
shoulders
,
---
nay
,
his
very
neckcloth
,
trained
to
take
him
by
the
throat
with
an
unaccommodating
grasp
,
like
a
stubborn
fact
,
as
it
was
,
---
all
helped
the
emphasis
.

"

The
speaker
,
and
the
schoolmaster
,
and
the
third
grown
person
present
,
all
backed
a
little
,
and
swept
with
their
eyes
the
inclined
plane
of
little
vessels
then
and
there
arranged
in
order
,
ready
to
have
imperial
gallons
of
facts
poured
into
them

they

full

With
a
rule

a

of
scales

the
multiplication
table
always
in
his

ready
to
weigh

measure
any
parcel
of
human
nature

and
tell
you
exactly
what
it
comes
to

<EOS>
It
is
a
mere
question
of
figures

a
case
of
simple
arithmetic

You

no

In
such
terms
Mr
Gradgrind
always
mentally
introduced
himself
,
whether
to
his
private
circle
of
acquaintance
,
or
to
the
public
in
general

<EOS>
In
such

words

Thomas
Gradgrind
now
presented
Thomas
Gradgrind
to
the
little
pitchers
before
him
,
who
were
to
be
filled
so
full
of
facts
.
   
<EOS>
Indeed
,
as
he
eagerly
sparkled
at
them
from
the
cellarage
before
mentioned
,
he
seemed
a
kind
of
cannon
loaded
to
the
muzzle
with
facts
,
and
prepared
to
blow
them
clean
out
of
the
regions
of
childhood
at
one
discharge
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
a
galvanizing
apparatus
,
too
,
charged
with
a
grim
mechanical
substitute
for
the
tender
young
imaginations
that
were
to
be
stormed
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
Girl

twenty

said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
squarely
pointing
with
his
square
forefinger
,
"
I

<EOS>
Who
is

"
   
<EOS>
"
Sissy

explained

blushing
,
standing
up
,
and
curtseying
.

"

said
Mr

"
Do

"
It

returned
the
young
girl
in
a
trembling
voice
,
and
with
another
curtsey
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
he
has
no
business
to
do
it

said
Mr

<EOS>
"
Tell

He

riding

<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
frowned
,
and
waved
off
the
objectionable
calling
with
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
do
n't
want

<EOS>
"
If
you
please

<EOS>
(
Sissy
Jupe
thrown
into
the
greatest
alarm
by
this
demand
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
Girl
number
twenty
unable
to
define

"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
for
the
general
behoof
of
all
the
little
pitchers
.
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
Bitzer
,
yours
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
square
finger
,
moving
here
and
there
,
lighted
suddenly
on
Bitzer
,
perhaps
because
he
chanced
to
sit
in
the
same
ray
of
sunlight
which
,
darting
in
at
one
of
the
bare
windows
of
the
intensely
white
-
washed
room
,
irradiated
Sissy
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
the
boys
and
girls
sat
on
the
face
of
the
inclined
plane
in
two
compact
bodies
,
divided
up
the
centre
by
a
narrow
interval
;
and
Sissy
,
being
at
the
corner
of
a
row
on
the
sunny
side
,
came
in
for
the
beginning
of
a
sunbeam
,
of
which
Bitzer
,
being
at
the
corner
of
a
row
on
the
other
side
,
a
few
rows
in
advance
,
caught
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
whereas
the
girl
was
so
dark
-
eyed
and
dark
-
haired
,
that
she
seemed
to
receive
a
deeper
and
more
lustrous
colour
from
the
sun
<EOS>
,
when
it
shone
upon
her
,
the
boy
was
so
light
-
eyed
and
light
-
haired
that
the
self
-
same
rays
appeared
to
draw
out
of
him
what
little
colour
he
ever
possessed
.
 
<EOS>
His
cold
eyes
would
hardly
have
been
eyes
,
but
for
the
short
ends
of
lashes
which
,
by
bringing
them
into
immediate
contrast
with
something
paler
than
themselves
,
expressed
their
form
.
 
<EOS>
His
short
-
cropped
hair
might
have
been
a
mere
continuation
of
the
sandy
freckles
on
his
forehead
and
face
.
 
<EOS>
His
skin
was
so
unwholesomely
deficient
in
the
natural
tinge
,
that
he
looked
as
though
,
if
he
were
cut
,
he
would
bleed
white
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bitzer

said
Thomas
Gradgrind

<EOS>
"

(

more
)
Bitzer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now

number
twenty
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
a
horse
is

"
   
<EOS>
She
curtseyed
again
,
and
would
have
blushed
deeper
,
if
she
could
have
blushed
deeper
than
she
had
blushed
all
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
Bitzer
,
after
rapidly
blinking
at
Thomas
Gradgrind
with
both
eyes
at
once
,
and
so
catching
the
light
upon
his
quivering
ends
of
lashes
that
they
looked
like
the
antennae
of
busy
insects
,
put
his
knuckles
to
his
freckled
forehead
,
and
sat
down
again
.
   
<EOS>
The
third
gentleman
now
stepped
forth
.
 
<EOS>
A
mighty
man
at
cutting
and
drying
,
he
was
;
a
government
officer
;
in
his
way
(
and
in
most
other
people
's
too
)
,
a
professed
pugilist
;
always
in
training
,
always
with
a
system
to
force
down
the
general
throat
like
a
bolus
,
always
to
be
heard
of
at
the
bar
of
his
little
Public
-
office
,
ready
to
fight
all
England
.
 
<EOS>
To
continue
in
fistic
phraseology
,
he
had
a
genius
for
coming
up
to
the
scratch
,
wherever
and
whatever
it
was
,
and
proving
himself
an
ugly
customer
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
go
in
and
damage
any
subject
whatever
with
his
right
,
follow
up
with
his
left
,
stop
,
exchange
,
counter
,
bore
his
opponent
(
he
always
fought
All
England
)
to
the
ropes
,
and
fall
upon
him
neatly
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
certain
to
knock
the
wind
out
of
common
sense
,
and
render
that
unlucky
adversary
deaf
to
the
call
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
had
it
in
charge
from
high
authority
to
bring
about
the
great
public
-
office
Millennium
,
when
Commissioners
should
reign
upon
earth
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well
,
"
said
this
gentleman
,
briskly
smiling
,
and
folding
his
arms
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
horse
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
let
me
ask
you
girls
and
boys
,
Would
you
paper
a
room
with
representations
of
horses
?
"
   
<EOS>
After
a
pause
,
one
half
of
the
children
cried
in
chorus
,
"
Yes
,
sir
!
"
 
<EOS>
Upon
which
the
other
half
,
seeing
in
the
gentleman
's
face
that
Yes
was
wrong
,
cried
out
in
chorus
,
"
No
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
---
as
the
custom
is
,
in
these
examinations
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
,
No
.
 
<EOS>
Why
would
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
A
pause
.
 
<EOS>
One
corpulent
slow
boy
,
with
a
wheezy
manner
of
breathing
,
ventured
the
answer
,
Because
he
would
n't
paper
a
room
at
all
,
but
would
paint
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
paper
it
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
rather
warmly
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
paper
it
,
"
said
Thomas
Gradgrind
,
"
<EOS>
whether
you
like
it
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
tell
us
you
would
n't
paper
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
,
boy
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
explain
to
you
,
then
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
after
another
and
a
dismal
pause
,
"
why
you
would
n't
paper
a
room
with
representations
of
horses
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
ever
see
horses
walking
up
and
down
the
sides
of
rooms
in
reality
---
in
fact
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
from
one
half
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
from
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
no
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
with
an
indignant
look
at
the
wrong
half
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
,
you
are
not
to
see
anywhere
,
what
you
do
n't
see
in
fact
;
you
are
not
to
have
anywhere
,
what
you
do
n't
have
in
fact
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
called
Taste
,
is
only
another
name
for
Fact
.
"
 
<EOS>
Thomas
Gradgrind
nodded
his
approbation
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
new
principle
,
a
discovery
,
a
great
discovery
,
"
said
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
'll
try
you
again
.
 
<EOS>
Suppose
you
were
going
to
carpet
a
room
.
 
<EOS>
Would
you
use
a
carpet
having
a
representation
of
flowers
upon
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
There
being
a
general
conviction
by
this
time
that
"
No
,
sir
!
"
was
always
the
right
answer
to
this
gentleman
,
the
chorus
of
NO
was
very
strong
.
 
<EOS>
Only
a
few
feeble
stragglers
said
Yes
:
 
among
them
Sissy
Jupe
.
   
<EOS>
"
Girl
number
twenty
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
smiling
in
the
calm
strength
of
knowledge
.
   
<EOS>
Sissy
blushed
,
and
stood
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
you
would
carpet
your
room
---
or
your
husband
's
room
,
if
you
were
a
grown
woman
,
and
had
a
husband
---
with
representations
of
flowers
,
would
you
?
"
said
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
would
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
sir
,
I
am
very
fond
of
flowers
,
"
returned
the
girl
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
is
that
why
you
would
put
tables
and
chairs
upon
them
,
and
have
people
walking
over
them
with
heavy
boots
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
n't
hurt
them
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
n't
crush
and
wither
,
if
you
please
,
sir

<EOS>
They

fancy

"
Ay

ay

<EOS>
But
you
must
n't
fancy

"
cried
the
gentleman
,
quite
elated
by
coming
so
happily
to
his
point
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
it

<EOS>
You
are
never

fancy

<EOS>

You

Cecilia

Thomas

solemnly
repeated

"
to

anything

kind

"
   
<EOS>
"
Fact

said

<EOS>
And
"
Fact

fact

"
repeated
Thomas

<EOS>
"
You
are
to

all

regulated

said
the

,
"
by

<EOS>
We
hope
to
have
,
before
long
,
a
board
of
fact
,
composed
of
commissioners
of
fact
,
who
will
force
the
people
to
be
a
people
of
fact
,
and
of
nothing
but
fact
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
discard
the
word
Fancy
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
not
to
have
,
in
any
object
of
use
or
ornament
,
what
would
be
a
contradiction
in
fact
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
walk
upon
flowers
in
fact
;
you
can
not
be
allowed
to
walk
upon
flowers
in
carpets
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
find
that
foreign
birds
and
butterflies
come
and
perch
upon
your
crockery
;
you
can
not
be
permitted
to
paint
foreign
birds
and
butterflies
upon
your
crockery
.
 
<EOS>
You
never
meet
with
quadrupeds
going
up
and
down
walls
;
you
must
not
have
quadrupeds
represented
upon
walls
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
use
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
"
for
all
these
purposes
,
combinations
and
modifications
(
in
primary
colours
)
of
mathematical
figures
which
are
susceptible
of
proof
and
demonstration
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
new
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
fact

<EOS>
This
is
taste

"
   
<EOS>
The
girl
curtseyed
,
and
sat
down
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
very
young
,
and
she
looked
as
if
she
were
frightened
by
the
matter

of

fact
prospect
the
world
afforded

<EOS>
"
Now
,
if
Mr
M'Choakumchild
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
"
will
proceed
to
give
his
first
lesson
here
,
Mr
Gradgrind
,
I
shall
be
happy
,
at
your
request
,
to
observe
his
mode
of
procedure
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
was
much
obliged
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
M'Choakumchild
,
we
only
wait
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
,
Mr
M'Choakumchild
began
in
his
best
manner
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
some
one
hundred
and
forty
other
schoolmasters
,
had
been
lately
turned
at
the
same
time
,
in
the
same
factory
,
on
the
same
principles
,
like
so
many
pianoforte
legs
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
put
through
an
immense
variety
of
paces
,
and
had
answered
volumes
of
head
-
breaking
questions
.
<EOS>
Orthography
,
etymology
,
syntax
,
and
prosody
,
biography
,
astronomy
,
geography
,
and
general
cosmography
,
the
sciences
of
compound
proportion
,
algebra
,
land
-
surveying
and
levelling
,
vocal
music
,
and
drawing
from
models
,
were
all
at
the
ends
of
his
ten
chilled
fingers
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
worked
his
stony
way
into
Her
Majesty
's
most
Honourable
Privy
Council
's
Schedule
B^
,
and
had
taken
the
bloom
off
the
higher
branches
of
mathematics
and
physical
science
,
French
,
German
,
Latin
,
and
Greek
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
all
about
all
the
Water
Sheds
of
all
the
world
(
whatever
they
are
)
,
and
all
the
histories
of
all
the
peoples
,
and
all
the
names
of
all
the
rivers
and
mountains
,
and
all
the
productions
,
manners
,
and
customs
of
all
the
countries
,
and
all
their
boundaries
and
bearings
on
the
two
and
thirty
points
of
the
compass
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
rather
overdone
,
M'Choakumchild
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
only
learnt
a
little
less
,
how
infinitely
better
he
might
have
taught
much
more
!
   
<EOS>
He
went
to
work
in
this
preparatory
lesson
,
not
unlike
Morgiana
in
the
Forty
Thieves
:
 
looking
into
all
the
vessels
ranged
before
him
,
one
after
another
,
to
see
what
they
contained
.
 
<EOS>
Say
,
good
M'Choakumchild
.
 
<EOS>
When
from
thy
boiling
store
,
thou
shalt
fill
each
jar
brim
full
by
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
,
dost
thou
think
that
thou
wilt
always
kill
outright
the
robber
Fancy
lurking
within
---
or
sometimes
only
maim
him
and
distort
him
!

Chapter

<EOS>
A
Loophole
 
Mr
Gradgrind
walked
homeward
from
the
school
,
in
a
state
of
considerable
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
his
school
,
and
he
intended
it
to
be
a
model
.
 
<EOS>
He
intended
every
child
in
it
to
be
a
model
---
just
as
the
young
Gradgrinds
were
all
models
.
   
<EOS>
There
were
five
young
Gradgrinds
,
and
they
were
models
every
one
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
lectured
at
,
from
their
tenderest
years
;
coursed
,
like
little
hares
.
 
<EOS>
Almost
as
soon
as
they
could
run
alone
,
they
had
been
made
to
run
to
the
lecture
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
object
with
which
they
had
an
association
,
or
of
which
they
had
a
remembrance
,
was
a
large
black
board
with
a
dry
Ogre
chalking
ghastly
white
figures
on
it
.
   
<EOS>
Not
that
they
knew
,
by
name
or
nature
,
anything
about
an
Ogre
Fact
forbid
!
 
<EOS>
I
only
use
the
word
to
express
a
monster
in
a
lecturing
castle
,
with
Heaven
knows
how
many
heads
manipulated
into
one
,
taking
childhood
captive
,
and
dragging
it
into
gloomy
statistical
dens
by
the
hair
.
   
<EOS>
No
little
Gradgrind
had
ever
seen
a
face
in
the
moon
;
it
was
up
in
the
moon
before
it
could
speak
distinctly
.
 
<EOS>
No
little
Gradgrind
had
ever
learnt
the
silly
jingle
,
Twinkle
,
twinkle
,
little
star
;
how
I
wonder
what
you
are
!
 
<EOS>
No
little
Gradgrind
had
ever
known
wonder
on
the
subject
<EOS>
,
each
little
Gradgrind
having
at
five
years
old
dissected
the
Great
Bear
like
a
Professor
Owen
,
and
driven
Charles
's
Wain
like
a
locomotive
engine
-
driver
.
 
<EOS>
No
little
Gradgrind
had
ever
associated
a
cow
in
a
field
with
that
famous
cow
with
the
crumpled
horn
who
tossed
the
dog
who
worried
the
cat
who
killed
the
rat
who
ate
the
malt
,
or
with
that
yet
more
famous
cow
who
swallowed
Tom
Thumb
:
 
<EOS>
it
had
never
heard
of
those
celebrities
,
and
had
only
been
introduced
to
a
cow
as
a
graminivorous
ruminating
quadruped
with
several
stomachs
.
   
<EOS>
To
his
matter
-
of
-
fact
home
,
which
was
called
Stone
Lodge
,
Mr
Gradgrind
directed
his
steps
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
virtually
retired
from
the
wholesale
hardware
trade
before
he
built
Stone
Lodge
,
and
was
now
looking
about
for
a
suitable
opportunity
of
making
an
arithmetical
figure
in
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
Stone
Lodge
was
situated
on
a
moor
within
a
mile
or
two
of
a
great
town
---
called
Coketown
in
the
present
faithful
guide
-
book
.
   
<EOS>
A
very
regular
feature
on
the
face
of
the
country
,
Stone
Lodge
was
.
<EOS>
Not
the
least
disguise
toned
down
or
shaded
off
that
uncompromising
fact
in
the
landscape
.
 
<EOS>
A
great
square
house
,
with
a
heavy
portico
darkening
the
principal
windows
,
as
its
master
's
heavy
brows
overshadowed
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
A
calculated
,
cast
up
,
balanced
,
and
proved
house
.
 
<EOS>
Six
windows
on
this
side
of
the
door
,
six
on
that
side
;
a
total
of
twelve
in
this
wing
,
a
total
of
twelve
in
the
other
wing
;
<EOS>
four
-
and
-
twenty
carried
over
to
the
back
wings
.
 
<EOS>
A
lawn
and
garden
and
an
infant
avenue
,
all
ruled
straight
like
a
botanical
account
-
book
.
 
<EOS>
Gas
and
ventilation
,
drainage
and
water
-
service
,
all
of
the
primest
quality
.
 
<EOS>
Iron
clamps
and
girders
,
fire
-
proof
from
top
to
bottom
;
mechanical
lifts
for
the
housemaids
,
with
all
their
brushes
and
brooms
;
everything
that
heart
could
desire
.
   
<EOS>
Everything
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
suppose
so
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
Gradgrinds
had
cabinets
in
various
departments
of
science
too
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
a
little
conchological
cabinet
,
and
a
little
metallurgical
cabinet
,
and
a
little
mineralogical
cabinet
;
and
the
specimens
were
all
arranged
and
labelled
,
and
the
bits
of
stone
and
ore
looked
as
though
they
might
have
been
broken
from
the
parent
substances
by
those
tremendously
hard
instruments
their
own
names
;
and
,
to
paraphrase
the
idle
legend
of
Peter
Piper
,
who
had
never
found
his
way
into
their
nursery
,
<EOS>
If
the
greedy
little
Gradgrinds
grasped
at
more
than
this
,
what
was
it
for
good
gracious
goodness
'
sake
,
that
the
greedy
little
Gradgrinds
grasped
it
!
   
<EOS>
Their
father
walked
on
in
a
hopeful
and
satisfied
frame
of
mind
.
<EOS>
He
was
an
affectionate
father
,
after
his
manner
;
but
he
would
probably
have
described
himself
(
if
he
had
been
put
,
like
Sissy
Jupe
,
upon
a
definition
)
as
"
an
eminently
practical
"
father
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
particular
pride
in
the
phrase
eminently
practical
,
which
was
considered
to
have
a
special
application
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Whatsoever
the
public
meeting
held
in
Coketown
,
and
whatsoever
the
subject
of
such
meeting
,
some
Coketowner
was
sure
to
seize
the
occasion
of
alluding
to
his
eminently
practical
friend
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
This
always
pleased
the
eminently
practical
friend
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
it
to
be
his
due
,
but
his
due
was
acceptable
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
reached
the
neutral
ground
upon
the
outskirts
of
the
town
,
which
was
neither
town
nor
country
,
and
yet
was
either
spoiled
,
when
his
ears
were
invaded
by
the
sound
of
music
.
 
<EOS>
The
clashing
and
banging
band
attached
to
the
horse
-
riding
establishment
,
which
had
there
set
up
its
rest
in
a
wooden
pavilion
,
was
in
full
bray
.
 
<EOS>
A
flag
,
floating
from
the
summit
of
the
temple
,
proclaimed
to
mankind
that
it
was
"
Sleary
's
Horse
-
riding
"
which
claimed
their
suffrages
.
<EOS>
Sleary
himself
,
a
stout
modern
statue
with
a
money
-
box
at
its
elbow
,
in
an
ecclesiastical
niche
of
early
Gothic
architecture
,
took
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Josephine
Sleary
,
as
some
very
long
and
very
narrow
strips
of
printed
bill
announced
,
was
then
inaugurating
the
entertainments
with
her
graceful
equestrian
Tyrolean
flower
-
act
.
<EOS>
Among
the
other
pleasing
but
always
strictly
moral
wonders
which
must
be
seen
to
be
believed
,
Signor
Jupe
was
that
afternoon
to
"
elucidate
the
diverting
accomplishments
of
his
highly
trained
performing
dog
Merrylegs
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
was
also
to
exhibit
"
his
astounding
feat
of
throwing
seventy
-
five
hundred
-
weight
in
rapid
succession
backhanded
over
his
head
,
thus
forming
a
fountain
of
solid
iron
in
mid
-
air
,
a
feat
never
before
attempted
in
this
or
any
other
country
,
and
which
having
elicited
such
rapturous
plaudits
from
enthusiastic
throngs
it
can
not
be
withdrawn
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
same
Signor
Jupe
was
to
"
enliven
the
varied
performances
at
frequent
intervals
with
his
chaste
Shaksperean
quips
and
retorts
.
"
 
<EOS>
Lastly
,
he
was
to
wind
them
up
by
appearing
in
his
favourite
character
of
Mr
William
Button
,
of
Tooley
Street
,
in
"
the
highly
novel
and
laughable
hippo
-
comedietta
of
The
Tailor
's
Journey
to
Brentford
.
"
   
<EOS>
Thomas
Gradgrind
took
no
heed
of
these
trivialities
of
course
,
but
passed
on
as
a
practical
man
ought
to
pass
on
,
either
brushing
the
noisy
insects
from
his
thoughts
,
or
consigning
them
to
the
House
of
Correction
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
turning
of
the
road
took
him
by
the
back
of
the
booth
,
and
at
the
back
of
the
booth
a
number
of
children
were
congregated
in
a
number
of
stealthy
attitudes
,
striving
to
peep
in
at
the
hidden
glories
of
the
place
.
   
<EOS>
This
brought
him
to
a
stop
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
to
think
of
these
vagabonds
,
"
said
he
,
"
attracting
the
young
rabble
from
a
model
school
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
space
of
stunted
grass
and
dry
rubbish
being
between
him
and
the
young
rabble
,
he
took
his
eyeglass
out
of
his
waistcoat
to
look
for
any
child
he
knew
by
name
,
and
might
order
off
.
 
<EOS>
Phenomenon
almost
incredible
though
distinctly
seen
,
what
did
he
then
behold
but
his
own
metallurgical
Louisa
,
peeping
with
all
her
might
through
a
hole
in
a
deal
board
,
and
his
own
mathematical
Thomas
abasing
himself
on
the
ground
to
catch
but
a
hoof
of
the
graceful
equestrian
Tyrolean
flower
-
act
!
   
<EOS>
Dumb
with
amazement
,
Mr
Gradgrind
crossed
to
the
spot
where
his
family
was
thus
disgraced
,
laid
his
hand
upon
each
erring
child
,
and
said
:
   
"
Louisa
!
!
 
<EOS>
Thomas
!
!
"
   
<EOS>
Both
rose
,
red
and
disconcerted
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Louisa
looked
at
her
father
with
more
boldness
than
Thomas
did
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Thomas
did
not
look
at
him
,
but
gave
himself
up
to
be
taken
home
like
a
machine
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
name
of
wonder
,
idleness
,
and
folly
!
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
leading
each
away
by
a
hand
;
"
what
do
you
do
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wanted
to
see
what
it
was
like
,
"
returned
Louisa
,
shortly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
it
was
like
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Yes
,
father
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
an
air
of
jaded
sullenness
in
them
both
,
and
particularly
in
the
girl
:
 
yet
,
struggling
through
the
dissatisfaction
of
her
face
,
there
was
a
light
with
nothing
to
rest
upon
,
a
fire
with
nothing
to
burn
,
a
starved
imagination
keeping
life
in
itself
somehow
,
which
brightened
its
expression
.
 
<EOS>
Not
with
the
brightness
natural
to
cheerful
youth
,
but
with
uncertain
,
eager
,
doubtful
flashes
,
which
had
something
painful
in
them
,
analogous
to
the
changes
on
a
blind
face
groping
its
way
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
a
child
now
,
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
;
but
at
no
distant
day
would
seem
to
become
a
woman
all
at
once

Her
father
thought
so
as
he
looked
at
her

<EOS>
She
was
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
Would
have
been
self
-
willed
(
he
thought
in
his
eminently
practical
way
)
<EOS>
but
for
her
bringing

up

<EOS>
"
Thomas
,
though
I
have
the
fact
before
me
,
I
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
you
,
with
your
education
and
resources
,
should
have
brought
your
sister
to
a
scene
like
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
brought
him
,
father
,
"
said
Louisa
,
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
asked
him
to
come
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
sorry
indeed
to
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
makes
Thomas
no
better
,
and
it
makes
you
worse
,
Louisa
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
looked
at
her
father
again
,
but
no
tear
fell
down
her
cheek
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
!
 
<EOS>
Thomas
and
you
,
to
whom
the
circle
of
the
sciences
is
open
;
Thomas
and
you
,
who
may
be
said
to
be
replete
with
facts
;
Thomas
and
you
,
who
have
been
trained
to
mathematical
exactness
;
Thomas
and
you
,
here
!
"
cried
Mr
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
this
degraded
position
!
<EOS>
I
am
amazed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
tired
,
father
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
tired
a
long
time
,
"
said
Louisa
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tired
?
 
<EOS>
Of
what
?
"
asked
the
astonished
father
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
of
what
---
of
everything
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Say
not
another
word
,
"
returned
Mr
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
childish
.
<EOS>
I
will
hear
no
more
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
speak
again
until
they
had
walked
some
half
-
a
-
mile
in
silence
,
when
he
gravely
broke
out
with
:
 
<EOS>
"
What
would
your
best
friends
say
,
Louisa
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
attach
no
value
to
their
good
opinion
?
 
<EOS>
What
would
Mr
Bounderby
say
?
"
 
<EOS>
At
the
mention
of
this
name
,
his
daughter
stole
a
look
at
him
,
remarkable
for
its
intense
and
searching
character
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
nothing
of
it
,
for
before
he
looked
at
her
,
she
had
again
cast
down
her
eyes
!
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
"
he
repeated
presently
,
"
would
Mr
Bounderby
say
?
<EOS>
"
 
All
the
way
to
Stone
Lodge
,
as
with
grave
indignation
he
led
the
two
delinquents
home
,
he
repeated
at
intervals
<EOS>
"
What
would
Mr
Bounderby
say
?
"
<EOS>
---
as
if
Mr
Bounderby
had
been
Mrs
Grundy
.

<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
 
Not
being
Mrs
Grundy
,
<EOS>
who
was
Mr
Bounderby
?
   
<EOS>
Why
,
Mr
Bounderby
was
as
near
being
Mr
Gradgrind
's
bosom
friend
,
as
a
man
perfectly
devoid
of
sentiment
can
approach
that
spiritual
relationship
towards
another
man
perfectly
devoid
of
sentiment
.
 
<EOS>
So
near
was
Mr
Bounderby
---
or
,
if
the
reader
should
prefer
it
,
so
far
off
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
a
rich
man
:
 
banker
,
merchant
,
manufacturer
,
and
what
<EOS>
not
.
<EOS>
A
big
,
loud
man
,
with
a
stare
,
and
a
metallic
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
made
out
of
a
coarse
material
,
which
seemed
to
have
been
stretched
to
make
so
much
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
with
a
great
puffed
head
and
forehead
,
swelled
veins
in
his
temples
,
and
such
a
strained
skin
to
his
face
that
it
seemed
to
hold
his
eyes
open
,
and
lift
his
eyebrows
up
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
with
a
pervading
appearance
on
him
of
being
inflated
like
a
balloon
,
and
ready
to
start
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
who
could
never
sufficiently
vaunt
himself
a
self
-
made
man
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
who
was
always
proclaiming
,
through
that
brassy
speaking
-
trumpet
of
a
voice
of
his
,
his
old
ignorance
and
his
old
poverty
.
 
<EOS>
A
man
who
was
the
Bully
of
humility
.
   
<EOS>
A
year
or
two
younger
than
his
eminently
practical
friend
,
Mr
Bounderby
looked
older
;
his
seven
or
eight
and
forty
might
have
had
the
seven
or
eight
added
to
it
again
,
without
surprising
anybody
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
much
hair
.
 
<EOS>
One
might
have
fancied
he
had
talked
it
off
;
and
that
what
was
left
,
all
standing
up
in
disorder
,
was
in
that
condition
from
being
constantly
blown
about
by
his
windy
boastfulness
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
formal
drawing
-
room
of
Stone
Lodge
,
standing
on
the
hearthrug
,
warming
himself
before
the
fire
,
Mr
Bounderby
delivered
some
observations
to
Mrs
Gradgrind
on
the
circumstance
of
its
being
his
birthday
.
 
<EOS>
He
stood
before
the
fire
,
partly
because
it
was
a
cool
spring
afternoon
,
though
the
sun
shone
;
partly
because
the
shade
of
Stone
Lodge
was
always
haunted
by
the
ghost
of
damp
mortar
;
partly
because
he
thus
took
up
a
commanding
position
,
from
which
to
subdue
Mrs
Gradgrind
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
n't
a
shoe
to
my
foot
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
a
stocking
,
I
did
n't
know
such
a
thing
by
name
.
 
<EOS>
I
passed
the
day
in
a
ditch
,
and
the
night
in
a
pigsty
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
the
way
I
spent
my
tenth
birthday
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
a
ditch
was
new
to
me
,
for
I
was
born
in
a
ditch
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gradgrind
,
a
little
,
thin
,
white
,
pink
-
eyed
bundle
of
shawls
,
of
surpassing
feebleness
,
mental
and
bodily
;
who
was
always
taking
physic
without
any
effect
,
and
who
,
whenever
she
showed
a
symptom
of
coming
to
life
,
was
invariably
stunned
by
some
weighty
piece
of
fact
tumbling
on
her
<EOS>
;
Mrs
Gradgrind
hoped
it
was
a
dry
ditch
?
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
As
wet
as
a
sop
.
 
<EOS>
A
foot
of
water
in
it
,
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
.
   
<EOS>
"
Enough
to
give
a
baby
cold
,
"
Mrs
Gradgrind
considered
.
   
<EOS>
"
Cold
?
 
<EOS>
I
was
born
with
inflammation
of
the
lungs
,
and
of
everything
else
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
that
was
capable
of
inflammation
,
"
returned
Mr
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
years
,
ma'am
,
I
was
one
of
the
most
miserable
little
wretches
ever
seen
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
sickly
,
that
I
was
always
moaning
and
groaning
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
ragged
and
dirty
,
that
you
would
n't
have
touched
me
with
a
pair
of
tongs
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gradgrind
faintly
looked
at
the
tongs
,
as
the
most
appropriate
thing
her
imbecility
could
think
of
doing
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
I
fought
through
it
,
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
determined
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
a
determined
character
in
later
life
,
and
I
suppose
I
was
then
.
 
<EOS>
Here
I
am
,
Mrs
Gradgrind
,
anyhow
,
and
nobody
to
thank
for
my
being
here
,
but
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gradgrind
meekly
and
weakly
hoped
that
his
mother
---
   
"
My
mother
?
 
<EOS>
Bolted
,
ma'am
!
<EOS>
"
said
Bounderby
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gradgrind
,
stunned
as
usual
,
collapsed
and
gave
it
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
mother
left
me
to
my
grandmother
,
"
said
Bounderby
;
"
and
,
according
to
the
best
of
my
remembrance
,
my
grandmother
was
the
wickedest
and
the
worst
old
woman
that
ever
lived
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
got
a
little
pair
of
shoes
by
any
chance
,
she
would
take
'em
off
and
sell
'em
for
drink
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
have
known
that
grandmother
of
mine
lie
in
her
bed
and
drink
her
four
-
teen
glasses
of
liquor
before
breakfast
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Gradgrind
,
weakly
smiling
,
and
giving
no
other
sign
of
vitality
,
looked
(
as
she
always
did
)
like
an
indifferently
executed
transparency
of
a
small
female
figure
,
without
enough
light
behind
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
kept
a
chandler
's
shop
,
"
pursued
Bounderby
,
"
and
kept
me
in
an
egg
-
box
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
the
cot
of
my
infancy
;
an
old
egg
-
box
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
was
big
enough
to
run
away
,
of
course
I
ran
away
.
 
<EOS>
Then
I
became
a
young
vagabond
;
and
instead
of
one
old
woman
knocking
me
about
and
starving
me
,
everybody
of
all
ages
knocked
me
about
and
starved
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
right
;
they
had
no
business
to
do
anything
else
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
a
nuisance
,
an
incumbrance
,
and
a
pest
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
His
pride
in
having
at
any
time
of
his
life
achieved
such
a
great
social
distinction
as
to
be
a
nuisance
,
an
incumbrance
,
and
a
pest
,
was
only
to
be
satisfied
by
three
sonorous
repetitions
of
the
boast
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
to
pull
through
it
,
I
suppose
,
Mrs
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
I
was
to
do
it
or
<EOS>
not
,
ma'am
,
I
did
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
pulled
through
it

though
nobody
threw
me
out
a
rope

Those
are
the
antecedents
,
and
the
culmination

<EOS>
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
learnt
his
letters
from
the
outsides
of
the
shops
,
Mrs
Gradgrind
,
and
was
first
able
to
tell
the
time
upon
a
dial
-
plate
,
from
studying
the
steeple
clock
of
St.
Giles
's
Church
,
London
,
under
the
direction
of
a
drunken
cripple
,
who
was
a
convicted
thief
,
and
an
incorrigible
vagrant
.
<EOS>
Tell
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
,
of
your
district
schools
and
your
model
schools
,
and
your
training
schools
,
and
your
whole
kettle

fish
of
schools

and
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
,
tells
you
plainly
,
all
right

all
correct

he
had
n't
such
advantages

but
let
us
have
hard

solid

fisted
people

the
education
that
made
him
wo
n't
do
for
everybody

well

his
education
was

however

"
   
<EOS>
Being
heated
when
he
arrived
at
this
climax
,
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
He
stopped
just
as
his
eminently
practical
friend
,
still
accompanied
by
the
two
young
culprits
,
entered
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
His
eminently
practical
friend
,
on
seeing
him
,
stopped
also
,
and
gave
Louisa
a
reproachful
look
that
plainly
said
,
"
Behold
your
Bounderby
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
blustered
Mr
Bounderby
,
"
what
's
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
young
Thomas
in
the
dumps
about
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
spoke
of
young
Thomas
,
but
he
looked
at
Louisa
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
were
peeping
at
the
circus
,
"
muttered
Louisa
,
haughtily
,
without
lifting
up
her
eyes
,
"
and
father
caught
us
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
,
Mrs
Gradgrind
,
"
said
her
husband
in
a
lofty
manner
,
"
I
should
as
soon
have
expected
to
find
my
children
reading
poetry
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
"
whimpered
Mrs
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
,
Louisa
and
Thomas
!
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
at
you

<EOS>
I
declare
you
're
enough
to
make
one
regret
ever
having
had
a
family
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
mind
to
say
I
wish
I
had
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Then
what
would
you
have
done
,
I
should
like
to
know
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
did
not
seem
favourably
impressed
by
these
cogent
remarks
.
 
<EOS>
He
frowned
impatiently
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
if
,
with
my
head
in
its
present
throbbing
state
,
you
could
n't
go
and
look
at
the
shells
and
minerals
and
things
provided
for
you
,
instead
of
circuses
!
"
said
Mrs
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
<EOS>
as
well
as
I
do
,
no
young
people
have
circus
masters
,
or
keep
circuses
in
cabinets
,
or
attend
lectures
about
circuses
.
 
<EOS>
What
can
you
possibly
want
to
know
of
circuses
then
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
have
enough
to
do
,
if
that
's
what
you
want
.
 
<EOS>
With
my
head
in
its
present
state
,
I
could
n't
remember
the
mere
names
of
half
the
facts
you
have
got
to
attend
to
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
reason
!
"
<EOS>
pouted
Louisa
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
tell
me
that
's
the
reason
,
because
it
ca
n't
be
nothing
of
the
sort
,
"
said
Mrs
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
and
be
something
-
ological
directly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gradgrind
was
not
a
scientific
character
,
and
usually
dismissed
her
children
to
their
studies
with
this
general
injunction
to
choose
their
pursuit
.
   
<EOS>
In
truth
,
Mrs
Gradgrind
's
stock
of
facts
in
general
was
woefully
defective
;
but
Mr
Gradgrind
in
raising
her
to
her
high
matrimonial
position
,
had
been
influenced
by
two
reasons
.
 
<EOS>
Firstly
,
she
was
most
satisfactory
as
a
question
of
figures
;
and
,
secondly
,
she
had
"
no
nonsense
"
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
By
nonsense
he
meant
fancy
;
and
truly
it
is
probable
<EOS>
she
was
as
free
from
any
alloy
of
that
nature
,
as
any
human
being
not
arrived
at
the
perfection
of
an
absolute
idiot
,
ever
was
.
   
<EOS>
The
simple
circumstance
of
being
left
alone
with
her
husband
and
Mr
Bounderby
,
was
sufficient
to
stun
this
admirable
lady
again
without
collision
between
herself
and
any
other
fact
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
she
once
more
died
away
,
and
nobody
minded
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bounderby
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
drawing
a
chair
to
the
fireside
,
"
you
are
always
so
interested
in
my
young
people
---
particularly
in
Louisa
---
that
I
make
no
apology
for
saying
to
you
,
I
am
very
much
vexed
by
this
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
systematically
devoted
myself
(
as
you
know
)
to
the
education
of
the
reason
of
my
family
.
 
<EOS>
The
reason
is
(
as
you
know
)
<EOS>
the
only
faculty
to
which
education
should
be
addressed
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
,
Bounderby
,
it
would
appear
from
this
unexpected
circumstance
of
to
-
day
,
though
in
itself
a
trifling
one
,
as
if
something
had
crept
into
Thomas
's
and
Louisa
's
minds
which
is
---
or
rather
,
which
is
not
---
I
do
n't
know
that
I
can
express
myself
better
than
by
saying
---
which
has
never
been
intended
to
be
developed
,
and
in
which
their
reason
has
no
part
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
certainly
is
no
reason
in
looking
with
interest
at
a
parcel
of
vagabonds
,
"
returned
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
I
was
a
vagabond
myself
,
nobody
looked
with
any
interest
at
me
;
I
know
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
comes
the
question
,
"
said
the
eminently
practical
father
,
with
his
eyes
on
the
fire
,
"
in
what
has
this
vulgar
curiosity
its
rise
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
in
what
.
 
<EOS>
In
idle
imagination
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
"
said
the
eminently
practical
;
"
I
confess
,
however
,
that
the
misgiving
has
crossed
me
on
my
way
home
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
idle
imagination
,
Gradgrind
,
"
repeated
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
very
bad
thing
for
anybody
,
but
a
cursed
bad
thing
for
a
girl
like
Louisa
.
<EOS>
I
should
ask
Mrs
Gradgrind
's
pardon
for
strong
expressions
,
but
that
she
knows
very
well
I
am
not
a
refined
character
.
 
<EOS>
Whoever
expects
refinement
in
me
will
be
disappointed
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
n't
a
refined
bringing
up
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Whether
,
"
said
Gradgrind
,
pondering
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
his
cavernous
eyes
on
the
fire
,
"
whether
any
instructor
or
servant
can
have
suggested
anything
?
 
<EOS>
Whether
Louisa
or
Thomas
can
have
been
reading
anything
?
 
<EOS>
Whether
,
in
spite
of
all
precautions
,
any
idle
story
-
book
can
have
got
into
the
house
?
 
<EOS>
Because
,
in
minds
that
have
been
practically
formed
by
rule
and
line
,
from
the
cradle
upwards
,
this
is
so
curious
,
so
incomprehensible
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
a
bit
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bounderby
,
who
all
this
time
had
been
standing
,
as
before
,
on
the
hearth
,
bursting
at
the
very
furniture
of
the
room
with
explosive
humility
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
one
of
those
strollers
'
children
in
the
school
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cecilia
Jupe
,
by
name
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
with
something
of
a
stricken
look
at
his
friend
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
stop
a
bit
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bounderby
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
did
she
come
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
fact
is
,
I
saw
the
girl
myself
,
for
the
first
time
,
only
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
She
specially
applied
here
at
the
house
to
be
admitted
,
as
not
regularly
belonging
to
our
town
,
and
---
<EOS>
yes
,
you
are
right
,
Bounderby
,
you
are
right
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
stop
a
bit
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bounderby
,
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
"
Louisa
saw
her
when
she
came
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Louisa
certainly
did
see
her
,
for
she
mentioned
the
application
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
Louisa
saw
her
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
in
Mrs
Gradgrind
's
presence
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
Mrs
Gradgrind
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
"
what
passed
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
poor
health
!
"
returned
Mrs
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
girl
wanted
to
come
to
the
school
,
and
Mr
Gradgrind
wanted
girls
to
come
to
the
school
,
and
Louisa
and
Thomas
both
said
that
the
girl
wanted
to
come
,
and
that
Mr
Gradgrind
wanted
girls
to
come
,
and
how
was
it
possible
to
contradict
them
when
such
was
the
fact
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
I
tell
you
what
,
Gradgrind
!
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
Turn
this
girl
to
the
right
about
,
and
there
's
an
end
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
much
of
your
opinion
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
it
at
once
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
"
has
always
been
my
motto
from
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
thought
I
would
run
away
from
my
egg
-
box
and
my
grandmother
,
I
did
it
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Do
this
at
once
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
walking
?
"
asked
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
father
's
address
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
would
not
mind
walking
to
town
with
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
the
least
in
the
world
,
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
,
"
as
long
as
you
do
it
at
once
!
"
   
<EOS>
So
,
Mr
Bounderby
threw
on
his
hat
<EOS>
---
he
always
threw
it
on
,
as
expressing
a
man
who
had
been
far
too
busily
employed
in
making
himself
,
to
acquire
any
fashion
of
wearing
his
hat
---
and
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
sauntered
out
into
the
hall
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
wear
gloves
,
"
it
was
his
custom
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
climb
up
the
ladder
in
them
.
<EOS>
---
Should
n't
be
so
high
up
,
if
I
had
.
"
   
<EOS>
Being
left
to
saunter
in
the
hall
a
minute
or
two
while
Mr
Gradgrind
went
up
-
stairs
for
the
address
,
he
opened
the
door
of
the
children
's
study
and
looked
into
that
serene
floor
-
clothed
apartment
,
which
,
notwithstanding
its
book
-
cases
and
its
cabinets
and
its
variety
of
learned
and
philosophical
appliances
,
had
much
of
the
genial
aspect
of
a
room
devoted
to
hair
-
cutting
.
 
<EOS>
Louisa
languidly
leaned
upon
the
window
looking
out
,
without
looking
at
anything
,
while
young
Thomas
stood
sniffing
revengefully
at
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Adam
Smith
and
Malthus
,
two
younger
Gradgrinds
,
were
out
at
lecture
in
custody
;
and
little
Jane
,
after
manufacturing
a
good
deal
of
moist
pipe
-
clay
on
her
face
with
slate
-
pencil
and
tears
,
had
fallen
asleep
over
vulgar
fractions
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
right
now
,
Louisa
:
 
<EOS>
it
's
all
right
,
young
Thomas
,
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
;
"
you
wo
n't
do
so
any
more

<EOS>
I
'll
answer
for
<EOS>
it
's
being
all
over
with
father

<EOS>
Well
,
Louisa
,
that
's
worth
a
kiss
,
is
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
take
one
,
Mr
Bounderby
,
"
returned
Louisa
,
when
she
had
coldly
paused
,
and
slowly
walked
across
the
room
,
and
ungraciously
raised
her
cheek
towards
him
,
with
her
face
turned
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
Always
my
pet
;
ai
n't
you

Louisa
?
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
Louisa
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
went
his
way
,
but
she
stood
on
the
same
spot
,
rubbing
the
cheek
he
had
kissed
,
with
her
handkerchief
,
until
it
was
burning
red
.
<EOS>
She
was
still
doing
this
,
five
minutes
afterwards
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
about
,
Loo
?
"
<EOS>
her
brother
sulkily
remonstrated
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
rub
a
hole
in
your
face

"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
cut
the
piece
out

your
penknife

The
Keynote
 
Coketown
,
to
which
Messrs.
Bounderby
and
Gradgrind
now
walked
,
was
a
triumph
of
fact
;
it
had
no
greater
taint
of
fancy
in
it
than
Mrs
Gradgrind
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
strike
the
key
-
note
,
Coketown
,
before
pursuing
our
tune
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
town
of
red
brick
,
or
of
brick
that
would
have
been
red
if
the
smoke
and
ashes
had
allowed
it
;
but
as
matters
stood
,
it
was
a
town
of
unnatural
red
and
black
like
the
painted
face
of
a
savage
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
town
of
machinery
and
tall
chimneys
,
out
of
which
interminable
serpents
of
smoke
trailed
themselves
for
ever
and
ever
,
and
never
got
uncoiled
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
a
black
canal
in
it
,
and
a
river
that
ran
purple
with
ill
-
smelling
dye
,
and
vast
piles
of
building
full
of
windows
where
there
was
a
rattling
and
a
trembling
all
day
long
,
and
where
the
piston
of
the
steam
-
engine
worked
monotonously
up
and
down
,
like
the
head
of
an
elephant
in
a
state
of
melancholy
madness
.
 
<EOS>
It
contained
several
large
streets
all
very
like
one
another
,
and
many
small
streets
still
more
like
one
another
,
inhabited
by
people
equally
like
one
another
,
who
all
went
in
and
out
at
the
same
hours
,
with
the
same
sound
upon
the
same
pavements
,
to
do
the
same
work
,
and
to
whom
every
day
was
the
same
as
yesterday
and
to
-
morrow
,
and
every
year
the
counterpart
of
the
last
and
the
next
.
   
<EOS>
These
attributes
of
Coketown
were
in
the
main
inseparable
from
the
work
by
which
it
was
sustained
;
against
them
were
to
be
set
off
,
comforts
of
life
which
found
their
way
all
over
the
world
,
and
elegancies
of
life
which
made
,
we
will
not
ask
how
much
of
the
fine
lady
,
who
could
scarcely
bear
to
hear
the
place
mentioned
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
of
its
features
were
voluntary
,
and
they
were
these
.
   
<EOS>
You
saw
nothing
in
Coketown
but
what
was
severely
workful
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
members
of
a
religious
persuasion
built
a
chapel
there
---
as
the
members
of
eighteen
religious
persuasions
had
done
---
they
made
it
a
pious
warehouse
of
red
brick
,
with
sometimes
<EOS>
(
but
this
is
only
in
highly
ornamental
examples
)
<EOS>
a
bell
in
a
birdcage
on
the
top
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
solitary
exception
was
the
New
Church
;
a
stuccoed
edifice
with
a
square
steeple
over
the
door
,
terminating
in
four
short
pinnacles
like
florid
wooden
legs
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
public
inscriptions
in
the
town
were
painted
alike
,
in
severe
characters
of
black
and
white
.
 
<EOS>
The
jail
might
have
been
the
infirmary
,
the
infirmary
might
have
been
the
jail
,
the
town
-
hall
might
have
been
either
,
or
both
,
or
anything
else
,
for
anything
that
appeared
to
the
contrary
in
the
graces
of
their
construction
.
 
<EOS>
Fact
,
fact
,
fact
,
everywhere
in
the
material
aspect
of
the
town
;
fact
,
fact
,
fact
,
everywhere
in
the
immaterial
.
 
<EOS>
The
M'Choakumchild
school
was
all
fact
,
and
the
school
of
design
was
all
fact
,
and
the
relations
between
master
and
man
were
all
fact
,
and
everything
was
fact
between
the
lying
-
in
hospital
and
the
cemetery
,
and
what
you
could
n't
state
in
figures
,
or
show
to
be
purchaseable
in
the
cheapest
market
and
saleable
in
the
dearest
,
was
not
,
and
never
should
be
,
world
without
end
,
Amen
.
   
<EOS>
A
town
so
sacred
to
fact
,
and
so
triumphant
in
its
assertion
,
of
course
got
on
well
?
 
<EOS>
Why
no
,
not
quite
well
.
 
<EOS>
No
?
 
<EOS>
Dear
me
!
   
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
Coketown
did
not
come
out
of
its
own
furnaces
,
in
all
respects
like
gold
that
had
stood
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
the
perplexing
mystery
of
the
place
was
,
Who
belonged
to
the
eighteen
denominations
?
<EOS>
Because
,
whoever
did
,
the
labouring
people
did
not
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
strange
to
walk
through
the
streets
on
a
Sunday
morning
,
and
note
how
few
of
them
the
barbarous
jangling
of
bells
that
was
driving
the
sick
and
nervous
mad
,
called
away
from
their
own
quarter
,
from
their
own
close
rooms
,
from
the
corners
of
their
own
streets
,
where
they
lounged
listlessly
,
gazing
at
all
the
church
and
chapel
going
,
as
at
a
thing
with
which
they
had
no
manner
of
concern
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
it
merely
the
stranger
who
noticed
this
,
because
there
was
a
native
organization
in
Coketown
itself
,
whose
members
were
to
be
heard
of
in
the
House
of
Commons
every
session
,
indignantly
petitioning
for
acts
of
parliament
that
should
make
these
people
religious
by
main
force
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
the
Teetotal
Society
,
who
complained
that
these
same
people
would
get
drunk
,
and
showed
in
tabular
statements
that
they
did
get
drunk
,
and
proved
at
tea
parties
that
no
inducement
,
human
or
Divine
(
except
a
medal
)
,
would
induce
them
to
forego
their
custom
of
getting
drunk
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
the
chemist
and
druggist
,
with
other
tabular
statements
,
showing
that
when
they
did
n't
get
drunk
,
they
took
opium
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
the
experienced
chaplain
of
the
jail
,
with
more
tabular
statements
,
outdoing
all
the
previous
tabular
statements
,
and
showing
that
the
same
people
would
resort
to
low
haunts
,
hidden
from
the
public
eye
,
where
they
heard
low
singing
and
saw
low
dancing
,
and
mayhap
joined
in
it
;
and
where
A*B
,
aged
twenty
-
four
next
birthday
,
and
committed
for
eighteen
months
'
solitary
,
had
himself
said
(
not
that
he
had
ever
shown
himself
particularly
worthy
of
belief
)
<EOS>
his
ruin
began
,
as
he
was
perfectly
sure
and
confident
that
otherwise
he
would
have
been
a
tip
-
top
moral
specimen
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
Mr
Gradgrind
and
Mr
Bounderby
,
the
two
gentlemen
at
this
present
moment
walking
through
Coketown
,
and
both
eminently
practical
,
who
could
,
on
occasion
,
furnish
more
tabular
statements
derived
from
their
own
personal
experience
,
and
illustrated
by
cases
they
had
known
and
seen
,
from
which
it
clearly
appeared
---
in
short
,
it
was
the
only
clear
thing
in
the
case
---
that
these
same
people
were
a
bad
lot
altogether
,
gentlemen
;
that
do
what
you
would
for
them
<EOS>
they
were
never
thankful
for
it
,
gentlemen
;
that
they
were
restless
,
gentlemen
;
that
they
never
knew
what
they
wanted
;
that
they
lived
upon
the
best
,
and
bought
fresh
butter
;
and
insisted
on
Mocha
coffee
,
and
rejected
all
but
prime
parts
of
meat
,
and
yet
were
eternally
dissatisfied
and
unmanageable
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
it
was
the
moral
of
the
old
nursery
fable
:
   
<EOS>
There
was
an
old
woman
,
and
what
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
She
lived
upon
nothing
but
victuals
and
drink
;
Victuals
and
drink
were
the
whole
of
her
diet
,
And
yet
this
old
woman
would
NEVER
be
quiet
.
   
<EOS>
Is
it
possible
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
,
that
there
was
any
analogy
between
the
case
of
the
Coketown
population
and
the
case
of
the
little
Gradgrinds
?
 
<EOS>
Surely
,
none
of
us
in
our
sober
senses
and
acquainted
with
figures
,
are
to
be
told
at
this
time
of
day
,
that
one
of
the
foremost
elements
in
the
existence
of
the
Coketown
working
-
people
had
been
for
scores
of
years
,
deliberately
set
at
nought
?
 
<EOS>
That
there
was
any
Fancy
in
them
demanding
to
be
brought
into
healthy
existence
instead
of
struggling
on
in
convulsions
?
 
<EOS>
That
exactly
in
the
ratio
as
they
worked
long
and
monotonously
,
the
craving
grew
within
them
for
some
physical
relief
---
some
relaxation
,
encouraging
good
humour
and
good
spirits
,
and
giving
them
a
vent
---
some
recognized
holiday
,
though
it
were
but
for
an
honest
dance
to
a
stirring
band
of
music
---
some
occasional
light
pie
in
which
even
M'Choakumchild
had
no
finger
---
which
craving
must
and
would
be
satisfied
aright
,
or
must
and
would
inevitably
go
wrong
,
until
the
laws
of
the
Creation
were
repealed
?
   
<EOS>
"
This

lives
at
Pod

End

and
I
do
n't
quite

End

"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
"
Which
is
it
,
Bounderby
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
knew
it
was
somewhere
down
town
,
but
knew
no
more
respecting
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
stopped
for
a
moment
,
looking
about
.
   
<EOS>
Almost
as
they
did
so
,
there
came
running
round
the
corner
of
the
street
at
a
quick
pace
and
with
a
frightened
look
,
a
girl
whom
Mr
Gradgrind
recognized
.
 
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
 
<EOS>
Where
are
you
going
!
<EOS>
Stop
!
"
 
<EOS>
Girl
number
twenty
stopped
then
,
palpitating
,
and
made
him
a
curtsey
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
are
you
tearing
about
the
streets
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
"
in
this
improper
manner
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
---
<EOS>
I
was
run
after
,
sir
,
"
the
girl
panted
,
"
and
I
wanted
to
get
away
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Run
after
?
"
repeated
Mr
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
would
run
after
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
question
was
unexpectedly
and
suddenly
answered
for
her
,
by
the
colourless
boy
,
Bitzer
,
who
came
round
the
corner
with
such
blind
speed
and
so
little
anticipating
a
stoppage
on
the
pavement
,
that
he
brought
himself
up
against
Mr
Gradgrind
's
waistcoat
and
rebounded
into
the
road
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
boy
?
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
doing
?
<EOS>
How
dare
you
dash
against
---
everybody
---
in
this
manner
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Bitzer
picked
up
his
cap
,
which
the
concussion
had
knocked
off
;
and
backing
,
and
knuckling
his
forehead
,
pleaded
that
it
was
an
accident
.
   
<EOS>
"
Was
this
boy
running
after
you
,
Jupe
?
"
asked
Mr
Gradgrind
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
said
the
girl
reluctantly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
was
n't

sir

"
<EOS>
cried
Bitzer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not

she
run
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
But
the
horse

riders

mind

<EOS>
You

famous
for

addressing
Sissy
.
 
<EOS>
"
It

as
well

<EOS>
Bitzer
tried
Mr
Bounderby
with
this
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
frightened
me
so
,
"
said
the
girl
,
"
with
his
cruel
faces
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh

cried
Bitzer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh

An't

<EOS>
I
never
looked
at

<EOS>
I
asked
her
if
she
would
know
how
to
define
a
horse
to

morrow

and
offered
to
tell
her
again
,
and
she
ran
away
,
and
I
ran
after
her
,
sir
,
that
she
might
know
how
to
answer
when
she
was
asked
.
 
<EOS>
You
would

of
saying
such
mischief

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Her

pretty
well

observed
Mr

.
 
<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
"
Truly

returned
his

<EOS>
"
Bitzer
,
turn
you
about

take

Go

<EOS>
The
boy
stopped
in
his
rapid
blinking
,
knuckled
his
forehead
again
,
glanced
at
Sissy
,
turned
about
,
and
retreated
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now

said
Mr

with
a
loud
short

"

replied
the
girl
,
looking
over
her
shoulder
,
to
assure
herself
that
her
pursuer
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
"
They

Serve

said
Mr

for

She
glanced
up
at
his
face
,
with
mingled
astonishment
and
dread
.
   
<EOS>
"

"
said
Mr
Bounderby
,
"
when
I
was
four

five

I
had
worse
bruises
upon

ten

twenty

forty

would
have
rubbed
off

<EOS>
I
did
n't
get
'em
by
posture

making

but
by
being
banged
about

<EOS>
There
was
no
rope

dancing
for
me

I
danced
on
the
bare

was
larruped

rope

<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
,
though
hard
enough
,
was
by
no
means
so
rough
a
man
as
Mr
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
His
character
was
not
unkind
,
all
things
considered
;
it
might
have
been
a
very
kind
one
indeed
,
if
he
had
only
made
some
round
mistake
in
the
arithmetic
that
balanced
it
,
years
ago
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
in
what
he
meant
for
a
reassuring
tone
,
as
they
turned
down
a
narrow
road
,
"
<EOS>
And
this
is
Pod

End

This

"
   
<EOS>
She
stopped
,
at
twilight
,
at
the
door
of
a
mean
little
public
-
house
,
with
dim
red
lights
in
it

<EOS>
As
haggard
and
as
shabby
,
as
if
,
for
want
of
custom
,
it
had
itself
taken
to
drinking
,
and
had
gone
the
way
all
drunkards
go
,
and
was
very
near
the
end
of
it

<EOS>
"
It
's
only
crossing
the

and
waiting
there

with

laugh

Horsemanship
 
<EOS>
The
name
of
the
public
-
house
was
the
Pegasus
's
Arms
.
 
<EOS>
The
Pegasus
's
legs
might
have
been
more
to
the
purpose
;
but
,
underneath
the
winged
horse
upon
the
sign
-
board
,
the
Pegasus
's
Arms
was
inscribed
in
Roman
letters
.
 
<EOS>
Beneath
that
inscription
again
,
in
a
flowing
scroll
,
the
painter
had
touched
off
the
lines
:
   
<EOS>
Good
malt
makes
good
beer
,
Walk
in
,
and
they
'll
draw
it
here
;
Good
wine
makes
good
brandy
,
Give
us
a
call
,
and
you
'll
find
it
handy
.
   
<EOS>
Framed
and
glazed
upon
the
wall
behind
the
dingy
little
bar
,
was
another
Pegasus
---
a
theatrical
one
---
with
real
gauze
let
in
for
his
wings
,
golden
stars
stuck
on
all
over
him
,
and
his
ethereal
harness
made
of
red
silk
.
   
<EOS>
As
it
had
grown
too
dusky
without
,
to
see
the
sign
,
and
as
it
had
not
grown
light
enough
within
to
see
the
picture
,
Mr
Gradgrind
and
Mr
Bounderby
received
no
offence
from
these
idealities
.
 
<EOS>
They
followed
the
girl
up
some
steep
corner
-
stairs
without
meeting
any
one
,
and
stopped
in
the
dark
while
she
went
on
for
a
candle
.
 
<EOS>
They
expected
every
moment
to
hear
Merrylegs
give
tongue
,
but
the
highly
trained
performing
dog
had
not
barked
when
the
girl
and
the
candle
appeared
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
Father
is
not
in
our
room
,
sir
,
"
she
said
,
with
a
face
of
great
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
would
n't
mind
walking
in
,
I
'll
find
him
directly
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
walked
in
;
and
Sissy
,
having
set
two
chairs
for
them
,
sped
away
with
a
quick
light
step
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
mean
,
shabbily
furnished
room
,
with
a
bed
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
white
night
-
cap
,
embellished
with
two
peacock
's
feathers
and
a
pigtail
bolt
upright
,
in
which
Signor
Jupe
had
that
very
afternoon
enlivened
the
varied
performances
with
his
chaste
Shaksperean
quips
and
retorts
,
hung
upon
a
nail
;
but
no
other
portion
of
his
wardrobe
,
or
other
token
of
himself
or
his
pursuits
,
was
to
be
seen
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
Merrylegs
,
that
respectable
ancestor
of
the
highly
trained
animal
who
went
aboard
the
ark
,
might
have
been
accidentally
shut
out
of
it
,
for
any
sign
of
a
dog
that
was
manifest
to
eye
or
ear
in
the
Pegasus
's
Arms
.
   
<EOS>
They
heard
the
doors
of
rooms
above
,
opening
and
shutting
as
Sissy
went
from
one
to
another
in
quest
of
her
father
;
and
presently
they
heard
voices
expressing
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
She
came
bounding
down
again
in
a
great
hurry
,
opened
a
battered
and
mangy
old
hair
trunk
,
found
it
empty
,
and
looked
round
with
her
hands
clasped
and
her
face
full
of
terror
.
   
<EOS>
"
Father
must
have
gone
down
to
the
Booth
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
he
should
go
there
,
but
he
must
be
there
;
I
'll
bring
him
in
a
minute
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
was
gone
directly
,
without
her
bonnet
;
with
her
long
,
dark
,
childish
hair
streaming
behind
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
does
she
mean
!
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
"
Back
in
a
minute
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
more
than
a
mile
off
.
"
   
<EOS>
Before
Mr
Bounderby
could
reply
,
a
young
man
appeared
at
the
door
,
and
introducing
himself
with
the
words
,
"
By
your
leaves
,
gentlemen
!
<EOS>
"
walked
in
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
,
close
-
shaven
,
thin
,
and
sallow
,
was
shaded
by
a
great
quantity
of
dark
hair
,
brushed
into
a
roll
all
round
his
head
,
and
parted
up
the
centre
.
 
<EOS>
His
legs
were
very
robust
,
but
shorter
than
legs
of
good
proportions
should
have
been
.
 
<EOS>
His
chest
and
back
were
as
much
too
broad
,
as
his
legs
were
too
short
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
in
a
Newmarket
coat
and
tight
-
fitting
trousers
;
wore
a
shawl
round
his
neck
;
smelt
of
lamp
-
oil
,
straw
,
orange
-
peel
,
horses
'
provender
,
and
sawdust
;
and
looked
a
most
remarkable
sort
of
Centaur
,
compounded
of
the
stable
and
the
play
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
Where
the
one
began
,
and
the
other
ended
,
nobody
could
have
told
with
any
precision
.
 
<EOS>
This
gentleman
was
mentioned
in
the
bills
of
the
day
as
Mr
E*W*B
Childers
,
so
justly
celebrated
for
his
daring
vaulting
act
as
the
Wild
Huntsman
of
the
North
American
Prairies
;
in
which
popular
performance
,
a
diminutive
boy
with
an
old
face
,
who
now
accompanied
him
,
assisted
as
his
infant
son
:
 
being
carried
upside
down
over
his
father
's
shoulder
,
by
one

by
the
crown

heels
upwards

the
violent
paternal
manner

observed
to
fondle
their
offspring

<EOS>
Made
up
with
curls
,
wreaths
,
wings
,
white
bismuth
,
and
carmine
,
this
hopeful
young
person
soared
into
so
pleasing
a
Cupid
as
to
constitute
the
chief
delight
of
the
maternal
part
of
the
spectators
;
but
in
private
,
where
his
characteristics
were
a
precocious
cutaway
coat
and
an
extremely
gruff
voice
<EOS>
,
he
became
of
the
Turf
,
turfy
.
   
<EOS>
"
By

said
Mr
E*W*B
Childers

glancing
round
the

"
It

It
was

said
Mr

His

<EOS>

Mr

after
surveying
him
from

the

asked
Mr

Mr

interpreted
.

"
Oh

said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
"
that

is
it

"
   
<EOS>
"
In
a
general
way

missing

Mr

answered

"
Nine

ejaculated
Bounderby

Cupid

Oh

Mr

Master

nothing

<EOS>
"
There

<EOS>
Get

said
Mr

thrusting
his
young

from

rather
in
the
prairie
manner

<EOS>
"
Tight

<EOS>
"
Yes

I
was

"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
continued
Mr
Childers
,
quickly
,
"
<EOS>
my
opinion
is
,
he
will
never
receive
it

<EOS>
Do
you
know
much

<EOS>
"
I
never

<EOS>
"
I
doubt

you
ever
will
see
him
now

<EOS>
It
's
pretty
plain
to
me
,
he
's
off

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
that
he
has
deserted
his
daughter

"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
"
said
Mr
Childers
,
with
a
nod
,
"
that
he
has
cut
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
goosed
last
night

he
was
goosed
the
night
before
last

he
was
goosed
to

day

<EOS>
He
has
lately
got
in
the
way

being
always
goosed
,
and
he
ca
n't
stand
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
has
he
been
---
so
very
much
---
Goosed
?
"
asked
Mr
Gradgrind
,
forcing
the
word
out
of
himself
,
with
great
solemnity
and
reluctance
.
   
<EOS>
"
His
joints
are
turning
stiff
,
and
he
is
getting
used
up
,
"
said
Childers
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
has
his
points
as
a
Cackler
still
,

he
ca
n't
get
a
living
out
of
them

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
Cackler

<EOS>
Bounderby
repeated
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
we
go
again

"
   
<EOS>
"
A
speaker
,
if
the
gentleman
likes
it
better
,
"
said
Mr
E*W*B
Childers
,
superciliously
throwing
the
interpretation
over
his
shoulder
,
and
accompanying
it
with
a
shake
of
his
long
hair
---
which
all
shook
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
it
's
a
remarkable
fact
,
sir
,
that
it
cut
that
man
deeper
,
to
know
that
his
daughter
knew
of
his
being
goosed
,
than
to
go
through
with
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Mr
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
good
,
Gradgrind
!
 
<EOS>
A
man
so
fond
of
his
daughter

that
he
runs
away

her

<EOS>
This
is
devilish
good
!
 
<EOS>
Ha

<EOS>
Now

I
'll
tell
you
what

young

<EOS>
I
have
n't
always
occupied
my
present
station
of

<EOS>
I
know
what
these
things
are

<EOS>
You
may
be
astonished
to
hear
it
,
but
<EOS>
my
mother
---
ran
away
from
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
E*W*B
Childers
replied
pointedly
,
that
he
was
not
at
all
astonished
to
hear
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well
,
"
said
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
born
in
a
ditch
,
and
my
mother
ran
away
from
me
.
 
<EOS>
Do
I
excuse
her
for
it
?
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
Have
I
ever
excused
her
for
it
?
 
<EOS>
Not
I.
 
<EOS>
What
do
I
call
her
for
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
call
her
probably
the
very
worst
woman
that
ever
lived
in
the
world
,
except
my
drunken
grandmother
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
no
family
pride
about
me
,
there
's
no
imaginative
sentimental
humbug
about
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
a
spade
a
spade
;
and
I
call
the
mother
of
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
,
without
any
fear
or
any
favour
,
what
I
should
call
her
if
she
had
been
the
mother
of
Dick
Jones
of
Wapping
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
with
this
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
runaway
rogue
and
a
vagabond
,
that
's
what
he
is
,
in
English
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
the
same
to
me
what
he
is
or
what
he
is
not
,
whether
in
English
or
whether
in
French
,
"
retorted
Mr
E*W*B
Childers
,
facing
about
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
telling
your
friend
<EOS>
what
's
the
fact
;
if
you
do
n't
like
to
hear
it
,
you
can
avail
yourself
of
the
open
air
.
 
<EOS>
You
give
it
mouth
enough
,
you
do
;
but
give
it
mouth
in
your
own
building
at
least
,
"
remonstrated
E*W*B
with
stern
irony
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
give
it
mouth
in
this
building
,
till
you
're
called
upon
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
got
some
building
of
your
own
<EOS>
I
dare
say
,
now
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
so
,
"
replied
Mr
Bounderby
,
rattling
his
money
and
laughing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
give
it
mouth
in
your
own
building
,
will
you
,
if
you
please
?
"
said
Childers
.
 
<EOS>
"
Because
this
is
n't
a
strong
building
,
and
too
much
of
you
might
bring
it
down
!
"
   
<EOS>
Eyeing
Mr
Bounderby
from
head
to
foot
again
<EOS>
,
he
turned
from
him
,
as
from
a
man
finally
disposed
of
,
to
Mr
Gradgrind
.
   
<EOS>
"
Jupe
sent
his
daughter
out
on
an
errand
not
an
hour
ago
,
and
then
was
seen
to
slip
out
himself
,
with
his
hat
over
his
eyes
,
and
a
bundle
tied
up
in
a
handkerchief
under
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
She
will
never
believe
it
of
him
,
but
he
has
cut
away
and
left
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
"
why
will
she
never
believe
it
of
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
those
two
were
one
.
 
<EOS>
Because
they
were
never
asunder
.
<EOS>
Because
,
up
to
this
time
,
he
seemed
to
dote
upon
her
,
"
said
Childers
,
taking
a
step
or
two
to
look
into
the
empty
trunk
.
 
<EOS>
Both
Mr
Childers
and
Master
Kidderminster
walked
in
a
curious
manner
;
with
their
legs
wider
apart
than
the
general
run
of
men
,
and
with
a
very
knowing
assumption
of
being
stiff
in
the
knees
.
 
<EOS>
This
walk
was
common
to
all
the
male
members
of
Sleary
's
company
,
and
was
understood
to
express
,
that
they
were
always
on
horseback
.
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
Sissy
!
 
<EOS>
He
had
better
have
apprenticed
her
,
"
said
Childers
,
giving
his
hair
another
shake
,
as
he
looked
up
from
the
empty
box
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
he
leaves
her
without
anything
to
take
to
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
creditable
to
you
,
who
have
never
been
apprenticed
,
to
express
that
opinion
,
"
returned
Mr
Gradgrind
,
approvingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
apprenticed
?
 
<EOS>
I
was
apprenticed
when
I
was
seven
year
old
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
Indeed
?
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
rather
resentfully
,
as
having
been
defrauded
of
his
good
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
aware
of
its
being
the
custom
to
apprentice
young
persons
to
---
"
   
"
Idleness
,
"
Mr
Bounderby
put
in
with
a
loud
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
by
the
Lord
Harry
!
 
<EOS>
Nor
I
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Her
father
always
had
it
in
his
head
,
"
resumed
Childers
,
feigning
unconsciousness
of
Mr
Bounderby
's
existence
,
"
that
she
was
to
be
taught
the
deuce
-
and
-
all
of
education
.
 
<EOS>
How
it
got
into
his
head
,
I
ca
n't
say
;
I
can
only
say
that
it
never
got
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
been
picking
up
a
bit
of
reading
for
her
,
here
---
and
a
bit
of
writing
for
her
,
there
---
and
a
bit
of
ciphering
for
her
,
somewhere
else
---
these
seven
years
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
E*W*B
Childers
took
one
of
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
,
stroked
his
face
and
chin
,
and
looked
,
with
a
good
deal
of
doubt
and
a
little
hope
,
at
Mr
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
first
he
had
sought
to
conciliate
that
gentleman
,
for
the
sake
of
the
deserted
girl
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
Sissy
got
into
the
school
here
,
"
he
pursued
,
"
her
father
was
as
pleased
as
Punch
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
altogether
make
out
<EOS>
why
,
myself
,
as
we
were
not
stationary
here
,
being
but
comers
and
goers
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
however
,
he
had
this
move
in
his
mind
---
he
was
always
half
-
cracked
---
and
then
considered
her
provided
for
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
should
happen
to
have
looked
in
to
-
night
,
for
the
purpose
of
telling
him
that
you
were
going
to
do
her
any
little
service
,
"
said
Mr
Childers
,
stroking
his
face
again
,
and
repeating
his
look
,
"
it
would
be
very
fortunate
and
well
-
timed
;
very
fortunate
and
well
-
timed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
"
returned
Mr
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
came
to
tell
him
that
her
connections
made
her
not
an
object
for
the
school
,
and
that
she
must
not
attend
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
if
her
father
really
has
left
her
,
without
any
connivance
on
her
part
---
Bounderby
,
let
me
have
a
word
with
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
Mr
Childers
politely
betook
himself
,
with
his
equestrian
walk
,
to
the
landing
outside
the
door
,
and
there
stood
stroking
his
face
,
and
softly
whistling
.
 
<EOS>
While
thus
engaged
,
he
overheard
such
phrases
in
Mr
Bounderby
's
voice
as
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
no
.
<EOS>
I
advise
you
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
by
no
means
.
<EOS>
"
 
While
,
from
Mr
Gradgrind
,
he
heard
in
his
much
lower
tone
the
words
,
"
But
even
as
an
example
to
Louisa
,
of
what
this
pursuit
which
has
been
the
subject
of
a
vulgar
curiosity
,
leads
to
and
ends
in
.
 
<EOS>
Think
of
it
,
<EOS>
Bounderby
,
in
that
point
of
view
.
"
   
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
various
members
of
Sleary
's
company
gradually
gathered
together
from
the
upper
regions
,
where
they
were
quartered
,
and
,
from
standing
about
,
talking
in
low
voices
to
one
another
and
to
Mr
Childers
,
gradually
insinuated
themselves
and
him
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
two
or
three
handsome
young
women
among
them
,
with
their
two
or
three
husbands
,
and
their
two
or
three
mothers
,
and
their
eight
or
nine
little
children
,
who
did
the
fairy
business
when
required
.
 
<EOS>
The
father
of
one
of
the
families
was
in
the
habit
of
balancing
the
father
of
another
of
the
families
on
the
top
of
a
great
pole
;
the
father
of
a
third
family
often
made
a
pyramid
of
both
those
fathers
,
with
Master
Kidderminster
for
the
apex
,
and
himself
for
the
base
;
all
the
fathers
could
dance
upon
rolling
casks
,
stand
upon
bottles
,
catch
knives
and
balls
,
twirl
hand
-
basins
,
ride
upon
anything
,
jump
over
everything
,
and
stick
at
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
mothers
could
(
and
did
)
dance
,
upon
the
slack
wire
and
the
tight
-
rope
,
and
perform
rapid
acts
on
bare
-
backed
steeds
;
none
of
them
were
at
all
particular
in
respect
of
showing
their
legs
;
and
one
of
them
,
alone
in
a
Greek
chariot
,
drove
six
in
hand
into
every
town
they
came
to
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
assumed
to
be
mighty
rakish
and
knowing
,
they
were
not
very
tidy
in
their
private
dresses
,
they
were
not
at
all
orderly
in
their
domestic
arrangements
,
and
the
combined
literature
of
the
whole
company
would
have
produced
but
a
poor
letter
on
any
subject
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
there
was
a
remarkable
gentleness
and
childishness
about
these
people
,
a
special
inaptitude
for
any
kind
of
sharp
practice
,
and
an
untiring
readiness
to
help
and
pity
one
another
,
deserving
often
of
as
much
respect
,
and
always
of
as
much
generous
construction
,
as
the
every
-
day
virtues
of
any
class
of
people
in
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
Last
of
all
appeared
Mr
Sleary
:
 
<EOS>
a
stout
man
as
already
mentioned
,
with
one
fixed
eye
,
and
one
loose
eye
,
a
voice
(
if
it
can
be
called
so
)
like
the
efforts
of
a
broken
old
pair
of
bellows
,
a
flabby
surface
,
and
a
muddled
head
which
was
never
sober
and
never
drunk
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thquire
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Sleary
,
who
was
troubled
with
asthma
,
and
whose
breath
came
far
too
thick
and
heavy
for
the
letter
s^
,
"

answered
"

"
   
<EOS>
"
Well

he
returned
,
taking
off
his

,
and
rubbing
the
lining
with
his

,
which
he
kept
inside
for
the

<EOS>
Here
his
daughter
Josephine
---
a
pretty
fair
-
haired
girl
of
eighteen
,
who
had
been
tied
on
a
horse
at
two
years
old
,
and
had
made
a
will
at
twelve
,
which
she
always
carried
about
with
her
,
expressive
of
her
dying
desire
to
be
drawn
to
the
grave
by
the
two
piebald
ponies
---
cried
,
"
Father
,
hush
!
<EOS>
she
has
come
back
!
"
 
<EOS>
Then
came
Sissy
Jupe
,
running
into
the
room
as
she
had
run
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
And
when
she
saw
them
all
assembled
,
and
saw
their
looks
,
and
saw
no
father
there
,
she
broke
into
a
most
deplorable
cry
,
and
took
refuge
on
the
bosom
of
the
most
accomplished
tight
-
rope
lady
(
herself
in
the
family
-
way
)
,
who
knelt
down
on
the
floor
to
nurse
her
,
and
to
weep
over
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ith

said
Sleary
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
O

<EOS>
You

And

poor

"
 
<EOS>
It
was
so
pathetic
to
hear
her
saying
many
things
of
this
kind
,
with
her
face
turned
upward
,
and
her
arms
stretched
out
as
if
she
were
trying
to
stop
his
departing
shadow
and
embrace
it
,
that
no
one
spoke
a
word
until
Mr
Bounderby
(
growing
impatient
)
took
the
case
in
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
good
people
all
,
"
said
he
,
"
this
is
wanton
waste
of
time
.
<EOS>
Let
the
girl
understand
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
Let
her
take
it
from
me
,

you

myself

<EOS>
Here
,
what
's
your
name
!
<EOS>
Your
father
has
absconded
---
deserted
you
---
and
you
must
n't
expect
to
see
him
again
as
long
as
you
live
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
cared
so
little
for
plain
Fact
,
these
people
,
and
were
in
that
advanced
state
of
degeneracy
on
the
subject
,
that
instead
of
being
impressed
by
the
speaker
's
strong
common
sense
,
they
took
it
in
extraordinary
dudgeon
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
muttered
"
Shame
!
"
and
the
women
"
Brute
!
"
and
Sleary
,
in
some
haste
,
communicated
the
following
hint
,
apart
to
Mr
Bounderby
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
,
Thquire
.
 
<EOS>
To
thpeak
plain
to
you
,
my
opinion
ith
that
you
had
better
cut
it
thort
,
and
drop
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
're
<EOS>
a
very
good
natur'd
people
,
my
people
,
but
they
're
accuthtomed
to
be
quick
in
their
movementh
;
and
if
you
do
n't
act
upon
my
advithe
,
I
'm
damned
if
I
do
n't
believe
they
'll
pith
you
out
o
'
winder
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
being
restrained
by
this
mild
suggestion
,
Mr
Gradgrind
found
an
opening
for
his
eminently
practical
exposition
of
the
subject
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
of
no
moment
,
"
said
he
,
"
whether
this
person
is
to
be
expected
back
at
any
time
,
or
the
contrary
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
gone
away
,
and
there
is
no
present
expectation
of
his
return
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
I
believe
,
is
agreed
on
all
hands
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thath
agreed
,
Thquire
.
 
<EOS>
Thick
to
that
!
"
 
<EOS>
From
Sleary
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
,
who
came
here
to
inform
the
father
of
the
poor
girl
,
Jupe
,
that
she
could
not
be
received
at
the
school
any
more
,
in
consequence
of
there
being
practical
objections
,
into
which
I
need
not
enter
,
to
the
reception
there
of
the
children
of
persons
so
employed
,
am
prepared
in
these
altered
circumstances
to
make
a
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
willing
to
take
charge
of
you
,
Jupe
,
and
to
educate
you
,
and
provide
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
condition
(
over
and
above
your
good
behaviour
)
<EOS>
I
make
is
,
that
you
decide
now
,
at
once
,
whether
to
accompany
me
or
remain
here
.
 
<EOS>
Also
,
that
if
you
accompany
me
now
,
it
is
understood
that
you
communicate
no
more
with
any
of
your
friends
who
are
here
present
.
 
<EOS>
These
observations
comprise
the
whole
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
the
thame
time
,
"
said
Sleary
,
"
I
mutht
put
in
my
word

Thquire

tho
that
both
thides
of

banner
may

If

"
   
<EOS>
The
latter
part
of
this
speech
was
addressed
to
Mr
Gradgrind
,
who
received
it
with
a
grave
inclination
of
his
head
,
and
then
remarked
:
   
"
<EOS>
The
only
observation
I
will
make
to
you
,
Jupe
,
in
the
way
of
influencing
your
decision
,
is
,
that
it
is
highly
desirable
to
have
a
sound
practical
education
,
and
that
even
your
father
himself
(
from
what
I
understand
)
appears
,
on
your
behalf
,
to
have
known
and
felt
that
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
last
words
had
a
visible
effect
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
stopped
in
her
wild
crying
,
a
little
detached
herself
from
Emma
Gordon
,
and
turned
her
face
full
upon
her
patron
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
company
perceived
the
force
of
the
change
,
and
drew
a
long
breath
together
,
that
plainly
said
,
"
she
will
go
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Be
sure
you
know
your
own
mind
,
Jupe
,
"
Mr
Gradgrind
cautioned
her
;
"
I
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Be
sure
you
know
your
own
mind
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
father
comes
back
,
"
cried
the
girl
,
bursting
into
tears
again
after
a
minute
's
silence
,
"
how
will
he
ever
find
me
if
I
go
away
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
quite
at
ease

"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
calmly
;
he
worked
out
the
whole
matter
like
a
sum
:
 
<EOS>
"
you
may
be
quite
at

Jupe

on

<EOS>
In

I
should
have
no
power

keeping

have
no

at

time

"
   
<EOS>
"

assented
Mr

,
rolling
his
loose
eye
.
 
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
There
was
another
silence
;
and
then
she
exclaimed
,
sobbing
with
her
hands
before
her
face
,
"
Oh

give

my

give

and

go

"
   
<EOS>
The
women
sadly
bestirred
themselves
to
get
the
clothes
together
---
it
was
soon
done
,
for
they
were
not
many
---
and
to
pack
them
in
a
basket
which
had
often
travelled
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
Sissy
sat
all
the
time
upon
the
ground
,
still
sobbing
,
and
covering
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
and
his
friend
Bounderby
stood
near
the
door
,
ready
to
take
her
away
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sleary
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
with
the
male
members
of
the
company
about
him
,
exactly
as
he
would
have
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
ring
during
his
daughter
Josephine

performance

He
wanted
nothing
but
his
whip
.
   
<EOS>
The
basket
packed
in
silence
,
they
brought
her
bonnet
to
her
,
and
smoothed
her
disordered
hair
,
and
put
it
on
.
 
<EOS>
Then
they
pressed
about
her
,
and
bent
over
her
in
very
natural
attitudes
,
kissing
and
embracing
her
:
 
and
brought
the
children
to
take
leave
of
her
;
and
were
a
tender
-
hearted
,
simple
,
foolish
set
of
women
altogether
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now

Jupe

"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
quite
determined
,
come
!
"
   
<EOS>
But
she
had
to
take
her
farewell
of
the
male
part
of
the
company
yet
,
and
every
one
of
them
had
to
unfold
his
arms
(
for
they
all
assumed
the
professional
attitude
when
they
found
themselves
near
Sleary
)
,
and
give
her
a
parting
kiss
---
<EOS>
Master
Kidderminster
excepted
,
in
whose
young
nature
there
was
an
original
flavour
of
the
misanthrope
,
who
was
also
known
to
have
harboured
matrimonial
views
,
and
who
moodily
withdrew
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sleary
was
reserved
until
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
Opening
his
arms
wide
<EOS>
he
took
her
by
both
her
hands
,
and
would
have
sprung
her
up
and
down
,
after
the
riding
-
master
manner
of
congratulating
young
ladies
on
their
dismounting
from
a
rapid
act
;
but
there
was
no
rebound
in
Sissy
,
and
she
only
stood
before
him
crying
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-

"
said
Sleary
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
'll

<EOS>
With
that
he
regarded
her
attentively
with
his
fixed
eye
,
surveyed
his
company
with
his
loose
one
,
kissed
her
,
shook
his
head
,
and
handed
her
to
Mr
Gradgrind
as
to
a
horse
.
   
<EOS>
"
There

he
said
,
sweeping
her
with
a
professional

adjusted

<EOS>
In
a
variety
of
voices
from
all
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
But
the
riding
-
master
eye
had
observed
the
bottle
of
the
nine
oils
in
her
bosom
,
and
he
now
interposed
with
"
Leave

No

in

"
Oh

He

He
had
never

going

by

much

<EOS>
The
Sleary

was
propounded
as
they
went
downstairs
and
the
fixed
eye
of
Philosophy
---
and
its
rolling

soon
lost

Chapter
07
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
being
a
bachelor
,
an
elderly
lady
presided
over
his
establishment
,
in
consideration
of
a
certain
annual
stipend
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
was
this
lady
's
name
;
and
she
was
a
prominent
figure
in
attendance
on
Mr
Bounderby
's
car
,
as
it
rolled
along
in
triumph
with
the
Bully
of
humility
inside
.
   
<EOS>
For
,
Mrs
Sparsit
had
not
only
seen
different
days
,
but
was
highly
connected
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
a
great
aunt
living
in
these
very
times
called
Lady
Scadgers
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sparsit
,
deceased
,
of
whom
she
was
the
relict
,
had
been
by
the
mother
's
side
what
Mrs
Sparsit
still
called
"
a
Powler
.
"
 
<EOS>
Strangers
of
limited
information
and
dull
apprehension
were
sometimes
observed
not
to
know
what
a
Powler
was
,
and
even
to
appear
uncertain
whether
it
might
be
a
business
,
or
a
political
party
,
or
a
profession
of
faith
.
 
<EOS>
The
better
class
of
minds
,
however
,
did
not
need
to
be
informed
that
the
Powlers
were
an
ancient
stock
,
who
could
trace
themselves
so
exceedingly
far
back
that
it
was
not
surprising
if
they
sometimes
lost
themselves
---
which
they
had
rather
frequently
done
,
as
respected
horse
-
flesh
,
blind
-
hookey
,
Hebrew
monetary
transactions
,
and
the
Insolvent
Debtors
'
Court
.
   
<EOS>
The
late
Mr
Sparsit
,
being
by
the
mother
's
side
a
Powler
,
married
this
lady
,
being
by
the
father
's
side
a
Scadgers
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Scadgers
(
an
immensely
fat
old
woman
,
with
an
inordinate
appetite
for
butcher
's
meat
,
and
a
mysterious
leg
which
had
now
refused
to
get
out
of
bed
for
fourteen
years
)
contrived
the
marriage
,
at
a
period
when
Sparsit
was
just
of
age
,
and
chiefly
noticeable
for
a
slender
body
,
weakly
supported
on
two
long
slim
props
,
and
surmounted
by
no
head
worth
mentioning
.
 
<EOS>
He
inherited
a
fair
fortune
from
his
uncle
,
but
owed
it
all
before
he
came
into
it
,
and
spent
it
twice
over
immediately
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
when
he
died
,
at
twenty
-
four
(
the
scene
of
his
decease
,
Calais
,
and
the
cause
,
brandy
)
,
he
did
not
leave
his
widow
,
from
whom
he
had
been
separated
soon
after
the
honeymoon
,
in
affluent
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
That
bereaved
lady
,
fifteen
years
older
than
he
,
fell
presently
at
deadly
feud
with
her
only
relative
,
Lady
Scadgers
;
and
,
partly
to
spite
her
ladyship
,
and
partly
to
maintain
herself
,
went
out
at
a
salary
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
she
was
now
,
in
her
elderly
days
,
with
the
Coriolanian
style
of
nose
and
the
dense
black
eyebrows
which
had
captivated
Sparsit
,
making
Mr
Bounderby
's
tea
as
he
took
his
breakfast
.
   
<EOS>
If
Bounderby
had
been
a
Conqueror
,
and
Mrs
Sparsit
a
captive
Princess
whom
he
took
about
as
a
feature
in
his
state
-
processions
,
he
could
not
have
made
a
greater
flourish
with
her
than
he
habitually
did
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
it
belonged
to
his
boastfulness
to
depreciate
his
own
extraction
,
so
it
belonged
to
it
to
exalt
Mrs
Sparsit
's
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
measure
that
he
would
not
allow
his
own
youth
to
have
been
attended
by
a
single
favourable
circumstance
,
he
brightened
Mrs
Sparsit
's
juvenile
career
with
every
possible
advantage
,
and
showered
waggon
-
loads
of
early
roses
all
over
that
lady
's
path
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
yet
,
sir
,
"
he
would
say
,
"
how
does
it
turn
out
after
all
?
 
<EOS>
Why
here
she
is
at
a
hundred
a
year
<EOS>
(
I
give
her
a
hundred
,
which
she
is
pleased
to
term
handsome
)
,
keeping
the
house
of
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
!
"
   
<EOS>
Nay
,
he
made
this
foil
of
his
so
very
widely
known
,
that
third
parties
took
it
up
,
and
handled
it
on
some
occasions
with
considerable
briskness
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
the
most
exasperating
attributes
of
Bounderby
,
that
he
not
only
sang
his
own
praises
but
stimulated
other
men
to
sing
them
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
moral
infection
of
clap
-
trap
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
Strangers
,
modest
enough
elsewhere
,
started
up
at
dinners
in
Coketown
,
and
boasted
,
in
quite
a
rampant
way
,
of
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
They
made
him
out
to
be
the
Royal
arms
,
the
Union
-
Jack
,
Magna
Charta
,
John
Bull
,
Habeas
Corpus
,
the
Bill
of
Rights
,
An
Englishman

house
<EOS>
is
his
castle
,
Church
and
State
,
and
God
save
the
Queen
,
all
put
together
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
often
(
and
it
was
very
often
)
as
an
orator
of
this
kind
brought
into
his
peroration
,
   
<EOS>
"
Princes
and
lords
may
flourish
or
may
fade
,
A
breath
can
make
them
,
as
a
breath
has
made
,
"
   
---
it
was
,
for
certain
,
more
or
less
understood
among
the
company
that
he
had
heard
of
Mrs
Sparsit
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Bounderby
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
you
are
unusually
slow
,
sir
,
with
your
breakfast
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
ma'am
,
"
he
returned
,
"
I
am
thinking
about
Tom
Gradgrind
's
whim
;
"
Tom
Gradgrind
,
for
a
bluff
independent
manner
of
speaking
---
as
if
somebody
were
always
endeavouring
to
bribe
him
with
immense
sums
to
say
Thomas
,
and
he
would
n't
;
"
Tom
Gradgrind
's
whim
,
ma'am
,
of
bringing
up
the
tumbling
-
girl
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
girl
is
now
waiting
to
know
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
whether
she
is
to
go
straight
to
the
school
,
or
up
to
the
Lodge
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
must
wait
,
ma'am
,
"
answered
Bounderby
,
"
till
I
know
myself
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
Tom
Gradgrind
down
here
presently
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
should
wish
her
to
remain
here
a
day
or
two
longer
,
of
course
she
can
,
ma'am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
she
can
if
you
wish
it
,
Mr
Bounderby
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
told
him
I
would
give
her
a
shake
-
down
here
,
last
night
,
in
order
that
he
might
sleep
on
it
before
he
decided
to
let
her
have
any
association
with
Louisa
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Mr
Bounderby
?
 
<EOS>
Very
thoughtful
of
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
's
Coriolanian
nose
underwent
a
slight
expansion
of
the
nostrils
,
and
her
black
eyebrows
contracted
as
she
took
a
sip
of
tea
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
tolerably
clear
to
me
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
"
that
the
little
puss
can
get
small
good
out
of
such
companionship
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
speaking
of
young
Miss
Gradgrind
,
Mr
Bounderby
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
,
I
'm
speaking
of
Louisa

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
observation
being
limited
to
"
little
puss
,
"
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
and
there
being
two
little
girls
in
question
<EOS>
,
I
did
not
know
which
might
be
indicated
by
that
expression

"

repeated
Mr

"

"
You

"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
took
a
little
more
tea
;
and
,
as
she
bent
her
again
contracted
eyebrows
over
her
steaming
cup
,
rather
looked
as
if
her
classical
countenance
were
invoking
the
infernal
gods
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
said
I
was
another
father
to
Tom
---
young
Tom
,
I
mean
,
not
my
friend
Tom
Gradgrind
<EOS>
---
you
might
have
been
nearer
the
mark
.
<EOS>
I
am
going

take
young
Tom

<EOS>
Going

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Indeed

<EOS>
Rather
young

not

sir

"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Spirit
's
"
sir
,
"
in
addressing
Mr
Bounderby
,
was
a
word
of
ceremony
,
rather
exacting
consideration
for
herself
in
the
use
,
than
honouring
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
going
to
take
him
at
once
;
he
is
to
finish
his
educational
cramming
before
then
,
"
said
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
the
Lord
Harry
,
he
'll
have
enough
of
it
,
first
and
last

<EOS>
He
'd
open
his
eyes
,
<EOS>
that
boy
would
,
if
he
knew
how
empty
of
learning
my
young
maw
was
,
at
his
time
of
life

"
 
<EOS>
Which
,
by
the
by
,
he
probably
did
know
,
for
he
had
heard
of
it
often
enough
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
extraordinary
the
difficulty
I
have
on
scores
of
such
subjects
,
in
speaking
to
any
one
on
equal
terms
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
for
example
,
I
have
been
speaking
to
you
this
morning
about
tumblers

<EOS>
Why

what
do
you
know

tumblers

<EOS>
At
the
time
when
,
to
have
been
a
tumbler
in
the
mud
of
the
streets

would
have
been
a
godsend
to
me
,
a
prize
in
the
lottery

,
you
were

out
of
the
Italian
Opera
,
ma'am
,
in
white
satin
and
jewels
,
a
blaze
of
splendour
,
when
I
had
n't
a
penny
to
buy
a
link
to
light
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
,
with
a
dignity
serenely
mournful
,
"
was
familiar
with
the
Italian
Opera
at
a
very
early
age
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Egad
,
ma'am
,
so
was
I
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
"
---
with
the
wrong
side
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
hard
bed
the
pavement
of
its
Arcade
used
to
make
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
People
like
you
,
ma'am
,
accustomed
from
infancy
to
lie
on
Down
feathers
,
have
no
idea
how
hard
a
paving
-
stone
is
,
without
trying
it
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
it
's
of
no
use
my
talking
to
you
about
tumblers
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
speak
of
foreign
dancers
,
and
the
West
End
of
London
,
and
May
Fair
,
and
lords
and
ladies
and
honourables
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
trust
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Mrs
Sparsit
,
with
decent
resignation
,
"
it
is
not
necessary
that
you
should
do
anything
of
that
kind
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
learnt
how
to
accommodate
myself
to
the
changes
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
have
acquired
an
interest
in
hearing
of
your
instructive
experiences
,
and
can
scarcely
hear
enough
of
them
,
I
claim
no
merit
for
that
,
since
I
believe
it
is
a
general
sentiment
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ma'am
,
"
said
her
patron
,
"
perhaps
some
people
may
be
pleased
to
say
that
they
do
like
to
hear
,
<EOS>
in
his
own
unpolished
way
,
what
Josiah
Bounderby
,
of
Coketown
,
has
gone
through
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
must
confess
that
you
were
born
in
the
lap
of
luxury
,
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
ma'am
,
<EOS>
you
know
you
were
born
in
the
lap
of
luxury
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
with
a
shake
of
her
head
,
"
deny
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
was
obliged
to
get
up
from
table
,
and
stand
with
his
back
to
the
fire
,
looking
at
her
;
she
was
such
an
enhancement
of
his
position
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
were
in
crack
society
.
 
<EOS>
Devilish
high
society
,
"
he
said
,
warming
his
legs
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
,
with
an
affectation
of
humility
the
very
opposite
of
his
,
and
therefore
in
no
danger
of
jostling
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
were
in
the
tiptop
fashion
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
,
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
,
with
a
kind
of
social
widowhood
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
unquestionably
true
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
,
bending
himself
at
the
knees
,
literally
embraced
his
legs
in
his
great
satisfaction
and
laughed
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
and
Miss
Gradgrind
being
then
announced
,
he
received
the
former
with
a
shake
of
the
hand
,
and
the
latter
with
a
kiss
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
Jupe
be
sent
here
,
Bounderby
?
"
asked
Mr
Gradgrind
.
   
<EOS>
Certainly
.
 
<EOS>
So
Jupe
was
sent
there
.
 
<EOS>
On
coming
in
,
she
curtseyed
to
Mr
Bounderby
,
and
to
his
friend
Tom
Gradgrind
,
and
also
to
Louisa
;
but
in
her
confusion
unluckily
omitted
Mrs
Sparsit
.
 
<EOS>
Observing
this
,
the
blustrous
Bounderby
had
the
following
remarks
to
make
:
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
tell
you
what
,
my
girl
.
 
<EOS>
The
name
of
that
lady
by
the
teapot
,
is
Mrs
Sparsit
.
 
<EOS>
That
lady
acts
as
mistress
of
this
house
,
and
she
is
a
highly
connected
lady
.
 
<EOS>
Consequently
,
if
ever
you
come
again
into
any
room
in
this
house
,
you
will
make
a
short
stay
in
it
if
you
do
n't
behave
towards
that
lady
in
your
most
respectful
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
do
n't
care
a
button
what
you
do
to
me
,
because
I
do
n't
affect
to
be
anybody
.
 
<EOS>
So
far
from
having
high
connections
I
have
no
connections
at
all
,
and
I
come
of
the
scum
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
But
towards
that
lady
,
I
do
care
what
you
do
;
and
you
shall
do
what
is
deferential
and
respectful
,
or
you
shall
not
come
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
Bounderby
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
in
a
conciliatory
voice
,
"
that
this
was
merely
an
oversight
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
friend
Tom
Gradgrind
suggests
,
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
"
that
this
was
merely
an
oversight
.
 
<EOS>
Very
likely
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
as
you
are
aware
,
ma'am
,
I
do
n't
allow
of
even
oversights
towards
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
good
indeed
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
,
shaking
her
head
with
her
State
humility
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
worth
speaking
of
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sissy
,
who
all
this
time
had
been
faintly
excusing
herself
with
tears
in
her
eyes
,
was
now
waved
over
by
the
master
of
the
house
to
Mr
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
She
stood
looking
intently
at
him
,
and
Louisa
stood
coldly
by
,
with
her
eyes
upon
the
ground
,
while
he
proceeded
thus
:
   
<EOS>
"
Jupe
,
I
have
made
up
my
mind
to
take
you
into
my
house
;
and
,
when
you
are
not
in
attendance
at
the
school
,
to
employ
you
about
Mrs
Gradgrind
,
who
is
rather
an
invalid
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
explained
to
Miss
Louisa
---
this
is
Miss
Louisa
---
the
miserable
but
natural
end
of
your
late
career
;
and
you
are
to
expressly
understand
that
the
whole
of
that
subject
is
past
,
and
is
not
to
be
referred
to
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
time
you
begin
your
history
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
,
at
present
,
ignorant
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
very
,
"
she
answered
,
curtseying
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
the
satisfaction
of
causing
you
to
be
strictly
educated
;
and
you
will
be
a
living
proof
to
all
who
come
into
communication
with
you
,
of
the
advantages
of
the
training
you
will
receive
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
be
reclaimed
and
formed
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
been
in
the
habit
now
of
reading
to
your
father
,
and
those
people
I
found
you
among
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
?
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
beckoning
her
nearer
to
him
before
he
said
so
,
and
dropping
his
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Only
to
father
and
Merrylegs
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
At
least
I
mean
to
father
,
when
Merrylegs
was
always
there
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
Merrylegs
,
Jupe
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
with
a
passing
frown
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
ask
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
understand
you
to
have
been
in
the
habit
of
reading
to
your
father
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
,
yes
,
sir
,
thousands
of
times
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
the
happiest
---
<EOS>
O
,
of
all
the
happy
times
we
had
together
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
only
now
when
her
sorrow
broke
out
,
that
Louisa
looked
at
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
,
"
asked
Mr
Gradgrind
,
in
a
still
lower
voice
,
"
did
you
read
to
your
father
,
Jupe
?
"
   
"
<EOS>
About
the
Fairies
,
sir
,
and
the
Dwarf
,
and
the
Hunchback
,
and
the
Genies
,
"
she
sobbed
out
;
"
and
about
---
"
   
"
Hush
!
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
"
that
is
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Never
breathe
a
word
of
such
destructive
nonsense
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
Bounderby
,
this
is
a
case
for
rigid
training
,
and
I
shall
observe
it
with
interest
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
returned
Mr
Bounderby
,
"
I
have
given
you
my
opinion
already
,
and
I
should
n't
do
as
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
very
well
,
very
well
.
<EOS>
Since
you
are
bent
upon
it
,
very
well
!
"
   
<EOS>
So
,
Mr
Gradgrind
and
his
daughter
took
Cecilia
Jupe
off
with
them
to
Stone
Lodge
,
and
on
the
way
Louisa
never
spoke
one
word
,
good
or
bad
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mr
Bounderby
went
about
his
daily
pursuits
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mrs
Sparsit
got
behind
her
eyebrows
and
meditated
in
the
gloom
of
that
retreat
,
all
the
evening
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
08
.
<EOS>
Never
Wonder
 
<EOS>
Let
us
strike
the
key
-
note
again
,
before
pursuing
the
tune
.
   
<EOS>
When
she
was
half
a
dozen
years
younger
,
Louisa
had
been
overheard
to
begin
a
conversation
with
her
brother
one
day
,
by
saying
"
Tom
,
I
wonder
"
---
upon
which
Mr
Gradgrind
,
who
was
the
person
overhearing
,
stepped
forth
into
the
light
and
said
,
"
Louisa
,
never
wonder
!
"
   
<EOS>
Herein
lay
the
spring
of
the
mechanical
art
and
mystery
of
educating
the
reason
without
stooping
to
the
cultivation
of
the
sentiments
and
affections
.
 
<EOS>
Never
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
By
means
of
addition
,
subtraction
,
multiplication
,
and
division
,
settle
everything
somehow
,
and
never
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
Bring
to
me
,
says
M'Choakumchild
,
yonder
baby
just
able
to
walk
,
and
I
will
engage
that
it
shall
never
wonder
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
besides
very
many
babies
just
able
to
walk
,
there
happened
to
be
in
Coketown
a
considerable
population
of
babies
who
had
been
walking
against
time
towards
the
infinite
world
,
twenty
,
thirty
,
forty
,
fifty
years
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
These
portentous
infants
being
alarming
creatures
to
stalk
about
in
any
human
society
,
the
eighteen
denominations
incessantly
scratched
one
another
's
faces
and
pulled
one
another
's
hair
by
way
of
agreeing
on
the
steps
to
be
taken
for
their
improvement
---
which
they
never
did
;
a
surprising
circumstance
,
when
the
happy
adaptation
of
the
means
to
the
end
is
considered
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
although
they
differed
in
every
other
particular
,
conceivable
and
inconceivable
(
especially
inconceivable
)
,
they
were
pretty
well
united
on
the
point
that
these
unlucky
infants
were
never
to
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
Body
number
one
,
said
they
must
take
everything
on
trust
.
 
<EOS>
Body
number
two
,
said
they
must
take
everything
on
political
economy
.
 
<EOS>
Body
number
three
,
wrote
leaden
little
books
for
them
,
showing
how
the
good
grown
-
up
baby
invariably
got
to
the
Savings
-
bank
,
and
the
bad
grown
-
up
baby
invariably
got
transported
.
 
<EOS>
Body
number
four
,
under
dreary
pretences
of
being
droll
(
when
it
was
very
melancholy
indeed
)
,
made
the
shallowest
pretences
of
concealing
pitfalls
of
knowledge
,
into
which
it
was
the
duty
of
these
babies
to
be
smuggled
and
inveigled
.
<EOS>
But
,
all
the
bodies
agreed
that
they
were
never
to
wonder
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
library
in
Coketown
,
to
which
general
access
was
easy
.
<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
greatly
tormented
his
mind
about
what
the
people
read
in
this
library
:
 
<EOS>
a
point
whereon
little
rivers
of
tabular
statements
periodically
flowed
into
the
howling
ocean
of
tabular
statements
,
which
no
diver
ever
got
to
any
depth
in
and
came
up
sane
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
disheartening
circumstance
,
but
a
melancholy
fact
,
that
even
these
readers
persisted
in
wondering
.
 
<EOS>
They
wondered
about
human
nature
,
human
passions
,
human
hopes
and
fears
,
the
struggles
,
triumphs
and
defeats
,
the
cares
and
joys
and
sorrows
,
the
lives
and
deaths
of
common
men
and
women
!
 
<EOS>
They
sometimes
,
after
fifteen
hours
'
work
,
sat
down
to
read
mere
fables
about
men
and
women
,
more
or
less
like
themselves
,
and
about
children
,
more
or
less
like
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
They
took
De
Foe
to
their
bosoms
,
instead
of
Euclid
,
and
seemed
to
be
on
the
whole
more
comforted
by
Goldsmith
than
by
Cocker
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
was
for
ever
working
,
in
print
and
out
of
print
,
at
this
eccentric
sum
,
and
he
never
could
make
out
how
it
yielded
this
unaccountable
product
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sick
of
my
life
,
Loo
.
 
<EOS>
I
,
hate
it
altogether
,
and
I
hate
everybody
except
you
,
"
said
the
unnatural
young
Thomas
Gradgrind
in
the
hair
-
cutting
chamber
at
twilight
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
hate
Sissy
,
Tom
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hate
to
be
obliged
to
call
her
Jupe
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
hates
me
,
"
said
Tom
,
moodily
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
she
does
not
,
Tom
,
I
am
sure
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
must
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
must
just
hate
and
detest
the
whole
set
-
out
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
They
'll
bother
her
head
off
,
I
think
,
before
they
have
done
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
Already
she
's
getting
as
pale
as
wax
,
and
as
heavy
as
<EOS>
---
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
Young
Thomas
expressed
these
sentiments
sitting
astride
of
a
chair
before
the
fire
,
with
his
arms
on
the
back
,
and
his
sulky
face
on
his
arms
.
 
<EOS>
His
sister
sat
in
the
darker
corner
by
the
fireside
,
now
looking
at
him
,
now
looking
at
the
bright
sparks
as
they
dropped
upon
the
hearth
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
me
,
"
said
Tom
,
tumbling
his
hair
all
manner
of
ways
with
his
sulky
hands
,
"
I
am
a
Donkey
,
that
's
what
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
as
obstinate
as
one
<EOS>
,
I
am
more
stupid
than
one
,
I
get
as
much
pleasure
as
one
,
and
I
should
like
to
kick
like
one
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
me
,
I
hope
,
Tom
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Loo
;
I
would
n't
hurt
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
an
exception
of
you
at
first

<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
this

jolly
old

Jaundiced
Jail
,
"
Tom
had
paused
to
find
a
sufficiently
complimentary
and
expressive
name
for
the
parental
roof
,
and
seemed
to
relieve
his
mind
for
a
moment
by
the
strong
alliteration
of
this
one
,
"
would
be
without
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
Tom
?
 
<EOS>
Do
you
really
and
truly
say
so
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
of
course
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
the
use
of
talking
about
it
!
"
<EOS>
returned
Tom
,
chafing
his
face
on
his
coat
-
sleeve
,
as
if
to
mortify
his
flesh
,
and
have
it
in
unison
with
his
spirit
.
   
<EOS>
"
Because
,
Tom
,
"
said
his
sister
,
after
silently
watching
the
sparks
awhile
,
"
as
I
get
older
,
and
nearer
growing
up
,
I
often
sit
wondering
here
,
and
think
how
unfortunate
it
is
for
me
that
I
ca
n't
reconcile
you
to
home
better
than
I
am
able
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
other
girls
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
play
to
you
,
or
sing
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
talk
to
you
so
as
to
lighten
your
mind
,
for
I
never
see
any
amusing
sights
or
read
any
amusing
books
that
it
would
be
a
pleasure
or
a
relief
to
you
to
talk
about
,
when
you
are
tired
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
no
more
do
I.
 
I
am
as
bad
as
you
in
that
respect
;
and
I
am
a
Mule
too
,
which
you
're
not
.
 
<EOS>
If
father
was
determined
to
make
me
either
a
Prig
or
a
Mule
,
and
I
am
not
a
Prig
<EOS>
,
why
,
it
stands
to
reason
,
I
must
be
a
Mule
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
I
am
,
"
said
Tom
,
desperately
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
great
pity
,
"
said
Louisa
,
after
another
pause
,
and
speaking
thoughtfully
out
of
her
dark
corner
:
 
<EOS>
"
it
's
a
great
pity
,
Tom
.
<EOS>
It
's
very
unfortunate
for
both
of
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
You
,
"
said
Tom
;
"
you
are
a
girl
,
Loo
,
and
a
girl
<EOS>
comes
out
of
it
better
than
a
boy
does
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
miss
anything
in
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
the
only
pleasure
I
have
<EOS>
---
you
can
brighten
even
this
place
---
and
you
can
always
lead
me
as
you
like
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
dear
brother
,
Tom
;
and
while
you
think
I
can
do
such
things
,
I
do
n't
<EOS>
so
much
mind
knowing
better
.
 
<EOS>
Though
I
do
know
better
,
Tom
,
and
am
very
sorry
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
came
and
kissed
him
,
and
went
back
into
her
corner
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
collect
all
the
Facts
we
hear
so
much
about
,
"
said
Tom
,
spitefully
setting
his
teeth
,
"
and
all
the
Figures
,
and
all
the
people
who
found
them
out
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
wish
I
could
put
a
thousand
barrels
of
gunpowder
under
them
,
and
blow
them
all
up
together
!
<EOS>
However
,
when
I
go
to
live
with
old
Bounderby
,
I
'll
have
my
revenge
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
revenge
,
Tom
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
I
'll
enjoy
myself
a
little
,
and
go
about
and
see
something
,
and
hear
something
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
recompense
myself
for
the
way
in
which
I
have
been
brought
up
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
do
n't
disappoint
yourself
beforehand
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
thinks
as
father
thinks
,
and
is
a
great
deal
rougher
,
and
not
half
so
kind
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Tom
,
laughing
;
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mind
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
very
well
know
how
to
manage
and
smooth
old
Bounderby
!
"
   
<EOS>
Their
shadows
were
defined
upon
the
wall
,
but
those
of
the
high
presses
in
the
room
were
all
blended
together
on
the
wall
and
on
the
ceiling
,
as
if
the
brother
and
sister
were
overhung
by
a
dark
cavern
.
 
<EOS>
Or
,
a
fanciful
imagination
<EOS>
---
if
such
treason
could
have
been
there
---
might
have
made
it
out
to
be
the
shadow
of
their
subject
,
and
of
its
lowering
association
with
their
future
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
great
mode
of
smoothing
and
managing
,
Tom
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
a
secret
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Tom
,
"
if
it
is
a
secret
,
it
's
not
far
off
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
his
little
pet
,
you
are
his
favourite
;
he
'll
do
anything
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
says
to
me
what
I
do
n't
like
,
I
shall
say
to
him
,
"
My
sister
Loo
will
be
hurt
and
disappointed
,
Mr
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
She
always
used
to
tell
me
she
was
sure
you
would
be
easier
with
me
than
this
.
"
 
<EOS>
That
'll
bring
him
about
,
or
nothing
will
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
waiting
for
some
answering
remark
,
and
getting
none
,
Tom
wearily
relapsed
into
the
present
time
,
and
twined
himself
yawning
round
and
about
the
rails
of
his
chair
,
and
rumpled
his
head
more
and
more
,
until
he
suddenly
looked
up
,
and
asked
:
   
"
Have
you
gone
to
sleep
,
Loo
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
looking
at
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
find
more
to
look
at
in
it
than
ever
I
could
find
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Another
of
the
advantages
,
I
suppose
,
of
being
a
girl
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
"
enquired
his
sister
,
slowly
,
and
in
a
curious
tone
,
as
if
she
were
reading
what
she
asked
in
the
fire
,
and
it
was
not
quite
plainly
written
there
,
"
do
you
look
forward
with
any
satisfaction
to
this
change
to
Mr
Bounderby
's
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
there
's
one
thing
to
be
said
of
it
,
"
returned
Tom
,
pushing
his
chair
from
him
,
and
standing
up
;
"
it
will
be
getting
away
from
home
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
one
thing
to
be
said
of
it
,
"
Louisa
repeated
in
her
former
curious
tone
;
"
it
will
be
getting
away
from
home
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
but
what
I
shall
be
very
unwilling
,
both
to
leave
you
,
Loo
,
and
to
leave
you
here
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
must
go
,
you
know
,
whether
I
like
it
or
not
;
and
I
had
better
go
where
I
can
take
with
me
some
advantage
of
your
influence
,
than
where
I
should
lose
it
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Tom
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
answer
was
so
long
in
coming
,
though
there
was
no
indecision
in
it
,
that
Tom
went
and
leaned
on
the
back
of
her
chair
,
to
contemplate
the
fire
which
so
engrossed
her
,
from
her
point
of
view
,
and
see
what
he
could
make
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Except
that
it
is
a
fire
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
it
looks
to
me
as
stupid
and
blank
as
everything
else
looks
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
see
in
it
?
 
<EOS>
Not
a
circus
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
anything
in
it
,
Tom
,
particularly
.
 
<EOS>
But
since
I
have
been
looking
at
it
,
I
have
been
wondering
about
you
and
me
,
grown
up
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wondering
again
!
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
such
unmanageable
thoughts
,
"
returned
his
sister
,
"
that
they
will
wonder
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
beg
of
you
,
Louisa
,
"
said
Mrs
Gradgrind
,
who
had
opened
the
door
without
being
heard
,
"
to
do
nothing
of
that
description
,
for
goodness
'
sake
,
you
inconsiderate
girl
,
or
I
shall
never
hear
the
last
of
it
from
your
father
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
Thomas
,
it
is
really
shameful
,
with
my
poor
head
continually
wearing
me
out
,
that
a
boy
brought
up
as
you
have
been
,
and
whose
education
has
cost
what
yours
has
<EOS>
,
should
be
found
encouraging
his
sister
to
wonder
,
when
he
knows
his
father
has
expressly
said
that
she
is
not
to
do
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Louisa
denied
Tom
's
participation
in
the
offence
;
but
her
mother
stopped
her
with
the
conclusive
answer
,
"
Louisa
,
do
n't
tell
me
,
in
my
state
of
health
;
for
unless
you
had
been
encouraged
,
it
is
morally
and
physically
impossible
that
you
could
have
done
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
encouraged
by
nothing
,
mother
,
but
by
looking
at
the
red
sparks
dropping
out
of
the
fire
,
and
whitening
and
dying
.
 
<EOS>
It
made
me
think
,
after
all
,
how
short
my
life
would
be
,
and
how
little
I
could
hope
to
do
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
"
said
Mrs
Gradgrind
,
rendered
almost
energetic
.
"
<EOS>
Nonsense
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
stand
there
and
tell
me
such
stuff
,
Louisa
,
to
my
face
,
when
you
know
very
well
that
if
it
was
ever
to
reach
your
father
's
ears
I
should
never
hear
the
last
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
After
all
the
trouble
that
has
been
taken
with
you
!
 
<EOS>
After
the
lectures
you
have
attended
,
and
the
experiments
you
have
seen
!
 
<EOS>
After
I
have
heard
you
myself
,
when
the
whole
of
my
right
side
has
been
benumbed
,
going
on
with
your
master
about
combustion
,
and
calcination
,
and
calorification
,
and
I
may
say
every
kind
of
ation
that
could
drive
a
poor
invalid
distracted
,
to
hear
you
talking
in
this
absurd
way
about
sparks
and
ashes
!
 
<EOS>
I
wish
,
"
whimpered
Mrs
Gradgrind
,
taking
a
chair
,
and
discharging
her
strongest
point
before
succumbing
under
these
mere
shadows
of
facts
,
"
<EOS>
yes
,
I
really
do
wish
that
I
had
never
had
a
family
,
and
then
you
would
have
known
what
it
was
to
do
without
me

<EOS>
Sissy
's
Progress
 
Sissy
Jupe
had
not
an
easy
time
of
it
,
between
Mr
M'Choakumchild
and
Mrs
Gradgrind
,
and
was
not
without
strong
impulses
,
in
the
first
months
of
her
probation
,
to
run
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
hailed
facts
all
day
long
so
very
hard
,
and
life
in
general
was
opened
to
her
as
such
a
closely
ruled
ciphering
-
book
,
that
assuredly
she
would
have
run
away
,
but
for
only
one
restraint
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
lamentable
to
think
of
;
but
this
restraint
was
the
result
of
no
arithmetical
process
,
was
self
-
imposed
in
defiance
of
all
calculation
,
and
went
dead
against
any
table
of
probabilities
that
any
Actuary
would
have
drawn
up
from
the
premises
.
 
<EOS>
The
girl
believed
that
her
father
had
not
deserted
her
;
she
lived
in
the
hope
that
he
would
come
back
,
and
in
the
faith
that
he
would
be
made
the
happier
by
her
remaining
where
she
was
.
   
<EOS>
The
wretched
ignorance
with
which
Jupe
clung
to
this
consolation
,
rejecting
the
superior
comfort
of
knowing
,
on
a
sound
arithmetical
basis
,
that
her
father
was
an
unnatural
vagabond
,
filled
Mr
Gradgrind
with
pity
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
what
was
to
be
done
?
 
<EOS>
M'Choakumchild
reported
that
she
had
a
very
dense
head
for
figures
;
that
,
once
possessed
with
a
general
idea
of
the
globe
,
she
took
the
smallest
conceivable
interest
in
its
exact
measurements
;
that
she
was
extremely
slow
in
the
acquisition
of
dates
,
unless
some
pitiful
incident
happened
to
be
connected
therewith
;
that
she
would
burst
into
tears
on
being
required
(
by
the
mental
process
)
immediately
to
name
the
cost
of
two
hundred
and
forty
-
seven
muslin
caps
at
fourteen
-
pence
halfpenny
;
that
she
was
as
low
down
,
in
the
school
,
as
low
could
be
;
that
after
eight
weeks
of
induction
into
the
elements
of
Political
Economy
,
she
had
only
yesterday
been
set
right
by
a
prattler
three
feet
high
,
for
returning
to
the
question
,
"
What
is
the
first
principle
of
this
science
?
"
<EOS>
the
absurd
answer
,
"
To
do
unto
others
as
I
would
that
they
should
do
unto
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
observed
,
shaking
his
head
,
that
all
this
was
very
bad
;
that
it
showed
the
necessity
of
infinite
grinding
at
the
mill
of
knowledge
,
as
per
system
,
schedule
,
blue
book
,
report
,
and
tabular
statements
A^
to
Z^
;
and
that
Jupe
"
must
be
kept
to
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
Jupe
was
kept
to
it
,
and
became
low
-
spirited
,
but
no
wiser
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
a
fine
thing
to
be
you
,
Miss
Louisa
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
one
night
,
when
Louisa
had
endeavoured
to
make
her
perplexities
for
next
day
something
clearer
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
so
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
know
so
much
,
Miss
Louisa
.
 
<EOS>
All
that
is
difficult
to
me
now
,
would
be
so
easy
then
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
might
not
be
the
better
for
it
,
Sissy
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sissy
submitted
,
after
a
little
hesitation
,
"
I
should
not
be
the
worse
,
Miss
Louisa
.
"
 
<EOS>
To
which
Miss
Louisa
answered
,
"
I
do
n't
know
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
had
been
so
little
communication
between
these
two
---
<EOS>
both
because
life
at
Stone
Lodge
went
monotonously
round
like
a
piece
of
machinery
which
discouraged
human
interference
,
and
because
of
the
prohibition
relative
to
Sissy
's
past
career
---
that
they
were
still
almost
strangers
.
 
<EOS>
Sissy
,
with
her
dark
eyes
wonderingly
directed
to
Louisa
's
face
,
was
uncertain
whether
to
say
more
or
to
remain

You

Louisa
resumed

You

Miss

Sissy
pleaded

I

O
so
stupid
!

<EOS>
Louisa
,
with
a
brighter
laugh
than
usual
,
told
her
she
would
be
wiser
by
-
and
-
by
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know

"
said
Sissy
,
half
crying
,
"
what
a
stupid
girl
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
All
through
school
hours
I
make
mistakes
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
M'Choakumchild
call
me
up
,
over
and
over
again
,
regularly
to
make
mistakes
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
help
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
seem
to
come
natural
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
and
Mrs
M'Choakumchild
never
make
any
mistakes
themselves
,
I
suppose
,
Sissy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
no
!
<EOS>
"
she
eagerly
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
know
everything
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
some
of
your
mistakes

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
almost
ashamed

"
said
Sissy
,
with
reluctance
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
to
-
day
,
for
instance
,
Mr
M'Choakumchild
was
explaining
to
us
about
Natural
Prosperity
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
National
,
I
think
it
must
have
been
,
"
observed
Louisa
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
was
.
<EOS>
---
But
is
n't
it
the
same
?
<EOS>
"
she
timidly
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
say
,
National
,
as
he
said
so
,
"
returned
Louisa
,
with
her
dry
reserve
.
   
<EOS>
"
National
Prosperity
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
said
,
Now
,
this
schoolroom
is
a
Nation
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
this
nation
,
there
are
fifty
millions
of
money
.
<EOS>
Is
n't
this
a
prosperous
nation
?
 
<EOS>
Girl
number
twenty
,
is
n't
this
a
prosperous
nation
,
and
a'n't
you
in
a
thriving
state
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
say
?
"
asked
Louisa
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Louisa
,
I
said
I
did
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
I
could
n't
know
whether
it
was
a
prosperous
nation
or
not
,
and
whether
I
was
in
a
thriving
state
or
not
,
unless
I
knew
who
had
got
the
money
,
and
whether
any
of
it
was
mine
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
in
the
figures
at
all
,
"
said
Sissy
,
wiping
her
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
was
a
great
mistake
of
yours
,
"
observed
Louisa
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
Miss
Louisa
,
I
know
it
was
,
now
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Mr
M'Choakumchild
said
he
would
try
me
again
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
said
,
This
schoolroom
is
an
immense
town
,
and
in
it
there
are
a
million
of
inhabitants
,
and
only
five
-
and
-
twenty
are
starved
to
death
in
the
streets
,
in
the
course
of
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
your
remark
on
that
proportion
?
 
<EOS>
And
my
remark
was
---
for
I
could
n't
think
of
a
better
one
---
that
I
thought
it
must
be
just
as
hard
upon
those
who
were
starved
,
whether
the
others
were
a
million
,
or
a
million
million
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
was
wrong
,
too
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
Mr
M'Choakumchild
said
he
would
try
me
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
said
,
Here
are
the
stutterings
---
"
   
"
Statistics
,
"
said
Louisa
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Miss
Louisa
---
they
always
remind
me
of
stutterings
,
and
that
's
another
of
my
mistakes
---
of
accidents
upon
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
find
(
Mr
M'Choakumchild
said
)
that
in
a
given
time
a
hundred
thousand
persons
went
to
sea
on
long
voyages
,
and
only
five
hundred
of
them
were
drowned
or
burnt
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
the
percentage
?
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
Miss
;
"
here
Sissy
fairly
sobbed
as
confessing
with
extreme
contrition
to
her
greatest
error
;
"
I
said
it
was
nothing
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
Sissy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
Miss
---
to
the
relations
and
friends
of
the
people
who
were
killed
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
learn
,
"
said
Sissy
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
the
worst
of
all
is
,
that
although
my
poor
father
wished
me
so
much
to
learn
,
and
although
I
am
so
anxious
to
learn
,
because
he
wished
me
to
,
I
am
afraid
I
do
n't
like
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Louisa
stood
looking
at
the
pretty
modest
head
,
as
it
drooped
abashed
before
her
,
until
it
was
raised
again
to
glance
at
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
asked
:
   
"
Did
your
father
know
so
much
himself
,
that
he
wished
you
to
be
well
taught
too
,
Sissy
?
"
   
<EOS>
Sissy
hesitated
before
replying
,
and
so
plainly
showed
her
sense
that
they
were
entering
on
forbidden
ground
,
that
Louisa
added
,
"
No
one
hears
us
;
and
if
any
one
did
,
I
am
sure
no
harm
could
be
found
in
such
an
innocent
question
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Miss
Louisa
,
"
answered
Sissy
,
upon
this
encouragement
,
shaking
her
head
;
"
father
knows
very
little
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
as
much
as
he
can
do
to
write
;
and
it
's
more
than
people
in
general
can
do
to
read
his
writing
.
 
<EOS>
Though
it
's
plain
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
mother
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Father
says
she
was
quite
a
scholar
.
 
<EOS>
She
died
when
I
was
born
.
<EOS>
She
was
;
"
Sissy
made
the
terrible
communication
nervously
;
"
she
was
a
dancer
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
your
father
love
her
?
"
 
<EOS>
Louisa
asked
these
questions
with
a
strong
,
wild
,
wandering
interest
peculiar
to
her
;
an
interest
gone
astray
like
a
banished
creature
,
and
hiding
in
solitary
places
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
O
yes
!
 
<EOS>
As
dearly
as
he
loves
me
.
 
<EOS>
Father
loved
me
,
first
,
for
her
sake
.
 
<EOS>
He
carried
me
about
with
him
when
I
was
quite
a
baby
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
never
been
asunder
from
that
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yet
he
leaves
you
now
,
Sissy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
for
my
good
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
understands
him
as
I
do
;
nobody
knows
him
as
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
left
me
for
my
good
---
he
never
would
have
left
me
for
his
own
---
<EOS>
I
know
he
was
almost
broken
-
hearted
with
the
trial
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
not
be
happy
for
a
single
minute
,
till
he
comes
back
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
more
about
him
,
"
said
Louisa
,
"
I
will
never
ask
you
again
.
<EOS>
Where
did
you
live
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
travelled
about
the
country
,
and
had
no
fixed
place
to
live
in
.
<EOS>
Father
's
a
;
"
Sissy
whispered
the
awful
word
,
"
a
clown
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
make
the
people
laugh
?
"
said
Louisa
,
with
a
nod
of
intelligence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
would
n't
laugh
sometimes
,
and
then
father
cried
.
<EOS>
Lately
,
they
very
often
would
n't
laugh
,
and
he
used
to
come
home
despairing
.
 
<EOS>
Father
's
not
like
most
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
did
n't
know
him
as
well
as
I
do
,
and
did
n't
love
him
as
dearly
as
I
do
,
might
believe
he
was
not
quite
right
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
they
played
tricks
upon
him
;
but
they
never
knew
how
he
felt
them
,
and
shrunk
up
,
when
he
was
alone
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
far
,
far
timider
than
they
thought
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
you
were
his
comfort
through
everything
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
nodded
,
with
the
tears
rolling
down
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
and
father
said
I
was
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
because
he
grew
so
scared
and
trembling
,
and
because
he
felt
himself
to
be
a
poor
,
weak
,
ignorant
,
helpless
man
(
those
used
to
be
his
words
)
,
that
he
wanted
me
so
much
to
know
a
great
deal
,
and
be
different
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
used
to
read
to
him
to
cheer
his
courage
,
and
he
was
very
fond
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
wrong
books
<EOS>
---
I
am
never
to
speak
of
them
here
---
but
we
did
n't
know
there
was
any
harm
in
them
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
he
liked
them
?
"
<EOS>
said
Louisa
,
with
a
searching
gaze
on
Sissy
all
this
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
O
very
much
!
 
<EOS>
They
kept
him
,
many
times
,
from
what
did
him
real
harm
.
 
<EOS>
And
often
and
often
of
a
night
,
he
used
to
forget
all
his
troubles
in
wondering
whether
the
Sultan
would
let
the
lady
go
on
with
the
story
,
or
would
have
her
head
cut
off
before
it
was
finished
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
your
father
was
always
kind
?
 
<EOS>
To
the
last
?
"
asked
Louisa
contravening
the
great
principle
,
and
wondering
very
much
.
   
<EOS>
"
Always
,
always
!
"
returned
Sissy
,
clasping
her
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
Kinder
and
kinder
than
I
can
tell
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
angry
only
one
night
,
and
that
was
not
to
me
,
but
Merrylegs
.
 
<EOS>
Merrylegs
<EOS>
;
"
she
whispered
the
awful
fact
;
"
is
his
performing
dog
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
was
he
angry
with
the
dog
?
"
<EOS>
Louisa
demanded
.
   
<EOS>
"
Father
,
soon
after
they
came
home
from
performing
,
told
Merrylegs
to
jump
up
on
the
backs
of
the
two
chairs
and
stand
across
them
---
which
is
one
of
his
tricks
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
at
father
,
and
did
n't
do
it
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
of
father
's
had
gone
wrong
that
night
,
and
he
had
n't
pleased
the
public
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
He
cried
out
that
the
very
dog
knew
he
was
failing
,
and
had
no
compassion
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
beat
the
dog
,
and
I
was
frightened
,
and
said
,
"
Father
,
father
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
do
n't
hurt
the
creature
who
is
so
fond
of
you
!
 
<EOS>
O
Heaven
forgive
you
,
father
,
stop
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
stopped
,
and
the
dog
was
bloody
,
and
father
lay
down
crying
on
the
floor
with
the
dog
in
his
arms
,
and
the
dog
licked
his
face
.
"
   
<EOS>
Louisa
saw
that
she
was
sobbing
;
and
going
to
her
,
kissed
her
,
took
her
hand
,
and
sat
down
beside
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Finish
by
telling
me
how
your
father
left
you
,
Sissy
.
 
<EOS>
Now
that
I
have
asked
you
so
much
,
tell
me
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
The
blame
,
if
there
is
any
blame
,
is
mine
,
not
yours
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Miss
Louisa
,
"
said
Sissy
,
covering
her
eyes
,
and
sobbing
yet
;
"
I
came
home
from
the
school
that
afternoon
,
and
found
poor
father
just
come
home
too
,
from
the
booth
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
sat
rocking
himself
over
the
fire
,
as
if
he
was
in
pain
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
"
Have
you
hurt
yourself
,
father
?
<EOS>
"
(
as
he
did
sometimes
,
like
they
all
did
)
,
and
he
said
,
"
A
little
,
my
darling
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
when
I
came
to
stoop
down
and
look
up
at
his
face
,
I
saw
that
he
was
crying
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
I
spoke
to
him
,
the
more
he
hid
his
face
;
and
at
first
he
shook
all
over
,
and
said
nothing
but
"
<EOS>
My
darling
;
"
and
"
My
love
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Tom
came
lounging
in
,
and
stared
at
the
two
with
a
coolness
not
particularly
savouring
of
interest
in
anything
but
himself
,
and
not
much
of
that
at
present
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
asking
Sissy
a
few
questions
,
Tom
,
"
observed
his
sister
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
occasion
to
go
away
;
but
do
n't
interrupt
us
for
a
moment
,
<EOS>
Tom
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
very
well
!
"
returned
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Only
father
has
brought
old
Bounderby
home
,
and
I
want
you
to
come
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Because
if
you
come
,
there
's
a
good
chance
of
old
Bounderby
's
asking
me
to
dinner
;
and
if
you
do
n't
,
there
's
none
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
come
directly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
wait
for
you
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
to
make
sure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Sissy
resumed
in
a
lower
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
last
poor
father
said
that
he
had
given
no
satisfaction
again
,
and
never
did
give
any
satisfaction
now
,
and
that
he
was
a
shame
and
disgrace
,
and
I
should
have
done
better
without
him
all
along
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
all
the
affectionate
things
to
him
that
came
into
my
heart
,
and
presently
he
was
quiet
and
I
sat
down
by
him
,
and
told
him
all
about
the
school
and
everything
that
had
been
said
and
done
there
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
had
no
more
left
to
tell
,
he
put
his
arms
round
my
neck
,
and
kissed
me
a
great
many
times
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
asked
me
to
fetch
some
of
the
stuff
he
used
,
for
the
little
hurt
he
had
had
,
and
to
get
it
at
the
best
place
,
which
was
at
the
other
end
of
town
from
there
;
and
then
,
after
kissing
me
again
,
he
let
me
go
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
had
gone
down
-
stairs
,
I
turned
back
that
I
might
be
a
little
bit
more
company
to
him
yet
,
and
looked
in
at
the
door
,
and
said
,
"
Father
dear
,
shall
I
take
Merrylegs
?
"
 
<EOS>
Father
shook
his
head
and
said
,
"
No
,
Sissy
,
no
;
take
nothing
that
's
known
to
be
mine
,
my
darling
;
"
and
I
left
him
sitting
by
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
thought
must
have
come
upon
him
,
poor
,
poor
father
!
<EOS>
of
going
away
to
try
something
for
my
sake
;
for
when
I
came
back
,
he
was
gone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
!
 
<EOS>
Look
sharp
for
old
Bounderby
,
Loo
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tom
remonstrated
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
more
to
tell
,
Miss
Louisa
.
 
<EOS>
I
keep
the
nine
oils
ready
for
him
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
he
will
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
Every
letter
that
I
see
in
Mr
Gradgrind
's
hand
takes
my
breath
away
and
blinds
my
eyes
,
for
I
think
it
comes
from
father
,
or
from
Mr
Sleary
about
father
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sleary
promised
to
write
as
soon
as
ever
father
should
be
heard
of
,
and
I
trust
to
him
to
keep
his
word
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
look
sharp
for
old
Bounderby
,
Loo
!
"
said
Tom
,
with
an
impatient
whistle
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
'll
be
off
if
you
do
n't
look
sharp
!
"
   
<EOS>
After
this
,
whenever
Sissy
dropped
a
curtsey
to
Mr
Gradgrind
in
the
presence
of
his
family
,
and
said
in
a
faltering
way
,
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
for
being
troublesome
---
but
---
have
you
had
any
letter
yet
about
me
?
"
 
Louisa
would
suspend
the
occupation
of
the
moment
,
whatever
it
was
,
and
look
for
the
reply
as
earnestly
as
Sissy
did
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
Mr
Gradgrind
regularly
answered
,
"
No
,
Jupe
,
nothing
of
the
sort
,
"
the
trembling
of
Sissy
's
lip
would
be
repeated
in
Louisa
's
face
,
and
her
eyes
would
follow
Sissy
with
compassion
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
usually
improved
these
occasions
by
remarking
,
when
she
was
gone
,
that
if
Jupe
had
been
properly
trained
from
an
early
age
she
would
have
remonstrated
to
herself
on
sound
principles
the
baselessness
of
these
fantastic
hopes
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
it
did
seem
(
though
not
to
him
,
for
he
saw
nothing
of
it
)
as
if
fantastic
hope
could
take
as
strong
a
hold
as
Fact
.
   
<EOS>
This
observation
must
be
limited
exclusively
to
his
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
Tom
,
he
was
becoming
that
not
unprecedented
triumph
of
calculation
which
is
usually
at
work
on
number
one
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
Mrs
Gradgrind
,
if
she
said
anything
on
the
subject
,
she
would
come
a
little
way
out
of
her
wrappers
,
like
a
feminine
dormouse
,
and
say
:
   
"
Good
gracious
bless
me
,
how
my
poor
head
is
vexed
and
worried
by
that
girl
Jupe
's
so
perseveringly
asking
,
over
and
over
again
,
about
her
tiresome
letters
!
 
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
and
honour
I
seem
to
be
fated
,
and
destined
,
and
ordained
,
to
live
in
the
midst
of
things
that
I
am
never
to
hear
the
last
of
.
 
<EOS>
It
really
is
a
most
extraordinary
circumstance
that
it
appears
as
if
I
never
was
to
hear
the
last
of
anything
!
"
   
<EOS>
At
about
this
point
,
Mr
Gradgrind
's
eye
would
fall
upon
her
;
and
under
the
influence
of
that
wintry
piece
of
fact
,
she
would
become
torpid
again
.

Stephen
Blackpool
 
<EOS>
I
entertain
a
weak
idea
that
the
English
people
are
as
hard
-
worked
as
any
people
upon
whom
the
sun
shines
.
 
<EOS>
I
acknowledge
to
this
ridiculous
idiosyncrasy
,
as
a
reason
why
I
would
give
them
a
little
more
play
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
hardest
working
part
of
Coketown
;
in
the
innermost
fortifications
of
that
ugly
citadel
,
where
Nature
was
as
strongly
bricked
out
as
killing
airs
and
gases
were
bricked
in
;
at
the
heart
of
the
labyrinth
of
narrow
courts
upon
courts
,
and
close
streets
upon
streets
,
which
had
come
into
existence
piecemeal
,
every
piece
in
a
violent
hurry
for
some
one
man
's
purpose
,
and
the
whole
an
unnatural
family
,
shouldering
,
and
trampling
,
and
pressing
one
another
to
death
;
in
the
last
close
nook
of
this
great
exhausted
receiver
,
where
the
chimneys
,
for
want
of
air
to
make
a
draught
,
were
built
in
an
immense
variety
of
stunted
and
crooked
shapes
,
as
though
every
house
put
out
a
sign
of
the
kind
of
people
who
might
be
expected
to
be
born
in
it
;
among
the
multitude
of
Coketown
,
generically
called
"
the
Hands
,
"
---
a
race
who
would
have
found
more
favour
with
some
people
,
if
Providence
had
seen
fit
to
make
them
only
hands
,
or
,
like
the
lower
creatures
of
the
seashore
,
only
hands
and
stomachs
---
lived
a
certain
Stephen
Blackpool
,
forty
years
of
age
.
   
<EOS>
Stephen
looked
older
,
but
he
had
had
a
hard
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
said
that
every
life
has
its
roses
and
thorns
;
there
seemed
,
however
,
to
have
been
a
misadventure
or
mistake
in
Stephen
's
case
,
whereby
somebody
else
had
become
possessed
of
his
roses
,
and
he
had
become
possessed
of
the
same
somebody
else
's
thorns
in
addition
to
his
own
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
known
,
to
use
his
words
,
a
peck
of
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
usually
called
Old
Stephen
,
in
a
kind
of
rough
homage
to
the
fact
.
   
<EOS>
A
rather
stooping
man
,
with
a
knitted
brow
,
a
pondering
expression
of
face
,
and
a
hard
-
looking
head
sufficiently
capacious
,
on
which
his
iron
-
grey
hair
lay
long
and
thin
,
Old
Stephen
might
have
passed
for
a
particularly
intelligent
man
in
his
condition
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
he
was
not
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
no
place
among
those
remarkable
"
Hands
,
"
who
,
piecing
together
their
broken
intervals
of
leisure
through
many
years
,
had
mastered
difficult
sciences
,
and
acquired
a
knowledge
of
most
unlikely
things
.
 
<EOS>
He
held
no
station
among
the
Hands
who
could
make
speeches
and
carry
on
debates
.
 
<EOS>
Thousands
of
his
compeers
could
talk
much
better
than
he
,
at
any
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
good
power
-
loom
weaver
,
and
a
man
of
perfect
integrity
.
 
<EOS>
What
more
he
was
,
or
what
else
he
had
in
him
,
if
anything
,
let
him
show
for
himself
.
   
<EOS>
The
lights
in
the
great
factories
,
which
looked
,
when
they
were
illuminated
,
like
Fairy
palaces
---
or
the
travellers
by
express
-
train
said
so
---
were
all
extinguished
;
and
the
bells
had
rung
for
knocking
off
for
the
night
,
and
had
ceased
again
;
and
the
Hands
,
men
and
women
,
boy
and
girl
,
were
clattering
home
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Stephen
was
standing
in
the
street
,
with
the
old
sensation
upon
him
which
the
stoppage
of
the
machinery
always
produced
---
the
sensation
of
its
having
worked
and
stopped
in
his
own
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yet
I
do
n't
see
Rachael
,
still
!
"
said
he
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
wet
night
,
and
many
groups
of
young
women
passed
him
,
with
their
shawls
drawn
over
their
bare
heads
and
held
close
under
their
chins
to
keep
the
rain
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
Rachael
well
,
for
a
glance
at
any
one
of
these
groups
was
sufficient
to
show
him
that
she
was
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
there
were
no
more
to
come
;
and
then
he
turned
away
,
saying
in
a
tone
of
disappointment
,
"
Why
,
then
,
ha
'
missed
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
But
,
he
had
not
gone
the
length
of
three
streets
,
when
he
saw
another
of
the
shawled
figures
in
advance
of
him
,
at
which
he
looked
so
keenly
that
perhaps
its
mere
shadow
indistinctly
reflected
on
the
wet
pavement
---
<EOS>
if
he
could
have
seen
it
without
the
figure
itself
moving
along
from
lamp
to
lamp
,
brightening
and
fading
as
it
went
---
would
have
been
enough
to
tell
him
who
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
Making
his
pace
at
once
much
quicker
and
much
softer
,
he
darted
on
until
he
was
very
near
this
figure
,
then
fell
into
his
former
walk
,
and
called
"
Rachael
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
turned
,
being
then
in
the
brightness
of
a
lamp
;
and
raising
her
hood
a
little
,
showed
a
quiet
oval
face
,
dark
and
rather
delicate
,
irradiated
by
a
pair
of
very
gentle
eyes
,
and
further
set
off
by
the
perfect
order
of
her
shining
black
hair
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
face
in
its
first
bloom
;
she
was
a
woman
five
and
thirty
years
of
age
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
lad
!
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
thou
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
When
she
had
said
this
,
with
a
smile
which
would
have
been
quite
expressed
,
though
nothing
of
her
had
been
seen
but
<EOS>
her
pleasant
eyes
,
she
replaced
her
hood
again
,
and
they
went
on
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
thou
wast
ahind
me
,
Rachael
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Early
t'night
,
lass
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
'
Times
I
'm
a
little
early
,
Stephen
!
'
<EOS>
times
a
little
late
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
never
to
be
counted
on
,
going
home
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nor
going
t'other
way
,
neither
,
'
t
seems
to
me
,
Rachael
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Stephen
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
with
some
disappointment
in
his
face
,
but
with
a
respectful
and
patient
conviction
that
she
must
be
right
in
whatever
she
did
.
 
<EOS>
The
expression
was
not
lost
upon
her
;
she
laid
her
hand
lightly
on
his
arm
a
moment
as
if
to
thank
him
for
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
such
true
friends
,
lad
,
and
such
old
friends
,
and
getting
to
be
such
old
folk
,
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Rachael
,
thou'rt
as
young
as
ever
thou
wast
.
"
   
"
One
of
us
would
be
puzzled
how
to
get
old
,
Stephen
,
without
'
t
other
getting
so
too
,
both
being
alive
,
"
she
answered
,
laughing
;
"
but
,
anyways
,
we
're
such
old
friends
,
and
t
'
hide
a
word
of
honest
truth
fro
'
one
<EOS>
another
would
be
a
sin
and
a
pity
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
better
not
to
walk
too
much
together
.
 
<EOS>
"
Times
,
yes
!
 
<EOS>
'
Twould
be
hard
,
indeed
,
if
'
twas

"
she
said
,
with
a
cheerfulness
she
sought
to
communicate
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
hard
,
anyways
,
Rachael
.
"
   
"
Try
to
think
not
;
and
"
twill
seem
better
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
tried
a
long
time
,
and
'
ta'nt
got
better
.
 
<EOS>
But
thou'rt
right
;
'
t
might
mak
fok
talk
,
even
of
thee
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
hast
been
that
to
me
,
Rachael
,
through
so
many
year
:
 
<EOS>
thou
hast
done
me
so
much
good
,
and
heartened
of
me
in
that
cheering
way
,
that
thy
word
is
a
law
to
me
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
lass
,
and
a
bright
good
law
!
 
<EOS>
Better
than
some
real
ones
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
fret
about
them
,
Stephen
,
"
she
answered
quickly
,
and
not
without
an
anxious
glance
at
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
the
laws
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
said
,
with
a
slow
nod
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
'em
be
.
 
<EOS>
Let
everything
be
.
 
<EOS>
Let
all
sorts
alone
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
muddle
,
and
that
's
aw
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Always
a
muddle
?
"
said
Rachael
,
with
another
gentle
touch
upon
his
arm
,
as
if
to
recall
him
out
of
the
thoughtfulness
,
in
which
he
was
biting
the
long
ends
of
his
loose
neckerchief
as
he
walked
along
.
<EOS>
The
touch
had
its
instantaneous
effect
.
 
<EOS>
He
let
them
fall
,
turned
a
smiling
face
upon
her
,
and
said
,
as
he
broke
into
a
good
-
humoured
laugh
,
"
Ay
,
Rachael
,
lass
,
awlus
a
muddle
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
where
I
stick
.
<EOS>
I
come
to
the
muddle
many
times
and
agen
,
and
I
never
get
beyond
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
They
had
walked
some
distance
,
and
were
near
their
own
homes
.
 
<EOS>
The
woman
's
was
the
first
reached
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
one
of
the
many
small
streets
for
which
the
favourite
undertaker
(
who
turned
a
handsome
sum
out
of
the
one
poor
ghastly
pomp
of
the
neighbourhood
)
kept
a
black
ladder
,
in
order
that
those
who
had
done
their
daily
groping
up
and
down
the
narrow
stairs
might
slide
out
of
this
working
world
by
the
windows
.
 
<EOS>
She
stopped
at
the
corner
,
and
putting
her
hand
in
his
,
wished
him
good
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
night
,
dear
lass
;
good
night
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
went
,
with
her
neat
figure
and
her
sober
womanly
step
,
down
the
dark
street
,
and
he
stood
looking
after
her
until
she
turned
into
one
of
the
small
houses
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
flutter
of
her
coarse
shawl
,
perhaps
,
but
had
its
interest
in
this
man
's
eyes
;
not
a
tone
of
her
voice
but
had
its
echo
in
his
innermost
heart
.
   
<EOS>
When
she
was
lost
to
his
view
,
he
pursued
his
homeward
way
,
glancing
up
sometimes
at
the
sky
,
where
the
clouds
were
sailing
fast
and
wildly
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
they
were
broken
now
,
and
the
rain
had
ceased
,
and
the
moon
shone
,
---
looking
down
the
high
chimneys
of
Coketown
on
the
deep
furnaces
below
,
and
casting
Titanic
shadows
of
the
steam
-
engines
at
rest
,
upon
the
walls
where
they
were
lodged
.
<EOS>
The
man
seemed
to
have
brightened
with
the
night
,
as
he
went
on
.
   
<EOS>
His
home
,
in
such
another
street
as
the
first
,
saving
that
it
was
narrower
,
was
over
a
little
shop
.
 
<EOS>
How
it
came
to
pass
that
any
people
found
it
worth
their
while
to
sell
or
buy
the
wretched
little
toys
,
mixed
up
in
its
window
with
cheap
newspapers
and
pork
<EOS>
(
there
was
a
leg
to
be
raffled
for
to
-
morrow
-
night
)
,
matters
not
here
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
his
end
of
candle
from
a
shelf
,
lighted
it
at
another
end
of
candle
on
the
counter
,
without
disturbing
the
mistress
of
the
shop
who
was
asleep
in
her
little
room
,
and
went
upstairs
into
his
lodging
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
room
,
not
unacquainted
with
the
black
ladder
under
various
tenants
;
but
as
neat
,
at
present
,
as
such
a
room
could
be
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
books
and
writings
were
on
an
old
bureau
in
a
corner
,
the
furniture
was
decent
and
sufficient
,
and
,
though
the
atmosphere
was
tainted
,
the
room
was
clean
.
   
<EOS>
Going
to
the
hearth
to
set
the
candle
down
upon
a
round
three
-
legged
table
standing
there
,
he
stumbled
against
something
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
recoiled
,
looking
down
at
it
,
it
raised
itself
up
into
the
form
of
a
woman
in
a
sitting
attitude
.
   
<EOS>
"
Heaven
's
mercy
,
woman
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
falling
farther
off
from
the
figure
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hast
thou
come
back
again
!
"
   
<EOS>
Such
a
woman
!
 
<EOS>
A
disabled
,
drunken
creature
,
barely
able
to
preserve
her
sitting
posture
by
steadying
herself
with
one
begrimed
hand
on
the
floor
,
while
the
other
was
so
purposeless
in
trying
to
push
away
her
tangled
hair
from
her
face
,
that
it
only
blinded
her
the
more
with
the
dirt
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
creature
so
foul
to
look
at
,
in
her
tatters
,
stains
and
splashes
,
but
so
much
fouler
than
that
in
her
moral
infamy
,
that
it
was
a
shameful
thing
even
to
see
her
.
   
<EOS>
After
an
impatient
oath
or
two
,
and
some
stupid
clawing
of
herself
with
the
hand
not
necessary
to
her
support
,
she
got
her
hair
away
from
her
eyes
sufficiently
to
obtain
a
sight
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
sat
swaying
her
body
to
and
fro
,
and
making
gestures
with
her
unnerved
arm
,
which
seemed
intended
as
the
accompaniment
to
a
fit
of
laughter
,
though
her
face
was
stolid
and
drowsy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Eigh
,
lad
?
 
<EOS>
What
,
yo'r
there
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Some
hoarse
sounds
meant
for
this
,
came
mockingly
out
of
her
at
last
;
and
her
head
dropped
forward
on
her
breast
.
   
<EOS>
"
Back
agen
?
<EOS>
"
she
screeched
,
after
some
minutes
,
as
if
he
had
that
moment
said
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
 
<EOS>
And
back
agen
.
 
<EOS>
Back
agen
ever
and
ever
so
often
.
 
<EOS>
Back
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
back
.
 
<EOS>
Why
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
Roused
by
the
unmeaning
violence
with
which
she
cried
it
out
,
she
scrambled
up
,
and
stood
supporting
herself
with
her
shoulders
against
the
wall
;
dangling
in
one
hand
by
the
string
,
a
dunghill
-
fragment
of
a
bonnet
,
and
trying
to
look
scornfully
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
sell
thee
off
again
,
and
I
'll
sell
thee
off
again
,
and
I
'll
sell
thee
off
a
score
of
times
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
with
something
between
a
furious
menace
and
an
effort
at
a
defiant
dance
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
awa
'
from
th
'
bed
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
was
sitting
on
the
side
of
it
,
with
his
face
hidden
in
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
awa

<EOS>
from
'
t.
 
'
Tis
mine
,
and
I
've
a
right
to

!
"
   
<EOS>
As
she
staggered
to
it
,
he
avoided
her
with
a
shudder
,
and
passed
<EOS>
---
his
face
still
hidden
---
to
the
opposite
end
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
She
threw
herself
upon
the
bed
heavily
,
and
soon
was
snoring
hard
.
 
<EOS>
He
sunk
into
a
chair
,
and
moved
but
once
all
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
to
throw
a
covering
over
her
;
as
if
his
hands
were
not
enough
to
hide
her
,
even
in
the
darkness
.

The
Fairy
palaces
burst
into
illumination
,
before
pale
morning
showed
the
monstrous
serpents
of
smoke
trailing
themselves
over
Coketown
.
 
<EOS>
A
clattering
of
clogs
upon
the
pavement
;
a
rapid
ringing
of
bells
;
and
all
the
melancholy
mad
elephants
,
polished
and
oiled
up
for
the

monotony

were
at
their
heavy
exercise
again

<EOS>
Stephen
bent
over
his
loom
,
quiet
,
watchful
,
and
steady
.
 
<EOS>
A
special
contrast
,
as
every
man
was
in
the
forest
of
looms
where
Stephen
worked
,
to
the
crashing
,
smashing
,
tearing
piece
of
mechanism
at
which
he
laboured
.
 
<EOS>
Never
fear
,
good
people
of
an
anxious
turn
of
mind
,
that
Art
will
consign
Nature
to
oblivion
.
 
<EOS>
Set
anywhere
<EOS>
,
side
by
side
,
the
work
of
GOD
and
the
work
of
man
;
and
the
former
,
even
though
it
be
a
troop
of
Hands
of
very
small
account
,
will
gain
in
dignity
from
the
comparison
.
   
<EOS>
So
many
hundred

in
this
Mill

so

<EOS>
It
is
known
,
to
the
force
of
a
single
pound
weight
,
what
the
engine
will
do
;
but
,
not
all
the

of
the
National
Debt
can
tell
me
the
capacity
for
good
or
evil
,
for
love

hatred
,
for
patriotism
or
discontent
,
for
the
decomposition
of
virtue
into
vice

or
the

,
at
any
single
moment
in
the
soul
of
one
of
these
its
quiet
servants
,
with
the
composed
faces
and
the
regulated
actions
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
mystery
in
it
;
there
is
an
unfathomable
mystery
in
the
meanest
of
them
,
for
ever
.
<EOS>

Supposing
we
were
to
reverse
our
arithmetic
for
material
objects

and
to
govern
these
awful

by
other

<EOS>
The
day
grew
strong
,
and
showed
itself
outside
,
even
against
the
flaming
lights
within
.
 
<EOS>
The
lights
were
turned
out
,
and
the
work
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
The
rain
fell
,
and
the
Smoke
-
serpents
,
submissive
to
the
curse
of
all
that
tribe
,
trailed
themselves
upon
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
waste
-
yard
outside
,
the
steam
from
the
escape
pipe
,
the
litter
of
barrels
and
old
iron
,
the
shining
heaps
of
coals
,
the
ashes
everywhere
,
were
shrouded
in
a
veil
of
mist

<EOS>
The
work
went
on
,
until
the
noon

bell
rang

<EOS>
More
clattering
upon
the

<EOS>
The

Hands

Stephen
came
out
of
the
hot
mill
into
the
damp
wind
and
cold
wet
streets
,
haggard
and
worn
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
from
his
own
class
and
his
own
quarter
,
taking
nothing
but
a
little
bread
as
he
walked
along
,
towards
the
hill
on
which
his
principal
employer
lived
,
in
a
red
house
with
black
outside
shutters
,
green
inside

,
a
black
street

,
up
two
white

,
BOUNDERBY

in

very
like

upon
a
brazen

and
a
round
brazen

handle
underneath
it
,
like
a

<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
was
at
his
lunch
.
 
<EOS>
So
Stephen
had
expected
.
 
<EOS>
Would
his

say
that
one
of
the
Hands
begged
leave
to
speak
to
him

<EOS>
Message

There
was

yes

<EOS>
Stephen
Blackpool
in

<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
(
whom
he
just
knew
by
sight
)
,
at
lunch
on
chop
and
sherry
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
netting
at
the
fireside
,
in
a
side
-
saddle
attitude
,
with
one
foot
in
a
cotton
stirrup
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
part
,
at
once
of
Mrs
Sparsit
's
dignity
and
service
,
not
to
lunch
.
 
<EOS>
She
supervised
the
meal
officially
,
but
implied
that
in
her
own
stately
person
she
considered
lunch
a
weakness
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Stephen
,
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
,
"
<EOS>
what
's
the
matter
with
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Stephen
made
a
bow
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
servile
one
---
these
Hands
will
never
do
that
!
 
<EOS>
Lord
bless
you
,
sir
,
you
'll
never
catch
them
at
that
,
if
they
have
been
with
you
twenty
years
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
,
as
a
complimentary
toilet
for
Mrs
Sparsit
,
tucked
his
neckerchief
ends
into
his
waistcoat
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
,
taking
some
sherry
,
"
we
have
never
had
any
difficulty
with
you
,
and
you
have
never
been
one
of
the
unreasonable
ones
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
n't
expect
to
be
set
up
in
a
coach
and
six
,
and
to
be
fed
on
turtle
soup
and
venison
,
with
a
gold
spoon
,
as
a
good
many
of
'em
do
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
always
represented
this
to
be
the
sole
,
immediate
,
and
direct
object
of
any
Hand
who
was
not
entirely
satisfied
;
"
and
therefore
I
know
already
that
you
have
not
come
here
to
make
a
complaint
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
you
know
,
I
am
certain
of
that
,
beforehand
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No

,
sure
I
ha
'
not
coom
for

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
seemed
agreeably
surprised
,
notwithstanding
his
previous
strong
conviction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
he
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
steady
Hand
,
and
I
was
not
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
let
me
hear
what
it
's
all
about
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
's
not
that

let
me
hear
what
it
is

<EOS>
What
have
you
got
to
say
?
 
<EOS>
Out

lad

"
   
<EOS>
Stephen
happened
to
glance
towards
Mrs
Sparsit
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
go
,
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
,
if
you
wish
it
,
"
said
that
self
-
sacrificing
lady
,
making
a
feint
of
taking
her
foot
out
of
the
stirrup
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
stayed
her
,
by
holding
a
mouthful
of
chop
in
suspension
before
swallowing
it
,
and
putting
out
his
left
hand
.
<EOS>
Then
,
withdrawing
his
hand
and
swallowing
his
mouthful
of
chop
,
he
said
to
Stephen
:
   
<EOS>
"
Now
you
know
,
this
good
lady
is
a
born
lady

a
high
lady

<EOS>
You
are
not

suppose
because
she
keeps
my

that
she

n't
been
very
high
up

ah

up

<EOS>
Now
,
if

this

If

can
be

this

will
stay

<EOS>
"
Sir

was
the
reply
,
accompanied
with
a
slight
flush
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very

said
Mr
Bounderby
,
pushing
away
his
plate
,
and
leaning
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fire

<EOS>

I

Stephen
began
,
raising
his
eyes
from
the
floor
,
after
a
moment
's
consideration
,
"
to
ask
yo

<EOS>
"
I

said
Mr

<EOS>
"
She

sold

"
I

<EOS>
(

said
Mr

,
in

glass

<EOS>
Every
line
in
his
face
deepened
as
he
said
it
,
and
put
in
its
affecting
evidence
of
the
suffering
he
had
undergone

From

Mrs

,
easily
ambling
along
with

raised
the
Coriolanian

shook
her
head
,
as
much

"
   
<EOS>
In
the
strength
of
his
misfortune
,
and
the
energy
of
his
distress
,
he
fired
for
the
moment
like
a
proud
man
.
 
<EOS>
In
another
moment
,
he
stood
as
he
had
stood
all
the
time
---
his
usual
stoop
upon
him
;
<EOS>
his
pondering
face
addressed
to
Mr
Bounderby
,
with
a
curious
expression
on
it
,
half
shrewd
,
half
perplexed
,
as
if
his
mind
were
set
upon
unravelling
something
very
difficult
;
his
hat
held
tight
in
his
left
hand
,
which
rested
on
his
hip
;
his
right
arm
,
with
a
rugged
propriety
and
force
of
action
,
very
earnestly
emphasizing
what
he
said
:
 
not
least
so
when
it
always
paused
,
a
little
bent
,
but
not
withdrawn
,
as
he
paused
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
acquainted
with
all
this
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
,
"
except
the
last
clause
,
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
bad
job
;
that
's
what
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
better
have
been
satisfied
as
you
were
,
and
not

got
married

<EOS>
However
,
it
's
too
late
to

that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Was
it
an
unequal
marriage
,
sir
,
in
point
of
years

asked
Mrs
Sparsit
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
hear
what
this
lady
asks
.
 
<EOS>
Was
it
an
unequal

this
unlucky

yours

said
Mr

<EOS>
"
Not

<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
sir
?
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
to
her
Chief
,
with
great
placidity
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
inferred
,
from
its
being
so
miserable
a
marriage
,
that
it
was
probably
an
unequal
one
in
point
of
years
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
looked
very
hard
at
the
good
lady
in
a
side
-
long
way
that
had
an
odd
sheepishness
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
fortified
himself
with
a
little
more
sherry
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
?
 
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
go
on
?
"
<EOS>
he
then
asked
,
turning
rather
irritably
on
Stephen
Blackpool
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ha
'
coom
to
ask
yo
,
sir
,
how
I
am
to

this
woman

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Stephen
infused
a
yet
deeper
gravity
into
the
mixed
expression
of
his
attentive
face
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
uttered
a
gentle
ejaculation
,
as
having
received
a
moral
shock
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
said
Bounderby
,
getting
up
to
lean
his
back
against
the
chimney
-
piece
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
talking
about

<EOS>
You

He

speaks
<EOS>

I
fear

sir

"
observed
Mrs
Sparsit
in
an
undertone
,
and
much
dejected
by
the
immorality
of
the
people
.
   
<EOS>
"
I

The

When

<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
tell

what
!
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
,
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
such
a
law
.
"
   
<EOS>
Stephen
,
subsiding
into
his
quiet
manner
,
and
never
wandering
in
his
attention
,
gave
a
nod
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
not
for
you
at
all

<EOS>
It
costs
money

<EOS>
It
costs
a
mint
of
money

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
much
might
that
be
?
"
<EOS>
Stephen
calmly
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
'd
have
to
go
to
Doctors
'
Commons
with
a
suit
,
and
you
'd
have
to
go
to
a
court
of
Common
Law
with
a
suit
,
and
you
'd
have
to
go
to
the
House
of
Lords
with
a
suit
,
and
you
'd
have
to
get
an
Act
of
Parliament
to
enable
you
to
marry
again
,
and
it
would
cost
you
(
if
it
was
a
case
of
very
plain
sailing
)
,
I
suppose
from
a
thousand
to
fifteen
hundred
pound
,
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
twice
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
other
law
?
"
   
"
Certainly
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
then
,
sir
,
"
said
Stephen
,
<EOS>
turning
white
,
and
motioning
with
that
right
hand
of
his
,
as
if
he
gave
everything
to
the
four
winds
,
"
'
tis
a
muddle

<EOS>
'
Tis

the

the

"
   
<EOS>
(
Mrs
Sparsit
again
dejected
by
the
impiety
of
the
people
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
Pooh
,
pooh
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
talk
nonsense
,
my
good
fellow
,
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
,
"
about
things
you
do
n't
understand
;
and
do
n't
you
call
the
Institutions
of
your
country
a
muddle
,
or
you
'll
get
yourself
into
a
real
muddle
one
of
these
fine
mornings
.
 
<EOS>
The
institutions
of
your
country
are
not
your
piece
-
work
,
and
the
only
thing
you
have
got
to
do
,
is
,
to
mind
your
piece
-
work
.
 
<EOS>
You
did
n't
take
your
wife
for
fast
and
for
loose
;
but
for
better
for
worse
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
has
turned
out
worse
---
why
,
all
we
have
got
to
say
is
,
she
might
have
turned
out
better
.
"
   
"
'
Tis
a
muddle
,
"
said
Stephen
,
shaking
his
head
as
he
moved
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
a
'
a
muddle
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
!
"
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
resumed
,
as
a
valedictory
address
.
 
<EOS>
"
With
what
I
shall
call
your
unhallowed
opinions
,
you
have
been
quite
shocking
this
lady
:
 
who
,
as
I
have
already
told
you
,
is
a
born
lady
,
and
who
,
as
I
have
not
already
told
you
,
has
had
her
own
marriage
misfortunes
to
the
tune
of
tens
of
thousands
of
pounds
---
tens
of
Thousands
of
Pounds
!
"
(
he
repeated
it
with
great
relish
)
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
you
have
always
been
a
steady
Hand
hitherto
;
but
my
opinion
is
,
and
so
I
tell
you
plainly
,
that
you
are
turning
into
the
wrong
road
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
been
listening
to
some
mischievous
stranger
or
other
---
they
're
always
about
---
and
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
,
to
come
out
of
that
.
 
<EOS>
Now
you
know
;
"
here
his
countenance
expressed
marvellous
acuteness
;
"
I
can
see
as
far
into
a
grindstone
as
another
man
;
farther
than
a
good
many
,
perhaps
,
because
I
had
my
nose
<EOS>
well
kept
to
it
when
I
was
young
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
traces
of
the
turtle
soup
,
and
venison
,
and
gold
spoon
in
this
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
do
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Bounderby
,
shaking
his
head
with
obstinate
cunning
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
the
Lord
Harry
,
I
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
a
very
different
shake
of
the
head
and
deep
sigh
,
Stephen
said
,
"
Thank
you
,
sir
<EOS>
,
I
wish
you
good
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
he
left
Mr
Bounderby
swelling
at
his
own
portrait
on
the
wall
,
as
if
he
were
going
to
explode
himself
into
it
;
and
Mrs
Sparsit
still
ambling
on
with
her
foot
in
her
stirrup
,
looking
quite
cast
down
by
the
popular
vices
.

Chapter
12
.
<EOS>
The
Old
Woman
 
Old
Stephen
descended
the
two
white
steps
,
shutting
the
black
door
with
the
brazen
door
-
plate
,
by
the
aid
of
the
brazen
full
-
stop
,
to
which
he
gave
a
parting
polish
with
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
,
observing
that
his
hot
hand
clouded
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
crossed
the
street
with
his
eyes
bent
upon
the
ground
,
and
thus
was
walking
sorrowfully
away
,
when
he
felt
a
touch
upon
his
arm
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
touch
he
needed
most
at
such
a
moment
---
the
touch
that
could
calm
the
wild
waters
of
his
soul
,
as
the
uplifted
hand
of
the
sublimest
love
and
patience
could
abate
the
raging
of
the
sea
---
yet
it
was
a
woman
's
hand
too
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
old
woman
,
tall
and
shapely
still
,
though
withered
by
time
,
on
whom
his
eyes
fell
when
he
stopped
and
turned
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
very
cleanly
and
plainly
dressed
,
had
country
mud
upon
her
shoes
,
and
was
newly
come
from
a
journey
.
<EOS>
The
flutter
of
her
manner
,
in
the
unwonted
noise
of
the
streets
;
the
spare
shawl
,
carried
unfolded
on
her
arm
;
the
heavy
umbrella
,
and
little
basket
;
the
loose
long
-
fingered
gloves
,
to
which
her
hands
were
unused
;
all
bespoke
an
old
woman
from
the
country
,
in
her
plain
holiday
clothes
,
come
into
Coketown
on
an
expedition
of
rare
occurrence
.
 
<EOS>
Remarking
this
at
a
glance
,
with
the
quick
observation
of
his
class
,
Stephen
Blackpool
bent
his
attentive
face
---
his
face
,
which
,
like
the
faces
of
many
of
his
order
,
by
dint
of
long
working
with
eyes
and
hands
in
the
midst
of
a
prodigious
noise
,
had
acquired
the
concentrated
look
with
which
we
are
familiar
in
the
countenances
of
the
deaf
---
the
better
to
hear
what
she
asked
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
sir
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
"
did
n't
I
see
you
come
out
of
that
gentleman
's
house
?
<EOS>
"
pointing
back
to
Mr
Bounderby
's
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
it
was
you
,
unless
I
have
had
the
bad
luck
to
mistake
the
person
in
following
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
missus
,
"
returned
Stephen
,
"
it
were
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
---
you
'll
excuse
an
old
woman
's
curiosity
---
have
you
seen
the
gentleman
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
missus
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
how
did
he
look
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
Was
he
portly
,
bold
,
outspoken
,
and
hearty
?
"
 
<EOS>
As
she
straightened
her
own
figure
,
and
held
up
her
head
in
adapting
her
action
to
her
words
,
the
idea
crossed
Stephen
that
he
had
seen
this
old
woman
before
,
and
had
not
quite
liked
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
O
yes
,
"
he
returned
,
observing
her
more
attentively
,
"
he
were
all
that
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
And
healthy
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
"
as
the
fresh
wind
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
returned
Stephen
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
were
ett'n
and
drinking
---
as
large
and
as
loud
as
a
Hummobee
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
old
woman
,
with
infinite
content
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
certainly
never
had
seen
this
old
woman
before
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
there
was
a
vague
remembrance
in
his
mind
,
as
if
he
had
more
than
once
dreamed
of
some
old
woman
like
her
.
   
<EOS>
She
walked
along
at
his
side
,
and
,
gently
accommodating
himself
to
her
humour
,
he
said
Coketown
was
a
busy
place
,
was
it
not
?
 
<EOS>
To
which
she
answered
"
Eigh
sure
!
 
<EOS>
Dreadful
busy
!
"
 
<EOS>
Then
he
said
,
she
came
from
the
country
,
he
saw
?
 
<EOS>
To
which
she
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
   
<EOS>
"
By
Parliamentary
,
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
forty
mile
by
Parliamentary
this
morning
,
and
I
'm
going
back
the
same
forty
mile
this
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
I
walked
nine
mile
to
the
station
this
morning
,
and
if
I
find
nobody
on
the
road
to
give
me
a
lift
,
I
shall
walk
the
nine
mile
back
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
pretty
well
,
sir
,
at
my
age
!
"
said
the
chatty
old
woman
,
her
eye
brightening
with
exultation
.
   
<EOS>
"
'
Deed
'
tis
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
do't
too
often
,
missus
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
Once
a
year
,
"
she
answered
,
shaking
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
spend
my
savings
so
,
once
every
year
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
regular
,
to
tramp
about
the
streets
,
and
see
the
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
to
see
'
em
?
"
returned
Stephen
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
enough
for
me
,
"
she
replied
,
with
great
earnestness
and
interest
of
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ask
no
more
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
standing
about
,
on
this
side
of
the
way
,
to
see
that
gentleman
,
"
turning
her
head
back
towards
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
's
again
,
"
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
he
's
late
this
year
,
and
I
have
not
seen
him
.
 
<EOS>
You
came
out
instead
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
if
I
am
obliged
to
go
back
without
a
glimpse
of
him
---
I
only
want
a
glimpse
---
well
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
you
,
and
you
have
seen
him
,
and
I
must
make
that
do
.
"
 
<EOS>
Saying
this
,
she
looked
at
Stephen
as
if
to
fix
his
features
in
her
mind
,
and
her
eye
was
not
so
bright
as
it
had
been
.
   
<EOS>
With
a
large
allowance
for
difference
of
tastes
,
and
with
all
submission
to
the
patricians
of
Coketown
,
this
seemed
so
extraordinary
a
source
of
interest
to
take
so
much
trouble
about
,
that
it
perplexed
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
were
passing
the
church
now
,
and
as
his
eye
caught
the
clock
,
he
quickened
his
pace
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
going
to
his
work
?
<EOS>
the
old
woman
said
,
quickening
hers
,
too
,
quite
easily
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
time
was
nearly
out
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
telling
her
where
he
worked
,
the
old
woman
became
a
more
singular
old
woman
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
An't
you
happy
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
---
there
's
awmost
nobbody
but
has
their
troubles
,
missus
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
answered
evasively
,
because
the
old
woman
appeared
to
take
it
for
granted
that
he
would
be
very
happy
indeed
,
and
he
had
not
the
heart
to
disappoint
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
that
there
was
trouble
enough
in
the
world
;
and
if
the
old
woman
had
lived
so
long
,
and
could
count
upon
his
having
so
little
,
why
so
much
the
better
for
her
,
and
none
the
worse
for
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ay
,
ay
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
your
troubles
at
home
,
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
   
<EOS>
"
Times
.
 
<EOS>
Just
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
"
he
answered
,
slightly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
working
under
such
a
gentleman
,
they
do
n't
follow
you
to
the
Factory
?
"
   
<EOS>
No
,
no
;
they
did
n't
follow
him
there
,
said
Stephen
.
 
<EOS>
All
correct
there
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
accordant
there
.
 
<EOS>
(
He
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
,
for
her
pleasure
<EOS>
,
that
there
was
a
sort
of
Divine
<EOS>
Right
there
;
but
,
I
have
heard
claims
almost
as
magnificent
of
late
years
.
)
   
<EOS>
They
were
now
in
the
black
by
-
road
near
the
place
,
and
the
Hands
were
crowding
in
.
 
<EOS>
The
bell
was
ringing
,
and
the
Serpent
was
a
Serpent
of
many
coils
,
and
the
Elephant
was
getting
ready
.
 
<EOS>
The
strange
old
woman
was
delighted
with
the
very
bell
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
beautifullest
bell
she
had
ever
heard
,
she
said
,
and
sounded
grand
!
   
<EOS>
She
asked
him
,
when
he
stopped
good
-
naturedly
to
shake
hands
with
her
before
going
in
,
how
long
he
had
worked
there
?
   
<EOS>
"
A
dozen
year
,
"
he
told
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
kiss
the
hand
,
"
said
she
,
"
that
has
worked
in
this
fine
factory
for
a
dozen
year
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
lifted
it
,
though
he
would
have
prevented
her
,
and
put
it
to
her
lips
.
 
<EOS>
What
harmony
,
besides
her
age
and
her
simplicity
,
surrounded
her
,
he
did
not
know
,
but
even
in
this
fantastic
action
there
was
a
something
neither
out
of
time
nor
place
:
 
a
something
which
it
seemed
as
if
nobody
else
could
have
made
as
serious
,
or
done
with
such
a
natural
and
touching
air
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
been
at
his
loom
full
half
an
hour
,
thinking
about
this
old
woman
<EOS>
,
when
,
having
occasion
to
move
round
the
loom
for
its
adjustment
,
he
glanced
through
a
window
which
was
in
his
corner
,
and
saw
her
still
looking
up
at
the
pile
of
building
,
lost
in
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
Heedless
of
the
smoke
and
mud
and
wet
,
and
of
her
two
long
journeys
,
she
was
gazing
at
it
,
as
if
the
heavy
thrum
that
issued
from
its
many
stories
were
proud
music
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
gone
by
and
by
,
and
the
day
went
after
her
,
and
the
lights
sprung
up
again
,
and
the
Express
whirled
in
full
sight
of
the
Fairy
Palace
over
the
arches
near
:
 
<EOS>
little
felt
amid
the
jarring
of
the
machinery
,
and
scarcely
heard
above
its
crash
and
rattle
.
 
<EOS>
Long
before
then
his
thoughts
had
gone
back
to
the
dreary
room
above
the
little
shop
,
and
to
the
shameful
figure
heavy
on
the
bed
,
but
heavier
on
his
heart
.
   
<EOS>
Machinery
slackened
;
throbbing
feebly
like
a
fainting
pulse
;
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
The
bell
again
;
the
glare
of
light
and
heat
dispelled
;
the
factories
,
looming
heavy
in
the
black
wet
night
---
their
tall
chimneys
rising
up
into
the
air
like
competing
Towers
of
Babel
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
spoken
to
Rachael
only
last
night
,
it
was
true
,
and
had
walked
with
her
a
little
way
;
but
he
had
his
new
misfortune
on
him
,
in
which
no
one
else
could
give
him
a
moment
's
relief
,
and
,
for
the
sake
of
it
,
and
because
he
knew
himself
to
want
that
softening
of
his
anger
which
no
voice
but
hers
could
effect
,
he
felt
he
might
so
far
disregard
what
she
had
said
as
to
wait
for
her
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
waited
,
but
she
had
eluded
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
On
no
other
night
in
the
year
could
he
so
ill
have
spared
her
patient
face
.
   
<EOS>
O
!
 
<EOS>
Better
to
have
no
home
in
which
to
lay
his
head
,
than
to
have
a
home
and
dread
to
go
to
it
,
through
such
a
cause
.
 
<EOS>
He
ate
and
drank
,
for
he
was
exhausted
---
but
he
little
knew
or
cared
what
;
and
he
wandered
about
in
the
chill
rain
,
thinking
and
thinking
,
and
brooding
and
brooding
.
   
<EOS>
No
word
of
a
new
marriage
had
ever
passed
between
them
;
but
Rachael
had
taken
great
pity
on
him
years
ago
,
and
to
her
alone
he
had
opened
his
closed
heart
all
this
time
,
on
the
subject
of
his
miseries
;
and
he
knew
very
well
that
if
he
were
free
to
ask
her
,
she
would
take
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
of
the
home
he
might
at
that
moment
have
been
seeking
with
pleasure
and
pride
;
of
the
different
man
he
might
have
been
that
night
;
of
the
lightness
then
in
his
now
heavy
-
laden
breast
;
of
the
then
restored
honour
,
self
-
respect
,
and
tranquillity
all
torn
to
pieces
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
of
the
waste
of
the
best
part
of
his
life
,
of
the
change
it
made
in
his
character
for
the
worse
every
day
,
of
the
dreadful
nature
of
his
existence
,
bound
hand
and
foot
,
to
a
dead
woman
,
and
tormented
by
a
demon
in
her
shape
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
of
Rachael
,
how
young
when
they
were
first
brought
together
in
these
circumstances
,
how
mature
now
,
how
soon
to
grow
old
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
of
the
number
of
girls
and
women
she
had
seen
<EOS>
marry
,
how
many
homes
with
children
in
them
she
had
seen
grow
up
around
her
<EOS>
,
how
she
had
contentedly
pursued
her
own
lone
quiet
path
---
for
him
---
and
how
he
had
sometimes
seen
a
shade
of
melancholy
on
her
blessed
face
,
that
smote
him
with
remorse
and
despair
.
 
<EOS>
He
set
the
picture
of
her
up
,
beside
the
infamous
image
of
last
night
;
and
thought
,
Could
it
be
,
that
the
whole
earthly
course
of
one
so
gentle
,
good
,
and
self
-
denying
,
was
subjugate
to
such
a
wretch
as
that
!
   
<EOS>
Filled
with
these
thoughts
---
so
filled
that
he
had
an
unwholesome
sense
of
growing
larger
,
of
being
placed
in
some
new
and
diseased
relation
towards
the
objects
among
which
he
passed
,
of
seeing
the
iris
round
<EOS>
every
misty
light
turn
red
---
he
went
home
for
shelter
.

Chapter

<EOS>
Rachael
 
<EOS>
A
candle
faintly
burned
in
the
window
,
to
which
the
black
ladder
had
often
been
raised
for
the
sliding
away
of
all
that
was
most
precious
in
this
world
to
a
striving
wife
and
a
brood
of
hungry
babies
;
and
Stephen
added
to
his
other
thoughts
the
stern
reflection
,
that
of
all
the
casualties
of
this
existence
upon
earth
,
not
one
was
dealt
out
with
so
unequal
a
hand
as
Death
.
 
<EOS>
The
inequality
of
Birth
was
nothing
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
say
that
the
child
of
a
King
and
the
child
of
a
Weaver
were
born
to
-
night
in
the
same
moment
,
what
was
that
disparity
,
to
the
death
of
any
human
creature
who
was
serviceable
to
,
or
beloved
by
,
another
,
while
this
abandoned
woman
lived
on
!
   
<EOS>
From
the
outside
of
his
home
he
gloomily
passed
to
the
inside
,
with
suspended
breath
and
with
a
slow
footstep
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
up
to
his
door
,
opened
it
,
and
so
into
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
Quiet
and
peace
were
there
.
 
<EOS>
Rachael
was
there
,
sitting
by
the
bed
.
   
<EOS>
She
turned
her
head
,
and
the
light
of
her
face
shone
in
upon
the
midnight
of
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
She
sat
by
the
bed
,
watching
and
tending
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
to
say
,
he
saw
that
some
one
lay
there
,
and
he
knew
too
well
<EOS>
it
must
be
she
;
but
Rachael
's
hands
had
put
a
curtain
up
,
so
that
she
was
screened
from
his
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Her
disgraceful
garments
were
removed
,
and
some
of
Rachael
's
were
in
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
was
in
its
place
and
order
as
he
had
always
kept
it
,
the
little
fire
was
newly
trimmed
,
and
the
hearth
was
freshly
swept
.
 
<EOS>
It
appeared
to
him
that
he
saw
all
this
in
Rachael
's
face
,
and
looked
at
nothing
besides
.
 
<EOS>
While
looking
at
it
,
it
was
shut
out
from
his
view
by
the
softened
tears
that
filled
his
eyes
;
but
not
before
he
had
seen
how
earnestly
she
looked
at
him
,
and
how
her
own
eyes
were
filled
too
.
   
<EOS>
She
turned
again
towards
the
bed
,
and
satisfying
herself
that
all
was
quiet
there
,
spoke
in
a
low
,
calm
,
cheerful
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you

come

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ha
'
been
walking
up
an
'
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
'
tis
too
bad
a
night
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
The
rain
falls
very
heavy
,
and
the
wind
has
risen
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
wind
?
 
<EOS>
True
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
blowing
hard
.
 
<EOS>
Hark
to
the
thundering
in
the
chimney
,
and
the
surging
noise
!
 
<EOS>
To
have
been
out
in
such
a
wind
,
and
not
to
have
known
it
was
blowing
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
here
once
before
,
to
-
day
,
Stephen
.
 
<EOS>
Landlady
came
round
for
me
at
dinner
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
some
one
here
that
needed
looking
to
,
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
And
"
deed
<EOS>
she
was
right
.
 
<EOS>
All
wandering
and
lost
,
Stephen
.
 
<EOS>
Wounded
too
,
and
bruised
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
slowly
moved
to
a
chair
and
sat
down
,
drooping
his
head
before
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
came
to
do
what
little
I
could
,
Stephen
;
first
,
for
that
she
worked
with
me
when
we
were
girls
both
,
and
for
that
you
courted
her
and
married
her
when
I
was
her
friend
---
"
   
He
laid
his
furrowed
forehead
on
his
hand
,
with
a
low
groan
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
next
,
for
that
I
know
your
heart
,
and
am
right
sure
and
certain
that
'
tis
far
too
merciful
to
let
her
die
,
or
even
so
much
as
suffer
,
for
want
of
aid
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
knowest
who
said
,
"
Let
him
who
is
without
sin
among
you
cast
the
first
stone
at
her
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
There
have
been
plenty
to
do
that
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
art
not
the
man
to
cast
the
last
stone
,
Stephen
,
when
she
is
brought
so
low
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
Rachael
,
Rachael
!
"
   
"
Thou
hast
been
a
cruel
sufferer
,
Heaven
reward
thee
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
in
compassionate
accents
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
thy
poor
friend
,
with
all
my
heart
and
mind
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
wounds
of
which
she
had
spoken
,
seemed
to
be
about
the
neck
of
the
self
-
made
outcast
.
 
<EOS>
She
dressed
them
now
,
still
without
showing
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
steeped
a
piece
of
linen
in
a
basin
,
into
which
she
poured
some
liquid
from
a
bottle
,
and
laid
it
with
a
gentle
hand
upon
the
sore
.
 
<EOS>
The
three
-
legged
table
had
been
drawn
close
to
the
bedside
,
and
on
it
there
were
two
bottles
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
one
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
so
far
off
,
but
that
Stephen
,
following
her
hands
with
his
eyes
,
could
read
what
was
printed
on
it
in
large
letters
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
of
a
deadly
hue
,
and
a
sudden
horror
seemed
to
fall
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
stay
here
,
Stephen
,
"
said
Rachael
,
quietly
resuming
her
seat
,
"
till
the
bells
go
Three
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
to
be
done
again
at
three
,
and
then
she
may
be
left
till
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
thy
rest
agen
to
-
morrow
's
work
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
slept
sound
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
wake
many
nights
,
when
I
am
put
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
thou
who
art
in
need
of
rest
---
so
white
and
tired
.
<EOS>
Try
to
sleep
in
the
chair
there
,
while
I
watch
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
hadst
no
sleep
last
night
<EOS>
,
I
can
well
believe
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
's
work
is
far
harder
for
thee
than
for
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
heard
the
thundering
and
surging
out
of
doors
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
his
late
angry
mood
were
going
about
trying
to
get
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
cast
it
out
;
she
would
keep
it
out
;
he
trusted
to
her
to
defend
him
from
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
She
do
n't
know
me
,
Stephen
;
she
just
drowsily
mutters
and
stares
.
<EOS>
I
have
spoken
to
her
times
and
again
,
but
she
do
n't
notice
!
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
<EOS>
as
well
so
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
comes
to
her
right
mind
once
more
,
I
shall
have
done
what
I
can
,
and
she
never
the
wiser
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
long
,
Rachael
,
is
'
t
looked
for
,
that
she
'll
be
so
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Doctor
said
she
would
haply
come
to
her
mind
to
-
morrow
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
eyes
fell
again
on
the
bottle
,
and
a
tremble
passed
over
him
,
causing
him
to
shiver
in
every
limb
.
 
<EOS>
She
thought
he
was
chilled
with
the
wet
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
said
,
"
it
was
not
that
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
had
a
fright
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
fright
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
!
coming
in
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
were
walking
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
were
thinking
.
<EOS>
When
I
---
"
 
<EOS>
It
seized
him
again
;
and
he
stood
up
,
holding
by
the
mantel
-
shelf
,
as
he
pressed
his
dank
cold
hair
down
with
a
hand
that
shook
as
if
it
were
palsied
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stephen
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
coming
to
him
,
but
he
stretched
out
his
arm
to
stop
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
,
please
;
do
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
see
thee
setten
by
the
bed
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
thee
,
a
'
so
good
,
and
so
forgiving
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
see
thee
as
I
see
thee
when
I
coom
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
never
see
thee
better
than
so
.
<EOS>
Never
,
never
,
never
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
a
violent
fit
of
trembling
,
and
then
sunk
into
his
chair
.
<EOS>
After
a
time
he
controlled
himself
,
and
,
resting
with
an
elbow
on
one
knee
,
and
his
head
upon
that
hand
,
could
look
towards
Rachael
.
<EOS>
Seen
across
the
dim
candle
with
his
moistened
eyes
,
she
looked
as
if
she
had
a
glory
shining
round
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
have
believed
she
had
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
believe
it
,
as
the
noise
without
shook
the
window
,
rattled
at
the
door
below
,
and
went
about
the
house
clamouring
and
lamenting
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
she
gets
better
,
Stephen
,
'
tis
to
be
hoped
she
'll
leave
thee
to
thyself
again
,
and
do
thee
no
more
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
Anyways
we
will
hope
so
now
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
I
shall
keep
silence
,
for
I
want
thee
to
sleep
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
closed
his
eyes
,
more
to
please
her
than
to
rest
his
weary
head
;
but
,
by
slow
degrees
as
he
listened
to
the
great
noise
of
the
wind
<EOS>
,
he
ceased
to
hear
it
,
or
it
changed
into
the
working
of
his
loom
,
or
even
into
the
voices
of
the
day
(
his
own
included
)
saying
what
had
been
really
said
.
 
<EOS>
Even
this
imperfect
consciousness
faded
away
at
last
,
and
he
dreamed
a
long
,
troubled
dream
.
   
<EOS>
He
thought
that
he
,
and
some
one
on
whom
his
heart
had
long
been
set
---
<EOS>
but
she
was
not
Rachael
,
and
that
surprised
him
,
even
in
the
midst
of
his
imaginary
happiness
---
<EOS>
stood
in
the
church
being
married
.
 
<EOS>
While
the
ceremony
was
performing
,
and
while
he
recognized
among
the
witnesses
some
whom
he
knew
to
be
living
,
and
many
whom
he
knew
to
be
dead
,
darkness
came
on
,
succeeded
by
the
shining
of
a
tremendous
light
.
 
<EOS>
It
broke
from
one
line
in
the
table
of
commandments
at
the
altar
,
and
illuminated
the
building
with
the
words
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
sounded
through
the
church
,
too
,
as
if
there
were
voices
in
the
fiery
letters
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
whole
appearance
before
him
and
around
him
changed
,
and
nothing
was
left
as
it
had
been
,
but
himself
and
the
clergyman
.
 
<EOS>
They
stood
in
the
daylight
before
a
crowd
so
vast
,
that
if
all
the
people
in
the
world
could
have
been
brought
together
into
one
space
,
they
could
not
have
looked
,
he
thought
,
more
numerous
;
and
they
all
abhorred
him
,
and
there
was
not
one
pitying
or
friendly
eye
among
the
millions
that
were
fastened
on
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
stood
on
a
raised
stage
,
under
his
own
loom
;
and
,
looking
up
at
the
shape
the
loom
took
,
and
hearing
the
burial
service
distinctly
read
,
he
knew
that
he
was
there
to
suffer
death
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
instant
what
he
stood
on
fell
below
him
,
and
he
was
gone
.
   
<EOS>
---
Out
of
what
mystery
he
came
back
to
his
usual
life
,
and
to
places
that
he
knew
,
he
was
unable
to
consider
;
but
he
was
back
in
those
places
by
some
means
,
and
with
this
condemnation
upon
him
,
that
he
was
never
,
in
this
world
or
the
next
,
through
all
the
unimaginable
ages
of
eternity
,
to
look
on
Rachael
's
face
or
hear
her
voice
.
<EOS>
Wandering
to
and
fro
,
unceasingly
,
without
hope
,
and
<EOS>
in
search
of
he
knew
not
what
<EOS>
(
he
only
knew
that
he
was
doomed
to
seek
it
)
,
he
was
the
subject
of
a
nameless
,
horrible
dread
,
a
mortal
fear
of
one
particular
shape
which
everything
took
.
 
<EOS>
Whatsoever
he
looked
at
,
grew
into
that
form
sooner
or
later
.
 
<EOS>
The
object
of
his
miserable
existence
was
to
prevent
its
recognition
by
any
one
among
the
various
people
he
encountered
.
 
<EOS>
Hopeless
labour
!
 
<EOS>
If
he
led
them
out
of
rooms
where
it
was
,
if
he
shut
up
drawers
and
closets
where
it
stood
,
if
he
drew
the
curious
from
places
where
he
knew
it
to
be
secreted
,
and
got
them
out
into
the
streets
,
the
very
chimneys
of
the
mills
assumed
that
shape
,
and
round
them
was
the
printed
word
.
   
<EOS>
The
wind
was
blowing
again
,
the
rain
was
beating
on
the
house
-
tops
,
and
the
larger
spaces
through
which
he
had
strayed
contracted
to
the
four
walls
of
his
room
.
 
<EOS>
Saving
that
the
fire
had
died
out
,
it
was
as
his
eyes
had
closed
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Rachael
seemed
to
have
fallen
into
a
doze
,
in
the
chair
by
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
She
sat
wrapped
in
her
shawl
,
perfectly
still
.
 
<EOS>
The
table
stood
in
the
same
place
,
close
by
the
bedside
,
and
on
it
,
in
its
real
proportions
and
appearance
,
was
the
shape
so
often
repeated
.
   
<EOS>
He
thought
he
saw
the
curtain
move
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
again
,
and
he
was
sure
it
moved
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
a
hand
come
forth
and
grope
about
a
little
.
<EOS>
Then
the
curtain
moved
more
perceptibly
,
and
the
woman
in
the
bed
put
it
back
,
and
sat
up
.
   
<EOS>
With
her
woful
eyes
,
so
haggard
and
wild
,
so
heavy
and
large
,
she
looked
all
round
the
room
,
and
passed
the
corner
where
he
slept
in
his
chair
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eyes
returned
to
that
corner
,
and
she
put
her
hand
over
them
as
a
shade
,
while
she
looked
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
Again
they
went
all
round
the
room
,
scarcely
heeding
Rachael
if
at
all
,
and
returned
to
that
corner
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
,
as
she
once
more
shaded
them
---
not
so
much
looking
at
him
,
as
looking
for
him
with
a
brutish
instinct
that
he
was
there
---
that
no
single
trace
was
left
in
those
debauched
features
,
or
in
the
mind
that
went
along
with
them
,
of
the
woman
he
had
married
eighteen
years
before
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
he
had
seen
her
come
to
this
by
inches
<EOS>
,
he
never
could
have
believed
her
to
be
the
same
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
as
if
a
spell
were
on
him
,
he
was
motionless
and
powerless
,
except
to
watch
her
.
   
<EOS>
Stupidly
dozing
,
or
communing
with
her
incapable
self
about
nothing
,
she
sat
for
a
little
while
with
her
hands
at
her
ears
,
and
her
head
resting
on
them
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
,
she
resumed
her
staring
round
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
her
eyes
stopped
at
the
table
with
the
bottles
on
it
.
   
<EOS>
Straightway
she
turned
her
eyes
back
to
his
corner
,
with
the
defiance
of
last
night
,
and
moving
very
cautiously
and
softly
,
stretched
out
her
greedy
hand
.
 
<EOS>
She
drew
a
mug
into
the
bed
,
and
sat
for
a
while
considering
which
of
the
two
bottles
she
should
choose
.
 
<EOS>
Finally
,
she
laid
her
insensate
grasp
upon
the
bottle
that
had
swift
and
certain
death
in
it
,
and
,
before
his
eyes
,
pulled
out
the
cork
with
her
teeth
.
   
<EOS>
Dream
or
reality
,
he
had
no
voice
,
nor
had
he
power
to
stir
.
 
<EOS>
If
this
be
real
,
and
her
allotted
time
be
not
yet
come
,
wake
,
Rachael
,
wake
!
   
<EOS>
She
thought
of
that
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
at
Rachael
,
and
very
slowly
,
very
cautiously
,
poured
out
the
contents
.
 
<EOS>
The
draught
was
at
her
lips
.
 
<EOS>
A
moment
<EOS>
and
she
would
be
past
all
help
,
let
the
whole
world
wake
and
come
about
her
with
its
utmost
power
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
that
moment
Rachael
started
up
with
a
suppressed
cry
.
 
<EOS>
The
creature
struggled
,
struck
her
,
seized
her
by
the
hair
;
but
Rachael
had
the
cup
.
   
<EOS>
Stephen
broke
out
of
his
chair
.
 
<EOS>
"
Rachael
,
am
I
wakin
'
or
dreamin
'
this
dreadfo
'
night
?
"
   
"
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
all
well
,
Stephen
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
asleep
,
myself
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
near
three
.
 
<EOS>
Hush
!
 
<EOS>
I
hear
the
bells
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
wind
brought
the
sounds
of
the
church
clock
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
They
listened
,
and
it
struck
three
.
 
<EOS>
Stephen
looked
at
her
,
saw
how
pale
she
was
,
noted
the
disorder
of
her
hair
,
and
the
red
marks
of
fingers
on
her
forehead
,
and
felt
assured
that
his
senses
of
sight
and
hearing
had
been
awake
.
 
<EOS>
She
held
the
cup
in
her
hand
even
now
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
must
be
near
three
,
"
she
said
,
calmly
pouring
from
the
cup
into
the
basin
,
and
steeping
the
linen
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
thankful
I
stayed
!
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
done
now
,
when
I
have
put
this
on
.
 
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
And
now
she
's
quiet
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
few
drops
in
the
basin
<EOS>
I
'll
pour
away
,
for
'
tis
bad
stuff
to
leave
about
,
though
ever
so
little
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
she
spoke
,
she
drained
the
basin
into
the
ashes
of
the
fire
,
and
broke
the
bottle
on
the
hearth
.
   
<EOS>
She
had
nothing
to
do
,
then
,
but
to
cover
herself
with
her
shawl
before
going
out
into
the
wind
and
rain
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thou'lt
let
me
walk
wi
'
thee
at
this
hour
,
Rachael
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Stephen
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
but
a
minute
,
and
I
'm
home
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thou'rt
not
fearfo
'
;
"
he
said
it
in
a
low
voice
,
as
they
went
out
at
the
door
;
"
to
leave
me
alone
wi
'
her
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
she
looked
at
him
,
saying
,
"
Stephen
?
<EOS>
"
he
went
down
on
his
knee
before
her
,
on
the
poor
mean
stairs
,
and
put
an
end
of
her
shawl
to
his
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thou
art
an
Angel
.
 
<EOS>
Bless
thee
,
bless
thee
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
as
I
have
told
thee
,
Stephen
,
thy
poor
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Angels
are
not
like
me
.
 
<EOS>
Between
them
,
and
a
working
woman
fu
"
of
faults
,
there
is
a
deep
gulf
set
.
 
<EOS>
My
little
sister
is
among
them
,
but
she
is
changed
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
raised
her
eyes
for
a
moment
as
she
said
the
words
;
and
then
they
fell
again
,
in
all
their
gentleness
and
mildness
,
on
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thou
changest
me
from
bad
to
good
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
mak'st
<EOS>
me
humbly
wishfo
'
to
be
more
like
thee

and
fearfo

to

thee

.
 
<EOS>
Thou'rt
an
Angel
;
it
may
be
,
thou
hast
saved
my
soul
alive
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
,
on
his
knee
at
her
feet
,
with
her
shawl
still
in
his
hand
,
and
the
reproof
on
her
lips
died
away
when
she
saw
the
working
of
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
coom
home

.
 
<EOS>
I
coom
home
<EOS>
wi'out
<EOS>
a

and

thinking
that
when
I
said
a
word
o

complaint
I
was
reckoned
a
unreasonable
Hand
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
thee
I
had
had
a
fright

<EOS>
It
were
the
Poison

on

<EOS>
I

so
suddenly
upon

How

I
might

done
to
myseln

or

or

"
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
She
put
her
two
hands
on
his
mouth
,
with
a
face
of
terror
,
to
stop
him
from
saying
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
caught
them
in
his
unoccupied
hand
,
and
holding
them
,
and
still
clasping
the
border
of
her
shawl
,
said
hurriedly
:
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
see
thee
,
Rachael
,
setten
by
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
I

aw

In

<EOS>
Evermore

there

<EOS>
I
nevermore

I
nevermore
will

in

"
   
<EOS>
He
kissed
the
border
of
her
shawl
again
,
and
let
her
go
.
 
<EOS>
She
bade
him
good
night
in
a
broken
voice
,
and
went
out
into
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
The
wind
blew
from
the
quarter
where
the
day
would
soon
appear
,
and
still
blew
strongly
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
cleared
the
sky
before
it
,
and
the
rain
had
spent
itself
or
travelled
elsewhere
,
and
the
stars
were
bright
.
 
<EOS>
He
stood
bare
-
headed
in
the
road
,
watching
her
quick
disappearance
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
shining
stars
were
to
the
heavy
candle
in
the
window
,
so
was
Rachael
,
in
the
rugged
fancy
of
this
man
,
to
the
common
experiences
of
his
life
.

Chapter

<EOS>
The
Great
Manufacturer
 
<EOS>
Time
went
on
in
Coketown
like
its
own
machinery
:
 
<EOS>
so
much
material
wrought
up
,
<EOS>
so
much
fuel
consumed
,
so
many
powers
worn
out
,
so
much
money
made
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
less
inexorable
than
iron
,
steal
,
and
brass
<EOS>
,
it
brought
its
varying
seasons
even
into
that
wilderness
of
smoke
and
brick
,
and
made
the
only
stand
that
ever
was
made
in
the
place
against
its
direful
uniformity
.
   
<EOS>
"
Louisa
is
becoming
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
"
almost
a
young
woman
.
"
   
<EOS>
Time
,
with
his
innumerable
horse
-
power
,
worked
away
,
not
minding
what
anybody
said
,
and
presently
turned
out
young
Thomas
a
foot
taller
than
when
his
father
had
last
taken
particular
notice
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thomas
is
becoming
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
"
almost
a
young
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
Time
passed
Thomas
on
in
the
mill
,
while
his
father
was
thinking
about
it
,
and
there
he
stood
in
a
long
-
tailed
coat
and
a
stiff
shirt
-
collar
.
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
"
the
period
has
arrived
when
Thomas
ought
to
go
to
Bounderby
.
"
   
<EOS>
Time
,
sticking
to
him
,
passed
him
on
into
Bounderby
's
Bank
,
made
him
an
inmate
of
Bounderby
's
house
,
necessitated
the
purchase
of
his
first
razor
,
and
exercised
him
diligently
in
his
calculations
relative
to
number
one
.
   
<EOS>
The
same
great
manufacturer
,
always
with
an
immense
variety
of
work
on
hand
,
in
every
stage
of
development
,
passed
Sissy
onward
in
his
mill
,
and
worked
her
up
into
a
very
pretty
article
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
fear
,
Jupe
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
"
that
your
continuance
at
the
school
any
longer
would
be
useless
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
it
would
,
sir
,
"
Sissy
answered
with
a
curtsey
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
disguise
from
you
,
Jupe
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
knitting
his
brow
,
"
that
the
result
of
your
probation
there
has
disappointed
me
;
has
greatly
disappointed
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
not
acquired
,
under
Mr
and
Mrs
M'Choakumchild
,
anything
like
that
amount
of
exact
knowledge
which
I
looked
for
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
extremely
deficient
in
your
facts
.
 
<EOS>
Your
acquaintance
with
figures
is
very
limited
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
altogether
backward
,
and
below
the
mark
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
,
sir
,
"
she
returned
;
"
but
I
know
it
is
quite
true
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
have
tried
hard
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
"
<EOS>
yes
,
I
believe
you
have
tried
hard
;
I
have
observed
you
,
and
I
can
find
no
fault
in
that
respect
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
thought
sometimes
;
"
Sissy
very
timid
here
;
"
that
perhaps
I
tried
to
learn
too
much
,
and
that
if
I
had
asked
to
be
allowed
to
try
a
little
less
,
I
might
have
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
No
,
Jupe
,
no
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
shaking
his
head
in
his
profoundest
and
most
eminently
practical
way
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
 
<EOS>
The
course
you
pursued
,
you
pursued
according
to
the
system
---
the
system
---
and
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
only
suppose
that
the
circumstances
of
your
early
life
were
too
unfavourable
to
the
development
of
your
reasoning
powers
,
and
that
we
began
too
late
.
<EOS>
Still
,
as
I
have
said
already
,
I
am
disappointed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
have
made
a
better
acknowledgment
,
sir
,
of
your
kindness
to
a
poor
forlorn
girl
who
had
no
claim
upon
you
,
and
of
your
protection
of
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
shed
tears
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
shed
tears
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
complain
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
an
affectionate
,
earnest
,
good
young
woman
---
and
---
and
we
must
make
that
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
,
very
much
,
"
said
Sissy
,
with
a
grateful
curtsey
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
useful
to
Mrs
Gradgrind
,
and
(
in
a
generally
pervading
way
)
you
are
serviceable
in
the
family
also
;
so
I
understand
from
Miss
Louisa
,
and
,
indeed
,
so
I
have
observed
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
hope
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
"
that
you
can
make
yourself
happy
in
those
relations
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
nothing
to
wish
,
sir
,
if
---
"
   
"
I
understand
you
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
;
"
you
still
refer
to
your
father
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
heard
from
Miss
Louisa
that
you
still
preserve
that
bottle
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
If
your
training
in
the
science
of
arriving
at
exact
results
had
been
more
successful
,
you
would
have
been
wiser
on
these
points
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
say
no
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
really
liked
Sissy
too
well
to
have
a
contempt
for
her
;
otherwise
he
held
her
calculating
powers
in
such
very
slight
estimation
that
he
must
have
fallen
upon
that
conclusion
.
 
<EOS>
Somehow
or
other
,
he
had
become
possessed
by
an
idea
that
there
was
something
in
this
girl
which
could
hardly
be
set
forth
in
a
tabular
form
.
 
<EOS>
Her
capacity
of
definition
might
be
easily
stated
at
a
very
low
figure
,
her
mathematical
knowledge
at
nothing
;
yet
he
was
not
sure
that
if
he
had
been
required
,
for
example
,
to
tick
her
off
into
columns
in
a
parliamentary
return
,
he
would
have
quite
known
how
to
divide
her
.
   
<EOS>
In
some
stages
of
his
manufacture
of
the
human
fabric
,
the
processes
of
Time
are
very
rapid
.
 
<EOS>
Young
Thomas
and
Sissy
being
both
at
such
a
stage
of
their
working
up
,
these
changes
were
effected
in
a
year
or
two
;
while
Mr
Gradgrind
himself
seemed
stationary
in
his
course
,
and
underwent
no
alteration
.
   
<EOS>
Except
one
,
which
was
apart
from
his
necessary
progress
through
the
mill
.
 
<EOS>
Time
hustled
him
into
a
little
noisy
and
rather
dirty
machinery
,
in
a
by
-
comer
,
and
made
him
Member
of
Parliament
for
Coketown
:
 
one
of
the
respected
members
for
ounce
weights
and
measures
,
one
of
the
representatives
of
the
multiplication
table
,
one
of
the
deaf
honourable
gentlemen
,
dumb
honourable
gentlemen
,
blind
honourable
gentlemen
,
lame
honourable
gentlemen
,
dead
honourable
gentlemen
,
to
every
other
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
Else
wherefore
live
we
in
a
Christian
land
,
eighteen
hundred
and
odd
years
after
our
Master
?
   
<EOS>
All
this
while
,
Louisa
had
been
passing
on
,
so
quiet
and
reserved
,
and
so
much
given
to
watching
the
bright
ashes
at
twilight
as
they
fell
into
the
grate
,
and
became
extinct
,
that
from
the
period
when
her
father
had
said
she
was
almost
a
young
woman
---
which
seemed
but
yesterday
---
she
had
scarcely
attracted
his
notice
again
,
when
he
found
her
quite
a
young
woman
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
a
young
woman
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
musing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
discovery
,
he
became
more
thoughtful
than
usual
for
several
days
,
and
seemed
much
engrossed
by
one
subject
.
 
<EOS>
On
a
certain
night
,
when
he
was
going
out
,
and
Louisa
came
to
bid
him
good
-
bye
before
his
departure
---
as
he
was
not
to
be
home
until
late
<EOS>
and
she
would
not
see
him
again
until
the
morning
---
he
held
her
in
his
arms
,
looking
at
her
in
his
kindest
manner
,
and
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Louisa
,
you
are
a
woman
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
answered
with
the
old
,
quick
,
searching
look
of
the
night
when
she
was
found
at
the
Circus
;
then
cast
down
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
father
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
"
I
must
speak
with
you
alone
and
seriously
.
 
<EOS>
Come
to
me
in
my
room
after
breakfast
to
-
morrow
,
will
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes

father

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your

rather
cold

Louisa

<EOS>
Are

not
well
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
well
,
father

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
cheerful

<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
again
,
and
smiled
in
her
peculiar
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
as
cheerful
,
father
,
as
I
usually
am
,
or
usually
have
been
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
well
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
he
kissed
her
and
went
away
;
and
Louisa
returned
to
the
serene
apartment
of
the
hair
-
cutting
character
,
and
leaning
her
elbow
on
her
hand
,
looked
again
at
the
short
-
lived
sparks
that
so
soon
subsided
into
ashes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
there
,
Loo
?
"
said
her
brother
,
looking
in
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
quite
a
young
gentleman
of
pleasure
now
,
and
not
quite
a
prepossessing
one
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Tom
,
"
she
answered
,
rising
and
embracing
him
,
"
how
long
it
is
since
you
have
been
to
see
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
have
been
otherwise
engaged
,
Loo
,
in
the
evenings
;
and
in
the
daytime
old
Bounderby
has
been
keeping
me
at
it
rather
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
touch
him
up
with
you
when
he
comes
it
too
strong
,
and
so
we
preserve
an
understanding
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
!
 
<EOS>
Has
father
said
anything
particular
to
you
to
-
day
or
yesterday
,
Loo
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
told
me
to
-
night
that
he
wished
to
do
so
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
mean
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
where
he
is
to
-
night
?
"
---
with
a
very
deep
expression
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'll
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
He
's
with
old
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
having
a
regular
confab
together
up
at
the
Bank
.
 
<EOS>
Why
at
the
Bank
,
do
you
think
?
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
'll
tell
you
again
.
 
<EOS>
To
keep
Mrs
Sparsit
's
ears
as
far
off
as
possible
,
I
expect
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
With
her
hand
upon
her
brother
's
shoulder
,
Louisa
still
stood
looking
at
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Her
brother
glanced
at
her
face
with
greater
interest
than
usual
,
and
,
encircling
her
waist
with
his
arm
,
drew
her
coaxingly
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
fond
of
me
,
an't
<EOS>
you
,
Loo
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
am
,
Tom
,
though
you
do
let
such
long
intervals
go
by
without
coming
to
see
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sister
of
mine
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
when
you
say
that
,
you
are
near
my
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
We
might
be
so
much
oftener
together
---
<EOS>
might
n't
we
?
<EOS>
Always
together
,
almost
---
might
n't
we
?
 
<EOS>
It
would
do
me
a
great
deal
of
good
if
you
were
to
make
up
your
mind
to
<EOS>
I
know
what
,
Loo
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
splendid
thing
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
uncommonly
jolly
!
"
   
<EOS>
Her
thoughtfulness
baffled
his
cunning
scrutiny
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
make
nothing
of
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
pressed
her
in
his
arm
,
and
kissed
her
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
She
returned
the
kiss
,
but
still
looked
at
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Loo
!
 
<EOS>
I
thought
I
'd
come
,
and
just
hint
to
you
what
was
going
on
:
 
though
I
supposed
you
'd
most
likely
guess
,
even
if
you
did
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
stay
,
because
I
'm
engaged
to
some
fellows
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
forget
how
fond
you
are
of
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
dear
Tom
,
I
wo
n't
forget
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
capital
girl
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
Loo
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
gave
him
an
affectionate
good
-
night
,
and
went
out
with
him
to
the
door
,
whence
the
fires
of
Coketown
could
be
seen
,
making
the
distance
lurid
.
 
<EOS>
She
stood
there
,
looking
steadfastly
towards
them
,
and
listening
to
his
departing
steps
.
 
<EOS>
They
retreated
quickly
,
as
glad
to
get
away
from
Stone
Lodge
;
and
she
stood
there
yet
,
when
he
was
gone
and
all
was
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
,
first
in
her
own
fire
within
the
house
,
and
then
in
the
fiery
haze
without
,
she
tried
to
discover
what
kind
of
woof
Old
Time
,
that
greatest
and
longest
-
established
Spinner
of
all
,
would
weave
from
the
threads
he
had
already
spun
into
a
woman
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
factory
is
a
secret
place
,
his
work
is
noiseless
,
and
his
Hands
are
mutes
.

Father
And
Daughter
 
<EOS>
Although
Mr
Gradgrind
did
not
take
after
Blue
Beard
,
his
room
was
quite
a
blue
chamber
in
its
abundance
of
blue
books
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
they
could
prove
(
which
is
usually
anything
you
like
)
,
they
proved
there
,
in
an
army
constantly
strengthening
by
the
arrival
of
new
recruits
.
 
<EOS>
In
that
charmed
apartment
,
the
most
complicated
social
questions
were
cast
up
,
got
into
exact
totals
,
and
finally
settled
---
if
those
concerned
could
only
have
been
brought
to
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
if
an
astronomical
observatory
should
be
made
without
any
windows
,
and
the
astronomer
within
should
arrange
the
starry
universe
solely
by
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
so
Mr
Gradgrind
,
in
his
Observatory
(
and
there
are
many
like
it
)
,
had
no
need
to
cast
an
eye
upon
the
teeming
myriads
of
human
beings
around
him
,
but
could
settle
all
their
destinies
on
a
slate
,
and
wipe
out
all
their
tears
with
one
dirty
little
bit
of
sponge
.
   
<EOS>
To
this
Observatory
,
then
:
 
a
stern
room
,
with
a
deadly
statistical
clock
in
it
,
which
measured
every
second
with
a
beat
like
a
rap
upon
a
coffin
-
lid
;
Louisa
repaired
on
the
appointed
morning
.
 
<EOS>
A
window
looked
towards
Coketown
;
and
when
she
sat
down
near
her
father
's
table
,
she
saw
the
high
chimneys
and
the
long
tracts
of
smoke
looming
in
the
heavy
distance
gloomily
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Louisa
,
"
said
her
father
,
"
I
prepared
you
last
night
to
give
me
your
serious
attention
in
the
conversation
we
are
now
going
to
have
together
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
been
so
well
trained
,
and
you
do
<EOS>
,
I
am
happy
to
say
,
so
much
justice
to
the
education
you
have
received
,
that
I
have
perfect
confidence
in
your
good
sense
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
not
impulsive
,
you
are
not
romantic
,
you
are
accustomed
to
view
everything
from
the
strong
dispassionate
ground
of
reason
and
calculation
.
 
<EOS>
From
that
ground
alone
,
I
know
you
will
view
and
consider
what
I
am
going
to
communicate
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
waited
,
as
if
he
would
have
been
glad
that
she
said
something
.
<EOS>
But
she
said
never
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
Louisa
,
my
dear
,
you
are
the
subject
of
a
proposal
of
marriage
that
has
been
made
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Again
he
waited
,
and
again
she
answered
not
one
word
.
 
<EOS>
This
so
far
surprised
him
,
as
to
induce
him
gently
to
repeat
,
"
a
proposal
of
marriage
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
To
which
she
returned
,
without
any
visible
emotion
whatever
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
hear
you
,
father
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
attending
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
breaking
into
a
smile
,
after
being
for
the
moment
at
a
loss
,
"
you
are
even
more
dispassionate
than
I
expected
,
Louisa
.
 
<EOS>
Or
,
perhaps
,
you
are
not
unprepared
for
the
announcement
I
have
it
in
charge
to
make
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
that
,
father
,
until
I
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
Prepared
or
unprepared
,
I
wish
to
hear
it
all
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
to
hear
you
state
it
to
me
,
father
.
"
   
<EOS>
Strange
to
relate
,
Mr
Gradgrind
was
not
so
collected
at
this
moment
as
his
daughter
was
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
a
paper
-
knife
in
his
hand
,
turned
it
over
,
laid
it
down
,
took
it
up
again
,
and
even
then
had
to
look
along
the
blade
of
it
,
considering
how
to
go
on
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
you
say
,
my
dear
Louisa
,
is
perfectly
reasonable
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
undertaken
then
to
let
you
know
that
---
in
short
,
that
Mr
Bounderby
has
informed
me
that
he
has
long
watched
your
progress
with
particular
interest
and
pleasure
,
and
has
long
hoped
that
the
time
might
ultimately
arrive
when
he
should
offer
you
his
hand
in
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
That
time
,
to
which
he
has
so
long
,
and
certainly
with
great
constancy
,
looked
forward
,
is
now
come
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
has
made
his
proposal
of
marriage
to
me
,
and
has
entreated
me
to
make
it
known
to
you
,
and
to
express
his
hope
that
you
will
take
it
into
your
favourable
consideration
.
"
   
<EOS>
Silence
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
deadly
statistical
clock
very
hollow
.
<EOS>
The
distant
smoke
very
black
and
heavy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Father
,
"
said
Louisa
,
"
do
you
think
I
love
Mr
Bounderby
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
was
extremely
discomfited
by
this
unexpected
question
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
child
,
"
he
returned
,
"
I
---
really
---
can
not
take
upon
myself
to
say
.
"
   
"
Father
,
"
pursued
Louisa
in
exactly
the
same
voice
as
before
,
"
do
you
ask
me
to
love
Mr
Bounderby
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Louisa
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
nothing
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Father
,
"
she
still
pursued
,
"
does
Mr
Bounderby
ask
me
to
love
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
"
it
is
difficult
to
answer
your
question
---
"
   
"
Difficult
to
answer
it
,
Yes
<EOS>
or
No
,
father
?
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Because
;
"
here
was
something
to
demonstrate
,
and
it
set
him
up
again
;
"
because
the
reply
depends
so
materially
,
Louisa
,
on
the
sense
in
which
we
use
the
expression
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Mr
Bounderby
does
not
do
you
the
injustice
,
and
does
not
do
himself
the
injustice
,
of
pretending
to
anything
fanciful
,
fantastic
,
or
(
I
am
using
synonymous
terms
)
sentimental
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
would
have
seen
you
grow
up
under
his
eyes
,
to
very
little
purpose
,
if
he
could
so
far
forget
what
is
due
to
your
good
sense
,
not
to
say
to
his
,
as
to
address
you
from
any
such
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
perhaps
the
expression
itself
---
I
merely
suggest
this
to
you
,
my
dear
---
may
be
a
little
misplaced
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
would
you
advise
me
to
use
in
its
stead
,
father
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
dear
Louisa
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
completely
recovered
by
this
time
,
"
<EOS>
I
would
advise
you
(
since
you
ask
me
)
to
consider
this
question
,
as
you
have
been
accustomed
to
consider
every
other
question
,
simply
as
one
of
tangible
Fact
.
 
<EOS>
The
ignorant
and
the
giddy
may
embarrass
such
subjects
with
irrelevant
fancies
,
and
other
absurdities
that
have
no
existence
,
properly
viewed
---
really
no
existence
---
but
it
is
no
compliment
to
you
to
say
,
that
you
know
better
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
what
are
the
Facts
of
this
case
?
 
<EOS>
You
are
,
we
will
say
in
round
numbers
,
twenty
years
of
age
;
Mr
Bounderby
is
,
we
will
say
in
round
numbers
,
fifty
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
some
disparity
in
your
respective
years
,
but
in
your
means
and
positions
there
is
none
;
on
the
contrary
,
there
is
a
great
suitability
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
question
arises
,
Is
this
one
disparity
sufficient
to
operate
as
a
bar
to
such
a
marriage
?
 
<EOS>
In
considering
this
question
,
it
is
not
unimportant
to
take
into
account
the
statistics
of
marriage
,
so
far
as
they
have
yet
been
obtained
,
in
England
and
Wales
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
,
on
reference
to
the
figures
,
that
a
large
proportion
of
these
marriages
are
contracted
between
parties
of
very
unequal
ages
,
and
that
the
elder
of
these
contracting
parties
is
,
in
rather
more
than
three
-
fourths
of
these
instances
,
the
bridegroom
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
remarkable
as
showing
the
wide
prevalence
of
this
law
,
that
among
the
natives
of
the
British
possessions
in
India
,
also
in
a
considerable
part
of
China
,
and
among
the
Calmucks
of
Tartary
,
the
best
means
of
computation
yet
furnished
us
by
travellers
,
yield
similar
results
.
<EOS>
The
disparity
I
have
mentioned
,
therefore
,
almost
ceases
to
be
disparity
,
and
(
virtually
)
all
but
disappears
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
recommend
,
father
,
"
asked
Louisa
,
her
reserved
composure
not
in
the
least
affected
by
these
gratifying
results
,
"
that
I
should
substitute
for
the
term
I
used
just
now
?
 
<EOS>
For
the
misplaced
expression
?
"
   
"
Louisa
,
"
returned
her
father
,
"
it
appears
to
me
that
nothing
can
be
plainer
.
 
<EOS>
Confining
yourself
rigidly
to
Fact
,
the
question
of
Fact
you
state
to
yourself
is
:
 
<EOS>
Does
Mr
Bounderby
ask
me
to
marry
him
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
he
does
.
 
<EOS>
The
sole
remaining
question
then
is
:
 
Shall
I
marry
him
?
 
<EOS>
I
think
nothing
can
be
plainer
than
that
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
marry
him
?
"
<EOS>
repeated
Louisa
,
with
great
deliberation
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Precisely
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
is
satisfactory
to
me
,
as
your
father
,
my
dear
Louisa
,
to
know
that
you
do
not
come
to
the
consideration
of
that
question
with
the
previous
habits
of
mind
,
and
habits
of
life
,
<EOS>
that
belong
to
many
young
women
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
father
,
"
she
returned
,
"
I
do
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
now
leave
you
to
judge
for
yourself
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
stated
the
case
,
as
such
cases
are
usually
stated
among
practical
minds
;
I
have
stated
it
,
as
the
case
of
your
mother
and
myself
was
stated
in
its
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
,
my
dear
Louisa
,
is
for
you
to
decide
.
"
   
<EOS>
From
the
beginning
,
she
had
sat
looking
at
him
fixedly
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
now
leaned
back
in
his
chair
,
and
bent
his
deep
-
set
eyes
upon
her
in
his
turn
,
perhaps
he
might
have
seen
one
wavering
moment
in
her
,
when
she
was
impelled
to
throw
herself
upon
his
breast
,
and
give
him
the
pent
-
up
confidences
of
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
to
see
it
,
he
must
have
overleaped
at
a
bound
the
artificial
barriers
he
had
for
many
years
been
erecting
,
between
himself
and
all
those
subtle
essences
of
humanity
which
will
elude
the
utmost
cunning
of
algebra
until
the
last
trumpet
ever
to
be
sounded
shall
blow
even
algebra
to
wreck
.
 
<EOS>
The
barriers
were
too
many
and
too
high
for
such
a
leap
.
<EOS>
With
his
unbending
,
utilitarian
,
matter
-
of
-
fact
face
,
he
hardened
her
again
;
and
the
moment
shot
away
into
the
plumbless
depths
of
the
past
,
to
mingle
with
all
the
lost
opportunities
that
are
drowned
there
.
   
<EOS>
Removing
her
eyes
from
him
,
she
sat
so
long
looking
silently
towards
the
town
,
that
he
said
,
at
length
:
 
"
Are
you
consulting
the
chimneys
of
the
Coketown
works
,
Louisa
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
seems
to
be
nothing
there
but
languid
and
monotonous
smoke
.
<EOS>
Yet
when
the
night
comes
,
Fire
bursts
out
,
father
!
"
<EOS>
she
answered
,
turning
quickly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
I
know
that
,
Louisa
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
the
application
of
the
remark
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
To
do
him
justice
he
did
not
,
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
She
passed
it
away
with
a
slight
motion
of
her
hand
,
and
concentrating
her
attention
upon
him
again
,
said
,
"
Father
,
I
have
often
thought
that
life
is
very
short
.
"
<EOS>
---
This
was
so
distinctly
one
of
his
subjects
that
he
interposed
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
short
,
no
doubt
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
the
average
duration
of
human
life
is
proved
to
have
increased
of
late
years
.
 
<EOS>
The
calculations
of
various
life
assurance
and
annuity
offices
,
among
other
figures
which
can
not
go
wrong
,
have
established
the
fact
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
speak
of
my
own
life
,
father
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
indeed
?
 
<EOS>
Still
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
"
I
need
not
point
out
to
you
,
Louisa
,
that
it
is
governed
by
the
laws
which
govern
lives
in
the
aggregate
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
While
it
lasts
,
I
would
wish
to
do
the
little
I
can
,
and
the
little
I
am
fit
for
.
 
<EOS>
What
does
it
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
seemed
rather
at
a
loss
to
understand
the
last
four
words
;
replying
,
"
How
,
matter
?
 
<EOS>
What
matter
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Mr
Bounderby
,
"
she
went
on
in
a
steady
,
straight
way
,
without
regarding
this
,
"
asks
me
to
marry
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
question
I
have
to
ask
myself
is
,
shall
I
marry
him
?
 
<EOS>
That
is
so
<EOS>
,
father
,
is
it
not
?
 
<EOS>
You
have
told
me
so
,
father
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
it
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
Since
Mr
Bounderby
likes
to
take
me
thus
,
I
am
satisfied
to
accept
his
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
him
,
father
,
as
soon
as
you
please
,
that
this
was
my
answer
.
 
<EOS>
Repeat
it
,
word
for
word
,
if
you
can
,
because
I
should
wish
him
to
know
what
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
quite
right
,
my
dear
,
"
retorted
her
father
approvingly
,
"
to
be
exact
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
observe
your
very
proper
request
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
any
wish
in
reference
to
the
period
of
your
marriage
,
my
child
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
None
,
father
.
 
<EOS>
What
does
it
matter
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
had
drawn
his
chair
a
little
nearer
to
her
,
and
taken
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
her
repetition
of
these
words
seemed
to
strike
with
some
little
discord
on
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
He
paused
to
look
at
her
,
and
,
still
holding
her
hand
,
said
:
   
"
Louisa
,
I
have
not
considered
it
essential
to
ask
you
one
question
,
because
the
possibility
implied
in
it
appeared
to
me
to
be
too
remote
.
 
<EOS>
But
perhaps
I
ought
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
never
entertained
in
secret
any
other
proposal
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Father
,
"
she
returned
,
almost
scornfully
,
"
what
other
proposal
can
have
been
made
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
Whom
have
I
seen
?
 
<EOS>
Where
have
I
been
?
 
<EOS>
What
are
my
heart
's
experiences
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Louisa
,
"
returned
Mr
Gradgrind
,
reassured
and
satisfied
.
<EOS>
"
You
correct
me
justly
.
 
<EOS>
I
merely
wished
to
discharge
my
duty
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
I
know
,
father
,
"
said
Louisa
in
her
quiet
manner
,
"
of
tastes
and
fancies
;
of
aspirations
and
affections
;
of
all
that
part
of
my
nature
in
which
such
light
things
might
have
been
nourished
?
<EOS>
What
escape
have
I
had
from
problems
that
could
be
demonstrated
,
and
realities
that
could
be
grasped
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
As
she
said
it
,
she
unconsciously
closed
her
hand
,
as
if
upon
a
solid
object
,
and
slowly
opened
it
as
though
she
were
releasing
dust
or
ash
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
assented
her
eminently
practical
parent
,
"
quite
true
,
quite
true
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
father
,
"
she
pursued
,
"
what
a
strange
question
to
ask
me
!
<EOS>
The
baby
-
preference
that
even
I
have
heard
of
as
common
among
children
,
has
never
had
its
innocent
resting
-
place
in
my
breast
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
so
careful
of
me
,
that
I
never
had
a
child
's
heart
.
<EOS>
You
have
trained
me
so
well
,
that
I
never
dreamed
a
child
's
dream
.
<EOS>
You
have
dealt
so
wisely
with
me
,
father
,
from
my
cradle
to
this
hour
,
that
I
never
had
a
child
's
belief
or
a
child
's
fear
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
was
quite
moved
by
his
success
,
and
by
this
testimony
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Louisa
,
"
said
he
,
"
you
abundantly
repay
my
care
.
<EOS>
Kiss
me
,
my
dear
girl
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
,
his
daughter
kissed
him
.
 
<EOS>
Detaining
her
in
his
embrace
,
he
said
,
"
I
may
assure
you
now
,
my
favourite
child
,
that
I
am
made
happy
by
the
sound
decision
at
which
you
have
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
is
a
very
remarkable
man
;
and
what
little
disparity
can
be
said
to
exist
between
you
<EOS>
---
if
any
---
is
more
than
counterbalanced
by
the
tone
your
mind
has
acquired
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
always
been
my
object
so
to
educate
you
,
as
that
you
might
,
while
still
in
your
early
youth
,
be
(
if
I
may
so
express
myself
)
almost
any
age
.
<EOS>
Kiss
me
once
more
,
Louisa
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
let
us
go
and
find
your
mother
.
"
   
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
they
went
down
to
the
drawing
-
room
,
where
the
esteemed
lady
with
no
nonsense
about
her
,
was
recumbent
as
usual
,
while
Sissy
worked
beside
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
gave
some
feeble
signs
of
returning
animation
when
they
entered
,
and
presently
the
faint
transparency
was
presented
in
a
sitting
attitude
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Gradgrind
,
"
said
her
husband
,
who
had
waited
for
the
achievement
of
this
feat
with
some
impatience
,
"
allow
me
to
present
to
you
<EOS>
Mrs
Bounderby
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Mrs
Gradgrind
,
"
<EOS>
so
you
have
settled
it
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
'm
sure
I
hope
your
health
may
be
good
,
Louisa
;
for
if
your
head
begins
to
split
as
soon
as
you
are
married
,
which
was
the
case
with
mine
,
I
can
not
consider
that
you
are
to
be
envied
,
though
I
have
no
doubt
<EOS>
you
think
you
are
,
as
all
girls
do
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
give
you
joy
,
my
dear
---
<EOS>
and
I
hope
you
may
now
turn
all
your
ological
studies
to
good
account
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
I
do
!
 
<EOS>
I
must
give
you
a
kiss
of
congratulation
,
Louisa
;
but
do
n't
touch
my
right
shoulder
,
for
there
's
something
running
down
it
all
day
long
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
you
see
,
"
whimpered
Mrs
Gradgrind
,
adjusting
her
shawls
after
the
affectionate
ceremony
,
"
I
shall
be
worrying
myself
,
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
,
to
know
what
I
am
to
call
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Gradgrind
,
"
said
her
husband
,
solemnly
,
"
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Whatever
I
am
to
call
him
,
Mr
Gradgrind
,
when
he
is
married
to
Louisa
!
 
<EOS>
I
must
call
him
something
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
impossible
,
"
said
Mrs
Gradgrind
,
with
a
mingled
sense
of
politeness
and
injury
,
"
to
be
constantly
addressing
him
and
never
giving
him
a
name
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
call
him
Josiah
,
for
the
name
<EOS>
is
insupportable
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
yourself
would
n't
hear
of
Joe
,
you
very
well
know
.
 
<EOS>
Am
I
to
call
my
own
son
-
in
-
law
,
Mister
!
 
<EOS>
Not
,
I
believe
,
unless
the
time
has
arrived
when
,
as
an
invalid
,
I
am
to
be
trampled
upon
by
my
relations
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
what
am
I
to
call
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
Nobody
present
having
any
suggestion
to
offer
in
the
remarkable
emergency
,
Mrs
Gradgrind
departed
this
life
for
the
time
being
,
after
delivering
the
following
codicil
to
her
remarks
already
executed
:
   
"
<EOS>
As
to
the
wedding
,
all
I
ask
,
Louisa
,
is
,
---
and
I
ask
it
with
a
fluttering
in
my
chest
,
which
actually
extends
to
the
soles
of
my
feet
,
---
that
it
may
take
place
soon
.
 
<EOS>
Otherwise
,
I
know
it
is
one
of
those
subjects
I
shall
never
hear
the
last
of
.
"
   
<EOS>
When
Mr
Gradgrind
had
presented
Mrs
Bounderby
,
Sissy
had
suddenly
turned
her
head
,
and
looked
,
in
wonder
,
in
pity
,
in
sorrow
,
in
doubt
,
in
a
multitude
of
emotions
,
towards
Louisa
.
 
<EOS>
Louisa
had
known
it
,
and
seen
it
,
without
looking
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
From
that
moment
she
was
impassive
,
proud
and
cold
---
held
Sissy
at
a
distance
---
<EOS>
changed
to
her
altogether
.

<EOS>
Husband
And
Wife
 
<EOS>
Mr
 
Bounderby
's
first
disquietude
on
hearing
of
his
happiness
,
was
occasioned
by
the
necessity
of
imparting
it
to
Mrs
Sparsit
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
make
up
his
mind
how
to
do
that
,
or
what
the
consequences
of
the
step
might
be
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
she
would
instantly
depart
,
bag
and
baggage
,
to
Lady
Scadgers
,
or
would
positively
refuse
to
budge
from
the
premises
;
whether
she
would
be
plaintive
or
abusive
,
tearful
or
tearing
;
whether
she
would
break
her
heart
,
or
break
the
looking
-
glass
;
Mr
Bounderby
could
not
all
foresee
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
as
it
must
be
done
,
he
had
no
choice
but
to
do
it
;
so
,
after
attempting
several
letters
,
and
failing
in
them
all
,
he
resolved
to
do
it
by
word
of
mouth
.
   
<EOS>
On
his
way
home
,
on
the
evening
he
set
aside
for
this
momentous
purpose
,
he
took
the
precaution
of
stepping
into
a
chemist
's
shop
and
buying
a
bottle
of
the
very
strongest
smelling
-
salts
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
George
!
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
,
"
if
she
takes
it
in
the
fainting
way
,
I
'll
have
the
skin
off
her
nose
,
at
all
events
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
spite
of
being
thus
forearmed
,
he
entered
his
own
house
with
anything
but
a
courageous
air
;
and
appeared
before
the
object
of
his
misgivings
,
like
a
dog
who
was
conscious
of
coming
direct
from
the
pantry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
evening
,
Mr
Bounderby
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
evening
,
ma'am
,
good
evening
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
drew
up
his
chair
,
and
Mrs
Sparsit
drew
back
hers
,
as
who
should
say
,
"
Your
fireside
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
freely
admit
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
for
you
to
occupy
it
all
,
if
you
think
proper
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
go
to
the
North
Pole
,
ma'am
!
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
and
returned
,
though
short
of
her
former
position
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
sat
looking
at
her
,
as
,
with
the
points
of
a
stiff
,
sharp
pair
of
scissors
,
she
picked
out
holes
for
some
inscrutable
ornamental
purpose
,
in
a
piece
of
cambric
.
 
<EOS>
An
operation
which
,
taken
in
connexion
with
the
bushy
eyebrows
and
the
Roman
nose
,
suggested
with
some
liveliness
the
idea
of
a
hawk
engaged
upon
the
eyes
of
a
tough
little
bird
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
so
steadfastly
occupied
,
that
many
minutes
elapsed
before
she
looked
up
from
her
work
;
when
she
did
so
Mr
Bounderby
bespoke
her
attention
with
a
hitch
of
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Sparsit
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
,
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
assuring
himself
with
his
right
hand
that
the
cork
of
the
little
bottle
was
ready
for
use
<EOS>
,
"
I
have
no
occasion
to
say
to
you
,
that
you
are
not
only
a
lady
born
and
bred
,
but
a
devilish
sensible
woman
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
returned
the
lady
,
"
this
is
indeed
not
the
first
time
that
you
have
honoured
me
with
similar
expressions
of
your
good
opinion
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Sparsit
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
,
"
I
am
going
to
astonish
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
?
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
,
interrogatively
,
and
in
the
most
tranquil
manner
possible
.
 
<EOS>
She
generally
wore
mittens
,
and
she
now
laid
down
her
work
,
and
smoothed
those
mittens
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
"
to
marry
Tom
Gradgrind
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
may
be
happy
,
Mr
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
indeed
I
hope
you
may
be
happy
,
sir
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
she
said
it
with
such
great
condescension
as
well
as
with
such
great
compassion
for
him
,
that
Bounderby
,
---
far
more
disconcerted
than
if
she
had
thrown
her
workbox
at
the
mirror
,
or
swooned
on
the
hearthrug
,
---
corked
up
the
smelling
-
salts
tight
in
his
pocket
,
and
thought
,
"
Now
confound
this
woman
,
who
could
have
even
guessed
that
she
would
take
it
in
this
way
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
with
all
my
heart
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
in
a
highly
superior
manner
;
somehow
she
seemed
,
in
a
moment
,
to
have
established
a
right
to
pity
him
ever
afterwards
;
"
that
you
may
be
in
all
respects
very
happy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ma'am
,
"
returned
Bounderby
,
with
some
resentment
in
his
tone
:
 
which
was
clearly
lowered
,
though
in
spite
of
himself
,
"
I
am
obliged
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
be
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
,
sir
!
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
with
great
affability
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
naturally
you
do
;
of
course
you
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
very
awkward
pause
on
Mr
Bounderby
's
part
,
succeeded
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
sedately
resumed
her
work
and
occasionally
gave
a
small
cough
,
which
sounded
like
the
cough
of
conscious
strength
and
forbearance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ma'am
,
"
resumed
Bounderby
,
"
<EOS>
under
these
circumstances
,
I
imagine
it
would
not
be
agreeable
to
a
character
like
yours
to
remain
here
,
though
you
would
be
very
welcome
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
<EOS>
no
,
sir
,
I
could
on
no
account
think
of
that
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
shook
her
head
,
still
in
her
highly
superior
manner
,
and
a
little
changed
the
small
cough
---
coughing
now
,
as
if
the
spirit
of
prophecy
rose
within
her
,
but
had
better
be
coughed
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
However
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
"
there
are
apartments
at
the
Bank
,
where
a
born
and
bred
lady
,
as
keeper
of
the
place
,
would
be
rather
a
catch
than
otherwise
;
and
if
the
same
terms
---
"
   
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
so
good
as
to
promise
that
you
would
always
substitute
the
phrase
,
annual
compliment
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ma'am
,
annual
compliment
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
same
annual
compliment
would
be
acceptable
there
,
why
,
I
see
nothing
to
part
us
,
unless
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
proposal
is
like
yourself
,
and
if
the
position
I
shall
assume
at
the
Bank
is
one
that
I
could
occupy
without
descending
lower
in
the
social
scale
---
"
   
"
Why
,
of
course
it
is
,
"
said
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
it
was
not
,
ma'am
,
you
do
n't
suppose
that
I
should
offer
it
to
a
lady
who
has
moved
in
the
society
you
have
moved
in
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
I
care
for
such
society
,
you
know
!
 
<EOS>
But
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
 
Bounderby
,
you
are
very
considerate
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
have
your
own
private
apartments
,
and
you
'll
have
your
coals
and
your
candles
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
,
and
you
'll
have
your
maid
to
attend
upon
you
,
and
you
'll
have
your
light
porter
to
protect
you
,
and
you
'll
be
what
I
take
the
liberty
of
considering
precious
comfortable
,
"
said
Bounderby
.
    
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
rejoined
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
say
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
In
yielding
up
my
trust
here
,
I
shall
not
be
freed
from
the
necessity
of
eating
the
bread
of
dependence
:
"
she
might
have
said
the
sweetbread
,
for
that
delicate
article
in
a
savoury
brown
sauce
was
her
favourite
supper
:
"
and
I
would
rather
receive
it
from
your
hand
,
than
from
any
other
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
sir
,
I
accept
your
offer
gratefully
,
and
with
many
sincere
acknowledgments
for
past
favours
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
hope
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
concluding
in
an
impressively
compassionate
manner
,
<EOS>
"
I
fondly
hope
that
Miss
Gradgrind
may
be
all
you
desire
,
and
deserve
!
"
   
<EOS>
Nothing
moved
Mrs
Sparsit
from
that
position
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
for
Bounderby
to
bluster
or
to
assert
himself
in
any
of
his
explosive
ways
;
Mrs
Sparsit
was
resolved
to
have
compassion
on
him
,
as
a
Victim
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
polite
,
obliging
,
cheerful
,
hopeful
;
but
,
<EOS>
the
more
polite
,
the
more
obliging
,
the
more
cheerful
,
the
more
hopeful
,
the
more
exemplary
altogether
,
she
;
the
forlorner
Sacrifice
and
Victim
,
he
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
that
tenderness
for
his
melancholy
fate
,
that
his
great
red
countenance
used
to
break
out
into
cold
perspirations
when
she
looked
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
marriage
was
appointed
to
be
solemnized
in
eight
weeks
'
time
,
and
Mr
Bounderby
went
every
evening
to
Stone
Lodge
as
an
accepted
wooer
.
 
<EOS>
Love
was
made
on
these
occasions
in
the
form
of
bracelets
;
and
,
on
all
occasions
during
the
period
of
betrothal
,
took
a
manufacturing
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
Dresses
were
made
,
jewellery
was
made
,
cakes
and
gloves
were
made
,
settlements
were
made
,
and
an
extensive
assortment
of
Facts
did
appropriate
honour
to
the
contract
.
 
<EOS>
The
business
was
all
Fact
,
from
first
to
last
.
 
<EOS>
The
Hours
did
not
go
through
any
of
those
rosy
performances
,
which
foolish
poets
have
ascribed
to
them
at
such
times
;
neither
did
the
clocks
go
any
faster
,
or
any
slower
,
than
at
other
seasons
.
 
<EOS>
The
deadly
statistical
recorder
in
the
Gradgrind
observatory
knocked
every
second
on
the
head
as
it
was
born
,
and
buried
it
with
his
accustomed
regularity
.
   
<EOS>
So
the
day
came
,
as
all
other
days
come
to
people
who
will
only
stick
to
reason
;
and
when
it
came
,
there
were
married
in
the
church
of
the
florid
wooden
legs
---
that
popular
order
of
architecture
---
Josiah
Bounderby
Esquire
of
Coketown
,
to
Louisa
eldest
daughter
of
Thomas
Gradgrind
Esquire
of
Stone
Lodge
,
MP
for
that
borough
.
<EOS>
And
when
they
were
united
in
holy
matrimony
,
they
went
home
to
breakfast
at
Stone
Lodge
aforesaid
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
an
improving
party
assembled
on
the
auspicious
occasion
,
who
knew
what
everything
they
had
to
eat
and
drink
was
made
of
,
and
how
it
was
imported
or
exported
,
and
in
what
quantities
,
and
in
what
bottoms
,
whether
native
or
foreign
,
and
all
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
bridesmaids
,
down
to
little
Jane
Gradgrind
,
were
,
in
an
intellectual
point
of
view
,
fit
helpmates
for
the
calculating
boy
;
and
there
was
no
nonsense
about
any
of
the
company
.
   
<EOS>
After
breakfast
,
the
bridegroom
addressed
them
in
the
following
terms
:
   
"
Ladies
and
gentlemen
,
I
am
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
.
 
<EOS>
Since
you
have
done
my
wife
and
myself
the
honour
of
drinking
our
healths
and
happiness
,
I
suppose
I
must
acknowledge
the
same
;
though
,
as
you
all
know
me
,
and
know
what
I
am
,
and
what
my
extraction
was
,
you
wo
n't
expect
a
speech
from
a
man
who
,
when
he
sees
a
Post
,
says
"
that
's
a
Post
,
"
and
when
he
sees
a
Pump
,
says
"
that
's
a
Pump
,
"
and
is
not
to
be
got
to
call
a
Post
a
Pump
,
or
a
Pump
a
Post
,
or
either
of
them
a
Toothpick
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
want
a
speech
this
morning
,
my
friend
and
father
-
in
-
law
,
Tom
Gradgrind
,
is
a
Member
of
Parliament
,
and
you
know
where
to
get
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
your
man
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
if
I
feel
a
little
independent
when
I
look
around
this
table
to
-
day
,
and
reflect
how
little
I
thought
of
marrying
Tom
Gradgrind
's
daughter
when
I
was
a
ragged
street
-
boy
,
who
never
washed
his
face
unless
it
was
at
a
pump
,
and
that
not
oftener
than
once
a
fortnight
,
I
hope
I
may
be
excused
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
I
hope
you
like
my
feeling
independent
;
if
you
do
n't
,
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
feel
independent
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
have
mentioned
,
and
you
have
mentioned
,
that
I
am
this
day
married
to
Tom
Gradgrind
's
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
glad
to
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
long
been
my
wish
to
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
watched
her
bringing
-
up
,
and
I
believe
she
is
worthy
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
---
not
to
deceive
you
---
I
believe
I
am
worthy
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
I
thank
you
,
on
both
our
parts
,
for
the
good
-
will
you
have
shown
towards
us
;
and
<EOS>
the
best
wish
I
can
give
the
unmarried
part
of
the
present
company
,
is
this
:
I
hope
every
bachelor
may
find
as
good
a
wife
as
I
have
found
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
hope
every
spinster
may
find
as
good
a
husband
as
my
wife
has
found
.
"
   
<EOS>
Shortly
after
which
oration
,
as
they
were
going
on
a
nuptial
trip
to
Lyons
,
in
order
that
Mr
Bounderby
might
take
the
opportunity
of
seeing
how
the
Hands
got
on
in
those
parts
,
and
whether
they
,
too
,
required
to
be
fed
with
gold
spoons
;
the
happy
pair
departed
for
the
railroad
.
 
<EOS>
The
bride
,
in
passing
down
-
stairs
,
dressed
for
her
journey
,
found
Tom
waiting
for
her
---
flushed
,
either
with
his
feelings
,
or
the
vinous
part
of
the
breakfast
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
game
girl
you
are
,
to
be
such
a
first
-
rate
sister
,
Loo
!
"
whispered
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
She
clung
to
him
as
she
should
have
clung
to
some
far
better
nature
that
day
,
and
was
a
little
shaken
in
her
reserved
composure
for
the
first
time
.
   
<EOS>
"
Old
Bounderby
's
quite
ready
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Time
's
up
.
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
on
the
look
-
out
for
you
,
when
you
come
back

<EOS>
I

,
my

Effects
in
the
Bank
 
<EOS>
A
sunny
midsummer
day
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
such
a
thing
sometimes
,
even
in
Coketown
.
   
<EOS>
Seen
from
a
distance
in
such
weather
,
Coketown
lay
shrouded
in
a
haze
of
its
own
,
which
appeared
impervious
to
the
sun
's
rays
.
 
<EOS>
You
only
knew
the
town
was
there
,
because
you
knew
there
could
have
been
no
such
sulky
blotch
upon
the
prospect
without
a
town
.
 
<EOS>
A
blur
of
soot
and
smoke
,
now
confusedly
tending
this
way
,
now
that
way
,
now
aspiring
to
the
vault
of
Heaven
,
now
murkily
creeping
along
the
earth
,
as
the
wind
rose
and
fell
,
or
changed
its
quarter
:
 
a
dense
formless
jumble
,
with
sheets
of
cross
light
in
it
,
that
showed
nothing
but
masses
of
darkness
:
---
Coketown
in
the
distance
was
suggestive
of
itself
,
though
not
a
brick
of
it
could
be
seen
.
   
<EOS>
The
wonder
was
,
it
was
there
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
been
ruined
so
often
,
that
it
was
amazing
how
it
had
borne
so
many
shocks
.
 
<EOS>
Surely
there
never
was
such
fragile
china
-
ware
as
that
of
which
the
millers
of
Coketown
were
made
.
 
<EOS>
Handle
them
never
so
lightly
,
and
they
fell
to
pieces
with
such
ease
that
you
might
suspect
them
of
having
been
flawed
before
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
ruined
,
when
they
were
required
to
send
labouring
children
to
school
;
they
were
ruined
when
inspectors
were
appointed
to
look
into
their
works
;
they
were
ruined
,
when
such
inspectors
considered
it
doubtful
whether
they
were
quite
justified
in
chopping
people
up
with
their
machinery
;
they
were
utterly
undone
,
when
it
was
hinted
that
perhaps
they
need
not
always
make
quite
so
much
smoke
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
Mr
Bounderby
's
gold
spoon
which
was
generally
received
in
Coketown
,
another
prevalent
fiction
was
very
popular
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
took
the
form
of
a
threat
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
a
Coketowner
felt
he
was
ill
-
used
---
that
is
to
say
,
whenever
he
was
not
left
entirely
alone
,
and
it
was
proposed
to
hold
him
accountable
for
the
consequences
of
any
of
his
acts
---
he
was
sure
to
come
out
with
the
awful
menace
,
that
he
would
"
sooner
pitch
his
property
into
the
Atlantic
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
had
terrified
the
Home
Secretary
within
an
inch
of
his
life
,
on
several
occasions
.
   
<EOS>
However
,
the
Coketowners
were
so
patriotic
after
all
,
that
they
never
had
pitched
their
property
into
the
Atlantic
yet
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
had
been
kind
enough
to
take
mighty
good
care
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
there
it
was
,
in
the
haze
yonder
;
and
it
increased
and
multiplied
.
   
<EOS>
The
streets
were
hot
and
dusty
on
the
summer
day
,
and
the
sun
was
so
bright
that
it
even
shone
through
the
heavy
vapour
drooping
over
Coketown
,
and
could
not
be
looked
at
steadily
.
 
<EOS>
Stokers
emerged
from
low
underground
doorways
into
factory
yards
,
and
sat
on
steps
,
and
posts
,
and
palings
,
wiping
their
swarthy
visages
,
and
contemplating
coals
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
town
seemed
to
be
frying
in
oil
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
stifling
smell
of
hot
oil
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
The
steam
-
engines
shone
with
it
,
the
dresses
of
the
Hands
were
soiled
with
it
,
the
mills
throughout
their
many
stories
oozed
and
trickled
it
.
<EOS>
The
atmosphere
of
those
Fairy
palaces
was
like
the
breath
of
the
simoom
:
 
and
their
inhabitants
,
wasting
with
heat
,
toiled
languidly
in
the
desert
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
temperature
made
the
melancholy
mad
elephants
more
mad
or
more
sane
.
 
<EOS>
Their
wearisome
heads
went
up
and
down
at
the
same
rate
,
in
hot
weather
and
cold
,
wet
weather
and
dry
,
fair
weather
and
foul
.
 
<EOS>
The
measured
motion
of
their
shadows
on
the
walls
,
was
the
substitute
Coketown
had
to
show
for
the
shadows
of
rustling
woods
;
while
,
for
the
summer
hum
of
insects
,
it
could
offer
,
all
the
year
round
,
from
the
dawn
of
Monday
to
the
night
of
Saturday
,
the
whirr
of
shafts
and
wheels
.
   
<EOS>
Drowsily
they
whirred
all
through
this
sunny
day
,
making
the
passenger
more
sleepy
and
more
hot
as
he
passed
the
humming
walls
of
the
mills
.
 
<EOS>
Sun
-
blinds
,
and
sprinklings
of
water
,
a
little
cooled
the
main
streets
and
the
shops
;
but
the
mills
,
and
the
courts
and
alleys
,
baked
at
a
fierce
heat
.
 
<EOS>
Down
upon
the
river
that
was
black
and
thick
with
dye
,
some
Coketown
boys
who
were
at
large
---
a
rare
sight
there
---
rowed
a
crazy
boat
,
which
made
a
spumous
track
upon
the
water
as
it
jogged
along
,
while
every
dip
of
an
oar
stirred
up
vile
smells
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
sun
itself
,
however
beneficent
,
generally
,
was
less
kind
to
Coketown
than
hard
frost
,
and
rarely
looked
intently
into
any
of
its
closer
regions
without
engendering
more
death
than
life
.
 
<EOS>
So
does
the
eye
of
Heaven
itself
become
an
evil
eye
,
when
incapable
or
sordid
hands
are
interposed
between
it
and
the
things
it
looks
upon
to
bless
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
sat
in
her
afternoon
apartment
at
the
Bank
,
on
the
shadier
side
of
the
frying
street
.
 
<EOS>
Office
-
hours
were
over
:
 
and
at
that
period
of
the
day
,
in
warm
weather
,
she
usually
embellished
with
her
genteel
presence
,
a
managerial
board
-
room
over
the
public
office
.
 
<EOS>
Her
own
private
sitting
-
room
was
a
story
higher
,
at
the
window
of
which
post
of
observation
<EOS>
she
was
ready
,
every
morning
,
to
greet
Mr
Bounderby
,
as
he
came
across
the
road
,
with
the
sympathizing
recognition
appropriate
to
a
Victim
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
married
now
a
year
;
and
Mrs
Sparsit
had
never
released
him
from
her
determined
pity
a
moment
.
   
<EOS>
The
Bank
offered
no
violence
to
the
wholesome
monotony
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
It
was
another
red
brick
house
,
with
black
outside
shutters
,
green
inside
blinds
,
a
black
street
-
door
up
two
white
steps
,
a
brazen
door
-
plate
,
and
a
brazen
door
-
handle
full
stop
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
size
larger
than
Mr
Bounderby
's
house
,
as
other
houses
were
from
a
size
to
half
-
a
-
dozen
sizes
smaller
;
in
all
other
particulars
,
it
was
strictly
according
to
pattern
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
was
conscious
that
by
coming
in
the
evening
-
tide
among
the
desks
and
writing
implements
,
she
shed
a
feminine
,
not
to
say
also
aristocratic
,
grace
upon
the
office
.
 
<EOS>
Seated
,
with
her
needlework
or
netting
apparatus
,
at
the
window
,
she
had
a
self
-
laudatory
sense
of
correcting
,
by
her
ladylike
deportment
,
the
rude
business
aspect
of
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
impression
of
her
interesting
character
upon
her
,
Mrs
Sparsit
considered
herself
,
in
some
sort
,
the
Bank
Fairy
.
 
<EOS>
The
townspeople
who
,
in
their
passing
and
repassing
,
saw
her
there
,
regarded
her
as
the
Bank
Dragon
keeping
watch
over
the
treasures
of
the
mine
.
   
<EOS>
What
those
treasures
were
,
Mrs
Sparsit
knew
as
little
as
they
did
.
<EOS>
Gold
and
silver
coin
,
precious
paper
,
secrets
that
if
divulged
would
bring
vague
destruction
upon
vague
persons
(
generally
,
however
,
people
whom
she
disliked
)
,
were
the
chief
items
in
her
ideal
catalogue
thereof
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
rest
,
she
knew
that
after
office
-
hours
,
she
reigned
supreme
over
all
the
office
furniture
,
and
over
a
locked
-
up
iron
room
with
three
locks
,
against
the
door
of
which
strong
chamber
the
light
porter
laid
his
head
every
night
,
on
a
truckle
bed
,
that
disappeared
at
cockcrow
.
 
<EOS>
Further
,
she
was
lady
paramount
over
certain
vaults
in
the
basement
,
sharply
spiked
off
from
communication
with
the
predatory
world
;
and
over
the
relics
of
the
current
day
's
work
,
consisting
of
blots
of
ink
,
worn
-
out
pens
,
fragments
of
wafers
,
and
scraps
of
paper
torn
so
small
,
that
nothing
interesting
could
ever
be
deciphered
on
them
when
Mrs
Sparsit
tried
.
 
<EOS>
Lastly
,
she
was
guardian
over
a
little
armoury
of
cutlasses
and
carbines
,
arrayed
in
vengeful
order
above
one
of
the
official
chimney
-
pieces
;
and
over
that
respectable
tradition
never
to
be
separated
from
a
place
of
business
claiming
to
be
wealthy
---
a
row
of
fire
-
buckets
---
vessels
calculated
to
be
of
no
physical
utility
on
any
occasion
,
but
observed
to
exercise
a
fine
moral
influence
,
almost
equal
to
bullion
,
on
most
beholders
.
   
<EOS>
A
deaf
serving
-
woman
and
the
light
porter
completed
Mrs
Sparsit
's
empire
.
 
<EOS>
The
deaf
serving
-
woman
was
rumoured
to
be
wealthy
;
and
a
saying
had
for
years
gone
about
among
the
lower
orders
of
Coketown
,
that
she
would
be
murdered
some
night
when
the
Bank
was
shut
,
for
the
sake
of
her
money
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
generally
considered
,
indeed
,
that
she
had
been
due
some
time
,
and
ought
to
have
fallen
long
ago
;
but
she
had
kept
her
life
,
and
her
situation
,
with
an
ill
-
conditioned
tenacity
that
occasioned
much
offence
and
disappointment
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
's
tea
was
just
set
for
her
on
a
pert
little
table
,
with
its
tripod
of
legs
in
an
attitude
,
which
she
insinuated
after
office
-
hours
,
into
the
company
of
the
stern
,
leathern
-
topped
,
long
board
-
table
that
bestrode
the
middle
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
light
porter
placed
the
tea
-
tray
on
it
,
knuckling
his
forehead
as
a
form
of
homage
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Bitzer
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
ma'am
,
"
returned
the
light
porter
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
very
light
porter
indeed
;
as
light
as
in
the
days
when
he
blinkingly
defined
a
horse
,
for
girl
number
twenty
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
is
shut
up
,
Bitzer
?
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
is
shut
up
,
ma'am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
pouring
out
her
tea
,
"
is
the
news
of
the
day
?
 
<EOS>
Anything
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ma'am
,
I
ca
n't
say
that
I
have
heard
anything
particular
.
<EOS>
Our
people
are
a
bad
lot
,
ma'am
;
but
that
is
no
news
,
unfortunately
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
are
the
restless
wretches
doing
now
?
"
asked
Mrs
Sparsit
.
   
<EOS>
"
Merely
going
on
in
the
old
way
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
Uniting
,
and
leaguing
,
and
engaging
to
stand
by
one
another
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
much
to
be
regretted
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
making
her
nose
more
Roman
and
her
eyebrows
more
Coriolanian
in
the
strength
of
her
severity
,
"
that
the
united
masters
allow
of
any
such
class
-
combinations
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Bitzer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Being
united
themselves
,
they
ought
one
and
all
to
set
their
faces
against
employing
any
man
who
is
united
with
any
other
man
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
have
done
that
,
ma'am
,
"
returned
Bitzer
;
"
but
it
rather
fell
through
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
pretend
to
understand
these
things
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
with
dignity
,
"
my
lot
having
been
signally
cast
in
a
widely
different
sphere
;
and
Mr
Sparsit
,
as
a
Powler
,
being
also
quite
out
of
the
pale
of
any
such
dissensions
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
know
that
these
people
must
be
conquered
,
and
that
it
's
high
time
it
was
done
,
once
for
all
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
,
"
returned
Bitzer
,
with
a
demonstration
of
great
respect
for
Mrs
Sparsit
's
oracular
authority
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
could
n't
put
it
clearer
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
,
ma'am
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
this
was
his
usual
hour
for
having
a
little
confidential
chat
with
Mrs
Sparsit
,
and
as
he
had
already
caught
her
eye
and
seen
that
she
was
going
to
ask
him
something
,
he
made
a
pretence
of
arranging
the
rulers
,
inkstands
,
and
so
forth
,
while
that
lady
went
on
with
her
tea
,
glancing
through
the
open
window
,
down
into
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
"
Has
it
been
a
busy
day
,
Bitzer
?
"
asked
Mrs
Sparsit
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
very
busy
day
,
my
lady
.
 
<EOS>
About
an
average
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
now
and
then
slided
into
my
lady
,
instead
of
ma'am
,
as
an
involuntary
acknowledgment
of
Mrs
Sparsit
's
personal
dignity
and
claims
to
reverence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
clerks
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
carefully
brushing
an
imperceptible
crumb
of
bread
and
butter
from
her
left
-
hand
mitten
,
"
are
trustworthy
,
punctual
,
and
industrious
,
of
course

"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
,
<EOS>
pretty
fair
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
usual
exception
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
held
the
respectable
office
of
general
spy
and
informer
in
the
establishment
,
for
which
volunteer
service
he
received
a
present
at
Christmas
,
over
and
above
his
weekly
wage
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
grown
into
an
extremely
clear
-
headed
,
cautious
,
prudent
young
man
,
who
was
safe
to
rise
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
His
mind
was
so
exactly
regulated
,
that
he
had
no
affections
or
passions
.
 
<EOS>
All
his
proceedings
were
the
result
of
the
nicest
and
coldest
calculation
;
and
it
was
not
without
cause
that
Mrs
Sparsit
habitually
observed
of
him
,
that
he
was
a
young
man
of
the
steadiest
principle
she
had
ever
known
.
 
<EOS>
Having
satisfied
himself
,
on
his
father
's
death
,
that
his
mother
had
a
right
of
settlement
in
Coketown
,
this
excellent
young
economist
had
asserted
that
right
for
her
with
such
a
steadfast
adherence
to
the
principle
of
the
case
,
that
she
had
been
shut
up
in
the
workhouse
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
admitted
that
he
allowed
her
half
a
pound
of
tea
a
year
,
which
was
weak
in
him
:
 
first
,
because
all
gifts
have
an
inevitable
tendency
to
pauperise
the
recipient
,
and
secondly
,
because
his
only
reasonable
transaction
in
that
commodity
would
have
been
to
buy
it
for
as
little
as
he
could
possibly
give
,
and
sell
it
for
as
much
as
he
could
possibly
get
;
it
having
been
clearly
ascertained
by
philosophers
that
in
this
is
comprised
the
whole
duty
of
man
---
not
a
part
of
man
's
duty
,
but
the
whole
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pretty
fair
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
usual
exception
,
ma'am
,
"
repeated
Bitzer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
-
h
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
shaking
her
head
over
her
tea
-
cup
,
and
taking
a
long
gulp
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Thomas
,
ma'am
,
I
doubt
Mr
Thomas
very
much

ma'am

I
do
n't
like
his
ways
at
all

"
   
<EOS>
"
Bitzer
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
in
a
very
impressive
manner
,
"
do
you
recollect
my
having
said
anything
to
you
respecting
names
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
quite
true
that
you
did
object
to
names
being
used
,
and
they
're
always
best
avoided
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Please
to
remember
that
I
have
a
charge
here
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
with
her
air
of
state
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
hold
a
trust
here
,
Bitzer
,
under
Mr
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
However
improbable
<EOS>
both
Mr
Bounderby
and
myself
might
have
deemed
it
years
ago
,
that
he
would
ever
become
my
patron
,
making
me
an
annual
compliment
,
I
can
not
but
regard
him
in
that
light
.
 
<EOS>
From
Mr
Bounderby
I
have
received
every
acknowledgment

my
social
station

and
every
recognition
of
my
family
descent

that
I
could
possibly
expect

<EOS>
More

far
more

<EOS>
Therefore

to
my
patron
I
will
be
scrupulously
true

And
I
do
not

I

not
consider
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
with
a
most
extensive
stock
on
hand
of
honour
and
morality
,
"
that
I
should
be
scrupulously
true
,
if
I
allowed
names
to
be
mentioned
under
this
roof
,
that
are
unfortunately
---
most
unfortunately
---
no
doubt
of
that
---
connected
with
his
.
"
   
<EOS>
Bitzer
knuckled
his
forehead
again
,
and
again
begged
pardon
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Bitzer
,
"
continued
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
say
an
individual
,
and
I
will
hear
you
;
say
Mr
Thomas
,
and
you
must
excuse
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
the
usual
exception
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Bitzer
,
trying
back
,
"
of
an
individual
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
-
h
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
repeated
the
ejaculation
,
the
shake
of
the
head
over
her
tea
-
cup
,
and
the
long
gulp
,
as
taking
up
the
conversation
again
at
the
point
where
it
had
been
interrupted
.
   
<EOS>
"
An
individual
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Bitzer
,
"
has
never
been
what
he
ought
to
have
been
,
since
he
first
came
into
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
dissipated
,
extravagant
idler
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
worth
his
salt
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
He
would
n't
get
it
either
,
if
he
had
n't
a
friend
and
relation
at
court
,
ma'am
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
-
h
!
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
with
another
melancholy
shake
of
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
only
hope
,
ma'am
,
"
pursued
Bitzer
,
"
that
his
friend
and
relation
may
not
supply
him
with
the
means
of
carrying
on
.
 
<EOS>
Otherwise
,
ma'am
,
we
know
out
of
whose
pocket
that
money
comes
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
-
h
!
"
sighed
Mrs
Sparsit
again
,
with
another
melancholy
shake
of
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
to
be
pitied
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
The
last
party
I
have
alluded
to
,
is
to
be
pitied
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Bitzer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Bitzer
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
pitied
the
delusion
,
always
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
an
individual
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Bitzer
,
dropping
his
voice
and
drawing
nearer
,
"
he
is
as
improvident
as
any
of
the
people
in
this
town
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
know
what
their
improvidence
is
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
could
wish
to
know
it
better
than
a
lady
of
your
eminence
does
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
would
do
well
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
to
take
example
by
you
,
Bitzer
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
since
you
do
refer
to
me
,
now
look
at
me
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
put
by
a
little
,
ma'am
,
already
.
 
<EOS>
That
gratuity
which
I
receive
at
Christmas
,
ma'am
:
 
<EOS>
I
never
touch
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
even
go
the
length
of
my
wages
,
though
they
're
not
high
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
Why
ca
n't
they
do
as
I
have
done
,
ma'am
?
 
<EOS>
What
one
person
can
do
,
another
can
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
,
again
,
was
among
the
fictions
of
Coketown
.
 
<EOS>
Any
capitalist
there
,
who
had
made
sixty
thousand
pounds
out
of
sixpence
,
always
professed
to
wonder
why
the
sixty
thousand
nearest
Hands
did
n't
each
make
sixty
thousand
pounds
out
of
sixpence
,
and
more
or
less
reproached
them
every
one
for
not
accomplishing
the
little
feat
.
<EOS>
What
I
did
you
can
do
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
go
and
do
it
?
   
<EOS>
"
As
to
their
wanting
recreations
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Bitzer
,
"
it
's
stuff
and
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
recreations
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
did
,
and
I
never
shall
;
I
do
n't
like
'em
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
their
combining
together
;
there
are
many
of
them
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
that
by
watching
and
informing
upon
one
another
could
earn
a
trifle
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
whether
in
money
or
good
will
,
and
improve
their
livelihood
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
why
do
n't
they
improve
it
,
ma'am
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
the
first
consideration
of
a
rational
creature
,
and
it
's
what
they
pretend
to
want
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pretend
indeed
!
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
we
are
constantly
hearing
,
ma'am
,
till
it
becomes
quite
nauseous
,
concerning
their
wives

families

"
said
Bitzer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
look
at
me
,
ma'am
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
a
wife

family

<EOS>
Why
should
they
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
they
are
improvident
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
,
"
returned
Bitzer
,
"
<EOS>
that
's
where
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
were
more
provident
and
less
perverse
,
ma'am
,
what
would
they
do
?
 
<EOS>
They
would
say
,
"
While
my
hat
covers
my
family
,
"
or
"
while
my
bonnet
covers
my
family
,
"
---
as
the
case
might
be
,
ma'am
---
"
I
have
only
one
to
feed

that
's
the
person
I
most
like
to
feed
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
To
be
sure
,
"
assented
Mrs
Sparsit
,
eating
muffin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Bitzer
,
knuckling
his
forehead
again
,
in
return
for
the
favour
of
Mrs
Sparsit
's
improving
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Would
you
wish
a
little
more
hot
water
,
ma'am
,
or
is
there
anything
else
that
I
could
fetch
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
just
now
,
Bitzer
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
n't
wish
to
disturb
you
at
your
meals
,
ma'am
,
particularly
tea
,
knowing
your
partiality
for
it
,
"
said
Bitzer
,
craning
a
little
to
look
over
into
the
street
from
where
he
stood
;
"
but
there
's
a
gentleman
been
looking
up
here
for
a
minute
or
so
,
ma'am
,
and
he
has
come
across
as
if
he
was
going
to
knock
.
<EOS>
That
is
his
knock
,
ma'am
,
no
doubt
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
stepped
to
the
window
;
and
looking
out
,
and
drawing
in
his
head
again
,
confirmed
himself
with
,
"
Yes
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
Would
you
wish
the
gentleman
to
be
shown
in
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
who
it
can
be
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
wiping
her
mouth
and
arranging
her
mittens
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
stranger
,
ma'am
,
evidently
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
stranger
can
want
at
the
Bank
at
this
time
of
the
evening
,
unless
he
comes
upon
some
business
for
which
he
is
too
late
,
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
but
I
hold
a
charge
in
this
establishment
from
Mr
Bounderby
,
and
I
will
never
shrink
from
it
.
<EOS>
If
to
see
him
is
any
part
of
the
duty
I
have
accepted
,
I
will
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
Use
your
own
discretion
,
Bitzer
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
the
visitor
,
all
unconscious
of
Mrs
Sparsit
's
magnanimous
words
,
repeated
his
knock
so
loudly
that
the
light
porter
hastened
down
to
open
the
door
;
while
Mrs
Sparsit
took
the
precaution
of
concealing
her
little
table
,
with
all
its
appliances
upon
it
,
in
a
cupboard
,
and
then
decamped
up
-
stairs
,
that
she
might
appear
,
if
needful
,
with
the
greater
dignity
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
ma'am
,
the
gentleman
would
wish
to
see
you
,
"
said
Bitzer
,
with
his
light
eye
at
Mrs
Sparsit
's
keyhole
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
Mrs
Sparsit
,
who
had
improved
the
interval
by
touching
up
her
cap
,
took
her
classical
features
down
-
stairs
again
,
and
entered
the
board
-
room
in
the
manner
of
a
Roman
matron
going
outside
the
city
walls
to
treat
with
an
invading
general
.
   
<EOS>
The
visitor
having
strolled
to
the
window
,
and
being
then
engaged
in
looking
carelessly
out
,
was
as
unmoved
by
this
impressive
entry
as
man
could
possibly
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
stood
whistling
to
himself
with
all
imaginable
coolness
,
with
his
hat
still
on
,
and
a
certain
air
of
exhaustion
upon
him
,
in
part
arising
from
excessive
summer
,
and
in
part
from
excessive
gentility
.
 
<EOS>
For
it
was
to
be
seen
with
half
an
eye
that
he
was
a
thorough
gentleman
,
<EOS>
made
to
the
model
of
the
time
;
weary
of
everything
,
and
putting
no
more
faith
in
anything
than
Lucifer
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
sir
,
"
quoth
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
you
wished
to
see
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
he
said
,
turning
and
removing
his
hat
;
"
pray
excuse
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
<EOS>
"
thought
Mrs
Sparsit
,
as
she
made
a
stately
bend
.
 
<EOS>
"
Five
and
thirty
,
good
-
looking
,
good
figure
,
good
teeth
,
good
voice
,
good
breeding
,
well
-
dressed
,
dark
hair
,
bold
eyes
.
"
 
<EOS>
All
which
Mrs
Sparsit
observed
in
her
womanly
way
---
like
the
Sultan
who
put
his
head
in
the
pail
of
water
---
merely
in
dipping
down
and
coming
up
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Please
to
be
seated
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
Allow
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
placed
a
chair
for
her
,
but
remained
himself
carelessly
lounging
against
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
left
my
servant
at
the
railway
looking
after
the
luggage
---
very
heavy
train
and
vast
quantity
of
it
in
the
van
---
and
strolled
on
,
looking
about
me
.
<EOS>
Exceedingly
odd
place
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
allow
me
to
ask
you
if
it
's
always
as
black
as
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
general
much
blacker
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
,
in
her
uncompromising
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
possible
!
 
<EOS>
Excuse
me
:
 
<EOS>
you
are
not
a
native
,
I
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
once
my
good
or
ill
fortune
,
as
it
may
be
---
before
I
became
a
widow
---
to
move
in
a
very
different
sphere
.
 
<EOS>
My
husband
was
a
Powler
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Beg
your
pardon
,
really
!
"
said
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Was
---
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
repeated
,
"
A
Powler
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Powler
Family
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
after
reflecting
a
few
moments
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
signified
assent
.
 
<EOS>
The
stranger
seemed
a
little
more
fatigued
than
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
very
much
bored
here
?
"
was
the
inference
he
drew
from
the
communication
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
servant
of
circumstances
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
and
I
have
long
adapted
myself
to
the
governing
power
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
philosophical
,
"
returned
the
stranger
,
"
and
very
exemplary
and
laudable
,
and
---
"
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
be
scarcely
worth
his
while
to
finish
the
sentence
,
so
he
played
with
his
watch
-
chain
wearily
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
be
permitted
to
ask
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
to
what
I
am
indebted
for
the
favour
of
---
"
   
"
Assuredly
,
"
said
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Much
obliged
to
you
for
reminding
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
the
bearer
of
a
letter
of
introduction
to
Mr
Bounderby
,
the
banker
.
 
<EOS>
Walking
through
this
extraordinarily
black
town
,
while
they
were
getting
dinner
ready
at
the
hotel
<EOS>
,
I
asked
a
fellow
whom
I
met
;
one
of
the
working
people
;
who
appeared
to
have
been
taking
a
shower
-
bath
of
something
fluffy
,
which
I
assume
to
be
the
raw
material
---
"
   
Mrs
Sparsit
inclined
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
---
Raw
material
---
where
Mr
Bounderby
,
the
banker
,
might
reside
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
misled
no
doubt
by
the
word
Banker
,
he
directed
me
to
the
Bank
.
 
<EOS>
Fact
being
,
I
presume
,
that
Mr
Bounderby
the
Banker
does
not
reside
in
the
edifice
in
which
I
have
the
honour
of
offering
this
explanation
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
he
does
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
intention
of
delivering
my
letter
at
the
present
moment
,
nor
have
I.
<EOS>
But
strolling
on
to
the
Bank
to
kill
time
,
and
having
the
good
fortune
to
observe
at
the
window
,
"
towards
which
he
languidly
waved
his
hand
,
then
slightly
bowed
,
"
a
lady
of
a
very
superior
and
agreeable
appearance
,
I
considered
that
I
could
not
do
better
than
take
the
liberty
of
asking
that
lady
where
Mr
Bounderby
the
Banker
does
live
.
 
<EOS>
Which
I
accordingly
venture
,
with
all
suitable
apologies
,
to
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
inattention
and
indolence
of
his
manner
were
sufficiently
relieved
,
to
Mrs
Sparsit
's
thinking
,
by
a
certain
gallantry
at
ease
,
which
offered
her
homage
too
.
 
<EOS>
Here
he
was
,
for
instance
,
at
this
moment
,
all
but
sitting
on
the
table
,
and
yet
lazily
bending
over
her
,
as
if
he
acknowledged
an
attraction
in
her
that
made
her
charming
---
in
her
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
Banks
,
I
know
,
are
always
suspicious
,
and
officially
must
be
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
whose
lightness
and
smoothness
of
speech
were
pleasant
likewise
;
suggesting
matter
far
more
sensible
and
humorous
than
it
ever
contained
---
which
was
perhaps
a
shrewd
device
of
the
founder
of
this
numerous
sect
,
<EOS>
whosoever
may
have
been
that
great
man
:
 
<EOS>
"
therefore
I
may
observe
that
my
letter
---
here
it
is
---
is
from
the
member
for
this
place
---
Gradgrind
---
whom
I
have
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
in
London
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
recognized
the
hand
,
intimated
that
such
confirmation
was
quite
unnecessary
,
and
gave
Mr
Bounderby
's
address
,
with
all
needful
clues
and
directions
in
aid
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thousand
thanks
,
"
said
the
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
know
the
Banker
<EOS>
well
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Mrs
Sparsit
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
my
dependent
relation
towards
him
,
I
have
known
him
ten
years
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
an
eternity
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
he
married
Gradgrind
's
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
suddenly
compressing
her
mouth
,
"
he
had
that
---
honour
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
lady
is
quite
a
philosopher
,
I
am
told
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
she
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Excuse
my
impertinent
curiosity
,
"
pursued
the
stranger
,
fluttering
over
Mrs
Sparsit
's
eyebrows
,
with
a
propitiatory
air
,
"
but
you
know
the
family
,
and
know
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
about
to
know
the
family
,
and
may
have
much
to
do
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
Is
the
lady
so
very
alarming
?
 
<EOS>
Her
father
gives
her
such
a
portentously
hard
-
headed
reputation
,
that
I
have
a
burning
desire
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
Is
she
absolutely
unapproachable
?
 
<EOS>
Repellently
and
stunningly
clever
?
 
<EOS>
I
see
,
by
your
meaning
smile
,
you
think
not
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
poured
balm
into
my
anxious
soul
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
age
,
now
.
 
<EOS>
Forty
?
 
<EOS>
Five
and
thirty
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
laughed
outright
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
chit
,
"
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
twenty
when
she
was
married
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
give
you
my
honour
,
Mrs
Powler
,
"
returned
the
stranger
,
detaching
himself
from
the
table
,
"
that
I
never
was
so
astonished
in
my
life
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
really
did
seem
to
impress
him
,
to
the
utmost
extent
of
his
capacity
of
being
impressed
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
at
his
informant
for
full
a
quarter
of
a
minute
,
and
appeared
to
have
the
surprise
in
his
mind
all
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
Mrs
Powler
,
"
he
then
said
,
much
exhausted
,
"
that
the
father
's
manner
prepared
me
for
a
grim
and
stony
maturity
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
obliged
to
you
,
of
all
things
,
for
correcting
so
absurd
a
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
excuse
my
intrusion
.
 
<EOS>
Many
thanks
.
 
<EOS>
Good
day
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
bowed
himself
out
;
and
Mrs
Sparsit
,
hiding
in
the
window
curtain
,
saw
him
languishing
down
the
street
on
the
shady
side
of
the
way
,
observed
of
all
the
town
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
the
gentleman
,
Bitzer
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
the
light
porter
,
when
he
came
to
take
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
Spends
a
deal
of
money
on
his
dress
,
ma'am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
admitted
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
that
it
's
very
tasteful
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
,
"
returned
Bitzer
,
"
if
that
's
worth
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Besides
which
,
ma'am
,
"
resumed
Bitzer
,
while
he
was
polishing
the
table
,
"
he
looks
to
me
as
if
he
gamed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
immoral
to
game
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
ridiculous
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Bitzer
,
"
because
the
chances
are
against
the
players
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
that
the
heat
prevented
Mrs
Sparsit
from
working
,
or
whether
it
was
that
her
hand
was
out
,
she
did
no
work
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
She
sat
at
the
window
,
when
the
sun
began
to
sink
behind
the
smoke
;
she
sat
there
,
when
the
smoke
was
burning
red
,
when
the
colour
faded
from
it
,
when
darkness
seemed
to
rise
slowly
out
of
the
ground
,
and
creep
upward
,
upward
,
up
to
the
house
-
tops
,
up
the
church
steeple
,
up
to
the
summits
of
the
factory
chimneys
,
up
to
the
sky
.
 
<EOS>
Without
a
candle
in
the
room
,
Mrs
Sparsit
sat
at
the
window
,
with
her
hands
before
her
,
not
thinking
much
of
the
sounds
of
evening
;
the
whooping
of
boys
,
the
barking
of
dogs
,
the
rumbling
of
wheels
,
the
steps
and
voices
of
passengers
,
the
shrill
street
cries
,
the
clogs
upon
the
pavement
when
it
was
their
hour
for
going
by
,
the
shutting
-
up
of
shop
-
shutters
.
 
<EOS>
Not
until
the
light
porter
announced
that
her
nocturnal
sweetbread
was
ready
,
did
Mrs
Sparsit
arouse
herself
from
her
reverie
,
and
convey
her
dense
black
eyebrows
---
by
that
time
creased
with
meditation
,
as
if
they
needed
ironing
out
-
up
-
stairs
.
   
<EOS>
"
O
,
you
Fool
!
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
when
she
was
alone
at
her
supper
.
<EOS>
Whom
she
meant
,
she
did
not
say
;
but
she
could
scarcely
have
meant
the
sweetbread
.

Chapter
02
.
<EOS>
Mr
James
Harthouse
 
<EOS>
The
Gradgrind
party
wanted
assistance
in
cutting
the
throats
of
the
Graces
.
 
<EOS>
They
went
about
recruiting
;
and
where
could
they
enlist
recruits
more
hopefully
,
than
among
the
fine
gentlemen
who
,
having
found
out
everything
to
be
worth
nothing
,
were
equally
ready
for
anything
?
   
<EOS>
Moreover
,
the
healthy
spirits
who
had
mounted
to
this
sublime
height
were
attractive
to
many
of
the
Gradgrind
school
.
 
<EOS>
They
liked
fine
gentlemen
;
they
pretended
that
they
did
not
,
but
they
did
.
<EOS>
They
became
exhausted
in
imitation
of
them
;
and
they
yaw
-
yawed
in
their
speech
like
them
;
and
they
served
out
,
with
an
enervated
air
,
the
little
mouldy
rations
of
political
economy
,
on
which
they
regaled
their
disciples
.
 
<EOS>
There
never
before
was
seen
on
earth
such
a
wonderful
hybrid
race
as
was
thus
produced
.
   
<EOS>
Among
the
fine
gentlemen
not
regularly
belonging
to
the
Gradgrind
school
,
there
was
one
of
a
good
family
and
a
better
appearance
,
with
a
happy
turn
of
humour
which
had
told
immensely
with
the
House
of
Commons
on
the
occasion
of
his
entertaining
it
with
his
(
and
the
Board
of
Directors
)
view
of
a
railway
accident
,
in
which
the
most
careful
officers
ever
known
,
employed
by
the
most
liberal
managers
ever
heard
of
,
assisted
by
the
finest
mechanical
contrivances
ever
devised
,
the
whole
in
action
on
the
best
line
ever
constructed
,
had
killed
five
people
and
wounded
thirty
-
two
,
by
a
casualty
without
which
the
excellence
of
the
whole
system
would
have
been
positively
incomplete
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
slain
was
a
cow
,
and
among
the
scattered
articles
unowned
,
a
widow
's
cap
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
honourable
member
had
so
tickled
the
House
(
which
has
a
delicate
sense
of
humour
)
by
putting
the
cap
on
the
cow
,
that
it
became
impatient
of
any
serious
reference
to
the
Coroner
's
Inquest
,
and
brought
the
railway
off
with
Cheers
and
Laughter
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
this
gentleman
had
a
younger
brother
of
still
better
appearance
than
himself
,
who
had
tried
life
as
a
Cornet
of
Dragoons
,
and
found
it
a
bore
;
and
had
afterwards
tried
it
in
the
train
of
an
English
minister
abroad
,
and
found
it
a
bore
;
and
had
then
strolled
to
Jerusalem
,
and
got
bored
there
;
and
had
then
gone
yachting
about
the
world
,
and
got
bored
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
To
whom
this
honourable
and
jocular
,
member
fraternally
said
one
day
,
"
Jem
,
there
's
a
good
opening
among
the
hard
Fact
fellows
,
and
they
want
men
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
you
do
n't
go
in
for
statistics
.
"
 
<EOS>
Jem
,
rather
taken
by
the
novelty
of
the
idea
,
and
very
hard
up
for
a
change
,
was
as
ready
to
"
go
in
"
for
statistics
as
for
anything
else
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
he
went
in
.
 
<EOS>
He
coached
himself
up
with
a
blue
-
book
or
two
;
and
his
brother
put
it
about
among
the
hard
Fact
fellows
,
and
said
,
"
If
you
want
to
bring
in
,
for
any
place
,
a
handsome
dog
who
can
make
you
a
devilish
good
speech
,
look
after
my
brother
Jem
,
for
he
's
your
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
After
a
few
dashes
in
the
public
meeting
way
,
Mr
Gradgrind
and
a
council
of
political
sages
approved
of
Jem
,
and
it
was
resolved
to
send
him
down
to
Coketown
,
to
become
known
there
and
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
Hence
the
letter
Jem
had
last
night
shown
to
Mrs
Sparsit
,
which
Mr
Bounderby
now
held
in
his
hand
;
superscribed
,
"
Josiah
Bounderby
,
Esquire
,
Banker
,
Coketown
.
 
<EOS>
Specially
to
introduce
James
Harthouse
,
Esquire
.
 
<EOS>
Thomas
Gradgrind
.
"
   
<EOS>
Within
an
hour
of
the
receipt
of
this
dispatch
and
Mr
James
Harthouse
's
card
,
Mr
Bounderby
put
on
his
hat
and
went
down
to
the
Hotel
.
 
<EOS>
There
he
found
Mr
James
Harthouse
looking
out
of
window
,
in
a
state
of
mind
<EOS>
so
disconsolate
,
that
he
was
already
half
-
disposed
to
"
go
in
"
for
something
else
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
name
,
sir
,
"
said
his
visitor
,
"
is
Josiah
Bounderby
,
of
Coketown
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
James
Harthouse
was
very
happy
indeed
(
though
he
scarcely
looked
so
)
to
have
a
pleasure
he
had
long
expected
.
   
<EOS>
"
Coketown
,
sir
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
obstinately
taking
a
chair
,
"
is
not
the
kind
of
place
you
have
been
accustomed
to
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
if
you
will
allow
me
---
or
whether
you
will
or
not
,
for
I
am
a
plain
man
---
I
'll
tell
you
something
about
it
before
we
go
any
further
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Harthouse
would
be
charmed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
too
sure
of
that
,
"
said
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
promise
it
.
<EOS>
First
of
all
,
you
see
our
smoke
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
meat
and
drink
to
us
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
healthiest
thing
in
the
world
in
all
respects
,
and
particularly
for
the
lungs
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
are
one
of
those
who
want
us
to
consume
it
,
I
differ
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
not
going
to
wear
the
bottoms
of
our
boilers
out
any
faster
than
we
wear
'em
out
now
,
for
all
the
humbugging
sentiment
in
Great
Britain
and
Ireland
.
"
   
<EOS>
By
way
of
"
going
in
"
to
the
fullest
extent
,
Mr
Harthouse
rejoined
,
"
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
,
I
assure
you
I
am
entirely
and
completely
of
your
way
of
thinking
.
 
<EOS>
On
conviction
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
said
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
you
have
heard
a
lot
of
talk
about
the
work
in
our
mills
,
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
?
 
<EOS>
Very
good
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
state
the
fact
of
it
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
the
pleasantest
work
there
is
,
and
it
's
the
lightest
work
there
is
,
and
it
's
the
best
-
paid
work
there
is
.
 
<EOS>
More
than
that
,
we
could
n't
improve
the
mills
themselves
,
unless
we
laid
down
Turkey
carpets
on
the
floors
.
<EOS>
Which
we
're
not
a
-
going
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Bounderby
,
perfectly
right
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lastly
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
"
as
to
our
Hands
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
not
a
Hand
in
this
town
,
sir
,
man
,
woman
,
or
child
,
but
has
one
ultimate
object
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
That
object
is
,
to
be
fed
on
turtle
soup
and
venison
with
a
gold
spoon
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
they
're
not
a
-
going
---
none
of
'em
---
ever
to
be
fed
on
turtle
soup
and
venison
with
a
gold
spoon
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
you
know
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Harthouse
professed
himself
in
the
highest
degree
instructed
and
refreshed
,
by
this
condensed
epitome
of
the
whole
Coketown
question
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
see
,
"
replied
Mr
Bounderby
,
"
it
suits
my
disposition
to
have
a
full
understanding
with
a
man
,
particularly
with
a
public
man
,
when
I
make
his
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
one
thing
more
to
say
to
you
,
Mr
Harthouse
,
before
assuring
you
of
the
pleasure
with
which
I
shall
respond
,
to
the
utmost
of
my
poor
ability
,
to
my
friend
Tom
Gradgrind
's
letter
of
introduction
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
man
of
family
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
deceive
yourself
by
supposing
for
a
moment
that
I
am
a
man
of
family
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
bit
of
dirty
riff
-
raff
,
and
a
genuine
scrap
of
tag
,
rag
,
and
bobtail
.
"
   
<EOS>
If
anything
could
have
exalted
Jem
's
interest
in
Mr
Bounderby
,
it
would
have
been
this
very
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
Or
,
so
he
told
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
now
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
"
we
may
shake
hands
on
equal
terms
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
equal
terms
,
because
although
I
know
what
I
am
,
and
the
exact
depth
of
the
gutter
I
have
lifted
myself
out
of
,
better
than
any
man
does
,
I
am
as
proud
as
you
are
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
just
as
proud
as
you
are
.
<EOS>
Having
now
asserted
my
independence
in
a
proper
manner
,
I
may
come
to
how
do
you
find
yourself
,
and
I
hope
you
're
pretty
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
better
,
Mr
Harthouse
gave
him
to
understand
as
they
shook
hands
,
for
the
salubrious
air
of
Coketown

<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
received
the
answer
with
favour
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
know
,
"
said
he
,
"
or
perhaps
you
do
n't
know
<EOS>
,
I
married
Tom
Gradgrind
's
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
walk
up
town
with
me
,
I
shall
be
glad
to
introduce
you
to
Tom
Gradgrind
's
daughter
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Bounderby
,
"
said
Jem
,
"
you
anticipate
my
dearest
wishes
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
They
went
out
without
further
discourse
;
and
Mr
Bounderby
piloted
the
new
acquaintance
who
so
strongly
contrasted
with
him
,
to
the
private
red
brick
dwelling
,
with
the
black
outside
shutters
,
the
green
inside
blinds
,
and
the
black
street
door
up
the
two
white
steps
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
drawing
-
room
of
which
mansion
,
there
presently
entered
to
them
the
most
remarkable
girl
Mr
James
Harthouse
had
ever
seen
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
so
constrained
,
and
<EOS>
yet
so
careless
;
so
reserved
,
and
yet
so
watchful
;
<EOS>
so
cold
and
proud
,
and
yet
so
sensitively
ashamed
of
her
husband
's
braggart
humility
---
from
which
she
shrunk
as
if
every
example
of
it
were
a
cut
or
a
blow
;
that
it
was
quite
a
new
sensation
to
observe
her
.
 
<EOS>
In
face
she
was
no
less
remarkable
than
in
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Her
features
were
handsome
;
but
their
natural
play
was
so
locked
up
,
that
it
seemed
impossible
to
guess
at
their
genuine
expression
.
 
<EOS>
Utterly
indifferent
,
perfectly
self
-
reliant
,
never
at
a
loss
,
and
yet
never
at
her
ease
,
with
her
figure
in
company
with
them
there
,
and
her
mind
apparently
quite
alone
<EOS>
---
it
was
of
no
use
"
going
in
"
yet
awhile
to
comprehend
this
girl
,
for
she
baffled
all
penetration
.
   
<EOS>
From
the
mistress
of
the
house
,
the
visitor
glanced
to
the
house
itself
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
mute
sign
of
a
woman
in
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
No
graceful
little
adornment
,
<EOS>
no
fanciful
little
device
,
however
trivial
,
anywhere
expressed
her
influence
.
 
<EOS>
Cheerless
and
comfortless
,
boastfully
and
doggedly
rich
,
there
the
room
stared
at
its
present
occupants
,
unsoftened
and
unrelieved
by
the
least
trace
of
any
womanly
occupation
.
 
<EOS>
As
Mr
Bounderby
stood
in
the
midst
of
his
household
gods
,
so
those
unrelenting
divinities
occupied
their
places
around
Mr
Bounderby
,
and
they
were
worthy
of
one
another
,
and
well
matched
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
,
sir
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
"
is
my
wife
,
Mrs
Bounderby
:
 
Tom
Gradgrind
's
eldest
daughter

<EOS>
Loo
,
Mr
James
Harthouse

<EOS>
Mr
Harthouse
has
joined
your
father
's
muster
-
roll
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
is
not
Torn
Gradgrind
's
colleague
before
long
,
I
believe
we
shall
at
least
hear
of
him
in
connexion
with
one
of
our
neighbouring
towns
.
 
<EOS>
You
observe
,
Mr
Harthouse
,
that
my
wife
is
my
junior
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
she
saw
in
me
to
marry
me
,
but
she
saw
something
in
me
,
I
suppose
,
or
she
would
n't
have
married
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
lots
of
expensive
knowledge
,
sir
,
political
and
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
want
to
cram
for
anything
,
I
should
be
troubled
to
recommend
you
to
a
better
adviser
than
Loo
Bounderby
.
"
   
<EOS>
To
a
more
agreeable
adviser
,
or
one
from
whom
he
would
be
more
likely
to
learn
,
Mr
Harthouse
could
never
be
recommended
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
said
his
host
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
're
in
the
complimentary
line
,
you
'll
get
on
here
,
for
you
'll
meet
with
no
competition

<EOS>
I
have
never
been
in
the
way
of
learning
compliments
myself
,
and
I
do
n't
profess
to
understand
the
art
of
paying
'em
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
despise
'em
.
<EOS>
But
,
your
bringing
-
up
was
different
from
mine
;
mine
was
a
real
thing
,
by
George

<EOS>
You
're
a
gentleman
,
and
I
do
n't
pretend
to
be
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
,
and
that
's
enough
for
me
.
<EOS>
However
,
though
I
am
not
influenced
by
manners
and
station
,
Loo
Bounderby
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
n't
my
advantages

<EOS>
disadvantages
you
would
call
'em
,
but
I
call
'em
advantages

so
you
'll
not
waste
your
power

I
dare
say
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Bounderby
,
"
said
Jem
,
turning
with
a
smile
to
Louisa
,
"
is
a
noble
animal
in
a
comparatively
natural
state
,
quite
free
from
the
harness
in
which
a
conventional
hack
like
myself
works
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
respect
Mr
Bounderby
very
much
,
"
she
quietly
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
natural
that
you
should
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
disgracefully
thrown
out
,
for
a
gentleman
who
had
seen
so
much
of
the
world
,
and
thought
,
"
Now
,
how
am
I
to
take
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
going
to
devote
yourself
,
as
I
gather
from
what
Mr
Bounderby
has
said
,
to
the
service
of
your
country
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
made
up
your
mind
,
"
said
Louisa
,
still
standing
before
him
where
she
had
first
stopped
---
in
all
the
singular
contrariety
of
her
self
-
possession
,
and
her
being
obviously
very
ill
at
ease
---
"
to
show
the
nation
the
way
out
of
all
its
difficulties
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Bounderby
,
"
he
returned
,
laughing
,
"
upon
my
honour
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
make
no
such
pretence
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
a
little
,
here
and
there
,
up
and
down
;
I
have
found
it
all
to
be
very
worthless
,
as
everybody
has
,
and
as
some
confess
they
have
,
and
some
do
not
;
and
I
am
going
in
for
your
respected
father
's
opinions
---
really
because
I
have
no
choice
of
opinions
,
and
may
as
well
back
them
as
anything
else
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
none
of
your
own
?
"
asked
Louisa
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
so
much
as
the
slightest
predilection
left
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
attach
not
the
least
importance
to
any
opinions
.
 
<EOS>
The
result
of
the
varieties
of
boredom
I
have
undergone
,
is
a
conviction
(
unless
conviction
is
too
industrious
a
word
for
the
lazy
sentiment
I
entertain
on
the
subject
)
,
that
any
set
of
ideas
will
do
just
as
much
good
as
any
other
set
,
and
just
as
much
harm
as
any
other
set

There
's
an
English

charming
Italian
motto

It

going

<EOS>
This
vicious
assumption
of
honesty
in
dishonesty
---
a
vice
so
dangerous
,
so
deadly
,
and
so
common
---
<EOS>
seemed
,
he
observed
,
a
little
to
impress
her
in
his
favour
.
 
<EOS>
He
followed
up
the
advantage
,
by
saying
in
his
pleasantest
manner
:
 
a
manner
to
which
she
might
attach
as
much
or
as
little
meaning
as
she
pleased
:
 
<EOS>

The
side
that
can
prove
anything
in
a
line
of
units

tens

hundreds

thousands

Mrs
Bounderby

seems
to
me
to
afford
the
most
fun

to
give
a
man
the
best
chance

<EOS>
I
am
quite
as
much
attached

it

I
believed
it

I
am
quite
ready
to
go
in
for
it

to
the

extent
as
if
I
believed
it

And
what
more
could
I
possibly
do
,
if
I
did
believe
it

"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
singular
politician

said
Louisa
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
;
I
have
not
even
that
merit

<EOS>
We
are
the
largest
party
in
the
state

,
I
assure
you
,
<EOS>
Mrs
Bounderby
,
if
we
all
fell
out
of
our
adopted
ranks

were
reviewed
together

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
,
who
had
been
in
danger
of
bursting
in
silence
,
interposed
here
with
a
project
for
postponing
the
family
dinner
till
half
-
past
six
,
and
taking
Mr
James
Harthouse
in
the
meantime
on
a
round
of
visits
to
the
voting
and
interesting
notabilities
of
Coketown
and
its
vicinity
.
 
<EOS>
The
round
of
visits
was
made
;
and
Mr
James
Harthouse
,
with
a
discreet
use
of
his
blue
coaching
,
came
off
triumphantly
,
though
with
a
considerable
accession
of
boredom
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
evening
,
he
found
the
dinner
-
table
laid
for
four
,
but
they
sat
down
only
three
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
appropriate
occasion
for
Mr
Bounderby
to
discuss
the
flavour
of
the
hap'orth
of
stewed
eels
he
had
purchased
in
the
streets
at
eight
years
old
;
and
also
of
the
inferior
water
,
specially
used
for
laying
the
dust
,
with
which
he
had
washed
down
that
repast
.
 
<EOS>
He
likewise
entertained
his
guest
over
the
soup
and
fish
,
with
the
calculation
that
he
(
Bounderby
)
had
eaten
in
his
youth
at
least
three
horses
under
the
guise
of
polonies
and
saveloys
.
 
<EOS>
These
recitals
,
Jem
,
in
a
languid
manner
,
received
with
"
charming
!
"
<EOS>
every
now
and
then
;
and
they
probably
would
have
decided
him
to
"
go
in
"
for
Jerusalem
again
to
-
morrow
morning
,
<EOS>
had
he
been
less
curious
respecting
Louisa
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
nothing
,
"
he
thought
,
glancing
at
her
as
she
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
,
where
her
youthful
figure
,
small
and
slight
,
but
very
graceful
,
looked
as
pretty
as
it
looked
misplaced
;
"
is
there
nothing
that
will
move
that
face
?
"
   
<EOS>
Yes
!
 
<EOS>
By
Jupiter
,
there
was
something
,
and
here
it
was
,
in
an
unexpected
shape
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
She
changed
as
the
door
opened
,
and
broke
into
a
beaming
smile
.
   
<EOS>
A
beautiful
smile
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
James
Harthouse
might
not
have
thought
so
much
of
it
,
but
that
he
had
wondered
so
long
at
her
impassive
face
.
<EOS>
She
put
out
her
hand
---
a
pretty
little
soft
hand
;
and
her
fingers
closed
upon
her
brother
's
,
as
if
she
would
have
carried
them
to
her
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
?
<EOS>
"
thought
the
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
whelp
is
the
only
creature
she
cares
for
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
so
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
whelp
was
presented
,
and
took
his
chair
.
 
<EOS>
The
appellation
was
not
flattering
,
but
not
unmerited
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
was
your
age
,
young
Tom
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
"
I
was
punctual
,
or
I
got
no
dinner
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
you
were
my
age
,
"
resumed
Tom
,
"
you
had
n't
a
wrong
balance
to
get
right
,
and
had
n't
to
dress
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
that
now
,
"
said
Bounderby
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
"
grumbled
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
begin
with
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Bounderby
,
"
said
Harthouse
,
perfectly
hearing
this
under
-
strain
as
it
went
on
;
"
your
brother
's
face
is
quite
familiar
to
me
.
<EOS>
Can
I
have
seen
him
abroad
?
 
<EOS>
Or
at
some
public
school
,
perhaps
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
resumed
,
quite
interested
,
"
he
has
never
been
abroad
yet
,
and
was
educated
here
,
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
,
love
,
I
am
telling
Mr
Harthouse
that
he
never
saw
you
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
such
luck
,
sir
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
little
enough
in
him
to
brighten
her
face
,
for
he
was
a
sullen
young
fellow
,
and
ungracious
in
his
manner
even
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
So
much
the
greater
must
have
been
the
solitude
of
her
heart
,
and
her
need
of
some
one
on
whom
to
bestow
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
more
is
this
whelp
<EOS>
the
only
creature
she
has
ever
cared
for
,
"
thought
Mr
James
Harthouse
,
turning
it
over
and
over
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
more
.
 
<EOS>
So
much
the
more
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Both
in
his
sister
's
presence
,
and
after
she
had
left
the
room
,
the
whelp
took
no
pains
to
hide
his
contempt
for
Mr
Bounderby
,
whenever
he
could
indulge
it
without
the
observation
of
that
independent
man
,
by
making
wry
faces
,
or
shutting
one
eye
.
 
<EOS>
Without
responding
to
these
telegraphic
communications
,
Mr
Harthouse
encouraged
him
much
in
the
course
of
the
evening
,
and
showed
an
unusual
liking
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
when
he
rose
to
return
to
his
hotel
,
and
was
a
little
doubtful
whether
he
knew
the
way
by
night
,
the
whelp
immediately
proffered
his
services
as
guide
,
and
turned
out
with
him
to
escort
him
thither
.

Chapter

<EOS>
The
Whelp
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
remarkable
that
a
young
gentleman
who
had
been
brought
up
under
one
continuous
system
of
unnatural
restraint
,
should
be
a
hypocrite
;
but
it
was
certainly
the
case
with
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
strange
that
a
young
gentleman
who
had
never
been
left
to
his
own
guidance
for
five
consecutive
minutes
,
should
be
incapable
at
last
of
governing
himself
;
but
so
it
was
with
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
altogether
unaccountable
that
a
young
gentleman
whose
imagination
had
been
strangled
in
his
cradle
,
should
be
still
inconvenienced
by
its
ghost
in
the
form
of
grovelling
sensualities
;
but
such
a
monster
,
beyond
all
doubt
,
was
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
smoke
?
"
asked
Mr
James
Harthouse
,
when
they
came
to
the
hotel
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
!
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
He
could
do
no
less
than
ask
Tom
up
;
and
Tom
could
do
no
less
than
go
up

<EOS>
What
with
a
cooling
drink
adapted
to
the
weather
,
but
<EOS>
not
so
weak
as
cool
;
and
what
with
a
rarer
tobacco
than
was
to
be
bought
in
those
parts
;
Tom
was
soon
in
a
highly
free
and
easy
state
at
his
end
of
the
sofa
,
and
more
than
ever
disposed
to
admire
his
new
friend
at
the
other
end
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
blew
his
smoke
aside
,
after
he
had
been
smoking
a
little
while
,
and
took
an
observation
of
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
do
n't
seem
to
care
about
his
dress
,
"
thought
Tom
,
"
and
yet
how
capitally
he
does
it
.
<EOS>
What
an
easy
swell
he
is
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
James
Harthouse
,
happening
to
catch
Tom
's
eye
,
remarked
that
he
drank
nothing
,
and
filled
his
glass
with
his
own
negligent
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr
Harthouse
,
I
hope
you
have
had
about
a
dose
of
old
Bounderby
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Tom
said
this
with
one
eye
shut
up
again
,
and
looking
over
his
glass
knowingly
,
at
his
entertainer
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
very
good
fellow
indeed
!
"
returned
Mr
James
Harthouse
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
think
so
,
do
n't
you
?
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
And
shut
up
his
eye
again
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
James
Harthouse
smiled
;
and
rising
from
his
end
of
the
sofa
,
and
lounging
with
his
back
against
the
chimney
-
piece
,
so
that
he
stood
before
the
empty
fire
-
grate
as
he
smoked
,
in
front
of
Tom
and
looking
down
at
him
,
observed
:
   
"
What
a
comical
brother
-
in
-
law
you
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
comical
brother
-
in
-
law
old
Bounderby
is
,
I
think
you
mean
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
piece
of
caustic
,
Tom
,
"
retorted
Mr
James
Harthouse
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
something
so
very
agreeable
in
being
so
intimate
with
such
a
waistcoat
;
in
being
called
Tom
,
in
such
an
intimate
way
,
by
such
a
voice
;
in
being
on
such
off
-
hand
terms
so
soon
,
with
such
a
pair
of
whiskers
;
that
Tom
was
uncommonly
pleased
with
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
for
old
Bounderby
,
"
said
he
,
"
if
you
mean
that
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
called
old
Bounderby
by
the
same
name
when
I
have
talked
about
him
,
and
I
have
always
thought
of
him
in
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
going
to
begin
to
be
polite
now
,
about
old
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
rather
late
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Do
n't
mind
me
,
"
returned
James
;
"
but
take
care
when
his
wife
is
by
,
you
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
His
wife
?
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
sister
Loo
?
 
<EOS>
O
yes
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
laughed
,
and
took
a
little
more
of
the
cooling
drink
.
   
<EOS>
James
Harthouse
continued
to
lounge
in
the
same
place
and
attitude
,
smoking
his
cigar
in
his
own
easy
way
,
and
looking
pleasantly
at
the
whelp
,
as
if
he
knew
himself
to
be
a
kind
of
agreeable
demon
who
had
only
to
hover
over
him
,
and
he
must
give
up
his
whole
soul
if
required
.
 
<EOS>
It
certainly
did
seem
that
the
whelp
yielded
to
this
influence
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
at
his
companion
sneakingly
<EOS>
,
he
looked
at
him
admiringly
,
he
looked
at
him
boldly
,
and
put
up
one
leg
on
the
sofa
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
sister
Loo
?
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
never
cared
for
old
Bounderby
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
past
tense
,
Tom
,
"
returned
Mr
James
Harthouse
,
striking
the
ash
from
his
cigar
with
his
little
finger
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
in
the
present
tense
,
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Verb
neuter
,
not
to
care
.
 
<EOS>
Indicative
mood
,
present

.
 
<EOS>
First
person
singular
,
I
do
not
care
;
second
person
singular
,
thou
dost
not
care
;
third
person
singular
,
she
does
not
care
,
"
returned
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
!
 
<EOS>
Very
quaint
!
"
said
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
Though
you
do
n't
mean
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
mean
it
,
"
cried
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
honour
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
you
wo
n't
tell
me
,
Mr
Harthouse
,
that
you
really
suppose
my
sister
Loo
does
care
for
old
Bounderby
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
fellow
,
"
returned
the
other
,
"
what
am
I
bound
to
suppose
,
when
I
find
two
married
people
living
in
harmony
and
happiness
?
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
had
by
this
time
got
both
his
legs
on
the
sofa
.
 
<EOS>
If
his
second
leg
had
not
been
already
there
when
he
was
called
a
dear
fellow
,
he
would
have
put
it
up
at
that
great
stage
of
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
Feeling
it
necessary
to
do
something
then
,
he
stretched
himself
out
at
greater
length
,
and
,
reclining
with
the
back
of
his
head
on
the
end
of
the
sofa
,
and
smoking
with
an
infinite
assumption
of
negligence
,
turned
his
common
face
,
and
not
too
sober
eyes
,
towards
the
face
looking
down
upon
him
so
carelessly
yet
so
potently
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
our
governor
,
Mr
Harthouse
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
and
therefore
,
you
need
n't
be
surprised
that
Loo
married
old
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
had
a
lover
,
and
the
governor
proposed
old
Bounderby
,
and
she
took
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
dutiful
in
your
interesting
sister
,
"
said
Mr
James
Harthouse
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
she
would
n't
have
been
as
dutiful
,
and
it
would
not
have
come
off
as
easily
,
"
returned
the
whelp
,
"
if
it
had
n't
been
for
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
tempter
merely
lifted
his
eyebrows
;
but
the
whelp
was
obliged
to
go
on
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
persuaded
her
,
"
he
said
,
with
an
edifying
air
of
superiority
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
stuck
into
old
Bounderby
's
bank
(
where
I
never
wanted
to
be
)
,
and
I
knew
I
should
get
into
scrapes
there
,
if
she
put
old
<EOS>
Bounderby
's
pipe
out
;
so
I
told
her
my
wishes
,
and
she
came
into
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
do
anything
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
game
of
her
,
was
n't
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
charming
,
Tom
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
that
it
was
altogether
so
important
to
her
as
it
was
to
me
,
"
continued
Tom
coolly
,
"
because
my
liberty
and
comfort
,
and
perhaps
my
getting
on
,
depended
on
it
;
and
she
had
no
other
lover
,
and
staying
at
home
was
like
staying
in
jail
---
especially
when
I
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
n't
as
if
she
gave
up
another
lover
for
old
Bounderby
;
but
still
it
was
a
good
thing
in
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
delightful
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
gets
on
so
placidly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
"
returned
Tom
,
with
contemptuous
patronage
,
"
she
's
a
regular
girl
.
 
<EOS>
A
girl
can
get
on
anywhere
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
settled
down
to
the
life
,
and
she
do
n't
mind
.
 
<EOS>
It
does
just
as
well
as
another
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
though
Loo
is
a
girl
,
she
's
not
a
common
sort
of
girl
.
<EOS>
She
can
shut
herself
up
within
herself
,
and
think
---
as
I
have
often
known
her
sit
and
watch
the
fire
---
for
an
hour
at
a
stretch
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
?
 
<EOS>
Has
resources
of
her
own
,
"
said
Harthouse
,
smoking
quietly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
so
much
of
that
as
you
may
suppose
,
"
returned
Tom
;
"
for
our
governor
had
her
crammed
with
all
sorts
of
dry
bones
and
sawdust
.
<EOS>
It
's
his
system
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Formed
his
daughter
on
his
own
model
?
"
suggested
Harthouse
.
   
<EOS>
"
His
daughter
?
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
and
everybody
else
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
he
formed
Me
that
way
!
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Impossible
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
did
,
though
,
"
said
Tom
,
shaking
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
say
,
Mr
Harthouse
,
that
when
I
first
left
home
and
went
to
old
Bounderby
's
,
I
was
as
flat
as
a
warming
-
pan
,
and
knew
no
more
about
life
,
than
any
oyster
does
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Tom
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
believe
that
.
 
<EOS>
A
joke
's
a
joke
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
soul
!
"
said
the
whelp
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
serious
;
I
am
indeed
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
smoked
with
great
gravity
and
dignity
for
a
little
while
,
and
then
added
,
in
a
highly
complacent
tone
,
"
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
picked
up
a
little
since
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
deny
that
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
done
it
myself
;
no
thanks
to
the
governor
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
And
your
intelligent
sister
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
intelligent
sister
is
about
where
she
was
.
 
<EOS>
She
used
to
complain
to
me
that
she
had
nothing
to
fall
back
upon
,
that
girls
usually
fall
back
upon
;
and
I
do
n't
see
how
she
is
to
have
got
over
that
since
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
do
n't
mind
,
"
he
sagaciously
added
,
puffing
at
his
cigar
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Girls
can
always
get
on
,
somehow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Calling
at
the
Bank
yesterday
evening
,
for
Mr
Bounderby
's
address
,
I
found
an
ancient
lady
there
,
who
seems
to
entertain
great
admiration
for
your
sister
,
"
observed
Mr
James
Harthouse
,
throwing
away
the
last
small
remnant
of
the
cigar
he
had
now
smoked
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mother
Sparsit
!
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
you
have
seen
her
already
,
have
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
His
friend
nodded
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
took
his
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
,
to
shut
up
his
eye
(
which
had
grown
rather
unmanageable
)
with
the
greater
expression
,
and
to
tap
his
nose
several
times
with
his
finger
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mother
Sparsit
's
feeling
for
Loo
is
more
than
admiration
,
I
should
think
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Say
affection
and
devotion
.
 
<EOS>
Mother
Sparsit
never
set
her
cap
at
Bounderby
when
he
was
a
bachelor
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
These
were
the
last
words
spoken
by
the
whelp
,
before
a
giddy
drowsiness
came
upon
him
,
followed
by
complete
oblivion
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
roused
from
the
latter
state
by
an
uneasy
dream
of
being
stirred
up
with
a
boot
,
and
also
of
a
voice
saying
:
 
"
Come
,
it
's
late
.
 
<EOS>
Be
off
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
scrambling
from
the
sofa
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
take
my
leave
of
you
though
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
Yours
is
very
good
tobacco
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
's
too
mild
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
's
too
mild
,
"
returned
his
entertainer
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
---
<EOS>
it
's
ridiculously
mild
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
's
the
door
!
<EOS>
Good
night
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
had
another
odd
dream
of
being
taken
by
a
waiter
through
a
mist
,
which
,
after
giving
him
some
trouble
and
difficulty
,
resolved
itself
into
the
main
street
,
in
which
he
stood
alone
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
walked
home
pretty
easily
,
though
not
yet
free
from
an
impression
of
the
presence
and
influence
of
his
new
friend
---
as
if
he
were
lounging
somewhere
in
the
air
,
in
the
same
negligent
attitude
,
regarding
him
with
the
same
look
.
   
<EOS>
The
whelp
went
home
,
and
went
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
had
any
sense
of
what
he
had
done
that
night
,
and
had
been
less
of
a
whelp
and
more
of
a
brother
,
he
might
have
turned
short
on
the
road
,
might
have
gone
down
to
the
ill
-
smelling
river
that
was
dyed
black
,
<EOS>
might
have
gone
to
bed
in
it
for
good
and
all
,
and
have
curtained
his
head
for
ever
with
its
filthy
waters
.

was
as
hoarse
as
he
was
hot
.
 
<EOS>
By
dint
of
roaring
at
the
top
of
his
voice
under
a
flaring
gaslight
,
clenching
his
fists
,
knitting
his
brows
,
setting
his
teeth
,
and
pounding
with
his
arms
,
he
had
taken
so
much
out
of
himself
by
this
time
,
that
he
was
brought
to
a
stop
,
and
called
for
a
glass
of
water
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
stood
there
,
trying
to
quench
his
fiery
face
with
his
drink
of
water
,
the
comparison
between
the
orator
and
the
crowd
of
attentive
faces
turned
towards
him
,
was
extremely
to
his
disadvantage
.
 
<EOS>
Judging
him
by
Nature
's
evidence
,
he
was
above
the
mass
in
very
little
but
the
stage
on
which
he
stood
.
 
<EOS>
In
many
great
respects
he
was
essentially
below
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
so
honest
<EOS>
,
he
was
not
so
manly
,
he
was
not
so
good
-
humoured
;
he
substituted
cunning
for
their
simplicity
,
and
passion
for
their
safe
solid
sense
.
 
<EOS>
An
ill
-
made
,
high
-
shouldered
man
,
with
lowering
brows
,
and
his
features
crushed
into
an
habitually
sour
expression
,
he
contrasted
most
unfavourably
,
even
in
his
mongrel
dress
,
with
the
great
body
of
his
hearers
in
their
plain
working
clothes
.
 
<EOS>
Strange
as
it
always
is
to
consider
any
assembly
in
the
act
of
submissively
resigning
itself
to
the
dreariness
of
some
complacent
person
,
lord
or
commoner
,
whom
three
-
fourths
of
it
could
,
by
no
human
means
,
raise
out
of
the
slough
of
inanity
to
their
own
intellectual
level
,
it
was
particularly
strange
,
and
it
was
even
particularly
affecting
,
to
see
this
crowd
of
earnest
faces
,
whose
honesty
in
the
main
no
competent
observer
free
from
bias
could
doubt
,
so
agitated
by
such
a
leader
.
   
<EOS>
Good
!
 
<EOS>
Hear
,
hear
!
 
<EOS>
Hurrah
!
 
<EOS>
The
eagerness
both
of
attention
and
intention
,
exhibited
in
all
the
countenances
,
made
them
a
most
impressive
sight
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
carelessness
,
no
languor
,
no
idle
curiosity
;
none
of
the
many
shades
of
indifference
to
be
seen
in
all
other
assemblies
,
visible
for
one
moment
there
.
 
<EOS>
That
every
man
felt
his
condition
to
be
,
somehow
or
other
,
worse
than
it
might
be
;
that
every
man
considered
it
incumbent
on
him
to
join
the
rest
,
towards
the
making
of
it
better
;
that
every
man
felt
his
only
hope
to
be
in
his
allying
himself
to
the
comrades
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
;
and
that
in
this
belief
,
right
or
wrong
(
unhappily
wrong
then
)
,
the
whole
of
that
crowd
were
gravely
,
deeply
,
faithfully
in
earnest
;
must
have
been
as
plain
to
any
one
who
chose
to
see
what
was
there
,
as
the
bare
beams
of
the
roof
and
the
whitened
brick
walls
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
could
any
such
spectator
fail
to
know
in
his
own
breast
,
that
these
men
,
through
their
very
delusions
,
showed
great
qualities
,
susceptible
of
being
turned
to
the
happiest
and
best
account
;
and
that
to
pretend
(
on
the
strength
of
sweeping
axioms
,
howsoever
cut
and
dried
)
that
they
went
astray
wholly
without
cause
,
and
of
their
own
irrational
wills
,
was
to
pretend
that
there
could
be
smoke
without
fire
,
death
without
birth
,
harvest
without
seed
,
anything
or
everything
produced
from
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
The
orator
having
refreshed
himself
,
wiped
his
corrugated
forehead
from
left
to
right
several
times
with
his
handkerchief
folded
into
a
pad
,
and
concentrated
all
his
revived
forces
,
in
a
sneer
of
great
disdain
and
bitterness
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
oh
,
my
friends
and
brothers
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
men
and
Englishmen
,
the
down
-
trodden
operatives
of
Coketown
!
 
<EOS>
What
shall
we
say
of
that
man
---
that
working
-
man
,
that
I
should
find
it
necessary
so
to
libel
the
glorious
name
---
who
,
being
practically
and
well
acquainted
with
the
grievances
and
wrongs
of
you
,
the
injured
pith
and
marrow
of
this
land
,
and
having
heard
you
,
with
a
noble
and
majestic
unanimity
that
will
make
Tyrants
tremble
,
resolve
for
to
subscribe
to
the
funds
of
the
United
Aggregate
Tribunal
,
and
to
abide
by
the
injunctions
issued
by
that
body
for
your
benefit
,
whatever
they
may
be
<EOS>
---
what
,
I
ask
you
,
will
you
say
of
that
working
-
man
,
since
such
I
must
acknowledge
him
to
be
,
who
,
at
such
a
time
,
deserts
his
post
,
and
sells
his
flag
;
who
,
at
such
a
time
,
turns
a
traitor
and
a
craven
and
a
recreant
,
who
,
at
such
a
time
,
is
not
ashamed
to
make
to
you
the
dastardly
and
humiliating
avowal
that
he
will
hold
himself
aloof
,
and
will
not
be
one
of
those
associated
in
the
gallant
stand
for
Freedom
and
for
Right
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
assembly
was
divided
at
this
point
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
some
groans
and
hisses
,
but
the
general
sense
of
honour
was
much
too
strong
for
the
condemnation
of
a
man
unheard
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
sure
you
're
right
,
Slackbridge
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Put
him
up
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
's
hear
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
Such
things
were
said
on
many
sides
.
 
<EOS>
Finally
,
one
strong
voice
called
out
,
"
Is
the
man
heer
?
 
<EOS>
If
the
man
's
heer
,
Slackbridge
,
let
's
hear
the
man
himseln
,
"
stead
o
'
yo

"
 
<EOS>
Which
was
received
with
a
round
of
applause
.
   
<EOS>
Slackbridge
,
the
orator
,
looked
about
him
with
a
withering
smile
;
and
,
holding
out
his
right
hand
at
arm
's
length
(
as
the
manner
of
all
Slackbridges
is
)
,
to
still
the
thundering
sea
,
waited
until
there
was
a
profound
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
friends
and
fellow
-
men
!
"
said
Slackbridge
then
,
shaking
his
head
with
violent
scorn
,
"
I
do
not
wonder
that
you
,
the
prostrate
sons
of
labour
,
are
incredulous
of
the
existence
of
such
a
man
.
<EOS>
But
he
who
sold
his
birthright
for
a
mess
of
pottage
existed
,
and
Judas
Iscariot
existed
,
and
Castlereagh
existed
,
and
this
man
exists
!
"
   
<EOS>
Here
,
a
brief
press
and
confusion
near
the
stage
,
ended
in
the
man
himself
standing
at
the
orator
's
side
before
the
concourse
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
pale
and
a
little
moved
in
the
face
<EOS>
---
his
lips
especially
showed
it
;
but
he
stood
quiet
,
with
his
left
hand
at
his
chin
,
waiting
to
be
heard
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
chairman
to
regulate
the
proceedings
,
and
this
functionary
now
took
the
case
into
his
own
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
friends
,
"
said
he
,
"
by
<EOS>
virtue

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
,
the
chairman
shook
him
frankly
by
the
hand
,
and
sat
down
again
.
 
<EOS>
Slackbridge
likewise
sat
down
,
wiping
his
hot
forehead
---
always
from
left
to
right
,
and
never
the
reverse
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
friends
,
"
Stephen
began
,
in
the
midst
of
a
dead
calm
;
"
I

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Slackbridge
shook
his
head
as
if
he
would
shake
it
off
,
in
his
bitterness
.
   
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
Slackbridge
laughed
,
folded
his
arms
,
and
frowned
sarcastically
.
   
<EOS>
"
But

"
   
<EOS>
Slackbridge
jumped
up
and
stood
beside
him
,
gnashing
and
tearing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
friends
,
what
but
<EOS>
this
did
I
tell
you
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
fellow
-
countrymen
,
what
warning
but
<EOS>
this
did
I
give
you
?
 
<EOS>
And
how
shows
this
recreant
conduct
in
a
man
on
whom
unequal
laws
are
known
to
have
fallen
heavy
?
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
Englishmen
,
I
ask
you
how
does
this
subornation
show
in
one
of
yourselves
,
who
is
thus
consenting
to
his
own
undoing
and
to
yours
,
and
to
your
children
's
and
your
children
's
children
's
?
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
some
applause
,
and
some
crying
of
Shame
upon
the
man
;
but
the
greater
part
of
the
audience
were
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
They
looked
at
Stephen
's
worn
face
,
rendered
more
pathetic
by
the
homely
emotions
it
evinced
;
and
,
in
the
kindness
of
their
nature
,
they
were
more
sorry
than
indignant
.
   
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
this
Delegate
's
trade
for

said
Stephen
,
"

<EOS>
That

"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
propriety
,
not
to
say
a
dignity
in
these
words
,
that
made
the
hearers
yet
more
quiet
and
attentive
.
 
<EOS>
The
same
strong
voice
called
out
,
"
Slackbridge
,
let
the

and

<EOS>
Then
the
place
was
wonderfully
still

Stephen

whose
low

was
distinctly
heard

<EOS>
There
was
an
universal
murmur
to
the
same
effect
,
though
no
man
articulated
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
Every
eye
was
fixed
on
Stephen
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
To
repent
of
his
determination
,
would
be
to
take
a
load
from
all
their
minds
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
around
him
,
and
knew
that
it
was
so
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
grain
of
anger
with
them
was
in
his
heart
;
he
knew
them
,
far
below
their
surface
weaknesses
and
misconceptions
,
as
no
one
but
their
fellow
-
labourer
could
.
   
<EOS>

<EOS>
He
made
a
sort
of
reverence
to
them
by
holding
up
his
arms
,
and
stood
for
the
moment
in
that
attitude
;
not
speaking
until
they
slowly
dropped
at
his
sides
.
   
<EOS>
"

easier

He
had
moved
away
a
pace
or
two
to
come
down
from
the
platform
,
when
he
remembered
something
he
had
not
said
,
and
returned
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Haply

he
said
,
turning
his
furrowed
face
slowly
about
,
that
he
might
as
it
were
individually
address
the
whole
audience

near

<EOS>
If

is
any

my

I

tis
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
Not
a
word
was
spoken
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
sound
was
audible
in
the
building
,
but
the
slight
rustle
of
men
moving
a
little
apart
,
all
along
the
centre
of
the
room
,
to
open
a
means
of
passing
out
,
to
the
man
with
whom
they
had
all
bound
themselves
to
renounce
companionship
.
<EOS>
Looking
at
no
one
,
and
going
his
way
with
a
lowly
steadiness
upon
him
that
asserted
nothing
and
sought
nothing
,
Old
Stephen
,
with
all
his
troubles
on
his
head
,
left
the
scene
.
   
<EOS>
Then
Slackbridge
,
who
had
kept
his
oratorical
arm
extended
during
the
going
out
,
as
if
he
were
repressing
with
infinite
solicitude
and
by
a
wonderful
moral
power
<EOS>
the
vehement
passions
of
the
multitude
,
applied
himself
to
raising
their
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
Had
not
the
Roman
Brutus
,
oh
,
<EOS>
my
British
countrymen
,
condemned
his
son
to
death
;
and
had
not
the
Spartan
mothers
,
oh
my
soon
to
be
victorious
friends
,
driven
their
flying
children
on
the
points
of
their
enemies
'
swords
?
 
<EOS>
Then
was
it
not
the
sacred
duty
of
the
men
of
Coketown
,
with
forefathers
before
them
,
an
admiring
world
in
company
with
them
,
and
a
posterity
to
come
after
them
,
to
hurl
out
traitors
from
the
tents
they
had
pitched
in
a
sacred
and
a
God
-
like
cause
?
 
<EOS>
The
winds
of
heaven
answered
<EOS>
Yes
;
and
bore
<EOS>
Yes
,
east
,
west
,
north
,
and
south
.
 
<EOS>
And
consequently
three
cheers
for
the
United
Aggregate
Tribunal
!
   
<EOS>
Slackbridge
acted
as
fugleman
,
and
gave
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
multitude
of
doubtful
faces
(
a
little
conscience
-
stricken
)
brightened
at
the
sound
,
and
took
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
Private
feeling
must
yield
to
the
common
cause
.
 
<EOS>
Hurrah
!
 
<EOS>
The
roof
yet
vibrated
with
the
cheering
,
when
the
assembly
dispersed
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
easily
did
Stephen
Blackpool
fall
into
the
loneliest
of
lives
,
the
life
of
solitude
among
a
familiar
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
The
stranger
in
the
land
who
looks
into
ten
thousand
faces
for
some
answering
look
and
never
finds
it
,
is
in
cheering
society
as
compared
with
him
who
passes
ten
averted
faces
daily
,
that
were
once
the
countenances
of
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Such
experience
was
to
be
Stephen
's
now
,
in
every
waking
moment
of
his
life
;
at
his
work
,
on
his
way
to
it
and
from
it
,
at
his
door
,
at
his
window
,
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
By
general
consent
,
they
even
avoided
that
side
of
the
street
on
which
he
habitually
walked
;
and
left
it
,
of
all
the
working
men
,
to
him
only
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
been
for
many
years
,
a
quiet
silent
man
,
associating
but
little
with
other
men
,
and
used
to
companionship
with
his
own
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
never
known
before
the
strength
of
the
want
in
his
heart
for
the
frequent
recognition
of
a
nod
,
a
look
,
a
word
;
or
the
immense
amount
of
relief
that
had
been
poured
into
it
by
drops
through
such
small
means
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
even
harder
than
he
could
have
believed
possible
,
to
separate
in
his
own
conscience
his
abandonment
by
all
his
fellows
from
a
baseless
sense
of
shame
and
disgrace
.
   
<EOS>
The
first
four
days
of
his
endurance
were
days
so
long
and
heavy
,
that
he
began
to
be
appalled
by
the
prospect
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
Not
only
did
he
see
no
Rachael
all
the
time
,
but
he
avoided
every
chance
of
seeing
her
;
for
,
<EOS>
although
he
knew
that
the
prohibition
did
not
yet
formally
extend
to
the
women
working
in
the
factories
,
he
found
that
some
of
them
with
whom
he
was
acquainted
were
changed
to
him
,
and
he
feared
to
try
others
,
and
dreaded
that
Rachael
might
be
even
singled
out
from
the
rest
if
she
were
seen
in
his
company
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
he
had
been
quite
alone
during
the
four
days
,
and
had
spoken
to
no
one
,
when
,
as
he
was
leaving
his
work
at
night
,
a
young
man
of
a
very
light
complexion
accosted
him
in
the
street
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
name
's
Blackpool
,
ai
n't
it
?
"
said
the
young
man
.
   
<EOS>
Stephen
coloured
to
find
himself
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
in
his
gratitude
for
being
spoken
to
,
or
in
the
suddenness
of
it
,
or
both
.
<EOS>
He
made
a
feint
of
adjusting
the
lining
,
and
said
,
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
Hand
they
have
sent
to
Coventry
,
I
mean
?
"
said
Bitzer
,
the
very
light
young
man
in
question
.
   
<EOS>
Stephen
answered
"
Yes
,
"
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
supposed
so
,
from
their
all
appearing
to
keep
away
from
you
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
wants
to
speak
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
his
house
,
do
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Stephen
said
"
Yes
,
"
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
go
straight
up
there
,
will
you
?
"
said
Bitzer
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
expected
,
and
have
only
to
tell
the
servant
it
's
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
belong
to
the
Bank
;
so
,
if
you
go
straight
up
without
me
(
I
was
sent
to
fetch
you
)
,
you
'll
save
me
a
walk
.
"
   
<EOS>
Stephen
,
whose
way
had
been
in
the
contrary
direction
,
turned
about
,
and
betook
himself
as
in
duty
bound
,
to
the
red
brick
castle
of
the
giant
Bounderby
.

<EOS>
Men
and
Masters
 
"
<EOS>
well
,
Stephen
,
"
said
<EOS>
Bounderby
,
in
his
windy
manner
,
"
what
's
this
I
hear
?
 
<EOS>
What
have
these
pests
of
the
earth
been
doing
to
you
?
<EOS>
Come
in
,
and
speak
up
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
into
the
drawing
-
room
that
he
was
thus
bidden
.
 
<EOS>
A
tea
-
table
was
set
out
;
and
Mr
Bounderby
's
young
wife
,
and
her
brother
,
and
a
great
gentleman
from
London
,
were
present
.
 
<EOS>
To
whom
Stephen
made
his
obeisance
,
closing
the
door
and
standing
near
it
,
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
man
I
was
telling
you
about
,
Harthouse
,
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentleman
he
addressed
,
who
was
talking
to
Mrs
Bounderby
on
the
sofa
,
got
up
,
saying
in
an
indolent
way
,
"
Oh
really
?
"
and
dawdled
to
the
hearthrug
where
Mr
Bounderby
stood
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
"
speak
up
!
"
   
<EOS>
After
the
four
days
he
had
passed
,
this
address
fell
rudely
and
discordantly
on
Stephen
's
ear
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
being
a
rough
handling
of
his
wounded
mind
,
it
seemed
to
assume
that
he
really
was
the
self
-
interested
deserter
he
had
been
called
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
were
it
,
sir
,
"
said
Stephen
,
"
as
yo
were
pleased
to
want
wi
'
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
have
told
you
,
"
returned
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
Speak
up
like
a
man
,
since
you
are
a
man
,
and
tell
us
about
yourself
and
this
Combination
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wi
'
yor
pardon
,
sir
,
"
said
Stephen
Blackpool
,
"
I
ha
'
nowt
to
sen
about
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
,
who
was
always
more
or
less
like
a
Wind
,
finding
something
in
his
way
here
,
began
to
blow
at
it
directly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
look
here
,
Harthouse
,
"
said
he
,
"
here
's
a
specimen
of
'em
.
<EOS>
When
this
man
was
here
once
before
,
I
warned
this
man
against
the
mischievous
strangers
who
are
always
about
---
and
who
ought
to
be
hanged
wherever
they
are
found
---
and
I
told
this
man
that
he
was
going
in
the
wrong
direction
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
would
you
believe
it
,
that
although
they
have
put
this
mark
upon
him
,
he
is
such
a
slave
to
them
still
,
that
he
's
afraid
to
open
his
lips
about
them
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
sed
as
I
had
nowt
to

sir

not
as
I
was
fearfo

my
lips

"
   
<EOS>
"
You
said
!
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
you
said
;
more
than
that
,
I
know
what
you
mean
,
you
see
.
 
<EOS>
Not
always
the
same
thing
,
by
the
Lord
Harry
!
<EOS>
Quite
different
things
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
better
tell
us
at
once
,
that
that
fellow
Slackbridge
is
not
in
the
town
,
stirring
up
the
people
to
mutiny
;
and
that
he
is
not
a
regular
qualified
leader
of
the
people
:
 
that
is
,
a
most
confounded
scoundrel
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
better
tell
us
so
at
once
;
you
ca
n't
deceive
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
want
to
tell
us
so
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
as
sooary
as
yo
,
sir
,
when
the
people
's
leaders
is
bad

said
Stephen
,
shaking
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
They

<EOS>
The
wind
began
to
get
boisterous
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
you
'll
think
this
pretty
well

said
Mr

<EOS>
"
You

You

what
my

springing

How

said
Mr
Bounderby

with
his
thumbs
in
the
arms

his

and
jerking
his
head
and
shutting
his

(

<EOS>

"
<EOS>
As
for

had
just
nothing
at
all
to

said
Bounderby
,
still
in
confidence
with
the
wall
.
<EOS>
"
If
only
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
had
been
in
question

you
would
have
joined

made
no

about
it

<EOS>
"
Why
yes

<EOS>
'
Tis
true

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Though

"
said
Mr
Bounderby
,
now
blowing
a
gale
,
"
that
there
are
a
set
of
rascals
and
rebels
whom
transportation
is
too
good
for

<EOS>
Now
,
Mr
Harthouse
,
you
have
been
knocking
about
in
the
world
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
meet
with
anything
like
that
man
out
of
this
blessed
country
?
"
 
<EOS>
And
Mr
Bounderby
pointed
him
out
for
inspection
,
with
an
angry
finger
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Stephen
Blackpool
,
staunchly
protesting
against
the
words
that
had
been
used
,
and
instinctively
addressing
himself
to
Louisa
,
after
glancing
at
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not

rascals

<EOS>
He
spoke
with
the
rugged
earnestness
of
his
place
and
character
---
deepened
perhaps
by
a
proud
consciousness
that
he
was
faithful
to
his
class
under
all
their
mistrust
;
but
he
fully
remembered
where
he
was

did
not

raise

In

said
Mr

,
<EOS>
"
it
's
because

How
'
tis
,
ma'am

"
resumed
Stephen
,
appearing
still
to
find
his
natural
refuge
in
Louisa
's
face
,
"
that
what
is
best
in

seems
to
turn

most

<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
friend
,
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
,
whom
he
could
not
have
exasperated
more
,
quite
unconscious
of
it
though
he
was
,
than
by
seeming
to
appeal
to
any
one
else
,
"
if
you
will
favour
me
with
your
attention
for
half
a
minute
,
I
should
like
to
have
a
word

two
with
you

<EOS>
You
said
just
now
,
that
you
had
nothing
to
tell
us
about
this
business

<EOS>
You
are
quite
sure
of
that
before

go
any
further

<EOS>
"
Sir

I
am
sure
on
'
t.
"
   
"
Here
's
a
gentleman
from
London
present
,
"
Mr
Bounderby
made
a
backhanded
point
at
Mr
James
Harthouse
with
his
thumb
,
"
a
Parliament
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
him
to
hear
a
short
bit
of
dialogue
between
you
and
me
,
instead
of
taking
the
substance
of
it
---
<EOS>
for
I
know
precious
well
,
beforehand
,
what
it
will
be
;
nobody
knows
better
than
I
do

take
notice

instead

receiving
it
on
trust
from
my
mouth

"
   
<EOS>
Stephen
bent
his
head
to
the
gentleman
from
London
,
and
showed
a
rather
more
troubled
mind
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
his
eyes
involuntarily
to
his
former
refuge
,
but
at
a
look
from
that
quarter
(
expressive
though
instantaneous
)
<EOS>
he
settled
them
on
Mr
Bounderby
's
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
what
do
you
complain
of
?
"
asked
Mr
Bounderby
.
   
<EOS>
"
I

not

Stephen
reminded
him
,

repeated
Mr

,
folding
his
arms
,
"
do
you

,
in

way

complain
of

"
   
<EOS>
Stephen
looked
at
him
with
some
little
irresolution
for
a
moment
,
and
then
seemed
to
make
up
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
"

Reverting
for
a
moment
to
his
former
refuge
,
he
observed
a
cautionary
movement
of
her
eyes
towards
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Stepping
back
,
he
put
his
hand
upon
the
lock

<EOS>
But
he
had
not
spoken
out
of
his
own
will
and
desire

and
he
felt
it
in
his
heart
a
noble
return
for
his
late
injurious
treatment
to
be
faithful
to
the
last
to
those
who
had
repudiated

He

Stephen
stood
with
the
open

in

waiting
to
know

anything
more
were
expected

excessively
red
in

shook
his

mutely
protesting
that
indeed
he
had
other
business
to
do
for
his

"
You

Stephen
glanced
at
Louisa
again
,
but
her
eyes
were
raised
to
his
no
more
;
therefore
,
with
a
sigh
,
and
saying
,
barely
above
his
breath
,
"

Fading
Away
 
<EOS>
It
was
falling
dark
when
Stephen
came
out
of
Mr
Bounderby
's
house
.
<EOS>
The
shadows
of
night
had
gathered
so
fast
,
that
he
did
not
look
about
him
when
he
closed
the
door
,
but
plodded
straight
along
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
was
further
from
his
thoughts
than
the
curious
old
woman
he
had
encountered
on
his
previous
visit
to
the
same
house
,
when
he
heard
a
step
behind
him
that
he
knew
,
and
turning
,
saw
her
in
Rachael
's
company
.
   
<EOS>
He
saw
Rachael
first
,
as
he
had
heard
her
only
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah

Rachael
,
my
dear

<EOS>
Missus

"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
and
now
you
are
surprised
to
be
sure
,
and
with
reason
I
must
say
,
"
the
old
woman
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
I
am
again
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
how
wi
'
Rachael
?
"
said
Stephen
,
falling
into
their
step
,
walking
between
them
,
and
looking
from
the
one
to
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
come
to
be
with
this
good
lass
pretty
much
as
I
came
to
be
with
you
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
cheerfully
,
taking
the
reply
upon
herself
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
visiting
time
is
later
this
year
than
usual
,
for
I
have
been
rather
troubled
with
shortness
of
breath
,
and
so
put
it
off
till
the
weather
was
fine
and
warm
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
same
reason
I
do
n't
make
all
my
journey
in
one
day
,
but
divide
it
into
two
days
,
and
get
a
bed
to
-
night
at
the
Travellers
'
Coffee
House
down
by
the
railroad
(
a
nice
clean
house
)
,
and
go
back
Parliamentary
,
at
six
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
but
what
has
this
to
do
with
this
good
lass
,
says
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
'm
going
to
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
heard
of
Mr
Bounderby
being
married
.
 
<EOS>
I
read
it
in
the
paper
,
where
it
looked
grand
---
<EOS>
oh
,
it
looked
fine
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
old
woman
dwelt
on
it
with
strange
enthusiasm
:
"
and
I
want
to
see
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
seen
her
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
if
you
'll
believe
me
,
she
has
n't
come
out
of
that
house
since
noon
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
So
not
to
give
her
up
too
easily
,
I
was
waiting
about
,
a
little
last
bit
more
,
when
I
passed
close
to
this
good
lass
two
or
three
times
;
and
her
face
being
so
friendly
<EOS>
I
spoke
to
her
,
and
she
spoke
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
There
<EOS>
!
"
said
the
old
woman
to
Stephen
,
"
you
can
make
all
the
rest
out
for
yourself
now
,
a
deal
shorter
than
I
can
,
I
dare
say
!
"
   
<EOS>
Once
again
,
Stephen
had
to
conquer
an
instinctive
propensity
to
dislike
this
old
woman
,
though
her
manner
was
as
honest
and
simple
as
a
manner
possibly
could
be
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
gentleness
that
was
as
natural
to
him
as
he
knew
it
to
be
to
Rachael
,
he
pursued
the
subject
that
interested
her
in
her
old
age
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
missus
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
ha
seen
the
lady
,
and
she
were
young
and
hansom
.
 
<EOS>
Wi
'
fine
dark
thinkin
eyes
,
and
a
still
way
,
Rachael
,
as
I
ha
never
seen
the
like
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Young
and
handsome
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
!
"
cried
the
old
woman
,
quite
delighted
.
"
<EOS>
As
bonny
as
a
rose
!
 
<EOS>
And
what
a
happy
wife
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
missus
,
I
suppose
she
be
,
"
said
Stephen
.
 
<EOS>
But
with
a
doubtful
glance
at
Rachael
.
   
<EOS>
"
Suppose
she
be
?
 
<EOS>
She
must
be
.
 
<EOS>
She
's
your
master
's
wife
,
"
returned
the
old
woman
.
   
<EOS>
Stephen
nodded
assent
.
 
<EOS>
"
Though
as
to
master
,
"
said
he
,
glancing
again
at
Rachael
,
"
not
master
onny
more
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
aw
enden
'
twixt
him
and
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
left
his
work
,
Stephen
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Rachael
,
anxiously
and
quickly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Rachael
,
"
he
replied
,
"
whether
I
ha
lef'n
his
work
,
or
whether
his
work
ha
lef'n
me
,
cooms
t
'
th
'
same
.
 
<EOS>
His
work
and
me
are
parted
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tis
<EOS>
as
weel
<EOS>
so
---
better
,
I
were
thinkin
when
yo
coom
up
wi
'
me
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
ha
brought'n
trouble
upon
trouble
if
I
had
stayed
theer
.
 
<EOS>
Haply
'
tis
a
kindness
to
monny
that
I
go
;
haply
'
tis
a
kindness
to
myseln
;
anyways
it
mun
be
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
mun
turn
my
face
<EOS>
fro
Coketown
<EOS>
fur
th
'
time
,
and
seek
a
fort'n
,
dear
,
by
beginnin
fresh
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
will
you
go
,
Stephen
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
donno
t'night
,
"
said
he
,
lifting
off
his
hat
,
and
smoothing
his
thin
hair
with
the
flat
of
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
'm
not
goin
t'night
,
Rachael
,
nor
yet
t'morrow
.
 
<EOS>
'
Tan't
easy
overmuch
t
'
know
wheer
t
'
turn
,
but
a
good
heart
will
coom
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Herein
,
too
,
the
sense
of
even
thinking
unselfishly
aided
him
.
<EOS>
Before
he
had
so
much
as
closed
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
's
door
,
he
had
reflected
that
at
least
his
being
obliged
to
go
away
was
good
for
her
,
as
it
would
save
her
from
the
chance
of
being
brought
into
question
for
not
withdrawing
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
Though
it
would
cost
him
a
hard
pang
to
leave
her
,
and
though
he
could
think
of
no
similar
place
in
which
his
condemnation
would
not
pursue
him
,
perhaps
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
be
forced
away
from
the
endurance
of
the
last
four
days
,
even
to
unknown
difficulties
and
distresses
.
   
<EOS>
So
he
said
,
with
truth
,
"
I
'm
more
leetsome
,
Rachael
,
under
'
t
,
than
I
could'n
ha
believed
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
her
part
to
make
his
burden
heavier
.
 
<EOS>
She
answered
with
her
comforting
smile
,
and
the
three
walked
on
together
.
   
<EOS>
Age
,
especially
when
it
strives
to
be
self
-
reliant
and
cheerful
,
finds
much
consideration
among
the
poor
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
woman
was
so
decent
and
contented
,
and
made
so
light
of
her
infirmities
,
though
they
had
increased
upon
her
since
her
former
interview
with
Stephen
,
that
they
both
took
an
interest
in
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
too
sprightly
to
allow
of
their
walking
at
a
slow
pace
on
her
account
,
but
she
was
very
grateful
to
be
talked
to
,
and
very
willing
to
talk
to
any
extent
:
 
<EOS>
so
,
when
they
came
to
their
part
of
the
town
,
she
was
more
brisk
and
vivacious
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
to
my
poor
place
,
missus
,
"
said
Stephen
,
"
and
tak
a
coop
o
'
tea
.
 
<EOS>
Rachael
will
coom
then
;
and
arterwards
I
'll
see
thee
safe
t
'
thy
Travellers
'
lodgin
.
 
<EOS>
'
T
may
be
long
,
Rachael
,
ere
ever
<EOS>
I
ha
th
'
chance
o
'
thy
coompany
agen
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
complied
,
and
the
three
went
on
to
the
house
where
he
lodged
.
<EOS>
When
they
turned
into
a
narrow
street
,
Stephen
glanced
at
his
window
with
a
dread
that
always
haunted
his
desolate
home
;
but
it
was
open
,
as
he
had
left
it
,
and
no
one
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
evil
spirit
of
his
life
had
flitted
away
again
,
months
ago
,
and
he
had
heard
no
more
of
her
since
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
evidence
of
her
last
return
now
,
were
the
scantier
moveables
in
his
room
,
and
the
grayer
hair
upon
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
He
lighted
a
candle
,
set
out
his
little
tea
-
board
,
got
hot
water
from
below
,
and
brought
in
small
portions
of
tea
and
sugar
,
a
loaf
,
and
some
butter
from
the
nearest
shop
.
 
<EOS>
The
bread
was
new
and
crusty
,
the
butter
fresh
,
and
the
sugar
lump
,
of
course
---
in
fulfilment
of
the
standard
testimony
of
the
Coketown
magnates
,
that
these
people
lived
like
princes
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Rachael
made
the
tea
(
so
large
a
party
necessitated
the
borrowing
of
a
cup
)
,
and
the
visitor
enjoyed
it
mightily
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
glimpse
of
sociality
the
host
had
had
for
many
days
.
 
<EOS>
He
too
,
with
the
world
a
wide
heath
before
him
,
enjoyed
the
meal
---
again
in
corroboration
of
the
magnates
,
as
exemplifying
the
utter
want
of
calculation
on
the
part
of
these
people
,
sir
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ha
never
thowt
yet
,
missus
,
"
said
Stephen
,
"
o
'
askin
thy
name
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
lady
announced
herself
as
"
Mrs
Pegler
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
widder
,
I
think
?
"
said
Stephen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
many
long
years
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Pegler
's
husband
(
one
of
the
best
on
record
)
was
already
dead
,
by
Mrs
Pegler
's
calculation
,
when
Stephen
was
born
.
   
<EOS>
"
'
Twere
a
bad
job
,
too
,
to
lose
so
good
a
one
,
"
said
Stephen
.
<EOS>
"
Onny
children
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Pegler
's
cup
,
rattling
against
her
saucer
as
she
held
it
,
denoted
some
nervousness
on
her
part
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
now
,
not
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dead
,
Stephen
,
"
Rachael
softly
hinted
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sooary
<EOS>
I
ha
<EOS>
spok'n
on
'
t
,
"
said
Stephen
,
"
I
ought
t
'
hadn
in
my
mind
as
I
might
touch
a
sore
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
blame
myseln
.
"
   
<EOS>
While
he
excused
himself
,
the
old
lady
's
cup
rattled
more
and
more
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
a
son
,
"
she
said
,
curiously
distressed
,
and
not
by
any
of
the
usual
appearances
of
sorrow
;
"
and
<EOS>
he
did
well
,
wonderfully
well
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
is
not
to
be
spoken
of
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
---
"
Putting
down
her
cup
,
she
moved
her
hands
as
if
she
would
have
added
,
by
her
action
,
"
dead
!
"
 
<EOS>
Then
she
said
aloud
,
"
I
have
lost
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Stephen
had
not
yet
got
the
better
of
his
having
given
the
old
lady
pain
,
when
his
landlady
came
stumbling
up
the
narrow
stairs
,
and
calling
him
to
the
door
,
whispered
in
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Pegler
was
by
no
means
deaf
,
for
she
caught
a
word
as
it
was
uttered
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bounderby
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
in
a
suppressed
voice
,
starting
up
from
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
hide
me
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
me
be
seen
for
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
him
come
up
till
I
've
got
away
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
pray
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
trembled
,
and
was
excessively
agitated
;
getting
behind
Rachael
,
when
Rachael
tried
to
reassure
her
;
and
not
seeming
to
know
what
she
was
about
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
hearken
,
missus
,
hearken
,
"
said
Stephen
,
astonished
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tisn't
Mr
Bounderby
;
'
tis
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
Yo'r
<EOS>
not
fearfo
'
o
'
her
.
 
<EOS>
Yo
was
hey
-
go
-
mad
about
her
,
but
an
hour
sin
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
are
you
sure
it
's
the
lady
,
and
not
the
gentleman
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
still
trembling
.
   
<EOS>
"
Certain
sure
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
then
,
pray
do
n't
speak
to
me
,
nor
yet
take
any
notice
of
me
,
"
said
the
old
woman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
be
quite
to
myself
in
this
corner
.
"
   
<EOS>
Stephen
nodded
;
looking
to
Rachael
for
an
explanation
,
which
she
was
quite
unable
to
give
him
;
took
the
candle
,
went
downstairs
,
and
in
a
few
moments
returned
,
lighting
Louisa
into
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
followed
by
the
whelp
.
   
<EOS>
Rachael
had
risen
,
and
stood
apart
with
her
shawl
and
bonnet
in
her
hand
,
when
Stephen
,
himself
profoundly
astonished
by
this
visit
,
put
the
candle
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
too
stood
,
with
his
doubled
hand
upon
the
table
near
it
,
waiting
to
be
addressed
.
   
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
in
her
life
Louisa
had
come
into
one
of
the
dwellings
of
the
Coketown
Hands
;
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
face
to
face
with
anything
like
individuality
in
connection
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
knew
of
their
existence
by
hundreds
and
by
thousands
.
 
<EOS>
She
knew
what
results
in
work
a
given
number
of
them
would
produce
in
a
given
space
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
She
knew
them
in
crowds
passing
to
and
from
their
nests
,
like
ants
or
beetles
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
knew
from
her
reading
infinitely
more
of
the
ways
of
toiling
insects
than
of
these
toiling
men
and
women
.
   
<EOS>
Something
to
be
worked
so
much
and
paid
so
much
,
and
there
ended
;
something
to
be
infallibly
settled
by
laws
of
supply
and
demand
;
something
that
blundered
against
those
laws
,
and
floundered
into
difficulty
<EOS>
;
something
that
was
a
little
pinched
when
wheat
was
dear
,
and
over
-
ate
itself
when
wheat
was
cheap
;
something
that
increased
at
such
a
rate
of
percentage
,
and
yielded
such
another
percentage
of
crime
,
and
such
another
percentage
of
pauperism
;
something
wholesale
,
of
which
vast
fortunes
were
made
;
something
that
occasionally
rose
like
a
sea
,
and
did
some
harm
and
waste
(
chiefly
to
itself
)
,
and
fell
again
;
this
she
knew
the
Coketown
Hands
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
she
had
scarcely
thought
more
of
separating
them
into
units
,
than
of
separating
the
sea
itself
into
its
component
drops
.
   
<EOS>
She
stood
for
some
moments
looking
round
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
few
chairs
,
the
few
books
,
the
common
prints
,
and
the
bed
,
she
glanced
to
the
two
women
,
and
to
Stephen
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
to
speak
to
you
,
in
consequence
of
what
passed
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
be
serviceable
to
you
,
if
you
will
let
me
.
<EOS>
Is
this
your
wife
?
"
   
<EOS>
Rachael
raised
her
eyes
,
and
they
sufficiently
answered
no
,
and
dropped
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
remember
,
"
said
Louisa
,
reddening
at
her
mistake
;
"
I
recollect
,
now
,
to
have
heard
your
domestic
misfortunes
spoken
of
,
though
I
was
not
attending
to
the
particulars
at
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
my
meaning
to
ask
a
question
that
would
give
pain
to
any
one
here
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
should
ask
any
other
question
that
may
happen
to
have
that
result
,
give
me
credit
,
if
you
please
,
for
being
in
ignorance
how
to
speak
to
you
as
I
ought
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
Stephen
had
but
a
little
while
ago
instinctively
addressed
himself
to
her
,
so
she
now
instinctively
addressed
herself
to
Rachael
.
 
<EOS>
Her
manner
was
short
and
abrupt
,
yet
faltering
and
timid
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
told
you
what
has
passed
between
himself
and
my
husband
?
<EOS>
You
would
be
his
first
resource
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
the
end
of
it
,
young
lady
,
"
said
Rachael
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
I
understand
,
that
,
being
rejected
by
one
employer
,
he
would
probably
be
rejected
by
all
?
 
<EOS>
I
thought
he
said
as
much
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
chances
are
very
small
,
young
lady
---
next
to
nothing
---
for
a
man
who
gets
a
bad
name
among
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
shall
I
understand
that
you
mean
by
a
bad
name
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
name
of
being
troublesome
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
by
the
prejudices
of
his
own
class
,
and
by
the
prejudices
of
the
other
,
he
is
sacrificed
alike
?
 
<EOS>
Are
the
two
so
deeply
separated
in
this
town
,
that
there
is
no
place
whatever
for
an
honest
workman
between
them
?
"
   
<EOS>
Rachael
shook
her
head
in
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
fell
into
suspicion
,
"
said
Louisa
,
"
with
his
fellow
-
weavers
,
because
---
he
had
made
a
promise
not
to
be
one
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
must
have
been
to
you
that
he
made
that
promise
.
 
<EOS>
Might
I
ask
you
why
he
made
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
Rachael
burst
into
tears
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
seek
it
of
him
,
poor
lad
.
 
<EOS>
I
prayed
him
to
avoid
trouble
for
his
own
good
,
<EOS>
little
thinking
he
'd
come
to
it
through
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
know
he
'd
die
a
hundred
deaths
,
<EOS>
ere
ever
he
'd
break
his
word
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
of
him
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
Stephen
had
remained
quietly
attentive
,
in
his
usual
thoughtful
attitude
,
with
his
hand
at
his
chin
.
 
<EOS>
He
now
spoke
in
a
voice
rather
less
steady
than
usual
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
one
,
excepting
myseln
,
can
ever
know
what
honour

what

"
   
<EOS>
Louisa
turned
her
head
to
him
,
and
bent
it
with
a
deference
that
was
new
in
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
from
him
to
Rachael
,
and
her
features
softened
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
will
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
her
voice
had
softened
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
Weel
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Stephen
,
making
the
best
of
it
,
with
a
smile
;
"
when
I
ha
finished
off
,
I
mun
quit
this
part
,
and

another

<EOS>
Fortnet

<EOS>
"
How

travel

"
   
<EOS>
"
Afoot
,
my
kind
ledy
,
afoot
.
"
   
<EOS>
Louisa
coloured
,
and
a
purse
appeared
in
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
The
rustling
of
a
bank
-
note
was
audible
,
as
she
unfolded
one
and
laid
it
on
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
Rachael
,
will
you
tell
him
---
for
you
know
how
,
without
offence

that
this
is
freely

to

on

<EOS>
Will
you
entreat
him
to
take
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
canna
do
that
,
young
lady

"
she
answered
,
turning
her
head
aside
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
for
thinking

the

tenderness

<EOS>
But
'
tis
for

know
his
heart
,
and
what
is
right

to
it

"
   
<EOS>
Louisa
looked
,
in
part
incredulous
,
in
part
frightened
,
in
part
overcome
with
quick
sympathy
,
when
this
man
of
so
much
self
-
command
,
who
had
been
so
plain
and
steady
through
the
late
interview
,
lost
his
composure
in
a
moment
,
and
now
stood
with
his
hand
before
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
She
stretched
out
hers
,
as
if
she
would
have
touched
him
;
then
checked
herself
,
and
remained
still
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
e'en
Rachael
,
"
said
Stephen
,
when
he
stood
again
with
his
face
uncovered
,
"
could
mak
sitch
a
kind
offerin
,
by
onny

my
lastin
thankfulness

this

action

"
   
<EOS>
She
was
fain
to
take
up
the
note
again
,
and
to
substitute
the
much
smaller
sum
he
had
named
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
neither
courtly
,
nor
handsome
,
nor
picturesque
,
in
any
respect
;
and
yet
his
manner
of
accepting
it
,
and
of
expressing
his
thanks
without
more
words
,
had
a
grace
in
it
that
Lord
Chesterfield
could
not
have
taught
his
son
in
a
century
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
had
sat
upon
the
bed
,
swinging
one
leg
and
sucking
his
walking
-
stick
with
sufficient
unconcern
,
until
the
visit
had
attained
this
stage
.
 
<EOS>
Seeing
his
sister
ready
to
depart
,
he
got
up
,
rather
hurriedly
,
and
put
in
a
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Just
wait
a
moment
,
Loo
!
 
<EOS>
Before
we
go
,
I
should
like
to
speak
to
him
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Something
comes
into
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
'll
step
out
on
the
stairs
,
Blackpool
,
I
'll
mention
it
.
 
<EOS>
Never
mind
a
light
,
man
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tom
was
remarkably
impatient
of
his
moving
towards
the
cupboard
,
to
get
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
do
n't
want
a
light
.
"
   
<EOS>
Stephen
followed
him
out
,
and
Tom
closed
the
room
door
,
and
held
the
lock
in
his
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
!
<EOS>
"
he
whispered
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
can
do
you
a
good
turn
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
ask
me
what
it
is
,
because
it
may
not
come
to
anything
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
's
no
harm
in
my
trying
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
His
breath
fell
like
a
flame
of
fire
on
Stephen
's
ear
,
it
was
so
hot
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
was
our
light
porter
at
the
Bank
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
who
brought
you
the
message
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
him
our
light
porter
,
because
I
belong
to
the
Bank
too
.
"
   
<EOS>
Stephen
thought
,
"
What
a
hurry
he
is
in
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
spoke
so
confusedly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
look
here
!
 
<EOS>
When
are
you
off
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
T

day
's
Monday

"
replied
Stephen
,
considering
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
Friday
or
Saturday
,
nigh
'
bout
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Friday
or
Saturday

"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
look
here
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
sure
that
I
can
do
you
the
good
turn
I
want
to
do
you
---
that
's
my
sister
,
you
know

in
your

but
I
may
be
able
to
,
and
if
I
should
not
be
able
to
<EOS>
,
there
's
no
harm
done
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
tell
you
what
.
<EOS>
You
'll
know
our
light
porter
again
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sure
,
"
said
Stephen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
returned
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
you
leave
work
of
a
night
,
between
this
and
your
going
away
,
just
hang
about
the
Bank
an
hour
or
so
,
will
you
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
take
on
,
as
if
you
meant
anything
,
if
he
should
see
you
hanging
about
there
;
because
I
sha
n't
put
him
up
to
speak
to
you
,
unless
I
find
I
can
do
you
the
service
I
want
to
do
you
.
 
<EOS>
In
that
case
he
'll
have
a
note
or
a
message
for
you
,
but
not
else
.
 
<EOS>
Now
look
here
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
sure
you
understand
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
wormed
a
finger
,
in
the
darkness
,
through
a
button
-
hole
of
Stephen
's
coat
,
and
was
screwing
that
corner
of
the
garment
tight
up
round
and
round
,
in
an
extraordinary
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
understand
,
sir
,
"
said
Stephen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
look
here
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
sure
you
do
n't
make
any
mistake
then
,
and
do
n't
forget
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
tell
my
sister
as
we
go
home
,
what
I
have
in
view
,
and
she
'll
approve
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
Now
look
here
!
 
<EOS>
You
're
all
right
,
are
you
?
 
<EOS>
You
understand
all
about
it
?
 
<EOS>
Very
well
then
.
<EOS>
Come
along
,
Loo
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
pushed
the
door
open
as
he
called
to
her
,
but
did
not
return
into
the
room
,
or
wait
to
be
lighted
down
the
narrow
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
at
the
bottom
when
she
began
to
descend
,
and
was
in
the
street
before
she
could
take
his
arm
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Pegler
remained
in
her
corner
until
the
brother
and
sister
were
gone
,
and
until
Stephen
came
back
with
the
candle
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
a
state
of
inexpressible
admiration
of
Mrs
Bounderby
,
and
,
like
an
unaccountable
old
woman
,
wept
,
"
because
she
was
such
a
pretty
dear
.
"
 
<EOS>
Yet
Mrs
Pegler
was
so
flurried
lest
the
object
of
her
admiration
should
return
by
chance
,
or
anybody
else
should
come
,
that
her
cheerfulness
was
ended
for
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
late
too
,
to
people
who
rose
early
and
worked
hard
;
therefore
the
party
broke
up
;
and
Stephen
and
Rachael
escorted
their
mysterious
acquaintance
to
the
door
of
the
Travellers
'
Coffee
House
,
where
they
parted
from
her
.
   
<EOS>
They
walked
back
together
to
the
corner
of
the
street
where
Rachael
lived
,
and
as
they
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
it
,
silence
crept
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
came
to
the
dark
corner
where
their
unfrequent
meetings
always
ended
,
they
stopped
,
still
silent
,
as
if
both
were
afraid
to
speak
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
strive
t
'
<EOS>
see
thee
agen

Rachael
,

afore
I
go

"
Thou

Yes

<EOS>
"

towd
thee

said
Stephen
Blackpool
---
"
that
night

that

It
was
but
<EOS>
a
hurried
parting
in
a
common
street
,
yet
it
was
a
sacred
remembrance
to
these
two
common
people
.
 
<EOS>
Utilitarian
economists
,
skeletons
of
schoolmasters
,
Commissioners
of
Fact
,
genteel
and
used
-
up
infidels
,
gabblers
of
many
little
dog's
-
eared
creeds
,
the
poor
you
will
have
always
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
Cultivate
in
them
,
<EOS>
while
there
is
yet
time
,
the
utmost
graces
of
the
fancies
and
affections
,
to
adorn
their
lives
so
much
in
need
of
ornament
;
or
,
in
the
day
of
your
triumph
,
when
romance
is
utterly
driven
out
of
their
souls
,
and
they
and
a
bare
existence
stand
face
to
face
,
Reality
will
take
a
wolfish
turn
,
and
make
an
end
of
you

<EOS>
Stephen
worked
the
next
day
,
and
the
next
,
uncheered
by
a
word
from
any
one
,
and
shunned
in
all
his
comings
and
goings
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
the
second
day
,
he
saw
land
;
at
the
end
of
the
third
,
his
loom
stood
empty
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
overstayed
his
hour
in
the
street
outside
the
Bank
,
on
each
of
the
two
first
evenings
;
and
nothing
had
happened
there
,
good
or
bad
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
might
not
be
remiss
in
his
part
of
the
engagement
,
he
resolved
to
wait
full
two
hours
,
on
this
third
and
last
night
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
the
lady
who
had
once
kept
Mr
Bounderby
's
house
,
sitting
at
the
first
-
floor
window
as
he
had
seen
her
before
;
and
there
was
the
light
porter
,
sometimes
talking
with
her
there
,
and
sometimes
looking
over
the
blind
below
which
had
BANK
upon
it
,
and
sometimes
coming
to
the
door
and
standing
on
the
steps
for
a
breath
of
air
.
<EOS>
When
he
first
came
out
,
Stephen
thought
he
might
be
looking
for
him
,
and
passed
near
;
but
the
light
porter
only
cast
his
winking
eyes
upon
him
slightly
,
and
said
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
Two
hours
were
a
long
stretch
of
lounging
about
,
after
a
long
day
's
labour
.
 
<EOS>
Stephen
sat
upon
the
step
of
a
door
,
leaned
against
a
wall
under
an
archway
,
strolled
up
and
down
,
listened
for
the
church
clock
,
stopped
and
watched
children
playing
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
Some
purpose
or
other
is
so
natural
to
every
one
,
that
a
mere
loiterer
always
looks
and
feels
remarkable
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
first
hour
was
out
,
Stephen
even
began
to
have
an
uncomfortable
sensation
upon
him
of
being
for
the
time
a
disreputable
character
.
   
<EOS>
Then
came
the
lamplighter
,
and
two
lengthening
lines
of
light
all
down
the
long
perspective
of
the
street
,
until
they
were
blended
and
lost
in
the
distance
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
closed
the
first
-
floor
window
,
drew
down
the
blind
,
and
went
up
-
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
,
a
light
went
up
-
stairs
after
her
,
passing
first
the
fanlight
of
the
door
,
and
afterwards
the
two
staircase
windows
,
on
its
way
up
.
 
<EOS>
By
and
by
<EOS>
,
one
corner
of
the
second
-
floor
blind
was
disturbed
,
as
if
Mrs
Sparsit
's
eye
were
there
;
also
the
other
corner
,
as
if
the
light
porter
's
eye
were
on
that
side
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
no
communication
was
made
to
Stephen
.
 
<EOS>
Much
relieved
when
the
two
hours
were
at
last
accomplished
,
he
went
away
at
a
quick
pace
,
as
a
recompense
for
so
much
loitering
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
only
to
take
leave
of
his
landlady
,
and
lie
down
on
his
temporary
bed
upon
the
floor
;
for
his
bundle
was
made
up
for
to
-
morrow
,
and
all
was
arranged
for
his
departure
.
 
<EOS>
He
meant
to
be
clear
of
the
town
very
early
;
before
the
Hands
were
in
the
streets
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
barely
daybreak
,
when
,
with
a
parting
look
round
his
room
,
mournfully
wondering
whether
he
should
ever
see
it
again
,
he
went
out
.
 
<EOS>
The
town
was
as
entirely
deserted
as
if
the
inhabitants
had
abandoned
it
,
rather
than
hold
communication
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
looked
wan
at
that
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
coming
sun
made
but
a
pale
waste
in
the
sky
,
like
a
sad
sea
.
   
<EOS>
By
the
place
where
Rachael
lived
,
though
it
was
not
in
his
way
;
by
the
red
brick
streets
;
by
the
great
silent
factories
,
not
trembling
yet
;
by
the
railway
,
where
the
danger
-
lights
were
waning
in
the
strengthening
day
;
by
the
railway
's
crazy
neighbourhood
,
half
pulled
down
and
half
built
up
;
by
scattered
red
brick
villas
,
where
the
besmoked
evergreens
were
sprinkled
with
a
dirty
powder
,
like
untidy
snuff
-
takers
;
by
coal
-
dust
paths
and
many
varieties
of
ugliness
;
Stephen
got
to
the
top
of
the
hill
,
and
looked
back
.
   
<EOS>
Day
was
shining
radiantly
upon
the
town
then
,
and
the
bells
were
going
for
the
morning
work
.
 
<EOS>
Domestic
fires
were
not
yet
lighted
,
and
the
high
chimneys
had
the
sky
to
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Puffing
out
their
poisonous
volumes
,
they
would
not
be
long
in
hiding
it
;
but
,
for
half
an
hour
,
some
of
the
many
windows
were
golden
,
which
showed
the
Coketown
people
a
sun
eternally
in
eclipse
,
through
a
medium
of
smoked
glass
.
   
<EOS>
So
strange
to
turn
from
the
chimneys
to
the
birds
.
 
<EOS>
So
strange
,
to
have
the
road
-
dust
on
his
feet
instead
of
the
coal
-
grit
.
 
<EOS>
So
strange
to
have
lived
to
his
time
of
life
,
and
yet
to
be
beginning
like
a
boy
this
summer
morning
!
 
<EOS>
With
these
musings
in
his
mind
,
and
his
bundle
under
his
arm
,
Stephen
took
his
attentive
face
along
the
high
road
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
trees
arched
over
him
,
whispering
that
he
left
a
true
and
loving
heart
behind
.

<EOS>
Gunpowder
 
Mr
James
Harthouse
,
"
going
in
"
for
his
adopted
party
,
soon
began
to
score
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
aid
of
a
little
more
coaching
for
the
political
sages
,
a
little
more
genteel
listlessness
for
the
general
society
,
and
a
tolerable
management
of
the
assumed
honesty
in
dishonesty
,
most
effective
and
most
patronized
of
the
polite
deadly
sins
,
he
speedily
came
to
be
considered
of
much
promise
.
 
<EOS>
The
not
being
troubled
with
earnestness
was
a
grand
point
in
his
favour
,
enabling
him
to
take
to
the
hard
Fact
<EOS>
fellows
with
as
good
a
grace
as
if
he
had
been
born
one
of
the
tribe
,
and
to
throw
all
other
tribes
overboard
,
as
conscious
hypocrites
.
   
<EOS>
"
Whom
none
of
us
believe
,
my
dear
Mrs
Bounderby
,
and
who
do
not
believe
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
difference
between
us
and
the
professors
of
virtue
or
benevolence
,
or
philanthropy
---
never
mind
the
name
---
is
,
that
we
know
it
is
all
meaningless
,
and
say
so
;
while
they
know
it
equally
and
will
never
say
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
Why
should
she
be
shocked
or
warned
by
this
reiteration
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
so
unlike
her
father
's
principles
,
and
her
early
training
,
that
it
need
startle
her
.
 
<EOS>
Where
was
the
great
difference
between
the
two
schools
,
when
each
chained
her
down
to
material
realities
,
and
inspired
her
with
no
faith
in
anything
else
?
 
<EOS>
What
was
there
in
her
soul
for
James
Harthouse
to
destroy
,
which
Thomas
Gradgrind
had
nurtured
there
in
its
state
of
innocence
!
   
<EOS>
It
was
even
the
worse
for
her
at
this
pass
,
that
in
her
mind
---
implanted
there
before
her
eminently
practical
father
began
to
form
it
---
a
struggling
disposition
to
believe
in
a
wider
and
nobler
humanity
than
she
had
ever
heard
of
,
constantly
strove
with
doubts
and
resentments
.
 
<EOS>
With
doubts
,
because
the
aspiration
had
been
so
laid
waste
in
her
youth
.
 
<EOS>
With
resentments
,
because
of
the
wrong
that
had
been
done
her
,
if
it
were
indeed
a
whisper
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Upon
a
nature
long
accustomed
to
self
-
suppression
,
thus
torn
and
divided
,
the
Harthouse
philosophy
came
as
a
relief
and
justification
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
being
hollow
and
worthless
,
she
had
missed
nothing
and
sacrificed
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
What
did
it
matter
,
she
had
said
to
her
father
,
when
he
proposed
her
husband
.
 
<EOS>
What
did
it
matter
,
she
said
still
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
scornful
self
-
reliance
,
she
asked
herself
,
What
did
anything
matter
---
and
went
on
.
   
<EOS>
Towards
what
?
 
<EOS>
Step
by
step
,
onward
and
downward
,
towards
some
end
,
yet
so
gradually
,
that
she
believed
herself
to
remain
motionless
.
<EOS>
As
to
Mr
Harthouse
,
whither
he
tended
,
he
neither
considered
nor
cared
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
particular
design
or
plan
before
him
:
 
no
energetic
wickedness
ruffled
his
lassitude
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
as
much
amused
and
interested
,
at
present
,
as
it
became
so
fine
a
gentleman
to
be
;
perhaps
even
more
than
it
would
have
been
consistent
with
his
reputation
to
confess
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
his
arrival
he
languidly
wrote
to
his
brother
,
the
honourable
and
jocular
member
,
that
the
Bounderbys
were
"
great
fun
;
"
and
further
,
that
the
female
Bounderby
,
instead
of
being
the
Gorgon
he
had
expected
,
was
young
,
and
remarkably
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
After
that
,
he
wrote
no
more
about
them
,
and
devoted
his
leisure
chiefly
to
their
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
very
often
in
their
house
,
in
his
flittings
and
visitings
about
the
Coketown
district
;
and
was
much
encouraged
by
Mr
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
quite
in
Mr
Bounderby
's
gusty
way
to
boast
to
all
his
world
that
he
did
n't
care
about
your
highly
connected
people
,
but
that
if
his
wife
Tom
Gradgrind
's
daughter
did
,
she
was
welcome
to
their
company
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
James
Harthouse
began
to
think
it
would
be
a
new
sensation
,
if
the
face
which
changed
so
beautifully
for
the
whelp
,
would
change
for
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
quick
enough
to
observe
;
he
had
a
good
memory
,
and
did
not
forget
a
word
of
the
brother
's
revelations
.
 
<EOS>
He
interwove
them
with
everything
he
saw
of
the
sister
,
and
he
began
to
understand
her
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
the
better
and
profounder
part
of
her
character
was
not
within
his
scope
of
perception
;
for
in
natures
,
as
in
seas
,
depth
answers
unto
depth
;
but
he
soon
began
to
read
the
rest
with
a
student
's
eye
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
had
taken
possession
of
a
house
and
grounds
,
about
fifteen
miles
from
the
town
,
and
accessible
within
a
mile
or
two
,
by
a
railway
striding
on
many
arches
over
a
wild
country
,
undermined
by
deserted
coal
-
shafts
,
and
spotted
at
night
by
fires
and
black
shapes
of
stationary
engines
at
pits
'
mouths
.
 
<EOS>
This
country
,
gradually
softening
towards
the
neighbourhood
of
Mr
Bounderby
's
retreat
,
there
mellowed
into
a
rustic
landscape
,
golden
with
heath
,
and
snowy
with
hawthorn
in
the
spring
of
the
year
,
and
tremulous
with
leaves
and
their
shadows
all
the
summer
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
bank
had
foreclosed
a
mortgage
effected
on
the
property
thus
pleasantly
situated
,
by
one
of
the
Coketown
magnates
,
who
,
in
his
determination
to
make
a
shorter
cut
than
usual
to
an
enormous
fortune
,
overspeculated
himself
by
about
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
These
accidents
did
sometimes
happen
in
the
best
regulated
families
of
Coketown
,
but
the
bankrupts
had
no
connexion
whatever
with
the
improvident
classes
.
   
<EOS>
It
afforded
Mr
Bounderby
supreme
satisfaction
to
instal
himself
in
this
snug
little
estate
,
and
with
demonstrative
humility
to
grow
cabbages
in
the
flower
-
garden
.
 
<EOS>
He
delighted
to
live
,
barrack
-
fashion
,
among
the
elegant
furniture
,
and
he
bullied
the
very
pictures
with
his
origin
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
"
he
would
say
to
a
visitor
,
"
I
am
told
that
Nickits
,
"
the
late
owner
,
"
gave
seven
hundred
pound
for
that
Seabeach
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
to
be
plain
with
you
,
if
I
ever
,
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
,
take
seven
looks
at
it
,
at
a
hundred
pound
a
look
,
it
will
be
as
much
as
I
shall
do
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
by
George
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
forget
that
I
am
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
.
 
<EOS>
For
years
upon
years
,
the
only
pictures
in
my
possession
,
or
that
I
could
have
got
into
my
possession
,
by
any
means
,
unless
I
stole
'em
,
were
the
engravings
of
a
man
shaving
himself
in
a
boot
,
on
the
blacking
bottles
that
I
was
overjoyed
to
use
in
cleaning
boots
with
,
and
that
I
sold
when
they
were
empty
for
a
farthing
a
-
piece
,
and
glad
to
get
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
Then
he
would
address
Mr
Harthouse
in
the
same
style
.
   
<EOS>
"
Harthouse
,
you
have
a
couple
of
horses
down
here
.
 
<EOS>
Bring
half
a
dozen
more
if
you
like
,
and
we
'll
find
room
for
'em
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
stabling
in
this
place
for
a
dozen
horses
;
and
unless
Nickits
is
belied
,
he
kept
the
full
number
.
 
<EOS>
A
round
dozen
of
'em
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
When
that
man
was
a
boy
,
he
went
to
Westminster
School
.
 
<EOS>
Went
to
Westminster
School
as
a
King
's
Scholar
,
when
I
was
principally
living
on
garbage
,
and
sleeping
in
market
baskets
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
if
I
wanted
to
keep
a
dozen
horses
---
which
I
do
n't
,
for
one
's
enough
for
me
---
I
could
n't
bear
to
see
'em
in
their
stalls
here
,
and
think
what
my
own
lodging
used
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
look
at
'em
,
sir
,
and
not
order
'em
out
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
so
things
come
round
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
this
place
;
you
know
what
sort
of
a
place
it
is
;
you
are
aware
that
there
's
not
a
completer
place
of
its
size
in
this
kingdom
or
elsewhere
---
I
do
n't
care
where

and
here
,
got
into
the
middle
of
it
,
like
a
maggot
into
a
nut

is
Josiah
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
While
Nickits
(
as
a
man
came
into
my
office
,
and
told
me
yesterday
)
,
Nickits
,
who
used
to
act
in
Latin

in
the
Westminster
School
plays

with
the
chief

country
applauding

they
were
black

drivelling

minute

drivelling

<EOS>
---
in
a
fifth
floor
,
up
a
narrow
dark
back
street
in
Antwerp

"
   
<EOS>
It
was
among
the
leafy
shadows
of
this
retirement
,
in
the
long
sultry
summer
days
,
that
Mr
Harthouse
began
to
prove
the
face
which
had
set
him
wondering
when
he
first
saw
it
,
and
to
try
if
it
would
change
for
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Bounderby
,
I
esteem
it
a
most
fortunate
accident
that
I
find
you
alone
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
for
some
time
had
a
particular
wish
to
speak
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
by
any
wonderful
accident
that
he
found
her
,
the
time
of
day
being
that
at
which
she
was
always
alone
,
and
the
place
being
her
favourite
resort
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
opening
in
a
dark
wood
,
where
some
felled
trees
lay
,
and
where
she
would
sit
watching
the
fallen
leaves
of
last
year
,
as
she
had
watched
the
falling
ashes
at
home
.
   
<EOS>
He
sat
down
beside
her
,
with
a
glance
at
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
brother
.
 
<EOS>
My
young
friend
Tom
---
"
   
Her
colour
brightened
,
and
<EOS>
she
turned
to
him
with
a
look
of
interest
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
in
my
life
,
"
he
thought
,
"
saw
anything
so
remarkable
and
so
captivating
as
the
lighting
of
those
features
!
"
<EOS>
His
face
betrayed
his
thoughts
---
perhaps
without
betraying
him
,
for
it
might
have
been
according
to
its
instructions
so
to
do
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
expression
of
your
sisterly
interest
is
so
beautiful
---
Tom
should
be
so
proud
of
it
---
<EOS>
I
know
this
is
inexcusable
,
but
I
am
so
compelled
to
admire
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Being
so
impulsive
,
"
she
said
composedly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Bounderby
,
<EOS>
no
:
 
<EOS>
you
know
I
make
no
pretence
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
I
am
a
sordid
piece
of
human
nature
,
ready
to
sell
myself
at
any
time
for
any
reasonable
sum
,
and
altogether
incapable
of
any
Arcadian
proceeding
whatever
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
waiting
,
"
<EOS>
she
returned
,
"
for
your
further
reference
to
my
brother
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
rigid
with
me
,
and
I
deserve
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
as
worthless
a
dog
as
you
will
find
,
except
that
I
am
not
false
---
not
false
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
surprised
and
started
me
from
my
subject
,
which
was
your
brother
.
<EOS>
I
have
an
interest
in
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
an
interest
in
anything
,
Mr
Harthouse
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
half
incredulously
and
half
gratefully
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
asked
me
when
I
first
came
here
,
I
should
have
said
no
.
<EOS>
I
must
say
now
---
even
at
the
hazard
of
appearing
to
make
a
pretence
,
and
of
justly
awakening
your
incredulity
---
yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
made
a
slight
movement
,
as
if
she
were
trying
to
speak
,
but
could
not
find
voice
;
at
length
she
said
,
"
Mr
Harthouse
,
I
give
you
credit
for
being
interested
in
my
brother
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
claim
to
deserve
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
how
little
I
do
claim
,
but
I
will
go
that
length
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
done
so
much
for
him
<EOS>
,
you
are
so
fond
of
him
;
your
whole
life
,
Mrs
Bounderby
,
expresses
such
charming
self
-
forgetfulness
on
his
account
---
pardon
me
again
---
I
am
running
wide
of
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
interested
in
him
for
his
own
sake
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
She
had
made
the
slightest
action
possible
,
as
if
she
would
have
risen
in
a
hurry
and
gone
away
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
turned
the
course
of
what
he
said
at
that
instant
,
and
she
remained
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Bounderby
,
"
he
resumed
,
in
a
lighter
manner
,
and
yet
with
a
show
of
effort
in
assuming
it
,
which
was
even
more
expressive
than
the
manner
he
dismissed
;
"
it
is
no
irrevocable
offence
in
a
young
fellow
of
your
brother
's
years
,
if
he
is
heedless
,
inconsiderate
,
and
expensive
---
a
little
dissipated
,
in
the
common
phrase
.
 
<EOS>
Is
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Allow
me
to
be
frank
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
he
games
at
all
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
makes
bets
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Harthouse
waiting
,
as
if
that
were
not
her
whole
answer
,
she
added
,
"
I
know
he
does
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
loses
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Everybody
does
lose
who
bets
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
hint
at
the
probability
of
your
sometimes
supplying
him
with
money
for
these
purposes
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
sat
,
looking
down
;
but
,
at
this
question
,
raised
her
eyes
searchingly
and
a
little
resentfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
Acquit
me
of
impertinent
curiosity
,
my
dear
Mrs
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
Tom
may
be
gradually
falling
into
trouble
,
and
I
wish
to
stretch
out
a
helping
hand
to
him
from
the
depths
of
my
wicked
experience
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Shall
I
say
again
,
for
his
sake
?
 
<EOS>
Is
that
necessary
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
try
to
answer
,
but
nothing
came
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Candidly
to
confess
everything
that
has
occurred
to
me
,
"
said
James
Harthouse
,
again
gliding
with
the
same
appearance
of
effort
into
his
more
airy
manner
;
"
I
will
confide
to
you
my
doubt
whether
he
has
had
many
advantages
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
---
forgive
my
plainness
---
whether
any
great
amount
of
confidence
is
likely
to
have
been
established
between
himself
and
his
most
worthy
father
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
,
"
said
Louisa
,
flushing
with
her
own
great
remembrance
in
that
wise
,
"
think
it
likely
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Or
,
between
himself
,
<EOS>
and
---
I
may
trust
to
your
perfect
understanding
of
my
meaning
,
I
am
sure
---
and
his
highly
esteemed
brother
-
in
-
law
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
flushed
deeper
and
deeper
,
and
was
burning
red
when
she
replied
in
a
fainter
voice
,
"
I
do
not
think
that
likely
,
either
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Bounderby
,
"
said
Harthouse
,
after
a
short
silence
,
"
may
there
be
a
better
confidence
between
yourself
and
me
?
 
<EOS>
Tom
has
borrowed
a
considerable
sum
of
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
understand
,
Mr
Harthouse
,
"
she
returned
,
after
some
indecision
:
 
<EOS>
she
had
been
more
or
less
uncertain
,
and
troubled
throughout
the
conversation
,
and
yet
had
in
the
main
preserved
her
self
-
contained
manner
;
"
you
will
understand
that
if
I
tell
you
what
you
press
to
know
,
it
is
not
by
way
of
complaint
or
regret
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
never
complain
of
anything
,
and
what
I
have
done
<EOS>
I
do
not
in
the
least
regret
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
spirited
,
too
!
"
thought
James
Harthouse
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
married
,
I
found
that
my
brother
was
even
at
that
time
heavily
in
debt
.
 
<EOS>
Heavily
for
him
,
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
Heavily
enough
to
oblige
me
to
sell
some
trinkets
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
no
sacrifice
.
 
<EOS>
I
sold
them
very
willingly
.
 
<EOS>
I
attached
no
value
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
,
were
quite
worthless
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Either
she
saw
in
his
face
that
he
knew
,
or
she
only
feared
in
her
conscience
that
he
knew
,
that
she
spoke
of
some
of
her
husband
's
gifts
.
 
<EOS>
She
stopped
,
and
reddened
again
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
not
known
it
before
,
he
would
have
known
it
then
,
though
he
had
been
a
much
duller
man
than
he
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
Since
then
,
I
have
given
my
brother
,
at
various
times
,
what
money
I
could
spare
:
 
in
short
,
what
money
I
have
had
.
 
<EOS>
Confiding
in
you
at
all
,
on
the
faith
of
the
interest
you
profess
for
him
,
I
will
not
do
so
by
halves
.
 
<EOS>
Since
you
have
been
in
the
habit
of
visiting
here
,
he
has
wanted
in
one
sum
as
much
as
a
hundred
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
been
able
to
give
it
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
felt
uneasy
for
the
consequences
of
his
being
so
involved
,
but
I
have
kept
these
secrets
until
now
,
when
I
trust
them
to
your
honour
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
held
no
confidence
with
any
one
,
because
---
you
anticipated
my
reason
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
abruptly
broke
off
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
a
ready
man
,
and
he
saw
,
and
seized
,
an
opportunity
here
of
presenting
her
own
image
to
her
,
slightly
disguised
as
her
brother
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Bounderby
,
though
a
graceless
person
,
of
the
world
worldly
,
I
feel
the
utmost
interest
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
in
what
you
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
possibly
be
hard
upon
your
brother
.
 
<EOS>
I
understand
and
share
the
wise
consideration
with
which
you
regard
his
errors
.
 
<EOS>
With
all
possible
respect
both
for
Mr
Gradgrind
and
for
Mr
Bounderby
,
I
think
I
perceive
that
he
has
not
been
fortunate
in
his
training
.
<EOS>
Bred
at
a
disadvantage
towards
the
society
in
which
he
has
his
part
to
play
,
he
rushes
into
these
extremes
for
himself
,
from
opposite
extremes
that
have
long
been
forced
---
with
the
very
best
intentions
we
have
no
doubt
---
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
's
fine
bluff
English
independence
,
though
a
most
charming
characteristic
,
does
not
---
as
we
have
agreed
---
invite
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
might
venture
to
remark
that
it
is
the
least
in
the
world
deficient
in
that
delicacy
to
which
a
youth
mistaken
,
a
character
misconceived
,
and
abilities
misdirected
,
would
turn
for
relief
and
guidance
,
I
should
express
what
it
presents
to
my
own
view
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
she
sat
looking
straight
before
her
,
across
the
changing
lights
upon
the
grass
into
the
darkness
of
the
wood
beyond
,
he
saw
in
her
face
her
application
of
his
very
distinctly
uttered
words
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
allowance
,
"
he
continued
,
"
must
be
made
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
one
great
fault
to
find
with
Tom
,
however
,
which
I
can
not
forgive
,
and
for
which
I
take
him
heavily
to
account
.
"
   
<EOS>
Louisa
turned
her
eyes
to
his
face
,
and
asked
him
what
fault
was
that
?
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
"
he
returned
,
"
I
have
said
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
,
on
the
whole
,
if
no
allusion
to
it
had
escaped
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
alarm
me
,
Mr
Harthouse
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
let
me
know
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
relieve
you
from
needless
apprehension
---
and
as
this
confidence
regarding
your
brother
,
which
I
prize
I
am
sure
above
all
possible
things
,
has
been
established
between
us
---
I
obey
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
forgive
him
for
not
being
more
sensible
in
every
word
,
look
,
and
act
of
his
life
,
of
the
affection
of
his
best
friend
;
of
the
devotion
of
his
best
friend
;
of
her
unselfishness
;
of
her
sacrifice
.
 
<EOS>
The
return
he
makes
her
,
within
my
observation
,
is
a
very
poor
one
.
 
<EOS>
What
she
has
done
for
him
demands
his
constant
love
and
gratitude
,
not
his
ill
-
humour
and
caprice
.
 
<EOS>
Careless
fellow
as
I
am
,
I
am
not
so
indifferent
,
Mrs
Bounderby
,
as
to
be
regardless
of
this
vice
in
your
brother
,
or
inclined
to
consider
it
a
venial
offence
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
wood
floated
before
her
,
for
her
eyes
were
suffused
with
tears
.
<EOS>
They
rose
from
a
deep
well
,
long
concealed
,
and
her
heart
was
filled
with
acute
pain
that
found
no
relief
in
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
a
word
,
it
is
to
correct
your
brother
in
this
,
<EOS>
Mrs
Bounderby
,
that
I
must
aspire
.
 
<EOS>
My
better
knowledge
of
his
circumstances
,
and
my
direction
and
advice
in
extricating
them
---
rather
valuable
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
as
coming
from
a
scapegrace
on
a
much
larger
scale
---
will
give
me
some
influence
over
him
,
and
<EOS>
all
I
gain
I
shall
certainly
use
towards
this
end
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
said
enough
,
and
more
than
enough
.
 
<EOS>
I
seem
to
be
protesting
that
I
am
a
sort
of
good
fellow
,
when
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
have
not
the
least
intention
to
make
any
protestation
to
that
effect
,
and
openly
announce
that
I
am
nothing
of
the
sort
.
<EOS>
Yonder
,
among
the
trees
,
"
he
added
,
having
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
looked
about
;
for
he
had
watched
her
closely
until
now
;
"
is
your
brother
himself
;
no
doubt
,
just
come
down
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
seems
to
be
loitering
in
this
direction
,
it
may
be
as
well
,
perhaps
,
to
walk
towards
him
,
and
throw
ourselves
in
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
been
very
silent
and
doleful
of
late
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
his
brotherly
conscience
is
touched
---
if
there
are
such
things
as
consciences
.
 
<EOS>
Though
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
hear
of
them
much
too
often
to
believe
in
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
assisted
her
to
rise
,
and
she
took
his
arm
,
and
they
advanced
to
meet
the
whelp
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
idly
beating
the
branches
as
he
lounged
along
:
 
or
he
stooped
viciously
to
rip
the
moss
from
the
trees
with
his
stick
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
startled
when
they
came
upon
him
while
he
was
engaged
in
this
latter
pastime
,
and
his
colour
changed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
"
<EOS>
he
stammered
;
"
I
did
n't
know
you
were
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Whose
name
,
Tom
,
"
said
Mr
Harthouse
,
putting
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
turning
him
,
so
that
they
all
three
walked
towards
the
house
together
,
"
have
you
been
carving
on
the
trees
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Whose
name
?
"
returned
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
You
mean
what
girl
's
name
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
suspicious
appearance
of
inscribing
some
fair
creature
's
on
the
bark
,
Tom
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
much
of
that
,
Mr
Harthouse
,
unless
some
fair
creature
with
a
slashing
fortune
at
her
own
disposal
would
take
a
fancy
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Or
she
might
be
as
ugly
as
she
was
rich
,
without
any
fear
of
losing
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
'd
carve
her
name
as
often
as
she
liked
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
you
are
mercenary
,
Tom
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mercenary

repeated
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
is
not
mercenary
?
 
<EOS>
Ask
my
sister
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Have
you
so
proved
it
to
be
a
failing
of
mine
,
Tom
?
"
said
Louisa
,
showing
no
other
sense
of
his
discontent
and
ill
-
nature
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
whether
the
cap
fits
you
,
Loo
,
"
returned
her
brother
sulkily
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
it
does
,
you
can
wear
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
is
misanthropical
to
-
day
,
as
all
bored
people
are
now
and
then
,
"
said
Mr
Harthouse
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
believe
him
,
Mrs
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
He
knows
much
better
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
disclose
some
of
his
opinions
of
you
,
privately
expressed
to
me
,
unless
he
relents
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
all
events
,
Mr
Harthouse
,
"
said
Tom
,
softening
in
his
admiration
of
his
patron
,
but
shaking
his
head
sullenly
too
,
"
you
ca
n't
tell
her
that
I
ever
praised
her
for
being
mercenary
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
praised
her
for
being
the
contrary
,
and
I
should
do
it
again
,
if
I
had
as
good
reason
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
never
mind
this
now
;
it
's
not
very
interesting
to
you
,
and
I
am
sick
of
the
subject
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
walked
on
to
the
house
,
where
Louisa
quitted
her
visitor
's
arm
and
went
in
.
 
<EOS>
He
stood
looking
after
her
,
as
she
ascended
the
steps
,
and
passed
into
the
shadow
of
the
door
;
then
put
his
hand
upon
her
brother
's
shoulder
again
,
and
invited
him
with
a
confidential
nod
to
a
walk
in
the
garden
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
my
fine
fellow
,
I
want
to
have
a
word
with
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
had
stopped
among
a
disorder
of
roses
---
it
was
part
of
Mr
Bounderby
's
humility
to
keep
Nickits
's
roses
on
a
reduced
scale
---
and
Tom
sat
down
on
a
terrace
-
parapet
,
plucking
buds
and
picking
them
to
pieces
;
while
his
powerful
Familiar
stood
over
him
,
with
a
foot
upon
the
parapet
,
and
his
figure
easily
resting
on
the
arm
supported
by
that
knee
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
just
visible
from
her
window
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
saw
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
what
's
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Harthouse
,
"
said
Tom
with
a
groan
,
"
I
am
hard
up
,
and
bothered
out
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
good
fellow
,
so
am
I.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
!
"
returned
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
picture
of
independence
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Harthouse
,
I
am
in
a
horrible
mess
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
no
idea
<EOS>
what
a
state
I
have
got
myself
into
---
<EOS>
what
a
state
<EOS>
my
sister
might
have
got
me
out
of
,
if
she
would
only
have
done
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
took
to
biting
the
rosebuds
now
,
and
tearing
them
away
from
his
teeth
with
a
hand
that
trembled
like
an
infirm
old
man
's
.
 
<EOS>
After
one
exceedingly
observant
look
at
him
,
his
companion
relapsed
into
his
lightest
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
you
are
inconsiderate
:
 
<EOS>
you
expect
too
much
of
your
sister
.
<EOS>
You
have
had
money
of
her
,
<EOS>
you
dog
,
you
know
you
have
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr
Harthouse
,
I
know
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
How
else
was
I
to
get
it
?
<EOS>
Here
's
<EOS>
old
Bounderby
always
boasting
that
at
my
age
he
lived
upon
twopence
a
month
,
or
something
of
that
sort
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
my
father
drawing
what
he
calls
a
line
,
and
tying
me
down
to
it
from
a
baby
,
neck
and
heels
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
my
mother
who
never
has
anything
of
her
own
,
except
her
complaints
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
a
fellow
to
do
for
money
,
and
where
am
I
to
look
for
it
,
if
not
to
my
sister
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
almost
crying
,
and
scattered
the
buds
about
by
dozens
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Harthouse
took
him
persuasively
by
the
coat
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
my
dear
Tom
,
if
your
sister
has
not
got
it
---
"
   
"
Not
got
it
,
Mr
Harthouse
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
she
has
got
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
wanted
more
than
she
was
likely
to
have
got
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
she
ought
to
get
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
get
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
of
no
use
pretending
to
make
a
secret
of
matters
now
<EOS>
,
after
what
I
have
told
you
already
;
you
know
she
did
n't
marry
old
Bounderby
for
her
own
sake
,
or
for
his
sake
,
but
for
my
sake
.
 
<EOS>
Then
why
does
n't
she
get
what
I
want
,
out
of
him
,
for
my
sake
?
 
<EOS>
She
is
not
obliged
to
say
what
she
is
going
to
do
with
it
;
she
is
sharp
enough
;
she
could
manage
to
coax
it
out
of
him
,
if
she
chose
.
 
<EOS>
Then
why
does
n't
she
choose
,
when
I
tell
her
of
what
consequence
it
is
?
 
<EOS>
But
no
.
 
<EOS>
There
she
sits
in
his
company
like
a
stone
,
instead
of
making
herself
agreeable
and
getting
it
easily
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
you
may
call
this
,
but
I
call
it
unnatural
conduct
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
a
piece
of
ornamental
water
immediately
below
the
parapet
,
on
the
other
side
,
into
which
Mr
James
Harthouse
had
a
very
strong
inclination
to
pitch
Mr
Thomas
Gradgrind
junior
,
as
the
injured
men
of
Coketown
threatened
to
pitch
their
property
into
the
Atlantic
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
preserved
his
easy
attitude
;
and
nothing
more
solid
went
over
the
stone
balustrades
than
the
accumulated
rosebuds
now
floating
about
,
a
little
surface
-
island
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Tom
,
"
said
Harthouse
,
"
let
me
try
to
be
your
banker
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
God
's
sake
,
"
replied
Tom
,
suddenly
,
"
do
n't
talk
about
bankers
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
very
white
he
looked
,
in
contrast
with
the
roses
.
<EOS>
Very
white
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Harthouse
,
as
a
thoroughly
well
-
bred
man
,
accustomed
to
the
best
society
,
was
not
to
be
surprised
---
he
could
as
soon
have
been
affected
---
but
he
raised
his
eyelids
a
little
more
,
as
if
they
were
lifted
by
a
feeble
touch
of
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
Albeit
it
was
as
much
against
the
precepts
of
his
school
to
wonder
,
as
it
was
against
the
doctrines
of
the
Gradgrind
College
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
present
need
,
Tom
?
 
<EOS>
Three
figures
?
 
<EOS>
Out
with
them
.
<EOS>
Say
what
they
are
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Harthouse
,
"
returned
Tom
,
now
actually
crying
;
and
his
tears
were
better
than
his
injuries
,
however
pitiful
a
figure
he
made
:
"
it
's
too
late
;
the
money
is
of
no
use
to
me
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
had
it
before
to
be
of
use
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
;
you
're
a
true
friend
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
true
friend
!
 
<EOS>
"
Whelp
,
whelp
!
<EOS>
"
thought
Mr
Harthouse
,
lazily
;
"
what
an
Ass
you
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
take
your
offer
as
a
great
kindness
,
"
said
Tom
,
grasping
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
a
great
kindness
,
Mr
Harthouse
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
returned
the
other
,
"
it
may
be
of
more
use
by
and
by
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
my
good
fellow
,
if
you
will
open
your
bedevilments
to
me
when
they
come
thick
upon
you
,
I
may
show
you
better
ways
out
of
them
than
you
can
find
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
Tom
,
shaking
his
head
dismally
,
and
chewing
rosebuds
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
had
known
you
sooner
,
Mr
Harthouse
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
you
see
,
Tom
,
"
said
Mr
Harthouse
in
conclusion
,
<EOS>
himself
tossing
over
a
rose
or
two
,
as
a
contribution
to
the
island
,
which
was
always
drifting
to
the
wall
as
if
it
wanted
to
become
a
part
of
the
mainland
:
 
"
every
man
is
selfish
in
everything
he
does
,
and
I
am
exactly
like
the
rest
of
my
fellow
-
creatures
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
desperately
intent
;
"
the
languor
of
his
desperation
being
quite
tropical
;
"
on
your
softening
towards
your
sister
---
which
you
ought
to
do
;
and
on
your
being
a
more
loving
and
agreeable
sort
of
brother
---
which
you
ought
to
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
,
Mr
Harthouse
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
time
like
the
present
,
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
Begin
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
I
will
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
sister
Loo
shall
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Having
made
which
bargain
,
Tom
,
"
said
Harthouse
,
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
again
,
with
an
air
which
left
him
at
liberty
to
infer
---
as
he
did
,
poor
fool
---
that
this
condition
was
imposed
upon
him
in
mere
careless
good
nature
to
lessen
his
sense
of
obligation
,
"
we
will
tear
ourselves
asunder
until
dinner
-
time
.
"
   
<EOS>
When
Tom
appeared
before
dinner
,
though
his
mind
seemed
heavy
enough
,
his
body
was
on
the
alert
;
and
he
appeared
before
Mr
Bounderby
came
in
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
mean
to
be
cross
,
Loo
,
"
he
said
,
giving
her
his
hand
,
and
kissing
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
are
fond
of
me
,
and
you
know
I
am
fond
of
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
this
,
there
was
a
smile
upon
Louisa
's
face
that
day
,
for
some
one
else
.
 
<EOS>
Alas
,
for
some
one
else
!
   
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
less
is
the
whelp
the
only
creature
that
she
cares
for
,
"
thought
James
Harthouse
,
reversing
the
reflection
of
his
first
day
's
knowledge
of
her
pretty
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
less
,
so
much
the
less

<EOS>
Explosion
 
<EOS>
The
next
morning
was
too
bright
a
morning
for
sleep
,
and
James
Harthouse
rose
early
,
and
sat
in
the
pleasant
bay
window
of
his
dressing
-
room
,
smoking
the
rare
tobacco
that
had
had
so
wholesome
an
influence
on
his
young
friend
.
 
<EOS>
Reposing
in
the
sunlight
,
with
the
fragrance
of
his
eastern
pipe
about
him
,
and
the
dreamy
smoke
vanishing
into
the
air
,
so
rich
and
soft
with
summer
odours
,
he
reckoned
up
his
advantages
as
an
idle
winner
might
count
his
gains
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
at
all
bored
for
the
time
,
and
could
give
his
mind
to
it
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
established
a
confidence
with
her
,
from
which
her
husband
was
excluded
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
established
a
confidence
with
her
,
that
absolutely
turned
upon
her
indifference
towards
her
husband
,
and
the
absence
,
now
and
at
all
times
,
of
any
congeniality
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
artfully
,
but
plainly
,
assured
her
that
he
knew
her
heart
in
its
last
most
delicate
recesses
;
he
had
come
so
near
to
her
through
its
tenderest
sentiment
;
he
had
associated
himself
with
that
feeling
;
and
the
barrier
behind
which
she
lived
,
had
melted
away
.
 
<EOS>
All
very
odd
,
and
very
satisfactory
!
   
<EOS>
And
yet
he
had
not
,
even
now
,
any
earnest
wickedness
of
purpose
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
Publicly
and
privately
,
it
were
much
better
for
the
age
in
which
he
lived
,
that
he
and
the
legion
of
whom
he
was
one
were
designedly
bad
,
than
indifferent
and
purposeless
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
drifting
icebergs
setting
with
any
current
anywhere
,
that
wreck
the
ships
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
Devil
goeth
about
like
a
roaring
lion
,
he
goeth
about
in
a
shape
by
which
few
but
savages
and
hunters
are
attracted
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
when
he
is
trimmed
,
smoothed
,
and
varnished
,
according
to
the
mode
;
when
he
is
aweary
of
vice
,
and
aweary
of
virtue
,
used
up
as
to
brimstone
,
and
used
up
as
to
bliss
;
then
,
whether
he
take
to
the
serving
out
of
red
tape
,
or
to
the
kindling
of
red
fire
,
he
is
the
very
Devil
.
   
<EOS>
So
James
Harthouse
reclined
in
the
window
,
indolently
smoking
,
and
reckoning
up
the
steps
he
had
taken
on
the
road
by
which
he
happened
to
be
travelling
.
 
<EOS>
The
end
to
which
it
led
was
before
him
,
pretty
plainly
;
but
he
troubled
himself
with
no
calculations
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
will
be
,
will
be
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
had
rather
a
long
ride
to
take
that
day
---
for
there
was
a
public
occasion
"
to
do
"
at
some
distance
,
which
afforded
a
tolerable
opportunity
of
going
in
for
the
Gradgrind
men
<EOS>
---
he
dressed
early
and
went
down
to
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
anxious
to
see
if
she
had
relapsed
since
the
previous
evening
.
 
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
He
resumed
where
he
had
left
off
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
look
of
interest
for
him
again
.
   
<EOS>
He
got
through
the
day
as
much
(
or
as
little
)
to
his
own
satisfaction
,
as
was
to
be
expected
under
the
fatiguing
circumstances
;
and
came
riding
back
at
six
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
sweep
of
some
half
-
mile
between
the
lodge
and
the
house
,
and
he
was
riding
along
at
a
foot
pace
over
the
smooth
gravel
,
once
Nickits
's
,
when
Mr
Bounderby
burst
out
of
the
shrubbery
,
with
such
violence
as
to
make
his
horse
shy
across
the
road
.
   
<EOS>
"
Harthouse
!
"
cried
Mr
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
heard
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Heard
what
?
"
<EOS>
said
Harthouse
,
soothing
his
horse
,
and
inwardly
favouring
Mr
Bounderby
with
no
good
wishes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
have
n't
heard
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
you
,
and
so
has
this
brute
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
heard
nothing
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
,
red
and
hot
,
planted
himself
in
the
centre
of
the
path
before
the
horse
's
head
,
to
explode
his
bombshell
with
more
effect
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
Bank
's
robbed
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Robbed
last
night
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Robbed
in
an
extraordinary
manner
.
<EOS>
Robbed
with
a
false
key
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
much
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
,
in
his
desire
to
make
the
most
of
it
,
really
seemed
mortified
by
being
obliged
to
reply
,
"
Why
,
no
;
not
of
very
much
.
<EOS>
But
it
might
have
been
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
how
much
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
as
a
sum
---
if
you
stick
to
a
sum
---
of
not
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
pound
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
with
impatience
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
not
the
sum
;
it
's
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
the
fact
of
the
Bank
being
robbed
<EOS>
,
that
's
the
important
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
surprised
you
do
n't
see
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Bounderby
,
"
said
James
,
dismounting
,
and
giving
his
bridle
to
his
servant
,
"
I
do
see
it
;
and
am
as
overcome
as
you
can
possibly
desire
me
to
be
,
by
the
spectacle
afforded
to
my
mental
view
.
 
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
may
be
allowed
,
I
hope
,
to
congratulate
you
---
which
I
do
with
all
my
soul
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
---
on
your
not
having
sustained
a
greater
loss
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
"
replied
Bounderby
,
in
a
short
,
ungracious
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
tell
you
what
.
 
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
twenty
thousand
pound
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
might
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Suppose
it
might
!
 
<EOS>
By
the
Lord
,
you
may
suppose
so
.
 
<EOS>
By
George
!
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
,
with
sundry
menacing
nods
and
shakes
of
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
might
have
been
twice
twenty
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
no
knowing
what
it
would
have
been
,
or
would
n't
have
been
,
as
it
was
,
but
for
the
fellows
'
being
disturbed
.
"
   
<EOS>
Louisa
had
come
up
now
,
and
Mrs
Sparsit
,
and
Bitzer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here
's
<EOS>
Tom
Gradgrind
's
daughter
knows
pretty
well
what
it
might
have
been
,
if
you
do
n't
,
"
blustered
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dropped
,
sir
,
as
if
she
was
shot
when
I
told
her
!
 
<EOS>
Never
knew
her
do
such
a
thing
before

<EOS>
Does
her
credit
,
under
the
circumstances
,
in
my
opinion
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
still
looked
faint
and
pale
.
 
<EOS>
James
Harthouse
begged
her
to
take
his
arm
;
and
as
they
moved
on
very
slowly
,
asked
her
how
the
robbery
had
been
committed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
am
going
to
tell
you
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
irritably
giving
his
arm
to
Mrs
Sparsit
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
n't
been
so
mighty
particular
about
the
sum
,
I
should
have
begun
to
tell
you
before
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
this
lady
(
for
she
is
a
lady
)
,
Mrs
Sparsit
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
had
the
honour
---
"
   
"
Very
well
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
young
man
,
Bitzer
,
you
saw
him
too
on
the
same
occasion
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Harthouse
inclined
his
head
in
assent
,
and
Bitzer
knuckled
his
forehead
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well
.
 
<EOS>
They
live
at
the
Bank
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
they
live
at
the
Bank
,
perhaps
?
 
<EOS>
Very
well
.
 
<EOS>
Yesterday
afternoon
,
at
the
close
of
business
hours
,
everything
was
put
away
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
iron
room
that
this
young
fellow
sleeps
outside
of
,
there
was
never
mind
how
much
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
little
safe
in
young
Tom
's
closet
,
the
safe
used
for
petty
purposes
,
there
was
a
hundred
and
fifty
odd
pound
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
hundred
and
fifty
-
four
,
seven
,
one
,
"
said
Bitzer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Bounderby
,
stopping
to
wheel
round
upon
him
,
"
let
's
have
none
of
your
interruptions
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
enough
to
be
robbed
while
you
're
snoring
because
you
're
too
comfortable
,
without
being
put
right
with
your
four
seven
ones
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
snore
,
myself
,
<EOS>
when
I
was
your
age
,
let
me
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
n't
victuals
enough
to
snore
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
did
n't
four
seven
one
.
 
<EOS>
Not
if
I
knew
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Bitzer
knuckled
his
forehead
again
,
in
a
sneaking
manner
,
and
seemed
at
once
particularly
impressed
and
depressed
by
the
instance
last
given
of
Mr
Bounderby
's
moral
abstinence
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
hundred
and
fifty
odd
pound
,
"
resumed
Mr
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
sum
of
money
,
young
Tom
locked
in
his
safe
,
not
a
very
strong
safe
,
but
that
's
no
matter
now
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
was
left
,
all
right
.
 
<EOS>
Some
time
in
the
night
,
while
this
young
fellow
snored
---
Mrs
Sparsit
,
ma'am
,
you
say
you
have
heard
him
snore
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
I
can
not
say
that
I
have
heard
him
precisely
snore
,
and
therefore
must
not
make
that
statement
.
 
<EOS>
But
on
winter
evenings
,
when
he
has
fallen
asleep
at
his
table
,
I
have
heard
him
,
what
I
should
prefer
to
describe
as
partially
choke
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
heard
him
on
such
occasions
<EOS>
produce
sounds
of
a
nature
similar
to
what
may
be
sometimes
heard
in
Dutch
clocks
.
 
<EOS>
Not
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
with
a
lofty
sense
of
giving
strict
evidence
,
"
that
I
would
convey
any
imputation
on
his
moral
character
.
 
<EOS>
Far
from
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
considered
Bitzer
a
young
man
of
the
most
upright
principle
;
and
to
that
I
beg
to
bear
my
testimony
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
the
exasperated
Bounderby
,
"
while
he
was
snoring
,
or
choking
,
or
Dutch
-
clocking
,
or
something
or
other
---
<EOS>
being
asleep
<EOS>
---
some
fellows
,
somehow
,
whether
previously
concealed
in
the
house
or
not
remains
to
be
seen
,
got
to
young
Tom
's
safe
,
forced
it
,
and
abstracted
the
contents
.
 
<EOS>
Being
then
disturbed
,
they
made
off
;
letting
themselves
out
at
the
main
door
,
and
double
-
locking
it
again
(
it
was
double
-
locked
,
and
the
key
under
Mrs
Sparsit
's
pillow
)
with
a
false
key
,
which
was
picked
up
in
the
street
near
the
Bank
,
about
twelve
o'clock
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
No
alarm
takes
place
,
till
this
chap
,
Bitzer
,
turns
out
this
morning
,
and
begins
to
open
and
prepare
the
offices
for
business
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
looking
at
Tom
's
safe
,
he
sees
the
door
ajar
,
and
finds
the
lock
forced
,
and
the
money
gone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
is
Tom
,
by
the
by
?
"
asked
Harthouse
,
glancing
round
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
helping
the
police
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
"
and
stays
behind
at
the
Bank
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
these
fellows
had
tried
to
rob
me
when
I
was
at
his
time
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
have
been
out
of
pocket
if
they
had
invested
eighteenpence
in
the
job
;
I
can
tell
'em
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
anybody
suspected
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Suspected
?
 
<EOS>
I
should
think
there
was
somebody
suspected
.
 
<EOS>
Egod
!
"
said
Bounderby
,
relinquishing
Mrs
Sparsit
's
arm
to
wipe
his
heated
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
is
not
to
be
plundered
and
nobody
suspected
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
thank
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
Might
Mr
Harthouse
inquire
<EOS>
Who
was
suspected
?
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
stopping
and
facing
about
to
confront
them
all
,
"
I
'll
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
to
be
mentioned
everywhere
;
it
's
not
to
be
mentioned
anywhere
:
 
in
order
that
the
scoundrels
concerned
(
there
's
a
gang
of
'em
)
may
be
thrown
off
their
guard
.
 
<EOS>
So
take
this
in
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
Now
wait
a
bit
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
wiped
his
head
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
should
you
say
to
;
"
here
he
violently
exploded
:
 
"
to
a
Hand
being
in
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
said
Harthouse
,
lazily
,
"
not
our
friend
Blackpot
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Say
Pool
instead
of
Pot
,
sir
,
"
returned
Bounderby
,
"
and
that
's
the
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
Louisa
faintly
uttered
some
word
of
incredulity
and
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
O
<EOS>
yes
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
!
"
said
Bounderby
,
immediately
catching
at
the
sound
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
used
to
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
all
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
the
finest
people
in
the
world
,
these
fellows
are
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
got
the
gift
of
the
gab
,
they
have
.
 
<EOS>
They
only
want
to
have
their
rights
explained
to
them
,
they
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
tell
you
what
.
 
<EOS>
Show
me
a
dissatisfied
Hand
,
and
I
'll
show
you
a
man
that
's
fit
for
anything
bad
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
care
what
it
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
Another
of
the
popular
fictions
of
Coketown
,
which
some
pains
had
been
taken
to
disseminate
---
and
which
some
people
really
believed
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
acquainted
with
these
chaps
,
"
said
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
read
'em
off
,
like
books
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
,
ma'am
,
I
appeal
to
you
.
<EOS>
What
warning
did
I
give
that
fellow
,
the
first
time
he
set
foot
in
the
house
,
when
the
express
object
of
his
visit
was
to
know
how
he
could
knock
Religion
over
,
and
floor
the
Established
Church
?
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
,
in
point
of
high
connexions
,
you
are
on
a
level
with
the
aristocracy
,
---
did
I
say
,
or
did
I
not
say
,
to
that
fellow
,
"
you
ca
n't
hide
the
truth
from
me
:
 
<EOS>
you
are
not
the
kind
of
fellow
<EOS>
I
like
<EOS>
;
you
'll
come
to
no
good
"
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Assuredly
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
you
did
,
in
a
highly
impressive
manner
,
give
him
such
an
admonition
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
he
shocked
you
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Bounderby
;
"
when
he
shocked
your
feelings
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
,
with
a
meek
shake
of
her
head
,
"
he
certainly
did
so
.
 
<EOS>
Though
I
do
not
mean
to
say
but
that
my
feelings
may
be
weaker
on
such
points
---
more
foolish
if
the
term
is
preferred
---
than
they
might
have
been
,
if
I
had
always
occupied
my
present
position
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
stared
with
a
bursting
pride
at
Mr
Harthouse
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
I
am
the
proprietor
of
this
female
,
and
she
's
worth
your
attention
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
 
Then
,
resumed
his
discourse
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
recall
for
yourself
,
Harthouse
,
what
I
said
to
him
when
you
saw
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
mince
the
matter
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
never
mealy
with
'em
.
 
<EOS>
I
KNOW
'em
.
 
<EOS>
Very
well
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Three
days
after
that
,
he
bolted
.
 
<EOS>
Went
off
,
nobody
knows
where
:
 
as
my
mother
did
in
my
infancy
---
only
with
this
difference
,
that
he
is
a
worse
subject
than
my
mother
,
if
possible
.
 
<EOS>
What
did
he
do
before
he
went
?
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
;
"
Mr
Bounderby
,
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
gave
a
beat
upon
the
crown
at
every
little
division
of
his
sentences
,
as
if
it
were
a
tambourine
;
"
to
his
being
seen
---
night
after
night
---
watching
the
Bank
?
---
to
his
lurking
about
there
---
after
dark
?
---
To
its
striking
Mrs
Sparsit
---
that
he
could
be
lurking
for
no
good
---
<EOS>
To
her
calling
Bitzer
's
attention
to
him
,
and
their
both
taking
notice
of
him
---
<EOS>
And
to
its
appearing
on
inquiry
to
-
day
---
that
he
was
also
noticed
by
the
neighbours
?
"
 
<EOS>
Having
come
to
the
climax
,
Mr
Bounderby
,
like
an
oriental
dancer
,
put
his
tambourine
on
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
Suspicious
,
"
said
James
Harthouse
,
"
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
,
sir
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
with
a
defiant
nod
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
are
more
of
'em
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
an
old
woman
.
 
<EOS>
One
never
hears
of
these
things
till
the
mischief
's
done
;
all
sorts
of
defects
are
found
out
in
the
stable
door
after
the
horse
is
stolen
;
there
's
an
old
woman
turns
up
now
.
 
<EOS>
An
old
woman
who
seems
to
have
been
flying
into
town
on
a
broomstick
,
every
now
and
then
.
 
<EOS>
She
watches
the
place
a
whole
day
before
this
fellow
begins
,
and
on
the
night
when
you
saw
him
,
she
steals
away
with
him
and
holds
a
council
with
him
---
I
suppose
,
to
make
her
report
on
going
off
duty
,
and
be
damned
to
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
such
a
person
in
the
room
that
night
,
and
she
shrunk
from
observation
,
thought
Louisa
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
not
all
of
'em
,
even
as
we
already
know
'
em
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
with
many
nods
of
hidden
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
said
enough
for
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
have
the
goodness
to
keep
it
quiet
,
and
mention
it
to
no
one
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
take
time
,
but
we
shall
have
'em
.
<EOS>
It
's
policy
to
give
'em
line
enough
,
and
there
's
no
objection
to
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
they
will
be
punished
with
the
utmost
rigour
of
the
law
,
as
notice
-
boards
observe
,
"
replied
James
Harthouse
,
"
and
serve
them
right
.
 
<EOS>
Fellows
who
go
in
for
Banks
must
take
the
consequences
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
were
no
consequences
,
we
should
all
go
in
for
Banks
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
had
gently
taken
Louisa
's
parasol
from
her
hand
,
and
had
put
it
up
for
her
;
and
she
walked
under
its
shade
,
though
the
sun
did
not
shine
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
the
present
,
Loo
Bounderby
,
"
said
her
husband
,
"
here
's
Mrs
Sparsit
to
look
after
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
's
nerves
have
been
acted
upon
by
this
business
,
and
she
'll
stay
here
a
day
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
So
make
her
comfortable
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
very
much
,
sir
,
"
that
discreet
lady
observed
,
"
but
pray
do
not
let
My
comfort
be
a
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
Anything
will
do
for
Me
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
soon
appeared
that
if
Mrs
Sparsit
had
a
failing
in
her
association
with
that
domestic
establishment
,
it
was
that
she
was
so
excessively
regardless
of
herself
and
regardful
of
others
,
as
to
be
a
nuisance
.
 
<EOS>
On
being
shown
her
chamber
,
she
was
so
dreadfully
sensible
of
its
comforts
as
to
suggest
the
inference
that
she
would
have
preferred
to
pass
the
night
on
the
mangle
in
the
laundry
.
<EOS>
True
,
the
Powlers
and
the
Scadgerses
were
accustomed
to
splendour
,
"
but
it
is
my
duty
to
remember
,
"
Mrs
Sparsit
was
fond
of
observing
with
a
lofty
grace
:
 
particularly
when
any
of
the
domestics
were
present
,
"
that
what
I
was
,
I
am
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
"
said
she
,
"
if
I
could
altogether
cancel
the
remembrance
that
Mr
Sparsit
was
a
Powler
,
or
that
I
myself
am
related
to
the
Scadgers
family
;
or
if
I
could
even
revoke
the
fact
,
and
make
myself
a
person
of
common
descent
and
ordinary
connexions
;
I
would
gladly
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
think
it
,
under
existing
circumstances
,
right
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
same
Hermitical
state
of
mind
led
to
her
renunciation
of
made
dishes
and
wines
at
dinner
,
until
fairly
commanded
by
Mr
Bounderby
to
take
them
;
when
she
said
,
"
Indeed
you
are
very
good
,
sir
;
"
and
departed
from
a
resolution
of
which
she
had
made
rather
formal
and
public
announcement
,
to
"
wait
for
the
simple
mutton
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
was
likewise
deeply
apologetic
for
wanting
the
salt
;
and
,
feeling
amiably
bound
to
bear
out
Mr
Bounderby
to
the
fullest
extent
in
the
testimony
he
had
borne
to
her
nerves
,
occasionally
sat
back
in
her
chair
and
silently
wept
;
at
which
periods
a
tear
of
large
dimensions
,
like
a
crystal
ear
-
ring
,
might
be
observed
(
or
rather
,
must
be
,
for
it
insisted
on
public
notice
)
sliding
down
her
Roman
nose
.
   
<EOS>
But
Mrs
Sparsit
's
greatest
point
,
first
and
last
,
was
her
determination
to
pity
Mr
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
occasions
when
in
looking
at
him
she
was
involuntarily
moved
to
shake
her
head
,
as
who
would
say
,
"
Alas
,
poor
Yorick
!
"
 
<EOS>
After
allowing
herself
to
be
betrayed
into
these
evidences
of
emotion
,
she
would
force
a
lambent
brightness
,
and
would
be
fitfully
cheerful
,
and
would
say
,
"
You
have
still
good
spirits
,
sir
,
I
am
thankful
to
find
;
"
and
would
appear
to
hail
it
as
a
blessed
dispensation
that
Mr
Bounderby
bore
up
as
he
did
.
 
<EOS>
One
idiosyncrasy
for
which
she
often
apologized
<EOS>
,
she
found
it
excessively
difficult
to
conquer
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
a
curious
propensity
to
call
Mrs
Bounderby
"
Miss
Gradgrind
,
"
and
yielded
to
it
some
three
or
four
score
times
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Her
repetition
of
this
mistake
covered
Mrs
Sparsit
with
modest
confusion
;
but
indeed
,
she
said
,
it
seemed
so
natural
to
say
Miss
Gradgrind
:
 
whereas
,
to
persuade
herself
that
the
young
lady
whom
she
had
had
the
happiness
of
knowing
from
a
child
could
be
really
and
truly
<EOS>
Mrs
Bounderby
,
she
found
almost
impossible
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
further
singularity
of
this
remarkable
case
,
that
the
more
she
thought
about
it
,
the
more
impossible
it
appeared
;
"
the
differences
,
"
she
observed
,
"
being
such
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
In
the
drawing
-
room
after
dinner
,
Mr
Bounderby
tried
the
case
of
the
robbery
,
examined
the
witnesses
,
made
notes
of
the
evidence
,
found
the
suspected
persons
guilty
,
and
sentenced
them
to
the
extreme
punishment
of
the
law
.
 
<EOS>
That
done
,
Bitzer
was
dismissed
to
town
with
instructions
to
recommend
Tom
to
come
home
by
the
mail
-
train
.
   
<EOS>
When
candles
were
brought
,
Mrs
Sparsit
murmured
,
"
Do
n't
be
low
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
let
me
see
you
cheerful
,
sir
,
as
I
used
to
do
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
,
upon
whom
these
consolations
had
begun
to
produce
the
effect
of
making
him
,
in
a
bull
-
headed
blundering
way
,
sentimental
,
sighed
like
some
large
sea
-
animal
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
bear
to
see
you
<EOS>
so
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Try
a
hand
at
backgammon
,
sir
,
as
you
used
to
do
when
I
had
the
honour
of
living
under
your
roof
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
played
backgammon
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
,
"
since
that
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
soothingly
,
"
I
am
aware
that
you
have
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
that
Miss
Gradgrind
takes
no
interest
in
the
game
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
shall
be
happy
,
sir
,
if
you
will
condescend
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
played
near
a
window
,
opening
on
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
fine
night
:
 
not
moonlight
,
but
sultry
and
fragrant
.
 
<EOS>
Louisa
and
Mr
Harthouse
strolled
out
into
the
garden
,
where
their
voices
could
be
heard
in
the
stillness
,
though
not
what
they
said
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
,
from
her
place
at
the
backgammon
board
,
was
constantly
straining
her
eyes
to
pierce
the
shadows
without
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
,
ma'am
?
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
;
"
you
do
n't
see
a
Fire
,
do
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
<EOS>
no
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
I
was
thinking
of
the
dew
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
got
to
do
with
the
dew
,
ma'am
?
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
myself
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
I
am
fearful
of
Miss
Gradgrind
's
taking
cold
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
She
never
takes
cold
,
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
Really
,
sir
?
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
.
 
<EOS>
And
was
affected
with
a
cough
in
her
throat
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
time
drew
near
for
retiring
,
Mr
Bounderby
took
a
glass
of
water
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
sir
?
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
your
sherry
warm
,
with
lemon
-
peel
and
nutmeg
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
have
got
out
of
the
habit
of
taking
it
now
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
more
's
the
pity
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
;
"
you
are
losing
all
your
good
old
habits
.
 
<EOS>
Cheer
up
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
If
Miss
Gradgrind
will
permit
me
,
I
will
offer
to
make
it
for
you
,
as
I
have
often
done
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Gradgrind
readily
permitting
Mrs
Sparsit
to
do
anything
she
pleased
,
that
considerate
lady
made
the
beverage
,
and
handed
it
to
Mr
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
do
you
good
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
warm
your
heart
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
sort
of
thing
you
want
,
and
ought
to
take
,
sir
.
"
<EOS>
And
when
Mr
Bounderby
said
,
"
Your
health
,
ma'am
!
"
<EOS>
she
answered
with
great
feeling
,
"
Thank
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
The
same
to
you
,
and
happiness
also
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Finally
,
she
wished
him
good
night
,
with
great
pathos
;
and
Mr
Bounderby
went
to
bed
,
with
a
maudlin
persuasion
that
he
had
been
crossed
in
something
tender
,
though
he
could
not
,
for
his
life
,
have
mentioned
what
it
was
.
   
<EOS>
Long
after
Louisa
had
undressed
and
lain
down
,
she
watched
and
waited
for
her
brother
's
coming
home
.
 
<EOS>
That
could
hardly
be
,
she
knew
,
until
an
hour
past
midnight
;
but
in
the
country
silence
,
which
did
anything
but
calm
the
trouble
of
her
thoughts
,
<EOS>
time
lagged
wearily
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
when
the
darkness
and
stillness
had
seemed
for
hours
to
thicken
one
another
,
she
heard
the
bell
at
the
gate
.
 
<EOS>
She
felt
as
though
she
would
have
been
glad
that
it
rang
on
until
daylight
;
but
it
ceased
,
and
the
circles
of
its
last
sound
spread
out
fainter
and
wider
in
the
air
,
and
all
was
dead
again
.
   
<EOS>
She
waited
yet
some
quarter
of
an
hour
,
as
she
judged
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
arose
,
put
on
a
loose
robe
,
and
went
out
of
her
room
in
the
dark
,
and
up
the
staircase
to
her
brother
's
room
.
 
<EOS>
His
door
being
shut
,
she
softly
opened
it
and
spoke
to
him
,
approaching
his
bed
with
a
noiseless
step
.
   
<EOS>
She
kneeled
down
beside
it
,
passed
her
arm
over
his
neck
,
and
drew
his
face
to
hers
.
 
<EOS>
She
knew
that
he
only
feigned
to
be
asleep
,
but
she
said
nothing
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
started
by
and
by
as
if
he
were
just
then
awakened
,
and
asked
who
that
was
,
and
what
was
the
matter
?
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
have
you
anything
to
tell
me
?
 
<EOS>
If
ever
you
loved
me
in
your
life
,
and
have
anything
concealed
from
every
one
besides
,
tell
it
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
,
Loo
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
been
dreaming
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
brother
:
"
she
laid
her
head
down
on
his
pillow
,
and
her
hair
flowed
over
him
as
if
she
would
hide
him
from
every
one
but
herself
:
 
<EOS>
"
is
there
nothing
that
you
have
to
tell
me
?
 
<EOS>
Is
there
nothing
you
can
tell
me
if
you
will
?
 
<EOS>
You
can
tell
me
nothing
that
will
change
me
.
 
<EOS>
O
Tom
,
tell
me
the
truth

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean

<EOS>
"
As
you
lie
here
alone
,
my
dear
,
in
the
melancholy
night
,
so
you
must
lie
somewhere
one
night
,
when
even
I
,
if
I
am
living
then
,
shall
have
left
you
.
 
<EOS>
As
I
am
here
beside
you
,
barefoot
,
unclothed
,
undistinguishable
in
darkness
,
so
must
I
lie
through
all
the
night
of
my
decay
,
until
I
am
dust
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
name
of
that
time
,
Tom
,
tell
me
the
truth
now
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
you
want
to
know
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
certain
;
"
in
the
energy
of
her
love
she
took
him
to
her
bosom
as
if
he
were
a
child
;
"
that
I
will
not
reproach
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
be
certain
that
I
will
be
compassionate
and
true
to
you

<EOS>
You
may
be
certain
that
I
will
save
you
at
whatever
cost

<EOS>
O
Tom
,
have
you
nothing
to
tell
me
?
 
<EOS>
Whisper
very
softly
.
 
<EOS>
Say
only
"
yes
,
"
and
I
shall
understand
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
turned
her
ear
to
his
lips
,
but
he
remained
doggedly
silent
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
word
,
Tom
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
say
<EOS>
Yes
,
or
how
can
I
say
No

when
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean

<EOS>
Loo

you

brave

kind

begin

think
of
a
better

But
I
have
nothing
more

<EOS>
Go
to
bed

go
to
bed

"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
tired

"
she
whispered
presently
,
more
in
her
usual
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
quite
tired
out

<EOS>
"
You

hurried

Tom
,
have
you
said
to
any
one
that
we
made
a
visit
to
those
people
,
and
that
we
saw
those
three
together
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
Did
n't
you
yourself
particularly
ask
me
to
keep
it
quiet
when
you
asked
me
to
go
there
with
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
did
not
know
then
what
was
going
to
happen
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
I
neither
.
 
<EOS>
How
could
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
very
quick
upon
her
with
this
retort
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ought
I
to
say
,
after
what
has
happened
,
"
said
his
sister
,
standing
by
the
bed
---
she
had
gradually
withdrawn
herself
and
risen
,
"
that
I
made
that
visit
?
 
<EOS>
Should
I
say
so
?
 
<EOS>
Must
I
say
so
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
Heavens
,
Loo
,
"
returned
her
brother
,
"
you
are
not
in
the
habit
of
asking
my
advice
.
<EOS>
say
what
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
keep
it
to
yourself
,
I
shall
keep
it
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
disclose
it
,
there
's
an
end
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
too
dark
for
either
to
see
the
other
's
face
;
but
each
seemed
very
attentive
,
and
to
consider
before
speaking
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
do
you
believe
the
man
I
gave
the
money
to
,
is
really
implicated
in
this
crime
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
why
he
should
n't
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
seemed
to
me
an
honest
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Another
person
may
seem
to
you
dishonest
,
and
yet
not
be
so
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
pause
,
for
he
had
hesitated
and
stopped
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
short
,
"
resumed
Tom
,
as
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
,
"
if
you
come
to
that
,
perhaps
I
was
so
far
from
being
altogether
in
his
favour
,
that
I
took
him
outside
the
door
to
tell
him
quietly
,
that
I
thought
he
might
consider
himself
very
well
off
to
get
such
a
windfall
as
he
had
got
from
my
sister
,
and
that
I
hoped
he
would
make
good
use
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
remember
whether
I
took
him
out
or
not
.
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
against
the
man
;
he
may
be
a
very
good
fellow
,
for
anything
I
know
<EOS>
;
I
hope
he
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Was
he
offended
by
what
you
said
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
he
took
it
pretty
well
;
he
was
civil
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Where
are
you
,
Loo
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
sat
up
in
bed
and
kissed
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
my
dear
,
good
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
nothing
more
to
tell
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
What
should
I
have
?
 
<EOS>
You
would
n't
have
me
tell
you
a
lie
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
have
you
do
that
to
-
night
,
<EOS>
Tom
,
of
all
the
nights
in
your
life
;
many
and
much
happier
as
I
hope
they
will
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
my
dear
Loo
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
so
tired
,
that
I
am
sure
I
wonder
I
do
n't
say
anything
to
get
to
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
Go
to
bed
,
go
to
bed
.
"
   
<EOS>
Kissing
her
again
,
he
turned
round
,
drew
the
coverlet
over
his
head
,
and
lay
as
still
as
if
that
time
had
come
by
which
she
had
adjured
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
stood
for
some
time
at
the
bedside
before
she
slowly
moved
away
.
 
<EOS>
She
stopped
at
the
door
,
looked
back
when
she
had
opened
it
,
and
asked
him
if
he
had
called
her
?
 
<EOS>
But
he
lay
still
,
and
she
softly
closed
the
door
and
returned
to
her
room
.
   
<EOS>
Then
the
wretched
boy
looked
cautiously
up
and
found
her
gone
,
crept
out
of
bed
,
fastened
his
door
,
and
threw
himself
upon
his
pillow
again
:
 
tearing
his
hair
,
morosely
crying
,
grudgingly
loving
her
,
hatefully
but
impenitently
spurning
himself
,
and
no
less
hatefully
and
unprofitably
spurning
all
the
good
in
the
world
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
09
.
<EOS>
Hearing
the
Last
of
it
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
,
lying
by
to
recover
the
tone
of
her
nerves
in
Mr
Bounderby
's
retreat
,
kept
such
a
sharp
look
-
out
,
night
and
day
,
under
her
Coriolanian
eyebrows
,
that
her
eyes
,
like
a
couple
of
lighthouses
on
an
iron
-
bound
coast
,
might
have
warned
all
prudent
mariners
from
that
bold
rock
her
Roman
nose
and
the
dark
and
craggy
region
in
its
neighbourhood
,
but
for
the
placidity
of
her
manner
.
<EOS>
Although
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
her
retiring
for
the
night
could
be
anything
but
a
form
,
so
severely
wide
awake
were
those
classical
eyes
of
hers
,
and
so
impossible
did
it
seem
that
her
rigid
nose
could
yield
to
any
relaxing
influence
,
yet
her
manner
of
sitting
,
smoothing
her
uncomfortable
,
not
to
say
,
gritty
mittens
<EOS>
(
they
were
constructed
of
a
cool
fabric
like
a
meat
-
safe
)
,
or
of
ambling
to
unknown
places
of
destination
with
her
foot
in
her
cotton
stirrup
,
was
so
perfectly
serene
,
that
most
observers
would
have
been
constrained
to
suppose
her
a
dove
,
embodied
by
some
freak
of
nature
,
in
the
earthly
tabernacle
of
a
bird
of
the
hook
-
beaked
order
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
a
most
wonderful
woman
for
prowling
about
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
How
she
got
from
story
to
story
was
a
mystery
beyond
solution
.
 
<EOS>
A
lady
so
decorous
in
herself
,
and
so
highly
connected
,
was
not
to
be
suspected
of
dropping
over
the
banisters
or
sliding
down
them
,
yet
her
extraordinary
facility
of
locomotion
suggested
the
wild
idea
.
<EOS>
Another
noticeable
circumstance
in
Mrs
Sparsit
was
,
that
she
was
never
hurried
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
shoot
with
consummate
velocity
from
the
roof
to
the
hall
,
yet
would
be
in
full
possession
of
her
breath
and
dignity
on
the
moment
of
her
arrival
there
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
was
she
ever
seen
by
human
vision
to
go
at
a
great
pace
.
   
<EOS>
She
took
very
kindly
to
Mr
Harthouse
,
and
had
some
pleasant
conversation
with
him
soon
after
her
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
She
made
him
her
stately
curtsey
in
the
garden
,
one
morning
before
breakfast
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
appears
but
yesterday
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
that
I
had
the
honour
of
receiving
you
at
the
Bank
,
when
you
were
so
good
as
to
wish
to
be
made
acquainted
with
Mr
Bounderby
's
address
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
An
occasion
,
I
am
sure
,
not
to
be
forgotten
by
myself
in
the
course
of
Ages
,
"
said
Mr
Harthouse
,
inclining
his
head
to
Mrs
Sparsit
with
the
most
indolent
of
all
possible
airs
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
live
in
a
singular
world
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
the
honour
,
by
a
coincidence
of
which
I
am
proud
,
to
have
made
a
remark
,
similar
in
effect
,
though
not
so
epigrammatically
expressed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
singular
world
,
I
would
say
,
sir
,
"
pursued
Mrs
Sparsit
;
after
acknowledging
the
compliment
with
a
drooping
of
her
dark
eyebrows
,
not
altogether
so
mild
in
its
expression
as
her
voice
was
in
its
dulcet
tones
;
"
as
regards
the
intimacies
we
form
at
one
time
,
with
individuals
<EOS>
we
were
quite
ignorant
of
,
at
another
.
 
<EOS>
I
recall
,
sir
,
that
on
that
occasion
you
went
so
far
as
to
say
you
were
actually
apprehensive
of
Miss
Gradgrind
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
memory
does
me
more
honour
than
my
insignificance
deserves
.
<EOS>
I
availed
myself
of
your
obliging
hints
to
correct
my
timidity
,
and
it
is
unnecessary
to
add
that
they
were
perfectly
accurate
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
's
talent
for
---
in
fact
for
anything
requiring
accuracy
---
with
a
combination
of
strength
of
mind
---
and
Family
---
is
too
habitually
developed
to
admit
of
any
question
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
was
almost
falling
asleep
over
this
compliment
;
it
took
him
so
long
to
get
through
,
and
his
mind
wandered
so
much
in
the
course
of
its
execution
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
found
Miss
Gradgrind
<EOS>
---
I
really
can
not
call
her
<EOS>
Mrs
Bounderby
;
it
's
very
absurd
of
me
---
as
youthful
as
I
described
her
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Mrs
Sparsit
,
sweetly
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
drew
her
portrait
perfectly
,
"
said
Mr
Harthouse
.
 
<EOS>
"
Presented
her
dead
image
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
engaging
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
causing
her
mittens
slowly
to
revolve
over
one
another
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Highly
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
used
to
be
considered
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
that
Miss
Gradgrind
was
wanting
in
animation
,
but
I
confess
she
appears
to
me
considerably
and
strikingly
improved
in
that
respect
.
 
<EOS>
Ay
,
and
indeed
here
is
Mr
Bounderby
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs
Sparsit
,
nodding
her
head
a
great
many
times
,
as
if
she
had
been
talking
and
thinking
of
no
one
else
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
find
yourself
this
morning
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
Pray
let
us
see
you
cheerful
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Now
,
these
persistent
assuagements
of
his
misery
,
and
lightenings
of
his
load
,
had
by
this
time
begun
to
have
the
effect
of
making
Mr
Bounderby
softer
than
usual
towards
Mrs
Sparsit
,
and
harder
than
usual
to
most
other
people
from
his
wife
downward
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
when
Mrs
Sparsit
said
with
forced
lightness
of
heart
,
"
You
want
your
breakfast
,
sir
,
but
I
dare
say
Miss
Gradgrind
will
soon
be
here
to
preside
at
the
table
,
"
Mr
Bounderby
replied
,
"
If
I
waited
to
be
taken
care
of
by
my
wife
,
ma'am
,
I
believe
you
know
<EOS>
pretty
well
I
should
wait
till
Doomsday
,
so
I
'll
trouble
you
to
take
charge
of
the
teapot
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
complied
,
and
assumed
her
old
position
at
table
.
   
<EOS>
This
again
made
the
excellent
woman
vastly
sentimental
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
so
humble
withal
,
that
when
Louisa
appeared
,
she
rose
,
protesting
she
never
could
think
of
sitting
in
that
place
under
existing
circumstances
,
often
as
she
had
had
the
honour
of
making
Mr
Bounderby
's
breakfast
,
before
Mrs
Gradgrind
<EOS>
---
she
begged
pardon
,
she
meant
to
say
Miss
Bounderby
<EOS>
---
she
hoped
to
be
excused
,
but
she
really
could
not
get
it
right
yet
,
though
she
trusted
to
become
familiar
with
it
by
and
by
---
had
assumed
her
present
position
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
only
(
she
observed
)
because
Miss
Gradgrind
happened
to
be
a
little
late
,
and
Mr
Bounderby
's
time
was
so
very
precious
,
and
she
knew
it
of
old
to
be
so
essential
that
he
should
breakfast
to
the
moment
,
that
she
had
taken
the
liberty
of
complying
with
his
request
;
long
as
his
will
had
been
a
law
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
There
!
 
<EOS>
Stop
where
you
are
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
,
"
stop
where
you
are
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Bounderby
will
be
very
glad
to
be
relieved
of
the
trouble
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Do
n't
say
that
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
,
almost
with
severity
,
"
because
that
is
very
unkind
to
Mrs
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
And
to
be
unkind
is
not
to
be
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
set
your
mind
at
rest
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
---
You
can
take
it
very
quietly
,
ca
n't
you
,
Loo
?
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
,
in
a
blustering
way
to
his
wife
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
of
no
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
it
be
of
any
importance
to
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
should
it
be
of
any
importance
to
any
one
,
Mrs
Sparsit
,
ma'am
?
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
,
swelling
with
a
sense
of
slight
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
attach
too
much
importance
to
these
things
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
By
George
,
you
'll
be
corrupted
in
some
of
your
notions
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
old
-
fashioned
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
behind
Tom
Gradgrind
's
children
's
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
with
you
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Louisa
,
coldly
surprised
.
<EOS>
"
What
has
given
you
offence
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Offence
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
suppose
if
there
was
any
offence
given
me
,
I
should
n't
name
it
,
and
request
to
have
it
corrected
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
straightforward
man
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
go
beating
about
for
side
-
winds
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
no
one
ever
had
occasion
to
think
you
too
diffident
,
or
too
delicate
,
"
Louisa
answered
him
composedly
:
 
"
I
have
never
made
that
objection
to
you
,
either
as
a
child
or
as
a
woman
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
understand
what
you
would
have
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Have
?
"
returned
Mr
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Otherwise
,
do
n't
you
,
Loo
Bounderby
,
know
thoroughly
well
that
I
,
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
,
would
have
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
,
as
he
struck
the
table
and
made
the
teacups
ring
,
with
a
proud
colour
in
her
face
that
was
a
new
change
,
Mr
Harthouse
thought
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
incomprehensible
this
morning
,
"
said
Louisa
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
take
no
further
trouble
to
explain
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
curious

know
your
meaning

<EOS>
What
does
it
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
Nothing
more
was
said
on
this
theme
,
and
Mr
Harthouse
was
soon
idly
gay
on
indifferent
subjects
.
 
<EOS>
But
from
this
day
,
the
Sparsit
action
upon
Mr
Bounderby
threw
Louisa
and
James
Harthouse
more
together
,
and
strengthened
the
dangerous
alienation
from
her
husband
and
confidence
against
him
with
another
,
into
which
she
had
fallen
by
degrees
so
fine
that
she
could
not
retrace
them
if
she
tried
.
 
<EOS>
But
whether
she
ever
tried
or
no
,
lay
<EOS>
hidden
in
her
own
closed
heart
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
was
so
much
affected
on
this
particular
occasion
,
that
,
assisting
Mr
Bounderby
to
his
hat
after
breakfast
,
and
being
then
alone
with
him
in
the
hall
,
she
imprinted
a
chaste
kiss
upon
his
hand
,
murmured
"
My
benefactor
!
"
and
retired
,
overwhelmed
with
grief
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
it
is
an
indubitable
fact
,
within
the
cognizance
of
this
history
,
that
five
minutes
after
he
had
left
the
house
in
the
self
-
same
hat
,
the
same
descendant
of
the
Scadgerses
and
connexion
by
matrimony
of
the
Powlers
,
shook
her
right
-
hand
mitten
at
his
portrait
,
made
a
contemptuous
grimace
at
that
work
of
art
,
and
said
"
Serve
you
right
,
you
Noodle
,
and
I
am
glad
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
had
not
been
long
gone
,
when
Bitzer
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
Bitzer
had
come
down
by
train
,
shrieking
and
rattling
over
the
long
line
of
arches
that
bestrode
the
wild
country
of
past
and
present
coal
-
pits
,
with
an
express
from
Stone
Lodge
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
hasty
note
to
inform
Louisa
that
Mrs
Gradgrind
lay
very
ill
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
never
been
well
within
her
daughter
's
knowledge
;
but
,
she
had
declined
within
the
last
few
days
,
had
continued
sinking
all
through
the
night
,
and
was
now
as
nearly
dead
,
as
her
limited
capacity
of
being
in
any
state
that
implied
the
ghost
of
an
intention
to
get
out
of
it
,
allowed
.
   
<EOS>
Accompanied
by
the
lightest
of
porters
,
fit
colourless
servitor
at
Death
's
door
when
Mrs
Gradgrind
knocked
,
Louisa
rumbled
to
Coketown
,
over
the
coal
-
pits
past
and
present
,
and
was
whirled
into
its
smoky
jaws
.
 
<EOS>
She
dismissed
the
messenger
to
his
own
devices
,
and
rode
away
to
her
old
home
.
   
<EOS>
She
had
seldom
been
there
since
her
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
was
usually
sifting
and
sifting
at
his
parliamentary
cinder
-
heap
in
London
(
without
being
observed
to
turn
up
many
precious
articles
among
the
rubbish
)
,
and
was
still
hard
at
it
in
the
national
dust
-
yard
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mother
had
taken
it
rather
as
a
disturbance
than
otherwise
,
to
be
visited
,
as
she
reclined
upon
her
sofa
;
young
people
,
Louisa
felt
herself
all
unfit
for
;
<EOS>
Sissy
she
had
never
softened
to
again
,
since
the
night
when
the
stroller
's
child
had
raised
her
eyes
to
look
at
Mr
Bounderby
's
intended
wife
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
no
inducements
to
go
back
,
and
had
rarely
gone
.
   
<EOS>
Neither
,
as
she
approached
her
old
home
now
,
did
any
of
the
best
influences
of
old
home
descend
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
dreams
of
childhood
---
its
airy
fables
;
its
graceful
,
beautiful
,
humane
,
impossible
adornments
of
the
world
beyond
:
 
so
good
to
be
believed
in
once
,
so
good
to
be
remembered
when
outgrown
,
for
then
the
least
among
them
rises
to
the
stature
of
a
great
Charity
in
the
heart
,
suffering
little
children
to
come
into
the
midst
of
it
,
and
to
keep
with
their
pure
hands
a
garden
in
the
stony
ways
of
this
world
<EOS>
,
wherein
it
were
better
for
all
the
children
of
Adam
that
they
should
oftener
sun
themselves
,
simple
and
trustful
,
and
not
worldly
-
wise
---
what
had
she
to
do
with
these
?
 
<EOS>
Remembrances
of
how
she
had
journeyed
to
the
little
that
she
knew
,
by
the
enchanted
roads
of
what
she
and
millions
of
innocent
creatures
had
hoped
and
imagined
;
of
how
,
first
coming
upon
Reason
through
the
tender
light
of
Fancy
,
she
had
seen
it
a
beneficent
god
,
deferring
to
gods
as
great
as
itself
;
not
a
grim
Idol
,
cruel
and
cold
,
with
its
victims
bound
hand
to
foot
,
and
its
big
dumb
shape
set
up
with
a
sightless
stare
,
never
to
be
moved
by
anything
<EOS>
but
so
many
calculated
tons
of
leverage
---
what
had
she
to
do
with
these
?
 
<EOS>
Her
remembrances
of
home
and
childhood
were
remembrances
of
the
drying
up
of
every
spring
and
fountain
in
her
young
heart
as
it
gushed
out
.
 
<EOS>
The
golden
waters
were
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
flowing
for
the
fertilization
of
the
land
where
grapes
are
gathered
from
thorns
,
and
figs
from
thistles
.
   
<EOS>
She
went
,
with
a
heavy
,
hardened
kind
of
sorrow
upon
her
,
into
the
house
and
into
her
mother
's
room
.
 
<EOS>
Since
the
time
of
her
leaving
home
,
Sissy
had
lived
with
the
rest
of
the
family
on
equal
terms
.
<EOS>
Sissy
was
at
her
mother
's
side
;
and
Jane
,
her
sister
,
now
ten
or
twelve
years
old
,
was
in
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
great
trouble
before
it
could
be
made
known
to
Mrs
Gradgrind
that
her
eldest
child
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
She
reclined
,
propped
up
,
from
mere
habit
,
on
a
couch
:
 
as
nearly
in
her
old
usual
attitude
,
as
anything
so
helpless
could
be
kept
in
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
positively
refused
to
take
to
her
bed
;
on
the
ground
that
if
she
did
,
she
would
never
hear
the
last
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
Her
feeble
voice
sounded
so
far
away
in
her
bundle
of
shawls
,
and
the
sound
of
another
voice
addressing
her
seemed
to
take
such
a
long
time
in
getting
down
to
her
ears
,
that
she
might
have
been
lying
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
lady
was
nearer
Truth
than
she
ever
had
been
:
 
which
had
much
to
do
with
it
.
   
<EOS>
On
being
told
that
Mrs
Bounderby
was
there
,
she
replied
,
at
cross
-
purposes
,
that
she
had
never
called
him
by
that
name
since
he
married
Louisa
;
that
pending
her
choice
of
an
objectionable
name
,
she
had
called
him
J
;
and
that
she
could
not
at
present
depart
from
that
regulation
,
not
being
yet
provided
with
a
permanent
substitute
.
 
<EOS>
Louisa
had
sat
by
her
for
some
minutes
,
and
had
spoken
to
her
often
,
before
she
arrived
at
a
clear
understanding
who
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
She
then
seemed
to
come
to
it
all
at
once
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs
Gradgrind
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
hope
you
are
going
on
satisfactorily
to
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
all
your
father
's
doing
.
 
<EOS>
He
set
his
heart
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
ought
to
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
hear
of
you
,
mother
;
not
of
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
want
to
hear
of
me
,
my
dear
?
 
<EOS>
That
's
something
new
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
,
when
anybody
wants
to
hear
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
Not
at
all
well
,
Louisa
.
 
<EOS>
Very
faint
and
giddy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
in
pain
,
dear
mother
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
there
's
a
pain
somewhere
in
the
room
,
"
said
Mrs
Gradgrind
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
could
n't
positively
say
that
I
have
got
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
this
strange
speech
,
she
lay
silent
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
Louisa
,
holding
her
hand
,
could
feel
no
pulse
;
but
kissing
it
,
could
see
a
slight
thin
thread
of
life
in
fluttering
motion
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
very
seldom
see
your
sister
,
"
said
Mrs
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
grows
like
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
look
at
her
.
 
<EOS>
Sissy
,
bring
her
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
was
brought
,
and
stood
with
her
hand
in
her
sister
's
.
 
<EOS>
Louisa
had
observed
her
with
her
arm
round
Sissy
's
neck
,
and
she
felt
the
difference
of
this
approach
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
see
the
likeness
,
Louisa
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
think
her
like
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
---
"
   
"
Eh
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
always
say
so
,
"
Mrs
Gradgrind
cried
,
with
unexpected
quickness
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
that
reminds
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
want
to
speak
to
you
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Sissy
,
my
good
girl
,
leave
us
alone
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
Louisa
had
relinquished
the
hand
:
 
had
thought
that
her
sister
's
was
a
better
and
brighter
face
than
hers
had
ever
been
:
 
<EOS>
had
seen
in
it
,
not
without
a
rising
feeling
of
resentment
,
even
in
that
place
and
at
that
time
,
something
of
the
gentleness
of
the
other
face
in
the
room
;
the
sweet
face
with
the
trusting
eyes
,
made
paler
than
watching
and
sympathy
made
it
,
by
the
rich
dark
hair
.
   
<EOS>
Left
alone
with
her
mother
<EOS>
,
Louisa
saw
her
lying
with
an
awful
lull
upon
her
face
,
like
one
who
was
floating
away
upon
some
great
water
,
all
resistance
over
,
content
to
be
carried
down
the
stream
.
<EOS>
She
put
the
shadow
of
a
hand
to
her
lips
again
,
and
recalled
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
were
going
to
speak
to
me
,
mother
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Eh
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
to
be
sure
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
your
father
is
almost
always
away
now
,
and
therefore
I
must
write
to
him
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
About
what
,
mother
?
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
troubled
.
 
<EOS>
About
what
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
remember
,
my
dear
,
that
whenever
I
have
said
anything
,
on
any
subject
,
I
have
never
heard
the
last
of
it
:
 
and
consequently
,
that
I
have
long
left
off
saying
anything
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
hear
you
,
mother
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
,
it
was
only
by
dint
of
bending
down
to
her
ear
,
and
at
the
same
time
attentively
watching
the
lips
as
they
moved
,
that
she
could
link
such
faint
and
broken
sounds
into
any
chain
of
connexion
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
learnt
a
great
deal
,
Louisa
,
and
so
did
your
brother
.
 
<EOS>
Ologies
of
all
kinds
from
morning
to
night
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
is
any
Ology
left
,
of
any
description
,
that
has
not
been
worn
to
rags
in
this
house
,
all
I
can
say
is
,
I
hope
I
shall
never
hear
its
name
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
hear
you
,
mother
,
when
you
have
strength
to
go
on
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
,
to
keep
her
from
floating
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
there
is
something
---
not
an
Ology
at
all
---
that
your
father
has
missed
,
or
forgotten
,
Louisa
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
sat
with
Sissy
near
me
,
and
thought
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
get
its
name
now
.
 
<EOS>
But
your
father
may
.
 
<EOS>
It
makes
me
restless
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
write
to
him
,
to
find
out
for
God
's
sake
,
what
it
is
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
a
pen
,
give
me
a
pen
.
"
   
<EOS>
Even
the
power
of
restlessness
was
gone
,
except
from
the
poor
head
,
which
could
just
turn
from
side
to
side
.
   
<EOS>
She
fancied
,
however
,
that
her
request
had
been
complied
with
,
and
that
the
pen
she
could
not
have
held
was
in
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
matters
little
what
figures
of
wonderful
no
-
meaning
she
began
to
trace
upon
her
wrappers
.
 
<EOS>
The
hand
soon
stopped
in
the
midst
of
them
;
the
light
that
had
always
been
feeble
and
dim
behind
the
weak
transparency
,
went
out
;
and
even
Mrs
Gradgrind
,
emerged
from
the
shadow
in
which
man
walketh
and
disquieteth
himself
in
vain
,
took
upon
her
the
dread
solemnity
of
the
sages
and
patriarchs
.

Mrs
Sparsit
's
Staircase
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
's
nerves
being
slow
to
recover
their
tone
,
the
worthy
woman
made
a
stay
of
some
weeks
in
duration
at
Mr
Bounderby
's
retreat
,
where
,
notwithstanding
her
anchorite
turn
of
mind
based
upon
her
becoming
consciousness
of
her
altered
station
,
she
resigned
herself
with
noble
fortitude
to
lodging
,
as
one
may
say
,
in
clover
,
and
feeding
on
the
fat
of
the
land
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
whole
term
of
this
recess
from
the
guardianship
of
the
Bank
,
Mrs
Sparsit
was
a
pattern
of
consistency
;
continuing
to
take
such
pity
on
Mr
Bounderby
to
his
face
,
as
is
rarely
taken
on
man
,
and
to
call
his
portrait
a
Noodle
to
its
face
,
with
the
greatest
acrimony
and
contempt
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
,
having
got
it
into
his
explosive
composition
that
Mrs
Sparsit
was
a
highly
superior
woman
to
perceive
that
he
had
that
general
cross
upon
him
in
his
deserts
<EOS>
(
for
he
had
not
yet
settled
what
it
was
)
,
and
further
that
Louisa
would
have
objected
to
her
as
a
frequent
visitor
if
it
had
comported
with
his
greatness
that
she
should
object
to
anything
he
chose
to
do
,
resolved
not
to
lose
sight
of
Mrs
Sparsit
easily
.
 
<EOS>
So
when
her
nerves
were
strung
up
to
the
pitch
of
again
consuming
sweetbreads
in
solitude
,
he
said
to
her
at
the
dinner
-
table
,
on
the
day
before
her
departure
,
"
I
tell
you
what
,
ma'am
;
you
shall
come
down
here
of
a
Saturday
,
while
the
fine
weather
lasts
,
and
stay
till
Monday
.
"
 
<EOS>
To
which
Mrs
Sparsit
returned
,
in
effect
,
though
not
of
the
Mahomedan
persuasion
:
 
"
To
hear
is
to
obey
.

Now
,
Mrs
Sparsit
was
not
a
poetical
woman
;
but
she
took
an
idea
in
the
nature
of
an
allegorical
fancy
,
into
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
Much
watching
of
Louisa
,
and
much
consequent
observation
of
her
impenetrable
demeanour
,
which
keenly
whetted
and
sharpened
Mrs
Sparsit
's
edge
,
must
have
given
her
as
it
were
a
lift
,
in
the
way
of
inspiration
.
<EOS>
She
erected
in
her
mind
a
mighty
Staircase
,
with
a
dark
pit
of
shame
and
ruin
at
the
bottom
;
and
down
those
stairs
,
from
day
to
day
and
hour
to
hour
,
she
saw
Louisa
coming
.
   
<EOS>
It
became
the
business
of
Mrs
Sparsit
's
life
,
to
look
up
at
her
staircase
,
and
to
watch
Louisa
coming
down
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
slowly
,
sometimes
quickly
,
sometimes
several
steps
at
one
bout
,
sometimes
stopping
,
never
turning
back
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
had
once
turned
back
,
it
might
have
been
the
death
of
Mrs
Sparsit
in
spleen
and
grief
.
   
<EOS>
She
had
been
descending
steadily
,
to
the
day
,
and
on
the
day
,
when
Mr
Bounderby
issued
the
weekly
invitation
recorded
above
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
was
in
good
spirits
,
and
inclined
to
be
conversational
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
pray
,
sir
,
"
said
she
,
"
if
I
may
venture
to
ask
a
question
appertaining
to
any
subject
on
which
you
show
reserve
---
which
is
indeed
hardy
in
me
,
for
I
<EOS>
well
know
you
have
a
reason
for
everything
you
do
---
have
you
received
intelligence
respecting
the
robbery
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
ma'am
,
no
;
not
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Under
the
circumstances
,
I
did
n't
expect
it
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Rome
was
n't
built
in
a
day
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
true
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
shaking
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
yet
in
a
week
,
ma'am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
,
with
a
gentle
melancholy
upon
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
a
similar
manner
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
"
I
can
wait
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
If
Romulus
and
Remus
could
wait
,
Josiah
Bounderby
can
wait
.
<EOS>
They
were
better
off
in
their
youth
than
I
was
,
however
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
a
she
-
wolf
for
a
nurse
;
I
had
only
a
she
-
wolf
for
a
grandmother
.
<EOS>
She
did
n't
give
any
milk
,
ma'am
;
she
gave
bruises
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
regular
Alderney
at
that
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
sighed
and
shuddered
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
ma'am
,
"
continued
Bounderby
,
"
I
have
not
heard
anything
more
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
in
hand
,
though
;
and
young
Tom
,
who
rather
sticks
to
business
at
present
---
something
new
for
him
;
he
had
n't
the
schooling
I
had
---
is
helping
.
 
<EOS>
My
injunction
is
,
Keep
it
quiet
,
and
let
it
seem
to
blow
over
.
 
<EOS>
Do
what
you
like
under
the
rose
,
but
do
n't
give
a
sign
of
what
you
're
about
;
or
half
a
hundred
of
'em
will
combine
together
and
get
this
fellow
who
has
bolted
,
out
of
reach
for
good
.
 
<EOS>
Keep
it
quiet
,
and
the
thieves
will
grow
in
confidence
by
little
and
little
,
and
we
shall
have
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
sagacious
indeed
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
interesting
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
woman
you
mentioned
,
sir
---
"
   
"
The
old
woman
I
mentioned
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
cutting
the
matter
short
,
as
it
was
nothing
to
boast
about
,
"
is
not
laid
hold
of
;
but
,
she
may
take
her
oath
<EOS>
she
will
be
,
if
that
is
any
satisfaction
to
her
villainous
old
mind
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
ma'am
,
I
am
of
opinion
,
if
you
ask
me
my
opinion
,
that
the
less
she
is
talked
about
,
the
better
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
same
evening
,
Mrs
Sparsit
,
in
her
chamber
window
,
resting
from
her
packing
operations
,
looked
towards
her
great
staircase
and
saw
Louisa
still
descending
.
   
<EOS>
She
sat
by
Mr
Harthouse
,
in
an
alcove
in
the
garden
,
talking
very
low
;
he
stood
leaning
over
her
,
as
they
whispered
together
,
and
his
face
almost
touched
her
hair
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
not
quite
!
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
straining
her
hawk
's
eyes
to
the
utmost
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
was
too
distant
to
hear
a
word
of
their
discourse
,
or
even
to
know
that
they
were
speaking
softly
,
otherwise
than
from
the
expression
of
their
figures
;
but
what
they
said
was
this
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
recollect
the
man
,
Mr
Harthouse
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
perfectly
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
face
,
and
his
manner
,
and
what
he
said
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Perfectly
.
 
<EOS>
And
an
infinitely
dreary
person
he
appeared
to
me
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
Lengthy
and
prosy
in
the
extreme
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
knowing
to
hold
forth
,
in
the
humble
-
virtue
school
of
eloquence
;
but
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
<EOS>
I
thought
at
the
time
,
"
My
good
fellow
,
you
are
over
-
doing
this
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
It
has
been
very
difficult
to
me
to
think
ill
of
that
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Louisa
---
as
Tom
says
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Which
he
never
did
say
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
no
good
of
the
fellow
?
"
   
"
No
,
certainly
.
"
   
"
Nor
of
any
other
such
person
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
,
"
she
returned
,
with
more
of
her
first
manner
on
her
than
he
had
lately
seen
,
"
when
I
know
nothing
of
them
,
men
or
women
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Louisa
,
then
consent
to
receive
the
submissive
representation
of
your
devoted
friend
,
who
knows
something
of
several
varieties
of
his
excellent
fellow
-
creatures
---
for
excellent
they
are
,
I
am
quite
ready
to
believe
,
in
spite
of
such
little
foibles
as
always
helping
themselves
to
what
they
can
get
hold
of
.
<EOS>
This
fellow
talks
.
 
<EOS>
Well
;
every
fellow
talks
.
 
<EOS>
He
professes
morality
.
 
<EOS>
Well
;
all
sorts
of
humbugs
profess
morality
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
House
of
Commons
to
the
House
of
Correction
,
there
is
a
general
profession
of
morality
,
except
among
our
people
;
it
really
is
that
exception
which
makes
our
people
quite
reviving
.
 
<EOS>
You
saw
and
heard
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
Here
was
one
of
the
fluffy
classes
pulled
up
extremely
short
by
my
esteemed
friend
Mr
Bounderby
---
who
,
as
we
know
,
is
not
possessed
of
that
delicacy
which
would
soften
so
tight
a
hand
.
 
<EOS>
The
member
of
the
fluffy
classes
was
injured
,
exasperated
,
left
the
house
grumbling
,
met
somebody
who
proposed
to
him
to
go
in
for
some
share
in
this
Bank
business
,
went
in
,
put
something
in
his
pocket
which
had
nothing
in
it
before
,
and
relieved
his
mind
extremely
.
<EOS>
Really
he
would
have
been
an
uncommon
,
instead
of
a
common
,
fellow
,
if
he
had
not
availed
himself
of
such
an
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
Or
he
may
have
originated
it
altogether
,
if
he
had
the
cleverness
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
almost
feel
as
though
it
must
be
bad
in
me
,
"
returned
Louisa
,
after
sitting
thoughtful
awhile
,
"
to
be
so
ready
to
agree
with
you
,
and
to
be
so
lightened
in
my
heart
by
what
you
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
only
say
what
is
reasonable
;
nothing
worse
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
talked
it
over
with
my
friend
Tom
more
than
once
---
of
course
I
remain
on
terms
of
perfect
confidence
with
Tom
---
and
he
is
quite
of
my
opinion
,
and
I
am
quite
of
his
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
walk
?
"
   
<EOS>
They
strolled
away
,
among
the
lanes
beginning
to
be
indistinct
in
the
twilight
---
she
leaning
on
his
arm
---
and
she
little
thought
how
she
was
going
down
,
down
,
down
,
Mrs
Sparsit
's
staircase
.
   
<EOS>
Night
and
day
,
Mrs
Sparsit
kept
it
standing
.
 
<EOS>
When
Louisa
had
arrived
at
the
bottom
and
disappeared
in
the
gulf
,
it
might
fall
in
upon
her
if
it
would
;
but
,
until
then
,
there
it
was
to
be
,
a
Building
,
before
Mrs
Sparsit
's
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
Louisa
always
was
,
upon
it
.
   
<EOS>
And
always
gliding
down
,
down
,
down
!
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
saw
James
Harthouse
come
and
go
;
she
heard
of
him
here
and
there
;
she
saw
the
changes
of
the
face
he
had
studied
;
she
,
too
,
remarked
to
a
nicety
how
and
when
it
clouded
,
how
and
when
it
cleared
;
she
kept
her
black
eyes
wide
open
,
with
no
touch
of
pity
,
with
no
touch
of
compunction
,
all
absorbed
in
interest
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
interest
of
seeing
her
,
ever
drawing
,
with
no
hand
to
stay
her
,
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
bottom
of
this
new
Giant
's
Staircase
.
   
<EOS>
With
all
her
deference
for
Mr
Bounderby
as
contradistinguished
from
his
portrait
,
Mrs
Sparsit
had
not
the
smallest
intention
of
interrupting
the
descent
.
 
<EOS>
Eager
to
see
it
accomplished
,
and
yet
patient
,
she
waited
for
the
last
fall
,
as
for
the
ripeness
and
fulness
of
the
harvest
of
her
hopes
.
 
<EOS>
Hushed
in
expectancy
,
she
kept
her
wary
gaze
upon
the
stairs
;
and
seldom
so
much
as
darkly
shook
her
right
mitten
(
with
her
fist
in
it
)
,
at
the
figure
coming
down
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
11
.
<EOS>
Lower
and
Lower
 
<EOS>
The
figure
descended
the
great
stairs
,
steadily
,
steadily
;
always
verging
,
like
a
weight
in
deep
water
,
to
the
black
gulf
at
the
bottom
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
,
apprised
of
his
wife
's
decease
,
made
an
expedition
from
London
,
and
buried
her
in
a
business
-
like
manner
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
returned
with
promptitude
to
the
national
cinder
-
heap
,
and
resumed
his
sifting
for
the
odds
and
ends
he
wanted
,
and
his
throwing
of
the
dust
about
into
the
eyes
of
other
people
who
wanted
other
odds
and
ends
---
in
fact
resumed
his
parliamentary
duties
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
Mrs
Sparsit
kept
unwinking
watch
and
ward
.
<EOS>
Separated
from
her
staircase
,
all
the
week
,
by
the
length
of
iron
road
dividing
Coketown
from
the
country
house
,
she
yet
maintained
her
cat
-
like
observation
of
Louisa
,
through
her
husband
,
through
her
brother
,
through
James
Harthouse
,
through
the
outsides
of
letters
and
packets
,
through
everything
animate
and
inanimate
that
at
any
time
went
near
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
foot
on
the
last
step
,
my
lady
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
apostrophizing
the
descending
figure
,
with
the
aid
of
her
threatening
mitten
,
"
and
all
your
art
shall
never
blind
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Art
or
nature
though
,
the
original
stock
of
Louisa
's
character
or
the
graft
of
circumstances
upon
it
,
---
her
curious
reserve
did
baffle
,
while
it
stimulated
,
one
as
sagacious
as
Mrs
Sparsit
.
<EOS>
There
were
times
when
Mr
James
Harthouse
was
not
sure
of
her
.
<EOS>
There
were
times
when
he
could
not
read
the
face
he
had
studied
so
long
;
and
when
this
lonely
girl
was
a
greater
mystery
to
him
,
than
any
woman
of
the
world
with
a
ring
of
satellites
to
help
her
.
   
<EOS>
So
the
time
went
on
;
until
it
happened
that
Mr
Bounderby
was
called
away
from
home
by
business
which
required
his
presence
elsewhere
,
for
three
or
four
days
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
on
a
Friday
that
he
intimated
this
to
Mrs
Sparsit
at
the
Bank
,
adding
:
 
"
But
you
'll
go
down
to
-
morrow
,
ma'am
,
all
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
go
down
just
as
if
I
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
make
no
difference
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
,
reproachfully
,
"
let
me
beg
you
not
to
say
that
.
 
<EOS>
Your
absence
will
make
a
vast
difference
to
me
,
sir
,
as
I
think
you
very
well
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ma'am
,
then
you
must
get
on
in
my
absence
as
well
as
you
can
,
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
,
not
displeased
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Bounderby
,
"
retorted
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
your
will
is
to
me
a
law
,
sir
;
otherwise
,
it
might
be
my
inclination
to
dispute
your
kind
commands
,
not
feeling
sure
that
it
will
be
quite
so
agreeable
to
Miss
Gradgrind
to
receive
me
,
as
it
ever
is
to
your
own
munificent
hospitality
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
shall
say
no
more
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
,
upon
your
invitation
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
when
I
invite
you
to
my
house
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
opening
his
eyes
,
"
I
should
hope
you
want
no
other
invitation
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
I
should
hope
not
.
 
<EOS>
Say
no
more
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
,
sir
,
I
could
see
you
gay
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
ma'am
?
"
blustered
Bounderby
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
rejoined
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
there
was
wo
nt
to
be
an
elasticity
in
you
which
I
sadly
miss
.
 
<EOS>
Be
buoyant
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
,
under
the
influence
of
this
difficult
adjuration
,
backed
up
by
her
compassionate
eye
,
could
only
scratch
his
head
in
a
feeble
and
ridiculous
manner
,
and
afterwards
assert
himself
at
a
distance
,
by
being
heard
to
bully
the
small

"
Bitzer
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
that
afternoon
,
when
her
patron
was
gone
on
his
journey
,
and
the
Bank
was
closing
,
"
present
my
compliments
to
young
Mr
Thomas
,
and
ask
him
if
he
would
step
up
and
partake
of
a
lamb
chop
and
walnut
ketchup
,
with
a
glass
of
India
ale
?
"
 
<EOS>
Young
Mr
Thomas
being
usually
ready
for
anything
in
that
way
,
returned
a
gracious
answer
,
and
followed
on
its
heels
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Thomas
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
these
plain
viands
being
on
table
<EOS>
,
I
thought
you
might
be
tempted
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
said
the
whelp
.
 
<EOS>
And
gloomily
fell
to
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
is
Mr
Harthouse
,
Mr
Tom
?
"
asked
Mrs
Sparsit
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
he
's
all
right
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
may
he
be
at
present
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
asked
in
a
light
conversational
manner
,
after
mentally
devoting
the
whelp
to
the
Furies
for
being
so
uncommunicative
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
is
shooting
in
Yorkshire
,
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sent
Loo
a
basket
half
as
big
as
a
church
,
yesterday
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
kind
of
gentleman
,
now
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
sweetly
,
"
whom
one
might
wager
to
be
a
good
shot
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Crack
,
"
said
Tom
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
long
been
a
down
-
looking
young
fellow
,
but
this
characteristic
had
so
increased
of
late
,
that
he
never
raised
his
eyes
to
any
face
for
three
seconds
together
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
consequently
had
ample
means
of
watching
his
looks
,
if
she
were
so
inclined
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Harthouse
is
a
great
favourite
of
mine
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
as
indeed
he
is
of
most
people
.
 
<EOS>
May
we
expect
to
see
him
again
shortly
,
Mr
Tom
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
expect
to
see
him
to
-
morrow
,
"
returned
the
whelp
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
news
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs
Sparsit
,
blandly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
got
an
appointment
with
him
to
meet
him
in
the
evening
at
the
station
here
,
"
said
Tom
,
"
and
I
am
going
to
dine
with
him
afterwards
<EOS>
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
not
coming
down
to
the
country
house
for
a
week
or
so
,
being
due
somewhere
else
.
 
<EOS>
At
least
,
he
says
so
;
but
I
should
n't
wonder
if
he
was
to
stop
here
over
Sunday
,
and
stray
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Which
reminds
me
!
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Would
you
remember
a
message
to
your
sister
,
Mr
Tom
,
if
I
was
to
charge
you
with
one
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
?
 
<EOS>
I
'll
try
,
"
returned
the
reluctant
whelp
,
"
if
it
is
n't
a
long
un
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
merely
my
respectful
compliments
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
and
I
fear
I
may
not
trouble
her
with
my
society
this
week
;
being
still
a
little
nervous
,
and
better
perhaps
by
my
poor
self
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
If
that
's
all
,
"
observed
Tom
,
<EOS>
"
it
would
n't
much
matter
,
even
if
I
was
to
forget
it
,
for
Loo
's
not
likely
to
think
of
you
unless
she
sees
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Having
paid
for
his
entertainment
with
this
agreeable
compliment
,
he
relapsed
into
a
hangdog
silence
until
there
was
no
more
India
ale
left
,
when
he
said
,
"
Well
,
Mrs
Sparsit
,
I
must
be
off
!
"
and
went
off
.
   
<EOS>
Next
day
,
Saturday
,
Mrs
Sparsit
sat
at
her
window
all
day
long
looking
at
the
customers
coming
in
and
out
,
watching
the
postmen
,
keeping
an
eye
on
the
general
traffic
of
the
street
,
revolving
many
things
in
her
mind
,
but
,
above
all
,
keeping
her
attention
on
her
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
The
evening
come
,
she
put
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
,
and
went
quietly
out
:
 
having
her
reasons
for
hovering
in
a
furtive
way
about
the
station
by
which
a
passenger
would
arrive
from
Yorkshire
,
and
for
preferring
to
peep
into
it
round
pillars
and
corners
,
and
out
of
ladies
'
waiting
-
room
windows
,
to
appearing
in
its
precincts
openly
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
was
in
attendance
,
and
loitered
about
until
the
expected
train
came
in
.
 
<EOS>
It
brought
no
Mr
Harthouse
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
waited
until
the
crowd
had
dispersed
,
and
the
bustle
was
over
;
and
then
referred
to
a
posted
list
of
trains
,
and
took
counsel
with
porters
.
 
<EOS>
That
done
,
he
strolled
away
idly
,
stopping
in
the
street
and
looking
up
it
and
down
it
,
and
lifting
his
hat
off
and
putting
it
on
again
,
and
yawning
and
stretching
himself
,
and
exhibiting
all
the
symptoms
of
mortal
weariness
to
be
expected
in
one
who
had
still
to
wait
until
the
next
train
should
come
in
,
an
hour
and
forty
minutes
hence
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
device
to
keep
him
out
of
the
way
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
starting
from
the
dull
office
window
whence
she
had
watched
him
last
.
 
<EOS>
"
Harthouse
is
with
his
sister
now
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
conception
of
an
inspired
moment
,
and
she
shot
off
with
her
utmost
swiftness
to
work
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
The
station
for
the
country
house
was
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
town
,
the
time
was
short
,
the
road
not
easy
;
but
she
was
so
quick
in
pouncing
on
a
disengaged
coach
,
so
quick
in
darting
out
of
it
,
producing
her
money
,
seizing
her
ticket
,
and
diving
into
the
train
,
that
she
was
borne
along
the
arches
spanning
the
land
of
coal
-
pits
past
and
present
,
as
if
she
had
been
caught
up
in
a
cloud
and
whirled
away
.
   
<EOS>
All
the
journey
,
immovable
in
the
air
though
never
left
behind
;
plain
to
the
dark
eyes
of
her
mind
,
as
the
electric
wires
which
ruled
a
colossal
strip
of
music
-
paper
out
of
the
evening
sky
,
were
plain
to
the
dark
eyes
of
her
body
;
Mrs
Sparsit
saw
her
staircase
,
with
the
figure
coming
down
.
 
<EOS>
Very
near
the
bottom
now
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
the
brink
of
the
abyss
.
   
<EOS>
An
overcast
September
evening
,
just
at
nightfall
,
saw
beneath
its
drooping
eyelids
Mrs
Sparsit
glide
out
of
her
carriage
,
pass
down
the
wooden
steps
of
the
little
station
into
a
stony
road
,
cross
it
into
a
green
lane
,
and
become
hidden
in
a
summer
-
growth
of
leaves
and
branches
.
 
<EOS>
One
or
two
late
birds
sleepily
chirping
in
their
nests
,
and
a
bat
heavily
crossing
and
recrossing
her
,
and
the
reek
of
her
own
tread
in
the
thick
dust
that
felt
like
velvet
,
were
all
Mrs
Sparsit
heard
or
saw
until
she
very
softly
closed
a
gate
.
   
<EOS>
She
went
up
to
the
house
,
keeping
within
the
shrubbery
,
and
went
round
it
,
peeping
between
the
leaves
at
the
lower
windows
.
 
<EOS>
Most
of
them
were
open
,
as
they
usually
were
in
such
warm
weather
,
but
there
were
no
lights
yet
,
and
all
was
silent
.
 
<EOS>
She
tried
the
garden
with
no
better
effect
.
 
<EOS>
She
thought
of
the
wood
,
and
stole
towards
it
,
heedless
of
long
grass
and
briers
:
 
of
worms
,
snails
,
and
slugs
,
and
all
the
creeping
things
that
be
.
 
<EOS>
With
her
dark
eyes
and
her
hook
nose
warily
in
advance
of
her
,
Mrs
Sparsit
softly
crushed
her
way
through
the
thick
undergrowth
,
so
intent
upon
her
object
that
she
probably
would
have
done
no
less
,
if
the
wood
had
been
a
wood
of
adders
.
   
<EOS>
Hark
!
   
<EOS>
The
smaller
birds
might
have
tumbled
out
of
their
nests
,
fascinated
by
the
glittering
of
Mrs
Sparsit
's
eyes
in
the
gloom
,
as
she
stopped
and
listened
.
   
<EOS>
Low
voices
close
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
His
voice
and
hers
.
 
<EOS>
The
appointment
was
a
device
to
keep
the
brother
away
!
 
<EOS>
There
they
were
yonder
,
by
the
felled
tree
.
   
<EOS>
Bending
low
among
the
dewy
grass
,
Mrs
Sparsit
advanced
closer
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
drew
herself
up
,
and
stood
behind
a
tree
,
like
Robinson
Crusoe
in
his
ambuscade
against
the
savages
;
so
near
to
them
that
at
a
spring
,
and
that
no
great
one
,
she
could
have
touched
them
both
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
there
secretly
,
and
had
not
shown
himself
at
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
come
on
horseback
,
and
must
have
passed
through
the
neighbouring
fields
;
for
his
horse
was
tied
to
the
meadow
side
of
the
fence
,
within
a
few
paces
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dearest
love
,
"
said
he
,
"
what
could
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
Knowing
<EOS>
you
were
alone
,
was
it
possible
that
I
could
stay
away
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
hang
your
head
,
to
make
yourself
the
more
attractive
;
I
do
n't
know
what
they
see
in
you
when
you
hold
it
up
,
"
thought
Mrs
Sparsit
;
"
but
you
little
think
,
my
dearest
love
,
whose
eyes
are
on
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
That
she
hung
her
head
,
was
certain
.
 
<EOS>
She
urged
him
to
go
away
,
she
commanded
him
to
go
away
;
but
she
neither
turned
her
face
to
him
,
nor
raised
it
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
it
was
remarkable
that
she
sat
as
still
as
ever
the
amiable
woman
in
ambuscade
had
seen
her
sit
,
at
any
period
in
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
Her
hands
rested
in
one
another
,
like
the
hands
of
a
statue
;
and
even
her
manner
of
speaking
was
not
hurried
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
child
,
"
said
Harthouse
;
Mrs
Sparsit
saw
with
delight
that
his
arm
embraced
her
;
"
will
you
not
bear
with
my
society
for
a
little
while
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
,
Louisa
?
   
<EOS>
"
Not
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
we
have
so
little
time
to
make
so
much
of
,
and
I
have
come
so
far
,
and
am
altogether
so
devoted
,
and
distracted
.
 
<EOS>
There
never
was
a
slave
at
once
so
devoted
and
ill
-
used
by
his
mistress
.
 
<EOS>
To
look
for
your
sunny
welcome
that
has
warmed
me
into
life
,
and
to
be
received
in
your
frozen
manner
,
is
heart
-
rending
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Am
I
to
say
again
,
that
I
must
be
left
to
myself
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
we
must
meet
,
my
dear
Louisa
.
 
<EOS>
Where
shall
we
meet
?
"
   
<EOS>
They
both
started
.
 
<EOS>
The
listener
started
,
guiltily
,
too
;
for
she
thought
there
was
another
listener
among
the
trees
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
only
rain
,
beginning
to
fall
fast
,
in
heavy
drops
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
ride
up
to
the
house
a
few
minutes
hence
,
innocently
supposing
that
its
master
is
at
home
and
will
be
charmed
to
receive
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
cruel
commands
are
implicitly
to
be
obeyed
;
though
I
am
the
most
unfortunate
fellow
in
the
world
,
I
believe
,
to
have
been
insensible
to
all
other
women
,
and
to
have
fallen
prostrate
at
last
under
the
foot
of
the
most
beautiful
,
and
the
most
engaging
,
and
the
most
imperious
.
 
<EOS>
My
dearest
Louisa
,
I
can
not
go
myself
,
or
let
you
go
,
in
this
hard
abuse
of
your
power
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
saw
him
detain
her
with
his
encircling
arm
,
and
heard
him
then
and
there
,
within
her
(
Mrs
Sparsit
's
)
greedy
hearing
,
tell
her
how
he
loved
her
,
and
how
she
was
the
stake
for
which
he
ardently
desired
to
play
away
all
that
he
had
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
The
objects
he
had
lately
pursued
,
turned
worthless
beside
her
;
such
success
as
was
almost
in
his
grasp
,
he
flung
away
from
him
like
the
dirt
it
was
,
compared
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
Its
pursuit
,
nevertheless
,
if
it
kept
him
near
her
,
or
its
renunciation
if
it
took
him
from
her
,
or
flight
if
she
shared
it
,
or
secrecy
if
she
commanded
it
,
or
any
fate
,
or
every
fate
,
all
was
alike
to
him
,
so
that
she
was
true
to
him
,
---
the
man
who
had
seen
how
cast
away
she
was
,
whom
she
had
inspired
at
their
first
meeting
with
an
admiration
,
an
interest
,
of
which
he
had
thought
himself
incapable
,
whom
she
had
received
into
her
confidence
,
who
was
devoted
to
her
and
adored
her
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
,
and
more
<EOS>
,
in
his
hurry
,
and
in
hers
,
in
the
whirl
of
her
own
gratified
malice
,
in
the
dread
of
being
discovered
,
in
the
rapidly
increasing
noise
of
heavy
rain
among
the
leaves
,
and
a
thunderstorm
rolling
up
---
Mrs
Sparsit
received
into
her
mind
,
set
off
with
such
an
unavoidable
halo
of
confusion
and
indistinctness
,
that
when
at
length
he
climbed
the
fence
and
led
his
horse
away
,
she
was
not
sure
where
they
were
to
meet
,
or
when
,
except
that
they
had
said
it
was
to
be
that
night
.
   
<EOS>
But
one
of
them
yet
remained
in
the
darkness
before
her
;
and
while
she
tracked
that
one
she
must
be
right
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
dearest
love
,
"
thought
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
you
little
think
how
well
attended
you
are
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
saw
her
out
of
the
wood
,
and
saw
her
enter
the
house
.
<EOS>
What
to
do
next
?
 
<EOS>
It
rained
now
,
in
a
sheet
of
water
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
's
white
stockings
were
of
many
colours
,
green
predominating
;
prickly
things
were
in
her
shoes
;
caterpillars
slung
themselves
,
in
hammocks
of
their
own
making
,
from
various
parts
of
her
dress
;
rills
ran
from
her
bonnet
,
and
her
Roman
nose
.
 
<EOS>
In
such
condition
,
Mrs
Sparsit
stood
hidden
in
the
density
of
the
shrubbery
,
considering
what
next
?
   
<EOS>
Lo
,
Louisa
coming
out
of
the
house
!
 
<EOS>
Hastily
cloaked
and
muffled
,
and
stealing
away
.
 
<EOS>
She
elopes
!
 
<EOS>
She
falls
from
the
lowermost
stair
,
and
is
swallowed
up
in
the
gulf
.
   
<EOS>
Indifferent
to
the
rain
,
and
moving
with
a
quick
determined
step
<EOS>
,
she
struck
into
a
side
-
path
parallel
with
the
ride
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
followed
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
,
at
but
a
short
distance
;
for
it
was
not
easy
to
keep
a
figure
in
view
going
quickly
through
the
umbrageous
darkness
.
   
<EOS>
When
she
stopped
to
close
the
side
-
gate
without
noise
,
Mrs
Sparsit
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
went
on
,
Mrs
Sparsit
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
She
went
by
the
way
Mrs
Sparsit
had
come
,
emerged
from
the
green
lane
,
crossed
the
stony
road
,
and
ascended
the
wooden
steps
to
the
railroad
.
 
<EOS>
A
train
for
Coketown
would
come
through
presently
,
Mrs
Sparsit
knew
;
so
she
understood
Coketown
to
be
her
first
place
of
destination
.
   
<EOS>
In
Mrs
Sparsit
's
limp
and
streaming
state
,
no
extensive
precautions
were
necessary
to
change
her
usual
appearance
;
but
,
she
stopped
under
the
lee
of
the
station
wall
,
tumbled
her
shawl
into
a
new
shape
,
and
put
it
on
over
her
bonnet
.
 
<EOS>
So
disguised
she
had
no
fear
of
being
recognized
when
she
followed
up
the
railroad
steps
,
and
paid
her
money
in
the
small
office
.
 
<EOS>
Louisa
sat
waiting
in
a
corner
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
sat
waiting
in
another
corner
.
 
<EOS>
Both
listened
to
the
thunder
,
which
was
loud
,
and
to
the
rain
,
as
it
washed
off
the
roof
,
and
pattered
on
the
parapets
of
the
arches
.
 
<EOS>
Two
or
three
lamps
were
rained
out
and
blown
out
;
so
,
both
saw
the
lightning
to
advantage
as
it
quivered
and
zigzagged
on
the
iron
tracks
.
   
<EOS>
The
seizure
of
the
station
with
a
fit
of
trembling
,
gradually
deepening
to
a
complaint
of
the
heart
,
announced
the
train
.
 
<EOS>
Fire
and
steam
,
and
smoke
,
and
red
light
;
a
hiss
,
a
crash
,
a
bell
,
and
a
shriek
;
Louisa
put
into
one
carriage
,
Mrs
Sparsit
put
into
another
:
 
<EOS>
the
little
station
a
desert
speck
in
the
thunderstorm
.
   
<EOS>
Though
her
teeth
chattered
in
her
head
from
wet
and
cold
,
Mrs
Sparsit
exulted
hugely
.
 
<EOS>
The
figure
had
plunged
down
the
precipice
,
and
she
felt
herself
,
as
it
were
,
attending
on
the
body
.
 
<EOS>
Could
she
,
who
had
been
so
active
in
the
getting
up
of
the
funeral
triumph
,
do
less
than
exult
?
 
<EOS>
"
She
will
be
at
Coketown
long
before
him
,
"
thought
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
though
his
horse
is
never
so
good
.
<EOS>
Where
will
she
wait
for
him
?
 
<EOS>
And
where
will
they
go
together
?
<EOS>
Patience
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
see
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
tremendous
rain
occasioned
infinite
confusion
,
when
the
train
stopped
at
its
destination
.
 
<EOS>
Gutters
and
pipes
had
burst
,
drains
had
overflowed
,
and
streets
were
under
water
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
first
instant
of
alighting
,
Mrs
Sparsit
turned
her
distracted
eyes
towards
the
waiting
coaches
,
which
were
in
great
request
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
will
get
into
one
,
"
she
considered
,
"
and
will
be
away
before
I
can
follow
in
another
.
 
<EOS>
At
all
risks
of
being
run
over
,
I
must
see
the
number
,
and
hear
the
order
given
to
the
coachman
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
,
Mrs
Sparsit
was
wrong
in
her
calculation
.
 
<EOS>
Louisa
got
into
no
coach
,
and
was
already
gone
.
 
<EOS>
The
black
eyes
kept
upon
the
railroad
-
carriage
in
which
she
had
travelled
,
settled
upon
it
a
moment
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
not
being
opened
after
several
minutes
,
Mrs
Sparsit
passed
it
and
repassed
it
,
saw
nothing
,
looked
in
,
and
found
it
empty
.
 
<EOS>
Wet
through
and
through
:
 
with
her
feet
squelching
and
squashing
in
her
shoes
whenever
she
moved
;
with
a
rash
of
rain
upon
her
classical
visage
;
with
a
bonnet
like
an
over
-
ripe
fig
;
with
all
her
clothes
spoiled
;
with
damp
impressions
of
every
button
,
string
,
and
hook
-
and
-
eye
<EOS>
she
wore
,
printed
off
upon
her
highly
connected
back
;
with
a
stagnant
verdure
on
her
general
exterior
,
such
as
accumulates
on
an
old
park
fence
in
a
mouldy
lane
;
Mrs
Sparsit
had
no
resource
but
to
burst
into
tears
of
bitterness
and
say
,
"
I
have
lost
her
!

<EOS>
Down
 
<EOS>
The
national
dustmen
,
after
entertaining
one
another
with
a
great
many
noisy
little
fights
among
themselves
,
had
dispersed
for
the
present
,
and
Mr
Gradgrind
was
at
home
for
the
vacation
.
   
<EOS>
He
sat
writing
in
the
room
with
the
deadly
statistical
clock
,
proving
something
no
doubt
---
<EOS>
probably
,
in
the
main
,
that
the
Good
Samaritan
was
a
Bad
Economist
.
 
<EOS>
The
noise
of
the
rain
did
not
disturb
him
much
;
but
it
attracted
his
attention
sufficiently
to
make
him
raise
his
head
sometimes
,
as
if
he
were
rather
remonstrating
with
the
elements
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
thundered
very
loudly
,
he
glanced
towards
Coketown
,
having
it
in
his
mind
that
some
of
the
tall
chimneys
might
be
struck
by
lightning
.
   
<EOS>
The
thunder
was
rolling
into
distance
,
and
the
rain
was
pouring
down
like
a
deluge
,
when
the
door
of
his
room
opened
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
round
the
lamp
upon
his
table
,
and
saw
,
with
amazement
,
his
eldest
daughter
.
   
<EOS>
"
Louisa
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Father
,
I
want
to
speak
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
How
strange
you
look
!
 
<EOS>
And
good
Heaven
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
wondering
more
and
more
,
"
have
you
come
here
exposed
to
this
storm
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
She
put
her
hands
to
her
dress
,
as
if
she
hardly
knew
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
Then
she
uncovered
her
head
,
and
letting
her
cloak
and
hood
fall
where
they
might
,
stood
looking
at
him
:
 
so
colourless
,
so
dishevelled
,
so
defiant
and
despairing
,
that
he
was
afraid
of
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
conjure
you
,
Louisa
,
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
dropped
into
a
chair
before
him
,
and
put
her
cold
hand
on
his
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
Father
,
you
have
trained
me
from
my
cradle
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Louisa
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
curse
the
hour
in
which
I
was
born
to
such
a
destiny
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
in
doubt
and
dread
,
<EOS>
vacantly
repeating
:
 
<EOS>
"
Curse
the
hour
?
 
<EOS>
Curse
the
hour
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
could
you
give
me
life
,
and
take
from
me
all
the
inappreciable
things
that
raise
it
from
the
state
of
conscious
death
?
 
<EOS>
Where
are
the
graces
of
my
soul
?
 
<EOS>
Where
are
the
sentiments
of
my
heart
?
 
<EOS>
What
have
you
done
,
O
father
,
what
have
you
done
,
with
the
garden
that
should
have
bloomed
once
,
in
this
great
wilderness
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
struck
herself
with
both
her
hands
upon
her
bosom
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
had
ever
been
here
,
its
ashes
alone
would
save
me
from
the
void
in
which
my
whole
life
sinks
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
mean
to
say
this
;
but
,
father
,
you
remember
the
last
time
we
conversed
in
this
room
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
had
been
so
wholly
unprepared
for
what
he
heard
now
,
that
it
was
with
difficulty
he
answered
,
"
Yes
,
Louisa
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
has
risen
to
my
lips
now
,
would
have
risen
to
my
lips
then
,
if
you
had
given
me
a
moment
's
help
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
reproach
you
,
father
.
<EOS>
What
you
have
never
nurtured
in
me
,
you
have
never
nurtured
in
yourself
;
but
O
!
<EOS>
if
you
had
only
done
so
long
ago
,
or
if
you
had
only
neglected
me
,
<EOS>
what
a
much
better
and
much
happier
creature
<EOS>
I
should
have
been
this
day
!
"
   
<EOS>
On
hearing
this
,
after
all
his
care
,
he
bowed
his
head
upon
his
hand
and
groaned
aloud
.
   
<EOS>
"
Father
,
if
you
had
known
,
when
we
were
last
together
here
,
what
even
I
feared
while
I
strove
against
it
---
as
it
has
been
my
task
from
infancy
to
strive
against
every
natural
prompting
that
has
arisen
in
my
heart
;
if
you
had
known
that
there
lingered
in
my
breast
,
sensibilities
,
affections
,
weaknesses
capable
of
being
cherished
into
strength
,
defying
all
the
calculations
ever
made
by
man
,
and
no
more
known
to
his
arithmetic
than
his
Creator
is
,
---
would
you
have
given
me
to
the
husband
whom
I
am
now
sure
that
I
hate
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
said
,
"
No
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
my
poor
child
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
have
doomed
me
,
at
any
time
,
to
the
frost
and
blight
that
have
hardened
and
spoiled
me
?
 
<EOS>
Would
you
have
robbed
me
---
for
no
one
's
enrichment
---
only
for
the
greater
desolation
of
this
world
---
of
the
immaterial
part
of
my
life
,
the
spring
and
summer
of
my
belief
,
my
refuge
from
what
is
sordid
and
bad
in
the
real
things
around
me
,
my
school
in
which
I
should
have
learned
to
be
more
humble
and
more
trusting
with
them
,
and
to
hope
in
my
little
sphere
to
make
them
better
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
no
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
Louisa

"
   
<EOS>
"
Yet
,
father
,
if
I
had
been
stone
blind
;
if
I
had
groped
my
way
by
my
sense
of
touch
,
and
had
been
free
,
while
I
knew
the
shapes
and
surfaces
of
things
,
to
exercise
my
fancy
somewhat
,
in
regard
to
them

I
should
have
been
a
million
times
wiser

happier
,
more
loving

more
contented

more
innocent

human
in
all
good
respects

I
am
with
the
eyes
I
have

Now

hear
what
I
have
come

He
moved
,
to
support
her
with
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
She
rising
as
he
did
so
<EOS>
,
they
stood
close
together
:
 
<EOS>
she
,
with
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
looking
fixedly
in
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
With
a
hunger
and
thirst
upon
me
,
father
,
which
have
never
been
for
a
moment
appeased
;
with
an
ardent
impulse
towards
some
region
where
rules
,
and
figures
,
and
definitions
were
not
quite
absolute
;
I
have
grown
up
,
battling
every
inch
of
my
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
knew
you
were
unhappy

my
child

"
   
<EOS>
"
Father
,
I
always
knew
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
strife
I
have
almost
repulsed
and
crushed
my
better
angel
into
a
demon
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
have
learned
has
left
me
doubting
,
misbelieving
,
despising
,
regretting
,
what
I
have
not
learned
;
and
my
dismal
resource
has
been
to
think
that
life
would
soon
go
by
,
and
that
nothing
in
it
could
be
worth
the
pain
and
trouble
of
a
contest
.

you
so
young

Louisa

he
said
with
pity

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
so
young
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
condition
,
father
---
for
I
show
you
now
,
without
fear
or
favour
,
the
ordinary
deadened
state
of
my
mind
as
I
know
it
<EOS>
---
you
proposed
my
husband
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
made
a
pretence
to
him
or
you
that
I
loved
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
,
<EOS>
and
,
father
,
you
knew
,
and
he
knew
,
that
I
never
did
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
not
wholly
indifferent
,
for
I
had
a
hope
of
being
pleasant
and
useful
to
Tom
.
<EOS>
I
made
that
wild
escape
into
something
visionary
,
and
have
slowly
found
out
how
wild
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
But
Tom
had
been
the
subject
of
all
the
little
tenderness
of
my
life
;
perhaps
he
became
so
because
I
knew
so
well
how
to
pity
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
matters
little
now
,
except
as
it
may
dispose
you
to
think
more
leniently
of
his
errors

As
her
father
held
her
in
his
arms
,
she
put
her
other
hand
upon
his
other
shoulder
,
and
still
looking
fixedly
in
his
face

went
on

<EOS>
"
When
I
was
irrevocably
married
,
there
rose
up
into
rebellion
against
the
tie

the
old
strife
,
made
fiercer
by
all
those
causes
of
disparity
which
arise
out
of
our
two
individual
natures
,
and
which
no
general
laws
shall
ever
rule

state

direct

strike
his
knife

secrets

my
soul

<EOS>
"
Louisa

he
said
,

said
imploringly

well
remembered
what
had
passed
between

in

former
interview

Father

chance
then
threw
into
my
way
a
new
acquaintance
;
a
man
such
as
I
had
had
no
experience
of

used
to
the
world

light

polished
,
easy
;
making
no
pretences

avowing
the
low
estimate
of
everything
,
that
I
was
half
afraid
to
form
in
secret
;
conveying
to
me
almost
immediately
,
though
I
do
n't
know
how
or
by
what
degrees
,
that
he
understood
me
,
and
read
my
thoughts
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
find
that
he
was
worse
than
I.
 
<EOS>
There
seemed
to
be
a
near
affinity
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
wondered
it
should
be
worth
his
while
,
who
cared
for
nothing
else
,
to
care
so
much
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
you
,
Louisa
!
"
   
<EOS>
Her
father
might
instinctively
have
loosened
his
hold
,
but
that
he
felt
her
strength
departing
from
her
,
and
saw
a
wild
dilating
fire
in
the
eyes
steadfastly
regarding
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
nothing
of
his
plea
for
claiming
my
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
It
matters
very
little
how
he
gained
it
.
 
<EOS>
Father
,
he
did
gain
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
you
know
of
the
story
of
my
marriage
,
he
soon
knew
,
just
as
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
Her
father
's
face
was
ashy
white
,
and
he
held
her
in
both
his
arms
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
no
worse
,
I
have
not
disgraced
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
you
ask
me
whether
I
have
loved
him
,
or
do
love
him
,
I
tell
you
plainly
,
father
,
that
it
may
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
She
took
her
hands
suddenly
from
his
shoulders
,
and
pressed
them
both
upon
her
side
;
while
in
her
face
,
not
like
itself
---
and
in
her
figure
,
drawn
up
,
resolute
to
finish
by
a
last
effort
what
she
had
to
say
---
the
feelings
long
suppressed
broke
loose
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
night
,
my
husband
being
away
,
he
has
been
with
me
,
declaring
himself
my
lover
.
 
<EOS>
This
minute
he
expects
me
,
for
I
could
release
myself
of
his
presence
by
no
other
means
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
I
am
sorry
<EOS>
,
I
do
not
know
that
I
am
ashamed
,
I
do
not
know
that
I
am
degraded
in
my
own
esteem
.
 
<EOS>
All
that
I
know
is
,
your
philosophy
and
your
teaching
will
not
save
me
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
father
,
you
have
brought
me
to
this
.
 
<EOS>
Save
me
by
some
other
means
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
tightened
his
hold
in
time
to
prevent
her
sinking
on
the
floor
,
but
she
cried
out
in
a
terrible
voice
,
"
I
shall
die
if
you
hold
me
!
<EOS>
Let
me
fall
upon
the
ground
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
laid
her
down
there
,
and
saw
the
pride
of
his
heart
and
the
triumph
of
his
system
,
lying
,
an
insensible
heap
,
at
his
feet
.

Another
Thing
Needful
 
Louisa
awoke
from
a
torpor
,
and
her
eyes
languidly
opened
on
her
old
bed
at
home
,
and
her
old
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
,
at
first
,
as
if
all
that
had
happened
since
the
days
when
these
objects
were
familiar
to
her
were
the
shadows
of
a
dream
,
but
gradually
,
as
the
objects
became
more
real
to
her
sight
,
the
events
became
more
real
to
her
mind
.
   
<EOS>
She
could
scarcely
move
her
head
for
pain
and
heaviness
,
her
eyes
were
strained
and
sore
,
and
she
was
very
weak
.
 
<EOS>
A
curious
passive
inattention
had
such
possession
of
her
,
that
the
presence
of
her
little
sister
in
the
room
did
not
attract
her
notice
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
Even
when
their
eyes
had
met
,
and
her
sister
had
approached
the
bed
,
Louisa
lay
for
minutes
looking
at
her
in
silence
,
and
suffering
her
timidly
to
hold
her
passive
hand
,
before
she
asked
:
   
"
<EOS>
When
was
I
brought
to
this
room
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Last
night
,
Louisa
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
brought
me
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sissy
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
believe
so
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Because
I
found
her
here
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
n't
come
to
my
bedside
to
wake
me
,
as
she
always
does
;
and
I
went
to
look
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
in
her
own
room
either
;
and
I
went
looking
for
her
all
over
the
house
,
until
I
found
her
here
taking
care
of
you
and
cooling
your
head
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
see
father
?
<EOS>
Sissy
said
I
was
to
tell
him
when
you
woke
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
a
beaming
face
you
have
,
Jane
!
"
said
Louisa
,
as
her
young
sister
---
timidly
still
---
bent
down
to
kiss
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
I
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
very
glad
you
think
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
it
must
be
Sissy
's
doing
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
arm
Louisa
had
begun
to
twine
around
her
neck
,
unbent
itself
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
tell
father
if
you
will
.
"
 
Then
,
staying
her
for
a
moment
,
she
said
,
"
It
was
you
who
made
my
room
so
cheerful
,
and
gave
it
this
look
of
welcome
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
Louisa
,
it
was
done
before
I
came
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
---
"
   
Louisa
turned
upon
her
pillow
,
and
heard
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
When
her
sister
had
withdrawn
,
she
turned
her
head
back
again
,
and
lay
with
her
face
towards
the
door
,
until
it
opened
and
her
father
entered
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
a
jaded
anxious
look
upon
him
,
and
his
hand
,
usually
steady
,
trembled
in
hers
.
 
<EOS>
He
sat
down
at
the
side
of
the
bed
,
tenderly
asking
how
she
was
,
and
dwelling
on
the
necessity
of
her
keeping
very
quiet
after
her
agitation
and
exposure
to
the
weather
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
spoke
in
a
subdued
and
troubled
voice
,
very
different
from
his
usual
dictatorial
manner
;
and
was
often
at
a
loss
for
words
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Louisa
.
 
<EOS>
My
poor
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
much
at
a
loss
at
that
place
,
that
he
stopped
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
He
tried
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
unfortunate
child
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
place
was
so
difficult
to
get
over
,
that
he
tried
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
hopeless
for
me
,
Louisa
,
to
endeavour
to
tell
you
how
overwhelmed
I
have
been
,
and
still
am
,
by
what
broke
upon
me
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
ground
on
which
I
stand
has
ceased
to
be
solid
under
my
feet
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
support
on
which
I
leaned
,
and
the
strength
of
which
it
seemed
,
and
still
does
seem
,
impossible
to
question
,
has
given
way
in
an
instant
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
stunned
by
these
discoveries
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
selfish
meaning
in
what
I
say
;
but
I
find
the
shock
of
what
broke
upon
me
last
night
,
to
be
very
heavy
indeed
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
could
give
him
no
comfort
herein
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
suffered
the
wreck
of
her
whole
life
upon
the
rock
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
say
,
Louisa
,
that
if
you
had
by
any
happy
chance
undeceived
me
some
time
ago
,
it
would
have
been
better
for
us
both
;
better
for
your
peace
,
and
better
for
mine
.
 
<EOS>
For
I
am
sensible
that
it
may
not
have
been
a
part
of
my
system
to
invite
any
confidence
of
that
kind
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
proved
my
---
my
system
to
myself
,
and
I
have
rigidly
administered
it
;
and
I
must
bear
the
responsibility
of
its
failures
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
entreat
you
to
believe
,
my
favourite
child
,
that
I
have
meant
to
do
right
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
said
it
earnestly
,
and
to
do
him
justice
he
had
.
 
<EOS>
In
gauging
fathomless
deeps
with
his
little
mean
excise
-
rod
,
and
in
staggering
over
the
universe
with
his
rusty
stiff
-
legged
compasses
,
he
had
meant
to
do
great
things
.
 
<EOS>
Within
the
limits
of
his
short
tether
he
had
tumbled
about
,
annihilating
the
flowers
of
existence
with
greater
singleness
of
purpose
than
many
of
the
blatant
personages
whose
company
he
kept
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
well
assured
of
what
you
say
,
father
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
have
been
your
favourite
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
have
intended
to
make
me
happy
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
blamed
you
,
and
I
never
shall
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
took
her
outstretched
hand
,
and
retained
it
in
his
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
I
have
remained
all
night
at
my
table
,
pondering
again
and
again
on
what
has
so
painfully
passed
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
consider
your
character
;
when
I
consider
that
what
has
been
known
to
me
for
hours
,
has
been
concealed
by
you
for
years
;
when
I
consider
under
what
immediate
pressure
it
has
been
forced
from
you
at
last
;
I
come
to
the
conclusion
<EOS>
that
I
can
not
but
mistrust
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
might
have
added
more
than
all
,
when
he
saw
the
face
now
looking
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
add
it
in
effect
,
perhaps
,
as
he
softly
moved
her
scattered
hair
from
her
forehead
with
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Such
little
actions
,
slight
in
another
man
,
were
very
noticeable
in
him
;
and
his
daughter
received
them
as
if
they
had
been
words
of
contrition
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
slowly
,
and
with
hesitation
,
as
well
as
with
a
wretched
sense
of
happiness
,
"
if
I
see
reason
to
mistrust
myself
for
the
past
,
Louisa
,
I
should
also
mistrust
myself
for
the
present
and
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
To
speak
unreservedly
to
you
,
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
far
from
feeling
convinced
now
,
however
differently
I
might
have
felt
only
this
time
yesterday
,
that
I
am
fit
for
the
trust
you
repose
in
me
;
that
I
know
how
to
respond
to
the
appeal
you
have
come
home
to
make
to
me
;
that
I
have
the
right
instinct
---
supposing
it
for
the
moment
to
be
some
quality
of
that
nature
---
how
to
help
you
,
and
to
set
you
right
,
my
child
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
had
turned
upon
her
pillow
,
and
lay
with
her
face
upon
her
arm
,
so
that
he
could
not
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
All
her
wildness
and
passion
had
subsided
;
but
,
though
softened
,
she
was
not
in
tears
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
was
changed
in
nothing
so
much
as
in
the
respect
that
he
would
have
been
glad
to
see
her
in
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
Some
persons
hold
,
"
he
pursued
,
still
hesitating
,
"
that
there
is
a
wisdom
of
the
Head
,
and
that
there
is
a
wisdom
of
the
Heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
supposed
so
;
but
,
as
I
have
said
,
I
mistrust
myself
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
supposed
the
head
to
be
all
-
sufficient
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
not
be
all
-
sufficient
;
how
can
I
venture
this
morning
to
say
it
is
!
 
<EOS>
If
that
other
kind
of
wisdom
should
be
what
I
have
neglected
,
and
should
be
the
instinct
that
is
wanted
,
Louisa
---
<EOS>
"
   
He
suggested
it
very
doubtfully
,
as
if
he
were
half
unwilling
to
admit
it
even
now
.
 
<EOS>
She
made
him
no
answer
,
lying
before
him
on
her
bed
,
still
half
-
dressed
,
much
as
he
had
seen
her
lying
on
the
floor
of
his
room
last
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
Louisa
,
"
and
his
hand
rested
on
her
hair
again
,
"
I
have
been
absent
from
here
,
my
dear
,
a
good
deal
of
late
;
and
though
your
sister
's
training
has
been
pursued
according
to
---
the
system
,
"
he
appeared
to
come
to
that
word
with
great
reluctance
always
,
"
it
has
necessarily
been
modified
by
daily
associations
begun
,
in
her
case
,
at
an
early
age
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
you
---
ignorantly
and
humbly
,
my
daughter
---
for
the
better
,
do
you
think
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Father
,
"
she
replied
,
without
stirring
,
"
if
any
harmony
has
been
awakened
in
her
young
breast
that
was
mute
in
mine
until
it
turned
to
discord
,
let
her
thank
Heaven
for
it
,
and
go
upon
her
happier
way
,
taking
it
as
her
greatest
blessing
that
she
has
avoided
my
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
O
my
child
,
my
child
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
in
a
forlorn
manner
,
"
I
am
an
unhappy
man
to
see
you
thus
!
 
<EOS>
What
avails
it
to
me
that
you
do
not
reproach
me
,
if
I
so
bitterly
reproach
myself
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
bent
his
head
,
and
spoke
low
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Louisa
,
I
have
a
misgiving
that
some
change
may
have
been
slowly
working
about
me
in
this
house
,
by
mere
love
and
gratitude
:
 
that
what
the
Head
had
left
undone
and
could
not
do
,
the
Heart
may
have
been
doing
silently
.
 
<EOS>
Can
it
be
so
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
made
him
no
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
too
proud
to
believe
it
,
Louisa
.
 
<EOS>
How
could
I
be
arrogant
,
and
you
before
me
!
 
<EOS>
Can
it
be
so
?
 
<EOS>
Is
it
so
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
He
looked
upon
her
once
more
,
lying
cast
away
there
;
and
without
another
word
went
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
long
gone
,
when
she
heard
a
light
tread
near
the
door
,
and
knew
that
some
one
stood
beside
her
.
   
<EOS>
She
did
not
raise
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
A
dull
anger
that
she
should
be
seen
in
her
distress
,
and
that
the
involuntary
look
she
had
so
resented
should
come
to
this
fulfilment
,
smouldered
within
her
like
an
unwholesome
fire
.
 
<EOS>
All
closely
imprisoned
forces
rend
and
destroy
.
<EOS>
The
air
that
would
be
healthful
to
the
earth
,
the
water
that
would
enrich
it
,
the
heat
that
would
ripen
it
,
tear
it
when
caged
up
.
 
<EOS>
So
in
her
bosom
even
now
;
the
strongest
qualities
she
possessed
,
long
turned
upon
themselves
,
became
a
heap
of
obduracy
,
that
rose
against
a
friend
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
well
that
soft
touch
came
upon
her
neck
,
and
that
she
understood
herself
to
be
supposed
to
have
fallen
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
The
sympathetic
hand
did
not
claim
her
resentment
.
 
<EOS>
Let
it
lie
there
,
let
it
lie
.
   
<EOS>
It
lay
there
,
warming
into
life
a
crowd
of
gentler
thoughts
;
and
she
rested
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
softened
with
the
quiet
,
and
the
consciousness
of
being
so
watched
,
some
tears
made
their
way
into
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
The
face
touched
hers
,
and
she
knew
that
there
were
tears
upon
it
too
,
and
she
the
cause
of
them
.
   
<EOS>
As
Louisa
feigned
to
rouse
herself
,
and
sat
up
,
Sissy
retired
,
so
that
she
stood
placidly
near
the
bedside
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
have
not
disturbed
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
come
to
ask
if
you
would
let
me
stay
with
you
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
stay
with
me
?
 
<EOS>
My
sister
will
miss
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
everything
to
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Am
I
?
"
returned
Sissy
,
shaking
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
be
something
to
you
,
if
I
might
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
?
<EOS>
"
said
Louisa
,
almost
sternly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Whatever
you
want
most
,
if
I
could
be
that
.
 
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
I
would
like
to
try
to
be
as
near
it
as
I
can
.
 
<EOS>
And
however
far
off
that
may
be
,
I
will
never
tire
of
trying
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
let
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
father
sent
you
to
ask
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
indeed
,
"
replied
Sissy
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
told
me
that
I
might
come
in
now
,
but
he
sent
me
away
from
the
room
this
morning
---
or
at
least
---
"
   
She
hesitated
and
stopped
.
   
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
what
?
"
said
Louisa
,
with
her
searching
eyes
upon
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
best
myself
that
I
should
be
sent
away
,
for
I
felt
very
uncertain
whether
you
would
like
to
find
me
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
I
always
hated
you
so
much
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
for
I
have
always
loved
you
,
and
have
always
wished
that
you
should
know
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
changed
to
me
a
little
,
shortly
before
you
left
home
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
I
wondered
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
knew
so
much
,
and
I
knew
so
little
,
and
it
was
so
natural
in
many
ways
,
going
as
you
were
among
other
friends
,
that
I
had
nothing
to
complain
of
,
and
was
not
at
all
hurt
.
"
   
<EOS>
Her
colour
rose
as
she
said
it
modestly
and
hurriedly
.
 
<EOS>
Louisa
understood
the
loving
pretence
,
and
her
heart
smote
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
try
?
"
said
Sissy
,
emboldened
to
raise
her
hand
to
the
neck
that
was
insensibly
drooping
towards
her
.
   
<EOS>
Louisa
,
taking
down
the
hand
that
would
have
embraced
her
in
another
moment
,
held
it
in
one
of
hers
,
and
answered
:
   
"
<EOS>
First
,
Sissy
,
do
you
know
what
I
am
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
so
proud
and
so
hardened
,
so
confused
and
troubled
,
so
resentful
and
unjust
to
every
one
and
to
myself
,
that
everything
is
stormy
,
dark
,
and
wicked
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Does
not
that
repel
you
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
unhappy
,
and
all
that
should
have
made
me
otherwise
is
so
laid
waste
,
that
if
I
had
been
bereft
of
sense
to
this
hour
,
and
instead
of
being
as
learned
as
you
think
me
,
had
to
begin
to
acquire
the
simplest
truths
,
I
could
not
want
a
guide
to
peace
,
contentment
,
honour
,
all
the
good
of
which
I
am
quite
devoid
,
more
abjectly
than
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
Does
not
that
repel
you
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
   
<EOS>
In
the
innocence
of
her
brave
affection
,
and
the
brimming
up
of
her
old
devoted
spirit
,
the
once
deserted
girl
shone
like
a
beautiful
light
upon
the
darkness
of
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
Louisa
raised
the
hand
that
it
might
clasp
her
neck
and
join
its
fellow
there
.
 
<EOS>
She
fell
upon
her
knees
,
and
clinging
to
this
stroller
's
child
looked
up
at
her
almost
with
veneration
.
   
<EOS>
"
Forgive
me
,
pity
me
,
help
me
!
 
<EOS>
Have
compassion
on
my
great
need
,
and
let
me
lay
this
head
of
mine
upon
a
loving
heart
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
lay
it
here
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sissy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lay
it
here
,
my
dear

Chapter

<EOS>
Very
Ridiculous
 
Mr
James
Harthouse
passed
a
whole
night
and
a
day
in
a
state
of
so
much
hurry
,
that
the
World
,
with
its
best
glass
in
his
eye
,
would
scarcely
have
recognized
him
during
that
insane
interval
,
as
the
brother
Jem
of
the
honourable
and
jocular
member
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
positively
agitated
.
 
<EOS>
He
several
times
spoke
with
an
emphasis
,
similar
to
the
vulgar
manner
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
in
and
went
out
in
an
unaccountable
way
,
like
a
man
without
an
object
.
 
<EOS>
He
rode
like
a
highwayman
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
he
was
so
horribly
bored
by
existing
circumstances
,
that
he
forgot
to
go
in
for
boredom
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
the
authorities
.
   
<EOS>
After
putting
his
horse
at
Coketown
through
the
storm
,
as
if
it
were
a
leap
,
he
waited
up
all
night
:
 
from
time
to
time
ringing
his
bell
with
the
greatest
fury
,
charging
the
porter
who
kept
watch
with
delinquency
in
withholding
letters
or
messages
that
could
not
fail
to
have
been
entrusted
to
him
,
and
demanding
restitution
on
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
The
dawn
coming
,
the
morning
coming
,
and
the
day
coming
,
and
neither
message
nor
letter
coming
with
either
,
he
went
down
to
the
country
house
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
the
report
was
,
Mr
Bounderby
away
,
and
Mrs
Bounderby
in
town
.
 
<EOS>
Left
for
town
suddenly
last
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Not
even
known
to
be
gone
until
receipt
of
message
,
importing
that
her
return
was
not
to
be
expected
for
the
present
.
   
<EOS>
In
these
circumstances
he
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
follow
her
to
town
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
to
the
house
in
town
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Bounderby
not
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
in
at
the
Bank
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
away
and
Mrs
Sparsit
away
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
away
?
 
<EOS>
Who
could
have
been
reduced
to
sudden
extremity
for
the
company
of
that
griffin
!
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Tom
,
who
had
his
own
reasons
for
being
uneasy
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
was
off
somewhere
at
daybreak
this
morning
.
<EOS>
She
's
always
full
of
mystery
;
I
hate
her
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
do
that
white
chap
;
he
's
always
got
his
blinking
eyes
upon
a
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
were
you
last
night
,
Tom
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
was
I
last
night
!
"
said
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
!
 
<EOS>
I
like
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
waiting
for
you
,
Mr
Harthouse
,
till
it
came
down
as
I
never
saw
it
come
down
before
.
 
<EOS>
Where
was
I
too
!
 
<EOS>
Where
were
you
,
you
mean
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
prevented
from
coming
---
detained
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Detained
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
Tom
.
 
<EOS>
"
Two
of
us
were
detained
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
detained
looking
for
you
,
till
I
lost
every
train
but
the
mail
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
a
pleasant
job
to
go
down
by
that
on
such
a
night
,
and
have
to
walk
home
through
a
pond
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
sleep
in
town
after
all
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
in
my
own
bed
at
Bounderby
's
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
see
your
sister
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
the
deuce
,
"
returned
Tom
,
staring
,
"
could
I
see
my
sister
when
she
was
fifteen
miles
off
?
"
   
<EOS>
Cursing
these
quick
retorts
of
the
young
gentleman
to
whom
he
was
so
true
<EOS>
a
friend
<EOS>
,
Mr
Harthouse
disembarrassed
himself
of
that
interview
with
the
smallest
conceivable
amount
of
ceremony
,
and
debated
for
the
hundredth
time
what
all
this
could
mean
?
 
<EOS>
He
made
only
one
thing
clear
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
,
that
whether
she
was
in
town
or
out
of
town
,
whether
he
had
been
premature
with
her
who
was
so
hard
to
comprehend
,
or
she
had
lost
courage
,
or
they
were
discovered
,
or
some
mischance
or
mistake
,
at
present
incomprehensible
,
<EOS>
had
occurred
,
he
must
remain
to
confront
his
fortune
,
whatever
it
was
.
<EOS>
The
hotel
where
he
was
known
to
live
when
condemned
to
that
region
of
blackness
,
was
the
stake
to
which
he
was
tied
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
all
the
rest
---
What
will
be
,
will
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
,
whether
I
am
waiting
for
a
hostile
message
,
or
an
assignation
,
or
a
penitent
remonstrance
,
or
an
impromptu
wrestle
with
my
friend
Bounderby
in
the
Lancashire
manner
---
which
would
seem
as
likely
as
anything
else
in
the
present
state
of
affairs
---
I
'll
dine
,
"
said
Mr
James
Harthouse
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bounderby
has
the
advantage
in
point
of
weight
;
and
if
anything
of
a
British
nature
is
to
come
off
between
us
,
it
may
be
as
well
to
be
in
training
.
"
   
<EOS>
Therefore
he
rang
the
bell
,
and
tossing
himself
negligently
on
a
sofa
,
ordered
"
Some
dinner
at
six
---
with
a
beefsteak
in
it
,
"
and
got
through
the
intervening
time
as
well
as
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
not
particularly
well
;
for
he
remained
in
the
greatest
perplexity
,
and
,
as
the
hours
went
on
,
and
no
kind
of
explanation
offered
itself
,
his
perplexity
augmented
at
compound
interest
.
   
<EOS>
However
,
he
took
affairs
as
coolly
as
it
was
in
human
nature
to
do
,
and
entertained
himself
with
the
facetious
idea
of
the
training
more
than
once
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
n't
be
bad
,
"
he
yawned
at
one
time
,
"
to
give
the
waiter
five
shillings
,
and
throw
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
another
time
it
occurred
to
him
,
"
Or
a
fellow
of
about
thirteen
or
fourteen
stone
might
be
hired
by
the
hour
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
these
jests
did
not
tell
materially
on
the
afternoon
,
or
his
suspense
;
and
,
sooth
to
say
,
they
both
lagged
fearfully
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
,
even
before
dinner
,
to
avoid
often
walking
about
in
the
pattern
of
the
carpet
,
looking
out
of
the
window
,
listening
at
the
door
for
footsteps
,
and
occasionally
becoming
rather
hot
when
any
steps
approached
that
room
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
after
dinner
,
when
the
day
turned
to
twilight
,
and
the
twilight
turned
to
night
,
and
still
no
communication
was
made
to
him
,
it
began
to
be
as
he
expressed
it
,
"
like
the
Holy
Office
and
slow
torture
.
"
 
<EOS>
However
,
still
true
to
his
conviction
that
indifference
was
the
genuine
high
-
breeding
(
the
only
conviction
he
had
)
,
he
seized
this
crisis
as
the
opportunity
for
ordering
candles
and
a
newspaper
.
   
<EOS>
He
had
been
trying
in
vain
,
for
half
an
hour
,
to
read
this
newspaper
,
when
the
waiter
appeared
and
said
,
at
once
mysteriously
and
apologetically
:
   
<EOS>
"
Beg
your
pardon
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
're
wanted
,
sir
,
if
you
please
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
general
recollection
that
this
was
the
kind
of
thing
the
Police
said
to
the
swell
mob
,
caused
Mr
Harthouse
to
ask
the
waiter
in
return
,
with
bristling
indignation
,
what
the
Devil
he
meant
by
"
wanted
"
?
   
<EOS>
"
Beg
your
pardon
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Young
lady
outside
,
sir
,
wishes
to
see
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Outside
?
 
<EOS>
Where
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Outside
this
door
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Giving
the
waiter
to
the
personage
before
mentioned
,
as
a
block
-
head
duly
qualified
for
that
consignment
,
Mr
Harthouse
hurried
into
the
gallery
.
 
<EOS>
A
young
woman
whom
he
had
never
seen
stood
there
.
 
<EOS>
Plainly
dressed
,
very
quiet
,
very
pretty
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
conducted
her
into
the
room
and
placed
a
chair
for
her
,
he
observed
,
by
the
light
of
the
candles
,
that
she
was
even
prettier
than
he
had
at
first
believed
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
was
innocent
and
youthful
,
and
its
expression
remarkably
pleasant
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
not
afraid
of
him
,
or
in
any
way
disconcerted
;
she
seemed
to
have
her
mind
entirely
preoccupied
with
the
occasion
of
her
visit
,
and
to
have
substituted
that
consideration
for
herself
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
speak
to
Mr
Harthouse
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
,
when
they
were
alone
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
Mr
Harthouse
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
added
in
his
mind
,
"
<EOS>
And
you
speak
to
him
with
the
most
confiding
eyes
I
ever
saw
,
and
the
most
earnest
voice
(
though
so
quiet
)
I
ever
heard
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
do
not
understand
---
and
I
do
not
,
sir
"
---
said
Sissy
,
"
what
your
honour
as
a
gentleman
binds
you
to

,
in
other
matters
:
"
the
blood
really
rose
in
his
face
as
she
began
in
these
words
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
may
rely
upon
it
to
keep
my
visit
secret
,
and
to
keep
secret
what
I
am
going
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
rely
upon
it
,
if
you
will
tell
me
I
may
so
far
trust
---
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
young
,
as
you
see
;
I
am
alone
,
as
you
see
.
 
<EOS>
In
coming
to
you
,
sir
,
I
have
no
advice
or
encouragement
beyond
my
own
hope
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
thought
,
"
<EOS>
But
that
is
very
strong
,
"
as
he
followed
the
momentary
upward
glance
of
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
besides
,
"
This
is
a
very
odd
beginning
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
where
we
are
going
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
said
Sissy
,
"
you
have
already
guessed
whom
I
left
just
now
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
in
the
greatest
concern
and
uneasiness
during
the
last
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
(
which
have
appeared
as
many
years
)
,
"
he
returned
,
"
on
a
lady
's
account
.
 
<EOS>
The
hopes
I
have
been
encouraged
to
form
that
you
come
from
that
lady
,
do
not
deceive
me
,
I
trust
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
left
her
within
an
hour
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
---
 
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
her
father
's
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Harthouse
's
face
lengthened
in
spite
of
his
coolness
,
and
his
perplexity
increased
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
I
certainly
,
"
he
thought
,
"
do
not
see
where
we
are
going
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
hurried
there
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
She
arrived
there
in
great
agitation
,
and
was
insensible
all
through
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
live
at
her
father
's
,
and
was
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
<EOS>
,
sir
,
you
will
never
see
her
again
as
long
as
you
live
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Harthouse
drew
a
long
breath
;
and
,
if
ever
man
found
himself
in
the
position
of
not
knowing
what
to
say
,
made
the
discovery
beyond
all
question
that
he
was
so
circumstanced
.
 
<EOS>
The
child
-
like
ingenuousness
with
which
his
visitor
spoke
,
her
modest
fearlessness
,
her
truthfulness
which
put
all
artifice
aside
,
her
entire
forgetfulness
of
herself
in
her
earnest
quiet
holding
to
the
object
with
which
she
had
come
;
all
this
,
together
with
her
reliance
on
his
easily
given
promise
---
which
in
itself
shamed
him
---
presented
something
in
which
he
was
so
inexperienced
,
and
against
which
he
knew
any
of
his
usual
weapons
would
fall
so
powerless
;
that
not
a
word
could
he
rally
to
his
relief
.
   
<EOS>
At
last
he
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
So
startling
an
announcement
,
so
confidently
made
,
and
by
such
lips
,
is
really
disconcerting
in
the
last
degree
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
be
permitted
to
inquire
,
if
you
are
charged
to
convey
that
information
to
me
in
those
hopeless
words
,
by
the
lady
of
whom
we
speak
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
charge
from
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
drowning
man
catches
at
the
straw
.
 
<EOS>
With
no
disrespect
for
your
judgment
,
and
with
no
doubt
of
your
sincerity
,
excuse
my
saying
that
I
cling
to
the
belief
that
there
is
yet
hope
that
I
am
not
condemned
to
perpetual
exile
from
that
lady
's
presence
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
not
the
least
hope
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
object
of
my
coming
here
,
sir
,
is
to
assure
you
that
you
must
believe
that
there
is
no
more
hope
of
your
ever
speaking
with
her
again
,
than
there
would
be
if
she
had
died
when
she
came
home
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Must
believe
?
 
<EOS>
But
if
I
ca
n't
---
or
if
I
should
,
by
infirmity
of
nature
,
be
obstinate
---
and
wo
n't
---
"
   
"
It
is
still
true
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
hope
.
"
   
<EOS>
James
Harthouse
looked
at
her
with
an
incredulous
smile
upon
his
lips
;
but
her
mind
looked
over
and
beyond
him
,
and
the
smile
was
quite
thrown
away
.
   
<EOS>
He
bit
his
lip
,
and
took
a
little
time
for
consideration
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
If
it
should
unhappily
appear
,
"
he
said
,
"
after
due
pains
and
duty
on
my
part
,
that
I
am
brought
to
a
position
so
desolate
as
this
banishment
<EOS>
,
I
shall
not
become
the
lady
's
persecutor
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
said
you
had
no
commission
from
her
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
only
the
commission
of
my
love
for
her
,
and
her
love
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
other
trust
,
than
that
I
have
been
with
her
since
she
came
home
,
and
that
she
has
given
me
her
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
further
trust
,
than
that
I
know
something
of
her
character
and
her
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
O
Mr
Harthouse
<EOS>
,
I
think
you
had
that
trust
too
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
touched
in
the
cavity
where
his
heart
should
have
been
---
in
that
nest
of
addled
eggs
,
where
the
birds
of
heaven
would
have
lived
if
they
had
not
been
whistled
away
---
by
the
fervour
of
this
reproach
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
a
moral
sort
of
fellow
,
"
he
said
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
never
make
any
pretensions
to
the
character
of
a
moral
sort
of
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
as
immoral
as
need
be
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
in
bringing
any
distress
upon
the
lady
who
is
the
subject
of
the
present
conversation
,
or
in
unfortunately
compromising
her
in
any
way
,
or
in
committing
myself
by
any
expression
of
sentiments
towards
her
,
not
perfectly
reconcilable
with
---
in
fact
with
---
the
domestic
hearth
;
or
in
taking
any
advantage
of
her
father
's
being
a
machine
,
or
of
her
brother
's
being
a
whelp
,
or
of
her
husband
's
being
a
bear
;
I
beg
to
be
allowed
to
assure
you
that
I
have
had
no
particularly
evil
intentions
,
but
have
glided
on
from
one
step
to
another
with
a
smoothness
so
perfectly
diabolical
,
that
I
had
not
the
slightest
idea
the
catalogue
was
half
so
long
until
I
began
to
turn
it
over
.
<EOS>
Whereas
I
find
,
"
said
Mr
James
Harthouse
,
in
conclusion
,
"
that
it
is
really
in
several
volumes
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Though
he
said
all
this
in
his
frivolous
way
,
the
way
seemed
,
for
that
once
,
a
conscious
polishing
of
but
an
ugly
surface
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
silent
for
a
moment
;
and
then
proceeded
with
a
more
self
-
possessed
air
,
though
with
traces
of
vexation
and
disappointment
that
would
not
be
polished
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
After
what
has
been
just
now
represented
to
me
,
in
a
manner
I
find
it
impossible
to
doubt
---
I
know
of
hardly
any
other
source
from
which
I
could
have
accepted
it
so
readily
---
<EOS>
I
feel
bound
to
say
to
you
,
in
whom
the
confidence
you
have
mentioned
has
been
reposed
,
that
I
can
not
refuse
to
contemplate
the
possibility
(
however
unexpected
)
of
my
seeing
the
lady
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
solely
to
blame
for
the
thing
having
come
to
this
---
and
---
and
,
I
can
not
say
,
"
he
added
,
rather
hard
up
for
a
general
peroration
,
"
that
I
have
any
sanguine
expectation
of
ever
becoming
a
moral
sort
of
fellow
,
or
that
I
have
any
belief
in
any
moral
sort
of
fellow
whatever
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Sissy
's
face
sufficiently
showed
that
her
appeal
to
him
was
not
finished
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
spoke
,
"
he
resumed
,
as
she
raised
her
eyes
to
him
again
,
"
of
your
first
object
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
assume
that
there
is
a
second
to
be
mentioned
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Will
you
oblige
me
by
confiding
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Harthouse
,
"
returned
Sissy
,
with
a
blending
of
gentleness
and
steadiness
that
quite
defeated
him
,
and
with
a
simple
confidence
in
his
being
bound
to
do
what
she
required
,
that
held
him
at
a
singular
disadvantage
,
"
the
only
reparation
that
remains
with
you
,
is
to
leave
here
immediately
and
finally
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
quite
sure
that
you
can
mitigate
in
no
other
way
the
wrong
and
harm
you
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
quite
sure
that
it
is
the
only
compensation
you
have
left
it
in
your
power
to
make
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
that
it
is
much
,
or
that
it
is
enough
;
but
it
is
something
,
and
it
is
necessary
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
though
without
any
other
authority
than
I
have
given
you
,
and
even
without
the
knowledge
of
any
other
person
than
yourself
and
myself
,
I
ask
you
to
depart
from
this
place
to
-
night
,
under
an
obligation
never
to
return
to
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
If
she
had
asserted
any
influence
over
him
beyond
her
plain
faith
in
the
truth
and
right
of
what
she
said
;
if
she
had
concealed
the
least
doubt
or
irresolution
,
or
had
harboured
for
the
best
purpose
any
reserve
or
pretence
;
if
she
had
shown
,
or
felt
,
the
lightest
trace
of
any
sensitiveness
to
his
ridicule
or
his
astonishment
,
or
any
remonstrance
he
might
offer
;
he
would
have
carried
it
against
her
at
this
point
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
could
as
easily
have
changed
a
clear
sky
by
looking
at
it
in
surprise
,
as
affect
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
do
you
know
,
"
he
asked
,
quite
at
a
loss
,
"
the
extent
of
what
you
ask
?
 
<EOS>
You
probably
are
not
aware
that
I
am
here
on
a
public
kind
of
business
,
preposterous
enough
in
itself
,
but
which
I
have
gone
in
for
,
and
sworn
by
,
and
am
supposed
to
be
devoted
to
in
quite
a
desperate
manner
?
 
<EOS>
You
probably
are
not
aware
of
that
,
but
I
assure
you
it
's
the
fact
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
had
no
effect
on
Sissy
,
fact
or
no
fact
.
   
<EOS>
"
Besides
which
,
"
said
Mr
Harthouse
,
taking
a
turn
or
two
across
the
room
,
dubiously
<EOS>
,
"
it
's
so
alarmingly
absurd
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
make
a
man
so
ridiculous
,
after
going
in
for
these
fellows
,
to
back
out
in
such
an
incomprehensible
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
sure
,
"
repeated
Sissy
,
"
that
it
is
the
only
reparation
in
your
power
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
quite
sure
,
or
I
would
not
have
come
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
glanced
at
her
face
,
and
walked
about
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
soul
,
I
do
n't
know
what
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
So
immensely
absurd
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
fell
to
his
lot
,
now
,
to
stipulate
for
secrecy
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
to
do
such
a
very
ridiculous
thing

"
he
said
,
stopping
again
presently
,
and
leaning
against
the
chimney
-
piece
,
"
it
could
only
be
in
the
most
inviolable
confidence

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
trust
to
you
,
sir

returned
Sissy
,
"
and
you
will
trust
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
leaning
against
the
chimney
-
piece
reminded
him
of
the
night
with
the
whelp
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
self
-
same
chimney
-
piece
,
and
somehow
he
felt
as
if
he
were
the
whelp
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
make
no
way
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
a
man
never
was
placed
in
a
more
ridiculous
position

he
said
,
after
looking
down
,
and
looking
up
,
and
laughing
,
and
frowning
,
and
walking
off
,
and
walking
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
see
no
way
out
of
it

<EOS>
What
will
be
,
will
be
.
 
<EOS>
This
will
be
,
I
suppose

<EOS>
I
must
take
off
myself
,
I
imagine
---
in
short
,
I
engage
to
do
it

<EOS>
Sissy
rose
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
not
surprised
by
the
result
,
but
she
was
happy
in
it
,
and
her
face
beamed
brightly
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
permit
me
to
say
,
"
continued
Mr
James
Harthouse
,
"
that
I
doubt
if
any
other
ambassador

ambassadress

could
have
addressed

success

<EOS>
I
must
not
only
regard
myself
as
being
in
a
very
ridiculous
position

as
being
vanquished
at
all
points

I
am
only
a
poor
girl

returned
Sissy

I
was
separated
from
my
father

was
only
a
stroller

taken
pity
on

I
have
lived

She
was
gone

It
wanted
this
to
complete
the
defeat

said
Mr
James
Harthouse
,
sinking
,
with
a
resigned
air
,
on
the
sofa
,
after
standing
transfixed
a
little
while
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
defeat
may
now
be
considered
perfectly
accomplished

Only
a

only

only
James

made
nothing
of

only
James
Harthouse
a
Great
Pyramid
of
failure

<EOS>
The
Great
Pyramid
put
it
into
his
head
to
go
up
the
Nile
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
a
pen
upon
the
instant
,
and
wrote
the
following
note
(
in
appropriate
hieroglyphics
)
to
his
brother
:

,
---
All
up
at
Coketown
.
 
<EOS>
Bored
out
of
the
place
,
and
going
in
for
camels
.
 
<EOS>
Affectionately
,
JEM
,
   
He
rang
the
bell
.
   
<EOS>
"
Send
my
fellow
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Gone
to
bed
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
to
get
up
,
and
pack
up
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
wrote
two
more
notes
.
 
<EOS>
One
,
to
Mr
Bounderby
,
announcing
his
retirement
from
that
part
of
the
country
,
and
showing
where
he
would
be
found
for
the
next
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
,
similar
in
effect
,
to
Mr
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
Almost
as
soon
as
the
ink
was
dry
upon
their
superscriptions
,
he
had
left
the
tall
chimneys
of
Coketown
behind
,
and
was
in
a
railway
carriage
,
tearing
and
glaring
over
the
dark
landscape
.
   
<EOS>
The
moral
sort
of
fellows
might
suppose
that
Mr
James
Harthouse
derived
some
comfortable
reflections
afterwards
,
from
this
prompt
retreat
,
as
one
of
his
few
actions
that
made
any
amends
for
anything
,
and
as
a
token
to
himself
that
he
had
escaped
the
climax
of
a
very
bad
business
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
so
,
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
A
secret
sense
of
having
failed
and
been
ridiculous
---
a
dread
of
what
other
fellows
who
went
in
for
similar
sorts
of
things
,
would
say
at
his
expense
if
they
knew
it
---
<EOS>
so
oppressed
him
,
that
what
was
about
the
very
best
passage
in
his
life
was
the
one
of
all
others
he
would
not
have
owned
to
on
any
account
,
and
the
only
one
that
made
him
ashamed
of
himself
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
03
.
<EOS>
Very
Decided
 
<EOS>
The
indefatigable
Mrs
Sparsit
,
with
a
violent
cold
upon
her
<EOS>
,
her
voice
reduced
to
a
whisper
,
and
her
stately
frame
so
racked
by
continual
sneezes
that
it
seemed
in
danger
of
dismemberment
,
gave
chase
to
her
patron
until
she
found
him
in
the
metropolis
;
and
there
,
majestically
sweeping
in
upon
him
at
his
hotel
in
St.
James
's
Street
,
exploded
the
combustibles
with
which
she
was
charged
,
and
blew
up
.
 
<EOS>
Having
executed
her
mission
with
infinite
relish
,
this
high
-
minded
woman
then
fainted
away
on
Mr
Bounderby
's
coat
-
collar
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
's
first
procedure
was
to
shake
Mrs
Sparsit
off
,
and
leave
her
to
progress
as
she
might
through
various
stages
of
suffering
on
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
He
next
had
recourse
to
the
administration
of
potent
restoratives
,
such
as
screwing
the
patient
's
thumbs
,
smiting
her
hands
,
abundantly
watering
her
face
,
and
inserting
salt
in
her
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
When
these
attentions
had
recovered
her
(
which
they
speedily
did
)
,
he
hustled
her
into
a
fast
train
without
offering
any
other
refreshment
,
and
carried
her
back
to
Coketown
more
dead
than
alive
.
   
<EOS>
Regarded
as
a
classical
ruin
,
Mrs
Sparsit
was
an
interesting
spectacle
on
her
arrival
at
her
journey
's
end
;
but
considered
in
any
other
light
,
the
amount
of
damage
she
had
by
that
time
sustained
was
excessive
,
and
impaired
her
claims
to
admiration
.
<EOS>
Utterly
heedless
of
the
wear
and
tear
of
her
clothes
and
constitution
,
and
adamant
to
her
pathetic
sneezes
,
Mr
Bounderby
immediately
crammed
her
into
a
coach
,
and
bore
her
off
to
Stone
Lodge
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Tom
Gradgrind
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
bursting
into
his
father
-
in
-
law
's
room
late
at
night
;
"
here
's
a
lady
here
---
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
---
you
know
Mrs
Sparsit
---
who
has
something
to
say
to
you
that
will
strike
you
dumb
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
missed
my
letter
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mr
Gradgrind
,
surprised
by
the
apparition
.
   
<EOS>
"
Missed
your
letter
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
bawled
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
present
time
is
no
time
for
letters
.
 
<EOS>
No
man
shall
talk
to
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
about
letters
,
with
his
mind
in
the
state
<EOS>
it
's
in
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bounderby
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
in
a
tone
of
temperate
remonstrance
,
"
I
speak
of
a
very
special
letter
I
have
written
to
you
,
in
reference
to
Louisa
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tom
Gradgrind
,
"
replied
Bounderby
,
knocking
the
flat
of
his
hand
several
times
with
great
vehemence
on
the
table
,
"
I
speak
of
a
very
special
messenger
that
has
come
to
me
,
in
reference
to
Louisa
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
,
ma'am
,
stand
forward
!
"
   
<EOS>
That
unfortunate
lady
hereupon
essaying
to
offer
testimony
,
without
any
voice
and
with
painful
gestures
expressive
of
an
inflamed
throat
,
became
so
aggravating
and
underwent
so
many
facial
contortions
,
that
Mr
Bounderby
,
unable
to
bear
it
,
seized
her
by
the
arm
and
shook
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
ca
n't
get
it
out
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
"
leave
me
to
get
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
not
a
time
for
a
lady
,
however
highly
connected
,
to
be
totally
inaudible
,
and
seemingly
swallowing
marbles
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
Gradgrind
,
Mrs
Sparsit
latterly
found
herself
,
by
accident
,
in
a
situation
to
overhear
a
conversation
out
of
doors
between
your
daughter
and
your
precious
gentleman
-
friend
,
Mr
James
Harthouse
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Indeed
!
"
cried
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
in
that
conversation
---
"
   
"
It
is
not
necessary
to
repeat
its
tenor
,
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
passed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
?
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
staring
with
all
his
might
at
his
so
quiet
and
assuasive
father
-
in
-
law
,
"
you
know
where
your
daughter
is
at
the
present
time
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Undoubtedly
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
?
"
   
"
My
dear
Bounderby
,
let
me
beg
you
to
restrain
these
loud
out
-
breaks
,
on
all
accounts
.
 
<EOS>
Louisa
is
here
.
 
<EOS>
The
moment
she
could
detach
herself
from
that
interview
with
the
person
of
whom
you
speak
,
and
whom
I
deeply
regret
to
have
been
the
means
of
introducing
to
you
,
Louisa
hurried
here
,
for
protection
.
 
<EOS>
I
myself
had
not
been
at
home
many
hours
,
when
I
received
her
---
here
,
in
this
room
.
 
<EOS>
She
hurried
by
the
train
to
town
,
she
ran
from
town
to
this
house
,
through
a
raging
storm
,
and
presented
herself
before
me
in
a
state
of
distraction
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
,
she
has
remained
here
ever
since
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
entreat
you
,
for
your
own
sake
and
for
hers
,
to
be
more
quiet
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
silently
gazed
about
him
for
some
moments
,
in
every
direction
except
Mrs
Sparsit
's
direction
;
and
then
,
abruptly
turning
upon
the
niece
of
Lady
Scadgers
,
said
to
that
wretched
woman
:
   
"
<EOS>
Now
,
ma'am
!
 
<EOS>
We
shall
be
happy
to
hear
any
little
apology
you
may
think
proper
to
offer
,
for
going
about
the
country
at
express
pace
,
with
no
other
luggage
than
a
Cock
-
and
-
a
-
Bull
,
ma'am
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
whispered
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
my
nerves
are
at
present
too
much
shaken
,
and
my
health
is
at
present
too
much
impaired
,
in
your
service
,
to
admit
of
my
doing
more
than
taking
refuge
in
tears
.
"
<EOS>
(
Which
she
did
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
"
without
making
any
observation
to
you
that
may
not
be
made
with
propriety
to
a
woman
of
good
family
,
what
I
have
got
to
add
to
that
,
is
that
there
is
something
else
in
which
it
appears
to
me
you
may
take
refuge
,
namely
,
a
coach
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
coach
in
which
we
came
here
being
at
the
door
<EOS>
,
you
'll
allow
me
to
hand
you
down
to
it
,
and
pack
you
home
to
the
Bank
:
 
where
the
best
course
for
you
to
pursue
,
will
be
to
put
your
feet
into
the
hottest
water
you
can
bear
,
and
take
a
glass
of
scalding
rum
and
butter
after
you
get
into
bed
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
Mr
Bounderby
extended
his
right
hand
to
the
weeping
lady
,
and
escorted
her
to
the
conveyance
in
question
,
shedding
many
plaintive
sneezes
by
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
returned
alone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
as
you
showed
me
in
your
face
,
Tom
Gradgrind
,
that
you
wanted
to
speak
to
me
,
"
he
resumed
,
"
here
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
I
am
not
in
a
very
agreeable
state
,
I
tell
you
plainly
:
 
not
relishing
this
business
,
even
as
it
is
,
and
not
considering
that
I
am
at
any
time
as
dutifully
and
submissively
treated
by
your
daughter
,
as
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
ought
to
be
treated
by
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
your
opinion
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
;
and
I
have
mine
,
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
mean
to
say
anything
to
me
to
-
night
,
that
goes
against
this
candid
remark
,
you
had
better
let
it
alone
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
,
it
will
be
observed
,
being
much
softened
,
Mr
Bounderby
took
particular
pains
to
harden
himself
at
all
points
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
amiable
nature
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Bounderby
,
"
Mr
Gradgrind
began
in
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
you
'll
excuse
me
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
n't
want
to
be
too
dear
.
 
<EOS>
That
,
to
start
with
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
begin
to
be
dear
to
a
man
,
I
generally
find
that
his
intention
is
to
come
over
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
speaking
to
you
politely
;
but
,
as
you
are
aware
,
I
am
not
polite
.
<EOS>
If
you
like
politeness
,
you
know
where
to
get
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
your
gentleman
-
friends
,
you
know
,
and
they
'll
serve
you
with
as
much
of
the
article
as
you
want
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
keep
it
myself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bounderby
,
"
urged
Mr
Gradgrind
,
"
we
are
all
liable
to
mistakes
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
I
thought
you
could
n't
make
'
em
,
"
interrupted
Bounderby
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
thought
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
I
say
we
are
all
liable
to
mistakes
and
I
should
feel
sensible
of
your
delicacy
,
and
grateful
for
it
,
if
you
would
spare
me
these
references
to
Harthouse
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
not
associate
him
in
our
conversation
with
your
intimacy
and
encouragement
;
pray
do
not
persist
in
connecting
him
with
mine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
mentioned
his
name
!
"
said
Bounderby
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
"
returned
Mr
Gradgrind
,
with
a
patient
,
even
a
submissive
,
air
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
sat
for
a
little
while
pondering
.
<EOS>
"
Bounderby
,
I
see
reason
to
doubt
whether
we
have
ever
quite
understood
Louisa
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
do
you
mean
by
We
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
say
I
,
then
,
"
he
returned
,
in
answer
to
the
coarsely
blurted
question
;
"
I
doubt
whether
I
have
understood
Louisa
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
I
have
been
quite
right
in
the
manner
of
her
education
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
you
hit
it
,
"
returned
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
I
agree
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
found
it
out
at
last
,
have
you
?
 
<EOS>
Education
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
what
education
is
---
To
be
tumbled
out
of
doors
,
neck
and
crop
,
and
put
upon
the
shortest
allowance
of
everything
except
blows
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
call
education
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
your
good
sense
will
perceive
,
"
Mr
Gradgrind
remonstrated
in
all
humility
,
"
that
whatever
the
merits
of
such
a
system
may
be
,
it
would
be
difficult
of
general
application
to
girls
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
it
at
all
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
obstinate
Bounderby
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
sighed
Mr
Gradgrind
,
"
we
will
not
enter
into
the
question
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
have
no
desire
to
be
controversial
.
 
<EOS>
I
seek
to
repair
what
is
amiss
,
if
I
possibly
can
;
and
I
hope
you
will
assist
me
in
a
good
spirit
,
Bounderby
,
for
I
have
been
very
much
distressed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
yet
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
with
determined
obstinacy
,
"
and
therefore
I
wo
n't
make
any
promises
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
course
of
a
few
hours
,
my
dear
Bounderby
,
"
Mr
Gradgrind
proceeded
,
in
the
same
depressed
and
propitiatory
manner
,
"
I
appear
to
myself
to
have
become
better
informed
as
to
Louisa
's
character
,
than
in
previous
years
.
 
<EOS>
The
enlightenment
has
been
painfully
forced
upon
me
,
and
the
discovery
is
not
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
there
are
---
<EOS>
Bounderby
,
you
will
be
surprised
to
hear
me
say
this
---
I
think
there
are
qualities
in
Louisa
,
which
---
which
have
been
harshly
neglected
,
and
---
and
a
little
perverted
.
 
<EOS>
And
---
and
I
would
suggest
to
you
,
that
---
that
if
you
would
kindly
meet
me
in
a
timely
endeavour
to
leave
her
to
her
better
nature
for
a
while
---
and
to
encourage
it
to
develop
itself
by
tenderness
and
consideration
---
it
---
it
would
be
the
better
for
the
happiness
of
all
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
Louisa
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
shading
his
face
with
his
hand
,
"
has
always
been
my
favourite
child
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
blustrous
Bounderby
crimsoned
and
swelled
to
such
an
extent
on
hearing
these
words
,
that
he
seemed
to
be
,
and
probably
was
,
on
the
brink
of
a
fit
.
 
<EOS>
With
his
very
ears
a
bright
purple
shot
with
crimson
,
he
pent
up
his
indignation
,
however
,
and
said
:
   
"
You
'd
like
to
keep
her
here
for
a
time
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
had
intended
to
recommend
,
my
dear
Bounderby
,
that
you
should
allow
Louisa
to
remain
here
on
a
visit
,
and
be
attended
by
Sissy
(
I
mean
of
course
Cecilia
Jupe
)
,
who
understands
her
,
and
in
whom
she
trusts
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
gather
from
all
this
,
Tom
Gradgrind
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
standing
up
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
"
that
you
are
of
opinion
that
there
's
what
people
call
some
incompatibility
between
Loo
Bounderby
and
myself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
fear
there
is
at
present
a
general
incompatibility
between
Louisa
,
and
---
and
---
and
almost
all
the
relations
in
which
I
have
placed
her
,
"
was
her
father
's
sorrowful
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
look
you
here
,
Tom
Gradgrind
,
"
said
Bounderby
the
flushed
,
confronting
him
with
his
legs
wide
apart
,
his
hands
deeper
in
his
pockets
,
and
his
hair
like
a
hayfield
wherein
his
windy
anger
was
boisterous
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
said
your
say
;
I
am
going
to
say
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
Coketown
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
bricks
of
this
town
,
and
I
know
the
works
of
this
town
,
and
I
know
the
chimneys
of
this
town
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
the
smoke
of
this
town
,
and
I
know
the
Hands
of
this
town
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
'em
all
pretty
well
.
 
<EOS>
They
're
real
.
 
<EOS>
When
a
man
tells
me
anything
about
imaginative
qualities
,
I
always
tell
that
man
,
whoever
he
is
,
that
I
know
what
he
means
.
 
<EOS>
He
means
turtle
soup
and
venison
,
with
a
gold
spoon
,
and
that
he
wants
to
be
set
up
with
a
coach
and
six
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
your
daughter
wants
.
 
<EOS>
Since
you
are
of
opinion
that
she
ought
to
have
what
she
wants
,
I
recommend
you
to
provide
it
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
Because
,
Tom
Gradgrind
,
she
will
never
have
it
from
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bounderby
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
"
I
hoped
,
after
my
entreaty
,
you
would
have
taken
a
different
tone
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
wait
a
bit
,
"
retorted
Bounderby
;
"
you
have
said
your
say
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
you
out
;
hear
me
out
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
make
yourself
a
spectacle
of
unfairness
as
well
as
inconsistency
,
because
,
although
I
am
sorry
to
see
Tom
Gradgrind
reduced
to
his
present
position
,
I
should
be
doubly
sorry
to
see
him
brought
so
low
as
that
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
there
's
an
incompatibility
of
some
sort
or
another
,
I
am
given
to
understand
by
you
,
between
your
daughter
and
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
give
you
to
understand
,
in
reply
to
that
,
that
there
unquestionably
is
an
incompatibility
of
the
first
magnitude
---
to
be
summed
up
in
this
---
that
your
daughter
do
n't
properly
know
her
husband
's
merits
,
and
is
not
impressed
with
such
a
sense
as
would
become
her
,
by
George
!
<EOS>
of
the
honour
of
his
alliance
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
plain
speaking
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bounderby
,
"
urged
Mr
Gradgrind
,
"
this
is
unreasonable
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
?
"
said
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
Because
when
Tom
Gradgrind
,
with
his
new
lights
,
tells
me
that
what
I
say
is
unreasonable
,
I
am
convinced
at
once
it
must
be
devilish
sensible
.
 
<EOS>
With
your
permission
I
am
going
on
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
my
origin
;
and
you
know
that
for
a
good
many
years
of
my
life
I
did
n't
want
a
shoeing
-
horn
,
in
consequence
of
not
having
a
shoe
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
you
may
believe
or
not
,
as
you
think
proper
,
that
there
are
ladies
---
born
ladies
---
belonging
to
families
---
Families
!
<EOS>
---
who
next
to
worship
the
ground
I
walk
on
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
discharged
this
like
a
Rocket
,
at
his
father
-
in
-
law
's
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whereas
your
daughter
,
"
proceeded
Bounderby
,
"
is
far
from
being
a
born
lady
.
 
<EOS>
That
you
know
,
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
I
care
a
pinch
of
candle
-
snuff
about
such
things
,
for
you
are
very
well
aware
I
do
n't
;
but
that
such
is
the
fact
,
and
you
,
Tom
Gradgrind
,
ca
n't
change
it
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
I
say
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
,
I
fear
,
"
observed
Mr
Gradgrind
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
to
spare
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
out
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
"
and
refrain
from
cutting
in
till
your
turn
comes
round
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
this
,
because
highly
connected
females
have
been
astonished
to
see
the
way
in
which
your
daughter
has
conducted
herself
,
and
to
witness
her
insensibility
.
 
<EOS>
They
have
wondered
how
I
have
suffered
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
wonder
myself
now
,
and
I
wo
n't
suffer
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bounderby
,
"
returned
Mr
Gradgrind
,
rising
,
"
the
less
we
say
to
-
night
<EOS>
the
better
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
Tom
Gradgrind
,
the
more
we
say
to
-
night
,
the
better
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
,
"
the
consideration
checked
him
,
"
till
I
have
said
all
I
mean
to
say
,
and
then
I
do
n't
care
how
soon
we
stop
.
 
<EOS>
I
come
to
a
question
that
may
shorten
the
business
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
by
the
proposal
you
made
just
now
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
I
mean
,
Bounderby
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
your
visiting
proposition
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
with
an
inflexible
jerk
of
the
hayfield
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
mean
that
I
hope
you
may
be
induced
to
arrange
in
a
friendly
manner
,
for
allowing
Louisa
a
period
of
repose
and
reflection
here
,
which
may
tend
to
a
gradual
alteration
for
the
better
in
many
respects
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
To
a
softening
down
of
your
ideas
of
the
incompatibility
?
"
said
Bounderby
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
put
it
in
those
terms
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
made
you
think
of
this
?
"
said
Bounderby
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
said
,
I
fear
Louisa
has
not
been
understood
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
asking
too
much
,
Bounderby
,
that
you
,
so
far
her
elder
,
should
aid
in
trying
to
set
her
right
?
 
<EOS>
You
have
accepted
a
great
charge
of
her
;
for
better
for
worse
,
for
---
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
may
have
been
annoyed
by
the
repetition
of
his
own
words
to
Stephen
Blackpool
,
but
he
cut
the
quotation
short
with
an
angry
start
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
"
I
do
n't
want
to
be
told
about
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
took
her
for
,
as
well
as
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
Never
you
mind
what
I
took
her
for
;
that
's
my
look
out
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
merely
going
on
to
remark
,
Bounderby
,
that
we
may
all
be
more
or
less
in
the
wrong
,
not
even
excepting
you
;
and
that
some
yielding
on
your
part
,
remembering
the
trust
you
have
accepted
,
may
not
only
be
an
act
of
true
kindness
,
but
perhaps
a
debt
incurred
towards
Louisa
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
differently
,
"
blustered
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
finish
this
business
according
to
my
own
opinions
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
do
n't
want
to
make
a
quarrel
of
it
with
you
,
Tom
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
do
n't
think
it
would
be
worthy
of
my
reputation
to
quarrel
on
such
a
subject
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
your
gentleman
-
friend
,
he
may
take
himself
off
,
wherever
he
likes
best
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
falls
in
my
way
,
I
shall
tell
him
my
mind
;
if
he
do
n't
fall
in
my
way
,
I
sha
n't
,
for
it
wo
n't
be
worth
my
while
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
your
daughter
,
whom
I
made
Loo
Bounderby
,
and
might
have
done
better
by
leaving
Loo
Gradgrind
,
if
she
do
n't
come
home
to
-
morrow
,
by
twelve
o'clock
at
noon
,
I
shall
understand
that
she
prefers
to
stay
away
,
and
I
shall
send
her
wearing
apparel
and
so
forth
over
here
,
and
you
'll
take
charge
of
her
for
the
future
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
shall
say
to
people
in
general
,
of
the
incompatibility
that
led
to
my
so
laying
down
the
law
,
will
be
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
Josiah
Bounderby
,
and
I
had
my
bringing
-
up
;
she
's
the
daughter
of
Tom
Gradgrind
,
and
she
had
her
bringing
-
up
;
and
the
two
horses
would
n't
pull
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
pretty
well
known
to
be
rather
an
uncommon
man
,
I
believe
;
and
most
people
will
understand
fast
enough
that
it
must
be
a
woman
rather
out
of
the
common
,
also
,
who
,
in
the
long
run
,
would
come
up
to
my
mark
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
seriously
entreat
you
to
reconsider
this
,
Bounderby
,
"
urged
Mr
Gradgrind
,
"
before
you
commit
yourself
to
such
a
decision
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
always
come
to
a
decision
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
tossing
his
hat
on
:
"
and
whatever
I
do
,
I
do
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
surprised
at
Tom
Gradgrind
's
addressing
such
a
remark
to
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
,
knowing
what
he
knows
of
him
,
if
I
could
be
surprised
by
anything
Tom
Gradgrind
did
,
after
his
making
himself
a
party
to
sentimental
humbug
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
given
you
my
decision
,
and
I
have
got
no
more
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
So
Mr
Bounderby
went
home
to
his
town
house
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
At
five
minutes
past
twelve
o'clock
next
day
,
he
directed
Mrs
Bounderby
's
property
to
be
carefully
packed
up
and
sent
to
Tom
Gradgrind
's
;
advertised
his
country
retreat
for
sale
by
private
contract
;
and
resumed
a
bachelor
life
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
04
.
<EOS>
Lost
 
The
robbery
at
the
Bank
had
not
languished
before
,
and
did
not
cease
to
occupy
a
front
place
in
the
attention
of
the
principal
of
that
establishment
now
.
 
<EOS>
In
boastful
proof
of
his
promptitude
and
activity
,
as
a
remarkable
man
,
and
a
self
-
made
man
,
and
a
commercial
wonder
more
admirable
than
Venus
,
who
had
risen
out
of
the
mud
instead
of
the
sea
,
he
liked
to
show
how
little
his
domestic
affairs
abated
his
business
ardour
.
 
<EOS>
Consequently
,
in
the
first
few
weeks
of
his
resumed
bachelorhood
,
he
even
advanced
upon
his
usual
display
of
bustle
,
and
every
day
made
such
a
rout
in
renewing
his
investigations
into
the
robbery
,
that
the
officers
who
had
it
in
hand
almost
wished
it
had
never
been
committed
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
at
fault
too
,
and
off
the
scent
.
 
<EOS>
Although
they
had
been
so
quiet
since
the
first
outbreak
of
the
matter
,
that
most
people
really
did
suppose
it
to
have
been
abandoned
as
hopeless
,
nothing
new
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
No
implicated
man
or
woman
took
untimely
courage
,
or
made
a
self
-
betraying
step
.
 
<EOS>
More
remarkable
yet
,
Stephen
Blackpool
could
not
be
heard
of
,
and
the
mysterious
old
woman
remained
a
mystery
.
   
<EOS>
Things
having
come
to
this
pass
,
and
showing
no
latent
signs
of
stirring
beyond
it
,
the
upshot
of
Mr
Bounderby
's
investigations
was
,
that
he
resolved
to
hazard
a
bold
burst
.
 
<EOS>
He
drew
up
a
placard
,
offering
Twenty
Pounds
reward
for
the
apprehension
of
Stephen
Blackpool
,
suspected
of
complicity
in
the
robbery
of
Coketown
Bank
on
such
a
night
<EOS>
;
he
described
the
said
Stephen
Blackpool
by
dress
,
complexion
,
estimated
height
,
and
manner
,
as
minutely
as
he
could
;
he
recited
how
he
had
left
the
town
,
and
in
what
direction
he
had
been
last
seen
going
;
he
had
the
whole
printed
in
great
black
letters
on
a
staring
broadsheet
;
and
he
caused
the
walls
to
be
posted
with
it
in
the
dead
of
night
,
so
that
it
should
strike
upon
the
sight
of
the
whole
population
at
one
blow
.
   
<EOS>
The
factory
-
bells
had
need
to
ring
their
loudest
that
morning
to
disperse
the
groups
of
workers
who
stood
in
the
tardy
daybreak
,
collected
round
the
placards
,
devouring
them
with
eager
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Not
the
least
eager
of
the
eyes
assembled
,
were
the
eyes
of
those
who
could
not
read
.
 
<EOS>
These
people
,
as
they
listened
to
the
friendly
voice
that
read
aloud
---
there
was
always
some
such
ready
to
help
them
---
stared
at
the
characters
which
meant
so
much
with
a
vague
awe
and
respect
that
would
have
been
half
ludicrous
,
if
any
aspect
of
public
ignorance
could
ever
be
otherwise
than
threatening
and
full
of
evil
.
 
<EOS>
Many
ears
and
eyes
were
busy
with
a
vision
of
the
matter
of
these
placards
,
among
turning
spindles
,
rattling
looms
,
and
whirling
wheels
,
for
hours
afterwards
;
and
when
the
Hands
cleared
out
again
into
the
streets
,
there
were
still
as
many
readers
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
Slackbridge
,
the
delegate
,
had
to
address
his
audience
too
that
night
;
and
Slackbridge
had
obtained
a
clean
bill
from
the
printer
,
and
had
brought
it
in
his

Oh
,
my
friends
and
fellow
-
countrymen
,
the
down
-
trodden
operatives
of
Coketown
,
oh
,
my
fellow

brothers
and
fellow
-
workmen
and
fellow
-
citizens
and
fellowmen
,
what
a
to
-
do
was
there
,
when
Slackbridge
unfolded
what
he
called
"
that
damning
document
,
"
and
held
it
up
to
the
gaze
,
and
for
the
execration
of
the
working

man
community
!
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
fellow

men
,
behold
of
what
a
traitor
in
the
camp
of
those
great
spirits
who
are
enrolled
upon
the
holy
scroll
of
Justice
and
of
Union
,
is
appropriately
capable
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
prostrate
friends
,
with
the
galling
yoke
of
tyrants
on
your
necks
and
the
iron
foot
of
despotism
treading
down
your
fallen
forms
into
the
dust
of
the
earth
,
upon
which
right
glad
would
your
oppressors
be
to
see
you
creeping
on
your
bellies
all
the
days
of
your
lives
,
like
the
serpent
in
the
garden
<EOS>
---
oh
,
my
brothers
,
and
shall
I
as
a
man
not
add
,
my
sisters
too
,
what
do
you
say
,
now
,
of
Stephen
Blackpool
,
with
a
slight
stoop
in
his
shoulders
and
about
five
foot
seven
in
height
,
as
set
forth
in
this
degrading
and
disgusting
document
,
this
blighting
bill
,
this
pernicious
placard
,
this
abominable
advertisement
;
and
with
what
majesty
of
denouncement
will
you
crush
the
viper
,
who
would
bring
this
stain
and
shame
upon
the
God
-
like
race
that
happily
has
cast
him
out
for
ever
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
compatriots
,
happily
cast
him
out
and
sent
him
forth
!
 
<EOS>
For
you
remember
how
he
stood
here
before
you
on
this
platform
;
you
remember
how
,
face
to
face
and
foot
to
foot
,
I
pursued
him
through
all
his
intricate
windings
;
you
remember
how
he
sneaked
and
slunk
,
and
sidled
,
and
splitted
of
straws
,
until
,
with
not
an
inch
of
ground
to
which
to
cling
,
I
hurled
him
out
from
amongst
us
:
 
an
object
for
the
undying
finger
of
scorn
to
point
at
,
and
for
the
avenging
fire
of
every
free
and
thinking
mind
to
scorch
and
scar
!
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
friends
---
my
labouring
friends
,
for
I
rejoice
and
triumph
in
that
stigma
---
<EOS>
my
friends
whose
hard
but
honest
beds
are
made
in
toil
,
and
whose
scanty
but
independent
pots
are
boiled
in
hardship
;
and
now
,
I
say
,
my
friends
,
what
appellation
has
that
dastard
craven
taken
to
himself
,
when
,
with
the
mask
torn
from
his
features
,
he
stands
before
us
in
all
his
native
deformity
,
<EOS>
a
What
?
 
<EOS>
A
thief
!
 
<EOS>
A
plunderer
!
 
<EOS>
A
proscribed
fugitive
,
with
a
price
upon
his
head
;
<EOS>
a
fester
and
a
wound
upon
the
noble
character
of
the
Coketown
operative
!
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
my
band
of
brothers
in
a
sacred
bond
,
to
which
your
children
and
your
children
's
children
yet
unborn
have
set
their
infant
hands
and
seals
,
I
propose
to
you
on
the
part
of
the
United
Aggregate
Tribunal
,
ever
watchful
for
your
welfare
,
ever
zealous
for
your
benefit
,
that
this
meeting
does
Resolve
:
 
That
Stephen
Blackpool
,
weaver
,
referred
to
in
this
placard
,
having
been
already
solemnly
disowned
by
the
community
of
Coketown
Hands
,
the
same
are
free
from
the
shame
of
his
misdeeds
,
and
can
not
as
a
class
be
reproached
with
his
dishonest
actions
!
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
Slackbridge
;
gnashing
and
perspiring
after
a
prodigious
sort
.
<EOS>
A
few
stern
voices
called
out
"
No
!
"
and
a
score
or
two
hailed
,
with
assenting
cries
of
"
Hear
,
hear
!
"
<EOS>
the
caution
from
one
man
,
"
Slackbridge
,
y'or
over
hetter
in't
;
y'or
a
goen
too
fast
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
these
were
pigmies
against
an
army
;
the
general
assemblage
subscribed
to
the
gospel
according
to
Slackbridge
,
and
gave
three
cheers
for
him
,
as
he
sat
demonstratively
panting
at
them
.
   
<EOS>
These
men
and
women
were
yet
in
the
streets
,
passing
quietly
to
their
homes
,
when
Sissy
,
who
had
been
called
away
from
Louisa
some
minutes
before
,
returned
.
   
<EOS>
"
Who
is
it
?
"
asked
Louisa
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
Mr
Bounderby
,
"
said
Sissy
,
timid
of
the
name
,
"
and
your
brother
Mr
Tom
,
and
a
young
woman
who
says
her
name
is
Rachael
,
and
that
you
know
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
they
want
,
Sissy
dear
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
want
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
Rachael
has
been
crying
,
and
seems
angry
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Father
,
"
said
Louisa
,
<EOS>
for
he
was
present
,
"
I
can
not
refuse
to
see
them
,
for
a
reason
that
will
explain
itself
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
they
come
in
here
?
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
answered
in
the
affirmative
,
Sissy
went
away
to
bring
them
.
<EOS>
She
reappeared
with
them
directly
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
was
last
;
and
remained
standing
in
the
obscurest
part
of
the
room
,
near
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Bounderby
,
"
said
her
husband
,
entering
with
a
cool
nod
,
"
I
do
n't
disturb
you
,
<EOS>
I
hope
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
an
unseasonable
hour
,
but
here
is
a
young
woman
who
has
been
making
statements
which
render
my
visit
necessary
.
 
<EOS>
Tom
Gradgrind
,
as
your
son
,
young
Tom
,
refuses
for
some
obstinate
reason
or
other
to
say
anything
at
all
about
those
statements
,
good
or
bad
,
I
am
obliged
to
confront
her
with
your
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
me
once
before
,
young
lady
,
"
said
Rachael
,
standing
in
front
of
Louisa
.
   
<EOS>
Tom
coughed
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
me
,
young
lady
,
"
repeated
Rachael
,
as
she
did
not
answer
,
"
once
before
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
coughed
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rachael
cast
her
eyes
proudly
towards
Mr
Bounderby
,
and
said
,
"
Will
you
make
it
known
,
young
lady
,
where
,
and
who
was
there
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
went
to
the
house
where
Stephen
Blackpool
lodged
,
on
the
night
of
his
discharge
from
his
work
,
and
I
saw
you
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
there
too
;
and
an
old
woman
who
did
not
speak
,
and
whom
I
could
scarcely
see
,
stood
in
a
dark
corner
.
 
<EOS>
My
brother
was
with
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
could
n't
you
say
so
,
young
Tom
?
"
demanded
Bounderby
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
promised
my
sister
I
would
n't
.
"
 
<EOS>
Which
Louisa
hastily
confirmed
.
"
<EOS>
And
besides
,
"
said
the
whelp
bitterly
,
"
she
tells
her
own
story
so
precious
well
---
and
so
full
---
that
what
business
had
I
to
take
it
out
of
her
mouth
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Say
,
young
lady
,
if
you
please
,
"
pursued
Rachael
,
"
why
,
in
an
evil
hour
,
you
ever
came
to
Stephen
's
that
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
felt
compassion
for
him
,
"
said
Louisa
,
her
colour
deepening
,
"
and
I
wished
to
know
what
he
was
going
to
do
,
and
wished
to
offer
him
assistance
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
Much
flattered
and
obliged
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
offer
him
,
"
asked
Rachael
,
"
a
bank
-
note
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
but
he
refused
it
,
and
would
only
take
two
pounds
in
gold
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rachael
cast
her
eyes
towards
Mr
Bounderby
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
certainly
!
"
said
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
put
the
question
whether
your
ridiculous
and
improbable
account
was
true
or
not
,
I
am
bound
to
say
it
's
confirmed
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Young
lady
,
"
said
Rachael
,
"
Stephen
Blackpool
is
now
named
as
a
thief
in
public
print
all
over
this
town
,
and
where
else
!
 
<EOS>
There
have
been
a
meeting
to
-
night
where
he
have
been
spoken
of
in
the
same
shameful
way
.
 
<EOS>
Stephen
!
 
<EOS>
The
honestest
lad
,
the
truest
lad
,
the
best
!
"
 
<EOS>
Her
indignation
failed
her
,
and
she
broke
off
sobbing
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
,
very
sorry
,
"
said
Louisa
.
   
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
young
lady
,
young
lady
,
"
returned
Rachael
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
you
may
be
,
but
I
do
n't
know
!
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
what
you
may
ha
'
done
!
 
<EOS>
The
like
of
you
do
n't
know
us
,
do
n't
care
for
us
,
do
n't
belong
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
sure
why
you
may
ha
'
come
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
tell
<EOS>
but
what
you
may
ha
'
come
wi
'
some
aim
of
your
own
,
not
mindin
to
what
trouble
you
brought
such
as
the
poor
lad
.
 
<EOS>
I
said
then
,
Bless
you
for
coming
;
and
I
said
it
of
my
heart
,
you
seemed
to
take
so
pitifully
to
him
;
but
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
now
,
I
do
n't
know
!
"
   
<EOS>
Louisa
could
not
reproach
her
for
her
unjust
suspicions
;
she
was
so
faithful
to
her
idea
of
the
man
,
and
so
afflicted
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
when
I
think
,
"
said
Rachael
through
her
sobs
,
"
that
the
poor
lad
was
so
grateful
,
thinkin
you
<EOS>
so
good
to
him
<EOS>
---
when
I
mind
that
he
put
his
hand
over
his
hard
-
worken
face
to
hide
the
tears
that
you
brought
up
there
---
Oh
,
I
hope
you
may
be
sorry
,
and
ha
'
no
bad
cause
to
be
it
;
but
I
do
n't
know
,
I
do
n't
know
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
pretty
article
,
"
growled
the
whelp
,
moving
uneasily
in
his
dark
corner
,
"
to
come
here
with
these
precious
imputations
!
<EOS>
You
ought
to
be
bundled
out
for
not
knowing
how
to
behave
yourself
,
and
you
would
be
by
rights
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
said
nothing
in
reply
;
and
her
low
weeping
was
the
only
sound
that
was
heard
,
until
Mr
Bounderby
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
"
you
know
what
you
have
engaged
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
better
give
your
mind
to
that
;
not
this
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
'
Deed
,
I
am
loath
,
"
returned
Rachael
,
drying
her
eyes
,
"
that
any
here
should
see
me
like
this
;
but
I
wo
n't
be
seen
so
again
.
 
<EOS>
Young
lady
,
when
I
had
read
what
's
put
in
print
of
Stephen
---
and
what
has
just
as
much
truth
in
it
as
if
it
had
been
put
in
print
of
you
---
I
went
straight
to
the
Bank
to
say
I
knew
where
Stephen
was
,
and
to
give
a
sure
and
certain
promise
that
he
should
be
here
in
two
days
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
meet
wi
'
Mr
Bounderby
then
,
and
your
brother
sent
me
away
,
and
I
tried
to
find
you
,
but
you
was
not
to
be
found
,
and
I
went
back
to
work
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
as
I
come
out
of
the
Mill
to
-
night
,
I
hastened
to
hear
what
was
said
of
Stephen
---
<EOS>
for
I
know
<EOS>
wi
'
pride
he
will
come
back
to
shame
it
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
then
I
went
again
to
seek
Mr
Bounderby
,
and
I
found
him
,
and
I
told
him
every
word
I
knew
;
and
he
believed
no
word
I
said
,
and
brought
me
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
far
,
that
's
true
enough
,
"
assented
Mr
Bounderby
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
hat
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
known
you
people
before
to
-
day
,
you
'll
observe
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
you
never
die
for
want
of
talking
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
I
recommend
you
not
so
much
to
mind
talking
just
now
,
as
doing
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
undertaken
to
do
something
;
all
I
remark
upon
that
at
present
is
,
do
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
written
to
Stephen
by
the
post
that
went
out
this
afternoon
,
as
I
have
written
to
him
once
before
sin
'
<EOS>
he
went
away
,
"
said
Rachael
;
"
and
he
will
be
here
,
at
furthest
,
in
two
days
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
I
'll
tell
you
something
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
not
aware
perhaps
,
"
retorted
Mr
Bounderby
,
"
that
you
yourself
have
been
looked
after
now
and
<EOS>
then
,
not
being
considered
quite
free
from
suspicion
in
this
business
,
on
account
of
most
people
being
judged
according
to
the
company
they
keep
.
 
<EOS>
The
post
-
office
has
n't
been
forgotten
either
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
'll
tell
you
is
,
that
no
letter
to
Stephen
Blackpool
has
ever
got
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
what
has
become
of
yours
,
I
leave
you
to
guess
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
're
mistaken
,
and
never
wrote
any
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
had
n't
been
gone
from
here
,
young
lady
,
"
said
Rachael
,
turning
appealingly
to
Louisa
,
"
as
much
as
a
week
,
when
he
sent
me
the
only
letter
I
have
had
from
him
,
saying
that
he
was
forced
to
seek
work
in
another
name
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
by
George
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bounderby
,
shaking
his
head
,
with
a
whistle
<EOS>
,
"
he
changes
his
name
,
does
he
!
 
<EOS>
That
's
rather
unlucky
,
too
,
for
such
an
immaculate
chap
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
considered
a
little
suspicious
in
Courts
of
Justice
,
I
believe
,
when
an
Innocent
happens
to
have
many
names
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
,
"
said
Rachael
,
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
again
,
"
what
,
young
lady
,
in
the
name
of
Mercy
,
was
left
the
poor
lad
to
do
!
 
<EOS>
The
masters
against
him
on
one
hand
,
the
men
against
him
on
the
other
,
he
only
wantin
to
work
hard
in
peace
,
and
do
what
he
felt
right
.
<EOS>
Can
a
man
have
no
soul
of
his
own
,
no
mind
of
his
own
?
 
<EOS>
Must
he
go
wrong
all
through
wi
'
this
side
,
or
must
he
go
wrong
all
through
wi
'
that
,
or
else
be
hunted
like
a
hare
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
indeed
,
I
pity
him
from
my
heart
,
"
returned
Louisa
;
"
and
I
hope
that
he
will
clear
himself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
need
have
no
fear
of
that
,
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
sure
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
All
the
surer
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
,
"
for
your
refusing
to
tell
where
he
is
?
 
<EOS>
Eh
?
"
   
"
He
shall
not
,
through
any
act
of
mine
,
come
back
wi
'
the
unmerited
reproach
of
being
brought
back
.
 
<EOS>
He
shall
come
back
of
his
own
accord
to
clear
himself
,
and
put
all
those
that
have
injured
his
good
character
,
and
he
not
here
for
its
defence
,
to
shame
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
told
him
what
has
been
done
against
him
,
"
said
Rachael
,
throwing
off
all
distrust
as
a
rock
throws
of
the
sea
,
"
and
he
will
be
here
,
at
furthest
,
in
two
days
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Notwithstanding
which
,
"
added
Mr
Bounderby
,
"
if
he
can
be
laid
hold
of
any
sooner
,
he
shall
have
an
earlier
opportunity
of
clearing
himself
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
you
,
I
have
nothing
against
you
;
what
you
came
and
told
me
turns
out
to
be
true
,
and
I
have
given
you
the
means
of
proving
it
to
be
true
,
and
there
's
an
end
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
good
night
all
!
 
<EOS>
I
must
be
off
to
look
a
little
further
into
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
Tom
came
out
of
his
corner
when
Mr
Bounderby
moved
,
moved
with
him
,
kept
close
to
him
,
and
went
away
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
parting
salutation
of
which
he
delivered
himself
was
a
sulky
"
<EOS>
Good
night
,
father
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
a
brief
speech
,
and
a
scowl
at
his
sister
,
he
left
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
Since
his
sheet
-
anchor
had
come
home
,
Mr
Gradgrind
had
been
sparing
of
speech
.
 
<EOS>
He
still
sat
silent
,
when
Louisa
mildly
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Rachael
,
you
will
not
distrust
me
one
day
,
when
you
know
me
better
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
goes
against
me
,
"
Rachael
answered
,
in
a
gentler
manner
,
"
to
mistrust
any
one
;
but
when
I
am
so
mistrusted
---
when
we
all
are
---
I
can
not
keep
such
things
quite
out
of
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
your
pardon
for
having
done
you
an
injury
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
what
I
said
now
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
I
might
come
to
think
it
again
,
wi
'
the
poor
lad
so
wronged
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
tell
him
in
your
letter
,
"
inquired
Sissy
,
"
that
suspicion
seemed
to
have
fallen
upon
him
,
because
he
had
been
seen
about
the
Bank
at
night
?
 
<EOS>
He
would
then
know
what
he
would
have
to
explain
on
coming
back
,
and
would
be
ready
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
dear
,
"
she
returned
;
"
but
I
ca
n't
guess
what
can
have
ever
taken
him
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
used
to
go
there
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
never
in
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
His
way
was
the
same
as
mine
,
and
not
near
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sissy
had
already
been
at
her
side
asking
her
where
she
lived
,
and
whether
she
might
come
to
-
morrow
night
,
to
inquire
if
there
were
news
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
,
"
said
Rachael
,
"
if
he
can
be
here
till
next
day
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
come
next
night
too
,
"
said
Sissy
.
   
<EOS>
When
Rachael
,
assenting
to
this
,
was
gone
,
Mr
Gradgrind
lifted
up
his
head
,
and
said
to
his
daughter
:
   
"
Louisa
,
my
dear
,
I
have
never
,
that
I
know
of
,
seen
this
man
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
believe
him
to
be
implicated
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
believed
it
,
father
,
though
with
great
difficulty
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
to
say
,
you
once
persuaded
yourself
to
believe
it
,
from
knowing
him
to
be
suspected
.
 
<EOS>
His
appearance
and
manner
;
are
they
so
honest
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
honest
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
her
confidence
not
to
be
shaken
!
 
<EOS>
I
ask
myself
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
musing
,
"
does
the
real
culprit
know
of
these
accusations
?
 
<EOS>
Where
is
he
?
 
<EOS>
Who
is
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
His
hair
had
latterly
began
to
change
its
colour
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
leaned
upon
his
hand
again
,
looking
gray
and
old
,
Louisa
,
with
a
face
of
fear
and
pity
,
hurriedly
went
over
to
him
,
and
sat
close
at
his
side
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eyes
by
accident
met
Sissy
's
at
the
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Sissy
flushed
and
started
,
and
Louisa
put
her
finger
on
her
lip
.
   
<EOS>
Next
night
,
when
Sissy
returned
home
and
told
Louisa
that
Stephen
was
not
come
,
she
told
it
in
a
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
Next
night
again
,
when
she
came
home
with
the
same
account
,
and
added
that
he
had
not
been
heard
of
,
she
spoke
in
the
same
low
frightened
tone
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
moment
of
that
interchange
of
looks
,
they
never
uttered
his
name
,
or
any
reference
to
him
,
aloud
;
nor
ever
pursued
the
subject
of
the
robbery
,
when
Mr
Gradgrind
spoke
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
The
two
appointed
days
ran
out
,
three
days
and
nights
ran
out
,
and
Stephen
Blackpool
was
not
come
,
and
remained
unheard
of
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
fourth
day
,
Rachael
,
with
unabated
confidence
,
but
considering
her
despatch
to
have
miscarried
,
went
up
to
the
Bank
,
and
showed
her
letter
from
him
with
his
address
,
at
a
working
colony
,
one
of
many
,
not
upon
the
main
road
,
sixty
miles
away
.
 
<EOS>
Messengers
were
sent
to
that
place
,
and
the
whole
town
looked
for
Stephen
to
be
brought
in
next
day
.
   
<EOS>
During
this
whole
time
the
whelp
moved
about
with
Mr
Bounderby
like
his
shadow
,
assisting
in
all
the
proceedings
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
greatly
excited
,
horribly
fevered
,
bit
his
nails
down
to
the
quick
,
spoke
in
a
hard
rattling
voice
,
and
with
lips
that
were
black
and
burnt
up
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
hour
when
the
suspected
man
was
looked
for
,
the
whelp
was
at
the
station
;
offering
to
wager
that
he
had
made
off
before
the
arrival
of
those
who
were
sent
in
quest
of
him
,
and
that
he
would
not
appear
.
   
<EOS>
The
whelp
was
right
.
 
<EOS>
The
messengers
returned
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Rachael
's
letter
had
gone
,
Rachael
's
letter
had
been
delivered
.
 
<EOS>
Stephen
Blackpool
had
decamped
in
that
same
hour
;
and
no
soul
knew
more
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
doubt
in
Coketown
was
,
whether
Rachael
had
written
in
good
faith
,
believing
that
he
really
would
come
back
,
or
warning
him
to
fly
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
point
opinion
was
divided
.
   
<EOS>
Six
days
,
seven
days
,
far
on
into
another
week
.
 
<EOS>
The
wretched
whelp
plucked
up
a
ghastly
courage
,
and
began
to
grow
defiant
.
 
<EOS>
"
Was
the
suspected
fellow
the
thief
?
 
<EOS>
A
pretty
question
!
 
<EOS>
If
not
,
where
was
the
man
,
and
why
did
he
not
come
back
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Where
was
the
man
,
and
why
did
he
not
come
back
?
 
<EOS>
In
the
dead
of
night
the
echoes
of
his
own
words
,
which
had
rolled
Heaven
knows
how
far
away
in
the
daytime
,
came
back
instead
,
and
abided
by
him
until
morning
.

and

day
and

again
.
 
<EOS>
No
Stephen
Blackpool
.
<EOS>
Where
was
the
man
,
and
why
did
he
not
come
back
?
   
<EOS>
Every
night
,
Sissy
went
to
Rachael
's
lodging
,
and
sat
with
her
in
her
small
neat
room
.
 
<EOS>
All
day
,
Rachael
toiled
as
such
people
must
toil
,
whatever
their
anxieties
.
 
<EOS>
The
smoke
-
serpents
were
indifferent
who
was
lost
or
found
,
who
turned
out
bad
or
good
;
the
melancholy
mad
elephants
,
like
the
Hard
Fact
men
,
abated
nothing
of
their
set
routine
,
whatever
happened
.
 
<EOS>
Day
and
night
again
,
day
and
night
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
monotony
was
unbroken
.
 
<EOS>
Even
Stephen
Blackpool
's
disappearance
was
falling
into
the
general
way
,
and
becoming
as
monotonous
a
wonder
as
any
piece
of
machinery
in
Coketown
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
misdoubt
,
"
said
Rachael
,
"
if
there
is
as
many
as
twenty
left
in
all
this
place
,
who
have
any
trust
in
the
poor
dear
lad
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
She
said
it
to
Sissy
,
as
they
sat
in
her
lodging
,
lighted
only
by
the
lamp
at
the
street
corner
.
 
<EOS>
Sissy
had
come
there
when
it
was
already
dark
,
to
await
her
return
from
work
;
and
they
had
since
sat
at
the
window
where
Rachael
had
found
her
,
wanting
no
brighter
light
to
shine
on
their
sorrowful
talk
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
it
had
n't
been
mercifully
brought
about
,
that
I
was
to
have
you
to
speak
to
,
"
pursued
Rachael
,
<EOS>
"
times
are
,
when
I
think
my
mind
would
not
have
kept
right
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
get
hope
and
strength
through
you
;
and
you
believe
that
though
appearances
may
rise
against
him
,
he
will
be
proved
clear
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
believe
so
,
"
returned
Sissy
,
"
with
my
whole
heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
so
certain
,
Rachael
,
that
the
confidence
you
hold
in
yours
against
all
discouragement
,
is
not
like
to
be
wrong
,
that
I
have
no
more
doubt
of
him
than
if
I
had
known
him
through
as
many
years
of
trial
as
you
have
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Rachel
,
with
a
tremble
in
her
voice
,
"
have
known
him
through
them
all
,
to
be
,
according
to
his
quiet
ways
,
so
faithful
to
everything
honest
and
good
,
that
if
he
was
never
to
be
heard
of
more
,
and
I
was
to
live
to
be
a
hundred
years
old
<EOS>
,
I
could
say
with
my
last
breath
,
God
knows
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
once
left
trusting
Stephen
Blackpool
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
all
believe
,
up
at
the
Lodge
,
Rachael
,
that
he
will
be
freed
from
suspicion
,
sooner
or
later
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
better
I
know
it
to
be
so
believed
there
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Rachael
,
"
and
the
kinder
I
feel
it
that
you
come
away
from
there
,
purposely
to
comfort
me
,
and
keep
me
company
,
and
be
seen
wi
'
me
when
I
am
not
yet
free
from
all
suspicion
myself
,
the
more
grieved
<EOS>
I
am
that
I
should
ever
have
spoken
those
mistrusting
words
to
the
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
I
---
"
   
"
You
do
n't
mistrust
her
now
,
Rachael
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
that
you
have
brought
us
more
together
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
at
all
times
keep
out
of
my
mind
---
"
   
Her
voice
so
sunk
into
a
low
and
slow
communing
with
herself
,
that
Sissy
,
sitting
by
her
side
,
was
obliged
to
listen
with
attention
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
at
all
times
keep
out
of
my
mind
,
mistrustings
of
some
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
think
who
'
tis
<EOS>
,
I
ca
n't
think
how
or
why
it
may
be
done
,
but
I
mistrust
that
some
one
has
put
Stephen
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
I
mistrust
that
by
his
coming
back
of
his
own
accord
,
and
showing
himself
innocent
before
them
all
,
some
one
would
be
confounded
,
who
---
to
prevent
that
---
has
stopped
him
,
and
put
him
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
dreadful
thought
,
"
said
Sissy
,
turning
pale
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
dreadful
thought
to
think
he
may
be
murdered
.
"
   
<EOS>
Sissy
shuddered
,
and
turned
paler
yet
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
it
makes
its
way
into
my
mind
,
dear
,
"
said
Rachael
,
"
and
it
will
come
sometimes
,
though
I
do
all
I
can
to
keep
it
out
,
wi
'
counting
on
to
high
numbers
as
I
work
,
and
saying
over
and
over
again
pieces
that
I
knew
when
I
were
a
child
---
I
fall
into
such
a
wild
,
hot
hurry
,
that
,
however
tired
I
am
,
I
want
to
walk
fast
,
miles
and
miles
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
get
the
better
of
this
before
bed
-
time
.
<EOS>
I
'll
walk
home
wi

you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
might
fall
ill
upon
the
journey
back
,
"
said
Sissy
,
faintly
offering
a
worn
-
out
scrap
of
hope
;
"
and
in
such
a
case
,
there
are
many
places
on
the
road
where
he
might
stop
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
he
is
in
none
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
been
sought
for
in
all
,
and
he
's
not
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
was
Sissy
's

Her

adjusted
Rachael

upon

shining
black
hair
in

it

being
fine

little

They
were
by
this
time
in
the
street
where
Mr
Bounderby
's
house
stood
.
 
<EOS>
The
way
to
Sissy
's
destination
led
them
past
the
door
,
and
they
were
going
straight
towards
it
.
 
<EOS>
Some
train
had
newly
arrived
in
Coketown
,
which
had
put
a
number
of
vehicles
in
motion
,
and
scattered
a
considerable
bustle
about
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
Several
coaches
were
rattling
before
them
and
behind
them
as
they
approached
Mr
Bounderby
's
,
and
one
of
the
latter
drew
up
with
such
briskness
as
they
were
in
the
act
of
passing
the
house
,
that
they
looked
round
involuntarily
.
 
<EOS>
The
bright
gaslight
over
Mr
Bounderby
's
steps
showed
them
Mrs
Sparsit
in
the
coach
,
in
an
ecstasy
of
excitement
,
struggling
to
open
the
door
;
Mrs
Sparsit
seeing
them
at
the
same
moment
,
called
to
them
to
stop
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
coincidence
,
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Sparsit
,
as
she
was
released
by
the
coachman
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
Providence
!
 
<EOS>
Come
out
,
ma'am

"
<EOS>
then
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
to
some
one
inside
,
"
come
out
,
or
<EOS>
we
'll
have
you
dragged
out
!
"
   
<EOS>
Hereupon
,
no
other
than
the
mysterious
old
woman
descended
.
 
<EOS>
Whom
Mrs
Sparsit
incontinently
collared
.
   
<EOS>
"
Leave
her
alone
,
everybody
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs
Sparsit
,
with
great
energy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
nobody
touch
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
belongs
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Come
in
,
ma'am

"
<EOS>
then
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
reversing
her
former
word
of
command
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
ma'am
,
or
we
'll
have
you
dragged
in

<EOS>
The
spectacle
of
a
matron
of
classical
deportment
,
seizing
an
ancient
woman
by
the
throat
,
and
hauling
her
into
a
dwelling
-
house
,
would
have
been
under
any
circumstances
,
sufficient
temptation
to
all
true
English
stragglers
so
blest
as
to
witness
it
,
to
force
a
way
into
that
dwelling
-
house
and
see
the
matter
out
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
the
phenomenon
was
enhanced
by
the
notoriety
and
mystery
by
this
time
associated
all
over
the
town
with
the
Bank
robbery
,
it
would
have
lured
the
stragglers
in
,
with
an
irresistible
attraction
,
though
the
roof
had
been
expected
to
fall
upon
their
heads
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
the
chance
witnesses
on
the
ground
,
consisting
of
the
busiest
of
the
neighbours
to
the
number
of
some
five
-
and
-
twenty
,
closed
in
after
Sissy
and
Rachael
,
as
they
closed
in
after
Mrs
Sparsit
and
her
prize
;
and
the
whole
body
made
a
disorderly
irruption
into
Mr
Bounderby
's
dining
-
room
,
where
the
people
behind
lost
not
a
moment
's
time
in
mounting
on
the
chairs
,
to
get
the
better
of
the
people
in
front
.
   
<EOS>
"
Fetch
Mr
Bounderby
down
!
"
cried
Mrs
Sparsit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Rachael
,
young
woman
;
you
know
who
this
is
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
Mrs
Pegler
,
"
said
Rachael
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
it
is
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs
Sparsit
,
exulting
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fetch
Mr
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
Stand
away
,
everybody
!
"
 
<EOS>
Here
old
Mrs
Pegler
,
muffling
herself
up
,
and
shrinking
from
observation
,
whispered
a
word
of
entreaty
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
tell
me
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
you
twenty
times
,
coming
along
,
that
I
will
not
leave
you
till
I
have
handed
you
over
to
him
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
now
appeared
,
accompanied
by
Mr
Gradgrind
and
the
whelp
,
with
whom
he
had
been
holding
conference
up
-
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
looked
more
astonished
than
hospitable
,
at
sight
of
this
uninvited
party
in
his
dining
-
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
what
's
the
matter
now
!
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Sparsit
,
ma'am
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
explained
that
worthy
woman
,
"
I
trust
it
is
my
good
fortune
to
produce
a
person
you
have
much
desired
to
find
.
 
<EOS>
Stimulated
by
my
wish
to
relieve
your
mind
,
sir
,
and
connecting
together
such
imperfect
clues
to
the
part
of
the
country
in
which
that
person
might
be
supposed
to
reside
,
as
have
been
afforded
by
the
young
woman
,
Rachael
,
fortunately
now
present
to
identify
,
I
have
had
the
happiness
to
succeed
,
and
to
bring
that
person
with
me
---
I
need
not
say
most
unwillingly
on
her
part
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
not
been
,
sir
,
without
some
trouble
that
I
have
effected
this
;
but
trouble
in
your
service
is
to
me
a
pleasure
,
and
hunger
,
thirst
,
and
cold
a
real
gratification
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Mrs
Sparsit
ceased
;
for
Mr
Bounderby
's
visage
exhibited
an
extraordinary
combination
of
all
possible
colours
and
expressions
of
discomfiture
,
as
old
Mrs
Pegler
was
disclosed
to
his
view
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
do
you
mean
by
this
?
"
was
his
highly
unexpected
demand
,
in
great
warmth
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
,
what
do
you
mean
by
this
,
Mrs
Sparsit
,
ma'am
?
"
   
"
Sir
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Sparsit
,
faintly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
mind
your
own
business
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
roared
Bounderby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
dare
you
go
and
poke
your
officious
nose
into
my
family
affairs
?
"
   
<EOS>
This
allusion
to
her
favourite
feature
overpowered
Mrs
Sparsit
.
<EOS>
She
sat
down
stiffly
in
a
chair
,
as
if
she
were
frozen
;
and
with
a
fixed
stare
at
Mr
Bounderby
,
slowly
grated
her
mittens
against
one
another
,
as
if
they
were
frozen
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Josiah
!
"
cried
Mrs
Pegler
,
trembling
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
darling
boy
!
<EOS>
I
am
not
to
blame
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
my
fault
,
Josiah
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
this
lady
over
and
over
again
,
that
I
knew
she
was
doing
what
would
not
be
agreeable
to
you
,
but
she
would
do
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
let
her
bring
you
for
?
 
<EOS>
Could
n't
you
knock
her
cap
off
,
or
her
tooth
out
,
or
scratch
her
,
or
do
something
or
other
to
her
?
"
asked
Bounderby
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
own
boy
!
 
<EOS>
She
threatened
me
that
if
I
resisted
her
,
I
should
be
brought
by
constables
,
and
it
was
better
to
come
quietly
than
make
that
stir
in
such
a

---
Mrs
 
Pegler
glanced
timidly
but
proudly
round
the
walls
---
"
such
a
fine
house
as
this

<EOS>
Indeed
,
indeed
,
it
is
not
my
fault

<EOS>
My
dear

noble
,
stately
boy

<EOS>
I
have
always
lived
quiet

and
secret

Josiah

my
dear

<EOS>
I
have
never
broken
the
condition
once

<EOS>
I
have
never
said
I
was
your
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
admired
you
at
a
distance
;
and
if
I
have
come
to
town
sometimes
,
with
long
times
between
,
to
take
a
proud
peep
at
you
,
I
have
done
it
unbeknown
,
my
love
,
and
gone
away
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
walked
in
impatient
mortification
up
and
down
at
the
side
of
the
long
dining
-
table
,
while
the
spectators
greedily
took
in
every
syllable
of
Mrs
Pegler
's
appeal
,
and
at
each
succeeding
syllable
became
more
and
more
round
-
eyed
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
still
walking
up
and
down
when
Mrs
Pegler
had
done
,
Mr
Gradgrind
addressed
that
maligned
old
lady
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
surprised
,
madam
,
"
he
observed
with
severity
,
"
that
in
your
old
age
you
have
the
face
to
claim
Mr
Bounderby
for
your
son
,
after
your
unnatural
and
inhuman
treatment
of
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Me
unnatural
!
"
<EOS>
cried
poor
old
Mrs
Pegler
.
 
<EOS>
"
Me
inhuman
!
 
<EOS>
To
my
dear
boy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
!

repeated
Mr
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
dear
in
his
self
-
made
prosperity
,
madam
,
I
dare
say
.
 
<EOS>
Not
very
dear
,
however
,
when
you
deserted
him
in
his
infancy
,
and
left
him
to
the
brutality
of
a
drunken
grandmother
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
deserted
my
Josiah
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs
Pegler
,
clasping
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
Lord
forgive
you
,
sir
,
for
your
wicked
imaginations
,
and
for
your
scandal
against
the
memory
of
my
poor
mother
,
who
died
in
my
arms
before
Josiah
was
born
.
 
<EOS>
May
you
repent
of
it
,
sir

and
live
to
know
better

<EOS>
She
was
so
very
earnest
and
injured
,
that
Mr
Gradgrind
,
shocked
by
the
possibility
which
dawned
upon
him
,
said
in
a
gentler
tone
:
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
deny
,
then
,
madam

left
your

gutter

"

exclaimed
Mrs

"
No

Never

For
shame

My

give

though
he
come
of
humble
parents

he
come
of
parents
that
loved
him
as
dear
as
the
best
could

and
never
thought
it
hardship
on
themselves
to
pinch
a
bit

he
might
write

cipher
beautiful

and
I

his
books
at

show
it

Aye

said
Mrs
Pegler
,
with
indignant
pride
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
my

knows

and
will
give

that
after
his
beloved
father
died
,
when
he
was
eight
years
old

his
mother
,
too

could
pinch
a
bit

as
it
was
her
duty

her
pleasure

her
pride

do
it

And
a

he
was

well

forward

be
rich

thriving

And
I
'll
give
you
to
know

for
this

that
though
his

kept

a

he
never
forgot
her

pensioned
me
on
thirty
pound
a
year

more
than
I
want

I
put
by
out
of

only
making
the
condition

I

down
in

make
no

about
him

not
trouble
him

And
I
never
have

except
with
looking
at
him
once
a
year
,
when
he
has
never
knowed
it

And
it
's
right

said
poor
old
Mrs

,
in
affectionate
championship

that
I
should
keep
down
in
my
own
part

and
I
have
no
doubts
that
if
I
was
here
I
should
do
a
many
unbefitting
things
,
and
I
am
well
contented

and
I
can
keep
my
pride
in
my
Josiah
to
myself
,

I
can
love
for
love
's
own
sake
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
am
ashamed
of
you
,
sir

said
Mrs
Pegler
,
lastly
,
"
for
your
slanders
and
suspicions
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
never
stood
here
before

nor
never
wanted
to
stand
here
when
my
dear
son
said
no

And
I
should
n't
be
here
now

if
it
had
n't
been
for
being
brought
here

<EOS>
And
for
shame
upon
you
,
Oh

for
shame

to
accuse
me
of
being
a
bad
mother
to
my
son

my

so
different

<EOS>
The
bystanders
,
on
and
off
the
dining
-
room
chairs
,
raised
a
murmur
of
sympathy
with
Mrs
Pegler
,
and
Mr
Gradgrind
felt
himself
innocently
placed
in
a
very
distressing
predicament
,
when
Mr
Bounderby
,
who
had
never
ceased
walking
up
and
down
,
and
had
every
moment
swelled
larger
and
larger
,
and
grown
redder
and
redder
,
stopped
short
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
exactly
know

"
said
Mr
Bounderby
,
"
how
I
come
to
be
favoured
with
the
attendance

the
present
company

I
do

inquire

<EOS>
When

perhaps
they
'll

In

Although
Mr
Bounderby
carried
it
off
in
these
terms
,
holding
the
door
open
for
the
company
to
depart
,
there
was
a
blustering
sheepishness
upon
him
,
at
once
extremely
crestfallen
and
superlatively
absurd
.
 
<EOS>
Detected
as
the
Bully
of
humility
,
who
had
built
his
windy
reputation
upon
lies
,
and
in
his
boastfulness
had
put
the
honest
truth
as
far
away
from
him
as
if
he
had
advanced
the
mean
claim
<EOS>
(
there
is
no
meaner
)
to
tack
himself
on
to
a
pedigree
,
he
cut
a
most
ridiculous
figure
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
people
filing
off
at
the
door
he
held
,
who
he
knew
would
carry
what
had
passed
to
the
whole
town
,
to
be
given
to
the
four
winds
,
he
could
not
have
looked
a
Bully
more
shorn
and
forlorn
,
if
he
had
had
his
ears
cropped
.
 
<EOS>
Even
that
unlucky
female
,
Mrs
Sparsit
,
fallen
from
her
pinnacle
of
exultation
into
the
Slough
of
Despond
,
was
not
in
so
bad
a
plight
as
that
remarkable
man
and
self
-
made
Humbug
,
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
.
   
<EOS>
Rachael
and
Sissy
,
leaving
Mrs
Pegler
to
occupy
a
bed
at
her
son
's
for
that
night
,
walked
together
to
the
gate
of
Stone
Lodge
and
there
parted
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
joined
them
before
they
had
gone
very
far
,
and
spoke
with
much
interest
of
Stephen
Blackpool
;
for
whom
he
thought
this
signal
failure
of
the
suspicions
against
Mrs
Pegler
was
likely
to
work
well
.
   
<EOS>
As
to
the
whelp
;
throughout
this
scene
as
on
all
other
late
occasions
,
he
had
stuck
close
to
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
feel
that
as
long
as
Bounderby
could
make
no
discovery
without
his
knowledge
,
he
was
so
far
safe
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
visited
his
sister
,
and
had
only
seen
her
once
since
she
went
home
:
 
<EOS>
that
is
to
say
on
the
night
when
he
still
stuck
close
to
Bounderby
,
as
already
related
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
one
dim
unformed
fear
lingering
about
his
sister
's
mind
,
to
which
she
never
gave
utterance
,
which
surrounded
the
graceless
and
ungrateful
boy
with
a
dreadful
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
The
same
dark
possibility
had
presented
itself
in
the
same
shapeless
guise
,
this
very
day
,
to
Sissy
,
when
Rachael
spoke
of
some
one
who
would
be
confounded
by
Stephen
's
return
,
having
put
him
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
Louisa
had
never
spoken
of
harbouring
any
suspicion
of
her
brother
in
connexion
with
the
robbery
,
she
and
Sissy
had
held
no
confidence
on
the
subject
,
save
in
that
one
interchange
of
looks
when
the
unconscious
father
rested
his
gray
head
on
his
hand
;
but
it
was
understood
between
them
,
and
they
both
knew
it
.
 
<EOS>
This
other
fear
was
so
awful
,
that
it
hovered
about
each
of
them
like
a
ghostly
shadow
;
neither
daring
to
think
of
its
being
near
herself
,
far
less
of
its
being
near
the
other
.
   
<EOS>
And
still
the
forced
spirit
which
the
whelp
had
plucked
up
,
throve
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
If
Stephen
Blackpool
was
not
the
thief
,
let
him
show
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
he
?
   
<EOS>
Another
night

Another
day
and
night

<EOS>
No
Stephen

Where
was
the
man
,
and
why
did
he
not
come
back

The
Starlight
 
<EOS>
The
Sunday
was
a
bright
Sunday
in
autumn
,
clear
and
cool
,
when
early
in
the
morning
Sissy
and
Rachael
met
,
to
walk
in
the
country
.
   
<EOS>
As
Coketown
cast
ashes
not
only
on
its
own
head
but
on
the
neighbourhood
's
too
---
after
the
manner
of
those
pious
persons
who
do
penance
for
their
own
sins
by
putting
other
people
into
sackcloth
---
it
was
customary
for
those
who
now
and
then
thirsted
for
a
draught
of
pure
air
,
which
is
not
absolutely
the
most
wicked
among
the
vanities
of
life
,
to
get
a
few
miles
away
by
the
railroad
,
and
then
begin
their
walk
,
or
their
lounge
in
the
fields
.
<EOS>
Sissy
and
Rachael
helped
themselves
out
of
the
smoke
by
the
usual
means
,
and
were
put
down
at
a
station
about
midway
between
the
town
and
Mr
Bounderby
's
retreat
.
   
<EOS>
Though
the
green
landscape
was
blotted
here
and
there
with
heaps
of
coal
,
it
was
green
elsewhere
,
and
there
were
trees
to
see
,
and
there
were
larks
singing
(
though
it
was
Sunday
)
,
and
there
were
pleasant
scents
in
the
air
,
and
all
was
over
-
arched
by
a
bright
blue
sky
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
distance
one
way
,
Coketown
showed
as
a
black
mist
;
in
another
distance
hills
began
to
rise
;
in
a
third
,
there
was
a
faint
change
in
the
light
of
the
horizon
where
it
shone
upon
the
far
-
off
sea
.
 
<EOS>
Under
their
feet
,
the
grass
was
fresh
;
beautiful
shadows
of
branches
flickered
upon
it
,
and
speckled
it
;
hedgerows
were
luxuriant
;
everything
was
at
peace
.
 
<EOS>
Engines
at
pits
'
mouths
,
and
lean
old
horses
that
had
worn
the
circle
of
their
daily
labour
into
the
ground
,
were
alike
quiet
;
wheels
had
ceased
for
a
short
space
to
turn
;
and
the
great
wheel
of
earth
seemed
to
revolve
without
the
shocks
and
noises
of
another
time
.
   
<EOS>
They
walked
on
across
the
fields
and
down
the
shady
lanes
,
sometimes
getting
over
a
fragment
of
a
fence
so
rotten
that
it
dropped
at
a
touch
of
the
foot
,
sometimes
passing
near
a
wreck
of
bricks
and
beams
overgrown
with
grass
,
marking
the
site
of
deserted
works
.
 
<EOS>
They
followed
paths
and
tracks
,
however
slight
.
 
<EOS>
Mounds
where
the
grass
was
rank
and
high
,
and
where
brambles
,
dock
-
weed
,
and
such
-
like
vegetation
,
were
confusedly
heaped
together
,
they
always
avoided
;
for
dismal
stories
were
told
in
that
country
of
the
old
pits
hidden
beneath
such
indications
.
   
<EOS>
The
sun
was
high
when
they
sat
down
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
seen
no
one
,
near
or
distant
,
for
a
long
time
;
and
the
solitude
remained
unbroken
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
still
here
,
<EOS>
Rachael
,
and
the
way
is
so
untrodden
,
<EOS>
that
I
think
we
must
be
the
first
who
have
been
here
all
the
summer
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
Sissy
said
it
,
her
eyes
were
attracted
by
another
of
those
rotten
fragments
of
fence
upon
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
She
got
up
to
look
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
yet
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
This
has
not
been
broken
very
long
.
<EOS>
The
wood
is
quite
fresh
where
it
gave
way
.
 
<EOS>
Here
are
footsteps
too
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
O
Rachael
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
She
ran
back
,
and
caught
her
round
the
neck
.
 
<EOS>
Rachael
had
already
started
up
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
hat
lying
in
the
grass
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
went
forward
together
.
 
<EOS>
Rachael
took
it
up
,
shaking
from
head
to
foot
.
<EOS>
She
broke
into
a
passion
of
tears
and
lamentations
:
 
<EOS>
Stephen
Blackpool
was
written
in
his
own
hand
on
the
inside
.
   
<EOS>
"
O
the
poor
lad
,
the
poor
lad
!
 
<EOS>
He
has
been
made
away
with
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
lying
murdered
here
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
---
has
the
hat
any
blood
upon
it
?
"
<EOS>
Sissy
faltered
.
   
<EOS>
They
were
afraid
to
look
;
but
they
did
examine
it
,
and
found
no
mark
of
violence
,
inside
or
out
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
been
lying
there
some
days
,
for
rain
and
dew
had
stained
it
,
and
the
mark
of
its
shape
was
on
the
grass
where
it
had
fallen
.
 
<EOS>
They
looked
fearfully
about
them
,
without
moving
,
but
could
see
nothing
more
.
 
<EOS>
"
Rachael
,
"
Sissy
whispered
,
"
I
will
go
on
a
little
by
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
had
unclasped
her
hand
,
and
was
in
the
act
of
stepping
forward
,
when
Rachael
caught
her
in
both
arms
with
a
scream
that
resounded
over
the
wide
landscape
.
 
<EOS>
Before
them
,
at
their
very
feet
,
was
the
brink
of
a
black
ragged
chasm
hidden
by
the
thick
grass
.
 
<EOS>
They
sprang
back
,
and
fell
upon
their
knees
,
each
hiding
her
face
upon
the
other
's
neck
.
   
<EOS>
"
O
,
my
good
Lord
!
 
<EOS>
He
's
down
there
!
 
<EOS>
Down
there
!
"
 
At
first
this
,
and
her
terrific
screams
,
were
all
that
could
be
got
from
Rachael
,
by
any
tears
,
by
any
prayers
,
by
any
representations
,
by
any
means
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
hush
her
;
and
it
was
deadly
necessary
to
hold
her
,
or
she
would
have
flung
herself
down
the
shaft
.
   
<EOS>
"
Rachael
,
dear
Rachael
,
good
Rachael
,
for
the
love
of
Heaven
,
not
these
dreadful
cries
!
 
Think
of
Stephen
,
think
of
Stephen
,
think
of
Stephen
!
"
   
<EOS>
By
an
earnest
repetition
of
this
entreaty
,
poured
out
in
all
the
agony
of
such
a
moment
,
Sissy
at
last
brought
her
to
be
silent
,
and
to
look
at
her
with
a
tearless
face
of
stone
.
   
<EOS>
"
Rachael
,
Stephen
may
be
living
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
n't
leave
him
lying
maimed
at
the
bottom
of
this
dreadful
place
,
a
moment
,
if
you
could
bring
help
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
stir
from
here
,
for
his
sake
!
 
<EOS>
Let
me
go
and
listen
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
shuddered
to
approach
the
pit
;
but
she
crept
towards
it
on
her
hands
and
knees
,
and
called
to
him
as
loud
as
she
could
call
.
 
<EOS>
She
listened
,
but
no
sound
replied
.
 
<EOS>
She
called
again
and
listened
;
still
no
answering
sound
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
this
,
twenty
,
thirty
times
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
a
little
clod
of
earth
from
the
broken
ground
where
he
had
stumbled
,
and
threw
it
in
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
hear
it
fall
.
   
<EOS>
The
wide
prospect
,
so
beautiful
in
its
stillness
but
a
few
minutes
ago
,
almost
carried
despair
to
her
brave
heart
,
as
she
rose
and
looked
all
round
her
,
seeing
no
help
.
 
<EOS>
"
Rachael
,
we
must
lose
not
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
We
must
go
in
different
directions
,
seeking
aid
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
go
by
the
way
we
have
come
,
and
I
will
go
forward
by
the
path
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
any
one
you
see
,
and
every
one
what
has
happened
.
<EOS>
Think
of
Stephen
,
think
of
Stephen
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
knew
by
Rachael
's
face
that
she
might
trust
her
now
.
 
<EOS>
And
after
standing
for
a
moment
to
see
her
running
,
wringing
her
hands
as
she
ran
,
she
turned
and
went
upon
her
own
search
;
she
stopped
at
the
hedge
to
tie
her
shawl
there
as
a
guide
to
the
place
,
then
threw
her
bonnet
aside
,
and
ran
as
she
had
never
run
before
.
   
<EOS>
Run
,
Sissy
,
run
,
in
Heaven
's
name
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
stop
for
breath
.
 
<EOS>
Run
,
run
!
 
<EOS>
Quickening
herself
by
carrying
such
entreaties
in
her
thoughts
,
she
ran
from
field
to
field
,
and
lane
to
lane
,
and
place
to
place
,
as
she
had
never
run
before
;
until
she
came
to
a
shed
by
an
engine
-
house
,
where
two
men
lay
in
the
shade
,
asleep
on
straw
.
   
<EOS>
First
to
wake
them
,
and
next
to
tell
them
,
all
so
wild
and
breathless
as
she
was
,
what
had
brought
her
there
,
were
difficulties
;
but
they
no
sooner
understood
her
than
their
spirits
were
on
fire
like
hers
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
men
was
in
a
drunken
slumber
,
but
on
his
comrade
's
shouting
to
him
that
a
man
had
fallen
down
the
Old
Hell
Shaft
,
he
started
out
to
a
pool
of
dirty
water
,
put
his
head
in
it
,
and
came
back
sober
.
   
<EOS>
With
these
two
men
she
ran
to
another
half
-
a
-
mile
further
,
and
with
that
one
to
another
,
while
they
ran
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
Then
a
horse
was
found
;
and
she
got
another
man
to
ride
for
life
or
death
to
the
railroad
,
and
send
a
message
to
Louisa
,
which
she
wrote
and
gave
him
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
a
whole
village
was
up
:
 
and
windlasses
,
ropes
,
poles
,
candles
,
lanterns
,
all
things
necessary
,
were
fast
collecting
and
being
brought
into
one
place
,
to
be
carried
to
the
Old
Hell
Shaft
.
   
<EOS>
It
seemed
now
hours
and
hours
since
she
had
left
the
lost
man
lying
in
the
grave
where
he
had
been
buried
alive
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
bear
to
remain
away
from
it
any
longer
---
it
was
like
deserting
him
---
and
she
hurried
swiftly
back
,
accompanied
by
half
-
a
-
dozen
labourers
,
including
the
drunken
man
whom
the
news
had
sobered
,
and
who
was
the
best
man
of
all
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
came
to
the
Old
Hell
Shaft
,
they
found
it
as
lonely
as
she
had
left
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
called
and
listened
as
she
had
done
,
and
examined
the
edge
of
the
chasm
,
and
settled
how
it
had
happened
,
and
then
sat
down
to
wait
until
the
implements
they
wanted
should
come
up
.
   
<EOS>
Every
sound
of
insects
in
the
air
,
every
stirring
of
the
leaves
,
every
whisper
among
these
men
,
made
Sissy
tremble
,
for
she
thought
it
was
a
cry
at
the
bottom
of
the
pit
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
wind
blew
idly
over
it
,
and
no
sound
arose
to
the
surface
,
and
they
sat
upon
the
grass
,
waiting
and
waiting
.
 
<EOS>
After
they
had
waited
some
time
,
straggling
people
who
had
heard
of
the
accident
began
to
come
up
;
then
the
real
help
of
implements
began
to
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
this
,
Rachael
returned
;
and
with
her
party
there
was
a
surgeon
,
who
brought
some
wine
and
medicines
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
expectation
among
the
people
that
the
man
would
be
found
alive
was
very
slight
indeed
.
   
<EOS>
There
being
now
people
enough
present
to
impede
the
work
,
the
sobered
man
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
rest
,
or
was
put
there
by
the
general
consent
,
and
made
a
large
ring
round
the
Old
Hell
Shaft
,
and
appointed
men
to
keep
it
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
such
volunteers
as
were
accepted
to
work
,
only
Sissy
and
Rachael
were
at
first
permitted
within
this
ring
;
but
,
later
in
the
day
,
when
the
message
brought
an
express
from
Coketown
,
Mr
Gradgrind
and
Louisa
,
and
Mr
Bounderby
,
and
the
whelp
,
were
also
there
.
   
<EOS>
The
sun
was
four
hours
lower
than
when
Sissy
and
Rachael
had
first
sat
down
upon
the
grass
,
before
a
means
of
enabling
two
men
to
descend
securely
was
rigged
with
poles
and
ropes
.
 
<EOS>
Difficulties
had
arisen
in
the
construction
of
this
machine
,
simple
as
it
was
;
requisites
had
been
found
wanting
,
and
messages
had
had
to
go
and
return
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
of
the
bright
autumnal
Sunday
,
before
a
candle
was
sent
down
to
try
the
air
,
while
three
or
four
rough
faces
stood
crowded
close
together
,
attentively
watching
it
:
 
<EOS>
the
man
at
the
windlass
lowering
as
they
were
told
.
 
<EOS>
The
candle
was
brought
up
again
,
feebly
burning
,
and
then
some
water
was
cast
in
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
bucket
was
hooked
on
;
and
the
sobered
man
and
another
got
in
with
lights
,
giving
the
word
"
Lower
away
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
rope
went
out
,
tight
and
strained
,
and
the
windlass
creaked
,
there
was
not
a
breath
among
the
one
or
two
hundred
men
and
women
looking
on
,
that
came
as
it
was
wo
nt
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
The
signal
was
given
and
the
windlass
stopped
,
with
abundant
rope
to
spare
.
 
<EOS>
Apparently
so
long
an
interval
ensued
with
the
men
at
the
windlass
standing
idle
,
that
some
women
shrieked
that
another
accident
had
happened
!
<EOS>
But
the
surgeon
who
held
the
watch
,
declared
five
minutes
not
to
have
elapsed
yet
,
and
sternly
admonished
them
to
keep
silence
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
well
done
speaking
,
when
the
windlass
was
reversed
and
worked
again
.
 
<EOS>
Practised
eyes
knew
that
it
did
not
go
as
heavily
as
it
would
if
both
workmen
had
been
coming
up
,
and
that
only
one
was
returning
.
   
<EOS>
The
rope
came
in
tight
and
strained
;
and
ring
after
ring
was
coiled
upon
the
barrel
of
the
windlass
,
and
all
eyes
were
fastened
on
the
pit
.
 
<EOS>
The
sobered
man
was
brought
up
and
leaped
out
briskly
on
the
grass
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
universal
cry
of
"
Alive
or
dead
?
"
<EOS>
and
then
a
deep
,
profound
hush
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
said
"
Alive
!
"
<EOS>
a
great
shout
arose
and
many
eyes
had
tears
in
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
he
's
hurt
very
bad
,
"
he
added
,
as
soon
as
he
could
make
himself
heard
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
's
doctor
?
 
<EOS>
He
's
hurt
so
very
bad
,
sir
,
that
we
donno
how
to
get
him
up
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
all
consulted
together
,
and
looked
anxiously
at
the
surgeon
,
as
he
asked
some
questions
,
and
shook
his
head
on
receiving
the
replies
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
was
setting
now
;
and
the
red
light
in
the
evening
sky
touched
every
face
there
,
and
caused
it
to
be
distinctly
seen
in
all
its
rapt
suspense
.
   
<EOS>
The
consultation
ended
in
the
men
returning
to
the
windlass
,
and
the
pitman
going
down
again
,
carrying
the
wine
and
some
other
small
matters
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
other
man
came
up
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
under
the
surgeon
's
directions
,
some
men
brought
a
hurdle
,
on
which
others
made
a
thick
bed
of
spare
clothes
covered
with
loose
straw
,
while
he
himself
contrived
some
bandages
and
slings
from
shawls
and
handkerchiefs
.
 
<EOS>
As
these
were
made
,
they
were
hung
upon
an
arm
of
the
pitman
who
had
last
come
up
,
with
instructions
how
to
use
them
:
and
as
he
stood
,
shown
by
the
light
he
carried
,
leaning
his
powerful
loose
hand
upon
one
of
the
poles
,
and
sometimes
glancing
down
the
pit
,
and
sometimes
glancing
round
upon
the
people
,
he
was
not
the
least
conspicuous
figure
in
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
dark
now
,
and
torches
were
kindled
.
   
<EOS>
It
appeared
from
the
little
this
man
said
to
those
about
him
,
which
was
quickly
repeated
all
over
the
circle
,
that
the
lost
man
had
fallen
upon
a
mass
of
crumbled
rubbish
with
which
the
pit
was
half
choked
up
,
and
that
his
fall
had
been
further
broken
by
some
jagged
earth
at
the
side
.
 
<EOS>
He
lay
upon
his
back
with
one
arm
doubled
under
him
,
and
according
to
his
own
belief
had
hardly
stirred
since
he
fell
,
except
that
he
had
moved
his
free
hand
to
a
side
pocket
,
in
which
he
remembered
to
have
some
bread
and
meat
(
of
which
he
had
swallowed
crumbs
)
,
and
had
likewise
scooped
up
a
little
water
in
it
now
and
then
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
come
straight
away
from
his
work
,
on
being
written
to
,
and
had
walked
the
whole
journey
;
and
was
on
his
way
to
Mr
Bounderby
's
country
house
after
dark
,
when
he
fell
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
crossing
that
dangerous
country
at
such
a
dangerous
time
,
because
he
was
innocent
of
what
was
laid
to
his
charge
,
and
could
n't
rest
from
coming
the
nearest
way
to
deliver
himself
up
.
 
<EOS>
The
Old
Hell
Shaft
,
the
pitman
said
,
with
a
curse
upon
it
,
was
worthy
of
its
bad
name
to
the
last
;
for
though
Stephen
could
speak
now
,
he
believed
it
would
soon
be
found
to
have
mangled
the
life
out
of
him
.
   
<EOS>
When
all
was
ready
,
this
man
,
still
taking
his
last
hurried
charges
from
his
comrades
and
the
surgeon
after
the
windlass
had
begun
to
lower
him
,
disappeared
into
the
pit
.
 
<EOS>
The
rope
went
out
as
before
,
the
signal
was
made
as
before
,
and
the
windlass
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
No
man
removed
his
hand
from
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
Every
one
waited
with
his
grasp
set
,
and
his
body
bent
down
to
the
work
,
ready
to
reverse
and
wind
in
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
signal
was
given
,
and
all
the
ring
leaned
forward
.
   
<EOS>
For
,
now
,
the
rope
came
in
,
tightened
and
strained
to
its
utmost
as
it
appeared
,
and
the
men
turned
heavily
,
and
the
windlass
complained
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
scarcely
endurable
to
look
at
the
rope
,
and
think
of
its
giving
way
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
ring
after
ring
was
coiled
upon
the
barrel
of
the
windlass
safely
,
and
the
connecting
chains
appeared
,
and
finally
the
bucket
with
the
two
men
holding
on
at
the
sides
---
a
sight
to
make
the
head
swim
,
and
oppress
the
heart
---
and
tenderly
supporting
between
them
,
slung
and
tied
within
,
the
figure
of
a
poor
,
crushed
,
human
creature
.
   
<EOS>
A
low
murmur
of
pity
went
round
the
throng
,
and
the
women
wept
aloud
,
as
this
form
,
almost
without
form
,
was
moved
very
slowly
from
its
iron
deliverance
,
and
laid
upon
the
bed
of
straw
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
none
but
the
surgeon
went
close
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
what
he
could
in
its
adjustment
on
the
couch
,
but
the
best
that
he
could
do
was
to
cover
it
.
 
<EOS>
That
gently
done
,
he
called
to
him
Rachael
and
Sissy
.
<EOS>
And
at
that
time
the
pale
,
worn
,
patient
face
was
seen
looking
up
at
the
sky
,
with
the
broken
right
hand
lying
bare
on
the
outside
of
the
covering
garments
,
as
if
waiting
to
be
taken
by
another
hand
.
   
<EOS>
They
gave
him
drink
,
moistened
his
face
with
water
,
and
administered
some
drops
of
cordial
and
wine
.
 
<EOS>
Though
he
lay
quite
motionless
looking
up
at
the
sky
,
he
smiled
and
said
,
"
Rachael
.
"
<EOS>
She
stooped
down
on
the
grass
at
his
side
,
and
bent
over
him
until
her
eyes
were
between
his
and
the
sky
,
for
he
could
not
so
much
as
turn
them
to
look
at
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Rachael
,
my
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
took
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
smiled
again
and
said
,
"
Do
n't
let
'
t
go
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thou'rt
in
great
pain
,
my
own
dear
Stephen
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I

Ah

<EOS>
Fro

"
   
<EOS>
The
spectre
of
his
old
look
seemed
to
pass
as
he
said
the
word
.
   
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
He
faintly
said
it
,
without
any
anger
against
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
Merely
as
the
truth
.
   
<EOS>

<EOS>
Louisa
approached
him
;
but
he
could
not
see
her
,
lying
with
his
face
turned
up
to
the
night
sky
.
   
<EOS>
"

Following
his
eyes
,
she
saw
that

was
gazing
at
a
star

"

Louisa
hearing
what
he
said
,
bent
over
him
on
the
opposite
side
to
Rachael
,
so
that
he
could
see
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
You

he
said
,
after

with

<EOS>
"
Shall

"
   
<EOS>
"
If

<EOS>
"
   
Louisa
returned
with
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
Standing
hand
-
in
-
hand
,
they
both
looked
down
upon
the
solemn
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
was
troubled
and
asked
how
?
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
was
the
reply
:
 
"

<EOS>
The
bearers
being
now
ready
to
carry
him
away
,
and
the
surgeon
being
anxious
for
his
removal
,
those
who
had
torches
or
lanterns
,
prepared
to
go
in
front
of
the
litter
.
 
<EOS>
Before
it
was
raised
,
and
while
they
were
arranging
how
to
go
,
he
said
to
Rachael
,
looking
upward
at
the
star
:
   
<EOS>
"
Often
as
I
coom
to
myseln
,
and
found
it
shinin
'
on

down

in

I
thowt
it

Our
Saviour
's
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
awmust
think
it
be
the
very
star
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
lifted
him
up
,
and
he
was
overjoyed
to
find
that
they
were
about
to
take
him
in
the
direction
<EOS>
whither
<EOS>
the
star
seemed
to
him
to
lead
.
   
<EOS>
"
Rachael
,
beloved
lass
!
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
go
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
We
may
walk
toogether
t'night

my

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
hold
thy

,
and
keep
beside
thee
,
Stephen

all
the
way
.

<EOS>
"
Bless
thee
!
 
<EOS>
Will
soombody
be
pleased
to
coover
my

"
   
<EOS>
They
carried
him
very
gently
along
the
fields
,
and
down
the
lanes
,
and
over
the
wide
landscape
;
Rachael
always
holding
the
hand
in
hers
.
 
<EOS>
Very
few
whispers
broke
the
mournful
silence
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
soon
a
funeral
procession
.
 
<EOS>
The
star
had
shown
him
where
to
find
the
God
of
the
poor
;
and
through
humility
,
and
sorrow
,
and
forgiveness
,
he
had
gone
to
his
Redeemer
's
rest

WHELP
-
HUNTING
 
<EOS>
Before
the
ring
formed
round
<EOS>
the
Old
Hell
Shaft
was
broken
,
one
figure
had
disappeared
from
within
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
and
his
shadow
had
not
stood
near
Louisa
,
who
held
her
father
's
arm
,
but
in
a
retired
place
by
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
When
Mr
Gradgrind
was
summoned
to
the
couch
,
Sissy
,
attentive
to
all
that
happened
,
slipped
behind
that
wicked
shadow
---
a
sight
in
the
horror
of
his
face
,
if
there
had
been
eyes
there
for
any
sight
but
one
---
and
whispered
in
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
Without
turning
his
head
,
he
conferred
with
her
a
few
moments
,
and
vanished
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
the
whelp
had
gone
out
of
the
circle
before
the
people
moved
.
   
<EOS>
When
the
father
reached
home
,
he
sent
a
message
to
Mr
Bounderby
's
,
desiring
his
son
to
come
to
him
directly
.
 
<EOS>
The
reply
was
,
that
Mr
Bounderby
having
missed
him
in
the
crowd
,
and
seeing
nothing
of
him
since
,
had
supposed
him
to
be
at
Stone
Lodge
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
father
,
"
said
Louisa
,
"
he
will
not
come
back
to
town
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
turned
away
,
and
said
no
more
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
morning
,
he
went
down
to
the
Bank
himself
as
soon
as
it
was
opened
,
and
seeing
his
son
's
place
empty
(
he
had
not
the
courage
to
look
in
at
first
)
went
back
along
the
street
to
meet
Mr
Bounderby
on
his
way
there
.
 
<EOS>
To
whom
he
said
that
,
for
reasons
he
would
soon
explain
,
but
entreated
not
then
to
be
asked
for
,
he
had
found
it
necessary
to
employ
his
son
at
a
distance
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
Also
,
that
he
was
charged
with
the
duty
of
vindicating
Stephen
Blackpool
's
memory
,
and
declaring
the
thief
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
quite
confounded
,
stood
stock
-
still
in
the
street
after
his
father
-
in
-
law
had
left
him
,
swelling
like
an
immense
soap
-
bubble
,
without
its
beauty
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
went
home
,
locked
himself
in
his
room
,
and
kept
it
all
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
When
Sissy
and
Louisa
tapped
at
his
door
,
he
said
,
without
opening
it
,
"
Not
now
,
my
dears
;
in
the
evening
.
"
 
<EOS>
On
their
return
in
the
evening
,
he
said
,
"
I
am
not
able
yet
---
to
-
morrow
.
"
<EOS>
He
ate
nothing
all
day
,
and
had
no
candle
after
dark
;
and
they
heard
him
walking
to
and
fro
late
at
night
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
in
the
morning
he
appeared
at
breakfast
at
the
usual
hour
,
and
took
his
usual
place
at
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
Aged
and
bent
he
looked
,
and
quite
bowed
down
;
and
yet
he
looked
a
wiser
man
,
and
a
better
man
,
than
in
the
days
when
in
this
life
he
wanted
nothing
---
but
Facts
.
<EOS>
Before
he
left
the
room
,
he
appointed
a
time
for
them
to
come
to
him
;
and
so
,
with
his
gray
head
drooping
,
went
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
father
,
"
said
Louisa
,
when
they
kept
their
appointment
,
"
you
have
three
young
children
left
.
 
<EOS>
They
will
be
different
<EOS>
,
I
will
be
different
yet
,
with
Heaven
's
help
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
gave
her
hand
to
Sissy
,
as
if
she
meant
with
her
help
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
wretched
brother
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
he
had
planned
this
robbery
,
when
he
went
with
you
to
the
lodging
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
fear
so
,
father
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
he
had
wanted
money
very
much
,
and
had
spent
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
poor
man
being
about
to
leave
the
town
,
it
came
into
his
evil
brain
to
cast
suspicion
on
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
must
have
flashed
upon
him
while
he
sat
there
,
father
.
<EOS>
For
I
asked
him
to
go
there
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
visit
did
not
originate
with
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
had
some
conversation
with
the
poor
man
.
 
<EOS>
Did
he
take
him
aside
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
took
him
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
him
afterwards
,
why
he
had
done
so
,
and
he
made
a
plausible
excuse
;
but
since
last
night
,
father
,
and
when
I
remember
the
circumstances
by
its
light
,
I
am
afraid
I
can
imagine
too
truly
what
passed
between
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
know
,
"
said
her
father
,
"
if
your
thoughts
present
your
guilty
brother
in
the
same
dark
view
as
mine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
fear
,
father
,
"
hesitated
Louisa
,
"
that
he
must
have
made
some
representation
to
Stephen
Blackpool
---
perhaps
in
my
name
,
perhaps
in
his
own
---
which
induced
him
to
do
in
good
faith
and
honesty
,
what
he
had
never
done
before
,
and
to
wait
about
the
Bank
those
two
or
three
nights
before
he
left
the
town
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Too
plain
!
"
returned
the
father
.
 
<EOS>
"
Too
plain
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
shaded
his
face
,
and
remained
silent
for
some
moments
.
<EOS>
Recovering
himself
,
he
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
how
is
he
to
be
found
?
 
<EOS>
How
is
he
to
be
saved
from
justice
?
 
<EOS>
In
the
few
hours
that
I
can
possibly
allow
to
elapse
before
I
publish
the
truth
,
how
is
he
to
be
found
by
us
,
and
only
by
us
?
 
<EOS>
Ten
thousand
pounds
could
not
effect
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Sissy
has
effected
it
,
father
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
raised
his
eyes
to
where
she
stood
,
like
a
good
fairy
in
his
house
,
and
said
in
a
tone
of
softened
gratitude
and
grateful
kindness
,
"
It
is
always
you
,
my
child
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
had
our
fears
,
"
Sissy
explained
,
glancing
at
Louisa
,
"
before
yesterday
;
and
when
I
saw
you
brought
to
the
side
of
the
litter
last
night
,
and
heard
what
passed
(
being
close
to
Rachael
all
the
time
)
,
I
went
to
him
when
no
one
saw
,
and
said
to
him
,
"
Do
n't
look
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
See
where
your
father
is
.
 
<EOS>
Escape
at
once
,
for
his
sake
and
your
own
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
a
tremble
before
I
whispered
to
him
,
and
he
started
and
trembled
more
then
,
and
said
,
"
Where
can
I
go
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
very
little
money
,
and
I
do
n't
know
who
will
hide
me
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
thought
of
father
's
old
circus
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
forgotten
where
Mr
Sleary
goes
at
this
time
of
year
,
and
I
read
of
him
in
a
paper
only
the
other
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
to
hurry
there
,
and
tell
his
name
,
and
ask
Mr
Sleary
to
hide
him
till
I
came
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
get
to
him
before
the
morning
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
saw
him
shrink
away
among
the
people
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
Heaven
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
may
be
got
abroad
yet
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
more
hopeful
as
the
town
to
which
Sissy
had
directed
him
was
within
three
hours
'
journey
of
Liverpool
,
whence
<EOS>
he
could
be
swiftly
dispatched
to
any
part
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
caution
being
necessary
in
communicating
with
him
---
for
there
was
a
greater
danger
every
moment
of
his
being
suspected
now
,
and
nobody
could
be
sure
at
heart
but
that
Mr
Bounderby
himself
,
in
a
bullying
vein
of
public
zeal
,
might
play
a
Roman
part
<EOS>
---
it
was
consented
that
Sissy
and
Louisa
should
repair
to
the
place
in
question
,
by
a
circuitous
course
,
alone
;
and
that
the
unhappy
father
,
setting
forth
in
an
opposite
direction
,
should
get
round
to
the
same
bourne
by
another
and
wider
route
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
further
agreed
that
he
should
not
present
himself
to
Mr
Sleary
,
lest
his
intentions
should
be
mistrusted
,
or
the
intelligence
of
his
arrival
should
cause
his
son
to
take
flight
anew
;
but
,
that
the
communication
should
be
left
to
Sissy
and
Louisa
to
open
;
and
that
they
should
inform
the
cause
of
so
much
misery
and
disgrace
,
of
his
father
's
being
at
hand
and
of
the
purpose
for
which
they
had
come
.
 
<EOS>
When
these
arrangements
had
been
well
considered
and
were
fully
understood
by
all
three
,
it
was
time
to
begin
to
carry
them
into
execution
.
 
<EOS>
Early
in
the
afternoon
,
Mr
Gradgrind
walked
direct
from
his
own
house
into
the
country
,
to
be
taken
up
on
the
line
by
which
he
was
to
travel
;
and
at
night
the
remaining
two
set
forth
upon
their
different
course
,
encouraged
by
not
seeing
any
face
they
knew
.
   
<EOS>
The
two
travelled
all
night
,
except
when
they
were
left
,
for
odd
numbers
of
minutes
,
at
branch
-
places
,
up
illimitable
flights
of
steps
,
or
down
wells
---
which
was
the
only
variety
of
those
branches
---
and
,
early
in
the
morning
,
were
turned
out
on
a
swamp
,
a
mile
or
two
from
the
town
they
sought
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
dismal
spot
they
were
rescued
by
a
savage
old
postilion
,
who
happened
to
be
up
early
,
kicking
a
horse
in
a
fly
:
 
and
so
were
smuggled
into
the
town
by
all
the
back
lanes
where
the
pigs
lived
:
 
which
,
although
not
a
magnificent
or
even
savoury
approach
,
was
,
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
,
the
legitimate
highway
.
   
<EOS>
The
first
thing
they
saw
on
entering
the
town
was
the
skeleton
of
Sleary
's
Circus
.
 
<EOS>
The
company
had
departed
for
another
town
more
than
twenty
miles
off
,
and
had
opened
there
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
connection
between
the
two
places
was
by
a
hilly
turnpike
-
road
,
and
the
travelling
on
that
road
was
very
slow
.
 
<EOS>
Though
they
took
but
a
hasty
breakfast
,
and
no
rest
(
which
it
would
have
been
in
vain
to
seek
under
such
anxious
circumstances
)
,
it
was
noon
before
they
began
to
find
the
bills
of
Sleary
's
Horse
-
riding
on
barns
and
walls
,
and
one
o'clock
when
they
stopped
in
the
market
-
place
.
   
<EOS>
A
Grand
Morning
Performance
by
the
Riders
,
commencing
at
that
very
hour
,
was
in
course
of
announcement
by
the
bellman
as
they
set
their
feet
upon
the
stones
of
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
Sissy
recommended
that
,
to
avoid
making
inquiries
and
attracting
attention
in
the
town
,
they
should
present
themselves

<EOS>
If
Mr
Sleary
were
taking
the
money
,
he
would
be
sure
to
know
her
,
and
would
proceed
with
discretion
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
were
not
,
he
would
be
sure
to
see
them
inside
;
and
,
knowing
what
he
had
done
with
the
fugitive
,
would
proceed
with
discretion
still
.
   
<EOS>
Therefore
,
they
repaired
,
with
fluttering
hearts
,
to
the
well

remembered
booth
.
 
<EOS>
The
flag
with
the
inscription
<EOS>
SLEARY
'S
HORSE

RIDING
was
there
;
and
the

Mr

was
not
there

<EOS>
Master
Kidderminster
,
grown
too
maturely
turfy
to
be
received
by
the
wildest
credulity
as
Cupid
any
more
,
had
yielded
to
the
invincible
force
of
circumstances
(
and
his
beard
)
,
and
,
in
the
capacity
of
a
man
who
made
himself
generally
useful
,
presided
on
this
occasion
over
the
exchequer
---
having
also
a
drum
in
reserve
,
on
which
to
expend
his
leisure
moments
and
superfluous
forces
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
extreme
sharpness
of
his
look
out
for
base
coin
,
Mr
Kidderminster
,
as
at
present
situated
,
never
saw
anything
but
money
;
so
Sissy
passed
him
unrecognised
,
and
they
went
in
.
   
<EOS>
The
Emperor
of
Japan
,
on
a
steady
old
white
horse
stencilled
with
black
spots
,
was
twirling
five
wash
-
hand
basins
at
once
,
as
it
is
the
favourite
recreation
of
that
monarch
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Sissy
,
though
well
acquainted
with
his
Royal
line
,
had
no
personal
knowledge
of
the
present
Emperor
,
and
his
reign
was
peaceful
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Josephine
Sleary
,
in
her
celebrated
graceful
Equestrian
Tyrolean
Flower
Act
,
was
then
announced
by
a
new
clown
(
who
humorously
said
Cauliflower
Act
)
,
and
Mr
Sleary
appeared
,
leading
her
in
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sleary
had
only
made
one
cut
at
the
Clown
with
his
long
whip
-
lash
,
and
the
Clown
had
only
said
,
"
If
you
do
it
again
,
I
'll
throw
the
horse
at
you
!
"
<EOS>
when
Sissy
was
recognised
both
by
father
and
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
got
through
the
Act
with
great
self
-
possession
;
and
Mr
Sleary
,
saving
for
the
first
instant
,
conveyed
no
more
expression
into
his
locomotive
eye
than
into
his
fixed
one
.
 
<EOS>
The
performance
seemed
a
little
long
to
Sissy
and
Louisa
,
particularly
when
it
stopped
to
afford
the
Clown
an
opportunity
of
telling
Mr
Sleary
(
who
said
"
Indeed
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
to
all
his
observations
in
the
calmest
way
,
and
with
his
eye
on
the
house
)
about
two
legs
sitting
on
three
legs
looking
at
one
leg
,
when
in
came
four
legs
,
and
laid
hold
of
one
leg
,
and
up
got
two
legs
,
caught
hold
of
three
legs
,
and
threw
'em
at
four
legs
,
who
ran
away
with
one
leg
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
although
an
ingenious
Allegory
relating
to
a
butcher
,
a
three
-
legged
stool
,
a
dog
,
and
a
leg
of
mutton
,
this
narrative
consumed
time
;
and
they
were
in
great
suspense
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
however
,
little
fair
-
haired
Josephine
made
her
curtsey
amid
great
applause
;
and
the
Clown
,
left
alone
in
the
ring
,
had
just
warmed
himself
,
and
said
,
"
Now
I
'll
have
a
turn
!
"
<EOS>
when
Sissy
was
touched
on
the
shoulder
,
and
beckoned
out
.
   
<EOS>
She
took
Louisa
with
her
;
and
they
were
received
by
Mr
Sleary
in
a
very
little
private
apartment
,
with
canvas
sides
,
a
grass
floor
,
and
a
wooden
ceiling
all
aslant
,
on
which
the
box
company
stamped
their
approbation
,
as
if
they
were
coming
through
.

"

These
various
changes
,
Mr
Sleary
,
very
short
of
breath
now
,
related
with
great
heartiness
,
and
with
a
wonderful
kind
of
innocence
,
considering
what
a
bleary
and
brandy
-
and
-
watery
old
veteran
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
Afterwards
he
brought
in
Josephine

E*W*B
Childers

rather
deeply
lined
in

jaws
by
daylight
)
,
and
the
Little
Wonder
of
Scholastic
Equitation
,
and
in
a
word
,
all
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
Amazing
creatures
they
were
in
Louisa
's
eyes
,
so
white
and
pink
of
complexion
,
so
scant
of
dress
,
and
so
demonstrative
of
leg
;
but
it
was
very
agreeable
to
see
them
crowding
about
Sissy
,
and
very
natural
in
Sissy
to
be
unable
to
refrain
from
tears
.

As

in

Louisa
uttered
an
exclamation
,
partly
of
distress
,
partly
of
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
"

"
   
<EOS>
Louisa
,
with
many
thanks
and
with
a
lightened
load
,
detained
Mr
Sleary
no
longer
then
.
 
<EOS>
She
left
her
love
for
her
brother
,
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
;
and
she
and
Sissy
went
away
until
later
in
the
afternoon
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
arrived
within
an
hour
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
He
too
had
encountered
no
one
whom
he
knew
;
and
was
now
sanguine
with
Sleary
's
assistance
,
of
getting
his
disgraced
son
to
Liverpool
in
the
night
.
<EOS>
As
neither
of
the
three
could
be
his
companion
without
almost
identifying
him
under
any
disguise
,
he
prepared
a
letter
to
a
correspondent
whom
he
could
trust
,
beseeching
him
to
ship
the
bearer
off
at
any
cost
,
to
North
or
South
America
,
or
any
distant
part
of
the
world
to
which
he
could
be
the
most
speedily
and
privately
dispatched
.
   
<EOS>
This
done
,
they
walked
about
,
waiting
for
the
Circus
to
be
quite
vacated
;
not
only
by
the
audience
,
but
by
the
company
and
by
the
horses
.
 
<EOS>
After
watching
it
a
long
time
,
they
saw
Mr
Sleary
bring
out
a
chair
and
sit
down
by
the
side
-
door
,
smoking
;
as
if
that
were
his
signal
that
they
might
approach
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your
thervant
,
Thquire
,
"
was
his
cautious
salutation
as
they
passed
in
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
want

you
'll
find
me
here

<EOS>
You
<EOS>
muthn't
mind

comic
livery

"
   
<EOS>
They
all
three
went
in
;
and
Mr
Gradgrind
sat
down
forlorn
,
on
the
Clown
's
performing
chair
in
the
middle
of
the
ring
.
 
<EOS>
On
one
of
the
back
benches
,
remote
in
the
subdued
light
and
the
strangeness
of
the
place
,
sat
the
villainous
whelp
,
sulky
to
the
last
,
whom
he
had
the
misery
to
call
his
son
.
   
<EOS>
In
a
preposterous
coat
,
like
a
beadle
's
,
with
cuffs
and
flaps
exaggerated
to
an
unspeakable
extent
;
in
an
immense
waistcoat
,
knee
-
breeches
,
buckled
shoes
,
and
a
mad
cocked
hat
;
with
nothing
fitting
him
,
and
everything
of
coarse
material
,
moth
-
eaten
and
full
of
holes
;
with
seams
in
his
black
face
,
where
fear
and
heat
had
started
through
the
greasy
composition
daubed
all
over
it
;
anything
so
grimly
,
detestably
,
ridiculously
shameful
as
the
whelp
in
his
comic
livery
,
Mr
Gradgrind
never
could
by
any
other
means
have
believed
in
,
weighable
and
measurable
fact
though
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
And
one
of
his
model
children
had
come
to
this
!
   
<EOS>
At
first
the
whelp
would
not
draw
any
nearer
,
but
persisted
in
remaining
up
there
by
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Yielding
at
length
,
if
any
concession
so
sullenly
made
can
be
called
yielding
,
to
the
entreaties
of
Sissy
---
for
Louisa
he
disowned
altogether
---
he
came
down
,
bench
by
bench
,
until
he
stood
in
the
sawdust
,
on
the
verge
of
the
circle
,
as
far
as
possible
,
within
its
limits
from
where
his
father
sat
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
was
this
done
?
"
asked
the
father
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
was
what
done
?
"
<EOS>
moodily
answered
the
son
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
robbery
,
"
said
the
father
,
raising
his
voice
upon
the
word
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
forced
the
safe
myself
over
night
,
and
shut
it
up
ajar
before
I
went
away
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
had
the
key
that
was
found
,
made
long
before
.
 
<EOS>
I
dropped
it
that
morning
,
that
it
might
be
supposed
to

to
put
my

away
every
night

but
I
did
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Now
you

all
about
it

"
   
<EOS>
"
If
a
thunderbolt
had
fallen
on
me
,
"
said
the
father
,
"
it
would
have
shocked
me
less
than
this
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
why
,
"
grumbled
the
son
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
many
people
are
employed
in
situations
of
trust
;
so
many
people
,
out
of
so
many
,
will
be
dishonest
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
heard
you
talk
,
a
hundred
times
,
of
its
being
a
law
.
 
<EOS>
How
can
I
help
laws
?
 
<EOS>
You

comforted
others
with
such
things
,
father

<EOS>
Comfort
yourself
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
father
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
,
and
the
son
stood
in
his
disgraceful
grotesqueness
,
biting
straw
:
 
his
hands
,
with
the
black
partly
worn
away
inside
,
looking
like
the
hands
of
a
monkey
.
 
<EOS>
The
evening
was
fast
closing
in
;
and
from
time
to
time
,
he
turned
the
whites
of
his
eyes
restlessly
and
impatiently
towards
his
father
.
<EOS>
They
were
the
only
parts
of
his
face
that
showed
any
life
or
expression
,
the
pigment
upon
it
was
so
thick
.
   
<EOS>
"
You

be
got

sent
abroad

<EOS>
"
I

whimpered
the
whelp
,

I
have
been

<EOS>
That

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
went
to
the
door
,
and
returned
with
Sleary
,
to
whom
he
submitted
the
question
,
How
to

this
deplorable
object
away

groaned
Mr

.
 
<EOS>
"

Mr
Gradgrind
rapidly
assented
;
Mr
Sleary
rapidly
turned
out
from
a
box
,
a
smock
frock
,
a
felt
hat
,
and
other
essentials
;
the
whelp
rapidly
changed
clothes
behind
a
screen
of
baize
;
Mr
Sleary
rapidly
brought
beer
,
and
washed
him
white
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now

said
Sleary
,
"

With
which
he
delicately
retired
.
   
<EOS>
"
Here

said
Mr

<EOS>
"
All

Atone

<EOS>
The
culprit
was
moved
to
a
few
abject
tears
by
these
words
and
their
pathetic
tone
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
when
Louisa
opened
her
arms
,
he
repulsed
her
afresh
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not

returned

obdurately

Leaving

said
Sleary
,
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
They
all
confusedly
went
out
:
 
Louisa
crying
to
him
that
she
forgave
him
,
and
loved
him
still
,
and
that
he
would
one
day
be
sorry
to
have
left
her
so
,
and
glad
to
think
of
these
her
last
words
,
far
away
:
 
when
some
one
ran
against
them
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
and
Sissy
,
who
were
both
before
him
while
his
sister
yet
clung
to
his
shoulder
,
stopped
and
recoiled
.
   
<EOS>
For
,
there
was
Bitzer
,
out
of
breath
,
his
thin
lips
parted
,
his
thin
nostrils
distended
,
his
white
eyelashes
quivering
,
his
colourless
face
more
colourless
than
ever
,
as
if
he
ran
himself
into
a
white
heat
,
when
other
people
ran
themselves
into
a
glow
.
<EOS>
There
he
stood
,
panting
and
heaving
,
as
if
he
had
never
stopped
since
the
night
,
now
long
ago
,
when
he
had
run
them
down
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sorry
to
interfere
with
your
plans

"
said
Bitzer
,
shaking
his
head
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
ca
n't
allow
myself
to
be
done

<EOS>
I

I

have
him

<EOS>
By
the
collar

too
,
it
seemed

For

so
he
took
possession

him

<EOS>
They
went
back
into
the
booth
,
Sleary
shutting
the
door
to
keep
intruders
out
.
 
<EOS>
Bitzer
,
still
holding
the
paralysed
culprit
by
the
collar
,
stood
in
the
Ring
,
blinking
at
his
old
patron
through
the
darkness
of
the
twilight
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bitzer
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
broken
down
,
and
miserably
submissive
to
him
,
"
have
you

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The

returned
Bitzer
,
smiling
at
the
oddity
of
the
question
,
"

be
carried
on
without

<EOS>
No
man
,
sir
,
acquainted
with
the
facts
established
by
Harvey
relating
to
the
circulation
of
the
blood
,
can
doubt
that
I
have
a
heart

"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
accessible
,
"
cried
Mr
Gradgrind
,
"
to
any
compassionate
influence
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
accessible
to
Reason
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
excellent
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
to
nothing
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
stood
looking
at
each
other
;
Mr
Gradgrind
's
face
as
white
as
the
pursuer
's
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
motive
---
even
what
motive
in
reason
---
can
you
have
for
preventing
the
escape
of
this
wretched
youth
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
"
and
crushing
his
miserable
father
?
 
<EOS>
See
his
sister
here
.
 
<EOS>
Pity
us

"
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
returned
Bitzer
,
in
a
very
business
-
like
and
logical
manner
,
"
since
you
ask
me
what
motive
I
have
in
reason
,
for
taking
young
Mr
Tom
back
to
Coketown
,
it
is
only
reasonable
to
let
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
suspected
young
Mr
Tom
of
this
bank
-
robbery
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
I
had
had
my
eye
upon
him
before
that
time
,
for
I
knew
his
ways
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
kept
my
observations
to
myself
,
but
I
have
made
them
;
and
I
have
got
ample
proofs
against
him
now
,
besides
his
running
away
,
and
besides
his
own
confession
,
which
I
was
just
in
time
to
overhear
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
the
pleasure
of
watching
your
house
yesterday
morning
,
and
following
you
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
take
young
Mr
Tom
back
to
Coketown
,
in
order
to
deliver
him
over
to
Mr
Bounderby
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
have
no
doubt
whatever
that
Mr
Bounderby
will
then
promote
me
to
young
Mr
Tom
's
situation
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
wish
to
have
his
situation
,
sir
,
for
it
will
be
a
rise
to
me
,
and
will
do
me
good
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
this
is
solely
a
question
of
self
-
interest
with
you
---
"
Mr
Gradgrind
began
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
for
interrupting
you
,
sir
,
"
returned
Bitzer
;
"
but
I
am
sure
you
know
that
the
whole
social
system
is
a
question
of
self
-
interest
.
 
<EOS>
What
you
must
always
appeal
to
,
is
a
person
's
self
-
interest
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
your
only
hold
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
so
constituted
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
brought
up
in
that
catechism
when
I
was
very
young
,
sir
,
as
you
are
aware
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
sum
of
money
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
"
will
you
set
against
your
expected
promotion
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
,
"
returned
Bitzer
,
"
for
hinting
at
the
proposal
;
but
I
will
not
set
any
sum
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
Knowing
that
your
clear
head
would
propose
that
alternative
,
I
have
gone
over
the
calculations
in
my
mind
;
and
I
find
that
to
compound
a
felony
,
even
on
very
high
terms
indeed
,
would
not
be
as
safe
and
good
for
me
as
my
improved
prospects
in
the
Bank
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Bitzer
,
"
said
Mr
Gradgrind
,
stretching
out
his
hands
as
though
he
would
have
said
,
See
how
miserable
I
am
!
 
<EOS>
"
Bitzer
,
I
have
but
one
chance
left
to
soften
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
many
years
at
my
school
.
 
<EOS>
If
,
in
remembrance
of
the
pains
bestowed
upon
you
there
,
you
can
persuade
yourself
in
any
degree
to
disregard
your
present
interest
and
release
my
son
,
I
entreat
and
pray
you
to
give
him
the
benefit
of
that
remembrance
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
really
wonder
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
the
old
pupil
in
an
argumentative
manner
,
"
to
find
you
taking
a
position
so
untenable
.
 
<EOS>
My
schooling
was
paid
for
;
it
was
a
bargain
;
and
when
I
came
away
,
the
bargain
ended
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
a
fundamental
principle
of
the
Gradgrind
philosophy
that
everything
was
to
be
paid
for
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
was
ever
on
any
account
to
give
anybody
anything
,
or
render
anybody
help
without
purchase
.
<EOS>
Gratitude
was
to
be
abolished
,
and
the
virtues
springing
from
it
were
not
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
Every
inch
of
the
existence
of
mankind
,
from
birth
to
death
,
was
to
be
a
bargain
across
a
counter
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
we
did
n't
get
to
Heaven
that
way
,
it
was
not
a
politico
-
economical
place
,
and
we
had
no
business
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
deny
,
"
added
Bitzer
,
"
that
my
schooling
was
cheap
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
comes
right
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
made
in
the
cheapest
market
,
and
have
to
dispose
of
myself
in
the
dearest
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
a
little
troubled
here
,
by
Louisa
and
Sissy
crying
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
do
that
,
"
said
he
,
<EOS>
"
it
's
of
no
use
doing
that
:
 
<EOS>
it
only
worries

<EOS>
You
seem
to
think
that
I
have
some
animosity
against
young
Mr
Tom
;
whereas
I
have
none
at
all

<EOS>
I
am
only
going

on
the
reasonable
grounds
I
have
mentioned
,
to
take
him
back
to
Coketown

<EOS>
If
he
was
to
resist
,
I
should
set
up
the
cry
of
Stop
thief

he
wo
n't

you
may
depend

it

with

as
immovably
jammed

followed
this
desertion
of
them
by
their
last
friend

<EOS>
But
,
Sissy
glanced
at
him
with
great
attention
;
nor
did
she
in
her
own
breast
misunderstand
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
were
all
going
out
again
,
he
favoured
her
with
one
slight
roll
of
his
movable
eye
,
desiring
her
to
linger
behind
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
locked
the
door
,
he
said
excitedly
:
   
"
<EOS>

not

Tell

<EOS>

Tharp'th
the

"
   
<EOS>
The
word
was
so
sharp
,
that
in
ten
minutes
Mr
Childers
,
sauntering
about
the
market
-
place
in
a
pair
of
slippers
,
had
his
cue
,
and
Mr
Sleary
's
equipage
was
ready
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
fine
sight
,
to
behold
the
learned
dog
barking
round
it
,
and
Mr
Sleary
instructing
him
,
with
his
one
practicable
eye
,
that
Bitzer
was
the
object
of
his
particular
attentions
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
dark
they
all
three
got
in
and
started
;
the
learned
dog
(
a
formidable
creature
)
already
pinning
Bitzer
with
his
eye
,
and
sticking
close
to
the
wheel
on
his
side
,
that
he
might
be
ready
for
him
in
the
event
of
his
showing
the
slightest
disposition
to
alight
.
   
<EOS>
The
other
three
sat
up
at
the
inn
all
night
in
great
suspense
.
 
<EOS>
At
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
Mr
Sleary
and
the
dog
reappeared
:
both
in
high
spirits
.
   
<EOS>
"
All

said
Mr
Sleary
,
"

Childerth
took

<EOS>
Mr
Gradgrind
overwhelmed
him
with
thanks
,
of
course
;
and
hinted
as
delicately
as
he
could
,
at
a
handsome
remuneration
in
money
.
   
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
He
had
already
called
for
a

now
called
for
another

"

<EOS>
All
these
little
tokens
of
his
gratitude
,
Mr
Gradgrind
very
willingly
undertook
to
render
.
 
<EOS>
Though
he
thought
them
far
too
slight

he
said
,
for
such
a
service

Louisa

withdrew
into
an
adjoining
room
;
Mr
Sleary
,
stirring
and
drinking
his
brandy

water
as
he
stood

went

Mr

seemed
to
be
quite
confounded
by
this
speculation

<EOS>
"

Any

Mr

Mr

emptied

<EOS>
Final
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
dangerous
thing
to
see
anything
in
the
sphere
of
a
vain
blusterer
,
before
the
vain
blusterer
sees
it
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
felt
that
Mrs
Sparsit
had
audaciously
anticipated
him
,
and
presumed
to
be
wiser
than
he
.
 
<EOS>
Inappeasably
indignant
with
her
for
her
triumphant
discovery
of
Mrs
Pegler
,
he
turned
this
presumption
,
on
the
part
of
a
woman
in
her
dependent
position
,
over
and
over
in
his
mind
,
until
it
accumulated
with
turning
like
a
great
snowball
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
he
made
the
discovery
that
to
discharge
this
highly
connected
female
---
to
have
it
in
his
power
to
say
,
"
She
was
a
woman
of
family
,
and
wanted
to
stick
to
me
,
but
I
would
n't
have
it
,
and
got
rid
of
her
"
---
would
be
to
get
the
utmost
possible
amount
of
crowning
glory
out
of
the
connection
,
and
at
the
same
time
to
punish
Mrs
Sparsit
according
to
her
deserts
.
   
<EOS>
Filled
fuller
than
ever
,
with
this
great
idea
,
Mr
Bounderby
came
in
to
lunch
,
and
sat
himself
down
in
the
dining
-
room
of
former
days
,
where
his
portrait
was
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
sat
by
the
fire
,
with
her
foot
in
her
cotton
stirrup
,
little
thinking
whither
she
was
posting
.
   
<EOS>
Since
the
Pegler
affair
,
this
gentlewoman
had
covered
her
pity
for
Mr
Bounderby
with
a
veil
of
quiet
melancholy
and
contrition
.
 
<EOS>
In
virtue
thereof
,
it
had
become
her
habit
to
assume
a
woful
look
,
which
woful
look
she
now
bestowed
upon
her
patron
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
now
,
ma'am
?
"
said
Mr
Bounderby
,
in
a
very
short
,
rough
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
do
not
bite
my
nose
off
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bite
your
nose
off
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
repeated
Mr
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
nose
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
meaning
,
as
Mrs
Sparsit
conceived
,
that
it
was
too
developed
a
nose
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
After
which
offensive
implication
,
he
cut
himself
a
crust
of
bread
,
and
threw
the
knife
down
with
a
noise
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
took
her
foot
out
of
her
stirrup
,
and
said
,
"
Mr
Bounderby
,
sir
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
retorted
Mr
Bounderby
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
staring
at
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
,
sir

"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
"
have
you
been
ruffled
this
morning

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes

ma'am

"
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
inquire
,
sir
,
"
pursued
the
injured
woman
,
"
whether
I
am
the
unfortunate
cause
of
your
having
lost
your
temper
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
"
I
am
not
come
here
to
be
bullied
.
 
<EOS>
A
female
may
be
highly
connected
,
but
she
ca
n't
be
permitted
to
bother
and
badger
a
man
in
my
position
,
and
I
am
not
going
to
put
up
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
Mr
Bounderby
felt
it
necessary
to
get
on
:
 
<EOS>
foreseeing
that
if
he
allowed
of
details
,
he
would
be
beaten
.
)
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
first
elevated
,
then
knitted
,
her
Coriolanian
eyebrows
;
gathered
up
her
work
into
its
proper
basket
;
and
rose
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
she
,
majestically
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
apparent
to
me
that
I
am
in
your
way
at
present
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
retire
to
my
own
apartment
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Allow
me
to
open
the
door
,
ma'am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
;
I
can
do
it
for
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
allow
me
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
passing
her
,
and
getting
his
hand
upon
the
lock
;
"
because
I
can
take
the
opportunity
of
saying
a
word
to
you
,
before
you
go
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
,
ma'am
,
I
rather
think
you
are
cramped
here
,
do
you
know
?
 
<EOS>
It
appears
to
me
,
that
,
under
my
humble
roof
,
there
's
hardly
opening
enough
for
a
lady
of
your
genius
in
other
people
's
affairs
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Sparsit
gave
him
a
look
of
the
darkest
scorn
,
and
said
with
great
politeness
,
"
Really
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
thinking
it
over
,
you
see
,
since
the
late
affairs
have
happened
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Bounderby
;
"
and
it
appears
to
my
poor
judgment
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
Mrs
Sparsit
interposed
,
with
sprightly
cheerfulness
,
"
do
n't
disparage
your
judgment
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
knows
how
unerring
Mr
Bounderby
's
judgment
is
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
has
had
proofs
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
the
theme
of
general
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
Disparage
anything
in
yourself
but
your
judgment
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Sparsit
,
laughing
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
,
very
red
and
uncomfortable
,
resumed
:
   
"
<EOS>
It
appears
to
me
,
ma'am
,
I
say
,
that
a
different
sort
of
establishment
altogether
would
bring
out
a
lady
of
your
powers
.
<EOS>
Such
an
establishment
as
your
relation
,
Lady
Scadgers
's
,
now
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
you
might
find
some
affairs
there
,
ma'am
,
to
interfere
with
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
never
occurred
to
me
before
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
;
"
but
now
you
mention
it
,
should
think
it
highly
probable
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
suppose
you
try
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Bounderby
,
laying
an
envelope
with
a
cheque
in
it
in
her
little
basket
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
can
take
your
own
time
for
going
,
ma'am
;
but
perhaps
in
the
meanwhile
,
it
will
be
more
agreeable
to
a
lady
of
your
powers
of
mind
,
to
eat
her
meals
by
herself
,
and
not
to
be
intruded
upon
.
 
<EOS>
I
really
ought
to
apologise
to
you
---
being
only
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
---
for
having
stood
in
your
light
so
long
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
name
it
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Sparsit
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
that
portrait
could
speak
,
sir
---
but
it
has
the
advantage
over
the
original
of
not
possessing
the
power
of
committing
itself
and
disgusting
others
,
---
it
would
testify
,
that
a
long
period
has
elapsed
since
I
first
habitually
addressed
it
as
the
picture
of
a
Noodle
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
that
a
Noodle
does
,
can
awaken
surprise
or
indignation
;
the
proceedings
of
a
Noodle
can
only
inspire
contempt
.
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
saying
,
Mrs
Sparsit
,
with
her
Roman
features
like
a
medal
struck
to
commemorate
her
scorn
of
Mr
Bounderby
,
surveyed
him
fixedly
from
head
to
foot
,
swept
disdainfully
past
him
,
and
ascended
the
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bounderby
closed
the
door
,
and
stood
before
the
fire
;
projecting
himself
after
his
old
explosive
manner
into
his
portrait
---
and
into
futurity
.
   
<EOS>
Into
how
much
of
futurity
?
 
<EOS>
He
saw
Mrs
Sparsit
fighting
out
a
daily
fight
at
the
points
of
all
the
weapons
in
the
female
armoury
,
with
the
grudging
,
smarting
,
peevish
,
tormenting
Lady
Scadgers
,
still
laid
up
in
bed
with
her
mysterious
leg
,
and
gobbling
her
insufficient
income
down
by
about
the
middle
of
every
quarter
,
in
a
mean
little
airless
lodging
,
a
mere
closet
for
one
,
a
mere
crib
for
two
;
but
did
he
see
more
?
 
<EOS>
Did
he
catch
any
glimpse
of
himself
making
a
show
of
Bitzer
to
strangers
,
as
the
rising
young
man
,
so
devoted
to
his
master
's
great
merits
,
who
had
won
young
Tom
's
place
,
and
had
almost
captured
young
Tom
himself
,
in
the
times
when
by
various
rascals
he
was
spirited
away
?
 
<EOS>
Did
he
see
any
faint
reflection
of
his
own
image
making
a
vain
-
glorious
will
,
whereby
five
-
and
-
twenty
Humbugs
,
past
five
-
and
-
fifty
years
of
age
,
each
taking
upon
himself
the
name
,
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
,
should
for
ever
dine
in
Bounderby
Hall
,
for
ever
lodge
in
Bounderby
buildings
,
for
ever
attend
a
Bounderby
chapel
,
for
ever
go
to
sleep
under
a
Bounderby
chaplain
,
for
ever
be
supported
out
of
a
Bounderby
estate
,
and
for
ever
nauseate
all
healthy
stomachs
,
with
a
vast
amount
of
Bounderby
balderdash
and
bluster
?
 
<EOS>
Had
he
any
prescience
of
the
day
,
five
years
to
come
,
when
Josiah
Bounderby
of
Coketown
was
to
die
of
a
fit
in
the
Coketown
street
,
and
this
same
precious
will
was
to
begin
its
long
career
of
quibble
,
plunder
,
false
pretences
,
vile
example
,
little
service
and
much
law
?
<EOS>
Probably
not
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
the
portrait
was
to
see
it
all
out
.
   
<EOS>
Here
was
Mr
Gradgrind
on
the
same
day
,
and
in
the
same
hour
,
sitting
thoughtful
in
his
own
room
.
 
<EOS>
How
much
of
futurity
did
he
see
?
 
<EOS>
Did
he
see
himself
,
a
white
-
haired
decrepit
man
,
bending
his
hitherto
inflexible
theories
to
appointed
circumstances
;
making
his
facts
and
figures
subservient
to
Faith
,
Hope
,
and
Charity
;
and
no
longer
trying
to
grind
that
Heavenly
trio
in
his
dusty
little
mills
?
 
<EOS>
Did
he
catch
sight
of
himself
,
therefore
much
despised
by
his
late
political
associates
?
 
<EOS>
Did
he
see
them
,
in
the
era
of
its
being
quite
settled
that
the
national
dustmen
have
only
to
do
with
one
another
,
and
owe
no
duty
to
an
abstraction
called
a
People
,
"
taunting
the
honourable
gentleman
"
with
this
and
with
that
and
with
what
not
,
five
nights
a
-
week
,
until
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
?
 
<EOS>
Probably
he
had
that
much
foreknowledge
,
knowing
his
men
.
   
<EOS>
Here
was
Louisa
on
the
night
of
the
same
day
,
watching
the
fire
as
in
days
of
yore
,
though
with
a
gentler
and
a
humbler
face
.
 
<EOS>
How
much
of
the
future
might
arise
before
her
vision
?
 
<EOS>
Broadsides
in
the
streets
,
signed
with
her
father
's
name
,
exonerating
the
late
Stephen
Blackpool
,
weaver
,
from
misplaced
suspicion
,
and
publishing
the
guilt
of
his
own
son
,
with
such
extenuation
as
his
years
and
temptation
<EOS>
(
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
add
,
his
education
)
might
beseech
;
were
of
the
Present
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
Stephen
Blackpool
's
tombstone
,
with
her
father
's
record
of
his
death
,
was
almost
of
the
Present
,
for
she
knew
it
was
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
These
things
she
could
plainly
see
.
<EOS>
But
,
how
much
of
the
Future
?
   
<EOS>
A
working
woman
,
christened
Rachael
,
after
a
long
illness
once
again
appearing
at
the
ringing
of
the
Factory
bell
,
and
passing
to
and
fro
at
the
set
hours
,
among
the
Coketown
Hands
;
a
woman
of
pensive
beauty
,
always
dressed
in
black
,
but
sweet
-
tempered
and
serene
,
and
even
cheerful
;
who
,
of
all
the
people
in
the
place
,
alone
appeared
to
have
compassion
on
a
degraded
,
drunken
wretch
of
her
own
sex
,
who
was
sometimes
seen
in
the
town
secretly
begging
of
her
,
and
crying
to
her
;
a
woman
working
,
ever
working
,
but
content
to
do
it
,
and
preferring
to
do
it
as
her
natural
lot
,
until
she
should
be
too
old
to
labour
any
more
?
 
<EOS>
Did
Louisa
see
this
?
 
<EOS>
Such
a
thing
was
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
A
lonely
brother
,
many
thousands
of
miles
away
,
writing
,
on
paper
blotted
with
tears
,
that
her
words
had
too
soon
come
true
,
and
that
all
the
treasures
in
the
world
would
be
cheaply
bartered
for
a
sight
of
her
dear
face
?
 
<EOS>
At
length
this
brother
coming
nearer
home
,
with
hope
of
seeing
her
,
and
being
delayed
by
illness
;
and
then
a
letter
,
in
a
strange
hand
,
saying
"
he
died
in
hospital
,
of
fever
,
such
a
day
,
and
died
in
penitence
and
love
of
you
:
 
his
last
word
being
your
name
"
?
 
<EOS>
Did
Louisa
see
these
things
?
 
<EOS>
Such
things
were
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
Herself
again
a
wife
---
a
mother
---
lovingly
watchful
of
her
children
,
ever
careful
that
they
should
have
a
childhood
of
the
mind
<EOS>
no
less
than
a
childhood
of
the
body
,
as
knowing
it
to
be
even
a
more
beautiful
thing
,
and
a
possession
,
any
hoarded
scrap
of
which
,
is
a
blessing
and
happiness
to
the
wisest
?
 
<EOS>
Did
Louisa
see
this
?
 
<EOS>
Such
a
thing
was
never
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
happy
Sissy
's
happy
children
loving
her
;
all
children
loving
her
;
she
,
grown
learned
in
childish
lore
;
thinking
no
innocent
and
pretty
fancy
ever
to
be
despised
;
trying
hard
to
know
her
humbler
fellow
-
creatures
,
and
to
beautify
their
lives
of
machinery
and
reality
with
those
imaginative
graces
and
delights
,
without
which
the
heart
of
infancy
will
wither
up
,
the
sturdiest
physical
manhood
will
be
morally
stark
death
,
and
the
plainest
national
prosperity
figures
can
show
,
will
be
the
Writing
on
the
Wall
,
---
she
holding
this
course
as
part
of
no
fantastic
vow
,
or
bond
,
or
brotherhood
,
or
sisterhood
,
or
pledge
,
or
covenant
,
or
fancy
dress
,
or
fancy
fair
;
but
simply
as
a
duty
to
be
done
,
---
did
Louisa
see
these
things
of
herself
?
 
<EOS>
These
things
were
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
Dear
reader
!
 
<EOS>
It
rests
with
you
and
me
,
whether
,
in
our
two
fields
of
action
,
similar
things
shall
be
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
Let
them
be
!
 
<EOS>
We
shall
sit
with
lighter
bosoms
on
the
hearth
,
to
see
the
ashes
of
our
fires
turn
gray
and
cold
.
