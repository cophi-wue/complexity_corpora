 
OUR
SOCIETY
 
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
Cranford
is
in
possession
of
the
Amazons
;
all
the
holders
of
houses
above
a
certain
rent
are
women
.
 
<EOS>
If
a
married
couple
come
to
settle
in
the
town
,
somehow
the
gentleman
disappears
;
he
is
either
fairly
frightened
to
death
by
being
the
only
man
in
the
Cranford
evening
parties
,
or
he
is
accounted
for
by
being
with
his
regiment
,
his
ship
,
or
closely
engaged
in
business
all
the
week
in
the
great
neighbouring
commercial
town
of
Drumble
,
distant
only
twenty
miles
on
a
railroad
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
whatever
does
become
of
the
gentlemen
,
they
are
not
at
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
What
could
they
do
if
they
were
there
?
 
<EOS>
The
surgeon
has
his
round
of
thirty
miles
,
and
sleeps
at
Cranford
;
but
every
man
can
not
be
a
surgeon
.
 
<EOS>
For
keeping
the
trim
gardens
full
of
choice
flowers
without
a
weed
to
speck
them
;
for
frightening
away
little
boys
who
look
wistfully
at
the
said
flowers
through
the
railings
;
for
rushing
out
at
the
geese
that
occasionally
venture
in
to
the
gardens
if
the
gates
are
left
open
;
for
deciding
all
questions
of
literature
and
politics
without
troubling
themselves
with
unnecessary
reasons
or
arguments
;
for
obtaining
clear
and
correct
knowledge
of
everybody
's
affairs
in
the
parish
;
for
keeping
their
neat
maid
-
servants
in
admirable
order
;
for
kindness
(
somewhat
dictatorial
)
to
the
poor
,
and
real
tender
good
offices
to
each
other
whenever
they
are
in
distress
,
the
ladies
of
Cranford
are
quite
sufficient
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
man
,
"
as
one
of
them
observed
to
me
once
,
"
is
SO
in
the
way
in
the
house
!
"
 
<EOS>
Although
the
ladies
of
Cranford
know
all
each
other
's
proceedings
,
they
are
exceedingly
indifferent
to
each
other
's
opinions
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
as
each
has
her
own
individuality
,
not
to
say
eccentricity
,
pretty
strongly
developed
,
nothing
is
so
easy
as
verbal
retaliation
;
but
,
somehow
,
good
-
will
reigns
among
them
to
a
considerable
degree
.
  
<EOS>
The
Cranford
ladies
have
only
an
occasional
little
quarrel
,
spirited
out
in
a
few
peppery
words
and
angry
jerks
of
the
head
;
just
enough
to
prevent
the
even
tenor
of
their
lives
from
becoming
too
flat
.
 
<EOS>
Their
dress
is
very
independent
of
fashion
;
as
they
observe
,
"
What
does
it
signify
how
we
dress
here
at
Cranford
,
where
everybody
knows
us
?
"
 
<EOS>
And
if
they
go
from
home
,
their
reason
is
equally
cogent
,
"
What
does
it
signify
how
we
dress
here
,
where
nobody
knows
us
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
materials
of
their
clothes
are
,
in
general
,
good
and
plain
,
and
most
of
them
are
nearly
as
scrupulous
as
Miss
Tyler
,
of
cleanly
memory
;
but
I
will
answer
for
it
,
the
last
gigot
,
the
last
tight
and
scanty
petticoat
in
wear
in
England
,
was
seen
in
Cranford
 
and
seen
without
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
testify
to
a
magnificent
family
red
silk
umbrella
,
under
which
a
gentle
little
spinster
,
left
alone
of
many
brothers
and
sisters
,
used
to
patter
to
church
on
rainy
days
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
any
red
silk
umbrellas
in
London
?
 
<EOS>
We
had
a
tradition
of
the
first
that
had
ever
been
seen
in
Cranford
;
and
the
little
boys
mobbed
it
,
and
called
it
"
a
stick
in
petticoats
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
the
very
red
silk
one
I
have
described
,
held
by
a
strong
father
over
a
troop
of
little
ones
;
the
poor
little
lady
 
<EOS>
the
survivor
of
all
 
could
scarcely
carry
it
.
  
<EOS>
Then
there
were
rules
and
regulations
for
visiting
and
calls
;
and
they
were
announced
to
any
young
people
who
might
be
staying
in
the
town
,
with
all
the
solemnity
with
which
the
old
Manx
laws
were
read
once
a
year
on
the
Tinwald
Mount
.
  
<EOS>
"
Our
friends
have
sent
to
inquire
how
you
are
after
your
journey
to
-
night
,
my
dear
"
(
fifteen
miles
in
a
gentleman
's
carriage
)
;
"
they
will
give
you
some
rest
to
-
morrow
,
but
the
next
day
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
they
will
call
;
so
be
at
liberty
after
twelve
 
from
twelve
to
three
<EOS>
are
our
calling
hours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
,
after
they
had
called
     
"
It
is
the
third
day
;
I
dare
say
your
mamma
has
told
you
,
my
dear
,
never
to
let
more
than
three
days
elapse
between
receiving
a
call
and
returning
it
;
and
also
,
that
you
are
never
to
stay
longer
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
"
  
"
But
am
I
to
look
at
my
watch
?
 
<EOS>
How
am
I
to
find
out
when
a
quarter
of
an
hour
has
passed
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
keep
thinking
about
the
time
,
my
dear
,
and
not
allow
yourself
to
forget
it
in
conversation
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
everybody
had
this
rule
in
their
minds
,
whether
they
received
or
paid
a
call
,
of
course
no
absorbing
subject
was
ever
spoken
about
.
<EOS>
We
kept
ourselves
to
short
sentences
of
small
talk
,
and
were
punctual
to
our
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
imagine
that
a
few
of
the
gentlefolks
of
Cranford
were
poor
,
and
had
some
difficulty
in
making
both
ends
meet
;
but
they
were
like
the
Spartans
,
and
concealed
their
smart
under
a
smiling
face
.
 
<EOS>
We
none
of
us
spoke
of
money
,
because
that
subject
savoured
of
commerce
and
trade
,
and
though
some
might
be
poor
,
we
were
all
aristocratic
.
 
<EOS>
The
Cranfordians
had
that
kindly
esprit
de
corps
which
made
them
overlook
all
deficiencies
in
success
when
some
among
them
tried
to
conceal
their
poverty
.
 
<EOS>
When
Mrs
Forrester
,
for
instance
,
gave
a
party
in
her
baby
-
house
of
a
dwelling
,
and
the
little
maiden
disturbed
the
ladies
on
the
sofa
by
a
request
that
she
might
get
the
tea
-
tray
out
from
underneath
<EOS>
,
everyone
took
this
novel
proceeding
as
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
,
and
talked
on
about
household
forms
and
ceremonies
as
if
we
all
believed
that
our
hostess
had
a
regular
servants
'
hall
,
second
table
,
with
housekeeper
and
steward
,
instead
of
the
one
little
charity
-
school
maiden
,
whose
short
ruddy
arms
could
never
have
been
strong
enough
to
carry
the
tray
upstairs
,
if
she
had
not
been
assisted
in
private
by
her
mistress
,
who
now
sat
in
state
,
pretending
not
to
know
what
cakes
were
sent
up
,
though
she
knew
,
and
we
knew
,
and
she
knew
that
we
knew
,
and
we
knew
that
she
knew
that
we
knew
,
she
had
been
busy
all
the
morning
making
tea
-
bread
and
sponge
-
cakes
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
one
or
two
consequences
arising
from
this
general
but
unacknowledged
poverty
,
and
this
very
much
acknowledged
gentility
,
which
were
not
amiss
,
and
which
might
be
introduced
into
many
circles
of
society
to
their
great
improvement
.
 
<EOS>
For
instance
,
the
inhabitants
of
Cranford
kept
early
hours
,
and
clattered
home
in
their
pattens
,
under
the
guidance
of
a
lantern
-
bearer
,
about
nine
o'clock
at
night
;
and
the
whole
town
was
abed
and
asleep
by
half
-
past
ten
.
 
<EOS>
Moreover
,
it
was
considered
"
vulgar
"
(
a
tremendous
word
in
Cranford
)
to
give
anything
expensive
,
in
the
way
of
eatable
or
drinkable
,
at
the
evening
entertainments
.
 
<EOS>
Wafer
bread
-
and
-
butter
and
sponge
-
biscuits
were
all
that
the
Honourable
Mrs
Jamieson
gave
;
and
she
was
sister
-
in
-
law
to
the
late
Earl
of
Glenmire
,
although
she
did
practise
such
"
elegant
economy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Elegant
economy
!
"
 
<EOS>
How
naturally
one
falls
back
into
the
phraseology
of
Cranford
!
 
<EOS>
There
,
economy
was
always
"
elegant
,
"
and
money
-
spending
always
"
vulgar
and
ostentatious
"
;
a
sort
of
sour
-
grapeism
which
made
us
very
peaceful
and
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
shall
forget
the
dismay
felt
when
a
certain
Captain
Brown
came
to
live
at
Cranford
,
and
openly
spoke
about
his
being
poor
 
not
in
a
whisper
to
an
intimate
friend
,
the
doors
and
windows
being
previously
closed
,
but
in
the
public
street
!
<EOS>
in
a
loud
military
voice
!
<EOS>
alleging
his
poverty
as
a
reason
for
not
taking
a
particular
house
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
of
Cranford
were
already
rather
moaning
over
the
invasion
of
their
territories
by
a
man
and
a
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
half
-
pay
captain
,
and
had
obtained
some
situation
on
a
neighbouring
railroad
,
which
had
been
vehemently
petitioned
against
by
the
little
town
;
and
if
,
in
addition
to
his
masculine
gender
,
and
his
connection
with
the
obnoxious
railroad
,
he
was
so
brazen
as
to
talk
of
being
poor
 
<EOS>
why
,
then
,
indeed
,
he
must
be
sent
to
Coventry
.
<EOS>
Death
was
as
true
and
as
common
as
poverty
;
yet
people
never
spoke
about
that
,
loud
out
in
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
word
not
to
be
mentioned
to
ears
polite
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
tacitly
agreed
to
ignore
that
any
with
whom
we
associated
on
terms
of
visiting
equality
could
ever
be
prevented
by
poverty
from
doing
anything
that
they
wished
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
walked
to
or
from
a
party
,
it
was
because
the
night
was
SO
fine
,
or
the
air
SO
refreshing
,
not
because
sedan
-
chairs
were
expensive
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
wore
prints
,
instead
of
summer
silks
,
it
was
because
we
preferred
a
washing
material
;
and
so
on
,
till
we
blinded
ourselves
to
the
vulgar
fact
that
we
were
,
all
of
us
,
people
of
very
moderate
means
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
,
then
,
we
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
a
man
who
could
speak
of
poverty
as
if
it
was
not
a
disgrace
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
somehow
,
Captain
Brown
made
himself
respected
in
Cranford
,
and
was
called
upon
,
in
spite
of
all
resolutions
to
the
contrary
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
surprised
to
hear
his
opinions
quoted
as
authority
at
a
visit
which
I
paid
to
Cranford
about
a
year
after
he
had
settled
in
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
My
own
friends
had
been
among
the
bitterest
opponents
of
any
proposal
to
visit
the
Captain
and
his
daughters
,
only
twelve
months
before
;
and
now
he
was
even
admitted
in
the
tabooed
hours
before
twelve
.
 
<EOS>
True
,
it
was
to
discover
the
cause
of
a
smoking
chimney
,
before
the
fire
was
lighted
;
but
still
Captain
Brown
walked
upstairs
,
nothing
daunted
,
spoke
in
a
voice
too
large
for
the
room
,
and
joked
quite
in
the
way
of
a
tame
man
about
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
blind
to
all
the
small
slights
,
and
omissions
of
trivial
ceremonies
,
with
which
he
had
been
received
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
friendly
,
though
the
Cranford
ladies
had
been
cool
;
he
had
answered
small
sarcastic
compliments
in
good
faith
;
and
with
his
manly
frankness
had
overpowered
all
the
shrinking
which
met
him
as
a
man
who
was
not
ashamed
to
be
poor
.
<EOS>
And
,
at
last
,
his
excellent
masculine
common
sense
,
and
<EOS>
his
facility
in
devising
expedients
to
overcome
domestic
dilemmas
,
had
gained
him
an
extraordinary
place
as
authority
among
the
Cranford
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
He
himself
went
on
in
his
course
,
as
unaware
of
his
popularity
as
he
had
been
of
the
reverse
;
and
I
am
sure
he
was
startled
one
day
when
he
found
his
advice
so
highly
esteemed
as
to
make
some
counsel
which
he
had
given
in
jest
to
be
taken
in
sober
,
serious
earnest
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
on
this
subject
:
 
<EOS>
An
old
lady
had
an
Alderney
cow
,
which
she
looked
upon
as
a
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
You
could
not
pay
the
short
quarter
of
an
hour
call
without
being
told
of
the
wonderful
milk
or
wonderful
intelligence
of
this
animal
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
town
knew
and
kindly
regarded
Miss
Betsy
Barker
's
Alderney
;
therefore
great
was
the
sympathy
and
regret
when
,
in
an
unguarded
moment
,
the
poor
cow
tumbled
into
a
lime
-
pit
.
 
<EOS>
She
moaned
so
loudly
that
she
was
soon
heard
and
rescued
;
but
meanwhile
the
poor
beast
had
lost
most
of
her
hair
,
and
came
out
looking
naked
,
cold
,
and
miserable
,
in
a
bare
skin
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
pitied
the
animal
,
though
a
few
could
not
restrain
their
smiles
at
her
droll
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Betsy
Barker
absolutely
cried
with
sorrow
and
dismay
;
and
it
was
said
she
thought
of
trying
a
bath
of
oil
.
 
<EOS>
This
remedy
,
perhaps
,
was
recommended
by
some
one
of
the
number
whose
advice
she
asked
;
but
the
proposal
,
if
ever
it
was
made
,
was
knocked
on
the
head
by
Captain
Brown
's
decided
<EOS>
"
Get
her
a
flannel
waistcoat
and
flannel
drawers
,
ma'am
,
if
you
wish
to
keep
her
alive
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
advice
is
,
kill
the
poor
creature
at
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Betsy
Barker
dried
her
eyes
,
and
thanked
the
Captain
heartily
;
she
set
to
work
,
and
by
-
and
-
by
all
the
town
turned
out
to
see
the
Alderney
meekly
going
to
her
pasture
,
clad
in
dark
grey
flannel
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
watched
her
myself
many
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
ever
see
cows
dressed
in
grey
flannel
in
London
?
  
<EOS>
Captain
Brown
had
taken
a
small
house
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
,
where
he
lived
with
his
two
daughters
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
have
been
upwards
of
sixty
at
the
time
of
the
first
visit
I
paid
to
Cranford
after
I
had
left
it
as
a
residence
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
a
wiry
,
well
-
trained
,
elastic
figure
,
<EOS>
a
stiff
military
throw
-
back
of
his
head
,
and
a
springing
step
,
which
made
him
appear
much
younger
than
he
was
.
<EOS>
His
eldest
daughter
looked
almost
as
old
as
himself
,
and
betrayed
the
fact
that
his
real
was
more
than
his
apparent
age
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Brown
must
have
been
forty
;
she
had
a
sickly
,
pained
,
careworn
expression
on
her
face
,
and
looked
as
if
the
gaiety
of
youth
had
long
faded
out
of
sight
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
young
she
must
have
been
plain
and
hard
-
featured
.
<EOS>
Miss
Jessie
Brown
was
ten
years
younger
than
her
sister
,
and
twenty
shades
prettier
.
 
<EOS>
Her
face
was
round
and
dimpled
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
once
said
,
in
a
passion
against
Captain
Brown
(
the
cause
of
which
I
will
tell
you
presently
)
,
"
that
she
thought
it
was
time
for
Miss
Jessie
to
leave
off
her
dimples
,
and
not
always
to
be
trying
to
look
like
a
child
.
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
true
there
was
something
childlike
in
her
face
;
and
there
will
be
,
I
think
,
till
she
dies
,
though
she
should
live
to
a
hundred
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
large
blue
wondering
eyes
,
looking
straight
at
you
;
her
nose
was
unformed
and
snub
,
and
her
lips
were
red
and
dewy
;
she
wore
her
hair
,
too
,
in
little
rows
of
curls
,
which
heightened
this
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
she
was
pretty
or
not
;
but
I
liked
her
face
,
and
so
did
everybody
,
and
I
do
not
think
she
could
help
her
dimples
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
something
of
her
father
's
jauntiness
of
gait
and
manner
;
and
any
female
observer
might
detect
a
slight
difference
in
the
attire
of
the
two
sisters
 
that
of
Miss
Jessie
being
about
two
pounds
per
annum
more
expensive
than
Miss
Brown
's
.
 
<EOS>
Two
pounds
was
a
large
sum
in
Captain
Brown
's
annual
disbursements
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
the
impression
made
upon
me
by
the
Brown
family
when
I
first
saw
them
all
together
in
Cranford
Church
.
 
<EOS>
The
Captain
I
had
met
before
 
on
the
occasion
of
the
smoky
chimney
,
which
he
had
cured
by
some
simple
alteration
in
the
flue
.
 
<EOS>
In
church
,
he
held
his
double
eye
-
glass
to
his
eyes
during
the
Morning
Hymn
,
and
then
lifted
up
his
head
erect
and
sang
out
loud
and
joyfully
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
the
responses
louder
than
the
clerk
 
an
old
man
with
a
piping
feeble
voice
,
who
,
I
think
,
felt
aggrieved
at
the
Captain
's
sonorous
bass
,
and
quivered
higher
and
higher
in
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
On
coming
out
of
church
,
the
brisk
Captain
paid
the
most
gallant
attention
to
his
two
daughters
.
  
<EOS>
He
nodded
and
smiled
to
his
acquaintances
;
but
he
shook
hands
with
none
until
he
had
helped
Miss
Brown
to
unfurl
her
umbrella
,
had
relieved
her
of
her
prayer
-
book
,
and
had
waited
patiently
till
she
,
with
trembling
nervous
hands
,
had
taken
up
her
gown
to
walk
through
the
wet
roads
.
  
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
the
Cranford
ladies
did
with
Captain
Brown
at
their
parties
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
often
rejoiced
,
in
former
days
,
that
there
was
no
gentleman
to
be
attended
to
,
and
to
find
conversation
for
,
at
the
card
-
parties
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
congratulated
ourselves
upon
the
snugness
of
the
evenings
;
and
,
in
our
love
for
gentility
,
and
distaste
of
mankind
,
we
had
almost
persuaded
ourselves
that
to
be
a
man
was
to
be
"
vulgar
"
;
so
that
when
I
found
my
friend
and
hostess
,
Miss
Jenkyns
,
was
going
to
have
a
party
in
my
honour
,
and
that
Captain
and
the
Miss
Browns
were
invited
<EOS>
,
I
wondered
much
what
would
be
the
course
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Card
-
tables
,
with
green
baize
tops
,
were
set
out
by
daylight
,
just
as
usual
;
it
was
the
third
week
in
November
,
so
the
evenings
closed
in
about
four
.
 
<EOS>
Candles
,
and
clean
packs
of
cards
,
were
arranged
on
each
table
.
 
<EOS>
The
fire
was
made
up
;
the
neat
maid
-
servant
had
received
her
last
directions
;
and
there
we
stood
,
dressed
in
our
best
,
each
with
a
candle
-
lighter
in
our
hands
,
ready
to
dart
at
the
candles
as
soon
as
the
first
knock
came
.
 
<EOS>
Parties
in
Cranford
were
solemn
festivities
,
making
the
ladies
feel
gravely
elated
as
they
sat
together
in
their
best
dresses
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
three
had
arrived
,
we
sat
down
to
"
Preference
,
"
I
being
the
unlucky
fourth
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
four
comers
were
put
down
immediately
to
another
table
;
and
presently
the
tea
-
trays
,
which
I
had
seen
set
out
in
the
store
-
room
as
I
passed
in
the
morning
,
were
placed
each
on
the
middle
of
a
card
-
table
.
 
<EOS>
The
china
was
delicate
egg
-
shell
;
the
old
-
fashioned
silver
glittered
with
polishing
;
but
the
eatables
were
of
the
slightest
description
.
<EOS>
While
the
trays
were
yet
on
the
tables
,
Captain
and
the
Miss
Browns
came
in
;
and
I
could
see
that
,
somehow
or
other
,
the
Captain
was
a
favourite
with
all
the
ladies
present
.
 
<EOS>
Ruffled
brows
were
smoothed
,
sharp
voices
lowered
at
his
approach
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Brown
looked
ill
,
and
depressed
almost
to
gloom
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jessie
smiled
as
usual
,
and
seemed
nearly
as
popular
as
her
father
.
 
<EOS>
He
immediately
and
quietly
assumed
the
man
's
place
in
the
room
;
attended
to
every
one
's
wants
,
lessened
the
pretty
maid
-
servant
's
labour
by
waiting
on
empty
cups
and
bread
-
and
-
butterless
ladies
;
and
yet
did
it
all
in
so
easy
and
dignified
a
manner
,
and
so
much
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
course
for
the
strong
to
attend
to
the
weak
,
that
he
was
a
true
man
throughout
.
 
<EOS>
He
played
for
threepenny
points
with
as
grave
an
interest
as
if
they
had
been
pounds
;
and
yet
,
in
all
his
attention
to
strangers
,
he
had
an
eye
on
his
suffering
daughter
 
for
suffering
I
was
sure
she
was
,
though
to
many
eyes
she
might
only
appear
to
be
irritable
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jessie
could
not
play
cards
:
but
she
talked
to
the
sitters
-
out
,
who
,
before
her
coming
,
had
been
rather
inclined
to
be
cross
.
 
<EOS>
She
sang
,
too
,
to
an
old
cracked
piano
,
which
I
think
had
been
a
spinet
in
its
youth
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jessie
sang
,
"
Jock
of
Hazeldean
"
a
little
out
of
tune
;
but
we
were
none
of
us
musical
,
though
Miss
Jenkyns
beat
time
,
out
of
time
,
by
way
of
appearing
to
be
so
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
very
good
of
Miss
Jenkyns
to
do
this
;
for
I
had
seen
that
,
a
little
before
,
she
had
been
a
good
deal
annoyed
by
Miss
Jessie
Brown
's
unguarded
admission
(
a
propos
of
Shetland
wool
)
that
she
had
an
uncle
,
her
mother
's
brother
,
who
was
a
shop
-
keeper
in
Edinburgh
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
tried
to
drown
this
confession
by
a
terrible
cough
 
for
the
Honourable
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
was
sitting
at
a
card
-
table
nearest
Miss
Jessie
,
and
what
would
she
say
or
think
if
she
found
out
she
was
in
the
same
room
with
a
shop
-
keeper
's
niece
!
<EOS>
But
Miss
Jessie
Brown
(
who
had
no
tact
,
as
we
all
agreed
the
next
morning
)
WOULD
repeat
the
information
,
and
assure
Miss
Pole
she
could
easily
get
her
the
identical
Shetland
wool
required
,
"
through
my
uncle
,
who
has
the
best
assortment
of
Shetland
goods
of
any
one
in
Edinbro
'
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
to
take
the
taste
of
this
out
of
our
mouths
,
and
the
sound
of
this
out
of
our
ears
,
that
Miss
Jenkyns
proposed
music
;
so
I
say
again
,
it
was
very
good
of
her
to
beat
time
to
the
song
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
trays
re
-
appeared
with
biscuits
and
wine
,
punctually
at
a
quarter
to
nine
,
there
was
conversation
,
comparing
of
cards
,
and
talking
over
tricks
;
but
by
-
and
-
by
Captain
Brown
sported
a
bit
of
literature
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
seen
any
numbers
of
"
The
Pickwick
Papers
"
?
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
(
They
we
're
then
publishing
in
parts
.
)
 
<EOS>
"
Capital
thing
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
Miss
Jenkyns
was
daughter
of
a
deceased
rector
of
Cranford
;
and
,
on
the
strength
of
a
number
of
manuscript
sermons
,
and
a
pretty
good
library
of
divinity
,
considered
herself
literary
,
and
looked
upon
any
conversation
about
books
as
a
challenge
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
answered
and
said
,
"
Yes
,
she
had
seen
them
;
indeed
,
she
might
say
she
had
read
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
you
think
of
them
?
"
exclaimed
Captain
Brown
.
 
<EOS>
"
Are
n't
they
famously
good
?
"
  
<EOS>
So
urged
Miss
Jenkyns
could
not
but
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
say
,
I
do
n't
think
they
are
by
any
means
equal
to
Dr
Johnson
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
perhaps
,
the
author
is
young
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
persevere
,
and
who
knows
what
he
may
become
if
he
will
take
the
great
Doctor
for
his
model
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
This
was
evidently
too
much
for
Captain
Brown
to
take
placidly
;
and
I
saw
the
words
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
before
Miss
Jenkyns
had
finished
her
sentence
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
quite
a
different
sort
of
thing
,
my
dear
madam
,
"
he
began
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
aware
of
that
,
"
returned
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
make
allowances
,
Captain
Brown
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Just
allow
me
to
read
you
a
scene
out
of
this
month
's
number
,
"
pleaded
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
had
it
only
this
morning
,
and
I
do
n't
think
the
company
can
have
read
it
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
As
you
please
,
"
said
she
,
settling
herself
with
an
air
of
resignation
.
 
<EOS>
He
read
the
account
of
the
"
swarry
"
which
Sam
Weller
gave
at
Bath
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
us
laughed
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
dare
,
because
I
was
staying
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
sat
in
patient
gravity
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
was
ended
,
she
turned
to
me
,
and
said
with
mild
dignity
     
<EOS>
"
Fetch
me
"
Rasselas
,
"
my
dear
,
out
of
the
book
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
I
had
brought
it
to
her
,
she
turned
to
Captain
Brown
     
"
Now
allow
me
to
read
you
a
scene
,
and
then
the
present
company
can
judge
between
your
favourite
,
Mr
Boz
,
and
Dr
Johnson
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
read
one
of
the
conversations
between
Rasselas
and
Imlac
,
in
a
high
-
pitched
,
majestic
voice
:
 
and
when
she
had
ended
,
she
said
,
"
I
imagine
I
am
now
justified
in
my
preference
of
Dr
Johnson
as
a
writer
of
fiction
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
Captain
screwed
his
lips
up
,
and
drummed
on
the
table
,
but
he
did
not
speak
.
 
<EOS>
She
thought
she
would
give
him
a
finishing
blow
or
two
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
consider
it
vulgar
,
and
below
the
dignity
of
literature
,
to
publish
in
numbers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
was
the
Rambler
published
,
ma'am
?
"
asked
Captain
Brown
in
a
low
voice
,
which
I
think
Miss
Jenkyns
could
not
have
heard
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dr
Johnson
's
style
is
a
model
for
young
beginners
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
recommended
it
to
me
when
I
began
to
write
letters
 
I
have
formed
my
own
style
upon
it
;
I
recommended
it
to
your
favourite
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
very
sorry
for
him
to
exchange
his
style
for
any
such
pompous
writing
,
"
said
Captain
Brown
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
felt
this
as
a
personal
affront
,
in
a
way
of
which
the
Captain
had
not
dreamed
.
 
<EOS>
Epistolary
writing
she
and
her
friends
considered
as
her
forte
.
 
<EOS>
Many
a
copy
of
many
a
letter
have
I
seen
written
and
corrected
on
the
slate
,
before
she
"
seized
the
half
-
hour
just
previous
to
post
-
time
to
assure
"
her
friends
of
this
or
of
that
;
and
Dr
Johnson
was
,
as
she
said
,
her
model
in
these
compositions
.
 
<EOS>
She
drew
herself
up
with
dignity
,
and
only
replied
to
Captain
Brown
's
last
remark
by
saying
,
with
marked
emphasis
on
every
syllable
,
"
I
prefer
Dr
Johnson
to
Mr
Boz
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
said
 
I
wo
n't
vouch
for
the
fact
 
that
Captain
Brown
was
heard
to
say
,
sotto
voce
,
"
D
-
<EOS>
n
Dr
Johnson
!
"
 
<EOS>
If
he
did
,
he
was
penitent
afterwards
,
as
he
showed
by
going
to
stand
near
Miss
Jenkyns
'
arm
-
chair
,
and
endeavouring
to
beguile
her
into
conversation
on
some
more
pleasing
subject
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
was
inexorable
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
day
she
made
the
remark
I
have
mentioned
about
Miss
Jessie
's
dimples
.
   
<EOS>
THE
CAPTAIN
 
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
live
a
month
at
Cranford
and
not
know
the
daily
habits
of
each
resident
;
and
long
before
my
visit
was
ended
<EOS>
I
knew
much
concerning
the
whole
Brown
trio
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
new
to
be
discovered
respecting
their
poverty
;
for
they
had
spoken
simply
and
openly
about
that
from
the
very
first
.
 
<EOS>
They
made
no
mystery
of
the
necessity
for
their
being
economical
.
 
<EOS>
All
that
remained
to
be
discovered
was
the
Captain
's
infinite
kindness
of
heart
,
and
the
various
modes
in
which
,
unconsciously
to
himself
,
he
manifested
it
.
 
<EOS>
Some
little
anecdotes
were
talked
about
for
some
time
after
they
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
did
not
read
much
,
and
as
all
the
ladies
were
pretty
well
suited
with
servants
,
there
was
a
dearth
of
subjects
for
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
We
therefore
discussed
the
circumstance
of
the
Captain
taking
a
poor
old
woman
's
dinner
out
of
her
hands
one
very
slippery
Sunday
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
met
her
returning
from
the
bakehouse
as
he
came
from
church
,
and
noticed
her
precarious
footing
;
and
,
with
the
grave
dignity
with
which
he
did
everything
,
he
relieved
her
of
her
burden
,
and
steered
along
the
street
by
her
side
,
carrying
her
baked
mutton
and
potatoes
safely
home
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
thought
very
eccentric
;
and
it
was
rather
expected
that
he
would
pay
a
round
of
calls
,
on
the
Monday
morning
,
to
explain
and
apologise
to
the
Cranford
sense
of
propriety
:
 
<EOS>
but
he
did
no
such
thing
:
 
<EOS>
and
then
it
was
decided
that
he
was
ashamed
,
and
was
keeping
out
of
sight
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
kindly
pity
for
him
,
we
began
to
say
,
"
After
all
,
the
Sunday
morning
's
occurrence
showed
great
goodness
of
heart
,
"
and
it
was
resolved
that
he
should
be
comforted
on
his
next
appearance
amongst
us
;
but
,
lo
!
<EOS>
he
came
down
upon
us
,
untouched
by
any
sense
of
shame
,
speaking
loud
and
bass
as
ever
,
his
head
thrown
back
,
his
wig
as
jaunty
and
well
-
curled
as
usual
,
and
we
were
obliged
to
conclude
he
had
forgotten
all
about
Sunday
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
and
Miss
Jessie
Brown
had
set
up
a
kind
of
intimacy
on
the
strength
of
the
Shetland
wool
and
the
new
knitting
stitches
;
so
it
happened
that
when
I
went
to
visit
Miss
Pole
I
saw
more
of
the
Browns
than
I
had
done
while
staying
with
Miss
Jenkyns
,
who
had
never
got
over
what
she
called
Captain
Brown
's
disparaging
remarks
upon
Dr
Johnson
as
a
writer
of
light
and
agreeable
fiction
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
that
Miss
Brown
was
seriously
ill
of
some
lingering
,
incurable
complaint
,
the
pain
occasioned
by
which
gave
the
uneasy
expression
to
her
face
that
I
had
taken
for
unmitigated
crossness
.
<EOS>
Cross
,
too
,
she
was
at
times
,
when
the
nervous
irritability
occasioned
by
her
disease
became
past
endurance
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jessie
bore
with
her
at
these
times
,
even
more
patiently
than
she
did
with
the
bitter
self
-
upbraidings
by
which
they
were
invariably
succeeded
.
<EOS>
Miss
Brown
used
to
accuse
herself
,
not
merely
of
hasty
and
irritable
temper
,
but
also
of
being
the
cause
why
her
father
and
sister
were
obliged
to
pinch
,
in
order
to
allow
her
the
small
luxuries
which
were
necessaries
in
her
condition
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
so
fain
have
made
sacrifices
for
them
,
and
have
lightened
their
cares
,
that
the
original
generosity
of
her
disposition
added
acerbity
to
her
temper
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
was
borne
by
Miss
Jessie
and
her
father
with
more
than
placidity
 
with
absolute
tenderness
.
 
<EOS>
I
forgave
Miss
Jessie
her
singing
out
of
tune
,
and
her
juvenility
of
dress
,
when
I
saw
her
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
to
perceive
that
Captain
Brown
's
dark
Brutus
wig
and
padded
coat
<EOS>
(
alas
!
too
often
threadbare
)
were
remnants
of
the
military
smartness
of
his
youth
,
which
he
now
wore
unconsciously
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
of
infinite
resources
,
gained
in
his
barrack
experience
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
confessed
,
no
one
could
black
his
boots
to
please
him
except
himself
;
but
,
indeed
,
he
was
not
above
saving
the
little
maid
-
servant
's
labours
in
every
way
 
<EOS>
knowing
,
most
likely
,
that
his
daughter
's
illness
made
the
place
a
hard
one
.
  
<EOS>
He
endeavoured
to
make
peace
with
Miss
Jenkyns
soon
after
the
memorable
dispute
I
have
named
,
by
a
present
of
a
wooden
fire
-
shovel
(
his
own
making
)
,
having
heard
her
say
how
much
the
grating
of
an
iron
one
annoyed
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
received
the
present
with
cool
gratitude
,
and
thanked
him
formally
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
was
gone
,
she
bade
me
put
it
away
in
the
lumber
-
room
;
feeling
,
probably
,
that
no
present
from
a
man
who
preferred
Mr
Boz
to
Dr
Johnson
could
be
less
jarring
than
an
iron
fire
-
shovel
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
the
state
of
things
when
I
left
Cranford
and
went
to
Drumble
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
,
however
,
several
correspondents
,
who
kept
me
au
fait
as
to
the
proceedings
of
the
dear
little
town
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
Miss
Pole
,
who
was
becoming
as
much
absorbed
in
crochet
as
she
had
been
once
in
knitting
,
and
<EOS>
the
burden
of
whose
letter
was
something
like
,
"
<EOS>
But
do
n't
you
forget
the
white
worsted
at
Flint
's
"
of
the
old
song
;
for
at
the
end
of
every
sentence
of
news
came
a
fresh
direction
as
to
some
crochet
commission
which
I
was
to
execute
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matilda
Jenkyns
(
who
did
not
mind
being
called
Miss
Matty
,
when
Miss
Jenkyns
was
not
by
)
wrote
nice
,
kind
,
rambling
letters
,
now
and
then
venturing
into
an
opinion
of
her
own
;
but
suddenly
pulling
herself
up
,
and
either
begging
me
not
to
name
what
she
had
said
,
as
Deborah
thought
differently
,
and
SHE
knew
,
or
else
putting
in
a
postscript
to
the
effect
that
,
since
writing
the
above
,
she
had
been
talking
over
the
subject
with
Deborah
,
and
was
quite
convinced
that
,
etc
.
 
<EOS>
(
here
probably
followed
a
recantation
of
every
opinion
she
had
given
in
the
letter
)
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
Miss
Jenkyns
 
Deborah
,
as
she
liked
Miss
Matty
to
call
her
<EOS>
,
her
father
having
once
said
that
the
Hebrew
name
ought
to
be
so
pronounced
.
 
<EOS>
I
secretly
think
she
took
the
Hebrew
prophetess
for
a
model
in
character
;
and
,
indeed
,
she
was
not
unlike
the
stern
prophetess
in
some
ways
,
making
allowance
,
of
course
,
for
modern
customs
and
difference
in
dress
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
wore
a
cravat
,
and
a
little
bonnet
like
a
jockey
-
cap
,
and
altogether
had
the
appearance
of
a
strong
-
minded
woman
;
although
she
would
have
despised
the
modern
idea
of
women
being
equal
to
men
.
 
<EOS>
Equal
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
she
knew
they
were
superior
.
 
<EOS>
But
to
return
to
her
letters
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
in
them
was
stately
and
grand
like
herself
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
looking
them
over
(
dear
Miss
Jenkyns
<EOS>
,
how
I
honoured
her
!
)
<EOS>
and
I
will
give
an
extract
,
more
especially
because
it
relates
to
our
friend
Captain
Brown
:
    
<EOS>
"
The
Honourable
Mrs
Jamieson
has
only
just
quitted
me
;
and
,
in
the
course
of
conversation
,
she
communicated
to
me
the
intelligence
that
she
had
yesterday
received
a
call
from
her
revered
husband
's
quondam
friend
,
Lord
Mauleverer
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
not
easily
conjecture
what
brought
his
lordship
within
the
precincts
of
our
little
town
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
see
Captain
Brown
,
with
whom
,
it
appears
,
his
lordship
was
acquainted
in
the
"
plumed
wars
,
"
and
who
had
the
privilege
of
averting
destruction
from
his
lordship
's
head
when
some
great
peril
was
impending
over
it
,
off
the
misnomered
Cape
of
Good
Hope
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
our
friend
the
Honourable
Mrs
Jamieson
's
deficiency
in
the
spirit
of
innocent
curiosity
,
and
you
will
therefore
not
be
so
much
surprised
when
I
tell
you
she
was
quite
unable
to
disclose
to
me
the
exact
nature
of
the
peril
in
question
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
anxious
<EOS>
,
I
confess
,
to
ascertain
in
what
manner
Captain
Brown
,
with
his
limited
establishment
,
could
receive
<EOS>
so
distinguished
a
guest
;
and
I
discovered
that
his
lordship
retired
to
rest
,
and
,
let
us
hope
,
to
refreshing
slumbers
,
at
the
Angel
Hotel
;
but
shared
the
Brunonian
meals
during
the
two
days
that
he
honoured
Cranford
with
his
august
presence
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Johnson
,
our
civil
butcher
's
wife
,
informs
me
that
Miss
Jessie
purchased
a
leg
of
lamb
;
but
,
besides
this
,
I
can
hear
of
no
preparation
whatever
to
give
a
suitable
reception
to
so
distinguished
a
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
they
entertained
him
with
"
the
feast
of
reason
and
the
flow
of
soul
"
;
and
to
us
,
who
are
acquainted
with
Captain
Brown
's
sad
want
of
relish
for
"
the
pure
wells
of
English
undefiled
,
"
it
may
be
matter
for
congratulation
that
he
has
had
the
opportunity
of
improving
his
taste
by
holding
converse
with
an
elegant
and
refined
member
of
the
British
aristocracy
.
 
<EOS>
But
from
some
mundane
failings
who
is
altogether
free
?
"
  
Miss
Pole
and
Miss
Matty
wrote
to
me
by
the
same
post
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
piece
of
news
as
Lord
Mauleverer
's
visit
was
not
to
be
lost
on
the
Cranford
letter
-
writers
:
 
<EOS>
they
made
the
most
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
humbly
apologised
for
writing
at
the
same
time
as
her
sister
,
who
was
so
much
more
capable
than
she
to
describe
the
honour
done
to
Cranford
;
but
in
spite
of
a
little
bad
spelling
,
Miss
Matty
's
account
gave
me
the
best
idea
of
the
commotion
occasioned
by
his
lordship
's
visit
,
after
it
had
occurred
;
for
,
except
the
people
at
the
Angel
,
the
Browns
,
Mrs
Jamieson
,
and
a
little
lad
his
lordship
had
sworn
at
for
driving
a
dirty
hoop
against
the
aristocratic
legs
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
hear
of
any
one
with
whom
his
lordship
had
held
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
My
next
visit
to
Cranford
was
in
the
summer
.
 
<EOS>
There
had
been
neither
births
,
deaths
,
nor
marriages
since
I
was
there
last
.
<EOS>
Everybody
lived
in
the
same
house
,
and
wore
pretty
nearly
the
same
well
-
preserved
,
old
-
fashioned
clothes
.
 
<EOS>
The
greatest
event
was
,
that
Miss
Jenkyns
had
purchased
a
new
carpet
for
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
the
busy
work
Miss
Matty
<EOS>
and
I
had
in
chasing
the
sunbeams
,
as
they
fell
in
an
afternoon
right
down
on
this
carpet
through
the
blindless
window
!
 
<EOS>
We
spread
newspapers
over
the
places
and
sat
down
to
our
book
or
our
work
;
and
,
lo
!
<EOS>
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
sun
had
moved
,
and
was
blazing
away
on
a
fresh
spot
;
and
down
again
we
went
on
our
knees
to
alter
the
position
of
the
newspapers
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
very
busy
,
too
,
one
whole
morning
,
before
Miss
Jenkyns
gave
her
party
,
in
following
her
directions
,
and
in
cutting
out
and
stitching
together
pieces
of
newspaper
so
as
to
form
little
paths
to
every
chair
set
for
the
expected
visitors
,
lest
their
shoes
might
dirty
or
defile
the
purity
of
the
carpet
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
make
paper
paths
for
every
guest
to
walk
upon
in
London
?
  
<EOS>
Captain
Brown
and
Miss
Jenkyns
were
not
very
cordial
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
The
literary
dispute
,
of
which
I
had
seen
the
beginning
,
was
a
"
raw
,
"
the
slightest
touch
on
which
made
them
wince
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
only
difference
of
opinion
they
had
ever
had
;
but
that
difference
was
enough
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
could
not
refrain
from
talking
at
Captain
Brown
;
and
,
though
he
did
not
reply
,
he
drummed
with
his
fingers
,
which
action
<EOS>
she
felt
and
resented
as
very
disparaging
to
Dr
Johnson
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
rather
ostentatious
in
his
preference
of
the
writings
of
Mr
Boz
;
would
walk
through
the
streets
so
absorbed
in
them
that
he
all
but
ran
against
Miss
Jenkyns
;
and
though
his
apologies
were
earnest
and
sincere
,
and
though
he
did
not
,
in
fact
,
do
more
than
startle
her
and
himself
,
she
owned
to
me
<EOS>
she
had
<EOS>
rather
he
had
knocked
her
down
,
if
he
had
only
been
reading
a
higher
style
of
literature
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
,
brave
Captain
!
<EOS>
he
looked
older
,
and
more
worn
,
and
his
clothes
were
very
threadbare
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
seemed
as
bright
and
cheerful
as
ever
,
unless
he
was
asked
about
his
daughter
's
health
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
suffers
a
great
deal
,
and
she
must
suffer
more
:
 
<EOS>
we
do
what
we
can
to
alleviate
her
pain
;
 
God
's
will
be
done
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
took
off
his
hat
at
these
last
words
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
,
from
Miss
Matty
,
that
everything
had
been
done
,
in
fact
.
 
<EOS>
A
medical
man
,
of
high
repute
in
that
country
neighbourhood
,
had
been
sent
for
,
and
every
injunction
he
had
given
was
attended
to
,
regardless
of
expense
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
was
sure
they
denied
themselves
many
things
in
order
to
make
the
invalid
comfortable
;
but
they
never
spoke
about
it
;
and
as
for
Miss
Jessie
!
 
<EOS>
"
I
really
think
she
's
an
angel
,
"
said
poor
Miss
Matty
,
quite
overcome
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
see
her
way
of
bearing
with
Miss
Brown
's
crossness
,
and
the
bright
face
she
puts
on
after
she
's
been
sitting
up
a
whole
night
and
scolded
above
half
of
it
,
is
quite
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Yet
she
looks
as
neat
and
as
ready
to
welcome
the
Captain
at
breakfast
-
time
as
if
she
had
been
asleep
in
the
Queen
's
bed
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
!
<EOS>
you
could
never
laugh
at
her
prim
little
curls
or
her
pink
bows
again
if
you
saw
her
as
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
could
only
feel
very
penitent
,
and
greet
Miss
Jessie
with
double
respect
when
I
met
her
next
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
faded
and
pinched
;
and
her
lips
began
to
quiver
,
as
if
she
was
very
weak
,
when
she
spoke
of
her
sister
.
<EOS>
But
she
brightened
,
and
sent
back
the
tears
that
were
glittering
in
her
pretty
eyes
,
as
she
said
     
<EOS>
"
But
,
to
be
sure
,
what
a
town
Cranford
is
for
kindness
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
any
one
has
a
better
dinner
than
usual
cooked
but
the
best
part
of
all
comes
in
a
little
covered
basin
for
my
sister
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
people
will
leave
their
earliest
vegetables
at
our
door
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
They
speak
short
and
gruff
,
as
if
they
were
ashamed
of
it
:
but
I
am
sure
it
often
goes
to
my
heart
to
see
their
thoughtfulness
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
tears
now
came
back
and
overflowed
;
but
after
a
minute
or
two
she
began
to
scold
herself
,
and
ended
by
going
away
the
same
cheerful
Miss
Jessie
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
does
not
this
Lord
Mauleverer
do
something
for
the
man
who
saved
his
life
?
"
said
I.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
see
,
unless
Captain
Brown
has
some
reason
for
it
,
he
never
speaks
about
being
poor
;
and
he
walked
along
by
his
lordship
looking
as
happy
and
cheerful
as
a
prince
;
and
as
they
never
called
attention
to
their
dinner
by
apologies
,
and
as
Miss
Brown
was
better
that
day
,
and
all
seemed
bright
<EOS>
,
I
daresay
his
lordship
never
knew
how
much
care
there
was
in
the
background
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
send
game
in
the
winter
pretty
often
,
but
now
he
is
gone
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
often
occasion
to
notice
the
use
that
was
made
of
fragments
and
small
opportunities
in
Cranford
;
the
rose
-
leaves
that
were
gathered
ere
they
fell
to
make
into
a
potpourri
for
someone
who
had
no
garden
;
the
little
bundles
of
lavender
flowers
sent
to
strew
the
drawers
of
some
town
-
dweller
,
or
to
burn
in
the
chamber
of
some
invalid
.
 
<EOS>
Things
that
many
would
despise
,
and
actions
which
it
seemed
scarcely
worth
while
to
perform
,
were
all
attended
to
in
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
stuck
an
apple
full
of
cloves
,
to
be
heated
and
smell
pleasantly
in
Miss
Brown
's
room
;
and
as
she
put
in
each
clove
she
uttered
a
Johnsonian
sentence
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
she
never
could
think
of
the
Browns
without
talking
Johnson
;
and
,
as
they
were
seldom
absent
from
her
thoughts
just
then
,
I
heard
many
a
rolling
,
three
-
piled
sentence
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Brown
called
one
day
to
thank
Mist
Jenkyns
for
many
little
kindnesses
,
which
I
did
not
know
until
then
that
she
had
rendered
.
<EOS>
He
had
suddenly
become
like
an
old
man
;
his
deep
bass
voice
had
a
quavering
in
it
,
his
eyes
looked
dim
,
and
the
lines
on
his
face
were
deep
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
 
could
not
 
speak
cheerfully
of
his
daughter
's
state
,
but
he
talked
with
manly
,
pious
resignation
,
and
not
much
.
 
<EOS>
Twice
over
<EOS>
he
said
,
"
What
Jessie
has
been
to
us
,
God
only
knows
!
"
<EOS>
and
after
the
second
time
,
he
got
up
hastily
,
shook
hands
all
round
without
speaking
,
and
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
That
afternoon
we
perceived
little
groups
in
the
street
,
all
listening
with
faces
aghast
to
some
tale
or
other
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
wondered
what
could
be
the
matter
for
some
time
before
she
took
the
undignified
step
of
sending
Jenny
out
to
inquire
.
  
<EOS>
Jenny
came
back
with
a
white
face
of
terror
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
ma'am
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
Miss
Jenkyns
,
ma'am
!
 
<EOS>
Captain
Brown
is
killed
by
them
nasty
cruel
railroads
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
burst
into
tears
.
 
<EOS>
She
,
along
with
many
others
,
had
experienced
the
poor
Captain
's
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
?
 
<EOS>
where
 
where
?
 
<EOS>
Good
God
!
 
<EOS>
Jenny
,
do
n't
waste
time
in
crying
,
but
tell
us
something
.
"
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
rushed
out
into
the
street
at
once
,
and
collared
the
man
who
was
telling
the
tale
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
in
 
come
to
my
sister
at
once
,
Miss
Jenkyns
,
the
rector
's
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
man
,
man
!
<EOS>
say
it
is
not
true
,
"
she
cried
,
as
she
brought
the
affrighted
carter
,
sleeking
down
his
hair
,
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
where
he
stood
with
his
wet
boots
on
the
new
carpet
,
and
no
one
regarded
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Please
,
mum
,
it
is
true
.
 
<EOS>
I
seed
it
myself
,
"
and
he
shuddered
at
the
recollection
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Captain
was
a
-
reading
some
new
book
as
he
was
deep
in
,
a
-
waiting
for
the
down
train
;
and
there
was
a
little
lass
as
wanted
to
come
to
its
mammy
,
and
gave
its
sister
the
slip
,
and
came
toddling
across
the
line
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
looked
up
sudden
,
at
the
sound
of
the
train
coming
,
and
seed
the
child
,
and
he
darted
on
the
line
and
cotched
it
up
,
and
his
foot
slipped
,
and
the
train
came
over
him
in
no
time
.
 
<EOS>
O
Lord
,
Lord
!
 
<EOS>
Mum
,
it
's
quite
true
,
and
they
've
come
over
to
tell
his
daughters
.
 
<EOS>
The
child
's
safe
,
though
,
with
only
a
bang
on
its
shoulder
as
he
threw
it
to
its
mammy
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Captain
would
be
glad
of
that
,
mum
,
would
n't
he
?
 
<EOS>
God
bless
him
!
"
<EOS>
The
great
rough
carter
puckered
up
his
manly
face
,
and
turned
away
to
hide
his
tears
.
 
<EOS>
I
turned
to
Miss
Jenkyns
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
very
ill
,
as
if
she
were
going
to
faint
,
and
signed
to
me
to
open
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
Matilda
,
bring
me
my
bonnet
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
go
to
those
girls
.
 
<EOS>
God
pardon
me
,
if
ever
I
have
spoken
contemptuously
to
the
Captain
!
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
arrayed
herself
to
go
out
,
telling
Miss
Matilda
to
give
the
man
a
glass
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
While
she
was
away
,
Miss
Matty
<EOS>
and
I
huddled
over
the
fire
,
talking
in
a
low
and
awe
-
struck
voice
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
we
cried
quietly
all
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
came
home
in
a
silent
mood
,
and
we
durst
not
ask
her
many
questions
.
 
<EOS>
She
told
us
that
Miss
Jessie
had
fainted
,
and
that
she
and
Miss
Pole
had
had
some
difficulty
in
bringing
her
round
;
but
that
,
as
soon
as
she
recovered
,
she
begged
one
of
them
to
go
and
sit
with
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Hoggins
says
she
can
not
live
many
days
,
and
she
shall
be
spared
this
shock
,
"
said
Miss
Jessie
,
shivering
with
feelings
to
which
she
dared
not
give
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
how
can
you
manage
,
my
dear
?
"
asked
Miss
Jenkyns
;
"
you
can
not
bear
up
,
she
must
see
your
tears
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
will
help
me
 
I
will
not
give
way
 
<EOS>
she
was
asleep
when
the
news
came
;
she
may
be
asleep
yet
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
be
so
utterly
miserable
,
not
merely
at
my
father
's
death
,
but
to
think
of
what
would
become
of
me
;
she
is
so
good
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
looked
up
earnestly
in
their
faces
with
her
soft
true
eyes
,
and
Miss
Pole
told
Miss
Jenkyns
afterwards
<EOS>
she
could
hardly
bear
it
,
knowing
,
as
she
did
<EOS>
,
how
Miss
Brown
treated
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
it
was
settled
according
to
Miss
Jessie
's
wish
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Brown
was
to
be
told
her
father
had
been
summoned
to
take
a
short
journey
on
railway
business
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
managed
it
in
some
way
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
could
not
exactly
say
how
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
was
to
stop
with
Miss
Jessie
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
had
sent
to
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
was
all
we
heard
that
night
;
and
a
sorrowful
night
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
day
a
full
account
of
the
fatal
accident
was
in
the
county
paper
which
Miss
Jenkyns
took
in
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
very
weak
,
she
said
,
and
she
asked
me
to
read
it
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
came
to
the
"
gallant
gentleman
was
deeply
engaged
in
the
perusal
of
a
number
of
"
Pickwick
,
"
which
he
had
just
received
,
<EOS>
"
Miss
Jenkyns
shook
her
head
long
and
solemnly
,
and
then
sighed
out
,
"
Poor
,
dear
,
infatuated
man
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
corpse
was
to
be
taken
from
the
station
to
the
parish
church
,
there
to
be
interred
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jessie
had
set
her
heart
on
following
it
to
the
grave
;
and
no
dissuasives
could
alter
her
resolve
.
 
<EOS>
Her
restraint
upon
herself
made
her
almost
obstinate
;
she
resisted
all
Miss
Pole
's
entreaties
and
Miss
Jenkyns
'
advice
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
Miss
Jenkyns
gave
up
the
point
;
and
after
a
silence
,
which
I
feared
portended
some
deep
displeasure
against
Miss
Jessie
,
Miss
Jenkyns
said
she
should
accompany
the
latter
to
the
funeral
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
fit
for
you
to
go
alone
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
against
both
propriety
and
humanity
<EOS>
were
I
to
allow
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Jessie
seemed
as
if
she
did
not
half
like
this
arrangement
;
but
her
obstinacy
,
if
she
had
any
,
had
been
exhausted
in
her
determination
to
go
to
the
interment
.
 
<EOS>
She
longed
,
poor
thing
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
to
cry
alone
over
the
grave
of
the
dear
father
to
whom
she
had
been
all
in
all
,
and
to
give
way
,
for
one
little
half
-
hour
,
uninterrupted
by
sympathy
and
unobserved
by
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
That
afternoon
Miss
Jenkyns
sent
out
for
a
yard
of
black
crape
,
and
employed
herself
busily
in
trimming
the
little
black
silk
bonnet
I
have
spoken
about
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
was
finished
she
put
it
on
,
and
looked
at
us
for
approbation
 
admiration
she
despised
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
full
of
sorrow
,
but
,
by
one
of
those
whimsical
thoughts
which
come
unbidden
into
our
heads
,
in
times
of
deepest
grief
,
I
no
sooner
saw
the
bonnet
than
I
was
reminded
of
a
helmet
;
and
in
that
hybrid
bonnet
,
half
helmet
,
half
jockey
-
cap
,
did
Miss
Jenkyns
attend
Captain
Brown
's
funeral
,
and
,
I
believe
,
supported
Miss
Jessie
with
a
tender
,
indulgent
firmness
which
was
invaluable
,
allowing
her
to
weep
her
passionate
fill
before
they
left
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
,
Miss
Matty
,
and
I
,
meanwhile
attended
to
Miss
Brown
:
and
hard
work
we
found
it
to
relieve
her
querulous
and
never
-
ending
complaints
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
we
were
so
weary
and
dispirited
,
what
must
Miss
Jessie
have
been
!
 
<EOS>
Yet
she
came
back
almost
calm
as
if
she
had
gained
a
new
strength
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
off
her
mourning
dress
,
and
came
in
,
looking
pale
and
gentle
,
thanking
us
each
with
a
soft
long
pressure
of
the
hand
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
even
smile
 
a
faint
,
sweet
,
wintry
smile
 
as
if
to
reassure
us
of
her
power
to
endure
;
but
her
look
made
our
eyes
fill
suddenly
with
tears
,
more
than
if
she
had
cried
outright
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
settled
that
Miss
Pole
was
to
remain
with
her
all
the
watching
livelong
night
;
and
that
Miss
Matty
and
I
were
to
return
in
the
morning
to
relieve
them
,
and
give
Miss
Jessie
the
opportunity
for
a
few
hours
of
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
the
morning
came
,
Miss
Jenkyns
appeared
at
the
breakfast
-
table
,
equipped
in
her
helmet
-
bonnet
,
and
ordered
Miss
Matty
to
stay
at
home
,
as
she
meant
to
go
and
help
to
nurse
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
evidently
in
a
state
of
great
friendly
excitement
,
which
she
showed
by
eating
her
breakfast
standing
,
and
scolding
the
household
all
round
.
  
<EOS>
No
nursing
 
<EOS>
no
energetic
strong
-
minded
woman
could
help
Miss
Brown
now
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
that
in
the
room
as
we
entered
which
was
stronger
than
us
all
,
and
made
us
shrink
into
solemn
awestruck
helplessness
.
<EOS>
Miss
Brown
was
dying
.
 
<EOS>
We
hardly
knew
her
voice
,
it
was
so
devoid
of
the
complaining
tone
we
had
always
associated
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jessie
told
me
afterwards
that
it
,
and
her
face
too
,
were
just
what
they
had
been
formerly
,
when
her
mother
's
death
left
her
the
young
anxious
head
of
the
family
,
of
whom
only
Miss
Jessie
survived
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
conscious
of
her
sister
's
presence
,
though
not
,
I
think
,
of
ours
.
 
<EOS>
We
stood
a
little
behind
the
curtain
:
 
Miss
Jessie
knelt
with
her
face
near
her
sister
's
,
in
order
to
catch
the
last
soft
awful
whispers
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Jessie
!
 
<EOS>
Jessie
!
 
<EOS>
How
selfish
I
have
been
!
 
<EOS>
God
forgive
me
for
letting
you
sacrifice
yourself
for
me
as
you
did
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
so
loved
you
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
have
thought
only
of
myself
.
 
<EOS>
God
forgive
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
love
!
<EOS>
hush
!
<EOS>
"
said
Miss
Jessie
,
sobbing
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
my
father
,
my
dear
,
dear
father
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
complain
now
,
if
God
will
give
me
strength
to
be
patient
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
oh
,
Jessie
!
<EOS>
tell
my
father
how
I
longed
and
yearned
to
see
him
at
last
,
and
to
ask
his
forgiveness
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
never
know
now
how
I
loved
him
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
if
I
might
but
tell
him
,
before
I
die
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
life
of
sorrow
his
has
been
,
and
I
have
done
so
little
to
cheer
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
light
came
into
Miss
Jessie
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Would
it
comfort
you
,
dearest
,
to
think
that
he
does
know
?
 
<EOS>
would
it
comfort
you
,
love
,
to
know
that
his
cares
,
his
sorrows
"
 
H
er
voice
quivered
,
but
she
steadied
it
into
calmness
 
<EOS>
"
Mary
!
<EOS>
he
has
gone
before
you
to
the
place
where
the
weary
are
at
rest
.
 
<EOS>
He
knows
now
how
you
loved
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
strange
look
,
which
was
not
distress
,
came
over
Miss
Brown
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
speak
for
come
time
,
but
then
we
saw
her
lips
form
the
words
,
rather
than
heard
the
sound
 
"
Father
,
mother
,
Harry
,
Archy
;
"
 
then
,
as
if
it
were
a
new
idea
throwing
a
filmy
shadow
over
her
darkened
mind
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
be
alone
,
Jessie
!
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Jessie
had
been
feeling
this
all
during
the
silence
,
I
think
;
for
the
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
like
rain
,
at
these
words
,
and
she
could
not
answer
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
put
her
hands
together
tight
,
and
lifted
them
up
,
and
said
 
but
not
to
us
 
"
<EOS>
Though
He
slay
me
,
yet
will
I
trust
in
Him

<EOS>
In
a
few
moments
more
Miss
Brown
lay
calm
and
still
 
never
to
sorrow
or
murmur
more
.
  
<EOS>
After
this
second
funeral
,
Miss
Jenkyns
insisted
that
Miss
Jessie
should
come
to
stay
with
her
rather
than
go
back
to
the
desolate
house
,
which
,
in
fact
,
we
learned
from
Miss
Jessie
,
must
now
be
given
up
,
as
she
had
not
wherewithal
to
maintain
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
something
above
twenty
pounds
a
year
,
besides
the
interest
of
the
money
for
which
the
furniture
would
sell
;
but
she
could
not
live
upon
that
:
 
<EOS>
and
so
we
talked
over
her
qualifications
for
earning
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
sew
neatly
,
"
said
she
,
"
and
I
like
nursing
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
too
<EOS>
,
I
could
manage
a
house
,
if
any
one
would
try
me
as
housekeeper
;
or
I
would
go
into
a
shop
as
saleswoman
,
if
they
would
have
patience
with
me
at
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
declared
,
in
an
angry
voice
,
that
she
should
do
no
such
thing
;
and
talked
to
herself
about
"
some
people
having
no
idea
of
their
rank
as
a
captain
's
daughter
,
"
nearly
an
hour
afterwards
,
when
she
brought
Miss
Jessie
up
a
basin
of
delicately
-
made
arrowroot
,
and
stood
over
her
like
a
dragoon
until
the
last
spoonful
was
finished
:
 
then
she
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jessie
began
to
tell
me
some
more
of
the
plans
which
had
suggested
themselves
to
her
,
and
insensibly
fell
into
talking
of
the
days
that
were
past
and
gone
,
and
interested
me
so
much
I
neither
knew
nor
heeded
how
time
passed
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
both
startled
when
Miss
Jenkyns
reappeared
,
and
caught
us
crying
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
lest
she
would
be
displeased
,
as
she
often
said
that
crying
hindered
digestion
,
and
I
knew
she
wanted
Miss
Jessie
to
get
strong
;
but
,
instead
,
she
looked
queer
and
excited
,
and
fidgeted
round
us
without
saying
anything
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
she
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
so
much
startled
 
<EOS>
no
,
I
've
not
been
at
all
startled
 
<EOS>
do
n't
mind
me
,
my
dear
Miss
Jessie
 
<EOS>
I
've
been
very
much
surprised
 
in
fact
,
I
've
had
a
caller
,
whom
you
knew
once
,
my
dear
Miss
Jessie
"
     
Miss
Jessie
went
very
white
,
then
flushed
scarlet
,
and
looked
eagerly
at
Miss
Jenkyns
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
gentleman
,
my
dear
,
who
wants
to
know
if
you
would
see
him
.
"
  
"
Is
it
?
 
<EOS>
it
is
not
"
 
<EOS>
s
tammered
out
Miss
Jessie
 
and
got
no
farther
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
his
card
,
"
said
Miss
Jenkyns
,
giving
it
to
Miss
Jessie
;
and
while
her
head
was
bent
over
it
,
Miss
Jenkyns
went
through
a
series
of
winks
and
odd
faces
to
me
,
and
formed
her
lips
into
a
long
sentence
,
of
which
,
of
course
,
I
could
not
understand
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
he
come
up
?
"
asked
Miss
Jenkyns
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
!
<EOS>
certainly
!
"
said
Miss
Jessie
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
this
is
your
house
,
you
may
show
any
visitor
where
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
up
some
knitting
of
Miss
Matty
's
and
began
to
be
very
busy
,
though
I
could
see
how
she
trembled
all
over
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
rang
the
bell
,
and
told
the
servant
who
answered
it
to
show
Major
Gordon
upstairs
;
and
,
presently
,
in
walked
a
tall
,
fine
,
frank
-
looking
man
of
forty
or
upwards
.
 
<EOS>
He
shook
hands
with
Miss
Jessie
;
but
he
could
not
see
her
eyes
,
she
kept
them
so
fixed
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
asked
me
if
I
would
come
and
help
her
to
tie
up
the
preserves
in
the
store
-
room
;
and
though
Miss
Jessie
plucked
at
my
gown
,
and
even
looked
up
at
me
with
begging
eye
,
I
durst
not
refuse
to
go
where
Miss
Jenkyns
asked
.
 
<EOS>
Instead
of
tying
up
preserves
in
the
store
-
room
,
however
,
we
went
to
talk
in
the
dining
-
room
;
and
there
Miss
Jenkyns
told
me
what
Major
Gordon
had
told
her
;
how
he
had
served
in
the
same
regiment
with
Captain
Brown
,
and
had
become
acquainted
with
Miss
Jessie
,
then
a
sweet
-
looking
,
blooming
girl
of
eighteen
;
how
the
acquaintance
had
grown
into
love
on
his
part
,
though
it
had
been
some
years
before
he
had
spoken
;
how
,
on
becoming
possessed
,
through
the
will
of
an
uncle
,
of
a
good
estate
in
Scotland
,
he
had
offered
and
been
refused
,
though
with
so
much
agitation
and
evident
distress
that
he
was
sure
she
was
not
indifferent
to
him
;
and
how
he
had
discovered
that
the
obstacle
was
the
fell
disease
which
was
,
even
then
,
too
surely
threatening
her
sister
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
mentioned
that
the
surgeons
foretold
intense
suffering
;
and
there
was
no
one
but
herself
to
nurse
her
poor
Mary
,
or
cheer
and
comfort
her
father
during
the
time
of
illness
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
had
long
discussions
;
and
on
her
refusal
to
pledge
herself
to
him
as
his
wife
when
all
should
be
over
,
he
had
grown
angry
,
and
broken
off
entirely
,
and
gone
abroad
,
believing
that
she
was
a
cold
-
hearted
person
whom
he
would
do
well
to
forget
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
been
travelling
in
the
East
,
and
was
on
his
return
home
when
,
at
Rome
,
he
saw
the
account
of
Captain
Brown
's
death
in
Galignani
.
  
<EOS>
Just
then
Miss
Matty
,
who
had
been
out
all
the
morning
,
and
had
only
lately
returned
to
the
house
,
burst
in
with
a
face
of
dismay
and
outraged
propriety
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
goodness
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Deborah
,
there
's
a
gentleman
sitting
in
the
drawing
-
room
with
his
arm
round
Miss
Jessie
's
waist
!
"
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
's
eyes
looked
large
with
terror
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
snubbed
her
down
in
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
most
proper
place
in
the
world
for
his
arm
to
be
in
.
 
<EOS>
Go
away
,
Matilda
,
and
mind
your
own
business
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
from
her
sister
,
<EOS>
who
had
hitherto
been
a
model
of
feminine
decorum
,
was
a
blow
for
poor
Miss
Matty
,
and
with
a
double
shock
she
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
last
time
I
ever
saw
poor
Miss
Jenkyns
was
many
years
after
this
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Gordon
had
kept
up
a
warm
and
affectionate
intercourse
with
all
at
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
,
Miss
Matty
,
and
Miss
Pole
had
all
been
to
visit
her
,
and
returned
with
wonderful
accounts
of
her
house
,
her
husband
,
her
dress
,
and
her
looks
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
with
happiness
,
something
of
her
early
bloom
returned
;
she
had
been
a
year
or
two
younger
than
we
had
taken
her
for
.
 
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
always
lovely
,
and
,
as
Mrs
Gordon
,
her
dimples
were
not
out
of
place
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
time
to
which
I
have
referred
,
when
I
last
saw
Miss
Jenkyns
,
that
lady
was
old
and
feeble
,
and
had
lost
something
of
her
strong
mind
.
<EOS>
Little
Flora
Gordon
was
staying
with
the
Misses
Jenkyns
,
and
when
I
came
in
she
was
reading
aloud
to
Miss
Jenkyns
,
who
lay
feeble
and
changed
on
the
sofa
.
 
<EOS>
Flora
put
down
the
Rambler
when
I
came
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Miss
Jenkyns
,
<EOS>
"
you
find
me
changed
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
If
ca
n't
see
as
I
used
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
Flora
were
not
here
to
read
to
me
<EOS>
,
I
hardly
know
how
I
should
get
through
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
read
the
Rambler
?
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
wonderful
book
 
<EOS>
wonderful
!
<EOS>
and
the
most
improving
reading
for
Flora
"
(
which
I
daresay
it
would
have
been
,
if
she
could
have
read
half
the
words
without
spelling
,
and
could
have
understood
the
meaning
of
a
third
)
,
"
better
than
that
strange
old
book
,
with
the
queer
name
,
poor
Captain
Brown
was
killed
for
reading
 
that
book
by
Mr
Boz
,
you
know
"
Old
Poz
'
;
when
I
was
a
girl
 
<EOS>
but
that
's
a
long
time
ago
 
<EOS>
I
acted
Lucy
in
"
Old
Poz
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
babbled
on
long
enough
for
Flora
to
get
a
good
long
spell
at
the
"
Christmas
Carol
,
"
which
Miss
Matty
had
left
on
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
A
LOVE
AFFAIR
OF
LONG
AGO
 
<EOS>
I
thought
that
probably
my
connection
with
Cranford
would
cease
after
Miss
Jenkyns
's
death
;
at
least
,
that
it
would
have
to
be
kept
up
by
correspondence
,
which
bears
much
the
same
relation
to
personal
intercourse
that
the
books
of
dried
plants
I
sometimes
see
(
"
Hortus
Siccus
,
"
I
think
they
call
the
thing
)
do
to
the
living
and
fresh
flowers
in
the
lines
and
meadows
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
,
therefore
,
by
receiving
a
letter
from
Miss
Pole
(
who
had
always
come
in
for
a
supplementary
week
after
my
annual
visit
to
Miss
Jenkyns
)
proposing
that
I
should
go
and
stay
with
her
;
and
then
,
in
a
couple
of
days
after
my
acceptance
,
came
a
note
from
Miss
Matty
,
in
which
,
in
a
rather
circuitous
and
very
humble
manner
,
she
told
me
how
much
pleasure
I
should
confer
if
I
could
spend
a
week
or
two
with
her
,
either
before
or
after
I
had
been
at
Miss
Pole
's
;
"
for
,
<EOS>
"
she
said
,
"
since
my
dear
sister
's
death
I
am
well
aware
I
have
no
attractions
to
offer
;
it
is
only
to
the
kindness
of
my
friends
that
I
can
owe
their
company
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Of
course
I
promised
to
come
to
dear
Miss
Matty
as
soon
as
I
had
ended
my
visit
to
Miss
Pole
;
and
the
day
after
my
arrival
at
Cranford
<EOS>
I
went
to
see
her
,
much
wondering
what
the
house
would
be
like
without
Miss
Jenkyns
,
and
rather
dreading
the
changed
aspect
of
things
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
began
to
cry
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
evidently
nervous
from
having
anticipated
my
call
.
 
<EOS>
I
comforted
her
as
well
as
I
could
;
and
I
found
the
best
consolation
I
could
give
was
the
honest
praise
that
came
from
my
heart
as
I
spoke
of
the
deceased
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
slowly
shook
her
head
over
each
virtue
as
it
was
named
and
attributed
to
her
sister
;
and
at
last
she
could
not
restrain
the
tears
which
had
long
been
silently
flowing
,
but
hid
her
face
behind
her
handkerchief
and
sobbed
aloud
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Miss
Matty
,
"
said
I
,
taking
her
hand
 
for
indeed
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
in
what
way
to
tell
her
how
sorry
I
was
for
her
,
left
deserted
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
She
put
down
her
handkerchief
and
said
     
"
<EOS>
My
dear
,
I
'd
<EOS>
rather
you
did
not
call
me
Matty
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
like
it
;
but
I
did
many
a
thing
she
did
not
like
<EOS>
,
I
'm
afraid
 
<EOS>
and
now
she
's
gone
!
 
<EOS>
If
you
please
,
my
love
,
will
you
call
me
Matilda
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
promised
faithfully
,
and
began
to
practise
the
new
name
with
Miss
Pole
that
very
day
;
and
,
by
degrees
,
<EOS>
Miss
Matilda
's
feeling
on
the
subject
was
known
through
Cranford
,
and
we
all
tried
to
drop
the
more
familiar
name
,
but
with
so
little
success
that
by
-
and
-
by
we
gave
up
the
attempt
.
  
<EOS>
My
visit
to
Miss
Pole
was
very
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
had
so
long
taken
the
lead
in
Cranford
that
now
she
was
gone
,
they
hardly
knew
how
to
give
a
party
.
 
<EOS>
The
Honourable
Mrs
Jamieson
,
to
whom
Miss
Jenkyns
herself
had
always
yielded
the
post
of
honour
,
was
fat
and
inert
,
and
very
much
at
the
mercy
of
her
old
servants
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
chose
that
she
should
give
a
party
,
they
reminded
her
of
the
necessity
for
so
doing
:
 
if
not
,
she
let
it
alone
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
all
the
more
time
for
me
to
hear
old
-
world
stories
from
Miss
Pole
,
while
she
sat
knitting
,
and
I
making
my
father
's
shirts
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
took
a
quantity
of
plain
sewing
to
Cranford
;
for
,
as
we
did
not
read
much
,
or
walk
much
,
I
found
it
a
capital
time
to
get
through
my
work
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
Miss
Pole
's
stories
related
to
a
shadow
of
a
love
affair
that
was
dimly
perceived
or
suspected
long
years
before
.
  
<EOS>
Presently
,
the
time
arrived
when
I
was
to
remove
to
Miss
Matilda
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
her
timid
and
anxious
about
the
arrangements
for
my
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
Many
a
time
,
while
I
was
unpacking
,
did
she
come
backwards
and
forwards
to
stir
the
fire
which
burned
all
the
worse
for
being
so
frequently
poked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
drawers
enough
,
dear
?
"
<EOS>
asked
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
exactly
how
my
sister
used
to
arrange
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
capital
methods
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
she
would
have
trained
a
servant
in
a
week
to
make
a
better
fire
than
this
,
and
Fanny
has
been
with
me
four
months
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
subject
of
servants
was
a
standing
grievance
,
and
I
could
not
wonder
much
at
it
;
for
if
gentlemen
were
scarce
,
and
almost
unheard
of
in
the
"
genteel
society
"
of
Cranford
,
they
or
their
counterparts
 
handsome
young
men
 
abounded
in
the
lower
classes
.
<EOS>
The
pretty
neat
servant
-
maids
had
their
choice
of
desirable
"
followers
"
;
and
their
mistresses
,
without
having
the
sort
of
mysterious
dread
of
men
and
matrimony
that
Miss
Matilda
had
,
might
well
feel
a
little
anxious
lest
the
heads
of
their
comely
maids
should
be
turned
by
the
joiner
,
or
the
butcher
,
or
the
gardener
,
who
were
obliged
,
by
their
callings
,
to
come
to
the
house
,
and
who
,
as
ill
-
luck
would
have
it
,
were
generally
handsome
and
unmarried
.
<EOS>
Fanny
's
lovers
,
if
she
had
any
 
and
Miss
Matilda
suspected
her
of
so
many
flirtations
that
,
if
she
had
not
been
very
pretty
,
I
should
have
doubted
her
having
one
 
were
a
constant
anxiety
to
her
mistress
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
forbidden
,
by
the
articles
of
her
engagement
,
to
have
"
followers
"
;
and
though
she
had
answered
,
innocently
enough
,
doubling
up
the
hem
of
her
apron
as
she
spoke
,
"
Please
,
ma'am
,
I
never
had
more
than
one
at
a
time
,
"
Miss
Matty
prohibited
that
one
.
<EOS>
But
a
vision
of
a
man
seemed
to
haunt
the
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
Fanny
assured
me
that
it
was
all
fancy
,
or
else
<EOS>
I
should
have
said
myself
that
I
had
seen
a
man
's
coat
-
tails
whisk
into
the
scullery
once
,
when
I
went
on
an
errand
into
the
store
-
room
at
night
;
and
another
evening
,
when
,
our
watches
having
stopped
,
I
went
to
look
at
the
clock
,
there
was
a
very
odd
appearance
,
singularly
like
a
young
man
squeezed
up
between
the
clock
and
the
back
of
the
open
kitchen
-
door
:
and
I
thought
Fanny
snatched
up
the
candle
very
hastily
,
so
as
to
throw
the
shadow
on
the
clock
face
,
while
she
very
positively
told
me
the
time
half
-
an
-
hour
too
early
,
as
we
found
out
afterwards
by
the
church
clock
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
did
not
add
to
Miss
Matty
's
anxieties
by
naming
my
suspicions
,
especially
as
Fanny
said
to
me
,
the
next
day
,
that
it
was
such
a
queer
kitchen
for
having
odd
shadows
about
it
<EOS>
,
she
really
was
almost
afraid
to
stay
;
"
for
you
know
,
miss
,
"
she
added
,
"
I
do
n't
see
a
creature
from
six
o'clock
tea
,
till
Missus
rings
the
bell
for
prayers
at
ten
.
"
  
<EOS>
However
,
it
so
fell
out
that
Fanny
had
to
leave
and
Miss
Matilda
begged
me
to
stay
and
"
settle
her
"
with
the
new
maid
;
to
which
I
consented
,
after
I
had
heard
from
my
father
that
he
did
not
want
me
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
The
new
servant
was
a
rough
,
honest
-
looking
,
country
girl
,
who
had
only
lived
in
a
farm
place
before
;
but
I
liked
her
looks
when
she
came
to
be
hired
;
and
I
promised
Miss
Matilda
to
put
her
in
the
ways
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
The
said
ways
were
religiously
such
as
Miss
Matilda
thought
her
sister
would
approve
.
 
<EOS>
Many
a
domestic
rule
and
regulation
had
been
a
subject
of
plaintive
whispered
murmur
to
me
during
Miss
Jenkyns
's
life
;
but
now
that
she
was
gone
,
I
do
not
think
that
even
I
,
who
was
a
favourite
,
durst
have
suggested
an
alteration
.
 
<EOS>
To
give
an
instance
:
 
<EOS>
we
constantly
adhered
to
the
forms
which
were
observed
,
at
meal
-
times
,
in
"
my
father
,
the
rector
's
house
.
"
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
we
had
always
wine
and
dessert
;
but
the
decanters
were
only
filled
when
there
was
a
party
,
and
what
remained
was
seldom
touched
,
though
we
had
two
wine
-
glasses
apiece
every
day
after
dinner
,
until
the
next
festive
occasion
arrived
,
when
the
state
of
the
remainder
wine
was
examined
into
in
a
family
council
.
 
<EOS>
The
dregs
were
often
given
to
the
poor
:
but
occasionally
,
when
a
good
deal
had
been
left
at
the
last
party
(
five
months
ago
,
it
might
be
)
,
it
was
added
to
some
of
a
fresh
bottle
,
brought
up
from
the
cellar
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
poor
Captain
Brown
did
not
much
like
wine
,
for
I
noticed
he
never
finished
his
first
glass
,
and
most
military
men
take
several
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
as
to
our
dessert
,
Miss
Jenkyns
used
to
gather
currants
and
gooseberries
for
it
herself
,
which
I
sometimes
thought
would
have
tasted
better
fresh
from
the
trees
;
but
then
,
as
Miss
Jenkyns
observed
,
there
would
have
been
nothing
for
dessert
in
summer
-
time
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
we
felt
very
genteel
with
our
two
glasses
apiece
,
and
a
dish
of
gooseberries
at
the
top
,
of
currants
and
biscuits
at
the
sides
,
and
two
decanters
at
the
bottom
.
 
<EOS>
When
oranges
came
in
,
a
curious
proceeding
was
gone
through
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
did
not
like
to
cut
the
fruit
;
for
,
as
she
observed
,
the
juice
all
ran
out
<EOS>
nobody
knew
where
;
sucking
(
only
I
think
she
used
some
more
recondite
word
)
was
in
fact
the
only
way
of
enjoying
oranges
;
but
then
there
was
the
unpleasant
association
with
a
ceremony
frequently
gone
through
by
little
babies
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
after
dessert
,
in
orange
season
,
Miss
Jenkyns
and
Miss
Matty
used
to
rise
up
,
possess
themselves
each
of
an
orange
in
silence
,
and
withdraw
to
the
privacy
of
their
own
rooms
to
indulge
in
sucking
oranges
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
once
or
twice
tried
,
on
such
occasions
,
to
prevail
on
Miss
Matty
to
stay
,
and
had
succeeded
in
her
sister
's
lifetime
.
 
<EOS>
I
held
up
a
screen
,
and
did
not
look
,
and
,
as
she
said
,
she
tried
not
to
make
the
noise
very
offensive
;
but
now
that
she
was
left
alone
,
she
seemed
quite
horrified
when
I
begged
her
to
remain
with
me
in
the
warm
dining
-
parlour
,
and
enjoy
her
orange
as
she
liked
best
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
it
was
in
everything
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
's
rules
were
made
more
stringent
than
ever
,
because
the
framer
of
them
was
gone
where
there
could
be
no
appeal
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
things
else
<EOS>
Miss
Matilda
was
meek
and
undecided
to
a
fault
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
heard
Fanny
turn
her
round
twenty
times
in
a
morning
about
dinner
,
just
as
the
little
hussy
chose
;
and
I
sometimes
fancied
she
worked
on
Miss
Matilda
's
weakness
in
order
to
bewilder
her
,
and
to
make
her
feel
more
in
the
power
of
her
clever
servant
.
 
<EOS>
I
determined
that
I
would
not
leave
her
till
I
had
seen
what
sort
of
a
person
Martha
was
;
and
,
if
I
found
her
trustworthy
,
I
would
tell
her
not
to
trouble
her
mistress
with
every
little
decision
.
  
<EOS>
Martha
was
blunt
and
plain
-
spoken
to
a
fault
;
otherwise
she
was
a
brisk
,
well
-
meaning
,
but
very
ignorant
girl
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
not
been
with
us
a
week
before
Miss
Matilda
<EOS>
and
I
were
astounded
one
morning
by
the
receipt
of
a
letter
from
a
cousin
of
hers
,
who
had
been
twenty
or
thirty
years
in
India
,
and
who
had
lately
,
as
we
had
seen
by
the
"
Army
List
,
"
returned
to
England
,
bringing
with
him
an
invalid
wife
who
had
never
been
introduced
to
her
English
relations
.
 
<EOS>
Major
Jenkyns
wrote
to
propose
that
he
and
his
wife
should
spend
a
night
at
Cranford
,
on
his
way
to
Scotland
 
at
the
inn
,
if
it
did
not
suit
Miss
Matilda
to
receive
them
into
her
house
;
in
which
case
they
should
hope
to
be
with
her
as
much
as
possible
during
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
it
MUST
suit
her
,
as
she
said
;
for
all
Cranford
knew
that
she
had
her
sister
's
bedroom
at
liberty
;
but
I
am
sure
she
wished
the
Major
had
stopped
in
India
and
forgotten
his
cousins
out
and
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
must
I
manage
?
"
<EOS>
asked
she
helplessly
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
Deborah
had
been
alive
she
would
have
known
what
to
do
with
a
gentleman
-
visitor
.
<EOS>
Must
I
put
razors
in
his
dressing
-
room
?
 
<EOS>
Dear
!
<EOS>
dear
!
<EOS>
and
I
've
got
none
.
 
<EOS>
Deborah
would
have
had
them
.
 
<EOS>
And
slippers
,
and
coat
-
brushes
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
suggested
that
probably
he
would
bring
all
these
things
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
after
dinner
,
how
am
I
to
know
when
to
get
up
and
leave
him
to
his
wine
?
 
<EOS>
Deborah
would
have
done
it
so
well
;
she
would
have
been
quite
in
her
element
.
 
<EOS>
Will
he
want
coffee
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
undertook
the
management
of
the
coffee
,
and
told
her
I
would
instruct
Martha
in
the
art
of
waiting
 
in
which
it
must
be
owned
<EOS>
she
was
terribly
deficient
 
and
that
I
had
no
doubt
Major
and
Mrs
Jenkyns
would
understand
the
quiet
mode
in
which
a
lady
lived
by
herself
in
a
country
town
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
was
sadly
fluttered
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
her
empty
her
decanters
and
bring
up
two
fresh
bottles
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
I
wished
I
could
have
prevented
her
from
being
present
at
my
instructions
to
Martha
,
for
she
frequently
cut
in
with
some
fresh
direction
,
muddling
the
poor
girl
's
mind
as
she
stood
open
-
mouthed
,
listening
to
us
both
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hand
the
vegetables
round
,
"
said
I
(
foolishly
,
I
see
now
 
for
it
was
aiming
at
more
than
we
could
accomplish
with
quietness
and
simplicity
)
;
and
then
,
seeing
her
look
bewildered
,
I
added
,
"
take
the
vegetables
round
to
people
,
and
let
them
help
themselves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
mind
you
go
first
to
the
ladies
,
"
put
in
Miss
Matilda
.
<EOS>
"
Always
go
to
the
ladies
before
gentlemen
when
you
are
waiting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
do
it
as
you
tell
me
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Martha
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
like
lads
best
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
felt
very
uncomfortable
and
shocked
at
this
speech
of
Martha
's
,
yet
I
do
n't
think
she
meant
any
harm
;
and
,
on
the
whole
,
she
attended
very
well
to
our
directions
,
except
that
she
"
nudged
"
the
Major
when
he
did
not
help
himself
as
soon
as
she
expected
to
the
potatoes
,
while
she
was
handing
them
round
.
  
<EOS>
The
major
and
his
wife
were
quiet
unpretending
people
enough
when
they
did
come
;
languid
,
as
all
East
Indians
are
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
rather
dismayed
at
their
bringing
two
servants
with
them
,
a
Hindoo
body
-
servant
for
the
Major
,
and
a
steady
elderly
maid
for
his
wife
;
but
they
slept
at
the
inn
,
and
took
off
a
good
deal
of
the
responsibility
by
attending
carefully
to
their
master
's
and
mistress
's
comfort
.
 
<EOS>
Martha
,
to
be
sure
,
had
never
ended
her
staring
at
the
East
Indian
's
white
turban
and
brown
complexion
,
and
I
saw
that
Miss
Matilda
shrunk
away
from
him
a
little
as
he
waited
at
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
she
asked
me
,
when
they
were
gone
,
if
he
did
not
remind
me
of
Blue
Beard
?
 
<EOS>
On
the
whole
,
the
visit
was
most
satisfactory
,
and
is
a
subject
of
conversation
even
now
with
Miss
Matilda
;
at
the
time
it
greatly
excited
Cranford
,
and
even
stirred
up
the
apathetic
and
Honourable
Mrs
Jamieson
to
some
expression
of
interest
,
when
I
went
to
call
and
thank
her
for
the
kind
answers
she
had
vouchsafed
to
Miss
Matilda
's
inquiries
as
to
the
arrangement
of
a
gentleman
's
dressing
-
room
 
answers
which
I
must
confess
she
had
given
in
the
wearied
manner
of
the
Scandinavian
prophetess
     
"
Leave
me
,
leave
me
to
repose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
NOW
I
come
to
the
love
affair
.
  
<EOS>
It
seems
that
Miss
Pole
had
a
cousin
,
once
or
twice
removed
,
who
had
offered
to
Miss
Matty
long
ago
.
 
<EOS>
Now
this
cousin
lived
four
or
five
miles
from
Cranford
on
his
own
estate
;
but
his
property
was
not
large
enough
to
entitle
him
to
rank
higher
than
a
yeoman
;
or
rather
,
with
something
of
the
"
pride
which
apes
humility
,
"
he
had
refused
to
push
himself
on
,
as
so
many
of
his
class
had
done
,
into
the
ranks
of
the
squires
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
called
Thomas
Holbrook
,
ESQ
.
<EOS>
;
he
even
sent
back
letters
with
this
address
,
telling
the
post
-
mistress
at
Cranford
that
his
name
was
MR
Thomas
Holbrook
,
yeoman
.
 
<EOS>
He
rejected
all
domestic
innovations
;
he
would
have
the
house
door
stand
open
in
summer
and
shut
in
winter
,
without
knocker
or
bell
to
summon
a
servant
.
 
<EOS>
The
closed
fist
or
the
knob
of
a
stick
did
this
office
for
him
if
he
found
the
door
locked
.
 
<EOS>
He
despised
every
refinement
which
had
not
its
root
deep
down
in
humanity
.
 
<EOS>
If
people
were
not
ill
,
he
saw
no
necessity
for
moderating
his
voice
.
 
<EOS>
He
spoke
the
dialect
of
the
country
in
perfection
,
and
constantly
used
it
in
conversation
;
although
Miss
Pole
(
who
gave
me
these
particulars
)
added
,
that
he
read
aloud
more
beautifully
and
with
more
feeling
than
any
one
she
had
ever
heard
,
except
the
late
rector
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
came
Miss
Matilda
not
to
marry
him
?
"
asked
I.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
willing
enough
,
I
think
;
but
you
know
Cousin
Thomas
would
not
have
been
enough
of
a
gentleman
for
the
rector
and
Miss
Jenkyns
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
but
they
were
not
to
marry
him
,
"
said
I
,
impatiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
but
they
did
not
like
Miss
Matty
to
marry
below
her
rank
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
she
was
the
rector
's
daughter
,
and
somehow
they
are
related
to
Sir
Peter
Arley
:
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
thought
a
deal
of
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Miss
Matty
!
"
said
I.
  
"
Nay
,
now
,
I
do
n't
know
anything
more
than
that
he
offered
and
was
refused
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
might
not
like
him
 
and
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
might
never
have
said
a
word
 
<EOS>
it
is
only
a
guess
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Has
she
never
seen
him
since
?
"
I
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
think
not
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
Woodley
,
Cousin
Thomas
's
house
,
lies
half
-
way
between
Cranford
and
Misselton
;
and
I
know
he
made
Misselton
his
market
-
town
very
soon
after
he
had
offered
to
Miss
Matty
;
and
I
do
n't
think
he
has
been
into
Cranford
above
once
or
twice
since
 
once
,
when
I
was
walking
with
Miss
Matty
,
in
High
Street
,
and
suddenly
she
darted
from
me
,
and
went
up
Shire
Lane
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
after
I
was
startled
by
meeting
Cousin
Thomas
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
old
is
he
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
after
a
pause
of
castle
-
building
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
must
be
about
seventy
,
I
think
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Miss
Pole
,
blowing
up
my
castle
,
as
if
by
gun
-
powder
,
into
small
fragments
.
  
<EOS>
Very
soon
after
 
at
least
during
my
long
visit
to
Miss
Matilda
 
<EOS>
I
had
the
opportunity
of
seeing
Mr
Holbrook
;
seeing
,
too
,
his
first
encounter
with
his
former
love
,
after
thirty
or
forty
years
'
separation
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
helping
to
decide
whether
any
of
the
new
assortment
of
coloured
silks
which
they
had
just
received
at
the
shop
would
do
to
match
a
grey
and
black
mousseline
-
delaine
that
wanted
a
new
breadth
,
when
a
tall
,
thin
,
Don
Quixote
-
looking
old
man
came
into
the
shop
for
some
woollen
gloves
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
never
seen
the
person
(
who
was
rather
striking
)
before
,
and
I
watched
him
rather
attentively
while
Miss
Matty
listened
to
the
shopman
.
 
<EOS>
The
stranger
wore
a
blue
coat
with
brass
buttons
,
drab
breeches
,
and
gaiters
,
and
drummed
with
his
fingers
on
the
counter
until
he
was
attended
to
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
answered
the
shop
-
boy
's
question
,
"
What
can
I
have
the
pleasure
of
showing
you
to
-
day
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
saw
Miss
Matilda
start
,
and
then
suddenly
sit
down
;
and
instantly
I
guessed
who
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
made
some
inquiry
which
had
to
be
carried
round
to
the
other
shopman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Jenkyns
wants
the
black
sarsenet
two
-
and
-
twopence
the
yard
"
;
and
Mr
Holbrook
had
caught
the
name
,
and
was
across
the
shop
in
two
strides
.
  
<EOS>
"
Matty
 
Miss
Matilda
 
Miss
Jenkyns
!
 
<EOS>
God
bless
my
soul
!
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
known
you
.
 
<EOS>
How
are
you
?
<EOS>
how
are
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
kept
shaking
her
hand
in
a
way
which
proved
the
warmth
of
his
friendship
;
but
he
repeated
so
often
,
as
if
to
himself
,
"
I
should
not
have
known
you
!
"
<EOS>
that
any
sentimental
romance
which
I
might
be
inclined
to
build
was
quite
done
away
with
by
his
manner
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
he
kept
talking
to
us
all
the
time
we
were
in
the
shop
;
and
then
waving
the
shopman
with
the
unpurchased
gloves
on
one
side
,
with
"
Another
time
,
sir
!
<EOS>
another
time
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
walked
home
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
happy
to
say
my
client
,
Miss
Matilda
,
also
left
the
shop
in
an
equally
bewildered
state
,
not
having
purchased
either
green
or
red
silk
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Holbrook
was
evidently
full
with
honest
loud
-
spoken
joy
at
meeting
his
old
love
again
;
he
touched
on
the
changes
that
had
taken
place
;
he
even
spoke
of
Miss
Jenkyns
as
"
Your
poor
sister
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
well
!
<EOS>
we
have
all
our
faults
"
;
and
bade
us
good
-
bye
with
many
a
hope
that
he
should
soon
see
Miss
Matty
again
.
 
<EOS>
She
went
straight
to
her
room
,
and
never
came
back
till
our
early
tea
-
time
,
when
I
thought
she
looked
as
if
she
had
been
crying
.
   
<EOS>
A
VISIT
TO
AN
OLD
BACHELOR
 
<EOS>
A
few
days
after
,
a
note
came
from
Mr
Holbrook
,
asking
us
 
impartially
asking
both
of
us
 
in
a
formal
,
old
-
fashioned
style
,
to
spend
a
day
at
his
house
 
a
long
June
day
 
for
it
was
June
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
named
that
he
had
also
invited
his
cousin
,
Miss
Pole
;
so
that
we
might
join
in
a
fly
,
which
could
be
put
up
at
his
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
expected
Miss
Matty
to
jump
at
this
invitation
;
but
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
<EOS>
and
I
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
persuading
her
to
go
.
<EOS>
She
thought
it
was
improper
;
and
was
even
half
annoyed
when
we
utterly
ignored
the
idea
of
any
impropriety
in
her
going
with
two
other
ladies
to
see
her
old
lover
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
a
more
serious
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
think
Deborah
would
have
liked
her
to
go
.
<EOS>
This
took
us
half
a
day
's
good
hard
talking
to
get
over
;
but
,
at
the
first
sentence
of
relenting
,
I
seized
the
opportunity
,
and
wrote
and
despatched
an
acceptance
in
her
name
 
fixing
day
and
hour
,
that
all
might
be
decided
and
done
with
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
she
asked
me
if
I
would
go
down
to
the
shop
with
her
;
and
there
,
after
much
hesitation
,
we
chose
out
three
caps
to
be
sent
home
and
tried
on
,
that
the
most
becoming
might
be
selected
to
take
with
us
on
Thursday
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
in
a
state
of
silent
agitation
all
the
way
to
Woodley
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
evidently
never
been
there
before
;
and
,
although
she
little
dreamt
<EOS>
I
knew
anything
of
her
early
story
,
I
could
perceive
she
was
in
a
tremor
at
the
thought
of
seeing
the
place
which
might
have
been
her
home
,
and
round
which
it
is
probable
that
many
of
her
innocent
girlish
imaginations
had
clustered
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
long
drive
there
,
through
paved
jolting
lanes
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matilda
sat
bolt
upright
,
and
looked
wistfully
out
of
the
windows
as
we
drew
near
the
end
of
our
journey
.
 
<EOS>
The
aspect
of
the
country
was
quiet
and
pastoral
.
<EOS>
Woodley
stood
among
fields
;
and
there
was
an
old
-
fashioned
garden
where
roses
and
currant
-
bushes
touched
each
other
,
and
where
the
feathery
asparagus
formed
a
pretty
background
to
the
pinks
and
gilly
-
flowers
;
there
was
no
drive
up
to
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
We
got
out
at
a
little
gate
,
and
walked
up
a
straight
box
-
edged
path
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
cousin
might
make
a
drive
,
I
think
,
"
said
Miss
Pole
,
who
was
afraid
of
ear
-
ache
,
and
had
only
her
cap
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
is
very
pretty
,
"
said
Miss
Matty
,
with
a
soft
plaintiveness
in
her
voice
,
and
almost
in
a
whisper
,
for
<EOS>
just
then
Mr
Holbrook
appeared
at
the
door
,
rubbing
his
hands
in
very
effervescence
of
hospitality
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
more
like
my
idea
of
Don
Quixote
than
ever
,
and
yet
the
likeness
was
only
external
.
 
<EOS>
His
respectable
housekeeper
stood
modestly
at
the
door
to
bid
us
welcome
;
and
,
while
she
led
the
elder
ladies
upstairs
to
a
bedroom
,
I
begged
to
look
about
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
My
request
evidently
pleased
the
old
gentleman
,
who
took
me
all
round
the
place
and
showed
me
his
six
-
and
-
twenty
cows
,
named
after
the
different
letters
of
the
alphabet
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
went
along
,
he
surprised
me
occasionally
by
repeating
apt
and
beautiful
quotations
from
the
poets
,
ranging
easily
from
Shakespeare
and
George
Herbert
to
those
of
our
own
day
.
<EOS>
He
did
this
as
naturally
as
if
he
were
thinking
aloud
,
and
their
true
and
beautiful
words
were
the
best
expression
he
could
find
for
what
he
was
thinking
or
feeling
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
he
called
Byron
"
my
Lord
Byrron
,
"
and
pronounced
the
name
of
Goethe
strictly
in
accordance
with
the
English
sound
of
the
letters
 
<EOS>
"
As
Goethe
says
,
"
Ye
ever
-
verdant
palaces
,
"
&
c.
 
Altogether
,
I
never
met
with
a
man
,
before
or
since
,
who
had
spent
so
long
a
life
in
a
secluded
and
not
impressive
country
,
with
ever
-
increasing
delight
in
the
daily
and
yearly
change
of
season
and
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
and
I
went
in
,
we
found
that
dinner
was
nearly
ready
in
the
kitchen
 
<EOS>
for
<EOS>
so
I
suppose
the
room
ought
to
be
called
,
as
there
were
oak
dressers
and
cupboards
all
round
,
all
over
by
the
side
of
the
fireplace
,
and
only
a
small
Turkey
carpet
in
the
middle
of
the
flag
-
floor
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
might
have
been
easily
made
into
a
handsome
dark
oak
dining
-
parlour
by
removing
the
oven
and
a
few
other
appurtenances
of
a
kitchen
,
which
were
evidently
never
used
,
the
real
cooking
-
place
being
at
some
distance
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
in
which
we
were
expected
to
sit
was
a
stiffly
-
furnished
,
ugly
apartment
;
but
that
in
which
we
did
sit
was
what
Mr
Holbrook
called
the
counting
-
house
,
where
he
paid
his
labourers
their
weekly
wages
at
a
great
desk
near
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
pretty
sitting
-
room
 
looking
into
the
orchard
,
and
all
covered
over
with
dancing
tree
-
shadows
 
was
filled
with
books
.
 
<EOS>
They
lay
on
the
ground
,
they
covered
the
walls
,
they
strewed
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
evidently
half
ashamed
and
half
proud
of
his
extravagance
in
this
respect
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
of
all
kinds
 
poetry
and
wild
weird
tales
prevailing
.
 
<EOS>
He
evidently
chose
his
books
in
accordance
with
his
own
tastes
,
not
because
such
and
such
were
classical
or
established
favourites
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
"
we
farmers
ought
not
to
have
much
time
for
reading
;
yet
somehow
one
ca
n't
help
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
pretty
room
!
"
said
Miss
Matty
,
sotto
voce
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
pleasant
place
!
<EOS>
"
said
I
,
aloud
,
almost
simultaneously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
!
<EOS>
if
you
like
it
,
"
replied
he
;
"
but
can
you
sit
on
these
great
,
black
leather
,
three
-
cornered
chairs
?
 
<EOS>
I
like
it
better
than
the
best
parlour
;
but
I
thought
ladies
would
take
that
for
the
smarter
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
smarter
place
,
but
,
like
most
smart
things
,
not
at
all
pretty
,
or
pleasant
,
or
home
-
like
;
so
,
while
we
were
at
dinner
,
the
servant
-
girl
dusted
and
scrubbed
the
counting
-
house
chairs
,
and
we
sat
there
all
the
rest
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
pudding
before
meat
;
and
I
thought
Mr
Holbrook
was
going
to
make
some
apology
for
his
old
-
fashioned
ways
,
for
he
began
     
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
like
newfangled
ways
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
not
at
all
!
"
said
Miss
Matty
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
more
do
I
,
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
house
-
keeper
WILL
have
these
in
her
new
fashion
;
or
else
I
tell
her
that
,
when
I
was
a
young
man
,
we
used
to
keep
strictly
to
my
father
's
rule
,
"
No
broth
,
no
ball
;
no
ball
,
no
beef
"
;
and
always
began
dinner
with
broth
.
 
<EOS>
Then
we
had
suet
puddings
,
boiled
in
the
broth
with
the
beef
:
 
and
then
the
meat
itself
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
did
not
sup
our
broth
,
we
had
no
ball
,
which
we
liked
a
deal
better
;
and
the
beef
came
last
of
all
,
and
only
those
had
it
who
had
done
justice
to
the
broth
and
the
ball
.
 
<EOS>
Now
folks
begin
with
sweet
things
,
and
turn
their
dinners
topsy
-
turvy
.
"
  
<EOS>
When
the
ducks
and
green
peas
came
,
we
looked
at
each
other
in
dismay
;
we
had
only
two
-
pronged
,
black
-
handled
forks
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
true
the
steel
was
as
bright
as
silver
;
but
what
were
we
to
do
?
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
picked
up
her
peas
,
one
by
one
,
on
the
point
of
the
prongs
,
much
as
Amine
ate
her
grains
of
rice
after
her
previous
feast
with
the
Ghoul
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
sighed
over
her
delicate
young
peas
as
she
left
them
on
one
side
of
her
plate
untasted
,
for
they
WOULD
drop
between
the
prongs
.
 
<EOS>
I
looked
at
my
host
:
 
<EOS>
the
peas
were
going
wholesale
into
his
capacious
mouth
,
shovelled
up
by
his
large
round
-
ended
knife
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
,
I
imitated
,
I
survived
!
 
<EOS>
My
friends
,
in
spite
of
my
precedent
,
could
not
muster
up
courage
enough
to
do
an
ungenteel
thing
;
and
,
if
Mr
Holbrook
had
not
been
so
heartily
hungry
,
he
would
probably
have
seen
that
the
good
peas
went
away
almost
untouched
.
  
<EOS>
After
dinner
,
a
clay
pipe
was
brought
in
,
and
a
spittoon
;
and
,
asking
us
to
retire
to
another
room
,
where
he
would
soon
join
us
,
if
we
disliked
tobacco
-
smoke
,
he
presented
his
pipe
to
Miss
Matty
,
and
requested
her
to
fill
the
bowl
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
a
compliment
to
a
lady
in
his
youth
;
but
it
was
rather
inappropriate
to
propose
it
as
an
honour
to
Miss
Matty
,
who
had
been
trained
by
her
sister
to
hold
smoking
of
every
kind
in
utter
abhorrence
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
it
was
a
shock
to
her
refinement
,
it
was
also
a
gratification
to
her
feelings
to
be
thus
selected
;
so
she
daintily
stuffed
the
strong
tobacco
into
the
pipe
,
and
then
we
withdrew
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
pleasant
dining
with
a
bachelor
,
"
said
Miss
Matty
softly
,
as
we
settled
ourselves
in
the
counting
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
only
hope
it
is
not
improper
;
so
many
pleasant
things
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
number
of
books
he
has
!
"
said
Miss
Pole
,
looking
round
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
how
dusty
they
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
must
be
like
one
of
the
great
Dr
Johnson
's
rooms
,
"
said
Miss
Matty
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
superior
man
your
cousin
must
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
!
"
said
Miss
Pole
,
"
he
's
a
great
reader
;
but
I
am
afraid
he
has
got
into
very
uncouth
habits
with
living
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
uncouth
is
too
hard
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
call
him
eccentric
;
very
clever
people
always
are
!
"
replied
Miss
Matty
.
  
<EOS>
When
Mr
Holbrook
returned
,
he
proposed
a
walk
in
the
fields
;
but
the
two
elder
ladies
were
afraid
of
damp
,
and
dirt
,
and
had
only
very
unbecoming
calashes
to
put
on
over
their
caps
;
so
they
declined
,
and
I
was
again
his
companion
in
a
turn
which
he
said
he
was
obliged
to
take
to
see
after
his
men
.
 
<EOS>
He
strode
along
,
either
wholly
forgetting
my
existence
,
or
soothed
into
silence
by
his
pipe
 
<EOS>
and
yet
it
was
not
silence
exactly
.
 
<EOS>
He
walked
before
me
with
a
stooping
gait
,
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
;
and
,
as
some
tree
or
cloud
,
or
glimpse
of
distant
upland
pastures
,
struck
him
,
he
quoted
poetry
to
himself
,
saying
it
out
loud
in
a
grand
sonorous
voice
,
with
just
the
emphasis
that
true
feeling
and
appreciation
give
.
 
<EOS>
We
came
upon
an
old
cedar
tree
,
which
stood
at
one
end
of
the
house
     
<EOS>
"
The
cedar
spreads
his
dark
-
green
layers
of
shade
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Capital
term
"
layers
!
"
 
<EOS>
Wonderful
man
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
whether
he
was
speaking
to
me
or
not
;
but
I
put
in
an
assenting
"
wonderful
,
"
although
I
knew
nothing
about
it
,
just
because
I
was
tired
of
being
forgotten
,
and
of
being
consequently
silent
.
  
<EOS>
He
turned
sharp
round
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
you
may
say
"
wonderful
.
"
 
<EOS>
Why
,
when
I
saw
the
review
of
his
poems
in
Blackwood
,
I
set
off
within
an
hour
,
and
walked
seven
miles
to
Misselton
(
for
the
horses
were
not
in
the
way
)
and
ordered
them
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
what
colour
are
ash
-
buds
in
March
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Is
the
man
going
mad
?
<EOS>
thought
<EOS>
I.
 
He
is
very
like
Don
Quixote
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
colour
are
they
,
I
say
?
"
repeated
he
vehemently
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
know
,
sir
,
"
said
I
,
with
the
meekness
of
ignorance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
you
did
n't
.
 
<EOS>
No
more
did
I
 
an
old
fool
<EOS>
that
I
am
!
 
<EOS>
till
this
young
man
comes
and
tells
me
.
 
<EOS>
Black
as
ash
-
buds
in
March
.
<EOS>
And
I
've
lived
all
my
life
in
the
country
;
more
shame
for
me
not
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
Black
:
 
<EOS>
they
are
jet
-
black
,
madam
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
went
off
again
,
swinging
along
to
the
music
of
some
rhyme
he
had
got
hold
of
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
came
back
,
nothing
would
serve
him
but
he
must
read
us
the
poems
he
had
been
speaking
of
;
and
Miss
Pole
encouraged
him
in
his
proposal
,
I
thought
,
because
she
wished
me
to
hear
his
beautiful
reading
,
of
which
she
had
boasted
;
but
she
afterwards
said
it
was
because
she
had
got
to
a
difficult
part
of
her
crochet
,
and
wanted
to
count
her
stitches
without
having
to
talk
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
he
had
proposed
would
have
been
right
to
Miss
Matty
;
although
she
did
fall
sound
asleep
within
five
minutes
after
he
had
begun
a
long
poem
,
called
"
Locksley
Hall
,
"
and
had
a
comfortable
nap
,
unobserved
,
till
he
ended
;
when
the
cessation
of
his
voice
wakened
her
up
,
and
she
said
,
feeling
that
something
was
expected
,
and
that
Miss
Pole
was
counting
     
<EOS>
"
What
a
pretty
book
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pretty
,
madam
!
<EOS>
it
's
beautiful
!
 
<EOS>
Pretty
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
!
 
<EOS>
I
meant
beautiful
"
said
she
,
fluttered
at
his
disapproval
of
her
word
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
like
that
beautiful
poem
of
Dr
Johnson
's
my
sister
used
to
read
 
<EOS>
I
forget
the
name
of
it
<EOS>
;
what
was
it
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
turning
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Which
do
you
mean
,
ma'am
?
 
<EOS>
What
was
it
about
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
remember
what
it
was
about
,
and
I
've
quite
forgotten
what
the
name
of
it
was
;
but
it
was
written
by
Dr
Johnson
,
and
was
very
beautiful
,
and
very
like
what
Mr
Holbrook
has
just
been
reading
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
remember
it
,
"
said
he
reflectively
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
know
Dr
Johnson
's
poems
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
read
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
we
were
getting
into
the
fly
to
return
,
I
heard
Mr
Holbrook
say
he
should
call
on
the
ladies
soon
,
and
inquire
how
they
got
home
;
and
this
evidently
pleased
and
fluttered
Miss
Matty
at
the
time
he
said
it
;
but
after
we
had
lost
sight
of
the
old
house
among
the
trees
<EOS>
her
sentiments
towards
the
master
of
it
were
gradually
absorbed
into
a
distressing
wonder
as
to
whether
Martha
had
broken
her
word
,
and
seized
on
the
opportunity
of
her
mistress
's
absence
to
have
a
"
follower
.
"
 
<EOS>
Martha
looked
good
,
and
steady
,
and
composed
enough
,
as
she
came
to
help
us
out
;
she
was
always
careful
of
Miss
Matty
,
and
to
-
night
she
made
use
of
this
unlucky
speech
     
"
Eh
!
<EOS>
dear
ma'am
,
to
think
of
your
going
out
in
an
evening
in
such
a
thin
shawl
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
no
better
than
muslin
.
 
<EOS>
At
your
age
,
ma'am
,
you
should
be
careful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
age
!
"
said
Miss
Matty
,
almost
speaking
crossly
,
for
her
,
for
she
was
usually
gentle
 
<EOS>
"
My
age
!
 
<EOS>
Why
,
how
old
do
you
think
I
am
,
that
you
talk
about
my
age
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ma'am
,
I
should
say
you
were
not
far
short
of
sixty
:
 
<EOS>
but
folks
'
looks
is
often
against
them
 
<EOS>
and
I
'm
sure
I
meant
no
harm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Martha
,
I
'm
not
yet
fifty
-
two
!
"
said
Miss
Matty
,
with
grave
emphasis
;
for
probably
the
remembrance
of
her
youth
had
come
very
vividly
before
her
this
day
,
and
she
was
annoyed
at
finding
that
golden
time
so
far
away
in
the
past
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
never
spoke
of
any
former
and
more
intimate
acquaintance
with
Mr
Holbrook
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
probably
met
with
so
little
sympathy
in
her
early
love
,
that
she
had
shut
it
up
close
in
her
heart
;
and
it
was
only
by
a
sort
of
watching
,
which
I
could
hardly
avoid
since
Miss
Pole
's
confidence
,
that
I
saw
how
faithful
her
poor
heart
had
been
in
its
sorrow
and
its
silence
.
  
<EOS>
She
gave
me
some
good
reason
for
wearing
her
best
cap
every
day
,
and
sat
near
the
window
,
in
spite
of
her
rheumatism
,
in
order
to
see
,
without
being
seen
,
down
into
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
He
came
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
his
open
palms
upon
his
knees
,
which
were
far
apart
,
as
he
sat
with
his
head
bent
down
,
whistling
,
after
we
had
replied
to
his
inquiries
about
our
safe
return
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
jumped
up
     
"
Well
,
madam
!
<EOS>
have
you
any
commands
for
Paris
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
going
there
in
a
week
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
Paris
!
<EOS>
"
we
both
exclaimed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
madam
!
 
<EOS>
I
've
never
been
there
,
and
always
had
a
wish
to
go
;
and
I
think
if
I
do
n't
go
soon
,
I
may
n't
go
at
all
;
so
as
soon
as
the
hay
is
got
in
I
shall
go
,
before
harvest
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
were
so
much
astonished
that
we
had
no
commissions
.
  
<EOS>
Just
as
he
was
going
out
of
the
room
,
he
turned
back
,
with
his
favourite
exclamation
     
<EOS>
"
God
bless
my
soul
,
madam
!
<EOS>
but
I
nearly
forgot
half
my
errand
.
<EOS>
Here
are
the
poems
for
you
you
admired
so
much
the
other
evening
at
my
house
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
tugged
away
at
a
parcel
in
his
coat
-
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
miss
,
"
said
he
;
"
good
-
bye
,
Matty
!
<EOS>
take
care
of
yourself
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
had
given
her
a
book
,
and
he
had
called
her
Matty
,
just
as
he
used
to
do
thirty
years
to
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
would
not
go
to
Paris
,
"
said
Miss
Matilda
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
frogs
will
agree
with
him
;
he
used
to
have
to
be
very
careful
what
he
ate
,
which
was
curious
in
so
strong
-
looking
a
young
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
I
took
my
leave
,
giving
many
an
injunction
to
Martha
to
look
after
her
mistress
,
and
to
let
me
know
if
she
thought
that
Miss
Matilda
was
not
so
well
;
in
which
case
I
would
volunteer
a
visit
to
my
old
friend
,
without
noticing
Martha
's
intelligence
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
Accordingly
I
received
a
line
or
two
from
Martha
every
now
and
then
;
and
,
about
November
I
had
a
note
to
say
her
mistress
was
"
very
low
and
sadly
off
her
food
"
;
and
the
account
made
me
so
uneasy
that
,
although
Martha
did
not
decidedly
summon
me
,
I
packed
up
my
things
and
went
.
  
<EOS>
I
received
a
warm
welcome
,
in
spite
of
the
little
flurry
produced
by
my
impromptu
visit
,
for
I
had
only
been
able
to
give
a
day
's
notice
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matilda
looked
miserably
ill
;
and
I
prepared
to
comfort
and
cosset
her
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
down
to
have
a
private
talk
with
Martha
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
has
your
mistress
been
so
poorly
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
as
I
stood
by
the
kitchen
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
its
better
than
a
fortnight
;
it
is
,
I
know
;
<EOS>
it
was
one
Tuesday
,
after
Miss
Pole
had
been
,
that
she
went
into
this
moping
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
she
was
tired
,
and
it
would
go
off
with
a
night
's
rest
;
but
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
she
has
gone
on
and
on
ever
since
,
till
I
thought
it
my
duty
to
write
to
you
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
quite
right
,
Martha
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
comfort
to
think
she
has
so
faithful
a
servant
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
hope
you
find
your
place
comfortable
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ma'am
,
missus
is
very
kind
,
and
there
's
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
,
and
no
more
work
<EOS>
but
what
I
can
do
easily
 
but
"
Martha
hesitated
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
what
,
Martha
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
seems
so
hard
of
missus
not
to
let
me
have
any
followers
;
there
's
such
lots
of
young
fellows
in
the
town
;
and
many
a
one
has
as
much
as
offered
to
keep
company
with
me
;
and
I
may
never
be
in
such
a
likely
place
again
,
and
it
's
like
wasting
an
opportunity
.
<EOS>
Many
a
girl
as
I
know
would
have
'em
unbeknownst
to
missus
;
but
<EOS>
I
've
given
my
word
,
and
I
'll
stick
to
it
;
or
else
this
is
just
the
house
for
missus
never
to
be
the
wiser
if
they
did
come
:
 
and
<EOS>
it
's
such
a
capable
kitchen
 
<EOS>
there
's
such
dark
corners
in
it
 
<EOS>
I
'd
be
bound
to
hide
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
counted
up
last
Sunday
night
 
for
I
'll
not
deny
I
was
crying
because
I
had
to
shut
the
door
in
Jem
Hearn
's
face
,
and
he
's
a
steady
young
man
,
fit
for
any
girl
;
only
I
had
given
missus
my
word
.
"
 
<EOS>
Martha
was
all
but
crying
again
;
and
I
had
little
comfort
to
give
her
,
for
I
knew
,
from
old
experience
,
of
the
horror
with
which
both
the
Miss
Jenkynses
looked
upon
"
followers
"
;
and
in
Miss
Matty
's
present
nervous
state
<EOS>
this
dread
was
not
likely
to
be
lessened
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
to
see
Miss
Pole
the
next
day
,
and
took
her
completely
by
surprise
,
for
she
had
not
been
to
see
Miss
Matilda
for
two
days
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
I
must
go
back
with
you
,
my
dear
,
for
I
promised
to
let
her
know
how
Thomas
Holbrook
went
on
;
and
,
I
'm
sorry
to
say
,
his
housekeeper
has
sent
me
word
to
-
day
that
he
has
n't
long
to
live
.
<EOS>
Poor
Thomas
!
<EOS>
that
journey
to
Paris
was
quite
too
much
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
housekeeper
says
he
has
hardly
ever
been
round
his
fields
since
,
but
just
sits
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
in
the
counting
-
house
,
not
reading
or
anything
,
but
only
saying
what
a
wonderful
city
Paris
was
!
 
<EOS>
Paris
has
much
to
answer
for
if
it
's
killed
my
cousin
Thomas
,
for
a
better
man
never
lived
.

Matilda
know
of
his
illness
?
"
<EOS>
asked
I
 
a
new
light
as
to
the
cause
of
her
indisposition
dawning
upon
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
!
to
be
sure
,
yes
!
 
<EOS>
Has
not
she
told
you
?
 
<EOS>
I
let
her
know
a
fortnight
ago
,
or
more
,
when
first
I
heard
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
How
odd
she
should
n't
have
told
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Not
at
all
,
I
thought
;
but
I
did
not
say
anything
.
 
<EOS>
I
felt
almost
guilty
of
having
spied
too
curiously
into
that
tender
heart
,
and
I
was
not
going
to
speak
of
its
secrets
 
<EOS>
hidden
,
Miss
Matty
believed
,
from
all
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
I
ushered
Miss
Pole
into
Miss
Matilda
's
little
drawing
-
room
,
and
then
left
them
alone
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
not
surprised
when
Martha
came
to
my
bedroom
door
,
to
ask
me
to
go
down
to
dinner
alone
,
for
that
missus
<EOS>
had
one
of
her
bad
headaches
.
 
<EOS>
She
came
into
the
drawing
-
room
at
tea
-
time
,
but
it
was
evidently
an
effort
to
her
;
and
,
as
if
to
make
up
for
some
reproachful
feeling
against
her
late
sister
,
Miss
Jenkyns
,
which
had
been
troubling
her
all
the
afternoon
,
and
for
which
she
now
felt
penitent
,
she
kept
telling
me
how
good
and
how
clever
Deborah
was
in
her
youth
<EOS>
;
how
she
used
to
settle
what
gowns
they
were
to
wear
at
all
the
parties
(
faint
,
ghostly
ideas
of
grim
parties
,
far
away
in
the
distance
,
when
Miss
Matty
and
Miss
Pole
were
young
!
)
<EOS>
;
and
how
Deborah
and
her
mother
had
started
the
benefit
society
for
the
poor
,
and
taught
girls
cooking
and
plain
sewing
;
and
how
Deborah
had
once
danced
with
a
lord
;
and
how
she
used
to
visit
at
Sir
Peter
Arley
's
,
and
tried
to
remodel
the
quiet
rectory
establishment
on
the
plans
of
Arley
Hall
,
where
they
kept
thirty
servants
;
and
how
she
had
nursed
Miss
Matty
through
a
long
,
long
illness
,
of
which
I
had
never
heard
before
,
but
which
I
now
dated
in
my
own
mind
as
following
the
dismissal
of
the
suit
of
Mr
Holbrook
.
 
<EOS>
So
we
talked
softly
and
quietly
of
old
times
through
the
long
November
evening
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
Miss
Pole
brought
us
word
that
Mr
Holbrook
was
dead
.
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
heard
the
news
in
silence
;
in
fact
,
from
the
account
of
the
previous
day
,
it
was
only
what
we
had
to
expect
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
kept
calling
upon
us
for
some
expression
of
regret
,
by
asking
if
it
was
not
sad
that
he
was
gone
,
and
saying
     
"
To
think
of
that
pleasant
day
last
June
,
when
he
seemed
so
well
!
<EOS>
And
he
might
have
lived
this
dozen
years
if
he
had
not
gone
to
that
wicked
Paris
,
where
they
are
always
having
revolutions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
paused
for
some
demonstration
on
our
part
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
Miss
Matty
could
not
speak
,
she
was
trembling
so
nervously
;
so
I
said
what
I
really
felt
;
and
after
a
call
of
some
duration
 
all
the
time
of
which
I
have
<EOS>
no
doubt
Miss
Pole
thought
Miss
Matty
received
the
news
very
calmly
 
our
visitor
took
her
leave
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
made
a
strong
effort
to
conceal
her
feelings
 
a
concealment
she
practised
even
with
me
,
for
she
has
never
alluded
to
Mr
Holbrook
again
,
although
the
book
he
gave
her
lies
with
her
Bible
on
the
little
table
by
her
bedside
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
think
I
heard
her
when
she
asked
the
little
milliner
of
Cranford
to
make
her
caps
something
like
the
Honourable
Mrs
Jamieson
's
,
or
that
I
noticed
the
reply
     
<EOS>
"
But
she
wears
widows
'
caps
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
only
meant
something
in
that
style
;
not
widows
'
,
of
course
,
but
rather
like
Mrs
Jamieson
's
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
effort
at
concealment
was
the
beginning
of
the
tremulous
motion
of
head
and
hands
which
I
have
seen
ever
since
in
Miss
Matty
.
  
<EOS>
The
evening
of
the
day
on
which
we
heard
of
Mr
Holbrook
's
death
,
Miss
Matilda
was
very
silent
and
thoughtful
;
after
prayers
she
called
Martha
back
<EOS>
and
then
she
stood
uncertain
what
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
Martha
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
at
last
,
"
you
are
young
"
 
a
nd
<EOS>
then
she
made
so
long
a
pause
that
Martha
,
to
remind
her
of
her
half
-
finished
sentence
,
dropped
a
curtsey
,
and
said
     
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
please
,
ma'am
;
two
-
and
-
twenty
last
third
of
October
,
please
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
,
perhaps
,
Martha
,
you
may
some
time
meet
with
a
young
man
you
like
,
and
who
likes
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
say
you
were
not
to
have
followers
;
but
if
you
meet
with
such
a
young
man
,
and
tell
me
,
and
I
find
he
is
respectable
,
I
have
no
objection
to
his
coming
to
see
you
once
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
God
forbid
!
"
said
she
in
a
low
voice
,
"
that
I
should
grieve
any
young
hearts
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
spoke
as
if
she
were
providing
for
some
distant
contingency
,
and
was
rather
startled
when
Martha
made
her
ready
eager
answer
     
<EOS>
"
Please
,
ma'am
,
there
's
Jem
Hearn
,
and
he
's
a
joiner
making
three-
and
-
sixpence
a
-
day
,
and
six
foot
one
in
his
stocking
-
feet
,
please
,
ma'am
;
and
if
you
'll
ask
about
him
to
-
morrow
morning
,
every
one
will
give
him
a
character
for
steadiness
;
and
he
'll
be
glad
enough
to
come
to
-
morrow
night
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Though
Miss
Matty
was
startled
,
she
submitted
to
Fate
and
Love
.

OLD
LETTERS
 
<EOS>
I
have
often
noticed
that
almost
every
one
has
his
own
individual
small
economies
 
careful
habits
of
saving
fractions
of
pennies
in
some
one
peculiar
direction
 
any
disturbance
of
which
annoys
him
more
than
spending
shillings
or
pounds
on
some
real
extravagance
.
<EOS>
An
old
gentleman
of
my
acquaintance
,
who
took
the
intelligence
of
the
failure
of
a
Joint
-
Stock
Bank
,
in
which
some
of
his
money
was
invested
,
with
stoical
mildness
,
worried
his
family
all
through
a
long
summer
's
day
because
one
of
them
had
torn
(
instead
of
cutting
)
out
the
written
leaves
of
his
now
useless
bank
-
book
;
of
course
,
the
corresponding
pages
at
the
other
end
came
out
as
well
,
and
this
little
unnecessary
waste
of
paper
(
his
private
economy
)
chafed
him
more
than
all
the
loss
of
his
money
.
 
<EOS>
Envelopes
fretted
his
soul
terribly
when
they
first
came
in
;
the
only
way
in
which
he
could
reconcile
himself
to
such
waste
of
his
cherished
article
was
by
patiently
turning
inside
out
all
that
were
sent
to
him
,
and
so
making
them
serve
again
.
 
<EOS>
Even
now
,
though
tamed
by
age
,
I
see
him
casting
wistful
glances
at
his
daughters
when
they
send
a
whole
inside
of
a
half
-
sheet
of
note
paper
,
with
the
three
lines
of
acceptance
to
an
invitation
,
written
on
only
one
of
the
sides
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
above
owning
that
I
have
this
human
weakness
myself
.
 
<EOS>
String
is
my
foible
.
 
<EOS>
My
pockets
get
full
of
little
hanks
of
it
,
picked
up
and
twisted
together
,
ready
for
uses
that
never
come
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
seriously
annoyed
if
any
one
cuts
the
string
of
a
parcel
instead
of
patiently
and
faithfully
undoing
it
fold
by
fold
.
 
<EOS>
How
people
can
bring
themselves
to
use
india
-
rubber
rings
,
which
are
a
sort
of
deification
of
string
,
as
lightly
as
they
do
,
I
can
not
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
To
me
an
india
-
rubber
ring
is
a
precious
treasure
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
one
which
is
not
new
 
one
that
I
picked
up
off
the
floor
nearly
six
years
ago
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
really
tried
to
use
it
,
but
my
heart
failed
me
,
and
I
could
not
commit
the
extravagance
.
  
<EOS>
Small
pieces
of
butter
grieve
others
.
 
<EOS>
They
can
not
attend
to
conversation
because
of
the
annoyance
occasioned
by
the
habit
which
some
people
have
of
invariably
taking
more
butter
than
they
want
.
<EOS>
Have
you
not
seen
the
anxious
look
(
almost
mesmeric
)
which
such
persons
fix
on
the
article
?
 
<EOS>
They
would
feel
it
a
relief
if
they
might
bury
it
out
of
their
sight
by
popping
it
into
their
own
mouths
and
swallowing
it
down
;
and
they
are
really
made
happy
<EOS>
if
the
person
on
whose
plate
it
lies
unused
suddenly
breaks
off
a
piece
of
toast
(
which
he
does
not
want
at
all
)
and
eats
up
his
butter
.
 
<EOS>
They
think
that
this
is
not
waste
.
  
<EOS>
Now
Miss
Matty
Jenkyns
was
chary
of
candles
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
many
devices
to
use
as
few
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
winter
afternoons
she
would
sit
knitting
for
two
or
three
hours
 
<EOS>
she
could
do
this
in
the
dark
,
or
by
firelight
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
asked
if
I
might
not
ring
for
candles
to
finish
stitching
my
wristbands
,
she
told
me
to
"
keep
blind
man
's
holiday
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
were
usually
brought
in
with
tea
;
but
we
only
burnt
one
at
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
As
we
lived
in
constant
preparation
for
a
friend
who
might
come
in
any
evening
(
but
who
never
did
)
,
it
required
some
contrivance
to
keep
our
two
candles
of
the
same
length
,
ready
to
be
lighted
,
and
to
look
as
if
we
burnt
two
always
.
 
<EOS>
The
candles
took
it
in
turns
;
and
,
whatever
we
might
be
talking
about
or
doing
,
Miss
Matty
's
eyes
were
habitually
fixed
upon
the
candle
,
ready
to
jump
up
and
extinguish
it
and
to
light
the
other
before
they
had
become
too
uneven
in
length
to
be
restored
to
equality
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
One
night
,
I
remember
this
candle
economy
particularly
annoyed
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
very
much
tired
of
my
compulsory
"
blind
man
's
holiday
,
"
especially
as
Miss
Matty
had
fallen
asleep
,
and
I
did
not
like
to
stir
the
fire
and
run
the
risk
of
awakening
her
;
so
I
could
not
even
sit
on
the
rug
,
and
scorch
myself
with
sewing
by
firelight
,
according
to
my
usual
custom
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancied
Miss
Matty
must
be
dreaming
of
her
early
life
;
for
she
spoke
one
or
two
words
in
her
uneasy
sleep
bearing
reference
to
persons
who
were
dead
long
before
.
 
<EOS>
When
Martha
brought
in
the
lighted
candle
and
tea
,
Miss
Matty
started
into
wakefulness
,
with
a
strange
,
bewildered
look
around
,
as
if
we
were
not
the
people
she
expected
to
see
about
her
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
sad
expression
that
shadowed
her
face
as
she
recognised
me
;
but
immediately
afterwards
she
tried
to
give
me
her
usual
smile
.
 
<EOS>
All
through
tea
-
time
her
talk
ran
upon
the
days
of
her
childhood
and
youth
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
this
reminded
her
of
the
desirableness
of
looking
over
all
the
old
family
letters
,
and
destroying
such
as
ought
not
to
be
allowed
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
strangers
;
for
she
had
often
spoken
of
the
necessity
of
this
task
,
but
had
always
shrunk
from
it
,
with
a
timid
dread
of
something
painful
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
night
,
however
,
she
rose
up
after
tea
and
went
for
them
 
in
the
dark
;
for
she
piqued
herself
on
the
precise
neatness
of
all
her
chamber
arrangements
,
and
used
to
look
uneasily
at
me
when
I
lighted
a
bed
-
candle
to
go
to
another
room
for
anything
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
returned
there
was
a
faint
,
pleasant
smell
of
Tonquin
beans
in
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
always
noticed
this
scent
about
any
of
the
things
which
had
belonged
to
her
mother
;
and
many
of
the
letters
were
addressed
to
her
 
yellow
bundles
of
love
-
letters
,
sixty
or
seventy
years
old
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
undid
the
packet
with
a
sigh
;
but
she
stifled
it
directly
,
as
if
it
were
hardly
right
to
regret
the
flight
of
time
,
or
of
life
either
.
 
<EOS>
We
agreed
to
look
them
over
separately
,
each
taking
a
different
letter
out
of
the
same
bundle
and
describing
its
contents
to
the
other
before
destroying
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
knew
what
sad
work
the
reading
of
old
-
letters
was
before
that
evening
,
though
I
could
hardly
tell
why
.
 
<EOS>
The
letters
were
as
happy
as
letters
could
be
 
<EOS>
at
least
those
early
letters
were
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
in
them
a
vivid
and
intense
sense
of
the
present
time
,
which
seemed
so
strong
and
full
,
as
if
it
could
never
pass
away
,
and
as
if
the
warm
,
living
hearts
that
so
expressed
themselves
could
never
die
,
and
be
as
nothing
to
the
sunny
earth
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
felt
less
melancholy
,
I
believe
,
if
the
letters
had
been
more
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
the
tears
stealing
down
the
well
-
worn
furrows
of
Miss
Matty
's
cheeks
,
and
her
spectacles
often
wanted
wiping
.
 
<EOS>
I
trusted
at
last
that
she
would
light
the
other
candle
,
for
my
own
eyes
were
rather
dim
,
and
I
wanted
more
light
to
see
the
pale
,
faded
ink
;
<EOS>
but
no
,
even
through
her
tears
,
she
saw
and
remembered
her
little
economical
ways
.
  
<EOS>
The
earliest
set
of
letters
were
two
bundles
tied
together
,
and
ticketed
(
in
Miss
Jenkyns
's
handwriting
)
<EOS>
"
Letters
interchanged
between
my
ever
-
honoured
father
and
my
dearly
-
beloved
mother
,
prior
to
their
marriage
,
in
July
1774
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
should
guess
that
the
rector
of
Cranford
was
about
twenty
-
seven
years
of
age
when
he
wrote
those
letters
;
and
Miss
Matty
told
me
that
her
mother
was
just
eighteen
at
the
time
of
her
wedding
.
 
<EOS>
With
my
idea
of
the
rector
derived
from
a
picture
in
the
dining
-
parlour
,
stiff
and
stately
,
in
a
huge
full
-
bottomed
wig
,
with
gown
,
cassock
,
and
bands
,
and
his
hand
upon
a
copy
of
the
only
sermon
he
ever
published
 
it
was
strange
to
read
these
letters
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
full
of
eager
,
passionate
ardour
;
short
homely
sentences
,
right
fresh
from
the
heart
(
very
different
from
the
grand
Latinised
,
Johnsonian
style
of
the
printed
sermon
preached
before
some
judge
at
assize
time
)
.
 
<EOS>
His
letters
were
a
curious
contrast
to
those
of
his
girl
-
bride
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
evidently
rather
annoyed
at
his
demands
upon
her
for
expressions
of
love
,
and
could
not
quite
understand
what
he
meant
by
repeating
the
same
thing
over
in
so
many
different
ways
;
but
what
she
was
quite
clear
about
was
a
longing
for
a
white
"
Paduasoy
"
 
w
hatever
that
might
be
;
and
six
or
seven
letters
were
principally
occupied
in
asking
her
lover
to
use
his
influence
with
her
parents
(
who
evidently
kept
her
in
good
order
)
to
obtain
this
or
that
article
of
dress
,
more
especially
the
white
"
Paduasoy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
cared
nothing
how
she
was
dressed
;
she
was
always
lovely
enough
for
him
,
as
he
took
pains
to
assure
her
,
when
she
begged
him
to
express
in
his
answers
a
predilection
for
particular
pieces
of
finery
,
in
order
that
she
might
show
what
he
said
to
her
parents
.
 
<EOS>
But
at
length
he
seemed
to
find
out
that
she
would
not
be
married
till
she
had
a
"
trousseau
"
to
her
mind
;
and
then
he
sent
her
a
letter
,
which
had
evidently
accompanied
a
whole
box
full
of
finery
,
and
in
which
he
requested
that
she
might
be
dressed
in
everything
her
heart
desired
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
first
letter
,
ticketed
in
a
frail
,
delicate
hand
,
"
From
my
dearest
John
.
"
 
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
they
were
married
,
I
suppose
,
from
the
intermission
in
their
correspondence
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
burn
them
,
I
think
,
"
said
Miss
Matty
,
looking
doubtfully
at
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
one
will
care
for
them
when
I
am
gone
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
one
by
one
she
dropped
them
into
the
middle
of
the
fire
,
watching
each
blaze
up
,
die
out
,
and
rise
away
,
in
faint
,
white
,
ghostly
semblance
,
up
the
chimney
,
before
she
gave
another
to
the
same
fate
.
 
<EOS>
The
room
was
light
enough
now
;
but
I
,
like
her
,
was
fascinated
into
watching
the
destruction
of
those
letters
,
into
which
the
honest
warmth
of
a
manly
heart
had
been
poured
forth
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
letter
,
likewise
docketed
by
Miss
Jenkyns
,
was
endorsed
,
"
Letter
of
pious
congratulation
and
exhortation
from
my
venerable
grandfather
to
my
beloved
mother
,
on
occasion
of
my
own
birth
.
<EOS>
Also
some
practical
remarks
on
the
desirability
of
keeping
warm
the
extremities
of
infants
,
from
my
excellent
grandmother
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
first
part
was
,
indeed
,
a
severe
and
forcible
picture
of
the
responsibilities
of
mothers
,
and
a
warning
against
the
evils
that
were
in
the
world
,
and
lying
in
<EOS>
ghastly
wait
for
the
little
baby
of
two
days
old
.
 
<EOS>
His
wife
did
not
write
,
said
the
old
gentleman
,
because
he
had
forbidden
it
,
she
being
indisposed
with
a
sprained
ankle
,
which
(
he
said
)
quite
incapacitated
her
from
holding
a
pen
.
<EOS>
However
,
at
the
foot
of
the
page
was
a
small
"
T.O.
,
"
and
on
turning
it
over
,
sure
enough
,
there
was
a
letter
to
"
my
dear
,
dearest
Molly
,
"
begging
her
,
when
she
left
her
room
,
whatever
she
did
,
to
go
UP
stairs
before
going
DOWN
:
 
and
telling
her
to
wrap
her
baby
's
feet
up
in
flannel
,
and
keep
it
warm
by
the
fire
,
although
it
was
summer
,
for
babies
were
so
tender
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
pretty
to
see
from
the
letters
,
which
were
evidently
exchanged
with
some
frequency
between
the
young
mother
and
the
grandmother
,
how
the
girlish
vanity
was
being
weeded
out
of
her
heart
by
love
for
her
baby
.
 
<EOS>
The
white
"
Paduasoy
"
figured
again
in
the
letters
,
with
almost
as
much
vigour
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
,
it
was
being
made
into
a
christening
cloak
for
the
baby
.
 
<EOS>
It
decked
it
when
it
went
with
its
parents
to
spend
a
day
or
two
at
Arley
Hall
.
<EOS>
It
added
to
its
charms
,
when
it
was
"
the
prettiest
little
baby
that
ever
was
seen
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
mother
,
I
wish
you
could
see
her
!
 
<EOS>
Without
any
pershality
,
I
do
think
she
will
grow
up
a
regular
bewty
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
thought
of
Miss
Jenkyns
,
grey
,
withered
,
and
wrinkled
,
and
I
wondered
if
her
mother
had
known
her
in
the
courts
of
heaven
:
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
knew
that
she
had
,
and
that
they
stood
there
in
angelic
guise
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
gap
before
any
of
the
rector
's
letters
appeared
.
<EOS>
And
then
his
wife
had
changed
her
mode
of
her
endorsement
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
no
longer
from
,
"
My
dearest
John
;
"
it
was
from
"
My
Honoured
Husband
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
letters
were
written
on
occasion
of
the
publication
of
the
same
sermon
which
was
represented
in
the
picture
.
 
<EOS>
The
preaching
before
"
My
Lord
Judge
,
"
and
the
"
publishing
by
request
,
"
was
evidently
the
culminating
point
 
<EOS>
the
event
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
been
necessary
for
him
to
go
up
to
London
to
superintend
it
through
the
press
.
 
<EOS>
Many
friends
had
to
be
called
upon
and
consulted
before
he
could
decide
on
any
printer
fit
for
so
onerous
a
task
;
and
at
length
it
was
arranged
that
J.
and
J.
Rivingtons
were
to
have
the
honourable
responsibility
.
 
<EOS>
The
worthy
rector
seemed
to
be
strung
up
by
the
occasion
to
a
high
literary
pitch
,
for
he
could
hardly
write
a
letter
to
his
wife
without
cropping
out
into
Latin
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
the
end
of
one
of
his
letters
ran
thus
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
ever
hold
the
virtuous
qualities
of
my
Molly
in
remembrance
,
dum
memor
ipse
mei
,
dum
spiritus
regit
artus
,
"
which
,
considering
that
the
English
of
his
correspondent
was
sometimes
at
fault
in
grammar
,
and
often
in
spelling
,
might
be
taken
as
a
proof
of
how
much
he
"
idealised
his
Molly
;
"
and
,
as
Miss
Jenkyns
used
to
say
,
"
People
talk
a
great
deal
about
idealising
now
-
a
-
days
,
whatever
that
may
mean
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
But
this
was
nothing
to
a
fit
of
writing
classical
poetry
which
soon
seized
him
,
in
which
his
Molly
figured
away
as
"
Maria
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
letter
containing
the
carmen
was
endorsed
by
her
,
"
Hebrew
verses
sent
me
by
my
honoured
husband
.
 
<EOS>
I
thowt
to
have
had
a
letter
about
killing
the
pig
,
but
must
wait
.
 
<EOS>
Mem
.
,
to
send
the
poetry
to
Sir
Peter
Arley
,
as
my
husband
desires
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
in
a
post
-
scriptum
note
in
his
handwriting
it
was
stated
that
the
Ode
had
appeared
in
the
Gentleman
's
Magazine
,
December
1782
.
  
<EOS>
Her
letters
back
to
her
husband
(
treasured
as
fondly
by
him
as
if
they
had
been
M.
T.
Ciceronis
Epistolae
)
were
more
satisfactory
to
an
absent
husband
and
father
than
his
<EOS>
could
ever
have
been
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
told
him
how
Deborah
sewed
her
seam
very
neatly
every
day
,
and
read
to
her
in
the
books
he
had
set
her
;
how
she
was
a
very
"
forrard
,
"
good
child
,
but
would
ask
questions
her
mother
could
not
answer
,
but
how
she
did
not
let
herself
down
by
saying
she
did
not
know
,
but
took
to
stirring
the
fire
,
or
sending
the
"
forrard
"
child
on
an
errand
.
 
<EOS>
Matty
was
now
the
mother
's
darling
,
and
promised
(
like
her
sister
at
her
age
)
,
to
be
a
great
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
reading
this
aloud
to
Miss
Matty
,
who
smiled
and
sighed
a
little
at
the
hope
,
so
fondly
expressed
,
that
"
little
Matty
might
not
be
vain
,
even
if
she
were
a
bewty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
very
pretty
hair
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mist
Matilda
;
"
and
not
a
bad
mouth
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
I
saw
her
soon
afterwards
adjust
her
cap
and
draw
herself
up
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
return
to
Mrs
Jenkyns
's
letters
.
 
<EOS>
She
told
her
husband
about
the
poor
in
the
parish
;
what
homely
domestic
medicines
she
had
administered
;
what
kitchen
physic
she
had
sent
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
evidently
held
his
displeasure
as
a
rod
in
pickle
over
the
heads
of
all
the
ne'er
-
do
-
wells
.
 
<EOS>
She
asked
for
his
directions
about
the
cows
and
pigs
;
and
did
not
always
obtain
them
,
as
I
have
shown
before
.
  
<EOS>
The
kind
old
grandmother
was
dead
when
a
little
boy
was
born
,
soon
after
the
publication
of
the
sermon
;
but
there
was
another
letter
of
exhortation
from
the
grandfather
,
more
stringent
and
admonitory
than
ever
,
now
that
there
was
a
boy
to
be
guarded
from
the
snares
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
He
described
all
the
various
sins
into
which
men
might
fall
,
until
I
wondered
how
any
man
ever
came
to
a
natural
death
.
 
<EOS>
The
gallows
seemed
as
if
it
must
have
been
the
termination
of
the
lives
of
most
of
the
grandfather
's
friends
and
acquaintance
;
and
I
was
not
surprised
at
the
way
in
which
he
spoke
of
this
life
being
"
a
vale
of
tears
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
curious
that
I
should
never
have
heard
of
this
brother
before
;
but
I
concluded
that
he
had
died
young
,
or
else
surely
his
name
would
have
been
alluded
to
by
his
sisters
.
  
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
we
came
to
packets
of
Miss
Jenkyns
's
letters
.
 
<EOS>
These
Miss
Matty
did
regret
to
burn
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
all
the
others
had
been
only
interesting
to
those
who
loved
the
writers
,
and
that
it
seemed
as
if
it
would
have
hurt
her
to
allow
them
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
strangers
,
who
had
not
known
her
dear
mother
,
and
how
good
she
was
,
although
she
did
not
always
spell
,
quite
in
the
modern
fashion
;
but
Deborah
's
letters
were
so
very
superior
!
 
<EOS>
Any
one
might
profit
by
reading
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
long
time
since
she
had
read
Mrs
Chapone
,
but
she
knew
she
used
to
think
that
Deborah
could
have
said
the
same
things
quite
as
well
;
and
as
for
Mrs
Carter
!
<EOS>
people
thought
a
deal
of
her
letters
,
just
because
she
had
written
"
Epictetus
,
"
but
she
was
quite
sure
Deborah
would
never
have
made
use
of
such
a
common
expression
as
"
I
canna
be
fashed
!
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
did
grudge
burning
these
letters
,
it
was
evident
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
not
let
them
be
carelessly
passed
over
with
any
quiet
reading
,
and
skipping
,
to
myself
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
them
from
me
,
and
even
lighted
the
second
candle
in
order
to
read
them
aloud
with
a
proper
emphasis
,
and
without
stumbling
over
the
big
words
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
dear
!
<EOS>
how
I
wanted
facts
instead
of
reflections
,
before
those
letters
were
concluded
!
 
<EOS>
They
lasted
us
two
nights
;
and
I
wo
n't
deny
that
I
made
use
of
the
time
to
think
of
many
other
things
,
and
yet
I
was
always
at
my
post
at
the
end
of
each
sentence
.
  
<EOS>
The
rector
's
letters
,
and
those
of
his
wife
and
mother
-
in
-
law
,
had
all
been
tolerably
short
and
pithy
,
written
in
a
straight
hand
,
with
the
lines
very
close
together
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
the
whole
letter
was
contained
on
a
mere
scrap
of
paper
.
 
<EOS>
The
paper
was
very
yellow
,
and
the
ink
very
brown
;
some
of
the
sheets
were
(
as
Miss
Matty
made
me
observe
)
<EOS>
the
old
original
post
,
with
the
stamp
in
the
corner
representing
a
post
-
boy
riding
for
life
and
twanging
his
horn
.
 
<EOS>
The
letters
of
Mrs
Jenkyns
and
her
mother
were
fastened
with
a
great
round
red
wafer
;
for
it
was
before
Miss
Edgeworth
's
"
patronage
"
had
banished
wafers
from
polite
society
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
evident
,
from
the
tenor
of
what
was
said
,
that
franks
were
in
great
request
,
and
were
even
used
as
a
means
of
paying
debts
by
needy
members
of
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
The
rector
sealed
his
epistles
with
an
immense
coat
of
arms
,
and
showed
by
the
care
with
which
he
had
performed
this
ceremony
that
he
expected
they
should
be
cut
open
,
not
broken
by
any
thoughtless
or
impatient
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Miss
Jenkyns
's
letters
were
of
a
later
date
in
form
and
writing
.
 
<EOS>
She
wrote
on
the
square
sheet
which
we
have
learned
to
call
old
-
fashioned
.
 
<EOS>
Her
hand
was
admirably
calculated
,
together
with
her
use
of
many
-
syllabled
words
,
to
fill
up
a
sheet
,
and
then
came
the
pride
and
delight
of
crossing
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Miss
Matty
got
sadly
puzzled
with
this
,
for
the
words
gathered
size
like
snowballs
,
and
towards
the
end
of
her
letter
Miss
Jenkyns
used
to
become
quite
sesquipedalian
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
to
her
father
,
slightly
theological
and
controversial
in
its
tone
,
she
had
spoken
of
Herod
,
Tetrarch
of
Idumea
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
read
it
"
Herod
Petrarch
of
Etruria
,
"
and
was
just
as
well
pleased
as
if
she
had
been
right
.
  
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
quite
remember
the
date
,
but
I
think
it
was
in
1805
that
Miss
Jenkyns
wrote
the
longest
series
of
letters
 
on
occasion
of
her
absence
on
a
visit
to
some
friends
near
Newcastle
-
upon
-
Tyne
.
<EOS>
These
friends
were
intimate
with
the
commandant
of
the
garrison
there
,
and
heard
from
him
of
all
the
preparations
that
were
being
made
to
repel
the
invasion
of
Buonaparte
,
which
some
people
imagined
might
take
place
at
the
mouth
of
the
Tyne
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
was
evidently
very
much
alarmed
;
and
the
first
part
of
her
letters
was
often
written
in
pretty
intelligible
English
,
conveying
particulars
of
the
preparations
which
were
made
in
the
family
with
whom
she
was
residing
against
the
dreaded
event
;
the
bundles
of
clothes
that
were
packed
up
ready
for
a
flight
to
Alston
Moor
(
a
wild
hilly
piece
of
ground
between
Northumberland
and
Cumberland
)
;
the
signal
that
was
to
be
given
for
this
flight
,
and
for
the
simultaneous
turning
out
of
the
volunteers
under
arms
 
which
said
signal
was
to
consist
(
if
I
remember
rightly
)
in
ringing
the
church
bells
in
a
particular
and
ominous
manner
.
 
<EOS>
One
day
,
when
Miss
Jenkyns
and
her
hosts
were
at
a
dinner
-
party
in
Newcastle
,
this
warning
summons
was
actually
given
(
not
a
very
wise
proceeding
,
if
there
be
any
truth
in
the
moral
attached
to
the
fable
of
the
Boy
and
the
Wolf
;
but
so
it
was
)
,
and
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
,
hardly
recovered
from
her
fright
,
wrote
the
next
day
to
describe
the
sound
,
the
breathless
shock
,
the
hurry
and
alarm
;
and
then
,
taking
breath
,
she
added
,
"
How
trivial
,
my
dear
father
,
do
all
our
apprehensions
of
the
last
evening
appear
,
at
the
present
moment
,
to
calm
and
enquiring
minds
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
here
Miss
Matty
broke
in
with
     
<EOS>
"
But
,
indeed
,
my
dear
,
they
were
not
at
all
trivial
or
trifling
at
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
used
to
wake
up
in
the
night
many
a
time
and
think
I
heard
the
tramp
of
the
French
entering
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
Many
people
talked
of
hiding
themselves
in
the
salt
mines
 
and
meat
would
have
kept
capitally
down
there
,
only
perhaps
we
should
have
been
thirsty
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
father
preached
a
whole
set
of
sermons
on
the
occasion
;
one
set
in
the
mornings
,
all
about
David
and
Goliath
,
to
spirit
up
the
people
to
fighting
with
spades
or
bricks
,
if
need
were
;
and
the
other
set
in
the
afternoons
,
proving
that
Napoleon
(
that
was
another
name
for
Bony
,
as
we
used
to
call
him
)
was
all
the
same
as
an
Apollyon
and
Abaddon
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
my
father
rather
thought
he
should
be
asked
to
print
this
last
set
;
but
the
parish
had
,
perhaps
,
had
enough
of
them
with
hearing
.
"
  
<EOS>
Peter
Marmaduke
Arley
Jenkyns
(
"
poor
Peter
!
"
<EOS>
as
Miss
Matty
began
to
call
him
)
was
at
school
at
Shrewsbury
by
this
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
rector
took
up
his
pen
,
and
rubbed
up
his
Latin
once
more
,
to
correspond
with
his
boy
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
clear
that
the
lad
's
were
what
are
called
show
letters
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
of
a
highly
mental
description
,
giving
an
account
of
his
studies
,
and
his
intellectual
hopes
of
various
kinds
,
with
an
occasional
quotation
from
the
classics
;
but
,
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
the
animal
nature
broke
out
in
such
a
little
sentence
as
this
,
evidently
written
in
a
trembling
hurry
,
after
the
letter
had
been
inspected
:
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
dear
,
do
send
me
a
cake
,
and
put
plenty
of
citron
in
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
"
mother
dear
"
probably
answered
her
boy
in
the
form
of
cakes
and
"
goody
,
"
for
there
were
none
of
her
letters
among
this
set
;
but
a
whole
collection
of
the
rector
's
,
to
whom
the
Latin
in
his
boy
's
letters
was
like
a
trumpet
to
the
old
war
-
horse
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
much
about
Latin
,
certainly
,
and
it
is
,
perhaps
,
an
ornamental
language
,
but
not
very
useful
,
I
think
 
at
least
to
judge
from
the
bits
I
remember
out
of
the
rector
's
letters
.
 
<EOS>
One
was
,
"
You
have
not
got
that
town
in
your
map
of
Ireland
;
but
Bonus
Bernardus
non
videt
omnia
,
as
the
Proverbia
say
.
"
 
<EOS>
Presently
it
became
very
evident
that
"
poor
Peter
"
got
himself
into
many
scrapes
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
letters
of
stilted
penitence
to
his
father
,
for
some
wrong
-
doing
;
and
among
them
all
was
a
badly
-
written
,
badly
-
sealed
,
badly
-
directed
,
blotted
note
:
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
dear
,
dear
,
dearest
mother
,
I
will
be
a
better
boy
;
I
will
,
indeed
;
but
do
n't
,
please
,
be
ill
for
me
;
I
am
not
worth
it
;
but
I
will
be
good
,
darling
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
could
not
speak
for
crying
,
after
she
had
read
this
note
.
 
<EOS>
She
gave
it
to
me
in
silence
,
and
then
got
up
and
took
it
to
her
sacred
recesses
in
her
own
room
,
for
fear
,
by
any
chance
,
it
might
get
burnt
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
Peter
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
;
"
he
was
always
in
scrapes
;
he
was
too
easy
.
 
<EOS>
They
led
him
wrong
,
and
then
left
him
in
the
lurch
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
too
fond
of
mischief
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
never
resist
a
joke
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Peter
!
"
   
<EOS>
POOR
PETER
 
<EOS>
Poor
Peter
's
career
lay
before
him
rather
pleasantly
mapped
out
by
kind
friends
,
but
Bonus
Bernardus
non
videt
omnia
,
in
this
map
too
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
win
honours
at
the
Shrewsbury
School
,
and
carry
them
thick
to
Cambridge
,
and
after
that
,
a
living
awaited
him
,
the
gift
of
his
godfather
,
Sir
Peter
Arley
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Peter
!
<EOS>
his
lot
in
life
was
very
different
to
what
his
friends
had
hoped
and
planned
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
told
me
all
about
it
,
and
I
think
it
was
a
relief
when
she
had
done
so
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
the
darling
of
his
mother
,
who
seemed
to
dote
on
all
her
children
,
though
she
was
,
perhaps
,
a
little
afraid
of
Deborah
's
superior
acquirements
.
 
<EOS>
Deborah
was
the
favourite
of
her
father
,
and
when
Peter
disappointed
him
,
she
became
his
pride
.
 
<EOS>
The
sole
honour
Peter
brought
away
from
Shrewsbury
was
the
reputation
of
being
the
best
good
fellow
that
ever
was
,
and
of
being
the
captain
of
the
school
in
the
art
of
practical
joking
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
was
disappointed
,
but
set
about
remedying
the
matter
in
a
manly
way
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
afford
to
send
Peter
to
read
with
any
tutor
,
but
he
could
read
with
him
himself
;
and
Miss
Matty
told
me
much
of
the
awful
preparations
in
the
way
of
dictionaries
and
lexicons
that
were
made
in
her
father
's
study
the
morning
Peter
began
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
poor
mother
!
"
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
remember
how
she
used
to
stand
in
the
hall
,
just
near
enough
the
study
-
door
,
to
catch
the
tone
of
my
father
's
voice
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
tell
in
a
moment
if
all
was
going
right
,
by
her
face
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
did
go
right
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
went
wrong
at
last
?
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
That
tiresome
Latin
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
<EOS>
it
was
not
the
Latin
.
 
<EOS>
Peter
was
in
high
favour
with
my
father
,
for
he
worked
up
well
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
seemed
to
think
that
the
Cranford
people
might
be
joked
about
,
and
made
fun
of
,
and
they
did
not
like
it
;
nobody
does
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
always
hoaxing
them
;
"
hoaxing
"
is
not
a
pretty
word
,
my
dear
,
and
I
hope
you
wo
n't
tell
your
father
<EOS>
I
used
it
,
<EOS>
for
I
should
not
like
him
to
think
that
I
was
not
choice
in
my
language
,
after
living
with
such
a
woman
as
Deborah
.
 
<EOS>
And
be
sure
you
never
use
it
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
it
slipped
out
of
my
mouth
,
except
it
was
that
I
was
thinking
of
poor
Peter
<EOS>
and
it
was
always
his
expression
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
a
very
gentlemanly
boy
in
many
things
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
like
dear
Captain
Brown
in
always
being
ready
to
help
any
old
person
or
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
he
did
like
joking
and
making
fun
;
and
he
seemed
to
think
the
old
ladies
in
Cranford
would
believe
anything
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
many
old
ladies
living
here
then
;
we
are
principally
ladies
now
,
I
know
,
but
we
are
not
so
old
as
the
ladies
used
to
be
when
I
was
a
girl
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
laugh
to
think
of
some
of
Peter
's
jokes
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
my
dear
,
I
wo
n't
tell
you
of
them
,
because
they
might
not
shock
you
as
they
ought
to
do
,
and
they
were
very
shocking
.
 
<EOS>
He
even
took
in
my
father
once
,
by
dressing
himself
up
as
a
lady
that
was
passing
through
the
town
and
wished
to
see
the
Rector
of
Cranford
,
"
who
had
published
that
admirable
Assize
Sermon
.
"
 
<EOS>
Peter
said
he
was
awfully
frightened
himself
when
he
saw
how
my
father
took
it
all
in
,
and
even
offered
to
copy
out
all
his
Napoleon
Buonaparte
sermons
for
her
 
him
,
I
mean
 
<EOS>
no
,
her
,
for
Peter
was
a
lady
then
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
me
he
was
more
terrified
than
he
ever
was
before
,
all
the
time
my
father
was
speaking
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
think
my
father
would
have
believed
him
;
and
yet
if
he
had
not
,
it
would
have
been
a
sad
thing
for
Peter
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
he
was
none
so
glad
of
it
,
for
my
father
kept
him
hard
at
work
copying
out
all
those
twelve
Buonaparte
sermons
for
the
lady
 
that
was
for
Peter
himself
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
the
lady
.
 
<EOS>
And
once
when
he
wanted
to
go
fishing
,
Peter
said
,
"
Confound
the
woman
!
"
 
<EOS>
very
bad
language
,
my
dear
,
but
<EOS>
Peter
was
not
always
so
guarded
as
he
should
have
been
;
my
father
was
so
angry
with
him
,
it
nearly
frightened
me
out
of
my
wits
:
 
and
yet
I
could
hardly
keep
from
laughing
at
the
little
curtseys
Peter
kept
making
,
quite
slyly
,
whenever
my
father
spoke
of
the
lady
's
excellent
taste
and
sound
discrimination
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
Miss
Jenkyns
know
of
these
tricks
?
"
said
I.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
Deborah
would
have
been
too
much
shocked
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
no
one
knew
but
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
always
known
of
Peter
's
plans
;
but
sometimes
he
did
not
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
used
to
say
the
old
ladies
in
the
town
wanted
something
to
talk
about
;
but
I
do
n't
think
they
did
.
<EOS>
They
had
the
St
James
's
Chronicle
three
times
a
week
,
just
as
we
have
now
,
and
we
have
plenty
to
say
;
and
I
remember
the
clacking
noise
there
always
was
when
some
of
the
ladies
got
together
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
probably
,
schoolboys
talk
more
than
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
there
was
a
terrible
,
sad
thing
happened
.
"
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
got
up
,
went
to
the
door
,
and
opened
it
;
no
one
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
She
rang
the
bell
for
Martha
,
and
when
Martha
came
,
her
mistress
told
her
to
go
for
eggs
to
a
farm
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
lock
the
door
after
you
,
Martha
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
not
afraid
to
go
,
are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
ma'am
,
not
at
all
;
Jem
Hearn
will
be
only
too
proud
to
go
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
drew
herself
up
,
and
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
,
she
wished
that
Martha
had
more
maidenly
reserve
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
'll
put
out
the
candle
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
talk
just
as
well
by
firelight
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
There
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
you
see
,
Deborah
had
gone
from
home
for
a
fortnight
or
so
;
it
was
a
very
still
,
quiet
day
,
I
remember
,
overhead
;
and
the
lilacs
were
all
in
flower
,
so
I
suppose
it
was
spring
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
had
gone
out
to
see
some
sick
people
in
the
parish
;
I
recollect
seeing
him
leave
the
house
with
his
wig
and
shovel
-
hat
and
cane
.
 
<EOS>
What
possessed
our
poor
Peter
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
;
he
had
the
sweetest
temper
,
and
yet
he
always
seemed
to
like
to
plague
Deborah
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
laughed
at
his
jokes
,
and
thought
him
ungenteel
,
and
not
careful
enough
about
improving
his
mind
;
and
that
vexed
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
he
went
to
her
room
,
it
seems
,
and
dressed
himself
in
her
old
gown
,
and
shawl
,
and
bonnet
;
just
the
things
she
used
to
wear
in
Cranford
,
and
was
known
by
everywhere
;
and
he
made
the
pillow
into
a
little
 
you
are
sure
you
locked
the
door
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
for
I
should
not
like
anyone
to
hear
 
into
 
into
a
little
baby
,
with
white
long
clothes
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
only
,
as
he
told
me
afterwards
,
to
make
something
to
talk
about
in
the
town
;
he
never
thought
of
it
as
affecting
Deborah
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
went
and
walked
up
and
down
in
the
Filbert
walk
 
just
half
-
hidden
by
the
rails
,
and
half
-
seen
;
and
he
cuddled
his
pillow
,
just
like
a
baby
,
and
talked
to
it
all
the
nonsense
people
do
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
dear
!
<EOS>
and
my
father
came
stepping
stately
up
the
street
,
as
he
always
did
;
and
what
should
he
see
but
a
little
black
crowd
of
people
 
<EOS>
I
daresay
as
many
as
twenty
 
all
peeping
through
his
garden
rails
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
thought
,
at
first
,
they
were
only
looking
at
a
new
rhododendron
that
was
in
full
bloom
,
and
that
he
was
very
proud
of
;
and
he
walked
slower
,
that
they
might
have
more
time
to
admire
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
wondered
if
he
could
make
out
a
sermon
from
the
occasion
,
and
thought
,
perhaps
,
there
was
some
relation
between
the
rhododendrons
and
the
lilies
of
the
field
.
 
<EOS>
My
poor
father
!
 
<EOS>
When
he
came
nearer
,
he
began
to
wonder
that
they
did
not
see
him
;
but
their
heads
were
all
so
close
together
,
peeping
and
peeping
!
 
<EOS>
My
father
was
amongst
them
,
meaning
,
he
said
,
to
ask
them
to
walk
into
the
garden
with
him
,
and
admire
the
beautiful
vegetable
production
,
<EOS>
when
 
oh
,
my
dear
,
I
tremble
to
think
of
it
 
<EOS>
he
looked
through
the
rails
himself
,
and
saw
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
he
thought
he
saw
,
but
old
Clare
told
me
his
face
went
quite
grey
-
white
with
anger
,
and
his
eyes
blazed
out
under
his
frowning
black
brows
;
and
he
spoke
out
 
oh
,
so
terribly
!
 
and
bade
them
all
stop
where
they
were
 
not
one
of
them
to
go
,
not
one
of
them
to
stir
a
step
;
and
,
swift
as
light
,
he
was
in
at
the
garden
door
,
and
down
the
Filbert
walk
,
and
seized
hold
of
poor
Peter
,
and
tore
his
clothes
off
his
back
 
bonnet
,
shawl
,
gown
,
and
all
 
and
threw
the
pillow
among
the
people
over
the
railings
:
 
and
then
he
was
very
,
very
angry
indeed
,
and
before
all
the
people
he
lifted
up
his
cane
and
flogged
Peter
!
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
that
boy
's
trick
,
on
that
sunny
day
,
when
all
seemed
going
straight
and
well
,
broke
my
mother
's
heart
,
and
changed
my
father
for
life
.
 
<EOS>
It
did
,
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Old
Clare
said
,
Peter
looked
as
white
as
my
father
;
and
stood
as
still
as
a
statue
to
be
flogged
;
and
my
father
struck
hard
!
 
<EOS>
When
my
father
stopped
to
take
breath
,
Peter
said
,
"
Have
you
done
enough
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
quite
hoarsely
,
and
still
standing
quite
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
my
father
said
 
<EOS>
or
if
he
said
anything
.
 
<EOS>
But
old
Clare
said
,
Peter
turned
to
where
the
people
outside
the
railing
were
,
and
made
them
a
low
bow
,
as
grand
and
as
grave
as
any
gentleman
;
and
then
walked
slowly
into
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
in
the
store
-
room
helping
my
mother
to
make
cowslip
wine
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
abide
the
wine
now
,
nor
the
scent
of
the
flowers
;
they
turn
me
sick
and
faint
,
as
they
did
that
day
,
when
Peter
came
in
,
looking
as
haughty
as
any
man
 
indeed
,
looking
like
a
man
,
not
like
a
boy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
"
I
am
come
to
say
,
God
bless
you
for
ever
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
saw
his
lips
quiver
as
he
spoke
;
and
I
think
he
durst
not
say
anything
more
loving
,
for
the
purpose
that
was
in
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
rather
frightened
,
and
wondering
,
and
asked
him
what
was
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
smile
or
speak
,
but
put
his
arms
round
her
and
kissed
her
as
if
he
did
not
know
how
to
leave
off
;
and
before
she
could
speak
again
,
he
was
gone
.
 
<EOS>
We
talked
it
over
,
and
could
not
understand
it
,
and
she
bade
me
go
and
seek
my
father
,
and
ask
what
it
was
all
about
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
him
walking
up
and
down
,
looking
very
highly
displeased
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Tell
your
mother
I
have
flogged
Peter
,
and
that
he
richly
deserved
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
durst
not
ask
any
more
questions
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
told
my
mother
,
she
sat
down
,
quite
faint
,
for
a
minute
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
,
a
few
days
after
,
I
saw
the
poor
,
withered
cowslip
flowers
thrown
out
to
the
leaf
heap
,
to
decay
and
die
there
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
making
of
cowslip
wine
that
year
at
the
rectory
 
nor
,
indeed
,
ever
after
.
  
<EOS>
"
Presently
my
mother
went
to
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
thought
of
Queen
Esther
and
King
Ahasuerus
;
for
my
mother
was
very
pretty
and
delicate
-
looking
,
and
my
father
looked
as
terrible
as
King
Ahasuerus
.
 
<EOS>
Some
time
after
they
came
out
together
;
and
then
my
mother
told
me
what
had
happened
,
and
that
she
was
going
up
to
Peter
's
room
at
my
father
's
desire
 
though
she
was
not
to
tell
Peter
this
 
to
talk
the
matter
over
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
Peter
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
We
looked
over
the
house
;
no
Peter
was
there
!
 
<EOS>
Even
my
father
,
who
had
not
liked
to
join
in
the
search
at
first
,
helped
us
before
long
.
 
<EOS>
The
rectory
was
a
very
old
house
 
steps
up
into
a
room
,
steps
down
into
a
room
,
all
through
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
my
mother
went
calling
low
and
soft
,
as
if
to
reassure
the
poor
boy
,
"
Peter
!
<EOS>
Peter
,
dear
!
<EOS>
it
's
only
me
;
"
but
,
by
-
and
-
by
,
as
the
servants
came
back
from
the
errands
my
father
had
sent
them
,
in
different
directions
,
to
find
where
Peter
was
 
as
we
found
he
was
not
in
the
garden
,
nor
the
hayloft
,
nor
anywhere
about
 
my
mother
's
cry
grew
louder
and
wilder
,
Peter
!
 
<EOS>
Peter
,
my
darling
!
<EOS>
where
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
for
then
she
felt
and
understood
that
that
long
kiss
meant
some
sad
kind
of
"
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
afternoon
went
on
 
my
mother
never
resting
,
but
seeking
again
and
again
in
every
possible
place
that
had
been
looked
into
twenty
times
before
,
nay
,
that
she
had
looked
into
over
and
over
again
herself
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
sat
with
his
head
in
his
hands
,
not
speaking
except
when
his
messengers
came
in
,
bringing
no
tidings
;
then
he
lifted
up
his
face
,
so
strong
and
sad
,
and
told
them
to
go
again
in
some
new
direction
.
 
<EOS>
My
mother
kept
passing
from
room
to
room
,
in
and
out
of
the
house
,
moving
noiselessly
,
but
never
ceasing
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
she
nor
my
father
<EOS>
durst
leave
the
house
,
which
was
the
meeting
-
place
for
all
the
messengers
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
(
and
it
was
nearly
dark
)
,
my
father
rose
up
.
<EOS>
He
took
hold
of
my
mother
's
arm
as
she
came
with
wild
,
sad
pace
through
one
door
,
and
quickly
towards
another
.
 
<EOS>
She
started
at
the
touch
of
his
hand
,
for
she
had
forgotten
all
in
the
world
but
Peter
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Molly
!
"
said
he
,
"
I
did
not
think
all
this
would
happen
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
looked
into
her
face
for
comfort
 
<EOS>
her
poor
face
all
wild
and
white
;
for
neither
she
nor
my
father
had
dared
to
acknowledge
 
much
less
act
upon
 
the
terror
that
was
in
their
hearts
,
lest
Peter
should
have
made
away
with
himself
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
saw
no
conscious
look
in
his
wife
's
hot
,
dreary
eyes
,
and
he
missed
the
sympathy
that
she
had
always
been
ready
to
give
him
 
strong
man
as
he
was
,
and
at
the
dumb
despair
in
her
face
his
tears
began
to
flow
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
she
saw
this
,
a
gentle
sorrow
came
over
her
countenance
,
and
she
said
,
"
Dearest
John
!
<EOS>
do
n't
cry
;
come
with
me
,
and
we
'll
find
him
,
"
almost
as
cheerfully
as
if
she
knew
where
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
took
my
father
's
great
hand
in
her
little
soft
one
,
and
led
him
along
,
the
tears
dropping
as
he
walked
on
that
same
unceasing
,
weary
walk
,
from
room
to
room
,
through
house
and
garden
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
how
I
wished
for
Deborah
!
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
time
for
crying
,
for
now
all
seemed
to
depend
on
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
wrote
for
Deborah
to
come
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
sent
a
message
privately
to
that
same
Mr
Holbrook
's
house
 
<EOS>
poor
Mr
Holbrook
;
 
you
know
who
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
I
sent
a
message
to
him
,
but
I
sent
one
that
I
could
trust
to
know
if
Peter
was
at
his
house
.
 
<EOS>
For
at
one
time
Mr
Holbrook
was
an
occasional
visitor
at
the
rectory
 
<EOS>
you
know
he
was
Miss
Pole
's
cousin
 
<EOS>
and
he
had
been
very
kind
to
Peter
,
and
taught
him
how
to
fish
 
<EOS>
he
was
very
kind
to
everybody
,
and
I
thought
Peter
might
have
gone
off
there
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Holbrook
was
from
home
,
and
Peter
had
never
been
seen
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
night
now
;
but
the
doors
were
all
wide
open
,
and
my
father
and
mother
walked
on
and
on
;
it
was
more
than
an
hour
since
he
had
joined
her
,
and
I
do
n't
believe
they
had
ever
spoken
all
that
time
.
<EOS>
I
was
getting
the
parlour
fire
lighted
,
and
one
of
the
servants
was
preparing
tea
,
for
I
wanted
them
to
have
something
to
eat
and
drink
and
warm
them
,
when
old
Clare
asked
to
speak
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
have
borrowed
the
nets
from
the
weir
,
Miss
Matty
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
we
drag
the
ponds
to
-
night
,
or
wait
for
the
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
staring
in
his
face
to
gather
his
meaning
;
and
when
I
did
,
I
laughed
out
loud
.
 
<EOS>
The
horror
of
that
new
thought
 
our
bright
,
<EOS>
darling
Peter
,
cold
,
and
stark
,
and
dead
!
 
<EOS>
I
remember
the
ring
of
my
own
laugh
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
next
day
Deborah
was
at
home
before
I
was
myself
again
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
not
have
been
so
weak
as
to
give
way
as
I
had
done
;
but
my
screams
(
my
horrible
laughter
had
ended
in
crying
)
had
roused
my
sweet
dear
mother
,
whose
poor
wandering
wits
were
called
back
and
collected
as
soon
as
a
child
needed
her
care
.
 
<EOS>
She
and
Deborah
sat
by
my
bedside
;
I
knew
by
the
looks
of
each
that
there
had
been
no
news
of
Peter
 
<EOS>
no
awful
,
ghastly
news
,
which
was
what
I
most
had
dreaded
in
my
dull
state
between
sleeping
and
waking
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
same
result
of
all
the
searching
had
brought
something
of
the
same
relief
to
my
mother
,
to
whom
,
I
am
sure
,
<EOS>
the
thought
that
Peter
might
even
then
be
hanging
dead
in
some
of
the
familiar
home
places
had
caused
that
never
-
ending
walk
of
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
Her
soft
eyes
never
were
the
same
again
after
that
;
they
had
always
a
restless
,
craving
look
,
as
if
seeking
for
what
they
could
not
find
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
was
an
awful
time
;
coming
down
like
a
thunder
-
bolt
on
the
still
sunny
day
when
the
lilacs
were
all
in
bloom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
was
Mr
Peter
?
"
said
I.
  
"
He
had
made
his
way
to
Liverpool
;
and
there
was
war
then
;
and
some
of
the
king
's
ships
lay
off
the
mouth
of
the
Mersey
;
and
they
were
only
too
glad
to
have
a
fine
likely
boy
such
as
him
(
five
foot
nine
<EOS>
he
was
)
,
come
to
offer
himself
.
 
<EOS>
The
captain
wrote
to
my
father
,
and
Peter
wrote
to
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
Stay
!
<EOS>
those
letters
will
be
somewhere
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
lighted
the
candle
,
and
found
the
captain
's
letter
and
Peter
's
too
.
 
<EOS>
And
we
also
found
a
little
simple
begging
letter
from
Mrs
Jenkyns
to
Peter
,
addressed
to
him
at
the
house
of
an
old
schoolfellow
whither
she
fancied
he
might
have
gone
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
returned
it
unopened
;
and
unopened
it
had
remained
ever
since
,
having
been
inadvertently
put
by
among
the
other
letters
of
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
it
:
    
"
MY
DEAREST
PETER
,
 
<EOS>
You
did
not
think
we
should
be
so
sorry
as
we
are
,
I
know
,
or
you
would
never
have
gone
away
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
too
good
.
<EOS>
Your
father
sits
and
sighs
till
my
heart
aches
to
hear
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
can
not
hold
up
his
head
for
grief
;
and
yet
he
only
did
what
he
thought
was
right
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
has
been
too
severe
,
and
perhaps
I
have
not
been
kind
enough
;
but
God
knows
how
we
love
you
,
my
dear
only
boy
.
 
<EOS>
Don
looks
so
sorry
you
are
gone
.
 
<EOS>
Come
back
,
and
make
us
happy
,
who
love
you
so
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
come
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
Peter
did
not
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
That
spring
day
was
the
last
time
he
ever
saw
his
mother
's
face
.
 
<EOS>
The
writer
of
the
letter
 
the
last
 
the
only
person
who
had
ever
seen
what
was
written
in
it
,
was
dead
long
ago
;
and
I
,
a
stranger
,
not
born
at
the
time
when
this
occurrence
took
place
,
was
the
one
to
open
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
captain
's
letter
summoned
the
father
and
mother
to
Liverpool
instantly
,
if
they
wished
to
see
their
boy
;
and
,
by
some
of
the
wild
chances
of
life
,
the
captain
's
letter
had
been
detained
somewhere
,
somehow
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
went
on
,
"
And
it
was
racetime
,
and
all
the
post
-
horses
at
Cranford
were
gone
to
the
races
;
but
my
father
and
mother
set
off
in
our
own
gig
 
<EOS>
and
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
they
were
too
late
 
<EOS>
the
ship
was
gone
!
 
<EOS>
And
now
read
Peter
's
letter
to
my
mother
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
full
of
love
,
and
sorrow
,
and
pride
in
his
new
profession
,
and
a
sore
sense
of
his
disgrace
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
at
Cranford
;
but
ending
with
a
passionate
entreaty
that
she
would
come
and
see
him
before
he
left
the
Mersey
:
 
<EOS>
"
Mother
;
we
may
go
into
battle
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
we
shall
,
and
lick
those
French
:
 
<EOS>
but
I
must
see
you
again
before
that
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
she
was
too
late
,
"
said
Miss
Matty
;
"
too
late
!
"
  
<EOS>
We
sat
in
silence
,
pondering
on
the
full
meaning
of
those
sad
,
sad
words
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
I
asked
Miss
Matty
to
tell
me
how
her
mother
bore
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
she
was
patience
itself
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
never
been
strong
,
and
this
weakened
her
terribly
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
used
to
sit
looking
at
her
:
 
far
more
sad
than
she
was
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
as
if
he
could
look
at
nothing
else
when
she
was
by
;
and
he
was
so
humble
 
<EOS>
so
very
gentle
now
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
,
perhaps
,
speak
in
his
old
way
 
laying
down
the
law
,
as
it
were
 
and
then
,
in
a
minute
or
two
,
he
would
come
round
and
put
his
hand
on
our
shoulders
,
and
ask
us
in
a
low
voice
,
if
he
had
said
anything
to
hurt
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
wonder
at
his
speaking
so
to
Deborah
,
for
she
was
so
clever
;
but
I
could
not
bear
to
hear
him
talking
so
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
you
see
,
he
saw
what
we
did
not
 
that
it
was
killing
my
mother
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
killing
her
(
put
out
the
candle
,
my
dear
;
I
can
talk
better
in
the
dark
)
,
for
she
was
but
a
frail
woman
,
and
ill
-
fitted
to
stand
the
fright
and
shock
she
had
gone
through
;
and
she
would
smile
at
him
and
comfort
him
,
not
in
words
,
but
in
her
looks
and
tones
,
which
were
always
cheerful
when
he
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
would
speak
of
how
she
thought
Peter
stood
a
good
chance
of
being
admiral
very
soon
 
<EOS>
he
was
so
brave
and
clever
;
and
<EOS>
how
she
thought
of
seeing
him
in
his
navy
uniform
,
and
what
sort
of
hats
admirals
wore
;
and
how
much
more
fit
he
was
to
be
a
sailor
than
a
clergyman
;
and
all
in
that
way
,
just
to
make
my
father
think
she
was
quite
glad
of
what
came
of
that
unlucky
morning
's
work
,
and
the
flogging
which
was
always
in
his
mind
,
as
we
all
knew
.
 
<EOS>
But
oh
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
the
bitter
,
bitter
crying
she
had
when
she
was
alone
;
and
at
last
,
as
she
grew
weaker
,
she
could
not
keep
her
tears
in
when
Deborah
or
me
was
by
,
and
would
give
us
message
after
message
for
Peter
<EOS>
(
his
ship
had
gone
to
the
Mediterranean
,
or
somewhere
down
there
,
and
then
he
was
ordered
off
to
India
,
and
there
was
no
overland
route
then
)
;
but
she
still
said
that
no
one
knew
where
their
death
lay
in
wait
,
and
that
we
were
not
to
think
hers
was
near
.
 
<EOS>
We
did
not
think
it
,
but
we
knew
it
,
as
we
saw
her
fading
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
it
's
very
foolish
of
me
,
I
know
,
when
in
all
likelihood
I
am
so
near
seeing
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
only
think
,
love
!
<EOS>
the
very
day
after
her
death
 
<EOS>
for
she
did
not
live
quite
a
twelvemonth
after
Peter
went
away
 
the
very
day
after
 
came
a
parcel
for
her
from
India
 
from
her
poor
boy
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
large
,
soft
,
white
Indian
shawl
,
with
just
a
little
narrow
border
all
round
;
just
what
my
mother
would
have
liked
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
thought
it
might
rouse
my
father
,
for
he
had
sat
with
her
hand
in
his
all
night
long
;
so
Deborah
took
it
in
to
him
,
and
Peter
's
letter
to
her
,
and
all
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
he
took
no
notice
;
and
we
tried
to
make
a
kind
of
light
careless
talk
about
the
shawl
,
opening
it
out
and
admiring
it
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
suddenly
,
he
got
up
,
and
spoke
:
 
"
She
shall
be
buried
in
it
,
"
he
said
;
"
Peter
shall
have
that
comfort
;
and
she
would
have
liked
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
perhaps
it
was
not
reasonable
,
but
what
could
we
do
or
say
?
<EOS>
One
gives
people
in
grief
their
own
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
it
up
and
felt
it
:
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
just
such
a
shawl
as
she
wished
for
when
she
was
married
,
and
her
mother
did
not
give
it
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
of
it
till
after
,
or
she
should
have
had
it
 
<EOS>
she
should
;
but
she
shall
have
it
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
mother
looked
so
lovely
in
her
death
!
 
<EOS>
She
was
always
pretty
,
and
now
she
looked
fair
,
and
waxen
,
and
young
 
younger
than
Deborah
,
as
she
stood
trembling
and
shivering
by
her
.
 
<EOS>
We
decked
her
in
the
long
soft
folds
;
she
lay
smiling
,
as
if
pleased
;
and
people
came
 
all
Cranford
came
 
to
beg
to
see
her
,
for
they
had
loved
her
dearly
,
as
well
they
might
;
and
the
countrywomen
brought
posies
;
old
Clare
's
wife
brought
some
white
violets
and
begged
they
might
lie
on
her
breast
.
  
<EOS>
"
Deborah
said
to
me
,
the
day
of
my
mother
's
funeral
,
that
if
she
had
a
hundred
offers
she
never
would
marry
and
leave
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
very
likely
she
would
have
so
many
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
she
had
one
;
but
it
was
not
less
to
her
credit
to
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
such
a
daughter
to
my
father
as
I
think
there
never
was
before
or
since
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
failed
him
,
and
she
read
book
after
book
,
and
wrote
,
and
copied
,
and
was
always
at
his
service
in
any
parish
business
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
do
many
more
things
than
my
poor
mother
could
;
she
even
once
wrote
a
letter
to
the
bishop
for
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
missed
my
mother
sorely
;
the
whole
parish
noticed
it
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
he
was
less
active
;
I
think
he
was
more
so
,
and
more
patient
in
helping
every
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
all
I
could
to
set
Deborah
at
liberty
to
be
with
him
;
for
I
knew
I
was
good
for
little
,
and
that
my
best
work
in
the
world
was
to
do
odd
jobs
quietly
,
and
set
others
at
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
father
was
a
changed
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
Mr
Peter
ever
come
home
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
once
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
home
a
lieutenant
;
he
did
not
get
to
be
admiral
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
and
my
father
were
such
friends
!
 
<EOS>
My
father
took
him
into
every
house
in
the
parish
,
he
was
so
proud
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
walked
out
without
Peter
's
arm
to
lean
upon
.
 
<EOS>
Deborah
used
to
smile
<EOS>
(
I
do
n't
think
we
ever
laughed
again
after
my
mother
's
death
)
,
and
say
she
was
quite
put
in
a
corner
.
 
<EOS>
Not
but
what
my
father
always
wanted
her
when
there
was
letter
-
writing
or
reading
to
be
done
,
or
anything
to
be
settled
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
?
"
said
I
,
after
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
Peter
went
to
sea
again
;
and
,
by
-
and
-
by
,
my
father
died
,
blessing
us
both
,
and
thanking
Deborah
for
all
she
had
been
to
him
;
and
,
of
course
,
our
circumstances
were
changed
;
and
,
instead
of
living
at
the
rectory
,
and
keeping
three
maids
and
a
man
,
we
had
to
come
to
this
small
house
,
and
be
content
with
a
servant
-
of
-
all-
work
;
but
,
as
Deborah
used
to
say
,
we
have
always
lived
genteelly
,
even
if
circumstances
have
compelled
us
to
simplicity
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Deborah
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
Mr
Peter
?
"
asked
I.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
there
was
some
great
war
in
India
 
<EOS>
I
forget
what
they
call
it
 
<EOS>
and
we
have
never
heard
of
Peter
since
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
he
is
dead
myself
;
and
it
sometimes
fidgets
me
that
we
have
never
put
on
mourning
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
again
,
when
I
sit
by
myself
,
and
all
the
house
is
still
,
I
think
I
hear
his
step
coming
up
the
street
,
and
my
heart
begins
to
flutter
and
beat
;
but
the
sound
always
goes
past
 
and
Peter
never
comes
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
Martha
back
?
 
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
I'LL
go
,
my
dear
;
I
can
always
find
my
way
in
the
dark
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
And
a
blow
of
fresh
air
at
the
door
will
do
my
head
good
,
and
it
's
rather
got
a
trick
of
aching
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
she
pattered
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
lighted
the
candle
,
to
give
the
room
a
cheerful
appearance
against
her
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
Martha
?
"
asked
I.
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
am
rather
uncomfortable
,
for
I
heard
such
a
strange
noise
,
just
as
I
was
opening
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
I
asked
,
for
her
eyes
were
round
with
affright
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
street
 
just
outside
 
it
sounded
like
"
     
"
Talking
?
<EOS>
"
I
put
in
,
as
she
hesitated
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
kissing
"
      
VISITING
 
<EOS>
One
morning
,
as
Miss
Matty
and
I
sat
at
our
work
 
<EOS>
it
was
before
twelve
o'clock
,
and
Miss
Matty
had
not
changed
the
cap
with
yellow
ribbons
that
had
been
Miss
Jenkyns
's
best
,
and
which
Miss
Matty
was
now
wearing
out
in
private
,
putting
on
the
one
made
in
imitation
of
Mrs
Jamieson
's
at
all
times
when
she
expected
to
be
seen
 
Martha
came
up
,
and
asked
if
Miss
Betty
Barker
might
speak
to
her
mistress
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
assented
,
and
quickly
disappeared
to
change
the
yellow
ribbons
,
while
Miss
Barker
came
upstairs
;
but
,
as
she
had
forgotten
her
spectacles
,
and
was
rather
flurried
by
the
unusual
time
of
the
visit
,
I
was
not
surprised
to
see
her
return
with
one
cap
on
the
top
of
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
quite
unconscious
of
it
herself
,
and
looked
at
us
,
with
bland
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
do
I
think
Miss
Barker
perceived
it
;
for
,
putting
aside
the
little
circumstance
that
she
was
not
so
young
as
she
had
been
,
she
was
very
much
absorbed
in
her
errand
,
which
she
delivered
herself
of
with
an
oppressive
modesty
that
found
vent
in
endless
apologies
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Betty
Barker
was
the
daughter
of
the
old
clerk
at
Cranford
who
had
officiated
in
Mr
Jenkyns
's
time
.
 
<EOS>
She
and
her
sister
had
had
pretty
good
situations
as
ladies
'
maids
,
and
had
saved
money
enough
to
set
up
a
milliner
's
shop
,
which
had
been
patronised
by
the
ladies
in
the
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Arley
,
for
instance
,
would
occasionally
give
Miss
Barkers
the
pattern
of
an
old
cap
of
hers
,
which
they
immediately
copied
and
circulated
among
the
elite
of
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
the
elite
,
for
Miss
Barkers
had
caught
the
trick
of
the
place
,
and
piqued
themselves
upon
their
"
aristocratic
connection
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
They
would
not
sell
their
caps
and
ribbons
to
anyone
without
a
pedigree
.
 
<EOS>
Many
a
farmer
's
wife
or
daughter
turned
away
huffed
from
Miss
Barkers
'
select
millinery
,
and
went
rather
to
the
universal
shop
,
where
the
profits
of
brown
soap
and
moist
sugar
enabled
the
proprietor
to
go
straight
to
(
Paris
,
he
said
,
until
he
found
his
customers
too
patriotic
and
John
Bullish
to
wear
what
the
Mounseers
wore
)
<EOS>
London
,
where
,
as
he
often
told
his
customers
,
Queen
Adelaide
had
appeared
,
only
the
very
week
before
,
in
a
cap
exactly
like
the
one
he
showed
them
,
trimmed
with
yellow
and
blue
ribbons
,
and
had
been
complimented
by
King
William
on
the
becoming
nature
of
her
head
-
dress
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Barkers
,
who
confined
themselves
to
truth
,
and
did
not
approve
of
miscellaneous
customers
,
throve
notwithstanding
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
self
-
denying
,
good
people
.
 
<EOS>
Many
a
time
<EOS>
have
I
seen
the
eldest
of
them
(
she
that
had
been
maid
to
Mrs
Jamieson
)
carrying
out
some
delicate
mess
to
a
poor
person
.
 
<EOS>
They
only
aped
their
betters
in
having
"
nothing
to
do
"
with
the
class
immediately
below
theirs
.
<EOS>
And
when
Miss
Barker
died
,
their
profits
and
income
were
found
to
be
such
that
Miss
Betty
was
justified
in
shutting
up
shop
and
retiring
from
business
.
 
<EOS>
She
also
(
as
I
think
I
have
before
said
)
set
up
her
cow
;
a
mark
of
respectability
in
Cranford
almost
as
decided
as
setting
up
a
gig
is
among
some
people
.
 
<EOS>
She
dressed
finer
than
any
lady
in
Cranford
;
and
we
did
not
wonder
at
it
;
for
it
was
understood
that
she
was
wearing
out
all
the
bonnets
and
caps
and
outrageous
ribbons
which
had
once
formed
her
stock
-
in
-
trade
.
<EOS>
It
was
five
or
six
years
since
she
had
given
up
shop
,
so
in
any
other
place
than
Cranford
her
dress
might
have
been
considered
passee
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
Miss
Betty
Barker
had
called
to
invite
Miss
Matty
to
tea
at
her
house
on
the
following
Tuesday
.
 
<EOS>
She
gave
me
also
an
impromptu
invitation
,
as
I
happened
to
be
a
visitor
 
though
I
could
see
she
had
a
little
fear
lest
,
since
my
father
had
gone
to
live
in
Drumble
,
he
might
have
engaged
in
that
"
horrid
cotton
trade
,
"
and
so
dragged
his
family
down
out
of
"
aristocratic
society
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
prefaced
this
invitation
with
so
many
apologies
that
she
quite
excited
my
curiosity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Her
presumption
"
was
to
be
excused
.
 
<EOS>
What
had
she
been
doing
?
 
<EOS>
She
seemed
so
over
-
powered
by
it
<EOS>
I
could
only
think
that
she
had
been
writing
to
<EOS>
Queen
Adelaide
to
ask
for
a
receipt
for
washing
lace
;
<EOS>
but
the
act
which
she
so
characterised
was
only
an
invitation
she
had
carried
to
her
sister
's
former
mistress
,
Mrs
Jamieson
.
 
<EOS>
"
Her
former
occupation
considered
,
could
Miss
Matty
excuse
the
liberty
?
"
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
thought
<EOS>
I
,
she
has
found
out
that
double
cap
,
and
is
going
to
rectify
Miss
Matty
's
head
-
dress
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
it
was
simply
to
extend
her
invitation
to
Miss
Matty
and
to
me
.
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
bowed
acceptance
;
and
I
wondered
that
,
in
the
graceful
action
,
she
did
not
feel
the
unusual
weight
and
extraordinary
height
of
her
head
-
dress
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
do
not
think
she
did
,
for
she
recovered
her
balance
,
and
went
on
talking
to
Miss
Betty
in
a
kind
,
condescending
manner
,
very
different
from
the
fidgety
way
she
would
have
had
if
she
had
suspected
how
singular
her
appearance
was
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
is
coming
,
I
think
you
said
?
"
asked
Miss
Matty
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
most
kindly
and
condescendingly
said
she
would
be
happy
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
One
little
stipulation
she
made
,
that
she
should
bring
Carlo
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
her
that
if
I
had
a
weakness
,
it
was
for
dogs
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
Miss
Pole
?
"
questioned
Miss
Matty
,
who
was
thinking
of
her
pool
at
Preference
,
in
which
Carlo
would
not
be
available
as
a
partner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
ask
Miss
Pole
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
could
not
think
of
asking
her
until
I
had
asked
you
,
madam
 
<EOS>
the
rector
's
daughter
,
madam
.
 
<EOS>
Believe
me
,
I
do
not
forget
the
situation
my
father
held
under
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
Mrs
Forrester
,
of
course
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
Mrs
Forrester
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
,
in
fact
,
of
going
to
her
before
I
went
to
Miss
Pole
.
 
<EOS>
Although
her
circumstances
are
changed
,
madam
,
she
was
born
at
Tyrrell
,
and
we
can
never
forget
her
alliance
to
the
Bigges
,
of
Bigelow
Hall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
cared
much
more
for
the
little
circumstance
of
her
being
a
very
good
card
-
player
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
"
     
"
No
,
madam
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
draw
a
line
somewhere
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
would
not
,
I
think
,
like
to
meet
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
the
greatest
respect
for
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
 
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
think
her
fit
society
for
such
ladies
as
Mrs
Jamieson
and
Miss
Matilda
Jenkyns
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Betty
Barker
bowed
low
to
Miss
Matty
,
and
pursed
up
her
mouth
.
<EOS>
She
looked
at
me
with
sidelong
dignity
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
although
a
retired
milliner
,
she
was
no
democrat
,
and
understood
the
difference
of
ranks
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
beg
you
to
come
as
near
half
-
past
six
to
my
little
dwelling
,
as
possible
,
Miss
Matilda
?
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
dines
at
five
,
but
has
kindly
promised
not
to
delay
her
visit
beyond
that
time
 
half
-
past
six
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
with
a
swimming
curtsey
Miss
Betty
Barker
took
her
leave
.
  
<EOS>
My
prophetic
soul
foretold
a
visit
that
afternoon
from
Miss
Pole
,
who
usually
came
to
call
on
Miss
Matilda
after
any
event
 
or
indeed
in
sight
of
any
event
 
to
talk
it
over
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Betty
told
me
it
was
to
be
a
choice
and
select
few
,
"
said
Miss
Pole
,
as
she
and
Miss
Matty
compared
notes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
so
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
Not
even
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
was
the
widowed
sister
of
the
Cranford
surgeon
,
whom
I
have
named
before
.
 
<EOS>
Their
parents
were
respectable
farmers
,
content
with
their
station
.
 
<EOS>
The
name
of
these
good
people
was
Hoggins
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Hoggins
was
the
Cranford
doctor
now
;
we
disliked
the
name
and
considered
it
coarse
;
but
,
as
Miss
Jenkyns
said
,
if
he
changed
it
to
Piggins
it
would
not
be
much
better
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
hoped
to
discover
a
relationship
between
him
and
that
Marchioness
of
Exeter
whose
name
was
Molly
Hoggins
;
but
the
man
,
careless
of
his
own
interests
,
utterly
ignored
and
denied
any
such
relationship
,
although
,
as
dear
Miss
Jenkyns
had
said
,
he
had
a
sister
called
Mary
,
and
the
same
Christian
names
were
very
apt
to
run
in
families
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
Miss
Mary
Hoggins
married
Mr
Fitz
-
Adam
,
she
disappeared
from
the
neighbourhood
for
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
not
move
in
a
sphere
in
Cranford
society
sufficiently
high
to
make
any
of
us
care
to
know
what
Mr
Fitz
-
Adam
was
.
 
<EOS>
He
died
and
was
gathered
to
his
fathers
without
our
ever
having
thought
about
him
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
reappeared
in
Cranford
(
"
as
bold
as
a
lion
,
"
Miss
Pole
said
)
,
a
well
-
to
-
do
widow
,
dressed
in
rustling
black
silk
,
so
soon
after
her
husband
's
death
that
poor
Miss
Jenkyns
was
justified
in
the
remark
she
made
,
that
"
bombazine
would
have
shown
a
deeper
sense
of
her
loss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
remember
the
convocation
of
ladies
who
assembled
to
decide
whether
or
not
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
should
be
called
upon
by
the
old
blue
-
blooded
inhabitants
of
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
taken
a
large
rambling
house
,
which
had
been
usually
considered
to
confer
a
patent
of
gentility
upon
its
tenant
,
because
,
once
upon
a
time
,
seventy
or
eighty
years
before
,
the
spinster
daughter
of
an
earl
had
resided
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
sure
if
the
inhabiting
this
house
was
not
also
believed
to
convey
some
unusual
power
of
intellect
;
for
the
earl
's
daughter
,
Lady
Jane
,
had
a
sister
,
Lady
Anne
,
who
had
married
a
general
officer
in
the
time
of
the
American
war
,
and
this
general
officer
had
written
one
or
two
comedies
,
which
were
still
acted
on
the
London
boards
,
and
which
,
when
we
saw
them
advertised
,
made
us
all
draw
up
,
and
feel
that
Drury
Lane
was
paying
a
very
pretty
compliment
to
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
it
was
not
at
all
a
settled
thing
that
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
was
to
be
visited
,
when
dear
Miss
Jenkyns
died
;
and
,
with
her
,
something
of
the
clear
knowledge
of
the
strict
code
of
gentility
went
out
too
.
 
<EOS>
As
Miss
Pole
observed
,
"
As
most
of
the
ladies
of
good
family
in
Cranford
were
elderly
spinsters
,
or
widows
without
children
,
if
we
did
not
relax
a
little
,
and
become
less
exclusive
,
by
-
and
-
<EOS>
by
we
should
have
no
society
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
continued
on
the
same
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
had
always
understood
that
Fitz
meant
something
aristocratic
;
there
was
Fitz
-
Roy
 
<EOS>
she
thought
that
some
of
the
King
's
children
had
been
called
Fitz
-
Roy
;
and
there
was
Fitz
-
Clarence
<EOS>
,
now
 
they
were
the
children
of
dear
good
King
William
the
Fourth
.
 
<EOS>
Fitz
-
Adam
!
 
<EOS>
it
was
a
pretty
name
,
and
she
thought
it
very
probably
meant
"
Child
of
Adam
.
"
 
<EOS>
No
one
,
who
had
not
some
good
blood
in
their
veins
,
would
dare
to
be
called
Fitz
;
there
was
a
deal
in
a
name
 
she
had
had
<EOS>
a
cousin
who
spelt
his
name
with
two
little
ffs
 
ffoulkes
 
and
he
always
looked
down
upon
capital
letters
and
said
they
belonged
to
lately
-
invented
families
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
afraid
he
would
die
a
bachelor
<EOS>
,
he
was
so
very
choice
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
met
with
a
Mrs
ffarringdon
,
at
a
watering
-
place
,
he
took
to
her
immediately
;
and
a
very
pretty
genteel
woman
<EOS>
she
was
 
a
widow
,
with
a
very
good
fortune
;
and
"
my
cousin
,
"
Mr
ffoulkes
,
married
her
;
and
it
was
all
owing
to
her
two
little
ffs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
did
not
stand
a
chance
of
meeting
with
a
Mr
Fitz
-
anything
in
Cranford
,
so
that
could
not
have
been
her
motive
for
settling
there
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
thought
it
might
have
been
the
hope
of
being
admitted
into
the
society
of
the
place
,
which
would
certainly
be
a
very
agreeable
rise
for
ci
-
devant
Miss
Hoggins
;
and
if
this
had
been
her
hope
it
would
be
cruel
to
disappoint
her
.
  
<EOS>
So
everybody
called
upon
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
 
everybody
but
Mrs
Jamieson
,
who
used
to
show
how
honourable
she
was
by
never
seeing
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
when
they
met
at
the
Cranford
parties
.
 
<EOS>
There
would
be
only
eight
or
ten
ladies
in
the
room
,
and
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
was
the
largest
of
all
,
and
she
invariably
used
to
stand
up
when
Mrs
Jamieson
came
in
,
and
curtsey
very
low
to
her
whenever
she
turned
in
her
direction
 
so
low
,
in
fact
,
that
I
think
Mrs
Jamieson
must
have
looked
at
the
wall
above
her
,
for
she
never
moved
a
muscle
of
her
face
,
no
more
than
if
she
had
not
seen
her
.
 
<EOS>
Still
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
persevered
.
  
<EOS>
The
spring
evenings
were
getting
bright
and
long
when
three
or
four
ladies
in
calashes
met
at
Miss
Barker
's
door
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
know
what
a
calash
is
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
covering
worn
over
caps
,
not
unlike
the
heads
fastened
on
old
-
fashioned
gigs
;
but
sometimes
it
is
not
quite
so
large
.
 
<EOS>
This
kind
of
head
-
gear
always
made
an
awful
impression
on
the
children
in
Cranford
;
and
now
two
or
three
left
off
their
play
in
the
quiet
sunny
little
street
,
and
gathered
in
wondering
silence
round
Miss
Pole
,
Miss
Matty
,
and
myself
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
silent
too
,
so
that
we
could
hear
loud
,
suppressed
whispers
inside
Miss
Barker
's
house
:
 
<EOS>
"
Wait
,
Peggy
!
<EOS>
wait
till
I
've
run
upstairs
and
washed
my
hands
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
cough
,
open
the
door
;
I
'll
not
be
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
,
true
enough
it
was
not
a
minute
before
we
heard
a
noise
,
between
a
sneeze
and
a
crow
;
on
which
the
door
flew
open
.
 
<EOS>
Behind
it
stood
a
round
-
eyed
maiden
,
<EOS>
all
aghast
at
the
honourable
company
of
calashes
,
who
marched
in
without
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
She
recovered
presence
of
mind
enough
to
usher
us
into
a
small
room
,
which
had
been
the
shop
,
but
was
now
converted
into
a
temporary
dressing
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
There
we
unpinned
and
shook
ourselves
,
and
arranged
our
features
before
the
glass
into
a
sweet
and
gracious
company
-
face
;
and
then
,
bowing
backwards
with
"
After
you
,
ma'am
,
"
we
allowed
Mrs
Forrester
to
take
precedence
up
the
narrow
staircase
that
led
to
Miss
Barker
's
drawing
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
There
she
sat
,
as
stately
and
composed
as
though
we
had
never
heard
that
odd
-
sounding
cough
,
from
which
her
throat
must
have
been
even
then
sore
and
rough
.
 
<EOS>
Kind
,
gentle
,
shabbily
-
dressed
Mrs
Forrester
was
immediately
conducted
to
the
second
place
of
honour
 
a
seat
arranged
something
like
Prince
Albert
's
near
the
Queen
's
 
good
,
but
not
so
good
.
 
<EOS>
The
place
of
pre
-
eminence
was
,
of
course
,
reserved
for
the
Honourable
Mrs
Jamieson
,
who
presently
came
panting
up
the
stairs
 
<EOS>
Carlo
rushing
round
her
on
her
progress
,
as
if
he
meant
to
trip
her
up
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
Miss
Betty
Barker
was
a
proud
and
happy
woman
!
 
<EOS>
She
stirred
the
fire
,
and
shut
the
door
,
and
sat
as
near
to
it
as
she
could
,
quite
on
the
edge
of
her
chair
.
 
<EOS>
When
Peggy
came
in
,
tottering
under
the
weight
of
the
tea
-
tray
,
I
noticed
that
Miss
Barker
was
sadly
afraid
lest
Peggy
should
not
keep
her
distance
sufficiently
.
<EOS>
She
and
her
mistress
were
on
very
familiar
terms
in
their
every
-
day
intercourse
,
and
Peggy
wanted
now
to
make
several
little
confidences
to
her
,
which
Miss
Barker
was
on
thorns
to
hear
,
but
which
she
thought
it
her
duty
,
as
a
lady
,
to
repress
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
turned
away
from
all
Peggy
's
asides
and
signs
;
but
she
made
one
or
two
very
malapropos
answers
to
what
was
said
;
and
at
last
<EOS>
,
seized
with
a
bright
idea
,
she
exclaimed
,
"
Poor
,
sweet
Carlo
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
forgetting
him
.
 
<EOS>
Come
downstairs
with
me
,
poor
ittie
doggie
,
and
it
shall
have
its
tea
,
it
shall
!
"
  
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
she
returned
,
bland
and
benignant
as
before
;
but
I
thought
she
had
forgotten
to
give
the
"
poor
ittie
doggie
"
anything
to
eat
,
judging
by
the
avidity
with
which
he
swallowed
down
chance
pieces
of
cake
.
 
<EOS>
The
tea
-
tray
was
abundantly
loaded
 
<EOS>
I
was
pleased
to
see
it
<EOS>
,
I
was
so
hungry
;
but
I
was
afraid
the
ladies
present
might
think
it
vulgarly
heaped
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
they
would
have
done
at
their
own
houses
;
but
somehow
the
heaps
disappeared
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
Mrs
Jamieson
eating
seed
-
cake
,
slowly
and
considerately
,
as
she
did
everything
;
and
I
was
rather
surprised
,
for
I
knew
she
had
told
us
,
on
the
occasion
of
her
last
party
,
that
she
never
had
it
in
her
house
<EOS>
,
it
reminded
her
so
much
of
scented
soap
.
 
<EOS>
She
always
gave
us
Savoy
biscuits
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
Mrs
Jamieson
was
kindly
indulgent
to
Miss
Barker
's
want
of
knowledge
of
the
customs
of
high
life
;
and
,
to
spare
her
feelings
,
ate
three
large
pieces
of
seed
-
cake
,
with
a
placid
,
ruminating
expression
of
countenance
,
not
unlike
a
cow
's
.
  
<EOS>
After
tea
there
was
some
little
demur
and
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
six
in
number
;
four
could
play
at
Preference
,
and
for
the
other
two
there
was
Cribbage
.
 
<EOS>
But
all
,
except
myself
(
I
was
rather
afraid
of
the
Cranford
ladies
at
cards
,
for
it
was
the
most
earnest
and
serious
business
they
ever
engaged
in
)
,
were
anxious
to
be
of
the
"
pool
.
"
 
<EOS>
Even
Miss
Barker
,
while
declaring
she
did
not
know
Spadille
from
Manille
,
was
evidently
hankering
to
take
a
hand
.
 
<EOS>
The
dilemma
was
soon
put
an
end
to
by
a
singular
kind
of
noise
.
 
<EOS>
If
a
baron
's
daughter
-
in
-
law
could
ever
be
supposed
to
snore
,
I
should
have
said
Mrs
Jamieson
did
so
then
;
for
,
overcome
by
the
heat
of
the
room
,
and
inclined
to
doze
by
nature
,
the
temptation
of
that
very
comfortable
arm
-
chair
had
been
too
much
for
her
,
and
Mrs
Jamieson
was
nodding
.
 
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
she
opened
her
eyes
with
an
effort
,
and
calmly
but
unconsciously
smiled
upon
us
;
but
by
-
and
-
by
,
even
her
benevolence
was
not
equal
to
this
exertion
,
and
she
was
sound
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
gratifying
to
me
,
"
whispered
Miss
Barker
at
the
card
-
table
to
her
three
opponents
,
whom
,
notwithstanding
her
ignorance
of
the
game
,
she
was
"
basting
"
most
unmercifully
 
"
very
gratifying
indeed
,
to
see
how
completely
Mrs
Jamieson
feels
at
home
in
my
poor
little
dwelling
;
she
could
not
have
paid
me
a
greater
compliment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Barker
provided
me
with
some
literature
in
the
shape
of
three
or
four
handsomely
-
bound
fashion
-
books
ten
or
twelve
years
old
,
observing
,
as
she
put
a
little
table
and
a
candle
for
my
especial
benefit
,
that
she
knew
young
people
liked
to
look
at
pictures
.
<EOS>
Carlo
lay
and
snorted
,
and
started
at
his
mistress
's
feet
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
was
quite
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
The
card
-
table
was
an
animated
scene
to
watch
;
four
ladies
'
heads
,
with
niddle
-
noddling
caps
,
all
nearly
meeting
over
the
middle
of
the
table
in
their
eagerness
to
whisper
quick
enough
and
loud
enough
:
 
and
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
came
Miss
Barker
's
"
Hush
,
ladies
!
<EOS>
if
you
please
,
hush
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
is
asleep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
very
difficult
to
steer
clear
between
Mrs
Forrester
's
deafness
and
Mrs
Jamieson
's
sleepiness
.
 
<EOS>
But
Miss
Barker
managed
her
arduous
task
well
.
 
<EOS>
She
repeated
the
whisper
to
Mrs
Forrester
,
distorting
her
face
considerably
,
in
order
to
show
,
by
the
motions
of
her
lips
,
what
was
said
;
and
then
she
smiled
kindly
all
round
at
us
,
and
murmured
to
herself
,
"
Very
gratifying
,
indeed
<EOS>
;
I
wish
my
poor
sister
had
been
alive
to
see
this
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
Presently
the
door
was
thrown
wide
open
;
Carlo
started
to
his
feet
,
with
a
loud
snapping
bark
,
and
Mrs
Jamieson
awoke
:
 
or
,
perhaps
,
she
had
not
been
asleep
 
as
she
said
almost
directly
,
the
room
had
been
so
light
she
had
been
glad
to
keep
her
eyes
shut
,
but
had
been
listening
with
great
interest
to
all
our
amusing
and
agreeable
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
Peggy
came
in
once
more
,
red
with
importance
.
<EOS>
Another
tray
!
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
gentility
!
"
<EOS>
thought
I
,
"
can
yon
endure
this
last
shock
?
"
 
<EOS>
For
Miss
Barker
had
ordered
(
nay
,
I
doubt
not
,
prepared
,
although
she
did
say
,
"
Why
,
Peggy
,
what
have
you
brought
us
?
"
and
looked
pleasantly
surprised
at
the
unexpected
pleasure
)
<EOS>
all
sorts
of
good
things
for
supper
 
scalloped
oysters
,
potted
lobsters
,
jelly
,
a
dish
called
"
little
Cupids
"
(
which
was
in
great
favour
with
the
Cranford
ladies
,
although
too
expensive
to
be
given
,
except
on
solemn
and
state
occasions
 
macaroons
sopped
in
brandy
,
I
should
have
called
it
,
if
I
had
not
known
its
more
refined
and
classical
name
)
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
we
were
evidently
to
be
feasted
with
all
that
was
sweetest
and
best
;
and
we
thought
it
better
to
submit
graciously
,
even
at
the
cost
of
our
gentility
 
which
never
ate
suppers
in
general
,
but
which
,
like
most
non-
supper
-
eaters
,
was
particularly
hungry
on
all
special
occasions
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Barker
,
in
her
former
sphere
,
had
,
I
daresay
,
been
made
acquainted
with
the
beverage
they
call
cherry
-
brandy
.
 
<EOS>
We
none
of
us
had
ever
seen
such
a
thing
,
and
rather
shrank
back
when
she
proffered
it
<EOS>
us
 
<EOS>
"
just
a
little
,
leetle
glass
,
ladies
;
after
the
oysters
and
lobsters
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Shell
-
fish
are
sometimes
thought
not
very
wholesome
.
"
 
<EOS>
We
all
shook
our
heads
like
female
mandarins
;
but
,
at
last
,
Mrs
Jamieson
suffered
herself
to
be
persuaded
,
and
we
followed
her
lead
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
exactly
unpalatable
,
though
so
hot
and
so
strong
<EOS>
that
we
thought
ourselves
bound
to
give
evidence
that
we
were
not
accustomed
to
such
things
by
coughing
terribly
 
almost
as
strangely
as
Miss
Barker
had
done
,
before
we
were
admitted
by
Peggy
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
strong
,
"
said
Miss
Pole
,
as
she
put
down
her
empty
glass
;
"
I
do
believe
there
's
spirit
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
a
little
drop
 
just
necessary
to
make
it
keep
,
"
said
Miss
Barker
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
we
put
brandy
-
pepper
over
our
preserves
to
make
them
keep
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
feel
tipsy
myself
from
eating
damson
tart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
question
whether
damson
tart
would
have
opened
Mrs
Jamieson
's
heart
as
the
cherry
-
brandy
did
;
but
she
told
us
of
a
coming
event
,
respecting
which
she
had
been
quite
silent
till
that
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
sister
-
in
-
law
,
Lady
Glenmire
,
is
coming
to
stay
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
chorus
of
"
Indeed
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
a
pause
.
 
<EOS>
Each
one
rapidly
reviewed
her
wardrobe
,
as
to
its
fitness
to
appear
in
the
presence
of
a
baron
's
widow
;
for
,
of
course
,
a
series
of
small
festivals
were
always
held
in
Cranford
on
the
arrival
of
a
visitor
at
any
of
our
friends
'
houses
.
 
<EOS>
We
felt
very
pleasantly
excited
on
the
present
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Not
long
after
this
the
maids
and
the
lanterns
were
announced
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
had
the
sedan
-
chair
,
which
had
squeezed
itself
into
Miss
Barker
's
narrow
lobby
with
some
difficulty
,
and
most
literally
"
stopped
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
required
some
skilful
manoeuvring
on
the
part
of
the
old
chairmen
(
shoemakers
by
day
,
but
when
summoned
to
carry
the
sedan
dressed
up
in
a
strange
old
livery
 
long
great
-
coats
,
with
small
capes
,
coeval
with
the
sedan
,
and
similar
to
the
dress
of
the
class
in
Hogarth
's
pictures
)
to
edge
,
and
back
,
and
try
at
it
again
,
and
finally
to
succeed
in
carrying
their
burden
out
of
Miss
Barker
's
front
door
.
 
<EOS>
Then
we
heard
<EOS>
their
quick
pit
-
a-
pat
along
the
quiet
little
street
as
we
put
on
our
calashes
and
pinned
up
our
gowns
;
Miss
Barker
hovering
about
us
with
offers
of
help
,
which
,
if
she
had
not
remembered
her
former
occupation
,
and
wished
us
to
forget
it
,
would
have
been
much
more
pressing
.
   
<EOS>
"
YOUR
LADYSHIP
"
 
Early
the
next
morning
 
directly
after
twelve
 
Miss
Pole
made
her
appearance
at
Miss
Matty
's
.
 
<EOS>
Some
very
trifling
piece
of
business
was
alleged
as
a
reason
for
the
call
;
but
there
was
evidently
something
behind
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
out
it
came
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
the
way
,
you
'll
think
I
'm
strangely
ignorant
;
but
,
do
you
really
know
,
I
am
puzzled
how
we
ought
to
address
Lady
Glenmire
.
<EOS>
Do
you
say
,
"
Your
Ladyship
,
"
where
you
would
say
"
you
"
to
a
common
person
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
puzzling
all
morning
;
and
are
we
to
say
"
My
Lady
,
"
instead
of
"
Ma'am
?
"
 
<EOS>
Now
you
knew
Lady
Arley
 
<EOS>
will
you
kindly
tell
me
the
most
correct
way
of
speaking
to
the
peerage
?
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Miss
Matty
!
<EOS>
she
took
off
her
spectacles
and
she
put
them
on
again
 
<EOS>
but
how
Lady
Arley
was
addressed
,
she
could
not
remember
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
long
ago
,
"
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
!
<EOS>
dear
!
<EOS>
how
stupid
I
am
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
ever
saw
her
more
than
twice
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
we
used
to
call
Sir
Peter
,
"
Sir
Peter
"
 
b
<EOS>
ut
<EOS>
he
came
much
oftener
to
see
us
than
Lady
Arley
did
.
 
<EOS>
Deborah
would
have
known
in
a
minute
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
lady
'
  
"
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
sounds
very
strange
,
and
as
if
it
was
not
natural
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
thought
of
it
before
;
but
,
now
you
have
named
it
,
I
am
all
in
a
puzzle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
very
certain
Miss
Pole
would
obtain
no
wise
decision
from
Miss
Matty
,
who
got
more
bewildered
every
moment
,
and
more
perplexed
as
to
etiquettes
of
address
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
really
think
,
"
said
Miss
Pole
,
"
I
had
better
just
go
and
tell
Mrs
Forrester
about
our
little
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
One
sometimes
grows
nervous
;
and
yet
one
would
not
have
<EOS>
Lady
Glenmire
think
we
were
quite
ignorant
of
the
etiquettes
of
high
life
in
Cranford
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
will
you
just
step
in
here
,
dear
Miss
Pole
,
as
you
come
back
,
please
,
and
tell
me
what
you
decide
upon
?
 
<EOS>
Whatever
you
and
Mrs
Forrester
fix
upon
,
will
be
quite
right
,
I
'm
sure
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lady
Arley
,
"
"
Sir
Peter
,
"
said
Miss
Matty
to
herself
,
trying
to
recall
the
old
forms
of
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
Lady
Glenmire
?
"
asked
I.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
she
's
the
widow
of
Mr
Jamieson
 
<EOS>
that
's
Mrs
Jamieson
's
late
husband
<EOS>
,
you
know
 
widow
of
his
eldest
brother
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
was
a
Miss
Walker
,
daughter
of
Governor
Walker
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
ladyship
.
"
 
<EOS>
My
dear
,
if
they
fix
on
that
way
of
speaking
,
you
must
just
let
me
practice
a
little
on
you
first
,
for
I
shall
feel
so
foolish
and
hot
saying
it
the
first
time
to
Lady
Glenmire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
really
a
relief
to
Miss
Matty
when
Mrs
Jamieson
came
on
a
very
unpolite
errand
.
 
<EOS>
I
notice
that
apathetic
people
have
more
quiet
impertinence
than
others
;
and
Mrs
Jamieson
came
now
to
insinuate
pretty
plainly
that
she
did
not
particularly
wish
that
the
Cranford
ladies
should
call
upon
her
sister
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
say
how
she
made
this
clear
;
for
I
grew
very
indignant
and
warm
,
while
with
slow
deliberation
she
was
explaining
her
wishes
to
Miss
Matty
,
who
,
a
true
lady
herself
,
could
hardly
understand
the
feeling
which
made
Mrs
Jamieson
wish
to
appear
to
her
noble
sister-
in
-
law
as
if
she
only
visited
"
county
"
families
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
remained
puzzled
and
perplexed
long
after
I
had
found
out
the
object
of
Mrs
Jamieson
's
visit
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
did
understand
the
drift
of
the
honourable
lady
's
call
,
it
was
pretty
to
see
with
what
quiet
dignity
<EOS>
she
received
the
intimation
thus
uncourteously
given
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
not
in
the
least
hurt
 
<EOS>
she
was
of
too
gentle
a
spirit
for
that
;
nor
was
she
exactly
conscious
of
disapproving
of
Mrs
Jamieson
's
conduct
;
but
there
was
something
of
this
feeling
in
her
mind
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
,
which
made
her
pass
from
the
subject
to
others
in
a
less
flurried
and
more
composed
manner
than
usual
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
was
,
indeed
,
the
more
flurried
of
the
two
,
and
I
could
see
she
was
glad
to
take
her
leave
.
  
<EOS>
A
little
while
afterwards
Miss
Pole
returned
,
red
and
indignant
.
"
<EOS>
Well
!
to
be
sure
!
 
<EOS>
You
've
had
Mrs
Jamieson
here
<EOS>
,
I
find
from
Martha
;
and
we
are
not
to
call
on
Lady
Glenmire
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
!
 
<EOS>
I
met
Mrs
Jamieson
,
half
-
way
between
<EOS>
here
and
Mrs
Forrester
's
,
and
<EOS>
she
told
me
;
she
took
me
so
by
surprise
,
I
had
nothing
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
thought
of
something
very
sharp
and
sarcastic
;
I
dare
say
I
shall
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
And
Lady
Glenmire
is
<EOS>
but
the
widow
of
a
Scotch
baron
after
all
!
 
<EOS>
I
went
on
to
look
at
Mrs
Forrester
's
Peerage
,
to
see
who
this
lady
was
,
that
is
to
be
kept
under
a
glass
case
:
 
widow
of
a
Scotch
peer
 
never
sat
in
the
House
of
Lords
 
and
as
poor
as
job
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
;
and
she
 
fifth
daughter
of
some
Mr
Campbell
or
other
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
daughter
of
a
rector
,
at
any
rate
,
and
related
to
the
Arleys
;
and
Sir
Peter
might
have
been
Viscount
Arley
,
every
one
says
.
<EOS>
"
  
Miss
Matty
tried
to
soothe
Miss
Pole
,
but
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
That
lady
,
usually
so
kind
and
good
-
humoured
,
was
now
in
a
full
flow
of
anger
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
went
and
ordered
a
cap
this
morning
,
to
be
quite
ready
,
"
said
she
at
last
,
letting
out
the
secret
which
gave
sting
to
Mrs
Jamieson
's
intimation
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Jamieson
shall
see
if
it
is
so
easy
to
get
me
to
make
fourth
at
a
pool
when
she
has
none
of
her
fine
Scotch
relations
with
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
In
coming
out
of
church
,
the
first
Sunday
on
which
Lady
Glenmire
appeared
in
Cranford
,
we
sedulously
talked
together
,
and
turned
our
backs
on
Mrs
Jamieson
and
her
guest
.
 
<EOS>
If
we
might
not
call
on
her
,
we
would
not
even
look
at
her
,
though
we
were
dying
with
curiosity
to
know
what
she
was
like
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
the
comfort
of
questioning
Martha
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
Martha
did
not
belong
to
a
sphere
of
society
whose
observation
could
be
an
implied
compliment
to
Lady
Glenmire
,
and
Martha
had
made
good
use
of
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
ma'am
!
<EOS>
is
it
the
little
lady
with
Mrs
Jamieson
,
you
mean
?
 
<EOS>
I
thought
you
would
like
more
to
know
how
young
Mrs
Smith
was
dressed
;
her
being
a
bride
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
Mrs
Smith
was
the
butcher
's
wife
)
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
said
,
"
Good
gracious
me
!
<EOS>
as
if
we
cared
about
a
Mrs
Smith
;
"
but
was
silent
as
Martha
resumed
her
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
little
lady
in
Mrs
Jamieson
's
pew
had
on
,
ma'am
,
rather
an
old
black
silk
,
and
a
shepherd
's
plaid
cloak
,
ma'am
,
and
very
bright
<EOS>
black
eyes
<EOS>
she
had
,
ma'am
,
and
a
pleasant
,
sharp
face
;
not
over
young
,
ma'am
,
but
<EOS>
yet
,
I
should
guess
,
younger
than
Mrs
Jamieson
herself
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
up
and
down
the
church
,
like
a
bird
,
and
nipped
up
her
petticoats
,
when
she
came
out
,
as
quick
and
sharp
as
ever
<EOS>
I
see
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
ma'am
,
she
's
more
like
Mrs
Deacon
,
at
the
"
Coach
and
Horses
,
"
nor
any
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
Martha
!
"
said
Miss
Matty
,
"
that
's
not
respectful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
it
,
ma'am
?
 
<EOS>
I
beg
pardon
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
;
but
Jem
Hearn
said
so
as
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
she
was
just
<EOS>
such
a
sharp
,
stirring
sort
of
a
body
"
     
"
Lady
,
"
said
Miss
Pole
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
 
as
Mrs
Deacon
.
"
  
<EOS>
Another
Sunday
passed
away
,
and
we
still
averted
our
eyes
from
Mrs
Jamieson
and
her
guest
,
and
made
remarks
to
ourselves
that
we
thought
were
very
severe
 
almost
too
much
so
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
was
evidently
uneasy
at
our
sarcastic
manner
of
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
by
this
time
Lady
Glenmire
had
found
out
that
Mrs
Jamieson
's
was
not
the
gayest
,
liveliest
house
in
the
world
;
perhaps
Mrs
Jamieson
had
found
out
that
most
of
the
county
families
were
in
London
,
and
that
those
who
remained
in
the
country
were
not
so
alive
as
they
might
have
been
to
the
circumstance
of
Lady
Glenmire
being
in
their
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
Great
events
spring
out
of
small
causes
<EOS>
;
so
I
will
not
pretend
to
say
what
induced
Mrs
Jamieson
to
alter
her
determination
of
excluding
the
Cranford
ladies
,
and
send
notes
of
invitation
<EOS>
all
round
for
a
small
party
on
the
following
Tuesday
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Mulliner
himself
brought
them
round
.
 
<EOS>
He
WOULD
always
ignore
the
fact
of
there
being
a
back
-
door
to
any
house
,
and
gave
a
louder
rat
-
tat
than
his
mistress
,
Mrs
Jamieson
.
<EOS>
He
had
three
little
notes
,
which
he
carried
in
a
large
basket
,
in
order
to
impress
his
mistress
with
an
idea
of
their
great
weight
,
though
they
might
easily
have
gone
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
and
I
quietly
decided
that
we
would
have
a
previous
engagement
at
home
:
 
<EOS>
it
was
the
evening
on
which
Miss
Matty
usually
made
candle
-
lighters
of
all
the
notes
and
letters
of
the
week
;
for
on
Mondays
her
accounts
were
always
made
straight
 
not
a
penny
owing
from
the
week
before
;
so
,
by
a
natural
arrangement
,
making
candle
-
lighters
fell
upon
a
Tuesday
evening
,
and
gave
us
a
legitimate
excuse
for
declining
Mrs
Jamieson
's
invitation
.
 
<EOS>
But
before
our
answer
was
written
,
in
came
Miss
Pole
,
with
an
open
note
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
!
"
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
you
have
got
your
note
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
Better
late
than
never
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
told
my
Lady
Glenmire
she
would
be
glad
enough
of
our
society
before
a
fortnight
was
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Miss
Matty
,
"
we
're
asked
for
Tuesday
evening
.
 
<EOS>
And
perhaps
you
would
just
kindly
bring
your
work
across
and
drink
tea
with
us
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
my
usual
regular
time
for
looking
over
the
last
week
's
bills
,
and
notes
,
and
letters
,
and
making
candle
-
lighters
of
them
;
but
that
does
not
seem
quite
reason
enough
for
saying
I
have
a
previous
engagement
at
home
,
though
I
meant
to
make
it
do
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
if
you
would
come
,
my
conscience
would
be
quite
at
ease
,
and
luckily
the
note
is
not
written
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
saw
Miss
Pole
's
countenance
change
while
Miss
Matty
was
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
mean
to
go
then
?
"
asked
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
!
"
said
,
Miss
Matty
quietly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
either
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
replied
Miss
Pole
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
think
I
do
,
"
said
she
,
rather
briskly
;
<EOS>
and
on
seeing
Miss
Matty
look
surprised
,
she
added
,
"
You
see
,
one
would
not
like
Mrs
Jamieson
to
think
that
anything
she
could
do
,
or
say
,
was
of
consequence
enough
to
give
offence
;
it
would
be
a
kind
of
letting
down
of
ourselves
,
that
I
,
for
one
,
should
not
like
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
too
flattering
to
Mrs
Jamieson
if
we
allowed
her
to
suppose
that
what
she
had
said
affected
us
a
week
,
nay
ten
days
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
is
wrong
to
be
hurt
and
annoyed
so
long
about
anything
;
and
,
perhaps
,
after
all
,
she
did
not
mean
to
vex
us
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
must
say
,
I
could
not
have
brought
myself
to
say
the
things
Mrs
Jamieson
did
about
our
not
calling
.
 
<EOS>
I
really
do
n't
think
I
shall
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
come
!
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
,
you
must
go
;
you
know
our
friend
Mrs
Jamieson
is
much
more
phlegmatic
than
most
people
,
and
does
not
enter
into
the
little
delicacies
of
feeling
which
you
possess
in
so
remarkable
a
degree
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
possessed
them
,
too
,
<EOS>
that
day
Mrs
Jamieson
called
to
tell
us
not
to
go
,
"
said
Miss
Matty
innocently
.
  
<EOS>
But
Miss
Pole
,
in
addition
to
her
delicacies
of
feeling
,
possessed
a
very
smart
cap
,
which
she
was
anxious
to
show
to
an
admiring
world
;
and
so
she
seemed
to
forget
all
her
angry
words
uttered
not
a
fortnight
before
,
and
to
be
ready
to
act
on
what
she
called
the
great
Christian
principle
of
"
Forgive
and
forget
"
;
and
she
lectured
dear
Miss
Matty
so
long
on
this
head
that
she
absolutely
ended
by
assuring
her
it
was
her
duty
,
as
a
deceased
rector
's
daughter
,
to
buy
a
new
cap
and
go
to
the
party
at
Mrs
Jamieson
's
.
 
<EOS>
So
"
we
were
most
happy
to
accept
,
"
instead
of
"
regretting
that
we
were
obliged
to
decline
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
expenditure
on
dress
in
Cranford
was
principally
in
that
one
article
referred
to
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
heads
were
buried
in
smart
new
caps
,
the
ladies
were
like
ostriches
,
and
cared
not
what
became
of
their
bodies
.
 
<EOS>
Old
gowns
,
white
and
venerable
collars
,
any
number
of
brooches
,
up
and
down
and
everywhere
(
some
with
dogs
'
eyes
painted
in
them
;
some
that
were
like
small
picture
-
frames
with
mausoleums
and
weeping
-
willows
neatly
executed
in
hair
inside
;
some
,
again
,
with
miniatures
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
sweetly
smiling
out
of
a
nest
of
stiff
muslin
)
,
old
brooches
for
a
permanent
ornament
,
and
new
caps
to
suit
the
fashion
of
the
day
 
the
ladies
of
Cranford
always
dressed
with
chaste
elegance
and
propriety
,
as
Miss
Barker
once
prettily
expressed
it
.
  
<EOS>
And
with
three
new
caps
,
and
a
greater
array
of
brooches
than
had
ever
been
seen
together
at
one
time
since
Cranford
was
a
town
,
did
Mrs
Forrester
,
and
Miss
Matty
,
and
Miss
Pole
appear
on
that
memorable
Tuesday
evening
.
 
<EOS>
I
counted
seven
brooches
myself
on
Miss
Pole
's
dress
.
 
<EOS>
Two
were
fixed
negligently
in
her
cap
<EOS>
(
one
was
a
butterfly
made
of
Scotch
pebbles
,
which
a
vivid
imagination
might
believe
to
be
the
real
insect
)
;
one
fastened
her
net
neckerchief
;
one
her
collar
;
one
ornamented
the
front
of
her
gown
,
midway
between
her
throat
and
waist
;
and
another
adorned
the
point
of
her
stomacher
.
 
<EOS>
Where
the
seventh
was
I
have
forgotten
,
but
it
was
somewhere
about
her
,
I
am
sure
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
am
getting
on
too
fast
,
in
describing
the
dresses
of
the
company
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
first
relate
the
gathering
on
the
way
to
Mrs
Jamieson
's
.
 
<EOS>
That
lady
lived
in
a
large
house
just
outside
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
A
road
which
had
known
what
it
was
to
be
a
street
ran
right
before
the
house
,
which
opened
out
upon
it
without
any
intervening
garden
or
court
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
the
sun
was
about
,
he
never
shone
on
the
front
of
that
house
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
the
living
-
rooms
were
at
the
back
,
looking
on
to
a
pleasant
garden
;
the
front
windows
only
belonged
to
kitchens
and
housekeepers
'
rooms
,
and
pantries
,
and
in
one
of
them
<EOS>
Mr
Mulliner
was
reported
to
sit
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
looking
askance
,
we
often
saw
the
back
of
a
head
covered
with
hair
powder
,
which
also
extended
itself
over
his
coat
-
collar
down
to
his
very
waist
;
and
this
imposing
back
was
always
engaged
in
reading
the
St
James
's
Chronicle
,
opened
wide
,
which
,
in
some
degree
,
accounted
for
the
length
of
time
the
said
newspaper
was
in
reaching
us
 
equal
subscribers
with
Mrs
Jamieson
,
though
,
in
right
of
her
honourableness
,
she
always
had
the
reading
of
it
first
.
 
<EOS>
This
very
Tuesday
,
the
delay
in
forwarding
the
last
number
had
been
particularly
aggravating
;
just
when
both
Miss
Pole
and
Miss
Matty
,
the
former
more
especially
,
had
been
wanting
to
see
it
,
in
order
to
coach
up
the
Court
news
ready
for
the
evening
's
interview
with
aristocracy
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
told
us
she
had
absolutely
taken
time
by
the
forelock
,
and
been
dressed
by
five
o'clock
,
in
order
to
be
ready
if
the
St
James
's
Chronicle
should
come
in
at
the
last
moment
 
the
very
St
James
's
Chronicle
which
the
powdered
head
was
tranquilly
and
composedly
reading
as
we
passed
the
accustomed
window
this
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
impudence
of
the
man
!
"
said
Miss
Pole
,
in
a
low
indignant
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
ask
him
whether
his
mistress
pays
her
quarter
-
share
for
his
exclusive
use
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
looked
at
her
in
admiration
of
the
courage
of
her
thought
;
for
Mr
Mulliner
was
an
object
of
great
awe
to
all
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
never
to
have
forgotten
his
condescension
in
coming
to
live
at
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
,
at
times
,
had
stood
forth
as
the
undaunted
champion
of
her
sex
,
and
spoken
to
him
on
terms
of
equality
;
but
even
Miss
Jenkyns
could
get
no
higher
.
 
<EOS>
In
his
pleasantest
and
most
gracious
moods
he
looked
like
a
sulky
cockatoo
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
speak
except
in
gruff
monosyllables
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
wait
in
the
hall
when
we
begged
him
not
to
wait
,
and
then
look
deeply
offended
because
we
had
kept
him
there
,
while
,
with
trembling
,
hasty
hands
we
prepared
ourselves
for
appearing
in
company
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
ventured
on
a
small
joke
as
we
went
upstairs
,
intended
,
though
addressed
to
us
,
to
afford
Mr
Mulliner
some
slight
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
smiled
,
in
order
to
seem
as
if
we
felt
at
our
ease
,
and
timidly
looked
for
Mr
Mulliner
's
sympathy
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
muscle
of
that
wooden
face
had
relaxed
;
and
we
were
grave
in
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
's
drawing
-
room
was
cheerful
;
the
evening
sun
came
streaming
into
it
,
and
the
large
square
window
was
clustered
round
with
flowers
.
 
<EOS>
The
furniture
was
white
and
gold
;
not
the
later
style
,
Louis
Quatorze
<EOS>
,
I
think
they
call
it

all
shells

twirls
;
<EOS>
no
,
Mrs
Jamieson
's
chairs
and
tables
had
not
a
curve
or
bend
about
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
chair
and
table
legs
diminished
as
they
neared
the
ground
,
and
were
straight
and
square
in
all
their
corners
.
 
<EOS>
The
chairs
were
all
a
-
row
against
the
walls
,
with
the
exception
of
four
or
five
which
stood
in
a
circle
round
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
railed
with
white
bars
across
the
back
and
knobbed
with
gold
;
neither
the
railings
nor
the
knobs
invited
to
ease
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
japanned
table
devoted
to
literature
,
on
which
lay
a
Bible
,
a
Peerage
,
and
a
Prayer
-
Book
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
another
square
Pembroke
table
dedicated
to
the
Fine
Arts
,
on
which
were
a
kaleidoscope
,
conversation
-
cards
,
puzzle
-
cards
(
tied
together
to
an
interminable
length
with
faded
pink
satin
ribbon
)
,
and
a
box
painted
in
fond
imitation
of
the
drawings
which
decorate
tea
-
chests
.
 
<EOS>
Carlo
lay
on
the
worsted
-
worked
rug
,
and
ungraciously
barked
at
us
as
we
entered
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
stood
up
,
giving
us
each
a
torpid
smile
of
welcome
,
and
looking
helplessly
beyond
us
at
Mr
Mulliner
,
as
if
she
hoped
he
would
place
us
in
chairs
,
for
,
if
he
did
not
,
she
never
could
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
thought
we
could
find
our
way
to
the
circle
round
the
fire
,
which
reminded
me
of
Stonehenge
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
know
why
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Glenmire
came
to
the
rescue
of
our
hostess
,
and
,
somehow
or
other
,
we
found
ourselves
for
the
first
time
placed
agreeably
,
and
not
formally
,
in
Mrs
Jamieson
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Glenmire
,
now
we
had
time
to
look
at
her
,
proved
to
be
a
bright
little
woman
of
middle
age
,
who
had
been
very
pretty
in
the
days
of
her
youth
,
and
who
was
even
yet
very
pleasant
-
looking
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
Miss
Pole
appraising
her
dress
in
the
first
five
minutes
,
and
I
take
her
word
when
she
said
the
next
day
     
<EOS>
"
My
dear
!
<EOS>
ten
pounds
would
have
purchased
every
stitch
she
had
on
 
lace
and
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
pleasant
to
suspect
that
a
peeress
could
be
poor
,
and
partly
reconciled
us
to
the
fact
that
her
husband
had
never
sat
in
the
House
of
Lords
;
which
,
when
we
first
heard
of
it
,
seemed
a
kind
of
swindling
us
out
of
our
prospects
on
false
pretences
;
a
sort
of
"
A
Lord
and
No
Lord
"
business
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
all
very
silent
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
thinking
what
we
could
talk
about
,
that
should
be
high
enough
to
interest
My
Lady
.
 
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
rise
in
the
price
of
sugar
,
which
,
as
preserving
-
time
was
near
,
was
a
piece
of
intelligence
to
all
our
house
-
keeping
hearts
,
and
would
have
been
the
natural
topic
if
Lady
Glenmire
had
not
been
by
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
were
not
sure
if
the
peerage
ate
preserves
 
much
less
knew
how
they
were
made
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
Miss
Pole
,
who
had
always
a
great
deal
of
courage
and
savoir
faire
,
spoke
to
Lady
Glenmire
,
who
on
her
part
had
seemed
just
as
much
puzzled
to
know
how
to
break
the
silence
as
we
were
.
  
<EOS>
"
Has
your
ladyship
been
to
Court
lately
?
"
<EOS>
asked
she
;
and
then
gave
a
little
glance
round
at
us
,
half
timid
and
half
triumphant
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
<EOS>
See
how
judiciously
I
have
chosen
a
subject
befitting
the
rank
of
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
was
there
in
my
life
,
"
said
Lady
Glenmire
,
with
a
broad
Scotch
accent
,
but
in
a
very
sweet
voice
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
,
as
if
she
had
been
too
abrupt
,
she
added
:
 
<EOS>
"
We
very
seldom
went
to
London
 
only
twice
,
in
fact
,
during
all
my
married
life
;
and
before
I
was
married
my
father
had
far
too
large
a
family
"
(
fifth
daughter
of
Mr
Campbell
was
in
all
our
minds
,
I
am
sure
)
"
to
take
us
often
from
our
home
,
even
to
Edinburgh
.
 
<EOS>
Ye'll
have
been
in
Edinburgh
,
maybe
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
suddenly
brightening
up
with
the
hope
of
a
common
interest
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
none
of
us
been
there
;
but
Miss
Pole
had
an
uncle
who
once
had
passed
a
night
there
,
which
was
very
pleasant
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
,
meanwhile
,
was
absorbed
in
wonder
why
Mr
Mulliner
did
not
bring
the
tea
;
and
at
length
the
wonder
oozed
out
of
her
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
better
ring
the
bell
,
my
dear
,
had
not
I
?
"
said
Lady
Glenmire
briskly
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
I
think
not
 
Mulliner
does
not
like
to
be
hurried
.
<EOS>
"
  
We
should
have
liked
our
tea
,
for
we
dined
at
an
earlier
hour
than
Mrs
Jamieson
.
 
<EOS>
I
suspect
Mr
Mulliner
had
to
finish
the
St
James
's
Chronicle
before
he
chose
to
trouble
himself
about
tea
.
 
<EOS>
His
mistress
fidgeted
and
fidgeted
,
and
kept
saying
<EOS>
,
I
ca
n't
think
why
Mulliner
does
not
bring
tea
.
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
think
what
he
can
be
about
.
"
<EOS>
And
Lady
Glenmire
at
last
grew
quite
impatient
,
but
it
was
a
pretty
kind
of
impatience
after
all
;
and
she
rang
the
bell
rather
sharply
,
on
receiving
a
half
-
permission
from
her
sister
-
in
-
law
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Mulliner
appeared
in
dignified
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Mrs
Jamieson
,
"
Lady
Glenmire
rang
the
bell
<EOS>
;
I
believe
it
was
for
tea
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
tea
was
brought
.
 
<EOS>
Very
delicate
was
the
china
,
very
old
<EOS>
the
plate
,
very
thin
the
bread
and
butter
,
and
very
small
the
lumps
of
sugar
.
 
<EOS>
Sugar
was
evidently
Mrs
Jamieson
's
favourite
economy
.
 
<EOS>
I
question
if
the
little
filigree
sugar
-
tongs
,
made
something
like
scissors
,
could
have
opened
themselves
wide
enough
to
take
up
an
honest
,
vulgar
good
-
sized
piece
;
and
when
I
tried
to
seize
two
little
minnikin
pieces
at
once
,
so
as
not
to
be
detected
in
too
many
returns
to
the
sugar
-
basin
,
they
absolutely
dropped
one
,
with
a
little
sharp
clatter
,
quite
in
a
malicious
and
unnatural
manner
.
 
<EOS>
But
before
this
happened
we
had
had
a
slight
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
little
silver
jug
was
cream
,
in
the
larger
one
was
milk
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Mr
Mulliner
came
in
,
Carlo
began
to
beg
,
which
was
a
thing
our
manners
forebade
us
to
do
,
though
I
am
sure
we
were
just
as
hungry
;
and
Mrs
Jamieson
said
she
was
certain
we
would
excuse
her
if
she
gave
her
poor
dumb
Carlo
his
tea
first
.
<EOS>
She
accordingly
mixed
a
saucerful
for
him
,
and
put
it
down
for
him
to
lap
;
and
then
she
told
us
how
intelligent
and
sensible
the
dear
little
fellow
was
;
he
knew
cream
quite
well
,
and
constantly
refused
tea
with
only
milk
in
it
:
 
<EOS>
so
the
milk
was
left
for
us
;
but
we
silently
thought
we
were
quite
as
intelligent
and
sensible
as
Carlo
,
and
felt
as
if
insult
were
added
to
injury
when
we
were
called
upon
to
admire
the
gratitude
evinced
by
his
wagging
his
tail
for
the
cream
which
should
have
been
ours
.
  
<EOS>
After
tea
we
thawed
down
into
common
-
life
subjects
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
thankful
to
Lady
Glenmire
for
having
proposed
some
more
bread
and
butter
,
and
this
mutual
want
made
us
better
acquainted
with
her
than
we
should
ever
have
been
with
talking
about
the
Court
,
though
Miss
Pole
did
say
she
had
hoped
to
know
how
the
dear
Queen
was
from
some
one
who
had
seen
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
friendship
begun
over
bread
and
butter
extended
on
to
cards
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glenmire
played
Preference
to
admiration
,
and
was
a
complete
authority
as
to
Ombre
and
Quadrille
.
 
<EOS>
Even
Miss
Pole
quite
forgot
to
say
"
my
lady
,
"
and
"
your
ladyship
,
"
and
said
"
Basto
!
<EOS>
ma'am
"
;
"
you
have
Spadille
,
I
believe
,
"
just
as
quietly
as
if
we
had
never
held
the
great
Cranford
Parliament
on
the
subject
of
the
proper
mode
of
addressing
a
peeress
.
  
<EOS>
As
a
proof
of
how
thoroughly
we
had
forgotten
that
we
were
in
the
presence
of
one
who
might
have
sat
down
to
tea
with
a
coronet
,
instead
of
a
cap
,
on
her
head
,
Mrs
Forrester
related
a
curious
little
fact
to
Lady
Glenmire
 
<EOS>
an
anecdote
known
to
the
circle
of
her
intimate
friends
,
but
of
which
even
Mrs
Jamieson
was
not
aware
.
<EOS>
It
related
to
some
fine
old
lace
,
the
sole
relic
of
better
days
,
which
Lady
Glenmire
was
admiring
on
Mrs
Forrester
's
collar
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
that
lady
,
"
such
lace
can
not
be
got
now
for
either
love
or
money
;
made
by
the
nuns
abroad
,
they
tell
me
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
that
they
ca
n't
make
it
now
even
there
.
 
<EOS>
But
perhaps
they
can
,
now
they
've
passed
the
Catholic
Emancipation
Bill
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
the
meantime
,
I
treasure
up
my
lace
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
n't
even
trust
the
washing
of
it
to
my
maid
"
(
the
little
charity
school
-
girl
I
have
named
before
,
but
who
sounded
well
as
"
my
maid
"
)
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
always
wash
it
myself
.
 
<EOS>
And
once
it
had
a
narrow
escape
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
,
your
ladyship
knows
that
such
lace
must
never
be
starched
or
ironed
.
 
<EOS>
Some
people
wash
it
in
sugar
and
water
,
and
some
in
coffee
,
to
make
it
the
right
yellow
colour
;
but
I
myself
have
a
very
good
receipt
for
washing
it
in
milk
,
which
stiffens
it
enough
,
and
gives
it
a
very
good
creamy
colour
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
ma'am
,
I
had
tacked
it
together
(
and
<EOS>
the
beauty
of
this
fine
lace
is
that
,
when
it
is
wet
,
it
goes
into
a
very
little
space
)
,
and
put
it
to
soak
in
milk
,
when
,
unfortunately
,
I
left
the
room
;
on
my
return
,
I
found
pussy
on
the
table
,
looking
very
like
a
thief
,
but
gulping
very
uncomfortably
,
as
if
she
was
half
-
chocked
with
something
she
wanted
to
swallow
and
could
not
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
would
you
believe
it
?
 
<EOS>
At
first
I
pitied
her
,
and
said
"
Poor
pussy
!
<EOS>
poor
pussy
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
till
,
all
at
once
,
I
looked
and
saw
the
cup
of
milk
<EOS>
empty
 
<EOS>
cleaned
out
!
 
<EOS>
"
You
naughty
cat
!
<EOS>
"
said
I
,
and
I
believe
I
was
provoked
enough
to
give
her
a
slap
,
which
did
no
good
,
but
only
helped
the
lace
down
 
just
as
one
slaps
a
choking
child
on
the
back
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
cried
,
I
was
so
vexed
;
but
I
determined
I
would
not
give
the
lace
up
without
a
struggle
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
hoped
the
lace
might
disagree
with
her
,
at
any
rate
;
but
it
would
have
been
too
much
for
Job
,
if
he
had
seen
,
as
I
did
,
that
cat
come
in
,
quite
placid
and
purring
,
not
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
,
and
almost
expecting
to
be
stroked
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
pussy
!
"
<EOS>
said
I
,
"
if
you
have
any
conscience
you
ought
not
to
expect
that
!
"
<EOS>
And
then
a
thought
struck
me
;
and
I
rang
the
bell
for
my
maid
,
and
sent
her
to
Mr
Hoggins
,
with
my
compliments
,
and
would
he
be
kind
enough
to
lend
me
one
of
his
top
-
boots
for
an
hour
?
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
think
there
was
anything
odd
in
the
message
;
but
Jenny
said
the
young
men
in
the
surgery
laughed
as
if
they
would
be
ill
at
my
wanting
a
top
-
boot
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
came
,
Jenny
and
I
put
pussy
in
,
with
her
forefeet
straight
down
,
so
that
they
were
fastened
,
and
could
not
scratch
,
and
we
gave
her
a
teaspoonful
of
current
-
jelly
in
which
(
your
ladyship
must
excuse
me
)
<EOS>
I
had
mixed
some
tartar
emetic
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
how
anxious
I
was
for
the
next
half
-
hour
.
<EOS>
I
took
pussy
to
my
own
room
,
and
spread
a
clean
towel
on
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
kissed
her
when
she
returned
the
lace
to
sight
,
very
much
as
it
had
gone
down
.
 
<EOS>
Jenny
had
boiling
water
ready
,
and
we
soaked
it
and
soaked
it
,
and
spread
it
on
a
lavender
-
bush
in
the
sun
before
I
could
touch
it
again
,
even
to
put
it
in
milk
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
your
ladyship
would
never
guess
that
it
had
been
in
pussy
's
inside
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
found
out
,
in
the
course
of
the
evening
,
that
Lady
Glenmire
was
going
to
pay
Mrs
Jamieson
a
long
visit
,
as
she
had
given
up
her
apartments
in
Edinburgh
,
and
had
no
ties
to
take
her
back
there
in
a
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
whole
,
we
were
rather
glad
to
hear
this
,
for
she
had
made
a
pleasant
impression
upon
us
;
and
it
was
also
very
comfortable
to
find
,
from
things
which
dropped
out
in
the
course
of
conversation
,
that
,
in
addition
to
many
other
genteel
qualities
,
she
was
far
removed
from
the
"
vulgarity
of
wealth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
find
it
very
unpleasant
walking
?
"
asked
Mrs
Jamieson
,
as
our
respective
servants
were
announced
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
pretty
regular
question
from
Mrs
Jamieson
,
who
had
her
own
carriage
in
the
coach
-
house
,
and
always
went
out
in
a
sedan
-
chair
to
the
very
shortest
distances
.
 
<EOS>
The
answers
were
nearly
as
much
a
matter
of
course
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
no
!
<EOS>
it
is
so
pleasant
and
still
at
night
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
Such
a
refreshment
after
the
excitement
of
a
party
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
stars
are
so
beautiful
!
"
 
<EOS>
This
last
was
from
Miss
Matty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
fond
of
astronomy
?
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glenmire
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
very
,
"
replied
Miss
Matty
,
rather
confused
at
the
moment
to
remember
which
was
astronomy
and
which
was
astrology
 
<EOS>
but
the
answer
was
true
under
either
circumstance
,
for
she
read
,
and
was
slightly
alarmed
at
Francis
Moore
's
astrological
predictions
;
and
,
as
to
astronomy
,
in
a
private
and
confidential
conversation
,
she
had
told
me
she
never
could
believe
that
the
earth
was
moving
constantly
,
and
that
she
would
not
believe
it
if
she
could
,
it
made
her
feel
so
tired
and
dizzy
whenever
she
thought
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
In
our
pattens
we
picked
our
way
home
with
extra
care
that
night
,
so
refined
and
delicate
were
our
perceptions
after
drinking
tea
with
"
my
lady

SIGNOR
BRUNONI
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
the
events
of
which
I
gave
an
account
in
my
last
paper
,
I
was
summoned
home
by
my
father
's
illness
;
and
for
a
time
I
forgot
,
in
anxiety
about
him
,
to
wonder
how
my
dear
friends
at
Cranford
were
getting
on
,
or
how
Lady
Glenmire
could
reconcile
herself
to
the
dulness
of
the
long
visit
which
she
was
still
paying
to
her
sister
-
in
-
law
,
Mrs
Jamieson
.
 
<EOS>
When
my
father
grew
a
little
stronger
I
accompanied
him
to
the
seaside
,
so
that
altogether
I
seemed
banished
from
Cranford
,
and
was
deprived
of
the
opportunity
of
hearing
any
chance
intelligence
of
the
dear
little
town
for
the
greater
part
of
that
year
.
  
<EOS>
Late
in
November
 
when
we
had
returned
home
again
,
and
my
father
was
once
more
in
good
health
 
<EOS>
I
received
a
letter
from
Miss
Matty
;
and
a
very
mysterious
letter
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
She
began
many
sentences
without
ending
them
,
running
them
one
into
another
,
in
much
the
same
confused
sort
of
way
in
which
written
words
run
together
on
blotting
-
paper
.
 
<EOS>
All
I
could
make
out
was
that
,
if
my
father
was
better
(
which
she
hoped
he
was
)
,
and
would
take
warning
and
wear
a
great
-
coat
from
Michaelmas
to
Lady
-
day
,
if
turbans
were
in
fashion
,
could
I
tell
her
?
 
<EOS>
Such
a
piece
of
gaiety
was
going
to
happen
as
had
not
been
seen
or
known
of
since
Wombwell
's
lions
came
,
when
one
of
them
ate
a
little
child
's
arm
;
and
she
was
,
perhaps
,
too
old
to
care
about
dress
,
but
a
new
cap
she
must
have
;
and
,
having
heard
that
turbans
were
worn
,
and
some
of
the
county
families
likely
to
come
,
she
would
like
to
look
tidy
,
if
I
would
bring
her
a
cap
from
the
milliner
I
employed
;
<EOS>
and
oh
,
dear
!
<EOS>
how
careless
of
her
to
forget
that
she
wrote
to
beg
I
would
come
and
pay
her
a
visit
next
Tuesday
;
when
she
hoped
to
have
something
to
offer
me
in
the
way
of
amusement
,
which
she
would
not
now
more
particularly
describe
,
only
sea
-
green
was
her
favourite
colour
.
 
<EOS>
So
she
ended
her
letter
;
but
in
a
P.S.
she
added
<EOS>
,
she
thought
she
might
as
well
tell
me
what
was
the
peculiar
attraction
to
Cranford
just
now
;
Signor
Brunoni
was
going
to
exhibit
his
wonderful
magic
in
the
Cranford
Assembly
Rooms
on
Wednesday
and
Friday
evening
in
the
following
week
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
very
glad
to
accept
the
invitation
from
my
dear
Miss
Matty
,
independently
of
the
conjuror
,
and
most
particularly
anxious
to
prevent
her
from
disfiguring
her
small
,
gentle
,
mousey
face
with
a
great
Saracen
's
head
turban
;
and
accordingly
,
I
bought
her
a
pretty
,
neat
,
middle
-
aged
cap
,
which
,
however
,
was
rather
a
disappointment
to
her
when
,
on
my
arrival
,
she
followed
me
into
my
bedroom
,
ostensibly
to
poke
the
fire
,
but
in
reality
,
I
do
believe
,
to
see
if
the
sea
-
green
turban
was
not
inside
the
cap
-
box
with
which
I
had
travelled
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
that
I
twirled
the
cap
round
on
my
hand
to
exhibit
back
and
side
fronts
:
 
<EOS>
her
heart
had
been
set
upon
a
turban
,
and
all
she
could
do
was
to
say
,
with
resignation
in
her
look
and
voice
     
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
did
your
best
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
just
like
the
caps
all
the
ladies
in
Cranford
are
wearing
,
and
they
have
had
theirs
for
a
year
,
I
dare
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
liked
something
newer
<EOS>
,
I
confess
 
something
more
like
the
turbans
<EOS>
Miss
Betty
Barker
tells
me
Queen
Adelaide
wears
;
but
it
is
very
pretty
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
dare
say
lavender
will
wear
better
than
sea
-
green
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
after
all
,
what
is
dress
,
that
we
should
care
anything
about
it
?
 
<EOS>
You
'll
tell
me
if
you
want
anything
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Here
is
the
bell
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
turbans
have
not
got
down
to
Drumble
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
saying
,
the
dear
old
lady
gently
bemoaned
herself
out
of
the
room
,
leaving
me
to
dress
for
the
evening
,
when
,
as
she
informed
me
,
she
expected
Miss
Pole
and
Mrs
Forrester
,
and
she
hoped
I
should
not
feel
myself
too
much
tired
to
join
the
party
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
I
should
not
;
and
I
made
some
haste
to
unpack
and
arrange
my
dress
;
but
,
with
all
my
speed
,
I
heard
the
arrivals
and
the
buzz
of
conversation
in
the
next
room
before
I
was
ready
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
I
opened
the
door
,
I
caught
the
words
,
"
I
was
foolish
to
expect
anything
very
genteel
out
of
the
Drumble
shops
;
poor
girl
!
<EOS>
she
did
her
best
,
I
've
no
doubt
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
,
for
all
that
,
I
had
rather
that
she
blamed
Drumble
and
me
than
disfigured
herself
with
a
turban
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
was
always
the
person
,
in
the
trio
of
Cranford
ladies
now
assembled
,
to
have
had
adventures
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
in
the
habit
of
spending
the
morning
in
rambling
from
shop
to
shop
,
not
to
purchase
anything
(
except
an
occasional
reel
of
cotton
or
a
piece
of
tape
)
,
but
to
see
the
new
articles
and
report
upon
them
,
and
to
collect
all
the
stray
pieces
of
intelligence
in
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
a
way
,
too
,
of
demurely
popping
hither
and
thither
into
all
sorts
of
places
to
gratify
her
curiosity
on
any
point
 
a
way
which
,
if
she
had
not
looked
so
very
genteel
and
prim
,
might
have
been
considered
impertinent
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
by
the
expressive
way
in
which
she
cleared
her
throat
,
and
waited
for
all
minor
subjects
(
such
as
caps
and
turbans
)
to
be
cleared
off
the
course
,
we
knew
she
had
something
very
particular
to
relate
,
when
the
due
pause
came
 
<EOS>
and
I
defy
any
people
possessed
of
common
modesty
to
keep
up
a
conversation
long
,
where
one
among
them
sits
up
aloft
in
silence
,
looking
down
upon
all
the
things
they
chance
to
say
as
trivial
and
contemptible
compared
to
what
they
could
disclose
,
if
properly
entreated
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
began
     
"
As
I
was
stepping
out
of
Gordon
's
shop
to
-
day
,
I
chanced
to
go
into
the
"
George
"
(
my
Betty
has
a
second
-
cousin
who
is
chambermaid
there
,
and
I
thought
Betty
would
like
to
hear
how
she
was
)
,
and
,
not
seeing
anyone
about
,
I
strolled
up
the
staircase
,
and
found
myself
in
the
passage
leading
to
the
Assembly
Room
(
you
and
I
remember
the
Assembly
Room
,
I
am
sure
,
Miss
Matty
!
<EOS>
and
the
minuets
de
la
cour
!
)
<EOS>
;
so
I
went
on
,
not
thinking
of
what
I
was
about
,
when
,
all
at
once
,
I
perceived
that
I
was
in
the
middle
of
the
preparations
for
to
-
morrow
night
 
<EOS>
the
room
being
divided
with
great
clothes
-
maids
,
over
which
Crosby
's
men
were
tacking
red
flannel
;
very
dark
and
odd
<EOS>
it
seemed
;
it
quite
bewildered
me
,
and
I
was
going
on
behind
the
screens
,
in
my
absence
of
mind
,
when
a
gentleman
(
quite
the
gentleman
,
I
can
assure
you
)
stepped
forwards
and
asked
if
I
had
any
business
he
could
arrange
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
spoke
such
pretty
broken
English
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
help
thinking
of
Thaddeus
of
Warsaw
,
and
the
Hungarian
Brothers
,
and
Santo
Sebastiani
;
and
while
I
was
busy
picturing
his
past
life
to
myself
,
he
had
bowed
me
out
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
But
wait
a
minute
!
 
<EOS>
You
have
not
heard
half
my
story
yet
!
 
<EOS>
I
was
going
downstairs
,
when
who
should
I
meet
<EOS>
but
Betty
's
second
-
cousin
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
of
course
,
I
stopped
to
speak
to
her
for
Betty
's
sake
;
and
she
told
me
that
I
had
really
seen
the
conjuror
 
<EOS>
the
gentleman
who
spoke
broken
English
was
Signor
Brunoni
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Just
at
this
moment
he
passed
us
on
the
stairs
,
making
such
a
graceful
bow
!
<EOS>
in
reply
to
which
I
dropped
a
curtsey
 
<EOS>
all
foreigners
have
such
polite
manners
,
one
catches
something
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
had
gone
downstairs
,
I
bethought
me
that
I
had
dropped
my
glove
in
the
Assembly
Room
(
it
was
safe
in
my
muff
all
the
time
,
but
I
never
found
it
till
afterwards
)
;
so
I
went
back
,
and
,
just
as
I
was
creeping
up
the
passage
left
on
one
side
of
the
great
screen
that
goes
nearly
across
the
room
,
who
should
I
see
but
<EOS>
the
very
same
gentleman
that
had
met
me
before
,
and
passed
me
on
the
stairs
,
coming
now
forwards
from
the
inner
part
of
the
room
,
to
which
there
is
no
entrance
 
you
remember
,
Miss
Matty
 
and
just
repeating
,
in
his
pretty
broken
English
,
the
inquiry
if
I
had
any
business
there
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
that
he
put
it
quite
so
bluntly
,
but
he
seemed
very
determined
that
I
should
not
pass
the
screen
 
<EOS>
so
,
of
course
,
I
explained
about
my
glove
,
which
,
curiously
enough
,
I
found
at
that
very
moment
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
,
then
,
had
seen
the
conjuror
 
<EOS>
the
real
,
live
conjuror
!
<EOS>
and
numerous
were
the
questions
we
all
asked
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Had
he
a
beard
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Was
he
young
,
or
old
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Fair
,
or
dark
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Did
he
look
"
  
(
unable
to
shape
my
question
prudently
,
I
put
it
in
another
form
)
  
<EOS>
"
How
did
he
look
?
"
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
Miss
Pole
was
the
heroine
of
the
evening
,
owing
to
her
morning
's
encounter
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
was
not
the
rose
(
that
is
to
say
the
conjuror
)
<EOS>
she
had
been
near
it
.
  
<EOS>
Conjuration
,
sleight
of
hand
,
magic
,
witchcraft
,
were
the
subjects
of
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
was
slightly
sceptical
,
and
inclined
to
think
there
might
be
a
scientific
solution
found
for
even
the
proceedings
of
the
Witch
of
Endor
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
believed
everything
,
from
ghosts
to
death
-
watches
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
ranged
between
the
two
 
always
convinced
by
the
last
speaker
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
she
was
naturally
more
inclined
to
Mrs
Forrester
's
side
,
but
a
desire
of
proving
herself
a
worthy
sister
to
Miss
Jenkyns
kept
her
equally
balanced
 
Miss
Jenkyns
,
who
would
never
allow
a
servant
to
call
the
little
rolls
of
tallow
that
formed
themselves
round
candles
"
winding
-
sheets
,
"
but
insisted
on
their
being
spoken
of
as
"
roley-
poleys
!
"
 
<EOS>
A
sister
of
hers
to
be
superstitious
!
 
<EOS>
It
would
never
do
.
  
<EOS>
After
tea
,
I
was
despatched
downstairs
into
the
dining
-
parlour
for
that
volume
of
the
old
Encyclopaedia
which
contained
the
nouns
beginning
with
C
,
in
order
that
Miss
Pole
might
prime
herself
with
scientific
explanations
for
the
tricks
of
the
following
evening
.
<EOS>
It
spoilt
the
pool
at
Preference
which
Miss
Matty
and
Mrs
Forrester
had
been
looking
forward
to
,
for
Miss
Pole
<EOS>
became
so
much
absorbed
in
her
subject
,
and
the
plates
by
which
it
was
illustrated
,
that
we
felt
it
would
be
cruel
to
disturb
her
otherwise
than
by
one
or
two
well
-
timed
yawns
,
which
I
threw
in
now
<EOS>
and
then
,
for
I
was
really
touched
by
the
meek
way
in
which
the
two
ladies
were
bearing
their
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
But
Miss
Pole
only
read
the
more
zealously
,
imparting
to
us
no
more
information
than
this
     
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
see
;
I
comprehend
perfectly
.
 
<EOS>
A
represents
the
ball
.
 
<EOS>
Put
A
between
B
and
D
 
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
between
C
and
F
,
and
turn
the
second
joint
of
the
third
finger
of
your
left
hand
over
the
wrist
of
your
right
H.
Very
clear
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
My
dear
Mrs
Forrester
,
conjuring
and
witchcraft
is
a
mere
affair
of
the
alphabet
.
 
<EOS>
Do
let
me
read
you
this
one
passage
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
implored
Miss
Pole
to
spare
her
,
saying
,
from
a
child
upwards
<EOS>
,
she
never
could
understand
being
read
aloud
to
;
and
I
dropped
the
pack
of
cards
,
which
I
had
been
shuffling
very
audibly
,
and
by
this
discreet
movement
I
obliged
Miss
Pole
to
perceive
that
Preference
was
to
have
been
the
order
of
the
evening
,
and
to
propose
,
rather
unwillingly
,
that
the
pool
should
commence
.
 
<EOS>
The
pleasant
brightness
that
stole
over
the
other
two
ladies
'
faces

<EOS>
Miss
Matty
had
one
or
two
twinges
of
self
-
reproach
for
having
interrupted
Miss
Pole
in
her
studies
:
 
and
did
not
remember
her
cards
well
,
or
give
her
full
attention
to
the
game
,
until
she
had
soothed
her
conscience
by
offering
to
lend
the
volume
of
the
Encyclopaedia
to
Miss
Pole
,
who
accepted
it
thankfully
,
and
said
Betty
should
take
it
home
when
she
came
with
the
lantern
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
evening
we
were
all
in
a
little
gentle
flutter
at
the
idea
of
the
gaiety
before
us
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
went
up
to
dress
betimes
,
and
hurried
me
until
I
was
ready
,
when
we
found
we
had
an
hour
-
and
-
a-
half
to
wait
before
the
"
doors
opened
at
seven
precisely
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
we
had
only
twenty
yards
to
go
!
 
<EOS>
However
,
as
Miss
Matty
said
,
it
would
not
do
to
get
too
much
absorbed
in
anything
,
and
forget
the
time
;
so
she
thought
we
had
better
sit
quietly
,
without
lighting
the
candles
,
till
five
minutes
to
seven
.
 
<EOS>
So
Miss
Matty
dozed
,
and
I
knitted
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
we
set
off
;
and
at
the
door
under
the
carriage
-
way
at
the
"
George
,
"
we
met
Mrs
Forrester
and
Miss
Pole
:
 
<EOS>
the
latter
was
discussing
the
subject
of
the
evening
with
more
vehemence
than
ever
,
and
throwing
X
's
and
B
's
at
our
heads
like
hailstones
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
even
copied
one
or
two
of
the
"
receipts
"
 
<EOS>
a
s
<EOS>
she
called
them
 
for
the
different
tricks
,
on
backs
of
letters
,
ready
to
explain
and
to
detect
Signor
Brunoni
's
arts
.
  
<EOS>
We
went
into
the
cloak
-
room
adjoining
the
Assembly
Room
;
Miss
Matty
gave
a
sigh
or
two
to
her
departed
youth
,
and
the
remembrance
of
the
last
time
she
had
been
there
,
as
she
adjusted
her
pretty
new
cap
before
the
strange
,
quaint
old
mirror
in
the
cloak
-
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
Assembly
Room
had
been
added
to
the
inn
,
about
a
hundred
years
before
,
by
the
different
county
families
,
who
met
together
there
once
a
month
during
the
winter
to
dance
and
play
at
cards
.
 
<EOS>
Many
a
county
beauty
had
first
swung
through
the
minuet
that
she
afterwards
danced
before
Queen
Charlotte
in
this
very
room
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
said
that
one
of
the
Gunnings
had
graced
the
apartment
with
her
beauty
;
it
was
certain
that
a
rich
and
beautiful
widow
,
Lady
Williams
,
had
here
been
smitten
with
the
noble
figure
of
a
young
artist
,
who
was
staying
with
some
family
in
the
neighbourhood
for
professional
purposes
,
and
accompanied
his
patrons
to
the
Cranford
Assembly
.
 
<EOS>
And
a
pretty
bargain
poor
Lady
Williams
had
of
her
handsome
husband
,
if
all
tales
were
true
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
no
beauty
blushed
and
dimpled
along
the
sides
of
the
Cranford
Assembly
Room
;
no
handsome
artist
won
hearts
by
his
bow
,
chapeau
bras
in
hand
;
the
old
room
was
dingy
;
the
salmon
-
coloured
paint
had
faded
into
a
drab
;
great
pieces
of
plaster
had
chipped
off
from
the
fine
wreaths
and
festoons
on
its
walls
;
but
still
a
mouldy
odour
of
aristocracy
lingered
about
the
place
,
and
a
dusty
recollection
of
the
days
that
were
gone
made
Miss
Matty
and
Mrs
Forrester
bridle
up
as
they
entered
,
and
walk
mincingly
up
the
room
,
as
if
there
were
a
number
of
genteel
observers
,
instead
of
two
little
boys
with
a
stick
of
toffee
between
them
with
which
to
beguile
the
time
.
  
<EOS>
We
stopped
short
at
the
second
front
row
;
I
could
hardly
understand
why
,
until
I
heard
Miss
Pole
ask
a
stray
waiter
if
any
of
the
county
families
were
expected
;
and
when
he
shook
his
head
,
and
believed
not
,
Mrs
Forrester
and
Miss
Matty
moved
forwards
,
and
our
party
represented
a
conversational
square
.
 
<EOS>
The
front
row
was
soon
augmented
and
enriched
by
Lady
Glenmire
and
Mrs
Jamieson
.
 
<EOS>
We
six
occupied
the
two
front
rows
,
and
our
aristocratic
seclusion
was
respected
by
the
groups
of
shop
-
keepers
who
strayed
in
from
time
to
time
and
huddled
together
on
the
back
benches
.
 
<EOS>
At
least
I
conjectured
so
,
from
the
noise
they
made
,
and
the
sonorous
bumps
they
gave
in
sitting
down
;
but
when
,
in
weariness
of
the
obstinate
green
curtain
that
would
not
draw
up
,
but
would
stare
at
me
with
two
odd
eyes
,
seen
through
holes
,
as
in
the
old
tapestry
story
,
I
would
fain
have
looked
round
at
the
merry
<EOS>
chattering
people
behind
me
<EOS>
,
Miss
Pole
clutched
my
arm
,
and
begged
me
not
to
turn
,
for
"
it
was
not
the
thing
.
"
 
<EOS>
What
"
the
thing
"
was
,
I
never
could
find
out
,
but
it
must
have
been
something
eminently
dull
and
tiresome
.
<EOS>
However
,
we
all
sat
eyes
<EOS>
right
,
square
front
,
gazing
at
the
tantalising
curtain
,
and
hardly
speaking
intelligibly
,
we
were
so
afraid
of
being
caught
in
the
vulgarity
of
making
any
noise
in
a
place
of
public
amusement
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
was
the
most
fortunate
,
for
she
fell
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
the
eyes
disappeared
 
the
curtain
quivered
 
<EOS>
one
side
went
up
before
the
other
,
which
stuck
fast
;
it
was
dropped
again
,
and
,
with
a
fresh
effort
,
and
a
vigorous
pull
from
some
unseen
hand
,
it
flew
up
,
revealing
to
our
sight
a
magnificent
gentleman
in
the
Turkish
costume
,
seated
before
a
little
table
,
gazing
at
us
<EOS>
(
I
should
have
said
with
the
same
eyes
that
I
had
last
seen
through
the
hole
in
the
curtain
)
with
calm
and
condescending
dignity
,
"
like
a
being
of
another
sphere
,
"
as
I
heard
a
sentimental
voice
ejaculate
behind
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
not
Signor
Brunoni
!
"
said
Miss
Pole
decidedly
;
and
so
audibly
that
I
am
sure
he
heard
,
for
he
glanced
down
over
his
flowing
beard
at
our
party
with
an
air
of
mute
reproach
.
 
<EOS>
"
Signor
Brunoni
had
no
beard
 
<EOS>
but
perhaps
he
'll
come
soon
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
she
lulled
herself
into
patience
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Miss
Matty
had
reconnoitred
through
her
eye
-
glass
,
wiped
it
,
and
looked
again
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
turned
round
,
and
said
to
me
,
in
a
kind
,
mild
,
sorrowful
tone
     
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
dear
,
turbans
ARE
worn
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
we
had
no
time
for
more
conversation
.
 
<EOS>
The
Grand
Turk
,
as
Miss
Pole
chose
to
call
him
,
arose
and
announced
himself
as
Signor
Brunoni
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
him
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Miss
Pole
,
in
a
defiant
manner
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
again
,
with
the
same
dignified
upbraiding
in
his
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
!
"
<EOS>
she
repeated
more
positively
than
ever
.
"
<EOS>
Signor
Brunoni
had
not
got
that
muffy
sort
of
thing
about
his
chin
,
but
looked
like
a
close
-
shaved
Christian
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
's
energetic
speeches
had
the
good
effect
of
wakening
up
Mrs
Jamieson
,
who
opened
her
eyes
wide
,
in
sign
of
the
deepest
attention
 
a
proceeding
which
silenced
Miss
Pole
and
encouraged
the
Grand
Turk
to
proceed
,
which
he
did
in
very
broken
English
 
<EOS>
so
broken
that
there
was
no
cohesion
between
the
parts
of
his
sentences
;
a
fact
which
he
himself
perceived
at
last
,
and
so
left
off
speaking
and
proceeded
to
action
.
  
<EOS>
Now
we
WERE
astonished
.
 
<EOS>
How
he
did
his
tricks
I
could
not
imagine
;
no
,
not
even
when
Miss
Pole
pulled
out
her
pieces
of
paper
and
began
reading
aloud
 
or
at
least
in
a
very
audible
whisper
 
<EOS>
the
separate
"
receipts
"
for
the
most
common
of
his
tricks
.
 
<EOS>
If
ever
I
saw
a
man
frown
and
look
enraged
,
I
saw
the
Grand
Turk
frown
at
Miss
Pole
;
but
,
as
she
said
,
what
could
be
expected
but
unchristian
looks
from
a
Mussulman
?
 
<EOS>
If
Miss
Pole
were
sceptical
,
and
more
engrossed
with
her
receipts
and
diagrams
than
with
his
tricks
,
Miss
Matty
and
Mrs
Forrester
were
mystified
and
perplexed
to
the
highest
degree
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
kept
taking
her
spectacles
off
and
wiping
them
,
as
if
she
thought
it
was
something
defective
in
them
which
made
the
legerdemain
;
and
Lady
Glenmire
,
who
had
seen
many
curious
sights
in
Edinburgh
,
was
very
much
struck
with
the
tricks
,
and
would
not
at
all
agree
with
Miss
Pole
,
who
declared
that
anybody
could
do
them
with
a
little
practice
,
and
that
she
would
,
herself
,
undertake
to
do
all
he
did
,
with
two
hours
given
to
study
the
Encyclopaedia
and
make
her
third
finger
flexible
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
Miss
Matty
and
Mrs
Forrester
became
perfectly
awestricken
.
<EOS>
They
whispered
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
sat
just
behind
them
,
so
I
could
not
help
hearing
what
they
were
saying
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
asked
Mrs
Forrester
"
if
she
thought
it
was
quite
right
to
have
come
to
see
such
things
?
<EOS>
She
could
not
help
fearing
they
were
lending
encouragement
to
something
that
was
not
quite
"
  
<EOS>
A
little
shake
of
the
head
filled
up
the
blank
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
replied
,
that
the
same
thought
had
crossed
her
mind
;
she
too
was
feeling
very
uncomfortable
,
it
was
so
very
strange
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
quite
certain
that
it
was
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
which
was
in
that
loaf
just
now
;
and
it
had
been
in
her
own
hand
not
five
minutes
before
.
 
<EOS>
She
wondered
who
had
furnished
the
bread
?
 
<EOS>
She
was
sure
it
could
not
be
Dakin
,
because
he
was
the
churchwarden
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
Miss
Matty
half
-
turned
towards
me
     
<EOS>
"
Will
you
look
,
my
dear
 
you
are
a
stranger
in
the
town
,
and
it
wo
n't
give
rise
to
unpleasant
reports
 
<EOS>
will
you
just
look
round
and
see
if
the
rector
is
here
?
 
<EOS>
If
he
is
,
I
think
we
may
conclude
that
this
wonderful
man
is
sanctioned
by
the
Church
,
and
that
will
be
a
great
relief
to
my
mind
.
  
<EOS>
I
looked
,
and
I
saw
the
tall
,
thin
,
dry
,
dusty
rector
,
sitting
surrounded
by
National
School
boys
,
guarded
by
troops
of
his
own
sex
from
any
approach
of
the
many
Cranford
spinsters
.
 
<EOS>
His
kind
face
was
all
agape
with
broad
smiles
,
and
the
boys
around
him
were
in
chinks
of
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
Miss
Matty
that
the
Church
was
smiling
approval
,
which
set
her
mind
at
ease
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
never
named
Mr
Hayter
,
the
rector
,
because
I
,
as
a
well
-
to-
do
and
happy
young
woman
,
never
came
in
contact
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
an
old
bachelor
,
but
as
afraid
of
matrimonial
reports
getting
abroad
about
him
as
any
girl
of
eighteen
:
 
and
he
would
rush
into
a
shop
or
dive
down
an
entry
,
sooner
than
encounter
any
of
the
Cranford
ladies
in
the
street
;
and
,
as
for
the
Preference
parties
,
I
did
not
wonder
at
his
not
accepting
invitations
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
To
tell
the
truth
,
I
always
suspected
Miss
Pole
of
having
given
very
vigorous
chase
to
Mr
Hayter
when
he
first
came
to
Cranford
;
and
not
the
less
,
because
now
she
appeared
to
share
so
vividly
in
his
dread
lest
her
name
should
ever
be
coupled
with
his
.
 
<EOS>
He
found
all
his
interests
among
the
poor
and
helpless
;
he
had
treated
the
National
School
boys
this
very
night
to
the
performance
;
and
virtue
was
for
once
its
own
reward
,
for
they
guarded
him
right
and
left
,
and
clung
round
him
as
if
he
had
been
the
queen
-
bee
<EOS>
and
they
the
swarm
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
so
safe
in
their
environment
that
he
could
even
afford
to
give
our
party
a
bow
as
we
filed
out
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
ignored
his
presence
,
and
pretended
to
be
absorbed
in
convincing
us
that
we
had
been
cheated
,
and
had
not
seen
Signor
Brunoni
after
all
.
   
<EOS>
THE
PANIC
 
<EOS>
I
think
a
series
of
circumstances
dated
from
Signor
Brunoni
's
visit
to
Cranford
,
which
seemed
at
the
time
connected
in
our
minds
with
him
,
though
I
do
n't
know
that
he
had
anything
really
to
do
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
All
at
once
all
sorts
of
uncomfortable
rumours
got
afloat
in
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
one
or
two
robberies
 
real
bona
fide
robberies
;
men
had
up
before
the
magistrates
and
committed
for
trial
 
and
that
seemed
to
make
us
all
afraid
of
being
robbed
;
and
for
a
long
time
,
at
Miss
Matty
's
,
I
know
,
we
used
to
make
a
regular
expedition
<EOS>
all
round
the
kitchens
and
cellars
every
night
,
Miss
Matty
leading
the
way
,
armed
with
the
poker
,
<EOS>
I
following
with
the
hearth
-
brush
,
and
Martha
carrying
the
shovel
and
fire
-
irons
with
which
to
sound
the
alarm
;
and
by
the
accidental
hitting
together
of
them
she
often
frightened
us
so
much
that
we
bolted
ourselves
up
,
all
three
together
,
in
the
back
-
kitchen
,
or
store
-
room
,
or
wherever
we
happened
to
be
,
till
,
when
our
affright
was
over
,
we
recollected
ourselves
and
set
out
afresh
with
double
valiance
.
 
<EOS>
By
day
we
heard
strange
stories
from
the
shopkeepers
and
cottagers
,
of
carts
that
went
about
in
the
dead
of
night
,
drawn
by
horses
shod
with
felt
,
and
guarded
by
men
in
dark
clothes
,
going
round
the
town
,
no
doubt
in
search
of
some
unwatched
house
or
some
unfastened
door
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
,
who
affected
great
bravery
herself
,
was
the
principal
person
to
collect
and
arrange
these
reports
so
as
to
make
them
assume
their
most
fearful
aspect
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
discovered
that
she
had
begged
one
of
Mr
Hoggins
's
worn
-
out
hats
to
hang
up
in
her
lobby
,
and
we
(
at
least
I
)
had
doubts
as
to
whether
she
really
would
enjoy
the
little
adventure
of
having
her
house
broken
into
,
as
she
protested
she
should
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
made
no
secret
of
being
an
arrant
coward
,
but
she
went
regularly
through
her
housekeeper
's
duty
of
inspection
 
only
the
hour
for
this
became
earlier
and
earlier
,
till
at
last
we
went
the
rounds
at
half
-
past
six
,
and
Miss
Matty
adjourned
to
bed
soon
after
seven
,
"
in
order
to
get
the
night
over
the
sooner

Cranford
had
so
long
piqued
itself
on
being
an
honest
and
moral
town
that
it
had
grown
to
fancy
itself
too
genteel
and
well
-
bred
to
be
otherwise
,
and
felt
the
stain
upon
its
character
at
this
time
doubly
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
comforted
ourselves
with
the
assurance
which
we
gave
to
each
other
that
the
robberies
could
never
have
been
committed
by
any
Cranford
person
;
it
must
have
been
a
stranger
or
strangers
who
brought
this
disgrace
upon
the
town
,
and
occasioned
as
many
precautions
as
if
we
were
living
among
the
Red
Indians
or
the
French
.
  
<EOS>
This
last
comparison
of
our
nightly
state
of
defence
and
fortification
was
made
by
Mrs
Forrester
,
whose
father
had
served
under
General
Burgoyne
in
the
American
war
,
and
whose
husband
had
fought
the
French
in
Spain
.
 
<EOS>
She
indeed
inclined
to
the
idea
that
,
in
some
way
,
the
French
were
connected
with
the
small
thefts
,
which
were
ascertained
facts
,
and
the
burglaries
and
highway
robberies
,
which
were
rumours
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
deeply
impressed
with
the
idea
of
French
spies
at
some
time
in
her
life
;
and
the
notion
could
never
be
fairly
eradicated
,
but
sprang
up
again
from
time
to
time
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
her
theory
was
this
:
  
<EOS>
The
Cranford
people
respected
themselves
too
much
,
and
were
too
grateful
to
the
aristocracy
who
were
so
kind
as
to
live
near
the
town
,
ever
to
disgrace
their
bringing
up
by
being
dishonest
or
immoral
;
therefore
,
we
must
believe
that
the
robbers
were
strangers
 
if
strangers
,
why
not
foreigners
?
 
<EOS>
if
foreigners
,
who
so
likely
as
the
French
?
 
<EOS>
Signor
Brunoni
spoke
broken
English
like
a
Frenchman
;
and
,
though
he
wore
a
turban
like
a
Turk
,
Mrs
Forrester
had
seen
a
print
of
Madame
de
Stael
with
a
turban
on
,
and
another
of
Mr
Denon
in
just
such
a
dress
as
that
in
which
the
conjuror
had
made
his
appearance
,
showing
clearly
that
the
French
,
as
well
as
the
Turks
,
wore
turbans
.
 
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
doubt
<EOS>
Signor
Brunoni
was
a
Frenchman
 
<EOS>
a
French
spy
come
to
discover
the
weak
and
undefended
places
of
England
,
and
doubtless
he
had
his
accomplices
.
 
<EOS>
For
her
part
,
she
,
Mrs
Forrester
,
had
always
had
her
own
opinion
of
Miss
Pole
's
adventure
at
the
"
George
Inn
"
 
s
eeing
two
men
where
only
one
was
believed
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
French
people
had
ways
and
means
<EOS>
which
,
she
was
thankful
to
say
,
the
English
knew
nothing
about
;
and
she
had
never
felt
quite
easy
in
her
mind
about
going
to
see
that
conjuror
 
<EOS>
it
was
rather
too
much
like
a
forbidden
thing
,
though
the
rector
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
Mrs
Forrester
grew
more
excited
than
we
had
ever
known
her
before
,
and
,
being
an
officer
's
daughter
and
widow
,
we
looked
up
to
her
opinion
,
of
course
.
  
<EOS>
Really
I
do
not
know
how
much
was
true
or
false
in
the
reports
which
flew
about
like
wildfire
just
at
this
time
;
but
it
seemed
to
me
then
that
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
that
at
Mardon
(
a
small
town
about
eight
miles
from
Cranford
)
<EOS>
houses
and
shops
were
entered
by
holes
made
in
the
walls
,
the
bricks
being
silently
carried
away
in
the
dead
of
the
night
,
and
all
done
so
quietly
that
no
sound
was
heard
either
in
or
out
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
gave
it
up
in
despair
when
she
heard
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
was
the
use
,
"
said
she
,
"
of
locks
and
bolts
,
and
bells
to
the
windows
,
and
going
round
the
house
every
night
?
 
<EOS>
That
last
trick
was
fit
for
a
conjuror
.
<EOS>
Now
she
did
believe
that
Signor
Brunoni
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
One
afternoon
,
about
five
o'clock
,
we
were
startled
by
a
hasty
knock
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
bade
me
run
and
tell
Martha
on
no
account
to
open
the
door
till
she
(
Miss
Matty
)
had
reconnoitred
through
the
window
;
and
she
armed
herself
with
a
footstool
to
drop
down
on
the
head
of
the
visitor
,
in
case
he
should
show
a
face
covered
with
black
crape
,
as
he
looked
up
in
answer
to
her
inquiry
of
who
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
nobody
but
Miss
Pole
and
Betty
.
 
<EOS>
The
former
came
upstairs
,
carrying
a
little
hand
-
basket
,
and
she
was
evidently
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
care
of
that
!
"
said
she
to
me
,
as
I
offered
to
relieve
her
of
her
basket
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
plate
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
there
is
a
plan
to
rob
my
house
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
come
to
throw
myself
on
your
hospitality
,
Miss
Matty
.
 
<EOS>
Betty
is
going
to
sleep
with
her
cousin
at
the
"
George
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
can
sit
up
here
all
night
if
you
will
allow
me
;
but
my
house
is
so
far
from
any
neighbours
,
and
I
do
n't
believe
we
could
be
heard
if
we
screamed
ever
so
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
said
Miss
Matty
,
"
what
has
alarmed
you
so
much
?
 
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
any
men
lurking
about
the
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
!
"
answered
Miss
Pole
.
 
<EOS>
"
Two
very
bad
-
looking
men
have
gone
three
times
past
the
house
,
very
slowly
;
and
an
Irish
beggar
-
woman
came
not
half
-
an
-
hour
ago
,
and
all
but
forced
herself
in
past
Betty
,
saying
her
children
were
starving
,
and
she
must
speak
to
the
mistress
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
,
she
said
"
mistress
,
"
though
there
was
a
hat
hanging
up
in
the
hall
,
and
it
would
have
been
more
natural
to
have
said
"
master
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
Betty
shut
the
door
in
her
face
,
and
came
up
to
me
,
and
we
got
the
spoons
together
,
and
sat
in
the
parlour
-
window
watching
till
we
saw
Thomas
Jones
going
from
his
work
,
when
we
called
to
him
and
asked
him
to
take
care
of
us
into
the
town
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
might
have
triumphed
over
Miss
Pole
,
who
had
professed
such
bravery
until
she
was
frightened
;
but
we
were
too
glad
to
perceive
that
she
shared
in
the
weaknesses
of
humanity
to
exult
over
her
;
and
I
gave
up
my
room
to
her
very
willingly
,
and
shared
Miss
Matty
's
bed
for
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
But
before
we
retired
,
the
two
ladies
rummaged
up
,
out
of
the
recesses
of
their
memory
,
such
horrid
stories
of
robbery
and
murder
that
I
quite
quaked
in
my
shoes
.
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
was
evidently
anxious
to
prove
that
such
terrible
events
had
occurred
within
her
experience
that
she
was
justified
in
her
sudden
panic
;
and
Miss
Matty
did
not
like
to
be
outdone
,
and
capped
every
story
with
one
yet
more
horrible
,
till
it
reminded
me
oddly
enough
,
of
an
old
story
I
had
read
somewhere
,
of
a
nightingale
and
a
musician
,
who
strove
one
against
the
other
which
could
produce
the
most
admirable
music
,
till
poor
Philomel
dropped
down
dead
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
the
stories
that
haunted
me
for
a
long
time
afterwards
was
of
a
girl
who
was
left
in
charge
of
a
great
house
in
Cumberland
on
some
particular
fair
-
day
,
when
the
other
servants
all
went
off
to
the
gaieties
.
 
<EOS>
The
family
were
away
in
London
,
and
a
pedlar
came
by
,
and
asked
to
leave
his
large
and
heavy
pack
in
the
kitchen
,
saying
he
would
call
for
it
again
at
night
;
and
the
girl
(
a
gamekeeper
's
daughter
)
,
roaming
about
in
search
of
amusement
,
chanced
to
hit
upon
a
gun
hanging
up
in
the
hall
,
and
took
it
down
to
look
at
the
chasing
;
and
it
went
off
through
the
open
kitchen
door
,
hit
the
pack
,
and
a
slow
dark
thread
of
blood
came
oozing
out
.
<EOS>
(
How
Miss
Pole
enjoyed
this
part
of
the
story
,
dwelling
on
each
word
as
if
she
loved
it
!
)
 
<EOS>
She
rather
hurried
over
the
further
account
of
the
girl
's
bravery
,
and
I
have
but
<EOS>
a
confused
idea
that
,
somehow
,
she
baffled
the
robbers
with
Italian
irons
,
heated
red
-
hot
,
and
then
restored
to
blackness
by
being
dipped
in
grease
.
  
<EOS>
We
parted
for
the
night
with
an
awe
-
stricken
wonder
as
to
what
we
should
hear
of
in
the
morning
 
and
,
on
my
part
,
with
a
vehement
desire
for
the
night
to
be
over
and
gone
:
 
I
was
so
afraid
lest
the
robbers
should
have
seen
,
from
some
dark
lurking
-
place
,
that
Miss
Pole
had
carried
off
her
plate
,
and
thus
have
a
double
motive
for
attacking
our
house
.
  
<EOS>
But
until
Lady
Glenmire
came
to
call
next
day
we
heard
of
nothing
unusual
.
 
<EOS>
The
kitchen
fire
-
irons
were
in
exactly
the
same
position
against
the
back
door
as
when
Martha
and
I
had
skilfully
piled
them
up
,
like
spillikins
,
ready
to
fall
with
an
awful
clatter
if
only
a
cat
had
touched
the
outside
panels
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
wondered
what
we
should
all
do
if
thus
awakened
and
alarmed
,
and
had
proposed
to
Miss
Matty
that
we
should
cover
up
our
faces
under
the
bedclothes
so
that
there
should
be
no
danger
of
the
robbers
thinking
that
we
could
identify
them
;
but
Miss
Matty
,
who
was
trembling
very
much
,
scouted
this
idea
,
and
said
we
owed
it
to
society
to
apprehend
them
,
and
that
she
should
certainly
do
her
best
to
lay
hold
of
them
and
lock
them
up
in
the
garret
till
morning
.
  
<EOS>
When
Lady
Glenmire
came
,
we
almost
felt
jealous
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
's
house
had
really
been
attacked
;
at
least
there
were
men
's
footsteps
to
be
seen
on
the
flower
borders
,
underneath
the
kitchen
windows
,
"
where
nae
men
should
be
;
"
and
Carlo
had
barked
all
through
the
night
as
if
strangers
were
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
had
been
awakened
by
Lady
Glenmire
,
and
they
had
rung
the
bell
which
communicated
with
Mr
Mulliner
's
room
in
the
third
storey
,
and
when
his
night
-
capped
head
had
appeared
over
the
bannisters
,
in
answer
to
the
summons
,
they
had
told
him
of
their
alarm
,
and
the
reasons
for
it
;
whereupon
he
retreated
into
his
bedroom
,
and
locked
the
door
(
for
fear
of
draughts
,
as
he
informed
them
in
the
morning
)
,
and
opened
the
window
,
and
called
out
valiantly
to
say
,
if
the
supposed
robbers
would
come
to
him
he
would
fight
them
;
but
,
as
Lady
Glenmire
observed
,
that
was
but
poor
comfort
,
since
they
would
have
to
pass
by
Mrs
Jamieson
's
room
and
her
own
before
they
could
reach
him
,
and
must
be
of
a
very
pugnacious
disposition
indeed
if
they
neglected
the
opportunities
of
robbery
presented
by
the
unguarded
lower
storeys
,
to
go
up
to
a
garret
,
and
there
force
a
door
in
order
to
get
at
the
champion
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Glenmire
,
after
waiting
and
listening
for
some
time
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
had
proposed
to
Mrs
Jamieson
that
they
should
go
to
bed
;
but
that
lady
said
she
should
not
feel
comfortable
unless
she
sat
up
and
watched
;
and
,
accordingly
,
she
packed
herself
warmly
up
on
the
sofa
,
where
she
was
found
by
the
housemaid
,
when
she
came
into
the
room
at
six
o'clock
,
fast
asleep
;
but
Lady
Glenmire
went
to
bed
,
and
kept
awake
all
night
.
  
<EOS>
When
Miss
Pole
heard
of
this
,
she
nodded
her
head
in
great
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
sure
we
should
hear
of
something
happening
in
Cranford
that
night
;
and
we
had
heard
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
clear
enough
they
had
first
proposed
to
attack
her
house
;
but
when
they
saw
that
she
and
Betty
were
on
their
guard
,
and
had
carried
off
the
plate
,
they
had
changed
their
tactics
and
gone
to
Mrs
Jamieson
's
,
and
no
one
knew
what
might
have
happened
if
Carlo
had
not
barked
,
like
a
good
dog
as
he
was
!
  
<EOS>
Poor
Carlo
!
<EOS>
his
barking
days
were
nearly
over
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
the
gang
who
infested
the
neighbourhood
were
afraid
of
him
,
or
whether
they
were
revengeful
enough
,
for
the
way
in
which
he
had
baffled
them
on
the
night
in
question
,
to
poison
him
;
or
whether
,
as
some
among
the
more
uneducated
people
thought
,
he
died
of
apoplexy
,
brought
on
by
too
much
feeding
and
too
little
exercise
;
at
any
rate
,
it
is
certain
that
,
two
days
after
this
eventful
night
,
Carlo
was
found
dead
,
with
his
poor
legs
stretched
out
stiff
in
the
attitude
of
running
,
as
if
by
such
unusual
exertion
he
could
escape
the
sure
pursuer
,
Death
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
all
sorry
for
Carlo
,
the
old
familiar
friend
who
had
snapped
at
us
for
so
many
years
;
and
the
mysterious
mode
of
his
death
made
us
very
uncomfortable
.
 
<EOS>
Could
Signor
Brunoni
be
at
the
bottom
of
this
?
 
<EOS>
He
had
apparently
killed
a
canary
with
only
a
word
of
command
;
his
will
seemed
of
deadly
force
;
who
knew
but
what
he
might
yet
be
lingering
in
the
neighbourhood
willing
all
sorts
of
awful
things
!
  
<EOS>
We
whispered
these
fancies
among
ourselves
in
the
evenings
;
but
in
the
mornings
our
courage
came
back
with
the
daylight
,
and
in
a
week
's
time
we
had
got
over
the
shock
of
Carlo
's
death
;
all
but
Mrs
Jamieson
.
 
<EOS>
She
,
poor
thing
,
felt
it
as
she
had
felt
no
event
since
her
husband
's
death
;
indeed
,
Miss
Pole
said
,
that
as
the
Honourable
Mr
Jamieson
drank
a
good
deal
,
and
occasioned
her
much
uneasiness
,
it
was
possible
that
Carlo
's
death
might
be
the
greater
affliction
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
always
a
tinge
of
cynicism
in
Miss
Pole
's
remarks
.
<EOS>
However
,
one
thing
was
clear
and
certain
 
<EOS>
it
was
necessary
for
Mrs
Jamieson
to
have
some
change
of
scene
;
and
Mr
Mulliner
was
very
impressive
on
this
point
,
shaking
his
head
whenever
we
inquired
after
his
mistress
,
and
speaking
of
her
loss
of
appetite
and
bad
nights
very
ominously
;
and
with
justice
too
,
for
if
she
had
two
characteristics
in
her
natural
state
of
health
<EOS>
they
were
a
facility
of
eating
and
sleeping
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
could
neither
eat
nor
sleep
,
she
must
be
indeed
out
of
spirits
and
out
of
health
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glenmire
(
who
had
evidently
taken
very
kindly
to
Cranford
)
did
not
like
the
idea
of
Mrs
Jamieson
's
going
to
Cheltenham
,
and
more
than
once
insinuated
pretty
plainly
that
it
was
Mr
Mulliner
's
doing
,
who
had
been
much
alarmed
on
the
occasion
of
the
house
being
attacked
,
and
since
had
said
,
more
than
once
,
that
he
felt
it
a
very
responsible
charge
to
have
to
defend
so
many
women
.
 
<EOS>
Be
that
as
it
might
,
Mrs
Jamieson
went
to
Cheltenham
,
escorted
by
Mr
Mulliner
;
and
Lady
Glenmire
remained
in
possession
of
the
house
,
her
ostensible
office
being
to
take
care
that
the
maid
-
servants
did
not
pick
up
followers
.
 
<EOS>
She
made
a
very
pleasant
-
looking
dragon
;
and
,
as
soon
as
it
was
arranged
for
her
stay
in
Cranford
,
she
found
out
that
Mrs
Jamieson
's
visit
to
Cheltenham
was
just
the
best
thing
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
let
her
house
in
Edinburgh
,
and
was
for
the
time
house
-
less
,
so
the
charge
of
her
sister
-
in
-
law
's
comfortable
abode
was
very
convenient
and
acceptable
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
was
very
much
inclined
to
instal
herself
as
a
heroine
,
because
of
the
decided
steps
she
had
taken
in
flying
from
the
two
men
and
one
woman
,
whom
she
entitled
"
that
murderous
gang
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
described
their
appearance
in
glowing
colours
,
and
I
noticed
that
every
time
she
went
over
the
story
some
fresh
trait
of
villainy
was
added
to
their
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
One
was
tall
 
<EOS>
he
grew
to
be
gigantic
in
height
before
we
had
done
with
him
;
he
of
course
had
black
hair
 
and
by
-
and
-
<EOS>
by
it
hung
in
elf
-
locks
over
his
forehead
and
down
his
back
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
was
short
and
broad
 
and
a
hump
sprouted
out
on
his
shoulder
before
we
heard
the
last
of
him
;
he
had
red
hair
 
which
deepened
into
carroty
;
and
she
was
almost
sure
he
had
a
cast
in
the
eye
 
a
decided
squint
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
the
woman
,
her
eyes
glared
,
and
she
was
masculine
-
looking
 
a
perfect
virago
;
most
probably
a
man
dressed
in
woman
's
clothes
;
afterwards
,
we
heard
of
a
beard
on
her
chin
,
and
a
manly
voice
and
a
stride
.
  
<EOS>
If
Miss
Pole
was
delighted
to
recount
the
events
of
that
afternoon
to
all
inquirers
,
others
were
not
so
proud
of
their
adventures
in
the
robbery
line
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Hoggins
,
the
surgeon
,
had
been
attacked
at
his
own
door
by
two
ruffians
,
who
were
concealed
in
the
shadow
of
the
porch
,
and
so
effectually
silenced
him
that
he
was
robbed
in
the
interval
between
ringing
his
bell
and
the
servant
's
answering
it
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
was
sure
it
would
turn
out
that
this
robbery
had
been
commited
by
"
her
men
,
"
and
went
the
very
day
she
heard
the
report
to
have
her
teeth
examined
,
and
to
question
Mr
Hoggins
.
 
<EOS>
She
came
to
us
afterwards
;
so
we
heard
what
she
had
heard
,
straight
and
direct
from
the
source
,
while
we
were
yet
in
the
excitement
and
flutter
of
the
agitation
caused
by
the
first
intelligence
;
for
the
event
had
only
occurred
the
night
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Miss
Pole
,
sitting
down
with
the
decision
of
a
person
who
has
made
up
her
mind
as
to
the
nature
of
life
and
the
world
(
and
such
people
never
tread
lightly
,
or
seat
themselves
without
a
bump
)
,
"
<EOS>
well
,
Miss
Matty
!
<EOS>
men
will
be
men
.
 
<EOS>
Every
mother
's
son
of
them
wishes
to
be
considered
Samson
and
Solomon
rolled
into
one
 
too
strong
ever
to
be
beaten
or
discomfited
 
<EOS>
too
wise
ever
to
be
outwitted
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
will
notice
,
they
have
always
foreseen
events
,
though
they
never
tell
one
for
one
's
warning
before
the
events
happen
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
was
a
man
,
and
I
know
the
sex
pretty
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
talked
herself
out
of
breath
,
and
we
should
have
been
very
glad
to
fill
up
the
necessary
pause
as
chorus
,
but
we
did
not
exactly
know
what
to
say
,
or
which
man
had
suggested
this
diatribe
against
the
sex
;
so
we
only
joined
in
generally
,
with
a
grave
shake
of
the
head
,
and
a
soft
murmur
of
"
They
are
very
incomprehensible
,
certainly
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
only
think
,
"
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
,
I
have
undergone
the
risk
of
having
one
of
my
remaining
teeth
drawn
(
for
one
is
terribly
at
the
mercy
of
any
surgeon
-
dentist
;
and
I
,
for
one
,
always
speak
them
fair
till
I
have
got
my
mouth
out
of
their
clutches
)
,
and
,
after
all
,
Mr
Hoggins
is
too
much
of
a
man
to
own
that
he
was
robbed
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
robbed
!
"
exclaimed
the
chorus
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
tell
me
!
"
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
exclaimed
,
angry
that
we
could
be
for
a
moment
imposed
upon
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
believe
he
was
robbed
,
just
as
Betty
told
me
,
and
he
is
ashamed
to
own
it
;
and
,
to
be
sure
,
it
was
very
silly
of
him
to
be
robbed
just
at
his
own
door
;
I
daresay
he
feels
that
such
a
thing
wo
n't
raise
him
in
the
eyes
of
Cranford
society
,
and
is
anxious
to
conceal
it
 
<EOS>
but
he
need
not
have
tried
to
impose
upon
me
,
by
saying
I
must
have
heard
an
exaggerated
account
of
some
petty
theft
of
a
neck
of
mutton
,
which
,
it
seems
,
was
stolen
out
of
the
safe
in
his
yard
last
week
;
he
had
the
impertinence
to
add
,
he
believed
that
that
was
taken
by
the
cat
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
,
if
I
could
get
at
the
bottom
of
it
,
it
was
that
Irishman
dressed
up
in
woman
's
clothes
,
who
came
spying
about
my
house
,
with
the
story
about
the
starving
children
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
we
had
duly
condemned
the
want
of
candour
which
Mr
Hoggins
had
evinced
,
and
abused
men
in
general
,
taking
him
for
the
representative
and
type
,
we
got
round
to
the
subject
about
which
we
had
been
talking
when
Miss
Pole
came
in
;
namely
,
how
far
,
in
the
present
disturbed
state
of
the
country
,
we
could
venture
to
accept
an
invitation
which
Miss
Matty
had
just
received
from
Mrs
Forrester
,
to
come
as
usual
and
keep
the
anniversary
of
her
wedding
-
day
by
drinking
tea
with
her
at
five
o'clock
,
and
playing
a
quiet
pool
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
had
said
that
she
asked
us
with
some
diffidence
,
because
the
roads
were
,
she
feared
,
very
unsafe
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
suggested
that
perhaps
one
of
us
would
not
object
to
take
the
sedan
,
and
that
the
others
,
by
walking
briskly
,
might
keep
up
with
the
long
trot
of
the
chairmen
,
and
so
we
might
all
arrive
safely
at
Over
Place
,
a
suburb
of
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
(
No
;
that
is
too
large
an
expression
:
 
a
small
cluster
of
houses
separated
from
Cranford
by
about
two
hundred
yards
of
a
dark
and
lonely
lane
.
)
<EOS>
There
was
no
doubt
but
that
a
similar
note
was
awaiting
Miss
Pole
at
home
;
so
her
call
was
a
very
fortunate
affair
,
as
it
enabled
us
to
consult
together
.
 
<EOS>
We
would
all
much
rather
have
declined
this
invitation
;
but
we
felt
that
it
would
not
be
quite
kind
to
Mrs
Forrester
,
who
would
otherwise
be
left
to
a
solitary
retrospect
of
her
not
very
happy
or
fortunate
life
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
and
Miss
Pole
had
been
visitors
on
this
occasion
for
many
years
,
and
now
they
gallantly
determined
to
nail
their
colours
to
the
mast
,
and
to
go
through
Darkness
Lane
rather
than
fail
in
loyalty
to
their
friend
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
the
evening
came
,
Miss
Matty
(
for
it
was
she
who
was
voted
into
the
chair
,
as
she
had
a
cold
)
,
before
being
shut
down
in
the
sedan
,
like
jack
-
in
-
a
-
box
,
implored
the
chairmen
,
whatever
might
befall
,
not
to
run
away
and
leave
her
fastened
up
there
,
to
be
murdered
;
and
even
after
they
had
promised
,
I
saw
her
tighten
her
features
into
the
stern
determination
of
a
martyr
,
and
she
gave
me
a
melancholy
and
ominous
shake
of
the
head
through
the
glass
.
<EOS>
However
,
we
got
there
safely
,
only
rather
out
of
breath
,
for
it
was
who
could
trot
hardest
through
Darkness
Lane
,
and
I
am
afraid
<EOS>
poor
Miss
Matty
was
sadly
jolted
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
had
made
extra
preparations
,
in
acknowledgment
of
our
exertion
in
coming
to
see
her
through
such
dangers
.
 
<EOS>
The
usual
forms
of
genteel
ignorance
as
to
what
her
servants
might
send
up
were
all
gone
through
;
and
harmony
and
Preference
seemed
likely
to
be
the
order
of
the
evening
,
but
for
an
interesting
conversation
that
began
I
do
n't
know
how
,
but
which
had
relation
,
of
course
,
to
the
robbers
who
infested
the
neighbourhood
of
Cranford
.
  
<EOS>
Having
braved
the
dangers
of
Darkness
Lane
,
and
thus
having
a
little
stock
of
reputation
for
courage
to
fall
back
upon
;
and
also
,
I
daresay
,
desirous
of
proving
ourselves
superior
to
men
(
videlicet
Mr
Hoggins
)
in
the
article
of
candour
,
we
began
to
relate
our
individual
fears
,
and
the
private
precautions
we
each
of
us
took
.
<EOS>
I
owned
that
my
pet
apprehension
was
eyes
 
<EOS>
eyes
looking
at
me
,
and
watching
me
,
glittering
out
from
some
dull
,
flat
,
wooden
surface
;
and
that
if
I
dared
to
go
up
to
my
looking
-
glass
when
I
was
panic
-
stricken
,
I
should
certainly
turn
it
round
,
with
its
back
towards
me
,
for
fear
of
seeing
eyes
behind
me
looking
out
of
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
I
saw
Miss
Matty
nerving
herself
up
for
a
confession
;
and
at
last
out
it
came
.
 
<EOS>
She
owned
that
,
ever
since
she
had
been
a
girl
,
she
had
dreaded
being
caught
by
her
last
leg
,
just
as
she
was
getting
into
bed
,
by
some
one
concealed
under
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
,
when
she
was
younger
and
more
active
,
she
used
to
take
a
flying
leap
from
a
distance
,
and
so
bring
both
her
legs
up
safely
into
bed
at
once
;
but
that
this
had
always
annoyed
Deborah
,
who
piqued
herself
upon
getting
into
bed
gracefully
,
and
she
had
given
it
up
in
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
the
old
terror
would
often
come
over
her
,
especially
since
Miss
Pole
's
house
had
been
attacked
(
we
had
got
quite
to
believe
in
the
fact
of
the
attack
having
taken
place
)
,
and
yet
it
was
very
unpleasant
to
think
of
looking
under
a
bed
,
and
seeing
a
man
concealed
,
with
a
great
,
fierce
face
staring
out
at
you
;
so
<EOS>
she
had
bethought
herself
of
something
 
<EOS>
perhaps
I
had
noticed
that
she
had
told
Martha
to
buy
her
a
penny
ball
,
such
as
children
play
with
 
and
now
she
rolled
this
ball
under
the
bed
every
night
:
 
if
it
came
out
on
the
other
side
,
well
and
good
;
if
not
she
always
took
care
to
have
her
hand
on
the
bell
-
rope
,
and
meant
to
call
out
John
and
Harry
,
just
as
if
she
expected
men
-
servants
to
answer
her
ring
.
  
<EOS>
We
all
applauded
this
ingenious
contrivance
,
and
Miss
Matty
sank
back
into
satisfied
silence
,
with
a
look
at
Mrs
Forrester
as
if
to
ask
for
HER
private
weakness
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
looked
askance
at
Miss
Pole
,
and
tried
to
change
the
subject
a
little
by
telling
us
that
she
had
borrowed
a
boy
from
one
of
the
neighbouring
cottages
and
promised
his
parents
a
hundredweight
of
coals
at
Christmas
,
and
his
supper
every
evening
,
for
the
loan
of
him
at
nights
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
instructed
him
in
his
possible
duties
when
he
first
came
;
and
,
finding
him
sensible
<EOS>
,
she
had
given
him
the
Major
's
sword
(
the
Major
was
her
late
husband
)
,
and
desired
him
to
put
it
very
carefully
behind
his
pillow
at
night
,
turning
the
edge
towards
the
head
of
the
pillow
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
sharp
lad
<EOS>
,
she
was
sure
;
for
,
spying
out
the
Major
's
cocked
hat
,
he
had
said
,
if
he
might
have
that
to
wear
,
he
was
sure
he
could
frighten
two
Englishmen
,
or
four
Frenchmen
any
day
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
had
impressed
upon
him
anew
that
he
was
to
lose
no
time
in
putting
on
hats
or
anything
else
;
but
,
if
he
heard
any
noise
,
he
was
to
run
at
it
with
his
drawn
sword
.
 
<EOS>
On
my
suggesting
that
some
accident
might
occur
from
such
slaughterous
and
indiscriminate
directions
,
and
that
he
might
rush
on
Jenny
getting
up
to
wash
,
and
have
spitted
her
<EOS>
before
he
had
discovered
that
she
was
not
a
Frenchman
,
Mrs
Forrester
said
she
did
not
think
that
that
was
likely
,
for
he
was
a
very
sound
sleeper
,
and
generally
had
to
be
well
shaken
or
cold
-
pigged
in
a
morning
before
they
could
rouse
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
sometimes
thought
such
dead
sleep
must
be
owing
to
the
hearty
suppers
the
poor
lad
ate
,
for
he
was
half
-
starved
at
home
,
and
she
told
Jenny
to
see
that
he
got
a
good
meal
at
night
.
  
<EOS>
Still
this
was
no
confession
of
Mrs
Forrester
's
peculiar
timidity
,
and
we
urged
her
to
tell
us
what
she
thought
would
frighten
her
more
than
anything
.
 
<EOS>
She
paused
,
and
stirred
the
fire
,
and
snuffed
the
candles
,
and
then
she
said
,
in
a
sounding
whisper
     
"
Ghosts
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
looked
at
Miss
Pole
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
she
had
declared
it
,
and
would
stand
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
look
was
a
challenge
in
itself
.
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
came
down
upon
her
with
indigestion
,
spectral
illusions
,
optical
delusions
,
and
a
great
deal
out
of
Dr
Ferrier
and
Dr
Hibbert
besides
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
had
rather
a
leaning
to
ghosts
,
as
I
have
mentioned
before
,
and
what
little
she
did
say
was
all
on
Mrs
Forrester
's
side
,
who
,
emboldened
by
sympathy
,
protested
that
ghosts
were
a
part
of
her
religion
;
that
surely
she
,
the
widow
of
a
major
in
the
army
,
knew
what
to
be
frightened
at
,
and
what
not
;
in
short
,
I
never
saw
Mrs
Forrester
so
warm
either
before
or
since
,
for
she
was
a
gentle
,
meek
,
enduring
old
lady
in
most
things
.
 
<EOS>
Not
all
the
elder
-
wine
that
ever
was
mulled
<EOS>
could
this
night
wash
out
the
remembrance
of
this
difference
between
Miss
Pole
and
her
hostess
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
when
the
elder
-
wine
was
brought
in
,
it
gave
rise
to
a
new
burst
of
discussion
;
for
Jenny
,
the
little
maiden
who
staggered
under
the
tray
,
had
to
give
evidence
of
having
seen
a
ghost
with
her
own
eyes
,
not
so
many
nights
ago
,
in
Darkness
Lane
,
the
very
lane
we
were
to
go
through
on
our
way
home
.
  
<EOS>
In
spite
of
the
uncomfortable
feeling
which
this
last
consideration
gave
me
,
I
could
not
help
being
amused
at
Jenny
's
position
,
which
was
exceedingly
like
that
of
a
witness
being
examined
and
cross
-
examined
by
two
counsel
who
are
not
at
all
scrupulous
about
asking
leading
questions
.
 
<EOS>
The
conclusion
I
arrived
at
was
,
that
Jenny
had
certainly
seen
something
beyond
what
a
fit
of
indigestion
would
have
caused
.
 
<EOS>
A
lady
all
in
white
,
and
without
her
head
,
was
what
she
deposed
and
adhered
to
,
supported
by
a
consciousness
of
the
secret
sympathy
of
her
mistress
under
the
withering
scorn
with
which
Miss
Pole
regarded
her
.
 
<EOS>
And
not
only
she
,
but
many
others
,
had
seen
this
headless
lady
,
who
sat
by
the
roadside
wringing
her
hands
as
in
deep
grief
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
looked
at
us
from
time
to
time
with
an
air
of
conscious
triumph
;
but
then
she
had
not
to
pass
through
Darkness
Lane
before
she
could
bury
herself
beneath
her
own
familiar
bed
-
clothes
.
  
<EOS>
We
preserved
a
discreet
silence
as
to
the
headless
lady
while
we
were
putting
on
our
things
to
go
home
,
for
there
was
no
knowing
how
near
the
ghostly
head
and
ears
might
be
,
or
what
spiritual
connection
they
might
be
keeping
up
with
the
unhappy
body
in
Darkness
Lane
;
and
,
therefore
,
even
Miss
Pole
felt
that
it
was
as
well
not
to
speak
lightly
on
such
subjects
,
for
fear
of
vexing
or
insulting
that
woebegone
trunk
.
 
<EOS>
At
least
,
so
I
conjecture
;
for
,
instead
of
the
busy
clatter
usual
in
the
operation
,
we
tied
on
our
cloaks
as
sadly
as
mutes
at
a
funeral
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
drew
the
curtains
round
the
windows
of
the
chair
to
shut
out
disagreeable
sights
,
and
the
men
(
either
because
they
were
in
spirits
that
their
labours
were
so
nearly
ended
,
or
because
they
were
going
down
hill
)
,
set
off
at
such
a
round
and
merry
pace
,
that
it
was
all
Miss
Pole
and
I
could
do
to
keep
up
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
breath
for
nothing
beyond
an
imploring
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
leave
me
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
uttered
as
she
clutched
my
arm
so
tightly
that
I
could
not
have
quitted
her
,
ghost
or
no
ghost
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
relief
it
was
when
the
men
,
weary
of
their
burden
and
their
quick
trot
,
stopped
just
where
Headingley
Causeway
branches
off
from
Darkness
Lane
!
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
unloosed
me
and
caught
at
one
of
the
men
     
"
Could
not
you
 
could
not
you
take
Miss
Matty
round
by
Headingley
Causeway
?
 
<EOS>
the
pavement
in
Darkness
Lane
jolts
so
,
and
she
is
not
very
strong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
smothered
voice
was
heard
from
the
inside
of
the
chair
     
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
pray
go
on
!
 
<EOS>
What
is
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
sixpence
more
to
go
on
very
fast
;
pray
do
n't
stop
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
'll
give
you
a
shilling
,
"
said
Miss
Pole
,
with
tremulous
dignity
,
"
if
you
'll
go
by
Headingley
Causeway
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
two
men
grunted
acquiescence
and
took
up
the
chair
,
and
went
along
the
causeway
,
which
certainly
answered
Miss
Pole
's
kind
purpose
of
saving
Miss
Matty
's
bones
;
for
it
was
covered
with
soft
,
thick
mud
,
and
even
a
fall
there
would
have
been
easy
till
the
getting
-
up
came
,
when
there
might
have
been
some
difficulty
in
extrication
.

SAMUEL
BROWN
 
<EOS>
The
next
morning
I
met
Lady
Glenmire
and
Miss
Pole
setting
out
on
a
long
walk
to
find
some
old
woman
who
was
famous
in
the
neighbourhood
for
her
skill
in
knitting
woollen
stockings
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
said
to
me
,
with
a
smile
half
-
kindly
and
half
-
contemptuous
upon
her
countenance
,
"
I
have
been
just
telling
Lady
Glenmire
of
our
poor
friend
Mrs
Forrester
,
and
her
terror
of
ghosts
.
 
<EOS>
It
comes
from
living
so
much
alone
,
and
listening
to
the
bug
-
a
-
boo
stories
of
that
Jenny
of
hers
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
She
was
so
calm
and
so
much
above
superstitious
fears
herself
that
I
was
almost
ashamed
to
say
how
glad
I
had
been
of
her
Headingley
Causeway
proposition
the
night
before
,
and
turned
off
the
conversation
to
something
else
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
afternoon
Miss
Pole
called
on
Miss
Matty
to
tell
her
of
the
adventure
 
the
real
adventure
they
had
met
with
on
their
morning
's
walk
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
been
perplexed
about
the
exact
path
which
they
were
to
take
across
the
fields
in
order
to
find
the
knitting
old
woman
,
and
had
stopped
to
inquire
at
a
little
wayside
public
-
house
,
standing
on
the
high
road
to
London
,
about
three
miles
from
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
The
good
woman
had
asked
them
to
sit
down
and
rest
themselves
while
she
fetched
her
husband
,
who
could
direct
them
better
than
she
could
;
and
,
while
they
were
sitting
in
the
sanded
parlour
,
a
little
girl
came
in
.
 
<EOS>
They
thought
that
she
belonged
to
the
landlady
,
and
began
some
trifling
conversation
with
her
;
but
,
on
Mrs
Roberts
's
return
,
she
told
them
that
the
little
thing
was
the
only
child
of
a
couple
who
were
staying
in
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
she
began
a
long
story
,
out
of
which
Lady
Glenmire
and
Miss
Pole
could
only
gather
one
or
two
decided
facts
,
which
were
that
,
about
six
weeks
ago
,
a
light
spring
-
cart
had
broken
down
just
before
their
door
,
in
which
there
were
two
men
,
one
woman
,
and
this
child
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
men
was
seriously
hurt
 
no
bones
broken
,
only
"
shaken
,
"
the
landlady
called
it
;
but
he
had
probably
sustained
some
severe
internal
injury
,
for
he
had
languished
in
their
house
ever
since
,
attended
by
his
wife
,
the
mother
of
this
little
girl
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
had
asked
what
he
was
,
what
he
looked
like
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mrs
Roberts
had
made
answer
that
he
was
not
like
a
gentleman
,
nor
yet
like
a
common
person
;
if
it
had
not
been
that
he
and
his
wife
were
such
decent
,
quiet
people
,
she
could
almost
have
thought
he
was
a
mountebank
,
or
something
of
that
kind
,
for
they
had
a
great
box
in
the
cart
,
full
of
she
<EOS>
did
not
know
what
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
helped
to
unpack
it
,
and
take
out
their
linen
and
clothes
,
when
the
other
man
 
his
twin
-
brother
,
she
believed
he
was
 
had
gone
off
with
the
horse
and
cart
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
had
begun
to
have
her
suspicions
at
this
point
,
and
expressed
her
idea
that
it
was
rather
strange
that
the
box
and
cart
and
horse
and
all
should
have
disappeared
;
but
good
Mrs
Roberts
seemed
to
have
become
quite
indignant
at
Miss
Pole
's
implied
suggestion
;
in
fact
,
Miss
Pole
said
she
was
as
angry
as
if
Miss
Pole
had
told
her
that
she
herself
was
a
swindler
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
best
way
of
convincing
the
ladies
,
she
bethought
her
of
begging
them
to
see
the
wife
;
and
,
as
Miss
Pole
said
,
there
was
no
doubting
the
honest
,
worn
,
bronzed
face
of
the
woman
,
who
at
the
first
tender
word
from
Lady
Glenmire
,
burst
into
tears
,
which
she
was
too
weak
to
check
until
some
word
from
the
landlady
made
her
swallow
down
her
sobs
,
in
order
that
she
might
testify
to
the
Christian
kindness
shown
by
Mr
and
Mrs
Roberts
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
came
round
with
a
swing
to
as
vehement
a
belief
in
the
sorrowful
tale
as
she
had
been
sceptical
before
;
and
,
as
a
proof
of
this
,
her
energy
in
the
poor
sufferer
's
behalf
was
nothing
daunted
when
she
found
out
that
he
,
and
no
other
,
was
our
Signor
Brunoni
,
to
whom
all
Cranford
had
been
attributing
all
manner
of
evil
this
six
weeks
past
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
his
wife
said
his
proper
name
was
Samuel
Brown
 
<EOS>
"
Sam
,
"
<EOS>
she
called
him
 
but
to
the
last
we
preferred
calling
him
"
the
Signor
"
;
it
sounded
so
much
better
.
  
<EOS>
The
end
of
their
conversation
with
the
Signora
Brunoni
was
that
it
was
agreed
that
he
should
be
placed
under
medical
advice
,
and
for
any
expense
incurred
in
procuring
this
Lady
Glenmire
promised
to
hold
herself
responsible
,
and
had
accordingly
gone
to
Mr
Hoggins
to
beg
him
to
ride
over
to
the
"
Rising
Sun
"
that
very
afternoon
,
and
examine
into
the
signor
's
real
state
;
and
,
as
Miss
Pole
said
,
if
it
was
desirable
to
remove
him
to
Cranford
to
be
more
immediately
under
Mr
Hoggins
's
eye
,
she
would
undertake
to
see
for
lodgings
and
arrange
about
the
rent
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Roberts
had
been
as
kind
as
could
be
all
throughout
,
but
it
was
evident
that
their
long
residence
there
had
been
a
slight
inconvenience
.
  
<EOS>
Before
Miss
Pole
left
us
,
Miss
Matty
and
I
were
as
full
of
the
morning
's
adventure
as
she
was
.
 
<EOS>
We
talked
about
it
all
the
evening
,
turning
it
in
every
possible
light
,
and
we
went
to
bed
anxious
for
the
morning
,
when
we
should
surely
hear
from
someone
what
Mr
Hoggins
thought
and
recommended
;
for
,
as
Miss
Matty
observed
,
though
Mr
Hoggins
did
say
"
Jack
's
up
,
"
"
a
fig
for
his
heels
,
"
and
called
Preference
"
Pref
.
<EOS>
"
she
believed
he
was
a
very
worthy
man
and
a
very
clever
surgeon
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
we
were
rather
proud
of
our
doctor
at
Cranford
,
as
a
doctor
.
 
<EOS>
We
often
wished
,
when
we
heard
of
Queen
Adelaide
or
the
Duke
of
Wellington
being
ill
,
that
they
would
send
for
Mr
Hoggins
;
but
,
on
consideration
,
we
were
rather
glad
they
did
not
,
for
,
if
we
were
ailing
,
what
should
we
do
if
Mr
Hoggins
had
been
appointed
physician
-
in
-
ordinary
to
the
Royal
Family
?
 
<EOS>
As
a
surgeon
we
were
proud
of
him
;
but
as
a
man
 
or
rather
,
I
should
say
,
as
a
gentleman
 
<EOS>
we
could
only
shake
our
heads
over
his
name
and
himself
,
and
wished
that
he
had
read
Lord
Chesterfield
's
Letters
in
the
days
when
his
manners
were
susceptible
of
improvement
.
 
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
we
all
regarded
his
dictum
in
the
signor
's
case
as
infallible
,
and
when
he
said
that
with
care
and
attention
he
might
rally
,
we
had
no
more
fear
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
although
we
had
no
more
fear
,
everybody
did
as
much
as
if
there
was
great
cause
for
anxiety
 
as
indeed
there
was
until
Mr
Hoggins
took
charge
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
looked
out
clean
and
comfortable
,
if
homely
,
lodgings
;
Miss
Matty
sent
the
sedan
-
chair
for
him
,
and
Martha
and
I
aired
it
well
before
it
left
Cranford
by
holding
a
warming
-
pan
full
of
red
-
hot
coals
in
it
,
and
then
shutting
it
up
close
,
smoke
and
all
,
until
the
time
when
he
should
get
into
it
at
the
"
Rising
Sun
.
"
 
<EOS>
Lady
Glenmire
undertook
the
medical
department
under
Mr
Hoggins
's
directions
,
and
rummaged
up
all
Mrs
Jamieson
's
medicine
glasses
,
and
spoons
,
and
bed
-
tables
,
in
a
free
-
and
-
easy
way
,
that
made
Miss
Matty
feel
a
little
anxious
as
to
what
that
lady
and
Mr
Mulliner
might
say
,
if
they
knew
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
made
some
of
the
bread
-
jelly
,
for
which
she
was
so
famous
,
to
have
ready
as
a
refreshment
in
the
lodgings
when
he
should
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
A
present
of
this
bread
-
jelly
was
the
highest
mark
of
favour
<EOS>
dear
Mrs
Forrester
could
confer
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
had
once
asked
her
for
the
receipt
,
but
she
had
met
with
a
very
decided
rebuff
;
that
lady
told
her
that
she
could
not
part
with
it
to
any
one
during
her
life
,
and
that
after
her
death
it
was
bequeathed
,
as
her
executors
would
find
,
to
Miss
Matty
.
 
<EOS>
What
Miss
Matty
,
or
,
as
Mrs
Forrester
called
her
(
remembering
the
clause
in
her
will
and
the
dignity
of
the
occasion
)
,
Miss
Matilda
Jenkyns
 
might
choose
to
do
with
the
receipt
when
it
came
into
her
possession
 
whether
to
make
it
public
,
or
to
hand
it
down
as
an
heirloom
 
she
did
not
know
,
nor
would
she
dictate
.
 
<EOS>
And
a
mould
of
this
admirable
<EOS>
,
digestible
,
unique
bread
-
jelly
was
sent
by
Mrs
Forrester
to
our
poor
sick
conjuror
.
 
<EOS>
Who
says
that
the
aristocracy
are
proud
?
 
<EOS>
Here
was
a
lady
by
birth
a
Tyrrell
,
and
descended
from
the
great
Sir
Walter
that
shot
King
Rufus
,
and
in
whose
veins
ran
the
blood
of
him
who
murdered
the
little
princes
in
the
Tower
,
going
every
day
to
see
what
dainty
dishes
she
could
prepare
for
Samuel
Brown
,
a
mountebank
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
it
was
wonderful
to
see
what
kind
feelings
were
called
out
by
this
poor
man
's
coming
amongst
us
.
 
<EOS>
And
also
wonderful
to
see
how
the
great
Cranford
panic
,
which
had
been
occasioned
by
his
first
coming
in
his
Turkish
dress
,
melted
away
into
thin
air
on
his
second
coming
 
pale
and
feeble
,
and
with
his
heavy
,
filmy
eyes
,
that
only
brightened
a
very
little
when
they
fell
upon
the
countenance
of
his
faithful
wife
,
or
their
pale
and
sorrowful
little
girl
.
  
<EOS>
Somehow
we
all
forgot
to
be
afraid
.
 
<EOS>
I
daresay
it
was
that
finding
out
that
he
,
who
had
first
excited
our
love
of
the
marvellous
by
his
unprecedented
arts
,
had
not
sufficient
every
-
day
gifts
to
manage
a
shying
horse
,
made
us
feel
as
if
we
were
ourselves
again
.
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
came
with
her
little
basket
at
all
hours
of
the
evening
,
as
if
her
lonely
house
and
the
unfrequented
road
to
it
had
never
been
infested
by
that
"
murderous
gang
"
;
Mrs
Forrester
said
she
thought
that
neither
Jenny
nor
she
need
mind
the
headless
lady
who
wept
and
wailed
in
Darkness
Lane
,
for
surely
<EOS>
the
power
was
never
given
to
such
beings
to
harm
those
who
went
about
to
try
to
do
what
little
good
was
in
their
power
,
to
which
Jenny
tremblingly
assented
;
but
the
mistress
's
theory
had
little
effect
on
the
maid
's
practice
until
she
had
sewn
two
pieces
of
red
flannel
in
the
shape
of
a
cross
on
her
inner
garment
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
Miss
Matty
covering
her
penny
ball
 
<EOS>
the
ball
that
she
used
to
roll
under
her
bed
 
with
gay
-
coloured
worsted
in
rainbow
stripes
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
she
,
"
my
heart
is
sad
for
that
little
careworn
child
.
 
<EOS>
Although
her
father
is
a
conjuror
,
she
looks
as
if
she
had
never
had
a
good
game
of
play
in
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
used
to
make
very
pretty
balls
in
this
way
when
I
was
a
girl
,
and
I
thought
I
would
try
if
I
could
not
make
this
one
smart
and
take
it
to
Phoebe
this
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
"
the
gang
"
must
have
left
the
neighbourhood
,
for
one
does
not
hear
any
more
of
their
violence
and
robbery
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
were
all
of
us
far
too
full
of
the
signor
's
precarious
state
to
talk
either
about
robbers
or
ghosts
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Lady
Glenmire
said
she
never
had
heard
of
any
actual
robberies
,
except
that
two
little
boys
had
stolen
some
apples
from
Farmer
Benson
's
orchard
,
and
that
some
eggs
had
been
missed
on
a
market
-
day
off
Widow
Hayward
's
stall
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
was
expecting
too
much
of
us
;
we
could
not
acknowledge
that
we
had
only
had
this
small
foundation
for
all
our
panic
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
drew
herself
up
at
this
remark
of
Lady
Glenmire
's
,
and
said
"
that
she
wished
she
could
agree
with
her
as
to
the
very
small
reason
we
had
had
for
alarm
,
but
with
the
recollection
of
a
man
disguised
as
a
woman
who
had
endeavoured
to
force
himself
into
her
house
while
his
confederates
waited
outside
;
with
the
knowledge
gained
from
Lady
Glenmire
herself
,
of
the
footprints
seen
on
Mrs
Jamieson
's
flower
borders
;
with
the
fact
before
her
of
the
audacious
robbery
committed
on
Mr
Hoggins
at
his
own
door
"
 
B
ut
here
<EOS>
Lady
Glenmire
broke
in
with
a
very
strong
expression
of
doubt
as
to
whether
this
last
story
was
not
an
entire
fabrication
founded
upon
the
theft
of
a
cat
;
she
grew
so
red
while
she
was
saying
all
this
that
I
was
not
surprised
at
Miss
Pole
's
manner
of
bridling
up
,
and
I
am
certain
,
if
Lady
Glenmire
had
not
been
"
her
ladyship
,
"
we
should
have
had
a
more
emphatic
contradiction
than
the
"
Well
,
to
be
sure
!
"
and
similar
fragmentary
ejaculations
,
which
were
all
that
she
ventured
upon
in
my
lady
's
presence
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
she
was
gone
Miss
Pole
began
a
long
congratulation
to
Miss
Matty
that
so
far
they
had
escaped
marriage
,
which
she
noticed
always
made
people
credulous
to
the
last
degree
;
indeed
,
she
thought
it
argued
great
natural
credulity
in
a
woman
if
she
could
not
keep
herself
from
being
married
;
and
in
what
Lady
Glenmire
had
said
about
Mr
Hoggins
's
robbery
we
had
a
specimen
of
what
people
came
to
if
they
gave
way
to
such
a
weakness
;
evidently
Lady
Glenmire
would
swallow
anything
if
she
could
believe
the
poor
vamped
-
up
story
about
a
neck
of
mutton
and
a
pussy
with
which
he
had
tried
to
impose
on
Miss
Pole
,
only
she
had
always
been
on
her
guard
against
believing
too
much
of
what
men
said
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
thankful
,
as
Miss
Pole
desired
us
to
be
,
that
we
had
never
been
married
;
but
I
think
,
of
the
two
,
we
were
even
more
thankful
that
the
robbers
had
left
Cranford
;
at
least
I
judge
so
from
a
speech
of
Miss
Matty
's
that
evening
,
as
we
sat
over
the
fire
,
in
which
she
evidently
looked
upon
a
husband
as
a
great
protector
against
thieves
,
burglars
,
and
ghosts
;
and
said
that
she
did
not
think
that
she
should
dare
to
be
always
warning
young
people
against
matrimony
,
as
Miss
Pole
did
continually
;
to
be
sure
,
marriage
was
a
risk
,
as
she
saw
,
now
she
had
had
some
experience
;
but
she
remembered
the
time
when
she
had
looked
forward
to
being
married
as
much
as
any
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
to
any
particular
person
,
my
dear
,
"
said
she
,
hastily
checking
herself
up
,
as
if
she
were
afraid
of
having
admitted
too
much
;
"
only
the
old
story
,
you
know
,
of
ladies
always
saying
,
"
WHEN
I
marry
,
"
and
gentlemen
,
"
IF
I
marry
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
joke
spoken
in
rather
a
sad
tone
,
and
I
doubt
if
either
of
us
smiled
;
but
I
could
not
see
Miss
Matty
's
face
by
the
flickering
fire
-
light
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
little
while
she
continued
     
<EOS>
"
But
,
after
all
,
I
have
not
told
you
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
so
long
ago
,
and
no
one
ever
knew
how
much
I
thought
of
it
at
the
time
,
unless
,
indeed
,
my
dear
mother
guessed
;
but
I
may
say
that
there
was
a
time
when
I
did
not
think
I
should
have
been
only
Miss
Matty
Jenkyns
all
my
life
;
for
even
if
I
did
meet
with
any
one
who
wished
to
marry
me
now
(
and
,
as
Miss
Pole
says
,
one
is
never
too
safe
)
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
take
him
 
<EOS>
I
hope
he
would
not
take
it
too
much
to
heart
,
but
I
could
NOT
take
him
 
or
any
one
but
<EOS>
the
person
I
once
thought
I
should
be
married
to
;
and
he
is
dead
and
gone
,
and
he
never
knew
how
it
all
came
about
<EOS>
that
I
said
"
No
,
"
when
I
had
thought
many
and
many
a
time
 
<EOS>
Well
,
it
's
no
matter
what
I
thought
.
 
<EOS>
God
ordains
it
all
,
and
I
am
very
happy
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
has
such
kind
friends
as
I
,
"
continued
she
,
taking
my
hand
and
holding
it
in
hers
.
  
<EOS>
If
I
had
never
known
of
Mr
Holbrook
,
I
could
have
said
something
in
this
pause
,
but
as
I
had
,
I
could
not
think
of
anything
that
would
come
in
naturally
,
and
so
we
both
kept
silence
for
a
little
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
once
made
us
,
"
she
began
,
"
keep
a
diary
,
in
two
columns
;
on
one
side
we
were
to
put
down
in
the
morning
what
we
thought
would
be
the
course
and
events
of
the
coming
day
,
and
at
night
we
were
to
put
down
on
the
other
side
what
really
had
happened
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
to
some
people
rather
a
sad
way
of
telling
their
lives
,
"
(
a
tear
dropped
upon
my
hand
at
these
words
)
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
that
mine
has
been
sad
,
only
so
very
different
to
what
I
expected
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
,
one
winter
's
evening
,
sitting
over
our
bedroom
fire
with
Deborah
 
<EOS>
I
remember
it
as
if
it
were
yesterday
 
<EOS>
and
we
were
planning
our
future
lives
<EOS>
,
both
of
us
were
planning
,
though
only
she
talked
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
she
should
like
to
marry
an
archdeacon
,
and
write
his
charges
;
and
you
know
,
my
dear
,
she
never
was
married
,
and
,
for
aught
I
know
,
she
never
spoke
to
an
unmarried
archdeacon
in
her
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
never
was
ambitious
,
nor
could
I
have
written
charges
,
but
I
thought
I
could
manage
a
house
(
my
mother
used
to
call
me
her
right
hand
)
,
and
I
was
always
so
fond
of
little
children
 
<EOS>
the
shyest
babies
would
stretch
out
their
little
arms
to
come
to
me
;
when
I
was
a
girl
,
I
was
half
my
leisure
time
nursing
in
the
neighbouring
cottages
;
but
I
do
n't
know
how
it
was
,
when
I
grew
sad
and
grave
 
<EOS>
which
I
did
a
year
or
two
after
this
time
 
the
little
things
drew
back
from
me
,
and
I
am
afraid
I
lost
the
knack
,
though
I
am
just
as
fond
of
children
as
ever
,
and
have
a
strange
yearning
at
my
heart
whenever
I
see
a
mother
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
my
dear
"
(
and
by
a
sudden
blaze
which
sprang
up
from
a
fall
of
the
unstirred
coals
,
I
saw
that
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
 
gazing
intently
on
some
vision
of
what
might
have
been
)
,
"
do
you
know
<EOS>
I
dream
sometimes
that
I
have
a
little
child
 
<EOS>
always
the
same
 
a
little
girl
of
about
two
years
old
;
she
never
grows
older
,
though
I
have
dreamt
about
her
for
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
ever
dream
of
any
words
or
sound
she
makes
;
she
is
very
noiseless
and
still
,
but
she
comes
to
me
when
she
is
very
sorry
or
very
glad
,
and
I
have
wakened
with
<EOS>
the
clasp
of
her
dear
little
arms
round
my
neck
.
 
<EOS>
Only
last
night
 
perhaps
because
I
had
gone
to
sleep
thinking
of
this
ball
for
Phoebe
 
<EOS>
my
little
darling
came
in
my
dream
,
and
put
up
her
mouth
to
be
kissed
,
just
as
I
have
seen
real
babies
do
to
real
mothers
before
going
to
bed
.
 
<EOS>
But
all
this
is
nonsense
,
dear
!
<EOS>
only
do
n't
be
frightened
by
Miss
Pole
from
being
married
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
fancy
<EOS>
it
may
be
a
very
happy
state
,
and
a
little
credulity
helps
one
on
through
life
very
smoothly
 
better
than
always
doubting
and
doubting
and
seeing
difficulties
and
disagreeables
in
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
inclined
to
be
daunted
from
matrimony
,
it
would
not
have
been
Miss
Pole
to
do
it
;
it
would
have
been
the
lot
of
poor
Signor
Brunoni
and
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
again
,
it
was
an
encouragement
to
see
how
,
through
all
their
cares
and
sorrows
,
they
thought
of
each
other
and
not
of
themselves
;
and
how
keen
were
their
joys
,
if
they
only
passed
through
each
other
,
or
through
the
little
Phoebe
.
  
<EOS>
The
signora
told
me
,
one
day
,
a
good
deal
about
their
lives
up
to
this
period
.
 
<EOS>
It
began
by
my
asking
her
whether
Miss
Pole
's
story
of
the
twin
-
brothers
were
true
;
it
sounded
so
wonderful
a
likeness
,
that
I
should
have
had
my
doubts
,
if
Miss
Pole
had
not
been
unmarried
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
signora
,
or
(
as
we
found
out
she
preferred
to
be
called
)
<EOS>
Mrs
Brown
,
said
it
was
quite
true
;
that
her
brother
-
in-
law
was
by
many
taken
for
her
husband
,
which
was
of
great
assistance
to
them
in
their
profession
;
"
though
,
"
she
continued
,
"
how
people
can
mistake
Thomas
for
the
real
Signor
Brunoni
,
I
ca
n't
conceive
;
but
he
says
they
do
;
so
I
suppose
I
must
believe
him
.
<EOS>
Not
but
what
he
is
a
very
good
man
;
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
know
how
we
should
have
paid
our
bill
at
the
"
Rising
Sun
"
but
for
the
money
he
sends
;
but
people
must
know
very
little
about
art
if
they
can
take
him
for
my
husband
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
Miss
,
in
the
ball
trick
,
where
my
husband
spreads
his
fingers
wide
,
and
throws
out
his
little
finger
with
quite
an
air
and
a
grace
,
Thomas
just
clumps
up
his
hand
like
a
fist
,
and
might
have
ever
so
many
balls
hidden
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
has
never
been
in
India
,
and
knows
nothing
of
the
proper
sit
of
a
turban
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
been
in
India
?
<EOS>
"
said
I
,
rather
astonished
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
!
<EOS>
many
a
year
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
Sam
was
a
sergeant
in
the
31st
;
and
when
the
regiment
was
ordered
to
India
,
I
drew
a
lot
to
go
,
and
I
was
more
thankful
than
I
can
tell
;
for
it
seemed
as
if
it
would
only
be
a
slow
death
to
me
to
part
from
my
husband
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
ma'am
,
if
I
had
known
all
,
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
would
not
rather
have
died
there
and
then
than
gone
through
what
I
have
done
since
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
I
've
been
able
to
comfort
Sam
,
and
to
be
with
him
;
but
,
ma'am
,
I
've
lost
six
children
,
"
said
she
,
looking
up
at
me
with
those
strange
eyes
that
I
've
never
noticed
but
in
mothers
of
dead
children
 
with
a
kind
of
wild
look
in
them
,
as
if
seeking
for
what
they
never
more
might
find
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
 
<EOS>
Six
children
died
off
,
like
little
buds
nipped
untimely
,
in
that
cruel
India
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
,
as
each
died
,
I
never
could
 
<EOS>
I
never
would
 
love
a
child
again
;
and
when
the
next
came
,
it
had
not
only
its
own
love
,
but
the
deeper
love
that
came
from
the
thoughts
of
its
little
dead
brothers
and
sisters
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
Phoebe
was
coming
,
I
said
to
my
husband
,
"
Sam
,
when
the
child
is
born
,
and
I
am
strong
,
I
shall
leave
you
;
it
will
cut
my
heart
cruel
;
but
if
this
baby
dies
too
,
I
shall
go
mad
;
the
madness
is
in
me
now
;
but
if
you
let
me
go
down
to
Calcutta
,
carrying
my
baby
step
by
step
,
it
will
,
maybe
,
work
itself
off
;
and
I
will
save
,
and
I
will
hoard
,
and
I
will
beg
 
and
I
will
die
,
to
get
a
passage
home
to
England
,
where
our
baby
may
live
?
"
 
<EOS>
God
bless
him
!
<EOS>
he
said
I
might
go
;
and
he
saved
up
his
pay
,
and
I
saved
every
pice
I
could
get
for
washing
or
any
way
;
and
when
Phoebe
came
,
and
I
grew
strong
again
,
I
set
off
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
lonely
;
through
the
thick
forests
,
dark
again
with
their
heavy
trees
 
along
by
the
river
's
side
(
but
I
had
been
brought
up
near
the
Avon
in
Warwickshire
,
so
that
flowing
noise
sounded
like
home
)
 
from
station
to
station
,
from
Indian
village
to
village
<EOS>
,
I
went
along
,
carrying
my
child
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
seen
one
of
the
officer
's
ladies
with
a
little
picture
,
<EOS>
ma'am
 
done
by
a
Catholic
foreigner
,
ma'am
 
of
the
Virgin
and
the
little
Saviour
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
him
on
her
arm
,
and
her
form
was
softly
curled
round
him
,
and
their
cheeks
touched
.
<EOS>
Well
,
when
I
went
to
bid
good
-
bye
to
this
lady
,
for
whom
I
had
washed
,
she
cried
sadly
;
for
she
,
too
,
had
lost
her
children
,
but
she
had
not
another
to
save
,
like
me
;
and
I
was
bold
enough
to
ask
her
would
she
give
me
that
print
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
cried
the
more
,
and
said
her
children
were
with
that
little
blessed
Jesus
;
and
gave
it
me
,
and
told
me
that
she
had
heard
it
had
been
painted
on
the
bottom
of
a
cask
,
which
made
it
have
that
round
shape
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
my
body
was
very
weary
,
and
my
heart
was
sick
(
for
there
were
times
when
I
misdoubted
if
I
could
ever
reach
my
home
,
and
there
were
times
when
I
thought
of
my
husband
,
and
<EOS>
one
time
when
I
thought
my
baby
was
dying
)
,
I
took
out
that
picture
and
looked
at
it
,
till
I
could
have
thought
the
mother
spoke
to
me
,
and
comforted
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
natives
were
very
kind
.
 
<EOS>
We
could
not
understand
one
another
;
but
they
saw
my
baby
on
my
breast
,
and
they
came
out
to
me
,
and
brought
me
rice
and
milk
,
and
sometimes
flowers
 
<EOS>
I
have
got
some
of
the
flowers
dried
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
next
morning
,
I
was
so
tired
;
and
they
wanted
me
to
stay
with
them
 
<EOS>
I
could
tell
that
 
and
tried
to
frighten
me
from
going
into
the
deep
woods
,
which
,
indeed
,
looked
very
strange
and
dark
;
but
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
Death
was
following
me
to
take
my
baby
away
from
me
;
and
as
if
I
must
go
on
,
and
on
 
<EOS>
and
I
thought
how
God
had
cared
for
mothers
ever
since
the
world
was
made
,
and
would
care
for
me
;
so
I
bade
them
good
-
bye
,
and
set
off
afresh
.
<EOS>
And
once
when
my
baby
was
ill
,
and
both
she
and
I
needed
rest
,
He
led
me
to
a
place
where
I
found
a
kind
Englishman
lived
,
right
in
the
midst
of
the
natives
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
reached
Calcutta
safely
at
last
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
safely
!
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
when
I
knew
I
had
only
two
days
'
journey
more
before
me
,
I
could
not
help
it
,
ma'am
 
<EOS>
it
might
be
idolatry
,
I
can
not
tell
 
<EOS>
but
I
was
near
one
of
the
native
temples
,
and
I
went
into
it
with
my
baby
to
thank
God
for
His
great
mercy
;
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
where
others
had
prayed
before
to
their
God
,
in
their
joy
or
in
their
agony
,
was
of
itself
a
sacred
place
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
got
as
servant
to
an
invalid
lady
,
who
grew
quite
fond
of
my
baby
aboard
-
ship
;
and
,
in
two
years
'
time
,
Sam
earned
his
discharge
,
and
came
home
to
me
,
and
to
our
child
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
had
to
fix
on
a
trade
;
but
he
knew
of
none
;
and
once
,
once
upon
a
time
,
he
had
learnt
some
tricks
from
an
Indian
juggler
;
so
he
set
up
conjuring
,
and
it
answered
so
well
that
he
took
Thomas
to
help
him
 
as
his
man
,
you
know
,
not
as
another
conjuror
,
though
Thomas
has
set
it
up
now
on
his
own
hook
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
has
been
a
great
help
to
us
that
likeness
between
the
twins
,
and
made
a
good
many
tricks
go
off
well
that
they
made
up
together
.
 
<EOS>
And
Thomas
is
a
good
brother
,
<EOS>
only
he
has
not
the
fine
carriage
of
my
husband
,
so
that
I
ca
n't
think
how
he
can
be
taken
for
Signor
Brunoni
himself
,
as
he
says
he
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
little
Phoebe
!
<EOS>
"
said
I
,
my
thoughts
going
back
to
the
baby
she
carried
all
those
hundred
miles
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
may
say
so
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
thought
I
should
have
reared
her
,
though
,
when
she
fell
ill
at
Chunderabaddad
;
but
that
good
,
kind
Aga
Jenkyns
took
us
in
,
which
I
believe
was
the
very
saving
of
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jenkyns
!
<EOS>
"
said
I.
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
Jenkyns
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
think
all
people
of
that
name
are
kind
;
for
here
is
that
nice
old
lady
who
comes
every
day
to
take
Phoebe
a
walk
!
"
  
<EOS>
But
an
idea
had
flashed
through
my
head
;
could
the
Aga
Jenkyns
be
the
lost
Peter
?
 
<EOS>
True
he
was
reported
by
many
to
be
dead
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
equally
true
,
some
had
said
that
he
had
arrived
at
the
dignity
of
Great
Lama
of
Thibet
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
thought
he
was
alive
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
make
further
inquiry
.
   
<EOS>
ENGAGED
TO
BE
<EOS>
MARRIED
 
<EOS>
Was
the
"
poor
Peter
"
of
Cranford
the
Aga
Jenkyns
of
Chunderabaddad
,
or
was
he
not
?
 
<EOS>
As
somebody
says
,
that
was
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
In
my
own
home
,
whenever
people
had
nothing
else
to
do
,
they
blamed
me
for
want
of
discretion
.
 
<EOS>
Indiscretion
was
my
bug
-
bear
fault
.
<EOS>
Everybody
has
a
bug
-
bear
fault
,
a
sort
of
standing
characteristic
 
<EOS>
a
piece
de
resistance
for
their
friends
to
cut
at
;
and
in
general
they
cut
and
come
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
tired
of
being
called
indiscreet
and
incautious
;
and
I
determined
for
once
to
prove
myself
a
model
of
prudence
and
wisdom
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
even
hint
my
suspicions
respecting
the
Aga
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
collect
evidence
and
carry
it
home
to
lay
before
my
father
,
as
the
family
friend
of
the
two
Miss
Jenkynses
.
  
<EOS>
In
my
search
after
facts
,
I
was
often
reminded
of
a
description
my
father
had
once
given
of
a
ladies
'
committee
that
he
had
had
to
preside
over
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
a
passage
in
Dickens
,
which
spoke
of
a
chorus
in
which
every
man
took
the
tune
he
knew
best
,
and
sang
it
to
his
own
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
at
this
charitable
committee
,
every
lady
took
the
subject
uppermost
in
her
mind
,
and
talked
about
it
to
her
own
great
contentment
,
but
not
much
to
the
advancement
of
the
subject
they
had
met
to
discuss
.
<EOS>
But
even
that
committee
could
have
been
nothing
to
the
Cranford
ladies
when
I
attempted
to
gain
some
clear
and
definite
information
as
to
poor
Peter
's
height
,
appearance
,
and
when
and
where
he
was
seen
and
heard
of
last
.
 
<EOS>
For
instance
,
I
remember
asking
Miss
Pole
(
<EOS>
and
I
thought
the
question
was
very
opportune
,
for
I
put
it
when
I
met
her
at
a
call
at
Mrs
Forrester
's
,
and
both
the
ladies
had
known
Peter
,
and
I
imagined
that
they
might
refresh
each
other
's
memories
)
 
<EOS>
I
asked
Miss
Pole
what
was
the
very
last
thing
they
had
ever
heard
about
him
;
and
then
she
named
the
absurd
report
to
which
I
have
alluded
,
about
his
having
been
elected
Great
Lama
of
Thibet
;
and
this
was
a
signal
for
each
lady
to
go
off
on
her
separate
idea
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
's
start
was
made
on
the
veiled
prophet
in
Lalla
Rookh
 
whether
I
thought
he
was
meant
for
the
Great
Lama
,
though
Peter
was
not
so
ugly
,
indeed
rather
handsome
,
if
he
had
not
been
freckled
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
thankful
to
see
her
double
upon
Peter
;
but
,
in
a
moment
,
the
delusive
lady
was
off
upon
Rowland
's
Kalydor
,
and
the
merits
of
cosmetics
and
hair
oils
in
general
,
and
holding
forth
so
fluently
that
I
turned
to
listen
to
Miss
Pole
,
who
(
through
the
llamas
,
the
beasts
of
burden
)
had
got
to
Peruvian
bonds
,
and
the
share
market
,
and
her
poor
opinion
of
joint
-
stock
banks
in
general
,
and
of
that
one
in
particular
in
which
Miss
Matty
's
money
was
invested
.
 
<EOS>
In
vain
I
put
in
"
<EOS>
When
was
it
 
in
what
year
was
it
that
you
heard
that
Mr
Peter
was
the
Great
Lama
?
"
 
<EOS>
They
only
joined
issue
to
dispute
whether
llamas
were
carnivorous
animals
or
not
;
in
which
dispute
they
were
not
quite
on
fair
grounds
,
as
Mrs
Forrester
(
after
they
had
grown
warm
and
cool
again
)
acknowledged
that
she
always
confused
carnivorous
and
graminivorous
together
,
just
as
she
did
horizontal
and
perpendicular
;
but
then
she
apologised
for
it
very
prettily
,
by
saying
that
in
her
day
the
only
use
people
made
of
four
-
syllabled
words
was
to
teach
how
they
should
be
spelt
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
fact
I
gained
from
this
conversation
was
that
certainly
Peter
had
last
been
heard
of
in
India
,
"
or
that
neighbourhood
"
;
and
that
this
scanty
intelligence
of
his
whereabouts
had
reached
Cranford
in
the
year
when
Miss
Pole
had
brought
her
Indian
muslin
gown
,
long
since
worn
out
<EOS>
(
we
washed
it
and
mended
it
,
and
traced
its
decline
and
fall
into
a
window
-
blind
before
we
could
go
on
)
;
and
in
a
year
when
Wombwell
came
to
Cranford
,
because
Miss
Matty
had
wanted
to
see
an
elephant
in
order
that
she
might
the
better
imagine
Peter
riding
on
one
;
and
had
seen
a
boa
-
constrictor
too
,
which
was
more
than
she
wished
to
imagine
in
her
fancy
-
pictures
of
Peter
's
locality
;
and
in
a
year
when
Miss
Jenkyns
had
learnt
some
piece
of
poetry
off
by
heart
,
and
used
to
say
,
at
all
the
Cranford
parties
,
how
Peter
was
"
surveying
mankind
from
China
to
Peru
,
"
which
everybody
had
thought
very
grand
,
and
rather
appropriate
,
because
India
was
between
China
and
Peru
,
if
you
took
care
to
turn
the
globe
to
the
left
instead
of
the
right
.
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
all
these
inquiries
of
mine
,
and
the
consequent
curiosity
excited
in
the
minds
of
my
friends
,
made
us
blind
and
deaf
to
what
was
going
on
around
us
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
me
as
if
the
sun
rose
and
shone
,
and
as
if
the
rain
rained
on
Cranford
,
just
as
usual
,
and
I
did
not
notice
any
sign
of
the
times
that
could
be
considered
as
a
prognostic
of
any
uncommon
event
;
and
,
to
the
best
of
my
belief
,
not
only
Miss
Matty
and
Mrs
Forrester
,
but
even
Miss
Pole
herself
,
whom
we
looked
upon
as
a
kind
of
prophetess
,
from
the
knack
she
had
of
foreseeing
things
before
they
came
to
pass
 
although
she
did
not
like
to
disturb
her
friends
by
telling
them
her
foreknowledge
 
<EOS>
even
Miss
Pole
herself
was
breathless
with
astonishment
when
she
came
to
tell
us
of
the
astounding
piece
of
news
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
must
recover
myself
;
the
contemplation
of
it
,
even
at
this
distance
of
time
,
has
taken
away
my
breath
and
my
grammar
,
and
unless
I
subdue
my
emotion
,
my
spelling
will
go
too
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
sitting
 
Miss
Matty
<EOS>
and
I
 
much
as
usual
,
she
in
the
blue
chintz
easy
-
chair
,
with
her
back
to
the
light
,
and
<EOS>
her
knitting
in
her
hand
,
I
reading
aloud
<EOS>
the
St
James
's
Chronicle
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
more
,
<EOS>
and
we
should
have
gone
to
make
the
little
alterations
in
dress
usual
before
calling
-
time
(
twelve
o'clock
)
in
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
the
scene
and
the
date
well
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
been
talking
of
the
signor
's
rapid
recovery
since
the
warmer
weather
had
set
in
,
and
praising
Mr
Hoggins
's
skill
,
and
lamenting
his
want
of
refinement
and
manner
<EOS>
(
it
seems
a
curious
coincidence
that
this
should
have
been
our
subject
,
but
so
it
was
)
,
when
a
knock
was
heard
 
a
caller
's
knock
 
three
distinct
taps
 
<EOS>
and
we
were
flying
<EOS>
(
that
is
to
say
,
Miss
Matty
could
not
walk
very
fast
,
having
had
a
touch
of
rheumatism
)
to
our
rooms
,
to
change
cap
and
collars
,
when
Miss
Pole
arrested
us
by
calling
out
,
as
she
came
up
the
stairs
,
"
Do
n't
go
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
wait
 
<EOS>
it
is
not
twelve
,
I
know
 
<EOS>
but
never
mind
your
dress
 
<EOS>
I
must
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
We
did
our
best
to
look
as
if
it
was
not
we
who
had
made
the
hurried
movement
,
the
sound
of
which
she
had
heard
;
for
,
of
course
,
we
did
not
like
to
have
it
supposed
that
we
had
any
old
clothes
that
it
was
convenient
to
wear
out
in
the
"
sanctuary
of
home
,
"
as
Miss
Jenkyns
once
prettily
called
the
back
parlour
,
where
she
was
tying
up
preserves
.
 
<EOS>
So
we
threw
our
gentility
with
double
force
into
our
manners
,
and
very
genteel
we
were
for
two
minutes
while
Miss
Pole
recovered
breath
,
and
excited
our
curiosity
strongly
by
lifting
up
her
hands
in
amazement
,
and
bringing
them
down
in
silence
,
as
if
what
she
had
to
say
was
too
big
for
words
,
and
could
only
be
expressed
by
pantomime
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
,
Miss
Matty
?
 
<EOS>
What
DO
you
think
?
 
<EOS>
Lady
Glenmire
is
to
marry
 
<EOS>
is
to
be
married
<EOS>
,
I
mean
 
Lady
Glenmire
 
<EOS>
Mr
Hoggins
 
<EOS>
Mr
Hoggins
is
going
to
marry
Lady
Glenmire
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Marry
!
"
said
we
.
 
<EOS>
"
Marry
!
 
<EOS>
Madness
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Marry
!
"
said
Miss
Pole
,
with
the
decision
that
belonged
to
her
character
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
said
marry
!
<EOS>
as
you
do
;
and
I
also
said
,
"
What
a
fool
my
lady
is
going
to
make
of
herself
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
said
"
Madness
!
"
<EOS>
but
I
controlled
myself
,
for
it
was
in
a
public
shop
that
I
heard
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Where
feminine
delicacy
is
gone
to
,
I
do
n't
know
!
 
<EOS>
You
and
I
,
Miss
Matty
,
would
have
been
ashamed
to
have
known
that
our
marriage
was
spoken
of
in
a
grocer
's
shop
,
in
the
hearing
of
shopmen
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
said
Miss
Matty
,
sighing
as
one
recovering
from
a
blow
,
"
perhaps
it
is
not
true
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
we
are
doing
her
injustice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Miss
Pole
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
taken
care
to
ascertain
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
straight
to
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
,
to
borrow
a
cookery
-
book
which
I
knew
she
had
;
and
I
introduced
my
congratulations
a
propos
of
the
difficulty
gentlemen
must
have
in
house
-
keeping
;
and
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
bridled
up
,
and
said
that
she
believed
it
was
true
,
though
how
and
where
I
could
have
heard
it
<EOS>
she
did
not
know
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
her
brother
and
Lady
Glenmire
had
come
to
an
understanding
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Understanding
!
"
<EOS>
such
a
coarse
word
!
 
<EOS>
But
my
lady
will
have
to
come
down
to
many
a
want
of
refinement
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
believe
Mr
Hoggins
sups
on
bread
-
and
-
cheese
and
beer
every
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
Marry
!
<EOS>
"
said
Miss
Matty
once
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
I
never
thought
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Two
people
that
we
know
going
to
be
married
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
coming
very
near
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
So
near
that
my
heart
stopped
beating
when
I
heard
of
it
,
while
you
might
have
counted
twelve
,
"
said
Miss
Pole
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
does
not
know
whose
turn
may
come
next
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
in
Cranford
,
poor
Lady
Glenmire
might
have
thought
herself
safe
,
"
said
Miss
Matty
,
with
a
gentle
pity
in
her
tones
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
"
said
Miss
Pole
,
with
a
toss
of
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
remember
poor
dear
Captain
Brown
's
song
"
Tibbie
Fowler
,
"
and
the
line
     
<EOS>
"
Set
her
on
the
Tintock
tap
,
The
wind
will
blaw
a
man
till
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
because
"
Tibbie
Fowler
"
was
rich
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
there
was
a
kind
of
attraction
about
Lady
Glenmire
that
I
,
for
one
,
should
be
ashamed
to
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
put
in
my
wonder
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
how
can
she
have
fancied
Mr
Hoggins
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
surprised
that
Mr
Hoggins
has
liked
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Hoggins
is
rich
,
and
very
pleasant-
looking
,
"
said
Miss
Matty
,
"
and
very
good
-
tempered
and
kind-
hearted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
married
for
an
establishment
,
that
's
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
takes
the
surgery
with
it
,
"
said
Miss
Pole
,
with
a
little
dry
laugh
at
her
own
joke
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
like
many
people
who
think
they
have
made
a
severe
and
sarcastic
speech
,
which
yet
is
clever
of
its
kind
,
she
began
to
relax
in
her
grimness
from
the
moment
when
she
made
this
allusion
to
the
surgery
;
and
we
turned
to
speculate
on
the
way
in
which
Mrs
Jamieson
would
receive
the
news
.
 
<EOS>
The
person
whom
she
had
left
in
charge
of
her
house
to
keep
off
followers
from
her
maids
to
set
up
a
follower
of
her
own
!
 
<EOS>
And
that
follower
a
man
whom
Mrs
Jamieson
had
tabooed
as
vulgar
,
and
inadmissible
to
Cranford
society
,
not
merely
on
account
of
his
name
,
<EOS>
but
because
of
his
voice
,
his
complexion
,
his
boots
,
smelling
of
the
stable
,
and
himself
,
smelling
of
drugs
.
 
<EOS>
Had
he
ever
been
to
see
Lady
Glenmire
at
Mrs
Jamieson
's
?
 
<EOS>
Chloride
of
lime
would
not
purify
the
house
in
its
owner
's
estimation
if
he
had
.
 
<EOS>
Or
had
their
interviews
been
confined
to
the
occasional
meetings
in
the
chamber
of
the
poor
sick
conjuror
,
to
whom
,
with
all
our
sense
of
the
mesalliance
,
we
could
not
help
allowing
that
they
had
both
been
exceedingly
kind
?
 
<EOS>
And
now
it
turned
out
that
a
servant
of
Mrs
Jamieson
's
had
been
ill
,
and
Mr
Hoggins
had
been
attending
her
for
some
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
wolf
had
got
into
the
fold
,
and
now
he
was
carrying
off
the
shepherdess
.
<EOS>
What
would
Mrs
Jamieson
say
?
 
<EOS>
We
looked
into
the
darkness
of
futurity
as
a
child
gazes
after
a
rocket
up
in
the
cloudy
sky
,
full
of
wondering
expectation
of
the
rattle
,
the
discharge
,
and
the
brilliant
shower
of
sparks
and
light
.
 
<EOS>
Then
we
brought
ourselves
down
to
earth
and
<EOS>
the
present
time
by
questioning
each
other
(
being
all
equally
ignorant
,
and
all
equally
without
the
slightest
data
to
build
any
conclusions
upon
)
<EOS>
as
to
when
IT
would
take
place
?
 
<EOS>
Where
?
<EOS>
How
much
a
year
Mr
Hoggins
had
?
 
<EOS>
Whether
she
would
drop
her
title
?
<EOS>
And
how
Martha
and
the
other
correct
servants
in
Cranford
would
ever
be
brought
to
announce
a
married
couple
as
Lady
Glenmire
and
Mr
Hoggins
?
 
<EOS>
But
would
they
be
visited
?
 
<EOS>
Would
Mrs
Jamieson
let
us
?
<EOS>
Or
must
we
choose
between
the
Honourable
Mrs
Jamieson
and
the
degraded
Lady
Glenmire
?
 
<EOS>
We
all
liked
Lady
Glenmire
the
best
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
bright
,
and
kind
,
and
sociable
,
and
agreeable
;
and
Mrs
Jamieson
was
dull
,
and
inert
,
and
pompous
,
and
tiresome
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
had
acknowledged
the
sway
of
the
latter
so
long
,
that
it
seemed
like
a
kind
of
disloyalty
now
even
to
meditate
disobedience
to
the
prohibition
we
anticipated
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
surprised
us
in
our
darned
caps
and
patched
collars
;
and
we
forgot
all
about
them
in
our
eagerness
to
see
how
she
would
bear
the
information
,
which
we
honourably
left
to
Miss
Pole
,
to
impart
,
although
,
if
we
had
been
inclined
to
take
unfair
advantage
,
we
might
have
rushed
in
ourselves
,
for
she
had
a
most
out
-
of
-
place
fit
of
coughing
for
five
minutes
after
Mrs
Forrester
entered
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
the
imploring
expression
of
her
eyes
,
as
she
looked
at
us
over
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
They
said
,
as
plain
as
words
could
speak
,
"
Do
n't
let
Nature
deprive
me
of
the
treasure
which
is
mine
,
although
for
a
time
I
can
make
no
use
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
we
did
not
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
's
surprise
was
equal
to
ours
;
and
her
sense
of
injury
rather
greater
,
because
she
had
to
feel
for
her
Order
,
and
saw
more
fully
than
we
could
do
how
such
conduct
brought
stains
on
the
aristocracy
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
and
Miss
Pole
left
us
we
endeavoured
to
subside
into
calmness
;
but
Miss
Matty
was
really
upset
by
the
intelligence
she
had
heard
.
 
<EOS>
She
reckoned
it
up
,
and
it
was
more
than
fifteen
years
since
she
had
heard
of
any
of
her
acquaintance
going
to
be
married
,
with
the
one
exception
of
Miss
Jessie
Brown
;
and
,
as
she
said
,
it
gave
her
quite
a
shock
,
and
made
her
feel
as
if
she
could
not
think
what
would
happen
next
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
it
is
a
fancy
of
mine
,
or
a
real
fact
,
but
I
have
noticed
that
,
just
after
the
announcement
of
an
engagement
in
any
set
,
the
unmarried
ladies
in
that
set
flutter
out
in
an
unusual
gaiety
and
newness
of
dress
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
in
a
tacit
and
unconscious
manner
,
"
We
also
are
spinsters
.
"
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
and
Miss
Pole
talked
and
thought
more
about
bonnets
,
gowns
,
caps
,
and
shawls
,
during
the
fortnight
that
succeeded
this
call
,
than
I
had
known
them
do
for
years
before
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
might
be
the
spring
weather
,
for
it
was
a
warm
and
pleasant
March
;
and
merinoes
and
beavers
,
and
woollen
materials
of
all
sorts
were
but
ungracious
receptacles
of
the
bright
sun
's
glancing
rays
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
not
been
Lady
Glenmire
's
dress
that
had
won
Mr
Hoggins
's
heart
,
for
she
went
about
on
her
errands
of
kindness
more
shabby
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
Although
in
the
hurried
glimpses
I
caught
of
her
at
church
or
elsewhere
she
appeared
rather
to
shun
meeting
any
of
her
friends
<EOS>
,
her
face
seemed
to
have
almost
something
of
the
flush
of
youth
in
it
;
her
lips
looked
redder
and
more
trembling
full
than
in
their
old
compressed
state
,
and
her
eyes
dwelt
on
all
things
with
a
lingering
light
,
as
if
she
was
learning
to
love
Cranford
and
its
belongings
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Hoggins
looked
broad
and
radiant
,
and
creaked
up
the
middle
aisle
at
church
in
a
brand
-
new
pair
of
top
-
boots
 
<EOS>
an
audible
,
as
well
as
visible
,
sign
of
his
purposed
change
of
state
;
for
the
tradition
went
,
that
the
boots
he
had
worn
till
now
were
the
identical
pair
in
which
he
first
set
out
on
his
rounds
in
Cranford
twenty
-
five
years
ago
;
only
they
had
been
new
-
pieced
,
high
and
low
,
top
and
bottom
,
heel
and
sole
,
black
leather
and
brown
leather
,
more
times
than
any
one
could
tell
.
  
<EOS>
None
of
the
ladies
in
Cranford
chose
to
sanction
the
marriage
by
congratulating
either
of
the
parties
.
 
<EOS>
We
wished
to
ignore
the
whole
affair
until
our
liege
lady
,
Mrs
Jamieson
,
returned
.
 
<EOS>
Till
she
came
back
to
give
us
our
cue
,
we
felt
that
it
would
be
better
to
consider
the
engagement
in
the
same
light
as
the
Queen
of
Spain
's
legs
 
facts
which
certainly
existed
,
but
the
less
said
about
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
This
restraint
upon
our
tongues
 
for
<EOS>
you
see
if
we
did
not
speak
about
it
to
any
of
the
parties
concerned
,
how
could
we
get
answers
to
the
questions
that
we
longed
to
ask
?
 
<EOS>
was
beginning
to
be
irksome
,
and
our
idea
of
the
dignity
of
silence
was
paling
before
our
curiosity
,
when
another
direction
was
given
to
our
thoughts
,
by
an
announcement
on
the
part
of
the
principal
shopkeeper
of
Cranford
,
who
ranged
the
trades
from
grocer
and
cheesemonger
to
man
-
milliner
,
as
occasion
required
,
that
the
spring
fashions
were
arrived
,
and
would
be
exhibited
on
the
following
Tuesday
at
his
rooms
in
High
Street
.
 
<EOS>
Now
Miss
Matty
had
been
only
waiting
for
this
before
buying
herself
a
new
silk
gown
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
offered
,
it
is
true
,
to
send
to
Drumble
for
patterns
,
but
she
had
rejected
my
proposal
,
gently
implying
that
she
had
not
forgotten
her
disappointment
about
the
sea
-
green
turban
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
thankful
that
I
was
on
the
spot
now
,
to
counteract
the
dazzling
fascination
of
any
yellow
or
scarlet
silk
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
say
a
word
or
two
here
about
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
spoken
of
my
father
's
old
friendship
for
the
Jenkyns
family
;
indeed
,
I
am
not
sure
if
there
was
not
some
distant
relationship
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
willingly
allowed
me
to
remain
all
the
winter
at
Cranford
,
in
consideration
of
a
letter
which
Miss
Matty
had
written
to
him
about
the
time
of
the
panic
,
in
which
I
suspect
she
had
exaggerated
my
powers
and
my
bravery
as
a
defender
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
that
the
days
were
longer
and
more
cheerful
,
he
was
beginning
to
urge
the
necessity
of
my
return
;
and
I
only
delayed
in
a
sort
of
odd
forlorn
hope
that
if
I
could
obtain
any
clear
information
,
I
might
make
the
account
given
by
the
signora
of
the
Aga
Jenkyns
tally
with
that
of
"
poor
Peter
,
"
his
appearance
and
disappearance
,
which
I
had
winnowed
out
of
the
conversation
of
Miss
Pole
and
Mrs
Forrester
.

STOPPED
PAYMENT
 
<EOS>
The
very
Tuesday
morning
on
which
Mr
Johnson
was
going
to
show
the
fashions
,
the
post
-
woman
brought
two
letters
to
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
the
post
-
woman
,
but
I
should
say
the
postman
's
wife
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
lame
shoemaker
,
a
very
clean
,
honest
man
,
much
respected
in
the
town
;
but
he
never
brought
the
letters
round
except
on
unusual
occasions
,
such
as
Christmas
Day
or
Good
Friday
;
and
on
those
days
the
letters
,
which
should
have
been
delivered
at
eight
in
the
morning
,
did
not
make
their
appearance
until
two
or
three
in
the
afternoon
,
for
every
one
liked
poor
Thomas
,
and
gave
him
a
welcome
on
these
festive
occasions
.
 
<EOS>
He
used
to
say
,
"
He
was
welly
stawed
wi
'
eating
,
for
there
were
three
or
four
houses
where
nowt
would
serve
'em
<EOS>
but
he
must
share
in
their
breakfast
;
"
and
by
the
time
he
had
done
his
last
breakfast
,
he
came
to
some
other
friend
who
was
beginning
dinner
;
but
come
what
might
in
the
way
of
temptation
<EOS>
,
Tom
was
always
sober
,
civil
,
and
smiling
;
and
,
as
Miss
Jenkyns
used
to
say
,
it
was
a
lesson
in
patience
,
that
she
doubted
not
would
call
out
that
precious
quality
in
some
minds
,
where
,
but
for
Thomas
,
it
might
have
lain
dormant
and
undiscovered
.
 
<EOS>
Patience
was
certainly
very
dormant
in
Miss
Jenkyns
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
always
expecting
letters
,
and
always
drumming
on
the
table
till
the
post
-
woman
had
called
or
gone
past
.
 
<EOS>
On
Christmas
Day
and
<EOS>
Good
Friday
she
drummed
from
breakfast
till
church
,
from
church
-
time
till
two
o'clock
 
unless
when
the
fire
wanted
stirring
,
when
she
invariably
knocked
down
the
fire
-
irons
,
and
scolded
Miss
Matty
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
equally
certain
was
the
hearty
welcome
and
the
good
dinner
for
Thomas
;
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
standing
over
him
like
a
bold
dragoon
,
questioning
him
as
to
his
children
 
what
they
were
doing
 
<EOS>
what
school
they
went
to
;
upbraiding
him
if
another
was
likely
to
make
its
appearance
,
but
sending
even
the
little
babies
the
shilling
and
the
mince
-
pie
which
was
her
gift
to
all
the
children
,
with
half
-
a
-
crown
in
addition
for
both
father
and
mother
.
 
<EOS>
The
post
was
not
half
of
so
much
consequence
to
dear
Miss
Matty
;
but
not
for
the
world
would
she
have
diminished
Thomas
's
welcome
and
his
dole
,
though
I
could
see
that
she
felt
rather
shy
over
the
ceremony
,
which
had
been
regarded
by
Miss
Jenkyns
as
a
glorious
opportunity
for
giving
advice
and
benefiting
her
fellow
-
creatures
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
would
steal
the
money
all
in
a
lump
into
his
hand
,
as
if
she
were
ashamed
of
herself
.
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
gave
him
each
individual
coin
separate
,
with
a
"
There
!
<EOS>
that
's
for
yourself
;
that
's
for
Jenny
,
"
etc
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
would
even
beckon
Martha
out
of
the
kitchen
while
he
ate
his
food
:
 
and
once
,
to
my
knowledge
,
winked
at
its
rapid
disappearance
into
a
blue
cotton
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Jenkyns
almost
scolded
him
if
he
did
not
leave
a
clean
plate
,
however
heaped
it
might
have
been
,
and
gave
an
injunction
with
every
mouthful
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
wandered
a
long
way
from
the
two
letters
that
awaited
us
on
the
breakfast
-
table
that
Tuesday
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Mine
was
from
my
father
.
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
's
was
printed
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
's
was
just
a
man
's
letter
;
I
mean
it
was
very
dull
,
and
gave
no
information
beyond
that
he
was
well
,
that
they
had
had
a
good
deal
of
rain
,
that
trade
was
very
stagnant
,
and
there
were
many
disagreeable
rumours
afloat
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
asked
me
if
I
knew
whether
Miss
Matty
still
retained
her
shares
in
the
Town
and
County
Bank
,
as
there
were
very
unpleasant
reports
about
it
;
though
nothing
more
than
he
had
always
foreseen
,
and
had
prophesied
to
Miss
Jenkyns
years
ago
,
when
she
would
invest
their
little
property
in
it
 
the
only
unwise
step
that
clever
woman
had
ever
taken
,
to
his
knowledge
(
the
only
time
she
ever
acted
against
his
advice
,
I
knew
)
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
if
anything
had
gone
wrong
,
of
course
I
was
not
to
think
of
leaving
Miss
Matty
while
I
could
be
of
any
use
,
etc
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
your
letter
from
,
my
dear
?
 
<EOS>
Mine
is
a
very
civil
invitation
,
signed
"
Edwin
Wilson
,
"
asking
me
to
attend
an
important
meeting
of
the
shareholders
of
the
Town
and
County
Bank
,
to
be
held
in
Drumble
,
on
Thursday
the
twenty
-
first
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
<EOS>
,
it
is
very
attentive
of
them
to
remember
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
did
not
like
to
hear
of
this
"
important
meeting
,
"
for
,
though
I
did
not
know
much
about
business
,
I
feared
it
confirmed
what
my
father
said
:
 
<EOS>
however
,
I
thought
,
ill
news
always
came
fast
enough
,
so
I
resolved
to
say
nothing
about
my
alarm
,
and
merely
told
her
that
my
father
was
well
,
and
sent
his
kind
regards
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
kept
turning
over
and
admiring
her
letter
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
she
spoke
     
<EOS>
"
I
remember
their
sending
one
to
Deborah
just
like
this
;
but
that
I
did
not
wonder
at
,
for
everybody
knew
she
was
so
clear
-
headed
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
I
could
not
help
them
much
;
indeed
,
if
they
came
to
accounts
,
I
should
be
quite
in
the
way
,
for
I
never
could
do
sums
in
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
Deborah
,
I
know
,
rather
wished
to
go
,
and
went
so
far
as
to
order
a
new
bonnet
for
the
occasion
:
 
but
when
the
time
came
she
had
a
bad
cold
;
so
they
sent
her
a
very
polite
account
of
what
they
had
done
.
 
<EOS>
Chosen
a
director
,
I
think
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
think
they
want
me
to
help
them
to
choose
a
director
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
should
choose
your
father
at
once
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
has
no
shares
in
the
bank
,
"
said
I.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
I
remember
.
 
<EOS>
He
objected
very
much
to
Deborah
's
buying
any
,
I
believe
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
was
quite
the
woman
of
business
,
and
always
judged
for
herself
;
and
here
,
you
see
,
they
have
paid
eight
per
cent
.
<EOS>
all
these
years
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
uncomfortable
subject
to
me
,
with
my
half
-
knowledge
;
so
I
thought
I
would
change
the
conversation
,
and
I
asked
at
what
time
she
thought
we
had
better
go
and
see
the
fashions
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
"
she
said
,
"
the
thing
is
this
:
 
it
is
not
etiquette
to
go
till
after
twelve
;
but
then
,
you
see
,
all
Cranford
will
be
there
,
and
one
does
not
like
to
be
too
curious
about
dress
and
trimmings
and
caps
with
all
the
world
looking
on
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
never
genteel
to
be
over
-
curious
on
these
occasions
.
 
<EOS>
Deborah
had
the
knack
of
always
looking
as
if
the
latest
fashion
was
nothing
new
to
her
;
a
manner
she
had
caught
from
Lady
Arley
,
who
did
see
all
the
new
modes
in
London
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
thought
we
would
just
slip
down
 
for
I
do
want
this
morning
,
soon
after
breakfast
half
-
a
-
pound
of
tea
 
<EOS>
and
then
we
could
go
up
and
examine
the
things
at
our
leisure
,
and
see
exactly
how
my
new
silk
gown
must
be
made
;
and
then
,
after
twelve
,
we
could
go
with
our
minds
disengaged
,
and
free
from
thoughts
of
dress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
began
to
talk
of
Miss
Matty
's
new
silk
gown
.
 
<EOS>
I
discovered
that
it
would
be
really
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
she
had
had
to
choose
anything
of
consequence
for
herself
:
 
for
Miss
Jenkyns
had
always
been
the
more
decided
character
,
whatever
her
taste
might
have
been
;
and
it
is
astonishing
how
such
people
carry
the
world
before
them
by
the
mere
force
of
will
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
anticipated
the
sight
of
the
glossy
folds
with
as
much
delight
as
if
the
five
sovereigns
,
set
apart
for
the
purchase
,
could
buy
all
the
silks
in
the
shop
;
and
(
remembering
my
own
loss
of
two
hours
in
a
toyshop
before
I
could
tell
on
what
wonder
to
spend
a
silver
threepence
)
<EOS>
I
was
very
glad
that
we
were
going
early
,
that
dear
Miss
Matty
might
have
leisure
for
the
delights
of
perplexity
.
  
<EOS>
If
a
happy
sea
-
green
could
be
met
with
,
the
gown
was
to
be
sea
-
green
:
if
not
,
she
inclined
to
maize
,
and
I
to
silver
gray
;
and
we
discussed
the
requisite
number
of
breadths
until
we
arrived
at
the
shop
-
door
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
to
buy
the
tea
,
select
the
silk
,
and
then
clamber
up
the
iron
corkscrew
stairs
that
led
into
what
was
once
a
loft
,
though
now
a
fashion
show
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
young
men
at
Mr
Johnson
's
had
on
their
best
looks
;
and
their
best
cravats
,
and
pivoted
themselves
over
the
counter
with
surprising
activity
.
 
<EOS>
They
wanted
to
show
us
upstairs
at
once
;
but
on
the
principle
of
business
first
and
pleasure
afterwards
,
we
stayed
to
purchase
the
tea
.
 
<EOS>
Here
Miss
Matty
's
absence
of
mind
betrayed
itself
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
was
made
aware
that
she
had
been
drinking
green
tea
at
any
time
,
she
always
thought
it
her
duty
to
lie
awake
half
through
the
night
afterward
(
I
have
known
her
take
it
in
ignorance
many
a
time
without
such
effects
)
,
and
consequently
green
tea
was
prohibited
the
house
;
yet
to
-
day
<EOS>
she
herself
asked
for
the
obnoxious
article
,
under
the
impression
that
she
was
talking
about
the
silk
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
the
mistake
was
soon
rectified
;
and
then
the
silks
were
unrolled
in
good
truth
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
shop
was
pretty
well
filled
,
for
it
was
Cranford
market
-
day
,
and
many
of
the
farmers
and
country
people
from
the
neighbourhood
round
came
in
,
sleeking
down
their
hair
,
and
glancing
shyly
about
,
from
under
their
eyelids
,
as
anxious
to
take
back
some
notion
of
the
unusual
gaiety
to
the
mistress
or
the
lasses
at
home
,
and
yet
feeling
that
they
were
out
of
place
among
the
smart
shopmen
and
gay
shawls
and
summer
prints
.
 
<EOS>
One
honest
-
looking
man
,
however
,
made
his
way
up
to
the
counter
at
which
we
stood
,
and
boldly
asked
to
look
at
a
shawl
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
country
folk
confined
themselves
to
the
grocery
side
;
but
our
neighbour
was
evidently
too
full
of
some
kind
intention
towards
mistress
,
wife
or
daughter
,
to
be
shy
;
and
it
soon
became
a
question
with
me
,
whether
he
or
Miss
Matty
would
keep
their
shopmen
the
longest
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
each
shawl
more
beautiful
than
the
last
;
and
,
as
for
Miss
Matty
,
she
smiled
and
sighed
over
each
fresh
bale
that
was
brought
out
;
one
colour
set
off
another
,
and
the
heap
together
would
,
as
she
said
,
make
even
the
rainbow
look
poor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
"
said
she
,
hesitating
,
"
<EOS>
Whichever
I
choose
I
shall
wish
I
had
taken
another
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
this
lovely
crimson
!
<EOS>
it
would
be
so
warm
in
winter
.
 
<EOS>
But
spring
is
coming
on
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
have
a
gown
for
every
season
,
"
said
she
,
dropping
her
voice
 
as
we
all
did
in
Cranford
whenever
we
talked
of
anything
we
wished
for
but
could
not
afford
.
 
<EOS>
"
However
,
"
she
continued
in
a
louder
and
more
cheerful
tone
,
"
it
would
give
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
take
care
of
them
if
I
had
them
;
so
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
I
'll
only
take
one
.
<EOS>
But
which
must
it
be
,
my
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
And
now
she
hovered
over
a
lilac
with
yellow
spots
,
while
I
pulled
out
a
quiet
sage
-
green
that
had
faded
into
insignificance
under
the
more
brilliant
colours
,
but
which
was
nevertheless
a
good
silk
in
its
humble
way
.
 
<EOS>
Our
attention
was
called
off
to
our
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
chosen
a
shawl
of
about
thirty
shillings
'
value
;
and
his
face
looked
broadly
happy
,
under
the
anticipation
,
no
doubt
,
of
the
pleasant
surprise
he
would
give
to
some
Molly
or
Jenny
at
home
;
he
had
tugged
a
leathern
purse
out
of
his
breeches
-
pocket
,
and
had
offered
a
five
-
pound
note
in
payment
for
the
shawl
,
and
for
some
parcels
which
had
been
brought
round
to
him
from
the
grocery
counter
;
and
it
was
just
at
this
point
that
he
attracted
our
notice
.
 
<EOS>
The
shopman
was
examining
the
note
with
a
puzzled
,
doubtful
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
Town
and
County
Bank
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
sure
,
sir
,
but
I
believe
we
have
received
a
warning
against
notes
issued
by
this
bank
only
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
just
step
and
ask
Mr
Johnson
,
sir
;
but
I
'm
afraid
I
must
trouble
you
for
payment
in
cash
,
or
in
a
note
of
a
different
bank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
never
saw
a
man
's
countenance
fall
so
suddenly
into
dismay
and
bewilderment
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
almost
piteous
to
see
the
rapid
change
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dang
it
!
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
striking
his
fist
down
on
the
table
,
as
if
to
try
which
was
the
harder
<EOS>
,
"
the
chap
talks
as
if
notes
and
gold

be
had

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
had
forgotten
her
silk
gown
in
her
interest
for
the
man
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
she
had
caught
the
name
of
the
bank
,
and
in
my
nervous
cowardice
I
was
anxious
that
she
should
not
;
and
so
I
began
admiring
the
yellow
-
spotted
lilac
<EOS>
gown
that
I
had
been
utterly
condemning
only
a
minute
before
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
of
no
use
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
bank
was
it
?
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
what
bank
did
your
note
belong
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Town
and
County
Bank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
it
,
"
said
she
quietly
to
the
shopman
,
gently
taking
it
out
of
his
hand
,
as
he
brought
it
back
to
return
it
to
the
farmer
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Johnson
was
very
sorry
,
but
,
from
information
he
had
received
,
the
notes
issued
by
that
bank
were
little
better
than
waste
paper
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
it
,
"
said
Miss
Matty
to
me
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
our
bank
,
is
it
not
?
 
<EOS>
the
Town
and
County
Bank
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
I.
 
<EOS>
"
This
lilac
silk
will
just
match
the
ribbons
in
your
new
cap
,
I
believe
,
"
I
continued
,
holding
up
the
folds
so
as
to
catch
the
light
,
and
wishing
that
the
man
would
make
haste
and
be
gone
,
and
yet
having
a
new
wonder
,
that
had
only
just
sprung
up
,
how
far
it
was
wise
or
right
in
me
to
allow
Miss
Matty
to
make
this
expensive
purchase
,
if
the
affairs
of
the
bank
were
really
so
bad
as
the
refusal
of
the
note
implied
.
  
<EOS>
But
Miss
Matty
put
on
the
soft
dignified
manner
,
peculiar
to
her
,
rarely
used
,
and
yet
<EOS>
which
became
her
so
well
,
and
laying
her
hand
gently
on
mine
,
she
said
     
"
Never
mind
the
silks
for
a
few
minutes
,
dear
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
sir
,
"
turning
now
to
the
shopman
,
who
had
been
attending
to
the
farmer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
this
a
forged
note
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
ma'am
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
true
note
of
its
kind
;
but
you
see
,
ma'am
,
it
is
a
joint
-
stock
bank
,
and
there
are
reports
out
that
it
is
likely
to
break
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Johnson
is
only
doing
his
duty
,
ma'am
,
as
I
am
sure
Mr
Dobson
knows
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
Mr
Dobson
could
not
respond
to
the
appealing
bow
by
any
answering
smile
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
turning
the
note
absently
over
in
his
fingers
,
looking
gloomily
enough
at
the
parcel
containing
the
lately
-
chosen
shawl
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
hard
upon
a
poor
man
,
"
said
he
,
"
as
earns
every
farthing
with
the
sweat
of
his
brow
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
there
's
no
help
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
take
back
your
shawl
,
my
man
;
Lizzle
must
go
on
with
her
cloak
for
a
while
.
 
<EOS>
And
yon
figs
for
the
little
ones
 
<EOS>
I
promised
them
to
'em
 
<EOS>
I
'll
take
them
;
but
the
"
bacco
,
and
the
other
things
"
     
<EOS>
"
I
will
give
you
five
sovereigns
for
your
note
,
my
good
man
,
"
said
Miss
Matty
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
there
is
some
great
mistake
about
it
,
for
I
am
one
of
the
shareholders
,
and
I
'm
sure
they
would
have
told
me
if
things
had
not
been
going
on
right
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
shopman
whispered
a
word
or
two
across
the
table
to
Miss
Matty
.
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
with
a
dubious
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
so
,
"
said
she
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
pretend
to
understand
business
;
I
only
know
that
if
it
is
going
to
fail
,
and
if
honest
people
are
to
lose
their
money
because
they
have
taken
our
notes
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
explain
myself
,
"
said
she
,
suddenly
becoming
aware
that
she
had
got
into
a
long
sentence
with
four
people
for
audience
;
"
only
I
would
rather
exchange
my
gold
for
the
note
,
if
you
please
,
"
turning
to
the
farmer
,
"
and
then
you
can
take
your
wife
the
shawl
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
only
going
without
my
gown
a
few
days
longer
,
"
she
continued
,
speaking
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
everything
will
be
cleared
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
it
is
cleared
up
the
wrong
way
?
"
said
I.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
it
will
only
have
been
common
honesty
in
me
,
as
a
shareholder
,
to
have
given
this
good
man
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
quite
clear
about
it
in
my
own
mind
;
but
,
you
know
,
I
can
never
speak
quite
as
comprehensibly
as
others
can
,
only
you
must
give
me
your
note
,
Mr
Dobson
,
if
you
please
,
and
go
on
with
your
purchases
with
these
sovereigns
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
looked
at
her
with
silent
gratitude
 
too
awkward
to
put
his
thanks
into
words
;
but
he
hung
back
for
a
minute
or
two
,
fumbling
with
his
note
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
loth
to
make
another
one
lose
instead
of
me
,
if
it
is
a
loss
;
but
,
you
see
,
five
pounds
is
a
deal
of
money
to
a
man
with
a
family
;
and
,
as
you
say
,
ten
to
one
in
a
day
or
two
the
note
will
be
as
good
as
gold
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
hope
of
that
,
my
friend
,
"
said
the
shopman
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
more
reason
why
I
should
take
it
,
"
said
Miss
Matty
quietly
.
<EOS>
She
pushed
her
sovereigns
towards
the
man
,
who
slowly
laid
his
note
down
in
exchange
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
wait
a
day
or
two
before
I
purchase
any
of
these
silks
;
perhaps
you
will
then
have
a
greater
choice
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
,
will
you
come
upstairs
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
inspected
the
fashions
with
as
minute
and
curious
an
interest
as
if
the
gown
to
be
made
after
them
had
been
bought
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
that
the
little
event
in
the
shop
below
had
in
the
least
damped
Miss
Matty
's
curiosity
as
to
the
make
of
sleeves
or
the
sit
of
skirts
.
 
<EOS>
She
once
or
twice
exchanged
congratulations
with
me
on
our
private
and
leisurely
view
of
the
bonnets
and
shawls
;
but
I
was
,
all
the
time
,
not
so
sure
that
our
examination
was
so
utterly
private
,
for
I
caught
glimpses
of
a
figure
dodging
behind
the
cloaks
and
mantles
;
and
,
by
a
dexterous
move
,
I
came
face
to
face
with
Miss
Pole
,
also
in
morning
costume
(
<EOS>
the
principal
feature
of
which
was
her
being
without
teeth
,
and
wearing
a
veil
to
conceal
the
deficiency
)
,
come
on
the
same
errand
as
ourselves
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
quickly
took
her
departure
,
because
,
as
she
said
,
she
had
a
bad
headache
,
and
did
not
feel
herself
up
to
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
As
we
came
down
through
the
shop
,
the
civil
Mr
Johnson
was
awaiting
us
;
he
had
been
informed
of
the
exchange
of
the
note
for
gold
,
and
with
much
good
feeling
and
real
kindness
,
but
with
a
little
want
of
tact
,
he
wished
to
condole
with
Miss
Matty
,
and
impress
upon
her
the
true
state
of
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
only
hope
that
he
had
heard
an
exaggerated
rumour
for
<EOS>
he
said
that
her
shares
were
worse
than
nothing
,
and
that
the
bank
could
not
pay
a
shilling
in
the
pound
.
<EOS>
I
was
glad
that
Miss
Matty
seemed
still
a
little
incredulous
;
but
I
could
not
tell
how
much
of
this
was
real
or
assumed
,
with
that
self
-
control
which
seemed
habitual
to
ladies
of
Miss
Matty
's
standing
in
Cranford
,
who
would
have
thought
their
dignity
compromised
by
the
slightest
expression
of
surprise
,
dismay
,
or
any
similar
feeling
to
an
inferior
in
station
,
or
in
a
public
shop
.
<EOS>
However
,
we
walked
home
very
silently
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
ashamed
to
say
,
I
believe
I
was
rather
vexed
and
annoyed
at
Miss
Matty
's
conduct
in
taking
the
note
to
herself
so
decidedly
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
so
set
my
heart
upon
her
having
a
new
silk
gown
,
which
she
wanted
sadly
;
in
general
she
was
so
undecided
anybody
might
turn
her
round
;
in
this
case
I
had
felt
that
it
was
no
use
attempting
it
,
but
I
was
not
the
less
put
out
at
the
result
.
  
<EOS>
Somehow
,
after
twelve
o'clock
,
we
both
acknowledged
to
a
sated
curiosity
about
the
fashions
,
and
to
a
certain
fatigue
of
body
(
which
was
,
in
fact
,
depression
of
mind
)
<EOS>
that
indisposed
us
to
go
out
again
.
 
<EOS>
But
still
we
never
spoke
of
the
note
;
till
,
all
at
once
,
something
possessed
me
to
ask
Miss
Matty
if
she
would
think
it
her
duty
to
offer
sovereigns
for
all
the
notes
of
the
Town
and
County
Bank
<EOS>
she
met
with
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
have
bitten
my
tongue
out
the
minute
I
had
said
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
up
rather
sadly
,
and
as
if
I
had
thrown
a
new
perplexity
into
her
already
distressed
mind
;
and
for
a
minute
or
two
she
did
not
speak
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
said
 
<EOS>
my
own
dear
Miss
Matty
 
<EOS>
without
a
shade
of
reproach
in
her
voice
     
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
I
never
feel
as
if
my
mind
was
what
people
call
very
strong
;
and
it
's
often
hard
enough
work
for
me
to
settle
what
I
ought
to
do
with
the
case
right
before
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
very
thankful
to
 
<EOS>
I
was
very
thankful
,
that
I
saw
my
duty
this
morning
,
with
the
poor
man
standing
by
me
;
but
its
rather
a
strain
upon
me
to
keep
thinking
and
thinking
what
I
should
do
if
such
and
such
a
thing
happened
;
and
,
<EOS>
I
believe
,
I
had
rather
wait
and
see
what
really
does
come
;
and
I
do
n't
doubt
I
shall
be
helped
then
if
I
do
n't
fidget
myself
,
and
get
too
anxious
beforehand
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
,
love
,
I
'm
not
like
Deborah
.
 
<EOS>
If
Deborah
had
lived
,
I
've
no
doubt
she
would
have
seen
after
them
,
before
they
had
got
themselves
into
this
state
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
had
neither
of
us
much
appetite
for
dinner
,
though
we
tried
to
talk
cheerfully
about
indifferent
things
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
returned
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
Miss
Matty
unlocked
her
desk
and
began
to
look
over
her
account
-
books
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
so
penitent
for
what
I
had
said
in
the
morning
,
that
I
did
not
choose
to
take
upon
myself
the
presumption
to
suppose
that
I
could
assist
her
;
I
rather
left
her
alone
,
as
,
with
puzzled
brow
,
her
eye
followed
her
pen
up
and
down
the
ruled
page
.
 
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
she
shut
the
book
,
locked
the
desk
,
and
came
and
drew
a
chair
to
mine
,
where
I
sat
in
moody
sorrow
over
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
I
stole
my
hand
into
hers
;
she
clasped
it
,
but
did
not
speak
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
she
said
,
with
forced
composure
in
her
voice
,
"
If
that
bank
goes
wrong
,
I
shall
lose
one
hundred
and
forty
-
nine
pounds
thirteen
shillings
and
fourpence
a
year
;
I
shall
only
have
thirteen
pounds
a
year
left
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
squeezed
her
hand
hard
and
tight
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
what
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
(
it
was
too
dark
to
see
her
face
)
<EOS>
I
felt
her
fingers
work
convulsively
in
my
grasp
;
and
I
knew
she
was
going
to
speak
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
heard
the
sobs
in
her
voice
as
she
said
,
"
I
hope
it
's
not
wrong
 
not
wicked
 
but
,
oh
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
so
glad
<EOS>
poor
Deborah
is
spared
this
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
borne
to
come
down
in
the
world
 
<EOS>
she
had
such
a
noble
,
lofty
spirit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
all
she
said
about
the
sister
who
had
insisted
upon
investing
their
little
property
in
that
unlucky
bank
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
later
in
lighting
the
candle
than
usual
that
night
,
and
until
that
light
shamed
us
into
speaking
,
we
sat
together
very
silently
and
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
we
took
to
our
work
after
tea
with
a
kind
of
forced
cheerfulness
(
which
soon
became
real
as
far
as
it
went
)
,
talking
of
that
never
-
ending
wonder
,
Lady
Glenmire
's
engagement
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
was
almost
coming
round
to
think
it
a
good
thing
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
to
deny
that
men
are
troublesome
in
a
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
judge
from
my
own
experience
,
for
my
father
was
neatness
itself
,
and
wiped
his
shoes
on
coming
in
as
carefully
as
any
woman
;
but
still
a
man
has
a
sort
of
knowledge
of
what
should
be
done
in
difficulties
,
that
it
is
very
pleasant
to
have
one
at
hand
ready
to
lean
upon
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Lady
Glenmire
,
instead
of
being
tossed
about
,
and
wondering
where
she
is
to
settle
,
will
be
certain
of
a
home
among
pleasant
and
kind
people
,
such
as
our
good
Miss
Pole
and
Mrs
Forrester
.
 
<EOS>
And
Mr
Hoggins
is
really
a
very
personable
man
;
and
as
for
his
manners
,
why
,
if
they
are
not
very
polished
,
I
have
known
people
with
very
good
hearts
and
very
clever
minds
too
,
who
were
not
what
some
people
reckoned
refined
,
but
who
were
both
true
and
tender
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
fell
off
into
a
soft
reverie
about
Mr
Holbrook
,
and
I
did
not
interrupt
her
<EOS>
,
I
was
so
busy
maturing
a
plan
I
had
had
in
my
mind
for
some
days
,
but
which
this
threatened
failure
of
the
bank
had
brought
to
a
crisis
.
 
<EOS>
That
night
,
after
Miss
Matty
went
to
bed
,
I
treacherously
lighted
the
candle
again
,
and
sat
down
in
the
drawing
-
room
to
compose
a
letter
to
the
Aga
Jenkyns
,
a
letter
which
should
affect
him
if
he
were
Peter
,
and
yet
seem
a
mere
statement
of
dry
facts
if
he
were
a
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
The
church
clock
pealed
out
two
before
I
had
done
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
news
came
,
both
official
and
otherwise
,
that
the
Town
and
County
Bank
had
stopped
payment
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
was
ruined
.
  
<EOS>
She
tried
to
speak
quietly
to
me
;
but
when
she
came
to
the
actual
fact
that
she
would
have
but
about
five
shillings
a
week
to
live
upon
,
she
could
not
restrain
a
few
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
crying
for
myself
,
dear
,
"
said
she
,
wiping
them
away
;
"
I
believe
I
am
crying
for
the
very
silly
thought
of
how
my
mother
would
grieve
if
she
could
know
;
she
always
cared
for
us
so
much
more
than
for
herself
.
 
<EOS>
But
many
a
poor
person
has
less
,
and
I
am
not
very
extravagant
,
and
,
thank
God
,
when
the
neck
of
mutton
,
and
Martha
's
wages
,
and
the
rent
are
paid
,
I
have
not
a
farthing
owing
.
<EOS>
Poor
Martha
!
 
<EOS>
I
think
she
'll
be
sorry
to
leave
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
smiled
at
me
through
her
tears
,
and
she
would
fain
have
had
me
see
only
the
smile
,
not
the
tears
.
   
<EOS>
FRIENDS
IN
NEED
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
example
to
me
,
and
I
fancy
it
might
be
to
many
others
,
to
see
how
immediately
Miss
Matty
set
about
the
retrenchment
which
she
knew
to
be
right
under
her
altered
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
While
she
went
down
to
speak
to
Martha
,
and
break
the
intelligence
to
her
,
I
stole
out
with
my
letter
to
the
Aga
Jenkyns
,
and
went
to
the
signor
's
lodgings
to
obtain
the
exact
address
.
 
<EOS>
I
bound
the
signora
to
secrecy
;
and
indeed
her
military
manners
had
a
degree
of
shortness
and
reserve
in
them
which
made
her
always
say
as
little
as
possible
,
except
when
under
the
pressure
of
strong
excitement
.
<EOS>
Moreover
(
which
made
my
secret
doubly
sure
)
,
the
signor
was
now
so
far
recovered
as
to
be
looking
forward
to
travelling
and
conjuring
again
in
the
space
of
a
few
days
,
when
he
,
his
wife
,
and
little
Phoebe
would
leave
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
found
him
looking
over
a
great
black
and
red
placard
,
in
which
the
Signor
Brunoni
's
accomplishments
were
set
forth
,
and
to
which
only
the
name
of
the
town
where
he
would
next
display
them
was
wanting
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
his
wife
were
so
much
absorbed
in
deciding
where
the
red
letters
would
come
in
with
most
effect
<EOS>
(
it
might
have
been
the
Rubric
for
that
matter
)
,
that
it
was
some
time
before
I
could
get
my
question
asked
privately
,
and
not
before
I
had
given
several
decisions
,
the
which
I
questioned
afterwards
with
equal
wisdom
of
sincerity
as
soon
as
the
signor
threw
in
his
doubts
and
reasons
on
the
important
subject
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
I
got
the
address
,
<EOS>
spelt
by
sound
,
and
very
queer
<EOS>
it
looked
.
 
<EOS>
I
dropped
it
in
the
post
on
my
way
home
,
and
then
for
a
minute
I
stood
looking
at
the
wooden
pane
with
a
gaping
slit
which
divided
me
from
the
letter
but
a
moment
ago
in
my
hand
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
gone
from
me
like
life
,
never
to
be
recalled
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
get
tossed
about
on
the
sea
,
and
stained
with
sea
-
waves
perhaps
,
and
be
carried
among
palm
-
trees
,
and
scented
with
all
tropical
fragrance
;
the
little
piece
of
paper
,
but
an
hour
ago
so
familiar
and
commonplace
,
had
set
out
on
its
race
to
the
strange
wild
countries
beyond
the
Ganges
!
 
<EOS>
But
I
could
not
afford
to
lose
much
time
on
this
speculation
.
 
<EOS>
I
hastened
home
,
that
Miss
Matty
might
not
miss
me
.
 
<EOS>
Martha
opened
the
door
to
me
,
her
face
swollen
with
crying
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
saw
me
she
burst
out
afresh
,
and
taking
hold
of
my
arm
<EOS>
she
pulled
me
in
,
and
banged
the
door
to
,
in
order
to
ask
me
if
indeed
it
was
all
true
that
Miss
Matty
had
been
saying
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
never
leave
her
!
 
<EOS>
No
;
I
wo
n't
.
 
<EOS>
I
telled
her
so
,
and
said
I
could
not
think
how
she
could
find
in
her
heart
to
give
me
warning
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
had
the
face
to
do
it
,
if
I
'd
been
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
might
ha
'
been
just
as
good
for
nothing
as
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
's
Rosy
,
who
struck
for
wages
after
living
seven
years
and
a
half
in
one
place
.
<EOS>
I
said
I
was
not
one
to
go
and
serve
Mammon
at
that
rate
;
that
I
knew
when
I
'd
got
a
good
missus
,
if
she
did
n't
know
when
she
'd
got
a
good
servant
<EOS>
"
     
"
<EOS>
But
,
Martha
,
"
said
I
,
cutting
in
while
she
wiped
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
,
"
but
Martha
"
me
,
"
she
replied
to
my
deprecatory
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
reason
"
     
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
listen
to
reason
,
"
she
said
,
now
in
full
possession
of
her
voice
,
which
had
been
rather
choked
with
sobbing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Reason
always
means
what
someone
else
has
got
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
think
what
I
've
got
to
say
is
good
enough
reason
;
but
reason
or
not
,
I
'll
say
it
,
and
I
'll
stick
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
money
in
the
Savings
Bank
,
and
I
've
a
good
stock
of
clothes
,
and
I
'm
not
going
to
leave
Miss
Matty
.
<EOS>
No
,
not
if
she
gives
me
warning
every
hour
in
the
day
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
put
her
arms
akimbo
,
as
much
as
to
say
she
defied
me
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
could
hardly
tell
how
to
begin
to
remonstrate
with
her
,
so
much
did
I
feel
that
Miss
Matty
,
in
her
increasing
infirmity
,
needed
the
attendance
of
this
kind
and
faithful
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
"
 
s
aid
I
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
thankful
you
begin
with
"
well
!
"
 
<EOS>
If
you
'd
have
begun
with
"
<EOS>
but
,
"
as
you
did
afore
,
I
'd
not
ha
'
listened
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Now
you
may
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
would
be
a
great
loss
to
Miss
Matty
,
Martha
<EOS>
"
     
"
I
telled
her
so
.
 
<EOS>
A
loss
she
'd
never
cease
to
be
sorry
for
,
"
broke
in
Martha
triumphantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Still
,
she
will
have
so
little
 
<EOS>
so
very
little
 
to
live
upon
<EOS>
,
that
I
do
n't
see
just
now
how
she
could
find
you
food
 
<EOS>
she
will
even
be
pressed
for
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
this
,
Martha
,
because
I
feel
you
are
like
a
friend
to
dear
Miss
Matty
,
but
you
know
she
might
not
like
to
have
it
spoken
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
Apparently
this
was
even
a
blacker
view
of
the
subject
than
Miss
Matty
had
presented
to
her
,
for
Martha
just
sat
down
on
the
first
chair
that
came
to
hand
,
and
cried
out
loud
(
we
had
been
standing
in
the
kitchen
)
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
she
put
her
apron
down
,
and
looking
me
earnestly
in
the
face
,
asked
,
"
Was
that
the
reason
Miss
Matty
would
n't
order
a
pudding
to
-
day
?
 
<EOS>
She
said
she
had
no
great
fancy
for
sweet
things
,
and
you
and
she
would
just
have
a
mutton
chop
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
be
up
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
Never
you
tell
,
but
I
'll
make
her
a
pudding
,
and
a
pudding
she
'll
like
,
too
,
and
I
'll
pay
for
it
myself
;
so
mind
you
see
she
eats
it
.
 
<EOS>
Many
a
one
has
been
comforted
in
their
sorrow
by
seeing
a
good
dish
come
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
rather
glad
that
Martha
's
energy
had
taken
the
immediate
and
practical
direction
of
pudding
-
making
,
for
it
staved
off
the
quarrelsome
discussion
as
to
<EOS>
whether
she
should
or
should
not
leave
Miss
Matty
's
service
.
 
<EOS>
She
began
to
tie
on
a
clean
apron
,
and
otherwise
prepare
herself
for
going
to
the
shop
for
the
butter
,
eggs
,
and
what
else
she
might
require
.
 
<EOS>
She
would
not
use
a
scrap
of
the
articles
already
in
the
house
for
her
cookery
,
but
went
to
an
old
tea
-
pot
in
which
her
private
store
of
money
was
deposited
,
and
took
out
what
she
wanted
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
Miss
Matty
very
quiet
,
and
not
a
little
sad
;
but
by
-
and
-
by
she
tried
to
smile
for
my
sake
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
settled
that
I
was
to
write
to
my
father
,
and
ask
him
to
come
over
and
hold
a
consultation
,
and
as
soon
as
this
letter
was
despatched
we
began
to
talk
over
future
plans
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
's
idea
was
to
take
a
single
room
,
and
retain
as
much
of
her
furniture
as
would
be
necessary
to
fit
up
this
,
and
sell
the
rest
,
and
there
to
quietly
exist
upon
what
would
remain
after
paying
the
rent
.
 
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
was
more
ambitious
and
less
contented
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
of
all
the
things
by
which
a
woman
,
past
middle
age
,
and
with
the
education
common
to
ladies
fifty
years
ago
,
could
earn
or
add
to
a
living
without
materially
losing
caste
;
but
at
length
I
put
even
this
last
clause
on
one
side
,
and
wondered
what
in
the
world
Miss
Matty
could
do
.
  
<EOS>
Teaching
was
,
of
course
,
the
first
thing
that
suggested
itself
.
 
<EOS>
If
Miss
Matty
could
teach
children
anything
,
it
would
throw
her
among
the
little
elves
in
whom
her
soul
delighted
.
 
<EOS>
I
ran
over
her
accomplishments
.
 
<EOS>
Once
upon
a
time
I
had
heard
her
say
she
could
play
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
vous
dirai
-
je
,
maman
?
<EOS>
"
on
the
piano
,
<EOS>
but
that
was
long
,
long
ago
;
that
faint
shadow
of
musical
acquirement
had
died
out
years
before
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
also
once
been
able
to
trace
out
patterns
very
nicely
for
muslin
embroidery
,
by
dint
of
placing
a
piece
of
silver
paper
over
the
design
to
be
copied
,
and
holding
both
against
the
window
-
pane
while
she
marked
the
scollop
and
eyelet
-
holes
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
was
her
nearest
approach
to
the
accomplishment
of
drawing
,
and
I
did
not
think
it
would
go
very
far
.
 
<EOS>
Then
again
,
as
to
the
branches
of
a
solid
English
education
 
fancy
work
and
the
use
of
the
globes
 
such
as
the
mistress
of
the
Ladies
'
Seminary
,
to
which
all
the
tradespeople
in
Cranford
sent
their
daughters
,
professed
to
teach
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
's
eyes
were
failing
her
,
and
I
doubted
if
she
could
discover
the
number
of
threads
in
a
worsted
-
work
pattern
,
or
rightly
appreciate
the
different
shades
required
for
Queen
Adelaide
's
face
in
the
loyal
wool
-
work
now
fashionable
in
Cranford
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
use
of
the
globes
,
I
had
never
been
able
to
find
it
out
myself
,
so
perhaps
I
was
not
a
good
judge
of
Miss
Matty
's
capability
of
instructing
in
this
branch
of
education
;
but
it
struck
me
that
equators
and
tropics
,
and
such
mystical
circles
,
were
very
imaginary
lines
indeed
to
her
,
and
that
she
looked
upon
the
signs
of
the
Zodiac
as
so
many
remnants
of
the
Black
Art
.
  
<EOS>
What
she
piqued
herself
upon
,
as
arts
in
which
she
excelled
,
was
making
candle
-
lighters
,
or
"
spills
"
(
as
she
preferred
calling
them
)
,
of
coloured
paper
,
cut
so
as
to
resemble
feathers
,
and
knitting
garters
in
a
variety
of
dainty
stitches
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
once
said
,
on
receiving
a
present
of
an
elaborate
pair
,
that
I
should
feel
quite
tempted
to
drop
one
of
them
in
the
street
,
in
order
to
have
it
admired
;
but
I
found
this
little
joke
(
and
it
was
a
very
little
one
)
was
such
a
distress
to
her
sense
of
propriety
,
and
was
taken
with
such
anxious
,
earnest
alarm
,
lest
the
temptation
might
some
day
prove
too
strong
for
me
,
that
I
quite
regretted
having
ventured
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
present
of
these
delicately
-
wrought
garters
,
a
bunch
of
gay
"
spills
,
"
or
a
set
of
cards
on
which
sewing
-
silk
was
wound
in
a
mystical
manner
,
were
the
well
-
known
tokens
of
Miss
Matty
's
favour
.
<EOS>
But
would
any
one
pay
to
have
their
children
taught
these
arts
?
<EOS>
or
,
indeed
,
would
Miss
Matty
sell
,
for
filthy
lucre
,
the
knack
and
the
skill
with
which
she
made
trifles
of
value
to
those
who
loved
her
?
  
<EOS>
I
had
to
come
down
to
reading
,
writing
,
and
arithmetic
;
and
,
in
reading
the
chapter
every
morning
,
she
always
coughed
before
coming
to
long
words
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubted
her
power
of
getting
through
a
genealogical
chapter
,
with
any
number
of
coughs
.
 
<EOS>
Writing
<EOS>
she
did
well
and
delicately
 
but
spelling
!
 
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
think
that
the
more
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
this
was
,
and
the
more
trouble
it
cost
her
,
the
greater
the
compliment
she
paid
to
her
correspondent
;
and
words
that
she
would
spell
quite
correctly
in
her
letters
to
me
became
perfect
enigmas
when
she
wrote
to
my
father
.
  
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
there
was
nothing
she
could
teach
to
the
rising
generation
of
Cranford
,
unless
they
had
been
quick
learners
and
ready
imitators
of
her
patience
,
her
humility
,
her
sweetness
,
her
quiet
contentment
with
all
that
she
could
not
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
pondered
and
pondered
until
dinner
was
announced
by
Martha
,
with
a
face
all
blubbered
and
swollen
with
crying
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
had
a
few
little
peculiarities
which
Martha
was
apt
to
regard
as
whims
below
her
attention
,
and
appeared
to
consider
as
childish
fancies
of
which
an
old
lady
of
fifty
-
eight
should
try
and
cure
herself
.
 
<EOS>
But
to
-
day
everything
was
attended
to
with
the
most
careful
regard
.
 
<EOS>
The
bread
was
cut
to
the
imaginary
pattern
of
excellence
that
existed
in
Miss
Matty
's
mind
,
as
being
the
way
which
her
mother
had
preferred
,
the
curtain
was
drawn
so
as
to
exclude
the
dead
brick
wall
of
a
neighbour
's
stable
,
and
yet
left
so
as
to
show
every
tender
leaf
of
the
poplar
which
was
bursting
into
spring
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
Martha
's
tone
to
Miss
Matty
was
just
such
as
that
good
,
rough
-
spoken
servant
usually
kept
sacred
for
little
children
,
and
which
I
had
never
heard
her
use
to
any
grown
-
up
person
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
forgotten
to
tell
Miss
Matty
about
the
pudding
,
and
I
was
afraid
she
might
not
do
justice
to
it
,
for
she
had
evidently
very
little
appetite
this
day
;
so
I
seized
the
opportunity
of
letting
her
into
the
secret
while
Martha
took
away
the
meat
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
's
eyes
filled
with
tears
,
and
she
could
not
speak
,
either
to
express
surprise
or
delight
,
when
Martha
returned
bearing
it
aloft
,
made
in
the
most
wonderful
representation
of
a
lion
couchant
that
ever
was
moulded
.
 
<EOS>
Martha
's
face
gleamed
with
triumph
as
she
set
it
down
before
Miss
Matty
with
an
exultant
"
There
!
"
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
wanted
to
speak
her
thanks
,
but
could
not
;
so
she
took
Martha
's
hand
and
shook
it
warmly
,
which
set
Martha
off
crying
,
and
I
myself
could
hardly
keep
up
the
necessary
composure
.
 
<EOS>
Martha
burst
out
of
the
room
,
and
Miss
Matty
had
to
clear
her
voice
once
or
twice
before
she
could
speak
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
she
said
,
"
I
should
like
to
keep
this
pudding
under
a
glass
shade
,
my
dear
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
notion
of
the
lion
couchant
,
with
his
currant
eyes
,
being
hoisted
up
to
the
place
of
honour
on
a
mantelpiece
,
tickled
my
hysterical
fancy
,
and
I
began
to
laugh
,
which
rather
surprised
Miss
Matty
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
dear
,
I
have
seen
uglier
things
under
a
glass
shade
before
now
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
So
had
I
,
many
a
time
and
oft
,
and
I
accordingly
composed
my
countenance
(
and
now
I
could
hardly
keep
from
crying
)
,
and
we
both
fell
to
upon
the
pudding
,
which
was
indeed
excellent
 
<EOS>
only
every
morsel
seemed
to
choke
us
,
our
hearts
were
so
full
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
too
much
to
think
about
to
talk
much
that
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
It
passed
over
very
tranquilly
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
the
tea
-
urn
was
brought
in
a
new
thought
came
into
my
head
.
 
<EOS>
Why
should
not
Miss
Matty
sell
tea
 
<EOS>
be
an
agent
to
the
East
India
Tea
Company
which
then
existed
?
 
<EOS>
I
could
see
no
objections
to
this
plan
,
while
the
advantages
were
many
 
always
supposing
that
Miss
Matty
could
get
over
the
degradation
of
condescending
to
anything
like
trade
.
 
<EOS>
Tea
was
neither
greasy
nor
sticky
 
<EOS>
grease
and
stickiness
being
two
of
the
qualities
which
Miss
Matty
could
not
endure
.
 
<EOS>
No
shop
-
window
would
be
required
.
 
<EOS>
A
small
,
genteel
notification
of
her
being
licensed
to
sell
tea
<EOS>
would
,
it
is
true
,
be
necessary
,
but
I
hoped
that
it
could
be
placed
where
no
one
would
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
was
tea
a
heavy
article
,
so
as
to
tax
Miss
Matty
's
fragile
strength
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
thing
against
my
plan
was
the
buying
and
selling
involved
.
  
<EOS>
While
I
was
giving
but
absent
answers
to
the
questions
Miss
Matty
was
putting
 
almost
as
absently
 
we
heard
a
clumping
sound
on
the
stairs
,
and
a
whispering
outside
the
door
,
which
indeed
once
opened
and
shut
as
if
by
some
invisible
agency
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
little
while
Martha
came
in
,
dragging
after
her
a
great
tall
young
man
,
all
crimson
with
shyness
,
and
finding
his
only
relief
in
perpetually
sleeking
down
his
hair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Please
,
ma'am
,
he
's
only
Jem
Hearn
,
"
said
Martha
,
by
way
of
an
introduction
;
and
so
out
of
breath
was
she
that
I
imagine
she
had
had
some
bodily
struggle
before
she
could
overcome
his
reluctance
to
be
presented
on
the
courtly
scene
of
Miss
Matilda
Jenkyns
's
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
please
,
ma'am
,
he
wants
to
marry
me
off
-
hand
.
 
<EOS>
And
please
,
ma'am
,
we
want
to
take
a
lodger
 
just
one
quiet
lodger
,
to
make
our
two
ends
meet
;
and
we
'd
take
any
house
conformable
;
and
,
<EOS>
oh
dear
Miss
Matty
,
if
I
may
be
so
bold
,
would
you
have
any
objections
to
lodging
with
us
?
 
<EOS>
Jem
wants
it
as
much
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
[
To
Jem
]
 
<EOS>
"
You
great
oaf
!
<EOS>
why
ca
n't
you
back
me
!
 
<EOS>
But
he
does
want
it
all
the
same
,
very
bad
 
<EOS>
do
n't
you
,
Jem
?
 
<EOS>
only
,
you
see
,
he
's
dazed
at
being
called
on
to
speak
before
quality
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
that
,
"
broke
in
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
that
you
've
taken
me
all
on
a
sudden
,
and
I
did
n't
think
for
to
get
married
so
soon
 
and
such
quick
words
does
flabbergast
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
not
that
I
'm
against
it
,
ma'am
"
<EOS>
(
addressing
Miss
Matty
)
,
"
only
Martha
has
such
quick
ways
with
her
when
once
she
takes
a
thing
into
her
head
;
and
marriage
,
<EOS>
ma'am
 
marriage
nails
a
man
,
as
one
may
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
I
sha
n't
mind
it
after
it
's
once
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Please
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Martha
 
who
had
plucked
at
his
sleeve
,
and
nudged
him
with
her
elbow
,
and
otherwise
tried
to
interrupt
him
all
the
time
he
had
been
speaking
 
"
do
n't
mind
him
,
he
'll
come
to
;
'
<EOS>
twas
<EOS>
only
last
night
he
was
an
-
axing
me
,
and
an
-
axing
me
,
and
all
the
more
because
I
said
I
could
not
think
of
it
for
years
to
come
,
and
now
he
's
only
taken
aback
with
the
suddenness
of
the
joy
;
but
you
know
,
Jem
<EOS>
,
you
are
just
as
full
as
me
about
wanting
a
lodger
.
"
<EOS>
(
Another
great
nudge
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
if
Miss
Matty
would
lodge
with
us
 
<EOS>
otherwise
I
've
no
mind
to
be
cumbered
with
strange
folk
in
the
house
,
"
said
Jem
,
with
a
want
of
tact
which
I
could
see
enraged
Martha
,
who
was
trying
to
represent
a
lodger
as
the
great
object
they
wished
to
obtain
,
and
that
,
in
fact
,
Miss
Matty
would
be
smoothing
their
path
and
conferring
a
favour
,
if
she
would
only
come
and
live
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
herself
was
bewildered
by
the
pair
;
their
,
or
rather
Martha
's
sudden
resolution
in
favour
of
matrimony
staggered
her
,
and
stood
between
her
and
the
contemplation
of
the
plan
which
Martha
had
at
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
began
     
"
Marriage
is
a
very
solemn
thing
,
Martha
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
indeed
,
ma'am
,
"
quoth
Jem
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
that
I
've
no
objections
to
Martha
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
never
let
me
a
-
be
for
asking
me
for
to
fix
when
I
would
be
married
,
"
said
Martha
 
her
face
all
a
-
fire
,
and
ready
to
cry
with
vexation
 
"
<EOS>
and
now
you
're
shaming
me
before
my
missus
and
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
now
!
 
<EOS>
Martha
do
n't
ee
!
<EOS>
do
n't
ee
!
<EOS>
only
a
man
likes
to
have
breathing
-
time
,
"
said
Jem
,
trying
to
possess
himself
of
her
hand
,
but
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
Then
seeing
that
she
was
more
seriously
hurt
than
he
had
imagined
,
he
seemed
to
try
to
rally
his
scattered
faculties
,
and
with
more
straightforward
dignity
than
,
ten
minutes
before
,
I
should
have
thought
it
possible
for
him
to
assume
,
he
turned
to
Miss
Matty
,
and
said
,
"
I
hope
,
ma'am
,
you
know
that
I
am
bound
to
respect
every
one
who
has
been
kind
to
Martha
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
looked
on
her
as
to
be
my
wife
 
<EOS>
some
time
;
and
she
has
often
and
often
spoken
of
you
as
the
kindest
lady
that
ever
was
;
and
though
the
plain
truth
is
,
I
would
not
like
to
be
troubled
with
lodgers
of
the
common
run
,
yet
if
,
ma'am
,
you
'd
honour
us
by
living
with
us
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
Martha
would
do
her
best
to
make
you
comfortable
;
and
I
'd
keep
out
of
your
way
as
much
as
I
could
,
which
I
reckon
would
be
the
best
kindness
<EOS>
such
an
awkward
chap
as
me
could
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
had
been
very
busy
with
taking
off
her
spectacles
,
wiping
them
,
and
replacing
them
;
but
all
she
could
say
was
,
"
Do
n't
let
any
thought
of
me
hurry
you
into
marriage
:
 
pray
do
n't
.
<EOS>
Marriage
is
such
a
very
solemn
thing
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
Miss
Matilda
will
think
of
your
plan
,
Martha
,
"
said
I
,
struck
with
the
advantages
that
it
offered
,
and
unwilling
to
lose
the
opportunity
of
considering
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
'm
sure
neither
she
nor
I
can
ever
forget
your
kindness
;
nor
your
's
either
,
Jem
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
,
ma'am
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
mean
kindly
,
though
I
'm
a
bit
fluttered
by
being
pushed
straight
ahead
into
matrimony
,
as
it
were
,
and
may
n't
express
myself
conformable
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'm
sure
I
'm
willing
enough
,
and
give
me
time
to
get
accustomed
;
so
,
Martha
,
<EOS>
wench
,
what
's
the
use
of
crying
so
,
and
slapping
me
if
I
come
near
?
"
  
<EOS>
This
last
was
sotto
voce
,
and
had
the
effect
of
making
Martha
bounce
out
of
the
room
,
to
be
followed
and
soothed
by
her
lover
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
Miss
Matty
sat
down
and
cried
very
heartily
,
and
accounted
for
it
by
saying
that
the
thought
of
Martha
being
married
so
soon
gave
her
quite
a
shock
,
and
that
she
should
never
forgive
herself
if
she
thought
she
was
hurrying
the
poor
creature
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
my
pity
was
more
for
Jem
,
of
the
two
;
but
both
Miss
Matty
and
I
appreciated
to
the
full
the
kindness
of
the
honest
couple
,
although
we
said
little
about
this
,
and
a
good
deal
about
the
chances
and
dangers
of
matrimony
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
,
very
early
,
I
received
a
note
from
Miss
Pole
,
so
mysteriously
wrapped
up
,
and
with
so
many
seals
on
it
to
secure
secrecy
,
that
I
had
to
tear
the
paper
before
I
could
unfold
it
.
<EOS>
And
when
I
came
to
the
writing
I
could
hardly
understand
the
meaning
,
it
was
so
involved
and
oracular
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
out
,
however
,
that
I
was
to
go
to
Miss
Pole
's
at
eleven
o'clock
;
the
number
ELEVEN
being
written
in
full
length
as
well
as
in
numerals
,
and
<EOS>
A.M.
twice
dashed
under
,
as
if
I
were
very
likely
to
come
at
eleven
at
night
,
when
all
Cranford
was
usually
a
-
bed
and
asleep
by
ten
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
signature
except
Miss
Pole
's
initials
reversed
,
P.E.
;
but
as
Martha
had
given
me
the
note
,
"
with
Miss
Pole
's
kind
regards
,
"
it
needed
no
wizard
to
find
out
who
sent
it
;
and
if
the
writer
's
name
was
to
be
kept
secret
,
it
was
very
well
that
I
was
alone
when
Martha
delivered
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
as
requested
to
Miss
Pole
's
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
was
opened
to
me
by
her
little
maid
Lizzy
in
Sunday
trim
,
as
if
some
grand
event
was
impending
over
this
work
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
drawing
-
room
upstairs
was
arranged
in
accordance
with
this
idea
.
 
<EOS>
The
table
was
set
out
with
the
best
green
card
-
cloth
,
and
writing
materials
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
little
chiffonier
was
a
tray
with
a
newly
-
decanted
bottle
of
cowslip
wine
,
and
some
ladies'-finger
biscuits
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
herself
was
in
solemn
array
,
as
if
to
receive
visitors
,
although
it
was
only
eleven
o'clock
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
was
there
,
crying
quietly
and
sadly
,
and
my
arrival
seemed
only
to
call
forth
fresh
tears
.
<EOS>
Before
we
had
finished
our
greetings
,
performed
with
lugubrious
mystery
of
demeanour
,
there
was
another
rat
-
tat
-
tat
,
and
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
appeared
,
crimson
with
walking
and
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
this
was
all
the
company
expected
;
for
now
Miss
Pole
made
several
demonstrations
of
being
about
to
open
the
business
of
the
meeting
,
by
stirring
the
fire
,
opening
and
shutting
the
door
,
and
coughing
and
blowing
her
nose
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
arranged
us
all
round
the
table
,
taking
care
to
place
me
opposite
to
her
;
and
last
of
all
,
she
inquired
of
me
if
the
sad
report
was
true
,
as
she
feared
it
was
,
that
Miss
Matty
had
lost
all
her
fortune
?
  
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
had
<EOS>
but
one
answer
to
make
;
and
<EOS>
I
never
saw
more
unaffected
sorrow
depicted
on
any
countenances
than
I
did
there
on
the
three
before
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
Mrs
Jamieson
was
here
!
"
said
Mrs
Forrester
at
last
;
but
to
judge
from
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
's
face
,
she
could
not
second
the
wish
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
without
Mrs
Jamieson
,
"
said
Miss
Pole
,
with
just
a
sound
of
offended
merit
in
her
voice
,
"
we
,
the
ladies
of
Cranford
,
in
my
drawing
-
room
assembled
,
can
resolve
upon
something
.
 
<EOS>
I
imagine
we
are
none
of
us
what
may
be
called
rich
,
though
we
all
possess
a
genteel
competency
,
sufficient
for
tastes
that
are
elegant
and
refined
,
and
would
not
,
if
they
could
,
be
vulgarly
ostentatious
.
"
<EOS>
(
Here
I
observed
Miss
Pole
refer
to
a
small
card
concealed
in
her
hand
,
on
which
I
imagine
she
had
put
down
a
few
notes
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Smith
,
"
she
continued
,
addressing
me
(
familiarly
known
as
"
Mary
"
to
all
the
company
assembled
,
but
this
was
a
state
occasion
)
,
"
I
have
conversed
in
private
 
<EOS>
I
made
it
my
business
to
do
so
yesterday
afternoon
 
with
these
ladies
on
the
misfortune
which
has
happened
to
our
friend
,
and
one
and
all
of
us
have
agreed
that
while
we
have
a
superfluity
,
it
is
not
only
a
duty
,
but
a
pleasure
 
a
true
pleasure
,
Mary
!
"
 
<EOS>
her
voice
was
rather
choked
just
here
,
and
she
had
to
wipe
her
spectacles
before
she
could
go
on
 
"
to
give
what
we
can
to
assist
her
 
Miss
Matilda
Jenkyns
.
 
<EOS>
Only
in
consideration
of
the
feelings
of
delicate
independence
existing
in
the
mind
of
every
refined
female
"
 
<EOS>
I
 
was
sure
she
had
got
back
to
the
card
now
 
<EOS>
"
we
wish
to
contribute
our
mites
in
a
secret
and
concealed
manner
,
so
as
not
to
hurt
the
feelings
I
have
referred
to
.
 
<EOS>
And
our
object
in
requesting
you
to
meet
us
this
morning
is
that
,
believing
you
are
the
daughter
 
that
your
father
is
,
in
fact
,
her
confidential
adviser
,
in
all
pecuniary
matters
,
we
imagined
that
,
by
consulting
with
him
,
you
might
devise
some
mode
in
which
our
contribution
could
be
made
to
appear
the
legal
due
which
Miss
Matilda
Jenkyns
ought
to
receive
from
 
Probably
your
father
,
knowing
her
investments
,
can
fill
up
the
blank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
concluded
her
address
,
and
looked
round
for
approval
and
agreement
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
expressed
your
meaning
,
ladies
,
have
I
not
?
 
<EOS>
And
while
Miss
Smith
considers
what
reply
to
make
,
allow
me
to
offer
you
some
little
refreshment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
no
great
reply
to
make
:
 
<EOS>
I
had
more
thankfulness
at
my
heart
for
their
kind
thoughts
than
I
cared
to
put
into
words
;
and
so
I
only
mumbled
out
something
to
the
effect
"
that
I
would
name
what
Miss
Pole
had
said
to
my
father
,
and
that
if
anything
could
be
arranged
for
dear
Miss
Matty
,
"
 
and
here
I
broke
down
utterly
,
and
had
to
be
refreshed
with
a
glass
of
cowslip
wine
before
I
could
check
the
crying
which
had
been
repressed
for
the
last
two
or
three
days
.
 
<EOS>
The
worst
was
,
all
the
ladies
cried
in
concert
.
 
<EOS>
Even
Miss
Pole
cried
,
who
had
said
a
hundred
times
that
to
betray
emotion
before
any
one
was
a
sign
of
weakness
and
want
of
self
-
control
.
<EOS>
She
recovered
herself
into
a
slight
degree
of
impatient
anger
,
directed
against
me
,
as
having
set
them
all
off
;
and
,
moreover
,
I
think
she
was
vexed
that
I
could
not
make
a
speech
back
in
return
for
hers
;
and
if
I
had
known
beforehand
what
was
to
be
said
,
and
had
a
card
on
which
to
express
the
probable
feelings
that
would
rise
in
my
heart
,
I
would
have
tried
to
gratify
her
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
Mrs
Forrester
was
the
person
to
speak
when
we
had
recovered
our
composure
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mind
,
among
friends
,
stating
that
I
 
no
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
not
poor
exactly
,
but
I
do
n't
think
I
'm
what
you
may
call
rich
<EOS>
;
I
wish
I
were
,
for
dear
Miss
Matty
's
sake
 
<EOS>
but
,
if
you
please
,
I
'll
write
down
in
a
sealed
paper
what
I
can
give
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
wish
it
was
more
;
my
dear
Mary
,
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
I
saw
why
paper
,
pens
,
and
ink
were
provided
.
 
<EOS>
Every
lady
wrote
down
the
sum
she
could
give
annually
,
signed
the
paper
,
and
sealed
it
mysteriously
.
 
<EOS>
If
their
proposal
was
acceded
to
,
my
father
was
to
be
allowed
to
open
the
papers
,
under
pledge
of
secrecy
.
 
<EOS>
If
not
,
they
were
to
be
returned
to
their
writers
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
ceremony
had
been
gone
through
,
I
rose
to
depart
;
but
each
lady
seemed
to
wish
to
have
a
private
conference
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
kept
me
in
the
drawing
-
room
to
explain
why
,
in
Mrs
Jamieson
's
absence
,
she
had
taken
the
lead
in
this
"
movement
,
"
as
she
was
pleased
to
call
it
,
and
also
to
inform
me
that
she
had
heard
from
good
sources
that
Mrs
Jamieson
was
coming
home
directly
in
a
state
of
high
displeasure
against
her
sister
-
in
-
law
,
who
was
forthwith
to
leave
her
house
,
and
was
,
she
believed
,
to
return
to
Edinburgh
that
very
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
this
piece
of
intelligence
could
not
be
communicated
before
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
,
more
especially
as
Miss
Pole
was
inclined
to
think
that
Lady
Glenmire
's
engagement
to
Mr
Hoggins
could
not
possibly
hold
against
the
blaze
of
Mrs
Jamieson
's
displeasure
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
hearty
inquiries
after
Miss
Matty
's
health
concluded
my
interview
with
Miss
Pole
.
  
<EOS>
On
coming
downstairs
I
found
Mrs
Forrester
waiting
for
me
at
the
entrance
to
the
dining
-
parlour
;
she
drew
me
in
,
and
when
the
door
was
shut
,
she
tried
two
or
three
times
to
begin
on
some
subject
,
which
was
so
unapproachable
apparently
,
that
I
began
to
despair
of
our
ever
getting
to
a
clear
understanding
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
out
it
came
;
the
poor
old
lady
trembling
all
the
time
as
if
it
were
a
great
crime
which
she
was
exposing
to
daylight
,
in
telling
me
how
very
,
very
little
she
had
to
live
upon
;
a
confession
which
she
was
brought
to
make
from
a
dread
lest
we
should
think
that
the
small
contribution
named
in
her
paper
bore
any
proportion
to
her
love
and
regard
for
Miss
Matty
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
that
sum
which
she
so
eagerly
relinquished
was
,
in
truth
,
<EOS>
more
than
a
twentieth
part
of
what
she
had
to
live
upon
,
and
keep
house
,
and
a
little
serving
-
maid
,
all
as
became
one
born
a
Tyrrell
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
the
whole
income
does
not
nearly
amount
to
a
hundred
pounds
,
to
give
up
a
twentieth
of
it
will
necessitate
many
careful
economies
,
and
many
pieces
of
self
-
denial
,
small
and
insignificant
in
the
world
's
account
,
but
bearing
a
different
value
in
another
account
-
book
that
I
have
heard
of
.
<EOS>
She
did
so
wish
she
was
rich
,
she
said
,
and
this
wish
she
kept
repeating
,
with
no
thought
of
herself
in
it
,
only
with
a
longing
,
yearning
desire
to
be
able
to
heap
up
Miss
Matty
's
measure
of
comforts
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
some
time
before
I
could
console
her
enough
to
leave
her
;
and
then
,
on
quitting
the
house
,
I
was
waylaid
by
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
,
who
had
also
her
confidence
to
make
of
pretty
nearly
the
opposite
description
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
not
liked
to
put
down
all
that
she
could
afford
and
was
ready
to
give
.
 
<EOS>
She
told
me
she
thought
she
never
could
look
Miss
Matty
in
the
face
again
if
she
presumed
to
be
giving
her
so
much
as
she
should
like
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Matty
!
<EOS>
"
continued
she
,
"
that
I
thought
was
such
a
fine
young
lady
when
I
was
nothing
but
a
country
girl
,
coming
to
market
with
eggs
and
butter
and
such
like
things
.
 
<EOS>
For
my
father
,
though
well
-
to
-
do
,
would
always
make
me
go
on
as
my
mother
had
done
before
me
,
and
I
had
to
come
into
Cranford
every
Saturday
,
and
see
after
sales
,
and
prices
,
and
what
not
.
 
<EOS>
And
one
day
,
I
remember
,
I
met
Miss
Matty
in
the
lane
that
leads
to
Combehurst
;
she
was
walking
on
the
footpath
,
which
,
you
know
,
is
raised
a
good
way
above
the
road
,
and
a
gentleman
rode
beside
her
,
and
was
talking
to
her
,
and
she
was
looking
down
at
some
primroses
she
had
gathered
,
and
pulling
them
all
to
pieces
,
and
I
do
believe
she
was
crying
.
 
<EOS>
But
after
she
had
passed
,
she
turned
round
and
ran
after
me
to
ask
 
oh
,
so
kindly
 
about
my
poor
mother
,
who
lay
on
her
death
-
bed
;
and
when
I
cried
she
took
hold
of
my
hand
to
comfort
me
 
and
the
gentleman
waiting
for
her
all
the
time
 
and
her
poor
heart
very
full
of
something
,
I
am
sure
;
and
I
thought
it
such
an
honour
to
be
spoken
to
in
that
pretty
way
by
the
rector
's
daughter
,
who
visited
at
Arley
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
loved
her
ever
since
,
though
perhaps
I
'd
no
right
to
do
it
;
but
if
you
can
think
of
any
way
in
which
I
might
be
allowed
to
give
a
little
more
without
any
one
knowing
it
,
I
should
be
so
much
obliged
to
you
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
brother
would
be
delighted
to
doctor
her
for
nothing
 
medicines
,
leeches
,
and
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
he
and
her
ladyship
(
my
dear
,
I
little
thought
in
the
days
<EOS>
I
was
telling
you
of
that
I
should
ever
come
to
be
sister
-
in
-
law
to
a
ladyship
!
)
<EOS>
would
do
anything
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
told
her
I
was
quite
sure
of
it
,
and
promised
all
sorts
of
things
in
my
anxiety
to
get
home
to
Miss
Matty
,
who
might
well
be
wondering
what
had
become
of
me
 
absent
from
her
two
hours
without
being
able
to
account
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
taken
very
little
note
of
time
,
however
,
as
she
had
been
occupied
in
numberless
little
arrangements
preparatory
to
the
great
step
of
giving
up
her
house
.
<EOS>
It
was
evidently
a
relief
to
her
to
be
doing
something
in
the
way
of
retrenchment
,
for
,
as
she
said
,
whenever
she
paused
to
think
,
the
recollection
of
the
poor
fellow
with
his
bad
five
-
pound
note
came
over
her
,
and
she
felt
quite
dishonest
;
only
if
it
made
her
so
uncomfortable
,
what
must
it
not
be
doing
to
the
directors
of
the
bank
,
who
must
know
so
much
more
of
the
misery
consequent
upon
this
failure
?
 
<EOS>
She
almost
made
me
angry
by
dividing
her
sympathy
between
these
directors
(
whom
she
imagined
overwhelmed
by
self
-
reproach
for
the
mismanagement
of
other
people
's
affairs
)
and
those
who
were
suffering
like
her
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
of
the
two
,
she
seemed
to
think
poverty
a
lighter
burden
than
self
-
reproach
;
but
I
privately
doubted
if
the
directors
would
agree
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
Old
hoards
were
taken
out
and
examined
as
to
their
money
value
which
luckily
was
small
,
or
else
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
Miss
Matty
would
have
prevailed
upon
herself
to
part
with
such
things
as
her
mother
's
wedding
-
ring
,
the
strange
,
uncouth
brooch
with
which
her
father
had
disfigured
his
shirt
-
frill
,
&
c.
 
<EOS>
However
,
we
arranged
things
a
little
in
order
as
to
their
pecuniary
estimation
,
and
were
all
ready
for
my
father
when
he
came
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
not
going
to
weary
you
with
the
details
of
all
the
business
we
went
through
;
and
one
reason
for
not
telling
about
them
is
,
that
I
did
not
understand
what
we
were
doing
at
the
time
,
and
can
not
recollect
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
and
I
sat
assenting
to
accounts
,
and
schemes
,
and
reports
,
and
documents
,
of
which
I
do
not
believe
we
either
of
us
understood
a
word
;
for
my
father
was
clear
-
headed
and
decisive
,
and
a
capital
man
of
business
,
and
if
we
made
the
slightest
inquiry
,
or
expressed
the
slightest
want
of
comprehension
,
he
had
a
sharp
way
of
saying
,
"
Eh
?
<EOS>
eh
?
<EOS>
it
's
as
dear
as
daylight
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
your
objection
?
"
 
<EOS>
And
as
we
had
not
comprehended
anything
of
what
he
had
proposed
,
we
found
it
rather
difficult
to
shape
our
objections
;
in
fact
,
we
never
were
sure
if
we
had
any
.
 
<EOS>
So
presently
Miss
Matty
got
into
a
nervously
acquiescent
state
,
and
said
"
Yes
,
"
and
"
<EOS>
Certainly
,
"
at
every
pause
,
whether
required
or
not
;
but
when
I
once
joined
in
as
chorus
to
a
"
Decidedly
,
"
pronounced
by
Miss
Matty
in
a
tremblingly
dubious
tone
,
my
father
fired
round
at
me
and
asked
me
"
What
there
was
to
decide
?
"
 
<EOS>
And
I
am
sure
to
this
day
I
have
never
known
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
justice
to
him
,
I
must
say
he
had
come
over
from
Drumble
to
help
Miss
Matty
when
he
could
ill
spare
the
time
,
and
when
his
own
affairs
were
in
a
very
anxious
state
.
  
<EOS>
While
Miss
Matty
was
out
of
the
room
giving
orders
for
luncheon
 
and
sadly
perplexed
between
her
desire
of
honouring
my
father
by
a
delicate
,
dainty
meal
,
and
her
conviction
that
she
had
no
right
,
now
that
all
her
money
was
gone
,
to
indulge
this
desire
 
I
told
him
of
the
meeting
of
the
Cranford
ladies
at
Miss
Pole
's
the
day
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
kept
brushing
his
hand
before
his
eyes
as
I
spoke
 
<EOS>
and
when
I
went
back
to
Martha
's
offer
the
evening
before
,
of
receiving
Miss
Matty
as
a
lodger
,
he
fairly
walked
away
from
me
to
the
window
,
and
began
drumming
with
his
fingers
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
turned
abruptly
round
,
and
said
,
"
See
,
Mary
,
how
a
good
,
innocent
life
makes
friends
all
around
.
 
<EOS>
Confound
it
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
make
a
good
lesson
out
of
it
if
I
were
a
parson
;
but
,
as
it
is
,
I
ca
n't
get
a
tail
to
my
sentences
 
<EOS>
only
I
'm
sure
you
feel
what
I
want
to
say
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
will
have
a
walk
after
lunch
and
talk
a
bit
more
about
these
plans
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
lunch
 
a
hot
savoury
mutton
-
chop
,
and
a
little
of
the
cold
loin
sliced
and
fried
 
was
now
brought
in
.
 
<EOS>
Every
morsel
of
this
last
dish
was
finished
,
to
Martha
's
great
gratification
.
 
<EOS>
Then
my
father
bluntly
told
Miss
Matty
he
wanted
to
talk
to
me
alone
,
and
that
he
would
stroll
out
and
see
some
of
the
old
places
,
and
then
I
could
tell
her
what
plan
we
thought
desirable
.
 
<EOS>
Just
before
we
went
out
,
she
called
me
back
and
said
,
"
Remember
,
dear
<EOS>
,
I
'm
the
only
one
left
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
there
's
no
one
to
be
hurt
by
what
I
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
willing
to
do
anything
that
's
right
and
honest
;
and
I
do
n't
think
,
if
Deborah
knows
where
she
is
,
she
'll
care
so
very
much
if
I
'm
not
genteel
;
because
,
you
see
,
she
'll
know
all
,
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Only
let
me
see
what
I
can
do
,
and
pay
the
poor
people
as
far
as
I
'm
able
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
gave
her
a
hearty
kiss
,
and
ran
after
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
The
result
of
our
conversation
was
this
.
 
<EOS>
If
all
parties
were
agreeable
,
Martha
and
Jem
were
to
be
married
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
,
and
they
were
to
live
on
in
Miss
Matty
's
present
abode
;
the
sum
which
the
Cranford
ladies
had
agreed
to
contribute
annually
being
sufficient
to
meet
the
greater
part
of
the
rent
,
and
leaving
Martha
free
to
appropriate
what
Miss
Matty
should
pay
for
her
lodgings
to
any
little
extra
comforts
required
.
 
<EOS>
About
the
sale
,
my
father
was
dubious
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
the
old
rectory
furniture
,
however
carefully
used
and
reverently
treated
,
would
fetch
very
little
;
and
that
little
would
be
but
as
a
drop
in
the
sea
of
the
debts
of
the
Town
and
County
Bank
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
I
represented
how
Miss
Matty
's
tender
conscience
would
be
soothed
by
feeling
that
she
had
done
what
she
could
,
he
gave
way
;
especially
after
I
had
told
him
the
five
-
pound
note
adventure
,
and
he
had
scolded
me
well
for
allowing
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
then
alluded
to
my
idea
that
she
might
add
to
her
small
income
by
selling
tea
;
and
,
to
my
surprise
(
for
I
had
nearly
given
up
the
plan
)
,
my
father
grasped
at
it
with
all
the
energy
of
a
tradesman
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
he
reckoned
his
chickens
before
they
were
hatched
,
for
he
immediately
ran
up
the
profits
of
the
sales
that
she
could
effect
in
Cranford
to
more
than
twenty
pounds
a
year
.
<EOS>
The
small
dining
-
parlour
was
to
be
converted
into
a
shop
,
without
any
of
its
degrading
characteristics
;
a
table
was
to
be
the
counter
;
one
window
was
to
be
retained
unaltered
,
and
the
other
changed
into
a
glass
door
.
 
<EOS>
I
evidently
rose
in
his
estimation
for
having
made
this
bright
suggestion
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
hoped
we
should
not
both
fall
in
Miss
Matty
's
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
was
patient
and
content
with
all
our
arrangements
.
 
<EOS>
She
knew
,
she
said
,
that
we
should
do
the
best
we
could
for
her
;
and
she
only
hoped
,
only
stipulated
,
that
she
should
pay
every
farthing
that
she
could
be
said
to
owe
,
for
her
father
's
sake
,
who
had
been
so
respected
in
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
and
I
had
agreed
to
say
as
little
as
possible
about
the
bank
,
indeed
never
to
mention
it
again
,
if
it
could
be
helped
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
plans
were
evidently
a
little
perplexing
to
her
;
but
she
had
seen
me
sufficiently
snubbed
in
the
morning
for
want
of
comprehension
to
venture
on
too
many
inquiries
now
;
and
all
passed
over
well
with
a
hope
on
her
part
that
no
one
would
be
hurried
into
marriage
on
her
account
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
came
to
the
proposal
that
she
should
sell
tea
,
I
could
see
it
was
rather
a
shock
to
her
;
not
on
account
of
any
personal
loss
of
gentility
involved
,
but
only
because
she
distrusted
her
own
powers
of
action
in
a
new
line
of
life
,
and
would
timidly
have
preferred
a
little
more
privation
to
any
exertion
for
which
she
feared
she
was
unfitted
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
when
she
saw
my
father
was
bent
upon
it
,
she
sighed
,
and
said
she
would
try
;
and
if
she
did
not
do
well
,
of
course
she
might
give
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
One
good
thing
about
it
was
,
she
did
not
think
men
ever
bought
tea
;
and
it
was
of
men
<EOS>
particularly
she
was
afraid
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
such
sharp
loud
ways
with
them
;
and
did
up
accounts
,
and
counted
their
change
so
quickly
!
 
<EOS>
Now
,
if
she
might
only
sell
comfits
to
children
,
she
was
sure
she
could
please
them
!
   
<EOS>
A
HAPPY
RETURN
 
<EOS>
Before
I
left
Miss
Matty
at
Cranford
everything
had
been
comfortably
arranged
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
Even
Mrs
Jamieson
's
approval
of
her
selling
tea
had
been
gained
.
 
<EOS>
That
oracle
had
taken
a
few
days
to
consider
whether
by
so
doing
Miss
Matty
would
forfeit
her
right
to
the
privileges
of
society
in
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
she
had
some
little
idea
of
mortifying
Lady
Glenmire
by
the
decision
she
gave
at
last
;
<EOS>
which
was
to
this
effect
:
 
that
whereas
a
married
woman
takes
her
husband
's
rank
by
the
strict
laws
of
precedence
,
an
unmarried
woman
retains
the
station
her
father
occupied
.
 
<EOS>
So
Cranford
was
allowed
to
visit
Miss
Matty
;
and
,
whether
allowed
or
not
,
it
intended
to
visit
Lady
Glenmire
.
  
<EOS>
But
what
was
our
surprise
 
<EOS>
our
dismay
 
<EOS>
when
we
learnt
that
Mr
and
MRS
HOGGINS
were
returning
on
the
following
Tuesday
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Hoggins
!
<EOS>
Had
she
absolutely
dropped
her
title
,
and
<EOS>
so
,
in
a
spirit
of
bravado
,
cut
the
aristocracy
to
become
a
Hoggins
!
 
<EOS>
She
,
who
might
have
been
called
Lady
Glenmire
to
her
dying
day
!
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
was
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
it
only
convinced
her
of
what
she
had
known
from
the
first
,
that
the
creature
had
a
low
taste
.
 
<EOS>
But
"
the
creature
"
looked
very
happy
on
Sunday
at
church
;
nor
did
we
see
it
necessary
to
keep
our
veils
down
on
that
side
of
our
bonnets
on
which
Mr
and
Mrs
Hoggins
sat
,
as
Mrs
Jamieson
did
;
thereby
missing
all
the
smiling
glory
of
his
face
,
and
all
the
becoming
blushes
of
hers
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
sure
if
Martha
and
Jem
looked
more
radiant
in
the
afternoon
,
when
they
,
too
,
made
their
first
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Jamieson
soothed
the
turbulence
of
her
soul
by
having
the
blinds
of
her
windows
drawn
down
,
as
if
for
a
funeral
,
on
the
day
when
Mr
and
Mrs
Hoggins
received
callers
;
and
it
was
with
some
difficulty
that
she
was
prevailed
upon
to
continue
the
St
James
's
Chronicle
,
<EOS>
so
indignant
was
she
with
its
having
inserted
the
announcement
of
the
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
's
sale
went
off
famously
.
 
<EOS>
She
retained
the
furniture
of
her
sitting
-
room
and
bedroom
;
the
former
of
which
she
was
to
occupy
till
Martha
could
meet
with
a
lodger
who
might
wish
to
take
it
;
and
into
this
sitting
-
room
and
bedroom
she
had
to
cram
all
sorts
of
things
,
which
were
(
the
auctioneer
assured
her
)
bought
in
for
her
at
the
sale
by
an
unknown
friend
.
 
<EOS>
I
always
suspected
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
of
this
;
but
she
must
have
had
an
accessory
,
who
knew
what
articles
were
particularly
regarded
by
Miss
Matty
on
account
of
their
associations
with
her
early
days
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
house
looked
rather
bare
,
to
be
sure
;
all
except
one
tiny
bedroom
,
of
which
my
father
allowed
me
to
purchase
the
furniture
for
my
occasional
use
in
case
of
Miss
Matty
's
illness
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
expended
my
own
small
store
in
buying
all
manner
of
comfits
and
lozenges
,
in
order
to
tempt
the
little
people
whom
Miss
Matty
loved
so
much
to
come
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
Tea
in
bright
green
canisters
,
and
comfits
in
tumblers
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
<EOS>
and
I
felt
quite
proud
as
we
looked
round
us
on
the
evening
before
the
shop
was
to
be
opened
.
<EOS>
Martha
had
scoured
the
boarded
floor
to
a
white
cleanness
,
and
it
was
adorned
with
a
brilliant
piece
of
oil
-
cloth
,
on
which
customers
were
to
stand
before
the
table
-
counter
.
 
<EOS>
The
wholesome
smell
of
plaster
and
whitewash
pervaded
the
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
A
very
small
"
Matilda
Jenkyns
,
licensed
to
sell
tea
,
"
was
hidden
under
the
lintel
of
the
new
door
,
and
two
boxes
of
tea
,
with
cabalistic
inscriptions
all
over
them
,
stood
ready
to
disgorge
their
contents
into
the
canisters
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
,
as
I
ought
to
have
mentioned
before
,
had
had
some
scruples
of
conscience
at
selling
tea
when
there
was
already
Mr
Johnson
in
the
town
,
who
included
it
among
his
numerous
commodities
;
and
,
before
she
could
quite
reconcile
herself
to
the
adoption
of
her
new
business
,
she
had
trotted
down
to
his
shop
,
unknown
to
me
,
to
tell
him
of
the
project
that
was
entertained
,
and
to
inquire
if
it
was
likely
to
injure
his
business
.
 
<EOS>
My
father
called
this
idea
of
hers
"
great
nonsense
,
"
and
"
wondered
how
tradespeople
were
to
get
on
if
there
was
to
be
a
continual
consulting
of
each
other
's
interests
,
which
would
put
a
stop
to
all
competition
directly
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
perhaps
,
it
would
not
have
done
in
Drumble
,
but
in
Cranford
it
answered
very
well
;
for
not
only
did
Mr
Johnson
kindly
put
at
rest
all
Miss
Matty
's
scruples
and
fear
of
injuring
his
business
,
but
I
have
reason
to
know
he
repeatedly
sent
customers
to
her
,
saying
that
the
teas
he
kept
were
of
a
common
kind
,
but
that
Miss
Jenkyns
had
all
the
choice
sorts
.
 
<EOS>
And
expensive
tea
is
a
very
favourite
luxury
with
well
-
to
-
do
tradespeople
and
rich
farmers
'
wives
,
who
turn
up
their
noses
at
the
Congou
and
Souchong
prevalent
at
many
tables
of
gentility
,
and
will
have
nothing
else
than
Gunpowder
and
Pekoe
for
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
return
to
Miss
Matty
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
really
very
pleasant
to
see
how
her
unselfishness
and
simple
sense
of
justice
called
out
the
same
good
qualities
in
others
.
 
<EOS>
She
never
seemed
to
think
any
one
would
impose
upon
her
,
because
she
should
be
so
grieved
to
do
it
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
heard
her
put
a
stop
to
the
asseverations
of
the
man
who
brought
her
coals
by
quietly
saying
,
"
I
am
sure
you
would
be
sorry
to
bring
me
wrong
weight
;
"
and
if
the
coals
were
short
measure
that
time
,
I
do
n't
believe
they
ever
were
again
.
 
<EOS>
People
would
have
felt
as
much
ashamed
of
presuming
on
her
good
faith
as
they
would
have
done
on
that
of
a
child
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
father
says
"
such
simplicity
might
be
very
well
in
Cranford
,
but
would
never
do
in
the
world
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
I
fancy
the
world
must
be
very
bad
,
for
with
all
my
father
's
suspicion
of
every
one
with
whom
he
has
dealings
,
and
<EOS>
in
spite
of
all
his
many
precautions
,
he
lost
upwards
of
a
thousand
pounds
by
roguery
only
last
year
.
  
<EOS>
I
just
stayed
long
enough
to
establish
Miss
Matty
in
her
new
mode
of
life
,
and
to
pack
up
the
library
,
which
the
rector
had
purchased
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
written
a
very
kind
letter
to
Miss
Matty
,
saying
"
how
glad
he
should
be
to
take
a
library
,
so
well
selected
as
he
knew
that
the
late
Mr
Jenkyns
's
must
have
been
,
at
any
valuation
put
upon
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
when
she
agreed
to
this
,
with
a
touch
of
sorrowful
gladness
that
they
would
go
back
to
the
rectory
and
be
arranged
on
the
accustomed
walls
once
more
,
he
sent
word
that
he
feared
that
he
had
not
room
for
them
all
,
and
perhaps
Miss
Matty
would
kindly
allow
him
to
leave
some
volumes
on
her
shelves
.
 
<EOS>
But
Miss
Matty
said
that
she
had
her
Bible
and
"
Johnson
's
Dictionary
,
"
and
should
not
have
much
time
for
reading
,
she
was
afraid
;
still
,
I
retained
a
few
books
out
of
consideration
for
the
rector
's
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
The
money
which
he
had
paid
,
and
that
produced
by
the
sale
,
was
partly
expended
in
the
stock
of
tea
,
and
part
of
it
was
invested
against
a
rainy
day
 
i.e.
old
age
or
illness
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
but
<EOS>
a
small
sum
,
it
is
true
;
and
it
occasioned
a
few
evasions
of
truth
and
white
lies
(
all
of
which
I
think
very
wrong
indeed
 
in
theory
 
and
would
rather
not
put
them
in
practice
)
,
for
we
knew
Miss
Matty
would
be
perplexed
as
to
her
duty
if
she
were
aware
of
any
little
reserve
 
fund
being
made
for
her
while
the
debts
of
the
bank
remained
unpaid
.
 
<EOS>
Moreover
,
she
had
never
been
told
of
the
way
in
which
her
friends
were
contributing
to
pay
the
rent
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
liked
to
tell
her
this
,
but
the
mystery
of
the
affair
gave
a
piquancy
to
their
deed
of
kindness
which
the
ladies
were
unwilling
to
give
up
;
and
at
first
Martha
had
to
shirk
many
a
perplexed
question
as
to
her
ways
and
means
of
living
in
such
a
house
,
but
by
-
and
-
by
Miss
Matty
's
prudent
uneasiness
sank
down
into
acquiescence
with
the
existing
arrangement
.
  
<EOS>
I
left
Miss
Matty
with
a
good
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Her
sales
of
tea
during
the
first
two
days
had
surpassed
my
most
sanguine
expectations
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
country
round
seemed
to
be
all
out
of
tea
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
alteration
I
could
have
desired
in
Miss
Matty
's
way
of
doing
business
was
,
that
she
should
not
have
so
plaintively
entreated
some
of
her
customers
not
to
buy
green
tea
 
<EOS>
running
it
down
as
a
slow
poison
,
sure
to
destroy
the
nerves
,
and
produce
all
manner
of
evil
.
 
<EOS>
Their
pertinacity
in
taking
it
,
in
spite
of
all
her
warnings
,
distressed
her
so
much
that
I
really
thought
she
would
relinquish
the
sale
of
it
,
and
so
lose
half
her
custom
;
and
I
was
driven
to
my
wits
'
end
for
instances
of
longevity
entirely
attributable
to
a
persevering
use
of
green
tea
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
final
argument
,
which
settled
the
question
,
was
a
happy
reference
of
mine
to
the
train
-
oil
and
tallow
candles
which
the
Esquimaux
not
only
enjoy
but
digest
.
 
<EOS>
After
that
she
acknowledged
that
"
one
man
's
meat
might
be
another
man
's
poison
,
"
and
contented
herself
thence
-
forward
with
an
occasional
remonstrance
when
she
thought
the
purchaser
was
too
young
and
innocent
to
be
acquainted
with
the
evil
effects
green
tea
produced
on
some
constitutions
,
and
an
habitual
sigh
when
people
old
enough
to
choose
more
wisely
would
prefer
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
went
over
from
Drumble
once
a
quarter
at
least
to
settle
the
accounts
,
and
see
after
the
necessary
business
letters
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
speaking
of
letters
,
I
began
to
be
very
much
ashamed
of
remembering
my
letter
to
the
Aga
Jenkyns
,
and
very
glad
I
had
never
named
my
writing
to
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
hoped
the
letter
was
lost
.
 
<EOS>
No
answer
came
.
 
<EOS>
No
sign
was
made
.
  
<EOS>
About
a
year
after
Miss
Matty
set
up
shop
,
I
received
one
of
Martha
's
hieroglyphics
,
begging
me
to
come
to
Cranford
very
soon
.
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
that
Miss
Matty
was
ill
,
and
went
off
that
very
afternoon
,
and
took
Martha
by
surprise
when
she
saw
me
on
opening
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
We
went
into
the
kitchen
as
usual
,
to
have
our
confidential
conference
,
and
then
Martha
told
me
she
was
expecting
her
confinement
very
soon
 
in
a
week
or
two
;
and
she
did
not
think
Miss
Matty
was
aware
of
it
,
and
she
wanted
me
to
break
the
news
to
her
,
"
for
indeed
,
miss
<EOS>
,
"
continued
Martha
,
crying
hysterically
,
"
I
'm
afraid
she
wo
n't
approve
of
it
,
and
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
know
who
is
to
take
care
of
her
as
she
should
be
taken
care
of
when
I
am
laid
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
comforted
Martha
by
telling
her
I
would
remain
till
she
was
about
again
,
and
only
wished
she
had
told
me
her
reason
for
this
sudden
summons
,
as
then
I
would
have
brought
the
requisite
stock
of
clothes
.
 
<EOS>
But
Martha
was
so
tearful
and
tender
-
spirited
,
and
unlike
her
usual
self
,
that
I
said
as
little
as
possible
about
myself
,
and
endeavoured
rather
to
comfort
Martha
under
all
the
probable
and
possible
misfortunes
which
came
crowding
upon
her
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
I
then
stole
out
of
the
house
-
door
,
and
made
my
appearance
as
if
I
were
a
customer
in
the
shop
,
just
to
take
Miss
Matty
by
surprise
,
and
gain
an
idea
of
how
she
looked
in
her
new
situation
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
warm
May
weather
,
so
only
the
little
half
-
door
was
closed
;
and
Miss
Matty
sat
behind
the
counter
,
knitting
an
elaborate
pair
of
garters
;
elaborate
they
seemed
to
me
,
but
the
difficult
stitch
was
no
weight
upon
her
mind
,
for
she
was
singing
in
a
low
voice
to
herself
as
her
needles
went
rapidly
in
and
out
.
 
<EOS>
I
call
it
singing
,
but
I
dare
say
a
musician
would
not
use
that
word
to
the
tuneless
yet
sweet
humming
of
the
low
worn
voice
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
out
from
the
words
,
far
more
than
from
the
attempt
at
the
tune
,
that
it
was
the
Old
Hundredth
she
was
crooning
to
herself
;
but
the
quiet
continuous
sound
told
of
content
,
and
gave
me
a
pleasant
feeling
,
as
I
stood
in
the
street
just
outside
the
door
,
quite
in
harmony
with
that
soft
May
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
went
in
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
she
did
not
catch
who
it
was
,
and
stood
up
as
if
to
serve
me
;
but
in
another
minute
watchful
pussy
had
clutched
her
knitting
,
which
was
dropped
in
eager
joy
at
seeing
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
found
,
after
we
had
had
a
little
conversation
,
that
it
was
as
Martha
said
,
and
that
Miss
Matty
had
no
idea
of
the
approaching
household
event
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
thought
I
would
let
things
take
their
course
,
<EOS>
secure
that
when
I
went
to
her
with
the
baby
in
my
arms
,
I
should
obtain
that
forgiveness
for
Martha
which
she
was
needlessly
frightening
herself
into
believing
that
Miss
Matty
would
withhold
,
under
some
notion
that
the
new
claimant
would
require
attentions
from
its
mother
that
it
would
be
faithless
treason
to
Miss
Matty
to
render
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
was
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
that
must
be
an
hereditary
quality
,
for
my
father
says
he
is
scarcely
ever
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
One
morning
,
within
a
week
after
I
arrived
,
I
went
to
call
Miss
Matty
,
with
a
little
bundle
of
flannel
in
my
arms
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
very
much
awe
-
struck
when
I
showed
her
what
it
was
,
and
asked
for
her
spectacles
off
the
dressing
-
table
,
and
looked
at
it
curiously
,
with
a
sort
of
tender
wonder
at
its
small
perfection
of
parts
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
banish
the
thought
of
the
surprise
all
day
,
but
went
about
on
tiptoe
,
and
was
very
silent
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
stole
up
to
see
Martha
<EOS>
and
they
both
cried
with
joy
,
and
she
got
into
a
complimentary
speech
to
Jem
,
and
did
not
know
how
to
get
out
of
it
again
,
and
was
only
extricated
from
her
dilemma
by
the
sound
of
the
shop
-
bell
,
which
was
an
equal
relief
to
the
shy
,
proud
,
honest
Jem
,
who
shook
my
hand
so
vigorously
when
I
congratulated
him
,
that
I
think
I
feel
the
pain
of
it
yet
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
a
busy
life
while
Martha
was
laid
up
.
 
<EOS>
I
attended
on
Miss
Matty
,
and
prepared
her
meals
;
I
cast
up
her
accounts
,
and
examined
into
the
state
of
her
canisters
and
tumblers
.
 
<EOS>
I
helped
her
,
too
,
occasionally
,
in
the
shop
;
and
it
gave
me
no
small
amusement
,
and
sometimes
a
little
uneasiness
,
to
watch
her
ways
there
.
 
<EOS>
If
a
little
child
came
in
to
ask
for
an
ounce
of
almond
-
comfits
(
and
four
of
the
large
kind
which
Miss
Matty
sold
weighed
that
much
)
,
she
always
added
one
more
by
"
way
of
make
-
weight
,
"
as
she
called
it
,
although
the
scale
was
handsomely
turned
before
;
and
when
I
remonstrated
against
this
,
her
reply
was
,
"
The
little
things
like
it
so
much
!
"
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
use
in
telling
her
that
the
fifth
comfit
weighed
a
quarter
of
an
ounce
,
and
made
every
sale
into
a
loss
to
her
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
remembered
the
green
tea
,
and
winged
my
shaft
with
a
feather
out
of
her
own
plumage
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
her
how
unwholesome
almond
-
comfits
were
,
and
how
ill
excess
in
them
might
make
the
little
children
.
 
<EOS>
This
argument
produced
some
effect
;
for
,
henceforward
,
instead
of
the
fifth
comfit
,
she
always
told
them
to
hold
out
their
tiny
palms
,
into
which
she
shook
either
peppermint
or
ginger
lozenges
,
as
a
preventive
to
the
dangers
that
might
arise
from
the
previous
sale
.
 
<EOS>
Altogether
the
lozenge
trade
,
conducted
on
these
principles
,
did
not
promise
to
be
remunerative
;
but
I
was
happy
to
find
she
had
made
more
than
twenty
pounds
during
the
last
year
by
her
sales
of
tea
;
and
,
moreover
,
that
now
she
was
accustomed
to
it
,
she
did
not
dislike
the
employment
,
which
brought
her
into
kindly
intercourse
with
many
of
the
people
round
about
.
<EOS>
If
she
gave
them
good
weight
,
they
,
in
their
turn
,
brought
many
a
little
country
present
to
the
"
old
rector
's
daughter
"
;
a
cream
cheese
,
a
few
new
-
laid
eggs
,
a
little
fresh
ripe
fruit
,
a
bunch
of
flowers
.
 
<EOS>
The
counter
was
quite
loaded
with
these
offerings
sometimes
,
as
she
told
me
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
Cranford
in
general
,
it
was
going
on
much
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
The
Jamieson
and
Hoggins
feud
still
raged
,
if
a
feud
it
could
be
called
,
when
only
one
side
cared
much
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Hoggins
were
very
happy
together
,
and
,
like
most
very
happy
people
,
quite
ready
to
be
friendly
;
indeed
,
Mrs
Hoggins
was
really
desirous
to
be
restored
to
Mrs
Jamieson
's
good
graces
,
because
of
the
former
intimacy
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mrs
Jamieson
considered
their
very
happiness
an
insult
to
the
Glenmire
family
,
to
which
she
had
still
the
honour
to
belong
,
and
she
doggedly
refused
and
rejected
every
advance
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Mulliner
,
like
a
faithful
clansman
,
espoused
his
mistress
'
side
with
ardour
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
saw
either
Mr
or
Mrs
Hoggins
,
he
would
cross
the
street
,
and
appear
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
life
in
general
,
and
his
own
path
in
particular
,
until
he
had
passed
them
by
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
used
to
amuse
herself
with
wondering
what
in
the
world
Mrs
Jamieson
would
do
,
if
either
she
,
or
Mr
Mulliner
,
or
any
other
member
of
her
household
was
taken
ill
;
she
could
hardly
have
the
face
to
call
in
Mr
Hoggins
after
the
way
she
had
behaved
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
grew
quite
impatient
for
some
indisposition
or
accident
to
befall
Mrs
Jamieson
or
her
dependents
,
in
order
that
Cranford
might
see
how
she
would
act
under
the
perplexing
circumstances
.
  
<EOS>
Martha
was
beginning
to
go
about
again
,
and
I
had
already
fixed
a
limit
,
not
very
far
distant
,
to
my
visit
,
when
one
afternoon
,
as
I
was
sitting
in
the
shop
-
parlour
with
Miss
Matty
 
<EOS>
I
remember
the
weather
was
colder
now
than
it
had
been
in
May
,
three
weeks
before
,
and
we
had
a
fire
and
kept
the
door
fully
closed
 
<EOS>
we
saw
a
gentleman
go
slowly
past
the
window
,
and
then
stand
opposite
to
the
door
,
as
if
looking
out
for
the
name
which
we
had
so
carefully
hidden
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
out
a
double
eyeglass
and
peered
about
for
some
time
before
he
could
discover
it
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
came
in
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
all
on
a
sudden
,
it
flashed
across
me
that
it
was
the
Aga
himself
!
 
<EOS>
For
his
clothes
had
an
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
foreign
cut
about
them
,
and
his
face
was
deep
brown
,
as
if
tanned
and
re
-
tanned
by
the
sun
.
 
<EOS>
His
complexion
contrasted
oddly
with
his
plentiful
snow
-
white
hair
,
his
eyes
were
dark
and
piercing
,
and
he
had
an
odd
way
of
contracting
them
and
puckering
up
his
cheeks
into
innumerable
wrinkles
when
he
looked
earnestly
at
objects
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
so
to
Miss
Matty
when
he
first
came
in
.
 
<EOS>
His
glance
had
first
caught
and
lingered
a
little
upon
me
,
but
then
turned
,
with
the
peculiar
searching
look
I
have
described
,
to
Miss
Matty
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
a
little
fluttered
and
nervous
,
but
no
more
so
than
she
always
was
when
any
man
came
into
her
shop
.
<EOS>
She
thought
that
he
would
probably
have
a
note
,
or
a
sovereign
at
least
,
for
which
she
would
have
to
give
change
,
which
was
an
operation
she
very
much
disliked
to
perform
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
present
customer
stood
opposite
to
her
,
without
asking
for
anything
,
only
looking
fixedly
at
her
as
he
drummed
upon
the
table
with
his
fingers
,
just
for
all
the
world
as
Miss
Jenkyns
used
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
was
on
the
point
of
asking
him
what
he
wanted
(
as
she
told
me
afterwards
)
,
when
he
turned
sharp
to
me
:
 
<EOS>
"
Is
your
name
Mary
Smith
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
!
"
said
I.
  
<EOS>
All
my
doubts
as
to
his
identity
were
set
at
rest
,
and
I
only
wondered
what
he
would
say
or
do
next
,
and
how
Miss
Matty
would
stand
the
joyful
shock
of
what
he
had
to
reveal
.
 
<EOS>
Apparently
he
was
at
a
loss
how
to
announce
himself
,
for
he
looked
round
at
last
in
search
of
something
to
buy
,
so
as
to
gain
time
,
and
,
as
it
happened
,
his
eye
caught
on
the
almond
-
comfits
,
and
he
boldly
asked
for
a
pound
of
"
those
things
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
if
Miss
Matty
had
a
whole
pound
in
the
shop
,
and
,
besides
the
unusual
magnitude
of
the
order
,
she
was
distressed
with
the
idea
of
the
indigestion
they
would
produce
,
taken
in
such
unlimited
quantities
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
up
to
remonstrate
.
 
<EOS>
Something
of
tender
relaxation
in
his
face
struck
home
to
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
,
"
It
is
 
oh
,
sir
!
<EOS>
can
you
be
Peter
?
"
and
trembled
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
moment
he
was
round
the
table
and
had
her
in
his
arms
,
sobbing
the
tearless
cries
of
old
age
.
 
<EOS>
I
brought
her
a
glass
of
wine
,
for
indeed
her
colour
had
changed
so
as
to
alarm
me
and
Mr
Peter
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
kept
saying
,
"
I
have
been
too
sudden
for
you
,
Matty
 
<EOS>
I
have
,
my
little
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
proposed
that
she
should
go
at
once
up
into
the
drawing
-
room
and
lie
down
on
the
sofa
there
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
wistfully
at
her
brother
,
whose
hand
she
had
held
tight
,
even
when
nearly
fainting
;
but
on
his
assuring
her
that
he
would
not
leave
her
,
she
allowed
him
to
carry
her
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
I
thought
that
the
best
I
could
do
was
to
run
and
put
the
kettle
on
the
fire
for
early
tea
,
and
then
to
attend
to
the
shop
,
leaving
the
brother
and
sister
to
exchange
some
of
the
many
thousand
things
they
must
have
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
also
to
break
the
news
to
Martha
,
who
received
it
with
a
burst
of
tears
which
nearly
infected
me
.
 
<EOS>
She
kept
recovering
herself
to
ask
if
I
was
sure
it
was
indeed
Miss
Matty
's
brother
,
<EOS>
for
I
had
mentioned
that
he
had
grey
hair
,
and
she
had
always
heard
that
he
was
a
very
handsome
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
Something
of
the
same
kind
perplexed
Miss
Matty
at
tea
-
time
,
when
she
was
installed
in
the
great
easy
-
chair
opposite
to
Mr
Jenkyns
in
order
to
gaze
her
fill
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
hardly
drink
for
looking
at
him
,
and
as
for
eating
,
that
was
out
of
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
hot
climates
age
people
very
quickly
,
"
said
she
,
almost
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
you
left
Cranford
you
had
not
a
grey
hair
in
your
head
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
how
many
years
ago
is
that
?
"
said
Mr
Peter
,
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
true
!
<EOS>
yes
,
I
suppose
you
and
I
are
getting
old
.
 
<EOS>
But
still
I
did
not
think
we
were
so
very
old
!
 
<EOS>
But
white
hair
is
very
becoming
to
you
,
Peter
<EOS>
,
"
she
continued
 
a
little
afraid
lest
she
had
hurt
him
by
revealing
how
his
appearance
had
impressed
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
forgot
dates
too
,
Matty
,
for
what
do
you
think
I
have
brought
for
you
from
India
?
 
<EOS>
I
have
an
Indian
muslin
gown
and
a
pearl
necklace
for
you
somewhere
in
my
chest
at
Portsmouth
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
smiled
as
if
amused
at
the
idea
of
the
incongruity
of
his
presents
with
the
appearance
of
his
sister
;
but
this
did
not
strike
her
all
at
once
,
while
the
elegance
of
the
articles
did
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
see
that
for
a
moment
her
imagination
dwelt
complacently
on
the
idea
of
herself
thus
attired
;
and
instinctively
she
put
her
hand
up
to
her
throat
 
<EOS>
that
little
delicate
throat
which
(
as
Miss
Pole
had
told
me
)
had
been
one
of
her
youthful
charms
;
but
the
hand
met
the
touch
of
folds
of
soft
muslin
in
which
she
was
always
swathed
up
to
her
chin
,
and
the
sensation
recalled
a
sense
of
the
unsuitableness
of
a
pearl
necklace
to
her
age
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
,
"
I
'm
afraid
I
'm
too
old
;
but
it
was
very
kind
of
you
to
think
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
just
what
I
should
have
liked
years
ago
 
when
I
was
young
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
thought
,
my
little
Matty
.
 
<EOS>
I
remembered
your
tastes
;
they
were
so
like
my
dear
mother
's
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
the
mention
of
that
name
<EOS>
the
brother
and
sister
clasped
each
other
's
hands
yet
more
fondly
,
and
,
although
they
were
perfectly
silent
,
I
fancied
they
might
have
something
to
say
if
they
were
unchecked
by
my
presence
,
and
I
got
up
to
arrange
my
room
for
Mr
Peter
's
occupation
that
night
,
intending
myself
to
share
Miss
Matty
's
bed
.
 
<EOS>
But
at
my
movement
,
he
started
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
and
settle
about
a
room
at
the
"
George
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
carpet
-
bag
is
there
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Miss
Matty
,
in
great
distress
 
"
you
must
not
go
;
please
,
dear
Peter
 
pray
,
Mary
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
you
must
not
go
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
so
much
agitated
that
we
both
promised
everything
she
wished
.
 
<EOS>
Peter
sat
down
again
and
gave
her
his
hand
,
which
for
better
security
she
held
in
both
of
hers
,
and
I
left
the
room
to
accomplish
my
arrangements
.
  
<EOS>
Long
,
long
into
the
night
,
far
,
far
into
the
morning
,
did
Miss
Matty
and
I
talk
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
much
to
tell
me
of
her
brother
's
life
and
adventures
,
which
he
had
communicated
to
her
as
they
had
sat
alone
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
all
was
thoroughly
clear
to
her
;
but
I
never
quite
understood
the
whole
story
;
and
when
in
after
days
I
lost
my
awe
of
Mr
Peter
enough
to
question
him
myself
,
he
laughed
at
my
curiosity
,
and
told
me
stories
that
sounded
so
very
much
like
Baron
Munchausen
's
,
that
I
was
sure
he
was
making
fun
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
heard
from
Miss
Matty
was
that
he
had
been
a
volunteer
at
the
siege
of
Rangoon
;
had
been
taken
prisoner
by
the
Burmese
;
and
somehow
obtained
favour
and
eventual
freedom
from
knowing
how
to
bleed
the
chief
of
the
small
tribe
in
some
case
of
dangerous
illness
;
that
on
his
release
from
years
of
captivity
he
had
had
his
letters
returned
from
England
with
the
ominous
word
"
Dead
"
marked
upon
them
;
and
,
believing
himself
to
be
the
last
of
his
race
,
he
had
settled
down
as
an
indigo
planter
,
and
had
proposed
to
spend
the
remainder
of
his
life
in
the
country
to
whose
inhabitants
and
modes
of
life
he
had
become
habituated
,
when
my
letter
had
reached
him
;
and
,
with
the
odd
vehemence
which
characterised
him
in
age
as
it
had
done
in
youth
,
he
had
sold
his
land
and
all
his
possessions
to
the
first
purchaser
,
and
come
home
to
the
poor
old
sister
,
who
was
more
glad
and
rich
than
any
princess
when
she
looked
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
talked
me
to
sleep
at
last
,
and
then
I
was
awakened
by
a
slight
sound
at
the
door
,
for
which
she
begged
my
pardon
as
she
crept
penitently
into
bed
;
but
it
seems
that
when
I
could
no
longer
confirm
her
belief
that
the
long
-
lost
was
really
here
 
under
the
same
roof
 
she
had
begun
to
fear
lest
it
was
only
a
waking
dream
of
hers
;
that
there
never
had
been
a
Peter
sitting
by
her
all
that
blessed
evening
 
<EOS>
but
that
the
real
Peter
lay
dead
far
away
beneath
some
wild
sea
-
wave
,
or
under
some
strange
eastern
tree
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
strong
had
this
nervous
feeling
of
hers
become
,
that
she
was
fain
to
get
up
and
go
and
convince
herself
that
he
was
really
there
by
listening
through
the
door
to
his
even
,
regular
breathing
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
to
call
it
snoring
,
but
I
heard
it
myself
through
two
closed
doors
 
and
by-
and
-
by
it
soothed
Miss
Matty
to
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
Mr
Peter
came
home
from
India
as
rich
as
a
nabob
;
he
even
considered
himself
poor
,
but
neither
he
nor
Miss
Matty
cared
much
about
that
.
 
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
he
had
enough
to
live
upon
"
very
genteelly
"
at
Cranford
;
he
and
Miss
Matty
together
.
 
<EOS>
And
a
day
or
two
after
his
arrival
,
the
shop
was
closed
,
while
troops
of
little
urchins
gleefully
awaited
the
shower
of
comfits
and
lozenges
that
came
from
time
to
time
down
upon
their
faces
as
they
stood
up
-
gazing
at
Miss
Matty
's
drawing
-
room
windows
.
 
<EOS>
Occasionally
Miss
Matty
would
say
to
them
(
half
-
hidden
behind
the
curtains
)
,
"
My
dear
children
,
do
n't
make
yourselves
ill
;
"
but
a
strong
arm
pulled
her
back
,
and
a
more
rattling
shower
than
ever
succeeded
.
 
<EOS>
A
part
of
the
tea
was
sent
in
presents
to
the
Cranford
ladies
;
and
some
of
it
was
distributed
among
the
old
people
who
remembered
Mr
Peter
in
the
days
of
his
frolicsome
youth
.
 
<EOS>
The
Indian
muslin
gown
was
reserved
for
darling
Flora
Gordon
<EOS>
(
Miss
Jessie
Brown
's
daughter
)
.
 
<EOS>
The
Gordons
had
been
on
the
Continent
for
the
last
few
years
,
but
were
now
expected
to
return
very
soon
;
and
Miss
Matty
,
in
her
sisterly
pride
,
anticipated
great
delight
in
the
joy
of
showing
them
Mr
Peter
.
 
<EOS>
The
pearl
necklace
disappeared
;
and
about
that
time
many
handsome
and
useful
presents
made
their
appearance
in
the
households
of
Miss
Pole
and
Mrs
Forrester
;
and
some
rare
and
delicate
Indian
ornaments
graced
the
drawing
-
rooms
of
Mrs
Jamieson
and
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
.
 
<EOS>
I
myself
was
not
forgotten
.
 
<EOS>
Among
other
things
,
I
had
the
handsomest
-
bound
and
best
edition
of
Dr
Johnson
's
works
that
could
be
procured
;
and
dear
Miss
Matty
,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
,
begged
me
to
consider
it
as
a
present
from
her
sister
as
well
as
herself
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
no
one
was
forgotten
;
and
,
what
was
more
,
every
one
,
however
insignificant
,
who
had
shown
kindness
to
Miss
Matty
at
any
time
,
was
sure
of
Mr
Peter
's
cordial
regard
.
   
<EOS>
PEACE
TO
CRANFORD
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
surprising
that
Mr
Peter
became
such
a
favourite
at
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
The
ladies
vied
with
each
other
who
should
admire
him
most
;
and
no
wonder
,
for
their
quiet
lives
were
astonishingly
stirred
up
by
the
arrival
from
India
 
especially
as
the
person
arrived
told
more
wonderful
stories
than
Sindbad
the
Sailor
;
and
,
as
Miss
Pole
said
,
was
quite
as
good
as
an
Arabian
Night
any
evening
.
 
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
had
vibrated
all
my
life
between
Drumble
and
Cranford
,
and
I
thought
it
was
quite
possible
that
all
Mr
Peter
's
stories
might
be
true
,
although
wonderful
;
but
when
I
found
that
,
if
we
swallowed
an
anecdote
of
tolerable
magnitude
one
week
,
we
had
the
dose
considerably
increased
the
next
,
I
began
to
have
my
doubts
;
especially
as
I
noticed
that
when
his
sister
was
present
the
accounts
of
Indian
life
were
comparatively
tame
;
not
that
she
knew
more
than
we
did
,
perhaps
less
.
 
<EOS>
I
noticed
also
that
when
the
rector
came
to
call
,
Mr
Peter
talked
in
a
different
way
about
the
countries
he
had
been
in
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
think
the
ladies
in
Cranford
would
have
considered
him
such
a
wonderful
traveller
if
they
had
only
heard
him
talk
in
the
quiet
way
he
did
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
liked
him
the
better
,
indeed
,
for
being
what
they
called
"
so
very
Oriental
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
One
day
,
at
a
select
party
in
his
honour
,
which
Miss
Pole
gave
,
and
from
which
,
as
Mrs
Jamieson
honoured
it
with
her
presence
,
and
had
even
offered
to
send
Mr
Mulliner
to
wait
,
Mr
and
Mrs
Hoggins
and
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
were
necessarily
 
excluded
one
day
at
Miss
Pole
's
,
Mr
Peter
said
he
was
tired
of
sitting
upright
against
the
hard
-
backed
uneasy
chairs
,
and
asked
if
he
might
not
indulge
himself
in
sitting
cross
-
legged
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
's
consent
was
eagerly
given
,
and
down
he
went
with
the
utmost
gravity
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
Miss
Pole
asked
me
,
in
an
audible
whisper
,
"
if
he
did
not
remind
me
of
the
Father
of
the
Faithful
?
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
help
thinking
of
poor
Simon
Jones
,
the
lame
tailor
,
and
while
Mrs
Jamieson
slowly
commented
on
the
elegance
and
convenience
of
the
attitude
,
I
remembered
how
we
had
all
followed
that
lady
's
lead
in
condemning
Mr
Hoggins
for
vulgarity
because
he
simply
crossed
his
legs
as
he
sat
still
on
his
chair
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
Mr
Peter
's
ways
of
eating
were
a
little
strange
amongst
such
ladies
as
Miss
Pole
,
and
Miss
Matty
,
and
Mrs
Jamieson
,
especially
when
I
recollected
the
untasted
green
peas
and
two
-
pronged
forks
at
poor
Mr
Holbrook
's
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
The
mention
of
that
gentleman
's
name
recalls
to
my
mind
a
conversation
between
Mr
Peter
and
Miss
Matty
one
evening
in
the
summer
after
he
returned
to
Cranford
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
had
been
very
hot
,
and
Miss
Matty
had
been
much
oppressed
by
the
weather
,
in
the
heat
of
which
her
brother
revelled
.
 
<EOS>
I
remember
that
she
had
been
unable
to
nurse
Martha
's
baby
,
which
had
become
her
favourite
employment
of
late
,
and
which
was
as
much
at
home
in
her
arms
as
in
its
mother
's
,
as
long
as
it
remained
a
light
-
weight
,
portable
by
one
so
fragile
as
Miss
Matty
.
 
<EOS>
This
day
to
which
I
refer
,
Miss
Matty
had
seemed
more
than
usually
feeble
and
languid
,
and
only
revived
when
the
sun
went
down
,
and
her
sofa
was
wheeled
to
the
open
window
,
through
which
,
although
it
looked
into
the
principal
street
of
Cranford
,
the
fragrant
smell
of
the
neighbouring
hayfields
came
in
every
now
and
then
,
borne
by
the
soft
breezes
that
stirred
the
dull
air
of
the
summer
twilight
,
and
then
died
away
.
 
<EOS>
The
silence
of
the
sultry
atmosphere
was
lost
in
the
murmuring
noises
which
came
in
from
many
an
open
window
and
door
;
even
the
children
were
abroad
in
the
street
,
late
as
it
was
(
between
ten
and
eleven
)
,
enjoying
the
game
of
play
for
which
they
had
not
had
spirits
during
the
heat
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
source
of
satisfaction
to
Miss
Matty
to
see
how
few
candles
were
lighted
,
even
in
the
apartments
of
those
houses
from
which
issued
the
greatest
signs
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peter
,
Miss
Matty
,
and
<EOS>
I
had
all
been
quiet
,
each
with
a
separate
reverie
,
for
some
little
time
,
when
Mr
Peter
broke
in
     
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
little
Matty
,
I
could
have
sworn
you
were
on
the
high
road
to
matrimony
when
I
left
England
that
last
time
!
 
<EOS>
If
anybody
had
told
me
you
would
have
lived
and
died
an
old
maid
then
,
I
should
have
laughed
in
their
faces
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Matty
made
no
reply
,
and
I
tried
in
vain
to
think
of
some
subject
which
should
effectually
turn
the
conversation
;
but
I
was
very
stupid
;
and
before
I
spoke
he
went
on
     
<EOS>
"
It
was
Holbrook
,
that
fine
manly
fellow
who
lived
at
Woodley
,
that
I
used
to
think
would
carry
off
my
little
Matty
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
not
think
it
now
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
Mary
;
but
this
sister
of
mine
was
once
a
very
pretty
girl
 
<EOS>
at
least
,
I
thought
so
,
and
so
I
've
a
notion
did
poor
Holbrook
.
 
<EOS>
What
business
had
he
to
die
before
I
came
home
to
thank
him
for
all
his
kindness
to
a
good
-
for
-
nothing
cub
as
I
was
?
<EOS>
It
was
that
that
made
me
first
think
he
cared
for
you
;
for
in
all
our
fishing
expeditions
it
was
Matty
,
Matty
<EOS>
,
we
talked
about
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Deborah
!
 
<EOS>
What
a
lecture
she
read
me
on
having
asked
him
home
to
lunch
one
day
,
when
she
had
seen
the
Arley
carriage
in
the
town
,
and
thought
that
my
lady
might
call
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
that
's
long
years
ago
;
more
than
half
a
life
-
time
,
and
yet
it
seems
like
yesterday
!
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
a
fellow
I
should
have
liked
better
as
a
brother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
played
your
cards
badly
,
my
little
Matty
,
somehow
or
another
 
wanted
your
brother
to
be
a
good
go
-
between
,
eh
,
little
one
?
"
<EOS>
said
he
,
putting
out
his
hand
to
take
hold
of
hers
as
she
lay
on
the
sofa
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
's
this
?
<EOS>
you
're
shivering
and
shaking
,
Matty
,
with
that
confounded
open
window
.
 
<EOS>
Shut
it
,
Mary
,
this
minute
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
did
so
,
and
then
stooped
down
to
kiss
Miss
Matty
,
and
see
if
she
really
were
chilled
.
 
<EOS>
She
caught
at
my
hand
,
and
gave
it
a
hard
squeeze
 
but
unconsciously
<EOS>
,
I
think
 
for
in
a
minute
or
two
she
spoke
to
us
quite
in
her
usual
voice
,
and
smiled
our
uneasiness
away
,
although
she
patiently
submitted
to
the
prescriptions
we
enforced
of
a
warm
bed
and
a
glass
of
weak
negus
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
to
leave
Cranford
the
next
day
,
and
before
I
went
<EOS>
I
saw
that
all
the
effects
of
the
open
window
had
quite
vanished
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
superintended
most
of
the
alterations
necessary
in
the
house
and
household
during
the
latter
weeks
of
my
stay
.
 
<EOS>
The
shop
was
once
more
a
parlour
:
 
the
empty
resounding
rooms
again
furnished
up
to
the
very
garrets
.
  
<EOS>
There
had
been
some
talk
of
establishing
Martha
and
Jem
in
another
house
,
but
Miss
Matty
would
not
hear
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
never
saw
her
so
much
roused
as
when
Miss
Pole
had
assumed
it
to
be
the
most
desirable
arrangement
.
 
<EOS>
As
long
as
Martha
would
remain
with
Miss
Matty
,
Miss
Matty
was
only
too
thankful
to
have
her
about
her
;
yes
,
and
Jem
too
,
who
was
a
very
pleasant
man
to
have
in
the
house
,
for
she
never
saw
him
from
week
's
end
to
week
's
end
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
for
the
probable
children
,
if
they
would
all
turn
out
such
little
darlings
as
her
god
-
daughter
,
Matilda
<EOS>
,
she
should
not
mind
the
number
,
if
Martha
did
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
next
was
to
be
called
Deborah
 
a
point
which
Miss
Matty
had
reluctantly
yielded
to
Martha
's
stubborn
determination
that
her
first
-
born
was
to
be
Matilda
.
 
<EOS>
So
Miss
Pole
had
to
lower
her
colours
,
and
even
her
voice
,
as
she
said
to
me
that
,
as
Mr
and
Mrs
Hearn
were
still
to
go
on
living
in
the
same
house
with
Miss
Matty
,
we
had
certainly
done
a
wise
thing
in
hiring
Martha
's
niece
as
an
auxiliary
.
  
<EOS>
I
left
Miss
Matty
and
Mr
Peter
most
comfortable
and
contented
;
the
only
subject
for
regret
to
the
tender
heart
of
the
one
,
and
the
social
friendly
nature
of
the
other
,
being
the
unfortunate
quarrel
between
Mrs
Jamieson
and
the
plebeian
Hogginses
and
their
following
.
 
<EOS>
In
joke
,
I
prophesied
one
day
that
this
would
only
last
until
Mrs
Jamieson
or
Mr
Mulliner
were
ill
,
in
which
case
they
would
only
be
too
glad
to
be
friends
with
Mr
Hoggins
;
but
Miss
Matty
did
not
like
my
looking
forward
to
anything
like
illness
in
so
light
a
manner
,
and
before
the
year
was
out
all
had
come
round
in
a
far
more
satisfactory
way
.
  
<EOS>
I
received
two
Cranford
letters
on
one
auspicious
October
morning
.
<EOS>
Both
Miss
Pole
and
Miss
Matty
wrote
to
ask
me
to
come
over
and
meet
the
Gordons
,
who
had
returned
to
England
alive
and
well
with
their
two
children
,
now
almost
grown
up
.
 
<EOS>
Dear
Jessie
Brown
had
kept
her
old
kind
nature
,
although
she
had
changed
her
name
and
station
;
and
she
wrote
to
say
that
she
and
Major
Gordon
expected
to
be
in
Cranford
on
the
fourteenth
,
and
she
hoped
and
begged
to
be
remembered
to
Mrs
Jamieson
(
named
first
,
as
became
her
honourable
station
)
,
Miss
Pole
and
Miss
Matty
 
could
she
ever
forget
their
kindness
to
her
poor
father
and
sister
?
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Forrester
,
Mr
Hoggins
(
and
here
again
came
in
an
allusion
to
kindness
shown
to
the
dead
long
ago
)
,
his
new
wife
,
who
as
such
must
allow
Mrs
Gordon
to
desire
to
make
her
acquaintance
,
and
who
was
,
moreover
,
an
old
Scotch
friend
of
her
husband
's
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
every
one
was
named
,
from
the
rector
 
who
had
been
appointed
to
Cranford
in
the
interim
between
Captain
Brown
's
death
and
Miss
Jessie
's
marriage
,
and
was
now
associated
with
the
latter
event
 
down
to
Miss
Betty
Barker
.
<EOS>
All
were
asked
to
the
luncheon
;
all
except
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
,
who
had
come
to
live
in
Cranford
since
Miss
Jessie
Brown
's
days
,
and
whom
I
found
rather
moping
on
account
of
the
omission
.
 
<EOS>
People
wondered
at
Miss
Betty
Barker
's
being
included
in
the
honourable
list
;
but
,
then
,
as
Miss
Pole
said
,
we
must
remember
the
disregard
of
the
genteel
proprieties
of
life
in
which
the
poor
captain
had
educated
his
girls
,
and
for
his
sake
we
swallowed
our
pride
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Mrs
Jamieson
rather
took
it
as
a
compliment
,
as
putting
Miss
Betty
(
formerly
HER
maid
)
on
a
level
with
"
those
Hogginses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
when
I
arrived
in
Cranford
,
nothing
was
as
yet
ascertained
of
Mrs
Jamieson
's
own
intentions
;
would
the
honourable
lady
go
,
or
would
she
not
?
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peter
declared
that
she
should
and
she
would
;
Miss
Pole
shook
her
head
and
desponded
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Peter
was
a
man
of
resources
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
he
persuaded
Miss
Matty
to
write
to
Mrs
Gordon
,
and
to
tell
her
of
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
's
existence
,
and
to
beg
that
one
so
kind
,
and
cordial
,
and
generous
,
might
be
included
in
the
pleasant
invitation
.
 
<EOS>
An
answer
came
back
by
return
of
post
,
with
a
pretty
little
note
for
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
,
and
a
request
that
Miss
Matty
would
deliver
it
herself
and
explain
the
previous
omission
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Fitz
-
Adam
was
as
pleased
as
could
be
,
and
thanked
Miss
Matty
over
and
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peter
had
said
,
"
Leave
Mrs
Jamieson
to
me
;
"
so
we
did
;
especially
as
we
knew
nothing
that
we
could
do
to
alter
her
determination
if
once
formed
.
  
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
,
nor
did
Miss
Matty
<EOS>
,
how
things
were
going
on
,
until
Miss
Pole
asked
me
,
just
the
day
before
Mrs
Gordon
came
,
if
I
thought
there
was
anything
between
Mr
Peter
and
Mrs
Jamieson
in
the
matrimonial
line
,
for
that
Mrs
Jamieson
was
really
going
to
the
lunch
at
the
"
George
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
had
sent
Mr
Mulliner
down
to
desire
that
there
might
be
a
footstool
put
to
the
warmest
seat
in
the
room
,
as
she
meant
to
come
,
and
knew
that
their
chairs
were
very
high
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
had
picked
this
piece
of
news
up
,
and
from
it
she
conjectured
all
sorts
of
things
,
and
bemoaned
yet
more
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
Peter
should
marry
,
what
would
become
of
poor
dear
Miss
Matty
?
 
<EOS>
And
Mrs
Jamieson
,
of
all
people
!
"
 
<EOS>
Miss
Pole
seemed
to
think
there
were
other
ladies
in
Cranford
who
would
have
done
more
credit
to
his
choice
,
and
I
think
she
must
have
had
someone
who
was
unmarried
in
her
head
,
for
she
kept
saying
,
"
It
was
so
wanting
in
delicacy
in
a
widow
to
think
of
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
I
got
back
to
Miss
Matty
's
I
really
did
begin
to
think
that
Mr
Peter
might
be
thinking
of
Mrs
Jamieson
for
a
wife
,
and
I
was
as
unhappy
as
Miss
Pole
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
the
proof
sheet
of
a
great
placard
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Signor
Brunoni
,
Magician
to
the
King
of
Delhi
,
the
Rajah
of
Oude
,
and
the
great
Lama
of
Thibet
,
"
&
c.
&
c.
,
was
going
to
"
perform
in
Cranford
for
one
night
only
,
"
the
very
next
night
;
and
Miss
Matty
,
exultant
,
showed
me
a
letter
from
the
Gordons
,
promising
to
remain
over
this
gaiety
,
which
Miss
Matty
said
was
entirely
Peter
's
doing
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
written
to
ask
the
signor
to
come
,
and
was
to
be
at
all
the
expenses
of
the
affair
.
 
<EOS>
Tickets
were
to
be
sent
gratis
to
as
many
as
the
room
would
hold
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
Miss
Matty
was
charmed
with
the
plan
,
and
said
that
to
-
morrow
Cranford
would
remind
her
of
the
Preston
Guild
,
to
which
she
had
been
in
her
youth
 
<EOS>
a
luncheon
at
the
"
George
,
"
with
the
dear
Gordons
,
and
the
signor
in
the
Assembly
Room
in
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
 
I
looked
only
at
the
fatal
words
:
    
"
<EOS>
UNDER
THE
PATRONAGE
OF
THE
HONOURABLE
MRS
JAMIESON
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
,
then
,
was
chosen
to
preside
over
this
entertainment
of
Mr
Peter
's
;
she
was
perhaps
going
to
displace
my
dear
Miss
Matty
in
his
heart
,
and
make
her
life
lonely
once
more
!
 
<EOS>
I
could
not
look
forward
to
the
morrow
with
any
pleasure
;
and
every
innocent
anticipation
of
Miss
Matty
's
only
served
to
add
to
my
annoyance
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
angry
and
irritated
,
and
exaggerating
every
little
incident
which
could
add
to
my
irritation
,
I
went
on
till
we
were
all
assembled
in
the
great
parlour
at
the
"
George
.
"
 
<EOS>
Major
and
Mrs
Gordon
and
pretty
Flora
and
Mr
Ludovic
were
all
as
bright
and
handsome
and
friendly
as
could
be
;
but
I
could
hardly
attend
to
them
for
watching
Mr
Peter
,
and
I
saw
that
Miss
Pole
was
equally
busy
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
never
seen
Mrs
Jamieson
so
roused
and
animated
before
;
her
face
looked
full
of
interest
in
what
Mr
Peter
was
saying
.
 
<EOS>
I
drew
near
to
listen
.
 
<EOS>
My
relief
was
great
when
I
caught
that
his
words
were
not
words
of
love
,
but
that
,
for
all
his
grave
face
,
he
was
at
his
old
tricks
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
telling
her
of
his
travels
in
India
,
and
describing
the
wonderful
height
of
the
Himalaya
mountains
:
 
one
touch
after
another
added
to
their
size
,
and
each
exceeded
the
former
in
absurdity
;
but
Mrs
Jamieson
really
enjoyed
all
in
perfect
good
faith
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
required
strong
stimulants
to
excite
her
to
come
out
of
her
apathy
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Peter
wound
up
his
account
by
saying
that
,
of
course
,
at
that
altitude
there
were
none
of
the
animals
to
be
found
that
existed
in
the
lower
regions
;
the
game
,
 
everything
was
different
.
 
<EOS>
Firing
one
day
at
some
flying
creature
,
he
was
very
much
dismayed
when
it
fell
,
to
find
that
he
had
shot
a
cherubim
!
<EOS>
Mr
Peter
caught
my
eye
at
this
moment
,
and
gave
me
such
a
funny
twinkle
,
that
I
felt
sure
he
had
no
thoughts
of
Mrs
Jamieson
as
a
wife
from
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
She
looked
uncomfortably
amazed
     
<EOS>
"
But
,
Mr
Peter
,
shooting
a
cherubim
 
do
n't
you
think
 
I
am
afraid
that
was
sacrilege
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Peter
composed
his
countenance
in
a
moment
,
and
appeared
shocked
at
the
idea
,
which
,
as
he
said
truly
enough
,
was
now
presented
to
him
for
the
first
time
;
but
then
Mrs
Jamieson
must
remember
that
he
had
been
living
for
a
long
time
among
savages
 
all
of
whom
were
heathens
 
some
of
them
,
he
was
afraid
,
were
downright
Dissenters
.
<EOS>
Then
,
seeing
Miss
Matty
draw
near
,
he
hastily
changed
the
conversation
,
and
after
a
little
while
,
turning
to
me
,
he
said
,
"
Do
n't
be
shocked
,
prim
little
Mary
,
at
all
my
wonderful
stories
.
<EOS>
I
consider
Mrs
Jamieson
fair
game
,
and
besides
I
am
bent
on
propitiating
her
,
and
the
first
step
towards
it
is
keeping
her
well
awake
.
 
<EOS>
I
bribed
her
here
by
asking
her
to
let
me
have
her
name
as
patroness
for
my
poor
conjuror
this
evening
;
and
I
do
n't
want
to
give
her
time
enough
to
get
up
her
rancour
against
the
Hogginses
,
who
are
just
coming
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
everybody
to
be
friends
,
for
it
harasses
Matty
so
much
to
hear
of
these
quarrels

<EOS>
I
shall
go
at
it
again
by
-
and
-
by
,
so
you
need
not
look
shocked

I
intend
to
enter
the
Assembly
Room
to
-
night
with
Mrs
Jamieson
on
one
side
,
and
my
lady
,
Mrs
Hoggins
,
on
the
other

Somehow
or
another
he
did
;
and
fairly
got
them
into
conversation
together

Major
and
Mrs
Gordon
helped
at
the
good
work
with
their
perfect
ignorance
of
any
existing
coolness
between
any
of
the
inhabitants
of
Cranford
.
  
<EOS>
Ever
since
that
day
there
has
been
the
old
friendly
sociability
in
Cranford
society
;
which
I
am
thankful
for
,
because
of
my
dear
Miss
Matty
's
love
of
peace
and
kindliness
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
love
Miss
Matty
,
and
I
somehow
think
we
are
all
of
us
better
when
she
is
near
us
.
