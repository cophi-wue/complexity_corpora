I.The
Three
Cranes
in
the
Vintry
.
<EOS>
Adjoining
the
Vintry
Wharf
,
and
at
the
corner
of
a
narrow
lane
communicating
with
Thames
Street
,
there
stood
,
in
the
early
part
of
the
Seventeenth
Century
,
a
tavern
called
the
Three
Cranes
.
<EOS>
This
old
and
renowned
place
of
entertainment
had
then
been
in
existence
more
than
two
hundred
years
,
though
under
other
designations
.
<EOS>
In
the
reign
of
Richard
II
.
,
when
it
was
first
established
,
it
was
styled
the
Painted
Tavern
,
from
the
circumstance
of
its
outer
walls
being
fancifully
coloured
and
adorned
with
Bacchanalian
devices
.
<EOS>
But
these
decorations
went
out
of
fashion
in
time
,
and
the
tavern
,
somewhat
changing
its
external
features
,
though
preserving
all
its
internal
comforts
and
accommodation
,
assumed
the
name
of
the
Three
Crowns
,
under
which
title
it
continued
until
the
accession
of
Elizabeth
,
when
it
became
(
by
a
slight
modification
)
<EOS>
the
Three
Cranes
;
and
so
remained
in
the
days
of
her
successor
,
and
,
indeed
,
long
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Not
that
the
last
-
adopted
denomination
had
any
reference
,
as
might
be
supposed
,
to
the
three
huge
wooden
instruments
on
the
wharf
,
employed
with
ropes
and
pulleys
to
unload
the
lighters
and
other
vessels
that
brought
up
butts
and
hogsheads
of
wine
from
the
larger
craft
below
Bridge
,
and
constantly
thronged
the
banks
;
though
,
no
doubt
,
they
indirectly
suggested
it
.
<EOS>
The
Three
Cranes
depicted
on
the
large
signboard
,
suspended
in
front
of
the
tavern
,
were
long
-
necked
,
long
-
beaked
birds
,
each
with
a
golden
fish
in
its
bill
.
<EOS>
But
under
whatever
designation
it
might
be
known
—
Crown
or
Crane
—
the
tavern
had
always
maintained
a
high
reputation
for
excellence
of
wine
:
and
this
is
the
less
surprising
when
we
take
into
account
its
close
proximity
to
the
vast
vaults
and
cellars
of
the
Vintry
,
where
the
choicest
produce
of
Gascony
,
Bordeaux
,
and
other
wine
-
growing
districts
,
was
deposited
;
some
of
which
we
may
reasonably
conclude
would
find
its
way
to
its
tables
.
<EOS>
Good
wine
,
it
may
be
incidentally
remarked
,
was
cheap
enough
when
the
Three
Cranes
was
first
opened
,
the
delicate
juice
of
the
Gascoign
grape
being
then
vended
,
at
fourpence
the
gallon
,
and
Rhenish
at
sixpence
!
<EOS>
Prices
,
however
,
had
risen
considerably
at
the
period
of
which
we
propose
to
treat
;
but
the
tavern
was
as
well
-
reputed
and
well
-
frequented
as
ever
:
even
more
so
,
for
it
had
considerably
advanced
in
estimation
since
it
came
into
the
hands
of
a
certain
enterprising
French
skipper
,
Prosper
Bonaventure
by
name
,
who
intrusted
its
management
to
his
active
and
pretty
little
wife
Dameris
,
while
he
himself
prosecuted
his
trading
voyages
between
the
Garonne
and
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
And
very
well
Madame
Bonaventure
fulfilled
the
duties
of
hostess
,
as
will
be
seen
.
<EOS>
Now
,
as
the
skipper
was
a
very
sharp
fellow
,
and
perfectly
understood
his
business
-
practically
anticipating
the
Transatlantic
axiom
of
buying
at
the
cheapest
market
and
gelling
at
the
dearest
-
he
soon
contrived
to
grow
rich
.
<EOS>
He
did
more
:
he
pleased
his
customers
at
the
Three
Cranes
.
<EOS>
Taking
care
to
select
his
wines
judiciously
,
and
having
good
opportunities
,
he
managed
to
obtain
possession
of
some
delicious
vintages
,
which
,
could
not
be
matched
elsewhere
;
and
,
with
this
nectar
at
his
command
,
the
fortune
of
his
house
was
made
.
<EOS>
All
the
town
gallants
flocked
to
the
Three
Cranes
to
dine
at
the
admirable
French
ordinary
newly
established
there
,
and
crush
a
flask
or
so
of
the
exquisite
Bordeaux
,
about
which
,
and
its
delicate
flavour
and
bouquet
,
all
the
connoisseurs
in
claret
were
raving
.
<EOS>
From
,
mid
-
day
,
therefore
,
till
late
in
the
afternoon
,
there
were
nearly
as
many
gay
barges
and
wherries
as
lighters
lying
off
the
Vintry
Wharf
;
and
sometimes
,
when
accommodation
was
wanting
,
the
little
craft
were
moored
along
the
shore
all
the
way
from
Queenhithe
to
the
Steelyard
;
at
which
latter
place
the
Catherine
Wheel
was
almost
as
much
noted
for
racy
Rhenish
and
high
-
dried
neat
's
tongues
,
as
our
tavern
was
for
fine
Bordeaux
and
well
-
seasoned
pâtés
.
<EOS>
Not
the
least
,
however
,
of
the
attractions
of
the
Three
Cranes
,
was
the
hostess
herself
.
<EOS>
A
lively
little
brunette
was
Madame
Bonaventure
,
still
young
,
or
,
at
all
events
,
very
far
from
being
old
;
with
extremely
fine
teeth
,
which
she
was
fond
of
displaying
,
and
a
remarkably
neat
ancle
,
which
she
felt
no
inclination
to
hide
beneath
the
sweep
of
her
round
circling
farthingale
.
<EOS>
Her
figure
was
quite
that
of
a
miniature
Venus
;
and
as
,
like
most
of
her
country
<EOS>
-
women
,
she
understood
the
art
of
dress
to
admiration
,
she
set
off
her
person
to
the
best
advantage
;
always
attiring
herself
in
a
style
,
and
in
colours
,
that
suited
her
,
and
never
indulging
in
an
unwarrantable
extravagance
of
ruff
,
or
absurd
and
unbecoming
length
of
peaked
boddice
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
stuffs
she
wore
,
they
were
certainly
above
her
station
,
for
no
Court
dame
could
boast
of
richer
silks
than
those
in
which
the
pretty
Dameris
appeared
on
fête
days
;
and
this
was
accounted
for
by
reason
that
the
good
skipper
seldom
returned
from
a
trip
to
France
without
bringing
his
wife
a
piece
of
silk
,
brocade
,
or
velvet
from
Lyons
;
or
some
little
matter
from
Paris
,
such
as
a
ruff
,
cuff
,
partlet
,
bandlet
,
or
fillet
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
last
French
mode
might
be
seen
at
the
Three
Crowns
,
displayed
by
the
hostess
,
as
well
as
the
last
French
entremet
at
its
table
;
since
,
among
other
important
accessories
to
the
well
-
doing
of
the
house
,
Madame
Bonaventure
kept
a
chef
de
cuisine
—
one
of
her
compatriots
—
of
such
superlative
skill
,
that
in
later
times
he
must
infallibly
have
been
distinguished
as
a
cordon
bleu
.
<EOS>
But
not
having
yet
completed
our
description
of
the
charming
Bordelaise
we
must
add
that
she
possessed
a
rich
southern
complexion
,
fine
sparkling
black
eyes
,
shaded
by
long
dark
eye
-
lashes
,
and
over
-
arched
by
jetty
brows
,
and
that
her
raven
hair
was
combed
back
and
gathered
in
a
large
roll
over
her
smooth
forehead
,
which
had
the
five
points
of
beauty
complete
.
<EOS>
Over
this
she
wore
a
prettily
-
conceived
coif
,
with
a
frontlet
.
<EOS>
A
well
-
starched
,
well
-
plaited
ruff
encompossed
her
throat
.
<EOS>
Her
upper
lip
was
darkened
,
but
in
the
slightest
degree
,
by
down
like
the
softest
silk
;
and
this
peculiarity
(
a
peculiarity
it
would
be
in
an
Englishwoman
,
though
frequently
observable
in
the
beauties
of
the
South
of
France
)
lent
additional
piquancy
and
zest
to
her
charms
in
the
eyes
of
her
numerous
adorers
.
<EOS>
Her
ankles
we
have
said
were
trim
;
and
it
may
be
added
that
they
were
oftener
displayed
in
an
embroidered
French
velvet
shoe
than
in
one
of
Spanish
leather
;
while
in
walking
out
she
increased
her
stature
"
by
the
altitude
of
a
chopine
.
<EOS>
"Captain
<EOS>
Bonaventure
was
by
no
means
jealous
;
and
even
if
he
had
been
,
it
would
have
mattered
little
,
since
he
was
so
constantly
away
.
<EOS>
Fancying
,
therefore
,
she
had
some
of
the
privileges
of
a
widow
,
our
lively
Dameris
flirted
a
good
deal
with
the
gayest
and
handsomest
of
the
galliards
frequenting
her
house
.
<EOS>
But
she
knew
where
to
stop
;
no
licence
or
indecorum
was
ever
permitted
at
the
Three
Cranes
;
and
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
in
favour
of
the
hostess
,
when
the
dissolute
character
of
the
age
is
taken
into
consideration
.
<EOS>
Besides
this
,
Cyprien
,
a
stout
well
-
favoured
young
Gascon
,
who
filled
the
posts
of
drawer
and
chamberlain
,
together
with
two
or
three
other
trencher
-
scrapers
,
who
served
at
table
,
and
waited
on
the
guests
,
were
generally
sufficient
to
clear
the
house
of
any
troublesome
roysterers
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
reputation
of
the
Three
Cranes
was
unblemished
,
in
spite
of
the
liveliness
and
coquetry
of
its
mistress
;
and
in
spite
,
also
,
of
the
malicious
tongues
of
rival
tavern
-
keepers
,
which
were
loud
against
it
.
<EOS>
A
pretty
woman
is
sure
to
have
enemies
and
calumniators
,
and
Madame
Bonaventure
had
more
than
enow
;
but
she
thought
very
little
about
them
.
<EOS>
There
was
one
point
,
however
,
on
which
it
behoved
her
to
be
careful
:
and
extremely
careful
she
was,—not
leaving
a
single
loop
-
hole
for
censure
or
attack
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
question
of
religion
.
<EOS>
On
first
taking
the
house
,
Madame
Bonaventure
gave
it
out
that
she
and
the
skipper
were
Huguenots
,
descended
from
families
who
had
suffered
much
persecution
during
the
time
of
the
League
,
for
staunch
adherence
to
their
faith
;
and
the
statement
was
generally
credited
,
though
there
were
some
who
professed
to
doubt
it
.
<EOS>
Certain
it
was
,
our
hostess
did
not
wear
any
cross
,
beads
,
or
other
outward
symbol
of
Papacy
.
<EOS>
And
though
this
might
count
for
little
,
it
was
never
discovered
that
she
attended
mass
in
secret
.
<EOS>
Her
movements
were
watched
,
but
without
anything
coming
to
light
that
had
reference
to
religious
observances
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
Those
who
tried
to
trace
her
,
found
that
her
visits
were
mostly
paid
to
Paris
Garden
,
the
Rose
,
and
the
Globe
(
where
our
immortal
bard
's
plays
were
then
being
performed
)
,
or
some
other
place
of
amusement
;
and
if
she
did
go
on
the
river
at
times
,
it
was
merely
upon
a
party
of
pleasure
,
accompanied
by
gay
gallants
in
velvet
cloaks
and
silken
doublets
,
and
by
light
-
hearted
dames
like
herself
,
and
not
by
notorious
plotters
or
sour
priests
.
<EOS>
Still
,
as
many
Bordeaux
merchants
frequented
the
house
,
as
well
as
traders
from
the
Hanse
towns
,
and
other
foreigners
,
it
was
looked
upon
by
the
suspicious
as
a
hotbed
of
Romish
heresy
and
treason
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
these
maligners
affirmed
that
English
recusants
,
as
well
as
seminary
priests
from
abroad
,
had
been
harboured
there
,
and
clandestinely
spirited
away
from
the
pursuit
of
justice
by
the
skipper
;
but
the
charges
were
never
substantiated
,
and
could
,
therefore
,
only
proceed
from
envy
and
malice
.
<EOS>
Whatever
Madame
Bonaventure
's
religious
opinions
might
be
,
she
kept
her
own
council
so
well
that
no
one
ever
found
them
out
.
<EOS>
But
evil
days
were
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
all
had
been
smiling
and
prosperous
.
<EOS>
The
prospect
now
began
to
darken
.
<EOS>
Within
the
last
twelve
months
a
strange
and
unlooked
for
interference
had
taken
place
with
our
hostess
's
profits
,
which
she
had
viewed
,
at
first
,
without
much
anxiety
,
because
she
did
not
clearly
comprehend
its
scope
;
but
latterly
,
as
its
formidable
character
became
revealed
,
it
began
to
fill
her
with
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
The
calamity
,
as
she
naturally
enough
regarded
it
,
arose
in
the
following
manner
.
<EOS>
The
present
was
an
age
of
monopolies
and
patents
,
granted
by
a
crown
ever
eager
to
obtain
money
under
any
pretext
,
however
unjustifiable
and
iniquitous
,
provided
it
was
plausibly
coloured
;
and
these
vexatious
privileges
were
purchased
by
greedy
and
unscrupulous
persons
for
the
purpose
of
turning
them
into
instruments
of
extortion
and
wrong
.
<EOS>
Though
various
branches
of
trade
and
industry
groaned
under
the
oppression
inflicted
upon
them
,
there
were
no
means
of
redress
.
<EOS>
The
patentees
enjoyed
perfect
immunity
,
grinding
them
down
as
they
pleased
,
farming
out
whole
districts
,
and
dividing
the
spoil
.
<EOS>
Their
miserable
victims
dared
scarcely
murmur
;
having
ever
the
terrible
court
of
Star
-
Chamber
before
them
,
which
their
persecutors
could
command
,
and
which
punished
libellers
—
as
they
would
be
accounted
,
if
they
gave
utterance
to
their
wrongs
,
and
charged
their
oppressors
with
mis
-
doing,—with
fine
,
branding
,
and
the
pillory
.
<EOS>
Many
were
handled
in
this
sort
,
and
held
up
in
terrorem
to
the
others
.
<EOS>
Hence
it
came
to
pass
,
that
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
from
the
fearful
nature
of
its
machinery
;
its
extraordinary
powers
;
the
notorious
corruption
and
venality
of
its
officers
;
the
peculiarity
of
its
practice
,
which
always
favoured
the
plaintiff
;
and
the
severity
with
which
it
punished
any
libelling
or
slanderous
words
uttered
against
the
king
's
representative
(
as
the
patentees
were
considered
)
,
or
any
conspiracy
or
false
accusation
brought
against
them
;
it
came
to
pass
,
we
say
,
that
this
terrible
court
became
as
much
dreaded
in
Protestant
England
as
the
Inquisition
in
Catholic
Spain
.
<EOS>
The
punishments
inflicted
by
the
Star
-
Chamber
were
,
as
we
learn
from
a
legal
authority
,
and
a
counsel
in
the
court
,
"
fine
,
imprisonment
,
loss
of
ears
,
or
nailing
to
the
pillory
,
slitting
the
nose
,
branding
the
forehead
,
whipping
of
late
days
,
wearing
of
papers
in
public
places
,
or
any
punishment
but
death
.
"
<EOS>
And
John
Chamberlain
,
Esq
.
,
writing
to
Sir
Dudley
Carlton
,
about
the
same
period
,
observes
,
that
"
The
world
is
now
much
terrified
with
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
there
being
not
so
little
an
offence
against
any
proclamation
,
but
is
liable
and
subject
to
the
censure
of
that
court
.
<EOS>
And
for
proclamations
and
patents
,
they
are
become
so
ordinary
that
there
is
no
end
;
every
day
bringing
forth
some
new
project
or
other
.
<EOS>
As
,
within
these
two
days
,
here
is
one
come
forth
for
tobacco
,
wholly
engrossed
by
Sir
Thomas
Roe
and
his
partners
,
which
,
if
they
can
keep
and
maintain
against
the
general
clamour
,
will
be
a
great
commodity
;
unless
,
peradventure
,
indignation
,
rather
than
all
other
reasons
,
may
bring
that
filthy
weed
out
of
use
.
"
<EOS>
[
What
,
would
be
the
effect
of
such
a
patent
now
-
a
-
days
?
<EOS>
Would
it
,
at
all
,
restrict
the
use
of
the
"
filthy
weed
?
"
]
<EOS>
"
In
truth
,
"
proceeds
Chamberlain
,
"
the
world
doth
even
groan
under
the
burthen
of
these
perpetual
patents
,
which
are
become
so
frequent
,
that
whereas
at
the
king
's
coming
in
there
were
complaints
of
some
eight
or
nine
monopolies
then
in
being
<EOS>
,
they
are
now
said
to
be
multiplied
to
as
many
scores
.
<EOS>
"From
the
foregoing
citation
,
from
a
private
letter
of
the
time
,
the
state
of
public
feeling
may
be
gathered
,
and
the
alarm
occasioned
in
all
classes
by
these
oppressions
perfectly
understood
.
<EOS>
Amongst
those
who
had
obtained
the
largest
share
of
spoil
were
two
persons
destined
to
occupy
a
prominent
position
in
our
history
.
<EOS>
They
were
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
and
Sir
Francis
<EOS>
Mitchell,—both
names
held
in
general
dread
and
detestation
,
though
no
man
ventured
to
speak
ill
of
them
openly
,
since
they
were
as
implacable
in
their
animosities
,
as
usurious
and
griping
in
their
demands
;
and
many
an
ear
had
been
lost
,
many
a
nose
slit
,
many
a
back
scourged
at
the
cart
's
tail
,
because
the
unfortunate
owners
had
stigmatized
them
according
to
their
deserts
.
<EOS>
Thus
they
enjoyed
a
complete
immunity
of
wrong
;
and
,
with
the
terrible
court
of
Star
-
Chamber
to
defend
them
and
to
punish
their
enemies
,
they
set
all
opposition
at
defiance
.
<EOS>
Insatiable
as
unscrupulous
,
this
avaricious
pair
were
ever
on
the
alert
to
devise
new
means
of
exaction
and
plunder
,
and
amongst
the
latest
and
most
productive
of
their
inventions
were
three
patents
,
which
they
had
obtained
through
the
instrumentality
of
Sir
Edward
Villiers
(
half
-
brother
of
the
ruling
favourite
,
the
Marquess
of
Buckingham)—and
for
due
consideration
-
money
,
of
course,—for
the
licensing
of
ale
-
houses
the
inspection
of
inns
and
hostelries
,
and
the
exclusive
manufacture
of
gold
and
silver
thread
.
<EOS>
It
is
with
the
two
former
of
these
that
we
have
now
to
deal
;
inasmuch
as
it
was
their
mischievous
operation
that
affected
Madame
Bonaventure
so
prejudicially
;
and
this
we
shall
more
fully
explain
,
as
it
will
serve
to
show
the
working
of
a
frightful
system
of
extortion
and
injustice
happily
no
longer
in
existence
.
<EOS>
By
the
sweeping
powers
conferred
upon
them
by
their
patents
,
the
whole
of
the
inns
of
the
metropolis
were
brought
under
the
control
of
the
two
extortioners
,
who
levied
such
imposts
as
they
pleased
.
<EOS>
The
withdrawal
of
a
license
,
or
the
total
suppression
of
a
tavern
,
on
the
plea
of
its
being
a
riotous
and
disorderly
house
,
immediately
followed
the
refusal
of
any
demand
,
however
excessive
;
and
most
persons
preferred
the
remote
possibility
of
ruin
,
with
the
chance
of
averting
it
by
ready
submission
,
to
the
positive
certainty
of
losing
both
substance
and
liberty
by
resistance
.
<EOS>
Fearful
was
the
havoc
occasioned
by
these
licensed
depredators
,
yet
no
one
dared
to
check
them
—
no
one
ventured
to
repine
.
<EOS>
They
had
the
name
of
law
to
justify
their
proceedings
,
and
all
its
authority
to
uphold
them
.
<EOS>
Compromises
were
attempted
in
some
instances
,
but
they
were
found
unavailing
.
<EOS>
Easily
evaded
by
persons
who
never
intended
to
be
bound
by
them
,
they
only
added
keenness
to
the
original
provocation
,
without
offering
a
remedy
for
it
.
<EOS>
The
two
bloodsuckers
,
it
was
clear
,
would
not
desist
from
draining
the
life
-
current
from
the
veins
of
their
victims
while
a
drop
remained
.
<EOS>
And
they
were
well
served
in
their
iniquitous
task,—for
the
plain
reason
that
they
paid
their
agents
,
well
.
<EOS>
Partners
<EOS>
they
had
none
;
none
,
at
least
,
who
cared
to
acknowledge
themselves
as
such
.
<EOS>
But
the
subordinate
officers
of
the
law
(
and
indeed
some
high
in
office
,
it
was
hinted
)
,
the
sheriff
's
followers
,
bailiffs
,
tipstaves
,
and
others
,
were
all
in
their
pay
;
besides
a
host
of
myrmidons,—base
,
sordid
knaves
,
who
scrupled
not
at
false
-
swearing
,
cozenage
,
or
any
sort
of
rascality
,
even
forgery
of
legal
documents
,
if
required
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
poor
Madame
Bonaventure
,
finding
she
had
got
into
the
clutches
of
these
harpies
,
began
to
tremble
for
the
result
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
II.Sir
Giles
Mompesson
and
His
Partner
.
<EOS>
Madame
Bonaventure
had
already
paid
considerable
sums
to
the
two
extortioners
,
but
she
resisted
their
last
application
;
in
consequence
of
which
she
received
a
monition
from
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
,
to
the
effect
that
,
in
a
month
's
time
,
her
license
would
be
withdrawn
,
and
her
house
shut
up
,
unless
,
in
the
interim
,
she
consented
to
make
amends
to
himself
and
his
co
-
patentee
,
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
,
by
payment
of
the
sum
in
question
,
together
with
a
further
sum
,
equal
to
it
in
amount
,
by
way
of
forfeit
;
thus
doubling
the
original
demand
.
<EOS>
Our
pretty
hostess
,
it
would
seem
,
had
placed
herself
in
an
awkward
predicament
by
her
temerity
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
was
not
a
man
to
threaten
idly
,
as
all
who
had
incurred
his
displeasure
experienced
to
their
cost
.
<EOS>
His
plan
was
to
make
himself
feared
;
and
he
was
inexorable
,
as
fate
itself
,
to
a
creditor
.
<EOS>
He
ever
exacted
the
full
penalty
of
his
bond
.
<EOS>
In
this
instance
,
according
to
his
own
notion
,
he
had
acted
with
great
leniency
;
and
certainly
,
judged
by
his
customary
mode
of
proceeding
in
such
cases
,
he
had
shown
some
little
indulgence
.
<EOS>
In
this
line
of
conduct
he
had
been
mainly
influenced
by
his
partner
,
who
,
not
being
insensible
to
the
attractions
of
the
fair
hostess
,
hoped
to
win
her
favour
by
a
show
of
consideration
.
<EOS>
But
though
Madame
Bonaventure
was
willing
enough
,
for
her
own
purposes
,
to
encourage
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
's
attentions
<EOS>
(
she
detested
him
in
her
secret
heart
)
,
she
by
no
means
relied
upon
him
for
security
.
<EOS>
A
more
powerful
friend
was
held
in
reserve
,
whom
she
meant
to
produce
at
the
last
moment
;
and
,
consequently
,
she
was
not
so
ill
at
ease
as
she
otherwise
would
have
been
,
though
by
no
means
free
from
misgiving
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
was
a
terrible
enemy
,
and
seldom
thwarted
in
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
That
she
knew
.
<EOS>
But
no
man
was
more
keenly
alive
to
his
own
interest
than
he
;
and
she
persuaded
herself
he
would
find
it
to
his
advantage
not
to
molest
her
:
in
which
case
she
was
safe
.
<EOS>
Of
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
she
had
less
apprehension
;
for
,
though
equally
mischievous
and
malevolent
with
his
partner
,
he
was
far
feebler
of
purpose
,
and
for
the
most
part
governed
by
him
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
she
felt
she
had
the
amorous
knight
in
her
toils
,
and
could
easily
manage
him
if
he
were
alone
.
<EOS>
So
the
case
stood
with
respect
to
our
pretty
hostess
;
but
,
before
proceeding
further
,
it
may
be
well
to
give
a
more
complete
description
of
the
two
birds
of
prey
by
whom
she
was
threatened
with
beak
and
talon
.
<EOS>
The
master
-
spirit
of
the
twain
was
undoubtedly
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
Quick
in
conception
of
villainy
,
he
was
equally
daring
in
execution
.
<EOS>
How
he
had
risen
to
his
present
bad
eminence
no
one
precisely
knew
;
because
,
with
the
craft
and
subtlety
that
distinguished
him
,
he
laid
his
schemes
so
deeply
,
and
covered
his
proceedings
with
so
thick
a
veil
,
that
they
had
been
rarely
detected
.
<EOS>
Report
,
however
,
spoke
of
him
as
a
usurer
of
the
vilest
kind
,
who
wrung
exorbitant
interest
from
needy
borrowers,—who
advanced
money
to
expectant
heirs
,
with
the
intention
of
plundering
them
of
their
inheritance,—and
who
resorted
to
every
trick
and
malpractice
permitted
by
the
law
to
benefit
himself
at
his
neighbour
's
expense
.
<EOS>
These
were
bad
enough
,
but
even
graver
accusations
were
made
against
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
whispered
that
he
had
obtained
fraudulent
possession
of
deeds
and
family
papers
,
which
had
enabled
him
to
wrest
estates
from
their
rightful
owners
;
and
some
did
not
scruple
to
add
to
these
charges
that
he
had
forged
documents
to
carry
out
his
nefarious
designs
.
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
,
from
comparative
poverty
he
speedily
rose
to
wealth
;
and
,
as
his
means
increased
,
so
his
avaricious
schemes
were
multiplied
and
extended
.
<EOS>
His
earlier
days
were
passed
in
complete
obscurity
,
none
but
the
neediest
spendthrift
or
the
most
desperate
gambler
knowing
where
he
dwelt
,
and
every
one
who
found
him
out
in
his
wretched
abode
near
the
Marshalsea
had
reason
to
regret
his
visit
.
<EOS>
Now
he
was
well
enough
known
by
many
a
courtly
prodigal
,
and
his
large
mansion
near
Fleet
Bridge
(
it
was
said
of
him
that
he
always
chose
the
neigbourhood
of
a
prison
for
his
dwelling
)
was
resorted
to
by
the
town
gallants
whose
,
necessities
or
extravagance
compelled
them
to
obtain
supplies
at
exorbitant
interest
.
<EOS>
Lavish
in
his
expenditure
on
occasions
,
Sir
Giles
was
habitually
so
greedy
and
penurious
,
that
he
begrudged
every
tester
he
expended
.
<EOS>
He
wished
to
keep
up
a
show
of
hospitality
without
cost
,
and
secretly
pleased
himself
by
thinking
that
he
made
his
guests
pay
for
his
entertainments
,
and
even
for
his
establishment
.
<EOS>
His
servants
complained
of
being
half
-
starved
,
though
he
was
constantly
at
war
with
them
for
their
wastefulness
and
riot
.
<EOS>
He
made
,
however
,
a
great
display
of
attendants
,
inasmuch
as
he
had
a
whole
retinue
of
myrmidons
at
his
beck
and
call
;
and
these
,
as
before
observed
,
were
well
paid
.
<EOS>
They
were
the
crows
that
followed
the
vultures
,
and
picked
the
bones
of
the
spoil
when
their
ravening
masters
had
been
fully
glutted
.
<EOS>
In
the
court
of
Star
-
Chamber
,
as
already
remarked
,
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
found
an
instrument
in
every
way
fitted
to
his
purposes
;
and
he
worked
it
with
terrible
effect
,
as
will
be
shown
hereafter
.
<EOS>
With
him
it
was
at
once
a
weapon
to
destroy
,
and
a
shield
to
protect
.
<EOS>
This
court
claimed
"
a
superlative
power
not
only
to
take
causes
from
other
courts
and
punish
them
there
,
but
also
to
punish
offences
secondarily
,
when
other
courts
have
punished
them
.
"
<EOS>
Taking
advantage
of
this
privilege
,
when
a
suit
was
commenced
against
him
elsewhere
,
Sir
Giles
contrived
to
remove
it
to
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
where
,
being
omnipotent
with
clerks
and
counsel
,
he
was
sure
of
success,—the
complaints
being
so
warily
contrived
,
the
examinations
so
adroitly
framed
,
and
the
interrogatories
so
numerous
and
perplexing
,
that
the
defendant
,
or
delinquent
,
as
he
was
indifferently
styled
,
was
certain
to
be
baffled
and
defeated
.
<EOS>
"
The
sentences
of
this
court
,
"
it
has
been
said
by
one
intimately
acquainted
with
its
practice
,
and
very
favourably
inclined
to
it
,
"
strike
to
the
root
of
men
's
reputations
,
and
many
times
of
their
estates
;
"
and
,
again
,
it
was
a
rule
with
it
,
that
the
prosecutor
"
was
ever
intended
to
be
favoured
.
"
<EOS>
Knowing
this
as
well
as
the
high
legal
authority
from
whom
we
have
quoted
,
Sir
Giles
ever
placed
himself
in
the
favoured
position
,
and
,
with
the
aid
of
this
iniquitous
tribunal
,
blasted
many
a
fair
reputation
,
and
consigned
many
a
victim
of
its
injustice
to
the
Fleet
,
there
to
rot
till
he
paid
him
the
utmost
of
his
demands
,
or
paid
the
debt
of
nature
.
<EOS>
In
an
age
less
corrupt
and
venal
than
that
under
consideration
,
such
a
career
could
not
have
long
continued
without
check
.
<EOS>
But
in
the
time
of
James
the
First
,
from
the
neediness
of
the
monarch
himself
,
and
the
rapacity
of
his
minions
and
courtiers
and
their
satellites,—each
striving
to
enrich
himself
,
no
matter
how
—
a
thousand
abuses
,
both
of
right
and
justice
,
were
tolerated
or
connived
at
,
crime
stalking
abroad
unpunished
.
<EOS>
The
Star
-
Chamber
itself
served
the
king
as
,
in
a
less
degree
,
it
served
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
,
and
others
of
the
same
stamp
,
as
a
means
of
increasing
his
revenue
;
half
the
fines
mulcted
from
those
who
incurred
its
censure
or
its
punishments
being
awarded
to
the
crown
.
<EOS>
Thus
nice
inquiries
were
rarely
made
,
unless
a
public
example
was
needed
,
when
the
wrongdoer
was
compelled
to
disgorge
his
plunder
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
never
done
till
the
pear
was
fully
ripe
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
,
however
,
had
no
apprehensions
of
any
such
result
in
his
case
.
<EOS>
Like
a
sly
fox
,
or
rather
like
a
crafty
wolf
,
he
was
too
confident
in
his
own
cunning
and
resources
to
fear
being
caught
in
such
a
trap
.
<EOS>
His
title
was
purchased
,
and
he
reaped
his
reward
in
the
consequence
it
gave
him
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
acted
likewise
;
and
it
was
about
this
time
that
the
connection
between
the
worthy
pair
commenced
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
they
had
been
in
opposition
,
and
though
very
different
in
temperament
and
in
modes
of
proceeding
,
they
had
one
aim
in
common
;
and
recognizing
great
merit
in
each
other
,
coupled
with
a
power
of
mutual
assistance
,
they
agreed
to
act
in
concert
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
was
as
cautious
and
timid
as
Sir
Giles
was
daring
and
inflexible
:
the
one
being
the
best
contriver
of
a
scheme
,
and
the
other
the
fittest
to
carry
it
out
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
trembled
at
his
own
devices
and
their
possible
consequences
:
Sir
Giles
adopted
his
schemes
,
if
promising
,
and
laughed
at
the
difficulties
and
dangers
that
beset
them
.
<EOS>
The
one
was
the
head
;
the
other
the
arm
.
<EOS>
Not
that
Sir
Giles
lacked
the
ability
to
weave
as
subtle
a
web
of
deceit
as
his
partner
;
but
each
took
his
line
.
<EOS>
It
saved
time
.
<EOS>
The
plan
of
licensing
and
inspecting
taverns
and
hotels
had
originated
with
Sir
Francis
,
and
very
profitable
it
proved
.
<EOS>
But
Sir
Giles
carried
it
out
much
further
than
his
partner
had
proposed
,
or
thought
prudent
.
<EOS>
And
they
were
as
different
in
personal
appearance
,
as
in
mental
qualities
and
disposition
.
<EOS>
Mompesson
was
the
dashing
eagle
;
Mitchell
the
sorry
kite
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
was
weakly
,
emaciated
in
frame
;
much
given
to
sensual
indulgence
;
and
his
body
conformed
to
his
timorous
organization
.
<EOS>
His
shrunken
shanks
scarcely
sufficed
to
support
him
;
his
back
was
bent
;
his
eyes
blear
;
his
head
bald
;
and
his
chin
,
which
was
continually
wagging
,
clothed
with
a
scanty
yellow
beard
,
shaped
like
a
stiletto
,
while
his
sandy
moustachios
were
curled
upward
.
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
in
the
extremity
of
the
fashion
,
and
affected
the
air
of
a
young
court
gallant
.
<EOS>
His
doublet
,
hose
,
and
mantle
were
ever
of
the
gayest
and
most
fanciful
hues
,
and
of
the
richest
stuffs
;
he
wore
a
diamond
brooch
in
his
beaver
,
and
sashes
,
tied
like
garters
,
round
his
thin
legs
,
which
were
utterly
destitute
of
calf
.
<EOS>
Preposterously
large
roses
covered
his
shoes
;
his
ruff
was
a
"
treble
-
quadruple
-
dedalion
;
"
his
gloves
richly
embroidered
;
a
large
crimson
satin
purse
hung
from
his
girdle
;
and
he
was
scented
with
powders
and
pulvilios
.
<EOS>
This
withered
coxcomb
affected
the
mincing
gait
of
a
young
man
;
and
though
rather
an
object
of
derision
than
admiration
with
the
fair
sex
,
persuaded
himself
they
were
all
captivated
by
him
.
<EOS>
The
vast
sums
he
so
unjustly
acquired
did
not
long
remain
in
his
possession
,
but
were
dispersed
in
ministering
to
his
follies
and
depravity
.
<EOS>
Timorous
he
was
by
nature
,
as
we
have
said
,
but
cruel
and
unrelenting
in
proportion
to
his
cowardice
;
and
where
an
injury
could
be
securely
inflicted
,
or
a
prostrate
foe
struck
with
impunity
,
he
never
hesitated
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
himself
was
scarcely
so
malignant
and
implacable
.
<EOS>
A
strong
contrast
to
this
dastardly
debauchee
was
offered
by
the
bolder
villain
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
was
a
very
handsome
man
,
with
a
striking
physiognomy
,
but
dark
and
sinister
in
expression
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
black
,
singularly
piercing
,
and
flashed
with
the
fiercest
fire
when
kindled
by
passion
.
<EOS>
A
finely
-
formed
aquiline
nose
gave
a
hawk
-
like
character
to
his
face
;
his
hair
was
coal
-
black
(
though
he
was
no
longer
young
)
,
and
hung
in
long
ringlets
over
his
neck
and
shoulders
.
<EOS>
He
wore
the
handsomely
cut
beard
and
moustache
subsequently
depicted
in
the
portraits
of
Vandyke
,
which
suited
the
stern
gravity
of
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
Rich
,
though
sober
in
his
attire
,
he
always
affected
a
dark
colour
,
being
generally
habited
in
a
doublet
of
black
quilted
silk
,
Venetian
hose
,
and
a
murrey
-
coloured
velvet
mantle
.
<EOS>
His
conical
hat
was
ornamented
with
a
single
black
ostrich
feather
;
and
he
carried
a
long
rapier
by
his
side
,
in
the
use
of
which
he
was
singularly
skilful
;
being
one
of
Vincentio
Saviolo
's
best
pupils
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
was
a
little
above
the
middle
height
,
with
a
well
proportioned
athletic
figure
;
and
his
strength
and
address
were
such
,
that
there
seemed
good
reason
for
his
boast
when
he
declared
,
as
he
often
did
,
"
that
he
feared
no
man
living
,
in
fair
fight
,
no
,
nor
any
two
men
.
<EOS>
"Sir
<EOS>
Giles
had
none
of
the
weaknesses
of
his
partner
.
<EOS>
Temperate
in
his
living
,
he
had
never
been
known
to
commit
an
excess
at
table
;
nor
were
the
blandishments
or
lures
of
the
fair
sex
ever
successfully
spread
for
him
.
<EOS>
If
his
arm
was
of
iron
,
his
heart
seemed
of
adamant
,
utterly
impenetrable
by
any
gentle
emotion
.
<EOS>
It
was
affirmed
,
and
believed
,
that
he
had
never
shed
a
tear
.
<EOS>
His
sole
passion
appeared
to
be
the
accumulation
of
wealth
;
unattended
by
the
desire
to
spend
it
.
<EOS>
He
bestowed
no
gifts
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
family
,
no
kinsmen
,
whom
he
cared
to
acknowledge
.
<EOS>
He
stood
alone
—
a
hard
,
grasping
man
:
a
bond
-
slave
of
Mammon
.
<EOS>
When
it
pleased
him
,
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
could
play
the
courtier
,
and
fawn
and
gloze
like
the
rest
.
<EOS>
A
consummate
hypocrite
,
he
easily
assumed
any
part
he
might
be
called
upon
to
enact
;
but
the
tone
natural
to
him
was
one
of
insolent
domination
and
bitter
raillery
.
<EOS>
He
sneered
at
all
things
human
and
divine
;
and
there
was
mockery
in
his
laughter
,
as
well
as
venom
in
his
jests
.
<EOS>
His
manner
,
however
,
was
not
without
a
certain
cold
and
grave
dignity
;
and
he
clothed
himself
,
like
his
purposes
,
in
inscrutable
reserve
,
on
occasions
requiring
it
.
<EOS>
So
ominous
was
his
presence
,
that
many
persons
got
out
of
his
way
,
fearing
to
come
in
contact
with
him
,
or
give
him
offence
;
and
the
broad
walk
at
Paul
's
was
sometimes
cleared
as
he
took
his
way
along
it
,
followed
by
his
band
of
tipstaves
.
<EOS>
If
this
were
the
case
with
persons
who
had
no
immediate
ground
of
apprehension
from
him
,
how
much
terror
his
sombre
figure
must
have
inspired
,
when
presented
,
as
it
was
,
to
Madame
Bonaventure
,
with
the
aspect
of
a
merciless
creditor
,
armed
with
full
power
to
enforce
his
claims
,
and
resolved
not
to
abate
a
jot
of
them
,
will
be
revealed
to
the
reader
in
our
next
chapter
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
III.The
<EOS>
French
Ordinary
.
<EOS>
The
month
allowed
by
the
notice
expired
,
and
Madame
Bonaventure
's
day
of
reckoning
arrived
.
<EOS>
No
arrangement
had
been
attempted
in
the
interim
,
though
abundant
opportunities
of
doing
so
were
afforded
her
,
as
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
visited
the
Three
Cranes
almost
daily
.
<EOS>
She
appeared
to
treat
the
matter
very
lightly
,
always
putting
it
off
when
mentioned
;
and
even
towards
the
last
seemed
quite
unconcerned
,
as
if
entertaining
no
fear
of
the
result
.
<EOS>
Apparently
,
everything
went
on
just
as
usual
,
and
no
one
would
have
supposed
,
from
Madame
Bonaventure
's
manner
,
that
she
was
aware
of
the
possibility
of
a
mine
being
sprung
beneath
her
feet
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
fancied
she
had
countermined
her
opponents
,
and
so
felt
secure
.
<EOS>
Her
indifference
puzzled
Sir
Francis
,
who
knew
not
whether
to
attribute
it
to
insensibility
or
over
-
confidence
.
<EOS>
He
was
curious
to
see
how
she
would
conduct
herself
when
the
crisis
came
;
and
for
that
purpose
repaired
to
the
tavern
,
about
dinner
-
time
,
on
the
appointed
day
.
<EOS>
The
hostess
received
him
very
graciously
;
trifled
and
jested
with
him
as
was
her
custom
,
and
looked
all
blandishments
and
smiles
to
him
and
everybody
else
,
as
if
nothing
could
possibly
happen
to
disturb
her
serenity
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
was
more
perplexed
than
ever
.
<EOS>
With
the
levity
and
heedlessness
of
a
Frenchwoman
,
she
must
have
forgotten
all
about
the
claim
.
<EOS>
What
if
he
should
venture
to
remind
her
of
it
?
<EOS>
Better
not
.
<EOS>
The
application
would
come
soon
enough
.
<EOS>
He
was
glad
it
devolved
upon
his
partner
,
and
not
on
himself
,
to
proceed
to
extremities
with
so
charming
a
person
.
<EOS>
He
really
could
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
And
yet
all
the
while
he
chuckled
internally
as
he
thought
of
the
terrible
dilemma
in
which
she
would
be
speedily
caught
,
and
how
completely
it
would
place
her
at
his
mercy
.
<EOS>
She
must
come
to
terms
then
.
<EOS>
And
Sir
Francis
rubbed
his
skinny
hands
gleefully
at
the
thought
.
<EOS>
On
her
part
,
Madame
Bonaventure
guessed
what
was
passing
in
his
breast
,
and
secretly
enjoyed
the
idea
of
checkmating
him
.
<EOS>
With
a
captivating
smile
she
left
him
to
attend
to
her
numerous
guests
.
<EOS>
And
very
numerous
they
were
on
that
day
.
<EOS>
More
so
than
usual
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
,
who
had
brought
a
boat
from
Westminster
,
where
he
dwelt
,
experienced
some
difficulty
in
landing
at
the
stairs
,
invested
as
they
were
with
barges
,
wherries
and
watermen
,
all
of
whom
had
evidently
brought
customers
to
the
Three
Cranes
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
,
there
were
two
or
three
gilded
pinnaces
lying
off
the
wharf
,
with
oarsmen
in
rich
liveries
,
evidently
belonging
to
persons
of
rank
.
<EOS>
The
benches
and
little
tables
in
front
of
the
tavern
were
occupied
by
foreign
merchants
and
traders
,
discussing
their
affairs
over
a
stoop
of
Bordeaux
.
<EOS>
Others
,
similarly
employed
,
sat
at
the
open
casements
in
the
rooms
above
;
each
story
projecting
so
much
beyond
the
other
that
the
old
building
,
crowned
with
its
fanciful
gables
and
heavy
chimnies
,
looked
top
-
heavy
,
and
as
if
it
would
roll
over
into
the
Thames
some
day
.
<EOS>
Others
,
again
,
were
seated
over
their
wine
in
the
pleasant
little
chamber
built
over
the
porch
,
which
,
advancing
considerably
beyond
the
door
,
afforded
a
delightful
prospect
,
from
its
lantern
-
like
windows
,
of
the
river
,
now
sparkling
with
sunshine
(
it
was
a
bright
May
day
)
,
and
covered
with
craft
,
extending
on
the
one
hand
to
Baynard
's
Castle
,
and
on
the
other
to
the
most
picturesque
object
to
be
found
then
,
or
since
,
in
London
—
the
ancient
Bridge
,
with
its
towers
,
gateways
,
lofty
superstructures
,
and
narrow
arches
through
which
the
current
dashed
swiftly
;
and
,
of
course
,
commanding
a
complete
view
of
the
opposite
bank
,
beginning
with
Saint
Saviour
's
fine
old
church
,
Winchester
House
,
the
walks
,
gardens
,
and
play
-
houses
,
and
ending
with
the
fine
groves
of
timber
skirting
Lambeth
Marshes
.
<EOS>
Others
repaired
to
the
smooth
and
well
-
kept
bowling
alley
in
the
narrow
court
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
where
there
was
a
mulberry
tree
two
centuries
older
than
the
tavern
itself
—
to
recreate
themselves
with
the
healthful
pastime
there
afforded
,
and
indulge
at
the
same
time
in
a
few
whiffs
of
tobacco
,
which
,
notwithstanding
the
king
's
fulminations
against
it
,
had
already
made
its
way
among
the
people
.
<EOS>
The
ordinary
was
held
in
the
principal
room
in
the
house
;
which
was
well
enough
adapted
for
the
purpose
,
being
lofty
and
spacious
,
and
lighted
by
an
oriel
window
at
the
upper
end
.
<EOS>
Over
the
high
carved
chimney
-
piece
were
the
arms
of
the
Vintners
'
Company
,
with
a
Bacchus
for
the
crest
.
<EOS>
The
ceiling
was
moulded
,
and
the
wainscots
of
oak
;
against
the
latter
several
paintings
were
hung
.
<EOS>
One
of
these
represented
the
Massacre
of
St.
Bartholomew
,
and
another
the
triumphal
entry
of
Henri
IV
.
<EOS>
into
rebellious
Paris
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
,
there
were
portraits
of
the
reigning
monarch
,
James
the
First
;
the
Marquis
of
Buckingham
,
his
favourite
;
and
the
youthful
Louis
XIII
.
<EOS>
,
king
of
France
.
<EOS>
A
long
table
generally
ran
down
the
centre
of
the
room
;
but
on
this
occasion
there
was
a
raised
cross
-
table
at
the
upper
end
,
with
a
traverse
,
or
curtain
,
partially
drawn
before
it
,
proclaiming
the
presence
of
important
guests
.
<EOS>
Here
the
napery
was
finer
,
and
the
drinking
-
vessels
handsomer
,
than
those
used
at
the
lower
board
.
<EOS>
A
grand
banquet
seemed
taking
place
.
<EOS>
Long
-
necked
flasks
were
placed
in
coolers
,
and
the
buffets
were
covered
with
flagons
and
glasses
.
<EOS>
The
table
groaned
beneath
the
number
and
variety
of
dishes
set
upon
it
.
<EOS>
In
addition
to
the
customary
yeomen
-
waiters
,
there
were
a
host
of
serving
-
men
in
rich
and
varied
liveries
,
but
these
attended
exclusively
on
their
lords
at
the
raised
table
,
behind
the
traverse
.
<EOS>
As
Sir
Francis
was
ushered
into
the
eating
-
room
,
he
was
quite
taken
aback
by
the
unusually
magnificent
display
,
and
felt
greatly
surprised
that
no
hint
of
the
banquet
had
been
given
him
,
on
his
arrival
,
by
the
hostess
.
<EOS>
The
feast
had
already
commenced
;
and
all
the
yeomen
-
waiters
and
trencher
-
scrapers
were
too
busily
occupied
to
attend
to
him
.
<EOS>
Cyprien
,
who
marshalled
the
dishes
at
the
lower
table
,
did
not
deign
to
notice
him
,
and
was
deaf
to
his
demand
for
a
place
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
probable
he
would
not
obtain
one
at
all
;
and
he
was
about
to
retire
,
much
disconcerted
,
when
a
young
man
somewhat
plainly
habited
,
and
who
seemed
a
stranger
to
all
present
,
very
good
-
naturedly
made
room
for
him
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
he
was
squeezed
in
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
then
cast
a
look
round
to
ascertain
who
were
present
;
but
he
was
so
inconveniently
situated
,
and
the
crowd
of
serving
-
men
was
so
great
at
the
upper
table
,
that
he
could
only
imperfectly
distinguish
those
seated
at
it
;
besides
which
,
most
of
the
guests
were
hidden
by
the
traverse
.
<EOS>
Such
,
however
,
as
he
could
make
out
were
richly
attired
in
doublets
of
silk
and
satin
,
while
their
rich
velvet
mantles
,
plumed
and
jewelled
caps
,
and
long
rapiers
,
were
carried
by
their
servants
.
<EOS>
Two
or
three
turned
round
to
look
at
him
as
he
sat
down
;
and
amongst
these
he
remarked
Sir
Edward
Villiers
,
whose
presence
was
far
from
agreeable
to
him,—for
though
Sir
Edward
was
secretly
connected
with
him
and
Sir
Giles
,
and
took
tithe
of
their
spoliations
,
he
disowned
them
in
public
,
and
would
assuredly
not
countenance
any
open
display
of
their
rapacious
proceedings
.
<EOS>
Another
personage
whom
he
recognised
,
from
his
obesity
,
the
peculiarity
of
his
long
flowing
periwig
,
and
his
black
velvet
Parisian
pourpoint
,
which
contrasted
forcibly
with
the
glittering
habiliments
of
his
companions
,
was
Doctor
Mayerne
-
Turquet
,
the
celebrated
French
professor
of
medicine
,
then
so
high
in
favour
with
James
,
that
,
having
been
loaded
with
honours
and
dignities
,
he
had
been
recently
named
the
King
's
first
physician
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Mayerne
's
abilities
were
so
distinguished
,
that
his
Protestant
faith
alone
,
prevented
him
from
occupying
the
same
eminent
position
in
the
court
of
France
that
he
did
in
that
of
England
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
's
presence
at
the
banquet
was
unpropitious
;
it
was
natural
he
should
befriend
a
countrywoman
and
a
Huguenot
like
himself
,
and
,
possessing
the
royal
ear
,
he
might
make
such
representations
as
he
pleased
to
the
King
of
what
should
occur
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
hoped
he
would
be
gone
before
Sir
Giles
appeared
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
yet
a
third
person
,
who
gave
the
usurious
knight
more
uneasiness
than
the
other
two
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
handsome
young
man
,
with
fair
hair
and
delicate
features
,
whose
slight
elegant
figure
was
arrayed
in
a
crimson
-
satin
doublet
,
slashed
with
white
,
and
hose
of
the
same
colours
and
fabric
.
<EOS>
The
young
nobleman
in
question
,
whose
handsome
features
and
prematurely
-
wasted
frame
bore
the
impress
of
cynicism
and
debauchery
,
was
Lord
Roos
,
then
recently
entrapped
into
marriage
with
the
daughter
of
Sir
Thomas
Lake
,
Secretary
of
State
:
<EOS>
a
marriage
productive
of
the
usual
consequences
of
such
imprudent
arrangements
—
neglect
on
the
one
side
,
unhappiness
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
Lord
Roos
was
Sir
Francis
's
sworn
enemy
.
<EOS>
Like
many
other
such
gay
moths
,
he
had
been
severely
singed
by
fluttering
into
the
dazzling
lights
held
up
to
him
,
when
he
wanted
money
,
by
the
two
usurers
;
and
he
had
often
vowed
revenge
against
them
for
the
manner
in
which
they
had
fleeced
him
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
did
not
usually
give
any
great
heed
to
his
threats
,
being
too
much
accustomed
to
reproaches
and
menaces
from
his
victims
to
feel
alarm
or
compunction
;
but
just
now
the
case
was
different
,
and
he
could
not
help
fearing
the
vindictive
young
lord
might
seize
the
opportunity
of
serving
him
an
ill
turn,—if
,
indeed
,
he
had
not
come
there
expressly
for
the
purpose
,
which
seemed
probable
,
from
the
fierce
and
disdainful
glances
he
cast
at
him
.
<EOS>
An
angry
murmur
pervaded
the
upper
table
on
Sir
Francis
's
appearance
;
and
something
was
said
which
,
though
he
could
not
gather
its
precise
import
did
not
sound
agreeably
to
his
ears
.
<EOS>
He
felt
he
had
unwittingly
brought
his
head
near
a
hornet
's
nest
,
and
might
esteem
himself
lucky
if
he
escaped
without
stinging
.
<EOS>
However
,
there
was
no
retreating
now
;
for
though
his
fear
counselled
flight
,
very
shame
restrained
him
.
<EOS>
The
repast
was
varied
and
abundant
,
consisting
of
all
kinds
of
fricassees
,
collops
and
rashers
,
boiled
salmon
from
the
Thames
,
trout
and
pike
from
the
same
river
,
boiled
pea
-
chickens
,
and
turkey
-
poults
,
and
florentines
of
puff
paste
,
calves
-
foot
pies
,
and
set
custards
.
<EOS>
Between
each
guest
a
boiled
salad
was
placed
,
which
was
nothing
more
than
what
we
should
term
a
dish
of
vegetables
,
except
that
the
vegetables
were
somewhat
differently
prepared
;
cinnamon
,
ginger
,
and
sugar
being
added
to
the
pulped
carrots
,
besides
a
handful
of
currants
,
vinegar
,
and
butter
.
<EOS>
A
similar
plan
was
adopted
with
the
salads
of
burrage
,
chicory
,
marigold
leaves
,
bugloss
,
asparagus
,
rocket
,
and
alexanders
,
and
many
other
plants
discontinued
in
modern
cookery
,
but
then
much
esteemed
;
oil
and
vinegar
being
used
with
some
,
and
spices
with
all
;
while
each
dish
was
garnished
with
slices
of
hard
-
boiled
eggs
.
<EOS>
A
jowl
of
sturgeon
was
carried
to
the
upper
table
,
where
there
was
also
a
baked
swan
,
and
a
roasted
bustard
,
flanked
by
two
stately
venison
pasties
.
<EOS>
This
was
only
the
first
service
;
and
two
others
followed
,
consisting
of
a
fawn
,
with
a
pudding
inside
it
,
a
grand
salad
,
hot
olive
pies
,
baked
neats
'
tongues
,
fried
calves
'
tongues
,
baked
Italian
puddings
,
a
farced
leg
of
lamb
in
the
French
fashion
,
orangeado
pie
,
buttered
crabs
,
anchovies
,
and
a
plentiful
supply
of
little
made
dishes
,
and
quelquechoses
,
scattered
over
the
table
.
<EOS>
With
such
a
profusion
of
good
things
,
it
may
appear
surprising
that
Sir
Francis
should
find
very
little
to
eat
;
but
the
attendants
all
seemed
in
league
against
him
,
and
whenever
he
set
his
eye
upon
a
dish
,
it
was
sure
to
be
placed
out
of
reach
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
was
a
great
epicure
,
and
the
Thames
salmon
looked
delicious
;
but
he
would
have
failed
in
obtaining
a
slice
of
it
,
if
his
neighbour
(
the
young
man
who
had
made
room
for
him
)
had
not
given
him
the
well
-
filled
trencher
intended
for
himself
.
<EOS>
In
the
same
way
he
secured
the
wing
of
a
boiled
capon
,
larded
with
preserved
lemons
,
the
sauce
of
which
was
exquisite
,
as
he
well
knew
,
from
experience
.
<EOS>
Cyprien
,
however
,
took
care
he
should
get
none
of
the
turkey
poults
,
or
the
florentines
,
but
whipped
off
both
dishes
from
under
his
very
nose
;
and
a
like
fate
would
have
attended
a
lumbar
pie
but
for
the
interference
of
his
good
-
natured
neighbour
,
who
again
came
to
his
aid
,
and
rescued
it
from
the
clutches
of
the
saucy
Gascon
,
just
as
it
was
being
borne
away
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IV.A
Star
-
Chamber
Victim
.
<EOS>
His
hunger
being
somewhat
stayed
,
Sir
Francis
now
found
leisure
to
consider
the
young
man
who
had
so
greatly
befriended
him
,
and
,
as
a
means
of
promoting
conversation
between
them
,
began
by
filling
his
glass
from
a
flask
of
excellent
Bordeaux
,
of
which
,
in
spite
of
Cyprien
's
efforts
to
prevent
him
,
he
had
contrived
to
gain
possession
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
acknowledged
his
courtesy
with
a
smile
,
praised
the
wine
,
and
expressed
his
astonishment
at
the
wonderful
variety
and
excellence
of
the
repast
,
for
which
he
said
he
was
quite
unprepared
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
Sir
Francis
's
way
to
feel
or
express
much
interest
in
strangers
,
and
he
disliked
young
men
,
especially
when
they
were
handsome
,
as
was
the
case
with
his
new
acquaintance
;
but
there
was
something
in
the
youth
that
riveted
his
attention
.
<EOS>
From
the
plainness
of
his
attire
,
and
a
certain
not
unpleasing
rusticity
of
air
,
Sir
Francis
comprehended
at
once
that
he
was
fresh
from
the
country
;
but
he
also
felt
satisfied
,
from
his
bearing
and
deportment
,
that
he
was
a
gentleman
:
a
term
not
quite
so
vaguely
applied
then
,
as
it
is
now
-
a
-
days
.
<EOS>
The
youth
had
a
fine
frank
countenance
,
remarkable
for
manly
beauty
and
intelligence
,
and
a
figure
perfectly
proportioned
and
athletic
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
set
him
down
as
well
skilled
in
all
exercises
;
vaulting
,
leaping
,
riding
,
and
tossing
the
pike
;
nor
was
he
mistaken
.
<EOS>
He
also
concluded
him
to
be
fond
of
country
sports
;
and
he
was
right
in
the
supposition
.
<EOS>
He
further
imagined
the
young
man
had
come
to
town
to
better
his
fortune
,
and
seek
a
place
at
Court
;
and
he
was
not
far
wrong
in
the
notion
.
<EOS>
As
the
wily
knight
scanned
the
handsome
features
of
his
companion
,
his
clean
-
made
limbs
,
and
symmetrical
figure
,
he
thought
that
success
must
infallibly
attend
the
production
of
such
a
fair
youth
at
a
Court
where
personal
advantages
were
the
first
consideration
.
<EOS>
"A
likely
gallant
,
"
he
reflected
,
"
to
take
the
fancy
of
the
king
;
and
if
I
aid
him
with
means
to
purchase
rich
attire
,
and
procure
him
a
presentation
,
he
may
not
prove
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
But
of
that
I
shall
take
good
security
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
gratitude
is
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
introduced
to
my
Lady
Suffolk
.
<EOS>
She
will
know
how
to
treat
him
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
he
must
cast
his
country
slough
.
<EOS>
That
ill
-
made
doublet
of
green
cloth
must
be
exchanged
for
one
of
velvet
slashed
in
the
Venetian
style
like
mine
own
,
with
hose
stuffed
and
bombasted
according
to
the
mode
.
<EOS>
A
silk
stocking
will
bring
out
the
nice
proportions
of
his
leg
;
though
,
as
I
am
a
true
gentleman
,
the
youth
has
so
well
formed
a
limb
that
even
his
own
villainous
yarn
coverings
can
not
disfigure
it
.
<EOS>
His
hair
is
of
a
good
brown
colour
,
which
the
king
affects
much
,
and
seems
to
curl
naturally
;
but
it
wants
trimming
to
the
mode
,
for
he
is
rough
as
a
young
colt
fresh
from
pasture
;
and
though
he
hath
not
much
beard
on
his
chin
or
upper
lip
,
yet
<EOS>
what
he
hath
becomes
him
well
,
and
will
become
him
better
,
when
properly
clipped
and
twisted
.
<EOS>
Altogether
he
is
as
goodly
a
youth
as
one
would
desire
to
see
.
<EOS>
What
if
he
should
supplant
Buckingham
,
as
Buckingham
supplanted
Somerset
?
<EOS>
Let
the
proud
Marquis
look
to
himself
!
<EOS>
We
may
work
his
overthrow
yet
.
<EOS>
And
now
to
question
him
.
"After
<EOS>
replenishing
his
glass
,
Sir
Francis
addressed
himself
in
his
blandest
accents
,
and
with
his
most
insidious
manner
,
to
his
youthful
neighbour:—"For
a
stranger
to
town
,
as
I
conclude
you
to
be
,
young
Sir
,
"
he
said
,
"
you
have
made
rather
a
lucky
hit
in
coming
hither
to
-
day
,
since
you
have
not
only
got
a
better
dinner
than
I
(
a
constant
frequenter
of
this
French
ordinary
)
ever
saw
served
here—(though
<EOS>
the
attendance
is
abominable
,
as
you
must
have
remarked
—
that
rascally
Cyprien
deserves
the
bastinado
,
)
;
but
your
civility
and
good
manners
have
introduced
you
to
one
,
who
may
,
without
presumption
,
affirm
that
he
hath
the
will
,
and
,
it
may
be
,
the
ability
to
serve
you
;
if
you
will
only
point
out
to
him
the
way
.
<EOS>
""Nay
,
worthy
Sir
,
you
are
too
kind
,
"
the
young
man
modestly
replied
;
"
I
have
done
nothing
to
merit
your
good
opinion
,
though
I
am
happy
to
have
gained
it
.
<EOS>
I
rejoice
that
accident
has
so
far
befriended
me
as
to
bring
me
here
on
this
festive
occasion
;
and
I
rejoice
yet
more
that
it
has
brought
me
acquainted
with
a
worthy
gentleman
like
yourself
,
to
whom
my
rustic
manners
prove
not
to
be
displeasing
.
<EOS>
I
have
too
few
friends
to
neglect
any
that
chance
may
offer
;
and
as
I
must
carve
my
own
way
in
the
world
,
and
fight
for
a
position
in
it
,
I
gladly
accept
any
hand
that
may
be
stretched
out
to
help
me
in
the
struggle
.
<EOS>
""Just
as
I
would
have
it
<EOS>
,
"
Sir
Francis
thought
,
"
The
very
man
I
took
him
for
.
<EOS>
As
I
am
a
true
gentleman
,
mine
shall
not
be
wanting
,
my
good
youth
,
"
he
added
aloud
,
with
apparent
cordiality
,
and
affecting
to
regard
the
other
with
great
interest
;
"
and
when
I
learn
the
particular
direction
in
which
you
intend
to
shape
your
course
,
I
shall
be
the
better
able
to
advise
and
guide
you
.
<EOS>
There
are
many
ways
to
fortune
.
<EOS>
""Mine
should
be
the
shortest
if
I
had
any
choice
,
"
the
young
man
rejoined
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"Right
<EOS>
,
quite
right
,
"
the
crafty
knight
returned
.
<EOS>
"
All
men
would
take
that
road
if
they
could
find
it
.
<EOS>
But
with
some
the
shortest
road
would
not
be
the
safest
.
<EOS>
In
your
case
I
think
it
might
be
different
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
sufficiently
good
mien
,
and
a
sufficiently
good
figure
,
to
serve
you
in
lieu
of
other
advantages
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
fair
speech
would
put
me
in
conceit
with
myself
,
worthy
Sir
,
"
the
young
man
rejoined
with
a
well
-
pleased
air
;
"
were
I
not
too
conscious
of
my
own
demerits
,
not
to
impute
what
you
say
of
me
to
good
nature
,
or
to
flattery
.
<EOS>
""There
<EOS>
you
wrong
me
,
my
good
young
friend
—
on
my
credit
,
you
do
.
<EOS>
Were
I
to
resort
to
adulation
,
I
must
strain
the
points
of
compliment
to
find
phrases
that
should
come
up
to
my
opinion
of
your
good
looks
;
and
as
to
my
friendly
disposition
towards
you
,
I
have
already
said
that
your
attentions
have
won
it
,
so
that
mere
good
nature
does
not
prompt
my
words
.
<EOS>
I
speak
of
you
,
as
I
think
.
<EOS>
May
I
,
without
appearing
too
inquisitive
,
ask
from
what
part
of
the
country
you
come?""I
am
from
Norfolk
,
worthy
Sir
,
"
the
young
man
answered
,
"
where
my
life
has
been
spent
among
a
set
of
men
wild
and
uncouth
,
and
fond
of
the
chase
as
the
Sherwood
archers
we
read
of
in
the
ballads
.
<EOS>
I
am
the
son
of
a
broken
gentleman
;
the
lord
of
a
ruined
house
;
with
one
old
servant
left
me
out
of
fifty
kept
by
my
father
,
and
with
scarce
a
hundred
acres
that
I
can
still
call
my
own
,
out
of
the
thousands
swept
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
Still
I
hunt
in
my
father
's
woods
;
kill
my
father
's
deer
;
and
fish
in
my
father
's
lakes
;
since
no
one
molests
me
.
<EOS>
And
I
keep
up
the
little
church
near
the
old
tumble
-
down
hall
,
in
which
are
the
tombs
of
my
ancestors
,
and
where
my
father
lies
buried
;
and
the
tenantry
come
there
yet
on
Sundays
,
though
I
am
no
longer
their
master
;
and
my
father
's
old
chaplain
,
Sir
Oliver
,
still
preaches
there
,
though
my
father
's
son
can
no
longer
maintain
him
.
<EOS>
""A
sad
change
,
truly
,
"
Sir
Francis
said
,
in
a
tone
of
sympathy
,
and
with
a
look
of
well
-
feigned
concern
;
"
and
attributable
,
I
much
fear
,
to
riot
and
profusion
on
the
part
of
your
father
,
who
so
beggared
his
son
.
""Not
<EOS>
so
,
Sir
,
"
the
young
man
gravely
replied
;
"
my
father
was
a
most
honourable
man
,
and
would
have
injured
no
one
,
much
less
the
son
on
whom
he
doated
.
<EOS>
Neither
was
he
profuse
;
but
lived
bountifully
and
well
,
as
a
country
gentleman
,
with
a
large
estate
,
should
live
.
<EOS>
The
cause
of
his
ruin
was
that
he
came
within
the
clutches
of
that
devouring
monster
,
which
,
like
the
insatiate
dragon
of
Rhodes
,
has
swallowed
up
the
substance
of
so
many
families
,
that
our
land
is
threatened
with
desolation
.
<EOS>
My
father
was
ruined
by
that
court
,
which
,
with
a
mockery
of
justice
,
robs
men
of
their
name
,
their
fame
,
their
lands
,
and
goods
;
which
perverts
the
course
of
law
,
and
saps
the
principles
of
equity
;
which
favours
the
knave
,
and
oppresses
the
honest
man
;
which
promotes
and
supports
extortion
and
plunder
;
which
reverses
righteous
judgments
,
and
asserts
its
own
unrighteous
supremacy
,
which
,
by
means
of
its
commissioners
,
spreads
its
hundred
arms
over
the
whole
realm
,
to
pillage
and
destroy
—
so
that
no
one
,
however
distant
,
can
keep
out
of
its
reach
,
or
escape
its
supervision
;
and
which
,
if
it
be
not
uprooted
,
will
,
in
the
end
,
overthrow
the
kingdom

<EOS>
my
good
young
Sir
,
"
Sir
Francis
cried
,
having
vainly
endeavoured
to
interrupt
his
companion
's
angry
denunciation
.
"
<EOS>
Pray
heaven
your
words
have
reached
no
other
ears
than
mine
!
<EOS>
To
speak
of
the
Star
-
Chamber
as
you
have
spoken
is
worse
than
treason
.
<EOS>
Many
a
man
has
lost
his
ears
,
and
been
branded
on
the
brow
,
for
half
you
have
uttered
.
<EOS>
""Is
free
speech
denied
in
this
free
country
?
"
<EOS>
the
young
man
cried
in
astonishment
.
"
<EOS>
Must
one
suffer
grievous
wrong
,
and
not
complain?""Certes
,
you
must
not
contemn
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
or
you
will
incur
its
censure
,
"
Sir
Francis
replied
in
a
low
tone
.
"
<EOS>
No
court
in
England
is
so
jealous
of
its
prerogatives
,
nor
so
severe
in
punishment
of
its
maligners
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
have
its
proceedings
canvassed
,
or
its
judgments
questioned
.
<EOS>
""For
<EOS>
the
plain
reason
,
that
it
knows
they
will
not
bear
investigation
or
discussion
.
<EOS>
Such
is
the
practice
of
all
arbitrary
and
despotic
rule
.
<EOS>
But
will
Englishmen
submit
to
such
tyranny?""Again
,
let
me
counsel
you
to
put
a
bridle
on
your
tongue
,
young
Sir
.
<EOS>
Such
matters
are
not
to
be
talked
of
at
public
tables
—
scarcely
in
private
.
<EOS>
It
is
well
you
have
addressed
yourself
to
one
who
will
not
betray
you
.
<EOS>
The
Star
-
Chamber
hath
its
spies
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Meddle
not
with
it
,
as
you
value
liberty
.
<EOS>
Light
provocation
arouses
its
anger
;
and
once
aroused
,
its
wrath
is
all
-
consuming

V.Jocelyn
Mounchensey
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
risk
incurred
,
the
young
man
,
whose
feelings
were
evidently
deeply
interested
,
seemed
disposed
to
pursue
the
dangerous
theme
;
but
perceiving
one
of
their
opposite
neighbours
glancing
at
them
,
Sir
Francis
checked
him
;
and
filling
his
glass
essayed
to
change
the
conversation
,
by
inquiring
how
long
he
had
been
in
town
,
and
where
he
lodged?"I
only
arrived
in
London
yesterday
,
"
was
the
reply
;
"
yet
I
have
been
here
long
enough
to
make
me
loth
to
return
to
the
woods
and
moors
of
Norfolk
.
<EOS>
As
to
my
lodging
,
it
is
without
the
city
walls
,
near
St.
Botolph
's
Church
,
and
within
a
bow
shot
of
Aldgate
:
a
pleasant
situation
enough
,
looking
towards
the
Spital
Fields
and
the
open
country
.
<EOS>
I
would
fain
have
got
me
others
in
the
Strand
,
or
near
Charing
Cross
,
if
my
scanty
means
would
have
allowed
me
.
<EOS>
Chance
,
as
I
have
said
,
brought
me
here
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Strolling
forth
early
to
view
the
sights
of
town
,
I
crossed
London
Bridge
,
the
magnificence
of
which
amazed
me
;
and
,
proceeding
along
the
Bankside
,
entered
Paris
Garden
,
of
which
I
had
heard
much
,
and
where
I
was
greatly
pleased
,
both
with
the
mastiffs
kept
there
,
and
the
formidable
animals
they
have
to
encounter
;
and
,
methought
,
I
should
like
to
bait
mine
enemies
with
those
savage
dogs
,
instead
of
the
bear
.
<EOS>
Returning
to
the
opposite
shore
in
a
wherry
,
the
waterman
landed
me
at
this
wharf
,
and
so
highly
commended
the
Three
Cranes
,
as
affording
the
best
French
ordinary
and
the
best
French
wine
in
London
,
that
seeing
many
gentlefolk
flocking
towards
it
,
which
seemed
to
confirm
his
statement
,
I
came
in
with
them
,
and
have
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
my
entertainment
,
never
having
dined
so
sumptuously
before
,
and
,
certes
,
never
having
tasted
wine
so
delicious
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
me
fill
your
glass
again

<EOS>
As
I
am
a
true
gentleman
,
it
will
not
hurt
you
;
a
singular
merit
of
pure
Bordeaux
being
that
you
may
drink
it
with
impunity
;
and
the
like
can
not
be
said
of
your
sophisticated
sack
.
<EOS>
We
will
crush
another
flask

<EOS>
Cyprien

I

<EOS>
More

<EOS>
The
best
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
"And
for
a
wonder
the
order
was
obeyed
,
and
the
flask
set
before
him

<EOS>
"You
have
been
at
the
Bankside

say
,
young
Sir

<EOS>
On
my
credit

you
must
cross
the
river
again
and
visit
the
theatres
—
the
Globe
or
the
Rose

<EOS>
Our
great
actor
,
Dick
Burbadge
,
plays
Othello
to

day
,
and
,
I
warrant
me
,
he
will
delight
you

<EOS>
A
little
man
is
Dick
,
but
he
hath
a
mighty
soul
.
<EOS>
There
is
none
other
like
him
,
whether
it
be
Nat
Field
or
Ned
Alleyn

<EOS>
Our
famous
Shakespeare
is
fortunate
<EOS>
,
I
trow
,
in
having
him
to
play
his
great
characters
.
<EOS>
You
must
see
Burbadge
,
likewise
,
in
the
mad
Prince
of
Denmark,—the
part
was
written
for
him
,
and
fits
him
exactly
.
<EOS>
See
him
also
in
gentle
and
love
-
sick
Romeo
,
in
tyrannous
and
murderous
Macbeth
,
and
in
crookback
Richard
;
in
all
of
which
,
though
different
,
our
Dick
is
equally
good
.
<EOS>
He
hath
some
other
parts
of
almost
equal
merit,—as
Malevole
,
in
the
'
Malcontent
;
'
Frankford
,
in
the
'
Woman
Killed
with
Kindness
;
'
Brachiano

<EOS>
'""I

the
young
man
rather
sternly
remarked
;
"
<EOS>
but
if
the
character
of
Vendice
at
all
bears
out
its
name
,
it
would
suit
me

I
am
an
avenger

""Forbear

perfect

raising

drained

"By

narrowly

he
said
,
lowering
his
tone
,
"
I
would
not

overheard
in
what
I
have
to
say

<EOS>
You
were
speaking
just
now
of
the
shortest
way
to
fortune
.
<EOS>
I
will
point
it
out
to
you
.
<EOS>
To
him
,
who
is
bold
enough
to
take
it
,
and
who
hath
the
requisites
for
the
venture
,
the
shortest
way
is
to
be
found
at
Court
.
<EOS>
Where
think
you
most
of
those
gallants
,
of
whom
you
may
catch
a
glimpse
through
the
traverse
,
derive
their
revenues?—As
<EOS>
I
am
a
true
gentleman!—from
the
royal
coffers
.
<EOS>
Not
many
years
ago
,
with
all
of
them
;
not
many
months
ago
,
with
some
;
those
brilliant
and
titled
coxcombs
were
adventurers
like
yourself
,
having
barely
a
Jacobus
in
their
purses
,
and
scarce
credit
for
board
and
lodging
with
their
respective
landladies
.
<EOS>
Now
you
see
how
nobly
they
feast
,
and
how
richly
they
bedeck
themselves
.
<EOS>
On
my
credit
!
<EOS>
the
like
good
fortune
may
attend
you
;
and
haply
,
when
I
dine
at
an
ordinary
a
year
hence
,
I
may
perceive
you
at
the
upper
table
,
with
a
curtain
before
you
to
keep
off
the
meaner
company
,
and
your
serving
-
man
at
your
back
,
holding
your
velvet
mantle
and
cap
,
like
the
best
of
your
fellow
nobles
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
<EOS>
grant
it
may
be
so
!
"
<EOS>
the
young
man
exclaimed
,
with
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
"
You
hold
a
dazzling
picture
before
me
;
but
I
have
little
expectation
of
realizing
it
.
<EOS>
""It
will
be
your
own
fault
if
you
do
not
,
"
the
tempter
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
equally
well
-
favoured
with
the
handsomest
of
them
;
and
it
was
by
good
looks
alone
that
the
whole
party
rose
to
their
present
eminence
.
<EOS>
Why
not
pursue
the
same
course
;
with
the
same
certainty
of
success
?
<EOS>
You
have
courage
enough
to
undertake
it
,
I
presume?""If
courage
alone
were
wanting
<EOS>
,
I
have
that
,
"
<EOS>
the
young
man
<EOS>
replied;—"but
I
am
wholly
unknown
in
town

<EOS>
How
then
shall
I
accomplish
an
introduction
at
Court
,
<EOS>
when
I
know
not
even
its
humblest
attendant?""I
have
already
said
you
were
lucky
in
meeting
with
me
<EOS>
,
"
Sir
Francis
replied
;
"
and
I
find
you
were
luckier
than
I
supposed
,
when
I
told
you
so
;
for
I
knew
not
then
towards
what
bent
your
desires
tended
,
nor
in
what
way
I
could
help
you
;
but
now
,
finding
out
the
boldness
of
your
flight
,
and
the
high
game
you
aim
at
,
I
am
able
to
offer
you
effectual
assistance
,
and
give
you
an
earnest
of
a
prosperous
issue
.
<EOS>
Through
my
means
you
shall
be
presented
to
the
king
,
and
in
such
sort
that
the
presentation
shall
not
be
idly
made
.
<EOS>
It
will
rest
then
with
yourself
to
play
your
cards
dexterously
,
and
to
follow
up
a
winning
game
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
,
you
will
have
many
adversaries
,
who
will
trip
up
your
heels
if
they
can
,
and
throw
every
obstacle
in
your
way
;
but
if
you
possess
the
strong
arm
<EOS>
I
fancy
you
do
,
and
daring
to
second
it
<EOS>
,
you
have
nothing
to
fear
.
<EOS>
As
I
am
a
true
gentleman
!
<EOS>
you
shall
have
good
counsel
,
and
a
friend
in
secret
to
back
you
.
<EOS>
""To
<EOS>
whom
am
I
indebted
for
this
most
gracious
and
unlooked
-
for
offer
?
"
<EOS>
the
young
man
asked
,
his
breast
heaving
,
and
his
eye
flashing
with
excitement
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
one
you
may
perchance
have
heard
of
,
"
the
knight
answered
,
"
as
the
subject
of
some
misrepresentation
;
how
justly
applied
,
you
yourself
will
be
able
to
determine
from
my
present
conduct
.
<EOS>
I
am
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
the
mention
of
this
name
the
young
man
started
,
and
a
deep
angry
flush
overspread
his
face
and
brow
.
<EOS>
Perceiving
the
effect
produced
,
the
wily
knight
hastened
to
remove
it
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
name
<EOS>
,
I
see
,
awakens
unpleasant
associations
in
your
breast
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
your
look
shows
you
have
been
influenced
by
the
calumnies
of
my
enemies
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
blame
you
.
<EOS>
Men
can
only
be
judged
of
by
report
;
and
those
I
have
had
dealings
with
have
reported
ill
enough
of
me
.
<EOS>
But
they
have
spoken
falsely
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
no
more
than
any
other
person
would
do
.
<EOS>
I
have
obtained
the
best
interest
I
could
for
my
money
;
and
my
losses
have
been
almost
equal
to
my
gains
.
<EOS>
Folks
are
ready
enough
to
tell
all
they
can
against
you
;
but
slow
to
mention
aught
they
conceive
to
be
in
your
favour
.
<EOS>
They
stigmatize
me
as
a
usurer
;
but
they
forget
to
add
,
I
am
ever
the
friend
of
those
in
need
.
<EOS>
They
use
me
,
and
abuse
me
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
way
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
Wherefore
,
then
,
should
I
complain
?
<EOS>
I
am
no
worse
off
than
my
neighbours
.
<EOS>
And
the
proof
that
I
can
be
disinterested
is
the
way
in
which
I
have
acted
towards
you
,
a
perfect
stranger
,
and
who
have
no
other
recommendation
to
my
good
offices
than
your
gracious
mien
and
gentle
manners
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
accept
your
proffered
aid
,
Sir
Francis
,
"
the
young
man
replied
,
in
an
altered
tone
,
and
with
great
sternness
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
will
understand
why
I
can
not
,
when
I
announce
myself
to
you
as
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
.
<EOS>
"It
was
now
the
knight
's
turn
to
start
,
change
colour
,
and
tremble
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VI.Provocation
.
<EOS>
A
momentary
pause
ensued
,
during
which
Mounchensey
regarded
the
knight
so
fiercely
,
that
the
latter
began
to
entertain
apprehensions
for
his
personal
safety
,
and
meditated
a
precipitate
retreat
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
did
not
dare
to
move
,
lest
the
action
should
bring
upon
him
the
hurt
he
wished
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
Thus
he
remained
,
like
a
bird
fascinated
by
the
rattlesnake
,
until
the
young
man
,
whose
power
of
speech
seemed
taken
from
him
by
passion
,
went
on
,
in
a
tone
of
deep
and
concentrated
rage
,
that
communicated
a
hissing
sound
to
his
words
.
<EOS>
"Yes
,
I
am
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
,
"
he
said
,
"
the
son
of
him
whom
your
arts
and
those
of
your
partner
in
iniquity
,
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
,
brought
to
destruction
;
the
son
of
him
whom
you
despoiled
of
a
good
name
and
large
estates
,
and
cast
into
a
loathsome
prison
,
to
languish
and
to
die
:
I
am
the
son
of
that
murdered
man
.
<EOS>
I
am
he
whom
you
have
robbed
of
his
inheritance
;
whose
proud
escutcheon
you
have
tarnished
;
whose
family
you
have
reduced
to
beggary
and
utter
ruin
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
,
my
worthy
friend
,
"
the
knight
faltered
,
"
have
patience
,
I
pray
of
you
.
<EOS>
If
you
consider
yourself
aggrieved
,
I
am
willing
to
make
reparation
—
ample
reparation
.
<EOS>
You
know
what
were
my
intentions
towards
you
,
before
I
had
the
slightest
notion
who
you
might
be
.
<EOS>
(
If
I
had
but
been
aware
of
it
,
he
thought
,
I
would
have
taken
care
to
keep
at
a
respectful
distance
from
him
.
)
<EOS>
I
will
do
more
than
I
promised
.
<EOS>
I
will
lend
you
any
sums
of
money
you
may
require
;
and
on
your
personal
security
.
<EOS>
Your
bare
word
shall
suffice
.
<EOS>
No
bonds

no
written
obligations
of
any
kind

<EOS>
Does
that
sound
like
usury
?
<EOS>
As
I
am
a
true
gentleman
!
<EOS>
I
am
most
unfairly
judged
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
the
extortioner
men
describe
me
.
<EOS>
You
shall
find
me
your
friend
,
"
he
added
in
a
low
earnest
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
re
-
establish
your
fortune
;
give
you
a
new
title
,
higher
and
prouder
than
that
which
you
have
lost
;
and
,
if
you
will
follow
my
counsel
,
you
shall
supplant
the
haughty
favourite
himself
.
<EOS>
You
shall
stand
where
Buckingham
now
stands
.
<EOS>
Hear
reason
,
good
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
Hear
reason
,
I
entreat
you
.
<EOS>
""I
will
hear
nothing
further
,
"
Jocelyn
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
Were
you
to
talk
till
Doomsday
,
you
could
not
alter
my
feelings
towards
you
a
jot
.
<EOS>
My
chief
errand
in
coming
to
London
was
to
call
you
and
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
to
strict
account
.
<EOS>
""And
we
will
answer
any
charges
you
may
bring
against
us
readily
—
most
readily
,
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
All
was
done
in
fairness
—
according
to
law
.
<EOS>
The
Star
-
Chamber
will
uphold
us
.
<EOS>
""Tut
!
<EOS>
you
think
to
terrify
me
with
that
bugbear
;
but
I
am
not
so
easily
frightened
.
<EOS>
We
have
met
for
the
first
time
by
chance
,
but
our
next
meeting
shall
be
by
appointment
.
<EOS>
""When
and
<EOS>
where
you
please
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
"
the
knight
replied
;
but
recollect
the
duello
is
forbidden
,
and
,
though
I
would
not
willingly
disappoint
you
in
your
desire
to
cut
my
throat
,
I
should
be
sorry
to
think
you
might
be
hanged
for
it
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
lay
aside
this
idle
passion
,
and
look
to
your
true
interests
,
which
lie
not
in
quarrelling
with
me
,
but
in
our
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
I
can
help
you
effectually
,
as
I
have
shown
;
and
,
as
I
am
a
true
gentleman
,
I
willhelp
you
.
<EOS>
Give
me
your
hand
,
and
let
us
be
friends!""Never
!
"
<EOS>
Jocelyn
exclaimed
,
withdrawing
from
him
,
"
never
shall
the
hand
of
a
Mounchensey
grasp
yours
in
friendship
!
<EOS>
I
would
sooner
mine
rotted
off
!
<EOS>
I
am
your
mortal
foe
.
<EOS>
My
father
's
death
has
to
be
avenged
.
<EOS>
""Provoke
him
<EOS>
not
,
my
good
young
Sir
,
"
interposed
an
elderly
man
,
next
him
,
in
a
long
furred
gown
,
with
hanging
sleeves
,
and
a
flat
cap
on
his
head
,
who
had
heard
what
was
now
passing
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
not
the
mischief
he
may
do
you
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
laugh
at
his
malice
,
and
defy
him
<EOS>
,
"
Jocelyn
cried—"he
shall
not
sit
one
moment
longer
beside
me
.
<EOS>
Out
,
knave
!
out
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
seizing
Sir
Francis
by
the
wing
of
his
doublet
,
and
forcibly
thrusting
him
from
his
seat
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
fit
company
for
honest
men
.
<EOS>
Ho
!
<EOS>
varlets
,
to
the
door
with
him
!
<EOS>
Throw
him
into
the
kennel
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
shall
rue
this
<EOS>
,
villain!—you
shall
rue
it
bitterly
,
"
Sir
Francis
cried
,
shaking
his
clenched
hands
at
him
.
"
<EOS>
Your
father
perished
like
a
dog
in
the
Fleet
,
and
you
shall
perish
there
likewise
.
<EOS>
You
have
put
yourself
wholly
in
my
power
,
and
I
will
make
a
fearful
example
of
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
dared
to
utter
scandalous
and
contemptuous
language
against
the
great
and
high
court
of
Star
-
Chamber
,
before
the
decrees
of
which
,
all
men
bow
;
impugning
its
justice
and
denying
its
authority
;
and
you
shall
feel
the
full
weight
of
its
displeasure
.
<EOS>
I
call
upon
these
worthy
gentlemen
to
testify
against
you
.
<EOS>
""We
have
heard
nothing
,
and
can
testify
nothing
,
"
several
voices
cried
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
you
,
Sir
,
who
were
next
him
,
you
must
have
heard
him
?
"
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
said
,
addressing
the
elderly
man
in
the
furred
gown
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
I
!
"
rejoined
the
person
appealed
to
;
"
I
gave
no
heed
to
what
was
said
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
I
did
,
Sir
Francis
,
"
squeaked
a
little
whey
-
faced
man
,
in
a
large
ruff
and
tight
-
laced
yellow
doublet
,
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
;
"
I
heard
him
most
audaciously
vilipend
the
high
court
of
Star
-
Chamber
and
its
councils
;
and
I
will
bear
testimony
against
him
when
called
upon
.
<EOS>
""Your
name
,
good
Sir
,
your
name
?
"
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
demanded
,
taking
out
his
tablets
.
"Set
<EOS>
me
down
as
Thopas
Trednock
,
tailor
,
at
the
sign
of
the
Pressing
Iron
,
in
Cornhill
,
"
the
whey
-
faced
man
replied
,
in
his
shrill
tones
,
amid
the
derisive
laughter
of
the
assemblage
.
"Thopas
<EOS>
Trednock
,
tailor
—
good
!
"
<EOS>
the
knight
repeated
,
as
he
wrote
the
name
down
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
an
excellent
witness
,
Master
Trednock
.
<EOS>
Fare
you
well
for
the
present
,
Master
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
,
for
I
now
mind
<EOS>
well
your
father
was
degraded
from
the
honour
of
knighthood
.
<EOS>
As
I
am
a
true
gentleman
!
<EOS>
you
may
be
sure
of
committal
to
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
"As
may
be
supposed
,
the
scuffle
which
had
taken
place
,
attracted
the
attention
of
those
in
its
immediate
vicinity
;
and
when
the
cause
of
it
became
known
,
as
it
presently
did
throughout
both
tables
,
great
indignation
was
expressed
against
Sir
Francis
,
who
was
censured
on
all
hands
,
jeered
and
flouted
,
as
he
moved
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
So
great
was
the
clamour
,
and
so
opprobrious
were
the
epithets
and
terms
applied
to
him
,
that
the
knight
was
eager
to
make
his
escape
;
but
he
met
Cyprien
in
his
way
;
and
the
droll
young
Gascon
,
holding
a
dish
-
cover
in
one
hand
,
by
way
of
buckler
,
and
a
long
carving
-
knife
in
the
other
,
in
place
of
a
sword
,
opposed
his
egress
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
me
pass
,
knave
,
"
Sir
Francis
cried
in
alarm
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
your
leave
,
no
,
"
returned
Cyprien
,
encouraged
by
the
laughter
and
plaudits
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
come
hither
uninvited
,
and
must
stay
till
you
have
permission
to
depart
.
<EOS>
Having
partaken
of
the
banquet
,
you
must
,
perforce
,
tarry
for
the
rerebanquet
.
<EOS>
The
sweets
and
cates
have
yet
to
come
,
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
mean
you
,
sirrah
?
<EOS>
"
the
knight
demanded
,
in
increased
trepidation
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
presence
is
necessary
at
a
little
entertainment
I
have
provided
to
follow
the
dinner
,
sweet
Sir
Francis
,
"
Madame
Bonaventure
cried
,
advancing
towards
him
;
"
and
as
you
have
a
principal
part
in
it
,
I
can
by
no
means
spare
you
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
one
can
spare
you
,
sweet
Sir
Francis
,
"
several
voices
chimed
in
,
derisively
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
remain
with
us
a
little
longer
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
I
will
not
stay

<EOS>
I
will
not
be
detained

<EOS>
There
is
some
conspiracy
a

foot
against
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
indict
you
all
for
it
,
if
you
hinder
me
in
going
forth
,
<EOS>
"
the
knight
vociferated
,
in
accents
of
mingled
rage
and
terror
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Stop
me
at
your
peril
,
thou
saucy
Gascon
knave
.
<EOS>
""Cornes
<EOS>
du
diable!—no
more
a
knave
than
yourself
,
gros
usurier
!
"
<EOS>
Cyprien
cried
.
<EOS>
"Laissez
<EOS>
-
lui
,
Cyprien
,
"
Madame
Bonaventure
interposed;—"the
courteous
knight
will
yield
to
my
entreaties
,
and
stay
of
his
own
free
will
.
<EOS>
""I
have
business
that
calls
me
hence
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
,
"
Sir
Francis
said
,
endeavouring
to
push
by
them
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
the
door
be
closed
,
"
an
authoritative
voice
cried
from
the
head
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
The
order
was
instantly
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Two
serving
-
men
stationed
themselves
before
the
place
of
exit
,
and
Sir
Francis
found
himself
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
The
roof
rang
with
the
laughter
and
gibes
of
the
guests
.
<EOS>
"This
is
a
frolic
,
gentleman
,
I
perceive
.
<EOS>
You
are
resolved
to
make
me
your
sport
—
ha
!
ha
!
"
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
said
,
trying
to
disguise
his
uneasiness
under
an
appearance
of
levity—"But
you
will
not
carry
the
jest
too
far
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
maltreat
me
.
<EOS>
My
partner
,
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
,
will
be
here
anon
,
and
will
requite
any
outrage
committed
upon
me
.
<EOS>
""Sir
<EOS>
Giles
is
impatiently
expected
by
us
,
"
a
spruce
coxcomb
near
him
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Madame
Bonaventure
had
prepared
us
for
his
coming
.
<EOS>
We
will
give
him
the
welcome
he
deserves
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
traitress
!
<EOS>
then
it
was
all
planned
,
"
Sir
Francis
thought;—"and
,
blind
owl
that
I
am
,
I
have
fallen
into
the
snare
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
the
poor
knight
was
nearly
at
his
wit
's
end
with
fright
,
when
he
saw
Lord
Roos
quit
his
place
at
the
upper
table
and
approach
him
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VII.How
<EOS>
Lord
Roos
obtained
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
's
signature
.
<EOS>
"What
,
my
prince
of
usurers
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Lord
Roos
,
in
a
mocking
tone
;
"
my
worthy
money
-
lender
,
who
never
takes
more
than
cent
.
<EOS>
per
cent
.
,
and
art
ill
content
with
less
;
who
never
exacts
more
than
the
penalty
of
thy
bond,—unless
more
may
be
got
;
who
never
drives
a
hard
bargain
with
a
needy
man
—
by
thine
own
account
;
who
never
persecutes
a
debtor
—
as
the
prisons
shall
vouch
for
thee
;
who
art
just
in
all
thy
transactions
—
as
every
man
who
hath
had
dealings
with
thee
will
affirm
;
and
who
knows
not
how
to
lie
,
to
cheat
,
to
cozen
—
as
some
usurers
do
.
<EOS>
""You
are
pleasant
,
my
lord
,
"
Sir
Francis
replied
.
<EOS>
"I
mean
to
be
so
,
"
Lord
Roos
said
;
"
for
I
esteem
thee
for
thy
rare
qualities
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
thy
peer
for
cunning
and
knavery
.
<EOS>
Thy
mischievous
schemes
are
so
well
-
conceived
that
they
prove
thee
to
have
an
absolute
genius
for
villany
.
<EOS>
Scruples
thou
hast
none
;
and
considerations
and
feelings
which
might
move
men
less
obdurate
than
thyself
,
have
no
influence
over
thee
.
<EOS>
To
ruin
a
man
is
with
thee
mere
pastime
;
and
groans
of
the
oppressed
are
music
in
thine
ears
.
<EOS>
""Aha
!
<EOS>
a
good
jest
.
<EOS>
You
were
always
merry
with
me
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
""Yes
,
when
I
borrowed
money
from
thee
—
but
not
when
I
had
to
repay
it
twice
over
.
<EOS>
I
laughed
not
then
;
but
was
foolish
enough
to
threaten
to
take
thy
life
.
<EOS>
My
anger
is
past
now
.
<EOS>
But
we
must
drink
together
—
a
rousing
toast
.
<EOS>
""At
your
lordship
's
pleasure
,
"
Sir
Francis
replied
.
<EOS>
"Cyprien
!
<EOS>
a
flask
of
wine
,
and
thy
largest
goblet
,
"
Lord
Roos
cried
.
"
<EOS>
'
Tis
well
!
<EOS>
Now
pour
the
whole
into
the
flagon
.
<EOS>
Do
me
reason
in
this
cup
,
Sir
Francis?""What
!
<EOS>
in
this
mighty
cup
,
my
lord

"
the
knight
replied
.
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
'
tis
too
much
,
I
swear
.
<EOS>
If
I
become
drunken
,
the
sin
will
lie
at
your
door
.
<EOS>
""Off
with
it
!
<EOS>
without
more
ado
.
<EOS>
And
let
the
toast
be
what
thou
practisest—'Pillage
and
Extortion!'""I
can
not
drink
that
toast
,
my
lord

'
<EOS>
Twill
choke
me
.
<EOS>
""'Sdeath
!
<EOS>
villain
,
but
thou
shalt
,
or
thou
shalt
never
taste
wine
more
.
<EOS>
Down
with
it
,
man
!
<EOS>
And
now
your
signature
to
this
paper?""My
signature
!
"
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
cried
,
reeling
from
the
effect
of
the
wine
he
had
swallowed
.
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
my
good
lord
;
I
can
sign
nothing
that
I
have
not
read
.
<EOS>
What
is
it?""A
blank
sheet
,
"
Lord
Roos
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
fill
it
up
afterwards
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
,
my
lord
,
I
refuse
—
that
is
,
I
decline
—
that
is
,
I
had
rather
<EOS>
not
,
if
your
lordship
pleases
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
my
lordship
pleases
otherwise
.
<EOS>
Give
him
pen
and
ink
,
and
set
him
near
the
table
.
<EOS>
"This
was
done
;
and
Sir
Francis
regarded
the
paper
with
swimming
eyes
.
<EOS>
"Now
<EOS>
,
your
name,—written
near
the
bottom
of
the
sheet
,
"
Lord
Roos
cried
.
<EOS>
"'Tis
done
under
com
—
compulsion
;
and
I
pro
—
protest
against
it
.
<EOS>
""Sign
,
I
say
,
"
<EOS>
the
young
nobleman
exclaimed
,
rapping
the
table
peremptorily
.
<EOS>
On
this
,
Sir
Francis
wrote
his
name
in
the
place
indicated
.
"Enough
!
"
<EOS>
Lord
Roos
cried
,
snatching
up
the
paper
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
all
I
want
.
<EOS>
Now
set
him
on
the
table
,
that
his
partner
may
have
him
in
full
view
when
he
arrives
.
'
<EOS>
Twill
give
him
a
foretaste
of
what
he
may
himself
expect
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
mean
you
,
ruff
—
ruffians
?
'
<EOS>
Tis
an
indignity
to
which
I
shall
not
submit
,
"
cried
Sir
Francis
,
who
was
now
,
however
,
too
far
gone
to
offer
any
resistance
.
<EOS>
A
leathern
girdle
was
found
,
with
which
he
was
fastened
to
the
chair
,
so
as
to
prevent
him
slipping
from
it
;
and
in
this
state
he
was
hoisted
upon
the
table
,
and
set
with
his
face
to
the
door
;
looking
the
very
picture
of
inebriety
,
with
his
head
drooping
on
one
side
,
his
arms
dangling
uselessly
down
,
and
his
thin
legs
stretched
idly
out
.
<EOS>
After
making
some
incoherent
objections
to
this
treatment
,
he
became
altogether
silent
,
and
seemed
to
fall
asleep
.
<EOS>
His
elevation
was
received
with
shouts
of
laughter
from
the
whole
company
.
<EOS>
The
incident
had
not
taken
place
many
minutes
,
and
a
round
had
scarcely
been
drunk
by
the
guests
,
when
a
loud
and
peremptory
summons
was
heard
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
noise
roused
even
the
poor
drunkard
in
the
chair
,
who
,
lifting
up
his
head
,
stared
about
him
with
vacant
eyes
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
the
door
be
opened
,
"
the
same
authoritative
voice
exclaimed
,
which
had
before
ordered
its
closure
.
<EOS>
The
mandate
was
obeyed
;
and
,
amidst
profound
silence
,
which
suddenly
succeeded
the
clashing
of
glasses
,
and
expressions
of
hilarity
,
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
entered
,
with
his
body
-
guard
of
myrmidons
behind
him
.
<EOS>
Habited
in
black
,
as
was
his
custom
,
with
a
velvet
mantle
on
his
shoulder
,
and
a
long
rapier
by
his
side
,
he
came
forward
with
a
measured
step
and
assured
demeanour
.
<EOS>
Though
he
must
necessarily
have
been
surprised
by
the
assemblage
he
found
—
so
much
more
numerous
and
splendid
than
he
could
have
anticipated
—
he
betrayed
no
signs
whatever
of
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
Nor
,
though
his
quick
eye
instantly
detected
Sir
Francis
,
and
he
guessed
at
once
why
the
poor
knight
had
been
so
scandalously
treated
,
did
he
exhibit
any
signs
of
displeasure
,
or
take
the
slightest
notice
of
the
circumstance
;
reserving
this
point
for
consideration
,
when
his
first
business
should
be
settled
.
<EOS>
An
additional
frown
might
have
darkened
his
countenance
;
but
it
was
so
stern
and
sombre
,
without
it
,
that
no
perceptible
change
could
be
discerned
;
unless
it
might
be
in
the
lightning
glances
he
cast
around
,
as
if
seeking
some
one
he
might
call
to
account
presently
for
the
insult
.
<EOS>
But
no
one
seemed
willing
to
reply
to
the
challenge
.
<EOS>
Though
bold
enough
before
he
came
,
and
boastful
of
what
they
would
do
,
they
all
looked
awed
by
his
presence
,
and
averted
their
gaze
from
him
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
indeed
,
something
so
formidable
in
the
man
,
that
to
shun
a
quarrel
with
him
was
more
a
matter
of
prudence
than
an
act
of
cowardice
;
and
on
the
present
occasion
,
no
one
liked
to
be
first
to
provoke
him
;
trusting
to
his
neighbour
to
commence
the
attack
,
or
awaiting
the
general
outbreak
.
<EOS>
There
was
one
exception
,
however
,
and
that
was
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
,
who
,
so
far
from
desiring
to
shun
Sir
Giles
's
searching
regards
,
courted
them
;
and
as
the
knight
's
eagle
eye
ranged
round
the
table
and
fell
upon
him
,
the
young
man
(
notwithstanding
the
efforts
of
his
pacific
neighbour
in
the
furred
cloak
to
restrain
him
)
suddenly
rose
up
,
and
throwing
all
the
scorn
and
defiance
he
could
muster
into
his
countenance
,
returned
Mompesson
's
glance
with
one
equally
fierce
and
menacing
.
<EOS>
A
bitter
smile
curled
Sir
Giles
's
lip
at
this
reply
to
his
challenge
,
and
he
regarded
the
young
man
fixedly
,
as
if
to
grave
his
features
upon
his
memory
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
they
brought
Mounchensey
's
father
to
mind
,
for
Sir
Giles
withdrew
his
gaze
for
a
moment
to
reflect
,
and
then
looked
again
at
Jocelyn
with
fresh
curiosity
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
any
doubts
as
to
whom
he
beheld
,
they
were
removed
by
Sir
Francis
,
who
managed
to
hiccup
forth—"'Tis
he
,
Sir
Giles—'tis
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
.
<EOS>
""I
thought
as
much
,
"
Sir
Giles
muttered
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
moment
,
young
man
,
"
he
cried
,
waving
his
hand
imperiously
to
his
antagonist
.
<EOS>
"
Your
turn
will
come
presently
.
<EOS>
"And
without
bestowing
further
notice
on
Jocelyn
,
who
resisted
all
his
neighbour
's
entreaties
to
him
to
sit
down
,
Sir
Giles
advanced
towards
the
middle
chamber
,
where
he
paused
,
and
took
off
his
cap
,
having
hitherto
remained
covered
.
<EOS>
In
this
position
,
he
looked
like
a
grand
inquisitor
attended
by
his
familiars
.

CHAPTER
VIII.Of
Lupo
Vulp
,
Captain
Bludder
,
ClementLanyere
,
and
Sir
Giles
's
other
Myrmidons
.
<EOS>
Close
behind
Sir
Giles
,
and
a
little
in
advance
of
the
rest
of
the
myrmidons
,
stood
Lupo
Vulp
,
the
scrivener
.
<EOS>
Lupo
Vulp
was
the
confidential
adviser
of
our
two
extortioners
,
to
whom
they
referred
all
their
nefarious
projects
.
<EOS>
He
<EOS>
it
was
who
prepared
their
bonds
and
contracts
,
and
placed
out
their
ill
-
gotten
gains
at
exorbitant
usance
.
<EOS>
Lupo
Vulp
was
in
all
respects
worthy
of
his
employers
,
being
just
as
wily
and
unscrupulous
as
they
were
,
while
,
at
the
same
time
,
he
was
rather
better
versed
in
legal
tricks
and
stratagems
,
so
that
he
could
give
them
apt
counsel
in
any
emergency
.
<EOS>
A
countenance
more
replete
with
cunning
and
knavery
than
that
of
Lupo
Vulp
,
it
would
be
difficult
to
discover
.
<EOS>
A
sardonic
smile
hovered
perpetually
about
his
mouth
,
which
was
garnished
with
ranges
of
the
keenest
and
whitest
teeth
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
sharp
;
his
eyes
small
,
set
wide
apart
,
of
a
light
gray
colour
,
and
with
all
the
slyness
of
a
fox
lurking
within
their
furtive
glances
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
his
general
resemblance
to
that
astute
animal
must
have
struck
a
physiognomist
.
<EOS>
His
head
was
shaped
like
that
of
a
fox
,
and
his
hair
and
beard
were
of
a
reddish
-
tawny
hue
.
<EOS>
His
manner
was
stealthy
,
cowering
,
suspicious
,
as
if
he
feared
a
blow
from
every
hand
.
<EOS>
Yet
Lupo
Vulp
could
show
his
teeth
and
snap
on
occasions
.
<EOS>
He
was
attired
in
a
close
-
fitting
doublet
of
russety
-
brown
,
round
yellow
hose
,
and
long
stockings
of
the
same
hue
.
<EOS>
A
short
brown
mantle
and
a
fox
-
skin
cap
completed
his
costume
.
<EOS>
The
leader
of
the
troop
was
Captain
Bludder
,
a
huge
Alsatian
bully
,
with
fiercely
-
twisted
moustachios
,
and
fiery
-
red
beard
cut
like
a
spade
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
steeple
-
crowned
hat
with
a
brooch
in
it
,
a
buff
jerkin
and
boots
,
and
a
sword
and
buckler
dangled
from
his
waist
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
,
he
had
a
couple
of
petronels
stuck
in
his
girdle
.
<EOS>
The
captain
drank
like
a
fish
,
and
swaggered
and
swore
like
twenty
troopers
.
<EOS>
The
rear
of
the
band
was
formed
by
the
tipstaves
—
stout
fellows
with
hooks
at
the
end
of
their
poles
,
intended
to
capture
a
fugitive
,
or
hale
him
along
when
caught
.
<EOS>
With
these
were
some
others
armed
with
brown
-
bills
.
<EOS>
No
uniformity
prevailed
in
the
accoutrements
of
the
party
,
each
man
arraying
himself
as
he
listed
.
<EOS>
Some
wore
old
leather
jerkins
and
steel
skirts
;
some
,
peascod
doublets
of
Elizabeth
's
time
,
and
trunk
-
hose
that
had
covered
many
a
limb
besides
their
own
;
others
,
slops
and
galligaskins
;
while
the
poorer
sort
were
robed
in
rusty
gowns
of
tuft
-
mockado
or
taffeta
,
once
guarded
with
velvet
or
lined
with
skins
,
but
now
tattered
and
threadbare
.
<EOS>
Their
caps
and
bonnets
were
as
varied
as
their
apparel,—some
being
high
-
crowned
,
some
trencher
-
shaped
,
and
some
few
wide
in
the
leaf
and
looped
at
the
side
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
there
was
every
variety
of
villainous
aspect
;
the
savage
scowl
of
the
desperado
,
the
cunning
leer
of
the
trickster
,
and
the
sordid
look
of
the
mean
knave
.
<EOS>
Several
of
them
betrayed
,
by
the
marks
of
infamy
branded
on
their
faces
,
or
by
the
loss
of
ears
,
that
they
had
passed
through
the
hands
of
the
public
executioner
.
<EOS>
Amongst
these
there
was
one
with
a
visage
more
frightfully
mutilated
than
those
of
his
comrades
;
the
nose
having
been
slit
,
and
subsequently
sewed
together
again
,
but
so
clumsily
that
the
severed
parts
had
only
imperfectly
united
,
communicating
a
strange
,
distorted
,
and
forbidding
look
to
the
physiognomy
.
<EOS>
Clement
Lanyere
,
the
owner
of
this
gashed
and
ghastly
face
,
who
was
also
reft
of
his
ears
,
and
branded
on
the
cheek
,
had
suffered
infamy
and
degradation
,
owing
to
the
licence
he
had
given
his
tongue
in
respect
to
the
Star
-
Chamber
.
<EOS>
Prosecuted
in
that
court
by
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
,
as
a
notorious
libeller
and
scandaller
of
the
judges
and
first
personages
of
the
realm
,
he
was
found
guilty
,
and
sentenced
accordingly
.
<EOS>
The
court
showed
little
leniency
to
such
offenders
;
but
it
was
a
matter
of
grace
that
his
clamorous
tongue
was
not
torn
out
likewise
,
in
addition
to
the
punishment
actually
inflicted
.
<EOS>
A
heavy
fine
and
imprisonment
accompanied
the
corporal
penalties
.
<EOS>
Thus
utterly
ruined
and
degraded
,
and
a
mark
for
the
finger
of
scorn
to
point
at
,
Clement
Lanyere
,
whose
prospects
had
once
been
fair
enough
,
as
his
features
had
been
prepossessing
,
became
soured
and
malevolent
,
embittered
against
the
world
,
and
at
war
with
society
.
<EOS>
He
turned
promoter
,
or
,
in
modern
parlance
,
informer
;
lodging
complaints
,
seeking
out
causes
for
prosecutions
,
and
bringing
people
into
trouble
in
order
to
obtain
part
of
the
forfeits
they
incurred
for
his
pains
.
<EOS>
Strange
to
say
,
he
attached
himself
to
Sir
Giles
<EOS>
Mompesson,—the
cause
of
<EOS>
all
his
misfortunes,—and
became
one
of
the
most
active
and
useful
of
his
followers
.
<EOS>
It
was
thought
no
good
could
come
of
this
alliance
,
and
that
the
promoter
only
bided
his
time
to
turn
upon
his
master
,
against
whom
it
was
only
natural
<EOS>
he
should
nourish
secret
vengeance
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
it
were
so
,
Sir
Giles
seemed
to
entertain
no
apprehensions
of
him
,
probably
thinking
he
could
crush
him
whenever
he
pleased
.
<EOS>
Either
way
the
event
was
long
deferred
.
<EOS>
Clement
Lanyere
,
to
all
appearance
,
continued
to
serve
his
master
zealously
and
well
;
and
Sir
Giles
gave
no
sign
whatever
of
distrust
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
treated
him
with
increased
confidence
.
<EOS>
The
promoter
was
attired
wholly
in
black
—
cloak
,
cap
,
doublet
,
and
hose
were
of
sable
.
<EOS>
And
as
,
owing
to
the
emoluments
springing
from
his
vile
calling
,
his
means
were
far
greater
than
those
of
his
comrades
;
so
his
habiliments
were
better
.
<EOS>
When
wrapped
in
his
mantle
,
with
his
mutilated
countenance
covered
with
a
mask
which
he
generally
wore
,
the
informer
might
have
passed
for
a
cavalier
;
so
tall
and
well
formed
was
his
figure
,
and
so
bold
his
deportment
.
<EOS>
The
dangerous
service
he
was
employed
upon
,
which
exposed
him
to
insult
and
injury
,
required
him
to
be
well
armed
;
and
he
took
care
to
be
so
.
<EOS>
Two
or
three
of
Sir
Giles
's
myrmidons
,
having
been
selected
for
particular
description
,
the
designations
of
some
others
must
suffice
—
such
as
Staring
Hugh
,
a
rascal
of
unmatched
effrontery
;
the
Gib
Cat
and
Cutting
Dick
,
dissolute
rogues
from
the
Pickt
-
hatch
in
Turnbull
Street
,
near
Clerkenwell
;
old
Tom
Wootton
,
once
a
notorious
harbourer
of
"
masterless
men
,
"
at
his
house
at
Smart
's
Quay
,
but
now
a
sheriffs
officer
;
and
,
perhaps
,
it
ought
to
be
mentioned
,
that
there
were
some
half
-
dozen
swash
-
bucklers
and
sharpers
from
Alsatia
,
under
the
command
of
Captain
Bludder
,
who
was
held
responsible
for
their
good
conduct
.
<EOS>
Such
was
Sir
Giles
's
body
-
guard
.
<EOS>
On
his
entrance
,
it
may
be
remarked
,
the
curtain
in
front
of
the
raised
table
was
more
closely
drawn
,
so
as
completely
to
conceal
the
guests
.
<EOS>
But
their
importance
might
be
inferred
from
the
serving
-
men
,
in
rich
liveries
,
standing
before
the
traverse
.
<EOS>
Profound
silence
reigned
throughout
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
Having
uncovered
,
as
before
mentioned
,
and
made
a
formal
reverence
to
the
company
,
Sir
Giles
spoke
as
follows:—"I
crave
your
pardon
,
worthy
Sirs
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
distinct
and
resolute
voice
,
"
for
this
intrusion
,
and
regret
to
be
the
means
of
marring
your
festivity
.
<EOS>
I
came
hither
wholly
unprepared
to
find
such
an
assemblage
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
though
I
would
willingly
have
chosen
a
more
fitting
opportunity
for
my
visit
,
and
would
postpone
,
if
I
could
,
to
another
occasion
,
the
unpleasant
duty
I
have
to
fulfil
;
the
matter
is
urgent
,
and
will
not
admit
of
delay
.
<EOS>
You
will
hold
me
excused
,
therefore
,
if
I
proceed
with
it
,
regardless
of
your
presence
;
and
I
am
well
assured
<EOS>
no
let
or
interruption
will
be
offered
me
,
seeing
I
act
with
the
royal
licence
and
authority
,
of
which
I
am
the
unworthy
representative
.
<EOS>
""Truly
,
your
conduct
requires
explanation
,
"
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
cried
,
in
a
mocking
tone
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
not
been
here
in
London
,
I
should
have
judged
,
from
your
appearance
,
and
that
of
your
attendants
,
that
a
band
of
desperate
marauders
had
broken
in
upon
us
,
and
that
we
must
draw
our
swords
to
defend
our
lives
,
and
save
the
house
from
pillage
.
<EOS>
But
after
what
you
have
said
,
I
conclude
you
to
be
the
sheriff
,
come
with
your
followers
to
execute
some
writ
of
attachment
;
and
therefore
,
however
annoying
the
presence
of
such
a
functionary
may
be,—however
ill
-
timed
may
be
your
visit
,
and
unmannerly
your
deportment,—we
are
bound
not
to
molest
you
.
<EOS>
"Provocation
<EOS>
like
this
was
rarely
addressed
to
Sir
Giles
;
and
the
choler
occasioned
by
it
was
increased
by
the
laughter
and
cheers
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
he
constrained
his
anger
,
replying
in
a
stern
,
scornful
tone—"I
would
not
counsel
you
to
molest
me
,
young
man
.
<EOS>
The
mistake
you
have
committed
in
regard
to
myself
may
be
pardoned
in
one
of
your
evident
inexperience
;
who
,
fresh
from
the
boorish
society
of
the
country
,
finds
himself
,
for
the
first
time
,
amongst
well
-
bred
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
Of
all
here
present
<EOS>
you
are
probably
the
sole
person
ignorant
that
I
am
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
scarcely
likely
that
they
should
be
aware
,
as
I
chance
to
be
,
that
the
clownish
insolent
who
has
dared
to
wag
his
tongue
against
me
,
is
the
son
of
a
Star
-
Chamber
delinquent

"CHAPTER
<EOS>
IX.The
Letters
-
Patent
.
<EOS>
A
slight
reaction
in
Sir
Giles
's
favour
was
produced
by
his
speech
,
but
Jocelyn
quite
regained
his
position
with
the
company
when
he
exclaimed—"My
father
was
misjudged
.
<EOS>
His
prosecutor
was
a
villain
,
and
his
sentence
iniquitous
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
uttered
your
own
condemnation
,
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
,
"
Sir
Giles
cried
,
with
a
savage
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
Know
,
to
your
confusion
,
that
the
High
Court
of
Star
-
Chamber
is
so
tender
of
upholding
the
honour
of
its
sentences
,
that
it
ever
punishes
such
as
speak
against
them
with
the
greatest
severity
.
<EOS>
You
have
uttered
your
scandals
openly
.
<EOS>
""Imprudent
<EOS>
young
man
,
you
have
,
indeed
,
placed
yourself
in
fearful
jeopardy
,
"
a
gentleman
near
him
observed
to
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"
Escape
,
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
You
are
lost
,
if
you
remain
here
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
instead
of
following
the
friendly
advice
,
Jocelyn
would
have
assaulted
Sir
Giles
,
if
he
had
not
been
forcibly
withheld
by
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
The
knight
was
not
slow
to
follow
up
the
advantage
he
had
gained
.
<EOS>
"Stand
<EOS>
forward
,
Clement
Lanyere
,
"
he
exclaimed
,
authoritatively
.
<EOS>
The
promoter
instantly
advanced
.
<EOS>
"Look
<EOS>
at
this
man
,
"
Sir
Giles
continued
,
addressing
Jocelyn
;
"
and
you
will
perceive
how
those
who
malign
the
Star
-
Chamber
are
treated
.
<EOS>
This
disfigured
countenance
was
once
as
free
from
seam
or
scar
as
your
own
;
and
yet
,
for
an
offence
lighter
than
yours
,
it
hath
been
stamped
,
as
you
see
,
with
indelible
infamy
.
<EOS>
Answer
,
Clement
Lanyere,—and
answer
according
to
your
conscience,—Was
the
sentence
just
of
the
high
and
honourable
court
by
which
you
were
tried?""It
was
just
,
"
the
promoter
replied
,
a
deep
flush
dyeing
his
ghastly
visage
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
lenient?""Most
lenient
.
<EOS>
For
it
left
my
foul
tongue
the
power
of
speech
it
now
enjoys
.
<EOS>
""By
<EOS>
whom
were
you
prosecuted
in
the
Star
-
Chamber?""By
<EOS>
him
I
now
serve
.
<EOS>
""That
is
,
by
myself
.
<EOS>
Do
you
bear
me
malice
for
what
I
did?""I
have
never
said
so
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
Sir
Giles
,
I
have
always
declared
I
owe
you
a
deep
debt
.
<EOS>
""Which
<EOS>
you
strive
to
pay?""Which
<EOS>
I
will
pay
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
hear
what
this
man
says
,
Mounchensey
?
"
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
cried
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
guilty
of
the
same
offence
as
he
.
<EOS>
Why
should
you
not
be
similarly
<EOS>
punished?""If
<EOS>
I
were
so
punished
,
I
would
stab
my
prosecutor
to
the
heart
,
"
Jocelyn
replied
.
<EOS>
At
this
rejoinder
,
Lanyere
,
who
had
hitherto
kept
his
eyes
on
the
ground
,
suddenly
raised
them
,
with
a
look
of
singular
expression
at
the
speaker
.
<EOS>
"Humph
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
ejaculated
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
proceed
to
extremities
with
him
,
I
find
.
<EOS>
Keep
strict
watch
upon
him
,
Lanyere
;
and
follow
him
if
he
goes
forth
.
<EOS>
Trace
him
to
his
lair
.
<EOS>
Now
to
business
.
<EOS>
Give
me
the
letters
-
patent
,
Lupo
,
"
he
added
,
turning
to
the
scrivener
,
as
Lanyere
retired
.
"
<EOS>
These
Letters
-
Patent
,
"
continued
Sir
Giles
,
taking
two
parchment
scrolls
with
large
seals
pendent
from
them
from
Lupo
Vulp
,
and
displaying
them
to
the
assemblage
,
"
these
Royal
Letters
,
"
he
repeated
in
his
steady
,
stern
tones
,
and
glancing
round
with
a
look
of
half
-
defiance
,
"
passed
under
the
great
seal
,
and
bearing
the
king
's
sign
-
manual
,
as
ye
see
,
gentlemen
,
constitute
the
authority
on
which
I
act
.
<EOS>
They
accord
to
me
and
my
co
-
patentee
,
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
,
absolute
and
uncontrolled
power
and
discretion
in
granting
and
refusing
licenses
to
all
tavern
-
keepers
and
hostel
-
keepers
throughout
London
.
<EOS>
They
give
us
full
power
to
enter
and
inspect
all
taverns
and
hostels
,
at
any
time
that
may
seem
fit
to
us
;
to
prevent
any
unlawful
games
being
used
therein
;
and
to
see
that
good
order
and
rule
be
maintained
.
<EOS>
They
also
render
it
compulsory
upon
all
ale
-
house
-
keepers
,
tavern
-
keepers
,
and
inn
-
keepers
throughout
London
,
to
enter
into
their
own
recognizances
with
us
against
the
non
-
observance
of
our
rules
and
regulations
for
their
governance
and
maintenance
,
and
to
find
two
sureties
:
and
in
case
of
the
forfeiture
of
such
recognizances
by
any
act
of
the
parties
,
coming
within
the
scope
of
our
authority
,
it
is
provided
that
one
moiety
of
the
sum
forfeited
be
paid
to
the
Crown
,
and
the
other
moiety
to
us
.
<EOS>
Lend
me
your
ears
yet
further
,
I
pray
ye
,
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
These
Royal
Letters
empower
us
to
inflict
certain
fines
and
penalties
upon
all
such
as
offend
against
our
authority
,
or
resist
our
claims
;
and
they
enable
us
to
apprehend
and
commit
to
prison
such
offenders
without
further
warrant
than
the
letters
themselves
contain
.
<EOS>
In
brief
,
gentlemen
,
"
he
continued
in
a
peremptory
tone
,
as
if
insisting
upon
attention
,
"
you
will
observe
,
that
the
absolute
control
of
all
houses
of
entertainment
,
where
exciseable
liquors
are
vended
,
is
delegated
to
us
by
his
most
gracious
Majesty
,
King
James
.
<EOS>
To
which
end
ample
powers
have
been
given
us
by
his
Majesty
,
who
has
armed
us
with
the
strong
arm
of
the
law
.
<EOS>
Will
it
please
ye
to
inspect
the
letters
,
gentlemen
?
"
<EOS>
holding
them
forth
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
that
his
Majesty
hath
thus
written;—'In
cujus
rei
testimonium
has
Literas
nostras
fieri
fecimus
patentes
.
<EOS>
Teste
Meipso
,
apud
Westm
.
<EOS>
10
die
Maij
,
Anno
Regni
nostri
,
'
etc
.
<EOS>
Then
follows
the
royal
signature
.
<EOS>
None
of
ye
,
I
presume
,
will
question
its
authenticity?"IllustrationA
deep
silence
succeeded
,
in
the
midst
of
which
<EOS>
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
broke
forth:—"I
,
for
one
,
question
it
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
believe
that
a
king
,
who
,
like
our
gracious
sovereign
,
has
the
welfare
of
his
subjects
at
heart
,
would
sanction
the
oppression
and
injustice
which
those
warrants
,
if
entrusted
to
unscrupulous
hands
,
must
inevitably
accomplish
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
mistrust
the
genuineness
of
the
signature
.
<EOS>
If
not
forged
,
it
has
been
obtained
by
fraud
or
misrepresentation
.
<EOS>
"Some
murmurs
of
applause
followed
this
bold
speech
;
but
the
gentleman
who
had
previously
counselled
the
young
man
again
interposed
,
and
whispered
these
words
in
his
ear:—"Your
rash
vehemence
will
undo
you
,
if
you
take
not
heed
.
<EOS>
Beyond
question
,
Sir
Giles
hath
the
king
's
sanction
for
what
he
does
,
and
to
censure
him
as
you
have
done
is
to
censure
the
Crown
,
which
is
next
to
treason
.
<EOS>
Be
ruled
by
me
,
my
good
young
Sir
,
and
meddle
no
more
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"Sir
<EOS>
Giles
,
who
had
some
difficulty
in
controlling
his
choler
,
now
spoke:—"You
have
cast
an
imputation
upon
me
,
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
,
"
he
cried
with
concentrated
fury
,
"
which
you
shall
be
compelled
to
retract
as
publicly
as
you
have
made
it
.
<EOS>
To
insult
an
officer
of
the
Crown
,
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
,
is
to
insult
the
Crown
itself
,
as
you
will
find
.
<EOS>
In
the
King
's
name
,
I
command
you
to
hold
your
peace
,
or
,
in
the
King
's
name
,
I
will
instantly
arrest
you
;
and
I
forbid
any
one
to
give
you
aid
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
be
troubled
thus
.
<EOS>
Appointed
by
his
Majesty
to
a
certain
office
,
I
exercise
it
as
much
for
the
benefit
of
the
Royal
Exchequer
,
as
for
my
own
personal
advantage
.
<EOS>
I
have
his
Majesty
's
full
approval
of
what
I
do
,
and
I
need
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
I
am
accountable
to
no
man
—
save
the
King
,
"
addressing
this
menace
as
much
to
the
rest
of
the
company
as
to
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
came
not
here
to
render
explanation
,
but
to
act
.
<EOS>
What
,
ho
!
<EOS>
Madame
Bonaventure
!
<EOS>
Where
are
ye
,
Madame
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
are
here!""Bon
jour
,
sweet
Sir
Giles
,
"
the
landlady
said
,
making
him
a
profound
obeisance
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
pleasure
with
me
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
And
to
what
am
I
to
attribute
the
honour
of
this
visit?""Tut
!
<EOS>
Madame
.
<EOS>
You
know
well
enough
what
brings
me
hither
,
and
thus
attended
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
come
in
pursuance
of
a
notice
,
served
upon
you
a
month
ago
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
deny
having
received
it
,
since
the
officer
who
placed
it
in
your
hands
is
here
present
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
indicated
Clement
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
"Au
<EOS>
contraire
,
Sir
Giles
,
"
Madame
Bonaventure
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
readily
admit
the
receipt
of
a
written
message
from
you
,
which
,
though
scarcely
intelligible
to
my
poor
comprehension
,
did
not
seem
as
agreeably
worded
as
a
billet
-
doux
.
<EOS>
Mais
,
ma
foi
!
<EOS>
I
attached
little
importance
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
suppose
it
possible
—
nor
do
I
suppose
it
possible
now"—with
<EOS>
a
captivating
smile
,
which
was
totally
lost
upon
Sir
Giles—"that
you
could
adopt
such
rigorous
measures
against
me
.
<EOS>
""My
measures
may
appear
rigorous
,
Madame
,
"
Sir
Giles
coldly
replied
;
"
but
I
am
warranted
in
taking
them
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
am
compelled
to
take
them
.
<EOS>
Not
having
made
the
satisfaction
required
by
the
notice
,
you
have
deprived
yourself
of
the
protection
I
was
willing
to
afford
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
now
merely
your
judge
.
<EOS>
The
penalties
incurred
by
your
neglect
are
these
:
Your
licence
was
suspended
a
month
ago
;
the
notice
expressly
stating
that
it
would
be
withdrawn
,
unless
certain
conditions
were
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
Consequently
,
as
ever
since
that
time
you
have
been
vending
exciseable
liquors
without
lawful
permission
,
you
have
incurred
a
fine
of
one
hundred
marks
a
day
,
making
a
total
of
three
thousand
marks
now
due
and
owing
from
you
,
partly
to
his
Majesty
,
and
partly
to
his
Majesty
's
representatives
.
<EOS>
This
sum
I
now
demand
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
Dieu
!
<EOS>
three
thousand
marks
!
"
<EOS>
Madame
Bonaventure
screamed
.
<EOS>
"
What
robbery
is
this!—what
barbarity
!
'
<EOS>
T
is
ruin
—
utter
ruin
!
<EOS>
I
may
as
well
close
my
house
altogether
,
and
return
to
my
own
fair
country
.
<EOS>
As
I
am
an
honest
woman
,
Sir
Giles
,
I
can
not
pay
it
.
<EOS>
So
it
is
quite
useless
on
your
part
to
make
any
such
demand
.
""You
<EOS>
profess
inability
to
pay
,
Madame
<EOS>
,
"
Sir
Giles
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
believe
you
;
having
some
knowledge
of
your
means
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
will
acquaint
you
with
a
rule
of
law
applicable
to
the
contingency
you
put
.
'
<EOS>
Quod
non
habet
in
cere
,
luet
in
corpore
'
is
a
decree
of
the
Star
-
Chamber
;
meaning
,
for
I
do
not
expect
you
to
understand
Latin
,
that
he
who
can
not
pay
in
purse
shall
pay
in
person
.
<EOS>
Aware
of
the
alternative
,
you
will
make
your
choice
.
<EOS>
And
you
may
thank
me
that
I
have
not
adjudged
you
at
once
—
as
I
have
the
power
—
to
three
months
within
the
Wood
Street
Compter
.
<EOS>
""Ah
,
Sir
Giles
!
<EOS>
what
an
atrocious
idea
.
<EOS>
You
are
worse
than
a
savage
to
talk
of
such
a
loathsome
prison
to
me
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
mon
Dieu
!
<EOS>
what
is
to
happen
to
me
!
<EOS>
would
I
were
back
again
in
my
lovely
Bordeaux!""You
will
have
an
opportunity
of
revisiting
that
fine
city
,
Madame
;
for
you
will
no
longer
be
able
to
carry
on
your
calling
here
.
<EOS>
""Ciel
!
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
!
<EOS>
what
mean
<EOS>
you?""I
mean
,
Madame
,
that
you
are
disabled
from
keeping
any
tavern
for
the
space
of
three
years
.
<EOS>
"Madame
<EOS>
Bonaventure
clasped
her
hands
together
,
and
screamed
aloud
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
pity
,
Sir
Giles!—In
pity
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
<EOS>
The
inexorable
knight
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
The
low
murmurs
of
indignation
among
the
company
which
had
been
gradually
gathering
force
during
the
foregoing
dialogue
,
now
became
clamorous
.
<EOS>
"
A
most
scandalous
proceeding
!
"
exclaimed
one
.
"
<EOS>
Deprive
us
of
our
best
French
ordinary
!
"
cried
another
.
"
<EOS>
Infamous
extortioner
!
"
shouted
a
third
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
not
permit
such
injustice
.
<EOS>
Let
us
take
the
law
into
our
own
hands
,
and
settle
the
question
!
<EOS>
"
shouted
a
fourth
.
"
<EOS>
Ay
,
down
with
the
knight
!
"
added
a
fifth
.
<EOS>
But
Sir
Giles
continued
perfectly
unmoved
by
the
tempest
raging
around
,
and
laughed
to
scorn
these
menaces
,
contenting
himself
with
signing
to
Captain
Bludder
to
be
in
readiness
.
<EOS>
"A
truce
to
this
,
gentlemen
;
"
he
at
length
thundered
forth
;
"
the
King
's
warrant
must
be
respected
.
<EOS>
"Again
<EOS>
Madame
Bonaventure
besought
his
pity
,
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
She
took
hold
of
his
arm
,
and
feigned
to
kneel
to
him
;
but
he
shook
her
coldly
off
.
<EOS>
"You
are
a
very
charming
woman
,
no
doubt
,
Madame
,
"
he
said
sarcastically
;
"
and
some
men
might
find
you
irresistible
;
but
I
am
not
made
of
such
yielding
stuff
,
and
you
may
spare
yourself
further
trouble
,
for
all
your
powers
of
persuasion
will
fail
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
renew
my
demand
—
and
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
Do
not
compel
me
to
resort
to
extremities
with
you
.
<EOS>
It
would
grieve
me
,
"
he
added
with
a
bitter
smile
,
"
to
drag
so
pretty
a
woman
through
the
public
streets
,
like
a
common
debtor
,
to
the
Compter
.
<EOS>
""Grace
!
<EOS>
grace
!
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
,
"
cried
Madame
Bonaventure
.
<EOS>
Then
seeing
him
remain
inflexible
,
she
added
,
in
an
altered
tone
,
"
I
will
never
submit
with
life
to
such
an
indignity
—
<EOS>
never!""We'll
all
protect
you
,
Madame
,
"
cried
the
assemblage
with
one
voice—"Let
him
lay
hands
upon
you
,
and
he
shall
see
.
<EOS>
"Sir
<EOS>
Giles
glanced
at
his
myrmidons
.
<EOS>
They
stepped
quickly
towards
him
in
a
body
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
,
whom
no
efforts
of
the
friendly
gentleman
could
now
restrain
,
sprang
forward
,
and
,
drawing
his
sword
,
was
just
in
time
to
place
himself
before
Madame
Bonaventure
,
as
she
drew
hastily
back
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
no
fear
,
Madame
<EOS>
,
you
are
safe
with
me
,
"
the
young
man
said
,
glancing
fiercely
at
the
knight
and
his
troop
.
<EOS>
The
greatest
confusion
now
reigned
throughout
the
room
.
<EOS>
Other
swords
were
drawn
,
and
several
of
the
guests
mounted
upon
the
benches
to
overlook
the
scene
.
<EOS>
Cyprien
,
and
the
rest
of
the
drawers
and
tradesmen
ranged
themselves
behind
their
mistress
,
prepared
to
resist
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
myrmidons
to
seize
her
.
<EOS>
The
curtain
at
the
head
of
the
room
was
partly
drawn
aside
,
showing
that
the
distinguished
persons
at
the
upper
table
were
equally
excited
.
<EOS>
"Gentlemen
,
"
Sir
Giles
said
,
still
maintaining
perfect
calmness
in
the
midst
of
the
tumult
,
"
a
word
with
you
ere
it
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
address
myself
to
you
,
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
,
for
you
are
undeserving
of
any
friendly
consideration
—
but
to
all
others
I
would
counsel
forbearance
and
non
-
resistance
.
<EOS>
Deliver
up
that
woman
to
me
.
<EOS>
""I
will
die
upon
the
spot
sooner
than
you
shall
be
surrendered
,
"
said
Jocelyn
,
encouraging
the
hostess
,
who
clung
to
his
disengaged
arm
.
<EOS>
"Oh
!
<EOS>
merci
!
<EOS>
grand
merci
,
mon
beau
gentilhomme
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"Am
<EOS>
I
to
understand
then
,
that
you
mean
to
impede
me
in
the
lawful
execution
of
my
purposes
,
gentlemen
?
"
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
demanded
.
<EOS>
"We
mean
to
prevent
an
unlawful
arrest
,
"
several
voices
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"Be
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
so
,
"
the
knight
said
;
"
I
wash
my
hands
of
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
his
followers
,
he
added—"Officers
,
at
all
hazards
,
attach
the
person
of
Dameris
Bonaventure
,
and
convey
her
to
the
Compter
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
arrest
the
young
man
-
beside
her
—
Jocelyn
Mounchensey,—who
has
uttered
treasonable
language
against
our
sovereign
lord
the
King
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
how
to
dispose
of
him
anon
.
<EOS>
Do
my
bidding
at
once
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
ere
<EOS>
the
order
could
be
obeyed
,
the
authoritative
voice
which
had
previously
been
heard
from
the
upper
table
exclaimed—"Hold!"Sir
Giles
paused
;
looked
irresolute
for
a
minute
;
and
then
checked
his
myrmidons
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
.
<EOS>
"Who
<EOS>
is
it
stays
the
law
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
,
with
the
glare
of
a
tiger
from
whom
a
bone
has
been
snatched
.
<EOS>
"One
<EOS>
you
must
needs
obey
,
Sir
Giles
,
"
replied
Lord
Roos
,
coming
towards
him
from
the
upper
table
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
unconsciously
played
a
part
in
a
comedy
—
and
played
it
very
well
,
too
—
but
it
is
time
to
bring
the
piece
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
We
are
fast
verging
on
the
confines
of
tragedy
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
understand
you
,
my
lord
,
"
Sir
Giles
returned
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
I
discern
nothing
comic
in
the
matter
;
though
much
of
serious
import
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
do
not
perceive
the
comedy
,
because
it
has
been
part
of
our
scheme
to
keep
you
in
the
dark
,
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
there
is
a
scheme
,
then
,
a
-
foot
here
,
my
lord?—ha!""A
little
merry
plot
;
nothing
more
,
Sir
Giles
—
in
the
working
of
which
your
worthy
co
-
patentee
,
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
,
has
materially
assisted
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Sir
Giles
,
glancing
at
his
partner
,
who
still
occupied
his
elevated
position
upon
the
table—"I
presume
,
then
,
I
have
to
thank
you
,
my
lord
,
for
the
indignity
offered
to
my
friend?""As
<EOS>
you
please
,
Sir
Giles
,
"
Lord
Roos
returned
carelessly
.
<EOS>
"
You
call
it
an
indignity
;
but
in
my
opinion
the
best
thing
to
be
done
with
a
man
whose
head
so
swims
with
wine
that
his
legs
refuse
to
support
him
,
is
to
tie
him
in
a
chair
.
<EOS>
He
may
else
sacrifice
his
dignity
by
rolling
under
the
table
.
<EOS>
But
let
this
pass
for
the
nonce
.
<EOS>
Before
Sir
Francis
was
wholly
overcome
,
he
was
good
enough
to
give
me
his
signature
.
<EOS>
You
saw
him
do
it
,
gentlemen
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
appealing
to
the
company
.
<EOS>
"Yes
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
yes!—we
saw
him
write
it
!
"
was
the
general
reply
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
to
what
end
was
this
done
,
my
lord
?
"
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
demanded
,
sternly
.
"To
<EOS>
enable
me
,
"
replied
the
imperturbable
young
nobleman
,
"
to
draw
out
a
receipt
in
full
of
your
joint
claims
against
Madame
Bonaventure
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
it
,
Sir
Giles
;
and
here
it
is
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
taken
care
to
grant
a
renewal
of
her
licence
from
the
date
of
your
notice
;
so
that
no
penalties
or
fines
can
attach
to
her
for
neglect
.
<EOS>
Take
it
,
Madame
Bonaventure
<EOS>
"
he
continued
,
handing
her
the
paper
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
your
full
acquittance
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
think
you
,
my
lord
,
that
this
shallow
artifice
—
to
give
it
no
harsher
term
—
will
avail
you
any
thing
?
"
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
cried
scornfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
set
it
aside
at
once
.
<EOS>
""Your
pardon
,
Sir
Giles
;
you
will
do
no
such
thing

<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
who
will
hinder
me?—You
,
my
lord?""Even
<EOS>
I
,
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
Proceed
at
your
peril
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
young
nobleman
's
assurance
staggered
his
opponent
.
<EOS>
"He
must
have
some
one
to
uphold
him
,
or
he
would
not
be
thus
confident
,
"
he
thought
.
<EOS>
"
Whose
was
the
voice
I
heard
?
<EOS>
It
sounded
like
—
No
matter
!
'
<EOS>
Tis
needful
to
be
cautious
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
do
not
,
then
,
hold
yourself
bound
by
the
acts
of
your
partner
,
Sir
Giles
?
"
<EOS>
Lord
Roos
said
.
<EOS>
"I
deny
this
to
be
his
act
,
"
the
knight
replied
.
<EOS>
"Better
<EOS>
question
him
at
once
on
the
subject
,
"
Lord
Roos
said
.
<EOS>
"
Set
him
free
,
Cyprien
.
"The
<EOS>
Gascon
did
as
he
was
bidden
,
and
with
the
aid
of
his
fellow
drawers
,
helped
Sir
Francis
from
the
table
.
<EOS>
To
the
surprise
of
the
company
,
the
knight
then
managed
to
stagger
forward
unassisted
,
and
would
have
embraced
Sir
Giles
,
if
the
latter
had
not
thrust
him
off
in
disgust
,
with
some
violence
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
folly
is
this
,
Sir
Francis
?
"
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
cried
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
forgotten
yourself
strangely
,
you
have
taken
leave
of
your
senses
,
methinks!""Not
a

of
it
,
Sir
Giles
—
not
a
whit

<EOS>
I
never
was
more
my
own
master
than
I
am
at
present
,
as
I
will
prove
to
you
.
<EOS>
""Prove
<EOS>
it
,
then
,
by
explaining
how
you
came
to
sign
that
paper

<EOS>
You
could
not
mean
to
run
counter
to
me?""But
<EOS>
I
did
,
"
Sir
Francis
rejoined
,
highly
offended
.
<EOS>
"
I
meant
to
run
counter
to
you
in
signing
it
,
and
I
mean
it
now
.
""'Sdeath
!
<EOS>
you
besotted
fool
,
you
are
playing
into
their
hands!""Besotted
fool
in
your
teeth

Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
I
am
as
sober
as
yourself
.
<EOS>
My
hand
has
been
put
to
that
paper
,
and
what
it
contains
I
stand
by
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
design
,
then
,
to
acquit
Madame
Bonaventure
?
<EOS>
Consider
what
you
say?""No
need
for
consideration
;
I
have
always
designed
it
.
<EOS>
""Ten
thousand
thanks
,
Sir
Francis
!
"
<EOS>
the
hostess
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
I
had
an
excellent
friend
in
you
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
enamoured
knight
seized
the
hand
she
extended
towards
him
,
but
in
the
attempt
to
kiss
it
fell
to
the
ground
,
amid
the
laughter
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
"Are
<EOS>
you
satisfied
now
,
Sir
Giles
?
"
asked
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
"I
am
satisfied
that
Sir
Francis
has
been
duped
,
"
he
replied
,
"
and
that
when
his
brain
is
free
from
the
fumes
of
wine
,
he
will
bitterly
regret
his
folly
.
<EOS>
But
even
his
discharge
will
be
insufficient
.
<EOS>
Though
it
may
bind
me
,
it
will
not
bind
the
Crown
,
which
will
yet
enforce
its
claims
.
<EOS>
""That
,
Sir
Giles
,
I
leave
competent
authority
to
decide
,
"
Lord
Roos
replied
,
retiring
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
withdrew
,
the
curtains
before
the
upper
table
were
entirely
withdrawn
,
disclosing
the
whole
of
the
brilliant
assemblage
,
and
at
the
head
of
them
one
person
far
more
brilliant
and
distinguished
than
the
rest
.
"Buckingham
!
"
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
knew
the
voice
.
<EOS>
"It
was
,
indeed
,
the
King
's
omnipotent
favourite
.
<EOS>
Magnificently
attired
,
the
Marquis
of
Buckingham
as
far
outshone
his
companions
in
splendour
of
habiliments
as
he
did
in
stateliness
of
carriage
and
beauty
of
person
.
<EOS>
Rising
from
the
table
,
and
donning
his
plumed
hat
,
looped
with
diamonds
,
with
a
gesture
worthy
of
a
monarch
,
while
all
the
rest
remained
uncovered
,
as
if
in
recognition
of
his
superior
dignity
,
he
descended
to
where
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
was
standing
.
<EOS>
It
need
scarcely
be
said
that
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
had
never
seen
the
superb
favourite
before
;
but
he
did
not
require
to
be
told
whom
he
beheld
,
so
perfectly
did
Buckingham
realize
the
descriptions
given
of
him
.
<EOS>
A
little
above
the
ordinary
height
,
with
a
figure
of
the
most
perfect
symmetry
,
and
features
as
aristocratic
and
haughty
as
handsome
,
it
was
impossible
to
conceive
a
prouder
or
a
nobler
-
looking
personage
than
the
marquis
.
<EOS>
His
costume
was
splendid
,
consisting
of
a
doublet
of
white
cut
velvet
,
roped
with
pearls
,
which
fitted
him
to
admiration
.
<EOS>
Over
his
shoulders
he
wore
a
mantle
of
watchet
-
coloured
velvet
;
his
neck
was
encircled
by
a
falling
band
;
and
silken
hose
of
the
same
colour
as
the
doublet
completed
his
costume
.
<EOS>
His
deportment
was
singularly
dignified
;
but
his
manner
might
have
conciliated
more
if
it
had
been
less
imperious
and
disdainful
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
made
a
profound
obeisance
as
Buckingham
advanced
towards
him
.
<EOS>
His
salutation
was
haughtily
returned
.
<EOS>
"I
have
heard
something
of
your
mode
of
proceeding
with
the
keepers
of
taverns
and
hostels
,
Sir
Giles
,
"
the
proud
marquis
said
;
"
but
this
is
the
first
occasion
on
which
I
have
seen
it
put
in
practice,—and
<EOS>
I
am
free
to
confess
that
you
deal
not
over
gently
with
them
,
if
the
present
may
be
considered
a
specimen
of
your
ordinary
conduct
.
<EOS>
Those
letters
-
patent
were
not
confided
to
you
by
his
Majesty
to
distress
his
subjects
,
for
your
own
particular
advantage
and
profit
,
but
to
benefit
the
community
by
keeping
such
places
of
entertainment
in
better
order
than
heretofore
.
<EOS>
I
fear
you
have
somewhat
abused
your
warrant
,
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
""If
to
devote
myself
,
heart
and
soul
,
to
his
Majesty
's
service
,
and
to
enrich
his
Majesty
's
exchequer
be
to
abuse
my
warrant
,
I
have
done
so
,
my
lord
Marquis,—but
not
otherwise
.
<EOS>
I
have
ever
vindicated
the
dignity
and
authority
of
the
Crown
.
<EOS>
You
have
just
heard
that
,
though
my
own
just
claims
have
been
defeated
by
the
inadvertence
of
my
co
-
patentee
,
I
have
advanced
those
of
the
King
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
King
relinquishes
all
claims
in
the
present
case
,
"
Buckingham
replied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
gracious
Majesty
gave
me
full
discretion
in
the
matter
,
and
I
act
as
I
know
he
himself
would
have
acted
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
waving
his
hand
to
signify
that
he
would
listen
to
no
remonstrances
,
the
Marquis
turned
to
Madame
Bonaventure
,
who
instantly
prostrated
herself
before
him
,
as
she
would
have
done
before
royalty
itself
,
warmly
thanking
him
for
his
protection
.
<EOS>
"You
must
thank
my
Lord
Roos
,
and
not
me
,
Madame
,
"
Buckingham
graciously
replied
,
raising
her
as
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
at
his
lordship
's
instance
I
came
here
.
<EOS>
He
takes
a
warm
interest
in
you
,
Madame
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
shall
ever
be
beholden
to
his
lordship
,
I
am
sure
,
"
Madame
Bonaventure
said
,
casting
down
her
eyes
and
blushing
,
or
feigning
to
blush
,
"
as
well
as
to
you
,
Monseigneur
.
""My
<EOS>
Lord
Roos
avouched
,
"
pursued
Buckingham
,
"
that
at
the
Three
Cranes
I
should
find
the
prettiest
hostess
and
the
best
wine
in
London
;
and
on
my
faith
as
a
gentleman
!
<EOS>
I
must
say
he
was
wrong
in
neither
particular

<EOS>
Brighter
eyes
I
have
never
beheld

rarer
claret
I
have
never
drunk

<EOS>
""Oh
,
Monseigneur
!

quite
overwhelm
me

<EOS>
My
poor
house
can
scarcely
hope
to
be
honoured
a
second
time
with
such
a
presence
;
but
should
it
so
chance"—"You
will
give

good
welcome

Sir
Giles
Mompesson!""My

<EOS>
""I
lay
my
commands
upon
you
,
good
Sir
Giles
,
that
no
further
molestation
be
offered
to
Madame
Bonaventure
,
but
that
you
give
a
good
report
of
her
house

<EOS>
Withdraw
your
followers
without
delay
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
commands
shall
be
obeyed

my
lord
Marquis

"
Sir
Giles
rejoined
;
"
but
before
I
go
I
have
an
arrest
to
make
.
<EOS>
That
young
man
,
"
pointing
to
Jocelyn
,
"
has
been
talking
treason
.
<EOS>
""It
is
false
,
my
lord
Marquis
,
"
Jocelyn
replied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
Majesty
hath
not
a
more
loyal
subject
than
myself
.
<EOS>
I
would
cut
out
my
tongue
rather
than
speak
against
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
said
the
King
is
ill
served
in
such
officers
as
Giles
Mompesson
and
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
,
and
I
abide
by
my
words
.
<EOS>
They
can
reflect
no
dishonour
on
his
Majesty
.
<EOS>
""Save
that
they
seem
to
imply
a
belief
on
your
part
that
his
Majesty
has
chosen
his
officers
badly
<EOS>
,
"
Buckingham
said
,
regarding
the
young
man
fixedly
.
"Not
<EOS>
so
,
my
lord
Marquis
,
These
men
may
have
been
favourably
represented
to
his
Majesty
,
who
no
doubt
has
been
kept
in
ignorance
of
their
iniquitous
proceedings
.
<EOS>
""What
are
you
driving
at
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
Buckingham
cried
,
almost
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
mean
,
my
lord
Marquis
,
that
these
persons
may
be
the
creatures
of
some
powerful
noble
,
whose
interest
it
is
to
throw
a
cloak
over
their
malpractices
.
<EOS>
""'Fore
<EOS>
heaven
!
<EOS>
some
covert
insult
would
seem
to
be
intended
,
"
exclaimed
Buckingham
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
this
young
man
,
Sir
Giles?""He
is
named
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
,
my
lord
Marquis
;
and
is
the
son
of
an
old
Norfolk
knight
baronet
,
who
,
you
may
remember
,
was
arraigned
before
the
Court
of
Star
-
Chamber
,
heavily
fined
,
and
imprisoned
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do
remember
the
case
,
and
the
share
you
and
Sir
Francis
had
in
it
,
Sir
Giles
,
"
Buckingham
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"I
am
right
glad
to
hear
that
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
then
wonder
that
I
avow
myself
their
mortal
enemy
.
<EOS>
""We
laugh
to
scorn
these
idle
vapourings
,
"
said
Sir
Giles
;
"
and
were
it
permitted
,
"
he
added
,
touching
his
sword
,
"
I
myself
would
find
an
easy
way
to
silence
them
.
<EOS>
But
the
froward
youth
,
whose
brains
seem
crazed
with
his
fancied
wrongs
,
is
not
content
with
railing
against
us
,
but
must
needs
lift
up
his
voice
against
all
constituted
authority
.
<EOS>
He
hath
spoken
contemptuously
of
the
Star
-
Chamber,—and
that
,
my
lord
Marquis
,
as
you
well
know
,
is
an
offence
,
which
can
not
be
passed
over
.
<EOS>
""I
am
sorry
for
it
,
"
Buckingham
rejoined
;
"
but
if
he
will
retract
what
he
has
said
,
and
express
compunction
,
with
promise
of
amendment
in
future
,
I
will
exert
my
influence
to
have
him
held
harmless
.
<EOS>
""I
will
never
retract
what
I
have
said
against
that
iniquitous
tribunal
,
"
Jocelyn
rejoined
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
rather
die
a
martyr
,
as
my
father
did
,
in
the
cause
of
truth
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
kindness
is
altogether
thrown
away
upon
him
,
my
lord
,
"
Sir
Giles
said
,
with
secret
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
I
perceive
,
"
Buckingham
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
Our
business
is
over
,
"
he
added
,
to
the
nobles
and
gallants
around
him
;
"
so
we
may
to
our
barges
.
<EOS>
You
,
my
lord
,
"
he
added
to
Lord
Roos
,
"
will
doubtless
tarry
to
receive
the
thanks
of
our
pretty
hostess
.
"And
<EOS>
graciously
saluting
Madame
Bonaventure
,
he
quitted
the
tavern
accompanied
by
a
large
train
,
and
entering
his
barge
amid
the
acclamations
of
the
spectators
,
was
rowed
towards
Whitehall
.

CHAPTER
X.The
'
Prentices
and
Their
Leader
.
<EOS>
While
the
Marquis
of
Buckingham
and
his
suite
were
moving
towards
the
wharf
,
amid
the
acclamations
of
the
crowd
(
for
in
the
early
part
of
his
brilliant
career
the
haughty
favourite
was
extremely
popular
with
the
multitude
,
probably
owing
to
the
princely
largesses
he
was
in
the
habit
of
distributing
among
them
)
,
a
very
different
reception
awaited
those
who
succeeded
him
.
<EOS>
The
hurrahs
and
other
vociferations
of
delight
and
enthusiasm
were
changed
into
groans
,
hootings
,
and
discordant
yells
,
when
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
came
in
sight
,
supported
between
two
stout
myrmidons
,
and
scarcely
able
to
maintain
his
perpendicular
as
he
was
borne
by
them
towards
the
wherry
in
waiting
for
him
near
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
Though
the
knight
was
escorted
by
Captain
Bludder
and
his
Alsatian
bullies
,
several
of
the
crowd
did
not
seem
disposed
to
confine
themselves
to
jeers
and
derisive
shouts
,
but
menaced
him
with
some
rough
usage
.
<EOS>
Planting
themselves
in
his
path
,
they
shook
their
fists
in
his
face
,
with
other
gestures
of
defiance
and
indignity
,
and
could
only
be
removed
by
force
.
<EOS>
Captain
Bludder
and
his
roaring
blades
assumed
their
fiercest
looks
,
swore
their
loudest
oaths
,
twisted
their
shaggy
moustaches
,
and
tapped
their
rapier
-
hilts
;
but
they
prudently
forbore
to
draw
their
weapons
,
well
knowing
that
the
proceeding
would
be
a
signal
for
a
brawl
,
and
that
the
cry
of
"
Clubs
!
"
would
be
instantly
raised
.
<EOS>
Amongst
the
foremost
of
those
who
thus
obstructed
Sir
Francis
and
his
party
was
a
young
man
with
a
lithe
active
figure
,
bright
black
eyes
,
full
of
liveliness
and
malice
,
an
olive
complexion
,
and
a
gipsy
-
like
cast
of
countenance
.
<EOS>
Attired
in
a
tight
-
fitting
brown
frieze
jerkin
with
stone
buttons
,
and
purple
hose
,
his
head
was
covered
with
a
montero
cap
,
with
a
cock
's
feather
stuck
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
armed
neither
with
sword
nor
dagger
,
but
carried
a
large
cudgel
or
club
,
the
well
-
known
and
formidable
weapon
,
of
the
London
'
prentices
,
in
the
use
of
which
,
whether
as
a
quarterstaff
or
missile
,
they
were
remarkably
expert
.
<EOS>
Even
a
skilful
swordsman
stood
but
poor
chance
with
them
.
<EOS>
Besides
this
saucy
-
looking
personage
,
who
was
addressed
as
Dick
Taverner
by
his
comrades
,
there
were
many
others
,
who
,
to
judge
from
their
habiliments
and
their
cudgels
,
belonged
to
the
same
fraternity
as
himself
;
that
is
to
say
,
they
were
apprentices
to
grocers
,
drapers
,
haberdashers
,
skinners
,
ironmongers
,
vintners
,
or
other
respectable
artificers
or
tradesfolk
.
<EOS>
Now
Dick
Taverner
had
an
especial
grudge
against
our
two
extortioners
,
for
though
he
himself
,
being
'
prentice
to
a
bookseller
in
Paul
's
Churchyard
,
had
little
concern
with
them
,
he
was
the
son
of
an
inn
-
keeper
—
<EOS>
Simon
Taverner
,
of
the
Emperor
's
Head
,
Garlick
Hill
—
who
had
been
recently
mined
by
their
exactions
,
his
licence
taken
from
him
,
and
his
house
closed
:
enough
to
provoke
a
less
mettlesome
spark
than
Dick
,
who
had
vowed
to
revenge
the
parental
injuries
on
the
first
opportunity
.
<EOS>
The
occasion
now
seemed
to
present
itself
,
and
it
was
not
to
be
lost
.
<EOS>
Chancing
to
be
playing
at
bowls
in
the
alley
behind
the
Three
Cranes
with
some
of
his
comrades
on
the
day
in
question
,
Dick
learnt
from
Cyprien
what
was
going
forward
,
and
the
party
resolved
to
have
their
share
in
the
sport
.
<EOS>
If
needful
,
they
promised
the
drawer
to
rescue
his
mistress
from
the
clutches
of
her
antagonists
,
and
to
drive
them
from
the
premises
.
<EOS>
But
their
services
in
this
respect
were
not
required
.
<EOS>
They
next
decided
on
giving
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
a
sound
ducking
in
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
Their
measures
were
quickly
and
warily
taken
.
<EOS>
Issuing
from
an
arched
doorway
at
the
side
of
the
tavern
,
they
stationed
some
of
their
number
near
it
,
while
the
main
party
posted
themselves
at
the
principal
entrance
in
front
.
<EOS>
Scouts
were
planted
inside
,
to
communicate
with
Cyprien
,
and
messengers
were
despatched
to
cry
"
Clubs
!
"
and
summon
the
neighbouring
'
prentices
from
Queenhithe
,
Thames
Street
,
Trinity
Lane
,
Old
Fish
Street
,
and
Dowgate
Hill
;
so
that
fresh
auxiliaries
were
constantly
arriving
.
<EOS>
Buckingham
,
with
the
young
nobles
and
gallants
,
were
,
of
course
,
allowed
to
pass
free
,
and
were
loudly
cheered
;
but
the
'
prentices
soon
ascertained
from
their
scouts
that
Sir
Francis
was
coming
forth
,
and
made
ready
for
him
.
<EOS>
Utterly
unconscious
of
his
danger
,
the
inebriate
knight
replied
to
the
gibes
,
scoffs
,
and
menaces
addressed
to
him
,
by
snapping
his
fingers
in
his
opponents
'
faces
,
and
irritating
them
in
their
turn
;
but
if
he
was
insensible
of
the
risk
he
ran
,
those
around
him
were
not
,
and
his
two
supporters
endeavoured
to
hurry
him
forward
.
<EOS>
Violently
resisting
their
efforts
,
he
tried
to
shake
them
off
,
and
more
than
once
stood
stock
-
still
,
until
compelled
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
stairhead
,
he
next
refused
to
embark
,
and
a
scene
of
violent
altercation
ensued
between
him
and
his
attendants
.
<EOS>
Many
boats
were
moored
off
the
shore
,
with
a
couple
of
barges
close
at
hand
;
and
the
watermen
and
oarsmen
standing
up
in
their
craft
,
listened
to
what
was
going
forward
with
much
apparent
amusement
.
<EOS>
Hastily
descending
the
steps
,
Captain
Bludder
placed
himself
near
the
wherry
intended
for
the
knight
,
and
called
to
the
others
to
make
short
work
of
it
and
bring
him
down
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
the
word
was
given
by
Dick
Taverner
,
who
acted
as
leader
,
and
in
less
than
two
minutes
,
Sir
Francis
was
transferred
from
the
hands
of
his
myrmidons
to
those
of
the
'
prentices
.
<EOS>
To
accomplish
this
,
a
vigorous
application
of
cudgels
was
required
,
and
some
broken
pates
were
the
consequence
of
resistance
;
but
the
attack
was
perfectly
successful
;
the
myrmidons
and
Alsatians
were
routed
,
and
the
'
prentices
remained
masters
of
the
field
,
and
captors
of
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Stupefied
with
rage
and
astonishment
,
Captain
Bludder
looked
on
;
at
one
moment
thinking
of
drawing
his
sword
,
and
joining
the
fray
;
but
the
next
,
perceiving
that
his
men
were
evidently
worsted
,
he
decided
upon
making
off
;
and
with
this
view
he
was
about
to
jump
into
the
wherry
,
when
his
purpose
was
prevented
by
Dick
Taverner
,
and
a
few
others
of
the
most
active
of
his
companions
,
who
dashed
down
the
steps
to
where
he
stood
.
<EOS>
The
captain
had
already
got
one
foot
in
the
wherry
,
and
the
watermen
,
equally
alarmed
with
himself
,
were
trying
to
push
off
,
when
the
invaders
came
up
,
and
,
springing
into
the
boat
,
took
possession
of
the
oars
,
sending
Bludder
floundering
into
the
Thames
,
where
he
sunk
up
to
the
shoulders
,
and
stuck
fast
in
the
mud
,
roaring
piteously
for
help
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
were
the
'
prentices
seated
,
than
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
was
brought
down
to
them
,
and
the
poor
knight
,
beginning
to
comprehend
the
jeopardy
in
which
he
was
placed
,
roared
for
help
as
lustily
as
the
half
-
drowned
Alsatian
captain
,
and
quite
as
ineffectually
.
<EOS>
The
latter
was
left
to
shift
for
himself
,
but
the
former
was
rowed
out
some
twenty
or
thirty
yards
from
the
shore
,
where
,
a
stout
cord
being
fastened
to
his
girdle
,
he
was
plunged
head
-
foremost
into
the
river
;
and
after
being
thrice
drawn
up
,
and
as
often
submerged
again
,
he
was
dragged
on
board
,
and
left
to
shiver
and
shake
in
his
dripping
habiliments
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
.
<EOS>
The
bath
had
completely
sobered
him
,
and
he
bitterly
bemoaned
himself
,
declaring
that
if
he
did
not
catch
his
death
of
cold
he
should
be
plagued
with
cramps
and
rheumatism
during
the
rest
of
his
days
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
dare
to
utter
any
threats
against
his
persecutors
,
but
he
internally
vowed
to
be
revenged
upon
them
—
cost
what
it
might
.
<EOS>
The
'
prentices
laughed
at
his
complaints
,
and
Dick
Taverner
told
him—"that
as
he
liked
not
cold
water
,
he
should
have
spared
them
their
ale
and
wine
;
but
,
as
he
had
meddled
with
their
liquors
,
and
with
those
who
sold
them
,
they
had
given
him
a
taste
of
a
different
beverage
,
which
they
should
provide
,
free
of
cost
,
for
all
those
who
interfered
with
their
enjoyments
,
and
the
rights
of
the
public
.
"
<EOS>
Dick
added
,
"
that
his
last
sousing
was
in
requital
for
the
stoppage
of
the
Emperor
's
Head
,
and
that
,
with
his
own
free
will
,
he
would
have
left
him
under
the
water
,
with
a
stone
round
his
neck
.
<EOS>
"This
<EOS>
measure
of
retributive
justice
accomplished
,
the
'
prentices
and
their
leader
made
for
the
stairs
,
where
they
landed
,
after
telling
the
watermen
to
row
their
fare
to
the
point
nearest
his
lodgings
;
an
order
which
was
seconded
by
Sir
Francis
himself
,
who
was
apprehensive
of
further
outrage
.
<EOS>
Neither
would
he
tarry
to
take
in
Captain
Bludder
,
though
earnestly
implored
to
do
so
by
that
personage
,
who
,
having
in
his
struggles
sunk
deeper
into
the
oozy
bed
,
could
now
only
just
keep
his
bearded
chin
and
mouth
above
the
level
of
the
tide
.
<EOS>
Taking
compassion
upon
him
,
Dick
Taverner
threw
him
an
oar
,
and
,
instantly
grasping
it
,
the
Alsatian
was
in
this
way
<EOS>
dragged
ashore
;
presenting
a
very
woful
spectacle
,
his
nether
limbs
being
covered
with
slime
,
while
the
moisture
poured
from
his
garments
,
as
it
would
from
the
coat
of
a
water
-
spaniel
.
<EOS>
His
hat
had
floated
down
the
stream
,
and
he
had
left
one
boot
sticking
in
the
mud
,
while
his
buff
jerkin
,
saturated
with
wet
,
clung
to
his
skin
like
a
damp
glove
.
<EOS>
Leaving
him
to
wring
his
cloak
and
dry
his
habiliments
in
the
best
way
he
could
,
the
leader
of
the
'
prentices
collected
together
his
forces
,
and
,
disposing
them
in
something
like
military
array
,
placed
himself
at
their
head
,
and
marched
towards
the
tavern
,
where
they
set
up
a
great
shout
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
they
had
met
with
no
interruption
whatever
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
the
watermen
,
bargemen
,
and
others
,
had
cheered
them
on
in
their
work
of
mischief
;
and
the
crowd
on
shore
appeared
rather
friendly
to
them
than
otherwise
.
<EOS>
Flushed
with
success
,
the
riotous
youths
seemed
well
disposed
to
carry
their
work
of
retribution
to
extremities
,
and
to
inflict
some
punishment
upon
Sir
Giles
proportionate
to
his
enormities
.
<EOS>
Having
ascertained
,
from
their
scouts
,
that
no
one
connected
with
the
usurious
knight
had
come
forth
,
they
felt
quite
secure
of
their
prey
,
and
were
organising
a
plan
of
attack
,
when
intelligence
was
brought
by
a
scout
that
a
great
disturbance
was
going
on
inside
,
in
consequence
of
a
young
gentleman
having
been
arrested
by
Sir
Giles
and
his
crew
,
and
that
their
presence
was
instantly
required
by
Madame
Bonaventure
.
<EOS>
On
hearing
this
,
Dick
Taverner
shouted—"To
<EOS>
the
rescue
!
<EOS>
to
the
rescue
!
"
and
rushed
into
the
house
,
followed
by
the
'
prentices
,
who
loudly
echoed
his
cries
.
<EOS>
"Par
<EOS>
ici
,
Messieurs
!
<EOS>
Par
<EOS>
ici!—this
way
,
this
way
!
"
<EOS>
vociferated
Cyprien
,
who
met
them
in
the
passage—"the
bowling
-
alley
—
there
they
are!"But
the
Gascon
's
directions
were
scarcely
needed
.
<EOS>
The
clashing
of
swords
would
have
served
to
guide
the
'
prentices
to
the
scene
of
conflict
.

CHAPTER
<EOS>
XI.John
Wolfe
.
<EOS>
When
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
called
for
his
reckoning
,
Madame
Bonaventure
took
him
aside
,
showing
,
by
her
looks
,
that
she
had
something
important
to
communicate
to
him
,
and
began
by
telling
him
he
was
heartily
welcome
to
all
he
had
partaken
of
at
her
ordinary
,
adding
that
she
considered
herself
very
greatly
his
debtor
for
the
gallantry
and
zeal
he
had
displayed
in
her
behalf
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
that
I
was
in
any
real
peril
,
my
fair
young
Sir
,
"
she
continued
,
"
though
I
feigned
to
be
so
,
for
I
have
powerful
protectors
,
as
you
perceive
;
and
indeed
this
was
all
a
preconcerted
scheme
between
my
Lord
Roos
and
his
noble
friends
to
turn
the
tables
on
the
two
extortioners
.
<EOS>
But
that
does
not
lessen
my
gratitude
to
you
;
and
I
shall
try
to
prove
it
.
<EOS>
You
are
in
more
danger
than
,
perchance
,
you
wot
of
;
and
I
feel
quite
sure
Sir
Giles
means
to
carry
his
threat
into
execution
,
and
to
cause
your
arrest
.
<EOS>
"Seeing
<EOS>
him
smile
disdainfully
,
as
if
he
had
no
apprehensions
,
she
added
,
<EOS>
somewhat
quickly—"What
will
your
bravery
avail
against
so
many
,
mon
beau
gentilhomme
?
<EOS>
Mon
Dieu
!
<EOS>
nothing
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
I
must
get
you
assistance
.
<EOS>
Luckily
I
have
some
friends
at
hand
,
the
'
prentices
—
grands
et
forts
gaillards
<EOS>
,
avec
des
estocs;—Cyprien
has
told
me
they
are
here
.
<EOS>
Most
certainly
they
will
take
your
part
.
<EOS>
So
,
Sir
Giles
shall
not
carry
you
off
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
"Jocelyn
's
lips
again
curled
with
the
same
disdainful
smile
as
before
.
<EOS>
"Ah
<EOS>
I
vous
etes
trop
temeraire
!
"
<EOS>
Madame
Bonaventure
cried
,
tapping
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
here
for
awhile
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
the
signal
when
you
may
depart
with
safety
.
<EOS>
Do
not
attempt
to
stir
till
then
.
<EOS>
You
understand?"Jocelyn
did
not
understand
very
clearly
;
but
without
making
any
observation
to
the
contrary
,
he
took
the
seat
pointed
out
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
position
was
well
-
chosen
,
inasmuch
as
it
enabled
him
to
command
the
movements
of
the
foe
,
and
offered
him
a
retreat
through
a
side
-
door
,
close
at
hand
;
though
he
was
naturally
quite
ignorant
whither
the
outlet
might
conduct
him
.
<EOS>
While
this
was
passing
,
Sir
Giles
was
engaged
in
giving
directions
respecting
his
partner
,
whose
inebriate
condition
greatly
scandalized
him
;
and
it
was
in
pursuance
of
his
orders
that
Sir
Francis
was
transported
to
the
wharf
where
the
misadventure
before
related
befel
him
.
<EOS>
Never
for
a
moment
did
Sir
Giles
'
watchful
eye
quit
Jocelyn
,
upon
whom
he
was
ready
to
pounce
like
a
tiger
,
if
the
young
man
made
any
movement
to
depart
;
and
he
only
waited
till
the
tavern
should
be
clear
of
company
to
effect
the
seizure
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
another
person
approached
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
friendly
stranger
in
the
furred
gown
and
flat
cap
,
who
had
sat
next
him
at
dinner
,
and
who
,
it
appeared
,
was
not
willing
to
abandon
him
in
his
difficulties
.
<EOS>
Addressing
him
with
much
kindness
,
the
worthy
personage
informed
him
that
he
was
a
bookseller
,
named
John
Wolfe
,
and
carried
on
business
at
the
sign
of
the
Bible
and
Crown
in
Paul
's
Churchyard
,
where
he
should
be
glad
to
see
the
young
man
,
whenever
he
was
free
to
call
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
I
can
not
disguise
from
you
,
Master
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
—
for
your
dispute
with
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
has
acquainted
me
with
your
name
,
"
John
Wolfe
<EOS>
said—"that
<EOS>
your
rashness
has
placed
you
in
imminent
peril
;
so
that
there
is
but
little
chance
for
the
present
of
my
showing
you
the
hospitality
and
kindness
I
desire
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
seems
to
hover
over
you
as
a
rapacious
vulture
might
do
before
making
his
swoop
.
<EOS>
Heaven
shield
you
from
his
talons
!
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
good
young
Sir
,
accept
one
piece
of
caution
from
me
,
which
my
years
and
kindly
feelings
towards
you
entitle
me
to
make
.
<EOS>
An
you
'
scape
this
danger
,
<EOS>
as
I
trust
you
may
,
let
it
be
a
lesson
to
you
to
put
a
guard
upon
your
tongue
,
and
not
suffer
it
to
out
-
run
your
judgment
.
<EOS>
You
are
much
too
rash
and
impetuous
,
and
by
your
folly
(
nay
,
do
not
quarrel
with
me
,
my
young
friend
—
I
can
give
no
milder
appellation
to
your
conduct
)
have
placed
yourself
in
the
power
of
your
enemies
.
<EOS>
Not
only
have
you
provoked
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
,
whose
malice
is
more
easily
aroused
than
appeased
,
but
you
have
defied
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
,
who
is
equally
implacable
in
his
enmities
;
and
as
if
two
such
enemies
were
not
enough
,
you
must
needs
make
a
third
,
yet
more
dangerous
than
either
.
<EOS>
""How
<EOS>
so
,
good
Master
Wolfe
?
"
<EOS>
Jocelyn
cried
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
whom
do
you
refer?""To
whom
should
I
refer
,
Master
Jocelyn
,
"
Wolfe
rejoined
,
"
but
to
my
lord
of
Buckingham
,
whom
you
wantonly
insulted
?
<EOS>
For
the
latter
indiscretion
there
can
be
no
excuse
,
whatever
there
may
be
for
the
former
;
and
it
was
simple
madness
to
affront
a
nobleman
of
his
exalted
rank
,
second
only
in
authority
to
the
King
himself
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
how
have
I
offended
the
Marquis
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Jocelyn
,
surprised
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
it
possible
<EOS>
you
can
have
spoken
at
random
,
and
without
knowledge
of
the
force
of
your
own
words
?
"
<EOS>
John
Wolfe
rejoined
,
looking
hard
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
so
,
for
you
are
plainly
ignorant
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
"
he
added
,
lowering
his
tone
,
"
when
you
said
that
these
two
abominable
extortioners
were
the
creatures
of
some
great
man
,
who
glozed
over
their
villainous
practices
to
the
King
,
and
gave
a
better
account
of
them
than
they
deserve
,
you
were
nearer
the
truth
than
you
imagined
;
but
it
could
hardly
be
agreeable
to
the
Marquis
to
be
told
this
to
his
face
,
since
it
is
notorious
to
all
(
except
to
yourself
)
that
he
is
the
man
.
<EOS>
""Heavens
!
"
exclaimed
Jocelyn
,
"
I
now
see
the
error
I
have
committed
.
<EOS>
""A
<EOS>
grave
error
indeed
,
"
rejoined
Wolfe
,
shaking
his
head
,
"
and
most
difficult
to
be
repaired
—
for
the
plea
of
ignorance
,
though
it
may
suffice
with
me
,
will
scarcely
avail
you
with
the
Marquis
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
can
never
be
urged
,
since
he
disowns
any
connection
with
these
men
;
and
it
is
suspected
that
his
half
-
brother
,
Sir
Edward
Villiers
,
goes
between
them
in
all
their
secret
transactions
.
<EOS>
Of
this
,
however
,
I
know
nothing
personally
,
and
only
tell
you
what
I
have
heard
.
<EOS>
But
if
it
were
not
almost
treasonable
to
say
it
,
I
might
add
,
that
his
Majesty
is
far
too
careless
of
the
means
whereby
his
exchequer
is
enriched
,
and
his
favourites
gratified
;
and
,
at
all
events
,
suffers
himself
to
be
too
easily
imposed
upon
.
<EOS>
Hence
all
these
patents
and
monopolies
under
which
we
groan
.
<EOS>
The
favourites
must
have
money
;
and
as
the
King
has
little
to
give
them
,
they
raise
as
much
as
they
please
on
the
credit
of
his
name
.
<EOS>
Thus
everything
is
sold
;
places
,
posts
,
titles
,
all
have
their
price
—
bribery
and
corruption
reign
everywhere
.
<EOS>
The
lord
-
keeper
pays
a
pension
to
the
Marquis
—
so
doth
the
attorney
-
general
—
and
simony
is
openly
practised
;
for
the
Bishop
of
Salisbury
paid
him
£
3,500
for
his
bishopric
.
<EOS>
But
this
is
not
the
worst
of
it
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
terrible
to
think
of
a
proud
nobleman
,
clothed
almost
with
supreme
authority
,
being
secretly
leagued
with
sordid
wretches
,
whose
practices
he
openly
discountenances
and
contemns
,
and
receiving
share
of
their
spoil
?
<EOS>
Is
it
not
yet
more
terrible
to
reflect
that
the
royal
coffers
are
in
some
degree
supplied
by
similar
means?""'Tis
enough
to
drive
an
honest
man
distracted
,
"
Jocelyn
said
,
"
and
you
can
not
wonder
at
my
indignation
,
though
you
may
blame
my
want
of
caution
.
<EOS>
I
have
said
nothing
half
so
strong
as
you
have
just
uttered
,
Master
Wolfe
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
but
,
my
good
young
Sir
,
I
do
not
publicly
proclaim
my
opinions
as
you
do
.
<EOS>
My
lord
of
Buckingham
's
name
must
no
more
be
called
in
question
than
his
Majesty
's
.
<EOS>
To
associate
the
Marquis
's
name
with
those
of
his
known
instruments
were
to
give
him
mortal
offence
.
<EOS>
Even
to
hint
at
such
a
connection
is
sufficient
to
provoke
his
displeasure
!
<EOS>
But
enough
of
this
.
<EOS>
My
purpose
is
not
to
lecture
you
,
but
to
befriend
you
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
frankly
,
my
good
young
Sir
—
and
be
not
offended
with
the
offer
—
will
my
purse
be
useful
to
you
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
'
tis
freely
at
your
service
;
and
it
may
help
you
in
your
present
emergency
—
<EOS>
for
though
there
is
not
enough
in
it
to
bribe
the
master
to
forego
his
purpose
against
you
<EOS>
,
there
is
amply
sufficient
to
procure
your
liberation
,
privily
,
from
the
men
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
thank
you
heartily
,
good
Master
Wolfe
,
and
believe
me
,
I
am
not
withheld
by
false
pride
from
accepting
your
offer
,
"
Jocelyn
replied
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
must
trust
to
my
own
arm
to
maintain
my
liberty
,
and
to
my
own
address
to
regain
it
,
if
I
be
taken
.
<EOS>
Again
,
I
thank
you
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
""I
grieve
that
I
can
not
lend
you
other
aid
,
"
John
Wolfe
replied
,
looking
compassionately
at
him
;
"
but
my
peaceful
avocations
do
not
permit
me
to
take
any
part
in
personal
conflicts
,
and
I
am
loath
to
be
mixed
up
in
such
disturbances
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
do
not
like
to
stand
by
,
and
see
outrage
done
.
<EOS>
""Concern
<EOS>
yourself
no
more
about
me
,
worthy
Sir
,
"
interrupted
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
shall
not
be
molested
,
and
if
I
should
be
,
I
am
well
able
to
take
care
of
myself
.
<EOS>
Let
those
who
assail
me
bear
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
John
Wolfe
still
lingered
.
<EOS>
"
If
some
of
my
apprentices
were
only
here
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
especially
that
riotous
rogue
,
Dick
Taverner
,
something
might
be
done
to
help
you
effectually.—Ha
!
<EOS>
what
is
that
uproar
?
"
<EOS>
as
a
tumultuous
noise
,
mixed
with
the
cries
of
"
Clubs!—Clubs
!
"
was
heard
without
,
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
wharf
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
I
live
!
<EOS>
the
'
prentices
are
out
,
and
engaged
in
some
mischievous
work
,
and
it
will
be
strange
if
Dick
Taverner
be
not
among
them
.
<EOS>
I
will
see
what
they
are
about
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
he
hurried
to
the
oriel
window
which
looked
out
upon
the
wharf
,
exclaiming—"Ay
<EOS>
,
ay,—'t
is
as
I
thought
.
<EOS>
Dick
isamong
them
,
and
at
their
head
.
'
<EOS>
Fore
heaven
!
<EOS>
they
are
attacking
those
ruffianly
braggarts
from
Whitefriars
,
and
are
laying
about
them
lustily
with
their
cudgels
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
what
is
this
I
see
?
<EOS>
The
Alsatians
and
the
myrmidons
are
routed
,
and
the
brave
lads
have
captured
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
.
<EOS>
What
are
they
about
to
do
with
him
?
<EOS>
I
must
go
forth
and
see
.
<EOS>
"His
<EOS>
purpose
,
however
,
was
prevented
by
a
sudden
movement
on
the
part
of
Sir
Giles
and
his
attendants
.
<EOS>
They
came
in
the
direction
of
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
,
with
the
evident
intention
of
seizing
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
Jocelyn
instantly
sprang
to
his
feet
,
drew
his
sword
,
and
put
himself
in
a
posture
of
defence
.
<EOS>
The
myrmidons
prepared
to
beat
down
the
young
man
's
blade
with
their
halberds
,
and
secure
him
,
when
Jocelyn
's
cloak
was
plucked
from
behind
,
and
he
heard
Madame
Bonaventure
's
voice
exclaim—"Come
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
way!—follow
<EOS>
me
instantly!"Thus
enjoined
,
he
dashed
through
the
door
,
which
was
instantly
fastened
,
as
soon
as
he
had
made
good
his
retreat
.

XII.The
Arrest
and
the
Rescue
.
<EOS>
Lupo
Vulp
had
endeavoured
to
dissuade
Sir
Giles
from
putting
his
design
of
arresting
Jocelyn
into
immediate
execution
;
alleging
the
great
risk
he
would
incur
,
as
well
from
the
resolute
character
of
the
young
man
himself
,
who
was
certain
to
offer
determined
resistance
,
as
from
the
temper
of
the
company
,
which
,
being
decidedly
adverse
to
any
such
step
,
might
occasion
a
disturbance
that
would
probably
result
in
the
prisoner
's
rescue
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
any
case
,
Sir
Giles
,
"
said
the
wily
scrivener
,
"
let
me
counsel
you
to
tarry
till
the
greater
part
of
the
guests
be
gone
,
and
the
assemblage
outside
dispersed
;
for
I
noted
many
turbulent
'
prentices
among
the
mob
,
who
are
sure
to
be
troublesome
.
<EOS>
""Since
<EOS>
the
young
man
shows
no
present
disposition
to
quit
the
house
,
"
Sir
Giles
replied
,
looking
askance
at
Jocelyn
,
who
just
then
had
moved
to
another
part
of
the
room
with
Madame
Bonaventure
,
"
there
is
no
urgency
;
and
it
may
be
prudent
to
pause
a
few
moments
,
as
you
suggest
,
good
Lupo
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
suffer
him
to
depart
.
<EOS>
I
perceive
,
from
her
gestures
and
glances
,
that
our
tricksy
hostess
is
plotting
some
scheme
with
him
.
<EOS>
Plot
away
,
fair
mistress
;
you
must
have
more
cunning
than
I
give
you
credit
for
,
if
you
outwit
me
a
second
time
in
the
same
day
.
<EOS>
I
can
guess
what
she
proposes
.
<EOS>
You
note
that
side
door
near
them
,
Lupo
?
<EOS>
She
is
advising
the
youth
's
flight
that
way
;
and
he
,
like
a
hair
-
brained
fool
,
will
not
listen
to
the
suggestion
.
<EOS>
But
it
will
be
well
to
watch
the
outlet
.
<EOS>
Hark
ye
,
Lanyere
<EOS>
,
"
he
added
to
the
promoter
,
"
take
three
men
with
you
,
and
go
round
quickly
to
the
passage
with
which
yon
door
communicates
.
<EOS>
Station
yourselves
near
the
outlet
;
and
if
Mounchensey
comes
forth
,
arrest
him
instantly
.
<EOS>
You
see
the
door
I
mean
?
<EOS>
About
it
,
<EOS>
quick!"And
Lanyere
instantly
departed
with
three
of
the
myrmidons
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
would
this
arrest
could
be
lawfully
effected
,
Sir
Giles
,
"
said
Lupo
Vulp
,
"
by
a
serjeant
-
at
-
arms
or
pursuivant
.
<EOS>
There
would
then
be
no
risk
.
<EOS>
Again
I
venture
to
counsel
you
to
proceed
regularly
.
<EOS>
No
great
delay
would
be
occasioned
,
if
your
worship
went
to
Westminster
,
and
made
a
complaint
against
the
young
man
before
the
Council
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
a
messenger
of
the
Court
would
be
despatched
to
attach
his
person
;
and
even
if
he
should
quit
the
house
in
the
meanwhile
,
Lanyere
will
keep
on
his
track
.
<EOS>
That
were
the
surest
course
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
manner
of
proceeding
,
I
conclude
it
will
be
by
Ore
tenus
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
likely
that
this
youth
's
headstrong
temper
,
coupled
with
his
fantastic
notions
of
honour
,
will
permit
him
to
deny
your
worship
's
accusation
,
and
therefore
his
confession
being
written
down
,
and
subscribed
by
himself
,
will
be
exhibited
against
him
when
he
is
brought
to
the
bar
of
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
and
he
will
be
judged
ex
ore
suo
.
<EOS>
Your
worship
will
make
quick
work
of
it
.
<EOS>
""Cum
<EOS>
confitente
reo
citius
est
agendum
"
replied
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"
No
one
knows
better
than
thou
,
good
Lupo
,
how
promptly
and
effectually
the
court
of
Star
-
Chamber
will
vindicate
its
authority
,
and
how
severely
it
will
punish
those
who
derogate
from
its
dignity
.
<EOS>
No
part
of
the
sentence
shall
be
remitted
with
my
consent
.
<EOS>
This
insolent
youth
shall
suffer
to
the
same
extent
as
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
Pilloried
,
branded
,
mutilated
,
degraded
,
he
shall
serve
as
a
warning
to
my
enemies
.
<EOS>
""Your
worship
can
scarce
make
him
more
of
a
scarecrow
than
you
have
made
of
Lanyere
,
"
Lupo
remarked
with
a
grin
.
"
<EOS>
But
do
you
decide
on
applying
in
the
first
instance
to
the
Council?""No
,
"
Sir
Giles
replied
,
"
I
will
not
lose
sight
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
shall
not
have
a
chance
of
escape
.
<EOS>
Marked
you
not
,
Lupo
,
how
the
rash
fool
committed
himself
with
Buckingham
?
<EOS>
And
think
you
the
proud
Marquis
would
hold
me
blameless
,
if
,
by
accident
,
he
should
get
off
scot
-
free
,
after
such
an
outrage
?
<EOS>
But
see
!
<EOS>
the
room
is
well
-
nigh
cleared
.
<EOS>
Only
a
few
loiterers
remain
.
<EOS>
The
time
is
come
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
was
about
to
order
the
attack
,
when
the
disturbance
outside
reached
his
ears
,
and
checked
him
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
was
considering
what
could
be
the
cause
of
the
tumult
,
and
hesitating
whether
to
go
forth
and
support
Sir
Francis
,
in
case
he
stood
in
need
of
assistance
,
when
the
discomfited
myrmidons
rushed
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
A
few
words
sufficed
to
explain
what
had
occurred
,
and
indeed
the
bloody
visages
of
some
of
the
men
showed
how
roughly
they
had
been
handled
.
<EOS>
Though
greatly
exasperated
,
Sir
Giles
was
determined
not
to
be
baulked
of
his
prey
;
and
fearing
Jocelyn
might
escape
in
the
confusion
,
which
an
attack
upon
the
'
prentices
would
occasion
,
he
gave
the
word
for
his
instant
seizure
,
and
rushed
towards
him
,
as
before
related
.
<EOS>
How
he
was
baffled
has
already
been
told
.
<EOS>
His
wrath
knew
no
bounds
when
the
young
man
disappeared
.
<EOS>
He
hurled
himself
furiously
against
the
door
,
but
it
resisted
all
his
efforts
to
burst
it
open
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
the
bolt
was
withdrawn
,
and
Clement
Lanyere
and
his
men
stood
before
him
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
you
secured
him
?
"
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
demanded
,
trying
to
descry
the
fugitive
among
them
.
"
<EOS>
Death
and
fiends
!
<EOS>
you
have
not
let
him
escape?""No
<EOS>
one
has
passed
us
,
except
Madame
Bonaventure
,
"
the
promoter
replied
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
wholly
unattended
,
and
came
in
this
direction
.
<EOS>
We
were
stationed
within
yon
anti
-
chamber
,
which
appears
to
be
the
sole
means
of
communication
with
this
passage
,
and
we
ought
therefore
to
have
intercepted
the
young
man
when
he
came
forth
.
<EOS>
""You
were
not
wo
nt
to
be
thus
short
-
sighted
,
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
some
other
mode
of
exit
,
which
you
have
failed
to
discover
,
"
Sir
Giles
cried
furiously
.
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
here
it
is
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
dashing
aside
a
piece
of
tapestry
that
seemed
merely
hung
against
the
wall
,
but
in
reality
concealed
a
short
flight
of
steps
.
"
<EOS>
Purblind
dolts
that
you
are
,
not
to
find
this
out
.
<EOS>
You
shall
answer
for
your
negligence
hereafter
,
if
we
take
him
not
.
"And
,
accompanied
by
the
troop
,
he
hurried
down
the
steps
,
which
brought
him
to
a
lower
room
,
communicating
on
one
hand
with
a
small
court
,
and
,
on
the
other
,
with
the
kitchen
and
offices
attached
to
the
tavern
.
<EOS>
Directing
Lanyere
to
search
the
latter
,
Sir
Giles
rushed
into
the
court
,
and
uttered
a
shout
of
savage
joy
on
perceiving
Jocelyn
,
sword
in
hand
,
scaling
a
wall
which
separated
the
court
from
the
bowling
-
green
.
<EOS>
Some
difficulty
,
it
appeared
,
had
occurred
to
the
hostess
in
forcing
open
a
private
door
in
the
yard
leading
to
the
green
,
which
being
rarely
used
(
for
the
principal
entrance
was
situated
elsewhere
)
,
its
fastenings
were
rusty
,
and
refused
to
act
.
<EOS>
This
delay
favoured
the
pursuers
;
and
on
hearing
their
approach
,
Jocelyn
strove
to
effect
his
retreat
in
the
manner
described
.
<EOS>
But
Sir
Giles
was
further
served
,
though
unintentionally
,
by
Madame
Bonaventure
,
who
succeeded
in
drawing
back
the
rusty
bolt
at
the
very
moment
he
came
up
;
and
no
impediment
now
existing
,
the
knight
thrust
her
rudely
aside
,
and
sprang
through
the
doorway
just
as
Jocelyn
leaped
from
the
wall
.
<EOS>
Disregarding
Sir
Giles
's
summons
to
surrender
,
the
young
man
hurried
on
till
he
reached
the
middle
of
the
bowling
-
green
,
where
,
finding
flight
impossible
,
as
there
was
no
apparent
outlet
at
the
further
end
of
the
garden
,
while
it
was
certain
that
the
tipstaves
would
pluck
him
from
the
wall
with
their
hooks
if
he
attempted
to
clamber
over
it
,
he
turned
,
and
stood
upon
his
defence
.
<EOS>
Willing
to
have
the
credit
of
disarming
him
unaided
,
and
confident
in
his
own
superior
strength
and
skill
,
Sir
Giles
signed
to
his
myrmidons
to
stand
back
,
while
he
alone
advanced
towards
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
A
turn
in
his
strong
wrist
<EOS>
would
,
he
imagined
,
suffice
to
accomplish
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
But
he
found
out
his
error
<EOS>
the
moment
he
engaged
with
his
opponent
.
<EOS>
In
dexterity
and
force
the
latter
was
fully
his
match
,
while
in
nimbleness
of
body
Jocelyn
surpassed
him
.
<EOS>
The
deadly
glances
thrown
at
him
by
the
young
man
showed
that
the
animosity
of
the
latter
would
only
be
satisfied
with
blood
.
<EOS>
Changing
his
purpose
,
therefore
,
Sir
Giles
,
in
place
of
attempting
to
cross
his
antagonist
's
sword
,
rapidly
disengaged
his
point
,
and
delivered
a
stoccata
,
or
in
modern
terms
of
fence
,
a
thrust
in
carte
,
over
the
arm
,
which
was
instantly
parried
.
<EOS>
For
some
minutes
the
conflict
continued
without
material
success
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
Holding
his
rapier
short
,
with
the
point
towards
his
adversary
's
face
,
Jocelyn
retreated
a
few
paces
at
first
,
but
then
,
charging
in
turn
,
speedily
won
back
his
ground
.
<EOS>
Stoccatas
,
imbroccatas
,
drittas
,
mandrittas
,
and
riversas
were
exchanged
between
them
in
a
manner
that
delighted
the
myrmidons
,
most
of
whom
were
amateurs
of
sword
-
play
.
<EOS>
Infuriated
by
the
unexpected
resistance
he
encountered
,
Sir
Giles
,
at
length
,
resolved
to
terminate
the
fight
;
and
,
finding
his
antagonist
constantly
upon
some
sure
ward
,
endeavoured
to
reach
him
with
a
half
incartata
;
but
instantly
shifting
his
body
with
marvellous
dexterity
,
Jocelyn
struck
down
the
other
's
blade
,
and
replied
with
a
straight
thrust
,
which
must
infallibly
have
taken
effect
,
if
his
rapier
had
not
been
beaten
from
his
grasp
by
Clement
Lanyere
at
the
very
moment
it
touched
his
adversary
's
breast
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
the
young
man
's
arms
were
grasped
from
behind
by
two
of
the
myrmidons
,
and
he
lay
at
his
enemy
's
disposal
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
,
however
,
sheathed
his
rapier
,
saying
,
with
a
grim
smile
,
"
that
he
did
not
mean
to
deprive
himself
of
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
his
foe
stand
in
the
pillory
,
and
submit
to
the
sworn
torturer
's
knife
;
"
adding
,
"
it
was
somewhat
strange
that
one
who
could
guard
his
body
so
well
,
should
keep
such
indifferent
watch
over
his
tongue
.
<EOS>
"Jocelyn
made
no
reply
to
the
sarcasm
,
and
the
knight
was
preparing
to
depart
with
his
followers
,
when
a
loud
and
tumultuous
uproar
proclaimed
the
approach
of
the
apprentices
.
<EOS>
The
posse
of
victorious
youths
made
their
way
to
the
bowling
-
green
by
the
principal
entrance
,
situated
,
as
before
mentioned
,
at
a
different
point
from
the
door
by
which
the
others
had
gained
it
.
<EOS>
More
apprehensive
of
losing
his
prisoner
,
than
concerned
for
his
personal
safety
<EOS>
(
for
though
the
aggressive
party
greatly
exceeded
his
own
in
numbers
,
he
knew
well
how
to
deal
with
them
,
being
accustomed
to
such
encounters
)
,
Sir
Giles
gave
some
orders
respecting
Jocelyn
to
Clement
Lanyere
,
and
then
prepared
to
resist
the
onslaught
,
by
causing
his
band
to
form
a
solid
square
;
those
armed
with
bills
and
staves
being
placed
in
the
foremost
ranks
.
<EOS>
This
disposition
being
quickly
made
,
he
drew
his
sword
,
and
in
a
loud
authoritative
tone
commanded
the
apprentices
to
stand
back
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
effect
produced
by
his
voice
,
and
the
terrors
of
his
countenance
,
which
seldom
failed
to
strike
awe
into
beholders
,
that
the
intending
rescuers
came
to
a
halt
,
and
showed
some
hesitation
in
engaging
him
.
<EOS>
"What
means
this
disturbance
?
<EOS>
"
thundered
Sir
Giles
;
"
and
why
do
you
offer
to
molest
me
in
the
execution
of
my
duty
?
<EOS>
Know
you
not
that
assemblages
like
yours
are
unlawful
,
and
that
you
are
liable
to
severe
punishment
,
unless
you
immediately
disperse
yourselves
,
and
peaceably
depart
to
your
own
habitations
?
<EOS>
About
your
business
,
I
say
,
and
trouble
me
no
longer
!
<EOS>
But
first
,
I
command
you
to
deliver
up
your
ringleaders
,
and
especially
those
who
,
as
I
am
told
,
have
perpetrated
the
gross
outrage
and
violence
upon
the
person
of
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
.
<EOS>
An
example
shall
be
made
of
them
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
waste
your
breath
,
Sir
Giles
,
and
your
big
words
will
avail
you
nothing
with
us
,
"
Dick
Taverner
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Now
hear
me
in
return
.
<EOS>
We
,
the
bold
and
loyal
'
prentices
of
London
,
who
serve
our
masters
and
our
masters
'
master
,
the
king
's
highness
,
well
and
truly
,
will
not
allow
an
unlawful
arrest
to
be
made
by
you
or
by
any
other
man
.
<EOS>
And
we
command
you
peaceably
to
deliver
up
your
prisoner
to
us
;
or
,
by
the
rood
!
<EOS>
we
will
take
him
forcibly
from
your
hands!""Out
,
insolent
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sir
Giles
;
"
thou
wilt
alter
thy
tune
when
thou
art
scourged
at
the
cart's
-
tail
.
<EOS>
""You
must
catch
me
first
,
Sir
Giles
,
"
replied
Dick
;
"
and
two
words
will
go
to
that
.
<EOS>
We
have
read
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
a
lesson
he
is
not
likely
to
forget
;
and
we
will
read
you
one
,
an
you
provoke
us
.
<EOS>
We
have
a
few
old
scores
to
wipe
off
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
marry
!
<EOS>
have
we
,
"
cried
an
embroiderer
's
apprentice
;
"
these
extortioners
have
ruined
my
master
's

exclaimed
Dick

<EOS>
"
They

When

""I

cried
the

<EOS>
"
Our

<EOS>
""The
<EOS>

"
replied
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
Their

only

<EOS>
I
repeat
,
no

<EOS>
Since

we

""Ay

chorussed

<EOS>
"Sir

<EOS>
He

laughed
the
goldsmith
's
'
prentice
.
<EOS>
"He
will
buy

"
cried
a
bowyer
.
<EOS>
"We

quoth
Dick
,
making
his

whistle
round
his
head
.
<EOS>
"The

"
<EOS>
cried
Cyprien
,
who
,
with
two
other
serving

the

had
joined
the
assailing
party
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Madame

<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
so
we
will

jovial
Gascon

replied
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Sir
Giles
!
<EOS>
are
we

have
the
young
gentleman
from
you
by
force

free
-

shall
have
him
in
neither

,
"
the
knight
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
You
,
yourself
,
shall
bear
him
company
in
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
Upon
them
,
my
men
,
and
make
for
the
door!"And
as
the
command
was
given
,
he
and
his
troop
made
a
sudden
dash
upon
the
'
prentices
,
who
,
unable
to
stand
against
the
bills
levelled
against
their
breasts
,
gave
way
.
<EOS>
Still
,
the
gallant
youths
were
by
no
means
routed
.
<EOS>
Instantly
closing
upon
their
opponents
,
and
being
quite
as
nimble
of
foot
as
they
,
they
contrived
to
cut
off
their
retreat
from
the
garden
;
and
a
sharp
conflict
took
place
between
the
parties
,
as
they
came
to
close
quarters
near
the
entrance
.
<EOS>
Three
of
the
myrmidons
were
felled
by
Dick
Taverner
's
cudgel
;
and
at
last
,
watching
his
opportunity
,
with
both
hands
he
launched
a
bowl
which
he
had
picked
up
at
Sir
Giles
's
head
.
<EOS>
If
the
missile
had
taken
effect
,
the
fight
would
have
been
over
;
but
the
knight
avoided
the
blow
by
stooping
down
,
and
the
bowl
,
passing
over
him
,
hit
Lupo
Vulp
full
in
the
stomach
,
and
brought
him
to
the
ground
deprived
of
breath
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Sir
Giles
,
springing
quickly
forward
,
pinned
the
apprentice
against
the
wall
with
his
rapier
's
point
.
<EOS>
"I
have
thee
at
last
,
knave
,
"
he
cried
,
seizing
Dick
by
the
collar
,
and
delivering
him
to
the
custody
of
the
myrmidons
nearest
him—"I
<EOS>
told
thee
thou
should'st
visit
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
And
so
thou
shalt
.
<EOS>
"Notwithstanding
<EOS>
the
capture
of
their
leader
<EOS>
,
the
'
prentices
fought
manfully
,
and
it
still
appeared
doubtful
whether
Sir
Giles
would
be
able
to
effect
a
retreat
after
all
,
embarrassed
as
he
now
was
with
two
prisoners
.
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
he
made
a
sign
to
Clement
Lanyere
to
withdraw
with
Jocelyn
through
the
other
door
,
ordering
the
two
myrmidons
who
had
charge
of
Dick
Taverner
to
follow
him
with
their
captive
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
easy
task
to
carry
out
the
order
;
but
the
promoter
managed
to
accomplish
it
.
<EOS>
Single
-
handed
<EOS>
he
drove
back
all
who
opposed
his
progress
,
while
the
two
prisoners
were
borne
towards
the
door
by
the
men
having
them
in
custody
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
Jocelyn
had
made
no
attempt
at
self
-
liberation
;
awaiting
,
probably
,
the
result
of
the
'
prentices
'
efforts
in
his
behalf
,
or
some
more
favourable
opportunity
than
had
hitherto
presented
itself
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
little
court
the
time
for
exertion
seemed
to
be
come
.
<EOS>
Shaking
off
the
myrmidons
who
pinioned
him
,
and
seizing
a
bill
from
one
of
them
,
he
instantly
stretched
the
fellow
at
his
feet
,
and
drove
off
his
comrade
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
lent
immediate
assistance
to
Dick
Taverner
,
setting
him
free
,
and
arming
him
with
as
much
promptitude
as
he
had
used
to
effect
his
own
deliverance
.
<EOS>
While
thus
engaged
,
he
received
no
interruption
from
Clement
Lanyere
,
though
,
if
he
had
chosen
,
the
promoter
might
no
doubt
have
effectually
opposed
him
.
<EOS>
But
Lanyere
either
was
,
or
feigned
to
be
,
engaged
with
some
skirmishers
at
the
door
;
and
it
was
only
when
both
the
prisoners
had
got
free
,
that
he
rushed
towards
them
,
loudly
reprehending
the
men
for
their
carelessness
.
<EOS>
But
if
they
were
to
blame
,
he
was
no
less
so
,
for
he
showed
little
address
in
following
the
fugitives
,
and
managed
to
take
a
wrong
turn
in
the
passage
,
which
led
both
him
and
the
myrmidons
astray
,
so
that
the
prisoners
got
clear
off
.
<EOS>
How
Jocelyn
and
Dick
Taverner
contrived
to
reach
the
Vintry
Wharf
,
neither
of
them
very
distinctly
<EOS>
knew,—such
was
the
hurried
manner
in
which
they
passed
through
the
tavern
;
but
there
they
were
,
precisely
at
the
moment
that
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
,
having
fought
his
way
through
all
opposition
,
issued
from
the
porch
at
the
head
of
his
band
.
<EOS>
Quite
satisfied
with
his
previous
encounter
with
the
redoubtable
knight
,
and
anxious
to
escape
before
his
evasion
<EOS>
should
he
discovered
,
Dick
beckoned
to
his
companion
,
and
,
making
all
the
haste
they
could
to
the
stairs
,
they
both
jumped
into
the
nearest
wherry
,
when
the
apprentice
ordered
the
two
watermen
within
it
to
row
for
their
lives
to
London
-
bridge
.

CHAPTER
XIII.How
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
encountereda
masked
horseman
on
Stamford
Hill
.
<EOS>
Two
days
after
the
events
last
recorded
,
a
horseman
,
followed
at
a
respectful
distance
by
a
mounted
attendant
,
took
his
way
up
Stamford
Hill
.
<EOS>
He
was
young
,
and
of
singularly
prepossessing
appearance
,
with
a
countenance
full
of
fire
and
spirit
,
and
blooming
with
health
,
and
it
was
easy
to
see
that
his
life
had
been
passed
in
the
country
,
and
in
constant
manly
exercise
;
for
though
he
managed
his
horse
—
a
powerful
bay
charger
—
to
perfection
,
there
was
nothing
of
the
town
gallant
,
or
of
the
soldier
,
about
him
.
<EOS>
His
doublet
and
cloak
were
of
a
plain
dark
material
,
and
had
seen
service
;
but
they
well
became
his
fine
symmetrical
figure
,
as
did
the
buff
boots
defending
his
well
-
made
,
vigorous
limbs
.
<EOS>
Better
seat
in
saddle
,
or
lighter
hand
with
bridle
,
no
man
could
possess
than
he
;
and
his
noble
steed
,
which
like
himself
was
full
of
courage
and
ardour
,
responded
to
all
his
movements
,
and
obeyed
the
slightest
indication
of
his
will
.
<EOS>
His
arms
were
rapier
and
dagger
;
and
his
broad
-
leaved
hat
,
ornamented
with
a
black
feather
,
covered
the
luxuriant
brown
locks
that
fell
in
long
ringlets
over
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
So
débonnair
was
the
young
horseman
in
deportment
,
so
graceful
in
figure
,
and
so
comely
in
looks
,
that
he
had
excited
no
little
admiration
as
he
rode
forth
at
an
early
hour
that
morning
from
Bishopgate
Street
,
and
passing
under
the
wide
portal
in
the
old
city
walls
,
speeded
towards
the
then
rural
district
of
Shoreditch
,
leaving
Old
Bedlam
and
its
saddening
associations
on
the
right
,
and
Finsbury
Fields
,
with
its
gardens
,
dog
-
houses
,
and
windmills
,
on
the
left
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
Bishopgate
-
Street
-
Without
a
considerable
crowd
was
collected
round
a
party
of
comely
young
milkmaids
,
who
were
executing
a
lively
and
characteristic
dance
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
bagpipe
and
fiddle
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
carrying
pails
as
was
their
wo
nt
,
these
milkmaids
,
who
were
all
very
neatly
attired
,
bore
on
their
heads
a
pile
of
silver
plate
,
borrowed
for
the
occasion
,
arranged
like
a
pyramid
,
and
adorned
with
ribands
and
flowers
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
they
visited
all
their
customers
and
danced
before
their
doors
.
<EOS>
A
pretty
usage
then
observed
in
the
environs
of
the
metropolis
in
the
month
of
May.
<EOS>
The
merry
milkmaids
set
up
a
joyous
shout
as
the
youth
rode
by
;
and
many
a
bright
eye
followed
his
gallant
figure
till
it
disappeared
.
<EOS>
At
the
Conduit
beyond
Shoreditch
,
a
pack
of
young
girls
,
who
were
drawing
water
,
suspended
their
task
to
look
after
him
;
and
so
did
every
buxom
country
lass
he
encountered
,
whether
seated
in
tilted
cart
,
or
on
a
pillion
behind
her
sturdy
sire
.
<EOS>
To
each
salutation
addressed
to
him
the
young
man
cordially
replied
,
in
a
voice
blithe
as
his
looks
;
and
in
some
cases
,
where
the
greeting
was
given
by
an
elderly
personage
,
or
a
cap
was
respectfully
doffed
to
him
,
he
uncovered
his
own
proud
head
,
and
displayed
his
handsome
features
yet
more
fully
.
<EOS>
So
much
for
the
master
:
now
for
the
man
.
<EOS>
In
his
own
opinion
,
at
least
—
for
he
was
by
no
means
deficient
in
self
-
conceit
—
the
latter
came
in
for
an
equal
share
of
admiration
;
and
certes
,
if
impudence
could
help
him
to
win
it
,
he
lacked
not
the
recommendation
.
<EOS>
Staring
most
of
the
girls
out
of
countenance
,
he
leered
at
some
of
them
so
offensively
,
that
their
male
companions
shook
their
fists
or
whips
at
him
,
and
sometimes
launched
a
stone
at
his
head
.
<EOS>
Equally
free
was
he
in
the
use
of
his
tongue
;
and
his
jests
were
so
scurrilous
and
so
little
relished
by
those
to
whom
they
were
addressed
,
that
it
was
,
perhaps
,
well
for
him
,
in
some
instances
,
that
the
speed
at
which
he
rode
soon
carried
him
out
of
harm
's
reach
.
<EOS>
The
knave
was
not
ill
-
favoured
;
being
young
,
supple
of
limb
,
olive
-
complexioned
,
black
-
eyed
,
saucy
,
roguish
-
looking
,
with
a
turned
-
up
nose
,
and
extremely
white
teeth
.
<EOS>
He
wore
no
livery
,
and
indeed
his
attire
was
rather
that
of
a
citizen
's
apprentice
than
such
as
beseemed
a
gentleman
's
lacquey
.
<EOS>
He
was
well
mounted
on
a
stout
sorrel
horse
;
but
though
the
animal
was
tractable
enough
,
and
easy
in
its
paces
,
he
experienced
considerable
difficulty
in
maintaining
his
seat
on
its
back
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
,
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
and
Dick
Taverner
(
for
the
reader
will
have
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
the
pair
)
arrived
at
Stamford
Hill
;
and
the
former
,
drawing
in
the
rein
,
proceeded
slowly
up
the
gentle
ascent
.
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
those
delicious
spring
mornings
,
when
all
nature
seems
to
rejoice
;
when
the
newly
-
opened
leaves
are
greenest
and
freshest
;
when
the
lark
springs
blithest
from
the
verdant
mead
,
and
soars
nearest
heaven
;
when
a
thousand
other
feathered
choristers
warble
forth
their
notes
in
copse
and
hedge
;
when
the
rooks
caw
mellowly
near
their
nests
in
the
lofty
trees
;
when
gentle
showers
,
having
fallen
overnight
,
have
kindly
prepared
the
earth
for
the
morrow
's
genial
warmth
and
sunshine
;
when
that
sunshine
,
each
moment
,
calls
some
new
object
into
life
and
beauty
;
when
all
you
look
upon
is
pleasant
to
the
eye
,
all
you
listen
to
is
delightful
to
the
ear;—in
short
,
it
was
one
of
those
exquisite
mornings
,
only
to
be
met
with
in
the
merry
month
of
May
,
and
only
to
be
experienced
in
full
perfection
in
Merry
England
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
summit
of
the
hill
,
commanding
such
extensively
charming
views
,
Jocelyn
halted
and
looked
back
with
wonder
at
the
vast
and
populous
city
he
had
just
quitted
,
now
spread
out
before
him
in
all
its
splendour
and
beauty
.
<EOS>
In
his
eyes
it
seemed
already
over
-
grown
,
though
it
had
not
attained
a
tithe
of
its
present
proportions
;
but
he
could
only
judge
according
to
his
opportunity
,
and
was
unable
to
foresee
its
future
magnitude
.
<EOS>
But
if
London
has
waxed
in
size
,
wealth
,
and
population
during
the
last
two
centuries
and
a
-
half
,
it
has
lost
nearly
all
the
peculiar
features
of
beauty
which
distinguished
it
up
to
that
time
,
and
made
it
so
attractive
to
Jocelyn
's
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
diversified
and
picturesque
architecture
of
its
ancient
habitations
,
as
yet
undisturbed
by
the
innovations
of
the
Italian
and
Dutch
schools
,
and
brought
to
full
perfection
in
the
latter
part
of
the
reign
of
Elizabeth
,
gave
the
whole
city
a
characteristic
and
fanciful
appearance
.
<EOS>
Old
towers
,
old
belfries
,
old
crosses
,
slender
spires
innumerable

rose
up
amid
a
world
of
quaint
gables
and
angular
roofs
.
<EOS>
Story
above
story
sprang
those
curious
dwellings
;
irregular
yet
homogeneous
;
dear
to
the
painter
's
and
the
poet
's
eye
;
elaborate
in
ornament
;
grotesque
in
design
;
well
suited
to
the
climate
,
and
admirably
adapted
to
the
wants
and
comforts
of
the
inhabitants
;
picturesque
like
the
age
itself
,
like
its
costume
,
its
manners
,
its
literature
.
<EOS>
All
these
characteristic
beauties
and
peculiarities
are
now
utterly
gone
.
<EOS>
All
the
old
picturesque
habitations
have
been
devoured
by
fire
,
and
a
New
City
has
risen
in
their
stead;—not
to
compare
with
the
Old
City
,
though
—
and
conveying
no
notion
whatever
of
it
—
any
more
than
you
or
I
,
worthy
reader
,
in
our
formal
,
and
,
I
grieve
to
say
it
,
ill
-
contrived
attire
,
resemble
the
picturesque
-
looking
denizens
of
London
,
clad
in
doublet
,
mantle
,
and
hose
,
in
the
time
of
James
the
First
.
<EOS>
Another
advantage
in
those
days
must
not
be
forgotten
.
<EOS>
The
canopy
of
smoke
overhanging
the
vast
Modern
Babel
,
and
oftentimes
obscuring
even
the
light
of
the
sun
itself
,
did
not
dim
the
beauties
of
the
Ancient
City,—sea
coal
being
but
little
used
in
comparison
with
wood
,
of
which
there
was
then
abundance
,
as
at
this
time
in
the
capital
of
France
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
atmosphere
was
clearer
and
lighter
,
and
served
as
a
finer
medium
to
reveal
objects
which
would
now
be
lost
at
a
quarter
the
distance
.
<EOS>
Fair
,
sparkling
,
and
clearly
defined
,
then
,
rose
up
Old
London
before
Jocelyn
's
gaze
.
<EOS>
Girded
round
with
gray
walls
,
defended
by
battlements
,
and
approached
by
lofty
gates
,
four
of
which
—
to
wit
,
Cripplegate
,
Moorgate
,
Bishopgate
,
and
Aldgate
—
were
visible
from
where
he
stood
;
it
riveted
attention
from
its
immense
congregation
of
roofs
,
spires
,
pinnacles
,
and
vanes
,
all
glittering
in
the
sunshine
;
while
in
the
midst
of
all
,
and
pre
-
eminent
above
all
,
towered
one
gigantic
pile
—
the
glorious
Gothic
cathedral
.
<EOS>
Far
on
the
east
,
and
beyond
the
city
walls
,
though
surrounded
by
its
own
mural
defences
,
was
seen
the
frowning
Tower
of
London
—
part
fortress
and
part
prison
—
a
structure
never
viewed
in
those
days
without
terror
,
being
the
scene
of
so
many
passing
tragedies
.
<EOS>
Looking
westward
,
and
rapidly
surveying
the
gardens
and
pleasant
suburban
villages
lying
on
the
north
of
the
Strand
,
the
young
man
's
gaze
settled
for
a
moment
on
Charing
Cross
—
the
elaborately
-
carved
memorial
to
his
Queen
,
Eleanor
,
erected
by
Edward
I.—and
then
ranging
over
the
palace
of
Whitehall
and
its
two
gates
,
Westminster
Abbey
—
more
beautiful
without
its
towers
than
with
them
—
it
became
fixed
upon
Westminster
Hall
;
for
there
,
in
one
of
its
chambers
,
the
ceiling
of
which
was
adorned
with
gilded
stars
,
were
held
the
councils
of
that
terrible
tribunal
which
had
robbed
him
of
his
inheritance
,
and
now
threatened
him
with
deprivation
of
liberty
,
and
mutilation
of
person
.
<EOS>
A
shudder
crossed
him
as
he
thought
of
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
and
he
turned
his
gaze
elsewhere
,
trying
to
bring
the
whole
glorious
city
within
his
ken
.
<EOS>
A
splendid
view
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
Well
might
King
James
himself
exclaim
when
standing
,
not
many
years
previously
,
on
the
very
spot
where
Jocelyn
now
stood
,
and
looking
upon
London
for
the
first
time
since
his
accession
to
the
throne
of
England
—
well
might
he
exclaim
in
rapturous
accents
,
as
he
gazed
on
the
magnificence
of
his
capital—"At
<EOS>
last
the
richest
jewel
in
a
monarch
's
crown
<EOS>
is
<EOS>
mine!"After
satiating
himself
with
this
,
to
him
,
novel
and
wonderful
prospect
<EOS>
,
Jocelyn
began
to
bestow
his
attention
on
objects
closer
at
hand
,
and
examined
the
landscapes
on
either
side
of
the
eminence
,
which
,
without
offering
any
features
of
extraordinary
beauty
,
were
generally
pleasing
,
and
exercised
a
soothing
influence
upon
his
mind
.
<EOS>
At
that
time
Stamford
Hill
was
crowned
with
a
grove
of
trees
,
and
its
eastern
declivity
was
overgrown
with
brushwood
.
<EOS>
The
whole
country
,
on
the
Essex
side
,
was
more
or
less
marshy
,
until
Epping
Forest
,
some
three
miles
off
,
was
reached
.
<EOS>
Through
a
swampy
vale
on
the
left
,
the
river
Lea
,
so
dear
to
the
angler
,
took
its
slow
and
silent
course
;
while
through
a
green
valley
on
the
right
,
flowed
the
New
River
,
then
only
just
opened
.
<EOS>
Pointing
out
the
latter
channel
to
Jocelyn
,
Dick
Taverner
,
who
had
now
come
up
,
informed
him
that
he
was
present
at
the
completion
of
that
important
undertaking
.
<EOS>
And
a
famous
sight
it
was
,
the
apprentice
said
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
Mayor
of
London
,
the
Aldermen
,
and
the
Recorder
were
all
present
in
their
robes
and
gowns
to
watch
the
floodgate
opened
,
which
was
to
pour
the
stream
that
had
run
from
Amwell
Head
into
the
great
cistern
near
Islington
.
<EOS>
And
this
was
done
amidst
deafening
cheers
and
the
thunder
of
ordnance
.
<EOS>
"A
<EOS>
proud
day
it
was
for
Sir
Hugh
Myddleton
,
"
Dick
added
;
"
and
some
reward
for
his
perseverance
through
difficulties
and
disappointments
.
<EOS>
""It
is
to
be
hoped
the
good
gentleman
has
obtained
more
substantial
reward
than
that
,
"
Jocelyn
replied
.
<EOS>
"
He
has
conferred
an
inestimable
boon
upon
his
fellow
-
citizens
,
and
is
entitled
to
their
gratitude
for
it
.
<EOS>
""As
to
gratitude
on
the
part
of
the
citizens
<EOS>
,
I
ca
n't
say
much
for
that
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
not
every
man
that
meets
with
his
desserts
,
or
we
know
where
our
friends
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
and
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
would
be
.
<EOS>
The
good
cits
are
content
to
drink
the
pure
water
of
the
New
River
,
without
bestowing
a
thought
on
him
who
has
brought
it
to
their
doors
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
the
work
has
well
-
nigh
beggared
Sir
Hugh
Myddleton
,
and
he
is
likely
to
obtain
little
recompense
beyond
what
the
consciousness
of
his
own
beneficent
act
will
afford
him
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
will
not
the
King
requite
him
?
"
<EOS>
Jocelyn
asked
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
King
has
requited
him
with
a
title
,
"
Dick
returned
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
title
,
however
,
which
may
be
purchased
at
a
less
price
than
good
Sir
Hugh
has
paid
for
it
,
now
-
a
-
days
.
<EOS>
But
it
must
be
owned
,
to
our
sovereign
's
credit
,
that
he
did
far
more
than
the
citizens
of
London
would
do
;
since
when
they
refused
to
assist
Master
Myddleton
(
as
he
then
was
)
in
his
most
useful
work
,
King
James
undertook
,
and
bound
himself
by
indenture
under
the
great
seal
,
to
pay
half
the
expenses
.
<EOS>
Without
this
,
it
would
probably
never
have
been
accomplished
.
<EOS>
""I
trust
<EOS>
it
may
be
profitable
to
Sir
Hugh
in
the
end
,
"
Jocelyn
said
;
"
<EOS>
and
if
not
,
he
will
reap
his
reward
hereafter
.
<EOS>
""It
is
not
unlikely
we
may
encounter
him
,
as
he
now
dwells
near
Edmonton
,
and
is
frequently
on
the
road
,
"
Dick
said
;
"
and
if
so
,
I
will
point
him
out
to
you
,
<EOS>
I
have
some
slight
acquaintance
with
him
,
having
often
served
him
in
my
master
's
shop
in
Paul
's
Churchyard
.
<EOS>
Talking
of
Edmonton
,
with
your
permission
,
Sir
,
we
will
break
our
fast
at
the
Bell,[1
]
where
I
am
known
,
and
where
you
will
be
well
served
.
<EOS>
The
host
is
a
jovial
fellow
and
trusty
,
and
may
give
us
information
which
will
be
useful
before
we
proceed
on
our
perilous
expedition
to
Theobalds
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
care
not
how
soon
we
arrive
there
,
"
Jocelyn
cried
;
<EOS>
"
for
the
morning
has
so
quickened
my
appetite
,
that
the
bare
idea
of
thy
host
's
good
cheer
makes
all
delay
in
attacking
it
unsupportable
.
<EOS>
""I
am
entirely
of
your
opinion
,
Sir
,
"
Dick
said
,
smacking
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"
At
the
Bell
at
Edmonton
we
are
sure
of
fresh
fish
from
the
Lea
,
fresh
eggs
from
the
farm
-
yard
,
and
stout
ale
from
the
cellar
;
and
if
these
three
things
do
not
constitute
a
good
breakfast
,
I
know
not
what
others
do
.
<EOS>
So
let
us
be
jogging
onwards
.
<EOS>
We
have
barely
two
miles
to
ride
.
<EOS>
Five
minutes
to
Tottenham
;
ten
to
Edmonton
;
'
tis
done!"It
was
not
,
however
,
accomplished
quite
so
soon
as
Dick
anticipated
.
<EOS>
Ere
fifty
yards
were
traversed
,
they
were
brought
to
a
stop
by
an
unlooked
-
for
incident
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
emerging
from
a
thick
covert
of
wood
,
which
had
concealed
him
from
view
,
a
horseman
planted
himself
directly
in
their
path
;
ordering
them
in
a
loud
,
authoritative
voice
,
to
stand
;
and
enforcing
attention
to
the
injunction
by
levelling
a
caliver
at
Jocelyn
's
head
.
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
this
personage
was
as
mysterious
as
formidable
.
<EOS>
The
upper
part
of
his
features
was
concealed
by
a
black
mask
.
<EOS>
His
habiliments
were
sable
;
and
the
colour
of
his
powerful
steed
was
sable
likewise
.
<EOS>
Boots
,
cap
,
cloak
,
and
feather
,
were
all
of
the
same
dusky
hue
.
<EOS>
His
frame
was
strongly
built
,
and
besides
the
caliver
he
was
armed
with
sword
and
poniard
.
<EOS>
Altogether
,
he
constituted
an
unpleasant
obstacle
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
Dick
Taverner
was
not
able
to
render
much
assistance
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
The
suddenness
with
which
the
masked
horseman
burst
forth
upon
them
scared
his
horse
;
and
the
animal
becoming
unmanageable
,
began
to
rear
,
and
finally
threw
its
rider
to
the
ground
—
luckily
without
doing
him
much
damage
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
horseman
,
lowering
his
caliver
,
thus
addressed
Jocelyn
,
who
,
taking
him
for
a
robber
,
was
prepared
to
resist
the
attack
.
<EOS>
"You
are
mistaken
in
me
,
Master
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
,
"
he
said
;
"
I
have
no
design
upon
your
purse
.
<EOS>
I
call
upon
you
to
surrender
yourself
my
prisoner
.
<EOS>
""Never
,
with
life
,
"
the
young
man
replied
.
<EOS>
"
In
spite
of
your
disguise
,
I
recognise
you
as
one
of
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
's
myrmidons
;
and
you
may
conclude
from
our
former
encounter
,
whether
my
resistance
will
be
determined
or
not
.
<EOS>
""You
had
not
escaped
on
that
occasion
,
but
for
my
connivance
,
Master
Jocelyn
,
"
the
man
in
the
mask
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
hear
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
willing
to
befriend
you
on
certain
conditions
;
and
,
to
prove
my
sincerity
<EOS>
,
I
engage
you
shall
go
free
if
you
accept
them
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do
not
feel
disposed
to
make
any
terms
with
you
,
"
Jocelyn
said
sternly
;
"
and
as
to
my
freedom
of
departure
,
I
will
take
care
that
it
is
not
hindered
.
<EOS>
""I
hold
a
warrant
from
the
Star
-
Chamber
for
your
arrest
,
"
said
the
man
in
the
mask
;
"
and
you
will
vainly
offer
resistance
if
I
choose
to
execute
it
.
<EOS>
Let
this
be
well
understood
before
I
proceed
.
<EOS>
And
now
to
show
you
the
extent
of
my
information
concerning
you
,
and
that
I
am
fully
aware
of
your
proceedings
,
I
will
relate
to
you
what
you
have
done
since
you
fled
with
that
froward
apprentice
,
whose
tricks
will
assuredly
bring
him
to
Bridewell
,
from
the
Three
Cranes
.
<EOS>
You
were
landed
at
London
Bridge
,
and
went
thence
with
your
companion
to
the
Rose
at
Newington
Butts
,
where
you
lay
that
night
,
and
remained
concealed
,
as
you
fancied
,
during
the
whole
of
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
you
fancied
your
retreat
was
unknown
,
because
I
was
aware
of
it
,
and
could
have
seized
you
had
<EOS>
I
been
so
disposed
.
<EOS>
The
next
night
you
removed
to
the
Crown
in
Bishopgate
Street
,
and
as
you
did
not
care
to
return
to
your
lodgings
near
Saint
Botolph
's
Church
without
Aldgate
,
you
privily
despatched
Dick
Taverner
to
bring
your
horses
from
the
Falcon
in
Gracechurch
Street
,
where
you
had
left
them
,
with
the
foolhardy
intention
of
setting
forth
this
morning
to
Theobalds
,
to
try
and
obtain
an
interview
of
the
King
.
<EOS>
""You
have
spoken
the
truth
,
"
Jocelyn
replied
in
amazement
;
"
but
if
you
designed
to
arrest
me
,
and
could
have
done
so
,
why
did
you
defer
your
purpose?""Question
me
not
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
Some
day
or
other
I
may
satisfy
you
.
<EOS>
Not
now
.
<EOS>
Enough
that
I
have
conceived
a
regard
for
you
,
and
will
not
harm
you
,
unless
compelled
to
do
so
by
self
-
defence
.
<EOS>
Nay
more
,
I
will
serve
you
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
go
to
Theobalds
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
a
mad
scheme
,
conceived
by
a
hot
brain
,
and
will
bring
destruction
upon
you
.
<EOS>
If
you
persist
in
it
,
I
must
follow
you
thither
,
and
prevent
greater
mischief
.
<EOS>
""Follow
<EOS>
me
,
then
,
if
you
list
,
"
Jocelyn
cried
;
"
for
go
<EOS>
I
shall
.
<EOS>
But
be
assured
I
will
liberate
myself
from
you
if
I
can
.
<EOS>
""Go
,
hot
-
headed
boy
,
"
the
man
in
the
mask
rejoined
,
but
he
then
added
quickly
;
"
yet
no!—I
will
not
deliver
you
thus
to
the
power
of
your
enemies
,
without
a
further
effort
to
save
you
.
<EOS>
Since
you
are
resolved
to
go
to
Theobalds
you
must
have
a
protector
—
a
protector
able
to
shield
you
even
from
Buckingham
,
whose
enmity
you
have
reason
to
dread
.
<EOS>
There
is
only
one
person
who
can
do
this
,
and
that
is
Count
Gondomar
,
the
Spanish
lieger
-
ambassador
.
<EOS>
Luckily
,
he
is
with
the
King
now
.
<EOS>
In
place
of
making
any
idle
attempts
to
obtain
an
interview
of
his
Majesty
,
or
forcing
yourself
unauthorised
on
the
royal
presence
,
which
will
end
in
your
arrest
by
the
Knight
Marshall
,
seek
out
Count
Gondomar
,
and
deliver
this
token
to
him
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
your
story
;
and
do
what
he
bids
you
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
as
he
spoke
the
man
in
the
mask
held
forth
a
ring
,
which
Jocelyn
took
.
<EOS>
"I
intended
to
make
certain
conditions
with
you
,
"
the
mysterious
personage
pursued
,
"
for
the
service
I
should
render
you
,
but
you
have
thwarted
my
plans
by
your
obstinacy
,
and
I
must
reserve
them
to
our
next
meeting
.
<EOS>
For
we
shall
meet
again
,
and
that
ere
long
;
and
then
when
you
tender
your
thanks
for
what
I
have
now
done
,
I
will
tell
you
how
to
requite
the
obligation
.
<EOS>
""I
swear
to
requite
it
if
I
can
—
and
as
you
desire
,
"
Jocelyn
cried
,
struck
by
the
other
's
manner
.
"Enough
!
"
<EOS>
the
masked
personage
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
satisfied
.
<EOS>
Proceed
on
your
way
,
and
may
good
fortune
attend
you
!
<EOS>
Your
destiny
is
in
your
own
hands
.
<EOS>
Obey
Count
Gondomar
's
behests
,
and
he
will
aid
you
effectually
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
without
a
word
more
,
the
man
in
the
mask
struck
spurs
into
his
horse
's
sides
,
and
dashed
down
the
hill
,
at
a
headlong
pace
,
in
the
direction
of
London
.
<EOS>
Jocelyn
looked
after
him
,
and
had
not
recovered
from
his
surprise
at
the
singular
interview
that
had
taken
place
when
he
disappeared
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
Dick
Taverner
having
regained
his
feet
,
limped
towards
him
,
leading
his
horse
.
<EOS>
"It
must
be
the
Fiend
in
person
,
"
quoth
the
apprentice
,
contriving
to
regain
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
"
I
trust
you
have
made
no
compact
with
him
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
a
sinful
one
I
hope
<EOS>
,
"
Jocelyn
replied
,
glancing
at
the
ring
.
<EOS>
And
they
proceeded
on
their
way
towards
Tottenham
,
and
were
presently
saluted
by
the
merry
ringing
of
bells
,
proclaiming
some
village
festival
.

FOOTNOTES:[1

<EOS>
Lest
we
should
be
charged
with
an
anachronism
,
we
may
mention
that
the
Bell
at
Edmonton
,
immortalized
in
the
story
of
John
Gilpin
,
was
in
good
repute
in
the
days
we
treat
of
,
as
will
appear
from
the
following
extract
from
John
Savile
's
Tractate
entitled
,
King
James
,
his
Entertainment
at
Theobald
's
,
with
his
Welcome
to
London
.
<EOS>
Having
described
the
vast
concourse
of
people
that
flocked
forth
to
greet
their
new
Sovereign
on
his
approach
to
the
metropolis
,
honest
John
says—"After
our
breakfast
at
Edmonton
at
the
sign
of
the
Bell
,
we
took
occasion
to
note
how
many
would
come
down
in
the
next
hour
,
so
coming
up
into
a
chamber
next
to
the
street
,
where
we
might
both
best
see
,
and
likewise
take
notice
of
all
passengers
,
we
called
for
an
hour
-
glass
,
and
after
we
had
disposed
of
ourselves
who
should
take
the
number
of
the
horse
,
and
who
the
foot
,
we
turned
the
hour
-
glass
,
<EOS>
which
before
it
was
half
run
out
,
we
could
not
possibly
truly
number
them
,
they
came
so
exceedingly
fast
;
but
there
we
broke
off
,
and
made
our
account
of
309
horses
,
and
137
footmen
,
which
course
continued
that
day
from
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
till
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
and
the
day
before
also
,
as
the
host
of
the
house
told
us
,
without
intermission
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Besides
establishing
the
existence
of
the
renowned
Bellat
this
period
,
the
foregoing
passage
is
curious
in
other
respects
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
XIV.The
<EOS>
May
-
Queen
and
the
Puritan
's
Daughter
.
<EOS>
Popular
sports
and
pastimes
were
wisely
encouraged
by
James
the
First
,
whose
great
consideration
for
the
enjoyments
of
the
humbler
classes
of
his
subjects
can
not
be
too
highly
commended
;
and
since
the
main
purpose
of
this
history
is
to
point
out
some
of
the
abuses
prevalent
during
his
reign
,
it
is
but
fair
that
at
least
one
of
the
redeeming
features
should
be
mentioned
.
<EOS>
It
has
ever
been
the
practice
of
sour
-
spirited
sectarianism
to
discountenance
recreations
of
any
kind
,
however
harmless
,
on
the
Sabbath
;
and
several
flagrant
instances
of
this
sort
of
interference
,
on
the
part
of
the
puritanical
preachers
and
their
disciples
,
having
come
before
James
during
his
progress
through
the
northern
counties
of
England
,
and
especially
Lancashire
,
he
caused
,
on
his
return
to
London
,
his
famous
Declaration
concerning
Lawful
Sports
on
Sundays
and
holidays
to
be
promulgated
;
wherein
a
severe
rebuke
was
administered
to
the
Puritans
and
precisians
,
and
the
cause
of
the
people
espoused
in
terms
,
which
,
while
most
creditable
to
the
monarch
,
are
not
altogether
inapplicable
to
other
times
besides
those
in
which
they
were
delivered
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whereas
,
"
says
King
James
,
in
his
Manifesto
,
"
We
did
justly
rebuke
some
Puritans
and
precise
people
,
and
took
order
that
the
like
unlawful
carriage
should
not
be
used
by
any
of
them
hereafter
,
in
the
prohibiting
and
unlawful
punishing
of
our
good
people
for
using
their
lawful
recreations
and
honest
exercises
upon
Sundays
and
other
holidays
,
after
the
afternoon
sermon
or
service
:
we
now
find
that
two
sorts
of
people
wherewith
that
country
is
much
infested
<EOS>
(
we
mean
Papists
and
Puritans
)
have
maliciously
traduced
those
our
just
and
honourable
proceedings
.
<EOS>
And
therefore
we
have
thought
good
hereby
to
clear
and
make
our
pleasure
to
be
manifested
to
all
our
good
people
in
those
parts
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
sums
up
his
arguments
,
in
favour
of
the
license
granted
,
as
follows:—"For
when
shall
the
common
people
have
leave
to
exercise
,
if
not
upon
the
Sundays
and
holidays
,
seeing
they
must
apply
their
labour
,
and
win
their
living
in
all
working
days
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Truly
,
an
unanswerable
proposition
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
that
these
provisions
for
rational
recreation
were
made
,
all
unlawful
games
were
prohibited
.
<EOS>
Conformity
was
strictly
enjoined
on
the
part
of
the
Puritans
themselves
;
and
disobedience
was
rendered
punishable
by
expatriation
,
as
in
the
case
of
recusants
generally
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
tenor
of
the
royal
mandate
addressed
to
the
bishop
of
each
diocese
and
to
all
inferior
clergy
throughout
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
Arbitrary
it
might
be
,
but
it
was
excellent
in
intention
;
for
stubborn
-
necked
personages
had
to
be
dealt
with
,
with
whom
milder
measures
would
have
proved
ineffectual
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
violent
opposition
was
raised
against
the
decree
,
and
the
Puritanical
preachers
wore
loud
in
its
condemnation
,
and
as
far
as
was
consistent
with
safety
,
vehement
in
their
attacks
upon
its
royal
author
.
<EOS>
The
boon
,
however
,
was
accepted
by
the
majority
of
the
people
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
was
offered
,
and
the
licence
afforded
them
was
but
little
abused
.
<EOS>
Perfect
success
,
indeed
,
must
have
attended
the
benign
measure
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
efforts
of
the
Puritanical
and
Popish
parties
,
who
made
common
cause
against
it
,
and
strove
by
every
means
to
counteract
its
beneficial
influence
:
<EOS>
the
first
because
in
the
austerity
of
their
faith
they
would
not
have
the
Sabbath
in
the
slightest
degree
profaned
,
even
by
innocent
enjoyment
;
the
second
,
not
because
they
cared
about
the
fancied
desecration
of
the
Lord
's
day
,
but
because
they
would
have
no
other
religion
enjoy
the
same
privileges
as
their
own
.
<EOS>
Thus
sectarianism
and
intolerance
went
for
once
hand
in
hand
,
and
openly
or
covertly
,
as
they
found
occasion
,
did
their
best
to
make
the
people
dissatisfied
with
the
benefit
accorded
them
,
trying
to
persuade
them
its
acceptance
would
prejudice
their
eternal
welfare
.
<EOS>
Such
arguments
,
however
,
had
no
great
weight
with
the
masses
,
who
could
not
be
brought
to
see
any
heinous
or
deadly
sin
in
lawful
recreation
or
exercises
after
divine
service
,
always
provided
the
service
itself
were
in
no
respect
neglected
;
and
so
the
King
's
decree
prevailed
over
all
sectarian
opposition
,
and
was
fully
carried
out
.
<EOS>
The
merry
month
of
May
became
really
a
season
of
enjoyment
,
and
was
kept
as
a
kind
of
floral
festival
in
every
village
throughout
the
land
.
<EOS>
May
-
games
,
Whitsun
-
ales
,
Morrice
-
dances
,
were
renewed
as
in
bygone
times
;
and
all
robust
and
healthful
sports
,
as
leaping
,
vaulting
,
and
archery
,
were
not
only
permitted
on
Sundays
by
the
authorities
,
but
enjoined
.
<EOS>
These
preliminary
remarks
are
made
for
the
better
understanding
of
what
is
to
follow
.
<EOS>
We
have
already
stated
that
long
before
Jocelyn
and
his
companion
reached
Tottenham
,
they
were
made
aware
by
the
ringing
of
bells
from
its
old
ivy
-
grown
church
tower
,
and
by
other
joyful
sounds
,
that
some
festival
was
taking
place
there
;
and
the
nature
of
the
festival
was
at
once
revealed
,
as
they
entered
the
long
straggling
street
,
then
,
as
now
,
constituting
the
chief
part
of
the
pretty
little
village
,
and
beheld
a
large
assemblage
of
country
folk
,
in
holiday
attire
,
wending
their
way
towards
the
green
for
the
purpose
of
setting
up
a
May
-
pole
upon
it
,
and
making
the
welkin
ring
with
their
gladsome
shouts
.
<EOS>
All
the
youths
and
maidens
of
Tottenham
and
its
vicinity
,
it
appeared
,
had
risen
before
daybreak
that
morning
,
and
sallied
forth
into
the
woods
to
cut
green
boughs
,
and
gather
wild
—
flowers
,
for
the
ceremonial
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
they
selected
and
hewed
down
a
tall
,
straight
tree
—
the
tallest
and
straightest
they
could
find
;
and
,
stripping
off
its
branches
,
placed
it
on
a
wain
,
and
dragged
it
to
the
village
with
the
help
of
an
immense
team
of
oxen
,
numbering
as
many
as
forty
yoke
.
<EOS>
Each
ox
had
a
garland
of
flowers
fastened
to
the
tip
of
its
horns
;
and
the
tall
spar
itself
was
twined
round
with
ropes
of
daffodils
,
blue
-
bells
,
cowslips
,
primroses
,
and
other
early
flowers
,
while
its
summit
was
surmounted
with
a
floral
crown
,
and
festooned
with
garlands
,
various
-
coloured
ribands
,
kerchiefs
,
and
streamers
.
<EOS>
The
foremost
yokes
of
oxen
had
bells
hung
round
their
necks
,
which
they
shook
as
they
moved
along
,
adding
their
blithe
melody
to
the
general
hilarious
sounds
.
<EOS>
When
the
festive
throng
reached
the
village
,
all
its
inhabitants
—
male
and
female
,
old
and
young
—
rushed
forth
to
greet
them
;
and
such
as
were
able
to
leave
their
dwellings
for
a
short
while
joined
in
the
procession
,
at
the
head
of
which
,
of
course
,
was
borne
the
May
-
pole
.
<EOS>
After
it
,
came
a
band
of
young
men
,
armed
with
the
necessary
implements
for
planting
the
shaft
in
the
ground
;
and
after
them
a
troop
of
maidens
,
bearing
bundles
of
rushes
.
<EOS>
Next
came
the
minstrels
,
playing
merrily
on
tabor
,
fife
,
sacbut
,
rebec
,
and
tambourine
.
<EOS>
Then
followed
the
Queen
of
the
May
,
walking
by
herself,—a
rustic
beauty
,
hight
Gillian
Greenford,—fancifully
and
prettily
arrayed
for
the
occasion
,
and
attended
,
at
a
little
distance
,
by
Robin
Hood
,
Maid
Marian
,
Friar
Tuck
,
the
Hobby
-
horse
,
and
a
band
of
morrice
-
dancers
.
<EOS>
Then
came
the
crowd
,
pellmell
,
laughing
,
shouting
,
and
huzzaing,—most
of
the
young
men
and
women
bearing
green
branches
of
birch
and
other
trees
in
their
hands
.
<EOS>
The
spot
selected
for
the
May
-
pole
was
a
piece
of
green
sward
in
the
centre
of
the
village
,
surrounded
by
picturesque
habitations
,
and
having
,
on
one
side
of
it
,
the
ancient
Cross
.
<EOS>
The
latter
,
however
,
was
but
the
remnant
of
the
antique
structure
,
the
cross
having
been
robbed
of
its
upper
angular
bar
,
and
otherwise
mutilated
,
at
the
time
of
the
Reformation
,
and
it
was
now
nothing
more
than
a
high
wooden
pillar
,
partly
cased
with
lead
to
protect
it
from
the
weather
,
and
supported
by
four
great
spurs
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
green
,
the
wain
was
brought
to
a
halt
;
the
crowd
forming
a
vast
circle
round
it
,
so
as
not
to
interfere
with
the
proceedings
.
<EOS>
The
pole
was
then
taken
out
,
reared
aloft
,
and
so
much
activity
was
displayed
,
so
many
eager
hands
assisted
,
that
in
an
inconceivably
short
space
of
time
it
was
firmly
planted
in
the
ground
;
whence
it
shot
up
like
the
central
mast
of
a
man
-
of
-
war
,
far
overtopping
the
roofs
of
the
adjoining
houses
,
and
looking
very
gay
indeed
,
with
its
floral
crown
a
-
top
,
and
its
kerchiefs
and
streamers
fluttering
in
the
breeze
.
<EOS>
Loud
and
reiterated
shouts
broke
from
the
assemblage
on
the
satisfactory
completion
of
the
ceremony
,
the
church
bells
pealed
merrily
,
and
the
minstrels
played
their
most
enlivening
strains
.
<EOS>
The
rushes
were
strewn
on
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
May
-
pole
,
and
arbours
were
formed
,
with
marvellous
celerity
,
in
different
parts
of
the
green
,
with
the
branches
of
the
trees
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
the
ancient
Cross
was
decorated
with
boughs
and
garlands
.
<EOS>
The
whole
scene
offered
as
pretty
and
cheerful
a
sight
as
could
be
desired
;
but
there
was
one
beholder
,
as
will
presently
appear
,
who
viewed
it
in
a
different
light
.
<EOS>
It
now
came
to
the
Queen
of
the
May
's
turn
to
advance
to
the
pole
,
and
stationing
herself
beneath
it
,
the
morrice
-
dancers
and
the
rest
of
the
mummers
formed
a
ring
round
her
,
and
,
taking
hands
,
footed
it
merrily
to
the
tune
of
"
Green
Sleeves
.
<EOS>
"Long
before
this
,
Jocelyn
and
his
attendant
had
come
up
,
and
both
were
so
much
interested
that
they
felt
no
disposition
to
depart
.
<EOS>
Gillian
's
attractions
had
already
fired
the
inflammable
heart
of
the
apprentice
,
who
could
not
withdraw
his
gaze
from
her
;
and
so
ardent
were
his
looks
,
and
so
expressive
his
gestures
of
admiration
,
that
ere
<EOS>
long
he
succeeded
,
to
his
no
small
delight
,
in
attracting
her
notice
in
return
.
<EOS>
Gillian
Greenford
was
a
bright
-
eyed
,
fair
-
haired
young
creature
;
light
,
laughing
,
radiant
;
with
cheeks
soft
as
peach
bloom
,
and
beautifully
tinged
with
red
,
lips
carnation
-
hued
,
and
teeth
white
as
pearls
.
<EOS>
Her
parti
-
coloured
,
linsey
-
woolsey
petticoats
looped
up
on
one
side
disclosed
limbs
with
no
sort
of
rustic
clumsiness
about
them
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
a
particularly
neat
formation
both
of
foot
and
ankle
.
<EOS>
Her
scarlet
bodice
,
which
,
like
the
lower
part
of
her
dress
,
was
decorated
with
spangles
,
bugles
,
and
tinsel
ornaments
of
various
kinds,—very
resplendent
in
the
eyes
of
the
surrounding
swains
,
as
well
as
in
those
of
Dick
Taverner,—her
bodice
,
we
say
,
spanning
a
slender
waist
,
was
laced
across
,
while
the
snowy
kerchief
beneath
it
did
not
totally
conceal
a
very
comely
bust
.
<EOS>
A
wreath
of
natural
flowers
was
twined
very
gracefully
within
her
waving
and
almost
lint
-
white
locks
,
and
in
her
hand
she
held
a
shepherdess
's
crook
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
Beauty
of
Tottenham
,
and
the
present
Queen
of
the
May.
Dick
Taverner
<EOS>
thought
her
little
less
than
angelic
,
and
there
were
many
besides
who
shared
in
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
If
Dick
had
been
thus
captivated
on
the
sudden
,
Jocelyn
had
not
escaped
similar
fascination
from
another
quarter
.
<EOS>
It
befel
in
this
way
:
At
an
open
oriel
window
,
in
one
of
the
ancient
and
picturesque
habitations
before
described
as
facing
the
green
,
stood
a
young
maiden
,
whose
beauty
was
of
so
high
an
order
,
and
so
peculiar
a
character
,
<EOS>
that
it
at
once
attracted
and
fixed
attention
.
<EOS>
Such
,
at
least
,
was
the
effect
produced
by
it
on
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
Shrinking
from
the
public
gaze
,
and
,
perhaps
,
from
some
motive
connected
with
religious
scruples
,
scarcely
deeming
it
right
to
be
a
spectator
of
the
passing
scene
,
this
fair
maiden
was
so
placed
as
to
be
almost
screened
from
general
view
.
<EOS>
Yet
it
chanced
that
Jocelyn
,
from
the
circumstance
of
being
on
horseback
,
and
from
his
position
,
was
able
to
command
a
portion
of
the
room
in
which
she
stood
;
and
he
watched
her
for
some
minutes
before
she
became
aware
she
was
the
object
of
his
regards
.
<EOS>
When
,
at
length
,
she
perceived
that
his
gaze
was
steadily
fixed
upon
her
,
<EOS>
a
deep
blush
suffused
her
cheeks
,
and
she
would
have
instantly
retired
,
if
the
young
man
had
not
at
once
lowered
his
looks
.
<EOS>
Still
,
he
ever
and
anon
ventured
a
glance
towards
the
oriel
window
,
and
was
delighted
to
find
the
maiden
still
there,—nay
,
he
fancied
she
must
have
advanced
a
step
or
two
,
for
he
could
unquestionably
distinguish
her
features
more
plainly
.
<EOS>
And
lovely
they
were
—
most
lovely
!
<EOS>
pensive
in
expression
,
and
perhaps
a
thought
too
pale
,
until
the
crimsoning
tide
had
mounted
to
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
Thus
mantled
with
blushes
,
her
countenance
might
gain
something
in
beauty
,
but
it
lost
much
of
the
peculiar
charm
which
it
derived
from
extreme
transparency
and
whiteness
of
skin
—
a
tint
which
set
off
to
perfection
the
splendour
of
her
magnificent
black
eyes
,
with
their
darkly
-
fringed
lids
and
brows
,
while
it
also
relieved
,
in
an
equal
degree
,
the
jetty
lustre
of
her
hair
.
<EOS>
Her
features
were
exquisitely
chiselled
,
delicate
and
classical
in
mould
,
and
stamped
with
refinement
and
intelligence
.
<EOS>
Perfect
simplicity
,
combined
with
a
total
absence
of
personal
ornament
,
distinguished
her
attire
;
and
her
raven
hair
was
plainly
,
but
by
no
means
unbecomingly
,
braided
over
her
snowy
forehead
.
<EOS>
Something
in
this
simplicity
of
costume
and
in
her
manner
inclined
Jocelyn
to
think
the
fair
maiden
must
belong
to
some
family
professing
Puritanical
opinions
;
and
he
found
,
upon
inquiry
from
one
of
his
neighbours
in
the
throng
—
an
old
farmer
—
that
this
was
actually
the
case
.
<EOS>
The
young
lady
was
Mistress
Aveline
Calveley
,
his
informant
said
,
only
child
of
Master
Hugh
Calveley
,
who
had
but
lately
come
to
dwell
in
Tottenham
,
and
of
whom
little
was
known
,
save
that
he
was
understood
to
have
fought
at
the
battle
of
Langside
,
and
served
with
great
bravery
,
under
Essex
,
both
in
Spain
and
in
Ireland
,
in
the
times
of
good
Queen
Bess
—
such
times
as
England
would
never
see
again
,
the
old
farmer
parenthetically
remarked
,
with
a
shake
of
the
head
.
<EOS>
Master
Hugh
Calveley
,
he
went
on
to
say
,
was
a
strict
Puritan
,
austere
in
his
life
,
and
morose
in
manner
;
an
open
railer
against
the
licence
of
the
times
,
and
the
profligacy
of
the
court
minions,—in
consequence
of
which
he
had
more
than
once
got
himself
into
trouble
.
<EOS>
He
abhorred
all
such
sports
as
were
now
going
forward
;
and
had
successfully
interfered
with
the
parish
priest
,
Sir
Onesimus
,
who
was
somewhat
of
a
precisian
himself
,
to
prevent
the
setting
up
the
May
-
pole
on
the
past
Sunday,—for
which
,
the
farmer
added
,
some
of
the
young
folks
owe
him
a
grudge
;
and
he
expressed
a
hope
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
the
day
might
pass
by
without
any
exhibition
being
made
of
their
ill
-
will
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"These
<EOS>
Puritans
are
not
in
favour
with
our
youth
,
"
the
old
man
said
;
"
and
no
great
marvel
they
be
not
;
for
they
check
them
in
their
pleasures
,
and
reprove
them
for
harmless
mirth
.
<EOS>
Now
,
as
to
Mistress
Aveline
herself
,
she
is
devout
and
good
;
but
she
takes
no
part
in
the
enjoyments
proper
to
her
years
,
and
leads
a
life
more
like
a
nun
in
a
convent
,
or
a
recluse
in
a
cell
,
than
a
marriageable
young
lady
.
<EOS>
She
never
stirs
forth
without
her
father
,
and
,
as
you
may
suppose
,
goes
more
frequently
to
lecture
,
or
to
church
,
or
to
some
conventicle
,
than
anywhere
else
.
<EOS>
Such
a
life
would
not
suit
my
grandchild
,
Gillian
,
at
all
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
Mistress
Aveline
is
a
sweet
young
lady
,
much
beloved
for
her
kindness
and
goodness
;
and
her
gentle
words
have
healed
many
a
wound
occasioned
by
the
harsh
speech
and
severe
reproofs
of
her
father
.
<EOS>
There
,
Sir,—you
may
behold
her
fair
and
saintly
countenance
now
.
<EOS>
She
seems
pleased
with
the
scene
,
and
I
am
sure
she
well
may
be
;
for
it
is
always
a
pleasant
and
a
heart
-
cheering
sight
to
see
folks
happy
and
enjoying
themselves
;
and
I
can
not
think
that
the
beneficent
Power
above
ever
intended
we
should
make
ourselves
miserable
on
earth
,
in
order
to
win
a
place
in
heaven
.
<EOS>
I
am
an
old
man
,
Sir
;
and
feeling
this
to
be
true
,
I
have
ever
inculcated
my
opinions
upon
my
children
and
grandchildren
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
confess
I
am
surprised
—
knowing
what
I
do
of
her
father
's
character
—
that
Mistress
Aveline
should
indulge
herself
with
beholding
this
profane
spectacle
,
which
ought
,
by
rights
,
to
be
odious
in
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
latter
part
of
this
speech
was
uttered
with
a
sly
chuckle
on
the
part
of
the
old
farmer
,
not
altogether
agreeable
to
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
The
growing
interest
he
felt
in
the
fair
Puritan
rendered
him
susceptible
.
<EOS>
The
eyes
of
the
two
young
persons
had
met
again
more
than
once
,
and
were
not
quite
so
quickly
withdrawn
on
either
side
as
before
;
perhaps
,
because
Aveline
was
less
alarmed
by
the
young
man
's
appearance
,
or
more
attracted
by
it
;
and
perhaps
,
on
his
part
,
because
he
had
grown
a
little
bolder
.
<EOS>
We
know
not
how
this
might
be
;
but
we
do
know
that
the
fair
Puritan
had
gradually
advanced
towards
the
front
of
the
window
,
and
was
now
leaning
slightly
out
of
it
,
so
that
her
charms
of
face
and
figure
were
more
fully
revealed
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
May
-
pole
had
been
planted
,
and
the
first
dance
round
it
concluded
.
<EOS>
At
its
close
,
Gillian
,
quitting
her
post
of
honour
near
the
tree
,
and
leaving
the
morrice
-
dancers
and
mummers
to
resume
their
merry
rounds
,
unsanctioned
by
her
sovereign
presence
,
took
a
tambourine
from
one
of
the
minstrels
,
and
proceeded
to
collect
gratuities
within
it
intended
for
the
hired
performers
in
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
successful
in
her
efforts
,
as
the
number
of
coins
,
soon
visible
within
the
tambourine
,
showed
.
<EOS>
Not
without
blushing
and
some
hesitation
did
the
May
Queen
approach
Dick
Taverner
.
<EOS>
The
'
prentice
made
a
pretence
of
fumbling
in
his
pouch
in
order
to
prolong
the
interview
,
which
chance
had
thus
procured
him
;
and
after
uttering
all
the
complimentary
phrases
he
could
muster
,
and
looking
a
great
deal
more
than
he
said
,
he
wound
up
his
speech
by
declaring
he
would
bestow
a
mark
(
and
that
was
no
slight
sum
,
for
the
highest
coin
yet
given
was
a
silver
groat
)
upon
the
minstrels
,
if
they
would
play
a
lively
dance
for
him
,
and
she
,
the
May
Queen
,
would
grace
him
with
her
hand
in
it
.
<EOS>
Encouraged
by
the
laughter
of
the
bystanders
,
and
doubtless
entertaining
no
great
dislike
to
the
proposal
,
Gillian
,
with
a
little
affected
coyness
,
consented
;
and
the
mark
was
immediately
deposited
in
the
tambourine
by
Dick
,
who
,
transported
by
his
success
,
sprang
from
his
saddle
,
and
committing
his
steed
to
the
care
of
a
youth
near
him
,
whom
he
promised
to
reward
for
his
trouble
,
followed
close
after
the
May
Queen
,
as
she
proceeded
with
her
collection
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
she
came
to
Jocelyn
,
and
held
out
the
tambourine
towards
him
.
<EOS>
An
idea
just
then
occurred
to
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
"You
have
a
pretty
nosegay
there
,
fair
maiden
,
"
he
said
,
pointing
to
a
bunch
of
pinks
and
other
fragrant
flowers
in
her
breast
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
buy
it
from
you
,
if
you
list
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
shall
have
it
and
welcome
,
fair
Sir
,
"
Gillian
replied
,
detaching
the
bouquet
from
her
dress
,
and
offering
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
"Well
done
,
Gillian
,
"
the
old
farmer
cried
approvingly
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
are
you
there
,
grandsire
!
"
<EOS>
the
May
Queen
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
Come
!
<EOS>
your
gift
for
the
minstrels
and
mummers
—
quick
!
<EOS>
quick!"And
<EOS>
while
old
Greenford
searched
for
a
small
coin
,
Jocelyn
placed
a
piece
of
silver
in
the
tambourine
.
<EOS>
"Will
<EOS>
you
do
me
a
favour
,
my
pretty
maiden
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
courteously
.
<EOS>
"That
<EOS>
I
will
,
right
willingly
,
fair
Sir
,
"
she
replied
;
"
provided
I
may
do
it
honestly
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
shall
not
do
it
else
,
"
old
Greenford
observed
.
<EOS>
"Come
,
your
gift
,
grandsire
—
you
are
slow
in
finding
it
.
<EOS>
""Have
<EOS>
patience
,
wench
,
have
patience
.
<EOS>
Young
folks
are
always
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
Here
'
tis!""Only
a
silver
groat
!
<EOS>
"
she
exclaimed
,
tossing
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
this
young
man
behind
me
gave
a
mark
;
and
so
did
this
gallant
gentleman
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
""Poh
!
<EOS>
poh
!
<EOS>
go
along
,
wench
.
<EOS>
They
will
take
better
care
of
their
money
when
they
grow
older
.
<EOS>
""Stay
,
my
pretty
maiden
,
"
Jocelyn
cried
;
"
you
have
promised
to
do
me
a
favour
.
<EOS>
""What
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
she
inquired
.
<EOS>
"Present
<EOS>
this
nosegay
on
my
part
to
the
young
lady
in
yonder
window
.
<EOS>
""What
!
<EOS>
offer
this
to
Mistress
Aveline
Calveley
?
"
<EOS>
Gillian
exclaimed
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Are
you
sure
she
will
accept
it
,
Sir?""Tut
!
<EOS>
do
his
bidding
,
child
,
without
more
ado
,
"
old
Greenford
interposed
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
like
to
see
what
will
come
of
it
—
ha
!
<EOS>
ha!"Gillian
could
not
help
smiling
too
,
and
proceeded
on
her
mission
.
<EOS>
Jocelyn
put
his
horse
into
motion
,
and
slowly
followed
her
,
almost
expecting
Aveline
to
withdraw
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
agreeably
disappointed
by
finding
her
maintain
her
place
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
remarked
what
was
going
forward
,
and
therefore
her
tarrying
emboldened
him
,
and
buoyed
up
his
hopes
.
<EOS>
Arrived
beneath
the
window
,
Gillian
committed
the
tambourine
to
Dick
Taverner
,
who
still
hovered
behind
her
like
her
shadow
,
and
fastening
the
bouquet
to
the
end
of
her
shepherdess
's
crook
held
it
up
towards
Aveline
,
crying
out
,
in
a
playful
tone
,
and
with
an
arch
look
,
"
'
Tis
a
love
gift
to
Mistress
Aveline
Calveley
on
the
part
of
that
young
cavalier
.
"Whether
<EOS>
the
offering
,
thus
presented
,
would
have
been
accepted
may
be
questioned
;
but
it
was
never
destined
to
reach
her
for
whom
it
was
intended
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
was
the
flower
-
laden
crook
uplifted
,
than
a
man
of
singularly
stern
aspect
,
with
gray
hair
cut
close
to
the
head
,
grizzled
beard
,
and
military
habiliments
of
ancient
make
,
suddenly
appeared
behind
Aveline
,
and
seizing
the
nosegay
,
cast
it
angrily
and
contemptuously
forth
;
so
that
it
fell
at
Jocelyn
's
feet
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XV.Hugh
Calveley
.
<EOS>
Jocelyn
at
once
comprehended
that
the
person
who
had
thus
dashed
the
nosegay
to
the
ground
could
be
no
other
than
Hugh
Calveley
.
<EOS>
But
all
doubt
on
the
point
was
removed
by
Aveline
herself
who
exclaimed
in
a
reproachful
tone—"O
father
!
<EOS>
what
<EOS>
have
you
done?""What
have
I
done
?
"
<EOS>
the
Puritan
rejoined
,
speaking
in
a
loud
voice
,
as
if
desirous
that
his
words
should
reach
the
assemblage
outside
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
that
which
thou
thyself
should'st
have
done
,
Aveline
.
<EOS>
I
have
signified
my
abhorrence
of
this
vain
ceremonial
.
<EOS>
But
wherefore
do
I
find
you
here
?
<EOS>
This
is
no
fitting
sight
for
any
discreet
maiden
to
witness
;
and
little
<EOS>
did
I
think
that
daughter
of
mine
would
encourage
such
profane
displays
by
her
presence
.
<EOS>
Little
did
I
think
that
you
,
Aveline
,
would
look
on
and
smile
while
these
ignorant
and
benighted
folk
set
up
their
idol
,
piping
,
dancing
,
and
singing
around
it
as
the
Gentiles
did
at
the
dedications
of
their
deities
.
<EOS>
For
it
is
an
idol
they
have
set
up
,
and
they
have
become
like
the
heathens
,
worshippers
of
stocks
and
stones
.
<EOS>
Are
we
not
expressly
forbidden
by
the
Holy
Scriptures
to
make
unto
ourselves
idols
and
graven
images
?
<EOS>
The
sins
of
idolatry
and
superstition
will
assuredly
provoke
the
Divine
displeasure
,
and
kindle
the
fire
of
its
wrath
,
as
they
did
in
the
days
of
Moses
,
after
the
worshipping
of
the
Golden
Calf
by
the
Israelites
.
<EOS>
Thus
spake
offended
Heaven:—'Let
me
alone
that
my
wrath
may
wax
hot
against
them
,
and
that
I
may
consume
them
.
'
<EOS>
Grievously
will
the
Lord
punish
such
as
are
guilty
of
these
sins
,
for
hath
<EOS>
He
not
declared
,
as
we
read
in
Leviticus
,
'
I
will
make
your
cities
waste
,
and
bring
your
sanctuaries
to
desolation
?
'
<EOS>
And
be
assured
,
O
daughter
,
that
heavy
judgments
will
descend
upon
the
land
,
if
warning
be
not
taken
in
time
.
<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
dear
father
,
I
can
not
view
the
matter
in
the
same
serious
light
that
you
do
,
"
Aveline
rejoined
,
"
<EOS>
neither
do
I
think
evil
can
be
derived
from
pastimes
like
the
present
,
unless
by
the
evil
disposed
.
<EOS>
I
must
frankly
own
that
it
is
pleasant
to
me
to
witness
such
innocent
enjoyment
as
is
here
exhibited
;
while
as
to
yon
May
-
pole
,
with
its
pretty
floral
decorations
,
I
can
never
be
brought
to
regard
it
as
an
emblem
of
superstition
and
idolatry
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
had
you
commanded
me
to
refrain
from
the
sight
,
I
would
unhesitatingly
have
obeyed
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
thought
I
was
free
to
follow
my
own
inclinations
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
so
you
were
,
child
<EOS>
,
"
the
Puritan
rejoined
,
"
because
I
had
full
reliance
on
you
,
and
did
not
conceive
you
could
have
been
so
easily
beguiled
by
Satan
.
<EOS>
I
lament
to
find
you
can
not
discern
the
superstition
and
wickedness
lurking
within
this
false
,
though
fair
-
seeming
spectacle
.
<EOS>
Do
you
not
perceive
that
in
setting
up
this
wooden
idol
,
and
worshipping
it
,
these
people
are
returning
to
the
dark
and
sinful
practices
of
Paganism
of
which
it
is
an
undoubted
remnant
?
<EOS>
If
you
can
not
discern
this
,
I
will
make
it
manifest
to
you
anon
.
<EOS>
But
I
tell
you
now
briefly
,
"
he
continued
in
a
voice
of
thunder
,
calculated
to
reach
those
at
a
distance
,
"
that
the
ceremony
is
impious
;
that
those
who
take
part
in
it
are
idolaters
;
and
that
those
who
look
on
and
approve
are
participators
in
the
sin
;
yea
,
are
equal
in
sin
to
the
actors
themselves
.
<EOS>
"Hereupon
<EOS>
some
murmurs
of
displeasure
arose
among
the
crowd
,
but
they
were
instantly
checked
by
the
curiosity
generally
felt
to
hear
Aveline
's
reply
,
which
was
delivered
in
clear
and
gentle
,
but
distinct
tones
.
<EOS>
"Far
<EOS>
be
it
from
me
to
dispute
with
you
,
dear
father
,
"
she
said
;
"
and
it
is
with
reluctance
that
I
offer
an
opinion
at
all
adverse
to
your
own
.
<EOS>
But
it
seems
to
me
impossible
to
connect
these
pastimes
with
heathenish
and
superstitious
rites
;
for
though
they
may
bear
some
resemblance
to
ceremonials
performed
in
honour
of
the
goddesses
Maia
and
Flora
,
yet
,
such
creeds
being
utterly
forgotten
,
and
their
spirit
extinct
,
it
can
not
revive
in
sports
<EOS>
that
have
merely
reference
to
harmless
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
Not
one
,
I
am
sure
,
of
these
worthy
folk
<EOS>
has
the
slightest
thought
of
impiety
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
know
not
what
you
say
,
girl
,
"
the
Puritan
rejoined
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
evil
spirit
is
not
extinct
,
and
these
growing
abominations
prove
it
to
be
again
raising
its
baleful
crest
to
pollute
and
destroy
.
<EOS>
Listen
to
my
words
,
ye
vain
and
foolish
ones
!
"
<EOS>
he
continued
,
advancing
to
the
front
of
the
window
,
and
stretching
forth
his
arms
towards
the
assemblage
.
"
<EOS>
Repent
!
<EOS>
and
amend
your
ways
ere
it
be
too
late

<EOS>
Hew
down
the
offensive
idol
,
which
you
term
your
May
-
pole
,
and
cast
it
into
the
flames
!
<EOS>
Cease
your
wanton
sports
,
your
noisy
pipings
,
your
profane
dances
,
your
filthy
tipplings
.
<EOS>
Hear
what
the
prophet
Isaiah
saith:—'Wo
to
them
that
rise
up
early
in
the
morning
,
that
they
may
follow
strong
drink
.
'
<EOS>
And
again:—'Wo
to
the
drunkards
of
Ephraim
.
'
<EOS>
And
I
say
Wo
unto
you
also
,
for
you
are
like
unto
those
drunkards
.
'
<EOS>
O
do
not
this
abominable
thing
that
my
soul
hateth
.
'
<EOS>
Be
not
guilty
of
the
brutish
sin
of
drunkenness

<EOS>
Reflect
on
the
words
of
holy
Job,—'They
<EOS>
take
the
timbrel
and
harp
,
and
rejoice
at
the
sound
of
the
organ
.
<EOS>
They
spend
their
days
in
mirth
,
and
in
a
moment
go
down
,
to
the
grave
.
'
<EOS>
Hew
down
your
idol
I
say
again
.
<EOS>
Consume
it
utterly
,
and
scatter
its
ashes
to
the
winds
.
<EOS>
Strip
off
the
gaudes
and
tinsel
in
which
you
have
decked
your
foolish
May
Queen
.
<EOS>
Have
done
with
your
senseless
and
profane
mummeries
;
and
dismiss
your
Robin
Hoods
,
your
Friar
Tucks
,
and
your
Hobby
-
horses
.
<EOS>
Silence
your
pestilent
minstrels
,
and
depart
peaceably
to
your
own
homes
.
<EOS>
Abandon
your
sinful
courses
,
or
assuredly
'
the
Lord
will
come
upon
you
unawares
,
and
cut
you
in
sunder
,
and
appoint
your
portion
among
unbelievers
.
<EOS>
'"So
<EOS>
sonorous
was
the
voice
of
the
Puritan
,
so
impressive
were
his
looks
and
gestures
,
that
his
address
commanded
general
attention
.
<EOS>
While
he
continued
to
speak
,
the
sports
were
wholly
stopped
.
<EOS>
The
minstrels
left
off
playing
to
listen
to
him
,
and
the
mummers
suspended
their
merry
evolutions
round
the
May
-
pole
.
<EOS>
The
poor
denounced
May
Queen
,
who
on
the
rejection
of
her
nosegay
had
flown
back
to
Jocelyn
,
<EOS>
now
looked
doubly
disconcerted
at
this
direct
attack
upon
her
and
her
finery
,
and
pouted
her
pretty
lips
in
vexation
.
<EOS>
Dick
Taverner
,
who
stood
by
her
side
,
seemed
disposed
to
resent
the
affront
,
and
shook
his
fist
menacingly
at
the
Puritan
.
<EOS>
Jocelyn
himself
was
perplexed
and
annoyed
,
for
though
inclined
to
take
part
with
the
assemblage
,
the
growing
interest
he
felt
in
Aveline
forbade
all
interference

CHAPTER
XVI.Of
the
Sign
Given
by
the
Puritan
to
the
Assemblage
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
a
great
crowd
had
collected
beneath
the
window
,
and
though
no
interruption
was
offered
to
the
speaker
,
it
was
easy
to
discern
from
the
angry
countenances
of
his
hearers
<EOS>
what
was
the
effect
of
the
address
upon
them
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
done
,
Hugh
Calveley
folded
his
arms
upon
his
breast
,
and
sternly
regarded
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
He
was
well
-
stricken
in
years
,
as
his
grizzled
hair
and
beard
denoted
,
but
neither
was
his
strength
impaired
,
nor
the
fire
of
his
eye
dimmed
.
<EOS>
Squarely
built
,
with
hard
and
somewhat
massive
features
,
strongly
stamped
with
austerity
,
he
was
distinguished
by
a
soldier
-
like
deportment
and
manner
,
while
his
bronzed
countenance
,
which
bore
upon
it
more
than
one
cicatrice
,
showed
he
must
have
been
exposed
to
foreign
suns
,
and
seen
much
service
.
<EOS>
There
was
great
determination
about
the
mouth
,
and
about
the
physiognomy
generally
,
while
at
the
same
time
there
was
something
of
the
wildness
of
fanaticism
in
his
looks
.
<EOS>
He
was
habited
in
a
buff
jerkin
,
with
a
brown
,
lackered
,
breast
-
plate
over
it
,
thigh
-
pieces
of
a
similar
colour
and
similar
material
,
and
stout
leathern
boots
.
<EOS>
A
broad
belt
with
a
heavy
sword
attached
to
,
it
crossed
his
breast
,
and
round
his
neck
was
a
plain
falling
band
.
<EOS>
You
could
not
regard
Hugh
Calveley
without
feeling
he
was
a
man
to
die
a
martyr
in
any
cause
he
had
espoused
.
<EOS>
A
deep
groan
was
now
directed
against
him
.
<EOS>
But
it
moved
not
a
muscle
of
his
rigid
countenance
.
<EOS>
Jocelyn
began
to
fear
from
the
menacing
looks
of
the
crowd
that
some
violence
might
be
attempted
,
and
he
endeavoured
to
check
it
.
<EOS>
"Bear
<EOS>
with
him
,
worthy
friends
<EOS>
,
"
he
cried
,
"
he
means
you
well
,
though
he
may
reprove
you
somewhat
too
sharply
.
<EOS>
""Beshrew
him
for
an
envious
railer
<EOS>
,
"
cried
a
miller
,
"
he
mars
all
our
pleasures
with
his
peevish
humours
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
us
all
as
discontented
with
the
world
as
himself
—
but
we
know
better
.
<EOS>
He
will
not
let
us
have
our
lawful
sports
as
enjoined
by
the
King
himself
on
Sundays
,
and
he
now
tries
to
interfere
with
our
recreations
on
holidays
.
<EOS>
A
pest
upon
him
for
a
cankerbitten
churl!""His
sullen
looks
are
enough
to
turn
all
the
cream
in
the
village
sour
,
"
observed
an
old
dame
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
doth
he
not
betake
himself
to
the
conventicle
and
preach
there
?
<EOS>
"
old
Greenford
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
we
have
all
these
bitter
texts
of
scripture
thrown
at
our
heads
?
<EOS>
Why
should
we
be
likened
to
the
drunkards
of
Ephraim
because
we
drink
our
Whitsun
-
ales
?
<EOS>
I
have
tasted
nothing
more
than
my
morning
cup
as
yet
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
should
our
May
-
pole
be
termed
an
idol
?
<EOS>
Answer
me
that
,
good
grandsire
?
<EOS>
"
Gillian
demanded
.
<EOS>
"Nay
,
let
him
who
called
it
<EOS>
so
answer
thee
,
child
,
<EOS>
for
I
can
not
,
"
the
old
farmer
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
see
naught
idolatrous
in
it
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
should
our
pretty
May
Queen
be
despoiled
of
her
ornaments
because
they
please
not
his
fanatical
taste
?
"
<EOS>
Dick
Taverner
demanded
.
<EOS>
"
For
my
part
I
can
discern
no
difference
between
a
Puritan
and
a
knave
,
and
I
would
hang
both
.
<EOS>
"This
sally
met
with
a
favourable
reception
from
the
crowd
,
and
a
voice
exclaimed—"Ay
<EOS>
,
hang
all
knavish
Puritans
.
"Again
<EOS>
Hugh
Calveley
lifted
up
his
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Think
not
to
make
me
afraid
,
"
he
cried
;
"
I
have
confronted
armed
hosts
with
boldness
when
engaged
in
a
worse
cause
than
this
,
and
I
am
not
likely
to
give
way
before
a
base
rabble
,
now
that
I
have
become
a
soldier
of
Christ
and
fight
his
battles
.
<EOS>
I
repeat
my
warnings
to
you
,
and
will
not
hold
my
peace
till
you
give
heed
to
them
.
<EOS>
Continue
not
in
the
sins
of
the
Gentiles
lest
their
punishment
come
upon
you
.
<EOS>
These
are
fearful
times
we
live
in
.
<EOS>
London
is
become
another
Nineveh
,
and
will
be
devoured
by
flames
like
that
great
city
.
<EOS>
It
is
full
of
corruption
and
debauchery
,
of
oppressions
,
thefts
,
and
deceits
.
<EOS>
With
the
prophet
Nahum
<EOS>
I
exclaim—'Wo
to
the
city
<EOS>
,
it
is
full
of
lies
and
robbery
!
<EOS>
What
griping
usury
,
what
extortion
are
practised
within
it
!
<EOS>
What
fraud
,
what
injustice
,
what
misrule
!
<EOS>
But
the
Lord
's
anger
will
be
awakened
against
it
.
<EOS>
Palaces
of
kings
are
of
no
more
account
in
His
eyes
than
cottages
of
peasants.—He
cutteth
off
the
spirits
of
Princes
:
he
is
terrible
to
the
Kings
of
the
earth
.
'
<EOS>
He
knoweth
no
difference
between
them
that
sit
on
thrones
,
and
those
that
go
from
door
to
door
.
<EOS>
For
what
saith
the
prophet
Isaiah?—'I
will
punish
the
stout
heart
of
the
King
of
Assyria
,
and
the
glory
of
his
high
looks
.
'
<EOS>
Let
the
Great
Ones
of
the
land
be
warned
as
well
as
the
meanest
,
or
judgment
will
come
upon
them
.
<EOS>
""Methinks
that
smacks
of
treason
,
"
cried
Dick
Taverner
.
<EOS>
"
Our
Puritan
has
quitted
us
poor
fowl
to
fly
at
higher
game
.
<EOS>
Hark
ye
,
Sir
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
to
Hugh
Calveley
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
dare
utter
such
words
as
those
in
the
King
's
presence
.
<EOS>
""Thou
<EOS>
art
mistaken
,
friend
,
"
the
other
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
purpose
to
warn
him
in
terms
strong
as
those
I
have
just
used
.
<EOS>
Why
should
I
hold
my
peace
when
I
have
a
mission
from
on
high
?
<EOS>
I
shall
speak
to
the
King
as
Nathan
spoke
to
David
.
<EOS>
""He
speaks
like
a
prophet
<EOS>
,
"
cried
the
miller
;
"
I
begin
to
have
faith
in
him
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
the
iniquities
of
London
are
fearful
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
he
preach
against
extortioners
and
usurers
<EOS>
only
,
I
am
with
him
,
"
Dick
Taverner
said
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
rid
London
of
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
and
his
peers
he
will
do
good
service
—
still
better
,
if
he
will
put
down
corruption
and
injustice
as
exhibited
in
the
Court
of
Star
-
Chamber
—
eh
,
Master
Jocelyn
Mounchensey?"At
<EOS>
the
mention
of
this
name
the
Puritan
appeared
greatly
surprised
,
and
looked
round
inquiringly
,
till
his
eye
alighted
upon
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
After
regarding
him
for
a
moment
fixedly
,
he
demanded—"Art
<EOS>
thou
Jocelyn
Mounchensey?"The
young
man
,
equally
surprised
,
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"The
son
of
Sir
Ferdinando
Mounchensey
,
of
Massingham
,
in
Norfolk
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
Puritan
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
same
,
"
Jocelyn
answered
.
<EOS>
"Thy
<EOS>
father
was
my
nearest
and
dearest
friend
,
young
man
,
"
Hugh
Calveley
said
;
"
and
thy
father
's
son
shall
be
welcome
to
my
dwelling
.
<EOS>
Enter
,
I
pray
of
you
.
<EOS>
Yet
pause
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
word
more
to
declare
to
these
people
.
<EOS>
Ye
heed
not
my
words
,
and
make
a
mock
of
me
,
"
he
continued
,
addressing
the
assemblage
:
"
<EOS>
but
I
will
give
you
a
sign
that
I
have
spoken
the
truth
.
<EOS>
""He
will
bring
the
devil
among
us
,
I
trow
,
"
cried
Dick

"'Tis
to

he
will
not
split
the

pole

"
said
the
miller
.
<EOS>
"Nor
<EOS>
spoil
our
Whitsun

ales
,
"
cried
old
Greenford
.
<EOS>
"Nor

lame
our

said
one
of
the
mummers
.
<EOS>
"Nor
<EOS>
rob
me
of
my
wreath

garlands

said
Gillian

<EOS>
"That
<EOS>
he

not
<EOS>
,
I
promise
you
,
fair
May
Queen

"
<EOS>
Dick
Tavernor
rejoined
,
gallantly
.
<EOS>
"I
will
do
none
of
these
things
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
harm
you
,
even
if
I
had
the
power
,
"
the
Puritan
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
discharge
a
bolt
against
the
head
of
yon
idol
,
"
he
added
,
pointing
towards
the
flower
-
crowned
summit
of
the
May
-
pole
;
"
and
if
I
break
its
neck
and
cast
it
down
,
ye
will
own
that
a
higher
hand
than
mine
directs
the
blow
,
and
that
the
superstitious
symbol
ought
not
to
be
left
standing
.
<EOS>
""As
to
what
we
may
do
,
or
what
we
may
acknowledge
,
we
will
give
no
promise
,
Master
Hugh
Calveley
,
"
rejoined
old
Greenford
.
<EOS>
"
But
e'en
let
fly
thy
bolt
,
if
thou
wilt
.
<EOS>
"Some
dissent
was
offered
to
this
singular
proposition
,
but
the
majority
of
voices
overruled
it
;
and
withdrawing
for
a
moment
,
Hugh
Calveley
returned
with
an
arbalist
,
which
he
proceeded
deliberately
to
arm
in
view
of
the
crowd
,
and
then
placed
a
quarrel
within
it
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
the
name
of
the
Lord
,
who
cast
down
the
golden
idol
made
by
Aaron
and
the
Israelites
<EOS>
,
I
launch
this
bolt
,
"
he
cried
,
as
he
took
aim
,
and
liberated
the
cord
.
<EOS>
The
short
,
iron
-
headed
,
square
-
pointed
arrow
whizzed
through
the
air
,
and
,
by
the
mischief
it
did
as
it
hit
its
mark
,
seemed
to
confirm
the
Puritan
's
denunciation
.
<EOS>
Striking
the
May
-
pole
precisely
at
the
summit
,
it
shattered
the
wood
,
and
brought
down
the
floral
crown
surmounting
it
,
as
well
as
the
topmost
streamers
.
<EOS>
The
spectators
stared
aghast
.
<EOS>
"Be
warned
by
this
,
"
thundered
Hugh
Calveley
,
with
gloomy
triumph
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
idol
is
smitten
—
not
by
my
hand
,
but
by
His
who
will
chastise
your
wickedness
.
"Whereupon
<EOS>
he
closed
the
window
,
and
departed
.
<EOS>
Presently
afterwards
,
the
door
was
opened
by
an
old
,
grave
-
looking
,
decently
-
clad
serving
-
man
.
<EOS>
Addressing
Jocelyn
,
who
had
already
dismounted
and
given
his
horse
in
charge
to
the
youth
engaged
for
a
similar
purpose
by
Dick
Taverner
,
this
personage
invited
him
,
in
his
master
's
name
,
to
enter
;
and
,
with
a
heart
throbbing
with
emotion
,
the
young
man
complied
.
<EOS>
Chance
seemed
to
befriend
him
in
a
way
he
could
never
have
anticipated
;
and
he
now
hoped
to
obtain
an
interview
with
Aveline
.
<EOS>
His
conductor
led
him
through
a
passage
to
a
large
chamber
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
with
windows
looking
upon
a
garden
.
<EOS>
The
room
was
panelled
with
dark
shining
oak
,
had
a
polished
floor
,
an
immense
chimney
-
piece
,
and
a
moulded
ceiling
.
<EOS>
Within
it
were
a
few
high
-
backed
chairs
,
and
some
other
cumbrous
furniture
,
while
on
an
oak
table
at
the
side
,
was
spread
the
simple
morning
repast
of
the
Puritan
and
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
But
all
these
things
were
lost
upon
Jocelyn
,
who
had
eyes
only
for
one
object
.
<EOS>
She
was
there
,
and
how
lovely
she
appeared
!
<EOS>
How
exquisite
in
figure
—
how
faultless
in
feature
!
<EOS>
Some
little
embarrassment
was
discoverable
in
her
manner
as
the
young
man
entered
;
but
it
quickly
disappeared
.
<EOS>
Her
father
was
with
her
;
and
advancing
towards
Jocelyn
,
he
took
him
kindly
by
the
hand
,
and
bade
him
welcome
.
<EOS>
Then
,
without
relinquishing
his
grasp
,
he
presented
the
young
man
to
his
daughter
,
saying—"This
is
Jocelyn
,
the
son
of
my
dear
departed
friend
,
Sir
Ferdinando
Mounchensey
.
<EOS>
Some
inscrutable
design
of
Providence
has
brought
him
hither
,
and
right
glad
I
am
to
behold
him
.
<EOS>
Years
ago
,
his
father
rendered
me
a
signal
service
,
which
I
requited
as
I
best
could
;
and
there
is
nothing
I
would
not
gladly
do
for
the
son
of
such
a
friend
.
<EOS>
You
will
esteem
him
accordingly
,
Aveline
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
fail
in
my
duty
,
father
,
"
she
replied
,
blushing
slightly
.
<EOS>
And
Jocelyn
thought
these
words
were
the
sweetest
he
had
ever
heard
pronounced
.
<EOS>
"I
would
pray
you
to
break
your
fast
with
us
,
if
our
simple
fare
will
content
you
,
"
said
Hugh
Calveley
,
pointing
to
the
table
.
<EOS>
"I
am
not
over
-
dainty
,
and
shall
do
ample
justice
to
whatever
is
set
before
me
,
"
Jocelyn
replied
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"It
is
well
,
"
said
the
Puritan
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
find
the
son
of
my
old
friend
is
not
a
slave
to
his
appetites
,
as
are
most
of
the
young
men
of
this
generation
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
they
approached
the
board
;
and
,
a
lengthy
grace
being
pronounced
by
Hugh
Calveley
,
Jocelyn
sat
down
by
the
side
of
Aveline
,
scarcely
able
to
believe
in
the
reality
of
his
own
happiness
—
so
like
a
dream
it
seemed
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XVII.A
Rash
Promise
.
<EOS>
During
the
slender
repast
,
Jocelyn
,
in
reply
to
the
inquiries
of
the
Puritan
,
explained
the
two
-
fold
motive
of
his
coming
to
London
;
namely
,
the
desire
of
taking
vengeance
on
his
father
's
enemies
,
and
the
hope
of
obtaining
some
honourable
employment
,
such
as
a
gentleman
might
accept
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
chances
in
the
latter
respect
are
not
very
great
,
"
he
said
,
"
seeing
I
have
no
powerful
friends
to
aid
me
in
my
endeavours
,
and
I
must
consequently
trust
to
fortune
.
<EOS>
But
as
regards
my
enemies
,
if
I
can
only
win
an
audience
of
the
King
,
and
plead
my
cause
before
him
,
I
do
not
think
he
will
deny
me
justice
.
""Justice
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
Puritan
with
deep
scorn
.
"
<EOS>
James
Stuart
knows
it
not
.
<EOS>
An
archhypocrite
,
and
perfidious
as
hypocritical
,
he
holdeth
as
a
maxim
that
Dissimulation
is
necessary
to
a
Ruler
.
<EOS>
He
has
the
cowardice
and
the
ferocity
of
the
hyaena
.
<EOS>
He
will
promise
fairly
,
but
his
deeds
will
falsify
his
words
.
<EOS>
Recollect
how
his
Judas
kiss
betrayed
Somerset
.
<EOS>
Recollect
his
conduct
towards
the
Gowries
.
<EOS>
But
imagine
not
,
because
you
have
been
evil
intreated
and
oppressed
,
that
the
King
will
redress
your
wrongs
,
and
reinstate
you
in
your
fallen
position
.
<EOS>
Rather
will
he
take
part
with
the
usurers
and
extortioners
who
have
deprived
you
of
your
inheritance
.
<EOS>
How
many
poor
wretches
doth
<EOS>
he
daily
condemn
to
the
same
lingering
agonies
and
certain
destruction
that
he
doomed
your
father
.
<EOS>
Lamentable
as
is
the
good
Sir
Ferdinando
's
case
,
it
stands
not
alone
.
<EOS>
It
is
one
of
many
.
<EOS>
And
many
,
many
more
will
be
added
to
the
list
,
if
this
tyrannical
Herodias
be
suffered
to
govern
.
<EOS>
"And
as
if
goaded
by
some
stinging
thought
,
that
drove
him
nigh
distracted
,
Hugh
Calveley
arose
,
and
paced
to
and
fro
within
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
His
brow
became
gloomier
and
his
visage
sterner
.
<EOS>
"Bear
<EOS>
with
him
,
good
Master
Jocelyn
,
"
Aveline
said
in
a
low
tone
.
"
<EOS>
He
hath
been
unjustly
treated
by
the
King
,
and
as
you
see
can
ill
brook
the
usage
.
<EOS>
Bear
with
him
,
I
pray
of
you
.
<EOS>
"Jocelyn
<EOS>
had
no
time
to
make
reply
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
checking
himself
,
and
fixing
his
earnest
gaze
upon
the
young
man
,
the
Puritan
said—"Give
ear
to
me
,
my
son
.
<EOS>
If
I
desired
to
inflame
your
breast
with
rage
against
this
tyrant
,
I
should
need
only
to
relate
one
instance
of
his
cruelty
and
injustice
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
friend
—
a
very
dear
friend
,
"
he
continued
,
in
a
tone
of
deep
pathos—"confined
within
the
Fleet
Prison
by
a
decree
of
the
Star
-
Chamber
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
me
as
a
brother
,
and
to
see
him
gradually
pining
away
cut
me
to
the
soul
.
<EOS>
Proud
by
nature
,
he
refused
to
abase
himself
to
his
oppressor
,
and
could
not
be
brought
to
acknowledge
wrongs
he
had
never
committed
.
<EOS>
Pardon
,
therefore
,
was
denied
him
—
not
pardon
merely
,
but
all
mitigation
of
suffering
.
<EOS>
My
friend
had
been
wealthy
;
but
heavy
fines
and
penalties
had
stripped
him
of
his
possessions
,
and
brought
him
to
destitution
.
<EOS>
Lord
of
an
ancient
hall
,
with
woods
and
lands
around
it
,
wherein
he
could
ride
for
hours
without
quitting
his
own
domains
,
his
territories
were
now
narrowed
to
a
few
yards
;
while
one
dark
,
dreary
chamber
was
alone
accorded
him
.
<EOS>
Finding
he
must
necessarily
perish
,
if
left
to
rot
there
,
I
prevailed
upon
him
(
not
without
much
reluctance
on
his
part
)
to
petition
the
King
for
liberation
;
and
was
myself
the
bearer
of
his
prayer
.
<EOS>
Earnestly
pleading
the
cause
of
the
unfortunate
man
,
and
representing
his
forlorn
condition
,
I
besought
his
Majesty
's
gracious
intercession
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
had
wearied
the
royal
ear
with
entreaties
,
the
sharp
reply
was—'Doth
<EOS>
he
make
submission
?
<EOS>
Will
he
confess
his
offence
?
'
<EOS>
And
as
I
could
only
affirm
,
that
as
he
was
guilty
of
no
crime
,
so
he
could
confess
none
,
the
King
returned
me
the
petition
,
coldly
observing—'The
dignity
of
our
Court
of
Star
-
Chamber
must
be
maintained
before
all
things
.
<EOS>
He
hath
been
guilty
of
contempt
towards
it
,
and
must
purge
him
of
the
offence
.
'
'
<EOS>
But
the
man
will
die
,
Sire
,
'
I
urged
,
'
if
he
be
not
removed
from
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
His
prison
-
lodging
is
near
a
foul
ditch
,
and
he
is
sick
with
fever
.
<EOS>
Neither
can
he
have
such
aid
of
medicine
or
of
nursing
as
his
case
demands
.
'
'
<EOS>
The
greater
reason
he
should
relieve
himself
by
speedy
acknowledgment
of
the
justice
of
his
sentence
,
'
said
the
King
.
'
<EOS>
The
matter
rests
not
with
us
,
but
with
himself
.
'
'
<EOS>
But
he
is
a
gentleman
,
Sire
,
'
I
persisted
,
'
to
whom
truth
is
dearer
than
life
,
and
who
would
rather
languish
in
misery
for
thrice
the
term
he
is
likely
to
last
,
than
forfeit
his
own
self
-
esteem
by
admitting
falsehood
and
injustice
.
'
'
<EOS>
Then
let
him
perish
in
his
pride
and
obstinacy
,
'
cried
the
King
impatiently
.
<EOS>
And
thereupon
he
dismissed
me
.
<EOS>
""O
<EOS>
Sir
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Jocelyn
,
rising
and
throwing
,
his
arms
round
the
Puritan
's
neck
;
"
you
,
then
,
were
the
friend
who
tended
my
poor
father
in
his
last
moments
.
<EOS>
Heaven
bless
you
for
it!""Yes
,
Jocelyn
<EOS>
,
it
was
I
who
heard
your
father
's
latest
sigh
,
"
the
Puritan
replied
,
returning
his
embrace
,
"
and
your
own
name
was
breathed
with
it
.
<EOS>
His
thoughts
were
of
his
son
far
away
—
too
young
to
share
his
distresses
,
or
to
comprehend
them
.
<EOS>
""Alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Jocelyn
mournfully
.
<EOS>
"Lament
<EOS>
not
for
your
father
,
Jocelyn
,
"
said
the
Puritan
,
solemnly
;
"
he
is
reaping
the
reward
of
his
earthly
troubles
in
heaven
!
<EOS>
Be
comforted
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
The
tyrant
can
no
longer
oppress
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
beyond
the
reach
of
his
malice
.
<EOS>
He
can
be
arraigned
at
no
more
unjust
tribunals
.
<EOS>
He
is
where
no
cruel
and
perfidious
princes
,
no
iniquitous
judges
,
no
griping
extortioners
shall
ever
enter
.
<EOS>
"Jocelyn
<EOS>
endeavoured
to
speak
,
but
his
emotion
overpowered
him
.
<EOS>
"I
have
already
told
you
that
your
father
rendered
me
a
service
impossible
to
be
adequately
requited
,
"
pursued
the
Puritan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
that
service
was
I
will
one
day
inform
you
.
<EOS>
Suffice
it
now
,
that
it
bound
me
to
him
in
chains
firmer
than
brass
.
<EOS>
Willingly
would
I
have
laid
down
my
life
for
him
,
if
he
had
desired
it
.
<EOS>
Gladly
would
I
have
taken
his
place
in
the
Fleet
prison
,
if
that
could
have
procured
him
liberation
.
<EOS>
Unable
to
do
either
,
I
watched
over
him
while
he
lived
—
and
buried
him
when
dead
.
<EOS>
""O
<EOS>
Sir
,
you
have
bound
me
to
you
as
strongly
as
you
were
bound
to
my
father
,
"
cried
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"
For
the
devotion
shown
to
him
,
I
hold
myself
eternally
your
debtor
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
Puritan
regarded
him
steadfastly
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"What
if
I
were
to
put
these
professions
to
the
test
?
"
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
so
,
"
Jocelyn
replied
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"
My
life
is
yours!""Your
life
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Hugh
Calveley
,
grasping
his
arm
almost
fiercely
,
while
his
eye
blazed
.
<EOS>
"
Consider
what
you
offer
.
<EOS>
""I
need
not
consider
,
"
Jocelyn
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
my
life
is
yours
,
if
you
demand
it
.
<EOS>
""Perhaps
I
shall
demand
it
,
"
cried
Hugh
Calveley
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
""Demand
it
when
you
will
,
"
Jocelyn
said
.
<EOS>
"Father
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Aveline
interposed
,
"
do
not
let
the
young
man
bind
himself
by
this
promise
.
<EOS>
Release
him
,
I
pray
of
you
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
promise
can
not
be
recalled
,
my
child
,
"
the
Puritan
replied
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
shall
never
claim
its
fulfilment
save
for
some
high
and
holy
purpose
.
<EOS>
""Are
<EOS>
you
sure
your
purpose
is
holy
,
father
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Aveline
said
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
mean
you
,
child
?
"
cried
Hugh
Calveley
,
knitting
his
brows
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
but
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
Heaven
,
appointed
to
do
its
work
;
and
as
directed
,
so
I
must
act
.
<EOS>
Heaven
may
make
me
the
scourge
of
the
oppressor
and
evil
-
doer
,
or
the
sword
to
slay
the
tyrant
.
<EOS>
I
may
die
a
martyr
for
my
faith
,
or
do
battle
for
it
with
carnal
weapons
.
<EOS>
For
all
these
I
am
ready
;
resigning
myself
to
the
will
of
God
.
<EOS>
Is
it
for
nothing
,
think'st
thou
,
that
this
young
man
—
the
son
of
my
dear
departed
friend
—
has
been
brought
hither
at
this
particular
conjuncture
?
<EOS>
Is
it
for
nothing
that
,
wholly
unsolicited
,
he
has
placed
his
life
at
my
disposal
,
and
in
doing
so
has
devoted
himself
to
a
great
cause
?
<EOS>
Like
myself
he
hath
wrongs
to
avenge
,
and
the
Lord
of
Hosts
will
give
him
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
""But
not
in
the
way
you
propose
,
father
<EOS>
,
"
Aveline
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
Heaven
will
assuredly
give
you
both
satisfaction
for
the
wrongs
you
have
endured
;
but
it
must
choose
its
own
means
of
doing
so
,
and
its
own
time
.
<EOS>
""It
hath
chosen
the
means
,
and
the
time
is
coming
quickly
,
"
cried
the
Puritan
,
his
eye
again
kindling
with
fanatical
light
.
"
<EOS>
'
The
Lord
will
cut
off
from
Israel
head
and
tail
.
<EOS>
'""These
things
are
riddles
to
me
,
"
observed
Jocelyn
,
who
had
listened
to
what
was
passing
with
great
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
solicit
an
explanation?""You
shall
have
it
,
my
son
,
"
Hugh
Calveley
replied
.
<EOS>
"
But
not
now
.
<EOS>
My
hour
for
solitary
prayer
and
self
-
communion
is
come
,
and
I
must
withdraw
to
my
chamber
.
<EOS>
Go
forth
into
the
garden
,
Jocelyn
—
and
do
thou
attend
him
,
Aveline
.
<EOS>
I
will
join
you
when
my
devotions
are
ended
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
he
quitted
the
room
,
while
the
youthful
pair
went
forth
as
enjoined
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XVIII.How
the
promise
was
cancelled
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
large
garden
,
once
fairly
laid
out
and
planted
,
but
now
sadly
neglected
.
<EOS>
The
broad
terrace
walk
was
overgrown
with
weeds
;
the
stone
steps
and
the
carved
balusters
were
broken
in
places
,
and
covered
with
moss
;
the
once
smooth
lawn
was
unconscious
of
the
scythe
;
the
parterres
had
lost
their
quaint
devices
;
and
the
knots
of
flowers
—
tre
-
foil
,
cinque
-
foil
,
diamond
,
and
cross
-
bow
—
were
no
longer
distinguishable
in
their
original
shapes
.
<EOS>
The
labyrinths
of
the
maze
were
inextricably
tangled
,
and
the
long
green
alleys
wanted
clearing
out
.
<EOS>
But
all
this
neglect
passed
unnoticed
by
Jocelyn
,
so
completely
was
he
engrossed
by
the
fair
creature
at
his
side
.
<EOS>
Even
the
noise
of
the
May
Games
,
which
,
temporarily
interrupted
by
Hugh
Calveley
,
had
recommenced
with
greater
vigour
than
ever
—
the
ringing
of
the
church
bells
,
the
shouts
of
the
crowd
,
and
the
sounds
of
the
merry
minstrelsy
,
scarcely
reached
his
ear
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
he
experienced
those
delicious
sensations
which
new
-
born
love
excites
within
the
breast
;
and
the
enchantment
operated
upon
him
so
rapidly
and
so
strongly
,
that
he
was
overpowered
by
its
spell
almost
before
aware
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
that
he
had
never
really
lived
till
this
moment
;
never
,
at
least
,
comprehended
the
bliss
afforded
by
existence
in
the
companionship
of
a
being
able
to
awaken
the
transports
he
now
experienced
.
<EOS>
A
new
world
seemed
suddenly
opened
to
him
,
full
of
love
,
hope
,
sunshine
,
of
which
he
and
Aveline
were
the
sole
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
his
life
had
been
devoid
of
any
great
emotion
.
<EOS>
The
one
feeling
latterly
pervading
it
had
been
a
sense
of
deep
wrong
,
coupled
with
the
thirst
of
vengeance
.
<EOS>
No
tenderer
influence
had
softened
his
almost
rugged
nature
;
and
his
breast
continued
arid
as
the
desert
.
<EOS>
Now
the
rock
had
been
stricken
,
and
the
living
waters
gushed
forth
abundantly
.
<EOS>
Not
that
in
Norfolk
,
and
even
in
the
remote
part
of
the
county
where
his
life
had
been
passed
,
female
beauty
was
rare
.
<EOS>
Nowhere
,
indeed
,
is
the
flower
of
loveliness
more
thickly
sown
than
in
that
favoured
part
of
our
isle
.
<EOS>
But
all
such
young
damsels
as
he
had
beheld
had
failed
to
move
him
;
and
if
any
shaft
had
been
aimed
at
his
breast
it
had
fallen
wide
of
the
mark
.
<EOS>
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
was
not
one
of
those
highly
susceptible
natures
—
quick
to
receive
an
impression
,
quicker
to
lose
it
.
<EOS>
Neither
would
he
have
been
readily
caught
by
the
lures
spread
for
youth
by
the
designing
of
the
sex
.
<EOS>
Imbued
with
something
of
the
antique
spirit
of
chivalry
,
which
yet
,
though
but
slightly
,
influenced
the
age
in
which
he
lived
,
he
was
ready
and
able
to
pay
fervent
homage
to
his
mistress
's
sovereign
beauty
(
supposing
he
had
one
)
,
and
maintain
its
supremacy
against
all
questioners
,
but
utterly
incapable
of
worshipping
at
any
meaner
shrine
.
<EOS>
Heart
-
whole
,
therefore
,
when
he
encountered
the
Puritan
's
daughter
,
he
felt
that
in
her
he
had
found
an
object
he
had
long
sought
,
to
whom
he
could
devote
himself
heart
and
soul
;
a
maiden
whose
beauty
was
without
peer
,
and
whose
mental
qualities
corresponded
with
her
personal
attractions
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
it
a
delusion
under
which
he
laboured
.
<EOS>
Aveline
Calveley
was
all
his
imagination
painted
her
.
<EOS>
Purity
of
heart
,
gentleness
of
disposition
,
intellectual
endowments
,
were
as
clearly
revealed
by
her
speaking
countenance
as
the
innermost
depths
of
a
fountain
are
by
the
pellucid
medium
through
which
they
are
viewed
.
<EOS>
Hers
was
a
virgin
heart
,
which
,
like
his
own
,
had
received
no
previous
impression
.
<EOS>
Love
for
her
father
alone
had
swayed
her
;
though
all
strong
demonstrations
of
filial
affection
had
been
checked
by
that
father
's
habitually
stern
manner
.
<EOS>
Brought
up
by
a
female
relative
in
Cheshire
,
who
had
taken
charge
of
her
on
her
mother
's
death
,
which
had
occurred
during
her
infancy
,
she
had
known
little
of
her
father
till
late
years
,
when
she
had
come
to
reside
with
him
,
and
,
though
devout
by
nature
,
she
could
ill
reconcile
herself
to
the
gloomy
notions
of
religion
he
entertained
,
or
to
the
ascetic
mode
of
life
he
practised
.
<EOS>
With
no
desire
to
share
in
the
pomps
and
vanities
of
life
,
she
could
not
be
persuaded
that
cheerfulness
was
incompatible
with
righteousness
;
nor
could
all
the
railings
she
heard
against
them
make
her
hate
those
who
differed
from
her
in
religious
opinions
.
<EOS>
Still
she
made
no
complaint
.
<EOS>
Entirely
obedient
to
her
father
's
will
,
she
accommodated
herself
,
as
far
as
she
could
,
to
the
rule
of
life
prescribed
by
him
.
<EOS>
Aware
of
his
pertinacity
of
opinion
,
she
seldom
or
ever
argued
a
point
with
him
,
even
if
she
thought
right
might
be
on
her
side
;
holding
it
better
to
maintain
peace
by
submission
,
than
to
hazard
wrath
by
disputation
.
<EOS>
The
discussion
on
the
May
Games
was
an
exception
to
her
ordinary
conduct
,
and
formed
one
of
the
few
instances
in
which
she
had
ventured
to
assert
her
own
opinion
in
opposition
to
that
of
her
father
.
<EOS>
Of
late
,
indeed
,
she
had
felt
great
uneasiness
about
him
.
<EOS>
Much
changed
,
he
seemed
occupied
by
some
dark
,
dread
thought
,
which
partially
revealed
itself
in
wrathful
exclamations
and
muttered
menaces
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
believe
himself
chosen
by
Heaven
as
an
instrument
of
vengeance
against
oppression
;
and
her
fears
were
excited
lest
he
might
commit
some
terrible
act
under
this
fatal
impression
.
<EOS>
She
was
the
more
confirmed
in
the
idea
from
the
eagerness
with
which
he
had
grasped
at
Jocelyn
's
rash
promise
,
and
she
determined
to
put
the
young
man
upon
his
guard
.
<EOS>
If
,
in
order
to
satisfy
the
reader
's
curiosity
,
we
are
obliged
to
examine
the
state
of
Aveline
's
heart
,
in
reference
to
Jocelyn
,
we
must
state
candidly
that
no
such
ardent
flame
was
kindled
within
it
as
burnt
in
the
breast
of
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
That
such
a
flame
might
arise
was
very
possible
,
nay
even
probable
,
seeing
that
the
sparks
of
love
were
there
;
and
material
for
combustion
was
by
no
means
wanting
.
<EOS>
All
that
was
required
was
,
that
those
sparks
should
be
gently
fanned
—
not
heedlessly
extinguished
.
<EOS>
Little
was
said
by
the
two
young
persons
,
as
they
slowly
paced
the
terrace
.
<EOS>
Both
felt
embarrassed
:
Jocelyn
longing
to
give
utterance
to
his
feelings
,
but
restrained
by
timidity
—
<EOS>
Aveline
trembling
lest
more
might
be
said
than
she
ought
to
hear
,
or
if
obliged
to
hear
,
than
she
could
rightly
answer
.
<EOS>
Thus
they
walked
on
in
silence
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
a
silence
more
eloquent
than
words
,
since
each
comprehended
what
the
other
felt
.
<EOS>
How
much
they
would
have
said
was
proclaimed
by
the
impossibility
they
found
of
saying
anything!At
length
,
Jocelyn
stopped
,
and
plucking
a
flower
,
observed
,
as
he
proffered
it
for
her
acceptance
,
"
My
first
offering
to
you
was
rejected
.
<EOS>
May
this
be
more
fortunate
.
<EOS>
""Make
me
a
promise
,
and
I
will
accept
it
<EOS>
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"Willingly
,
"
,
cried
Jocelyn
,
venturing
to
take
her
hand
,
and
gazing
at
her
tenderly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Most
willingly
.
<EOS>
""You
are
far
too
ready
to
promise
,
"
she
rejoined
with
a
sad
,
sweet
smile
.
<EOS>
"
What
I
desire
is
this
.
<EOS>
Recall
your
hasty
pledge
to
my
father
,
and
aid
me
in
dissuading
him
from
the
enterprise
in
which
he
would
engage
you
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
the
words
were
uttered
the
Puritan
stepped
from
behind
the
alley
which
had
enabled
him
to
approach
them
unperceived
,
and
overhear
their
brief
converse
.
<EOS>
"Hold
!
<EOS>
"
he
exclaimed
in
a
solemn
tone
,
and
regarding
Jocelyn
with
great
earnestness
.
"
<EOS>
That
promise
is
sacred
.
<EOS>
It
was
made
in
a
father
's
name
,
and
must
be
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
As
to
my
purpose
it
is
unchangeable
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
enthusiast
's
influence
over
Jocelyn
would
have
proved
irresistible
but
for
the
interposition
of
Aveline
.
<EOS>
"Be
not
controlled
by
him
,
"
she
said
in
a
low
tone
to
the
young
man
;
adding
to
her
father
,
"
For
my
sake
,
let
the
promise
be
cancelled
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
him
ask
it
,
and
it
shall
be
,
"
<EOS>
rejoined
the
Puritan
,
gazing
steadily
at
the
young
man
,
as
if
he
would
penetrate
his
soul
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hesitate
?
<EOS>
"
he
cried
in
accents
of
deep
disappointment
,
perceiving
Jocelyn
waver
.
<EOS>
"You
can
not
misunderstand
his
wishes
,
father
,
"
said
Aveline
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
him
speak
for
himself
,
"
Hugh
Calveley
exclaimed
angrily
.
"
<EOS>
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
!
"
<EOS>
he
continued
,
folding
his
arms
upon
his
breast
,
and
regarding
the
young
man
fixedly
as
before
,
"
son
of
my
old
friend
!
<EOS>
son
of
him
who
died
in
my
arms
!
<EOS>
son
of
him
whom
I
committed
to
the
earth
!
<EOS>
if
thou
hast
aught
of
thy
father
's
true
spirit
,
thou
wilt
rigidly
adhere
to
a
pledge
voluntarily
given
,
and
which
,
uttered
as
it
was
uttered
by
thee
,
has
all
the
sanctity
,
all
the
binding
force
of
a
vow
before
Heaven
,
where
it
is
registered
,
and
approved
by
him
who
is
gone
before
us
.
<EOS>
"Greatly
<EOS>
moved
by
this
appeal
,
Jocelyn
might
have
complied
with
it
,
but
Aveline
again
interposed
.
"Not
<EOS>
so
,
father
,
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
The
spirits
of
the
just
made
perfect
—
and
of
such
is
the
friend
you
mention
—
would
never
approve
of
the
design
with
which
you
would
link
this
young
man
,
in
consequence
of
a
promise
rashly
made
.
<EOS>
Discharge
him
from
it
,
I
entreat
you
.
<EOS>
"Her
<EOS>
energy
shook
even
the
Puritan
's
firmness
.
<EOS>
"Be
it
as
thou
wilt
,
daughter
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
,
after
the
pause
of
a
few
moments
,
during
which
he
waited
for
Jocelyn
to
speak
;
<EOS>
but
,
as
the
young
man
said
nothing
,
he
rightly
interpreted
his
silence,—"be
it
as
thou
wilt
,
since
he
,
too
,
wills
it
so
.
<EOS>
I
give
him
back
his
promise
.
<EOS>
But
let
me
see
him
no
more
.
<EOS>
""Sir
<EOS>
,
I
beseech
you
—
"
cried
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
cut
short
by
the
Puritan
,
who
,
turning
from
him
contemptuously
,
said
to
his
daughter—"Let
him
depart
immediately
.
<EOS>
"Aveline
<EOS>
signed
to
the
young
man
to
go
;
but
finding
him
remain
motionless
,
she
took
him
by
the
hand
,
and
led
him
some
way
along
the
terrace
.
<EOS>
Then
,
releasing
her
hold
,
she
bade
him
<EOS>
farewell!"Wherefore
<EOS>
have
you
done
this
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Jocelyn
reproachfully
.
<EOS>
"Question
<EOS>
me
not
;
but
be
satisfied
<EOS>
I
have
acted
for
the
best
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
O
Jocelyn
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
continued
anxiously
,
"
if
an
opportunity
should
occur
to
you
of
serving
my
father
,
do
not
neglect
it
.
<EOS>
""Be
assured
I
will
not
,
"
the
young
man
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
not
meet
again
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
in
a
tone
of
deepest
anxiety
.
"Perhaps
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
go
.
<EOS>
My
father
will
become
impatient
.
<EOS>
Again
farewell!"On
this
they
separated
:
the
young
man
sorrowfully
departing
,
while
her
footsteps
retreated
in
the
opposite
direction
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
May
games
went
forward
on
the
green
with
increased
spirit
and
merriment
,
and
without
the
slightest
hinderance
.
<EOS>
More
than
once
the
mummers
had
wheeled
their
mazy
rounds

Taverner

<EOS>
More
than
once
the
audacious
'
prentice
,
now
become
desperately
enamoured
of
his
pretty
partner
,
had
ventured
to
steal
a
kiss
from
her
lips
.
<EOS>
More
than
once
he
had
whispered
words
of
love
in
her
ear
;
though
,
as
yet
,
he
had
obtained
no
tender
response
.
<EOS>
Once
—
and
once
only
—
had
he
taken
her
hand
;
but
then
he
had
never
quitted
it
afterwards
.
<EOS>
In
vain
other
swains
claimed
her
for
a
dance
.
<EOS>
Dick
refused
to
surrender
his
prize
.
<EOS>
They
breakfasted
together
in
a
little
bower
made
of
green
boughs
,
the
most
delightful
and
lover
-
like
retreat
imaginable
.
<EOS>
Dick
's
appetite
,
furious
an
hour
ago
,
was
now
clean
gone
.
<EOS>
He
could
eat
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
subsisted
on
love
alone
.
<EOS>
But
as
she
was
prevailed
upon
to
sip
from
a
foaming
tankard
of
Whitsun
ale
,
he
quaffed
the
remainder
of
the
liquid
with
rapture
.
<EOS>
This
done

they
resumed
their
merry
sports
,
and
began
to
dance

again
.
<EOS>
The
bells
continued
to
ring
blithely
,
the
assemblage
to
shout
,
and
the
minstrels
to
play
.

A
strange
contrast
to
what

passing

CHAPTER
XIX.Theobalds
'
Palace
.
<EOS>
The
magnificent
palace
of
Theobalds
,
situated
near
Cheshunt
,
in
Hertfordshire
,
originally
the
residence
of
the
great
Lord
Treasurer
Burleigh
,
and
the
scene
of
his
frequent
and
sumptuous
entertainments
to
Queen
Elizabeth
and
the
ambassadors
to
her
Court
,
when
she
"
was
seen
,
"
says
Stow
,
"
in
as
great
royalty
,
and
served
as
bountifully
and
magnificently
as
at
any
other
time
or
place
,
all
at
his
lordship
's
charge
;
with
rich
shows
,
pleasant
devices
,
and
all
manner
of
sports
,
to
the
great
delight
of
her
Majesty
and
her
whole
train
,
with
great
thanks
from
all
who
partook
of
it
,
and
as
great
commendations
from
all
that
heard
of
it
abroad:"—this
famous
and
delightful
palace
,
with
its
stately
gardens
,
wherein
Elizabeth
had
so
often
walked
and
held
converse
with
her
faithful
counsellor
;
and
its
noble
parks
and
chases
,
well
stocked
with
deer
,
wherein
she
had
so
often
hunted
;
came
into
possession
of
James
the
First
,
in
the
manner
we
shall
proceed
to
relate
,
some
years
before
the
date
of
this
history
.
<EOS>
James
first
made
acquaintance
with
Theobalds
during
his
progress
from
Scotland
to
assume
the
English
crown
,
and
it
was
the
last
point
at
which
he
halted
before
entering
the
capital
of
his
new
dominions
.
<EOS>
Here
,
for
four
days
,
he
and
his
crowd
of
noble
attendants
were
guests
of
Sir
Robert
Cecil
,
afterwards
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
who
proved
himself
the
worthy
son
of
his
illustrious
and
hospitable
sire
by
entertaining
the
monarch
and
his
numerous
train
in
the
same
princely
style
that
the
Lord
Treasurer
had
ever
displayed
towards
Queen
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
An
eyewitness
has
described
the
King
's
arrival
at
Theobalds
on
this
occasion
.
"
<EOS>
Thus
,
then
,
"
says
John
Savile
,
"
for
his
Majesty
's
coming
up
the
walk
,
there
came
before
him
some
of
the
nobility
,
barons
,
knights
,
esquires
,
gentlemen
,
and
others
,
amongst
whom
was
the
sheriff
of
Essex
,
and
most
of
his
men
,
the
trumpets
sounding
next
before
his
highness
,
sometimes
one
,
sometimes
another
;
his
Majesty
riding
not
continually
betwixt
the
same
two
,
but
sometimes
one
,
sometimes
another
,
as
seemed
best
to
his
highness
;
the
whole
nobility
of
our
land
and
Scotland
round
about
him
observing
no
place
of
superiority
,
all
bare
-
headed
,
all
of
whom
alighted
from
their
horses
at
their
entrance
into
the
first
court
,
save
only
his
Majesty
alone
,
who
rid
along
still
,
four
noblemen
laying
their
hands
upon
his
steed
,
two
before
and
two
behind
.
<EOS>
In
this
manner
he
came
to
the
court
door
,
where
I
myself
stood
.
<EOS>
At
the
entrance
into
that
court
stood
many
noblemen
,
amongst
whom
was
Sir
Robert
Cecil
,
who
there
meeting
his
Majesty
conducted
him
into
his
house
,
all
which
was
practised
with
as
great
applause
of
the
people
as
could
be
,
hearty
prayer
,
and
throwing
up
of
hats
.
<EOS>
His
Majesty
had
not
stayed
above
an
hour
in
his
chamber
,
but
hearing
the
multitude
throng
so
fast
into
the
uppermost
court
to
see
his
highness
,
he
showed
himself
openly
out
of
his
chamber
window
by
the
space
of
half
an
hour
together
;
after
which
time
he
went
into
the
labyrinth
-
like
garden
to
walk
,
where
he
secreted
himself
in
the
Meander
's
compact
of
bays
,
rosemary
,
and
the
like
overshadowing
his
walk
,
to
defend
him
from
the
heat
of
the
sun
till
supper
time
,
at
which
was
such
plenty
of
provision
for
all
sorts
of
men
in
their
due
places
as
struck
me
with
admiration
.
<EOS>
And
first
,
to
begin
with
the
ragged
regiments
,
and
such
as
were
debarred
the
privilege
of
any
court
,
these
were
so
sufficiently
rewarded
with
beef
,
veal
,
mutton
,
bread
,
and
beer
,
that
they
sung
holiday
every
day
,
and
kept
a
continual
feast
.
<EOS>
As
for
poor
maimed
and
distressed
soldiers
,
which
repaired
thither
for
maintenance
,
the
wine
,
money
,
and
meat
which
they
had
in
very
bounteous
sort
,
hath
become
a
sufficient
spur
to
them
to
blaze
it
abroad
since
their
coming
to
London
.
<EOS>
"
The
reader
will
marvel
at
the
extraordinary
and
unstinting
hospitality
practised
in
those
days
,
which
,
as
we
have
shown
,
was
exhibited
to
all
comers
,
irrespective
of
rank
,
even
to
the
"
ragged
regiments
,
"
and
which
extended
its
bounties
in
the
shape
of
alms
to
the
wounded
and
disabled
veteran
.
<EOS>
We
find
no
parallel
to
it
in
modern
times
.
<EOS>
Theobalds
produced
a
highly
favourable
impression
upon
James
,
who
,
passionately
attached
to
the
chase
,
saw
in
its
well
-
stocked
parks
the
means
of
gratifying
his
tastes
to
the
fullest
extent
.
<EOS>
Its
contiguity
to
Enfield
Chase
was
also
a
great
recommendation
;
and
its
situation
,
beautiful
in
itself
,
was
retired
,
and
yet
within
easy
distance
of
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
It
appeared
to
him
to
combine
all
the
advantages
of
a
royal
hunting
-
seat
with
all
the
splendours
of
a
palace
;
and
his
predilections
were
confirmed
by
a
second
visit
paid
by
him
to
it
in
1606
,
when
he
was
accompanied
by
his
brother
-
in
-
law
,
Christianus
,
King
of
Denmark
,
and
when
the
two
monarchs
were
gloriously
entertained
by
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
The
Danish
king
drank
inordinately
;
so
did
the
whole
of
his
suite
:
and
they
soon
inoculated
the
English
Court
with
their
sottish
tastes
.
<EOS>
Bonnie
King
Jamie
himself
got
fou
twice
a
-
day
;
and
,
melancholy
to
relate
,
the
ladies
of
the
Court
followed
the
royal
example
,
and
,
"
abandoning
their
sobriety
,
were
seen
to
roll
about
in
intoxication
.
"
<EOS>
So
says
Sir
John
Harington
,
who
has
given
a
very
diverting
account
of
the
orgies
at
Theobalds
,
and
the
inebriate
extravagances
of
Christianus
.
<EOS>
"
One
day
,
"
writes
Sir
John
,
"
a
great
feast
was
held
;
and
after
dinner
the
representation
of
Solomon
's
Temple
and
the
coming
of
the
Queen
of
Sheba
was
made
,
or
(
as
I
may
better
say
)
was
meant
to
have
been
made
before
their
Majesties
,
by
device
of
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
and
others
.
<EOS>
But
alas
!
<EOS>
as
all
earthly
things
do
fail
to
poor
mortals
in
enjoyment
,
so
did
prove
our
presentment
thereof
.
<EOS>
The
lady
that
did
play
the
Queen
's
part
did
carry
most
precious
gifts
to
both
their
Majesties
,
but
forgetting
the
steps
arising
to
the
canopy
,
overset
her
casket
into
his
Danish
Majesty
's
lap
,
and
fell
at
his
feet
,
though
I
rather
think
it
was
into
his
face
.
<EOS>
Much
was
the
hurry
and
confusion
.
<EOS>
Cloths
and
napkins
were
at
hand
to
make
all
clean
.
<EOS>
His
Majesty
then
got
up
,
and
would
dance
with
the
Queen
of
Sheba
;
but
he
fell
down
and
humbled
himself
before
her
,
and
was
carried
to
an
inner
chamber
,
and
laid
on
a
bed
of
state
.
<EOS>
The
entertainment
and
show
went
forward
,
and
most
of
the
presenters
went
backward
,
or
fell
down
;
wine
did
so
occupy
their
upper
chambers
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Worthy
Sir
John
seems
to
have
been
greatly
scandalized
,
as
he
well
might
be
,
at
these
shameless
proceedings
,
and
he
exclaims
pathetically
,
"
The
Danes
have
again
conquered
the
Britons
;
for
I
see
no
man
,
or
woman
either
,
that
can
command
himself
or
herself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
does
he
fail
to
contrast
these
"
strange
pageantries
"
with
what
occurred
of
the
same
sort
,
in
the
same
place
,
in
Queen
Elizabeth
's
time
,
observing
,
"
I
never
did
see
such
lack
of
good
order
,
discretion
,
and
sobriety
as
I
have
now
done
.
<EOS>
"Having
<EOS>
set
his
heart
upon
Theobalds
,
James
offered
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
in
exchange
for
it
,
the
palace
and
domains
of
Hatfield
;
and
the
proposal
being
accepted
(
it
could
not
very
well
be
refused
)
,
the
delivery
of
the
much
-
coveted
place
was
made
on
the
22nd
May
,
1607
;
the
Prince
Joinville
,
brother
to
the
Duke
de
Guise
,
being
present
on
the
occasion
,
where
fresh
festivities
were
held
,
accompanied
by
an
indifferent
Masque
from
Ben
Jonson
.
<EOS>
Whether
the
King
or
the
Earl
had
the
best
of
the
bargain
,
we
are
not
prepared
to
decide
.
<EOS>
Enchanted
with
his
acquisition
,
James
commenced
the
work
of
improvement
and
embellishment
by
enlarging
the
park
,
appropriating
a
good
slice
of
Enfield
Chace
,
with
parts
of
Northaw
and
Cheshunt
Commons
,
and
surrounding
the
whole
with
a
high
brick
wall
ten
miles
in
circumference
.
<EOS>
Within
this
ring
he
found
ample
scope
for
the
indulgence
of
his
hunting
propensities
,
since
it
contained
an
almost
inexhaustible
stock
of
the
finest
deer
in
the
kingdom
;
and
within
it
might
be
heard
the
sound
of
his
merry
horn
,
and
the
baying
of
his
favourite
stag
-
hounds
,
whenever
he
could
escape
from
the
cares
of
state
,
or
the
toils
of
the
council
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
His
escapes
from
these
demands
upon
his
time
were
so
frequent
,
and
the
attraction
of
the
woods
of
Theobalds
so
irresistible
,
that
remonstrances
were
made
to
him
on
the
subject
;
but
they
proved
entirely
ineffectual
.
<EOS>
He
declared
he
would
rather
return
to
Scotland
than
forego
his
amusements
.
<EOS>
Theobalds
,
in
the
time
of
its
grandeur
,
might
be
styled
the
Fontainebleau
of
England
.
<EOS>
Though
not
to
be
compared
with
Windsor
Castle
in
grandeur
of
situation
,
or
magnificence
of
forest
scenery
,
still
it
was
a
stately
residence
,
and
worthy
of
the
monarch
of
a
mighty
country
.
<EOS>
Crowned
with
four
square
towers
of
considerable
height
and
magnitude
,
each
with
a
lion
and
vane
on
the
top
;
it
had
besides
,
a
large
,
lantern
-
shaped
central
turret
,
proudly
domineering
over
the
others
,
and
"
made
with
timber
of
excellent
workmanship
,
curiously
wrought
with
divers
pinnacles
at
each
corner
,
wherein
were
hung
twelve
bells
for
chimage
,
and
a
clock
with
chimes
of
sundry
work
.
<EOS>
"
The
whole
structure
was
built
,
says
the
survey
,
"
of
excellent
brick
,
with
coigns
,
jambs
,
and
cornices
of
stone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Approached
from
the
south
by
a
noble
avenue
of
trees
,
planted
in
double
rows
,
and
a
mile
in
length
,
it
presented
a
striking
and
most
picturesque
appearance
,
with
its
lofty
towers
,
its
great
gilded
vanes
,
supported
,
as
we
have
said
,
by
lions
,
its
crowd
of
twisted
chimnies
,
its
leaded
and
arched
walks
,
its
balconies
,
and
its
immense
bay
windows
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
it
lose
its
majestic
and
beautiful
aspect
as
you
advanced
nearer
,
and
its
vast
proportions
became
more
fully
developed
.
<EOS>
Then
you
perceived
its
grand
though
irregular
facades
,
its
enormous
gates
,
its
cloistered
walks
,
and
its
superb
gardens
;
and
comprehended
that
with
its
five
courts
and
the
countless
apartments
they
contained
,
to
say
nothing
of
the
world
of
offices
,
that
the
huge
edifice
comprised
a
town
within
itself
—
and
a
well
-
peopled
town
too
.
<EOS>
The
members
of
the
household
,
and
the
various
retainers
connected
with
it
,
were
multitudinous
as
the
rooms
themselves
.
<EOS>
One
charm
and
peculiarity
of
the
palace
,
visible
from
without
,
consisted
in
the
arched
walks
before
referred
to
,
placed
high
up
on
the
building
,
on
every
side
.
<EOS>
Screened
from
the
weather
,
these
walks
looked
upon
the
different
courts
and
gardens
,
and
commanded
extensive
views
of
the
lovely
sylvan
scenery
around
.
<EOS>
Hence
Cheshunt
and
Waltham
Abbey
,
Enfield
,
and
other
surrounding
villages
,
could
be
distinguished
through
the
green
vistas
of
the
park
.
<EOS>
On
the
south
,
facing
the
grand
avenue
,
was
"
a
large
open
cloister
,
built
upon
several
large
fair
pillars
of
stone
,
arched
over
with
seven
arches
,
with
a
fair
rail
,
and
balusters
,
well
painted
with
the
Kings
and
Queens
of
England
,
and
the
pedigree
of
the
old
Lord
Burleigh
,
and
divers
other
ancient
families
.
<EOS>
"The
body
of
the
palace
consisted
of
two
large
quadrangles
:
one
of
which
,
eighty
-
six
feet
square
,
was
denominated
the
Fountain
Court
,
from
the
circumstance
of
a
fountain
of
black
and
white
marble
standing
within
it
.
<EOS>
The
other
quadrangle
,
somewhat
larger
,
being
one
hundred
and
ten
feet
square
,
was
called
the
Middle
Court
.
<EOS>
In
addition
to
these
,
there
were
three
other
smaller
courts
,
respectively
entitled
the
Dial
Court
,
the
Buttery
Court
,
and
the
Dove
-
house
Court
,
wherein
the
offices
were
situated
.
<EOS>
On
the
east
side
of
the
Fountain
Court
stood
an
arched
cloister
;
and
on
the
ground
-
floor
there
was
a
spacious
hall
,
paved
with
marble
,
and
embellished
with
a
curiously
-
carved
ceiling
.
<EOS>
Adjoining
it
were
the
apartments
assigned
to
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
as
Keeper
of
Theobalds
,
the
council
-
chamber
,
and
the
chambers
of
Sir
Lewis
Lewkener
,
Master
of
the
Ceremonies
,
and
Sir
John
Finett
.

Above

-
colour
and
gilded
,
having
rich
pendents
from
the
ceiling
,
and
vast
windows
resplendent
with
armorial
bearings
.
<EOS>
Near
this
were
the
privy
-
chamber
and
the
King
's
bed
-
chamber
,
together
with
a
wide
gallery
,
one
hundred
and
twenty
-
three
feet
in
length
,
wainscotted
and
roofed
like
the
presence
-
chamber
,
but
yet
more
gorgeously
fretted
and
painted
.
<EOS>
Its
walls
were
ornamented
with
stags
'
heads
with
branching
antlers
.
<EOS>
On
the
upper
floor
were
the
rooms
assigned
to
the
Duke
of
Lennox
,
as
Lord
Chamberlain
,
and
close
to
them
was
one
of
the
external
leaded
walks
before
alluded
to
,
sixty
-
two
feet
long
-
and
eleven
wide
,
which
,
from
its
eminent
position
,
carried
the
gaze
to
Ware
.
<EOS>
In
the
Middle
-
court
were
the
Queen
's
apartments
,
comprising
her
chapel
,
presence
-
chamber
,
and
other
rooms
,
and
over
them
a
gallery
nearly
equal
in
length
to
that
reserved
for
the
King
.
<EOS>
In
this
quadrangle
,
also
,
were
Prince
Charles
's
lodgings
.
<EOS>
Over
the
latter
was
the
Green
Gallery
,
one
hundred
and
nine
feet
in
length
,
and
proportionately
wide
.
<EOS>
And
above
the
gallery
was
another
external
covered
walk
,
<EOS>
wherein
were
two
"
lofty
arches
of
brick
,
of
no
small
ornament
to
the
house
,
and
rendering
it
comely
and
pleasant
to
all
that
passed
by
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
gardens
were
enchanting
,
and
in
perfect
keeping
with
the
palace
.
<EOS>
Occupying
several
acres
.
<EOS>
They
seemed
infinitely
larger
than
they
were
,
since
they
abounded
in
intricate
alleys
,
labyrinths
,
and
mazes
;
so
that
you
were
easily
lost
within
them
,
and
sometimes
wanted
a
clue
to
come
forth
.
<EOS>
They
contained
some
fine
canals
,
fountains
,
and
statues
.
<EOS>
In
addition
to
the
great
gardens
were
the
priory
-
gardens
,
with
other
inclosures
for
pheasants
,
aviaries
,
and
menageries
;
for
James
was
very
fond
of
wild
beasts
,
and
had
a
collection
of
them
worthy
of
a
zoological
garden
.
<EOS>
In
one
of
his
letters
to
Buckingham
when
the
latter
was
at
Madrid
,
we
find
him
inquiring
about
the
elephant
,
camels
,
and
wild
asses
.
<EOS>
He
had
always
a
camel
-
house
at
Theobalds
.
<EOS>
To
close
our
description
,
we
may
add
that
the
tennis
-
court
,
manége
stable
kennels
,
and
falconry
were
on
a
scale
of
magnitude
proportionate
to
the
palace
.
<EOS>
Beneath
the
wide
-
spreading
branches
of
a
noble
elm
,
forming
part
of
the
great
avenue
,
and
standing
at
a
short
distance
from
the
principal
,
entrance
to
the
palace
,
were
collected
together
,
one
pleasant
afternoon
in
May
,
a
small
group
of
persons
,
consisting
almost
entirely
of
the
reader
's
acquaintances
.
<EOS>
Chief
amongst
them
was
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
,
who
,
having
dismounted
and
fastened
his
horse
to
the
branch
,
was
leaning
against
the
large
trunk
of
the
tree
,
contemplating
the
magnificent
structure
we
have
attempted
to
describe
.
<EOS>
Unacquainted
as
yet
with
its
internal
splendours
,
he
had
no
difficulty
in
comprehending
them
from
what
he
beheld
from
without
.
<EOS>
The
entrance
gates
were
open
,
and
a
wide
archway
beyond
leading
to
the
great
quadrangle
,
gave
him
a
view
of
its
beautiful
marble
fountain
in
the
midst
,
ornamented
with
exquisite
statues
of
Venus
and
Cupid
.
<EOS>
Numerous
officers
of
the
household
,
pages
,
ushers
,
and
serving
-
men
in
the
royal
liveries
,
with
now
<EOS>
and
then
some
personage
of
distinction
,
were
continually
passing
across
the
Fountain
Court
.
<EOS>
Gaily
attired
courtiers
,
in
doublets
of
satin
and
mantles
of
velvet
,
were
lounging
in
the
balconies
of
the
presence
-
chamber
,
staring
at
Jocelyn
and
his
companions
for
,
want
of
better
occupation
.
<EOS>
Other
young
nobles
,
accompanied
by
richly
-
habited
dames
—
some
of
them
the
highest
-
born
and
loveliest
in
the
land
—
were
promenading
to
and
fro
upon
the
garden
terrace
on
the
right
,
chattering
and
laughing
loudly
.
<EOS>
There
was
plenty
of
life
and
movement
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Even
in
the
Lord
Chamberlain
's
walk
,
which
,
as
we
have
said
,
was
contrived
in
the
upper
part
of
the
structure
,
and
formed
a
sort
of
external
gallery
,
three
persons
might
be
discerned
;
and
to
save
the
reader
any
speculation
,
we
will
tell
him
that
these
persons
were
the
Duke
of
Lennox
(
Lord
Chamberlain
)
,
the
Conde
de
Gondomar
(
the
Spanish
lieger
-
ambassador
)
,
and
the
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
In
front
of
the
great
gates
were
stationed
four
warders
with
the
royal
badge
woven
in
gold
on
the
front
and
back
of
their
crimson
doublets
,
with
roses
in
their
velvet
hats
,
roses
in
their
buskins
,
and
halberts
over
their
shoulders
.
<EOS>
Just
within
the
gates
stood
a
gigantic
porter
,
a
full
head
and
shoulders
taller
than
the
burly
warders
themselves
.
<EOS>
From
the
summit
of
the
lofty
central
tower
of
the
palace
floated
the
royal
banner
,
discernible
by
all
the
country
round
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
side
of
the
tree
against
which
Jocelyn
was
leaning
,
and
looking
down
the
long
avenue
,
rather
than
towards
the
palace
,
stood
Dick
Taverner
,
who
however
bestowed
little
attention
upon
his
master
,
being
fully
occupied
by
a
more
attractive
object
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Dickon
,
it
appeared
,
had
succeeded
in
inducing
Gillian
Greenford
to
accompany
him
in
the
expedition
to
Theobalds
,
and
as
the
fair
damsel
could
not
of
course
go
alone
,
she
had
cajoled
her
good
-
natured
old
grandsire
into
conveying
her
thither
;
and
she
was
now
seated
behind
him
upon
a
pillion
placed
on
the
back
of
a
strong
,
rough
-
coated
,
horse
.
<EOS>
Dick
was
in
raptures
at
his
success
.
<EOS>
The
ride
from
Tottenham
had
been
delightful
.
<EOS>
They
had
tarried
for
a
short
time
to
drink
a
cup
of
ale
at
the
Bell
at
Edmonton
,
where
Dick
meant
to
have
breakfasted
,
though
chance
had
so
agreeably
prevented
him
,
and
where
the
liquor
was
highly
approved
by
the
old
farmer
,
who
became
thenceforth
exceedingly
chatty
,
and
talked
of
nothing
else
but
good
Queen
Bess
and
her
frequent
visits
to
Theobalds
in
the
old
Lord
Burleigh
's
time
,
during
the
rest
of
the
journey
.
<EOS>
Little
heed
was
paid
to
his
garrulity
by
the
young
couple
.
<EOS>
They
let
him
talk
on
,
feigning
to
listen
,
but
in
reality
noting
scarce
a
word
he
said
.
<EOS>
As
they
entered
the
park
of
Theobalds
,
however
,
they
found
their
tongues
,
and
Gillian
became
loud
in
her
admiration
of
the
beautiful
glades
that
opened
before
them
,
and
of
the
dappled
denizens
of
the
wood
that
tripped
lightsomely
across
the
sward
,
or
hurried
towards
the
thickets
.
<EOS>
The
park
,
indeed
,
looked
beautiful
with
its
fine
oaks
in
their
freshly
-
opened
foliage
of
the
tenderest
green
,
its
numerous
spreading
beeches
,
its
scattered
thorns
white
with
blossom
,
and
the
young
fern
just
springing
from
the
seed
in
the
brakes
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
Gillian
was
delighted
.
<EOS>
Dick
was
equally
enchanted
,
and
regretted
he
was
not
like
King
James
,
master
of
a
great
park
,
that
he
might
hunt
within
it
at
his
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
if
he
had
been
king
,
Gillian
would
naturally
have
been
his
queen
,
and
have
hunted
with
him
.
<EOS>
Old
Greenford
,
too
,
admired
the
scene
,
and
could
not
but
admit
that
the
park
was
improved
,
though
he
uttered
something
like
a
groan
as
he
thought
that
Queen
Elizabeth
and
the
Lord
Treasurer
could
be
seen
in
it
no
longer
.
<EOS>
After
riding
for
a
couple
of
miles
along
a
road
which
led
them
over
beautifully
undulating
ground
,
affording
glimpses
of
every
variety
of
forest
scenery
—
sometimes
plunging
them
into
the
depths
of
groves
,
where
the
path
was
covered
by
over
-
arching
trees
—
sometimes
crossing
the
open
chace
,
studded
by
single
aged
oaks
of
the
largest
size
—
sometimes
,
skirting
the
margin
of
a
pool
,
fringed
with
flags
,
reeds
,
and
bulrushes
for
the
protection
of
the
water
-
fowl
—
now
passing
the
large
heronry
,
to
the
strict
preservation
of
which
James
attached
the
utmost
importance
;
they
at
length
approached
the
long
avenue
leading
to
the
palace
.
<EOS>
At
its
entrance
they
found
Jocelyn
waiting
for
them
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
,
who
cared
not
for
their
company
,
had
ridden
on
in
advance
.
<EOS>
The
strange
events
of
the
morning
gave
him
plenty
of
material
for
reflection
,
and
he
longed
to
commune
with
himself
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
when
the
others
stopped
at
Edmonton
,
he
quitted
them
,
promising
to
halt
till
they
came
up
,
before
entering
the
precincts
of
the
palace
.
<EOS>
If
his
ride
was
not
so
agreeable
as
their
's
,
it
at
least
enabled
him
to
regain
,
in
some
degree
,
his
composure
of
mind
,
which
had
been
greatly
disturbed
by
his
abrupt
parting
with
Aveline
.
<EOS>
Her
image
was
constantly
before
him
,
and
refusing
to
be
dismissed
,
connected
itself
with
every
object
he
beheld
.
<EOS>
At
first
he
despaired
of
meeting
her
again
;
but
as
he
gradually
grew
calmer
,
his
hopes
revived
,
and
difficulties
which
seemed
insuperable
began
to
disperse
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
Dick
Taverner
and
his
companions
came
up
,
he
felt
some
disposition
to
talk
,
and
Gillian
's
hearty
merriment
and
high
spirits
helped
to
enliven
him
.
<EOS>
Having
ascertained
,
from
one
of
the
royal
keepers
whom
he
had
encountered
,
that
the
King
,
with
a
large
company
,
was
out
hawking
on
the
banks
of
the
New
River
,
which
was
cut
through
the
park
,
and
that
he
would
in
all
probability
return
through
the
great
avenue
to
the
palace
,
he
proposed
that
they
should
station
themselves
somewhere
within
it
,
in
order
to
see
him
pass
.
<EOS>
This
arrangement
pleased
all
parties
,
so
proceeding
slowly
up
the
avenue
,
they
took
up
a
position
as
described
.
<EOS>
More
than
an
hour
,
however
,
elapsed
,
and
still
James
,
who
no
doubt
was
pleased
with
his
sport
,
came
not
.
<EOS>
Without
being
aware
of
their
high
quality
,
or
having
the
slightest
notion
that
the
Conde
Gondomar
was
one
of
them
,
Jocelyn
had
remarked
the
three
personages
in
the
Lord
Chamberlain
's
Walk
.
<EOS>
He
had
seen
them
pause
,
and
apparently
look
towards
the
little
group
of
which
he
himself
formed
part
.
<EOS>
Shortly
after
this
,
two
of
the
party
retired
,
leaving
the
third
alone
in
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
these
two
individuals
were
seen
to
cross
the
Fountain
Court
,
and
passing
through
the
great
gates
,
to
direct
their
steps
towards
the
avenue
.
<EOS>
As
they
approached
,
Jocelyn
recognised
one
of
them
as
Lord
Roos
,
whom
he
had
seen
play
so
singular
a
part
at
Madame
Bonaventure
's
ordinary
.
<EOS>
The
other
was
wholly
unknown
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
that
he
was
a
person
of
the
utmost
distinction
he
felt
convinced
,
as
well
from
his
haughty
bearing
and
sumptuous
attire
,
as
from
the
evident
respect
paid
him
by
his
companion
.
<EOS>
In
stature
he
was
rather
short
,
being
somewhat
under
the
ordinary
standard
;
but
his
figure
was
admirably
proportioned
,
and
was
displayed
to
the
greatest
advantage
by
his
rich
habiliments
.
<EOS>
His
doublet
was
of
sea
-
green
satin
,
embroidered
with
silver
and
black
,
with
rich
open
sleeves
,
and
his
Spanish
cloak
was
of
velvet
of
the
same
colour
and
similarly
embroidered
.
<EOS>
His
hose
were
of
tawny
silk
,
and
the
plumes
in
his
bonnet
black
,
striped
with
white
.
<EOS>
He
was
decorated
with
the
order
of
the
Golden
Fleece
,
and
bore
at
his
side
a
genuine
blade
of
Toledo
,
with
a
handle
of
rarest
workmanship
.
<EOS>
Bound
his
throat
he
wore
a
large
,
triple
ruff
,
edged
with
pointed
lace
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
oval
in
shape
,
his
complexion
of
a
rich
olive
hue
,
his
eyes
large
,
dark
,
and
keen
,
his
features
singularly
handsome
,
and
his
looks
penetrating
.
<EOS>
His
hair
was
raven
-
black
,
cut
short
,
and
removed
from
the
forehead
.
<EOS>
Lord
Roos
and
his
companion
passed
close
to
Jocelyn
without
appearing
to
notice
him
;
but
they
halted
before
Gillian
,
regarding
her
with
insolent
admiration
.
<EOS>
Evidently
she
was
the
object
that
had
brought
them
forth
.
<EOS>
The
poor
damsel
was
terribly
confused
by
their
ardent
glances
and
libertine
scrutiny
,
and
blushed
to
her
very
temples
.
<EOS>
As
to
Dick
Taverner
,
he
trembled
with
rage
and
jealousy
,
and
began
to
repent
having
brought
his
treasure
into
such
a
dangerous
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
The
person
who
seemed
to
be
most
struck
with
Gillian
's
charms
was
the
wearer
of
the
Spanish
mantle
.
<EOS>
"En
verdad
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
"
that
is
the
loveliest
piece
of
rusticity
I
have
seen
since
I
came
to
England
.
<EOS>
I
thought
mine
eyes
did
not
deceive
me
,
as
to
her
beauty
,
when
I
caught
sight
of
her
from
the
Lord
Chamberlain
's
gallery
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
Conde
de
Gondomar
hath
ever
an
eagle
's
eye
for
a
pretty
woman
,
"
Lord
Roos
replied
,
laughing
.
"The
<EOS>
Conde
de
Gondomar
!
"
<EOS>
mentally
ejaculated
Jocelyn
,
who
had
overheard
what
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
this
is
he
to
whom
the
ring
must
be
shown
.
<EOS>
The
opportunity
must
not
be
lost
.
<EOS>
"Accordingly
<EOS>
,
regardless
of
the
impropriety
of
the
proceeding
,
he
uncovered
his
head
,
and
advancing
towards
the
Spaniard
<EOS>
said—"I
believe
I
have
the
honour
of
addressing
the
Conde
de
Gondomar?""What
<EOS>
means
this
intrusion
,
Sir
?
"
<EOS>
Lord
Roos
demanded
insolently
.
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
to
say
to
his
Excellency?""I
bring
him
a
token
,
my
lord
,
"
the
young
man
replied
,
exhibiting
the
ring
,
given
him
by
the
masked
horseman
,
to
the
ambassador
.
"Ha
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
De
Gondomar
,
glancing
at
the
ring
,
and
then
regarding
Jocelyn
steadfastly
,
"
I
must
speak
with
this
young
man
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
abandon
the
damsel
?
"
demanded
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
—
no
—
you
must
take
care
of
her
,
"
De
Gondomar
replied
in
a
low
tone
.
"
<EOS>
Can
you
not
induce
Lady
Exeter
to
take
her
into
her
service?""I
will
try
,
"
Lord
Roos
replied
.
"
<EOS>
And
see
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
pointing
down
the
avenue
,
"
the
royal
party
is
returning
,
<EOS>
so
I
can
at
once
ascertain
whether
her
ladyship
will
second
your
Excellency
's
designs
.
<EOS>
""Do
<EOS>
so
,
"
said
De
Gondomar
,
"
and
I
shall
be
for
ever
indebted
to
you
.
<EOS>
This
girl
has
quite
taken
my
fancy
,
and
I
must
not
lose
her
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
Sir
,
"
he
added
,
stepping
aside
with
Jocelyn
,
"
you
have
brought
me
the
token
from
my
assured
agent
,
and
I
understand
from
it
that
you
are
a
person
upon
whom
I
may
rely
.
<EOS>
""In
all
that
beseems
a
gentleman
and
a
man
of
honour
and
loyalty
your
Excellency
may
rely
on
me
,
"
Jocelyn
replied
.
<EOS>
"I
shall
require
nothing
inconsistent
with
those
principles
,
"
the
Spanish
Ambassador
said
.
<EOS>
"
This
point
disposed
of
,
let
me
know
how
I
can
serve
you
,
<EOS>
for
I
presume
you
have
some
request
to
prefer?""Your
Excellency
can
very
materially
serve
me
,
"
Jocelyn
returned
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
in
danger
.
<EOS>
""I
thought
as
much
,
"
De
Gondomar
observed
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
Since
you
have
placed
yourself
under
my
protection
,
I
will
do
my
best
to
hold
you
harmless
.
<EOS>
But
who
is
your
enemy?""I
have
two
deadly
enemies
,
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
and
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
,
"
Jocelyn
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"I
know
them
well
—
instruments
of
Buckingham
,
"
said
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
indeed
dangerous
enemies
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
have
another
yet
more
dangerous
,
"
returned
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
reason
to
fear
that
,
by
boldness
of
speech
I
have
incurred
the
enmity
of
the
Marquis
of
Buckingham
himself
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
this
,
indeed
,
is
serious
,
"
said
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
"I
am
threatened
with
arrest
by
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
"
pursued
Jocelyn
;
"
so
your
Excellency
will
perceive
that
my
position
is
fraught
with
extreme
peril
.
<EOS>
Still
I
persuade
myself
,
if
I
could
obtain
a
hearing
of
the
King
,
I
should
be
able
to
set
my
enemies
at
defiance
and
obtain
my
right
.
<EOS>
"De
<EOS>
Gondomar
smiled
somewhat
scornfully
.
<EOS>
"You
will
obtain
little
in
that
way
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
your
enemies
will
crush
you
effectually
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
explain
to
me
precisely
how
you
are
circumstanced
,
and
I
will
then
consider
what
can
be
done
for
you
.
<EOS>
And
begin
by
acquainting
me
with
your
name
and
condition
,
for
as
yet
I
am
entirely
ignorant
whom
I
am
addressing
.
<EOS>
"Upon
<EOS>
this
Jocelyn
succinctly
related
to
the
Ambassador
all
such
particulars
of
his
history
as
have
been
laid
before
the
reader
.
<EOS>
De
Gondomar
listened
to
him
with
attention
,
and
put
some
questions
to
him
as
he
proceeded
.
<EOS>
At
its
close
his
countenance
brightened
.
<EOS>
"You
are
in
an
awkward
dilemma
,
it
must
be
owned
,
Master
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
think
I
can
protect
you
in
spite
of
them
all
—
in
spite
of
Buckingham
himself
.
<EOS>
Luckily
,
he
is
not
at
Theobalds
at
present
—
so
the
coast
is
clear
for
action
.
<EOS>
The
first
blow
is
half
the
battle
.
<EOS>
I
must
present
you
to
the
King
without
delay
.
<EOS>
And
see
,
his
Majesty
approaches
.
<EOS>
Stand
close
behind
me
,
and
act
as
I
advise
you
by
a
sign

"CHAPTER
<EOS>
XX.King
<EOS>
James
the
First
.
<EOS>
Meantime
the
royal
cavalcade
came
slowly
up
the
avenue
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
numerous
,
and
all
the
more
brilliant
in
appearance
,
since
it
comprised
nearly
as
many
high
-
born
dames
as
nobles
.
<EOS>
Amongst
the
distinguished
foreigners
who
with
their
attendants
swelled
the
party
were
the
Venetian
lieger
-
ambassador
Giustiniano
,
and
the
Marquis
de
Tremouille
,
of
the
family
des
Ursins
,
ambassador
from
France
.
<EOS>
These
exalted
personages
rode
close
behind
the
King
,
and
one
or
the
other
of
them
was
constantly
engaged
in
conversation
with
him
.
<EOS>
Giustiniano
had
one
of
those
dark
,
grave
,
handsome
countenances
familiarized
to
us
by
the
portraits
of
Titian
and
Tintoretto
,
and
even
the
King
's
jests
failed
in
making
him
smile
.
<EOS>
He
was
apparelled
entirely
in
black
velvet
,
with
a
cloak
bordered
with
the
costly
fur
of
the
black
fox
.
<EOS>
All
his
followers
were
similarly
attired
.
<EOS>
The
sombre
Venetian
presented
a
striking
contrast
to
his
vivacious
companion
,
the
gay
and
graceful
De
Tremouille
,
who
glittered
in
white
satin
,
embroidered
with
leaves
of
silver
,
while
the
same
colour
and
the
same
ornaments
were
adopted
by
his
retinue
.
<EOS>
No
order
of
precedence
was
observed
by
the
court
nobles
.
<EOS>
Each
rode
as
he
listed
.
<EOS>
Prince
Charles
was
absent
,
and
so
was
the
supreme
favourite
Buckingham
;
but
their
places
were
supplied
by
some
of
the
chief
personages
of
the
realm
,
including
the
Earls
of
Arundel
,
Pembroke
,
and
Montgomery
,
the
Marquis
of
Hamilton
,
and
the
Lords
Haddington
,
Fenton
,
and
Doncaster
.
<EOS>
Intermingled
with
the
nobles
,
the
courtiers
of
lesser
rank
,
and
the
ambassadors
'
followers
,
were
the
ladies
,
most
of
whom
claimed
attention
from
personal
charms
,
rich
attire
,
and
the
grace
and
skill
with
which
they
managed
their
horses
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
most
beautiful
amongst
them
was
the
young
Countess
of
Exeter
,
whose
magnificent
black
eyes
did
great
execution
.
<EOS>
The
lovely
Countess
was
mounted
on
a
fiery
Spanish
barb
,
given
to
her
by
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
Forced
into
a
union
with
a
gouty
and
decrepit
old
husband
,
<EOS>
the
Countess
of
Exeter
might
have
pleaded
this
circumstance
in
extenuation
of
some
of
her
follies
.
<EOS>
It
was
undoubtedly
an
argument
employed
by
her
admirers
,
who
,
in
endeavouring
to
shake
her
fidelity
to
her
lord
,
told
her
it
was
an
infamy
that
she
should
be
sacrificed
to
such
an
old
dotard
as
he
.
<EOS>
Whether
these
arguments
prevailed
in
more
cases
than
one
we
shall
not
inquire
too
nicely
;
but
,
if
court
-
scandal
may
be
relied
on
,
they
did
—
<EOS>
Buckingham
and
De
Gondomar
being
both
reputed
to
have
been
her
lovers
.
<EOS>
The
last
,
however
,
in
the
list
,
and
the
one
who
appeared
to
be
most
passionately
enamoured
of
the
beautiful
Countess
,
and
to
receive
the
largest
share
of
her
regard
,
was
Lord
Roos
;
and
as
this
culpable
attachment
and
its
consequences
connect
themselves
intimately
with
our
history
we
have
been
obliged
to
advert
to
them
thus
particularly
.
<EOS>
Lord
Roos
was
a
near
relative
of
the
Earl
of
Exeter
;
and
although
the
infirm
and
gouty
old
peer
had
been
excessively
jealous
of
his
lovely
young
wife
on
former
occasions
,
when
she
had
appeared
to
trifle
with
his
honour
,
he
seemed
perfectly
easy
and
unsuspicious
now
,
though
there
was
infinitely
more
cause
for
distrust
.
<EOS>
Possibly
he
had
too
much
reliance
on
Lord
Roos
's
good
feelings
and
principles
to
suspect
him
.
<EOS>
Very
different
was
Lady
Roos
's
conduct
.
<EOS>
This
unhappy
lady
,
whom
we
have
already
mentioned
as
the
daughter
of
Sir
Thomas
Lake
,
Secretary
of
State
,
had
the
misfortune
to
be
sincerely
attached
to
her
handsome
but
profligate
husband
,
whose
neglect
and
frequent
irregularities
she
had
pardoned
,
until
the
utter
estrangement
,
occasioned
by
his
passion
for
the
Countess
of
Exeter
,
filled
her
with
such
trouble
,
that
,
overpowered
at
length
by
anguish
,
she
complained
to
her
mother
Lady
<EOS>
Lake,—an
ambitious
and
imperious
woman
,
whose
vanity
had
prompted
her
to
bring
about
this
unfortunate
match
.
<EOS>
Expressing
the
greatest
indignation
at
the
treatment
her
daughter
had
experienced
,
Lady
Lake
counselled
her
to
resent
it
,
undertaking
herself
to
open
the
eyes
of
the
injured
Earl
of
Exeter
to
his
wife
's
infidelity
;
but
she
was
dissuaded
from
her
purpose
by
Sir
Thomas
Lake
.
<EOS>
Though
generally
governed
by
his
wife
,
Sir
Thomas
succeeded
,
in
this
instance
,
in
over
-
ruling
her
design
of
proceeding
at
once
to
extremities
with
the
guilty
pair
,
recommending
that
,
in
the
first
instance
,
Lord
Roos
should
be
strongly
remonstrated
with
by
Lady
Lake
and
her
daughter
,
when
perhaps
his
fears
might
be
aroused
,
if
his
sense
of
duty
could
not
be
awakened
.
<EOS>
This
final
appeal
had
not
yet
been
made
;
but
an
interview
had
taken
place
between
Lady
Roos
and
her
husband
,
at
which
,
with
many
passionate
entreaties
,
she
had
implored
him
to
shake
off
the
thraldom
in
which
he
had
bound
himself
,
and
to
return
to
her
,
when
all
should
be
forgiven
and
forgotten,—but
without
effect
.
<EOS>
Thus
matters
stood
at
present
.
<EOS>
As
we
have
seen
,
though
the
Countess
of
Exeter
formed
one
of
the
chief
ornaments
of
the
hawking
party
<EOS>
,
Lord
Roos
had
not
joined
it
;
his
absence
being
occasioned
by
a
summons
from
the
Conde
de
Gondomar
,
with
some
of
whose
political
intrigues
<EOS>
he
was
secretly
mixed
up
.
<EOS>
Whether
the
Countess
missed
him
or
not
,
we
pretend
not
to
say
.
<EOS>
All
we
are
able
to
declare
is
,
she
was
in
high
spirits
,
and
seemed
in
no
mood
to
check
the
advances
of
other
aspirants
to
her
favour
.
<EOS>
Her
beautiful
and
expressive
features
beamed
with
constant
smiles
,
and
her
lustrous
black
eyes
seemed
to
create
a
flame
wherever
their
beams
alighted
.
<EOS>
But
we
must
quit
this
enchantress
and
her
spells
,
and
proceed
with
the
description
of
the
royal
party
.
<EOS>
In
the
rear
of
those
on
horseback
walked
the
falconers
,
in
liveries
of
green
cloth
,
with
bugles
hanging
from
the
shoulder
;
each
man
having
a
hawk
upon
his
fist
,
completely
'
tired
in
its
hood
,
bells
,
varvels
,
and
jesses
.
<EOS>
At
the
heels
of
the
falconers
,
and
accompanied
by
a
throng
of
varlets
,
in
russet
jerkins
,
carrying
staves
,
came
two
packs
of
hounds,—one
used
for
what
was
termed
,
in
the
language
of
falconry
,
the
Flight
at
the
River,—these
were
all
water
-
spaniels
;
and
the
other
,
for
the
Flight
at
the
Field
.
<EOS>
Nice
music
they
made
,
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
varlets
in
russet
to
keep
them
quiet
.
<EOS>
Hawking
,
in
those
days
,
was
what
shooting
is
in
the
present
;
fowling
-
pieces
being
scarcely
used
,
if
at
all
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
varieties
of
the
hawk
-
tribe
were
not
merely
employed
in
the
capture
of
pheasants
,
partridges
,
grouse
,
rails
,
quails
,
and
other
game
,
besides
water
-
fowl
,
but
in
the
chase
of
hares
;
and
in
all
of
these
pursuits
the
falconers
were
assisted
by
dogs
.
<EOS>
Game
,
of
course
,
could
only
be
killed
at
particular
seasons
of
the
year
;
and
wild
-
geese
,
wild
-
ducks
,
woodcocks
,
and
snipes
in
the
winter
;
but
spring
and
summer
pastime
was
afforded
by
the
crane
,
the
bustard
,
the
heron
,
the
rook
,
and
the
kite
;
while
,
at
the
same
periods
,
some
of
the
smaller
description
of
water
-
fowl
offered
excellent
sport
on
lake
or
river
.
<EOS>
A
striking
and
picturesque
sight
that
cavalcade
presented
,
with
its
nodding
plumes
of
many
colours
,
its
glittering
silks
and
velvets
,
its
proud
array
of
horsemen
,
and
its
still
prouder
array
of
lovely
women
,
whose
personal
graces
and
charms
baffle
description
,
while
they
invite
it
.
<EOS>
Pleasant
were
the
sounds
that
accompanied
the
progress
of
the
train
:
the
jocund
laugh
,
the
musical
voices
of
women
,
the
jingling
of
bridles
,
the
snorting
and
trampling
of
steeds
,
the
baying
of
hounds
,
the
shouts
of
the
varlets
,
and
the
winding
of
horns
.
<EOS>
But
having
,
as
yet
,
omitted
the
principal
figure
,
we
must
hasten
to
describe
him
by
whom
the
party
was
headed
.
<EOS>
The
King
,
then
,
was
mounted
on
a
superb
milk
-
white
steed
,
with
wide
-
flowing
mane
and
tail
,
and
of
the
easiest
and
gentlest
pace
.
<EOS>
Its
colour
was
set
off
by
its
red
chanfrein
,
its
nodding
crest
of
red
feathers
,
its
broad
poitrinal
with
red
tassels
,
and
its
saddle
with
red
housings
.
<EOS>
Though
devoted
to
the
chase
,
as
we
have
shown
,
James
was
but
an
indifferent
horseman
;
and
his
safety
in
the
saddle
was
assured
by
such
high
-
bolstered
bows
in
front
and
at
the
back
,
that
it
seemed
next
to
impossible
he
could
be
shaken
out
of
them
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
in
spite
of
all
these
precautions
,
accidents
had
befallen
him
.
<EOS>
On
one
occasion
,
Sir
Symonds
D'Ewes
relates
that
he
was
thrown
headlong
into
a
pond
;
and
on
another
,
we
learn
from
a
different
source
that
he
was
cast
over
his
horse
's
head
into
the
New
River
,
and
narrowly
escaped
drowning
,
his
boots
alone
being
visible
above
the
ice
covering
the
stream
.
<EOS>
Moreover
the
monarch
's
attire
was
excessively
stiff
and
cumbrous
,
and
this
,
while
it
added
to
the
natural
ungainliness
of
his
person
,
prevented
all
freedom
of
movement
,
especially
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
His
doublet
,
which
on
the
present
occasion
was
of
green
velvet
,
considerably
frayed,—for
<EOS>
he
was
by
no
means
particular
about
the
newness
of
his
apparel,—was
padded
and
quilted
so
as
to
be
dagger
-
proof
;
and
his
hose
were
stuffed
in
the
same
manner
,
and
preposterously
large
about
the
hips
.
<EOS>
Then
his
ruff
was
triple
-
banded
,
and
so
stiffly
starched
,
that
the
head
was
fixed
immovably
amidst
its
plaits
.
<EOS>
Though
not
handsome
,
James
's
features
were
thoughtful
and
intelligent
,
with
a
gleam
of
cunning
in
the
eye
,
and
an
expression
of
sarcasm
about
the
mouth
,
and
they
contained
the
type
of
the
peculiar
physiognomy
that
distinguished
all
his
unfortunate
line
.
<EOS>
His
beard
was
of
a
yellowish
brown
,
and
scantily
covered
his
chin
,
and
his
thin
moustaches
were
of
a
yet
lighter
hue
.
<EOS>
His
hair
was
beginning
to
turn
gray
,
but
his
complexion
was
ruddy
and
hale
,
proving
that
,
but
for
his
constant
ebriety
and
indulgence
in
the
pleasures
of
the
table
,
he
might
have
attained
a
good
old
age
—
if
,
indeed
,
his
life
was
not
unfairly
abridged
.
<EOS>
His
large
eyes
were
for
ever
rolling
about
,
and
his
tongue
was
too
big
for
his
mouth
,
causing
him
to
splutter
in
utterance
,
besides
giving
him
a
disagreeable
appearance
when
eating
;
while
his
legs
were
so
weak
,
that
he
required
support
in
walking
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
these
defects
,
and
his
general
coarseness
of
manner
,
James
was
not
without
dignity
,
and
could
,
when
he
chose
,
assume
a
right
royal
air
and
deportment
.
<EOS>
But
these
occasions
were
rare
.
<EOS>
As
is
well
known
,
his
pedantry
and
his
pretensions
to
superior
wisdom
and
discrimination
,
procured
him
the
title
of
the
"
Scottish
Solomon
.
"
<EOS>
His
general
character
will
be
more
fully
developed
as
we
proceed
;
and
we
shall
show
the
perfidy
and
dissimulation
which
he
practised
in
carrying
out
his
schemes
,
and
tried
to
soften
down
under
the
plausible
appellation
of
"
King
-
craft
.
<EOS>
"James
was
never
seen
to
greater
advantage
than
on
occasions
like
the
present
.
<EOS>
His
hearty
enjoyment
of
the
sport
he
was
engaged
in
;
his
familiarity
with
all
around
him
,
even
with
the
meanest
varlets
by
whom
he
was
attended
,
and
for
whom
he
had
generally
some
droll
nickname
;
his
complete
abandonment
of
all
the
etiquette
which
either
he
or
his
master
of
the
ceremonies
observed
elsewhere
;
his
good
-
tempered
vanity
and
boasting
about
his
skill
as
a
woodsman,—all
<EOS>
these
things
created
an
impression
in
his
favour
,
which
was
not
diminished
in
those
who
were
not
brought
much
into
contact
with
him
in
other
ways
.
<EOS>
When
hunting
or
hawking
,
James
was
nothing
more
than
a
hearty
country
gentleman
engaged
in
the
like
sports
.
<EOS>
The
cavalcade
came
leisurely
on
,
for
the
King
proceeded
no
faster
than
would
allow
the
falconers
to
keep
easily
up
with
those
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
high
good
humour
,
and
laughed
and
jested
sometimes
with
one
ambassador
,
sometimes
with
the
other
,
and
having
finished
a
learned
discussion
on
the
manner
of
fleeing
a
hawk
at
the
river
and
on
the
field
,
as
taught
by
the
great
French
authorities
,
Martin
,
Malopin
,
and
Aimé
Cassian
,
with
the
Marquis
de
Tremouille
,
had
just
begun
a
similar
conversation
with
Giustiniano
as
to
the
Italian
mode
of
manning
,
hooding
,
and
reclaiming
a
falcon
,
as
practised
by
Messer
Francesco
Sforzino
Vicentino
,
when
he
caught
sight
of
the
Conde
de
Gondomar
,
standing
where
we
left
him
at
the
side
of
the
avenue
,
on
which
he
came
to
a
sudden
halt
,
and
the
whole
cavalcade
stopped
at
the
same
time
.
"Salud
!
<EOS>
Conde
magnifico
!
"
exclaimed
King
James
,
as
the
Spaniard
advanced
to
make
his
obeisance
to
him
;
"
how
is
it
that
we
find
you
standing
under
the
shade
of
the
tree
friendly
to
the
vine,—amictoe
vitibus
ulmi
as
Ovid
hath
it
?
<EOS>
Is
it
that
yon
blooming
Chloe
,
"
he
continued
,
leering
significantly
at
Gillian
,
"
hath
more
attraction
for
you
than
our
court
dames
?
<EOS>
Troth
!
<EOS>
the

a

,
Count
,
forbye

which
we
sall
na
particularize
.
<EOS>
We
hae
had
a
noble
flight
at
the
heron
,
and
anither
just
as
guid
after
the
bustard
.
<EOS>
God
's
santy
!
<EOS>
the

.
<EOS>
Lady
Exeter
,
on
her
braw
Spanish
barb
—
we
ken
whose
gift
it
is
—
was
the
only
one
able
to
keep
with
us
;
and
it
was
her
leddyship
's
ain
peregrine
falcon
that
checked
the
fleeing
carle
at
last
.
<EOS>
By
our
faith
the
Countess
understands
the
gentle
science
weel
.
<EOS>
She
cared
not
to
soil
her
dainty
gloves
by
rewarding
her
hawk
with
a
soppa
,
as
his
Excellency
Giustiniano
would
term
it
,
of
the
bustard
's
heart
,
bluid
,
and
brains
.
<EOS>
But
wha
hae
ye
gotten
wi
'
ye
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
for
the
first
time
noticing
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"A
young
gentleman
in
whom
I
am
much
interested
,
and
whom
I
would
crave
permission
to
present
to
your
Majesty
,
"
replied
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
"Saul
of
our
body
,
Count
,
the
permission
is
readily
granted
,
"
replied
James
,
evidently
much
pleased
with
the
young
man
's
appearance
.
"
<EOS>
Ye
shall
bring
him
to
us
in
the
privy
-
chamber
before
we
gang
to
supper
,
and
moreover
ye
shall
hae
full
licence
to
advance
what
you
please
in
his
behoof
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
weel
-
grown
,
weel
-
favoured
laddie
,
almost
as
much
sae
as
our
ain
dear
dog
Steenie
;
but
we
wad
say
to
him
,
in
the
words
of
the
Roman
bard,'O
formose
puer
,
nimium
ne
<EOS>
crede
<EOS>
colori!'Gude
pairts
are
better
than
gude
looks
;
not
that
the
latter
are
to
be
undervalued
,
but
baith
should
exist
in
the
same
person
.
<EOS>
We
shall
soon
discover
whether
the
young
man
hath
been
weel
nurtured
,
and
if
all
correspond
we
shall
not
refuse
him
the
light
of
our
countenance
.
<EOS>
""I
tender
your
Majesty
thanks
for
the
favour
you
have
conferred
upon
him
,
"
replied
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
ye
have
not
yet
tauld
us
the
youth
's
name
,
Count
?
"
said
the
King
.
<EOS>
"Your
Majesty
,
I
trust
,
will
not
think
I
make
a
mystery
where
none
is
needed
,
if
I
say
that
my
protegé
claims
your
gracious
permission
to
preserve
,
for
the
moment
,
his
incognito
,
"
De
Gondomar
replied
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
present
him
of
course
his
name
will
be
declared
.
<EOS>
""Be
it
as
you
will
,
Count
,
"
James
replied
.
<EOS>
"
We
ken
fu
'
weel
ye
hae
gude
reason
for
a
'
ye

.
<EOS>
Fail
not
in
your
attendance
on
us
at
the
time
appointed
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
De
Gondomar
with
a
profound
obeisance
drew
back
,
the
King
put
his
steed
in
motion
.
<EOS>
General
attention
having
been
thus
called
to
Jocelyn
,
all
eyes
were
turned
towards
him
,
his
appearance
and
attire
were
criticised
,
and
much
speculation
ensued
as
to
what
could
be
the
Spanish
Ambassador
's
motive
for
undertaking
the
presentation
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Lord
Roos
had
taken
advantage
of
the
brief
halt
of
the
hunting
party
to
approach
the
Countess
of
Exeter
,
and
pointing
out
Gillian
to
her
,
inquired
in
a
low
tone
,
and
in
a
few
words
,
to
which
,
however
,
his
looks
imparted
significance
,
whether
she
would
take
the
pretty
damsel
into
her
service
as
tire
-
woman
or
handmaiden
.
<EOS>
The
Countess
seemed
surprised
at
the
request
,
and
,
after
glancing
at
the
Beauty
of
Tottenham
,
was
about
to
refuse
it
,
when
Lord
Roos
urged
in
a
whisper
,
"
'
T
is
for
De
Gondomar
I
ask
the
favour
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
that
case
I
readily
assent
,
"
the
Countess
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
speak
to
the
damsel
at
once
,
if
you
desire
it
.
<EOS>
How
pretty
she
is
!
<EOS>
No
wonder
his
inflammable
Excellency
should
be
smitten
by
her
.
"
<EOS>
And
detaching
her
barb
,
as
she
spoke
,
from
the
cavalcade
,
she
moved
towards
Gillian
,
accompanied
by
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
The
pretty
damsel
was
covered
with
fresh
confusion
at
the
great
lady
's
approach
;
and
was
,
indeed
,
so
greatly
alarmed
,
that
she
might
have
taken
to
her
heels
,
if
she
had
been
on
the
ground
,
and
not
on
the
pillion
behind
her
grandsire
.
<EOS>
"Be
not
abashed
,
my
pretty
maiden
,
"
the
Countess
said
,
in
a
kind
and
encouraging
tone
;
"
there
is
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
.
<EOS>
Aware
that
I
am
in
want
of
a
damsel
like
yourself
,
to
tire
my
hair
and
attend
upon
me
,
Lord
Roos
has
drawn
my
attention
to
you
;
and
if
I
may
trust
to
appearances
—
as
I
think
I
may
,
"
she
added
,
with
a
very
flattering
and
persuasive
smile
,
"
in
your
case
<EOS>
—
you
are
the
very
person
to
suit
me
,
provided
you
are
willing
to
enter
my
service
.
<EOS>
I
am
the
Countess
of
Exeter
.
<EOS>
""A
Countess
!
"
exclaimed
Gillian
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hear
that
,
grandsire
?
<EOS>
The
beautiful
lady
is
a
countess
.
<EOS>
What
an
honour
it
would
be
to
serve
her!""It
might
be
,
"
the
old
man
replied
,
with
hesitation
,
and
in
a
whisper
;
"
yet
I
do
not
exactly
like
the
manner
of
it
.
<EOS>
""Don't
accept
the
offer
,
Gillian
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
go
,
"
said
Dick
Taverner
,
whose
breast
was
full
of
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
"Your
answer
,
my
pretty
maiden
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
Countess
said
,
with
a
winning
smile
.
<EOS>
"I
am
much
beholden
to
you
,
my
lady
,
"
Gillian
replied
,
"
and
it
will
delight
me
to
serve
you
as
you
propose
—
that
is
,
if
I
have
my
grandsire
's
consent
to
it
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
the
good
man
,
I
am
sure
,
has
your
welfare
too
much
at
heart
to
withhold
it
,
"
the
Countess
replied
.
<EOS>
"
But
follow
me
to
the
palace
,
and
we
will
confer
further
upon
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Inquire
for
the
Countess
of
Exeter
's
apartments
.
<EOS>
"
And
with
another
gracious
smile
,
she
rejoined
the
cavalcade
,
leaving
Lord
Roos
behind
.
<EOS>
He
thanked
her
with
a
look
for
her
complaisance
.
<EOS>
"O
Gillian
,
I
am
sure
ill
will
come
of
this
,
"
Dick
Taverner
exclaimed
.
"Wherefore
<EOS>
should
it
?
<EOS>
"
she
rejoined
,
almost
beside
herself
with
delight
at
the
brilliant
prospect
suddenly
opened
before
her
.
<EOS>
"
My
fortune
is
made
.
<EOS>
""You
are
right
,
my
pretty
damsel
,
it
is
,
"
Lord
Roos
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
Fail
not
to
do
as
the
Countess
has
directed
you
,
and
I
will
answer
for
the
rest
.
<EOS>
""You
hear
what
the
kind
young
nobleman
says
,
grandsire
?
"
<EOS>
Gillian
whispered
in
his
ear
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
doubt
his
assurance?""I
hear
it
all
,
"
old
Greenford
replied
;
"
but
I
know
not
what
to
think
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
must
go
to
the
palace
.
<EOS>
""To
<EOS>
be
sure
we
must
,
"
Gillian
cried
;
"
I
will
go
there
alone
,
if
you
will
not
go
with
me
.
<EOS>
"Satisfied
<EOS>
with
what
he
had
heard
,
Lord
Roos
moved
away
,
nodding
approval
at
Gillian
.
<EOS>
The
cavalcade
,
as
we
have
said
,
was
once
more
in
motion
,
but
before
it
had
proceeded
far
,
it
was
again
,
most
unexpectedly
,
brought
to
a
halt
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
stepping
from
behind
a
large
tree
which
had
concealed
him
from
view
,
a
man
in
military
habiliments
,
with
grizzled
hair
and
beard
,
and
an
exceedingly
resolute
and
stern
cast
of
countenance
,
planted
himself
directly
in
the
monarch
's
path
,
and
extending
his
hand
towards
him
,
exclaimed
,
in
a
loud
voice,"Stand
!
<EOS>
O
King!""Who
<EOS>
art
thou
,
fellow
?
<EOS>
and
what
wouldst
thou
?
"
demanded
James
,
who
had
checked
his
horse
with
such
suddenness
as
almost
to
throw
himself
out
of
his
high
-
holstered
saddle
.
<EOS>
"I
have
a
message
to
deliver
to
thee
from
Heaven
,
"
replied
Hugh
Calveley
.
"Aha
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
James
,
recovering
in
some
degree
,
for
he
thought
he
had
a
madman
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
"
What
may
thy
message
be?"IllustrationAnd
willing
to
gain
a
character
for
courage
,
though
it
was
wholly
foreign
to
his
nature
,
he
motioned
those
around
him
to
keep
back
.
"
<EOS>
Thy
message
,
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
he
repeated
.
<EOS>
"Hear
,
then
,
what
Heaven
saith
to
thee
,
"
the
Puritan
replied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
I
not
brought
thee
out
of
a
land
of
famine
into
a
land
of
plenty
?
<EOS>
Thou
oughtest
,
therefore
,
to
have
judged
my
people
righteously
!
<EOS>
But
thou
hast
perverted
justice
,
and
not
relieved
the
oppressed
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
unless
thou
repent
,
I
will
rend
thy
kingdom
from
thee
,
and
from
thy
posterity
after
thee
!
<EOS>
Thus
saith
the
Lord
,
whose
messenger
I
am
.

"CHAPTER
<EOS>
XXI.Consequences
of
the
Puritan
's
Warning
.
<EOS>
Coupling
Hugh
Calveley
's
present
strange
appearance
and
solemn
warning
with
his
previous
denunciations
uttered
in
secret
,
and
his
intimations
of
some
dread
design
,
with
which
he
had
sought
to
connect
the
young
man
himself
,
intimating
that
its
execution
would
jeopardize
his
life
;
putting
these
things
together
,
we
say
,
Jocelyn
could
not
for
an
instant
doubt
that
the
King
was
in
imminent
danger
,
and
he
felt
called
upon
to
interfere
,
even
though
he
should
be
compelled
to
act
against
his
father
's
friend
,
and
the
father
of
Aveline
.
<EOS>
No
alternative
,
in
fact
,
was
allowed
him
.
<EOS>
As
a
loyal
subject
,
his
duty
imperiously
required
him
to
defend
his
sovereign
;
and
perceiving
that
no
one
(
in
consequence
of
the
King
's
injunctions
)
advanced
towards
the
Puritan
,
Jocelyn
hastily
quitted
the
Conde
de
Gondomar
,
and
rushing
forward
stationed
himself
between
the
monarch
and
his
bold
admonisher
;
and
so
near
to
the
latter
,
that
he
could
easily
prevent
any
attack
being
made
by
him
upon
James
.
<EOS>
Evidently
disconcerted
by
the
movement
,
Hugh
Calveley
signed
to
the
young
man
to
stand
aside
,
but
Jocelyn
refused
compliance
;
the
rather
that
he
suspected
from
the
manner
in
which
the
other
placed
his
hand
in
his
breast
that
he
had
some
weapon
concealed
about
his
person
.
<EOS>
Casting
a
look
of
bitterest
reproach
at
him
,
which
plainly
as
words
<EOS>
said—"Ungrateful
boy
<EOS>
,
thou
hast
prevented
my
purpose
,
"
the
Puritan
folded
his
hands
upon
his
breast
with
an
air
of
deep
disappointment
.
"Fly
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jocelyn
,
in
a
tone
calculated
only
to
reach
his
ears
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
defend
you
with
my
life
.
<EOS>
Waste
not
another
moment
—
fly!"But
Hugh
Calveley
regarded
him
with
cold
disdain
,
and
though
he
moved
not
his
lips
,
he
seemed
to
say
,
"
You
have
destroyed
me
;
and
I
will
not
remove
the
guilt
of
my
destruction
from
your
head
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
Puritan
's
language
and
manner
had
filled
James
with
astonishment
and
fresh
alarm
;
but
feeling
secure
in
the
propinquity
of
Jocelyn
to
the
object
of
his
uneasiness
,
and
being
closely
environed
by
his
retinue
,
the
foremost
of
whom
had
drawn
their
swords
and
held
themselves
in
readiness
to
defend
him
from
the
slightest
hostile
attempt
,
it
was
not
unnatural
that
even
so
timorous
a
person
as
he
,
should
regain
his
confidence
.
<EOS>
Once
more
,
therefore
,
he
restrained
by
his
gestures
the
angry
impetuosity
of
the
nobles
around
him
,
who
were
burning
to
chastise
the
rash
intruder
,
and
signified
his
intention
of
questioning
him
before
any
measures
were
adopted
against
him
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
him
be
,
"
he
cried
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
some
puir
demented
creature
fitter
for
Bedlam
than
anywhere
else
;
and
we
will
see
that
he
be
sent
thither
;
but
molest
him
not
till
we
hae
spoken
wi
'
him
,
and
certified
his
condition
more
fully
.
<EOS>
Quit
not
the
position
ye
hae
sae
judiciously
occupied
,
young
Sir
,
albeit
against
our
orders
,
"
he
cried
to
Jocelyn
.
"
<EOS>
Dinna
draw
your
blade
unless
the
fellow
seeks
to
come
till
us
.
<EOS>
Not
that
we
are
under
ony
apprehension
;
but
there
are
bluidthirsty
traitors
even
in
our
pacific
territories
,
and
as
this
may
be
ane
of
them
,
it
is
weel
not
to
neglect
due
precaution

<EOS>
And
now

man

"
he
added
,
raising
his
voice
,
and
addressing
the
Puritan
,
who
still
maintained
a
steadfast
and
unmoved
demeanour
,
with
his
eye
constantly
fixed
upon
his
interrogator
.
"
<EOS>
Ye
say
ye
are
a
messenger
frae
heaven

<EOS>
An
it
be
sae,—whilk
we
take
leave
to
doubt
,
rather
conceiving
ye
to
be
an
envoy
from
the
Prince
of
Darkness
than
an
ambassador
from
above,—an
<EOS>
ill
choice
hath
been
made
in
ye

<EOS>
Unto
what
order
of
prophets
do
ye
conceive
yourself
to
belong?"To
this
interrogation
,
propounded
in
a
jeering
tone
,
the
Puritan
deigned
no
reply
;
but
an
answer
was
given
for
him
by
Archee
,
the
court
jester
,
who
had
managed
in
the
confusion
to
creep
up
to
his
royal
master
's
side
.
<EOS>
"He
belongs
to
the
order
of
Melchisedec
,
"
said
Archee
.
<EOS>
A
reply
that
occasioned
some
laughter
among
the
nobles
,
in
which
the
King
joined
heartily
.
<EOS>
"Tut
,
fule
!
<EOS>
ye
are
as
daft
as
the
puir
body
before
us

"
cried
James
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ken
ye
not
that
Melchisedec

a
priest

not
a

<EOS>
Like
aneuch
,
he
may
be
infected
with
the
heresy
of
the
Melchisedecians,—a
pestilent
sect
,
who
plagued
the
early
Christian
Church
sairly
,
placing
their
master
aboon
our
Blessed
Lord
himself

and
holding
him
to
be
identical

Melchisedecian

the
Puritan
replied

Profane

Sabbath"—"I
see
how
it
is

"
interrupted
Archee
with
a
scream
;
"
the
man
hath
been
driven
stark
wud
by
your
Majesty
's
Book
of
Sports

<EOS>
""A
book
devised
by
the
devil
,
"
cried
Hugh
Calveley
,
catching
at
the
suggestion
;
"
and
which
ought
to
be
publicly
burnt
by
the
hangman
,
instead

being
read

<EOS>
How
much

mischief
hath
that
book
done

<EOS>
How
many
abominations
hath
it
occasioned

<EOS>
And
,
alas

<EOS>
how
much
persecution
hath
it
caused

for
have
not

just

been
prosecuted

misnamed

known

<EOS>
as

suffering
stripes

imprisonment

refusing
to
read
thy
mischievous
proclamation

their
flocks

<EOS>
""I
knew
it!—I
knew
it

"
<EOS>
screamed
Archee
,
delighted
with
the
effect
he
had
produced
.
<EOS>
"
Take
heed
,

"
he
cried
to
the
Puritan
,
"
that

roared
James
,
far
more
enraged
at
the
disrespectful
mention
made
of
his
manifesto
,
than
by
anything
that
had
previously
occurred

<EOS>
"
The

<EOS>
""He

not

to
keep
his

"
rejoined
Archee
.
"
<EOS>
Your
Majesty
should
spare
him
,
since
you
are
indirectly
the
cause
of
his
malady
.
<EOS>
""Intercede
<EOS>
not
for
me
,
"
cried
Hugh
Calveley
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
accept
any
grace
at
the
tyrant

hands

<EOS>
Let
him
hew

out

<EOS>
""By
our
halidame

<EOS>
a
dangerous
traitor
!
"
exclaimed
James
.
<EOS>
"Hear
me
,
O
King
!
"
thundered
the
Puritan
.
"
<EOS>
For
the
third
and
last
time
I
lift
up
my
voice
to
warn
thee
.
<EOS>
Visions
have
appeared
to
me
in
the
night
,
and
mysterious
voices
have
whispered
in
mine
ear
.
<EOS>
They
have
revealed
to
me
strange
and
terrible
things
—
but
not
more
strange
and
terrible
than
true
.
<EOS>
They
have
told
me
how
thy
posterity
shall
suffer
for
the
injustice
thou
doest
to
thy
people
.
<EOS>
They
have
shown
me
a
scaffold
which
a
King
shall
mount
—
and
a
block
whereon
a
royal
head
shall
be
laid
.
<EOS>
But
it
shall
be
better
for
that
unfortunate
monarch
,
though
he
be
brought
to
judgment
by
his
people
,
than
for
him
who
shall
be
brought
to
judgment
by
his
God
.
<EOS>
Yet
more
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
in
my
visions
two
Kings
in
exile
:
one
of
whom
shall
be
recalled
,
but
the
other
shall
die
in
a
foreign
land
.
<EOS>
As
to
thee
,
thou
mayst
live
on
yet
awhile
in
fancied
security
.
<EOS>
But
destruction
shall
suddenly
overtake
thee
.
<EOS>
Thou
shalt
be
stung
to
death
by
the
serpent
thou
nourishest
in
thy
bosom
.
<EOS>
"Whatever
<EOS>
credit
might
be
attached
to
them
,
the
Puritan
's
prophetic
forebodings
produced
,
from
the
manner
in
which
they
were
delivered
,
a
strong
impression
upon
all
his
auditors
.
<EOS>
Unquestionably
the
man
was
in
earnest
,
and
spoke
like
one
who
believed
that
a
mission
had
been
entrusted
to
him
.
<EOS>
No
interruption
was
offered
to
his
speech
,
even
by
the
King
,
though
the
latter
turned
pale
as
these
terrible
coming
events
were
shadowed
forth
before
him
.
<EOS>
"His
<EOS>
words
are
awsome
,
"
he
muttered
,
"
and
gar

on

banes

<EOS>
Will

<EOS>
ye
stap

said
Archee
;

Deil

aught
to
allege
why
his
Majesty

not
tuck
thee
up
with
a
halter?""I
have
spoken

responded
the
Puritan
;
"
let
the
King
do
with
me
what
he
lists

<EOS>
""Seize

<EOS>
arrest

<EOS>

are
nearest

Sir

"
shouted
the
king
to
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
The
command
could
not
be
disobeyed
.
<EOS>
As
Jocelyn
drew
near
,
and
laid
his
hand
upon
Hugh
Calveley
,
the
latter
looked
reproachfully
at
him
,
saying
,
"
Thou
doest
<EOS>
well
,
son
of
my
old
friend
.
<EOS>
"Jocelyn
was
unable
to
reply
,
for
a
crowd
now
pressed
forward
on
all
sides
,
completely
surrounding
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
nobles
threatened
him
with
their
swords
,
and
the
warders
,
who
had
come
up
from
the
gateway
,
thrust
at
him
with
their
partizans
.
<EOS>
Jocelyn
had
great
difficulty
in
shielding
him
from
the
infuriated
throng
.
<EOS>
"Touch
<EOS>
him
not
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
clearing
a
space
around
them
with
the
point
of
his
sword
.
"
<EOS>
His
Majesty
has
committed
him
to
my
custody
,
and
I
am
responsible
for
him
.
<EOS>
Pardon
me
if
I
disarm
you
,
Sir
<EOS>
,
"
he
added
in
an
undertone
to
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"Here
is
my
sword
,
"
replied
Hugh
Calveley
,
unbuckling
his
belt
and
delivering
up
the
weapon
it
sustained
to
Jocelyn
;
"
it
hath
never
been
dishonoured
,
and
,
"
he
added
,
lowering
his
voice
,
"
<EOS>
it
hath
been
twice
drawn
in
thy
father
's
defence
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
reproach
cut
Jocelyn
to
the
heart
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
the
crowd
drew
aside
to
allow
the
King
's
approach
.
<EOS>
"Hath
<EOS>
he
been
searched
to
see
whether
any
deadly
or
offensive
weapon
is
concealed
about
him
?
"
demanded
James
.
<EOS>
"He
can
not
have
any
more
offensive
weapon
than
his
tongue
,
"
cried
Archee
,
who
accompanied
his
royal
master
.
<EOS>
"
I
counsel
your
Majesty
to
deprive
him
of
that
.
<EOS>
""There
is
something
hidden
in
his
breast

"
cried
one
of
the
warders
,
searching
in
his
jerkin
,
and
at
length
drawing
forth
a
short
,
clumsy
pistol
,
or
dag
,
as
the
weapon
was
then
called
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
loaded

an
please
your

"
the
man
continued
,
after
examining
it
.
<EOS>
Exclamations
of
horror
arose
from
those
around
,
and
Jocelyn
had
again
some
difficulty
in
protecting
the
prisoner
from
their
fury
.
<EOS>
"A
dag

<EOS>
ejaculated
James
,
"
a
loaded

crammed

Dost

Hugh
Calveley

""Heard

exclaimed
James
,

ruddy

blanched
with
fright

his

quavering

""Heaven

he
added
to
the
Spanish
Ambassador

around
drew
back
a
little
,
seeing

pleasure

"What

demanded
James

a
shade
crossing
his
countenance

did
not
escape
the
wily
ambassador
's
notice

""How

hearsay
—
for
ye
can
know
naething
o
'
your
ain
<EOS>
knowledge?""I
know
enough
to
be
satisfied
that
misrepresentations
were
made
to
your
Majesty
respecting
this
young
man
's
father
,
"
De
Gondomar
replied
;
"
for
I
am
well
assured
that
if
you
ever
erred
at
all
,
it
must
have
been
through
ignorance
,
and
want
of
due
information
.
<EOS>
This
was
what
I
designed
to
explain
more
fully
than
I
can
well
do
now
,
when
I
availed
myself
of
your
Majesty
's
gracious
permission
to
bring
the
young
man
into
your
presence
;
and
I
should
then
have
taken
leave
to
express
how
much
he
merited
your
Majesty
's
favour
and
protection
.
<EOS>
Fortune
,
however
,
has
outrun
my
wishes
,
and
given
him
a
stronger
claim
upon
you
than
any
I
could
urge
.
<EOS>
""Ye
are
right
,
Count
,
"
rejoined
James
cautiously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
hath
the
strongest
claim
upon
us
,
and
he
shall
not
find
us
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
We
will
confer
wi
'
Steenie
—
wi
'
Buckingham
,
we
mean
—
about
him
.
<EOS>
""Pardon
me
<EOS>
,
Sire
,
"
said
De
Gondomar
,
"
if
I
venture
to
suggest
that
your
Majesty
hath
an
admirable
opportunity
,
which
I
should
be
sorry
to
see
neglected
,
of
showing
your
goodness
and
clemency
,
and
silencing
for
ever
the
voice
of
calumny
,
which
will
sometimes
be
raised
against
you
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
mean
ye
,
Count
?
"
cried
James
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ye
wad
na
hae
me
pardon
yon
traitor?""Most
assuredly
not
,
Sire
,
"
De
Gondomar
rejoined
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
would
urge
some
present
mark
of
favour
for
him
who
hath
saved
you
from
the
traitor
's
fell
designs
.
<EOS>
And
I
am
emboldened
to
ask
this
,
because
I
feel
assured
it
must
be
consonant
to
your
Majesty
's
own
inclinations
to
grant
the
request
.
<EOS>
""It
is
sae
,
Count
,
"
rejoined
James
.
<EOS>
"
We
only
desired
to
consult
wi
'
Buckingham
to
ascertain
whether
he
had
ony
objections
;
but
as
this
is
altogether
unlikely
,
we
will
follow
our
ain
inclinations
and
do
as
your
Excellency
suggests
.
<EOS>
"De
Gondomar
could
scarcely
conceal
his
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Lord
Roos
pressed
towards
the
King
.
<EOS>
"I
have
something
to
say
in
reference
to
this
young
man
,
my
liege
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
his
favour
?
"
demanded
the
King
.
<EOS>
"Yes
,
yes
;
in
his
favour
,
Sire
,
"
said
De
Gondomar
,
looking
hard
at
the
young
nobleman
.
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
trouble
his
Majesty
further
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
He
is
graciously
pleased
to
accede
to
our
wishes
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
ay
;
nae
mair
need
be
said
,
"
cried
James
.
<EOS>
"
Let
the
young
man
stand
forward
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
as
Jocelyn
obeyed
the
injunction
which
was
immediately
communicated
to
him
by
De
Gondomar
,
the
King
bade
him
kneel
down
,
and
taking
Lord
Roos
's
sword
,
touched
him
with
it
upon
the
shoulder
,
exclaiming
,
"
Arise
!
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
""You
are
safe
now
,
"
whispered
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
first
blow
,
and
it
has
been
well
struck
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
confused
was
the
new
-
made
knight
by
the
honour
thus
unexpectedly
conferred
upon
him
,
that
when
he
rose
to
his
feet
he
could
scarcely
command
himself
sufficiently
to
make
the
needful
obeisance
,
and
tender
thanks
to
the
King
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
,
his
brow
was
flushed
with
pride
,
and
his
breast
beat
high
;
but
the
emotions
were
instantly
checked
,
as
he
thought
how
the
title
had
been
purchased
.
<EOS>
Looking
towards
the
prisoner
,
he
beheld
him
in
the
hands
of
the
warders
,
to
whose
custody
he
had
been
committed
,
with
his
arms
bound
behind
him
by
thongs
.
<EOS>
His
gaze
had
never
quitted
the
young
man
during
the
ceremony
which
had
just
taken
place
,
and
he
still
regarded
him
sternly
and
reproachfully
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
the
prisoner
be
removed
,
and
kept
in
a
place
of
safety
till
our
pleasure
respecting
him
be
made
known
,
"
cried
James
.
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
my
lords
and
ladies
,
let
us
forward
to
the
palace
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
the
cavalcade
was
once
more
put
in
motion
,
and
passing
through
the
great
gateway
entered
the
Fountain
Court
,
where
the
nobility
of
both
sexes
dismounted
,
while
their
attendants
and
the
falconers
and
varlets
passed
off
to
the
offices
.
<EOS>
The
prisoner
was
conveyed
to
the
porter
's
lodge
,
and
strictly
guarded
,
till
some
secure
chamber
could
be
prepared
for
him
.
<EOS>
On
the
way
thither
Jocelyn
contrived
to
approach
him
,
and
to
say
in
a
low
tone—"Can
<EOS>
I
do
aught
for
Aveline?""Concern
not
yourself
about
her
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
"
rejoined
Hugh
Calveley
,
with
stern
contempt
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
in
a
place
of
safety
.
<EOS>
You
will
never
behold
her
more
.

"CHAPTER
<EOS>
XXII.Wife
and
Mother
-
in
-
Law
.
<EOS>
Quick
steps
descended
the
narrow
staircase
—
steps
so
light
and
cautious
that
they
made
no
sound
.
<EOS>
Before
drawing
aside
the
arras
that
covered
the
secret
entrance
to
the
chamber
,
the
lady
paused
to
listen
;
and
hearing
nothing
to
alarm
her
,
she
softly
raised
a
corner
of
the
woof
and
looked
in
.
<EOS>
What
did
she
behold
?
<EOS>
A
young
man
seated
beside
a
carved
oak
table
,
with
his
back
towards
her
.
<EOS>
He
was
reading
a
letter
,
the
contents
of
which
seemed
greatly
to
disturb
him
,
for
he
more
than
once
dashed
it
aside
,
and
then
compelled
himself
to
resume
its
perusal
.
<EOS>
No
one
else
was
in
the
room
,
which
was
spacious
and
lofty
,
though
somewhat
sombre
,
being
wholly
furnished
with
dark
oak
;
while
the
walls
were
hung
with
ancient
tapestry
.
<EOS>
Heavy
curtains
were
drawn
before
the
deep
bay
windows
,
increasing
the
gloom
.
<EOS>
The
chamber
was
lighted
by
a
brass
lamp
suspended
from
the
moulded
ceiling
,
the
ribs
of
which
were
painted
,
and
the
bosses
,
at
the
intersections
,
gilded
.
<EOS>
Near
the
concealed
entrance
where
the
lady
stood
was
placed
a
large
curiously
-
carved
ebony
cabinet
,
against
which
leaned
a
suit
of
tilting
armour
and
a
lance
;
while
on
its
summit
were
laid
a
morion
,
a
brigandine
,
greaves
,
gauntlets
,
and
other
pieces
of
armour
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
of
the
cabinet
the
tapestry
was
looped
aside
,
disclosing
a
short
flight
of
steps
,
terminated
by
the
door
of
an
anti
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
Almost
as
the
lady
set
foot
within
the
room
,
which
she
did
after
a
brief
deliberation
,
dropping
the
arras
noiselessly
behind
her
,
the
young
man
arose
.
<EOS>
Her
entrance
had
not
been
perceived
,
so
violently
was
he
agitated
.
<EOS>
Crushing
the
letter
which
had
excited
him
so
much
between
his
fingers
,
and
casting
it
furiously
from
him
,
he
gave
vent
to
an
incoherent
expression
of
rage
.
<EOS>
Though
naturally
extremely
handsome
,
his
features
at
this
moment
were
so
distorted
by
passion
that
they
looked
almost
hideous
.
<EOS>
In
person
he
was
slight
and
finely
-
formed
;
and
the
richness
of
his
attire
proclaimed
him
of
rank
.
<EOS>
The
lady
who
,
unperceived
,
had
witnessed
his
violent
emotion
was
remarkably
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Her
figure
was
superb
;
and
she
had
the
whitest
neck
and
arms
imaginable
,
and
the
smallest
and
most
delicately
-
formed
hands
.
<EOS>
Her
features
derived
something
of
haughtiness
from
a
slightly
aquiline
nose
and
a
short
curled
upper
lip
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
magnificent
—
large
,
dark
,
and
almost
Oriental
in
shape
and
splendour
.
<EOS>
Jetty
brows
,
and
thick
,
lustrous
,
raven
hair
,
completed
the
catalogue
of
her
charms
.
<EOS>
Her
dress
was
of
white
brocade
,
over
which
she
wore
a
loose
robe
of
violet
-
coloured
velvet
,
with
open
hanging
sleeves
,
well
calculated
to
display
the
polished
beauty
of
her
arms
.
<EOS>
Her
ruff
was
of
point
lace
,
and
round
her
throat
<EOS>
she
wore
a
carcanet
of
pearls
,
while
other
precious
stones
glistened
in
her
dusky
tresses
.
<EOS>
This
beautiful
dame
,
whose
proud
lips
were
now
more
compressed
than
usual
,
and
whose
dark
eyes
emitted
fierce
rays
—
very
different
from
their
customary
tender
and
voluptuous
glances
—
was
the
Countess
of
Exeter
.
<EOS>
He
whom
she
looked
upon
was
Lord
Roos
,
and
the
chamber
she
had
just
entered
was
the
one
assigned
to
the
young
nobleman
in
the
Palace
of
Theobalds
.
<EOS>
She
watched
him
for
some
time
with
curiosity
.
<EOS>
At
length
his
rage
found
vent
in
words
.
<EOS>
"Perdition
<EOS>
seize
them
both
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
smiting
his
forehead
with
his
clenched
hand
.
"
<EOS>
Was
ever
man
cursed
with
wife
and
mother
-
in
-
law
like
mine
!
<EOS>
They
will
,
perforce
,
drive
me
to
desperate
measures
,
which
I
would
willingly
avoid
;
but
if
nothing
else
will
keep
them
quiet
,
the
grave
must
.
<EOS>
Ay
,
the
grave
,
"
he
repeated
in
a
hollow
voice
;
"
it
is
not
my
fault
if
I
am
compelled
to
send
them
thither
.
<EOS>
Fools
to
torment
me
<EOS>
thus!"Feeling
<EOS>
she
had
heard
more
than
she
ought
,
the
Countess
would
have
retired
;
but
as
retreat
might
have
betrayed
her
,
she
deemed
it
better
to
announce
her
presence
by
saying,"You
are
not
alone
,
my
Lord
.
<EOS>
"Startled
<EOS>
by
her
voice
,
Lord
Roos
instantly
turned
,
and
regarded
her
with
haggard
looks
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
here
,
Frances
?
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
;
"
I
did
not
expect
you
so
soon
.
<EOS>
""I
came
before
the
hour
,
because
—
but
you
seem
greatly
agitated
.
<EOS>
Has
anything
happened?""Little
more
than
what
happens
daily
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
it
ismore
;
for
the
crisis
has
arrived
,
and
a
fearful
crisis
it
is
.
<EOS>
O
,
Frances
!
"
<EOS>
he
continued
vehemently
,
"
how
dear
you
are
to
me
.
<EOS>
To
preserve
your
love
I
would
dare
everything
,
even
my
soul
's
welfare
.
<EOS>
I
would
hesitate
at
no
crime
to
keep
you
ever
near
me
.
<EOS>
Let
those
beware
who
would
force
you
from
me
.
<EOS>
""What
means
this
passion
,
my
Lord
?
"
inquired
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
means
that
since
there
are
those
who
will
mar
our
happiness
;
who
,
jealous
of
our
loves
,
will
utterly
blight
and
destroy
them
;
who
will
tear
us
forcibly
asunder
,
recking
little
of
the
anguish
they
occasion
:
since
we
have
enemies
who
will
do
this
;
who
will
mortally
wound
us
—
<EOS>
let
us
no
longer
hesitate
,
but
strike
the
first
blow
.
<EOS>
We
must
rid
ourselves
of
them
at
any
cost
,
and
in
any
way
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
affect
to
misunderstand
you
,
my
Lord
,
"
the
Countess
replied
,
her
beautiful
features
beginning
to
exhibit
traces
of
terror
.
<EOS>
"
But
has
it
arrived
at
this
point
?
<EOS>
Is
the
danger
imminent
and
inevitable?""Imminent
,
but
not
inevitable
,
"
Lord
Roos
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
It
can
be
avoided
,
as
I
have
hinted
,
in
one
way
,
and
in
one
way
only
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
letter
I
have
just
received
from
my
wife
;
wherein
,
after
her
usual
upbraidings
,
remonstrances
,
and
entreaties
,
she
concludes
by
saying
,
that
if
I
continue
deaf
to
her
prayers
,
and
refuse
to
break
off
entirely
with
you
,
and
return
to
her
,
our
'
criminal
attachment,'—for
<EOS>
so
she
terms
our
love
—
should
be
divulged
to
the
deluded
Earl
of
Exeter
,
who
will
know
how
to
redress
her
wrongs
,
and
avenge
his
own
injured
honour
.
<EOS>
What
answer
,
save
one
,
can
be
returned
to
that
letter
,
Frances
?
<EOS>
If
we
set
her
at
defiance
,
as
we
have
hitherto
done
,
she
will
act
,
for
she
is
goaded
on
by
that
fury
,
her
mother
.
<EOS>
We
must
gain
a
little
time
,
in
order
that
the
difficulties
now
besetting
us
may
be
effectually
removed
.
<EOS>
""I
shudder
to
think
of
it
,
William
,
"
said
the
Countess
,
trembling
and
turning
deathly
pale
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
;
it
must
not
be
.
<EOS>
Rather
than
such
a
crime
should
be
committed
,
I
will
comply
with
their
demand
.
<EOS>
""And
leave
me
?
"
cried
Lord
Roos
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Frances
,
your
affection
is
not
equal
to
mine
,
or
you
could
not
entertain
such
a
thought
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
You
almost
make
me
suspect
,
"
he
added
,
sternly
,
"
that
you
have
transferred
your
love
to
another
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
beware
!
<EOS>
beware
!
<EOS>
I
am
not
to
be
trifled
with
,
like
your
husband
.
<EOS>
""I
forgive
you
the
doubt
,
my
Lord
—
unjust
though
it
be
—
because
your
mind
is
disturbed
;
but
were
you
calm
enough
to
view
the
matter
as
it
really
is
,
you
would
perceive
that
my
resolution
has
nothing
in
it
inconsistent
with
affection
for
you
;
but
rather
that
my
very
love
for
you
compels
me
to
the
step
.
<EOS>
What
I
propose
is
best
for
both
of
us
.
<EOS>
The
remedy
you
suggest
would
work
our
ruin
here
and
hereafter
;
would
drive
us
from
society
,
and
render
us
hateful
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
My
soul
revolts
at
it
.
<EOS>
And
though
I
myself
have
received
a
mortal
affront
from
your
wife
's
mother
,
Lady
Lake
;
though
she
has
poured
forth
all
the
malice
of
which
she
is
capable
upon
my
devoted
head
;
yet
I
would
rather
forgive
her
—
rather
sue
for
pity
from
her
than
go
the
fearful
length
you
propose
.
<EOS>
No
,
William
.
<EOS>
The
pang
of
parting
from
you
will
indeed
be
terrible
,
but
it
must
be
endured
.
<EOS>
Fate
wills
it
so
,
and
it
is
therefore
useless
to
struggle
against
it
.
<EOS>
""O
,
recall
those
words
,
Frances
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
young
nobleman
,
throwing
himself
at
her
feet
,
and
clasping
her
hands
passionately
.
"
<EOS>
Recall
them
,
I
implore
'
of
you
.
<EOS>
In
uttering
them
you
pronounce
my
doom
—
a
doom
more
dreadful
than
death
,
which
would
be
light
in
comparison
with
losing
you
.
<EOS>
Plunge
this
sword
to
my
heart
,
"
he
exclaimed
,
plucking
the
shining
weapon
from
his
side
,
and
presenting
it
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
Free
me
from
my
misery
at
once
,
but
do
not
condemn
me
to
lingering
agony
.
<EOS>
""Rise
,
William
!
<EOS>
rise
,
I
pray
of
you
,
"
ejaculated
the
Countess
,
overcome
by
the
intensity
of
his
emotion
,
"
and
put
up
your
sword
.
<EOS>
The
love
you
display
for
me
deserves
an
adequate
return
,
and
it
shall
meet
it
.
<EOS>
Come
what
will
,
I
will
not
leave
you
.
<EOS>
But
,
O
!
let
us
not
plunge
deeper
in
guilt
if
it
can
be
avoided
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
how
can
it
be
avoided
?
"
cried
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
"
Will
they
listen
to
our
prayers
?
<EOS>
Will
they
pity
us
?
<EOS>
Will
they
hesitate
at
our
destruction?""I
know
not
—
I
know
not
,
"
replied
the
Countess
,
bewildered
;
"
but
I
stand
appalled
before
the
magnitude
of
the
offence
.
<EOS>
""They
will
not
spare
us
,
"
pursued
Lord
Roos
;
"
and
therefore
we
can
not
spare
them
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
my
turn
<EOS>
I
bend
to
you
,
William
,
"
said
the
Countess
,
sinking
on
her
knee
before
him
,
and
taking
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
By
the
love
you
bear
me
,
I
beseech
you
not
to
harm
your
wife
!
<EOS>
We
have
wronged
her
deeply
—
let
us
not
have
her
death
to
answer
for
.
<EOS>
If
the
blow
must
fall
,
let
it
be
upon
the
mother
's
head
.
<EOS>
I
have
less
compassion
for
her
.
<EOS>
""Lady
<EOS>
Lake
deserves
no
compassion
,
"
replied
Lord
Roos
,
raising
the
Countess
,
and
embracing
her
tenderly
,
"
for
she
is
the
cause
of
all
this
mischief
.
<EOS>
It
is
to
her
agency
<EOS>
we
owe
the
storm
which
threatens
us
with
ruin
.
<EOS>
But
things
have
gone
too
far
now
to
show
compunction
for
either
of
them
.
<EOS>
Our
security
demands
that
both
should
be
removed
.
<EOS>
""I
may
now
say
as
you
have
just
said
,
William
,
and
with
,
far
greater
reason
,
"
cried
the
Countess
,
"
that
you
love
me
not
,
or
you
would
not
refuse
my
request
.
<EOS>
""How
<EOS>
can
I
comply
with
it
?
<EOS>
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
were
done
,
if
only
partly
done
.
<EOS>
Know
you
the
charge
that
Lady
Roos
means
to
bring
against
you
?
<EOS>
Though
alike
false
and
improbable
,
it
is
one
to
find
easy
credence
with
the
King
;
and
it
has
been
framed
with
that
view
.
<EOS>
You
will
understand
this
,
when
I
tell
you
what
it
is
.
<EOS>
In
this
letter
,
"
he
added
,
picking
up
the
paper
he
had
thrown
down
,
and
unfolding
it
,
"
she
accuses
you
of
practising
sorcery
to
enslave
my
affections
.
<EOS>
She
declares
you
have
bewitched
me
;
and
that
she
has
proof
of
the
manner
in
which
it
was
done
,
and
of
the
sinful
compact
you
have
entered
into
for
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
""O
William
!
<EOS>
this
is
false
—
utterly
false
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
Countess
,
in
despair
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
know
it
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
need
to
practise
other
enchantments
with
me
than
those
you
possess
by
nature
.
<EOS>
But
what
I
tell
you
will
show
you
the
extent
of
their
malice
,
and
steel
your
heart
,
as
it
hath
already
steeled
mine
,
against
them
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
this
accusation
is
too
monstrous
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
be
believed
,
"
cried
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
"Monstrous
<EOS>
as
it
is
,
it
is
more
likely
to
be
believed
—
more
certain
to
be
maintained
—
than
the
other
which
they
lay
at
our
door
.
<EOS>
We
may
deny
all
their
assertions
;
may
intimidate
or
give
the
lie
to
the
witnesses
they
may
produce
against
us
;
may
stamp
as
forgeries
your
letters
which
have
unluckily
fallen
into
their
hands
;
but
if
this
charge
of
witchcraft
be
once
brought
against
you
,
it
will
not
fall
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
The
King
will
listen
to
it
,
because
it
flatters
his
prejudices
;
and
even
my
voice
would
fail
to
save
you
from
condemnation
—
from
the
stake
.
""Horrible
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Lady
Exeter
spreading
her
hands
before
her
eyes
,
as
if
to
exclude
some
dreadful
object
.
<EOS>
"
O
to
live
in
an
age
when
such
enormities
can
be
perpetrated
!
<EOS>
when
such
frightful
weapons
can
be
used
against
the
innocent
—
for
I
am
innocent
,
at
least
of
this
offence
.
<EOS>
All
seems
against
me
;
all
doors
of
escape
—
save
one
—
closed
.
<EOS>
And
whither
does
that
door
lead
?
<EOS>
To
the
Bottomless
Pit
,
if
there
be
truth
in
aught
we
are
told
by
Heaven
.
<EOS>
"Lord
<EOS>
Roos
seemed
unable
or
unwilling
to
reply
;
and
a
deep
pause
ensued
for
a
few
moments
,
during
which
the
guilty
pair
shunned
each
other
's
regards
.
<EOS>
It
was
broken
at
length
by
Lady
Exeter
,
who
said
,
reproachfully
,
"
You
should
have
burnt
my
letters
,
William
.
<EOS>
Without
them
,
they
would
have
had
no
evidence
against
me
.
<EOS>
Imprudent
that
you
were
,
you
have
destroyed
me!""Reproach
me
not
,
Prances
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
I
admit
my
imprudence
,
and
blame
myself
severely
for
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
not
part
with
a
line
I
had
received
from
you
.
<EOS>
I
inclosed
the
letters
in
a
little
coffer
,
which
I
deposited
in
a
secret
drawer
of
that
cabinet
,
as
in
a
place
of
perfect
safety
.
<EOS>
The
coffer
and
its
contents
mysteriously
disappeared
.
<EOS>
How
it
was
purloined
I
can
not
inform
you
.
<EOS>
""Do
your
suspicions
alight
on
no
one
?
<EOS>
"
she
inquired
.
<EOS>
"They
have
fallen
on
several
;
but
I
have
no
certainty
that
I
have
been
right
in
any
instance
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
That
I
have
some
spy
near
me
,
I
am
well
aware
;
and
if
I
detect
him
,
he
shall
pay
for
his
perfidy
with
his
life
.
""Hist
!
"
cried
Lady
Exeter
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
not
hear
a
noise?""No
,
"
he
rejoined
.
"
<EOS>
Where?"She
pointed
to
the
little
passage
leading
to
the
ante
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
He
instantly
went
thither
,
and
examined
the
place
,
but
without
discovering
any
listener
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
is
no
one
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
returned
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
one
,
in
fact
,
could
have
obtained
admittance
without
my
knowledge
,
for
my
Spanish
servant
,
Diego
,
in
whom
I
can
place
full
confidence
,
is
stationed
without
.
<EOS>
""I
distrust
<EOS>
that
man
,
William
,
"
she
observed
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
asked
whom
you
thought
had
removed
the
letters
,
my
own
suspicions
had
attached
to
him
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
think
he
would
have
done
it
,
"
Lord
Roos
replied
.
<EOS>
"
He
has
ever
served
me
faithfully
;
and
,
besides
,
I
have
a
guarantee
for
his
fidelity
in
the
possession
of
a
secret
on
which
his
own
life
hangs
.
<EOS>
I
can
dispose
of
him
as
I
please
.
<EOS>
""Again
that
sound
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
some
one
is
there
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
ears
have
deceived
you
,
"
said
the
young
nobleman
,
after
examining
the
spot
once
more
,
and
likewise
the
secret
entrance
by
which
the
Countess
had
approached
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
nothing
,
and
can
find
nothing
.
<EOS>
Your
nerves
are
shaken
,
and
make
you
fanciful
.
<EOS>
""It
may
be
so
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
evident
she
was
not
convinced
,
for
she
lowered
her
tones
almost
to
a
whisper
as
she
continued
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
that
the
question
she
designed
to
put
was
one
she
dared
not
ask
aloud
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
means
do
you
purpose
to
employ
in
the
execution
of
your
design?""The
same
as
those
employed
by
Somerset
and
his
Countess
in
the
removal
of
Sir
Thomas
Overbury
;
but
more
expeditious
and
more
certain
,
"
he
replied
under
his
breath
.
"Dreadful
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
with
a
shudder
.
"
<EOS>
But
the
same
judgment
that
overtook
the
Somersets
may
overtake
us
.
<EOS>
Such
crimes
are
never
hidden
.
<EOS>
""Crimes
<EOS>
fouler
than
theirs
have
never
been
brought
to
light
,
and
never
will
.
<EOS>
There
was
one
in
which
Somerset
himself
was
concerned
,
involving
the
destruction
of
a
far
higher
personage
than
Overbury
;
and
this
dare
not
even
be
hinted
at
.
<EOS>
""Because
<EOS>
the
greatest
person
in
the
land
was
connected
with
it
,
"
returned
the
Countess
,
"
<EOS>
I
conclude
you
refer
to
the
death
of
Prince
Henry?""I
<EOS>
do
,
"
answered
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
"
Somerset
would
never
have
been
questioned
about
Overbury
,
if
his
fall
had
not
been
resolved
upon
by
the
King
.
<EOS>
""One
<EOS>
other
question
,
and
<EOS>
I
ask
no
more
,
"
said
the
Countess
,
scarcely
able
to
syllable
her
words
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
to
administer
the
deadly
draught?""Luke
Hatton
,
Lady
Lake
's
apothecary
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
creature
of
mine
,
and
entirely
devoted
to
me
.
<EOS>
""Our
<EOS>
lives
will
be
in
his
hands
ever
afterwards
,
"
said
the
Countess
,
in
a
deep
whisper
.
<EOS>
"They
will
be
in
safe
keeping
,
"
he
rejoined
,
endeavouring
to
reassure
her
.
<EOS>
"O
,
William
!
<EOS>
I
would
I
could
prevail
upon
you
to
defer
this
project
.
<EOS>
""To
<EOS>
what
end
?
<EOS>
The
sooner
it
is
done
the
better
.
<EOS>
It
can
not
,
indeed
,
be
deferred
.
<EOS>
I
shall
send
for
Luke
Hatton
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
announcement
,
the
Countess
,
who
had
gradually
been
growing
fainter
and
becoming
paler
,
lost
all
power
of
supporting
herself
,
and
,
uttering
a
cry
,
fell
into
his
outstretched
arms
in
a
state
of
complete
insensibility
.
<EOS>
While
Lord
Roos
,
half
distracted
,
was
considering
what
means
he
could
adopt
for
her
restoration
,
a
man
,
with
an
almost
tawny
complexion
,
hair
and
eyes
to
match
,
and
habited
in
the
young
nobleman
's
livery
of
crimson
and
white
,
suddenly
entered
from
the
ante
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
dare
you
come
in
unsummoned
,
Diego
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Lord
Roos
,
furiously
.
"
<EOS>
Begone
instantly
,
sirrah!"
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
crave
your
lordship
's
pardon
,
"
replied
the
Spanish
servant
;
"
but
I
was
obliged
to
apprise
you
that
your
wife
,
the
Baroness
Roos
,
and
Lady
Lake
are
without
,
and
will
not
be
denied
admission
.
<EOS>
""Damnation
!
"
exclaimed
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
"
What
brings
them
here
at
such
an
hour
?
<EOS>
But
you
must
on
no
account
admit
them
,
Diego
—
at
least
,
till
I
have
had
time
to
remove
the
Countess
to
her
own
chamber
.
<EOS>
What
a
cursed
mischance!"Diego
instantly
withdrew
,
apparently
to
obey
his
lord
's
command
;
but
he
had
scarcely
entered
the
little
passage
when
two
ladies
pushed
past
him
,
and
made
their
way
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
They
arrived
just
in
time
to
intercept
Lord
Roos
,
who
was
conveying
his
insensible
burthen
towards
the
secret
staircase
.
<EOS>
The
young
nobleman
was
as
much
confounded
by
their
appearance
as
if
two
spectres
had
risen
before
him
.
<EOS>
Both
ladies
were
very
richly
attired
,
and
the
younger
of
the
two
was
by
no
means
destitute
of
beauty
,
though
of
a
pale
and
pensive
character
.
<EOS>
The
elder
had
a
full
,
noble
figure
,
haughty
features
,
now
lighted
up
with
a
smile
of
triumph
as
she
gazed
on
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
Very
different
was
the
expression
of
the
other
,
who
seemed
so
much
grieved
and
agitated
by
what
she
beheld
,
as
to
be
almost
ready
to
lapse
into
the
same
condition
as
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
If
Lord
Roos
could
have
seen
the
grin
upon
Diego
's
swarthy
visage
,
as
he
stood
at
the
entrance
of
the
passage
leading
to
the
ante
-
chamber
,
he
would
have
had
little
doubt
to
whom
he
was
indebted
for
this
surprise
.
<EOS>
It
is
needless
to
say
that
the
ladies
who
had
thus
broken
upon
Lord
Roos
's
privacy
,
and
obtained
full
confirmation
of
their
suspicions
(
if
they
had
any
doubts
remaining
)
were
his
wife
and
mother
-
in
-
law
.

CHAPTER
<EOS>
XXIII.The
Tress
of
Hair
.
<EOS>
How
to
extricate
himself
from
the
dilemma
in
which
he
was
placed
,
Lord
Roos
scarcely
knew
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
a
good
deal
of
self
-
possession
,
and
it
did
not
desert
him
on
the
present
trying
occasion
.
<EOS>
After
such
consideration
as
circumstances
permitted
,
he
could
discern
only
one
chance
of
escape
,
and
<EOS>
though
well
-
nigh
hopeless
,
he
resolved
to
adopt
it
.
<EOS>
If
consummate
audacity
could
carry
him
through
—
and
it
was
required
in
the
present
emergency
—
he
had
no
lack
of
it
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
not
a
word
had
passed
between
him
and
the
intruders
on
his
privacy
.
<EOS>
Lady
Lake
seemed
to
enjoy
his
confusion
too
much
to
do
anything
to
relieve
it
,
and
his
wife
was
obliged
to
regulate
her
movements
by
those
of
her
mother
.
<EOS>
Without
breaking
the
silence
,
which
by
this
time
had
become
painfully
oppressive
,
he
proceeded
to
deposit
the
still
inanimate
person
of
the
Countess
of
Exeter
upon
a
couch
,
and
,
casting
a
handkerchief
,
as
if
undesignedly
,
over
her
face
,
he
marched
quickly
up
to
the
spot
where
Diego
was
standing
,
and
said
to
him
,
in
a
deep
,
determined
tone
,
but
so
low
as
not
to
be
overheard
by
the
others:"You
have
betrayed
me
,
villain
;
and
unless
you
obey
me
unhesitatingly
,
and
corroborate
all
my
assertions
,
however
startling
they
may
appear
,
you
shall
pay
for
your
treachery
with
your
life
.
<EOS>
"This
<EOS>
done
,
he
turned
towards
the
two
ladies
,
and
with
more
calmness
than
might
have
been
expected
,
addressed
himself
to
Lady
Lake:"You
<EOS>
imagine
you
have
made
an
important
discovery
,
Madam
,
"
he
said
;
"
a
discovery
which
will
place
me
and
a
noble
lady
,
whose
reputation
you
and
your
daughter
seek
to
injure
,
in
great
perplexity
.
<EOS>
And
you
conclude
that
,
being
completely
(
as
you
fancy
)
in
your
power
,
I
shall
consent
to
any
terms
you
and
Lady
Roos
may
propose
,
rather
than
suffer
you
to
go
forth
from
this
chamber
and
reveal
what
you
have
seen
in
it
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
so
,
Madam?""Ay
,
my
lord
,
"
Lady
Lake
replied
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
stated
the
matter
correctly
enough
,
except
in
one
particular
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
imagine
we
have
made
a
discovery
;
because
we
are
quite
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
fancy
you
will
agree
to
our
terms
;
because
we
are
certain
you
will
only
too
gladly
screen
yourself
and
the
partner
of
your
guilt
from
exposure
and
disgrace
,
at
any
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
And
allow
me
to
observe
,
that
the
tone
adopted
by
your
lordship
is
neither
befitting
the
circumstances
in
which
you
are
placed
,
nor
the
presence
in
which
you
stand
.
<EOS>
Some
sense
of
shame
must
at
least
be
left
you
—
some
show
of
respect
(
if
nothing
more
)
ought
to
be
observed
towards
your
injured
wife
.
<EOS>
Were
I
acting
alone
in
this
matter
,
I
would
show
you
and
my
lady
of
Exeter
no
consideration
whatever
;
but
I
can
not
resist
the
pleadings
of
my
daughter
;
and
for
her
sake
—
and
hers
alone
—
I
am
content
to
suspend
the
blow
,
unless
forced
to
strike
;
in
which
case
,
nothing
shall
stay
my
hands
.
<EOS>
""I
thank
your
ladyship
for
your
clemency
,
"
said
Lord
Roos
,
with
mock
humility
.
<EOS>
"O
,
my
dear
lord
!
<EOS>
do
not
for
ever
close
the
door
between
us
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Lady
Roos
.
<EOS>
"
Return
to
me
,
and
all
shall
be
forgiven
.
<EOS>
""Peace
,
Elizabeth
!
"
exclaimed
Lady
Lake
,
impatiently
.
"
<EOS>
Know
you
not
,
from
sad
experience
,
that
your
husband
is
inaccessible
to
all
gentle
entreaty
?
<EOS>
His
heart
is
steeled
to
pity
.
<EOS>
Solicit
not
that
which
is
your
right
,
and
which
must
be
conceded
,
whether
he
like
or
not
.
<EOS>
Let
him
bend
the
knee
to
you
.
<EOS>
Let
him
promise
amendment
,
and
implore
pardon
,
and
it
will
then
be
for
you
to
consider
whether
you
will
extend
forgiveness
to
him
.
<EOS>
"Lady
<EOS>
Roos
looked
as
if
she
would
fain
interrupt
her
mother
,
but
she
was
too
much
under
her
subjection
to
offer
a
remark
.
<EOS>
"It
is
time
to
undeceive
you
,
Madam
,
"
said
Lord
Roos
,
wholly
unmoved
by
what
was
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
in
the
strait
you
suppose
;
and
have
not
the
slightest
intention
of
soliciting
Lady
Roos
's
pardon
,
or
making
any
promise
to
her
.
<EOS>
""O
mother
!
<EOS>
you
see
that
even
you
fail
to
move
him
,
"
said
Lady
Roos
,
tearfully
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
to
happen
to
me?""You
will
make
me
chide
you
,
daughter
,
if
you
exhibit
this
weakness
,
"
cried
Lady
Lake
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
deal
with
him
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
your
affected
confidence
,
my
lord
,
you
can
not
be
blind
to
the
position
in
which
you
stand
.
<EOS>
And
though
you
yourself
personally
may
be
careless
of
the
consequences
of
a
refusal
of
our
demands
,
you
can
not
,
I
conceive
,
be
equally
indifferent
to
the
fate
of
the
Countess
of
Exeter
,
which
that
refusal
will
decide
.
<EOS>
""I
am
so
little
indifferent
to
the
safety
of
the
Countess
,
Madam
,
that
I
can
not
sufficiently
rejoice
that
she
is
out
of
the
reach
of
your
malice
.
<EOS>
""How
,
my
lord
!
"
exclaimed
Lady
Lake
,
astounded
at
his
assurance
.
<EOS>
"
Out
of
reach
,
when
she
is
here
!
<EOS>
You
can
not
mean
,
"
she
added
,
with
an
undefinable
expression
of
satisfaction
,
"
that
she
is
dead?""Dead
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Lady
Roos
;
"
the
Countess
dead
!
<EOS>
I
thought
she
was
only
in
a
swoon
.
<EOS>
""What
riddle
is
it
<EOS>
you
would
have
us
read
,
my
lord
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
riddle
<EOS>
whatever
,
Madam
,
"
replied
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
mean
to
assert
that
the
person
you
behold
upon
that
couch
is
not
the
Countess
of
Exeter
.
<EOS>
""Not
the
Countess
!
"
exclaimed
Lady
Roos
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
if
this
were
possible
!
<EOS>
But
no
,
no
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
be
deceived
.
<EOS>
""I
now
see
the
reason
why
her
face
has
been
covered
with
a
'
kerchief
,
"
cried
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
shall
not
save
her
from
our
scrutiny
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
she
advanced
towards
the
couch
,
with
the
intention
of
removing
the
covering
,
when
Lord
Roos
barred
her
approach
.
"Not
<EOS>
a
step
nearer
,
Madam
<EOS>
,
"
he
cried
,
in
a
peremptory
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
allow
you
to
gratify
your
curiosity
further
.
<EOS>
You
and
Lady
Roos
may
make
the
most
of
what
you
have
seen
;
and
proclaim
abroad
any
tale
your
imaginations
may
devise
forth
.
<EOS>
You
will
only
render
yourselves
ridiculous
,
and
encounter
derision
in
lieu
of
sympathy
.
<EOS>
No
one
will
credit
your
assertions
,
because
I
shall
be
able
to
prove
that
,
at
this
moment
,
Lady
Exeter
is
in
a
different
part
of
the
palace
.
<EOS>
""This
bold
falsehood
will
not
serve
your
turn
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
Whoever
she
may
be
,
the
person
on
that
couch
shall
be
seized
,
and
we
shall
then
ascertain
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
she
would
have
moved
towards
the
door
,
if
Lord
Roos
had
not
caught
hold
of
her
arm
,
while
at
the
same
time
he
drew
his
sword
.
<EOS>
Thinking
from
his
fierce
looks
and
menacing
gestures
that
her
mother
might
be
sacrificed
to
his
fury
,
Lady
Roos
fell
on
her
knees
before
him
,
imploring
pity
;
and
she
continued
in
this
supplicating
posture
till
Lady
Lake
angrily
bade
her
rise
.
<EOS>
"You
have
come
here
without
my
permission
,
Madam
,
"
Lord
Roos
cried
furiously
to
his
mother
-
in
-
law
,
"
and
you
shall
not
depart
until
I
choose
.
<EOS>
Secure
the
door
,
Diego
,
and
bring
me
the
key
.
<EOS>
It
is
well
,
"
he
continued
,
as
the
injunction
was
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Lady
Lake
submitted
without
resistance
to
the
constraint
imposed
upon
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
well
do
otherwise
;
for
though
her
screams
would
have
brought
aid
,
it
might
have
arrived
too
late
.
<EOS>
And
,
after
all
,
she
did
not
intend
to
settle
matters
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
But
she
betrayed
no
symptoms
of
fear
,
and
,
as
we
have
stated
,
ordered
her
daughter
to
discontinue
her
supplications
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
now
,
Madam
,
"
said
Lord
Roos
,
releasing
Lady
Lake
,
as
he
took
the
key
from
Diego
,
"
I
will
tell
you
who
that
person
is
,
"
pointing
to
the
couch
.
<EOS>
"Add
<EOS>
not
to
the
number
of
falsehoods
you
have
already
told
,
my
lord
,
"
rejoined
Lady
Lake
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
perfectly
aware
who
she
is
.
<EOS>
""But
I
would
fain
hear
his
explanation
,
mother
,
"
said
Lady
Roos
.
<EOS>
"What
explanation
can
be
offered
?
"
cried
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
doubt
the
evidence
of
your
senses?""I
<EOS>
know
not
what
I
doubt
,
or
what
I
believe
,
"
exclaimed
Lady
Roos
distractedly
.
<EOS>
"Then
believe
what
I
tell
you
,
Bess
,
"
said
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
countess
's
handmaiden
,
Gillian
Greenford
.
<EOS>
""An
impudent
lie
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"A
truth
,
my
lady
,
"
interposed
Diego
.
<EOS>
"
A
truth
to
which
I
am
ready
to
swear
.
<EOS>
""No
doubt
of
it
,
thou
false
knave
,
and
double
traitor
!
<EOS>
thou
art
worthy
of
thy
lord
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
lie
,
however
absurd
and
improbable
,
which
he
can
invent
,
that
thou
wilt
not
support
.
<EOS>
Thou
art
ready
now
to
perjure
thyself
for
him
;
but
let
him
place
little
reliance
on
thee
,
for
thou
wilt
<EOS>
do
the
same
thing
for
us
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
""I
scarcely
think
it
probable
,
my
lady
,
"
Diego
replied
,
bowing
.
<EOS>
Lady
Lake
turned
from
him
in
supreme
disgust
.
"Admitting
<EOS>
for
a
moment
the
possibility
of
your
lordship
's
assertion
being
correct
,
"
said
Lady
Roos
,
"
how
comes
Gillian
Greenford
(
for
so
methinks
you
name
her
)
in
her
mistress
's
attire?""'T
is
easily
explained
,
chuck
,
"
Lord
Roos
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Anxious
,
no
doubt
,
to
set
herself
off
to
advantage
<EOS>
,
she
hath
made
free
with
the
countess
's
wardrobe
.
<EOS>
Your
own
favourite
attendant
,
Sarah
Swarton
,
hath
often
arranged
herself
in
your
finest
fardingales
,
kirtlets
,
and
busk
-
points
,
as
Diego
will
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
so
<EOS>
,
rascal?""'T
is
precisely
as
my
lord
hath
stated
,
my
lady
,
"
said
the
Spaniard
to
Lady
Roos
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
Sarah
Swarton
hath
been
so
habited
,
I
have
more
than
once
mistaken
her
for
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
""Yet
<EOS>
Sarah
is
very
unlike
me
,
"
said
Lady
Roos
.
<EOS>
"That
<EOS>
only
shows
how
deceptive
appearances
are
,
chuck
,
and
how
little
we
ought
to
trust
to
them
,
"
observed
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
can
you
suffer
yourself
to
be
thus
duped
,
Elizabeth
?
"
said
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"Because
<EOS>
her
ladyship
would
rather
believe
me
than
you
,
Madam
,
"
rejoined
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
"
But
she
is
not
duped
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
forgive
him
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Diego
,
aside
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
supposing
it
were
Gillian
<EOS>
,
how
would
the
case
be
mended
,
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
,
Elizabeth
?
"
said
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
not
as
much
injured
by
one
as
by
the
other?""It
may
be
,
"
replied
her
daughter
,
"
but
I
am
jealous
only
of
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
I
would
kneel
to
any
other
woman
,
and
thank
her
,
who
would
tear
my
husband
from
her
embraces!""Weak
fool
!
<EOS>
I
disown
you
,
"
exclaimed
Lady
Lake
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
a
wife
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Diego
,
apart
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
lordship
is
quite
unworthy
of
her
.
<EOS>
Now
I
should
appreciate
such
devotion
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
juncture
there
was
a
slight
movement
on
the
part
of
Lady
Exeter
,
and
something
like
a
sigh
escaped
her
.
<EOS>
"She
<EOS>
revives
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
Lady
Lake
to
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
soon
learn
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
will
find
a
means
to
make
her
speak
.
<EOS>
Well
,
my
lord
,
"
she
added
aloud
,
and
speaking
in
a
sarcastic
tone
,
"
if
you
will
have
it
so
,
it
is
idle
to
dispute
it
.
<EOS>
But
what
will
the
Countess
say
,
when
she
discovers
your
infidelity?"On
this
a
brisker
movement
took
place
on
the
couch
,
and
a
hand
was
raised
as
if
to
snatch
away
the
'
kerchief
.
"We
<EOS>
have
her
,
"
whispered
Lady
Lake
triumphantly
to
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Surely
,
"
she
proceeded
aloud
,
"
the
Countess
will
deeply
resent
the
transfer
of
your
affections
to
her
handmaiden
.
<EOS>
"Lord
<EOS>
Roos
saw
the
peril
in
which
he
stood
.
<EOS>
A
moment
more
and
Lady
Lake
had
gained
her
point
,
and
the
Countess
betrayed
herself
.
<EOS>
"Lady
<EOS>
Exeter
will
place
little
reliance
on
any
representations
you
may
make
,
Madam
,
"
he
said
,
giving
particular
significance
to
his
words
,
"
except
so
far
as
they
concern
herself
,
and
then
she
will
take
care
to
refute
them
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
circumstance
of
Gillian
Greenford
visiting
me
,
fainting
in
my
arms
(
from
excess
of
timidity
,
poor
girl
!
)
and
being
discovered
by
you
and
Lady
Roos
in
that
position
,
the
Countess
will
laugh
at
it
when
it
comes
to
her
knowledge
—
as
why
should
she
do
otherwise
?
<EOS>
But
she
will
feel
very
differently
when
she
finds
that
you
and
your
daughter
insist
that
it
was
she
herself
,
and
not
her
handmaiden
,
whom
you
beheld
.
<EOS>
Rely
on
it
,
Madam
,
Lady
Exeter
will
contradict
that
assertion
,
and
disprove
it
.
<EOS>
""Let
it
be
disproved
now
.
<EOS>
Let
the
person
on
that
couch
disclose
her
features
,
and
we
shall
then
see
whether
she
be
the
Countess
or
Gillian
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
let
her
do
that
,
my
lord,—let
<EOS>
her
speak
to
us
,
"
urged
Lady
Roos
.
<EOS>
"Diablo
!
<EOS>
how
is
this
request
to
be
complied
with
,
I
marvel
?
"
said
Diego
apart
.
<EOS>
But
Lord
Roos
was
too
experienced
a
player
to
be
defeated
by
this
turn
in
the
game
.
<EOS>
"Gillian
has
already
been
sufficiently
annoyed
,
"
he
cried
;
"
and
shall
not
submit
to
this
ordeal
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
she
has
relapsed
into
insensibility
,
as
you
see
.
<EOS>
""She
<EOS>
does
what
your
lordship
wills
her
,
it
is
clear
,
"
said
Lady
Lake
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
We
know
what
construction
to
put
upon
your
refusal
.
<EOS>
""I
care
not
what
construction
you
put
upon
it
,
"
cried
Lord
Roos
,
losing
patience
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
and
Lady
Roos
may
think
what
you
please
,
and
act
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
Enough
for
me
,
you
can
prove
nothing
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
,
this
is
more
like
yourself
,
my
lord
,
"
retorted
Lady
Lake
,
derisively
.
<EOS>
"
Having
thrown
aside
the
mask
,
you
will
be
spared
the
necessity
of
further
subterfuge
.
<EOS>
The
Countess
,
doubtless
,
will
imitate
your
example
,
lay
aside
her
feigned
insensibility
,
and
defy
us
.
<EOS>
She
need
be
under
no
apprehension
;
since
she
has
your
own
warrant
that
we
can
prove
nothing
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
purpose
,
I
perceive
,
is
to
irritate
me
,
Madam
,
"
cried
Lord
Roos
,
fiercely
;
"
and
so
far
you
are
likely
to
succeed
,
though
you
fail
in
all
else
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
mask
to
throw
off
;
but
if
you
will
have
me
declare
myself
your
enemy
,
I
am
ready
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Henceforth
,
let
there
be
no
terms
kept
between
us
—
let
it
be
open
warfare
.
<EOS>
""Be
it
<EOS>
so
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
And
you
will
soon
find
who
will
be
worsted
in
the
struggle
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
do
not
proceed
to
these
fearful
extremities
,
dear
mother
,
and
dearest
husband
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Lady
Roos
,
turning
from
one
to
the
other
imploringly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Cease
these
provocations
,
I
pray
of
you
.
<EOS>
Be
friends
,
and
not
enemies
.
<EOS>
""As
you
please
—
peace
or
war
<EOS>
;
it
is
the
same
to
me
,
"
said
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
"
Meantime
,
I
am
wearied
of
this
scene
,
and
must
put
an
end
to
it
.
<EOS>
Diego
!
"
<EOS>
And
beckoning
his
servant
to
him
,
he
whispered
some
directions
in
his
ear
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
lord
shall
be
obeyed
,
"
said
Diego
,
as
he
received
his
commission
.
<EOS>
"
Gillian
shall
be
conveyed
with
all
care
to
her
chamber
.
<EOS>
""We
must
have
some
proof
that
she
has
been
here
,
"
thought
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
But
how
to
obtain
it
?
<EOS>
I
have
it
.
<EOS>
"
Take
these
,
"
she
added
in
a
whisper
to
her
daughter
,
and
giving
a
pair
of
scissors
;
"
and
contrive
,
if
possible
,
to
sever
a
lock
of
her
hair
before
she
be
removed
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
a
look
Lady
Roos
promised
compliance
.
<EOS>
While
this
was
passing
,
Diego
had
approached
the
couch
;
and
fastening
the
kerchief
securely
round
the
Countess
's
face
,
he
raised
her
in
his
arms
,
and
moved
towards
the
secret
staircase
,
the
tapestried
covering
of
which
was
held
aside
by
Lord
Roos
to
give
him
passage
.
<EOS>
Rapidly
as
the
Spaniard
moved
,
he
did
not
outstrip
Lady
Roos
,
whose
design
being
favoured
by
the
escape
from
its
confinement
of
one
of
the
Countess
's
long
dark
tresses
,
she
had
no
difficulty
of
possessing
,
herself
of
it
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
her
mother
.
<EOS>
Lady
Exeter
was
aware
of
the
loss
she
had
sustained
,
and
uttered
a
stifled
cry
;
but
this
was
attributed
to
the
fright
natural
to
the
occasion
by
Lord
Roos
,
who
had
not
noticed
what
had
taken
place
,
and
only
caused
him
to
hurry
Diego
's
departure
.
<EOS>
But
before
the
latter
had
wholly
disappeared
with
his
burthen
,
the
perfumed
and
silken
tress
of
hair
was
delivered
to
Lady
Lake
,
who
muttered
triumphantly
as
she
received
it—"This
will
convict
her
.
<EOS>
She
can
not
escape
us
now
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
prize
was
scarcely
concealed
when
Lord
Roos
,
sheathing
the
sword
which
he
had
hitherto
held
drawn
,
advanced
towards
his
mother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
"Now
<EOS>
that
the
object
of
your
disquietude
is
removed
,
Madam
,
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
prolong
this
interview
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"Have
we
then
your
lordship
's
permission
to
depart
?
"
rejoined
Lady
Lake
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
not
,
I
presume
,
to
avail
ourselves
of
the
private
means
of
exit
contrived
for
your
amorous
adventures
,
lest
we
should
make
other
discoveries
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
ladyship
will
leave
by
the
way
you
entered
,
"
rejoined
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
attend
you
to
the
door
—
and
unfasten
it
for
you
.
<EOS>
""Before
<EOS>
we
go
,
I
would
have
a
word
with
my
husband
—
it
may
be
my
last
,
"
said
Lady
Roos
to
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
I
pray
you
withdraw
a
little
,
that
we
may
be
alone
.
<EOS>
""Better
<EOS>
not
,
"
rejoined
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
But
unable
to
resist
her
daughter
's
imploring
looks
,
she
added
,
"
Well
,
as
you
will
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
useless
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
she
proceeded
to
the
little
passage
,
and
remained
there
.
<EOS>
As
Lady
Roos
turned
to
her
husband
,
she
saw
,
from
the
stern
and
inflexible
look
he
had
assumed
,
that
any
appeal
made
to
him
would
be
unavailing
,
and
she
attempted
none
.
<EOS>
A
moment
elapsed
before
she
could
utter
a
word
,
and
then
it
was
only
a
murmur
to
heaven
for
guidance
and
support
.
<EOS>
"What
say
you
,
Elizabeth
?
"
demanded
Lord
Roos
,
thinking
she
had
addressed
him
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
asked
for
support
from
on
High
,
William
,
and
it
has
been
accorded
to
me
,
"
she
replied
in
a
low
sweet
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
now
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
to
weary
you
with
supplications
or
reproaches
that
I
thus
detain
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
something
to
impart
to
you
,
and
I
am
sure
you
will
eagerly
listen
to
it
.
<EOS>
Come
nearer
,
that
we
may
not
be
overheard
.
<EOS>
"Lord
Roos
,
whose
curiosity
was
aroused
by
her
manner
,
obeyed
her
.
<EOS>
"I
am
all
attention
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"I
feel
I
am
in
your
way
<EOS>
,
William
,
"
she
rejoined
,
in
a
deep
whisper
;
"
and
that
you
desire
my
death
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
interrupt
me
not
;
I
am
sure
you
desire
it
;
and
I
am
equally
sure
that
the
desire
will
be
gratified
,
and
that
you
will
kill
me
.
<EOS>
""Kill
you
,
Bess
!
"
cried
Lord
Roos
,
startled
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
imagine
aught
so
frightful?""There
is
a
power
granted
to
those
who
love
deeply
as
I
do
,
of
seeing
into
the
hearts
of
those
they
love
,
and
reading
their
secrets
.
<EOS>
I
have
read
yours
,
William
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
be
not
alarmed
.
<EOS>
I
have
kept
it
to
myself
hitherto
,
and
will
keep
it
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
You
wish
me
dead
,
I
say
;
and
you
shall
have
your
wish
—
but
not
in
the
way
you
propose
.
<EOS>
Having
lost
your
love
,
I
am
become
indifferent
to
life
—
or
,
rather
,
life
is
grown
intolerable
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
though
death
may
be
a
release
,
it
must
not
come
from
your
hand
.
<EOS>
""You
can
not
mean
to
destroy
yourself
,
Elizabeth
?
"
cried
Lord
Roos
,
appalled
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
mean
to
trouble
you
no
longer
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
make
the
last
and
greatest
sacrifice
I
can
for
you
;
and
to
save
you
from
a
crime
—
or
,
if
you
must
share
the
crime
,
at
least
to
screen
you
from
punishment
.
<EOS>
Look
,
here
!
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
producing
a
small
phial
.
<EOS>
"
Bid
me
drink
of
this
,
and
ere
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
you
are
free
,
and
I
am
at
rest
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
do
it?""No
—
no
,
"
rejoined
Lord
Roos
,
snatching
the
phial
from
her
.
"
<EOS>
Live
,
Bess
,
live!""Am
<EOS>
I
to
live
for
you
,
William
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
with
inexpressible
joy
.
<EOS>
He
made
no
answer
,
but
averted
his
head
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
mercy
give
me
back
the
phial
,
"
she
exclaimed
,
again
plunged
into
the
depths
of
despair
.
<EOS>
"I
must
refuse
your
request
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
you
done
,
Elizabeth
?
"
demanded
Lady
Lake
,
coming
forth
from
the
passage
.
<EOS>
"A
moment
more
,
mother
,
"
cried
Lady
Roos
.
<EOS>
"
One
word
—
one
look
!
"
<EOS>
she
added
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
But
he
neither
spoke
to
her
,
nor
regarded
her
.
<EOS>
"I
am
ready
to
accompany
you
now
,
mother
,
"
said
the
poor
lady
faintly
.
<EOS>
"Nerve
<EOS>
yourself
,
weak
-
hearted
girl
,
"
said
Lady
Lake
,
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
"
Revenge
is
ours
.
<EOS>
""If
I
could
only
strike
her
without
injuring
him
,
I
should
not
heed
,
"
thought
Lady
Roos
.
<EOS>
"
But
where
he
suffers
,
I
must
also
suffer
,
and
yet
more
acutely
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
scarcely
able
to
support
herself
,
she
followed
her
mother
to
the
door
of
the
ante
-
chamber
,
which
was
unlocked
,
and
thrown
open
for
them
by
her
husband
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
bid
her
farewell!As
Lady
Lake
passed
forth
,
she
paused
for
a
moment
,
and
said—"To
-
morrow
,
my
Lord
,
we
will
ascertain
whether
the
tress
of
hair
we
have
obtained
from
the
fair
visitant
to
your
chamber
,
matches
with
that
of
Gillian
Greenford
or
with
the
raven
locks
of
the
Countess
of
Exeter
.
"And
<EOS>
satisfied
with
the
effect
produced
by
this
menace
,
she
departed
with
her
daughter
,
before
Lord
Roos
could
utter
a
reply
.

CHAPTER
XXIV.The
Fountain
Court
.
<EOS>
On
the
morning
after
the
eventful
passage
in
his
life
,
previously
related
,
our
newly
-
created
knight
was
standing
,
in
a
pensive
attitude
,
beside
the
beautiful
fountain
,
adorned
with
two
fair
statues
,
representing
the
Queen
of
Love
and
her
son
,
heretofore
described
as
placed
in
the
centre
of
the
great
quadrangle
of
the
Palace
of
Theobalds
.
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
was
listening
to
the
plashing
of
the
sparkling
jets
of
water
,
as
they
rose
into
the
air
,
and
fell
back
into
the
broad
marble
basin
,
and
appeared
to
be
soothed
by
the
pleasant
sound
.
<EOS>
His
breast
had
been
agitated
by
various
and
conflicting
emotions
.
<EOS>
In
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
events
had
occurred
,
some
of
which
seemed
likely
to
influence
the
whole
of
his
future
career
;
while
one
of
them
,
though
it
had
advanced
him
far
beyond
what
he
could
have
anticipated
,
appeared
likely
to
mar
altogether
his
prospects
of
happiness
.
<EOS>
Though
the
difficulties
,
therefore
,
that
surrounded
him
had
been
unexpectedly
overcome
;
though
,
by
the
exertions
of
the
Conde
de
Gondomar
,
who
had
followed
up
his
first
success
with
wonderful
promptitude
and
perseverance
,
and
had
dexterously
contrived
,
by
all
the
insidious
arts
of
which
lie
was
so
perfect
a
master
,
to
ingratiate
his
protegé
still
further
with
the
King
,
without
the
protegé
himself
being
aware
of
the
manner
in
which
he
was
served
;
though
James
himself
appeared
greatly
pleased
with
him
,
at
the
banquet
in
the
evening
,
to
which
,
owing
to
the
skilful
management
of
the
Spanish
ambassador
,
he
was
invited
,
and
bestowed
such
marked
attention
upon
him
,
that
the
envy
and
jealousy
of
most
of
the
courtiers
were
excited
by
it
;
though
he
seemed
on
the
high
-
road
to
still
greater
favour
,
and
was
already
looked
upon
as
a
rising
favourite
,
who
might
speedily
supplant
others
above
him
in
this
ever
-
changing
sphere
,
if
he
did
not
receive
a
check
;
though
his
present
position
was
thus
comparatively
secure
,
and
his
prospects
thus
brilliant
,
he
felt
ill
at
ease
,
and
deeply
dissatisfied
with
himself
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
acquit
himself
of
blame
for
the
part
he
had
played
,
though
involuntarily
,
in
the
arrest
of
Hugh
Calveley
.
<EOS>
It
was
inexpressibly
painful
to
him
;
and
he
felt
it
as
a
reproach
from
which
he
could
not
free
himself
,
to
have
risen
,
however
unexpectedly
on
his
own
part
,
by
the
unfortunate
Puritan
's
fall
.
<EOS>
How
could
he
ever
face
Aveline
again
!
<EOS>
She
must
regard
him
with
horror
and
detestation
,
as
the
involuntary
cause
of
her
father
's
destruction
.
<EOS>
A
bar
had
been
placed
between
them
,
which
nothing
could
ever
remove
.
<EOS>
And
though
,
on
the
one
hand
,
he
was
suddenly
exalted
far
beyond
his
hopes
;
yet
on
the
other
he
was
as
suddenly
cast
down
,
and
threatened
to
be
for
ever
deprived
of
the
bliss
he
had
in
view
,
the
possession
of
which
he
coveted
far
more
than
wealth
or
grandeur
.
<EOS>
Additional
complexity
had
been
given
to
his
position
from
the
circumstance
that
,
at
De
Gondomar
's
secret
instance
,
of
which
,
like
all
the
rest
,
he
was
unaware
,
he
had
been
appointed
as
officer
in
custody
of
Hugh
Calveley
,
until
the
latter
,
who
was
still
detained
a
close
prisoner
in
the
porter
's
lodge
,
should
be
removed
to
the
Tower
,
or
the
Fleet
,
as
his
Majesty
might
direct
.
<EOS>
This
post
he
would
have
declined
,
had
there
been
a
possibility
of
doing
so
.
<EOS>
Any
plan
he
might
have
formed
of
aiding
the
prisoner
's
escape
was
thus
effectually
prevented
,
as
he
could
not
violate
his
duty
;
and
it
was
probably
with
this
view
that
the
wily
ambassador
had
obtained
him
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
he
had
unconsciously
become
little
more
than
a
puppet
in
the
hands
of
the
plotting
Spaniard
,
who
pulled
the
strings
that
moved
him
at
pleasure
,
regardless
of
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
What
De
Gondomar
's
ulterior
designs
were
with
him
had
not
yet
become
manifest
.
<EOS>
These
perplexing
thoughts
swept
through
Sir
Jocelyn
's
breast
,
as
he
stood
by
the
marble
fountain
,
and
listened
to
the
sound
of
its
falling
waters
.
<EOS>
While
thus
occupied
,
he
perceived
two
persons
issue
from
the
arched
entrance
fronting
the
gate
(
adjoining
the
porter
's
lodge
,
in
which
the
prisoner
was
still
detained
)
,
and
make
their
way
slowly
across
the
quadrangle
,
in
the
direction
of
the
cloister
on
its
eastern
side
,
above
which
were
apartments
assigned
to
the
Secretary
of
State
,
Sir
Thomas
Lake
.
<EOS>
The
foremost
of
the
two
was
merely
a
yeoman
of
the
guard
,
and
would
not
for
a
moment
have
attracted
Sir
Jocelyn
's
attention
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
female
who
accompanied
him
,
and
whom
he
was
evidently
conducting
to
Sir
Thomas
Lake
's
rooms
,
as
Sir
Jocelyn
not
only
saw
the
man
point
towards
them
,
but
heard
him
mention
the
Secretary
of
State
's
name
.
<EOS>
Something
whispered
him
that
this
closely
-
hooded
female,—the
lower
part
of
whose
face
was
shrouded
in
a
muffler
,
so
that
the
eyes
alone
were
visible,—was
Aveline
.
<EOS>
Little
could
be
discerned
of
the
features
;
but
the
exquisitely
-
proportioned
figure
,
so
simply
yet
so
tastefully
arrayed
,
could
only
be
hers
;
and
if
he
could
have
doubted
that
it
was
Aveline
,
the
suddenness
with
which
her
looks
were
averted
as
she
beheld
him
,
and
the
quickness
with
which
she
stepped
forward
,
so
as
even
to
outstrip
her
companion
—
these
circumstances
,
coupled
with
the
violent
throbbing
of
his
own
heart
,
convinced
him
he
was
right
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
flown
after
her
,
if
he
had
dared
;
would
have
poured
forth
all
his
passionate
feelings
to
her
,
had
he
been
permitted
;
would
have
offered
her
his
life
,
to
deal
with
as
she
pleased
;
but
his
fears
restrained
him
,
and
he
remained
riveted
to
the
spot
,
gazing
after
her
until
she
entered
the
great
hall
on
the
ground
floor
,
beneath
the
Secretary
of
State
's
apartments
.
<EOS>
Why
she
sought
Sir
Thomas
Lake
he
could
easily
understand
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
from
him
that
authority
to
visit
her
father
could
be
obtained
.
<EOS>
After
remaining
irresolute
for
a
few
minutes
,
during
which
the
magnificent
structure
around
him
faded
entirely
from
his
view
like
a
vision
melting
into
air
,
and
he
heard
no
more
the
pleasant
plashing
of
the
fountain
,
he
proceeded
to
the
great
hall
near
the
cloister
,
resolved
to
wait
there
till
her
return
.

CHAPTER
XXV.Sir
Thomas
Lake
.
<EOS>
A
grave
-
looking
man
,
of
a
melancholy
and
severe
aspect
,
and
attired
in
a
loose
robe
of
black
velvet
,
was
seated
alone
in
a
chamber
,
the
windows
of
which
opened
upon
the
Fountain
Court
,
which
we
have
just
quitted
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
silken
skull
-
cap
,
from
beneath
which
a
few
gray
hairs
escaped
;
his
brow
was
furrowed
with
innumerable
wrinkles
,
occasioned
as
much
by
thought
and
care
as
by
age
;
his
pointed
beard
and
moustaches
were
almost
white
,
contrasting
strikingly
with
his
dark
,
jaundiced
complexion
,
the
result
of
an
atrabilarious
temperament
;
his
person
was
extremely
attenuated
,
and
his
hands
thin
and
bony
.
<EOS>
He
had
once
been
tall
,
but
latterly
had
lost
much
of
his
height
,
in
consequence
of
a
curvature
of
the
spine
,
which
bowed
down
his
head
almost
upon
his
breast
,
and
fixed
it
immoveably
in
that
position
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
good
,
but
,
as
we
have
stated
,
were
stamped
with
melancholy
,
and
sharpened
by
severity
.
<EOS>
This
person
was
Sir
Thomas
Lake
,
Secretary
of
State
.
<EOS>
The
table
at
which
he
sat
was
strewn
over
with
official
documents
and
papers
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
,
however
,
examining
any
of
them
,
but
had
just
broken
the
seal
of
a
private
packet
which
he
had
received
from
his
wife
,
when
an
usher
entered
,
and
intimated
that
a
young
maiden
,
who
was
without
,
solicited
a
moment
's
audience
.
<EOS>
The
request
would
have
been
refused
,
if
the
man
had
not
gone
on
to
say
that
he
believed
the
applicant
was
the
daughter
of
the
crazy
Puritan
,
who
had
threatened
the
King
's
life
on
the
previous
day
.
<EOS>
On
hearing
this
,
Sir
Thomas
consented
to
see
her
,
and
she
was
admitted
accordingly
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
usher
had
retired
,
Aveline
unmuffled
herself
,
and
,
cold
and
apathetic
as
he
was
,
Sir
Thomas
could
not
help
being
struck
by
her
surpassing
beauty
,
unimpaired
even
by
the
affliction
under
which
she
laboured
;
and
he
consequently
softened
in
some
degree
the
customary
asperity
of
his
tones
in
addressing
her
.
"Who
<EOS>
are
you
,
maiden
,
and
what
seek
you
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
demanded
,
eyeing
her
with
curiosity
.
<EOS>
"I
am
daughter
to
the
unfortunate
Hugh
Calveley
,
now
a
prisoner
in
the
palace
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"I
am
sorry
to
hear
it
<EOS>
,
"
rejoined
Sir
Thomas
,
resuming
his
habitually
severe
expression
;
"
for
you
are
the
daughter
of
a
very
heinous
offender
.
<EOS>
The
enormity
of
Hugh
Calveley
's
crime
,
which
is
worse
than
parricide
,
deprives
him
of
all
human
sympathy
and
compassion
.
<EOS>
In
coming
to
me
you
do
not
,
I
presume
,
intend
to
weary
me
with
prayers
for
mercy
;
for
none
is
deserved
,
and
none
will
be
shown
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
shall
not
utter
a
word
in
mitigation
of
the
dreadful
sentence
certain
to
be
pronounced
upon
him
;
nor
shall
I
advise
the
slightest
clemency
to
be
shown
him
on
the
part
of
his
Majesty
.
<EOS>
Such
an
offender
can
not
be
too
severely
punished
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
this
,
"
he
continued
,
somewhat
softening
his
harshness
,
"
to
aggravate
the
distress
and
shame
you
naturally
feel
;
but
I
wish
to
check
at
once
any
hopes
you
may
have
formed
.
<EOS>
Yet
though
I
have
no
pity
for
him
,
I
have
much
for
you
,
since
,
doubtless
,
you
are
innocent
of
all
knowledge
of
your
father
's
atrocious
design
—
happily
prevented
.
<EOS>
And
I
would
therefore
say
to
you
,
shut
out
all
feelings
for
him
from
your
heart
.
<EOS>
The
man
who
raises
his
hand
against
his
sovereign
cuts
off
by
the
act
all
ties
of
kindred
and
love
.
<EOS>
Affection
is
changed
to
abhorrence
;
and
such
detestation
does
his
horrible
offence
inspire
,
that
those
of
his
own
blood
are
bound
to
shun
him
,
lest
he
derive
comfort
and
consolation
from
their
presence
.
<EOS>
Thus
considered
,
you
are
no
longer
his
daughter
,
for
he
has
himself
severed
the
links
between
you
.
<EOS>
You
no
longer
owe
him
filial
duty
and
regard
,
for
to
such
he
is
no
more
entitled
.
<EOS>
Leave
him
to
his
fate
;
and
,
if
possible
,
for
ever
obliterate
his
memory
from
your
breast
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
counsel
what
I
can
never
perform
,
honourable
Sir
,
"
replied
Aveline
;
"
and
were
he
even
branded
like
Cain
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
shut
my
heart
towards
him
.
<EOS>
Nothing
can
make
me
forget
that
I
am
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
That
his
offence
will
be
dreadfully
expiated
,
I
do
not
doubt
;
but
if
I
can
alleviate
his
sufferings
in
any
way
,
I
will
do
so
;
and
I
will
never
cease
to
plead
for
mercy
for
him
.
<EOS>
And
O
,
honourable
Sir
!
<EOS>
you
regard
his
offence
in
a
darker
light
than
it
deserves
.
<EOS>
You
treat
him
as
if
he
had
actually
accomplished
the
direful
purpose
attributed
to
him
;
whereas
,
nothing
has
been
proven
against
him
beyond
the
possession
of
a
weapon
,
which
he
might
keep
about
his
person
for
self
-
defence
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
plea
you
urge
is
futile
,
maiden
,
"
rejoined
Sir
Thomas
;
"
he
is
judged
out
of
his
own
mouth
,
for
his
own
lips
have
avowed
his
criminal
intention
.
<EOS>
""Still
,
it
was
but
<EOS>
the
intention
,
honourable
Sir!""In
such
cases
,
the
intention
is
equal
to
the
crime
—
at
least
in
the
eyes
of
law
and
justice
.
<EOS>
No
plea
will
save
Hugh
Calveley
.
<EOS>
Of
that
rest
assured
.
<EOS>
""One
<EOS>
plea
may
be
urged
for
him
,
which
,
whether
it
avail
or
not
,
is
the
truth
,
and
shall
be
made
.
<EOS>
It
is
painful
to
speak
of
my
father
as
I
must
now
do
;
but
there
is
no
help
for
it
.
<EOS>
Of
late
years
he
has
been
subject
to
strange
mental
hallucinations
,
which
have
bordered
close
upon
madness
,
if
they
have
not
reached
that
terrible
point
.
<EOS>
Nocturnal
vigils
,
fastings
,
and
prayers
have
affected
his
health
.
<EOS>
He
has
denied
himself
sufficient
rest
,
and
has
only
partaken
of
food
barely
sufficient
to
sustain
nature
,
and
no
more
.
<EOS>
The
consequence
has
been
that
strange
fancies
have
troubled
his
brain
;
that
at
dead
of
night
,
when
alone
in
his
chamber
,
he
has
imagined
that
visions
have
appeared
to
him
;
that
voices
have
spoken
—
awful
voices
—
talking
of
prophecies
,
lamentations
,
and
judgments
,
and
charging
him
with
a
mighty
and
terrible
mission
.
<EOS>
All
these
things
I
have
heard
from
his
own
lips
,
and
I
have
heard
and
seen
much
more
,
which
has
satisfied
me
that
his
intellects
are
disordered
,
and
that
he
can
not
be
held
accountable
for
his
actions
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
such
be
the
case
,
he
should
have
been
kept
under
restraint
,
and
not
suffered
to
go
abroad
,
"
said
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
"
Such
madmen
are
highly
mischievous
and
dangerous
.
<EOS>
Much
blame
rests
with
you
,
maiden
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
whole
blame
is
mine
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
I
confess
my
error
—
my
crime
—
and
will
atone
for
it
willingly
with
my
life
,
provided
he
be
spared
.
<EOS>
If
a
sacrifice
must
be
made
,
let
me
be
the
victim
.
<EOS>
""There
is
no
sacrifice
,
and
no
victim
,
"
returned
Sir
Thomas
gravely
,
though
he
was
not
unmoved
by
her
filial
devotion
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
an
offender
,
and
there
will
be
justice
;
and
justice
must
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
Inexorable
as
fate
,
her
dread
sentences
can
not
be
averted
.
<EOS>
""O
,
honourable
Sir
!
<EOS>
you
may
one
day
recall
those
words
;
for
which
of
us
can
hold
himself
free
from
offence
?
<EOS>
My
father
is
not
guilty
in
the
eyes
of
Heaven
;
or
if
he
be
,
I
am
equally
culpable
,
since
I
ought
to
have
prevented
the
commission
of
the
crime
.
<EOS>
O
,
I
shall
never
forgive
myself
that
I
did
not
follow
him
when
he
parted
from
me
yesterday!""Let
<EOS>
me
hear
how
that
occurred
,
maiden
?
"
asked
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
chanced
in
this
way
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
described
my
father
's
state
of
mind
,
and
the
distempered
view
he
has
been
accustomed
to
take
of
all
things
.
<EOS>
Yesterday
,
May
-
day
sports
were
held
in
the
village
of
Tottenham
,
where
we
dwelt
;
and
as
such
things
are
an
abomination
in
his
sight
,
he
took
upon
him
to
reprove
the
actors
in
the
pastimes
.
<EOS>
They
who
witnessed
his
conduct
on
that
occasion
would
hardly
hold
him
to
be
under
the
due
control
of
reason
.
<EOS>
Amongst
the
spectators
was
the
son
of
an
old
friend
,
whose
name
having
accidentally
reached
my
father
,
he
invited
him
into
the
house
,
and
a
misunderstanding
having
arisen
between
them
,
the
latter
suddenly
left
—
dismissed
almost
with
rudeness
.
<EOS>
On
his
departure
,
my
father
was
greatly
disturbed
—
more
so
than
I
have
ever
seen
him
.
<EOS>
After
awhile
,
he
withdrew
to
his
own
chamber
,
as
was
his
habit
,
to
pray
,
and
I
hoped
would
become
tranquillized
;
but
the
very
reverse
happened
,
for
when
he
reappeared
<EOS>
,
I
saw
at
once
that
a
fearful
change
had
taken
place
in
him
.
<EOS>
His
eye
blazed
with
preternatural
light
,
his
gestures
were
wild
and
alarming
,
and
his
language
full
of
menace
and
denunciation
.
<EOS>
He
again
spoke
of
his
mission
from
Heaven
,
and
said
that
its
execution
could
no
longer
be
delayed
.
<EOS>
""This
should
have
been
a
warning
to
you
,
"
observed
Sir
Thomas
,
knitting
his
brows
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
should
,
honourable
Sir
.
<EOS>
But
I
did
not
profit
by
it
.
<EOS>
I
knew
and
felt
that
he
was
no
longer
under
the
dominion
of
reason
—
that
he
was
labouring
under
some
terrible
delusion
that
approached
its
crisis
;
but
I
did
not
check
him
.
<EOS>
I
yielded
passive
obedience
to
his
injunction
,
that
I
should
depart
instantly
with
an
old
servant
to
London
;
and
I
agreed
to
tarry
at
a
house
,
which
he
mentioned
,
till
I
heard
from
him
.
<EOS>
I
had
sad
forebodings
that
I
should
never
hear
from
him
again
—
or
if
I
did
,
that
the
tidings
would
be
worse
than
none
at
all
;
but
I
obeyed
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
,
indeed
,
resist
his
will
.
<EOS>
I
set
forth
with
my
attendant
,
and
my
father
parted
with
us
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
placed
money
in
my
hand
,
and
bade
me
farewell
!
<EOS>
but
in
such
a
tone
,
and
with
such
a
look
,
that
I
felt
his
senses
were
gone
,
and
I
would
have
stayed
him
,
but
it
was
then
too
late
.
<EOS>
Breaking
from
my
embrace
,
he
sprang
upon
his
horse
,
which
was
ready
saddled
,
and
rode
off
,
taking
the
direction
of
Edmonton
;
while
I
,
with
a
heart
full
of
distress
and
misgiving
,
pursued
my
way
to
London
.
<EOS>
Ere
midnight
,
my
sad
presentiments
were
verified
.
<EOS>
A
messenger
traced
me
out
,
bringing
intelligence
of
the
direful
event
that
had
happened
,
and
informing
me
that
my
father
was
a
prisoner
at
Theobalds
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
could
procure
means
of
reaching
the
palace
,
I
set
forth
,
and
arrived
here
about
an
hour
ago
,
when
,
failing
in
my
efforts
to
obtain
an
interview
with
my
father
,
who
is
closely
confined
,
and
none
suffered
to
come
near
him
save
with
authority
from
the
Secretary
of
State
<EOS>
,
I
sought
an
audience
of
you
,
honourable
Sir
,
in
the
hope
that
you
would
grant
me
permission
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
I
do
grant
it
,
the
interview
must
take
place
in
the
presence
of
the
officer
to
whom
his
custody
has
been
committed
,
"
replied
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
"
With
this
restriction
,
I
am
willing
to
sign
an
order
for
you
.
<EOS>
""Be
it
as
you
please
,
honourable
Sir
;
and
take
my
heartfelt
gratitude
for
the
grace
.
"Sir
<EOS>
Thomas
struck
a
small
bell
upon
the
table
,
and
the
usher
appeared
at
the
summons
.
<EOS>
"Bid
<EOS>
the
officer
in
charge
of
Hugh
Calveley
attend
me
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
The
man
bowed
,
and
departed
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Lake
then
turned
to
the
paper
which
he
had
just
opened
before
Aveline
's
appearance
,
and
was
soon
so
much
engrossed
by
it
that
he
seemed
quite
unconscious
of
her
presence
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
became
gloomier
and
more
austere
as
he
read
on
,
and
an
expression
of
pain
—
almost
a
groan
—
escaped
him
.
<EOS>
He
appeared
then
to
feel
sensible
that
he
had
committed
an
indiscretion
,
for
he
laid
down
the
paper
,
and
,
as
if
forcibly
diverting
himself
from
its
contents
,
addressed
Aveline
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
you
have
said
respecting
your
father
's
condition
of
mind
,
"
he
observed
,
"
by
no
means
convinces
me
that
it
is
so
unsound
as
to
render
him
irresponsible
for
his
actions
.
<EOS>
It
were
to
put
a
charitable
construction
upon
his
conduct
to
say
that
no
one
but
a
madman
could
be
capable
of
it
;
but
there
was
too
much
consistency
in
what
he
has
said
and
done
to
admit
of
such
an
inference
.
<EOS>
But
for
the
interposition
of
another
person
he
owned
that
he
would
have
killed
the
King
;
and
the
disappointment
he
exhibited
,
and
the
language
he
used
,
prove
such
to
have
been
his
fixed
intention
.
<EOS>
His
mind
may
have
been
disturbed
;
but
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
All
who
meditate
great
crimes
,
it
is
to
be
hoped
,
are
not
entirely
masters
of
themselves
.
<EOS>
Yet
for
that
reason
they
are
not
to
be
exempt
from
punishment
.
<EOS>
He
who
is
sane
enough
to
conceive
an
act
of
wickedness
,
to
plan
its
execution
,
and
to
attempt
to
perpetrate
it
,
although
he
may
be
in
other
respects
of
unsettled
mind
,
is
equally
amenable
to
the
law
,
and
ought
equally
to
suffer
for
his
criminality
with
him
who
has
a
wiser
and
sounder
head
upon
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
"Aveline
<EOS>
attempted
no
reply
,
but
the
tears
sprang
to
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
the
door
was
thrown
open
by
the
usher
to
admit
Sir
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
.
<EOS>
The
emotion
displayed
by
the
young
couple
when
thus
brought
together
passed
unnoticed
by
the
Secretary
of
State
,
as
he
was
occupied
at
the
moment
in
writing
the
authority
for
Aveline
,
and
did
not
raise
his
eyes
towards
them
.
<EOS>
"Are
<EOS>
you
the
officer
to
whom
my
father
's
custody
has
been
entrusted
?
"
exclaimed
Aveline
,
as
soon
as
she
could
give
utterance
to
her
surprise
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
do
you
ask
that
question
,
mistress
?
"
demanded
Sir
Thomas
,
looking
up
.
<EOS>
"
What
can
it
signify
to
you
who
hath
custody
of
your
father
,
provided
good
care
be
taken
of
him
?
<EOS>
There
is
a
Latin
maxim
which
his
Majesty
cited
at
the
banquet
last
night
—
<EOS>
Etiam
aconito
inest
remedium
—
and
which
may
be
freely
rendered
by
our
homely
saying
,
that
'
It
is
an
ill
wind
that
bloweth
nobody
good
luck
;
'
and
this
hath
proved
true
with
Sir
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
—
for
the
gust
that
hath
wrecked
your
father
hath
driven
him
into
port
,
where
he
now
rides
securely
in
the
sunshine
of
the
King
's
favour
.
<EOS>
Nor
is
this
to
be
wondered
at
,
since
it
was
by
Sir
Jocelyn
that
his
Majesty
's
life
was
preserved
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
King
preserved
by
him
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Aveline
,
in
bewilderment
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
marry
and
indeed
,
young
mistress
,
"
rejoined
Sir
Thomas
.
"
<EOS>
He
arrested
the
fell
traitor
;
was
knighted
on
the
spot
for
the
service
,
by
the
King
;
was
invited
afterwards
to
the
grand
banquet
in
the
evening
,
and
received
with
more
distinction
than
any
other
guest
;
and
he
is
now
,
as
you
find
,
entrusted
with
the
custody
of
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
if
your
father
has
done
little
good
to
himself
,
he
hath
done
much
to
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"Aveline
<EOS>
could
not
repress
an
exclamation
of
anguish
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
more
of
this
,
I
entreat
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
cried
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"It
is
right
she
should
hear
the
truth
,
"
replied
the
Secretary
of
State
.
<EOS>
"
Here
is
her
authority
for
admittance
to
her
father
,
"
he
continued
,
giving
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
take
place
in
your
presence
,
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
And
you
will
pay
strict
attention
to
what
they
say
,
"
he
added
in
a
low
tone
,
"
for
you
will
have
to
report
all
that
passes
between
them
to
the
council
.
<EOS>
Something
may
arise
to
implicate
the
girl
herself
,
so
let
naught
escape
you
.
<EOS>
Be
vigilant
in
your
office
,
as
is
needful
.
<EOS>
I
mention
this
as
you
are
new
to
it
.
<EOS>
If
the
prisoner
continues
obstinate
,
as
he
hath
hitherto
shown
himself
,
threaten
him
with
the
torture
.
<EOS>
The
rack
will
certainly
be
applied
when
he
reaches
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
give
you
further
instructions
I
think
,
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
Be
pleased
to
return
to
me
when
the
interview
is
over
.
<EOS>
"Upon
this
<EOS>
,
he
bowed
gravely
,
and
sounded
the
bell
for
the
usher
.
<EOS>
Unable
to
offer
any
remonstrance
,
Sir
Jocelyn
approached
Aveline
,
who
could
scarcely
support
herself
,
with
the
intention
of
offering
her
assistance
;
but
she
shrank
from
him
,
and
again
muffling
her
face
,
went
forth
,
while
he
slowly
followed
her
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
XXVI.The
Forged
Confession
.
<EOS>
Some
little
time
had
elapsed
since
Aveline
's
departure
on
her
sorrowful
errand
,
and
Sir
Thomas
Lake
was
still
alone
,
and
once
more
deeply
engrossed
in
the
consideration
of
the
document
,
which
,
it
will
be
recollected
,
had
occasioned
him
so
much
disquietude
;
and
the
feeling
by
no
means
diminished
when
the
usher
entered
and
announced
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
Severe
and
inflexible
as
we
have
described
him
,
the
Secretary
of
State
was
generally
yielding
enough
towards
his
lady
,
of
whom
he
stood
in
great
awe
,
and
whom
he
treated
with
the
utmost
deference
;
but
on
this
occasion
,
contrary
to
habitude
,
he
received
her
very
coldly
,
and
without
rising
motioned
her
to
a
seat
beside
him
.
<EOS>
Disregarding
the
want
of
attention
,
which
,
under
other
circumstances
,
she
would
have
resented
,
Lady
Lake
took
the
seat
indicated
without
remark
,
and
continued
silent
till
the
usher
had
retired
.
<EOS>
Then
turning
quickly
towards
her
husband
,
and
fixing
an
inquiring
look
upon
him
,
she
said
in
a
low
voice—"What
think
you
of
this
document
,
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas?""This
forgery
?
<EOS>
"
he
rejoined
in
the
same
tone
,
but
without
raising
his
eyes
towards
her
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
this
forgery
,
if
you
choose
to
call
it
so
,
"
she
returned
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
have
your
opinion
upon
it
?
<EOS>
Is
it
as
it
should
be
?
<EOS>
Are
its
expressions
such
as
would
be
used
by
a
guilty
woman
,
like
the
Countess
,
imploring
pity
,
and
seeking
to
shield
herself
from
disgrace
?
<EOS>
Do
you
find
fault
with
it
?
<EOS>
Can
it
be
amended
in
any
particular?""I
find
such
grave
fault
with
it
,
"
replied
the
Secretary
of
State
,
still
without
looking
up
,
"
that
I
would
amend
it
by
casting
it
into
the
flames
.
<EOS>
Lady
Lake
,
it
is
my
duty
to
warn
you
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
fearful
crime
you
would
commit
,
and
severely
punishable
by
the
law
.
<EOS>
You
may
excuse
it
to
yourself
,
because
you
have
an
end
in
view
which
seems
to
justify
the
means
;
but
the
excuse
will
not
avail
you
with
others
.
<EOS>
You
have
said
that
in
a
conflict
with
one
so
cunning
and
unscrupulous
as
our
noble
son
-
in
-
law
,
you
are
compelled
to
fight
him
with
his
own
weapons
—
to
meet
trick
with
trick
,
manoevre
with
manoeuvre
;
but
take
my
word
for
it
,
you
would
more
easily
defeat
him
by
straight
-
forward
means
.
<EOS>
Be
ruled
by
me
in
this
one
instance
.
<EOS>
Abandon
a
scheme
which
must
inevitably
lead
to
consequences
I
shudder
to
contemplate
;
and
let
this
fabricated
confession
be
destroyed
.
<EOS>
""Give
it
<EOS>
me
,
"
she
cried
,
snatching
the
paper
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
were
ever
timid
,
Sir
Thomas
;
and
if
you
had
not
lacked
courage
,
this
expedient
would
not
have
been
necessary
.
<EOS>
Odious
and
dangerous
as
it
is
,
the
measure
is
forced
upon
me
,
and
I
shall
not
shrink
from
it
.
<EOS>
But
you
shall
not
be
called
upon
to
play
any
part
in
the
transaction
.
<EOS>
I
alone
will
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
alone
will
be
responsible
for
all
that
may
ensue
.
<EOS>
""We
shall
all
be
responsible
!
"
<EOS>
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
only
ruin
yourself
,
but
all
your
family
,
if
this
fearful
step
be
taken
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
we
have
had
right
on
our
side
,
but
henceforth
we
shall
be
more
culpable
than
the
others
.
<EOS>
""I
am
resolved
upon
the
course
,
"
cried
Lady
Lake
;
"
and
all
your
arguments
—
all
your
warnings
will
not
dissuade
me
from
it
,
<EOS>
so
you
may
spare
your
breath
,
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
As
you
see
,
I
have
omitted
the
charge
of
witchcraft
,
and
have
only
made
the
Countess
confess
her
criminality
with
Lord
Roos
,
and
of
this
we
have
had
abundant
proofs
;
<EOS>
nay
,
we
should
have
them
still
,
if
those
condemnatory
letters
of
hers
,
which
had
come
into
our
possession
,
had
not
been
stolen
.
<EOS>
That
mischance
necessitates
the
present
measure
.
<EOS>
Having
managed
to
deprive
us
of
our
weapons
,
Lord
Roos
thinks
himself
secure
.
<EOS>
But
he
will
find
his
mistake
when
this
document
is
produced
to
confound
him
.
<EOS>
""I
tremble
at
the
thought
,
"
groaned
the
Secretary
of
State
.
<EOS>
"These
<EOS>
fears
are
worse
than
womanish
,
"
exclaimed
his
lady
.
"
<EOS>
Shake
them
off
,
and
be
yourself
.
<EOS>
Who
is
to
prove
that
the
confession
proceeds
not
from
the
Countess
?
<EOS>
Not
she
herself
;
since
no
one
will
believe
her
.
<EOS>
Not
Lord
Roos
;
for
he
will
be
equally
discredited
.
<EOS>
Not
Diego
;
for
his
testimony
would
be
valueless
.
<EOS>
The
Countess
's
hand
-
writing
has
been
so
skilfully
imitated
,
that
the
falsification
can
not
be
detected
.
<EOS>
Compare
it
with
this
note
written
by
herself
to
Lady
Roos
,
and
which
,
though
it
proves
nothing
,
has
so
far
answered
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
Compare
,
I
say
,
the
writing
of
the
confession
and
the
signature
with
this
note
,
and
declare
if
you
can
discern
any
difference
between
them
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
signatures
of
Lord
Roos
and
Diego
affixed
to
the
document
,
they
are
equally
well
simulated
.
<EOS>
""That
the
forgery
is
skilfully
executed
,
I
do
not
deny
,
"
replied
the
Secretary
of
State
;
"
and
that
circumstance
,
though
it
does
not
lessen
the
crime
,
may
lessen
the
chance
of
detection
.
<EOS>
Since
nothing
I
can
urge
will
turn
you
from
your
design
,
and
you
are
determined
to
employ
this
dangerous
instrument
,
at
least
be
cautious
in
its
use
.
<EOS>
Terrify
Lord
Roos
with
it
,
if
you
choose
.
<EOS>
Threaten
to
lay
it
before
the
Earl
of
Exeter
—
before
the
King
himself
—
in
case
of
our
son
-
in
-
law
's
non
-
compliance
with
your
demands
.
<EOS>
But
beware
how
you
proceed
further
.
<EOS>
Do
not
part
with
it
for
a
moment
;
so
that
,
if
need
be
,
you
may
destroy
it
.
<EOS>
Do
you
heed
me
,
my
lady?""I
do
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Be
assured
I
will
act
with
due
caution.—I
am
glad
to
find
you
are
coming
round
to
my
views
,
and
are
disposed
to
countenance
the
measure
.
<EOS>
""I
countenance
it
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
Secretary
of
State
,
in
alarm
.
"
<EOS>
No
such
thing
.
<EOS>
I
disapprove
of
it
entirely
,
and
can
not
sufficiently
reprehend
it
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
well
know
,
when
you
have
once
made
up
your
mind
,
the
fiend
himself
can
not
turn
you
from
your
purpose
,
I
give
you
the
best
counsel
I
can
under
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
I
wash
my
hands
of
it
altogether
.
<EOS>
Would
to
Heaven
I
had
never
been
consulted
upon
it
—
never
even
been
made
acquainted
with
the
project
.
<EOS>
However
,
as
you
have
gone
so
far
with
me
you
may
go
a
step
further
,
and
let
me
know
what
story
you
mean
to
attach
to
this
confession
?
<EOS>
How
will
you
feign
to
have
obtained
it?""The
statement
I
shall
make
will
be
this
,
and
it
will
be
borne
out
by
so
many
corroborative
circumstances
that
it
will
be
impossible
to
contradict
it
.
<EOS>
You
observe
that
the
document
is
dated
on
the
10th
of
April
last
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
without
reason
that
it
is
so
dated
.
<EOS>
On
that
day
I
and
our
daughter
,
Lady
Roos
,
attended
by
her
maid
,
Sarah
Swarton
,
proceeded
to
the
Earl
of
Exeter
's
residence
at
Wimbledon
,
for
the
purpose
of
having
an
interview
with
the
Countess
,
and
we
then
saw
her
in
the
presence
of
Lord
Roos
and
his
servant
Diego
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
you
gained
nothing
by
the
journey
?
"
remarked
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"Your
pardon
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
she
rejoined
;
"
I
gained
this
confession
.
<EOS>
On
the
way
back
I
reflected
upon
what
had
occurred
,
and
I
thought
how
flushed
with
triumph
I
should
have
been
<EOS>
if
,
instead
of
meeting
with
discomfiture
,
I
had
gained
my
point
—
if
I
had
brought
the
haughty
Countess
to
her
knees
—
had
compelled
her
to
write
out
and
sign
a
full
avowal
of
her
guilt
,
coupled
with
supplications
for
forgiveness
from
my
injured
daughter
and
myself
—
and
as
a
refinement
of
revenge
,
had
forced
Lord
Roos
and
his
servant
to
attest
by
their
signatures
the
truth
of
the
confession
!
<EOS>
I
thought
of
this
—
and
incensed
that
I
had
not
done
it
,
resolved
it
should
be
done
.
<EOS>
""An
ill
resolve
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
Luke
Hatton
,
our
apothecary
,
I
had
the
man
for
my
purpose
,
"
pursued
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"
Aware
of
his
marvellous
talent
for
imitating
any
writing
he
pleased
—
aware
,
also
,
that
I
could
entirely
rely
upon
him
,
I
resolved
to
call
in
his
aid
.
<EOS>
""Imprudent
woman
!
<EOS>
You
have
placed
yourself
wholly
in
his
power
,
"
groaned
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
"
Suppose
he
should
betray
the
terrible
trust
you
have
reposed
in
him?""He
will
not
betray
it
,
"
replied
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
too
deeply
implicated
in
the
matter
not
to
keep
silence
for
his
own
sake
.
<EOS>
But
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
The
document
,
such
as
you
see
it
,
was
drawn
out
by
myself
and
transcribed
by
Luke
Hatton
,
and
the
writing
so
admirably
counterfeited
that
Lady
Exeter
herself
may
well
doubt
if
it
be
not
her
own
.
<EOS>
Then
,
as
to
the
circumstances
,
they
will
all
bear
me
out
.
<EOS>
We
were
known
to
have
been
at
Wimbledon
on
the
day
in
question
.
<EOS>
We
were
known
to
have
had
an
interview
with
Lady
Exeter
,
at
which
Lord
Roos
and
Diego
were
present
.
<EOS>
The
interview
was
private
,
and
therefore
no
one
can
tell
what
took
place
at
it
;
but
the
probabilities
are
that
what
I
shall
assert
really
did
occur
.
"Sir
<EOS>
Thomas
signified
his
assent
,
and
she
went
on
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
plot
is
well
contrived
,
and
,
with
prudent
management
,
can
not
fail
of
success
.
<EOS>
We
have
the
time
of
the
supposed
occurrence
—
the
actors
in
it
—
and
the
scene
—
for
I
shall
describe
the
particular
room
in
which
the
interview
really
did
take
place
,
and
I
shall
further
bring
forward
Sarah
Swarton
,
who
will
declare
that
she
was
concealed
behind
the
hangings
,
and
heard
the
Countess
read
over
the
confession
before
she
signed
it
.
<EOS>
""Another
<EOS>
party
to
the
affair
—
and
a
woman
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
"
The
dangers
of
discovery
are
multiplied
a
hundredfold
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
danger
exists
only
in
your
imagination
,
"
said
his
Lady
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
admit
,
Sir
Thomas
,
that
the
scheme
is
well
contrived
,
and
that
they
must
be
cunning
indeed
if
they
escape
from
the
meshes
I
have
woven
for
them
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
displayed
ingenuity
enough
,
I
am
free
to
own
,
if
it
had
been
directed
to
a
better
end
;
but
in
the
best
contrived
scheme
some
flaw
is
ever
found
,
which
is
sure
to
mar
it
.
<EOS>
""You
can
detect
no
flaw
in
this
I
am
persuaded
,
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
If
you
can
,
let
me
know
it?""Nay
,
it
is
only
when
too
late
that
such
things
are
found
out
.
<EOS>
The
supposed
armour
of
proof
is
then
found
wanting
at
some
vital
point
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
will
say
no
more
,
"
he
observed
,
perceiving
her
impatience
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
done
can
not
be
undone
.
<EOS>
Have
you
prepared
our
daughter
?
<EOS>
Will
she
consent
to
aid
you?""She
<EOS>
will
,
"
replied
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
some
difficulty
with
her
at
first
,
but
I
found
means
to
overrule
her
scruples
,
and
she
consented
at
last
to
act
as
I
desired
,
<EOS>
provided
all
other
means
failed
of
accomplishing
the
object
in
view
.
<EOS>
And
they
have
failed
since
we
have
lost
those
letters
,
for
though
I
have
one
other
proof
left
which
might
perhaps
be
adduced
,
I
do
not
attach
much
importance
to
it
.
<EOS>
""What
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sir
Thomas
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
shall
know
anon
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Suffice
it
,
I
have
done
all
I
could
to
avoid
having
recourse
to
the
present
measure
;
and
have
delayed
—
its
execution
to
the
last
moment
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
that
proof
of
which
you
were
speaking
?
"
cried
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
hear
it
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
may
obviate
the
necessity
of
this
dangerous
proceeding?""I
do
not
think
so
.
<EOS>
But
you
shall
judge
.
<EOS>
Last
night
,
our
daughter
and
myself
obtained
secret
admittance
to
Lord
Roos
's
chamber
,
and
we
found
the
Countess
there
,
and
fainting
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
that
is
enough
to
convict
them
.
<EOS>
You
want
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
""Hear
me
to
an
end
,
and
you
will
change
your
opinion
.
<EOS>
Placing
the
inanimate
Countess
on
a
couch
,
and
covering
her
face
with
a
handkerchief
,
Lord
Roos
had
the
effrontery
to
assert
that
we
were
mistaken
;
insisting
that
it
was
not
Lady
Exeter
we
beheld
—
but
her
hand
-
maiden
,
Gillian
Greenford
;
and
he
appealed
to
the
perfidious
knave
,
Diego
,
in
confirmation
of
his
assertion
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
you
did
not
leave
without
satisfying
yourselves
of
the
truth
?
"
demanded
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
"His
<EOS>
lordship
took
care
<EOS>
we
should
have
no
means
of
doing
so
,
"
she
answered
.
"
<EOS>
He
caused
Diego
to
convey
her
away
by
a
secret
staircase
.
<EOS>
""'Sdeath
!
<EOS>
that
was
unlucky
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
proof
then
that
it
was
the
Countess
<EOS>
you
beheld?""Nothing
beyond
a
lock
of
her
hair
,
which
was
secured
by
Lady
Roos
as
the
man
was
removing
her
.
<EOS>
""That
may
be
enough
,
"
cried
the
Secretary
of
State
;
"
and
prevent
the
necessity
of
resorting
to
this
frightful
expedient
.
<EOS>
We
must
see
the
girl
,
and
interrogate
her
.
<EOS>
Gillian
Greenford
you
say
she
is
called
.
<EOS>
She
shall
be
brought
hither
at
once
.
<EOS>
""It
is
possible
she
may
be
without
,
"
returned
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"
Before
I
came
here
,
I
summoned
her
in
your
name
.
<EOS>
""We
will
see
,
"
cried
Sir
Thomas
,
striking
upon
the
bell
.
<EOS>
And
the
usher
,
appearing
to
the
summons
,
informed
him
that
in
effect
the
damsel
in
question
was
in
attendance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
seems
much
alarmed
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
said
the
usher
,
"
and
has
with
her
a
young
man
,
who
appears
to
take
a
tender
interest
in
her
,
and
wishes
to
be
present
at
the
investigation
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
him
come
in
with
her
,
"
said
the
Secretary
of
State
.
<EOS>
And
seeing
the
usher
pause
,
he
inquired
if
he
had
anything
further
to
say
.
<EOS>
"His
<EOS>
Excellency
<EOS>
the
Spanish
Ambassador
and
my
Lord
Roos
are
without
,
and
desire
admittance
,
"
replied
the
man
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
consulted
his
lady
by
a
look
;
and
as
she
made
no
objection
,
he
signified
his
pleasure
that
they
should
be
admitted
,
and
accordingly
the
door
was
thrown
open
for
the
entrance
of
all
the
persons
mentioned
.
<EOS>
Gillian
came
first
,
and
seemed
much
embarrassed
by
the
situation
in
which
she
found
herself
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
well
tutored
for
the
part
she
had
to
play
;
but
the
instructions
she
had
received
entirely
fled
from
her
mind
as
she
found
herself
in
the
presence
of
two
such
awful
personages
as
Sir
Thomas
Lake
and
his
lady
,
both
of
whom
fixed
keen
glances
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Feeling
ready
to
drop
with
fright
,
she
looked
at
Dick
Taverner
,
as
if
imploring
his
support
.
<EOS>
But
this
Dick
declined
to
afford
.
<EOS>
His
jealousy
having
been
roused
by
what
he
had
heard
,
he
determined
to
be
governed
in
his
conduct
towards
her
by
the
result
of
the
investigation
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
though
it
cost
him
an
effort
,
he
held
back
.
<EOS>
As
the
Conde
de
Gondomar
appeared
,
Sir
Thomas
Lake
arose
,
and
made
him
a
profound
salutation
,
which
was
returned
with
equal
ceremony
by
the
Spanish
Ambassador
.
<EOS>
The
latter
,
however
,
did
not
take
a
seat
,
but
remained
standing
with
Lord
Roos
,
whose
presence
was
acknowledged
by
a
cold
and
distant
bow
from
his
father
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
The
young
nobleman
did
not
appear
in
the
slightest
degree
disconcerted
by
the
reception
he
met
with
,
or
apprehensive
of
the
result
of
the
investigation
.
<EOS>
He
jested
apart
with
De
Gondomar
;
and
both
he
and
the
Spanish
Ambassador
appeared
greatly
amused
by
Gillian
's
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
Behind
him
stood
his
servant
Diego
.
<EOS>
"You
are
handmaiden
to
the
Countess
of
Exeter
,
I
presume
?
"
demanded
Lady
Lake
of
the
damsel
.
<EOS>
"I
am
,
my
lady
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"The
girl
does
not
look
as
if
the
imputations
cast
upon
her
character
can
be
true
,
"
observed
Sir
Thomas
Lake
.
<EOS>
As
this
was
said
,
poor
Gillian
became
suffused
with
blushes
,
and
hung
her
head
.
<EOS>
"Before
<EOS>
I
put
any
further
questions
to
her
,
"
remarked
Lady
Lake
,
"
I
will
ask
Lord
Roos
if
he
still
persists
in
affirming
that
it
was
this
damsel
who
visited
him
<EOS>
last
night?"Dick
<EOS>
Taverner
looked
as
if
his
fate
depended
upon
the
response
the
young
nobleman
might
make
to
the
inquiry
.
<EOS>
"I
must
decline
to
answer
your
ladyship
's
question
,
"
returned
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
can
not
he
speak
out
?
"
<EOS>
muttered
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
uncertainty
is
worse
than
anything
.
<EOS>
""What
says
the
damsel
herself
,
"
observed
Sir
Thomas
Lake
.
<EOS>
"
Does
she
admit
the
charge?""You
can
not
expect
her
to
do
that
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
interposed
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
"I
expect
her
to
answer
my
question
,
"
rejoined
the
Secretary
of
State
,
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
Were
you
in
Lord
Roos
's
room
last
night
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
to
Gillian
.
<EOS>
"Oh
<EOS>
,
dear
!
<EOS>
I
am
ready
to
faint
,
"
she
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
Catch
me
,
Dick
—
catch
me!""Answer
'
yes
'
or
'
no
,
'
or
I
wo
n't
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
then
,
'
yes
!
'
<EOS>
if
I
must
say
something
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
Poor
Dick
fell
back
,
as
if
struck
by
a
shot
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
n't
believe
it
,
"
cried
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
"Nor
<EOS>
I
either
,
"
said
Dick
,
recovering
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
she
could
do
such
a
wicked
thing
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
was
the
foreign
ambassador
,
there
,
"
he
added
,
pointing
to
De
Gondomar
,
"
who
seemed
most
enamoured
of
her
yesterday
;
and
I
should
n't
have
been
so
much
surprised
if
she
had
gone
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
did
,
"
he
continued
,
addressing
the
poor
damsel
,
who
again
hung
her
head
.
<EOS>
"I
can
take
upon
me
to
affirm
that
such
was
not
the
case
,
"
observed
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
the
lock
of
hair
with
you
?
"
<EOS>
whispered
Sir
Thomas
to
his
lady
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
,
"
she
replied
,
taking
a
small
packet
from
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
The
movement
did
not
pass
unnoticed
by
Lord
Roos
and
the
Spanish
Ambassador
,
between
whom
an
almost
imperceptible
smile
passed
.
<EOS>
"If
you
have
put
all
the
interrogations
you
desire
to
make
to
Gillian
,
Madam
,
"
said
Lord
Roos
to
his
mother
-
in
-
law
,
"
perhaps
she
may
be
permitted
to
depart
?
<EOS>
The
situation
can
not
be
agreeable
to
her
.
<EOS>
""A
<EOS>
moment
more
,
my
lord
,
"
cried
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
detain
her
it
is
to
clear
her
character
.
<EOS>
I
know
her
to
be
perfectly
innocent
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
announcement
,
Dick
Taverner
's
countenance
brightened
,
and
he
extended
his
arms
towards
Gillian
,
who
gladly
availed
herself
of
his
support
.
<EOS>
"I
am
quite
sure
she
was
not
the
person
I
surprised
in
your
chamber
last
night
,
"
continued
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"Indeed
<EOS>
,
Madam
!
<EOS>
How
do
you
arrive
at
that
conviction?""Because
that
person
's
hair
was
jet
black
,
whereas
Gillian
's
,
as
we
see
,
is
of
the
exactly
opposite
colour
.
<EOS>
"Dick
Taverner
could
not
help
pressing
his
lips
against
the
back
of
the
pretty
damsel
's
neck
as
this
was
uttered
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
proof
of
this
,
Madam
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
"Behold
it
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
This
look
of
hair
was
cut
off
before
your
visitant
escaped
,
and
has
remained
in
my
possession
ever
since
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
how
is
this
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
as
she
unfolded
the
packet
,
and
disclosed
a
tress
of
fair
hair
,
evidently
matching
Gillian
's
lint
-
white
locks
.
<EOS>
"
What
transformation
has
taken
place
!
<EOS>
Witchcraft
has
been
practised
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
Countess
's
work
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
minion
must
have
been
there
,
after
all
,
"
cried
Dick
Taverner
,
thrusting
Gillian
from
him
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
charge
of
witchcraft
will
not
serve
your
turn
,
Madam
,
"
said
Lord
Roos
derisively
.
<EOS>
"
The
explanation
is
simple
.
<EOS>
Your
eyes
have
deceived
you
.
<EOS>
""Most
<EOS>
palpably
,
"
cried
the
Conde
de
Gondomar
,
who
had
caught
Gillian
in
his
arms
,
as
the
jealous
apprentice
cast
her
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
her
ladyship
can
not
see
very
clearly
.
<EOS>
""I
see
clearly
enough
that
a
trick
has
been
practised
upon
me
,
"
Lady
Lake
rejoined
sharply
.
"
<EOS>
But
let
Lord
Roos
look
to
himself
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
my
revenge
,
and
a
terrible
one
it
shall
be
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
commit
yourself
,
"
said
Sir
Thomas
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
business
here
is
at
an
end
,
fair
maiden
,
"
said
the
Conde
de
Gondomar
to
Gillian
;
"
and
as
your
lover
abandons
you
,
I
am
ready
to
take
charge
of
you
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
he
led
her
forth
,
followed
by
Lord
Roos
,
whose
smile
of
triumph
exasperated
his
mother
-
in
-
law
almost
beyond
endurance
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
Dick
Tayerner
remained
irresolute
;
but
his
mistress
had
no
sooner
disappeared
,
than
he
rushed
after
her
,
vowing
he
would
have
her
back
if
it
cost
him
his
life
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXVII.The
<EOS>
Puritan
's
Prison
.
<EOS>
Hugh
Calveley
,
it
has
already
been
intimated
,
was
lodged
in
a
vault
beneath
the
gateway
.
<EOS>
The
place
was
commonly
used
as
a
sort
of
black
-
hole
for
the
imprisonment
of
any
refractory
member
of
the
royal
household
,
or
soldier
on
guard
guilty
of
neglect
of
duty
.
<EOS>
Circular
in
shape
,
it
contained
a
large
pillar
,
to
which
iron
rings
and
chains
were
attached
.
<EOS>
The
walls
were
of
stone
,
the
roof
arched
with
ribs
springing
from
the
pillar
that
supported
it
,
and
the
floor
was
paved
.
<EOS>
Window
there
was
none
;
but
air
was
admitted
through
a
small
grated
aperture
in
the
roof
;
and
thus
imperfectly
ventilated
,
it
will
not
be
wondered
at
that
the
vault
should
be
damp
.
<EOS>
Moisture
constantly
trickled
down
the
walls
,
and
collected
in
pools
on
the
broken
pavement
;
but
unwholesome
as
it
was
,
and
altogether
unfit
for
occupation
,
it
was
deemed
good
enough
for
those
generally
thrust
into
it
,
and
far
too
good
for
its
present
tenant
.
<EOS>
As
the
prisoner
exhibited
no
violence
,
the
thongs
with
which
his
hands
were
bound
were
removed
on
his
entrance
to
the
vault
,
and
he
was
allowed
the
free
use
of
his
limbs
.
<EOS>
The
breast
-
plate
in
which
he
was
clad
was
taken
from
him
,
and
his
vesture
was
again
closely
searched
,
but
no
further
discovery
was
made
either
of
concealed
weapon
,
or
of
any
paper
or
letter
tending
to
show
that
he
had
accomplices
in
his
dread
design
.
<EOS>
The
only
thing
found
upon
him
,
indeed
,
was
a
small
Bible
,
and
this
,
after
it
had
been
examined
,
he
was
permitted
to
retain
.
<EOS>
To
the
interrogatories
put
to
him
by
Master
Dendy
,
the
serjeant
-
at
-
arms
,
he
returned
the
briefest
answers
;
and
when
he
had
said
as
much
as
he
thought
fit
,
he
obstinately
refused
to
make
further
reply
.
<EOS>
Incensed
at
his
perversity
,
and
determined
to
extort
a
full
confession
,
in
order
that
it
might
be
laid
before
the
King
,
the
serjeant
-
at
-
arms
ordered
the
manacles
to
be
applied
.
<EOS>
But
though
the
torture
was
exquisite
,
he
bore
it
with
firmness
,
and
without
uttering
a
groan
;
maintaining
the
same
determined
silence
as
before
.
<EOS>
Had
he
dared
,
Master
Dendy
would
have
had
recourse
to
severer
measures
;
but
having
no
warrant
for
any
such
proceeding
,
he
was
obliged
to
content
himself
with
threats
.
<EOS>
To
these
Hugh
Calveley
replied
by
a
grim
smile
of
contempt
;
but
as
the
serjeant
-
at
-
arms
was
departing
to
make
his
report
to
Sir
Thomas
Lake
,
he
said
,
"
I
have
something
to
disclose
;
but
it
is
for
the
King
's
ear
alone
.
<EOS>
""Better
<EOS>
reveal
it
to
me
,
"
rejoined
Dendy
,
halting
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
it
in
my
power
to
render
your
situation
far
more
tolerable
,
or
to
inflict
greater
torment
upon
you
.
<EOS>
Make
your
choice
.
<EOS>
""Deal
with
me
as
you
please
,
"
returned
Hugh
Calveley
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
What
I
have
to
say
is
to
the
King
,
and
to
the
King
only
;
and
though
you
break
every
bone
in
my
body
with
your
engines
,
and
tear
off
my
flesh
with
red
-
hot
pincers
,
you
shall
not
force
the
secret
from
me
.
"Master
<EOS>
Dendy
looked
at
him
,
and
felt
disposed
to
place
him
in
the
dreadful
instrument
of
torture
called
Skeffington
's
irons
,
which
was
hanging
against
the
wall
;
but
the
consideration
that
had
hitherto
restrained
him
—
namely
,
that
he
was
without
authority
for
the
step
,
and
might
be
called
to
account
for
it
—
weighed
with
him
still
;
wherefore
he
contented
himself
with
ordering
the
prisoner
to
be
chained
to
the
pillar
;
and
having
seen
the
injunction
obeyed
,
he
left
him
.
<EOS>
In
this
miserable
plight
Hugh
Calveley
remained
for
some
hours
,
without
light
and
without
food
.
<EOS>
How
the
time
was
passed
none
knew
;
but
the
two
yeomen
of
the
guard
who
entered
the
vault
found
him
on
his
knees
absorbed
in
prayer
.
<EOS>
They
brought
a
lamp
with
them
,
and
refreshments
of
a
better
kind
than
those
usually
afforded
to
a
prisoner
,
and
set
them
before
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
refused
to
partake
of
them
.
<EOS>
The
only
favour
he
besought
was
permission
to
read
his
Bible
;
and
the
lamp
placed
within
reach
,
he
was
soon
deeply
engrossed
in
the
perusal
of
those
pages
from
which
,
when
earnestly
sought
,
consolation
has
ever
been
derived
under
the
most
trying
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
had
forborne
to
visit
the
prisoner
from
a
fear
that
his
presence
might
be
painful
;
but
the
office
imposed
upon
him
by
the
King
left
him
no
alternative
;
and
about
midnight
he
descended
to
the
vault
,
to
ascertain
from
personal
inspection
that
Hugh
Calveley
was
in
safe
custody
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
unlocked
by
the
halberdier
stationed
at
it
,
and
the
young
man
found
himself
alone
with
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
He
was
inexpressibly
shocked
by
the
spectacle
he
beheld
,
as
he
had
no
idea
how
severely
the
unfortunate
Puritan
had
been
treated
,
nor
of
the
sort
of
prison
in
which
he
was
confined
.
<EOS>
Hugh
Calveley
,
who
was
still
intently
reading
the
Bible
,
which
he
had
placed
upon
his
knee
while
he
held
the
lamp
near
it
,
to
throw
the
light
upon
its
leaves
,
did
not
appear
to
be
disturbed
by
the
opening
of
the
door
,
nor
did
he
raise
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
But
,
at
last
,
a
deep
groan
issuing
from
the
breast
of
the
young
man
aroused
him
,
and
he
held
up
the
lamp
to
ascertain
who
was
near
.
<EOS>
On
discovering
that
it
was
Sir
Jocelyn
,
he
knitted
his
brow
,
and
,
after
sternly
regarding
him
for
a
moment
,
returned
to
his
Bible
,
without
uttering
a
word
;
but
finding
the
other
maintained
his
post
,
he
demanded
,
almost
fiercely
,
why
he
was
disturbed?"Can
<EOS>
I
do
aught
for
your
relief
?
"
rejoined
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
I
can
have
those
chains
taken
off
.
<EOS>
""Thou
speakest
as
one
in
authority
,
"
cried
Hugh
Calveley
,
regarding
him
,
fixedly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Art
thou
appointed
to
be
my
jailer?"Sir
Jocelyn
<EOS>
made
no
answer
,
but
averted
his
head
.
<EOS>
"This
only
was
wanting
to
fill
up
the
measure
of
my
scorn
for
thee
,
"
pursued
the
Puritan
.
"
<EOS>
Thou
art
worthy
of
thine
office
.
<EOS>
But
show
me
no
favour
,
for
I
will
receive
none
at
thy
hands
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
wear
these
fetters
to
my
death
,
however
much
they
may
gall
my
limbs
,
than
have
them
struck
off
by
thee
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
rot
in
this
dungeon
—
<EOS>
ay
,
though
it
were
worse
than
it
is
—
than
owe
my
liberation
to
thee
.
<EOS>
The
sole
favour
thou
canst
show
me
is
to
rid
me
of
thy
presence
,
which
is
hateful
to
me
,
and
chases
holy
thoughts
from
my
breast
,
putting
evil
in
their
place
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
should
this
be
so
,
O
friend
of
my
father
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Sir
Jocelyn
.
"
<EOS>
And
why
should
my
presence
be
hateful
to
you
?
<EOS>
There
is
no
man
living
whom
I
would
less
willingly
offend
than
yourself
;
and
in
all
I
have
done
,
where
you
have
been
concerned
,
I
have
had
no
free
agency
.
<EOS>
Judge
me
not
then
too
harshly
.
<EOS>
I
commiserate
your
situation
from
the
depths
of
my
heart
,
and
would
relieve
it
were
it
possible
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
wherefore
persist
in
troubling
me
?
"
rejoined
Hugh
Calveley
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
I
not
good
cause
for
my
dislike
of
you
?
<EOS>
You
have
disappointed
the
expectations
I
had
formed
of
you
.
<EOS>
You
failed
me
when
I
put
your
professions
to
the
test
.
<EOS>
You
thwarted
my
design
at
the
moment
when
its
success
was
certain
,
and
when
the
tyrant
was
completely
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
But
for
you
I
should
not
be
here
,
loaded
with
these
fetters
;
or
if
I
were
,
I
should
be
consoled
by
the
thought
that
I
had
liberated
my
country
from
oppression
,
instead
of
being
crushed
by
the
sense
of
failure
.
<EOS>
What
seek
you
from
me
,
miserable
time
-
server
?
<EOS>
Have
you
not
had
your
reward
for
the
service
you
have
rendered
the
King
?
<EOS>
Is
he
not
grateful
enough
?
<EOS>
I
have
served
as
your
stepping
-
stone
to
promotion
.
<EOS>
What
more
can
I
do?""You
can
cease
to
do
me
injustice
,
"
returned
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"
Honours
,
procured
as
mine
have
been
,
are
valueless
,
and
I
would
rather
be
without
them
.
<EOS>
I
sought
them
not
.
<EOS>
They
have
been
forced
upon
me
.
<EOS>
Look
at
the
matter
fairly
,
and
you
will
see
that
all
these
consequences
,
whether
for
good
or
ill
,
have
sprung
from
your
own
desperate
act
.
<EOS>
""It
may
be
so
,
"
rejoined
the
Puritan
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
dispute
it
.
<EOS>
But
though
ill
has
accrued
to
me
,
and
good
to
you
,
I
would
not
change
positions
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
wear
the
tyrant
's
fetters
for
ever
.
<EOS>
I
shall
soon
be
free
from
mine
.
<EOS>
""Have
you
nothing
to
say
concerning
your
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
"Nothing
,
"
replied
the
Puritan
,
with
an
expression
of
deep
pain
,
which
,
however
,
he
checked
by
a
mighty
effort
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
with
the
world
,
and
desire
not
to
be
brought
back
to
it
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
you
refuse
to
be
freed
from
your
chains?""My
sole
desire
,
as
I
have
said
,
is
to
be
freed
from
you
.
<EOS>
""That
wish
,
at
least
,
shall
be
granted
,
"
replied
Sir
Jocelyn
,
as
,
with
a
sad
heart
,
he
departed
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXVIII.The
Secret
.
<EOS>
Thrice
was
the
guard
relieved
during
that
long
night
,
and
as
often
was
the
prisoner
visited
.
<EOS>
On
the
first
occasion
,
he
was
found
to
be
still
engaged
with
his
Bible
,
and
he
so
continued
during
the
whole
time
the
man
remained
in
the
vault
.
<EOS>
The
next
who
came
discovered
him
on
his
knees
,
praying
loudly
and
fervently
,
and
,
unwilling
to
disturb
him
,
left
him
at
his
devotions
.
<EOS>
But
the
third
who
entered
was
struck
with
terror
at
the
prisoner
's
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
had
risen
from
the
ground
,
and
was
standing
as
erect
as
the
fetters
would
permit
,
with
his
hands
outstretched
,
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
vacancy
.
<EOS>
He
was
muttering
something
,
but
his
words
were
unintelligible
.
<EOS>
He
looked
like
one
who
beheld
a
vision
;
and
this
impression
was
produced
upon
the
man
,
who
half
expected
some
awful
shape
to
reveal
itself
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
whatever
it
might
be
,
spirit
of
good
or
ill
,
it
was
visible
to
the
Puritan
alone
.
<EOS>
After
gazing
at
him
for
some
minutes
,
in
mixed
wonderment
and
fright
,
the
halberdier
ventured
to
draw
near
him
.
<EOS>
As
he
touched
him
,
the
Puritan
uttered
a
fearful
cry
,
and
attempted
to
spring
forward
,
as
if
to
grasp
some
vanishing
object
,
but
being
checked
in
the
effort
by
the
chain
,
he
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
,
and
seemed
to
sustain
severe
injury
;
for
when
the
man
raised
him
,
and
set
him
against
the
pillar
,
though
he
made
no
complaint
,
it
was
evident
he
suffered
excruciating
pain
.
<EOS>
The
halberdier
poured
out
a
cup
of
wine
,
and
offered
it
to
him
;
but
,
though
well
-
nigh
fainting
,
he
peremptorily
refused
it
.
<EOS>
From
this
moment
a
marked
change
was
perceptible
in
his
looks
.
<EOS>
The
hue
of
his
skin
became
cadaverous
;
his
eyes
grew
dim
and
glassy
;
and
his
respiration
was
difficult
.
<EOS>
Everything
betokened
that
his
sufferings
would
be
speedily
over
,
and
that
,
however
he
might
deserve
it
,
Hugh
Calveley
would
be
spared
the
disgrace
of
death
by
the
hands
of
the
executioner
.
<EOS>
The
halberdier
was
not
unaware
of
his
condition
,
and
his
first
impulse
was
to
summon
assistance
;
but
he
was
deterred
from
doing
so
by
the
earnest
entreaty
of
the
Puritan
to
be
left
alone
;
and
thinking
this
the
most
merciful
course
he
could
pursue
under
the
circumstances
,
he
yielded
to
the
request
,
scarcely
expecting
to
behold
him
alive
again
.
<EOS>
It
was
by
this
same
man
that
the
door
of
the
vault
was
opened
to
Sir
Jocelyn
and
Aveline
.
<EOS>
The
shock
experienced
by
the
maiden
at
the
sight
of
her
father
had
well
-
nigh
overcome
her
.
<EOS>
She
thought
him
dead
,
and
such
was
Sir
Jocelyn
's
first
impression
.
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
Puritan
was
still
propped
against
the
pillar
,
as
the
halberdier
had
left
him
,
but
his
head
had
fallen
to
one
side
,
and
his
arms
hung
listlessly
down
.
<EOS>
With
a
piercing
shriek
his
daughter
flew
towards
him
,
and
kneeling
beside
him
,
raised
his
head
gently
,
and
gazing
eagerly
into
his
face
,
perceived
that
he
still
lived
,
though
the
spirit
seemed
ready
to
wing
its
flight
from
its
fleshly
tabernacle
.
<EOS>
The
situation
was
one
to
call
forth
every
latent
energy
in
Aveline
's
character
.
<EOS>
Controlling
her
emotion
,
she
uttered
no
further
cry
,
but
set
herself
,
with
calmness
,
to
apply
such
restoratives
as
were
at
hand
to
her
father
.
<EOS>
After
bathing
his
temples
and
chafing
his
hands
,
she
had
the
satisfaction
,
ere
long
,
of
seeing
him
open
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
he
seemed
to
have
a
difficulty
in
fixing
his
gaze
upon
her
,
but
her
voice
reached
his
ears
,
and
the
feeble
pressure
of
his
hand
told
that
he
knew
her
.
<EOS>
The
power
of
speech
returned
to
him
at
length
,
and
he
faintly
murmured
,
"
My
child
,
I
am
glad
to
see
you
once
more
.
<EOS>
I
thought
all
was
over
;
but
it
has
pleased
Heaven
to
spare
me
for
a
few
moments
to
give
you
my
blessing
.
<EOS>
Bow
down
your
head
,
O
my
daughter
,
and
take
it
;
and
though
given
by
a
sinner
like
myself
,
it
shall
profit
you
!
<EOS>
May
the
merciful
God
,
who
pardoneth
all
that
repent
,
even
at
the
last
hour
,
and
watcheth
over
the
orphan
,
bless
you
,
and
protect
you!""Amen
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Jocelyn
,
fervently
.
"Who
<EOS>
was
it
spoke
?
"
demanded
the
Puritan
.
<EOS>
And
as
no
answer
was
returned
,
he
repeated
the
inquiry
.
<EOS>
"It
was
I
—
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
,
the
son
of
your
old
friend
,
"
replied
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
"Come
<EOS>
nigh
to
me
,
Jocelyn
<EOS>
,
"
said
the
dying
man
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
you
wrong
,
and
entreat
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
""O
,
talk
not
thus
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jocelyn
,
springing
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
forgive
,
but
much
to
be
forgiven
.
<EOS>
""You
have
a
noble
heart
,
Jocelyn
,
"
rejoined
Hugh
Calveley
;
"
and
in
that
respect
resemble
your
father
.
<EOS>
In
his
name
,
I
conjure
you
to
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
refuse
my
dying
request
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
sacred
trust
to
commit
to
you
.
<EOS>
""Name
it
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
young
man
;
"
and
rest
assured
it
shall
be
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
""Give
me
<EOS>
some
wine
,
"
gasped
the
Puritan
,
faintly
.
<EOS>
"
My
strength
is
failing
fast
,
and
it
may
revive
me
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
with
,
great
effort
he
swallowed
a
few
drops
from
the
cup
filled
for
him
by
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
Still
,
his
appearance
was
so
alarming
,
that
the
young
man
could
not
help
urging
him
not
to
delay
.
<EOS>
"I
understand
,
"
replied
Hugh
Calveley
,
slightly
pressing
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
You
think
I
have
no
time
to
lose
;
and
you
are
right
.
<EOS>
My
child
,
then
,
is
the
trust
I
would
confide
to
you
.
<EOS>
Son
,
behold
thy
sister
!
<EOS>
Daughter
,
behold
thy
brother!""I
will
be
more
than
a
brother
to
her
,
"
cried
Sir
Jocelyn
,
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"More
<EOS>
thou
canst
not
be
,
"
rejoined
Hugh
Calveley
;
"
unless—""Unless
what
?
"
demanded
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"I
can
not
explain
,
"
cried
the
Puritan
,
with
an
expression
of
agony
;
"
there
is
not
time
.
<EOS>
Suffice
it
,
she
is
already
promised
in
marriage
.
<EOS>
""Father
!
"
exclaimed
Aveline
,
in
surprise
,
and
with
something
of
reproach
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
of
such
an
engagement
before
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
made
without
my
consent
.
<EOS>
""I
charge
you
to
fulfil
it
,
nevertheless
,
my
child
,
if
it
be
required
,
"
said
Hugh
Calveley
,
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Promise
me
this
,
or
I
shall
not
die
content
.
<EOS>
Speak
!
<EOS>
Let
me
hear
you
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
she
reluctantly
gave
the
required
promise
.
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
uttered
an
exclamation
of
anguish
.
<EOS>
"What
afflicts
you
,
my
son
?
"
demanded
the
Puritan
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
whom
have
you
promised
your
daughter
in
marriage
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
constituted
me
her
brother
,
and
I
am
therefore
entitled
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
""You
will
learn
when
the
demand
is
made
,
"
said
the
Puritan
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
then
know
why
I
have
given
the
promise
,
and
the
nature
of
the
obligation
imposed
upon
my
daughter
to
fulfil
it
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
is
this
obligation
ever
to
remain
binding
?
"
demanded
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
the
claim
be
not
made
within
a
year
after
my
death
,
she
is
discharged
from
it
,
"
replied
Hugh
Calveley
.
<EOS>
"O
,
thanks
,
father
,
thanks
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Aveline
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
the
door
of
the
vault
was
thrown
open
,
and
two
persons
entered
,
the
foremost
of
whom
Sir
Jocelyn
instantly
recognised
as
the
King
.
<EOS>
The
other
was
his
Majesty
's
physician
,
Doctor
Mayerne
Turquet
.
<EOS>
A
glance
sufficed
to
explain
to
the
latter
the
state
of
the
Puritan
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
parbleu
!
<EOS>
the
man
is
dying
,
your
Majesty
,
"
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"Deeing
!
<EOS>
is
he
?
<EOS>
"
cried
James
.
<EOS>
"
The
mair
reason
he
suld
tell
his
secret
,
to
us
without
procrastination
.
<EOS>
Harkye
,
prophet
of
ill
!
"
<EOS>
he
continued
,
as
he
strode
forward
.
<EOS>
"
The
judgment
of
Heaven
ye
predicated
for
us
,
seems
to
have
fallen
on
your
ainsell
,
and
to
have
laid
you
low
,
even
afore
our
arm
could
touch
you
.
<EOS>
Ye
have
gude
reason
to
be
thankful
<EOS>
you
have
escaped
the
woodie
;
sae
e'en
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
,
confess
your
enormities
,
and
reveal
to
us
the
secret
matter
whilk
<EOS>
we
are
tauld
ye
hae
to
communicate!""Let
<EOS>
all
else
withdraw
a
few
paces
,
"
said
Hugh
Calveley
,
"
and
do
thou
,
O
King
,
approach
me
.
<EOS>
What
I
have
to
say
is
for
thine
ear
alone
.
<EOS>
""There
will
be
no
danger
in
granting
his
request
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
James
of
his
physician
.
<EOS>
"None
<EOS>
whatever
,
"
replied
Doctor
Mayerne
Turquet
.
<EOS>
"
The
only
danger
is
in
delay
.
<EOS>
Your
Majesty
should
lose
no
time
.
<EOS>
The
man
is
passing
rapidly
away
.
<EOS>
A
few
moments
more
,
and
he
will
have
ceased
to
exist
.
<EOS>
"On
<EOS>
a
sign
from
the
King
,
Sir
Jocelyn
then
stepped
aside
,
but
Aveline
refused
to
quit
her
father
,
even
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
As
James
drew
near
,
Hugh
Calveley
raised
himself
a
little
in
order
to
address
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
say
unto
thee
,
O
King
,
"
he
cried
,
"
as
Elijah
said
unto
Ahab
,
'
Because
thou
hast
sold
thyself
to
work
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
Lord
—
behold
!
<EOS>
I
will
bring
evil
upon
thee
,
and
will
take
away
thy
posterity
.
<EOS>
And
I
will
make
thine
house
like
the
house
of
Jeroboam
the
son
of
Nebat
,
and
like
the
house
of
Baasha
the
son
of
Ahijah
,
for
the
provocation
wherewith
thou
hast
provoked
me
to
anger
,
and
made
Israel
to
sin
.
<EOS>
'""Now
<EOS>
the
muckle
Diel
seize
thee
,
villain
!
"
exclaimed
James
furiously
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
to
listen
to
thy
texts
that
thou
hast
brought
me
hither
?
"
<EOS>
And
as
Hugh
Calveley
,
exhausted
by
the
effort
he
had
made
,
fell
back
with
a
groan
,
he
bent
his
head
towards
him
,
crying
,
"
The
secret
,
man
,
the
secret
!
<EOS>
or
the
tormenter
shall
wring
it
from
thee?"The
Puritan
essayed
to
speak
,
but
his
voice
was
so
low
that
it
did
not
reach
the
ears
of
the
King
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
sayest
thou
?
<EOS>
"
he
demanded
.
<EOS>
"
Speak
louder
.
<EOS>
Saul
of
our
body
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
during
which
the
sudden
alteration
that
took
place
in
the
prisoner
's
features
made
him
suspect
that
all
was
over
.
<EOS>
"
Our
belief
is
he
will
never
speak
again
.
<EOS>
He
hath
escaped
us
,
and
ta'en
his
secret
wi
'
him
.
<EOS>
"A
loud
shriek
burst
from
Aveline
,
as
she
fell
upon
her
father
's
lifeless
body
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
us
forth
,
"
cried
the
King
,
stopping
his
ears
.
<EOS>
"
We
carena
to
be
present
at
scenes
like
this
.
<EOS>
We
hae
had
<EOS>
a
gude
riddance
o

<EOS>
this
traitor

though
we
wad
hae
gladly
heard
what
he
had
to
tell

<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
,
ye
will
see
that
this
young
woman
be
cared
for
;
and
when
ye
have
caused
her
to
be
removed
elsewhere
,
follow
us
to
the
tennis
-
court
,
to
which
we
shall
incontinently
adjourn

"So

,
he
quitted
the
vault
with
his
physician

<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXIX.Luke
Hatton
.
<EOS>
Feigning
sudden
indisposition
(
and
the
excuse
was
not
altogether
without
foundation
)
,
the
Countess
of
Exeter
quitted
Theobalds
Palace
on
the
day
after
her
unlucky
visit
to
Lord
Roos
's
chamber
,
and
proceeded
to
her
husband
's
residence
at
Wimbledon
,
where
she
was
speedily
joined
by
her
lover
,
who
brought
her
word
of
the
advantage
he
had
gained
over
their
foe
.
<EOS>
"I
have
fairly
checkmated
my
gracious
mother
-
in
-
law
,
"
he
cried
,
with
a
laugh
;
"
and
it
would
have
diverted
you
as
much
as
it
did
me
and
De
Gondomar
,
who
was
present
on
the
occasion
,
if
you
could
have
witnessed
her
rage
and
mortification
,
when
she
discovered
the
change
that
had
been
effected
;
and
that
in
place
of
your
magnificent
black
ringlet
(
which
I
now
wear
next
my
heart
,
and
shall
ever
keep
as
a
love
-
token
)
,
she
had
only
a
sorry
specimen
of
your
hand
-
maiden
's
lint
-
white
locks
.
<EOS>
As
I
live
,
it
was
truly
laughable
.
<EOS>
The
good
lady
would
have
annihilated
me
if
she
could
;
and
threatened
me
with
terrible
reprisals
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
she
tried
to
attribute
the
transformation
,
which
she
could
not
otherwise
account
for
,
to
witchcraft
;
and
though
I
derided
the
charge
<EOS>
,
I
must
needs
say
,
the
trick
was
so
cleverly
performed
,
that
it
did
look
like
magic
.
<EOS>
The
packet
containing
the
tress
of
hair
had
never
been
out
of
her
own
keeping
.
<EOS>
This
she
affirmed
;
and
it
was
true
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
friendly
hand
to
open
it
nevertheless
;
to
purloin
its
priceless
treasure
;
and
to
substitute
something
of
a
similar
kind
,
though
of
comparatively
little
value
in
its
place
.
<EOS>
That
hand,—one
not
likely
to
be
suspected
,
was
no
other
than
that
of
my
lady
's
confidential
attendant
,
Sarah
Swarton
.
<EOS>
The
juggle
was
played
by
her
at
the
instance
of
Diego
.
<EOS>
Anticipating
some
such
occurrence
as
the
present
,
and
desirous
of
having
a
spy
upon
the
movements
of
our
enemies
,
I
some
time
since
directed
Diego
to
pay
secret
court
to
Sarah
,
and
my
forethought
has
now
been
rewarded
.
<EOS>
The
main
difficulty
lay
with
poor
Gillian
.
<EOS>
She
was
greatly
embarrassed
by
her
situation
;
and
her
perplexity
was
increased
by
the
presence
of
a
jealous
lover
in
the
shape
of
an
apprentice
,
who
refused
to
leave
her
till
his
doubts
should
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
This
was
awkward
,
as
the
story
could
not
be
very
well
reconciled
so
as
to
suit
all
parties
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
when
the
discovery
was
made
,
which
seemed
to
proclaim
the
poor
girl
's
infidelity
,
the
youth
's
rage
and
consternation
were
nearly
equal
to
Lady
Lake
's
;
a
circumstance
that
added
considerable
zest
to
the
comedy
.
<EOS>
But
I
see
it
does
not
divert
you
so
much
as
I
expected
,
and
therefore
,
to
relieve
your
mind
,
I
may
tell
you
that
the
jealous
varlet
soon
repented
of
his
rash
determination
,
and
pursuing
his
mistress
,
whom
Do
Gondomar
had
considerately
taken
under
his
protection
,
prevailed
upon
her
to
give
the
amorous
ambassador
the
slip
,
and
return
with
him
to
her
father
's
abode
at
Tottenham
.
<EOS>
""I
am
right
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
said
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
"
Though
I
have
seen
so
little
of
Gillian
,
I
can
not
help
taking
an
interest
in
her
;
she
is
so
pretty
,
and
so
innocent
in
appearance
,
and
her
manners
are
so
artless
and
engaging
.
<EOS>
I
owe
her
some
reparation
for
the
mischief
I
have
done
her
,
and
will
not
neglect
to
make
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
I
ever
was
induced
by
you
to
take
her
into
my
service
;
and
I
am
thankful
to
hear
she
has
escaped
De
Gondomar
's
snares
.
<EOS>
""You
are
wonderfully
interested
about
her
,
methinks
,
Frances
;
and
I
hope
she
will
be
grateful
for
your
consideration
,
"
rejoined
Lord
Roos
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
should
not
be
surprised
if
De
Gondomar
still
gained
his
point
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
his
way
to
give
up
a
pursuit
he
has
once
undertaken
.
<EOS>
However
,
to
leave
the
pretty
damsel
to
her
fate
,
which
will
depend
entirely
on
her
own
conduct
,
let
us
return
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
We
have
good
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
the
issue
of
this
adventure
of
the
lock
of
hair
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
that
recurrence
to
the
charge
of
witchcraft
on
the
part
of
my
vindictive
mother
-
in
-
law
shows
the
extent
of
her
malice
,
and
I
can
not
doubt
that
in
threatening
me
with
reprisals
she
will
be
as
good
as
her
word
.
<EOS>
It
behoves
us
,
therefore
,
to
be
beforehand
with
her
.
<EOS>
What
she
may
intend
I
can
not
say
,
but
I
am
satisfied
she
has
a
formidable
scheme
on
foot
,
and
that
nothing
but
her
husband
's
interposition
prevented
its
disclosure
when
she
was
so
violently
incensed
against
me
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
fill
me
with
terror
,
William
,
"
exclaimed
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Will
this
woman
's
hostility
towards
me
never
cease?""Never
,
"
replied
Lord
Roos
,
with
a
sudden
change
of
manner
,
and
laying
aside
the
levity
he
had
hitherto
exhibited
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
but
one
way
of
ending
the
struggle
.
<EOS>
Luke
Hatton
can
help
us
to
it
.
<EOS>
Persuaded
we
should
require
him
,
I
have
brought
him
with
me
.
<EOS>
He
waits
in
the
hall
below
with
Diego
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
summon
him
to
our
conference?""On
<EOS>
no
account
,
"
exclaimed
Lady
Exeter
hastily
;
"
I
will
not
see
him
.
<EOS>
You
have
done
wrong
to
bring
that
poisoner
here
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
You
will
destroy
me
.
<EOS>
""Listen
<EOS>
to
me
,
Frances
,
"
replied
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
"
The
next
step
taken
by
Lady
Lake
will
be
fatal
to
us
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
no
delay
,
no
irresolution
on
our
part
,
or
all
is
lost
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
depend
upon
myself
,
or
I
would
not
call
in
another
's
aid
.
<EOS>
You
will
comprehend
how
wanting
in
firmness
I
am
,
when
I
tell
you
what
happened
the
other
night
.
<EOS>
Incredible
as
it
may
sound
,
my
wife
,
in
order
to
prove
her
devotion
to
me
and
to
free
me
from
further
annoyance
on
her
part
,
offered
to
take
poison
;
and
but
for
my
interference
(
fool
that
I
was
to
stay
her
!
)
<EOS>
would
have
drained
the
phial
containing
the
deadly
potion
.
<EOS>
The
weakness
was
momentary
,
and
I
reproached
myself
for
it
when
too
late
.
<EOS>
But
it
convinced
me
that
a
firmer
hand
than
mine
must
be
employed
in
the
task
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
can
you
,
after
what
you
have
related
,
William,—can
you
seriously
meditate
the
destruction
of
a
fond
woman
,
who
has
generosity
enough
to
lay
down
her
life
for
you
?
<EOS>
This
is
more
incredible
than
the
rest
—
more
monstrously
wicked
.
<EOS>
""Wicked
<EOS>
it
may
be
;
but
the
excuse
—
if
I
have
any
—
lies
in
my
overwhelming
passion
for
you
,
Frances
,
"
replied
Lord
Roos
in
a
frenzied
tone
.
"
<EOS>
And
it
seems
decided
by
the
relentless
destiny
that
governs
me
,
that
the
continued
indulgence
of
the
fatal
passion
shall
only
be
purchased
at
the
price
of
my
soul
.
<EOS>
That
penalty
I
am
prepared
to
pay
rather
than
lose
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
become
obdurate
,
will
turn
my
heart
to
stone
,
so
that
it
shall
no
more
melt
at
the
tears
of
this
fond
,
foolish
woman
;
and
I
will
slay
her
without
remorse
.
<EOS>
Any
other
obstacle
between
us
shall
be
removed;—be
it
her
mother
,
her
father
—
your
husband
!
<EOS>
I
will
immolate
a
hundred
victims
at
the
altar
of
our
love
.
<EOS>
I
will
shrink
from
nothing
to
make
you
mine
for
ever
.
<EOS>
For
I
would
rather
share
eternal
bale
with
you
,
Frances
,
than
immortal
bliss
with
another
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
almost
make
me
fancy
some
evil
being
has
obtained
possession
of
you
,
William
,
"
said
the
Countess
,
gazing
at
him
with
affright
.
<EOS>
"It
may
be
that
the
Fiend
himself
hath
accepted
my
wild
offer
<EOS>
,
"
he
rejoined
gloomily
;
"
but
if
my
wish
be
granted
it
matters
not
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
listen
to
such
fearful
impiety
,
"
said
the
Countess
,
shuddering
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
dismiss
this
subject
for
the
present
,
and
recur
to
it
when
you
are
calmer
.
<EOS>
""It
can
not
be
postponed
,
Frances
.
<EOS>
Time
presses
,
and
even
now
Lady
Lake
may
have
got
the
start
of
us
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
calm
enough
when
this
is
over
.
<EOS>
Will
you
consent
to
see
Luke
Hatton?""Why
need
I
see
him
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
Countess
with
increasing
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
"
Why
will
you
force
his
hateful
presence
upon
me
?
<EOS>
If
the
deed
must
be
done
,
why
can
you
not
alone
undertake
it?""I
will
tell
why
I
can
not
,
"
he
replied
in
a
sombre
tone
,
and
regarding
her
fixedly
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
a
partner
in
the
crime
.
<EOS>
It
will
bind
us
to
each
other
in
links
not
to
be
severed
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
no
fear
of
losing
you
then
,
Countess
.
<EOS>
I
go
to
bring
Luke
Hatton
to
you
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
without
waiting
for
her
reply
he
strode
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Lady
Exeter
would
have
arrested
him
,
but
she
had
not
the
nerve
to
do
so
,
and
with
an
exclamation
of
anguish
she
fell
back
in
her
chair
.
<EOS>
"What
dominion
sin
has
usurped
over
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
mentally
ejaculated
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
lost
the
power
of
resisting
its
further
encroachment
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
enormity
of
the
offence
I
am
about
to
commit
,
and
though
my
soul
revolts
at
it
,
I
can
not
hold
back
.
<EOS>
I
am
as
one
on
the
brink
of
a
precipice
,
who
beholds
the
dreadful
gulf
before
him
,
into
which
another
step
must
plunge
him
,
yet
is
too
giddy
to
retreat
,
and
must
needs
fall
over
.
<EOS>
Pity
me
,
kind
Heaven
!
<EOS>
I
am
utterly
helpless
without
thy
aid
.
"While
<EOS>
the
unhappy
lady
thus
unavailingly
deplored
the
sad
position
in
which
her
own
misconduct
had
placed
her
,
and
from
which
she
felt
wholly
incapable
of
extricating
herself
;
while
in
this
wretched
frame
of
mind
,
she
awaited
her
lover
's
return,—with
,
as
we
have
shown
,
some
remains
of
good
struggling
with
the
evil
in
her
bosom,—we
will
cast
a
hasty
glance
round
the
chamber
in
which
she
sat
.
<EOS>
And
we
are
prompted
to
do
this
,
not
because
it
merits
particular
description
,
but
because
it
was
the
room
referred
to
by
Lady
Lake
as
the
scene
of
the
confession
she
had
forged
.
<EOS>
The
apartment
,
then
,
was
spacious
and
handsomely
furnished
in
the
heavy
taste
of
the
period
,
with
but
little
to
distinguish
it
from
other
rooms
visited
by
us
in
the
course
of
this
story
.
<EOS>
Like
most
of
them
,
it
had
a
gloomy
air
,
caused
by
the
dark
hue
of
its
oaken
panels
,
and
the
heavy
folds
of
its
antiquated
and
faded
tapestry
.
<EOS>
The
latter
was
chiefly
hung
against
the
lower
end
of
the
chamber
,
and
served
as
a
screen
to
one
of
the
doors
.
<EOS>
At
the
opposite
end
,
there
was
a
wide
and
deep
bay
window
,
glowing
with
stained
glass
,
amid
the
emblazonry
of
which
might
be
discerned
the
proud
escutcheon
of
the
house
of
Exeter
,
with
the
two
lions
rampant
forming
its
supporters
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
of
the
enormous
carved
mantel
-
piece
,
which
,
with
its
pillars
,
statues
,
'
scutcheons
,
and
massive
cornice
,
mounted
to
the
very
ceiling
,
was
hung
a
portrait
of
the
Earl
of
Exeter
—
<EOS>
a
grave
,
dignified
personage
,
clad
in
the
attire
of
Elizabeth
's
time
;
and
on
the
left
,
was
a
likeness
of
the
Countess
herself
,
painted
in
all
the
pride
of
her
unequalled
beauty
,
and
marvellous
in
resemblance
then
;
but
how
different
in
expression
from
her
features
now!In
the
recess
of
the
window
stood
an
oak
table
,
covered
with
a
piece
of
rich
carpet
fringed
with
gold
,
on
which
a
massive
silver
inkstand
and
materials
for
writing
were
placed
;
and
this
table
was
seized
upon
by
Lady
Lake
as
a
feature
in
her
plot
.
<EOS>
Here
she
would
have
it
<EOS>
the
confession
was
signed
by
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
Another
point
in
reference
to
this
scheme
must
not
be
passed
unnoticed
.
<EOS>
We
have
mentioned
the
heavy
hangings
at
the
lower
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
According
to
the
plotter
,
it
was
behind
these
that
Sarah
Swarton
—
the
intended
witness
of
the
imaginary
scene
—
was
concealed
.
<EOS>
The
principal
subjects
represented
on
the
arras
were
the
Judgment
of
Solomon
,
and
the
Temptation
of
our
first
Parents
in
the
Garden
by
the
Serpent
.
<EOS>
The
hangings
had
evidently
not
been
removed
for
years
,
and
did
not
reach
within
two
feet
of
the
ground
—
a
circumstance
that
had
escaped
the
attention
of
Lady
Lake
—
proving
the
truth
of
her
husband
's
observation
,
that
in
the
best
contrived
plot
some
imperfection
will
exist
certain
to
operate
in
its
detection
.
<EOS>
To
return
to
the
unhappy
Countess
.
<EOS>
So
lost
was
she
in
reflection
,
that
she
did
not
remark
Lord
Roos
's
return
till
made
aware
of
it
by
a
slight
touch
on
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
When
she
raised
her
eyes
,
they
fell
upon
an
object
that
inspired
her
with
the
dread
and
aversion
that
a
noxious
reptile
might
have
produced
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
seen
Luke
Hatton
before
;
and
if
she
had
figured
him
to
her
mind
at
all
,
it
was
not
as
anything
agreeable
;
but
she
was
not
prepared
for
so
hideous
and
revolting
a
personage
as
he
appeared
to
be
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
like
an
ugly
mask
,
on
which
a
sardonic
grin
was
stamped
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
large
and
gaunt
,
and
he
had
the
long
,
hooked
nose
,
and
the
sharp
-
pointed
bestial
ears
of
a
satyr
,
with
leering
eyes
—
betokening
at
once
sensuality
and
cunning
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
chin
and
beard
of
a
goat
,
and
crisply
-
curled
hair
of
a
pale
yellow
colour
.
<EOS>
With
all
this
,
there
was
something
sordid
in
his
looks
as
well
as
his
attire
,
which
showed
that
to
his
other
vices
he
added
that
of
avarice
.
<EOS>
A
mock
humility
,
belied
by
the
changeless
sneer
upon
his
countenance
,
distinguished
his
deportment
.
<EOS>
It
could
be
seen
at
once
that
,
however
cringing
he
might
be
,
he
despised
the
person
he
addressed
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
to
control
it
,
there
was
something
sarcastic
in
his
speech
.
<EOS>
His
doublet
and
hose
,
both
of
which
had
endured
some
service
,
and
were
well
-
nigh
threadbare
,
were
tawny
-
coloured
;
and
he
wore
a
short
yellow
cloak
,
a
great
ruff
of
the
same
colour
,
and
carried
a
brown
steeple
-
crowned
hat
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"I
await
your
ladyship
's
commands
,
"
said
Luke
Hatton
,
bowing
obsequiously
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
none
to
give
you
,
"
Lady
Exeter
rejoined
with
irrepressible
disgust
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
sent
for
you
.
<EOS>
Go
hence
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
at
all
abashed
by
this
reception
,
Luke
Hatton
maintained
his
place
,
and
threw
an
inquiring
glance
at
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
dear
Countess
,
"
said
the
young
nobleman
,
seating
himself
negligently
upon
a
tabouret
beside
her
,
"
I
must
pray
you
not
to
dismiss
this
worthy
man
so
hastily
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
him
eminently
serviceable
;
and
as
to
his
trustworthiness
,
I
have
the
best
reasons
for
feeling
satisfied
of
it
,
because
I
hold
in
my
hand
a
noose
,
which
,
whenever
I
please
,
I
can
tighten
round
his
neck
.
<EOS>
Of
this
he
is
quite
aware
,
and
therefore
he
will
serve
us
faithfully
,
as
well
from
fear
as
from
gratitude
.
<EOS>
""Her
<EOS>
ladyship
may
place
entire
confidence
in
me
,
"
remarked
Luke
Hatton
,
with
a
grin
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
not
the
first
affair
of
the
kind
in
which
I
have
been
engaged
.
<EOS>
I
have
prepared
potions
and
powders
which
Mistress
Turner
(
with
whose
reputation
your
ladyship
must
needs
be
acquainted
)
used
to
vend
to
her
customers
.
<EOS>
My
draughts
have
removed
many
a
troublesome
husband
,
and
silenced
many
a
jealous
wife
.
<EOS>
I
have
helped
many
an
heir
to
the
speedy
enjoyment
of
an
inheritance
,
which
,
but
for
my
assistance
,
would
not
have
come
to
him
for
years
.
<EOS>
The
lover
with
a
rival
in
his
way
,
who
has
come
to
me
,
has
soon
been
freed
from
all
anxiety
on
that
score
.
<EOS>
The
courtier
,
eager
for
a
post
which
a
superior
held
,
has
gained
it
by
my
aid
.
<EOS>
Yet
none
of
those
whom
I
have
thus
benefited
have
been
suspected
.
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
,
I
repeat
,
need
have
no
fears
of
me
—
and
no
scruples
with
me
.
<EOS>
State
your
wishes
,
and
they
shall
be
implicitly
obeyed
.
<EOS>
""I
have
no
wish
,
except
to
be
relieved
of
a
presence
which
is
disagreeable
to
me
,
"
replied
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
Again
Luke
Hatton
consulted
Lord
Roos
with
a
regard
.
<EOS>
"I
find
I
must
act
for
her
ladyship
,
"
said
the
young
nobleman
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
take
,
therefore
,
the
instructions
I
shall
give
you
,
as
proceeding
from
her
.
<EOS>
What
two
names
do
you
find
upon
that
paper?""Those
of
your
lordship
's
wife
and
mother
-
in
-
law
,
"
returned
Luke
Hatton
.
<EOS>
"You
comprehend
what
her
ladyship
would
have
done
with
those
persons
?
"
said
Lord
Roos
,
looking
at
him
steadfastly
.
<EOS>
"Perfectly
,
"
replied
Luke
Hatton
.
<EOS>
"O
,
do
not
give
this
fatal
order
,
my
Lord
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Lady
Exeter
,
trembling
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
many
days
do
you
require
to
effect
their
removal
?
"
demanded
Lord
Roos
,
without
appearing
to
notice
her
remark
.
<EOS>
"I
do
not
require
many
hours
,
"
replied
Luke
Hatton
;
"
but
it
will
be
well
not
to
be
too
precipitate
.
<EOS>
Neither
must
they
die
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
All
precaution
shall
be
taken
.
<EOS>
The
names
are
placed
in
a
particular
order
.
<EOS>
Is
it
so
the
Countess
would
have
them
taken
?
<EOS>
In
that
case
I
must
commence
with
Lady
Roos
.
<EOS>
""Wretch
!
<EOS>
dost
thou
dare
to
make
such
an
appeal
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Lady
Exeter
rising
.
<EOS>
"
Begone
,
instantly
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
Thou
hast
<EOS>
no
order
whatever
from
me
;
or
if
thou
fanciest
<EOS>
so
,
I
revoke
it
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
order
can
not
be
revoked
,
"
cried
Lord
Roos
,
grasping
her
arm
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
not
a
time
for
hesitation
or
repentance
.
<EOS>
Having
commenced
the
work
,
you
must
go
through
with
it
—
whether
you
will
or
not
.
<EOS>
""Whether
<EOS>
I
will
or
not
!
"
exclaimed
Lady
Exeter
,
regarding
him
with
angry
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
I
heard
you
aright
,
my
Lord
?
<EOS>
Am
I
to
be
forced
into
association
in
this
foul
deed
?
<EOS>
Have
I
sunk
so
low
in
your
esteem
that
you
venture
to
treat
me
thus?""Pardon
me
,
Frances
—
pardon
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
imploringly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
said
more
than
I
intended
.
<EOS>
If
I
appear
to
exercise
undue
influence
over
you
now
,
you
will
forgive
me
hereafter
,
because
the
situation
is
one
that
requires
decision
,
and
that
quality
I
possess
in
a
higher
degree
than
yourself
.
<EOS>
Luke
Hatton
must
obey
the
orders
given
him
.
<EOS>
And
you
must
sanction
them
.
<EOS>
""Never
!
<EOS>
"
she
exclaimed
,
emphatically
.
<EOS>
"Then
we
part
for
ever
,
"
cried
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
matter
what
the
pang
may
be
—
nor
what
befals
me
—
I
will
go
.
<EOS>
Farewell
for
ever
,
Countess!""Stay
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
not
part
thus
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
consent
?
<EOS>
"
he
exclaimed
.
"
<EOS>
Luke
Hatton
receives
his
orders
from
you?""Ask
me
not
that
question
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
with
a
shudder
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
her
ladyship
will
but
sign
this
,
"
said
Luke
Hatton
,
holding
towards
her
the
paper
on
which
the
names
were
written
,
"
it
will
suffice
for
me
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
hear
what
he
says
,
Frances
.
<EOS>
You
will
do
it
?
"
cried
Lord
Roos
.
"
<EOS>
'
Tis
but
a
few
strokes
of
a
pen
.
<EOS>
""Those
<EOS>
few
strokes
will
cost
me
my
soul
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
it
must
he
so
,
it
must

"And
<EOS>
as
Lord
Roos
complied
,
she
signed
the
paper
.
"Nov
<EOS>

may
go

said
Lord
Roos
to
Luke
Hatton

received

a
diabolical
grin

""In

said
Luke
Hatton
,
still
grinning
,
and
shifting
his
glance
from
the
half
-
fainting
Countess
to
the
young
nobleman
;
"
in

he
repeated
,
"

"And
<EOS>
with
a
cringing
bow
,
and
moving
with
a
soft
cat
-
like
footstep
,
he
quitted
the
room
,
leaving
the
guilty
pair
alone
together

<EOS>
The
execution
of
Lady
Lake
's
criminal
and
vindictive
project
would
not
have
been
long
deferred
,
after
the
defeat
she
had
sustained
from
Lord
Roos
,
but
for
her
husband
's
determined
opposition
.
<EOS>
This
may
appear
surprising
in
a
man
so
completely
under
his
wife
's
governance
as
was
Sir
Thomas
;
but
the
more
he
reflected
upon
the
possible
consequences
of
the
scheme
,
the
more
averse
to
it
he
became
;
and
finding
all
arguments
unavailing
to
dissuade
his
lady
from
her
purpose
,
he
at
last
summoned
up
resolution
enough
positively
to
interdict
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
project
was
only
deferred
,
and
not
abandoned
.
<EOS>
The
forged
confession
was
kept
in
readiness
by
Lady
Lake
for
production
on
the
first
favourable
opportunity
.
<EOS>
Not
less
disinclined
to
the
measure
than
her
father
was
Lady
Roos
,
though
the
contrary
had
been
represented
to
Sir
Thomas
by
his
lady
;
but
accustomed
to
yield
blind
obedience
to
her
mother
's
wishes
,
she
had
been
easily
worked
upon
to
acquiesce
in
the
scheme
,
especially
as
the
fabricated
confession
did
not
appear
to
hurt
her
husband
,
<EOS>
for
whom
(
though
she
did
not
dare
to
exhibit
it
)
<EOS>
she
maintained
a
deep
and
unchanging
affection
.
<EOS>
So
utterly
heart
-
broken
was
she
by
the
prolonged
and
painful
struggle
she
had
undergone
,
that
she
was
now
almost
indifferent
to
its
issue
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
her
health
had
given
way
under
the
severe
shocks
she
had
endured
;
but
all
at
once
more
dangerous
symptoms
began
to
manifest
themselves
,
and
she
became
so
greatly
indisposed
that
she
could
not
leave
her
room
.
<EOS>
Extremely
distressing
in
its
effects
,
the
attack
resembled
fever
.
<EOS>
Inextinguishable
thirst
tormented
her
;
burning
pains
;
throbbing
in
the
temples
;
and
violent
fluttering
of
the
heart
.
<EOS>
No
alleviation
of
her
sufferings
could
be
obtained
from
the
remedies
administered
by
Luke
Hatton
,
who
was
in
constant
attendance
upon
her
;
nor
will
this
be
wondered
at
,
since
we
are
in
the
secret
of
his
dark
doings
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
the
fever
increased
in
intensity
;
and
at
the
end
of
four
days
of
unremitting
agony,—witnessed
with
cynical
indifference
by
the
causer
of
the
mischief,—it
<EOS>
was
evident
that
her
case
was
desperate
.
<EOS>
From
the
first
Lady
Lake
had
been
greatly
alarmed
,
for
with
all
her
faults
she
was
an
affectionate
mother
,
though
she
had
a
strange
way
of
showing
her
affection
;
and
she
was
unremitting
in
her
attentions
to
the
sufferer
,
scarcely
ever
quitting
her
bedside
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
days
,
however
,
thus
spent
in
nursing
her
daughter
,
she
herself
succumbed
to
a
like
malady
.
<EOS>
The
same
devouring
internal
fire
scorched
her
up
,
and
raged
within
her
veins
;
the
same
unappeasable
thirst
tormented
her
;
and
unable
longer
to
fulfil
her
task
,
she
confided
it
to
Sarah
Swarton
,
and
withdrew
to
another
chamber
,
communicating
by
a
side
door
,
masked
by
drapery
,
with
that
of
Lady
Roos
.
<EOS>
Devoted
to
her
mistress
,
Sarah
Swarton
would
have
sacrificed
her
life
to
restore
her
to
health
;
and
she
cared
not
though
the
fever
might
be
infectious
.
<EOS>
The
gentleness
and
resignation
of
the
ill
-
fated
lady
,
which
failed
to
move
Luke
Hatton
,
melted
her
to
tears
;
and
it
was
with
infinite
grief
that
she
saw
her
,
day
by
day
,
sinking
slowly
but
surely
into
the
grave
.
<EOS>
To
Lady
Roos
,
the
presence
of
Sarah
Swarton
was
an
inexpressible
comfort
.
<EOS>
The
handmaiden
was
far
superior
to
her
station
,
with
a
pleasing
countenance
,
and
prepossessing
manner
,
and
possessed
of
the
soft
voice
so
soothing
to
the
ear
of
pain
.
<EOS>
But
the
chief
comfort
derived
by
Lady
Roos
from
the
society
of
Sarah
Swarton
,
was
the
power
of
unbosoming
herself
to
her
respecting
her
husband
,
and
of
pouring
her
sorrows
into
a
sympathising
ear
.
<EOS>
Lord
Roos
had
never
been
near
his
wife
since
her
seizure
—
nor
,
that
she
could
learn
,
had
made
any
inquiries
about
her
;
but
notwithstanding
his
heartless
conduct
,
her
great
desire
was
to
behold
him
once
more
before
she
died
,
and
to
breathe
some
last
words
into
his
ear
;
and
she
urged
the
wish
so
strongly
upon
her
confidante
,
that
the
latter
promised
,
if
possible
,
to
procure
its
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
A
week
had
now
nearly
elapsed
—
the
fatal
term
appointed
by
Luke
Hatton
—
and
it
could
be
no
longer
doubted
that
,
if
the
last
gratification
sought
by
Lady
Roos
were
to
be
afforded
her
,
it
must
not
be
delayed
.
<EOS>
The
poor
sufferer
was
wasted
to
a
skeleton
;
her
cheeks
hollow
;
eyes
sunk
in
deep
cavities
,
though
the
orbs
were
unnaturally
bright
;
and
her
frame
so
debilitated
,
that
she
could
scarcely
raise
herself
from
the
pillow
.
<EOS>
Sarah
Swarton
accordingly
resolved
to
set
out
upon
her
errand
;
but
before
doing
so
,
she
sought
an
interview
with
Lady
Lake
,
for
the
purpose
of
revealing
certain
fearful
suspicions
she
had
begun
to
entertain
of
Luke
Hatton
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
done
this
before
,
but
there
was
almost
insuperable
difficulty
in
obtaining
a
few
words
in
private
of
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
The
apothecary
was
continually
passing
from
room
to
room
,
hovering
nigh
the
couches
of
his
patients
,
as
if
afraid
of
leaving
them
for
a
moment
,
and
he
seemed
to
regard
Sarah
herself
with
distrust
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
now
gone
forth
,
and
she
resolved
to
take
advantage
of
his
absence
to
make
her
communication
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
II.Counter
-
Poison
.
<EOS>
The
physical
tortures
endured
by
Lady
Lake
were
exceeded
by
her
mental
anguish
.
<EOS>
While
the
poison
raged
within
her
veins
,
the
desire
of
vengeance
inflamed
her
breast
;
and
her
fear
was
lest
she
should
expire
without
gratifying
it
.
<EOS>
Bitterly
did
she
now
upbraid
herself
for
having
delayed
her
vindictive
project
.
<EOS>
More
than
once
she
consulted
Luke
Hatton
as
he
stood
beside
her
couch
,
with
the
habitual
sneer
upon
his
lips
,
watching
the
progress
of
his
own
infernal
work
,
as
to
the
possibility
of
renovating
her
strength
,
if
only
for
an
hour
,
in
order
that
she
might
strike
the
blow
.
<EOS>
But
he
shook
his
head
,
and
bade
her
wait
.
<EOS>
Wait
,
however
,
she
would
not
,
and
she
became
at
length
so
impatient
,
that
he
agreed
to
make
the
experiment
,
telling
her
he
would
prepare
a
draught
which
should
stimulate
her
into
new
life
for
a
short
time
,
but
he
would
not
answer
for
the
after
consequences
.
<EOS>
This
was
enough
.
<EOS>
She
eagerly
grasped
at
the
offer
.
<EOS>
Revenge
must
be
had
,
cost
what
it
would
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
to
prepare
the
potion
which
was
to
effect
her
brief
cure
that
Luke
Hatton
had
quitted
her
chamber
,
and
left
the
coast
clear
for
Sarah
Swarton
.
<EOS>
Startled
by
the
abrupt
entrance
and
looks
of
the
handmaiden
,
Lady
Lake
anxiously
inquired
if
all
was
well
with
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
well
as
it
,
seems
ever
likely
to
be
with
her
,
my
lady
,
"
replied
Sarah
Swarton
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
somewhat
easier
now
.
<EOS>
But
has
your
ladyship
courage
to
listen
to
what
I
have
to
tell
you?""Have
<EOS>
I
ever
shown
want
of
courage
,
Sarah
,
that
you
should
put
such
a
question
?
<EOS>
"
rejoined
Lady
Lake
,
sharply
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
this
is
something
frightful
,
my
lady
.
<EOS>
""Then
do
not
hesitate
to
disclose
it
.
<EOS>
""Has
<EOS>
your
ladyship
never
thought
it
a
strange
illness
by
which
you
and
my
Lady
Roos
have
been
seized
?
"
said
Sarah
,
coming
close
up
to
her
,
and
speaking
in
a
low
,
hurried
tone
,
as
if
afraid
of
being
overheard
,
or
interrupted
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
should
I
think
it
strange
,
Sarah
?
"
returned
Lady
Lake
,
regarding
her
fixedly
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
dreadful
and
infectious
fever
which
I
have
taken
from
my
daughter
;
and
that
is
the
reason
why
Sir
Thomas
,
and
all
others
,
except
Luke
Hatton
and
yourself
,
are
forbidden
to
come
near
us
.
<EOS>
What
we
should
have
done
without
you
,
Sarah
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
,
for
Luke
Hatton
tells
me
the
rest
of
the
household
shun
us
as
they
would
a
pestilence
.
<EOS>
I
trust
you
will
escape
the
disorder
,
and
if
I
am
spared
your
devotion
shall
be
adequately
requited
.
<EOS>
As
to
Luke
Hatton
,
he
seems
to
have
no
fear
of
it
.
<EOS>
""He
has
no
reason
to
be
afraid
,
"
replied
Sarah
,
significantly
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
no
fever
,
my
lady
.
""How
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"
Would
you
set
up
your
ignorance
against
the
skill
and
science
of
Luke
Hatton
?
<EOS>
Or
do
you
mean
to
insinuate—""I
insinuate
nothing
,
<EOS>
my
lady
,
"
interrupted
Sarah
;
"
but
I
beseech
you
to
bear
with
fortitude
the
disclosure
I
am
about
to
make
to
you
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
my
lady
,
I
am
as
certain
as
I
am
of
standing
here
,
that
poison
has
been
administered
both
to
you
and
to
my
Lady
Roos
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
terrible
communication
,
a
mortal
sickness
came
over
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
Thick
damps
gathered
upon
her
brow
,
and
she
fixed
her
haggard
eyes
upon
Sarah
.
"Poisoned
!
<EOS>
"
she
muttered
;
"
poisoned
!
<EOS>
If
so
,
there
is
but
one
person
who
can
have
done
it
—
but
one
—
except
yourself
,
Sarah!""If
<EOS>
I
had
committed
the
crime
,
should
I
have
come
hither
to
warn
you
,
my
lady
?
"
rejoined
Sarah
.
<EOS>
"Then
it
must
be
Luke
Hatton
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
"
replied
Sarah
,
looking
round
anxiously
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
he
.
<EOS>
When
he
did
not
think
I
noticed
him
,
I
chanced
to
see
him
pour
a
few
drops
from
a
phial
into
the
drink
he
prepares
for
your
ladyship
and
my
Lady
Roos
;
and
my
suspicions
being
aroused
by
his
manner
as
much
as
by
the
circumstance
,
I
watched
him
narrowly
,
and
found
that
this
proceeding
was
repeated
with
every
draught
;
with
this
difference
merely
,
that
the
dose
was
increased
in
strength
by
one
additional
drop
;
the
potion
administered
to
your
ladyship
being
some
degrees
less
powerful
than
that
given
to
my
dear
lady
,
and
no
doubt
being
intended
to
be
slower
in
its
effects
.
<EOS>
That
it
was
poison
,
I
am
certain
,
since
I
have
tested
it
upon
myself
,
by
sipping
a
small
quantity
of
the
liquid
;
and
I
had
reason
to
repent
my
rashness
,
for
I
soon
perceived
I
had
the
same
symptoms
of
illness
as
those
which
distress
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
did
you
not
caution
me
sooner
,
Sarah
?
"
said
Lady
Lake
,
horror
-
stricken
by
this
narration
.
<EOS>
"I
could
not
do
so
,
my
lady
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
only
yesterday
that
I
arrived
at
a
positive
certainty
in
the
matter
,
and
after
my
imprudence
in
tasting
the
drink
,
I
was
very
ill
—
<EOS>
indeed
I
am
scarcely
well
yet
;
and
,
to
tell
truth
,
I
was
afraid
of
Luke
Hatton
,
as
I
am
sure
he
would
make
away
with
me
,
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
if
he
fancied
I
had
discovered
his
secret
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
hope
he
will
not
come
back
and
find
me
here
.
<EOS>
""Who
can
have
prompted
him
to
the
deed
?
"
<EOS>
muttered
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"
But
why
ask
,
since
I
know
my
enemies
,
and
therefore
know
his
employers
!
<EOS>
Not
a
moment
must
be
lost
,
Sarah
.
<EOS>
Let
Sir
Thomas
Lake
be
summoned
to
me
immediately
.
<EOS>
If
he
be
at
Theobalds
,
at
Greenwich
,
or
Windsor
,
let
messengers
be
sent
after
him
,
praying
him
to
use
all
possible
dispatch
in
coming
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
yet
decide
what
I
will
do
,
but
it
shall
be
something
terrible
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
I
could
once
more
confront
the
guilty
pair
!
<EOS>
And
I
will
do
it
—
I
will
do
it
!
<EOS>
Revenge
will
give
me
strength
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
undertake
to
bring
the
Countess
hither
,
my
lady
,
"
said
Sarah
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
may
now
venture
to
inform
you
that
I
am
charged
with
a
message
from
my
dear
lady
to
her
cruel
husband
,
with
which
I
am
persuaded
he
will
comply
,
and
come
to
her
.
<EOS>
""Lure
<EOS>
him
hither
,
and
speedily
,
by
any
means
you
can
,
Sarah
,
"
rejoined
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"
Before
you
go
,
help
to
raise
me
from
my
couch
,
and
place
me
in
that
chair
.
<EOS>
It
is
well
,
"
she
cried
,
as
her
wishes
were
complied
with
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
feel
so
feeble
as
I
expected
.
<EOS>
I
was
sure
revenge
would
give
me
strength
.
<EOS>
Now
give
me
my
black
velvet
robe
,
and
my
coif
.
<EOS>
Even
in
this
extremity
I
would
only
appear
as
beseems
me
.
<EOS>
And
hark
ye
,
Sarah
,
open
that
drawer
,
and
take
out
the
weapon
you
will
find
within
it
.
<EOS>
Do
as
I
bid
you
quickly
,
wench
.
<EOS>
I
may
need
it
.
<EOS>
""Here
<EOS>
it
is
,
my
lady
,
"
replied
Sarah
,
taking
out
a
dagger
,
and
giving
it
to
Lady
Lake
,
who
immediately
concealed
it
in
the
folds
of
her
robe
.
<EOS>
"Now
<EOS>
go
<EOS>
,
"
pursued
the
lady
;
"
I
am
fully
prepared
.
<EOS>
Let
not
a
moment
be
lost
in
what
you
have
to
do
.
<EOS>
Do
not
give
any
alarm
.
<EOS>
But
bid
two
of
the
trustiest
of
the
household
hold
themselves
in
readiness
without
,
and
if
I
strike
upon
the
bell
to
rush
in
upon
the
instant
.
<EOS>
Or
if
Luke
Hatton
should
come
forth
,
let
him
be
detained
.
<EOS>
You
understand?""Perfectly
,
my
lady
,
"
replied
Sarah
,
"
and
I
make
no
doubt
they
will
obey
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
it
has
only
been
Luke
Hatton
who
,
by
his
false
representations
,
has
kept
them
away
,
and
I
will
remove
the
impression
he
has
produced
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
explain
more
than
is
needful
at
present
,
"
said
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"
We
know
not
precisely
how
this
plot
may
have
been
laid
,
and
must
take
its
authors
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
You
were
once
more
intimate
than
I
liked
with
that
Spanish
knave
,
Diego
.
<EOS>
Breathe
not
a
word
to
him
,
or
all
will
be
repeated
to
his
master
.
<EOS>
""Rest
<EOS>
assured
I
will
be
careful
,
my
lady
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
nothing
whatever
of
Diego
of
late
,
and
care
not
if
I
never
behold
him
again
.
<EOS>
But
what
is
to
happen
to
my
dear
lady?""Leave
her
to
me
,
"
replied
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
yet
to
be
able
to
save
her
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
here
comes
the
villain
.
<EOS>
Away
with
you
,
Sarah
,
and
see
that
my
orders
are
obeyed
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
handmaiden
did
not
require
the
command
to
be
repeated
,
but
hastily
quitted
the
room
,
casting
a
terrified
look
at
the
apothecary
,
who
entered
it
at
the
same
moment
.
<EOS>
Luke
Hatton
appeared
greatly
surprised
on
finding
Lady
Lake
risen
from
her
couch
,
and
could
not
help
exclaiming
,
as
he
quickly
advanced
towards
her—"You
up
,
my
lady
!
<EOS>
This
is
very
imprudent
,
and
may
defeat
my
plans
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
doubt
you
think
so
,
"
rejoined
Lady
Lake
;
"
but
knowing
you
would
oppose
my
inclination
,
I
got
Sarah
to
lift
me
from
the
couch
,
and
tire
me
during
your
absence
.
<EOS>
Have
you
prepared
the
mixture?""I
have
,
my
lady
,
"
he
replied
,
producing
a
small
phial
.
<EOS>
"Give
<EOS>
it
me
<EOS>
,
"
she
cried
,
taking
it
from
him
.
<EOS>
After
examining
the
pale
yellow
fluid
it
contained
for
a
moment
,
she
took
out
the
glass
stopper
,
and
,
smelling
at
it
,
perceived
it
to
be
a
very
subtle
and
volatile
spirit
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
this
poison
?
<EOS>
"
she
demanded
,
fixing
her
eyes
keenly
upon
Luke
Hatton
.
<EOS>
"On
<EOS>
the
contrary
,
my
lady
,
"
he
replied
,
without
expressing
any
astonishment
at
the
question
,
"
it
would
be
an
antidote
to
almost
any
poison
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
rarest
cordial
that
can
be
prepared
,
and
the
secret
of
its
composition
is
only
known
to
myself
.
<EOS>
When
I
said
your
ladyship
would
incur
great
risk
in
taking
it
,
I
meant
that
the
reaction
from
so
powerful
a
stimulant
would
be
highly
dangerous
.
<EOS>
But
you
declared
you
did
not
heed
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
""Nor
<EOS>
do
I
,
"
she
rejoined
.
"
<EOS>
Yet
I
would
see
it
tasted
.
<EOS>
""Your
mind
shall
be
made
easy
on
that
score
in
a
moment
,
my
lady
,
"
said
Luke
Hatton
.
<EOS>
And
taking
a
small
wine
-
glass
that
stood
by
,
he
rinsed
it
with
water
and
carefully
wiped
it
;
after
which
he
poured
a
few
drops
of
the
liquid
into
it
and
swallowed
them
.
<EOS>
During
this
proceeding
Lady
Lake
's
gaze
never
quitted
him
for
a
second
.
<EOS>
Apparently
satisfied
with
the
test
,
she
bade
him
return
the
phial
to
her
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
had
better
let
me
pour
it
out
for
you
,
my
lady
,
"
he
replied
,
cleansing
the
glass
as
before
.
<EOS>
"
The
quantity
must
be
exactly
observed
.
<EOS>
Twenty
drops
,
and
no
more
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
hand
is
as
steady
as
your
own
,
and
I
can
count
the
drops
as
accurately
,
"
she
rejoined
,
taking
the
phial
from
him
.
"
<EOS>
Twenty
,
you
say?""Twenty
,
my
lady
,
"
rejoined
Hatton
,
evidently
displeased
;
"
but
perhaps
you
had
better
confine
yourself
to
fifteen
,
or
even
ten
.
'
<EOS>
T
will
be
safer
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
think
the
larger
dose
might
give
me
too
much
strength
—
ha
!
<EOS>
What
say
you
to
fifty
,
or
a
hundred?""It
must
not
be
,
my
lady
—
it
must
not
be
.
<EOS>
You
will
destroy
yourself
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
duty
to
prevent
you
.
<EOS>
I
must
insist
upon
your
giving
me
back
the
phial
,
unless
you
will
consent
to
obey
my
orders
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
man
,
I
will
have
a
hundred
drops
of
the
cordial
,
"
she
cried
pertinaciously
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
I
say
you
shall
not
,
my
lady
,
"
he
rejoined
,
unable
in
his
anger
to
maintain
the
semblance
of
respect
he
had
hitherto
preserved
,
and
endeavouring
to
obtain
forcible
possession
of
the
phial
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
too
quick
for
him
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
stretched
out
his
hand
for
the
purpose
,
the
dagger
gleamed
before
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"Back
,
miscreant
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
;
"
your
over
-
eagerness
has
betrayed
you
.
<EOS>
I
now
fully
believe
what
I
have
hitherto
doubted
,
that
this
is
a
counter
-
poison
,
and
that
I
may
safely
use
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
time
to
unmask
you
,
and
to
let
you
know
that
your
villanies
are
discovered
.
<EOS>
I
am
aware
of
the
malignant
practices
you
have
resorted
to
,
and
that
my
daughter
and
myself
would
have
been
destroyed
by
your
poisonous
preparations
.
<EOS>
But
I
now
feel
some
security
in
the
antidote
I
have
obtained
;
and
if
I
do
perish
<EOS>
I
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
I
shall
not
die
unavenged
,
but
that
certain
punishment
awaits
you
and
your
employers
.
<EOS>
"On
<EOS>
this
she
poured
out
half
the
contents
of
the
phial
into
the
glass
,
saying
as
she
drank
it
<EOS>
,
"
I
reserve
the
other
half
for
Lady
Roos
.
<EOS>
"Luke
<EOS>
Hatton
,
who
appeared
thunder
-
stricken
,
made
no
further
effort
to
prevent
her
,
but
turned
to
fly
.
<EOS>
Lady
Lake
,
however
,
upon
whom
the
restorative
effect
of
the
cordial
was
almost
magical
,
ordered
him
to
stay
,
telling
him
if
he
went
forth
he
would
be
arrested
,
on
hearing
which
he
sullenly
obeyed
her
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
have
not
deceived
me
as
to
the
efficacy
of
the
potion
,
"
said
the
lady
;
"
it
has
given
me
new
life
,
and
with
returning
vigour
I
can
view
all
things
as
I
viewed
them
heretofore
.
<EOS>
Now
mark
what
I
have
to
say
,
villain
.
<EOS>
You
have
placed
me
and
my
daughter
in
fearful
jeopardy
;
but
it
is
in
your
power
to
make
reparation
for
the
injury
;
and
as
I
hold
you
to
be
a
mere
instrument
in
the
matter
,
I
am
willing
to
spare
the
life
you
have
forfeited
,
on
condition
of
your
making
a
full
confession
in
writing
of
your
attempt
,
to
be
'
used
by
me
against
your
employers
.
<EOS>
Are
you
willing
to
do
this
,
or
shall
I
strike
upon
the
bell
,
and
have
you
bound
hand
and
foot
,
and
conveyed
to
the
Gatehouse?""I
will
write
that
I
was
employed
by
the
Countess
of
Exeter
to
poison
you
and
my
Lady
Roos
,
"
replied
Luke
Hatton
,
stubbornly
;
"
but
I
will
do
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
""That
will
suffice
,
"
replied
Lady
Lake
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
when
I
have
done
it
,
I
shall
be
free
to
go
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"You
shall
be
free
to
go
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
There
were
writing
materials
on
an
adjoining
table
,
and
,
without
another
word
,
Luke
Hatton
sat
down
,
and
with
great
expedition
drew
up
a
statement
which
he
signed
,
and
handed
to
Lady
Lake
;
asking
if
that
was
what
she
required?A
smile
lighted
up
her
ghastly
features
as
she
perused
it
.
<EOS>
"It
will
do
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
now
answer
me
one
question
,
and
you
are
free
.
<EOS>
Will
this
cordial
have
the
same
effect
on
my
daughter
as
on
me?""Precisely
the
same
.
<EOS>
It
will
cure
her
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
proceed
more
cautiously
.
<EOS>
Were
she
to
take
the
quantity
you
have
taken
,
it
would
kill
her
.
<EOS>
Am
I
now
at
liberty
to
depart?""You
are
,
"
replied
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
So
saying
,
she
struck
the
bell
,
and
immediately
afterwards
the
door
was
opened
;
not
,
however
,
by
the
attendants
,
but
by
Sir
Thomas
Lake
.
<EOS>
As
the
Secretary
of
State
perceived
that
the
apothecary
avoided
him
,
and
would
have
passed
forth
quickly
,
he
sternly
and
authoritatively
commanded
him
to
stay
,
exclaiming
,
"
You
stir
not
hence
,
till
you
have
accounted
to
me
for
my
daughter
,
who
,
I
understand
,
is
dying
from
your
pernicious
treatment
.
<EOS>
What
ho
,
there
!
<EOS>
Keep
strict
watch
without
;
and
suffer
not
this
man
to
pass
forth!"CHAPTER
III.Showing
that
"
our
pleasant
vicesare
made
the
whips
to
scourge
us
.
"We
<EOS>
must
now
request
the
reader
to
visit
the
noble
mansion
in
the
Strand
,
erected
by
Thomas
Cecil
,
then
Earl
of
Exeter
,
and
bearing
-
his
name
;
in
a
chamber
of
which
Lord
Roos
and
the
Countess
of
Exeter
will
be
found
alone
together
—
alone
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
Very
different
was
the
deportment
of
the
guilty
pair
towards
each
other
from
what
it
used
to
be
.
<EOS>
The
glances
they
exchanged
were
no
longer
those
of
passionate
love
,
but
of
undissembled
hatred
.
<EOS>
Bitter
reproaches
had
been
uttered
on
one
side
,
angry
menaces
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
the
fatal
order
had
been
wrested
from
the
Countess
,
her
peace
of
mind
had
been
entirely
destroyed
,
and
she
had
become
a
prey
to
all
the
horrors
of
remorse
.
<EOS>
Perceiving
the
change
in
her
sentiments
towards
him
,
Lord
Roos
strove
,
by
the
arts
which
had
hitherto
proved
so
successful
,
to
win
back
the
place
he
had
lost
in
her
affections
;
but
failing
in
doing
so
,
and
irritated
by
her
reproaches
,
and
still
more
by
her
coldness
,
he
gave
vent
to
his
displeasure
in
terms
that
speedily
produced
a
decided
quarrel
between
them
;
and
though
reconciled
in
appearance
,
they
never
again
were
to
each
other
what
they
had
been
.
<EOS>
As
this
was
to
be
their
final
meeting
,
they
had
agreed
not
to
embitter
it
with
unavailing
reproaches
and
recriminations
.
<EOS>
Lord
Roos
acquainted
the
Countess
that
he
had
decided
upon
travelling
into
Italy
and
Spain
,
and
remaining
abroad
for
a
lengthened
period
;
and
the
announcement
of
his
intention
was
received
by
her
without
an
objection
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
hoped
that
when
put
to
this
trial
she
might
relent
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
he
was
disappointed
.
<EOS>
She
even
urged
him
not
to
delay
his
departure
,
and
concluded
her
speech
with
these
words—"Something
tells
me
we
shall
meet
no
more
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
But
we
are
certain
to
meet
hereafter
at
the
Judgment
Seat
.
<EOS>
How
shall
we
regard
each
other
then?""Trouble
me
not
with
the
question
,
"
rejoined
Lord
Roos
gloomily
;
"
I
have
not
come
here
to
listen
to
sermons
,
and
will
brook
no
more
reproaches
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
mean
to
reproach
you
,
William
,
"
she
returned
meekly
;
"
but
the
thought
of
our
dire
offence
rises
perpetually
before
me
.
<EOS>
Would
we
could
undo
what
we
have
<EOS>
done!""I
tell
you
it
is
too
late
,
"
rejoined
Lord
Roos
harshly
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Diego
suddenly
presented
himself
,
and
apologizing
for
the
abruptness
of
his
entrance
,
accounted
for
it
by
saying
that
Sarah
Swarton
besought
a
word
with
his
Lordship
.
<EOS>
She
brought
a
message
,
he
added
,
from
Lady
Roos
,
who
was
much
worse
,
and
not
finding
his
Lordship
at
his
own
residence
had
ventured
to
follow
him
to
Exeter
House
to
deliver
it
.
<EOS>
"I
will
come
to
her
anon
,
"
said
Lord
Roos
carelessly
.
<EOS>
"No
,
<EOS>
no
;
admit
her
at
once
,
Diego
,
"
cried
the
Countess
;
"
I
would
hear
what
she
has
to
say
.
"
And
the
next
moment
Sarah
Swarton
being
ushered
into
the
room
,
she
rushed
up
to
her
and
eagerly
demanded
,
"
How
fares
it
with
your
lady
?
<EOS>
Is
there
any
hope
for
her?""None
<EOS>
whatever
,
"
replied
Sarah
,
shaking
her
head
sadly
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
past
all
chance
of
recovery
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
Heaven
pardon
me
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
the
Countess
,
clasping
her
hands
together
,
and
falling
upon
her
knees
.
<EOS>
Sarah
Swarton
gazed
at
her
in
astonishment
;
while
Lord
Roos
,
rushing
towards
her
,
commanded
her
to
rise
.
<EOS>
"Take
<EOS>
heed
what
you
say
and
do
,
Countess
,
"
he
whispered
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
excite
this
woman
's
suspicions
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
should
your
ladyship
implore
Heaven
's
pardon
because
my
poor
dear
lady
is
near
her
end
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sarah
.
<EOS>
"I
sue
for
it
because
I
have
caused
her
much
affliction
,
"
replied
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
"Your
message
,
Sarah
—
your
message
?
"
interposed
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
to
say
to
me?""My
lady
desires
to
see
you
once
more
before
she
expires
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Sarah
.
<EOS>
"
She
would
take
leave
of
you
;
and
—
and
—
she
has
something
to
impart
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
refuse
her
last
request?""He
<EOS>
will
not
—
he
will
not
,
I
am
sure
,
"
cried
the
Countess
,
seeing
him
look
irresolute
.
<EOS>
"I
did
not
expect
to
be
seconded
by
you
,
my
lady
,
"
observed
Sarah
,
in
increasing
surprise
.
<EOS>
"Would
<EOS>
that
I
,
too
,
might
see
her
and
obtain
her
forgiveness
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
Countess
,
without
heeding
the
remark
.
<EOS>
"An
<EOS>
idle
wish
,
and
not
to
be
indulged
,
"
said
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
A
sudden
idea
appeared
to
strike
Sarah
,
and
she
cried
,
"
Your
ladyship
's
desire
may
possibly
be
gratified
.
<EOS>
My
poor
lady
desires
to
part
in
peace
with
all
the
world
,
even
with
those
who
have
injured
her
.
<EOS>
I
will
communicate
your
wishes
to
her
,
and
it
may
be
she
will
consent
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
shall
have
a
reward
well
worthy
of
the
service
if
you
accomplish
it
,
"
said
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hasten
to
her
with
all
speed
,
my
Lord
,
and
I
will
follow
in
my
litter
,
ready
to
attend
Sarah
's
summons
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
like
not
the
plan
,
"
rejoined
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
wrong
to
go
.
<EOS>
Why
need
you
see
her?""Why
?
<EOS>
"
she
answered
,
regarding
him
fixedly
.
"
<EOS>
Because
it
may
be
some
little
consolation
to
me
afterwards
.
<EOS>
""Then
go
alone
,
"
said
Lord
Roos
savagely
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
accompany
you
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
ask
you
to
accompany
me
,
but
to
precede
me
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
mark
me
,
my
Lord
,
"
she
added
in
a
low
,
firm
tone
,
"
and
be
assured
I
do
not
advance
more
than
I
will
perform
.
<EOS>
If
you
refuse
your
wife
's
dying
request
,
I
will
go
back
with
Sarah
and
confess
all
to
her
.
<EOS>
"Lord
<EOS>
Roos
looked
as
if
he
could
have
annihilated
her
,
and
muttered
a
terrible
imprecation
on
her
head
.
<EOS>
"Threaten
<EOS>
me
—
ay
,
and
execute
your
threats
hereafter
if
you
will
<EOS>
,
"
continued
the
Countess
in
the
same
low
decided
tone
,
"
but
go
you
shallnow
.
<EOS>
"Her
<EOS>
manner
was
so
irresistible
that
Lord
Roos
was
compelled
to
obey
,
and
he
quitted
the
room
without
a
word
more
,
followed
by
Diego
and
Sarah
Swarton
,
the
latter
of
whom
signed
to
the
Countess
that
she
might
depend
upon
the
fulfilment
of
her
wishes
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
been
gone
many
minutes
before
Lady
Exeter
entered
her
litter
,
and
wholly
unattended
by
page
or
serving
-
man
,
except
those
in
charge
of
the
conveyance
,
caused
herself
to
be
conveyed
to
Sir
Thomas
Lake
's
lodgings
in
Whitehall

CHAPTER
IV.How
the
forged
Confession
was
produced
.
<EOS>
Summoning
up
all
his
firmness
for
the
interview
with
his
lady
,
Lord
Roos
entered
her
chamber
,
attended
by
Sarah
Swarton
,
and
beheld
her
propped
up
by
pillows
,
bearing
evident
marks
in
her
countenance
of
the
severe
sufferings
she
had
endured
.
<EOS>
She
was
emaciated
in
frame
,
and
almost
livid
in
complexion
;
hollow
-
cheeked
and
hollow
-
eyed
;
but
still
with
a
look
of
unaltered
affection
for
him
.
<EOS>
Having
fulfilled
her
mission
,
Sarah
left
them
alone
together
.
<EOS>
He
took
the
thin
fingers
extended
towards
him
,
and
pressed
them
to
his
lips
,
but
scarcely
dared
to
raise
his
eyes
towards
his
wife
,
so
much
was
he
shocked
by
her
appearance
.
<EOS>
It
was
with
difficulty
she
gave
utterance
to
the
words
she
addressed
to
him
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
thank
you
for
coming
to
me
,
my
Lord
,
"
she
said
;
"
<EOS>
but
you
will
not
regret
your
kindness
.
<EOS>
We
are
quite
alone
,
are
we
not
?
<EOS>
My
eyes
are
so
dim
that
I
can
not
distinguish
any
object
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
—
<EOS>
but
I
can
see
you
plainly
enough
,
my
dear
Lord
.
<EOS>
""We
are
alone
,
Elizabeth
,
"
replied
Lord
Roos
,
in
a
voice
of
some
emotion
,
after
glancing
around
.
<EOS>
"Then
I
may
speak
freely
,
"
she
continued
.
<EOS>
"
What
I
predicted
has
occurred
.
<EOS>
You
did
not
do
well
,
my
dear
Lord
,
to
take
that
phial
from
me
and
place
it
in
other
hands
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
start
not
!
<EOS>
I
know
I
am
poisoned
:
I
have
known
it
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
made
no
effort
to
save
myself
,
for
I
was
aware
it
was
your
will
<EOS>
I
should
die
.
<EOS>
""O
,
Elizabeth
!
<EOS>
"
murmured
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"I
was
aware
of
it
,
"
she
repeated
;
"
and
as
I
have
never
voluntarily
disobeyed
you
,
I
would
not
now
thwart
your
purpose
,
even
though
I
myself
must
be
the
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
tell
you
this
that
I
have
sent
for
you
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
forgive
—
to
bless
you
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
as
she
spoke
she
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
,
and
he
felt
his
cheek
wet
with
her
tears
.
<EOS>
"This
is
more
than
I
can
bear
,
"
cried
Lord
Roos
,
in
a
voice
suffocated
by
emotion
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
had
firmness
for
anything
;
but
it
deserts
me
entirely
now
.
<EOS>
You
are
an
angel
of
goodness
,
Elizabeth
;
as
I
am
a
demon
of
darkness
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
deserve
your
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
""You
will
deserve
it
,
if
you
will
comply
with
the
request
I
am
about
to
make
to
you
,
"
she
rejoined
,
looking
at
him
beseechingly
.
<EOS>
"Whatever
<EOS>
it
be
it
shall
be
granted
,
if
in
my
power
,
"
he
rejoined
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
redeem
your
life
,
if
I
could
,
at
the
price
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
You
have
exorcised
the
evil
spirit
from
me
,
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
I
shall
die
happy
,
"
she
replied
,
with
a
smile
of
ineffable
delight
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
the
request
!
<EOS>
What
is
it
you
would
have
me
perform
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"I
would
have
you
spare
my
mother
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
she
has
been
dealt
with
in
the
same
way
as
myself
;
but
I
also
know
there
is
yet
time
to
save
her
.
<EOS>
""It
shall
be
done
,
"
said
Lord
Roos
,
emphatically
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
is
she?""In
the
adjoining
chamber
.
<EOS>
""Is
Luke
Hatton
in
attendance
upon
her?""In
constant
attendance
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
man
has
obeyed
you
well
,
my
Lord
.
<EOS>
But
take
heed
of
him
:
he
is
a
dangerous
weapon
,
and
may
injure
the
hand
that
employs
him
.
<EOS>
Strike
gently
upon
that
bell
.
<EOS>
He
will
attend
the
summons
.
<EOS>
"Lord
<EOS>
Roos
complied
;
when
,
to
his
astonishment
and
dismay
,
the
curtains
shrouding
the
entrance
to
the
adjoining
room
were
drawn
aside
,
and
Lady
Lake
stalked
from
behind
them
.
<EOS>
Never
before
had
she
surveyed
her
son
-
in
-
law
with
such
a
glance
of
triumph
as
she
threw
upon
him
now
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
were
mistaken
<EOS>
you
see
,
Elizabeth
,
"
said
Lord
Roos
to
his
lady
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
mother
needs
no
aid
.
<EOS>
She
is
perfectly
well
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
well
enough
to
confound
you
and
all
your
wicked
purposes
,
my
Lord
,
"
cried
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
accomplished
my
destruction
,
as
you
perceive
;
nor
shall
you
accomplish
your
wife
's
destruction
,
though
you
have
well
-
nigh
succeeded
.
<EOS>
Let
it
chafe
you
to
madness
to
learn
that
I
possess
an
antidote
,
which
I
have
myself
approved
,
and
which
will
kill
the
poison
circling
in
her
veins
,
and
give
her
new
life
.
<EOS>
""An
antidote
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Lord
Roos
.
"
<EOS>
So
far
from
galling
me
to
madness
,
the
intelligence
fills
me
with
delight
beyond
expression
.
<EOS>
Give
it
me
,
Madam
,
that
I
may
administer
it
at
once
;
and
heaven
grant
its
results
may
be
such
as
you
predict!""Administered
by
you
,
my
Lord
,
it
would
be
poison
,
"
said
Lady
Lake
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
may
stand
by
and
witness
its
beneficial
effects
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
instantaneous
.
<EOS>
""As
<EOS>
you
will
,
Madam
<EOS>
,
so
you
do
not
delay
the
application
,
"
cried
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
"Drink
<EOS>
of
this
,
my
child
,
"
said
Lady
Lake
,
after
she
had
poured
some
drops
of
the
cordial
into
a
glass
.
<EOS>
"I
will
take
it
from
no
hand
but
my
husband
's
,
"
murmured
Lady
Roos
.
"How
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
her
mother
,
frowning
.
<EOS>
"Give
it
me
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
Madam
,
"
cried
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
"
Is
this
a
time
for
hesitation
,
when
you
see
her
life
hangs
upon
a
thread
,
which
you
yourself
may
sever?"And
taking
the
glass
from
her
,
he
held
it
to
his
wife
's
lips
;
tenderly
supporting
her
while
she
swallowed
its
contents
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
long
before
the
effects
of
the
cordial
were
manifest
.
<EOS>
The
deathly
hue
of
the
skin
changed
to
a
more
healthful
colour
,
and
the
pulsations
of
the
heart
became
stronger
and
more
equal
;
and
though
the
debility
could
not
be
so
speedily
repaired
,
it
was
apparent
that
the
work
of
restoration
had
commenced
,
and
might
be
completed
if
the
same
treatment
were
pursued
.
<EOS>
"Now
<EOS>
I
owe
my
life
to
you
,
my
dear
Lord
,
"
said
Lady
Roos
,
regarding
her
husband
with
grateful
fondness
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
him
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
her
mother
.
<EOS>
"
You
owe
him
nothing
but
a
heavy
debt
of
vengeance
,
which
we
will
endeavour
to
pay
,
and
with
interest
.
<EOS>
But
keep
calm
,
my
child
,
and
do
not
trouble
yourself
;
whatever
may
occur
.
<EOS>
Your
speedy
restoration
will
depend
much
on
that
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
do
not
adopt
the
means
to
make
me
calm
,
mother
,
"
replied
Lady
Roos
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Lake
was
too
much
bent
upon
the
immediate
and
full
gratification
of
her
long
-
deferred
vengeance
to
heed
her
.
<EOS>
Clapping
her
hands
together
,
the
signal
was
answered
by
Sir
Thomas
Lake
,
who
came
forth
from
the
adjoining
room
with
Luke
Hatton
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
and
as
if
it
had
been
so
contrived
that
all
the
guilty
parties
should
be
confronted
together
,
the
outer
door
of
the
chamber
was
opened
,
and
the
Countess
of
Exeter
was
ushered
in
by
Sarah
Swarton
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
in
whose
presence
she
stood
,
the
Countess
would
have
precipitately
retreated
;
but
it
was
too
late
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
closed
by
Sarah
.
<EOS>
"Soh
!
<EOS>
my
turn
is
come
at
last
,
"
cried
Lady
Lake
,
gazing
from
one
to
the
other
with
a
smile
of
gratified
vengeance
.
<EOS>
"
I
hold
you
all
in
my
toils
.
<EOS>
You
,
my
Lord
,
"
addressing
her
son
-
in
-
law
,
"
have
treated
a
wife
,
who
has
ever
shown
you
the
most
devoted
affection
,
with
neglect
and
cruelty
,
and
,
not
content
with
such
barbarous
treatment
,
have
conspired
against
her
life
,
and
against
my
life
.
<EOS>
""Take
<EOS>
heed
how
you
bring
any
charge
against
him
,
mother
,
"
cried
Lady
Roos
,
raising
herself
in
her
couch
.
<EOS>
"
Take
heed
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
Let
your
vengeance
fall
upon
her
head
,
"
pointing
to
the
Countess—"but
<EOS>
not
upon
him
.
<EOS>
""I
am
willing
to
make
atonement
for
the
wrongs
I
have
done
you
,
Lady
Roos
,
"
said
the
Countess
,
"
and
have
come
hither
to
say
so
,
and
to
implore
your
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
fancied
she
was
dying
,
"
rejoined
Lady
Lake—"dying
from
the
effects
of
the
poison
administered
to
her
and
to
me
by
Luke
Hatton
,
according
to
your
order
;
but
you
are
mistaken
,
Countess
.
<EOS>
We
have
found
an
antidote
,
and
shall
yet
live
to
requite
you
.
<EOS>
""It
is
more
satisfaction
to
me
to
be
told
this
,
Madam
,
than
it
would
be
to
find
that
Luke
Hatton
had
succeeded
in
his
design
,
which
I
would
have
prevented
if
I
could
,
"
said
Lady
Exeter
.
<EOS>
"You
will
gain
little
credit
for
that
assertion
,
Countess
,
"
remarked
Sir
Thomas
Lake
,
"
since
it
is
contradicted
by
an
order
which
I
hold
in
my
hand
,
signed
by
yourself
,
and
given
to
the
miscreant
in
question
.
<EOS>
""O
Heavens
!
"
ejaculated
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
"Do
you
deny
this
signature
?
"
asked
Sir
Thomas
,
showing
her
the
paper
.
<EOS>
Lady
Exeter
made
no
answer
.
"Learn
<EOS>
further
to
your
confusion
,
Countess
,
"
pursued
Lady
Lake
,
"
that
the
wretch
,
Luke
Hatton
,
has
made
a
full
confession
of
his
offence
,
wherein
he
declares
that
he
was
incited
by
you
,
and
by
you
alone
,
on
the
offer
of
a
large
reward
,
to
put
my
daughter
and
myself
to
death
by
slow
poison
.
<EOS>
""By
<EOS>
me
alone!—incited
by
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Lady
Exeter
;
"
why
,
I
opposed
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
he
can
have
confessed
thus
.
<EOS>
Hast
thou
done
so
,
villain?""I
have
,
"
replied
Luke
Hatton
,
sullenly
.
<EOS>
"Then
thou
hast
avouched
a
lie
—
a
lie
that
will
damn
thee
,
"
said
Lady
Exeter
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Roos
knows
it
to
be
false
,
and
can
exculpate
me
.
<EOS>
Speak
,
my
Lord
,
I
charge
you
,
and
say
how
it
occurred
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
the
young
nobleman
remained
silent
.
"Not
<EOS>
a
word
—
not
a
word
in
my
favour
,
"
the
Countess
exclaimed
,
in
a
voice
of
anguish
.
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
then
I
am
indeed
lost!""You
are
lost
past
redemption
,
"
cried
Lady
Lake
with
an
outburst
of
fierce
exultation
,
and
a
look
as
if
she
would
have
trampled
her
beneath
her
feet
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
forfeited
honour
,
station
,
life
.
<EOS>
Guilty
of
disloyalty
to
your
proud
and
noble
husband
,
you
have
sought
to
remove
by
violent
deaths
those
who
stood
between
you
and
your
lover
.
<EOS>
Happily
your
dreadful
purpose
has
been
defeated
;
but
this
avowal
of
your
criminality
with
Lord
Roos
,
signed
by
yourself
and
witnessed
by
his
lordship
and
his
Spanish
servant,—this
shall
be
laid
within
an
hour
before
the
Earl
of
Exeter
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
brain
turns
round
.
<EOS>
I
am
bewildered
with
all
these
frightful
accusations
,
"
exclaimed
the
Countess
distractedly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
made
no
confession,—have
signed
none
.
<EOS>
""Methought
<EOS>
you
said
I
had
witnessed
it
,
Madam
?
"
cried
Lord
Roos
,
almost
as
much
bewildered
as
Lady
Exeter
.
<EOS>
"Will
<EOS>
you
deny
your
own
handwriting
,
my
Lord
?
"
rejoined
Lady
Lake
;
"
or
will
the
Countess
?
<EOS>
Behold
the
confession
,
subscribed
by
the
one
,
and
witnessed
by
the
other
.
<EOS>
""It
is
a
forgery
!
"
shrieked
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
charged
me
with
witchcraft
;
but
you
practise
it
yourself
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
it
to
be
false
,
I
could
have
sworn
the
hand
<EOS>
was
yours
,
Countess
,
"
cried
Lord
Roos
;
"
and
my
own
signature
is
equally
skilfully
simulated
.
<EOS>
""False
or
not
,
"
cried
Lady
Lake
,
"
it
shall
be
laid
before
Lord
Exeter
as
I
have
said
—
with
all
the
details
—
ay
,
and
before
the
King
.
<EOS>
""Before
the
King
!
"
repeated
Lord
Roos
,
as
he
drew
near
Lady
Exeter
,
and
whispered
in
her
ear—"Countess
,
our
sole
safety
is
in
immediate
flight
.
<EOS>
Circumstances
are
so
strong
against
us
,
that
we
shall
never
be
able
to
disprove
this
forgery
.
<EOS>
""Then
save
yourself
in
the
way
you
propose
,
my
Lord
,
"
she
rejoined
,
with
scorn
.
"
<EOS>
For
me
,
I
shall
remain
,
and
brave
it
out
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
young
nobleman
made
a
movement
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
"You
can
not
go
forth
without
my
order
,
my
Lord
,
"
cried
Sir
Thomas
Lake
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
guarded
.
<EOS>
""Perdition
!
"
exclaimed
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
Again
Lady
Lake
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
a
smile
of
triumph
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
presently
checked
by
a
look
from
her
daughter
,
who
made
a
sign
to
her
to
approach
her
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
would
you
,
my
child?—more
of
the
cordial
?
"
demanded
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"No
,
mother
,
"
she
replied
,
in
a
tone
so
low
as
to
be
inaudible
to
the
others
.
"
<EOS>
Nor
will
I
suffer
another
drop
to
pass
my
lips
unless
my
husband
be
allowed
to
depart
without
molestation
.
<EOS>
""Would
<EOS>
you
interfere
with
my
vengeance
?
"
said
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
mother
,
I
will
interfere
with
it
effectually
unless
you
comply
,
"
rejoined
Lady
Roos
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
acquaint
the
Countess
with
the
true
nature
of
that
confession
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
she
has
awakened
by
her
conduct
some
feelings
of
pity
in
my
breast
.
<EOS>
""You
will
ruin
all
by
your
weakness
,
"
said
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
Lord
Roos
go
free
,
and
let
there
be
a
truce
between
you
and
the
Countess
for
three
days
,
and
I
am
content
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
like
to
give
such
a
promise
,
"
said
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
hard
to
keep
it
.
<EOS>
""It
may
be
harder
to
lose
all
your
vengeance
,
"
rejoined
Lady
Roos
,
in
a
tone
that
showed
she
would
not
be
opposed
.
<EOS>
Compelled
to
succumb
,
Lady
Lake
moved
towards
Sir
Thomas
,
and
a
few
words
having
passed
between
them
in
private
,
the
Secretary
of
State
thus
addressed
his
noble
son
-
in
-
law—"My
Lord
,
"
he
said
in
a
grave
tone
,
"
at
the
instance
of
my
daughter
,
though
much
against
my
own
inclination
,
and
that
of
my
wife
,
I
will
no
longer
oppose
your
departure
.
<EOS>
I
understand
you
are
about
to
travel
,
and
I
therefore
recommend
you
to
set
forth
without
delay
,
for
if
you
be
found
in
London
,
or
in
England
,
after
three
days
,
during
which
time
,
at
the
desire
also
of
our
daughter
—
and
equally
against
our
own
wishes
—
we
consent
to
keep
truce
with
my
lady
of
Exeter
;
if
,
I
say
,
you
are
found
after
that
time
,
I
will
not
answer
for
the
consequences
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
Thus
warned
,
my
Lord
,
you
are
at
liberty
to
depart
.
<EOS>
""I
will
take
advantage
of
your
offer
,
Sir
Thomas
,
and
attend
to
your
hint
,
"
replied
Lord
Roos
.
<EOS>
And
turning
upon
his
heel
,
he
marched
towards
the
door
,
whither
he
was
accompanied
by
Sir
Thomas
Lake
,
who
called
to
the
attendants
outside
to
let
him
go
free
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
one
word
of
farewell
to
me
!
<EOS>
not
one
look
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
his
wife
,
sinking
back
upon
the
pillow
.
"Nor
<EOS>
for
me
—
and
I
shall
see
him
no
more
,
"
murmured
the
Countess
,
compressing
her
beautiful
lips
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
better
thus
.
<EOS>
"While
<EOS>
this
was
passing
,
Luke
Hatton
had
contrived
to
approach
the
Countess
,
and
now
said
in
a
low
tone—"If
your
ladyship
will
trust
to
me
,
and
make
it
worth
my
while
,
I
will
deliver
you
from
the
peril
in
which
you
are
placed
by
this
confession
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
come
to
Exeter
House
to
-
night?"She
<EOS>
consented
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
what
<EOS>
hour?""At
<EOS>
midnight
,
"
she
returned
.
<EOS>
"
I
loathe
thee
,
yet
have
no
alternative
but
to
trust
thee
.
<EOS>
Am
I
free
to
depart
likewise
?
"
<EOS>
she
added
aloud
to
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
door
is
open
for
you
,
Countess
,
"
rejoined
the
Secretary
of
State
,
with
mock
ceremoniousness
.
"
<EOS>
After
three
days
,
you
understand
,
war
is
renewed
between
us
.
<EOS>
""War
<EOS>
to
the
death
,
"
subjoined
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"Be
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
so
,
"
replied
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
desert
my
post
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
assuming
the
dignified
deportment
for
which
she
was
remarkable
,
she
went
forth
with
a
slow
and
majestic
step
.
<EOS>
Luke
Hatton
would
have
followed
her
,
but
Sir
Thomas
detained
him
.
<EOS>
"Am
<EOS>
I
a
prisoner
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
uneasily
,
and
glancing
at
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
promised
me
instant
liberation
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
the
promise
shall
be
fulfilled
as
soon
as
I
am
satisfied
my
daughter
is
out
of
danger
,
"
returned
Sir
Thomas
.
<EOS>
"I
am
easy
,
then
,
"
said
the
apothecary
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
answer
for
her
speedy
recovery

"CHAPTER
<EOS>
V.A
Visit
to
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
's
Habitation
Near
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
Allowing
an
interval
of
three
or
four
months
to
elapse
between
the
events
last
recorded
,
and
those
about
to
be
narrated
,
we
shall
now
conduct
the
reader
to
a
large
,
gloomy
habitation
near
Fleet
Bridge
.
<EOS>
At
first
view
,
this
structure
,
with
its
stone
walls
,
corner
turrets
,
ponderous
door
,
and
barred
windows
,
might
be
taken
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
ancient
prison
existing
in
this
locality
.
<EOS>
Such
,
however
,
was
not
the
fact
.
<EOS>
The
little
river
Fleet
,
whose
muddy
current
was
at
that
time
open
to
view
,
flowed
between
the
two
buildings
;
and
the
grim
and
frowning
mansion
we
propose
to
describe
stood
on
the
western
bank
,
exactly
opposite
the
gateway
of
the
prison
.
<EOS>
Now
,
as
no
one
had
a
stronger
interest
in
the
Fleet
Prison
than
the
owner
of
that
gloomy
house
,
inasmuch
as
he
had
lodged
more
persons
within
it
than
any
one
ever
did
before
him
,
it
would
almost
seem
that
he
had
selected
his
abode
for
the
purpose
of
watching
over
the
safe
custody
of
the
numerous
victims
of
his
rapacity
and
tyranny
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
general
surmise
;
and
,
it
must
be
owned
,
there
was
ample
warranty
for
it
in
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
A
loop
-
hole
in
the
turret
at
the
north
-
east
angle
of
the
house
commanded
the
courts
of
the
prison
,
and
here
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
would
frequently
station
himself
to
note
what
was
going
forward
within
the
jail
,
and
examine
the
looks
and
deportment
of
those
kept
by
him
in
durance
.
<EOS>
Many
a
glance
of
hatred
and
defiance
was
thrown
from
these
sombre
courts
at
the
narrow
aperture
at
which
he
was
known
to
place
himself
;
but
such
regards
only
excited
Sir
Giles
's
derision
:
<EOS>
many
an
imploring
gesture
was
made
to
him
;
but
these
entreaties
for
compassion
were
equally
disregarded
.
<EOS>
Being
a
particular
friend
of
the
Warden
of
the
Fleet
,
and
the
jailers
obeying
him
as
they
would
have
done
their
principal
,
he
entered
the
prison
when
he
pleased
,
and
visited
any
ward
he
chose
,
at
any
hour
of
day
or
night
;
and
though
the
unfortunate
prisoners
complained
of
the
annoyance,—and
especially
those
to
whom
his
presence
was
obnoxious,—no
redress
could
be
obtained
.
<EOS>
He
always
appeared
when
least
expected
,
and
seemed
to
take
a
malicious
pleasure
in
troubling
those
most
anxious
to
avoid
him
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
Sir
Giles
the
only
visitant
to
the
prison
.
<EOS>
Clement
Lanyere
was
as
frequently
to
be
seen
within
its
courts
and
wards
as
his
master
,
and
a
similar
understanding
appeared
to
exist
between
him
and
the
jailers
.
<EOS>
Hence
,
he
was
nearly
as
much
an
object
of
dread
and
dislike
as
Sir
Giles
himself
,
and
few
saw
the
masked
and
shrouded
figure
of
the
spy
approach
them
without
misgiving
.
<EOS>
From
the
strange
and
unwarrantable
influence
exercised
by
Sir
Giles
and
the
promoter
in
the
prison
,
they
came
at
length
to
be
considered
as
part
of
it
;
and
matters
were
as
frequently
referred
to
them
by
the
subordinate
officers
as
to
the
warden
.
<EOS>
It
was
even
supposed
by
some
of
the
prisoners
that
a
secret
means
of
communication
must
exist
between
Sir
Giles
's
habitation
and
the
jail
;
but
as
both
he
and
Lanyere
possessed
keys
of
the
wicket
,
such
a
contrivance
was
obviously
unnecessary
,
and
would
have
been
dangerous
,
as
it
must
have
been
found
out
at
some
time
by
those
interested
in
the
discovery
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
shown
,
however
,
that
,
in
one
way
or
other
,
Sir
Giles
had
nearly
as
much
to
do
with
the
management
of
the
Fleet
Prison
as
those
to
whom
its
governance
was
ostensibly
committed
,
and
that
he
could
,
if
he
thought
proper
,
aggravate
the
sufferings
of
its
unfortunate
occupants
without
incurring
any
responsibility
for
his
treatment
of
them
.
<EOS>
He
looked
upon
the
Star
-
Chamber
and
the
Fleet
as
the
means
by
which
he
could
plunder
society
and
stifle
the
cry
of
the
oppressed
;
and
it
was
his
business
to
see
that
both
machines
were
kept
in
good
order
,
and
worked
well
.
<EOS>
But
to
return
to
his
habitation
.
<EOS>
Its
internal
appearance
corresponded
with
its
forbidding
exterior
.
<EOS>
The
apartments
were
large
,
but
cold
and
comfortless
,
and
,
with
two
or
three
exceptions
,
scantily
furnished
.
<EOS>
Sumptuously
decorated
,
these
exceptional
rooms
presented
a
striking
contrast
to
the
rest
of
the
house
;
but
they
were
never
opened
,
except
on
the
occasion
of
some
grand
entertainment
—
a
circumstance
of
rare
occurrence
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
large
hall
of
entrance
,
where
Sir
Giles
's
myrmidons
were
wo
nt
to
assemble
,
with
a
great
table
in
the
midst
of
it
,
on
which
no
victuals
were
ever
placed
—
at
least
at
the
extortioner
's
expense
—
and
a
great
fire
-
place
,
where
no
fire
ever
burnt
.
<EOS>
From
this
a
broad
stone
staircase
mounted
to
the
upper
part
of
the
house
,
and
communicated
by
means
of
dusky
corridors
and
narrow
passages
with
the
various
apartments
.
<EOS>
A
turnpike
staircase
connected
the
turret
to
which
Sir
Giles
used
to
resort
to
reconnoitre
the
Fleet
Prison
,
with
the
lower
part
of
the
habitation
,
and
similar
corkscrew
stairs
existed
in
the
other
angles
of
the
structure
.
<EOS>
When
stationed
at
the
loophole
,
little
recked
Sir
Giles
of
the
mighty
cathedral
that
frowned
upon
him
like
the
offended
eye
of
heaven
.
<EOS>
His
gaze
was
seldom
raised
towards
Saint
Paul
's
,
or
if
it
were
,
he
had
no
perception
of
the
beauty
or
majesty
of
the
ancient
cathedral
.
<EOS>
The
object
of
interest
was
immediately
below
him
.
<EOS>
The
sternest
realities
of
life
were
what
he
dealt
with
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
taste
for
the
sublime
or
the
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
had
just
paid
an
inquisitorial
visit
,
such
as
we
have
described
,
to
the
prison
,
and
was
returning
homewards
over
Fleet
Bridge
,
when
he
encountered
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
,
who
was
coming
in
quest
of
him
,
and
they
proceeded
to
his
habitation
together
.
<EOS>
Nothing
beyond
a
slight
greeting
passed
between
them
in
the
street
,
for
Sir
Giles
was
ever
jealous
of
his
slightest
word
being
overheard
;
but
he
could
see
from
his
partner
's
manner
that
something
had
occurred
to
annoy
and
irritate
him
greatly
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
was
in
no
respect
changed
since
the
reader
last
beheld
him
.
<EOS>
Habited
in
the
same
suit
of
sables
,
he
still
wore
the
same
mantle
,
and
the
same
plumed
hat
,
and
had
the
same
long
rapier
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
His
deportment
,
too
,
was
as
commanding
as
before
,
and
his
aspect
as
stern
and
menacing
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
,
however
,
had
not
escaped
the
consequences
naturally
to
be
expected
from
the
punishment
inflicted
upon
him
by
the
apprentices
,
being
so
rheumatic
that
he
could
scarcely
walk
,
while
a
violent
cough
,
with
which
he
was
occasionally
seized
,
and
which
took
its
date
from
the
disastrous
day
referred
to
,
and
had
never
left
him
since
,
threatened
to
shake
his
feeble
frame
in
pieces
;
this
,
added
to
the
exasperation
under
which
he
was
evidently
labouring
,
was
almost
too
much
for
him
.
<EOS>
Three
months
seemed
to
have
placed
as
many
years
upon
his
head
;
or
,
at
all
events
,
to
have
taken
a
vast
deal
out
of
his
constitution
.
<EOS>
But
,
notwithstanding
his
increased
infirmities
,
and
utter
unfitness
for
the
part
he
attempted
to
play
,
he
still
affected
a
youthful
air
,
and
still
aped
all
the
extravagances
and
absurdities
in
dress
and
manner
of
the
gayest
and
youngest
court
coxcomb
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
attired
in
silks
and
satins
of
the
gaudiest
hues
,
still
carefully
trimmed
as
to
hair
and
beard
,
still
redolent
of
perfumes
.
<EOS>
Not
without
exhibiting
considerable
impatience
,
Sir
Giles
was
obliged
to
regulate
his
pace
by
the
slow
and
tottering
steps
of
his
companion
,
and
was
more
than
once
brought
to
a
halt
as
the
lungs
of
the
latter
were
convulsively
torn
by
his
cough
,
but
at
last
they
reached
the
house
,
and
entered
the
great
hall
,
where
the
myrmidons
were
assembled
—
all
of
whom
rose
on
their
appearance
,
and
saluted
them
.
<EOS>
There
was
Captain
Bludder
,
with
his
braggart
air
,
attended
by
some
half
-
dozen
Alsatian
bullies
;
Lupo
Vulp
,
with
his
crafty
looks
;
and
the
tipstaves
—
all
,
in
short
,
were
present
,
excepting
Clement
Lanyere
,
and
Sir
Giles
knew
how
to
account
for
his
absence
.
<EOS>
To
the
inquiries
of
Captain
Bludder
and
his
associates
,
whether
they
were
likely
to
be
required
on
any
business
that
day
,
Sir
Giles
gave
a
doubtful
answer
,
and
placing
some
pieces
of
money
in
the
Alsatian
's
hand
,
bade
him
repair
,
with
his
followers
,
to
the
"
Rose
Tavern
,
"
in
Hanging
Sword
Court
,
and
crush
a
flask
or
two
of
wine
,
and
then
return
for
orders
—
an
injunction
with
which
the
captain
willingly
complied
.
<EOS>
To
the
tipstaves
Sir
Giles
made
no
observation
,
and
bidding
Lupo
Vulp
hold
himself
in
readiness
for
a
summons
,
he
passed
on
with
his
partner
to
an
inner
apartment
.
<EOS>
On
Sir
Francis
gaining
it
,
he
sank
into
a
chair
,
and
was
again
seized
with
a
fit
of
coughing
that
threatened
him
with
annihilation
.
<EOS>
When
it
ceased
,
he
made
an
effort
to
commence
the
conversation
,
and
Sir
Giles
,
who
had
been
pacing
to
and
fro
impatiently
within
the
chamber
,
stopped
to
listen
to
him
.
<EOS>
"You
will
wonder
what
business
has
brought
me
hither
to
-
day
,
Sir
Giles
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
I
will
keep
you
no
longer
in
suspense
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
insulted
,
Sir
Giles
—
grievously
insulted
.
<EOS>
""By
<EOS>
whom
?
"
demanded
the
extortioner
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
,
"
replied
Sir
Francis
,
shaking
with
passion
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
received
a
degrading
insult
from
him
to
-
day
,
which
ought
to
be
washed
out
with
his
blood
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
hath
he
done
to
you
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
other
.
<EOS>
"I
will
tell
you
,
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
I
chanced
to
see
him
in
the
court
-
yard
of
the
palace
of
Whitehall
,
and
there
being
several
gallants
nigh
at
hand
,
who
I
thought
would
take
my
part
—
ough
!
<EOS>
ough
!
<EOS>
what
a
plaguey
cough
I
have
gotten
,
to
be
sure
;
but
'
t
is
all
owing
to
those
cursed
'
prentices
—
a
murrain
seize
'em
!
<EOS>
Your
patience
,
sweet
Sir
Giles
,
I
am
coming
to
the
point
—
ough
!
<EOS>
ough
!
<EOS>
there
it
takes
me
again
.
<EOS>
Well
,
as
I
was
saying
,
thinking
the
gallants
with
whom
I
was
conversing
would
back
me
,
and
perceiving
Mounchensey
approach
us
,
I
thought
I
might
venture"—"Venture
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Sir
Giles
,
scornfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
not
such
a
disgraceful
word
pass
your
lips
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
mean
,
I
thought
I
might
take
occasion
to
affront
him
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
I
cocked
my
hat
fiercely
,
as
I
have
seen
you
and
Captain
Bludder
do
,
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
""Couple
<EOS>
me
not
with
the
Alsatian
,
I
pray
of
you
,
Sir
Francis
,
"
observed
the
extortioner
,
sharply
.
<EOS>
"Your
pardon
,
Sir
Giles
—
your
pardon
!
<EOS>
But
as
I
was
saying
,
I
regarded
him
with
a
scowl
,
and
tapped
the
hilt
of
my
sword
.
<EOS>
And
what
think
you
the
ruffianly
fellow
did
?
<EOS>
I
almost
blush
at
the
bare
relation
of
it
.
<EOS>
Firstly
,
he
plucked
off
my
hat
,
telling
me
I
ought
to
stand
bareheaded
in
the
presence
of
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
Next
,
he
tweaked
my
nose
,
and
as
I
turned
round
to
avoid
him
,
he
applied
his
foot
—
yes
,
his
foot
—
to
the
back
of
my
trunk
-
hose
;
and
well
was
it
that
the
hose
were
stoutly
wadded
and
quilted
.
<EOS>
Fire
and
fury
!
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
,
I
can
not
brook
the
indignity
.
<EOS>
And
what
was
worse
,
the
shameless
gallants
,
who
ought
to
have
lent
me
aid
,
were
ready
to
split
their
sides
with
laughter
,
and
declared
I
had
only
gotten
my
due
.
<EOS>
When
I
could
find
utterance
for
very
choler
,
I
told
the
villain
you
would
requite
him
,
and
he
answered
he
would
serve
you
in
the
same
fashion
,
whenever
you
crossed
his
path
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
said
he
so
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Sir
Giles
,
half
drawing
his
sword
,
while
his
eyes
flashed
fire
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
whether
he
will
make
good
his
words
.
<EOS>
Yet
no
!
<EOS>
Revenge
must
not
be
accomplished
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
told
you
I
am
willing
to
let
him
pursue
his
present
career
undisturbed
for
a
time
,
in
order
to
make
his
fall
the
greater
.
<EOS>
I
hold
him
in
my
hand
,
and
can
crush
him
when
I
please
.
<EOS>
""Then
do
not
defer
your
purpose
,
Sir
Giles
,
"
said
Sir
Francis
;
"
or
I
must
take
my
own
means
of
setting
myself
right
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
consent
to
sit
down
calmly
under
the
provocation
I
have
endured
.
<EOS>
""And
what
will
be
the
momentary
gratification
afforded
by
his
death
—
if
such
you
meditate
,
"
returned
Sir
Giles
,
"
in
comparison
with
hurling
him
down
from
the
point
he
has
gained
,
stripping
him
of
all
his
honours
,
and
of
such
wealth
as
he
may
have
acquired
,
and
plunging
him
into
the
Fleet
Prison
,
where
he
will
die
by
inches
,
and
where
you
yourself
may
feast
your
eyes
on
his
slow
agonies
?
<EOS>
That
is
true
revenge
;
and
you
are
but
a
novice
in
the
art
of
vengeance
if
you
think
your
plan
equal
to
mine
.
<EOS>
It
is
for
this
—
and
this
only
—
that
I
have
spared
him
so
long
.
<EOS>
I
have
suffered
him
to
puff
himself
up
with
pride
and
insolence
,
till
he
is
ready
to
burst
.
<EOS>
But
his
day
of
reckoning
is
at
hand
,
and
then
he
shall
pay
off
the
long
arrears
he
owes
us
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
Sir
Giles
,
I
am
willing
to
leave
the
matter
with
you
,
"
said
Sir
Francis
;
"
but
it
is
hard
to
be
publicly
insulted
,
and
have
injurious
epithets
applied
to
you
,
and
not
obtain
immediate
redress
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
grant
you
<EOS>
it
is
so
,
"
rejoined
Sir
Giles
;
"
but
you
well
know
you
are
no
match
for
him
at
the
sword
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
I
am
not
,
others
are
—
Clement
Lanyere
,
for
instance
,
"
cried
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
more
than
once
arranged
a
quarrel
for
me
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
were
it
an
ordinary
case
<EOS>
,
I
would
advise
that
the
arrangement
of
this
quarrel
should
be
left
to
Lanyere
,
"
said
Sir
Giles
;
"
or
I
myself
would
undertake
it
for
you
.
<EOS>
But
that
were
only
half
revenge
.
<EOS>
No
;
the
work
must
be
done
completely
;
and
the
triumph
you
will
gain
in
the
end
will
amply
compensate
you
for
the
delay
.
<EOS>
""Be
it
<EOS>
so
,
then
,
"
replied
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
"
But
before
I
quit
the
subject
,
I
may
remark
,
that
one
thing
perplexes
me
in
the
sudden
rise
of
this
upstart
,
and
that
is
that
he
encounters
no
opposition
from
Buckingham
.
<EOS>
Even
the
King
,
I
am
told
,
has
expressed
his
surprise
that
the
jealous
Marquis
should
view
one
who
may
turn
out
a
rival
with
so
much
apparent
complacency
.
<EOS>
""It
is
because
Buckingham
has
no
fear
of
him
,
"
replied
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
knows
he
has
but
to
say
the
word
,
and
the
puppet
brought
forward
by
De
Gondomar
—
for
it
is
by
him
that
Mounchensey
is
supported
—
will
be
instantly
removed
;
but
as
he
also
knows
,
that
another
would
be
set
up
,
he
is
content
to
let
him
occupy
the
place
for
a
time
.
<EOS>
""Certes
,
if
Mounchensey
had
more
knowledge
of
the
world
he
would
distrust
him
,
"
said
Sir
Francis
,
"
because
in
my
opinion
Buckingham
overacts
his
part
,
and
shows
him
too
much
attention
.
<EOS>
He
invites
him
,
as
I
am
given
to
understand
,
to
all
his
masques
,
banquets
,
and
revels
at
York
House
,
and
even
condescends
to
flatter
him
.
<EOS>
Such
conduct
would
awaken
suspicion
in
any
one
save
the
object
of
it
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
have
told
you
Buckingham
's
motive
,
and
therefore
his
conduct
will
no
longer
surprise
you
.
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
of
the
wager
between
De
Gondomar
and
the
Marquis
,
in
consequence
of
which
a
trial
of
skill
is
to
be
made
in
the
Tilt
-
yard
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
Mounchensey
is
to
run
against
Buckingham
,
and
I
leave
you
to
guess
what
the
result
will
be
.
<EOS>
I
myself
am
to
be
among
the
jousters
.
<EOS>
""You
!
"
exclaimed
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
"Even
<EOS>
I
,
"
replied
Sir
Giles
,
with
a
smile
of
gratified
vanity
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
mark
me
,
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
surprise
for
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
enough
for
me
to
hurl
this
aspiring
youth
from
his
proud
position
,
and
cover
him
with
disgrace
—
it
is
not
enough
to
immure
him
in
the
Fleet
;
but
I
will
deprive
him
of
his
choicest
treasure
—
of
the
object
of
his
devoted
affections
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
my
directions
Clement
Lanyere
has
kept
constant
watch
over
him
,
and
has
discovered
that
the
young
man
's
heart
is
fixed
upon
a
maiden
of
great
beauty
,
named
Aveline
Calveley
,
daughter
of
the
crazy
Puritan
who
threatened
the
King
's
life
some
three
or
four
months
ago
at
Theobalds
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
mind
me
of
the
circumstance
,
"
observed
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
"This
<EOS>
maiden
lives
in
great
seclusion
with
an
elderly
dame
,
but
I
have
found
out
her
retreat
.
<EOS>
I
have
said
that
Sir
Jocelyn
is
enamoured
of
her
,
and
she
is
by
no
means
insensible
to
his
passion
.
<EOS>
But
a
bar
exists
to
their
happiness
.
<EOS>
Almost
with
his
last
breath
,
a
promise
was
extorted
from
his
daughter
by
Hugh
Calveley
,
that
if
her
hand
should
be
claimed
within
a
year
by
one
to
whom
he
had
engaged
her
,
but
with
whose
name
even
she
was
wholly
unacquainted
,
she
would
unhesitatingly
give
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
will
the
claim
be
made?""It
will
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
think
you
<EOS>
she
will
fulfil
her
promise?""I
am
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
A
dying
father
's
commands
are
sacred
with
one
like
her
.
<EOS>
""Have
<EOS>
you
seen
her
,
Sir
Giles
?
<EOS>
Is
she
so
very
beautiful
as
represented?""I
have
not
yet
seen
her
;
but
she
will
be
here
anon
.
<EOS>
And
you
can
then
judge
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
""She
here
!
"
exclaimed
Sir
Francis
.
"
<EOS>
By
what
magic
will
you
bring
her
hither?""By
<EOS>
a
spell
that
can
not
fail
in
effect
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Sir
Giles
,
with
a
grim
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
summoned
her
in
her
father
's
name
.
<EOS>
I
have
sent
for
her
to
tell
her
that
her
hand
will
be
claimed
.
<EOS>
""By
<EOS>
whom
?
"
inquired
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
"That
is
my
secret
,
"
replied
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
,
and
Sir
Giles
,
telling
the
person
without
to
enter
,
it
was
opened
by
Clement
Lanyere
,
wrapped
in
his
long
mantle
,
and
with
his
countenance
hidden
by
his
mask
.
<EOS>
"They
are
here
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"The
damsel
and
the
elderly
female
?
"
cried
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
And
receiving
a
response
in
the
affirmative
from
the
promoter
,
he
bade
him
usher
them
in
at
once
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
Aveline
,
attended
by
a
decent
-
looking
woman
,
somewhat
stricken
in
years
,
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
They
were
followed
by
Clement
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
The
maiden
was
attired
in
deep
mourning
,
and
though
looking
very
pale
,
her
surpassing
beauty
produced
a
strong
impression
upon
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
,
who
instantly
arose
on
seeing
her
,
and
made
her
a
profound
,
and
,
as
he
considered
,
courtly
salutation
.
<EOS>
Without
bestowing
any
attention
on
him
,
Aveline
addressed
herself
to
Sir
Giles
,
whose
look
filled
her
with
terror
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
have
you
sent
for
me
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
she
demanded
.
<EOS>
"I
have
sent
for
you
,
Aveline
Calveley
,
to
remind
you
of
the
promise
made
by
you
to
your
dying
father
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
;
"
then
my
forebodings
of
ill
are
realized
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
know
you
consider
that
promise
binding
,
"
pursued
Sir
Giles
;
"
and
it
is
only
necessary
for
me
to
announce
to
you
that
,
in
a
week
from
this
time
,
your
hand
will
be
claimed
in
marriage
.
<EOS>
""Alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
in
accents
of
despair
.
<EOS>
"
But
who
will
claim
it?—and
how
can
the
claim
be
substantiated
?
"
<EOS>
she
added
,
recovering
herself
in
some
degree
.
<EOS>
"You
will
learn
at
the
time
I
have
appointed
,
"
replied
Sir
Giles
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
having
given
you
notice
to
prepare
for
the
fulfilment
of
an
engagement
solemnly
contracted
by
your
father
,
and
as
solemnly
agreed
to
by
yourself
,
I
will
no
longer
detain
you
.
<EOS>
"Aveline
<EOS>
gazed
at
him
with
wonder
and
terror
,
and
would
have
sought
for
some
further
explanation
;
but
perceiving
from
the
inflexible
expression
of
his
countenance
that
any
appeal
would
be
useless
,
she
quitted
the
room
with
her
companion
.
<EOS>
"I
would
give
half
I
possess
to
make
that
maiden
mine
,
"
cried
Sir
Francis
,
intoxicated
with
admiration
of
her
beauty
.
<EOS>
"Humph
!
"
exclaimed
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"
More
difficult
matters
have
been
accomplished
.
<EOS>
Half
your
possessions
,
say
you
?
<EOS>
She
is
not
worth
so
much
.
<EOS>
Assign
to
me
<EOS>
your
share
of
the
Mounchensey
estates

she
shall
be
yours

""I
will
do
it

Sir
Giles
—
I
will
do
it
,
"
cried
the
old
usurer
,
eagerly
;
"
but
you
must
prove
to
me
first
that
you
can
make
good
your
words

""Pshaw
!
<EOS>
Have
I
ever
deceived
you
,
man

<EOS>
But
rest
easy
.
<EOS>
You
shall
be
fully
satisfied

<EOS>
""Then
call
in
Lupo
Vulp
,

let
him
prepare
the

cried
Sir
Francis

"
I
shall
have
a
rare
prize

shall
effectually
revenge
myself

this
detested

"CHAPTER
<EOS>
VI.Of
<EOS>
the
Wager
between
the
Conde
de
Gondomarand
the
Marquis
of
Buckingham
.
<EOS>
At
a
banquet
given
at
Whitehall
,
attended
by
all
the
principal
lords
and
ladies
of
the
court
,
a
wager
was
laid
between
the
Conde
de
Gondomar
and
the
Marquis
of
Buckingham
,
the
decision
of
which
was
referred
to
the
King
.
<EOS>
The
circumstance
occurred
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
The
discourse
happened
to
turn
upon
jousting
,
and
the
magnificent
favourite
,
who
was
held
unrivalled
in
all
martial
exercises
and
chivalrous
sports
,
and
who
,
confident
in
his
own
skill
,
vauntingly
declared
that
he
had
never
met
his
match
in
the
tilt
-
yard
;
whereupon
the
Spanish
Ambassador
,
willing
to
lower
his
pride
,
immediately
rejoined
,
that
he
could
,
upon
the
instant
,
produce
a
better
man
-
at
-
arms
than
he
;
and
so
certain
was
he
of
being
able
to
make
good
his
words
,
that
he
was
willing
to
stake
a
thousand
doubloons
to
a
hundred
on
the
issue
of
a
trial
.
<EOS>
To
this
Buckingham
haughtily
replied
,
that
he
at
once
accepted
the
Ambassador
's
challenge
;
but
in
regard
to
the
terms
of
the
wager
,
they
must
be
somewhat
modified
,
as
he
could
not
accept
them
as
proposed
;
but
he
was
willing
to
hazard
on
the
result
of
the
encounter
all
the
gems
,
with
which
at
the
moment
his
habiliments
were
covered
,
against
the
single
diamond
clasp
worn
by
De
Gondomar
;
and
if
the
offer
suited
his
Excellency
,
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
appoint
the
day
,
and
bring
forward
the
man
.
<EOS>
De
Gondomar
replied
,
that
nothing
could
please
him
better
than
the
Marquis
's
modification
of
the
wager
,
and
the
proposal
was
quite
consistent
with
the
acknowledged
magnificence
of
his
Lordship
's
notions
;
yet
he
begged
to
make
one
further
alteration
,
which
was
,
that
in
the
event
of
the
knight
he
should
nominate
being
adjudged
by
his
Majesty
to
be
the
best
jouster
,
the
rich
prize
might
be
delivered
to
him
.
<EOS>
Buckingham
assented
,
and
the
terms
of
the
wager
being
now
fully
settled
,
it
only
remained
to
fix
the
day
for
the
trial
,
and
this
was
referred
to
the
King
,
who
appointed
the
following
Thursday
—
thus
allowing
,
as
the
banquet
took
place
on
a
Friday
,
nearly
a
week
for
preparation
.
<EOS>
James
,
also
,
good
-
naturedly
complied
with
the
Ambassador
's
request
,
and
agreed
to
act
as
judge
on
the
occasion
;
and
he
laughingly
remarked
to
Buckingham—"Ye
are
demented
,
Steenie
,
to
risk
a
'
those
precious
stanes
with
which
ye
are
bedecked
on
the
skill
with
which
ye
can
yield
a
frail
lance
.
<EOS>
We
may
say
unto
you
now
in
the
words
of
the
poet—'Pendebant
ter
ti
gemmata
monilia
collo;'but
<EOS>
wha
shall
say
frae
whose
round
throat
those
gemmed
collars
and
glittering
ouches
will
hang
a
week
<EOS>
hence
,
if
ye
be
worsted
?
<EOS>
Think
of
that
,
my
dear
dog
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
Majesty
need
be
under
no
apprehension
,
"
replied
Buckingham
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
win
and
wear
his
Excellency
's
diamond
clasp
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
perhaps
,
the
Count
will
make
us
acquainted
with
the
name
and
title
of
my
puissant
adversary
,
on
whose
address
he
so
much
relies
.
<EOS>
Our
relative
chances
of
success
will
then
be
more
apparent
.
<EOS>
If
,
however
,
any
motives
for
secrecy
exist
,
I
will
not
press
the
inquiry
,
but
leave
the
disclosure
to
a
more
convenient
season
.
<EOS>
""Nunc
est
narrandi
tempus
,
"
rejoined
the
King
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
time
like
the
present
.
<EOS>
We
are
anxious
to
ken
wha
<EOS>
the
hero
may
be
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
keep
your
Majesty
a
moment
in
suspense
,
"
said
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
young
knight
whom
I
design
to
select
as
the
Marquis
's
opponent
,
and
whom
I
am
sure
will
feel
grateful
for
having
such
means
of
honourable
distinction
afforded
him
,
is
present
at
the
banquet
.
<EOS>
""Here
!
"
exclaimed
James
,
looking
round
.
"
<EOS>
To
whom
do
you
refer
,
Count
?
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
Sir
Gilbert
Gerrard
,
or
Sir
Henry
Rich
;
for
—
without
saying
aught
in
disparagement
of
their
prowess
—
neither
of
them
is
a
match
for
Buckingham
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
save
us
!
<EOS>
We
hae
it
.
<EOS>
Ye
mean
Sir
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
as
the
Ambassador
acknowledged
that
his
Majesty
was
right
,
all
eyes
were
turned
towards
the
young
knight
,
who
,
though
as
much
surprised
as
any
one
else
,
could
not
help
feeling
greatly
elated
.
<EOS>
"Aweel
,
Count
<EOS>
,
"
said
James
,
evidently
pleased
,
"
ye
might
hae
made
a
waur
choice
—
that
we
are
free
to
confess
.
<EOS>
We
begin
to
tremble
for
your
braw
jewels
,
Steenie
.
<EOS>
""They
are
safer
than
I
expected
,
"
replied
Buckingham
,
disdainfully
.
<EOS>
But
though
he
thus
laughed
it
off
,
it
was
evident
he
was
displeased
,
and
he
muttered
to
his
confidential
friend
,
Lord
Mordaunt,—"I
see
through
it
all
:
this
is
a
concerted
scheme
to
bring
this
aspiring
galliard
forward
;
but
he
shall
receive
a
lesson
for
his
presumption
he
shall
not
easily
forget
,
while
,
at
the
same
time
,
those
who
make
use
of
him
for
their
own
purposes
shall
be
taught
the
risk
they
incur
in
daring
to
oppose
me
.
<EOS>
The
present
opportunity
shall
not
be
neglected
.
<EOS>
"Having
<EOS>
formed
this
resolution
,
Buckingham
,
to
all
appearance
,
entirely
recovered
his
gaiety
,
and
pressed
the
King
to
give
importance
to
the
trial
by
allowing
it
to
take
place
in
the
royal
tilt
-
yard
at
Whitehall
,
and
to
extend
the
number
of
jousters
to
fourteen
—
seven
on
one
side
,
and
seven
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
The
request
was
readily
granted
by
the
monarch
,
who
appeared
to
take
a
stronger
interest
in
the
match
than
Buckingham
altogether
liked
,
and
confirmed
him
in
his
determination
of
ridding
himself
for
ever
of
the
obstacle
in
his
path
presented
by
Mounchensey
.
<EOS>
The
number
of
jousters
being
agreed
upon
,
it
was
next
decided
that
the
party
with
whom
Buckingham
was
to
range
should
be
headed
by
the
Duke
of
Lennox
;
while
Mounchensey
's
party
was
to
be
under
the
command
of
Prince
Charles
;
and
though
the
disposition
was
too
flattering
to
his
adversary
to
be
altogether
agreeable
to
the
haughty
favourite
,
he
could
not
raise
any
reasonable
objection
to
it
,
and
was
therefore
obliged
to
submit
with
the
best
grace
he
could
.
<EOS>
The
two
parties
were
then
distributed
in
the
following
order
by
the
King:—On
<EOS>
the
side
of
the
Duke
of
Lennox
,
besides
Buckingham
himself
,
were
the
Earls
of
Arundel
and
Pembroke
,
and
the
Lords
Clifford
and
Mordaunt
;
and
while
the
King
was
hesitating
as
to
the
seventh
,
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
was
suggested
by
the
Marquis
,
and
James
,
willing
to
oblige
his
favourite
,
adopted
the
proposition
.
<EOS>
On
the
side
of
Prince
Charles
were
ranked
the
Marquis
of
Hamilton
,
the
Earls
of
Montgomery
,
Rutland
,
and
Dorset
,
Lord
Walden
,
and
,
of
course
,
Sir
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
.
<EOS>
These
preliminaries
being
fully
adjusted
,
other
topics
were
started
,
and
the
carouse
,
which
had
been
in
some
degree
interrupted
,
was
renewed
,
and
continued
,
with
the
entertainments
that
succeeded
it
,
till
past
midnight
.
<EOS>
Not
a
little
elated
by
the
high
compliment
paid
to
his
prowess
by
the
Spanish
Ambassador
,
and
burning
to
break
a
lance
with
Buckingham
,
Sir
Jocelyn
resolved
to
distinguish
himself
at
the
trial
.
<EOS>
Good
luck
,
of
late
,
had
invariably
attended
him
.
<EOS>
Within
the
last
few
weeks
,
he
had
been
appointed
one
of
the
Gentlemen
of
his
Majesty
's
Bed
-
chamber
;
and
this
was
looked
upon
as
the
stepping
-
stone
to
some
more
exalted
post
.
<EOS>
Supported
by
the
influence
of
De
Gondomar
,
and
upheld
by
his
own
personal
merits
,
which
by
this
time
,
in
spite
of
all
hostility
towards
him
,
had
begun
to
be
appreciated
;
with
the
King
himself
most
favourably
inclined
towards
him
,
and
Prince
Charles
amicably
disposed
;
with
many
of
the
courtiers
proffering
him
service
,
who
were
anxious
to
throw
off
their
forced
allegiance
to
the
overweening
favourite
,
and
substitute
another
in
his
stead
:
with
all
these
advantages
,
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
,
that
in
a
short
space
of
time
he
should
have
established
a
firm
footing
on
that
smooth
and
treacherous
surface
,
the
pavement
of
a
palace
,
and
have
already
become
an
object
of
envy
and
jealousy
to
many
,
and
of
admiration
to
a
few
.
<EOS>
Possessing
the
faculty
of
adapting
himself
to
circumstances
,
Sir
Jocelyn
conducted
himself
with
rare
discretion
;
and
while
avoiding
giving
offence
,
never
suffered
a
liberty
to
be
taken
with
himself
;
and
having
on
the
onset
established
a
character
for
courage
,
he
was
little
afterwards
molested
.
<EOS>
It
was
creditable
to
him
,
that
in
a
court
where
morality
was
at
so
low
an
ebb
as
that
of
James
I.
,
he
should
have
remained
uncorrupted
;
and
that
not
all
the
allurements
of
the
numerous
beauties
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
,
and
who
exerted
their
blandishments
to
ensnare
him
,
could
tempt
him
for
a
moment
's
disloyalty
to
the
object
of
his
affections
.
<EOS>
It
was
creditable
,
that
at
the
frequent
orgies
he
was
compelled
to
attend
,
where
sobriety
was
derided
,
and
revelry
pushed
to
its
furthest
limits
,
he
was
never
on
any
occasion
carried
beyond
the
bounds
of
discretion
.
<EOS>
It
was
still
more
creditable
to
him
,
that
in
such
venal
and
corrupt
days
he
maintained
his
integrity
perfectly
unsullied
.
<EOS>
Thus
severely
tested
,
the
true
worth
of
his
character
was
proved
,
and
he
came
from
the
ordeal
without
a
blemish
.
<EOS>
The
many
excellent
qualities
that
distinguished
the
newly
-
made
knight
and
gentleman
of
the
bed
-
chamber
,
combined
with
his
remarkable
personal
advantages
and
conciliatory
manner
,
considerably
improved
by
the
polish
he
had
recently
acquired
,
drew
,
as
we
have
intimated
,
the
attention
of
the
second
personage
in
the
kingdom
towards
him
.
<EOS>
Struck
by
his
manner
,
and
by
the
sentiments
he
expressed
,
Prince
Charles
took
frequent
opportunities
of
conversing
with
him
,
and
might
have
conceived
a
regard
for
him
but
for
the
jealous
interference
of
Buckingham
,
who
,
unable
to
brook
a
rival
either
with
the
King
or
Prince
,
secretly
endeavoured
to
set
both
against
him
.
<EOS>
Such
,
however
,
was
Sir
Jocelyn
's
consistency
of
character
,
such
his
solidity
of
judgment
and
firmness
,
and
such
the
respect
he
inspired
,
that
he
seemed
likely
to
triumph
over
all
the
insidious
snares
planned
for
him
.
<EOS>
Things
were
in
this
state
when
the
trial
of
skill
in
jousting
was
proposed
by
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
The
wily
Ambassador
might
have
—
and
probably
had
—
some
secret
motive
in
making
the
proposal
;
but
whatever
it
was
,
it
was
unknown
to
his
protégé
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VII.A
Cloud
in
the
Horizon
.
<EOS>
But
it
must
not
be
imagined
that
Sir
Jocelyn
's
whole
time
was
passed
in
attendance
on
the
court
.
<EOS>
Not
a
day
flew
by
that
he
did
not
pay
a
visit
to
Aveline
.
<EOS>
She
had
taken
a
little
cottage
,
where
she
dwelt
in
perfect
seclusion
,
with
one
female
attendant
,
old
Dame
Sherborne,—the
same
who
had
accompanied
her
on
her
compulsory
visit
to
Sir
Giles
Mompesson,—and
her
father
's
faithful
old
servant
,
Anthony
Rocke
.
<EOS>
To
this
retreat
,
situated
in
the
then
rural
neighbourhood
adjoining
Holborn
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
as
we
have
said
,
daily
repaired
,
and
the
moments
so
spent
were
the
most
delicious
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
The
feelings
of
regard
entertained
for
him
from
the
first
by
Aveline
,
had
by
this
time
ripened
into
love
;
yet
,
mindful
of
her
solemn
promise
to
her
father
,
she
checked
her
growing
affection
as
much
as
lay
in
her
power
,
and
would
not
,
at
first
,
permit
any
words
of
tenderness
to
be
uttered
by
him
.
<EOS>
As
weeks
,
however
,
and
even
months
,
ran
on
,
and
no
one
appeared
to
claim
her
hand
,
she
began
to
indulge
the
hope
that
the
year
of
probation
would
expire
without
molestation
,
and
insensibly
,
and
almost
before
she
was
aware
of
it
,
Sir
Jocelyn
had
become
complete
master
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
In
these
interviews
,
he
told
her
all
that
occurred
to
him
at
court
—
acquainted
her
of
his
hopes
of
aggrandisement
—
and
induced
her
to
listen
to
his
expectations
of
a
brilliant
future
,
to
be
shared
by
them
together
.
<EOS>
The
severe
shock
Aveline
had
sustained
in
the
death
of
her
father
had
gradually
worn
away
,
and
,
if
not
free
from
occasional
depression
,
she
was
still
enabled
to
take
a
more
cheerful
view
of
things
.
<EOS>
Never
had
she
seen
Sir
Jocelyn
so
full
of
ardour
as
on
the
day
after
the
banquet
,
when
he
came
to
communicate
the
intelligence
of
the
jousts
,
and
that
he
was
selected
to
essay
his
skill
against
that
of
Buckingham
.
<EOS>
The
news
,
however
,
did
not
produce
upon
her
the
effect
he
expected
.
<EOS>
Not
only
she
could
not
share
his
delight
,
but
she
was
seized
with
anticipations
of
coming
ill
,
in
connection
with
this
event
,
for
which
she
could
not
account
.
<EOS>
Nor
could
all
that
Jocelyn
said
remove
her
misgivings
;
and
,
in
consequence
,
their
meeting
was
sadder
than
usual
.
<EOS>
On
the
next
day
,
these
forebodings
of
impending
calamity
were
most
unexpectedly
realised
.
<EOS>
A
mysterious
personage
,
wrapped
in
a
long
black
cloak
,
and
wearing
a
mask
,
entered
her
dwelling
without
standing
upon
the
ceremony
of
tapping
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
His
presence
occasioned
her
much
alarm
,
and
it
was
not
diminished
when
he
told
her
,
in
a
stern
,
and
peremptory
tone
,
that
she
must
accompany
him
to
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
's
habitation
.
<EOS>
Refusing
to
give
any
explanation
of
the
cause
of
this
strange
summons
,
he
said
she
would
do
well
to
comply
with
it,—that
,
indeed
,
resistance
would
be
idle
as
Sir
Giles
was
prepared
to
enforce
his
orders
;
and
that
he
himself
would
he
responsible
for
her
safety
.
<EOS>
Compelled
to
be
satisfied
with
these
assurances
,
Aveline
yielded
to
the
apparent
necessity
of
the
case
,
and
set
forth
with
him
,
attended
by
Dame
Sherbourne
.
<EOS>
With
what
passed
during
her
interview
with
the
extortioner
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
.
<EOS>
She
had
anticipated
something
dreadful
;
but
the
reality
almost
exceeded
her
anticipations
.
<EOS>
So
overpowered
was
she
by
the
painful
intelligence
,
that
it
was
with
difficulty
she
reached
home
,
and
the
rest
of
the
day
was
occupied
with
anxious
reflection
.
<EOS>
Evening
as
usual
brought
her
lover
.
<EOS>
She
met
him
at
the
door
,
where
he
tied
his
horse
,
and
they
entered
the
little
dwelling
together
.
<EOS>
The
shades
of
night
were
coming
on
apace
,
and
in
consequence
of
the
gloom
he
did
not
remark
the
traces
of
distress
on
her
countenance
,
but
went
on
with
the
theme
uppermost
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
know
you
have
ever
avoided
shows
and
triumphs
,
"
he
said
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
wish
I
could
induce
you
to
make
an
exception
in
favour
of
this
tilting
-
match
,
and
consent
to
be
present
at
it
.
<EOS>
The
thought
that
you
were
looking
on
would
nerve
my
arm
,
and
make
me
certain
of
success
.
<EOS>
""Even
<EOS>
if
I
would
,
I
can
not
comply
with
your
request
,
"
she
replied
,
in
an
agitated
tone
.
"
<EOS>
Prepare
yourself
,
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
I
have
bad
news
for
you
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
started
;
and
the
vision
of
delight
,
in
which
he
had
been
indulging
,
vanished
at
once
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
worst
news
<EOS>
you
could
have
to
tell
me
,
would
be
that
the
claim
had
been
made
,
"
he
observed
.
<EOS>
"
I
trust
it
is
not
that?""It
is
better
to
know
the
worst
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
have
received
undoubted
information
that
the
claim
will
be
made
.
<EOS>
"A
cry
of
anguish
escaped
Sir
Jocelyn
,
as
if
a
severe
blow
had
been
dealt
him
—
and
he
could
scarcely
articulate
the
inquiry
,
"
By
whom?""That
I
know
not
,
"
she
rejoined
.
"
<EOS>
But
the
ill
tidings
have
been
communicated
to
me
by
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
""Sir
<EOS>
Giles
Mompesson
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Sir
Jocelyn
,
scarcely
able
to
credit
what
he
heard
.
"
<EOS>
Your
father
would
never
have
surrendered
you
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
he
could
have
made
any
compact
with
such
a
villain
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
say
that
he
did
;
and
if
he
had
done
so
,
I
would
die
a
thousand
deaths
,
and
incur
all
the
penalties
attached
to
the
sin
of
disobedience
,
rather
than
fulfil
it
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
is
merely
the
mouth
-
piece
of
another
,
who
will
not
disclose
himself
till
he
appears
to
exact
fulfilment
of
the
fatal
pledge
.
<EOS>
""But
,
be
it
whomsoever
<EOS>
it
may
,
the
claim
never
can
be
granted
,
"
cried
Sir
Jocelyn
,
in
a
voice
of
agony
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
consent
to
be
bound
by
such
a
contract
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
thus
sacrifice
yourself
.
<EOS>
It
is
out
of
all
reason
.
<EOS>
Your
father
's
promise
can
not
bind
you
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
right
to
destroy
his
child
.
<EOS>
Will
you
listen
to
my
council
,
Aveline
?
"
<EOS>
he
continued
,
vehemently
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
received
this
warning
,
and
though
it
is
not
likely
to
have
been
given
with
any
very
friendly
design
,
still
you
may
take
advantage
of
it
,
and
avoid
by
flight
the
danger
to
which
you
are
exposed
.
<EOS>
""Impossible
<EOS>
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
reconcile
such
a
course
to
my
conscience
,
or
to
my
reverence
for
my
father
's
memory
.
<EOS>
""There
is
still
another
course
open
to
you
,
"
he
pursued
,
"
if
you
choose
to
adopt
it
;
and
that
is
,
to
take
a
stop
which
shall
make
the
fulfilment
of
this
promise
impossible
.
<EOS>
""I
understand
you
,
"
she
replied
;
"
but
that
is
equally
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
Often
and
often
have
I
thought
over
this
matter
,
and
with
much
uneasiness
;
but
I
can
not
relieve
myself
of
the
obligation
imposed
upon
me
.
<EOS>
""O
Aveline
!
"
cried
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
allow
yourself
,
by
any
fancied
scruples
,
to
be
forced
into
a
marriage
repugnant
to
your
feelings
,
you
will
condemn
both
yourself
and
me
to
misery
.
<EOS>
""I
know
it
—
<EOS>
I
feel
it
;
and
yet
there
is
no
escape
<EOS>
,
"
she
cried
,
"
Were
I
to
act
on
your
suggestions
,
and
fly
from
this
threatened
danger
,
or
remove
it
altogether
by
a
marriage
with
you
—
were
I
to
disobey
my
father
,
I
should
never
know
a
moment
's
peace
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
was
a
brief
pause
,
interrupted
only
by
her
sobs
.
<EOS>
At
length
Sir
Jocelyn
exclaimed
quickly,"Perhaps
,
we
may
be
unnecessarily
alarming
ourselves
,
and
this
may
only
be
a
trick
of
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
He
may
have
heard
of
the
promise
you
have
made
to
your
father
,
and
may
try
to
frighten
you
.
<EOS>
But
whoever
is
put
forward
must
substantiate
his
claim
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
those
words
were
uttered
,
there
was
a
slight
noise
in
the
apartment
,
and
looking
up
,
they
beheld
the
dusky
figure
of
Clement
Lanyere
,
masked
and
cloaked
,
as
was
his
wo
nt
,
standing
beside
them
.
<EOS>
"You
here
<EOS>
?
"
cried
Sir
Jocelyn
,
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
"
replied
the
promoter
;
"
I
am
come
to
tell
you
that
this
is
no
idle
<EOS>
fear,—that
the
claim
will
be
made
,
and
will
be
substantiated
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Aveline
,
in
a
tone
of
anguish
.
<EOS>
"You
will
not
seek
to
evade
it
,
I
know
,
young
mistress
,
"
replied
the
promoter
;
"
and
therefore
,
as
you
have
truly
said
,
there
is
no
escape
.
<EOS>
""Only
let
me
know
the
claimant
's
name
,
"
cried
Sir
Jocelyn
,
"
and
I
will
engage
he
shall
never
fulfill
his
design
.
<EOS>
""O
<EOS>
no
;
this
must
not
be
—
<EOS>
you
must
not
resort
to
violence
,
"
said
Aveline
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
consent
to
owe
my
deliverance
to
such
means
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
shall
have
all
the
information
you
require
after
the
jousts
on
Thursday
,
"
said
Lanyere
;
"
and
let
the
thought
strengthen
your
arm
in
the
strife
,
for
if
you
fail
,
Aveline
Calveley
will
have
no
protector
in
the
hour
of
need
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
departed
as
suddenly
and
mysteriously
as
he
had
come
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
VIII.Whitehall
.
<EOS>
The
Tilt
-
yard
at
Whitehall
,
where
the
jousting
was
appointed
to
take
place
,
was
situated
on
the
westerly
side
of
the
large
area
in
front
of
the
old
Banqueting
House
(
destroyed
by
fire
soon
after
the
date
of
this
history
,
and
replaced
by
the
stately
structure
planned
by
Inigo
Jones
,
still
existing
)
,
and
formed
part
of
a
long
range
of
buildings
appertaining
to
the
palace
,
and
running
parallel
with
it
in
a
northerly
direction
from
Westminster
,
devoted
to
purposes
of
exercise
and
recreation
,
and
including
the
Tennis
-
court
,
the
Bowling
-
alley
,
the
Manage
,
and
the
Cock
-
pit
.
<EOS>
A
succession
of
brick
walls
,
of
various
heights
,
and
surmounted
by
roofs
of
various
forms
and
sizes
,
marked
the
position
of
these
buildings
,
in
reference
to
Saint
James
's
Park
,
which
they
skirted
on
the
side
next
to
King
Street
.
<EOS>
They
were
mainly
,
if
not
entirely
erected
,
in
1532
by
Henry
VIII
.
<EOS>
,
when
,
after
his
acquisition
from
Wolsey
,
by
forfeiture
,
of
Whitehall
,
he
obtained
by
exchange
from
the
Abbot
and
Convent
of
Westminister
all
their
uninclosed
land
contiguous
to
his
newly
-
acquired
palace
,
and
immediately
fenced
it
round
,
and
converted
it
into
a
park
.
<EOS>
To
a
monarch
<EOS>
so
fond
of
robust
sports
and
manly
exercises
of
all
kinds
as
our
bluff
Harry
,
<EOS>
a
tilt
-
yard
was
indispensable
;
and
he
erected
one
on
a
grand
scale
,
and
made
it
a
place
of
constant
resort
.
<EOS>
Causing
a
space
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
in
length
and
fifty
in
width
to
be
inclosed
and
encircled
by
lofty
walls
,
he
fixed
against
the
inner
side
large
scaffolds
,
containing
two
tiers
of
seats
,
partitioned
from
each
other
like
boxes
in
a
theatre
,
for
the
accommodation
of
spectators
.
<EOS>
At
the
southern
extremity
of
the
inclosure
he
reared
a
magnificent
gallery
,
which
he
set
apart
for
his
consort
and
the
ladies
in
attendance
upon
her
.
<EOS>
This
was
decorated
with
velvet
,
and
hung
with
curtains
of
cloth
of
gold
.
<EOS>
On
grand
occasions
,
when
all
the
court
was
present
,
the
whole
of
the
seats
on
the
scaffolds
,
previously
described
,
were
filled
with
bright
-
eyed
beauties
,
whose
looks
and
plaudits
stimulated
to
deeds
of
high
emprise
the
knights
,
who
styled
themselves
their
"
servants
,
"
and
besought
"
favours
"
from
them
in
the
shape
of
a
scarf
,
a
veil
,
a
sleeve
,
a
bracelet
,
a
ringlet
,
or
a
knot
of
ribands
.
<EOS>
At
such
times
Henry
himself
would
enter
the
lists
;
and
,
in
his
earlier
days
,
and
before
he
became
too
unwieldy
for
active
exertion
,
no
ruder
antagonist
with
the
lance
or
sword
could
be
found
than
he
.
<EOS>
Men
indeed
,
existed
in
his
days
,
very
different
in
hardihood
of
frame
and
personal
strength
from
the
silken
sybarites
,
enervated
by
constant
riot
and
dissipation
,
who
aped
the
deeds
of
arms
of
their
grandfathers
in
the
time
of
James
the
First
.
<EOS>
But
the
tilt
-
yard
was
by
no
means
neglected
by
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
This
lion
-
hearted
queen
encouraged
a
taste
for
chivalrous
displays
,
and
took
almost
as
much
delight
in
such
exhibitions
as
her
stalwart
sire
.
<EOS>
During
her
long
reign
no
festivity
was
thought
complete
unless
jousting
was
performed
.
<EOS>
The
name
of
the
gallant
Sir
Philip
Sidney
need
only
be
mentioned
,
to
show
that
she
possessed
at
least
one
perfect
"
mirror
of
chivalry
"
amongst
her
courtiers
;
but
her
chief
favourites
,
Essex
and
Leicester
,
were
both
distinguished
for
knightly
prowess
.
<EOS>
Many
a
lance
was
splintered
by
them
in
her
honour
.
<EOS>
When
the
French
Embassy
arrived
in
London
to
treat
of
a
marriage
between
Elizabeth
and
the
Duc
d'Anjou
,
and
when
a
grand
temporary
banqueting
-
house
,
three
hundred
and
thirty
feet
long
,
and
covered
with
canvas
,
was
improvised
for
the
occasion
,
a
magnificent
tournament
was
given
in
the
tilt
-
yard
in
honour
of
the
distinguished
visitors
.
<EOS>
Old
Holinshed
tells
us
,
that—"the
gallery
or
place
at
the
end
of
the
tilt
-
yard
,
adjoining
to
her
Majesty
's
house
at
Whitehall
,
where
,
as
her
person
should
be
placed
,
was
called
,
and
not
without
cause
,
the
Castle
or
Fortress
of
Perfect
Beauty
,
for
as
much
as
her
highness
should
be
there
included
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
also
gives
a
curious
description
of
the
framework
used
by
the
besiegers
of
the
fortress
.
<EOS>
"
They
had
provided
,
"
he
says
,
"
a
frame
of
wood
,
which
was
covered
with
canvas
,
and
painted
outwardly
in
such
excellent
order
,
as
if
it
had
been
very
natural
earth
or
mould
,
and
carried
the
name
of
a
rolling
-
trench
,
which
went
on
wheels
which
way
soever
the
persons
within
did
drive
it
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
top
thereof
were
placed
two
cannons
of
wood
,
so
passing
well
coloured
,
as
they
seemed
to
be
,
indeed
,
two
fair
field
pieces
of
ordnance
;
and
by
them
were
placed
two
men
for
gunners
,
clothed
in
crimson
sarcenet
,
with
their
baskets
of
earth
for
defence
of
their
bodies
by
them
.
<EOS>
And
also
there
stood
on
the
top
of
the
trench
an
ensign
-
bearer
,
in
the
same
suit
with
the
gunners
,
displaying
his
ensign
,
and
within
the
said
trench
was
cunningly
conveyed
divers
kinds
of
most
excellent
music
against
the
Castle
of
Beauty
.
<EOS>
These
things
thus
all
in
readiness
,
the
challengers
approached
,
and
came
down
the
stable
toward
the
tilt
-
yard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
challengers
were
the
Earl
of
Arundel
,
Lord
Windsor
,
Sir
Philip
Sidney
,
and
Sir
Fulke
Greville
;
and
the
defenders
were
very
numerous
,
and
amongst
them
was
the
doughty
Sir
Harry
Lee
,
who
,
as
the
"
unknown
knight
,
"
broke
"
six
staves
right
valiantly
.
<EOS>
"
All
the
speeches
made
by
the
challengers
and
defenders
are
reported
by
Holinshed
,
who
thus
winds
up
his
description
of
the
first
day
's
triumph:—"These
speeches
being
ended
,
both
they
and
the
rest
marched
about
the
tilt
-
yard
,
and
so
going
back
to
the
nether
end
thereof
,
prepared
themselves
to
run
,
every
one
in
his
turn
,
each
defendant
six
courses
against
the
former
challengers
,
who
performed
their
parts
so
valiantly
on
both
sides
,
that
their
prowess
hath
demerited
perpetual
memory
,
and
worthily
won
honour
,
both
to
themselves
and
their
native
country
,
as
fame
hath
<EOS>
the
same
reported
.
<EOS>
"
And
of
the
second
day
he
thus
writes:—"Then
went
they
to
the
tourney
,
where
they
did
very
nobly
,
as
the
shivering
of
the
swords
might
very
well
testify
;
and
after
that
to
the
barriers
,
where
they
lashed
it
out
lustily
,
and
fought
courageously
,
as
if
the
Greeks
and
Trojans
had
dealt
their
deadly
dole
.
<EOS>
No
party
was
spared
,
no
estate
excepted
,
but
each
knight
endeavoured
to
win
the
golden
fleece
,
that
expected
either
fame
or
the
favour
of
his
mistress
,
<EOS>
which
sport
continued
all
the
same
day
.
<EOS>
"
These
pageantries
were
of
frequent
occurrence
,
and
the
pages
of
the
picturesque
old
chronicler
above
-
cited
abound
with
descriptions
of
them
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
Elizabeth
to
maintain
its
splendour
undiminished
,
the
star
of
chivalry
was
rapidly
declining
,
to
disappear
for
ever
in
the
reign
of
her
successor
.
<EOS>
The
glitter
of
burnished
steel
,
the
clash
of
arms
,
the
rude
encounter
,
and
all
other
circumstances
attendant
upon
the
arena
of
martial
sport
,
that
had
given
so
much
delight
to
his
predecessors
,
afforded
little
pleasure
to
James
;
as
how
should
they
,
to
a
prince
whose
constitutional
timidity
was
so
great
that
he
shuddered
at
the
sight
of
a
drawn
sword
,
and
abhorred
the
mimic
representations
of
warfare
!
<EOS>
Neither
were
the
rigorous
principles
of
honour
on
which
chivalry
was
based
,
nor
the
obligations
they
imposed
,
better
suited
to
him
.
<EOS>
Too
faithless
by
nature
to
adopt
the
laws
of
a
Court
of
Honour
,
he
derided
the
institution
as
obsolete
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
as
trials
of
skill
and
strength
in
the
tilt
-
yard
were
still
in
fashion
,
he
was
compelled
,
though
against
his
inclination
,
to
witness
them
,
and
in
some
degree
to
promote
them
.
<EOS>
The
day
of
his
accession
to
the
throne
—
the
24th
March
—
was
always
celebrated
by
tilting
and
running
at
the
ring
,
and
similar
displays
were
invariably
made
in
honour
of
any
important
visitor
to
the
court
.
<EOS>
Even
in
this
reign
something
of
a
revival
of
the
ancient
ardour
for
knightly
pastimes
took
place
during
the
brief
career
of
Prince
Henry
,
who
,
if
he
had
lived
to
fulfil
the
promise
of
his
youth
,
would
have
occupied
a
glorious
page
in
his
country
's
annals
,
and
have
saved
it
,
in
all
probability
,
from
its
subsequent
convulsions
and
intestine
strife
.
<EOS>
Inuring
himself
betimes
to
the
weight
of
armour
,
this
young
prince
became
exceedingly
expert
in
the
use
of
all
weapons
—
could
toss
the
pike
,
couch
the
lance
,
and
wield
the
sword
,
the
battle
-
axe
,
or
the
mace
,
better
than
any
one
of
his
years
.
<EOS>
The
tilt
-
yard
and
the
tennis
-
court
were
his
constant
places
of
resort
,
and
he
was
ever
engaged
in
robust
exercises
—
too
much
so
,
indeed
,
for
a
somewhat
feeble
constitution
.
<EOS>
Prince
Henry
indulged
the
dream
of
winning
back
Calais
from
France
,
and
would
no
doubt
have
attempted
the
achievement
if
he
had
lived
.
<EOS>
Of
a
more
reflective
cast
of
mind
than
his
elder
brother
,
and
with
tastes
less
martial
,
Prince
Charles
still
sedulously
cultivated
all
the
accomplishments
,
proper
to
a
cavalier
.
<EOS>
A
perfect
horseman
,
and
well
skilled
in
all
the
practices
of
the
tilt
-
yard
<EOS>
—
he
was
a
model
of
courtesy
and
grace
;
but
he
had
not
Prince
Henry
's
feverish
and
consuming
passion
for
martial
sports
,
nor
did
he
,
like
him
,
make
their
pursuit
the
sole
business
of
life
.
<EOS>
Still
,
the
pure
flame
of
chivalry
burnt
within
his
breast
,
and
he
fully
recognised
its
high
and
ennobling
principles
,
and
accepted
the
obligations
they
imposed
.
<EOS>
And
in
this
respect
,
as
in
most
others
,
he
differed
essentially
from
his
august
father
.
<EOS>
The
tilt
-
yard
,
and
the
various
buildings
adjoining
it
,
already
enumerated
,
were
approached
by
two
fine
gates
,
likewise
erected
by
Henry
VIII
.
<EOS>
,
one
of
which
,
of
extraordinary
beauty
,
denominated
the
Cock
-
pit
Gate
,
was
designed
by
the
celebrated
painter
,
Hans
Holbein
.
<EOS>
From
an
authority
we
learn
that
it
was
"
built
of
square
stone
,
with
small
squares
of
flint
boulder
,
very
neatly
set
;
and
that
it
had
also
battlements
,
and
four
lofty
towers
,
the
whole
being
enriched
with
bustos
,
roses
,
and
portcullises
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
other
gate
,
scarcely
less
beautiful
,
and
styled
the
Westminster
Gate
,
was
adorned
with
statues
and
medallions
,
and
the
badges
of
the
royal
house
of
Tudor
carved
in
stone
.
<EOS>
Viewed
from
the
summit
of
one
of
the
tall
turrets
of
the
Holbein
Gate
,
the
appearance
of
the
palace
of
Whitehall
,
at
the
period
of
our
history
,
was
exceedingly
picturesque
and
striking
—
perhaps
more
so
than
at
any
previous
or
subsequent
epoch
,
since
the
various
structures
of
which
it
was
composed
were
just
old
enough
to
have
acquired
a
time
-
honoured
character
,
while
they
were
still
in
tolerable
preservation
.
<EOS>
Let
us
glance
at
it
,
then
,
from
this
point
,
and
first
turn
towards
the
great
Banqueting
House
,
which
presents
to
us
a
noble
and
lengthened
façade
,
and
contains
within
a
magnificent
and
lofty
hall
,
occupying
nearly
its
full
extent
,
besides
several
other
apartments
of
regal
size
and
splendour
.
<EOS>
In
this
building
,
in
former
days
,
with
a
retinue
as
princely
as
that
of
the
King
himself
,
Wolsey
so
often
and
so
sumptuously
entertained
his
royal
master
,
that
he
at
last
provoked
his
anger
by
his
ostentation
,
and
was
bereft
of
his
superb
abode
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
with
our
examination
of
the
Banqueting
House
,
we
will
suffer
our
gaze
to
fall
upon
the
broad
court
beyond
it
,
and
upon
the
numerous
irregular
but
picturesque
and
beautiful
structures
by
which
that
court
—
quadrangle
it
can
not
be
called
,
for
no
uniformity
is
observed
in
the
disposition
of
the
buildings
—
is
surrounded
.
<EOS>
Here
the
eye
is
attracted
by
a
confused
mass
of
roofs
,
some
flat
,
turreted
and
embattled
,
some
pointed
,
with
fantastical
gables
and
stacks
of
tall
chimneys
—
others
with
cupolas
and
tall
clock
-
towers
—
others
with
crocketed
pinnacles
,
and
almost
all
with
large
gilt
vanes
.
<EOS>
A
large
palace
is
a
city
in
miniature
;
and
so
is
it
with
Whitehall
.
<EOS>
It
has
two
other
courts
besides
the
one
we
are
surveying
;
equally
crowded
round
with
buildings
,
equally
wanting
in
uniformity
,
but
equally
picturesque
.
<EOS>
On
the
east
it
extends
to
Scotland
Yard
,
and
on
the
west
to
the
open
space
in
front
of
Westminster
Hall
.
<EOS>
The
state
apartments
face
the
river
,
and
their
large
windows
look
upon
the
stream
.
<EOS>
Quitting
the
exalted
position
we
have
hitherto
assumed
,
and
viewing
Whitehall
from
some
bark
on
the
Thames
,
we
shall
find
that
it
has
a
stern
and
sombre
look
,
being
castellated
,
in
part
,
with
towers
like
those
over
Traitor
's
Gate
,
commanding
the
stairs
that
approach
it
from
the
river
.
<EOS>
The
Privy
Gardens
are
beautifully
laid
out
in
broad
terrace
walks
,
with
dainty
parterres
,
each
having
a
statue
in
the
midst
,
while
there
is
a
fountain
in
the
centre
of
the
inclosure
.
<EOS>
In
addition
to
the
gardens
,
and
separated
from
them
by
an
avenue
of
tall
trees
,
is
a
spacious
bowling
-
green
.
<EOS>
Again
changing
our
position
,
we
discover
,
on
the
south
of
the
gardens
,
and
connected
with
the
state
apartments
,
a
long
ambulatory
,
called
the
Stone
Gallery
.
<EOS>
Then
returning
to
our
first
post
of
observation
,
and
taking
a
bird's
-
eye
view
of
the
whole
,
after
examining
it
in
detail
,
as
before
mentioned
,
we
come
to
the
conclusion
,
that
,
though
irregular
in
the
extreme
,
and
with
no
pretension
whatever
to
plan
in
its
arrangement
,
the
Palace
of
Whitehall
is
eminently
picturesque
,
and
imposing
from
its
vast
extent
.
<EOS>
If
taken
in
connection
with
Westminster
Hall
,
the
Parliament
House
,
and
the
ancient
Abbey
—
with
the
two
towering
gateways
,
on
one
of
which
we
,
ourselves
,
are
perched
—
with
the
various
structures
appertaining
to
it
,
and
skirting
Saint
James
's
Park
,
and
with
the
noble
gothic
cross
at
Charing
,
we
are
fain
to
acknowledge
,
that
it
constitutes
a
very
striking
picture
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
IX.Prince
Charles
.
<EOS>
There
is
now
great
stir
within
the
palace
,
and
its
principal
court
is
full
of
horsemen
,
some
of
them
apparelled
in
steel
,
and
with
their
steeds
covered
with
rich
trappings
,
and
all
attended
by
pages
and
yeomen
in
resplendent
liveries
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
,
there
are
trumpeters
in
crimson
cassocks
,
mounted
on
goodly
horses
,
and
having
their
clarions
adorned
with
silken
pennons
,
on
which
the
royal
arms
are
broidered
.
<EOS>
Then
there
are
kettle
-
drummers
and
other
musicians
,
likewise
richly
arrayed
and
well
mounted
,
and
the
various
pages
,
grooms
,
and
officers
belonging
to
the
Prince
of
Wales
,
standing
around
his
charger
,
which
is
caparisoned
with
white
and
gold
.
<EOS>
Distinguishable
even
amidst
this
brilliant
and
knightly
throng
is
Sir
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
.
<EOS>
Mounted
upon
a
fiery
Spanish
barb
,
presented
to
him
by
the
Conde
de
Gondomar
,
he
is
fully
equipped
for
the
jousts
.
<EOS>
The
trappings
of
his
steed
are
black
and
white
velvet
,
edged
with
silver
,
and
the
plumes
upon
his
helmet
are
of
the
same
colours
,
mingled
.
<EOS>
He
is
conversing
with
the
Spanish
Ambassador
,
who
,
like
all
the
rest
,
is
superbly
attired
,
though
not
in
armour
,
and
is
followed
by
a
crowd
of
lacqueys
in
jerkins
and
hose
of
black
satin
,
guarded
with
silver
.
<EOS>
An
unusual
degree
of
bustle
proclaims
the
approach
of
some
personage
of
extraordinary
importance
.
<EOS>
This
is
soon
made
known
to
be
the
Marquis
of
Buckingham
.
<EOS>
His
arrival
is
announced
by
loud
flourishes
from
the
six
mounted
trumpeters
by
whom
he
is
preceded
.
<EOS>
Their
horses
are
caparisoned
with
orange
-
coloured
taffeta
,
while
they
themselves
are
habited
in
gaberdines
of
the
same
stuff
.
<EOS>
After
the
trumpeters
come
four
gentlemen
ushers
,
and
four
pages
,
mounted
on
his
spare
horses
,
and
habited
in
orange
-
coloured
doublets
and
hose
,
with
yellow
plumes
in
their
caps
.
<EOS>
To
them
succeed
the
grooms
in
mandilions
,
or
loose
sleeveless
jackets
,
leading
the
Marquis
's
charger
,
which
is
to
run
in
the
lists
—
a
beautiful
dark
bay
jennet
—
trapped
with
green
velvet
,
sewn
with
pearls
,
and
pounced
with
gold
.
<EOS>
Next
comes
Buckingham
himself
,
in
a
magnificent
suit
of
armour
,
engraved
and
damaskeened
with
gold
,
with
an
aigret
of
orange
feathers
nodding
on
his
casque
.
<EOS>
Thus
apparelled
,
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
a
nobler
or
more
chivalrous
figure
than
he
presents
.
<EOS>
Though
completely
cased
in
steel
,
his
magnificent
person
seems
to
have
lost
none
of
its
freedom
of
movement
,
and
he
bears
himself
with
as
much
grace
and
ease
as
if
clad
in
his
customary
habiliments
of
silk
and
velvet
.
<EOS>
For
the
moment
he
rides
a
sorrel
horse
,
whose
spirit
is
too
great
to
allow
him
to
be
safely
depended
upon
in
the
lists
,
but
who
now
serves
by
his
fire
and
impetuosity
to
display
to
advantage
his
rider
's
perfect
management
.
<EOS>
Buckingham
is
followed
by
thirty
yeomen
,
apparelled
like
the
pages
,
and
twenty
gentlemen
in
short
cloaks
and
Venetian
hose
.
<EOS>
He
acknowledges
the
presence
of
his
antagonist
and
the
Spanish
Ambassador
,
with
a
courteous
salutation
addressed
to
each
,
and
then
riding
forward
,
takes
up
a
position
beside
the
Duke
of
Lennox
,
who
,
mounted
and
fully
equipped
,
and
having
his
five
companions
-
at
-
arms
with
him
,
is
awaiting
the
coming
forth
of
Prince
Charles
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Lennox
is
very
sumptuously
arrayed
in
armour
,
partly
blue
,
and
partly
gilt
and
graven
,
and
his
charger
is
caparisoned
with
cloth
of
gold
,
embroidered
with
pearls
.
<EOS>
Besides
this
he
has
four
spare
horses
,
led
by
his
pages
,
in
housings
equally
gorgeous
and
costly
.
<EOS>
These
pages
have
cassock
coats
,
and
Venetian
hose
,
of
cloth
of
silver
,
laid
with
gold
lace
,
and
caps
with
gold
bands
and
white
feathers
,
and
white
buskins
.
<EOS>
His
rétinue
consists
of
forty
gentlemen
and
yeomen
,
and
four
trumpeters
.
<EOS>
His
companions
-
at
-
arms
are
all
splendidly
accoutred
,
and
mounted
on
richly
-
caparisoned
chargers
.
<EOS>
The
most
noticeable
figure
amongst
them
,
however
,
is
that
of
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
;
and
he
attracts
attention
from
the
circumstance
of
his
armour
being
entirely
sable
,
his
steed
jet
black
,
and
his
housings
,
plumes
,
and
all
his
equipments
of
the
same
sombre
hue
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
a
page
,
in
the
Prince
's
livery
of
white
and
gold
,
approaches
Sir
Jocelyn
,
and
informs
him
that
his
highness
desires
to
speak
with
him
before
they
proceed
to
the
tilt
-
yard
.
<EOS>
On
receiving
the
summons
the
young
knight
immediately
quits
De
Gondomar
,
and
,
following
the
page
to
the
doorway
leading
to
the
state
apartments
,
dismounts
at
the
steps
,
leaving
his
steed
in
charge
of
his
youthful
companion
.
<EOS>
On
entering
the
vestibule
he
finds
a
large
party
assembled
,
comprising
some
of
the
fairest
dames
of
court
,
and
several
noble
gallants
,
who
intend
taking
no
other
part
than
that
of
spectators
in
the
approaching
tilting
-
match
.
<EOS>
Most
of
them
are
known
to
Sir
Jocelyn
,
and
they
eagerly
crowd
round
him
,
fearing
something
may
have
occurred
to
interfere
with
the
proceedings
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
The
young
knight
allays
their
apprehensions
,
and
after
experiencing
the
kindling
influence
always
produced
by
the
smiles
of
the
fair
,
begins
to
ascend
the
great
staircase
,
and
has
nearly
reached
the
door
at
its
head
,
communicating
with
the
Stone
Gallery
,
when
it
is
thrown
open
by
an
usher
,
and
Prince
Charles
comes
forth
.
<EOS>
The
noble
countenance
of
Prince
Charles
is
stamped
with
the
same
gravity
,
and
slightly
touched
with
the
same
melancholy
,
which
distinguished
his
features
through
life
,
but
which
naturally
deepened
as
misfortune
fell
upon
him
.
<EOS>
But
as
those
dark
days
can
not
now
be
discerned
,
and
,
as
all
seems
brilliant
around
him
,
and
full
of
brightest
promise
,
this
prophetic
melancholy
is
thought
to
lend
interest
to
his
handsome
features
.
<EOS>
He
is
attired
in
a
suit
of
black
armour
of
exquisite
workmanship
,
lacking
only
the
helmet
,
which
is
carried
by
a
page
—
as
are
the

the

garde
,
intended
to
be
worn
in
the
field
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
Sir
Jocelyn
,
he
pauses
,
and
signs
to
his
attendants
to
stand
back
.
<EOS>
"I
have
sent
for
you
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
"
he
said
,
"
to
ascertain
whether
it
is
true
that
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
is
amongst
the
Duke
of
Lennox
's
party
.
<EOS>
""It
is
perfectly
true
,
your
highness
,
"
replied
Sir
Jocelyn
;
"
he
is
now
in
the
court
-
yard
.
<EOS>
"A
shade
of
displeasure
crossed
the
Prince
's
noble
countenance
,
and
his
brow
darkened
.
<EOS>
"I
am
sorry
to
hear
it
;
and
but
that
I
should
grievously
offend
the
King
,
my
father
<EOS>
,
I
would
forbid
him
to
take
part
in
the
jousts
,
"
he
cried
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
deserves
to
be
degraded
from
knighthood
,
rather
than
enjoy
any
of
its
honourable
privileges
.
<EOS>
""Entertaining
<EOS>
these
sentiments
,
if
your
highness
will
make
them
known
to
the
King
,
he
will
doubtless
order
Sir
Giles
's
immediate
withdrawal
from
the
lists
,
"
said
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"
Most
assuredly
he
is
unworthy
to
enter
them
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
so
,
"
rejoined
the
Prince
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
represented
the
matter
to
his
Majesty
,
and
trusted
my
remonstrances
would
be
attended
to
.
<EOS>
But
I
find
they
have
proved
ineffectual
.
<EOS>
Buckingham
,
it
appears
,
has
more
weight
than
I
have
.
<EOS>
Yet
this
notorious
extortioner
's
insolence
and
presumption
ought
not
to
pass
unpunished
.
<EOS>
""They
<EOS>
shall
not
,
your
highness
,
"
replied
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
so
deal
with
him
that
I
will
warrant
he
will
never
dare
show
himself
within
the
precincts
of
the
palace
again
.
<EOS>
""Do
nothing
rashly
,
"
said
the
Prince
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
disguise
from
yourself
that
you
may
displease
the
King
,
and
provoke
Buckingham
's
animosity
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
help
it
,
"
returned
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
insult
him
,
if
he
crosses
my
path
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
blame
you
,
"
said
the
Prince
.
<EOS>
"
In
your
position
I
should
do
the
same
;
and
I
am
only
restrained
by
the
injunctions
laid
upon
me
by
the
King
,
from
commanding
his
instant
departure
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
proceed
towards
the
tilt
-
yard
.
<EOS>
We
shall
meet
again
anon
.
<EOS>
"With
this
<EOS>
he
descended
the
staircase
;
and
as
soon
as
his
train
of
gentlemen
-
ushers
and
pages
had
passed
on
,
Sir
Jocelyn
followed
,
and
making
his
way
through
the
still
-
crowded
vestibule
,
gained
the
door
,
and
vaulted
on
the
back
of
his
steed

CHAPTER
X.The
Old
Palace
-
Yard
of
Westminster
.
<EOS>
The
throng
outside
the
gates
of
Whitehall
felt
their
breasts
dilate
,
and
their
pulses
dance
,
as
they
listened
to
the
flourishes
of
the
trumpets
and
cornets
,
the
thundering
bruit
of
the
kettle
-
drums
,
and
other
martial
music
that
proclaimed
the
setting
forth
of
the
steel
-
clad
champions
who
were
presently
to
figure
in
the
lists
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
in
sooth
,
a
goodly
sight
to
see
the
long
and
brilliant
procession
formed
by
the
fourteen
knights
,
each
so
gallantly
mounted
,
so
splendidly
accoutred
,
and
accompanied
by
such
a
host
of
gentlemen
ushers
,
pages
,
yeomen
,
and
grooms
,
some
on
horseback
,
and
some
on
foot
;
and
the
eye
of
the
looker
-
on
was
never
wearied
of
noticing
the
diversity
of
their
habiliments,—some
of
the
knights
having
cuirasses
and
helmets
,
polished
as
silver
,
and
reflecting
the
sun
's
rays
as
from
a
mirror,—some
,
russet
-
coloured
armour,—some
,
blue
harness,—some
,
fluted,—some
<EOS>
,
corslets
damaskeened
with
gold
,
and
richly
ornamented,—others
,
black
and
lacquered
breastplates
,
as
was
the
case
with
the
harness
of
<EOS>
Prince
Charles,—and
one
,
a
dead
black
coat
of
mail
,
in
the
instance
of
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
The
arms
of
each
were
slightly
varied
,
either
in
make
or
ornament
.
<EOS>
A
few
wore
sashes
across
their
breastplates
,
and
several
had
knots
of
ribands
tied
above
the
coronals
of
their
lances
,
which
were
borne
by
their
esquires
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
give
the
vast
crowd
assembled
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Whitehall
,
an
opportunity
of
witnessing
as
much
as
possible
of
the
chivalrous
spectacle
,
it
was
arranged
by
Prince
Charles
that
the
line
of
the
procession
should
first
take
its
course
through
the
Holbein
Grate
,
and
then
,
keeping
near
the
wall
of
the
Privy
Garden
,
should
pass
beneath
the
King
's
Gate
and
draw
up
for
a
short
time
in
the
Old
Palace
-
yard
near
Westminster
-
hall
,
where
a
great
concourse
was
assembled
,
amidst
which
a
space
was
kept
clear
by
parties
of
halberdiers
and
yeomen
of
the
guard
.
<EOS>
The
procession
was
headed
by
the
Prince
,
and
the
stately
step
of
his
milk
-
white
charger
well
beseemed
his
own
majestic
deportment
.
<EOS>
When
the
long
train
of
gentlemen
-
ushers
and
pages
accompanying
him
had
moved
on
,
so
as
to
leave
the
course
clear
for
the
next
comer
and
his
followers
,
a
young
knight
presented
himself
,
who
,
more
than
any
other
in
the
procession
,
attracted
the
attention
of
the
spectators
.
<EOS>
This
youthful
knight
's
visor
was
raised
so
as
to
disclose
his
features
,
and
these
were
so
comely
,
that
,
combined
with
his
finely
-
proportioned
figure
,
perfectly
displayed
by
his
armour
,
he
offered
an
ensemble
of
manly
attractions
almost
irresistible
to
female
eyes
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
the
grace
and
skill
which
he
exhibited
in
the
management
of
his
steed
commend
him
less
highly
to
sterner
judges
,
who
did
not
fail
to
discover
that
his
limbs
,
though
light
,
were
in
the
highest
degree
vigorous
and
athletic
,
and
they
prognosticated
most
favourably
of
his
chances
of
success
in
the
jousts
.
<EOS>
When
it
became
known
that
this
preux
chevalier
was
Sir
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
,
the
chosen
antagonist
of
Buckingham
,
still
greater
attention
was
bestowed
upon
him
;
and
as
his
good
looks
and
gallant
bearing
operated
strongly
,
as
we
have
stated
,
in
his
favour
,
many
a
good
wish
and
lusty
cheer
were
uttered
for
him
.
<EOS>
The
effect
of
all
this
excitement
among
the
crowd
on
behalf
of
Mounchensey
was
to
render
Buckingham
's
reception
by
the
same
persons
comparatively
cold
;
and
the
cheers
given
for
the
magnificent
favourite
and
his
princely
retinue
were
so
few
and
so
wanting
in
spirit
,
that
he
who
was
wholly
unaccustomed
to
such
neglect
,
and
who
had
been
jealously
listening
to
the
cheers
attending
Mounchensey
's
progress
,
was
highly
offended
,
and
could
scarcely
conceal
his
displeasure
.
<EOS>
But
if
he
was
indignant
at
his
own
reception
,
he
was
exasperated
at
the
treatment
experienced
by
his
ally
.
<EOS>
Close
behind
him
rode
a
knight
in
black
armour
,
with
a
sable
panache
on
his
helm
.
<EOS>
Stalwart
limbs
and
a
manly
bearing
had
this
knight
,
and
he
bestrode
his
powerful
charger
like
one
well
accustomed
to
the
saddle
;
but
though
no
one
could
gainsay
his
skill
as
a
horseman
,
or
his
possible
prowess
as
a
man
-
at
-
arms
,
most
thought
he
had
no
title
to
be
there
,
and
gave
unmistakable
evidence
of
their
conviction
by
groans
and
hootings
.
<EOS>
This
black
knight
was
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
,
and
very
grim
and
menacing
<EOS>
was
his
aspect
.
<EOS>
Ample
accommodation
for
the
knightly
company
and
their
attendants
,
as
well
as
for
the
multitudes
congregated
to
behold
them
was
afforded
by
the
broad
area
in
front
of
Westminster
Hall
;
nevertheless
,
as
those
in
the
rear
could
not
see
as
well
as
those
in
front
,
every
chance
elevation
offering
a
better
view
was
eagerly
seized
upon
.
<EOS>
All
the
accessible
points
of
Westminster
Hall
—
its
carved
porch
and
windows
—
were
invaded
.
<EOS>
So
were
the
gates
of
the
Old
Palace
hard
by
—
so
were
the
buttresses
of
the
Abbey
;
and
men
were
perched
,
like
grotesque
ornaments
,
on
crocketed
pinnacles
and
stone
water
-
spouts
.
<EOS>
The
tall
and
curiously
-
painted
clock
tower
,
resembling
an
Italian
campanile
,
which
then
faced
the
portals
of
Westminster
Hall
,
was
covered
with
spectators
.
<EOS>
But
the
position
most
coveted
,
and
esteemed
the
best
,
was
the
fountain
at
that
time
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
old
palace
-
yard
.
<EOS>
This
structure
,
which
was
of
great
antiquity
and
beauty
,
with
a
pointed
summit
supported
by
tall
slender
shafts
,
and
a
large
basin
beneath
,
formed
a
sort
of
pivot
,
round
which
the
procession
turned
as
it
arrived
upon
the
ground
,
and
consequently
formed
the
best
point
of
view
of
all
;
and
those
were
esteemed
highly
fortunate
who
managed
to
obtain
a
place
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Amongst
these
lucky
individuals
were
three
of
the
reader
's
acquaintances
,
and
we
think
he
will
scarce
fail
to
recognise
the
saucy
-
faced
apprentice
with
the
cudgel
under
his
arm
,
and
the
fair
-
haired
,
blue
-
eyed
,
country
-
looking
maiden
at
his
side
,
as
well
as
the
hale
old
rustic
by
whom
they
were
attended
.
<EOS>
All
three
were
delighted
with
their
position
,
and
Dick
Taverner
took
full
credit
to
himself
for
his
cleverness
in
procuring
it
for
them
.
<EOS>
As
to
pretty
Gillian
,
nothing
could
please
her
better
,
for
she
could
not
only
see
all
that
was
going
forward
,
but
everybody
could
see
her
—
even
Prince
Charles
himself
;
and
she
flattered
herself
that
she
attraeted
no
little
attention
.
<EOS>
And
now
that
the
whole
of
the
procession
had
come
up
,
the
picture
was
certainly
magnificent
,
and
well
worth
contemplation
.
<EOS>
Everything
was
favourable
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
spectacle
.
<EOS>
The
day
was
bright
and
beautiful
,
and
a
sparkling
sunshine
lighted
up
the
splendid
accoutrements
of
the
knights
,
the
gorgeous
caparisons
of
their
steeds
,
and
the
rich
habiliments
of
their
attendants
;
while
a
gentle
breeze
stirred
the
plumes
upon
the
helmets
,
and
fluttered
the
bandrols
on
their
lances
.
<EOS>
The
effect
was
heightened
by
enlivening
strains
of
minstrelsy
,
and
the
fanfares
of
the
trumpeters
.
<EOS>
The
utmost
enthusiasm
was
awakened
among
the
spectators
,
and
their
acclamations
were
loud
and
long
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
Dick
Taverner
,
who
had
been
shouting
as
lustily
as
the
rest
,
tossing
his
cap
in
the
air
,
and
catching
it
dexterously
as
it
fell
,
held
his
breath
and
clapped
his
bonnet
on
his
head
,
for
an
object
met
his
eye
which
fixed
his
attention
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
sombre
figure
of
a
knight
accoutred
in
black
armour
,
who
was
pressing
his
steed
through
the
throng
in
the
direction
of
the
fountain
.
<EOS>
His
beaver
was
up
,
and
the
sinister
countenance
was
not
unknown
to
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
"Saints
defend
us
!
"
<EOS>
he
ejaculated
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
possible
that
can
be
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
?
<EOS>
What
doth
<EOS>
he
here
amidst
this
noble
company
?
<EOS>
The
villainous
extortioner
can
not
surely
be
permitted
to
enter
the
lists
.
<EOS>
""Hold
<EOS>
your
peace
,
friend
,
if
you
are
wise
,
"
muttered
a
deep
voice
behind
him
.
<EOS>
"No
,
I
will
not
be
silent
,
"
rejoined
the
apprentice
,
without
looking
round
at
his
cautioner
,
but
keeping
his
eye
fixed
upon
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
the
felon
knight
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
afraid
of
him
.
<EOS>
Harkye
,
my
masters
,
"
he
called
,
in
a
loud
voice
,
to
those
around
him
.
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
who
that
black
raven
before
you
is
?
<EOS>
If
not
,
I
will
tell
you
.
<EOS>
He
would
peck
out
your
eyes
if
he
could
,
and
devour
you
and
your
substance
,
as
he
has
done
that
of
many
others
.
<EOS>
That
bird
of
ill
omen
is
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
""Impossible
!
"
cried
a
bystander
,
indignantly
.
"
<EOS>
Yet
,
now
I
look
again
,
'
tis
certainly
he
.
<EOS>
""As
certain
as
that
we
are
standing
here
,
"
said
the
apprentice
;
"
and
if
you
want
further
proof
,
behold
,
he
is
closing
his
visor
.
<EOS>
He
thinks
to
hide
himself
from
our
notice
;
but
the
trick
shall
not
avail
him
.
<EOS>
A
groan
for
the
knavish
extortioner
,
my
masters
—
a
deep
groan
for
Sir
Giles
Mompesson!"Thus
enjoined
,
a
great
hooting
was
made
by
the
bystanders
,
and
Sir
Giles
's
name
was
coupled
with
epithets
that
could
not
be
very
agreeable
to
his
ear
.
<EOS>
"You
were
best
let
him
alone
,
fool
,
"
cried
the
deep
voice
behind
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
only
bring
yourself
into
trouble
.
<EOS>
"IllustrationBut
<EOS>
the
apprentice
was
not
to
be
thus
advised
;
and
could
not
even
be
restrained
by
the
entreaties
of
Gillian
,
who
was
sadly
apprehensive
that
some
mischief
would
befall
him
.
<EOS>
So
conspicuous
did
he
make
himself
in
the
disturbance
,
that
at
last
Sir
Giles
rode
towards
him
,
and
singling
him
out
,
seized
him
with
his
gauntleted
hand
,
and
dragged
him
from
the
edge
of
the
fountain
.
<EOS>
Dick
struggled
manfully
to
get
free
,
but
he
was
in
a
grasp
of
iron
,
and
all
his
efforts
at
releasing
himself
were
ineffectual
.
<EOS>
He
called
on
those
near
him
to
rescue
him
,
but
they
shrank
from
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
Poor
Gillian
was
dreadfully
alarmed
.
<EOS>
She
thought
her
lover
was
about
to
be
sacrificed
to
Sir
Giles
's
resentment
on
the
spot
;
and
,
falling
on
her
knees
,
she
piteously
besought
him
to
spare
his
life
.
"For
<EOS>
shame
,
Gillian
,
"
cried
Dick
;
"
do
not
demean
yourself
thus
.
<EOS>
The
caitiff
knight
dares
not
harm
me
for
his
life
;
and
if
he
should
maltreat
me
,
I
shall
be
well
avenged
by
my
patron
,
Sir
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
.
<EOS>
I
would
my
voice
might
reach
him
—
I
should
not
long
be
kept
here
.
<EOS>
To
the
rescue
!
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
!
<EOS>
to
the
rescue
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
shouted
forth
the
young
knight
's
name
at
the
top
of
his
voice
.
"Who
<EOS>
calls
me
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Mounchensey
,
pressing
through
the
throng
in
the
direction
of
the
outcries
.
<EOS>
"I
,
your
humble
follower
,
Dick
Taverner
,
"
roared
the
apprentice
;
"
I
am
in
the
clutches
of
the
devil
,
and
I
pray
you
release
me
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
what
is
this
?
"
cried
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"
Set
him
free
,
at
once
,
Sir
Giles
,
I
command
you
.
<EOS>
""What
,
if
I
refuse
?
"
rejoined
the
other
.
<EOS>
"Then
I
will
instantly
enforce
compliance
,
"
thundered
Mounchensey
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
I
release
him
it
is
because
I
must
defend
myself
and
punish
your
insolence
,
"
cried
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
,
he
thrust
back
the
apprentice
with
such
force
that
he
would
have
fallen
to
the
ground
if
he
had
not
dropped
into
the
arms
of
his
kneeling
mistress
.
<EOS>
"Now
<EOS>
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
"
continued
Sir
Giles
,
fiercely
;
"
you
shall
answer
for
this
interference"—"Hold
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
the
authoritative
voice
of
Prince
Charles
;
"
we
must
have
no
unseemly
brawls
here
.
<EOS>
To
your
places
at
once
in
the
procession
,
Sir
Knights
.
<EOS>
We
are
about
to
set
forward
to
the
tilt
-
yard
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
gave
the
word
to
move
on
,
and
all
further
sound
of
disturbance
was
drowned
by
the
trampling
of
steeds
and
the
bruit
of
the
kettle
-
drums
,
cornets
,
and
trumpets
.
<EOS>
Nowise
disheartened
by
what
had
occurred
,
Dick
Taverner
would
have
followed
with
the
stream
,
and
carried
his
mistress
and
her
grandsire
along
with
him
;
but
the
former
had
been
so
much
terrified
by
what
had
occurred
,
that
dreading
lest
her
lover
's
imprudence
should
get
him
into
further
scrapes
,
she
positively
refused
to
proceed
any
further
.
<EOS>
"I
have
seen
quite
enough
,
"
she
cried
;
"
and
if
you
have
any
love
for
me
,
Dick
,
you
will
take
me
away
,
and
not
expose
yourself
to
further
risk
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
indeed
bent
on
going
on
,
I
shall
return
with
my
grandsire
.
<EOS>
""He
will
do
well
to
follow
your
advice
,
young
mistress
,
"
said
the
deep
voice
which
had
previously
sounded
in
Dick
's
ears
;
"
if
he
had
taken
mine
,
he
would
not
have
voluntarily
thrust
himself
into
the
fangs
of
the
tiger
,
from
which
it
is
well
for
him
that
he
has
escaped
with
a
whole
skin
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
this
was
said
,
Dick
and
his
mistress
turned
towards
the
speaker
,
and
beheld
a
tall
man
,
masked
,
and
muffled
in
a
black
cloak
.
<EOS>
"Heaven
shield
us
!
'
<EOS>
tis
the
Enemy
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Gillian
,
trembling
.
"Not
<EOS>
so
,
fair
damsel
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
disguised
personage
;
"
I
am
not
the
arch
-
enemy
of
man
,
neither
am
I
enemy
of
yours
,
nor
of
Dick
Taverner
.
<EOS>
Your
froward
lover
neglected
my
previous
caution
,
but
I
will
give
him
another
,
in
the
hope
that
you
may
induce
him
to
profit
by
it
.
<EOS>
Let
him
keep
out
of
the
reach
of
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
's
emissaries
,
or
his
wedding
-
day
will
be
longer
in
coming
than
you
both
hope
for
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
it
may
not
come
at
all
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
these
words
,
the
man
in
the
mask
mingled
with
the
crowd
,
and
almost
instantly
disappeared
,
leaving
the
young
couple
,
especially
Gillian
,
in
much
consternation
.
<EOS>
So
earnest
was
the
maiden
for
instant
departure
,
that
Dick
was
obliged
to
comply
;
and
as
the
whole
of
the
thoroughfares
about
Whitehall
were
impassable
,
they
proceeded
to
the
river
side
,
and
took
boat
for
London
Bridge
,
at
a
hostel
near
which
old
Greenford
had
put
up
his
horse
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XI.The
Tilt
-
Yard
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
procession
was
pursuing
its
slow
course
towards
the
tilt
-
yard
.
<EOS>
It
returned
by
the
route
it
had
taken
in
coming
;
but
it
now
kept
on
the
north
side
of
King
Street
,
which
thoroughfare
was
divided
in
the
midst
by
a
railing
,
and
deeply
sanded
.
<EOS>
Here
,
as
in
the
area
before
Westminster
-
hall
,
not
a
wall
,
not
a
window
,
not
a
roof
,
but
had
its
occupants
.
<EOS>
The
towers
of
the
two
great
gates
were
thronged
—
so
were
the
roofs
of
the
tennis
-
court
and
the
manége
,
and
the
summit
of
the
cock
-
pit
;
the
latter
,
indeed
,
was
a
capital
position
inasmuch
as
it
not
only
afforded
an
excellent
view
of
the
procession
,
but
commanded
the
interior
of
the
tilt
-
yard
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
,
therefore
,
that
great
efforts
should
be
made
to
obtain
a
place
upon
it
,
nor
is
it
surprising
that
our
old
friend
,
Madame
Bonaventure
,
who
had
by
no
means
lost
her
influence
among
the
court
gallants
,
though
she
lacked
,
the
support
of
Lord
Roos
,
owing
to
the
absence
of
that
young
nobleman
upon
his
travels,—it
is
not
surprising
,
we
say
,
that
she
should
be
among
the
favoured
individuals
who
had
secured
a
position
there
.
<EOS>
Undoubtedly
,
she
would
have
preferred
a
seat
amongst
the
court
dames
in
the
galleries
of
the
tilt
-
yard
,
but
as
this
was
unattainable
,
she
was
obliged
to
be
content
;
and
,
indeed
,
she
had
no
reason
to
complain
,
for
she
saw
quite
as
much
as
those
inside
,
and
was
more
at
her
ease
.
<EOS>
From
this
exalted
position
,
while
listening
to
the
inspiriting
clangour
of
the
trumpets
,
the
clattering
of
arms
,
and
the
trampling
and
neighing
of
steeds
,
Madame
Bonaventure
could
scrutinize
the
deportment
of
each
knight
as
he
issued
from
the
lofty
arch
of
the
Holbein
Gate
,
and
rode
slowly
past
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
ample
time
to
count
the
number
of
his
attendants
before
he
disappeared
from
her
view
.
<EOS>
As
Sir
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
approached
,
with
his
visor
raised
,
and
his
countenance
radiant
with
smiles
at
the
cheers
he
had
received
,
she
recognised
in
him
her
former
guest
,
and
participating
in
the
general
enthusiasm
,
prevailing
for
the
young
knight
,
she
leaned
over
the
parapet
,
and
addressed
to
him
a
greeting
so
hearty
that
it
procured
for
her
a
courteous
salutation
in
return
.
<EOS>
Enchanted
with
this
,
she
followed
with
her
eyes
the
graceful
figure
of
Sir
Jocelyn
till
it
was
lost
to
view
—
to
re
-
appear
a
moment
after
in
the
tilt
-
yard
.
<EOS>
Turning
in
this
direction,—for
<EOS>
all
her
interest
was
now
centred
in
the
young
knight,—Madame
Bonaventure
<EOS>
allowed
her
gaze
to
pass
over
the
entrance
of
the
lists
,
and
<EOS>
she
goon
espied
him
she
sought
,
in
conference
with
Prince
Charles
,
and
some
other
knights
of
his
party
.
<EOS>
Near
them
was
stationed
Garter
King
-
at
-
arms
,
apparelled
in
his
tabard
,
and
mounted
on
a
horse
covered
with
housings
of
cloth
of
gold
.
<EOS>
Glancing
round
the
inclosure
she
perceived
that
all
the
foremost
seats
in
the
galleries
and
scaffolds
set
apart
for
the
principal
court
dames
were
already
filled
,
and
she
was
quite
dazzled
with
the
galaxy
of
female
loveliness
presented
to
her
gaze
.
<EOS>
Behind
the
court
dames
were
a
host
of
fluttering
gallants
in
rich
apparel
,
laughing
and
jesting
with
them
on
the
probable
issue
of
the
contest
they
had
come
to
witness
.
<EOS>
She
then
looked
round
the
arena
.
<EOS>
Stout
barriers
of
wood
were
drawn
across
it
,
with
openings
at
either
end
for
the
passage
of
the
knights
.
<EOS>
At
these
openings
were
placed
all
the
various
officers
of
the
tilt
-
yard
,
whose
attendance
was
not
required
outside
,
including
eight
mounted
trumpeters
,
four
at
one
end
of
the
field
,
and
four
at
the
other
,
together
with
a
host
of
yeomen
belonging
to
Prince
Charles
,
in
liveries
of
white
,
with
leaves
of
gold
,
and
black
caps
,
with
wreaths
and
bands
of
gold
,
and
black
and
white
plumes
.
<EOS>
At
the
western
extremity
of
the
inclosure
stood
the
royal
gallery
,
richly
decorated
for
the
occasion
with
velvet
and
cloth
of
gold
,
and
having
the
royal
arms
emblazoned
in
front
.
<EOS>
Above
it
floated
the
royal
standard
.
<EOS>
Supported
by
strong
oaken
posts
,
and
entered
by
a
staircase
at
the
side
,
this
gallery
was
open
below
,
and
the
space
thus
left
was
sufficiently
large
to
accommodate
a
dozen
or
more
mounted
knights
,
while
thick
curtains
could
be
let
down
at
the
sides
to
screen
them
from
observation
,
if
required
.
<EOS>
Here
it
was
intended
that
the
Prince
of
Wales
and
his
six
companions
-
at
-
arms
should
assemble
,
and
wait
till
summoned
forth
from
it
by
the
marshals
of
the
field
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
similar
place
of
assemblage
for
the
Duke
of
Lennox
and
his
knights
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
tilt
-
yard
;
and
at
both
spots
there
were
farriers
,
armourers
,
and
grooms
in
attendance
,
to
render
assistance
,
if
needful
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
of
the
field
stood
an
elevated
platform
,
covered
with
a
canopy
,
and
approached
by
a
flight
of
steps
.
<EOS>
It
was
reserved
for
the
marshals
and
judges
,
and
facing
it
was
the
post
affixed
to
the
barriers
,
from
which
the
ring
,
the
grand
prize
of
the
day
,
was
suspended
,
at
a
height
exactly
within
reach
of
a
lance
.
<EOS>
Like
the
streets
without
,
the
whole
arena
was
deeply
sanded
.
<EOS>
This
was
what
Madame
Bonaventure
beheld
from
the
roof
of
the
cock
-
pit
,
and
a
very
pretty
sight
<EOS>
she
thought
it
.
<EOS>
All
things
,
it
will
be
seen
,
were
in
readiness
,
in
the
tilt
<EOS>
yard,—and
<EOS>
the
arrival
of
the
King
seemed
to
be
impatiently
expected
—
not
only
by
the
knights
who
were
eager
to
display
their
prowess
,
but
by
the
court
dames
and
the
gallants
with
them
,
as
well
as
by
all
the
officials
scattered
about
in
different
parts
of
the
field
,
and
enlivening
it
by
their
variegated
costumes
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
loud
acclamations
resounding
from
all
sides
of
the
tilt
-
yard
,
accompanied
by
flourishes
of
trumpets
,
proclaimed
the
entrance
of
the
royal
laggard
to
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
James
took
his
place
in
the
raised
seat
assigned
to
him
,
and
after
conferring
for
a
few
moments
with
the
Conde
de
Gondomar
,
who
formed
part
of
the
brilliant
throng
of
nobles
and
ambassadors
in
attendance
,
he
signified
to
Sir
John
Finett
that
the
jousting
might
commence
,
and
the
royal
pleasure
was
instantly
made
known
to
the
marshals
of
the
field
.
<EOS>
The
first
course
was
run
by
Prince
Charles
,
who
acquitted
himself
with
infinite
grace
and
skill
,
but
failed
in
carrying
off
the
ring
;
and
similar
ill
luck
befell
the
Duke
of
Lennox
.
<EOS>
The
Marquis
of
Hamilton
was
the
next
to
run
,
and
he
met
with
no
better
success
;
and
the
fourth
essay
was
made
by
Buckingham
.
<EOS>
His
career
was
executed
with
all
the
consummate
address
for
which
the
favourite
was
remarkable
,
and
it
appeared
certain
that
he
would
carry
off
the
prize
;
but
in
lowering
his
lance
he
did
not
make
sufficient
allowance
for
the
wind
,
and
this
caused
it
slightly
to
swerve
,
and
though
he
touched
the
ring
,
he
did
not
bear
it
away
.
<EOS>
The
course
,
however
,
was
considered
a
good
one
by
the
judges
,
and
much
applauded
;
but
the
Marquis
was
greatly
mortified
by
his
failure
.
<EOS>
It
now
came
to
Sir
Jocelyn
's
turn
,
and
his
breast
beat
high
with
ardour
,
as
he
prepared
to
start
on
his
career
.
<EOS>
Keeping
his
back
to
the
ring
till
the
moment
of
setting
forward
,
he
made
a
demi
-
volte
to
the
right
,
and
then
gracefully
raising
his
lance
,
as
his
steed
started
on
its
career
,
he
continued
to
hold
it
aloft
until
he
began
to
near
the
object
of
his
aim
,
<EOS>
when
he
gently
and
firmly
allowed
the
point
to
decline
over
the
right
ear
of
his
horse
,
and
adjusted
it
in
a
line
with
the
ring
.
<EOS>
His
aim
proved
so
unerring
that
he
carried
off
the
prize
,
amid
universal
applause
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XII.The
<EOS>
Tilting
Match
.
<EOS>
After
all
the
other
competitors
for
the
prize
had
essayed
a
career
within
the
arena
,
Sir
Jocelyn
's
was
held
to
be
the
best
course
run
.
<EOS>
The
ring
was
again
carried
off
both
by
the
Earl
of
Pembroke
and
Lord
Mordaunt
;
but
in
the
opinion
of
the
marshals
of
the
field
,
neither
of
those
noblemen
displayed
so
much
grace
and
skill
as
Mounchensey
:
and
the
decision
was
confirmed
by
the
King
.
<EOS>
The
applauses
which
rang
through
the
tilt
-
yard
,
on
the
announcement
that
our
handsome
young
knight
had
gained
the
first
course
,
increased
the
bitterness
of
Buckingham
's
feelings
towards
him
;
and
he
expressed
his
regrets
in
a
low
tone
to
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
that
the
combat
about
to
take
place
was
not
à
l'outrance
instead
of
being
à
plaisance
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
smiled
grimly
in
reply
.
<EOS>
Some
little
time
elapsed
,
during
which
preparations
were
made
for
the
tilting
-
match
,
and
great
excitement
pervaded
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
The
King
laughingly
inquired
of
the
Spanish
ambassador
if
he
still
felt
secure
of
winning
his
wager
,
and
was
answered
by
De
Gondomar
that
he
had
never
had
the
slightest
misgiving
on
the
subject
,
but
he
was
now
better
satisfied
than
ever
that
the
result
of
the
coming
struggle
would
justify
his
expectations
.
<EOS>
In
the
ladies
'
gallery
an
unusual
degree
of
interest
was
manifested
in
what
was
going
forward
;
and
many
a
wish
was
audibly
expressed
by
many
a
fair
dame
in
Mounchensey
's
favour
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
the
trumpets
sounded
,
and
the
cries
of
the
heralds
were
heard
,
cheering
on
the
combatants
,
as
they
prepared
to
dash
furiously
against
each
other
,
bidding
them
do
their
devoir
bravely
,
since
bright
eyes
looked
down
upon
them
.
<EOS>
These
stimulants
to
valorous
display
were
scarcely
needed
,
for
the
champions
were
eager
to
prove
their
prowess
.
<EOS>
Issuing
one
by
one
,
from
beneath
their
respective
scaffolds
,
and
curbing
the
impatience
of
their
steeds
till
they
received
from
the
marshals
permission
to
start
,
they
rushed
from
their
posts
with
lightning
swiftness
to
meet
with
a
crashing
shock
midway
.
<EOS>
Various
successes
attended
the
different
combatants
,
but
on
the
whole
the
advantage
lay
clearly
on
the
side
of
the
Duke
of
Lennox
,
none
of
whose
party
had
sustained
any
material
discomfiture
;
while
on
the
side
of
Prince
Charles
,
the
Earls
of
Montgomery
and
Rutland
had
been
unhorsed
.
<EOS>
The
interest
of
the
spectators
was
kept
in
breathless
suspense
to
the
last
,
it
being
arranged
that
the
tilting
-
match
should
close
with
the
conflict
between
Buckingham
and
Mounchensey
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
when
the
trumpets
sounded
for
the
seventh
and
last
time
,
and
the
two
knights
stationed
themselves
opposite
each
other
,
every
eye
was
intently
fixed
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Apparently
,
no
two
antagonists
could
be
better
or
more
equally
matched
than
they
were
;
and
throughout
the
whole
field
it
would
have
been
in
vain
to
search
for
another
pair
equally
gifted
by
nature
,
both
being
models
of
manly
beauty
of
feature
and
symmetry
of
frame
.
<EOS>
Indeed
they
might
have
been
cast
in
the
same
mould
,
so
nearly
alike
were
they
in
shape
and
size
;
and
if
their
armour
had
been
similar
,
and
their
steeds
corresponding
in
colour
,
they
would
have
been
undistinguishable
,
when
apart
.
<EOS>
Buckingham
in
some
respects
presented
the
nobler
figure
of
the
two
,
owing
to
his
flowing
plumes
,
his
embossed
and
inlaid
armour
,
and
the
magnificent
housings
of
his
charger
—
but
he
was
fully
rivalled
by
the
grace
and
chivalrous
air
of
his
antagonist
.
<EOS>
As
the
Marquis
,
confident
in
his
address
,
disdained
the
use
of
the
passe
-
guarde
and
the
mentonnière
,
Mounchensey
abandoned
those
defences
,
though
they
were
used
by
all
the
other
knights
,
and
placed
his
reliance
in
the
strength
of
his
breast
-
plate
and
gorget
,
and
in
the
force
of
his
right
arm
.
<EOS>
When
summoned
forth
by
the
trumpets
,
the
two
champions
executed
demi
-
voltes
with
curvets
,
and
then
stood
stock
-
still
at
either
end
of
the
barriers
.
<EOS>
Each
then
selected
a
lance
from
the
bundle
offered
them
by
the
esquires
,
and
their
choice
of
a
weapon
made
,
they
carefully
fastened
down
their
visors
,
which
up
to
this
moment
had
been
raised
.
<EOS>
Seeing
them
in
readiness
,
the
heralds
gave
the
signal
for
the
encounter
.
<EOS>
Starting
against
each
other
like
thunder
-
bolts
,
they
met
in
mid
-
career
.
<EOS>
The
shock
was
tremendous
,
and
many
a
cry
sprang
from
female
lips
,
while
bursts
of
applause
arose
from
the
hardier
spectators
.
<EOS>
Both
lances
were
shivered
,
but
the
results
of
the
strokes
dealt
on
either
side
were
widely
different
.
<EOS>
Mounchensey
maintained
his
seat
firmly
in
the
saddle
,
though
his
steed
had
been
forced
back
upon
its
haunches
by
his
opponent
's
blow
,
who
had
touched
his
gorget
;
and
riding
on
with
all
the
ease
,
vigour
,
and
grace
,
our
young
knight
had
previously
exhibited
,
he
threw
down
the
truncheon
of
his
lance
,
and
opened
his
gauntlet
to
show
that
his
hand
was
wholly
uninjured
.
<EOS>
Very
differently
had
it
fared
with
Buckingham
,
whose
defeat
was
unquestionable
.
<EOS>
Unhorsed
and
unhelmeted
,
he
was
rolled
in
the
dust
;
and
as
he
sprang
to
his
feet
,
had
the
mortification
of
hearing
the
deafening
cheers
that
greeted
his
adversary
's
triumph
.
<EOS>
Eager
to
hide
his
confusion
,
he
vaulted
upon
the
back
of
his
steed
,
which
was
brought
to
him
by
an
esquire
,
the
animal
's
flanks
still
quivering
and
reeking
from
the
terrible
shock
it
had
undergone
,
and
dashed
beneath
the
scaffold
he
had
so
lately
quitted
—
his
pride
severely
humbled
.
<EOS>
While
the
crest
-
fallen
favourite
thus
retired
to
recover
himself
,
Sir
Jocelyn
rode
slowly
towards
the
royal
gallery
.
<EOS>
Having
now
raised
his
visor
,
his
features
were
fully
revealed
to
view
,
and
perhaps
were
never
seen
to
such
advantage
as
at
this
proud
and
happy
moment
.
<EOS>
His
emotions
were
indeed
enviable
—
but
one
thing
was
wanting
to
complete
his
satisfaction
—
the
presence
of
her
,
before
whom
,
of
all
others
,
he
was
most
eager
to
distinguish
himself
.
<EOS>
What
mattered
it
that
scarves
and
kerchiefs
were
waved
to
him
by
some
of
the
fairest
dames
in
the
land
?
<EOS>
What
mattered
it
that
his
name
was
called
aloud
,
and
that
gloves
and
knots
of
ribands
fell
at
his
feet
,
as
he
rode
past
the
ladies
'
gallery
?
<EOS>
His
heart
was
untouched
by
smile
or
glance
,
and
he
paused
not
to
pick
up
one
of
the
favours
showered
upon
him
.
<EOS>
But
what
means
this
sudden
change
in
his
demeanour
?
<EOS>
Why
does
he
start
and
stop
,
and
look
inquiringly
towards
the
back
of
the
gallery
?
<EOS>
Whom
does
he
discern
amongst
that
bevy
of
beauties
?
<EOS>
Can
it
be
Aveline
?
<EOS>
And
if
so
,
how
comes
she
<EOS>
there?As
he
pauses
,
all
eyes
are
fixed
upon
her
towards
whom
his
gaze
is
directed
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
difficulty
in
detecting
the
object
of
his
regards
,
for
her
attire
is
simpler
than
that
of
all
the
glittering
dames
around
her
,
and
of
a
sadder
hue
.
<EOS>
Her
confusion
also
betrays
her
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
be
seen
by
him
<EOS>
she
came
to
see
.
<EOS>
She
would
muffle
up
her
features
,
but
it
is
too
late
;
and
she
is
not
only
fully
exposed
to
his
view
,
but
to
that
of
a
hundred
other
curious
eyes
.
<EOS>
Though
many
a
high
-
born
damsel
marvels
at
the
young
knight
's
insensibility
to
her
own
superior
attractions
,
none
can
deny
that
the
unknown
maiden
is
exquisitely
beautiful
,
and
demands
are
eagerly
made
as
to
who
she
may
be
.
<EOS>
No
one
can
answer
—
and
no
clue
is
given
by
her
companion
,
for
the
elderly
dame
by
whom
she
is
attended
,
and
who
resembles
a
duenna
,
is
likewise
unknown
to
all
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Sir
Jocelyn
recovers
his
surprise
,
he
requests
a
favour
from
the
lady
of
his
love
,
and
she
can
not
refuse
him
—
for
immediately
all
the
dames
in
front
of
the
gallery
move
aside
,
to
let
her
advance
.
<EOS>
With
her
pale
cheeks
crimsoned
with
blushes
,
and
her
dark
eyes
flashing
with
mingled
emotions
of
shame
and
pleasure
,
Aveline
steps
forward
—
and
having
no
other
favour
to
bestow
upon
her
knight
,
she
gives
him
her
kerchief
,
which
he
presses
to
his
lips
,
and
then
with
a
graceful
salutation
moves
forward
on
his
course
.
<EOS>
This
is
no
time
for
explanation
—
and
he
must
be
content
with
his
happiness
,
without
inquiring
how
it
has
been
procured
for
him
.
<EOS>
The
incident
,
however
,
has
been
generally
noticed
,
and
causes
a
good
deal
of
speculation
and
talk
amongst
the
female
portion
of
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
There
is
one
individual
,
however
,
of
the
opposite
sex
,
who
witnesses
it
with
sentiments
different
from
those
by
which
most
other
observers
are
affected
.
<EOS>
This
is
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
He
,
it
appears
,
has
not
been
unaware
of
Aveline
's
presence
at
the
jousts
,
though
he
did
not
anticipate
its
revelation
in
this
manner
to
Sir
Jocelyn
;
and
a
bitter
smile
crosses
his
lips
,
as
he
watches
the
brief
interview
between
the
pair
.
<EOS>
He
cares
not
what
transports
they
indulge
in
now
—
nor
what
hopes
they
form
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
He
promises
himself
that
he
will
effectually
mar
their
bliss!CHAPTER
XIII.The
Felon
Knight
.
<EOS>
A
few
more
bounds
of
his
steed
brought
Sir
Jocelyn
to
the
royal
gallery
,
where
he
dismounted
,
and
leaving
his
steed
in
charge
of
an
esquire
,
ascended
the
stairs
in
company
with
the
marshals
of
the
field
,
and
presently
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
the
King
.
<EOS>
James
received
him
very
graciously
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
of
the
monarch
stood
the
Conde
de
Gondomar
,
who
smiled
on
his
protégé
as
he
approached
,
and
glanced
at
a
silver
coffer
full
of
diamonds
,
pearls
,
emeralds
,
amethysts
,
and
other
precious
stones
,
borne
by
an
attendant
in
the
gorgeous
livery
of
the
Marquis
of
Buckingham
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
greet
ye
as
victor
,
Sir
Jocelyn
<EOS>
,
"
said
James
,
as
the
young
knight
made
a
profound
obeisance
to
him
;
"
and
it
rejoices
us
to
say
ye
hae
demeaned
yourself
honourably
and
fairly
in
the
field
.
<EOS>
How
say
ye
,
Sirs
?
<EOS>
"
he
added
to
the
marshals
and
others
.
"
<EOS>
Shall
not
the
prize
of
the
day
be
adjudged
to
Sir
Jocelyn?""It
must
be
so
,
of
right
,
your
Majesty
,
"
replied
the
foremost
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
A
better
course
at
the
ring
could
not
be
run
than
Sir
Jocelyn
hath
performed
,
nor
could
greater
'
vantage
be
gained
in
the
jousts
than
he
hath
obtained
over
the
Marquis
of
Buckingham
.
<EOS>
All
has
been
done
by
him
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
honour
,
and
without
fraud
or
supercherie
.
<EOS>
"Enough
<EOS>
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
James
.
<EOS>
"
Count
,
ye
hae
won
your
wager
;
and
as
to
you
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
ye
hae
proved
yourself
a
very
mirror
of
chivalry
—
exemplar
antiquoe
fortitudinis
et
magnanimitatis
—
on
the
pattern
of
Bayard
,
the
knight
without
fear
and
without
reproach
,
and
the
like
of
whom
we
scarce
expected
to
see
in
these
latter
days
.
<EOS>
You
are
right
weel
entitled
to
the
prize
ye
hae
gained
,
and
which
his
Excellency
so
honourably
assigns
to
you
.
<EOS>
""With
<EOS>
your
Majesty
's
permission
,
I
will
add
the
diamond
clasp
which
I
staked
against
the
Marquess
's
casket
of
gems
,
"
said
De
Gondomar
,
"
and
will
beseech
Sir
Jocelyn
to
wear
it
as
a
testimony
on
my
part
of
his
merit
as
a
cavalier
.
<EOS>
It
is
scarcely
too
much
to
say
for
him
,
after
his
recent
brilliant
achievements
,
that
he
takes
rank
amongst
the
foremost
of
the
distinguished
knights
encircling
your
Majesty
's
throne
.
<EOS>
""He
takes
rank
as
the
first
and
best
,
"
cried
James
,
emphatically
;
"
since
he
hath
overcome
Buckingham
,
who
till
this
day
hath
held
the
chief
place
among
our
chivalry
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
Majesty
overwhelms
me
by
your
commendations
,
"
replied
Sir
Jocelyn
;
"
and
I
can
only
say
,
in
reply
,
that
my
best
energies
shall
be
devoted
to
your
service
,
whenever
and
howsoever
called
upon
.
<EOS>
As
to
your
Excellency
's
gift
,
"
he
added
to
De
Gondomar
,
who
had
unfastened
the
glittering
clasp
and
presented
it
to
him
,
"
I
shall
ever
guard
it
,
as
a
devotee
in
your
own
sunny
land
of
Spain
would
the
most
precious
relic
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
coffer
containing
the
gems
was
then
,
upon
a
sign
from
the
King
,
delivered
to
Sir
Jocelyn
,
who
,
as
he
received
it
from
the
attendant
,
took
a
string
of
pearls
from
it
and
gave
them
to
the
marshal
,
requesting
they
might
be
offered
as
largesse
to
the
heralds
;
and
the
officer
promised
that
the
request
should
be
complied
with
.
<EOS>
Having
bestowed
a
similar
boon
upon
each
of
the
marshals
,
Mounchensey
requested
that
the
coffer
might
be
placed
in
charge
of
his
esquire
—
and
his
directions
were
complied
with
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
all
concluded
?
"
demanded
the
King
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
contest
for
the
prize
is
necessarily
decided
,
"
replied
the
marshal
;
"
but
there
yet
remains
the
combat
with
the
sword
on
horseback
,
if
it
pleases
Sir
Jocelyn
to
engage
in
it
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
saith
our
young
knight
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
King
.
<EOS>
"
Is
he
willing
to
risk
the
laurels
he
hath
so
fairly
won
on
another
,
and
it
may
be
more
dangerous
encounter
?
<EOS>
What
he
hath
already
done
may
fairly
entitle
him
to
decline
further
hazard
,
if
he
be
so
minded
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
should
ill
deserve
your
Majesty
's
high
commendations
if
I
hesitated
for
a
moment
,
"
replied
Mounchensey
;
"
but
so
far
from
feeling
disinclination
to
the
combat
,
I
should
regret
if
this
opportunity
for
further
distinction
were
denied
me
.
<EOS>
With
your
Majesty
's
gracious
permission
,
I
will
pray
the
marshals
of
the
field
to
let
it
be
proclaimed
by
the
heralds
and
pursuivants
-
at
-
arms
that
I
challenge
any
true
knight
to
do
battle
with
me
with
the
sword
,
and
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
""Ye
will
fight
with
a
blunted
blade
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
"
cried
the
King
.
<EOS>
"
We
maun
hae
nae
risk
of
life
.
<EOS>
Our
dear
dog
,
Steenie
,
hath
had
his
bonnie
craig
well
-
nigh
broken
,
and
we
will
hae
nae
mair
mischief
done
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
laws
of
the
tilt
-
yard
,
with
which
Sir
Jocelyn
is
doubtless
well
acquainted
,
"
observed
the
marshal
,
"
require
that
the
edge
of
the
sword
shall
be
dull
,
as
your
Majesty
hath
stated
,
and
that
no
blow
shall
be
dealt
with
the
point
of
the
weapon
.
<EOS>
These
conditions
must
be
strictly
observed
.
<EOS>
""They
shall
be
,
"
replied
Sir
Jocelyn
;
"
and
I
pray
you
now
to
do
your
devoir
,
and
make
the
proclamation
.
<EOS>
"On
<EOS>
this
the
marshal
and
his
followers
departed
;
and
Sir
Jocelyn
,
bowing
reverently
to
the
King
,
took
his
way
after
them
,
and
descending
the
stairs
,
leaped
on
the
back
of
his
charger
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
,
and
while
a
sword
,
blunted
in
the
manner
prescribed
,
was
girded
round
his
waist
by
his
esquire
,
the
trumpets
were
sounded
,
and
the
challenge
proclaimed
by
the
marshal
.
<EOS>
It
was
immediately
responded
to
by
a
blast
from
the
opposite
end
of
the
arena
,
and
a
herald
,
stationed
at
this
point
,
called
out
in
a
loud
voice
that
the
challenge
was
accepted
.
<EOS>
Again
the
excitement
rose
high
among
the
spectators
;
again
all
eyes
were
directed
towards
Sir
Jocelyn
;
and
again
many
ardent
aspirations
were
uttered
by
his
numerous
fair
admirers
for
his
success,—though
none
so
fervent
as
that
breathed
by
Aveline
.
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
cast
one
glance
towards
that
part
of
the
ladies
'
gallery
where
he
knew
her
to
be
placed
,
and
then
prepared
for
his
last
essay
.
<EOS>
As
yet
,
he
knew
not
who
was
to
be
his
antagonist
;
but
when
a
knight
in
sable
armour
,
and
with
a
sable
plume
upon
his
helm
,
rode
from
beneath
the
scaffold
,
he
discovered
,
to
his
great
indignation
,
that
it
was
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
reflection
,
he
resolved
upon
a
course
of
action
.
<EOS>
When
the
signal
for
the
combat
was
given
by
the
marshal
,
and
Sir
Giles
,
sword
in
hand
,
dashed
into
the
arena
,
Mounchensey
rode
towards
him
,
but
,
without
drawing
his
sword
,
and
raising
himself
in
the
saddle
,
commanded
him
in
a
thundering
voice
to
retire
.
<EOS>
The
impetuosity
of
Sir
Giles
's
career
carried
him
past
his
antagonist
,
but
he
now
wheeled
round
,
and
regarded
Mounchensey
fiercely
from
beneath
the
bars
of
his
helmet
.
<EOS>
"Retire
,
said
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
;
"
not
unless
you
acknowledge
yourself
defeated
.
<EOS>
In
my
turn
,
I
bid
you
go
back
to
the
point
you
started
from
,
and
commence
the
combat
in
due
form
,
or
I
shall
hold
you
vanquished
,
and
compel
you
to
abase
your
crest
.
<EOS>
""Hear
me
<EOS>
,
"
cried
Sir
Jocelyn
,
"
and
let
it
be
heard
by
all
.
<EOS>
I
challenged
any
true
knight
to
the
combat
,
but
you
answer
not
to
the
description
.
<EOS>
I
proclaim
you
publicly
in
this
place
as
a
false
and
felon
knight
,
and
declare
you
utterly
unworthy
of
my
sword
.
<EOS>
Back
to
your
starting
-
place
,
and
if
the
heralds
do
their
duty
,
they
will
hack
off
your
spurs
,
and
drive
you
with
shame
from
the
lists
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
think
you
I
will
tamely
brook
this
insult
?
<EOS>
"
roared
Sir
Giles
;
"
draw
your
sword
at
once
,
and
let
it
be
a
mortal
combat
between
us
.
<EOS>
""Never
,
"
replied
Sir
Jocelyn
,
disdainfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
stoop
to
the
level
of
your
infamy
.
<EOS>
""Then
stoop
to
earth
<EOS>
,
"
cried
Sir
Giles
,
aiming
a
terrible
blow
at
him
with
his
sword
.
<EOS>
If
the
stroke
had
taken
effect
as
intended
,
it
would
probably
have
made
good
Mompesson
's
threat
,
but
Sir
Jocelyn
was
too
wary
and
too
agile
even
for
his
powerful
assailant
.
<EOS>
Before
the
sword
could
descend
,
he
seized
his
adversary
's
wrist
,
and
in
another
instant
possessed
himself
of
the
blade
.
<EOS>
This
he
accomplished
without
injury
,
as
the
sword
was
blunted
.
<EOS>
Still
maintaining
his
grasp
of
the
weapon
,
he
raised
himself
in
his
stirrups
to
give
additional
force
to
the
blow
,
and
with
the
pummel
of
the
sword
,
struck
Sir
Giles
a
blow
upon
the
brainpan
with
such
violence
,
that
he
dropped
from
the
saddle
as
if
shot
.
<EOS>
During
this
strange
scene
,
not
a
word
had
been
uttered
by
the
spectators
,
who
looked
on
with
the
greatest
curiosity
,
wondering
how
it
would
end
.
<EOS>
As
Sir
Giles
fell
from
his
horse
,
and
lay
stretched
in
perfect
insensibility
on
the
ground
,
a
tremendous
shout
was
raised
,
and
Sir
Jocelyn
was
as
much
applauded
as
if
he
had
performed
an
extraordinary
feat
—
so
universally
was
the
extortioner
detested
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
there
any
sympathy
manifested
,
when
a
few
moments
afterwards
Sir
Giles
was
raised
from
the
ground
by
the
pursuivants
,
and
his
helmet
being
removed
,
exhibited
a
countenance
livid
as
death
,
with
a
stream
of
blood
coursing
slowly
down
the
temples
.
<EOS>
Many
would
have
been
well
-
pleased
if
he
had
been
killed
outright
,
but
the
chirurgeon
in
attendance
pronounced
that
he
was
only
stunned
by
the
blow
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
XIV.The
<EOS>
Private
Cabinet
of
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
A
small
room
,
and
rendered
yet
smaller
by
the
numerous
chests
and
strong
boxes
encroaching
upon
its
narrow
limits
.
<EOS>
In
some
cases
these
boxes
are
piled
,
one
upon
another
,
till
they
touch
the
ceiling
.
<EOS>
All
of
them
look
stout
enough
,
yet
many
are
further
strengthened
by
iron
hoops
and
broad
-
headed
nails
,
and
secured
by
huge
padlocks
.
<EOS>
The
door
is
cased
with
iron
,
within
and
without
,
and
has
a
ponderous
lock
,
of
which
the
master
of
the
room
always
keeps
the
key
,
and
never
trusts
it
out
of
his
own
hand
.
<EOS>
This
small
chamber
is
the
private
cabinet
of
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
No
one
is
permitted
to
enter
it
without
him
.
<EOS>
Though
his
myrmidons
are
fully
aware
of
its
existence
,
and
can
give
a
shrewd
guess
at
its
contents
,
only
two
of
them
have
set
foot
within
it
.
<EOS>
The
two
thus
privileged
are
Clement
Lanyere
and
Lupo
Vulp
.
<EOS>
Neither
the
promoter
nor
the
scrivener
are
much
in
the
habit
of
talking
over
their
master
's
affairs
,
even
with
their
comrades
,
and
are
almost
as
habitually
reserved
as
he
is
himself
;
still
,
from
the
few
words
let
fall
by
them
from
time
to
time
,
the
myrmidons
have
picked
up
a
tolerable
notion
of
the
private
cabinet
,
of
its
hidden
cupboards
in
the
walls
,
its
drawers
with
secret
springs
;
its
sliding
planks
with
hollows
beneath
them
;
its
chests
full
of
treasure
,
or
what
is
the
same
thing
as
treasure
,
bonds
,
mortgage
-
deeds
,
and
other
securities
;
and
its
carefully
concealed
hoards
of
plate
,
jewels
,
and
other
valuables
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
least
scrupulous
among
them
—
such
as
Staring
,
Hugh
,
Cutting
Dick
,
and
old
Tom
Wootton
—
have
often
discussed
the
possibility
of
secretly
visiting
it
,
and
making
a
perquisition
of
its
stores
;
but
they
have
been
hitherto
restrained
by
their
fears
of
their
terrible
and
vindictive
master
.
<EOS>
On
looking
into
the
cabinet
we
find
Sir
Giles
seated
at
a
table
,
with
a
large
chest
open
beside
him
,
from
which
he
has
taken
for
examination
sundry
yellow
parchments
,
with
large
seals
attached
to
them
.
<EOS>
He
is
now
occupied
with
a
deed
,
on
one
of
the
skins
of
which
the
plan
of
an
important
estate
is
painted
,
and
on
this
his
attention
becomes
fixed
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
is
cadaverous
,
and
its
ghastly
hue
adds
to
its
grimness
of
expression
.
<EOS>
A
band
is
tied
round
his
head
,
and
there
is
an
expression
of
pain
in
his
face
,
and
an
air
of
languor
and
debility
in
his
manner
,
very
different
from
what
is
usual
with
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
plain
he
has
not
yet
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
crushing
blow
he
received
at
the
jousts
.
<EOS>
Opposite
him
sits
his
partner
,
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
;
and
the
silence
that
has
reigned
between
them
for
some
minutes
is
first
broken
by
the
old
usurer
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
Sir
Giles
,
"
he
inquires
,
"
are
you
satisfied
with
your
examination
of
these
deeds
of
the
Mounchensey
property
?
<EOS>
The
estates
have
been
in
the
family
,
as
you
see
,
for
upwards
of
two
centuries
—
ever
since
the
reign
of
Henry
IV
.
,
in
fact
—
and
you
have
a
clear
and
undisputed
title
to
all
the
property
depicted
on
that
plan
—
to
an
old
hall
with
a
large
park
around
it
,
eight
miles
in
circumference
,
and
almost
as
well
stocked
with
deer
as
the
royal
chase
of
Theobald
's
;
and
you
have
a
title
to
other
territorial
domains
extending
from
Mounchensey
Place
and
Park
to
the
coast
,
a
matter
of
twelve
miles
as
the
crow
flies
,
Sir
Giles,—and
including
three
manors
and
a
score
of
little
villages
.
<EOS>
Will
not
these
content
you
?
<EOS>
Methinks
they
should
.
<EOS>
I
'
faith
,
my
worthy
partner
,
when
I
come
to
reckon
up
all
your
possessions
,
your
houses
and
lands
,
and
your
different
sources
of
revenue
—
the
sums
owing
to
you
in
bond
and
mortgage
—
your
monopolies
and
your
patents
—
when
I
reckon
up
all
these
,
I
say
,
and
add
thereunto
the
wealth
hoarded
in
this
cabinet
,
which
you
have
not
placed
out
at
usance
<EOS>
—
I
do
not
hesitate
to
set
you
down
as
one
of
the
richest
of
my
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
There
be
few
whose
revenue
is
so
large
as
yours
,
Sir
Giles
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
strange
,
though
I
have
had
the
same
chance
as
yourself
of
making
money
,
I
have
not
a
hundredth
part
of
your
wealth
.
<EOS>
""Not
a
whit
strange
,
"
replied
Sir
Giles
,
laying
down
the
deed
and
regarding
his
partner
somewhat
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
I
waste
not
what
I
acquire
.
<EOS>
I
have
passions
as
well
as
yourself
,
Sir
Francis
;
but
I
keep
them
under
subjection
.
<EOS>
I
drink
not
—
I
riot
not
—
I
shun
all
idle
company
.
<EOS>
I
care
not
for
outward
show
,
or
for
the
vanities
of
dress
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
one
passion
which
I
indulge,—Revenge
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
slave
to
sensuality
,
and
pamper
your
lusts
at
any
cost
.
<EOS>
Let
a
fair
woman
please
your
eye
,
and
she
must
be
bought
,
be
the
price
what
it
may
.
<EOS>
No
court
prodigal
was
ever
more
licentious
or
extravagant
than
you
are
.
<EOS>
""Sir
Giles
!
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
!
<EOS>
I
pray
you
,
spare
me
.
<EOS>
My
enemies
could
not
report
worse
of
me
.
<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
your
enemies
would
say
that
your
extravagance
is
your
sole
merit
,
and
that
therein
you
are
better
than
I
,
"
rejoined
Sir
Giles
,
with
a
sardonic
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
rejoice
to
think
I
am
free
from
all
such
weaknesses
.
<EOS>
The
veriest
enchantress
could
not
tempt
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
proof
against
all
female
seductions
.
<EOS>
Think
you
the
damsel
lives
who
could
induce
me
to
give
for
her
half
these
broad
lands
in
Norfolk
—
this
ancient
hall
,
and
its
wide
-
spread
domains
?
<EOS>
I
trow
not
.
<EOS>
""Perchance
I
have
given
too
much
,
"
cried
the
old
usurer
,
eagerly
;
"
if
so
,
it
is
not
too
late
to
amend
our
contract
.
<EOS>
Between
us
,
there
should
be
fair
dealing
,
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
""There
is
none
other
than
fair
dealing
on
my
part
,
"
replied
the
extortioner
sternly
;
"
and
the
terms
of
our
agreement
can
not
be
departed
from
.
<EOS>
What
I
have
just
said
applies
to
your
general
mode
of
life
;
but
you
have
better
reason
for
your
conduct
in
this
instance
than
is
usual
with
you
,
since
you
combine
the
gratification
of
revenge
with
the
indulgence
of
your
other
passions
.
<EOS>
You
obtain
a
fair
young
bride
,
and
at
the
same
time
deprive
the
person
whom
you
hate
most
of
all
others
,
of
the
mistress
of
his
affections
.
<EOS>
This
is
as
it
should
be
.
<EOS>
Vengeance
can
not
be
too
dearly
purchased
,
and
the
more
refined
the
vengeance
<EOS>
,
the
higher
must
necessarily
be
the
price
paid
for
it
.
<EOS>
In
no
way
can
you
so
cruelly
injure
this
detested
Mounchensey
,
as
by
robbing
him
of
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
And
the
blow
dealt
by
you
,
shall
be
followed
by
others
not
less
severe
on
my
part
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
ay
,
Sir
Giles
,
you
have
to
wipe
out
the
outrage
he
inflicted
upon
you
in
the
tilt
-
yard
.
<EOS>
As
I
am
a
true
gentleman
,
that
was
worse
than
the
indignity
I
endured
from
him
in
the
court
-
yard
of
the
palace
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
confessed
that
the
villain
hath
a
powerful
hand
as
well
as
a
sharp
tongue
,
and
follows
up
his
bitter
words
by
bold
deeds
.
<EOS>
The
stroke
he
dealt
you
with
his
sword
was
like
a
blow
from
a
sledge
hammer
,
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
He
felled
you
from
your
horse
as
a
butcher
felleth
an
ox
;
and
,
in
good
truth
,
I
at
first
thought
the
ox
's
fate
had
been
yours
,
and
that
you
would
never
rise
again
.
<EOS>
Your
helmet
was
dinted
in
as
if
by
a
great
shot
.
<EOS>
And
for
twelve
hours
and
upwards
you
were
senseless
and
speechless;—But
thanks
to
my
care
and
the
skill
of
Luke
Hatton
the
apothecary
who
tended
you
,
you
have
been
brought
round
.
<EOS>
After
such
treatment
,
I
can
not
wonder
that
you
are
eager
for
revenge
upon
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
How
will
you
deal
with
him
Sir
Giles
?
<EOS>
How
will
you
deal
with
him?""I
will
hurl
him
from
the
proud
position
he
now
holds
,
"
replied
the
other
,
"
and
immure
him
in
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
""While
<EOS>
I
revel
in
the
bliss
he
panted
to
enjoy
,
"
cried
the
old
usurer
,
chuckling
.
<EOS>
"
Take
it
altogether
,
'
tis
the
sweetest
scheme
we
ever
planned
,
and
the
most
promising
,
Sir
Giles
!
<EOS>
But
when
am
I
to
claim
Aveline
?
<EOS>
when
shall
I
make
her
mine?""You
shall
claim
her
to
-
morrow
,
and
we
d
her
as
soon
after
as
you
list
.
<EOS>
""Nay
,
there
shall
be
no
delay
on
my
part
,
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
I
am
all
impatience
.
<EOS>
When
such
a
dainty
repast
is
spread
out
before
me
,
I
am
not
likely
to
be
a
laggard
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
to
the
all
-
important
point
on
which
the
whole
affair
hinges
!
<EOS>
How
am
I
to
assert
my
claim
to
her
hand
—
how
enforce
it
when
made
?
<EOS>
Explain
that
to
me
,
Sir
Giles
,
I
beseech
you
.
<EOS>
""Readily
,
"
replied
the
extortioner
.
"
<EOS>
But
before
doing
so
let
me
give
you
a
piece
of
information
which
will
surprise
you
,
and
which
will
show
you
that
my
tenure
of
this
great
Norfolk
property
is
not
quite
so
secure
as
you
suppose
it
.
<EOS>
You
are
aware
that
Sir
Ferdinando
Mounchensey
had
a
younger
brother
,
<EOS>
Osmond—""Who
disappeared
when
very
young
,
and
died
,
it
was
concluded
,
"
interrupted
Sir
Francis
,
"
for
he
was
never
heard
of
more
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
lucky
for
us
<EOS>
he
did
so
die
,
or
he
might
have
proved
a
serious
obstacle
to
our
seizure
of
these
estates
,
for
I
remember
it
being
stated
at
the
time
,
by
one
of
the
judges
,
that
had
he
been
living
,
he
might
have
procured
a
reversal
of
the
Star
-
Chamber
sentence
upon
Sir
Ferdinando
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
""Precisely
<EOS>
so
,
and
that
judge
's
opinion
was
correct
,
"
said
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"
Now
listen
to
me
,
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
It
is
quite
true
that
Osmond
Mounchensey
quitted
his
home
when
very
young
,
owing
to
some
family
quarrel
;
but
it
is
not
true
that
he
died
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
I
have
recently
ascertained
,
beyond
a
doubt
,
that
he
is
still
alive
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
I
have
failed
in
tracing
him
out
,
though
I
have
got
a
clue
to
him
;
but
he
has
enveloped
himself
in
so
much
mystery
that
he
is
difficult
of
detection
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
trust
to
succeed
ere
long
;
and
my
great
business
will
be
to
prevent
his
re
-
appearance
,
which
would
be
fraught
with
danger
to
us
both
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
scheme
on
foot
in
reference
to
him
which
will
answer
more
than
one
purpose
.
<EOS>
You
will
learn
it
anon

you
the

you

stamped

<EOS>
"You

not

"
said
Sir
Francis

staring
at
him
in
astonishment
and
alarm

<EOS>
"You

rejoined
the
extortioner
with
a
grim

.
<EOS>
After
a
brief
pause
,
the
door
was
almost
noiselessly
opened
,
and
Clement
Lanyere
entered
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
"What
has
Lanyere
to
do
with
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Sir
Francis
,
suspiciously
regarding
the
promoter
,
who
was
without
his
mask
.
<EOS>
"You
will
hear
,
"
replied
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"
Be
pleased
to
inform
Sir
Francis

good
Lanyere

"Let

the

Lanyere
's
Story
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
tale
shall
be
briefly
told
,
"
said
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
aware
,
Sir
Francis
,
that
in
the
pursuit
of
my
avocation
I
am
often
led
into
the
most
dangerous
quarters
of
the
metropolis
,
and
at
hours
when
the
peril
to
any
honest
man
is
doubled
.
<EOS>
Adventures
have
not
unfrequently
occurred
to
me
when
so
circumstanced
,
and
I
have
been
indebted
to
my
right
hand
and
my
good
sword
for
deliverance
from
many
a
desperate
risk
.
<EOS>
Late
one
night
,
I
chanced
to
be
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Whitefriars
,
in
a
place
called
the
Wilderness
,
when
,
hearing
cries
for
help
,
accompanied
by
the
clash
of
steel
,
I
rushed
towards
a
narrow
court
,
whence
the
clatter
and
vociferations
resounded
,
and
perceived
by
the
light
of
the
moon
,
which
fortunately
happened
to
be
shining
brightly
at
the
time
,
one
man
engaged
with
four
others
,
who
were
evidently
bent
upon
cutting
his
throat
in
order
to
take
his
purse
.
<EOS>
He
defended
himself
gallantly
,
but
the
odds
were
too
great
,
and
he
must
have
been
speedily
slain
—
for
the
villains
swore
with
great
oaths
they
would
murder
him
if
he
continued
to
resist
them
—
if
I
had
not
come
to
the
rescue
.
<EOS>
I
arrived
just
in
time
.
<EOS>
They
were
pressing
him
hard
.
<EOS>
I
struck
down
the
point
of
a
rapier
which
was
within
an
inch
of
his
breast
—
gave
the
swashbuckler
who
carried
it
a
riposta
he
did
not
expect
,
and
sent
him
off
bowling
—
and
then
addressed
myself
to
the
others
with
such
good
effect
,
that
in
a
brief
space
the
stranger
and
<EOS>
I
were
alone
together
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
slightly
wounded
in
the
fray
;
but
I
thought
nothing
of
it
—
a
mere
scratch
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
something
more
to
the
gentleman
I
had
preserved
.
<EOS>
He
expressed
great
concern
for
me
,
and
bound
his
handkerchief
round
my
arm
.
<EOS>
I
was
about
to
depart
,
but
he
detained
me
to
renew
his
professions
of
gratitude
for
the
service
I
had
rendered
him
,
and
his
earnest
wish
that
he
might
be
able
to
requite
me
.
<EOS>
From
his
discourse
,
and
from
the
texts
of
Scripture
he
mixed
up
with
it
,
I
knew
him
to
be
a
Puritan
;
and
I
might
have
supposed
him
to
be
a
preacher
of
the
Gospel
,
had
he
not
carried
a
sword
,
and
borne
himself
so
manfully
in
the
encounter
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
left
me
no
doubt
on
the
subject
,
for
he
told
me
he
was
named
Hugh
Calveley
,
and
that
he
had
served
in
the
wars
with
more
honour
to
himself
than
profit
.
<EOS>
He
added
,
that
if
the
knaves
had
succeeded
in
their
design
,
and
robbed
and
slain
him
,
they
would
have
deprived
his
daughter
of
her
sole
protector
;
and
,
indeed
,
of
all
means
of
subsistence
,
since
the
little
they
had
would
be
lost
with
him
.
<EOS>
On
hearing
this
,
a
thought
struck
me
,
and
I
said
to
him—'You
have
expressed
an
earnest
desire
to
requite
the
service
<EOS>
I
have
just
been
fortunate
enough
to
render
you
,
and
as
I
am
well
assured
your
professions
are
not
idly
made
,
I
shall
not
hesitate
to
proffer
a
request
to
you
.
'
'
<EOS>
Ask
what
you
will
;
if
I
have
it
to
give
,
it
shall
be
yours
,
'
he
replied
.
'
<EOS>
You
make
that
promise
solemnly
,
and
before
heaven
?
'
<EOS>
I
said
.
<EOS>
'
I
make
it
solemnly
,
'
he
replied
.
'
<EOS>
And
to
prove
to
you
that
I
mean
it
to
be
binding
upon
me
,
I
will
confirm
it
by
an
oath
upon
the
Bible
.
'
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
he
took
the
sacred
volume
from
his
doublet
,
and
reverently
kissed
it
.
<EOS>
Then
I
said
to
him—'Sir
,
you
have
told
me
you
have
a
daughter
,
but
you
have
not
told
me
whether
she
is
marriageable
or
not
?
'
<EOS>
He
started
at
the
question
,
and
answered
somewhat
sternly
.
'
<EOS>
My
daughter
has
arrived
at
womanhood
.
<EOS>
But
wherefore
the
inquiry
?
<EOS>
Do
you
seek
her
hand
in
marriage
?
'
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
If
I
did
so
,
would
you
refuse
her
to
me
?
'
<EOS>
A
pause
ensued
,
during
which
I
observed
he
was
struggling
with
deep
emotion
,
but
he
replied
at
last
,
'
I
could
not
do
so
after
my
solemn
promise
to
you
;
but
I
pray
you
not
to
make
the
demand
.
'
<EOS>
I
then
said
to
him
:
'
Sir
,
you
can
not
lay
any
restrictions
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
exact
fulfilment
of
your
promise
.
<EOS>
Your
daughter
must
be
mine
.
'
<EOS>
Again
he
seemed
to
be
torn
by
emotion
,
and
to
meditate
a
refusal
;
but
after
a
while
he
suppressed
his
feelings
,
and
replied
.
'
<EOS>
My
word
is
plighted
.
<EOS>
She
shall
be
yours.—Ay
,
though
it
cost
me
my
life
,
she
shall
be
yours
.
'
<EOS>
He
then
inquired
my
name
and
station
,
and
I
gave
him
a
different
name
from
that
by
which
I
am
known
;
in
fact
,
I
adopted
one
which
chanced
to
be
familiar
to
him
,
and
which
instantly
changed
his
feelings
towards
me
into
those
of
warmest
friendship
.
<EOS>
As
you
may
well
suppose
,
I
did
not
think
fit
to
reveal
my
odious
profession
,
and
though
I
was
unmasked
,
I
contrived
so
to
muffle
my
hateful
visage
with
my
cloak
,
that
it
was
in
a
great
degree
concealed
from
him
.
<EOS>
After
this
,
I
told
him
that
I
had
no
intention
of
pressing
my
demand
immediately
;
that
I
would
take
my
own
means
of
seeing
his
daughter
without
her
being
conscious
of
my
presence
;
and
that
I
would
not
intrude
upon
her
in
any
way
without
his
sanction
.
<EOS>
I
used
some
other
arguments
,
which
seemed
perfectly
to
satisfy
him
,
and
we
separated
,
he
having
previously
acquainted
me
that
he
lived
at
Tottenham
.
<EOS>
Not
many
days
elapsed
before
I
found
an
opportunity
of
viewing
his
daughter
,
and
I
found
her
exquisitely
beautiful
.
<EOS>
I
had
indeed
gained
a
prize
;
and
I
resolved
that
no
entreaties
on
his
part
,
or
on
hers
,
should
induce
me
to
abandon
my
claim
.
<EOS>
I
took
care
not
to
be
seen
by
her
,
being
sensible
that
any
impression
I
might
make
would
be
prejudicial
to
me
;
and
I
subsequently
learnt
from
her
father
that
he
had
not
disclosed
to
her
the
promise
he
had
been
rash
enough
to
make
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
an
interview
with
him
—
the
third
and
last
that
ever
took
place
between
us
—
on
the
morning
of
the
day
on
which
he
made
an
attempt
upon
the
life
of
the
King
.
<EOS>
I
rode
over
to
Tottenham
,
and
arrived
there
before
daybreak
.
<EOS>
My
coming
was
expected
,
and
he
himself
admitted
me
by
a
private
door
into
his
garden
,
and
thence
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
perceived
that
his
mind
was
much
disturbed
,
and
he
told
me
he
had
passed
the
whole
night
in
prayer
.
<EOS>
Without
acquainting
me
with
his
desperate
design
,
I
gathered
from
what
he
said
,
that
he
meditated
some
fearful
act
,
and
that
he
considered
his
own
life
in
great
jeopardy
.
<EOS>
If
he
fell
,
and
he
anticipated
he
should
fall
,
he
committed
his
daughter
to
my
care
;
and
he
gave
me
a
written
injunction
,
wherein
,
as
you
will
find
,
his
blessing
is
bestowed
upon
her
for
obedience
to
him
,
and
his
curse
laid
upon
her
in
the
event
of
a
breach
of
duty
;
commanding
her
,
by
all
her
hopes
of
happiness
hereafter
,
to
fulfil
the
solemn
promise
he
had
made
me
—
provided
I
should
claim
her
hand
within
a
twelvemonth
of
his
death
.
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
man
,
as
you
know
,
died
within
two
days
of
that
interview
,
having
,
as
I
have
since
ascertained
,
reiterated
the
same
solemn
charge
,
and
in
terms
equally
impressive
,
to
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
""A
<EOS>
strange
story
truly
,
"
observed
Sir
Francis
,
who
had
listened
attentively
to
the
relation
;
"
but
though
Aveline
may
consent
to
be
bound
by
her
father
's
promise
to
you
,
<EOS>
I
see
not
how
Lean
enforce
the
claim
.
<EOS>
""Hugh
<EOS>
Calveley
,
when
dying
,
disclosed
no
name
to
his
daughter
,
"
said
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
name
mentioned
in
the
paper
confided
by
him
to
Lanyere
;
and
,
possessed
of
that
authority
,
you
will
represent
the
party
entitled
to
make
the
claim
,
and
can
act
as
Lanyere
would
have
acted
.
<EOS>
""She
will
not
resist
the
demand
,
"
said
the
promoter
.
<EOS>
"
That
I
can
avouch
,
for
I
overheard
her
declare
as
much
to
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
such
be
the
case
<EOS>
,
I
am
content
,
"
cried
the
old
usurer
.
"
<EOS>
Give
me
the
authority
,
"
he
added
to
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
it
with
me
,
Sir
Francis
,
"
rejoined
the
promoter
;
"
but
Sir
Giles
will
explain
to
you
that
there
is
something
to
be
done
before
I
can
yield
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
does
he
require
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
old
usurer
,
glancing
uneasily
at
his
partner
.
<EOS>
"Merely
<EOS>
all
these
title
-
deeds
of
the
Mounchensey
estates
in
exchange
for
that
paper
,
"
replied
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
merely
the
deeds
,
"
said
Lanyere
;
"
but
an
assignment
on
your
part
,
Sir
Giles
,
and
on
yours
,
Sir
Francis
,
of
all
your
joint
interest
in
those
estates
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
them
absolutely
secured
to
me
;
and
stand
precisely
as
you
stand
towards
them
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
shall
have
all
you
require
,
"
replied
Mompesson
.
"Amazement
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Sir
Francis
.
"
<EOS>
Can
you
really
mean
to
relinquish
this
noble
property
to
him
,
Sir
Giles
?
<EOS>
I
thought
I
was
assigning
my
share
to
you
,
and
little
dreamed
that
the
whole
estates
would
be
made
over
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
""I
have
told
you
,
Sir
Francis
,
"
rejoined
the
other
,
"
that
vengeance
—
ample
,
refined
vengeance
—
cannot
be
too
dearly
purchased
;
and
you
will
now
perceive
that
I
am
willing
to
pay
as
extravagantly
as
yourself
for
the
gratification
of
a
whim
.
<EOS>
On
no
other
terms
than
these
would
Lanyere
consent
to
part
with
the
authority
he
possesses
,
which
while
it
will
ensure
you
the
hand
of
Aveline
,
will
ensure
me
the
keenest
revenge
upon
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
I
have
therefore
acceded
to
his
terms
.
<EOS>
Thou
hast
got
a
rare
bargain
,
Lanyere
;
and
when
the
crack
-
brained
Puritan
gave
thee
that
paper
,
he
little
knew
the
boon
he
bestowed
upon
thee
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
exchange
would
,
indeed
,
seem
to
be
in
my
favour
,
Sir
Giles
,
"
he
said
;
"
but
you
may
believe
me
when
I
say
,
that
though
I
gain
these
large
estates
,
I
would
rather
have
had
the
damsel
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
let
the
business
be
completed
,
"
said
Sir
Giles
;
"
and
that
it
may
be
so
with
all
dispatch
,
do
you
,
Lanyere
,
summon
Lupo
Vulp
to
us
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
him
in
his
chamber
,
and
bid
him
bring
with
him
the
deed
of
assignment
to
you
of
the
Mounchensey
estates
which
he
has
already
prepared
,
and
which
only
requires
my
signature
and
that
of
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
obey
you
,
Sir
Giles
,
"
replied
Lanyere
,
departing
on
the
errand
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
were
alone
,
the
old
usurer
observed
to
his
partner—"I
am
lost
in
astonishment
at
what
you
are
about
to
do
,
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
That
I
should
make
a
sacrifice
for
a
dainty
damsel
,
whose
charms
are
doubled
because
she
should
belong
to
an
enemy
,
is
not
surprising
;
but
that
you
should
give
up
so
easily
a
property
you
have
so
long
coveted
<EOS>
—
I
confess
I
can
not
understand
it
.
<EOS>
"A
<EOS>
strange
smile
crossed
the
extortioner
's
countenance
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
do
you
really
think
I
would
give
it
up
thus
,
Sir
Francis
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"But
if
we
sign
that
deed—'tis
his
.
<EOS>
How
are
you
to
get
it
back
<EOS>
again?""Ask
me
<EOS>
not
how
—
I
have
no
time
for
explanation
.
<EOS>
Recollect
what
I
told
you
of
Osmond
Mounchensey
,
and
the
possibility
of
his
re
-
appearance
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
seek
to
penetrate
your
scheme
,
Sir
Giles
,
"
observed
the
old
usurer
;
"
but
I
would
have
you
beware
of
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
He
is
cunning
and
determined
.
<EOS>
""He
will
scarcely
prove
a
match
for
me
,
I
think
,
"
observed
the
extortioner—"but
<EOS>
here
he
comes
.
<EOS>
"And
as
he
spoke
,
the
promoter
again
entered
the
chamber
,
followed
by
Lupo
Vulp
,
with
a
parchment
under
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"Give
<EOS>
me
the
deed
,
good
Lupo
<EOS>
,
"
said
Sir
Giles
,
taking
it
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
first
executed
by
me
—
there!—and
now
your
signature
,
Sir
Francis
,
"
he
added
,
passing
the
instrument
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
Now
thou
shalt
witness
it
,
Lupo
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
well!—'tis
well
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
snatching
it
back
again
,
as
soon
as
the
scrivener
had
finished
the
attestation
.
<EOS>
"
All
is
done
in
due
form
.
<EOS>
This
deed
makes
you
Lord
of
Mounchensey
,
Lanyere
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
handed
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
this
makes
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
ruler
of
the
destiny
of
Aveline
Calveley
,
"
rejoined
Lanyere
,
giving
a
paper
to
the
old
usurer
.
<EOS>
"This
chest
and
its
contents
are
yours
also
,
Lanyere
,
"
<EOS>
pursued
Sir
Giles
,
putting
in
the
deeds
,
and
locking
it
.
<EOS>
"
Will
it
please
you
to
take
the
key
.
<EOS>
From
this
moment
we
cease
to
be
master
and
servant
,
and
become
equals
and
friends!""Equals
,
it
may
be
,
Sir
Giles
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Lanyere
,
drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
height
,
and
speaking
with
great
haughtiness
;
"
but
never
friends
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
what
are
we
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
extortioner
,
fiercely
.
"
<EOS>
Am
I
mistaken
in
you
?
<EOS>
Take
heed
.
<EOS>
You
are
yet
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
so
,
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
apprehend
from
you
now
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Lanyere
;
"
but
you
have
much
to
fear
from
me
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
and
placing
the
parchment
within
his
doublet
,
he
hastily
quitted
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
"Perdition
!
<EOS>
have
I
been
outwitted
?
"
cried
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
shall
not
escape
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
rushing
after
him
,
he
called
from
the
head
of
the
great
staircase—"What
,
ho
!
<EOS>
Captain
Bludder!—and
ye
,
Tom
Wootton
and
Cutting
Dick
—
let
not
Lanyere
go
forth
.
<EOS>
Stay
him
and
take
from
him
the
deed
which
he
hath
placed
in
his
doublet
.
<EOS>
Cut
him
down
,
or
stab
him
if
he
resists
.
<EOS>
"But
,
though
efforts
were
made
to
obey
Sir
Giles
's
commands
,
the
promoter
effected
his
retreat
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XVI.Sir
Jocelyn
's
Rupture
with
de
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
Far
and
wide
echoed
the
report
of
Sir
Jocelyn
's
brilliant
achievements
at
the
jousts
;
and
wherever
he
went
,
he
was
hailed
as
vanquisher
of
the
hitherto
-
unconquered
Buckingham
.
<EOS>
He
bore
his
honours
meekly
,
yet
he
did
not
escape
calumny
;
for
at
a
court
,
as
everywhere
else
,
distinguished
success
is
certain
to
awaken
a
spirit
of
envy
and
detraction
.
<EOS>
These
paltry
feelings
,
however
,
were
entirely
confined
to
the
disappointed
of
his
own
sex
.
<EOS>
By
fairer
and
more
impartial
judges
,
who
had
witnessed
his
exploits
,
he
was
spoken
of
in
terms
of
unmingled
admiration
;
and
at
the
grand
revel
at
Whitehall
that
followed
the
jousts
,
many
a
soft
glance
told
him
how
tenderly
the
gentle
heart
,
whose
feelings
it
betrayed
,
was
inclined
towards
him
.
<EOS>
Faithful
,
loyal
,
and
chivalrous
,
our
young
knight
was
as
much
proof
against
these
lures
,
as
against
the
ruder
attacks
of
his
armed
opponents
in
the
lists
;
and
his
constancy
to
the
lady
of
his
love
remained
entirely
unshaken
.
<EOS>
Far
rather
would
he
have
been
with
Aveline
,
in
her
humble
dwelling
,
than
in
those
superb
festal
halls
,
surrounded
by
all
that
was
noble
and
beautiful
—
all
that
was
dangerous
and
delusive
.
<EOS>
Far
rather
would
he
have
received
one
smile
from
her
,
one
kindly
look
,
than
all
the
blandishments
showered
upon
him
by
these
enchantresses
.
<EOS>
Fain
would
he
have
avoided
the
banquet
—
but
as
the
hero
of
the
day
,
he
was
compelled
to
attend
it
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
had
to
enact
a
principal
part
at
the
revel
;
and
so
well
did
he
play
it
that
compliments
were
lavished
upon
him
,
enough
to
have
turned
an
ordinary
head
.
<EOS>
Not
from
any
desire
for
ostentatious
display
,
but
because
Prince
Charles
had
signified
to
him
his
wishes
on
the
subject
,
he
was
arrayed
in
all
the
pearls
and
ornaments
he
had
won
from
Buckingham
;
and
more
than
one
subtle
courtier
,
anxious
to
stand
well
with
him
,
flatteringly
declared
that
they
became
him
infinitely
better
than
the
Marquis
.
<EOS>
Others
,
less
favourably
disposed
,
remarked
that
his
gem
-
bedecked
doublet
was
like
the
garment
of
Nessus
,
and
would
cause
its
wearer
's
destruction
;
and
if
they
could
have
read
Buckingham
's
secret
thoughts
,
when
he
beheld
his
rival
so
adorned
,
they
would
have
felt
that
the
observation
was
not
unwarranted
.
<EOS>
But
,
though
fully
determined
upon
revenge
,
Buckingham
allowed
neither
look
nor
word
to
betray
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
he
displayed
more
than
his
usual
affability
to
Mounchensey
,
laughed
at
his
own
ill
-
luck
,
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
had
been
rightly
served
;
adding
,
that
he
blamed
himself
for
including
him
in
his
party
,
and
was
glad
Sir
Jocelyn
had
handled
him
so
rudely
.
<EOS>
Though
our
young
knight
might
well
doubt
Buckingham
's
sincerity
;
he
replied
to
all
his
courtly
speeches
in
similar
terms
,
and
the
greatest
cordiality
appeared
to
subsist
between
them
.
<EOS>
Enchanted
with
this
show
of
friendship
,
the
King
endeavoured
to
promote
it
by
keeping
them
near
him
throughout
the
evening
,
leading
them
to
converse
together
,
and
fawning
upon
them
,
as
was
his
way
with
those
he
highly
favoured
.
<EOS>
All
this
could
not
fail
to
be
satisfactory
to
Mounchensey
;
but
he
was
far
more
pleased
with
the
notice
of
Prince
Charles
,
who
treated
him
with
marked
consideration
.
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
in
compliance
with
an
invitation
to
that
effect
he
had
received
at
the
revel
,
Sir
Jocelyn
repaired
to
Ely
House
,
in
Holborn
,
the
residence
of
the
Spanish
Ambassador
,
and
was
at
once
admitted
to
his
presence
.
<EOS>
They
were
alone
,
and
after
a
few
preliminary
observations
upon
the
events
of
the
previous
day
,
De
Gondomar
remarked—"I
think
I
have
already
afforded
you
abundant
proof
of
my
friendly
feeling
towards
you
,
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
stop
with
what
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
My
power
of
serving
you
is
greater
than
you
may
imagine
it
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
can
lead
you
yet
higher
—
and
put
you
in
a
firmer
position
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
I
can
place
you
on
a
level
with
Buckingham,—perchance
above
him,—if
your
ambition
soars
so
high
.
<EOS>
"Mounchensey
<EOS>
endeavoured
to
express
his
deep
sense
of
gratitude
to
the
ambassador
,
and
regretted
his
small
means
of
requiting
the
numerous
and
important
favours
he
had
received
from
him
.
<EOS>
"I
will
tell
you
what
to
do
,
"
said
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
procure
me
certain
information
which
I
desire
to
obtain
.
<EOS>
By
my
instrumentality
you
have
,
in
some
degree
,
already
obtained
the
King
's
confidence
,
and
ere
long
are
sure
to
become
the
depositary
of
many
important
state
secrets
.
<EOS>
These
you
shall
communicate
to
me
.
<EOS>
And
you
must
also
use
your
best
endeavours
to
win
Prince
Charles
over
to
the
Church
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
this
proposal
seriously
made
to
me
,
Count
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Mounchensey
,
looking
at
him
with
astonishment
,
mingled
with
displeasure
.
<EOS>
"Unquestionably
<EOS>
it
is
serious
—
perfectly
serious
,
"
replied
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
only
to
serve
me
as
a
certain
young
nobleman
of
your
acquaintance
served
me
before
he
was
compelled
to
fly
from
England
to
avoid
the
consequences
of
a
quarrel
with
his
wife
's
family
.
<EOS>
Your
opportunities
will
be
greater
than
his
,
and
therefore
your
service
will
be
more
valuable
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
regret
that
such
disloyalty
should
be
laid
to
the
charge
of
any
English
noble
,
"
said
Sir
Jocelyn
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
think
not
,
because
Lord
Roos
played
the
spy
and
traitor
,
as
your
Excellency
insinuates
he
did
,
that
I
will
be
guilty
of
like
baseness
.
<EOS>
Up
to
this
moment
I
have
felt
nothing
but
gratitude
to
you
for
the
favours
you
have
heaped
upon
me
;
but
the
feeling
is
changed
to
resentment
when
I
understand
they
are
to
be
purchased
at
the
price
of
my
honour
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
accede
to
your
wishes
,
Count
.
<EOS>
You
must
seek
out
some
other
tool
.
<EOS>
I
can
be
none
in
your
hands
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
this
be
real
,
and
not
affected
indignation
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
"
said
De
Gondomar
coldly
,
"
it
would
seem
that
I
have
been
altogether
mistaken
in
you
,
and
that
I
have
been
helping
you
up
the
ladder
only
to
be
kicked
aside
when
you
have
gained
a
secure
footing
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
not
reached
the
last
step
yet
,
and
never
will
,
unless
I
find
you
more
reasonable
.
<EOS>
And
allow
me
to
ask
you
,
if
you
are
as
scrupulous
as
you
profess
to
be
,
how
you
came
to
bring
a
token
to
me
from
a
hired
spy
—
a
token
intended
to
let
me
know
you
were
willing
to
undertake
any
secret
service
I
might
choose
to
confide
to
you
?
<EOS>
Have
you
changed
your
mind
since
then
?
<EOS>
or
rather
,
do
you
not
fancy
yourself
out
of
danger
,
and
able
to
dispense
with
my
assistance?""I
<EOS>
have
ever
been
of
the
same
opinion
,
Count
;
have
ever
been
influenced
by
the
same
feelings
of
loyalty
and
devotion
to
my
sovereign
,
and
of
detestation
of
all
treasonable
practices
.
<EOS>
Had
I
been
aware
of
the
import
of
the
ring
<EOS>
I
showed
your
Excellency
on
our
first
meeting
,
I
would
have
hacked
off
my
finger
rather
than
have
displayed
it
.
<EOS>
Neither
did
I
know
the
character
of
the
man
who
confided
it
to
me
;
though
I
ought
to
have
distrusted
him
.
<EOS>
He
has
played
us
both
false
,
and
for
what
end
I
can
not
divine
.
<EOS>
""I
will
solve
the
riddle
for
you
,
Sir
:
he
thought
to
serve
you
,
"
said
De
Gondomar
;
"
and
he
has
done
so
,
and
most
effectually
,
though
you
are
now
unwilling
to
admit
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
good
reason
to
complain
of
him
—
you
have
none
.
<EOS>
""I
have
more
reason
for
complaint
than
your
Excellency
,
"
rejoined
Mounchensey
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
placed
me
in
a
most
painful
and
perplexing
position
.
<EOS>
""There
<EOS>
you
are
right
,
Sir
,
"
said
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
matter
how
arrived
at
,
you
are
in
a
position
from
which
you
can
not
extricate
yourself
with
honour
.
<EOS>
However
disinclined
you
may
be
to
act
in
concert
with
me
,
you
have
no
other
alternative
.
<EOS>
If
I
withdraw
my
support
from
you
,
your
fall
is
inevitable
.
<EOS>
Think
not
I
talk
lightly
.
<EOS>
You
are
surrounded
by
enemies
,
though
you
discern
them
not
.
<EOS>
Buckingham
's
magnanimous
conduct
at
the
revel
last
night
was
feigned
to
mask
his
purposes
towards
you
.
<EOS>
He
has
not
forgiven
his
defeat
,
and
means
to
avenge
it
.
<EOS>
You
fancy
yourself
on
the
high
road
to
preferment
;
but
you
are
on
the
verge
of
disgrace
and
ruin
.
<EOS>
I
alone
can
save
you
.
<EOS>
Choose
,
then
,
between
compliance
with
my
wishes
,
coupled
with
present
protection
and
future
advancement
,
and
the
consequences
certain
to
attend
your
refusal
.
<EOS>
Choose
,
I
say
,
between
my
friendship
and
my
enmity
.
<EOS>
""My
answer
shall
be
as
prompt
and
decisive
as
your
proposal
,
Count
,
"
replied
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"
I
at
once
reject
a
friendship
fettered
with
such
conditions
.
<EOS>
And
that
I
do
not
resent
the
affront
put
upon
me
in
your
dishonourable
proposal
,
must
be
set
down
to
the
obligations
you
have
imposed
upon
me
,
and
which
tie
up
my
hands
.
<EOS>
But
we
are
now
quits
;
and
if
any
further
indignity
be
offered
me
,
it
will
not
be
so
lightly
borne
.
<EOS>
""Perdone
,
vuestra
merced!—we
are
not
quits
,
"
cried
De
Gondomar
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
The
account
between
us
is
far
from
settled
;
nor
will
I
rest
content
till
you
have
paid
me
in
full
.
<EOS>
But
we
had
better
break
off
this
interview
,
"
he
added
,
more
calmly
,
"
since
no
good
is
like
to
result
from
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
useless
to
reason
with
you
;
but
you
are
wantonly
throwing
away
a
fairer
opportunity
than
falls
to
the
lot
of
most
men
,
and
will
see
your
folly
when
too
late
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
taking
my
leave
of
your
Excellency
,
as
there
are
no
terms
henceforth
to
be
observed
between
us
,
except
those
of
hostility
,
I
deem
it
right
to
state
,
that
though
I
shall
make
no
especial
reference
to
yourself
,
I
shall
hold
it
my
duty
to
acquaint
his
Majesty
with
the
system
of
espionage
introduced
into
the
palace
;
and
,
above
all
,
I
shall
take
care
to
guard
the
Prince
against
the
insidious
snares
laid
for
him
.
<EOS>
""It
is
a
pity
so
faithful
a
councillor
as
yourself
should
not
be
listened
to
,
"
rejoined
De
Gondomar
.
"
<EOS>
Yet
,
when
I
shut
the
doors
of
the
palace
against
you
—
as
I
will
do
—
you
will
find
it
difficult
to
obtain
a
hearing
either
from
Prince
or
King
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
all
your
efforts
to
the
contrary
,
I
shall
learn
any
state
secrets
I
desire
to
know
,
and
I
have
great
hopes
of
winning
over
Charles
Stuart
to
the
faith
for
which
his
lovely
and
martyred
ancestress
died
.
<EOS>
One
more
word
at
parting
,
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
You
will
remember
,
when
we
first
met
,
you
were
in
danger
from
the
Star
-
Chamber
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
useless
now
to
say
how
I
saved
you
from
the
punishment
your
rashness
had
incurred
—
how
,
while
aiding
you
with
the
King
,
I
kept
aloof
your
enemies
,
Mompesson
and
Mitchell
,
who
were
prepared
to
attach
your
person
for
contempt
of
that
terrible
court
,
and
would
have
done
so
,
if
I
had
not
prevented
them
.
<EOS>
The
warrant
for
your
arrest
still
exists
,
and
can
be
employed
at
any
moment
;
so
you
will
consider
how
long
you
can
count
upon
your
freedom
,
now
that
you
have
no
strong
arm
to
protect
you
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
have
my
own
arm
to
trust
to
,
"
rejoined
Sir
Jocelyn
,
resolutely
,
"
and
have
no
apprehensions
.
<EOS>
""Vaya
usted
con
dios
!
"
said
the
Spaniard
,
bowing
him
out
;
"
or
I
should
rather
say
,
"
he
added
to
himself
,
"
Vaya
mucho
en
<EOS>
mala
hora!"CHAPTER
XVII.Disgrace
.
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
was
not
without
great
uneasiness
at
the
result
of
his
interview
with
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
Had
it
been
possible
,
he
would
have
avoided
a
rupture
with
so
influential
a
personage
—
an
event
to
be
dreaded
at
any
time
,
but
especially
so
at
a
juncture
like
the
present
,
when
dangers
menaced
him
on
all
sides
,
and
the
only
question
appeared
to
be
,
from
what
side
the
first
blow
would
come
.
<EOS>
His
chief
anxiety
,
however
,
was
for
Aveline
,
whose
position
was
one
of
such
strange
and
imminent
peril
,
against
which
he
knew
not
how
to
guard
her
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
left
in
the
same
state
of
uncertainty
as
to
who
would
be
the
claimant
of
her
hand
;
for
the
mysterious
personage
in
the
mask
had
not
appeared
again
,
according
to
his
promise
,
after
the
jousts
.
<EOS>
This
suspense
was
terrible
,
and
Sir
Jocelyn
found
it
so
difficult
of
endurance
,
that
he
would
have
preferred
the
actual
presence
of
the
calamity
by
which
he
was
threatened
.
<EOS>
His
fears
were
,
that
the
claim
he
so
much
dreaded
would
be
made
by
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
in
person
,
and
in
that
case
he
had
determined
forcibly
to
resist
him
.
<EOS>
And
this
supposition
might
account
for
the
delay
—
since
he
knew
that
Sir
Giles
was
suffering
severely
from
the
effects
of
the
blow
he
had
dealt
him
in
the
tilt
-
yard
.
<EOS>
De
Gondomar
's
were
not
idle
threats
,
as
Sir
Jocelyn
soon
found
.
<EOS>
On
the
next
day
,
as
he
entered
the
palace
,
he
was
informed
by
the
Lord
Chamberlain
that
he
was
deprived
of
his
office
of
Gentleman
of
the
Bed
-
Chamber
;
and
when
he
demanded
the
reason
of
his
sudden
dismissal
,
the
Duke
of
Lennox
,
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
,
declared
he
was
unable
to
afford
him
any
information
.
<EOS>
But
what
the
Duke
refused
was
afforded
by
De
Gondomar
,
who
at
that
moment
entered
the
corridor
,
in
company
with
Buckingham
and
some
other
nobles
,
on
his
way
to
the
presence
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
his
late
protégé
,
the
ambassador
halted
for
a
moment
,
and
with
a
smile
of
triumph
<EOS>
said—"You
owe
your
dismissal
to
me
,
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
I
have
made
some
few
circumstances
concerning
you
that
had
just
come
to
my
ears
known
to
his
Majesty
;
and
as
he
does
not
choose
to
have
spies
about
his
person
,
he
has
released
you
from
all
further
attendance
upon
him
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
a
word
,
he
has
forbidden
your
attendance
again
at
the
palace
,
"
added
Buckingham
,
who
had
paused
likewise
,
with
an
insulting
laugh
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
must
to
the
King
,
your
Grace
,
"
cried
Sir
Jocelyn
to
the
Lord
Chamberlain
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
explain
the
falsehood
of
this
charge
to
his
Majesty
,
and
show
him
who
is
the
spy
and
traitor
he
has
to
fear
.
<EOS>
""You
can
not
pass
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
"
said
the
Duke
of
Lennox
,
placing
himself
in
his
way
,
while
two
halberdiers
advanced
to
bar
his
passage
with
their
partizans
.
<EOS>
"
I
say
not
a
word
as
to
the
cause
of
your
disgrace
;
but
I
may
tell
you
,
that
his
Majesty
is
greatly
offended
with
you
,
and
that
it
would
be
highly
imprudent
to
approach
him
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
,
even
were
it
permitted
you
to
do
so
—
which
it
is
not
.
<EOS>
As
I
have
said
,
you
are
deprived
of
your
office
,
and
enjoined
to
absent
yourself
from
the
palace
,
till
it
shall
be
his
Majesty
's
pleasure
to
recall
you
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
that
is
not
likely
to
be
soon
the
case
—
eh
,
Count
?
<EOS>
"
observed
Buckingham
,
with
a
laugh
.
"Not
<EOS>
very
likely
indeed
,
Marquis
,
"
said
the
ambassador
.
<EOS>
"
I
much
regret
that
I
have
been
the
means
of
introducing
so
unworthy
a
person
to
his
Majesty
;
but
I
have
made
all
the
amends
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
""Must
<EOS>
I
tamely
endure
all
these
insults
and
calumnies
,
your
Grace
?
"
cried
Sir
Jocelyn
furiously
.
<EOS>
"If
you
will
be
guided
by
me
,
you
will
retire
,
"
rejoined
the
Duke
of
Lennox
;
"
or
the
provocation
you
will
receive
may
induce
you
to
do
some
desperate
act
which
may
render
your
position
worse
,
and
put
your
restoration
to
the
King
's
favour
entirely
out
of
the
question
.
"While
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
was
debating
whether
he
should
comply
with
the
Duke
's
advice
,
the
door
of
the
presence
-
chamber
was
thrown
open
;
and
James
,
coming
forth
from
it
,
marched
slowly
along
the
corridor
.
<EOS>
Our
young
knight
now
fondly
hoped
that
the
King
might
deign
to
look
upon
him
,
and
so
enable
him
to
plead
his
cause
;
and
perhaps
the
Lord
Chamberlain
himself
entertained
similar
expectations
,
for
he
did
not
insist
upon
Sir
Jocelyn
's
withdrawal
,
but
allowed
him
to
remain
within
the
corridor
,
though
he
was
kept
aloof
by
the
halberdiers
.
<EOS>
But
both
were
disappointed
.
<EOS>
James
,
no
doubt
,
designedly
,
bestowed
his
most
gracious
marks
of
condescension
on
Buckingham
and
De
Gondomar
,
and
lingered
for
a
few
minutes
to
laugh
and
talk
with
them
.
<EOS>
After
this
,
as
he
was
passing
Sir
Jocelyn
,
he
pretended
to
notice
him
for
the
first
time
,
and
observed
,
in
a
tone
of
reproof
to
the
Lord
Chamberlain
,
"
What
doth
the
spy
here
,
my
Lord
Duke
?
<EOS>
I
thought
you
had
our
orders
concerning
him
.
<EOS>
See
they
are
better
obeyed
in
future
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
when
the
young
knight
would
have
spoken
,
he
interrupted
him
by
an
imperious
gesture
,
crying
out
,
"
Not
a
word
,
Sir!—not
a
word
!
<EOS>
We
will
hear
naught
mair
frae
ye
.
<EOS>
We
hae
heard
ower
meikle
already
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
passed
on
.
<EOS>
Thus
was
Mounchensey
's
disgrace
accomplished
by
his
enemies
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
XVIII.How
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
's
cause
was
espoused
by
the
'
prentices
.
<EOS>
Stung
almost
to
madness
by
the
sense
of
intolerable
wrong
,
our
young
knight
quitted
Whitehall
,
never
,
as
he
imagined
at
the
moment
,
to
enter
the
palace
again
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
was
not
humiliated
by
his
disgrace
,
because
he
felt
it
to
be
wholly
unmerited
.
<EOS>
His
enemies
had
triumphed
over
him
;
but
he
would
not
have
heeded
the
defeat
,
provided
he
could
efface
the
foul
stigma
cast
upon
his
reputation
,
and
rebut
the
false
charge
brought
against
him
by
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
With
a
heart
overflowing
with
rage
and
bitterness
,
and
with
a
thousand
wild
projects
passing
through
his
brain
,
Sir
Jocelyn
took
a
boat
at
Whitehall
stairs
,
and
ordered
the
watermen
to
row
down
the
river
,
without
assigning
any
paticular
place
of
landing
.
<EOS>
After
awhile
,
he
succeeded
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
in
controlling
his
angry
emotions
;
and
as
the
watermen
rested
on
their
oars
for
a
moment
,
to
inquire
his
destination
,
he
looked
round
,
and
perceiving
he
was
just
opposite
the
Three
Cranes
in
the
Vintry
,
he
desired
to
be
put
ashore
there
.
<EOS>
No
better
retreat
wherein
to
recover
his
composure
seemed
to
offer
itself
than
Madame
Bonaventure
's
comfortable
house
of
entertainment
;
and
thither
,
therefore
,
he
proceeded
,
and
at
his
request
was
shown
into
a
private
room
overlooking
the
river
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
was
he
installed
within
it
,
than
the
buxom
hostess
,
who
had
caught
sight
of
him
as
he
mounted
the
stairs
,
entered
,
and
<EOS>
in
her
blandest
accents
,
and
with
her
most
bewitching
smiles
,
begged
to
know
his
commands
;
declaring
that
all
that
her
house
possessed
was
at
his
service
.
<EOS>
She
was
running
on
thus
,
but
perceiving
the
young
knight
to
be
much
disturbed
,
she
instantly
changed
her
tone
,
and
expressed
such
genuine
concern
for
him
,
that
he
could
not
fail
to
be
moved
by
it
.
<EOS>
Without
making
her
an
entire
confidante
,
Sir
Jocelyn
told
her
enough
of
what
had
occurred
to
make
her
comprehend
his
position
;
and
highly
indignant
she
was
at
the
treatment
he
had
experienced
.
<EOS>
She
did
her
best
to
console
him
;
and
so
far
succeeded
,
that
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
partake
of
some
delicacies
which
she
caused
Cyprien
to
set
before
him
,
together
with
a
flask
of
the
best
vintage
in
her
cellar
;
and
the
discussion
of
these
good
things
,
coupled
with
the
hostess
's
assiduities
,
certainly
operated
as
a
balm
upon
his
wounded
feelings
.
<EOS>
The
repast
over
,
the
good
-
natured
dame
thought
it
best
to
leave
him
to
himself
;
and
drawing
his
chair
to
the
open
window
,
he
began
to
ruminate
upon
the
many
strange
events
that
had
happened
to
him
since
he
first
beheld
that
fair
prospect
almost
from
the
same
place
;
and
he
was
indulging
in
this
retrospect
,
when
his
own
name
,
pronounced
in
tones
familiar
to
him
,
caught
his
ear
,
and
looking
forth
,
he
perceived
Dick
Taverner
,
seated
on
a
bench
in
front
of
the
house
,
drinking
in
company
with
some
half
dozen
other
apprentices
,
his
boon
companions
.
<EOS>
The
conversation
of
these
roysterers
was
held
in
so
loud
a
key
that
it
could
not
fail
to
reach
his
ears
;
and
he
soon
ascertained
that
his
own
dismissal
from
court
was
the
theme
of
their
discourse
,
and
that
they
rightly
attributed
it
—
doubtless
owing
to
information
derived
from
their
hostess
—
to
the
instrumentality
of
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
It
was
evidently
Dick
Taverner
's
design
to
rouse
the
indignation
of
his
companions
;
and
he
had
little
difficulty
in
accomplishing
his
purpose
,
as
they
were
all
composed
of
very
inflammable
material
,
and
prone
to
take
fire
on
the
slightest
application
of
the
match
.
<EOS>
Dick
denounced
the
plotting
and
perfidious
Spaniard
as
a
traitor
to
the
King
and
a
subverter
of
the
Protestant
faith
;
and
counselled
vengeance
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Finding
Dick
's
suggestions
eagerly
caught
up
by
his
companions
,
and
that
the
number
of
his
listeners
was
momently
increasing
,
while
all
were
becoming
excited
by
what
the
orator
uttered
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
apprehensive
that
mischief
might
ensue
,
thought
it
right
to
interfere
,
and
accordingly
,
leaning
forward
from
the
casement
,
he
made
himself
known
to
the
group
below
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
him
,
and
learning
who
he
was
,
the
'
prentices
began
to
shout
and
declaim
vehemently
against
the
Spanish
ambassador
;
and
instigated
by
Dick
Taverner
,
who
refused
to
listen
either
to
the
entreaties
or
commands
of
the
young
knight
,
the
whole
party
seized
their
cudgels
,
and
dispersing
themselves
in
different
directions
,
vociferated
as
they
went—"Clubs
!
<EOS>
clubs!"It
was
now
as
vain
to
arrest
them
as
it
would
have
been
to
stop
the
course
of
a
conflagration
;
and
Sir
Jocelyn
was
deploring
the
damage
which
must
necessarily
be
done
to
his
cause
by
these
injudicious
friends
,
when
Dick
Taverner
,
with
a
look
of
exultation
,
and
brandishing
his
cudgel
,
burst
into
the
room
,
crying—"We
have
heard
all
from
Madame
Bonaventure
.
<EOS>
We
have
heard
of
De
Gondomar
's
perfidy
,
and
his
Majesty
's
injustice
.
<EOS>
We
will
set
you
right
.
<EOS>
The
bold
London
'
prentices
have
taken
your
cause
in
hand
,
and
will
avenge
you
.
<EOS>
They
will
hang
the
treacherous
Spaniard
,
and
burn
his
house
.
<EOS>
""Hark
<EOS>
ye
,
my
good
friend
,
Dick
Taverner
<EOS>
,
"
said
Sir
Jocelyn
,
"
this
must
not
be
.
<EOS>
Because
I
have
been
unjustly
treated
,
and
may
perchance
find
it
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
to
obtain
redress
,
it
does
not
follow
that
you
and
your
fellow
'
prentices
are
to
violate
the
law
.
<EOS>
These
riotous
proceedings
will
prejudice
my
cause
rather
than
aid
it
;
and
if
you
have
any
regard
for
me
you
will
use
your
influence
with
your
comrades
to
check
them
ere
mischief
ensue
.
""Impossible
!
"
exclaimed
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
The
matter
has
gone
too
far
to
be
stopped
now
.
<EOS>
You
might
as
well
attempt
to
turn
back
a
mill
-
dam
that
has
burst
its
bounds
,
as
the
headstrong
London
'
prentices
when
they
have
taken
up
their
cudgels
.
<EOS>
Go
through
with
the
business
they
will
.
<EOS>
This
is
not
the
only
quarrel
we
have
with
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
We
hate
him
for
his
insolence
and
arrogance
,
which
have
been
often
displayed
towards
us
;
We
hate
him
because
he
is
the
sworn
enemy
of
our
religion
,
and
would
subvert
it
if
he
could
.
<EOS>
As
regards
myself
,
I
have
my
own
particular
reasons
for
hating
him
.
<EOS>
Do
not
you
meddle
with
the
affair
,
but
leave
its
arrangement
to
us
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
I
must
interfere
,
"
cried
Sir
Jocelyn
;
"
if
you
act
thus
,
in
spite
of
all
my
remonstrances
.
<EOS>
I
must
regard
you
in
the
light
of
enemies
rather
than
friends
,
and
shall
lend
my
help
to
quell
the
disturbance
you
will
occasion
.
<EOS>
Be
ruled
by
me
,
good
Dickon
,
and
desist
from
it
.
<EOS>
Call
in
your
comrades
,
who
are
raging
about
like
savage
dogs
broken
loose
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
they
be
dogs
,
"
rejoined
Dick
,
with
a
laugh
,
"
the
Spanish
ambassador
is
likely
enough
to
become
acquainted
with
their
teeth
.
<EOS>
But
I
might
whistle
loudly
enough
to
them
before
the
staunch
hounds
would
come
back
to
me
;
and
,
in
good
sooth
,
I
have
no
inclination
to
obey
your
commands
in
his
instance
,
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
and
fearing
he
might
be
detained
altogether
if
he
waited
longer
,
he
darted
out
of
the
room
,
and
presently
afterwards
was
heard
shouting
along
the
wharf
with
the
loudest
of
his
riotous
companions—"No
Papists
!
<EOS>
No
Spanish
spies
!
<EOS>
Clubs!—clubs!"Sir
Jocelyn
saw
that
a
storm
was
roused
which
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
allay
;
but
an
effort
must
be
made
to
do
so
,
even
if
he
were
compelled
to
act
against
his
friends
;
and
he
was
about
to
follow
the
apprentice
into
the
street
,
when
he
was
prevented
by
the
sudden
entrance
of
a
tall
personage
,
wrapped
in
a
black
cloak
,
and
masked
,
whom
he
at
once
recognised
as
the
individual
who
had
given
him
the
token
to
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
"I
am
glad
to
have
found
you
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
"
said
this
personage
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
on
the
look
-
out
for
you
to
give
you
a
warning
.
<EOS>
Avoid
any
place
you
have
been
in
the
habit
of
frequenting
;
and
,
above
all
,
go
not
near
Aveline
's
dwelling
.
<EOS>
The
officers
of
the
Star
-
Chamber
are
on
the
watch
for
you
;
and
if
found
,
your
arrest
is
certain
.
<EOS>
""I
can
place
little
reliance
on
aught
<EOS>
you
tell
me
,
Sir
,
"
rejoined
Sir
Jocelyn
,
"
after
the
trick
you
played
me
in
causing
me
to
deliver
that
ring
to
the
Conde
de
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
Nothing
you
can
say
shall
hinder
me
from
going
forth
as
I
am
accustomed
to
do
;
and
it
is
my
purpose
to
proceed
ere
long
to
the
dwelling
you
specially
caution
me
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
""You
will
repent
your
rashness
,
young
Sir
,
"
said
the
other
;
"
but
I
pray
you
not
to
go
forth
till
you
have
heard
certain
disclosures
which
I
have
to
make
to
you
,
and
which
I
am
well
assured
will
induce
you
to
alter
your
opinion
of
me
.
<EOS>
""I
can
put
no
faith
in
the
statements
of
a
hireling
,
base
enough
to
play
the
spy
for
an
enemy
of
his
country
,
"
rejoined
Sir
Jocelyn
,
scornfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Stand
aside
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
Your
employer
,
De
Gondomar
,
is
in
danger
from
these
hot
-
headed
apprentices
;
and
if
you
owe
him
any
gratitude
for
past
favours
,
you
may
find
occasion
for
its
display
now
.
<EOS>
""What
!
<EOS>
are
you
about
to
take
part
with
your
enemy
and
against
your
friends
?
<EOS>
These
apprentices
are
about
to
redress
your
wrongs
—
in
a
lawless
manner
it
is
true
—
but
the
circumstances
justify
their
conduct
.
<EOS>
""No
circumstances
can
justify
outrage
,
and
violation
of
the
law
,
"
said
Sir
Jocelyn
;
"
and
if
injury
be
attempted
against
De
Gondomar
,
I
must
defend
him
.
<EOS>
""This
is
mere
madness
,
"
cried
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Stay
and
hear
what
I
have
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
imports
you
much
to
know
it
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
now
,
"
replied
Sir
Jocelyn
,
pushing
past
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
On
some
other
occasion
.
<EOS>
""You
are
throwing
life
and
liberty
away
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
and
to
no
purpose
,
"
cried
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
He
heeds
me
not
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
tone
of
deep
disappointment
.
<EOS>
"
Imprudent
that
he
is
!
<EOS>
he
will
thwart
all
the
plans
I
have
formed
for
his
benefit
,
and
at
the
very
moment
they
have
arrived
at
maturity
.
<EOS>
I
must
follow
and
protect
him
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
too
rushed
down
the
stairs
,
and
made
all
the
haste
he
could
across
the
Vintry
wharf
after
Sir
Jocelyn
,
who
was
hurrying
up
a
narrow
thoroughfare
communicating
with
Thames
Street
.
<EOS>
Here
a
numerous
body
of
'
prentices
were
already
collected
,
holding
a
consultation
as
to
their
plan
of
attack
.
<EOS>
After
listening
to
a
brief
but
stirring
harangue
from
Dick
Taverner
,
who
got
upon
a
horse
-
block
for
the
purpose
of
addressing
them
,
and
recommended
them
to
proceed
to
Ely
House
,
in
Holborn
,
the
residence
of
the
offending
Ambassador
,
and
there
await
his
return
from
Whitehall
;
they
approved
of
his
proposal
,
and
unanimously
electing
Dick
as
their
leader
,
set
forth
on
their
expedition
,
gathering
strength
as
they
went
along
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
they
reached
Blackfriars
they
numbered
many
hundreds
.
<EOS>
Little
or
no
interruption
was
offered
them
on
their
route
;
and
the
slight
hindrance
they
encountered
from
a
detachment
of
the
city
-
watch
was
speedily
overborne
.
<EOS>
Skirting
Bridewell
,
they
traversed
Shoe
Lane
,
and
ascending
Holborn
Hill
,
found
themselves
in
the
vicinity
of
Ely
House
,
where
they
came
to
a
halt
,
and
arranged
their
forces
.

CHAPTER
XIX.A
Noble
Revenge
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
pleasanter
than
the
situation
of
the
Spanish
ambassador
's
residence
,
surrounded
as
it
was
by
noble
gardens
;
but
its
beauties
seemed
now
likely
to
be
devastated
by
the
blind
fury
of
the
apprentices
.
<EOS>
Much
mischief
would
indeed
have
been
done
in
a
very
short
time
if
it
had
not
been
for
their
leader
.
<EOS>
He
authoritatively
commanded
them
to
refrain
from
the
work
of
demolition
till
they
had
settled
accounts
with
the
ambassador
himself
,
who
might
be
expected
each
moment
,
as
they
had
ascertained
that
he
was
on
his
way
home
from
the
palace
.
<EOS>
The
information
they
had
received
proved
to
be
correct
;
and
ere
many
minutes
elapsed
,
a
magnificent
litter
,
borne
by
eight
stout
varlets
,
and
attended
by
several
gentlemen
and
pages
,
in
the
well
-
known
liveries
of
De
Gondomar
,
was
seen
to
pass
through
Holborn
Bars
and
advance
towards
them
.
<EOS>
Very
soon
,
however
,
the
bearers
of
the
litter
halted
,
surprised
and
alarmed
at
the
sight
of
the
crowd
investing
Ely
House
;
but
De
Gondomar
,
who
had
no
apprehension
,
commanded
them
to
proceed
,
and
they
reluctantly
obeyed
.
<EOS>
The
'
prentices
allowed
the
litter
to
come
on
till
they
could
surround
it
,
when
they
set
up
a
loud
shout
,
making
it
evident
that
mischief
was
intended
.
<EOS>
On
this
the
gentlemen
and
pages
in
attendance
upon
the
ambassador
drew
their
swords
and
put
themselves
into
a
posture
of
defence
,
endeavouring
to
keep
off
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
But
their
resistance
was
of
little
avail
.
<EOS>
The
'
prentices
'
clubs
quickly
shivered
their
weapons
,
and
drove
them
back
.
<EOS>
When
he
became
aware
of
the
jeopardy
in
which
he
stood
,
De
Gondomar
,
anxious
to
gain
time
,
in
the
hope
that
assistance
might
arrive
,
demanded
of
the
leader
of
the
furious
-
looking
crew
who
had
drawn
aside
the
curtains
of
his
litter
,
and
ordered
him
in
insolent
tones
to
come
forth
,
why
they
molested
him
.
<EOS>
The
individual
appealed
to
replied
that
,
having
heard
of
his
infamous
usage
of
Sir
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
,
and
of
the
false
accusation
he
had
brought
against
him
to
the
King
,
they
were
determined
to
inflict
upon
his
Excellency
the
punishment
due
to
public
and
notorious
slanderers
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
by
what
right
do
you
constitute
yourselves
my
judges
?
"
cried
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
"
Take
heed
what
you
do
—
you
may
bring
yourselves
within
reach
of
a
halter
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
hear
what
he
says
,
brother
'
prentices
?
"
cried
Dick
Taverner
.
"
<EOS>
He
threatens
to
hang
us
,
and
no
doubt
if
he
could
carry
out
his
schemes
,
and
bring
back
the
Pope
's
authority
,
he
would
burn
us
in
Smithfield
,
as
they
did
the
holy
martyrs
in
Mary
's
days
.
<EOS>
He
has
charged
a
true
and
loyal
subject
of
his
Majesty
with
being
a
spy
.
<EOS>
In
return
we
tell
himhe
is
the
worst
of
spies
—
a
spy
employed
by
the
Pope
;
and
we
will
teach
him
the
danger
of
his
employment
.
<EOS>
""Hands
<EOS>
off
,
base
varlets
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
De
Gondomar
,
endeavouring
to
shake
himself
free
from
the
rude
grasp
imposed
upon
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
spite
of
his
resistance
,
he
was
dragged
from
the
litter
,
while
a
shower
of
blows
from
the
'
prentices
cudgels
fell
upon
his
shoulders
;
and
it
is
probable
he
would
have
experienced
much
severer
treatment
,
if
indeed
he
had
escaped
with
life
,
if
at
this
moment
Sir
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
,
sword
in
hand
and
followed
by
Clement
Lanyere
,
had
not
burst
through
the
throng
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
<EOS>
as
I
suspected
,
"
cried
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
"
You
,
Mounchensey
,
are
the
author
and
instigator
of
this
outrage
,
and
are
come
to
see
that
your
tools
do
their
work
properly
.
<EOS>
""It
is
false
,
"
cried
Dick
Taverner
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
Excellency
judges
of
others
by
yourself
.
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
would
have
checked
us
if
he
could
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
be
expected
to
believe
such
an
assertion
as
this
,
"
cried
De
Gondomar
incredulously
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
my
actions
speak
for
me
,
"
cried
Mounchensey
.
<EOS>
"
Friends
,
"
he
called
out
,
"
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
I
have
good
ground
of
complaint
against
the
Conde
de
Gondomar
—
that
he
has
deeply
injured
me
—
and
that
I
will
compel
him
to
make
me
reparation
in
due
season
—
but
I
can
not
permit
outrage
to
be
offered
him
;
and
if
aught
further
be
attempted
,
my
arm
will
be
raised
in
his
defence
.
<EOS>
""How
!
<EOS>
can
this
be
possible
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
De
Gondomar
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
we
are
fighting
Sir
Jocelyn
's
battles
,
and
he
turns
round
upon
us
!
"
<EOS>
cried
a
burly
'
prentice
,
while
loud
murmurs
arose
from
the
others
,
and
the
cudgels
were
again
brandished
menacingly
.
<EOS>
"Leave
<EOS>
him
to
us
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
"
said
Dick
Taverner
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
he
had
better
not
interfere
,
of
he
will
come
in
for
his
share
of
the
blows
,
"
<EOS>
roared
several
voices
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
care
<EOS>
not
what
befals
me
,
"
shouted
Mounchensey
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
injure
a
hair
of
his
Excellency
's
head
while
I
stand
by
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
as
he
spoke
he
warded
off
several
blows
aimed
at
the
ambassador
.
<EOS>
"I
am
with
you
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
"
said
Clement
Lanyere
,
clearing
a
space
around
them
with
his
long
rapier
,
but
avoiding
,
so
far
as
possible
,
doing
injury
to
the
'
prentices
.
<EOS>
At
this
critical
juncture
,
and
when
it
seemed
likely
that
,
owing
to
his
chivalrous
interference
,
Sir
Jocelyn
would
share
the
ambassador
's
fate
,
he
being
fairly
resolved
,
as
he
showed
,
to
defend
him
with
his
life
,
a
cry
was
raised
that
a
body
of
the
royal
guards
were
approaching
;
and
as
the
trampling
of
horse
,
accompanied
by
the
clatter
of
swords
,
left
no
doubt
of
the
fact
,
and
as
,
moreover
,
the
bold
'
prentices
felt
no
disposition
to
encounter
regular
soldiery
,
they
instantly
abandoned
their
prey
and
took
to
their
beels
,
the
chief
part
of
them
leaping
the
hedge
which
then
grew
along
the
north
side
of
Holborn
,
and
scouring
off
through
the
fields
in
every
direction
.
<EOS>
Some
half
dozen
were
made
prisoners
by
the
guard
;
and
amongst
these
,
we
regret
to
state
,
was
the
leader
of
the
riotous
assembly
,
Dick
Taverner
.
<EOS>
"Thou
art
likely
to
make
acquaintance
with
the
pillory
and
the
cart
's
tail
,
if
not
with
the
hangman
,
friend
,
"
said
the
soldier
who
secured
him
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
I
begin
to
fear
,
"
replied
Dick
.
"
<EOS>
Alack
!
<EOS>
and
well
-
a
-
day
!
<EOS>
what
will
become
of
Gillian!""An
that
be
thy
mistress
's
name
,
friend
<EOS>
,
you
should
have
thought
of
her
before
you
engaged
in
this
disturbance
.
<EOS>
You
are
likely
now
to
part
company
with
her
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"While
<EOS>
Dick
lamented
the
predicament
in
which
he
had
placed
himself
,
the
Conde
de
Gondomar
,
freed
from
all
apprehension
,
turned
towards
his
deliverer
,
and
proffering
him
his
hand
,
said—"You
have
nobly
revenged
yourself
,
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
I
trust
we
may
be
friends
once
more
.
<EOS>
I
will
make
you
ample
reparation
for
the
wrong
I
have
done
you
.
"But
<EOS>
the
young
knight
,
folding
his
arms
upon
his
breast
,
sternly
replied—"When
reparation
is
made
,
Count
,
I
may
accept
your
hand
,
but
not
till
then
.
<EOS>
""At
least
enter
my
house
,
"
urged
the
ambassador
,
"
where
you
will
be
protected
from
arrest
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
hesitate
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
"
subjoined
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
in
great
peril
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
the
young
knight
haughtily
refused
.
<EOS>
"I
will
not
owe
an
asylum
to
you
,
Count
,
"
he
said
,
"
till
my
name
be
cleared
from
reproach
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
with
a
proud
salutation
,
he
departed
.
<EOS>
The
Spanish
ambassador
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
looked
after
him
with
mingled
admiration
and
contempt
.
<EOS>
He
then
turned
to
the
promoter
,
and
said
,
"
Come
in
with
me
,
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
I
have
somewhat
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
""I
must
pray
your
Excellency
to
excuse
me
just
now
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
business
on
hand
.
<EOS>
"And
bowing
with
nearly
as
much
haughtiness
as
Sir
Jocelyn
,
he
followed
in
the
course
taken
by
the
young
knight
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XX.A
Place
of
Refuge
.
<EOS>
After
quitting
De
Gondomar
,
as
before
related
,
Sir
Jocelyn
hurried
along
Holborn
with
the
intention
of
proceeding
to
Aveline
's
cottage
,
which
was
at
no
great
distance
from
Ely
House
,
though
in
a
secluded
situation
,
withdrawn
from
the
road
;
and
he
was
just
about
to
strike
into
the
narrow
lane
leading
to
it
,
when
he
was
arrested
by
the
voice
of
Clement
Lanyere
,
who
had
followed
him
,
unobserved
.
<EOS>
"Stay
<EOS>
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
I
beg
of
you
,
"
cried
the
promoter
,
coming
quickly
up
to
him
;
"
you
are
rushing
on
certain
destruction
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
go
nigh
that
cottage
to
-
day
;
no
,
nor
for
several
days
to
come
.
<EOS>
Foes
are
lying
in
ambush
round
it
;
and
the
only
spectacle
you
will
afford
her
<EOS>
you
love
will
be
that
of
your
arrest
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
was
an
earnestness
in
the
speaker
's
manner
that
could
not
fail
to
carry
conviction
of
his
sincerity
to
the
breast
of
his
hearer
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
my
soul
,
I
speak
the
truth
,
"
said
Lanyere
,
perceiving
the
impression
he
had
made
,
"
as
you
will
find
if
you
go
many
steps
further
.
<EOS>
Place
yourself
in
my
hands
,
and
I
will
save
you
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
motive
can
you
have
for
acting
thus
?
"
demanded
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"
What
interest
do
you
take
in
me?""Do
not
question
me
now
:
you
shall
have
full
explanation
hereafter
.
<EOS>
Be
satisfied
I
am
a
friend,—perchance
your
best
friend
.
<EOS>
Come
with
me
,
and
I
will
take
you
to
a
place
of
safety
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
what
is
to
happen
to
Aveline
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
young
knight
,
in
deep
anxiety
.
<EOS>
"I
will
endeavour
to
watch
over
her
,
"
replied
the
promoter
;
"
and
I
trust
no
harm
will
befall
her
.
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
you
will
deprive
yourself
of
the
power
of
rendering
her
any
protection
,
if
you
are
rash
enough
to
go
forward
now
.
"Struck
<EOS>
by
the
force
of
these
remarks
,
our
young
knight
felt
he
had
no
alternative
but
to
submit
to
circumstances
,
and
he
accordingly
agreed
to
accept
the
aid
proffered
him
by
his
mysterious
friend
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
without
feelings
of
intense
anguish
that
he
turned
away
from
the
path
leading
to
the
little
secluded
cottage
containing
all
he
held
dear
,
and
followed
his
conductor
,
who
seemed
resolved
to
allow
him
no
time
for
further
hesitation
,
but
proceeding
at
a
rapid
pace
towards
the
west
till
he
reached
Broad
Saint
Giles's
—
then
a
rural
village
—
and
entered
a
small
tavern
,
bearing
the
sign
of
"
The
Rose
and
Crown
,
"
the
landlord
of
which
appeared
to
have
an
understanding
with
the
promoter
,
for
at
a
sign
from
him
,
he
immediately
ushered
his
guests
into
a
chamber
up
-
stairs
,
and
without
saying
a
word
,
left
them
alone
together
.
<EOS>
"Here
you
will
be
secure
and
undisturbed
,
"
said
Lanyere
;
"
and
all
your
wants
will
be
cared
for
by
my
trusty
ally
,
Barnabas
Boteler
;
but
,
for
your
own
sake
,
you
must
consent
to
remain
a
close
prisoner
,
till
I
bring
you
word
that
you
may
go
forth
with
safety
.
<EOS>
I
must
now
leave
you
,
having
much
to
do
,
and
must
defer
the
explanations
I
design
to
give
you
to
a
more
convenient
season
.
<EOS>
Be
not
uneasy
if
you
should
not
see
me
for
a
few
days
,
as
circumstances
may
prevent
my
coming
to
you
.
<EOS>
When
I
next
appear
,
I
trust
it
may
be
to
bring
you
good
tidings
.
<EOS>
Till
then
,
farewell
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
without
waiting
for
any
reply
from
Sir
Jocelyn
,
he
hastily
departed
.
<EOS>
Left
alone
,
our
young
knight
did
the
best
he
could
to
reconcile
himself
to
the
strange
situation
in
which
he
was
placed
.
<EOS>
He
was
naturally
full
of
anxiety
,
both
on
his
own
account
,
and
on
that
of
Aveline
;
yet
,
on
calm
reflection
,
he
felt
satisfied
he
had
acted
for
the
best
,
and
that
,
in
accepting
the
protection
of
the
mysterious
individual
who
seemed
bent
upon
directing
his
fortunes
,
he
had
followed
the
dictates
of
prudence
.
<EOS>
Barnabas
Boteler
attended
him
in
person
,
and
suffered
no
one
else
to
come
near
him
;
but
though
the
worthy
host
seemed
anxious
to
anticipate
his
wants
in
every
particular
,
his
manner
was
reserved
,
and
,
in
Sir
Jocelyn
's
opinion
,
he
had
something
of
the
look
of
a
jailor
,
and
this
notion
was
strengthened
when
he
found
himself
locked
in
his
room
.
<EOS>
Probably
this
was
only
done
as
a
precautionary
measure
by
the
host
;
and
as
the
window
was
at
no
great
height
from
the
ground
,
and
he
could
descend
from
it
when
he
chose
,
he
gave
himself
no
great
concern
about
the
matter
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
three
days
passed
by
without
anything
occurring
to
break
the
monotony
of
his
wearisome
confinement,—not
even
a
visit
from
Clement
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
To
Sir
Jocelyn
's
inquiries
concerning
him
,
the
host
professed
utter
inability
to
give
a
precise
answer
,
but
said
that
he
might
arrive
at
any
moment
.
<EOS>
As
he
did
not
appear
,
however
,
on
the
fourth
day
,
Sir
Jocelyn
's
patience
got
quite
worn
out
,
and
his
uneasiness
respecting
Aveline
having
become
insupportable
,
he
determined
,
at
all
hazards
,
on
visiting
her
cottage
.
<EOS>
Without
acquainting
the
host
with
his
intention
,
or
asking
to
have
the
door
unfastened
,
he
opened
the
window
which
looked
into
a
garden
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
and
sprang
from
it
.
<EOS>
His
furtive
departure
did
not
appear
to
be
noticed
,
and
he
soon
gained
the
road
,
and
took
the
direction
of
Aveline
's
dwelling
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXI.The
Arrest
.
<EOS>
As
he
approached
the
cottage
a
heavy
presentiment
of
ill
seized
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
The
place
seemed
to
have
lost
its
customary
smiling
air
.
<EOS>
No
fair
countenance
beamed
upon
him
from
the
casement
;
no
light
footsteps
were
heard
hastening
to
the
door
;
no
one
opened
it
to
give
him
welcome
.
<EOS>
Could
Aveline
have
fled'?—or
had
some
dire
misfortune
happened
to
her
.
<EOS>
Suspense
was
worse
than
certainty
of
ill
:
and
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
he
raised
the
latch
,
and
with
trembling
footsteps
crossed
the
threshold
.
<EOS>
She
was
gone
—
he
could
no
longer
doubt
it
.
<EOS>
The
disordered
appearance
of
the
chamber
in
which
he
found
himself
,
with
its
furniture
scattered
about
,
seemed
to
tell
of
a
struggle
,
and
a
forcible
abduction
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
though
expecting
no
answer
,
he
called
forth
her
name
in
accents
of
wildest
despair
.
<EOS>
She
came
not
to
his
cries
—
neither
she
nor
her
companion
,
Dame
Sherborne
,
nor
her
faithful
attendant
old
Anthony
Rocke
.
<EOS>
All
were
gone
.
<EOS>
The
house
was
indeed
desolate
.
<EOS>
Still
clinging
to
hope
,
he
flew
up
-
stairs
,
but
could
find
no
traces
there
of
any
of
the
inmates
of
the
dwelling
;
and
with
a
heart
now
completely
crushed
,
he
descended
to
the
chamber
he
had
just
quitted
.
<EOS>
Here
he
found
Clement
Lanyere
surveying
the
scene
of
confusion
around
him
with
a
stern
and
troubled
look
.
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
instantly
rushed
up
to
him
,
and
seizing
him
by
the
arm
,
fiercely
demanded
what
had
become
of
Aveline?"She
is
in
the
hands
of
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
,
"
replied
the
promoter
,
shaking
-
him
off
;
"
and
,
for
aught
I
know
,
may
be
wedded
to
him
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
""Wedded
!
<EOS>
"
almost
shrieked
the
young
man
.
"
<EOS>
Impossible
!
<EOS>
she
would
never
consent
—
and
he
would
not
dare
have
recourse
to
violence
.
<EOS>
""Though
<EOS>
he
might
not
,
his
partner
,
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
,
would
have
no
such
scruples
,
"
returned
the
promoter
.
<EOS>
"
But
perhaps
you
are
right
,
and
Aveline
's
determined
resistance
may
intimidate
them
both
so
that
they
may
abandon
their
design
.
<EOS>
I
hope
so
for
your
sake
,
and
for
hers
also
—
<EOS>
but
I
have
my
fears
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
know
more
than
you
choose
to
avow
,
Sir
,
"
said
Sir
Jocelyn
sternly,—"and
<EOS>
as
you
value
your
life
,
I
command
you
to
speak
plainly
,
and
tell
me
what
has
happened
,
and
where
I
shall
find
Aveline
.
<EOS>
""So
commanded
by
any
other
than
yourself
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
"
rejoined
the
promoter
,
"
I
would
not
speak
;
but
to
you
I
say
,
as
I
have
before
declared
,
that
Aveline
is
undoubtedly
in
the
power
of
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
,
and
that
it
will
rest
entirely
with
herself
whether
she
escapes
him
or
not
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
you
have
caused
me
to
be
detained
while
she
has
been
carried
off
,
"
exclaimed
Sir
Jocelyn
,
furiously
.
<EOS>
"
Fool
that
I
was
to
trust
you
!
<EOS>
You
are
in
league
with
the
villains
.
<EOS>
""Think
<EOS>
of
me
<EOS>
what
you
please
,
and
say
what
you
will
—
you
shall
not
anger
me
,
"
rejoined
the
promoter
.
<EOS>
"
I
discovered
your
flight
from
the
place
of
refuge
I
had
procured
for
you
,
and
guessing
where
you
had
come
,
followed
you
hither
.
<EOS>
Your
danger
is
not
past
.
<EOS>
Vainly
will
you
seek
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
find
him,—but
<EOS>
you
will
find
a
serjeant
-
at-
arms
with
a
Star
-
Chamber
warrant
for
your
arrest
.
<EOS>
To
this
you
can
offer
no
resistance
;
and
what
will
follow
?
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you:—immediate
incarceration
in
the
Fleet
Prison
.
<EOS>
And
when
safely
lodged
there
,
how
,
may
I
ask
,
are
you
to
liberate
Aveline?""I
must
trust
to
chance
,
"
replied
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
no
longer
place
any
reliance
upon
you
.
<EOS>
Stand
aside
,
and
let
me
pass
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
harm
you
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
can
not
injure
one
whose
intentions
are
friendly
to
you
as
mine
are
.
<EOS>
Listen
to
me
,
and
let
what
I
have
to
say
sink
deeply
into
your
breast
.
<EOS>
Do
anything
rather
than
render
yourself
amenable
to
the
accursed
tribunal
I
have
named
.
<EOS>
Abandon
mistress
,
friend
,
relative
—
all
who
are
near
and
dear
to
you
—
if
they
would
bring
you
within
its
grasp
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
do
you
venture
to
give
me
this
shameful
council
?
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
will
attend
to
it
?
"
cried
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"I
am
sure
you
will
,
if
you
hear
me
out
—
and
you
shall
hear
me
,
"
the
promoter
exclaimed
with
so
much
authority
that
the
young
man
,
however
impatient
,
could
not
refuse
attention
,
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
Look
me
in
the
face
,
Sir
Jocelyn
!
<EOS>
Regard
me
well
!
<EOS>
Behold
these
ineffaceable
marks
made
by
the
heated
iron
,
and
the
sharpened
knife
!
<EOS>
How
came
they
there
?
<EOS>
From
a
sentence
of
the
Star
-
Chamber
.
<EOS>
And
as
my
offence
was
the
same
as
yours
,
so
your
sentence
will
correspond
with
mine
.
<EOS>
Your
punishment
will
be
the
same
as
mine
—
branding
and
mutilation
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
I
perceive
I
have
touched
you
now
.
<EOS>
""What
was
your
offence
,
unhappy
man
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Sir
Jocelyn
,
averting
his
gaze
from
the
hideous
aspect
which
,
now
lighted
up
with
mingled
emotions
of
rage
and
despair
,
had
become
absolutely
appalling
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
same
as
your
own
,
as
I
have
said
,
"
replied
the
other;—"a
few
hasty
words
impugning
the
justice
of
this
vindictive
court
.
<EOS>
Better
had
I
have
cut
out
my
tongue
than
have
given
utterance
to
them
.
<EOS>
But
my
case
more
nearly
resembled
yours
than
I
have
yet
explained
,
for
,
like
you
,
I
had
incurred
the
displeasure
of
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
,
and
was
by
him
delivered
to
these
hellish
tormentors
.
<EOS>
Acting
under
cover
of
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
and
in
pursuance
of
its
iniquitous
decrees
,
he
nailed
me
to
the
pillory
,
and
so
fast
,
that
the
ears
through
which
the
spikes
were
driven
were
left
behind
.
<EOS>
Think
how
you
would
like
that
,
Sir
Jocelyn
?
<EOS>
Think
what
you
would
feel
,
if
you
stood
there
on
that
infamous
post
,
a
spectacle
to
the
base
and
shouting
rabble
,
with
a
paper
fastened
to
your
breast
,
setting
forth
your
crimes
,
and
acquainting
all
that
you
were
a
Star
-
Chamber
delinquent?""Enough
,
Sir
,
"
interrupted
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
enough
—
more
than
enough
,
"
rejoined
the
other
;
"
but
I
can
not
spare
you
the
whole
of
the
recital
,
however
painful
it
may
be
to
you
.
<EOS>
My
own
sufferings
will
be
yours
,
if
you
heed
not
.
<EOS>
So
I
shall
go
on
.
<EOS>
In
robbing
me
of
my
ears
,
the
executioner
had
only
half
done
his
work
.
<EOS>
He
had
still
further
to
deface
the
image
of
his
Maker,—and
he
hesitated
not
in
his
task
.
<EOS>
No
savage
in
the
wilds
could
have
treated
his
deadliest
enemy
worse
than
he
treated
me
;
and
yet
the
vile
concourse
applauded
him
,
and
not
a
word
of
pity
escaped
them
.
<EOS>
My
sentence
was
fully
carried
out
;
my
features
for
ever
disfigured
;
and
the
letters
of
shame
indelibly
stamped
upon
my
cheek
.
<EOS>
You
may
read
them
there
now
if
you
will
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
thrill
me
with
horror
,
"
said
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
mine
is
not
a
mirthful
history
,
though
that
fiend
in
human
form
,
Sir
Giles
,
hath
often
laughed
at
it
,
"
rejoined
the
promoter
.
<EOS>
"
It
might
make
you
shudder
,
and
perchance
move
you
to
tears
,
if
you
could
hear
it
all
;
but
for
the
present
,
I
shall
confine
myself
to
such
portions
of
it
as
bear
upon
your
own
perilous
position
—
and
I
therefore
hold
myself
out
as
a
lesson
to
you
.
<EOS>
Again
,
I
bid
you
look
upon
this
ravaged
countenance
,
and
say
,
if
by
any
stretch
of
fancy
you
can
persuade
yourself
it
was
once
as
comely
as
your
own
.
<EOS>
You
find
it
difficult
to
believe
my
words
—
yet
such
was
the
fact
.
<EOS>
Ay
,
"
he
continued
,
in
a
tone
of
profoundest
melancholy
,
"
I
was
once
proud
of
the
gifts
nature
had
vouchsafed
me
;
too
proud
,
alas
!
<EOS>
and
I
was
punished
for
my
vanity
and
self
-
boasting
.
<EOS>
In
those
days
I
loved
—
and
was
beloved
in
return
—
by
a
damsel
beautiful
as
Aveline
.
<EOS>
After
my
horrible
punishment
,
I
beheld
her
no
more
.
<EOS>
Knowing
she
must
regard
me
with
aversion
,
I
shunned
her
.
<EOS>
I
desired
not
to
be
an
object
of
pity
.
<EOS>
Bring
this
home
to
your
own
breast
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
and
think
how
direful
would
be
your
lot
to
be
driven
for
ever
from
her
you
love
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
such
has
been
my
case
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
bear
the
contemplation
—
it
were
madness
,
"
cried
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
brief
pause
,
after
which
Lanyere
resumed
his
story
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
the
time
of
being
cast
into
the
Fleet
Prison
,
my
prospects
were
fair
enough
.
<EOS>
When
I
came
forth
I
was
utterly
ruined
.
<EOS>
Existence
was
a
burden
to
me
,
and
I
should
have
ended
my
days
by
my
own
hand
,
if
the
insatiable
desire
of
vengeance
had
not
bound
me
to
the
world
.
<EOS>
For
this
alone
I
consented
to
live
—
to
bear
the
agonies
of
blighted
love
—
to
endure
the
scorn
and
taunts
of
all
with
whom
I
was
brought
into
contact
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
attached
myself
to
him
who
had
so
deeply
wronged
me
,
to
ensure
revenge
upon
him
.
<EOS>
My
great
fear
was
,
lest
I
should
be
robbed
of
this
precious
morsel
;
and
you
may
remember
that
I
struck
up
your
sword
when
it
had
touched
his
breast
.
<EOS>
He
must
die
by
no
other
hand
than
mine
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
vengeance
has
been
tardy
,
"
observed
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"True
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
delayed
it
for
several
reasons
,
but
chiefly
because
I
would
have
it
complete
.
<EOS>
The
work
is
begun
,
and
its
final
accomplishment
will
not
be
long
postponed
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
destroy
him
till
I
have
destroyed
the
superstructure
on
which
he
has
built
his
fortunes
—
till
all
has
crumbled
beneath
him
—
and
he
is
beggared
and
dishonoured
.
<EOS>
I
have
begun
the
work
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
Look
here
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
taking
a
parchment
from
his
doublet
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
give
much
for
this
deed
,
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
This
makes
me
lord
of
a
large
property
in
Norfolk
,
with
which
you
are
well
acquainted
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
can
not
mean
the
Mounchensey
estates
?
"
cried
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"
Yet
now
I
look
at
the
instrument
,
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
""I
obtained
this
assignment
by
stratagem
,
"
said
the
promoter
;
"
and
I
have
thereby
deprived
Sir
Giles
of
the
most
valuable
portion
of
his
spoils
;
and
though
;
he
thinks
to
win
it
back
again
,
he
will
find
himself
deceived
.
<EOS>
My
measures
are
too
well
taken
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
chief
prop
of
the
fabric
it
has
taken
him
so
long
to
rear
,
and
ere
long
I
will
shake
it
wholly
in
pieces
.
<EOS>
""But
if
you
have
become
unlawfully
possessed
of
this
property
,
as
would
appear
to
be
the
case
by
your
own
showing
,
you
can
not
hope
to
retain
it
,
"
said
the
young
knight
.
<EOS>
"Trust
<EOS>
me
<EOS>
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
I
shall
prove
a
better
title
to
it
than
Sir
Giles
could
exhibit
,
"
rejoined
Lanyere
;
"
but
this
is
not
a
time
for
full
explanation
.
<EOS>
If
I
carry
out
my
schemes
,
you
will
not
be
the
last
person
benefited
by
them
.
<EOS>
""Again
<EOS>
,
I
ask
you
,
what
possible
interest
you
can
feel
in
me
?
"
demanded
the
young
knight
with
curiosity
.
<EOS>
"Next
to
myself
,
you
have
been
most
injured
by
Sir
Giles
,
and
even
more
than
myself
are
you
an
object
of
dislike
to
him
.
<EOS>
These
would
suffice
to
excite
my
sympathy
towards
you
;
but
I
have
other
and
stronger
reasons
for
my
friendly
feeling
towards
you
,
which
in
due
season
you
shall
know
.
<EOS>
""All
<EOS>
your
proceedings
are
mysterious
,
"
observed
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"They
must
needs
be
so
from
the
circumstances
in
which
I
am
placed
.
<EOS>
I
am
compelled
to
veil
them
as
I
do
my
hateful
features
from
the
prying
eyes
of
men
:
but
they
will
be
made
clear
anon
,
and
you
will
then
understand
me
and
my
motives
better
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
what
is
this
?
"
<EOS>
he
suddenly
exclaimed
,
as
a
noise
outside
attracted
his
attention
.
<EOS>
"
Fly
!
fly
!
<EOS>
there
is
danger
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
the
warning
was
too
late
.
<EOS>
Ere
<EOS>
the
young
man
,
who
stood
irresolute
,
could
effect
his
retreat
from
the
back
of
the
cottage
,
the
door
was
thrown
open
,
and
a
serjeant
-
at
-
arms
,
with
three
attendants
in
black
gowns
and
flat
caps
,
and
having
black
staves
in
their
hands
,
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
had
partly
drawn
his
sword
,
but
restored
it
to
the
scabbard
on
a
glance
from
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
"Resistance
must
not
be
offered
,
"
said
the
latter
,
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
only
make
a
bad
matter
worse
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
serjeant
-
at
-
arms
,
a
tall
,
thin
man
,
with
a
sinister
aspect
,
advanced
towards
the
young
knight
,
and
touching
him
with
his
wand
<EOS>
,
said—"I
attach
your
person
,
Sir
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
,
in
virtue
of
a
warrant
,
which
I
hold
from
the
High
Court
of
Star
-
Chamber
.
<EOS>
""I
yield
myself
your
prisoner
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"
Whither
am
I
to
be
taken?""You
will
be
taken
before
the
Lords
of
the
Council
in
the
first
instance
,
and
afterwards
,
in
all
probability
,
be
consigned
to
the
custody
of
the
wardens
of
his
Majesty
's
gaol
of
the
Fleet
,
"
replied
the
serjeant
-
at
-
arms
.
<EOS>
"I
would
fain
know
the
nature
of
my
offence
?
"
said
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"You
will
learn
that
when
the
interrogatories
are
put
to
you
,
"
replied
the
official
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
told
you
have
disparaged
the
dignity
of
the
High
Court
,
and
that
is
an
offence
ever
severely
punished
.
<EOS>
Your
accuser
is
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
"Having
<EOS>
said
thus
much
,
the
serjeant
-
at
-
arms
turned
to
the
promoter
,
and
inquired
,
"
Are
you
not
Clement
Lanyere?""Why
<EOS>
do
you
ask
?
"
rejoined
the
other
.
<EOS>
"Because
<EOS>
if
you
are
he
,
I
must
request
you
to
accompany
me
to
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
""Lanyere
<EOS>
is
my
name
,
"
replied
the
other
;
"
and
if
I
decline
to
attend
you
,
as
you
request
,
it
is
from
no
disrespect
to
you
,
but
from
distaste
to
the
society
into
which
you
propose
to
bring
me
.
<EOS>
Your
warrant
does
not
extend
to
me?""It
<EOS>
does
not
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
serjeant
-
at
-
arms
.
"
<EOS>
Nevertheless—""Arrest
him
!
<EOS>
"
cried
a
voice
at
the
back
of
the
house,—and
a
window
being
thrown
open
,
the
face
of
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
appeared
at
it—"Arrest
him
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
the
extortioner
.
<EOS>
The
serjeant
-
at
-
arms
made
a
movement
,
as
if
of
compliance
;
but
Lanyere
bent
towards
him
,
and
whispered
a
few
words
in
his
ear
,
on
hearing
which
the
official
respectfully
retired
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
are
not
my
injunctions
obeyed
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Sir
Giles
,
furiously
,
from
the
window
.
<EOS>
"Because
<EOS>
he
has
rendered
me
good
reason
why
he
may
not
be
molested
by
us
—
or
by
any
one
else
,
"
replied
the
officer
,
significantly
.
<EOS>
Lanyere
looked
with
a
smile
of
triumph
at
the
extortioner
,
and
then
turning
to
Sir
Jocelyn
,
who
seemed
half
disposed
to
make
an
attack
upon
his
enemy
,
said
in
an
under
-
tone
,
"
Harm
him
not
.
<EOS>
Leave
him
to
me
.
"After
<EOS>
which
he
quitted
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
then
signed
to
the
serjeant
-
at
-
arms
to
remove
his
prisoner
,
and
disappeared
;
and
the
attendants
,
in
sable
cloaks
,
closing
round
Sir
Jocelyn
,
the
party
went
forth
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXII.The
Old
Fleet
Prison
.
<EOS>
Mention
is
made
of
a
prison
-
house
standing
near
the
River
Fleet
as
early
as
the
reign
of
Richard
I.
;
and
this
was
one
of
the
oldest
jails
in
London
,
as
its
first
wardens
,
whose
names
are
on
record
,
Nathaniel
de
Leveland
,
and
Robert
his
son
,
paid
,
in
1198
,
a
fine
of
sixty
marks
for
its
custody
;
affirming
"
that
it
had
been
their
inheritance
ever
since
the
Conquest
,
and
praying
that
they
might
not
be
hindered
therein
by
the
counter
-
fine
of
Osbert
de
Longchamp
,
"
to
whom
it
had
been
granted
by
the
lion
-
hearted
monarch
.
<EOS>
The
next
warden
of
the
Fleet
,
in
the
days
of
John
,
was
Simon
Fitz
-
Robert
,
Archdeacon
of
Wells,—probably
a
near
relative
of
Robert
de
Leveland
,
as
the
wardship
of
the
daughter
of
<EOS>
the
said
Robert
,
as
well
as
the
custody
of
the
jail
,
was
also
committed
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
freehold
of
the
prison
continued
in
the
Leveland
family
for
upwards
of
three
centuries
;
until
,
in
the
reign
of
Philip
and
Mary
it
was
,
sold
to
John
Heath
for
£
2300—a
large
sum
in
those
days
,
but
not
more
than
the
value
of
the
property
,
which
from
the
way
it
was
managed
produced
a
large
revenue
to
its
possessor
.
<EOS>
The
joint
wardens
of
the
Fleet
at
the
time
of
our
history
were
<EOS>
Sir
Henry
Lello
and
John
Eldred
;
but
their
office
was
executed
by
deputy
in
the
person
of
Joachim
Tunstall
,
by
whom
it
was
rented
.
<EOS>
As
will
naturally
be
supposed
,
it
was
the
object
of
every
deputy
-
warden
to
make
as
much
as
he
could
out
of
the
unfortunate
individuals
committed
to
his
charge
;
and
some
idea
of
the
infamous
practices
of
those
persons
may
be
gathered
,
from
a
petition
presented
to
the
Lords
of
the
Council
in
1586
by
the
then
prisoners
of
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
In
this
it
is
stated
that
the
warden
had
"
let
and
set
to
farm
the
victualling
and
lodging
of
all
the
house
and
prison
of
the
Fleet
to
one
John
Harvey
,
and
the
other
profits
of
the
said
<EOS>
Fleet
he
had
let
to
one
Thomas
Newport
,
the
deputy
there
under
the
warden
;
and
these
being
very
poor
men
,
having
neither
land
nor
any
trade
to
live
by
,
nor
any
certain
wages
of
the
said
warden
,
and
being
also
greedy
of
gain
,
did
live
by
bribing
and
extortion
.
<EOS>
That
they
did
most
shamefully
extort
and
exact
from
the
prisoners
,
raising
new
customs
,
fines
,
and
payments
,
for
their
own
advantage
.
<EOS>
That
they
cruelly
used
them
,
shutting
them
up
in
close
prisons
when
they
found
fault
with
their
wicked
dealings
;
not
suffering
them
to
come
and
go
as
they
ought
to
do
;
with
other
abominable
misdemeanours
,
which
,
without
reformation
,
might
be
the
poor
prisoners
'
utter
undoing
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
consequence
of
this
petition
,
a
commission
of
inquiry
into
the
alleged
abuses
was
appointed
;
but
little
good
was
effected
by
it
,
for
only
seven
years
later
further
complaints
were
made
against
the
warden
,
charging
him
with
"
murders
and
other
grave
misdemeanours
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Still
no
redress
was
obtained
;
nor
was
it
likely
it
would
be
,
when
the
cries
of
the
victims
of
this
abominable
system
of
oppression
were
so
easily
stifled
.
<EOS>
The
most
arbitrary
measures
were
resorted
to
by
the
officers
of
the
prison
,
and
carried
out
with
perfect
impunity
.
<EOS>
Their
authority
was
not
to
be
disputed
;
and
it
has
been
shown
how
obedience
was
enforced
.
<EOS>
Fines
were
inflicted
and
payment
made
compulsory
,
so
that
the
wealthy
prisoner
was
soon
reduced
to
beggary
.
<EOS>
Resistance
to
the
will
of
the
jailers
,
and
refusal
to
submit
to
their
exactions
,
were
severely
punished
.
<EOS>
Loaded
with
fetters
,
and
almost
deprived
of
food
,
the
miserable
captive
was
locked
up
in
a
noisome
subterranean
dungeon
;
and
,
if
he
continued
obstinate
,
was
left
to
rot
there
.
<EOS>
When
he
expired
,
his
death
was
laid
to
the
jail
-
fever
.
<EOS>
Rarely
were
these
dark
prison
secrets
divulged
,
though
frequently
hinted
at
.
<EOS>
The
moral
condition
of
the
prisoners
was
frightful
.
<EOS>
As
the
greater
portion
of
them
consisted
of
vicious
and
disorderly
characters
,
these
contaminated
the
whole
mass
,
so
that
the
place
became
a
complete
sink
of
abomination
.
<EOS>
Drunkenness
,
smoking
,
dicing
,
card
-
playing
,
and
every
kind
of
licence
were
permitted
,
or
connived
at
;
and
the
stronger
prisoners
were
allowed
to
plunder
the
weaker
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
state
of
things
in
the
Fleet
Prison
at
the
period
of
our
history
,
when
its
misgovernment
was
greater
than
it
had
ever
previously
been
,
and
the
condition
of
its
inmates
incomparably
worse
.
<EOS>
During
the
rebellion
of
Wat
Tyler
,
the
greater
part
of
the
buildings
constituting
the
ancient
prison
were
burnt
down
,
and
otherwise
destroyed
;
and
,
when
rebuilt
,
the
jail
was
strengthened
and
considerably
enlarged
.
<EOS>
Its
walls
were
of
stone
,
now
grim
and
hoary
with
age
;
and
on
the
side
next
to
the
Fleet
there
was
a
large
square
structure
,
resembling
Traitor
's
Gate
at
the
Tower
,
and
forming
the
sole
entrance
to
the
prison
.
<EOS>
To
this
gate
state
-
offenders
were
brought
by
water
after
committal
by
the
Council
of
the
Star
-
Chamber
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
sterner
or
gloomier
than
the
aspect
of
the
prison
on
this
side
—
gray
and
frowning
walls
,
with
a
few
sombre
buildings
peeping
above
them
,
and
a
black
gateway
,
with
a
yawning
arch
,
as
if
looking
ready
to
devour
the
unfortunate
being
who
approached
it
.
<EOS>
Passing
through
a
wicket
,
contrived
in
the
ponderous
door
,
a
second
gate
was
arrived
at
,
and
this
brought
the
captive
to
the
porter
's
lodge
,
where
he
was
delivered
up
to
the
jailers
,
and
assigned
a
room
in
one
of
the
wards
,
according
to
his
means
of
paying
for
it
.
<EOS>
The
best
of
these
lodgings
were
but
indifferent
;
and
the
worst
were
abominable
and
noisome
pits
.
<EOS>
On
entering
the
outer
ward
,
a
strange
scene
presented
itself
to
the
view
.
<EOS>
Motley
groups
were
scattered
about
—
most
of
the
persons
composing
them
being
clad
in
threadbare
doublets
and
tattered
cloaks
,
and
wearing
caps
,
from
which
the
feathers
and
ornaments
had
long
since
disappeared
;
but
there
were
a
few
—
probably
new
coiners
—
in
somewhat
better
attire
.
<EOS>
All
these
wore
debtors
.
<EOS>
Recklessness
and
effrontery
were
displayed
in
their
countenances
,
and
their
discourse
was
full
of
ribaldry
and
profanity
.
<EOS>
At
one
side
of
this
ward
there
was
a
large
kitchen
,
where
eating
and
drinking
were
constantly
going
forward
at
little
tables
,
as
at
a
tavern
or
cookshop
,
and
where
commons
were
served
out
to
the
poorer
prisoners
.
<EOS>
Near
this
was
a
large
hall
,
which
served
as
the
refectory
of
the
prisoners
for
debt
.
<EOS>
It
was
furnished
with
side
benches
of
oak
,
and
had
two
long
tables
of
the
same
wood
;
but
both
benches
and
tables
were
in
a
filthy
state
,
and
the
floor
was
never
cleansed
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
every
part
of
the
prison
was
foul
enough
to
breed
a
pestilence
;
and
the
place
was
seldom
free
from
fever
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
The
upper
part
of
the
refectory
was
traversed
by
a
long
corridor
,
on
either
side
of
which
were
the
dormitories
.
<EOS>
The
arrangements
of
the
inner
ward
were
nearly
similar
,
and
differed
only
from
the
outer
,
in
so
far
that
the
accommodations
were
superior
,
as
they
had
need
to
be
,
considering
the
price
asked
for
them
;
but
even
here
nothing
like
cleanliness
could
be
found
.
<EOS>
In
this
ward
was
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
At
a
grated
window
in
the
gate
stood
the
poor
debtors
rattling
their
begging
-
boxes
,
and
endeavouring
by
their
cries
to
obtain
alms
from
the
passers
-
by
.
<EOS>
Below
the
warden
's
lodgings
,
which
adjoined
the
gate
,
and
which
were
now
occupied
by
the
deputy
,
Joachim
Tunstall
,
was
a
range
of
subterranean
dungeons
,
built
below
the
level
of
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
Frequently
flooded
by
the
river
,
these
dungeons
were
exceedingly
damp
and
unwholesome
;
and
they
were
reserved
for
such
prisoners
as
had
incurred
the
censure
of
the
inexorable
Court
of
Star
-
Chamber
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
one
of
the
deepest
and
most
dismal
of
these
cells
that
the
unfortunate
Sir
Ferdinando
Mounchensey
breathed
his
last
.
<EOS>
Allusion
has
been
previously
made
to
the
influence
exercised
within
the
Fleet
by
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
Both
the
wardens
were
his
friends
,
and
ever
ready
to
serve
him
;
their
deputy
was
his
creature
,
and
subservient
to
his
will
in
all
things
;
while
the
jailers
and
their
assistants
took
his
orders
,
whatever
they
might
be
,
as
if
from
a
master
.
<EOS>
Thus
he
was
enabled
to
tyrannize
over
the
objects
of
his
displeasure
,
who
could
never
be
secure
from
his
malice
.
<EOS>
By
the
modes
of
torture
he
adopted
through
his
agents
,
he
could
break
the
most
stubborn
spirit
,
and
subdue
the
strongest
.
<EOS>
It
was
matter
of
savage
satisfaction
to
him
to
witness
the
sufferings
of
his
victims
;
and
he
never
ceased
from
persecution
till
he
had
obtained
whatever
he
desired
.
<EOS>
The
barbarities
carried
out
in
pursuance
of
the
atrocious
sentences
of
the
Court
of
Star
-
Chamber
were
to
him
pleasant
spectacles
;
and
the
bleeding
and
mutilated
wretches
,
whom
his
accusations
had
conducted
to
the
pillory
,
when
brought
back
to
their
dungeons
,
could
not
escape
his
hateful
presence
—
worse
to
them
,
from
his
fiendish
derision
of
their
agonies
,
than
that
of
the
executioner
.

CHAPTER
XXIII.How
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
was
brought
to
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
After
his
arrest
by
the
serjeant
-
at
-
arms
,
Sir
Jocelyn
was
taken
,
in
the
first
instance
,
to
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
where
some
of
the
Lords
of
the
Council
were
sitting
at
the
time
,
and
examined
respecting
the
"
libellous
language
and
false
scandal
"
he
had
used
in
reference
to
the
proceedings
of
that
high
and
honourable
court
.
<EOS>
The
young
knight
did
not
attempt
to
deny
the
truth
of
the
charge
brought
against
him
,
neither
did
he
express
contrition
,
or
sue
for
forgiveness
;
but
though
he
demanded
to
be
confronted
with
his
accusers
,
the
request
was
refused
him
;
and
he
was
told
they
would
appear
in
due
time
.
<EOS>
Several
interrogatories
were
then
addressed
to
him
,
which
he
answered
in
a
manner
calculated
,
in
the
judgment
of
his
hearers
,
to
aggravate
the
original
offence
.
<EOS>
After
this
,
he
was
required
to
subscribe
the
minutes
of
his
confession
,
as
it
was
styled
;
and
a
warant
for
his
committal
to
the
Fleet
Prison
,
and
close
confinement
within
it
,
was
made
out
.
<EOS>
Consigned
once
more
to
the
custody
of
the
serjeant
-
at
-
arms
,
he
was
placed
on
board
a
barge
,
of
ill
-
omened
appearance
,
being
covered
with
black
cloth
,
like
a
Venetian
gondola
,
and
kept
for
offenders
against
the
Star
-
Chamber
.
<EOS>
In
this
he
was
rowed
down
the
Thames
,
and
up
the
Fleet
,
to
the
entrance
of
the
prison
.
<EOS>
The
progress
of
the
well
-
known
sable
barge
up
the
narrow
river
having
been
noted
by
the
passengers
along
its
banks
,
as
well
as
by
those
crossing
Fleet
Bridge
,
some
curiosity
was
felt
to
ascertain
whom
it
contained
;
and
a
crowd
collected
in
front
of
the
prison
gate
to
witness
the
disembarkation
.
<EOS>
When
the
young
knight
's
title
,
and
the
nature
of
his
offence
,
which
latter
did
not
appear
so
enormous
in
their
eyes
as
in
those
of
the
Lords
of
the
Council
,
became
known
to
the
bystanders
,
much
sympathy
was
expressed
for
him
;
and
it
might
have
found
a
manifestation
in
more
than
words
,
but
for
the
guard
,
who
kept
back
the
throng
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
Sir
Jocelyn
heard
his
own
name
pronounced
in
familiar
tones
,
and
looking
round
for
the
speaker
,
perceived
a
person
placed
in
a
tub
close
beside
him
.
<EOS>
The
individual
who
occupied
this
singular
and
degrading
position
was
the
ill
-
starred
Dick
Taverner
,
who
,
it
appeared
,
had
made
an
attempt
to
escape
from
prison
on
the
third
day
after
he
had
been
brought
thither
,
and
was
punished
,
according
to
the
custom
of
the
place
,
by
being
bound
hand
and
foot
,
set
within
a
tub
,
and
exposed
to
public
gaze
and
derision
.
<EOS>
"Alas
!
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
!
<EOS>
"
ejaculated
the
apprentice
,
"
but
for
you
I
should
not
have
been
here
.
<EOS>
I
undertook
a
thankless
office
,
and
have
been
rightly
served
for
my
folly
.
<EOS>
We
have
both
found
our
way
to
the
Fleet
,
but
I
much
doubt
if
either
of
us
will
find
his
way
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
I
liked
the
appearance
of
the
place
,
and
the
society
it
seems
to
furnish
,
so
little
,
that
I
resolved
to
make
a
clearance
of
it
at
once
;
and
accordingly
I
managed
to
scramble
up
yonder
lofty
wall
,
in
the
hope
of
effecting
my
deliverance
,
without
asking
for
a
licence
to
go
abroad
from
the
warden
;
but
,
unfortunately
,
in
dropping
down
from
so
great
a
height
<EOS>
I
sprained
my
ankle
,
and
fell
again
into
the
hands
of
the
Philistines
—
and
here
I
am
,
like
the
Cynic
philosopher
in
his
tub
.
<EOS>
"Sir
<EOS>
Jocelyn
would
have
addressed
a
few
words
of
consolation
to
the
poor
fellow
,
but
at
this
moment
the
wicket
was
opened
,
and
he
was
pushed
through
it
by
the
attendants
of
the
serjeant
-
at
-
arms
,
who
were
apprehensive
of
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
The
small
aperture
that
had
given
him
admittance
to
the
prison
was
instantly
closed
,
and
all
chance
of
rescue
cut
off
.
<EOS>
The
prisoner
being
thus
effectually
secured
,
the
officials
felt
more
easy
;
and
smiling
at
each
other
,
they
proceeded
deliberately
to
the
porter
's
lodge
,
at
the
entrance
of
which
stood
a
huge
,
powerfully
-
built
,
ill
-
favoured
man
,
evidently
chosen
for
the
post
of
porter
from
his
personal
strength
and
the
savageness
of
his
disposition
.
<EOS>
With
a
growl
like
that
of
a
mastiff
,
to
the
black
broad
muzzle
of
which
animal
<EOS>
his
own
features
bore
a
remarkable
resemblance
,
the
porter
greeted
the
new
comers
,
and
ushered
them
into
an
apartment
built
of
stone
,
octagonal
in
shape
,
with
a
vaulted
roof
,
narrow
windows
like
loopholes
,
and
a
great
stone
fireplace
.
<EOS>
Its
walls
,
which
resembled
those
of
an
ancient
guardroom
,
were
appropriately
enough
garnished
with
fetters
;
mixed
up
with
which
,
as
if
to
inspire
greater
terror
among
the
beholders
,
were
an
executioner
's
heavy
whip
,
with
many
knotted
thongs
,
several
knives
,
with
strange
blades
,
the
purpose
of
which
was
obvious
enough
,
and
branding
-
irons
.
<EOS>
As
Sir
Jocelyn
was
brought
into
the
lodge
by
his
guards
,
an
elderly
man
,
with
a
bald
head
and
gray
beard
and
moustaches
,
and
possessing
,
in
spite
of
his
years
,
a
most
repulsive
physiognomy
,
advanced
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
His
doublet
and
hose
were
of
murrey
-
colour
;
and
his
inflamed
visage
,
blood
-
shot
eyes
,
fiery
nose
,
and
blotchy
forehead
,
were
in
keeping
with
the
hue
of
his
apparel
.
<EOS>
This
was
Joachim
Tunstall
,
Deputy
Warden
of
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
Behind
him
were
some
half
-
dozen
jailers
,
attired
in
garments
of
dark
-
brown
frieze
,
and
each
having
a
large
bunch
of
keys
at
his
girdle
.
<EOS>
All
of
them
were
stout
,
hard
-
featured
men
,
and
bore
upon
their
countenances
the
stamp
of
their
vocation
.
<EOS>
The
warrant
for
Sir
Jocelyn
's
committal
to
the
Fleet
was
delivered
by
the
serjeant
-
at
-
arms
to
the
deputy
-
warden
;
and
the
latter
having
duly
perused
it
,
was
conferring
with
one
of
the
jailers
as
to
where
the
prisoner
should
be
conducted
,
when
a
side
-
door
was
suddenly
opened
,
and
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
issuing
from
it
,
tapped
the
deputy
-
warden
on
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
need
not
consider
where
the
prisoner
is
to
be
lodged
,
Master
Tunstall
,
"
he
said
,
looking
fixedly
at
Mounchensey
all
the
while
.
<EOS>
"
The
dungeon
he
is
to
occupy
is
the
darkest
,
the
deepest
and
the
dampest
in
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
It
is
that
in
which
his
father
died
.
<EOS>
You
know
it
well
,
Grimbald
,
"
he
added
,
to
one
of
the
burliest
of
the
jailers
.
<EOS>
"
Take
him
thither
at
once
,
and
I
will
go
with
you
to
see
him
safely
bestowed
.
<EOS>
"Pass
<EOS>
on
,
Sir
,
"
he
continued
,
with
a
smile
of
fiendish
satisfaction
,
as
Mounchensey
was
led
forth
by
the
jailer
.
<EOS>
Chapter
XXIV.The
Abduction
.
<EOS>
Night
had
come
on
,
and
Aveline
was
anxiously
expecting
the
arrival
of
her
lover
,
when
a
loud
knocking
was
heard
at
the
door
of
the
cottage
;
and
before
the
summons
could
be
answered
by
Anthony
Rocke
,
two
persons
entered
,
and
pushing
past
the
old
serving
-
man
,
who
demanded
their
business
,
and
vainly
endeavoured
to
oppose
their
progress
,
forced
their
way
into
the
presence
of
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
Dame
Sherborne
was
in
an
inner
room
,
but
,
alarmed
by
the
noise
,
she
flew
to
the
aid
of
her
charge
,
and
reached
her
at
the
same
moment
with
the
intruders
.
<EOS>
Her
lamp
threw
its
light
full
upon
their
countenances
;
and
when
she
found
who
they
were
,
she
screamed
and
nearly
let
it
fall
,
appearing
to
stand
much
more
in
need
of
support
than
Aveline
herself
.
<EOS>
The
foremost
of
the
two
was
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
,
and
his
usually
stern
and
sinister
features
had
acquired
a
yet
more
inauspicious
cast
,
from
the
deathlike
paleness
that
bespread
them
,
as
well
as
from
the
fillet
bound
round
<EOS>
his
injured
brow
.
<EOS>
The
other
was
an
antiquated
coxcomb
,
aping
the
airs
and
graces
of
a
youthful
gallant
,
attired
in
silks
and
velvets
fashioned
in
the
newest
French
mode
,
and
exhaling
a
mingled
perfume
of
civet
,
musk
,
and
ambergris
;
and
in
him
Aveline
recognised
the
amorous
old
dotard
,
who
had
stared
at
her
so
offensively
during
the
visit
she
had
been
forced
to
make
to
the
extortioner
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
's
deportment
was
not
a
whit
less
impertinent
or
objectionable
now
than
heretofore
.
<EOS>
After
making
a
profound
salutation
to
Aveline
,
which
he
thought
was
executed
in
the
most
courtly
style
,
and
with
consummate
grace
,
he
observed
in
a
loud
whisper
to
his
partner
,
"
'
Fore
heaven
!
<EOS>
a
matchless
creature
!
<EOS>
a
divinity
!
<EOS>
Introduce
me
in
due
form
,
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
""Suffer
me
to
make
known
to
you
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
,
fair
mistress
,
"
said
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
so
ravished
by
your
charms
that
he
can
neither
eat
,
drink
,
nor
sleep
;
and
he
professes
to
me
,
his
friend
and
partner
,
that
he
must
die
outright
,
unless
you
take
pity
on
him
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
so
,
Sir
Francis
?
<EOS>
Nay
,
plead
your
own
cause
,
man
.
<EOS>
You
will
do
it
better
than
I
,
who
am
little
accustomed
to
tune
my
voice
to
the
ear
of
beauty
.
<EOS>
"During
<EOS>
this
speech
,
the
old
usurer
conducted
himself
in
a
manner
that
,
under
other
circumstances
,
must
have
moved
Aveline
's
mirth
;
but
it
now
only
excited
her
disgust
and
indignation
.
<EOS>
Sighing
,
groaning
placing
his
hand
upon
his
heart
,
languishingly
regarding
her
,
and
turning
up
his
eyes
till
<EOS>
the
whites
alone
were
visible
,
he
ended
by
throwing
himself
at
her
feet
,
seizing
her
hand
,
and
attempting
to
cover
it
with
kisses
.
<EOS>
"Deign
<EOS>
to
listen
to
me
,
peerless
and
adorable
damsel
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
cried
in
the
most
impassioned
accents
he
could
command
,
though
he
wheezed
terribly
all
the
while
,
and
was
ever
and
anon
interrupted
by
a
fit
of
coughing
.
"
<EOS>
Incline
your
ear
to
me
,
I
beseech
you
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
has
in
no
respect
exaggerated
my
sad
condition
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
I
beheld
you
I
have
been
able
to
do
nothing
else
than
—
ough
!
<EOS>
ough!—dwell
upon
your
surpassing
attractions
.
<EOS>
Day
and
night
your
lovely
image
has
been
constantly
before
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
driven
sleep
from
my
eyelids
,
and

Your

eyes
have
lighted
up
such
a
fire
in
my
breast
as
can
never
be
extinguished
,
unless—(ough

<EOS>
ough

take
this
cough

<EOS>
I
owe
it
to
you

fair
mistress
of
my
heart
,
as
well
as
my
other
torments

<EOS>
But
as
I
was
about
to
say
,
the
raging
flame
you
have
kindled
in
my
breast
will
utterly
consume
me
,

<EOS>
ough

<EOS>
ough!)"Here
he
was
well
-
nigh
choked
,
and
Sir
Giles
had
to
come
to
his
assistance
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
my
worthy
friend
and
partner
would
declare
,
if
his
cough
permitted
him
,
fair
Mistress
Aveline
,
"
urged
the
extortioner
,
"
is
that
he
places
his
life
and
fortune
at
your
disposal
.
<EOS>
His
desires
are
all
centred
in
you
,
and
it
rests
with
you
to
make
him
the
happiest
or
most
miserable
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
Speak
I
not
your
sentiments
,
Sir
Francis?""In
<EOS>
every
particular
,
good
Sir
Giles

replied
the
other
,
as
soon
as
he
could
recover
utterance
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
most
adorable
damsel
<EOS>
,
what
say
you
in
answer
?
<EOS>
You
are
too
gentle
,
I
am
sure
,
to
condemn
your
slave
to
endless
tortures
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
motion
me
not
to
rise
.
<EOS>
I
have
that
to
say
will
disarm
your
frowns
,
and
turn
them
into
smiles
of
approval
and
assent
.
<EOS>
(
O
,
this
accursed
rheumatism
!
"
<EOS>
he
muttered
to
himself
,
"
I
shall
never
be
able
to
get
up
unaided
!
)
<EOS>
I
love
you
,
incomparable
creature
—
love
you
to
distraction
;
and
as
your
beauty
has
inflicted
such
desperate
wounds
upon
my
heart
,
so
I
am
sure
your
gentleness
will
not
fail
to
cure
them
.
<EOS>
Devotion
like
mine
must
meet
its
reward
.
<EOS>
Your
answer

divinest
creature

<EOS>

let
it
be
favourable
to
my
hopes
,
I
conjure
you!""I
<EOS>
have
no
other
answer
to
give

"
replied
Aveline
,
coldly
,
and
with
an
offended
look
,
"
except
such
as
any
maiden
,
thus
unwarrantably
and
unseasonably
importuned
,
would
make
.
<EOS>
Your
addresses
are
utterly
distasteful
to
me
,

I
pray
you
to
desist
them
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
real
wish
to
oblige
me
,
you
will
at
once
free
me
from
your
presence

<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
hand
,
Sir
Giles
—
your
hand
!
"
cried
the
old
usurer
,
raising
himself
to
his
feet
with
difficulty
,
"
So
,
you
are
not
to
be
moved
by
my
sufferings
—
by
my
prayers
,
cruel
and
proud
beauty
?
"
<EOS>
he
continued
,
regarding
her
with
a
mortified
and
spiteful
look
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
inflexible
—
eh?""Utterly
so
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"Anthony
Rocke
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Dame
Sherborne
,
"
show
the
gentlemen
to
the
door
—
and
bolt
it
upon
them
,
"
she
added
,
in
a
lower
tone
.
"Not
<EOS>
so
fast
,
Madam
—
not
so
fast
!
"
exclaimed
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
not
trouble
old
Anthony
just
yet
.
<EOS>
Though
his
fair
young
mistress
is
indisposed
to
listen
to
the
pleadings
of
love
,
it
follows
not
she
will
be
equally
insensible
to
the
controlling
power
of
her
father
's
delegated
authority
.
<EOS>
Her
hand
must
be
mine
,
either
freely
,
or
by
compulsion
.
<EOS>
Let
her
know
on
what
grounds
<EOS>
I
claim
it
,
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
claim
can
not
be
resisted
,
Sir
Francis
,
"
rejoined
the
other
;
"
and
if
you
had
followed
my
counsel
,
you
would
not
have
condescended
to
play
the
abject
wooer
,
but
have
adopted
the
manlier
course
,
and
demanded
her
hand
as
your
right
.
<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
Sir
Giles
,
you
can
not
wonder
at
me
,
knowing
how
infatuated
I
am
by
this
rare
and
admirable
creature
.
<EOS>
I
was
unwilling
to
assert
my
rights
till
all
other
means
of
obtaining
her
hand
had
failed
.
<EOS>
But
now
I
have
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
""Whence
is
your
authority
derived
?
"
inquired
Aveline
,
trembling
as
she
put
the
question
.
<EOS>
"From
your
dead
father
,
"
said
Sir
Giles
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
last
solemn
injunctions
to
you
were
,
<EOS>
that
you
should
we
d
the
man
to
whom
he
had
promised
you
;
provided
your
hand
were
claimed
by
him
within
a
year
after
his
death
.
<EOS>
With
equal
solemnity
you
bound
yourself
to
fulfil
his
wishes
.
<EOS>
The
person
to
whom
you
were
thus
sacredly
contracted
is
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
;
and
now
,
in
your
father
's
name
,
and
by
your
father
's
authority
,
he
demands
fulfilment
of
the
solemn
pledge
.
<EOS>
""O
,
this
is
wholly
impossible!—I
will
not
believe
it
!
<EOS>
"
almost
shrieked
Aveline
,
throwing
herself
into
Dame
Sherborne
's
arms
.
<EOS>
"It
is
some
wicked
device
to
ensnare
you
,
I
am
convinced
,
"
said
the
old
lady
,
clasping
her
to
her
breast
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
defy
them
,
as
we
do
the
Prince
of
Darkness
,
and
all
his
iniquities
.
<EOS>
Avoid
thee
,
thou
wicked
old
sinner!—thou
worse
than
the
benighted
heathen
!
<EOS>
Get
hence
!
<EOS>
I
say
,
Sathanas
!
<EOS>
"
she
ejaculated
to
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
I
am
well
assured
it
is
all
a
fabrication
,
"
said
Anthony
Rocke
.
<EOS>
"
My
master
had
too
much
consideration
and
tenderness
for
his
daughter
to
promise
her
to
a
wretched
old
huncks
like
this
,
with
one
foot
in
the
grave
already
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
knew
he
held
both
him
and
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
in
utter
abomination
and
contempt
.
<EOS>
The
thing
is
,
therefore
,
not
only
improbable
,
but
altogether
impossible
.
<EOS>
""Hold
<EOS>
thy
peace
,
sirrah
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sir
Francis
,
foaming
with
rage
,
"
or
I
will
cut
thy
scurril
tongue
out
of
thy
throat
.
<EOS>
Huncks
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
As
I
am
a
true
gentleman
,
if
thou
wert
of
my
own
degree
,
thou
shouldst
answer
for
the
opprobrious
expression
.
<EOS>
""What
proof
have
you
that
my
father
entered
into
any
such
engagement
with
you
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Aveline
,
turning
to
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
bare
assertion
will
scarcely
satisfy
me
.
<EOS>
""Neither
<EOS>
will
it
satisfy
me
,
"
remarked
Anthony
.
<EOS>
"
Let
him
produce
his
proofs
.
<EOS>
""You
are
acquainted
with
your
father
's
handwriting
,
I
presume
,
fair
maiden
?
"
rejoined
Sir
Francis
.
"
<EOS>
And
it
may
be
that
your
insolent
and
incredulous
serving
-
man
is
also
acquainted
with
it
.
<EOS>
Look
at
this
document
,
and
declare
whether
it
be
not
,
as
I
assert
,
traced
in
Hugh
Calveley
's
characters
.
<EOS>
Look
at
it
,
I
say
,
thou
unbelieving
hound
,
"
he
added
,
to
Anthony
,
"
and
contradict
me
if
thou
canst
.
<EOS>
""It
is
my
master
's
writing
,
I
am
compelled
to
admit
,
"
replied
the
old
serving
-
man
,
with
a
groan
.
<EOS>
"Are
<EOS>
you
prepared
to
render
obedience
to
your
father
's
behests
,
maiden
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Sir
Giles
,
menacingly
.
<EOS>
"O
,
give
me
counsel
!
<EOS>
What
shall
I
say
to
them
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Aveline
,
appealing
to
Dame
Sherborne
.
"
<EOS>
Would
that
Sir
Jocelyn
were
here!""It
is
in
vain
to
expect
his
coming
,
"
rejoined
Sir
Giles
,
with
a
bitter
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
taken
good
care
to
keep
him
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
""There
is
no
help
then
!
"
<EOS>
said
Aveline
,
despairingly
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
submit
.
<EOS>
""We
triumph
,
"
whispered
Sir
Giles
to
his
partner
.
<EOS>
"Talk
not
of
submission
,
my
dear
young
lady
,
"
implored
Anthony
Rocke
.
<EOS>
"
Resist
them
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
I
will
shed
my
best
blood
in
your
defence
.
<EOS>
If
my
master
did
give
them
that
paper
he
must
have
been
out
of
his
senses
,
and
you
need
not
,
therefore
,
regard
it
as
other
than
the
act
of
a
madman
.
<EOS>
""Peace
,
shallow
-
pated
fool
!
"
cried
Sir
Giles
.
"
<EOS>
And
do
you
,
fair
mistress
,
attend
to
me
,
and
you
shall
learn
under
what
circumstances
that
contract
was
made
,
and
how
it
becomes
binding
upon
you
.
<EOS>
Deeply
indebted
to
Sir
Francis
,
your
father
had
only
one
means
of
discharging
his
obligations
.
<EOS>
He
did
hesitate
to
avail
himself
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
promised
you
to
his
creditor
,
and
obtained
his
own
release
.
<EOS>
Will
you
dishonour
his
memory
by
a
refusal?""O
,
if
this
tale
be
true
,
I
have
no
escape
from
misery
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Aveline
.
"
<EOS>
And
it
wears
the
semblance
of
probability
.
<EOS>
""I
take
upon
me
to
declare
it
to
be
false
,
"
cried
Anthony
Rocke
.
<EOS>
"Another
<EOS>
such
insolent
speech
shall
cost
thee
thy
life

sirrah
!

<EOS>
cried
Sir
Giles
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"Read
over
the
paper
again
,
my
dear
young
lady
,
"
said
Dame
Sherborne
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
,
perhaps
,
find
something
in
it
not

discovered
,
which
may
help
you
to
a
better
understanding
of
your
father
's
wishes
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
read
it!—read
it
!
"
cried
the
old
usurer
,
giving
her
the
paper
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
perceive
in
what
energetic
terms
<EOS>
your
father
enjoins
compliance
on
your
part
with
his
commands
;
and
<EOS>
what
awful
denunciations
he
attaches
to
your
disobedience
.
<EOS>
Read
it
,
I
say
,
and
fancy
he
is
speaking
to
you
from
the
grave
in
these
terms—'Take
this
man
for
thy
husband
,
O
my
daughter
,
and
take
my
blessing
with
him

<EOS>
Reject
him

my
curse
shall
alight
upon
thy
head

<EOS>
'"But
Aveline
was
too
much
engrossed
to
heed
him
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
her
eye
caught
something
she
had
not
previously
noticed
,
and
she
exclaimed,—"I
have
detected
the
stratagem

<EOS>
I
knew
this
authority
could
never
be
committed
to
you

<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
mean
you
,
fair
mistress

cried
Sir
Francis
,
surprised
and
alarmed
.
<EOS>
"
My
name
may
not
appear
upon
the
face
of
the
document

,
nevertheless
,
I
am
the
person

to
by
it

<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
document
itself
disproves
your
assertion

"
cried
Aveline
,
with
exultation
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
so
?
"
demanded
Sir
Giles
,
uneasily
.
"Why
<EOS>
,
see
you
not
that
he
to

my
father
designed

give
my
hand

named

exclaimed
Sir
Giles
,
starting
.
<EOS>
"This
is
pure
invention
!

cried
Sir
Francis

<EOS>
"
There
is
no
such
name

paper

no
name

all

could
there
be
any

reasons

will
presently
explain

<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
your

eyes
convince
you

she
rejoined
,
extending
the
paper
to
him

revealing
to
his
astounded
gaze

to
that
of
his
partner
,
who
looked
petrified
with
surprise

the
name
plainly
written
as
she
had
described
it
.
"How
<EOS>
came
it
there

<EOS>
cried
Sir
Giles
,
as
soon
as
he
could
command
himself
.
<EOS>
"I
can
not

replied
Sir
Francis

<EOS>
"
I
only
know
it
was
not
there

be
Clement
Lanyere

handiwork

he
added
in
a
whisper

<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
see
not
how
that
can
be

replied
the
other
,
in
a
like
low
tone

The
alteration
must
have
been
made

It

not

escaped
my
observation

<EOS>
""Nor
mine

cried
Sir

'
T
is
passing
strange!""Your

Aveline

""And

all
his
wonted
audacity

not

the
old
usurer

I
still
trust
you

listen

put
in
practice

stratagem

what
matters
it

All
is
fair
in
love

And
if
you
knew
all

you
would
be
aware

already

so
dearly

Cost
what

""Never

Aveline

resolutely

soon
alter
your
tone

A
litter

put
our
forbearance

Sir

me
lead
you
to

<EOS>
"As
he
advanced
towards
her
,
Aveline
drew
quickly
back
,
and
Dame
Sherborne
uttered
a
loud
scream
;
but
her
cries
brought
no
other
help
than
could
be
afforded
by
old
Anthony
Rocke
,
who
,
planting
himself
before
his
young
mistress
,
menaced
Sir
Francis
to
retire

this
state
of
things
was
only
of
brief
duration
.
<EOS>
It
speedily
appeared
that
the
two
extortioners
had
abundant
assistance
at
hand
to
carry
out
their
infamous
design
.
<EOS>
A
whistle
was
sounded
by
Sir
Giles
;
and
at
the
call
the
cottage
door
was
burst
open
by
some
half
dozen
of
the
myrmidons
,
headed
by
Captain
Bludder
.
<EOS>
Any
resistance
that
the
old
serving
-
man
could
offer
was
speedily
overcome
.
<EOS>
Knocked
down
by
a
pike
,
he
was
gagged
and
pinioned
,
and
carried
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
cries
of
Aveline
and
the
elderly
dame
were
stifled
by
scarves
tied
over
their
heads
;
and
both
being
in
a
fainting
condition
from
fright
,
they
were
borne
to
the
litter
which
was
standing
at
the
door
,
and
being
shut
up
within
it
,
were
conveyed
as
quickly
as
might
be
to
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
's
mansion
,
near
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
Thither
,
also
,
was
old
Anthony
Rocke
taken
,
closely
guarded
on
the
way
by
two
of
the
myrmidons
.

CHAPTER
XXV.The
"
Stone
Coffin
.
<EOS>
"A
dreadful
dungeon
!
<EOS>
the
last
and
profoundest
of
the
range
of
subterranean
cells
already
described
as
built
below
the
level
of
the
river
Fleet
:
a
relict
,
in
fact
,
of
the
ancient
prison
which
had
escaped
the
fury
of
Wat
Tyler
and
his
followers
,
when
the
rest
of
the
structure
was
destroyed
by
them
.
<EOS>
Not
inaptly
was
the
dungeon
styled
the
"
Stone
Coffin
.
<EOS>
"
Those
immured
within
it
seldom
lived
long
.
<EOS>
A
chill
like
that
of
death
smote
Sir
Jocelyn
,
as
he
halted
before
the
door
of
this
horrible
place
.
<EOS>
Preceded
by
Grimbald
the
jailer
,
with
a
lamp
in
one
hand
and
a
bunch
of
large
keys
in
the
other
,
and
closely
followed
by
the
deputy
-
warden
and
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
,
our
young
knight
had
traversed
an
underground
corridor
with
cells
on
one
side
of
it
,
and
then
,
descending
a
flight
of
stone
steps
,
had
reached
a
still
lower
pit
,
in
which
the
dismal
receptacle
was
situated
.
<EOS>
Here
he
remained
up
to
the
ankles
in
mud
and
water
,
while
Grimbald
unlocked
the
ponderous
door
,
and
with
a
grin
revealed
the
interior
of
the
cavernous
recess
.
<EOS>
Nothing
more
dank
and
noisome
could
be
imagined
than
the
dungeon
.
<EOS>
Dripping
stone
-
walls
,
a
truckle
-
bed
with
a
mouldy
straw
-
mattrass
,
rotting
litter
scattered
about
,
a
floor
glistening
and
slippery
with
ooze
,
and
a
deep
pool
of
water
,
like
that
outside
,
at
the
further
end,—these
constituted
the
materials
of
the
frightful
picture
presented
to
the
gaze
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
Sir
Jocelyn
should
recoil
,
and
refuse
to
enter
the
cell
.
<EOS>
"You
do
n't
seem
to
like
your
lodgings
,
worshipful
Sir
,
"
said
Grimbald
,
still
grinning
,
as
he
held
up
the
lamp
;
"
but
you
will
soon
get
used
to
the
place
,
and
you
will
not
lack
company
—
<EOS>
rats
<EOS>
,
I
mean
:
they
come
from
the
Fleet
in
swarms
.
<EOS>
Look
!
<EOS>
a
score
of
'em
are
making
off
yonder
—
swimming
to
their
holes
.
<EOS>
But
they
will
come
back
again
with
some
of
their
comrades
,
when
you
are
left
alone
,
and
without
a
light
.
<EOS>
Unlike
other
vermin
,
the
rats
of
the
Fleet
are
extraordinarily
sociable
—
ho
!
<EOS>
ho!"And
,
<EOS>
chuckling
at
his
own
jest
,
Grimbald
turned
to
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
,
who
,
with
Joachim
Tunstall
,
was
standing
at
the
summit
of
the
steps
,
as
if
unwilling
to
venture
into
the
damp
region
below
,
and
observed—"The
worshipful
gentleman
does
not
like
the
appearance
of
his
quarters
,
it
seems
,
Sir
Giles
;
but
we
can
not
give
him
better,—and
,
though
the
cell
might
be
somewhat
more
comfortable
if
it
were
drier
,
and
perhaps
more
wholesome
,
yet
it
is
uncommonly
quiet
,
and
double
the
size
of
any
other
in
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
I
never
could
understand
why
it
should
be
called
the
'
Stone
Coffin'—but
<EOS>
so
it
is
.
<EOS>
Some
prisoners
have
imagined
they
would
get
their
death
with
cold
from
a
single
night
passed
within
it
—
but
that
's
a
mistaken
notion
altogether
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
proof
to
the
contrary
in
Sir
Ferdinando
Mounchensey
,
father
of
the
present
prisoner
,
"
said
Sir
Giles
,
in
a
derisive
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
occupied
that
cell
for
more
than
six
months
.
<EOS>
Did
he
not
,
good
Grimbald
?
<EOS>
You
had
charge
of
him
,
and
ought
to
know?""One
hundred
and
sixty
days
exactly
,
counting
from
the
date
of
his
arrival
to
the
hour
of
his
death
,
was
Sir
Ferdinando
an
inmate
of
the
'
Stone
Coffin
,
'
"
said
the
jailer
,
slowly
and
sententiously
;
"
and
he
appeared
to
enjoy
his
health
quite
as
well
as
could
be
expected
—
at
all
events
,
he
did
so
at
first
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
it
was
quite
so
damp
in
his
days
—
but
there
could
n't
be
much
difference
.
<EOS>
In
any
case
,
the
worthy
knight
made
no
complaints
;
perhaps
because
he
thought
there
would
be
no
use
in
making
'em
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
worshipful
Sir
,
"
he
added
to
Sir
Jocelyn
,
in
a
tone
of
affected
sympathy
which
only
made
his
mockery
more
offensive
,
"
your
father
was
a
goodly
man
,
of
quite
as
noble
a
presence
as
yourself
,
though
rather
stouter
and
broader
in
the
shoulders
,
when
he
first
came
here
;
but
he
was
sadly
broken
down
at
the
last
—
quite
a
skeleton
.
<EOS>
You
would
hardly
have
known
him
.
<EOS>
""He
lost
the
use
of
his
limbs
,
if
I
remember
right
,
Grimbald
?
"
remarked
Sir
Giles
,
willing
to
prolong
the
scene
,
which
appeared
to
afford
him
infinite
amusement
.
<EOS>
"Entirely
<EOS>
lost
the
use
of
'
em
,
"
replied
the
jailer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
what
of
that
?
<EOS>
He
did
n't
require
to
take
exercise
.
<EOS>
A
friend
was
permitted
to
visit
him
,
and
that
was
more
grace
than
the
Council
usually
allows
to
such
offenders
.
<EOS>
""It
was
far
more
than
an
offender
like
Sir
Ferdinando
deserved
,
"
said
Sir
Giles
;
"
and
,
if
I
had
known
it
,
he
should
have
had
no
such
indulgence
.
<EOS>
Star
-
Chamber
delinquents
can
not
expect
to
be
treated
like
ordinary
prisoners
.
<EOS>
If
they
do
,
they
will
be
undeceived
when
brought
here
—
eh
,
Master
<EOS>
Tunstall?""Most
true
,
Sir
Giles
,
most
true
!
"
replied
the
deputy
-
warden
.
"
<EOS>
Star
-
Chamber
prisoners
will
get
little
indulgence
from
me
,
I
warrant
them
.
<EOS>
""Unless
they
bribe
you
well
—
eh
,
Master
Joachim
?
"
<EOS>
whispered
Sir
Giles
,
merrily
.
<EOS>
"Rest
<EOS>
easy
on
that
score
,
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
I
am
incorruptible
,
unless
you
allow
it
,
"
rejoined
the
other
,
obsequiously
.
<EOS>
"My
poor
father
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Sir
Jocelyn
.
"
<EOS>
And
thou
wert
condemned
without
a
crime
to
a
death
of
lingering
agony
within
this
horrible
cell
!
<EOS>
The
bare
idea
of
it
is
madness
.
<EOS>
But
Heaven
,
though
its
judgments
be
slow
,
will
yet
avenge
thee
upon
thy
murderers!""Take
heed
what
you
say
,
prisoner
,
"
observed
Grimbald
,
changing
his
manner
,
and
speaking
with
great
harshness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Every
word
you
utter
against
the
decrees
of
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
will
be
reported
to
the
Council
,
and
will
be
brought
up
against
you
;
so
you
had
best
be
cautious
.
<EOS>
Tour
father
was
not
murdered
.
<EOS>
He
was
immured
in
this
cell
in
pursuance
of
a
sentence
of
the
High
Court
,
and
he
died
before
his
term
of
captivity
had
expired
,
that
is
all
.
<EOS>
""O
,
the
days
and
nights
of
anguish
and
despair
he
must
have
endured
during
that
long
captivity
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Sir
Jocelyn
,
before
whose
gaze
a
vision
of
his
dying
father
seemed
to
pass
,
filling
him
with
unutterable
horror
.
<EOS>
"Days
and
nights
which
will
henceforth
be
your
own
,
"
roared
Sir
Giles
;
"
and
you
will
then
comprehend
the
nature
of
your
father
's
feelings
.
<EOS>
But
he
escaped
what
you
will
not
escape
—
exposure
on
the
pillory
,
branding
on
the
cheek
,
loss
of
ears
,
slitting
of
the
nose
,
and
it
may
be
,
scourging
.
<EOS>
The
goodly
appearance
you
have
inherited
from
your
sire
will
not
be
long
left
when
the
tormentor
takes
you
in
hand
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha!""One
censured
by
the
Star
-
Chamber
must
wear
a
paper
on
his
breast
at
the
pillory
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
forget
that
mark
of
infamy
,
Sir
Giles
,
"
said
the
deputy
-
warden
,
chuckling
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
,
no
<EOS>
;
I
forget
it
not
,
"
laughed
the
extortioner
.
<EOS>
"
How
ingeniously
devised
are
our
Star
-
Chamber
punishments
,
Master
Joachim
,
and
how
well
they
meet
the
offences
.
<EOS>
Infamous
libellers
and
slanderers
of
the
State
,
like
Sir
Jocelyn
,
are
ever
punished
in
one
way
;
but
new
crimes
require
new
manner
of
punishment
.
<EOS>
You
recollect
the
case
of
Traske
,
who
practised
Judaism
,
and
forbade
the
use
of
swine
's
flesh
,
and
who
was
sentenced
to
be
fed
upon
nothing
but
pork
during
his
confinement
.
<EOS>
""I
recollect
it
perfectly
,
"
cried
Tunstall
,
"
a
just
judgment
.
<EOS>
The
wretch
abhorred
the
food
,
and
would
have
starved
himself
rather
than
take
it
;
but
we
forced
the
greasy
morsels
down
his
throat
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
You
are
merry
,
Sir
Giles
,
very
merry
;
I
have
not
seen
you
so
gleesome
this
many
a
day
—
scarcely
since
the
time
when
Clement
Lanyere
underwent
his
sentence
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
the
accursed
traitor
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Sir
Giles
,
with
an
explosion
of
rage
.
"
<EOS>
Would
he
had
to
go
through
it
again
!
<EOS>
If
I
catch
him
,
he
shall
—
and
I
am
sure
to
lay
hands
upon
him
soon
.
<EOS>
But
to
our
present
prisoner
.
<EOS>
You
will
treat
him
in
all
respects
as
his
father
was
treated
,
Master
Joachim
—
but
no
one
must
come
nigh
him
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
one
shall
approach
him
save
with
an
order
from
the
Council
,
Sir
Giles
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
even
then
,
"
said
the
extortioner
decisively
.
<EOS>
"
My
orders
alone
must
be
attended
to!""Hum
!
<EOS>
"
ejaculated
the
deputy
-
warden
,
somewhat
perplexed
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
will
follow
out
your
instructions
as
strictly
as
I
can
,
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
the
prisoner
,
and
Grimbald
may
as
well
lock
him
up
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
,
receiving
a
nod
of
assent
from
the
other
,
he
called
to
the
jailer
to
finish
his
task
.
<EOS>
But
Sir
Jocelyn
resolutely
refused
to
enter
the
cell
,
and
demanded
a
room
in
one
of
the
upper
wards
.
<EOS>
"You
shall
have
no
other
chamber
than
this
,
"
said
Sir
Giles
,
in
a
peremptory
tone
.
<EOS>
"I
did
not
address
myself
to
you
,
Sir
,
but
to
the
deputy
-
warden
,
"
rejoined
Sir
Jocelyn
.
"
<EOS>
Master
Joachim
Tunstall
<EOS>
,
you
well
know
I
am
not
sentenced
by
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
or
any
other
court
,
to
confinement
within
this
cell
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
enter
it
;
and
I
order
you
,
at
your
peril
,
to
provide
me
with
a
better
chamber
.
<EOS>
This
is
wholly
unfit
for
occupation
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
argue
the
point
,
Grimbald
,
but
force
him
into
the
cell
,
"
roared
the
extortioner
.
<EOS>
"Fair
<EOS>
and
softly
,
Sir
Giles
,
fair
and
softly
,
"
replied
the
jailer
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
prisoner
,
you
hear
what
is
said
—
are
you
prepared
to
obey?"And
<EOS>
he
was
about
to
lay
hands
rudely
upon
Sir
Jocelyn
,
when
the
latter
,
pushing
him
aside
,
ran
nimbly
up
the
steps
,
and
seizing
Sir
Giles
by
the
throat
,
dragged
him
downward
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
resistance
of
the
extortioner
,
whose
efforts
at
liberation
were
seconded
by
Grimbald
,
our
young
knight
succeeded
in
forcing
his
enemy
into
the
dungeon
,
and
hurled
him
to
the
further
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
During
the
struggle
,
Sir
Jocelyn
had
managed
to
possess
himself
of
the
other
's
sword
,
and
he
now
pointed
it
at
his
breast
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
have
constituted
yourself
my
jailer
,
"
he
cried
,
"
and
by
the
soul
of
him
who
perished
in
this
loathsome
cell
,
by
your
instrumentality
,
I
will
send
you
instantly
to
account
for
your
crimes
on
High
,
unless
you
promise
to
assign
me
a
different
chamber!""I
promise
it

"
replied
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
the
best
in
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
Let
me
go
forth
,
and
you
shall
choose
one
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
trust
you
,
false
villain
,
"
cried
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
"
Give
orders
to
the
deputy
-
warden
,
and
if
he
pledges
his
word
they
shall
be
obeyed
,
I
will
take
it
.
<EOS>
Otherwise
you
die
.
<EOS>
""Bid
<EOS>
Master
Tunstall
come
to
me

Grimbald

"
gasped
the
extortioner
.
<EOS>
"I
am
here
,
Sir
Giles
,
I
am
here
,
"
replied
the
deputy
-
warden
,
cautiously
entering
the
cell
.
<EOS>
"
What
would
you
have
me
do?""Free
me
from
this
restraint
,
"
cried
Sir
Giles
,
struggling
to
regain
his
feet
.
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
shortened
his
sword
in
order
to
give
him
a
mortal
thrust
,
but
his
purpose
was
prevented
by
Grimbald
.
<EOS>
With
his
heavy
bunch
of
keys
the
jailer
struck
the
young
knight
upon
the
head
,
and
stretched
him
insensible
upon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXVI.A
Secret
Friend
.
<EOS>
When
Sir
Jocelyn
again
became
conscious
,
he
found
he
had
been
transported
to
a
different
cell
,
which
,
in
comparison
with
the
"
Stone
Coffin
,
"
was
clean
and
comfortable
.
<EOS>
The
walls
were
of
stone
,
and
the
pallet
on
which
he
was
laid
was
of
straw
,
but
the
place
was
dry
,
and
free
from
the
noisome
effluvium
pervading
the
lower
dungeon
.
<EOS>
The
consideration
shown
him
originated
in
the
conviction
on
the
part
of
the
deputy
-
warden
,
that
the
young
man
must
die
if
left
in
his
wounded
state
in
that
unwholesome
vault
,
and
so
the
removal
took
place
,
in
spite
of
the
objections
raised
to
it
by
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
,
who
would
have
willingly
let
him
perish
.
<EOS>
But
Master
Tunstall
dreaded
an
inquiry
,
as
the
prisoner
had
not
yet
been
sentenced
by
the
Council
.
<EOS>
After
glancing
round
his
cell
,
and
endeavouring
recal
the
events
that
had
conducted
him
to
it
,
Sir
Jocelyn
tried
to
raise
himself
,
but
found
his
limbs
so
stiff
that
he
could
not
accomplish
his
object
,
and
he
sank
back
with
a
groan
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
the
door
opened
,
and
Grimbald
,
accompanied
by
a
repulsive
-
looking
personage
,
with
a
face
like
a
grinning
mask
,
advanced
towards
the
pallet
.
<EOS>
"This
is
the
wounded
man
,
Master
Luke
Hatton
,
"
said
the
jailer
;
"
you
will
exert
your
best
skill
to
cure
him
;
and
you
must
use
dispatch
,
in
case
he
should
be
summoned
before
the
Council
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
Council
must
come
to
him
if
they
desire
to
interrogate
him
now
,
"
replied
Luke
Hatton
;
adding
,
after
he
had
examined
the
injuries
received
by
the
young
knight
,
"
He
is
badly
hurt
,
but
not
so
severely
as
I
expected
.
<EOS>
I
will
undertake
to
set
him
upon
his
legs
in
three
days
.
<EOS>
I
did
as
much
for
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
,
and
he
was
wounded
in
the
same
manner
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
,
this
is
the
young
knight
who
struck
down
Sir
Giles
at
the
jousts
,
"
said
Grimbald
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Strange
!
<EOS>
you
should
have
two
mortal
enemies
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
this
Sir
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
?
"
inquired
Luke
Hatton
,
with
apparent
curiosity
.
<EOS>
"
You
did
not
tell
me
so
before
.
<EOS>
""Perhaps
I
ought
not
to
have
told
you
so
now
,
"
returned
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
But
do
you
take
any
interest
in
him?""Not
much
,
"
replied
the
apothecary
;
"
but
I
have
heard
his
name
often
mentioned
of
late
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
be
uneasy
about
this
young
man
being
summoned
before
the
Star
-
Chamber
.
<EOS>
The
great
case
of
the
Countess
of
Exeter
against
Lady
Lake
comes
on
before
the
King
and
the
Lords
of
the
Council
to
-
morrow
or
next
day
,
and
it
will
occupy
all
their
attention
.
<EOS>
They
will
have
no
time
for
aught
else
.
<EOS>
""What
think
you
will
be
the
judgment
in
that
case
?
"
inquired
Grimbald
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
my
own
opinion
,
"
returned
the
apothecary
,
with
a
significant
smile
;
"
but
I
care
not
to
reveal
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
witness
in
the
case
myself
,
and
something
may
depend
on
my
evidence
.
<EOS>
You
asked
me
just
now
whether
I
took
any
interest
in
this
young
man
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
what
surprised
me
to
find
him
here
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
has
taken
it
into
his
head
to
rob
him
of
his
intended
bride
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
jailer
,
with
a
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
The
old
dotard
does
not
mean
to
marry
her?""By
my
troth
<EOS>
but
he
does
—
<EOS>
and
the
wedding
is
to
be
a
grand
one
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
more
about
it
anon
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
moment
Sir
Jocelyn
,
who
had
hitherto
remained
with
his
eyes
closed
,
uttered
a
cry
of
anguish
,
and
again
vainly
endeavoured
to
raise
himself
.
<EOS>
"Aveline
<EOS>
married
to
Sir
Francis
?
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Said
you
she
was
to
be
forced
into
a
union
with
that
hoary
miscreant
?
<EOS>
It
must
be
prevented
.
<EOS>
""I
see
not
how
it
can
be
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
"
replied
Luke
Hatton
,
"
since
she
is
in
the
power
of
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
Besides
which
,
the
'
hoary
miscreant
,
'
as
you
style
him
,
will
take
means
to
ensure
her
acquiescence
.
<EOS>
""Means
!
<EOS>
what
means
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Sir
Jocelyn
,
writhing
in
agony
.
<EOS>
"A
love
-
potion
,
"
replied
Luke
Hatton
,
calmly
,
"
I
am
about
to
prepare
a
philter
for
her
,
and
will
answer
for
its
effect
.
<EOS>
She
will
be
the
old
knight
's
,
and
without
opposition
.
<EOS>
""Infernal
<EOS>
villain
!
<EOS>
and
that
I
should
be
lying
here
,
unable
to
give
her
aid!"And
overcome
by
the
intensity
of
his
emotion
,
as
well
as
by
acute
bodily
suffering
,
Sir
Jocelyn
relapsed
into
insensibility
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
,
however
,
suffered
to
remain
long
in
this
state
.
<EOS>
Stimulants
applied
by
Luke
Hatton
soon
restored
him
to
consciousness
.
<EOS>
The
first
object
his
gaze
fell
upon
was
the
apothecary
,
and
he
was
about
to
vent
his
fury
upon
him
in
words
,
when
the
latter
,
cautiously
raising
his
finger
to
his
lips
,
said
in
a
whisper—"I
am
a
friend
.
<EOS>
Grimbald
is
only
at
the
door
,
and
a
single
exclamation
on
your
part
will
betray
me
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
leaned
down
,
and
bringing
his
lips
almost
close
to
the
young
knight
's
ear
,
whispered—"What
<EOS>
I
said
before
the
jailer
was
correct
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
applied
to
by
Sir
Francis
for
a
philter
to
be
administered
to
Mistress
Aveline
,
and
I
have
promised
it
to
him
;
but
I
am
secretly
in
the
service
of
Clement
Lanyere
,
and
will
defeat
the
old
usurer
's
villainous
designs
.
<EOS>
"Sir
<EOS>
Jocelyn
could
not
repress
a
cry
of
delight
,
and
Grimbald
entered
the
cell
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXVII.Showing
<EOS>
how
judgment
was
given
by
King
Jamesin
the
Star
Chamber
,
in
the
great
cause
of
theCountess
of
Exeter
against
Sir
Thomas
and
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
Five
days
had
King
James
and
the
whole
of
the
Privy
Council
been
sitting
within
the
Star
-
Chamber
;
and
the
great
cause
that
had
occupied
them
during
the
whole
of
that
time
was
drawing
to
an
end
—
little
remaining
for
his
Majesty
to
do
in
it
,
except
to
pronounce
sentence
.
<EOS>
The
cause
to
which
James
and
his
Councillors
had
lent
a
hearing
so
long
and
patient
,
was
no
other
than
that
of
the
Countess
of
Exeter
against
Sir
Thomas
Lake
and
his
Lady
.
<EOS>
Throughout
it
,
whether
prompted
or
not
as
to
the
course
he
pursued
,
the
Monarch
displayed
great
sagacity
and
penetration
.
<EOS>
Prior
to
the
trial
,
and
when
the
preliminary
statements
had
alone
been
laid
before
him
,
he
determined
personally
to
investigate
the
matter
,
and
without
acquainting
any
one
with
his
design
,
while
out
hunting
,
he
rode
over
to
the
Earl
of
Exeter
's
residence
at
Wimbledon
—
the
place
,
it
will
be
recollected
,
where
the
forged
confession
was
alleged
to
have
been
signed
by
the
Countess
—
and
proceeded
to
examine
the
particular
chamber
indicated
by
Lady
Lake
and
Sarah
Swarton
as
the
scene
of
the
transaction
.
<EOS>
He
was
accompanied
by
Buckingham
,
and
some
other
lords
high
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
On
examination
it
was
found
that
the
chamber
was
of
such
size
,
and
the
lower
part
of
it
,
where
Sarah
was
reported
to
have
been
concealed
,
was
so
distant
from
the
large
bay
window
,
that
any
conversation
held
there
must
have
been
inaudible
to
her
;
as
was
proved
,
upon
experiment
,
by
the
King
and
his
attendants
.
<EOS>
But
the
crowning
circumstance
was
the
discovery
made
by
James
himself
—
for
his
courtiers
were
too
discreet
to
claim
any
share
in
it
—
that
the
hangings
did
not
reach
within
two
feet
of
the
floor
,
and
consequently
could
not
have
screened
a
secret
witness
from
view
;
while
it
was
further
ascertained
that
the
arras
had
been
entirely
undisturbed
for
several
years
.
<EOS>
On
making
this
discovery
,
James
rubbed
his
hands
with
great
glee
,
and
exclaimed—"Aha
!
<EOS>
my
Lady
Lake
and
her
handmaiden
may
forswear
themselves
if
they
choose
—
but
they
will
not
convince
me
.
<EOS>
Oaths
can
not
confound
my
sight
.
<EOS>
"This
asseveration
he
repeated
during
the
trial
,
at
which
he
proffered
his
own
testimony
in
favour
of
the
plaintiff
;
and
indeed
it
was
evident
from
the
first
,
however
much
he
might
seek
to
disguise
it
,
that
he
was
strongly
biassed
towards
the
Countess
.
<EOS>
Not
content
,
however
,
with
the
discovery
he
had
made
at
Wimbledon
,
James
had
secretly
despatched
a
serjeant
-
at
-
arms
to
Rome
,
where
Lord
Roos
had
taken
up
his
residence
after
leaving
England
,
and
obtained
from
him
and
from
his
confidential
servant
Diego
,
a
statement
incriminating
Lady
Lake
,
and
denouncing
the
confession
as
a
wicked
forgery
.
<EOS>
Luke
Hatton
,
moreover
,
who
had
gone
over
,
as
already
intimated
,
to
the
side
of
the
Countess
,
and
who
took
care
to
hide
his
own
complicity
in
the
dark
affair
,
and
to
give
a
very
different
colour
to
his
conduct
from
what
really
belonged
to
it
—
Luke
Hatton
,
we
say
,
became
a
most
important
witness
against
the
Lakes
,
and
it
was
said
to
be
owing
to
his
crafty
insinuations
that
the
King
conceived
the
idea
of
visiting
Wimbledon
as
before
-
mentioned
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
this
,
there
were
many
irreconcileable
contradictions
,
and
the
notoriously
bad
character
of
Lord
Roos
,
his
cruel
treatment
of
his
wife
,
and
his
passionate
devotion
to
the
Countess
,
led
many
to
suspect
that
,
after
all
,
he
and
Lady
Exeter
were
the
guilty
parties
they
were
represented
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
by
such
as
had
any
knowledge
of
the
man
,
Luke
Hatton
was
not
esteemed
a
credible
witness
;
and
it
was
generally
thought
that
his
testimony
ought
not
to
be
received
by
the
King
,
or
accepted
only
with
the
greatest
caution
.
<EOS>
But
the
opinions
favourable
to
Lady
Lake
and
her
husband
underwent
an
entire
change
in
the
early
part
of
the
trial
,
when
,
to
the
surprise
of
all
,
and
to
the
inexpressible
dismay
of
her
parents
,
Lady
Roos
,
who
had
been
included
in
the
process
by
the
Countess
,
made
a
confession
,
wherein
she
admitted
that
the
document
produced
by
her
mother
against
Lady
Exeter
,
was
fabricated
,
and
that
all
the
circumstances
said
to
be
connected
with
it
at
the
time
of
its
supposed
signature
,
were
groundless
and
imaginary
.
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
lady
's
motive
for
making
this
revelation
was
the
desire
of
screening
her
husband
;
and
so
infatuated
<EOS>
was
she
by
her
love
of
him
,
that
she
allowed
herself
to
be
persuaded
—
by
the
artful
suggestions
,
it
was
whispered
,
of
Luke
Hatton
—
that
this
would
be
the
means
of
accomplishing
their
reconciliation
,
and
that
she
would
be
rewarded
for
her
devotion
by
his
returning
regard
.
<EOS>
If
such
was
her
belief
,
she
was
doomed
to
disappointment
.
<EOS>
She
never
beheld
him
again
.
<EOS>
Lord
Roos
died
abroad
soon
after
the
trial
took
place
;
nor
did
his
ill
-
fated
lady
long
survive
him
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
it
will
be
seen
,
all
circumstances
were
adverse
to
the
Lakes
.
<EOS>
But
in
spite
of
the
difficulties
surrounding
her
,
and
the
weight
of
evidence
,
true
or
false
,
brought
against
her
,
no
concession
could
be
obtained
from
Lady
Lake
,
and
she
stoutly
protested
her
innocence
,
and
retaliated
in
most
forcible
terms
upon
her
accusers
.
<EOS>
She
gave
a
flat
contradiction
to
her
daughter
,
and
poured
terrible
maledictions
on
her
head
,
ceasing
them
not
until
silenced
by
command
of
the
King
.
<EOS>
The
fearful
charges
brought
by
her
ladyship
against
Luke
Hatton
produced
some
effect
,
and
were
listened
to
;
but
,
as
they
could
only
be
substantiated
by
herself
and
Sarah
Swarton
,
they
fell
to
the
ground
;
since
here
again
Lady
Roos
refused
to
be
a
witness
against
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Unwilling
to
admit
his
wife
's
criminality
,
though
urged
by
the
King
to
do
so
in
order
to
save
himself
,
Sir
Thomas
Lake
was
unable
to
make
a
successful
defence
;
and
he
seemed
so
much
bowed
down
by
affliction
and
perplexity
,
that
sympathy
was
generally
felt
for
him
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
his
dignified
deportment
and
reserve
gave
him
some
claim
to
consideration
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
was
the
trial
brought
to
a
close
,
after
three
days
'
duration
.
<EOS>
Now
,
let
a
glance
be
cast
round
the
room
wherein
the
lords
of
the
Council
were
deliberating
upon
their
judgment
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
Star
-
Chamber
.
<EOS>
Situated
on
the
south
-
eastern
side
of
Westminster
Hall
,
near
the
river
,
this
famous
room,—wherein
the
secret
councils
of
the
kingdom
were
then
held
,
and
had
been
held
during
many
previous
reigns,—was
more
remarkable
for
the
beauty
of
its
ceiling
than
for
size
or
splendour
.
<EOS>
That
ceiling
was
of
oak
,
richly
carved
and
gilt
,
and
disposed
in
squares
,
in
the
midst
of
which
were
roses
,
portculises
,
pomegranates
,
and
fleurs
-
de
-
lys
.
<EOS>
Over
the
door
leading
to
the
chamber
was
placed
a
star
,
in
allusion
to
its
name
,
with
the
date
1602
.
<EOS>
Its
walls
were
covered
with
ancient
tapestry
,
and
it
had
many
windows
looking
towards
the
river
,
and
filled
with
painted
glass
.
<EOS>
Though
it
would
appear
to
be
obvious
enough
,
much
doubt
has
been
entertained
as
to
the
derivation
of
the
name
of
this
celebrated
Court
.
<EOS>
"
Some
think
it
so
called
,
"
writes
the
author
of
a
learned
treatise
on
its
jurisdiction
,
before
cited
,
"
of
Crimen
Stellionatus
,
because
it
handleth
such
things
and
cases
as
are
strange
and
unusual
:
some
of
Stallen
.
<EOS>
I
confess
I
am
in
that
point
a
Platonist
in
opinion
,
that
nomina
naturâ
fiunt
potiùs
quam
vagâ
impositone
.
<EOS>
And
so
I
doubt
not
<EOS>
but
Camera
-
Stellata
(
for
so
I
find
it
called
in
our
ancient
Year
-
books
)
is
most
aptly
named
;
not
because
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
where
the
Court
is
kept
,
is
so
adorned
with
stars
gilded
,
as
some
would
have
it
—
for
surely
the
chamber
is
so
adorned
because
it
is
the
seal
of
that
Court
,
et
denominatio
,
being
à
praestantiori
magis
dignum
trahit
ad
se
minus
;
and
it
was
so
fitly
called
,
because
the
stars
have
no
light
but
what
is
cast
upon
them
from
the
sun
by
reflection
,
being
his
representative
body
,
and
,
as
his
Majesty
was
pleased
to
say
when
he
sat
there
in
his
royal
person
,
representation
must
need
cease
when
the
person
is
present
.
<EOS>
So
in
the
presence
of
his
great
majesty
,
the
which
is
the
sun
of
honour
and
glory
,
the
shining
of
those
stars
is
put
out
,
they
not
having
any
power
to
pronounce
any
sentence
in
this
Court
—
for
the
judgment
is
the
King
's
only
;
but
by
way
of
advice
they
deliver
their
opinions
,
which
his
wisdom
alloweth
or
disalloweth
,
increaseth
or
moderateth
at
his
royal
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
explanation
,
which
seems
rather
given
for
the
purpose
of
paying
a
fulsome
compliment
to
James
,
in
whose
reign
the
treatise
in
question
was
written
,
is
scarcely
satisfactory
;
and
we
have
little
doubt
that
the
name
originated
in
the
circumstance
of
the
roof
of
the
chamber
being
embellished
with
gilded
stars
.
<EOS>
We
are
told
in
Strype
's
Stowe
,
that
the
Star
-
Chamber
was
"
so
called
,
either
by
derivation
from
the
old
English
word
Steoran
,
which
signifieth
to
steer
or
rule
,
as
doth
the
pilot
of
a
ship
;
because
the
King
and
Council
did
sit
here
,
as
it
were
,
at
the
stern
,
and
did
govern
in
the
ship
of
the
Commonwealth
.
<EOS>
Some
derive
in
from
Stellio
,
which
signifies
that
starry
and
subtle
beast
so
called
.
<EOS>
From
which
cometh
the
word
stellionatus
,
that
signifieth
cosenage
;
because
that
crime
was
chiefly
punishable
in
this
Court
by
an
extraordinary
power
,
as
it
was
in
the
civil
law
.
<EOS>
Or
,
because
the
roof
of
this
Court
was
garnished
with
gilded
stars
,
as
the
room
itself
was
starry
,
or
full
of
windows
and
lights
.
<EOS>
In
which
respect
some
of
the
Latin
Records
name
it
Camera
Stellata
;
the
French
Chambre
des
Ètoiles
;
and
the
English
the
Starred
Chamber
.
<EOS>
"
The
derivation
of
the
name
,
we
repeat
,
seems
to
us
sufficiently
simple
and
obvious
;
but
as
it
has
been
matter
of
controversy
,
we
have
thought
it
worth
while
to
advert
to
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
To
proceed
.
<EOS>
In
a
chair
of
state
,
elevated
above
the
table
round
which
the
Lords
of
the
Council
were
gathered
,
and
having
a
canopy
over
it
,
sat
the
King
,
calmly
watching
them
as
they
pursued
their
deliberations,—his
own
mind
being
completely
made
up
as
to
the
sentence
he
should
pronounce
—
and
ever
and
anon
stealing
a
glance
at
Lady
Lake
and
her
husband
,
who
were
seated
behind
a
bar
that
crossed
the
room
below
the
Council
-
table
.
<EOS>
The
defendants
,
or
prisoners
—
for
such
in
effect
they
were
—
were
under
the
guard
of
a
pursuivant
and
a
serjeant
-
at
-
arms
.
<EOS>
A
little
behind
them
was
Sarah
Swarton
;
but
,
though
faint
and
frightened
,
and
scarcely
able
to
sustain
herself
,
she
was
not
allowed
a
seat
.
<EOS>
On
a
raised
bench
at
the
side
sat
the
beautiful
Countess
of
Exeter
,
radiant
with
smiles
and
triumph
.
<EOS>
She
was
receiving
the
congratulations
of
several
dames
of
high
rank
by
whom
she
was
accompanied
.
<EOS>
Amongst
the
Judges
of
the
Court
were
the
Lord
Chancellor
,
who
sat
immediately
under
the
King
,
with
his
mace
and
seal
before
him
;
the
Lord
Treasurer
and
the
Keeper
of
the
Privy
Seal
;
the
President
of
the
Council
;
the
Judges
;
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
and
eight
bishops
and
other
prelates
;
and
all
the
dukes
,
marquises
,
earls
,
and
barons
composing
the
Privy
Council
,
to
the
number
of
forty
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
,
there
were
present
Prince
Charles
,
three
of
the
lieger
ambassadors
,
and
many
other
distinguished
persons
.
<EOS>
Though
all
had
gone
against
her
,
Lady
Lake
's
spirit
was
still
undiminished
,
and
she
eyed
the
Council
imperiously
;
but
her
husband
's
regards
were
fixed
upon
the
ground
,
and
his
head
rested
upon
his
breast
.
<EOS>
After
some
further
time
had
been
needlessly
consumed
by
the
Council
in
stating
their
opinions
to
the
King
,
he
prepared
to
deliver
judgment
.
<EOS>
On
this
the
defendants
arose
,
and
profound
silence
reigned
throughout
the
Court
as
James
addressed
them
.
<EOS>
The
sentence
was
to
this
effect:—A
fine
of
upwards
of
£
22,000
was
imposed
upon
Sir
Thomas
,
with
a
further
censure
of
imprisonment
in
the
Tower
,
during
the
King
's
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Lady
Lake
was
to
be
imprisoned
with
him
.
<EOS>
A
public
recognition
of
their
offence
,
for
reparation
of
the
Countess
's
injured
honour
,
was
to
be
made
by
them
,
in
the
most
ample
manner
His
Majesty
could
devise
.
<EOS>
Sarah
Swarton
was
adjudged
to
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
"
Thence
,
"
ran
the
sentence
,
"
to
be
whipped
at
the
cart
's
tail
to
Westminster
,
and
afterwards
from
the
same
place
to
Cheapside
.
<EOS>
At
Cheapside
to
be
branded
with
F.A.
(
signifying
false
accusation
)
,
one
letter
on
either
cheek
.
<EOS>
To
do
public
penance
in
Saint
Martin
's
Church
.
<EOS>
To
be
detained
in
the
Fleet
till
they
do
weary
of
her
;
and
then
to
be
sent
to
Bridewell
,
there
to
spend
and
end
her
days
.
<EOS>
"When
<EOS>
the
poor
handmaiden
heard
this
severe
sentence
<EOS>
,
she
uttered
a
cry
of
despair
,
and
fell
down
on
the
floor
in
a
swoon
.
<EOS>
Thereupon
the
delinquents
were
removed
;
and
as
Lady
Lake
withdrew
,
a
look
passed
between
her
and
the
Countess
,
which
,
in
spite
of
the
assurance
of
the
latter
,
made
her
turn
pale
,
and
tremble
.
<EOS>
In
a
very
remarkable
letter
,
subsequently
addressed
by
Lady
Lake
to
her
successful
opponent
in
this
great
case
,
she
said:—"I
wish
my
submission
could
make
you
an
innocent
woman
,
and
wash
you
as
white
as
a
swan
;
but
it
must
be
your
own
submission
unto
God
,
and
many
prayers
,
and
tears
,
and
afflictions
,
which
,
seeing
you
have
not
outwardly
,
examine
your
heart
,
and
think
on
times
past
,
and
remember
what
I
have
written
to
you
heretofore
.
<EOS>
The
same
I
do
now
again
,
for
I
yet
nothing
doubt
,
but
that
,
although
the
Lord
Roos
was
sent
away
,
and
is
dead
,
yet
truth
lives
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
truth
,
however
,
was
never
fully
brought
to
light
;
and
that
justice
which
the
vindictive
lady
expected
was
denied
her
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
<EOS>
XXVIII.The
<EOS>
Two
Warrants
.
<EOS>
At
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
,
James
was
observed
to
smile
,
and
Buckingham
,
who
had
drawn
near
the
chair
of
state
,
ventured
to
inquire
what
it
was
that
entertained
his
Majesty
.
<EOS>
"Our
<EOS>
fancy
has
been
tickled
by
a
curious
conceit
,
"
answered
the
King
.
<EOS>
"
We
discern
a
singular
similitude
between
the
case
we
hae
just
heard
,
and
the
transgression
of
our
first
parents
.
<EOS>
""How
<EOS>
so
,
your
Majesty
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
favourite
.
"As
<EOS>
thus
,
"
replied
James
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Lake
may
be
likened
to
our
gude
Father
Adam
,
wha
fell
into
sin
frae
listening
to
the
beguilements
of
Eve
—
Mither
Eve
being
represented
by
his
dochter
,
<EOS>
my
Lady
Roos
—
and
ye
will
own
that
there
can
not
be
a
closer
resemblance
to
the
wily
auld
serpent
than
we
find
in
my
Lady
Lake
.
<EOS>
""Excellent
!
"
cried
Buckingham
,
joining
in
the
royal
laughter
;
"
but
before
your
Majesty
quits
that
seat
,
I
must
entreat
you
to
perform
that
<EOS>
which
I
know
you
delight
in
—
an
act
of
justice
.
<EOS>
""Anither
<EOS>
act
of
justice
,
ye
should
say
,
my
Lord
,
"
returned
James
in
a
tone
of
slight
rebuke
;
"
seeing
we
hae
just
delivered
a
maist
memorable
judgment
in
a
case
which
has
cost
us
five
days
of
incessant
labour
and
anxious
consideration
.
<EOS>
But
what
is
it
ye
require
at
our
hands
?
<EOS>
In
whose
behalf
are
we
to
exercise
our
prerogative?""In
that
of
Sir
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
,
my
gracious
Liege
,
"
replied
Buckingham
,
"
who
has
been
committed
to
the
Fleet
for
contempt
of
this
high
and
honourable
Court
,
and
can
only
be
released
by
your
Majesty
's
warrant
.
<EOS>
As
I
was
myself
present
on
the
occasion
,
when
the
intemperate
expressions
laid
to
his
charge
were
used
,
I
can
affirm
that
he
was
goaded
on
by
his
enemies
to
utter
them
;
and
that
in
his
calmer
moments
he
must
have
regretted
his
rashness
.
<EOS>
""Ye
shall
have
the
warrant
,
my
Lord
,
"
said
James
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
And
it
does
ye
meikle
credit
to
have
made
the
request
.
<EOS>
The
punishment
Sir
Jocelyn
has
already
endured
is
amply
sufficient
for
the
offence
;
and
we
hae
nae
fears
of
its
being
repeated
.
<EOS>
A
single
visit
to
the
Fleet
is
eneuch
for
any
man
.
<EOS>
But
in
respect
to
Sir
Jocelyn
,
I
am
happy
to
say
that
his
Excellency
the
Conde
de
Gondomar
has
quite
set
him
right
in
our
gude
opinion
;
and
has
satisfactorily
proved
to
us
that
the
spy
we
suspected
him
to
be
was
anither
person
,
wha
shall
be
nameless
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
here
comes
the
Count
himself
,
"
he
exclaimed
,
as
the
Spanish
Ambassador
approached
.
"
<EOS>
Your
Excellency
will
be
glad
to
hear
,
after
the
handsome
manner
you
have
spoken
of
him
,
that
it
is
our
intention
to
restore
Sir
Jocelyn
to
the
favour
he
previously
enjoyed
.
<EOS>
My
Lord
of
Buckingham
is
to
have
a
warrant
for
his
release
from
the
Fleet
,
and
we
shall
trust
to
see
him
soon
at
Court
as
heretofore
.
<EOS>
""While
<EOS>
your
Majesty
is
in
this
gracious
mood
,
"
said
De
Gondomar
,
bending
lowly
,
"
suffer
me
to
prefer
a
request
respecting
a
person
of
very
inferior
consequence
to
Sir
Jocelyn
—
but
one
in
whom
I
nevertheless
take
an
interest
—
and
who
is
likewise
a
prisoner
in
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
ye
require
a
warrant
for
his
liberation
<EOS>
—
ah
,
Count?""Your
Majesty
has
said
it
,
"
replied
De
Gondomar
,
again
bending
lowly
.
<EOS>
"What
is
the
nature
of
his
offence
?
"
demanded
the
King
.
<EOS>
"A
<EOS>
trifling
outrage
upon
myself
,
"
returned
the
Ambassador;—"a
mere
nothing
,
your
Majesty
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
I
know
whom
you
mean
.
<EOS>
You
refer
to
that
rascally
apprentice
,
Dick
Taverner
,
"
cried
James
.
<EOS>
"
Call
ye
his
attack
upon
you
a
trifling
outrage
—
a
mere
nothing
,
Count
.
<EOS>
I
call
it
a
riot
—
almost
a
rebellion
—
to
assault
an
ambassador
.
<EOS>
""Whatever
<EOS>
it
may
be
,
I
am
content
to
overlook
it
,
"
said
De
Gondomar
;
"
and
,
in
sooth
,
the
knaves
had
received
some
provocation
.
<EOS>
""Aweel
,
since
your
Excellency
is
disposed
to
view
it
in
that
light
,
"
rejoined
James—"since
ye
display
such
generosity
towards
your
enemies
,
far
be
it
from
us
to
oppose
your
wishes
.
<EOS>
The
order
for
the
'
prentice
's
release
shall
be
made
out
at
the
same
time
as
Sir
Jocelyn
's
.
<EOS>
My
Lord
of
Buckingham
will
give
orders
to
that
effect
to
the
Clerk
of
the
Court
,
and
we
will
attach
our
sign
manual
to
the
warrants
.
<EOS>
And
now
—
have
ye
not
done
?
"
<EOS>
he
continued
,
observing
that
Buckingham
still
lingered
.
"
<EOS>
Have
ye
any
mair
requests
to
prefer?""I
had
some
request
to
make
on
the
part
of
the
Prince
,
my
Liege
,
"
replied
the
Marquis
;
"
but
his
Highness
<EOS>
,
I
perceive
,
is
about
to
speak
to
you
himself
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
said
this
,
Prince
Charles
,
who
had
occupied
a
seat
among
the
Council
,
drew
near
,
and
stepping
upon
the
elevation
on
which
the
chair
of
state
was
placed
,
so
as
to
bring
himself
on
a
level
with
his
royal
father
,
made
a
long
and
apparently
important
communication
to
him
in
a
very
low
tone
.
<EOS>
James
listened
to
what
was
said
by
his
son
with
great
attention
,
and
seemed
much
surprised
and
indignant
at
the
circumstances
,
whatever
they
were
,
related
to
him
.
<EOS>
Ever
and
anon
,
he
could
not
repress
a
great
oath
,
and
,
but
for
the
entreaties
of
Charles
,
would
have
given
vent
to
an
explosion
of
choler
,
which
must
have
betrayed
the
secret
reposed
to
his
keeping
.
<EOS>
Calming
himself
,
however
,
as
well
as
he
could
,
he
at
length
said
,
in
a
low
tone—"We
confide
the
matter
to
you
,
since
you
desire
it
,
for
we
are
assured
our
dear
son
will
act
worthily
and
well
as
our
representative
.
<EOS>
Ye
shall
be
clothed
with
our
authority
,
and
have
power
to
punish
these
heinous
offenders
as
ye
see
fit
.
<EOS>
We
will
confirm
your
judgments
,
whatever
they
be
,
and
sae
will
our
Preevy
Council
.
<EOS>
""I
must
have
power
to
pardon
,
as
well
as
to
punish
,
<EOS>
my
gracious
Liege
,
"
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
"Ye
<EOS>
shall
hae
baith
,
"
answered
the
King
;
"
but
the
distinction
is
needless
,
since
the
ane
is
comprehended
in
the
ither
.
<EOS>
Ye
shall
have
our
ain
seal
,
and
act
as
if
ye
were
<EOS>
King
yersel'—as
ye
will
be
ane
of
these
days
.
<EOS>
Will
that
content
<EOS>
ye?""Perfectly
,
"
replied
Charles
,
gratefully
kissing
his
royal
father
's
hand
.
<EOS>
And
,
descending
from
the
platform
,
he
proceeded
to
join
Buckingham
and
De
Gondomar
,
with
whom
he
held
a
brief
whispered
conference
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
two
warrants
were
made
out
,
and
received
the
royal
signature
;
after
which
James
quitted
the
Court
,
and
the
Council
broke
up
.
<EOS>
The
warrants
having
been
delivered
by
the
clerk
to
Buckingham
,
were
entrusted
by
the
latter
to
Luke
Hatton
,
who
,
it
appeared
,
was
waiting
for
them
in
the
outer
gallery
;
and
,
after
the
latter
had
received
some
directions
respecting
them
from
the
Marquis
,
he
hastened
away
.
<EOS>
As
he
passed
through
New
Palace
-
yard
,
Luke
Hatton
encountered
a
tall
man
muffled
in
a
long
black
cloak
.
<EOS>
A
few
words
were
exchanged
between
them
,
and
,
the
information
gained
by
the
individual
in
the
cloak
seemed
perfectly
satisfactory
to
him
.
<EOS>
So
he
went
his
way
,
while
Luke
Hatton
repaired
to
the
Fleet
Prison
.
<EOS>
There
he
was
at
once
admitted
to
the
ward
wherein
Sir
Jocelyn
was
confined
,
and
announced
to
him
the
glad
tidings
of
his
restoration
to
freedom
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
Sir
Jocelyn
was
perfectly
recovered
from
the
injuries
he
had
received
from
the
jailer
,
during
his
struggle
with
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
,
so
that
there
was
no
obstacle
to
his
removal
,
and
his
natural
wish
was
to
quit
the
prison
at
once
;
but
such
cogent
reasons
were
assigned
by
Luke
Hatton
for
his
remaining
there
for
another
day
,
that
he
could
not
but
acquiesce
in
them
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
when
all
the
circumstances
were
explained
to
him
,
as
they
were
,
by
the
apothecary
,
he
could
not
but
approve
of
the
plan
,
which
,
it
appeared
,
was
about
to
be
acted
upon
in
the
next
day
for
the
punishment
of
his
enemies
;
and
it
then
became
evident
why
Sir
Giles
should
not
be
made
acquainted
with
his
release
,
which
must
be
the
case
if
the
warrant
were
immediately
acted
upon
.
<EOS>
Neither
the
deputy
-
warden
nor
the
jailer
—
both
of
whom
,
as
he
knew
,
were
the
extortioner
's
creatures
—
were
to
be
informed
of
it
till
the
last
moment
.
<EOS>
Certain
disclosures
respecting
Clement
Lanyere
,
which
were
made
by
Luke
Hatton
to
the
young
knight
,
affected
him
very
deeply
,
and
plunged
him
for
a
long
time
in
painful
thought
.
<EOS>
Quitting
the
cell
of
the
more
important
prisoner
,
Luke
Hatton
proceeded
to
that
of
the
apprentice
,
whom
he
acquainted
with
his
good
fortune
,
holding
out
to
him
certain
prospects
of
future
happiness
,
which
drove
poor
Dick
nearly
distracted
.
<EOS>
At
the
suggestion
of
his
new
friend
,
the
'
prentice
wrote
a
letter
to
Gillian
Greenford
,
conjuring
her
,
by
the
love
she
bore
him
,
and
by
their
joint
hopes
of
a
speedy
union
,
implicitly
to
comply
with
the
directions
of
the
bearer
of
the
note
—
whatever
they
might
be
:
and
,
armed
with
this
,
Luke
Hatton
quitted
the
Meet
,
and
,
procuring
a
horse
,
rode
off
,
at
a
rapid
pace
,
to
Tottenham
.

CHAPTER
<EOS>
XXIXThe
Silver
Coffer
.
<EOS>
Within
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
's
vast
and
gloomy
mansion
,
it
has
been
said
there
were
certain
rooms
which
,
from
their
size
and
splendour
,
formed
a
striking
contrast
to
the
rest
of
the
habitation
.
<EOS>
Never
used,—except
on
extraordinary
occasions
,
when
their
owner
gave
a
grand
entertainment
with
some
ulterior
object,—these
apartments
,
notwithstanding
their
magnificence
,
partook
in
some
degree
of
the
chilling
and
inhospitable
character
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Even
when
brilliantly
lighted
up
,
they
wanted
warmth
and
comfort
;
and
though
the
banquets
given
within
them
were
sumptuous
and
profuse
,
and
the
wine
flowed
without
stint
,
the
guests
went
away
dissatisfied
,
and
railing
against
their
ostentatious
host
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
though
the
stone
walls
were
hung
with
rich
tapestry
,
the
dust
had
gathered
thickly
upon
its
folds
,
while
portions
of
the
rugged
masonry
were
revealed
to
view
.
<EOS>
The
furniture
was
massive
,
but
cumbrous
and
ill
-
assorted
;
and
the
gilded
ceiling
and
Venetian
mirrors
,
from
want
of
care
,
had
become
tarnished
and
dim
.
<EOS>
Such
as
they
were
,
however
,
these
apartments
were
assigned
to
Aveline
,
when
she
was
forcibly
brought
to
the
extortioner
's
habitation
,
as
before
narrated
.
<EOS>
Allowed
to
range
within
them
at
pleasure
,
she
was
kept
strictly
within
their
limits
.
<EOS>
The
doors
were
constantly
guarded
by
one
or
other
of
the
myrmidons
;
and
any
communication
with
the
external
world
was
impossible
,
because
the
windows
were
partially
grated
,
and
looked
into
a
court
-
yard
.
<EOS>
Beyond
this
,
she
was
subjected
to
no
restraint
;
and
her
own
attendants
,
Dame
Sherborne
and
old
Anthony
Rocke
,
were
suffered
to
remain
with
her
.
<EOS>
Had
it
not
been
for
her
exposure
to
the
annoyance
of
frequent
from
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
,
and
her
anxiety
about
Sir
Jocelyn
<EOS>
,
Aveline
would
not
have
found
her
confinement
so
intolerable
.
<EOS>
But
the
enamoured
old
usurer
persecuted
her
at
all
hours
,
and
she
could
never
be
free
from
the
intrusion
,
since
the
doors
could
not
be
shut
against
him
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
he
came
accompanied
by
his
partner
,
though
more
frequently
alone
,
but
ever
with
the
same
purpose,—namely
,
that
of
protesting
the
violence
of
his
passion
,
and
seeking
to
soften
her
obduracy
.
<EOS>
As
may
be
well
supposed
,
his
pleadings
,
however
urged
,
were
wholly
ineffectual
,
and
excited
no
other
feelings
,
except
those
of
detestation
,
in
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
Such
a
state
of
things
could
not
endure
for
ever
;
and
her
only
hope
was
,
that
finding
all
his
efforts
to
move
her
fruitless
,
he
would
in
time
desist
from
them
.
<EOS>
Not
that
she
was
without
other
fearful
apprehensions
,
which
were
shared
by
her
attendants
.
<EOS>
Nearly
a
fortnight
had
thus
passed
by
,
when
,
one
day
,
during
which
she
had
seen
nothing
of
her
tormentor
,
and
was
rejoicing
at
the
circumstance
,
the
repast
usually
served
at
noon
was
brought
in
by
a
fresh
serving
-
man
.
<EOS>
Something
in
this
person
's
manner
,
and
in
the
meaning
glance
he
fixed
upon
her
attracted
her
attention
;
otherwise
,
he
was
a
man
of
singularly
unprepossessing
appearance
.
<EOS>
She
addressed
a
few
words
to
him
,
but
he
made
no
reply
,
and
became
suddenly
as
reserved
as
his
predecessor
had
been
.
<EOS>
This
deportment
,
however
,
it
presently
appeared
,
was
only
assumed
.
<EOS>
While
placing
a
flask
of
wine
on
the
table
,
the
man
said
in
a
low
tone—"I
am
a
friend
of
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
Constrain
yourself
,
or
you
will
betray
me
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
is
watching
us
from
an
eyelet
-
hole
in
the
door
.
<EOS>
Drink
of
this
,
"
he
added
,
pouring
wine
into
a
goblet
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
it
medicated
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
in
a
whisper
,
regarding
him
anxiously
.
<EOS>
"It
is
supposed
to
be
so
,
"
he
answered
,
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
.
<EOS>
"
Drink
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
not
,
you
will
mar
my
project
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
well
!
<EOS>
"
he
added
,
as
she
raised
the
goblet
to
her
lips
.
<EOS>
"
A
few
words
must
explain
my
design
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
will
fancy
you
have
swallowed
a
love
-
potion
.
<EOS>
Take
care
not
to
undeceive
him
,
for
on
that
belief
rests
your
safety
.
<EOS>
When
he
presents
himself
,
as
he
will
do
shortly
,
do
not
repulse
him
as
heretofore
.
<EOS>
Smile
on
him
as
kindly
as
you
can
;
and
though
the
task
of
duping
him
may
be
difficult
and
distasteful
to
you
,
shrink
not
from
it
.
<EOS>
The
necessity
of
the
case
justifies
the
deception
.
<EOS>
If
he
presses
his
suit
,
no
longer
refuse
him
your
hand
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
do
it
,
"
murmured
Aveline
,
with
a
shudder
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
MUST
,
"
rejoined
Luke
Hatton
—
for
it
was
he—"or
incur
worse
dangers
.
<EOS>
Provoked
by
your
resistance
,
Sir
Francis
has
lost
all
patience
,
and
is
determined
to
accomplish
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
Knowing
my
skill
as
a
brewer
of
philters
,
he
has
applied
to
me
,
and
I
have
promised
him
aid
.
<EOS>
But
have
no
fear
.
<EOS>
Though
employed
by
him
,
I
am
devoted
to
you
,
and
will
effect
your
deliverance
—
ay
,
and
avenge
you
upon
your
persecutors
at
the
same
time
—
if
you
follow
my
instructions
exactly
.
<EOS>
Raise
the
goblet
to
your
lips
again
.
<EOS>
Quaff
its
contents
without
apprehension
—
they
are
perfectly
harmless
.
<EOS>
Force
smiles
to
your
features
—
give
tenderness
to
your
tones
,
and
softness
to
your
glances
—
and
all
will
be
won
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
with
a
grin
,
which
,
though
intended
to
encourage
her
,
somewhat
alarmed
Aveline
,
he
took
up
the
flask
of
wine
and
departed
.
<EOS>
As
her
singular
adviser
had
predicted
,
it
was
not
long
before
the
old
usurer
made
his
appearance
,
evidently
full
of
eagerness
to
ascertain
whether
any
change
had
been
wrought
in
her
disposition
towards
him
by
the
wonder
-
working
draught
.
<EOS>
Dissembling
her
aversion
as
well
as
she
could
,
and
assuming
looks
very
foreign
to
her
feelings
,
she
easily
succeeded
in
persuading
him
that
the
philter
had
taken
effect
,
and
that
all
obstacles
to
his
happiness
were
removed
.
<EOS>
Transported
with
rapture
,
he
fell
upon
his
knees
,
and
besought
her
to
crown
his
felicity
by
consenting
to
their
union
on
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
Bewildered
by
various
emotions
,
yet
still
managing
to
play
her
part
,
she
returned
an
answer
,
which
he
construed
into
an
affirmative
;
and
now
quite
beside
himself
with
delight
,
the
amorous
old
dotard
left
her
.
<EOS>
The
alteration
in
Aveline
's
manner
and
deportment
towards
her
persecutor
,
did
not
escape
the
notice
of
her
attendants
,
and
greatly
perplexed
them
.
<EOS>
Dame
Sherborne
ventured
to
remonstrate
with
her
,
hoping
she
could
not
be
in
earnest
;
and
old
Anthony
Rocke
bluntly
told
her
he
would
rather
see
her
in
her
grave
than
the
bride
of
such
a
hoary
reprobate
as
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
Aware
that
her
actions
were
watched
,
Aveline
thought
it
best
to
dissemble
,
even
with
her
attendants
;
and
they
were
both
convinced
she
was
either
bewitched
or
had
lost
her
senses
;
and
in
either
case
bitterly
deplored
her
fate
.
<EOS>
Nor
must
it
be
supposed
that
Aveline
herself
was
without
much
secret
misgiving
,
however
skilfully
<EOS>
and
courageously
she
might
act
her
part
.
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
Luke
Hatton
,
as
we
have
more
than
once
remarked
,
was
calculated
to
inspire
distrust
in
all
brought
in
contact
with
him
;
and
with
no
other
proofs
of
his
sincerity
except
such
as
were
furnished
by
the
circumstances
,
she
might
well
entertain
suspicion
of
him
.
<EOS>
While
professing
devotion
,
he
might
intend
to
betray
her
.
<EOS>
In
that
event
,
if
driven
to
extremity
,
she
resolved
to
liberate
herself
by
the
only
means
that
would
then
be
left
her
.
<EOS>
In
the
evening
,
Luke
Hatton
paid
her
a
second
visit
;
and
on
this
occasion
comported
himself
with
as
much
caution
as
at
first
.
<EOS>
He
applauded
her
conduct
towards
Sir
Francis
,
whom
he
stated
to
be
most
effectually
duped
,
and
counselled
her
to
persevere
in
the
same
course
;
adding
,
with
his
customary
sardonic
grin
,
that
grand
preparations
were
making
for
the
wedding
-
feast
,
but
he
thought
the
cook
's
labours
likely
to
be
thrown
away
.
<EOS>
Next
day
,
Aveline
found
all
her
counsellor
had
told
her
was
correct
.
<EOS>
Several
of
the
rooms
,
hitherto
thrown
open
to
her
—
in
especial
the
great
banquetting
-
chamber
—
were
now
closed
;
and
it
was
evident
from
the
sounds
that
reached
her
ear
—
footsteps
hurrying
to
and
fro
,
loud
impatient
voices
,
and
noises
occasioned
by
the
removal
of
furniture
,
and
the
placing
of
chairs
and
tables
,
together
with
the
clatter
of
plates
and
dishes
—
that
preparations
for
a
festival
were
going
on
actively
within
them
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
equal
the
consternation
and
distress
exhibited
by
Dame
Sherborne
and
old
Anthony
Rocke
;
but
,
faithful
to
her
scheme
,
Aveline
(
however
she
desired
it
)
did
not
relieve
their
anxiety
.
<EOS>
At
noon
,
Luke
Hatton
came
again
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
in
great
glee
;
and
informed
her
that
all
was
going
on
as
well
as
could
be
desired
.
<EOS>
He
counselled
her
to
make
two
requests
of
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
First
,
that
he
should
endow
her
with
ten
thousand
marks
,
to
be
delivered
to
her
before
the
nuptials
;
secondly
,
that
she
should
be
permitted
to
shroud
her
features
and
person
in
a
veil
during
the
marriage
ceremony
.
<EOS>
Without
inquiring
the
meaning
of
these
requests
,
which
,
indeed
,
she
partly
conjectured
,
Aveline
promised
ready
compliance
;
and
her
adviser
left
her
,
but
not
till
he
had
once
more
proffered
her
the
supposed
philter
,
and
caused
her
to
place
the
cup
containing
it
to
her
lips
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
he
was
succeeded
by
Sir
Francis
,
arrayed
like
a
bridegroom
,
in
doublet
and
hose
of
white
satin
,
thickly
laid
with
silver
lace
,
and
a
short
French
mantle
of
sky
-
blue
velvet
,
branched
with
silver
flowers
,
white
roses
in
his
shoes
,
and
drooping
white
plumes
,
arranged
à
l'Espagnolle
,
in
his
hat
.
<EOS>
Besides
this
,
he
was
trimmed
,
curled
,
oiled
,
and
would
have
got
himself
ground
young
again
,
had
such
a
process
been
practicable
.
<EOS>
But
though
he
could
not
effect
this
,
he
did
the
next
thing
to
it
,
and
employed
all
the
restoratives
suggested
by
Luke
Hatton
.
<EOS>
He
bathed
in
milk
,
breakfasted
on
snail
-
broth
,
and
swallowed
a
strange
potion
prepared
for
him
by
the
apothecary
,
which
the
latter
affirmed
would
make
a
new
man
of
him
and
renovate
all
his
youthful
ardour
.
<EOS>
It
certainly
had
produced
an
extraordinary
effect
;
and
when
he
presented
himself
before
Aveline
,
his
gestures
were
so
extravagant
,
and
his
looks
so
wild
and
unpleasant
,
that
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
she
repressed
a
scream
.
<EOS>
His
cheeks
were
flushed
,
as
if
with
fever
,
and
his
eyes
dilated
and
burning
with
unnatural
lustre
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
almost
incoherently
,
tossing
his
arms
about
,
and
performing
the
antics
of
a
madman
.
<EOS>
The
philter
;
it
was
clear
,
had
been
given
him
,
and
he
was
now
under
its
influence
.
<EOS>
Amid
all
this
strange
frenzy
,
so
alarming
to
Aveline
,
he
dwelt
upon
nothing
but
his
inextinguishable
passion
,
and
never
for
a
moment
withdrew
his
fevered
gaze
from
her
.
<EOS>
He
told
her
he
would
be
her
slave
for
life
,
proud
to
wear
her
chains
;
and
that
she
should
be
absolute
mistress
of
his
house
and
all
his
possessions
.
<EOS>
On
this
she
mustered
up
resolution
to
prefer
the
requests
she
had
been
counselled
to
make
;
and
Sir
Francis
,
who
was
in
no
mood
to
refuse
her
anything
,
at
once
acceded
to
them
.
<EOS>
He
laughed
at
the
notion
of
the
veil
—
said
it
was
a
delicate
fancy
,
and
quite
charmed
him
—
but
as
to
the
ten
thousand
marks
,
they
were
utterly
unworthy
of
her
acceptance
,
and
she
should
have
thrice
the
amount
delivered
to
her
in
a
silver
coffer
before
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
With
these
,
and
a
great
many
other
professions
,
he
released
her
from
his
presence
,
which
had
become
well
-
nigh
insupportable
.
<EOS>
After
a
while
,
a
magnificent
bridal
-
dress
of
white
satin
,
richly
trimmed
with
lace
,
together
with
a
thick
white
veil
of
the
largest
size
,
calculated
to
envelope
her
whole
person
,
were
brought
her
by
a
young
damsel
,
who
told
her
she
was
engaged
to
serve
her
as
tire
-
woman
;
adding
,
that
"
she
hoped
she
would
be
able
to
satisfy
her
ladyship
,
as
she
had
already
served
the
Countess
of
Exeter
in
that
capacity
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
do
you
call
me
'
ladyship
'
child
?
"
said
Aveline
,
without
looking
at
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
right
to
any
such
title
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
you
soon
will
have
,
"
replied
the
young
tire
-
woman
;
"
as
the
bride
of
Sir
Francis
<EOS>
,
you
must
needs
be
my
Lady
Mitchell
.
<EOS>
"Checking
<EOS>
the
rejoinder
that
rose
to
her
lips
<EOS>
,
Aveline
cast
her
eyes
,
for
the
first
time
,
on
the
speaker
;
and
then
,
to
her
great
surprise
,
perceived
it
to
be
her
village
acquaintance
,
Gillian
Greenford
.
<EOS>
A
significant
glance
from
the
blue
eyes
of
the
pretty
damsel
impressed
her
with
the
necessity
of
caution
,
and
seemed
to
intimate
that
Gillian
herself
was
likewise
in
the
plot
.
<EOS>
And
so
it
presently
appeared
she
was
;
for
when
the
damsel
had
an
opportunity
of
talking
quite
in
private
to
her
new
mistress
,
she
informed
her
of
the
real
motive
of
her
coming
there
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
am
engaged
,
by
one
who
wishes
you
well
,
to
take
your
place
,
sweet
Mistress
Aveline
,
and
to
be
married
in
your
stead
to
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
have
you
really
consented
to
such
an
arrangement
?
"
rejoined
Aveline
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
possible
<EOS>
you
can
sacrifice
yourself
thus?""I
am
not
to
be
sacrificed
,
"
returned
the
damsel
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
If
it
were
so
,
I
would
never
have
agreed
to
the
scheme
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
told
I
shall
get
a
fortune
,
and—""Oh
,
<EOS>
then
the
ten
thousand
marks
are
for
you
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
I
now
see
the
meaning
of
that
part
of
the
plan
.
<EOS>
But
what
else
do
you
hope
to
accomplish?""The
deliverance
of
my
unfortunate
lover
,
Dick
Taverner
,
from
the
Fleet
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
how
is
your
marrying
this
wicked
old
usurer
to
effect
your
object
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Aveline
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
save
me
by
the
proposed
stratagem
;
but
you
will
destroy
your
own
happiness
,
and
all
your
lover
's
hopes
.
<EOS>
""No
,
no
,
I
shall
not
,
"
replied
Gillian
,
hastily
;
"
I
ca
n't
tell
how
it
's
to
be
managed
,
but
I
am
quite
sure
no
harm
will
happen
to
me
,
and
that
Dick
's
restoration
to
liberty
will
be
the
reward
of
the
service
—
if
such
it
may
be
called
—
that
I
am
about
to
render
you
.
<EOS>
He
wrote
to
me
so
himself
.
<EOS>
""At
least
,
tell
me
by
whom
you
are
engaged
,
and
I
can
then
judge
of
the
probability
of
the
rest
happening
in
the
way
you
anticipate?""Do
<EOS>
not
question
me
further
,
sweet
mistress
,
"
replied
the
damsel
,
"
for
I
am
bound
to
secrecy
.
<EOS>
But
thus
much
I
may
declare
—
I
am
the
agent
of
one
,
who
,
for
some
purposes
of
his
own
—
be
they
what
they
may
—
is
determined
to
counteract
all
Sir
Francis
's
vile
machinations
against
you
,
as
well
as
those
of
his
partner
,
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
,
against
your
lover
,
Sir
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
understand
me
now
<EOS>
,
I
perceive
,
sweet
mistress
!
<EOS>
You
have
been
guarded
by
this
unseen
but
watchful
friend
,
during
the
whole
of
your
confinement
in
this
dreadful
habitation
;
and
he
has
kept
an
equal
watch
over
your
lover
in
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
""What
!
<EOS>
Is
Sir
Jocelyn
a
prisoner
in
the
Fleet
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Aveline
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
it
not!""He
is
;
but
the
period
of
his
deliverance
approaches
,
"
replied
Gillian
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
secret
friend
I
spoke
of
has
bided
his
time
,
and
the
hour
is
at
hand
when
full
measure
of
revenge
will
be
dealt
upon
those
two
wicked
oppressors
.
<EOS>
He
has
long
worked
towards
it
;
and
I
myself
,
am
to
be
an
humble
instrument
towards
the
great
end
.
<EOS>
""You
astonish
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Aveline
,
greatly
surprised
at
the
change
in
the
damsel
's
manner
as
well
as
by
what
she
said
.
<EOS>
"Do
not
perplex
yourself
,
fair
mistress
,
"
pursued
Gillian
.
<EOS>
"
All
will
be
speedily
made
known
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
no
more
time
must
be
lost
,
and
we
must
each
assume
the
character
we
have
to
enact
.
<EOS>
As
I
am
to
be
the
bride
,
and
you
the
tire
-
woman
,
you
must
condescend
to
aid
me
in
putting
on
these
rich
robes
and
then
disguise
yourself
in
my
rustic
attire
.
<EOS>
We
are
both
pretty
nearly
of
a
size
,
so
there
is
little
risk
of
detection
in
that
particular
;
and
if
you
can
but
conceal
your
features
for
a
short
while
,
on
Sir
Francis
's
entrance
,
the
trick
will
never
be
discovered
.
<EOS>
All
the
rest
has
been
arranged
;
and
I
am
a
mere
puppet
in
the
hands
of
others
,
to
be
played
as
they
direct
.
<EOS>
Bless
us
!
<EOS>
how
beautiful
this
dress
is
,
to
-
be
-
sure!—what
<EOS>
satin!—and
<EOS>
what
lace
!
<EOS>
The
Countess
of
Exeter
has
just
such
another
.
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
that
her
ladyship
has
gained
her
cause
against
those
wicked
Lakes
,
who
conspired
against
her
?
<EOS>
But
what
am
I
saying
—
when
I
know
you
can
not
have
heard
of
it
!
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
it
occupied
five
days
in
the
Star
-
Chamber
;
and
Sir
Thomas
and
his
lady
are
sent
to
the
Tower
,
and
Sarah
Swarton
to
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
Poor
creature
!
<EOS>
she
is
to
be
whipped
and
branded
,
and
to
do
penance
in
Saint
Martin
's
church
.
<EOS>
Dreadful
!
<EOS>
but
I
wo
n't
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
this
dress
will
become
me
!
<EOS>
How
astounded
Dick
Taverner
would
be
,
if
he
could
only
see
me
in
it
!
<EOS>
Mayhap
<EOS>
he
will
—
there
's
no
saying
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
fair
mistress
,
may
I
crave
your
aid?"While
Gillian
was
thus
running
on
,
she
had
partially
disrobed
herself
,
and
very
soon
afterwards
was
decked
out
in
the
rich
attire
,
the
effect
of
which
upon
her
own
person
she
was
so
desirous
of
ascertaining
.
<EOS>
When
her
toilet
was
complete
,
she
could
not
help
running
up
to
a
mirror
,
and
on
seeing
the
reflection
of
her
well
-
formed
figure
now
displayed
to
unwonted
advantage
,
she
clapped
her
hands
and
cried
out
with
girlish
delight
.
<EOS>
Allowing
her
to
gratify
her
feelings
of
vanity
by
the
contemplation
of
her
pretty
person
for
a
few
minutes
,
Aveline
felt
it
necessary
to
recal
her
to
her
situation
,
and
her
own
transformation
into
the
tire
-
woman
was
speedily
effected,—Gillian
's
dress
fitting
her
exactly
.
<EOS>
The
light
-
hearted
damsel
was
quite
as
much
pleased
with
this
change
as
with
the
other
—
and
vowed
that
Aveline
looked
far
better
in
the
rustic
gown
,
than
she
herself
did
in
the
silken
attire
.
<EOS>
But
time
pressed
;
and
as
Sir
Francis
might
surprise
them
,
they
hastened
to
complete
their
arrangements
.
<EOS>
Gillian
's
comely
features
,
as
well
as
her
sumptuous
robe
,
had
to
be
obscured
by
the
envious
veil
;
and
as
it
was
thrown
over
her
,
she
could
not
help
heaving
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
Aveline
then
put
on
the
muffler
which
had
been
worn
by
the
country
damsel
,
and
their
disguises
were
complete
.
<EOS>
Not
a
minute
too
soon
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
a
tap
was
heard
at
a
door
communicating
with
the
adjoining
apartment
,
and
the
voice
of
the
old
usurer
was
heard
inquiring
whether
his
bride
was
ready
.
<EOS>
An
answer
in
the
affirmative
was
given
by
Aveline
,
and
,
with
a
throbbing
heart
and
faltering
steps
,
Gillian
prepared
to
obey
the
summons
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
thrown
open
,
and
mustering
up
all
her
resolution
,
she
passed
through
it
.
<EOS>
Both
Sir
Francis
and
his
partner
were
waiting
to
receive
her
.
<EOS>
The
latter
was
richly
attired
,
but
had
not
changed
the
sombre
hue
of
his
habiliments
,
even
for
the
anticipated
ceremonial
,
being
clad
,
as
usual
,
in
black
.
<EOS>
In
this
respect
he
offered
marked
contrast
to
the
gay
apparel
of
the
antiquated
bridegroom
,
as
well
as
by
the
calmness
of
his
deportment
and
the
stern
gravity
of
his
looks
.
<EOS>
Behind
them
stood
Luke
Hatton
,
bearing
a
heavy
silver
coffer
,
of
antique
workmanship
.
<EOS>
"What
means
this
veil
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Sir
Giles
,
gazing
suspiciously
at
Gillian
as
she
emerged
from
the
inner
room
,
followed
cautiously
by
Aveline
,
who
was
wrapped
in
the
muffler
.
<EOS>
"
Why
are
the
bride
's
features
thus
hidden?""A
mere
whim
,
Sir
Giles
—
a
pleasant
fancy
,
"
replied
the
old
usurer
.
"
<EOS>
But
she
must
have
her
way
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
indulge
her
in
everything
.
<EOS>
""You
are
wrong
,
"
rejoined
the
extortioner
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Make
her
feel
you
will
be
her
master
.
<EOS>
Bid
her
take
it
off
.
<EOS>
""On
no
account
<EOS>
whatever
,
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
won
her
by
submission
,
and
shall
I
spoil
all
at
the
last
moment
,
by
opposing
her
inclinations
?
<EOS>
Of
a
truth
not
.
<EOS>
""Who
<EOS>
is
the
maiden
with
her
?
"
demanded
Sir
Giles
,
scrutinizing
Aveline
,
with
a
keen
glance
.
<EOS>
"
Why
does
she
wear
a
muffler
?
<EOS>
Is
that
a
whim
,
likewise?""Perchance
it
is
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Sir
Francis
;
"
but
I
have
given
no
consent
to
it
.
<EOS>
She
is
only
the
tire
-
woman
.
<EOS>
""Come
,
mistress
,
unmuffle
.
<EOS>
Let
us
see
your
face
,
"
cried
Sir
Giles
,
striding
towards
the
terrified
maiden
,
who
thought
discovery
was
now
inevitable
.
<EOS>
But
Luke
Hatton
interposed
to
save
her
.
"Prevent
<EOS>
this
rudeness
,
"
he
whispered
,
plucking
Sir
Francis
's
cloak
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Prevent
it
instantly
.
<EOS>
If
her
whim
be
thwarted
,
I
will
not
answer
for
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
""Desist
<EOS>
,
Sir
Giles
—
desist
,
I
pray
you
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
old
usurer
,
in
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
bride
's
wish
that
her
attendant
be
not
interfered
with
—
and
mine
too
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
be
it
as
you
will
,
"
replied
the
extortioner
,
testily
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
would
not
permit
the
impertinence
were
I
in
your
case
.
<EOS>
The
bride
must
raise
her
veil
when
she
stands
before
the
priest
.
<EOS>
""She
<EOS>
shall
do
as
she
pleases
,
"
replied
Sir
Francis
,
gallantly
.
<EOS>
"
If
she
desires
to
hide
her
blushes
,
I
will
not
put
any
compulsion
upon
her
to
disclose
them
.
<EOS>
Come
,
fair
mistress
,
"
he
added
,
taking
the
trembling
hand
of
the
veiled
maiden
,
"
the
priest
awaits
us
in
the
further
chamber
,
where
the
ceremony
is
to
take
place
,
and
where
several
of
the
noble
and
illustrious
guests
who
have
consented
to
grace
our
nuptials
are
already
assembled
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
most
illustrious
personages
in
the
land
will
be
present
—
the
Marquis
of
Buckingham
,
and
perhaps
Prince
Charles
himself
.
<EOS>
His
Excellency
the
Spanish
Ambassador
has
promised
to
come
.
<EOS>
Let
us
on
,
then
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
ere
we
proceed
further
,
I
have
to
request
your
acceptance
of
that
silver
coffer
.
<EOS>
The
thirty
thousand
marks
within
it
constitute
your
dowry
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
Luke
Hatton
advanced
,
and
,
holding
the
coffer
towards
the
veiled
damsel
,
so
that
she
could
touch
it
,
<EOS>
said—"Place
your
hand
upon
this
silver
box
,
and
take
possession
of
it
,
fair
mistress
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
witness
that
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
has
freely
bestowed
it
,
with
its
contents
,
upon
you
.
<EOS>
It
will
remain
in
my
custody
till
you
require
me
to
deliver
it
up
to
you
.
<EOS>
"CHAPTER
<EOS>
XXX.How
<EOS>
the
Marriage
was
interrupted
.
<EOS>
After
the
presentation
of
the
silver
casket
,
as
before
described
,
the
whole
of
the
bridal
party
,
with
the
exception
of
Aveline
,
who
contrived
to
remain
behind
,
passed
on
into
the
adjoining
chamber
,
where
the
priest
was
understood
to
be
in
waiting
to
perform
the
marriage
ceremony
.
<EOS>
Apprehensive
of
the
consequences
of
the
discovery
which
must
inevitably
be
soon
made
,
Aveline
would
have
flown
back
to
her
own
room
,
but
was
deterred
,
from
the
strange
noises
and
confusion
she
heard
within
it
.
<EOS>
Uncertain
how
to
act
,
she
at
last
resolved
upon
attempting
an
escape
from
the
house
,
and
was
hurrying
forward
,
in
the
hope
of
gaining
the
corridor
unperceived
,
but
the
sound
of
voices
outside
again
drove
her
back
;
and
,
in
this
new
dilemma
,
she
had
nothing
left
but
to
take
refuge
behind
the
tapestry
covering
the
walls
,
which
being
fortunately
loose
and
hanging
upon
the
ground
,
effectually
concealed
her
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
was
she
screened
from
observation
in
this
manner
,
when
the
door
was
thrown
open
,
and
a
crowd
of
young
gallants
—
evidently
,
from
their
bearing
and
the
richness
of
their
attire
,
of
high
rank
—
entered
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
Without
exposing
herself
,
Aveline
was
enabled
,
through
the
folds
of
the
tapestry
,
to
command
a
view
of
what
was
going
forward
.
<EOS>
The
youthful
nobles
—
for
such
they
were
—
who
had
just
come
in
,
were
laughing
loudly
;
and
their
jests
were
chiefly
at
the
expense
of
the
old
usurer
,
whose
marriage
they
had
been
invited
to
attend
.
<EOS>
After
looking
round
for
a
moment
,
as
if
in
search
of
some
one
to
direct
them
whither
to
go
,
the
foremost
of
them
clapped
his
hands
,
<EOS>
whereupon
the
thick
curtains
which
,
in
lieu
of
a
door
,
guarded
the
entrance
to
the
other
room
,
were
drawn
aside
,
and
disclosed
a
group
of
persons
collected
together
within
that
chamber
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
them
were
the
bride
and
bridegroom
—
the
former
still
enveloped
in
her
veil
—
together
with
the
priest
and
his
assistant
.
<EOS>
At
this
sight
,
the
band
of
youthful
nobles
set
up
a
shout
of
laughter
,
and
rushed
tumultuously
forward
,
while
the
curtains
,
dropping
to
their
place
,
closed
upon
the
scene
.
<EOS>
Presently
the
outer
door
again
opened
,
and
this
time
to
admit
three
persons
,
all
of
whom
were
magnificently
dressed
,
and
apparently
of
yet
higher
rank
than
those
who
had
preceded
them
.
<EOS>
As
they
were
masked
,
their
features
could
not
be
discerned
;
but
they
were
all
distinguished
by
rare
personal
grace
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
,
indeed
,
was
remarkable
for
symmetry
of
figure
,
and
his
finely
-
proportioned
limbs
were
arrayed
in
habiliments
of
the
most
splendid
material
,
adorned
with
pearls
and
precious
stones
,
and
richly
embroidered
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
did
not
seem
to
hold
the
chief
place
among
them
:
that
,
by
common
consent
,
seemed
accorded
to
a
young
man
clad
in
black
velvet
,
who
,
by
the
majesty
of
his
deportment
and
the
gravity
of
his
manner
,
appeared
to
exercise
a
certain
sway
over
his
companions
,
and
to
be
treated
by
them
,
when
he
spoke
,
with
marked
respect
.
<EOS>
The
third
individual
was
habited
in
a
Spanish
-
cloak
of
murrey
-
velvet
,
lined
with
cloth
of
silver
,
branched
with
murrey
-
flowers
,
and
wore
a
chain
of
gold
,
richly
set
with
precious
stones
,
round
his
neck
,
from
which
depended
the
order
of
the
Golden
Fleece
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
the
presence
of
these
three
important
personages
that
gave
Aveline
a
feeling
of
security
,
such
as
she
had
not
experienced
since
her
forcible
detention
by
the
two
extortioners
,
and
she
almost
felt
inclined
to
throw
herself
at
the
feet
of
the
one
who
appeared
to
be
the
principal
of
them
,
and
solicit
his
protection
.
<EOS>
But
before
she
could
execute
her
half
-
formed
design
,
the
party
had
approached
the
entrance
of
the
nuptial
chamber
;
and
the
curtain
being
raised
for
their
admittance
,
excluded
them
,
the
next
moment
,
from
her
view
.
<EOS>
All
now
appearing
quiet
,
she
again
ventured
from
her
hiding
-
place
,
and
speeded
towards
the
door
communicating
with
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
But
her
departure
was
unexpectedly
interrupted
by
the
sudden
entrance
of
another
masked
personage
,
tall
in
stature
,
and
habited
entirely
in
black
;
and
in
him
she
could
not
fail
to
recognise
the
messenger
employed
by
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
to
bring
her
,
in
the
first
instance
,
to
his
habitation
.
<EOS>
Circumstances
had
subsequently
occurred
to
induce
her
to
change
her
opinion
respecting
this
mysterious
individual
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
his
appearance
at
this
juncture
would
have
caused
her
to
utter
a
cry
of
terror
,
if
she
had
not
been
reassured
by
the
timely
appearance
of
one
upon
whom
she
had
reliance
,
and
who
raised
his
finger
to
his
lips
in
token
of
silence
.
<EOS>
This
was
Luke
Hatton
,
who
,
at
the
very
moment
that
Lanyere
appeared
,
issued
from
the
chamber
where
the
marriage
ceremony
was
being
performed
.
<EOS>
"Be
not
alarmed
,
fair
maiden
,
"
said
Lanyere
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
you
are
in
no
danger
;
and
all
your
troubles
<EOS>
,
I
trust
,
are
well
-
nigh
ended
.
<EOS>
I
thought
you
were
in
the
marriage
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
Give
me
your
hand
.
<EOS>
You
must
assist
at
the
mock
ceremonial
taking
place
within
there
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
time
for
explanations
;
and
indeed
they
are
needless
,
since
all
will
be
speedily
made
clear
to
you
.
<EOS>
Divest
yourself
,
I
pray
you
,
of
this
muffler
.
<EOS>
It
is
part
of
my
plan
that
your
features
should
now
be
revealed
.
<EOS>
You
will
understand
why
,
anon
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
led
her
quickly
towards
the
entrance
of
the
inner
chamber
;
and
,
pushing
aside
the
curtain
,
advanced
a
few
steps
beyond
it
,
still
holding
her
by
the
hand
,
and
followed
by
Luke
Hatton
.
<EOS>
The
apartment
,
which
was
of
considerable
size
and
splendidly
furnished
,
was
full
of
wedding
-
guests
,
grouped
around
that
portion
of
it
which
was
railed
off
for
the
accommodation
of
those
more
immediately
connected
with
the
ceremonial
,
amongst
whom
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
was
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
Somewhat
apart
from
the
others
were
the
three
important
persons
who
had
arrived
last
;
and
the
most
exalted
among
them
was
seated
on
a
raised
chair
,
contemplating
the
scene
,
while
his
companions
stood
near
him
.
<EOS>
They
had
now
taken
off
their
masks
;
and
,
even
in
that
agitating
moment
Aveline
recognised
in
the
trio
the
Marquis
of
Buckingham
,
the
Conde
de
Gondomar
,
and
Prince
Charles
.
<EOS>
All
the
rest
of
the
company
remained
standing
;
and
some
of
the
young
nobles
formed
a
small
semicircle
behind
the
royal
chair
.
<EOS>
Lanyere
's
entrance
with
his
fair
companion
could
not
have
been
better
timed
.
<EOS>
They
arrived
at
the
particular
juncture
when
Sir
Francis
,
having
presented
the
wedding
-
ring
to
the
priest
was
in
the
act
of
receiving
it
back
from
him
,
in
order
that
it
might
be
placed
upon
the
finger
of
the
bride
;
and
the
noise
made
by
the
promoter
,
who
still
wore
his
vizard
,
drew
all
eyes
upon
him
,
and
upon
the
damsel
by
whom
he
was
accompanied
.
<EOS>
A
smile
of
intelligence
passed
between
Prince
Charles
and
Buckingham
;
and
some
remark
was
made
by
the
latter
,
to
which
the
Prince
replied
by
a
gesture
,
seeming
to
intimate
that
the
interruption
was
not
altogether
unexpected
by
him
.
<EOS>
De
Gondomar
's
looks
also
betrayed
that
he
was
likewise
in
the
secret
.
<EOS>
Others
of
the
company
laughed
as
if
in
anticipation
of
a
jest
;
but
the
majority
looked
surprised
—
but
<EOS>
none
so
much
so
as
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
As
his
eye
fell
upon
the
dark
and
ominous
figure
of
Lanyere
,
and
shifted
from
him
to
Aveline
,
he
appeared
transported
with
rage
;
and
dashing
the
ring
from
the
hand
of
the
astonished
bridegroom
(
who
,
having
his
back
toward
the
newcomers
,
was
unaware
of
what
was
going
forward
)
,
<EOS>
exclaimed—"Proceed
no
further
!
<EOS>
We
have
been
deceived
!
<EOS>
Look
there!""Where
?
<EOS>
where
?
"
cried
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
,
Sir
Giles
?
<EOS>
You
quite
terrify
me
with
your
fierce
looks
.
<EOS>
Help
me
to
pick
up
the
ring
,
and
let
the
ceremony
go
on
.
<EOS>
""It
is
well
for
you
that
it
is
not
completed
,
"
replied
Sir
Giles
,
almost
black
in
the
face
with
choler
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
not
whom
you
are
about
to
we
d
.
<EOS>
But
we
will
soon
see
.
<EOS>
Off
with
your
veil
,
minion
!
<EOS>
Off
with
it
,
I
say!""Sir
<EOS>
Giles
,
I
will
not
permit
this
liberty
,
"
cried
the
old
usurer
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
touch
her
.
<EOS>
Whom
should
it
be
but
<EOS>
my
own
dear
,
delectable
Aveline?""Look
round
,
I
say
,
and
credit
your
own
eyes
,
since
you
doubt
my
assertions
!
"
roared
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"Ten
thousand
furies
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Sir
Francis
,
as
he
complied
with
the
injunction
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
there
she
is
,
in
good
truth
,
when
I
thought
she
was
by
my
side
.
<EOS>
Whom
,
then
,
have
I
been
about
to
take
to
my
bosom?""It
matters
not
,
"
replied
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"
She
you
desired
to
we
d
is
yonder
,
and
must
take
the
other
's
place
.
<EOS>
That
is
—
but
I
forget
,
"
he
added
,
suddenly
checking
himself
,
and
lowering
his
tone
,
"
naught
can
be
done
,
except
according
to
rule
,
in
this
presence
.
<EOS>
Your
vanity
must
needs
be
gratified
by
bringing
together
all
this
courtly
company
to
witness
your
marriage
.
<EOS>
And
now
they
will
only
mock
you
.
<EOS>
""S'death
!
<EOS>
you
are
right
,
Sir
Giles
,
"
rejoined
the
old
usurer
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
become
a
mere
laughing
-
stock
to
my
guests
.
<EOS>
But
at
least
I
will
see
my
false
bride
's
features
.
<EOS>
You
hear
what
I
say
,
Madam
,
"
he
added
to
Gillian—"let
<EOS>
me
behold
your
face
without
more
ado
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
uttered
the
command
,
the
damsel
threw
off
her
veil
,
and
stood
blushing
,
half
-
smiling
and
half
-
abashed
,
before
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
Her
natural
charms
,
heightened
by
her
attire
,
and
by
the
peculiar
situation
in
which
she
was
placed
,
elicited
general
admiration
.
<EOS>
"As
I
live
,
'
tis
the
pretty
tirewoman
from
Tottenham
,
engaged
by
Luke
Hatton
to
attend
on
Aveline
,
"
cried
Sir
Francis
;
"
<EOS>
but
,
'
fore
Heaven
,
I
have
gained
by
the
exchange
.
<EOS>
I
like
her
better
than
the
other
,
and
will
go
through
with
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
Proceed
,
Sir
Priest
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
declaration
there
was
a
shout
of
laughter
from
the
assemblage
;
but
the
merriment
was
increased
,
when
Do
Gondomar
,
stepping
up
to
the
bride
,
said
,
"
I
forbid
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
She
belongs
to
me
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
my
claim
is
paramount
to
that
of
your
Excellency
,
"
cried
the
old
usurer
.
<EOS>
"I
can
not
admit
it
,
"
rejoined
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
the
damsel
decide
for
herself
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
I
will
accept
neither
,
"
said
Gillian
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dick
Taverner
is
already
master
of
my
heart
,
and
no
one
<EOS>
but
he
shall
have
my
hand
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
brought
here
to
play
a
part
,
on
the
clear
understanding
that
nothing
serious
was
to
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
nothing
serious
shall
come
of
it
,
fair
maiden
,
"
said
Prince
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
I
promise
that
on
my
princely
faith
.
<EOS>
""Then
,
indeed
,
I
am
easy
,
"
replied
Gillian
,
inclining
herself
reverentially
towards
the
royal
speaker
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
,
who
had
been
hitherto
restrained
by
the
presence
of
the
royal
guest
from
any
violent
measures
,
was
advancing
with
menacing
looks
towards
Lanyere
,
when
the
attention
of
Charles
being
directed
to
his
movements
by
Buckingham
,
the
Prince
instantly
arose
,
and
in
a
tone
of
authority
not
to
be
disputed
,
said—"Not
a
step
further
,
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
care
that
all
needful
explanations
be
given
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
your
Highness
can
not
be
aware
that
this
is
a
heinous
offender
and
traitor
,
"
rejoined
Sir
Giles
,
pointing
to
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
about
to
take
means
to
prevent
his
escape
.
<EOS>
""He
has
no
intention
of
escaping
,
"
rejoined
Charles
;
"
and
I
forbid
any
one
to
leave
this
apartment
without
my
permission
.
<EOS>
""Will
<EOS>
your
Highness
suffer
me
to
relieve
this
fair
creature
from
the
embarrassing
position
in
which
she
is
placed
,
"
said
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
youth
she
has
mentioned
,
and
to
whom
she
declares
her
affections
are
given
,
was
confined
in
the
Fleet
Prison
for
an
attack
on
me
;
but
,
on
my
representation
of
the
matter
to
the
King
,
your
father
,
his
Majesty
's
gracious
consent
was
immediately
accorded
for
his
liberation
.
<EOS>
""I
am
aware
of
it
,
Count
,
"
replied
Prince
Charles
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
your
Highness
may
not
be
aware
that
the
poor
fellow
is
without
,
"
pursued
the
Ambassador
.
<EOS>
"
Will
it
please
you
to
allow
him
to
be
brought
<EOS>
in?"The
Prince
assented
,
on
which
De
Gondomar
signed
to
Luke
Hatton
,
who
seemed
waiting
for
the
order
,
and
,
disappearing
for
a
moment
,
returned
with
the
apprentice
.
<EOS>
Though
evidently
prepared
for
the
scene
that
awaited
him
,
and
not
overburthened
with
modesty
,
Dick
Taverner
could
not
help
exhibiting
considerable
confusion
;
but
the
sight
of
his
mistress
somewhat
restored
him
,
and
he
pressed
towards
her
.
<EOS>
Sir
Francis
,
however
,
stepped
between
them
,
exclaiming—"Get
hence
,
base
varlet
<EOS>
—
she
is
my
wife
.
<EOS>
""No
such
thing
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Gillian—"the
ceremony
has
only
been
half
performed
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
married
.
<EOS>
I
am
yours
—
and
yours
only
,
dear
,
sweet
Dickon
.
<EOS>
""You
never
shall
be
his
—
you
are
mine
—
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
old
usurer—"I
implore
his
Highness
the
Prince
to
let
the
marriage
go
forward
.
<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
I
shall
not
allow
any
compulsion
to
be
placed
on
the
damsel
's
inclinations
,
"
replied
Charles
,
unable
to
repress
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
She
must
choose
for
herself
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
that
case
,
your
Highness
,
my
choice
is
soon
made
,
"
replied
Gillian
,
taking
her
lover
's
hand
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
honest
Dickon
need
not
be
under
any
alarm
at
such
part
of
the
marriage
as
has
already
taken
place
,
"
observed
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
a
mock
ceremonial
throughout
.
<EOS>
This
is
no
priest
,
but
one
of
my
Lord
of
Buckingham
's
grooms
employed
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
I
have
been
a
dupe
all
this
time
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sir
Francis
furiously
.
<EOS>
"
O
,
purblind
dolt
that
I
am!"But
he
met
with
no
commiseration
from
the
assemblage
,
who
only
laughed
at
his
rage
and
absurd
grimaces
.
"Kneel
and
thank
his
Highness
for
his
goodness
,
"
said
De
Gondomar
to
the
young
couple
;
"
and
then
,
if
he
will
give
you
leave
to
do
so
<EOS>
,
depart
at
once
.
<EOS>
Stay
not
a
moment
longer
than
you
can
help
it
in
this
house
,
or
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
""Most
<EOS>
assuredly
I
will
not
,
your
Excellency
,
"
returned
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
much
too
near
the
Fleet
to
be
agreeable
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
to
offer
my
heartfelt
thanks
to
your
Excellency
for
your
kindly
consideration
of
me
,
and
I
own
that
I
have
scarcely
deserved
it
at
your
hands
.
<EOS>
""Render
<EOS>
your
thanks
,
as
I
have
said
,
to
his
Highness
,
who
is
alone
entitled
to
them
,
good
fellow
,
"
said
the
Ambassador
.
<EOS>
"
Take
Gillian
home
to
her
grandsire
—
and
we
d
her
as
soon
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
She
will
need
no
dowry
,
"
he
added
in
a
low
<EOS>
tone—"for
<EOS>
she
is
already
provided
with
thirty
thousand
marks
.
<EOS>
""Honestly
come
by
,
I
hope
,
your
Excellency
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Dick
.
<EOS>
"Ay
<EOS>
,
ay
—
thou
suspicious
blockhead
.
<EOS>
Do
as
I
have
bidden
thee
,
and
get
hence
.
<EOS>
More
remains
to
be
done
to
which
thou
art
a
hindrance
.
<EOS>
"On
<EOS>
this
,
the
young
couple
prostrated
themselves
before
Prince
Charles
,
who
graciously
gave
his
hand
to
Gillian
to
kiss
,
and
then
motioning
them
to
rise
,
they
were
allowed
to
quit
the
room
.
<EOS>
Luke
Hatton
saw
them
safe
out
of
the
house
,
and
very
well
it
was
he
accompanied
them
,
for
they
had
many
obstacles
to
encounter
.
<EOS>
Before
quitting
them
,
the
apothecary
delivered
up
the
silver
casket
to
Dick
,
bidding
him
take
good
care
of
it
,
as
it
contained
his
intended
wife
's
dowry
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
,
who
had
with
difficulty
controlled
his
impatience
during
the
incidents
previously
described
,
advanced
towards
Prince
Charles
,
and
with
a
profound
reverence
,
said—"Will
<EOS>
it
please
your
Highness
to
terminate
this
idle
scene
,
which
,
though
apparently
amusing
to
the
company
assembled
,
<EOS>
is
by
no
means
<EOS>
so
entertaining
to
Sir
Francis
and
myself?""You
<EOS>
shall
have
your
wish
,
Sir
,
"
rejoined
Charles
in
a
stern
tone
and
with
a
freezing
look
,
that
seemed
of
ill
augury
to
the
extortioner—"It
is
my
intention
to
terminate
the
scene
.
<EOS>
Stand
forth
,
Clement
Lanyere
and
let
me
hear
what
you
have
to
declare
in
reference
to
this
man
.
<EOS>
"Hereupon
,
the
promoter
,
consigning
Aveline
to
the
care
of
a
gentleman
who
advanced
towards
her
for
the
purpose
,
and
respectfully
took
her
hand
,
stepped
forward
,
and
,
removing
his
mask
,
confronted
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXXI.Accusations
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
a
very
different
complexion
had
been
imparted
to
the
scene
.
<EOS>
The
interruption
of
the
marriage
ceremony
,
and
the
perplexities
of
the
old
usurer
,
tricked
out
of
his
intended
bride
,
and
bereft
even
of
her
substitute
,
had
afforded
abundant
amusement
to
the
company
,
who
,
so
far
from
feeling
pity
for
the
sufferer
,
seemed
vastly
to
enjoy
his
mortification
and
disappointment
.
<EOS>
But
all
laughter
died
away
,
and
every
tongue
became
suddenly
mute
,
as
Prince
Charles
,
assuming
the
severe
look
and
dignified
deportment
of
a
judge
,
commanded
Clement
Lanyere
to
stand
forward
,
and
prefer
the
charges
he
had
to
make
against
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
All
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
extortioner
and
his
accuser
;
and
though
etiquette
prevented
the
company
from
advancing
too
near
the
royal
seat
,
a
dense
semicircle
was
formed
in
front
of
it
,
in
the
midst
of
which
stood
the
two
principal
actors
in
the
drama
about
to
take
place
,
together
with
the
discomfited
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
.
<EOS>
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
was
not
without
great
misgivings
.
<EOS>
He
saw
that
his
case
was
already
prejudged
by
the
Prince
;
and
the
glance
of
inquiry
with
which
he
had
consulted
his
patron
,
the
Marquis
of
Buckingham
,
and
which
was
answered
by
a
cold
,
menacing
regard
,
convinced
him
that
little
support
was
to
be
expected
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
though
he
felt
himself
in
considerable
jeopardy
,
he
allowed
no
look
or
gesture
indicative
of
uneasiness
to
escape
him
;
and
the
courage
that
had
borne
him
through
many
a
trial
still
remained
unshaken
.
<EOS>
Not
so
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
.
<EOS>
He
also
perceived
the
perilous
position
in
which
he
and
his
partner
were
placed
,
and
his
abject
manner
showed
how
thoroughly
he
was
daunted
.
<EOS>
Look
wherever
he
would
,
he
found
no
sympathy
:
every
one
derided
his
distress
.
<EOS>
But
far
more
than
the
two
extortioners
did
their
accuser
command
attention
.
<EOS>
As
he
cast
off
his
mask
and
displayed
his
appalling
features
,
a
thrill
of
surprise
and
horror
pervaded
such
of
the
assemblage
as
had
never
seen
them
before
.
<EOS>
But
the
feeling
was
speedily
lost
in
wonder
.
<EOS>
Drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
height
,
so
that
his
lofty
figure
towered
above
those
with
whom
he
was
confronted
,
he
seemed
to
dart
lightning
glances
against
them
.
<EOS>
Even
Sir
Giles
could
not
bear
his
scathing
looks
,
and
would
have
shielded
himself
from
them
if
he
could
.
<EOS>
Though
fearful
to
behold
,
Lanyere
's
countenance
had
a
terrible
purpose
impressed
upon
it
which
none
could
mistake
.
<EOS>
The
effect
produced
by
his
appearance
upon
the
spectators
was
shared
even
by
Prince
Charles
,
and
a
few
minutes
elapsed
before
the
silence
was
broken
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
the
Prince
again
spoke:—"I
sit
here
,
"
he
said
,
"
as
the
representative
of
the
Majesty
of
England
—
clothed
with
the
authority
of
my
royal
father
,
and
prepared
to
exercise
it
,
as
he
would
do
were
he
present
in
person
.
<EOS>
But
though
this
seat
is
erected
into
a
tribunal
before
which
accusations
against
wrong
-
doers
can
be
brought
,
and
sentence
upon
them
pronounced
;
still
,
whatever
charges
are
now
made
,
and
against
whomsoever
they
may
be
preferred
,
those
charges
will
have
to
be
repeated
to
the
Lords
of
the
Council
of
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
before
whom
the
accused
will
be
taken
;
and
any
judgment
now
given
will
have
to
be
confirmed
by
that
high
and
honourable
Court
.
<EOS>
Of
late
,
the
course
of
justice
has
been
too
often
baffled
and
turned
aside
by
the
craft
and
subtlety
of
certain
powerful
and
audacious
offenders
.
<EOS>
Hence
it
has
been
the
wish
of
the
King
's
Highness
,
in
order
that
the
laws
may
no
longer
be
broken
with
impunity
,
that
certain
preliminary
inquiries
and
investigations
should
be
made
on
the
spot
itself
,
where
it
is
alleged
that
the
crimes
and
misdemeanours
have
been
committed
;
and
,
according
to
the
evidence
afforded
,
such
measures
as
may
be
deemed
fitting
taken
against
the
wrong
-
doers
.
<EOS>
All
present
have
witnessed
this
mock
ceremonial
,
and
have
laughed
at
its
conclusion
,
but
mirth
will
be
changed
to
indignation
,
when
it
is
known
that
the
intended
marriage
was
the
result
of
a
vile
conspiracy
on
the
part
of
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
and
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
,
against
a
young
,
virtuous
,
and
unprotected
maiden
,
whose
beauty
had
inflamed
the
breast
of
the
elder
,
and
it
might
have
been
expected
from
that
circumstance
,
the
wiser
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
Into
the
details
of
their
infamous
scheme
,
it
will
not
be
necessary
now
to
enter
;
and
it
may
suffice
to
say
,
that
the
devoted
attachment
of
the
damsel
to
another
was
wholly
disregarded
,
while
the
basest
means
were
employed
to
induce
her
consent
to
a
match
so
abhorrent
to
her
feelings
,
as
must
have
been
that
with
Sir
Francis
.
<EOS>
Failing
in
this
,
however
,
the
two
conspirators
went
yet
further
.
<EOS>
They
forcibly
carried
off
the
maiden
from
her
own
dwelling
,
and
detained
her
against
her
will
within
this
house
,
till
by
their
arts
they
imagined
they
had
gained
their
point
—
and
that
a
love
-
potion
would
accomplish
all
for
them
,
that
their
persuasions
and
fair
promises
were
unable
to
effect
.
<EOS>
But
the
damsel
was
guarded
from
all
ill
by
an
unseen
friend
—
and
the
weapons
of
the
conspirators
were
turned
against
themselves
.
<EOS>
You
have
witnessed
how
they
have
been
duped
,
and
,
as
no
mischief
has
resulted
from
this
infamous
endeavour
,
the
mortification
they
have
endured
may
be
taken
as
part
punishment
of
the
offence
.
<EOS>
Stand
forward
,
fair
Mistress
Aveline
Calveley
,
and
substantiate
what
I
have
just
declared
.
<EOS>
"Thus
adjured
,
the
maiden
approached
within
a
few
paces
of
the
Prince
,
and
having
made
a
lowly
salutation
,
said,—"All
that
your
Highness
has
advanced
concerning
me
is
correct
.
<EOS>
""Enough
,
fair
mistress
,
"
rejoined
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
say
you
,
Sirs
,
"
he
continued
,
in
a
stern
tone
,
to
the
two
extortioners
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
confess
your
guilt
,
and
sue
for
pardon
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
down
on
your
knees
before
this
injured
damsel
,
and
implore
her
forgiveness!"A
prey
to
violent
terror
,
the
old
usurer
instantly
adopted
the
supplicatory
posture
recommended
by
the
Prince
;
but
Sir
Giles
refused
compliance
.
<EOS>
"Having
<EOS>
committed
no
offence
,
I
sue
for
no
pardon
,
"
he
said
,
with
his
wonted
audacity
.
<EOS>
"
I
repel
the
charge
with
indignation
;
and
,
in
my
turn
,
accuse
Clement
Lanyere
and
Luke
Hatton
of
a
conspiracy
against
me
.
<EOS>
This
damsel
is
but
their
tool
,
as
I
will
show
,
if
your
Highness
will
deign
to
give
ear
to
me
.
<EOS>
""It
were
mere
waste
of
time
to
listen
to
idle
fabrications
,
"
replied
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
The
evidence
against
you
is
complete
,
and
my
opinion
upon
it
is
formed
.
<EOS>
But
what
saith
the
maiden
herself
?
<EOS>
Is
she
willing
that
any
grace
be
shown
her
persecutors?""The
<EOS>
redress
I
have
already
obtained
at
the
hands
of
your
Highness
is
amply
sufficient
,
"
replied
Aveline
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Great
as
has
been
the
misery
these
two
persons
have
occasioned
me
,
and
grievously
as
they
have
sought
to
injure
me
,
I
seek
no
further
satisfaction
;
but
would
implore
your
Highness
to
pardon
them
.
<EOS>
Their
own
thoughts
will
be
punishment
enough
.
<EOS>
""Amply
<EOS>
sufficient
—
for
nothing
can
be
more
bitter
,
"
cried
the
old
usurer
,
while
a
scornful
smile
curled
Sir
Giles
's
lips
.
<EOS>
"Spoken
<EOS>
as
I
expected
you
would
speak
,
fair
maiden
,
"
said
Charles
;
"
and
,
were
there
nothing
else
against
them
,
I
might
listen
to
your
kindly
intercessions
.
<EOS>
But
other
and
darker
disclosures
have
to
be
made
;
and
when
you
have
heard
all
,
even
your
compassionate
breast
may
be
steeled
against
them
.
<EOS>
Retire
for
a
moment
;
but
do
not
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
Your
presence
may
yet
be
needed
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
bowing
graciously
to
Aveline
,
she
withdrew
under
the
care
of
the
gentleman
who
had
brought
her
forward
,
but
still
remained
a
spectatress
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
"And
now
to
proceed
with
the
investigation
,
"
pursued
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
to
allege
against
the
two
persons
before
you
?
"
he
added
,
to
Clement
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
"Were
I
to
relate
all
their
enormities
,
most
gracious
Prince
,
"
replied
the
promoter
,
"
the
recital
would
be
too
painful
for
your
hearing
,
and
that
of
this
noble
assemblage
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
,
in
a
word
,
declare
that
there
is
no
kind
of
outrage
,
oppression
,
and
extortion
of
which
they
have
not
been
guilty
.
<EOS>
Their
insatiable
greediness
has
been
fed
by
constant
plunder
;
and
,
alike
cruel
and
rapacious
,
nothing
but
the
ruin
and
absolute
destruction
of
their
victims
would
content
them
.
<EOS>
Merciless
as
creditors
,
they
have
ground
their
unfortunate
debtors
to
the
dust
.
<EOS>
The
tears
of
the
widow
they
have
robbed
of
her
husband
and
her
means
of
existence
—
the
despair
of
the
orphan
,
whose
fair
prospects
they
have
blighted
—
have
failed
to
move
them
.
<EOS>
Utterly
unscrupulous
as
to
the
means
of
obtaining
possession
of
property
,
they
have
forged
wills
,
deeds
,
and
other
documents
.
<EOS>
Their
ingenuity
has
been
taxed
to
devise
new
means
of
unjust
gain
;
and
,
imposing
upon
the
King
's
Majesty
by
false
representations
,
they
have
succeeded
in
obtaining
his
letters
patent
for
certain
monopolies
,
which
they
have
so
shamefully
abused
,
as
to
bring
his
sovereign
authority
into
discredit
.
<EOS>
""Hold
!
"
cried
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
"
To
the
first
—
vague
and
general
accusations
brought
against
me
and
my
co
-
patentee
,
by
this
branded
traitor
,
who
,
having
been
publicly
punished
for
falsehood
and
libel
,
can
not
be
received
as
a
witness
,
I
have
deigned
no
answer
,
conceiving
such
accusations
can
not
be
for
a
moment
entertained
by
you
,
most
gracious
Prince
.
<EOS>
But
to
this
specific
charge
,
I
give
a
flat
denial
;
and
demand
proof
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
appeal
to
the
most
noble
Marquis
of
Buckingham
,
through
whose
interest
Sir
Francis
Mitchell
and
myself
obtained
those
patents
for
the
licences
of
inspection
of
inns
and
hostelries
,
as
well
as
for
the
manufacture
of
gold
and
silver
lace
,
whether
he
has
ever
heard
aught
to
our
disparagement
in
our
conduct
of
them?""Do
<EOS>
not
appeal
to
me
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Buckingham
,
coldly
.
"Sir
<EOS>
Giles
has
demanded
proof
of
my
charge
,
and
I
am
prepared
to
produce
it
,
"
said
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
the
vagueness
of
my
accusations
,
your
Highness
will
judge
of
that
when
the
full
catalogue
of
the
offences
of
these
two
extortioners
,
with
the
damnatory
proofs
of
them
,
shall
be
laid
before
you
.
<EOS>
This
memorial
,
signed
by
nearly
the
whole
of
the
sufferers
from
their
exactions
,
perpetrated
by
means
of
the
monopolies
,
will
satisfy
your
Highness
of
the
truth
of
my
statement
—
but
I
have
also
a
witness
to
call
.
<EOS>
""A
witness!—here
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Sir
Giles
,
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"
This
must
be
a
deeply
-
concerted
scheme
.
<EOS>
""Before
<EOS>
you
bring
forward
any
one
,
"
said
Charles
,
addressing
Lanyere
,
"
Sir
Giles
must
be
set
right
on
one
point
in
which
he
is
in
error
.
<EOS>
Your
credibility
is
not
to
be
disputed
,
and
I
accept
your
testimony
against
him
.
<EOS>
""Your
Highness
!
"
cried
the
extortioner
.
<EOS>
"Peace
,
Sir
!
<EOS>
you
shall
be
heard
anon
,
"
said
Charles
.

he
added
to
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
At
a
sign
from
the
promoter
,
Luke
Hatton
,
who
was
standing
near
the
doorway
,
stepped
behind
the
tapestry
,
and
almost
immediately
reappearing
with
Madame
Bonaventure
,
led
her
towards
the
Prince
,
before
whom
she
prostrated
herself
.
<EOS>
"Arise
<EOS>
,
Madame
,
"
said
Charles
,
graciously
.
<EOS>
"
Your
features
are
not
unfamiliar
to
me
.
<EOS>
Methinks
<EOS>
you
are
the
hostess
of
the
French
ordinary
at
the
tavern
of
the
Three
Cranes
,
in
the
Vintry
.
<EOS>
""Tour
<EOS>
Highness
is
in
the
right
—
I
am
Madame
Bonaventure
,
at
your
Highness
's
service

"
replied
the
hostess
,
enchanted
at
this
recognition
on
the
part
of
the
Prince
.
<EOS>
"
My
lord
of
Buckingham
,
I
am
well
persuaded
,
will
condescend
to
speak
to
the
merits
and
respectability
of
my
establishment
.
<EOS>
""In
sooth
<EOS>
will
I
,
good
hostess
,
"
replied
the
Marquis
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
give
your
Bordeaux
my
heartiest
commendation

<EOS>
Tis
the
best
in
London

<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
I
can
speak
to
it
myself

and
to
the
good
order
of
the
house
too
;
having
visited
the
tavern
incognito
,
"
remarked
the
Prince
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"Is
it
possible
!
"
exclaimed
Madame
Bonaventure
,
rapturously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
I
been
so
greatly
honoured
?
<EOS>
Mon
Dieu!—and
not
to
be
aware
of
it!""I
must
remind
you
of
the
cause
of
your
appearance
here
,
Madame
Bonaventure
,
"
said
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
"You
are
required
to
depose
before
his
Highness
as
to
the
exactions
you
suffered
from
Sir
Giles
and
his
partner
.
<EOS>
""His
<EOS>
Highness
shall
hear
all
from
me
,
"
rejoined
the
hostess
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
been
reduced
to
beggary
had
I
submitted
to
their
extortionate
usage
.
<EOS>
I
bore
it
as
long
as
I
could
,
but
when
absolute
ruin
stared
me
in
the
face
,
I
had
recourse
to
a
noble
friend
who
helped
me
in
my
extremity
and
delivered
me
by
a
,
stratagem
.
<EOS>
""It
was
a
fraudulent
scheme
,
"
cried
Sir
Giles;—"a
fraud
upon
his
Majesty
,
as
well
as
upon
those
who
enjoyed
the
privileges
conferred
by
his
letters
patent
.
<EOS>
""That
I
can
contradict
,
Sir
,
"
said
Buckingham
,
"
since
I
myself
was
present
on
the
occasion
,
and
stated
in
the
hearing
of
the
large
company
then
assembled,—several
of
whom
are
now
before
us,—that
his
Majesty
relinquished
all
share
of
the
ruinous
fine
of
three
thousand
marks
imposed
by
you
and
your
co
-
patentee
upon
this
good
woman
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
I
trust
you
added
,
my
Lord
,
that
the
King
's
Highness
would
never
knowingly
consent
to
have
his
exchequer
enriched
by
such
shameful
means
,
"
said
Charles
,
with
a
look
of
indignation
.
<EOS>
"
These
monopolies
were
not
granted
by
his
Majesty
for
the
wrongful
profit
of
their
holders
;
and
,
since
they
have
been
turned
to
such
iniquitous
use
,
I
will
take
upon
me
to
declare
that
they
shall
all
be
suppressed
.
<EOS>
Do
you
attempt
to
deny
,
"
he
continued
to
Sir
Giles
,
"
that
this
outrageous
fine
was
imposed?""It
were
useless
to
deny
it
,
"
replied
the
extortioner
,
with
a
malicious
look
at
Buckingham
;
"
but
the
noble
Marquis
has
not
always
disapproved
so
strongly
of
my
proceedings
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
can
show
that
he
himself
has
been
secretly
a
party
to
like
transactions
.
<EOS>
""Ah
,
villain
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Buckingham,—"do
you
venture
to
calumniate
your
protector
?
<EOS>
I
shall
leave
you
to
the
fate
you
so
richly
merit
.
<EOS>
Your
foul
and
false
assertions
can
not
affect
me
;
but
they
are
not
likely
to
improve
your
case
with
his
Highness
,
who
,
though
aware
of
its
impotency
,
will
perceive
the
extent
of
your
malice
.
<EOS>
If
you
dared
,
I
doubt
not
you
would
likewise
assert
that
his
Majesty
himself
was
cognisant
of
your
frauds
and
oppressions
,
and
approved
them
.
<EOS>
""I
do
assert
,
and
will
maintain
it
—
ay
,
and
prove
it
,
too
—
that
the
King
's
Highness
was
aware
how
these
monopolies
were
managed
,
and
derived
a
considerable
revenue
from
them
,
"
said
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
hear
him
,
Prince
,
"
remarked
Buckingham
,
with
a
disdainful
smile
.
<EOS>
"I
would
not
have
believed
in
such
matchless
effrontery
<EOS>
had
I
not
witnessed
it
,
"
replied
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
retire
,
Madame
,
"
he
added
to
the
hostess
,
who
,
with
a
profound
reverence
,
withdrew
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
aught
further
to
declare
,
or
any
other
witnesses
to
produce
?
"
<EOS>
he
continued
to
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
both
,
your
Highness
,
"
replied
the
promoter
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
more
false
accusations
have
you
to
bring
against
me
?
"
demanded
Sir
Giles
,
folding
his
arms
upon
his
breast
,
and
fixing
his
keen
gaze
upon
Lanyere
.
"His
<EOS>
Highness
shall
hear
,
"
replied
the
promoter
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
multitude
of
cases
which
I
could
adduce
in
support
of
my
charges
—
all
of
which
will
be
mentioned
in
due
season
—
but
I
shall
now
content
myself
with
one
,
and
from
it
the
nature
of
the
rest
may
be
inferred
.
<EOS>
But
let
me
premise
that
,
in
the
greater
part
of
these
cases
,
and
in
all
the
more
important
of
them
,
where
grievous
and
irreparable
wrong
has
been
committed
,
the
engine
employed
by
these
crafty
and
dangerous
men
has
been
the
Star
-
Chamber
.
<EOS>
""The
Star
-
Chamber
!
"
exclaimed
Charles
,
bending
his
brows
.
<EOS>
"Your
Highness
will
now
perceive
the
drift
of
this
cunning
knave
's
argument
,
"
said
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"
Through
me
and
my
partner
,
all
whose
actions
will
bear
the
strictest
scrutiny
,
he
would
covertly
attack
that
high
and
honourable
Court
,
whose
dignity
we
have
ever
been
most
zealous
to
maintain
;
and
<EOS>
his
motive
for
doing
so
is
because
he
has
incurred
its
censure
.
<EOS>
When
I
have
heard
his
precise
charges
,
I
will
reply
to
them
—
ay
,
one
by
one
—
if
he
will
bring
forward
the
multitude
of
cases
he
affirms
he
can
produce
against
me
.
<EOS>
But
meanwhile
I
can
fearlessly
declare
my
innocence
of
the
wrong
imputed
to
me
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
been
to
blame
in
those
monopolies
,
I
am
not
the
only
one
in
fault
,
as
time
will
show
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
there
are
greater
culprits
than
I"—looking
hard
at
Buckingham
,
who
regarded
him
<EOS>
disdainfully—"but
<EOS>
I
deny
that
I
have
done
more
than
I
can
fully
justify
.
<EOS>
As
regards
other
matters
,
and
the
way
in
which
my
wealth
has
been
acquired
,
I
have
acted
only
with
caution
,
prudence
,
and
foresight
.
<EOS>
Is
it
my
fault
that
there
are
so
many
persons
who
,
from
various
causes
,
will
have
money
,
no
matter
what
they
pay
for
it
?
<EOS>
If
they
apply
to
me
under
such
circumstances
,
and
ruin
ensues
to
them
,
am
I
to
blame
?
<EOS>
I
lend
monies
as
a
usurer
—
all
men
know
it
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
my
vocation
,
and
that
of
my
partner
;
and
my
answer
is
his
answer
.
<EOS>
We
have
done
nothing
beyond
the
law
;
and
the
law
,
which
has
hitherto
supported
us
,
will
support
us
still
.
<EOS>
To
affirm
that
we
have
employed
the
highest
court
of
the
kingdom
as
an
instrument
of
oppression
and
extortion
is
an
assertion
too
monstrous
to
obtain
a
moment
's
credit
.
<EOS>
The
Star
-
Chamber
is
too
jealous
of
its
honour
not
to
resent
the
imputation
;
and
such
a
charge
will
not
escape
its
censure
.
<EOS>
""Nevertheless
,
at
whatever
risk
,
I
repeat
the
accusation
,
"
rejoined
Lanyere
;
"
and
my
words
will
not
be
forgotten
by
his
Highness
,
and
by
all
others
who
hear
them
.
<EOS>
I
assert
that
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
has
subtly
and
designedly
perverted
the
practice
of
that
high
and
honourable
Court
,
causing
it
to
aid
his
schemes
of
rapacity
and
injustice
,
and
using
it
as
a
means
of
stifling
the
cries
of
his
victims
,
and
working
out
his
purposes
of
vengeance
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
he
has
succeeded
in
masking
his
designs
with
so
much
skill
that
they
have
escaped
detection
;
but
when
the
mischief
he
has
done
under
the
mask
of
justice
,
and
the
wrongs
and
cruelties
he
has
perpetrated
in
the
name
of
the
law
shall
be
fully
made
known
,
no
punishment
will
be
deemed
commensurate
to
his
crimes
.
<EOS>
It
is
chiefly
he
and
his
partner
who
,
by
their
evil
doings
,
have
brought
the
Star
-
Chamber
into
disrepute
,
and
made
it
a
terror
to
all
just
men
,
who
have
dreaded
being
caught
within
the
toils
woven
around
it
by
these
infamous
wretches
;
and
the
Court
will
do
well
to
purge
itself
of
such
villanies
,
and
make
a
terrible
example
of
those
who
have
so
dishonoured
it
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
Star
-
Chamber
will
never
desert
its
faithful
servants
,
and
such
we
have
been
,
"
said
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"Say
<EOS>
rather
the
serpents
it
has
nourished
in
its
bosom
,
"
rejoined
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
"
But
to
my
case
.
<EOS>
Years
ago
,
a
gentleman
possessed
of
noble
estates
in
Norfolk
,
was
unfortunate
enough
to
have
some
dealings
with
these
two
usurers
,
who
thus
becoming
acquainted
with
his
circumstances
,
marked
him
for
their
prey
.
<EOS>
He
borrowed
a
large
sum
of
money
from
them
.
<EOS>
The
loan
was
not
obtained
for
himself
,
but
for
a
younger
brother"—here
the
voice
of
the
promoter
was
choked
with
emotion
,
and
a
few
moments
elapsed
before
he
could
proceed—"I
have
said
that
the
money
was
borrowed
,
not
for
himself
,
but
for
a
younger
brother
,
whose
recklessness
and
extravagance
had
plunged
him
deeply
in
debt
.
<EOS>
Would
that
his
too
generous
relative
had
left
him
to
his
fate
,
and
allowed
him
to
rot
in
a
dungeon
!
<EOS>
But
he
rescued
him
from
it
,
only
to
take
his
place
in
the
end
.
<EOS>
From
this
sad
epoch
may
all
the
unfortunate
gentleman
's
calamities
be
dated
.
<EOS>
Certain
title
-
deeds
and
other
instruments
had
to
be
deposited
with
Sir
Giles
and
his
partner
,
as
security
for
repayment
of
the
sum
borrowed
.
<EOS>
They
were
never
returned
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
under
one
plea
or
another
,
all
the
deeds
relating
to
the
property
were
obtained
from
its
unsuspecting
owner
;
and
then
a
mortgage
deed
covering
the
whole
estates
was
forged
by
them
.
<EOS>
""'Tis
<EOS>
false
!
"
exclaimed
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
I
your
Highness
's
gracious
promise
of
pardon
to
all
except
the
principals
in
these
great
offences
?
"
pursued
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
it
may
materially
serve
the
ends
of
justice
that
such
promise
should
be
given
,
I
do
not
hesitate
to
comply
with
your
request
,
"
replied
Charles
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
that
case
I
shall
be
able
to
confound
the
villains
with
a
witness
whom
they
little
expect
to
be
produced
against
them
,
"
replied
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
Lupo
Vulp
be
called
,
"
he
added
.
<EOS>
The
summons
was
responded
to
as
before
by
Luke
Hatton
,
and
the
next
moment
the
ill
-
favoured
scrivener
emerged
from
behind
the
tapestry
,
and
made
his
way
through
the
assemblage
,
who
recoiled
with
abhorrence
from
him
,
towards
the
Prince
.
"Who
<EOS>
art
thou
?
"
demanded
Charles
.
<EOS>
"I
am
named
Lupo
Vulp
,
your
Highness
,
and
have
for
many
years
been
a
money
-
scrivener
in
the
employ
of
these
two
gentlemen
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
individual
addressed
.
<EOS>
"Thou
knowest
all
their
transactions
?
"
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
man
better
,
"
answered
Lupo
;
"
unless
it
be
Clement
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
""You
remember
a
certain
deed
of
mortgage
from
Sir
Ferdinando
Mounchensey
to
your
two
employers
?
"
said
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
remember
it
perfectly
,
"
returned
the
scrivener
,
"
as
I
should
do
,
seeing
I
prepared
it
myself
.
<EOS>
"During
<EOS>
all
this
time
Lupo
Vulp
had
kept
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
,
and
had
never
dared
to
raise
them
towards
Sir
Giles
,
though
he
felt
that
the
gaze
of
the
latter
was
fixed
upon
him
.
"Was
<EOS>
Sir
Ferdinando
's
signature
attached
to
that
deed
?
"
demanded
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
"Look
at
me
,
Lupo
,
ere
thou
answerest
,
"
cried
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"
Look
at
me
well
—
and
take
heed
what
thou
say'st
.
<EOS>
""Be
not
influenced
by
him
,
"
interposed
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
Look
only
at
me
,
and
speak
truly
,
as
thou
valuest
thy
safety
.
<EOS>
If
thou
hidest
aught
,
or
falsifiest
aught
,
the
heaviest
punishment
awaits
thee!""Hark
ye
,
Lupo
,
"
said
Sir
Giles
,
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
"
Be
warned
by
me
.
<EOS>
Utter
a
word
to
my
detriment
,
and
as
surely
as
thou
art
suborned
to
injure
me
,
I
will
hang
thee
.
<EOS>
I
can
do
so
,
as
thou
knowest!""Fear
<EOS>
him
not

Lupo

said
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thou
hast
his
Highness
's
gracious
promise
of
pardon

<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
my
life
be
but
spared
,
most
gracious
Prince
,
"
said
the
scrivener
,
falling
on
his
knees
,
and
clasping
his
hands
together
in
supplication
,
"
I
will
reveal
all
I
know
touching
the
malpractices
of
these
two
persons
.
<EOS>
""Speak
,
then
,
without
fear
,
"
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
repeat
my
question
,
"
said
Lanyere
,
"
and
demand
an
explicit
answer
to
it
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
nature
of
that
deed?""It
was
a
forgery
,
"
replied
the
scrivener
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Ferdinando
Mounchensey
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
His
signature
was
imitated
from
other
deeds
in
the
possession
of
my
employers
,
and
his
seal
was
likewise
fabricated
.
<EOS>
""What
say
you
to
this
,
Sir
?
"
said
Charles
,
to
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
deny
it
,
as
I
do
all
the
rest
,
"
he
replied
.
"
<EOS>
'
Tis
a
foul
conspiracy
against
me

<EOS>
""This
is
only
one
amongst
many
such
frauds
committed
by
them
,
your
Highness
,
"
said
the
scrivener
.
<EOS>
"
Since
I
have
your
gracious
promise
of
pardon
,
I
will
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
,
and
reveal
all
I
know
.
<EOS>
Many
and
many
a
fair
estate
has
been
wrongfully
wrested
from
its
owner
in
this
way
—
by
forged
deed
or
will
.
<EOS>
I
will
name
all
the
parties
to
your
Highness
.
<EOS>
""Hereafter
<EOS>
,
I
will
listen
to
thee
,
"
rejoined
Charles
,
motioning
him
to
rise
;
"
but
I
shall
now
confine
myself
to
the
case
immediately
before
me
.
<EOS>
Proceed
,
Sir
,
"
he
added
,
to
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
"I
have
come
to
the
saddest
and
darkest
part
of
all
,
"
said
the
promoter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
Highness
has
seen
that
a
deed
was
forged
to
obtain
possession
of
the
Mounchensey
estates
—
and
the
fraudulent
design
was
only
too
successful
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
Sir
Ferdinando
denied
all
knowledge
of
the
instrument
—
<EOS>
in
vain
he
refused
payment
of
the
large
sum
demanded
—
his
estates
were
seized
by
the
extortioners
—
and
he
was
deprived
of
the
power
of
redemption
.
<EOS>
He
commenced
a
suit
against
them
in
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
but
here
again
he
was
baffled
by
the
cunning
and
knavery
of
Sir
Giles
,
and
having
unwittingly
incurred
the
censure
of
the
Court
,
he
was
cast
into
the
Fleet
Prison
,
where
he
perished
miserably
.
<EOS>
""A
lamentable
history
,
"
exclaimed
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
grievous
to
think
that
justice
can
not
be
done
him
.
<EOS>
""Justice
<EOS>
may
he
done
his
son
,
"
said
Buckingham
,
"
who
has
been
oppressed
in
like
manner
with
his
father
.
<EOS>
Restitution
may
be
made
him
of
the
estates
of
which
he
has
been
plundered
.
<EOS>
""It
is
well
,
"
said
Sir
Giles
,
glancing
at
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
enjoy
them
.
<EOS>
""What
means
he
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Charles
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
estates
were
assigned
to
this
treacherous
knave
,
your
Highness
,
"
said
Sir
Giles
,
pointing
to
Lanyere
,
"
for
a
certain
consideration
,
which
was
never
performed
.
<EOS>
But
,
while
denying
,
as
I
do
most
energetically
,
that
any
underhand
means
whatever
were
used
by
us
to
obtain
possession
of
those
estates
,
and
repeating
my
declaration
that
a
most
artful
conspiracy
has
been
formed
against
us
<EOS>
,
I
assert
,
as
will
appear
on
investigation
,
that
if
I
fail
in
sustaining
my
claim
to
the
Mounchensey
estates
,
they
can
not
go
to
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
""Wherefore
<EOS>
not
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Charles
.
"Because
<EOS>
Sir
Ferdinando
left
them
to
his
brother
Osmond
.
<EOS>
I
have
possession
of
his
will
.
<EOS>
""It
may
be
a
forgery
,
"
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
so
,
your
Highness
,
"
observed
Lupo
Vulp
.
<EOS>
"
This
statement
is
correct
.
<EOS>
""I
have
it
with
me
now
,
"
cried
Sir
Giles
,
producing
a
document
.
<EOS>
"
Will
it
please
your
Highness
to
look
at
it
?
"
he
added
,
handing
it
to
the
Prince
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
that
the
estates
are
wholly
left
to
Osmond
Mounchensey
.
<EOS>
If
,
therefore
,
your
Highness
should
seek
to
deprive
me
of
them
,
you
must
bestow
them
as
they
are
herein
bequeathed
.
<EOS>
""Undoubtedly
,
if
this
instrument
be
valid
,
"
said
Charles
,
looking
at
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
not
dispute
it
,
your
Highness
,
"
said
the
promoter
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
there
is
no
proof
that
Osmond
Mounchensey
is
living
,
your
Highness
,
"
observed
Lupo
Vulp
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
not
been
heard
of
for
many
years
—
not
,
indeed
,
since
the
time
when
his
debts
were
paid
by
Sir
Ferdinando
.
<EOS>
Though
Sir
Giles
has
used
every
exertion
for
the
purpose
,
he
has
never
been
able
to
discover
any
traces
of
him
—
and
it
is
reasonable
,
therefore
,
to
suppose
that
he
is
no
more
.
<EOS>
""That
is
false
,
"
cried
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
I
have
long
sought
for
him
in
vain
—
but
within
these
few
days
I
have
obtained
some
tidings
of
him
,
which
,
if
followed
up
,
will
assuredly
lead
to
his
detection
.
<EOS>
Nay
more
,
Lanyere
himself
must
know
that
he
is
alive
,
since
,
from
the
intelligence
I
have
received
,
he
must
have
been
recently
in
company
with
him
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
this
assertion
correct
?
"
said
Charles
,
to
the
promoter
.
<EOS>
"It
is
,
your
Highness
,
"
replied
Lanyere
;
"
but
I
had
good
reasons
for
concealing
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
""Undoubtedly
,
"
cried
Sir
Giles
;
"
because
you
had
ascertained
from
the
traitor
Lupo
that
this
will
existed
,
and
feared
a
claim
might
be
advanced
to
the
estates
—
but
they
will
never
be
yours
,
or
Sir
Jocelyn
's
.
<EOS>
If
not
mine
,
they
are
Osmond
Mounchensey's
.
<EOS>
""He
says
right
,
"
remarked
Charles
.
<EOS>
"Then
learn
to
your
confusion
,
villain
,
that
Osmond
Mounchensey
stands
before
you
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
promoter
,
addressing
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"
Behold
him
in
me!""You
Osmond
Mounchensey
!
"
exclaimed
Sir
Giles
;
eyeing
him
with
an
astonishment
which
was
shared
by
Sir
Francis
and
by
the
greater
part
of
the
spectators
.
<EOS>
To
judge
from
their
manner
,
however
,
Prince
Charles
,
together
with
Buckingham
and
De
Gondomar
,
did
not
seem
unprepared
for
the
announcement
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
"
rejoined
Osmond
to
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"
Look
on
me
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
Never
should
my
name
have
been
revealed
to
you
,
except
at
a
moment
when
there
should
have
been
no
chance
of
its
repetition
,
on
your
part
,
but
for
my
brother
's
will
,
of
the
existence
of
which
I
have
only
been
lately
aware
,
and
which
has
obliged
me
to
avow
myself
.
<EOS>
But
for
this
,
I
would
have
remained
for
ever
in
obscurity
,
and
have
perished
as
I
have
lived
—
the
despised
Clement
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
The
name
of
Mounchensey
should
not
have
been
shamed
in
me
.
<EOS>
But
if
I
am
the
reproach
of
that
ancient
and
honourable
house
—
untarnished
by
any
other
member
of
it
—
I
am
also
its
avenger
,
and
will
wipe
out
effectually
the
stains
you
have
cast
upon
it
.
<EOS>
By
your
machinations
,
villain
,
was
my
brother
destroyed
—
by
your
machinations
has
his
son
been
imprisoned
,
and
his
life
endangered
—
by
your
machinations
<EOS>
I
myself
was
censured
by
the
terrible
Star
-
Chamber
,
and
its
severest
punishments
inflicted
upon
me
.
<EOS>
You
knew
not
whom
you
tortured
;
and
had
you
been
aware
of
my
real
name
,
even
this
wrong
might
not
have
contented
you
.
<EOS>
But
no
matter
.
<EOS>
From
the
hour
when
the
tormentor
,
by
your
order
,
did
his
work
upon
me
,
I
devoted
myself
to
vengeance
—
slow
,
sure
vengeance
.
<EOS>
I
resolved
not
to
interfere
with
your
career
of
villany
till
you
were
full
-
blown
in
crime
;
and
though
I
have
had
some
difficulty
in
holding
back
my
hand
,
I
have
been
patient
.
<EOS>
The
hour
at
length
has
arrived
,
and
I
hold
you
firmly
in
my
grasp
.
<EOS>
I
have
crushed
in
pieces
the
whole
of
the
fabric
you
have
been
at
such
pains
to
rear
.
<EOS>
Your
estates
and
all
your
possessions
will
be
forfeited
to
the
Crown
;
and
,
if
you
escape
with
life
,
you
will
bear
the
indelible
marks
of
disgrace
which
you
have
inflicted
upon
me!"Overpowered
by
what
he
heard
,
Sir
Giles
threw
himself
at
the
feet
of
Charles
.
<EOS>
"Do
not
sue
to
me
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
Prince
,
regarding
him
with
stern
displeasure
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Enough
for
you
to
know
that
I
have
been
in
this
much
-
injured
gentleman
's
secret
.
<EOS>
Let
your
nephew
now
be
introduced
,
Sir
,
"
he
added
,
to
Osmond
Mounchensey
.
"His
<EOS>
nephew
!
<EOS>
"
muttered
Sir
Giles
,
as
he
arose
.
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
then
,
all
is
indeed
lost!""I
have
felt
that
for
a
long
time

groaned
Sir
Francis

CHAPTER
XXXII.Judgment
.
<EOS>
On
the
intimation
of
the
Prince
's
wishes
,
the
tapestry
was
again
raised
to
admit
Sir
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
,
who
,
stepping
forward
,
made
a
profound
reverence
to
the
Prince
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
greet
you
well
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
"
said
Charles
,
in
the
kindest
and
most
gracious
tone
,
as
the
young
knight
advanced
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
your
disgrace
was
public
,
so
shall
<EOS>
your
restoration
to
the
King
's
favour
be
likewise
public
.
<EOS>
Your
return
to
Court
will
be
a
satisfaction
to
his
Majesty
.
<EOS>
Any
imprudence
of
which
you
have
been
guilty
will
be
entirely
overlooked
.
<EOS>
All
graver
faults
imputed
to
you
have
been
explained
—
so
that
no
unfavourable
impressions
against
you
remain
upon
my
royal
father
's
mind
—
or
on
mine
.
<EOS>
Let
me
assure
you
that
you
have
now
no
more
zealous
friends
than
the
Conde
de
Gondomar
and
the
Marquis
of
Buckingham
.
<EOS>
""For
<EOS>
any
wrong
<EOS>
I
may
have
done
Sir
Jocelyn
<EOS>
I
am
heartily
sorry
,
"
said
Buckingham
,
frankly
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
may
rely
on
my
present
oiler
of
friendship
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
on
mine
,
too
,
"
subjoined
De
Gondomar
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
services
I
have
rendered
him
must
be
set
against
any
mischief
I
have
subsequently
done
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
make
me
more
than
amends
,
"
said
Sir
Jocelyn
,
bowing
to
them
,
"
and
I
at
once
accept
your
proffered
friendship
.
<EOS>
""You
are
in
the
midst
of
friends
and
foes
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
"
said
Prince
Charles
,
"
and
have
before
you
a
new
-
found
relative
;
and
not
far
distant
from
you
one
,
whom
—
unless
I
am
greatly
mistaken
—
has
the
strongest
hold
upon
your
affections
;
but
before
you
turn
to
her
,
or
to
any
one
,
listen
to
the
sentence
,
which
in
the
King
's
name
I
shall
pronounce
upon
those
two
offenders
—
a
sentence
which
most
assuredly
will
be
ratified
by
his
Majesty
in
person
,
and
by
the
Lords
of
the
Council
of
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
before
whom
they
will
be
brought
.
<EOS>
Hear
me
,
then
,
ye
wrong
-
doers
.
<EOS>
Ye
shall
be
despoiled
of
your
unjustly
-
acquired
possessions
,
which
will
be
escheated
to
the
Crown
.
<EOS>
Where
restitution
is
possible
,
it
shall
be
made
.
<EOS>
""Restitution
<EOS>
by
the
Crown!—a
likely
thing
!
"
muttered
Sir
Giles
.
<EOS>
"Moreover
<EOS>
,
ye
shall
pay
for
your
misdeeds
in
person
,
"
pursued
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
Degraded
from
the
knighthood
ye
have
dishonoured
,
and
with
all
the
ceremonies
of
debasement
,
when
ye
have
become
Giles
Mompesson
and
Francis
Mitchell
,
knaves
,
ye
shall
undergo
precisely
the
same
ignominious
punishment
,
with
all
its
dreadful
details
,
which
ye
caused
to
be
inflicted
upon
him
you
supposed
to
be
Clement
Lanyere
.
<EOS>
This
being
done
to
you
,
and
no
part
of
the
torture
being
on
any
plea
omitted
,
ye
shall
be
brought
back
to
the
Fleet
Prison
,
and
be
there
incarcerated
for
the
residue
of
your
lives
.
<EOS>
"Mompesson
<EOS>
heard
this
sentence
apparently
unmoved
,
though
his
flashing
eye
betrayed
,
in
some
degree
,
his
secret
emotion
.
<EOS>
Not
so
his
partner
.
<EOS>
Flinging
himself
on
his
knees
before
the
Prince
,
he
cried
in
piteous
tones—"I
<EOS>
confess
my
manifold
offences
,
and
own
that
my
sentence
is
lenient
in
comparison
with
them
.
<EOS>
But
I
beseech
your
Highness
to
spare
me
the
mutilation
and
branding
.
<EOS>
All
else
I
will
patiently
endure
.
<EOS>
""He
merits
no
compassion
,
"
said
Buckingham
,
"
<EOS>
and
yet
I
would
intercede
for
him
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
your
intercession
shall
avail
to
the
extent
which
he
himself
hath
mentioned
—
but
no
further
,
"
rejoined
Charles
.
<EOS>
"I
solicit
nothing
—
<EOS>
and
I
confess
nothing
,
"
said
Mompesson
,
in
a
tone
of
defiance
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
am
ever
brought
to
trial
I
shall
know
how
to
defend
myself
.
<EOS>
But
I
well
know
that
will
never
be
.
<EOS>
I
can
make
such
revelations
concerning
those
in
high
places
—
ay
,
in
the
highest
places
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
vindictive
look
at
Buckingham
,
"
that
they
will
not
dare
to
molest
me
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
hound
must
be
muzzled
,
"
said
Buckingham
,
in
a
low
tone
,
to
the
Prince
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
must
,
"
replied
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
Let
the
prisoners
be
removed
.
<EOS>
They
are
committed
to
the
Fleet
Prison
.
""Prisoners
!
"
exclaimed
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
prisoners
,
"
repeated
Osmond
Mounchensey
,
"
my
prisoners
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
Star
-
Chamber
warrant
for
your
arrest
.
<EOS>
Behold
it
.
<EOS>
Under
this
warrant
his
Highness
has
committed
you
,
and
you
will
be
taken
hence
to
the
Fleet
,
where
you
,
Giles
Mompesson
,
shall
occupy
the
cell
you
destined
for
my
nephew
!
<EOS>
Now
,
your
sword
.
<EOS>
""Take
it
<EOS>
,
"
rejoined
Mompesson
,
plucking
the
rapier
from
its
sheath
,
"
take
it
in
your
heart
.
<EOS>
You
,
at
least
,
shall
not
live
to
enjoy
your
triumph
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
Osmond
was
too
quick
for
him
,
and
seizing
his
arm
,
ere
<EOS>
he
could
deal
the
meditated
blow
,
with
almost
superhuman
force
,
he
wrested
the
sword
from
him
,
and
broke
it
beneath
his
feet
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
other
personages
appeared
on
the
scene
.
<EOS>
These
were
the
Serjeant
-
at
-
arms
and
a
party
of
halberdiers
.
<EOS>
Advancing
slowly
towards
the
prisoners
,
the
officer
received
the
warrant
from
Osmond
Mounchensey
,
while
the
halberdiers
closed
round
the
two
extortioners
.
"Before
<EOS>
the
prisoner
,
Mompesson
,
is
removed
,
"
said
Charles
,
"
see
that
he
delivers
up
to
you
his
keys
.
<EOS>
Let
an
inventory
be
taken
of
all
monies
within
the
house
,
and
let
the
royal
seal
be
placed
upon
all
boxes
and
caskets
.
<EOS>
All
deeds
and
other
documents
must
be
carefully
preserved
to
be
examined
hereafter
.
<EOS>
And
let
strict
search
be
made
—
for
I
have
heard
there
are
many
hidden
depositories
of
treasure
—
especially
within
the
prisoner
's
secret
cabinet
.
<EOS>
""Take
<EOS>
heed
that
the
strictest
examination
be
made
,
"
subjoined
Buckingham
,
"
in
accordance
with
his
Highness
's
behests
—
for
the
knave
smiles
,
as
if
he
thought
his
precautions
were
so
well
taken
that
the
searchers
would
be
baffled
.
<EOS>
""Fear
nothing
,
my
Lord
Marquis
,
"
replied
the
Serjant
-
at
-
arms
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
prisoner
,
"
he
added
,
to
Mompesson—"your
keys!"While
<EOS>
the
officer
was
thus
employed
,
Luke
Hatton
stepped
forward
.
<EOS>
"Those
<EOS>
keys
will
be
of
little
use
,
"
he
said
,
to
the
Prince
.
<EOS>
"
Others
have
been
beforehand
with
your
Highness
.
<EOS>
""How
,
Sir
—
what
others
?
"
demanded
Charles
,
bending
his
brows
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
extortioner
's
lawless
band
of
attendants
—
generally
known
as
his
myrmidons
,
your
Highness
,
"
replied
Hatton
.
"
<EOS>
Instinctively
discerning
,
as
it
would
seem
,
that
all
was
over
with
their
master
,
they
had
determined
to
quit
his
service
,
and
without
giving
him
any
notice
of
their
intention
.
<EOS>
Not
content
with
deserting
him
in
the
hour
of
danger
,
they
have
robbed
him
as
well
—
robbed
him
of
the
bulk
of
his
treasure
.
<EOS>
They
have
broken
into
his
secret
cabinet
—
and
stripped
it
of
all
its
valuables
that
could
be
of
use
to
them
,
and
have
not
left
one
of
his
hidden
hoards
unvisited
.
<EOS>
""Hell
's
curses
upon
them
!
"
exclaimed
Mompesson
,
with
irrepressible
rage
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
May
they
all
swing
upon
the
gibbet!""The
chief
among
them
—
a
rascally
Alsatian
,
known
as
Captain
Bludder
—
has
been
captured
,
"
pursued
Luke
Hatton
.
<EOS>
"
And
a
large
sum
,
together
with
a
rich
casket
of
jewels
,
has
been
found
upon
him
;
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
officers
will
succeed
in
finding
the
others
.
<EOS>
Will
your
Highness
interrogate
Bludder?""Not
now
,
"
replied
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
Let
him
be
taken
to
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
But
there
were
other
matters
of
more
importance
than
the
treasures
—
the
deeds
and
legal
instruments
.
<EOS>
These
,
as
being
useless
to
the
robbers
,
were
probably
left
untouched
.
<EOS>
""They
were
so
,
your
Highness
,
"
replied
Luke
Hatton
.
<EOS>
"Would
they
had
burned
them
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
"
Would
all
had
been
destroyed!"And
<EOS>
he
gave
utterance
to
such
wild
exclamations
of
rage
,
accompanied
by
such
frenzied
gestures
,
that
the
halberdiers
seized
him
,
and
dragged
him
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
old
usurer
was
removed
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
now
,
"
said
Charles
,
rising
from
his
chair
,
"
one
thing
only
remains
to
be
done
ere
I
depart
,
and
it
will
he
pleasanter
to
me
than
aught
that
has
preceded
it
.
<EOS>
I
must
again
address
myself
to
you
,
Sir
Jocelyn
Mounchensey
,
ay
,
and
to
you
,
also
,
fair
Mistress
Aveline
.
<EOS>
I
pray
you
to
come
near
me
,
"
he
continued
,
with
a
gracious
smile
,
to
the
damsel
.
<EOS>
And
,
as
she
blushingly
complied,—for
<EOS>
she
half
divined
his
purpose,—he
said—"As
<EOS>
I
have
already
told
you
,
Sir
Jocelyn
,
your
restoration
to
the
King
's
favour
is
complete
,
and
your
re
-
appearance
at
Court
would
be
a
gratification
to
his
Majesty
,
but
,
after
the
events
which
have
occurred
,
a
brief
retirement
will
,
I
conceive
,
be
most
agreeable
to
you
,
and
I
would
counsel
a
visit
to
the
hall
of
your
ancestors
.
<EOS>
""Nothing
could
be
more
in
accordance
with
my
own
wishes
,
most
gracious
Prince
,
if
my
newly
-
found
relative
will
accept
me
as
his
guest
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
as
his
guest
,
my
good
nephew
"
said
Osmond
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
sole
lord
of
Mounchensey
.
<EOS>
I
have
made
over
the
mansion
and
all
the
estates
to
you
.
<EOS>
They
are
yours
,
as
by
right
they
should
be
.
<EOS>
"Sir
<EOS>
Jocelyn
's
emotion
was
too
great
to
allow
him
to
express
his
gratitude
in
words
.
<EOS>
"A
noble
gift
!
"
exclaimed
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
not
go
there
alone
,
Sir
Jocelyn
.
<EOS>
You
must
take
a
bride
with
you
.
<EOS>
This
fair
lady
has
well
approved
her
love
for
you
—
as
you
have
the
depth
of
your
devotion
to
her
.
<EOS>
Take
her
from
my
hands
.
<EOS>
Take
her
to
jour
heart
;
and
may
years
of
fondest
wedded
happiness
attend
you
both
!
<EOS>
When
you
re
-
appear
at
Court
,
you
will
be
all
the
more
welcome
if
Lady
Mounchensey
be
with
you
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
placed
Aveline
's
hand
in
that
of
her
lover
;
and
,
with
a
look
of
ineffable
delight
,
they
knelt
to
express
their
gratitude
.
<EOS>
The
Prince
and
the
courtly
train
passed
out
—
and
,
lastly
,
Sir
Jocelyn
and
the
object
of
his
affections
.
<EOS>
Vainly
did
he
seek
for
his
relative
and
benefactor
.
<EOS>
Osmond
Mounchensey
had
disappeared
.
<EOS>
But
,
just
as
the
young
Knight
and
his
fair
companion
were
quitting
the
house
,
Luke
Hatton
,
followed
by
two
porters
,
bearing
a
stout
chest
,
approached
them
,
and
said—"Sir
Jocelyn
,
you
have
seen
the
last
of
your
uncle
.
<EOS>
He
has
charged
me
to
bid
you
an
eternal
adieu
.
<EOS>
You
will
never
hear
of
him
again
,
unless
you
hear
of
his
death
.
<EOS>
May
no
thoughts
of
him
mar
your
happiness
—
or
that
of
her
<EOS>
you
love
.
<EOS>
This
is
what
he
bade
<EOS>
me
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
This
chest
contains
the
title
-
deeds
of
your
estates
—
and
amongst
them
is
a
deed
of
gift
from
him
to
you
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
conveyed
by
these
porters
whithersoever
you
may
direct
them
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
having
discharged
mine
office
,
I
must
take
my
leave
.
<EOS>
""Stay
,
Sir
,
"
cried
Sir
Jocelyn
;
"
I
would
fain
send
a
message
to
my
uncle
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
convey
it
,
"
replied
Luke
Hatton
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
rest
content
with
what
I
have
told
you
.
<EOS>
To
you
,
and
to
all
others
,
Osmond
Mounchensey
is
as
the
dead
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
hastily
retreated
.
<EOS>
Three
days
after
this
,
the
loving
pair
were
wedded
;
and
the
ceremony
—
which
was
performed
with
strict
privacy
,
in
accordance
with
the
wishes
of
the
bride
—
being
concluded
,
they
set
out
upon
their
journey
into
Norfolk
.
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
had
noticed
among
the
spectators
of
the
marriage
rites
,
a
tall
personage
wrapped
in
a
sable
cloak
,
whom
he
suspected
to
be
his
uncle
;
but
,
as
the
individual
was
half
hidden
by
a
pillar
of
the
ancient
fabric
,
and
as
he
lost
sight
of
him
before
he
could
seek
him
out
,
he
never
could
be
quite
sure
of
the
fact
.
<EOS>
Sir
Jocelyn
's
arrival
at
the
hall
of
his
ancestors
was
the
occasion
of
great
rejoicings
;
and
,
in
spite
of
the
temptations
held
out
to
him
,
many
years
elapsed
ere
he
and
Lady
Mounchensey
revisited
the
scene
of
their
troubles
in
London
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXXIII.Retribution
.
<EOS>
As
will
have
been
foreseen
,
the
judgment
pronounced
by
Prince
Charles
upon
Mompesson
and
his
partner
,
was
confirmed
by
the
King
and
the
Lords
of
the
Council
,
when
the
two
offenders
were
brought
<EOS>
be
them
in
the
Star
-
Chamber
.
<EOS>
They
were
both
degraded
from
the
honour
of
knighthood
;
and
Mitchell
,
besides
being
so
heavily
fined
that
all
his
ill
-
gotten
wealth
was
wrested
from
him
,
had
to
endure
the
in
of
riding
through
the
streets
—
in
a
posture
the
reverse
of
the
ordinary
mode
of
equitation
—
name
with
his
face
towards
the
horse
's
tail
,
two
quart
pots
tied
round
his
neck
,
to
show
that
he
was
punished
I
for
his
exactions
upon
ale
-
house
keepers
and
hostel
-
keepers
,
and
a
placard
upon
his
breast
,
detailing
the
nature
of
his
offences
.
<EOS>
In
this
way,—hooted
and
pelted
by
the
rabble
,
who
pursued
him
as
he
was
led
along
,
and
who
would
have
inflicted
serious
injuries
upon
him
,
and
perhaps
despatched
him
outright
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
escort
by
whom
he
was
protected,—he
was
taken
in
turn
to
all
such
taverns
and
houses
of
entertainment
as
had
suffered
most
from
his
scandalous
system
of
oppression
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
his
progress
,
he
was
brought
to
the
Three
Cranes
in
the
Vintry
,
before
which
an
immense
concourse
was
assembled
to
witness
the
spectacle
.
<EOS>
Though
the
exhibition
made
by
the
culprit
,
seated
as
he
was
on
a
great
ragged
beast
purposely
selected
for
the
occasion
,
was
sufficiently
ludicrous
and
grotesque
to
excite
the
merriment
of
most
of
the
beholders
,
who
greeted
his
arrival
with
shouts
of
derisive
laughter
;
still
his
woe
-
begone
countenance
,
and
miserable
plight
<EOS>
—
for
he
was
covered
with
mud
from
head
to
foot
—
moved
the
compassion
of
the
good
-
natured
Madame
Bonaventure
,
as
she
gazed
at
him
from
one
of
the
upper
windows
of
her
hostel
,
and
the
feeling
was
increased
as
the
wretched
old
man
threw
a
beseeching
glance
at
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
stand
the
sight
no
longer
,
and
rushed
from
the
window
.
<EOS>
In
the
same
room
with
her
there
were
four
persons
,
who
had
been
partaking
of
a
plentiful
repast
,
as
was
proved
by
the
numerous
dishes
and
flasks
of
wine
garnishing
the
table
at
which
they
had
been
seated
,
and
they
,
too
,
as
well
as
the
hostess
,
on
hearing
the
noise
outside
the
tavern
,
had
rushed
to
the
windows
to
see
what
could
cause
so
much
disturbance
.
<EOS>
As
they
were
all
well
acquainted
with
the
old
usurer
and
his
mal
-
practices
,
the
spectacle
had
a
special
interest
to
them
as
well
as
to
the
hostess
,
and
they
were
variously
affected
by
it
.
<EOS>
The
party
,
we
must
state
,
consisted
of
Master
Richard
Taverner
,
as
the
quondam
apprentice
was
now
styled
,
and
his
pretty
wife
,
Gillian
,
who
now
looked
prettier
than
usual
in
her
wedding
attire
—
for
the
ceremony
uniting
them
in
indissoluble
bonds
had
only
just
been
performed
;
old
Greenford
,
the
grandsire
of
the
bride
;
and
Master
John
Wolfe
,
of
the
Bible
and
Crown
in
Paul
's
Churchyard
,
bookseller
,
erstwhile
Dick
's
indulgent
master
,
and
now
his
partner
,
Master
Taverner
having
very
prudently
invested
the
contents
of
the
silver
coffer
in
the
purchase
of
a
share
in
his
employers
business
,
with
the
laudable
determination
of
bestirring
himself
zealously
in
it
ever
after
;
and
,
as
another
opportunity
may
not
occur
for
mentioning
the
circumstance
,
we
will
add
that
he
kept
to
his
resolution
,
and
ultimately
rose
to
high
offices
in
the
city
.
<EOS>
Dick
's
appearance
had
already
considerably
improved
.
<EOS>
His
apparel
was
spruce
and
neat
,
but
not
showy
,
and
well
became
him
;
while
his
deportment
,
even
under
the
blissful
circumstances
in
which
he
was
placed
,
had
a
sobriety
and
decorum
about
it
really
surprising
,
and
which
argued
well
for
his
future
good
conduct
.
<EOS>
He
began
as
he
meant
to
go
on
;
and
it
was
plain
that
John
Wolfe
's
advice
had
produced
a
salutary
effect
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Old
Greenford
looked
the
picture
of
happiness
.
<EOS>
With
Master
Richard
's
predilections
for
the
Three
Cranes
we
are
well
acquainted
,
and
it
will
not
,
therefore
,
appear
unnatural
that
he
should
choose
this
,
his
favourite
tavern
,
for
his
wedding
-
dinner
.
<EOS>
Madame
Bonaventure
was
delighted
with
the
bride
,
and
brought
the
blushes
to
her
fair
cheeks
by
the
warmth
of
her
praises
of
her
beauty
;
while
she
could
not
sufficiently
congratulate
the
bridegroom
on
his
good
luck
in
obtaining
such
a
treasure
.
<EOS>
The
best
in
the
house
was
set
before
them
—
both
viands
and
wine
—
and
ample
justice
was
done
by
all
to
the
good
cheer
.
<EOS>
Cyprien
,
as
usual
,
brought
in
the
dishes
,
and
filled
the
flagons
with
the
rare
Bordeaux
he
had
been
directed
by
his
mistress
to
introduce
;
but
Madame
Bonaventure
personally
superintended
the
repast
,
carving
the
meats
,
selecting
the
most
delicate
bits
for
Gillian
's
especial
consumption
,
and
seasoning
them
yet
more
agreeably
with
her
lively
sallies
.
<EOS>
The
dinner
had
come
to
a
close
,
and
they
were
just
drinking
the
health
of
the
bonny
and
blushing
bride
,
when
the
clamour
on
the
quay
proclaimed
the
old
usurer
's
arrival
.
<EOS>
As
he
was
the
furthest
person
from
her
thoughts
,
and
as
she
had
not
heard
of
the
day
appointed
for
his
punishment
,
Madame
Bonaventure
was
totally
unprepared
for
the
spectacle
offered
to
her
when
she
reached
the
window
;
and
her
retreat
from
it
,
as
we
have
related
,
was
almost
immediate
.
<EOS>
To
his
shame
be
it
spoken
,
Master
Richard
Taverner
was
greatly
entertained
by
the
doleful
appear
of
his
old
enemy
,
and
could
not
help
exulting
over
his
downfall
and
distress
;
but
he
was
quickly
checked
by
his
bride
,
who
shared
in
the
hostess
's
gentler
and
more
compassionate
feelings
.
<EOS>
So
much
,
indeed
,
was
the
gentle
Gillian
touched
by
the
delinquent
's
supplicating
looks
,
that
she
yielded
to
the
impulse
that
prompted
her
to
afford
him
some
solace
,
and
snatching
up
a
flask
of
wine
and
a
flagon
from
the
table
,
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
,
followed
by
her
husband
,
who
vainly
endeavoured
to
stay
her
.
<EOS>
In
a
moment
Gillian
was
out
upon
the
quay
;
and
the
mounted
guard
stationed
round
the
prisoner
,
divining
her
purpose
,
kindly
drew
aside
to
let
her
pass
.
<EOS>
Filling
the
goblet
,
she
handed
it
to
the
old
man
,
who
eagerly
drained
it
,
and
breathed
a
blessing
on
her
as
he
returned
it
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
bystanders
said
the
blessing
would
turn
to
a
curse
—
but
it
was
not
so
;
and
so
well
pleased
was
Dick
with
what
his
good
wife
had
done
,
that
he
clasped
her
to
his
heart
before
all
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
This
incident
was
so
far
of
service
to
the
prisoner
,
that
it
saved
him
from
further
indignity
at
the
moment
.
<EOS>
The
mob
ceased
to
jeer
him
,
or
to
hurl
mud
and
missiles
at
him
,
and
listened
in
silence
to
the
public
crier
as
he
read
aloud
his
sentence
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
the
poor
wretch
and
his
escort
moved
away
to
the
Catherine
Wheel
,
in
the
Steelyard
,
where
a
less
kindly
reception
awaited
him
.
<EOS>
In
taking
leave
,
as
we
must
now
do
,
of
Master
Richard
Taverner
and
his
pretty
wife
,
it
gives
us
pleasure
to
say
that
they
were
as
happy
in
their
wedded
state
as
loving
couples
necessarily
must
be
.
<EOS>
We
may
add
that
they
lived
long
,
and
were
blessed
with
numerous
issue
—
so
noumerous
indeed
,
that
,
as
we
have
before
intimated
,
Dick
had
to
work
hard
all
the
rest
of
his
days
.
<EOS>
In
bidding
adieu
,
also
,
to
Madame
Bonaventure
,
which
we
do
with
regret
,
we
have
merely
to
state
that
she
did
not
reign
much
longer
over
the
destinies
of
the
Three
Cranes
,
but
resigned
in
favour
of
Cyprien
,
who
,
as
Monsieur
Latour
,
was
long
and
favourably
known
as
the
jovial
and
liberal
host
of
that
renowned
tavern
.
<EOS>
Various
reasons
were
assigned
for
Madame
Bonaventure
's
retirement
;
but
the
truth
was
,
that
having
made
money
enough
,
she
began
to
find
the
banks
of
the
Thames
too
damp
and
foggy
for
her
,
especially
during
the
winter
months
;
so
the
next
time
the
skipper
entered
the
river
,
having
previously
made
her
arrangements
,
she
embarked
on
board
his
vessel
,
and
returned
to
the
sunny
shores
of
the
Garonne
.
<EOS>
Mompesson
's
sentence
,
though
far
more
severe
and
opprobrious
than
that
of
the
elder
extortioner
,
was
thought
too
lenient
,
and
most
persons
were
of
opinion
that
,
considering
the
enormity
of
his
offences
,
his
life
ought
not
to
be
spared
.
<EOS>
But
they
judged
unadvisedly
.
<EOS>
Death
by
the
axe
,
or
even
by
the
rope
,
would
have
been
infinitely
preferred
by
the
criminal
himself
,
to
the
lingering
agonies
he
was
destined
to
endure
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
there
was
retributive
justice
in
the
sentence
,
that
doomed
him
to
undergo
tortures
similar
to
those
he
had
so
often
inflicted
on
others
.
<EOS>
The
pillory
was
erected
at
Charing
Cross
.
<EOS>
A
numerous
escort
was
required
to
protect
him
from
the
fury
of
the
mob
,
who
would
otherwise
have
torn
him
in
pieces
;
but
,
though
shielded
in
some
degree
from
their
active
vengeance
,
he
could
not
shut
his
ears
to
their
yells
and
execrations
.
<EOS>
Infuriated
thousands
were
collected
in
the
open
space
around
the
pillory
,
eager
to
glut
their
eyes
upon
the
savage
spectacle
;
and
the
shout
they
set
up
on
his
appearance
was
so
terrific
,
that
even
the
prisoner
,
undaunted
as
he
had
hitherto
shown
himself
,
was
shaken
by
it
,
and
lost
his
firmness
,
though
he
recovered
it
in
some
degree
as
he
mounted
the
huge
wooden
machine
,
conspicuous
at
a
distance
above
the
heads
of
the
raging
multitude
.
<EOS>
On
the
boards
on
which
he
had
to
stand
,
there
was
another
person
besides
the
tormentor,—and
<EOS>
the
sight
of
him
evidently
occasioned
the
criminal
great
disquietude
.
<EOS>
This
person
was
attired
in
black
,
with
a
broad
-
leaved
hat
pulled
down
over
his
brows
.
<EOS>
"What
doth
this
fellow
here
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
need
an
assistant
.
<EOS>
""I
know
not
that
,
"
replied
the
tormentor,—a
big
,
brawny
fellow
,
habited
in
a
leathern
jerkin
,
with
his
arms
bared
to
the
shoulder,—taking
up
his
hammer
and
selecting
a
couple
of
sharp
-
pointed
nails
;
"
but
in
any
case
he
has
an
order
from
the
Council
of
the
Star
-
Chamber
to
stand
here
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
prisoner
,
"
he
continued
roughly
and
authoritatively,—"place
your
head
in
this
hole
,
and
your
hands
here
.
<EOS>
"Since
<EOS>
resistance
would
have
been
vain
,
Mompesson
did
as
he
was
bidden
.
<EOS>
A
heavy
beam
descended
over
his
neck
and
wrists
,
and
fastened
him
down
immovably
;
while
,
amid
the
exulting
shouts
of
the
spectators
,
his
ears
were
nailed
to
the
wood
.
<EOS>
During
one
entire
hour
the
ponderous
machine
slowly
revolved
,
so
as
to
exhibit
him
to
all
the
assemblage
;
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
yet
more
barbarous
part
of
the
sentence
,
for
which
the
ferocious
mob
had
been
impatiently
waiting
,
was
carried
out
.
<EOS>
The
keen
knife
and
the
branding
-
iron
were
called
into
play
,
and
in
the
bleeding
and
mutilated
object
before
them
,
now
stamped
with
indelible
infamy
,
none
could
have
recognised
the
once
haughty
and
handsome
Sir
Giles
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
A
third
person
,
we
have
said
,
stood
upon
the
pillory
.
<EOS>
He
took
no
part
in
aiding
the
tormentor
in
his
task
;
but
he
watched
all
that
was
done
with
atrocious
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
Not
a
groan
—
not
the
quivering
of
a
muscle
escaped
him
.
<EOS>
He
felt
the
edge
of
the
knife
to
make
sure
it
was
sharp
enough
for
the
purpose
,
and
saw
that
the
iron
was
sufficiently
heated
to
burn
the
characters
of
shame
deeply
in
.
<EOS>
When
all
was
accomplished
,
he
seized
Mompesson
's
arm
,
and
,
in
a
voice
that
seemed
scarcely
human
,
cried,—"Now
,
I
have
paid
thee
back
in
part
for
the
injuries
thou
hast
done
me
.
<EOS>
Thou
wilt
never
mock
me
more!""In
part
!
"
groaned
Mompesson
.
"
<EOS>
Is
not
thy
vengeance
fully
satiated
?
<EOS>
What
more
wouldst
thou
have?""What
more
?
"
echoed
the
other
,
with
the
laugh
of
a
demon,—"for
every
day
of
anguish
thou
gavest
<EOS>
my
brother
in
his
dungeon
in
the
Fleet
<EOS>
I
would
have
a
month
—
a
year
,
I
would
not
have
thee
perish
too
soon
,
and
therefore
thou
shalt
be
better
cared
for
than
he
was
.
<EOS>
But
thou
shalt
never
escape
—
never
!
<EOS>
and
at
the
last
I
will
be
by
thy
side
.
<EOS>
"It
would
almost
seem
as
if
that
moment
were
come
,
for
,
as
the
words
were
uttered
,
Mompesson
fainted
from
loss
of
blood
and
intensity
of
pain
,
and
in
this
state
he
was
placed
upon
a
hurdle
tied
to
a
horse
's
heels
,
and
conveyed
back
to
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
As
threatened
,
he
was
doomed
to
long
and
solitary
imprisonment
,
and
the
only
person
,
beside
the
jailer
,
admitted
to
his
cell
,
was
his
unrelenting
foe
.
<EOS>
A
steel
mirror
was
hung
up
in
his
dungeon
,
so
that
he
might
see
to
what
extent
his
features
had
been
disfigured
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
three
years
rolled
by
—
years
of
uninterrupted
happiness
to
Sir
Jocelyn
and
Lady
Mounchensey
,
as
well
as
to
Master
Richard
Taverner
and
his
dame
;
but
of
increasing
gloom
to
the
captive
in
his
solitary
cell
in
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
Of
late
,
he
had
become
so
fierce
and
unmanageable
that
he
had
to
be
chained
to
the
wall
.
<EOS>
He
sprang
at
his
jailer
and
tried
to
strangle
him
,
and
gnashed
his
teeth
,
and
shook
his
fists
in
impotent
rage
at
Osmond
Mounchensey
.
<EOS>
But
again
his
mood
changed
,
and
he
would
supplicate
for
mercy
,
crawling
on
the
floor
,
and
trying
to
kiss
the
feet
of
his
enemy
,
who
spurned
him
from
him
.
<EOS>
Then
he
fell
sick
,
and
refused
his
food
;
and
,
as
the
sole
means
of
preserving
his
life
,
he
was
removed
to
an
airier
chamber
.
<EOS>
But
as
it
speedily
appeared
,
this
was
only
a
device
to
enable
him
to
escape
from
prison,—and
<EOS>
it
proved
successful
.
<EOS>
He
was
thought
to
be
so
ill
that
the
jailer
,
fancying
him
incapable
of
moving
,
became
negligent
,
and
when
Osmond
Mounchensey
next
appeared
,
the
prisoner
had
flown
.
<EOS>
How
he
had
effected
his
escape
<EOS>
no
one
<EOS>
could
at
first
explain
;
<EOS>
but
it
appeared
,
on
inquiry
,
that
he
had
been
assisted
by
two
of
his
old
myrmidons
,
Captain
Bludder
and
Staring
Hugh
,
both
of
whom
were
prisoners
at
the
time
in
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
Osmond
's
rage
knew
no
bounds
.
<EOS>
He
vowed
never
to
rest
till
he
had
traced
out
the
fugitive
,
and
brought
him
back
.
<EOS>
But
he
experienced
more
difficulty
in
the
quest
than
he
anticipated
.
<EOS>
No
one
was
better
acquainted
with
the
obscure
quarters
and
hiding
-
places
of
London
than
he
;
but
in
none
of
these
retreats
could
he
discover
the
object
of
his
search
.
<EOS>
The
potentates
of
Whitefriars
and
the
Mint
would
not
have
dared
to
harbour
such
an
offender
as
Mompesson
,
and
would
have
given
him
up
at
once
if
he
had
sought
refuge
in
their
territories
.
<EOS>
But
Osmond
satisfied
himself
,
by
a
perquisition
of
every
house
in
those
sanctuaries
,
that
he
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
Nor
had
any
one
been
seen
like
him
.
<EOS>
The
asylum
for
"
masterless
men
,
"
near
Smart
's
Quay
,
and
all
the
other
dens
for
thieves
and
criminals
hiding
from
justice
,
in
and
about
the
metropolis
,
were
searched
,
but
with
the
like
ill
result
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
Mompesson
had
contrived
entirely
to
baffle
the
vigilance
of
his
foe
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
Osmond
applied
to
Luke
Hatton
,
thinking
it
possible
his
cunning
might
suggest
some
plan
for
the
capture
of
the
fugitive
.
<EOS>
After
listening
with
the
greatest
attention
to
all
related
to
him
,
the
apothecary
pondered
for
awhile
,
and
then
said—"It
is
plain
he
has
trusted
no
one
with
his
retreat
,
but
I
think
I
can
find
him
.
<EOS>
Come
to
me
on
the
third
night
from
this
,
and
you
shall
hear
further
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
you
need
not
relax
your
own
search
,
though
,
if
it
be
as
I
suspect
,
failure
is
sure
to
attend
you
.
<EOS>
"Obliged
to
be
satisfied
with
this
promise
,
Osmond
departed
.
<EOS>
On
the
third
night
,
at
a
late
hour
,
he
returned
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
,
however
,
find
Luke
Hatton
.
<EOS>
The
apothecary
,
it
appeared
,
had
been
absent
from
home
during
the
last
three
days
,
and
the
old
woman
who
attended
upon
him
was
full
of
uneasiness
on
his
account
.
<EOS>
Her
master
,
she
said
,
had
left
a
letter
on
his
table
,
and
on
investigation
it
proved
to
be
for
Osmond
.
<EOS>
In
it
the
writer
directed
him
,
in
the
event
of
his
non
-
return
before
the
time
appointed
,
to
repair
without
delay
,
well
armed
,
to
the
vaults
beneath
Mompesson
's
old
habitation
near
the
Fleet
,
and
to
make
strict
search
for
him
throughout
them
.
<EOS>
He
also
acquainted
him
with
a
secret
entrance
into
the
house
,
contrived
in
the
walls
beneath
the
lofty
north
-
eastern
turret
.
<EOS>
On
reading
this
letter
,
Osmond
at
once
understood
his
ally
's
plan
,
together
with
its
danger
,
and
felt
that
,
as
he
had
not
returned
,
he
had
,
in
all
probability
,
fallen
a
victim
to
his
rashness
.
<EOS>
Telling
the
old
woman
whither
he
was
going
,
and
that
inquiries
might
be
made
there
for
him
on
the
morrow
,
if
he
did
not
re
-
appear
with
her
master
,
he
set
out
at
once
for
the
place
indicated
.
<EOS>
We
shall
,
however
,
precede
him
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
Mompesson
had
been
taken
to
the
Fleet
,
his
habitation
had
been
deserted
.
<EOS>
The
place
was
cursed
.
<EOS>
So
much
odium
attached
to
it,—so
many
fearful
tales
were
told
of
it,—that
no
one
would
dwell
there
.
<EOS>
At
the
time
of
its
owner
's
committal
,
it
was
stripped
of
all
its
contents
,
and
nothing
was
left
but
bare
walls
and
uncovered
floors
.
<EOS>
Even
these
,
from
neglect
and
desertion
,
had
become
dilapidated
,
and
a
drearier
and
more
desolate
place
could
not
be
imagined
.
<EOS>
Strict
search
had
been
made
by
the
officers
of
the
Star
-
Chamber
for
concealed
treasure
,
but
little
was
found
,
the
bulk
having
been
carried
off
,
as
before
related
,
by
the
myrmidons
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
it
was
supposed
there
were
other
secret
hoards
,
if
a
clue
to
them
could
only
be
found
.
<EOS>
Mompesson
had
been
interrogated
on
the
subject
;
but
he
only
made
answers
calculated
to
excite
the
cupidity
of
his
hearers
without
satisfying
them
,
and
they
fancied
he
was
deceiving
them
.
<EOS>
On
the
night
in
question
,
to
all
outward
appearance
,
the
house
was
sombre
and
deserted
as
usual
,
and
the
city
watch
who
passed
it
at
midnight
,
and
paused
before
its
rusty
gates
and
its
nailed
-
up
door
,
fancied
all
was
secure
.
<EOS>
The
moon
was
at
the
full
,
shining
brightly
on
the
sombre
stone
walls
of
the
mansion,—on
its
windows
,
and
on
the
lofty
corner
turret
,
whence
Mompesson
used
so
often
to
reconnoitre
the
captives
in
the
opposite
prison
;
and
,
as
certain
of
the
guard
looked
up
at
the
turret
,
they
laughed
at
its
present
emptiness
.
<EOS>
Yet
they
little
dreamed
who
was
there
at
the
time
,
regarding
them
from
the
narrow
loop
-
hole
.
<EOS>
After
the
pause
of
a
few
minutes
they
moved
on
,
and
the
gleam
of
their
halberts
was
presently
seen
,
as
they
crossed
Fleet
Bridge
,
and
marched
towards
Ludgate
.
<EOS>
About
two
hours
afterwards
the
watch
re
-
appeared
,
and
,
while
again
passing
the
house
,
the
attention
of
their
leader
was
attracted
by
an
unusual
appearance
in
the
masonry
near
the
north
-
east
angle
,
above
which
the
tall
turret
was
situated
.
<EOS>
On
closer
examination
,
the
irregularity
in
the
walls
was
found
to
be
produced
by
a
small
secret
door
,
which
was
left
partially
open
,
as
if
it
had
been
recently
used
.
<EOS>
The
suspicions
of
the
party
being
aroused
by
this
singular
circumstance
(
none
of
them
having
been
aware
of
the
existence
of
such
a
door
)
,
they
at
once
entered
the
house
,
resolved
to
make
strict
search
throughout
it
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
instance
,
they
scaled
the
turret
,
with
which
the
secret
outlet
communicated
by
a
narrow
winding
staircase
;
and
then
,
proceeding
to
the
interior
of
the
habitation
,
pursued
their
investigations
for
some
time
without
success
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
they
were
just
about
to
depart
,
when
a
sound
resembling
a
deep
groan
seemed
to
arise
from
the
cellars
which
they
had
not
visited
.
<EOS>
Hearing
this
,
they
immediately
rushed
down
,
and
made
an
extraordinary
discovery
.
<EOS>
To
explain
this
,
however
,
we
must
go
back
to
the
time
when
they
first
passed
the
house
.
<EOS>
We
then
mentioned
that
there
was
a
person
in
the
turret
watching
their
movements
.
<EOS>
As
they
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
Ludgate
,
this
individual
quitted
his
post
of
observation
,
and
,
descending
the
spiral
staircase
,
threaded
a
long
passage
in
the
darkness
,
like
one
familiar
with
the
place
,
until
he
arrived
at
a
particular
chamber
,
which
he
entered
;
and
,
without
pausing
,
proceeded
to
a
little
cabinet
beyond
it
.
<EOS>
The
moonlight
streaming
through
a
grated
window
,
showed
that
this
cabinet
had
been
completely
dismantled
;
stones
had
been
removed
from
the
walls
;
and
several
of
the
boards
composing
the
floor
,
had
been
torn
up
and
never
replaced
.
<EOS>
The
intruder
did
not
pass
beyond
the
door
,
but
,
after
gazing
for
a
few
minutes
at
the
scene
of
ruin
,
uttered
an
ejaculation
of
rage
,
and
retired
.
<EOS>
His
steps
might
have
been
next
heard
descending
the
great
stone
staircase
.
<EOS>
He
paused
not
a
moment
within
the
entrance
-
hall
,
but
made
his
way
along
a
side
passage
on
the
left
,
and
down
another
flight
of
steps
,
till
he
reached
a
subterranean
chamber
.
<EOS>
Here
all
would
have
been
profound
obscurity
,
had
it
not
been
for
a
lamp
set
on
the
ground
,
which
imperfectly
illumined
the
place
.
<EOS>
As
the
man
took
up
the
lamp
and
trimmed
it
,
the
light
fell
strongly
upon
his
features
,
and
revealed
all
their
hideousness
.
<EOS>
No
visage
,
except
that
of
Osmond
Mounchensey
,
could
be
more
appalling
than
this
person
's
,
and
the
mutilation
was
in
both
cases
the
same
.
<EOS>
It
is
needless
to
say
it
was
Mompesson
.
<EOS>
His
habiliments
were
sordid
;
and
his
beard
and
hair
,
grizzled
by
suffering
rather
than
age
,
were
wild
and
disordered
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
armed
both
with
sword
and
dagger
;
and
his
limbs
looked
muscular
and
active
as
ever
.
<EOS>
Casting
a
glance
towards
the
entrance
of
the
vault
as
if
to
make
quite
sure
he
was
not
observed
—
though
he
entertained
little
anxiety
on
that
score
—
Mompesson
stepped
towards
a
particular
part
of
the
wall
,
and
touching
a
spring
,
a
secret
door
(
not
to
be
detected
within
the
masonry
except
on
minute
examination
)
flew
open
,
and
disclosed
another
and
smaller
vault
.
<EOS>
Here
,
it
was
at
once
evident
,
was
concealed
the
treasure
that
had
escaped
the
clutches
of
the
myrmidons
and
the
officers
of
the
Star
-
Chamber
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
large
open
chest
at
the
further
end
,
full
of
corpulent
money
-
bags
,
any
one
of
which
would
have
gladdened
the
heart
of
a
miser
.
<EOS>
On
this
chest
Mompesson
's
gaze
was
so
greedily
fixed
that
he
did
not
notice
the
body
of
a
man
lying
directly
in
his
path
,
and
well
-
nigh
stumbled
over
it
.
<EOS>
Uttering
a
bitter
imprecation
,
he
held
down
the
lamp
,
and
beheld
the
countenance
of
Luke
Hatton
,
now
rigid
in
death
,
but
with
the
sardonic
grin
it
had
worn
throughout
life
still
impressed
upon
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
deep
gash
in
the
breast
of
the
dead
man
,
and
blood
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
"Accursed
<EOS>
spy
and
traitor
,
"
cried
Mompesson
,
as
he
took
hold
of
the
body
by
the
heels
and
dragged
it
to
one
corner—"thou
wilt
<EOS>
never
betray
me
more
.
<EOS>
What
brought
thee
here
<EOS>
I
know
not
,
unless
it
were
to
meet
the
death
thou
hast
merited
at
my
hands
.
<EOS>
Would
a
like
chance
might
bring
Osmond
Mounchensey
here
—
and
alone
—
I
would
desire
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
""Be
thy
wish
gratified
then
!
"
cried
a
voice
,
which
Mompesson
could
not
mistake
.
<EOS>
Looking
up
,
he
beheld
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
In
an
instant
his
hand
was
upon
his
sword
,
and
the
blade
gleamed
in
the
lamp
-
light
.
<EOS>
Osmond
had
likewise
plucked
forth
his
rapier
,
and
held
a
poignard
in
his
left
hand
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
moments
they
gazed
at
each
other
with
terrible
looks
,
their
breasts
animated
with
an
intensity
of
hatred
which
only
mortal
foes
,
met
under
such
circumstances
,
can
feel
.
<EOS>
So
fiercely
bloodthirsty
were
their
looks
that
their
disfigured
features
seemed
to
have
lost
all
traces
of
humanity
.
<EOS>
"Yield
<EOS>
thee
,
murtherous
villain
,
"
cried
Osmond
at
length
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
drag
thee
to
the
hangman
.
<EOS>
""Call
in
thy
fellows
,
and
thou
shalt
see
whether
I
will
yield
,
"
rejoined
Mompesson
,
with
a
laugh
of
defiance
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
none
at
my
back
,
"
rejoined
Osmond
;
"
I
will
force
thee
to
follow
me
alone!""Thou
art
alone
then
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Mompesson
;
"
that
is
all
I
desired!"And
,
without
a
word
more
,
he
commenced
the
attack
.
<EOS>
During
the
brief
colloquy
just
detailed
,
he
had
noticed
that
his
enemy
was
doubly
armed
,
and
before
beginning
the
conflict
he
drew
his
own
dagger
,
so
that
there
was
no
greater
advantage
on
one
side
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
Both
were
admirable
swordsmen
,
and
in
strength
they
were
nearly
matched
;
but
the
combat
was
conducted
with
a
ferocity
that
almost
set
skill
at
defiance
.
<EOS>
After
the
exchange
of
a
few
desperate
passes
,
they
closed
;
and
in
the
terrific
struggle
that
ensued
the
lamp
was
extinguished
.
<EOS>
The
profound
darkness
prevented
them
from
seeing
the
frightful
wounds
they
inflicted
on
each
other
;
but
both
knew
they
were
severely
hurt
,
though
each
hoped
he
was
not
so
much
injured
as
his
adversary
.
<EOS>
Exhausted
,
at
length
,
by
loss
of
blood
,
and
ready
to
drop
,
they
released
each
other
by
mutual
consent
;
and
,
after
making
a
few
more
feeble
and
ineffectual
thrusts
,
leaned
upon
their
swords
for
support
.
<EOS>
"Wilt
<EOS>
thou
yield
now
,
villain
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Osmond
,
in
a
hoarse
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Or
must
I
finish
thee
outright?""Finish
me
!
"
<EOS>
echoed
Mompesson
,
in
tones
equally
hoarse
.
<EOS>
"
Strike
another
blow
against
me
if
thou
canst
.
<EOS>
But
I
well
know
thou
art
sped
.
<EOS>
When
I
have
recovered
breath
,
I
will
make
short
work
with
thee
.
<EOS>
""About
<EOS>
it
quickly
,
then
,
"
rejoined
Osmond
:
"
<EOS>
I
am
ready
for
thee
.
<EOS>
But
thy
boast
was
idle
.
<EOS>
Thou
art
bleeding
to
death
.
<EOS>
Twice
has
my
poignard
pierced
thy
breast
.
<EOS>
""Thou
wilt
never
use
thy
poignard
again
.
<EOS>
Thy
left
arm
is
disabled
,
"
rejoined
Mompesson—"besides
,
my
sword
passed
through
thee
almost
to
the
hilt
.
<EOS>
""It
glanced
from
my
doublet
:
I
scarcely
felt
the
scratch
.
<EOS>
""'Twas
<EOS>
a
scratch
deep
enough
to
let
thy
life
-
blood
out
.
<EOS>
But
since
thou
hast
more
to
be
spilt
,
have
at
thee
again!""Where
art
thou
?
"
cried
Osmond
,
staggering
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"Here
!
"
rejoined
Mompesson
,
avoiding
the
thrust
made
at
him
,
and
dealing
one
in
return
that
stretched
his
adversary
lifeless
at
his
feet
.
<EOS>
In
the
exultation
of
the
moment
,
he
forgot
his
own
desperate
condition
,
and
,
with
a
fierce
,
triumphant
laugh
,
set
his
foot
upon
the
body
of
his
prostrate
foe
.
<EOS>
But
a
mortal
faintness
seized
him
.
<EOS>
He
essayed
to
quit
the
vault
—
but
it
was
too
late
.
<EOS>
His
strength
was
utterly
gone
.
<EOS>
With
an
irrepressible
groan
,
he
fell
to
the
ground
,
close
beside
his
enemy
.
<EOS>
There
they
lay
,
the
dying
and
the
dead
,
for
more
than
an
hour
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
that
time
,
they
were
discovered
by
the
watch
.
<EOS>
Mompesson
yet
breathed
;
and
as
the
torch
-
light
fell
upon
the
scene
of
horror
,
he
slightly
raised
his
head
,
and
pointing
to
his
slaughtered
adversary
,
with
a
ghastly
smile
,
expired
.
<EOS>
THE
END
<EOS>
